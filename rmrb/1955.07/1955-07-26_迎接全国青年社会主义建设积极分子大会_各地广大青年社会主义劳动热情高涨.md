Xinhua News Agency, 25th: Young people throughout the country are enthusiastically welcoming the upcoming National Conference of Active Young Builders of Socialism in Beijing. Beijing, Tianjin, Shandong, Shanxi, Heilongjiang, Hunan, Guangdong, and other provinces and cities have already convened various types of conferences for active young builders of socialism, selecting outstanding young model figures to participate in the national conference.

　　To welcome the convening of this conference, young people on all fronts have demonstrated even greater labor enthusiasm. In some places, young people have put forward the slogan "Perform meritorious service for socialist construction and strive to participate in the conference." Two hundred and thirty-four young people at the Meishan Reservoir construction site proposed to implement the construction policy of "good, fast, economical, and safe," and complete the arch dam on time as a gift to the conference. The youth-crewed train group in the Taiyuan North Station locomotive section, to which Gong Zhixian and others belong, exceeded the set axis one hundred and twenty-one times, transporting more than 11,000 tons of cargo for the country, to welcome the convening of the conference.

　　In the anti-waste struggle, large numbers of youth conservation teams and conservation inspection groups are emerging in factories, enterprises, and basic construction departments. After the Shijiazhuang Freight Car Factory convened a conference of active young builders of socialism, young activists in the "dismantling" workshop took the lead in forming a youth conservation team, repairing more than forty pairs of old and discarded wheels, twenty-three pairs of which can already be used, saving the country more than 12,000 yuan. The youth conservation team of Pingxiang Coal Mine collected more than 33,000 kilograms of waste metal materials in May to welcome the convening of the conference.

　　In rural areas, young people are also welcoming the convening of the conference with active labor. Lü Yibao, director of the Tongxing Agricultural Production Cooperative in Kaizhou Village, Yixian County, Liaoning Province, and a member of the Communist Youth League, proposed to guarantee that he and the cooperative members would work hard to produce an average yield of 10,000 catties of corn and 3,000 catties of cotton per hectare. Under the slogan "Do a good job in summer harvesting and planting to welcome the convening of the conference," the youth of Furong Township, Pengze County, Jiangxi Province, completed the sowing of more than 1,700 mu of cotton fields in two days. In some places, the Communist Youth League organizations have also established honor rolls and honor boards to publicize the advanced deeds of young people in a timely manner, encouraging them to strive to be glorious active young builders of socialism.

    迎接全国青年社会主义建设积极分子大会
    各地广大青年社会主义劳动热情高涨
    据新华社二十五日讯　全国各地青年正热烈迎接将在北京召开的全国青年社会主义建设积极分子大会。北京、天津、山东、山西、黑龙江、湖南、广东等省市，已经先后召开过不同类型的青年社会主义建设积极分子大会，选出了优秀的青年模范人物，准备参加全国青年社会主义建设积极分子大会。
    为了迎接这次大会的召开，各个战线上的青年都发挥了更高的劳动热情。有些地方的青年提出了
  “为社会主义建设立功，争取参加大会”的口号。梅山水库工地二百三十四名青年提出要实现“好、快、省、安全”的施工方针，按时作好连拱坝，作为给大会的献礼。太原北站机务段弓芝宪等人所在的青年包乘组，为了迎接大会的召开，曾经超轴一百二十一次，给国家多运输货物一万一千多吨。
    在反浪费斗争中，大批青年节约队和节约检查组正在各工厂、企业和基本建设部门涌现出来。石家庄市货车工厂召开青年社会主义建设积极分子大会以后，“解体”车间的青年积极分子带头组成了青年节约队，修整了四十多对旧废车轮，其中有二十三对已经能够使用，为国家节约了一万二千多元。萍乡煤矿的青年节约队为了迎接大会的召开，五月份共收集了三万三千多公斤的废旧金属器材。
    在农村中，青年们也以积极的劳动来迎接大会的召开。辽宁省义县开州村同兴农业生产合作社主任、青年团员吕宜宝提出保证要和社员们一起努力生产，使每垧苞米平均产量达到一万斤，棉花产量达到三千斤。江西省彭泽县芙蓉乡青年在“搞好夏收夏种，迎接大会召开”的口号鼓舞下，二天内完成了一千七百多亩棉地的播种任务。有些地方的青年团组织还建立了光荣簿、光荣榜，及时把青年们的先进事迹公布出来，鼓舞他们争取做一个光荣的青年社会主义建设积极分子。
