    From "Adventurers' Paradise" to People's Copper Wall and Iron Bastion
    Delegate to the National People's Congress, Cao Jinghua
    Thirty-five years ago, I first arrived in Shanghai. One day, I passed by the entrance of the then "French Park." At the entrance stood a wooden sign about one square meter in size, with the park regulations written on it. One of the rules was: "Chinese in casual clothes and dogs are not allowed to enter." In Shanghai, under the trampling of imperialist bandits, it was not surprising to equate Chinese people with dogs and prohibit them from entering a park located on Chinese soil. But the fire of anger that it ignited in the hearts of the Chinese people was something these bandits could not extinguish!
    After the surrender of Japanese imperialism, Shanghai became even more of a place for American imperialists and their running dog Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang and hooligans to indulge in debauchery and run rampant. Shanghai became a breeding ground for sin. Regarding robbery cases, Shanghai averaged one per hour in 1946. Regarding opium addicts, one in every eighty households was affected. There were more than 4,000 registered prostitutes for hooligans and special agents to abuse. At that time, Shanghai became a large garbage pit where all kinds of social scum who oppressed the people gathered, including hooligans, secret agents, gamblers, habitual thieves, bandits, swindlers, foremen, speculators, and other motley crews. Adventurers from all over the world had long flocked here, scrambling to get in. Therefore, it had a title—"Adventurers' Paradise."
    However, Shanghai was also a steel furnace. It radiated heat and light, forging "real people," and these were the heroic Chinese Communists, who led the heroic struggle against Chiang Kai-shek's dark rule and American imperialist aggression. This was a difficult and great struggle. Mr. Lu Xun once said: "In these thirty years, I have witnessed the blood of many young people, accumulating in layers, burying me so that I cannot breathe." He was filled with boundless grief and indignation, writing the lines "Bear to see comrades become new ghosts, angrily seek small poems in the thicket of knives" to commemorate the sacrificed comrades. Taking literary and art workers as an example, who can forget Hu Yepin, Li Weisen, Rou Shi, Feng Keng, and Yin Fu, martyrs who were brutally murdered by the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang in Longhua in February 1931? In Lu Xun's words, quoting Ehrenburg, Shanghai at that time was precisely "on the one hand, solemn work, on the other hand, debauchery and shamelessness."

    I participated in the inspection work of the delegates to the National People's Congress and went to Shanghai.
    In the past, Shanghai's alleyways were filled with the ear-splitting sound of mahjong day and night, but now it's gone. We inspected various different alleyways and asked the residents if anyone still played mahjong now. They all answered with strange expressions: "Who still plays mahjong now?!" As if our question was too outdated.
    Shanghai used to be a famous gambling den. Now all kinds of gambling are gone.
    In the past, Shanghai was full of bars, jazz music, and drunken hooligans. Now it's gone.
    In the past, one in every eighty households was an opium addict. Now it's gone.
    In the past, hooligans gathered to cause trouble and beat people everywhere, but now it's gone. Even if there are disputes between people, they offer opinions and reason with each other.
    According to statistics in 1946, the city averaged one robbery case per hour. Now, taking the Huangpu District, which has a complex situation with 7,253 households and about 180,000 people, as an example, there hasn't been a single robbery or theft case in nearly half a year this year.
    Before liberation, there were more than 800 registered brothels and more than 4,000 prostitutes. After liberation, they were all taken in, their illnesses were cured, their health was restored, they learned culture and production techniques, developed labor habits, corrected their outlook on life, and embarked on the bright path of becoming new people. From June 1949 to April 1955, of the 4,105 prostitutes taken in, after being reformed, in addition to those who returned to their hometowns to engage in production, more than 1,200 people went to Xinjiang this year to participate in work. They all made assurances that they would dedicate their strength to the construction of the motherland. We saw a production and education center, which currently houses 1,145 people. They are all engaged in knitting socks, towels, woolen sets, sewing, and other work. They are all working skillfully and happily, and it's impossible to tell that they were all recently insulted and harmed. If the person in charge hadn't introduced the origin of this education center to you, you would really think it was a well-equipped semi-industrial factory. They have now all become producers who are beneficial to the people and respected by the people. Their faces all reveal the dignity and pride of "man" written in large letters, as Gorky said. It is the great Party that has transformed these living ghosts from hell yesterday into people in the new society. In particular, the spiritual trauma inflicted on them during the era of secret agent rule can only be healed by the Party.
    Chiang Kai-shek's bandit gang turned all of China into a large prison. However, the people's regime turned prisons into factories. Take Shanghai Municipal Prison in Tilanqiao as an example. This is one of the tools used by imperialists to suppress the Chinese people. It is the largest prison in China. In the past, the mention of Tilanqiao Prison could not help but send chills down one's spine. But now it's not like that. The prisoners currently detained here are all working and studying here in accordance with the government's principle of combining punishment and education. The workshops here are very spacious, with ample light and good ventilation. There are sewing, brush making, and goggle making sections. Rows of people are sitting in large workshops working. There is cultural, current affairs, and technical learning here. All kinds of "garbage" left over from the reactionary ruling era that are harmful to the people are collected here. This is not a prison, this is a "garbage" disposal plant, a "special factory," a special factory for transforming "souls," to turn garbage that harms the people into useful materials for the people. In recent years, more than 30,000 people have been reformed and released here, with very good results.
    In recent years, Shanghai's work in suppressing counter-revolutionaries and maintaining social order has been successful. One of the reasons for achieving this success is the correct implementation of Chairman Mao's instruction to rely on the masses. One of the methods is to organize residents' committees. There are currently more than 3,100 residents' committees and more than 59,000 groups in the city. The committees handle residents' public welfare, organize reading newspapers, cultural and current affairs studies, respond to all government calls, mediate disputes (more than 70,000 cases were mediated in 1953), and undertake security work. In short, the people have truly risen up to be masters of their own house, managing politics themselves. We went from the alleyways of upper and middle-class residents all the way to the Yaoshui Lane and Railway West Village in the slum areas, and even saw Baoxingli, one of the famous dens of filth and dirt before liberation. Everywhere we went, the scene was completely different. Tricycle workers and housewives have all actively participated in grassroots work, and some have become the backbone of residents' committees. Shanghai has always been the most complex city in the country, so complex that it is not easy to understand its "bottom line" even if you live in Shanghai for a lifetime. If a cadre does not rely on the masses to work there, it is like throwing a fish onto a sandy shore, and you can only worry without being able to do anything. Only the neighbors of the residents can understand it clearly. After liberation, the people rose up, they deeply realized that the regime was their own, and they personally felt that the happy life of living and working in peace was not easy to come by. Therefore, they do not allow any bad elements who disrupt the revolutionary order to exist. In this way, robbers, hooligans, secret agents, etc. are also under the watchful eyes of everyone, making it difficult for them to do evil. Let's take an example: Not long ago, late one night, a person carrying many things called for a tricycle. The tricycle worker found this passenger very suspicious, so he pulled him straight into the police station. The result was correct. This was a habitual thief. The person and the loot were brought to the door. If you don't rely on the masses, then the public security personnel will truly be "searching everywhere without finding anything!"
    Even so, due to historical roots, Shanghai is still the most complex city in the country, and it is also the frontline of national defense, one of the targets that the enemy attempts to sabotage. It has more than seven million people, with a large population mobility. Counter-revolutionaries who are not easy to hide anywhere in the country have fled to Shanghai. They change their names and surnames, fabricate history, forge documents, disguise themselves as people in various industries, open fake shops, pretend to be fake couples, make "life and death alliances," and even use "fake deaths" to cover up, that is, declare that someone has died, handle "funeral affairs," and cancel their household registration. Then this "dead person" safely uses a new name to come out and operate in another place. The enemy is treacherous and vicious. In order to protect the great Five-Year Plan of the motherland from being sabotaged by the enemy, the people of all regions are unanimously demanding: Resolutely suppress all counter-revolutionaries!

    One evening, I arrived at the park where "Chinese in casual clothes and dogs were not allowed to enter" in the past. Now mothers are pushing baby carriages and leisurely strolling by the fountain in the park. Children wearing red scarves are surrounding Uncle PLA and listening to him tell heroic stories about defending the great motherland. Laboring people after work are sitting on benches next to the lush lawn to rest, but in their hearts they are planning savings grain plans and labor competitions. The setting sun shines through the sparse leaves of the plane trees, casting its afterglow on their faces, reflecting the happy smiles floating on their lips. The rain-soaked ten sisters flowers are blooming so beautifully! Who knew that it was originally irrigated with the blood of countless martyrs!
    Shanghai, you are no longer the "paradise" of those adventurers of the past, you have become a base for supporting the great construction of various parts of the motherland! You are a copper wall and iron bastion defending the gate of the motherland!

### 由“冒险家的乐园”到人民的铜墙铁壁的堡垒

    由“冒险家的乐园”到人民的铜墙铁壁的堡垒
    全国人民代表大会代表　曹靖华
    三十五年前，我第一次到了上海。有一天，我从当时的“法国公园”的门口经过，门口竖着一平方公尺来大的木牌，牌上写着入园条例。其中有一条是：“穿便服的华人和狗，不准入内。”在帝国主义强盗蹂躏下的上海，把中国人同狗并列，不准入设在中国土地上的公园，那是不足为奇的。但这在中国人民的心坎里所燃起的愤火，却是这些强盗们无法扑灭的！
    日本帝国主义投降后，上海更成了美帝国主义及其走狗蒋介石匪帮和流氓荒淫游乐、横行霸道的场所。上海成了罪恶的渊薮。就抢案说，一九四六年上海平均每小时就有一件。就烟毒犯说，每八十户居民中就有一户。供流氓匪特蹂躏的登记的妓女就有四千多人。当时上海成了全国流氓、特务、赌棍、惯窃、土匪、骗子、把头、投机家及其他五花八门的欺压人民的社会渣滓所聚集的大垃圾坑。全世界的冒险家们，很早就争先恐后地涌向这里。因此它有一个称号——“冒险家的乐园”。
    然而，上海同时也是一座炼钢炉。它发着热，放着光，锻炼着“真正的人”，这就是英雄的中国共产党人，他们领导着反对蒋匪黑暗统治和美帝侵略的英雄的斗争。这是艰险的伟大斗争。鲁迅先生曾说：“在这三十年中，却使我目睹许多青年的血，层层淤积起来，将我埋得不能呼吸”。他充满了无限的悲愤，写着“忍看朋辈成新鬼，怒向刀丛觅小诗”的诗句，来纪念牺牲的战友。就以文艺工作者来说，谁能忘记一九三一年二月被蒋匪帮在龙华虐杀的胡也频、李伟森、柔石、冯铿、殷夫等烈士呢？用鲁迅先生引用爱伦堡的话说，当时的上海，正是“一方面是庄严的工作，一方面是荒淫与无耻。”

    我参加了这次全国人民代表大会代表的视察工作，到了上海。
    从前上海的里弄，无日无夜，到处都是一片刺耳的哗啦啦的麻将声，现在没有了。我们视察过各种不同的里弄，向居民问起现在究竟还有人打牌没有。他们都带着奇怪的神情回答说：“现在谁还打牌！？”仿佛我们的问题太落后了似的。
    从前上海是有名的赌窟。现在各种赌博没有了。
    从前上海到处都是酒巴间、爵士乐、醉醺醺的流氓。现在没有了。
    从前每八十户居民中，就有一户烟毒犯。现在没有了。
    从前到处是流氓聚众闹事，打人，现在不见了。人与人之间即有纠纷，也是提意见、说理。
    据一九四六年统计，全市平均每小时有抢案一件。现在以情况复杂的拥有七千二百五十三户、约十八万人口的黄浦区为例，今年将近半年的期间，抢案、盗案没有一件。
    解放前登记的妓院有八百多所，妓女有四千多人。解放后，把她们全收容起来，治好了病，恢复了健康，学到了文化和生产技术，养成了劳动习惯，端正了人生观，走上了重作新人的光明大道。从一九四九年六月起，到一九五五年四月止，收容的四千一百零五名妓女中，改造后，除还乡生产的以外，今年有一千二百多人赴新疆参加工作。她们都提出了保证，把力量献给祖国的建设。我们看了一个生产教养所，里边现有一千一百四十五人。她们都从事织袜子、毛巾、毛套、缝纫等工作。她们都在熟练地、愉快地工作着，完全看不出她们都是不久前被侮辱和被损害的人。要不是负责同志向你介绍这教养所的来历，你真要把它当成一个设备很好的半手工业工厂了。她们现在都成了有益于人民，为人民所敬重的生产者。她们脸上都流露着高尔基所说的用大字写的“人”的尊严和骄傲。这是伟大的党把昨天地狱里的这些活鬼，变成了新社会中的人。尤其是特务统治时代给她们的精神上的创伤，也只有党才能替她们医好。
    蒋匪帮的统治，把全中国变成了一所大监狱。而人民政权却把监狱当作工厂。拿提篮桥的上海市监狱来看吧。这是帝国主义者镇压中国人民的工具之一。是中国最大的一所监狱。从前一提起提篮桥监狱，不能不令人毛骨悚然。可是现在不是那样了。这里现在在押的犯人，都根据政府的惩罚和教育相结合的原则，在这儿工作着，学习着。这儿工作间很宽敞，光线充足，空气流通。有缝纫、制刷、制风镜等部分。一排排的人，都坐在大工作间里工作着。这里有文化、时事和技术学习。反动统治时代留下的有害于人民的各色各样的“垃圾”，都收集在这里，这并不是监狱，这是一所“垃圾”处理厂，是一所“特种工厂”，是改造“灵魂”的特种工厂，是要把为害人民的垃圾，变成于人民有用之材。几年来，这里已经改造释放的有三万多人，效果很好。
    几年来，上海市的“镇反”及社会治安工作是有成绩的。取得这成绩的原因之一，是正确地执行了毛主席的依靠群众的指示。方式之一，就是组织居民委员会。现全市共有三千一百来个居民委员会，五万九千多个小组。委员会办理居民公共福利，组织读报、文化及时学事习，响应政府一切号召，调解纠纷（一九五三年就调解了七万多件），担任保卫工作等。总之，人民真正起来当了家，作了主，自己来管理政治。我们从中上层居民的里弄，
  一直到贫民区的药水弄和铁路西村，甚至还看了解放前是藏垢纳污的著名的魔窟“三宝”之一的宝兴里。所到之处，面目全非。三轮工人，家庭妇女，都积极起来，参加了基层工作，有的成为居民委员会的骨干。上海从来是全国最复杂的城市，复杂得你在上海住一辈子也不容易摸清它的“底”。如果一个干部不依靠群众，到那里去工作，那就等于一条鱼被扔到沙岸上，你干急没办法。这只有居民的左邻右舍才摸得清。解放后，人民起来了，他们深刻地认识到政权是自己的，切身地感受到安居乐业的幸福生活得来的不易，因此，他们也不容许一切破坏革命秩序的坏分子存在。这样，强盗、流氓、特务等也就处于万目睽睽，难以为非作歹了。举一个例子看吧：不久前，在一个夜深人静的晚上，一个人带着好多东西叫三轮车，三轮工人觉得这乘客十分可疑，于是就拉着他一直拉进了派出所。结果没有错。这是一个惯窃。连人带赃都送上门来。如果不依靠群众，那才叫公安人员“踏破铁鞋无觅处”呢！
    虽然如此，由于历史的根源，上海还是全国最复杂的城市，又是国防前线，是敌人企图破坏的目标之一。它有七百多万人口，人口流动性大，全国到处不易藏身的反革命分子，都逃到上海。他们改名换姓，假造历史，伪造证件，化装各种行业的人，假开商店，扮假夫妻，订“生死同盟”，甚至用“假死”来掩护，就是声明某人已经死了，办了“丧事”，销了户口，然后这位“死人”就安全地在另一地方，用新姓名出来活动。敌人是险诈、恶毒的。为了保卫祖国伟大的五年计划不遭敌人破坏，各地人民都在一致要求：严厉镇压一切反革命分子！
              ×　×　×
    一天傍晚，我到了从前“穿便服的华人和狗，不准入内”的那个公园。现在母亲们推着婴儿的小车，安闲地在园内的喷水池边散步。带红领巾的儿童们，围着解放军叔叔，听他讲着保卫伟大祖国的英雄故事。工余之后的劳动人民，在绿草如茵的草坪旁的长椅上坐着休息，心里却盘算着节约用粮计划和劳动竞赛。夕阳透过梧桐的疏叶，把余辉投到他们的面孔上，映着唇边浮着的幸福的微笑。雨后的十姊妹花，开得多么娇艳！谁知那原是用无数烈士的血灌溉的呵！
    上海呵，你不再是当年那些冒险家的“乐园”，你变成了支援祖国各地伟大建设的基地！你是保卫祖国大门的铜墙铁壁的堡垒！
