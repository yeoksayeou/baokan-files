Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, July 2nd: Representatives from all circles in Hanoi, the capital of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, held a meeting at the Hanoi Grand Theater on the evening of the 1st, expressing the determination of the people of Hanoi to demand consultations and general elections.

The meeting was presided over by Yun Doushan, Chairman of the Hanoi Viet Lien Front. Chen Gongxiang, a representative of the Vietnam Central Unification Movement Committee, explained the importance of holding consultations and general elections at the meeting. Subsequently, representatives from the capital's workers, troops, intellectuals, business community, and religious circles spoke at the meeting.

Wu Jiaqian, a well-known model worker, said that workers in Hanoi factories are now working hard to increase production to promote the struggle for consultations and general elections with practical actions. The Hanoi Power Plant has increased its work efficiency by 25 percent, and other factories have also made significant achievements. The Vietnamese working class fully understands its responsibilities in this struggle. The Vietnamese working class is determined to unite with people from all walks of life to consolidate North Vietnam and resolutely strive to achieve consultations and general elections.

A representative of the armed forces said that no enemy can divide our country. We have a strong force and will surely crush the enemy's conspiracy to sabotage consultations and general elections.

Dr. Wu Gong Huai, a representative of Hanoi intellectuals, said that our struggle is just. Intellectuals are determined to participate in the work of consolidating the North and strive to defend peace and achieve the full implementation of the Geneva Accords.

At the meeting, Nguyen Manh Lu, a representative of the Hanoi Viet Lien Front, also reported on the situation of the capital's people's struggle for consultations and general elections during this period.

The meeting finally unanimously adopted a resolution guaranteeing that the people of Hanoi would unite and support the struggle for consultations and general elections.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, July 3rd: The movement demanding consultations and general elections is deeply unfolding in various factories and mines in Vietnam.

Power plants, water companies, and tram companies in Hanoi have recently held meetings to hear reports on the situation of the city's laboring people's congress demanding consultations and general elections. At the entrance of the workshop of the Gia Lam Train Repair Factory, workers wrote the words "July 20" on huge placards, expressing their demand to start consultations on July 20 to discuss general elections.

"Demanding consultations and general elections with practical actions" has become the most powerful combat slogan of the Anfu Power Plant in Hanoi. The plant's line repair workers raced to repair the lines on a stormy night at the end of June, completing a task that would have taken more than a week in just one day.

　　河内各界代表集会要求举行协商和普选
    据新华社河内二日电　越南民主共和国首都河内各界代表七百多人一日晚在河内大戏院举行大会，表示河内各界人民要求举行协商和普选的决心。
    大会由河内市越联战线主席允斗善主持。越南中央统一运动委员会代表陈公祥在会上讲解了举行协商和普选的重要意义。随后，首都的工人、部队和知识界、工商界、宗教界的代表纷纷在会上讲话。
    著名劳动模范吴嘉嵌说，现在河内各工厂工人都在努力增加生产以实际行动推进争取协商和普选的斗争，河内发电厂已提高工作效率百分之二十五，其他各厂也有了显著成绩。河内工人完全知道自己在这一斗争中应负的责任。越南工人阶级决心和其他各阶层人民团结一致巩固北越，坚决争取实现协商和普选。
    部队代表说，任何敌人不能分割我们的国家，我们有强大的力量，一定能粉碎敌人破坏协商和普选的阴谋。
    河内知识分子代表武公槐博士说，我们的斗争是正义的，知识分子都决心参加巩固北部的工作，为保卫和平、争取日内瓦协定的全部实现而奋斗。
    在会上，河内越联战线代表阮孟旅还报告了这一时期首都人民要求举行协商、普选的斗争的情况。
    大会最后一致通过了决议，保证河内人民将团结一致，支持争取协商、普选的斗争。
    据新华社河内三日电　要求协商普选的运动在越南各工厂、矿山中深入展开。
    河内的发电厂、自来水公司、电车公司等都在最近举行了集会，听取了要求协商和普选的全市劳动人民大会情况的传达报告。在嘉林火车修理厂的车间门口，工人在巨大的纸牌上写着“七·二○”的字样，表示要求在七月二十日这一天开始举行协商以讨论普选。
    “以实际行动要求协商普选”已成为河内安福发电厂最有力的战斗口号。厂里的线路修理工人在六月底狂风暴雨的夜晚抢修线路，使过去需要一个多星期的工作一天内便完成了。
