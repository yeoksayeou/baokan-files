People's Democratic Countries' Newspapers

    The Polish "People's Tribune" published an editorial stating: The heads of government of the four powers have reached an agreement on the general principles for further negotiations on major international issues, and the foreign ministers will seek solutions to these issues. This conference proves that agreements can be reached on difficult issues through sincere consultation.
    The Czechoslovakian "Red Right" wrote that this conference will signify the beginning of a new stage in relations between countries and peoples. All the people of Czechoslovakia welcome the positive results of the conference with deep satisfaction and will strengthen their efforts to safeguard peace in the future.
    The Bulgarian "Workers' Cause" wrote: The results of the conference have strengthened the belief of the peoples of all countries that as long as the "Cold War" is ended, the tense situation in international relations can be eased and the threat of war can be eliminated. The Bulgarian people, like the people of all countries, hope that the work to be carried out by the foreign ministers of the four powers and various international organizations will achieve greater success.
    "Free Romania" said in an editorial that the Geneva Conference created the necessary conditions for solving problems on a peaceful basis. The magnificent edifice of lasting peace has only just been laid, and it should not be forgotten that the People's Republic of China, which accounts for a quarter of the world's population, should also have its say in this regard.

Indian Newspapers

    Indian newspapers widely commented on the results of the Geneva Four-Power Summit.
    An editorial in the "Hindustan Standard" stated that "the agreement reached by the four major powers is encouraging and at least gives hope that this is a new stage in international relations." The editorial also mentioned that tensions in the Far East remain, and the instructions given by the heads of government of the four powers to the foreign ministers only involve European issues, making some kind of Asian conference even more urgent, because world peace is indivisible. The newspaper called on Western countries to change their hostile attitude towards China.
    An editorial in "The Times of India" pointed out that the four major powers have made an encouraging start on the road to international harmony and cooperation.

Western Newspapers

    American newspapers widely commented on the results of the Four-Power Summit in Geneva. The common conclusion reached by all reports and comments on this issue is that the heads of government of the four powers unanimously agreed to "further seek an end to the decade-long Cold War." Most American commentators emphasized that although the conference "did not solve any major international problems," it promoted the easing of international tensions and the improvement of East-West relations.
    "New York Herald Tribune" wrote in an editorial that one of the main results of the Geneva conference was to make people realize that "a war using thermonuclear weapons is simply not a solution to disputes." The editorial continued: "Disputes will continue to exist, no one doubts this, but other methods are needed to resolve disputes, and both East and West must do so."
    "New York Times" commentator Marvachi wrote: "The atmosphere in international relations has improved. A period of reconciliation has begun..." The commentator simultaneously attempted to cast doubt on the Soviet Union's peaceful intentions.
    Another commentator for the "New York Times," Hamilton, emphasized that after the Geneva Conference, "the China issue remains unresolved." Although some Western groups are unwilling to grant the People's Republic of China a seat in the United Nations, there is a growing sentiment in favor of China in the United Nations General Assembly.
    Editorials in most British newspapers pointed out that the Four-Power Summit made a positive contribution to easing international tensions.
    "Daily Mail" said: "The long-awaited bridge between East and West seems to be about to be built. The atmosphere is much better than before."
    "Daily Herald" said that the Geneva Conference "inspired the world's hope for peace. It has not disappointed the long-term efforts to urge the heads of the four powers to face the facts and negotiate face-to-face at the conference table."
    The "Daily Worker" said in an editorial: "The signpost in Geneva is very clear. The road to peace has been embarked upon. Indeed, we have not gone very far on that road, and without the vigilance of the people, we may still deviate from this road. But the important thing is that we are now on the right path, and this is the first time since the end of the Second World War."
    The "Scotsman" wrote in an editorial: "Although it seems that peaceful coexistence in Europe is guaranteed, there are still some explosive issues in the Far East that Geneva did not address."
    The West German business newspaper "Die Welt" pointed out that the Geneva Four-Power Summit "eased tensions between East and West." The newspaper said that the discussion of the German reunification issue at the Geneva Conference proved that if West Germany does not want to stalemate the German reunification issue, it should exert new political initiative, especially in direct negotiations with Russia.
    The "Neue Rhein Zeitung" wrote that West Germany should have as much contact with the German Democratic Republic as possible. The newspaper pointed out that Adenauer is currently pursuing a policy against peaceful development, and the newspaper called for a change in this "outdated" course.
    West Berlin's "Telegraf" said that when the four powers are approaching each other on the issue of disarmament, the Bonn government is vigorously rearming, which is absurd. (Xinhua News Agency)

    日内瓦会议有助于缓和国际紧张局势
    ——各国对四国政府首脑会议的评论
    人民民主国家报纸
    波兰“人民论坛报”发表社论说：四国政府首脑对于进一步谈判重大国际问题的一般原则已经取得了协议，外长们将就这些问题寻找解决办法。这次会议证明，通过真诚的协商是可以在困难的问题上达成协议的。
    捷克斯洛伐克“红色权利报”写道，这次会议将意味着各国和各国人民之间关系的新阶段的开始。捷克斯洛伐克全体人民以深感满意的心情欢迎会议的积极结果，今后将加强他们维护和平的努力。
    保加利亚“工人事业报”写道：会议的结果加强了各国人民的这种信念：只要结束“冷战”，国际关系中的紧张局势就可以缓和，战争威胁就可以消除。保加利亚人民和各国人民一样希望：四国外长们和各种国际机构将要进行的工作能够获得更大的成就。
    “自由罗马尼亚报”在社论中说，日内瓦会议创造了在和平基础上解决问题的必要条件。宏伟的持久和平大厦还不过刚刚奠定基础，还不应该忘记，占全世界人口四分之一的中华人民共和国在这方面也应该有它的发言权。
    印度报纸
    印度报纸广泛评论日内瓦四国政府首脑会议的结果。
    “印度斯坦旗报”的社论说，“四大国达成的协议是令人鼓舞的，至少可以使人希望这是国际关系中的新阶段”。社论并谈到远东紧张局势依然存在，四国政府首脑给外长们的指示只涉及欧洲问题，举行某种亚洲会议变得更为迫切了，因为世界和平是不可分割的。这家报纸要求西方国家改变敌视中国的态度。
    “印度时报”的社论中指出，四大国在通向国际和谐和合作的道路上作了令人鼓舞的开端。
    西方国家报纸
    美国报纸广泛评论四国政府首脑会议的结果，所有报道和评论就这个问题得出的共同结论是，四国政府首脑一致同意“进一步谋求结束十年的冷战”。大多数美国评论员着重指出，这个会议虽然“没有解决什么主要的国际问题”，但是它促进了国际紧张局势的缓和和东西方关系的改善。
    “纽约先驱论坛报”在社论中写道，日内瓦会议的主要结果之一是使人们认识到，“使用热核子武器的战争根本就不是解决争端的办法”。社论接着说：“争端将继续存在，这是没有人怀疑的，但是，需要用其他的方法来解决争端，无论东方和西方都要这样做。”
    “纽约时报”的评论员马瓦契写道：“国际关系中的气氛已经得到改善。和解的时期已经开始了……。”这个评论员同时企图使人怀疑苏联的和平意图。
    “纽约时报”另一个评论员汉密尔顿着重指出，在日内瓦会议以后，“中国问题仍然没有解决”，尽管某些西方集团不愿意给予中华人民共和国以联合国的席位，但是，在联合国大会中，有利于中国的情绪却在日益增长。
    英国大多数报纸的社论都指出，四国政府首脑会议对缓和国际紧张局势作出了积极的贡献。
    “每日邮报”说：“人们期待已久的东西方之间的桥梁似乎快要架好了。这种气氛比以前不知要好多少。”
    “每日先驱报”说，日内瓦会议“鼓舞了世界对和平的希望。它没有辜负长时期来促使四国首脑面对事实和面对面地在会议桌上来进行谈判的努力。”
    “工人日报”在社论中说：“日内瓦的路标是十分明确的。已经走上了通往和平的道路。的确，我们在那条道路上还没有走得很远，并且如果没有人民的警惕，还可能会离开这条道路。但是，重要的一点是现在已经走上了正确的道路，这在第二次世界大战结束后还是第一次。”
    “苏格兰人报”在社论中写道：“虽然说，看起来在欧洲和平共处有了保证，但是在远东还存在着日内瓦所没有谈到的一些爆炸性的问题。”
    西德商业界报纸“世界报”指出，日内瓦四国政府首脑会议“缓和了东方和西方之间的紧张局势”。报纸说，在日内瓦会议上对于统一德国问题的讨论证明：如果西德不是想使统一德国的问题陷于僵局，它就应当发挥新的政治主动精神，特别是在同俄国进行直接谈判方面。
      “新莱因报”写道，西德应该尽可能多同德意志民主共和国接触。报纸指出，阿登纳目前是在执行着反对和平发展的政策，报纸要求改变这种“过时的”路线。
    西柏林的“电讯报”说，当四国在裁军问题上趋于接近的时候，波恩政府却在大力进行重新武装，这种做法是荒谬的。　（据新华社讯）
