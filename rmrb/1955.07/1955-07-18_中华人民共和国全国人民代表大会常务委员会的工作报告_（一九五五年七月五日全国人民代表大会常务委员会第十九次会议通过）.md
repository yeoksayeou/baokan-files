Peng Zhen, Vice Chairman and Secretary-General of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress

Fellow Deputies:

On behalf of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, I am reporting to the Congress on our work.

In the nine months since the closing of the First Session of the First National People's Congress, the Standing Committee has convened a total of nineteen meetings, passing forty resolutions and three hundred and thirty cases of appointments and removals of state personnel.

In international affairs, in accordance with the principles of the foreign policy stipulated in the Constitution, the Standing Committee, at its first meeting, passed a resolution approving the Cultural Cooperation Agreement between the People's Republic of China and the People's Republic of Albania; at its seventh meeting, regarding the issue of taking concrete steps to develop friendly cooperative relations among the people of all countries, passed a resolution responding to the Declaration of the Supreme Soviet of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics on February 9, 1955; at its ninth meeting, passed a resolution on ending the state of war between the People's Republic of China and Germany; and at its twelfth meeting, passed a resolution on deciding to appoint the chief representative and representatives of the delegation to the Asian-African Conference.

In terms of legislation, the Standing Committee, at its third meeting, formulated the Arrest and Detention Regulations of the People's Republic of China and the 1955 National Economic Construction Bond Regulations; at its fourth meeting, formulated the Organizational Regulations for Urban Street Offices, the Organizational Regulations for Urban Residents' Committees, and the Organizational Regulations for Public Security Police Stations. At its fifth meeting, the Standing Committee, upon the proposal of the State Council, adopted the Military Service Law of the People's Republic of China (Revised Draft) and decided that the State Council would print and distribute the Military Service Law of the People's Republic of China (Revised Draft) to people's committees at all levels for discussion and to solicit public opinions. The current session of the National People's Congress has included the Military Service Law of the People's Republic of China on its agenda. The Standing Committee, at its sixth meeting, formulated the Regulations on the Service of Officers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army; at its seventh meeting, passed the Resolution on Stipulating the Awarding of Medals and Decorations to Meritorious Personnel of the Chinese People's Liberation Army During the Chinese People's Revolutionary War Period, formulated the Regulations of the People's Republic of China on Awarding Medals and Decorations to Meritorious Personnel of the Chinese People's Liberation Army During the Chinese People's Revolutionary War Period, passed the Resolution on Stipulating the Awarding of Medals and Decorations to Meritorious Personnel of the Chinese People's Liberation Army in Defending the Motherland and Carrying Out National Defense Modernization, and passed the Resolution on Awarding Medals and Decorations to Meritorious Personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteers in Resisting America and Aiding Korea, Protecting Our Homes and Defending the Country.

In order to facilitate the review of the autonomous regulations and specific regulations of ethnic autonomous regions, the Standing Committee collected relevant materials and dispatched working groups to Xinjiang, Yunnan, and other places for investigation.

In addition, the Standing Committee is collecting materials and drafting criminal law and civil law.

The Standing Committee has received many letters requesting explanations of laws and decrees. In order to properly handle these issues, the Standing Committee, at its seventeenth meeting, passed the Resolution on the Interpretation of Laws, deciding that, in cases where the provisions of laws and decrees themselves require further clarification of boundaries or supplementary provisions, the Standing Committee shall provide explanations or enact laws and decrees separately; in cases concerning how to specifically apply laws and decrees in the trial process, the Judicial Committee of the Supreme People's Court shall provide explanations. Letters requesting interpretations of laws and decrees that pertain to academic or common-sense issues, because they have no binding force in law, have been decided to be referred to the Chinese Academy of Sciences for explanation or to the People's Daily for consultation with relevant departments for explanation. At its eighth meeting, the Standing Committee made decisions and provided explanations on the term of the first local people's congresses at all levels and the issue of the number of representatives to the current people's congress after changes in the administrative divisions of provinces, counties, and townships.

The Standing Committee, at its first meeting, approved the organization of the General Office of the Standing Committee, and at its eleventh meeting, upon the proposal of the Premier of the State Council, decided to establish the Third Ministry of Machine Building Industry. The Standing Committee, at its second meeting and at its eleventh meeting, upon the proposal of the Premier of the State Council, successively approved the establishment of twenty-two directly subordinate agencies of the State Council.

In the past nine months, among the appointments and removals of state personnel passed by the Standing Committee, there were twenty-one cases of appointments decided by the President of the People's Republic of China upon the Standing Committee's decision, five cases of removals decided by the President of the People's Republic of China upon the Standing Committee's decision, one hundred and six cases of appointments made by the Standing Committee, one hundred and seventy cases of appointments approved by the Standing Committee, and twenty-eight cases of removals approved by the Standing Committee. The aforementioned lists of appointments and removals have been compiled into a collection of Standing Committee meeting documents and distributed to all deputies for reference.

In the past nine months, the Standing Committee listened to and discussed Premier Zhou Enlai of the State Council's reports on the Sino-Soviet talks and on the Asian-African Conference, Vice Premier Li Xiannian of the State Council's reports on grain issues and the transformation of private commerce, Director Jia Tuofu of the Fourth Office of the State Council's report on the situation and problems of the national light industry, Member Zeng Xisheng of the Anhui Provincial People's Committee's report on the agricultural production situation in Anhui Province over the past two years, Governor Li Dazhang of Sichuan Province's report on agricultural production and rural work in Sichuan Province, and Governor Tao Zhu of Guangdong Province's report on agricultural production and overseas Chinese issues in Guangdong Province. In addition, the Standing Committee reviewed the Supreme People's Court's report on the main situation of judicial work in 1954 and the Supreme People's Procuratorate's report on the main situation and current tasks of its work.

The Standing Committee received three thousand four hundred and seven letters from the people. In addition to those that have been transferred to the relevant central departments or provincial and municipal people's committees for handling, the General Office of the Standing Committee conducted key inspections of cases involving accusations and charges against state personnel.

The Standing Committee received three hundred and forty-two letters from deputies to the National People's Congress. These letters, in addition to being distributed to members of the Standing Committee, were also transferred to the relevant central departments or provincial and municipal people's committees for handling. In order to facilitate the work of the deputies, the Standing Committee passed the Resolution on Establishing Offices for Deputies to the National People's Congress at its seventh meeting. At its sixteenth meeting, the Standing Committee decided to notify deputies to the National People's Congress to take some time before this congress to inspect work in the areas of their original electoral units, their places of origin, or other areas, as much as possible. With the exception of those who are old and weak or who cannot leave their posts due to work reasons, the vast majority of deputies have conducted inspections, widely understood the political, economic, cultural, and various work situations in various places, understood the opinions and demands of the people, and strengthened the ties between the deputies to the National People's Congress and the people.

Because evidence has been found that Deputies Pan Hannian and Hu Feng have engaged in counter-revolutionary activities, the Standing Committee, at its ninth meeting and at its sixteenth meeting, upon the request of Procurator-General Zhang Dingcheng of the Supreme People's Procuratorate, and in accordance with the provisions of Article 37 of the Constitution, has successively approved their arrest and trial.

The above is the main work situation of the Standing Committee over the past nine months. The various resolutions and appointment/removal cases have been distributed to all deputies for review.
