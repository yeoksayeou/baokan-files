Xinhua News Agency, July 12th—U.S. military chiefs responsible for implementing U.S. aggression policies in the Taiwan area have recently been conducting activities one after another on Chinese coastal islands occupied by the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique.
    On July 11th, the newly appointed chief of the U.S. Military Assistance Advisory Group in Taiwan, Smith, and his key staff arrived at Kinmen Island. They listened to reports from the local Chiang bandit troops and inspected the Chiang bandit troops and their positions. They stated that the United States would ship more aid weapons to Kinmen.
    Prior to this, the new Chief of Staff of the Taiwan Liaison Center, Surno, also visited Kinmen Island on the 7th to "understand the general situation of the Kinmen battlefield." On the same day, U.S. Seventh Fleet Commander Pride visited Matsu Island.
    These activities by U.S. military chiefs show that the United States is intensifying its efforts to obstruct the Chinese people's liberation of the coastal islands.

    美国军事首脑接连到蒋贼盘踞下的沿海岛屿进行活动
    新华社十二日讯　负责在台湾地区执行美国侵略政策的美国军事首脑，最近接连到蒋介石卖国集团盘踞下的中国沿海岛屿进行活动。
    七月十一日，新任美国驻台湾军事援助顾问团团长史密斯和他的重要工作人员到达金门岛。他们听取了当地蒋贼军的报告，视察了蒋贼军部队和阵地。他们表示，美国将把更多的援助武器运往金门。
    在这以前，新任台湾联络中心参谋长苏诺也曾在七日到金门岛活动，“了解金门战地的一般情况”。同一天，美国第七舰队司令普赖德访问了马祖岛。
    美国军事首脑的这类活动表明，美国正在加紧阻挠中国人民解放沿海岛屿的活动。
