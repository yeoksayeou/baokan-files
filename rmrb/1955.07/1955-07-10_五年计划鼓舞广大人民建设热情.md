　　Five-Year Plan Inspires Great Enthusiasm for Construction Among the People
　　Capital's People Resolve to Promote Plan's Implementation
　　Xinhua News Agency report: The report on the First Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy, delivered by Vice Premier of the State Council Li Fuchun, has sparked great enthusiasm among the people of the capital for building a great motherland. In addition to the broad masses of workers expressing their determination to strive to complete the Five-Year Plan, young students, suburban farmers, and people in industry and commerce in the capital have also expressed their intention to use practical actions to promote the smooth realization of the Five-Year Plan.
　　At Tsinghua University, a group of students from Class 4, Grade 4, majoring in hydraulic structure, an advanced collective graduating in a month, held a forum. The water conservancy projects in the Five-Year Plan to harness the Yellow River and Huai River are most closely related to them and excite them the most. Yang Qisheng, a student who interned at the Nanwan and Meishan reservoirs, said: "We must do our best in the implementation of the Five-Year Plan so that 'the Yellow River flows with clear water, and barren land is transformed into fertile fields!'" Professor Li Jixiang of the Department of Mechanical Engineering said after learning the content of the Five-Year Plan: "Industrial construction, especially heavy industry, needs mechanical manufacturing in every aspect. Our responsibility is significant. We must improve the quality of teaching and train cadres with better political and professional qualities for the country." On the morning of the 8th, a large batch of newspapers retailed by the post office vendor at Beijing Normal University were quickly sold out. Zhu Tian'en, chairman of the student union of the North Campus, said after reading the newspaper:
　　"The motherland's First Five-Year Plan has brought us great excitement and encouragement. In the arduous struggle to realize this great plan, the responsibility of each of us is significant. The labor of each person is a necessary component of this plan. For us students of the Normal University—the future people's teachers—we bear a particularly important responsibility in training construction cadres for the motherland. We will study politics and scientific knowledge even harder, learn educational theory well, strengthen our bodies, and strive to realize the First Five-Year Plan!"
　　Members of the Dahongmen Mingxing Agricultural Production Cooperative in the suburbs of Beijing expressed their warm support for the report on the First Five-Year Plan. Member Liu Zhenxiang said: "Old China was very backward in all aspects under the reactionary rule of Chiang Kai-shek. We must change this backward state. The First Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy is the best way to change the backward state step by step. In the implementation of the plan, we farmers must work hard to produce and supply the country with industrial raw materials and grain." The members of the Huayuanzha No. 1 Agricultural Production Cooperative in the Eastern Suburbs held a forum during their rest time. Everyone affirmed based on personal experience that developing agricultural production cooperatives is the only measure to realize increased agricultural production. Last year, this cooperative planted 359 mu of wheat, with an average yield of 190 jin per mu. 社员Bi Shaowen could not afford to plant wheat before joining the cooperative. After joining, he got more than 200 jin of wheat this year. He, therefore, realized that agricultural production cooperatives are the only way for farmers to live a prosperous life. The explanation in the report about expanding the planting area of ​​tubers was generally supported by the members. The cooperative originally planned to plant 60 mu of late sweet potatoes, but now it plans to plant 100 mu. The members felt great interest in the mass production of new farm implements such as double-wheeled plows and walking plows in the Five-Year Plan. This is because the 378 mu of corn and millet they planted this year, due to the use of new-style weeding hoes, not only saved more than 100 man-days but also grew robustly.
　　Some members of the Beijing Federation of Industry and Commerce held a forum on the report on the First Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy. Ni Jiaxi said: "I am the capitalist party of a public-private partnership. I should automatically accept the leadership of the public shares, be dutiful and responsible, and gradually transform the enterprise into a socialist enterprise and myself into a socialist citizen." Li Yizan believes that the First Five-Year Plan enabled the industry and commerce circles to see the socialist prospects and also enhanced his confidence in accepting socialist transformation and working hard to build the country. He is engaged in the dairy industry. Seeing that Vice Premier Li Fuchun pointed out in his report the need to develop animal husbandry, he believed that this was absolutely necessary. This marks the improvement of people's living standards. Jiao Huanwu said: "In the past, private industry and commerce did not do enough in terms of patriotism and law-abiding, and many illegal incidents occurred. In the future, we must strengthen education and fight against illegal behaviors." Chang Ziju expressed that he would lead the grain, oil, and salt industry to do a good job in distribution and sales and work hard for the country's industrialization. Ma Xijun said: "Developing heavy industry is of great significance for the early arrival of a happy life for future generations. Handicraft industry can make a considerable contribution to the needs of the people. It is the correct direction to organize under the principle of voluntariness." Tang Shaoyuan believes that during the First Five-Year Plan period, private industry should give full play to all the potential of its original equipment and work hard to complete the First Five-Year Plan. Li Yizan proposed that factories processing orders should strive to save raw materials. He said: "At present, some people in private industry are unwilling to trial-produce new products, which is wrong. This is a reflection of the idea of ​​pursuing profit, and it should be reversed. Only by serving the national economy can it be beneficial to the realization of the Five-Year Plan."
　　Tianjin's Workers Show Great Enthusiasm for Conservation
　　Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 8th telegram: Vice Premier of the State Council Li Fuchun's "Report on the First Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy" delivered at the National People's Congress meeting has inspired the vast number of workers in Tianjin to further develop the enthusiasm for comprehensive conservation.
　　More than 2,000 employees of the state-owned Tianjin Steel Plant studied Li Fuchun's report. Labor models, advanced workers, and veteran technical workers also spontaneously held forums. Sun Yutian, the head of the youth steelmaking team, said: "We must work hard to increase production and ensure the completion of the tasks stipulated by the state." The Qiu Guanghe Model Group revised the July competition conditions after the forum, planning to increase steel production by 98 tons, save 18 tons of coal, and save 3,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity throughout the month, which can increase production and save the country 71,000 yuan in wealth. Zhang Jingxian, a female worker in the packaging section of the Zhonghua Match Factory, said: "Now I am more clear that light industrial workers should think of more ways to save raw materials. I must study the operating methods well and save raw materials in the future." Lin Tong, a building structure engineer at the Tianjin Building Design Company, said: "I will try my best to save steel in the design in the future. Saving one inch is equal to increasing one inch." The designers of this company are revising the building designs of more than 30 buildings, including schools and hospitals, according to the spirit of comprehensive conservation. According to preliminary statistics, they can save the country more than 700,000 yuan.
　　Shanghai People Strive to Complete the Plan Ahead of Schedule

Xia Jianbai, Vice President of Tongji University, said: "After reading Comrade Li Fuchun's report, it is as if I saw the blueprint for the country's socialist industrialization. This is an unprecedented beautiful blueprint. Only the new China of people's democracy under the leadership of the Communist Party of China can propose such a great plan." Xue Bangqi, President of Huadong Hospital, said: "Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report gave me great encouragement. In the future, everyone should work harder and strive to complete the First Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule so that socialism will come sooner." Jin Yaozu, a Shanghai People's Representative and Imam of the Hudong Mosque, said: "My country's First Five-Year Plan is a major step in realizing the general task of the country's transition period. People of all ethnic groups in the country must unite and work diligently and thriftily under the leadership of the Communist Party of China to complete this great plan."
　　Shenyang Workers Improve Labor Productivity

　　五年计划鼓舞广大人民建设热情
　　首都人民决心促进计划实现
    本报讯　国务院副总理李富春所作的关于发展国民经济的第一个五年计划的报告，在首都人民群众中引起了对于建设伟大祖国的高度热情。除广大职工群众表示要坚决为完成五年计划而奋斗外，首都的青年学生、郊区农民和工商界人士也都纷纷表示要用实际的行动来促进五年计划的顺利实现。
    在清华大学，一个月以后即将毕业的先进集体水工结构专业四年级四班的一些学生举行了座谈。五年计划中根治黄河、淮河的水利工程对他们关系最密切，也使他们最兴奋。曾在南湾、梅山水库实习过的学生杨启声说：“我们一定要在实现五年计划中尽自己最大的力量，使得‘黄河流碧水，赤地变良田！’”机械制造系教授李辑祥在知道了五年计划的内容以后说：工业建设尤其是重工业无论那方面都需要机械制造业。我们的责任是重大的。我们一定要提高教学质量，为国家培养出政治上和业务上质量都更好的干部。”八日早晨，邮局售报员送到北京师范大学零售的一大批报纸，一会儿就卖光了。北校学生会主席朱天恩读了报纸以后说：
  “祖国第一个五年计划给我们带来了极大的兴奋和鼓舞。在实现这个伟大计划的艰巨斗争中，我们每个人的责任是重大的。每个人的劳动都是这个计划的必要组成部分。对于我们师范大学的学生——未来的人民教师来说，在培养祖国建设干部方面，担负着特别重要的责任。我们将更加努力地学习政治和科学知识，学好教育理论，锻炼好身体，为实现第一个五年计划而奋斗！”
    北京郊区大红门明星农业生产合作社的社员们对第一个五年计划的报告表示热烈拥护。社员刘振湘说：“旧中国在蒋介石的反动统治下，各方面都非常落后。我们一定要改变这种落后状态。发展国民经济的第一个五年计划就是有步骤地改变落后状态的最好的办法。在实现计划中，我们农民要努力生产，供给国家工业原料和粮食。东郊区花园闸第一农业生产合作社的社员们利用休息时间进行了座谈。大家根据亲身的体验，肯定了发展农业生产合作社是实现农业增产的唯一措施。去年这个社种三百五十九亩小麦，平均每亩产量一百九十斤。社员毕绍文没有入社时，种不起麦子，入了社，今年就分得二百多斤麦子。他因此认识到农业生产合作社是使农民生活富裕的唯一道路。报告中关于扩大薯类播种面积的说明，受到社员们普遍的拥护。这个社原来计划种晚白薯六十亩，现在计划种一百亩。社员们对五年计划中要大量生产双铧犁、步犁等新式农具，感到莫大的兴趣。这是因为他们今年种的三百七十八亩玉米、谷子，由于用新式耘锄串了地，不但节省了一百多个人工，而且庄稼都长得茁壮。
    北京市工商业联合会部分常委座谈了关于发展国民经济的第一个五年计划的报告。倪家玺说：“我是公私合营的资方，应当自动的接受公股领导，守职尽责，把企业逐步改变为社会主义的企业，个人改变为社会主义公民。”李贻赞认为第一个五年计划使工商界看到了社会主义远景，也增强了他接受社会主义改造和努力建设的信心。他是搞牛乳业的。他看到李富春副总理报告中指出要发展畜牧业，他认为这是完全必要的。这标志着人民生活水平的提高。焦寰五说：“私营工商业过去在爱国守法方面做的不够，出现很多违法事件，今后要加强教育，对违法行为作斗争。”常子久表示要带动粮食油盐业做好经销工作，为国家工业化而努力。马锡钧说：“发展重工业是为了后代子子孙孙幸福生活早日到来，意义是很重大的。手工业对人民需要有相当贡献，要在自愿原则下组织起来，这是正确的方向。”汤绍远认为，在第一个五年计划时期中，私营工业应当发挥原有设备的一切潜力，为完成第一个五年计划而努力。李贻赞提出加工订货的工厂应当努力节约原材料。他说：“目前私营工业中有的人不愿试制新产品是不对的，这是唯利是图的思想反映，应该扭转。只有为国民经济服务，才对实现五年计划有好处。”
　  天津广大工人节约热情高涨
    据新华社天津八日电　国务院副总理李富春在全国人民代表大会会议上所作的“关于发展国民经济的第一个五年计划的报告”，鼓舞了天津市广大工人进一步开展全面节约的热情。
