　　Flood Prevention Preparations in Hubei Province
　　By our reporter Gu Weijin

　　Last year, after the Party and government leading organs of Hubei Province led the people to overcome a flood unseen in a century, they led the people in carrying out a massive project of closing breaches and restoring dikes along the more than 8,000 kilometers of main and branch dikes throughout the province. By the beginning of June this year, this project had been completed, with the total amount of work equivalent to the total amount of dike repair work in the past four years (1951 to 1954). Generally, the dikes have been restored to their original state before last year's flood, and key dikes have undergone important measures such as heightening and thickening, trenching and rebuilding, filling ponds to strengthen the foundations, and throwing stones to protect the feet of the dikes. The flood prevention capacity of the dikes has been strengthened compared to the past.
    However, at present, many staff members, including some leading staff members, have a paralyzing sense of complacency and a psychology of luck regarding this year's flood prevention. They believe: "The dikes have been renovated, the dikes are high and large, and the quality of the dikes has been strengthened, so there is no problem in blocking the flood." "Last year there was a major flood unseen in a century, and there will be no major flood this year."
    This kind of thinking is extremely harmful, as it will make people lose their vigilance and neglect prevention. The Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Hubei Provincial People's Committee, at the recent provincial flood prevention conference, seriously corrected this erroneous thinking of the staff members based on the instructions on flood prevention work from the Central Flood Prevention Headquarters. The conference first guided the staff members to inspect this year's dike projects based on the facts that some areas in previous years had suffered losses due to paralysis and carelessness in flood prevention. During the inspection, it was found that many dike sections still had weaknesses. Many dike sections were repaired during the frequent rain and snow in the winter and spring of last year and this year, and the quality of some dike projects did not meet the standards. For example, the consolidation project of the Yangtze River main dike in the Sixth District of Hanyang was rushed during the freezing period, and the soil material had a large water content, and some dike sections had cracks or collapses on the dike slopes. In many areas, due to the large task of closing breaches and restoring dikes last year, the cone penetration work of the dikes was not carried out universally, and hidden dangers in the dikes still seriously exist. For example, the Jingzhou Special District found more than 40 hidden dangers in the dikes. These facts aroused the high vigilance of the staff members, who unanimously felt that it would be difficult to overcome the flood if these weaknesses of the dikes were not overcome. Then, the conference guided the staff members to discuss whether major floods would not occur this year after the major flood last year. According to historical records, there have been cases of the Yangtze River and Han River experiencing relatively large floods for several consecutive years. For example, the floods in the Han River in 1937 and 1938 were both above the guaranteed water level, and the Yangtze River experienced relatively large floods in 1948 and 1949. Based on these historical facts, everyone felt that there was no reason to conclude that a major flood would not occur this year.
    The conference then arranged the flood prevention preparation work, determined the flood prevention standards for each dike section; determined that a comprehensive inspection, general survey, and key cone penetration should be carried out on the dikes before the flood season; required all localities to hold technical seminars to improve the flood prevention and rescue technology of the masses; established flood prevention headquarters at all levels and flood prevention organizations of the masses; and prepared flood prevention materials, etc.
    Now, the areas along the Yangtze River, the rivers, and the lakes in Hubei Province are starting to carry out flood prevention preparation work based on the spirit of the provincial flood prevention conference. Under the unified leadership of the Wuhan Municipal Flood Prevention Headquarters, ten flood prevention headquarters have been established in sections. The heads of the municipal flood prevention headquarters and the flood prevention headquarters of each section have inspected the elevation and quality of the dikes in the city. According to the inspection results, it was decided that the city's dikes should prepare 400,000 cubic meters of reserve soil (200,000 cubic meters have already been prepared) to ensure the completion of the reinforcement project before the flood season. Flood prevention headquarters have been established in all special districts and counties. The flood prevention headquarters of Jingzhou, Huanggang, and Xiaogan special districts have sent working groups to various counties to inspect the flood resistance capacity of the dikes and flood prevention preparation work. In order to do a good job in dike reinforcement projects before the flood season, each county has generally prepared more than 100,000 cubic meters of reserve soil. Qichun County has completed more than 50,000 cubic meters of dike reinforcement project. The counties along the Yangtze River and Han River in Xiaogan Special District are actively preparing flood prevention materials such as grass bags, boulders, sand, straw, and wooden stakes, and have also signed supply contracts for kerosene and lead wire with local commercial departments and supply and marketing cooperatives. Flood prevention materials stored by the masses are also being registered.
    In order to improve the flood prevention and rescue technology of the masses, the Han River Repair and Prevention Office of Jingzhou Special District recently held a flood prevention technical conference to exchange dike rescue experience over the past few years. In summarizing the flood prevention and rescue experience, the counties in Xiaogan Special District criticized the erroneous practices of using boats to protect the dikes and driving piles for rescue last year (high cost and small effect), and affirmed some correct practices. The counties along the Yangtze River and Han River have begun to train flood prevention technicians, targeting rural staff members. Jianli County has trained 270 flood prevention technicians.
    At present, although the flood prevention preparation work in the province has already begun, some counties are still not paying close attention and the work is weak and ineffective. The provincial flood prevention headquarters must urge the Party and government leading organs of these counties to raise their vigilance and quickly do a good job in flood prevention preparation work.

### 湖北省的防汛准备工作

　　湖北省的防汛准备工作
　　本报记者　古维进
    去年，湖北省党政领导机关领导人民战胜了百年少有的洪水以后，又领导人民在全省八千多公里的主要干支堤防线上进行了规模巨大的堵口复堤工程。到今年六月上旬为止，这一工程已经完工，工程总量相当于过去四年（一九五一至一九五四年）修堤工程量的总和。一般堤防都恢复了去年汛前原状，重点堤防进行了加高培厚，抽槽翻筑，填塘固基，抛石护脚等重要措施。堤防的防汛力量是比过去加强了。
    但是，目前有不少工作人员，包括部分领导工作人员在内，对于今年的防汛有麻痹自满思想和侥幸心理。他们认为：“堤防经过整修，堤身高大，堤质加强，挡住洪水没有问题了。”“去年发生了百年少有的大水，今年不会再发大水了。”
    这种思想是极端有害的，它会使人们失掉警惕疏于防患。中共湖北省委和湖北省人民委员会在最近的全省防汛会议上，根据中央防汛总指挥部的防汛工作指示，认真纠正了工作人员的这种错误思想。会议首先根据往年某些地区因为对防汛麻痹大意而造成损失的事实，引导工作人员检查今年的堤防工程。在检查中，发现不少堤段还有弱点。许多堤段是在去冬今春雨雪频繁时期修复的，堤防工程质量有的不合标准。如汉阳六区长江干堤的培修工程，是在上冻时期赶修的，土料含水量很大，有的堤段堤坡已经裂缝或塌陷。不少地区，由于去年堵口复堤任务很大，堤防的锥探工作没有普遍进行，堤身隐患依然严重存在。如荆州专区就发现堤身隐患四十多处。这些事实，引起了工作人员的高度警惕，一致感到堤防的这些弱点如果不克服，要想战胜洪水是困难的。接着，会议引导工作人员讨论去年发生大水之后，今年是否就不发生大水。根据历史记载，长江、汉水连续几年发生较大洪水的事实是有过的。如汉水一九三七、一九三八年的洪水都在保证水位以上，长江在一九四八、一九四九年都发生较大的洪水。根据这些历史事实，大家觉得没有理由断定今年不会发生大洪水。
    会议接着布置了防汛准备工作，确定了各堤段的防汛标准；确定汛前对堤防进行一次全面性的检查、普测和重点锥探；要求各地召开技术座谈会，提高群众的防汛抢险技术；建立各级防汛指挥部和群众的防汛组织及准备防汛器材等。
    现在湖北省沿江、沿河、沿湖地区，正在根据省防汛会议的精神，开始进行防汛准备工作。武汉市在市防汛总指挥部统一领导下，分段设立了十个防汛指挥部。市防汛总指挥部和各段防汛指挥部负责人，已经分别对全市堤防的标高、质量作了检查。根据检查结果，决定全市堤防准备预备土四十万公方（现在已经准备了二十万公方），保证在汛前完成加固工程。各专区、县都成立了防汛指挥部。荆州、黄冈、孝感专区防汛指挥部都派出工作组分赴各县检查堤防抗洪能力和防汛准备工作。各县为了做好汛前的堤防加固工程，一般都准备了预备土十多万公方。蕲春县已经完成了五万多公方的堤身加固工程。孝感专区沿长江、汉水各县，积极准备草包、蛮石、砂子、稻草、木桩等防汛器材，同时还同各地商业部门、供销合作社订立了煤油、铅丝的供应合同。群众自存的防汛器材也在登记中。
    为了提高群众的防汛抢险技术，荆州专区汉江修防处最近召开了防汛技术会议，交流了几年来堤防抢险经验。孝感专区各县在总结防汛抢险经验中，批判了去年打船护堤、打桩抢险等错误作法（费用大，作用小），肯定了一些正确的作法。沿长江、汉水各县已开始以乡村工作人员为对象，训练防汛技术人员。监利县已训练防汛技术人员二百七十人。
    目前全省的防汛准备工作虽然已经开始，但仍然有一些县抓得不紧，工作软弱无力。省防汛总指挥部必须督促这些县的党政领导机关提高警惕，迅速作好防汛准备工作。
