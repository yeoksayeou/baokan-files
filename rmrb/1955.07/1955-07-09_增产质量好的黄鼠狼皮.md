　　Increase Production of High-Quality Yellow Weasel Pelts
    Jiang Hanjie

　　The yellow weasel is a wild animal found in Northeast China, North China, East China, and Central China, with the best quality coming from the Northeast. Its fur is soft and thick, and the pelt is flexible. After tanning and dyeing, it can be used for women's clothing and ornaments. Its tail hair is a raw material for making brushes. Oil painting brushes and China's famous wolf hair brushes are made from the tips of yellow weasel tail hair.

　　Yellow weasel pelts are one of China's major export commodities, with a history of more than eighty years of export. After liberation, the annual export of yellow weasel pelts can be exchanged for about 35,300 metric tons of fertilizer, 40,000 metric tons of gasoline, or 617 combine harvesters. Exporting yellow weasel pelts plays a significant role in the country's industrialization and can also increase the income of farmers and hunters.

　　However, because some hunters do not follow the hunting season and hunt blindly, and the hunting tools are very outdated, many inferior-quality pelts are produced each year, accounting for more than 40 percent of the total output, which urgently needs to be improved.

　　After the beginning of winter each year, it is the season when the yellow weasel's fur grows best. At this time, the yellow weasel's hair tips are firm and smooth, the underfur is thick, and the pelt is white, making it a first-class pelt. In autumn, the hair is sparse and the underfur is empty, and the pelt is blue-black, making it a second or third-class pelt or an off-grade inferior pelt. Every spring, the hair tips are messy, and the pelt is red and smelly, which does not meet the export specifications; moreover, the female weasels are all pregnant. If weasels are hunted in the spring, it will affect the output for the following year.

　　In order to improve the quality of yellow weasel pelts and ensure exports, animal product companies should conduct education and technical guidance for hunters, supply and marketing cooperatives, and rural private merchants during the off-season. It is necessary to introduce new hunting tools to hunters, and clearly explain the samples and prices of pelts collected in each season to the hunters. It is necessary to introduce good hunting experiences to them, so that they understand the economic value of yellow weasel pelts and their role in the country's industrialization, as well as the benefits of hunting according to the season.

　  增产质量好的黄鼠狼皮
    蒋汉杰
    黄鼠狼是一种野生动物，出产在我国东北、华北、华东、华中等地，以东北所产的品质最好。它的皮软毛浓，皮版柔韧，经过硝熟染色可做女装衣饰。它的尾巴毛是制笔的原料，油画笔和我国著名的狼毫笔，都是用黄鼠狼尾巴的毛尖做成的。
    黄鼠狼皮是我国主要出口物资之一，输出国外已有八十多年的历史。解放后每年输出国外的黄鼠狼皮约可换回肥田粉三万五千三百公吨，或汽油四万公吨，或联合收割机六百一十七部。输出黄鼠狼皮，对国家工业化有很大作用，同时可以增加农民和猎民的收入。
    但是，由于有些猎民没有按照打猎季节而盲目猎捉，打狼工具又很落后，每年所产的次毛皮很多，约占总产量的百分之四十以上，这是急需改进的。
    每年立冬以后，是黄鼠狼毛皮生长得最好的季节，这时黄鼠狼的毛尖挺润、底绒丰厚、皮版洁白，是头等毛皮。在秋季，毛稀绒空、版色青黑，是二、三等皮或等级以外的次皮。每年春季，毛尖凌乱、皮版发红发臭，不符合外销规格；而且母狼都已怀孕，如果在春季打狼，就会影响下年度的产量。
    为了提高黄鼠狼皮的质量，保证出口，畜产公司应该在淡季向猎民和供销合作社以及农村私商收购人员进行教育和技术指导。要向猎民介绍新的打狼工具，将每个季节猎取的皮张样品、价格等向猎民交代清楚，要向他们介绍好的打狼经验，使他们明白黄鼠狼皮的经济价值和对国家工业化的作用，以及按季节猎取的好处。
