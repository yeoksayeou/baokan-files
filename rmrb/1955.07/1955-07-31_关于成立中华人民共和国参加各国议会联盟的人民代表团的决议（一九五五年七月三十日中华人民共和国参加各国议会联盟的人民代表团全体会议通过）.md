    关于成立中华人民共和国参加各国议会联盟的人民代表团的决议
    （一九五五年七月三十日中华人民共和国参加各国议会联盟的人民代表团全体会议通过）
    中华人民共和国全国人民代表大会常务委员会曾在一九五五年二月十二日决议中指出：各国议会应该担负起维护和巩固世界和平的重大责任，采取具体步骤发展各国人民的友好合作关系，并互派代表团进行访问，为加强国际和平而努力。
    我们全国人民代表大会代表一千零九十人研究了各国议会联盟的章程，认为它的宗旨是有利于增进世界各国议会议员间的广泛接触，发展各国人民间的友好合作，促进世界各国的和平共处，巩固和发展民主事业的。因此，一致决议组成“中华人民共和国参加各国议会联盟的人民代表团”，加入各国议会联盟。
