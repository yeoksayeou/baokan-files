　　Responses to Criticism and Suggestions
　　After the People's Daily "Letters from Readers" page published two letters on May 1st titled "Leadership over Oil-Tea Production Should Be Strengthened in Parts of Guangxi and Hunan," the Forestry Departments of Guangxi and Hunan provinces have each written back, expressing their acceptance of the readers' opinions and adopting concrete measures to strengthen leadership over oil-tea production.

    The People's Daily "Letters from Readers" page criticized "Many Counties and Districts in Guangxi Neglect Afforestation Work" on May 9th. Now, the Guangxi Provincial Forestry Department has written back saying that it has reviewed the shortcomings in the leadership of this year's spring afforestation and seedling cultivation work, and expressed its determination to complete this year's afforestation and seedling cultivation plan.

    The Preparatory Office of the State-owned Beijing No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory writes: The facts revealed in the article "'Completion' of the Plan Caused Confusion" in the People's Daily "Letters from Readers" page on June 12th are correct. The test run plan we formulated was not practical, and the "rushing" method used at the end of the month to complete the plan resulted in serious confusion in certain processes of the workshop. We have checked this incident, formulated methods, and improved future work.

    In the letter "The 'Trick' to Finding Workers" by Comrade Ding Yun published in the "Letters from Readers" page on June 12th, it was pointed out that Shanghai Boiler Factory and the companies under the Harbin Public Utilities Bureau took erroneous measures such as "exchanging workers," "borrowing workers," and "compensatory leave in exchange for rest" to work overtime in disguised forms in order to rush tasks. The Shanghai Boiler Factory wrote back, admitting that this method of completing tasks was incorrect and has formulated a system to prevent it. The Harbin Public Utilities Bureau has also instructed its affiliated companies to immediately stop this practice.

    The China Federation of Literary and Art Circles writes: The suggestion made by Comrade Wang Zhiling (formerly mistakenly written as Ding Zhiling) published in the People's Daily "Letters from Readers" page on May 22nd is very good; the diverse activities of the Soviet literary and art circles in connecting with the masses are worth our reference. We have now forwarded this suggestion to the relevant organizations.

    The Editorial Department of the Beijing Film Script Creation Institute writes: The suggestion made by Comrade Lu Ling in the "Letters from Readers" page that "the Zhuang people yearn for films reflecting their lives" is worthy of our attention. Currently, we are considering writing such scripts, and some people have proposed going deep into the lives of the Zhuang people to create. We estimate that the creation of this script cannot be completed in a short time. Therefore, in addition to actively encouraging screenwriters to carry out this creation, we also hope and welcome Zhuang comrades who love movies to create based on their familiar lives and materials, and they can contact us in the creation process, and we will do our best to help. Carrying out the work separately in this way can enable films reflecting the lives of the Zhuang people to be completed sooner.

    Reader Guo Zhi's letter reflects that the several lime kilns of the Beishan Stone Factory, which belongs to the Kailuan Coal Mine General Administration, are located near the workers' dormitories of the Zhaogezhuang Kailuan Coal Mine in the Dongkuang District of Tangshan City. These kilns emit coal smoke, affecting the health of the nearby residents and their families. The local government has requested the removal of the kilns, but to no effect.
    We forwarded the reader's comments to the Kailuan Coal Mine General Administration. The Basic Construction Bureau of the Kailuan Coal Mine General Administration replied on June 6th that the kiln relocation plan has been approved by higher authorities, and after the civil engineering company prepares the kiln relocation construction budget and submits it to the Tangshan City Urban Construction Committee for approval, the kiln can be relocated in the third quarter.

    Reader Ouyang Zhusun criticized the localism of the Nanchang Office of the Jiangxi Forest Industry Bureau when transferring workers in a letter in April. According to the inspection and reply from the Jiangxi Forest Industry Bureau, the Nanchang Office did indeed have some localism in the transfer of workers. For example, when the Nanchang Office transferred the Tujiapu Transfer Station to the Wucheng Lumberyard in February this year, it used the excuse of inspecting flood control work to transfer some active young workers from the Tujiapu Transfer Station and assign them to their affiliated Jing'an Work Station. Now the Nanchang Office has recognized its mistakes and is determined to correct this localist approach in future work.

专栏：批评建议的反应

　　批评建议的反应
    五月一日人民日报“读者来信专页”发表了以
  “广西、湖南部分地区应该加强对油茶生产的领导”为题的两封读者来信后，广西、湖南两省的林业厅已分别来信，表示接受读者的意见，并采取了具体措施加强对油茶生产的领导。

    五月九日人民日报“读者来信专页”曾批评
  “广西许多县区忽视造林工作”。现在，广西省林业厅来信说对今年春季造林育苗的领导工作中的缺点已作了检查，并表示要争取完成今年的造林育苗计划。

    国营北京第二棉纺织厂筹建处来信：六月十二日人民日报“读者来信专页”中“‘完成’了计划造成了混乱”一稿所揭发的事实是正确的。我们制定的试车计划不切合实际，而在月底用“赶”的办法来完成计划，结果造成了车间某些工序的严重混乱现象。我们已通过检查这次事例，订出办法，改进今后工作。
                ×××
    六月十二日“读者来信专页”所刊丁云同志“找工人的‘窍门’”一信中，指出上海锅炉厂和哈尔滨公用事业管理局所属各公司为了赶任务而采取
  “换工借工”、“补休换休”等变相加班加点的错误做法。上海锅炉厂来信，承认这种完成任务的方法是不正确的，并已订出制度加以防止。哈尔滨公用事业管理局也已责成所属各公司立即制止这种做法。
                ×××
    中国文学艺术界联合会来信：五月二十二日人民日报“读者来信专页”发表王志玲同志（前误为丁志玲）的建议是很好的；苏联文艺界联系群众的多种多样的活动，值得我们参考。现在，我们已将这个建议转告各有关团体。
                ×××
    北京电影剧本创作所编辑部来信：“读者来信专页”发表鲁玲同志提出僮族人民渴望有反映自己生活的影片”的建议，很值得我们重视。目前，我们正在考虑编写这类剧本，并有人提出了深入僮族人民生活进行创作的计划。我们估计这个剧本的创作工作不可能在短时间内完成。所以我们除了积极鼓励编剧工作者进行这一创作外，并希望和欢迎僮族爱好电影的同志根据自己所熟悉的生活和材料进行创作，在创作中可同我们联系，我们将尽力帮助。这样分头进行，可以使反映僮族人民生活的影片早日完成。

    读者国治来信反映：开滦煤矿总管理处所属北山石厂的几座石灰窑，设在唐山市东矿区赵各庄开滦煤矿的工人宿舍附近。这几座窑煤烟纷飞，影响了附近居住的职工及其家属的健康。当地政府曾要求把窑迁走，但是一直没有效果。
    我们把读者意见转告了开滦煤矿总管理处。开滦煤矿总管理处基本建设局已在六月六日答复说：迁窑计划已经上级批准，等土建公司作好迁窑施工预算并报请唐山市城市建设委员会批准后，在第三季度就可把窑迁走。

    读者欧阳竹荪在四月份来信批评江西森林工业局南昌办事处调动工人时的本位主义做法。据江西森林工业局检查答复，南昌办事处在调动工人时确实有些本位主义。如今年二月南昌办事处把涂家埠转运站移交吴城贮木场时，就用检查防洪工作为借口，从涂家埠转运站调出一些工作积极的青年工人，分配到他们所属的靖安作业所去。现在南昌办事处已认识了自己的错误，决心在今后工作中改正这种本位主义的做法。
