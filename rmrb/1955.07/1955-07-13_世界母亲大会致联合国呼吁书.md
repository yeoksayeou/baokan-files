The World Mothers' Congress for the Protection of Children from War, for the Achievement of Disarmament and Friendship among All Peoples, held in Lausanne from July 7th to 10th, 1955, appeals to the United Nations Organization, which recently celebrated its tenth anniversary in a spirit of harmony. The Congress represents millions of mothers in sixty-six countries, expressing their hopes and also their concerns.

At this Congress, mothers from various countries who had suffered the disasters of the last world war met with mothers from countries whose war wounds were still fresh. They met the mothers of Japan, whose children were doomed to chronic death due to the radiation from the atomic bomb explosions; they met the mothers of colonial and semi-colonial countries, where exploitation and repression threatened the lives of children and shattered the people's hopes for a higher civilization.

Mothers are deeply concerned about war preparations and the arms race, which devour vast resources, sacrifice the well-being of families, especially children, and often lead to hunger and poverty.

In the face of the new, more terrible danger of atomic war, which threatens to destroy millions upon millions of families, mothers are deeply concerned about the lives of their children.

Children face life with a smile, and they have the right to grow up in happiness. Therefore, mothers appeal to the United Nations Organization, which they have been following with great interest. They hope that the United Nations Organization will completely fulfill the task it undertook at its founding – to protect the rising generation from war.

Mothers are excited to learn of the recent unanimous vote on disarmament and the peaceful use of atomic energy, which has instilled great hope in the hearts of women.

With all the strength of maternal love, we demand:

	The cessation of all war preparations;
	Supervised, gradual reduction of armaments as the beginning of universal disarmament;
	The prohibition and destruction of atomic weapons and all weapons of mass destruction;
	The peaceful use of atomic energy.

Mothers demand that the right of people to control their own destiny be respected, and condemn any interference in the internal affairs of other countries.

They demand that all international disputes be resolved through negotiation.

These measures will ensure that the lives of children are protected, create the necessary conditions for their all-round development, and enable mothers to have the opportunity to live happy lives.

Mothers all over the world enthusiastically support any initiatives and efforts made by the United Nations to achieve these goals.

    世界母亲大会致联合国呼吁书
    一九五五年七月七日到十日在洛桑举行的世界母亲保卫儿童免遭战争、争取实现裁军和各国人民友好大会向不久以前本着和睦精神纪念成立十周年的联合国组织呼吁。大会代表六十六个国家的千百万母亲，在这里表示她们的希望，同时也表示她们的忧虑。
    在这次大会上，经受上次世界大战灾难的各国母亲会晤了战争创伤犹新的国家的母亲。她们会晤了日本的母亲，这些日本母亲的孩子由于原子弹爆炸的放射作用而注定要慢性死亡；她们会晤了殖民地和半殖民地国家的母亲，在那里，剥削和镇压使孩子们的生活受到威胁，并且使人民要求更高的文明的希望成为泡影。
    母亲们为战争准备和军备竞赛深感忧虑，战争准备和军备竞赛吞掉大量资源，而牺牲家庭、首先是儿童的幸福，并且常常导向饥饿和贫穷。
    在新的、更加可怕的、威胁着毁灭千千万万家庭的原子战争的危险面前，母亲们为孩子们的生命深深担忧。
    孩子们含着微笑迎向生活，他们有权利在幸福中成长。因此，母亲们要向联合国组织发出呼吁，她们一直关心地注视着这个组织的工作。她们希望联合国组织彻底完成它在创立时所承担的任务——保卫正在成长的一代免遭战争。
    母亲们兴奋地获悉最近就裁军及和平利用原子能问题举行的一致赞同的表决结果，这次表决给妇女们的心中注入了莫大的希望。
    我们以母爱的全部力量要求：
    停止各种战争准备；
    有监督地、逐步地裁减军备，作为普遍裁军的开端；
    禁止和销毁原子武器和各种大规模毁灭性武器；
    和平利用原子能。
    母亲们要求人民自己掌握自己命运的权利得到尊重，并且谴责对别国内政的任何干涉。
    她们要求，以谈判方式解决一切国际争端。
    这些措施将可以保证儿童的生命得到保护，为他们的全面发展创造必要的条件，使母亲们有机会过幸福的生活。
    全世界母亲热烈支持联合国为达到这些目的而作的任何倡议和任何努力。
