Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, July 3rd. The Indonesian "People's Daily" reported on the 2nd that Lukman, the First Deputy General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Indonesian Communist Party, issued a statement on the tensions in the Indonesian Army arising from the opposition of the suspended Acting Army Chief of Staff, Lubis, to the appointment of Udojo as Army Chief of Staff.

The statement said that the current tensions in the Indonesian Army should be resolved through peaceful means, which is the best way to maintain the unity of the army.

The statement said that the purpose of army unity is to defend the Republic from the danger of a possible Dutch attack, especially at a time when relations between Indonesia and the Netherlands have recently become increasingly strained. The statement said that since unity has a clear objective, it does not mean "unity" between patriots and traitors or between republicans and anti-republicans. The statement said that this point must be emphasized because since October 17, 1952, the anti-republican elements in the army have been trying to take some kind of anti-democratic action by force, for example, attempting to dissolve the parliament and cabinet through armed pressure and pressure on the president.

The statement said that the National Army of the Republic of Indonesia was born in the democratic national revolution, and therefore its duty is to defend democracy and not to oppose democracy. The statement said that disobedience to orders, violation of discipline, and betrayal of the democratic government are not expressions of democracy, but symbols of fascism. The statement said that the appointment of the new Army Chief of Staff is democratic and constitutional. The statement pointed out that the Yogyakarta Charter requires the army to unite and obey the government. This is precisely what those who disobey orders have failed to do. The statement demanded that the suspended Acting Army Chief of Staff abandon his intention to oppose the appointment of Udojo as Army Chief of Staff.

The statement called on the Indonesian government to continue its efforts to deal with anti-republican actions. The statement also called on the government to take resolute measures against those who try to fish in troubled waters, especially those who try to launch another "October 17th Incident." The statement called on the officers and soldiers of the Indonesian Army to be loyal to the government and the people, and called on all Indonesian people to support the government's efforts to resolve this issue.

　　就目前印度尼西亚陆军中的紧张局势问题
　　印度尼西亚共产党第一副总书记发表声明
    新华社雅加达三日电　印度尼西亚“人民日报”二日报道，印度尼西亚共产党中央委员会第一副总书记鲁克曼就印度尼西亚陆军中由于已被停职的代理陆军参谋长卢比斯反对任命乌多约为陆军参谋长而产生的紧张局势发表声明。
    声明说，印度尼西亚陆军中目前的紧张局势应该通过和平的方法来解决，这是保持军队团结的最好的方法。
    声明说，军队团结的目的在于保卫共和国免受荷兰可能的进攻的危险，特别是正当印度尼西亚和荷兰的关系最近愈来愈紧张的时候。声明说，由于团结具有明显的目标，因此，这并不意味着爱国者和卖国贼之间或共和国分子和反对共和国分子之间的“团结”。声明说，这一点是必须强调指出的，因为自从一九五二年十月十七日以来，军队中的反对共和国分子一直在设法用强力采取某种反民主的行动，例如，企图通过武装压力和对总统施行压力，来解散国会和内阁。
    声明说，印度尼西亚共和国的国民军是在民主国民革命中诞生的，因此，它的职责是保卫民主而不是反对民主。声明说，不服从命令、违反纪律和背叛民主政府的行为，不是民主的表现，而是法西斯的象征。声明说，新陆军参谋长的任命是民主的，是合乎宪法的。声明指出，日惹宪章要求陆军团结和服从政府。而这恰恰是那些不服从命令的人所没有做到的事。声明要求已被停职的代理陆军参谋长放弃他反对任命乌多约为陆军参谋长的意图。
    声明要求印度尼西亚政府继续努力应付反对共和国的行动。声明并要求政府对那些企图混水摸鱼、特别是企图发动另一次“十月十七日事件”的人，采取坚决的措施。声明号召印度尼西亚陆军的军官和士兵忠诚于政府和人民，号召全体印度尼西亚人民支持政府解决这个问题的努力。
