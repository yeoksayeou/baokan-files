The Beijing Zoo will begin exhibiting the giant panda, China's most treasured and world-renowned animal, starting July 2nd. The Beijing Zoo has exhibited a red panda since 1954, which has been very popular with visitors. However, the giant panda is even more precious, so the zoo sent a working team to the Sichuan-Xikang area in the winter of 1954 to collect giant pandas. By the end of March this year, three pandas had been collected and were airlifted to Beijing on June 5th. These three giant pandas are all cubs under one year old and were all born in Baoxing County, Xikang Province. Because the climate in Beijing is much hotter than in the mountains of Xikang, and these animals are still young, they need to be quarantined for a period of time. The Beijing Zoo has decided to first publicly exhibit the largest of these, a male, starting on July 2nd. The other two smaller pandas will be exhibited successively when their health conditions permit.

　　北京动物园今日起展览大熊猫
    从七月二日起，北京动物园开始展出我国最珍贵的特产动物——世界闻名的大熊猫。北京动物园自一九五四年起曾展出一种小熊猫，很受观众的欢迎。但是更珍贵的是大熊猫，所以该园在一九五四年冬天又派出工作队到四川西康一带去搜集大熊猫。到今年三月底，已先后收集到三只，并已于六月五日空运到北京。这三只大熊猫都是年不及一周岁的幼兽，都产自西康省宝兴县。因为北京的气候比西康山上热得多，这几只动物又还年幼，所以需要把它们隔离一个时期。北京动物园决定自七月二日起首先把其中较大的一只公开展览，另外两只小的，等到健康条件允许时，也将陆续展出。
