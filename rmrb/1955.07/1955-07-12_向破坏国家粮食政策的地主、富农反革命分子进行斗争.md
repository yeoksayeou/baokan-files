    Struggle Against Landlords, Rich Peasants, and Counter-Revolutionary Elements Sabotaging National Grain Policy

    Recently, in the course of rectifying grain unified purchase and sales work in various places, many facts have been revealed about landlords, rich peasants, and counter-revolutionary elements sabotaging the national grain purchase and sales policy. These facts show that the sabotage activities of these bad elements are one of the important reasons for the tense grain supply situation this spring. To further improve grain unified purchase and sales work, we must wage unremitting struggles against these bad elements.
    According to materials revealed by local newspapers, the activities of landlords, rich peasants, and counter-revolutionary elements in sabotaging the grain policy are multifaceted. Creating an atmosphere of grain shortage and inciting peasants to make trouble for the government regarding supplies is one aspect of the sabotage of the national grain policy by landlords, rich peasants, and counter-revolutionary elements. After the unified sales work began this year, Huang Xianhong, a rich peasant in Fuwan Township, Gucheng County, Hubei Province, systematically carried out sabotage. He first clamored that there was not enough grain to eat, and made trouble for the township staff every day for supplies, while inciting others to do the same. For example, he said to Zhu Chaozhu, a member of the Shuangnian Agricultural Cooperative: "If you don't get some grain coupons now, you will starve to death when others have taken them all!" He tricked Zhu Chaozhu into going to the government every day to demand grain coupons. Farmer Zhou Xuerang, because he was not short of grain, could not get grain coupons and was somewhat dissatisfied with the government, so he went to instigate:
  "You can't get them even if you want them, I can never finish eating, so I'll just give you some." He sat in the teahouse every day, using methods such as giving away cigarettes and paying for tea to lure farmers, encouraging them to make trouble for supplies. Under his instigation and enticement, the number of farmers in this village making trouble for supplies quickly increased from two households to thirty-two households, and these thirty-two households were actually not short of grain. Liu Lin, a bad element in Mofan Township, Qianshan County, Anhui Province, openly incited the masses at a mass meeting, saying: "Hundreds of households in the township have requested supplies, they want us to want them too, whoever doesn't want them means the unified purchase is not thorough. Everyone go and ask for them, the government won't be able to refuse." Under his instigation, many farmers, fearing that they would be accused of not thoroughly selling surplus grain, deliberately said they were short of grain. Activist Xie Yunqing, fearing ridicule and isolation, defiantly ate half a liter of rice more each day and also said he was short of grain.
    Hoarding and reselling state grain for speculation and profiteering is another aspect of the sabotage of the grain policy by landlords and rich peasants in collusion with unscrupulous merchants. In Langjiayingzi Village, Chifeng Township, Rehe Province, one landlord and two rich peasant households colluded with some farmers to secretly engage in grain speculation, buying and selling more than 95,000 catties of grain in a few months, from which they profited more than 500 yuan. Liu Xiangzhong, an unscrupulous merchant in Fenshui Town, Sixth District, Hanchuan County, Hubei Province, traveled between disaster areas and non-disaster areas from February to April this year, colluding with local landlords and rich peasant elements to engage in grain speculation. When he went to non-disaster areas, he deceived local farmers, saying: "We are from the agricultural production cooperative in the disaster area. The government supplies too little grain, not enough to eat. Please show some spirit of class friendship and spare some grain for us to eat." Many farmers fell for his trick and sold him 265 catties of rice and 448 catties of bean curd dregs. Liu Xiangzhong sold these grains to farmers and fishermen in disaster areas at high prices. Even after the rectification of the grain unified sales work, these lawless elements have not stopped speculating in grain; their activities have only become more covert. In Pingquan County, Rehe Province alone, three organized grain trafficking groups have recently been discovered, engaging in grain speculation between Chengde, Lingyuan, and Ningcheng.
    In order to achieve the purpose of hoarding and reselling state grain, landlords, rich peasants, and counter-revolutionary elements have adopted all kinds of methods. One method is to pretend to be poor and miserable, loudly claiming a shortage of grain. In Dongyingzi Village, Eighth District, Chengde County, Rehe Province, a bad element named Wang Jinhe, who had just purchased grain last year, clamored in the village: "This year's grain purchase was too harsh, and even my rations were purchased." This year, as soon as February arrived, he went to the local government again and again to request grain supplies. His mother also went to the village chief's house crying and said: "Our family doesn't even have a little grain left. If the government doesn't supply us, the whole family will starve to death!" When it came time to plant, Wang Jinhe cried even louder about the lack of grain, saying that if the government did not supply grain, he would not plant the land and would flee to other places to escape famine. Some days, the chimney of his house could not be seen smoking at noon. His mother
  begged for food from house to house with her child in her arms at mealtimes. A staff member from the district named Wang came to the village, and he went to him three times a day to request supplies. The staff member surnamed Wang thought of going to his house to see the truth. As soon as he entered the door, he happened to catch his family eating dinner. Seeing it, it was indeed as if there was no grain to eat: they were eating rice steamed with elm tree buds and soybean flour, and the sorghum residue porridge was so thin that you could see people through it. Wang Jinhe asked with tears in his eyes: "Comrade Wang, you see, please think of a way for us, there is no grain left at home." The staff member surnamed Wang, seeing this situation, thought that his family really had no grain, and discussed with the village staff to give him a supply certificate for 400 catties of grain. What was the actual situation? According to the masses' exposure, this Wang Jinhe not only was not short of grain, but also secretly hoarded a large amount of grain. He had been secretly buying grain everywhere since last spring. He always took the donkey to remote mountain gullies to graze during the day, and transported the grain back at midnight. During the year, he transported back a total of 5,282 catties of various grains, plus the 5,440 catties of grain he harvested last year, for a total of 10,722 catties of grain secretly hoarded. Last autumn, he only sold 1,500 catties to the state and paid 1,000 catties in agricultural tax, leaving 8,222 catties. His family of six, plus two cattle and one donkey, needed a total of 500 catties of feed for the cattle and donkeys, leaving 7,722 catties, which, when divided equally among the population, amounted to more than 1,200 catties of grain per person per year. The average consumption in rural areas is calculated at 365 catties per person per year, so each person in his family had the equivalent of more than three people's worth of grain. Yet he pretended to be poor so realistically! Another method is to defraud farmers of their grain purchase certificates or alter the grain purchase certificates to resell state grain. Zhu Hongyi, a landlord in Guizhu County, Guizhou Province, defrauded Zhu Guiqing, a farmer, of a grain purchase certificate in November 1954, and privately altered it to a livestock grain purchase certificate for five horses, purchasing eight catties of corn per horse per day. From November last year to April this year, he resold more than 1,200 catties of corn. This Zhu Hongyi not only resold the grain himself, but also instigated thirteen farmers to alter their grain purchase certificates to resell corn in Guiyang City. In a few months, they resold more than 45,000 catties of corn. Still another method is to use sweet words, treat guests, and give gifts to lure rural staff members into defrauding grain purchase certificates. Yin Dexue, a bad element in Wudan County, Rehe Province, treated the village chief Yan Fengxi to a meal and defrauded him of a grain purchase certificate for 2,400 catties of grain. These reactionary elements can use any despicable means to sabotage the country's grain policy.
    From the examples revealed above, we can see that the sabotage activities of landlords, rich peasants, and counter-revolutionary elements are diametrically opposed to the country's grain policy. When the state wants to purchase surplus grain and control grain, they hoard the grain and even resell the grain that the state has already taken into its possession; when the state wants to ban the free market for grain and maintain price stability, they collude with unscrupulous merchants to engage in the grain black market and speculate in grain, raising grain prices; when the state wants to supply grain to the grain-deficient people, they incite non-grain-deficient households to make trouble with the state for supplies, causing the grain-deficient people to be dissatisfied with the Party and the government because they cannot get supplies. These acts of sabotage are by no means isolated and accidental phenomena, but a manifestation of the exploiting classes sabotaging socialist transformation. Although these criminal activities of the saboteurs have been exposed by the people in various places and punished by the governments in accordance with the law, they will not stop for a considerable period of time. In the work of further implementing the grain policy, rural staff members must be good at relying on the masses and raising the level of awareness of the masses, so as to expose and crack down on the sabotage activities of all bad elements at any time. Some people believe that after many mass movements and revolutionary struggles in rural areas, landlords and rich peasants have become honest; now that the state has implemented the policy of unified purchase and sale of grain, unscrupulous merchants and counter-revolutionary elements cannot do anything about grain. This is extremely harmful thinking that paralyzes oneself and facilitates the enemy. Only by thoroughly overcoming this paralyzing thinking can we prevent and eliminate all sabotage activities of bad elements against the grain policy.

    向破坏国家粮食政策的地主、富农反革命分子进行斗争
    蓝村
    最近各地在整顿粮食统销工作当中，揭发了不少地主、富农、反革命分子破坏粮食统购统销政策的事实。这些事实说明：这些坏分子的破坏活动，就是造成今年春季粮食供应紧张情况的重要原因之一。进一步做好粮食统购统销工作，必须同这些坏分子作不懈的斗争。
    根据各地方报纸所揭发的材料，地主、富农、反革命分子破坏粮食政策的活动是多方面的。制造缺粮紧张空气，煽动农民向政府闹供应，是地主、富农、反革命分子破坏国家粮食政策的一个方面。湖北省谷城县傅湾乡富农黄先洪在今年统销工作开始以后，就有计划地进行破坏。他首先吵嚷粮食不够吃，每天向乡工作人员闹供应，同时煽动别人去闹供应。如他对双埝农业合作社社员朱朝主说：“你现在还不搞点粮票，人家搞完了，你会饿死哩！”骗得朱朝主每天去向政府吵要粮票。农民周学让因不缺粮，要不到粮票，对政府有些不满，他就去挑唆：
  “你要也要不到，我总是吃不完，送你点算了。”他每天坐茶馆，用送纸烟、开茶钱等手段引诱农民，鼓动他们去闹供应。在他的挑唆拉拢下，这个村闹供应的农民由两户很快增加到三十二户，而这三十二户实际上都不缺粮。安徽省潜山县模范乡坏分子刘林，公开在群众大会上煽动群众说：“全乡有几百户要求供应了，他们要我们也要，谁不要就是统购不彻底。大家都去要，政府不供应就不行。”许多农民在他的煽动下，怕说卖余粮不彻底，都故意说缺粮。积极分子谢云青怕受讽刺受孤立，就赌气每天多吃半升米，也跟着说缺粮。
    抢购套购国家粮食，进行投机倒把，是地主、富农结合奸商破坏粮食政策的另一个方面。热河省赤峰乡郎家营子村一户地主、两户富农拉拢部分农民暗中做粮食投机买卖，几个月当中，即买卖粮食九万五千多斤，从中得利五百多元。湖北省汉川县第六区分水镇奸商刘香中，在今年二月到四月间，往来于灾区、非灾区，勾结当地地主、富农分子，进行粮食投机买卖。到非灾区，他就欺骗当地农民说：“我们是灾区农业生产合作社的人。政府供应粮食太少了，不够吃。请你们发挥一点阶级友爱的精神，匀一点粮食给我们吃。”不少农民上了他的当，先后卖给他大米二百六十五斤，豆皮子四百四十八斤。刘香中得到这些粮食，一转手就以高价卖给灾区的农民和渔民。就是在粮食统销工作经过整顿以后，这些不法分子对粮食的投机倒把也还没有停止，他们的活动只不过是更加隐蔽了。热河省仅平泉一县，最近就发现有组织的粮贩集团三起，往来于承德、凌源、宁城等地进行粮食投机买卖。
    为了达到抢购套购国家粮食的目的，地主、富农、反革命分子采用了各种各样的手法。一种手法是装穷叫苦、大喊缺粮。热河省承德县八区东营子村有个叫王金和的坏分子，去年刚购过粮，他就在村里吵嚷：“今年购粮购过火了，把我的口粮都购去了。”今年一进二月，他就一次又一次地找当地政府要求供应粮食。他母亲也到村长家哭着说：“我家连一点点粮食都没有啦，政府再不供应，一家大小都得饿死啦！”到种地时，王金和喊缺粮更凶了，说政府若不供应粮食，他就不种地了，到外边逃荒去。有些天，晌午也看不见他家烟囱冒烟了。他母亲
  一到吃饭的时候就抱着孩子挨家要饭吃。区里一位姓王的工作人员到村里来，他一天去找三趟，要求供应。姓王的工作人员想到他家去看看真象，一进门，正碰上他家在吃晚饭，一看，果然是没有粮食吃的样子：吃的是榆树钱和黄豆面蒸的饭，高粱渣粥稀的照得见人，一家到处摆的都是野菜。王金和又眼泪汪汪地要求起来：“王同志，您看见了吧，快点给我们想想办法吧，家里一点粮食也没有了。”王同志看了这种情景，以为他家真是没粮食了，便同村工作人员商量给了他四百斤粮食的供应证。实际情况怎样呢？经群众揭发，原来这个王金和不仅不缺粮，而且私藏了大批粮食，他从去年春天起就偷偷地四出购粮。他总是白天把毛驴拉到僻静的山沟去放，半夜里把粮食运回来。一年当中，他前后共运回各种米粮五千二百八十二斤，加上去年他打粮五千四百四十斤，共偷藏粮食一万零七百二十二斤。去年秋天他只卖给国家一千五百斤、缴农业税一千斤，还剩八千二百二十二斤。他一家大小六口人，还有二牛一驴。牛驴饲料共需五百斤，还剩七千七百二十二斤，按人口平均分配，每人一年有粮一千二百多斤。农村一般消费量每人每年以三百六十五斤计算，他家每口人等于有三个多人的粮食，然而他装穷装得多么逼真！另一种手法是骗取农民的购粮证或涂改购粮证，套购国家粮食。贵州省贵筑县地主朱鸿益，一九五四年十一月骗得农民朱桂清的购粮证一张，私自涂改为五匹马的牲畜购粮证，每匹马每天购玉米八斤，自去年十一月到今年四月，共套购玉米一千二百多斤。这个朱鸿益不仅自己套购，还唆使十三个农民涂改购粮证到贵阳市套购玉米，几个月当中共套购了玉米四万五千多斤。再一种手法是用甜言蜜语、请客送礼等办法去引诱拉拢乡村工作人员骗取购粮证。热河省乌丹县坏分子尹德学，请村长阎凤喜吃了一次饭，就骗得了一张两千四百斤粮的购粮证。这些反动分子为了破坏国家的粮食政策，是什么卑鄙的手段都可以使用出来的。
    从上面所揭发的这些事例，我们可以看到，地主、富农、反革命分子的破坏活动，同国家的粮食政策是针锋相对的。国家要统购余粮，掌握粮食，他们就把粮食囤积起来，而且把国家已经掌握到手的粮食套购了去；国家要取缔粮食的自由市场，保持物价稳定，他们就同奸商结合搞粮食黑市，进行粮食投机倒把，抬高粮价；国家要供应缺粮人民的粮食，他们就煽动非缺粮户向国家闹供应，使缺粮人民得不到供应而对党和政府不满。这些破坏活动，决不是个别的和偶然发生的现象，而是剥削阶级破坏社会主义改造的一种表现。破坏分子的这种罪恶活动，虽然经过各地人民的揭发，各地政府的依法惩处，但在一个相当长的时期内还是不会停止的。在进一步贯彻粮食政策的工作中，农村工作人员要善于依靠群众，提高群众的觉悟程度，以便随时揭发和打击一切坏分子的破坏活动。有的人认为：农村中经过了多次的群众运动和革命斗争，地主、富农都变得老实了；国家实行了粮食统购统销政策，奸商、反革命分子对粮食搞不了什么鬼了。这是麻痹自己，便利敌人的极其有害的思想。只有彻底克服这种麻痹思想，才能防止和肃清一切坏分子对粮食政策的破坏活动。
