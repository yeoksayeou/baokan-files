Peace Must Triumph Over War

The World Peace Assembly held in Helsinki, attended by representatives of the people of sixty-eight countries, has completed the task entrusted to it by the people of all nations, fulfilling the ardent expectations of the world's people. This conference strengthened the unity of peace-loving people, expanded the influence of peace forces, and conveyed the desire of people around the world for peace to the entire world.

The more than 1,800 delegates attending the World Peace Assembly came from various groups and held various opinions. However, they unanimously adopted all the opinions, resolutions, and recommendations of the seven committees of the conference, and adopted the Declaration of the World Peace Assembly. This is a tremendous achievement for the world peace movement, and it will greatly promote the further development of the peace movement.

The results of the World Peace Assembly show that despite the different views of the people of all countries, they have a common basic requirement: to defend peace and prevent war. The conference showed that people are fully capable of trusting and cooperating with each other. Peace gives the people of all countries the opportunity to create happy and beautiful lives, while war will destroy everything beautiful. For the sake of peace and a good life, the people of all countries demand to strengthen friendship and cooperation with each other, to promote economic and cultural exchanges, and to resolutely oppose policies that create hostility and hatred, and policies of arms expansion and war preparation that cause poverty and destruction. This is why the World Peace Assembly was able to reach a consensus. The consensus of the people of all countries on defending peace and preventing war is the isolation and failure of the forces of war.

The People's Republic of China has consistently pursued a peaceful foreign policy. The Chinese people have always cherished peace and actively struggled for peace. Four hundred million Chinese people once responded to the World Peace Council's call in the "Appeal to the People of the World" and signed the declaration banning the use of atomic weapons. We warmly welcome and support the documents and declarations adopted by the World Peace Assembly and are willing to work to achieve the goals listed in these documents and declarations. In his closing speech at the conference, Guo Moruo, speaking as a representative of the Chinese people, expressed the wishes of the Chinese people, saying: "The Chinese people will prove with more facts in the future that the Chinese people are loyal friends of peace."

The Declaration of the World Peace Assembly points out that the primary responsibility of the Four Power Summit is to overcome mutual distrust. The conference places the greatest hopes on the Four Power Summit, which is absolutely necessary. The main purpose of the Four Power Conference, as the Soviet government has repeatedly emphasized, is to ease international tensions and strengthen mutual trust between countries, which is urgently needed to strengthen peace. Since the end of World War II, international relations of cooperation and mutual trust have been undermined by the "Cold War" policy and the "position of strength" policy pursued by the U.S. aggressive forces. Peace-loving countries and people have made ten years of efforts to restore this relationship. Now, the first summit of the major powers in ten years has resumed. This conference has a responsibility to eliminate distrust between member states. It has a responsibility to discuss major international issues, including the Far East issue, without interfering in the internal affairs of other countries, in order to ease the situation and consolidate peace. The people of all countries believe that this conference should live up to their ardent expectations.

The fundamental issue of consolidating peace is universal disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons. The widespread desire for universal disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons has been clearly reflected in the huge signature campaign launched by the people of all countries in response to the World Peace Council's "Appeal to the People of the World." The Committee on Disarmament and Atomic Weapons of the World Peace Assembly also unanimously adopted the decision to strive for the prohibition of atomic weapons, the destruction of stockpiled atomic weapons, and the peaceful use of atomic energy, and recommended striving for the convening of a conference on disarmament. In this regard, it is known that the proposals put forward by the Soviet government on May 10 have eliminated the obstacles that existed on this issue. Now it remains to be seen whether the Western countries are willing to reach an agreement. The resolution of the World Peace Assembly also opposes the policy of strength and the policy of military blocs, which seriously threaten peace and violate the provisions of the United Nations Charter.

The road to guaranteeing the security of all countries is not through the policy of establishing military blocs, but through the peaceful coexistence of countries with different systems, and through the establishment of a collective security system. The World Peace Assembly advocates that the foundation of a universal collective security in Europe must be laid in accordance with the principles announced at the Bandung Conference and the Belgrade talks, and believes that Germany must be reunified, not allowed to join any military bloc, and guaranteed that it will not revive militarism. In order to ensure peace and security in Asia and the Far East, the World Peace Assembly has put forward a series of fair and reasonable proposals. It believes that foreign troops must withdraw from the Chinese territory of Taiwan, Taiwan must be returned to the People's Republic of China, and the legitimate status of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations must be restored; it advocates complying with the Geneva Agreement on the ceasefire in Indochina; advocates that relevant countries convene a conference on the Korean issue; and it also calls for a peaceful solution to the Goa and West Irian issues. All of these are steps that should be taken to ease international tensions and eliminate new wars.

Peace-loving people around the world warmly praise the just declaration issued by their representatives from Helsinki. This is another magnificent march of peace by the people.

The current international situation provides favorable conditions for striving to achieve all the proposals put forward by the World Peace Assembly. From East to West, the efforts of the Soviet Union and other peace-loving countries are converging with the efforts of the people, becoming a torrent demanding the easing of the situation. The success of the Asian-African Conference, the signing of the Austrian Treaty, the improvement of Soviet-Yugoslav relations, the publication of the Soviet-Indian Declaration and the Polish-Indian Declaration, the Soviet-Japanese negotiations and the Soviet Union's proposal on establishing diplomatic relations with West Germany, all these developments have greatly encouraged the struggle of the people of all countries for peace, and formed an irresistible driving force for the continued development of the international situation in a direction conducive to peace.

However, it must be noted that the forces of war have not been reconciled to failure. Powerful figures in the U.S. aggressive bloc are trying to reverse the development of the international situation so that they can continue to pursue the "Cold War" policy and the "policy of strength" of preparing for a new war. Dulles's remarks at a press conference on June 28 showed that a part of the U.S. ruling group has not the slightest sincerity in strengthening mutual trust between countries and promoting the success of the Four Power Conference. Dulles asserted that the Four Power Conference "is not intended to make any substantial decisions in any case," while he tried his best to slander that the Soviet Union had "lost interest" in the issue of German reunification. Instead of trying to eliminate distrust in international relations, Dulles tried to maintain and deepen this distrust. He stubbornly refused to establish a genuine European collective security system, saying it was because the United States could not "unite with people it does not trust." On the issue of disarmament, which the people of the world are eager for, Dulles deliberately narrowed it down to the so-called "reducing the burden of armaments" in Europe, so that the United States could freely rearm West Germany and keep the United States outside the scope of disarmament. In Asia, the United States has taken no action on the issue of holding negotiations to ease tensions in the Taiwan region. Dulles also insisted that a "stalemate" had "formed" on this issue. On the issue of Indochina, the United States is using various methods to undermine the Geneva Agreement, turning South Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia into U.S. military bases. Dulles said that the United States and the Ngo Dinh Diem group "did not participate in the Geneva ceasefire agreement," wanting to use this as an excuse for them to sabotage the Vietnamese elections. Dulles's remarks fully exposed the U.S. ambition to resist and undermine the Four Power Conference and to intensify tensions in Asia and the Far East. This is not allowed by peace-loving people of all countries.

In this situation, the people of all countries must also wage a resolute struggle to win peace and realize all the proposals put forward by the World Peace Assembly.

The World Peace Assembly has issued a great call to the people of the world: to support the Four Power Conference to negotiate in good faith, and to oppose the forces that undermine the conference. This is the first step in launching a more powerful struggle to defend peace. The unity and growth of the forces of peace are playing a decisive role in the destiny of mankind. Let us unite and continue to move forward; peace must triumph over war.

　　和平一定要战胜战争
    六十八个国家的人民的代表在赫尔辛基举行的世界和平大会，完成了各国人民付托给它的任务，满足了世界人民对它的热烈期待。这个会议加强了爱好和平人民的团结，扩大了和平力量的影响，把各国人民争取和平的愿望传达给全世界。
    出席世界和平大会的一千八百多位代表是来自各种不同的团体和持有各种不同见解的人士。但是他们一致通过了会议七个委员会的全部意见、决议和建议，并通过了世界和平大会宣言。这是世界和平运动的巨大成就，它将大大推动和平运动的进一步发展。
    世界和平大会的结果表明，尽管各国人民有着不同的见解，但是他们有着共同的基本要求：保卫和平、防止战争。大会表明人民完全能够相互信任，相互合作。和平使各国人民有机会创造幸福美好的生活，而战争将使一切美好的东西遭到摧残和破坏。为了和平和美好的生活，各国人民要求加强相互之间的友谊和合作，要求促进经济和文化的交流，而坚决反对制造敌对和仇视的政策，反对引起贫困和破坏的扩军备战的政策。这就是为什么世界和平大会能够取得共同一致的意见的原因。各国人民在保卫和平和防止战争问题上的一致，就是战争势力的孤立和失败。
    中华人民共和国自始就奉行和平外交政策。中国人民一向珍爱和平，并积极为争取和平而斗争。有四万万中国人曾经响应世界和平理事会“告全世界人民书”的号召，在禁止使用原子武器的宣言上签了名。我们热烈欢迎和支持世界和平大会所通过的文件和宣言，并愿意为实现这些文件和宣言所列举的目标而努力。在大会的闭幕词中，郭沫若以中国人民代表的身份所讲的话，表达了中国人民的心愿，他说：“中国人民今后将以更多的事实证明：中国人民是和平的忠实朋友。”
    世界和平大会宣言指出：四大国首脑会议的首要职责是克服相互间的不信任。大会对四国首脑会议寄以最大的期望，这是完全必要的。四大国会议的主要目的，正如苏联政府一再强调的，是要缓和国际紧张局势和加强国与国之间的相互信任，这正是加强和平所迫切需要的。第二次世界大战结束以来，国际间合作互信的关系遭到了美国侵略势力所奉行的“冷战”政策和“实力地位”政策的破坏。为了恢复这种关系，爱好和平的国家和人民作了十年的努力。现在，十年来第一次的大国首脑会议恢复举行。这个会议有责任消除会员国之间的不信任。它有责任在不干涉别国内政的情况下，讨论重大国际问题，包括远东问题在内，以便缓和局势、巩固和平。各国人民认为这个会议应该不辜负他们对它的热烈期望。
    巩固和平的根本问题，是普遍裁减军备和禁止原子武器。要求普遍裁减军备和禁止原子武器的广泛愿望，已清楚地反映在各国人民为响应世界和平理事会的“告全世界人民书”而展开的巨大规模的签名运动上。世界和平大会裁减军备和原子武器问题委员会又一致通过了必须争取禁止原子武器，销毁储存的原子武器，以及争取和平利用原子能的决定，并且建议争取召开一个关于裁减军备的会议。在这方面，人们知道，苏联政府五月十日提出的建议已经消除了在这个问题上存在着的障碍。现在就要看西方国家是否愿意达成协议了。世界和平大会的决议也反对实力政策和军事集团政策，这种政策严重地威胁着和平，并且也违反联合国宪章的规定。
    保障各国安全的道路，不是通过建立军事集团的政策，而是通过不同制度国家的和平共处，通过建立集体安全体系来达到的。世界和平大会主张必须根据万隆会议和贝尔格莱德会谈所宣布的原则来奠定欧洲普遍集体安全的基础，并且认为必须使德国恢复统一，不使它参加任何军事集团，保证它不复活军国主义。为了保障亚洲和远东的和平和安全，世界和平大会提出了一系列公正合理的主张。它认为必须使外国军队撤出中国领土台湾，把台湾归还给中华人民共和国，恢复中华人民共和国在联合国的合法地位；它主张遵守关于印度支那停战的日内瓦协定；主张有关国家召开关于朝鲜问题的会议；它还要求和平解决果阿和西伊里安问题。所有这一切都是缓和国际紧张局势和消除新战争所应当采取的步骤。
    全世界爱好和平人民热烈赞扬他们的代表们从赫尔辛基发出的正义宣告。这是人民又一次雄壮的和平进军。
    目前的国际局势对于争取实现世界和平大会提出的一切主张，提供了有利的条件。从东方到西方，苏联和其他爱好和平的国家的努力正在同人民的努力汇合，成为要求缓和局势的洪流。亚非会议的成功，奥地利条约的签订，苏南关系的改善，苏印声明和波印声明的发表，苏日谈判和苏联关于同西德建交的建议，所有这一些发展都使各国人民争取和平的斗争获得了重大的鼓舞，而形成为势不可当的推动国际局势继续朝着有利于和平的前途发展的动力。
    但是，不可不注意到战争势力并没有甘心失败。美国侵略集团的有势力人物，正力图扭转国际局势的发展，以便他们继续推行准备新战争的“冷战”政策和“实力政策”。杜勒斯六月二十八日在记者招待会上发表的谈话，就表明美国统治集团中的一部分人，对于加强国际间相互信任、促进四大国会议的成功连半点诚意都没有。杜勒斯一口咬定四大国会议“无论如何是不打算作出任何实质性的决定的”，同时他竭力诬蔑苏联已对统一德国问题“失去兴趣”。杜勒斯不但不努力消除国际关系中的不信任，相反的还力图保持和加深这种不信任。他硬不肯建立真正的欧洲集体安全体系，说是因为美国不能同它“不信任的人联合”。对于全世界人民所渴望的裁减军备问题，杜勒斯故意把它缩小成为在欧洲方面所谓“减轻军备负担”的问题，以便美国能够放手重新武装西德，并使美国置身于裁减军备的范围以外。在亚洲方面，美国对于为缓和台湾地区紧张局势而举行谈判的问题，没有采取任何行动。杜勒斯还硬说在这个问题上已经“形成一个僵局”。在印度支那的问题上，美国正在用各种办法破坏日内瓦协议，把南越、老挝和柬埔寨变成美国的军事基地。杜勒斯说美国和吴庭艳集团“都没有参加日内瓦停战协定”，想以此作为他们破坏越南选举的借口。杜勒斯的这些言论充分暴露了美国企图抵制和破坏四大国会议，并加剧亚洲和远东紧张局势的野心。这是各国爱好和平人民所不能容许的。
    在这种情况下，各国人民还必须为争取和平和实现世界和平大会所提出的一切主张而进行坚决的斗争。
    世界和平大会向全世界人民发出了伟大的号召：支持四大国会议以诚意来协商谈判，反对对会议的破坏势力。这是更有力地展开保卫和平的斗争的首要步骤。和平力量的团结和壮大，正在对人类命运起着决定性的作用。让我们团结起来，继续前进；和平一定要战胜战争。
