    Emphasize the Role of Dikes and Enhance Flood Resistance
    Yang Wenhan, Director of the Engineering Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Water Resources

    The Chinese people began to use dikes as a weapon to fight floods more than four thousand years ago. After continuous development over successive dynasties, the total length of larger dikes across the country has reached 50,000 kilometers. These dikes protect extremely vast areas and the lives and property of the people.

    The middle and lower plains of several major rivers in China (including the Yellow River, Hai River, Huai River plain, the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River plain, the Songhua River, Liao River plain, and the Pearl River Delta) cover more than one million square kilometers, accounting for more than one-tenth of the country's total area. These areas are mostly alluvial plains of rivers, with fertile land, a mild climate, abundant rainfall, rich products, dense population, and developed industry and commerce. About half of the country's 600 million people live in this region, and many large cities such as Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Nanjing, Wuhan, Guangzhou, Shenyang, and Harbin are also located in this area. Currently, the proportion of light and heavy industries and major transportation lines in this region is also the largest. However, these plains formed by river alluvium are mostly lower than the flood season water level of local rivers and lakes, while coastal areas are mostly lower than the high tide water level. Before the construction of dikes, these plains were areas of periodic flooding or seawater intrusion. After the construction of dikes, safety began to be guaranteed. It is conceivable that if these dikes were to collapse, the consequences would be very serious.

    Historical records of dike breaches are countless. The Yellow River has breached more than 1,500 times in the past four thousand years, with more than twenty-six major changes in its course. Each breach has brought severe losses to the lives and property of the people. In 1938, the Kuomintang reactionaries dug open the Yellow River dike at Huayuankou, causing a severe disaster that affected 12.5 million people and killed more than 890,000. In 1931, the Yangtze River and Huai River floods affected a total area of 318,000 square kilometers, killing 3.7 million people due to famine and directly drowning 265,000. These figures are staggering.

    Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, thanks to the Party and government's emphasis on water conservancy, in addition to actively carrying out comprehensive harnessing projects on major rivers, we have also vigorously repaired dikes in various places. In the past few years, the total amount of earthwork for dike repair has been about 3 billion cubic meters, which has improved the flood resistance of dikes in various places. Although the Yangtze River, Huai River, and North China region experienced particularly large floods in 1954, the strengthening of dikes, proper defense, and the storage of water by many reservoir and dam projects reduced the harm of floods and protected the safety of the lives and property of the broad masses of people and important cities, transportation, and industrial and mining enterprises, playing a certain guaranteeing role in the development of China's socialist construction. After the 1954 flood season, the People's Government allocated a lot of funds to carry out large-scale dike repair projects, further strengthening the dikes of some major rivers, so that the flood control capacity of these rivers' dikes has been improved.

    However, some people believe that using dikes for flood control is a backward method and not very effective. Therefore, they do not actively maintain and strengthen existing dikes to improve their flood resistance, but passively wait for the completion of comprehensive harnessing projects. This kind of thinking and practice is obviously wrong.

    Of course, for the defense of particularly large floods of a river, it is not enough to rely solely on dikes. Especially for larger rivers, it is necessary to adopt the construction of large water storage projects such as reservoirs and other measures to completely eliminate floods and maximize the use of natural water resources. However, these huge projects cannot be completed overnight. It should be understood that the comprehensive harnessing project of a river, from surveying and planning to design and construction, requires a lot of arduous work and a considerable amount of time, a huge amount of funds, and a lot of modern technical equipment and industrial materials. Under China's current conditions, it is impossible to start comprehensive harnessing of all rivers. However, there are currently 50,000 kilometers of existing dikes across the country. As long as we maintain them well and defend them well, they can play a great role in flood prevention. Dikes are one of the most important tools in the current flood control struggle, and it is wrong to ignore their role.

    In recent years, there has been progress in dike repair. However, there are still many problems in this work. In order to enhance the flood resistance of dikes, these problems must be solved.

    First of all, many areas have not seriously done a good job in dike management. In many areas, the dikes are not the responsibility of anyone, and lack maintenance, so the dike body is seriously damaged. Some people arbitrarily graze livestock on the dikes, plant crops, or dig up the turf on the dike slopes, dig manure pits and sweet potato cellars in the dike body; some even cultivate the dike feet into flat ground, and once the flood comes, dangerous situations arise one after another. Although dike management and maintenance work began to attract the attention of leaders in various places after the 1954 flood season, some areas have not grasped this work tightly and have not carried it out well. Some rivers, although there are special management agencies for dikes, only the Yellow River is relatively sound; some rivers that do not have special management agencies have not established a management system. These situations must be given immediate attention.

    Secondly, the quality of some dike bodies and dike foundations is not good, and many hidden dangers have not been eliminated. Most of China's existing dikes were repaired and built on top of old dikes. These old dikes, when they were built at that time, lacked scientific design, the dike foundations were not well selected, and the quality of the project was mostly poor; coupled with long-term poor maintenance, badgers, foxes, rats, termites and other harmful animals and insects dug holes everywhere, coupled with man-made damage, resulting in serious hidden dangers in many dike bodies. Although these dikes have been vigorously repaired and hidden dangers have been eliminated since liberation, the problem of hidden dangers has not been resolved. For example, the main dikes of the Yangtze River (including the Han River) had more than 28,000 dangerous spots during the 1954 flood, of which leaks accounted for 92.5% of all dangerous works. The Jingjiang Dike had more than 6,000 dangerous spots in Jianli County alone. Although the Jingjiang Dike was vigorously repaired after the flood season, when the water level rose to half a meter above the warning level in late June this year, although the number of dangerous works decreased compared with last year, there were still 48 dangerous works. After several years of cone penetration, about 80,000 hidden dangers have been discovered and eliminated in the Yellow River dike, but during the 1954 flood, the phenomenon of water immersion, seepage, and leakage in the Yellow River dike was still relatively serious. During the 1955 ice flood, when the water level exceeded the guaranteed water level by half a meter, leakage occurred universally in the dikes around Lijin. In addition, although many newly built dikes after liberation are generally of better quality, some dike sections are still not up to standard due to heavy rain and snow during construction, tight construction time, heavy tasks, or personnel who lead the dike repair neglecting project quality.

    At present, many areas have begun to attach importance to improving dike quality and eliminating hidden dangers. For example, the Jingjiang Dike adopted methods such as slotting and reconstruction, and external help to intercept seepage in the dike reconstruction last winter and this spring to enhance dike quality; the lower reaches of the Yellow River conducted investigations on the Yellow River dike, and focused on taking measures such as intercepting seepage on the river side, guiding seepage on the back river side, changing soil in slots, and dense cone grouting to treat leaky dike foundations and old breach openings. Many provinces have promoted dike body cone penetration work, which is very good, but some areas still do not pay enough attention to this work, which should be quickly corrected.

    Now, all parts of the country have entered the flood season, and the water level has risen in some areas. The local people are carrying out flood prevention work. In some areas, the river water has not yet risen and preparations are being made to meet the arrival of the flood. All localities should attach importance to the role of dikes and actively take all possible measures to enhance the flood resistance of dikes in order to strive for the victory of flood prevention.

    重视堤防作用，增强堤防抗洪能力
    水利部工程管理局局长　杨文汉
    我国人民在四千多年以前，就开始利用堤防这一武器同洪水进行斗争了。经过历代不断的发展，到目前为止，全国比较大的堤防的总长度有五万公里。这些堤防保护着极为广阔的地区和人民的生命财产。
    我国几条主要江河的中下游平原地区（包括黄河、海河、淮河平原，长江中下游平原，松花江、辽河平原及珠江三角洲等地）共有一百多万平方公里，约占全国总面积的十分之一以上，这些地区大多是江河的冲积平原，土地肥沃，气候温和，雨量充足，物产丰富，人口密集，工商业发达。全国六亿人口中约一半都居住在这个区域中，很多大的城市如北京、天津、上海、南京、武汉、广州、沈阳、哈尔滨等也都在这个区域里。目前我国的轻重工业和主要交通线在这个地区里的比重也最大。但是，这些由于江河冲积而成的平原，它们的高度大多低于当地河湖的汛期的洪水位，滨海地区则多低于海水的高潮水位。在没有修筑堤防以前，这些平原都是周期性的洪水泛滥区域或海水侵袭地区，在修起堤防以后，安全才开始得到了保障；可以设想，万一这些堤防发生了溃决，它的后果是很严重的。
    历史上关于堤防溃决的记载，是数不胜数的，黄河四千多年来共决口一千五百多次，比较大的改道就有二十六次之多，每次决口改道都给人民的生命财产带来严重的损失。一九三八年国民党反动派在花园口掘开黄河大堤，就造成了受灾人口达一千二百五十万，死亡人口八十九万以上的严重灾害。一九三一年长江、淮河大水的受灾面积共有三十一万八千平方公里，死于灾荒者达三百七十万人，直接被淹死的二十六万五千人。这些数字是很惊人的。
    中华人民共和国成立以来，由于党和政府对于水利事业的重视，除了积极进行各主要江河的根治工程以外，同时大力修整了各地的堤防。几年来修整堤防的土方总数有约三十亿公方，提高了各地堤防的抗洪能力。一九五四年长江、淮河及华北地区虽然发生了特大洪水，但是由于堤防的加固、防守得宜，以及许多水库闸坝工程的拦蓄，减轻了洪水的为害，保障了广大人民生命财产和重要城市、交通、工矿的安全，对我国社会主义建设事业的进行起了一定的保障作用。一九五四年汛后，人民政府又拨发了很多的经费，进行规模巨大的堤防整修工程，对一些主要江河的堤防予以更进一步的加强，使得这些河流的堤防的防洪能力都有提高。
    可是有一部分人认为用堤防防洪是落后的办法，作用不大，因而对现有堤防不积极养护和加固以提高堤防的防洪能力，只是消极地等待根治工程的完成，这种想法和做法显然是不对的。
    当然，对于一条河流特大洪水的防御，仅仅依靠堤防是不够的。尤其是比较大的河流，必须采用修建水库等巨大蓄洪工程和配合其他措施，才能彻底消灭水患和最大限度地利用自然的水利资源。但是这些巨大的工程不是一朝一夕所能完成的。要知道一条河流的根治工程从查勘、规划到设计、施工，都需要经过很多艰巨的工作和相当长的时间，需要数目巨大的资金，以及很多近代化的技术设备和工业器材。按我国目前条件是不可能把所有河流都开始根治的。但是全国目前却有五万公里现成的堤防，只要我们养护得好，防守得好，在防御洪水上就能起很大的作用。堤防是目前防洪斗争中很重要的工具之一，忽视堤防的作用是错误的。
    近几年来，在修整堤防方面是有成绩的。但是在这项工作中还有不少问题，为了增强堤防的抗洪能力，就必须解决这些问题。
    首先，许多地区没有认真做好堤防管理工作。不少地区的堤防无人负责，缺乏养护，因此堤身损害严重；有些群众任意在堤上放牧牲畜，种植作物，或把堤坡上的草皮连根刨出，在堤身上挖粪坑、挖红薯窖；有的甚至将堤脚耕成平地，一旦洪水到来，险象丛生。堤防管理养护工作，在一九五四年汛后虽已开始引起各地领导的重视，但是有的地区对这项工作还是抓得不紧，没有很好进行。一些河流，虽有管理堤防的专管机构，但只有黄河比较健全；有些不设专管机构的河流，也没有建立起管理制度。这些情况必须立即引起重视。
    其次，有的堤身、堤基质量不好，许多隐患还没有消除。我国现有的堤防多是从旧有的堤防培修起来的。这些旧有的堤防在当时修筑时，由于缺乏科学的设计，堤基没有经过很好的选择，工程质量多半不好；再加长期养护不好，獾、狐、鼠、白蚁等害兽害虫到处打洞钻穴，加上人为的破坏，致使很多堤身隐患严重。这些堤防，解放以后虽然经过大力培修和消除隐患，使堤身质量有所提高，但是隐患的问题还没有解决。如长江的干堤（包括汉江）在一九五四年大水时共出险二万八千多处，其中漏洞占全部险工的百分之九二·五之多，荆江大堤在江陵县境内就出险六千多处，荆江堤防汛后虽经过了大力整修，今年六月下旬当水位涨到警戒水位半公尺以上时，险工虽然比去年减少了，但仍有四十八处险工出现。黄河大堤经过几年来的锥探，共发现和消灭隐患约八万处，但是一九五四年大水时，全黄河河堤的浸水、渗水、漏水的现象还是比较严重。在一九五五年凌汛中，当水位超过保证水位半公尺时，利津一带的大堤，普遍发生漏水现象。此外，解放后新修的许多堤防，虽然在质量上一般都较好，但有的由于施工期间雨雪多、施工时间紧迫、任务大或领导工程修整的人员忽视工程质量等原因，还有某些堤段的质量不合标准。
    目前很多地区已经开始重视改善堤质、消灭隐患的工作。如荆江大堤在去冬今春复堤中采取了抽槽翻筑、外帮截渗等方法以增强堤质；黄河下游地区对黄河大堤进行了调查，并重点采取临河截渗、背河导渗、抽槽换土、密锥灌浆等措施，对漏水堤基，旧的决口口门也都正设法进行处理。很多省推行了堤身锥探工作是很好的，但是仍有某些地区对于这项工作注意不够，这是应该赶快纠正的。
    现在，全国各地都已进入汛期，有的地区水位已经上涨，当地人民正在进行防汛工作。有的地区河水还未上涨，正在准备迎接洪水的到来。各地都应重视堤防的作用，并积极采取一切可能的措施增强堤防抗洪能力，以争取防汛的胜利。
