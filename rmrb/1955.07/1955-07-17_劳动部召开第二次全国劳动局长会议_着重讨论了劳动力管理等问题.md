    Ministry of Labor Convenes Second National Labor Bureau Chiefs Conference
    Focuses on Discussing Labor Force Management and Other Issues

    Xinhua News Agency News: The Ministry of Labor recently convened the Second National Labor Bureau Chiefs Conference in Beijing. This conference focused on discussing issues such as labor force management, wage work, and the current responsibilities and tasks of labor departments.

    After first analyzing the current situation of excessive personnel in enterprises, particularly the excessive number of non-production personnel and the unreasonable use of labor, the conference pointed out that strengthening management and overcoming waste are the primary tasks in labor force management. The conference studied the principles and specific methods of labor force management and also studied the problem of dealing with surplus labor in enterprises, especially construction enterprises.

    The conference pointed out that relevant departments in various regions should take active measures to overcome the serious egalitarianism and chaos that exist in current wage issues, and strive to basically unify and rationalize the national wage system within the next two to three years to meet the needs of production and construction. The conference focused on arranging this year's wage work and conducted specific research on current urgent problems, such as actively preparing to change the wage point system to a monetary wage system, promoting and improving the piece-rate wage system, establishing and rectifying the reward system, focusing on establishing piece-rate, high-temperature, and harmful health wage rates, establishing a regular promotion system, and handling retained wages.

    The conference pointed out that the labor department is the agency that uniformly manages labor work, and its basic task is to serve production and construction. The business scope of the labor department is to manage wages, labor force allocation, technical worker training, labor protection, and labor issues in capitalist enterprises. The labor department should, in accordance with national policies, draft and formulate draft laws, resolutions, orders, and rules and regulations related to labor issues; supervise and inspect the implementation of national labor policies and laws by various departments and enterprises, and handle more important labor work issues between various departments and enterprises. The conference discussed issues such as the training of technical workers, labor protection, labor issues in capitalist enterprises, and labor employment, and also studied the leadership relationships and cadre issues of labor departments.

    The conference concluded by pointing out that the labor department is the government agency that uniformly manages labor work, and the business it manages is related to the work of various departments of the national economy and the vital interests of millions of workers. Therefore, labor department cadres must establish an overall concept, strive to be correct in handling problems, and maintain close contact with all relevant units.

    This conference was held from May 27th to June 20th. More than 160 people attended the conference, including the directors of labor bureaus of various provinces and cities, the chairmen of some provincial and municipal trade union federations, and the personnel in charge of labor and wages from relevant central agencies.
