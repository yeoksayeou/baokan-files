Xinhua News Agency, June 20th: The American reactionaries, disregarding the solemn appeals of the broadest strata of people around the world, heinously murdered Julius and Ethel Rosenberg on the evening of the 19th.

According to American news agency reports, the Special Tribunal of the U.S. Supreme Court declared invalid on the afternoon of the 19th the stay of execution order issued by Judge Douglas. The Rosenberg’s defense lawyers requested a postponement of the execution in order to submit a new application to the President, which was also rejected by the Supreme Court. Half an hour later, Eisenhower issued a statement, obviously prepared in advance, once again announcing his refusal to use presidential power to cancel the death sentence imposed on the Rosenbergs, finally cutting off the Rosenberg's avenue of appeal. The Rosenbergs' chief defense lawyer, Bloch, personally went to the White House to request a meeting with the duty officer to submit an emergency application, but was barred by the police at the gate and refused an audience. At this point, the American reactionaries' plot to murder the innocent was completely ready, and Federal Court Officer Carroll immediately rushed to New York's Sing Sing Prison, where he executed the heroic American peace fighters, Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, one after the other, in the electric chair on the afternoon of the 19th, local time, at around 8 p.m.

Xinhua News Agency, June 20th: The American reactionaries' heinous act of illegally murdering the Rosenbergs immediately aroused angry protests from righteous people around the world.

Thousands of demonstrators in front of the White House in Washington shouted protests when they heard the news of the Rosenbergs' murder. The National Committee for Fair Trial in the Rosenberg Case issued a statement saying, "We will continue the struggle until the Rosenbergs' names are cleared and they are proven innocent." Thousands of people also demonstrated in New York.

When news of the Rosenbergs' murder reached Europe, people held demonstrations outside the American embassies and consulates in countries such as Britain, France, and Italy. In London, thousands of people marched to Hyde Park, shouting protest slogans. Many people lay in the street, blocking traffic. One hundred and twenty foot, mounted, and motorcycle police guarded the U.S. Embassy. The London Daily Worker published the news of the Rosenbergs' murder with the large-letter headline "Murder!"

Before the Rosenbergs were murdered, a 20,000-person protest rally was held in Paris. The news of the Rosenbergs' murder reached France late at night, and many people immediately held demonstrations near the American Embassy. The French Committee to Save the Rosenbergs called on all French people to hold protest demonstrations.

In Italy, thousands of people demonstrated in Rome, Turin, Milan, and other places. The Italian General Confederation of Labor ordered a twenty-five-minute work stoppage to protest the American reactionaries' illegal murder of the Rosenbergs.

A group of demonstrators in Toronto, Canada, shouted protests in front of the American Consulate.

    和平战士罗森堡夫妇惨遭杀害
    全世界人民愤怒抗议美国政府卑怯行为
    【新华社二十日讯】美国反动当局不顾全世界最广泛阶层人民的严正呼吁，于十九日傍晚悍然杀害了罗森堡夫妇。
    据美国通讯社消息，美国最高法院特别庭十九日中午宣布道格拉斯法官缓期执刑的裁决无效。罗森堡夫妇辩护律师要求暂缓执刑，以便向总统提出新的申请，亦遭到最高法院拒绝。半小时之后，艾森豪威尔即发表显然是先就预备好的声明，再一次宣布拒绝运用总统职权取消对罗森堡夫妇所判的死刑，最后杜绝了罗森堡夫妇申诉之门。罗森堡夫妇的首席辩护律师布洛克曾亲自到白宫请求会见值班负责官员提出紧急申请，被警察拦于门外，不予接见。至此，美国反动派杀害无辜的阴谋完全就绪，联邦法院执行官卡罗尔随即赶赴纽约新新监狱，于十九日下午当地时间八时余先后用电椅杀死了英勇的美国和平战士罗森堡夫妇。
    【新华社二十日讯】美国反动派非法杀害罗森堡夫妇的恶行立即激起了全世界正直人民的愤怒抗议。
    华盛顿白宫前数千人的示威队伍听到罗森堡夫妇被杀害的消息后激动地高呼抗议。争取罗森堡案公正裁决全国委员会发表谈话说：“我们将继续斗争，直到罗森堡夫妇的名字弄清白了，并且证明他们是无辜的时候为止。”纽约也举行了数千人的示威。
    当罗森堡夫妇被杀害的消息传到欧洲后，驻在英、法、意等国家的美国大使馆和领事馆外都有人民举行示威。在伦敦，数千人高呼着抗议口号涌向海德公园示威。许多人躺在街上，使交通为之阻塞。美国大使馆周围有一百二十名步、骑和摩托警察把守。伦敦工人日报用“谋杀！”的大字标题，登载了罗森堡夫妇被害的消息。
    巴黎在罗森堡夫妇被害前，曾举行了二万人的抗议集会。罗森堡夫妇被害消息传到法国已是深晚，立即有许多人在美国大使馆附近举行示威。法国拯救罗森堡夫妇委员会号召所有的法国人举行抗议示威。
    在意大利，罗马、都灵、米兰等地举行了数千人的示威。意大利总工会下令停工二十五分钟，抗议美国反动派非法杀害罗森堡夫妇。
    加拿大多伦多一群示威者在美国领事馆前高呼抗议。
