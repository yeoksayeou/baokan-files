World Opinion
Condemns the U.S. for Conniving with Syngman Rhee to Sabotage the Agreement

Korean Press Publishes Comments
Resolutely Demanding the U.S. Give a Sincere Answer

[Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 23rd] The Korean press continues to condemn the U.S. for conniving with the Syngman Rhee gang to coerce the retention of Korean People's Army prisoners of war and seriously undermine the agreement. They resolutely demand that the U.S. clearly state its attitude and give a sincere response to the questions and demands raised by Marshal Kim Il-sung and General Peng Dehuai in their letter to Clark.

The "Democratic Korea" newspaper published an editorial on the 22nd, stating: "The whole world knows that today, the U.S. military actually controls the South Korean puppet government and puppet army. If the U.S. ruling clique thinks that even such an obvious fact can be denied, then it is tantamount to the U.S. admitting that all its statements at the negotiating table for the past two years have been empty talk." The editorial stated: "Who can believe that all the words and actions of the Syngman Rhee gang were not made under the instructions of the U.S. warmongers? We resolutely demand that the U.S. take swift measures to restore the state of affairs before this incident occurred." The editorial stated: "Whether the Korean armistice can be realized depends entirely on how the U.S. responds to the questions raised by our commanders. The U.S. must give a sincere answer and demonstrate its attitude before the conscience of the world."

The Korean Central News Agency published a commentary on the 22nd, stating: "Since Clark admits that he had long anticipated that the Syngman Rhee gang would create such atrocities, why did the U.S. not take measures to prevent this serious incident from happening? And why has it consistently failed to take measures to prevent the incident from escalating after it occurred?" The commentary stated: "The U.S. should be responsible for this incident. The U.S. cannot shirk the responsibility for all the consequences arising therefrom." The commentary emphasized: "Seriously answering the questions and demands raised by our commanders is a test of the U.S.'s sincerity in the armistice negotiations. All the Korean people and freedom-loving people around the world are closely watching the U.S.'s attitude."

The "Labor News" published an editorial on the 21st, stating: "All kind people around the world are unanimously indignant at the U.S.'s connivance with the Syngman Rhee gang's provocative act of forcibly detaining our prisoners of war." The editorial stated: "This incident has even aroused unease and confusion within the imperialist camp. The incident is serious, but the problem is simple. If the U.S. still has the sincerity to achieve an armistice, then it should resolve this incident it created as soon as possible."

Czechoslovak and Polish Newspapers
Condemn the U.S. for Not Taking Steps to Prevent This Incident

[Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 23rd] The Czechoslovak "People's Defense News," in its world situation commentary column on the 21st, wrote that Syngman Rhee's "release" of a large number of prisoners of war was "the worst and most treacherous provocative act attempting to undermine peace." The "People's Defense News" said that despite Syngman Rhee's frequent public advocacy of continuing the war at all costs, the U.S. had not tried to prevent this incident. Therefore, "the full responsibility for this barbaric and perfidious act by the Syngman Rhee gang undoubtedly falls on the U.S. military authorities, the United Nations Command, and the U.S. government." The "People's Defense News" concluded: "World opinion unanimously condemns Syngman Rhee's provocative actions and condemns the U.S. occupying authorities for not taking any steps to prevent this incident."

Polish newspapers have all published the letter from Marshal Kim Il-sung and General Peng Dehuai to Clark, and news of the Syngman Rhee gang's continuous forced detention of prisoners of war. "People's Forum" published an article entitled "The Significance of Syngman Rhee's Provocation and the Road to a Korean Armistice." The article stated that this provocation has aroused great indignation in many countries. The article emphasized that Syngman Rhee could not have carried out this shameless act of sabotage without the knowledge of the U.S. authorities. The newspaper said that the demands put forward in the letter from Marshal Kim Il-sung and General Peng Dehuai to Clark express the consistent efforts of the people of all countries to truly end the Korean War and sign and implement the armistice agreement. The newspaper said, "Given the fact that the South Korean army is under the command of the 'United Nations Command,' the 'United Nations Command' can and must be held responsible for acts of sabotage of the armistice agreement by all the troops under its command, including the South Korean army."

"Warsaw Life" newspaper, referring to Syngman Rhee's recent provocative actions, said that this matter was done in front of his U.S. masters, and when the conditions for achieving an armistice were almost complete. This provocative action by the U.S. puppet Syngman Rhee is unprecedented in the history of international relations. This action has been publicly called "sabotage" by many countries. "Warsaw Life" concluded that the provocateurs and shameless warmongers have isolated themselves, placing themselves in a politically and morally isolated position among all mankind.

Chairman of the All-India Peace Council, Kitchlew
Points Out that Rhee's Detention of Prisoners of War is to Continue the War

[Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 23rd] Dr. Saifuddin Kitchlew, Chairman of the All-India Peace Council, called on all peace committees throughout India to hold rallies on June 25th to demand peace in Korea and put forward the slogan: "International agreements must be respected; prisoners of war must be repatriated and an armistice agreement must be signed."

In a statement issued in New Delhi on June 22nd, Dr. Kitchlew said that the people of all countries had hoped to celebrate the realization of peace in Korea on June 25th and the end of the war that slaughtered and destroyed human lives and well-being. But Syngman Rhee released more than 25,000 prisoners of war, deliberately disrupting the armistice negotiations. Such behavior is unheard of and serves only one purpose - to continue the war.

"Since the armistice was in sight, in the past few days, Syngman Rhee has repeatedly threatened to disrupt the negotiations. It is clear that if the United Nations Command had taken appropriate steps when Syngman Rhee announced his intentions, he would not have been able to take this step with such serious consequences.

"However, apart from making some conciliatory remarks and promises regarding military treaties and aid, the U.S. government did not restrain him at all. Therefore, the United Nations Command cannot shirk its responsibility for failing to take appropriate steps to prevent Syngman Rhee from realizing his threats, especially when the South Korean army is under the control of the United Nations Command."

Dr. Kitchlew emphasized: "Now is the time for ordinary people to state in no uncertain terms that if peace is to be won and maintained, international agreements must be respected and upheld."

Indian and Pakistani Newspapers Point Out
The U.S. Must Recover the "Released" Prisoners of War

[Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 23rd] Indian and Pakistani newspapers widely commented on Syngman Rhee's provocative behavior in attempting to disrupt the armistice negotiations, believing that the U.S. should be held responsible for this behavior.

The "Indian Times," in an editorial titled "Saving the Armistice" on the 22nd, stated: "The situation demands that we do everything possible to save the armistice. There is no reason to expect the Communists to accept the release of 26,000 North Korean prisoners of war as an inevitable event. Every effort must be made to recover the released prisoners of war." The editorial stated: "In addition to the issue of prisoners of war, the Allied Command also has a responsibility to ensure the safety of the neutral forces going to South Korea to manage the prisoners of war."

The "National Herald" editorial on the 20th said: "The agreement of June 8th on the issue of prisoner of war repatriation was hailed by the world as clearing the last serious obstacles to the Korean armistice and peace. But Syngman Rhee released a large number of the relevant prisoners of war, rendering this agreement useless." The editorial said that Syngman Rhee's actions to disrupt the Korean armistice negotiations "confirmed the view held by many when the Korean War broke out three years ago, that the real aggressor was South rather than Communist North Korea. Syngman Rhee actually believes that it is possible to defeat China and the North Koreans by military force. From this point of view, Syngman Rhee has not learned anything in the last three years." The editorial said, "The only explanation for this enigma of Syngman Rhee seems to be that Syngman Rhee not only represents himself, but also represents certain powerful figures in the U.S. Republican Party who fear the arrival of peace and are therefore determined to block this disaster."

The "Hindustan Standard" editorial on the 20th said: "What must be explained to the world is why the United Nations Command in Korea did not know about such a thing." However, if "as Syngman Rhee implied, then the United Nations Command must have already discovered Syngman Rhee's plan to take action regardless of the prisoner of war repatriation agreement. In fact, Syngman Rhee himself said, 'Most of the United Nations authorities with whom I have spoken about our desire to release prisoners of war are sympathetic to us.' Therefore, if the United Nations Command did indeed condone South Korea releasing more than 25,000 prisoners of war overnight, it would be very shameful."

The "Liberty" newspaper published an editorial on the 21st entitled "The U.S. Government Should Be Held Responsible," saying that without the connivance of the U.S., the Syngman Rhee group could not have carried out such destructive activities.

The "New Century" editorial on the 21st said: "This action has completely exposed the true intentions of Syngman Rhee and his U.S. masters, as well as their ugly conspiracy, to the people of the whole world." "If Syngman Rhee's U.S. masters think that they can escape all guilt by pushing all responsibility onto Syngman Rhee, then they are mistaken."

The "Pakistan Times" published an editorial on the 20th entitled "Ruined the Prospect of Peace," stating: "The seemingly plausible claim that the so-called United Nations Command was completely unaware of this incident from beginning to end does not seem to stand up to close scrutiny."

The "Today" newspaper editorial on the 21st said: Assuming the United States did not condone the Rhee group, then "their hesitation in not taking strict action against Rhee and in not upholding the agreement their own representatives signed, would not make sense.”

Sheffield Shop Representatives of the British Amalgamated Engineering Union
Demand an End to Actions Disrupting the Korean Negotiations

[Xinhua News Agency, 23rd] TASS, London, 22nd: The "Workers' Daily" reported that the quarterly meeting of Sheffield shop representatives of the Amalgamated Engineering Union demanded that the British government do its utmost to prevent the Syngman Rhee group or irresponsible individuals in the U.S. from carrying out any further actions to disrupt the Korean armistice negotiations.

The meeting urged members of the Amalgamated Engineering Union to redouble their efforts to achieve peace, especially on the Korean issue and on the holding of a great power conference and the rapid expansion of trade between East and West.

Swiss Newspapers Publish Comments
Believing that the U.S. Should Bear Full Responsibility for This Incident

[Xinhua News Agency, 23rd] Bern News: Swiss public opinion condemns the Syngman Rhee gang's provocative act of forcibly detaining prisoners of war, and believes that the U.S. military command should bear full responsibility for this incident.

The "People's Rights Newspaper" published a commentary on the 19th, stating that this was a terrible event that could completely disrupt the armistice. The responsibility for this incident should be entirely borne by the United Nations Command. The newspaper said that since the United Nations Command has continued negotiations despite the stalling and opposition of South Korea, and signed an agreement on the issue of prisoners of war, and admitted that the South Korean army is also under its command, then it has a responsibility to ensure that these agreements are complied with. The newspaper pointed out that Syngman Rhee's "release" of prisoners of war was a blatant act of sabotage of the agreement. The Americans' claim that they did not know about South Korea's plan cannot be excused. Because the South Korean government announced that they would release the prisoners of war. The newspaper believes that the Americans had a responsibility to take measures, but they did not do so.

The "Lausanne Daily" published an editorial on the same day, saying that Syngman Rhee's "release" of prisoners of war may cause extremely serious consequences for the future of the Korean negotiations and the war. The newspaper pointed out that the statements of the Korean-Chinese side on this issue are clear. The newspaper said that the United Nations Command and the U.S. government cannot bear the responsibility for the actions of the South Korean government and its army, which confirms the seriousness of the incident.

Newspapers in Many Countries
Demand that Syngman Rhee Be Removed from Power

[Xinhua News Agency, 23rd] Public opinion in many countries demands that Syngman Rhee be removed from power to ensure the implementation of the agreement and the realization of the Korean armistice.

The British "Daily Mail" said: If an armistice cannot be realized, "this is the heinous result of Syngman Rhee's crime. He has shown himself to be unreliable. He must be replaced by other more responsible people. If necessary, his entire government should be overthrown." The newspaper said that the best way for the U.S. to prove its sincerity is to abandon Syngman Rhee. British Broadcasting Corporation commentator Guy Eaton said: "One Labor MP even said that as long as Syngman Rhee is in power in South Korea, an agreement will never be reached. It has also been suggested that the United Nations declare South Korea in a state of emergency to make the removal of the government possible." Wyatt and Donnelly, Labor MPs in the British House of Commons, have called for the arrest or imprisonment of Syngman Rhee and his entire cabinet.

The "Indian Times" said: "The situation demands that we do everything possible to save the armistice... Every effort must be made to recover the released prisoners of war. The South Korean government must be forced to cooperate in this work by giving the heaviest penalties, including immediate dismissal of Syngman Rhee when necessary." The "Delhi Express" said: "If Syngman Rhee remains stubborn, then he should be immediately removed to a position where he can no longer cause trouble."

According to Agence France-Presse, "People close to the United Nations Asian delegation fear that the current interruption of the Panmunjom negotiations may turn into a final breakdown. It is believed that the only way to avoid a breakdown is to take drastic steps to deprive Syngman Rhee of the governmental power he holds." Some Western representatives to the United Nations believe that "Syngman Rhee should be asked to choose between two paths, one is to fully comply with the orders of the United Nations, and the other is to be removed from office."

The Tokyo "Jiji Shinpo" also "suggested that the United States remove that stubborn dictator Syngman Rhee" on the 21st.

    世界各国舆论
    谴责美方纵容李承晚破坏协议
    朝鲜舆论界发表评论
    坚决要求美方作出诚意的回答
    【新华社平壤二十三日电】朝鲜舆论界继续谴责美方纵容李承晚匪帮胁迫扣留朝鲜人民军被俘人员、严重破坏协议的行为，并坚决要求美方对金日成元帅和彭德怀将军在给克拉克的信中所提出的问题和主张明白表示态度，作出诚意的回答。
    “民主朝鲜”报二十二日发表社论说：全世界都知道：今天，美国军队实际上控制着南朝鲜傀儡政府和傀儡军队。如果美国统治集团认为连这样明白的事实也可以否认的话，那就等于美方承认自己两年来在谈判桌上的一切发言都是空话。社论说：谁能相信李承晚匪帮的一切言行不是在美国好战分子的指示下作出来的呢？我们坚决要求美方迅速采取措施，恢复在这个事件发生前的状态。社论说：朝鲜停战能否实现，完全在于美方如何答复我方司令官的质问。美方必须作出诚意的回答，在全世界的良心面前表明自己的态度。
    朝鲜中央通讯社二十二日发表评论说：既然克拉克承认他早就预料到李承晚匪帮要制造这种暴行，那末，美方为什么没有采取防止这种严重事件发生的措施呢？又为什么在事件发生后始终没有采取防止事件扩大的措施呢？评论说：美方应当对这次事件负责。美方无法推卸由此发生的一切后果的责任。评论强调指出：认真答复我方司令官所提出的质问和要求，是美方对停战谈判诚意的考验。全朝鲜人民和全世界爱好自由的人民一起，正严密地注视着美方的态度。
    “劳动新闻”二十一日发表社论说：全世界善良的人们一致对于美方纵容李承晚匪帮强迫扣留我方被俘人员的挑衅行为表示激愤。社论说：这次事件甚至惹起了帝国主义阵营内部的不安和混乱。事件是严重的，但问题很简单。如果美方还有实现停战的诚意的话，那就应该早日收拾它自己所造成的这个事件。捷克斯洛伐克和波兰报纸
    谴责美方不采取步骤防止这件事
    【新华社布拉格二十三日电】捷克斯洛伐克“人民防线报”在二十一日的世界局势评论栏中写道，李承晚“释放”大批战俘的行动，是“企图破坏和平的、最糟糕的、毫无信义的挑衅行为”。“人民防线报”说，尽管李承晚常常公开主张不惜用一切办法继续战争，美方还是不曾设法防止这一事件，所以，“李承晚匪帮这种横蛮的背信举动的全部责任，无疑落在美国军事当局、联合国军司令部和美国政府身上”。“人民防线报”最后说：“世界舆论一致谴责李承晚的挑衅行动，并谴责美国占领当局不曾采取任何步骤来防止这一件事。”
    波兰各报都登载了金日成元帅、彭德怀将军给克拉克的信，和李承晚匪帮连续强迫扣留战俘的消息。“人民论坛报”发表了一篇题为“李承晚挑衅的意义和走向朝鲜停战的道路”的文章。文章说，这种挑衅在许多国家里引起了极大的愤慨。文章着重指出，李承晚不可能是瞒着美国当局做出这种无耻的破坏事情来的。该报说，金日成元帅和彭德怀将军给克拉克的信中提出的要求，表达了各国人民为真正结束朝鲜战争，签订并执行停战协定所作的一贯努力。该报说，“鉴于南朝鲜军队归‘联合国军司令部’统辖的事实，‘联合国军司令部’能够而且必须对它属下的所有军队包括南朝鲜军队在内的破坏停战协定的行为负责。”
       “华沙生活报”谈到李承晚最近的挑衅行动时说，这件事情是当着他的美国主子眼前，并且是在实现停战的条件差不多都要具备了的时候干出来的。美国傀儡李承晚的这种挑衅行动，是国际关系史上前所未有的。这个行动被许多国家公开称为“破坏行动”。“华沙生活报”最后说，挑衅者和无耻的战争贩子使他们自己陷于孤立，使他们自己在全体人类中陷于政治上和道义上孤立的地位。全印和平理事会主席克其鲁
    指出李匪扣押战俘是要继续战争
    【新华社新德里二十三日电】全印和平理事会主席赛福丁·克其鲁博士号召印度各地所有的和平委员会都在六月二十五日举行集会，要求在朝鲜实现和平，并提出这样口号：“必须尊重国际协议；必须遣返战俘并签订停战协定”。
    克其鲁博士六月二十二日在新德里发表声明说，各国人民本来都希望能在六月二十五日庆祝朝鲜和平的实现和屠杀、毁灭人类生命与福利的战争的结束。但李承晚却释放了二万五千名以上的战俘，故意地破坏停战谈判。这种行为是闻所未闻的，并且只有一个目的——使战争继续下去。
    “自从停战在望以来，在过去数天中，李承晚一再地威胁要破坏谈判。很明显，如果当初在李承晚宣布他的意图时，联合国军司令部采取适当步骤，他原不可能采取这种带来严重后果的步骤。
    “但是，除了发表一些姑息的言论和作出一些关于军事条约与援助的诺言外，美国政府竟对他毫不加约束。因此，联合国军司令部决不能推卸它未能采取适当步骤阻止李承晚实现其威胁的责任，特别是当南朝鲜军队在联合国军控制下的时候。”
    克其鲁博士强调指出：“现在是时候了，普通人民应该用明白无误的声音说明，如果要赢得并维持和平，就必须尊重和保持国际协议。”印度和巴基斯坦报纸指出
    美方必须追回被“释放”的战俘
    【新华社新德里二十三日电】印度和巴基斯坦报纸广泛评论李承晚企图破坏停战谈判的挑衅行为，认为美国应对这个行为负责任。
       “印度时报”在二十二日以“拯救停战”为题发表社论说：“局势要求我们以全力拯救停战。没有理由期望共产党把二万六千名北朝鲜战俘被释放作为不可避免的事而予以接受。必须尽一切力量追回被释放的战俘。”社论说：“除了战俘问题之外，联军司令部也有责任保证将前往南朝鲜管理战俘的中立国军队的安全。”
       “国民先驱报”二十日的社论说：“六月八日关于战俘遣返问题的协议受到全世界的欢呼，认为它扫除了朝鲜停战与和平的最后的严重障碍。但是李承晚却将有关的战俘大批加以释放，这就使得这个协议变得毫无用处。”社论说，李承晚企图破坏朝鲜停战谈判的行动，“证实了三年前朝鲜战争爆发时许多人所抱的见解，即真正的侵略者是南朝鲜而不是共产党北朝鲜。李承晚居然认为用军事力量来战胜中国和北朝鲜人是可能的，从这方面看来，李承晚在最近三年中并没有取得丝毫教训。”社论说，“对于李承晚的这个谜的唯一解释，似乎只能是：李承晚不仅代表着他自己，而且代表着美国共和党的某些有势力人物，这些人物害怕和平的到来，因此就下定决心来阻挡这个灾难。”
    “印度斯坦旗报”二十日的社论说：“必须对全世界解释的是，为什么在朝鲜的联合国军司令部不知道这样的一件事。”但是，如果“就像李承晚所暗示的那样，那么联合国军司令部一定早已发觉李承晚要不顾战俘遣返协议而采取行动的计划。事实上，李承晚本人说过，‘凡是我曾与之谈起我们希望释放战俘的联合国军当局人士，大多数都是同情我们的’。因此，如果联合国军司令部确是纵容南朝鲜在一夜之内释放战俘达二万五千多名的话，那将是非常可耻的。”
    “自由报”二十一日以“美国政府应当负责”为题发表社论说：如果没有美方的纵容，李承晚集团是不可能进行这样的破坏活动的。
    “新世纪报”二十一日的社论说：“这种行动已经把李承晚及其美国主子们的真正意图，以及他们的丑恶阴谋完全暴露在全世界人的眼前。”“假使李承晚的美国主子们认为把全部责任都推在李承晚的头上就可以逃脱全部的罪状，那他们是想错了。”
    “巴基斯坦时报”二十日以“破坏了和平前途”为题发表社论说：“表面上看来也像言之有理的所谓联合国军司令部对于这个事件从头到尾都毫不知情的说法，似乎是经不起仔细推敲的。”
    “今天报”二十一日的社论说：假使说美国没有纵容李承晚集团，那么“他们那样迟疑不决而不对李承晚采取严格的行动，和不去维护他们自己代表们所签过字的协议，就讲不通了”。英国混合机器工会设菲尔德车间代表
    要求制止破坏朝鲜谈判的行动
    【新华社二十三日讯】塔斯社伦敦二十二日讯：“工人日报”报道，混合机器工会设菲尔德车间代表的季会，要求英国政府尽力使李承晚集团或美国不负责任的人士不可能再干出任何进一步破坏朝鲜停战谈判的行动。
    会议敦促混合机器工会会员加倍努力争取和平，尤其是关于朝鲜问题和关于举行大国会议以及迅速扩展东西方之间贸易的问题。瑞士报纸发表评论
    认为美方应对这事件负全部责任
    【新华社二十三日讯】伯尔尼消息：瑞士舆论谴责李承晚匪帮强迫扣留战俘的挑衅行为，并且认为美军司令部应该对这一事件负全部责任。
    “人民权利报”在十九日发表评论说，这是一件恶劣的事，完全可能成为对停战的真正破坏。这一事件的责任完全应由联合国军司令部担负。该报说，既然联合国军司令部已经不顾南朝鲜的怠工与反对，继续进行了谈判，并且签订了关于战俘问题的协议，而且承认南朝鲜军队也在它的指挥之下，那末，它就有责任使这些协议得到遵守。该报指出，李承晚这样“释放”战俘，是赤裸裸的破坏协议的行为。美国人说他们不知道南朝鲜的这个计划，这决不能成为被原谅的理由。因为南朝鲜政府宣布过要释放战俘。该报认为，美国人有责任采取措施，但是他们没有这样做。
    “洛桑日报”在同一天发表社论说，李承晚“释放”战俘的行为，可能在朝鲜谈判和战争的前途上引起极严重的后果。该报指出，朝中方面在这个问题上的发言是明确的。该报说，联合国军司令部和美国政府不可能负担起南朝鲜政府及其军队的行动的责任的事实，确定了所发生的事件的严重性。许多国家的报纸
    要求把李承晚赶下台去
    【新华社二十三日讯】许多国家的舆论要求将李承晚赶下台去，以保障协议的履行和朝鲜停战的实现。
    英国“每日邮报”说：假使停战不能实现，“这就是李承晚的罪行所产生的罪大恶极的结果。他已经显示出他是不可靠的。必须由其他富有责任感的人来代替他的职务。假使必要的话，应该把它的全部政府都赶下台去”。该报说，美国证明诚意的最好办法就是抛弃李承晚。英国广播公司评论员盖·伊顿说：“一个工党议员甚至说，只要李承晚在南朝鲜执政一天，协议就一天不可能达成。又有人建议，由联合国宣布南朝鲜处于紧急状态，以使撤换政府一事成为可能。”英国下议院工党议员怀阿特和唐纳利都要求逮捕或监禁李承晚及其整个内阁成员。
    “印度时报”说：“局势要求我们以全力拯救停战，……必须尽一切力量追回被释放的战俘。必须以给予最重惩罚，包括在必要时立即把李承晚撤职的威胁来迫使南朝鲜政府在这个工作中进行合作。”“德里快报”说：“如果李承晚仍然顽固不化，那就应该立即把他撤到不能再来捣蛋的地位上去。”
    据法新社报道，“接近联合国亚洲代表团的人士担心目前板门店谈判的中断可能变为最后的破裂。人们认为避免破裂的唯一办法，是采取激烈的步骤剥夺李承晚握有的政府权力。”某些西方驻联合国代表团人士认为，“应该叫李承晚在两条道路中任择其一，一条是完全服从联合国的命令，另一条是解除职务。”
    东京“时事新报”在二十一日也“建议美国撤掉那个一意孤行的独裁者李承晚”。
