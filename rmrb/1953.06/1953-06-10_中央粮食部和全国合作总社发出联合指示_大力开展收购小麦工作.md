Xinhua News Agency, June 9th—The Central People's Government Ministry of Food and the All-China Federation of Cooperatives jointly issued a directive on June 8 regarding the procurement of wheat. The directive stated: From now on, grain procurement is a political task for the national food departments and cooperative systems. The principle of vigorous procurement should be implemented to ensure that commodity grain procurement accounts for approximately 80% of the market supply.

The directive said: It is a basic requirement of farmers in wheat-producing areas to sell the wheat they want to sell at reasonable prices and buy coarse grains, rice, and other means of production and consumer goods (especially means of production). Vigorously carrying out procurement work is, on the one hand, to meet this requirement of farmers, and on the other hand, to ensure the needs of urban industry and ensure the smooth progress of national economic construction. This year, due to the disaster in some wheat-producing areas, disaster victims are bound to sell wheat to buy coarse grains to survive the famine, which increases the task of the grain departments and cooperatives to purchase wheat and supply coarse and fine grains.

The directive pointed out the conditions for completing this year's wheat procurement work: Last year, the wheat planting area was expanded, and this spring, the state adjusted the price ratio of cotton and grain and cloth, and relatively increased the price of wheat, reducing the price difference between industrial and agricultural products to a considerable extent. State-owned grain companies and cooperative organizations are more common in various regions, and all aspects have considerable strength. These provide practical possibilities and necessary conditions for expanding wheat procurement. However, procurement work must also be coordinated with industrial and commercial administrative departments to strengthen grain market management, correctly grasp grain price policies, and do a good job in the supply of means of production and consumer goods, and give play to the cotton purchasing experience in order to complete the procurement task.

The directive pointed out to the cadres of the grain departments: If the state wants to do a good job in grain purchasing and marketing, it must rely on cooperatives and make full use of the strength of cooperatives. In the procurement process, it should provide as much assistance as possible to cooperatives in terms of inspection technology and other aspects. Cadres of the cooperative system must clearly recognize ideologically that to complete the task of wheat procurement entrusted by the state, they must closely integrate with grain companies, strengthen education for members, combine supply work to give play to the strength of cooperatives, and purchase the wheat sold by farmers in a timely manner. In the procurement process, every effort should be made to reduce procurement expenses, and phenomena of not seriously calculating and wasting state funds should be resolutely opposed.

The directive raised several issues to be noted in the procurement work. First, before procurement, each region must find out the true situation of this year's wheat production (including the area planted and the amount on the market), and formulate procurement plans for the grain departments and cooperatives accordingly. The grain department should formulate transportation, transfer, and other plans for the supply of coarse grains in accordance with the proportion of procurement agreed upon by both parties; the cooperative should formulate plans for fertilizers, farm tools, and the supply of consumer goods in conjunction with state-owned trade. Only with sufficient supply can the purpose of procurement be achieved. Secondly, in order to correctly implement the policy of grading and pricing, it is necessary to improve inspection technology in procurement. The grain department and the cooperative should jointly agree on reasonable grading standards and take unified steps. At an appropriate time, in conjunction with the local central work, farmers should be educated to dry and winnow the wheat so that it can be graded and priced. At the same time, strengthen the organization and management of procurement stations. Local grain departments and cooperatives should establish a joint inspection system to systematically inspect the work of several procurement stations and gain experience.

### 中央粮食部和全国合作总社发出联合指示  大力开展收购小麦工作

    中央粮食部和全国合作总社发出联合指示
    大力开展收购小麦工作
    【新华社九日讯】中央人民政府粮食部和中华全国合作社联合总社在六月八日发出关于收购小麦的联合指示。这个指示说：今后收购粮食是国家粮食部门和合作社系统的政治任务，应贯彻大力收购的方针，保证完成商品粮收购占上市量百分之八十左右。
    指示说：农民在合理的价格下，卖出要卖的小麦，买得粗粮、大米及其他生产资料和生活资料（特别是生产资料），是产麦区农民的基本要求。大力开展收购工作，一方面是为了满足农民的这种要求，另一方面也是为了保障城市工业的需要，保证国家经济建设的顺利进行。今年由于部分产麦区遭受了灾荒，灾民为度荒势必卖出小麦，换购粗粮，因而就加重了粮食部门和合作社收购小麦和供应粗粮和细粮的任务。
    指示说到完成今年收购小麦工作的条件时指出：去年小麦播种面积扩大，今春国家又调整了棉粮和纱布的比价，并将小麦价格相对提高，相当的缩小了工农产品的差价。国营粮食公司和合作社在各地的组织机构较普遍，各方面都具备相当的力量。这些就提供了扩大收购小麦的实际可能和必要的条件。但是，收购工作还必须配合工商行政部门加强粮食市场管理，正确的掌握粮价政策，并须作好生产资料和生活资料的供应工作，发挥收棉经验，才能完成收购任务。
    这个指示向粮食部门的干部指出：国家要作好粮食的购销工作，必须依靠合作社，充分运用合作社的力量；在收购中，对合作社在检验技术方面及其他方面，应尽量给以帮助。合作社系统的干部，必须从思想上明确认识：要完成国家委托的收购小麦的任务，必须与粮食公司密切结合，加强对社员的教育，结合供应工作发挥合作社的力量，把农民出卖的小麦，适时地收购起来。并在收购中尽量降低收购开支，坚决反对不认真核算、浪费国家资财的现象。
    指示中提出了关于收购工作要注意的几个问题。首先是各地区在收购以前，要摸清今年小麦生产的真实情况（包括植麦面积和上市量），据此制定粮食部门和合作社的收购计划。粮食部门应按照双方已定的收购比重，制定供应粗粮的运输、调运等计划；合作社应制定肥料、农具及结合国营贸易供应生活资料的计划。只有充分供应，才能达到收购的目的。其次，为正确的贯彻分等论价政策，就要提高收购中的检验技术，粮食部门和合作社共同商定合理的评级标准，采取统一的步调。并在适当时机结合当地的中心工作，教育农民将麦子晒干扬净，以便评级论价。同时，加强收购站的组织和管理工作。各地粮食部门和合作社要建立联合检查制度，系统地检查几个收购站的工作，取得经验。
