    Inspire the Masses to Strive for Increased Grain Production to Overcome Disasters
    The issue of increasing grain production is fundamental to the rural economy. The Central Committee has instructed Party committees and people's governments at all levels, as well as all departments related to rural work, to make increasing grain production and disaster relief the overriding central tasks in our rural work. Therefore, provincial newspapers, especially those in disaster-stricken areas, should focus on publicizing and reporting on the efforts of farmers to overcome disasters and increase grain production.
    According to a recent review of newspapers in some disaster-stricken areas, such as Hubei Daily, Hebei Daily, Henan Daily, and Anhui Daily, since March, these newspapers have made the following efforts in reporting on disaster relief and increased production, based on the specific drought, flood, wind, insect, frost, and hail disasters in their respective areas: First, they implemented the policy that disaster relief and increased grain production are the current overriding central tasks in rural areas. Besides repeatedly publishing emergency directives from the provincial governments and editorials demanding that leaders at all levels make production and disaster relief the overriding central task, fully lead farmers in overcoming disasters such as waterlogging, drought, wind, frost, insects, and hail, strive to reduce losses as much as possible, and oppose any ideas of paralysis, hesitation, or waiting; after widespread rainfall in mid-May, it was also proposed that we cannot be paralyzed and optimistic because of the rain, but must seize the time to rush planting, replanting, check seedlings, protect seedlings, and supplement seedlings to ensure that all autumn fields are sown and strive for increased production of major autumn crops. Newspapers promptly put forward tasks as the disaster situation changed, which pointed out the direction of efforts for cadres and the masses. Many newspapers also explained working methods, reported that leading organs at all levels dispatched a large number of cadres to the disaster areas, and emphasized that leading disaster relief work must follow the mass line, oppose bureaucracy, oppose decentralism, and oppose coercion and commandism. For example, the "Commentary on Rural Work" in Anhui Daily on May 22 used the different work styles of Jiang Siying, a female village head of Zhu Zhuang Village in Caomiao Township, Sihong County, and Zhang Zuoliang, a district head of Wudian District, Fengyang County, and the resulting different work outcomes, to illustrate the harm of numb and insensitive bureaucracy to disaster relief and increased production work. It should be pointed out that in the face of disasters, cadres at all levels should actively and proactively care for the masses, share weal and woe with the people, and lead the masses to overcome disasters. This is a prerequisite for making disaster relief and increased production the current overriding central task, and it is also an important aspect of newspapers to inspire farmers' enthusiasm for production.
    Secondly, they generally paid attention to educating farmers through typical examples of "self-reliance through production" and "man can conquer nature" to overcome temporary pessimism and despair and inspire their enthusiasm for production. In addition to expounding the principles of "self-reliance through production" and "man can conquer nature" and various favorable conditions for overcoming natural disasters in editorials, these newspapers used typical living examples or historical recollections and other methods of mass education to prove that natural disasters can be completely overcome. For example, the "Propagandist's Speech" in Anhui Daily on May 3 used the historical facts of overcoming the great flood in 1950 to encourage farmers to overcome disasters. Another example is the report in Henan Daily on May 8 on the farmers of Baicun Township, Yanshi County, "establishing confidence in overcoming the famine after checking the situation and calculating carefully," which also profoundly reflected how the farmers of Baicun Township changed from panic to stability and from being helpless to actively engaging in self-reliance through production. The report explained that after the township expanded cadre meetings and village-level mass forums to discuss "What is self-reliance through production?" "Why should we engage in self-reliance through production?" "Can we engage in self-reliance through production?" "How can we engage in self-reliance through production?" the farmers' ideological concerns were fundamentally resolved, their negative and pessimistic emotions were changed, and production self-reliance plans were made according to the different situations of each person. Guo Liangyou's family of five, a severely affected household, planned to spend the summer famine by growing melons and vegetables, carrying and selling sweet potato seedlings, women weaving cloth, and children accumulating wild vegetables, and strive for increased autumn grain production. The newspaper also criticized the idea of relying on government relief in its report on May 21. These reports played a certain positive role in overcoming the pessimism of the masses and establishing the idea of "self-reliance through production" and "man can conquer nature."
    Thirdly, these newspapers also paid attention to reporting on how to help farmers overcome difficulties in production materials and the manpower and material support from various organs and strata to the disaster areas. The most important issue in solving the difficulties of production materials for farmers in disaster areas is the supply of fertilizer and free lending. In addition to reporting on the supply of grain and seeds, Henan Daily and other newspapers paid more attention to reporting on the supply of fertilizer and free lending. For example, the report in the newspaper on April 13 on the active supply of fertilizer by the Tangyin and Anyang Wuguan Joint Village Supply and Marketing Cooperative, the criticism on April 6 and 8 of the bureaucratic style of the supply and marketing cooperatives and the People's Bank of China's agricultural loan work in Tongxu, Kaocheng, Wenxian and other places being slow and stockpiling fertilizer, and the reports on May 9 and 19 on the implementation of the free lending policy in Fuhe Township, Xinyang County, and other places to activate rural lending relations, etc., were relatively concentrated and prominent. Another issue in solving the difficulties of production materials for farmers in disaster areas is for farmers to engage in sideline production, and for trade cooperation departments to carry out material exchange work and actively help farmers open up sales channels for local specialties. Many newspapers also paid attention to reporting on this aspect. Southern Daily and Anhui Daily, based on the characteristics of their respective regions, reported on the examples of mutual assistance and mutual aid, such as the savings of cadres and troops stationed in Guangdong Province to assist in disaster relief and rescue, the conservation of funds by Huaihe River workers to support, and the transportation workers transporting grain to support. Newspapers publicized ways to overcome the difficulties of farmers' production materials from all aspects according to the specific conditions of various places, which not only helps to increase farmers' investment in reproduction, but also further strengthens the political and economic ties between organs, troops and the local people.
    Finally, many newspapers discovered and promoted the methods and creations of farmers to overcome the difficulties of production and disaster relief, based on the principle of adapting to local conditions and using local materials. For example, the typical experiences of "Situation and Experience of Drought Resistance and Rice Transplanting in Huanggang Special Zone," "Report of the Xishui County Committee of the Communist Party of China on the Method of 'Moving Seedlings' for Drought Resistance and Seedling Protection of Rice," "Experience on the Current Problem of Weeding and Seedling Protection" and "Situation and Experience of Drought Resistance in Xiangyang Special Zone" continuously published by Hubei Daily on May 19, 26 and 27 are all local Party committees or governments that have conducted in-depth investigations and research, concentrated the rich experience of local farmers in drought resistance and seedling protection for decades, and summarized and improved them. Therefore, once these experiences are publicized in the newspaper, they can be adopted by a wider area. Hebei Daily did a better job in discovering and promoting the creations of the masses. Since October last year, Hebei Daily has continuously promoted and summarized the experience of the water drill [Note]. In October, Hebei was experiencing a drought, and Hebei Daily paid great attention to promoting advanced experience in drought resistance. Therefore, after receiving the manuscript from Dawangzhuang, Wuqiang County, on the creation of the water drill, the newspaper studied it with relevant departments and believed that the water drill was an economical and effective tool for sowing wheat in arid areas. Therefore, on October 4, while publishing this news, the editor's note pointed out that this creation was of great significance for drought-resistant wheat planting and hoped that all localities would pay attention to its promotion. After this creation was announced in the newspaper, it attracted the attention of cadres and the masses in various places. Yin Huacheng, secretary of the Yinjiaxiang branch of the Communist Party of China in Xingtai County, actively studied the method of manufacturing water drills and made further improvements. After he successfully trial-produced it, he not only overcame the conservative ideas of some cadres and promoted it in the whole township, but also was adopted by more than 20 villages. This spring, Hebei was threatened by drought again, and the newspaper sent comrades from the Xingtai Special Zone reporter station to Yinjiaxiang to investigate the actual effect of water drill wheat planting, which confirmed that the effect was very good. The newspaper then compiled and published the experience of promoting water drill sowing in the third district of Xingtai County on March 26. This aroused even more attention in various places. For example, the experience of Dingxing County in imitating the water drill in Yinjiaxiang was further improved. Originally, water was applied in the morning and seeds were sown in the afternoon. After the transformation, water and seeds were mixed together for sowing. This can save a lot of labor. In order to promote this experience, the leaders of Laishui County rushed to make water drills overnight and asked cadres from various districts to study in the county so that they could be widely promoted. The effect of using water drill sowing proved to be more seedling-protecting than rushing to plant in the moisture. Therefore, the creation and promotion of water drills played a great role in mobilizing the masses to fight drought and sow. Now many areas of the province are using water drills to fight drought and sow. In addition to promoting water drills, Hebei Daily also successively promoted the lightweight waterwheel and siphon (which can solve the difficulty of watering land that is too high or too low along the canal), created by Yang Xishan in Mafang Village and Jia Xiaowa in Beiguan Village, Jin County, the method of digging quicksand wells in Fengrun County, the hydraulic waterwheel created in Fengnan County, and the pedal waterwheel in Xingtai Special Zone. These experiences effectively guided and promoted the local struggle against drought and seedling protection. Under the attack of natural disasters, the role of agricultural technology guidance is very important. The initiative of Hebei Daily and Hubei Daily in promoting mass creations "locally and according to local conditions" is worth advocating.
    What plays a decisive role in the struggle to overcome natural disasters and increase grain production is: the level of enthusiasm of farmers for production. And "the key to raising farmers' enthusiasm for production is to implement policies. This is mainly the policy of protecting farmers' land ownership, the policy of implementing reasonable burdens, reducing and exempting taxes according to law, and not increasing taxes for increased production." (See the editorial "Strengthening the Work of Increasing Grain Production and Disaster Relief" in this newspaper on May 17). Therefore, if we ignore the key issue of policy publicity and only carry out publicity from the aspects of the center of work, leadership style, education on "man can conquer nature," and helping farmers overcome difficulties in production materials, etc., it is not enough. The reports of newspapers on disaster relief and increased production (and the reports of other work should also be like this) must also, as Lenin instructed, "be good at finding a special link on the chain at every moment" ("Selected Works of Lenin," two-volume collection, Chinese edition of the Moscow Foreign Language Publishing House, Volume 2, page 403), that is, seize the "special link" of fully publicizing the Party's policies to improve farmers' enthusiasm for production. Only by seizing this "special link" can the reports on overcoming disasters and increasing grain production have full publicity and educational effects and organizational and driving roles, and thereby strengthen the ideological and mass nature of the newspaper. In this regard, the report of Hubei Daily can be taken as an example. From May 7 to 24, Hubei Daily, in the special column "Publicity Materials on Ten Measures for Carrying out the Patriotic Grain Increase Movement in Agriculture," combined with the local situation to explain in popular terms the protection of farmers' private ownership, guaranteeing freedom of lending, actively and steadily carrying out the mutual aid and cooperation movement, correctly implementing agricultural tax policies, strengthening credit and supply and marketing cooperation, and promoting the development of industrial and agricultural products. In the special column "Consolidating Mutual Aid Teams by Implementing the Principle of Voluntary Mutual Benefit" from May 21 to 23, the newspaper successively published the interviews of two famous mutual aid team leaders in Qichun County, Gao Yinyu and Li Gui'er (female)——"25 Questions and Answers on Mutual Aid Teams." Fighting against various natural disasters is a long-term and important task. On the one hand, our newspapers should study the laws of local natural disasters, educate the masses to establish the idea of long-term disaster prevention and relief, prepare in advance, and be able to rescue in time when disasters occur; on the other hand, we should study and summarize the experience of natural disaster reporting, and raise the ideological level of disaster relief and increased production reporting a step further, so as to better inspire the masses to strive for increased grain production to overcome disasters.

专栏：报纸工作述评

    鼓舞群众为战胜灾害增产粮食而奋斗
    增产粮食问题是农村经济中的基本问题。中央曾指示各级党委、人民政府和一切与农村工作有关的部门，都要把增产粮食和救灾工作做为我们在农村中压倒一切的中心工作。因而各省级报纸特别是受灾地区的报纸就应注重宣传报道农民努力战胜灾害和增产粮食的问题。
    据最近对一些受灾地区报纸的检查，湖北日报、河北日报、河南日报、安徽日报等，曾根据当地所受旱、涝、风、虫、霜、雹等灾害不同情况，从三月份开始，对救灾增产报道作了以下的努力：首先，贯彻了救灾工作和增产粮食是当前农村中压倒一切的中心任务的方针。各该报除多次发表了所在地省政府的紧急指示和社论，要求各级领导把生产救灾工作做为压倒一切的中心工作，全力领导农民战胜水、旱、风、霜、虫、雹等灾害，争取少减产，反对任何麻痹、犹疑、等待思想；五月中旬普遍降雨后，又提出不能因落雨而麻痹乐观，必须抓紧抢种、补种、查苗、保苗、补苗，保证全部秋田下种，争取大秋作物的增产。报纸随着灾害情况的变化，及时提出任务，这就为干部群众指明努力方向。不少报纸还交代了工作方法，报道了各级领导机关抽派大批干部深入灾区，以及领导救灾工作必须走群众路线，反对官僚主义、反对分散主义、反对强迫命令。如安徽日报五月二十二日“农村工作述评”中，就以泗洪县曹庙乡祝庄村女村长蒋思英等和凤阳县武店区区长张作良等两种不同工作作风所产生的两种工作结果，说明麻木不仁的官僚主义，对救灾增产工作的危害性。应该指出，在灾情面前，各级干部都应积极而主动地关心群众，与人民同甘苦，并带领群众，战胜灾荒。这是将救灾增产工作做为当前压倒一切的中心任务的先决条件，也是报纸用以启发农民生产积极性的一个重要方面。
    其次，一般地都注意了通过“生产自救”、“人定胜天”的典型事例，来教育农民，克服暂时的悲观失望情绪，启发其生产的积极性。各该报除在社论中阐述了“生产自救”、“人定胜天”的道理和战胜自然灾害的各种有利条件外，并以典型的活人活事或历史回忆等群众教育群众的方法，来证明自然灾害是完全能够克服的。如安徽日报五月三日
    “宣传员讲话”中，以一九五○年战胜大水灾的历史事实，鼓舞农民战胜灾害。又如河南日报五月八日刊载偃师县白村乡农民“经过查情况、算细账，树立了度荒信心”的报道中，也曾深刻地反映了白村乡农民如何由恐慌到稳定、由无办法到积极生产自救。报道中说明该乡经过扩大干部会和分村群众座谈会，讨论了“啥是生产自救？”“为啥要生产自救？”“到底能不能生产自救？”“怎样生产自救？”等问题后，从基本上解除了农民的思想顾虑，改变了消极悲观情绪，并根据各人不同情况，订出了生产自救计划。重灾户郭良友一家五口人，就打算以种瓜菜、担卖红薯秧、女人织布、小孩积野菜等办法，来度过夏荒，争取秋粮增产。该报在五月二十一日的报道中，还批判了依赖政府救济的思想。这些报道，对于克服群众悲观情绪，确立“生产自救”和“人定胜天”思想，都起了一定的积极作
    用。
    再次，各该报还注意报道了如何帮助农民克服生产资料的困难，以及各机关各阶层对灾区的人力物力支援。解决灾区农民生产资料困难最重要的问题，是肥料供应和自由借贷。河南日报等报除报道了粮食、种籽的供应外，更注意报道了肥料供应和自由借贷。如该报四月十三日对汤阴、安阳武官联村供销社积极供应肥料的报道，四月六日、八日对通许、考城、温县等地供销社、人民银行农贷工作拖拉和积压肥料的官僚主义作风的批评，以及五月九日、十九日对信阳县傅河乡等地贯彻自由借贷政策、活跃农村借贷关系的报道，等等，都是比较集中突出的。解决灾区农民生产资料困难的另一问题，是农民进行副业生产，以及贸易合作部门开展物资交流工作，积极帮助农民打开土特产的销路。不少报纸也都注意了这一方面的报道。南方日报、安徽日报更依据所在地区的特点，报道了广东全省机关干部和驻军节约救灾、协助群众抢险，以及淮河民工节资支援，和搬运工人运粮支援等等互助互济的事例。报纸根据各地具体情况从各方面宣传克服农民生产资料困难的办法，不仅有助于增加农民投资再生产的力量，并且可以由此进一步密切机关部队和当地人民在政治上和经济上的联系。
    最后，不少报纸曾根据就地取材、因地制宜的原则，发现和推广了农民克服生产救灾困难的办法和创造。如湖北日报五月十九日、二十六日、二十七日连续发表的“黄冈专区抗旱插秧情况和经验”、“中共浠水县委关于水稻‘掇秧’抗旱保苗方法的报告”、
    “关于当前薅脚保苗问题的经验”和“襄阳专区的抗旱情况和经验”等典型经验，都是当地党委或政府经过深入调查研究，集中了当地农民几十年抗旱保苗的丰富经验，加以总结和提高的。因而这些经验
    一经报纸宣传，它就能为广大地区所采用。在发现
    和推广群众的创造方面，河北日报做的更好。河北
    日报从去年十月以来，就曾不断地推广和总结了水
    耧〔注〕的经验。十月间，河北正逢天旱，河北日报就很注意推广抗旱的先进经验。因而该报在收到武强县大王庄创造水耧的来稿后，即与有关部门研究，认为水耧是在干旱地区播种小麦的经济又有效的工具。于是十月四日发表这一消息同时，便在编者按语中指明这一创造，对于抗旱种麦具有重要意义，希望各地重视推广。这一创造在报纸上公布后，引起各地干部群众的重视。邢台县中共尹贾乡支部书记尹化成，积极地研究了制造水耧的办法，并作了进一步的改良。经他试制成功后，不仅克服了一些干部的保守思想，在全乡得到推广，并且被二十几个村子所采用。今春河北又遭受旱灾威胁，该报即派邢台专区记者站的同志到尹贾乡调查水耧种麦的实际效果，证实效果很好。该报即在三月二十六日把邢台县三区推广水耧播种的经验整理发表。这就更加引起各地的重视。如定兴县仿制尹贾乡水耧的经验，又作了进一步的改良。原来是上午下水，下午下种，经过改造后，水和种籽渗在一起播种就行了。这样就可以节省许多劳动力。涞水县领导方面为推广这一经验，曾连夜赶制水耧，让各区干部到县上学习，以便普遍推广。使用水耧播种的效果证明，比抢墒播种更能保苗。因而水耧的创造和推广，在发动群众抗旱播种工作中起了很大作用。现在全省不少地区都使用水耧抗旱播种。除推广水耧外，河北日报在去年还先后推广了晋县马房村杨喜山和北关村贾小娃创造的轻便水车和虹吸管（可以解决沿渠地带过高过低不能浇水的困难），丰润县打流沙井的办法，丰南县创造的水力水车以及邢台专区的脚蹬水车等等经验。这些经验都有效地指导和推动了当地的抗旱保苗斗争。在自然灾害的袭击下，农业技术指导的作用是很大的。河北日报、湖北日报的这种“就地取材，因地制宜”推广群众创造的主动性，是值得提倡的。
    在战胜自然灾害和增产粮食的斗争中起着决定作用的是：农民生产积极性的高低。而“提高农民生产积极性的关键是贯彻政策。这主要是保护农民土地所有权的政策，是实行合理负担、依法减免、增产不增税的政策。”（见五月十七日本报社论：“加强增产粮食和救灾的工作”）。因此，如果忽视政策宣传这一关键问题，而仅仅从工作中心、领导作风、“人定胜天”教育和帮助农民克服生产资料困难等等方面，来进行宣传，还是不够的。报纸对于救灾增产工作的报道（其他工作的报道也应该如此），也要像列宁所指示的，“必须善于在每个时机里找出链条上的一个特别环节”（“列宁文选”两卷集，莫斯科外国文书籍出版局中文版，第二卷，第四○三页），即抓住充分地宣传党的政策这“一个特别环节”，来提高农民的生产积极性。只有抓住这“一个特别环节”，也才能使战胜灾害和增产粮食的报道具有充分的宣传教育作用和组织推动作用，并从而加强报纸的思想性群众性。在这一方面，可以湖北日报的报道为例。湖北日报从五月七日到二十四日在“开展农业爱国增产运动十项措施宣传材料”的专栏内，曾结合当地情况通俗地解释了保护农民私有权，保证借贷自由，积极而稳步地开展互助合作运动，正确贯彻农业税收政策，加强信用、供销合作，推动工农产品的发展等各项政策。五月二十一日到二十三日的“贯彻自愿互利原则整顿互助组”专栏内，又连续发表了蕲春县两位著名的互助组组长高荫余、李桂尔（女）的访问——“互助组问答二十五条”。和各种自然灾害作斗争是长时期的重要工作。我们报纸应一方面研究当地自然灾害的规律，教育群众树立长期防灾救灾的思想，事先做好准备，在灾害发生时能及时抢救；一方面研究和总结自然灾害报道的经验，把救灾增产报道的思想水平提高一步，以更好地鼓舞群众为战胜灾害增产粮食而奋斗。
