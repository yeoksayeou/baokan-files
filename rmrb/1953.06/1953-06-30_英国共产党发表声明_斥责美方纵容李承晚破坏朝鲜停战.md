Xinhua News Agency, Prague, June 29th. The British Communist Party issued a statement condemning the U.S. for condoning Syngman Rhee's sabotage of the Korean armistice and calling on the British people to take action to stop this criminal act. The statement was published in the "Daily Worker" in London on the 27th. The full text of the statement is as follows:

"The Korean War has entered its fourth year. The whole world is demanding an immediate ceasefire in Korea. The whole world is indignant at the heinous actions of Syngman Rhee, supported by the Americans, who is openly undermining peace and obstructing the armistice.

"After intimidating and massacring many of the Korean and Chinese prisoners of war under their guard, Syngman Rhee's guards and their American partners 'released' many of the remaining prisoners. They feared that the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, established under the terms of the agreement, would reveal the truth and the true wishes of the remaining prisoners. Therefore, Syngman Rhee and his partners secretly detained tens of thousands of prisoners of war in order to obstruct the implementation of the agreed terms regarding the repatriation of prisoners of war. U.S. officials disingenuously claim that they are not responsible for Syngman Rhee's actions and that they are unable to control their puppet. But as long as Syngman Rhee is maintained and supplied by the U.S., such claims will not deceive anyone.

"Everyone knows that without American economic support, Syngman Rhee would not be able to survive for a single day.

"Britain must not be further implicated in this criminal conspiracy of Syngman Rhee and his American masters.

"Now is the time to support Churchill's note to Syngman Rhee with positive action.

"Insist that the British government immediately and formally demand that the United States cease providing all support and supplies to Syngman Rhee and his clique.

"The British government should support Mr. Nehru's proposal for an immediate session of the United Nations General Assembly to discuss the Korean armistice crisis.

"Demand the immediate withdrawal of all British troops from Korea. British troops have no reason to remain in Korea any longer. The terms of the armistice have been agreed upon.

"The withdrawal of British troops from Korea will isolate and expose the true face of the American warmongers and their puppets, making it impossible for them to continue to act recklessly in the name of the United Nations.

"This will be the most powerful encouragement to the overwhelming majority of the American people who are demanding the withdrawal of all American troops from Korea.

"To achieve world peace, peace in Korea is an essential first step."

    英国共产党发表声明
    斥责美方纵容李承晚破坏朝鲜停战
    【新华社布拉格二十九日电】英国共产党发表声明，斥责美方纵容李承晚破坏朝鲜停战，号召英国人民行动起来制止这个罪恶行为。这个声明刊载在二十七日的伦敦“工人日报”上。声明全文如下：
    “朝鲜战争已经进入第四年。全世界都要求立刻在朝鲜停火。全世界对于美国人扶持的李承晚公开破坏和平、阻挠停战的罪恶行动都感到愤慨。
    李承晚的卫队和他们的美国伙伴在恐吓、屠杀了许多他们看管下的朝中战俘以后，又‘释放’了许多余下的战俘。他们担心根据协议的条款而设立的中立国委员会会揭露出事情的真相，以及余下的战俘的真正愿望。所以李承晚和它的伙伴把数万战俘秘密扣留起来，以阻挠双方协议的关于遣返战俘的条款的实现。美国官方骗人说，他们对李承晚的行动没有责任，又说什么他们没有能力控制他们的傀儡。但是只要李承晚一天仍由美国维持和供应，这种说法就一天骗不了人。
    谁都知道，没有美国人的经济支持，李承晚一天也维持不下去。
    英国决不要再牵连到李承晚和他的美国主子的这个罪恶阴谋里去。
    这是用积极行动来支持邱吉尔给李承晚的照会的时候了。
    坚持英国政府立即并正式要求美国停止给予李承晚和它的集团一切支持和供应。
    英国政府应该支持尼赫鲁先生的建议，要求立即召开联合国大会，以讨论朝鲜停战危机。
    要求立即自朝鲜撤回一切英国军队。英国军队没有任何理由再留在朝鲜。停战条款已经取得协议了。
    从朝鲜撤回英国军队会孤立并揭露美国战争制造者和他们的傀儡的真面目，使他们不能再假借联合国的名义胡作非为。
    这样，对于占压倒多数的美国人民提出的从朝鲜撤回一切美国军队的要求，将是最有力的鼓舞。
    要实现全世界的和平，朝鲜和平是必不可少的第一步。”
