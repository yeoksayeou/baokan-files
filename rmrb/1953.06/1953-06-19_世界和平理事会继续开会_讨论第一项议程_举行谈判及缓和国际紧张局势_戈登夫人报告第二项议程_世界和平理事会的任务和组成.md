    Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, June 18th: According to TASS, the morning session of the World Peace Council on the 17th was chaired by Guo Moruo. The meeting continued to discuss the first agenda item: "Holding Negotiations and Easing International Tensions". Mrs. Gordon also delivered a report on the second agenda item, "Tasks and Composition of the World Peace Council".

    Canadian writer Lillian Vinn and Nobel Prize winner in Chemistry, British biochemist Richard Synge, spoke successively, demanding consultations among major powers to achieve peace. Lillian Vinn suggested that writers, journalists, and scientists jointly write to the major powers, asking them to replace the spirit of war with the spirit of consultation. Richard Synge said: When proposing consultation suggestions, one cannot forget that the issue of prohibiting weapons of mass destruction has not yet been finally resolved. Therefore, all efforts must continue to be made to prevent the world from being dragged into a war that may use such weapons.

    World Peace Council member Vanda Vasilevska (USSR) spoke on the issue of cultural and scientific relations between countries. She said that the exchange of cultural and scientific achievements is a manifestation of friendship. In recent years, hundreds of foreign delegations have visited the Soviet Union, we have published millions of books by foreign authors, and hundreds of theaters have staged plays by foreign writers. However, we feel that this is not enough, especially because the desire for peace and friendly feelings are spreading more and more widely among people around the world. The Soviet delegation is authorized to announce at this session of the Peace Council that the broadest masses of the Soviet people hope to greatly expand cultural and scientific ties with other countries.

    Vasilevska concluded: Like you, I hope that millions of people can know each other, understand each other, and clearly recognize our people, our cities and villages, and our diverse cultures, rather than looking at these things through glasses of ignorance, prejudice, slander, and indifference. Prejudice can be used to incite hostility among people who do not understand each other, but no one can make friends strangle each other to death.

    French representative Ap√¥tre Depierre, who was invited to attend the meeting of the World Peace Council, revealed the aggressive nature of the "European Defense Community". He said that the French people are waging a tenacious struggle against the ratification of the "European Defense Community" treaty. Germany must never be allowed to become a second Korea. Holding a four-power conference is the only way to solve the German problem. We must use pressure to force our government to convene a four-power conference.

    Professor Ikuo Oyama, member of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council and Chairman of the Japanese Peace Committee, described the widespread peace movement in various parts of Japan. He emphasized that the Korean armistice is the first step in easing international tensions. This will remove the excuse for the United States to occupy Japan. He continued that if the Japanese people are not liberated from foreign rule and do not regain their freedom to decide their own destiny, Japan will remain a base for war in Asia.

    Oyama said that currently in Japan, the movement to strive for peace and independence is growing rapidly. The struggle to demand the abolition of the San Francisco Treaty, the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty, the Japan-U.S. Administrative Agreement, and to demand the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Japan and the elimination of U.S. war bases on Japanese territory has become a matter of common concern for all Japanese people. Similarly, the people's movement against the government's confiscation of farmland and fishing grounds to establish U.S. war bases has also gained the support of the entire population.

    Oyama pointed out: The demand to restore normal diplomatic and trade relations with China and the Soviet Union is gaining more and more support among the Japanese people. The Japanese people do not want to fight against the Asian people. They are eager to maintain friendly relations with all the people of Asia and the Pacific region, especially with the people of China and the Soviet Union.

    Oyama concluded: International disputes must be resolved peacefully and international tensions eased through consultations between the five major powers. Only then can the Japanese people's wish be realized -- that Japan move from the war camp to the peace camp.

    World Peace Council member Mrs. Gordon delivered a report on the second agenda item, "Tasks and Composition of the World Peace Council". Mrs. Gordon said that the World Peace Council is a dynamic organization that supports all reasonable aspirations of the public, proposes all means to condemn the use of force, and promotes mutual consultation to enhance international cooperation and mutual respect for national independence. The peace movement must pay close attention to the situation and must teach the public how to use the situation to ensure that the spirit of consultation permeates everything.

    The task of the World Peace Council is to maintain constant contact with the people of all countries and to accurately inform them of all important events in the world. Therefore, the World Peace Council must continue to unite all honest people in its ranks, regardless of their political views, as long as they respect humanity, believe in their future, and hope to guarantee this future with the power of peace. The constituent members of the World Peace Council should be people who can offer independent opinions on important political and economic issues.

    Therefore, the members of the Council should include leaders from political circles, economists, lawyers, and scientists. It should also include men and women with literary and artistic talents who can explain the significance of things to the people. The World Peace Council should include missionaries of different faiths, because they are advisors to many men and women in the world.

    The Council should include representatives from trade unions, women's associations, and youth federations. Among these representatives there should be leaders, but especially there should also be workers, farmers, and housewives who can enrich our movement with the experience they have gained in their daily struggles. Finally, the nature of the Peace Council should be truly global. Since the peace movement originated in Paris in 1949, some historically significant things have happened in the world. The Chinese people have achieved liberation and are engaged in great peaceful construction. In other Asian countries, the heroic struggle for national independence continues. The great Indian people are working hard to strive for a peaceful solution to all the disputes that currently make mankind deeply uneasy. The spirit of striving for liberation has spread throughout Latin America. The African continent has also smelled the breath of innovation. Therefore, it is obvious that the composition of the World Peace Council should reflect the aspirations of people all over the world, and not just the aspirations of people on a certain continent.

    Mrs. Gordon pointed out that D'Astier de la Vigerie said in his speech at this meeting that the World Peace Council is not a conference of professors, nor is it a conference of diplomats. The World Peace Council draws its strength from the masses of the people. This will make people feel their own strength. In this regard, Mrs. Gordon emphasized that the people of all countries have great expectations for the United Nations and demand that it act in accordance with the principles of the Atlantic Charter.

    Finally, Mrs. Gordon, on behalf of the 140 million women belonging to the International Democratic Women's Federation and the women of various countries who sent representatives to the recent World Women's Congress in Copenhagen, paid tribute to the World Peace Council.

    Romanian representative Daniel Lopel and Chilean representative General Carlos Figala Montero then spoke, both pointing out that the peace movement should strive to restore the United Nations to its original purpose and become a truly global organization. Daniel Lopel said that the peace movement should strive for all fourteen countries with the right to join the United Nations to join, and strive for the United Nations to accept the People's Republic of China. Lopel also supported Vasilevska's suggestion to strengthen international cultural and scientific ties. He suggested convening an international conference of architects and construction workers, an international conference of physicians, and suggested holding various sports competitions.

    Pakistani representative and publisher of the "Pakistan Times" Mazhar Ali Khan emphasized that all disputes can be resolved through negotiation. He also said that the Pakistani people oppose any attempt to drag Pakistan into U.S. military plans and resist the conspiracies of all foreign aggressors.

    Elno, Chairman of the French Jacobin Club, who was invited to attend the meeting of the World Peace Council, said that he belongs to the Radical Socialist Party. He supported the proposal to launch a campaign for consultation. He said: We must make a decision, a decision that will broadly help to explain to the people the role and importance of the peace movement. More people will support this movement and the spirit of consultation it promotes.

    After World Peace Council member and Cuban writer Juan Marinello spoke, D'Astier de la Vigerie, on behalf of the Presidium of the Congress, moved the agenda for future work.

    The Presidium suggested: Organize a committee on general political issues to formulate the general principles of the movement to promote consultation. Organize a committee to formulate practical ways and means to carry out this movement and to consider the tasks of the World Peace Council. Organize a committee on cultural exchange issues.

    The Presidium also suggested that no plenary meeting be held on the 18th, and that the committees work separately. The plenary session should continue on the afternoon of June 19th.

    The Presidium's proposal was unanimously adopted.
     Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, June 17th: The World Peace Council continued its meeting on the afternoon of the 16th, chaired by Mrs. Gordon.

    The first speaker was World Peace Council member Eriberto Jara (Mexico). He said that Latin American countries are all invaded by U.S. monopoly capital. U.S. monopoly capital interferes in the affairs of Latin American countries in various forms. The rule of these monopoly capital prevents the economic development of Latin American countries and forces Latin American countries to conclude servile agreements. Hara concluded: Major powers must conclude a peace treaty to realize the aspirations of people all over the world.

    Chatur Narain Malaviya, a member of the Indian National Congress Party, said in his speech that the forward-looking policies adopted by the Soviet and Chinese governments have aroused good reactions all over the world. He continued: We, the Indian people, cannot but especially emphasize the issue of the Asian people who are struggling for national independence and freedom. Lasting peace will only be fully realized after the people of our neighboring countries have fully gained freedom. He pointed out that the oppression suffered by the colonial people is also becoming more and more serious. He talked about the unimaginable atrocities committed by foreign troops against the local people in Indochina and Malaya, the suppression of the struggle for national independence in Transjordan, Iran, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, etc., the establishment of military bases in the Near East, and the refusal to return the Suez Canal Zone to Egypt. He concluded that the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China are the best friends of national freedom and national self-determination, and therefore the best friends of world peace.

    Then Erenburg spoke. After reviewing the achievements of the peace movement, he said: The war forces do not feel that they have completely failed, but only that the upcoming armistice in Korea is their first major setback. They have not given up and still hope to regain their losses elsewhere. Some advocates of war hate agreements because they are greedy and insatiable, while others are obsessed with fanaticism, blind hatred of progress, and fear of the future. We see that the armistice in Korea has frightened Syngman Rhee, and the proposal for a peaceful agreement between major powers on the German issue has frightened Adenauer. The war forces are still exerting pressure, trying to influence the policies of certain countries. Of course, I don't want to exaggerate anything, but it would be naive to close our eyes to the desperate struggles of those who want war -- cold war or hot war. We must tirelessly work to make everyone know the truth. We must ensure that the voices of millions of people are spread more powerfully, and we must make governments pay attention to the peaceful will of the people, not the conspiracies of a small number of merchants or politicians.

    Erenburg said: People face many problems, especially the issue of their national sovereignty. Under the influence of public opinion, leaders of many countries have raised this issue in different ways.

    Whether in Buenos Aires or Rome, whether in Copenhagen or Rio de Janeiro, there are calls for the protection of sovereign independence everywhere.

    We, the Soviet people, hope for peace among all nations and all countries. We hope to achieve peace based on mutual respect and equality. I think everyone now recognizes that a sovereign country is threatened if it joins a military bloc, because only the strongest and richest countries decide everything in a military bloc. The fact that foreign military bases are built on the territory of many sovereign countries makes this danger even more serious. In this case, no sovereign country can be sure that it will not be dragged into war against its own will. The British newspapers are full of opposition to the attempt to drag Britain into hostile acts against China. In the recent Italian elections, the Italian people showed their disdain for those who were subservient and pursued war policies.

    Erenburg said: We, the fighters for peace, warmly support all proposals for gradual and universal disarmament under international supervision. We firmly oppose the troops of armed revanchists and the establishment of new troops that are nominally international institutions but are actually controlled by one country. We, the fighters for peace, must support all measures aimed at guaranteeing national sovereignty and protecting national security. We must support those in the public who, although not fighting alongside us for world peace, oppose the forces of war. We, the fighters for peace, have long been working to restore the United Nations to an institution that can ensure the security of all countries. In view of this, China should obtain the seat it rightfully deserves in the United Nations.

    Erenburg said: Concluding a peace treaty with a unified and peace-loving Germany will eliminate the danger of war in Europe. Germany must become
    a sovereign country, but its neighbors, no, all the people,
    must be guaranteed that the German spirit of revenge and aggression will not be revived. A peace-loving Germany must not join any military bloc or alliance against the people. As for the struggle of the people of Asia and Africa for independence, we, the fighters for peace, support the right of all peoples to independence and advocate for the resolution of all disputes through consultation.

    Erenburg concluded: We have passed the first stage, we cannot stop halfway. We must work harder to strive for peace, so that none of us will feel ashamed and blush when we see his children in Budapest, London, Moscow or New York.

    B√∂rhan, Secretary of the Argentine Peace Committee, said that the Argentine people are resolutely fighting against the policy of war. The peace movement in Argentina is constantly expanding. Argentine peace fighters firmly demand the development of normal economic relations with the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, because only through international cooperation and strengthening peace can Argentina's economic difficulties be eliminated.

    Stanis≈Çaw Kulczy≈Ñski, Polish representative and Deputy Speaker of the Polish Parliament, emphasized that the solution of the German problem is particularly important now that revanchist slogans have been raised again in West Germany and attempts are being made to restore the Wehrmacht. The struggle to strive for a four-power conference, restore German unity, and oppose war treaties is extremely important.

    Isabelle Blume (Belgium), a member of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council, said that the victories achieved in the struggle for peace and mutual understanding and some diplomatic steps have made this spring a season full of hope for all mankind. The new situation is the result of the active efforts of peace fighters under the leadership of the World Peace Council for four years.

    Blume then talked about the tasks and role of peace fighters, saying that they must ensure that the spirit of consultation triumphs over the use of force.

    New Sock, a famous Indian peace movement leader and member of parliament, talked about the peace movement in India. He said: I can say with certainty that India will not participate in a war against China or the Soviet Union. Our Indian delegation hopes to put forward a proposal that we know is in line with the wishes of the representatives attending the meeting. We hope to use the following words as the slogan of the Budapest Conference: On every issue that has caused the current disputes, consult, consult, and consult again! Our demand for major powers to conduct consultations should not be subject to any conditions or reservations. Any peaceful solution that can lead to peace, any peace proposal put forward by any party should be supported by us. Let us work hard in every country to make our governments do everything in their power to promote consultations that will bring peace to all mankind.

    The next speaker, D'Astier de la Vigerie, agreed with the suggestion of the Indian representative. He suggested that the conference consider this suggestion immediately.

    Gabriel D'Arboussier (Black Africa), Vice-Chairman of the World Peace Council, supported consultations aimed at easing the international situation. He said: The African people were very pleased to learn about the imminent realization of the Korean armistice.

    Representatives from Lebanon and Sweden also spoke at the meeting.
