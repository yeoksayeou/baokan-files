    Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, June 18th: According to TASS, the morning session of the World Peace Council on the 17th was chaired by Guo Moruo. The meeting continued to discuss the first agenda item: "Holding Negotiations and Easing International Tensions". Mrs. Gordon also delivered a report on the second agenda item, "Tasks and Composition of the World Peace Council".

    Canadian writer Lillian Vinn and Nobel Prize winner in Chemistry, British biochemist Richard Synge, spoke successively, demanding consultations among major powers to achieve peace. Lillian Vinn suggested that writers, journalists, and scientists jointly write to the major powers, asking them to replace the spirit of war with the spirit of consultation. Richard Synge said: When proposing consultation suggestions, one cannot forget that the issue of prohibiting weapons of mass destruction has not yet been finally resolved. Therefore, all efforts must continue to be made to prevent the world from being dragged into a war that may use such weapons.

    World Peace Council member Vanda Vasilevska (USSR) spoke on the issue of cultural and scientific relations between countries. She said that the exchange of cultural and scientific achievements is a manifestation of friendship. In recent years, hundreds of foreign delegations have visited the Soviet Union, we have published millions of books by foreign authors, and hundreds of theaters have staged plays by foreign writers. However, we feel that this is not enough, especially because the desire for peace and friendly feelings are spreading more and more widely among people around the world. The Soviet delegation is authorized to announce at this session of the Peace Council that the broadest masses of the Soviet people hope to greatly expand cultural and scientific ties with other countries.

    Vasilevska concluded: Like you, I hope that millions of people can know each other, understand each other, and clearly recognize our people, our cities and villages, and our diverse cultures, rather than looking at these things through glasses of ignorance, prejudice, slander, and indifference. Prejudice can be used to incite hostility among people who do not understand each other, but no one can make friends strangle each other to death.

    French representative Apôtre Depierre, who was invited to attend the meeting of the World Peace Council, revealed the aggressive nature of the "European Defense Community". He said that the French people are waging a tenacious struggle against the ratification of the "European Defense Community" treaty. Germany must never be allowed to become a second Korea. Holding a four-power conference is the only way to solve the German problem. We must use pressure to force our government to convene a four-power conference.

    Professor Ikuo Oyama, member of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council and Chairman of the Japanese Peace Committee, described the widespread peace movement in various parts of Japan. He emphasized that the Korean armistice is the first step in easing international tensions. This will remove the excuse for the United States to occupy Japan. He continued that if the Japanese people are not liberated from foreign rule and do not regain their freedom to decide their own destiny, Japan will remain a base for war in Asia.

    Oyama said that currently in Japan, the movement to strive for peace and independence is growing rapidly. The struggle to demand the abolition of the San Francisco Treaty, the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty, the Japan-U.S. Administrative Agreement, and to demand the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Japan and the elimination of U.S. war bases on Japanese territory has become a matter of common concern for all Japanese people. Similarly, the people's movement against the government's confiscation of farmland and fishing grounds to establish U.S. war bases has also gained the support of the entire population.

    Oyama pointed out: The demand to restore normal diplomatic and trade relations with China and the Soviet Union is gaining more and more support among the Japanese people. The Japanese people do not want to fight against the Asian people. They are eager to maintain friendly relations with all the people of Asia and the Pacific region, especially with the people of China and the Soviet Union.

    Oyama concluded: International disputes must be resolved peacefully and international tensions eased through consultations between the five major powers. Only then can the Japanese people's wish be realized -- that Japan move from the war camp to the peace camp.

    World Peace Council member Mrs. Gordon delivered a report on the second agenda item, "Tasks and Composition of the World Peace Council". Mrs. Gordon said that the World Peace Council is a dynamic organization that supports all reasonable aspirations of the public, proposes all means to condemn the use of force, and promotes mutual consultation to enhance international cooperation and mutual respect for national independence. The peace movement must pay close attention to the situation and must teach the public how to use the situation to ensure that the spirit of consultation permeates everything.

    The task of the World Peace Council is to maintain constant contact with the people of all countries and to accurately inform them of all important events in the world. Therefore, the World Peace Council must continue to unite all honest people in its ranks, regardless of their political views, as long as they respect humanity, believe in their future, and hope to guarantee this future with the power of peace. The constituent members of the World Peace Council should be people who can offer independent opinions on important political and economic issues.

    Therefore, the members of the Council should include leaders from political circles, economists, lawyers, and scientists. It should also include men and women with literary and artistic talents who can explain the significance of things to the people. The World Peace Council should include missionaries of different faiths, because they are advisors to many men and women in the world.

    The Council should include representatives from trade unions, women's associations, and youth federations. Among these representatives there should be leaders, but especially there should also be workers, farmers, and housewives who can enrich our movement with the experience they have gained in their daily struggles. Finally, the nature of the Peace Council should be truly global. Since the peace movement originated in Paris in 1949, some historically significant things have happened in the world. The Chinese people have achieved liberation and are engaged in great peaceful construction. In other Asian countries, the heroic struggle for national independence continues. The great Indian people are working hard to strive for a peaceful solution to all the disputes that currently make mankind deeply uneasy. The spirit of striving for liberation has spread throughout Latin America. The African continent has also smelled the breath of innovation. Therefore, it is obvious that the composition of the World Peace Council should reflect the aspirations of people all over the world, and not just the aspirations of people on a certain continent.

    Mrs. Gordon pointed out that D'Astier de la Vigerie said in his speech at this meeting that the World Peace Council is not a conference of professors, nor is it a conference of diplomats. The World Peace Council draws its strength from the masses of the people. This will make people feel their own strength. In this regard, Mrs. Gordon emphasized that the people of all countries have great expectations for the United Nations and demand that it act in accordance with the principles of the Atlantic Charter.

    Finally, Mrs. Gordon, on behalf of the 140 million women belonging to the International Democratic Women's Federation and the women of various countries who sent representatives to the recent World Women's Congress in Copenhagen, paid tribute to the World Peace Council.

    Romanian representative Daniel Lopel and Chilean representative General Carlos Figala Montero then spoke, both pointing out that the peace movement should strive to restore the United Nations to its original purpose and become a truly global organization. Daniel Lopel said that the peace movement should strive for all fourteen countries with the right to join the United Nations to join, and strive for the United Nations to accept the People's Republic of China. Lopel also supported Vasilevska's suggestion to strengthen international cultural and scientific ties. He suggested convening an international conference of architects and construction workers, an international conference of physicians, and suggested holding various sports competitions.

    Pakistani representative and publisher of the "Pakistan Times" Mazhar Ali Khan emphasized that all disputes can be resolved through negotiation. He also said that the Pakistani people oppose any attempt to drag Pakistan into U.S. military plans and resist the conspiracies of all foreign aggressors.

    Elno, Chairman of the French Jacobin Club, who was invited to attend the meeting of the World Peace Council, said that he belongs to the Radical Socialist Party. He supported the proposal to launch a campaign for consultation. He said: We must make a decision, a decision that will broadly help to explain to the people the role and importance of the peace movement. More people will support this movement and the spirit of consultation it promotes.

    After World Peace Council member and Cuban writer Juan Marinello spoke, D'Astier de la Vigerie, on behalf of the Presidium of the Congress, moved the agenda for future work.

    The Presidium suggested: Organize a committee on general political issues to formulate the general principles of the movement to promote consultation. Organize a committee to formulate practical ways and means to carry out this movement and to consider the tasks of the World Peace Council. Organize a committee on cultural exchange issues.

    The Presidium also suggested that no plenary meeting be held on the 18th, and that the committees work separately. The plenary session should continue on the afternoon of June 19th.

    The Presidium's proposal was unanimously adopted.
     Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, June 17th: The World Peace Council continued its meeting on the afternoon of the 16th, chaired by Mrs. Gordon.

    The first speaker was World Peace Council member Eriberto Jara (Mexico). He said that Latin American countries are all invaded by U.S. monopoly capital. U.S. monopoly capital interferes in the affairs of Latin American countries in various forms. The rule of these monopoly capital prevents the economic development of Latin American countries and forces Latin American countries to conclude servile agreements. Hara concluded: Major powers must conclude a peace treaty to realize the aspirations of people all over the world.

    Chatur Narain Malaviya, a member of the Indian National Congress Party, said in his speech that the forward-looking policies adopted by the Soviet and Chinese governments have aroused good reactions all over the world. He continued: We, the Indian people, cannot but especially emphasize the issue of the Asian people who are struggling for national independence and freedom. Lasting peace will only be fully realized after the people of our neighboring countries have fully gained freedom. He pointed out that the oppression suffered by the colonial people is also becoming more and more serious. He talked about the unimaginable atrocities committed by foreign troops against the local people in Indochina and Malaya, the suppression of the struggle for national independence in Transjordan, Iran, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, etc., the establishment of military bases in the Near East, and the refusal to return the Suez Canal Zone to Egypt. He concluded that the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China are the best friends of national freedom and national self-determination, and therefore the best friends of world peace.

    Then Erenburg spoke. After reviewing the achievements of the peace movement, he said: The war forces do not feel that they have completely failed, but only that the upcoming armistice in Korea is their first major setback. They have not given up and still hope to regain their losses elsewhere. Some advocates of war hate agreements because they are greedy and insatiable, while others are obsessed with fanaticism, blind hatred of progress, and fear of the future. We see that the armistice in Korea has frightened Syngman Rhee, and the proposal for a peaceful agreement between major powers on the German issue has frightened Adenauer. The war forces are still exerting pressure, trying to influence the policies of certain countries. Of course, I don't want to exaggerate anything, but it would be naive to close our eyes to the desperate struggles of those who want war -- cold war or hot war. We must tirelessly work to make everyone know the truth. We must ensure that the voices of millions of people are spread more powerfully, and we must make governments pay attention to the peaceful will of the people, not the conspiracies of a small number of merchants or politicians.

    Erenburg said: People face many problems, especially the issue of their national sovereignty. Under the influence of public opinion, leaders of many countries have raised this issue in different ways.

    Whether in Buenos Aires or Rome, whether in Copenhagen or Rio de Janeiro, there are calls for the protection of sovereign independence everywhere.

    We, the Soviet people, hope for peace among all nations and all countries. We hope to achieve peace based on mutual respect and equality. I think everyone now recognizes that a sovereign country is threatened if it joins a military bloc, because only the strongest and richest countries decide everything in a military bloc. The fact that foreign military bases are built on the territory of many sovereign countries makes this danger even more serious. In this case, no sovereign country can be sure that it will not be dragged into war against its own will. The British newspapers are full of opposition to the attempt to drag Britain into hostile acts against China. In the recent Italian elections, the Italian people showed their disdain for those who were subservient and pursued war policies.

    Erenburg said: We, the fighters for peace, warmly support all proposals for gradual and universal disarmament under international supervision. We firmly oppose the troops of armed revanchists and the establishment of new troops that are nominally international institutions but are actually controlled by one country. We, the fighters for peace, must support all measures aimed at guaranteeing national sovereignty and protecting national security. We must support those in the public who, although not fighting alongside us for world peace, oppose the forces of war. We, the fighters for peace, have long been working to restore the United Nations to an institution that can ensure the security of all countries. In view of this, China should obtain the seat it rightfully deserves in the United Nations.

    Erenburg said: Concluding a peace treaty with a unified and peace-loving Germany will eliminate the danger of war in Europe. Germany must become
    a sovereign country, but its neighbors, no, all the people,
    must be guaranteed that the German spirit of revenge and aggression will not be revived. A peace-loving Germany must not join any military bloc or alliance against the people. As for the struggle of the people of Asia and Africa for independence, we, the fighters for peace, support the right of all peoples to independence and advocate for the resolution of all disputes through consultation.

    Erenburg concluded: We have passed the first stage, we cannot stop halfway. We must work harder to strive for peace, so that none of us will feel ashamed and blush when we see his children in Budapest, London, Moscow or New York.

    Börhan, Secretary of the Argentine Peace Committee, said that the Argentine people are resolutely fighting against the policy of war. The peace movement in Argentina is constantly expanding. Argentine peace fighters firmly demand the development of normal economic relations with the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, because only through international cooperation and strengthening peace can Argentina's economic difficulties be eliminated.

    Stanisław Kulczyński, Polish representative and Deputy Speaker of the Polish Parliament, emphasized that the solution of the German problem is particularly important now that revanchist slogans have been raised again in West Germany and attempts are being made to restore the Wehrmacht. The struggle to strive for a four-power conference, restore German unity, and oppose war treaties is extremely important.

    Isabelle Blume (Belgium), a member of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council, said that the victories achieved in the struggle for peace and mutual understanding and some diplomatic steps have made this spring a season full of hope for all mankind. The new situation is the result of the active efforts of peace fighters under the leadership of the World Peace Council for four years.

    Blume then talked about the tasks and role of peace fighters, saying that they must ensure that the spirit of consultation triumphs over the use of force.

    New Sock, a famous Indian peace movement leader and member of parliament, talked about the peace movement in India. He said: I can say with certainty that India will not participate in a war against China or the Soviet Union. Our Indian delegation hopes to put forward a proposal that we know is in line with the wishes of the representatives attending the meeting. We hope to use the following words as the slogan of the Budapest Conference: On every issue that has caused the current disputes, consult, consult, and consult again! Our demand for major powers to conduct consultations should not be subject to any conditions or reservations. Any peaceful solution that can lead to peace, any peace proposal put forward by any party should be supported by us. Let us work hard in every country to make our governments do everything in their power to promote consultations that will bring peace to all mankind.

    The next speaker, D'Astier de la Vigerie, agreed with the suggestion of the Indian representative. He suggested that the conference consider this suggestion immediately.

    Gabriel D'Arboussier (Black Africa), Vice-Chairman of the World Peace Council, supported consultations aimed at easing the international situation. He said: The African people were very pleased to learn about the imminent realization of the Korean armistice.

    Representatives from Lebanon and Sweden also spoke at the meeting.

    世界和平理事会继续开会
    讨论第一项议程“举行谈判及缓和国际紧张局势”
    戈登夫人报告第二项议程“世界和平理事会的任务和组成”
    【新华社十八日讯】据塔斯社布达佩斯十八日讯：世界和平理事会十七日上午会议由郭沫若担任主席。会议继续讨论第一项议程：“举行谈判及缓和国际紧张局势”。戈登夫人并在会上就第二项议程“世界和平理事会的任务和组成”作了报告。
    加拿大女作家莉里安·维恩与诺贝尔化学奖金得奖人、英国生物化学家理查德·辛治先后发言，要求大国协商以获致和平。莉里安·维恩建议作家、记者和科学家联名写信给大国，要求大国以协商精神来代替战争精神。理查德·辛治说：在提出协商建议的时候，不能忘记禁止大规模破坏的武器的问题现在还未得到最后解决。因此，必须继续尽一切力量，使世界不被卷入可能使用这种武器的战争中去。
    世界和平理事会理事凡达·华西列夫斯卡（苏联）在发言中谈到各国文化与科学关系的问题。她说，交流文化和科学成就是一种友谊的表现。近几年来，好几百个外国代表团访问了苏联，我们出版了几百万本外国作家的书籍，几百个戏院上演外国作家的戏剧。但是，我们觉得这还不够，尤其是因为和平的愿望及友好的感情正在全世界的人民间愈来愈广泛地扩展开来。苏联代表团受权在本届和平理事会会议上宣布，苏联最广泛的人民群众希望与别国大大地扩展文化与科学的联系。
    华西列夫斯卡最后说：像你们一样，我希望千百万的人民都能互相认识，互相了解，清楚地认识我们的人民，我们的城市和乡村，我们的多种的文化，而不是透过愚昧、偏见、诽谤和漠不关心的眼镜来看这些东西。可以用偏见来鼓动互不了解的人敌对起来，但是没有人能使朋友们互相扼住对方的喉管来杀死对方。
    应世界和平理事会邀请列席会议的法国代表阿波·德皮埃尔在发言中揭露了“欧洲防务集团”的侵略实质。他说，法国人民正在进行顽强的斗争，反对批准“欧洲防务集团”条约。决不能让德国变成第二个朝鲜。举行四大国会议是解决德国问题的唯一办法。我们必须使用压力，迫使我们的政府召开四国会议。
    世界和平理事会常务委员会委员、日本和平委员会主席大山郁夫教授叙述了日本各地广泛展开的和平运动的情况。他着重指出，朝鲜停战是缓和国际紧张局势的第一步。这会解除美国占领日本的藉口。他接着说，要是日本人民一天不从外国统治下得到解放，一天不恢复他们自己决定自己命运的自由，日本就一天仍然是亚洲的一个战争基地。
    大山郁夫说，目前在日本，争取和平与独立的运动正迅速增长。要求废除旧金山和约、日美安全条约、日美行政协定、要求美国军队撤出日本并取消日本领土上的美国战争基地的斗争已经成为所有日本人共同关心的事情。同样，反对政府没收农田和渔场来建立美国战争基地的人民运动也得到了全体人民的支持。
    大山郁夫指出：与中国和苏联恢复正常的外交和贸易关系的要求正在日本人民中间得到越来越多的支持。日本人民不愿意与亚洲人民作战。他们热望与亚洲及太平洋地区的所有人民，主要是与中国和苏联的人民维持友好的关系。
    大山郁夫最后说：必须通过五大国之间的协商，求得以和平方式解决国际争端，缓和国际紧张局势。做到这一点，而后才能实现日本人民的愿望——日本从战争阵营转到和平阵营。
    世界和平理事会理事戈登夫人就第二项议程“世界和平理事会的任务和组成”作了报告。戈登夫人说，世界和平理事会是一个有活力的组织，它支持公众的一切合理愿望，它提出一切办法来谴责使用武力，促成互相协商，以增进国际合作，彼此尊重民族独立。和平运动必须密切注意时局，必须教会公众如何利用局势使协商精神贯穿每一件事情。
    世界和平理事会的任务是与各国人民保持经常的联系，把世界上的一切重要事件确切地告诉他们。所以，世界和平理事会必须继续把所有正直的人民团结在它的队伍中，不管他们的政治见解如何，只要他们尊重人类，相信他们的前途，并希望用和平的力量保证这个前途的到来。世界和平理事会的组成分子应该是能够对重要的政治和经济问题提出独立见解的人们。
    因此，理事会的成员应该包括政治界领袖、经济学家、律师和科学家。它也应该包括那些具有文学与艺术天才的男女在内，这些人可以向人民解释事情的意义。世界和平理事会中应该有不同信仰的传教士，因为他们是世界上许多男女的顾问。
    理事会应该包括工会、妇女会和青年联合会的代表。在这些代表中应该有领袖，特别是应该也有工人、农民和家庭妇女，他们可以把他们在日常斗争中所获得的经验来丰富我们的运动。最后，和平理事会的性质应该是真正世界性的。自从一九四九年和平运动在巴黎产生以来，世界上发生了一些具有历史意义的事情。中国人民已经取得了解放，并且在进行伟大的和平建设。在其他的亚洲国家，争取民族独立的英勇斗争在继续进行。伟大的印度人民正在努力争取和平解决目前一切使人类深感不安的纠纷。争取解放的精神已经遍及整个拉丁美洲。非洲大陆也都嗅到革新的气息。因此，很明显，世界和平理事会的成分应该反映全世界人民的愿望，而不仅是反映某个大陆的人民的愿望。
    戈登夫人指出，达斯迪埃·德拉维热里在这次会议上发言时说过，世界和平理事会并不是一个教授的会议，也不是一个外交家的会议。世界和平理事会从人民大众中汲取力量。这样就会使人民感觉得到他们自己的力量。在这方面，戈登夫人强调指出，各国人民对联合国都抱着很大的期望，并且要求它按照大西洋宪章的原则办事。
    最后，戈登夫人代表国际民主妇女联合会所属一亿四千万妇女以及派有代表参加最近哥本哈根世界妇女大会的各国妇女，向世界和平理事会致敬。
    罗马尼亚代表丹尼尔·洛波尔和智利代表卡洛斯·费加拉·蒙特罗将军接着发言，他们都指出，和平运动要争取使联合国恢复其原来宗旨，成为真正世界性质的组织。丹尼尔·洛波尔说，和平运动要争取让十四个有权加入联合国的国家全部加入，争取使联合国接纳中华人民共和国参加。洛波尔并支持华西列夫斯卡关于加强国际文化与科学联系的建议。他建议召开国际建筑师与建筑工人会议、国际医师会议，并建议举行各种体育竞赛。
    巴基斯坦代表、“巴基斯坦时报”发行人马兹哈·阿里汗强调指出所有纠纷都能通过谈判获得解决。他并说，巴基斯坦人民反对将巴基斯坦拉入美国军事计划的任何企图，抵抗着一切外国侵略者的阴谋。
    应世界和平理事会的邀请参加会议的法国雅各宾俱乐部主席艾尔努说：他是属于激进社会党的。他支持关于展开争取协商的运动的建议。他说：我们必须要作出决定，这种决定将广泛地有助于向人民解释和平运动所起的作用与重要意义。将有更多人民支持这个运动和它所提倡的协商精神。
    在世界和平理事会理事、古巴作家胡安·马里内略发言以后，达斯迪埃·德拉维热里代表大会主席团提出今后工作议程的动议。
    主席团建议：组织一个关于一般政治问题的委员会，拟订提倡协商的运动的一般原则。组织一个委员会来制订进行这种运动的实际方式与办法，并考虑世界和平理事会的任务。组织一个关于文化交流问题委员会。
    主席团同时建议十八日不举行全体会议，各委员会分头进行工作。全体大会应该在六月十九日下午继续举行。
    主席团的建议被一致通过。
     【新华社十八日讯】据塔斯社布达佩斯十七日讯：世界和平理事会十六日下午继续举行会议，由戈登夫人担任主席。
    首先发言的是世界和平理事会理事艾里伯尔托·哈拉（墨西哥）。他说，拉丁美洲国家都被美国垄断资本侵入。美国垄断资本用各种形式干涉拉丁美洲国家的事务，这些垄断资本的统治阻止了拉丁美洲国家的经济发展，并且强迫拉丁美洲国家缔结奴役性协定。哈拉最后说：必须要使大国缔结和平公约以实现全世界人民的愿望。
    印度国民大会党党员查图尔·纳拉茵·马拉维亚在发言中说：苏联和中国政府所采取的有远见的政策已经引起了全世界良好的反应。他接着说：我们印度人民不能不特别强调那些为争取民族独立和自由而斗争的亚洲人民的问题。只有我们邻国人民完全获得自由以后，持久和平才会完全实现。他指出，殖民地人民所遭受的压迫也越来越厉害，他谈到外国军队在印度支那和马来亚对当地人民的难以想像的暴行，谈到外约旦、伊朗、伊拉克、沙特阿拉伯等地争取民族独立的斗争受到镇压的情形，谈到关于在近东建立军事基地、拒绝把苏彝士运河区交还给埃及的事情。他最后说，苏联和中华人民共和国是民族自由和民族自决的最好朋友，因而也是世界和平的最好朋友。
    接着是爱伦堡发言。他在回顾了和平运动的成就之后说：战争力量根本没有觉得它们已经完全失败，而只认为朝鲜即将停战是他们第一个巨大的挫折。它们还没有死心，还希望在其他地方捞回它的损失。一些鼓吹战争的人因为贪婪无餍所以讨厌协议，另外一些人则被狂热主义、对进步的盲目仇恨、对将来的恐惧迷住了。我们看到：朝鲜的停战吓坏了李承晚，而关于大国间在德国问题上和平协议的主张吓坏了阿登纳。战争势力仍在施用压力，想影响某些国家的政策。当然我不愿意夸张任何事情，但是闭起眼睛不看要战争——冷战或热战——的人的拚命挣扎，也是幼稚的。我们必须不倦地努力使每个人知道真相。我们必须确使千百万人民的声音更加有力传播出去，我们必须使各国政府注意人民的和平意志，而不是一小撮商人或政客的阴谋。
    爱伦堡说：人们面对着许多问题，尤其重要的是他们国家主权的问题，许多国家的领袖在舆论的影响下，都以不同的方式提出了这个问题。
    无论在布宜诺斯艾利斯还是在罗马，无论在哥本哈根还是在里约热内卢，到处都有保卫主权独立的呼声。
    我们苏联人民希望各民族、各国之间和平。我们希望实现以互相尊重、平等为基础的和平。我认为，每一个人现在都认识到，一个主权国家如果加入一个军事集团，就要遭到威胁，因为在军事集团中只有最强大、最富有的国家决定着一切。在许多主权国家的领土上建有外国军事基地，这一事实使得这种危险更加严重。在这种情况下，没有一个主权国家能够有把握说它不会违反它自己的意愿而被卷入战争。对于把英国卷入对中国的敌对行为的企图，英国报纸上满篇都是反对的言论。在最近意大利的选举中，意大利人民表现了他们对奴颜卑膝和执行战争政策的人们的唾弃。
    爱伦堡说：我们，和平的战士，热烈地支持所有主张在国际监督下逐步普遍裁减军备的建议。我们坚决反对武装报复主义者的军队，反对成立名义上是国际机构的、而实际上是一国操纵的新的军队。我们，和平的战士，必须支持所有旨在保证各国主权和保卫各国安全的措施。我们必须支持公众中的那些虽然并不与我们并肩进行争取世界和平的斗争，但却反对战争力量的人们。我们，和平的战士，长时间以来就一直在努力使联合国恢复成为一个能确保各国安全的机构。有鉴于此，中国就应该在联合国中取得它理应据有的席位。
    爱伦堡说：和统一的、爱好和平的德国缔结和约，将消除在欧洲发生战争的危险。德国必须成为
    一个主权国家，但是它的邻国，不，所有的人民，
    一定要得到保证说德国报复主义精神和侵略力量不会复活。一个爱好和平的德国决不能加入任何反对人民的军事集团或联盟。至于亚洲和非洲人民争取独立的斗争，我们，和平的战士，支持各族人民争取独立的权利，并力主以协商方式来解决一切纷争。
    爱伦堡最后说：我们已经过了第一阶段，我们不能半途而止。我们要更努力地来争取和平，使我们中间没有一个人在看到在布达佩斯、伦敦、莫斯科或是纽约的他的小孩子的时候，会感到惭愧而脸红起来。
    阿根廷和平委员会书记伯尔汉发言说，阿根廷人民正坚决地进行斗争，反对战争政策。和平运动在阿根廷正不断扩张。阿根廷的和平战士坚决要求与苏联和各人民民主国家发展正常的经济关系，因为只有通过国际合作和加强和平才能消除阿根廷的经济困难。
    波兰代表、波兰议会副议长斯坦尼斯瓦夫·库尔钦斯基着重指出，在现在西德又再度提出了报复主义的口号，并企图恢复国防军的时候，德国问题的解决就特别重要。争取举行四国会议，恢复德国统一，反对战争条约的斗争是极为重要的。
    世界和平理事会常务委员会委员伊莎贝丽·布伦姆（比利时）说，在争取和平和相互了解的斗争中得到的胜利以及一些外交步骤已经使得今年春天成了一个使全人类满怀希望的季节。新的形势是四年来和平战士在世界和平理事会的领导下积极努力的结果。
    布伦姆然后谈到和平战士的任务和作用，她说，他们必须确使协商精神战胜使用武力的办法。
    著名的印度和平运动领袖、国会议员新·索克谈到印度的和平运动情况。他说：我可以肯定地说：印度不会参加对中国或苏联的战争。我们印度代表团希望提出一项建议，我们知道这项建议是符合于参加会议的代表的希望的。我们希望把下列这样的话，作为布达佩斯会议的口号：在造成目前争端的每个问题上进行协商，协商，再协商！我们主张大国进行协商的要求不应该附有任何条件或保留。任何能导致和平的解决方法，任何方面所提出的任何和平建议都应该受到我们的拥护。让我们在每一个国家努力，以使我们的政府尽它们一切力量来促成将给全人类带来和平的协商。
    下一个发言人达斯迪埃·德拉维热里赞成印度代表的建议。他建议大会立刻考虑这个建议。
    世界和平理事会副主席加布里尔·达波赛（黑非洲）支持旨在缓和国际局面的协商。他说：非洲人民获悉关于朝鲜停战即将实现的消息时感到非常满意。
    在会上发言的还有黎巴嫩和瑞典的代表。
