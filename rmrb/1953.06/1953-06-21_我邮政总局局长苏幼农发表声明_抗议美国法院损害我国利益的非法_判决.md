Xinhua News Agency, June 20th: Su Younong, Director of the Postal Administration of the People's Republic of China, issued the following statement regarding the more than $520,000 deposit held by the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau (which has now been taken over by the Postal Administration of the People's Republic of China) in the American Express Bank in New York. On February 9th of this year, the United States Southern District Court of New York illegally "judged" that this deposit belonged to the Chiang Kai-shek bandit reactionary remnant group in Taiwan. This illegal "judgment" clearly damages the rights and interests of all the people of the People's Republic of China – including all depositors and holders of unredeemed drafts of the bureau. Therefore, Su Younong, Director of the Postal Administration of the People's Republic of China, issues the following statement:

    In February 1953, the United States Southern District Court of New York made an illegal "judgment" to award the more than $520,000 deposit of the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau (which has now been taken over by our bureau) in the American Express Bank to the so-called "Republic of China and the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau." In order to protect the inviolable rights and interests of the People's Republic of China and the depositors of our bureau, I hereby lodge a serious protest against this illegal "judgment."

    All the rights and interests of the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau at home and abroad belong to the entire people of the People's Republic of China – including all depositors and holders of unredeemed drafts of the bureau. The Postal Administration of the People's Republic of China is the sole legal representative of this right and interest, which is an indisputable fact. Furthermore, in accordance with the regulations of the Government Administration Council of our Central People's Government, the depositors and holders of unredeemed drafts of the bureau have already been compensated according to the pre-Liberation currency value to ensure that their interests are not harmed. However, the U.S. government and its courts have consistently implemented their reactionary policy of hostility towards the Chinese people, and have illegally declared the deposit of our Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau in the American Express Bank, allowing a handful of the Taiwan Kuomintang reactionary group, who have long been spurned by the Chinese people, to openly steal it. This is an act that seriously damages the legitimate interests of the Chinese people.

    Therefore, on behalf of the Postal Administration of the People's Republic of China, I lodge a solemn protest and solemnly declare as follows: The above "judgment" made by the United States Southern District Court of New York is illegal and therefore invalid. Any disposition by the U.S. government and its judicial organs of all rights and interests of the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau in the American Express Bank and other banks without the consent of our bureau is invalid, and this bureau reserves all rights to seek recourse and compensation.

          Su Younong, Director of the Postal Administration of the People's Republic of China

    我邮政总局局长苏幼农发表声明
    抗议美国法院损害我国利益的非法“判决”
    【新华社二十日讯】已由中华人民共和国邮政总局接管的邮政储金汇业局，在美国纽约运通银行存有存款五十二万多美元，今年二月九日，美国纽约州南区巡回法院非法“判决”这笔存款归台湾蒋匪反动残余集团所有。这一非法的“判决”，显然损害了中华人民共和国全体人民——包括该局的全体存款人和未兑汇票的所有权人——的权益。因此，中华人民共和国邮政总局局长苏幼农特发表声明如下：
    一九五三年二月间，美国纽约州南区巡回法院作了一项非法的“判决”，将已由我局接管的邮政储金汇业局存在美国运通银行的存款五十二万多美元，判归所谓“中华民国及邮政储金汇业局”。为了保护中华人民共和国和我局存款人不容侵犯的权益，我特对此非法“判决”提出严重抗议。
    邮政储金汇业局在国内外的全部权益，属于中华人民共和国全国人民——包括该局的全体存款人和未兑汇票的所有权人。中华人民共和国邮政总局是这个权益的唯一合法代表人，已是无可争辩的事实，并且已经遵照我中央人民政府政务院规定，按照解放前币值清偿该局存款人及未兑汇票的所有权人，以保障他们的利益不受到损失。但美国政府及其法院一贯执行其敌视中国人民的反动政策，把我邮政储金汇业局在美国运通银行的存款非法宣判，使一小撮早已被中国人民所唾弃的台湾中国国民党反动集团得以公然窃夺，这是严重损害中国人民合法利益的行为。
    为此，我代表中华人民共和国邮政总局提出严正抗议，并郑重声明如下：美国纽约州南区巡回法院所作以上“判决”是非法的，因而也是无效的。美国政府及其司法机关，关于邮政储金汇业局在美国运通银行及其他银行中的一切权益的任何未经我局同意的处置，均属无效，本局保有一切追索赔偿之权。
      中华人民共和国邮政总局局长  苏幼农
      一九五三年六月二十日
