Work Planning is the Central Link in Planning Management
——Some Experiences from Anshan Iron and Steel Company in Implementing Work Planning
Zhang Yue, Engineer, Production Department, Anshan Iron and Steel Company

I. What is Work Planning?

Modern industry is a massive, complexly organized, minutely divided, and continuously operating whole. Taking Anshan Iron and Steel Company as an example, turning iron ore into steel rails, screws, or steel ropes requires a long production process involving mining, coal washing, coking, ore dressing, iron smelting, steelmaking, and steel rolling, all the way to processing and manufacturing. This must be coordinated with transportation, raw material supply, power supply, and mechanical and electrical maintenance. Without a scientific and effective centralized management, it would be impossible for this productive organism to function normally, for each link to be closely connected, and for the entire production to proceed accurately. This scientific method of managing production is planning management, and its central link is work planning.

An enterprise, as a component of the entire national economy, must complete the national plan and the assigned tasks from orders from other brother factories and mines. Anshan Iron and Steel Company has established order relationships with 813 entities throughout the country, including many production and capital construction units from the foot of Changbai Mountain to the Tibetan Plateau, and from the Mongolian grasslands to the Pearl River Delta. Faced with such a situation, even a single batch of steel produced incorrectly could prevent the completion of a specific order, which would affect the inability of other factories and mines guided by the planned economy to fulfill their plans. The serious consequence would be delaying the pace of national industrialization to some extent. Therefore, it is said, "The national plan is the law." But what relies on what to concretize the national plan in an enterprise? This depends on the work plan.

The People's Daily editorial on April 8 this year pointed out: "Work planning is to concretize the production plan, down to each workshop (pithead), work section, team, process, and type of work; through it, each workshop, each process, and each section can be organized organically to strive together to complete the production plan." More simply, work planning is a necessary method of organizing production, answering the following questions: 1. What to produce? (variety, size, etc.) 2. What to use? (quantity and type of raw materials, semi-finished products, and spare parts required) 3. How to do it, and which department should do it? (Determination of production procedures and methods) 4. When to do it, and how much to do? (Work progress) If the work plan is attached to the actual completion situation and made visual, it becomes an instruction chart. So, although the two are not the same thing, they are closely related.

II. What are the Benefits of Implementing Work Planning?

1. Improving Equipment Capacity and Operating Rate

The task of work planning is not only to complete the national plan and order tasks, so that leaders and every staff member have a clear understanding, but its positive significance also lies in improving equipment capacity and operating rate through work planning. Since Anshan Iron and Steel Company's Chemical Plant implemented work planning and instruction charts, the distillation capacity of the tar workshop has increased by 25%, and the coal storage capacity of the coal washing workshop has increased by 15%. After the coking workshop implemented the cyclical maintenance method recommended by Soviet experts to fix the coking cycle, the operating rate increased from 99.4% to 99.8%, which can increase the annual production of coke by thousands of tons. After the primary rolling mill produced according to the instruction chart, the hourly steel rolling volume in December 1952 increased by 12%.

In the case of unbalanced production capacity, continuously striving for relative balance is an important task in production management. With the mastery of work plans and instruction charts, measures can be taken in a timely manner to address the problems they point out and eliminate weak links. In the past, the heating furnace capacity of the medium plate mill was insufficient, and waiting for heat often occurred. After the reconstruction and modification designed by Soviet expert Comrade Makarov at the end of last year, the heating capacity was improved. At this time, the rolling mill appeared to be insufficient in capacity and could not keep up. Now they are strengthening the adjustment and maintenance of the rolling mill in order to achieve a new balance on the basis of higher production capacity.

2. Reducing the Reserve of Semi-finished Products and Unfinished Products, and Accelerating Capital Turnover

In order to implement economic accounting, reduce costs, and make national funds more effective, it is first necessary to shorten the production cycle to the shortest limit and to reduce the reserve of semi-finished products and unfinished products as much as possible. In early 1950, Anshan Iron and Steel Company accumulated several thousand tons of steel plates due to the lack of order distribution tables and the inability to arrange work plans. After having work plans and instruction charts, the situation has greatly improved. The gradual reduction in the number of steel billets stored throughout the company in the past three years is the result of the gradual progress of work planning and the emphasis on the speed of capital turnover.

3. Balanced Production

An enterprise must not only complete the plan but also complete it evenly every month, every week, and every day; not only the entire enterprise or the entire factory completes the plan, but every workshop, every work section, every team, and every machine tool universally complete the plan. Implementing work planning and instruction charts can gradually approach this state. In the three months of September, October, and November 1952, when the medium-sized rolling mill did not implement instruction charts, production was first loose and then tight, and the output in the first ten days of each month differed by more than 20% from the output in the last ten days. After the implementation of instruction charts, the difference in output per ten days in February and March 1953 was less than 6%, and the production situation day and night was also balanced.

4. Liberating Leaders from the Mire of Bureaucracy

Enterprise leaders must be good at using work planning, this advanced scientific production management method, to organize production, use systematic functional organizations, especially production scheduling organizations, to direct production, otherwise, they will inevitably fall into the mire of bureaucracy. Working hard and busily, but ultimately failing to complete the task. Before the implementation of work planning and instruction charts, the director and other responsible comrades of the medium-sized rolling mill often received emergency calls in the evening or personally went to the factory to solve some specific problems, such as unavailable rolling rolls and insufficient spare parts supply. Since the implementation of work planning, the establishment of a duty foreman responsibility system, and working according to the instruction charts, the work has been on track, there is predictability, and the director does not need to "do everything himself." However, this leadership method has not yet been promoted by all leading cadres of Anshan Iron and Steel Company. For example, the refractory material factory lacks personnel, and all leading cadres from the work section chief and workshop director to the factory department are on long day shifts. There is no duty foreman system, and the scheduling system is not sound, so the leadership is very passive, problems are not solved in a timely manner, and both output and quality are good during the day and bad at night.

III. The Compilation, Inspection, and Implementation of Work Plans

1. Principles for Compiling Work Plans

(1) Systematic. Work plans and instruction charts must be systematically and organically linked from top to bottom. The production of modern enterprises is intricately linked to many different links and various factors. Work plans must be compiled to adapt to this characteristic. From the monthly and weekly work plans of the management organization to the instruction charts of each workshop and work section, they must be interconnected, closely coordinated, guaranteed at all levels, and not separated from each other, so as to be connected into a string and form a whole to achieve the expected results. Arranging monthly, weekly, day, night, and shift work plans is an in-depth process of making plans more and more concrete and accurate. They cannot be cancelled and replaced with each other but are guaranteed at all levels.

(2) Comprehensive. The work plan and chart for production tasks are the core of all plans and charts, but they must be fully coordinated with the work plans for transportation, maintenance, power, and raw material supply. If only the work plan for the production tasks of the production plants and mines is grasped purely and isolatedly, and the work plans of other auxiliary departments and supply departments, especially the plans for maintenance and spare parts supply, are relaxed, the production plan will inevitably fail. Anshan Iron and Steel Company has done very poorly in this regard. The repair work of the thin plate factory in February this year changed plans three times in a month, which is one example.

(3) Accurate. It is true that work plans cannot be required to be absolutely accurate, 100% completed, and not changed at all; but if problems are carefully considered during compilation and the laws of production are truly grasped, it is entirely possible to strive for the greatest possible accuracy. Anshan Iron and Steel Company once ordered externally due to the steelmaking plant's inability to produce steel completely according to the steel grade, and increased a part of steel ingots as turnover, and tried to use its own reserve steel ingots to make adjustments. This has reduced the impact on the production of various steel rolling mills. If it is foreseen that the plan may be disrupted, appropriate measures should be taken to remedy it. For example, the opening of the third concentrator was delayed, and the concentrate could not be balanced. The company once used recycled tailings to make up for the needs. In the past three years, the factors that have disrupted work plans that we have encountered, in addition to the failure to produce steel according to the steel grade, also include more changes in orders, inaccurate maintenance plans, insufficient spare parts supply, no guarantee of raw material supply, and abnormal transportation.

2. Basis for Compiling Work Plans

The basic basis is the most important, and other bases should also be considered.

(1) Basic basis: National plan, order distribution table.

(2) Other basis: Maintenance plan, average advanced quota, equipment capacity and usage, raw material balance (including self-used finished products and semi-finished products), power balance, transportation balance, technical regulations, safety regulations, technical conditions and production procedures, production task completion.

3. The Necessity of Inspection

Implementing work plans must emphasize inspection, especially having a sound scheduling organization to supervise and guarantee. The People's Daily editorial on April 8 also pointed out: "But having a work plan only solves half of the problem. To truly realize the plan, there must be a central organization to supervise implementation. Therefore, at the same time as formulating the work plan, the production scheduling responsibility system must be established first..." The scheduling room checks the progress every hour, and its scope is the shift and day and night work plans. Other work plans by day, week, and month must be formulated by enterprises, factories, mines, workshops, and teams according to different situations, separately listing plans and actual quantities, calculating the percentage of completion and accumulated quantity, and conducting regular inspections by special personnel responsible. Anshan Iron and Steel Company has not done well enough in this regard, and this discussion on the plan should be strengthened and improved.

4. Implementation Methods

To implement work plans, we must first recognize that work planning is an advanced scientific production management method that can correctly lead production, concretely organize production, implement various regulations and systems, connect various organizational units, and go deep into the masses in order to ultimately realize plan management and complete rhythmic and balanced production. It is not only the central link of plan management but also the concentrated expression of plan management. Therefore, first of all, we must establish various reporting systems, handover systems, duty director systems, and responsibility systems, and assign the work plan as a task to production cadres at all levels, with responsibility at each level. Secondly, through work plans, we must connect the various functional organizations of production, transportation, maintenance, power, and raw material supply, as well as the different units of factories and factories, workshops and workshops, and work sections and work sections in production, and organize them. The work plan should play a connecting role like a silk thread connecting many pearls. Finally, the work plan should also be made clear to every actual operating worker in the form of an instruction chart, so that everyone knows what to do and when, and how much work to complete every hour. Only in this way can we start at the most basic and original place in the production chain to ensure the completion of the work plan. This experience is inspired by the medium-sized factory in Anshan Iron and Steel Company where the work plan is implemented better, and Anshan Iron and Steel Company is now promoting their advanced experience.

It is not difficult to understand that it is wrong to think of work planning simply and superficially as compiling numbers and drawing tables. It is also wrong to hand over the work plan to the production administrator or to think that it can be done by the production section chief alone.

IV. Several Ideological Issues

In the process of promoting work planning and instruction charts, Anshan Iron and Steel Company has discovered several erroneous ideas and practices, which must be criticized.

1. Conditionalism

Some people believe that since work plans must be accurate, they should be implemented only after quotas and original records are completely accurate. This is an absolutist view of the problem. Quotas are not immutable, and the experience of advanced producers can break old quotas at any time. Requiring work plans to be accurate does not mean that the plan and the actual situation should have no difference at all. In the process of development of things, some factors are not discovered in advance or are not easy to discover in advance, and they must be gradually understood in practice. Therefore, there will not be and cannot be required to be absolute accuracy, but rather to require and strive for considerable but also the greatest possible accuracy.

Some people also believe that their unit's production is complex, and the equipment and management are still problematic, so work planning and instruction charts cannot be implemented. They say: "To implement instruction charts, unless the charts are automated." This is essentially the idea of ​​"cancellationism." The fact is the opposite. The improvement of the situation requires people's subjective efforts, and work planning and instruction charts are precisely the powerful weapons that promote the transformation. The storage and use of straightening rollers in the medium-sized factory were initially chaotic. After implementing instruction charts and establishing a special person counting system, it became easier to master. Moreover, the more complex the production process, the more it is necessary to implement work planning and instruction charts. We cannot imagine that the General Machinery Factory can work normally without a work plan. They need seven people to work from the 10th to the 25th of each month to complete the compilation of the work plan. The Chemical Plant and the Dagushan Iron Mine, which have relatively detailed work plans and a wider scope of production processes, are in similar situations to the General Machinery Factory.

2. "Responsibility Sharing System"

Due to a lack of understanding that work planning is an advanced production management method, and due to a lack of deep understanding of the responsibility system, some people regard the implementation of work planning and the inspection of work planning as work shared equally by the Party, administration, trade union, and Communist Youth League. Individual comrades in the Gongchangling Iron Mine have similar views. In addition, there are different views on who is responsible for and leads the work plan. We believe that the administrative deputy factory director in charge of production should lead the work plan, and the production section should be responsible for and make specific arrangements. The Party, trade union, and Communist Youth League should assist, support, and supervise, and should not share responsibilities equally, let alone replace the administration.

3. Copying

According to the experience of the work plan personnel training class held by Anshan Iron and Steel Company, most students hope to learn a set of ready-made work plan systems and instruction chart styles that can be immediately used in their own units, so they do not pay enough attention to and lack understanding of the basic meaning and principles. It was discovered in the casting pipe factory that after the daily work plan was made, it was decided to cancel the weekly work plan. When promoting the experience of the medium-sized rolling mill, it was also found that some factories copied the plans and charts of the medium-sized rolling mill without changing them. It must be recognized that work plans and instruction charts are both action instructions for specifically guiding production, and their compilation must be combined with the specific conditions of the unit, and it is impossible to copy the experience of other units.

    作业计划是计划管理的中心环节
    ——鞍钢实行作业计划的一点体会
    鞍山钢铁公司生产处工程师  张钺
    一、什么是作业计划
    近代工业是一个规模庞大、组织复杂、分工细密、连续作业的整体。拿鞍钢来说，把铁矿石变成钢轨螺丝钉或钢绳，就要经过采矿、洗煤、炼焦、选矿、炼铁、炼钢、轧钢一直到加工制造的漫长生产过程，还要配合上运输、原材料供应、动力供应、机电检修等配合工作。假如没有一种科学的有效的集中管理，就根本不可能让这个生产有机体正常活动，各个环节密切联系，并使整个生产准确的进行。这种管理生产的科学方法就是计划管理，而实现它的中心环节就是作业计划。
    一个企业，作为整个国民经济的组成部分说来，它必须完成国家计划和其它兄弟厂矿的订货分配计划任务。全国各地与鞍钢建立订货关系的已有八百一十三个户头，包括从长白山麓到康藏高原，由蒙古草原到珠江三角洲的许多生产和基本建设单位。面临这样的情况，有时我们只要出错了一炉钢，就可能使某项订货不能完成，这就影响在计划经济指导下的其他工厂和矿山不能完成计划，严重的后果则将是在某种程度上延缓了国家工业化的速度，所以说：“国家的计划就是法律”。但要依靠什么把国家计划在一个企业中具体化呢？这就要靠作业计划。
    今年四月八日的人民日报社论指出：“作业计划就是把生产计划具体化，把它具体化到各个车间（坑口）、工段、小组，各个工序和工种中去；经过它可以把各个车间、各个工序、以及各个科股有机地组织起来，共同为完成生产计划而努力。”更通俗一些说，作业计划是组织生产的必要方法，它解答了以下几个问题：1、生产什么？（品种、尺寸等）2、用什么来做？（需要的原材料、半成品、备品的数量和种类）3、怎样做，由哪一部门做？
    （生产程序和方法的决定）4、何时做，做多少？
    （工作的进度）假如把作业计划附上实际完成情况并使之形象化，就成为指示图表。所以二者虽不是同一事物，却有密切的关系。
    二、实行作业计划有哪些好处
    1、提高设备能力和作业率
    作业计划的任务，不但在于完成国家计划和订货任务，使领导及每个工作人员心中有数，其积极的意义还在于通过作业计划能够提高设备能力和作业率。鞍钢化工总厂自实行作业计划和指示图表以后，焦油车间的蒸溜能力提高了百分之二十五，洗煤车间存煤能力提高了百分之十五，炼焦车间自实行苏联专家建议采用循环检修法固定推焦周期后，作业率由百分之九十九点四，提高为百分之九十九点八，全年可增产焦炭数千吨。初轧厂按指示图表生产以后，一九五二年十二月每小时轧钢量提高了百分之十二。
    在生产能力不平衡的情况下，不断争取相对的平衡，是生产管理上的一项重要工作。掌握了作业计划和指示图表，就可以及时针对它所指出的问题，采取措施，消除薄弱环节。过去，中板厂加热炉的能力不足，时常发生待热现象，去年年底经苏联专家马卡洛夫同志重新设计改建以后，提高了加热能力，这时轧钢机却又显得能力不足，配合不上了。现在他们正加强对轧钢机的调整和检修，以求在更高生产能力的基础上取得新的平衡。
    2、减少半成品、未完成品的储备量，并加速资金周转
    为了实行经济核算，降低成本，使国家资金发挥更大效能，首先就必须把生产周期缩到最短的限度上，并要尽可能减低半成品和未完成品的储备量。一九五○年初，鞍钢因没有订货分配表，排不出作业计划，盲目生产的结果积压了几千吨钢板。有了作业计划和指示图表以后，情况就大大好转。三年来全公司储备钢坯的数量逐渐减少，就是作业计划逐渐进步及重视资金周转速度的结果。
    3、均衡生产
    一个企业不仅要完成计划，并且要每月每周每日均衡地完成；不单单是整个企业或全厂完成计划，而且要每个车间、每个工段、每个小组、每台机床都普遍地完成计划。实行作业计划和指示图表，就可以逐步接近这个境界。中型轧钢厂在一九五二年九、十、十一三个月，即未实行指示图表时，生产先松后紧，每月上旬与下旬产量相差百分之二十以上。实行指示图表以后，一九五三年二、三两个月每旬产量相差在百分之六以下，昼夜的生产情况也均衡了。
    4、使领导者从事务主义的泥坑中解放出来
    企业的领导者必须善于运用作业计划这种先进的科学的生产管理方法来组织生产，运用系统的职能机构，特别是生产调度机构来指挥生产，否则，必然陷入事务主义的泥坑。辛辛苦苦，忙忙碌碌，到头来是完不成任务的。中型轧钢厂在实行作业计划和指示图表以前，厂长及其他负责同志常常在晚间接到告急的电话，或者亲身到厂解决一些具体问题，例如轧滚不能用，备品供不上等等。自从实行作业计划，建立值班长专责制，实行按指示图表工作以来，工作上了轨道，有了预见性，不需厂长“事必躬亲”了。但这种领导方法目前还没有被鞍钢所有领导干部推广。譬如耐火材料厂因人员不足，由工段长、车间主任到厂部的领导干部全是长白班，既没有值班长制度，调度系统也不健全，所以领导很被动，解决问题不及时，产量质量都是白天好晚上坏。
    三、作业计划的编制检查和贯彻
    1、编制作业计划的原则
    （1）系统。作业计划和指示图表必须由上而下，系统地、有机地联系起来。近代企业的生产，是许多不同的环节、各种因素错综联系着的，编制作业计划时就必须适应这个特点。由管理机构的每月每周的作业计划到各车间工段的指示图表，都必须互相衔接，紧凑配合，层层保证，互不脱节，从而连成一串，结为一体，才能收到预期的效果。编排月、周、昼、夜和轮班的作业计划，是计划越来越具体、越准确的深入过程，它们相互间不能取消代替，而是层层保证。
    （2）全面。生产任务的作业计划和图表，是一切计划和图表的核心，但必须与运输、检修、动力、原材料供应的作业计划全面配合起来。如果单纯地、孤立地只抓紧生产厂矿生产任务的作业计划，而放松其他辅助部门和供应部门的作业计划，特别是检修及备品供应的计划，则生产计划必然落空。鞍钢在这方面作的很差，今年二月份薄板厂检修工作一月三变计划，即是一例。
    （3）准确。作业计划固然不可能要求它是绝对准确，百分之一百地完成，一点不能变动；但如果编制时细致地考虑问题，真正抓住了生产的规律，那就完全有可能争取最大限度的准确性。鞍钢曾因炼钢厂不能完全按钢种出钢，而向外订货，增加一部分钢锭作为周转，并尽量利用自己的储备钢锭来作调剂。这样就减轻了对轧钢各厂生产的影响。预见到计划有被打乱的可能，就要采取适当措施来补救。例如三选矿延期开工，精矿不能平衡，公司就曾利用回收的尾矿补足需要。三年来我们所遇到的打乱作业计划的因素，除不能按钢种出钢而外，还有订货变更多、检修计划不准确、备品供应不足、原材料供应无保证以及运输不正常等等。
    2、编制作业计划的根据
    基本的根据是最主要的，其他根据也是要考虑的。
    （1）基本根据：国家计划，订货分配表。
    （2）其他根据：检修计划，平均先进定额，设备能力及使用情况，原材料平衡（包括自用的成品、半成品），动力平衡，运输平衡，技术规程，安全规程，技术条件和生产程序，生产任务完成情
    况。
    3、检查的必要
    贯彻作业计划必须强调检查，尤其要有健全的调度机构来监督保证。四月八日人民日报的社论也曾指出：“但有了作业计划，还只是解决了问题的一半，真正要实现计划，还必须有一个中心机构去监督执行。因此，在制订作业计划的同时，必须先把生产调度责任制建立起来，……”调度室是每小时检查进度的，它掌握的范围是轮班和昼夜的作业计划。其他按日、按周、按月的作业计划，必须由企业厂矿、车间、班组依不同情况制就，分列计划和实际数量，算出完成百分比和累计数量，定期由专人专责进行检查。鞍钢在这方面作得还不够好，这次讨论计划后要加强和改进。
    4、贯彻的方法
    要贯彻作业计划，首先必须认识到作业计划是一种科学的先进的生产管理方法，它能正确地领导生产，具体地组织生产，贯彻各种规程制度，联系各个机构单元，深入到群众中去，以求最终实现计划管理，完成有节奏的均衡生产。它既是计划管理的中心环节，又是计划管理的集中表现。因此，首先要建立各种汇报制度、交接班制度、值班主任制、专责制，把作业计划当作任务交给各级生产干部，分层负责。其次，要通过作业计划，联系生产、运输、检修、动力、原材料供应的各种职能机构以及生产上厂与厂、车间与车间、工段与工段的不同单元，把它们组织起来。作业计划要像穿连着许多珍珠的丝线一样，起联贯的作用。最后，还要把作业计划用指示图表的形式使每个实际操作的工人人人心中有数，知道什么时间干什么活，每一小时要完成多少工作量。这样才能在生产链条最基本最原始的地方做起，以保证作业计划的完成。这一体会，是由鞍钢作业计划执行得较好的中型厂所启示的，现在鞍钢正推广他们的先进经验。
    不难明白，把作业计划单纯地肤浅地认为是编数字、划表格的看法是错误的。把作业计划交给生产管理员，或认为生产科长一人干就可以，也是错误的。
    四、几个思想问题
    鞍钢在推行作业计划和指示图表当中，曾发现几个错误思想和错误作法，这是必须批判的。
    1、条件论
    有的人认为作业计划既然要准确，那就应该等定额和原始记录完全准确以后才能实行。这是把问题绝对化的看法。定额并不是一成不变的，先进生产者的经验随时可以打破旧的定额。要求作业计划准确，并不是说要作到计划与实际丝毫没有差别。在事物发展的过程中，有些因素是没有预先发现或不易预先发现的，一定要在实践中才能逐渐认识。因此，不会有也不可能要求有绝对的准确性，而是要求并争取相当的但又是最大限度的准确性。
    又有人认为本单位生产复杂，设备和管理还成问题，所以不能实行作业计划和指示图表。他们说：“要实行指示图表，除非图表自动化。”这实质上是“取消主义”的思想。事实恰恰相反，情况的好转要经过人们主观的努力，而作业计划和指示图表就正是促成转变的有力武器。中型厂起初矫正滚的存储和使用是混乱的，实行指示图表，建立专人清点制以后就容易掌握了。而且，越是生产过程复杂的地方，越要实行作业计划和指示图表。我们不能想像机械总厂没有作业计划而能正常地工作。他们编制作业计划，需要有七个人由每月十日搞到二十五日才能作完。作业计划做得比较细致，生产过程包括面也较广的化工总厂和大孤山铁矿，其情形也与机械总厂相差不多。
    2、“分责制”
    由于不了解作业计划是一种先进的生产管理方法，由于对责任制的体会不深，某些人就把实行作业计划和检查作业计划当作党、行政、工会、青年团平摊的工作。弓长岭铁矿个别同志就有类似的看法。此外，关于作业计划归谁负责归谁领导，也有不同的看法。我们认为：应该是由行政上的生产副厂长领导作业计划，由生产科负责并作具体布置，党、工会、青年团协助、支持和监督，不能平摊责任，更不能代替行政。
    3、照抄
    根据鞍钢办作业计划人员训练班的经验，大多数学员都希望学一套现成的、拿回去就可以马上在本单位使用的作业计划制度和指示图表样式，因此对基本的意义和原则重视不够，认识不足。在铸管厂就曾发现有把日作业计划做好之后，就决定取消周作业计划的打算。在推广中型轧钢厂的经验时，也发现有些厂把中型轧钢厂的计划与图表原封不动照抄一份的作法。必须认识到作业计划和指示图表既是具体指导生产的行动指令，它的编制就一定要结合本单位的具体情况，把别的单位的经验照抄是行不通的。
