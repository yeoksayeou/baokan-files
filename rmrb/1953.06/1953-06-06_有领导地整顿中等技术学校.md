Response to Readers' Criticisms and Suggestions from the People's Daily

    Rectifying Secondary Technical Schools with Leadership
    The "Reader's Letters Summary" column published four letters in April from readers exposing the chaotic situation in secondary technical schools. Here are summaries of responses from relevant parties:

    Following the publication of three readers' letters titled "Secondary Technical Schools Should Be Rectified" on April 5th, the Education Department of the Central Heavy Industry Ministry's Central China Iron and Steel Company wrote: "The situation reflected by readers regarding the unclear educational policy of the Daye Iron and Steel Industry School is indeed factual. The school has now been placed under the leadership of our company's Education Department, and after adjustments and mergers, the problem no longer exists." The Hunan Provincial Finance Committee wrote: "The Hunan Jinyie Senior Commercial School was originally a private school with a very poor foundation and chaotic teaching. In 1951, the Finance Committee took over the school and decided to focus on training statistics cadres based on the situation at the time. However, due to the lack of dedicated personnel, a teaching plan was never established; and there were objective difficulties. Therefore, there was indeed chaos in the school's teaching work. In the second half of 1952, discussions were held with the Provincial Department of Culture and Education to rectify the school, but this was not realized due to changes in circumstances. Because the Finance Committee's scope of work is broad, and future work will focus on planning, it is unable to lead such schools, and there is a lack of cooperative cadres in the province. After research, it has been decided that from this semester, the school will be transferred to the Provincial Cooperative Affairs Administration to train cooperative cadres. The Finance Committee provided very poor specific leadership during its management of the school, which caused many problems. This is worth reflecting on." In addition,

    There has been no response yet to the letter of criticism that "Some students at Hangzhou Civil Engineering School changed majors three or four times in three years"; it is hoped that the school will quickly investigate and respond.

    The Shenyang Industrial Technical School also responded to the reader's letter of criticism published in this newspaper on April 24th. The letter stated: Our school's educational policy and nature were unclear, and the policy thinking of the school's leading cadres was weak, which led to the school being in a state of chaos for a long time, causing damage to the state's cause of training cadres. After an inspection by an inspection team jointly formed by the Education Bureau of the Northeast Administrative Committee, the Shenyang Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the Shenyang Municipal People's Government, the Party Committee of the Shenyang Municipal People's Government organs, and the Shenyang Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League, the relevant leading organs have appropriately resolved the problems existing in the school. Now, with the approval of the Ministry of Higher Education of the Central People's Government, students in our school's senior classes (equivalent to junior college level) who pass the examination have been adjusted to appropriate classes in universities and colleges to study; those who fail will be assigned work according to their wishes and enrolled in the school's intermediate classes or introduced to appropriate senior high schools to study. Our school's original intermediate classes will be transformed into secondary technical schools, and teaching plans will be formulated and organizational structures will be rectified in accordance with the regulations of the Central Ministry of Higher Education. The Shenyang Municipal People's Government has also appointed another vice-principal to be responsible for leading the school's daily work. Comrade Jiao Ruoyu, the principal of our school, and Comrade Jin Feiqing, the vice-principal, have made public self-criticisms for leading the school's work with a bureaucratic attitude in the past. Comrade Chen Ming, the vice-principal, was irresponsible and took a blind eye and even condoned the erroneous practices of some cadres in the school who treated young students with rude methods. The Shenyang Municipal People's Government Organs Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has decided to give him a disciplinary measure within the Party of removing him from his position as secretary of the branch, and suggested that the administrative side give him a dismissal. Other cadres who suppressed democracy and retaliated against students who offered opinions have also received due punishment.

### 有领导地整顿中等技术学校

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    有领导地整顿中等技术学校
    “读者来信摘要”栏在四月份发表了读者揭发中等技术学校混乱现象的来信四件，现将有关方面的答复摘要发表如下：
    四月五日以“应该整顿中等技术学校”为题的三封读者批评信发表后，中央重工业部华中钢铁公司教育处来信：“读者反映的大冶钢铁工业学校办学方针不明确的情况确系事实。现该校已划归我公司教育处领导，经过调整与合并工作，目前问题已不存在。”湖南省财经委员会来信：“湖南进业高级商业学校原系私立学校，基础很差，教学混乱。一九五一年由财委接办，根据当时情况决定以培养统计干部为方针。但因无专人负责，教学计划一直没订出；而客观上也有困难，因此该校教学工作中确有混乱现象。一九五二年下半年曾与省文教厅商量加以整顿，但因情况变化而未实现。因为财委业务范围广，今后工作又着重在计划工作上，对此类学校无力领导，而省内又缺乏合作干部。经研究，决定本学期起将该校移交省合作事业管理局接办，以培养合作干部。财委在接办该校期间具体领导很差，致使该校发生不少问题，这是值得检讨的。”此外，
    “杭州土木工程学校有些学生三年中改了三四次学科”的批评信，至今尚未答复；希望该校赶快检查答复。
    沈阳市工业技术学校对四月二十四日本报发表的读者批评信也作了答复，来信说：我校办学方针和性质不明确，学校领导干部的政策思想性弱，以致学校长期处于混乱状态，使国家培养干部的事业受到损失。经东北行政委员会教育局、中共沈阳市委会、沈阳市人民政府和市人民政府机关党委、青年团沈阳市委会联合组成的检查组进行检查，有关领导机关对学校存在的问题已作适当解决。现在，经中央人民政府高等教育部批准，我校高级班（相当于专科程度）的学生经过考试，凡合格者均已被调整到大专学校的适当班级去学习；未及格者则按其志愿分配工作，编入该校中级班或介绍到适当的高级中学学习。我校原有的中级班则办成中等技术学校，按照中央高等教育部的规定，制订教学计划，整顿组织机构。沈阳市人民政府并已另派一副校长负责领导我校日常工作。我校校长焦若愚同志、副校长金非青同志对过去以官僚主义态度领导学校工作的问题已作了公开检讨；副校长陈明同志工作不负责任，对学校某些干部一贯以粗暴手段对待青年学生的错误做法采取熟视无睹甚至纵容的态度，中共沈阳市人民政府机关委员会已决定党内给予撤销支部书记工作的处分，并建议行政方面给以撤职处分；其它压制民主、打击提意见学生的干部，也都受到应得的处分。
