Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, June 11th: Our special correspondent Wu Min reports: The plenary session of the delegation from both sides of the Korean Armistice Negotiations has been temporarily adjourned since the 10th. At 11:00 AM on the 11th, two groups of staff officers simultaneously held administrative meetings. For the first time, the staff officers of both sides entered the meeting hut with large bundles of maps. Another staff officer meeting, usually held in this hut to discuss administrative details, was moved to a large tent by the roadside.

Looking through the glass windows of the meeting hut, one could see Korean, Chinese, and American staff officers spreading maps on the table for a meeting. The changes to the military demarcation line must be precisely demarcated, and the demarcation line must be changed to conform to the current battle line in preparation for the signing of the armistice agreement.

In November 1951, a military demarcation line traversing Korea was drawn on the map. At that time, it took four days for the staff officers to agree on a military demarcation line, and the troops of both sides would withdraw two kilometers from the demarcation line to form a demilitarized zone. Since then, the military demarcation line has moved southward, especially on the western and central fronts.

    前年冬天以来朝鲜战线已经南移
    划定军事分界线必须与目前的战线相合
    【新华社开城十一日电】本社特派记者吴敏报道：朝鲜停战谈判双方代表团大会已自十日起暂行休会，十一日上午十一时有两组参谋人员同时举行行政性会议。双方的参谋人员第一次带着大捆地图进入会议小屋。通常在这个小屋里举行的讨论行政细节的另一参谋人员会议，改在路旁一个大帐篷里举行了。
    从会议小屋的玻璃窗里望进去，可以看到朝鲜的、中国的和美国的参谋人员正把地图摊在桌上开会。军事分界线的更动处必须精确地划定，必须把分界线改得与目前战线相合，以准备签订停战协定。
    一九五一年十一月，曾在地图上划定了一条横贯朝鲜的军事分界线。当时参谋人员费了四天工夫，同意了一条军事分界线，双方部队将从分界线各撤退两公里，以形成非军事区。自从那时以来，军事分界线已经南移，特别是在西线和中线。
