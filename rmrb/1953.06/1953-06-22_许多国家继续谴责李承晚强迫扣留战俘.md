Xinhua News Agency, June 21st: Many countries continue to condemn the US's connivance with the Syngman Rhee group's forced retention of prisoners of war, and demand that the US take effective action against this behavior.

Indian Prime Minister Nehru, who is presiding over a meeting of Indian envoys to European countries in Switzerland, issued a statement through his spokesperson on the 19th, saying that Syngman Rhee's "release" of prisoners of war was a "very regrettable and extremely objectionable thing." The spokesperson said that the meeting of Indian envoys to European countries believes that such destructive attempts by Syngman Rhee should not be allowed to hinder the agreement, and the United Nations Command, which bears the responsibility, should take effective action on this matter.

The "Delhi Express" said: The responsibility for Syngman Rhee's destructive actions "should largely be borne by the United Nations Command." The "Hindustan Times" said: The United Nations Command must not "turn a blind eye" to Syngman Rhee's actions of "releasing" prisoners of war, and "the current situation requires swift and decisive action."

According to Reuters, people in London are "increasingly angry and surprised" by Syngman Rhee's "release" of prisoners of war. A London international affairs observer pointed out that the response of the Korean and Chinese sides to this incident will particularly depend on "the attitude of the United States in handling this situation." This observer demanded that "the United States take action immediately." Former British Labor government Foreign Secretary Morrison condemned Syngman Rhee's "release" of prisoners of war, saying: "This behavior is intended to disrupt the armistice negotiations." Former British Labor government Secretary of State for War John Strachey asked in a statement: "Are we to lose more British lives in Korea, mainly to satisfy the purposes of a blind and crazy old man?"

The foreign correspondent of the British "Manchester Guardian" commented: "Why didn't the United Nations Command in Korea take steps in advance to prevent Syngman Rhee from releasing these prisoners of war... This is bound to make people suspect that the United States must have known Syngman Rhee's intentions in advance, and suspect that Syngman Rhee colluded with them to do this." The "Yorkshire Post" said: Syngman Rhee's move "should be listed as one of the most shameless acts in history." The "Western Mail and South Wales News" said: "For the sake of peace, Syngman Rhee should be removed from office immediately."

According to Agence France-Presse, Western representatives to the United Nations are "extremely worried" about Syngman Rhee's actions, "and they criticized the United Nations Command for giving the South Korean government the opportunity to undermine the armistice terms reached at Panmunjom."

In Japan, "Japan News" accused the United Nations Command of "committing dereliction of duty" in the Syngman Rhee government's reckless "release" of prisoners of war.

    许多国家继续谴责李承晚强迫扣留战俘
    【新华社二十一日讯】许多国家继续谴责美方纵容李承晚集团强迫扣留战俘，要求美方对这种行动采取有效的行动。
    正在瑞士主持印度驻欧洲各国使节会议的印度总理尼赫鲁，通过他的发言人十九日发表声明说，李承晚“释放”战俘是一件“很遗憾而且极其令人反对的事情”。发言人说，印度驻欧洲各国使节会议认为不应当让李承晚这种破坏企图来妨碍协议，负有责任的联合国军司令部应当在这件事情上采取有效的行动。
    “德里快报”说：李承晚的破坏行动的责任，“大部分应由联合国军司令部来担负”。“印度斯坦时报”说：联合国军司令部对李承晚“释放”战俘的行动决不能“放任不顾”，“当前的局势需要采取迅速与决定性的行动”。
    据路透社报道，伦敦方面人士对李承晚“释放”战俘事件“愈来愈觉得愤怒与惊讶”。伦敦国际问题观察家指出：朝中方面对这个事件的反应，将特别决定于“美国处理这个局势的态度”。这位观察家要求“美国马上采取行动”。前英国工党政府外交大臣摩里逊谴责李承晚“释放”战俘的行动说：“这种行为是打算捣乱停战谈判。”前英国工党政府陆军大臣约翰·斯特拉彻在发表谈话时问道：“是否要在朝鲜送掉更多英国人的性命，主要只是为了满足一个盲目而疯狂的老家伙的目的。”
    英国“曼彻斯特卫报”外交记者评论说：“朝鲜联合国军司令部为什么没有事先采取步骤来防止李承晚释放这些战俘呢……这势必会使人怀疑美国一定事先知道李承晚的意图，并且怀疑李承晚是和他们串通一气干出这个勾当的。”“约克郡邮报”说：李承晚的举动“应该列为历史上最无耻的举动之
    一”。“西方邮报和南威尔士新闻”说：“为了和平，应该立即叫李承晚下台。”
    据法新社报道，西方驻联合国代表团人士对李承晚的行动“极为忧虑”，“他们并批评联合国军司令部给予南朝鲜政府机会来破坏板门店达成的停战条款”。
    在日本，“日本新闻”指责联合国军司令部在李承晚政府不顾一切“释放”战俘事件中“犯了玩忽职守罪”。
