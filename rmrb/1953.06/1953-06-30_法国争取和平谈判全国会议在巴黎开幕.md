Xinhua News Agency, Paris, June 29th: According to TASS, the French National Conference for Peaceful Negotiations opened on the 27th in the Pleyel Hall in Paris.

Attending were representatives from various provinces of France, including prominent political and religious leaders, social figures, writers, lawyers, priests, workers, farmers, housewives, mothers of soldiers killed or wounded in Vietnam, and representatives of many political parties.

The conference agenda included the following issues: ending the war in Indochina and starting negotiations; peacefully resolving the German question; and what contribution France should make to easing international tensions.

Pierre Cot, member of the World Peace Council and member of the National Assembly, presided over the opening of the conference. He pointed out that easing international tensions does not equate to achieving peace. However, it can promote peaceful consultations, enable the resolution of outstanding issues, and promote disarmament. Pierre Cot called on those who were still hesitating to join the peace movement.

Parmentier, a representative of French Catholics, gave a report on the first item on the agenda. He demanded an immediate end to the war in Vietnam. He said that negotiations must be held to establish a new relationship between the French and Vietnamese peoples on the basis of granting Vietnam full independence and concluding mutually beneficial economic and cultural agreements with Vietnam. He said that a peaceful resolution of the Vietnam issue is beneficial to the French people because it would relieve France of the unbearable burden of military spending and allow France to find a large market in Indochina for the sale of its industrial products.

Professor Narl then spoke. He emphasized that France had initially recognized the government of President Ho Chi Minh as legitimate and had concluded a treaty with him, but later violated this treaty. Narl asked: What is France fighting this republic for now? France's honor demands an immediate end to this tragic act.

    法国争取和平谈判全国会议在巴黎开幕
    【新华社二十九日讯】据塔斯社巴黎讯：法国争取和平谈判全国会议于二十七日在巴黎普列叶大厅开幕。
    到会的有法国各省的代表，其中有著名的政治和宗教领袖、社会名流、作家、律师、教士、工人、农民、家庭妇女、在越南伤亡的军人的母亲以及许多政党的代表。
    会议议程包括下面几个问题：结束印度支那战争并且开始谈判；和平解决德国问题；法国对缓和国际紧张局势应有什么贡献。
    世界和平理事会理事、国民议会议员皮埃尔·戈特主持会议开幕。他指出：缓和国际紧张局势并不等于实现了和平。但是，它可以促成和平协商，使悬而未决的问题得到解决，并且促成裁减军备。皮埃尔·戈特号召那些还在犹豫不定的人们参加和平运动。
    法国天主教徒代表帕曼蒂尔就议程第一项作了报告。他要求立即停止越南战争。他说：必须举行谈判，以便在给予越南充分独立以及和越南缔结互利的经济和文化协定的基础上，建立法越两国人民新的关系。他说：和平解决越南问题对法国人民是有利的，因为这样可以使法国卸下不能胜任的军费重担，并且使法国可以在印度支那找到一个很大的市场，来销售它的工业产品。
    接着由纳尔教授发言。他强调指出：法国起先曾经承认胡志明主席的政府合法，并且和他缔结了条约，但是后来又破坏了这个条约。纳尔问道：现在法国和这个共和国作战，又是为了什么呢？法国的荣誉要求立即结束这种悲剧行径。
