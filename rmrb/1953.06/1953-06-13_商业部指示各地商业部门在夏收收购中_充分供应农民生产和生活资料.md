Xinhua News Agency, 12th. The summer harvest crops have been successively put on the market. In order to vigorously cooperate with the national purchasing work, the Central Ministry of Commerce issued instructions to commercial departments and specialized companies throughout the country on June 10, requiring them to make every effort to fully supply the needs of the broad masses of farmers for living and production materials in coordination with the summer harvest purchasing work.

    The instruction, in analyzing the summer harvest situation, stated: This year's tea and rapeseed harvests are good, silkworm cocoons are developing normally, and although wheat has suffered frost damage in some areas, non-disaster areas have had bumper harvests. Disaster areas have also greatly reduced the extent of the disaster due to timely rescue efforts. Therefore, on a national scale, this year's summer harvest is still very good. During the summer harvest season, farmers' purchasing power will increase seasonally, and the market will also experience a peak season. Therefore, commercial departments in various regions must closely cooperate with grain departments and cooperatives, vigorously supply daily necessities such as cloth, daily necessities, oil, salt, cigarettes, and coal in the producing areas, and conduct in-depth research on the needs of farmers' production materials and closely integrate with cooperatives to organize supply, in order to meet the expanded requirements of farmers' purchasing power, ensure the smooth completion of national procurement work, and further consolidate the worker-peasant alliance economically.

    The instructions also pointed out: State-owned commerce, in promoting the economic accounting system in the first quarter, had a tendency to not pay attention to market arrangements and not take care of the people's needs. Many varieties were out of stock in many areas and could not meet the people's needs. Therefore, all units must quickly check their business varieties, seize the opportunity to purchase goods and replenish supplies, in order to strengthen supply, improve operations, and further prepare for the peak season of autumn harvest.

    In order to gain experience and guide comprehensively, the instructions determined that the commercial bureaus of the five key wheat producing areas of Hebei, Shandong, Henan, Jiangsu, and Anhui should pay special attention to whether the listed prices and market prices are in line with the country's price policies; study whether the supply of living materials and production materials meets the needs of farmers in terms of quantity and variety, and how to meet these needs; try to absorb farmers' opinions and reflections in the purchasing and supply work; and report to the Central Ministry of Commerce in a timely manner, in order to facilitate unified control and research and lay the foundation for the larger-scale purchasing and supply work after the autumn harvest.

    商业部指示各地商业部门在夏收收购中
    充分供应农民生产和生活资料
    【新华社十二日讯】夏收作物，已陆续上市。为了大力配合国家收购工作，中央商业部在六月十日向全国各地商业部门及专业公司发出指示，要求在配合夏收收购工作中，尽一切努力充分供应广大农民对生活和生产资料的需要。
    指示在分析夏收情况时说：今年茶叶、菜籽收成良好，蚕茧发育正常，小麦虽有部分地区遭受霜灾，但非灾区则是丰收的，而灾区也因及时抢救，灾害程度大为减轻，所以在全国范围说，今年的夏收仍是很好的。在夏收季节中，农民购买力将有季节性的提高，市场也将出现一个旺季。因此，各地商业部门，必须与粮食部门及合作社密切配合，在产区大力供应布匹、日用百货、油、盐、纸烟、煤炭等生活资料，并深入研究农民生产资料的需要与合作社密切结合，组织供应，以满足农民购买力扩大的要求，保证国家收购工作的顺利完成，从经济上进一步巩固工农联盟。
    在指示中同时又指出：国营商业在第一季度推进经济核算制中，曾出现不注意安排市场，不照顾人民需要的偏向，有不少品种在不少地区发生脱销，满足不了人民的需要，因此各单位必须迅速检查自己的经营品种，应进货者抓紧进货、充实货源，以加强供应，改善经营，进一步为大秋旺季做好准备。
    为了取得经验，指导全面，指示中确定了河北、山东、河南、江苏、安徽等五个小麦重点产区的商业厅，应特别注意牌价市价和国家的价格政策是否符合；研究生活资料和生产资料的供应在数量上、品种上是否满足了农民的需要及如何来满足需要；尽量吸取农民在收购与供应工作中的意见和反映；按时向中央商业部汇报，以利统一掌握研究，为秋后更大规模的收购供应工作打下基础。
