The General Bureau of Power Management of the Ministry of Fuel Industry held a National Electricity Safety Work Conference in Beijing in mid-May. Since January of this year, many units in the national electricity industry have achieved success in safe production. However, overall, accidents are still numerous, and the safety situation has not fundamentally improved.

After summarizing the national electricity safety work situation, the conference also introduced the safety work experiences of Tangshan Power Plant, Shijingshan Power Plant, and other units. The conference pointed out that the key to fundamentally improving the safety situation in the future is that leading cadres must attach importance to safety work and thoroughly implement regulations and systems. The conference required that the directors and section chiefs of local administrative bureaus, directors and factory heads of electricity bureaus, and chief engineers must study the technical management regulations for the electricity industry and make necessary revisions to existing unsuitable regulations; stipulate that relevant employees must separately study the three regulations for operation, maintenance, and safe work, requiring every employee to consciously and skillfully work in accordance with the regulations; essential equipment specified in the technical management regulations should be added or improved in a planned and step-by-step manner based on specific circumstances; and each major administrative region's electricity administrative bureau must formulate a concrete plan for implementing regulations and systems within one month.

Currently, in the basic construction departments of the national electricity industry, safety work lacks a foundation. Many important construction areas have not established specialized safety work organizations, or they are not sound enough, and the regulations and systems are also incomplete. Now that the tense construction phase has arrived, the conference requires all basic construction departments to immediately strengthen safety work organizations, replenish personnel, and formulate the main security regulations to meet the requirements of the entire basic construction work development.

    电业管理总局
    召开全国电业安全工作会议
    中央人民政府燃料工业部电业管理总局五月中旬在北京召开了全国电业安全工作会议。今年一月份以来，全国电业有许多单位是取得安全生产成绩的。但是总的来说，事故还是很多，安全情况并没有达到基本好转。
    会议总结了全国电业安全工作情况后，还介绍了唐山发电厂、石景山发电厂等单位安全工作的经验。会议指出今后从根本上改善安全状况的关键，是在领导干部必须重视安全工作，彻底执行规程制度。会议要求各地管理局的局长、处长、电业局局长、厂长和主要工程师必须学习电业技术管理法规，对现有不合适的规程应作必要修正；规定有关职工必须分别学习运行、检修和安全作业三个规程，要求每一个职工做到自觉地、熟练地按照规程进行工作；技术管理法规中指出的必需设备，要根据具体情况有计划有步骤地添置或改善；各大行政区电业管理局必须在一个月内做出贯彻规程制度的具体计划。
    目前在全国电业的基本建设部门中，安全工作还没有基础，许多重要施工地区还没有设立安全工作的专责机构，或者有了而不够健全，规程制度也很不完整。现在施工紧张阶段已经到来，会议要求各基本建设部门必须立即加强安全工作机构，充实人员，制订主要的保安规程，以适应整个基本建设工作发展的要求。（据新华社讯）
