Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 3rd -- The Executive Committee of the British Communist Party issued a statement on May 29th, calling on all labor movement organizations to swiftly demand an immediate halt to the Korean War, and to demand negotiations with the Soviet Union without preconditions.

    The statement, published in the "Daily Worker," said that at this stage of peace efforts, an urgent warning must be issued. "An attitude hostile to peace efforts is not only openly revealed within the highest ruling circles in the United States, but is also reflected in some British individuals—including certain right-wing Labor Party members."

    The statement pointed out that Eisenhower's use of the Bermuda Conference to mock the world's demand, led by the Soviet Union, for a major power conference, was entirely "an attempt to reuse his consistent tactic of trying to form a united front of Western countries against the Soviet Union, in order to put forward conditions as an ultimatum, rather than intending to hold negotiations."

    The statement concluded by saying that British public opinion, in response to the peace efforts of the Soviet and Chinese governments, had used its pressure to make the current opportunity for peace a reality. "Now, more than ever, it is necessary to intensify the mobilization of people from all walks of life and strengthen their pressure in order to defeat the enemies of peace, achieve victory in the Korean armistice, and enable the major power conference to be held."

    要求立刻停止朝鲜战争
    英共执委会发表声明号召英国人民为实现朝鲜停战而斗争
    【新华社布拉格三日电】英国共产党执行委员会于五月二十九日发表声明，号召所有劳工运动组织迅速要求立刻停止朝鲜战争，并要求不事先提出条件而与苏联举行谈判。
    “工人日报”所刊载的这个声明说，在和平行动的现阶段，必须发出紧急警告。“敌视和平行动的态度不仅在美国最高级的统治集团里公然流露着，而且也反映在某些英国人士中——包括某些右翼工党人士在内。”
    声明指出，艾森豪威尔用召开百慕大会议来嘲弄以苏联为首的全世界对召开大国会议的要求，完全是“企图重新使用他的一贯的策略，尽力使西方国家组成对抗苏联的阵线，以便提出作为最后通牒的条件，而不是打算举行谈判”。
    声明结语说，英国舆论界响应苏联和中国政府的和平行动，曾运用它的压力使目前谋求和平的机会能够实现，“现在比过去任何时候更要加紧动员各阶层人民，并增强他们的压力，以便击败和平的敌人、取得朝鲜停战的胜利，使大国会议得以举行。”
