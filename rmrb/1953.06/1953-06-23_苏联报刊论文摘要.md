    All Efforts to Improve Inspection of Implementation
    The "Labor News" published an editorial on May 30, emphasizing that the implementation of bottom-up inspection is the main link in improving work. The following is an abstract:
    The Communist Party has always emphasized the great significance of checking implementation. Correct leadership not only means making correct decisions on how to deal with problems, but also means checking the implementation of those decisions. Without inspection, success in work is unimaginable. Without inspection, any decision, even the best one, is just a castle in the air and will not be implemented quickly and accurately.
    Being good at arranging inspections of implementation will increase the sense of responsibility of staff and prevent major accidents and mistakes in work. The inspection of implementation has great principled significance because it can actively help fight against various malpractices of bureaucracy and expose those who treat their duties with indifference and negligence and trample on the legitimate rights of the working people.
    The Communist Party teaches us that cadres should not only carry out top-down inspections of implementation, but also bottom-up inspections. This method of inspection is most effective because it is carried out with the help of the masses. Shortcomings in trade union work and economic work, and errors and mistakes of leaders are particularly easily detected by the masses. And when the masses criticize shortcomings, they also suggest the correct way to correct the work.
    Bottom-up inspections should be carried out at general meetings, production meetings, and trade union work summary meetings. In addition, this bottom-up inspection should also be carried out every quarter when a mass inspection of collective contracts is conducted.
    In order to make the inspection of implementation work play a practical role, inspection must be carried out not sporadically but regularly. Only in this way can shortcomings and their causes be discovered and eliminated in a timely manner, and valuable experience can be studied and promoted in a timely manner.
    Trade unions should attract a wide range of activists, factory committees, and trade union committees at the state level to participate in supervision and inspection of implementation. It should be stipulated that at every workers' congress and at every meeting of production organs, a report on the implementation of previous resolutions should be heard, which will help to carry out criticism and self-criticism and increase the responsibility of economic work leaders and trade union leaders for the realization of the suggestions that have been adopted.
      Propagandist Training Class
       The "Truth News" published an editorial on June 3, elaborating on how to improve the Party's
    propagandist training class. The following is an abstract:
    Everyone knows that the results of the political education of Communist Party members mainly depend on the cadre of propagandists. At present, the political level of Party members is constantly improving, and the vast masses of Party members are more eager to further and deeply master the Party's rich ideological theory and the Party's multifaceted political experience. Therefore, the requirements for our propagandists are also constantly improving. Propagandists should not stagnate at the original theoretical level. They should broaden their political horizons and constantly enrich their Marxist-Leninist knowledge. They must deeply understand the resolutions of the Party Congress and the plenary sessions of the Central Committee, because the policies formulated by our Party are expressed in these resolutions. Propagandists must be good at arming their listeners with profound Marxist-Leninist theory, explaining to them the inseparable link between revolutionary theory and the practical tasks of communist construction, and creatively, vividly and interestingly presenting materials related to this issue. The task of Party organizations is to make every effort to improve the leadership work of propagandist cadres, so that their theoretical cultivation and teaching methods tend to be perfect. The purpose of the training class is to give propagandists strong help in studying Marxist-Leninist theory and the policies of the Communist Party, and to give them thorough instructions on practical work issues in schools, groups, and classroom discussions. The training class must familiarize propagandists with the current tasks of local Party organizations in the fields of economic and cultural construction. In-depth study of practical problems in the training class will undoubtedly help propagandists greatly improve their work in schools and groups, make their work more purposeful, and closely link it with the urgent tasks of the Party in the current stage of communist construction.
    The responsibility of Party organizations is to ensure that the students sent to the training class are carefully selected, and that the best lecturers who teach the basic courses of Marxist-Leninist theory in Party schools and universities and leaders of classroom discussions, and lecturers and leading staff members of Party committees are selected to teach.
    The main thing is to make the lectures in the training class have a high ideological level, so that the lectures themselves become examples of creatively clarifying theoretical issues and closely linked with practical life. The Party committee should actively help lecturers prepare their speeches in the training class, discuss the original drafts of the lecture notes in a timely manner, and put forward advice to make the content of the lecture notes richer and more effective. The training class must help propagandists eliminate the factors of rote learning and formalism that still exist in their practical work.
    An important place in the work of the training class is to lead propagandists to hold classroom discussions. Classroom discussions can help them better grasp the subjects they have learned. Whenever such a discussion is held, students should first study the outline materials themselves, and then conduct classroom discussions with high enthusiasm in an atmosphere of creatively discussing theoretical issues.
    The Party Committee must ensure that the work of the training class is properly organized and that the study outlines are successfully taught. It must arrange effective learning conditions for students, regularly care about the progress of the courses, and take timely measures to eliminate shortcomings.

    苏联报刊论文摘要
    全力改进对执行的检查
    “劳动报”五月三十日发表社论，着重指出实行自下而上的对执行的检查，是改进工作的主要环节，摘要如下：
    共产党经常强调检查执行的重大意义。正确的领导，不仅是说要作出处理问题的正确决定，而且也意味着要对决定的执行进行检查。没有检查，工作的成绩是不可想像。没有检查，任何决定，甚至是最好的决定，也只是空中楼阁，不会执行得很快而又准确。
    善于安排对执行的检查将会提高工作人员对工作的责任感，并能防止工作中发生重大事故和过错。检查执行所以具有重大的原则性的意义，是因为它能积极帮助向官僚主义的各种歪风进行斗争，把凡是以冷漠和轻忽态度对待本身职务和践踏劳动人民合法权利的人们揭发出来。
    共产党教导我们干部不仅要实行自上而下的对执行的检查，而且要实行自下而上的检查。这种检查方式所以具有最大的效果，是因为在群众的帮助下进行的。工会工作和经济工作中的缺点，领导人的错误和失策，特别容易为群众所觉察。而当群众对缺点进行批评的时候，他们也就提示了改正工作的正确方法。
    自下而上的检查应在全体大会、生产会议、工会工作总结会议上进行。此外，在每一季度进行对集体合同作群众性检查时，也应进行这种自下而上的检查。
    为了要使检查执行工作发挥实际效果，必须不是间或地而是经常地进行检查。只有在这样的情况下，才能及时发现和消灭缺点及其起因，才能及时研究和推广宝贵的经验。
    工会应当吸引广大的积极分子、工厂委员会和州的工会委员会来参加监督和检查执行的工作。应当规定：在每一次工人大会上，在每一次生产机关的会议上，都应听取关于前次决议的执行情况的报告，这样就会帮助开展批评和自我批评，并提高经济工作领导人和工会领导人对实现已被采纳的建议的责任感。
      宣传员训练班
       “真理报”六月三日发表社论，阐述怎样改进党的
    宣传员训练班的问题，摘要如下：
    谁都知道，共产党员的政治教育成绩，主要取决于宣传员干部。目前，党员的政治水平在不断提高，党内广大群众更加渴望进一步深刻地掌握党的丰富的思想理论和党的多方面的政治经验，因此，对我们宣传员的要求也在不断提高。宣传员不应停滞在原有的理论水平。他应当扩大政治视野，不断地丰富自己的马克思列宁主义的知识。他必须深刻地了解到党代表大会和中央委员会全会的各项决议，因为我党所制定的政策就表现在这些决议中。宣传员必须善于以深刻的马克思列宁主义理论武装自己的听众，向他们说明革命理论和共产主义建设中的实际任务的不可分割的联系，并且创造性地，生动而有趣地提出有关这个问题的材料。党组织的任务就是要以全力改进对宣传员干部的领导工作，使他们的理论修养和讲授方法趋于完善。训练班的目的就是在钻研马克思列宁主义理论和共产党的政策方面给宣传员以有力的帮助，并在学校、小组和课堂讨论的实际工作问题上给他们以周密的指示。训练班必须使宣传员熟悉地方党组织在经济和文化建设领域中的当前任务。在训练班里对现实问题的深入研究，无疑地会帮助宣传员们大大改进他们在学校和小组中的工作，使他们的工作更具有目的性，并和共产主义建设现阶段中党的迫切任务密切联系起来。
    党组织的责任是在保证审慎地选送到训练班去的学员，应把党校和高等学校中讲授马克思列宁主义理论基础课程的最好的讲师和课堂讨论的领导者，党委会的讲师和领导工作人员选去教书。
    主要的是要使训练班的讲课具有高度思想水平，使这种讲课本身成为创造性地阐明理论问题的范例，并和实际生活密切联系。党委会应积极帮助讲师准备在训练班中的发言，及时地对讲义的原稿进行讨论，提出忠告，使讲义的内容更丰富和更有效果。训练班必须帮助宣传员来排除在他们的实际工作中仍然存在着的读死书和形式主义的因素。
    在训练班的工作中占有重要的地位的，就是领导宣传员举行课堂讨论。课堂讨论可以帮助他们更好地掌握所学的科目。每逢举行这种讨论的时候，应先由学员自行学习提纲材料，而后以高度积极的情绪，在创造性地讨论理论问题的气氛中进行课堂讨论。
    党委会必须保证使训练班的工作具有应有的组织性，使学习提纲顺利地讲授完毕。它必须为学员布置有效学习的条件，经常关怀课程的进行，及时采取措施来消灭缺点。
