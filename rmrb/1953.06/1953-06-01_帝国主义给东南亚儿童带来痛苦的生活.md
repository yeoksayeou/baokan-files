    Xinhua News Agency: Southeast Asian children are living a very painful life under the iron heel of imperialism. They are subjected to ruthless destruction and persecution, and even die directly under the bayonets of imperialism.
    The French colonialists, who have been waging a war of aggression in Vietnam for seven years, have been trying every possible means to kill and destroy Vietnamese children. On June 14, 1948, when the French aggressor troops attacked My Trach village in Quang Tri province, they captured one hundred children and killed them using extremely brutal methods. In October 1951, the French aggressor troops captured 16,000 residents from the three districts of Tien Hung, Duyen Ha, and Hung Nhan in Thai Binh province, and escorted them to Bo Thi, a prison camp made from a football field surrounded by five layers of barbed wire. Among these 16,000 people, there were many children and mothers holding babies, who were forced to stand in the open day and night. Sixty-eight babies died of starvation in their mothers' arms simply due to lack of milk. In the Hong Gai mining area, the French aggressor troops gouged out the eyes of a group of Vietnamese workers' children who were attending class, and also threw some people into the sea. In central Vietnam, French aggressor troops even raped ten-year-old girls. The atrocities of the French aggressor troops against Vietnamese children are too numerous to count.
    In the Philippines, an American colony, children also suffer the same misery. In December 1952, the Philippine Senate investigated the case of the massacre of villagers in Masico Village, Laguna Province, by the Philippine puppet army on November 28, 1947. A widow who survived at the time testified that she personally saw the bodies of three children and three women killed on the street that day. This is just one example of the countless atrocities committed by the US-Philippine reactionaries in massacring women and children.
    The crime of child trafficking is also rampant in the Philippines. Under the guise of "employment agencies," human traffickers, with Manila as their center of activity, lure and deceive girls from bankrupt farmers all over the country, taking them to the city to be sold as prostitutes. These human traffickers even kidnap female students on the streets of big cities.
    Due to the Philippine puppet government's increase in military budget and reduction in education expenditure under the direction of the United States, the number of Filipino children out of school, which accounts for 50 percent of school-age children, is expanding. According to Philippine newspapers, the number of students in public schools alone decreased by more than 500,000 in 1952 compared to 1951.
    In Thailand, 66 percent of children are out of school. Direct military appropriations account for 35 percent of the Thai budget, while education expenditure is less than 5 percent. In Thai cities, child laborers aged seven or eight work 12 to 14 hours a day like adult workers, but their wages are only one-tenth of those of adults. In rural areas, tenant farmers' children are often forced to work for landlords without pay. In 1952, a famine occurred in northeastern Thailand. The Phibun government continued to ship rice to South Korea for free to support the US war of aggression, but did not provide relief to the disaster areas, resulting in the starvation of many disaster victims and children.
    In Malaya, in the past five years, British colonialists have arbitrarily massacred and persecuted urban and rural residents in the bloody suppression of the Malayan national liberation movement; children have been subjected to their cruelty without exception. Even from the news occasionally revealed from Malayan newspapers, one can see a glimpse of the atrocities such as British planes attacking the town elementary school in Johor with rockets or British army sergeants shooting rural children in Perak with machine guns. On February 15, 1951, 1,000 British colonial troops surrounded Rengam Village in Selangor, razed all the houses in the village to the ground, and imprisoned all 1,725 residents of the village in concentration camps, including 565 children. Currently, 500,000 people in Malaya have been imprisoned by British colonialists in concentration camps called "New Villages." It is estimated that there are more than 100,000 Malayan children living in concentration camps surrounded by barbed wire.
    The lives of the vast majority of children in Malaya are very painful. In Singapore, the largest city in Malaya, families of workers and shop assistants usually occupy only the space of an ordinary wooden bed in dilapidated houses, or even live under staircases without sunlight. The "Straits Times" once reported that 70 percent of children aged four to six in Singapore suffer from tuberculosis due to malnutrition and poor living conditions. Because their parents' income is not enough to maintain their lives, many children are forced to become street vendors or beggars. They are constantly subjected to "sweeps" by British colonial police and are taken to "juvenile courts" for trial and punishment. In the villages of the Federation of Malaya, medicine and schools are generally lacking. According to British official statistics alone, more than 1,000 infants die each month. Children out of school account for 76 percent of school-age children.
    People all over the world sympathize with the plight of Southeast Asian children. The International Conference for the Defense of Children held in Vienna last April specially appealed for Southeast Asian children in distress in its "Letter to Men and Women All Over the World." The Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference held in Beijing last October passed a resolution on women's rights and children's welfare. The resolution specifically called for stopping the wars in Vietnam, Malaya and other countries, withdrawing foreign troops from those countries, and demanding that governments use war funds for the health, material and spiritual welfare of women and children.
    For the happiness of the next generation, and to enable children to grow up in a peaceful world, the broad masses of Southeast Asian people are fighting to defend children's rights, for national independence, and for world peace.

### 帝国主义给东南亚儿童带来痛苦的生活

    帝国主义给东南亚儿童带来痛苦的生活
    【新华社讯】东南亚千千万万的儿童正在帝国主义的铁蹄下过着十分痛苦的生活。他们受到无情的摧残和迫害，甚至直接死在帝国主义的刺刀之下。
    在越南进行侵略战争的法国殖民者，七年来一直千方百计地杀害和摧残越南儿童。一九四八年六月十四日，法国侵略军袭击广治省美泽村时抓住了一百个小孩，用各种极端凶残的方法把他们杀死。一九五一年十月，法国侵略军从太平省先兴、缘河、兴仁三个县抓去了一万六千居民，把他们押到波市
    一个有五层铁丝网围绕的足球场改的囚场里。这一万六千人当中，有许多儿童和抱着婴儿的母亲，他们被迫日以继夜地露天站立，单因缺乏乳汁而在母亲怀抱里活活饿死的婴儿就有六十八人。在红开矿区，法国侵略军把一群正在上课的越南工人子弟的眼睛挖去，还把一些人抛到海里。在越南中部，法国侵略军连十岁的小女孩也强奸。法国侵略军这种残害越南儿童的暴行，多得难以计算。
    在美国的殖民地菲律宾，儿童们也遭到同样的苦难。在一九五二年十二月，菲律宾参议院对一九四七年十一月二十八日菲律宾傀儡军在内湖省玛西科村屠杀乡村居民的案件进行调查。一个当时侥幸逃生的寡妇作证说：她当天亲眼在街上看到遇害的儿童和妇女的尸体各三具。这仅是美菲反动派擢发难数的屠杀妇女和儿童的暴行的一个例子而已。
    贩卖儿童的罪行在菲律宾也十分猖獗。在“职业介绍所”的招牌下，以马尼拉为活动中心的人口贩子到全国各地诱拐和骗取破产农民的女孩，把她们带到城市卖作娼妓。这些人口贩子甚至在大城市的马路上绑架女学生。
    由于菲律宾傀儡政府在美国指使下增加军事预算和削减教育费的支出，占学龄儿童百分之五十的菲律宾失学队伍正在扩大。据菲律宾报纸刊载：仅仅是公立学校，一九五二年的学生人数就比一九五一年减少了五十多万人。
    在泰国，百分之六十六的儿童失学。直接军事拨款占泰国预算的百分之三十五，而教育费却不到百分之五。在泰国的城市，七、八岁的童工和成年工人一样每天工作十二到十四小时，而他们的工资却只有成年人的十分之一。在乡村，佃农的儿女常常被迫替地主作没有报酬的劳动。一九五二年，泰国东北部发生饥荒，銮披汶政府继续免费运大米到南朝鲜支持美国侵略战争，却不救济灾区，以致许多灾民和儿童饿死。
    在马来亚，近五年来英国殖民者在血腥镇压马来亚民族解放运动中，恣意屠杀和迫害城市和乡村的居民；儿童们毫无例外地遭到毒手。即使从马来亚的报纸偶然透露出来的消息中，也可以看到英国飞机用火箭炮袭击柔佛州的市镇小学校或英军军曹用机枪射杀霹雳州的乡村儿童等暴行的一斑。一九五一年二月十五日，英国殖民军一千名包围雪兰莪州的仁加榄村，夷平了该村的所有房屋，把全村一千七百二十五名居民押到集中营里囚禁，其中儿童有五百六十五人。现在全马来亚已经有五十万人被英国殖民者关禁在名叫“新村”的集中营里。在集中营的带刺铁丝网环绕中生活的马来亚儿童，估计约有十多万人。
    马来亚绝大多数儿童的生活十分痛苦。在马来亚最大的城市新加坡，工人和店员的家庭通常一家几口在破旧的房屋里只占一张普通木床的地方，甚至住在不见阳光的楼梯底下。“海峡汇报”曾经报道过：由于营养不良和居住环境恶劣，新加坡四岁到六岁的儿童有百分之七十染上肺痨。由于父母的收入不够维持生活，许多儿童被迫到街头作小贩或作乞丐。他们不时遭到英国殖民警察的“扫荡”，并被带到“少年法庭”去受审讯和惩罚。在马来亚联邦的乡村里，医药和学校都普遍缺乏。仅据英国官方的统计，夭折的婴儿每月有一千多名。失学儿童占学龄儿童的百分之七十六。
    全世界人民都同情东南亚儿童的处境。去年四月间在维也纳举行的国际保卫儿童大会，在“告全世界男女书”里特别为在苦难中的东南亚儿童呼吁。去年十月间在北京举行的亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议，通过了关于妇女权利与儿童福利问题的决议。决议特别要求制止越南、马来亚及其他国家的战争，撤退那些国家的外国军队，并要求各国政府把战争款项改用在妇女儿童的卫生、物质和精神的福利事业。
    为了下一代的幸福，为了使儿童能够在和平世界里成长，广大的东南亚人民正为保卫儿童权利、为民族独立、为世界和平而斗争。
