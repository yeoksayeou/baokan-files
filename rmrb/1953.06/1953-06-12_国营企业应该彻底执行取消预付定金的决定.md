Brief commentary on economic life:

    In September 1952, the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council issued a decision: State-owned enterprises should not pay advance deposits to each other for transactions, and state-owned enterprises should limit advance deposits to private enterprises to 25%. Most state-owned enterprise departments in various regions have conscientiously implemented this decision, but some enterprise units have violated it. Recently, more than 70 units in Beijing were found not to have complied with this decision.

    Paying advance deposits between state-owned enterprises, or state-owned enterprises paying excessive deposits to private enterprises, are both improper commercial credit behaviors that will seriously affect the economic accounting system of state-owned enterprises. State-owned enterprises have approved funds, which fully guarantees the needs of enterprise units for working capital for production and operation. If an enterprise unit demands undue deposits from ordering units, Party A will have surplus funds, resulting in backlogs; Party B will inevitably pay advance deposits in addition to the normal reserve quota, bearing interest for a long time, which is not in accordance with the principle of economy. This will disrupt the enterprise's financial system, making it impossible to control capital management, and will inevitably cause serious backlogs and waste of state funds.

    Why have these enterprise units not thoroughly implemented the decision to abolish advance deposits? The main reason is that these enterprises have not implemented or are unwilling to implement economic accounting, which is completely wrong. Banks at all levels should strengthen supervision of enterprises through loan and settlement systems, and gradually concentrate credit in banks to facilitate the promotion of the enterprise economic accounting system.

    国营企业应该彻底执行取消预付定金的决定
    一九五二年九月，政务院财政经济委员会曾发布决定：国营企业与国营企业之间交易往来不应预付定金，国营企业与私营企业之间交易往来限定预付定金百分之二十五。各地多数国营企业部门认真地执行了这一决定，但有部分企业单位却违反了这个决定。最近北京市就曾发现有七十多个单位没有遵守这个决定。
    国营企业之间交易往来预付定金，国营企业向私营企业预付过多的定金，都是不正当的商业信用行为，它将严重地影响国营企业的经济核算制。国营企业核定了资金，这就充分保证了企业单位生产和经营的资金周转的需要。如果企业单位向订货单位索取不应有的定金，甲方就会资金过剩，造成积压；乙方必然在正常的储备定额以外支付预付定金，长期负担利息，这是不合乎节约原则的。这会使企业财务制度发生紊乱现象，使资金管理无法控制，必然造成国家资金的严重积压和浪费。
    这些企业单位为什么没有彻底执行取消预付定金的决定呢？主要是因为这些企业还没有实行或者不愿意实行经济核算，这是完全错误的。各级银行应该通过放款和结算制度，加强对企业的监督，逐步集中信用于银行，以利企业经济核算制的推行。
