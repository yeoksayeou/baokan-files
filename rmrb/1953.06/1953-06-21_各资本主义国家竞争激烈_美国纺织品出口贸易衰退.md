Xinhua News Agency, New York, 18th. Concurrent with the depression in the domestic textile industry, American textiles are also becoming increasingly sluggish in foreign markets.

Matthew J. Carffee, Chairman of the American Textile Export Association, commented on the decline in American textile exports at the association's annual meeting earlier this month, saying: American textiles are facing a situation where the situation during the Great Economic Panic of the 1930s is reappearing, that is, all capitalist countries are desperately competing with each other, restricting trade and creating foreign exchange difficulties.

Carffee pointed out: In the international textile trade market, the United States has gradually fallen from its position as the leader in 1952 to behind Britain and Japan. Especially in Africa and the Far East, the Indian textile industry, mainly controlled by British merchants, has become a "powerful opponent" of American textiles. Carffee said that, with the exception of Canada, most of the countries that are so-called natural markets for American textiles are now reducing imports of American goods, and reducing them to less than at any time since the end of World War II. He also said that it is particularly "depressing" that even the Philippines, Indonesia, and Cuba, countries that have always imported large quantities of American textiles, have now greatly reduced their imports of American textiles. He complained that many of these countries are "either implementing excessive tariff protection, or stipulating import quotas, or simply prohibiting imports."

Carffee was very pessimistic when predicting the future of American textile exports, saying: "There is no sign now to indicate that this situation will improve in any way." He pointed out that "many countries are now suffering from economic weakness." He said: The root of the problem in the capitalist world's textile industry lies in the reduction in consumption in "certain densely populated areas" of the world. Carffee estimates that the export volume of American cotton fabrics this year may decrease by more than 27% compared to last year.

### 各资本主义国家竞争激烈  美国纺织品出口贸易衰退

    各资本主义国家竞争激烈
    美国纺织品出口贸易衰退
    【新华社十八日讯】纽约消息：与国内纺织业萧条同时，美国纺织品在国外市场上也愈来愈不景气。
    美国纺织业出口协会主席马修·杰·卡菲本月初在该协会年会上对美国纺织品出口贸易衰退发表评论说：美国纺织品正面临三十年代大经济恐慌时的情况重新出现的局面，就是各资本主义国家都拚命互相竞争，互相限制贸易和制造外汇困难。
    卡菲指出：美国在纺织品国际贸易市场上，已从一九五二年占第一把交椅的地位逐渐下落到英国和日本两国之后。特别是在非洲和远东方面，主要由英商操纵的印度纺织业已成为美国纺织品“有力的敌手”。卡菲说：除了加拿大以外，大多数所谓美国纺织品的天然市场的国家现在都减少美国货入口，而且减少到比第二次世界大战结束以来任何一个时期都要少。他又说：特别“令人颓丧”的是，连菲律宾、印度尼西亚和古巴这些向来输入美国大量纺织品的国家，现在都大大削减了美国纺织品的入口。他抱怨说：许多这些国家“不是实行过份的关税保护，便是规定入口限额，或者干脆禁止入口”。
    卡菲在预测美国纺织品出口贸易的前途时十分悲观地说：“现在没有什么迹象足以表明这种情况会有任何的改善。”他指出“很多国家现在都患着经济虚弱症”。他说：资本主义世界纺织工业的问题的根源，在于世界上“某些人烟稠密的地区”的消费量的减少。卡菲估计：美国今年棉织品的出口量可能比去年再减少百分之二十七以上。
