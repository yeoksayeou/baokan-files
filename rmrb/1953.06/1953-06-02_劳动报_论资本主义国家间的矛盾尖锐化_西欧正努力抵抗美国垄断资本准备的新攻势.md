Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, June 1st: TASS reported that the "Labor Daily" published an economic commentary by Torolev.

The commentary stated: The infighting within the U.S.-British bloc has become a central theme in all newspapers in Western Europe and the United States, with both sides attacking each other relentlessly.

The intensification of friction and hostility is primarily due to the increased competition among imperialist countries in the world capitalist market.

The interests of monopolies in seeking maximum profits are irreconcilable. On the one hand, U.S. monopoly capital wants to sell large quantities of goods to other capitalist countries, but at the same time, it refuses to open its domestic market to goods from other countries. As a result, from 1946 to 1952, the total dollar shortage incurred by capitalist countries in trade with the United States was nearly $32 billion.

Naturally, such "trade" is unfavorable to America's partners and is depleting their gold and dollar reserves. Except for Denmark, Western European countries must import approximately $2 billion worth of food products and raw materials annually. Before World War II, they imported most of these products from the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries, while exporting their own industrial machinery and other products in exchange. This resulted in a balance of trade and payments. A strong proof of the breadth and importance of this economic connection is that before the war, nearly one-third of Western Europe's trade was conducted with the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries.

Due to the pressure from U.S. monopoly capital, trade between Western Europe and Eastern Europe has now been disrupted. The one-sided and unnatural development of the world capitalist market has caused serious currency crises and foreign trade deficits in Western European countries. "Trade, not aid" has become a popular slogan in Western Europe today. However, U.S. monopoly capital does not intend to satisfy the wishes of its Western European competitors. On the contrary, it is preparing to launch a new offensive. In this situation, Western European countries can only try to resist further pressure from U.S. capital.

Currently, it can be said that there is no colony or semi-colony where U.S. monopoly capital is not squeezing out other colonial powers. The struggle for cheap labor and raw material markets is an important reason for infighting among imperialist countries.

Recently, very serious differences among Western countries have been manifested in the so-called rearmament of Western European countries. Huge military expenditures are draining their finances, exacerbating inflation, and undermining their economies.

The external contradictions of capitalist countries have been further intensified by internal contradictions, the intensification of class struggle, the rise of the strike movement, and the vigorous development of national liberation movements in colonies and dependent countries.

    “劳动报”论资本主义国家间的矛盾尖锐化
    西欧正努力抵抗美国垄断资本准备的新攻势
    【新华社一日讯】塔斯社莫斯科讯：“劳动报”刊载了托罗列夫的一篇经济评论。
    评论写道：美英集团的内讧已经成了西欧和美国所有报纸的主题，双方彼此攻击，各不相让。
    摩擦与敌对的尖锐化，主要是由于帝国主义国家在世界资本主义市场上竞争的加剧。
    争取最大限度利润的垄断资本之间的利益，是不能调和的。美国垄断资本一方面要向其他资本主义国家推销大批货物，但同时它们又拒绝对其他国家的货物开放它们的国内市场。因此，从一九四六年至一九五二年，资本主义国家在与美国贸易中发生的美元短缺总额已近三百二十亿美元。
    自然，这样的“贸易”是不利于美国的伙伴的，并且还在耗尽它们的黄金和美元的储备。除了丹麦之外，西欧国家每年必须输入约值二十亿美元的粮食产品和原料。在第二次世界大战以前，它们从苏联和东欧国家输入大部分上述的产品，同时输出它们自己的工业的机器和其它产品作为交换。结果得到了贸易和支付上的平衡。这种经济联系的广度和重要性的有力证明是：在战前，西欧差不多三分之一的贸易是与苏联和东欧国家进行的。
    由于美国垄断资本的压力，现在西欧与东欧的贸易已经被破坏了。世界资本主义市场的单方面的、不自然的发展，在西欧国家之中引起了严重的币制危机与对外贸易的逆差。“要贸易，不要援助”已经成为今日西欧流行的口号。不过美国垄断资本并不打算满足它的西欧竞争者的愿望。相反地，它正准备发动一个新的攻势。在这种情况下，西欧国家只有设法抵抗美国资本的进一步的压力。
    在目前，可以说没有一个殖民地和半殖民地国家没有美国垄断资本在那里把其他殖民国家排挤出去。争夺廉价劳动力和原料市场的斗争，是帝国主义国家间内讧的一个重要原因。
    最近在所谓西欧国家重整军备的问题上，表现出西方国家之间的非常严重的分歧。庞大的军备费用正在使它们的财政枯竭，使通货膨胀恶化，并破坏它们的经济。
    资本主义国家的外在矛盾已因内在矛盾、阶级斗争的尖锐化、罢工运动的高涨、殖民地和附属国家民族解放运动的蓬勃开展而更加尖锐了。
