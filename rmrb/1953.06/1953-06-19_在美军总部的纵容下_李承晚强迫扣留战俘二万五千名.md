    Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 18th. Special correspondent Jiang Nan reports: From late night on the 17th to early morning on the 18th, with the connivance of the US side, the Syngman Rhee gang simultaneously "released" 25,000 non-directly repatriated Korean People's Army prisoners of war from four prisoner-of-war camps in Nonsan, Masan, Busan, and Sangmudae on the South Korean mainland. According to the agreement on the repatriation of prisoners of war signed ten days ago, these captured personnel should have been transferred to the custody and management of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission within two months after the armistice. The Syngman Rhee gang claimed to be "releasing" them, but in reality, they were colluding internally and externally to use force and espionage to coerce them to leave the prisoner-of-war camps and forcibly incorporate them into the Syngman Rhee puppet army. An Associated Press dispatch from Busan on the 18th stated that "South Korean senior military authorities said that most of the 25,000 prisoners of war released will be incorporated into the South Korean army" in order to achieve the purpose of forcibly detaining them.
    The US military headquarters in Tokyo issued a statement today, placing all the responsibility for this serious incident of violating the agreement on the Syngman Rhee gang. According to the statement, the incident was planned and organized by senior officials of the Syngman Rhee government in collusion with South Korean guards.
    However, many facts can prove that the US military headquarters cannot shirk its serious responsibility for this incident. Syngman Rhee said today when announcing his order to release these prisoners of war: "Most of the United Nations military authorities with whom I have discussed our desire to release these prisoners sympathize with us and, in principle, agree with us." The Syngman Rhee gang has been clamoring to "release" these prisoners of war for a long time. On June 9th, Syngman Rhee's "National Assembly" passed a resolution to "immediately release all Korean prisoners of war who refuse repatriation and send the Chinese prisoners of war who refuse to return home to Taiwan." This was clearly known to the US side. Moreover, the South Korean guards responsible for guarding these four prisoner-of-war camps were commanded by American officers. Although the US side clearly knew that the Syngman Rhee gang was preparing to "release" these prisoners of war, the US side did not take any measures to prevent this incident from happening. The US side did not send American troops to replace the South Korean guards until the Syngman Rhee gang had already "released" 25,000 prisoners of war. This precisely proves that the US side intentionally connived with the Syngman Rhee gang to violate the agreement on the repatriation of prisoners of war. Now, the whole world is watching how the US government will handle this incident, which is a serious test of the US government's sincerity for an armistice.

### 在美军总部的纵容下  李承晚强迫扣留战俘二万五千名

    在美军总部的纵容下
    李承晚强迫扣留战俘二万五千名
    【新华社开城十八日电】本社特派记者江南报道：在十七日深夜到十八日早晨，美方纵容李承晚匪帮从南朝鲜大陆上的论山、马山、釜山、尚武台四个战俘营同时“释放”了二万五千名不直接遣返的朝鲜人民军被俘人员。这些被俘人员，按照十天前签订的关于战俘遣返问题的协议，是应该在停战后两个月内移交给中立国遣返委员会看管和处理的。李承晚匪帮说是“释放”他们，实际上就是里应外合地使用武力和特务胁迫他们离开战俘营，把他们强编到李承晚伪军中去。美联社釜山十八日电就说，“南朝鲜高级军事当局说，被释放的两万五千名战俘中大部将被编到南朝鲜军队中去”，以达到强迫扣留他们的目的。
    东京的美军总部在今天发表声明，把这个破坏协议的严重事件的责任全部推在李承晚匪帮身上。据这个声明说，这次事件是李承晚政府高级官员串通了南朝鲜卫兵有计划组织的。
    但是许多事实可以证明，美军总部是绝不能推卸对这一事件的严重责任的。李承晚今天在宣布他下令释放这批战俘时就说：“凡是我曾和他谈过我们希望释放这些俘虏的大多数联合国军方面的当局人士，都是同情我们并且在原则上赞成我们的。”李承晚匪帮好久以来就叫嚷着要“释放”这些战俘。六月九日，李承晚的“国民议会”通过一项决议，要“立即释放所有拒绝遣返的朝鲜战俘，并把拒绝回家的中国战俘送到台湾去”。这是美方明明白白知道的。而且，负责看管这四个战俘营的南朝鲜卫兵是由美国军官指挥的。美方虽然明明知道李承晚匪帮准备“释放”这些战俘，但美方并没有采取任何措置来防止这一事件的发生。美方直到李承晚匪帮已经“释放”了二万五千名战俘之后，才派美国军队去接替南朝鲜卫兵。这恰恰证明美方是有意纵容李承晚匪帮破坏关于战俘遣返问题的协议。现在，全世界都看着美国政府怎样来处理这一事件，它是对美国政府停战诚意的严重考验。
