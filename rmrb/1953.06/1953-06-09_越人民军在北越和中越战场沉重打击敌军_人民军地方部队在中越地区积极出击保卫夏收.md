Xinhua News Agency, 8th Dispatch: According to the Vietnam News Agency on the 7th, the local forces of the Vietnamese People's Army, fighting heroically in the North and Central Vietnamese regions, continue to annihilate many French troops in offensives and defensive battles.

After the French army was attacked in the Dong Quan area south of Hanoi in early May, it concentrated five battalions on May 9th, supported by aircraft and artillery, and advanced into the Liannan guerrilla zone in Ha Dong Province. After four days of fighting, the local forces of the People's Army and the guerrillas heroically repelled the French army's attack, killing and wounding 265 French troops, destroying one enemy armored vehicle and three trucks, and capturing many guns and equipment.

The local forces of the People's Army operating in Quang Nam Province in Central Vietnam launched an attack on the French army in Sui Chuan County on the night of May 16th, removing two enemy strongholds. The French army sent reinforcements in fifty trucks the next day. The People's Army intercepted this French force on the highway, annihilating two enemy companies and capturing more than 100 people, one-third of whom were European and African mercenaries. The People's Army also destroyed eight French trucks, captured one cannon, seven heavy machine guns, and more than 100 machine guns and submachine guns. In the battle, the People's Army also shot down a French aircraft.

Xinhua News Agency, 8th Dispatch: According to the Vietnam News Agency on the 6th, the local forces of the People's Army operating in the Quang Binh, Quang Tri, and Thua Thien regions of Central Vietnam have recently launched active attacks to defend the summer harvest and prevent the French invading forces from destroying and looting grain.

In Quang Binh Province, the local forces of the People's Army have crushed many "sweeps" launched by the French army to destroy grain in the Sui Xian Ninh area, killing and wounding many French troops. At the same time, the People's Army took the initiative to attack, removing five French strongholds and camps in Quang Ninh County.

In Quang Tri Province, the local forces of the People's Army carried out eleven battles in the first ten days of May, including removing a French stronghold near Mei Zhen, liberating many Vietnamese youths who had been forced into serving as cannon fodder.

The local forces of the People's Army also actively helped local residents organize shock harvest teams and mutual aid groups to quickly harvest crops to prevent the grain from falling into the hands of the enemy.

Prior to this, the local forces of the People's Army in the Quang Binh, Quang Tri, and Thua Thien regions had carried out many counter-"sweep" battles and ambush battles, striking at the French army's conspiracy to destroy grain and forcibly conscript soldiers. According to a communique from the Fourth War Zone Command, in more than a month from March to early April, the People's Army in the Quang Binh, Quang Tri, and Thua Thien regions annihilated a total of 744 French troops, capturing many guns, ammunition, and equipment.

    【新华社八日讯】据越南通讯社七日讯：在北越和中越地区英勇作战的越南人民军地方部队在出击和防御战中，继续歼灭许多法军。
    法军自五月初在河内以南的同关地区遭到打击以后，曾在五月九日集中部队五个营，由飞机和大炮支援，向河东省的联南游击区进犯。人民军地方部队和游击队经过四天作战，英勇地打退了法军的进攻，打死和打伤法军二百六十五人，击毁敌军装甲车一辆和卡车三辆，缴获许多枪支和装备。
    在中越广南省作战的人民军地方部队，曾在五月十六日夜向绥川县的法军发动进攻，拔除敌军据点两处。法军在第二天派了五十卡车的援军前往增援。人民军部队在公路上截击了这支法军，歼灭敌军两个连，俘掳一百多人，其中有三分之一是欧非籍雇佣兵。人民军并击毁法军卡车八辆，缴获大炮一门、重机枪七挺、机枪和冲锋枪一百多支。在战斗中，人民军还打落法机一架。
    【新华社八日讯】据越南通讯社六日讯：在中越广平、广治、承天地区作战的人民军地方部队最近积极出击，保卫夏收，防止法国侵略军队破坏和抢劫谷物。
    在广平省，人民军地方部队曾粉碎了法军向绥咸宁地区发动的破坏谷物的多次“扫荡”，打死打伤许多法军。人民军同时主动出击，拔除了广宁县的法军据点和营地五处。
    在广治省，人民军地方部队在五月初的十天中进行了十一次战斗，其中包括拔除美真附近的一个法军据点，解放了许多被拉去充当炮灰的越南青年。
    人民军地方部队还积极帮助当地居民组织突击收获队和变工组，迅速抢收，以避免谷物落到敌人的手里。
    在此以前，广平、广治、承天地区的人民军地方部队曾进行了多次的反“扫荡”战和伏击战，打击法军破坏谷物和强拉壮丁的阴谋。据第四战区司令部的公报说，从三月到四月初的一个多月中，人民军在广平、广治、承天地区一共歼灭法军七百四十四人，缴获许多枪支、弹药和装备。
