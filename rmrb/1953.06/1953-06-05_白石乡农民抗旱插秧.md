Baishi Township Farmers Fight Drought to Transplant Rice Seedlings
By Our Wuhan Reporter Gao Changren

This spring plowing season, the farmers of Baishi Township, Xishui County, Hubei Province, after land reform, have an unprecedentedly high level of enthusiasm for production. They built a reservoir at the foot of Baishi Mountain and six sluice gates in the Changgang River that runs through the township. They selected the "Victory Xian" high-quality rice variety for 80% of the cultivated land and applied sufficient base fertilizer to the fields. All 67 mutual aid teams in the township have been rectified and implemented mutually beneficial policies. The prospect of a bumper harvest in the fall encouraged the farmers of Baishi Township to work hard on spring plowing.

However, since last winter, there has not been a heavy rain in Baishi Township. By early May, the drought was already very serious. The south wind blew all day long, and the sun changed the color of the wheat in the fields day by day. Many of the newly planted cotton seeds failed to sprout, and some died after sprouting. In the earliest transplanted paddy fields, only a shallow layer of water remained. The water in the ponds was also running low. The water in the Changgang River at the Xu Family Sluice had stopped flowing. The Baishi Mountain Reservoir was also not filled with water. Many farmers were anxiously looking at the fields several times a day. After the Beginning of Summer, it still did not rain, and the farmers' thoughts began to become confused, and some lost confidence.

At this time, the leading organs of Xishui County issued emergency instructions on drought resistance, and county and district cadres came to Baishi Township to help with drought resistance. They brought hope to the farmers. The Baishi Township Branch of the Chinese Communist Party held several emergency meetings to study the instructions of the higher authorities, analyze the ideological situation of the masses in the township, summarize the experience of farmers in drought resistance over the years, and propose specific drought resistance measures such as strengthening the management of water conservancy institutions, using water rationally and sparingly, finding water sources, and preparing drought-resistant grain seeds. The branch called on party members to play a leading role in drought resistance. The fourteen party members in the township, under the leadership of the branch, were assigned to lead seven mutual aid team networks, and led the farmers to launch a drought resistance struggle with their own practical actions.

Last winter, party member Zhan Quan listened to the labor model of Wanggang District introduce the method of "duo yang" (raising seedlings and transplanting seedlings) at the labor model meeting in Xishui County. This time, he took the lead in transplanting dense rice seedlings in one mu of watered field in the mutual aid team, preparing to transplant them to other fields after heavy rain. Party members Zhan Chengyou and Wang Hongcun dug two large sand ponds in the already dry Changgang River at the Xu Family Sluice, and water seeped out of the ponds. They found the source of water. The sand pond dug by Wang Hongcun can save the seedlings of ten mu of fields. Party member Wang Kunzhi led his mutual aid team members to discuss the plan for planting dry land grain. He took out seven sheng of sorghum that he had prepared for making baba as seeds and bought seven jin of sweet potato seedlings. With the specific help of branch secretary Wang Youbing, the fish pond was well managed, and not a drop of water has been wasted so far, and no water disputes have occurred. The experience of managing this pond was quickly accepted by the heads of the five nearby ponds. They also managed the five ponds very well. Each village in the township also held many symposiums for old farmers, and many valuable drought resistance experiences were discovered, summarized, and promoted. This increased the drought resistance confidence of the farmers throughout the township.

On the night of May 10th, a small rain of one inch deep fell. The Party branch called on all farmers in the township to seize the opportunity and rush to transplant rice seedlings. At this time, the ponds were all open, and countless waterwheels were constantly turning by the ponds and within the canals, and white water poured into the newly turned paddy fields. The area of transplanted rice seedlings increased day by day. In four days, the township expanded from only 5% of the area transplanted to 86%.

    白石乡农民抗旱插秧
    本报武汉记者站  高长任
    今年春耕季节，土地改革后的湖北省浠水县白石乡的农民，生产情绪空前高涨。他们在白石山脚下修了一座水库，在横贯全乡的长港中修了六道水闸。他们在百分之八十的耕地上选用了“胜利籼”优良稻种，在田里上足了底肥。全乡六十七个互助组都经过了整顿，贯彻了互利政策。秋季丰产的远景，鼓舞着白石乡农民紧张地进行春耕。
    但是从去冬以来，白石乡没有落过一场大雨。到了五月上旬，旱象已很严重了。南风成天刮着，太阳晒得田里的麦子一天变一个颜色。刚种下去的棉籽，有不少出不了苗，有的出苗后就干死了。最早插上秧的水田里，仅剩下浅浅的一层水。塘里的水也快见底了。徐家闸长港中的水已断流。白石山水库也没有装到水。不少农民怀着焦急的心情，一天到田里看几遍。立夏过去了还是没有雨，农民的思想开始混乱，有人失去了信心。
    这时浠水县的领导机关发布了关于抗旱的紧急指示，县、区干部来到白石乡帮助抗旱。他们给农民带来了希望。中共白石乡支部开了几次紧急会议，研究了上级的指示，分析了本乡群众的思想情况，总结了历年来农民抗旱的经验，提出了加强管理水利机构，合理、节约用水，寻找水源，准备旱粮种籽等具体的抗旱办法。支部号召党员在抗旱中要起带头作用。全乡十四个党员在支部领导下分工领导着七个互助组网，以自己的实际行动，领导农民展开了抗旱斗争。
    党员詹全去年冬天在浠水县的劳动模范会上，听过汪岗区劳动模范介绍“掇秧”（寄苗移苗）的办法，这一次，他就带头在互助组内把一亩有水的田插了密密的秧苗，准备下了大雨之后，再移插到其他田里去。党员詹成右和王洪村在徐家闸已经干了的长港里，掏了两个大沙塘，塘里就浸出水来。他们找到了水源。王洪村掏的一口沙塘，可以救十亩田的秧苗。党员汪坤志领导他的互助组员讨论了种旱粮的计划，他把准备做粑吃的七升高粱拿出来做种籽，又买了七斤红薯秧子。在支部书记汪友炳的具体帮助下，鱼塘阁的水塘管理得很好，至今没有一点水浪费，也没有发生水利纠纷。管理这个水塘的经验，很快被附近五个管理水塘的负责人所接受。他们把五口水塘也管理得很好。全乡各村又分别开了许多老农座谈会，许多宝贵的抗旱经验被发掘出来，总结起来，推广开去。这样就增加了全乡农民的抗旱信心。
    五月十日夜晚落了一寸深的小雨。党支部号召全乡农民抓紧时机，突击插秧。这时水塘都开放了，数不清的水车在塘边、港内不停地转动，白花花的水灌进了新翻过的秧田中。插秧面积一天天增加，四天功夫，全乡从原来只有百分之五的插秧面积扩大到百分之八十六。
