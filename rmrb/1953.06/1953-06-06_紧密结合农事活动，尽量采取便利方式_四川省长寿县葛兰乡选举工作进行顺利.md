Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 5th: The Election Committee of Gelan Township, Changshou County, Sichuan Province, is closely integrating with current rural agricultural activities to carry out the general election work.

The general election work in Gelan Township began in early May. At that time, the whole township was busy transplanting rice seedlings, and the farmers had many concerns about carrying out the general election work. The township election committee studied this situation and held thorough discussions among the working cadres, formulating a plan for the general election work to be carried out in conjunction with agricultural activities, requiring the working cadres to do a good job in both leading production and the general election work.

When the work team cadres went deep into the residential groups, they discovered that many of the farmers' production problems needed to be solved. Because the promotion of sparse seedling transplantation was underway this year, there was a widespread shortage of seedlings among farmers; some farmers also lacked labor or draught cattle, and the seedlings could not be planted. The work cadres specifically helped the farmers solve these problems. After discussion at the grassroots cadre meeting, regarding the problem of seedling shortage, it was decided to educate the farmers not to use excess seedlings to feed cattle, to cherish the seedlings, and to redistribute surplus seedlings, which ensured that the paddy fields throughout the township universally adopted sparse seedling transplantation. The work team also adopted the method of allocating manpower, so that some farmers in the ninth residential group who lacked labor were able to transplant their seedlings in time. In this way, the masses were very satisfied, and affection was established between the working cadres and the masses.

After the general election propaganda campaign began, the township election committee paid close attention to the dispersed nature of the countryside and took into account the busy farming season. The grassroots cadres and propagandists in each village made full use of production gaps and evening time to carry out propaganda activities. They also adopted methods such as courtyard meetings and residents' group meetings to succinctly publicize the significance of the general election, so that 80 percent of the residents received general election education.

In order to take care of the masses' production, the township election committee did its best to adopt methods that facilitated mass production when conducting population surveys, voter registration, reviewing voter qualifications, and issuing voter certificates. For example, during the population survey, the method of delivering registration services to homes and fields was adopted, while simultaneously conducting door-to-door propaganda. At the group meetings to review voter qualifications and receive voter certificates, many people attended and their enthusiasm was high. The cadres and propagandists used this opportunity to conduct propaganda among the masses. In this way, even women and elderly people who rarely attended meetings on weekdays were educated and understood the principles of the general election. Subsequently, the township election committee also sampled the degree to which women had received education, and some electoral districts held women's group meetings or women's congresses, specifically publicizing to them the equality and universality of electoral rights stipulated by the electoral law. After extensive publicity, the whole township has reached a point where everyone knows about it. The ideological consciousness of the masses has generally improved, and voters in each electoral district are actively participating in electoral activities.

    紧密结合农事活动，尽量采取便利方式
    四川省长寿县葛兰乡选举工作进行顺利
    【新华社成都五日电】四川省长寿县葛兰乡选举委员会紧密结合农村当前的农事活动，进行普选工作。
    葛兰乡普选工作是在五月初开始的。当时，全乡正在插秧，农民对进行普选工作有很多顾虑。乡选举委员会研究了这种情况，并在工作干部中进行充分讨论，制订了与农事活动结合进行的普选工作计划，要求工作干部把领导生产和普选工作都作好。
    工作组干部深入各居民组时，发现农民生产上的许多问题需要解决。由于今年推广少秧密植，缺秧的农户很普遍；有的农民还缺乏劳动力或耕牛，秧子栽不上。工作干部便具体帮助农民解决这些问题。经过基层干部会议的讨论，对于缺秧问题，决定教育农民不用多余的秧子喂牛，爱惜秧子，调剂多余秧苗，结果保证了全乡的水田普遍作到少秧密植。工作组又采取调配人力的办法，使第九居民组部分缺乏劳动力的农民及时插上了秧。这样，群众非常满意，工作干部和群众之间也建立了感情。
    在普选宣传活动开始后，乡选举委员会很注意农村分散的特点，并照顾农忙季节。各村基层干部和宣传员多利用生产空隙和晚上的时间，进行宣传活动。并采取院子会、居民小组会等方式，扼要地宣传普选的意义，使百分之八十的居民受到普选的教育。
    乡选举委员会为照顾群众生产，在进行人口调查、选民登记、审查选民资格、发选民证等各项工作时，都尽量采取便利群众生产的方式。例如在人口调查时，采取送上门、送到田间登记的办法，同时结合进行挨户宣传。审查选民资格和领取选民证的小组会上，群众到会的人多，情绪也高。干部和宣传员就利用这个机会，对群众进行宣传。这样，连平日少开会的妇女和老年人也受到了教育，明白了普选的道理。接着，乡选举委员会又抽查了妇女接受教育的程度，有的选区并召开妇女小组会或妇女大会，特别对她们宣传选举法所规定的选举权的平等性和普遍性。经过广泛的宣传，全乡已经达到家喻户晓。群众思想觉悟普遍提高，各选区选民都积极参加选举活动。
