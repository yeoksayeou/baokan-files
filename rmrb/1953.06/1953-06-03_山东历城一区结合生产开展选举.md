(Reported by the *Dazhong Daily*, Shandong) The primary-level election work in thirteen townships of the First District of Licheng County, Shandong Province, is being actively and systematically carried out in conjunction with production work.

After arriving in each township on May 5th, the election work cadres immediately assisted the township government committees in summarizing the production work of the previous stage. The township government committees reported the production summary at the township people's representative meetings and adopted resolutions on the production tasks and election work for the next stage. At these meetings, the township election committee chairpersons designated by the county, together with various organizations and people's groups in the townships, consulted to nominate people who were upright, fair, connected to the masses, and had a certain ability to work as members of the township election committees. The township election committees were then established with the approval of the county election committee.

In order to closely integrate primary-level election work with production and to advance steadily under leadership, the entire district focused on Shahe, Peijiaying, and Liangwang townships as focal points, drawing on their experiences to promote work in the other ten townships. In their election propaganda, these townships combined explanations of the democratic management and mutually beneficial policies of mutual aid teams. This not only raised the political consciousness of the masses and mobilized them to actively participate in election work, but also further consolidated and developed the mutual aid teams. Registration and review personnel, in addition to participating in propaganda, also conducted regional surveys to understand the population situation, preparing for population surveys and voter registration. Some townships also re-divided electoral districts according to their local conditions, established people's opinion boxes, and collected people's opinions.

When conducting election work propaganda, the townships generally adopted a method of gradual expansion, from within the Party to outside the Party, and from cadres to the masses, constantly collecting mass feedback, carrying out propaganda targeted at the masses' thinking, and paying attention to enriching the content and improving the methods of propaganda. In its propaganda, Shahe Township conducted democratic education by comparing the new and old societies and the changes in the township's political situation, using facts familiar to the masses of the township. For example, when the township built an irrigation ditch last year, due to the bureaucratic style of the cadres, the irrigation ditch, once built, could not be used to channel water, causing great losses to the masses. This year, democracy was promoted when digging the irrigation ditch, which occupied less land but irrigated more fields, making the masses very satisfied. Because familiar facts were used to carry out democratic education, the masses' thinking of being masters of their own affairs was fully inspired. After receiving election education, the broad masses unanimously reflected that the election was good, saying: Selecting good cadres is like electing a good head of the household; with a good head of the household, there will be nothing but good days. After the masses' demand for democracy increased, they actively put forward criticisms and suggestions to the township leadership. In the past half month, Tantou Township received twelve items, Sujia Township received fifteen items, and Shahe Township received thirty-three items.

With the help of leading cadres and work team comrades, the township cadres have also further recognized the great significance of the general election and have expressed their desire to improve themselves, strive to be elected, and continue to serve the people. Zhao Xintian, chairman of the Liangwang Township Farmers' Association, actively led the masses in implementing the resolutions of the Township People's Representative Meeting, repairing roads and schools, and seriously handling people's letters. Li Shengqi, a member of the Shahe Township government committee, reviewed the mistakes in his work in the mutual aid team, expressing his desire to better serve the people. Due to the change in the work style of the broad masses of township cadres, and in accordance with the demands of the masses, the democratic life in the mutual aid and cooperation organizations has been greatly improved by leading production mutual aid and promptly handling people's letters. For example, in Shahe Township's sixty-eight mutual aid and cooperative organizations, seventeen township government committee members, mutual aid and cooperation representatives, and thirty-three mutual aid team leaders reviewed their past undemocratic work styles within their teams, and carried out work clearing and accounting and formulated wheat harvest plans on the basis of promoting democracy.

    山东历城一区结合生产开展选举
    【本报讯】据山东大众日报讯：山东省历城县第一区十三个乡的基层选举工作正积极地有领导地结合生产工作进行。
    普选工作干部于五月五日分别到达各乡后，即协助所在乡的乡政府委员会总结了前一阶段的生产工作。乡政府委员会在乡人民代表会议上报告了生产总结，并通过今后一个阶段的生产任务与普选工作决议。在这次会上，由县指派的乡选举委员会主席与所在乡的各种组织、人民团体酝酿提出为人正派、办事公道、联系群众、有一定工作能力的人做乡选举委员会的委员，并经县选举委员会批准成立了乡选举委员会。
    为使基层普选工作紧密结合生产，有领导地稳步前进，全区以沙河、裴家营、梁王三个乡为基点，吸取经验及时推动其他十个乡。这几个乡在普选宣传中，结合讲解了互助组的民主管理与互利政策，这就不仅提高了群众的政治觉悟，发动了群众积极参加普选工作，并进一步巩固与发展了互助组。登记审查的人员除了参加宣传外，同时按地区分工了解人口情况，给人口调查与选民登记作好准备。有的乡并根据本乡情况重新划分选区，建立人民意见箱，搜集人民意见。
    各乡在进行普选工作宣传时，一般都采取由党内到党外，由干部到群众逐步扩大的方式，随时搜集群众反映，针对群众思想进行宣传，并注意丰富宣传内容，改进宣传方法。沙河乡在宣传时，通过新旧社会的对比及该乡政治情况的变化，运用本乡群众熟悉的事实进行民主教育。如该乡去年修灌溉沟时，因干部有官僚主义作风，灌溉沟修好了不能通水，使群众受到很大损失。今年挖灌溉沟时发扬了民主，灌溉沟占地少浇地多，群众很满意。由于运用了群众熟悉的事实进行了民主教育，充分启发了群众当家作主的思想。广大群众在接受普选教育后，一致反映普选好，都说：选了好干部就如推选了好的当家人，有了好的当家人，没有不过好日子的。群众的民主要求提高后，积极向乡领导方面提出批评和建议，半月来滩头乡收到十二件，苏家乡收到十五件，沙河乡收到三十三件。
    经过领导干部与工作队同志的帮助，乡干部也进一步认识了普选的重大意义，纷纷表示要提高自己，争取当选，好继续为人民服务。梁王乡农民协会主席赵新田积极领导群众执行乡人民代表会议决议，修补了道路、学校，并认真处理了人民来信。沙河乡乡政府委员李盛起在互助组中检讨了自己工作中的错误，表示要更好地为人民服务。由于广大乡干部作风转变，并根据群众要求，领导好生产互助和及时处理人民来信，使互助合作组织中的民主生活大大提高。如沙河乡六十八个互助合作组织中，有十七个乡政府委员、互助合作代表、三十三个互助组长在组内对自己过去不民主的作风作了检讨，并在发扬民主的基础上进行了清工算账及制定了麦收计划。
