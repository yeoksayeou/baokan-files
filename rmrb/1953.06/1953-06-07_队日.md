    Team Day
    Yǔzǐ
    On the afternoon of May 14th, the weather was clear and bright. On the green lawn of the Wuchang Experimental Primary School campus, more than two hundred children wearing red scarves gathered. The breeze carried the children's laughter and the fragrance of flowers, filling the entire lawn with youthful joy. Everyone was excitedly looking forward to spending this meaningful day—Children's Team Day.

    Team Day began. A burst of warm and joyful applause greeted Teacher He as she walked into the venue.

    "Children, today is our Team Day. Let me first tell you a heroic combat story of a Volunteer Army uncle!" As soon as they heard that it was a combat story of a Volunteer Army uncle, the children's faces showed serious expressions, and their eyes stared straight at Teacher He, afraid of missing a word.

    "...Seeing the Volunteer Army uncles rushing up, victory was in sight. Unexpectedly, a central enemy fire point was discovered near the top of the mountain. Six machine guns firing a sheet of red light blocked the Volunteer Army uncles' path. The battalion chief of staff sent demolition men to blow it up several times, but they were either sacrificed or injured. At this time, there were only forty minutes before dawn, and we had to take this position before dawn. This was an order from the higher-ups." When Teacher He said this, the children's faces showed anxious expressions. Some children couldn't help but ask, "Then what did the uncles do, Teacher?"

    Teacher He looked at the children's nervous and anxious expressions and continued, "At this moment, the young uncle Huang Jiguang stepped forward. He handed the battalion chief of staff a letter of determination to participate in the battle, asking to take on the demolition mission. Immediately, he took two other uncles and rushed up as if flying..." When they heard that the two uncles who rushed up with Huang Jiguang had fallen, and he himself was seriously injured, passing out several times, a faint sound of sobbing could be heard on the lawn, and many small hands were secretly rubbing their wet eyes.

    "Uncle Huang Jiguang woke up again from his coma," Teacher He's words brought new hope to the children, "He struggled to throw the grenade, the grenade exploded, and four enemy machine guns became mute in the roar, but he passed out again. When he woke up again, it was almost dawn, and the enemy's two machine guns were still firing madly. He remembered that he was a member of the Youth League, thought of Chairman Mao's education, his mother's instructions in her letter, and the happy lives of the children of the motherland... He suddenly jumped up, pounced forward, and used his own body to block the machine gun eye that was spewing flames..." Teacher He paused, and at this moment, some children were crying loudly, and some were constantly wiping away the tears that were surging out.

    Teacher He said at the end of the story, "Then, our counterattack troops successfully rushed up and quickly occupied the enemy's position, annihilating more than 1,200 enemies." The victory of the battle seemed to be the greatest comfort to the children, and the crying stopped.

    "Children," Teacher He said finally, "Uncle Huang Jiguang sacrificed himself, he exchanged his life for the victory of the battle. His spirit will never die, he is our best example, we must wipe away our tears, we must turn our grief into strength, and commemorate Uncle Huang Jiguang with more efforts in our studies."

    The lawn was silent. The children were all seriously considering Teacher He's last sentence. Then they turned to the discussion of "What do I want to be when I grow up."

    "I want to be a people's navy when I grow up." Leng Chengquan broke the silence first. "American devils are invading us, they want to come from the sea. If I join the navy, I will block them, so that our motherland can build with peace of mind. Besides, standing on the bow of the ship, I can see the sunrise in the east, and the motherland and Chairman Mao in the west. I can also take a boat to Korea to see the place where Uncle Huang Jiguang sacrificed himself..." Yu Changhui said, "I want to be a good tractor driver when I grow up. If you can drive a tractor, it's easy to learn to drive a tank. Usually, I can produce well in the beautiful fields of the motherland; when someone invades us, I will drive a tank to eliminate them, like Uncle Huang Jiguang, there can be me but not the enemy." Speaking of this, she paused and added confidently, "I am sure I can learn to drive a tractor, because my father is a car driver!" "As for me, I want to be a good obstetrician and go to the countryside to deliver babies." The thirteen-year-old girl Luo Lian'ai just said this, which caused a burst of laughter. She blushed a little and continued, "Do you know, although the infant mortality rate in rural areas is much smaller than before liberation, not even one infant should be allowed to die. When I grow up, I will definitely go to the countryside, take the fighting spirit of Uncle Huang Jiguang, and fight against the phenomenon of infant mortality in rural areas, so that the excellent children of the Chinese people can be born safely one by one, and let them grow up to build and defend the motherland."

    The discussion continued. Every child wanted to take this opportunity to talk about their lofty ideals, and indeed they all had various lofty ideals needed by the motherland. Some said they wanted to be electrical workers and turn the dark nights of the countryside into daylight; some said they wanted to be outstanding construction engineers and erect thousands of buildings in the vast fields of the motherland; some said they wanted to be painters and paint all the heroic deeds of Uncle Huang Jiguang with their own hands... Finally, the fourteen-year-old child Wang Zhonghui expressed his determination and said, "I want to be a famous poet and write the combat story of Uncle Huang Jiguang into poems, so that Uncle Huang Jiguang will always live in my poems and in our hearts."

    "What more concrete actions can we take to commemorate Uncle Huang Jiguang?" This timely proposal immediately turned into a heated discussion. Finally, they passed a resolution:

    "We will use the elimination of thirds and striving for all fives in our academic performance as the beginning of the realization of our lofty ideals, to commemorate Uncle Huang Jiguang. The squadron that meets this requirement will be named after the heroic name of Uncle Huang Jiguang!"

    队日
    羽子
    五月十四日下午，天气晴朗。在武昌实验小学校园的绿色草坪上，聚拢了二百多个围着红领巾的孩子，微风夹着孩子们的笑语送来阵阵的花香，整个草坪充满着青春欢乐的气息。大家都在兴奋地期待着度过这个有意义的日子——少年儿童队的队日。
    队日开始了。一阵热烈愉快的掌声，何老师走进了会场。
    “小朋友们，今天是我们的队日。让我先给大家讲一个志愿军叔叔的英勇战斗故事吧！”一听说是讲志愿军叔叔的战斗故事，孩子们的脸上都露出了严肃的神情，眼睛直盯着何老师，生怕听漏掉一句话。
    “……眼看着志愿军叔叔们冲了上去，就要胜利了，想不到在山顶附近发现了敌人的一个中心火力点，六挺机枪发射的一片红光挡住了志愿军叔叔的进路。营参谋长接连几次派爆破手去爆破，但他们都牺牲的牺牲受伤的受伤了。这时离天亮只有四十分钟，而在天亮前我们必须拿下这个阵地，这是上级的命令。”何老师说到这里，孩子们的脸上都露出了焦急的神情。有的孩子就忍不住发问：“那叔叔们怎么办呢，老师？”
    何老师看了看孩子们紧张的焦急的表情，继续说道：“就在这时候，年轻的叔叔黄继光走出来了，他递给营参谋长一份参战决心书，要求去担任爆破任务。马上他就带着另外两个叔叔像飞也似地冲了上去……”。当他们听到和黄继光叔叔一块冲上去的两个叔叔都倒了下去，而他自己也受了重伤，几次昏迷过去的时候，草坪上可以听得到隐约的抽搐声，许多双小手在偷偷地揉擦着湿润了的眼睛。
    “黄继光叔叔又从昏迷中苏醒过来，”何老师的这句话给孩子重新带来了希望，“他吃力地把手雷扔过去，手雷爆炸了，敌人的四挺机枪在轰响中变成了哑巴，可是他又昏迷过去。再一次醒过来时，天快亮了，敌人的两挺机枪还在疯狂地扫射。他想起自己是个青年团员，想到毛主席对自己的教养，想到母亲来信的嘱咐，想到祖国孩子们的幸福生活……。他突然跳起来，猛扑过去，用自己的肉体堵住了正在喷吐着火焰的机关枪眼……。”何老师顿住了，这时有的孩子在放声哭泣，有的孩子在不停地擦着一阵阵涌出来的眼泪。
    何老师在故事的结尾说：“接着，我们的反击部队就顺利地冲了上去，很快占领了敌人的阵地，歼灭了敌人一千二百多名。”战斗的胜利好像是给孩子们的最大安慰一样，哭声停止了。
    “小朋友们，”何老师最后说：“黄继光叔叔牺牲了，他用自己的生命换得了战斗的胜利。他的精神永远不死，他是我们的最好榜样，我们要擦干眼泪，我们要把悲痛变成力量，用更加努力学习的实际行动来纪念黄继光叔叔。”
    草坪上呈现出一片寂静。孩子们都在严肃地考虑着何老师的最后一句话。接着就转入“我长大了做什么”的讨论。
    “我长大了要做一个人民海军。”冷成权第一个打破了沉默。“美国鬼子侵略我们，要打从海上来，我参加了海军，就要挡住它，让我们的祖国安心地建设。再说，我站在船头上，向东可以看见日出，向西可以看见祖国，看见毛主席。还可以坐着船到朝鲜去看看黄继光叔叔牺牲的地方呀……。”余长慧说：“我长大了要做一个好的拖拉机手。会开拖拉机，学开坦克也容易。平时，我可以在祖国美丽的田野上好好生产；谁要侵略咱们的时候，我就驾起坦克去消灭它，像黄继光叔叔一样，有我就不能有敌人。”说到这里，她停顿了一下，又很有信心地补充了一句：“学开拖拉机准有把握，因为我父亲是一个汽车司机呀！”“我呢，我要做一个好的产科医生，到农村去接生。”十三岁的女孩子罗莲爱刚说了这么一句，就引起了一阵笑声。她红了一下脸，继续说：“你们知道吗，农村里婴儿的死亡率虽然比解放前小得多了，可是一个婴儿也不应该叫他死去呀。我长大了，一定到农村去，拿黄继光叔叔的战斗精神，和农村婴儿死亡的现象作斗争，要使得中国人民的优秀儿女一个个都平安的诞生，让他们长大了建设祖国和保卫祖国。”
    讨论会在继续着。每一个孩子都想藉这个机会谈谈自己的远大理想，而且的确他们都有各种各样的祖国所需要的远大理想。有的说他要做一个电气工人，把农村的黑夜都变成白昼；有的说他要做一个出色的建筑工程师，在广大祖国的原野上，树立起成千上万幢的楼房；有的说他要做一个画家，用自己的手把黄继光叔叔的英雄事迹全部画下来……。最后，十四岁的小朋友王中惠表示自己的决心说：“我要做一个著名的诗人，把黄继光叔叔的战斗故事写成诗篇，让黄继光叔叔永远活在我的诗里，活在我们的心上。”
    “我们用什么更具体的行动来纪念黄继光叔叔呢？”这个适时的提议立即又变成了热烈的讨论。最后，他们通过了一项决议：
    “要用消灭三分，争取全部五分的学习成绩来做为自己远大理想实现的开端，来纪念黄继光叔叔。那一个中队达到这个要求，就用黄继光叔叔的英雄名字来命名！”
