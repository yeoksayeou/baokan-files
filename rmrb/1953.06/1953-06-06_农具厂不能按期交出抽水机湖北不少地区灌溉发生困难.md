    The Agricultural Implement Factory Fails to Deliver Water Pumps on Schedule, Causing Irrigation Difficulties in Many Areas of Hubei
    Yu Shutang of the Construction Section of the Huangmei County People's Government in Hubei Province writes: The Huanggang Prefectural Water Conservancy Bureau of Hubei Province sent people to Huangmei County last year to establish a water pump station. This March, they entrusted the County Water Conservancy Bureau and farmers to sign contracts for using water pumps for irrigation, stipulating that ten water pumps would be delivered to three townships before the end of April, irrigating 4,000 mu of land. But until now (May 10th), eight water pumps are still missing; the two water pumps that have arrived also frequently break down, and only 200 mu of land have been irrigated in four or five days. Now is the crucial time to rush transplanting rice seedlings, and the farmers' fields still have no water. They originally thought they would have water pumps, so they abandoned the ditches. In many places, it is now impossible to draw water with waterwheels; some farmers also didn't apply for waterwheel loans because they signed contracts to use water pumps. Farmers are worried about production losses, so anxious they want to cry, and they are constantly complaining. This is a problem concerning the lives of a vast number of people, and it cannot be ignored at all.
    Editor's Note: The situation reflected in the reader Yu Shutang's letter, according to our understanding, exists in many places in Hubei Province. In January of this year, the Hubei Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau signed contracts with the Nanchang Agricultural Implement Factory in Jiangxi Province, the Jiujiang Agricultural Implement Factory, the Hengyang Machinery Factory in Hunan Province, the Changsha Antimony Products Machinery Factory, the Kaifeng Agricultural Implement Factory in Henan Province, and the Hubei Agricultural Implement Factory to purchase water pumps; but so far, except for the Kaifeng Agricultural Implement Factory and the Hengyang Machinery Factory that can deliver goods, the remaining factories have not been able to deliver the water pumps that were stipulated to be delivered before the end of March by mid-May. This has seriously affected land irrigation in many areas of Hubei Province. We believe that the above-mentioned agricultural implement factories should quickly improve production and step up the manufacturing of water pumps ordered by the Hubei Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau; and before the water pumps are produced, the people's governments at all levels in Hubei Province should lead local farmers to take urgent and effective measures to solve the irrigation problem.

### 农具厂不能按期交出抽水机湖北不少地区灌溉发生困难

专栏：读者来信摘要

    农具厂不能按期交出抽水机湖北不少地区灌溉发生困难
    湖北省黄梅县人民政府建设科余树唐来信：湖北省黄冈专署水利分局去年派人来黄梅县建立了抽水机站。今年三月间，他们委托县水利局和农民订立使用抽水机抽水的合同，规定在四月底以前三个乡可运来十部抽水机，灌田四千亩。但到现在（五月十日），抽水机还有八部没有下落；已来的两部抽水机也经常发生故障，四、五天还没灌上两百亩田。现在正是抢插秧的关头，农民们田里还没水。他们原来认为将有抽水机了，就把水沟都废了。好多地方现在用水车也车不上水来；还有些农民因为订了使用抽水机抽水合同，水车贷款没有要。农民们眼看生产受损失，急得要哭，埋怨不止。这是一个广大群众生活的问题，完全不能忽视。
    编者按：读者余树唐来信所反映的情况，据我们了解，在湖北省不少地方都有。今年一月，湖北省水利局分别和江西省南昌农具厂、九江市农具厂、湖南省衡阳市机械厂、长沙市锑品机械厂、河南省开封农具厂、湖北省农具厂签订购置抽水机合同；但至今除开封农具厂、衡阳市机械厂可交货外，其余各厂到五月中旬还不能交出合同规定在三月底以前应交的抽水机。这就使湖北省不少地区土地灌溉受到严重影响。我们认为：上述各农具厂应该迅速改进生产，加紧制造湖北省水利局订制的抽水机；而在抽水机制出以前，湖北省各级人民政府应该领导当地农民采取紧急有效的办法解决灌溉问题。
