Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, June 27: Moscow newspapers on the 27th published reports from Xinhua's special correspondent in Kaesong exposing Syngman Rhee's criminal actions, encouraged by the United States, to undermine the Korean armistice, as well as excerpts from the People's Daily editorial "Striving to Persist in a Peaceful Resolution of the Korean Question." The "Literary Gazette" published an editorial on the 27th entitled "How Syngman Rhee's Provocative Actions Were Prepared." The editorial stated: There is no need to mention here the painful details of the Koje Island incident—the whole world will remember them. Now, as Syngman Rhee "releases" tens of thousands of Korean prisoners of war from the POW camps and forcibly drives them into his own army, it is worth recalling that the actions of the US government and the Syngman Rhee clique on Koje Island were aimed at preventing captured Korean People's Army and Chinese People's Volunteer soldiers from returning to their homeland, forcibly detaining them in South Korea, and using them to replenish the armies of Syngman Rhee and Chiang Kai-shek. The editorial then listed various facts since last year, proving the conspiracy between the US government and Syngman Rhee. Finally, the editorial cited news and facts from all parties since the 18th, proving that the United States is the supporter of Syngman Rhee's provocative actions.

    苏联“文学报”斥责李承晚的挑衅行动
    【新华社莫斯科二十七日电】莫斯科各报二十七日登载了新华社开城特派记者揭发李承晚在美国纵容下破坏朝鲜停战的罪恶活动的报道和人民日报社论“为坚持和平解决朝鲜问题而奋斗”的摘要。 “文学报”二十七日发表了以“李承晚挑衅行动是怎样准备的”为题的社论。社论说：这里不必提起巨济岛事件的惨痛细节——全世界将记住它们。现在当李承晚从战俘营中“释放”几万朝鲜战俘，并用暴力把他们赶到自己军队中去的时候，可以回想起，美国政府和李承晚分子在巨济岛的行为，就是要阻碍被俘的朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军战士回到祖国，强力扣留他们在南朝鲜，并且用他们来补充李承晚和蒋介石的军队。社论接着列举了去年以来的种种事实，证明美国政府和李承晚的阴谋。社论最后引证十八日以来的各方消息和事实，证明美国是李承晚挑衅行动的支持者。
