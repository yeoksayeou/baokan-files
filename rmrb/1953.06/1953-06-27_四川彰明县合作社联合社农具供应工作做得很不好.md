    The Agricultural Implement Supply Work of the Zhangming County Cooperative Union in Sichuan Province is Very Poor
    Pu Yincheng and Mei Guizhen from the Second District of Zhangming County, Sichuan Province, wrote: The agricultural implement supply work of the Zhangming County Cooperative Union is very poor. Not only is the supply of agricultural implements not timely, but they are only loaned to farmers after the busy farming season is over. Furthermore, the quality is low, and the price is much more expensive than in the market. For example, the harrow purchased by the Liu Guangcai mutual aid group from the cooperative cost 23,000 yuan. The wooden frame was poorly made, and the wooden teeth were broken. It was also received late. Others bought better quality harrows in the market for 14,000 yuan, and they were available right when they were needed. In addition, the cooperative's bamboo baskets cannot hold rapeseed, and the bamboo mats are not suitable for threshing rapeseed. Farmers are very dissatisfied after buying them. We hope that the Zhangming County Cooperative Union will immediately correct this situation and earnestly improve the agricultural implement supply work.

### 四川彰明县合作社联合社农具供应工作做得很不好

    四川彰明县合作社联合社农具供应工作做得很不好
    四川省彰明县二区蒲银成、梅桂珍来信：彰明县合作社联合社农具供应工作做得很不好。该社的农具不但供应得不及时，在农忙期过后才贷到农民手里，而且质量低，价钱比市场上的贵好多。如刘光才互助组向合作社买的?耙，价钱是二万三千元，木架做得不好，木齿都破了。拿到的时间又晚。别人在市上用一万四千元买的?耙质量却比合作社的好，又正用在季节上。此外，合作社的箩儿装不得菜籽，晒席打不得菜籽；农民买后都很不满意。我们希望彰明县合作社联合社立即纠正这种情况，认真改进农具供应工作。
