Xinhua News Agency, June 18th: Amidst the massive worldwide wave to save the Rosenbergs, U.S. Supreme Court Justice Douglas ruled to stay the execution of the Rosenbergs, and pointed out that the death sentence for the Rosenbergs was improper. However, U.S. judicial authorities are still actively arranging to murder the Rosenbergs.

In a ruling statement issued on the 17th in response to the application of two lawyers, Judge Douglas said that he had "serious doubts about the Rosenbergs' death sentence" and that "the Rosenbergs should be given a chance to appeal."

The U.S. Supreme Court has adjourned. According to U.S. judicial procedure, during the recess, if any judge of the Supreme Court has a different opinion on the judgment of a case appealed to the Supreme Court, he can rule for a stay of execution, and the original court will review it.

Even so, the American reactionaries have not given up their plan to murder the Rosenbergs. Immediately after Douglas's ruling was announced, Attorney General Brownell asked Chief Justice Vinson of the Supreme Court to convene a special court to review Judge Douglas's ruling. Vinson immediately notified that a special court would be convened at noon on the 18th in order to veto Douglas's ruling by a majority. Therefore, the lives of the Rosenbergs are still in danger. U.S. judicial authorities had previously announced that the Rosenbergs would be electrocuted on the evening of the 18th.

At the same time, the movement to save the Rosenbergs in various countries continues to expand. The French Committee to Save the Rosenbergs sent a telegram to Eisenhower on the 17th, requesting the cancellation of the Rosenbergs' death sentence. The British National Committee to Defend the Rosenbergs held a mass rally in Hyde Park. After the meeting, a delegation was sent to the U.S. Embassy to present a resolution passed at the meeting, requesting Eisenhower to cancel the Rosenbergs' death sentence. The Radical Civic Union of Argentina also sent a telegram to Eisenhower requesting the cancellation of the Rosenbergs' death sentence.

Xinhua News Agency, June 18th: TASS Warsaw, June 17th: It is reported that the Central Council of the Polish Red Cross has requested the government of the People's Republic of Poland, in accordance with Article 75 of the Constitution of the People's Republic of Poland, to allow the Rosenbergs, who have been sentenced to death by the U.S. government, to enter the country for asylum.

Based on humanitarian spirit, the government of the People's Republic of Poland has decided to accept the request of the Polish Red Cross and allow the Rosenbergs to seek asylum in Poland, should the U.S. government decide to let the Rosenbergs leave the United States.

In order to implement the above-mentioned decision of the Polish government, Polish Foreign Minister S. Skrzeszewski sent a note containing the above information to the U.S. Ambassador to Poland, Joseph Flack, on June 15th.

    美国最高法院法官道格拉斯
    裁决缓期执行罗森堡夫妇的死刑
    美国反动派仍积极布置谋杀罗森堡夫妇
    波兰政府愿意接受罗森堡夫妇到波兰避难
    【新华社十八日讯】在全世界各地声势浩大的拯救罗森堡夫妇的浪潮之下，美最高法院法官道格拉斯裁决缓期执行罗森堡夫妇的死刑，并指出对罗森堡夫妇的死刑判决不当，但美司法当局仍积极布置杀害罗森堡夫妇。
    道格拉斯法官十七日就两位律师的申请发表的裁决声明说，他对罗森堡夫妇的“死刑判决有重大的怀疑”，并说“应当给罗森堡夫妇以申诉的机会”。
    美国最高法院已休庭。根据美国司法程序，在休庭期中，最高法院任一法官对提到最高法院上诉的案件的判决具有不同意见，即可裁决缓刑，由原判法院予以重审。
    虽然如此，美国反动派还没有放弃杀害罗森堡夫妇的计划。在道格拉斯的裁决刚刚宣布后，司法部长布朗纳尔就要求最高法院首席法官文生召开一次特别庭，审查道格拉斯法官的裁决。文生随即通知在十八日午召开特别庭，以便以多数否决道格拉斯的裁决。因此，罗森堡夫妇的生命仍在危险中。美司法当局前已宣布要在十八日晚用电刑杀害罗森堡夫妇。
    与此同时，各国拯救罗森堡夫妇的运动继续扩大。法国拯救罗森堡夫妇委员会于十七日打电报给艾森豪威尔，要求取消罗森堡夫妇的死刑。英国保卫罗森堡全国委员会在海德公园举行了群众集会。会后派遣代表团向美国大使馆提出一项会上通过的决议，要求艾森豪威尔取消罗森堡夫妇死刑。阿根廷的激进公民联盟也打电报给艾森豪威尔要求取消罗森堡夫妇的死刑。
    【新华社十八日讯】塔斯社华沙十七日讯：据悉，波兰红十字会中央理事会已请求波兰人民共和国政府根据波兰人民共和国宪法第七十五条准许被美国政府判处死刑的罗森堡夫妇入境避难。
    波兰人民共和国政府基于人道主义的精神决定接受波兰红十字会的请求，准许罗森堡夫妇到波兰避难，假如美国政府决定让罗森堡夫妇离开美国的话。
    为履行波兰政府的上述决议，波兰外交部长斯·斯克热歇夫斯基已于六月十五日以以上内容的照会一份交给了美国驻波兰大使约瑟夫·弗拉克。
