Improving the Ideological and Artistic Level of Popular Readings
Zhang Liyun

The educational effect of popular readings on the broad masses of people is beyond doubt. As the cultural level of the vast working people continues to improve, popular readings have become, and will continue to be, an indispensable source of spiritual nourishment for them. Therefore, the editorial and publishing organs of popular readings bear a very important responsibility for educating the workers, peasants, and soldiers. To constantly provide popular publications with a high degree of ideological and artistic quality is the most glorious task of the editorial and publishing organs of popular readings and is also their most concrete manifestation of serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers.

In the past, many publishing organs have made great achievements in this regard. However, many editors and publishers of popular readings have not adequately fulfilled their glorious responsibilities. They not only often publish publications with empty content and low ideological and artistic levels, but also publish publications with ideological errors and poor quality. These publications have not only failed to provide the broad masses of people with beneficial education, but some have even seriously harmed their ideological health.

Recently, I read 197 popular readings related to military life sold in bookstores in Beijing. Among them, 54 were text-based books and 143 were comic books. These readings were published by 68 bookstores (56 of them in Shanghai). Among them, 9 were state-owned and 59 were privately owned. The total circulation of all the books was more than 3.6 million copies. "Jinggangshan" has been distributed 220,000 copies, and the comic book "Flowers of the Motherland" has been published in its eighth edition, and this was only the situation before the end of 1952.

It should be affirmed that a large part of these popular readings are good. They promote the fine traditions and the glorious qualities of revolutionary heroism of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, the inseparable connection between the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the people, and the justice of the Chinese People's Volunteers' struggle to resist US aggression and aid Korea, as well as their high degree of patriotism and internationalism, thus playing a certain role in propaganda and education among the people. But it is undeniable that many popular readings also have shortcomings and errors of varying degrees.

Among the few books depicting the Second Revolutionary Civil War, some have serious errors. For example, in "Autumn Harvest Uprising" (published by China Youth Publishing House, "Great Motherland" small series), the author stated dogmatically when talking about the purpose of the Autumn Harvest Uprising: "At that time, the Chinese Communist Party's purpose for the Autumn Harvest Uprising was: 1. The revolutionary Communist Party completely broke away from the counter-revolutionary Kuomintang to distinguish between the enemy and ourselves; 2. To organize the workers' and peasants' revolutionary army; 3. To confiscate the land and property of landlords and distribute them to poor peasants; 4. To overthrow the Kuomintang's counter-revolutionary regime and establish a revolutionary regime led by the Communist Party; 5. To organize the workers', peasants', and soldiers' representative conference regime." This statement is obviously not fully substantiated. When talking about the success or failure of the Autumn Harvest Uprising, the author only mentioned the failure side without pointing out the side where the uprising achieved certain results. This is inconsistent with Comrade Mao Zedong's evaluation of the Autumn Harvest Uprising (see "Strategic Issues of China's Revolutionary War") and Comrade Hu Qiaomu's statement on the success or failure of the Autumn Harvest Uprising in "Thirty Years of the Communist Party of China."

"Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu in the Red Army Era," published by Hunan Popular Reading Publishing House, does not match the title and content. The author only put forward some fragmentary trivial matters of life based on his own feelings. The content is empty and lacks greater educational significance. It is inappropriate to publish works of this kind of leader's deeds so casually.

The Beijing Minzhi Bookstore published "New Children's Stories," which contains a story called "The Red Army and the Lolo People." This story made inappropriate descriptions of fraternal ethnic groups, showing a tendency of Han chauvinism. "The Story of Little Iron Bull" and "Hero Little Good Man," which take the anti-Japanese struggle of the military and civilians in the liberated areas as the theme, completely inappropriately exaggerated the role of children in the anti-Japanese struggle. The plot of "The Story of Little Iron Bull" is completely fictional. For example, it wrote that a fourteen-year-old child, Little Iron Bull, stabbed a Japanese devil to death with one bayonet. It also wrote that he destroyed two Japanese tanks with hand grenades alone. "Hero Little Good Man" portrays a sixteen-year-old new soldier as an omnipotent figure. For example, it said that he threw hand grenades 35.2 meters, which "created a new record for the entire company"; for example, it said that when the troops were transferring their station, the "Youth Women's Team" (?) in the village also came to see them off, and they took two packs of needles and two skeins of thread, "must give it to him" (here, the author vulgarized the military-civilian relations of the anti-Japanese army). For example, it said that in the battle, he rushed to the invading enemy alone and threw forty hand grenades in succession, "killing dozens of devils" and "capturing more than thirty devils and two traitors alive." It even exaggerated and said: "The victory of this battle was thanks to Little Good Man's bravery"; "Having him in the team encouraged the fighting mood and created the conditions for victory." In addition, the book "Hero Little Good Man" also shows that the author lacks basic military and political knowledge. For example, it said: Little Good Man "has patriotic ideas of nationalism." In a battle, Little Good Man "stood on the front line to cover his comrades in the strategic general offensive," etc.

The comic book "Bloody Battle at Tianmen Peak" (published by Shanghai Guangyi Book Company) erroneously promoted the absurd idea of our army falsely surrendering to the enemy, which seriously slandered the image and qualities of the revolutionary army.

The "Worker, Peasant and Soldier Story Series" published by Shanghai Guangyi Book Company takes the heroic stories of the People's Liberation Army in the Liberation War as its theme. Most of these stories are based on the deeds of the heroes who attended the National Congress of Combat Heroes. The content of the "Sino-Korean People's Combat Hero Story Series" is mostly adapted from the reports on the Korean front published in newspapers and magazines. Therefore, these two series have a high degree of ideological quality. But they all have a common shortcoming, that is, they exaggerate the role of heroic figures too much. The authors often leave the leadership of the Party and superiors, and leave the power of the collective to write about heroes. Some places are exaggerated to the point of being unbelievable. For example, in the article "Sharp Knife Hero Zhang Honglin," the author said: "Zhang Honglin wiped out 12,000 enemies in one day and night." In the article "Shooting Hero Guan Chonggui," the author said that Guan Chonggui was "the number one combat hero in the country." The subtitle of the article "Hero Tank Driver Wang Fengchi" is "Recovering the position and annihilating more than 500 enemies," but this was the victory jointly achieved by our army's infantry and tank company in the battle, not Wang Fengchi's alone. The subtitle of "Anti-Tank Hero Pan Zemin" is "Destroying 20 enemy tanks in three hours," which made the same mistake as the above article, because in fact Pan Zemin only destroyed three. The statement in the article "Two Anti-Tank Gunners" about "destroying or damaging seven enemy tanks in thirty minutes" is also inconsistent with the facts. Secondly, the battle stories compiled in these two series are mostly conceptualized, and many details and facts are inconsistent, with many errors and omissions. Therefore, in terms of educational effect, it cannot be greatly reduced.

The cover of the book "Heroes on the Long River Bank" (published by Yinghua Publishing House) depicts two Chiang Kai-shek soldiers showing off their power to the common people, which is simply like touting for the enemy. The content of this book is also very bad. In order to show the scene of the revolutionary people sheltering a wounded revolutionary soldier, the author used extremely vulgar means to write about how a rural girl took off her clothes and got into the soldier's quilt, etc. This is not only the author's fabrication, but also a serious distortion of the revolutionary military-civilian relations. The picture of the book "Flames of Revenge" is extremely bad, depicting the Volunteer Army as being no different from the Li bandits' army.

The most important reason for these shortcomings and errors is that the authors lack the necessary military and political level and artistic cultivation. Therefore, they have made many jokes in both pictures and words. Some drew female comrades during the Anti-Japanese War as people wearing long skirts, some drew the platoon leader of the Volunteer Army as an officer wearing a coat and carrying a pistol, and some repeatedly talked about how soldiers made meritorious service during the Anti-Japanese War (the meritorious service movement was not launched at that time), etc. In fact, these are not in line with the facts, but only things that the author imagined out of thin air. Another reason is that some publishing organs or publishers lack a correct understanding of the educational role of popular readings. They either underestimate these things and fail to take a serious and serious attitude towards these publications; or they lose their sense of responsibility for educating the people for the sake of profit.

In order to improve this situation and enable popular readings to fulfill their glorious responsibility of educating the broad masses of workers, peasants and soldiers, the editorial and publishing organs of popular readings should adopt a more serious and conscientious attitude towards their publications, and oppose the bad practice of publishing works harmful to the people simply for profit. The authors of popular readings should work hard to study politics, correct their stand, and improve their skills, so that the ideological and artistic level of their works can be further improved.

At the same time, it is hoped that the propaganda departments and cultural departments of high-level political organs of the troops will regularly review the popular readings about the army published by public and private bookstores in the future. Recommend the good ones and criticize the bad ones; for those with major errors, suggestions should be made to their publishing organs and they should be asked to revise them before publishing. If the content of some publications involves major issues, and the original author or publisher requests the military organs to assist in the review before publication, it is hoped that the military organs will accept this request and help the author or publisher to improve the work. However, it must be recognized that improving the ideological and artistic level of popular readings is a long-term struggle process. Except for readings that are ideologically reactionary or extremely absurd in content, an active attitude should be adopted to promote their advantages and overcome their shortcomings. Any hasty denial or prohibition of publication is incorrect.

    提高通俗读物的思想水平和艺术水平
    张立云
    通俗读物对广大人民的教育作用，是没有人能够怀疑的。在广大劳动人民的文化水平日益提高的情况下，通俗读物已经成为并将继续成为广大人民不可一日或缺的精神食粮。因此，通俗读物的编辑出版机关，对于教育工农兵群众所负的责任是非常重大的。经常不断地供给具有高度思想性和艺术性的通俗出版物，是通俗读物的编辑出版机关最光荣的任务，也是他们为工农兵服务的最具体的表现。
    过去，许多出版机关在这方面曾有很大的成绩。但是，不少通俗读物的编辑出版者，还没有很好地尽到自己光荣的职责。他们不仅常常出版着内容空洞、思想艺术水平很低的出版物，而且也出版着思想错误、品质恶劣的出版物。这些出版物不仅未使广大人民得到有益的教育，而且，有的更严重地损害了他们思想的健康。
    最近，阅读了北京各书店出售的有关部队生活的通俗读物一百九十七册。其中文字读物五十四册，连环画一百四十三册。这些读物是由六十八家书店出版的（上海的书店即有五十六家）。其中公营的九家，私营的五十九家。全部书籍的发行额为三百六十余万册。“井岗山”一书已发行二十二万册，连环画“祖国之花”已出到八版，这还只是一九五二年年底以前的情况。
    应该肯定，这些通俗读物的很大一部分是好的。它们宣传了中国人民解放军的优良传统和革命英雄主义的光辉品质，宣传了中国人民解放军和人民群众的血肉不可分的联系，宣传了中国人民志愿军抗美援朝斗争的正义性和其高度的爱国主义与国际主义精神，因而在人民群众中起了一定的宣传教育作用。但是不可否认，许多通俗读物又都存在着不同程度的缺点和错误。
    在描写第二次国内革命战争的稀有的几本书中，有的就存在着严重的错误。如在“秋收起义”（青年出版社印行，“伟大的祖国”小丛书）这本书中，作者在讲到秋收起义的目的时，就武断地说：“当时，中国共产党对秋收起义的目的是这样的：一、革命的共产党与反革命的国民党完全脱离关系，分清敌我；二、组织工农革命军队；三、没收地主土地财产，分给贫苦农民；四、推翻国民党反革命政权，建立以共产党为领导的革命政权；五、组织工农兵代表会议政权。”这种说法显然是没有充分根据的。在说到秋收起义的成败时，作者也只是说到失败的一面，而没有指出起义取得一定成果的一面。这和毛泽东同志对秋收起义的估价（见“中国革命战争的战略问题”），以及胡乔木同志在“中国共产党的三十年”中对秋收起义的成败问题的提法，是不相符合的。
    湖南通俗读物出版社出版的“红军时代的毛主席和朱总司令”，标题和内容很不相称，作者仅凭自己所感，提了些片断的生活琐事，内容空虚，缺乏较大的教育意义。对于领袖事迹一类的作品，这样随便出版，是不适当的。
    北京民智书店发行的“新儿童故事”一书中，有一篇“红军和倮倮族”的故事。这篇故事对兄弟民族作了不恰当的描写，表现了大汉族主义的思想倾向。以解放区军民的抗日斗争为题材的“小铁牛的故事”和“英雄小好汉”，完全不适当地夸大了儿童在抗日斗争中的作用。“小铁牛的故事”的情节完全是虚构的。如写一个十四岁的孩子小铁牛，一刺刀就刺死一个日本鬼子。并写他一个人用手榴弹就炸毁了日寇两辆坦克。“英雄小好汉”则把一个十六岁的新战士描绘成无所不能的人物。如说他投手榴弹投了三十五公尺二，就“创造了全连的新纪录”；如说部队在转移驻地的时候，村中的“青年妇女队”（？）也来送行，她们拿了两包针和两绺线，“一定要送给他”（在这里，作者把抗日军队的军民关系庸俗化了）。如说在战斗中，他一个人向来犯的敌人冲去，先后扔出四十多颗手榴弹，就“炸死了几十个鬼子”，“活捉三十多个鬼子与两个汉奸”。甚至夸大说：“这次的作战胜利，多亏了小好汉的勇敢”；“队伍里有了他，就鼓舞起了战斗的情绪，创造了胜利的条件。”等等。此外，“英雄小好汉”一书还表现了作者缺乏起码的军事政治知识。如说：小好汉“富有民族主义的爱国思想”，在一次战斗中，小好汉“站在最前线，掩护同志们作战略上的总攻”等。
    连环画“血战天门顶”（上海广艺书局出版），错误地宣传了我军向敌人实行假投降的荒谬思想，极严重地污蔑了革命军队的形象和品质。
    上海广艺书局出版的“工农兵故事丛书”是以解放战争中人民解放军的英雄故事为题材的。这些故事大多取材于出席全国战斗英雄代表会议的英雄们的事迹。“中朝人民战斗英雄故事丛书”中的内容，多是参照报章杂志上刊载的朝鲜前线通讯改编的。因此，这两套丛书具有较高的思想性。但它们都存在着一个共同的缺点，就是过分夸大了英雄人物的作用。作者往往离开党和上级的领导，离开集体的力量去写英雄。有的地方则夸大得令人难以置信。如在“尖刀英雄张洪林”一文中，作者说：“张洪林一昼夜间歼敌一万二千人”。在“射击英雄关崇贵”一文中，作者说关崇贵是“全国第一名战斗英雄”。“英雄坦克手王凤池”一文的副标题是“夺回阵地歼灭敌人五百多”，其实这是我军步兵和坦克连在战斗中共同取得的胜利，并非王凤池一人之功。“反战车英雄潘泽民”的副标题是 “三小时击毁敌人战车二十辆”，和上文犯了同样的毛病，因为事实上潘泽民仅击毁了三辆。“两位反坦克射击手”一文中关于“三十分钟打毁打伤敌人七辆坦克”的说法，也是不合乎事实的。其次，这两套丛书所编写的战斗故事也多半是概念化的，许多细节和事实不符合，错漏甚多。所以，在教育作用上，不能不大为减色。
    “龙河岸上的英雄”（影华出版社出版）一书的封面上，画着两个向老百姓耀武扬威的蒋匪军，简直像是替敌人吹嘘。这本书的内容也很恶劣。作者为了表现革命人民掩护一个负伤的革命战士的场面，竟用极庸俗的手法，写一个农村姑娘如何脱光衣服，钻进战士的被窝等等。这不仅是作者的凭空虚构，而且是对革命的军民关系的严重歪曲。“复仇的火焰”一书画面极端恶劣，把志愿军画成了与李匪军一般无二。
    所以出现这些缺点和错误，最主要的原因，是作者缺乏必要的军事政治水平和艺术修养。因此，不论在画面上和文字上都闹了许多笑话。有的把抗日战争时期的女同志画成穿长裙子的人，有的把志愿军的班长画成穿大衣、挎手枪的官长，有的一再说到抗战时期的战士如何立功（当时未开展立功运动）等等。其实，这些都是不合乎事实，而仅是作者凭空想出来的东西。其次一个原因，是某些出版机关或出版商对于通俗读物的教育作用缺乏正确的认识。他们或者是由于轻视这些东西，而不去采取认真的严肃的态度对待这些出版物；或者是由于为了营利，而对教育人民失去了责任心。
    为了改善这种情况，使通俗读物尽到它教育广大工农兵群众的光荣职责，通俗读物的编辑出版机关应对其出版物采取更严肃认真的态度，反对单纯为了营利而出版有害人民的作品的恶劣作风。通俗读物的作者要努力学习政治，端正立场，提高技术，使自己的作品的思想水平与艺术水平进一步提高。
    同时，希望今后部队高级政治机关的宣传部门和文化部门，对公私书店出版的有关军队的通俗读物经常进行审查。推荐好的，批评坏的；对有较大错误的，应向其出版机关提出建议，请他们修正后再出版。如果有些出版物内容牵涉的问题较大，原作者或出版者请求军事机关在出版前协助审查时，希望军事机关接受这种请求，帮助作者或出版者把作品改得更完善些。但是，必须认识：提高通俗读物的思想水平和艺术水平，是一个长期的斗争过程，除非思想反动或内容极端荒谬的读物外，都应抱着发扬其优点，克服其缺点的积极态度。任何轻率否定或禁止出版的态度，都是不正确的。
