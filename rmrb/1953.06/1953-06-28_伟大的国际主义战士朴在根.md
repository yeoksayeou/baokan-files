　　The Great Internationalist Fighter Park Jae-geun
　　On November 3, 1952, as the Battle of Shangganling was raging fiercely, Park Jae-geun's stretcher team braved enemy fire and set off from Eryi Village, Rangok Township, Huaiyang County, toward Shangganling.

　　This was one of the stretcher teams spontaneously organized by Korean farmers near Shangganling to support the Chinese People's Volunteers. When Park Jae-geun formed this stretcher team with Kim Ji-gu, Choi Mu-yong, Lu Jun-gu, and others, he said to everyone, "I am an ordinary old man who doesn't know much about the world, but I do know one thing: we should dedicate everything to support the beloved Chinese People's Volunteers."

　　Before setting off, Park Jae-geun thought: Let's take something good to the Volunteer comrades! But after thinking it over, there was nothing good to give. His home was near the front lines, and everything had been bombed by American planes. Finally, he remembered that someone had said that the Volunteer soldiers lacked water to drink in the tunnels, so he wrapped a large bundle of radishes and carried it on the stretcher to the front. He said to his wife, Li Yuxian, "How wonderful it would be if these were apples and pears that the Volunteer comrades loved to eat!"

　　That evening, they arrived at the stretcher team liaison post.

　　The next day, Park Jae-geun's stretcher team set off for the forward medical station through cannon smoke and rain of bullets. Enemy shells and bombs often exploded not far away. Especially after approaching the mountain ridge near the front lines, the road was particularly difficult to travel. The ground was turned over, the rocks were shattered, and the trees were lying across the path. It was almost impossible to see where the road was; but these "soldiers without guns," in order to hurry and transport the wounded, advanced quickly over mountains and ridges, regardless of difficulties and dangers.

　　At this time, the brave warriors of the Chinese People's Volunteers were heroically striking the enemy. Many moving and inspiring heroes were constantly emerging at this time. This further ignited the internationalist feelings of Park Jae-geun and his stretcher team members, making him feel even more that he must spare no sacrifice to complete the task of transporting the wounded Volunteers.

　　The first wounded soldier that Park Jae-geun's stretcher team carried was a young soldier about twenty years old. When the stretcher team members placed the wounded soldier on the stretcher, the wounded soldier opened his eyes and looked at them kindly, and Park Jae-geun also looked at the wounded soldier with tears in his eyes. They both wanted to say something from their hearts, but they couldn't say anything because they didn't speak the same language. Park Jae-geun, fearing that the wounded soldier would feel even a little uncomfortable, patiently arranged the wounded soldier comfortably before lifting the stretcher. On the way, he thought: the wounds of the wounded soldier would be frozen in the cold weather of November, so he took off his cotton coat and gently covered the wounded soldier.

　　The mountain road was very steep, and it was also a pitch-black night. While carrying the wounded soldier, they had to avoid enemy bombing at any time. Sometimes they crawled on the rocks on their knees, and sometimes they lifted the stretcher high and walked on the steep slopes on their toes. In this way, Park Jae-geun's stretcher team completed the twelve-kilometer mountain road, resting only once in the middle, and arrived at their destination ahead of schedule.

　　When parting with the young wounded soldier, Park Jae-geun gestured to him, expressing his hope that he would recover soon. The wounded soldier also nodded with a smile, his eyes already filled with tears. He was deeply moved by the kind care of this Korean farmer.

　　On the third day, November 5, Park Jae-geun's stretcher team finished their work of carrying the wounded early, but Park Jae-geun did not sleep until 11:00 p.m. At this moment, an emergency notice came, asking them to rush to the forward medical station to transport the wounded again.

　　Park Jae-geun immediately stood up and left, shouting as he walked, "The wounded Volunteers are waiting for us! Let's go!" So the stretcher team members hurriedly got up and followed him. They ran twelve kilometers of steep mountain road in one breath, arriving at the medical station in less than two hours.

　　As soon as they arrived, they put all the wounded there on stretchers and hurried back. The wounded soldier that Park Jae-geun was carrying was another young soldier, who had been seriously wounded in the leg. In November, after midnight, the weather was as cold as ice. Park Jae-geun took off his cotton coat again and covered the wounded soldier's injured thigh. Although his injury was very serious, he could still feel the intimate, brotherly affection of Park Jae-geun. He repeatedly said in a choked voice, "I'm sorry! I'm sorry!"

　　At around 3:00 a.m., just as the stretcher team was about to descend the Caizhendong hillside, along with the emergency air raid signal, the heavy rumble of the enemy's bomber group became closer and closer. Then, the enemy planes dropped flares and began bombing.

　　The stretcher team calmly sheltered the wounded in the deepest ravines. At this time, enemy bombs were constantly exploding around them.

　　"Don't panic, let's save the wounded first!" Park Jae-geun shouted, covering the wounded soldier with his body. At this moment, a bomb landed four or five meters away from him. Shrapnel and gravel hit Park Jae-geun, and he was seriously injured all over his body. He immediately fell down and lost consciousness, but the wounded soldier under him was not injured at all by the bomb.

　　"Come and save my old man!" the wounded soldier shouted, struggling to help up the Korean farmer who was injured protecting his life. When people heard the wounded soldier's half-crying, half-shouting voice, they all ran over, quickly picked up Park Jae-geun, put him on a stretcher, and immediately sent him to the field hospital.

　　In the field hospital, the moving story of Park Jae-geun sacrificing himself to protect the wounded Volunteers immediately spread. The hospital staff and the wounded who could move gathered around Park Jae-geun's bed, waiting for him to wake up. After several hours of emergency treatment, Park Jae-geun barely regained consciousness. When he opened his eyes, the first thing he asked was, "How is that wounded comrade? Is the wounded soldier I was carrying alright?..."

　　His words were like an electric current passing through the hearts of everyone in the ward. Someone said to him, "The comrade you saved was not injured at all. He is fine now. He is very worried about your injuries!" Hearing people tell him this, he seemed very satisfied, nodded, and then said, "Be sure to take good care of him." A smile appeared on the corner of his mouth, and he closed his eyes, leaving this world like a dream, leaving his comrades.

　　When the news of the glorious sacrifice of this great internationalist fighter reached the Shangganling front, where fierce fighting was taking place, a flame of anger immediately ignited in the hearts of the Chinese People's Volunteers. A voice of revenge echoed on the position: "We will avenge the martyr Park Jae-geun, who gave his life to save our comrades! Eliminate the frantically invading American aggressors! Successfully end the Battle of Shangganling!"

　　伟大的国际主义战士朴在根
    一九五二年十一月三日，上甘岭战斗正在激烈地进行着，朴在根担架队冒着敌人的炮火，从淮阳郡兰谷面县二里向上甘岭出发了。
    这是上甘岭附近朝鲜农民为支援中国人民志愿军自动组织的担架队中的一个。当朴在根和金志九、崔武勇、卢俊九等人一道组成这支担架队的时候，他对大家说：“我是一个不懂世事的老百姓，可是我却知道一件事情：我们应该献出一切，来支援可爱的中国人民志愿军。”
    出发之前，朴在根想：带点好东西送给志愿军同志们吧！可是想来想去没有什么东西好送。他家就住在离火线不远的地方，什么东西都被美国飞机炸掉了。最后他想起有人说志愿军战士们在坑道里作战缺水喝，就包了一大包萝卜放在担架上带到前线去。他对他的妻子李玉仙说：“如果这是志愿军同志们爱吃的苹果和梨子，那该多好！”
    当天傍晚，他们到达了担架队联络所。
    第二天，朴在根担架队在炮烟弹雨中向前方卫生处进发。敌人的炮弹和炸弹常常在不远的地方爆炸着。尤其到了靠近火线的山岭以后，道路格外难走，地翻了，岩石炸碎了，树木横倒了，简直看不出路在哪里；可是这些“不背枪的战士”，为了赶紧去运送伤员，不顾艰难和险阻，翻山越岭，快步前进。
    这时候，志愿军勇士们正在英勇地打击着敌人。许多可歌可泣的英雄就在这时候不断地涌现出来。这更加燃烧起了朴在根和他的担架队员们的国际主义感情，使他更感到必须不惜牺牲一起来完成转运志愿军伤员的任务。
    朴在根的担架队第一次抬送的伤员，是一个二十岁左右的青年战士。当担架队员们把伤员抬在担架上的时候，伤员睁开眼睛亲切地望着他们，朴在根也含着眼泪望着这位伤员。他们彼此都想说点心里的话，可是啥也说不出来，因为他们语言不通。朴在根唯恐伤员感到一点不舒服，就耐心地把伤员安置得妥妥贴贴之后才抬起担架。在途中他想：十一月大冷天会冻了伤员的伤口，又把自己的棉袄脱下来，轻轻地盖在伤员身上。
    山路很险峻，又加上是漆黑的深夜，抬着伤员还要随时躲避敌机的轰炸。他们有时就用膝盖在岩石上爬着，也有时把担架抬得高高的，用脚尖在陡坡上走。朴在根担架队队员们就这样走完了十二公里的山路，中途只休息了一次，提前赶到了目的地。
    在和年轻的伤员分手的时候，朴在根比比划划地打着手势向他表示：希望他早日恢复健康。伤员也笑着点了点头，他的眼睛里已经充满了泪水，他被这位朝鲜农民亲切的照顾深深感动了。
    第三天，十一月五日，朴在根担架队抬伤员的工作结束得很早，但朴在根直到深夜十一点钟还没有睡。就在这时候忽然来了个紧急通知，要他们赶到前方卫生处再运一次伤员。
    朴在根立刻站起就走，并且边走边喊：“志愿军伤员等着咱们呢！快走啊！”于是担架队员们都急忙跟他起身了。他们一口气跑过了十二公里的险峻的山路，不到两个钟头就来到卫生处了。
    他们一到地方就把那里的伤员都抬上担架，赶快往回走。朴在根抬的伤员又是一个青年战士，这个战士的腿上负了重伤。十一月的天气，一过午夜，就冷得像冰一样。朴在根又把棉衣脱下来盖在这位战士负了伤的大腿。他虽然伤势很重，但还能感觉出朴在根的亲切的骨肉般的情谊。他用哽咽的声音一再重复着说：“对不起！对不起！”
    夜里三点多钟，正当担架队的行列快走下采珍洞山坡的时候，随着紧急空袭的信号，敌人的轰炸机群沉重的隆隆声越来越近了，接着敌机就投下了照明弹，并且开始轰炸。
    担架队从容地把伤员们掩护在最深的山沟里。这时候，敌人的炸弹不断地在他们周围爆炸着。
    “不要慌，咱们先来救伤员！”朴在根一面喊着，一面就用自己的身体盖在伤员的身上。就在这时候，一颗炸弹落在离他四、五公尺以外的地方，破片和碎石打到朴在根身上，他全身负了很重的伤，立刻跌倒昏迷过去了，但他身下的伤员却没有被这颗炸弹打伤一点。
    “快来救老爹啊！”伤员一面挣扎着扶起这位为保护他的生命而负伤的朝鲜农民，一面叫喊起来。人们听到伤员的半哭半喊的声音都跑了过来，赶快把朴在根抱起放在担架上，马上把他送到野战医院里去了。
    在野战医院里，朴在根舍身救护志愿军伤员的动人事迹立刻传开了。医院的工作人员，能够走动的伤员都围拢在朴在根的病床前等待着他苏醒过来。经过几个钟头的紧急治疗以后，朴在根才勉强恢复了知觉。当他睁开眼睛的时候，第一句话就问：“那位伤员同志怎么样啦？我抬的那位伤员不要紧吗？……”
    他的话像一股电流一样通过了病房里每个人的心。有人对他说：“你救出来的那个同志一点也没有受伤，他现在很好，倒是他很担心你的伤呢！”听到人们这样告诉他，他好像很满足了，点了点头，接着又说：“千万要好好照顾他。”他的嘴角上露出一丝微笑，就闭上了眼睛，像睡梦一样离开了这个世界，离开了他的战友们。
    当这位伟大的国际主义战士光荣牺牲的消息传到正在进行着激烈战斗的上甘岭阵地的时候，中国人民志愿军战士们的心中立刻燃起了愤怒的火焰，阵地上响起一片复仇的声音：“我们要替为拯救我们的战友而献出生命的朴在根烈士复仇！消灭疯狂进犯的美国侵略军！胜利地结束上甘岭战斗！”
