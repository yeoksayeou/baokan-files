Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, June 21st -- In response to the censure from world public opinion, U.S. military commander General Clark issued a statement on the 21st regarding the Li Seung-man's forced retention of 26,000 prisoners of war, attempting to shirk the responsibility that the U.S. military authorities should bear for this event.

In his statement, Clark said on the one hand that the Li Seung-man group’s action of "releasing" tens of thousands of prisoners of war "raises suspicion that the South Korean government and the United Nations Command are in collusion to evade or violate the prisoner of war agreement recently reached at Panmunjom." However, on the other hand, he insisted: "Such suspicion is completely unfounded. No such collusion has occurred, and the United Nations Command has not participated in this completely unauthorized action. The entire responsibility should be borne by President Li and the Korean government."

Is the matter really as Clark says? On the contrary, people have ample reason to point out that the U.S. military authorities bear serious responsibility for conniving at the Li Seung-man group's forced retention of prisoners of war.

Clark says the entire responsibility should be borne by the Li Seung-man group, as if the Li Seung-man puppet troops do not belong to Clark's command. However, in his letter to Li Seung-man on the 19th, Clark said that Li Seung-man's troops were "under my control." He said that since the summer of 1950, Li Seung-man had handed over command of the South Korean army to the Commander-in-Chief of the United Nations forces. He said: "I have always believed, and still believe, that I have complete command authority over all land, sea, and air forces of Korea." Since Clark has "complete command authority" over the Li Seung-man puppet troops, then the U.S. side absolutely cannot escape the serious responsibility for the crimes committed by the Li Seung-man bandit gang under his command.

It should also be pointed out that the prisoners of war who were taken away by the Li Seung-man bandit gang were detained by the United Nations forces. The U.S. State Department made it clear in its note to the Swiss government when inviting Switzerland to participate in the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission. The note stated: "The armed forces of Korea, like the armies of the other fifteen United Nations member states in Korea, are under the jurisdiction of the United Nations Command... In particular, with regard to the prisoner of war issue, these prisoners of war are not detained by any one belligerent nation, but by the United Nations Command, and only the United Nations Command is responsible for the control and security of all prisoners of war." Now that more than 26,000 of these prisoners of war have been "released," naturally "only the United Nations Command is responsible," that is to say, only the U.S. military authorities are responsible.

Various facts prove that the U.S. side has adopted a conniving and acquiescent attitude towards the Li Seung-man group's actions. U.S. news agency reporters have continuously revealed that Clark knew long ago that Li Seung-man would take such action. Clark also had to admit in his statement that "We were certainly aware that the Korean government had the ability to take unilateral action to release prisoners of war. We also knew that certain elements in the Korean government had privately and publicly advocated taking such action." However, he did not take effective preventive action. Does this not prove that the U.S. military authorities' connivance at the Li Seung-man group's "release" of those prisoners of war is also a forced retention?

It is worth noting that just as the U.S. side is shifting all responsibility to the Li Seung-man group, the Li Seung-man group is also trying its best to absolve the U.S. side of guilt. According to acting Prime Minister Byun Young-tae of the puppet government, in order to "eliminate the rumors and suspicions of some people that the release of prisoners of war was done in collusion," Li Seung-man made an "explanation" in his letter to Clark on the 19th. However, according to an Associated Press dispatch from Seoul on the 20th, a Li Seung-man confidant who refused to be named admitted: "Our action to release prisoners of war was not unilateral." If people pay attention to some remarks from the U.S. side, the background of the matter becomes even clearer. A United Press International dispatch from New York on the 19th bluntly stated: "Li Seung-man released the prisoners but did not repatriate them. In effect, he did in one day what the United Nations Command has been trying to do more slowly and legally for two years." An Associated Press news analyst also admitted on the 18th: "Li Seung-man has publicly done what the allies threatened to do during the negotiations, which is to release anti-communist North Korean prisoners of war."

Now that Clark says he has "complete command authority over all land, sea, and air forces of Korea," and yet resolutely denies having "collusion" with the Li Seung-man group, then he has no reason not to exercise his "command authority" and bring back all the prisoners of war forcibly detained by the Li Seung-man group.

### 纵容默许李承晚集团强迫扣留战俘  美方绝对逃不掉应负的严重责任

    纵容默许李承晚集团强迫扣留战俘
    美方绝对逃不掉应负的严重责任
    【新华社开城二十一日电】由于世界舆论的责难，美军总司令克拉克在二十一日就李承晚强迫扣留二万六千名战俘的事件发表声明，企图推脱美军当局对于这个事件所应负的责任。
    克拉克在声明中一方面说，李承晚集团“释放”成千成万战俘的行动，“使人怀疑韩国政府和联合国军司令部串通一气来规避或破坏最近在板门店达成的战俘协议”。可是，另一方面他又一口咬定说：“这种怀疑是完全没有根据的，决没有这种串通的情势发生，联合国军司令部也根本没有参加这个完全未经许可的行动。全部责任全然应该由李总统和韩国政府来担负。”
    事情难道真的是像克拉克所说的这样的么？正相反，人们具有充分的根据，指出美军当局对于纵容李承晚集团强迫扣留战俘是负有严重的责任的。
    克拉克说全部责任应由李承晚集团担负，那末，李承晚伪军似乎是不属于克拉克指挥的了。但是，克拉克在十九日给李承晚的信中说，李承晚军队是在他“控制之下的”。他说，从一九五零年夏天以来，李承晚就把南朝鲜军队的指挥权交给了联合国军总司令。他说：“我一直认为，并且现在仍然认为，我对韩国的一切陆、海、空军部队有着完全的指挥权。”克拉克既然对李承晚伪军有“完全的指挥权”，那末，美方就绝不能逃避对在他指挥下的李承晚匪帮所犯罪行的严重责任。
    还应当指出，被李承晚匪帮押走的战俘，是由联合国军负责拘押的。美国国务院在邀请瑞士参加中立国遣返委员会时给瑞士政府的照会中说得很明白。照会说：“韩国的武装部队和在朝鲜的其他十五个联合国会员国的军队一样，都是处于联合国军司令部的管辖之下的。……特别是关于战俘问题，这些战俘并不是由任何一个交战国家拘押的，而是由联合国军司令部扣押的，唯有联合国军总司令部负责所有战俘的管制和警卫工作。”现在这些战俘中有二万六千多人被“释放”了，自然“唯有联合国军总司令部负责”，也就是说唯有美军当局负责。
    种种事实证明美方对李承晚集团的行动采取了纵容默许的态度。美国通讯社记者曾不断透露过克拉克早就知道李承晚将会做出这种行为，克拉克在他的声明中也不能不承认，“我们当然认识到韩国政府有能力采取释放战俘的片面行动。我们也知道韩国政府中的某些分子曾私下和公开地鼓吹采取这种行动。”但是，他没有采取有效的预防行动。这难道不是证明美军当局纵容李承晚集团“释放”那些战俘也就是加以强迫扣留吗？
    值得注意的是，正当美方把全部责任推给李承晚集团的时候，李承晚集团也竭力替美方脱罪。据伪政府代理国务总理卞荣泰说：为了“消除某些方面人士的谣言和猜疑，说释放战俘是串通好作的”，李承晚曾在十九日给克拉克的信中进行“解释”。可是，据美联社汉城二十日电透露，一个拒绝公布姓名的李承晚亲信却承认：“我们释放战俘的行动不是单方面的”。人们如果再注意到来自美国方面的一些言论，事情的背景就更加清楚了。合众社纽约十九日电就曾露骨地说：“李承晚释放了俘虏，但是没有遣返他们。实际上，他在一天当中做了联合国军司令部两年来一直在想比较缓慢而合法地做的事。”美联社新闻分析家十八日也承认：“李承晚公开地做出了盟军曾经在谈判期间扬言过的事，就是释放反共的北朝鲜战俘。”
    现在，克拉克既然说他对“韩国的一切陆、海、空军部队有着完全的指挥权”，而又断然否认和李承晚集团有“串通”；那么，他就没有理由不行使他的“指挥权”，把被李承晚集团强迫扣留的战俘全部追回来。
