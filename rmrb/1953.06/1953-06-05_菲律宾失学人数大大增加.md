Xinhua News Agency, Manila: Due to the Quirino government of the Philippines cutting education funding to increase military spending, the number of Filipino children and youth out of school has greatly increased. During the last academic year, approximately half of the school-age children in the Philippines were already without access to education, and the number of out-of-school children is even higher this academic year. In Philippine public primary schools, secondary schools, and universities alone, there are more than 500,000 fewer students this academic year compared to the last.

    菲律宾失学人数大大增加
    【新华社讯】马尼拉消息：由于菲律宾季里诺政府削减教育拨款以增加军费开支，菲律宾儿童和青年失学的人数已经大大增加。在上一学年期间，菲律宾已约有一半学龄儿童没有书读，本学年期间失学人数更多。仅以菲律宾公立小学、中学和大学来说，本学年即比上学年减少了五十多万学生。
