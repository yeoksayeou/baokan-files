The Ministry of Heavy Industry of the Central Government convened responsible cadres from the basic construction departments of its affiliated specialized bureaus and managers of engineering companies in North China, East China, Central South China, and other regions from June 8th to 10th to review the progress of the movement against waste, against lack of responsibility, and to establish responsibility systems. The meeting focused on discussing the steps and methods to further deepen this movement.

The movement against waste, against lack of responsibility, and to establish responsibility systems in the construction enterprises affiliated with the Ministry of Heavy Industry within the customs was launched under the following circumstances: Most units were only established this year, with employees coming from all directions, with no clear direction in their work, leading cadres lacking management experience, and very poor employee welfare conditions. Some units had already started work due to urgent engineering tasks; some were tensely carrying out construction preparation work; and some had just been established and launched a struggle against bureaucracy. Under these circumstances, thanks to the leadership and assistance of the Ministry of Heavy Industry and its affiliated specialized bureaus, except for individual units that were still in the preparation stage, the vast majority of construction departments had successively launched movements against waste, against lack of responsibility, and to establish responsibility systems, and had achieved considerable results. For example, the Taiyuan Chemical Zone Engineering Company and the Andingmenwai construction site of the Beijing Engineering Office were in a very chaotic situation before the movement: labor discipline was lax, with some people taking money without working; work efficiency was very low, such as bricklayers only laying an average of forty bricks per person per day; and some people were constantly arguing about wages and food. The Chemical Industry Administration clearly pointed out that the occurrence of these problems was mainly due to the lack of a system and no one being responsible for various tasks; secondly, political work was weak. Afterwards, a forum was held for technical and management personnel, and education was conducted among workers through a combination of large classes and group discussions. Employees consciously exposed many problems, and criticism and self-criticism were initially launched. After self-education, the masses improved their awareness, and the chaotic situation began to improve. The phenomenon of workers not listening to the instructions of group leaders disappeared, material managers felt that their work was easier, and the steel bar group increased production from 80 bars bent per day to more than 200.

However, from the perspective of the overall movement, there were still two main problems: First, some cadres still placed the movement in opposition to current work, believing that the movement delayed construction. Therefore, some units divided the work among the leading cadres, with some engaged in the movement and some engaged in work, with no connection to each other; or cadres who understood engineering managed construction, and cadres who did not understand engineering engaged in the movement. As a result, the movement was not vigorous, and the phenomena of no one being responsible and waste continued to occur. Second, some units did not carry out this movement with leadership, steps, and purpose, but rather launched the masses to expose problems and establish systems in a boundless manner, wanting to review everything and establish everything. As a result, the movement was left to its own devices, and leading cadres were placed in a passive state.

Through group discussions, everyone clarified the following issues ideologically:

	I. Achieve three requirements through the movement: enlighten employees' awareness and improve their sense of responsibility; promote the comprehensive completion of the basic construction plan; and lay the foundation for improving management level.

	II. The purpose and requirements of the movement are not contradictory to current work, and the reason why some units put the movement in opposition to current work is first because some cadres have no idea what is going on and do not understand that the key problem in current work is that no one is responsible or irresponsible for various tasks. Secondly, some units did not grasp the key issues and launched the masses to expose problems in a boundless manner, putting the work in a passive position, and thus feeling that the movement delayed the work.

	III. The anti-bureaucracy movement is also not contradictory to this movement, because the bureaucracy of construction enterprises is mainly concentrated in problems such as large waste, poor quality, and lack of responsibility; leading the anti-waste, anti-lack of responsibility, and establishment of responsibility systems in a planned manner is a concrete way to fight bureaucracy.

	IV. Some cadres mistakenly believe that mobilizing the masses means mobilizing workers, and do not realize that improving management requires the participation of technical and management personnel to effectively establish and implement the responsibility system. Therefore, the meeting pointed out that while mobilizing workers, it is necessary to seriously mobilize technical and management personnel and rely on them to establish the responsibility system and implement it.

In terms of approach, the meeting pointed out that leaders must lead the movement and rely on and utilize existing functional organizations to carry out work. If only relying on temporary institutions, the movement will be isolated and disconnected from work; once the movement ends, the responsibility system will collapse. In the movement, in addition to exposing and reviewing the phenomenon of lack of responsibility, it is also necessary to establish positive examples and set models so that everyone has a direction to learn from. This approach is also very necessary in implementing the responsibility system. Units that have already fallen into a passive position should sort out the problems raised by employees, quickly resolve those that need to be resolved urgently, and explain the reasons to the masses for those that cannot be resolved immediately; then, systematically and step-by-step, put the movement back on track. All construction units (Party A) should also launch a movement to establish responsibility systems. If only Party B launches this movement and Party A does not, it will not be easy for Party B to implement the responsibility system. Party A should establish an administrative responsibility system, discover problems through balancing work, and establish various responsibility systems, such as drawing, material and equipment supply, and financial responsibility systems.

In addition, the meeting also focused on discussing the specific content of the responsibility system. At the same time, it was decided not to set a uniform deadline for the movement, and each unit should specifically arrange the time according to the progress of the movement, until the responsibility system is effectively established.

### 重工业部召集华北等地工程公司经理等开会  决定深入开展建立责任制运动

    重工业部召集华北等地工程公司经理等开会
    决定深入开展建立责任制运动
    中央重工业部于六月八日至十日召集所属各专业局基本建设处负责干部及所属华北、华东、中南等地工程公司经理开会，检查反浪费、反无人负责、建立责任制运动进展情况，并着重讨论了深入开展这一运动的步骤和方法。
    重工业部所属关内施工企业反浪费、反无人负责、建立责任制运动是在这样情况下开展起来的：绝大多数单位今年才建立起来，职工来自各方，一切工作没有头绪，领导干部缺乏管理经验，职工福利条件很差；有的单位工程任务紧急已经开工；有的单位正紧张进行施工准备工作；又有一些单位成立不久就开展了反官僚主义的斗争。在这种情况之下，由于重工业部及其所属各专业局的领导与帮助，除个别单位还在进行准备工作外，绝大多数施工部门已先后开展了反浪费、反无人负责，建立责任制运动，并已取得了不少成绩。如太原化工区工程公司、北京工程处安定门外工地，在运动前情况非常混乱：劳动纪律松懈，有的人拿钱不上班；工作效率很低，如瓦工每人每天平均只砌四十块砖；还有些人为了工资与伙食等问题，吵闹不休。化学工业管理局明确指出这些问题的发生，主要是没有制度，各项工作无人负责；其次是政治工作薄弱。之后，召开了技术人员、管理人员座谈会，在工人中采取上大课与小组讨论相结合的办法进行教育。职工自觉地揭发了许多问题，初步展开了批评与自我批评。群众经过自我教育，提高了觉悟，混乱情况开始好转。工人不听小组长指挥的现象没有了，材料管理人员感到工作好做了，钢筋小组由以前每天弯八十根提高到二百多根。
    但是从整个运动情况来看，还存在着两个主要问题：第一，有些干部还是把运动与当前工作对立起来，认为运动耽误施工。于是有的单位就在领导干部中分了工，有的搞运动，有的搞工作，互不相关；或者是懂工程的干部管施工，不懂工程的干部搞运动。因而运动劲头不大，无人负责与浪费现象仍然不断发生。第二，有些单位开展这个运动不是有领导，有步骤，有目的地进行的，而是漫无边际地发动群众揭发问题、建立制度，什么都要检讨，什么都想建立。结果使得运动自流，领导干部陷于被动状态。
    经过小组讨论，大家思想上明确了以下几个问题：
       一、通过运动达到三个要求：启发职工觉悟，提高责任心；促进全面地完成基本建设计划；为提高管理水平打下基础。
    二、运动的目的与要求与当前工作没有矛盾，而有些单位所以把运动与当前工作对立起来，首先是因为有些干部心中无数，不了解当前工作中的关键问题就是各项工作无人负责或不负责任。其次，有些单位没有掌握关键问题，就漫无边际地发动群众揭发问题，使工作陷于被动，于是感到运动耽误了工作。
    三、反官僚主义与这一运动也无矛盾，因为施工企业的官僚主义主要集中表现在浪费大，质量低劣，无人负责等问题上；有领导地反浪费、反无人负责，建立责任制，就是具体地反官僚主义。
    四、有些干部错误地认为发动群众就是发动工人，没有认识到要改善管理，离开技术人员与管理人员，就不能很好地把责任制建立起来。因此，会议指出：在发动工人的同时，必须认真发动技术人员与管理人员，依靠他们把责任制建立起来，并贯彻下去。
    在做法上，会议指出：首长必须领导运动，依靠与运用现有职能机构进行工作。如果只依靠临时机构，就会把运动孤立起来，与工作脱节；运动一结束，责任制就会垮台。在运动中，除揭发与检讨无人负责现象以外，还必须树立正面的典型，作出样子，让大家有学习的方向。这种作法在贯彻责任制中也是很必要的。已经陷于被动的单位，应把职工所提问题加以整理，急需解决的迅速解决，不能即刻解决的应向群众讲清道理；然后有计划、有步骤地使运动转入正轨。所有建设单位（甲方）也应开展建立责任制运动，只是乙方开展这个运动，而甲方不搞，则乙方的责任制也不容易贯彻。甲方应该建立行政责任制度，通过平衡工作发现问题，把各项责任制建立起来，如图纸、材料设备供应以及财务责任制等。
    此外，会议还着重讨论了责任制的具体内容。同时决定对运动截止时间不作统一规定，各单位应根据运动进展情况具体安排时间，直到把责任制度切实地建立起来为止。
