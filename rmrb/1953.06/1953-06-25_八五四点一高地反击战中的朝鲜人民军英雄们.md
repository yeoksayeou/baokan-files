Last September, the Korean People's Army conducted an outstanding counterattack. The location was Hill 854.1 on the eastern front, which stretched five to six li east to west, and was defended by an enemy battalion. The enemy had occupied this high ground for more than a year and had built relatively strong fortifications on it.

Before the battle began, the commanders and fighters of a certain unit of the Korean People's Army read aloud a letter from Park Deok-ok, the chairman of a certain ri people's committee in Pyongyang, to the soldiers at the front during the final mobilization meeting. The letter said: "On the morning of August 21, American planes bombed our village again, destroying the shacks we had rebuilt on the ruins and our last bit of food. Many compatriots were killed. A woman named Shin died with her eyes still open, her three-year-old child crawling on her chest, looking for milk. Dear comrades at the front! You must avenge us!"

After reading the letter, Lee Won-guk, a member of the Korean Democratic Youth League, stood up with tears in his eyes and firmly requested to join the assault team. He was from Seohewa Township, Inje County, south of Hill 854.1. He had an elderly father and a younger sister at home. He said, "I have looked towards that place from a high point many times, and I can no longer tolerate the enemy's bestial hooves trampling on the land of my hometown!"

Then, Eom Seong-ryong, a Korean Workers' Party member and quartermaster in charge of food, also firmly requested to participate in the battle. His hometown was Songyue Village, south of Hill 854.1, where he had cultivated the land with his own hands. Park Won-jin, an eighteen-year-old Korean Democratic Youth League member and soldier, was so excited that he only said one sentence: "How are our people living!" and then choked up, unable to speak. He handed a letter of determination to the company commander. The letter read: "Resolved to learn from the hero Kim Chang-geol, in the style of Matrosov!"

The battle began at one o'clock in the morning. Fierce artillery fire swept towards the enemy's positions like a storm, blasting the layers of barbed wire in front of the enemy's positions into the air. The soldiers launched an attack with shouts of "Mansei!" (Long live!).

	"Advance! Comrades, avenge the people!" The loud voice of the loudspeaker on the position encouraged the soldiers to advance.

The assault team quickly rushed into the breach, with Lee Won-guk in the lead. He saw the mountains of his hometown, where he had gathered firewood, hunted rabbits and wild goats as a child. At that time, there were dense forests, gurgling springs, and the pleasant sounds of birds chirping. Now, the mountains were full of messy fortifications, and inside the fortifications were the enemy. Fury burned in his chest, and he ran like lightning towards the first bunker facing him, throwing a grenade... In less than two minutes, three enemy heavy machine gun firing points and two light machine gun firing points were destroyed by him.

The assault team rushed into the enemy's tank positions. Three enemy tanks were firing. Platoon leader Han Gil-ryong, under the cover of the soldiers' firepower, quickly inserted himself behind a tank and threw two grenades at the bottom of the enemy tank, setting it on fire. At the same time, soldier Ro Jae-hong also destroyed an enemy tank. The remaining enemy tank tried to escape but was caught up and destroyed by Han Gil-ryong.

At this time, another assault team was blocked on a slope by the enemy's crossfire. Enemy machine gun bullets whizzed around the assault team soldiers lying on the ground. At this time, the assault team leader reorganized the firepower and then said to the soldiers in a solemn voice: "For the motherland, for the people, for the honor of our army, I order: Prepare for another charge."

Suddenly, a figure stood up in the darkness. It was Shin Ki-cheol, the labor party cell committee member (branch secretary) and squad leader. He said, "I am a labor party member, I swear to fight for the motherland to the death. I call on all labor party members to charge forward with me!" The labor party members stood up, the democratic youth league members also stood up, and then all the soldiers stood up...

The bugle sounded for the charge, and a wave of "Mansei!" shouts erupted across the mountains. The brave men charged towards the hilltop like a tide.

Quartermaster Eom Seong-ryong shot at the enemy while running. A bullet pierced his chest a dozen meters away from the enemy's bunker, and he fell. Park Won-jin and another soldier rushed to his side. He struggled to pull out a grenade and handed it to Park Won-jin, saying, "Advance, comrade! My hometown is ahead, you... must... destroy the enemy ahead for me..." Eom Seong-ryong shed his last drop of blood on the land of his hometown.

At this time, Shin Ki-cheol was also seriously injured six or seven meters away from the enemy's bunker. He struggled to stand up and shouted back, "In front of the labor party members, there are no obstacles that cannot be broken through! Comrades, follow me..." He pounced forward bravely, and an enemy machine gun firing point went silent.

Park Won-jin, who was following behind Shin Ki-cheol, saw Shin Ki-cheol lying on the enemy's firing point. He shouted in grief, "Avenge the suffering people, avenge Shin Ki-cheol and Eom Seong-ryong!" He rushed towards the last enemy firing point blocking the assault team's advance. After several explosions of grenades, the dying enemy fired even more frantically. Then, the flashing muzzle suddenly went dark, and the enemy's machine gun was silent. The assault team occupied the enemy's position, annihilating the entire enemy battalion.

When dawn broke in the east, the soldiers discovered the body of labor party cell committee member Shin Ki-cheol in front of an enemy heavy machine gun fortification. His chest was facing the muzzle of the enemy's heavy machine gun, and his shirt and the party membership card bag worn close to his body were stained red with blood. In front of another enemy machine gun fortification, the soldiers found Korean Democratic Youth League member Park Won-jin's chest pressed tightly against the enemy's machine gun muzzle, his stiff hands still tightly grasping the enemy's machine gun barrel protruding from the muzzle...

    八五四点一高地反击战中的朝鲜人民军英雄们
    新华社记者　李犁
    去年九月，朝鲜人民军进行了一次出色的反击战。地点是东线八五四点一高地，这个高地东西长达五、六里，守敌有一个营。敌人在这个高地上盘踞了一年多，在上面修筑了比较强固的工事。
    战斗发起之前，朝鲜人民军某部的指挥员和战斗员们在最后一次动员会上，朗读了平壤市某里人民委员长朴德玉给前方将士的一封信，信上说：“八月二十一日早晨，美国飞机又轰炸了我们的村庄，把我们在废墟上新搭起来的窝棚和最后一点粮食都炸光了。许多同胞被炸死了。一位姓申的妇女死后还睁着眼睛，她的三岁的孩子爬在她的胸前寻奶吃。前线的亲人们！你们要为我们报仇啊！”
    读完信以后，朝鲜民主青年同盟盟员李元国眼睛里含着泪水站了起来，坚决要求参加突击组。他是八五四点一高地南面的麟蹄郡瑞和面人，他家里有年老的父亲和小妹妹。他说：“我曾经在高处向那边眺望过好多次，我再不能忍受敌人的兽蹄践踏我们家乡的土地！”
    接着，朝鲜劳动党党员管理伙食的特务长严圣龙也坚决要求参加战斗。他的家乡是八五四点一高地南面的松鱼月里，那里有他亲手开垦过的田地。十八岁的朝鲜民主青年同盟盟员、战士朴元真激动得只说了一句：“我们的人民是怎样活着的啊！”便哽咽得说不出话来。他把一份决心书交给连长。决心书上写着：“决心学习马特洛索夫式的英雄金昌杰！”
    战斗开始在午夜一时。猛烈的炮火狂风暴雨般地卷向敌军阵地，把敌军阵地层层的铁丝网炸得飞上了半空。战士们在“满—塞！”（万岁）的喊声中发起了冲锋。
       “前进啊！同志们，为人民复仇！”阵地上扩音机宏亮的声音鼓舞着战士们前进。
    突击队迅速冲进了突破口，战士李元国冲在最前面。他看到了自己家乡的山，他少年时曾在这山上打过柴，打过兔子和野羊。那时，山上有密密的树林，哗哗流动的泉水和飞鸟悦耳的鸣声。现在，满山都是乱七八糟的工事，工事里面是敌人。怒火在他胸中燃烧，他飞一般地跑向迎面的第一个地堡，扔出了一颗手雷……。不到两分钟，三个敌人的重机枪火力点和两个轻机枪火力点被他消灭了。
    突击队冲进了敌人的坦克阵地。有三辆敌人的坦克正在打炮。排长韩吉龙在战士们的火力掩护下，迅速插到一辆坦克的后面，对准敌人的坦克底下扔了两个手雷，把敌人的坦克炸得烧了起来。同时，战士罗栽洪也炸毁了一辆敌人的坦克。敌人剩下的一辆坦克夺路就跑，又被韩吉龙赶上去炸毁了。
    这时，另一支突击队被敌人的交叉火力阴挡在一个斜坡上。敌人机枪子弹在伏在地上的突击队战士们周围嗖嗖地嚣叫着。这时，突击队连长重新布置了火力，然后，用庄严的声音对战士们说：“为了祖国，为了人民，为了我军的荣誉，我命令：准备再一次冲锋。”
    黑影里突然站起一个人，他是劳动党细胞委员长（支部书记）、班长申基哲，他说：“我是劳动党员，誓死为祖国战斗，我号召所有的劳动党员跟我一齐奋勇向前冲！”劳动党员们站起来了，民主青年同盟盟员们也站起来了，接着全体战士都站起来了……。
    冲锋号响了，漫山遍野爆发起一片“满—塞！”的喊声，勇士们像潮水一样冲向山头。
    特务长严圣龙边跑边向敌人射击，在距离敌人地堡十几公尺的地方一颗子弹穿透了他的胸膛，他跌倒了。朴元真和另一个战士赶到他的身边，他吃力地掏出手雷递给朴元真说：“前进吧，战友！前面就是我的家乡，你们……一定……要替我消灭前面的敌人……。”严圣龙把最后一滴血，洒在自己家乡的土地上。
    这时，申基哲也在距离敌人地堡六、七公尺远的地方负了重伤，他奋力站起来，回身喊道：“在劳动党员面前，没有突不破的障碍！同志们，跟我来……。”他勇猛地向前扑去，敌人的一个机枪火力点不响了。
    跟在申基哲后面的朴元真看到申基哲伏在敌人的火力点上，他悲痛地高喊：“为受难的人民报仇，为申基哲和严圣龙报仇！”他向最后一个阻挡突击队前进的敌人火力点冲去。接连几声手雷的爆炸声后，垂死挣扎的敌人竟更疯狂地发射起来，紧接着，火光闪闪的射口突然一黑，敌人的机枪没有声音了。突击队占领了敌人的阵地，将守敌一个营全部歼灭。
    当东方现出曙光的时候，战士们在敌人的一挺重机枪工事跟前发现了劳动党细胞委员长申基哲的遗体，他的胸膛对着敌人重机枪的射口，上衣和贴身挂的党证袋都被鲜血浸红了。在另一个敌军机枪工事前，战士们又发现了朝鲜民主青年同盟盟员朴元真的胸膛紧抵着敌人的机枪口，他的僵硬了的双手还紧紧地抓着伸出射口的敌人的机枪筒……。
