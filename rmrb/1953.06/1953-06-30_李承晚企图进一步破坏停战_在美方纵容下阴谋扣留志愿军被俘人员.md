Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, June 29th: This reporter reports: After Syngman Rhee, with U.S. connivance, forcibly detained a large number of captured Korean People's Army soldiers, he is now brewing a new conspiracy to forcibly detain a large number of captured Chinese People's Volunteers.

The U.S.'s obvious attitude of indulgence has made Syngman Rhee increasingly rampant. Not content with detaining a large number of Korean prisoners of war, Syngman Rhee is also colluding with the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang in an attempt to "release" the currently detained Chinese People's Volunteer prisoners of war in South Korea, that is, forcibly send them to Taiwan.

In fact, the Rhee-Chiang bandit gang has colluded to begin this sinister plan. According to the Associated Press, on June 20th, Syngman Rhee escorted 107 Chinese People's Volunteer prisoners of war from Busan's No. 2 prisoner-of-war camp, which is entirely guarded by U.S. troops. The U.S. later asked Syngman Rhee's police to return 57 prisoners of war, while the remaining 50 prisoners of war are still in the hands of Syngman Rhee's police. A U.S. spokesman said that they "have no way" to recover these still-detained Chinese prisoners of war.

At the same time, in the Moseulpo prisoner-of-war camp on Jeju Island, where Chinese prisoners of war who are not directly repatriated are detained, Kuomintang secret agents have repeatedly created so-called demonstrations demanding "release".

With the encouragement of the U.S.'s indulgence, the collusion between Syngman Rhee and the Kuomintang remnants regarding the detention of prisoners of war has further intensified. U.S. news agencies have continuously transmitted news from Taiwan that the Kuomintang bandit gang "welcomes" the "released" Chinese prisoners of war to go to Taiwan. According to the International News Service, the Kuomintang bandit gang has already submitted a plan to the U.S. government to forcibly detain prisoners of war. Wang Dongyuan, the Kuomintang bandit gang's "ambassador" to South Korea, has repeatedly visited Byun Young-tae, the acting Prime Minister of South Korea, requesting the "release" of Chinese prisoners of war. At the third anniversary commemoration of the Korean War held in Busan on June 25th, the Syngman Rhee bandit gang openly demanded the immediate "release" of Chinese prisoners of war who are not directly repatriated. From all these indications, the situation has clearly developed to a serious point.

Observers here pointed out that after Syngman Rhee's provocative act of forcibly detaining prisoners of war, the U.S. has never taken any effective measures to stop it. Even after the U.S. military completely took over the prisoner-of-war camps, Syngman Rhee continued to escort prisoners of war from the camps. The U.S. does not ask Syngman Rhee to recover those prisoners of war who were taken away. Now, Syngman Rhee and the Kuomintang bandit gang are colluding with each other, attempting to forcibly detain Chinese People's Volunteer prisoners of war and further sabotage the armistice. This deserves serious attention from the world. Since Clark admitted that all prisoner-of-war camps are under his jurisdiction, he cannot escape his serious responsibility for Syngman Rhee's provocative act of forcibly detaining more than 27,000 prisoners of war. The U.S. must bear full and direct responsibility for any events that occur in the prisoner-of-war camps.

### 李承晚企图进一步破坏停战  在美方纵容下阴谋扣留志愿军被俘人员

    李承晚企图进一步破坏停战
    在美方纵容下阴谋扣留志愿军被俘人员
   【新华社开城二十九日电】本社特派记者报道：李承晚在美方纵容之下强迫扣留了大批朝鲜人民军被俘人员之后，现在正在酝酿一个强迫扣留大批中国人民志愿军被俘人员的新阴谋。
    美方明显的纵容态度，使李承晚越来越猖狂了。李承晚对于扣留大批朝鲜战俘还不满足，他还和蒋介石匪帮合谋，企图在南朝鲜“释放”现在被拘留的中国人民志愿军被俘人员，就是说，强迫把他们送到台湾去。
    事实上，李蒋匪帮已合谋开始这一罪恶计划。据美联社报道，李承晚在六月二十日从完全由美国军队看守的釜山第二号战俘营中押走了一百零七名中国人民志愿军被俘人员。美方后来向李承晚的警察要回了五十七名战俘，其余五十名战俘仍然在李承晚的警察手里。而美方的一个发言人说，他们对于追回这些仍被扣留的中国战俘“没有什么办法”。
    同时，在济州岛上拘留不直接遣返的中国战俘的摹瑟浦战俘营里，国民党特务们接连制造了所谓要求“释放”的示威游行。
    在美国的纵容鼓励之下，李承晚和国民党残匪之间关于扣留战俘的勾结进一步加紧了。美国通讯社从台湾不断传出国民党匪帮“欢迎”被“释放”的中国战俘到台湾去的消息。据国际新闻社报道，国民党匪帮已经向美国政府提出了强迫扣留战俘的计划。国民党匪帮驻南朝鲜的“大使”王东原多次访问南朝鲜的代理总理卞荣泰，要求“释放”中国战俘。在六月二十五日釜山举行的朝鲜战争三周年纪念大会上，李承晚匪帮公开要求立刻“释放”不直接遣返的中国战俘。从所有这些迹象看来，事态显然已经发展到了严重的地步。
    此间观察家指出，美方在李承晚强迫扣留战俘的挑衅行为发生以后，一直没有采取任何有效的措施来加以制止，即使在美国军队完全接管了战俘营以后，李承晚仍然不断从战俘营中押走战俘。而对于那些被架走的战俘，美方也不向李承晚要求追回。现在李承晚和国民党匪帮互相勾结，企图强迫扣留中国人民志愿军被俘人员，进一步破坏停战，这是值得全世界严重注意的。克拉克既然承认所有战俘营都是在他的管辖之下，他决不能逃避他对于李承晚强迫扣留两万七千多名战俘的挑衅行为的严重责任。美方对战俘营中发生的任何事件，必须负起完全的直接的责任。
