Scientific Management of Production
——An Overview of the Planning Management Experience of Anshan Iron and Steel's Medium-Sized Rolling Mill
He Zhuo

The medium-sized rolling mill is a link in the entire chain of Anshan Iron and Steel. Although it is not the most complex one, it is not easy to manage it well.

More than 800 units across the country place orders with it, requiring more than 80 specifications. Its raw material—steel billets—is smelted by the steelmaking plant, rolled by the primary rolling mill, and transported by the Ministry of Transportation's trains. The rolls on the rolling mill are manufactured by the General Machinery Factory. The factory itself is composed of five different sections. The internal and external connections are intricate and complex. Any change in any factor or any imbalance in any link will affect or even disrupt the pace of production. However, the medium-sized mill has been able to arrange these things very well: every few seconds, a red-hot steel billet rolls out of the heating furnace and slides along the roller table into the rolling mill, darting back and forth in the teeth of the rolls—the grooves—and turning into strips of steel. Next to the rolling mill stands a large blackboard, clearly writing how many and what kind of steel products are to be rolled in these eight hours, how many are to be rolled each hour, when and how long each rolling mill is to be changed, and the results of the execution. Workers can know what they should do at any time and whether they have completed the national plan for this hour. What kinds of steel products are to be rolled each month, the order in which they are arranged, when the machines are to be repaired, and when new rolls are to be prepared are all known to the grassroots cadres of each shift and team at the end of the previous month. Every day, if any twists and turns are encountered in the execution of the plan, a phone call is immediately made from the workshop to the factory's production command—the dispatch room. If the problem can be solved by the factory itself, the duty director immediately issues an order to solve it. Now, in this factory, things like arguments and squabbles between different sections, blaming each other for not cooperating well, or coming to the factory director for a few tons of missing raw materials or a missing roll, not being confident in whether the production plan can be completed, being worried and afraid all day long, and not knowing when production will "stall" no longer happen. In the first quarter of this year, it has balancedly completed its plan for nine out of twelve weeks.

The reason it can do this is that it has grasped the basic method of managing production—plan management, and it has also grasped the central link in realizing plan management—operation plans, and has vividly expressed the operation plans with several charts. By simply looking at the charts, it is clear what to do, how much to do, when to do it, with what to do it, by whom to do it, and what the results are for this month, this week, and this day. Rhythmic and balanced production is achieved through this scientific management method.

Just looking at the charts, there are not many items, only some dates, symbols of varieties, numbers, and a few red and blue lines. However, it is not easy to draw these blue lines—operation plan lines—at the end of the previous month. Naturally, if you only want to create a rough, relatively low-level operation plan, you can simply divide the monthly planned output evenly by thirty days based on the national plan, the order contract, and the maintenance plan of the main equipment. However, if you want to create a truly instructive operation plan, you must consider more factors and do more careful calculations. For example, how many steel billets can each heating furnace heat per hour, how much steel can the rolling mill roll per hour, how much can the crane load and unload per hour... For these equipment capabilities and quotas, the medium-sized mill has data accumulated from daily operation records as a basis when preparing operation plans. Whether various raw materials, tools, transportation, water, electricity, gas... are balanced, what are the various consumption quotas, what are the different operation methods and production conditions for various products, what was the completion status of last month's production tasks, whether it is necessary to increase or compensate this month, these also need to be carefully considered or calculated based on recorded data when the medium-sized mill formulates operation plans.

Thus, this does not mean that formulating operation plans is simply a technical calculation and arrangement; the attitude with which these conditions and bases are treated, whether it is passively completing tasks or guiding production through operation plans, makes a big difference. The medium-sized mill follows these ideological principles to prepare operation plans.

Formulating operation plans must have a strong sense of the nation and a sense of the whole. Factory plans are a component of the national plan, and small plans must obey large plans. In the second half of last year, the medium-sized mill had things like this: being willing to roll varieties that were easy to roll, and sometimes not wanting to change varieties immediately even after the ordered quantity was reached, continuing to roll until the end of the shift or until each groove was worn down. In this way, from a quantitative point of view, the factory had exceeded its production, but the country's material balance plan might be disrupted, with urgently needed steel not being rolled out and things that are not currently needed being stockpiled. Now, they have corrected this practice. Producing completely according to the order requirements has become the primary rule that must be followed when preparing plans; not even considering that it may sometimes be very inconvenient to do so, such as changing rolls even if the time falls in the evening and the repair workers are not supposed to be on duty, they resolutely change them according to the prescribed time; even if the grooves on the rolls are not completely worn down, they resolutely remove them; sometimes when important urgent orders come in, they would rather rush to prepare for them and put them at the forefront of the plan. They have realized that: completing the order plan on schedule creates conditions for brother factories to complete their plans on schedule and in a balanced way, and this is how they fulfill their responsibility to the completion of the entire national plan.

Formulating operation plans must be good at finding and using average advanced quotas, so that the plan can have a guiding role in promoting production. When rolling flat steel in mid-October last year, worker Li Shanglin of Class A successfully researched a "iron dustpan," creating a new record of rolling 1,473 pieces in one shift. At this time, the Production Section increased the quota from the original 1,100 pieces per shift to 1,500 pieces, which was 27 pieces more than the highest record. It seemed a bit adventurous; but the Production Section explained the reasons to the workers in detail, and the workers felt confident that they could reach the new quota. Originally, the output of each hour in the shift that created the new record was not the same: in the first hour, just starting work, 96 pieces were rolled; in the second hour, 194 pieces; in the third hour, 195 pieces; in the fourth hour, 220 pieces; in the fifth hour, it dropped to 153 pieces because of changing the saw blade; in the sixth hour, it rose to 224 pieces; in the seventh hour, it dropped again to 175 pieces because of a small malfunction; and in the last hour, it rose again to 213 pieces. The average of the output of these eight hours was 184 pieces per hour. Adding up the output of the five hours exceeding this average—the second, third, fourth, sixth, and eighth hours—and dividing by five, the average advanced quota obtained was 209.5 pieces per hour. When the Production Section set the new quota, it was still calculated according to 200 pieces per hour for the sake of caution, and only 100 pieces were counted for the first hour. A new quota that exceeded the new record but was not adventurous was set in this way. Precisely because they recorded, statistically analyzed, and applied every moment of production activity, they were able to find new average advanced quotas to enrich the operation plans. As Comrade Liu Kegang, Deputy Manager of Anshan Iron and Steel, said: "The implementation of plan management mainly depends on operation plans; whether the operation plans are advanced depends on the quotas, and the quotas should be based on accurate original records; with scientific and advanced quotas, there will be advanced and feasible operation plans."

Operation plans must be comprehensive. Production is not isolated, and operation plans cannot only stipulate the actions of direct production departments. All auxiliary departments surrounding production and other indispensable work must be organized within the operation plan. The more comprehensively these aspects are considered, the greater the accuracy of the operation plan. In addition to output, the medium-sized mill's current operation plans also include raw material (steel billet) supply plans, consumable material (coal, asphalt, yellow dry oil, ...) preparation plans, and preparation plans for tool equipment such as rolls, straightening rolls, and guide plates. These plans are all formulated according to the needs of the direct production part. Only with such comprehensive planning can the operation plan not be a mere scrap of paper.

Formulating operation plans must pay attention to finding and leveraging the potential power of mechanical equipment. The capabilities of some equipment may seem unbalanced on the surface, but if the operation plan is arranged well, this imbalance can be relatively reduced or even eliminated. For example, light rails need to be straightened after rolling, but the capacity of the medium-sized mill's straightening machine is only two-thirds of that of the rolling mill, while large square steel and round steel do not need to be straightened at all. If all the light rails are concentrated in one period of the month to be produced, semi-finished products will be stockpiled next to the straightening machine; if large square steel and round steel are concentrated in one period to be produced, the straightening machine will be "unemployed." Therefore, when preparing operation plans, they always mix varieties that need straightening with varieties that do not need straightening, so that the straightening machine can be used in a balanced way and orders can be completed in a balanced way.

Formulating operation plans must give play to subjective initiative and overcome difficulties that seem to be caused by objective reasons and cannot be overcome. Before this year, the medium-sized mill was known for stockpiling train cars throughout the company. In the first quarter of this year, the Ministry of Transportation implemented a "timed and quantitative operation chart system," limiting the unloading of a car to 30 minutes. This posed a difficult problem for the medium-sized mill: to ensure the balanced delivery of raw materials, it must assist the Ministry of Transportation in implementing this reform; however, the raw material team only had two cranes, which were used to unload steel billets from the train and send them to the heating furnace, and they already felt that it was not enough. However, they still tried their best to find solutions internally, and finally decided to allocate the crane from the repair section to the raw material team, and reformed the wage system of the operating workers. As a result, they unloaded a car in 20 minutes, creating good conditions for the company to implement planned transportation.

Even though the monthly operation plan is formulated after such careful consideration and calculation, it is still impossible to anticipate all the changes in production. Only the monthly plan is not enough to accurately and specifically guide the production activities of each day. The medium-sized mill also formulates weekly and daily operation plans for each week and each shift—eight hours. In this way, there are conditions to grasp various changes occurring in production at any time, actively control them, and not allow them to hinder production. These three plans, one more specific than the other, one more accurate than the other, one guaranteeing the other, none of which can be missing.

The blue lines on the various instruction charts mentioned above are the visualization of these operation plans—it uses a few simple lines to represent many complex texts. On the chart, the red lines that run parallel to the blue lines and are extended every day reveal the daily practical results of the operation plan. Comparing the red lines with the blue lines, one can see all the changes in production and the twists and turns in the execution of the plan, foresee the problems that must be solved in the next day and the next week to achieve the operation plan, discover the budding of advanced and fresh things, and the backward and weak links, and grasp the entire production activity of the entire factory on this day. The combination of advanced, meticulous, accurate, and specific operation plans and instruction charts becomes a powerful tool for guiding production.

However, the transformation from blue lines to red lines is the result of the practice of thousands of employees throughout the factory. Having an operation plan does not mean that the operation plan is implemented; each link producing according to the plan does not mean that unified command is not needed; no matter how meticulously the operation plan is prepared, it does not mean that no changes will occur in production practice. Therefore, there must be a centralized and powerful organization to command, supervise, and inspect the implementation of the operation plan. This organization is the dispatch room. In a corner of the production section office of the medium-sized mill, there are three telephones on the table and several charts hanging on the wall. Day and night, every moment, someone is sitting here, adjusting the imbalances between each link and solving all the contradictions that occur in the process of implementing the plan. This person is the dispatcher who assists the factory director in commanding production. Every eight hours, half an hour before the shift workers arrive at the factory, the on-duty dispatcher of the next shift is already standing in front of the instruction chart, understanding the production situation of the previous shift, seeing how much the previous shift has rolled, how many grooves have not been used up, when the rolls have to be changed, which ones to change, and based on these, immediately arranging the operation plan for the next shift, handing it over to the duty director, and assigning it to each team and group leader. As soon as the workers come to work, they start working according to this plan. At this time, the dispatcher, according to the instructions prompted by the instruction chart, commands the activities of each link, and checks and reminds various preparatory work. For example, when this product is about to be finished rolling, calculate how many steel billets need to be heated based on the finished product rate, quickly notify the raw material team, and tell them which kind of steel billet to load next; at the same time, notify the rolling team to change rolls when rolling to which number of steel billet; if this kind of steel needs to be rolled for a long time, check whether the reserve of steel billets is sufficient. If it is not enough, it has to be proposed to the company's general dispatch room. Because it is the nerve center for commanding the factory's production activities, all the contradictions in production are immediately reflected and concentrated in this place; and the dispatcher must solve these contradictions at any time, so as not to hinder the realization of the operation plan. Once, when rolling light rails, the original plan was that five shifts would be enough with five grooves, but because the quality of the rolls was not accurately estimated, the first shift used up all five grooves. This sudden change happened to occur at night. The on-duty dispatcher immediately made a decision, sent someone to find the workers of the rolling team from their homes, and prepared new rolls overnight, so that production was not interrupted. Another time at night, the on-duty dispatcher suddenly discovered that the coal, which had always been considered not to have problems, was about to be burned out, and the gas in the generator would have to be cut off before dawn, and the entire factory's production would have to be stopped. At this time, the dispatcher immediately sought help from the transportation department and the company's general dispatch room, and brought in a car of coal in the middle of the night, and then rushed to transport it by car for a day the next day, which relieved the threat. This is the work of dispatching and the role of dispatching. The employees of the medium-sized mill say: the factory cannot do without dispatching.

Centralized command requires a tightly organized team, and the factory's dispatching work requires a strict responsibility system. In the medium-sized mill, as in other factories of Anshan Iron and Steel, the person who acts as the factory director for each shift and uses dispatching to command the factory's production is the on-duty director. During these eight hours, he is fully responsible for completing tasks according to the operation plan, ensuring product quality, ensuring production safety, and ensuring the implementation of all instructions from higher levels. Similarly, within the scope of a work section, the on-duty work section leader is fully responsible; in a shift or a group, the shift leader or group leader is fully responsible. The operation of each machine, the maintenance and repair of each water pipe, the temperature of each furnace, and the quality of each finished product are all the responsibility of someone. In the medium-sized mill, anything that is not executed according to the operation plan is called an accident, and the person responsible for each accident can be found. With this series of special responsibility systems: the administrative special responsibility system for cadres above the shift leader level, the post responsibility system among workers, as well as the quality responsibility system, the maintenance responsibility system..., the operation plan and dispatching orders can be implemented, and "the plan is the law" has practical significance.

This responsibility system is built on the basis of democratic management, and the plan must be grasped by the masses to become a force. In the medium-sized mill, when assigning each shift's operation plan, a meeting of shift and group leaders is held to tell everyone what the plan is based on, so that people know why when accepting orders. When they feel that the order is incomplete or unrealistic, the leadership will consider their suggestions and even adopt their correct opinions, withdraw the old order, and issue new instructions. Whether everyone has fulfilled his or her responsibilities is supervised and inspected by the collective. Workers hold a small meeting after each shift to review why the task was not completed in which hour, study the reasons for not completing it, and criticize those who have not fulfilled their responsibilities. In the dispatch room, the on-duty director, work section leader, and shift leader, who have completed a day's work, also gather together to summarize the production achievements of these eight hours, point out which link has not cooperated well, and which link has hindered the implementation of the operation plan. Because the plan specifies the details and the responsibilities are clearly defined, there has never been any buck-passing at this meeting. If the rolling mill idles for a few minutes, which minute is the responsibility of the gas team and which minute is the responsibility of the rolling team, everyone frankly admits their dereliction of duty.

Industrial production is centralized and must have centralized leadership. However, relying on the factory director alone cannot achieve this centralized leadership. He must realize this leadership through certain management institutions and systems. Plan management is the basic method of scientifically managing production and realizing this centralized leadership. Mastering this management method, the leader of an enterprise truly takes the initiative. The factory director and deputy factory director of the medium-sized mill said that they have indeed been "liberated" since the plan management was improved. Every day, after going to work, they look at the charts, and then inspect each work section for a week to solve the problems that are checked out. The rest of the time can be used entirely to consider and solve some more important, fundamental problems. For example, the deputy factory director who is specifically responsible for technical leadership had almost no time to do technical work in the past. Now he can focus his main energy on organizing technical reforms and regular technical education.

Of course, the plan management of the medium-sized mill has only just gotten on the right track, and there are still many incomplete aspects: some people and some parts have not been organized into the operation plan; the content of the operation plan only focuses on output, and has not been able to become a comprehensive action plan that strictly controls output, quality, and cost in all aspects; the question of how to better master the operation plan by the masses remains to be further resolved; in particular, some of the superior conditions provided by plan management have not been consciously and fully utilized by leading cadres. Scientific management systems provide good conditions for managing enterprise production well, but it does not mean that everything will be fine with these systems. Similarly, if production is organized in an orderly manner, a factory can move forward calmly and slowly, or it can leap forward in great strides. Otherwise, scientific management systems can replace everything, and leadership becomes unnecessary.

    科学地管理生产
    ——鞍钢中型轧钢厂计划管理经验概述
    何卓
    中型轧钢厂是鞍钢整个链条里的一个环节，虽然它并不是最复杂的一个，但是要管好它，却不容易。
    全国有八百多个单位向它订货，要求的规格有八十多种；它的原料——钢坯，是由炼钢厂炼成，由初轧厂轧好，由运输部的火车运来的；轧钢机上的轧滚是由机械总厂制造的；工厂本身又是由五个不同的工段组成。内部、外部的联系错综复杂，任何一个因素发生变化，任何一个环节失调，都会影响甚至打乱生产的步调。但中型厂已能够把这些安排得很妥贴：每隔几秒钟，就有一根通红的钢坯从加热炉口滚出来，顺着滚道滑进轧钢机，在轧滚的牙齿——轧槽里窜过来，又窜过去，变成了一条条的钢材。轧钢机旁，竖着一块大黑板，这八小时要轧多少根什么样的钢材，每个小时各要轧多少根，在哪个小时里哪架轧钢机要换轧滚，应该换多少分钟，执行的结果怎么样，在黑板上都写得清清楚楚，工人随时都可以从这儿知道自己应该作些什么，是不是完成了这一个小时的国家计划。每个月要轧哪些种钢材，它的次序是怎样排列的，什么时候检修机器，什么时候要准备好新的轧滚，每个班、组的基层干部在上一个月的月末就都知道了。每天，执行计划当中遇到什么波折，电话立刻从车间打到工厂的生产指挥部——调度室，本厂能解决的，马上由值班主任下命令解决了。现在，在这个工厂里，各个工段吵嘴、扯皮，互相埋怨对方不好好配合，或是缺几吨原料、少一个轧滚都来找厂长，生产计划能不能完成心里没有底，成天耽心害怕，不知道什么时候生产又会“卡壳”……，诸如此类的事情，不再发生了。今年第一季度十二个星期中有九个星期它都均衡地完成了计划。
    所以能够做到这样，是因为它抓住了管理生产的基本方法——计划管理，也抓住了实现计划管理的中心环节——作业计划，并且用几张图表把作业计划形象地表现出来，只要看看图表，这个月、这一周、这一天要做什么、做多少、什么时候做、用什么做、由谁做、做的结果怎样，都一目了然。有节奏的、均衡的生产，就是靠这种科学的管理方法来实现的。
    光看图表，项目不多，只有一些日期、品种的符号、数目字和几条红蓝线，但是，能够在上个月末就把这些蓝色的线条——作业计划线——画好，也并不是轻而易举的。自然，如果仅仅想编制一个粗糙的、比较低级的作业计划，只要根据国家计划、订货合同、再加上主要设备的检修计划，把一个月的计划产量以三十天均摊一下就行。但，如想编出一个真正有指示性的作业计划，就还必须考虑更多的因素和做更周密的计算。譬如，每个加热炉每小时能加热多少钢坯，轧钢机每小时能轧多少钢材，吊车每小时能装卸多少……，这些设备的能力、定额，中型厂在编制作业计划的时候，都有由日常操作记录积累起来的资料作根据。各种原料、工具、运输、水、电、煤气……，是不是平衡，各种消耗定额是多少，各种产品的操作方法和生产条件有哪些不同，上个月生产任务完成的情况怎样，这个月是否要有所增加或弥补，这些，中型厂在制订作业计划的时候，也都要认真考虑或根据记录资料来计算。
    这样，并不是说制订作业计划只是单纯技术性的计算和编排；以什么态度来对待这些条件和根据，是消极地完成任务，还是通过作业计划来指导生产，这中间的差别很大。中型厂是遵循着下面这些思想原则来编制作业计划的。
    编制作业计划，必须有强烈的国家观念、整体观念。工厂计划是国家计划的一个组成部分，小计划一定要服从大计划。去年下半年，中型厂还有过这样的事：愿意多轧好轧的品种，有时候已经轧够了订货数量也不愿立刻换品种，继续轧到下班或是每个轧槽都磨秃了的时候才停。这样，从数量上看，本厂是超产了，但国家的物资平衡计划却可能被破坏，急需要的钢材没轧出来，目前用不着的却积压了。现在，他们已经纠正了这种做法。完全按照订货要求来生产，已经成了编制计划时必须遵守的首要法规；并不顾及这样做有时会感到很不方便，像换滚时间即使赶到晚上，修理工人不该上班，也坚决按规定时间换；轧滚上的轧槽还没完全磨秃，也坚决撤下来；有时来了重要的紧急订货，宁肯突击进行准备工作，也要把它排在计划的最前边。他们已经认识到：自己按期完成了订货计划，就给兄弟工厂创造了按期均衡完成计划的条件，这样才对整个国家计划的完成尽了自己的责任。
    编制作业计划，必须善于寻找和运用平均先进定额，这样的计划才能具有把生产推向前进的指导作用。去年十月中旬轧扁钢的时候，甲班工人李尚林研究成功了一个“铁簸箕”，创出一班轧一千四百七十三根的新纪录。这时候，生产科便把定额从原来的一班一千一百根提到一千五百根，比最高纪录还多二十七根。看起来，似乎有些冒进；但生产科向工人详细说明了理由，工人们却感到达到新定额完全有把握。原来，创造新纪录这一班各个小时的产量并不一样：第一小时刚上班，轧了九十六根，第二小时轧一百九十四根，第三小时一百九十五根，第四小时二百二十根，第五小时因为换锯片，降到一百五十三根，第六小时上升到二百二十四根，第七小时因为出了个小故障，又降到一百七十五根，最后一小时又上升到二百十三根。这八小时产量的平均数是每小时轧一百八十四根，把超过这个平均数的第二、三、四、六、八这五个小时的产量加起来用五除，得出的平均先进定额是每小时二百零九点五根。而生产科在规定新定额的时候，为了慎重，还只是按照每小时二百根计算的，而第一小时又只算了一百根。超过新纪录但又不冒进的新定额，就是这样订出来的。正因为他们对每时每刻的生产活动都做记录、统计、并且加以分析和运用，所以能够找出新的平均先进定额来充实作业计划。正如鞍钢副经理刘克刚同志所说：“实现计划管理主要靠作业计划；作业计划是否先进要看定额，定额则应建立在准确的原始记录的基础上；有了科学的、先进的定额，才会有先进的、切实可行的作业计划。”
    作业计划必须全面。生产不是孤立的，作业计划不能只规定直接生产部门的行动，一切围绕着生产的辅助部门和其他不可缺少的工作都得组织在作业计划之内；在这些方面考虑得越周密，作业计划的准确性就越大。中型厂现在的作业计划里，除了产量之外，还有原料（钢坯）供应计划、消耗材料
    （煤炭、柏油、黄干油、……）准备计划、轧滚、矫直滚、导卫板等工具设备的准备计划、轧槽使用计划，这些计划都是根据直接生产部分的需要制订的。只有这样全面地筹划，作业计划才不致是一纸空文。
    编制作业计划，必须注意寻找和发挥机械设备的潜在力量。有些设备的能力，在表面上看来是不平衡的，但如果作业计划编排得好，这种不平衡就可相对地缩小甚至消除。譬如，轻轨轧完要用矫直机弄直，但中型厂矫直机的能力只及轧钢机的三分之二，而轧大方钢、圆钢，又根本不用矫直机。如果，在一个月里把所有的轻轨都集中在一个时期生产，半成品就会在矫直机旁积压起来；如果在一个时期中集中生产大方钢和圆钢，矫直机又会“失业”。因此，他们在编制作业计划时，总是把需要矫直的和不需要矫直的品种搭配开，使得矫直机能够均衡地运用，订货也能够均衡地完成。
    编制作业计划，必须发挥主观能动性，克服那些看来好像是客观原因所造成的无法克服的困难。今年以前，中型厂积压车皮在全公司是出名的，今年第一季度，运输部又实行了“定时定量运行图表制”，限定三十分钟必须把车卸完。这下可给中型厂出了难题：要保证原料均衡地运来，必须协助运输部实现这个改革；但原料班只有两台吊车，又要从火车上往下卸钢坯，又要往加热炉里送钢坯，原已感到不够用。但是，他们仍尽力想办法从内部解决，最后决心把修理工段的吊车也拨到原料班来，又改革了运转工人的工资制度，结果做到了二十分钟就卸完一辆车，给全公司实现计划运输造成了好条件。
    尽管月的作业计划是经过这样周密的考虑和计算制订出来的，但它仍不可能预计到生产中的一切变化。只有月计划，还不能准确地、具体地指导每一天的生产活动。中型厂每周、每天还制订一周的和每一班——八小时的作业计划。这样，才有条件随时掌握生产当中发生的各种变化，主动地控制它们，不许它们阻碍生产。这三个计划，一个比一个具体，一个比一个准确，一个保证着一个，哪一个也不能缺少。
    前面所讲的各种指示图表上的蓝线，就是这些作业计划的形象化——它用几根简单的线条，代表了许多复杂的文字。在图表上，和蓝线并行的、每天延长着的红线，则揭示了作业计划每天的实践结果。红线和蓝线一对照，就看出了生产中的一切变化和执行计划中的波折，就预见到了为实现作业计划在下一天、下一周所必须解决的问题，就可以发现先进的、新鲜事物的萌芽，和落后的、薄弱的环节，就掌握了整个工厂这一天的全部生产活动。先进的、周密的、准确的、具体的作业计划和指示图表一结合，就变成了指导生产的得力工具。
    但是，从蓝线变成红线，是全厂千百个职工实践的结果。有了作业计划，并不等于就实现了作业计划；各个环节都按照计划进行生产，并不等于不需要统一的指挥；尽管作业计划编制得多么周密，也并不等于在生产实践中就不再发生任何变化。因此，必须有一个集中的、强有力的机构来指挥、监督、检查作业计划的执行。这个机构就是调度室。在中型厂生产科办公室的一角，桌上安着三台电话，墙上挂着几张图表，无论昼夜，每时每刻都有一个人坐在这里，调节着每个环节之间的不平衡，解决着执行计划过程中发生的一切矛盾。这个人就是协助厂长指挥生产的调度员。每隔八小时，在换班的工人到厂之前半小时，下一班的值班调度员就已站在指示图前面，了解上一班的生产情况，看上一班已经轧了多少，还有几个轧槽没有用完，得什么时候换轧滚，换哪几架，根据这些，立即把下一班的作业计划排出来，交给值班主任，布置给各个班、组长。工人一上班，就按着这个计划干起来。这时候，调度员又按照指示图表所提示的，指挥各个环节的活动，检查、提醒各种准备工作。譬如，这种产品快轧完了，就根据成品率计算一下还需要加热多少钢坯，赶快通知原料班，并且告诉他们接着要装哪一种钢坯；同时通知轧钢班，轧到哪一号钢坯的时候就改换轧滚；如果这种钢材还要轧很久，就要检查一下钢坯的储备量是不是够用，如果不够，就得向公司的总调度室提出。正因为它是指挥全厂生产活动的神经中枢，所以生产中的一切矛盾也都即刻反映、集中到这个地方；而调度员也就必须随时解决这些矛盾，不让它阻碍作业计划的实现。有一次，轧轻轨的时候，原来计划五个班用五个轧槽就够了，但是因为没有把轧滚的质量估计得准确，第一个班就把五个轧槽都用完了，这个突然的变化恰恰发生在晚上，值班调度员立即下决心，派人把轧滚班的工人从家里找来，连夜把新的轧滚车好，使生产没有中断。又有一次夜晚，值班调度员突然发现一向被认为不会出问题的煤炭就要烧完了，发生炉的煤气不到天亮就得断绝，全厂的生产都得停止。这时，调度员便立即向运输部和公司总调度室求援，半夜要来了一车煤，第二天又用汽车赶运了一天，才解除了这个威胁。这就是调度的工作和调度的作用。中型厂的职工都说：工厂没有调度不行。
    集中的指挥需要有严密组织的队伍，工厂的调度工作要求着严格的责任制度。在中型厂，和鞍钢的其他工厂一样，每一班代行厂长职务，运用调度来指挥全厂生产的，是值班主任。在这八小时里，他对按作业计划完成任务，保证产品质量，保证生产安全，保证上级一切指令的贯彻，负完全责任。同样，在一个工段的范围里，由值班工段长负完全责任；在一个班、一个组，由班长、组长负全责。每一台机器的操作，每一节水管的维护、检修，每个炉子的温度高低，每一根成品的质量好坏，都有人负责。在中型厂，凡是没有按照作业计划执行的，一律叫做事故，而每一件事故都能查明谁是责任者。有了这一系列的专责制：班组长以上干部的行政专责制、工人当中的岗位责任制、以及质量责任制、检修责任制……，作业计划和调度命令才能贯彻，“计划就是法律”，才具有了实际的意义。
    这种责任制度是建立在民主管理的基础上的，计划必须为群众所掌握才会变成力量。在中型厂，布置每班作业计划的时候，都要召开一次班、组长会议，告诉大家这个计划是根据什么编排的，使得人们在接受命令的时候，知道这是为了什么。而当他们觉得这个命令有不完备、不切合实际的地方时，领导方面会考虑他们的建议，以至采纳他们的正确意见，撤回旧命令，发布新的指示。每个人是不是尽到了他所负的责任，又有集体来监督、检查，工人每次下班都要开一次小会，检讨哪个小时为什么没有完成任务，研究没有完成的原因，批评没有尽到责任的人，在调度室，已经做完了一天工作的值班主任、工段长和班长，也同样聚集在一起，总结这八小时的生产成绩，指出哪个环节没有配合好，哪一个环节阻碍了作业计划的执行。因为计划上规定得具体，责任划分得明确，这个会上从来没有扯皮的事情，轧钢机空转了几分钟，哪分钟是煤气班的责任，哪分钟是轧钢班的责任，大家都是痛痛快快地承认自己的失责。
    工业生产是集中的，必须有集中的领导。但是，单靠厂长一个人，是不能实现这种集中领导的，他必须通过一定的管理机构和制度来实现这种领导。而计划管理就是科学地管理生产，实现这种集中领导的基本方法。掌握了这样的管理方法，一个企业的领导者就真正取得了主动。中型厂的厂长和副厂长说，自从健全了计划管理以来，他们的确是被“解放”了。每天一上班，看一看图表，然后到各个工段巡视一周，解决一下检查出来的问题。其余的时间就可以全部用来考虑解决一些比较重大的、带根本性质的问题。譬如，专门负责技术领导的副厂长，过去几乎完全没有时间做技术方面的工作，现在他却可以把主要精力放在组织技术改革和经常的技术教育上面了。
    当然，中型厂的计划管理还只刚刚走上正轨，还有很多不完备的地方：有一些人和一些部分还没有组织到作业计划中来；作业计划的内容只着重在产量方面，还没有能成为严格控制产量、质量、成本各个方面的全面的行动计划；作业计划如何更好地为群众所掌握的问题，还待进一步解决；特别是计划管理所提供的一些优越条件，还没有被领导干部自觉地、充分地运用。科学的管理制度给管好企业生产提供了良好的条件，但是，并不是有了这些制度就万事大吉了。同样是把生产组织得有条有理，但一个工厂也可以平静地、缓慢地前进，也可以大踏步地跃进。不然，科学的管理制度就可以代替一切，领导就成为不需要的了。
