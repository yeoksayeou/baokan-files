Xinhua News Agency, June 26th: Indonesian and Pakistani public opinion has consistently condemned Syngman Rhee's provocative actions aimed at undermining the armistice, and believes that the US government should bear the responsibility for this destruction of peace.

    The "Great Indonesia" newspaper published an editorial on the 20th, accusing Syngman Rhee's destructive actions of threatening the Korean armistice. The newspaper believes it is hard to believe that the American side was unaware of or did not prevent the easy release of tens of thousands of prisoners of war. The newspaper suspects that some people within the US government want to continue profiting from the war.

    The Indonesian-language "Newspaper" published an editorial on the 19th entitled "Destroying Peace," stating: "North Korea made an agreement with the United Nations forces regarding the repatriation of prisoners of war, therefore, whichever part of the United Nations forces violates this agreement, it is equivalent to the United Nations forces doing it, and the United Nations should bear the responsibility for this destruction of peace."

    The "Indonesian News" commented: "From Syngman Rhee's peace-destroying actions, it is not difficult to see that this 'Dr. Rhee' has always had the desire to attack North Korea to unify Korea. It is now very clear who the aggressor who started the Korean War is. Without a doubt, Syngman Rhee is the culprit."

    Pakistan's "Dawn" newspaper published an editorial on the 23rd, stating: "Syngman Rhee, after dealing a fatal blow to the ceasefire negotiations, has become even more rampant," and "the foundation of Korean peace, painstakingly achieved over two years, has been damaged." The newspaper believes that "only more decisive steps can save the United Nations from its predicament. The desire for peace should be stronger than the madness and ignorance of a conceited leader."

    The "Pakistan Times" said on the 20th: "Syngman Rhee has criminally violated the prisoner of war agreement," and "it is impossible for the United Nations to have been completely unaware of this from the beginning."

    According to Xinhua News Agency: Newspapers in many Western European countries have criticized Syngman Rhee's actions to undermine the Korean armistice.

    The British Labour Party newspaper "Daily Herald" commented that Syngman Rhee "is not satisfied with endangering the armistice negotiations by releasing prisoners of war; he has also issued statements about his so-called 'conditions' and threatening remarks." "As for Syngman Rhee's so-called conditions, they would completely undermine the basis of the agreement reached in the armistice negotiations, and of course, that is the purpose of his proposing these conditions." The newspaper said: "As Sir Winston Churchill said, this arrogant and 'treacherous' action raises a simple but very important question for us. Who is responsible for controlling South Korea? The United Nations or Syngman Rhee?"

    The West German "Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung" said: Syngman Rhee's purpose is, in any case, obvious, which is to undermine the armistice. The newspaper believes that Washington should not allow the armistice to be undermined, and the US military authorities must use its troops to stop South Korean resistance. The "Bonn General Guide" said: Syngman Rhee's actions endanger the peace that the world is impatiently awaiting.

    French newspapers unanimously condemned Syngman Rhee's sabotage of the armistice. "Le Monde" said: Syngman Rhee has made all the attempts made over the past eighteen months to obtain a mutually agreed agreement on the prisoner of war issue equal to zero, which cannot but cause the Chinese and North Korean sides to have major doubts about the sincerity of the United Nations Command. "L'Aurore" said: Syngman Rhee's various actions should obviously be the responsibility of the United Nations Command.

    The Swiss "Tribune de Genève" said: The crisis caused by Syngman Rhee is very likely to delay the conclusion of the armistice agreement, and the Washington government and the US military authorities in Tokyo are equally responsible for this crisis.

    Danish newspapers have also expressed indignation at Syngman Rhee's destructive behavior.

    印尼、巴基斯坦和西欧许多国家的舆论
    指责李承晚阻挠朝鲜停战的破坏行动
    【新华社二十六日讯】日来印尼和巴基斯坦舆论一致指责李承晚企图破坏停战的挑衅行动，并认为美国政府应担负这一破坏和平的责任。
    “大印度尼西亚报”二十日发表社论，指责李承晚的破坏行动已使朝鲜停战受到威胁。该报认为对数万战俘的被轻易释放，美国方面竟毫无所知，也不加制止，是很难令人相信的。该报怀疑美国政府方面有人想继续在战争中获利。
    印尼文“新报”十九日以“破坏和平”为题发表社论称：“北朝鲜是和联合国军订立关于遣返战俘协定的，因此不管联合国军方面那一部分的军队破坏了这个协定，就等于联合国军干出来的，理应由联合国负起这破坏和平的责任。”
       “印尼新闻报”评论说：“从李承晚这个破坏和平的行动来看，不难发现这位‘李博士’一向有着进攻北朝鲜以统一朝鲜的欲望。谁是发动朝鲜战争的侵略者，现在已很明白。毫无疑问，李承晚就是祸首。”
    巴基斯坦“黎明报”二十三日发表社论称：“李承晚在给停火谈判以致命打击后，已变得更加猖獗”，“两年来辛苦达成的朝鲜和平基础已被损害”。该报认为：“只有更坚决的步骤，才能将联合国从窘境挽回。和平愿望应比一个狂妄的领袖的疯狂愚昧更强有力些。”
    “巴基斯坦时报”二十日说：“李承晚罪恶地违反了战俘协议”，“联合国自始至终对此一无所知是不可能的”。
    据新华社讯：许多西欧国家的报纸斥责李承晚破坏朝鲜停战的行为。
    英国工党报纸“每日先驱报”评论说：李承晚“不以借释放战俘危害停战谈判为满足，他还发表了关于他的所谓‘条件’的声明和威胁性的谈话。”“至于李承晚的所谓条件，那只会完全破坏在停战谈判中所达成的协议的基础，而当然，这正是他提出这些条件的目的”。该报说：“正如温斯顿·邱吉尔爵士所说的，这种蛮横与‘背信弃义’的行动给我们提出了简单而十分重要的问题。谁负责控制南朝鲜？联合国还是李承晚？”
    西德“法兰克福公众报”说：李承晚的目的无论如何是明显的，就是在于破坏停战。该报认为，华盛顿方面不应允许破坏停战，美军当局必须使用它的军队制止南朝鲜的反抗。“波恩总指南报”说：李承晚的行为危害了全世界不耐烦地期待着的和平。
    法国报纸一致谴责李承晚破坏停战。“世界报”说：李承晚使十八个月来在战俘问题上为了获得一个双方同意的协议所进行的一切尝试都等于零，这不能不使朝中方面对联合国军司令部的诚意产生重大怀疑。“震旦报”说：李承晚的各种行动，显然应由联合国军司令部负责。
    瑞士“日内瓦论坛报”说：李承晚所造成的危机非常可能拖延停战协定的缔结，华盛顿政府和东京美军当局对这个危机同样是要负责的。
    丹麦报纸对李承晚的破坏行为，也都表示愤慨。
