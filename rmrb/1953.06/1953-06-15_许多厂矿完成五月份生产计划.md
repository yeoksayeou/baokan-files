Xinhua News Agency Report: Many state-owned and local state-owned factories and mines across the country strengthened their planning management and launched labor competitions in May, completing or exceeding their production plans.

In May, through mass revisions of plans, many factories across the country have gradually strengthened their planning management. In Shenyang, 22 major state-owned and local state-owned factories, including metallurgical plants, comprehensively exceeded the state production plan for May and solved many key problems in strengthening planning management. For example, Mechanical Factory No. 12 found that the key problem hindering balanced production was the high rate of defective castings in the sand casting workshop. They actively promoted the "leaky mold method," reducing the defect rate from 30% to about 10%.

The various workshops under the Benxi Iron and Steel Company strengthened their planning management work in May. For example, the workers in the blast furnace workshop discussed technical norms and clarified their goals. The on-duty technicians formulated a guarantee plan to control the operating conditions inside the furnace, and the furnace workers also actively improved their operating methods. As a result, the blast furnace workshop not only completed the production plan for May but also did not have a single accident in mechanical operation. In Dalian and Lushun, 17 important state-owned and local state-owned factories completed or exceeded their production plans in May due to improved production management. The main reason why these factories were able to complete their plans was that they continuously improved their production management. For example, Machine Factory No. 21 has completed its production plan on schedule every month for 17 consecutive months since January of last year. Although the production task in May this year was 20% higher than the highest monthly output in the past, the plan was still completed on schedule. The factory’s total output value in May exceeded the plan by 3.5%, labor productivity increased by 4.5% compared to the plan, and the total value of goods exceeded the plan by 0.2%. On the basis of continuing to carry out labor competitions, the Second Glass Factory promoted the advanced experience of "organizing rhythmic production according to instruction charts," enabling all six major workshops and 69 production teams to complete their plans evenly according to the daily schedule. Therefore, the entire factory completed the state production plan for May three days ahead of schedule, exceeding it by 0.58%. In May, the Dalian Alkali Plant paid attention to safe production, with a total output value of 101.36%, the main product, soda ash, completing 110.86%, and caustic soda completing 121.03%.

The state-owned Fushun Mining Bureau and the Fushun No. 1 Petroleum Factory, the Electrical Porcelain Factory, the power supply system of the power plant, and the cement plant have all completed the state production plan for May. The No. 1 Petroleum Factory launched a competition to "complete the daily schedule plan" and organized forces to strengthen the leadership of weak links, so that the balanced production rate, the equipment utilization rate of some crude oil workshops, the oil yield of oil shale, and the daily crude oil production were all improved compared with April. After in-depth investigation and research, the leaders of the Harbin State-owned Electrical Engineering Factory No. 4 found that the main key affecting the completion of the production plan was the low quality of products. Therefore, they concentrated their efforts and mobilized workers to discuss and formulate operating procedures, quality standards for parts and components, and quality inspection systems. They also established an instruction chart system for the processing of components and the supply of materials. These measures provided a reliable guarantee for completing and exceeding the state production plan.

In the competition campaign, the Beijing North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory, in addition to improving the operation plan and scheduling system, also mobilized workers to carry out a major quality inspection, summarized the experience of worker Yang Zhuqing in eliminating defective products and promoted it, so that all defective plow brackets in the assembly workshop were eliminated. In May, the entire factory overproduced 789 walking plows and completed the plan for producing rocker reapers and weeding hoes two days ahead of schedule.

In the May labor competition, the output and quality of yarn and cloth in the Shanghai No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory exceeded the plan. The yarn breakage rate was 6.3% lower than the original plan and 13% lower than in April. The rate of first-class cloth for gabardine and venetian was above 99%. In the May competition, the leadership of the Shanghai No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory strengthened technical management by various means. They specially trained a group of experienced loom operators to participate in technical measurement work; technicians, workshop cadres, and veteran workers also formed a breakage rate research team to specifically study the specific causes of breakage and ways to reduce breakage based on the measurement results; cadres and worker representatives from the factory's Party organization, trade union, and Communist Youth League also formed an inspection team to inspect and supervise the implementation of various technical measures. Therefore, the unexplained breakage phenomenon in the second half of May was significantly reduced compared to the first half of the month, and the workers had more confidence in reducing the breakage rate. Around reducing the breakage rate, the workers' enthusiasm for learning advanced operating methods was also higher. For example, the fine yarn workers conducted a special review of the Hao Jianxiu work method, and many temporary workers also learned the advanced operating method. In May, the breakage caused by poor operation of 42-count yarn was reduced to only 6.84% of the total breakage, which was 40% lower than planned. Fourteen state-owned, local state-owned, and joint state-private factories in Nanjing completed or exceeded the state production plan for May. Among them, the Nanjing Electrical Porcelain Factory completed the second quarter plan one month ahead of schedule.

The Zhongliangshan Coalfield drilling site of the Southwest Geological Bureau of the Ministry of Geology of the Central People's Government launched a labor competition in May centered on learning advanced experience, strictly abiding by operating procedures, and establishing a dedicated responsibility system. The site exceeded the drilling plan by 20%; the core recovery rate reached 80%. Twenty-six major state-owned and local state-owned factories and mines in Chongqing completed or exceeded the May production plan. These major factories and mines universally and thoroughly mobilized workers to discuss the national production plan in May. Some factory and mine workers formulated team or individual operation plans when discussing the plan; some factory and mine workers also started with the shortcomings of the past in implementing the plan and found the key to improving output and quality in the discussion of the plan. After the various factories and mines under the state-owned Yunnan Tin Corporation mobilized the workers to discuss the production plan, they exceeded the May production plan, with refined tin completing 101.43% and solder completing 161.89%.

The employees of the Guangzhou Electric Power Bureau Power Plant exceeded the May production plan and successfully completed the safe production competition with fraternal power plants in the Central and Southern District, realizing the competition condition of making May a "safe and accident-free month." Five state-owned factories in Changsha completed or exceeded the May production plan in May. These factories mobilized the workers to discuss the annual and May production plans in May, and initially tapped the production potential. Among them, the Shuikoushan Mining Bureau's No. 1 Zinc Smelting Plant and Jiangling 0324 Factory, and four other factories launched a labor competition on the basis of mobilizing the workers to discuss the plan.

    许多厂矿完成五月份生产计划
    据新华社讯：各地许多国营和地方国营工厂、矿山，在五月份加强计划管理，开展劳动竞赛，完成或超额完成了生产计划。
    五月份，各地经过群众性的修订计划，不少工厂已逐步加强了计划管理。沈阳市有冶炼厂等二十二个主要的国营和地方国营工厂全面地超额完成了五月份国家生产计划，并解决了加强计划管理的许多关键问题。如机械十二厂找到阻碍均衡生产的关键问题是翻砂车间的铸件废品多，他们就积极推广“漏模法”，使废品率由百分之三十降低到百分之十左右。
    本溪钢铁公司所属的各个车间在五月份都加强了计划管理工作。如高炉车间职工讨论了技术定额，明确规定了努力目标。值班技术员订出掌握炉内操作情况的保证计划，炉前工人也积极改进操作方法。因而，高炉车间五月份不仅完成了生产计划，而且在机械运转方面没有发生一次事故。旅大市十七个重要的国营和地方国营工厂，在五月份由于改进了生产管理，都完成或提前完成了生产计划。这些工厂能够完成计划，主要是因为不断地改善了生产管理。例如机器二十一厂从去年一月以来，连续十七个月，月月按期完成生产计划。今年五月份的生产任务虽比过去最高月产量还高百分之二十，但仍按期完成了计划。这个工厂五月份完成生产总值超过计划百分之三点五，劳动生产率比计划提高了百分之四点五，商品总值也超过计划百分之零点二。第二玻璃工厂在继续开展劳动竞赛的基础上，推广“按指示图表组织有节奏生产”的先进经验，使全厂六个主要车间和六十九个生产小组，都按日进度均衡地完成了计划，因此，全厂提前三天超额百分之零点五八完成了五月份国家生产计划。大连碱厂在五月份注意了安全生产，生产总值完成了百分之一百零一点三六，主要产品纯碱完成了百分之一百一十点八六、火碱完成了百分之一百二十一点零三。
    国营抚顺矿务局和抚顺市石油一厂、电瓷厂、发电厂的供电系统、水泥厂等都已完成了五月份的国家生产计划。石油一厂展开了“完成日进度计划”的竞赛，并组织力量加强了对薄弱环节的领导，使均衡生产率、部分原油车间的设备利用率、油母页岩的出油率、原油日产量等都比四月份提高。哈尔滨国营电工四厂的领导方面经过深入调查研究，发现影响完成生产计划的主要关键是产品质量低劣，于是他们就集中力量，发动职工讨论和制订了工序操作规程、零件部件质量标准和质量检查制度；对部件加工和材料的供应方面，也建立了指示图表制。这些措施，都为完成和超额完成国家生产计划提供了可靠的保证。
    北京华北农业机械总厂在竞赛运动中除改进了作业计划与调度制度外，并发动职工开展质量大检查，总结工人杨柱清消灭废品的经验加以推广，使装配车间犁托打眼废品全部消灭。五月份全厂超额生产步犁七百八十九部，并提前两天完成了生产摇臂收割机和耘锄的计划。
    上海第二棉纺织厂在五月劳动竞赛中，纱、布的产量和质量都超额完成计划，纱的断头率比原计划降低百分之六点三，比四月份降低百分之十三。哔叽和直贡呢的正布率都在百分之九十九以上。在五月竞赛中，上海第二棉纺织厂的领导方面用各种办法加强了技术管理。他们专门训练了一批有技术经验的挡车工参加技术测定工作；技术人员、车间干部和老工人也组成断头率研究小组，根据测定结果专门研究造成断头的具体原因和减少断头的办法；厂里中共组织、工会和青年团的干部和工人代表也组成检查组，检查督促各种技术措施的执行情况。因此，五月下半月的原因不明的断头现象就比上半月显著减少，职工们对降低断头率就更有了把握。围绕着降低断头率，工人们学习先进操作法的热情也更高了。如细纱工特别进行了一次郝建秀工作法补课，许多临时工也学会了先进操作法。五月份四十二支纱因操作不良而造成的断头减少到只占全部断头的百分之六点八四，比计划降低了百分之四十。南京市有十四个国营、地方国营和公私合营的工厂完成或超额完成了五月份国家生产计划。其中南京电瓷厂提前一个月完成了第二季度计划。
    中央人民政府地质部西南地质局中梁山煤田钻探工地，在五月份展开了以学习先进经验、严格遵守操作规程和建立专责制度为中心的劳动竞赛。该工地超额百分之二十完成了钻探计划；岩芯取得率达到百分之八十。重庆市有二十六个主要的国营和地方国营工厂、矿山完成或超额完成了五月份生产计划。这些主要厂矿在五月份普遍深入地发动职工讨论了国家生产计划。有些厂矿的职工在讨论计划时，订出了小组或个人的作业计划；有些厂矿在讨论计划中，还从过去执行计划的缺点入手，找出了提高产量与质量的关键。国营云南锡业公司所属各厂矿发动职工讨论生产计划后，超额完成了五月份生产计划，其中精锡完成百分之一零一点四三，焊锡完成百分之一六一点八九。
    广州电业局发电厂的职工超额完成了五月份的生产计划，并胜利完成了和中南区兄弟电厂开展安全生产竞赛，实现了五月为“安全无事故月”的竞赛条件。长沙市有五个国营工厂在五月份完成或超额完成了五月份的生产计划。这些厂五月份都发动职工讨论了全年及五月份的生产计划，初步挖掘了生产潜力。其中水口山矿务局第一炼锌厂和江零三二四工厂等四厂，并在发动职工讨论计划的基础上开展了劳动竞赛。
