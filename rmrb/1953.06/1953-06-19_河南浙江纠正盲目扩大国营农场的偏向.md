Henan, Zhejiang Correct Tendency of Blindly Expanding State-Owned Farms

[This newspaper dispatch] Some local state-owned farms in some special districts and counties of some provinces and regions have been greedy for more and rushed forward, blindly expanding, competing with the people for land, causing dissatisfaction and unease among the farmers near the farms, hindering the establishment of the close relationship that should exist between the farms and the masses of farmers, and directly hindering current production. In the spring of this year, the Xia County Farm in Henan Province sent twelve cadres to various townships to publicize in a big way that the farm would adjust land with the farmers. The land they wanted to adjust involved five districts and more than two thousand peasant households. The land that the Luoyang Special District Farm wanted to adjust involved fourteen townships. This caused dissatisfaction and opposition from the local people. The Nanyang Special District Farm forced farmers to adjust land and forced the masses to exchange houses. After the Weishi County Farm blindly expanded its cultivated land area, it had more than 2,000 mu of land that it could not manage. In March and April of this year, the Yiwu County Farm in Zhejiang Province "transferred" more than 129 mu of "flexible land" reserved during the land reform from the surrounding villages into the farm, and exchanged cultivated land with farmers near the farm. This matter involved eight townships, twenty-five villages, and one hundred and ninety-five peasant households; the land with changed land rights involved three hundred and twenty mu of paddy fields and fifty mu of dry land. Zong Zhaogui, a farmer in Maodian Village, had more than one mu of good land near the village, which was exchanged for lake pond land more than two li away from his home; Lou Zongyao, a farmer, had a piece of land with very good soil quality that could harvest 800 jin of rice, but was exchanged for two pieces of land with poor soil quality that could only harvest 600 jin of rice. The farmers who had already had their land adjusted said helplessly, "Just consider that we didn't get land during the land reform!" The farmers near the farm who had not had their land adjusted were not enthusiastic about production because they were afraid of land adjustment, and did not apply fertilizer, waiting for land exchange. Some families, fearing that the trees would be taken away during the land adjustment, cut down the trees on the field ridges. Therefore, the local farmers and the farm were opposed to each other, and they were unwilling to go to the farm or help the farm with work. These farms expanded the area of cultivated land not truly out of the actual need for increasing production demonstrations; they did not and could not fully and well utilize the blindly expanded land. More than 80% of the rice seedlings of the Yiwu County Farm rotted this year. The farmers sarcastically said: "The farm has good experience - rotten seedlings."

The leading organs of Henan Province and Zhejiang Province have begun to pay attention to correcting the above situation. The Henan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party issued instructions to its local committees and county committees in late April, asking them to help the cadres of the farms in various special districts and counties to ideologically recognize the seriousness of the mistake of blindly expanding farms, immediately stop expanding the area of farmland, concentrate their efforts on operating existing farms well, improve agricultural technology, and strengthen operation and management; and, where possible, directly provide agricultural production cooperatives, mutual aid groups, and individual farmers with technical demonstrations and assistance. All contracts for adjusting land that have been signed with farmers but have not yet been adjusted should be immediately explained to the masses and the contracts should be revoked; if land has already been exchanged, and the masses are dissatisfied and request the return of the land, the masses' original land should be immediately returned to the masses, and a self-criticism should be made to the masses; if any farmers have suffered losses due to the land exchange, they should be compensated at the original price. The Jinhua Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Zhejiang Province has sent special personnel to the Yiwu Farm to inspect and deal with these issues.

    河南浙江纠正盲目扩大国营农场的偏向
    【本报讯】有些省区部分专区、县的地方国营农场，贪多冒进，盲目扩大，与民争地，引起农场附近农民的不满和不安，妨碍了农场和农民群众之间应有的密切关系的建立，并且直接妨碍了当前的生产。河南省夏邑县农场在今年春季曾派了十二名干部，到各乡大张旗鼓地宣传农场要和农民调整土地。他们要调整的土地，涉及五个区，两千多户农民。洛阳专区农场要调整的土地涉及十四个乡。这种事情引起了当地群众的不满和反对。南阳专区农场强迫农民调整土地，并强迫群众换房子。尉氏县农场在盲目扩大了耕地面积以后，有两千多亩田无力经营。浙江省义乌县农场在今年三、四月间，把周围乡村中土地改革时保留的“机动田”“调”入农场一百二十九亩多，并和农场附近的农民调换耕地。这件事涉及八个乡、镇，二十五个村，一百九十五户农民；因此而变动地权的土地有三百二十亩水田，五十亩旱田。毛店村农民宗兆贵靠近村庄的一亩多好田，被调换成离家二里以外的湖塘田；农民楼宗瑶有一块田，土质很好，可收八百斤稻，后被调换为两块田，土质不好，只能收六百斤稻。已经被调了田的农民，无可奈何地说：“就只当土地改革时没分到田吧！”农场附近没有被调田的农民，因怕调田，生产情绪也不高，不施肥料，等待换田。有些人家怕调田时把树也带去，就把田塍上的树砍了。因此，当地农民和农场对立了起来，他们不愿意上农场去，也不愿给农场帮工。这些农场扩大耕地面积，并不是真正从增产示范的实际需要出发的；他们并没有也不可能把盲目扩大的土地充分地很好地利用起来。义乌县农场今年的稻秧就烂了百分之八十以上。农民们讽刺地说：“农场经验好——烂秧。”
    河南省、浙江省的领导机关对于以上情况已开始注意纠正。中共河南省委员会已于四月下旬对所属各地委、县委发出指示，要他们帮助各专区、县农场干部，从思想上认识到盲目扩大农场的错误的严重性，立即停止扩大农场耕地面积，集中力量经营好现有农场，改进农业技术，加强经营管理；并在可能的条件下，直接给农业生产合作社、互助组、单干农民以技术上的示范和援助。凡已和农民订立调整土地合同，但还没有进行调整的，应立即向群众讲明，撤销合同；已经交换土地的，如果群众不满，要求退还土地，应立即把群众原有的土地退还群众，并向群众作检讨；如有农民因换地而遭受损失，应照价赔偿。中共浙江省金华地委已经派出专人到义乌农场检查处理这些问题。
