    The Coal Construction Companies of Yueyang County and Nanchang City
    Should Not Shorten Long Timber When Allocating It

    A letter from Xu Danyu, a timber salesman at the Suzhou Company of the China Coal Industry Building Materials Company: On January 20th of this year, the Yueyang branch of the Coal Construction Company allocated a batch of West Hunan and Guangdong timber to our company. This timber consisted of century-old, high-quality logs, each 20 meters long. However, in order to facilitate loading, they actually sawed these long logs into sections of about 11 meters. The main use of long timber is for water conservancy projects, bridges, shipbuilding, and some larger construction projects. The Yueyang branch, simply to complete the allocation task, actually sawed the country's valuable high-quality timber in half, making it unsuitable for the aforementioned projects. This behavior of destroying national property is intolerable. Our company's price loss after this batch of timber was shortened was over 100 million yuan; other brother companies also received a lot of similar timber. It is worth noting that the Nanchang City Company of the Coal Construction Company has also recently transported a large number of long timber that has been shortened. This shows that the phenomenon of wasting timber in timber allocation work is serious. It is hoped that the China Coal Industry Building Materials Company will pay attention to this matter.

### 岳阳县和南昌市的煤建公司  调拨木材时不应把长材截短

    岳阳县和南昌市的煤建公司
    调拨木材时不应把长材截短
    中国煤业建筑器材公司苏州市公司木材营业员许淡云来信：今年一月二十日煤建公司岳阳支公司调拨给我公司一批西湖广木。这些木材都是二十公尺长的百年良材，但他们为了装车时方便，竟把这样的长材锯成十一公尺左右。长材的主要用途是水利工程、桥梁、造船和一些较大的建筑工程。而岳阳支公司单纯为了完成调拨任务，居然把国家的宝贵良材一锯两段，以致不能适合上述工程的需要。这种破坏国家资财的行为是难以容忍的。这批木材锯短以后我公司在价格上的损失便在一亿元以上；其他兄弟公司也收到不少同样的木材。值得注意的是：最近煤建公司南昌市公司也运来大批长材短截的木材。这说明木材调拨工作上浪费木材的现象是严重的。希望中国煤业建筑器材公司重视这件事。
