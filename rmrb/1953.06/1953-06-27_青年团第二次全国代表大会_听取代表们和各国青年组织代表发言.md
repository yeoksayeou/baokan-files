Xinhua News Agency Report: The Second National Congress of the China New Democratic Youth League continued on the 25th.

After group discussions on the afternoon of the 24th and the morning of the 25th, the delegates recognized the significant meaning of the important instructions on the work of the Youth League given by Comrade Liu Shaoqi, representative of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, in his congratulatory speech, and unanimously supported Hu Yaobang's work report.

A plenary session was held on the afternoon of the 25th. Five delegates, including representatives from the military, Beijing, Sichuan Province, and directly affiliated organizations of the Central People's Government, spoke at the meeting. Representatives of youth organizations from Vietnam, the German Democratic Republic, and Italy, who were invited to attend the conference, also delivered speeches.

Wang Zonghuai, head of the military delegation, after describing the work of the Youth League in the army, said: We must contribute our strength to defend the security of the motherland and peaceful construction, and to defend peace in the Far East and the world. Zhang Dazhong, Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the China New Democratic Youth League, based on the work of the Beijing Youth League, used vivid and concrete examples to illustrate that the Youth League organizations should conscientiously study the situation and special needs of young people under the guidance of the Party's policies, and effectively help them work and study better.

When Zhang Daohua, a blind model revolutionary disabled soldier of the Chinese People's Volunteers from Sichuan Province, was helped onto the stage by staff, the applause from the audience lasted for a long time. Zhang Daohua said, "I did medical work in the Volunteers. When escorting the last wounded soldier through the enemy's blockade line, my eyes were blinded by enemy bullets. At that time, I was a little distressed. The Party educated me, and the heroic image of Pavel Korchagin often encouraged me to move forward. I want to live well, work hard, and continue to contribute everything to the motherland."

She then described her arduous learning process of writing, studying current affairs and political and literary works. Through these studies, her political consciousness has been improved. In the hospital, she was rated as a learning model; last year, she gloriously joined the Communist Party of China.

She concluded: "After I came out of the hospital and returned to Chengdu, I took on propaganda work. I don't have eyes, so I listen with my ears and speak with my mouth. I have given about two hundred reports on the heroic deeds of the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army to workers, farmers, students, and cadres of organizations."

Han Decai, a hero of the Air Force of the Chinese People's Volunteers, introduced his heroic deeds of shooting down five enemy planes in four air battles and winning the title of Second-Class Combat Hero. His speech was warmly welcomed.

Qi Moujia, a representative of the directly affiliated organizations of the Central People's Government and a model worker in Beijing, reported in detail on his creation of the "asbestos board air filtration method" with the support of the Party. He grew from a fourteen-year-old soldier into a scientific worker under the Party's close cultivation. He said: "My main learning is on the job, in the process of struggling with difficulties, and in creative labor."

Le Duc Chinh, Executive Member of the Central Committee of the Vietnam National Salvation Youth League, then spoke. He said: "The Vietnam National Salvation Youth League has absorbed the rich experience of the China New Democratic Youth League and has become a powerful core force mobilizing the vast number of Vietnamese youth to actively participate in the war of resistance against France. In the process of fighting, production, and learning, Vietnamese youth have all learned the heroic examples of Huang Jiguang and Luo Shengjiao, Hao Jianxiu and Gao Yubao." He expressed that the experience summarized by this conference is of great significance to the Vietnamese youth movement, enabling Vietnamese youth to make greater contributions in the struggle for national independence and the defense of world peace. His speech was warmly welcomed by the delegates.

Johannes Kersch, a member of the Presidium of the Central Committee of the Free German Youth League, then spoke at the meeting. He said: "The heroic achievements you have created under the correct and strong leadership of the Communist Party of China and the great Chairman Mao Zedong have won the admiration of the Free German Youth. You have told the people of the world how to deal with imperialist aggressors." He also introduced Gerhard Seiler, a youth labor model from the German Democratic Republic, who participated in this congress and completed the five-year plan in two years and three months. His speech was warmly welcomed by the audience.

Ugo Pecchioli, National Secretary of the Italian Communist Youth Federation, paid tribute to the conference on behalf of the Italian Democratic Youth and the 450,000 members of the Italian Communist Youth Federation. He said: "We are separated by thousands of kilometers, but we are united by the same ideals and the same love for our people and youth. We are fighting for the same great cause—the victory of peace and socialism." The audience responded to his speech with warm applause.

After the foreign guests spoke, they then presented gifts to the conference. Le Duc Chinh, on behalf of the Central Committee of the Vietnam National Salvation Youth League, presented the conference with the emblem of the Vietnam National Salvation Youth League and sixty copies of the magazine "Resistant Vietnam"; Johannes Kersch, on behalf of the Central Committee of the Free German Youth League, presented the conference with a portrait of Thälmann, the great leader of the German working class, and a microscope; Ugo Pecchioli, on behalf of the Central Committee of the Italian Communist Youth Federation, presented the conference with a historical book about Italian youth in the anti-fascist national liberation war, an Italian art magazine, two famous paintings, and the Golden Star Badge of the Builders of the Italian Communist Youth Federation. The audience responded with warm applause to express their gratitude.

    据新华社讯：中国新民主主义青年团第二次全国代表大会二十五日继续举行。
    经过二十四日下午和二十五日上午的分组讨论后，代表们认识到中共中央代表刘少奇同志在祝词中对青年团工作的重要指示的重大意义，并一致拥护胡耀邦的工作报告。
    二十五日下午举行全体大会。部队代表、北京市代表、四川省代表和中央人民政府直属机关代表等五人均在大会上发言。应邀参加大会的越南、德意志民主共和国和意大利的青年组织的代表，也在大会上讲了话。
    部队代表团团长王宗槐在叙述了青年团在军队中的工作情况后说：我们今后一定要为保卫祖国的安全与和平建设、为保卫远东与世界和平而贡献出自己的力量。中国新民主主义青年团北京市委书记张大中根据北京青年团的工作情况，用生动具体的事例，说明青年团组织应当在党的方针政策指导下认真地研究青年的情况和青年的特殊要求，切实帮助他们更好地工作和学习。
    当四川省女代表双目失明的中国人民志愿军模范革命残废军人张道华被工作人员扶上台讲话时，台下掌声历久不息。张道华说，我在志愿军中做医务工作，为了护送最后一个伤员通过敌封锁线时，我的眼睛被敌人的子弹打瞎了。当时我有些苦恼。党对我进行了教育，保尔·柯察金的英雄形象经常鼓励我前进，我要好好地活下去，工作下去，继续为祖国贡献出我的一切。
    她接着叙述了她艰苦学习写字、学习时事政治和文艺作品的经过。经过这些学习，使她的政治觉悟得到了提高。在医院里，她被评为学习模范；去年她又光荣地加入了中国共产党。
    她最后说：我从医院出来，回到成都后，就担任宣传工作。我没有眼睛，就用耳听，用嘴说，向工人、农民、学生、机关干部作过约二百多次关于中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军的英雄事迹的报告。
    中国人民志愿军空军英雄韩德彩介绍了自己怎样在四次空战中击落敌机五架、荣获二级战斗英雄称号的英勇事迹。他的发言受到了极为热烈的欢迎。
    中央人民政府直属机关代表、北京市劳动模范齐谋甲详细地报告了他在党的支持下，创造“石棉板过滤空气法”的经过。他是在党的亲切培养下，由一个十四岁的小兵成长为一个科学工作者。他说：我最主要的学习，是在工作岗位上，向困难做斗争的过程中、在创造性的劳动中学习。
    越南救国青年团中央执行委员黎德整接着发言。他说：越南救国青年团吸取中国新民主主义青年团的丰富经验，已成为一支动员越南广大青年积极参加抗法战争的强大的核心力量。在战斗、生产和学习的过程中，越南青年都学习黄继光和罗盛教，郝建秀和高玉宝的英雄范例。他表示，这次大会所总结的经验对于越南青年运动具有重大意义，使越南青年在争取民族独立和保卫世界和平的斗争中有着更大的贡献。他的发言受到了到会代表的热烈欢迎。
    自由德国青年联盟中央委员会主席团委员约翰纳斯·柯希接着在会上发言。他说：你们在中国共产党和伟大的毛泽东主席的正确坚强的领导下所创造出来的英雄业迹，博得了自由德国青年的钦佩。你们告诉了全世界人民怎样对付帝国主义侵略者。他在会上并介绍了参加这次代表大会的德意志民主共和国青年劳动模范盖尔哈特·赛莱尔，他在两年零三个月中完成了五年计划。他的发言受到全场热烈的欢迎。
    意大利共产主义青年团全国书记处书记雨果·彼齐奥利代表意大利民主青年和意大利共产主义青年团四十五万团员向大会致敬。他说：我们中间隔着几千公里，但我们被同样的理想以及对我们的人民和青年的同样的爱所结合在一起了。我们是为着同一伟大事业——和平与社会主义的胜利而奋斗。全场对他的讲话报以热烈的鼓掌。
    外宾们在讲话后，接着向大会献礼。黎德整代表越南救国青年团中央委员会献给大会越南救国青年团团徽和“抗战的越南”杂志六十册；约翰纳斯·柯希代表自由德国青年联盟中央委员会献给大会德国工人阶级的伟大领袖台尔曼的画像，并赠送大会显微镜一架；雨果·彼齐奥利代表意大利共产主义青年团中央委员会献给大会一本意大利青年在反法西斯民族解放战争中的历史书籍、一本意大利艺术画刊、二幅名画和意大利共产主义青年团建设者的金星章。全场报以热烈的掌声，对他们表示谢意。
