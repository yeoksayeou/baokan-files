Central Geological Department Team 429 Geologists Achieve Remarkable Results in Learning from Soviet Advanced Experience

The geologists of Team 429 of the Central Geological Department, through studying advanced Soviet experience, have played an important role in ensuring the completion of resource exploration tasks for key construction projects.

China's famous Daye Iron Mine began exploration work as early as sixty years ago. Geologists from imperialist countries such as France, Germany, Britain, Japan, and the United States also came to the Daye mining area to conduct surveys, some even carrying out considerable drilling work. However, all of these exploration efforts, which followed capitalist viewpoints and methods, had two fundamental weaknesses: the estimation of ore reserves was divorced from reality, and many important geological problems could not be correctly concluded. Consequently, mining operations based on this data resulted in a serious waste of mineral resources and investment.

Since May 1952, under the guidance of advanced Soviet geological exploration experience, Team 429 of the Central Geological Department has launched a comprehensive exploration of the Daye Iron Mine. Using advanced Soviet geological viewpoints and exploration methods, they have solved many geological problems that had not been resolved historically in over ten months of work.

In July 1952, just as Team 429 was preparing for large-scale exploration projects, Soviet geological expert Korotki, braving the summer heat, personally visited the Daye mining area to provide guidance. After observing all the exploration sites, he offered many valuable suggestions on the basic viewpoints and methods of geological work. He pointed out that the purpose of people's geological work is to find minerals, and all activities of geological personnel must be responsible to the people. They should not be satisfied with estimations divorced from reality, nor should they only pay one-sided attention to saving costs and be afraid to boldly verify geological problems. Geological exploration is a comprehensive science, and surveying, geophysical prospecting, geology, trenching, drilling, and laboratory testing must be closely coordinated to fully exert their effectiveness; geological personnel must combine theory with practice, and pay attention to studying theory even in fieldwork. These advanced Soviet geological work experiences became the strength for Team 429 to overcome difficulties. Large areas of ore bodies in the Daye Iron Mine are exposed on the surface of the mountains and extend for a long distance. However, the ore bodies exposed above ground were interrupted in the Jianlinshan area. In the past, experts from many capitalist countries were not sure whether there were iron deposits in this area, calling it an incomprehensible "fault." In the past, the geologists of Team 429 also only made theoretical judgments based on the geological phenomena they saw on the surface. Geophysical prospecting personnel also only inferred the location of ore bodies based on the magnetic reflections they measured. Therefore, regarding whether there was iron ore in Jianlinshan, they could only conclude that "there is a 50% possibility of ore." However, after implementing the Soviet expert's suggestion, combining the results of geophysical prospecting with the inferences of the geological personnel, conducting thorough indoor research, and boldly drilling, they have now found a new magnetite ore body deep in the rock formation of Jianlinshan. Only a few pieces of broken ore were exposed on the ground in Jinshandian. In the past, it was always believed that it was impossible for a large amount of iron ore to exist here. According to advanced Soviet experience, the geologists of Team 429 conducted geophysical prospecting in Jinshandian, and then carried out extensive trenching. As a result, they discovered the existence of a huge ore body. Preliminary drilling has proved that in some places the thickness of the ore body reaches more than eighty meters. Shizishan is an old ore body that has been mined for many years. During the Japanese imperialist occupation, considerable drilling work was carried out, with the deepest hole reaching sixty meters. Now, Team 429, implementing the Soviet expert's suggestion to drill deep holes, has found that even in the original drilling site, there is still iron ore below one hundred and thirty-five meters.

The geologists of Team 429 have gone through a very tortuous road in learning from advanced Soviet geological exploration experience. In July last year, Soviet expert Korotki proposed that when filling in geological maps, in addition to filling in ore bodies exposed above ground, ore bodies covered by soil should also be filled in after preliminary trenching. This is a true geological map; otherwise, it is merely a topographic map. Some geologists in Team 429 resisted this suggestion for a long time. They said that forcibly digging away the soil in places where ore outcrops were originally invisible in order to fill in the map is not a geological map, but only a bedrock map. Some individual geologists even said that not filling in the geological map according to the original appearance of the mining area, but instead carrying out excavation, is destroying nature. They did not realize that the purpose of filling in geological maps is to understand the ore body, not to fill in geological maps for the sake of filling in geological maps. This erroneous view was not corrected until January of this year when the Central Geological Department held a geological conference and Soviet expert Loginov repeatedly elaborated on the basic viewpoints of geological work. Only then did they "suddenly realize" and revise the original geological maps. The geological point method is an important experience in Soviet geological work. It can ensure the accuracy of work and improve work efficiency. This experience was introduced to Team 429 in June last year, but they believed that they had never done it this way before, and that making geological points was only for "the convenience of future inspections of our work." Therefore, they adopted a perfunctory attitude and did not do it seriously. This conservative thought was not criticized until the Central Geological Conference in January of this year. In March of this year, they made preparations in advance and made full use of the role of geological points. Data that used to take several trips up the mountain to collect completely can now be collected in one trip. The Tieshan geological work group, due to the use of these scientific geological work methods, basically completed the resource exploration report for the Tieshan area by the end of April according to national requirements, and sent the report to the Central Geological Department on May 15. Such a precise geological exploration report is the first in the history of geological work in our country. The amount of minerals calculated in this report is greater than any amount estimated in any period in the history of our country.

Currently, learning from advanced Soviet geological work experience has become a conscious action for the vast number of geologists in Team 429.

Many geologists have signed up for Russian language crash courses. The personnel of the Tieshan geological group have already formulated a plan for learning from advanced Soviet experience. However, some geologists in the outer areas of Team 429 are either just beginning to learn from advanced Soviet experience or have not yet officially started, which affects the development of geological work. This is inseparable from the lack of a unified plan and leadership for the entire team in learning from advanced Soviet experience. This issue must be taken seriously; otherwise, the work of learning from advanced Soviet experience cannot be universally deepened. (Ma Guang, Ke Da)

    学习苏联先进经验获得显著成效
    中央地质部四二九队地质人员学习苏联先进经验，对保证完成重点建设的资源勘探任务，起了重要的作用。
    我国著名的大冶铁矿，远在六十年前就开始了勘探工作。法国、德国、英国、日本、美国等帝国主义国家的地质学家们，也曾先后到大冶矿区进行过勘查，有的并作了相当规模的钻探工作。但是，所有这些沿用资本主义的观点和方法进行的勘探工作，都有两个根本性的弱点。那就是对矿藏量的估计脱离实际，和对很多重要地质问题无法作出正确的结论。因之，根据这些资料所进行的开采工作，也就造成矿藏资源和开采投资的严重浪费。
    一九五二年五月以来，在苏联先进地质勘探经验的指导下，中央地质部四二九队展开了全面勘探大冶铁矿的工作。他们运用苏联先进的地质学观点和勘探方法，经过十个多月的工作，解决了很多历史上所没有解决的地质问题。
    一九五二年七月，四二九队刚刚作好大规模勘探工程的准备工作，苏联地质学专家柯罗特基就冒着夏天的酷暑，亲自到大冶矿区指导工作。他在观察了全部勘探工地以后，就地质工作的基本观点和方法，提出了许多宝贵的建议。他指出人民地质工作的目的是找矿，地质人员的全部活动都要对人民负责，不能满足于脱离实际的估计，也不能只片面地注意节约成本不敢大胆地去证实地质问题。地质勘探工作是综合性的科学，测绘、物理探矿、地质、槽探、钻探、化验等各种工作必须密切配合，才能充分发挥效力；地质人员要把理论和实践结合起来，在野外工作同样要注意研究理论。这些苏联先进的地质工作经验，变成了四二九队克服困难的力量。大冶铁矿区大片矿体都露在山表面上，蔓延很长，而露出地面的矿体在尖林山一带中断了，过去许多资本主义国家的专家们对于这个地区是否有铁矿都不能肯定，把它叫做不可理解的“断层”。过去，四二九队的地质人员也只根据自己从地面上看到的地质现象进行理论上的判断；物理探矿人员也是只就自己测验出来的磁力反映推想矿体的位置，因之，对于尖林山是否有铁矿，也只能作出“有矿的可能性占百分之五十”的结论。但是，当他们贯彻苏联专家的建议，把物理探矿的成果和地质人员的推论结合起来，进行了周密的室内研究，并大胆地进行钻探以后，现在已在尖林山岩层深处找到了一个磁铁矿的新矿体。金山店露在地面上的仅有少数碎矿石，过去一直认为这里不可能有大量铁矿存在。四二九队的地质人员根据苏联的先进经验，在金山店作了物理探矿以后，展开了广泛的槽探，结果发现有巨大矿体存在。经过初步钻探证明，有的地方矿体的厚度达到八十公尺以上。狮子山是一个开探多年的旧矿体，日本帝国主义占领时期，作过相当规模的钻探工程，最深一孔打了六十公尺，现在，四二九队贯彻苏联专家要打深钻的建议，发现就是在原来钻孔的所在地，一百三十五公尺以下仍然有铁矿。
    四二九队的地质人员学习苏联先进的地质勘探经验，曾经走过一段十分曲折的道路。去年七月，苏联专家柯罗特基提出：在填地质图时，除把露出地面的矿体填出以外，对于被土壤盖着的矿体，也应经过初步槽探，把它填写上去，这才是真实的地质图，不然就仅仅是地形图。四二九队有些地质人员对于这项建议曾长时期抱着抵抗情绪。他们说，原来看不见矿体露头的地方，硬把土壤挖去以便填图，这不是地质图，只能叫做岩盘图。甚至有个别地质人员说，不按照矿区的原来面貌填地质图，而去进行挖掘，这是破坏自然。他们没有认识到，填地质图的目的是为了了解矿体，而不是为了填地质图而填地质图。这种错误看法，直到今年一月中央地质部召开地质会议时，苏联专家洛基诺夫反复论述了地质工作的基本观点以后，他们才“恍然大悟”，又重新修改原来填绘的地质图。作地质点法，是苏联地质工作的一项重要经验，它可以保证工作准确，又能提高工作效率。这项经验去年六月就被介绍到四二九队，但是，他们认为过去从来没有这样作，作地质点不过是为了“将来检查我们工作时的方便”，因之，就抱着敷衍态度，不认真去作。这种保守思想，直到今年一月中央地质会议上才得到批判。今年三月，他们事先作好准备工作，充分利用了地质点的作用，过去要上山几次才能收集齐全的资料，现在一次就收集起来了。铁山地质工作组由于使用了这些科学的地质工作方法，他们按照着国家的要求，在四月底基本上完成了铁山地区的资源勘探报告，并于五月十五日把报告送到中央地质部。像这样精确的地质勘探报告，在我国地质工作历史上还是第一个。这个报告所计算出来的矿量比我国历史上任何时期所估计出来的矿量都大。
    目前，学习苏联先进的地质工作经验，已经成为四二九队广大地质人员自觉的行动。
    很多地质人员报名参加俄文速成学习班。铁山地质组的人员，已经订出学习苏联先进经验的计划。但是，四二九队外围地区的地质人员对学习苏联先进经验，有的正在开始，有的还没有正式开始，影响着地质工作的开展。这与整个队对学习苏联先进经验缺乏统一的计划和领导是分不开的。必须重视这个问题，否则学习苏联先进经验的工作，就不能普遍的深入下去。（马光、可达）
