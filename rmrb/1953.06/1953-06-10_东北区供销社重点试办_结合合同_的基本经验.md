Following the initial experiences of the Erdaogou Village Supply and Marketing Cooperative and mutual aid teams in Yongji County, Jilin Province, in signing integrated contracts in the spring of 1952, rural supply and marketing cooperatives in various parts of the Northeast region are now focusing on promoting integrated contracts. According to incomplete statistics, by the end of 1952, 1,782 grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives and 619 agricultural production cooperatives, and 5,845 mutual aid teams had signed integrated contracts.

The trial implementation of integrated contracts by supply and marketing cooperatives in the Northeast region has yielded significant gains. First, it strengthened the planning of both production and supply and marketing. Through the signing of integrated contracts, supply and marketing cooperatives further understood the needs of cooperative members for supply and marketing, and formulated more realistic business plans; agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams gradually reduced the blindness of production and sales through the signing of integrated contracts, and improved production enthusiasm. The Jianshan Village Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Keshan County, Heilongjiang Province, through the signing of integrated contracts with mutual aid teams, roughly estimated the supply and marketing situation of the entire village of 2,300 people, thereby reversing the view of some cadres that grassroots cooperatives could not engage in planning.

Second, the integrated contracts signed by mutual aid teams and supply and marketing cooperatives played a positive role in increasing production and expanding business, and also strengthened the collectivist ideology of farmers. The Xue Yunhu mutual aid team in Erdaogou signed an integrated contract with the supply and marketing cooperative last year, obtaining the guarantee of the supply and marketing cooperative to fully supply the main means of production, and achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest of rice. The members of the team reflected: "In the past, we worried about three things (production, buying, selling), but after integration, we only worry about one thing (production)." Many supply and marketing cooperatives expanded their business because of signing integrated contracts. The Yongfa Village Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Nenjiang County, Heilongjiang Province, originally planned to sell 1,000 jin of ammonium sulfate, but after signing integrated contracts with mutual aid teams, it immediately discovered that this number could not meet the needs of farmers, so it increased the plan to 7,000 jin. Through the signing of integrated contracts, cooperative cadres further clarified the view of serving production, strengthened their sense of responsibility, and improved business management on this basis.

The supply and marketing cooperatives in the Northeast region have gained the following basic experiences in the trial implementation of integrated contracts.

First, formulating the production and consumption plans of agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams is a prerequisite for signing integrated contracts. It is relatively difficult for farmers to start formulating realistic plans, while supply and marketing cooperatives have a relatively solid foundation in planning work. Therefore, they should actively help mutual aid teams formulate production plans under possible conditions, and formulate consumption plans based on production plans. (Note: The requirements for the formulation and implementation of consumption plans should not be too high, and the plans for specific commodity varieties should not be too rigid, but should be limited to the most necessary main varieties.) The Erdaogou Supply and Marketing Cooperative held a training class for mutual aid team planners before the autumn harvest last year, training 44 planners, creating favorable conditions for mutual aid teams to carry out planning work. In principle, the content of the plan should go from simple to complex, from less to more, and at the same time, it must be based on national and market needs, telling farmers what to produce, how much to produce, and how to invest the surplus in expanding reproduction, etc. Experience has proved that farmers are very welcome to planning. With production and consumption plans, farmers have a more reliable basis for supply and marketing cooperatives to formulate their own business plans.

Second, integrated contract is a form of organizing farmers from the perspective of supply and marketing, which not only enables farmers to obtain practical benefits economically, but also gives farmers collectivist influence politically. At the beginning of signing integrated contracts, mutual aid team members and agricultural production cooperative members generally had the view that "integration or no integration is the same production" and "you can buy goods anywhere if you have money"; supply and marketing cooperative cadres had wrong ideas such as "afraid of trouble" and "beneficial to mutual aid teams, but not beneficial to cooperatives." Therefore, when conducting education, it is necessary to first require cooperative cadres to establish the basic view of serving production, and to recognize that integrated contract is an important method for supply and marketing cooperatives and agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams to implement the division of labor between production and sales and closely integrate to achieve planned development of production. When conducting publicity and education to farmers, it must be explained that integrated contracts enable the state to better develop production in a planned way, and enable farmers to develop production under the national plan, which is beneficial to the country and to farmers. If the one-sided emphasis on integrated contracts is only beneficial to farmers, it will foster the idea of "seeking cheapness" among farmers and make the cooperative business passive.

Third, signing integrated contracts on the basis of "voluntary mutual benefit" can consolidate and improve integrated contracts. The general requirements of farmers for signing integrated contracts are: fair commodity prices, guaranteed quality, timely supply, and priority purchase; the requirements of supply and marketing cooperatives are: for the main commodities that supply and marketing cooperatives can supply and purchase, the other party should preferably not buy or sell them in the free market. The concerns and difficulties of farmers are: fear of suffering losses, fear of being restricted, fear that the plan is not accurate and emphasis on implementing the plan; the concerns and difficulties of supply and marketing cooperatives are: fear of not being able to guarantee the source of goods and delaying production, fear that farmers will not keep their promises and have long-term arrears. In order to overcome difficulties and eliminate the ideological concerns of both parties, these issues must be fully consulted and repeatedly explained, and then the requirements of both parties should be fixed in the contract on the basis of "voluntary mutual benefit." The integrated contract mainly specifies the important varieties, quantities, supply and marketing procedures and seasons of business exchanges between the two parties, the obligations, responsibilities, and effective period of the contract, etc. In order to make the integrated contract concrete, a contract for the execution of the contract should also be signed, the content of which should be as specific and clear as possible.

Fourth, investigating the source of goods and signing contact contracts are important steps to realize integrated contracts. Before signing integrated contracts, in addition to helping mutual aid teams formulate production and consumption plans, supply and marketing cooperatives should also make full preparations, that is, according to the supply and marketing requirements of farmers, understand the source of goods and purchase situation from higher-level cooperatives and state-owned enterprises, and link the economic activities of various departments together in the form of contracts, mutually restrict each other, and jointly abide by them, so as to better and more correctly organize supply and marketing in accordance with the provisions of the contract. In addition, the responsibilities of planning, accounting, sales, and purchasing personnel should also be clarified within the supply and marketing cooperative, and the content of the contract should be specific to each team and each person, and contact contracts should be signed in work to supervise and check each other to ensure the completion of the plan.

Fifth, establish a regular inspection system to supplement and revise the contract to make it more practical. Checking the implementation of the contract is a complicated and tedious task, but it must be adhered to. The current methods of cooperatives in various parts of the Northeast to check integrated contracts are roughly these: 1. There are several attached pages to the execution of the contract, indicating the specific names of the goods bought and sold, which are filled in on the table after the transaction occurs; 2. Mutual aid teams use cards to buy goods, and use three-part forms to sell agricultural and sideline products, which are statistically checked by the cooperative. This method adds a layer of procedure in business, but it is correct and clear; 3. Expand the scope of collective pick-up of goods, the common parts of the mutual aid team can be picked up collectively, and the personal consumption parts are picked up by themselves; collective pick-up during busy farming season, and personal pick-up during slack farming season, which is convenient for inspection and cleaning.

Cooperative cadres generally have the idea of being afraid of trouble in checking contract work, but checking the contract on schedule is an important link in consolidating the contract. Failure to check will make the contract a mere formality. Therefore, in carrying out this work, we must pay attention to criticizing the cadres' idea of being afraid of trouble, enlighten them to find tricks, and constantly improve and simplify the inspection procedures, only in this way can the contract be consolidated. After signing the contract, both parties should also hold regular symposiums to provide opinions on the implementation of the contract. On the basis of mutual agreement, modify and supplement the original contract to make the contract gradually perfect; but it is necessary to prevent easily and arbitrarily modifying the contract.

Sixth, both parties should consciously fulfill the contract and establish the legal concept of the contract. Law is a binding force, and both parties must strictly abide by it and execute it, and neither party shall destroy it. But the real binding force should be established on the basis of consciousness, and consciousness is only possible when political awareness is improved. In the integrated contract signed between the Jiuyu District Supply and Marketing Cooperative and the Duchang Agricultural Production Cooperative in Jianchang County, Rehe Province last year, it was stipulated that 300 jin of bean cake should be supplied, but because the supply and marketing cooperative did not seriously investigate and organize the source of goods in advance, it was discovered that there were no goods at the time; in order to fulfill the contract, the supply and marketing cooperative actively tried to purchase from places more than 200 li away. Although the supply and marketing cooperative has shortcomings in operation, this spirit of resolutely fulfilling the contract is good, and it has also received a good response from the members of the Duchang Agricultural Production Cooperative, strengthening their concept of fulfilling the contract.

In the past year, there are still many shortcomings in the trial implementation of integrated contracts by supply and marketing cooperatives in various parts of the Northeast region. The main manifestations are various forms of formalism, such as some areas do not go through full discussion by the masses, and the cadres of both parties write a large book of contracts after a talk, and some cooperative cadres have a one-sided task view, and in order to respond to the call, temporarily grab a few cadres to carry out pilot projects and formally sign many integrated contracts. In the 29 contracts signed by the eight supply and marketing cooperatives and mutual aid teams in Jiangmifeng District, Yongji County, two-thirds of the contracts were reduced to formalities due to the lack of mass base and ideological foundation, and the rest were not seriously implemented. In some areas, due to the lack of a view of serving production in signing integrated contracts, integration has instead affected production; some supply and marketing cooperatives one-sidedly emphasize supporting production, causing a large number of arrears on the part of mutual aid teams. Many areas attempt to make the integrated contract perfect, and even include some non-major means of production and living materials such as "needles and threads" into the integrated contract, which cannot be implemented and cannot be checked. The above-mentioned shortcomings in the signing and execution of integrated contracts need to be corrected in the future. In the process of promoting integrated contracts, cooperatives in various regions must constantly discover new problems and summarize experiences in a timely manner, so that integrated contracts can be continuously enriched and improved.

    东北区供销社重点试办“结合合同”的基本经验
    全国合作总社东北区办事处  组教处处长  杨培伦
    继一九五二年春吉林省永吉县二道沟村供销合作社和互助组订立结合合同并取得初步经验之后，东北区各地农村供销合作社正在重点推广结合合同。据不完全统计，到一九五二年底，已有一千七百八十二个基层供销社和六百十九个农业生产合作社、五千八百四十五个互助组签订了结合合同。
    东北区供销社试行结合合同，已经取得了重大的收获。首先是加强了生产与供销双方的计划性。供销社通过订立结合合同，进一步了解了社员群众对供销的要求，制订了比较切合实际的业务计划；农业生产合作社、互助组通过订立结合合同，逐渐减少了生产和推销的盲目性，提高了生产积极性。黑龙江省克山县尖山村供销社通过和互助组订立结合合同，大体上把全村两千三百人的供销情况都估算出来了，因此，扭转了部分干部认为基层社不能搞计划的看法。
    其次，互助组和供销社订立的结合合同，对于增加生产、扩大业务起了良好的作用，同时也加强了农民的集体主义思想。二道沟薛云虎互助组去年和供销社订立了结合合同，取得供销社充分供应主要生产资料的保证，稻谷空前丰收。该组的组员反映：“过去操三条心（生产、买、卖），结合以后只操一条心（生产）就行了。”许多供销社因为订立结合合同而扩大了业务。黑龙江省嫩江县永发村供销社原计划推销一千斤硫安，和互助组签订结合合同后，立即发现这个数字不能满足农民要求，于是把计划提高到七千斤。通过订立结合合同，合作社干部进一步明确了为生产服务的观点，加强了工作责任心，并在这个基础上改善了经营管理。
    东北区供销合作社试行结合合同，取得了如下几点基本经验。
    第一，制订农业生产合作社、互助组的生产与消费计划是签订结合合同的先决条件。农民开始制定切合实际的计划比较困难，而供销社在计划工作上是比较有基础的，因此应在可能的条件下主动帮助互助组订立生产计划，并以生产计划为依据制定消费计划。（按：关于消费计划的制订和按计划执行的要求不能太高，在具体商品品种的计划上更不能定的太死，而应限于最必需的主要品种。）二道沟供销社在去年秋收前举办了互助组计划员训练班，训练了四十四名计划员，给互助组进行计划工作创造了有利条件。计划内容原则上应由简到繁，由少到多，同时还必须根据国家和市场需要，告诉农民生产什么，生产多少，以及怎样把积余投入扩大再生产等等。经验证明：农民对于计划是非常欢迎的。农民有了生产、消费计划，供销社制定本身的业务计划也就有了比较可靠的依据。
    第二，结合合同是从供销上把农民组织起来的一种形式，它不仅能在经济上让农民得到实际利益，而且能在政治上给予农民以集体主义的影响。在订立结合合同之初，互助组组员、农业生产合作社社员一般地存在着“结合不结合一样生产”、“有钱哪里买不出货来”的看法；供销社干部则存在着“怕麻烦”、“对互助组有好处，对合作社无利”等错误思想。因此，在进行教育的时候，必须首先要求合作社干部树立为生产服务的基本观点，要他们认识结合合同是供销合作社和农业生产合作社、互助组实行产销分工而又密切结合，以达到有计划地发展
    生产的重要方法。在向农民进行宣传教育时，必须说明：结合合同使国家能够更好地有计划地发展生产，使农民能在国家计划下发展生产，对国家、对农民都有好处。如果片面强调结合合同只对农民有利，就会助长农民“找便宜”的思想，使合作社业务陷于被动。
    第三，在“自愿互利”的基础上签订结合合同，才能使结合合同巩固和提高。农民对订立结合合同的一般要求是：商品价格公道，保证质量，及时供应，优先购买；供销社的要求是：凡是供销社可以供应和收购的主要商品，对方最好不在自由市场上买卖。农民的顾虑和困难是：怕吃亏，怕受限制，怕计划不准确又强调按计划执行；供销社的顾虑和困难是：怕不能保证货源而耽误生产，怕农民不讲信用而长期赊欠。为了克服困难和解除双方的思想顾虑，这些问题必须做到充分协商，反复解释，在 “自愿互利”的基础上，然后把双方的要求在合同上固定下来。结合合同主要是载明双方业务往来的重要品种、数量、供销程序和季节，双方的义务、责任、合同有效期限等。为了使结合合同的具体化，还应签订执行合同，其内容应尽可能具体、明确。
    第四，调查货源，订立联系合同，是实现结合合同的重要步骤。在签订结合合同之先，供销社除帮助互助组制定生产、消费计划外，还应进行充分的准备工作，即根据农民的供销要求，向上级社和国营企业了解货源及收购情况，并以合同形式把各部门的经济活动联结起来，相互制约，共同遵守，以便按照合同的规定，更好地、更正确地组织供销。此外，在供销合作社内部也应明确计划、会计、推销、采购人员的责任，把合同内容具体到每组、每人，并签订工作上的联系合同，相互督促检查，以保证计划的完成。
    第五，建立经常的检查制度，以便补充和修正合同，使其更切合实际。检查合同执行情况是复杂而又繁琐的一件事，但必须坚持做好。东北各地合作社目前检查结合合同的方法大体有这样几种：一、执行合同有若干附页，注明买卖货的具体品名，交易发生后即填在表上；二、互助组买货用卡片，卖出农副产品用三联单，由合作社统计检查。这种办法在业务上增加了一层手续，但是正确清楚；三、扩大集体取货的范围，互助组公用部分可集体取，个人消费部分自己取；农忙时集体取，农闲时个人取，这便于检查和清理。
    合作社干部在检查合同工作上一般存在着怕麻烦的思想，但按期检查合同是巩固合同的重要一环，不检查就会使合同流于形式。因此，在进行这一工作中要注意批判干部怕麻烦的思想，启发他们找窍门，不断地改进和简化检查的手续，只有这样，才能使合同得到巩固。订了合同后，双方还应当定期召开座谈会，提供执行合同中的意见。在双方同意的基础上修改和补充原订合同，使合同逐渐完善；但必须防止轻易地、任意地修改合同。
    第六，双方应自觉地履行合同，树立合同的法律观念。法律是一种约束力量，双方必须严格遵守执行，任何一方不得加以破坏。但真正的约束力量应该建立在自觉的基础上，而自觉又必须在政治觉悟提高的情况下才有可能。去年热河省建昌县九区供销社和杜昌农业生产合作社订的结合合同中曾规定供应三百斤豆饼，但因供销社事前没有认真调查和组织货源，结果到时才发现无货；供销社为了履行合同就积极设法到二百多里地以外的地方去采购。供销社经营上虽有缺点，但这种坚决履行合同的精神是好的，由此，也得到杜昌农业生产合作社社员们的良好反应，加强了他们履行合同的观念。
    一年来，东北区各地供销社在试行结合合同中还存在着不少缺点。主要表现在各种各样的形式主义，如有的地区不通过群众充分讨论，由双方干部
    一谈就写出一大本合同，有的合作社干部存在片面任务观点，为了响应号召，临时抓几个干部进行试点，形式地订立许多结合合同。永吉县江蜜蜂区八个供销社与互助组订立的二十九个合同中，由于缺乏群众基础和思想基础，就有三分之二的合同流于形式，其余的也没认真执行。有的地区在订立结合合同中，由于缺乏为生产服务的观点，结合以后，反而影响了生产；有的供销社片面地强调扶持生产，造成互助组一方大量赊欠的现象。有不少地区企图把结合合同订得十全十美，甚至把一些非主要的生产、生活资料如“针头线脑”都订入结合合同里面，结果不能执行，也无法检查。上述在签订和执行结合合同中所存在着的缺点都有待于今后努力加以纠正。各地合作社在推行结合合同当中必须不断地发现新的问题，及时总结经验，使结合合同不断地得到充实与提高。
