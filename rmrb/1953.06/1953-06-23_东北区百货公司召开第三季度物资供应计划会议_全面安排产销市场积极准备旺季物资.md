    Northeast China Department Store Holds Third Quarter Materials Supply Planning Meeting
    Comprehensively Arranging Production and Sales Markets and Actively Preparing for Peak Season Materials

    The Northeast China Department Store held a third-quarter materials supply planning meeting in early June. This meeting addressed the following issues: actively preparing for peak season materials supply during the off-season; comprehensively arranging production and sales markets within the Northeast region; and implementing the economic accounting system.

    In the first half of this year, department stores in various provinces and cities in Northeast China, in implementing the economic accounting system, experienced deviations such as neglecting market arrangements, reducing intra-regional procurement, emphasizing variety substitution, and simply compressing inventory. This resulted in disruptions in the production and sales markets, and only 90% of the first quarter's department store sales plan was completed.

    The scope and quantity of orders for the third quarter by the department stores have undergone significant changes. The ordering scope has expanded by fifteen categories of goods compared to the first half of the year; the order quantity is equivalent to 70% of the total value of orders in the first half of the year. Two hundred tons of candy and a large quantity of canned goods, toothpaste, and other products accumulated by local state-owned industries have been ordered by department store wholesale stations in various locations. Various tussah silks and serges produced by Liaodong local state-owned industries have been unsalable for many years. After active trial sales by department stores in Shenyang, Liaodong, and other places, sales channels have been opened; 2,283 bolts were ordered at this meeting. Department stores have fully underwritten the sales of 22 categories of goods produced in the third quarter, such as glass, rubber shoes, soap, and knitwear. In addition, department stores have ordered 35.7 billion yuan worth of accumulated industrial products. This has solved the problem of product backlog for industrial production.

    The work of preparing materials for the peak season during the off-season is conducted according to the commodity sales plan. Ordering goods from production enterprises based on this plan provides the conditions to ensure the realization of the commodity circulation plan, preventing the phenomenon of shortages due to insufficient procurement or stockpiles due to blind procurement. According to this plan, the Northeast China Department Store will purchase a large number of cotton rubber shoes, woolen fabrics, blankets, and woolen sweaters for winter use in the third quarter, which can be distributed to various city and county companies before the arrival of winter.

    In the first half of the year, some units, such as the department stores in Rehe and Fushun, made generalized estimates of people's purchasing power and only focused on purchasing high-quality, expensive goods from within the customs (i.e., areas south of the Great Wall), neglecting the purchasing power and actual needs of the vast number of farmers and ordinary residents. The Rehe Provincial Department Store purchased high-end hair oil, imported razors, shortwave radios, and other goods unsuitable for rural areas from within the customs, resulting in stockpiles. However, inexpensive white towels and athletic shoes produced in the Northeast, which are suitable for sale in rural areas, were out of stock. Department stores in various provinces and cities have learned from this lesson and have increased the procurement quantity of ordinary goods produced within the Northeast region according to the actual needs of residents in their respective regions. On the other hand, starting from the needs of the entire region, the import volume of goods from within the customs is still maintained at the same proportion as in the first half of the year. This is because the consumption level of workers in major cities and industrial and mining areas in Northeast China has significantly improved compared to last year, and there is a greater need for high-end goods. Currently, department stores in various provinces and cities are determining the standards for operating varieties based on the needs of residents in different regions and organizing sources of goods to ensure the needs of urban and rural markets for different commodities.

    At the same time, the production of certain industrial products within Northeast China has also greatly improved. For example, the ex-factory price of soap produced by the state-owned chemical plant is 12.5% lower in the third quarter than in the second quarter. The ex-factory prices of other products such as soap, paper, ceramics, pencils, and batteries have also been reduced. The quality of knitwear, enamelware, and other products has also begun to improve. For example, the quality and patterns of enamelware in Changchun are now the same as those of products from Shanghai, and the prices are also close to those of Shanghai products. This has given industrial products within Northeast China a broad market. (Li Jiyao)

    东北区百货公司召开第三季度物资供应计划会议
    全面安排产销市场积极准备旺季物资
    东北区百货公司在六月上旬召开了第三季度物资供应计划会议。这次会议，解决下列问题：在淡季积极为旺季的物资供应工作做准备；全面安排东北区内的产销市场，贯彻经济核算制。
    今年上半年，东北各省市百货公司在贯彻经济核算制中，曾发生忽略安排市场、缩小区内进货、强调品种代替、单纯压缩库存的偏差，因而造成产销市场紊乱的现象，第一季度的百货销售计划仅完成了百分之九十。
    第三季度百货公司的订货范围和订货数量都有了显著的变化。订货范围比上半年扩大了十五类商品；订货数量相当于上半年订货总值的百分之七十。地方国营工业积压的二百吨糖果和大批的罐头、牙膏等产品，都被各地百货批发站订购了。辽东地方国营工业生产的各种柞蚕丝绸、哔叽，多年滞销，经过沈阳、辽东等地百货公司积极试销，已打开了销路；在这次会议上，订购了二千二百八十三匹。第三季度生产的玻璃、胶鞋、香皂、针织品等二十二类商品，百货公司全部包销；另外百货公司还订购了三百五十七亿元的工业积存商品。这样就为工业生产解决了产品积压问题。
    在淡季为旺季准备物资的工作，是根据商品销售计划进行的。根据这个计划向生产企业订货，就有条件保证商品流转计划的实现，而不致产生少进货脱销或盲目进货积压的现象。根据这个计划，东北区百货公司第三季度将购进大批棉胶鞋、呢料、毛毯、绒衣等冬季用品，在冬季到来之前即可分拨到各市县公司。
    在上半年，有些单位，如热河、抚顺等地百货公司，笼统地估计人民购买力，只顾从关内采购质量高、价格贵的商品，忽略了广大农民和一般居民的购买水平和实际需要。热河省百货公司从关内购进高级头油、进口剃刀、短波收音机等不适合农村需要的商品，造成积压；但是东北出产的价格便宜的白毛巾、运动鞋等适合在农村销售的商品却脱销了。各省市百货公司接受了这个教训，分别按照本地区居民的实际需要，增加了东北区内生产的普通商品的采购数量。另一方面，从全区需要出发，对关内商品的进货量仍保持了上半年的比重。这是因为东北区各大城市和工矿地区的职工消费水平已较去年有了显著提高，对高级商品的需要较多。目前，各省市百货公司正在按地区居民需要情况确定经营品种的标准，组织货源，以保证城乡市场对于不同商品的需要。
    同时，东北区内某些工业品的生产也有了很大的改进，如国营化工厂生产的香皂，第三季度出厂价格比第二季度降低了百分之十二点五，其他如肥皂、纸张、陶瓷、铅笔、电池等产品的出厂价格也都降低了。针织、珐琅等产品的质量也开始提高，如长春的珐琅，质量、花样已经和上海的产品一样，价格也和上海的产品接近。这样就使东北区内的工业产品，有了广阔的市场。（李继尧）
