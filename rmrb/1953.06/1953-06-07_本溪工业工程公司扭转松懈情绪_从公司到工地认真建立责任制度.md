The anti-waste and responsibility system establishment movement of the Benxi Industrial Engineering Company has, after a high tide of inspections and exposure of waste and lack of accountability, timely transitioned to the construction phase. From the company's management departments to the engineering offices and construction sites, various responsibility systems are being established in response to the main problems that have been revealed.

This work of the company was gradually unfolded after overcoming ideological obstacles. When waste and lack of accountability had been largely exposed, a slackening mood began to appear among cadres and workers. They lacked sufficient understanding of the importance of establishing a responsibility system, feeling that: "Everything that should be exposed has been exposed, there is nothing more to do!" "We have already opposed waste and lack of accountability, the movement should be over." Some did not analyze or study the systems to be established at all, hastily drafting a few articles and calling it the establishment of a responsibility system. Obviously, such a responsibility system is useless.

In response to this situation, the anti-waste and responsibility system establishment movement committee of the company held a meeting to study the work of establishing a responsibility system, and unanimously clarified the following points: First, learning from the lessons of last year's "much exposure, poor establishment" and "the movement comes and goes in a gust," this year we must do a good job in establishing a responsibility system, which is an important key to consolidating the achievements of the movement. Second, establishing a responsibility system is a meticulous, in-depth, and arduous task. Therefore, the leadership must make the greatest efforts to do a good job in this stage of work. Third, the establishment of a responsibility system cannot be divorced from the main problems that have been exposed, and cannot be "established for the sake of establishment" in a general way; it must be analyzed and studied in light of the main problems that have been exposed, and several major responsibility systems must be established on the basis of raising mass awareness. The meeting decided that Zhao Ping, the company's deputy manager, and Jia Zhang, the deputy secretary of the Party committee, would specifically lead this stage of work, and strengthened the office of the anti-waste and responsibility system establishment committee, dispatching capable cadres to go deep into key units for inspection and supervision. Drafting groups were formed by technical personnel from departments and offices, representatives from engineering offices and construction sites, and veteran workers, who were responsible for drafting various responsibility systems. For example, the technical management responsibility system was drafted mainly by the technical office, with the participation of representatives from various engineering offices, construction sites, and veteran workers, while the technical supply responsibility system was discussed and formulated mainly by the materials section and equipment section. In this way, it can both prevent the content of the system from being empty and unrealistic, and avoid confusion, ensuring that the responsibility system is established systematically and in a planned manner from top to bottom.

The entire company's work of establishing a responsibility system started with the problems that urgently need to be solved at present. According to the problems that have been revealed, the biggest threat to construction and construction preparation work at present is the quality problem. Last year, due to the lack of a responsibility system in this regard, it caused huge losses to the country. This year, facing major engineering tasks, the entire company does not yet have a strict and complete set of quality standards and operating procedures. Therefore, it was decided to first focus on establishing a quality responsibility system. Secondly, the movement has revealed a large number of phenomena of work stoppages due to waiting for materials and wasteful work, the reasons for which are mostly due to the untimely supply of materials and unreasonable use and management of machinery and equipment. Therefore, it is also an urgent matter to establish a technical supply responsibility system. Then there are the dispatching responsibility system, financial management responsibility system, and administrative management responsibility system. Other responsibility systems such as security, original records, and personnel, should be carefully discussed among cadres and workers according to the specific situation, distinguishing between priorities and gradually establishing and implementing them.

    本溪工业工程公司扭转松懈情绪
    从公司到工地认真建立责任制度
    本溪工业工程公司的反浪费和建立责任制运动，已在检查、揭发浪费和无人负责现象的高潮上及时地转入建设阶段，从公司管理部门到工程处、工地，都开始针对揭发出的主要问题建立各项责任制度。
    该公司的这段工作是在克服了思想障碍后逐步展开的。当浪费和无人负责现象基本上被揭发出来的时候，干部和工人中开始显露出一种松劲情绪。他们对建立责任制的重要性认识不足，觉得：“该揭发的都揭发了，没有什么可搞的啦！”“我们已经反过浪费和无人负责的现象，运动应该结束了。”有的对应建立的制度根本未加分析、研究，草草拟就了几条就算建立了责任制。这样建立起来的责任制显然是没有用的。
    针对这种情况，该公司的反浪费和建立责任制运动委员会召开会议研究了建立责任制的工作，一致明确认识了这样几点：第一、接受去年“揭发多、建立差”“运动轰一阵过去”的教训，今年必须做好建立责任制的工作，这是巩固运动成果的重要关键。第二、建立责任制是一个细致、深入而艰巨的工作，因此，领导方面必须以最大的努力将这一阶段的工作做好。第三、建立责任制不能脱离已揭发的主要问题，泛泛地“为建立而建立”；必须针对已揭发的主要问题，进行分析研究，在提高群众觉悟的基础上建立起几项主要的责任制。会议决定由公司副经理赵萍，党委副书记贾章具体领导这一阶段的工作，并充实了反浪费与建立责任制委员会办公室的力量，分派得力干部深入重点单位检查督促，并由科、室技术人员、工程处、工地干部和老工人组成起草小组，负责拟定各种责任制度。如技术管理责任制是以技术室为主，吸收各工程处、工地代表和老工人参加讨论起草，技术供应责任制则以材料科设备科为主讨论制订。这样，既可防止制度内容空泛不切合实际，又可以避免混乱，保证自上而下有系统有计划地建立起责任制。
    整个公司的建立责任制工作，是从当前迫切需要解决的问题着手的。根据已经揭发的问题来看，当前对施工和施工准备工作威胁最大的问题是质量问题。去年由于这方面缺乏责任制，给国家造成了巨大的损失。今年面临着重大的工程任务，整个公司还没有一套严格的、完整的质量标准和操作规程，因此，决定首先抓紧建立质量责任制。其次，运动中大量揭发了过去以及现在施工中的停工待料、窝工浪费的现象，其原因大多是由于材料供应不及时，机械设备使用、管理不合理所致。因此，抓紧建立技术供应责任制也是件刻不容缓的事情。再就是调度责任制、财务管理责任制和行政管理责任制。其他如保安、原始记录、人事等责任制，要根据具体情况，在干部和工人中认真讨论，分清轻重缓急，逐步建立和贯彻。
