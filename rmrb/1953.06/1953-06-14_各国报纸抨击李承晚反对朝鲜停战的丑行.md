Xinhua News Agency, 13th. Asian and Western European newspapers are vehemently criticizing the Syngman Rhee group's clamoring against the realization of an armistice in Korea. The "Times of India" said: "If, as reported, the South Korean cabinet and National Assembly inhumanly and stubbornly insist on continuing the war and refuse to acknowledge the impending armistice agreement, then this foolish President Syngman Rhee should be made to understand reason. Peace must not be hindered by a man who desires power far more than he respects democracy." The newspaper stated that lives should not be sacrificed to support Syngman Rhee's position. It would be a clear benefit if this absurd and resentful person stepped down.

The Indian "Statesman" said: "If Syngman Rhee acts as recklessly as he speaks, only death awaits his personnel and his country."

The Indian "Delhi Express" said that Syngman Rhee's attitude "strangely reflects the absurd ambitions of this elderly President of South Korea." The newspaper said: "Syngman Rhee and South Korea were both fostered by the United States and depend on American military and economic aid to survive. Syngman Rhee's crude attitude towards the preliminary agreement on the Korean armistice uncomfortably recalls the inexplicably origins of this war. To properly assess President Eisenhower's promise regarding a mutual security treaty to be signed between the United States and South Korea, it is necessary to emphasize this point."

The Philippine "Manila Chronicle" editorial on the 7th called Syngman Rhee a quarrelsome and corrupt incompetent. He is merely acting "according to extremely narrow interests—not the interests of his country, but only the interests of his small group of immoral and influential politicians." "He has become a dangerous burden on the Allied side."

Britain's "Daily Express," under the headline "A Lame Duck's Arrogant Threats," attacked Syngman Rhee's bellicose clamoring.

Stockholm newspapers in the Swedish capital all denounced Syngman Rhee. "Dagens Nyheter" said: "The leaders of South Korea must be told that their opposition to the armistice agreement will not win anything, but will only lose everything."

The Dutch bourgeois liberal democratic People's Party newspaper "Het Algemeen Handelsblad" said: "Rhee's regime can hardly be considered legitimate by democratic standards. The semi-fascist youth movement and the reprehensible means of arresting members of parliament are the reasons for his re-election." The newspaper said that Syngman Rhee's demands are "very unreasonable, and his purpose must be to prevent an armistice." "De Volkskrant" said that Syngman Rhee's fist can only be regarded as a gesture, and may even cause an unpleasant reaction.

    各国报纸抨击李承晚反对朝鲜停战的丑行
    【新华社十三日讯】亚洲和西欧各国的报纸，都痛斥李承晚集团叫嚣反对在朝鲜实现停战的行为。 “印度时报”说：“如果像消息所说的，南朝鲜内阁和国民议会不近人情地固执地要继续进行战争，而硬不承认即将签订的停战协定，那么，现在应当使这个愚蠢的总统李承晚明白道理。和平绝不能因为一个渴望权力远过于尊重民主的人而受到阻碍。”该报说：不能为了支持李承晚一个人做官而牺牲生命。如果这个荒谬绝伦的怨天尤人的人下台，将会有明显的好处。
    印度“政治家报”说：“如果李承晚在行动上像他在言语上一样地鲁莽，等待着他的人员和他的国家的只有死亡。”
    印度“德里快报”说：李承晚的态度，“奇怪地反映了这个南朝鲜年老的总统的荒谬的野心。”该报说：“李承晚和韩国都是美国一手扶植起来的，要靠美国的军事和经济援助才能生存。李承晚对朝鲜停战初步协定所持的粗暴态度，使人不安地回想到这次战争的莫明其妙的起源。为了适当地估价艾森豪威尔总统所提出的关于美国和南朝鲜将签订共同安全条约的诺言，有必要强调这一点。”
    菲律宾的“马尼拉纪事报”七日社论称李承晚是一个喜爱争吵和腐朽无能的人。他只是“根据极为狭小的利益——不是他的国家利益，而只是他的一小撮毫无道德观念的有势力的政客的利益”。“他已经成为盟国方面的一个危险的负担。”
    英国的“每日快报”以“跛脚狗的狂妄的威胁”作为标题，抨击李承晚的好战叫嚣。
    瑞典首都斯德哥尔摩各报都斥责李承晚。“每日新闻”说：“必须向南朝鲜的领袖们说明，他们的反对停战协定不会赢得任何东西，而只会失去一切。”
    荷兰资产阶级的自由民主人民党报纸“世界商报”说：“李的政权按民主标准来说很难是合法的。半法西斯的青年运动和逮捕国会议员的应该受到斥责的手段，是使得他再度当选的原因。”该报说：李承晚的要求“非常不合理，他的目的一定是阻止停战”。“祖国报”说：李承晚的拳头只可以当作是一种姿态，甚至还会引起令人讨厌的反应。
