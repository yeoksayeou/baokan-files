    Editor's Note: Reader Wei Liqun has raised several dissenting opinions on Comrade Qi Xia's article "On the Junior Middle School Textbook 'Chinese History' (Volume 1)," published in this newspaper on April 14th. This article is Comrade Qi Xia's reply to these opinions. Comrade Qi Xia's basic arguments are correct.

    Comrade Wei Liqun has raised some opinions on my article "On the Junior Middle School Textbook 'Chinese History' (Volume 1)." I believe that some of Comrade Wei Liqun's opinions involve issues in the compilation of the junior middle school "History Textbook," and also involve the understanding of individual problems in criticizing the junior middle school textbook "Chinese History" (Volume 1); therefore, I feel it is necessary to explain further.

    First, Comrade Wei Liqun believes that the junior middle school "Chinese History" textbook is written in a dry and tasteless manner, which is not suitable for twelve- or thirteen-year-old children. Therefore, he believes that criticism of the textbook should focus on this aspect, examining its "unsuitable aspects," "not lecturing on grand principles, but using perceptual knowledge to make children love their motherland, using lively stories to make children understand the greatness of the Chinese people's power in history, ... not the issue of 'public fields' and 'private fields,' nor the issue of dividing 'feudal society' and 'slave society' into stages, but how hateful the feudal landlords were, how brutal the slave owners were, and how kind the peasants and slaves were, and how heroic they were when resisting the oppression of feudal lords and slave owners." "Therefore," Comrade Wei Liqun continued, "in the history of the Yin and Shang dynasties, we should focus on depicting the contradictions and struggles between slaves and slave owners; in the history of the Western Zhou dynasty, we should focus on depicting the contradictions and struggles between peasants, serfs, and feudal landlords, not on what land system."

    As everyone knows, as early as 1934, the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) put forward the principle of "teaching national history by using vivid and interesting ways and in chronological order, telling the most important events and facts, as well as the characteristics of historical figures" in the teaching of national history in Soviet schools. There is no doubt that the compilers of our history textbooks should also adhere to this principle of combining the content and form of correctly expressing historical reality in a vivid and interesting way. Therefore, Comrade Wei Liqun's pointing out that the textbook is dry and tasteless and that criticism of the textbook should focus on this aspect is entirely correct. However, in order to narrate history in a vivid and interesting way, can we ignore the content that history textbooks should have, and is it not necessary to explain the principles clearly? In this regard, I think Comrade Wei Liqun's view is worth discussing. Because Comrade Wei Liqun has overlooked an important prerequisite for compiling history in a vivid way, that is, it is necessary to correctly narrate historical events and facts, as well as the characteristics of historical figures.

    For example:

    In the process of human society's development from a lower stage to a higher stage, all exploiting classes who exploit and oppress the people have played a certain role in promoting historical development during certain periods of the transition between old and new social systems and the establishment of new social systems. Regarding this point, Stalin, in his great work "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR," comprehensively demonstrated that in other social forms before socialism and communism, the matter of "using economic processes and economic laws to benefit society to some extent" also occurred, thereby indicating to us that slave owners, feudal lords, and the bourgeoisie, these exploiting classes, played a progressive role within a certain period. However, if according to Comrade Wei Liqun's view, the content of the textbook should be nothing else but "how hateful the feudal lords were, how brutal the slave owners were," then, no matter how non-dry and easy for students to accept this textbook is narrated, how can it enable them to have a correct understanding of the different roles played by the exploiting classes in history at different periods, thereby leading them from history to an understanding of Marxism? It is obvious that if according to Comrade Wei Liqun's argument, not only the progressive role of the slave system under the conditions of the disintegrating primitive commune system and the feudal system that replaced the slave system would be completely obliterated, but also some historical figures could not be mentioned. This is the first example.

    The second example: In antagonistic class societies, there is always an "uninterrupted struggle, sometimes hidden, sometimes open" between the oppressors and the oppressed; and this hidden or open struggle arises from the economic foundation jointly constituted by the two antagonistic classes. Looking at feudal society, according to Lenin and Stalin's instructions, "Formerly, the main force was land—such was the case in the era of serfdom: whoever had land had power and authority." ("Selected Works of Lenin," Volume 3, page 307) "Of course, extra-economic coercion played a role in consolidating the economic power of the serf-owning landlords, but the foundation of the feudal system was not extra-economic coercion, but feudal land ownership." ("Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR," page 37) We know that feudal land ownership is the foundation of the feudal system; therefore, in order to fully explain the development of contradictions and struggles between peasants and feudal lords, we must fully expose this land ownership system. However, if according to Comrade Wei Liqun's view, "in the history of the Western Zhou dynasty," we only "focus on depicting the contradictions and struggles between peasants, serfs, and feudal landlords, not on what land system," "not on the issue of 'public fields' and 'private fields'," then from where did this "contradiction and struggle between peasants, serfs, and feudal landlords" that "should be focused on depicting" develop? Therefore, I feel that if we abandon the foundation of the feudal system—land ownership—and only "depict" the so-called contradictions and struggles, these contradictions and struggles will inevitably be empty words, and it will be impossible to achieve the teaching goal of "cultivating students' class feelings" (Comrade Wei Liqun's words).

    I believe that striving for vivid and interesting narration when compiling history textbooks is certainly important, but the true foundation of vivid and interesting narration or "depiction" is the correct narration of the content of historical events and historical figures. If we talk about vivid and interesting descriptions apart from this foundation, it is one-sided and harmful.

    Secondly, Comrade Wei Liqun believes that this argument is wrong: "The victory of peasant wars resulted in the emergence of the three great empires of Han, Tang, and Ming. Conversely, the failure of peasant wars resulted in warlord infighting and separatist rule, and foreign races took the opportunity to invade, leading to a situation of division and subjugation." Comrade Wei Liqun's first reason is that "it places the evils of warlord infighting... etc., on the head of the failure of peasant wars, instead of on the fact that the corruption, degeneration, contradictions, and struggles of the ruling class weakened the national power." According to Comrade Wei Liqun's logic, the social and economic development and the powerful national strength of the unified feudal state after the victory of peasant wars are also the credit of feudal rule and have nothing to do with peasant wars. This is fully demonstrated in Comrade Wei Liqun's second reason. Comrade Wei Liqun said: "Liu Bang, ... was the 'Sishang Pavilion Chief,' ... of course, he was not a peasant. His main assistant Xiao He was ... 'Chief Clerk,' Cao Can was 'Prison Clerk' ... Zhang Liang was an aristocrat. From this, it can be seen that the Han dynasty was created by large and small landlords leading the peasants."

    According to Comrade Wei Liqun's second reason and logical method, the Han dynasty was a political group of "large and small landlords leading the peasants," and the Qin dynasty can also be said to be a political group of large and small landlords leading the peasants (because the soldiers of Qin were mostly from peasant backgrounds). Therefore, this struggle was a struggle between two political groups of large and small landlords leading the peasants, and not a peasant uprising. By extension, Li Mi, Fang La, Zhong Xiang, etc., were all from landlord backgrounds, so they were not leaders of peasant uprisings either, and the peasant uprisings they led cannot be considered peasant uprisings.

    Comrade Wei Liqun's understanding is also inappropriate. Because we know that peasant wars in feudal society break out due to the corruption and degeneration of the feudal ruling class and their cruel exploitation, which makes it impossible for peasants to live. Because the peasant class is not the representative of new productive forces, but small producers in individual economy, without the leadership of an advanced class, peasant uprisings and peasant wars cannot eliminate the feudal system, and without the leadership of the proletariat, they can never be liberated from the position of being oppressed and enslaved. Therefore, from the perspective of the thorough liberation of the peasants, the hundreds of large and small peasant uprisings and peasant wars in our history have all failed.

    Looking at the specific situation of peasant wars, some small-scale peasant wars are suppressed by the feudal ruling class, and several nationwide large-scale peasant wars are nothing more than these two situations: one is that they defeat the feudal ruling class, overthrow the original feudal regime, and give the corrupt forces a serious blow; the other is that they are defeated by the feudal ruling class, the peasant uprising is suppressed, and the corrupt forces do not suffer a fatal blow. Therefore, in these two situations, for the feudal regime, the former can be said to be the victory of the peasant war, while the latter is the failure of the peasant war.

    According to the above situation, we cannot but gain the following understandings of peasant uprisings and peasant wars in feudal society:

       First, no matter what class he comes from (including those from the landlord class), as long as he leads a peasant uprising, resists the feudal regime, and fights against the feudal ruling class, he is the leader of the peasant uprising. Because his actions and will have represented the peasant class, and he has transformed from his original class status to the class status of the peasant class.

    This is why we call Liu Bang and others leaders of the peasant uprising in the peasant war. Therefore, Comrade Wei Liqun's saying that "large and small landlords led the peasants" because Liu Bang and others came from landlords is wrong in my opinion.

    Second, because peasants are not representatives of new productive forces and cannot establish a peasant regime, their uprising, although "opposes the landlords, but supports the 'good emperor'" (Stalin, "Conversation with the German writer Ludwig"), therefore, in the process of war victory, the leader of the uprising, even if he is from a peasant background, will inevitably gradually transform into a landlord. Therefore, the victory of the peasant war overthrows the old feudal regime, but what follows is still a feudal regime. The three nationwide peasant uprisings at the end of the Qin, Sui, and Yuan dynasties resulted in the emergence of the three great empires of Han, Tang, and Ming. The reason why these three unified centralized states were strong, and their economy, politics, and culture developed and surged, was mainly because the great power of the peasant war swept away the corrupt feudal forces, making the relations of production suitable for the nature of the productive forces. Therefore, from this great significance, we call the three great empires of Han, Tang, and Ming the result of the victory of the peasant war. However, Comrade Wei Liqun said that "the Han dynasty was created by large and small landlords leading the peasants," attributing all the achievements of the Han empire to the leadership of a few landlord elements, completely ignoring the driving role of the peasant war, which is also incorrect.

    Third, the reason why several great peasant uprisings, such as those led by the Yellow Turbans, Huang Chao, and Li Zicheng, failed was on the one hand due to some shortcomings inherent in the peasant uprising itself (these shortcomings came from the peasant class), and on the other hand, because the corrupt ruling class either maintained a strong force or colluded with foreign forces to jointly suppress the peasant uprising. Precisely because of the failure of these peasant wars, the corrupt forces of the landlord class were not severely hit, leading to a situation of division and separation and foreign invasion. In this way, it is precisely to expose the crimes of the landlord class and to embrace the truth that peasant wars are the real driving force for historical progress. However, Comrade Wei Liqun said that this is "placing the evils of warlord infighting... etc., on the head of the failure of the peasant uprising, instead of on the fact that the corruption, degeneration, contradictions, and struggles of the ruling class weakened the national power," which is of course also incorrect.

    As mentioned above, I believe that Comrade Wei Liqun's erroneous understanding of some issues is of a principled nature, and is also frequently encountered in historical teaching and historical research, so I think it is very necessary to bring it up for discussion. Stalin taught us that "Theoretical mistakes have never benefited anyone, and will not benefit anyone." Therefore, I also feel that today, for people like us who study or teach Chinese history, following Stalin's instructions and actively studying Marxism-Leninism is the most important thing, because without Marxism-Leninism, we cannot avoid "stumbling" in theory, or making great mistakes.

    由批评初级中学课本“中国历史”（第一册）引起的几个问题
    ——答复读者韦立群同志
    漆侠
    编者按：读者韦立群同志对四月十四日本报发表的漆侠同志的“关于初级中学课本‘中国历史’（第一册）”一文提出了若干不同意见，本文是漆侠同志对这些意见的答复。漆侠同志的基本论点是正确的。
    读者韦立群同志对我的“关于初级中学课本‘中国历史’（第一册）”一文提出了一些意见。我以为，韦立群同志有些意见，牵涉到初级中学“历史课本”编写方面的问题，也牵涉到对批评初级中学课本“中国历史”（第一册）中个别问题的认识问题；所以觉得有再说明一下的必要。
    首先，韦立群同志认为：初中“中国历史”课本编写得干燥无味，对于十二三岁的孩子是不适合的，所以他认为批评课本就应当从这一方面着眼，检查它的“不合适的地方”，“不是讲大道理，而是要用感性知识使孩子们爱自己的祖国，用生动活泼的故事，使孩子们了解历史上中国人民力量的伟大，……不是‘公田’‘私田’的问题，也不是
    ‘封建社会’与‘奴隶社会’划阶段的问题，而是封建地主如何可恶，奴隶主如何残暴，和农民与奴隶如何善良，可是在反抗封建主和奴隶主压迫的时候，又如何英勇”。“因此，——韦立群同志继续说——在殷商历史上，应该着重描写奴隶与奴隶主的矛盾、斗争，在西周历史上，应该着重描写农民农奴与封建地主的矛盾、斗争，不是什么土地制度。”
    如大家所知道的，远在一九三四年联共中央对苏联各学校的本国历史教学方面，就曾提出过“用生动有趣的方式和按照年代的次序，讲述最重要的事件和事实，以及历史人物底特点等以教授本国史”这样一个原则。没有疑问，对于以生动有趣的方式正确地来表达历史实际的这一内容和形式相结合的原则，我们的历史课本的编写者也同样是应当遵守的；所以韦立群同志指出课本的干燥无味，批评课本应该从这一方面着眼，是完全正确的。但为了生动有趣的讲述历史，是否就可以忽视历史课本应有的内容问题，而不必要讲清道理呢？我以为，在这一方面，韦立群同志的看法是值得商量的。因为韦立群同志忽略了生动的编写历史的一个重要前提，那便是必须正确地讲述历史事件和事实，以及历史人物的特点等。
    举例说：
    在人类社会从低级阶段到高级阶段发展的过程中，一切剥削人民压迫人民的剥削阶级在新旧社会制度交替以及新的社会制度建立的某些时期里，对历史的发展都是起了一定程度的推进作用的。关于这一点，斯大林在其“苏联社会主义经济问题”的伟大著作中，曾全面地论证了在社会主义和共产主义制度以前的其他的社会形态下，也同样地发生过
    “在某种程度内利用经济过程、经济法则来为社会谋福利”的事情，从而指示给我们：奴隶主、封建主和资产阶级这些剥削阶级，在一定时期之内发生过进步的作用。但如果按照韦立群同志的看法，课本的内容不应是别的，而只应是“封建主如何可恶，奴隶主如何残暴”的话，那么，这课本就是叙述得再不干燥，再容易使学生们接受，又怎么能使他们对于历史上的剥削阶级在不同时期所起的不同的作用这一点，有个正确的理解，从而使他们从历史走上对马克思主义的认识呢？显而易见，如果按照韦立群同志的论点，不仅在瓦解着的原始公社制度条件下的奴隶制度，代替了奴隶制度的封建制度，其进步作用要被一笔抹杀，就是有些历史人物也是无法被提出来的。这是第一个例子。
    第二个例子：在对抗性的阶级社会中，压迫者和被压迫者之间，总是“进行着不断的，有时是隐藏，有时是公开的斗争”；而这种隐藏的或是公开的斗争，乃是从两个对抗阶级所共同构成的经济基础上产生的。就封建社会来看，依据列宁和斯大林的指示，“从前主要的势力是土地，——在农奴制度时代就是如此：谁有土地，谁就有势力、有权柄。”
    （“列宁选集”第三卷，第三○七页）“当然，经济外的强制在巩固农奴制地主的经济权力方面起过作用，但封建制度的基础并不是经济外的强制，而是封建土地所有制。”（“苏联社会主义经济问题”第三七页）我们知道，封建的土地所有制乃是封建制度的基础；因此，要想充分说明农民和封建主的矛盾、斗争的发展，就必须充分揭露这种土地所有制。但如果按照韦立群同志的看法，“在西周的历史上”，只“着重描写农民农奴与封建地主的矛盾、斗争，不是什么土地制度”，“不是什么‘公田’‘私田’的问题”的话，这“应该着重描写”的“农民农奴与封建地主的矛盾、斗争”，又是从什么地方发展起来的呢？所以我觉得，假使抛弃了封建制度的基础——土地所有制，而只“描写”什么矛盾、斗争，这矛盾和斗争，也必然是空洞的言辞，而无法达到“培养学生们的阶级感情”（韦立群同志语）这一教学目标的。
    我认为，编写历史课本时，力求叙述的生动和有趣固属重要，但生动有趣或“描写”的真实基础，却是正确地叙述历史事件和历史人物的内容，如果脱离这一基础而谈生动、有趣的描写，那是片面的和有害的。
    其次，韦立群同志认为这个论点是错误的：“农民战争胜利的结果，出现了汉、唐、明三个大帝国，反之，农民战争失败的结果，军阀混战割据，外族乘虚侵入，出现了分裂沦陷的局面。”韦立群同志的第一个理由是，“因为它把军阀混战……等等罪恶，都放在农民战争失败的头上，而不放在统治阶级的腐化、堕落、矛盾、斗争削弱了国家力量的事实上”。按照韦立群同志的逻辑来推，农民战争胜利之后的统一的封建国家，其社会经济的发展，其国力之强大，也都是封建统治的功劳，而和农民
    战争无关。这在韦立群同志的第二个理由得到充分地证明。韦立群同志说：“刘邦，……是‘泗上亭长’，……当然不是农民了，他的主要助手萧何是……‘主吏掾’，曹参是‘狱掾’……张良是贵族。由此可知，汉是大小地主领导农民搞出来的。”
    按照韦立群同志的第二个理由和逻辑方法，汉这一方面是“大小地主领导农民”的政治集团，秦的一方面也可以说是大小地主领导农民（因为秦的兵士极大部分都是出身于农民的）政治集团，因此这次斗争，乃是两个大小地主领导农民的政治集团的斗争，而不是什么农民起义了。推而广之，李密、方腊、钟相等等，都是地主出身，所以他们也都不是农民起义的领袖，他们领导的农民起义都不能算做农民起义了。
    韦立群同志的这种认识也是不妥当的。因为我们知道，封建社会的农民战争，是由于封建统治阶级的腐化堕落及残酷的剥削，以致使农民无法生活下去才爆发起来的。由于农民阶级不是新的生产力代表者，而是个体经济的小生产者，所以没有先进阶级的领导，农民起义和农民战争是消灭不掉封建制度的，而没有无产阶级的领导，是永远不能从被压迫被奴役的地位解放出来的。因此，从农民彻底解放的这个意义上来说，我国历史上大小数百次的农民起义和农民战争都是失败了的。
    就农民战争的具体情况来看，一些小规模的农民战争都是被封建统治阶级镇压下去，而几次全国性的大规模的农民战争也不外乎这两种情形：一种是战败封建统治阶级推倒原先的封建政权，给腐朽的力量以严重的打击；一种是被封建统治阶级战败，农民起义被镇压下去，腐朽的力量没有受到致命的打击。因此，这两种情况，对封建政权而言，前者可以说是农民战争的胜利，而后者则是农民战争的失败。
    按照上述情况，我们对封建社会中的农民起义和农民战争是不能不得到如下几点认识的：
       一、不管他是什么阶级出身（地主阶级出身的包括在内），只要他领导农民起义，反抗封建政权，向封建统治阶级作斗争，他就是农民起义的领袖。因为他的行动和意志已经代表了农民阶级，他已经从其原来的阶级地位转化为农民阶级的阶级地位。
    这就是为什么在农民战争中我们要称刘邦等人为农
    民起义的领袖的道理。因此，韦立群同志因刘邦等
    人出身地主，而提出了“大小地主领导农民”这种说法，在我看来是不对的。
    二、由于农民不是新的生产力代表者，不可能建立农民政权，他们的起义，虽然“反对地主，可是拥护‘好皇帝’”（斯大林“与德国作家路得维希的谈话”），因此在战争胜利的过程中，起义的领袖即便出身于农民，也必然逐渐转化为地主。所以农民战争取得胜利，推倒旧的封建政权，但继之而起的仍然是封建政权。秦末、隋末、元末三次全国性的农民大起义，就出现了汉、唐、明三个大帝国。而这三个统一的集权国家之所以强大，其经济政治文化之所以发展、高涨，主要由于农民战争的巨大力量扫荡了腐朽的封建力量，使生产关系适合了生产力性质而形成的。因此，从这一重大意义上，我们称汉、唐、明这三大帝国是农民战争胜利的结果。但韦立群同志说“汉是大小地主领导农民搞出来的”，把汉帝国的一切成就都归之于几个地主分子的领导作用上，完全忽视了农民战争的推动作用，这也是不正确的。
    三、几次巨大的农民起义如黄巾、黄巢、李自成等领导的起义之所以失败，一方面因农民起义本身存在的一些缺点（这些缺点是来自于农民阶级的），另一方面由于腐朽的统治阶级或保持强大的力量，或勾结外来力量共同镇压农民起义。正是由于这几次农民战争的失败，地主阶级的腐朽的力量没有受到严重的打击，以至出现了分裂割据、异族侵入的局面。这样来说，正是揭露地主阶级的罪恶，服膺了农民战争是推动历史前进的真正动力这一真理。但韦立群同志说这是“把军阀混战……等等罪恶，都放在农民起义失败的头上，而不放在统治阶级的腐化、堕落、矛盾、斗争削弱了国家力量的事实上”，当然也是不正确的。
    如上所讲，我以为韦立群同志对有些问题的错误认识，都是带有原则性质的，而且也是在历史教学和历史研究工作中经常遇到的，所以，我觉得提出来商量一下很有必要。斯大林教导我们说：“理论上的失足，是从来没有使人得到好处，而且也不会使人得到好处的。”因此我又感到，在今天，对于像我们这样一些研究或教授中国历史的人来说，遵循着斯大林的指示，积极地学习马克思列宁主义是最重要的，因为离开了马克思列宁主义，我们便不能避免在理论上“失足”，或说是犯下极大的错误。
