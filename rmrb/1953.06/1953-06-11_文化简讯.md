Hunan Selects a Batch of Warring States Period Chu Cultural Relics to be Transported to Beijing

The Hunan Provincial Cultural Relics Management Committee has selected a batch of Warring States period Chu cultural relics to be transported to Beijing to participate in the Chu Cultural Relics Exhibition to be held in Beijing by the Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government to commemorate China's great poet Qu Yuan. The Chu cultural relics transported to Beijing include more than 290 pieces of bronzes, pottery, stoneware, lacquerware, and silk paintings, all of which were unearthed in Hunan before and after liberation. Among these cultural relics, important ones include an iron-footed bronze tripod, a balance similar to scales, and a set of bronze weights (all engraved with Chu characters). Among the weapons, there is a "wooden arm" crossbow discovered last year in the Yangtianhu Chu tomb in the suburbs of Changsha City. The crossbow is equipped with a bronze "trigger mechanism". The most outstanding is a silk painting, which was unearthed in the spring of 1949 in a Chu tomb in Chenjiadashan in the suburbs of Changsha City and is the earliest brush painting discovered in China. The painting is painted on a piece of silk fabric 30 cm long and 22 cm wide, depicting the image of an ancient woman. From this painting, we can see the forms of ancient Chinese clothing and the development of the silk weaving industry. Among the lacquerware are a lacquered mirror box and a lacquered shield. The lacquered mirror box was unearthed before liberation, and the box is engraved with very detailed various forms of birds, animals, and cloud patterns. There are also wooden combs and cosmetics in the box. The lacquered shield was discovered in a Chu tomb in Wulipai in the suburbs of Changsha City in 1951. The shield is made of cowhide and painted with black lacquer on both sides. The front is painted with dragon and cloud patterns in yellow, brown, and vermilion colors, and the back is painted with dragons and birds of prey in vermilion. The patterns are exquisite, and the colors are still bright. These cultural relics are important references for studying ancient Chinese culture and the social life of the Chu state.

    湖南选出战国时代楚国文物一批运京
    湖南省文物管理委员会为参加中央人民政府文化部即将在北京举办的纪念我国伟大诗人屈原的楚文物展览会，已选出战国时代楚国文物一批运往北京。这批运京的楚文物共计有铜器、陶器、石器、漆器、帛画等二百九十多件，都是解放前后在湖南出土的。这些文物中重要的有一个铁足铜鼎及一件类似天平的衡器和一套铜制法码（上面都刻有楚国文字）。在兵器中有一件去年在长沙市郊仰天湖楚墓中发现的“木臂”臂弩，臂弩上装有铜制“机括”。最特出的是一张帛画，这是一九四九年春在长沙市郊陈家大山一楚墓葬中出土的，是目前我国已发现的一幅最早的笔画。这幅画画在一幅长三十公分宽二十二公分的丝织的帛上，画上是一个古代妇女的形象。从这幅画上可以看出我国古代服装的形式和织帛手工业的发展情况。漆器中有一漆镜盒和漆盾。漆镜盒是解放前出土的，盒上刻有很细致的各种形态的飞禽走兽和云纹，盒内还有木梳和化妆品。漆盾是一九五一年在长沙市郊五里牌一楚墓里发现的。盾用牛皮制成，两面漆有黑漆，正面有用黄、褐、朱三种彩色画成的龙云纹图案，背面有用朱彩画成的龙和鸷鸟，图案精美，色泽尚鲜艳。这些文物都是研究中国古代文化和楚国社会生活的重要参考品。
