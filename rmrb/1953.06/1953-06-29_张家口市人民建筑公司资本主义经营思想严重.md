A letter from Yang Shuyin of the Basic Construction Section of the Zhangjiakou Leather Factory: Our factory's basic construction project was contracted to the Zhangjiakou Municipal Local State-owned People's Construction Company, with construction beginning in early October 1952. Soon after, we discovered that the company was employing malicious tactics such as cutting corners. For example, the company had carpenters replace oilers to lay the roofing felt, resulting in crooked and non-compliant work; at the same time, they used foul oil instead of oil paste, which would melt at normal temperatures. The quality of the roof mortar was poor, laid unevenly, and sometimes became loose. On a certain day in March this year, after only half an hour of snow, the roof leaked. The original design called for five steel bars in the ring beam, but this was reduced to four during construction. In addition, because the company's affiliated lime plant had a large stock of quicklime, they purchased over 10 million catties (worth 1 billion yuan) regardless of the project's needs, and stockpiled it at the site.

After we raised the above issues, the Zhangjiakou Municipal Party Committee severely criticized the company's erroneous practices and decided to change the project to be handled by the company on an agency basis. However, the company did not seriously correct its past mistakes, but instead adopted a passive and irresponsible attitude towards the construction project. For example, payments for labor, materials, and other expenses were made haphazardly, with over 20 million yuan overspent on transportation costs for raw materials in just one purchase. On-site management was extremely chaotic, with serious rework and delays. When reporting the construction expenses for last year, the company also resorted to deceptive means. For example, the actual area of brick wall pointing completed was 585 square meters, but the report listed it as 1,128 square meters; the actual volume of concrete base for the drying room completed was 9.21 cubic meters, but the report listed it as 33 cubic meters; the actual amount of steel used was over 5,800 catties, but the report showed 7,142 catties; the actual amount of binding wire used was 29.28 catties, but the report showed 89 catties... Moreover, the figures they reported several times were inconsistent. Therefore, we have been unable to settle the construction expenses for last year.

We believe that the above errors of the Zhangjiakou Municipal People's Construction Company are serious. This is inseparable from the capitalist management thinking of the company's leading cadres. We suggest that the Zhangjiakou Municipal People's Government thoroughly investigate the company's work and help them correct their mistakes.

### 张家口市人民建筑公司资本主义经营思想严重

    张家口市人民建筑公司资本主义经营思想严重
    张家口制皮厂基本建设科杨书印来信：我厂的基本建设工程承包给张家口市地方国营人民建筑公司，在一九五二年十月初开始施工。不久，我们就发现该公司在施工时竟然采取了偷工减料等恶劣手段。如该公司让木工代替油工来铺屋顶的油毡，结果铺得歪斜不直，不合规格；同时他们又用臭油顶替油膏，以致在一般温度时就会溶化。房顶灰土质量低劣，铺得厚薄不匀，有的还曾发生松软现象。今年三月某日下了半小时的雪，房顶就漏水了。圈梁钢筋原设计为五根，施工时却被减为四根。此外，该公司因为所属灰厂存有大量白石灰，就不顾工程是否需要，一下购进了一千多万斤（价值十亿元），运到现场积压起来。
    我们将以上问题提出后，中共张家口市委会严肃批判了该公司这种错误做法，并决定把该工程改为交该公司代办。但是，该公司不认真纠正过去的错误，却又用消极不负责任的态度来对待工程建设。如使用工料及其它开支时随便乱付，仅一次采购原料时的运费就多支出二千余万元。现场管理十分混乱，返工、窝工的现象严重。该公司在报去年的建筑经费时，又采取了欺骗手段。如砖围墙抅缝实际完成五百八十五平方公尺，表内却报为一千一百二十八平方公尺；干燥间混凝土基实际完成九点二一立方公尺，表内却报为三十三立方公尺；铁筋实用五千八百余斤，表上却为七千一百四十二斤；烧丝实用二十九点二八斤，表上却为八十九斤……。而且他们几次报来的数字还前后不符。因此，我们也就根本无法结算出去年的建筑经费。
    我们认为：张家口市人民建筑公司上述错误是严重的。这是与该公司领导干部的资本主义经营思想分不开的。我们建议张家口市人民政府彻底检查该公司的工作，帮助他们改正错误。
