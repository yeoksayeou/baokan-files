To learn from the lessons of waste and lack of accountability in construction during 1952, which led to poor engineering quality, the Cangxian Special District Construction Company of Hebei Province, after starting cross-year projects and new projects this year, organized inspection teams to go deep into construction sites. By investigating quality, waste, and lack of accountability, they mobilized the masses to gradually establish a responsibility system.

The lack of a responsibility system during construction by the Cangxian Special District Construction Company, leading to a lack of accountability and poor engineering quality, was a very serious problem. At construction site number two, the building body was too uneven, requiring rework twice. When installing doors and windows at this site, the doors and windows for the office and dormitory were installed in the wrong places. Due to unclear division of labor and unclear responsibilities in the reconstruction project at construction site number one, the preliminary construction specifications stated eleven purlins per room, but the estimation personnel told the carpenters to install nine. The construction worker did not follow the specifications and installed nine. It was only discovered when the mud was applied. After this inspection, three places in the entire district's new projects were found to require partial rework.

The reasons for these serious situations, in addition to the lack of a clear responsibility system, unclear division of labor, and unclear responsibilities, were also a lack of ideological education. Some cadres, technicians, and workers lacked a sense of responsibility to the country and the people, and held a perfunctory attitude. For example, Gao Shanwen, the construction worker at the agricultural school construction site, found that the ash foundation was uneven. When the workers asked him what to do, Gao Shanwen said, "Just make it work!" The leadership was busy speeding up progress. Although they had proposed ensuring quality this year, there was no scientific on-site management method or system, which resulted in repeated poor quality and rework waste.

In order to fundamentally change the above situation, the Cangxian Special District Construction Company formed an inspection team in early May to work with various construction sites to mobilize workers to inspect poor quality, waste, and lack of accountability. They sought reasons, brainstormed solutions, and formulated various construction responsibility systems, and specifically clarified the responsibilities of the site director, construction worker, and material handler. To ensure the thorough implementation of the responsibility system, it was also stipulated that a quality responsibility registration book should be established with the construction site as a unit, and the inspection situation at the handover between shifts after each process was completed should be recorded in detail.

### 沧县专区建筑公司发动群众建立责任制

    沧县专区建筑公司发动群众建立责任制
    河北省沧县专区建筑公司为接受一九五二年施工中的浪费和无人负责的现象所造成的工程质量低劣等教训，于今年垮年度工程及新工程开工后即组织检查组深入工地通过查质量，查浪费，查无人负责的工作，发动群众逐步建立责任制。
    沧县专区建筑公司工地施工中缺乏责任制造成无人负责和工程质量低劣是一个很严重的问题。第二号工地因房身过于凹凸，返工两次。该工地安门窗时把办公室与宿舍的门窗都安错了。一号工地的改建工程由于分工不明，责任不清，预先与施工说明是每间房十一根檩，估算人员告诉木工安九根，施工员未按说明办事，即安九根，至上泥时才被发觉。全区新工程经过此次检查，已发现有三处必须部分返工。
    造成这些严重情况的原因，除了没有明确的责任制，分工不明，职责不清外，另一个原因是缺乏思想教育工作，部分干部，技术人员和工人缺乏对国家和人民负责的责任感，抱着得过且过的错误态度。如农业学校工地施工员高善文发现灰梗不平，工人问他应该怎么办，高善文说：“凑合上就行啦！”领导上则忙于赶进度，今年虽曾提出保证质量，但无一套科学的现场管理方法与制度，因而一再发生质量低劣和返工浪费。
    为了从根本上改变上述情况，沧县专区建筑公司五月初组成检查组配合各工地发动工人检查质量低劣、浪费、无人负责现象，找原因，想办法，制订了各种施工责任制，并特别明确规定了现场主任、施工员、材料员的责任。为保证责任制的彻底实行，又规定以工地为单位建立质量责任登记簿，将每一工序完后交接班时的检查情形作详细记载。
