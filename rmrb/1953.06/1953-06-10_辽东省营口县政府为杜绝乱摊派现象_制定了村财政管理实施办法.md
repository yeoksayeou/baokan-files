To eliminate the phenomenon of random apportionment, the Yingkou County Government in Liaoning Province has formulated village financial management implementation measures.

Village financial work in Yingkou County, Liaoning Province, has gradually eliminated the phenomenon of random apportionment because it basically implements the Liaoning Provincial Government’s implementation measures on village financial management. However, the development of village financial work in the county is extremely uneven, and can be roughly divided into the following types: 1. The district government's financial and grain assistant attaches importance to village financial work. Each village has established a village financial management committee. All apportionments and expenditures of the village government must be reviewed by the management committee and announced to the masses. The accounts and procedures are also sound. This type of village accounts for about 40% of the county. 2. The district government's financial and grain assistant is passive in his work, doing whatever is asked of him. Although he wants to manage village finances well, he lacks confidence and leadership support, so the village financial work is generally adequate. This type of village accounts for about 40% of the county. 3. The district financial and grain assistant has completely abandoned the management of village finances, resulting in financial chaos. Individual village financial and grain committee members have engaged in corruption.

The common problem with village financial work in Yingkou County is the issue of rural school construction. According to the number of students in the county in 1952, the school buildings are sufficient, and there are even surplus; however, schools in various villages generally require building houses. For example, the school buildings in Shifosi Village are already sufficient, but now seven more school buildings have been built. This year, the entire county needs more than 6 billion yuan just to repair school buildings, which increases the burden on the masses. Some schools have resorted to disguised apportionments to students. The school in Zengjiatun Village apportioned 2,500 yuan per student to buy sanitary equipment. Since the beginning of the school year, the school in Sujiabu Village has apportioned an average of 8,000 yuan per student to buy "bugles and drums." The Central Primary School in Lijia Village emphasizes uniform clothing and pays attention to formality, requiring students to pay for uniforms, forcing students who cannot afford the clothing to go home crying. In addition, the use of manpower and animal power in various villages is also extremely unreasonable. For example, the Sujiabu Village cooperative mobilized the masses' carts to transport cotton seeds, and cadres from various government departments casually dispatched large carts to carry luggage when they went to the countryside.

In view of the above situation, the Yingkou County People's Government, in order to reduce the burden on the masses, increase agricultural production income, and improve the people's lives, has formulated the Yingkou County Village Financial Management Implementation Measures in accordance with the instructions of the higher-level government and in light of the specific conditions of Yingkou County; and at the end of March, it convened a training class for district and village financial and grain cadres, summarized the village financial situation in Yingkou County in recent years, and stipulated the village-level annual budget. In order to implement the village financial management implementation measures, it was decided that:

1. No organ or group is allowed to apportion or disguise apportionment to anyone. Legal apportionments shall be implemented according to the annual budget; otherwise, the apportioned village or household, as well as individuals, have the right to refuse and suggest that the higher-level government investigate responsibility. Apportionments outside the budget that are beneficial to the broad masses of the people and are within the burden capacity of the masses shall be reported to the county for record after approval by the district if the apportionment is less than 500,000 yuan, and shall be reported to the county for approval after review by the district if the apportionment is 500,000 yuan or more.

2. All construction in the village must be budgeted and approved before construction can begin; otherwise, it will be considered a violation of financial discipline. The principle of various undertakings is that they must be conducive to agricultural production and the broad masses of the people, and should be handled in the spirit of thrift according to the economic capacity of the village. Those that can be done or not done should be postponed.

3. All finances in the village shall be uniformly controlled by the financial and grain committee member. All departments must go through the financial and grain committee member when using money. The mobilization of manpower and animal power shall be uniformly controlled by the civil affairs committee member, and the financial and grain committee member can specifically supervise.

    辽东省营口县政府为杜绝乱摊派现象
    制定了村财政管理实施办法
    辽东省营口县的村财政工作，由于基本上执行了辽东省政府关于村财政管理的实施办法，已逐步杜绝了乱摊派现象。但该县村财政工作发展极不平衡，大致可分为以下几种类型：一、区政府财粮助理员重视村财政工作。各村建立了村财政管理委员会，村政府的一切摊派、开支均需经过管理委员会的审查，并向群众公布，账目、手续也很健全。这类村约占全县的十分之四。二、区政府财粮助理员工作被动，有啥干啥，虽然也想把村财政管理好，但信心不大，领导也不支持，因而村财政工作一般化。这类村约占全县十分之四。三、区财粮助理员根本放弃了对村财政的管理，造成财政混乱现象。个别村财粮委员有贪污行为。
    目前营口县村财政工作普遍存在的问题是农村建校问题。根据一九五二年该县学生数，校舍是够用的，甚至还有多余；但各村学校普遍要求盖房子。如石佛寺村校舍已经够用，但现在又盖了七间校舍。今年全县光修校舍就需款六十余亿元，这就加重了群众负担。有的学校变相向学生摊派，曾家屯村学校中每个学生摊派二千五百元买卫生设备。宿家卜村学校今年开学以来，每个学生平均摊派八千元买 “鼓号”。李家村中心完全小学强调服装统一，讲究形式，要学生缴款做制服，逼得做不起服装的学生回家直哭。此外，各村在人力、畜力的使用上也极不合理，如宿家卜村合作社运棉花籽也动员群众的车，政府各部门干部下乡，也随便派大车拉行李等。
    根据上述情况，营口县人民政府为了减轻群众负担，增加农业生产收入，改善群众生活，特根据上级政府指示，结合营口县具体情况，制定了营口县村财政管理实施办法；并于三月底召集了区、村财粮干部训练班，总结了营口县几年来村财政情况，规定了村级年度预算，为了贯彻村财政管理实施办法，决定：
    一、任何机关、团体不准向任何人摊派和变相摊派。属于法定的摊派，按年度预算执行，否则被摊派村或户以及个人，有权拒绝，并建议上级政府追究责任。属于预算外的摊派，有利于广大人民，并根据群众负担的可能，以村为单位摊派不满五十万元者，经区批准报县备案，摊派五十万元以上者经区审查报县批准执行。
    二、村中的各项建设，必须造预算经批准后方能施工，否则以违犯财政纪律论。各项事业建设的原则，必须有利于农业生产和广大人民，并应根据本村经济能力，本着节约的精神办理，可办可不办的一律缓办。
    三、村中一切财政统一由财粮委员掌握，各部门凡动用钱时，必须通过财粮委员，动员人力、畜力时，统一由民政委员掌握，财粮委员可具体监督。
