    I Want to Train More Skilled Workers for the Motherland
    Peng Songfu, Delegate to the Second National Congress of the All-China Youth Federation, Model Worker of Kunming City
    I feel very honored to be able to attend the Second National Congress of the All-China Youth Federation.

    Our great motherland has begun its first Five-Year Plan this year, and all aspects are advancing rapidly. In these days of a happy life, I recall the suffering I endured as an apprentice. I entered the factory at the age of fourteen, and back then, I not only couldn't get enough to eat or wear, but I was also beaten and scolded. The master craftsmen were also very conservative and unwilling to teach anything, so apprentices couldn't learn any skills.

    In 1949, Yunnan was liberated, and the working people saw the light of day again. We, the working class, became masters of the country. Chairman Mao called on us to increase production to support the great struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea. I wondered how I could contribute all my strength. Last June, the leadership transferred me to the fitter section of the technical training class as an instructor, because I deeply understood the hardship of learning technology in the past, I was determined to teach the apprentices well. Late at night on June 26th, the fellow workers were all sound asleep. I sat quietly in my room, thinking about the report that the director had conveyed during the day regarding the national economic construction and our factory's future plans. When I thought of the motherland's happy and beautiful future, I was truly excited. I also remembered the scene of the flood engulfing the rice paddies when I traveled by boat from Luliang to Majie. The boatman said, "Every year when the rainy season comes, the river rises, and nothing can stop it." Why can't we control the river's flooding? Because industry is not yet developed. But to develop industry, we need many skilled workers. Thinking of this, I felt the weight of my responsibility.

    The factory started a quick literacy campaign. One day, Zhou Xiayuan, the director of the technical training class, asked me if technical skills could also be learned quickly. I thought: If the apprentices could all learn the skills quickly, that would be great! But literacy relies on memorization, while learning technical skills requires not only the brain but also craftsmanship. Quick learning might not be easy. But what is easy? What creation is easy? I thought that if I could teach the apprentices based on the spirit of Qi Jianhua's quick literacy method, the teaching efficiency would definitely improve. So, I decided to give it a try.

    From then on, I thought about this problem whenever I had time. I thought, if theory and practical operation were linked, and whatever was taught was immediately practiced, wouldn't the apprentices learn faster? One day, while walking on the road, I suddenly remembered teaching apprentices to recognize rulers in a short-term training class earlier in the year. I explained the "tricks" of recognizing rulers that I had figured out after six or seven years of experience, and they learned them quickly. Thinking of this, I secretly remembered a rule: theory must be combined with practice, teaching experience and "tricks."

    But there are so many operations in turning, where should I start teaching? The book "Introduction to the Experience of the Northeast Technical Spare-time Night School" inspired me. That book talked about how to learn technology by classifying, step-by-step, and with a plan. So, based on my ten years of technical experience, I systematically wrote teaching materials and identified key issues. Summarizing ten years of experience was not a simple task! In the past, many things were only remembered in my heart, and now it was not easy to recall them bit by bit. I thought during the day, I thought at night, I even thought about it while eating and dreaming; every day before dawn, I would get up, and sometimes I couldn't sleep until two or three in the morning. My wife saw that I hadn't had a haircut for over a month and asked me what I was thinking about. I said, "I'm rushing to make a quick teaching plan for lathe technology, preparing to teach apprentices well in three months." My wife didn't quite believe it and said, "In the past, it took three years to become a qualified apprentice, how can you teach apprentices well in three months?" I retorted, "Why are you still comparing the past with today? Tell me, why was my father-in-law able to get land?" At this point, she understood.

    In this process, I consulted and researched with Zhou Xiayuan, the director of the training class. He is a Communist Party member and also an old lathe worker. Guo Shaochuan, the party branch secretary and director of the factory, learned about my plan and talked to me, encouraging me to try it boldly; and repeatedly instructed Lao Zhou to find ways to help me in all aspects; and also sent technician Zhang Xueming to specifically help me organize the teaching materials. In this way, with the support of the Party and the help of comrades, the "Quick Teaching Method of Basic Lathe Technology" was finally successfully implemented.

    Apprentices taught in three months using the "Quick Teaching Method of Basic Lathe Technology" can learn the technology that they could only learn in the past three years. After graduation, in terms of theory, they are equivalent to fifth-grade workers, and in terms of practical operation, they can reach the level of third-grade workers. Some of the first graduating apprentices have overfulfilled their production tasks and have been awarded the glorious red flag. Under my influence, fitters, foundry workers, patternmakers, etc. in the technical training class have also broken with conservative ideas and summarized their own advanced experiences.

    In order to create a beautiful and happy future, we young workers must further strengthen our political and cultural studies; better learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, and improve our technical level.

### 我要为祖国培养更多的技术工人

    我要为祖国培养更多的技术工人
    中华全国青年第二次代表大会代表  昆明市劳动模范  彭松福
    我这次能参加中华全国青年第二次代表大会，感觉非常的荣幸。
    我们伟大的祖国今年开始了第一个五年计划，各个方面都在迅速地前进着。在幸福生活的日子里，我回想到过去当学徒时所受的痛苦。我十四岁就进入工厂，那时候不但吃不饱、穿不暖，还要挨打受骂。老师傅又非常保守，什么也不肯教，做学徒的是学不到什么技术的。
    一九四九年云南解放了，劳动人民重见了天日，我们工人阶级做了国家的主人。毛主席号召我们增加生产，以支持伟大的抗美援朝斗争。我就想，怎样把自己的一切力量贡献出来呢？去年六月，领导方面调我到技工训练班车工部作指导员，因为我深深体会到过去学技术的苦，我就决心把学徒们教好。六月二十六日深夜，工友们都已睡熟了。我自个儿静静地坐在房里，想着白天里主任所传达的关于国家经济建设和我们厂子今后计划的报告。当我想到祖国幸福的、美丽的远景时，心里真是兴奋极了。我又想起从陆良乘船到马街时，看见大水淹没稻田的那幅情景。船家说：“每年雨季一来，河水一涨，堵也堵不住。”为什么我们还治不了这条河的泛滥呢？因为工业还不发达呀。可是要发展工业，就得有很多技术工人。想到这儿，我就感到自己责任的重大。
    厂子里搞速成识字学习了。有一天，技工训练班主任周霞远对我说，学技术是不是也可以速成呢？我就想：如果学徒们都能很快地学会技术，那该多好啊！但识字是凭脑子记，学技术，不光要靠脑子，还要靠手艺，要速成恐怕不容易。可是，什么事情容易呢？那一件创造是容易的呢？我想如果能根据祁建华的速成识字法的精神去教学徒，教学效率一定会提高。我就下决心来试试看。
    从此以后，我一有空就想着这个问题。我想到，要是理论和实际操作联系起来，教什么就实习什么，那学徒不就学得更快了吗？有一天我走在路上，忽然想起年前在短期训练班教学徒认尺子的事，我把自己摸了六、七年才摸到的认尺子的“窍门”讲给学徒听，他们很快就学会了。想到这里，我心里暗暗地记住了一条：理论要和实际结合起来，就是教经验，教“窍门”。
    但是车工的操作那么多，究竟从何教起呢？“东北技术业余夜校经验介绍”一书启发了我。那本书里谈到如何分门别类、有步骤、有计划地学技术的方法。于是我根据自己十年来的技术经验，系统地写出教材，找出关键问题。总结十年的经验，可不是一件简单的事！过去好些东西都只凭心记，现在一点一滴地去回想，真不容易。白天想，晚上想，连吃饭作梦都在想；每天天不亮，我就起来，有时到夜里两、三点钟还睡不着。老婆看我一个多月没理发，就问我到底在想些什么？我说：“在赶作一个车工技术速成教学计划，准备在三个月里面就教会学徒。”老婆有些不相信地说：“过去出师要三年，你怎么能在三个月里就把学徒教好？”我反问她：“你怎么还拿过去和今天比？你说，今天老丈人为什么能分到田地呢？”这一下，她可也就想通了。
    在这个过程中，我曾找训练班主任周霞远商量、研究。他是共产党员，也是个老车工。厂子里的党支部书记、厂长郭少川知道了我的计划后，就找我谈话，鼓励我大胆试行；并好几次指示老周设法从各方面帮助我；还派了技术人员张学明具体地帮助我整理教材。这样，在党的支持和同志们的帮助下，“车工基本技术速成教学法”终于试行成功了。
    用“车工基本技术速成教学法”在三个月里面教出来的学徒，能够学到过去三年当中才能学到的技术。他们毕业后，在理论方面，相当于五级工，在实际操作方面，能达到三级工的水平。第一期毕业学徒，有的已超额完成生产任务，得到了光荣的红旗。在我的影响下，技工训练班的钳工、铸工、木型工等，也都打破了保守思想，总结了自己的先进经验。
    为了创造美满、幸福的未来，我们青年工人要进一步加强政治、文化学习；更好地学习苏联先进经验，提高自己的技术水平。
