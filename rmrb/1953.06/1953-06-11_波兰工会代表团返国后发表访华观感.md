Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, June 5th: The Polish trade union delegation that participated in the "May Day" International Labor Day parade and the Seventh All-China Congress of Trade Unions in Beijing this year returned to Warsaw in early June. The head of the delegation, P. Wojtas, Vice-Chairman of the Central Council of Polish Trade Unions, told a Polish News Agency reporter about his impressions of visiting China: The most profound impression of China on the Polish trade union delegation was the ideological and political unity of the Chinese people, their ardent love for the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong, and their high degree of enthusiasm in striving to build a new China. The second impression is almost as profound as the above, and that is the huge scale of China's construction and the astonishing speed of development in all aspects of Chinese life. Wojtas listed many vivid examples related to China's industrial, agricultural, and cultural construction to illustrate this point. Wojtas concluded by saying: I would like to emphasize the high degree of enthusiasm and generous hospitality the Chinese people showed us. Throughout our visit to China, in every place we visited, we saw many proofs of Sino-Polish friendship. We left China with great admiration for the great Chinese people, and we were very happy about the achievements they have made, which are also the achievements of the entire great camp of peace and progress.

    波兰工会代表团返国后发表访华观感
    【新华社七日讯】据波兰通讯社华沙五日讯：今年在北京参加庆祝“五一”国际劳动节游行大会和中国工会第七次全国代表大会的波兰工会代表团，已在六月初返抵华沙。代表团团长、波兰工会中央理事会副主席帕·沃雅斯对波兰通讯社记者发表访问中国的观感说：波兰工会代表团对中国的最深刻的印象就是：中国人民在思想上和政治上的团结一致，他们对于中国共产党和毛泽东主席的热烈爱戴，和他们努力建设新中国的高度热情。第二个印象几乎和上述印象一样深刻，这便是中国建设的巨大规模和中国各方面生活发展的惊人速度。沃雅斯列举了许多有关中国工业、农业和文化建设的生动事例加以说明。沃雅斯最后说：我愿意强调中国人民对待我们的高度热情和给我们的优厚款待。我们在访问中国的全部时间里，在我们访问过的一切地方，都看到了许许多多中波友好的证明。我们离开了中国，我们很佩服伟大的中国人民，我们对他们所获得的成就、也就是整个伟大的和平与进步阵营的成就，感到非常欢欣。
