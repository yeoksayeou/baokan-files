    Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, June 21st: (Special Correspondent Jiang Nan) The Syngman Rhee gang's actions of forcibly detaining prisoners of war have become even more rampant. On the night of the 20th, they even dispatched a special task force with tanks and trucks to the Shangwutai prisoner-of-war camp and took away more than 400 prisoners of war. This prisoner-of-war camp was guarded by the US military, but the US military watched as the prisoners of war were loaded onto trucks and transported away without taking any action to stop them. On the evening of the 20th and the morning of the 21st, in Shangwutai and three other prisoner-of-war camps, the Syngman Rhee gang, with the tacit approval of the US side, forcibly took away more than 600 prisoners of war.
    According to Reuters, a spokesman for Syngman Rhee's Ministry of National Defense said that the prisoners of war who have been forcibly detained will be incorporated into the South Korean armed forces. According to the Associated Press, the prisoners of war who were taken from the Shangwutai prisoner-of-war camp by the Syngman Rhee gang on the 18th have already been serving in the nearby Gwangju Rhee's army training base.
    For four consecutive days, the Syngman Rhee gang has been taking away tens of thousands of prisoners of war in front of the Americans and incorporating them into Rhee's puppet army. At the same time, Won Yong-duk, commander of the South Korean constabulary, announced that the South Korean constabulary will "spare no effort" to "release" all North Korean prisoners of war who are not directly repatriated. Byun Young-tae, acting prime minister of the South Korean government, also published a letter he wrote to Clark on the 18th, in which he said that he would "release" all North Korean prisoners of war who are not directly repatriated in a "manner that will not cause trouble."
    Judging from the situation in the past four days, the US side has been conniving with the Syngman Rhee gang to undermine the agreement, neither pursuing the prisoners of war who have been taken away, nor being responsible for guarding the prisoners of war still remaining in the prisoner-of-war camps, and turning a blind eye to Syngman Rhee's reckless actions. Does the US government believe that its responsibility is to let the Syngman Rhee gang take away all the prisoners of war?

### 李承晚强迫扣留战俘的行动更加嚣张  又在尚武台等地强迫扣留战俘六百多人

    李承晚强迫扣留战俘的行动更加嚣张
    又在尚武台等地强迫扣留战俘六百多人
    【新华社开城二十一日电】本社特派记者江南报道：李承晚匪帮强迫扣留战俘的行动更加嚣张了。在二十日夜，他们竟然出动了一支有着坦克和卡车的特遣部队，到尚武台战俘营又押走四百多名战俘。这个战俘营是美军看守的，但美军竟看着战俘被押上卡车运走，并没有加以任何制止。在二十日晚上和二十一日早上，在尚武台及其他三个战俘营，李承晚匪帮又在美方默许之下共强迫押走了六百多名战俘。
    据路透社报道说，李承晚的国防部的一个发言人说，已经被强迫扣留的战俘将被编进南朝鲜的武装部队中去。据美联社报道，被李承晚匪帮在十八日从尚武台战俘营拉走的战俘，已经在附近的光州李伪军训练基地中服役了。
    李承晚匪帮接连四天在美国人面前押走成千上万的战俘并把他们编入李伪军中去，同时，南朝鲜宪兵司令元容德宣布，南朝鲜的宪兵将“不惜任何代价”来“释放”所有不直接遣返的北朝鲜战俘。南朝鲜政府的代理总理卞荣泰也发表了他在十八日给克拉克的一封信，信里说，他要用“不会引起麻烦的方式”将所有不直接遣返的北朝鲜战俘“全部释放”。
    从接连四天的情形看来，美方一直纵容李承晚匪帮破坏协议，对已被押走的战俘也不去追回来，对尚留在战俘营中的战俘也不负责看守，对李承晚的胡作非为听之任之。美国政府是不是认为，它的责任是让李承晚匪帮押走所有战俘呢？
