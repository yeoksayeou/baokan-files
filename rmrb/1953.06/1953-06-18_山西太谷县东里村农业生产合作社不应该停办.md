    The Dongli Village Agricultural Production Cooperative in Taigu County, Shanxi Province, should not be shut down
    Zhao Xianbin
    In order to understand the implementation of the "Resolution on Agricultural Production Mutual Aid and Cooperation" and the "Instructions on Spring Plowing Production to Party Committees at All Levels" of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China in rural areas, I conducted an investigation and visited several villages in Taigu County, Shanxi Province, in early May. In these villages, the "leftist" rash advance tendency in the mutual aid and cooperation movement has been corrected. However, some cadres, in correcting the rash advance tendency, did not proceed from specific circumstances, and produced a rightist tendency. The closure of the Dongli Village Agricultural Production Cooperative in the Fifth District reflects such a problem. This cooperative should have only been reorganized and reduced in size, but the county and district cadres shut it down.
    The Dongli Village Agricultural Production Cooperative was formed after the wheat harvest last year by eleven active households from four mutual aid teams. Nine of these eleven households were poor and hired peasants before the land reform. In 1949, they united to overthrow the landlord and were allocated some houses, land, and scattered farm tools, but they all lacked the necessary farm tools and livestock. In order to overcome the difficulties in developing production, they organized mutual aid teams. At the beginning of the establishment of the mutual aid team, several of them, because they were too poor before the land reform and had not married, divided into two groups to eat and farm together after the land reform, as they could only take care of either their families or their fields when engaged in production. They urgently demanded mutual aid, and the mutual aid teams have always produced very well over the years.
    After three years of mutual aid, the production of all eleven households has developed. After the wheat harvest last year, they had a total of 271 mu of land, 7.5 livestock, and each family had half a set of farm tools. At this time, they all felt that mutual aid in the original way could not further develop production: land suitable for planting corn could not all be planted with corn, and land suitable for planting sorghum could not all be planted with sorghum. They also felt that it was difficult to raise livestock separately. The capital accumulation of each household after the land reform was still very small, and they could not afford good livestock; even if they could afford it, they could not afford to feed it or use it. Therefore, they only bought some old and weak livestock. They urgently felt the need to exchange and jointly use livestock. They felt that it was also difficult for each household to buy large farm tools (such as plows and harrows); even if they could afford it, they could not use it themselves; it was unreasonable for one family to pay for it and everyone to use it. Therefore, they requested to jointly buy large farm tools. Because these problems needed to be solved, they proposed the establishment of an agricultural production cooperative after the wheat harvest. At that time, the county and district leaders did not see the enthusiasm and rationality of this request, and did not approve their establishment of a cooperative, but they secretly established a cooperative. They had no new methods, so they implemented cooperative production according to the old method of jointly renting the landlord's land (that is, land, livestock, and tools are used as shares for rent, and labor is divided into dividends). Because they implemented the old method, the district cadres warned them after discovering it, saying: "We are not responsible if it is not run well." However, despite the fact that the district cadres were not responsible, they still succeeded in running it. Last year, their high-yield sorghum yielded 927 jin and 10 liang per mu, and the average yield of sorghum in the entire cooperative was 508 jin per mu. The average yield exceeded one and a half times that of the mutual aid team. The average yield of upland cotton was 157 jin and 4 liang per mu (the average yield of the mutual aid team was only 50 jin per mu). In addition, they also bought large farm tools and replaced weak livestock with good livestock. The cooperative members were very satisfied. In the fall, they were rated as a high-yield team by the special district. However, the county and district leaders still stubbornly refused to recognize this cooperative, which had actually been successfully run. It was not until they proposed the establishment of an agricultural production cooperative again last winter that the county and district leaders approved it, and the cooperative director Ren Erhuo was transferred to the special district to receive cooperative training.
    When formally establishing the cooperative, the county and district cadres did not proceed from the needs of developing production, but mechanically stipulated that the establishment of a cooperative must have more than 20 households. In order to gain the recognition of the county and district cadres, the backbone members of the cooperative did not consider whether their cooperative needed to be expanded, nor did they consider what kind of people should be absorbed if it needed to be expanded in order to run the cooperative well, so they confusedly absorbed fourteen new members into the cooperative. From then on, the cooperative was in crisis. The absorption of new members into the cooperative was aimless, but the people who requested to join had various motivations. To sum up, the fourteen households who were absorbed had the following three different plans when joining the cooperative: (1) More labor and less land, hoping to do more work and receive more dividends after joining the cooperative; (2) They lacked fertilizer, and the cooperative had a lot of fertilizer, hoping to apply more fertilizer from the cooperative and divide more grain; (3) They did not have farm tools and livestock (some even did not have a hoe), hoping to use the cooperative's draft animals and farm tools after joining the cooperative. As a result, a series of difficult problems arose within the cooperative: (1) More labor and less land, with no way out for the surplus labor. Each person in this village can cultivate an average of 40 mu of land. Before the absorption of new members, each member cultivated an average of 36 mu of land (because there was not enough land, they jointly rented 90 mu of land from households without labor), which was neither tight nor loose and very suitable. After the new members joined the cooperative, each person cultivated an average of only 28 mu, so a large amount of labor was surplus. These surplus laborers had no way to be arranged, so they had to dig up tomb bricks (tomb bricks sold by old tomb owners) and sweep road soil (for fertilizer). Under these circumstances, the old members felt that after the new members joined the cooperative, they did less work, and they were afraid that they would not be able to divide much grain in the fall, so they were not satisfied with the new members joining the cooperative. (2) The old members had a lot of fertilizer, with an average of 30 dan per mu; the new members brought less fertilizer, with an average of only 15 dan per mu. The old members proposed to buy fine fertilizer to make up for it, but the new members were afraid of spending too much money and not being able to divide grain in the fall, so they disagreed. The old members felt that the new members could not increase production after joining, and they were not satisfied. (3) The old members had more public accumulation of tools and livestock, worth a total of 22,964,600 yuan, while the new members had fewer tools and livestock, worth only 7,716,150 yuan. In addition, the evaluation of livestock and farm tools when they were converted into shares was low. The old members calculated that they lost 8,400 jin of millet and felt that they had suffered a loss. Therefore, the old members requested to increase the price of livestock and tools used as shares, and requested to withdraw some of the items. The new members saw that there was no profit to be made after joining the cooperative, so they were not active in labor. The new members and the old members were divided into two factions and blamed each other. The old members said that the new members were "opportunists," and the new members said that the old members were "selfish and self-interested." The responsible cadres of the cooperative were mostly old members, and their economic interests were consistent with those of the old members, so they naturally formed a united front with the old members. Therefore, they were also considered by the new members to be "selfish and self-interested, and not leading well." In this way, the cooperative fell into a state of disunity and chaos.
    From these facts, it is clear that the reason why the cooperative fell into a chaotic state was because the production bases and production requirements of the new and old members were inconsistent, and the mutual benefit between them could not be resolved. The root cause of this problem was an over-hasty advance, and a large number of new members were inappropriately developed all at once. Since this is the case, then in helping the cooperative to rectify, different treatments should be given to the different requirements of the new and old members. However, when the county and district cadres of Taigu County went to this village in April this year to correct the tendency of blind rash advance, they did not study the fundamental reasons for these problems, but only saw that the cooperative had many problems, and said that both the new and old members were "selfish and self-interested," and determined that the cadres in the cooperative were incapable of solving these problems and did not have the conditions to run the cooperative, so they forcibly ordered the cooperative to be shut down.
    The county and district cadres let the cooperative be divided into two mutual aid teams, but the old members could not understand the situation. When I went to visit this village, Su Wenjin, the secretary of the Communist Youth League District Working Committee who helped build the cooperative there, and Ren Erhuo, the original director of the cooperative, sighed and said: "It is a pity that this cooperative was shut down." Although the cooperative was shut down, their public accumulation has not yet been separated, and the members are still waiting and longing for the good life of cooperative production last year. They hope that the county and district leading organs will allow them to run the cooperative on the original basis and express their full confidence in running the cooperative well.
    The request of the old members is correct. I believe that the Taigu County Party Committee should allow them to restore the old cooperative and help them improve their management and adapt to their requirements for further development of production. Otherwise, the party and government leaders of Taigu County will be in danger of deviating from this part of the active masses and will not be able to correctly implement the mutual aid and cooperation policy of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. The main reason for this error in the work of correcting the "leftist" rash advance tendency by the Taigu County Party Committee is that they neither deeply studied the actual situation nor lacked a comprehensive policy perspective. They do not understand that if they blindly advance without proceeding from the production needs of the masses, it will indeed affect the production enthusiasm of the masses; but if they ignore the requirements of the masses for developing production and do not actively lead them forward, it will also dampen the production enthusiasm of the masses. The Taigu County Party Committee should deeply understand the spirit of "active leadership and steady advancement" in the mutual aid and cooperation policy, and in the work of correcting the "leftist" tendency, deeply study the actual situation, solve problems from the production needs of the masses, and prevent the occurrence of rightist tendencies.

    山西太谷县东里村农业生产合作社不应该停办
    赵宪斌
    为了了解农村中执行中共中央“关于农业生产互助合作的决议”和“关于春耕生产给各级党委的指示”的情况，我于五月初旬到山西太谷县的几个村庄进行了调查访问。在这几个村子里，互助合作运动中的“左”倾冒进偏向已经纠正。但有些干部在纠正冒进偏向中，不从具体情况出发，又产生了右的倾向。五区东里村农业生产合作社的停办，就反映了这样一个问题。这个合作社本来只应该加以整顿缩小，但县、区干部却把它停办了。
    东里村农业生产合作社是去年麦收后由四个互助组的十一户积极分子组成的。这十一户中有九户是土地改革前的贫雇农。他们在一九四九年联合斗倒地主，分到了一些房屋土地和零碎农具，但都缺乏必需的农具和牲畜。为了克服发展生产的困难，他们便组织了互助组。在互助组成立之初，他们中间有几户因为在土地改革前过于贫苦，没有结婚，在土地改革后进行生产时，顾了家里就顾不了地里，曾分成两摊伙吃饭、伙种地。他们迫切地要求互助，在互助组历年来都生产得很好。
    经过三年互助，十一户的生产都发展了。去年麦收后，他们共有土地二百七十一亩，七头半牲畜，各家都有了半套农具。这时，他们都感到照原来的样子互助不能更进一步发展生产：种玉茭合适的地，不能全种玉茭，种高粱合适的地，也不能全种成高粱。对于单独喂养牲畜，他们感到也有困难。土地改革后各户的资金积累得还很少，买不起好牲畜；即便买得起也喂不起、用不开。因此，他们都只买了些老弱牲畜。他们迫切感觉到有调换、伙用牲口的必要。他们感到各户自买大农具（如犁、耙等）也很困难；即使能买得起，自己也用不开；一家出钱大家伙用又不合理。因此，他们要求伙买大农具。由于以上这些问题需要解决，他们在麦收后就提出了组织农业生产合作社的要求。当时县区领导方面并未看到这个要求的积极性和合理性，没有批准他们办社，但他们暗地里却办起社来了。他们没有新的办法，就按过去合伙租种地主土地的办法（即土地、牲畜、工具入股分租，劳力分红的办法），实行了合作生产。因为他们实行的是老办法，区干部发觉后曾警告他们说：“办坏了我们不负责任。”可是，尽管区干部不负责任，他们还是办成功了。去年他们的丰产高粱每亩收了九百二十七斤十两，全社高粱每亩平均收了五百零八斤。平均产量超过了互助组时的一倍半。旱地棉花每亩平均收了一百五十七斤四两（互助组时每亩平均只收五十余斤）。另外，他们还买了大农具，把弱牲口换成了好牲口。社员十分满意。秋后，被专区评为丰产组。但是，县区领导干部对于这个实际上已经办成功的合作社，仍然固执地不承认它。一直到去冬他们再提出成立农业生产合作社时，县区领导才批准了，并把社长任二货调到专区去受了合作训练。
    在正式建社的时候，县区干部不从发展生产的需要出发，机械地规定成立合作社必须在二十户以上。社内的骨干分子为了取得县区干部的承认，没有考虑他们的合作社是否需要扩大，也没有考虑如果需要扩大应该吸收一些什么人进来，才能把社办好，便糊里糊涂地吸收了十四户新社员入了社。从此这个社便伏下了危机。合作社吸收新社员是无目的的，但要求入社的人却有各种不同的动机。归纳起来，这十四户被吸收的人在入社时有这样三种不同的打算：（一）劳力多土地少，希望入社后多做工，多分红；（二）自己缺肥料，社里肥料多，希望多施社里的肥料多分粮；（三）自己没有农具、牲畜（有的少到连个镐头也没有），希望入社后使用社的耕畜农具。这样，就使社内发生了一连串难以解决的问题：（一）劳力多土地少，剩余劳力没出路。这个村每人平均能耕种四十亩地，没有吸收新社员以前，每个社员平均耕种三十六亩土地（因地不够种，他们共同租入无劳力户土地九十亩），不紧不忙很合适。新社员入社后，每人平均只耕种二十八亩，于是剩余了大量劳力。这些剩余劳力无法安排，只好去刨丧砖（老墓主卖的墓砖），扫道土（做肥料用）。在这种情况下，老社员觉得新社员入社后，自己做的活少了，怕秋后分不到多少粮食，因此对新社员入社不满意。（二）老社员的肥料多，原来每亩地平均可上到三十担；新社员带的肥料少，平均每亩只能上到十五担。老社员提出买细肥补救，新社员怕花钱多了秋后分不到粮食，不同意买。老社员感到新社员进来后不能增产了，又不满意。（三）老社员公共积累的工具、牲畜多，共值二千二百九十六万四千六百元，新社员工具牲畜少，只值七百七十一万六千一百五十元，加上牲畜农具折价入股时评价低，老社员算来赔了八千四百斤小米，感到吃了亏。因此，老社员要求提高牲畜工具入股的价格，并要求抽出一部分东西。新社员见到入社后无利可图，劳动便不积极了。新社员和老社员分成了两派，互相埋怨。老社员说新社员是“投机分子”，新社员说老社员“自私自利”。社的负责干部大都是老社员，在经济利益上和老社员是一致的，也很自然地和老社员连成一气了。因此，他们也被新社员认为“自私自利，领导的不好”。这样一来，这个社就陷入了不团结的混乱状态。
    从这些事实看来，很显然的，这个社陷入混乱状态的原因，是由于新老社员的生产基础和生产要求不一致，他们之间的互利问题无法解决。产生这个问题的根源是冒进了一步，不适当地一下子就发展了一大批新社员。既然如此，那么在帮助这个社进行整顿时，就应该针对新老社员之间的不同要求来作不同的处理。但太谷县的县、区干部在今年四月间到这个村去纠正盲目冒进偏向时，不去研究这些问题的根本原因，只是看到这个社的问题很多，便说新老社员都“自私自利”，认定社内干部无能力解决这些问题，不具备办社条件，便强令这个社停办了。
    县区干部让这个合作社分成了两个互助组，但老社员思想搞不通。当我到这个村去访问时，在那里帮助建社的青年团区工委书记粟文近和原来的社长任二货唉声叹气地说：“这个社停办了太可惜。”社虽停办了，他们的公共积累仍未分开，社员们都还在徬徨等待，留恋于去年合作生产的好生活。他们希望县区领导机关允许他们仍在原有的基础上办社，并表示有十足的信心把社办好。
    老社员的这种要求是正确的。我认为太谷县委应该让他们把老社恢复起来，并帮助他们改善经营管理，以适应他们进一步发展生产的要求。不然，太谷县的党政领导就有脱离这一部分积极的群众的危险，就不能正确地贯彻中共中央的互助合作政策。太谷县委在纠正“左”倾冒进偏向的工作中发生这种错误的主要原因，是他们既未深入研究实际情况，又缺乏全面的政策观点。他们不了解如果不从群众的生产需要出发而盲目冒进，固然会影响群众的生产积极性；但不顾群众发展生产的要求，不积极领导他们前进，也会挫伤群众的生产积极性。太谷县委应深刻体会互助合作政策中“积极领导，稳步前进”的精神，在纠正“左”倾偏向的工作中，深入研究实际情况，从群众的生产需要出发去解决问题，防止右倾偏向的发生。
