The remarkable achievements we have seen during our visit clearly demonstrate the rapid development of China's national economy and the continuous improvement of the people's living standards.

At the same time, they are eagerly learning culture, and they are now in a position to meet their own cultural needs on an increasingly wider scale. Cultural centers have been established everywhere in the country, and the broad working people regularly participate in the activities of the cultural centers near them with great interest.
