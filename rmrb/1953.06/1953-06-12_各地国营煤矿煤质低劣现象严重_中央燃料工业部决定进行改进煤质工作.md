    Serious Low Coal Quality in State-Owned Coal Mines Across the Country
    Central Fuel Industry Ministry Decides to Improve Coal Quality
    [By Our Newspaper] The increasingly low quality of coal produced by state-owned coal mines in Northeast China, North China, East China and other regions has greatly affected industrial production and transportation, and caused much loss of state wealth.
    The inspection team of the Central People's Government's Ministry of Fuel Industry and the Coal Mine Management Bureau recently inspected the production situation of state-owned coal mines in various regions and found that the phenomenon of low coal quality in various coal mines is more serious than in the past, and the amount of gangue, ash, and other impurities mixed in the coal has increased significantly. According to incomplete statistics from the Coal Mine Management Bureau, in the first quarter of this year, state-owned coal mines in various regions transported a total of 100,8498 tons of stone mixed in the coal. For example, the mixed coal transported from Kailuan Coal Mine to Tianjin contained as much as 20 percent gangue. In March, the coal transported from the Xi'an Coal Mine to a factory of the Second Ministry of Machinery Industry contained 50 to 60 percent gangue, and as a result, it had to compensate 60 tons of coal. In the first quarter of this year, the average ash content of coal transported out of Jiulonggang, Huainan increased by 2.4 percent compared with last year. The ash content of coal sold out of Caijiagang, Huainan in January this year increased by an average of 4.93 percent compared with last year. In April, the highest ash content of coal produced by the Shirren Coal Mine in Tonghua reached 40 percent, and the ash content of Guanshan Coal in Beipiao had exceeded 40 percent by mid-March.
    The low coal quality has greatly affected industrial production and transportation. Because gangue and ash themselves cannot burn, and they obstruct the air circulation in the furnace and weaken the heat, which affects the quality of products and increases the scrap rate. For example, if the ash content of coke used for ironmaking increases by 1 percent, an iron furnace will use 2 to 2.3 percent more coke, and the consumption of limestone will increase by 4 percent, and the capacity of the iron furnace will also be weakened. Therefore, the increase in ash content of coal will cause many losses in industrial production. For example, the Zhonghui Glass Factory can produce good glass in four hours with 10 tons of pure coal; if inferior coal is used, it will not only take 12 tons and cost five hours, but also the product will not be thoroughly burned within the specified time, the color will be unclear, and the scrap rate will reach 10 percent. A brick kiln in Tongxian County, Hebei Province, burned more than 10,000 bricks because the fire was too weak when burning inferior coal. Many factories such as Hangu factories and Chadian Paper Mill have also suffered production losses due to the low coal quality. The low coal quality has also caused many accidents in power plants and railway transportation. The Qiqihar Railway Bureau had twelve delays in April due to the use of inferior coal from Hengshan and Hegang in Jixi. Because Hengshan coal has too much ash content, when the train added coal, a large number of sparks spewed out of the chimney, resulting in a fire in the forest area. The Zhengzhou Railway Bureau and the Xuzhou Railway Bureau delayed the speed of the train and affected the entire locomotive turnaround time due to the use of inferior coal from the Jiawang Coal Mine. The development of the competition movement on the railway was hindered, causing great political and economic losses. The two railway bureaus once refused to use the coal from Jiawang Coal Mine. The power plant of the Xuzhou Electric Power Bureau also adopted the inferior coal of Jiawang Coal Mine. The calorific value of the coal dropped from an average of 600 kilocalories (unit of calorific value) per kilogram in the past to about 500 kilocalories, which increased the cost of power generation and affected the normal operation of production.
    The phenomenon of low coal quality has also caused a very bad impact among the masses. Many users demand returns because the coal is not good, and a large amount of coal cannot be sold. Taozhuang Coal Mine did not remove the natural coke from the coal, and even mixed explosives such as detonators and explosives, which caused a tragedy. An old woman named Kong in Xuzhou and a blacksmith named Xing in Yixing, Jiangsu were blinded by the explosions.
    Low coal quality has wasted a large amount of national wealth. According to incomplete statistics from the Coal Mine Management Bureau, the increase in gangue and ash in the coal produced by state-owned coal mines in various regions in the first quarter wasted 13 billion yuan in train transportation costs. From January to April this year, China Coal Industry Building Materials Company wasted a total of more than 10 billion yuan in freight and funds for purchasing these gangue due to the large amount of gangue mixed in the coal transported out. At the same time, because of the low coal quality, users do not pick up the goods, and many coal mines have accumulated a large amount of coal. From October last year to March this year, the backlog of coal in Hongshan Coal Mine increased from more than 12,000 tons to more than 128,000 tons, making it difficult for funds to circulate and unable to pay wages in time, and the longer the coal is backlogged, the lower the quality.
    The main reason for the increasingly low coal quality is that the leading cadres of coal mines in various regions generally have a one-sided idea of pursuing output and neglecting quality. For example, according to the correct calculation of Soviet experts, a working face of Sanshan Well in Hongshan, Shandong can only mine 200 tons of coal; however, their coal mining plan is 300 tons, and the extra 100 tons is gangue. Even more serious is that Duan Keming, the coal mining team leader of Jiulonggang Mine in Huainan, openly crushed the gangue and mixed it into the coal. After the inspection team sampled a car of coal, it was found that 30 percent of it was gangue. On March 31, a car of coal in Datong Mine was found to have good coal on the top and most of it was gangue on the bottom. Chen Yaode, the director of the Datai Mine of the Jingxi Coal Mine, even mixed 1,500 tons of coal that had been mined in 1950, had completely deteriorated, and had a lot of gangue into the Tangjiadi coal pile. In April of this year, he mixed another 4,000 to 5,000 tons of old coal that had deteriorated. The coal in Datai Mine was not good in the first place, so it became even worse. China Coal Industry Building Materials Company had to stop shipping it, which seriously affected production. Due to the one-sided task view of the leadership, the education of employees is very poor, and there is no strict product acceptance system, resulting in a situation where no one is responsible for the quality.
    In response to the above situation, the Central Fuel Industry Ministry recently held a meeting, inviting representatives from the Central Ministry of Commerce, China Coal Industry Building Materials Company, and major users to participate. The meeting reviewed the coal quality of coal mines in various regions and decided to improve the coal quality in coal mines in various regions in the near future.

    各地国营煤矿煤质低劣现象严重
    中央燃料工业部决定进行改进煤质工作
    【本报讯】东北、华北、华东等地国营煤矿产煤质量日益低劣，使工业生产和交通运输受到很大影响，国家财富遭受了许多损失。
    中央人民政府燃料工业部和煤矿管理总局检查组最近检查了各地国营煤矿的生产情况，发现各地煤矿煤质低劣的现象比过去更严重，煤里夹杂的不能燃烧的矸石、灰分和其他杂物大量增加。据煤矿管理总局的不完全统计，今年第一季度各地国营煤矿运出的煤中，共夹杂了石头十万零八千四百九十八吨。如开滦煤矿运往天津的统煤中，有的竟含有百分之二十的矸石。三月间西安煤矿运给第二机械工业部某厂的煤中，竟有百分之五十到六十的矸石，结果只好赔偿煤六十吨。淮南九龙岗今年第一季度外运煤中平均含灰分较去年增加百分之二点四，淮南蔡家岗今年一月外销煤中的灰分比去年平均增加百分之四点九三。通化石人煤矿四月份所产煤中，最高的含灰分达百分之四十，北票冠山煤在三月中旬含灰分已超过百分之四十。
    煤质低劣使工业生产和交通运输受到很大影响。因为矸石和灰分本身不能燃烧，并且障碍炉内的空气流通，减弱热度，这就影响产品的质量，使废品率增加。像炼铁用的焦炭，如果灰分增加百分之一，一个化铁炉就要多用焦炭百分之二到二点三，石灰岩消耗要增加百分之四，炼铁炉的能力也要减弱。因此煤的灰分增加，就会造成工业生产上的许多损失。如中汇玻璃厂用纯煤十吨，在四小时内即可出良好的玻璃；若用质劣的煤，不但要用十二吨，花费五个小时，而且产品因不能在规定时间内烧透，色泽不明，废品率达百分之十。河北通县一家砖窑，因为烧劣煤火力太弱，一窑砖烧坏了一万多块。汉沽各工厂和茶淀造纸厂等许多工厂也因为煤质低劣，招致了生产上的损失。煤质低劣还给发电厂和铁路运输造成许多事故。齐齐哈尔铁路局由于采用了鸡西恒山和鹤岗的劣质煤，四月份发生晚点事故十二次。因为恒山煤内灰分过多，火车添煤时，烟囱上喷出大量火星，以致在林区酿成了一次火灾。郑州铁路局和徐州铁路局因为用了贾汪煤矿的劣质煤，延缓了行车速度，影响了整个机车交路运转时间，铁路上竞赛运动的开展受到阻碍，造成政治上和经济上的很大损失，两个铁路局曾一度拒绝使用贾汪煤矿的煤。徐州电业局发电厂也因为采用了贾汪煤矿的劣质煤，煤的发热量由过去平均每公斤六百大卡（发热量单位）降低到五百大卡左右，这就提高了发电成本，影响了生产的正常进行。
    煤质低劣现象在群众中也造成了极坏的影响，许多用户看煤不好要求退货，大量的煤卖不出去。陶庄煤矿因没有清除掉煤中的天然焦，甚至雷管、炸药等爆炸物也掺杂在内，曾酿成惨案。徐州一位孔老太太和江苏宜兴一个姓邢的铁匠都因此被炸瞎了眼睛。
    煤质低劣，浪费了国家大量财富。据煤矿管理总局的不完全统计，由于第一季度各地国营煤矿所产煤中的矸石、灰分增加，浪费了火车运输费一百三十亿元。中国煤业建筑器材公司今年一月到四月，由于运出的煤中夹杂矸石很多，浪费了运费和购买这些矸石的资金总计将达一百亿元以上。同时因为煤质低劣，用户不提运，不少煤矿积压了大量的煤。洪山煤矿从去年十月到今年三月，煤的积压从一万二千多吨增加到十二万八千多吨，使得资金周转困难，不能及时发放工资，而煤积压愈久，质量也就愈低。
    造成煤质日益低劣的主要原因，是各地煤矿领导干部普遍有片面追求产量、忽视质量的思想。如山东洪山三山井的一个掌子面，据苏联专家正确计算，只能采煤二百吨；可是他们的采煤计划却是三百吨，多的这一百吨就是矸石。更严重的如淮南九龙岗矿采煤队长段克明，公然把矸石敲碎掺到煤里，经检查组抽查了一车煤，发现有百分之三十是矸石。大通矿三月三十一日有一车煤，经检查发现上面是好煤，下面大部是矸石。京西煤矿大台矿矿长陈耀德竟把一九五○年采掘的、已经完全变质、矸石甚多的一千五百吨煤掺入唐家地煤堆里，今年四月间，他又第二次把业已变质的四、五千吨旧煤掺入。大台矿的煤本来不好，这样一来就更加糟糕，中国煤业建筑器材公司只好停运，严重影响了生产。由于领导方面有片面任务观点，对职工的教育也就很差，又没有严格的产品验收制度，形成质量无人负责的情况。
    针对以上情况，中央燃料工业部最近召开了一次会议，邀请中央商业部、中国煤业建筑器材公司和主要用户等方面的代表参加。会议检查了各地煤矿产煤质量的情况，决定在最近期间在各地煤矿中进行改进煤的质量的工作。
