The Propaganda Departments of the CPC Central Committee Northeast Bureau and Central South Bureau
Respectively Held Regional Theoretical Education Work Conferences

    In order to implement the "Instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on Cadre Theoretical Education in 1953-1954," the Propaganda Department of the CPC Central Committee Northeast Bureau held a symposium on theoretical education work in the Northeast Region from May 12th to 16th. The meeting was attended by 71 people, including the directors of the theoretical education departments of the provincial and municipal party committees, the directors of study offices, the principals of individual spare-time political schools, the ministers of propaganda of the party committees of a few large factories and mines, and the ministers of propaganda of the party committees of Northeast first-level organs. The meeting mainly discussed how to implement the instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and how to prepare for the study. Opinions were also exchanged at the meeting on the study of cadres in factories and mines and the spare-time cultural study of cadres.
    At the beginning of the meeting, Li Zhuoran, Minister of the Propaganda Department of the Northeast Bureau, gave important instructions. He first pointed out the great significance of the Central Committee's instructions and the favorable conditions for implementing them. He said that today our country has entered a new period of large-scale planned economic construction, and studying the theory and experience of socialist economic construction in the Soviet Union has become a very important task for all party cadres. The Central Committee's instructions will undoubtedly set off a wave of enthusiasm for studying the Soviet Union among all party cadres in the Northeast, which will have a huge and profound effect on the economic construction work in the Northeast. Our conditions for carrying out theoretical education for cadres are much better today than ever before. When talking about some existing experiences in adhering to study, he pointed out that three experiences are valuable. These are: (1) Give play to the core role of senior cadre study groups in learning leadership; (2) Establish study rooms to play a greater guiding role in learning; (3) Run spare-time political schools well, which is a good form for organizing middle and primary group cadres to study. Finally, he called on the cadres attending the meeting to recognize the favorable environment for theoretical education of cadres today, and on the basis of what has already been achieved, organize the theoretical study of cadres more systematically.
    After five days of discussion, Liu Zizai, Deputy Minister of the Propaganda Department of the Northeast Bureau, made a concluding report. In his summary, Liu Zizai emphasized that the focus of current work is to seize the time to conscientiously and diligently do various preparatory work, and a key issue in the preparatory work is to train teachers and tutors, especially to train teachers and tutors for the intermediate group. He reminded the cadres attending the meeting that they must attach importance to this work ideologically, and strive for the attention and support of the provincial and municipal party committees, take the initiative to think of all possible ways, use existing favorable conditions, and strive to create some favorable conditions, organize forces, overcome difficulties, and implement the instructions of the Central Committee. Any ideas and practices that are not actively preparing for the work must be corrected. Regarding the work of training teachers and tutors, Liu Zizai pointed out that each province and city should immediately select and train a group of teachers and tutors for the intermediate group. For teachers and tutors who have already been hired, we must focus on improving their lecturing level, help and urge them to prepare lessons, and give them certain convenient conditions and preparation time to strengthen their research on the course. As for the training method, it can be determined according to specific conditions. If it is possible to leave their jobs, they should try to leave their jobs for training. If it is difficult to leave their jobs, they can take a semi-leave job method (spending three to five half days a week) for training, or give them necessary training in their spare time; teachers and tutors who cannot attend short-term training courses must also study first, so that they can "learn and teach at the same time."
    Regarding the grouping standards and principles, Liu Zizai emphasized that it is necessary to realistically base on the grouping principles instructed by the Central Committee, and according to the cadres' understanding and acceptance ability (that is, according to the cadres' political and theoretical level, cultural level, work experience, etc.) to carry out. It is absolutely not allowed to inappropriately raise or lower the standards. The purpose of grouping is to enable cadres to study in line with their level, gradually improve, and advance in an orderly manner. As for regarding grouping as political treatment and having unrealistic ideas, attention should also be paid to correcting them. On the issue of strengthening leadership, he particularly pointed out that it is necessary to first strengthen the core leadership role of senior groups, not only requiring senior cadres to study well themselves, but also requiring them to guide the study of intermediate and primary groups, so as to complete the entire study plan. Secondly, it is necessary to establish and improve professional institutions, equip them with a certain number of cadres, and strengthen the work of the theoretical education department and the study office. In his concluding report, Liu Zizai repeatedly asked the cadres attending the meeting to take immediate action under the leadership and support of the party committee after returning to their respective places, do a good job in preparation, and ensure that the study starts as scheduled on July 1st.
                    (According to a report from the Northeast Daily)
    In order to implement the "Instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on Cadre Theoretical Education in 1953-1954," the Propaganda Department of the CPC Central Committee Central South Bureau held a work conference on cadre theoretical education in the Central South Region from May 20th to 28th.
    Since the Central Committee successively issued instructions on cadre theoretical education in October and November last year, party committees at all levels in the Central South Region have strengthened their leadership over cadre theoretical education, fundamentally changing the past irregular and spontaneous state of theoretical study, and bringing cadre theoretical education into a new period. At present, more than 370,000 cadres in high, middle, and primary groups in the Central South Region are participating in theoretical study. 3,381 part-time and full-time theoretical teachers have been equipped, and 43 spare-time political schools have been established. Under the supervision of the party organization and the influence of leading cadres taking the lead in learning, most cadres have been able to squeeze time out of their work to study, adhere to the study system, improve their interest in theoretical study, and a group of better groups and activists have emerged.
    The meeting conducted discussions based on the Central Committee's "Instructions on Cadre Theoretical Education in 1953-1954" and in conjunction with the situation in the Central South Region. Everyone agreed that the key to carrying out cadre theoretical education in the future still lies in strengthening leadership and supervision by the party committee, and gradually strengthening the guidance of study on the basis of continuing to consolidate the study organization and system. The main shortcoming of party committees at all levels in this period regarding the study of cadres, especially the theoretical study of senior group cadres, is the lack of emphasis on the supervisory role of party branches. The meeting pointed out that in the future, the supervisory role of the branch over the theoretical study of party member cadres must be strengthened. All party member cadres, including senior group cadres, must report their study situation to the branch without exception, and the branch is responsible for reporting to the higher party organization. The meeting studied the tendency of cadres to rush to connect with reality without painstakingly studying the documents. It was believed that it is necessary to promote a style of study that is serious in reading and painstakingly studying, and it is not appropriate to connect with reality too early before understanding the spirit and essence of the documents. The meeting discussed the issue of study guidance, believing that it was completely necessary and correct for the party committee to concentrate its efforts on organizing study in the past. In the future, in addition to continuing to strengthen organizational work, attention should also be paid to gradually strengthening the guidance of study. The central link to solving the study guidance of high, middle, and primary groups is for the central study group of the provincial and municipal party committees to study conscientiously and help the study of general cadres.
    Regarding the establishment of theoretical teachers, spare-time political schools, study rooms, etc., the meeting conducted detailed research and required that agencies above the provincial and municipal level equip part-time teachers this year, and agencies above the provincial and municipal level should equip full-time theoretical teachers for the primary group according to the standard of one for every 500 to 1,000 people. The provincial and municipal party committees should establish training courses or Marxist-Leninist schools for training theoretical teachers and study tutors within this year, and at the same time, they must try to run at least one spare-time political school for the middle and primary groups respectively, in order to gain experience and gradually promote them. Regarding study rooms, the provincial and municipal party committees should gradually establish them according to the conditions of the cadres. The meeting also discussed the progress of studying Chapters 9-12 of the "History of the CPSU (B)", cadre cultural learning, adjustment of schools, implementation of regular examinations, and the work of the theoretical education department of the party committee propaganda department.

    中共中央东北局宣传部和中南局宣传部
    分别召开全区理论教育工作会议
    为贯彻中共中央“关于一九五三—一九五四年干部理论教育的指示”，中共中央东北局宣传部在五月十二日到十六日召开了东北区理论教育工作座谈会。到会的有各省市党委理论教育处处长、学习室主任、个别业余政治学校校长、少数大厂矿党委宣传部部长，以及东北一级机关各党委宣传部部长等共七十一人。会议主要讨论了如何贯彻中共中央的指示及做好学习前的准备工作问题。对厂矿干部学习及干部业余文化学习等问题，会上也交换了意见。
    在会议开始时，东北局宣传部部长李卓然作了重要指示。他首先指出了中共中央这次指示的重大意义和贯彻这一指示的有利条件。他说，今天我们国家已开始进入大规模有计划的经济建设的新时期，学习苏联社会主义经济建设的理论和经验已更加成为全党干部十分重要的任务。中央这一指示无疑地将掀起东北全党干部学习苏联的热潮，这对东北全区的经济建设工作将会产生巨大的、深刻的作用。我们现在开展干部理论教育工作的条件，比以往任何时期都好得多了。在讲到已有的一些坚持学习的经验时，他指出有三项经验是可贵的。这就是：（一）发挥高级干部学习组在学习领导中的核心作用；（二）建立学习室，使它在学习中起更大的辅导作用；（三）办好业余政治学校，这是组织中、初级组干部学习的良好形式。最后，他号召到会干部必须认清今天干部理论教育工作所处的有利环境，在已有基础上把干部理论学习更加有系统地组织起来。
    会议经过五天的讨论，最后由东北局宣传部副部长刘子载作了总结报告。刘子载在总结中着重指出，当前工作的重点就是要争取时间认真努力地做好各项准备工作，而准备工作中的一个关键问题就是训练教员、辅导员，特别是训练中级组的教员、辅导员。他提醒到会干部必须从思想上重视这个工作，并争取省市党委领导上的重视和支持，主动地想尽一切办法，利用已有的有利条件，并努力创造一些有利条件，组织力量，克服困难，贯彻中央的指示。任何不积极进行准备工作的想法和作法都必须加以纠正。关于训练教员、辅导员的工作，刘子载指出：各省市应立即选拔和训练一部分中级组的教员和辅导员。对已经聘好的教员、辅导员，必须从提高讲授水平着眼，帮助和督促他们准备课程，给他们一定的便利条件和备课时间，以加强对课程的研究。至于训练方式可以根据具体条件来确定，能够离职的就尽量离职训练，离职有困难的可采取半离职方式（每周抽出三、五个半天）进行训练，或在业余时间给以必要的训练；凡不能参加短期训练班的教员、辅导员，也必须先学一步，使他们“边学边教”。
    关于编组标准和原则，刘子载强调指出：必须实事求是地依据中央指示的编组原则，依照干部的理解和接受能力（即根据干部的政治理论水平、文化程度、工作经验等条件）来进行。决不能不适当地提高或压低。编组的目的是使干部学习能够切合他们的水平，逐步提高，循序前进。至于把编组看做政治待遇和有好高骛远的想法也应注意纠正。对加强领导的问题，他特别指出必须首先加强高级组的核心领导作用，不仅要求高级干部本身学好，并且要求他们指导中级和初级组的学习，从而完成整个学习计划。其次，要建立与健全专业机构，配备一定数量的干部，加强理论教育处和学习室的工作。刘子载在总结报告中，一再要求到会干部回到各地后，在党委的领导和支持下立即行动起来，做好准备工作，保证在七月一日如期开始学习。
                （据东北日报讯）
    中共中央中南局宣传部为贯彻中共中央“关于一九五三—一九五四年干部理论教育的指示”，在五月二十日到二十八日召开了中南区干部理论教育工作会议。
    从去年十月、十一月中央先后发布关于干部理论教育的指示以来，中南各级党委已加强了对干部理论教育的领导，根本上改变了过去理论学习的不经常和自流的状态，使干部理论教育进入一个新的时期。现在中南区参加理论学习的高、中、初级组干部达三十七万多人，已配备兼职和专职理论教员三千三百八十一人，举办业余政治学校四十三所。在党组织的监督和主要负责干部带头学习的影响下，多数干部已能在工作中挤出时间学习，坚持了学习制度，提高了对理论学习的兴趣，并涌现了一批较好的小组和积极分子。
    会议根据中央“关于一九五三—一九五四年干部理论教育的指示”，结合中南区情况进行了讨论。大家一致认为今后开展干部理论教育的关键仍在于党委加强领导和监督，并在继续巩固学习组织和制度的基础上逐步加强对学习的指导。这个时期各级党委对干部学习特别是高级组干部理论学习的领导，主要的缺点之一是没有强调党支部的监督作用。会议指出，今后支部对党员干部理论学习的监督作用必须加强，所有党员干部包括高级组干部在内，无例外地都须向支部汇报学习情况，支部负责向上级党组织报告。会议研究了干部学习中存在的不刻苦钻研文件就急于联系实际的偏向，认为必须提倡认真读书、刻苦钻研的学风，在没有领会文件的精神与实质前不宜过早地联系实际。会议讨论了学习指导问题，认为党委过去集中精力把学习组织起来是完全必要和正确的，今后除应继续加强组织方面的工作外，还应注意逐步加强对学习的指导。解决高、中、初级组学习指导的中心一环，是要各省、市党委会的中心学习小组认真学习，并帮助一般干部的学习。
    对于建立理论教员、业余政治学校、学习室等问题，会议进行了详尽的研究，要求各省市地委级以上机关今年先配备兼职教员，省、市以上机关今年应按五百到一千人配备一个专职教员的标准，先配备初级组的专职理论教员。各省、市委今年内应将培养理论教员和学习辅导员的训练班或马克思列宁主义学校建立起来，同时并须试办中、初级组业余政治学校至少各一所，以取得经验，逐步推广。关于学习室，各省、市委应根据干部条件逐步地建立。会议对学习“联共（布）党史”九—十二章的进度、干部文化学习、调整学校、执行定期考试和党委宣传部理论教育处的工作等问题，也进行了讨论。    （新华社）
