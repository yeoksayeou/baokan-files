Xinhua News Agency, London, June 3rd: TASS, London, June 2nd: The British National Women's Conference issued a statement on May 31st saying that a ceasefire in Korea could be achieved within weeks if the British government took a firm stance. The statement said: "Not a moment more can be wasted. The National Women's Conference calls on British women to take immediate action, writing or telegraphing the Members of Parliament who represent them, demanding an end to the war, and insisting that if the American representatives continue to obstruct the progress of the armistice negotiations, the British government should immediately withdraw all its troops from Korea."

The statement said that the Korean War will have lasted three years by June 25th. The statement pointed out: "If a ceasefire is not achieved by June 25th, the mothers and wives of soldiers in Korea will line up at Parliament to personally petition their Members of Parliament and the government."

Women throughout Britain are actively participating in the peace movement. In Stockton-on-Tees (Durham), a group of women - members of the Municipal Women's Conference - are collecting signatures for a petition supporting the Great Power talks and the successful completion of the Panmunjom armistice negotiations. The petition demands that if negotiations fail, British troops be withdrawn.

    英国全国妇女大会发表声明要求实现朝鲜停战
    【新华社三日讯】塔斯社伦敦二日讯：英国全国妇女大会在五月三十一日发表声明说，只要英国政府采取坚定立场，那么在几星期以内就能实现朝鲜停战。声明说：“一点时间也不能再浪费了。全国妇女大会号召英国妇女立刻行动起来，写信或打电报给在议会中代表妇女们的议员，要求结束战争，并坚持如果美国代表继续阻挠停战谈判的进展，英国政府就立刻从朝鲜撤回全部军队。”
    声明说，朝鲜战争到六月二十五日就要满三年了。声明指出：“假如到六月二十五日停战还不实现的话，在朝鲜的军人的母亲和妻子将排队到议会去，亲自向她们的议员和政府请愿。”
    全英国妇女都在积极地参加和平运动。在蒂斯河畔的斯托克顿（达拉谟）有一群妇女——市妇女大会的会员，为支持大国会谈并胜利完成板门店停战谈判的呼吁书征集签名。呼吁书要求，假如谈判失败，就撤退英国军队。
