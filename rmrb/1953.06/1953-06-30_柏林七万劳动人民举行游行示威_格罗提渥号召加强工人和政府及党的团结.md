Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, June 29th: The working people of the German Democratic Republic continue to express their trust in the government and the Party of the working people through demonstrations and rallies.

On June 26th, 70,000 Berlin workers held a demonstration to show their support for the government's policy for the benefit of the people and peace, and for the unification of Germany. They also expressed their determination to defend the cause of the Republic and oppose the provocations of the West German and foreign monopoly capitalists' hirelings. The pouring rain did not diminish the enthusiasm of the demonstrators. They arrived at the square in front of the government building, where they held a rally. They warmly welcomed Otto Grotewohl, Chairman of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany and Prime Minister of the German Democratic Republic, and Walter Ulbricht, General Secretary of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany and Deputy Prime Minister of the German Democratic Republic, who appeared on the stage. Grotewohl pointed out at the meeting that the new decisions taken by the Council of Ministers on June 11th, based on the suggestions of the Politburo of the Socialist Unity Party, primarily aimed to promote understanding between East and West Germany. This greatly alarmed the Bonn politicians who advocate division. Therefore, they launched "Day X." These provocations attempt to obstruct the peaceful resolution of the German question, and hinder the promotion of the Four Powers' talks and the conclusion of a German peace treaty. Amidst enthusiastic applause from the audience, he emphasized that the unity of workers, the government, and the Party of the German Democratic Republic should be further strengthened. In the industrial district center of Köpenick in Berlin, thousands of workers held another grand rally.

On June 27th, 8,000 workers in Suhl, Thuringia, held a rally to express their complete trust in the government and the Party. The participants sent a telegram to the Prime Minister of the German Democratic Republic, Grotewohl, praising all the measures taken by the government to improve the living standards of the working people and restore the unification of Germany.

10,000 workers and representatives of farmers from the Cottbus area and nearby villages also met to express their complete loyalty to the government and the Party.

    柏林七万劳动人民举行游行示威
    格罗提渥号召加强工人和政府及党的团结
    【新华社二十九日讯】柏林消息：德意志民主共和国的劳动人民，继续用示威、集会来表示他们对政府和劳动人民的党的信任。
    二十六日，柏林七万劳动人民举行游行示威，表示他们支持政府为了人民与和平的利益，为了德国的统一的政策。他们并表示要坚决保卫共和国的事业，反对西德及外国垄断资本家雇佣者的挑衅。倾盆的大雨也没有降低示威群众的热情。他们到达政府门前广场，在那里举行集会。他们热烈地欢迎在台上出现的德国统一社会党主席、德意志民主共和国总理奥托·格罗提渥和德国统一社会党总书记、德意志民主共和国副总理华尔特·乌布利希。格罗提渥在会上指出，六月十一日部长会议根据统一社会党政治局的建议而采取的新的决定，其首先的作用就是促进东西德之间的谅解。这使得主张分裂的波恩政客们大为惊慌。因此他们就发动“X日”。这些挑衅企图阻挠和平解决德国问题，阻挠促进四大国会谈和订立一个对德和约。在听众的热烈鼓掌声中，他着重指出，应该更加强德意志民主共和国的工人和政府及党的团结。在柏林的工业区中心可本尼克区，数千劳动人民举行了另外一个盛大集会。
    二十七日，绍林吉亚省的苏尔有八千劳动人民举行集会，表示他们对政府和党的完全信任。与会者致电德意志民主共和国总理格罗提渥，赞扬政府旨在改善劳动人民生活水平和恢复德国统一的一切措施。
