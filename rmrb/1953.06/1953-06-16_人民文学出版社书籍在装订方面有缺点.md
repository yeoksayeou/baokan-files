    People's Literature Publishing House Books Have Defects in Binding
    A letter from Xuē Xìngbái, Zhejiang Normal College, Hangzhou: Recently, I bought two books, one is "How the Steel Was Tempered" (first edition, Beijing, 1952, printed in Shanghai), and the other is "A Call to Arms" (first edition, reset in Beijing, November 1952, red cover). Both of these books are published by the People's Literature Publishing House, and they both have problems with their binding. In the book "How the Steel Was Tempered," five pages are repeated between pages 444 and 445. These five pages are a complete waste. The book "A Call to Arms" has even more repetitions. The two articles "Storm in a Teacup" and "My Old Home" are both printed twice, and the page numbers are in a mess. In the article "Tomorrow," page 46 is followed by page 63, and in the article "Storm in a Teacup," page 78 is followed by page 63. And that's not all, the table of contents lists the two articles "An Insignificant Incident" and "The Story of Hair," but they cannot be found in the book.
    Publishing books so irresponsibly not only increases the difficulty for readers and wastes their time, but also wastes state property. I think the careless and irresponsible work style of the People's Literature Publishing House should be corrected quickly.

专栏：读者来信摘要

    人民文学出版社书籍在装订方面有缺点
    杭州浙江师范学院薛性白来信：最近我买了两本书，一本是“钢铁是怎样炼成的”（一九五二年北京初版上海印），一本是“呐喊”（一九五二年十一月北京重排第一版，红色书面）。这两本书都是人民文学出版社出版的，装订上都有毛病。“钢铁是怎样炼成的”一书在四四四页和四四五页中间重复了五张，这五张纸完全是浪费的。“呐喊”一书重复更多。“风波”和“故乡”两篇都多印了一篇，而且页次混乱；“明天”一篇到四十六页，接下去的却是六十三页，“风波”一篇到七十八页，接下去的又是六十三页。这还不算，目录里有“一件小事”和“头发的故事”两篇文章，书里面却找不到。
    这样不负责任地出版书籍，不但增加读者阅读时的困难和浪费读者的时间，而且浪费了国家财产。我认为人民文学出版社这样的马虎和不负责任的作风是应该迅速改正的。
