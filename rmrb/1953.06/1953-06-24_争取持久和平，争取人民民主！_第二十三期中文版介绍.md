An introduction to the Chinese edition of the organ of the Information Bureau of the Communist and Workers' Parties, "For Lasting Peace, For People's Democracy!" No. 23, 1953, has been published.

This issue publishes an editorial entitled "Communist and Workers' Parties—The Leading and Guiding Force of People's Democratic Countries." The editorial states: The Communist and Workers' Parties of the people's democratic countries are the true organizers and inspirers of the masses, and the leading and guiding force in the struggle to win the victory of the new social system. Their policies are the main foundation of the people's democratic system, and are wholeheartedly supported by the entire people. The editorial points out: In the struggle to win the victory of socialism, the Communist and Workers' Parties must heighten their vigilance against class enemies and their helpers, and wage a relentless struggle against them. The Party requires organizations at all levels to wage a tireless struggle against distorting the Party's political line, to carry out systematic work so that Party members are politically and ideologically trained, and to continuously strengthen ties with the masses.

Important articles published in this issue include: "The Reform of the Czechoslovak Currency System and the Abolition of the Rationing System" by Viliam Široký, Political Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia; "Cultivating Branch Secretaries" by Boris Velchev, Deputy Minister of the Party Affairs, Trade Union and Youth Department of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party; and "The Communist Party of Brazil Fights for Peace, for National Independence and the Democratic Rights of the People" by Luís Carlos Prestes, General Secretary of the Communist Party of Brazil, etc.

Široký's article points out: The currency reform implemented in Czechoslovakia on June 1 aims to ensure that the national economy has a sound and stable Koruna (Czech currency), making it possible to abolish the rationing system, further develop socialist trade, and expand the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas, and to create the preconditions for giving the working people correct remuneration according to the quality and quantity of work, and for thoroughly implementing economic accounting and other socialist management principles. Therefore, currency reform has become a reliable weapon to guarantee the implementation of a planned economy. The article says that to achieve these goals, it is necessary to rely on the joint efforts of all working people, and only by increasing labor productivity and reducing production costs can prices be further reduced, thereby further improving the living standards of the masses.

Velchev's article uses specific examples to introduce the methods and experiences of the Bulgarian Communist Party in educating and training branch secretaries. The article describes the situation of various discussion classes organized by district, city, and urban district party committees for branch secretaries, and points out: Experience shows that discussion classes that are conducted at a high ideological level and planned according to the level of the branch secretary, and that have a carefully studied study theme that combines theory and the Party's daily work well, are of great help to the branch secretary. After describing the branch work experience exchange meetings, assigning branch secretaries to report their work to the standing committees of districts, cities, and urban districts, and conducting on-site inspections and assistance to branch work and other training methods, the article says that the foundation of the multifaceted work of training and educating branch secretaries is the experience of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.

Prestes' article points out: The workers' and peasants' struggle for bread and jobs, and the broad struggle of the people against the ratification of the Brazil-U.S. "Military Agreement," further prove that the masses have been mobilized. The decisive central task of the Communist Party of Brazil is to fight for peace, for national independence, and for democratic rights. The most important political goal of the Party at present is to strive for the establishment of a people's democratic government. In order to achieve this goal, we must do everything possible to unite all healthy forces in the country around the working class to form a national liberation and democratic front.

    “争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”第二十三期中文版介绍
    共产党和工人党情报局机关报“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”一九五三年第二十三期中文版已经出版。
    本期发表了题为“共产党和工人党——人民民主国家的领导力量和指导力量”的社论。社论说：人民民主国家的共产党和工人党是群众的真正组织者和鼓舞者，是争取新社会制度获得胜利的斗争中的领导力量和指导力量。它们的政策是人民民主制度的主要基础，获得了全体人民全心全意的拥护。社论指出：共产党和工人党在争取社会主义胜利的斗争中，必须提高对阶级敌人及其帮手的警惕，向他们进行无情的斗争。党要求各级组织为反对歪曲党的政治路线而进行不疲倦的斗争，要求各级组织进行有系统的工作，使党员们在政治上和思想上受到锻炼，并且不断地加强与群众的联系。
    本期刊载的重要文章有：捷克斯洛伐克共产党中央委员会政治书记处书记威廉·西罗基的“捷克斯洛伐克币制的改革和配给制的取消”，保加利亚共产党中央委员会党务、工会和青年机关部副部长波里斯·维尔切夫的“培养支部书记”，巴西共产党总书记路易斯·卡洛斯·普列斯特斯的“巴西共产党为和平、为国家的独立和人民的民主权利而斗争”等。
    西罗基的文章指出：捷克斯洛伐克六月一日实行的币制改革，目的在于保证国民经济能有健全的和稳定的克朗（捷币），使取消配给制、进一步发展社会主义贸易和扩大城乡物资交流成为可能，并为按照工作质量数量给劳动人民以正确的报酬、为彻底实行经济核算制和其他社会主义管理原则创造了前提。因此币制改革成为保证实行计划经济的可靠武器。文章说，要达到这些目的，必须依靠全体劳动人民的共同努力，只有依靠提高劳动生产率，降低生产成本，才可能进一步减低物价，从而进一步提高群众的生活水平。
    维尔切夫的文章引用具体的例证，介绍保加利亚共产党教育与培养支部书记的方法和经验。文章叙述了各区、市及市区党委员会为支部书记组织各种讨论班的情况，并且指出：经验表明，凡是讨论班在高度思想水平上并根据支部书记的水平有计划地进行，同时又有一个经过仔细研究、很好地把理论和党的日常工作结合起来的学习主题的，对于支部书记的帮助就很大。文章在叙述了支部工作经验交流会议、责成支部书记向区、市和市区的常务委员会报告工作、和实地检查及帮助支部工作等培养方法之后说，培养和教育支部书记的多方面工作的基础就是苏联共产党的经验。
    普列斯特斯的文章指出：工人和农民要求面包和工作的斗争，以及人民反对批准巴西—美国“军事协定”的广泛斗争，都进一步证明群众已经动起来了。巴西共产党的决定性的中心任务就是争取和平、争取民族独立和民主权利。党在当前最重要的政治目标，就是争取成立一个人民民主政府。为了达到这个目标，必须竭尽全力把国内一切健康的力量团结在工人阶级的周围，组成一条民族解放民主阵线。（新华社）
