Xinhua News Agency, London, June 27th: According to TASS, on June 25th, over two hundred women whose husbands or sons are fighting in Korea marched to the Lower House to urge their Members of Parliament to strive for peace in Korea. Most of them came from remote parts of Britain to mark the third anniversary of the Korean War by more forcefully expressing their demands for peace in Korea and even world peace.
    This action was organized by the British National Women's Assembly. Before the women set off for the Lower House, a brief gathering was held in Conway Hall in central London. Monica Felton, winner of the Stalin International Peace Prize, spoke at the meeting. She said, "We are faced with the most significant task that women in our country have ever encountered. We are determined not to let the war in Korea continue for another week. The British government and the governments of the Commonwealth must make it clear to the United States government that the British people cannot tolerate the continuation of the Korean War. If the government does not do this, we will have a difficult period ahead of us. However, I am convinced that we can demonstrate our strength. We demand that the great powers hold talks to seek peace. We also demand a reduction in the length of British military service."
    After the gathering, the women marched to the Lower House. The front of the procession carried a large banner that read: "Mothers and Wives of Prisoners of War Demand a Ceasefire Now. Bring Our Loved Ones Home Quickly." The British National Women's Assembly's banner at the front displayed the slogan: "Fight for No Death. Fight for Peace, Not War. Fight for a Happy Future for Our Children." The banner of the Bristol women's contingent read: "Mothers of Bristol Say, Stop the Korean War Immediately."
    Most of the group went to the Lower House, while a smaller delegation went to the Prime Minister's residence on Downing Street, where they left a letter for Churchill. The letter said: "We, the mothers and wives of soldiers fighting in Korea, and the mothers and wives of those who have been conscripted, have come here from all over Britain to speak to you on behalf of our men and our families. Some of us have lost sons and husbands in this brutal and pointless war. Two weeks ago, our hearts were momentarily filled with hope when the agreement on the exchange of prisoners of war was signed. But now we hear that Syngman Rhee is releasing prisoners of war in large numbers, and the agreement on prisoners of war is being mocked, which has plunged us into disappointment again.
    "We mothers and wives can no longer allow the fate of our sons and husbands to be dictated by foreign generals.
    We ask you, in your capacity as British Prime Minister, to personally intervene in this matter so that the already signed agreement can be guaranteed, the terms of the ceasefire can be implemented immediately, and all our loved ones can return home immediately."
    Two other delegations went to Fleet Street to visit the editorial offices of various newspapers to express their opinions. One member of these two delegations was Mrs. Gilding, a pensioner from Portsmouth whose twenty-year-old son was killed in Korea.
    After the large group of women arrived at the Lower House, they requested to meet with their Members of Parliament. Of the Members of Parliament requested to meet, only a small number came out, and they promised to assist in the demand for peace in Korea. Some Members of Parliament condemned Syngman Rhee's actions to undermine the peace talks.

    英国妇女赴下院请愿要求在朝鲜实现和平
    【新华社二十七日讯】据塔斯社伦敦二十六日讯：六月二十五日，两百多名有丈夫或儿子在朝鲜作战的妇女结队到下院，要求她们的议员尽力争取实现朝鲜和平。她们当中大多数人是从英国各遥远的地方来的，目的是为了更加有力地提出她们对朝鲜和平以至全世界和平的要求，来纪念朝鲜战争三周年。
    这次行动是英国全国妇女大会组织的，在这些妇女们出发赴下院之前。曾在中伦敦区的康威大厅举行了一次简短的集会，“加强国际和平”斯大林国际奖金得奖人蒙尼卡·费尔顿在会上讲了话。她说：“我们面临着我国妇女历来没有遇见过的最重大的任务，我们决心不让朝鲜的战争再打一个星期。英国政府和联邦各国政府必须向美国政府说明，我们英国人民不能容忍朝鲜战争继续下去。假如政府不这样做，我们面前就将有一段艰苦的时期。但是，我深信我们能够使我们的力量表现出来。我们要求大国举行会谈以谋求和平。我们还要求缩短英国的兵役期限。”
    在集会之后，妇女们即向下院进发，队伍的前列打着一面大横旗，上面写着：“战俘的母亲和妻子要求现在就停战。赶快让我们的亲人回家”。伦敦全国妇女大会前列的横旗上写着这样的口号：“争取不要死亡。争取和平，不要战争。争取我们的孩子的幸福前途”。布利斯托尔妇女队伍的旗上写着：“布利斯托尔的母亲们说，马上停止朝鲜战争”。
    队伍中的大部分人去到下院，另外有一个人数不多的代表团到唐宁街首相官邸去，在那里，她们留下了一封信给邱吉尔。信上说：“我们在朝鲜作战的士兵的母亲和妻子以及被征入伍者的母亲和妻子，从英国全国各地来到这里，代表我们的男子和我们的家庭向你讲话。在这次残酷和没有意义的战争中，我们有些人失去了儿子和丈夫。两星期以前，关于交换战俘的协定签订了，我们的心里一时充满了希望。可是，现在我们听说李承晚大批地释放战俘，关于战俘的协议正受到嘲弄，这使我们再次陷于失望之中。
    “我们母亲和妻子们再也不能让我们的儿子和丈夫的命运任由外国的将军们摆布了。
    我们要求你以英国首相的身份亲自过问这件事，以便使已经签订的协议得到保证，停战的条款能马上付诸实施，我们的亲人得以全部马上回家。”
    另外有两个代表团到舰队街去访问各报的编辑部，表示她们的意见。这两个代表团里有一个团员叫吉尔丁夫人，她是朴次茅斯人，靠养老金过活，她的儿子二十岁的时候在朝鲜战死了。
    妇女的大队到达下院之后，要求会见她们的议员。被要求会见的议员中，只有很少一部分人出来，他们答应协助实现朝鲜和平的要求。有些议员谴责了李承晚破坏和平谈判的行动。
