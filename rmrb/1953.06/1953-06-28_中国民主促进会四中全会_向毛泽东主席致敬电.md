China Association for Promoting Democracy Fourth Plenary Session
Telegram of Respect to Chairman Mao Zedong

Respected Chairman Mao:

The China Association for Promoting Democracy, in order to summarize the work experience of the past two years, examine the problems and shortcomings in our work, and at the same time, based on the current needs of the country, determine our future tasks, recently held the Fourth Plenary Session of the Third Central Council in the capital. The meeting first requested to express our heartfelt love and pay our highest respects to you—the great organizer and leader of the Chinese People's Democratic United Front, the great leader of the Chinese people.

After twelve days of meetings, we discussed the current situation, reviewed our work, and exchanged experiences. We unanimously recognized that our future work should be to urge all members and lead the masses they connect with to continue ideological remolding, strengthen patriotism and internationalism education, and actively participate in national construction work. We firmly assure you that all members of the China Association for Promoting Democracy, under your leadership and the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, must strengthen our work, strengthen our learning, and strengthen our organization to consolidate and expand the People's Democratic United Front and strive to complete our tasks!
