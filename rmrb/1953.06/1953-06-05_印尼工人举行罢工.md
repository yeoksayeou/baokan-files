Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 3rd (TASS dispatch): Antara News Agency reports: On June 1st, workers at the Dutch Preedaeks textile factory in Bandung held their second strike. In view of the continuous rise in the prices of essential daily necessities, the workers demanded an increase in wages and living allowances. Seven thousand textile workers in Cimahi also joined the strike.

The South Sumatra Provincial Branch of the Agricultural Workers' Union also intends to go on strike because their demand for wage increases has not been met. 16,000 union workers will participate in this strike.

A statement published in the newspaper by the Agricultural Workers' Union stated: Plantation workers are starving. Indonesian workers earn only five to seven rupiahs a day, while Dutch employees earn two hundred and twenty-one to three hundred and seventy rupiahs a day.

    印尼工人举行罢工
    【新华社三日讯】塔斯社雅加达讯：据安塔拉通讯社报道：六月一日万隆的荷兰普利达克斯公司纺织厂工人举行第二次罢工。工人们鉴于主要日用品价格不断上涨，因此要求增加工资和生活津贴。吉马哈的七千名纺织工人也参加了这次罢工。
    南苏门答腊省农业工人联合会分会也打算实行罢工，因为他们的增加工资的要求没有得到满足。参加这一次罢工的将有工会工人一万六千人。
    农业工人联合会在报上发表的一篇声明说：种植园工人正在忍饥挨饿。印尼工人每天所得只有五个到七个卢比，而荷兰雇员每天却得到二百二十一到三百七十个卢比。
