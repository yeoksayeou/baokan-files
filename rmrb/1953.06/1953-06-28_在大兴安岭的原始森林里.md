　　In the Primitive Forests of the Greater Khingan Range
　　Xi Zhang
    In one of the largest forest areas in the country—the primitive forests of the Greater Khingan Range—a railway is about to be built. Once completed, the excellent timber stored in this boundless forest can be transported by train to all parts of the country.
    The primitive forests of the Greater Khingan Range are located at 52 degrees north latitude, the northernmost part of the country; at an altitude of 1,400 meters, it is also the highest area in Northeast China. The climate in winter is extremely cold, reaching about minus 60 degrees Celsius; while in the Jiangnan region spring brings blooming flowers and lush grass, here it is still frozen with ice and snow. In summer, the days are long and the nights are short, with dawn breaking at two or three in the morning and darkness not falling until nine in the evening; the opposite is true in winter, with daybreak at nine in the morning and nightfall at three in the afternoon. There are mountains, rivers, and forests here, but it is sparsely populated. In the past, the Oroqen people came here to hunt, but in recent years, due to the dwindling number of wild animals, they have also moved away.
    Last winter, we—the more than 400 comrades from the Eleventh Survey and Design Team of the Central Ministry of Railways, including Han, Mongolian, Hui, Manchu, and Oroqen nationalities—came here to begin work.
    When we took the China Changchun Railway train to Yakutsk station, then changed to the Yalin line train to Gulu Du’er, and then from Gulu Du’er to Tuli River, we saw dense forests lining both sides of the station. The houses were made of piled-up logs, resembling the forest hotel in the famous Soviet film "Siberian Symphony." According to people from the Forestry Bureau, there are already 90,000 cubic meters of timber stockpiled along the railway, waiting to be transported to all parts of the country after the railway is completed. On the south bank of the Tuli River is a grassland, and soon a modern city will appear here, with shops, factories, schools, and parks.
    Passing Tuli River and going north along the Yituli River, we arrived in the heart of the primitive forest. Here is another scene altogether. On both sides of the river is a stretch of wasteland with grass taller than half a person, and beside the grassland are dense thickets. Here there are red shrub forests covered with white fluffy balls, as well as white birch forests with newly sprouting green buds and tall yellow pine trees. The sunlight shines through the gaps in the branches, making them appear particularly bright and beautiful. The thickets cover the mountains, obscuring the rocks and soil, leaving only a sea of trees.
    In this highland area of the Greater Khingan Range, we climb high mountains, cross great rivers, and persist in our work despite the difficulties. Our task is to survey railway lines in the places we pass, to create conditions for the establishment of modern factories and cities on this grassland in the future, and to supply the country's large-scale construction with the infinitely rich timber here. Everyone of us feels infinitely happy when we think of this, which increases our strength to overcome difficulties.
    When we climbed over the ridge of the Greater Khingan Range and conducted foot reconnaissance and rough surveying along the 200-kilometer route from the Gen River to the Beierqi River, we had to compare various routes to find the ones that were shorter, with smaller slopes, lower construction costs, and greater transport capacity. Because there was no one here to ask for directions, we had to explore on our own. Often, after climbing mountains and crossing ridges, our cotton trousers were worn so thin that the cotton stuffing was exposed. Sometimes, when we found a mountain pass with a gentle slope, we were overjoyed and immediately reported it. Foot reconnaissance is the vanguard of surveying. We set up tents wherever the foot reconnaissance took us; sometimes we inevitably lost our way in forests where we could not see the sun or the sky, and sometimes we had to be vigilant against attacks by bears, wolves, and wild boars at night.
    After the foot reconnaissance was preliminarily determined, the alignment group planted red and white flags in the forest, and the traverse group followed by driving wooden stakes... At the fastest, we could cover more than five kilometers a day. In the forest, in addition to felling towering trees, many small shrubs had to be cut down to create a straight path for surveying work. Sometimes, when encountering dense forests, it would take several days to cut through a single ridge. Here, because the climate is cold and the ground is permanently frozen, the tree roots do not penetrate deeply, and many tall trees are often blown down by strong winds and left to rot. It is estimated that the timber that rots each year is enough to build a railway from Manzhouli to Guangzhou. Now they are lying on the roads, and sometimes we have to climb over them or crawl under them when walking. Comrades who like to joke say: "These things are about to turn over; they will be transported to all parts of the country and become the pillars of skyscrapers!" The snow on the paths is very deep, sinking to the knees with each step; besides the white snow, there are also yellow pine needles and red old pine bark, and those walking behind must follow in the footsteps of those in front. The climate often changes several times a day. Suddenly a dark cloud comes, and snow flies, but in less than half an hour the snow clears and the sun shines, making it impossible to open your eyes in the sunlight. Every day, we work in the sea of trees in the Greater Khingan Range, waving red and white flags in our hands, watching the lenses of the instruments, not afraid of the cold, regardless of the wind and snow, and always in high spirits.
    In this desolate place with extremely inconvenient transportation, it is truly difficult to ensure timely supply. Here, apart from the firewood and ice and snow for drinking that can be "obtained locally," everything else has to rely on supplies from places hundreds of miles away. There is an unattended supply station 45 kilometers north of Genhe. The "rear" stores things there, and the people at the "front" come to this unattended tent to pick them up, because there is no one else here besides us.
    Thanks to the comrades who do the supply work overcoming many difficulties, our life is not bad. We wear fur coats and fur hats, which are both warm and comfortable; we eat rice and white flour, and the dishes include pork, mutton, mountain chicken, salted fish, pickled cabbage, and Sichuan pickled mustard tuber. However, because smoking is prohibited due to fire prevention, comrades who like to smoke really feel too "unfree." Sometimes, when there is a strong wind, the stove cannot be lit, and we eat cold food and endure the cold. These are indeed hardships, but this is for the construction of the country, and our spirits are happy.
    Our most active time of day is after six o'clock in the afternoon. Everyone returns from their different work posts to the place full of tents, eats the dinner prepared for us by the cooks, and drinks boiled water made from melted ice and snow. After dinner, our recreational activities begin. Some play volleyball in the open space outside the tent, some play poker, play chess, read wall newspapers..., and the radio broadcasts loud songs. The afterglow of the sun shines obliquely through the gaps in the forest, showing an extraordinary flavor. When it gets dark, we begin to check our day's work under the lights and firelight in the tents, preparing to enter a new battle tomorrow! Sometimes, when everyone is asleep, the technicians draw topographic maps under the light of gasoline lamps based on the day's surveying and mapping records, often working until late at night in the sound of horses neighing and wolves howling.

    Look, this is the flourishing larch forest growing in the Greater Khingan Range, and pure coniferous trees are one of the most important materials for building railways, bridges, and houses. After the railway is built, they will be continuously transported to various places to support the country's large-scale economic construction.

### 在大兴安岭的原始森林里

　　在大兴安岭的原始森林里
    郗章
    在祖国最大的林区之一——大兴安岭的原始森林里，将要修筑一条铁路，修好以后，这个无边无际的森林中储藏着的大好木材，就可以由火车源源运往全国各地。
    大兴安岭的原始森林，位置在北纬五十二度祖国的最北的地方；海拔一千四百公尺，也是祖国东北部最高的地方。冬季气候最冷的时候，要到零下六十度左右；春天在江南该是杂花生树芳草遍野了，这里却还是坚冰封冻，大雪纷飞。此地夏季昼长夜短，早晨两三点钟天就亮了，晚上九点钟天还不黑；冬季完全相反，早晨九点钟天才明，到下午三点钟黑夜就来临了。这里有山、有水、有森林，只是渺无人烟。过去鄂伦春人曾来打过猎，近年因野兽渐少，他们也迁走了。
    去年冬天，我们——中央铁道部第十一勘测设计总队包括汉、蒙、回、满和鄂伦春等民族四百多个同志就来到这里开始工作了。
    当我们坐中长路火车到牙克什站，换牙林线火车到固鲁都尔，再从固鲁都尔到图里河时，只见沿站两旁布满密密的森林，房子是一根根原木堆积而成的，好像著名苏联影片“西伯利亚交响曲”里的森林酒店一样。据林业局的人谈，路旁已积存的木材有九万立方公尺，等待火车修通后运往祖国各地。在图里河南岸，是一片草原，不久这里将要出现一座近代化的城市，有商店、工厂、学校和公园。
    过图里河沿伊图里河上行向北，就到了原始森林的腹地。这里又是另外一番景象。河两旁是一片半人多高的荒草，草原的旁边是茂密的丛林，这里有挂满了白色绒花球的红色灌木林，也有刚顶出绿苞的白色的桦木林和高大的黄花松。阳光从树枝的空隙中投射下来，它们显得格外鲜艳和美丽。丛林遍布满山，看不出山上的石头和土色，只见一片林海。
    我们在这大兴安岭的高原地带，攀高山，涉大河，不怕困难，坚持工作。我们的任务，就是要在走过的地方，测量出一条条的铁道线路，为将来在这草原上建立近代化的工厂与城市创造条件，为把这里无限丰富的木材，供给祖国大规模的建设。我们每个人想到这里，就感到无限的愉快，增加了克服困难的力量。
    当我们爬过大兴安岭脊背，沿金河到贝尔赤河二百公里的长途中进行步勘草测时，因为要找路程近、坡度小、修建费省、运输力大的线路，就不得不更多地比较各种线路。因为这里没有人可以问路，只有靠自己摸索，常常因爬山越岭，棉裤都被磨得露出棉花。有时发现一个山口坡度小，便如获至宝，马上去汇报。步勘工作是勘测的尖兵。步勘到那里，就搭帐篷住到那里；有时不免要在看不见太阳、看不见天的森林里迷失方向，有时夜晚还要警惕狗熊、恶狼和野猪的侵袭。
    步勘初步确定后，选线组就在森林里插上红白旗，导线组就跟着打上木桩……最快的时候，一天达到五公里以上。在森林里进行勘测工作，除了参天大树必须伐倒外，还有许多小灌木必须砍去，砍伐出一条直线小道来，以便进行测量工作。有时遇到密林，一个山岭就要砍伐几天。这里，因为气候寒冷，地下常年是冰冻层，树根扎地不深，许多高大的树木常被狂风刮倒，任其腐烂。估计每年这样腐朽了的木材，可够修一条自满洲里至广州的铁路之用。现在它们还躺倒在道路上，走的时候有时需要爬过去，有时需要钻过来。爱开玩笑的同志说：“这些东西都快要翻身了，它们将被运往全国各地变成高楼大厦的支柱了！”小道上积雪很深，一踏没膝；除了白雪，还有黄色的松针、红色的老松皮，后边走的人必须踏着前边人的足迹。气候经常是一日数变，忽然来了一片乌云，大雪纷飞，但不到半个钟头又雪散天晴，阳光照在雪上叫人睁不开眼睛。每天，我们在大兴安岭的林海中工作着，手摇着红白旗帜，眼看着仪器镜子，不怕寒冷，不顾风雪，总是兴致勃勃的。
    在这渺无人迹、交通极端不便的地方，要保证供应及时，那真是困难极了。这里除了烧的木柴和喝的冰雪可以“就地取材”外，其它都需仰仗数百里以外的地方来供应。在根河北四十五公里处，有一个无人管理的供应站。“后方”把东西存到那里，“前方”的人便到这座无人管理的帐篷中来取，因为这里除了我们外，再也没有其他的人了。
    由于做供应工作的同志克服了很多困难，我们的生活还不错。穿的皮大衣，戴的皮帽子，既暖和又舒服；吃的饭是大米和白面，菜有猪肉、羊肉、山鸡、咸鱼、大头菜和四川榨菜。不过因为防火，禁止吸烟，爱吸烟的同志真感到太“不自由”。有时刮大风，炉子不能生，我们就吃冷饭、挨冻。这些确实是苦事情，但这是为了祖国的建设，我们的精神是愉快的。
    我们一天中最活跃的时候要算下午六点钟以后了。大家从各种不同的工作岗位上，回到那布满帐篷的地方，吃着炊事员同志给我们准备好的晚饭，喝着用冰雪化成的开水。晚饭后，就开始了我们的文娱活动。有的在帐篷外的空地上打排球，有的在打扑克、下象棋、看壁报……，收音机放送着嘹亮的歌声。太阳的余光透过林隙斜射在这里，显出格外的风味。天黑了，我们开始在帐篷的灯光和火光下，检查自己一天的工作，准备进入明天的新的战斗！有时，大家都睡了，技术员们在汽灯光下根据当天的测绘记录画地形图，常常在马嘶狼嗥声中工作到深夜。（附图片）
    看，这是生长在大兴安岭里的茂盛的落叶松林，其中纯针叶树是修建铁路、桥梁和房舍最重要的木料之一。铁路修筑好后，它们将被源源运往各地，支援祖国大规模的经济建设。
