    Two Questions Regarding Population Census Work
    Question: Why is a standard time specified in the population census registration work?
    Answer: The purpose of specifying a standard time is to avoid duplication and omission in the population census registration. Because the population is constantly changing, with births, deaths, marriages, migrations in, and migrations out, it is necessary to conduct a population census on a national scale based on the population situation at a specific moment to ensure the accuracy of the population data obtained. The standard time for this national population census registration is 24:00 on June 30, 1953 (Lunar May 20th). This means that whether the population is surveyed and registered before or after 24:00 on June 30th (Lunar May 20th) this year, the registration must be based on the population situation at that time. For example, if Village A conducts a population census registration on June 10th (before the standard time), and a resident surnamed Wang is registered, but he moves to another place after being registered, then by 24:00 on June 30th, he is no longer considered part of the population of Village A. Thus, the population situation in Village A has changed during the period from the time of the survey to the standard time. Therefore, according to the population situation at 24:00 on June 30th, corrections should be made, and the resident surnamed Wang should be deregistered from the original survey. Similarly, the population that has married out and died during this period should also be deregistered, and the newly added population due to births, marriages in, and migrations in should be registered. For example, if Village B conducts a population census registration on August 1st (after the standard time), the registration should be based on the population situation at the standard time, that is, people who were born, married in, or migrated in during the period from the standard time to August 1st should not be registered, because these people were not yet born, married in, or migrated in at 24:00 on June 30th, and cannot be registered as part of the population of Village B. However, the population that has died, married out, or migrated out during the same period should still be registered, because these people had not yet died, married out, or migrated out at 24:00 on June 30th, and should be registered as part of the population of Village B. This survey and registration method is very scientific. As long as we conscientiously implement the principle of taking the standard time as the standard for survey and registration, although the population survey and registration work in various parts of the country is not carried out at the same time, the population figures surveyed are the true situation of the national population at the same time.

    Question: What principles were used to determine the items for this population census registration? Is it too simple?
    Answer: The items for this national population census registration are mainly determined based on the actual needs of the current national election work, so that the population census registration work can achieve the principles of accuracy and ease of implementation. We know that conducting a national population census is a very important and meticulous task. In such a large country as ours, with a large population, and with our lack of experience in organizing a national-scale population census registration work, under such objective circumstances, in order to make this population census accurate, complete, and reliable, without duplication or omission, we must adopt simple methods and set the survey items to be practical, and must not demand too much or have overly complicated procedures. Therefore, this population census registration only has a few main items such as name, gender, age, and ethnicity. This is simple, practical, and easily accepted by the general public, and it is easy to achieve the goal of accuracy. If we add items such as class, occupation, and education level, the content of this population census will become complicated and the procedures will be cumbersome, and it will not be easy to do the population census work accurately. Therefore, in this population census work, we have to temporarily abandon important items such as class, occupation, and education level. This is absolutely necessary. Population census registration agencies at all levels and personnel participating in this work must conscientiously conduct survey and registration in accordance with the format and items of the population census registration form prescribed by the State Statistical Bureau, and must not arbitrarily change or add items. Any unrealistic excessive demands and impatience will hinder the smooth progress of the population census registration work.

    关于人口调查工作的两个问题
    问：为什么人口调查登记工作中要规定标准时间？
    答：规定标准时间的目的在于避免人口调查登记的重复与遗漏现象。因为人口是随时在不断地变动着，如出生、死亡、婚入、婚出、迁入、迁出等；所以要在全国范围内作一次人口调查，必须按照一定时刻的人口情况进行登记，才能保证调查所得的人口资料的正确。这次全国人口调查登记的计算标准时间，是一九五三年六月三十日（旧历五月二十日）二十四时。这就是说，无论在今年六月三十日（旧历五月二十日）二十四时以前或以后调查登记人口，都必须以这个时间的人口情况为标准进行登记。如：甲村在六月十日（标准时间前）调查登记人口时，某王姓居民进行了登记，但他登记以后就迁移到外地去住了，到六月三十日，二十四时他已不算是甲村的人口。这样，甲村从调查时间起到标准时间为止这一时期内，人口情况有了变化，因此，按照六月三十日二十四时的人口情况进行校正，把某王姓居民从原来的调查中注销。同样，也应该把这一时期内婚出和死亡的人口注销，把出生、婚入和迁入等新增加的人口补登。又如：乙村在八月一日（标准时间后）调查登记人口，则应按标准时间的人口情况进行登记，即对从标准时间起到八月一日为止这一时期内出生、婚入、迁入的人都不登记，因为这些人在六月三十日二十四时还没有出生、婚入和迁入，不能算作乙村的人口进行登记。但是，对同一时期内死亡、婚出、迁出的人口则仍应进行登记，因为这些人在六月三十日二十四时还没有死亡、婚出和迁出，应该算作乙村的人口进行登记。这种调查登记办法是十分科学的，只要我们认真执行以标准时间为准进行调查登记的原则，全国各地的人口调查登记工作虽然不在同一时间进行，但是所调查的人口数字却是同一时间全国人口的真实情况。
    问：这次人口调查登记的项目是根据什么原则规定的？是否过于简单？
    答：这次全国人口调查登记的项目，主要是根据当前我国普选工作的实际需要，使人口调查登记工作达到准确、易行的原则规定的。我们知道，举行全国人口调查是一件十分重大而细致的工作，在我们这样大的国家里，人口众多，加以我们对组织全国规模的人口调查登记工作又缺乏经验，在这种客
    观情况下，要使这次人口调查做到不重复、不遗漏、全面、确实，就必须采取简易的办法，把调查项目订得切合实际，而决不能要求过高和手续过繁。因此，这次人口调查登记就只有姓名、性别、年龄和民族等几个主要项目。这样做，既简单、实用，又容易为广大群众接受，也就易于达到准确的目的。如果再增加上阶级、职业、文化程度等项目，就使这次人口调查的内容复杂、手续繁多了，也就不容易把人口调查工作做得准确。因此，我们在这次人口调查工作中，对阶级、职业、文化程度等重要项目就不得不暂时舍弃。这是完全必要的。各级人口调查登记机构及参加此项工作的人员必须依据国家统计局所规定的人口调查登记表的格式和项目认真地进行调查登记，不得随意变更和增加项目。任何脱离实际的过高要求和急躁情绪都会妨碍人口调查登记工作的顺利进行。
