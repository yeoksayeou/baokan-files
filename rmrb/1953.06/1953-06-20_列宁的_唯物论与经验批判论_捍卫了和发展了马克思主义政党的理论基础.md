Lenin's "Materialism and Empirio-criticism" Defended and Developed the Theoretical Foundation of the Marxist Party
    Mate
    As Comrade Stalin pointed out, the theoretical foundation of the Marxist party, the theoretical foundation of communism, is dialectical materialism and historical materialism. This foundation was laid by Marx and Engels in the 1840s, and further developed and concretely applied in their subsequent practical activities and theoretical works. Marx's "Capital" is a model of using this theoretical foundation to study and explain the laws of development of capitalist society; and Engels' "Ludwig Feuerbach and the End of Classical German Philosophy" provides a concise and brilliant summary of the formation and development of this theoretical foundation by criticizing Starcke's work on Feuerbach.
    However, from the death of Engels to the period when Lenin wrote the outstanding philosophical work "Materialism and Empirio-criticism," new problems were posed to Marxists, both in terms of revolutionary practice and theoretical fields, requiring answers. Especially in the field of natural science, the enemies of Marxism attempted to incorrectly use some new discoveries in natural science to subvert dialectical materialism and historical materialism. Therefore, making philosophical summaries of these scientific discoveries, further confirming the irrefutable correctness of dialectical materialism with these discoveries, and advancing dialectical materialism and historical materialism became an extremely important combat task. This task was undertaken by the great Lenin.
    Lenin considered completing this task particularly important, mainly because after the failure of the 1905 Revolution, within the ranks of Marxists, some people who had never firmly stood on the Marxist position but called themselves "Marxists" (Bogdanov, Yushkevich, Bazarov, Valentinov, Lunacharsky, etc.), could not withstand the test of the Stolypin reactionary era, and could not withstand the attacks of bourgeois reactionary ideas. They attempted to use the bourgeois reactionary viewpoint—the empirio-criticism of Mach and Avenarius—to replace the basic viewpoint of Marxism—dialectical materialism and historical materialism. They proudly cited so-called "modern epistemology," "modern positivism," "philosophy of modern natural science," etc. to refute materialism, believing that Engels' views were "outdated" and Engels' dialectics were "mysticism." This arrogant countercurrent was obviously a reactionary movement in the ideological and theoretical fields that coordinated with Stolypin's political reaction. The vicious purpose of this countercurrent was to empty the soul of Marxism from its theoretical foundation, and to disarm the Marxist party ideologically and theoretically.
    Lenin's "Materialism and Empirio-criticism" precisely repelled the enemy's attack on the theoretical foundation, defended Marxism, and greatly advanced it.
    Lenin believed that since Bogdanov and his group asserted that empirio-criticism was an "original" and "newest" doctrine, and it must be used to replace the "outdated" philosophy of Marxism, then it was necessary to first make a comprehensive examination of the reactionary doctrines of Mach and Avenarius, the founders of empirio-criticism, and to see from the history of philosophy in what fundamental issues idealists and materialists differed and debated. In this way, it could help us see at what point Bogdanov and his group fell into the quagmire of reactionary philosophy.
    Lenin, like Engels, believed that the most fundamental issue in philosophy is the relationship between thinking and being. This question is eternal and ever new. It can never become "obsolete" and "outdated" because of the development of human society and the development of human understanding of the outside world (for example, the development of natural science). Whoever advocates that thinking is primary and being is secondary is an idealist; conversely, whoever advocates that being is primary and thinking is secondary is a materialist. This dividing line is very clear, and no philosophical system can transcend this dividing line. Although there are many names of philosophical systems in the history of philosophy, in the final analysis, these philosophical systems either belong to the former or to the latter. Eclectic philosophy, although claiming that it belongs to neither the former nor the latter, is actually just a variant of hypocritical idealism.
    Starting from this, Lenin fundamentally exposed the essence of empirio-criticism. How did Mach, the founder of empirio-criticism, answer this fundamental question? For example, Mach wrote: "The true 'elements' of the world are not things (objects), but colors, sounds, pressures, space, time (that is, what we usually call sensations)." That is to say, according to Mach, everything that exists is sensation, and sensation is the "element" of the world (the word "element" is used by Mach to replace the concept of "matter"). But in order to save his philosophical viewpoint from falling into obvious absurdity, Mach explained: "Elements" are divided into physical and psychological, the latter depending on the human nervous system, while the former does not, but the two are not independent and exist together. In this way, Mach declared his theory to be a "new" theory without "one-sidedness"! Therefore, he attempted to "originate" a "newest" philosophy. And it is said that this "newest" philosophy is based on "modern natural science"!
    Lenin tightly grasped Mach's topic and unfolded his arguments from all aspects, proving that Mach's theory had no "originality" at all, and proving that Mach's philosophy had not transcended the trap of idealism at all. Because, if everything that exists is "element," and "element" is sensation, then this is naked idealism. The old-fashioned subjective idealist Berkeley said in his "A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge" published in 1710: "To be is to be perceived." Although Mach attempted to conceal his idealistic stance by dividing "elements" into physical and psychological, it did not improve his position at all, but only made the problem more confusing. Because as long as you do not regard physical things as existing independently outside of psychological things, it is still a typical idealistic statement. Because both Berkeley and Fichte (another old-fashioned subjective idealist) once advocated the theory of the inseparability of things and consciousness, and the inseparability of objects and sensations. Thus, Lenin fundamentally struck at the enemy's vital point.
    While unfolding his arguments, Lenin keenly saw that the fundamental viewpoint of Mach's philosophy was not, as he himself and his followers boasted, the "philosophy of modern natural science." The fundamental viewpoint of Mach's philosophy was only connected with a faction in a department of natural science—namely, "physical" idealism. And the reason why "physical" idealism became a temporary fashion among some natural scientists was also related to some important discoveries in natural science, such as the decomposition of atoms and the discovery of electrons, the discovery of radiation theory, and the discovery of the transformation laws of chemical elements that were previously considered immutable, etc. caused by the "crisis of natural science." Because some natural scientists could not use the viewpoint of dialectical materialism to deal with and analyze these new discoveries, they fell into the quagmire of idealism—this is the key to the whole problem. "Physical" idealists tell us: "The atom has dematerialized, matter has disappeared" (Ulvich: "The Evolution of Science"). Since this is the case, since matter, which is the foundation of materialism, has "disappeared," then who would be willing to stick to the "obsolete" concept of matter and insist on the "obsolete" materialistic stance? This is the self-satisfied conclusion of all idealists.
    Faced with this problem, Lenin brilliantly saw that the crux of the problem lay in not distinguishing between the philosophical concept of matter and the physical concept of matter. Lenin wisely pointed out that the philosophical concept of matter refers to objective reality that exists independently of our consciousness; and the physical concept of matter is a theory about the specific properties of material objects and the structure of matter. Lenin's wise determination of this distinction was an important step forward in the development of dialectical materialism. Because of the determination of this distinction, dialectical materialism found further powerful proof in the new discoveries of natural science, shattered all the arrogant plans of idealists to distort the new discoveries of physics to subvert materialism, and fundamentally rescued the crisis of physics, enabling physics to continue to move forward on a new track, that is, on the track of dialectical materialism. Lenin wrote: "The difference between materialism and idealism lies in their different answers to the question of the source of our knowledge and the relationship between knowledge (and 'psychological things' in general) and the physical world; as for the problem of the structure of matter, the problem of atoms and electrons, it is a problem that only concerns this 'physical world.' … 'Matter is disappearing'—this means that the boundaries of matter that we knew before are disappearing, and our knowledge is deepening; those material properties that previously seemed absolute, immutable, and fundamental (such as impermeability, inertia, mass, etc.) are disappearing, and these properties are now shown to be relative and only inherent in certain states of matter. Because the only 'property' of matter—philosophical materialism is connected with the recognition of this property—is the property of matter as an objective reality existing outside our consciousness."
    This is Lenin's main thesis on distinguishing between the philosophical concept of matter and the physical concept of matter. This is Lenin's basic philosophical summary of many new discoveries in natural science at the end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century.
    Engels had already pointed out in his book "Dialectics of Nature": "Natural scientists believe that they can only get rid of philosophy by ignoring philosophy or insulting philosophy. But they cannot move forward without thinking, and to think, they must have thinking regulations. … Those who scold philosophy the most are precisely the slaves of the worst, most vulgar remnants of the worst philosophy." Thirty years later, the crisis suffered by natural science was precisely the result of natural scientists' failure to use the viewpoint of dialectical materialism; on the contrary, they accepted the viewpoint of metaphysical idealism. As Lenin pointed out in his book "Materialism and Empirio-criticism": Many new discoveries in modern natural science have not only not subverted dialectical materialism, but on the contrary, have further confirmed dialectical materialism.
    The crisis of physics is not only manifested in the doubts of some natural scientists about the existence of matter as an objective reality, but also in the doubts of some natural scientists about the objective nature of cognition caused by the collapse of the old theories of physics. It was for this reason that Mach and Avenarius took relativity as the basis of epistemology and fell into the quagmire of agnostic subjectivism.
    But the Russian Machists, Bogdanov and his group, did not notice this obvious fact. Mach and Avenarius said, we are relativists; the Russian Machists echoed, we are relativists. This is why they were destined to become prisoners of agnosticism and fideism.
    Lenin pointed out: The materialist dialectics of Marx and Engels indeed contains elements of relativity, but it is not relativity. That is to say, materialist dialectics admits the relativity of all our knowledge, but it does not deny objective truth, but refers to the fact that the degree to which our knowledge approaches this truth is limited by certain historical conditions.
    Lenin wrote: "From the viewpoint of modern materialism, that is, Marxism, the limit of our knowledge approaching objective, absolute truth is historically conditional, but the existence of this truth is unconditional, and our gradual approach to it is unconditional. … When and under what circumstances we advance in understanding the essence of things to discovering alizarin in coal tar or electrons in atoms is historically conditional; but every such discovery is an unconditional step towards 'unconditional objective truth.'"
    Anticipating that the Machists would refute with "this distinction between relative truth and absolute truth is uncertain," Lenin replied: "It is precisely so 'uncertain' in order to prevent science from becoming dogmatism in the bad sense, becoming dead, solidified, and rigid; but it is at the same time so 'certain' in order to most firmly and decisively distinguish it from fideism and agnosticism, from philosophical idealism and the sophistry of the followers of Hume and Kant."
    This is the boundary between dialectical materialism and relativity. It was precisely because the Russian Machists did not notice this boundary that they fell into the quagmire of reactionary philosophy through relativity.
    The reason why Bogdanov and others denied the existence of objective absolute truth was also because they idealistically and metaphysically separated practice and cognition. They repeated Mach's viewpoint, believing that practice is one thing and cognition is another. However, separating the connection between practice and cognition will inevitably deprive cognition of its objective content, its only objective source; and merely acknowledging the relativity of cognition without acknowledging the objective absoluteness of cognition will inevitably lead from relativity to idealism.
    Lenin emphasized: "The viewpoint of life and practice should be the first and basic viewpoint of epistemology." It is not only the foundation from which human understanding of the objective external world arises, but also the only standard for the objective truthfulness of our knowledge.
    In this way, Lenin insisted on dialectical materialism on the issue of truth, and opposed idealism and relativism.
    As everyone knows, the view of taking practice as the basis of epistemology was put forward by Marx in 1845, and was used as an important symbol to distinguish dialectical materialism from metaphysical materialism. Engels elaborated on this view in 1888 and 1892, while Lenin emphasized it in the sense of opposing Machism, and defended and developed its essence. Comrade Mao Zedong's work "On Practice," as a complete system of Marxist materialist epistemology, further comprehensively expounded this view.
    In his book "Materialism and Empirio-criticism," Lenin especially emphasized the party struggle in philosophy and attributed this struggle to the reflection of social class struggle. This is another important thesis in the development of Marxist philosophy. This thesis helps us to be good at adhering to principles when fighting against class enemies, and to be good at seeing through the enemy's conspiracies and tricks from the source of social classes.
    In his book, in the section "Partisanship in Philosophy and Headlessness in Philosophy," Lenin discussed in detail the vivid examples of Marx and Engels adhering to materialism and opposing idealism on many specific issues. Lenin pointed out that Marx and Engels consistently implemented the principle of partisanship in philosophy from beginning to end. They were good at discovering the departure from materialism and the concession to idealism and fideism in all so-called "new" schools. Therefore, they specifically criticized Huxley from the viewpoint of implementing materialism. Therefore, they condemned Feuerbach because he did not implement materialism to the end, because he inevitably fell into the quagmire of idealism in sociology, and because although he fought against religion on the one hand, he tried to renew or create new religions on the other hand.
    Based on the spirit of Marx and Engels, Lenin keenly saw the party struggle hidden behind the epistemology of empirio-criticism. This struggle is ultimately manifested as the opposing class tendencies and ideologies in modern society. Lenin pointed out: "Modern philosophy is partisan, just as philosophy two thousand years ago was partisan. Even if disguised by new terms that pretend to be knowledgeable or extremely stupid non-partisanship, the parties fighting each other are essentially materialism and idealism. … The objective, class role of empirio-criticism can be completely attributed to: faithfully serving the fideists in their general struggle against materialism, especially against historical materialism."
    Mach and Avenarius once declared that they had "transcended" materialism and idealism, transcended this "obsolete" and "outdated" opposition; but in reality, they were constantly slipping into idealism and constantly fighting a life-and-death struggle with materialism. This is the real reason why those idealists and fideists cheered for the small school of empirio-criticism.
    Lenin wrote when summarizing this issue: "The neutrality of philosophers on this issue is already slavish flattery to fideism, and Mach and Avenarius have not exceeded and cannot exceed neutrality due to their epistemological starting points." "Non-partisanship in philosophy is just a shameful concealment of slavish flattery to idealism and fideism."
    Only those Russian Machists who aspired to be Marxists would be so naive that they would try to "develop" and "supplement" Marxism with Machism. Sometimes they read Ostwald's works, trusted him, and repeated his theories, and then called it Marxism; sometimes they read Mach's works, trusted him, and repeated his theories, and then called it Marxism; sometimes they read Poincaré's works, trusted him, and repeated his theories, and then called it Marxism! Their misfortune lies precisely here: they became prisoners of the bourgeoisie, promoted the theories of the bourgeoisie, but did not realize it (if they really did not realize it), and this is surrendering to the class enemy and betraying Marxism. - Even today, among us, those who hold an "objective" attitude towards the viewpoints of the bourgeoisie should draw useful lessons from the confusion of the Russian Machists pointed out by Lenin.
    It is not difficult to see how great the significance of Lenin's book "Materialism and Empirio-criticism" is in terms of practical activities and theoretical activities. As everyone knows, the enemies of Marxism have tirelessly besieged Marxism from all aspects, attempting to disarm Marxism. And the theoretical foundation of the Marxist party defended and developed by Lenin - dialectical materialism and historical materialism, is a key issue for the Marxist party, and it is the highest basis for all activities of the Marxist party. Relying on it, the Marxist party can "discern the situation, understand the internal connections of surrounding events, and predict the progress of events" ("History of the CPSU (B)" Conclusion); relying on it, the Marxist party can formulate its own correct program, and adopt tactical lines and policies that adapt to the specific conditions of each historical period in order to realize this program. The reason why the Marxist party is powerful, able to not panic or waver at critical moments of the revolution, continue to lead the working class and other revolutionary masses forward, and defeat the class enemies one by one on its way forward is mainly relying on this omnipotent scientific weapon. Therefore, Comrade Stalin believed that Lenin's book "Materialism and Empirio-criticism" was essentially the theoretical preparation for the Bolsheviks to formally form an independent Marxist party at the Prague Conference in 1912. Through "Materialism and Empirio-criticism," Lenin victoriously united the real Bolsheviks around himself, and implemented the split with the Mensheviks - opportunists not only politically and organizationally but also theoretically. This ensured the purity and unity of his ranks and maintained his sober mind to fight the enemy.
    What needs to be especially mentioned here is that the enemies of Marxism often try to incorrectly use the achievements of natural science to oppose Marxism when fighting against Marxism. This was the case when Engels wrote the book "Dialectics of Nature" (1870s-1880s), this was the case when Lenin wrote the book "Materialism and Empirio-criticism," and this is still the case today. Today, the "principle of covariance" in quantum mechanics, which is widely popular in capitalist countries, is essentially a revival of Avenarius's "principle of identity"; and the "resonance theory" in the theory of chemical structure is a revival of Avenarius's "principle of economy of thought." Both are subjective idealist teachings derived from the most important and basic element theory of Machism, and both are theoretical results from denying the objective reality of matter. And Mendel and Morgan's chromosome theory is mysticism in biological science, which denies that biological development depends on the nature of the living conditions of organisms, but attributes this development to mysterious and unknowable "genetic material." Studying Lenin's "Materialism and Empirio-criticism" requires being good at fighting against these reactionary trends of thought, liberating these sciences from the influence of bourgeois reactionary trends of thought, and advancing these sciences according to the path pointed out by Lenin.
    Another important theoretical principle expounded and developed by Lenin in his outstanding philosophical work "Materialism and Empirio-criticism" - the principle of partisanship in philosophy, is an unshakable principle that must be followed in all practical and theoretical activities. Marx and Engels created a brilliant model for this principle in their own era in the struggle against petty-bourgeois trends of thought such as Proudhonism, Lassalleanism, and Bakuninism; and Lenin himself and Comrade Stalin, Lenin's loyal comrade-in-arms, in their own era, in the struggle against the Social Revolutionaries, "Economists," Mensheviks, Trotskyites, Bukharinites, and nationalist tendencies, also created a brilliant model for this principle in the same way. In China, Comrade Mao Zedong's irreconcilable attitude towards various forms of right-leaning opportunism and "left-leaning" opportunist lines within the party at various periods, and the policy of criticizing them from the basis of ideological methods, also created a brilliant model for this principle, and enriched this principle from all aspects. Today, among us, due to still not being good at deeply understanding the principle of partisanship that Lenin expounded and developed in his outstanding philosophical work, it often leads to tolerance of the theoretical system of the bourgeoisie, and further to bowing down to these reactionary theories. Studying Lenin's "Materialism and Empirio-criticism" requires being good at learning the irreconcilable attitude of Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin, and Comrade Mao Zedong towards the enemies of Marxism, and being good at waging an unyielding struggle against various reactionary trends of thought of the bourgeoisie.

    列宁的“唯物论与经验批判论”捍卫了和发展了马克思主义政党的理论基础
    马特
    如斯大林同志所指出，马克思主义政党的理论基础、共产主义的理论基础是辩证唯物论和历史唯物论。这个基础早已由马克思和恩格斯在十九世纪四十年代奠定起来，并在其后的他们的实践活动中和理论著作中获得了进一步的发展和具体运用。马克思的“资本论”，就是运用这个理论基础去研究和说明资本主义社会发展规律的典范；而恩格斯的
    “费尔巴哈与德国古典哲学的终结”，则为借批评斯达克的关于费尔巴哈的著作而给这个理论基础的形成和发展作了简明精彩的总结。
    但是，从恩格斯逝世到列宁著述“唯物论与经验批判论”这一杰出哲学著作的整个期间，无论在革命实践方面或理论领域方面，都在马克思主义者面前提出了崭新的问题而要求解答。特别是在自然科学方面，马克思主义的敌人曾经企图不正确地利用自然科学上的一些新的发现来推翻辩证唯物论和历史唯物论。因此，对这些科学的发现做出哲学的总结，以这些发现来进一步地证实辩证唯物论的不可辩驳的正确性，并把辩证唯物论和历史唯物论向前推进，就成了极其重大的战斗任务。这个任务由伟大的列宁把它担负起来了。
    列宁之所以把完成这个任务看得特别严重，主要的是因为在一九○五年革命失败以后，在马克思主义者的队伍中，一部分从来也没有站稳过马克思主义立场但却自称为“马克思主义者”的人们（波格达诺夫、尤世凯维奇、巴柴罗夫、瓦伦廷诺夫、卢那卡尔斯基等），由于经不起斯托雷平反动年代的考验，经不起资产阶级反动思潮的袭击，竟企图用资产阶级的反动观点——马赫和阿万那留斯的经验批判论，来代替马克思主义的基本观点——辩证唯物论和历史唯物论。他们傲然自得地援引什么“现代的认识论”、“现代实证论”、“现代自然科学的哲学”等等来驳斥唯物论，认为恩格斯的观点已经“过时了”，恩格斯的辩证法是“神秘主义”。这个狂妄的逆流，很明显地，是配合着斯托雷平的政治的反动而来的思想领域和理论领域的反动。这个逆流的恶毒的目的，就在于从理论基础上抽空马克思主义的灵魂，使马克思主义政党在思想上和理论上解除自己的武装。
    列宁的“唯物论与经验批判论”，恰恰就是在理论基础上击退了敌人的袭击，捍卫了马克思主义，并把它大大地推向前进。
    列宁认为：既然波格达诺夫及其一伙认定经验批判论是“独创的”和“最新的”学说，必须把它拿来代替已经“过时了”的马克思主义的哲学，那么，就必须首先把经验批判论的创始人马赫和阿万那留斯的反动学说作全面的考察，并从哲学史上看看唯心论者和唯物论者究竟在哪些根本问题上发生了分歧和争论，这样，就能够帮助我们看出，波格达诺夫及其一伙究竟是在哪一点上掉入反动哲学的泥坑的。
    列宁和恩格斯一样，认为哲学的最根本的问题，就是思惟对存在的关系问题。这个问题是万古而常新的。它决不可能因为人类社会的发展和人类对于外界认识的发展（譬如说，自然科学的发展）而变得“陈腐”和“过时”。凡是主张思惟是第一性的、存在是第二性的便是唯心论；反过来，凡是主张存在是第一性的、思惟是第二性的便是唯物论。这个分界线是非常明确的，任何哲学体系都不能超越这个分界线。尽管在哲学史上哲学体系的名目很多，但归根到底，这些哲学体系要不是属于前者，就是属于后者。折衷主义的哲学虽然宣称自己既不属于前者又不属于后者，但其实它只是虚伪的唯心论的变种而已。
    由此出发，列宁就从根本上揭发了经验批判论的本质。经验批判论的创始者马赫究竟怎样回答了这个根本性质的问题呢？例如马赫写道：“世界底真正‘要素’，不是物（物体），而是颜色、声音、压力、空间、时间（即我们通常叫作感觉的东西）”。这就是说，照马赫看来，存在的一切都是感觉，而感觉就是世界的“要素”（“要素”一词是马赫用以代替“物质”这个概念的）。但马赫为了挽救自己的哲学观点陷入于显然的荒谬，于是说明：
    “要素”分为物理的和心理的，后者依存于人类的神经系统，而前者则否，不过两者不是独立存在而是一起存在的。这样，马赫就宣称自己的理论为没有“片面性”的“新”理论！因此，他企图“独创”出一种“最新的”哲学。而据说这种“最新的”哲学所依据的乃是“现代自然科学”！
    列宁紧紧地抓住马赫这个论题，从各方面展开了自己的论证，证明马赫的理论丝毫也没有什么“独创性”，证明马赫的哲学丝毫也没有超越唯心论的圈套。因为，如果存在的一切是“要素”，而“要素”就是感觉，那么，这就是赤裸裸的唯心论。老牌的主观唯心论者贝克莱在其一七一○年出版的
    “论人的认识底原理”中早就说过：“存在就是被感知”。马赫虽然企图掩饰自己的唯心论的立场，把
    “要素”分为物理的和心理的两种，也没有丝毫改善他自己的立场，只是把问题弄得更加混乱而已。因为只要你不把物理的东西看做是在心理的东西之外独立存在的，这样，就仍然还是标本的唯心论的说法。因为无论是贝克莱，无论是菲希特（另一个老牌的主观唯心论者），都曾经主张事物与意识的不可分、对象和感觉的不可分的理论。——这样，列宁就从根本上击中了敌人的要害。
    列宁在展开自己的论证同时，很锐敏地看到：马赫哲学的根本观点并不是如他自己和他的信徒们所吹嘘的是什么“现代自然科学的哲学”。马赫哲学的根本观点仅仅是跟自然科学一个部门中的一个派别——即“物理学的”唯心论相联系。而“物理学的”唯心论之所以成为某些自然科学家中间一时的风尚，又是与自然科学中的一些重要的发现，如原子的分解和电子的发现，放射理论的发现，和从来被认为不变的化学元素的转化法则的发现等等所引起的“自然科学的危机”相联系的。由于某些自然科学家们不能运用辩证唯物论的观点去处理和分析这些新的发现，他们就陷入于唯心论的泥坑——这就是全部问题的关键。 “物理学的”唯心论者告诉我们：“原子非物质化了，物质消灭了”（乌尔维奇：“科学的进化”）。既然如此，既然作为唯物论基础的物质“消灭”了，那么，谁还愿意去坚持“陈腐的”物质概念，坚持“陈腐的”唯物论立场呢？——这就是一切唯心论者自鸣得意的结论。
    面对着这个问题，列宁天才地看到：未分清哲学的物质概念和物理学的物质概念两者中间的区别，乃是这一问题的症结所在。列宁英明地指出：哲学的物质概念乃是指离我们意识而独立存在的客观实在；而物理学的物质概念，则是关于物质物体的具体特性、关于物质的构造的学说。列宁对于这一区别的英明的确定，曾是辩证唯物论向前发展的重要步骤。由于这一区别的确定，就使辩证唯物论在自然科学的新发现里找到了进一步的强有力的证明，打破了一切唯心论者企图曲解物理学的新发现来推翻唯物论的狂妄计划，并从根本上挽救了物理学的危机，使物理学在新的轨道上，即在辩证唯物论的轨道上继续前进。列宁写道：“唯物论与唯心论的差别，是在它们对于我们的认识的源泉以及认识（和一般‘心理的东西’）与物理世界的关系问题，有着各不相同的解答；至于物质构造问题，原子与电子问题，乃是一种仅仅关涉着这个‘物理世界’的问题。……‘物质正在消灭’——这是意味着我们在此以前所知道的物质的界限正在消灭，我们的认识愈加深入了；从前看起来是绝对的、不变的、根源的那些物质特性
    （如不可入性、惯性、质量等等）正在消灭，这些特性现在显示为相对的、只是物质的某些状态所固有的。因为物质的唯一的‘特性’——哲学唯物论是与承认这个特性联系着的——乃是物质之作为存在于我们的意识之外的客观的实在的特性。”
    这就是列宁关于区别哲学的物质概念和物理学的物质概念的主要论纲。这就是列宁对于十九世纪末和二十世纪初自然科学上的许多新发现所作的基本的哲学总结。
    恩格斯早就在其“自然辩证法”一书中指出：“自然科学家相信：他们只有忽视哲学或凌辱哲学才能从哲学下面摆脱出来。但是，他们离开了思惟便不能前进一步，而要思惟就必须有思惟规定。……那些辱骂哲学最厉害的却恰好是最坏哲学的最坏最庸俗的残余的奴隶。”三十年以后，自然科学所遭受的危机，恰好是由于自然科学家们不善于运用辩证唯物论的观点，相反地，却接受了形而上学的唯心论的观点所产生的结果。正如列宁在“唯物论与经验批判论”一书所指出：现代自然科学上的许多新的发现，不仅没有推翻辩证唯物论，相反地，却进一步地证实了辩证唯物论。
    物理学的危机，不仅表现在某些自然科学家对于物质作为客观实在性而存在的怀疑，同时也表现在物理学的旧理论的崩溃所引起的某些自然科学家对认识的客观性质的怀疑。马赫和阿万那留斯正是由于这个缘故把相对论作为认识论的基础而陷入于不可知论的主观主义的泥坑的。
    但是这一点明显的事实，俄国的马赫主义者波格达诺夫及其一伙竟没有注意到。马赫和阿万那留斯说，我们是相对论者；俄国马赫主义者应声说，我们是相对论者。这就是他们命定地要成为不可知论、信仰主义的俘虏的缘故。
    列宁指出：马克思和恩格斯的唯物辩证法，确实包含着相对论的因素，但并非就是相对论。这就是说，唯物辩证法承认我们一切知识的相对性，意思并非否认客观真理，而是指我们的知识接近这种真理的程度是受一定的历史条件的限制。
    列宁写道：“从现代唯物论、即马克思主义的观点看来，我们的知识对于客观的、绝对的真理的接近的界限是历史地有条件的，可是这个真理的存在是无条件的，我们之逐渐接近于它是无条件的。……什么时候和在什么情况下我们在认识物的本质上进到在煤焦油中发现亚里查林或在原子中发现电子，这是历史地有条件的；但是每个这样的发现是向着‘无条件客观的真理’前进一步，这是无条件的。”
    预料到马赫主义者会以“相对真理与绝对真理的这个区别是不确定的”来反驳，列宁回答道：“它正是这样地‘不确定’，以便阻止科学变为在恶劣意义下的独断论，变为死的、凝固的、僵化的东西；但是它同时正是这样地‘确定’，以便最坚决和断然地与信仰主义及不可知论，与哲学唯心论及休谟和康德的信奉者们的诡辩主义区别开来。”
    这就是辩证唯物论和相对论的界限。俄国马赫主义者正是由于没有注意到这种界限，便经由相对论而掉入反动哲学的泥坑里去了。
    波格达诺夫他们之所以否认客观绝对真理的存在，这又是因为他们把实践和认识唯心论地和形而上学地割裂开来的缘故。他们重复着马赫的观点，认为实践是一回事，认识又是一回事。然而割裂实践和认识的联系，就必然要剥夺认识的客观内容，它的唯一的客观源泉；而仅仅承认认识的相对性，而不承认认识的客观绝对性，就必然要从相对论走向唯心论。
    列宁强调地指出：“生活、实践的观点，应该是认识论的首先的和基本的观点。”它不但是人类对于客观外界的认识之所由产生的基础，而且是我们认识的客观真理性的唯一标准。
    这样，列宁就在真理的问题上坚持了辩证唯物论，反对了唯心论和相对论。
    如同大家所知道，把实践作为认识论的基础，这个观点，乃是马克思在一八四五年所提出，并以之作为辩证唯物论区别于形而上学唯物论的重要标志。恩格斯在一八八八年和一八九二年曾对这个观点加以详细的发挥，而列宁则在反对马赫主义的意义上加以特别强调，并保卫了和发展了它的实质。毛泽东同志的“实践论”的著作，作为马克思主义的唯物认识论的完整体系，使这个观点获得了进一步的全面的阐发。
    列宁在“唯物论与经验批判论”一书中，特别强调了哲学中的党派斗争，并把这个斗争归结为社会阶级斗争的反映。这是马克思主义哲学发展中的又一重要论纲。这个论纲帮助了我们在与阶级敌人作斗争时要如何善于坚持原则，并如何善于从社会阶级的根源上识破敌人的阴谋诡计。
    列宁在他的著作中，在“哲学上的党派与哲学上的无头脑者”一节中，详细地论述了马克思和恩格斯在许多具体问题上坚持唯物论、反对唯心论的生动事例。列宁指出：马克思和恩格斯在哲学上自始至终都是贯彻着党性的原则的。他们善于在一切所谓“新”的流派中发现对唯物论的背离，以及对唯心论和信仰主义的让步。所以，他们专从贯彻唯物论的观点去批评赫胥黎。所以，他们谴责费尔巴哈，因为他没有贯彻唯物论到底，因为他在社会学方面终于不免陷入唯心论的泥坑，因为他一方面虽然跟宗教作了斗争，另一方面却又企图更新或创造新的宗教。
    依据着马克思和恩格斯的精神，列宁很锐敏地看到在经验批判论的认识论的背后所隐藏着的党派斗争。这个斗争最终表现为现代社会中互相敌对的阶级倾向和意识形态。列宁指出：“现代哲学是有党派性的，正如两千年前的哲学一样是有党派性的。纵然被假充博学的新名词或极其愚蠢的非党派性所掩饰着，互相斗争着的党派，实质上是唯物论与唯心论。……经验批判论的客观的、阶级的作用，完全可以归结为：替信仰主义者在其一般地反对唯物论，特别地反对历史唯物论的斗争中忠实服务。”
    马赫、阿万那留斯他们曾经宣称：他们已经“超越了”唯物论和唯心论，超越了这个“陈腐的”“过时的”对立；然而在实际上，他们却无时无刻不在滑入唯心论，无时无刻不在与唯物论作殊死的斗争。这就是那些唯心论者和信仰主义者们之所以对经验批判论这一小学派欢呼喝采的真正原因。
    列宁在总结这一问题时写道：“哲学家在这个问题上的中立，已经是对信仰主义的奴颜婢膝，而马赫与阿万那留斯由于自己的认识论的出发点，是没有超出并且也不能超出中立之上的。”“哲学上的无党派性，只是可耻地掩饰着的对唯心论与信仰主义的奴颜婢膝而已。”
    只有那些渴望做马克思主义者的俄国马赫主义者才会这样天真，他们妄想用马赫主义来“发展”和“补充”马克思主义。他们时而读着奥斯特瓦尔得的著作，信赖他，重复他的理论，于是称之为马克思主义；时而读着马赫的著作，信赖他，重复他的理论，于是称之为马克思主义；时而读着普恩凯莱的著作，信赖他，重复他的理论，于是称之为马克思主义！他们的不幸正就在这儿：他们变成了资产阶级的俘虏，宣扬着资产阶级的理论，却不自知
    （如果是真的不自知的话），这就是投降了阶级敌人，背叛了马克思主义。——直到今天为止，在我们中间，那些对资产阶级的观点抱持“客观”态度的人们，应当从列宁所指出的俄国马赫主义者的迷误中汲取有益的教训。
    不难看出，列宁的“唯物论与经验批判论”一书在实践活动方面和理论活动方面有着如何巨大的意义。如同大家所知道的，马克思主义的敌人曾经不倦地从各方面来围攻马克思主义，企图解除马克思主义的武装。而列宁所捍卫的并加以发展的马克思主义政党的理论基础——辩证唯物论和历史唯物论，对于马克思主义政党来说，乃是带着关键性质的问题，它是马克思主义政党一切活动的最高依据。依靠了它，马克思主义政党才能“判明局势，能了解周围事变的内在联系，能预察事变的进程”（“联共（布）党史”结束语）；依靠了它，马克思主义政党才能制定自己的正确的政纲，并为实现这个政纲而采取适应于各个历史时期具体情况的策略路线和政策。马克思主义政党之所以强有力，能够在革命的紧要关头不慌张、不动摇、继续不断地带领工人阶级及其他革命群众前进，并在自己的前进的道路上把阶级敌人一个一个地打倒，主要地就是依靠着这个万能的科学武器。因此，斯大林同志认为列宁的“唯物论与经验批判论”一书，实质上是布尔什维克在一九一二年的普拉加会议上正式形成为独立的马克思主义政党的理论准备。通过“唯物论与经验批判论”，列宁胜利地把真正的布尔什维克团结在自己的周围，并且不仅在政治上和组织上而且在理论上实行与孟什维克——机会主义分子的分裂。这样就保证了自己队伍的纯洁和统一，并保持了自己的清醒的头脑去跟敌人战斗。
    在这儿特别需要提到的就是：马克思主义的敌人在与马克思主义作斗争的时候，往往总是企图不正确地利用自然科学的成果来反对马克思主义的。在恩格斯著述“自然辩证法”一书时（上世纪七十——八十年代）是如此，在列宁著述“唯物论与经验批判论”这一著作时是如此，在今天也还是如此。在今天，在资本主义国家中广泛流行的量子力学中的“并协原理”，实质上是阿万那留斯的“原则同格”理论的复活；在化学构造理论中的“共振论”，则是阿万那留斯的“思惟经济”原理的复活。这两者，都是从马赫主义中最重要最基本的要素论推演出来的主观唯心论的说教，都是从否认物质的客观实在性而来的理论结果。而孟德尔、摩尔根的染色体理论，则是生物科学中的神秘主义，它否认生物发展依赖于有机体的生活条件的性质，而把这种发展归结为神秘的不可知的“遗传质”。学习列宁的“唯物论与经验批判论”，就要善于和这些反动的思潮作斗争，把这些科学从资产阶级反动思潮的影响下解放出来，按照着列宁所指引的道路把这些科学推向前进。
    列宁在其杰出的哲学著作“唯物论与经验批判论”中所阐明和发展的另一个重要的理论原则——哲学中的党性原则，乃是一切实践活动和理论活动必须遵循的不可动摇的原则。马克思和恩格斯，在他们自己的时代，在反对普鲁东主义、拉萨尔主义、巴枯宁主义这些小资产阶级思潮的斗争中，为这个原则创造了光辉的典范；而列宁自己和列宁的忠实战友斯大林同志，在他们自己的时代，在反对社会革命党人、“经济主义者”、孟什维克、托洛茨基分子、布哈林分子及民族主义倾向者的斗争中，同样地为这个原则创造了光辉的典范。在中国，毛泽东同志在各个不同时期中对于党内的各种形式的右倾机会主义和“左”倾机会主义的路线所采取的不调和的态度，并从思想方法的基础上加以批判的方针，同样地为这个原则创造了光辉的典范，并从各方面丰富了这个原则。今天，在我们中间，由于还不善于去深刻体会列宁在其杰出哲学著作中所阐明和发展的这个党性的原则，往往造成对资产阶级的理论体系的宽容，并进而对这些反动理论的卑躬屈节。学习列宁的“唯物论与经验批判论”，就要善于学习马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林和毛泽东同志对马克思主义敌人所采取的不调和的态度，善于同资产阶级的各种反动思潮作不屈不挠的斗争。
