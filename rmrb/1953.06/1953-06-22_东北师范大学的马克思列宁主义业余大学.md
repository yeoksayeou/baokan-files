    The Marxist-Leninist Amateur University of Northeast Normal University

    Under the guidance of the School Work Committee of the Changchun Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, Northeast Normal University established the Marxist-Leninist Amateur University in March of this year. The Amateur University currently has 1,430 students, of whom 1,219 are teachers from universities, colleges, and secondary technical schools in Changchun, and 211 are administrative cadres from various schools. For ease of leadership, all students are divided into forty-eight classes according to classroom discussion units, making them the grassroots organizations for theoretical study.

    The Amateur University plans to systematically complete four major courses in the next four years: "Thirty Years of the Chinese Communist Party," "Fundamentals of Marxism-Leninism," "Political Economy," and "Dialectical Materialism and Historical Materialism." Currently, the second section of "Thirty Years of the Chinese Communist Party," "The Second Revolutionary Civil War," has been completed.

    The Amateur University has now established various formal learning systems, such as study attendance, student enrollment, withdrawal, examination, assessment, and graduation systems. Since the establishment of the Amateur University, students have consistently maintained a high level of enthusiasm for learning, and the quality of learning has significantly improved compared to the past. Based on the experience of running the school for the past three months, we have initially summarized the following points:

    1. To run the Amateur University well, the attention of the Party Committee and administrative leadership and the support of organizations at all levels are the primary conditions. Our school’s Party Committee and administrative leadership have always attached importance to the theoretical study of teachers and administrative cadres. In October 1952, the Party Committee formulated a four-year plan for the theoretical study of teachers and administrative cadres, and then prepared for the establishment of the Amateur University, determined the implementation plan for the Amateur University, and specifically stipulated and studied the tasks and working methods of the Party branches in each unit in leading and promoting the theoretical study of cadres. This enabled the Amateur University to be successfully established. After the Amateur University opened, thanks to the direct and specific leadership of the Party Committee, learning time was effectively guaranteed from top to bottom, which not only greatly encouraged the students' enthusiasm for learning but also mobilized organizations at all levels to cooperate with and support the work of the Amateur University. For example, the Education Trade Union has listed assisting the Party Committee in running the Amateur University as one of its main tasks and has provided great support in solving the funding problems of the Amateur University. In addition, the teaching and research sections of Chinese Revolutionary History, Fundamentals of Marxism-Leninism, Political Economy, and Dialectical Materialism and Historical Materialism have also closely cooperated with the work of the Amateur University and have played a significant role. For example, seven teaching assistants from the Chinese Revolutionary History teaching and research section serve as intern instructors and have also helped solve problems such as compiling and printing study materials. Party organizations and administrative leadership of other universities, colleges, and secondary technical schools have also provided us with much assistance, such as conducting ideological mobilization of teachers before the start of the semester, stipulating study time, and solving study funding problems.

    2. The Marxist-Leninist Amateur University is one of the best forms of organizing teachers and school administrative cadres to conduct formal political theory study. In the past few years, the theoretical study organized by our school for teachers and administrative cadres lacked long-term study plans, or although there were plans for a certain period, they were often not adhered to. Therefore, the study seemed unsystematic and could not proceed in an orderly manner. Secondly, the learning organizations and leadership of teachers and administrative cadres were not unified, and there was a lack of backbone and guidance. Thirdly, no formal learning system was established. Therefore, the quality of learning was not high. Since the establishment of the Amateur University, due to the existence of a long-term study plan and its consistent implementation, the past learning situation of "starting without finishing" and "intermittent" has been initially changed, the systematic nature of theoretical study has been strengthened, and the study has gradually become regularized. At the same time, because the main lecturers, intern instructors, class leaders, and the Amateur University office can cooperate in dividing the work and ensure that daily learning activities can proceed normally in all aspects, the past shortcomings of ununified and decentralized organizational leadership have been overcome, and the organization of learning and the strength of learning leadership and guidance have been strengthened. Teachers generally also guarantee study time. Therefore, the Amateur University can be said to have solved the problem of political theory study that has been difficult to sustain for several years, both in form and content. At the same time, the Amateur University has also absorbed teachers and administrative cadres from sixteen universities, colleges, and secondary technical schools, such as Northeast Geological College in Changchun, which has also helped other schools solve the learning problems of teachers and administrative cadres.

    3. "Classroom discussion" is an effective learning method that can deepen the theoretical study of teachers and administrative cadres. In the past, when study groups conducted discussions, there was often a phenomenon of "no leadership, no center," "not in-depth, no problem-solving," and many erroneous views could not be corrected in time. After the opening of the Amateur University, each class with the conditions organized "classroom discussions." Before the "classroom discussion," students generally wrote discussion outlines, which were reviewed by intern instructors and class leaders. After several "classroom discussions," many comrades reflected that "the discussion can go deeper," and "the ability to analyze problems has also been improved." Because the "classroom discussion" is conducted under the leadership of the intern instructor, and he makes a brief summary at the end, the "classroom discussion" has played a very good role in helping students understand the content of the lecture and consolidate the learning results.

    4. Pay attention to selecting and actively training intern instructors. In the past, we always wanted all kinds of theoretical study work to be done by veteran cadres, but there were few veteran cadres and they were busy with work, so the guidance problem of theoretical study has not been solved. Later, we selected and trained a large number of intern instructors. Most of the intern instructors are teaching assistants and young cadres from the teaching and research section of Fundamentals of Marxism-Leninism and the teaching and research section of Chinese Revolutionary History, and a few are Party branch secretaries and propaganda and education committee members. They are serious and responsible in their work and are generally welcomed by the students. The Amateur University has taken many measures to train intern instructors, such as giving them learning materials, introducing them to work experience, especially holding "intern instructor study meetings." This kind of study meeting is convened by the main lecturer before the students conduct classroom discussions. At the meeting, after discussing the issues of "classroom discussion," the main lecturer makes a summary. After the discussion and the summary by the main lecturer, the intern instructors' ability to tutor and their confidence in their work have been relatively improved.

    However, the work of the Marxist-Leninist Amateur University of Northeast Normal University still has some problems, mainly how to combine theoretical study with teachers' teaching work and scientific research work. In the past, although we have taken some measures in this regard and tried to solve this problem, none of them have had significant effects.

    东北师范大学的马克思列宁主义业余大学
    东北师范大学在中共长春市委学校工作委员会的指导下，于今年三月间，成立了马克思列宁主义业余大学。业余大学现有学员一千四百三十人，其中一千二百一十九人为长春市各大学、专科学校和中等技术学校的教师，二百一十一人为各校的行政干部。为了便于领导起见，按照课堂讨论的单位，把全部学员分别编为四十八个班，使其成为理论学习的基层组织。
    业余大学计划在今后四年中循序学完“中国共产党的三十年”、“马克思列宁主义基础”、“政治经济学”、“辩证唯物主义和历史唯物主义”等四门主要课程。目前，已学完“中国共产党的三十年”的第二节“第二次国内革命战争”。
    业余大学现已建立了各种正规的学习制度，如学习考勤，学员入学、退学以及考试、考查、毕业制度等。自业余大学成立以来，学员们的学习情绪一直是饱满的，学习质量较之过去也有了显著提高。根据三个月来的办学情况，我们初步总结了以下几点经验。
    一、要搞好业余大学，党委和行政领导方面的重视和各级组织的支持是首要条件。我校党委和行政领导方面，对教师和行政干部的理论学习一向是重视的。一九五二年十月间，党委曾制订了教师和行政干部理论学习的四年计划，随后又筹办业余大学，确定了业余大学实施方案，具体规定并研究了各单位党支部在领导和推动干部理论学习方面的任务和工作方法。这样，就使得业余大学顺利地开办起来。在业余大学开学以后，由于党委的直接而具体的领导，自上而下切实地保证了学习时间，不仅大大地鼓励了学员的学习积极性，同时也发动各级组织配合和支持了业余大学的工作。如教育工会把协助党委办好业余大学工作列为主要任务之一，在解决业余大学的经费问题上曾给予过很大支持。此外，中国革命史、马克思列宁主义基础、政治经济学、辩证唯物主义和历史唯物主义等教研室也密切配合业余大学的工作，并发挥了很大作用。如中国革命史教研室有七名助教担任实习教员，还帮助解决了编印学习材料等问题。其它大学、专科学校、中等技术学校的党组织和行政领导方面也给了我们不少帮助，如开学前对教师进行思想动员，规定学习时间，解决学习经费问题等。
    二、马克思列宁主义业余大学是组织教师和学校行政干部进行正规的政治理论学习的最好形式之
    一。几年来，我校所组织的教师和行政干部的理论学习，缺乏长远的学习计划，或虽有某一时期的计划，但也往往不能坚持。因此学习显得毫无系统，不能循序前进。其次，教师和行政干部的学习组织和领导不统一，缺乏骨干和辅导力量。再次，没有建立起正规的学习制度。所以学习质量不高。自业余大学成立以来，由于有了长期的学习计划，并坚持实行，初步改变了过去那种“有头无尾”和“时断时续”的学习状况，加强了理论学习的系统性，使学习逐步走向经常化。同时，由于主讲教员、实习教员、班长和业余大学办公室能分工合作，从各方面保证日常的学习活动能正常地进行，便克服了过去在组织领导上不统一、不集中的缺点，加强了学习的组织性以及学习的领导和辅导力量。教师一般地也保证了学习时间。因此，业余大学不论从形式上还是从内容上都可以说已解决了几年来很难坚持的政治理论学习问题。同时，业余大学还吸收了长春市东北地质学院等十六个大学、专科学校、中等技术学校的教师和行政干部参加，也就帮助其他学校解决了教师和行政干部的学习问题。
    三、“课堂讨论”是一种有效的学习方法，它能使教师和行政干部的理论学习深入一步。过去，学习小组进行讨论时，往往发生“无领导，无中心”，“不深入，不解决问题”的现象，许多错误的见解不能及时地得到纠正。业余大学开学后，有条件的各班都组织了“课堂讨论”。“课堂讨论”前，学员普遍写出发言提纲，并由实习教员和班长进行检查。经过几次“课堂讨论”，许多同志反映：“讨论能够深入下去了”，“也提高了对问题的分析能力”。“课堂讨论”因为是在实习教员的领导下进行，最后并由他作出扼要的总结，所以“课堂讨论”对帮助学员领会讲授的内容，巩固学习成果，都起了很好的作用。
    四、注意挑选和积极培养实习教员。过去，我们总是想把理论学习的各种工作都让老干部来作，但老干部少、工作又忙，因此理论学习的辅导问题，
    一直没有得到解决。后来我们才挑选和培养了大批的实习教员。实习教员大部分由马克思列宁主义基础教研室和中国革命史教研室的助教和青年干部兼任，少数是党支部书记和宣教委员。他们对工作是认真负责的，一般都受到学员的欢迎。业余大学曾采取很多的办法培养实习教员，例如发给他们学习材料，向他们介绍工作经验，特别是举行“实习教员学习会”。这种学习会是在学员进行课堂讨论之前，由主讲教员领导召集的。会上在讨论“课堂讨论”的问题后，再由主讲教员作总结。经过讨论和主讲教员的总结，实习教员对辅导能力和工作信心都相对地提高了。
    但东北师范大学马克思列宁主义业余大学的工作，还是存在着一些问题的，这主要是理论学习怎样和教师的教学工作、科学研究工作相结合的问题。过去，我们虽然在这方面曾采取了某些办法，试图解决这个问题，但都没有显著的效果。
