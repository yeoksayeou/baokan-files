    Hebei Province, Xingtang County
    Erroneous "Good Student" Campaign Leads to Negative Consequences

    The Culture and Education Section of the Xingtang County People's Government in Hebei Province, without the consent of the county Party committee or approval from higher-level culture and education departments, unilaterally initiated a campaign to select "Good Students" throughout the county at a county-wide elementary school teachers' conference in February of this year. The campaign proceeded in stages: from few to many, from partial to complete, requiring all students to become "Good Students" within one semester; re-election would occur the following semester. The selection method involved weekly student voting, followed by individual consultation and final approval by teachers, who would then issue "Good Student Certificates." The criteria for "Good Students" were determined by each school's teachers, ranging from three to six requirements, generally including: unity and friendship, adherence to schedules, no unexcused absences, maintaining public and personal hygiene, politeness, quickness, quietness, neatness, diligent study, etc., and stating that "'Good Students' are an important condition for joining the Communist Youth League and the Young Pioneers."

    This movement was widely implemented throughout the county. In general, "Good Students" accounted for one-third of the total student population in schools, with some schools reaching two-thirds.

    This approach effectively negated the principles of New Democratic education and upbringing. Consequently, it not only failed to play a positive role in educating children and promoting teaching but also created excessive tension and fear in children's minds, leading to serious consequences affecting their physical and mental health. For example, Zhu Yulin, a 12-year-old student at Shuyuan Elementary School, frequently carried buckets containing more than 60 pounds of water for classmates to become a "Good Student." Some students arrived at school before dawn every day to clean the classroom, resulting in insufficient sleep and fatigue, causing them to doze off during class. Others, fearing lateness, rushed to school without eating breakfast.

    After being selected and wearing the "Good Student Certificate," a clear distinction was drawn between "Good Students" and ordinary students, causing disunity among classmates. As a result, "Good Students" not only failed to be admired by ordinary students and feel honored but were also ridiculed and isolated. Many students, upon seeing "Good Students," would say: "You are 'Good Students,' don't stay with us; what if you get contaminated by us!" Some students at Xiguan Elementary School said: "They are 'Good Students'; we bad students are not worthy of being with them." Therefore, some "Good Students" only wore their "Good Student Certificates" at school and took them off outside the school gates. Ordinary students who were not selected as "Good Students" felt ashamed and embarrassed, losing face. Tian Guizhi, a student at Xiguan Elementary School, said: "Being with those 'Good Students' makes me feel unbearably ashamed." Some students lowered their heads in silence when meeting teachers or principals because they were not wearing "Good Student Certificates."

    Furthermore, many students were scolded by their parents for not being selected as "Good Students" and cried upon returning home. Eighteen students at Shuyuan Elementary School cried during the two selections. Cai Lingfen, a student at the school, cried four times in a row. Others lied to avoid parental blame, such as telling their parents: "I lost my 'Good Student Certificate.'" Chen Jinrong, a student at Shuyuan Elementary School, deceived her mother by saying: "The 'Good Student Certificates' are worn in rotation."

    More seriously, some students who had previously worn "Good Student Certificates" were deselected in the second election, and their "Good Student Certificates" were taken away, causing dissatisfaction. For example, one student whose "Good Student Certificate" was taken away deliberately ate food during class, punched people, and said: "Anyway, I'm a bad student now, let me be first on the record book!" Another student, dissatisfied with the removal of his "Good Student Certificate," tied his hands together in class, causing everyone to burst into laughter.

    The erroneous actions of the Culture and Education Section of the Xingtang County People's Government have been discovered by the Ding County Committee of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and a notice has been issued to rectify the situation. The notice pointed out that the practice of the Culture and Education Section of Xingtang County in deploying the "Good Student" campaign in schools was erroneous and contradicted the correct methods of leading school work. The reason why the Culture and Education Section of the Xingtang County People's Government adopted this erroneous method was that they did not carefully study the school education policy and mechanically transferred the methods of leading industrial and agricultural production to school work. The Culture and Education Section of the county's unauthorized deployment of the "Good Student" campaign was an erroneous act of seeking novelty and disregarding leadership. The Propaganda Department of the Xingtang County Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party did not promptly discover (the Culture and Education Section deployed in February, and the County Party Committee Propaganda Department only discovered it at the end of May) this problem, and after discovering the problem, it did not immediately take effective measures to correct it, nor did it report to the higher Party committee, which objectively contributed to the development of this error.

    Now, the Propaganda Department of the Ding County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has instructed the Xingtang County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party to immediately take effective measures to correct this error and instructed the Party Group of the County People's Government to suggest that the County Culture and Education Section make a profound self-criticism. At the same time, in order to prevent the recurrence of such erroneous behavior, the Propaganda Department of the Ding County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party also instructed the propaganda departments of the county committees to quickly overcome the phenomenon of not managing school work or relaxing leadership over school work. At present, the error of the "Good Student" campaign in Xingtang County has been corrected.

### 河北省行唐县  错误地进行评选“好学生”运动造成恶果

    河北省行唐县
    错误地进行评选“好学生”运动造成恶果
    河北行唐县人民政府文教科，不经同级党委同意和上级文教部门的批准，擅自在今年二月全县小学教师大会上，发起在全县范围内普遍开展评选“好学生”运动。运动开展的步骤是：由少到多，由部分到全体，要求在一学期内全体学生都要成为“好学生”；下学期重新评选。评选的方法是：每周由学生票选一次，再个别征求意见，最后由教师批准，颁发“好学生证”。好学生的条件，由各校教师自行规定，少者三条，多者六条；其内容一般是：团结友爱，遵守作息时间，不无故旷课，保持公共、个人卫生，有礼貌，快、静、齐，努力学习等，并提出“‘好学生’是入团、入队的重要条件之一”。
    这一运动，曾在全县普遍开展，一般学校评选的
    “好学生”已占到学生总数的三分之一，有的已占到三分之二。
    这一作法，实际上是否定了新民主主义的教养、教育原则的，因而不仅未能起到教育儿童、推动教学的良好作用，反而造成儿童思想过于紧张、恐惧，影响儿童身心健康发展的严重后果。如书院小学校十二岁的小学生朱玉林，为了当“好学生”，经常用盛六十多斤的水桶给同学打水喝。有的学生，每天不到天亮便到校打扫教室，因缺乏足够睡眠和过于疲劳而在上课时打盹，睡觉。也有的怕迟到，连饭也不吃就往学校跑。
    被选的“好学生”在戴上“好学生证”以后，也就和一般学生之间划了一条很明显的界限，因而造成了同学之间不团结的现象。如此，“好学生”不仅没有受到一般学生的爱戴而感到光荣，反而受到大家的讽刺，孤立起来。不少同学见了“好学生”就说：你们是“好学生”，别和我们在一块了，把你们传染坏了怎么办！西关小学有的学生说：“人家是‘好学生’，咱们这坏学生不配和人家在一块。”所以有的“好学生”到学校才把“好学生证”戴上，出了校门就摘下来。没当选“好学生”的一般学生，则感到羞羞惭惭，没脸见人。西关小学校学生田桂枝说：“我和人家‘好学生’在一块，羞得不知道有多么难受。”有的学生因为没戴上“好学生证”，遇见老师、校长低头不语。
    另外，有不少学生因没评上“好学生”而受到家长的责骂，回家便哭。书院小学两次评选中即有十八名学生大哭。该校学生蔡灵芬一连哭了四次。还有的怕受家长责备而说谎话，如对家长说：“我把‘好学生证’丢了。”书院小学学生陈金荣欺骗母亲说：“‘好学生证’是轮流着戴的。”
    更严重的是，有些已戴上“好学生证”的学生，在第二次评选时落选了，“好学生证”被摘了下来，这引起他们的不满。如有个被摘掉“好学生证”的学生，故意在上课时吃东西，用拳头打人，并说：“怎么我也是坏学生了，让我在记过簿上考第一名吧！”另一个学生因对摘掉他的“好学生证”不满，在课堂上将自己的双手捆绑起来，逗得大家哄堂大笑。
    行唐县人民政府文教科的错误作法已被中共河北省定县地委会发觉，并已通报纠正。通报指出：行唐县文教科在学校中布置开展评选“好学生”运动的作法是错误的，是和我们领导学校工作的正确方法相违背的。行唐县人民政府文教科所以采取这种错误方法，是因为他们没有认真地研究学校教育的方针和政策，将领导工、农业生产的办法机械地搬到学校工作中来了。该县文教科擅自布置评选“好学生”运动，则是一种标新立异、目无领导的错误行为。中共行唐县委宣传部没有及时发现（文教科是在二月布置的，县委宣传部在五月底才发觉）这一问题，而在发现这一问题后，又没有立即采取有效措施加以纠正，也没有向上级党委作报告，这在客观上就助长了这一错误的发展。
    现在，中共定县地委宣传部已责成中共行唐县委立即采取有效措施纠正这一错误，并责成县人民政府党组建议请县文教科作出深刻检讨。同时为了杜绝这种错误行为的再度发生，中共定县地委宣传部并指示各县县委宣传部迅速克服不管学校工作或放松对学校工作领导的现象。目前，行唐县开展评选“好学生”运动的错误已得到纠正。
