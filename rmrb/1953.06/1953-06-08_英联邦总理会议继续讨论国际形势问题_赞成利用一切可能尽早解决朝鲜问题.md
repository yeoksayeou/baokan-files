Xinhua News Agency, London, June 6th (TASS): A communique issued on June 5th from the Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Meeting stated that the Prime Ministers "continued to discuss international issues. The Prime Ministers were informed of the latest progress in the Korean armistice negotiations and held a general discussion on the Middle East issue." According to Reuters, quoting "usually reliable sources," during the discussion of the Far East situation, the Commonwealth Prime Ministers, including Churchill, "unanimously agreed that all possibilities must be used to achieve a solution to the Korean issue as soon as possible."

British newspapers continue to comment on the Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Meeting's upcoming discussions on economic issues. "The Times Review of Industry" editorial states: "The British Chancellor of the Exchequer, Mr. Butler, will likely discuss his negotiations in Washington and his negotiations in London with representatives from some Western European countries. In addition, it is speculated that the Canadian ministers (who, naturally, are better positioned than any of their Commonwealth colleagues to judge the movements of the United States) will express pessimistic views, and, if they must address the issue of American movements, they may believe that the United States is expected to strengthen trade restrictions in the coming years."

    英联邦总理会议继续讨论国际形势问题
    赞成利用一切可能尽早解决朝鲜问题
    【新华社七日讯】塔斯社伦敦六日讯：英联邦总理会议六月五日发表公报说，联邦总理们“继续讨论国际形势问题。联邦总理们获悉了关于朝鲜停战谈判最近进展的消息，并进行了关于中东问题的一般讨论。”据路透社引“消息通常可靠人士”的话说，会议在讨论远东形势时，联邦总理们，包括邱吉尔在内，“一致赞成必须利用一切可能性尽早获得朝鲜问题的解决”。
    英国报刊继续就联邦总理会议将举行关于经济问题的讨论发表评论。“泰晤士工业评论”杂志的社论说：“英国财政大臣巴特勒在讨论中将可能谈一谈他在华盛顿的谈判和他在伦敦与西欧一些国家的代表所举行的谈判。此外据测，加拿大的部长们
    （自然，他们是比他们在英联邦中的任何其他同僚更能判断美国的动向）表示悲观的论调，而且，如果一定要向他们提出美国动向的问题，他们可能认为，预计今后数年美国将加强贸易限制。”
