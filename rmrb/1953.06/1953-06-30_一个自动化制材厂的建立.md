An automated Lumber Mill

Wang Fengzhu

I

Rafts of logs huddled close together on the south bank of the Songhua River in Jiamusi. The log hauler chugged and chugged, sending heavy logs one by one to the shore. Here, one could see from afar the large slogan "Comrades, the battle has begun, advance! Build the motherland!" Especially the four characters "Build the motherland" were written in a particularly large font. Industrious forestry workers and demobilized soldiers, just like the slogan said, were working intensely in a fighting posture. Further ahead was an automated lumber mill that had only recently been established.

II

Here, apart from the workers operating the machines, there were only a few workers sparsely scattered around feeding the "liaozi" (large pieces of lumber sawn by the large band saw into smaller pieces for the small band saw), standing beside the automatic rollers, effortlessly pushing the liaozi onto the rollers. The liaozi automatically climbed to its master – the small band saw. Several workers throwing board scraps (small edge pieces that cannot be cut into lumber) lightly and happily threw the board scraps onto the board scrap conveyor chain in the basement, and the board scraps were transported outside the factory. Here, there was no common sight in ordinary factories: workers carrying liaozi running around and carrying board scraps all over the factory. Therefore, the work order was well organized, and the workers worked lightly and happily.

The technician of the No. 9 small band saw, Fang Chunshan, has been working in this factory since its establishment. In the two production campaigns launched during the construction phase, he was elected as a labor model. Now, he happily saws the liaozi that climbs from the automatic rollers. These sawn timbers climb to the conveyor belt through the automatic rollers and are transported directly to the lumber selection yard. He said to me: "Look at our automated factory, it reduces a lot of physical labor." Old Liu, who hooks the liaozi (using a hook to hook the liaozi sawn by the large band saw), said:

"The automatic roller is really good. In the past, it took a lot of effort to hook the large liaozi, and sometimes the saw blade was bent; now it's really labor-saving. With a light pull, the liaozi is on the automatic roller." The lumber selection yard here has also changed its appearance. Sleepers and large bridge timbers are directly loaded onto flat cars at the end of the conveyor belt and transported to the storage yard by lumber carriers. General timbers fall from the conveyor belt to the automatic chain of the lumber selection table. The automatic chain slowly drags the timbers forward. The product appraiser stands in front of the table and unhurriedly flips the timbers, grading them according to the national standards; unlike in the past, when several flat cars of timber were pushed into the lumber selection yard at the same time, making the product appraiser sometimes sweating profusely and sometimes having nothing to do. The phenomenon of uneven busyness and idleness no longer exists at all. The lumber selectors are arranged in front of the lumber selection table, and they each stand in a fixed position to load the graded timbers onto flat cars according to the length and type of tree. Because the timbers come continuously on the automatic chain, the allocation is very even in terms of time and workload.

The sawdust scraper set up in the basement runs vertically and horizontally between the various sawing machines, and finally transports the sawdust to the boiler. The old worker Yin Zhongxian, who has worked in the lumber mill for twenty-one years, tried everything possible to eliminate possible failures of automated equipment. When the sawdust scraper was first started, the iron ring of the scraper often could not be hung on the toothed wheel and the chain fell off because bark or small pieces of wood fell into the sawdust. In order to solve this problem, Yin Zhongxian installed wire mesh on the sawdust chutes of each sawing machine (the sawdust flows from the chutes to the troughs of the sawdust scraper), so that bark and small pieces of wood could no longer mix into the sawdust, and the sawdust scraper started smoothly. He said: "The automated equipment designed by Soviet experts is all good to use, it depends on how we manage and use it. As long as we manage it well, these advanced things will definitely not be bad." His thinking is very clear, knowing that the equipment designed by experts is advanced; temporary minor problems are due to poor management. Now he is the person in charge of the automated equipment in the basement, and he has become familiar with this new business with a spirit of hard work and serious research.

Old Du, who has carried sawdust for seven or eight years, has now changed his job. He smiled and held an oil pot to oil the sawdust scraper. He said: "In the past, carrying sawdust, especially when dealing with waterlogged wood (i.e., cutting newly felled logs), hurt my shoulders so much that it was really tough. Once, when he was putting sawdust on the belt, his jacket was suddenly entangled in the belt, tearing the jacket and scraping his back, it was extremely dangerous! Now it's really labor-saving to pour oil." Then he added: "Fortunately, he was wearing an old jacket that tore easily. If he was wearing a new jacket like this (pointing to the new jacket he was wearing) now, it would have been twisted into the belt."

The automated lumber mill was completed and started production in mid-April this year. This construction of the factory was the second time after liberation. It began its second construction in August 1952. This construction was started under the direct help of the Soviet lumber expert Comrade Bolovengen. In addition to adding some sawing machines and adjusting the position of the sawing machines to make it suitable for the assembly line method, the expert also helped design a complete set of automated conveying equipment. However, because this factory construction plan was temporarily added, there was not enough time for detailed design, and a mechanical configuration plan became the only basis for factory construction. A large amount of ironwork could not be found in a factory that could process it for a while. The chains of the lumber selection yard and most of the board scrap conveying chains, totaling more than 1,200 meters, were all made by their own open hearth furnaces. More than six hundred large and small axle bars (including automatic roller axle bars) were also turned by the three lathes that they bought successively. There were also more than 240 tons of ironwork that had to be sand cast in factories. Because they were all temporarily squeezed into other people's plans, people could not guarantee completion on time. Today, one piece is completed and installed today, and one piece is completed and installed tomorrow. Moreover, because the processing factories are scattered, the specifications cannot be completely consistent. Ninety percent of the ironwork has to be turned on a lathe again, otherwise it cannot be assembled. Thanks to the active efforts of the workers, all difficulties were overcome. When the work was the most tense, the lathe class implemented a three-shift system, and the record of one group (i.e., three hammer workers) of the open hearth furnace making chains reached 19 meters, and the general record was 3 to 4 meters. In this way, working day and night for eight and a half months, the automated lumber mill was finally victoriously completed. Under normal circumstances, building such a lumber mill, from planning, material preparation, starting construction to completion (because the old factory base was used, the survey was omitted), would take at least a year. The early completion under such difficult conditions is inseparable from the enthusiastic assistance of Soviet experts and the active efforts of all factory construction employees.

IV

The automated lumber mill has been completed and started operation, but in this automated lumber mill, you really can't see any brand-new machines, or huge machines. Therefore, from the beginning of construction to the complete completion, many people have different opinions on the automation of the lumber mill, and even some leading comrades hold a skeptical attitude towards automation. Some said: "The sawdust scraper, the Yichun lumber mill has repaired it, but it didn't work well. Can it work well if it is repaired in Jiamusi?" Some people said: "The automatic roller thing is bullshit. I guarantee that it will fall off after passing five rollers." Some people said: "The conveyor belt is also useless, because the rollers below are made of wood, and they will definitely be crushed by the large timbers." Still others believe that: "Automation is useless, it can't save much labor, it's taking off your pants to fart, it's a waste of effort. If you want automation, you should show it off. All the sawing machines should be new and large. How can repairing old machines be coordinated with automation."

However, after the automated lumber mill started operation, the vivid facts refuted these backward opinions.

    一个自动化制材厂的建立
    王凤翥
    一
    木排一张接着一张地靠拢在佳木斯的松花江南岸。出河机呼隆呼隆地把笨重的大木头一根一根送到岸上来。在这里老远就可看见“同志们，战斗开始了，前进吧！建设祖国。”的大标语，特别是“建设祖国”四个字，写得格外大些。辛勤的林业工人和转业的战士们，像标语写的那样，以战斗的姿态在紧张地工作着。再向前走，便是不久前才建立的一个自动化制材厂。
    二
    这里除了操纵机器的工人外，只有稀稀落落的几个输送料子（大带锯给小带锯破好的大块木材俗称料子）的工人，站在自动滚子的一旁，毫不费力地把料子推到滚子上，料子自动地爬到它的顾主——小带锯那里去。几个投板皮（不能割成材的碎小边皮）的工人，轻松愉快地把板皮投到地下室的板皮输送链子上，板皮便被输送到工厂外面去。这里没有一般工厂所常见的：抬着料子东奔西走及扛着板皮满厂乱窜的现象。所以工作秩序井然，工人工作轻松愉快。
    九号小带锯的技工方春山，从建厂时起就在这个工厂里工作。在建厂阶段掀起的两次生产竞赛中，他都当选了劳动模范。现在他愉快地割着从自动滚子上爬来的料子，这些割好的成材通过自动滚子爬到输送带上，一直输送到选材场去。他对我说：“你看咱们这个自动化工厂，减轻了很多体力劳动。”搭刨勾的（用刨勾搭大带锯破的料子）老刘头说：
    “自动滚子可真好，过去搭大料子，用很大劲，都拉不动，有时还弯坏了锯条；现在可真省劲啦，用手轻轻一拉，料子就上了自动滚子。”这里的选材场也改变了面貌，枕木和大的桥梁大方材等都在输送带的尽端直接装在平车上，由运材工运到贮材场去，一般的成材都从输送带落到选材台的自动链子上，自动链子拖着成材徐徐前进。产品鉴定员站在台前不慌不忙地翻弄着成材，按照国家规定的标准分好等级；再不像过去几平车木材，同时推进选材场，使产品鉴定员有时忙得满头大汗，有时闲着无事可做了。忙闲不均的现象，现在根本没有了。选材工排列在选材台前，他们各人站在固定的岗位上把分好等级的成材，按材长、树种分别装在平车上。由于成材是在自动链子上连续不断的走来，所以在时间上及工作分量上，分配得很均匀。
    地下室设置的锯沫刮取器，纵横贯通于各个锯木机间，最后把锯沫输送到锅炉里去。在制材厂干了二十一年的老工人尹忠先想尽一切办法，消除自动化设备可能发生的故障。开始开动锯沫刮取器时，常因树皮或小木片等落在锯沫里，致使刮取器的铁环不能挂在牙轮上而掉了链子。尹忠先为了解决这一问题，给各锯木机的锯沫流子（锯沫从流子流到锯沫刮取器的槽子里），都装设上了铁丝网，使树皮和小木片不能再混到锯沫里去，锯沫刮取器就顺利地开动起来了。他说：“苏联专家设计的这些自动化设备都好使，就看我们管理和使用的怎么样了，只要我们好好的管理，这些进步的玩艺是绝对不会不好使的。”他的思想很明确，知道专家设计的装备都是先进的；临时发生的小毛病，是由于管理得不好。现在他是地下室自动化设备的专责人，他以埋头苦干认真钻研的精神熟悉了这项新的业务。
    抬了七、八年锯沫的老杜头，现在改行了，他笑眯眯地端着油壶在给锯沫刮取器浇油，他说：“过去抬锯沫子，遇到割水木头的时候（即割新出河的木头）压得肩膀直疼，实在够呛。有一回他钻皮带装锯沫子，小褂子一下缠到皮带上了，扯破了小褂，擦破了后脊背，危险透啦！现在浇浇油可真省劲。”接着他又补充说：“那回幸而穿的是旧小褂一扯就坏了，如果穿的是像现在这样的（指着他身上的新小褂）新小褂，那就被绞到皮带里去了。”
    三
    自动化制材厂是今年四月中旬修建竣工开始生产的，修建这个工厂，已经是解放后的第二次了。它在一九五二年八月间才开始了第二次修建。这次修建是在苏联制材专家波洛文根同志的直接帮助下开始的，除了增加部分锯木机械及调整锯木机的位置使它适合流水作业方式外，并由专家协助设计出整套的自动化输送设备。但是由于这个建厂计划，是临时追加的，所以没有充足的时间进行细致的设计，一张机械配置平面图，成了建厂的唯一根据。大量的铁活一时找不到可以加工的工厂，选材厂的链子及大部分板皮输送链子，共计一千二百多公尺，都是由自己的洪炉打成的。大大小小六百多根轴杠（包括自动滚子轴杠在内），也是靠了自己先后买的三台床子镟成的。还有必须找工厂翻砂的二百四十多吨铁活，因为都是临时挤到人家计划里去的，人家也不能保证按时完成。今天完成一件今天安装一件，明天完成一件明天安装一件，更因加工的工厂分散，在规格上不能完全一致，百分之九十的铁活都要再经镟床镟一遍，不然就不能把它装配起来。由于工人们的积极努力，克服了所有的困难。工作最紧张的时候，车床班实行了三班制，洪炉一个组（即三个锤工）打链子的纪录达到十九公尺，一般的纪录是三公尺到四公尺，这样不分昼夜干了八个半月，终于将这座自动化制材厂，胜利地修建完成了。按一般正常状态，修建一所这样的制材厂，从计划、备料、开工到竣工（因用旧厂基省略了勘察），至少也需要一年的时间。在这样困难的条件下提前竣工，是和苏联专家的热诚协助及全体建厂员工的积极努力分不开的。
    四
    自动化制材工厂是修建完成并且开工了，但是在这个自动化制材厂里的确看不到什么崭新的机器，或是巨大的机器，因此从开始修建到完全竣工，很多人对制材厂自动化的问题有不同意见，甚至某些领导同志也对自动化抱着怀疑的态度，有的说：“锯沫刮取器，伊春制材厂曾经修过，结果是不好使，修在佳木斯就能好使吗？”有的人说：“自动滚子那玩艺是瞎扯蛋，保险走不过五个滚子就会掉下来。”有的说：“运输带也是白扯，因为它下边的滚子是木头的，被大方材一砸，保险会砸垮。”更有的认为：“自动化没有用，节省不了多少劳动力，是脱了裤子放屁，白费一遍手续。要自动化就应该化出个样子来，锯木机就应该全用新的和大的，修理旧机器，怎能和自动化去配合。”
    但是，在自动化制材厂开工后，活生生的事实把这些落后的意见都驳倒了。
