Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 5th—Yusuf, Vice-President of the All-India Trade Union Congress and head of the All-India Trade Union Congress delegation, who was invited to China to attend the "May Day" celebrations and the Seventh National Congress of the Chinese Trade Union, delivered a radio speech in Guangzhou on the 3rd, narrating his impressions of visiting China.

Yusuf said: I have traveled in this country for a month, visiting China's rural areas and industrial cities. As a result of land reform, the lives of Chinese peasants have undergone tremendous changes. I visited many rural areas near Beijing and Shenyang, where peasants lived in poverty before liberation, and now they are well-fed and clothed. They live in newly built houses, and their children can go to school. Now the government continues to provide loans and seeds to the peasants and helps them improve agricultural tools and build water conservancy projects—such as the harnessing of the Huai River and the Guanting Reservoir. The peasants are working on their own land with great enthusiasm. They have organized thousands of mutual aid teams and agricultural producers' cooperatives and are actively organizing collective discussions on improving agricultural production methods.

Yusuf then spoke about China's current tremendous efforts for national industrialization. He said: I visited several factories in Shenyang, Fushun, and Shanghai. Shenyang and Shanghai are now able to manufacture heavy-duty machine tools such as high-speed automatic lathes. Factories that were doing repair work before liberation are now being transformed into large manufacturing plants. Many model workers have emerged from the labor emulation movement, and the new tricks they have discovered have been adopted in these factories. I am deeply impressed by the fact that the factories and the government pay special attention to improving working conditions and ensuring worker safety. For example, safety covers are installed on the wheels, and air conditioners are installed in the factory workshops. The government allocates a huge amount of money every year for the construction of workers' housing. Many workers have moved into very good houses with modern public health facilities. In addition, the Chinese government has established public recreation centers and hospitals for workers and established workers' sanatoriums in famous resorts. Thousands of students from worker-peasant backgrounds have entered universities for free study.

Chinese women enjoy the same treatment as men. Female workers receive the same wages as men under the principle of equal pay for equal work, and female workers have also appeared in some departments requiring a high degree of skill.

Yusuf emphasized: The Chinese people are engaged in peaceful construction with patriotic enthusiasm in order to industrialize their motherland. Therefore, they love peace above all else and strive to defend world peace.

    赞扬新中国从事和平建设的巨大成就
    【新华社广州五日电】应邀前来我国参加“五一”节庆祝典礼和中国工会第七次全国代表大会的全印总工会副主席、全印总工会代表团团长优素福于三日在广州发表广播演说，叙述他访问中国的观感。
    优素福说：我在这个国家旅行了一个月，访问了中国的农村和工业城市。由于土地改革的结果，中国农民的生活已发生了巨大的改变。我访问了北京和沈阳附近的许多农村，那里的农民在解放前过着穷困的生活，现在已经丰衣足食了。他们住着新盖的房子，子女也能入学。现在政府还不断贷款、贷种子给农民，并帮助他们改良农具和兴修水利——例如兴修淮河和官厅水库。农民们在自己的土地上劳动，产生了极大的热情。他们组织了几千个互助组和农业生产合作社，并且积极地组织各种关于改进农业生产方法的集体讨论。
    优素福接着谈到中国目前正在为国家工业化而进行着巨大的努力。他说：我在沈阳、抚顺和上海访问了几个工厂。沈阳和上海已能制造高速度自动车床等重型工作母机。解放前还是做修理工作的工厂现在正被改造为大的制造厂。从劳动竞赛运动中已涌现出许多的模范工人，他们所发现的新窍门都在这些工厂里采用了。我对于厂方和政府特别注意改进工作条件保障工人安全这一点有很深的印象。例如在轮带上安安全套，工厂车间安空气调节器等。政府每年都拨出一笔巨款，作建设工人住宅之用。许多工人搬进了很好的有现代化公共卫生设备的房子。此外，中国政府还为工人们设立了公余休息所、医院，并在各著名的疗养地设立了工人疗养院。成千的工农出身的学生已免费进入高等学校学习。
    中国妇女享受着和男子同等的待遇。女工们在同工同酬的原则下，得到和男子一样多的工资，在一些需要有高度熟练性的工作部门中也出现了女工。
    优素福强调说：中国人民正在怀着爱国的热情从事和平的建设，以便使他们的祖国工业化。因此，他们热爱和平超过一切，并且极力保卫世界和平。
