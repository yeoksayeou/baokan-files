Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, June 18th: According to the German News Agency, Berlin, June 17th: The Politburo of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED) has issued a communiqué in response to questions raised by workers from various factories and construction sites. The communiqué states: Establishing a new life and improving the living conditions of workers and all people is only possible on the basis of increasing labor productivity and increasing production. Only by realizing the slogan put forward by the SED, "Increase production, improve life," can the economy of the German Democratic Republic be rebuilt and rapidly developed. Therefore, the Politburo believes that the initiative of advanced workers to voluntarily increase production quotas is a decisive step in building a new life, pointing out the way out of the current difficulties for all the people.

However, the Politburo also believes that it is completely wrong to use administrative measures to increase production quotas by 10 percent. Increasing production quotas cannot and should not be implemented by administrative methods, but only on a voluntary basis or by persuasion. Therefore, it has been proposed to revoke the practice of individual government departments increasing production quotas. The decision jointly taken by the government and trade unions on May 28, 1953, will be re-examined.

At the same time, the Politburo calls on workers to join the Party and the government in exposing those hostile elements who attempt to sow confusion and unrest in the ranks of the working class.

Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, June 18th: TASS, Berlin, June 18th: On June 16th, work stoppages occurred in several industrial enterprises in the democratic sector of Berlin, especially among construction workers. The pretext for the work stoppages was the measure, now rescinded by the government of the German Democratic Republic on June 16th, that had been implemented in some enterprises in recent days to increase production quotas by 10 percent. However, the increased quota was merely a pretext for foreign special agents lurking in West Berlin, provocateurs who organized work stoppages in industrial enterprises and riots on the streets of Berlin.

Therefore, the government of the German Democratic Republic issued a notice on the afternoon of June 17th, which stated:

"Fascists and other reactionary elements in West Berlin are using provocative actions and serious disruptions of order in the democratic sector of Berlin to counter the measures taken by the government of the German Democratic Republic aimed at improving the living conditions of the people.

The purpose of these provocative actions is to obstruct the reunification of Germany. Due to yesterday's decision regarding production quotas, the pretext for the Berlin construction workers' work stoppage is no longer valid.

The disturbances that have occurred are instigated by foreign provocateurs and fascist special agents, as well as their accomplices among German monopoly capitalists. These forces are dissatisfied with the democratic government of the German Democratic Republic, which is improving the living conditions of the people. The government calls on the people:

1.  To support measures to immediately restore order in the city and create conditions for the normal and peaceful work of industrial enterprises.

2.  Those responsible for the disturbances will be brought to trial and severely punished. Workers and all honest citizens should immediately arrest and hand over to state organs any provocateurs they encounter.

3.  Workers and technical intellectuals should cooperate with the authorities to take the necessary measures to ensure normal work."

This announcement to the people by the government of the German Democratic Republic was signed by Otto Grotewohl, Prime Minister of the German Democratic Republic.

That evening, the government of the German Democratic Republic issued a notice declaring the failure of the adventure launched by foreign agents in Berlin. The notice stated:

"Just as the government of the German Democratic Republic was about to take new and important measures to try to improve the material conditions of the people and pay special attention to improving the conditions of the workers, mercenary elements, foreign special agents, and their accomplices among German monopoly capitalists attempted to undermine the government's measures.

It has been confirmed that the strikes that occurred yesterday in certain industrial enterprises and the provocative riots on the streets of the democratic sector of Berlin by several groups of fascist special agents were carried out according to a unified plan formulated in West Berlin and were indeed well-timed. The result of this illegal action is the complete failure of the adventure, because it was met with resistance from the majority of the residents and the authorities.

Normal work has resumed in industrial enterprises. Order has been restored on the streets. No riots by provocateurs and criminals will be tolerated.

The despicable attempt by foreign special agents to obstruct the government from implementing important measures to improve the living conditions of the people, and the attempt to brew unrest in order to create obstacles to the reunification of Germany, has failed completely. The government of the German Democratic Republic will take forceful measures to severely punish those who disrupt order. Provocateurs should not expect to be forgiven."

    德国统一社会党政治局发表公报
    号召工人在自愿基础上增加生产改善生活
    特务分子在柏林民主区制造停工骚动失败
    【新华社十八日讯】据德意志通讯社柏林十七日讯：德国统一社会党政治局发表公报，答复一些工厂和建筑工地工人提出的问题。公报说：建立新的生活和改善工人以及全体人民的生活状况，只有在提高劳动生产率和增加生产的基础上才是可能的。只有实现统一社会党提出的口号“增加生产，改善生活”，才能使德意志民主共和国人民的经济得到重建和迅速的发展。因此，政治局认为，先进的工人们自动发起提高生产定额，是在建设新的生活方面的一个有决定意义的步骤，它给全体人民指出了脱出目前困难的道路。
    但是，政治局也认为，用行政措施来提高生产定额百分之十是完全错误的。提高生产定额不能够也不应该以行政方法来实行，而只能在自愿的基础上或用说服的方法来达到。因此，已提出把个别政府部门提高生产定额的作法撤销。政府和工会在一九五三年五月二十八日共同采取的决定将重新研究。
    政治局同时号召工人们和党及政府一起，揭发那些企图在工人阶级队伍中散布混乱与不安的敌对分子。 【新华社十八日讯】塔斯社柏林十八日讯：六月十六日，柏林民主区有若干工业企业中，特别是建筑业工人中有停止工作的情形发生。停止工作的口实是六月十六日德意志民主共和国政府已撤销了的、曾在最近几天在若干企业中实行的增加生产定额百分之十的措施。但是增加定额不过是潜伏在西柏林的、在工业企业中组织停工、在柏林街道上组织暴动的外国特务挑拨者的口实而已。
    因此，德意志民主共和国政府于六月十七日下午发表公告，公告说：
    “西柏林的法西斯分子和其他反动分子以在柏林民主区采取挑拨行动和严重破坏秩序的手段来对付德意志民主共和国政府所采取的旨在改善人民生活条件的措施。
    这些挑拨行动的目的是阻挠德国的重新统一。由于昨天的关于生产定额的决定，柏林建筑工人停止工作的口实就不能成立了。
    发生的骚动是外国挑拨者和法西斯特务以及他们在德国垄断资本家中间的同谋者挑拨起来的。这些势力对正在改善人民生活条件的德意志民主共和国民主政府感到不满。政府号召人民：
    一、支持立即恢复城市秩序及为工业企业的正常的、平静的工作创造条件的措施。
    二、应对骚乱负责的人们将付诸审讯并予以严惩。工人和一切正直的公民如遇见挑拨者应即加以拘捕，送交国家机关。
    三、工人和技术知识分子应该与当局合作，采取必要的措施来保证正常的工作。”
    德意志民主共和国政府向人民发出的这个公告是由德意志民主共和国总理奥托·格罗提渥签署的。
    当天晚上，德意志民主共和国政府发表公告，宣布柏林外国雇佣者冒险行动的失败。公告说：
    “正当德意志民主共和国政府要采取新的重要的措施来设法改善人民的物质条件并特别注意改善工人的条件时，唯利是图的分子、外国的特务和他们在德国垄断资本家中间的同谋者企图破坏政府的措施。
    业已证实，昨天在某些工业企业中所发生的罢工和若干批法西斯特务在柏林民主区街道上的挑拨性的暴动是根据在西柏林拟定的一个统一的计划实行的，并确是选好了时间的。这种非法行动的结果是冒险的全部失败，因为它受到了大部分居民和当局的反击。
    工业企业已恢复了正常工作。街上的秩序已经恢复。决不容许挑拨者和犯罪分子的任何暴动。
    外国特务阻挠政府实施改善人民生活条件的重要措施的卑鄙企图，和为了给重新统一德国制造障碍而酝酿骚乱的企图一样，已彻底失败了。德意志民主共和国政府将采取有力的措施，严惩那些破坏秩序的人。挑拨者不要想得到宽赦。”
