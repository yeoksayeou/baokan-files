Our newspaper work is ideological work. It should conduct ideological struggle in newspapers with high revolutionary enthusiasm and irreconcilability. And the best way to conduct ideological struggle is through criticism and self-criticism. However, when carrying out criticism and self-criticism, we must correctly grasp the principle of combining it with national construction tasks and actively and steadily unfolding it.

Why should criticism and self-criticism be combined with national construction tasks? Why should we adopt an active and steady approach? What are the standards for being active and steady? The "Decision on Launching Criticism and Self-Criticism in Newspapers and Periodicals" issued by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on April 19, 1950 (hereinafter referred to as the Central Decision) already contains profound elaborations and clear provisions. The Central Decision pointed out that in order to expose and eliminate the shortcomings and errors in our Party and the various tasks of the state, in order to complete the tasks of building a new China, and to attract the masses to openly and promptly launch criticism and self-criticism, especially criticism from below, it is even more prominent and important today. Therefore, the Central Decision specifically stipulates that an active and steady approach should be adopted, and the standard is that, on the one hand, a revolutionary attitude of warmly welcoming and resolutely protecting criticisms reflecting the opinions of the masses must be adopted. This is an important step to raise the consciousness and enthusiasm of the people and attract them to actively participate in the cause of national construction. On the other hand, correct criticism must be welcomed and led, while destructive criticism must be opposed. The practice of newspapers in various places in recent months has proved that criticism can be carried out more steadily and regularly when it is closely integrated with current work in accordance with this policy. The Northeast Daily is doing a better job in this regard.

Saying that the Northeast Daily is doing a relatively good job does not mean that it has no shortcomings. For example, in the March 4th Northeast Daily's report on "Anshan Iron and Steel Comprehensive Inspection of Basic Construction Preparatory Work," it was proposed that the struggle against bureaucracy should be closely combined with current work, but this was not used as a starting point to actively and continuously publicize and criticize good and bad typical examples in the preparatory work of basic construction, in order to accelerate the completion of the preparatory work of basic construction. Another example is the criticism on March 4th of Anshan City's lack of emphasis on implementing the Marriage Law movement and the criticism on March 20th of the lack of depth in Anshan's spring patriotic health campaign. According to Anshan readers, these two criticisms are not appropriate enough. The newspaper attributed some shortcomings in the work of these two campaign offices to the leadership of the city not paying enough attention. The Anshan Spring Patriotic Health Movement was scheduled to begin on March 15th, but the newspaper criticized the city's leadership on March 20th for not rectifying the grassroots health organizations and not mobilizing the masses throughout the city.

Although the Northeast Daily has some shortcomings in carrying out criticism in combination with work, its criticism is still relatively frequent and relatively steady.

The reason why the Northeast Daily's criticism and self-criticism is carried out more frequently is because it pays more attention to combining it with national construction tasks. The reason why the Northeast Daily's reports on national tasks are relatively powerful is also because it pays more attention to grasping the spirit of active and steady criticism and self-criticism. This is first manifested in the criticism of the remaining supply system thinking and lack of economic accounting concepts in state-owned commercial departments, which began on December 3rd of last year with the "Woolen Overcoat Stockpile Incident." This criticism has continued to the recent reports on the commercial sector's inventory check, business management work, discussion of plans, and completion of the state commodity circulation plan and financial plan. In these reports, on the one hand, the newspaper criticized the commercial system for its unbalanced and incomplete inventory check, only clearing inventory but not purchasing goods, and failing to complete the April plan, etc., and pointed out that the commercial system must vigorously promote advanced experience and must effectively mobilize the masses to implement the inventory check to the end. On the other hand, it also appropriately commended the positive leadership of the commercial halls and bureaus of various provinces and cities in striving to complete the tasks for the second quarter, and the Fengcheng Department Store's example of combining anti-bureaucracy and anti-supply system remnants to fully mobilize employees to discuss plans. Secondly, in the reports combined with basic construction, from April 10th to the end of May, four short comments were published continuously, proposing that the phenomena of waiting, dependence, no one being responsible, waste, and neglecting project quality must be opposed. From May 15th, the newspaper opened a special column "Vigorously Oppose the Phenomenon of No One Being Responsible, Establish and Improve the Responsibility System," pointing out that in order to gradually overcome various phenomena of no one being responsible, all employees must establish the concept of the responsibility system and establish the necessary responsibility system. In other aspects, such as mobilizing the masses to discuss production plans to strengthen planning management, and in promoting the Zhaoyuan high-yield experience, comparative publicity and ideological criticism were carried out through good and bad typical examples. It is precisely because this is criticism aimed at actively and steadily improving our national construction, not destructive criticism, not criticism for the sake of criticism, that the criticism of the Northeast Daily has been carried out more frequently.

The Northeast Daily not only pays attention to combining national construction tasks and actively and steadily launching criticism and self-criticism, but also reminds the newspapers in various provinces and cities in the region in the form of "Newspaper Review" on April 4th and May 12th: Closely integrate with the current work to systematically launch criticism and self-criticism, and seize the main problems in the current work to organize reports on the anti-bureaucracy struggle.

The Northeast Daily has been able to achieve certain results in combining national construction tasks and actively and steadily launching criticism and self-criticism, mainly due to the following four reasons:

First, when the emphasis was re-emphasized in February this year on launching newspaper criticism, some newspaper editorial departments did not pay good attention to examining their own work and correcting the staff's understanding of criticism. Therefore, after the criticism was launched, it was either still weak and powerless, or rushed into things, or very infrequent. The editorial department of the Northeast Daily first examined its own work, and published its own "Inspection and Review on the Handling of Readers' Letters" on April 19th. In the review, it specifically pointed out that due to insufficient understanding of the profound significance of the Central Decision, "For a long time, we have adopted an attitude of excessively relying on the superior leading organs of those criticized to deal with the criticisms of readers' letters regarding the shortcomings in the work of our Party and government's economic organs." As a result, "Many major, universally significant, and principled criticisms or exposure letters have been missed or submerged in indefinite 'investigations'." "This approach is essentially to doubt the authenticity of mass criticism, and sometimes it is to compromise with the incorrect attitude of those who refuse to criticize the correct parts by pretexing that some facts are different, and hope not to publish them publicly in the newspaper and are willing to 'settle things privately'. This is clearly not in line with the spirit of the Central Committee of the Party." "Practical experience has also told us that the mass criticism letters that we have transferred 'from below' to the relevant authorities for reply often cannot be dealt with in a timely manner; some mass criticism letters are transferred to the hands of the criticized, resulting in retaliation against the critics. One of the reasons is that the criticisms that should be published have not been published in a timely manner, so that the criticized phenomenon is placed under the joint supervision of all relevant authorities and the broad masses, seeking a rapid and thorough solution to the problem." In the newspaper's editorial on March 14th, in addition to analyzing and criticizing the reasons why the past public mass criticism has not been carried out regularly and well, mainly due to the existence of liberalism and bureaucracy in the editorial department, it further proposed: "At the same time, in the situation where public criticism is increasingly carried out, we must, in accordance with the spirit of the Central Decision, educate all editors, reporters, correspondents, and the people to learn and be good at distinguishing between correct criticism and destructive criticism. The criticism we advocate is the principled, constructive, and well-intentioned criticism aimed at promoting and consolidating the cause of national construction. It is serious, realistic, and seeks truth from facts. It is to speak in the tone of comrades and the voice of the people, in order to further consolidate the unity of our team, and to oppose the opposite criticism, that is, the destructive criticism pointed out in the Central Decision: for the purpose of opposing the people's democratic system and the Common Program, for the purpose of undermining discipline and leadership, and for the purpose of undermining the confidence and enthusiasm of the people, creating pessimistic and disappointed emotions and scattered and divided states. Comrade Stalin pointed out in June 1928 that there was a bad tendency in the Soviet Union at that time, that is, 'to turn self-criticism into a means of slandering our economic workers, and a means of making them lose prestige in front of the working class.' This situation has not appeared in our newspapers and periodicals today, but we should pay attention to preventing it." It is precisely because the editorial department of the Northeast Daily paid more attention to inspecting and criticizing its own work, correcting its understanding of criticism, and attaching importance to mass criticism; therefore, in the recent period, it has been more frequent and appropriate in carrying out criticism in combination with work.

Second, in carrying out criticism in combination with work, some newspapers only pay attention to using typical events to educate cadres and the masses, but rarely pay attention to solving the ideological obstacles of cadres in carrying out criticism. The Northeast Daily pays more attention to criticizing various incorrect understandings of newspaper criticism ideologically and in principle, clearing the way for carrying out regular public criticism. For example, the editorials published on March 14th and April 19th, "Regularly Carrying Out Mass Criticism in Newspapers and Periodicals is a Powerful Driving Force for Promoting the Construction of Our Country" and "Launching Criticism and Self-Criticism from Below to Ensure the Victorious Completion of the National Economic Construction Plan," have repeatedly elaborated on the importance of carrying out mass criticism for national construction. In the former editorial, a deep analysis and sharp criticism was made of the various pretexts for refusing criticism. For example, in criticizing the pretext that "Internal resolution is better than public criticism," it was pointed out that the reasons supporting this incorrect argument were: "Public criticism will put the leadership in a passive position" and "Will hurt the emotions of cadres," etc. The editorial pointed out: "All these reasons come from the same ideological source: that is, to regard principled, constructive, and well-intentioned public criticism as a negative factor, and to obliterate its huge positive significance." "Many facts in the past have shown that some major principled shortcomings and errors can often not be 'resolved' only by 'internal resolution' without mass public criticism, and in a sense, it has also contributed to the development of shortcomings and errors, let alone educating the broad masses of cadres and giving play to the enthusiasm of the broad masses for the cause of national construction. On the contrary, when the people expose and criticize the shortcomings and errors of the leadership, it can often prompt the leadership to take effective measures to correct these shortcomings and errors. Why would it put the leadership in a passive position? If a leader is publicly criticized by the people and does not correct shortcomings and errors, then what is so terrible about them being 'passive'? A cadre who has been publicly criticized by the masses and sincerely corrects shortcomings and makes himself healthier should be in a good mood. Why would it 'hurt the emotions'? If this cadre refuses to correct shortcomings and errors and therefore makes 'emotions', then what is so precious about this unhealthy 'emotion'?" The editorial, after explaining with profound facts that in some of our Party's leading organs, there is a prevailing trend of adopting "internal resolution" for the shortcomings and errors of leading cadres, also pointed out at the same time: "Naturally, some of them can be resolved internally, and we do not need to bring any household affairs to newspapers and periodicals for criticism and discussion, but today 'internal resolution' has become a pretext for some people to prevent public criticism, which is a very noteworthy issue." Another example is when the editorial criticized the pretext that "Criticism from below is often not easy to be correct, so we must be particularly cautious and strictly review it," it pointed out: "On the surface, these comrades do not refuse criticism or suppress criticism, only for the sake of 'caution'." "However, the main intention of some comrades' 'caution' is not here. Deep in their minds, they still harbor distrust of the awareness and wisdom of the broad masses of workers and peasants today, thinking that their horizons are narrow, they cannot distinguish right from wrong, and they are prone to speak nonsense, or they are afraid of losing face in front of the masses by making public reviews, so in essence, they do not approve of mass public criticism, which is extremely wrong." The analysis and criticism of the above-mentioned pretexts in the editorials of the Northeast Daily have initially cleared the ideological obstacles in criticism, which has created more favorable conditions for newspaper criticism.

Third, whether newspaper criticism can be carried out correctly and regularly often depends on how some responsible cadres who are criticized treat the criticism of the Party newspaper. If a responsible cadre takes a revolutionary attitude of warmly welcoming and resolutely protecting this criticism, and makes a very correct public review, this is a great encouragement to mass criticism, and sets a good example for other criticized cadres, so that newspaper criticism can continue to be carried out smoothly. On the contrary, if he gets furious, or grabs on to individual facts in the criticism that are inconsistent and denies the spirit of the whole criticism, or takes an attitude of ignoring it, in short, as long as he does not take a warm welcome and resolute protection attitude, the criticism of the masses will be frustrated, and newspaper criticism will be interrupted or decline. The several responsible cadres criticized by the Northeast Daily have taken a revolutionary attitude of warmly welcoming and resolutely protecting the criticism of the newspaper. The Northeast Daily immediately praised these responsible cadres, published their public reviews in important positions, and specially wrote editorials for their reviews and added important editor's notes, so that readers could deeply appreciate from the correct attitude of these responsible cadres towards criticism how the Central Committee's decision on carrying out criticism and self-criticism was correctly implemented in the Northeast region, and thus greatly encouraged the mass self-criticism from below. For example, Comrade Han Tianshi, Secretary of the Anshan Municipal Party Committee, and Comrade Wang Xingrang, the former Minister of the Northeast Trade Department, etc., after being criticized by the newspaper, immediately made public reviews with an active and sincere revolutionary attitude (see the Northeast Daily on March 14th and 24th). Their reviews were not just dealing with the matter superficially, or just afraid of obliterating achievements and highlighting shortcomings, or just being meticulous about the details of the facts, but rather connecting with their thoughts, deeply exposing, analyzing the reasons, and proposing corrective measures. Therefore, the Northeast Daily, while publishing their reviews, also gave encouragement to their spirit of daring to conduct public self-criticism in the editorials and editor's notes. For example, the editorial published by the newspaper when it published Comrade Han Tianshi's review specifically pointed out: "The leading comrades of the Anshan Municipal Party Committee once made principled errors in treating newspaper criticism. Now they have reviewed this error with the responsible attitude of a Communist Party member, learned a lesson, and found a way to correct the error. We believe that this is correct. The People's Daily has made correct public criticism of the responsible comrades of the Anshan Municipal Party Committee, and the comrades of the Municipal Party Committee have also made public reviews. Will this weaken the prestige and strength of the Anshan Municipal Party Committee? This will never happen. After this criticism and review, we believe that the leading comrades of the Anshan Municipal Party Committee will definitely improve their political level, always pay attention to absorbing opinions and criticisms from the masses, and improve their work in a timely manner. In this way, it can only strengthen the prestige and strength of the Anshan Municipal Party Committee, and can only promote the Anshan Municipal Party Committee to achieve greater and more achievements in leading the large-scale construction of Anshan Iron and Steel, which is watched by the whole country." The editor's note added when Comrade Wang Xingrang's review was published pointed out:
    "This review is not just a review of the specific matter criticized by this newspaper, but rather excavates the ideological roots that caused the error from this matter, and then reviews other errors caused by this ideological root, and analyzes the seriousness and harm of these errors." The Northeast Daily took these comrades who adopted the correct revolutionary attitude towards newspaper criticism as prominent examples, which greatly encouraged the mass self-criticism from below to continue to be carried out in the newspaper.

Finally, and also the most important reason, whether newspaper criticism can be carried out correctly and regularly is almost entirely determined by the attitude of the Party committee towards newspaper criticism and mass criticism. The reason why the criticism of some newspapers cannot be carried out correctly and regularly is because the Party committee to which they belong does not actively lead and support newspaper criticism, does not timely educate and correct certain deviations of newspaper staff in criticism, and does not encourage newspaper staff to stubbornly adhere to correct criticism, that is, does not fully implement the revolutionary attitude of warmly welcoming and resolutely protecting newspaper criticism. The reason why the Northeast Daily can regularly combine with work and actively and steadily launch criticism is mainly because the Northeast Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China actively leads and supports newspaper criticism. The Northeast Bureau has always attached importance to using newspapers to conduct work guidance. In the past three years, it has held three provincial and municipal newspaper work conferences. At each conference, newspaper staff were educated that they must take up the weapon of criticism and self-criticism. After the struggle against bureaucracy was launched this year, the Northeast Bureau specially convened a symposium on provincial and municipal newspaper work at the end of February to examine the work of readers' letters and launch newspaper criticism. At the symposium, Comrade Li Zhuoran, Minister of the Propaganda Department of the Northeast Bureau, gave detailed instructions. After the newspaper work symposium, the Northeast Bureau also convened a meeting of provincial and municipal Party committee secretaries, and the issue of launching newspaper criticism was discussed at the meeting. According to the reflections on newspaper criticism at the meeting, the Northeast Bureau instructed the editorial department of the Northeast Daily to write the editorial "Regularly Carrying Out Mass Criticism in Newspapers and Periodicals is a Powerful Driving Force for Promoting the Construction of Our Country." In addition, in seriously dealing with the obstruction of criticism in the Anshan "Workers' Life" newspaper, etc., it also showed the Northeast Bureau's correct leadership and active support for newspaper criticism, which has played a decisive role in strengthening the ideological work of the Northeast Daily. "The strength of our newspapers and periodicals lies in the fact that the Communist Party leads it and guides all its activities. The further improvement of the mobilizing and organizing role of newspapers and periodicals in the cause of communist construction directly depends on the level of leadership of Party organs at all levels over newspapers and periodicals." (Ilyichev: Speech at the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union)

Regularly combining national construction tasks and actively and steadily launching criticism and self-criticism is still a beginning for our newspapers. At the same time, there are still some difficulties on the road ahead, which requires Party committees and newspapers in various places to absorb the experience of the Northeast Bureau and the Northeast Daily in correctly leading criticism and carrying out criticism in combination with work, actively and steadily and patiently improve criticism work, and gradually strengthen the level of ideological struggle of newspapers to promote the development of national construction.

专栏：报纸工作述评

    结合国家各项建设任务，积极而稳步地展开批评和自我批评
    我们的报纸工作是思想工作。它应以高度的革命热情和不调和性在报纸上进行思想斗争。而进行思想斗争的最好方法，就是批评和自我批评。但在进行批评和自我批评时，必须正确地掌握这样一个方针，即结合国家各项建设任务，积极而稳步地展开批评和自我批评。
    为什么开展批评和自我批评要结合国家各项建设任务？为什么要采取积极而稳步的方针？所谓积极而稳步的标准又是什么？远在中共中央一九五○年四月十九日发布的“关于在报纸刊物上展开批评和自我批评的决定”（以下简称中央决定）中，即已有深刻的阐述和明确的规定。中央决定中指出，为了揭露和消除我们党和国家各项工作中的缺点和错误，为了完成新中国建设的任务，吸引人民群众公开地及时地展开批评和自我批评，特别是自下而上的批评，在今天是更加突出地重要起来了。因而中央决定中特别规定要采取积极而稳步的方针，其标准就是，一方面必须对于反映群众意见的批评采取热烈欢迎和坚决保护的革命态度，这乃是提高人民群众的觉悟性和积极性，吸引人民群众踊跃参加国家建设事业的重要步骤；另一方面，必须欢迎和领导正确的批评而反对破坏性的批评。近数月来各地报纸的实践证明：凡能切实依据这一方针，密切结合当前各项工作的批评就开展得比较稳当和经常。在这方面，东北日报是作得比较好的。
    说东北日报作得比较好，并不是说没有缺点。如三月四日的东北日报，在“鞍钢全面检查基本建设准备工作”的报道中，就提出了反官僚主义斗争要与当前工作紧密结合，但并没有以此为起点对基本建设准备工作中的好坏典型事例，积极地连续地展开宣传和批判，以加速完成基本建设的准备工作。又如三月四日批评鞍山市不重视贯彻婚姻法运动和三月二十日批评鞍山春季爱国卫生突击运动不深入。据鞍山读者反映这两个批评是不够恰当的，该报把这两个运动办公室工作中所发生的一些缺点，都说成为是由于市的领导方面不重视的结果。而鞍山市春季爱国运动规定从三月十五日开始，而该报在三月二十日即批评该市领导方面没有整顿基层卫生组织，没有把全市群众动员起来。
    虽然，东北日报在结合工作开展批评中存在着一些缺点，但它的批评还是比较经常和比较稳重的。
    东北日报的批评和自我批评所以开展得比较经常，就是因为比较注意结合了国家各项建设任务。东北日报对国家各项工作的报道所以比较有力，也正是因为它比较注意掌握了积极而稳步的批评和自我批评的精神。这首先表现在从去年十二月三日以
    “绒衣积压事件”为起点而展开的对国营商业部门供给制思想残余和缺乏经济核算观点的批判。这个批判一直继续到最近对商业部门的清产核资工作、经营管理工作、讨论计划和完成国家商品流转计划与财务计划的报道中。在这些报道中，该报一方面批评了商业系统中清产核资工作不平衡不彻底、光清库不进货，以及未完成四月份计划等等缺点，并指明商业系统必须大力推广先进经验，必须切实发动群众把清产核资工作贯彻到底；另一方面，对各省市商业厅、局积极领导，争取完成第二季度任务，和凤城百货公司结合反官僚主义和反供给制思想残余，充分发动职工讨论计划等等范例，也进行了适当表扬。其次，在结合基本建设报道上，从四月十日到五月底，曾连续发表四次短评，提出必须反对等待、依赖、无人负责、浪费及忽视工程质量的现象。从五月十五日起，该报更辟了“大力反对无人负责现象，建立和健全责任制”的专栏，指明要逐渐克服各种无人负责现象，就必须全体职工树立责任制观念，并建立必要的责任制度。其他如在发动群众讨论生产计划加强计划管理方面，以及在推广肇源丰产经验方面，都通过好坏典型事例，进行了对比宣传和思想批判。正因为这是以积极而稳步地改善我们国家建设为目的的批评，而不是破坏性的批评，不是为批评而批评的批评，所以，东北日报的批评就开展得较为经常。
    东北日报不但自己注意结合国家各项建设任务，比较积极而稳步地展开批评和自我批评，而且还在四月四日和五月十二日两次以“报纸述评”的形式，提醒该区各省市报纸：要密切结合当前各项工作系统地展开批评和自我批评，要抓住当前工作中的主要问题组织反官僚主义斗争的报道。
    东北日报在结合国家各项建设任务，积极而稳步地展开批评和自我批评方面所以能获得一定的成效，主要是由于以下四个原因：
    第一、在今年二月再次强调提出开展报纸批评之初，有些报纸编辑部并没有很好注意检查自己工作，端正工作人员对批评的认识，因而在展开批评之后，不是依旧软弱无力，就是急躁从事，或者很不经常。东北日报编辑部首先检查了自己的工作，并在四月十九日发表了他们自己“关于处理读者来信工作的检查和检讨”，在检讨中更具体地指出，由于对中央决定的深刻意义认识不足，“长久以来，我们对读者来信对于我们党的政府的经济机关的工作缺点的批评，采取了过分依赖这些被批评者的上级领导机关处理的态度。”因而把“许多重大的、具有普遍意义的、原则性的批评或揭发信件被漏掉或沉没在无限期的‘调查’中”。“这种作法实质上是怀疑群众批评的真实性，有时是和那种藉口批评和事实的某些出入而拒绝批评的正确部分，希望不在报纸上公开发表而愿意‘私下了事’的不正确态度相妥协。这显然是不符合党中央决定的精神的。”“实际经验也告诉我们：经过我们这样‘从下面’转送有关机关查复的群众批评信件，常常并不能得到及时的处理；有的群众批评信件辗转落于被批评者之手，造成对批评者打击报复的事情不在少数。其中的一个原因，就是没有把应该发表的批评，及时地公开发表出去，使被批评的现象置于一切有关机关和广大群众的共同监督之下，求得问题的迅速彻底解决。”在三月十四日该报的社论中，除分析批判了过去公开的群众性的批评所以没有经常地很好地开展，主要是由于编辑部存在着自由主义和官僚主义等原因外，更提出：“同时，在公开批评日益开展的情况下，我们必须根据中央决定的精神，教育全体编辑、记者、通讯员和人民群众，学会与善于区别正确的批评与破坏性的批评。我们所提倡的批评是以促进和巩固国家建设事业为目的的、有原则性、有建设性的、与人为善的批评，是严肃的、实事求是的，是要用同志的语调、人民群众的声音来讲话，是为了更加巩固自己队伍的团结一致，而反对与此相反的批评，即中央决定中指出的：为着反对人民民主制度和共同纲领、为着破坏纪律和领导、为着打击人民群众前进的信心和热情，造成悲观失望情绪和散漫分裂状态的那种破坏性的批评。斯大林同志在一九二八年六月曾经指出苏联当时出现过一种不良的倾向，即‘把自我批评变为中伤我们经济工作人员的手段，变为使他们在工人阶级面前丧失威信的手段。’今天在我们报刊上并未出现这种情况，但我们应当注意防止。”正因为东北日报编辑部比较注意地对自己的工作进行了检查和批判，端正了对批评的认识，重视了群众批评；所以近一个时期在结合工作开展批评中，就作得比较经常比较适当。
    第二、在结合工作开展批评中，有些报纸只注意运用典型事件教育干部群众，而很少注意解决干部在开展批评上的思想障碍。东北日报更注意从思想上、原则上批判对待报纸批评的各种不正确认识，为开展经常性的公开批评清扫道路。如三月十四日和四月十九日发表的“经常在报刊上开展群众性的批评是推进我国建设事业的强大动力”，和“开展自下而上的批评和自我批评，保证祖国经济建设计划的胜利完成”等社论，就曾反复地阐述了开展群众性批评对国家建设之重要性。在前一篇社论中，对于拒绝批评的各种藉口，更作了深刻的分析和尖锐的批判。例如，在批判“内部解决比公开批评好”的藉口时指出，支持这个不正确论点的理由是：“公开批评会使领导处于被动”、“会损伤干部的情绪”等等。社论指出：“所有这些理由，都来自同一的思想根源：即把有原则性、有建设性、与人为善的公开批评看成是一种消极的因素，抹杀其巨大的积极意义。”“过去很多的事实说明：一些重大的带有原则性的缺点与错误，仅有‘内部解决’而没有群众性的公开批评，往往‘解决’不了，在某种意义上还助长了缺点与错误的发展，更谈不上教育广大干部与发挥广大群众对于国家建设事业的积极性了。反之，当人民群众揭发、批评了领导的缺点与错误，常能促使领导主动地采取有效办法来改正这些缺点与错误，为什么反而会使领导处于被动呢？如果一个领导者受到人民群众的公开批评，而不去改正缺点与错误，那末，他们‘处于被动’又有什么可怕呢？一个干部经过群众的公开批评，真诚地改正了缺点，使自己更健康起来，应当情绪很好，为什么反而会‘损伤情绪’呢？如果这个干部不肯改正缺点和错误，并因而闹了‘情绪’，那末，这种不健康的‘情绪’又有什么宝贵的呢？”社论在以深刻的事实说明目前在我们某些党的领导机关中，流行着对领导干部的缺点与错误采取“内部解决”的一种风气后，又同时指出：“自然其中有一些是可以内部解决的，我们也并不需要把任何一件家常事务都拿到报刊上来批评讨论，但今天‘内部解决’已成了某些人杜绝公开批评的藉口，这就成为很值得注意的问题了。”再如社论在批判“自下而上的批评往往不容易正确，因此要特别慎重，要严格审查”的藉口时指出：“从表面上看，这些同志并不拒绝批评、压制批评，仅仅是为了‘慎重’而已。”“但是有些同志‘慎重’的主要意图并不在此，他们思想的深处，还隐藏着对今天广大工农群众的觉悟与智慧不信任，认为他们眼光狭小，不能分辨是非，容易胡说乱道，或者怕自己在群众面前作公开检讨会丢面子，因而在实质上，他们并不赞成群众性的公开批评，这是异常错误的。”东北日报在社论中对于上述各种藉口的分析批判，初步扫除了批评中的思想障碍，这就为报纸批评创造了比较顺利条件。
    第三、报纸批评能否正确展开和经常化，还往往决定于一些被批评的负责干部如何对待党报的批评。一个负责干部受到了批评，如果他对这一批评是采取热烈欢迎和坚决保护的革命态度，进行了很正确地公开检讨，这就是对群众批评的很大鼓舞，并为其他被批评的干部树立了良好的榜样，使报纸批评能够继续顺利地开展下去。反之，如果他大发雷霆，或者抓着批评中个别有出入的事实而否认整个批评的精神，或者采取置之不理的态度，总之只要不是采取热烈欢迎和坚决保护的态度，群众的批评就会受到挫折，报纸批评就会中断或消沉下去。东北日报所批评的几个负责干部对报纸的批评是采取了热烈欢迎和坚决保护的态度的。东北日报对这些负责干部立即加以表扬，把他们的公开检讨刊登在重要地位；并且专门为他们的检讨写了社论，加了重要的编者按语，使读者从这些负责干部对待批评的正确态度中深深体会到党中央关于开展批评与自我批评的决定如何在东北地区正确地贯彻着，因而大大鼓舞了群众性的自下而上的批评。如鞍山市委书记韩天石同志和原东北贸易部部长王兴让同志等，在受到报纸批评后，即以主动、诚恳的革命态度，迅速作了公开检讨（见三月十四日、二十四日东北日报）。他们的检讨，既不是就事论事敷衍了事，也不是只怕抹煞成绩突出缺点，更不是斤斤计较枝节事实出入，而是联系思想，深刻揭发，分析原因，提出改正办法。因此，东北日报在发表他们的检讨同时，即在社论和编者按语中，分别对于他们这种勇于公开进行自我批评的精神，给予了鼓励。如该报在刊登韩天石同志的检讨时所发表的社论特别指出：“鞍山市委的领导同志，在对待报纸批评中曾经犯过原则性的错误，现在他们以共产党员的负责态度检讨了这个错误，取得了教训，找出了改正错误的门路，我们认为这样做是正确的。人民日报对鞍山市委的负责同志进行了正确的公开批评，市委的同志亦做了公开检讨，这样会不会减弱鞍山市委的威信和力量呢？这是绝不会的，经过这次批评与检讨，我们认为鞍山市委的领导同志定会把自己的政治水平提高一步，经常注意吸收来自群众的意见和批评，及时改进自己的工作，这样，只能是加强鞍山市委的威信和力量，只能是促使鞍山市委在领导全国注目的鞍钢的大规模建设中，取得更大更多的成就。”在发表王兴让同志的检讨时所加的编者按语中指出：
    “这个检讨不是仅仅在本报所批评的那一件具体事情上检讨了事，而是从这件事情发掘出造成错误的思想根源，进而检讨了这种思想根源所造成的其他错误，并且分析了这些错误的严重性和危害性。”东北日报把这些对待报纸批评采取正确的革命态度的同志，作为突出的范例，这就大大鼓舞了群众性的自下而上的批评在报纸上能继续展开。
    最后，也是最主要的一个原因，即报纸批评能否正确展开和经常化，几乎完全决定于党委对待报纸批评和对待群众批评的态度。有些报纸的批评所以不能正确展开和经常化，就是因为所属党委没有积极地领导和支持报纸批评，没有及时教育和纠正报纸工作人员在批评中的某些偏差，没有鼓励报纸工作人员顽强地坚持正确的批评，就是说没有充分贯彻对待报纸批评采取热烈欢迎和坚决保护的革命态度。而东北日报所以能经常结合工作，积极而稳步地展开批评，则主要是由于中共中央东北局积极地领导和支持了报纸的批评。东北局一向是重视运用报纸进行工作指导的。过去三年来曾召开过三次省市报纸工作会议，每次会上都教育报纸工作人员必须拿起批评和自我批评的武器。今年展开反对官僚主义斗争后，东北局又在二月底特为检查读者来信工作、开展报纸批评召开了省市报纸工作座谈会。在座谈会上，东北局宣传部部长李卓然同志作了详尽的指示。在报纸工作座谈会后，东北局又召开了省市委书记会议，会上并讨论了开展报纸批评的问题。根据会议上对报纸批评的反映，东北局指示东北日报编辑部写了“经常在报刊上开展群众性的批评是推进我国建设事业的强大动力”的社论。此外，如在严肃处理鞍山“工人生活”报批评受阻碍等等问题上，也都表明东北局正确领导和积极支持报纸批评的作法，对加强东北日报的思想工作曾起了决定性的作用。“我们报刊的力量就在于：共产党领导着它、指导着它的全部活动。报刊在共产主义建设事业中的动员和组织作用之进一步提高，直接取决于各级党机关对报刊的领导水平。”（伊里切夫：在苏联共产党第十九次代表大会上的发言）
    经常结合国家各项建设任务，积极而稳步地展开批评和自我批评，在我们的报纸说来还是一个开端。同时，前进的道路上仍存在着一些困难，这就需要各地党委以及各地报纸吸取东北局和东北日报正确领导批评和结合工作开展批评的经验，积极而又稳步地耐心改善批评工作，逐步加强报纸的思想斗争水平，以推动国家建设事业的发展。
