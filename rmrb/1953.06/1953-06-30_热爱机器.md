    Love Machines
    By Our Correspondent An Gang
    For the first time in their history, the Chinese people are installing highly automated machines for producing large-scale rolled steel and seamless steel pipes. Currently, some parts of these machines have successfully undergone "trial operation," others are undergoing "trial operation," and still others are having auxiliary equipment installed, parts configured, and are undergoing final cleaning of bearings, gears, and other mechanical equipment. In their diligent and arduous labor, the builders of Anshan Iron and Steel deeply feel: "One must love one's machines a hundredfold. Without a high sense of responsibility for and the utmost care for machines, it is impossible to get them running and producing."
    All the machines are transported from the equipment warehouse. The equipment warehouse is a temporary reception center for new machinery and equipment. The storage yard of the general warehouse for capital construction equipment is neatly arranged with the machinery and equipment of units such as the thin plate factory and the No. 7 blast furnace, such as large gears half the height of a person, crane beams as long as three railroad cars, and a large number of large rolling mills. They are arranged in rows on neat sections. In the past, the management personnel of the equipment warehouse lacked experience, and machines were unloaded as soon as they arrived, and then piled up together, which was very easy to damage. Now, they are learning the advanced Soviet method of dividing sections, dividing the placement areas of machines according to the total amount of equipment needed this year, the effective area for equipment placement, engineering units, and railway transportation line numbers, so that the new machines that have come from abroad after a long journey have obtained a clean, tidy, and easy-to-transport location. Those machines that are afraid of rain and prefer a dry environment, such as transformers, distribution boards, and switches, are classified and arranged in the warehouse. The most sophisticated instruments, such as theodolites, levels, and tachometers, are displayed on shelves like precious antiques. This matter may not seem strange. However, it shows that our custodians have undergone a major change in thinking. That is to say: to keep the machines in good condition, it is not enough to only understand loading, unloading, placement, transportation, and guarding the door and being careful with lights. One must also understand how to take care of the machines. The comrades of the Equipment Department call the word "保管" [bǎo guǎn: storage, safekeeping, take care of] "保养" [bǎo yǎng: maintain, keep in good repair, conserve], which is a
    correct and positive proposal. Because only by maintaining them well can they be managed well. Before the machines are transported, a thorough master plan for the placement of the machines must be prepared. Loading and unloading machines must be done gently, and be careful not to touch the machined surface of the machine. Mechanical equipment must be placed flat, and if it is slightly tilted, the machine will be deformed, the long shaft will be bent, and the center line cannot be found during installation. Once placed, attention must be paid to maintenance. Some equipment boxes must be coated with asphalt oil, and some must be wrapped with oil paint cloth. Precision instruments are delicate and must be kept at the normal temperature they need, and of course, dust must be prevented from entering. The personnel managing the equipment do a good job of loading, unloading, organizing, and maintaining the mechanical equipment, which can ensure that the machine is delivered to the construction site intact before installation.
    On the construction sites of large rolling mills and seamless steel pipe factories, Soviet experts are helping skilled workers clean and inspect machine ball bearings, and people watch the movement of the machines with surprised eyes. In the processing workshop of the seamless steel pipe factory, more than a hundred young workers in blue overalls are constantly wiping the machines and oiling the parts, and Soviet experts are guiding the workers in various experiments. Everyone takes great care of the machines.
    To take care of machines, one must understand what machines need most.
    Machines need to be clean. The oil holes in the oil pipes must not allow anything to enter. When the machine is running, a grain of sand flowing in will damage the gears, a thread may cause a machine failure, and a little bit of soil drilled into the friction surface will scratch a line. Soviet designers take into account the green areas outside the factory when designing the factory buildings, which can not only protect the workers' respiratory organs, but also prevent dust from entering the inside of the machine. Workers must develop the habit of regularly cleaning all parts of the machine. Soviet experts say: "People can take one or two fewer showers, but machine tools cannot be wiped for a day."
    Machines need to be beautiful. When you walk into the factory building of the seamless steel pipe factory, you can see all kinds of beautiful machines arranged in the spacious, sun-drenched, and well-ventilated factory building, giving people a common feeling: "The working conditions here are too good. It's really energetic to work." White tiles are laid in the main electrical room and the oil depot, which are as bright as mirrors, and people will slip if they walk on them carelessly. "To be beautiful, you have to dress up often." Once, when it wasn't wiped for three days, the ground was full of muddy lines. Soviet experts said: "If you can't make it beautiful every day, you should apply it with lime." The plane of the machine should always be as smooth as the surface of a piano, so that people can't bear to touch it with their hands. Machines cannot speak. If the owners take care of it in every possible way and give it life and beauty, it will definitely exert more effort in production.
    Machines need oil. Oil is the blood of machines. The lubrication system is the artery of automated machines. Tribology is the science of oils for machinery, which has become an important science in the Soviet Union. Machines need oil everywhere, machines need oil to run, cleaning needs oil, rust prevention needs oil.... Oil is the best protector of machines. Applying less oil to the machine is equivalent to reducing the life of the machine. New gears are rusted, and the rust must be wiped off when used. If the gears are worn, the new gears must be used as old gears. This is a big loss. Lubrication workers play an important role in capital construction. Their work cannot be checked. Only by continuously improving the enthusiasm for consciously loving the machine can the work be done well.
    One of the contents of the Party's capital construction political work is to enlighten cadres, technicians, and workers to consciously love machines, so that their thinking adapts to the conditions of modern highly automated machine production, and to change our handicraft, rural views and styles. Loving machines is the nature of the working class, but in the face of mechanized and automated new machines, the workers' old experience in maintaining machines cannot fully meet the needs of new things. Among the workers in capital construction, there are still a considerable number of farmers, who need to be continuously educated on the care of machines.
    All those who participate in the capital construction of the rolling mill should understand that the purpose of capital construction here is to build factories, increase machinery and equipment, and expand production capacity. Everyone should take care of the machines. Those who are in charge of the construction plan schedule should coordinate the machine installation with the progress of each engineering company to make a perfect plan, coordinate the work, and try not to interweave the machine installation with metal structures and house building, otherwise it may bring danger to the machine. Workers who pour concrete should understand that pouring is laying the foundation for the machinery production for a century-long plan. Ignoring the quality of the foundation will deform the machine. Workers installing cable pipes should understand that if the pipes are installed incorrectly and a wire cannot pass through,
    the entire machine will not be able to turn. People working on the rafters of the roof
    must always think about the machines below, and be careful to drop anything casually, which will damage the machine. Everyone has the responsibility to take care of machines, protect machines, and oppose brutal behavior towards machines. Some people see that the machine is big and strong, so they put things on it casually, and sometimes even put heavy things on it. Anyone who sees this phenomenon should stop it and tell them: "The foundation has a certain limit of pressure resistance, and the frame and roller table of the machine have a certain limit of load capacity. Putting other things on it will deform the machine and cause losses to production." Soviet experts said: "We are all doing this work for production, and production requires the use of machines, so we must protect the machines." "In the Soviet Union, everyone has a high sense of responsibility for the machine. If civil construction and metal structure units want to work in the airspace above the machine equipment, they must take the initiative to notify the mechanical installation department the day before to cover the machine with cloth to avoid dust falling."
    How to start loving machines? First of all, people must understand the importance of taking care of machines, and ask people with technical skills to explain machines to everyone, so that they can understand the structure and performance of the machines. Special attention should be paid to correcting some unrealistic views ideologically, such as some people only pay attention to the "size" of the machine, thinking that it is enough to put the machine on the foundation. In fact, "size" is only the shape of the machine. The other side of the machine is exquisiteness, such as electrical equipment, ball bearings, etc., which may not look big, but are decisive for machine production and must be taken care of doubly. Some people ignore the spare parts after the machine is installed, and even do not take care of the spare parts. A Soviet expert said,
    "Spare parts are the country's gold," and the lack of them will bring losses to production. Some people only pay attention to the huge main body of the machine, but do not pay attention to the care of the parts, thinking that the machine parts are nothing. However, Soviet experts repeatedly told us: "The value of the most ordinary parts or tools is much greater than the price of a watch." Treat every part of the machine with the mood of cherishing your own watch, and you can do a good job in taking care of the machine. You should learn more from Soviet experts in actual work, and never think that "this is a small problem, there is nothing to it." Soviet experts are right: "Don't think that the problem is 'small' and don't ask me, 'small problems' can
    develop into a fatal injury to the machine." For example, pre-assembly of the machine was originally a good thing. However, due to lack of experience in one place, they only paid attention to assembling the machine, and did not assign some apprentices to cover the cleaned equipment with tarpaulins, and also neglected to apply oil in time, and later had to re-clean and install it.
    The method of organizing mechanical installation suggested by Soviet experts also runs through the spirit of enlightening workers to consciously love machines. He suggested that before the machine installation project starts, a plan layout of the mechanical equipment should be made first, and divided into several construction sections according to different mechanical equipment, instead of adopting a swarm of installations. Each construction team should be fixed in a certain work area, and the installation workers should also be fixed, and should not move around casually. When the workload is reduced, people should be drawn out, but not the whole team, so that the work of the team continues until the machine is handed over to the production department. Soviet experts said: "This kind of organization method can make workers familiar with the machine, study the machine every day, and let the workers think about the machine even when they are sleeping." Fixing the work area and implementing the responsibility system for teams, groups, and people is a good way, which can enable workers to better care for the machines and ensure successful installation.
    Installing machines is for production. Production leaders and workers are the final owners of the machines. Large rolling mills and seamless steel pipe factories organized production institutions a long time ago, selected a group of workers and technicians, and worked with capital construction personnel to build the factory. The technicians and workers sent by Anshan Iron and Steel to the Soviet Seamless Steel Factory have completed their studies and are now unfolding training work. Production personnel must establish the closest relationship with the machine, carefully understand the machine during the construction process, study the drawings, learn to repair, adjust bearings, and adjust the operation of automatic devices, lubrication, and hydraulic systems. Because, after the machine is accepted, technical operation becomes the key that ultimately determines the fate of the machine. If operators and managers master the equipment performance and operating rules, it is possible to prevent all possible accidents, shorten the time for producing defective products at the start of operation, and enable the machine to contribute extremely high production volume at the start of operation.
    To take care of machines, one must resolutely oppose the phenomenon of no one being responsible and must establish a responsibility system. Comrade Stalin said: "What is the phenomenon of no one being responsible? The phenomenon of no one being responsible is to not bear any responsibility for the work undertaken and for machines, machine frames, and tools. When the phenomenon of no one being responsible prevails, there is of course no question of really improving labor productivity, improving product quality, cherishing machines, cherishing machine frames, and cherishing tools." The facts of Anshan Iron and Steel Construction also prove that we must conscientiously learn the spirit of Soviet experts loving machines and oppose the phenomenon of no one being responsible. We combine people's enthusiasm for taking care of machines with the specific organizational work of establishing a responsibility system, and we will definitely be able to do what Comrade Stalin said, "Cherish machines, cherish machine frames, and cherish tools."

    热爱机器
    本报记者  安岗
    中国人民在自己的历史上第一次安装起生产大型轧钢、无缝钢管的高度自动化的机器。现在，这些机器中各个部分有的已经“试运转”成功，有的正在进行“试运转”，有的正在安装附属设备，配置零件，最后清洗轴承、齿轮等机械设备。鞍钢的建设者们在辛勤艰巨的劳动中深切地体会到：“要百倍地热爱自己的机器，没有对机器的高度责任感和最大的关怀，就不可能使机器运转起来进行生产。”
    一切机器都是从设备仓库运来的。设备仓库是新式机器设备的临时招待所。基本建设设备总仓库的放置场上整齐地摆列着薄板厂、七高炉等单位的机器设备，如两人半高的大牙轮，长达三节火车车皮的吊车梁，为数甚多的大轧辊等。它们一行一行地排列在整齐的地段上。设备仓库的管理人员过去没有经验，机械来了就卸，卸了就放，堆在一起，非常容易损坏。现在是学习苏联先进的划分地段的方法，按照今年需要的设备总量，设备放置有效面积，工程单位，铁路运输线排号等划分了放置机器的地段，使从国外经过长途运转而来的新式机器都得到了干净、整齐、便于运送的地位。那些怕雨淋，喜欢干燥环境的机器如变压器、配电盘、开闭器等都被分类安排在库房里。最精密的仪器如经纬仪、水平仪、转数表等就像珍贵的古玩一样陈列在架子上。这件事看起来似乎并不稀奇。可是，这都表现出我们保管人员思想有了重大改变。就是说：要想把机器保管好，只懂装卸、放置、运送以及看管门户、小心灯火是不够的。还必须懂得如何爱护机器。设备处的同志们把“保管”二字称为“保养”，这是
    一个正确的积极的提法。因为，只有养好才能作到管好。机器运来之前，就要周到地作好放置机器的总平面图。装卸机器一定要轻拿轻放，千万不要碰着机器的加工面。机械设备一定要平放，稍一倾斜，机器就会变形，长的轴弯曲了，安装时就找不到中心线。放好了一定要注意保养，有的设备箱要上沥青油，有的要包上油漆布。精密仪器是娇贵的，必须保持它所需要的正常温度，当然更要防止灰尘侵入。管理设备的人员作好了机械设备的装卸、整理和保养的工作，就能够保证在安装前把机器完整无损地送到工地。
    在大型轧钢厂和无缝钢管厂的建筑工地上，苏联专家正在帮助技术工人清洗检查机器滚珠轴承，人们用惊喜的眼光观看着机器的转动。无缝钢管厂的加工车间，有着百余名穿着蓝色工人服的年轻工人们不停地擦机器，给机件涂油，苏联专家指导工人们作各种试验的工作。大家对机器真是爱护备至。
    爱护机器，必须懂得机器最需要的是什么？
    机器需要干净。油管道的油孔是进不得一点东西的，当机器转动的时候，一粒砂子流进去就会弄坏齿轮，一根线条也可能造成机器故障，一点点泥土钻进摩擦表面上，就会划成一条道子。苏联的设计家在设计厂房时都要考虑到厂外的绿化地，这不但可以保护工人的呼吸器官，而且还可以防止灰尘侵入机器内部。工人们必须养成经常清洁机器各个部件的习惯，苏联专家说：“人可以少洗一两次澡，可是机床却不能一日不擦。”
    机器要求漂亮。当你走进无缝钢管厂的厂房，你就可以看见那宽大的，阳光充足，空气流通的厂房里排列着各式各样漂亮的机器，给人们一个共同的感觉是：“这里的劳动条件太好了。干起活来真起劲。”在主电室，油库内都铺上了白瓷砖、光亮如镜，人走在上面不小心就会滑倒。“要漂亮就得经常打扮”，有一次三天没有擦，满地泥纹，苏联专家说：“如果不能天天弄得漂亮，就应该抹成石灰地。”机器的平面应当永远保持像钢琴表面一样的光滑，使人都不忍用手去摸它。机器是不会说话的。如果主人们百般地爱护它，赋予他以生命力和美感，它就一定会在生产上使出更多的力气。
    机器需要油。油是机器的血液。润滑系统是自动化机器的动脉。润滑学是关于机械用油的科学，这在苏联已成为一门重要的科学。机器到处需要油，机器运转要油，清洗要油，防锈要油……。油是机器最好的保护者。给机器少上了油，就等于减损机器寿命。新齿轮生了锈，使用时就必须擦掉锈，齿轮有了磨损，新齿轮就得当作旧齿轮来用。这是一个很大的损失。润滑工在基本建设中担任着重要职务，他们的工作无法检查，只有用不断地提高自觉的爱护机器的热情来进行工作，才能把事情办好。
    党的基本建设政治工作内容之一，就是要启发干部、技术人员和工人自觉地热爱机器，使自己的思想同近代化高度自动化机器生产条件相适应，改变我们的手工业的、农村的观点和作风。爱机器是工人阶级的天性，但在机械化自动化新式机器面前，工人们旧的维护机器经验已经不能完全适应新事物的需要。基本建设的工人中，还有着相当多的农民，更需要对他们不断地进行爱护机器的教育。
    应当使所有参加轧钢厂基本建设的人们懂得：基本建设的目的在这里就是盖工厂，增加机器设备，扩大生产能力。人人都应当爱护机器。掌握施工计划进度的人，应当把机械安装同各个工程公司的进度互相配合作出完善的计划，使工作协调，尽可能地不把机器安装同金属结构、铺房盖等工作交错一起，不然就可能给机器带来危险。浇灌混凝土的工人应当懂得浇灌是为机械生产打下百年大计的基础，忽视基础质量，就会使机器变形。安电缆管道的工人应当懂得，管子安错，一根电线穿不过去，
    就会使整个机器不能转动。在房梁屋架上工作的人
    一定要时时刻刻想到下面有机器，一不小心随便掉
    下一块什么东西，都会使机器受到损伤。人人都有责任爱护机器，保护机器，反对对待机器的粗暴行为。有人看到机器挺大，又结实，就随便往上面放东西，有时甚至把很重的东西都压在上边。任何人看见这种现象，都应当前去制止，告诉他们：“地基是有一定限度耐压力的，机器的架子、辊道都是有一定限度的负荷量的。把别的东西放在上边，就会使机器走形，给生产带来损失。”苏联专家说：“我们大家作这一切工作都是为了生产，生产就得使用机器，我们必须保护机器。”“在苏联，每一个人对机器都有着高度的责任感。土木建筑、金属结构单位如要在机器设备上空工作，一定要主动地在前一天通知机械安装部门用布把机器盖住，以免掉下灰尘。”
    爱机器，从何爱起呢？首先要使人们了解爱护机器的重要性，请有技术的人给大家讲解机器，了解机器的构造性能。要特别注意从思想上纠正一些不合实际的看法，如有人只注意到机器的“大”，认为把机器放在基础上就够了。其实“大”只是机器的体型。机器的另一面是精巧，像电气设备、滚珠轴承等，看起来不大，但对机器生产却有决定的意义，必须加倍爱护。有人看到机器安装好了，就忽视了备品，甚至对备品不加爱护。一位苏联专家说，
    “备品是国家的金子”，缺少了它，就会给生产带来损失。有人只注意机器庞大的主体，没有注意爱护零件，以为机器零件没有什么。苏联专家却反复告诉我们：“一件最普通的零件或工具的价值，要比一块手表的价钱大得多。”用珍爱自己手表的心情去对待机器的各个部分，就可以作好爱护机器的工作。应当在实际工作中多向苏联专家学习，千万不要自以为“这是小问题，没有什么”。苏联专家说得对： “不要以为问题‘小’就不来问我，‘小问题’可
    以发展成机器的致命伤。”譬如机器的预装配本来是件好事。但有个地方由于没有经验，只注意了装配机器，没有分配一些徒工用蓬布盖住已经清洗的设备，也忽视了及时擦油，后来只得重新清洗和安装。
    苏联专家建议的组织机械安装的方法，也贯串了启发工人自觉的热爱机器的精神。他建议在机器安装工程开始前，先作好机械设备的平面布置图，按不同的机器设备分成若干施工工段，而不要采用一拥而上的安装办法。要把每一施工的班组都固定在一定的工作区，安装的工人也要固定下来，不随便流动，工作量减少时，抽人不抽班，使班的工作一直坚持到把机器交给生产部门为止。苏联专家说：“这样的组织方法，可以使工人熟悉机器，天天研究机器，让工人睡觉时都想着机器。”固定工作区，实行班、组、人的责任制是一个好办法，它可以使工人们更好地爱护机器，保证安装成功。
    安装机器是为了生产。生产的领导者和工人们是机器的最后的主人。大型轧钢厂和无缝钢管厂都在很早以前组织了生产机构，选拔了一批工人和技术人员，同基本建设人员在一起进行建厂的工作。鞍钢派往苏联无缝厂学习的技术工人已经学成回来，正在展开训练工作。生产人员必须同机器建立最亲密的关系，在建设过程中认真了解机器，学习图纸，学会检修，调整轴承，调整自动装置、润滑、水压系统的操作。因为，机器验收完毕后，技术操作就成了最后决定机器命运的关键。操作和管理人员掌握了设备性能和操作规律，就有可能防止一切可能发生的事故，缩短开工时生产废品的时间，使机器在开工时能够贡献出极高的生产量。
    爱护机器，必须坚决反对无人负责现象并须建立责任制。斯大林同志说：“什么是无人负责现象呢？无人负责现象就是对所担负的工作以及对机器、机架和工具不负任何责任。在无人负责现象盛行时，当然谈不到什么真正提高劳动生产率，改善产品质量，爱惜机器，爱惜机架，爱惜工具的。”鞍钢建设的事实同样证明，我们必须认真学习苏联专家热爱机器的精神，反对无人负责现象。我们把人们爱护机器的热情同建立责任制的具体组织工作结合起来，就一定能够作到有如斯大林同志所说的，“爱惜机器，爱惜机架，爱惜工具”。
