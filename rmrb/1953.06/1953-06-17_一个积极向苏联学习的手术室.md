    An Operating Room Actively Learning from the Soviet Union
    Guan Yi
    The predecessor of the Dalian Hospital of the Harbin Railway Administration was the Dalian Joint Hospital of the China Changchun Railway. It was transferred to our government by the Soviet government free of charge at the end of 1952. This hospital had received significant assistance from Soviet medical workers and continues to actively learn from the Soviet Union. From 1946 to the end of 1952, with the help of Soviet medical workers, the hospital learned more than 60 advanced Soviet medical methods, such as tissue therapy, Novocaine block therapy, sleep therapy, painless childbirth, corneal transplantation, mud therapy, and so on. In addition, the hospital also learned many advanced Soviet hospital management experiences, such as the graded responsibility system for outpatient department heads and department directors, the specialized responsibility system for doctors, nurses, and other staff, the scientific management of highly toxic drugs, and post-mortem case reviews. These advanced medical methods and hospital management experiences are extremely valuable. Here, I will only introduce the learning situation and gains of the hospital's operating room from the Soviet Union. The operating room is one of the departments in the hospital that learns better from the Soviet Union, as the hospital's director, Zhao Jinlan, said: "The operating room staff's learning from the Soviet Union can be said to be an epitome of our hospital's learning from the Soviet Union to a certain extent."
    
    Eliminating Suppuration
    For a long period, the medical staff of the operating room of the Dalian Railway Hospital of the Harbin Railway Administration (hereinafter referred to as the Dalian Railway Hospital) had been troubled by the problem of suppuration in aseptic surgery. In the past, the suppuration rate of aseptic surgeries performed in the Dalian Railway Hospital's operating room averaged between three and five percent, meaning that three to five out of every hundred patients undergoing aseptic surgery would have wound suppuration. In order to spare patients the pain of suppuration, the medical staff of the Dalian Railway Hospital's operating room had consulted many English and American medical literatures, but they all stated: it is impossible to avoid suppuration in surgery. Even the aseptic surgery statistics tables of the so-called first-class university medical departments in England and the United States stated: the suppuration rate of aseptic surgery averages around three percent. It seemed that the problem of suppuration was unsolvable.
    
    However, the medical staff of the Dalian Railway Hospital's operating room found the solution to the suppuration problem in their learning from the Soviet Union, a solution that could not be found in English and American medical literatures. After learning advanced Soviet medical techniques and management experiences, the medical staff of the Dalian Railway Hospital's operating room have today completely eliminated suppuration. From the end of 1949 to January of this year, the Dalian Railway Hospital's operating room performed a total of 5,970 aseptic surgeries, and not a single patient's wound suppurated. This is a blessing for patients and a rare achievement in the medical field.
    
    The reason why the Dalian Railway Hospital's operating room eliminated suppuration is primarily due to the result of learning the Soviet medical ammonia hand-washing method.
    
    The ammonia hand-washing method is characterized by being effective, simple, and economical. This hand-washing method can kill bacteria on the surface and deep layers of the surgeon's skin, making the surgeon's hands more thoroughly disinfected, thus ensuring the patient's safety. In this regard, the generally recognized best modern hand-washing method—the Fürbringer method—cannot achieve this. In terms of time spent washing hands, the ammonia hand-washing method only takes about ten minutes, saving more than twenty minutes compared to the Fürbringer method. If there are patients requiring emergency surgery, this hand-washing method allows medical staff to perform surgery quickly. The amount of alcohol consumed by this hand-washing method, if calculated at three people washing hands at once, only requires 180 cubic centimeters of alcohol, which is more than 100 cubic centimeters less than the Fürbringer method. In addition to using the ammonia hand-washing method, the Dalian Railway Hospital's operating room also thoroughly disinfects the sutures, liquids (saline, etc.), equipment, and dressings used in surgery according to advanced Soviet experiences. Suture disinfection uses mercuric chloride instead of the previously used carbolic acid; liquid (saline, etc.) disinfection is changed from once every seven days to once every three days according to the suggestions of Soviet comrades, and it is stipulated that the flasks containing the liquids must be disinfected every time they are opened; the nurses in the operating room have also learned the Soviet specialized responsibility system, establishing three specialized responsibility groups for equipment, hand washing, and dressings, so that equipment and dressings are always kept strictly disinfected.
    
    In order to prevent bacteria from entering the operating room, the Dalian Railway Hospital's operating room has established strict scientific management systems. Personnel entering the operating room for surgery (including medical staff who are not from the operating room) must cover their hair, wear masks, and change into special disinfected coats, shirts, and slippers prepared by the operating room. The walls, ceilings, and even the radiator vents in the operating room are so clean that you cannot wipe out any dust with a clean white gauze at any time.
    
    The Soviet ammonia hand-washing method and advanced management systems have armed the Dalian Railway Hospital's operating room, keeping the operating room constantly in a sterile state; in this way, the patient will absolutely not be infected by bacteria during surgery, which is the fundamental guarantee for the Dalian Railway Hospital's elimination of suppuration.
    
    The Process of Practice
    For a long time, the medical staff of the Dalian Railway Hospital's operating room believed in the backward and conservative conclusions in English and American medical literatures, believing that the surgeon's hands could not be steamed or boiled, and therefore could not be thoroughly disinfected, so it was impossible to avoid suppuration in aseptic surgery. When the Soviet surgeon Libatova first introduced the ammonia hand-washing method that could eliminate suppuration to them, they expressed doubt. Some senior doctors said: I have been working in medicine for decades, and I have consulted so many English, American, and Japanese medical literatures, but I have never seen a hand-washing method that can prevent suppuration. Can the ammonia hand-washing method have such great efficacy? But Dr. Libatova had always been very enthusiastic in mobilizing everyone to adopt the ammonia hand-washing method, and explained in detail the advantages of the ammonia hand-washing method. So some people said: According to English and American literatures, suppuration cannot be avoided forever, and the patient's suffering can never be relieved; but what we hear from the Soviet comrades is not this pessimistic conclusion, but words that encourage progress and concrete methods, so why not try to adopt the Soviet method? So they started to learn the ammonia hand-washing method with a half-believing and half-doubting attitude. The director of the operating room studied the literature while doing bacterial culture comparisons between the ammonia hand-washing method and the Fürbringer method, which he had always considered the best. Just as they took the first step in learning the ammonia hand-washing method, the medical staff of the Dalian Railway Hospital's operating room were immediately attracted by the Soviet literature on the ammonia hand-washing method. The Soviet medical literature stated: In 1926, the Soviet medical doctor Spasokukotsky successfully researched the ammonia hand-washing method. From 1927 to 1930, he used the ammonia hand-washing method for a total of 3,800 major and minor surgeries, none of which suppurated. The medical staff of the Dalian Railway Hospital's operating room saw such an achievement for the first time. These powerful scientific facts encouraged them to engage in further practice, and further practice gave them greater education and encouragement. The medical staff of the Dalian Railway Hospital first used the ammonia hand-washing method to perform several minor surgeries, and the patients' wounds did not suppurate. Then they performed several major surgeries, and they also did not suppurate. One doctor used the ammonia hand-washing method to perform a surgery for appendicitis that had already suppurated, and unexpectedly, the wound did not suppurate either. The greater the achievements, the greater the confidence of the medical staff in the operating room. At first, they did not dare to completely abandon the Fürbringer method. Later, they resolutely abandoned the Fürbringer method and completely adopted the ammonia hand-washing method. Because the ammonia hand-washing method disinfects more thoroughly, they generally do not wear rubber gloves except for surgeries on the bones and head.
    
    Learning from Soviet Comrades' Advanced Medical Thought and Work Style
    The medical staff of the Dalian Railway Hospital's operating room deeply felt that the reason they were able to quickly accept advanced Soviet medical technology and establish strict scientific management systems was the result of being deeply influenced by the Soviet medical workers' thought style of always considering the patients' needs. Take the operating room's hygiene management system as an example. In the past, the Dalian Railway Hospital's operating room was accustomed to doing a major cleaning once or twice a week, but the former Soviet director, Chernysheva, required them to clean every day and keep it spotless. Chernysheva often came to the operating room after work to check the hygiene. She carefully wiped every place with a clean white gauze, and if she wiped out any dust, she would leave the gauze on the table and leave a note that read: Comrades: There is still dust in the operating room. Can we perform surgery on patients in this condition? Can we prevent patients from being contaminated? Can we ensure that patients are discharged from the hospital in good health? If she could not wipe out any dust anywhere, she would also leave the gauze and leave a note to encourage the staff. Chernysheva's responsible spirit and meticulous work style deeply moved the staff of the Dalian Railway Hospital's operating room. Therefore, they established a hygiene team and stipulated that they must thoroughly clean at least twice a day. For several years, this hygiene system has been adhered to, so that every place in the operating room is spotless at any time.
    
    The head nurse of the Dalian Railway Hospital's operating room, Chi Xinlan, told me such a moving story: Once, the Soviet surgeon Libatova, who had worked with her and had returned to her country, came to Dalian again. After Libatova got off the train, she did not first return to her home in Jin County, but was concerned about her work and went to the hospital first. The director told her that her husband was ill. She was very worried. But when she heard that a patient with an ulcer (Shi Youyuan, a worker in the Dalian Railway Property Section) was in a dangerous state and was undergoing surgery, she hurried to the operating room to assist other surgeons in performing the surgery. In the process of performing the surgery, when the patient needed a blood transfusion, Dr. Libatova immediately donated 300 cc of her own blood to the patient. She worked nervously from a little after 11:00 AM until a little after 3:00 PM. After the patient was out of danger and the surgery was completed, she felt that she was already very tired and hungry, because she had not eaten anything from the time she got off the train in the morning until now. Chi Xinlan said: "Dr. Libatova's spirit of selflessness is indeed worthy of our learning. In the past, we worked with Soviet medical workers, and the education they gave us was really not small." Indeed, Soviet medical workers have set a brilliant example of revolutionary humanitarianism of selflessness and saving lives for Chinese medical workers. Under the influence of this example, Chinese medical workers have also demonstrated a good work ethic. June of last year was the busiest month for the operating room. In addition to the surgeries performed during the day, there were 26 emergency surgeries in that month. Most of the emergency surgeries were at night. Because there were few people (the operating room only had one head nurse, three nurses, one orderly, and six doctors, and these six doctors also had to take care of the outpatient clinic), the medical staff of the operating room still persisted in working during the day even after working the night shift. In that month, the staff of the operating room worked almost day and night. The head nurse of the operating room said: "We should learn from the example of Soviet comrades. When patients need us, we can fulfill our responsibilities, and that is our greatest pleasure."

    一个积极向苏联学习的手术室
    关沂
    哈尔滨铁路管理局大连医院的前身是中长铁路管理局大连联合医院。它是于一九五二年年底由苏联政府无偿地移交给我国政府的。这所医院曾得到过苏联医务工作者的重大帮助，现在仍继续积极地向苏联学习。从一九四六年到一九五二年年底，在苏联医务工作者的帮助下，该院学习了六十多种苏联先进的医疗方法，如：组织疗法、卢佛卡因封闭疗法、睡眠疗法、无痛分娩法、角膜移植、海泥疗法，等等。另外，这所医院也学习了许多苏联先进的医院管理经验，如：门诊部长、科主任等的按级负责制，大夫、护士和其他工作人员的专责制，毒剧药的科学管理，死亡病案检讨书，等等。这些先进的医疗方法及医院管理经验都是极其宝贵的。这里只介绍该院手术室向苏联学习的情况及收获。手术室是该院向苏联学习较好的科室之一，正如该院院长赵禁婪所说：“手术室人员的向苏联学习，在某种程度上可以说是我们医院向苏联学习的缩影。”
    消灭化脓现象
    在很长的一段时间里，哈尔滨铁路管理局大连铁路医院（以下简称大连铁路医院）手术室的医务工作人员，曾为外科无菌手术上的化脓问题苦恼着。过去，大连铁路医院手术室所做的无菌手术的化脓率平均在百分之三到百分之五，也就是每一百个作无菌手术的病人中，有三个到五个病人的伤口要化脓。为了使病人避免化脓的痛苦，大连铁路医院手术室的医务工作人员曾翻阅过许多英美的医学文献，但那上面都这样写着：手术要避免化脓是不可能的。连英美的所谓第一流大学医学系的无菌手术统计表上也是这样写着：无菌手术的化脓率平均在百分之三左右。看起来，化脓问题似乎是没有办法解决的了。
    但是，从英美医学文献里找不到的解决化脓问题的办法，大连铁路医院手术室的医务工作人员在向苏联学习中却找到了。大连铁路医院手术室的医务工作人员在学习了苏联先进的医疗技术及管理经验之后，今天已彻底地消灭了化脓现象。从一九四九年年底到今年一月，大连铁路医院手术室共做了五千九百七十次无菌手术，其中没有一个病人的伤口化脓，这是病人的幸福，也是医学界少有的成绩。
    大连铁路医院手术室所以消灭了化脓现象，首先是学习苏联医学上阿母尼亚洗手法的结果。
    阿母尼亚洗手法的特点是有效、简便、节约。这种洗手法可以把手术者的手的表皮以及皮肤深层的细菌杀死，使手术者的手消毒较彻底，这样，就保证了病人的安全。在这方面，一般医务工作者一向所认为现代最好的洗手法——费尔布林格尔氏洗手法，是做不到的。在洗手化费的时间上，阿母尼亚洗手法只需十分钟左右，比费尔布林格尔氏洗手法要节省二十多分钟，如果有了需要急救动手术的病人，这种洗手法可以使医务工作者迅速动手术。这种洗手法所化费的酒精，如果洗一次手按三个人计算的话，只需一百八十公撮酒精，这比费尔布林格尔氏洗手法要节省一百多公撮酒精。除了采用阿母尼亚洗手法之外，大连铁路医院手术室实行手术所用的线、液体（盐水等）、器材、敷料，也都按照苏联的先进经验彻底消毒。线的消毒是以升汞代替了过去所用的石碳酸；液体（盐水等）的消毒，根据苏联同志的提议，由七天改为三天消毒一次，并规定盛液体的烧瓶每打开一次就要消毒一次；手术室的护士并学习了苏联的专责制，建立了器材、洗手、敷料等三个专责小组，使器材和敷料等经常保持严密的消毒。
    为了防止细菌进入手术室，大连铁路医院手术室规定了严格的科学的管理制度。进入做手术房间的人员（包括非手术室的医务工作人员），必须包严头发，戴好口罩，换上手术室特备的消过毒的大衣、衬衣、拖鞋等。手术室的墙壁、天花板以至暖气孔等地方，无论何时，如果你用洁白的纱布去抹，那都是抹不出一点灰尘来的。
    苏联的阿母尼亚洗手法及先进的管理制度等武装了大连铁路医院手术室，使手术室经常处在无菌的状态中；这样，就在施行手术时绝对不会使病人受细菌感染，这是大连铁路医院消灭化脓现象的根本保证。
    实践的过程
    大连铁路医院手术室的医务工作人员过去很长时期内曾相信过英美医学文献上的落后的保守的论断，认为手术者的手既不能蒸，也不能煮，当然也就不能彻底地消毒，因而外科无菌手术要避免化脓是不可能的。当苏联的外科大夫利巴托娃刚把可以消灭化脓现象的阿母尼亚洗手法介绍给他们时，他们曾表示怀疑。有的老大夫说：干了几十年的医务工作了，翻过了那么多的英美及日本的医学文献，也没看到过可以防止化脓的洗手法。阿母尼亚洗手法能有这样大的效用吗？但利巴托娃大夫却一直非常热诚地动员大家采用阿母尼亚洗手法，并详细地讲解着阿母尼亚洗手法的优点。于是有些人说：按英美文献的说法，化脓现象是永不能避免的，病人的痛苦永远也解除不了；但是从苏联同志那里所听到的，却不是这种悲观的论断，而是引人前进的话语和具体办法，那为什么不可以试着采用苏联的方法呢？于是他们抱着半信半疑的态度，开始学习了阿母尼亚洗手法。手术室主任一面研究文献，一面做两种洗手法——阿母尼亚洗手法和自己一向所认为最好的费尔布林格尔氏洗手法——的细菌培养比较。就在走出学习阿母尼亚洗手法的第一步时，大连铁路医院手术室的医务工作人员立即被有关阿母尼亚洗手法的苏联文献吸引住了。苏联医学文献上写着：一九二六年苏联的医学博士斯巴索库柯赤基研究成功阿母尼亚洗手法，从一九二七年到一九三○年，他共用阿母尼亚洗手法作了三千八百次大小手术，无一化脓。这样的成绩，大连铁路医院手术室的医务工作人员还是第一次看到。这种有力的科学事实，鼓舞着他们作进一步的实践，而进一步的实践又给了他们更大的教育和鼓舞。大连铁路医院的医务工作人员先用阿母尼亚洗手法做了几次小手术，结果患者的伤口没有化脓，又做了几次大手术，也没化脓。有一个大夫用阿母尼亚洗手法做了一个已经化脓的阑尾炎手术，出乎意料之外，伤口也没化脓。成绩越大，手术室的医务工作人员的工作信心越大。起初，他们还不敢完全扔掉费尔布林格尔氏洗手法，后来，他们毅然地扔掉了费尔布林格尔氏洗手法，完全采用阿母尼亚洗手法了。由于阿母尼亚洗手法消毒较彻底，除了骨部、头部等手术外，一般手术他们都不戴胶皮手套了。
    学习苏联同志先进的医疗思想作风
    大连铁路医院手术室的医务工作人员深深地感觉到，他们所以能迅速地接受了苏联先进的医疗技术和建立了严格的科学的管理制度，乃是他们深受苏联医务工作者处处替病人打算的思想作风影响的结果。就拿手术室的卫生管理制度来说吧，大连铁路医院手术室过去习惯于一个星期大清扫一两次，但前任苏联院长车尔尼舍娃却要求他们天天清扫，保持一尘不染。车尔尼舍娃经常在下班后到手术室来检查卫生情况。她用一块洁白的纱布各处都仔细抹一遍，如果抹到灰尘，她就把纱布留在桌上，并留下一张纸条，上面写着：同志：手术室里还有灰尘，这能给病人动手术吗？能使病人不受污染吗？能保证病人健康地出院吗？如果在各处抹不到一点灰来，她也把纱布留下，也留下一张纸条，以勉励工作人员。车尔尼舍娃的这种负责的精神，细致的工作作风，深深地感动了大连铁路医院手术室的工作人员。于是，他们建立了一个卫生小组，规定每天至少彻底清扫两次。几年来，这个卫生制度一直坚持着，使手术室的任何地方无论何时都是一尘不染。
    大连铁路医院手术室的护士长迟心兰告诉我这样一件动人的事情：有一次，曾和她在一起工作并已回国的苏联外科大夫利巴托娃，又来到大连了。利巴托娃下火车后，没有先回住在金县的自己的家，却挂念着工作，先到了医院。院长告诉她，她的爱人病了。她非常惦念。但当她听说有一个患溃疡的病人（大连铁路房产段工人石有源）正处在危险状态并在动手术时，她就急忙跑到手术室去协助其他外科大夫动手术。在施行手术的过程中，当病人需要输血的时候，利巴托娃大夫马上把自己的血输给病人三百公撮；从午前十一点多钟她一直紧张地工作到午后三点多钟，在病人脱离了危险、手术做完之后，她才感觉到自己已经很疲倦，很饿，因为她从早晨下火车后到现在还没有吃过一点东西。迟心兰说：“利巴托娃大夫的这种舍己为人的精神，确实值得我们学习。过去，我们和苏联医务工作者在一起工作，他们给我们的教育实在不小。”的确，苏联医务工作者给中国的医务工作者树立了舍己为人、救死扶伤的革命人道主义的光辉榜样，在这种榜样的影响下，中国医务工作者也表现了良好的工作精神。去年六月是手术室最忙的一个月，除去白天做的手术外，这一个月的临时手术就有二十六次。临时手术多半是在夜间。因为人少（手术室只有一个护士长，三个护士，一个卫生员，六个大夫，而这六个大夫还要兼顾门诊），手术室的医务工作人员即令作了夜班，白天也仍旧坚持工作。在那个月里，手术室的人员几乎是日以继夜地工作着。手术室护士长说：“我们应该学习苏联同志的榜样，当病人需要我们的时候，我们能尽到责任，这就是我们的最大愉快了。”
