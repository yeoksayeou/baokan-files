Cultural Briefs

Good Results in Compilation Work by the Translation Committee of the Tibet Military Region

The Translation Committee under the Tibet Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army has achieved good results in compilation work over the past year. Since its establishment in early 1952, the Translation Committee has compiled and translated approximately 250 documents in both Tibetan and Chinese languages. It has also compiled many historical documents related to Tibet, such as historical materials on the close relationship between Han and Tibetan peoples, and concise histories of successive Dalai Lamas and Panchen Lamas. In addition, the Translation Committee is responsible for translating "Tibetan News Briefs" and has compiled many new Tibetan textbooks and teaching materials for the cadre school of the Tibet Military Region and Lhasa Primary School.

The personnel participating in the translation work are highly enthusiastic. Some older people, like the young people, insist on working eight hours a day, and often work late into the night to translate "Tibetan News Briefs." Amidst their busy work, they still set aside one hour each day to study the Agreement on Measures for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet and other ethnic policies, and regularly hold current affairs seminars and translation business research meetings.

The staff of the Translation Committee includes cadres of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, famous Tibetan scholars, Living Buddhas, Lamas, and language workers from the mainland to Tibet.

Southwest Military Region Troops' Cultural Learning Examination Concludes

The cultural learning examination for the troops of the Southwest Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army concluded at the end of May. Judging from the portion of the papers that have already been graded, the students have achieved very good results in their cultural learning over the past year. The overall average score of the students in the direct units of the Sichuan Military Region was 82.8 points for language and 94.4 points for natural sciences. The overall average score for algebra of the students in the junior high class one of the Sichuan Military Region Direct Cadre Remedial School was 99.4 points. 62 percent of the students in the junior high class of the Xikang Military Region Cadre Remedial School will receive certificates of merit.

Currently, all teaching units are paying close attention to the review work after the examination, and are conducting remedial instruction targeting the weak areas in cultural learning discovered in the examination.

The "People's Warrior" newspaper of the Political Department of the Southwest Military Region published an editorial on June 1, calling on leaders at all levels to consolidate the existing achievements in cultural education, persist in cultural education work, and make it a long-term and regular task.

Fujian Military Region Troops Achieve Great Success in Cultural Education

The cultural education work of the various organs and troops under the Fujian Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army has achieved great success. Many cadres and soldiers of worker and peasant origin have initially laid the foundation for learning and mastering modern military science after a year of cultural study.

In the past year, in order to ensure the smooth progress of cultural learning, the Fujian Military Region has transferred and trained a large number of cadres and educated youth to participate in cultural education and teaching work, established many cultural remedial schools and literacy classes, and printed and distributed a large number of textbooks and popular reading materials.

During the learning process, many cadres and soldiers with higher cultural levels promoted the spirit of mutual assistance and fraternity to help those with lower cultural levels to learn. The troops stationed on the coast and islands persisted in cultural learning while performing guard duties and devised various methods to overcome the difficulties of insufficient teaching equipment and classrooms. Some used the shade of large trees as classrooms, and when it rained, they taught and learned while holding umbrellas and covering themselves with oilcloths; some wrote new characters on paper and posted them on the entrances of fortifications, wrote them on the roadside during relocation, or compiled them into clapper rhymes and "doggerel" for review; some used tarpaulins instead of blackboards.

During cultural learning in the Fujian Military Region, literary soldiers in the style of Gao Yubao, such as Zhang Xiukun and Wang Liyan, also emerged. They have all written autobiographical literary works of 30,000 to 40,000 words or more than 100,000 words. These works were exhibited at the recent Fujian Military Region Cultural Education Exhibition and were unanimously praised by the audience.

Shanghai's First People's Sports Meet Closes

Shanghai's First People's Sports Meet closed on the 7th. After four days of competition, many excellent results were achieved in more than 60 competitions and performances. Liu Zenggui, an athlete in the men's 3,000-meter long-distance race (with a time of 9 minutes and 49.4 seconds), set a new national record. Very good results were also achieved in the women's high jump and women's 100-meter race. In the motorcycle performance, the Shanghai Public Security Forces demonstrated concealment driving, leaping over trenches, passing through fire arrays, and techniques such as changing tires in mid-air on the sidecar, which were all very impressive. At this meeting, Gu Yong, 71, and Wang Guishan, 70, participated in the men's 5,000-meter race walking performance.

Xu Jianguo, Deputy Mayor of Shanghai Municipal People's Government, praised the athletes' excellent achievements and the new sportsmanship of unity, friendship, and mutual learning in his speech at the closing ceremony; and encouraged the athletes to regularize sports activities and strive to improve their technical level in sports more quickly and promote the health of the people.
