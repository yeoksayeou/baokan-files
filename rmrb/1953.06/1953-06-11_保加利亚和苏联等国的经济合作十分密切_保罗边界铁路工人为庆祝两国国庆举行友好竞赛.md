Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, 8th dispatch: Bulgaria and the Soviet Union and other People's Democratic countries have very close economic cooperation. Almost every day ships or trains transport goods from the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries to Bulgaria. Ships loaded with materials and machines for Bulgaria's construction sail to the Black Sea ports of Stalin and Burgas, and to the Danube ports of Lom and Ruse. For example, on May 17th, the Bulgarian ships "Kollektivist" and "September" arrived at the port of Stalin from the Soviet Union carrying equipment for shipyards and other construction. The Romanian ship "Constanta" arrived from the Soviet Union with cotton. Czechoslovakian cranes, "Skoda" trucks, compressors and steel rails were transported to the port of Lom. A large batch of Hungarian steel also arrived in Bulgaria. In addition, several trains transported Soviet agricultural machinery, lubricating oil and fuel to the Tolbukhin station.
Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, 8th dispatch from the Bulgarian Telegraph Agency: Railway workers at the Ruse (Bulgarian) and Giurgiu (Romanian) stations near the Bulgarian-Romanian border recently signed a competition contract in Ruse to commemorate the national days of the two countries (September 9th for Bulgaria and August 23rd for Romania). According to the contract, the content of the mutual competition between the workers of both sides includes: rapid transportation of goods according to the timetable; ensuring that the time is observed and shortened when the ferry crosses the Danube River on the border between the two countries and that the ferry's role is fully utilized; timely exchange of vehicles; and minimizing damage. The results of the competition will be evaluated and announced by the Ruse-Giurgiu Special Committee.

    【新华社八日讯】据保加利亚通讯社索非亚讯，保加利亚和罗马尼亚两国边界附近的鲁西车站（保）和基尔朱车站（罗）的铁路工人，为了纪念两国的国庆日（保加利亚为九月九日，罗马尼亚为八月二十三日），最近在鲁西签订了竞赛合同。根据合同，双方工人互相竞赛的内容包括：按照时间表迅速运输货物；保证在渡船横渡两国边界多瑙河时，遵守和缩短时间并充分发挥渡船的作用；及时地换车；尽量减少损毁。竞赛结果将由鲁西—基尔朱特别委员会评定宣布。
