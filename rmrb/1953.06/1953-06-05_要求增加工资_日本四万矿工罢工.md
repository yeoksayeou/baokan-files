    Demanding Wage Increase
    40,000 Japanese Miners Strike
    [Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 4th] Approximately 40,000 Japanese mining workers began a ten-day strike on the 3rd to demand wage increases. The strike is mainly composed of workers from the "Nihon Mining," "Mitsubishi Mining," "Sumitomo Metal Mining," and "Furukawa Mining" – the four major companies belonging to the All-Japan Metal Mine Workers' Union Federation. They are demanding a 40% increase in wages from the current low level. Due to the miners' strike, copper production alone has decreased by 400 tons per day, worth 136 million yen.
    Other mining workers are also planning strikes. Meanwhile, according to union officials, if the issue of wage increases remains unresolved by the end of this strike period, the workers will hold a second ten-day strike starting on June 13th.
