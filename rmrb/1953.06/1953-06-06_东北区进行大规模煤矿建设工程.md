Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 5th: A large-scale coal mine construction project is actively underway in the coal-rich Northeast region of our country. In the coal mining areas of Liaodong, Liaoxi, Songjiang, and Jilin provinces, eight vertical shafts, twenty-one inclined shafts, and two open-pit mines are under construction. The shaft construction of the Xi'an vertical shaft and the Hegang Dongshan vertical shaft has been completed, and the underground station and tunnel excavation are now underway. The shaft construction of the remaining six vertical shafts will also be completed before July of this year. These vertical shafts are expected to produce coal successively in the next two years. In the two open-pit mines being built in Fuxin, some overburden removal work has been completed, and railway and tram tracks are being built, and high-voltage power lines are being erected. They will be put into production in July this year. The twenty-one new and renovated inclined shafts distributed throughout the Northeast will also be completed by the end of this year. After completion, the production capacity of the Northeast's inclined shafts will increase by 15% to 20% compared to the existing capacity.
    Currently, on various construction sites, workers are skillfully operating rock drills, rock grabs, pneumatic picks, electric shovels, electric locomotives, and other machines and tools that replace manual labor, completing their daily workload with outstanding labor efficiency. For example, the workers constructing the Hegang Xing'an Tai vertical shaft are using rock grabs to load and transport rocks, increasing efficiency by more than four times compared to manual loading. The Zhu Wei team at the Fuxin Haizhou open-pit mine completed the entire month's overburden removal task in nineteen working days in April. Many management cadres have received assistance from Soviet experts and are now able to skillfully manage very complex open-pit mines, vertical shafts, and other projects. They have learned advanced management methods such as the Soviet parallel flow operation method and fixed-point operation, which has greatly accelerated the progress of the project.
    The equipment for these vertical shafts, inclined shafts, and open-pit mines will all be modern. In terms of coal mining and transportation, coal mining combines, coal cutters, electric shovels, electric locomotives, etc., will be used. After the completion of these construction projects, the output will be very large. The output of the eight vertical shafts alone will be equivalent to the total output of all the inclined shafts in the Northeast. The coal produced can fully supply the needs of rapidly developing industrial production such as steelmaking, ironmaking, power generation, railways, shipping, and people's daily lives in the future. In terms of safety and welfare facilities, these newly built mines and open-pit mines are also very complete. Advanced Soviet technology facilities will be used for ventilation, methane drainage, and prevention of roof collapses. Each mine will be equipped with sunlamp rooms, hot water showers, locker rooms, clinics, and clubs, etc.

### 东北区进行大规模煤矿建设工程

    东北区进行大规模煤矿建设工程
    【新华社沈阳五日电】在我国煤藏丰厚的东北地区，规模宏大的煤矿建设工程正在积极进行。辽东、辽西、松江、吉林等省的煤矿区，有八座竖井、二十一个斜井和两个露天矿正在建设中。西安竖井和鹤岗东山竖井的井筒工程已经完工，目前已开始井下车场和巷道的开凿工程。其余六座竖井的井筒工程也将在今年七月以前建设完成。这些竖井预计在以后的两年当中就可以陆续出煤。在阜新建设的两个露天矿，部分剥土工程已完工，目前正在修筑火车、电车路轨，架设高压电线，今年七月就可开始投入生产。分布在东北各地的新建和改建的二十一个斜井，今年年底也要全部完成。完成后，东北斜井的生产能力将比现有的增加百分之十五到二十。
    现在，在各个工地上，工人们正在熟练地操纵着凿岩机、抓岩机、风镐、电铲、电机车等代替体力劳动的机械和工具，以突出的劳动效率完成着每天的工作量。如建设鹤岗兴安台竖井的工人，使用抓岩机装运岩石比用人工装运提高效率四倍以上；阜新海州露天矿朱伟小组四月份以十九个工作日完成了全月的剥岩任务。很多管理干部得到了苏联专家的帮助，已经能够熟练地管理非常复杂的露天矿、竖井等工程。他们学习了苏联的平行流水作业法、定点作业等先进的管理方法，大大地加速了工程的进度。
    这些竖井、斜井、露天矿的设备都将是现代化的。在采煤和运输方面，将使用采煤联合机、截煤机、电铲、电机车等。这些建设工程完成以后，产量都很大，只八座竖井的产量就要相等于现在东北全部斜井的产量总和。所产的煤可以充分供应将来迅速发展的工业生产如炼钢、炼铁、发电和铁路、航运以及人民日常生活的需要。在安全福利设施方面，这些新建的矿井和露天矿也十分完善，通风、排除瓦斯、防止冒顶等都将采用苏联先进的技术设施，每个矿井都将设有太阳灯室、热水淋浴室、更衣室、医务所和俱乐部等。
