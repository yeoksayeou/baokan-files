One Year of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway

Yang Zhongyi

Formation of a New Transportation System

The Chengdu-Chongqing Railway was fully opened to traffic on July 1, 1952, and this year's "July 1st" marks its first anniversary.

After the full opening of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, the transportation landscape within Sichuan Province underwent fundamental changes. The transportation on the Chengdu-Chongqing Highway, which runs parallel to the railway, has gradually been replaced by the railway. A large number of transportation vehicles have been transferred to the Sichuan-Shaanxi Highway, Sichuan-Yunnan Highway, and Sichuan-Guizhou Highway. Boats in the Tuo River basin have also been reassigned to rivers in remote areas, increasing the number of transportation vehicles in areas lacking automobile and boat transport.

As the number of transportation vehicles increased, new highways were also built. The people of Dazu County built a 34-kilometer highway from Dazu County to Youtingpu Station on the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway in two months, enabling a steady stream of grain to be exported from Dazu County. Bishan County also built a highway to Dechengba Station in Jiangjin, allowing Bishan's local products, coal, pig iron, and handicrafts to flow to the railway. Therefore, the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway became the hub of water and land transportation in Sichuan, linking many highways and rivers to form a new transportation network.

Strengthening the Relationship Between Urban and Rural Areas

More importantly, the opening of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway greatly improved the economic relationship between urban and rural areas, enlivened the exchange of goods, began to narrow the gap between industrial and agricultural products, and played a significant role in further consolidating the worker-peasant alliance. In the past, due to a lack of transportation and high transportation costs, it was difficult to sell agricultural and local products from rural areas, and various industrial products were also difficult to transport to rural areas. The gap between industrial and agricultural products was large, which seriously hampered the development of the rural economy and the prosperity of urban industry and commerce. Now, this situation has begun to change. For example, Yongchuan, Dazu, Rongchang, and other counties are rich rice-producing areas. Before the opening of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, each county had one-third of its surplus grain that could not be transported out each year, and the price of agricultural products was particularly low. In May 1951, farmers in Rongchang County had to use 358 catties of rice to exchange for a small package of Double Happiness brand cotton yarn. After the opening of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway on July 1, 1952, only 250 catties of rice were needed to exchange for a small package of Double Happiness brand cotton yarn. In the past, rural by-products such as eggs were sold for about 2,200 yuan per ten, but after the opening of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, the price increased to 3,300 yuan. On the other hand, in the past, coal from Weiyuan, more than 100 kilometers away from Chengdu, never entered the Chengdu market due to transportation blockages. The more than 700,000 people in Chengdu used wood as fuel, and a family's firewood expenses even exceeded their rice expenses. After the opening of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, coal from Weiyuan, Longchang, and along the Chengdu-Chongqing line began to be delivered to Chengdu in large quantities, and the price of coal in Chengdu dropped by 30%. General families switched to using coal as fuel. The joint state-private Chengdu Qiming Electric Light Company greatly reduced its production costs by using coal as fuel, and the company's electricity prices were also reduced, which was extremely beneficial to reducing industrial costs and improving the economic lives of urban residents.

Brought Prosperity to Industry and Commerce

The opening of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway opened up sales channels for Sichuan's local specialties and brought prosperity to industry and commerce. There are more than 300 kinds of medicinal materials in the western Sichuan plain and northern minority areas, but in the past, due to high transportation costs, they could not be sold smoothly. Among them, such as phellodendron and cassia, the selling price in Chengdu was 70,000 yuan per 100 catties. With freight, it would cost 170,000 yuan in Chongqing, but the market price in Chongqing was only 140,000 yuan per 100 catties, so no one traded them. Maoxian Prefecture is rich in Aucklandia and Notopterygium, which must be transported to Hankou for sale via the Sichuan-Shaanxi Highway, but sales were sluggish due to high transportation costs. After the opening of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, freight per ton was reduced from 1.52 million yuan to 314,300 yuan, making medicinal materials go from sluggish to bestsellers. Hemp, produced in western Sichuan, is a major raw material for industry, but in the past, it gradually lost its market due to excessive freight. After the opening of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, the Chengdu Station alone transported 1,000 tons of hemp in mid-September 1952. In addition, tobacco leaves, vegetable oil, oil cakes, scented tea, and pig bristles were all transported to Chengdu by frequent automobiles and rubber-wheeled carts, and then shipped to Chongqing. Under these circumstances, cities such as Chengdu and Chongqing have become distribution centers for goods, and industry and commerce are unprecedentedly prosperous. In 1952, the turnover of the transportation industry in Chengdu exceeded the peak sales season of 1951 by 25% to 30%.

Neijiang City on the Chengdu-Chongqing line is known as the "Sugar Capital," with an annual output of more than 500 million catties of sugar cane. In the past, due to inconvenient transportation, sugar was difficult to sell. After the opening of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, the sugarcane produced in various places along the line was transported to factories, and the freight was reduced by more than 80% compared with previous years. At the same time, the price of coal was also greatly reduced, which reduced the processing cost of sugar production by 11%. Trains transported sugar from sugar factories to Chongqing and Chengdu, and then to all parts of the country, and the freight rate was also reduced by 14% compared with before. Coupled with the support of department stores, the production enthusiasm of sugarcane farmers and manufacturers has been greatly improved.

Salt from Zigong used to be transported by water along the Tuo River, which took a lot of time and had limited capacity. Since April 1 this year, the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway and the Qijiang Railway have organized joint transportation, and signed a joint salt transportation contract with the Southwest Salt Affairs Administration. In this way, the salt transported from Zigong can be received at the Ganshui Station on the Qijiang line after paying a freight of 198,710 yuan per ton to the Neijiang Station. The freight per load is 1,516 yuan less than water transportation, and it only takes 45 hours to reach Ganshui Station, saving more than 20 days of transportation time. The sales of salt in Zigong have also been greatly opened up.

Before the opening of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, the Yida Coal Mine in Youyanqiao, Longchang County, had a daily output of only 60 tons and its business was sluggish. After the opening of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, a large amount of coal from the mine was transported to factories in Chengdu and Chongqing. The daily output after September 1952 reached more than 300 tons, and the Yida Coal Mine has embarked on a prosperous road.

Paved the Way for Industrialization

The Chengdu-Chongqing Railway is a new railway that the people of Southwest China have longed for for more than 40 years. In the past year, with the enthusiastic support and care of the people of Southwest China, it has strengthened the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas and deepened the relationship of mutual assistance between urban and rural areas. Now, with the advent of large-scale national economic construction, the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway is transporting large quantities of building materials and industrial equipment day and night to support the various newly built enterprises and the Tiancheng Railway, which is watched by the people of the whole country. The Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, which is watched by tens of millions of people across the country, has today created favorable conditions for economic construction in the Southwest.

    成渝铁路通车一年
    杨忠义
    新交通系统的形成
    成渝铁路于一九五二年七月一日全线通车，到今年“七一”就整整一年了。
    成渝铁路全线通车后，四川省境内的交通运输面貌起了根本的变化。与成渝铁路平行的成渝公路的运输，已逐渐由铁路代替，大批的交通运输工具已转调到川陕公路、川滇公路、川黔公路上去；沱江流域的船只也都调配到边远地区的河流里去，使缺乏汽车和船只运输的地区的交通工具增多了。
    由于交通工具增多，新的公路也跟着修筑起来。大足县的人民在两个月内，筑成了一条从大足县到成渝铁路线上邮亭铺车站的三十四公里的公路，使大足县的粮食得以源源输出。璧山县也修通了一条到江津德成坝车站的公路，使璧山的土产、煤、生铁和手工业品也能流到铁路上来了。因此，成渝铁路成了四川境内水陆运输的枢纽，它把许多条公路、河流联结起来，组成了新的运输网。
      密切了城乡关系
    成渝铁路的通车，更重要的是大大地改善了城乡经济关系，活跃了城乡物资的交流，开始缩小了工业品与农产品的差额，对进一步巩固工农联盟起了重大的作用。过去由于交通工具缺乏，运输成本高昂，农村的农产品和土产品很难外销，而各种工业品也很难运销到农村，工农业产品的差额很大，因而严重地桎梏了农村经济的发展和城市工商业的繁荣，现在，这个情况开始有了改变。例如永川、大足、荣昌等县，都是富足的产米地区，在成渝铁路通车以前，各县每年都有三分之一的余粮无法运出，农产品价格特别低。荣昌县的农民在一九五一年五月间，要用三百五十八斤大米才能换到一小包双喜牌棉纱。一九五二年七月一日成渝铁路通车以后，只要用二百五十斤大米就可以换到一小包双喜牌棉纱了。过去农村的副产品如鸡蛋，每十个售价约二千二百元，成渝铁路通车后，提高到三千三百元。而另一方面，过去距离成都一百多公里的威远的煤，因为交通阻塞，从来没有进入过成都市场，成都七十多万人口都用木材作燃料，一个家庭的木柴费用甚至超过食米费用。成渝路通车以后，威远、隆昌和成渝路沿线的煤开始大量送到成都，成都煤价降低了百分之三十，一般的家庭都改用煤作燃料了。公私合营的成都启明电灯公司由于采用了煤作燃料，生产成本大大减低，该公司的电价也因此降低了，这对减低工业成本和改善城市人民经济生活是极为有利的。
       带来了工商业的繁荣
    成渝铁路的通车，给四川的土特产开辟了销路，给工商业带来了繁荣。四川西部平原和北部少数民族地区有三百多种药材，过去由于运输成本过高，不能畅销。其中如黄柏、官桂等，成都售价是七万元一百斤，加上运费，在重庆就需十七万元，但重庆市价每百斤仅十四万元，因此无人贩运；茂县专区盛产木香、羗活，须经川陕公路转运到汉口出售，但由于运输成本高，因而滞销。成渝铁路通车以后，每吨运费从一百五十二万元减低到三十一万四千三百元，使药材由滞销变为畅销。川西出产的大麻是工业上的主要原料，过去由于运费过高，逐渐丧失了市场。成渝铁路通车后，仅成都车站在一九五二年九月中旬就运出大麻达一千吨。另外如烟叶、植物油、油饼、花茶、猪鬃等，都随着来往频繁的汽车、胶轮车载运到成都，再纷纷东运到重庆了。在这种情况下，成都、重庆等城市已成了货物的集散地，工商业空前的繁荣。一九五二年成都运输业的营业额，超过一九五一年旺销季节的百分之二十五到三十。
    在成渝路线上的内江城，号称“糖都”，年产甘蔗约在五亿斤以上。过去由于交通不便，蔗糖难销。成渝铁路通车后，将沿线各地出产的甘蔗运到工厂，运费比往年减低了百分之八十以上，同时煤价也大大降低，使制糖的加工费降低了百分之十一。火车从糖厂把糖运到重庆、成都，再转运到全国各地，运价也较前降低了百分之十四。加上百货公司的扶持，便大大地提高了蔗农和制造商的生产积极性。
    自流井的盐，过去都经水路沿沱江运出，时间花的多，运量还有限。今年四月一日起，成渝铁路和綦江铁路组织了联运，并与西南区盐务管理局签订了食盐联运的合同。这样从自流井运出的盐，至内江车站每吨交纳十九万八千七百一十元的运费后，就可以在綦江线的赶水站收货。运费每担较水运要减少一千五百一十六元，而且只要四十五小时就可到达赶水站，节省运输时间二十余天。自流井的盐的销路也因此大大打开了。
    隆昌县右燕桥的义大煤矿，在成渝铁路未通车以前，每日产量仅六十吨，营业萧条。成渝铁路通车以后，该矿的煤大量地运到成都、重庆各工厂去，一九五二年九月以后的日产量达三百余吨，义大煤矿已走上了欣欣向荣的道路了。
       为工业化铺平了道路
    成渝铁路是西南人民渴望了四十多年的一条新兴铁路。一年来，它在西南人民的热烈支持和爱护下，加强了城乡物资交流，密切了城乡互助的关系。现在，随着国家大规模经济建设的到来，成渝铁路正日日夜夜地运输大批的建筑材料、工业器材支援着各个新建的企业以及全国人民注视的天成铁路。全国人民千万只眼睛注视着的成渝铁路，今天，它已经为西南的经济建设创造了有利的条件。
