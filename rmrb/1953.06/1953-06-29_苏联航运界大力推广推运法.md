Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 20th—The Soviet shipping industry is vigorously promoting a new shipping method. This method is a new creation in Soviet inland river shipping. Adopting this method means placing the barge in front of the steamship and using the steamship to push the barge forward. Usually, steamships sail in front of barges, towing them with a long rope; when the barge is one hundred and fifty or two hundred meters or more behind the steamship, the barge cannot use the flowing force of the downstream water, and the large currents of water stirred up by the steamship's propeller hit the following barge, further hindering the barge's progress. The push-towing method eliminates these shortcomings. The steamship travels behind the barge, with its bow against the stern of the barge, and a few devices are added between the two ships, so that they travel like one ship. When using this method downstream, the minimum resistance of the water flow can be overcome. This method connects the bows and sterns of the ships, making it easier to command the barge and strengthen the organizational work on board. Advanced workers who bravely adopted this method in this Five-Year Plan have proven that, under the same conditions, the new method is much more efficient than the old one: the speed is about 20 to 25 percent faster, and the transportation cost is also greatly reduced.
    Soviet river transport workers are also constantly improving the push-towing method in practice. On June 17, the steamship "Dore Shi" sailing from Zaporozhye to Kiev, used the push-towing method to push six barges loaded with ore for the first time on the Dnieper River. The total carrying capacity of these barges was 3,600 tons; before this, steamships could only push one or two ships. Steamships using the push-towing method on the Dnieper River can save 100,000 rubles per voyage.

    苏联航运界大力推广推运法
    【新华社莫斯科二十日电】苏联航运界正在大力推广新的航运法。这种方法是苏联内河航运方面的新创造。采用这种方法就是把驳船放在汽船前面，用汽船来推动驳船前进。平常汽船都是驶在驳船前头，用一条长索来拖驳船的；当驳船落在汽船后面一百五十或二百公尺或更远的距离时，驳船就不能使用顺流的水的流力，而且汽船螺旋桨所掀起的大股水流，打在随后的驳船上，更阻碍驳船的前进。推进的方法就免除了这些缺点。汽船走在驳船后面，把船头顶住驳船的船尾，两船之间稍微加上一些装置，行驶时就像一条船一样。在顺流时使用这种方法，可以克服水流的最小阻力。这种方法使前后船首尾衔接，因此也便于指挥驳船，加强船上的组织工作。在这次五年计划中勇敢地采用这个方法的先进工作者证明，在同样条件下，新法比旧法效率高得多：速度约快百分之二十至二十五，运输成本也减低很多。
    苏联河运工作者还不断在实践中改善推运法。六月十七日，从萨坡罗什驶到基辅的汽船“多列士”号，使用推运法，第一次在第聂伯河上推了六只载着矿石的驳船，这些驳船全部载重量为三千六百吨；而在这以前，汽船只能推一两只船，在第聂伯河上采用推运法的汽船，每行驶一次就可以节约十万卢布。
