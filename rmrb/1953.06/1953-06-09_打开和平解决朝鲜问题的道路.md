The agreement on the repatriation of prisoners of war in the Korean armistice negotiations, which the people of the world have been longing for, was signed at Panmunjom on June 8. This brings the Korean armistice closer to realization, thus opening the path to a peaceful resolution of the Korean question. Therefore, the signing of this agreement is undoubtedly the most important event in the current international situation.

During the eighteen months that began on December 11, 1951, when the discussion on the issue of prisoner of war repatriation began, the Korean and Chinese side made many major efforts, especially the fact that the Korean armistice negotiations were resumed at our initiative and the discussion on the issue of prisoner of war repatriation progressed rapidly. This demonstrates our sincere desire to seek a solution to the issue of prisoner of war repatriation in order to achieve a Korean armistice. On March 30 and 31 of this year, Zhou Enlai, Premier of the State Council and Minister of Foreign Affairs of China, and Marshal Kim Il-sung, Premier of the Cabinet of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, successively issued statements announcing the jointly consistent proposal of the Chinese and Korean governments on resolving the issue of all prisoners of war, namely: "Both negotiating parties should guarantee the immediate repatriation of all prisoners of war in their custody who insist on repatriation after the armistice, and transfer the remaining prisoners of war to neutral countries to ensure a fair resolution of their repatriation issues." This proposal was immediately enthusiastically supported by Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov. When the delegations of both sides officially resumed discussions on the issue of prisoner of war repatriation on April 26, our side immediately put forward a six-point plan to implement the above proposal, in order to seek a rapid and fair resolution of the issue of prisoner of war repatriation. At that time, because the U.S. side expressed disagreement with the point that prisoners of war not directly repatriated after the armistice should be sent to neutral countries, insisting that these prisoners of war should not be transported out of Korea to be handed over to neutral countries, but should be guarded by neutral countries in Korea; our side then proposed a second concrete plan including eight proposals on May 7, proposing that prisoners of war not directly repatriated after the armistice be handed over to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission to take over and handle them within the territory of Korea. Subsequently, although the U.S. side admitted that our plan could be the basis for a glorious agreement, the U.S. side put forward a "counter-proposal" on May 13, which violated the negotiating basis on the issue of prisoner of war repatriation that both sides had previously agreed upon, so that our side could not accept it; and the U.S. side's "counter-proposal" immediately aroused dissatisfaction from peace-loving people around the world and the governments of many countries. Due to the pressure of the world's people and the firm efforts of the Korean and Chinese side, the U.S. side requested the armistice negotiations to enter administrative meetings. After several consultations, the agreement on the repatriation of prisoners of war between the two sides, which is now announced, was finally reached.

This agreement is in line with the negotiating basis of our original proposal. Its spirit is to divide the repatriation of all prisoners of war into two steps. The first step is that within two months after the armistice agreement comes into effect, both sides should directly repatriate all prisoners of war in their custody who insist on repatriation in batches, in accordance with the relevant provisions of Article 3 of the draft armistice agreement, and hand them over to the side to which they belonged when they were captured, and the detaining side shall not hinder them in any way. The second step is to release the remaining prisoners of war who have not been directly repatriated from the military control and custody of the detaining side within sixty days after the effective date of the armistice agreement, and hand them all over to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, with India as the chairman and executor, agreed by both sides, for custody and supervision in Korea; then, the country to which the prisoners of war belong shall send representatives to explain to the prisoners of war within ninety days from the date when the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission takes over, eliminate any doubts they may have, and notify them of matters related to their return home. Once a prisoner of war applies to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission to be repatriated home, the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission or one of its affiliated institutions shall make it effective by a majority vote. If the prisoners of war have not exercised their right to be repatriated after the ninety-day period of custody by the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission expires, they shall be handed over to the political conference proposed in Article 60 of the draft armistice agreement to find a solution within thirty days. During this period, the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission shall continue to maintain custody of these prisoners of war. Any prisoner of war who has not exercised his right to be repatriated within one hundred and twenty days after the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission is responsible for their custody, and if no other solution has been agreed upon by the political conference for them, the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission shall declare that their status as prisoners of war is lifted, making them civilians; then, according to their applications, those who choose to go to neutral countries shall be assisted by the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and the Indian Red Cross. This agreement stipulates on the one hand that the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission should have full powers, and the detaining party shall not give any hindrance, interference or sabotage; on the other hand, it stipulates that the side to which the prisoners of war belong shall explain and visit the prisoners of war. Therefore, it makes it possible for all prisoners of war to have the opportunity to exercise their right to be repatriated.

From the entire content of this agreement, people can more clearly understand that the so-called "no forced repatriation" argument that the U.S. side has consistently promoted on the issue of prisoner of war repatriation in the past is actually completely non-existent. Regarding this argument of the U.S. side, our side has repeatedly pointed out that it is not only inconsistent with the facts, but also completely unfounded in law. Because prisoners of war are detained by the detaining party by force and controlled by the detaining party's force. Due to this fact, there is obviously only the issue of separating prisoners of war from the detaining party's force control, and there is no possibility of any "forced repatriation" at all. Now, according to the agreement already reached between the two sides, the prisoners of war who have not been directly repatriated after the armistice are fundamentally handed over by the detaining party to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, with India as the chairman, to be guarded at a location designated by the detaining party within the territory of Korea; as for the contact between the side to which the prisoners of war belong and the prisoners of war, there are only seven representatives who explain to every one thousand prisoners of war under the arrangement of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission. This further shows that the so-called "forced repatriation" has no possible hypothetical basis. And what should be resolutely prevented on the issue of prisoner of war repatriation is the forced detention of prisoners of war by the detaining party. Our side has repeatedly pointed out this danger and firmly opposes the forced detention of prisoners of war. Our side's position is fully in line with the wishes and interests of prisoners of war who are eager to return home. Therefore, our side's consistent position against the forced detention of prisoners of war is completely reasonable and realistic.

In fact, this danger of forced detention of prisoners of war still needs to be paid attention to today, when an agreement on the issue of prisoner of war repatriation has been reached. The South Korean Syngman Rhee clique is clamoring against the agreement on the issue of repatriation of prisoners of war. Choi Deok-shin, the representative of the Syngman Rhee clique participating in the armistice negotiations, wrote a letter to U.S. Chief Negotiator General Harrison on May 25, after the U.S. side proposed a new proposal. This letter was publicly published at the residence of the U.S. negotiation representative in Munsan on May 29. In this letter, Choi Deok-shin openly opposed the provision that all prisoners of war who are not directly repatriated should be handed over to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, and threatened that "those prisoners who are unwilling to return to communist rule" will "rise up and riot against those Indian troops." This is obviously a clamor by the South Korean Syngman Rhee clique to forcibly detain prisoners of war by force. Therefore, people must recognize that the real key to the issue of prisoner of war repatriation still lies in whether the U.S. side can earnestly implement the provisions of the agreement and prevent the danger of forcibly detaining prisoners of war. This will be a new test that the U.S. side will encounter in the process of implementing the agreement, and it is also something that people who are eager to peacefully resolve the Korean issue should pay close attention to and be vigilant about.

Not only that, but people should also note that in the case of the Syngman Rhee clique clamoring against the prisoner of war repatriation agreement, U.S. President Eisenhower has sent a letter to Syngman Rhee, claiming that after the conclusion of the Korean armistice agreement, the United States is prepared to negotiate and conclude a so-called "mutual defense treaty" with the Syngman Rhee clique. If the United States really intends to do so, people cannot but think that this is actually a new conspiracy between the United States and the Syngman Rhee clique, which will re-obstruct the further peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. This runs counter to the purpose of the political conference to seek the peaceful reunification of Korea. According to the provisions of Article 4, Paragraph 60 of the draft Korean armistice agreement reached by both sides on August 5, 1952, the task of the higher-level political conference of both sides should be to "negotiate issues such as the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea and the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue." Our side is fully willing to further negotiate at the political conference held after the armistice to promote the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue and realize the reunification of Korea. In my statement issued by Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai on November 28, 1952, regarding the endorsement of the Soviet delegation's proposal to the 7th session of the United Nations General Assembly on the Korean issue, it was pointed out that the peaceful reunification of Korea should be realized by the Koreans themselves. Our side's position is in line with the legitimate wishes and legal rights of the Korean people. However, what is the purpose of the so-called "mutual defense treaty" between the United States and the Syngman Rhee clique? It is not difficult to understand that this new military alliance, which continues to place the Syngman Rhee clique under its military control, is either to encourage the Syngman Rhee clique to undermine the Korean armistice and peace, or to deepen the division of Korea. Can this be said to be "realizing the reunification of Korea by all peaceful means"? No wonder Syngman Rhee clamored after receiving Eisenhower's letter, "We only have one way to go, and that is to continue the struggle until we achieve victory or failure." The United States intends to openly carry out a conspiracy with the Syngman Rhee clique regarding the political conference when the Korean armistice agreement is yet to be signed and the higher-level political conference has not yet been convened. This cannot but attract the attention of the vast number of people around the world who hope to seek a peaceful solution to the Korean issue after the armistice.

Now that the issue of prisoner of war repatriation has been resolved, the Korean armistice negotiations, which have been delayed for nearly two years, can finally reach a full agreement. The agreement on the repatriation of prisoners of war has opened the path to a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. However, it remains for both sides to abide by the agreement and fulfill their obligations in the future to ensure that the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission can smoothly complete its tasks, and to fairly and reasonably resolve the handling of prisoners of war who have not exercised their right to be repatriated at the higher-level political conference, so as to further seek a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue in the spirit of sincere consultation. People all agree that the Korean issue is one of the most important international issues. Its peaceful resolution will greatly ease the current international tension and prepare the conditions for resolving other pressing international issues.

### 打开和平解决朝鲜问题的道路

    打开和平解决朝鲜问题的道路
    全世界人民所渴望的朝鲜停战谈判关于战俘遣返问题的协议，已于六月八日在板门店签订了。这就使朝鲜停战接近实现，从而打开了和平解决朝鲜问题的道路。因此，这个协议的签订，无疑地是目前国际形势中头等重要的事件。
    自一九五一年十二月十一日开始讨论关于战俘遣返问题的十八个月的期间，朝中方面曾经作了多次重大的努力，特别是这一次在我方倡议下恢复朝鲜停战谈判，并使战俘遣返问题的讨论迅速进展的事实，更表现了我方谋求解决战俘遣返问题以实现朝鲜停战的真诚愿望。今年三月三十日和三十一日，我国政务院总理兼外交部部长周恩来和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国内阁首相金日成元帅先后发表声明，宣布朝中两国政府关于解决全部战俘问题的共同一致的建议，即：“谈判双方应保证在停战后立即遣返其所收容的一切坚持遣返的战俘，而将其余的战俘转交中立国，以保证对他们的遣返问题的公正解决。”这个建议立即得到苏联外交部长莫洛托夫的热烈支持。四月二十六日双方代表团正式恢复关于战俘遣返问题的讨论时，我方立即提出了实现上述建议的六点方案，以谋求战俘遣返问题迅速而公正的解决。当时由于美方对于停战后未被直接遣返的战俘送到中立国去一点表示异议，坚持这些战俘不能运离朝鲜交给中立国，而须由中立国在朝鲜加以看管；我方遂在五月七日又提出了包括八点建议的第二个具体方案，提议将停战后未被直接遣返的战俘交由中立国遣返委员会到朝鲜境内来接管和处理。接着，美方虽然承认我方的这一方案可以作为光荣协议的基础，但是，美方在五月十三日却提出了一个“反建议”，违反了双方早已同意的关于战俘遣返问题的谈判基础，以致我方不能接受；而美方的“反建议”立即引起了全世界爱好和平的人民和不少国家的政府的不满。由于世界人民的压力和朝中方面的坚定努力，美方才要求停战谈判进入行政性的会议，经过几次协商，终于达成了现在所公布的双方关于战俘遣返问题的协议。
    这个协议是符合于我方原来建议的谈判基础的。它的精神就是将全部战俘的遣返问题分成两个步骤来进行。第一个步骤即在停战协定生效后两个月内，双方应将其收容下的一切坚持遣返的战俘，依照停战协定草案第三条的各项有关规定，分批直接遣返，交给他们被俘时所属的一方，拘留一方不得加以任何阻难。第二个步骤，即将未被直接遣返的其余战俘，在停战协定生效日期后六十天内，从拘留一方的军事控制与收容下释放出来，全部交给双方同意的以印度为主席和执行人的中立国遣返委员会在朝鲜境内予以收容看管；然后由战俘所属国家在中立国遣返委员会接管之日起的九十天内，派出代表向战俘进行解释，消除他们可能存在的疑虑，并通知他们有关他们回返家乡的事项。任何一个战俘一经向中立国遣返委员会提出遣返回家的申请，中立国遣返委员会或它的附属机构之一，便应以多数表决使之生效。战俘在移交中立国遣返委员会看管的九十天期满后，如仍未行使被遣返的权利，便应交由停战协定草案第六十款中所建议召开的政治会议在三十天内设法解决。在这期间，中立国遣返委员会应继续保持对这些战俘的看管。任何战俘凡在中立国遣返委员会负责看管他们后的一百二十天内，如果还没有行使其被遣返的权利，又未经政治会议为他们协议出任何其他处理的办法，就应由中立国遣返委员会宣布解除他们的战俘身份，使之成为平民；然后根据各人的申请，其中凡有选择前往中立国的，应由中立国遣返委员会和印度红十字会予以协助。这个协议一方面规定中立国遣返委员会应具有充分的权力，拘留方面不得给以任何阻难、干涉和破坏；另一方面又规定战俘所属一方应对战俘进行解释和访问。因此，它就有可能使全部战俘都有行使其被遣返的权利的机会。
    从这个协议的全部内容来看，人们可以更清楚地了解到，过去在战俘遣返问题上美方所一贯宣传的所谓“不得强迫遣返”的论调，在实际上是完全不存在的。对于美方的这个论调，我方早曾一再指出，它不但不合于事实，而且在法理上也是完全没有根据的。因为，战俘是拘留一方以武力扣留的并为拘留一方的武力所控制的。由于这个事实，对于战俘显然只有脱离拘留一方的武力控制的问题，而根本不可能有什么“强迫遣返”的问题。现在，根据双方已经达成的协议，在停战后未被直接遣返的战俘在未行使其被遣返的权利之前，根本就是由拘留一方交给以印度为主席的中立国遣返委员会在朝鲜境内拘留一方所指定之地点加以看管的；至于战俘所属一方与战俘的接触，只有在中立国遣返委员会安排下向每一千名战俘进行解释的七名代表。这更可看出所谓“强迫遣返”毫无任何可能的假设根据。而在战俘遣返问题上真正应该坚决防止的，倒是拘留一方对战俘的强迫扣留。我方曾一再指出过这个危险，并坚决反对强迫扣留战俘。我方的这个立场完全符合于渴望回家的战俘的愿望和利益。因此，我方反对强迫扣留战俘的一贯立场是完全合理的和实事求是的。
    事实上，这种强迫扣留战俘的危险，就在战俘遣返问题达成协议的今天，也是依然要加以注意的。南朝鲜李承晚集团正在叫嚷着反对关于遣返战俘问题的协议。李承晚集团参加停战谈判的代表崔德新在五月二十五日美方提出了新建议之后，曾给美方首席谈判代表哈利逊中将写了一封信，这封信已于五月二十九日在美方谈判代表的驻地汶山公开发表了。在这封信中，崔德新公然反对将全部不直接遣返的战俘交给中立国遣返委员会的规定，而威胁着说，“那些不愿回到共产主义统治下的俘虏”将“起来暴动对付那些印度军队”。这显然是南朝鲜李承晚集团要以武力强迫扣留战俘的叫嚣。因此，人们必须认清，战俘遣返问题的真正关键，现在依然在于美方是否能够认真执行协议的规定，防止强迫扣留战俘的危险这个问题上。这将是美方在执行协议的过程中所将遇到的一个新的考验，同时也是渴望和平解决朝鲜问题的人们应该密切注意和警惕的。
    不仅如此，人们还应该注意到在李承晚集团叫嚷着反对战俘遣返协议的情况下，美国艾森豪威尔总统又已致函李承晚，声称在朝鲜停战协定缔结后，美国准备和李承晚集团谈判订立所谓“共同防御条约”。如果美国真是打算这样做的话，人们不能不认为这实际上就是美国和李承晚集团的一种新的预谋，它将使朝鲜问题的进一步和平解决，重新受到阻挠。这与政治会议谋求实现朝鲜的和平统一的目的，是背道而驰的。根据一九五二年八月五日双方达成的朝鲜停战协定草案第四条第六十款的规定，双方高一级政治会议的任务，应该是“协商从朝鲜撤退一切外国军队及和平解决朝鲜问题等问题”。我方完全愿意在停战后举行的政治会议上，进一步协商促成朝鲜问题的和平解决，实现朝鲜的统一。一九五二年十一月二十八日，我周恩来外长发表的关于赞同苏联代表团向联合国第七届大会提出的关于朝鲜问题的建议的声明中，曾指出应由朝鲜人自己来实现朝鲜的和平统一。我方的这个主张是符合朝鲜人民的正当愿望与合法权利的。但是，美国和李承晚集团的所谓“共同防御条约”究竟是为了什么目的呢？不难了解，这种新的军事同盟，把李承晚集团继续置于自己的军事控制下，不是为了鼓励李承晚集团来破坏朝鲜的停战与和平，就是为了加深朝鲜的分裂。这能够说是“用一切和平方法实现朝鲜统一”吗？无怪乎李承晚接到艾森豪威尔的信件之后，就在叫嚣“我们只有一条路可走，那就是继续斗争直至我们获得胜利或失败时为止。”美国在朝鲜停战协定有待签订、高一级政治会议尚未召开的时候，就打算和李承晚集团公开进行对于政治会议的预谋，这不能不引起全世界希望停战后谋求朝鲜问题获得和平解决的广大人士的注意了。
    现在，战俘遣返问题已获得解决，拖延将近两年的朝鲜停战谈判终于可以达成全部协议。战俘遣返问题的协议，打开了和平解决朝鲜问题的道路。但是，今后还有待于双方遵守协议，履行其所承担的义务，以保证中立国遣返委员会能顺利地完成其任务，并在高一级政治会议上公平合理地解决未行使被遣返权利的战俘的处理问题，从而以真诚协商的精神进一步谋求朝鲜问题的和平解决。人们都一致认为：朝鲜问题是最重要的国际问题之一，它的和平解决将大大地缓和目前的国际紧张局势，并为解决其他紧迫的国际问题准备条件。
