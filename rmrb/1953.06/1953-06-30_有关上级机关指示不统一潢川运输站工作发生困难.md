Reader's Letters Summary:

    Regarding the difficulties in the work of the Huangchuan Transportation Station of the Henan United Transportation Company due to inconsistent instructions from higher authorities:
    Chang Jingzeng from the Huangchuan Central Transportation Station of the Henan United Transportation Company wrote: On April 24th, the Henan Provincial People's Government Transportation Department issued instructions to the Huangchuan Central Transportation Station of the Henan United Transportation Company, stipulating that the vehicle management fee should be reduced from 2% of the freight to 1%. Subsequently, the Transportation Department issued a supplementary instruction stating that the reduction only applied to the management fee for ox carts, and the management fee for human-powered vehicles (flatbed carts, handcarts) should still be collected at 2%. However, on April 30th, the Henan Provincial Transportation Bureau notified us that the management fees for both ox carts and human-powered vehicles should be reduced from 2% of the freight to 1%. This was inconsistent with the regulations of the Provincial Transportation Department. In addition to complying with the instructions of the Transportation Bureau, we also requested instructions from our direct superior, the Xinyang General Station. The Xinyang General Station replied that the ox cart management fee should be collected at 1%, and the human-powered vehicle fee at 2%. Therefore, we immediately notified the county stations to change the collection method. However, a few days later, the Henan Provincial Transportation Bureau sent a document criticizing us for not complying with the Bureau's regulations and demanded immediate correction. We felt difficulties in our work and again asked the stationmaster of the Xinyang General Station for instructions. This time, he said that the human-powered vehicle management fee should be collected at 1% for hauling disaster relief grain and 2% for hauling other goods, and instructed us to implement it immediately. As a result, the Huangchuan Central Transportation Station changed the management fee collection method three times in one month, which caused great dissatisfaction among the local people. It is suggested that the Henan Provincial Transportation Department investigate why the Henan Provincial Transportation Bureau and the Xinyang General Station are not communicating with each other and are acting independently, causing the lower-level organs to feel at a loss and hindering their work.

    有关上级机关指示不统一潢川运输站工作发生困难
    河南省联运公司潢川中心运输站常景曾来信：四月二十四日，河南省人民政府交通厅向河南省联运公司潢川中心运输站发出指示，规定：车辆管理费由运费的百分之二降低为百分之一。随后，交通厅又发出补充指示说：降低的只是牛车的管理费，人力车（架子车、手推车）管理费仍按百分之二征收。但是四月三十日河南省运输局却通知我们：牛车、人力车的管理费均由运费的百分之二降低到百分之一。这就与省交通厅的规定不一致。我们除了遵照运输局的指示执行外，又向直属上级信阳总站请示。信阳总站答复说：牛车管理费按百分之一征收，人力车按百分之二征收。于是，我们立即通知各县站改变征收办法。但过了几天，河南省运输局却又来文批评我们不遵照该局规定执行是错误的，叫立即纠正。我们感到工作中有困难，又向信阳总站站长请示。他这一次说：人力车管理费，拉救灾粮的按百分之一收，拉其它货物的按百分之二收；让我们立即执行。这样，潢川中心运输站在一个月内连续更动了三次管理费征收办法，当地群众很有意见。建议河南省交通厅检查一下，为什么河南省运输局和信阳总站会互不通气，各行其是，以致使下级机关感到无所适从，工作发生困难。
