Maintain Honor Forever
Ma Tieding

Recently, I discovered that Gou Peifang, the famous model Communist Party branch secretary of Shanxi Province, was originally an honorable veteran.

Gou Peifang was an outstanding political worker in the army. In 1947, he was wounded in the leg and became disabled, so he retired and returned to his hometown. At that time, his hometown, Quzhai Village in Changzhi County, was a backward village, and the Quzhai Village Party branch was a backward branch. Our comrade Gou Peifang quickly took on the educational work of the village branch and launched an irreconcilable struggle against various backward phenomena. After several years of persistence, he finally changed the original backward situation, making Quzhai Village an advanced village and the Quzhai Village branch an advanced branch. Gou Peifang's model deeds have been widely praised.

What does the above brief experience of Gou Peifang tell us? The main thing is that all veterans and transferred military personnel, no matter where they go, should and can continue to maintain and carry forward the honor of advanced soldiers, and become active and effective activists in national construction.

Originally, returning from the front lines and the army should not mean leaving the combat post and putting down the guns, nor should it mean putting down the weapons of battle. For the heroes who have been tempered in battle and military communist life, the people have ample reason to place higher hopes and greater demands on them, hoping and demanding that they be as tenacious, brave, and selfless as they were in battle, and excellently complete the new glorious tasks assigned by the Party and the state.

Now, Gou Peifang has set a living example for us, and he has satisfactorily answered the hopes and demands of the people. However, we can understand that his efforts were not easy. He had experienced a very intense inner struggle: in the army, he was a regimental-level cadre, a leader, but now he is a village cadre, and he has to carry his own luggage when he goes to the county for meetings. Isn't this lowering his "status"? However, he quickly freed himself from the harassment of this incorrect idea. He remembered Chairman Mao's words: "A Communist Party member should have the two qualities of pine and willow. The pine tree has the firm principled nature of enduring winter without withering, and the willow tree has the flexible mobility to grow and develop everywhere." Thus, he gained strength and stood up to fight again.

Here, I am reminded of the brilliant image of Vorobyov shaped in the famous Soviet novel "Happiness." Vorobyov was originally the director of the political department of a colonel, but when he returned from the front, he did not want to go to Moscow to obtain an important position, but went deep into the difficult countryside after the war to work. This was especially praised by Stalin.

Gou Peifang and Vorobyov are very similar, and that is where he is particularly touching. Our veterans and transferred military personnel (and indeed everyone) should begin to learn from him in this respect.

    保持荣誉到永久
    马铁丁
    最近我才发现：山西省著名的模范的中共党支部书记苟佩芳，原来是一个荣誉的退伍军人。
    苟佩芳在部队里就是一个很出色的政治工作人员，一九四七年，因腿上负伤成了残废而退伍回乡了。这时候，他的故乡——长治县璩寨村是个工作落后的村子，璩寨村党支部是个落后的支部。我们的苟佩芳同志很快就担负起村支部的教育工作，和各种落后现象展开了不调和的斗争。经过了几年的坚持，终于改变了原来的落后状况，使璩寨村成为先进的村子，使璩寨村支部成为先进的支部。苟佩芳的模范事迹也就被广泛地传颂着了。
    以上的苟佩芳的简略经历，告诉了我们什么呢？主要的是：所有退伍和转业的军人，不论到那里，都应该而且可能把先进战士的荣誉继续保持并发扬光大的，成为国家建设中的积极而有工作成效的活动分子。
    本来，从前线上、部队里回来，不能就是离开了战斗岗位，放下了枪，也不能就是放下了战斗的武器。对于曾经在战斗里和军事共产主义生活中锻炼过的英雄们，人民有充分理由提出更高的希望和更大的要求，希望和要求他们像在战斗中一样地顽强、英勇、奋不顾身，并卓越地完成党和国家所给予的新的光荣任务。
    现在，苟佩芳为我们做出了活的榜样来了，他圆满地回答了人民的希望和要求。可是，我们可以理解得到，他的努力是不容易的。他曾经历过很激烈的内心斗争：在部队里，他是营级干部，是首长，现在当村干部，到县里开会都得自己挑行李，这岂不是降低了自己的“身份”？但是，他很快就摆脱了这种不正确的观念的烦扰，他记起了毛主席的话：“共产党员应该具有松树和柳树的两种品质。松树有经冬不凋的坚定的原则性，柳树有到处能够生长发展的灵活机动性。”从而得到了力量，又挺身去战斗了。
    这里，我想起了苏联著名小说“幸福”里所塑造的伏罗巴耶夫的光辉形象。伏罗巴耶夫原来是上校军政治部主任，可是他从前线回来，并不想去莫斯科获取重要的职位、而是深入到战后的困难的乡村去工作。这一点，曾特别地得到斯大林的称赞。
    苟佩芳和伏罗巴耶夫是很相像的，而他之特别感动人的地方，也就在这里。我们的退伍和转业军人（以至于所有的人）都应当从这点开始向他学习。
