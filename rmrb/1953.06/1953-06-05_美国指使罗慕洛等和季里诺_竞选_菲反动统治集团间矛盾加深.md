Xinhua News Agency, Manila, June 3rd: News from Manila: The Philippine ruling clique is embroiled in endless squabbles over the "general election" in November of this year, and internal contradictions are intensifying daily.

The Philippine government party, the "Liberal Party," held a representative conference on May 24th, causing an internal split due to the presidential candidate nomination issue. The conference that day was marked by "quarrels and abuse that made the meeting exceptionally chaotic" (Associated Press). As a result, the current Philippine President Quirino was nominated as the next presidential candidate at the meeting. Former Philippine Ambassador to the United States, Romulo, who was competing with Quirino for the presidential candidacy, and his followers, including the current Philippine Vice President Lopez, withdrew from the venue midway through the day and announced on May 26th that they would form a separate "Democratic Liberal Party," with Romulo as the presidential candidate. Prior to this, the Philippine "Nacionalista Party" had already nominated the fascist military officer and former Defense Minister Magsaysay as a presidential candidate to compete with Quirino. With Romulo's participation in the election, the mutual infighting among the Philippine ruling cliques will become even more intense.

The Philippine election farce is being staged under the direction of American colonialists. Quirino is the number one puppet of the U.S. government. However, since 1946, although the U.S. government has given Quirino's group more than two billion U.S. dollars in "aid," Quirino has been unable to suppress the increasingly vigorous Philippine people's liberation movement. Therefore, the U.S. government is attempting to change its puppet lineup in the Philippines through the Philippine "general election," vainly hoping that this will make its colonial rule smoother. Under these circumstances, the United States has set its sights on Romulo and Magsaysay. As everyone knows, Romulo was until recently the Philippine Ambassador to the United States and Chief Representative to the United Nations, and has always been known for being a loyal servant of the United States. During his tenure as Minister of Defense, Magsaysay was appreciated by the United States for his brutal suppression of the people's liberation movement.

The U.S. colonialists' move to promote Romulo and Magsaysay as alternative candidates has made Quirino feel embarrassed. He is playing a rogue's trick in an attempt to make the United States back down. Quirino publicly told reporters: "The American ambassador is interfering in the internal affairs of the Philippines." Quirino's spokesperson, the current acting Defense Minister of the Philippine government, Castello, even made a gesture by giving an interview to a reporter from the "New York Times," "demanding that the United States not interfere in the Philippine 'general election,' otherwise it will be forced to file a complaint with the United Nations."

    美国指使罗慕洛等和季里诺“竞选”
    菲反动统治集团间矛盾加深
    【新华社三日讯】马尼拉消息：菲律宾统治集团正为了今年十一月的“大选”吵闹不休，内部矛盾日益尖锐。
    菲律宾政府党“自由党”在五月二十四日举行了代表大会，因提名总统候选人问题引起了内部分裂。当天的代表大会中“争吵谩骂使会议情况异常混乱”（美联社）。结果，现任菲律宾总统季里诺在会上被提名为下届总统候选人。与季里诺竞争当总统候选人的前菲律宾驻美大使罗慕洛及其追随者，包括现任菲律宾副总统洛佩兹在内，当天中途退出会场，并于五月二十六日宣布另组“民主自由党”，以罗慕洛为总统候选人。在这以前，菲律宾“国民党”已推出法西斯军人、前国防部长麦格赛赛为总统候选人，和季里诺竞选。罗慕洛参加竞选后，菲律宾统治集团间相互倾轧的情况将更加激烈。
    菲律宾的竞选丑剧是在美国殖民者的导演下演出的。季里诺是美国政府的第一号傀儡。但是，从一九四六年以来，美国政府虽然已给季里诺集团二十多亿美元的“援助”，季里诺却一直无法把日益蓬勃的菲律宾人民解放运动镇压下去。因此，美国政府企图通过菲律宾的“大选”，换一下它在菲律宾的傀儡班底，妄想这样将会使它的殖民统治更顺利些。在这种情况下，美国看中了罗慕洛和麦格赛赛。大家知道，罗慕洛在不久以前还是菲律宾驻美国大使和驻联合国首席代表，一向以充当美国的忠顺奴仆出名。麦格赛赛在担任国防部长期间，以残暴镇压人民解放运动，获得美国的赏识。
    美国殖民者另外捧罗慕洛和麦格赛赛出来竞选，已使季里诺感到狼狈。他耍出赖皮手段企图使美国退让。季里诺公开对新闻记者说：“美国大使正在干涉菲律宾的内政。”季里诺的代言人、现任菲律宾政府代理国防部长卡斯特洛更作出姿态，向美国“纽约时报”记者发表谈话，“要求美国不要干预菲律宾‘大选’，否则将被迫向联合国提出控诉”。
