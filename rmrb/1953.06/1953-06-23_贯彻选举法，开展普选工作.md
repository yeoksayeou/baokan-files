Songjiang Province Mobilizes Basic-Level Cadres to Lead the Universal Suffrage Work and Gains Experience

Songjiang Province has concluded its pilot work for basic-level elections and has summarized the experience of mobilizing basic-level cadres to lead the universal suffrage work.

In mid-May, Songjiang Province formed eight work teams that went to mining areas, forest areas, ethnic autonomous regions, towns, and rural areas in Shangzhi, Acheng, Jixi, and Yichun counties to conduct pilot work for basic-level elections. During their work, in addition to conducting in-depth research on the characteristics of each typical area, they paid special attention to mobilizing local basic-level cadres, encouraging them to come up with their own ideas and actively lead the universal suffrage work. The work teams first explained their intentions to the township cadres. They handed over the election work plans and methods that had been drafted in the county to them for research and revision, taking into account the actual situation of their villages. At the same time, they informed them of the work team's schedule to facilitate their initiative in the work. Secondly, they used spare time to convene representative meetings attended by village cadres, activists, and representative figures, announced the universal suffrage work plan, and briefly and understandably explained the great significance of universal suffrage. They also held on-the-spot discussions to make them understand the relationship between the election and themselves, and affirmed the work achievements of the village cadres who had good work styles and could serve the masses under the leadership of the higher-level government in the past. After the meeting, the participants in the informal discussions extensively carried out propaganda activities among the villagers. At the same time, the work teams paid attention to absorbing the village cadres who were supported by the masses to establish village election committees and formulate detailed election work plans, which were then announced at a general meeting of all villagers.

After these meetings were held, the village cadres and activists had a clearer understanding of the universal suffrage work. With the enthusiastic assistance of the work team cadres, they were able to actively and proactively lead the universal suffrage work. According to the urgent demands of the masses, the cadres of Zhengan Village in Shangzhi County discussed and decided on a plan to combine production with universal suffrage at the people's representative meeting. During the population survey and voter registration, they organized people in the village who were literate to conduct door-to-door surveys and registrations. This method was supported by the peasants, and their enthusiasm for production was even higher. They expressed that they would greet the universal suffrage with practical actions to complete the spring plowing. As a result, the village completed spring plowing ahead of schedule, and the pilot work for universal suffrage was successfully concluded. (Xinhua News Agency)

In Ge'lan Township, Changshou County, Sichuan, the Relationship Between Cadres and the Masses is Improved During Universal Suffrage

The Election Committee of Ge'lan Township, Changshou County, Sichuan Province, combined the pilot universal suffrage with the improvement of the relationship between cadres and the masses, and the effect was very good.

The cadres of Ge'lan Township have been tested by many social reforms and political movements. The vast majority of them have close ties with the masses, can conscientiously implement the government's policies, and actively lead the masses in production. They enjoy high prestige among the masses. However, due to the busy phenomenon of "five excesses" in rural areas, higher-level leaders use cadres a lot but educate them little. Therefore, some village cadres have varying degrees of commandism, and a few cadres are even seriously detached from the masses, or they have a relaxed mentality of hoping for a "change of shifts."

In order to further educate and improve the style of work of cadres through the masses in the universal suffrage movement, the Ge'lan Township Election Committee decided to adopt a mass-based work inspection method, fully promote democracy, and carry out criticism and self-criticism to improve the relationship between cadres and the masses. The township election committee first convened an enlarged meeting of township people's representatives and cadres. The main cadres of the district and township summarized the work of the entire township and inspected the bureaucratic leadership style, explaining that the village cadres should bear certain responsibility for the commandist leadership. The people's representatives and cadres attending the meeting put forward many pertinent criticisms and suggestions. The leading cadres of the district and township accepted everyone's opinions and made self-criticisms. The meeting also explained the government's policy of training and educating cadres, which greatly encouraged and educated the cadres attending the meeting, dispelling some people's concerns that "universal suffrage is to rectify cadres." After the meeting, the people's representatives and cadres conveyed the spirit of the meeting to the masses to carry out propaganda about the people's desire to be masters of their own affairs, and mobilized voters to give opinions to village cadres to help cadres improve their work style. This simultaneously eliminated some voters' concerns about cadres retaliating after they put forward their opinions and about hurting feelings. In addition, the Ge'lan Township branch of the Chinese Communist Party and the Communist Youth League also convened meetings of Party and League members to educate them, calling on everyone to humbly listen to the opinions of the masses and accept criticism from the masses. In this way, everyone made full ideological preparations and laid the foundation for carrying out criticism and self-criticism.

All eighty-two voter groups in the township gave opinions to the cadres. Some voters sternly criticized some cadres' relaxed mentality of "changing shifts," and some criticized cadres for not publicizing accounts when renovating offices and purchasing office supplies, and for not consulting with the masses in advance. Criticisms were also made of the shortcomings of the township's leading cadres who only focused on key villages and did not take care of the production of the entire township's masses. Such meetings were generally held two or three times in each voter group. Finally, small-scale representative meetings were also held in each electoral district. Three or four representatives were selected from each voter group to participate, and the voters' opinions were collected. At the meeting, good cadres who maintained contact with the masses and worked actively were commended, and their good working methods were introduced to set an example. At the same time, the cadres who were criticized also made self-criticisms at the meeting. After the meeting, the representatives conveyed the meeting situation to the masses separately.

After this profound democratic education, the relationship between cadres and the masses was further strengthened. Recently, in the preliminary list of representative candidates announced by the Ge'lan Township Election Committee, 80% of the existing village cadres have been nominated by the masses as representative candidates.

Basic-Level Election Pilot Work in Linxia's Mixed Hui, Han, and Dongxiang Ethnic Areas is Proceeding Steadily

The basic-level election pilot work in Xinzhen and Gucheng townships, Linxia County, Gansu Province, where Hui, Han, Dongxiang, and Salar ethnic groups live together, is proceeding steadily. The universal suffrage pilot work in these two townships began on May 19 and has now entered the second stage. Before carrying out the universal suffrage pilot work, both townships formulated practical universal suffrage pilot work plans and steps based on the Election Law and the local specific conditions, and made full preparations. In carrying out all work, these two townships paid special attention to the policies of ethnic equality and unity and respect for the customs and habits of minority ethnic groups. Before carrying out a series of work such as population surveys, voter registration, and determining voter qualifications, the cadres of the work team first visited representative figures and religious figures of all ethnic groups who had contact with the people, and held座谈会with imams and elders to fully exchange views on the relevant election work. Therefore, many imams automatically used the opportunity of 教民praying in mosques to publicize the Election Law. In order to further strengthen the unity between and within all ethnic groups and improve the political awareness and production enthusiasm of all ethnic groups, these two townships proceeded steadily in all their work, starting from ethnic unity, combining production, and relying on local ethnic cadres and activists.

According to statistics, Xinzhen and Gucheng townships have a total of 7,300 people from the Hui, Han, Dongxiang, and Salar ethnic groups, of which the Hui ethnic group accounts for 29.4%, the Han ethnic group accounts for 67.86%, the Dongxiang ethnic group accounts for 2.47%, and the Salar ethnic group accounts for 0.27%. Both townships completed land reform in the spring of 1952, and the unity between all ethnic groups has been increasing in recent years. (Xinhua News Agency)

Chongqing Municipal Election Committee Establishes Reception Office

The Chongqing Municipal Election Committee has established a universal suffrage reception office to specifically receive the masses who come to visit and ask about universal suffrage issues. The reception office divides the opinions of the masses who come to visit or write letters into four categories: accusations, complaints, inquiries, and requests, and handles them separately. It immediately answers what can be answered, and is responsible for forwarding what cannot be answered to the relevant departments for handling. This approach allows the opinions of the broad masses of people on universal suffrage to be quickly reflected, closely connects with the masses, and will greatly encourage the masses to actively participate in universal suffrage.

    贯彻选举法，开展普选工作
    松江省发动基层政权干部领导普选工作获得经验
    松江省已结束基层选举典型试办工作，并总结了发动基层政权干部领导普选工作的经验。
    松江省在五月中旬曾组成八个工作组，到尚志、阿城、鸡西和伊春等县的矿区、林区、民族自治区、城镇或农村进行基层选举典型试办工作。他们在工作中，除深入地研究了各典型地区的特点外，并特别注意发动当地的基层干部，使他们自己想办法、出主意，积极领导普选工作。工作组首先向当地的乡干部讲清工作组的来意。把在县里已拟就的选举工作计划和办法，交给他们结合本村实际情况来研究修正，同时使他们了解工作组的工作日程，便于他们在工作中发挥主动性。其次，利用空闲时间，召开村干部、积极分子和有代表性的人物参加的代表会议，宣布普选工作计划，简短通俗地讲解普选的伟大意义。当场并进行座谈，使他们认识选举与自己的关系，并肯定那些作风好、能为群众办事的村干部过去在上级政府领导下的工作成绩。会后，参加漫谈会的人就向全村群众广泛开展宣传活动；同时，工作组并注意吸收为群众所拥护的村干部，成立村选举委员会，订出详细的选举工作计划，然后在全村群众大会上宣布。
    以上这些会议开过后，村干部和积极分子对普选工作的认识已较明确，工作组干部再给予热心帮助，他们就能积极、主动地去领导普选工作。尚志县政安村的干部根据群众的迫切要求，在人民代表会议上讨论决定了结合生产进行普选的计划；在人口调查、选民登记时，组织本村粗通文字的人，进行挨家挨院地调查登记。这种办法得到农民拥护，生产情绪更为高涨，纷纷表示以完成春耕的实际行动来迎接普选。结果，该村提前完成春耕，普选典型试办工作也顺利结束。（据新华社讯）
    四川长寿县葛兰乡在普选中改善干部和群众关系
    四川省长寿县葛兰乡选举委员会在试办普选中，结合进行改善干部与群众的关系，效果很好。
    葛兰乡干部曾经过多次社会改革与政治运动的考验，极大多数都和群众有密切的联系，能认真贯彻政府的各项政策，积极领导群众生产，在群众中有很高的威信。但由于农村存在“五多”的忙乱现象，上级领导对干部使用多、教育少。因此有些乡村干部存在不同程度的强迫命令作风，少数干部甚至严重地脱离群众，或者产生希望“换班”的松劲思想。
    为了在普选运动中通过群众进一步教育改进作风，葛兰乡选举委员会决定采取群众性地检查工作的方式，充分发扬民主，开展批评与自我批评，以改善干部和群众的关系。乡选举委员会首先召开了乡人民代表及干部扩大会议。由区、乡主要干部总结全乡工作，并检查了官僚主义的领导作风，说明乡村干部的命令主义领导方面应负一定责任。到会的人民代表和干部提出了许多中肯的批评和意见。区、乡领导干部接受了大家的意见并作了检讨。会上还解释了政府培养教育干部的政策，使到会的干部受到很大的鼓舞和教育，解除了有些人认为“普选是整干部”的思想顾虑。会后，人民代表与干部又将会议精神传达到群众中去，进行人民要当家作主的宣传，发动选民对乡村干部提意见，帮助干部改进工作作风。这样就同时消除有些选民怕提了意见以后干部报复和怕伤情面等顾虑。另外，中共葛兰乡支部和青年团支部也召开了党、团员会议，向党、团员进行教育，号召大家虚心听取群众意见，接受群众批评。这样，大家都作好了充分的思想准备，给开展批评与自我批评打下基础。
    全乡八十二个选民小组都给干部提了意见。有的选民严正地批评了一些干部的“换班”松劲思想，有的批评干部在整修办公室、购办公物时不公布账目、事先不和群众商量等缺点。对于乡的领导干部只顾重点村没有照顾全乡群众生产的缺点，也都提出了批评的意见。这样的会议在各选民小组一般都召开过两三次。最后，各选区还召开小型代表会议，各选民小组选派三、四名代表参加，把选民意见集中上来。会上，表扬了联系群众、工作积极的好干部，介绍了他们好的工作方法以树立榜样；同时，被批评的干部在会上也作了检讨。会后，代表们又把会议情况分别向群众进行传达。
    经过这次深刻的民主教育以后，干部和群众的关系进一步地密切了。最近，葛兰乡选举委员会初步公布的代表候选人名单中，现有的百分之八十的乡村干部都被群众提名为代表候选人。

    临夏回、汉、东乡等民族杂居区基层选举试办工作正稳步进行
    甘肃省临夏县回、汉、东乡、撒拉等民族杂居的新集、古城乡的基层选举试办工作，正在稳步进行。这两个乡的普选试办工作在五月十九日开始，现已进入第二阶段。在进行普选试办工作前，这两个乡都根据选举法和当地的具体情况，制订了切合实际的普选试办工作计划和步骤，并充分地做好了准备工作。这两个乡在进行各项工作时，都特别注意民族平等、团结政策和尊重少数民族的风俗习惯。在进行人口调查、选民登记和确定选民资格等一系列的工作之前，工作组的干部首先拜访了各民族中与人民有联系的代表人物和宗教界人士，召开了阿訇、老人座谈会，充分交换了有关普选工作的意见。因此，许多阿訇在清真寺里，也自动利用教民作礼拜的机会，宣传选举法。为进一步加强各民族之间和各民族内部的团结，提高各族人民的政治觉悟和生产积极性，这两个乡在一切工作中，都是从民族团结出发，结合生产，依靠当地本民族干部和积极分子稳健地进行。
    按新集、古城两乡共有回、汉、东乡、撒拉四个民族，七千三百多人，其中回族占百分之二十九点四，汉族占百分之六十七点八六，东乡族占百分之二点四七，撒拉族占百分之零点二七。这两个乡都在一九五二年春天完成了土地改革工作，几年来各民族之间的团结已日益加强。（新华社）
    重庆市选举委员会设立接待室
    重庆市选举委员会设立了普选接待室，专门接待为普选问题来访的人民群众。接待室将群众来访或来信的意见分为检举、控告、询问和要求四类分别处理，能解答的立刻解答，不能解答的便负责转给有关部门处理。这样的做法使广大人民群众对普选的意见能很快的反映上来，密切了与群众的联系，并将大大鼓舞人民群众参加普选的积极性。
