Two-Week Reader Letter Processing Report

From June 8th to June 21st, the reader letter group of this newspaper received a total of 3,043 reader letters, and various agencies replied to 769 reader letters. Among them, 1,367 letters were related to political and legal issues, 1,334 letters were related to industrial and agricultural production and financial issues, 1,043 letters were related to cultural and educational issues, and 68 letters were of other nature; in addition, there were 494 letters from family members of revolutionary soldiers seeking revolutionary soldiers, which were not included in the statistics. During the same period, 192 letters were published in this newspaper, 983 letters were answered individually, 1,696 letters were transferred to relevant agencies for investigation, processing, reply, or reference, and 1,494 letters were kept for reference by this newspaper and did not require further processing; some of these were letters left over from before. During this period, the reader letter group of this newspaper sent a total of 4,845 letters replying to readers, transferring letters to various agencies for investigation and processing, and urging replies.

During the past two weeks, we received some reader letters reflecting the ideological situation of village cadres and the people in some pilot areas for grassroots elections regarding election work and population census work. These letters are very helpful for us to understand the situation and problems in the pilot work of grassroots elections in various places, and we have kept them for reference. We hope readers will continue to send letters reflecting this situation.

During the past two weeks, we received many reader letters exposing the poor quality of products from certain factories; reflecting on railway traffic accidents; and continuing to expose problems in the implementation of the transportation responsibility system in certain railway units. We are currently studying these letters intensively and preparing to publish a comprehensive report. We are studying and processing letters from readers reflecting that some state-owned factories and mines are hastily compiling plans with an attitude of perfunctoriness, and that many mails in some railway units cannot be shipped out in a timely manner.

During the past two weeks, we also continued to receive many reader letters reflecting problems such as chaotic teaching work, undemocratic leadership style, declining student health, or difficulties in internships in certain institutions of higher learning, as well as letters reflecting the poor health of students in certain worker-peasant rapid middle schools; we will select excerpts from some representative letters for publication, and the remaining letters will be processed centrally. Some reader letters reflect that some schools use people's scholarships as a means of reward, and some put forward suggestions on the adjustment of departments and faculties in institutions of higher learning and the selection of students to study abroad; we have forwarded these letters to the cultural and educational leading organs for reference and processing. We have forwarded letters reflecting that students in graduating classes of primary and secondary schools in some areas are "burning the midnight oil" in preparation for examinations, which affects their health, to the relevant local education administrative departments for reference. In addition, many readers have written to inquire about issues related to purchasing books; we hope that readers will inquire about these issues at the local Xinhua Bookstore or other book and periodical distribution agencies.
