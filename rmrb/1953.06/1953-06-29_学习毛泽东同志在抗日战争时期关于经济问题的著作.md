When we read Comrade Mao Zedong's works from various periods, we can see many important specialized works on economic issues, or extremely incisive discussions on economic issues contained in other works. Comrade Mao Zedong's concern for economic issues is by no means accidental, but is consistent with his Marxist historical materialist viewpoint. Because the Marxist historical materialism tells us: the economy is the foundation of society. What determines the direction of human history is not some individual's will, but the production of material means of subsistence for humanity and the economic relations formed among people in production. Therefore, "If the proletarian party wants to become a real party, it should first of all be well-versed in the laws of production development, the laws of socio-economic development. ... In order not to make mistakes in politics, the proletarian party should, when formulating its own party program and carrying out practical activities, first proceed from the laws of production development, from the laws of socio-economic development." (Stalin: "Dialectical Materialism and Historical Materialism") In all his theoretical and practical activities, Comrade Mao Zedong has proceeded from the laws of China's socio-economic development. In his early works, he showed close attention to China's socio-economic conditions. In the first volume of the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," we read at the beginning "Analysis of the Classes in Chinese Society," such a rigorous scientific paper. This paper gave a detailed discussion and investigation of the economic status of the various classes in Chinese society at that time, their interrelationships, and their consequent attitudes towards the revolution. It was on the basis of this analysis of the various classes in China that Comrade Mao Zedong prescribed the entire combat deployment for the Chinese working class. Afterwards, Comrade Mao Zedong also proceeded from the laws of China's economic development, correctly defining the nature, tasks, targets, driving forces, and prospects of the Chinese revolution, formulating many basic guidelines and policies for the various periods of the Chinese revolution, and thereby criticizing many erroneous non-Marxist viewpoints, guidelines, and policies. Comrade Mao Zedong wrote: "The good or bad, the great or small effect of the policies and practices of all political parties in China upon the Chinese people depends ultimately on whether, and how much, they help to develop their productive forces, and on whether they fetter or liberate these forces." ("On Coalition Government") In this way, Comrade Mao Zedong armed the Chinese people with a revolutionary program that conformed to the laws of China's socio-economic development and was suited to the development of China's social productive forces, and pushed forward the giant wheel of Chinese history.

The several articles on economic issues in the third volume of the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" were written by Comrade Mao Zedong after 1941, that is, after the War of Resistance Against Japan entered a difficult stalemate. During this period, Japanese imperialism had discovered that the reactionary Kuomintang government was not its real opponent, and therefore turned its aggressive edge to the various liberated areas led by the Communist Party. During this period, except for the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region where the Party Central Committee was located, all other liberated areas entered a brutal battle rarely seen in human history. At the same time, the reactionary Kuomintang government became increasingly passive about the War of Resistance Against Japan, and its anti-communist and anti-people activities became increasingly active. It concentrated a large number of troops around the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region and other liberated areas. Although the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region was able to maintain a relatively stable situation during this period, due to the blockade by the Kuomintang army, coupled with the fact that the region was originally sparsely populated and its production was underdeveloped, it also encountered serious economic difficulties. Comrade Mao Zedong wrote when recalling the situation during this period: "The greatest difficulty was in 1940 and 1941, during the two anti-Communist frictions of the Kuomintang, which both occurred during this period. We were once reduced to almost having no clothes to wear, no oil to eat, no paper, no vegetables, soldiers with no shoes and socks, and staff with no quilts in winter. The Kuomintang treated us by stopping funding and imposing economic blockades, attempting to starve us to death. Our difficulties were truly extreme." ("Economic and Financial Problems During the War of Resistance Against Japan") But this difficulty did not make the soldiers and civilians of the liberated areas succumb. Under the wise leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong, the soldiers and civilians of the liberated areas not only overcame the difficulties, developed production, and improved their material living conditions, but also prepared a material foundation for the subsequent counteroffensive. The several articles on economic issues in the third volume of the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" were powerful weapons given to the entire Party and the people of the entire liberated area at that time.

In 1940, in order to overcome the huge economic difficulties, Comrade Mao Zedong called on all the soldiers and civilians of the liberated areas to launch a large-scale production movement. Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out that only by relying on our own hands, by producing material wealth in labor, is it the only correct way to solve difficulties; and merely trying to reduce the necessary expenditures and simply circling around financial problems is an old and conservative view. Comrade Mao Zedong criticized this old and conservative view, and pointed out: Some comrades have the mistaken idea of disregarding the needs of the war and only emphasizing that the government should implement "benevolent governance." Comrade Mao Zedong believed that: "If the War of Resistance Against Japan is not victorious, the so-called 'benevolent governance' will only be applied to Japanese imperialism, and it will be irrelevant to the people." ("Economic and Financial Problems During the War of Resistance Against Japan") However, Comrade Mao Zedong went on to teach us that if we do not first solve the problem of developing the economy, that is, developing the people's economy and the public economy in the liberated areas, but simply reach out to the people for money, or "drain the pond to catch the fish, and demand endlessly," then this is a Kuomintang ideology. In this way, Comrade Mao Zedong prescribed the famous formula of "develop the economy, ensure supply." Here, Comrade Mao Zedong profoundly elaborated the relationship between finance and economy, and clarified what is the real foundation for meeting people's material needs. Comrade Mao Zedong wrote: "Developing the economy and ensuring supply is the general policy for our economic and financial work. ... The quality of financial policy can certainly affect the economy, but it is the economy that determines finance. There is no way to solve financial difficulties without an economic foundation, and there is no way to make finance ample without economic development." (Ibid.) Comrade Mao Zedong also pointed out: "If we do not develop the people's economy and the public economy, we will only be waiting for death. Financial difficulties can only be solved through practical and effective economic development." (Ibid.) Under the guidance of this general policy prescribed by Comrade Mao Zedong, all the soldiers and civilians of the liberated areas confidently launched a vigorous production movement to fight for the development of the public economy and the people's economy. This great production movement once generated an incredible great force, improving the economic conditions of the liberated areas. Especially in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region at that time, due to the direct leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong and the Party Central Committee, the entire socio-economy was widely developed, and the lives of soldiers and civilians even reached the level of abundance. In contrast, the Kuomintang-controlled areas at that time were in a state of economic decline and the people were living in dire straits.

In the great production movement, Comrade Mao Zedong also criticized an over-leftist tendency of blind development that existed at that time. Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out: "The Party's line is the correct line of development. On the one hand, we must oppose the old and conservative views, and on the other hand, we must oppose the empty and unrealistic grand plans. This is the struggle on the two fronts of the Party in financial and economic work." (Ibid.) Comrade Mao Zedong especially reminded everyone to make their thinking adapt to their environment, and to consider problems from their current environment. Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out that the environment we were in at that time "is a rural base area built on an individual economic foundation, divided by the enemy, and therefore also a guerrilla war. If everything we do starts from this point, it seems that the results are very slow and not vigorous, but in fact, compared with those who do not start from this point but from other points, for example, from the urban point of view, what will be the effect of the work? It will definitely not be very slow, but very fast." ("Must Learn to Do Economic Work") Because Comrade Mao Zedong deeply studied the basic characteristics of the economic environment at that time and grasped the objective laws of development, he most effectively promoted the economic development of the liberated areas and made the forces of the people's revolution increasingly strong.

According to the objective situation at that time, Comrade Mao Zedong divided the economic work of the liberated areas into two major parts. One part was to develop the people's economy. At that time, although the people's governments and armies in the liberated areas had established a fairly large-scale public agriculture and industry under the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong, the people's supply of funds for the War of Resistance, especially the supply of grain, was still an extremely important part. Comrade Mao Zedong taught us: "The view of not using all efforts to help the masses develop production, but only knowing how to ask the masses for grain and money (the Kuomintang view), is wrong." ("Carry Out the Movements of Rent Reduction, Production, and Support the Government and Cherish the People in the Base Areas") Comrade Mao Zedong instructed: "On the one hand, we take from the people, and on the other hand, we must increase and supplement the people's economy. This is to adopt appropriate steps and methods to help the development of the people's agriculture, animal husbandry, handicraft industry, salt industry, and commerce, so that the people will have something to lose and at the same time something to gain, and that the gains will be greater than the losses." ("Economic and Financial Problems During the War of Resistance Against Japan") These instructions not only expressed Comrade Mao Zedong's great and profound concern for the people, taught us to oppose the bureaucratic style of work that does not care about the people's suffering, but also contained an extremely important principle, that is, at any time, even in the case of a serious war, organizing the people to produce, so that "the people's economy will increase," should become a basic task in revolutionary work. If this point is neglected, or the development of production is hindered by improperly emphasizing other tasks, the material foundation of the revolutionary cause will be weakened, and the development of the revolutionary cause will be harmed.

During the War of Resistance Against Japan, the people's economy of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region grew rapidly under the personal guidance of Comrade Mao Zedong.

Since agriculture was the main production sector in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, Comrade Mao Zedong focused on studying various issues related to agricultural production.

Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out according to the situation at that time: In order to develop agricultural production, two guidelines must be adopted, namely rent reduction and interest reduction and the organization of labor mutual aid. Because of the rent reduction and interest reduction, the feudal exploitation suffered by the peasants was reduced, thereby increasing the enthusiasm for production; and because the peasants shifted from decentralized management to collective mutual assistance, the labor productivity of agriculture was greatly developed.

As everyone knows, Comrade Mao Zedong had a very profound study of the Chinese countryside early on. Based on the experience of this period, he not only specifically prescribed the current guidelines for developing agricultural production, solved the various problems existing in the development of agricultural production in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region at that time, but also formulated the basic program for the socialist transformation of agriculture throughout the entire New Democratic period in accordance with the principles of Marxism-Leninism. In the famous article "Get Organized!" published in November 1943, Comrade Mao Zedong thoroughly expounded this issue. Comrade Mao Zedong wrote: "As for the masses of peasants, for thousands of years they have been an individual economy, and each household is a production unit. This decentralized individual production is the economic foundation of feudal rule, and it makes the peasants themselves fall into eternal poverty. The only way to overcome this situation is to gradually collectivize; and the only way to achieve collectivization, according to Lenin, is through cooperatives." ("Get Organized!") However, the cooperative mutual aid organization in the countryside at that time was still a low-level form of cooperative, which was different from the Soviet collective farm-style cooperative of a socialist nature. Comrade Mao Zedong gave a classic definition to such a cooperative: this cooperative is "a collective labor organization based on an individual economy (based on private property)." He wrote: "In the border area, we have now organized many peasant cooperatives, but these are currently only a preliminary form of cooperative, and will have to go through several stages of development before they will develop into a cooperative of the Soviet type called a collective farm in the future." (Ibid.) Due to the publication of "Get Organized!", the Chinese peasants, who had been deeply trapped in the feudal dark rule for thousands of years, not only saw the bright future prospects, but also clearly saw the specific path they would follow.

The other part of the economic work in the liberated areas at that time was to develop the public economy. The public economy not only included various agriculture and industries run by the government, but also many agricultural and industrial production run by various agencies and troops themselves. The vast majority of the staff of the agencies and the commanders and fighters of the troops participated in the vigorous great production movement and personally participated in the labor. This great production movement provided a large amount of material wealth for the liberated areas and greatly reduced the burden on the people of the liberated areas. In 1945, Comrade Mao Zedong told us: the fine grain (millet) required annually by the troops and agencies in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, about two-fifths is self-supplied by the production of the agencies and troops. Because the vast number of cadres and soldiers carried out production, some troops could almost achieve complete self-sufficiency. As for the various agencies, because the labor force is generally weaker than the troops, most of them, in addition to food and clothing being supplied by the government, have either completely self-sufficient or partially self-sufficient items. (See "Must Learn to Do Economic Work").

Not only that, this great production movement also tempered people's ideological awareness. Many intellectuals who had never distinguished the five grains and had never participated in productive labor were transformed in the production movement. In addition, according to Comrade Mao Zedong's analysis, the production movement produced at least the following effects: 1. Improved the relationship between officers and soldiers; 2. Enhanced the soldiers' labor viewpoint in the troops; 3. Enhanced discipline; 4. Improved the relationship between the army and the people; 5. The relationship between the military and the government is also better; 6. Due to the development of the production movement in agencies and troops, the universal production increase movement of the entire people is even more vigorous. (See "On the Importance of Self-Sufficiency in Army Production, and on the Rectification and Production Movements") Comrade Mao Zedong also taught us at that time: "Anyone who does not pay attention to studying production is not a good leader. All military and civilian personnel who do not pay attention to production but are fond of eating and lazy are not good soldiers or good citizens." ("Carry Out the Movements of Rent Reduction, Production, and Support the Government and Cherish the People in the Base Areas"). Comrade Mao Zedong instructed that whether it is developing the public economy or developing the people's economy, it is equally necessary to adopt the guideline of organizing the strength of the masses, and to oppose the guideline of lacking a mass viewpoint, not relying on the masses, and not organizing the masses. According to the guidelines instructed by Comrade Mao Zedong, the strength of all troops, agencies, and schools in the liberated areas was widely organized and became a large labor force; this large labor force, under the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong, won a comprehensive victory on the economic front.

However, it must be remembered here that regarding the self-sufficient economy of troops and agencies, Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out as early as 1942 that it could only exist under certain historical conditions. If it is viewed apart from specific historical conditions, then it would become unreasonable. Comrade Mao Zedong wrote: "The self-sufficient economy developed by the army, agencies, and schools is a special product under the current special conditions. It is unreasonable and incomprehensible under other historical conditions, but it is completely reasonable and completely necessary at present." ("Economic and Financial Problems During the War of Resistance Against Japan") Therefore, we should not take a negative attitude towards the self-sufficient economy of troops and agencies that once existed during the War of Resistance Against Japan because it violates the principle of the division of labor in society, but should recognize its great historical significance; on the other hand, we must also remember Comrade Mao Zedong's instructions that it is a product of certain historical conditions and cannot be applied at any time or in any place.
               ×××

During the War of Resistance Against Japan, Comrade Mao Zedong, proceeding from the specific objective economic situation at that time, developed his own ideas on economic issues in many aspects on the basis of Marxist-Leninist doctrines. Once this ideology was grasped by the broad masses of the people in the liberated areas, it immediately became a huge and invincible material force, becoming a vigorous great production movement. In 1945, Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out to us: this production movement and the rectification movement were the two main links in the entire revolutionary chain at that time. If these two links are not grasped, the entire revolutionary chain cannot be grasped, and the revolutionary cause cannot move forward.

During the War of Resistance Against Japan, the number of members of the Chinese Communist Party increased greatly; if a universal Marxist education movement, namely the rectification movement, was not carried out for such a large number of party members whose ideology was not completely in line with Marxism, the revolutionary cause could not naturally move forward.

Comrade Mao Zedong, on the one hand, grasped the link of the rectification movement, which made our Party unprecedentedly unified ideologically, politically, and organizationally; on the other hand, he grasped the link of production, which laid a material foundation for the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan. As Comrade Mao Zedong said, they played a decisive role in the spiritual and material life, respectively.

During this period, many important instructions made by Comrade Mao Zedong on economic issues, although mainly to solve a series of practical problems at that time, are basic principles with universal nature, and are still indispensable pointers for our work today.

These important instructions are:

Only by developing the economy can financial problems be correctly solved; otherwise, it is impossible to correctly solve financial problems.

Chinese peasants can only rapidly increase productivity and finally get rid of poverty by following the path of cooperatives instructed by Lenin.

Most of our efforts must be devoted to helping peasants develop production, and a small part of our efforts to obtaining taxes from the peasants. "If our comrades who are doing local work are divorced from the masses, do not understand the feelings of the masses, and cannot help the masses organize production and improve their lives, and only know how to ask them for patriotic public grain, but do not know how to first use 90 percent of their energy to help the masses solve their 'private grain to save the people' problems, and then only use 10 percent of their energy to solve the patriotic public grain problems, then, this is tainted with the Kuomintang style and tainted with the dust of bureaucracy."
    ("Get Organized!")

No matter when, no matter what problems are dealt with, Communist Party members must closely integrate with the masses, rely on the masses, and the same is true in economic work.

In carrying out any economic work, we must first proceed from the current objective economic environment, make our thinking conform to the objective economic conditions; we must formulate our work guidelines and plans according to the objective conditions, and cannot formulate any guidelines and plans according to our subjective wishes. If we use the urban viewpoint to deal with rural issues based on an individual economy, or disregard the changed objective situation and bring the working methods of small-scale production in the countryside during the War of Resistance Against Japan to the modern industrial sectors, we cannot but make mistakes in our work and cannot but hinder the development of our work.

When the War of Resistance Against Japan was still in a difficult stage, Comrade Mao Zedong wrote: "Our current difficulties, some have already been overcome, and some are about to be overcome. We have experienced times that were many times more difficult than now, and we have overcome those difficulties. The difficulties in the base areas of North China and Central China are much greater than those in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region. There are serious wars there every day. They have been supporting it for five and a half years, and they will definitely be able to continue to support it until victory. There is no pessimism in front of us, and we can overcome any difficulties." ("Economic and Financial Problems During the War of Resistance Against Japan") Today, the Chinese people, who have overcome countless difficulties and defeated many powerful enemies under the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong, are fighting to build a new industrialized China. Although there are still some difficulties in front of us, as long as we firmly grasp Comrade Mao Zedong's ideology and follow the path he has instructed, we will surely achieve greater and more glorious victories than in the past.

    学习毛泽东同志在抗日战争时期关于经济问题的著作
    何均
    当我们阅读毛泽东同志各个时期的著作时，都可以看到不少重要的有关经济问题的专门论著，或包含在其他著作中的极其精辟的关于经济问题的论述。毛泽东同志对于经济问题这样的关心，决不是偶然的，而是和他的马克思主义的历史唯物主义的观点相一致的。因为马克思主义的历史唯物论告诉我们：经济是社会的基础。决定人类历史发展方向的，不是某种个人的意志，而是人类为获取自己的物质生活资料的生产以及在生产中所形成的人们之间的经济关系。所以，“无产阶级党要想成为真正的党，首先就应精通生产发展底规律，社会经济发展底规律。……为了在政治上不犯错误，无产阶级党在制定自己的党纲以及进行实际活动时，首先应以生产发展底规律，应以社会经济发展底规律为出发点”。（斯大林：“辩证唯物主义与历史唯物主义”）毛泽东同志在自己的全部理论的和实际的活动中，正是以中国社会经济发展规律为出发点的。他在自己的早期著作中就表现了对于中国社会经济状况的密切的注意。在“毛泽东选集”第一卷中，我们一开头就读到“中国社会各阶级的分析”这样一篇严整的科学性的论文。这篇论文对于当时中国社会各阶级的经济地位、相互间的关系以及它们因此而产生的对革命的态度，都作了详尽的论述和考察。毛泽东同志就在这种对中国各阶级分析的基础上，为中国工人阶级规定了整个战斗的部署。往后，毛泽东同志也正是以中国社会的经济发展规律为出发点，正确地规定了中国革命的性质、任务、对象、动力和前途，制定了中国革命各个时期的许多基本的方针和政策，从而又批判了许多错误的非马克思主义观点的方针和政策。毛泽东同志曾写道：“中国一切政党的政策及其实践在中国人民中所表现的作用的好坏、大小，归根到底，看它对于中国人民的生产力的发展是否有帮助及其帮助之大小，看它是束缚生产力的，还是解放生产力的”。（“论联合政府”）这样，毛泽东同志正是以符合于中国社会经济发展规律的、适合于中国社会生产力之发展的革命纲领，武装了中国人民，推动了中国历史巨轮的前进。
    在“毛泽东选集”第三卷中关于经济问题的几篇论文，是毛泽东同志在一九四一年以后，也就是在抗日战争进入艰苦的相持阶段以后所写成的。在这个时期，日本帝国主义已经发现反动的国民党政府并不是它的真正的敌手，因而把它的侵略锋芒转向了共产党所领导的各个解放区。在这个时期，除了党中央所在地的陕甘宁边区以外，其他各解放区都进入了人类历史上少有的残酷的战斗。与此同时，反动的国民党政府对抗日战争日益消极，对反共反人民的活动则日趋积极。它集中了大量的兵力在陕甘宁边区以及其他各解放区的周围。陕甘宁边区虽然在这个时期中还能够保持一个相对的安定局面，但由于国民党军队的封锁，再加上这个地区原来就人口稀少，生产不发展，所以也同样遇到了严重的经济困难。毛泽东同志在回溯这个时期的情形时曾写道：“最大的一次困难是在一九四○年和一九四一年，国民党的两次反共磨擦，都在这一时期。我们曾经弄到几乎没有衣穿，没有油吃，没有纸，没有菜，战士没有鞋袜，工作人员在冬天没有被盖。国民党用停发经费和经济封锁来对待我们，企图把我们困死，我们的困难真是大极了。”（“抗日时期的经济问题和财政问题”）但这种困难并没有使解放区军民屈服。解放区军民在毛泽东同志英明的领导下，不仅克服了困难，发展了生产，改善了自己物质生活状况，并且为以后的大反攻准备下了物质基础。“毛泽东选集”第三卷中的几篇关于经济问题的论文，就是给予当时全党和全解放区人民的有力的武器。
    当一九四○年，为了克服巨大的经济困难，毛泽东同志曾号召全体解放区军民发动一个大规模的生产运动。毛泽东同志曾指出，只有依靠自己的双手，在劳动中生产出物质财富来，才是解决困难的唯一的正确途径；而仅仅企图缩减必不可少的开支，单纯地在财政问题上打圈子，乃是一种陈旧的保守观点。毛泽东同志批判了这种陈旧的保守观点，并且指出：在有些同志中有一种不顾战争的需要，只强调政府应施行“仁政”的错误想法。毛泽东同志认为：“抗日战争如果不胜利，所谓‘仁政’不过是施在日本帝国主义身上，于人民是不相干的。”（“抗日时期的经济问题和财政问题”）但是，毛泽东同志接着又教导我们，如果不首先解决发展经济的问题，即发展解放区的人民经济和公营经济，而只是伸手向老百姓要，或“竭泽而渔，诛求无已”这就是一种国民党的思想。这样，毛泽东同志就规定了“发展经济，保障供给”这一著名的公式。在这里，毛泽东同志深刻地阐明了财政和经济的关系，阐明了什么是满足人们物质生活需要的真正基础。毛泽东同志写道：“发展经济，保障供给，是我们的经济工作和财政工作的总方针。……财政政策的好坏固然足以影响经济，但是决定财政的却是经济，未有经济无基础而可以解决财政困难的，未有经济不发展而可以使财政充裕的。”（同上）毛泽东同志还指出：“如果不发展人民经济和公营经济，我们就只有束手待毙。财政困难，只有从切切实实的有效的经济发展上才能解决。”（同上）在毛泽东同志所规定的这个总方针指导之下，全体解放区军民就满怀信心地展开了一个为发展公营经济和人民经济而斗争的轰轰烈烈的大生产运动。这个大生产运动曾经产生了一种令人难以置信的巨大力量，改善了各解放区的经济状况。特别是当时的陕甘宁边区，由于毛泽东同志和党中央的直接领导，整个社会经济获得了广泛的发展，军民生活竟达到了丰衣足食的水平。与此相反，当时国民党统治区，却正处于经济衰败，民不聊生的窘境。
    在大生产运动中，毛泽东同志又批判了当时曾存在着的一种过左的盲目发展的错误倾向。毛泽东同志指出：“党的路线是正确的发展路线，一方面要反对陈旧的保守的观点，另一方面又要反对空洞的不切实际的大计划。这就是党在财政经济工作中的两条战线上的斗争。”（同上）毛泽东同志曾特别提醒大家，要大家使自己的思想适合于自己所处的环境，要从自己当前所处的环境出发来考虑问题。毛泽东同志指出，当时我们所处的环境“是一个建立在个体经济基础上的、被敌人分割的、因而又是游击战争的农村根据地，如果我们所做的一切都是从这一点出发，看起来收效很慢，并不轰轰烈烈，但是在实际上，比较那种不从这一点出发而从别一点出发，例如说，从城市观点出发，其工作效果会怎么样呢？那就决不是很慢，反而是很快的。”（“必须学会做经济工作”）由于毛泽东同志深刻地研究了当时经济环境的基本特点，掌握了客观的发展规律，就最有效地推动了解放区的经济的发展，使人民革命的力量日益壮大起来。
    根据当时的客观情况，毛泽东同志曾把解放区的经济工作分成两大部分。一部分是发展人民经济。当时，虽然在毛泽东同志领导下，各解放区人民政府和军队都已建立起了具有相当规模的公营农业和工业，但人民对抗日经费的供给，特别是粮食的供给，仍然是一个极其重要的部分。毛泽东同志教导我们说：“不知用全力帮助群众发展生产，只知向群众要粮要款的观点（国民党观点），是错误的。”（“开展根据地的减租、生产和拥政爱民运动”）毛泽东同志指示：“我们一方面取之于民，一方面就要使人民经济有所增长，有所补充。这就是对人民的农业、畜牧业、手工业、盐业和商业，采取帮助其发展的适当步骤和办法，使人民有所失同时又有所得，并且使所得大于所失”（“抗日时期的经济问题和财政问题”）。在这些指示中，不仅表现了毛泽东同志对人民群众的伟大的深切的关怀，教导了我们在工作中要反对不关心人民疾苦的官僚主义作风，同时还包含有一个极其重要原则，那就是在任何时候，甚至在有着严重的战争情况下，组织人民群众生产，使“人民经济有所增长”，都应成为革命工作中的一项基本任务。如果忽视了这
    一点，或因不适当地强调其他方面的任务而妨碍了生产的发展，就将削弱革命事业的物质基础，就将使革命事业的发展受到损害。
    抗日战争时期，陕甘宁边区的人民经济，曾在毛泽东同志亲自指导下获得了迅速的增长。
    由于陕甘宁边区主要的生产部门还是农业，所以毛泽东同志就着重地研究了有关农业生产的各种问题。
    毛泽东同志根据当时情况指出：为了发展农业生产，必须采取两个方针，即减租减息和组织劳动互助。由于减租减息，就减轻了农民所受的封建剥削，从而提高了生产的积极性；又由于农民从分散经营转到集体互助，就使农业的劳动生产率大大地发展了一步。
    如大家所知道的，毛泽东同志对于中国农村早就有过极精深的研究，再根据这一时期的经验，他就不仅具体地规定了当前发展农业生产的方针，解决了当前陕甘宁边区农业生产发展中所存在的各种问题，而且按照马克思列宁主义的原则，为中国整个新民主主义时期制定了农业社会主义改造的基本纲领。在一九四三年十一月发表的有名的“组织起来”这篇论文中，毛泽东同志透彻地阐述了这个问题。毛泽东同志写道：“在农民群众方面，几千年来都是个体经济，一家一户就是一个生产单位，这种分散的个体生产，就是封建统治的经济基础，而使农民自己陷于永远的穷苦。克服这种状况的唯一办法，就是逐渐地集体化；而达到集体化的唯一道路，依据列宁所说，就是经过合作社。”（“组织起来”）不过，当时农村中的合作互助组织还是一种低级形式的合作社，与苏联的那种社会主义性质的集体农庄式的合作社还是有区别的。对于这样一种合作社，毛泽东同志给了一个经典的定义：这种合作社是“建立在个体经济基础上（私有财产基础上）的集体劳动组织”。他写道：“在边区，我们现在已经组织了许多的农民合作社，不过这些在目前还是一种初级形式的合作社，还要经过若干发展阶段，才会在将来发展为苏联式的被称为集体农庄的那种合作社。”（同上）由于“组织起来”这一著作的发表，几千年来深陷于封建黑暗统治之下的中国农民，就不仅看到了自己的未来的光明远景，而且看清楚了自己所将循以前进的具体道路。
    当时解放区经济工作的另一部分，是发展公营经济。公营经济不仅包含有政府所举办的各种农业和工业，而且还有各机关部队自己所经营的许多农业和工业生产。当时的机关工作人员和部队的指战员，极大部分都投入了轰轰烈烈的大生产运动中，亲身参加了劳动。这个大生产运动，曾为各解放区提供了大量的物质财富，大大地减轻了解放区人民的负担。在一九四五年时，毛泽东同志告诉我们：陕甘宁边区部队和机关每年所需细粮（小米），由机关部队生产自给的即约达五分之二。由于广大的干部和战士进行了生产，有些部队差不多能做到全部自给。至于各机关则因劳动力一般地较部队弱，所以多半除粮食和被服由政府供给外，其他各项有全部自给的，也有部分自给的。（参见“必须学会做经济工作”）。
    不仅如此，这个大生产运动还锻炼了人们的思想意识。许多过去五谷不分的、从未参加过生产劳动的知识分子，都在生产运动中得到了改造。此外，根据毛泽东同志的分析，生产运动至少还产生了以下的作用：一、改善了官兵关系；二、增强了部队中战士的劳动观点；三、增强了纪律性；四、改善了军民关系；五、军政关系也更好了；六、由于机关和部队生产运动的开展，全体人民的普遍增产运动也就更有劲了。（参见“论军队生产自给，兼论整风和生产两大运动的重要性”）毛泽东同志当时还教导我们说：“凡不注重研究生产的人，不算好的领导者。一切军民人等凡不注意生产反而好吃懒做的，不算好军人、好公民。”（“开展根据地的减租生产和拥政爱民运动”）。毛泽东同志指示：不论是发展公营经济或发展人民经济，都同样地必须采用把群众的力量组织起来的方针，而反对缺乏群众观点、不依靠群众、不组织群众的方针。按照毛泽东同志所指示的方针，解放区一切部队机关学校的力量都广泛地组织起来，成为一支劳动大军；这支劳动大军在毛泽东同志的率领下，在经济战线上获得了全面的胜利。
    不过，这里必须记住，关于部队和机关的生产自给经济，毛泽东同志早在一九四二年就曾指出：它只能是在一定历史条件下存在的，如果离开具体的历史条件来看，那末它就会变成不合理的了。毛泽东同志写道：“军队和机关学校所发展的这种自给经济是目前这种特殊条件下的特殊产物，它在其他历史条件下是不合理的和不可理解的，但在目前却是完全合理并且完全必要的”。（“抗日时期的经济问题和财政问题”）因此，我们对于过去曾经存在于抗日战争时期的那种部队和机关的自给经济，一方面不应因为它违反了社会分工的原则而采取否定的态度，而要认识到它的伟大的历史意义；另一方面还必须记住毛泽东同志的指示，即它是一定历史条件下的产物，不是在任何时候，任何场合可以搬用的。
               ×××
    在抗日战争时期，毛泽东同志从当时的具体客观经济情况出发，在马克思列宁主义学说基础上，在许多方面发挥了自己的关于经济问题的思想。这种思想一经为解放区广大人民群众所掌握以后，就立即成为巨大的不可战胜的物质力量，成为蓬蓬勃勃的大生产运动。一九四五年，毛泽东同志曾向我们指出：这个生产运动和整风运动是当时整个革命链条中的两个主要环节。如果不抓住这两个环节，也就无法抓住整个的革命链条，革命事业也就无法前进。
    在抗日战争时期，中国共产党党员的人数曾大大地增加起来；对于这样一批人数众多的思想上不完全符合于马克思主义的党员，如果不进行一次普遍的马克思主义的教育运动，即整风运动，革命事业自然是不能前进的。
    毛泽东同志一方面抓住了整风运动的这个环节，就使得我们党在思想上、政治上和组织上空前地统一起来；另一方面又抓住生产这个环节，就为抗日战争的胜利奠定了物质的基础。正如毛泽东同志所说，它们分别在精神生活方面和物质生活方面起了决定性的作用。
    在这个时期，毛泽东同志在经济问题上所作的许多重要指示，虽然主要地是为了解决当时一系列的实际问题，但却是具有普遍性质的基本原则，直到今天仍为我们工作中的不可缺少的指针。
    这些重要的指示就是：
    只有发展经济，才能使财政问题得到正确的解决；否则，就不可能正确地解决财政问题。
    中国农民只有按照列宁所指示的合作社的道路前进，才能迅速地提高生产力，并最后摆脱贫困的境遇。
    必须以大部分力量去帮助农民发展生产，以小部分力量从农民取得税收。“如果我们做地方工作的同志脱离了群众，不了解群众的情绪，不能够帮助群众组织生产，改善生活，只知道向他们要救国公粮，而不知道首先用百分之九十的精力去帮助群众解决他们‘救民私粮’的问题，然后仅仅用百分之十的精力就可以解决救国公粮的问题，那末，这就是沾染了国民党的作风，沾染了官僚主义的灰尘。”
    （“组织起来”）
    共产党员无论在什么时候，无论处理什么问题，一定要紧密地与群众相结合，要依靠群众，在经济工作上也一样。
    进行任何一项经济工作必须首先从当前客观经济环境出发，要使自己的思想符合于客观经济状况；要根据客观条件来制订自己的工作方针和计划，而不能根据自己的主观愿望来制订任何方针和计划。如果我们带着城市的观点来处理以个体经济为基础的农村问题，或不顾及已经改变了的客观情况，把抗日战争时期农村中小生产的工作方法带到现代化的产业部门里面来，就不能不在工作中发生错误，就不能不使工作的发展受到阻碍。
    当抗日战争还处在困难阶段时，毛泽东同志曾写道：“我们现在的困难，有的已经渡过，有的快要渡过。我们曾经历过比现在还要困难到多少倍的时候，那样的困难我们也渡过了。现在华北华中各根据地的困难，比陕甘宁边区要大得多，那里天天有严重的战争，那里已经支持了五年半，那里也一定能够继续支持，直到胜利。在我们面前是没有悲观的，我们能够战胜任何的困难。”（“抗日时期的经济问题和财政问题”）今天，曾经在毛泽东同志领导下渡过无数艰难的、战胜过许多强大敌人的中国人民，正在为建设一个新的工业化的中国而奋斗。虽然在我们面前仍然存在着一些困难，但只要我们紧紧地掌握住毛泽东同志的思想，遵循着他所指示的道路前进，我们就必将取得比过去更大的更辉煌的胜利。
