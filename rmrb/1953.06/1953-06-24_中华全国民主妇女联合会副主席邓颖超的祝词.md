Dear Delegates, Comrades, Guests:

    First, please allow me, with the most joyful feelings, to represent the All-China Democratic Women's Federation in extending warm congratulations to the Second National Congress of the China New Democratic Youth League.

    Under the leadership and cultivation of the great Chinese Communist Party and the great leader Comrade Mao Zedong, the China New Democratic Youth League has made great progress in its organization and improvements in its work over the past few years. Under the direct leadership of the Central Committee of the Youth League, it has trained and organized young men and women League members to diligently study Marxism-Leninism and the works of Mao Zedong, actively delve into professional work, learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, and well respond to every call of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government. In various social reform movements, in building the motherland, defending the motherland, and safeguarding world peace, they have stood at the forefront of the masses, creating excellent achievements and producing countless heroes and models, setting advanced examples for the vast number of young men and women across the country.

    We particularly emphasize that we hope the Youth League will show greater initiative in opposing feudal remnants of thought and customs; in particular, it must oppose feudal viewpoints that belittle, despise, and discriminate against women, and establish and strengthen the idea and education of equality between men and women. The Youth League's organizations at all levels should attach importance to and strengthen the work on young women, so that the new generation can show a new outlook in thought and action in this regard.

    We believe that this congress, after full democratic discussion, unfolding criticism and self-criticism, will certainly be able to formulate the Youth League's guiding principles and tasks during the period of national construction, push the Youth League's work and the youth movement to a newer stage, unite all Youth League members and the vast number of young men and women across the country, and work together to strive, with tireless study and selfless labor, to give full play to initiative and creativity, to gradually realize the country's industrialization, to gradually transition from New Democracy to a beautiful socialist society, to defend our great motherland, and to safeguard world peace.

    I wish the congress a successful conclusion! I wish all the delegates good health!

    中华全国民主妇女联合会副主席邓颖超的祝词亲爱的代表们，同志们，来宾们：
    首先请允许我以最喜悦的心情代表中华全国民主妇女联合会向中国新民主主义青年团第二次全国代表大会致以热烈的祝贺。
    中国新民主主义青年团在伟大的中国共产党和伟大的领袖毛泽东同志的领导与培养下，在过去几年中，在组织上有了很大的发展，在工作上也有着改进，在团中央直接领导下，训练着、组织着男女青年团员们努力学习马克思列宁主义、毛泽东的著作，积极地钻研业务，学习苏联的先进经验，很好地响应中国共产党和人民政府的每一个号召，在各种社会改革运动中，在建设祖国、保卫祖国、保卫世界和平方面，都站在群众的前列，创造了优良的成绩，出现了无数的英雄与模范，在全国广大男女青年中，树立了先进榜样。
    我们特别着重提出来，希望青年团在反对封建残余的思想和习俗方面，表现更大的积极性；特别要反对轻视、卑视、歧视妇女的封建观点，树立和加强男女平等的思想和教育。在青年团的各级组织中重视并加强对青年妇女的工作，在这方面，使新的一代在思想上、行动上表现出新的气象。
    我们相信：这次大会经过充分的民主的讨论，展开批评与自我批评，一定能够制定出国家建设时期的青年团的方针任务，把青年团的工作和青年运动推向更新的阶段，团结全体青年团员和全国广大男女青年们，共同一致地努力，以不懈的学习和忘我的劳动的精神，充分发挥积极性和创造性，为逐步地实现国家的工业化、为逐步地由新民主主义过渡到美好的社会主义社会、为保卫我们伟大的祖国、为保卫世界和平而努力奋斗。
    祝大会胜利成功！祝各位代表身体健康！
