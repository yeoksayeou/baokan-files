Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, May 31st (TASS): The Press Office of the Prime Minister of the German Democratic Republic announced that at a special meeting held on May 30, 1953, the Council of Ministers of the German Democratic Republic unanimously adopted a statement expressing its support for the decision of the Soviet Council of Ministers to abolish the Soviet Control Commission for Germany.

The statement said: "The decision of the Soviet Council of Ministers to abolish the Soviet Control Commission for Germany is entirely consistent with the national interests of the German people.

"The Council of Ministers of the German Democratic Republic, on behalf of the people of the German Democratic Republic and all German patriots, declares that in the past few years, the Soviet Control Commission for Germany, in accordance with the decisions of the Potsdam Conference, has provided great assistance to the peaceful construction efforts of the German people.

"The peaceful policy pursued by the Soviet government through the Soviet Control Commission for Germany has developed and deepened the friendship between our two peoples. The establishment of the position of Soviet High Commissioner for Germany in the German capital of Berlin means that the Soviet Union will continue to unswervingly implement a policy of peace and friendship towards Germany. According to the Potsdam Agreement, the purpose of this policy is to establish an independent, democratic, peace-loving, and unified Germany."

The statement also pointed out that the policy of Western countries is to deepen the division of Germany and force West Germany to accept the Bonn and Paris war treaties. The statement said: "This policy hinders the conclusion of a peace treaty and aims to maintain foreign military rule in West Germany indefinitely. The Bonn and Paris treaties revive Nazism, turning West Germany into a breeding ground for revenge-seeking German militarism. This not only violates the interests of the German people, but also the interests of all peace-loving people of all countries."

The statement then emphasized that the Council of Ministers of the German Democratic Republic bases its policy on the obligations and rights of the German people stipulated in the Potsdam Agreement. The statement also said: "The Council of Ministers of the German Democratic Republic believes that the decision of the Soviet Council of Ministers once again proves the Soviet people's deep trust in the democratic forces of the German people. The Council of Ministers of the German Democratic Republic supports the decision of the Soviet government and considers it an important contribution to the peaceful settlement of the German question and the consolidation of peace in Europe. The decision of the Soviet Council of Ministers is a source of encouragement for the patriotic movement in all of Germany striving for unity, democracy, and peace."

The statement finally called on all true patriots of Germany to raise the banner of national independence even higher and advance towards victory.

    德意志民主共和国部长会议发表声明
    拥护苏联取消对德管制委员会
    认为是对和平解决德国问题的重要贡献
    【新华社一日讯】据塔斯社柏林五月三十一日讯：德意志民主共和国总理新闻处宣布：德意志民主共和国部长会议在一九五三年五月三十日召开的一次特别会议上，一致通过了一个声明，表示拥护苏联部长会议关于取消苏联对德管制委员会的决定。
    声明说：“苏联部长会议关于取消苏联对德管制委员会的决定是和德国人民的民族利益完全一致的。
    “德意志民主共和国部长会议代表德意志民主共和国人民及所有德国爱国人士声明，在过去几年中，苏联对德管制委员会按照波茨坦会议的决定，曾对德国人民的和平建设事业给予了巨大的帮助。
    “苏联政府通过苏联对德管制委员会所奉行的和平政策发展了并加深了我们两国人民之间的友谊。苏联在德国首都柏林设置驻德高级专员这个职位意味着，苏联将继续坚持不渝地对德国实行和平与友好政策。按照波茨坦协定，这个政策的目的在于建立一个独立的、民主的、爱好和平的与统一的德国。”
    声明同时指出：西方国家的政策却是加深德国的分裂并强使西德接受波恩及巴黎战争条约。声明说：“这种政策阻挠着和约的缔结，其目的在于无限期地维持外国在西德的军事统治。波恩及巴黎条约使纳粹主义复活，它们把西德变为渴望复仇的德国军国主义的温床。这不仅违背德国人民的利益，而且也违背一切国家爱好和平的人民的利益。”
    声明接着强调：德意志民主共和国部长会议以波茨坦协定所规定的德国人民的义务与权利作为它的政策的基础。声明并说：“德意志民主共和国部长会议认为，苏联部长会议的决定再一次证明了，苏联人民深深地信任德国人民的民主力量。德意志民主共和国部长会议拥护苏联政府的决定，认为这是对于和平解决德国问题及巩固欧洲和平的重要贡献。苏联部长会议的决定是对于全德国争取统一、民主与和平的爱国运动的一种鼓舞的泉源。”
    声明最后号召德国所有真正的爱国人士，更高地举起民族独立的旗帜，向胜利前进。
