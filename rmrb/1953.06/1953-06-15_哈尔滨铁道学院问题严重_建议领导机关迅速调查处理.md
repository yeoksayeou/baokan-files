    Serious Problems at Harbin Railway Institute
    Suggest Leadership Organs Conduct Prompt Investigation and Handling
    Editor's Note: We have recently received twelve letters from students and teachers at Harbin Railway Institute, reflecting many serious problems in the school's department adjustments, teaching work, and political leadership. We now select several representative letter abstracts for publication below, requesting the Central Railway Ministry and the Higher Education Ministry to promptly investigate and handle them.
    (I)
    A joint letter from students of Harbin Railway Institute: The phenomenon of returning to classes and repeating courses at our institute is very serious. Some courses have been retaken three or four times without being mastered. This is caused by the school leadership's subjectivism and rash implementation of new teaching systems. Last year, the Central Government sent a group of worker-peasant cadres to our institute to study. The institute did not consider whether their educational level was suitable, but, under the pretext of "the motherland's needs," forced them to study signaling. Two months later, it was discovered that their level was indeed too low, and they were withdrawn from the original class and formed into Signaling Class B. At the time, teachers had suggested that these worker-peasant cadres should first receive remedial basic courses to avoid future difficulties, but the leadership did not consider this and still required them to study according to the regular university schedule. As a result, the difficulties became greater and greater, and finally, they had to stop taking all university professional courses. This year was wasted. A similar situation also occurred in the current Signaling Grade Two, Classes A and B. These students have now completed two years of university, but the learning effect is very poor. Some courses have been taken twice, but now they have to start again with the first-year courses. Students have a lot of complaints about this situation, but the institute does not start by examining the leadership and improving teaching work. Instead, it believes that the students have problems with study discipline and learning attitudes, and thus conducts large reports, requiring students to make self-criticisms. In fact, the students are working very hard. Generally, students spend 30% more time studying each week than the State Council stipulates (no more than 54 hours of study per week). Some students even spend 74 hours. On Saturday evenings, they have to rush to class until about 11 o'clock, and they cannot rest on Sundays.
    When students wanted to report the above situation to the Central Government, they were restricted and threatened by the institute. At the end of last year, Minister Teng Daiyuan came to our institute to give a report. The school leadership arranged: "It is forbidden to report opinions to Minister Teng." Recently, the Central Railway Ministry sent a comrade to our institute to understand the situation. The school leadership was frantically organizing many ostentatious committees, such as the Health Committee, the Literary and Sports Activities Promotion Committee, the Patriotic Movement Committee, the Food Management Committee, etc. All the chairmen were the president and the head of general affairs. On the one hand, they said to this comrade: "Students in a certain department and a certain class are the most mischievous and have always lagged behind," attempting to confuse this comrade's vision. When the masses learned that someone had been sent by the Central Government, many professors, assistant teachers, and students wanted to find this comrade to report the situation. The school leadership was very afraid of this. The deputy secretary of the Party general branch and several other cadres moved into the room directly opposite the comrade's room to monitor the people who went to talk to him. After probationary Party member Huang Jiuyan and two others talked several times, they immediately received a warning from the Party group leader:
    "You should pay attention to your probationary period!" Frightened, they did not dare to offer any opinions. Recently, the Higher Education Ministry sent a letter soliciting opinions on the adjustment of departments last year. The school leadership did not seriously organize discussions, but only perfunctorily consulted the directors of the teaching and research sections by circulating notes. When the teachers learned of this, they automatically held meetings by teaching and research section, collected opinions, and signed their names on the report to the Central Government to show responsibility. The school authorities were very dissatisfied with this, and through the organization, blamed the League members, saying: "Signing is the way to treat the enemy." This phenomenon of suppressing democracy is very common in our institute. We hope that the Central Railway Ministry and the Higher Education Ministry will pay attention to the above situation and promptly investigate and handle it.
    (II)
    A joint letter from eight teachers and three students of Harbin Railway Institute: Last year, our institute was adjusted into an independent institute specializing in telecommunications and signaling. However, whether our institute should become an independent institute is a matter that we suggest the Central Higher Education Ministry and the Railway Ministry should reconsider. The actual situation now is this: since the adjustment of departments, because our institute lacks teachers for basic courses, some courses have to be taught by professional teachers, which weakens the teaching work of professional courses. Secondly, the lack of equipment in our institute is also very serious. It cannot meet the needs of teaching and affects the teaching effect.
    According to the central government's instructions to put businesses with similar natures and close relationships together for adjustment, we suggest that our institute and Tangshan Railway Institute be merged together. Because the professional courses of the two institutes are very similar, many facilities of the two institutes can be used uniformly, and the problem of teacher shortage can also be solved. We hope that the central leading organs will make reasonable adjustments.

### 哈尔滨铁道学院问题严重  建议领导机关迅速调查处理

专栏：读者来信摘要

    哈尔滨铁道学院问题严重
    建议领导机关迅速调查处理
    编者按：我们最近收到十二封哈尔滨铁道学院学生和教师的来信，反映该校在院系调整、教学工作和政治领导等方面存在许多严重问题。现在选择几封有代表性的来信摘要发表在下面，请中央铁道部和高等教育部迅速调查处理。
    （一）
    哈尔滨铁道学院同学联名来信：我院返课重修的现象很严重，有的课程返课三、四次仍然没有学好，这是因为学校领导方面的主观主义和冒然实行新教学制度而造成的。去年，中央派了一批工农干部到我院学习，院方不考虑他们的文化程度是否适合，而借口“祖国需要”，强迫他们学信号。两个月后，发现他们程度的确太差，才把他们从原班抽出，编成信号乙班。当时，教师曾提出意见，建议先给这批工农干部补习基础课程，以免日后再发生困难；但领导方面不加考虑，仍要他们按正规大学的进度学习。结果困难越来越大，终于不得不在最近停修所有大学专业课程，这一年的时间就浪费了。类似情况也发生在现在的信号二年级甲乙两班。这批同学现在已读完两年大学了，但学习效果很差，有些课程虽然已读过两遍，现在仍然不得不重新从一年级的课程读起。同学们对这种情况很有意见，但院方并不从检查领导和改进教学工作着手，反而认为同学学习纪律和学习观点有问题，于是进行大报告，要学生作检讨。实际上同学的学习很努力，一般同学每周的学习时间都超过了政务院规定时间
    （每周学习不得超过五十四小时）的百分之三十，有的同学竟达七十四小时，星期六晚上要赶课到十一时左右，星期日也不得休息。
    同学们要把以上情况反映给中央，却又遭到院方的限制和威胁。去年年底滕代远部长到我院来作报告，学校领导即布置：“不准向滕部长反映意见”。最近中央铁道部派了一个同志来本院了解情况，学校领导方面一面手忙脚乱地组织了许多名目堂皇的委员会，如健康委员会、文娱体育活动促进委员会、爱国运动委员会、伙食管理委员会等，所有的主任委员都由院长、总务长担任；一面又对这个同志说：“某系某班的同学最调皮、最捣蛋，一贯落后”， 企图迷惑这位同志的视听。当群众知道中央派人来了之后，许多教授、助教和同学们都要找这个同志反映情况，学校领导因此十分恐惧，党总支副书记和其他几个干部就搬入正对着这位同志住房的房间，注意监视去谈话的人。候补党员黄九琰等三人去谈了几次之后，马上得到党小组长的警告：
    “你们应该注意你们的候补期！”吓得他们也就不敢提意见了。最近高等教育部来函，征求对去年调整院系的意见。学校领导方面并没有认真组织讨论，仅只草草了事地以纸条传阅的方式，向教研室主任征求了一下意见。教师们知道了，自动以教研室为单位开会，收集了意见，并在给中央的报告上签了名，以示负责。学校当局因而很不满意，通过组织责备团员说：“签名是对待敌人的办法”。这种压制民主的现象在我院是很普遍的。希望中央铁道部和高等教育部重视以上情况并迅速调查处理。
    （二）
    哈尔滨铁道学院八位教师和三位学生分别联名来信：去年我院经过院系调整，改为电信信号专业的独立学院；但我院应否成为独立学院，建议中央高等教育部和铁道部再行考虑。现在的实际情况是这样：自从院系调整之后，由于本院基础课程的师资缺乏，有些课程不得不请专业教师担任，这就减弱了专业课程的教学工作。其次，我院设备不足的情况也很严重，不能适应教学的需要，影响了教学效果。
    根据中央所指示的，将性质相近、关系密切的业务放在一起的调整原则，我们建议将我院和唐山铁道学院合办在一起。因为两院的专业课很相近，而该院许多设备可统一利用，师资缺乏的问题也可解决。希望中央领导机关再作合理调整。
