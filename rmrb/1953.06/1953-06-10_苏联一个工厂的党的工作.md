    Party Work in a Soviet Factory
    By Our Correspondent in Moscow  Li He
    (Continued from yesterday)
    Supervising Administrative Work
    If the role of the Party grassroots organization in Soviet institutions lies in "pointing out the shortcomings of the work of the institution and the individual staff, and sending their materials and views to the appropriate Party organs and institutional leaders" (Pravda), then the Party grassroots organization in Soviet industrial enterprises, according to the Constitution of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, has the right to supervise the work of the administration, that is, to help the administration complete the production plan with its own political and organizational work. This is clearly demonstrated in the activities of the "Moskvich" automobile factory Party organization mentioned above and below.
    The "Moskvich" automobile factory Party organization regularly pays attention to the selection of administrative leaders, because cadres determine the success or failure of the work. In 1950, when preparing to overcome shortcomings in production, the factory management, on the proposal of the factory Party committee, strengthened the responsible cadres in many workshops and promoted a group of competent technical cadres to leadership positions. After that, the work in the workshops improved. Under the supervision and education of the Party, the ability of the factory's administrative cadres has been strengthened and improved in recent years. At the factory Party activists' meetings, cadre work is often discussed and criticized.
    The factory Party committee, the workshop Party branch committees, and the workshop Party meetings regularly listen to and discuss reports from administrative cadres on production, technology, and economic issues in order to supervise the completion of production tasks. For example: When the factory management formulated the complex task of extending the life of automobiles in 1952, the Party organization paid attention to urging the completion of this task. The factory Party committee listened to reports from two Party members—the chief engineer and the chief designer. When they expressed that the renovation of automobiles could not be carried out quickly, the Party committee criticized them, instructing them to better arrange their work and accelerate the renovation. The decision of the Party committee was taken to the Party branch meetings of the General Engineering Department and the General Design Department for discussion. The Party branch committees mobilized the enthusiasm of the technical personnel, organized competitions, supervised the progress of this matter, and discussed the issue several times. As a result, the task of extending the "Moskvich" automobile's mileage to 60,000 kilometers without major repairs was achieved. As another example: The No. 1 carriage workshop fell behind in the competition, and the products had problems, which affected the normal work of other departments. The factory Party committee organized a committee, with the participation of Communist Party members—some workshop directors and department directors, Party branch secretaries, Party group leaders, technical personnel, and advanced workers. They thoroughly understood the production situation, Party and mass work in this workshop, and talked to people. The committee clarified that the fundamental shortcomings lay in: failing to publicize the results of the competition, failing to initiate discussions when there were defective products, failing to evaluate the quality of certain operations, and neglecting the technical training of workers and the introduction of advanced workers' experience. The committee instructed the workshop Party branch to overcome these shortcomings. After some time, the factory Party committee listened to the report of the workshop director again. Before this, the actual situation of this workshop was also investigated. The Party committee pointed out that the Party, the administration, and the trade union of the workshop had made achievements in improving production, but the struggle against the defects in the assembly of carriages was not enough. According to the requirements of the Party committee, a board for publicizing defective products was erected in the workshop. The Communist Party members of the workshop intensified their propaganda and explanation work, attracting all workers to the competition of "completing each operation with excellent quality." Later, this workshop became a workshop for collective Stakhanovite labor and the production of excellent quality products.
    The factory Party committee regularly held Party activists' meetings. In 1952, eight such meetings were held. The meetings discussed important issues in production, such as improving quality, reducing defective products, working rhythmically, and so on. The meetings unfolded criticism and self-criticism from below. The Party committee paid attention to ensuring that the factory leadership considered and accepted these criticisms.
    The factory Party organization strived to absorb as many Party members and masses as possible to participate in the supervision of administrative work, concentrating their wisdom to improve the work of all links in the factory. The reports of the administration were discussed at Party meetings, workers' meetings, and production meetings; the masses were mobilized to participate in supervision by means of social inspections of production and other methods; and the employees were educated with an uncompromising attitude towards shortcomings and a spirit of responsibility for the factory.
    This is how the "Moskvich" automobile factory Party organization used various positive methods to supervise the administrative work of the Party.
    Giving Play to the Role of Party Grassroots Organizations and Party Members
    In guaranteeing and supervising the completion of production tasks, the workshop Party branches and Party groups, which are closest to production, play an important role. The Party organizations of each workshop of the "Moskvich" automobile factory are like this.
    The Party branch of the automatic machinery workshop is good at using political work to strengthen production. In the spring of 1952, violations of labor discipline occurred in the workshop. The Party branch meeting discussed this issue. The meeting listened to the report of the workshop director and the criticisms of Party members. After the meeting, the workshop strengthened mass political work, especially among young workers. Every violation of labor discipline was taken to the Party group meeting for discussion, and after the discussion, the workshop director gave administrative punishment to the violators. As a result, violations of labor discipline were greatly reduced.
    The current distribution team of the electroplating workshop had strived to become a Stakhanovite team and a high-quality team. The Party group of the team paid attention to the realization of this goal. Communist Party members—advanced workers—introduced their experiences to everyone. Communist Party members—propagandists—conducted mobilization work among the workers. Communist Party members helped new workers and organized Stakhanovite schools. The Party group mobilized people to put forward 42 rationalization proposals in a short period of time. The Party group struggled against abnormal phenomena that hindered production. Finally, the employees of the current distribution team realized their goals.
    The factory Party committee is concerned about improving the level of the staff of the Party grassroots organizations. The factory has 28 workshop branches and 98 Party groups. The branch secretaries, branch committee members, and group leaders all participate in the district Party school, the Marxism-Leninism night university, or the study group. Every Monday, the secretaries of the Party branches of each workshop meet at the Party committee. There, they listen to reports on group work and political work, exchange experiences, and receive work instructions. The Party group leaders are released from production for three days each year for training. The factory Party committee and the workshop Party branch committees also regularly convene Party group leaders to exchange experiences. The Party committee regularly listens to the work reports of the workshop Party branches and Party groups, criticizing and helping them to overcome shortcomings, and educating them to give play to their creativity and rely on Party members to carry out their work.
    According to the Constitution of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the "Moskvich" automobile factory Party organization requires Party members to play an exemplary leading role in production.
    There are 80 Party members in the molding workshop. There are Party members in every work section, and they have a positive influence on non-Party members. There are 28 production teams in the workshop. The production team led by Party member G. Charov was the first to become a high-quality production team. He introduced his experience to each production team. By October 1952, there were already 20 high-quality production teams in this workshop, and in November, there were eight high-quality work sections. Six of the eight work section foremen were Communist Party members.
    Many of the Communist Party members in the factory are production innovators and rationalization proposers. The production team leader, V. Ustinkin, and four other Party members won the Stalin Prize for participating in the establishment of a new-style wrought iron workshop. The Party member turner, Nikolaev, initiated the efficient use of 480 minutes of each working day. Alternate Party member N. Yudaev proposed a competition to eliminate losses in each production operation. Party member turner V. Shalychev and fitter P. Romanov initiated a campaign to extend the service life of tools and parts.
    The workshop Party branches and groups educate Communist Party members in their daily practical work, so that each of them meets the requirements of the Party Constitution. A worker in a production team in the molding workshop violated labor discipline. The Party branch strictly criticized the team leader—an alternate Party member—although he himself was not the violator, but he tolerated this backward phenomenon.
    The Party organization of the "Moskvich" automobile factory thus guarantees the completion of production tasks through its grassroots and members.
    Actively Promoting Advanced Experience
    In guaranteeing the completion of production tasks, the "Moskvich" automobile factory Party organization constantly and extensively disseminates the advanced experiences of its own enterprise and other enterprises as quickly as possible. The Party organization pays particular attention to promoting the initiatives of the most important production innovators, such as the Kovalev method, reducing costs in each operation, completing each operation with excellent quality, reducing the consumption of metal in each product, and so on. 68 percent of the factory's piece-rate workers participated in the competition to reduce costs in each operation in January of this year. By the end of last year, more than 2,000 workers in the factory had participated in the competition to complete each operation with excellent quality. Last year, the factory organized 32 joint teams to study reducing metal consumption; the joint team in the preparation workshop helped this workshop save 80 tons of metal in 1952.
    A group of workers from the factory visited the Lyublino iron casting and machining factory to learn about the experience of "completing each operation with excellent quality." Before promoting this experience, the Party committee of the automatic machinery workshop and the administration jointly convened the leaders of each production team and adjustment hands, asking them to study methods to enable each worker to complete each operation with excellent quality. Based on the opinions raised by everyone to overcome certain obstacles in equipment and technology, a plan was formulated to guarantee excellent work in organization and technology. The workers were explained the working methods of the innovators. Propagandists conducted talks. Workers were organized to study the technical procedures necessary for completing each operation with excellent quality. Some lectures were organized by technical personnel. A group of Communist Party members took the lead in participating in this competition. Inspectors judged the quality of the products every day, and these judgments were widely announced on the competition bulletin board and in the propagandists' talks.
    Yudaev, an assembler in the factory's second carriage workshop, proposed a suggestion to eliminate losses in each operation. He said: "The meaning of my suggestion is very simple—strictly and with a master's attitude cherish parts and materials, and first of all, treat the things you accept honestly and with a communist attitude." The factory Party committee supported his suggestion. The Party committee of the carriage workshop twice discussed the notices of the planning and scheduling department and the planning and economic department, helping to strictly calculate the parts that must be consumed. Communist Party members explained the importance of saving to the workers and posted charts showing the value of each, even the smallest, part. Party groups paid attention to educating workers in each section and each work section to cherish materials and parts with a master's attitude at all times.
    Systematic Propaganda and Education
    In guaranteeing the completion of production tasks, the "Moskvich" automobile factory Party organization attaches importance to the propaganda and education of employees. Because propaganda and education are unfailing and powerful levers to improve the political awareness, creative initiative, and cultural and technical level of employees.
    The Party organization's powerful assistant in carrying out political work among the masses is the propagandist (literally translated as agitator). There are about 900 propagandists in the entire factory. Most of them work among the workers in the workshops, and a small part works among the residents. Each workshop's propagandists form a propaganda team, led by the workshop Party branch secretary. The factory Party committee and the workshop Party branch committee are concerned about improving the propagandists' political and cultural level and propaganda skills. Lectures are organized for propagandists. The Party branch committees of workshops and departments hold propagandist meetings at least twice a month, where propagandists listen to instructive reports and exchange work experience. The administrative heads of workshops and departments also participate in guiding the propagandists. Propagandists keep diaries, recording the dates, topics, number of listeners, and most interesting questions and opinions of the talks. These diaries are printed and distributed to propagandists and Party branch secretaries and group leaders for reference. The factory Party committee formulates topics for propagandist talks every month, including major domestic and foreign political events and the factory's current tasks, but the central task of the propagandists is to attract the workers' attention to the factory's basic tasks and encourage their production enthusiasm. Propagandists have great initiative: they can talk about topics outside the plan when they deem it necessary. Most propagandists work in their own work sections, and all propagandists conduct propaganda for fixed production teams, so they are familiar with the needs of their objects. Propagandists are familiar with people and familiar with production, which is a necessary condition for doing a good job in propaganda. In addition to conducting talks with collective workers, propagandists also conduct talks with individual workers from time to time. The propagandists' talks are usually conducted in the workshop, next to the work place; in this way, the advantages or disadvantages of someone's work can be specifically cited during the talk. Propagandists also cite examples from literary books in their talks. Propagandists not only carry out oral propaganda, but also set an example for workers with their own actions. Most of the propagandists in the factory are model workers. With the help of the active work of the propagandists, the "Moskvich" automobile factory produced several million rubles worth of products exceeding the plan in 1952, reduced metal and electricity consumption, and improved labor productivity.
    The Party organization also uses various effective propaganda weapons. Many vivid slogans and propaganda paintings are hung in the factory. Quick reports reporting the workers' achievements and shortcomings are regularly posted in each workshop. The factory publishes printed tabloids, and each workshop and department publishes wall newspapers, with satirical versions exposing shortcomings. They are all under the leadership of the factory's Party organizations at all levels.
    The factory Party organization regards educating employees as its primary task. In terms of improving the political knowledge of employees, the factory has a Party education network. The number of employees participating in learning there has increased by one and a half times in the past two years. In the 1952-53 academic year, 90 political study classes and groups were opened in each workshop and department. Young employees who have just come to the factory participate in political study classes and groups to study the Soviet social and state system; more cultured employees study Party history and study the original works, philosophy, and political economy of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin. Hundreds of Communist Party members are studying Marxism-Leninism theory on their own. Many are studying at the district Party school and the Marxism-Leninism night university. At the beginning of this year, the entire Party education network studied Stalin's "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR" and speeches at the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and the documents of the 19th Congress. All Communist Party members and hundreds of non-Party members are studying in the Party education network.
    The factory's technical education is also very extensive. There are dozens of Stakhanovite schools in each workshop where advanced workers teach their experiences. There is also the obligation of old hands to help new ones, evenings for exchanging experiences, and speeches by production innovators. Hundreds of workers are studying professional knowledge and new technologies in various technical training courses. In the 1952-53 academic year, four batches of foremen improved their technical level in the foreman training class. About 300 people are studying at the factory's affiliated automatic machinery technical school without leaving production. Young workers who have not completed secondary education are studying at the youth worker night school. More than 100 employees have entered night universities and will become workshop engineers after graduation. Technical personnel who have received specialized education are also studying new things in science and technology. Almost all employees in each workshop are involved in the wave of technical learning. The Party branch and administrative responsible persons in the workshop also participate in learning as an example. In 1952, the factory's technical education plan was completed by 250 percent in nine months. The Party organization regularly checks the technical learning situation, paying attention to linking technical learning with production work.
    This is how the Party organization of the "Moskvich" automobile factory supports the administration from all aspects of political work and organizational work to ensure the completion of the glorious tasks entrusted by the Party and the state. (The End)

    苏联一个工厂的党的工作
    本报驻莫斯科特派记者  李何
    （续昨）
    监督行政工作
    如果说苏联机关中党基层组织的作用在于“指出机关工作以及机关的个别工作人员的缺点，把自己的材料和看法送给适当的党的机构和机关领导人”
    （真理报），那么苏联工业企业中党基层组织，根据苏联共产党党章，却有权监督行政的工作，也就是说，以自己的政治工作和组织工作来帮助行政完成生产计划。这在上述和下述“莫斯科人”汽车工厂党组织的活动中表现得很清楚。
    “莫斯科人”汽车工厂党组织经常注意行政领导干部的选拔，因为干部决定着工作的成败。在一九五零年准备克服生产中的缺点的时候，工厂管理部根据工厂党委会的提议，加强了许多车间的负责干部，提拔了一批胜任的技术干部到领导岗位上去。在这以后，车间工作好转了。在党的监督和教育下，工厂行政干部的能力最近几年加强和提高了。在工厂党的积极分子会议上时常讨论和批评干部工作。
    工厂党委会、车间党支委会和车间党的会议经常听取和讨论行政干部关于生产、技术和经济问题的报告，以便监督完成生产任务。例如：工厂管理部在一九五二年制订了延长汽车寿命的复杂任务时，党组织注意了督促完成这个任务。工厂党委会听取了两个党员——总技师和总设计师的报告。当他们表示汽车的革新不能很快进行时，党委会批评他们，责成他们更好地安排工作，加速革新。党委会的决定拿到总技师部和总设计师部党支部会议上去讨论。党支委会发动了技术人员的积极性，组织了竞赛，监督这个事情的进行，几次讨论这个问题。结果，实现了“莫斯科人”汽车不要大修理延长行程到六万公里的任务。又如：第一号车厢车间在竞赛中落后了，产品有毛病，影响了其他部门的正常工作。工厂党委会组织了委员会，参加的有共产党员们——一些车间主任和部主任、党支部书记、党小组长、技术人员、先进工人。他们详细地了解了这个车间的生产情况、党和群众工作，找人们谈话。委员会弄清了根本的缺点在于：不注意公布竞赛的结果，有废品不发动大家讨论，不评判某些操作的质量，忽视工人的技术训练和先进工人经验的介绍。委员会责成车间党支部克服这些缺点。过些时候，工厂党委会再听取了车间主任的报告。在这之前，同样先了解了这个车间的实际情况。党委会指出了车间党、行政、工会对于改进生产有成绩，但对于装配车厢中的毛病的斗争还不够。根据党委会的要求，车间立起了废品公布牌。车间的共产党员们加紧了宣传和解释工作，把所有工人都吸引到了“优等地完成每一个操作”竞赛中去。后来这个车间成为集体斯大哈诺夫式劳动和出产优等质量产品的车间。
    工厂党委会定期地召开党的积极分子会议。一九五二年举行了八次这种会议。会议讨论了生产中的重要问题，如提高质量、减少废品、有节奏地工作等等。会议展开了从下面来的批评和自我批评。党委会注意使工厂领导方面考虑和接受这些批评。
    工厂党组织努力吸收尽量多的党员和群众参加对行政工作的监督，集中他们的智慧来改善工厂各环节的工作。在党的会议、工人会议、生产会议上讨论行政的报告；用社会检查生产情况等等方式，发动群众参加监督；以对缺点采取不调和的态度和对工厂负责的精神，教育职工。
    “莫斯科人”汽车工厂党组织就是这样运用着多种积极的方式，进行党对行政工作的监督。
    发挥党基层组织和党员的作用
    在保证和监督生产任务的完成中，最接近生产的车间党支部和党小组起着重要的作用。“莫斯科人”汽车工厂各车间的党组织就是如此。
    自动机械车间党支部善于运用政治工作来加强生产。一九五二年春天在车间曾发生违反劳动纪律的事情。党支部会议讨论了这个问题。会议听取了车间主任的报告和党员的批评。会后，车间加强了群众政治工作，特别是在青年工人中。每件违反劳动纪律的事情都拿到党小组会去讨论，讨论后，车间主任给违反者以行政处分。结果，违反劳动纪律的事情大大减少了。
    电镀车间的电流分间曾经先后争取成为斯大哈诺夫式分间和优等质量分间。分间党小组注意这个目标的实现。共产党员——先进工人把自己经验介绍给全体。共产党员——宣传员向工人们进行鼓动工作。共产党员帮助了新来工人，组织了斯大哈诺夫学校。党小组发动了人们在短期内提出了四十二件合理化建议。党小组跟阻碍生产的不正常现象作了斗争。终于，电流分间职工实现了自己的目标。
    工厂党委会关心提高党基层组织工作人员的水平。工厂有二十八个车间支部和九十八个党小组。支部书记、支部委员和小组长都参加区党校、马列主义夜间大学或研究小组学习。每星期一，各车间党支部书记在党委会开会。他们在那里听取组工作和政治工作报告，交换经验，接受工作的指示。党小组长每年有三天脱离生产受训。工厂党委会和车间党支委会还定期召集党小组长交换经验。党委会经常听取车间党支部和党小组的工作报告，批评和帮助他们克服缺点，教育他们发挥创造性和依靠党员进行工作。
    根据苏联共产党党章，“莫斯科人”汽车工厂党组织要求党员在生产中起着模范的带头的作用。
    在制型车间有八十个党员。每一个工段都有党员，他们给非党员积极的影响。车间有二十八个生产组。由党员格·查罗夫领导的生产组，首先成为优等质量生产组。他把经验介绍给各个生产组。到
    一九五二年十月，这个车间内，成为优等质量生产组的已经有二十个，十一月成为优等质量工段的有八个，八个工段的领班中六个是共产党员。
    工厂里的共产党员很多是生产革新者、合理化建议者。生产组组长维·乌斯丁金等四位党员因为参加设立新式锻铁车间而获得斯大林奖金。党员镟工尼古拉也夫倡议了高效率地利用每个工作日的四百
    八十分钟。候补党员尼·尤达也夫提出了消灭每个生产操作上的损失的竞赛。党员镟工维·沙雷契夫和钳工甫·罗玛诺夫发起了延长工具和零件使用期限的运动。
    车间党支部和小组在日常实际工作中教育共产党员，使他们每个人都要合乎党章的要求。制型车间有一个生产组的工人违反了劳动纪律，党支部严格地批评这一组组长——候补党员，虽然他自己不是违反者，但是他容忍了这种落后现象。
    “莫斯科人”汽车工厂的党组织就是这样通过自己的基层和成员来保证生产任务的完成的。
    积极推广先进经验
    在保证生产任务的完成中，“莫斯科人”汽车工厂党组织时时刻刻尽快尽广地普及本企业和其他企业的先进经验。党组织尤其注意推广那些最重要的生产革新者的创举，如郭瓦廖夫方法、在每个操作上减低成本、优等地完成每个操作、在每个产品上减少金属的消耗等等。工厂领计件工资的工人，参加在每个操作上减低成本竞赛的，在今年一月有百分之六十八。工厂参加优等地完成每个操作竞赛的工人，到去年年底，已经有二千多人。在去年工厂组织有三十二个研究减低金属消耗的联合组；预备车间的联合组帮助这个车间在一九五二年节约了八十吨金属。
    工厂有一批工人到了留布林诺鎔铸和机械加工工厂参观“优等地完成每个操作”的经验。在推广这个经验前，自动机械车间党支委和行政一起召集了各生产组组长和调整手，要求他们研究使每个工人优等地完成每个操作的办法。根据大家所提的克服装备和技术上的某些阻碍的意见，制订了在组织和技术上保证优等地工作的计划。向工人们讲解了创举人的工作方法。宣传员进行了谈话。组织工人研究了为优等地完成每个操作所必需的技术手续。组织技术人员做了一些讲演。由一批共产党员带头参加了这个竞赛。检查员每天评判了产品的质量，这些评判在竞赛布告牌上和宣传员谈话中广为宣布。
    工厂的第二车厢车间装配工尤达也夫提出了消灭每个操作上的损失的建议。他说：“我的建议的意思很简单——严格地、以主人公的态度爱惜零件和材料，而首先是忠诚地、以共产主义的态度对待所接受的事情。”工厂党委会支持了他的建议。车厢车间党支委两次讨论了计划调度处和计划经济处的通知，帮助严格地计算必需消耗的零件。共产党员们向工人们解释了节约的重要意义，张挂了每个甚至最小的零件的价值图表。党小组随时注意教育各分间和各工段工人以主人公态度爱惜材料和零件。
    有系统地宣传和教育
    在保证生产任务的完成中，“莫斯科人”汽车工厂党组织重视对职工的宣传和教育。因为宣传和教育是百试不爽的有力的杠杆，用以提高职工的政治觉悟、创造积极性和文化技术水平。
    工厂党组织对群众进行政治工作的有力助手是宣传员（直译为鼓动员）。全厂约有九百个宣传员。他们大半在车间工人中进行工作，小半在居民中进行工作。每个车间的宣传员组成一个宣传队，由车间党支部书记领导。工厂党委会和车间党支委关心提高宣传员的政治和文化水平和宣传技巧。为宣传员组织讲演。车间和部的党支委会每月起码召开两次宣传员会议，宣传员在会上听取指示性报告和交换工作经验。车间和部的行政负责人也参加对宣传员的指导。宣传员都写日记，记下谈话的日期、题目、听众数目、最有兴趣的问题和意见。这些日记印发给宣传员和党支部书记和小组长参考。工厂党委会每月制订宣传员谈话的题目，包括国内外重大政治事件和工厂当前任务，但宣传员的中心工作在于吸引工人们注意工厂的基本任务，鼓舞他们的生产热情。宣传员有很大主动性：他们认为必要时可以谈计划以外的题目。大部分宣传员在自己的工段工作，所有宣传员对固定的生产组进行宣传，所以他们都熟悉自己对象的需要。宣传员熟悉人们、熟悉生产，是做好宣传工作的必要条件。宣传员除了进行和集体的工人谈话以外，也时常和个别工人进行谈话。宣传员的谈话，平常在车间内，在工作地点旁边进行；这样在谈话时可以具体地举出某人工作的优点或缺点。宣传员在谈话时也援引文学书籍中的例子。宣传员不仅作口头宣传，而且以自己的行动为工人们的表率。工厂的大多数宣传员是模范工作者。在宣传员积极工作的帮助下，“莫斯科人”汽车工厂在一九五二年超计划出产了几百万卢布的产品，减低了金属和电力消耗额，提高了劳动生产率。
    党组织也使用着各种有效的宣传武器。工厂里挂着许多生动的标语和宣传画。各车间经常贴出报道工人的成绩和缺点的快报。工厂出版着铅印小报，各车间和各部出版着壁报，壁报上附有揭发缺点的讽刺版。它们都受着工厂各级党组织的领导。
    工厂党组织把教育职工看作自己的首要任务。在提高职工的政治知识方面，工厂设有党的教育网。最近两年参加那里学习的职工增长了一倍半。在一九五二—五三学年，各车间各部开设着九十个政治学习班和小组。才来工厂的年青职工参加政治学习班、小组，学习苏联社会和国家制度；较有修养的职工研究党史，研究马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的原著、哲学、政治经济学。几百个共产党员自修着马列主义理论。许多在区党校和马列主义夜间大学学习。今年年初，整个党的教育网都学习斯大林的“苏联社会主义经济问题”和在苏联共产党第十九次代表大会上的演说，和第十九次代表大会的文件。所有共产党员和几百个非党员都在党的教育网学习。
    工厂的技术教育也非常广泛。各车间里共有几十个由先进工人传授经验的斯大哈诺夫学校。还有老手对新手的义务帮助，交流经验的晚会，生产革新者的讲话。几百个工人在各种技术训练班学习业务知识和新技术。在一九五二—五三学年，有四批领班在领班训练班提高自己技术水平。约三百个人不脱离生产地在工厂附设的自动机械技术学校进修。没有受完中等教育的青年工人们在青工夜校学习。一百多个职工进了夜间高等学校，毕业后将成为车间工程师。受过专门教育的技术人员，也研究着科学和技术上的新事物。各车间所有职工几乎全都投入技术学习的浪潮中。车间的党支部和行政负责人员也以身作则地参加学习。一九五二年工厂的技术教育计划在九个月中就完成了百分之二百五十。党组织经常检查技术学习的情形，注意使技术学习与生产工作联系起来。
    “莫斯科人”汽车工厂党组织就是这样从政治工作和组织工作的各个方面，来支持行政，来保证党和国家所托付的光荣任务的完成。（完）
