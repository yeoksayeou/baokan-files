    CCP Zhaoyuan County Committee Examines Problems in Leading Spring Plowing, Decides to Further Strengthen Policy and Ideological Leadership, Improve Working Methods
    The CCP Zhaoyuan County Committee convened a meeting of the first and second secretaries of various districts in early May to examine and summarize the leadership problems in spring plowing and sowing, and to arrange the next step of work.
    During this year's spring plowing and sowing season, in order to continue tapping production potential on the basis of implementing new farming methods last year, and to break the ideological concerns of most people who feared that implementing new farming methods would be labor-intensive and that there would not be enough labor, the Zhaoyuan County Committee first went deep into Mengkeli Village to discuss with the masses, adopted methods such as "staggered planting," "five-sided operation" (see "Inexhaustible Potential" for details), and "full mobilization of women for one-time seedling setting" to achieve equidistant wide sowing and labor-saving thinning. After these methods were tested in Mengkeli Village with significant results, the Zhaoyuan County Committee immediately organized and promoted them in a specific way, and implemented the leadership method of "one point, multiple surfaces, and continuous visits," further promoting new farming methods in spring plowing production.
    According to the spirit of the central government's documents on rural work, there are still some problems in Zhaoyuan County's rural work. The leading cadres of various districts do not have a clear enough understanding of the agricultural production mutual aid and cooperation policy and the Party's overall policy on rural work, and their policy and ideological level is not high. For example, they lack a correct understanding of issues such as assisting poor farmers, uniting and educating individual farmers, and strengthening leadership in areas with weak work foundations and low-level mutual aid teams. Therefore, deviations occurred in the implementation of policies. Ding Chun, secretary of the Seventh District Committee, found that he only took care of villages and groups with a good work foundation, and did not help villages and groups with a poor work foundation overcome production difficulties. Sihhetun had five households without horses, and because this village had a good work foundation, he tried to lend the village five horses. Houxin Village, which had a weaker work foundation, had 30 percent of its households without horses, and he did not help them solve this problem. Some cadres did not patiently and enthusiastically educate individual farmers, but rather excluded and discriminated against them. Due to the relaxation of leadership over weak villages, many tasks could not be implemented. A district cadre from the Seventh District went to Baohua Village and held a forum with 34 farmers on new farming methods. Most people did not understand them, and new farming methods could not be promoted. From the perspective of leadership methods, most districts implemented the leadership method of grasping key points, making examples, organizing visits, and promoting overall work during spring plowing, but a few districts still implemented the method of overall mobilization, which resulted in generalization and failure to play the due role. Bao Xiangge, secretary of the Sixth District Committee, said: "In the past, we did not distinguish between primary and secondary tasks when deploying work, which scattered our forces, resulting in the loss of the center and the failure to launch the spring plowing production movement." Feng Tongkun, secretary of the Fifth District Committee, said:
    "In the wheat planting stage, I used a one-size-fits-all method and agitated everywhere, resulting in many wheat seeds being sown without kernels. Later, I changed this empty slogan style, first made examples, and organized visits in a prepared and planned manner, which promoted the overall work." After rectification, the awareness of party members in various rural branches throughout the county has been improved, but they still lack leadership methods and cannot meet the needs of the masses. Therefore, the Zhaoyuan County Committee emphasized at the meeting that in terms of leadership methods, we should attach importance to the combination of organizational leadership and ideological leadership, earnestly implement the central government's policy of agricultural mutual aid and cooperation in our work, proceed from objective reality, focus on studying the ideological situation of party members and the masses, find methods to solve problems, and then organize and promote them.
    This year, wide sowing has been universally implemented in Zhaoyuan County, and farming is more meticulous than last year, but there is still a shortage of manure fertilizer. According to the inspection, only 60 villages (32 percent of all villages) and 1,109 groups (33.9 percent of all mutual aid groups) applied base fertilizer to 50 to 60 percent of the total cultivated land, and 10 villages and 166 groups applied less than 50 percent of the fertilizer. The meeting decided: we must educate the masses to apply top dressing reasonably, strictly thin seedlings, and overcome the one-sided idea that wide sowing can produce more grain. The implementation of "staggered planting" this year is beneficial to thinning seedlings, but we must start early to be able to thin them. Men, women, young and old, must make preparations for thinning seedlings and top dressing. Women and semi-laborers should hurry up to accumulate fertilizer, so as to be close to thinning seedlings. We must also mobilize the masses to dig up "large-eyed thief" pests and destroy crow nests to protect seedlings. In villages and groups that have finished planting, we must conduct technical assessments and leadership summaries, identify new record lands, and propose the content of the next competition. We should pay attention to promoting the advanced experience of various districts, and identify and promote farmers' technical creations under the principle of combining science and technology. The County Committee plans to organize district and village cadres to visit local state-owned farms in early June, and at the same time mobilize to carry out the summer hoeing competition movement.
    After the meeting, the responsible comrades of the Zhaoyuan County Committee and various government departments led working groups to various districts to inspect and promote drought resistance, top dressing, and seedling thinning. (Xi Jing San)

    中共肇源县委检查春耕领导工作中的问题
    决定进一步加强政策思想领导，改进工作方法
    中共肇源县委在五月初召集各区区委正副书记开会，检查总结了春耕播种中的领导问题，布置了下一步的工作。
    今年春耕播种时期，肇源县委为了在去年实行新耕作法的基础上继续挖掘生产潜力，打破大部分群众怕实行新耕作法费工和怕劳动力不够的思想顾虑，首先深入到孟克里村和群众商量，采取“排开种”、“五边作业”（详细内容见“挖不尽的潜力”一文）、“全面发动妇女一次定苗”等办法，做到等距宽播、间苗省工。这些办法在孟克里村重点试验后，收到显著成效，肇源县委立即具体组织推广，并实行了“一点多面、连环参观”的领导方法，在春耕生产中进一步推行了新耕作法。
    根据中央有关农村工作的文件的精神来检查，肇源县的农村工作中还存在着一些问题。各区领导干部对农业生产互助合作方针和党关于农村工作的全面政策认识的还不够清楚，政策思想水平不高。例如，对贫困农民的扶助，对个体农民的团结教育，对工作基础薄弱的地区和低级互助组加强领导等问题，都缺乏正确的认识，因此，在执行政策的时候就发生了偏差。七区区委书记丁春检查出自己只照顾工作基础好的村、组，而不帮助工作基础较差的村、组克服生产中的困难的毛病。四合屯有五户没有马，因为这个村工作基础较好，他就设法贷给这个村五匹马。工作基础较薄弱的后新村有百分之三十的户没有马，他就没有帮助他们解决这个问题。有些干部对单干农民不是耐心、热情地进行教育，而是排斥、歧视。由于对薄弱村放松领导，就使得许多工作贯彻不下去。七区一个区干部到宝华村，找了三十四个农民座谈新耕作法，大部分人都不了解，新耕作法就不能推行了。从领导方法上来检查，大部分区在春耕中都实行了抓住重点，作出样子，组织参观，推动全面的领导方法，但少数区还是实行全面轰开的办法，结果流于一般化，不能发挥应有的作用。六区区委书记包向革检查说：“过去我们布置工作不分主次，分散了力量，结果丢掉了中心，春耕生产运动搞不起来。”五区区委书记冯同昆说：
    “我在种麦阶段就是用一把抓的方法，到处鼓动，结果很多麦子白籽下地；以后转变了这种空喊的作风，先搞出样子，有准备有计划地组织参观，才推动了全面。”全县的各个农村支部经过整党以后，党员的觉悟是提高了，但领导办法少，还不能满足群众的要求。因此，肇源县委在会议上强调指出：在领导方法上应重视组织领导和思想领导相结合，应在工作中认真贯彻中央的农业互助合作的方针政策，从客观实际出发，集中研究党员、群众的思想情况，找出解决问题的方法，然后加以组织推广。
    今年肇源全县普遍实行了宽播，耕作比去年细致一些，但粪肥还是不足。据检查，上底粪的耕地仅达耕地总面积百分之五十至六十的有六十个村（占全部村庄百分之三十二）、一千一百零九个组（占全部互助组百分之三十三点九），其中有十个村和一百六十六个组上的粪还不足百分之五十。会议决定：要教育群众合理追肥，严格间苗，克服片面认为宽播就可以多打粮的思想。今年实行“排开种”对间苗是有好处的，但是也要早动手才能间得过来，男女老少都要做间苗追肥的准备工作，妇女半劳动力要赶快积肥发粪，好近接间苗工作。还要发动群众挖“大眼贼”害虫、捣老鸹窝，以保全苗。在种完地的村、组，要普遍进行技术评比和领导总结，鉴定新纪录地，提出下步竞赛的内容。要注意推广各区的先进经验，在科学与技术相结合的原则下，鉴定与推广农民的技术创造。县委计划在六月初组织区村干部到地方国营农场参观，同时动员开展夏锄竞赛运动。
    会议结束以后，肇源县委及政府各部门负责同志即分别率领工作组深入各区检查推动抗旱、追肥、间苗等工作。（奚敬三）
