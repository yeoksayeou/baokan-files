　　A Bumper Harvest on the "Sino-Korean International Friendship Dam"
    Yang Yixiong
    September in North Korea is the season when crops are ripe. In the large dam area of ​​Namjeong-ri, Kimcheon County, as far as the eye can see, there are rice plants more than half the height of a person. The rice ears all droop with their plump heads, swaying happily in the breeze. The autumn sun shines on this rice sea, emitting a golden, enchanting shimmer. Beside the dam area, a river lies quietly. The clear water flows quietly from a distant, unseen place, along the stony riverbed, along the brand-new levee, and flows to another remote place that cannot be seen. The levee body is densely covered with withered Pan-Gen grass and foxtail grass. In many places in the rice fields, harvesting has already begun. Most of the young girls and young women wear towels wrapped around their heads, short white tops with two ribbons trailing in front, and black or other colored skirts. Some young mothers also carry their children on their backs. They operate skillfully and nimbly. The melodious and moving singing, full of emotion, is constantly mixed with hearty laughter, floating in the clear air. In a rice field near the dam, a middle-aged couple is harvesting with two girls. An old lady is sitting on the edge of the field. A boy who has just learned to walk is crawling on the grass beside her, naked, playing with two grasshoppers. I and a Korean language liaison comrade walked up to chat with the old lady.
    "Good harvest this year, old lady!" We greeted her with a smile, and found a place to sit down.
    "Good, comrade." She glanced at us and said with a smile, "The crops this year are really something to talk about, a ten-year harvest."
    "This is your child, right?" The liaison comrade picked up the child from the ground, put it on his lap, and gently stroked the child's slightly chubby little face. The old lady glanced at the child with loving eyes, nodded with a smile, and excitedly told us that the people in the field were her son, daughter-in-law, and two granddaughters; the eldest granddaughter was eighteen years old this year, and the younger one was fifteen years old, and both were in elementary school. There was also an eleven-year-old grandson at home taking care of the house. … At this time, the middle-aged couple and the two girls also put down their work and walked over. We greeted each other and started talking.
    "Speaking of which, we really should thank the Volunteer Army comrades! If they hadn't helped repair this dam, we would have fled to other places to escape famine long ago, how dare we expect any harvest!" The middle-aged man wiped the sweat from his forehead, turned his face, glanced at the dam, and lowered his head to say softly.
    "That's right! Since the American bandits bombed the dikes here, for the past two years, it has been either drought or flood, making it impossible for the people in this area to survive! Alas... If it weren't for the good hearts of the Volunteer Army, who gave us food relief and helped us repair the dikes, our whole family would have starved to death!" The old lady also said with emotion.
    "We should help the folks when they have difficulties. The Chinese and Korean people are one family!" I said with a smile.
    "Grandma, I heard people say that the Volunteer Army comrades who helped us repair the dam later went to the '38th Parallel'!" The fifteen-year-old girl sitting next to the old lady also opened her mouth at this time, pulled her grandmother's sleeve, and said softly. Then, she raised her face and naively asked us: "Comrade, do you think they went to the '38th Parallel'? ... Oh, you are not with them, are you?" She was a girl with a very delicate face, a long face, slender eyebrows, a straight nose, and thin lips. Before we could answer, she turned around and said to her mother: "Mom, those Volunteer Army comrades are really not afraid of the cold, even when there is still ice floating in the water, they go into the water barefoot to pick up stones. When we offered them soybean sprouts, tofu, and other things to comfort them, they refused to accept anything. Aunt Jin was so sad that she shed tears!" The child's naive words brought us back to the unforgettable moments of memory.
    In the late spring of 1952, our troops were stationed in the Kimcheon County area. In order to help the people of Namjeong-ri eliminate floods, we specially dispatched more than a thousand people to rebuild a dam and a levee about three thousand meters long for them. After mobilization, the enthusiasm of the commanders and fighters for labor boiled like boiling water. On the first day of construction, the mobile newsletters of each unit's construction site were filled with letters of determination and challenge and response letters between squads, platoons, or individuals. A sixteen or seventeen-year-old comrade named Zhang Lanxin, from Sichuan, had only been in the army for half a year. He wrote in his letter of determination: "Although my strength is not great, I want to work more; even if my hands are worn out and my shoulders are swollen, I will persist and never complain. ..." Zhang Lanxin's determination represented the will and enthusiasm of all the soldiers.
    Although it was late spring, the weather in North Korea was still quite cold. Due to intense labor, even though the soldiers took off their cotton coats, sweat still flowed down their foreheads. Some waved shovels and picks to build the base of the dike; some transported stones and wood from the nearby mountains; some went barefoot, rolled up their trouser legs, and went into the icy, knee-deep water to move stones and build the dam foot. On the construction site, there were crowds of people working hard from morning to night. The dam area was filled with singing, laughter, cheers, applause, and the metallic sound of shovels and picks hitting hard objects. Cultural instructors excitedly broadcasted those glorious labor deeds through self-made megaphones. The folks in the nearby villages happily came to the construction site in groups of three or five with tofu, rice cakes, or wild vegetables freshly picked from the mountains that morning to express their gratitude. Members of the Korean Democratic Women's League of Namjeong-ri, wearing brightly colored dresses, were divided into several groups and enthusiastically washed clothes for the soldiers at the construction site; children also came to the construction site in groups to sing and dance. It was truly a touching and vivid picture embodying the friendship between China and Korea! Many people had swollen shoulders and blisters on their palms. The little comrade named Zhang Lanxin had blisters on both hands. The medic applied some mercurochrome and bandaged them, and he happily threw himself into the hot labor again. One day, a reporter from the troops asked him:
    "Little comrade, how is it? Are you tired?" At that time, he had just carried a stone back with someone and was sitting on the ground taking a breath. When he heard someone asking him, he raised his face, glanced at the reporter, and shook his head with a smile. This little soldier was small, but very strong, with a round, chubby face and a pair of big, bright, and energetic eyes.
    "Not tired? That's not true, right? Good! I'll ask you, why are you working so hard?" The reporter asked him with a smile. The little comrade rolled his eyes, smiled, and asked: "Why not, comrade!" Then he said: "This dam is very important! Many Korean folks rely on it for food! If I don't do a good job, how can I be worthy of the four characters 'Resist America, Aid Korea'? And I would be letting down my own 'determination'! Comrade, what do you say?" Several soldiers nearby were amused by him and said in unison: "Hey! Although Little Zhang is young, he knows a lot of sense!" The little soldier blushed when he heard everyone joking with him, and walked away embarrassedly with his carrying pole rope.
    Ten days after construction began, a brand-new and solid dam and a long levee proudly appeared in the large dam area of ​​Namjeong-ri. At the completion celebration, the commander of the dike-repairing troops accepted eight silk banners presented by the people and government of Kimcheon County amidst warm and lasting applause. The folks all happily said: "Good, we will never have to worry about floods again!" This "Sino-Korean International Friendship Dam," which symbolizes the deep friendship between the Chinese and Korean people, brought a bumper harvest to the people of Namjeong-ri, Korea, and also brought them a memory that will forever be in their hearts. The women and children in this area often sing affectionately:
    The Imjin River is deep and deep, the Chinese and Korean people are linked heart to heart!
    Tell our hardships to the Volunteer Army, tell our hardships to our loved ones.
    The Volunteer Army avenged us!
    The Volunteer Army saved our lives! (Attached picture)

　　“中朝国际友谊坝”上的丰收
    杨亦雄
    北朝鲜的九月天，正是庄稼熟透了的季节。金川郡南亭里一带的大坝子里，一眼望不到头，尽是半人多高的稻子。稻穗都低垂着肥大的脑袋，在微风中愉快地摆动，秋天的太阳照在这片稻海上，发着金色的魅人的闪光。大坝子的一边，静静地躺着一条河流。清清的水，从望不见的远方，沿着沙石底的河床，沿着崭新的大堤，静静地流过来，又朝着另外一个望不见的遥远的地方流了过去。堤身已被枯黄了的攀根草和狗尾草，密密地覆盖了。稻田的好些地方，已经在收割。那些年轻的姑娘们和少妇们，多半用毛巾裹着头，穿着短短的前面拖着两根飘带的白上衣，围着黑色或其他颜色的裙子。有些年青的妈妈，身上还背着小孩。她们矫健地熟练地操作着。那婉转的充满着情感的动人的歌声，不时地夹着爽朗的笑声，在晴明的空中飘荡。靠近水坝旁的一块稻田里，一对中年夫妇领着两个姑娘在收割。地头坐着个老太太，一个刚会走路的男孩，光着屁股，爬在她身旁的草地上，抓着两个蚱蜢在顽耍。我和一位朝语联络员同志，走上前去，和那老太太闲聊起来。
    “今年收成好哇！老大娘。”我们笑着向她打招呼，一面找个地方坐了下来。
    “好啊，同志。”她朝我们瞧了瞧，便笑着说：“今年庄稼真没有什么说的，十成年景。”
    “这是您的孩子吧？”联络员同志把孩子从地上抱了起来，放在膝上，轻轻抚摸着孩子的微胖的小脸。老太太用慈爱的眼光扫了一下孩子，微笑着点点头，并且兴奋地告诉我们：在地里的是她的儿、媳和两个孙女儿；大孙女今年十八岁，小的十五岁，都在上小学。还有个十一岁的大孙子，在家里看家。……这时那中年夫妇和那两个姑娘也都放下活，走了过来。我们彼此打个招呼，便谈起来了。
    “讲起来，真该感谢志愿军同志哩！要不是他们帮着修好了这座水坝，我们早就到别的地方逃荒去了，哪里还敢指望什么收成呢！”那中年汉子用手抹了抹额上的汗，转过脸，朝水坝那边瞧了瞧，便俯下头，轻声地说着。
    “可不是！自从美国强盗炸坏了这里的堤坝后，这一两年，不是旱就是淹，害得我们这一带老百姓简直活不了！唉……要不是志愿军心肠好，救济我们食粮，帮我们修堤坝，我们这一家子都得饿死！”老太太也感慨地说。
    “老乡们有困难，我们应该帮助。中朝人民是一家嘛！”我笑着说。
    “奶奶，我听人家说，帮我们修坝子的那些志愿军同志后来都到‘三八线’去了哩！”那个坐在老太太旁边的、十五岁的小姑娘这时也开了口，拉了拉她祖母的衣袖，轻声地说。随后，仰起脸，天真地问我们：“同志，你说，他们是上‘三八线’去了吗？……噢，你们不是和他们在一起的吧？”那是个面孔生得很秀气、有着一张长方脸、细长的眉、端正的鼻子和薄薄嘴唇的姑娘。她还没等我们回答又转过身子，对她娘说：“妈，那些志愿军同志真不怕冷，水里还漂着冰呢，就赤着脚下水捞石头。慰问他们豆芽、豆腐什么的，说什么也不收；金大妈还为这难过得流了泪哩！”孩子天真的话，又把我们引入那永远难忘的时刻的回忆中了。
    一九五二年的春末，我们这个部队，那时正驻在金山郡一带。为了帮助南亭里人民消除水患，特地抽出一千多人，给他们重修一座水坝和长约三千公尺的河堤。指战员们经过动员后，劳动热情像滚水似地沸腾起来。开工头一天，各单位的工地流动快报上，都贴满了决心书和班、排或个人之间的挑战、应战书。一个十六、七岁的名叫张兰新的小同志，四川人，参军才半年，他在决心书上写着：“我的力气虽然不大，但我要多干活；手磨破了，肩磨肿了，也坚持着干，决不叫苦。……”张兰新的决心代表着全体战士们的意志和热情。
    虽然是暮春，北朝鲜的天气还是相当冷的。由于强烈的劳动，尽管战士们脱掉了棉衣，汗水仍不断地从额上流下来。他们有的挥着锹镐打堤基；有的从附近大山上搬运石头和木料；有的光着脚、卷起裤管、下到冰凉的深及膝盖的水里搬石块，砌坝脚。工地上，每天从早到晚到处都是紧张工作着的人群。大坝子里，充满着歌声、笑声、欢呼声、喝采声和那锹镐碰在坚硬的东西上所发出的金属声。文化教员们用自制的喇叭筒，兴奋地广播着那些光辉的劳动事迹。附近村庄里的老乡们，欢天喜地的三五成群的带着豆腐、打糕或是当天早晨刚从山上采集来的野菜，到工地上来慰问；南亭里朝鲜民主妇女同盟的盟员们，穿着色彩鲜艳的衣裙，分成好几个小组，到工地上热情地给战士们洗衣服；孩子们也成群结队的在工地上唱着跳着。真是一幅感人的体现中朝友谊的活生生的图画！不少人肩膀肿了，手心里磨起了血泡。那个叫张兰新的小同志，双手都磨破了，卫生员给他擦了点红药水，包了包，他便又愉快地投入火热的劳动中去了。一天，部队里的一位记者问他：
    “小同志，怎么样？累了吧？”那时，他刚和别人抬回来一块石头，坐在地上歇口气，听见有人问他，便仰起脸，朝那位记者瞅了瞅，笑着摇了摇头。这位小战士，个儿小小的，但长得很结实，圆圆的、胖胖的脸蛋，一对大眼睛，明亮亮的很有神。
    “不累？假的吧？好！我问你，你为什么干活干得这样起劲呢？”记者又笑着问他。那个小同志翻起一双大眼，含笑地反问道：“为什么不呢？同志！”接着又说：“这座水坝，关系可大着哩！好多朝鲜老乡要靠它吃饭啊！我要不好好干，那还对得起‘抗美援朝’四个大字吗？也对不起我自己的‘决心’呀！同志，你说呢？”旁边好几个战士，都被他逗得笑起来，齐声地说道：“嘿！小张年纪虽小，道理可懂得不少！”那个小战士听大家在打趣他，红着脸，不好意思地拿起扁担绳子走开了。
    开工后的第十天，一座崭新坚固的水坝和长长的河堤，便骄傲地出现在南亭里的大坝子里。在庆祝竣工大会上，修堤部队的首长，在热烈的经久不息的掌声中，接受了金川郡人民和政府所献的八面锦旗。老乡们都欢天喜地地说：“好了，今后再也不怕闹水灾了！”这一座标志着中朝人民深厚友谊的“中朝国际友谊坝”给朝鲜南亭里人民带来了丰收，同时，也带给他们以永系心头的怀念。这一带的妇女和孩子们常常亲切地唱着：
    临津江水深又深啊，中朝人民心连心啊！
    把苦难诉给志愿军，把苦难诉给我们的亲人。
    志愿军替我们报了仇啊！
    志愿军又救了我们的命啊！（附图片）
