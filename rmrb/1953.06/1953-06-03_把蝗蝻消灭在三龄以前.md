    Eliminate Locust Nymphs Before the Third Instar

    According to materials from various locust-affected areas, most locust nymphs have already entered the third instar. Due to the lack of thorough egg surveys in many areas, the area of summer nymph occurrence this year exceeds the original estimates. This illustrates that this year's locust control work is a very important task.

    Currently, the leading organs in some locust-affected areas have not paid sufficient attention to locust control work. They have already relaxed egg survey work, and now they are not paying attention to hatch monitoring and locust nymph surveys. This makes it difficult to monitor the activities of locust nymphs and impossible to seize the favorable opportunity to eliminate locust nymphs before the third instar. Some leading organs have misunderstood the principle of focusing on pesticides and equipment in locust control. They believe that having pesticides and equipment solves everything, and they no longer organize sufficient manpower to cooperate with pesticides and equipment to capture and kill locust nymphs. Some people are blindly optimistic about locust control work, believing that scouts and pesticide operators have been trained, and locust control headquarters have been established, so they do not seriously conduct inspections and supervision. All of these will cause passivity in locust control work, waste manpower and resources, and even cause unnecessary losses.

    Now that locust control work has reached a critical stage, leading organs in various locust-affected areas must earnestly implement the central government's locust control policy, quickly inspect pesticides and equipment, organize mass forces, strengthen reconnaissance work, and accurately grasp the locust situation. In areas where pesticide powder is adequately prepared, pesticide powder spraying should be used as soon as possible; in areas where pesticide powder is inadequately prepared, artificial capture and killing should be carried out quickly using various methods. Do not miss the favorable opportunity to eliminate locust nymphs by waiting for pesticides. Resolutely eliminate locust nymphs before the third instar.

### 把蝗蝻消灭在三龄以前

    把蝗蝻消灭在三龄以前
    根据蝗区各地材料，大部蝗蝻已经进入三龄。由于不少地区没有周密地进行查卵工作，今年夏蝻发生面积超过原来估计面积。这就说明了今年的治蝗工作是一项非常重大的任务。
    目前有些蝗区的领导机关还没有把治蝗工作重视起来。他们已经放松了查卵工作，现在又不重视查孵化、查蝗蝻的工作，这就很难监视蝗蝻的活动，就无法掌握把蝗蝻消灭在三龄以前的有利时机。有些领导机关对于治蝗以药械为主的精神了解得是错误的。他们以为有了药械就万事大吉了，再不去组织足够的人力，配合药械捕打蝗蝻。有些人对于治蝗工作盲目乐观，认为侦查员、药械手都已经训练好了，治蝗指挥部也成立了，因而不去认真地进行检查和督促。所有这些都将造成治蝗工作的被动，浪费人力和物力，甚至引起不应有的损失。
    现在治蝗工作已到紧张阶段，各蝗区领导机关必须认真贯彻中央治蝗方针，迅速检查药械，组织群众力量，加强侦查工作，准确掌握蝗情。在药粉准备充足的地区，应尽先使用药粉扑杀；在药粉准备不足的地区，应迅速用各种方法进行人工捕打，不要因等待药剂错过消灭蝗蝻的有利时机，坚决把蝗蝻消灭在三龄以前。
