Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, June 22nd: This agency's reporter interviewed Professor Ikua Oyama, head of the Japanese delegation attending the World Peace Council meeting in Budapest and winner of the Stalin International Prize "For Strengthening International Peace." Oyama answered the questions posed by this agency's reporter as follows:

    Question: What role do you think the World Peace Council meeting in Budapest will play in promoting world peace in the future?

    Answer: I think this meeting will play a big role in promoting world peace. The Japanese people are fighting against re-militarization, against the establishment of military bases by the United States, for the restoration of trade between Japan and China and Japan and the Soviet Union, and for the establishment of normal diplomatic relations with China. I think this meeting will certainly give great encouragement to the Japanese people's struggle for peace. The Japanese issue needs to be resolved in the spirit of great power consultation, therefore, on behalf of the Japanese people, I thank this meeting and its emphasis on the spirit of consultation.

    Question: What impact do you think the realization of the Korean armistice will have on the Japanese situation and peace in the Far East?

    Answer: We believe that the Korean armistice is an indispensable condition for establishing peace in the Far East and the world. The Korean armistice will also remove the excuse for the United States to occupy Japan. Therefore, the Japanese people sincerely hope for a Korean armistice and will concentrate their efforts on achieving it. When Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai put forward his proposal for resolving the Korean issue on March 30th, we responded quickly. However, on the other hand, with the realization of the Korean armistice, the United States will inevitably tighten its control over Japan in practice. Therefore, the Japanese people must work harder to fight. I believe the Japanese people's struggle will eventually have a bright future.

    Question: How do the Japanese people react to the American so-called "using Asians to fight Asians" plan?

    Answer: The Japanese people resolutely oppose the conspiracy of "using Asians to fight Asians." The so-called "using Asians to fight Asians" means that the aggressive forces of American imperialism are weakening, and therefore they have to try to use Asians to achieve their goals of aggression against Asia. Last year, when I was awarded the Stalin International Peace Prize, I published an open letter to Stalin in the Japanese magazine "Remodeling." In this letter, I guaranteed that the Japanese people would never fight against the people of other Asian countries. The Japanese people support my guarantee, and the struggle against "using Asians to fight Asians" is unfolding in Japan. I believe that the opposition of the Japanese people and the Asian people will surely lead to the bankruptcy of this American conspiracy.

    Question: Could you please talk about the recent situation of the Japanese people's struggle for peace?

    Answer: The Japanese people's peace movement is developing day by day. Since I left Japan in May this year, the Japanese people's peace movement has reached a new upsurge. Not only the Japanese working people have joined this movement, but also a wide range of classes, including some conservatives, have participated in this movement. In Gunma, Nagano, and other prefectures, even the prefectural governors have participated in the peace movement. More and more people from the Japanese cultural and scientific circles have joined the "Japanese Cultural People's Conference" to fight for peace. The organization's journal is called "Peace," and it sells 50,000 copies per issue. Japanese students are standing at the forefront of the struggle. They are not only fighting for academic freedom, defending national culture, and opposing American cheap culture, but also fighting for the restoration of trade between Japan and China and Japan and the Soviet Union. The Japanese intelligentsia is increasingly aware that they must struggle together with the working people. When talking about the struggle for peace in the Japanese cultural and educational circles, we cannot but mention the role of the "Japan Teachers and Staff Union" in this struggle. This organization has 500,000 members, and its struggle against militarist education is having an increasing impact on society.

    主张根据大国协商的精神解决日本问题重申日本人民不对亚洲人民作战的决心
    【新华社布达佩斯二十二日电】本社记者访问了出席世界和平理事会布达佩斯会议的日本代表团团长、“加强国际和平”斯大林国际奖金得奖人大山郁夫教授，大山郁夫回答本社记者提出的问题如下：
    问：你认为世界和平理事会布达佩斯会议对于今后促进世界和平将起什么作用？
    答：我想这次会议对于促进世界和平将起很大的作用。日本人民正在为反对重新军国主义化、反对美国建立军事基地、争取恢复日中贸易与日苏贸易、争取和中国建立正常的外交关系而斗争，我想这次会议一定将给予日本人民的和平斗争以很大的鼓舞。日本问题需要在大国协商的精神下求得解决，因此，我代表日本人民感谢这次会议和会议对于协商精神的强调。
    问：你认为朝鲜停战的实现对于日本局势和远东和平会有什么影响？
    答：我们认为朝鲜停战是建立远东与世界和平的必不可少的条件。朝鲜停战也将解除美国占领日本的借口。因此，日本人民真诚希望朝鲜停战，并将集中力量争取朝鲜停战的实现。当中国周恩来总理三月三十日提出解决朝鲜问题的建议时，我们就迅速地响应。但是，在另一方面，随着朝鲜停战的实现，美国必将在实际上更加紧控制日本，因此，日本人民必须更加努力进行斗争。我相信日本人民的斗争终将有光明的前途。
    问：日本人民对于美国的所谓“用亚洲人打亚洲人”的计划反应如何？
    答：日本人民坚决反对“用亚洲人打亚洲人”的阴谋。所谓“用亚洲人打亚洲人”，就意味着美帝国主义的侵略力量正在削弱，因而不得不企图利用亚洲人来达到它的侵略亚洲的目的。去年，我被授予斯大林国际和平奖金时，我曾在日本“改造”杂志上发表致斯大林的公开信，在这封信里，我曾保证日本人民绝不对亚洲其他国家人民作战。日本人民拥护我这一个保证，反对“用亚洲人打亚洲人”的斗争正在日本展开。我相信，日本人民和亚洲人民的反对，必定将使美国这一阴谋宣告破产。
    问：可否请你谈一下日本人民争取和平斗争的最近的情形？
    答：日本人民的和平运动正在日益发展中，自从今年五月我离开日本以后，日本人民的和平运动又有了新的高涨。不仅日本劳动人民参加了这一运动，而且包括某些保守人物在内的广大阶层都参加了这一运动，在群马、长野等县，甚至县长也参加了和平运动。日本文化科学界已有越来越多的人参加到“日本文化人会议”中为和平而斗争，这个组织的机关杂志叫做“和平”，每期能销五万份。日本学生正站在斗争的最前列，他们不仅为争取学术自由、保卫民族文化、反对美国廉价文化而斗争，而且为恢复日中贸易与日苏贸易而斗争。日本知识界正日益觉悟到，必须和劳动人民一起进行斗争。在谈到日本文化教育界争取和平的斗争时，我们不能不谈到“日本教职员工会”在这个斗争中的作用，这个组织拥有五十万会员，它所进行的反对军国主义教育的斗争，正在社会上产生越来越大的影响。
