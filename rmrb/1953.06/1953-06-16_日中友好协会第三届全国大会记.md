    Record of the Third National Congress of the Sino-Japanese Friendship Association
    The Sino-Japanese Friendship Association held its third national congress in Tokyo on May 30th and 31st, amidst the concern of people across Japan, to strengthen and advance the Sino-Japanese friendship movement. A total of 390 representatives and other individuals from 36 prefectures, Hokkaido, and other regions attended the congress, marking an unprecedented scale since the establishment of the Sino-Japanese Friendship Association.
    The congress opened at 10:00 a.m. on May 30th. After Secretary-General of the congress, Masamoto Ozawa, delivered the opening speech, a presidium was elected, consisting of Yoshitaro Hirano, Akira Imamura (Chairman of the Japan Teachers Union, Vice Chairman of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan), Masato Sugawara (representative from Osaka), Masamichi Takatsu (member of the House of Representatives), and Mingqiu Kang (representative of the Overseas Chinese Association in Japan). The congress then read out congratulatory messages and telegrams from various parties. These numerous congratulatory messages and telegrams from various sectors both domestically and abroad demonstrated the widespread support for the Sino-Japanese friendship movement. Among them, the joint congratulatory telegram from nine Chinese groups, including the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions , the All-China Youth Federation, the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, the China People's Relief Administration, the Red Cross Society of China, the Preparatory Committee of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, and the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, was warmly welcomed by the entire audience. Representatives from political parties attending the congress, including Goro Sudo (Japanese Communist Party), Hideo Yamahana (Left-wing Socialist Party), and Takeshi Tobae (Right-wing Socialist Party), also extended warm congratulations to the congress.
    Subsequently, President of the Sino-Japanese Friendship Association, Kanzo Uchiyama, delivered a general report on the work of Sino-Japanese friendship. The report provided detailed explanations on issues such as the repatriation of Japanese residents in China, Sino-Japanese cultural exchange, promotion of Sino-Japanese trade, the return of the remains of victims of the Hanaoka Incident, demands for the establishment of diplomatic relations between Japan and China and between Japan and the Soviet Union, fisheries issues, as well as the organizational status and publications of the Sino-Japanese Friendship Association.
    The report pointed out that Chinese literature and art works are widely welcomed in Japan. When Chinese films such as "The White Haired Girl," "Great Unity of the Chinese Nation," and "We Must Harness the Huai River Well" were screened in Japan, audiences were extremely enthusiastic. Despite the Yoshida government's ban on the public screening of "The White Haired Girl" in cinemas, the film had already been viewed by 200,000 people in large and small gatherings. Slides featuring Chinese construction were also generally welcomed. Chinese plays such as "Xiao Erhei's Marriage" and "Dragon Beard Ditch" have been staged in Japanese cities, and students from Kyoto University have even performed in rural areas. The Progressive Theater Troupe's performance of "Qu Yuan" across the country has achieved great success. The Sino-Japanese Friendship Association Headquarters, the Asia News Agency, and the International Photo News Agency regularly provide magazines and newspapers with photographs related to China. Chinese photo exhibitions, mainly featuring photographs, have been widely and warmly welcomed by the Japanese people. From October to December last year, Chinese photo exhibitions were held in many places from Hokkaido in the north to Kyushu in the south. In Tokyo alone, during November, Chinese photo exhibitions were held in thirty locations for a total of seventy days. Recently, exhibitions have been held not only in schools but also in factories and on the streets. Last autumn, an exhibition introducing Chinese art, including New Year pictures and prints, was held. In February this year, the 6th exhibition of the Japan Art Association featured woodcuts, posters, paper-cuts, Qi Baishi's painting collections, and other items donated by the All-China Association of Fine Arts Workers, alongside Chinese artworks from the Sino-Japanese Friendship Association. The Sino-Japanese Friendship Association also plans to publicly exhibit the gifts brought back by the delegation negotiating the repatriation of Japanese residents, many of which are artworks. On October 27th last year, a "Chinese Music Research Association" was formed by Chinese and Japanese youth at the Lu Xun Commemoration Meeting in Tokyo. On October 30th, the Osaka Youth Music Association performed the "Yellow River Cantata." The music community is currently preparing to stage the "White Haired Girl" opera. Since the establishment of the "Sino-Japanese Translation Symposium" in 1951, forty Chinese literary books have been translated and published to date, with a total circulation of 223,500 copies, and nineteen social science books, with a circulation of 158,500 copies. There are now five bookstores specializing in Chinese books: Uchiyama, Kyokuto, Kokusai, Daian, and Taizan. Recently, more and more people are learning Chinese, with a significant increase in the number of students studying Chinese in universities, and the general public is also requesting Chinese language classes. Various lectures and workshops have begun in Tokyo, Nagoya, and Osaka, teaching Chinese language. Professor Kuraishi's Chinese language lectures on Tokyo's radio broadcasts have been very effective.
    When Kanzo Uchiyama reported on the organizational situation of the Sino-Japanese Friendship Association, he pointed out that the organization has greatly expanded since the second national congress in April 1952. The existing membership has increased by 2.3 times compared to the previous congress, and the existing branches and branch preparatory committees have also increased by 2.4 times compared to the previous congress. The previous congress pointed out the shortcomings of the Sino-Japanese Friendship Association's failure to develop in rural areas, and now rural branch organizations account for 10.5% of the total. Many repatriated residents from China have joined the Sino-Japanese Friendship Association.
    In his report, Kanzo Uchiyama criticized the Yoshida government for adopting various high-handed policies of hostility towards China, and emphasized that the demand for promoting Sino-Japanese friendship is growing among the people nationwide. He called on the Japanese people to unite and promote the development of the Sino-Japanese friendship movement. His report received warm applause from the entire audience.
    Vice-Speaker of the House of Representatives of the Diet and Vice-President of the Sino-Japanese Friendship Association, Torao Hara, delivered a speech. In his speech, he criticized the Yoshida government's policy of hostility towards China and emphasized the necessity of people's diplomacy to promote Sino-Japanese friendship.
    Yoshitaro Hirano, representing the delegation negotiating the repatriation of Japanese residents, reported on the work process. He said that Japanese residents who have returned to Japan have not yet received a guarantee of their livelihoods. Returning residents' representatives, Yoshio Araki and Moritoku Otsuka, successively paid tribute to the congress, reported on the friendly treatment of Japanese residents by the People's Republic of China, and at the same time complained to the congress about the cold treatment and so-called ideological investigations suffered by returning residents from the Japanese government. Overseas Chinese representative Kang Mingqiu, in his speech, expressed his gratitude to the Japanese Red Cross Society, the Japanese Peace Liaison Committee, and the Sino-Japanese Friendship Association, as well as the Japanese people, for their efforts in returning the remains of victims of the Hanaoka Incident and assisting Overseas Chinese in returning to their home country. Next, Representative Ichise of the "Japan Coal Miners' Union Federation," Representative Sakashita of the "Japan Peace Liaison Committee," Shinji Taguchi of the "Sino-Japanese Fisheries Roundtable Conference," Yashiro Ii of the "Japan Committee for the Defense of Peace," Shozo Nomo of the "General Council of Trade Unions of Japan," and Shiji Yoshida of the "Japan Federation of Industrial Organizations" delivered congratulatory messages to the congress respectively.
    In the afternoon, the congress continued, and Tang Yueli, a student representative from Yokohama Chinese School, revealed to the congress the persecution of the Yokohama Chinese School by Chiang Kai-shek bandit elements in Taiwan under the protection of the Yoshida government, and reported on the school's teachers and students carrying out a resolute and unyielding struggle.
    The congress then entered into discussions on the current movement direction and work tasks of the Sino-Japanese Friendship Association. Standing Director Taneo Tanaka explained the draft proposed by the headquarters. The draft pointed out that the Sino-Japanese friendship movement has entered a new stage of development, criticized the sectarian shortcomings of the Sino-Japanese Friendship Association in making the association a national people's organization in the past, and emphasized that it must be closely linked to the demands of people of all strata to expand the scope of the movement. The draft also stipulated that the current activities of the Sino-Japanese Friendship Association should be devoted to promoting Sino-Japanese trade, conducting cultural exchanges, organizing gatherings of working people from China and Japan, completing the work of assisting Japanese residents in returning to their home country, assisting Overseas Chinese in returning to their home country and returning the remains of victims of the Hanaoka Incident, assisting in resolving fisheries issues, demanding a Korean armistice and holding a five-power conference, and demanding the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Japan. The congress immediately proceeded with discussions. The representatives enthusiastically put forward supplementary opinions, and in order to accept these opinions, the congress decided to supplement the draft and leave it for discussion on the following day. Subsequently, the following nine resolutions were discussed and passed:
    1. On promoting Sino-Japanese trade;
    2. On striving for a Korean armistice;
    3. On the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Japan;
    4. On supporting the invitation of representatives of the Chinese Red Cross to Japan;
    5. On assisting Overseas Chinese in returning to their home country;
    6. On returning the remains of victims of the Hanaoka Incident;
    7. On assisting repatriated Japanese residents;
    8. On conducting cultural and academic exchanges with China;
    9. On promoting Sino-Japanese fisheries talks.
    Each of these resolutions was passed after heated discussions. When discussing and passing the resolution on assisting Overseas Chinese in returning to their home country, the resolution "to abolish the insulting language used towards the People's Republic of China and the unequal treatment of Overseas Chinese" was incidentally proposed and passed. It was specifically decided to request major newspapers to correct the incorrect appellations of the People's Republic of China; and to lodge a protest with the Ministry of Education and the Textbook Review Committee, pointing out that middle and primary school textbooks should not inherit the distorted introductions to China in the old textbooks.
    After passing the resolutions, the congress proceeded with elections. The elected were: President, Jiichiro Matsumoto; Vice-Presidents, Toshio Toyoshima, Torao Hara, Yoshitaro Hirano; Advisors, Ikuo Oyama, Akira Kazami, Hyoe Ouchi, Tokutaro Kitamura, Raicho Hiratsuka; Directors, Kanzo Uchiyama, Masaharu Hatanaka, Karoku Hosokawa, Goro Sudo, Kinkazu Saionji, Taneo Tanaka, Masamichi Takatsu, Makoto Hori, Kumakazu Yamamoto, Masao Suzuki, Hideo Sakurai, Kisuke Miyakoshi, Michio Iwamura, Tokusaburo Tan, Shiji Yoshida, Minoru Takano, Tomitaro Kaneda, Akira Imamura, Hiroshi Minami, Masamoto Ozawa, Masao Shimada, Koichiro Miyazaki, Toshio Kashima, and 105 others. In addition, 88 councilors were elected, including Hiroo Wada and Tadashi Yoshida. The directors and councilors broadly included well-known figures from all walks of life.
    After the election, the congress read out dozens of congratulatory telegrams, including a congratulatory telegram from the Chilean Peace Committee from distant South America.
    Thus, the congress concluded the first day's agenda. Finally, the Chinese film "Long Live Peace!" was screened.
    May 31st, the second day of the congress. The venue was moved to the "All Japan Banks Association Hall." The morning was dedicated to reports from local representatives. Representatives from Osaka, Kyoto, Miyagi, Kyushu, Tokyo, Tochigi, Hokkaido, Saitama, Ishikawa, Kagawa, Kobe, Aomori and other places successively reported on the development of the Sino-Japanese friendship movement in various regions. These reports vividly demonstrated that people from all walks of life in Japan are widely launching Sino-Japanese friendship movements in various ways; at the same time, they reflected that protecting the lives of repatriated Japanese residents has become a major issue, and the persecution of the people's Sino-Japanese friendship movement by the police authorities of the Yoshida government is becoming increasingly blatant.
    In the afternoon, the congress continued its discussions. Representatives launched heated discussions on the direction and tasks, daily activities and organization of the Sino-Japanese Friendship Association, and expressed their views enthusiastically. The congress supplemented the draft proposed by the headquarters regarding the current movement direction and work tasks of the Sino-Japanese Friendship Association with the policy of practicing the congress slogan "Develop the Sino-Japanese Friendship Association into an organization of the people of the whole country", and finally unanimously passed it.
    The congress passed a declaration, which pointed out: "The vast majority of the people of the whole country, like us, are turning their eyes to China, and are considering how to be friendly with China more enthusiastically than we are. We are watching this reality with surprised eyes. The Third National Congress unanimously recognized: 'The Sino-Japanese friendship movement is facing a new period, a period of rapid development'. However, the relationship between Japan and China has not improved at all, cultural exchanges are hindered, and even trade is not free. Most of the people of the whole country are eager to know the actual situation in China, but unfounded rumors still dominate the pages of newspapers." Next, the declaration pointed out: "Our Sino-Japanese Friendship Association is still small. Our congress faces this serious reality squarely and clarifies our current tasks. We must develop the Sino-Japanese Friendship Association into an organization of the people of the whole country, unite the strength of the people of the whole country, break through obstacles, and realize Sino-Japanese friendship." The declaration finally called on the Japanese people: "For the peace and prosperity of Japan, let us join hands and move towards the road of Sino-Japanese friendship! Let us use consultation to solve all outstanding issues between the two countries based on the spirit of peace and friendship! Let us promote close exchanges between the cultures of the two countries and establish a solid friendship between the two nations!"
    The congress passed a letter of respect to Chairman Mao Zedong of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, a letter of thanks to the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, a letter of thanks to the All-China Federation of Trade Unions and other eight organizations, a letter to the people of Asian countries, and a resolution of thanks to China regarding the return of fishing boats and crew members.
    The congress closed amidst the shouts of "Long live Sino-Japanese friendship" after the closing speech by the President of the Sino-Japanese Friendship Association, Kanzo Uchiyama.
    That night, the participating representatives held a commemorative dinner party at the Japan Youth Hall. The representatives from all over the country, full of increased confidence, returned to their original posts and are working even harder to promote the Sino-Japanese friendship movement.

    日中友好协会第三届全国大会记
    五月三十日、三十一日两天，在日本全国人民的关怀下，日中友好协会在东京召开了第三届全国大会，以加强和推进日中友好运动。出席大会的全国三十六个都、道、府、县代表和其他人士共三百九十人，这种盛况是日中友好协会成立以来前所未有的。
    大会于五月三十日上午十时开幕。大会秘书长小泽正元致开会词后，推选出平野义太郎、今村彰（日本教职员工会主席、日本工会总评议会副主席）、菅原昌人（大阪代表）、高津正道（国会众议院议员）、康鸣球（旅日华侨总会代表）组成主席团。大会宣读了各方的祝词和贺电。这许多来自国外和国内各阶层的祝词和贺电，说明了日中友好运动已经得到了广泛的支持。其中中国人民保卫世界和平委员会、中华全国总工会、中华全国民主青年联合总会、中华全国民主妇女联合会、中华全国文学艺术界联合会、中国人民救济总会、中国红十字会总会、中华全国工商业联合会筹备委员会、中国国际贸易促进委员会等九团体联合贺电，获得了全场热烈的欢迎。出席大会的政党代表须藤五郎（日本共产党）、山花秀雄（左派社会党）、户叶武（右派社会党）等三人，也向大会致以热情的祝贺。
    接着，日中友好协会理事长内山完造作了关于日中友好工作的总报告。报告中就旅华日侨回国，日中文化交流、促进日中贸易，送还花冈事件等被害者的骨灰，要求建立日中、日苏邦交，渔业等问题及日中友好协会的组织情况和机关报刊情况等，作了详尽的说明。
    报告中指出：中国文学艺术作品，在日本受到广泛的欢迎。中国影片“白毛女”、“中华民族大团结”、“一定要把淮河修好”等在日本映出时，观众极为踊跃。尽管吉田政府禁止“白毛女”影片在电影院公开上映，但“白毛女”在大、小集会上的映出，观众就已有了二十万人。取材自中国建设的幻灯片，也受到普遍欢迎。中国话剧“小二黑结婚”、“龙须沟”等已在日本城市中上演，京都大学学生并且到农村中演出。前进剧团在全国各地演出了“屈原”，获得很大的成绩。日中友协总会、亚细亚通讯社、国际照片新闻社经常提供各杂志、报纸刊载有关中国的照片。以照片为主的中国图片展览会受到日本人民普遍而热烈的欢迎。在去年十月到十二月间，北自北海道、南迄九州的许多地方，都举行了中国图片展览会。仅在十一月份，东京一地就在三十个场所举行了共达七十天的中国图片展览会。最近，展览会不但在学校中，而且在工厂里或街头上也纷纷展出了。去年秋天，曾举办了介绍中国美术的中国年画版画展览会，今年二月，日本美术会的第六次展览会上，将中华全国美术工作者协会寄赠的木刻、招贴画、剪纸、齐白石画集等，和日中友好协会的中国美术品一齐陈列展览。日中友好协会最近并拟将这次洽商日侨归国代表团带回的礼品
    （其中很多是美术品）公开展览。去年十月二十七日，在东京市的鲁迅纪念会上，中、日两国的青年组成了“中国音乐研究会”。十月三十日，大阪青年音乐协会公演了“黄河大合唱”。音乐界现正准备上演“白毛女”歌剧。自从一九五一年“日中翻译座谈会”成立以来，到现在为止，已经翻译出版了中国文学书籍四十种，计发行二十二万三千五百册，社会科学书籍十九种，发行十五万八千五百册。专门供给中国书籍的书店，已有内山、极东、国际、大安、泰山等五家。最近学习中国语文的人愈来愈多，各大学学习中国语文的学生显著增加，一般群众也要求举办中国语文讲习班。东京、名古屋、大阪等地已开始举办了各种讲习会，讲授中国语文。仓石教授在东京市无线电广播教授中国语文的讲座，收到很大的效果。
    内山完造报告到日中友好协会的组织情况时，指出：从一九五二年四月第二届全国大会以来，日中友好协会的组织已经大为扩展。现有的会员比上次大会时增加了二点三倍，现有支会和支会筹备会也比上次大会增加了二点四倍。上届大会曾指出了日中友好协会组织未能在农村中发展的缺点，现在农村中的支会组织已占总数的百分之十点五。从中国归来的侨民中，有很多人参加了日中友好协会。
    内山完造在报告中指责吉田政府采取各种横行霸道的敌视中国的政策，并强调指出：目前全国人民对促进日中友好的要求，日益高涨。他号召日本全国人民团结起来，促进日中友好运动的发展。他的报告获得了全场热烈的鼓掌。
    本届国会众议院副议长、日中友好协会副会长原彪致词。他在致词中抨击吉田政府敌视中国的政策，强调促进日中友好的人民外交的必要性。
    平野义太郎代表洽商日侨回国代表团报告工作经过。他说：归国后的日侨，迄今尚未获得生活上的保证。归国侨民代表荒木吉雄、大塚盛德，相继向大会致敬，报告了中华人民共和国人民政府对日侨的友善待遇，同时向大会诉说侨民回国后遭受日本政府的冷酷待遇和所谓思想调查的迫害。华侨代表康鸣球在发言中对日本红十字会、日本和平联络委员会和日中友好协会三团体及日本人民在送还花冈事件被害者遗骨和援助华侨回国问题上所作的努力，表示谢意。接着，一濑代表“日本煤矿工会总会”、坂下代表“日本和平联络会”、田口新治代表“日中渔业恳谈会”、伊井弥四郎代表“日本拥护和平委员会”、野本正三代表“日本工会总评议会”、吉田资治代表“日本产业别工会”分别向大会致祝词。
    下午大会继续召开，横滨中华学校学生代表唐月丽，向大会揭露台湾蒋匪帮分子在吉田政府庇护下对横滨中华学校进行迫害的事实，并报告了该校师生进行坚决不屈斗争的情况。
    大会接着进入了日中友好协会当前的运动方针和工作任务的讨论。常任理事田中稔男说明总会提出的草案。这个草案指出了日中友好运动已经进入了新的发展时期，批判了过去日中友好协会在使友协成为全国人民组织方面的宗派主义缺点，强调必须与各阶层人民的要求密切联系起来，扩大运动的范围。草案并拟定日中友好协会当前的活动，应致力于促进日中贸易，进行文化交流，组织日中两国劳动人民的联欢，完成协助日侨回国工作，援助旅日华侨回国及送还花冈事件等被害者的骨灰，协助解决渔业问题，要求朝鲜停战并举行五大国会谈，要求建立日中邦交等运动。大会旋即进行讨论。代表们热心地提出了补充意见，为了接受这些意见，大会决定将草案补充后留待第二天再行讨论。接着，就讨论并通过了下面九项决议案：
    一、关于促进日中贸易问题；
    二、关于争取朝鲜停战问题；
    三、关于建立日中两国邦交问题；
    四、关于支持邀请中国红十字会代表来日本问题；
    五、关于援助旅日华侨回国问题；
    六、关于送还花冈事件等被害者的骨灰问题；
    七、关于援助回国日侨问题；
    八、关于和中国进行文化、学术交流问题；
    九、关于促进日中渔业会谈问题。
    这些决议案，每一个都是在热烈的讨论下通过的。在讨论通过援助旅日华侨回国问题的决议时，附带地提出并通过了“取消对中华人民共和国所用的侮辱性言词及对华侨的不平等待遇”的决议。特别决定要求各大报社修改对中华人民共和国的不正确的称呼；并向文部省和教科书编审委员会提出抗议，指摘中、小学教科书不应袭用旧教科书中对中国的歪曲介绍。
    通过了决议案后，大会就进行选举。计选出：会长松本治一郎，副会长丰岛与志雄、原彪、平野义太郎；顾问大山郁夫、风见章、大内兵卫、北村德太郎、平塚雷鸟；理事内山完造、畑中政春、细川嘉六、须藤五郎、西园寺公一、田中稔男、高津正道、堀真琴、山本熊一、铃木正雄、樱井英雄、宫腰喜助、岩村三千夫、淡德三郎、吉田资治、高野实、兼田富太郎、今村彰、南博、小泽正元、岛田政雄、宫崎幸一郎、加岛敏雄等一百零五名。此外并选出评议员和田博雄，吉田正等八十八人。理事及评议员广泛地包括了各阶层的知名人士。
    选举后，大会又宣读了数十封贺电，包括来自辽远的南美洲的智利和平委员会的贺电。
    这样，大会就结束了第一天的议程。最后，并放映了中国影片“和平万岁！”
    五月三十一日，大会的第二天。会场移至“全日本银行联合会会馆”举行。上午是地方代表的报告，大阪、京都、宫城、九州、东京、枥木、北海道、崎玉、石川、香川、神户、青森等地的代表，先后报告了各地日中友好运动的发展情况。这些报告生动地表明了日本全国各阶层人民正以各种不同的方式，广泛地展开日中友好运动；同时反映了保护归国日侨的生活已成为重大的问题，吉田政府警察当局对各地人民日中友好运动的迫害日益露骨。
    下午，大会继续进行讨论。代表们就日中友好协会的方针任务、日常活动和组织等问题，展开热烈讨论，发言极为踊跃。大会就总会提出的关于日中友好协会当前的运动方针和工作任务草案，补充了关于实践大会口号“把日中友好协会发展成为全国人民的组织”的方针，最后一致通过。
    大会并通过宣言，指出：“全国人民中的绝大多数，都和我们同样地把眼睛朝向了中国，而且比我们更为热心地在考虑着如何和中国友好的问题。我们正以惊喜的目光注视着这一现实。第三届全国大会上一致承认：‘日中友好运动已经面临到一个新的时期，即飞跃发展的时期’。但是，日本和中国之间的关系一点也没有好转，文化交流受到阻挠，连贸易都没有自由，全国人民大都渴望知道中国的实际情况，而毫无根据的谣言仍然独占着报纸的篇幅”。接着，宣言指出：“我们日中友好协会的组织还很小。我们大会正视了这一严重的现实，明确了我们当前的任务，我们必须把日中友好协会发展成为全国人民的组织，团结全国人民的力量，冲破障碍，实现日中友好。”宣言最后号召日本人民：“为了日本的和平与繁荣，让我们紧携着手，向着日中友好的大道迈进吧！让我们根据和平与友好的精神，用协商来解决两国之间的一切悬而未决的问题吧！让我们促使两国文化的密切地交流，建立日中两民族巩固的友谊吧！”
    大会通过了给中华人民共和国中央人民政府毛泽东主席的致敬信，给中国人民保卫世界和平委员会的谢函，给中华全国总工会等八团体的谢函，给亚洲各国人民书以及给中国的关于送回渔船及船员的感谢决议等文件。
    大会在日中友好协会理事长内山完造致闭幕词之后在全场高呼日中友好万岁声中闭幕。
    这天晚上，与会代表们在日本青年馆举行了纪念聚餐会。各地代表满怀着更加增强了的信心，返回原岗位，正更加努力来推广日中友好运动。（附图片）
