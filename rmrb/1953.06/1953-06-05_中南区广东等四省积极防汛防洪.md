Xinhua News Agency report: Since spring and summer, the four provinces south of the Yangtze River in the Central South Region have experienced continuous rainfall, causing water levels in various rivers to gradually rise. Rivers in Guangdong, Guangxi, Jiangxi, and other provinces have already experienced several flood peaks. In response, the Central South Region Flood and Drought Prevention and Production Joint Command, based on years of flood prevention experience in the region and the actual situation of flood prevention projects built in various locations, issued instructions on flood prevention work on May 26, requiring all areas to fully prepare for flood prevention. Currently, Guangdong, Guangxi, Hunan, and Jiangxi provinces are actively carrying out flood prevention work.

	The Pearl River basin experienced widespread rainfall in early and mid-May, causing water levels in various rivers to surge temporarily. Leading cadres from Party and government organs at all levels went to the dikes to lead the masses in vigorous rescue efforts, thus averting major disasters. From May 30 to June 1, the Pearl River basin experienced another round of widespread rainfall, causing water levels in various rivers to rise again. In Heyuan and Dapu, Guangdong Province, water levels rose by more than two meters, and in Zhaoping, in the lower reaches of the Gui River in Guangxi Province, the water level suddenly rose by 5.8 meters. Water levels in most areas are now close to the warning level. Cadres and the masses have already gone to the dikes to guard them and are paying attention to rescue work. Hunan Province has also experienced heavy rainfall in various areas since May, causing water levels in the Xiang, Zi, Yuan, and Li rivers of the Dongting Lake system to rise repeatedly. As the Dongting Lake area entered a tense stage of flood prevention, leading cadres from many counties went to the dikes to lead the masses in fighting the floods. In Yiyang County, a 100-meter-long section of the dike in the 14th Polder showed signs of cracking. All members of the Yiyang County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party mobilized and led more than 300 farmers to rescue it day and night, ensuring safety. A section of the Yanglinzhai New Dike in the South Dongting Lake area was broken by huge waves. Gao Chen, the county magistrate of Xiangyin County People's Government, led farmers to rescue it day and night in the face of wind and rain, protecting the dike. On June 2, the water level in Hengyang rose by 3.4 meters, and the flood peak water level in Lingling was above 102 meters. No accidents have occurred in various areas so far, and they are closely monitoring and defending. After completing rice transplanting, counties in Hunan Province launched a mass inspection of dikes, also checking for ideological complacency. The inspection work was carried out in a relatively thorough and meticulous manner. For example, Nan County, which has always done well in dike construction, discovered 709 large and small hidden dangers during this major inspection. Various areas are now rushing to complete repairs and fix newly discovered hidden dangers. Although the tense period of flooding in the Gan River and Fu River of the Poyang Lake system has passed, there has been widespread rainfall in the past three days, and water levels in various rivers have risen again. In addition, due to continuous rainfall in the upper reaches of some rivers and large mountainous areas in Jiangxi, Guangxi, and Hunan, mountain torrents have occurred. Various areas are strengthening efforts to prevent mountain floods.

    中南区广东等四省积极防汛防洪
    据新华社讯：中南区长江以南四省春夏以来雨水连绵，各江河水位逐步上涨，广东、广西、江西等省内各河流已几次出现洪水峰。为此，中南区防汛防旱抗旱生产联合总指挥部根据全区历年的防汛工作经验和各地兴修防汛防洪工程的实际状况，于五月二十六日发布防汛工作指示，要求各地充分做好防汛准备工作。目前，广东、广西、湖南、江西等四省正积极进行防汛、防洪工作。
    珠江流域五月上中旬曾普遍降雨，各江河水位曾一度暴涨，各地党、政机关负责干部上堤领导群众大力抢救，因此未出大险。从五月三十日到六月一日，珠江流域再次普遍降雨，各江河水位又行回涨，广东省河源、大埔等地的水位都上涨二公尺多，广西省桂江下游昭平的水位突涨五点八公尺，各地水位大多已接近于警戒水位。各地干部和群众已经上堤防守，注意抢险工作。湖南省各地从五月以来降雨也很大，洞庭水系湘、资、沅、澧四水水位都迭次上涨。洞庭湖滨进入紧张的防汛阶段时，许多县的领导干部都上堤领导群众和洪水作斗争。益阳县十四垸有一百公尺长的堤段发生开裂的险象，中共益阳县委员会的委员全体出动，领导三百多农民日夜抢救，得以平安无事。南洞庭湖区的杨林寨新堤曾被巨浪打破了一段，湘阴县人民政府县长高臣领导农民冒着风雨日夜抢救，保卫住了堤防。六月二日，衡阳水位上涨三点四公尺，零陵洪峰水位在一百零二公尺以上，各地目前还未出险，正在密切注意防守中。湖南省各县插秧完毕后，都发动了一次群众性的堤防大检查，并检查思想上的麻痹大意。检查工作进行的较深入细致。如堤工向来做得较好的南县，经这次大检查就发现了大小隐患七百零九处。现各地正在突击完成抢修工程和补修新发现的隐患。鄱阳水系赣江、抚水日前汛情的紧张时期虽已过去，但近三日来普遍降雨，各江河水位目前又有些回涨。此外，江西、广西、湖南有些江河上游地区和大山区因接连降雨，山洪暴发，各地正在加强防止山洪的工作。
