Dear comrades and friends:

　　With boundless excitement and joy, I represent the General Political Department of the People's Revolutionary Military Commission in congratulating the victorious opening of the Second National Congress of the China New Democratic Youth League, and extend the highest revolutionary salute to all the representatives and guests!

　　Comrades! The Chinese People's Liberation Army and the Chinese youth have always been inextricably linked in the history of the Chinese revolution. For the liberation of the nation and society, countless Chinese youth participated in armed struggles against imperialism and domestic reactionaries, unyielding, and advancing wave upon wave. During the Second Domestic Revolutionary War, the vast majority of members of the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army were youth. For example, the famous "Young Communist International Division" was composed of more than 10,000 youth from the Jiangxi base area, of whom more than 70 percent were members of the Chinese Communist Youth League. The young Red Army created heroic deeds in smashing the enemy's several encirclements and suppressions, especially during the 25,000-li Long March, such as crossing the natural barrier of the Wujiang River, crossing the Jinsha River, crossing the Dadu River, traversing snow-capped mountains, crossing grasslands, and breaking through the dangerous Lazikou Pass, until reaching the forward position for resisting Japan in northern Shaanxi. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, tens of millions of working youth and intellectual youth responded to the call of the Chinese Communist Party to resist Japan and save the country, pouring into the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army like a torrent, greatly developing the revolutionary forces of the Chinese people. The world-shaking Battle of Pingxingguan, the eight-year anti-Japanese guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines, and the final defeat of Japanese fascism in cooperation with the great Soviet army, were all inseparable from the heroic struggles of the youth. In the great People's Liberation War, a large number of young workers, peasants, and intellectuals joined the Chinese People's Liberation Army or actively supported the People's Liberation War, giving the Chinese People's Liberation Army endless strength to annihilate 8.07 million Kuomintang bandit troops armed and supported by U.S. imperialism, thereby liberating the entire mainland of China. The youth of the Chinese People's Liberation Army made indelible contributions to the motherland in this historic victory. After the national victory, when the American aggressors openly occupied our Taiwan and attacked Korea, seriously threatening our country's security, patriotic youth and Youth League members enthusiastically responded to the call of the motherland (in the summer of 1951 alone, as many as 330,000 intellectual youth signed up to participate in military cadre schools), ensuring the continuous growth of the motherland's defense forces and supporting and winning the great victory in the struggle to resist America and aid Korea. The facts of the past 20 years vividly illustrate that the Chinese people and the Chinese youth have personally experienced the truth that "without a people's army, the people have nothing" in the long revolutionary struggle, and therefore regard supporting and participating in their own army as their glorious and sacred task. The Chinese People's Liberation Army, with the enthusiastic support of the Chinese people and Chinese youth, has grown from small to large, from weak to strong, experiencing its own glorious path, becoming a force that can never be defeated. Many youth who participated in the people's armed struggle, under the education of the Party and Chairman Mao, have become the leading backbone of the Chinese revolution, becoming strong warriors to defend the motherland, build the motherland, and defend world peace. As Commander-in-Chief Zhu said: "The troops of the People's Liberation Army are the schools of youth," the best schools for the Party and Chairman Mao to educate and cultivate the younger generation. This is the reason why Chinese youth particularly love their army and the People's Army is exceptionally concerned about Chinese youth. Here, on behalf of all comrades of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, I would like to express my most sincere and enthusiastic respect to you, and through you to the youth and Youth League members across the country!

　　After the First National Congress of the China New Democratic Youth League, the Central Committee of the Youth League and the General Political Department of the Military Commission, in accordance with the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China's resolution on building the League and Commander-in-Chief Zhu's instructions at the First National Congress of the China New Democratic Youth League, issued a resolution on building the League in the army. In the past four years, the number of Youth League members in the Chinese People's Liberation Army has grown to more than one million, becoming a powerful political organization with a full-army scale led by the Party in the army, playing an active role in completing various construction and war tasks of the army.

　　In order to build a modern national defense army, the youth in the army have achieved tremendous achievements in cultural learning. The famous young Communist Party member Qi Jianhua's "quick literacy method" has been widely promoted throughout the army, basically eliminating illiteracy in the entire army. Following Qi Jianhua's "quick literacy method," Cao Weimin's "quick arithmetic teaching experience," Chang Qing's "quick writing teaching experience," and Zeng Duanyi's "quick writing teaching method" and other creations have successively appeared, making brilliant contributions to the army's cultural education. Due to their active efforts in learning, the cultural level of Youth League members in the army has been greatly improved. A large number of youth have performed meritorious service in cultural learning. Thirty-six percent of Youth League members in the troops of the Central South Military Region have performed meritorious service in cultural learning. After a large-scale cultural learning movement, there have appeared in the army young literary fighters like Gao Yuobao and Cui Bawa, who in the past did not know a few words, but now can write excellent literary works. After mastering the tools of writing and basic calculation skills, the vast number of soldiers of worker and peasant origin have begun to possess the conditions for mastering modern military science and technology and learning political theory, thus setting off a wave of learning military science and technology. Many young soldiers have quickly mastered modern advanced military technology in a short period of time, making our motherland grow new strength. We not only have a strong army, but also a considerable air force and navy and other new military branches, capable of carrying out modern operations with the coordination of various military branches to defend our motherland when encountering enemy aggression.

　　In addition, in the army's tasks of eliminating remnant bandits, suppressing counter-revolutionaries, marching into Tibet, developing border areas, implementing ethnic policies, and participating in national production and construction, the youth have played a vanguard and leading role. Seventy percent of the Youth League members in the troops participating in the Jingjiang flood diversion project performed meritorious service. Among the 307 heroic representatives who attended the National Combat Heroes Congress in 1950, 233 were youth. This all illustrates the great role of youth in the People's Liberation Army in defending and building the motherland.

　　Here, I would also like to mention the great role played by Youth League members and youth in the heroic Chinese People's Volunteers in the just struggle to resist America and aid Korea. The heroic Chinese People's Volunteers, composed of the outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese people, in the struggle to resist American aggressors, aid Korea, and defend the motherland, inherited and carried forward the fine traditions of our people's army. Under the encouragement of slogans such as "Winning Glory for the Motherland" and "Achieving International Merit," they successfully completed various tasks given by the people of the motherland and the leaders of the troops. They defeated the powerful American aggressors and their accomplice troops. The various heroic deeds they created in the struggle to resist aggression, defend the motherland, and defend peace in the East and the world have become a force for promoting the advancement of construction in all aspects of the motherland. Many heroic figures and their deeds have become household names throughout the country and deeply rooted in people's hearts. For example, combat hero and model Youth League member Huang Jiguang is the most outstanding heroic figure after the Five Heroes of Langya Mountain during the War of Resistance Against Japan and Dong Cunrui during the People's Liberation War. Huang Jiguang-style heroic behavior is a model of the combination of patriotism, internationalism, and revolutionary heroism that is growing in our country under the education of Comrade Mao Zedong. It is a new development of the revolutionary heroism of our people. Similarly, Luo Shengjiao, an immortal internationalist fighter, a first-class model of loving the people, and a Youth League member, praised by the people of China and Korea, has become a symbol of the unity and fighting friendship between the people of the two countries. Here, I can also list many youth heroes in various aspects of the Volunteer Army who are admired by the people of the whole country, such as the resourceful and decisive young commanders Guo Zhongtian and Zhou Wenjiang, the immortal "Yang Gensi Hero Company" famous throughout the country, the "Yang Lian Di Company" that made outstanding contributions in repairing railways to support the front line, the female cultural troupe member Jie Xiumei who bravely rescued the wounded under enemy aircraft bombing and strafing and shielded the wounded with her body, and in the youth's Volunteer Air Force there is the air force hero Zhang Jihui who shot down four enemy planes and killed the enemy's air wolf Davis, frightening the enemy, there is the air force hero Zhao Baotong who shot down seven enemy planes and wounded two enemy planes, and there is the air force hero Lu Min who continuously shot down five enemy saber-style jet fighters in twenty days. Among those attending this League Congress alone are: the young blasting hero Huang Jiafu, who continuously completed fifteen blasting missions in one day of battle, annihilated more than 200 enemies, and played a decisive role in the entire battle; there is the young League member Lin Bingyuan, who, after being wounded, rushed into the enemy's formation alone in an emergency situation and annihilated more than 140 enemies; there is the young sharpshooter Zhang Taofang, who killed or wounded 211 enemies with 437 bullets in 31 days of battle; there is the brave, calm, resourceful and flexible 20-year-old air warrior Han Decai, who shot down two enemy planes in his first battle and soon shot down three more enemy planes; there is the young machine gunner Yi Caixue, who blasted four enemy firepower points in 20 minutes in a certain battle in the Shangganling campaign, single-handedly repelled four counterattacks by an enemy company, and used machine guns to eliminate more than 100 enemies; there is the young scout Cai Jintong, who single-handedly covered the retreat of the entire company, fought back the enemy after his left wrist was broken and his abdomen was injured and his intestines flowed out, and climbed back to the position over mountains and waters. The deeds of these heroes fully demonstrate that the just force of Chinese youth in opposing aggression and defending peace can never be defeated. They are worthy of being outstanding sons and daughters of all ethnic groups in China, worthy of being glorious people's soldiers of the Mao Zedong era! Their glory is the glory of the people of all ethnic groups in our country, and also the glory of our Youth League and the youth of the whole country.

　　The reason why the Youth League work in the Chinese People's Army has achieved such great achievements and played such a great role is fundamentally due to the correct and wise leadership of the great Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao. The Party and the leaders of the troops not only patiently educate the young soldiers and Youth League members with Marxism-Leninism, and educate the youth with revolutionary heroism and military discipline, military, political, and cultural scientific knowledge, but also directly lead the activities of the Youth League, making it an important component of political work and a shock force in various tasks of the troops; at the same time, because the Youth League work in the troops can closely combine with the central tasks of the troops and actively play its role as an assistant and reserve force in all aspects, it has been valued by the leaders of the troops and enjoys a high prestige among all soldiers.

　　Dear comrades! Our great motherland's first five-year plan has begun, and the glorious and serious task placed before the people and youth of the whole country is to gradually realize national industrialization and gradually transition from a new democratic society to a socialist society. However, the current economic construction is being carried out under the threat of imperialist war of aggression. U.S. imperialism is still invading Korea, occupying our Taiwan, and actively reviving Japanese militarism, attempting in every possible way to invade our country and threaten world peace. Therefore, while carrying out economic construction, we must continue to strengthen national defense construction. The youth of our country and people from all walks of life jointly shoulder the glorious responsibility of national economic construction, and also shoulder the special responsibility of defending national economic construction, strengthening the modernization of the army, and consolidating national defense, and must be ready at all times to contribute their strength to defending the security and peaceful construction of the motherland, and to defending peace in the Far East and the world. Youth League members and all youth in the Chinese People's Liberation Army must further recognize the serious historical tasks on their shoulders, strive to study Marxism-Leninism and Chairman Mao's works, continuously enhance the spirit of patriotism, internationalism, and revolutionary heroism, strive to study the advanced military science of the Soviet army, exemplarily and accurately execute the troops' regulations, discipline, and orders; carefully cherish the weapons in their hands; continue to continuously improve their military and cultural levels; actively participate in and promote the troops' sports and cultural activities. The Youth League organizations in the troops must make their work more closely aligned with the requirements of regular military training in the troops, give greater play to their role as assistants of the Party, and constantly educate League members to regard striving to study as a practical manifestation of being responsible to the motherland, and make a hundredfold effort to accelerate the modernization and regularization of our army.

　　Dear comrades and friends! At this conference, we heard the extremely valuable instructions of Comrade Liu Shaoqi. All of our comrades must bring the spirit of these instructions to the vast number of youth, to the troops. All comrades of our Chinese People's Liberation Army and all young comrades will join hands more closely with the youth of the whole country, learn from each other, help each other, and jointly strive to implement the resolutions of this conference, and strive to defend our beloved motherland and defend peace in the East and the world!

    在中国新民主主义青年团第二次全国代表大会上
    中央人民政府人民革命军事委员会
    总政治部副主任萧华的祝词亲爱的同志们和朋友们：
    我以无限兴奋和愉快的心情，代表人民革命军事委员会总政治部祝贺中国新民主主义青年团第二次全国代表大会胜利的召开，并向全体代表、各位来宾致崇高的革命敬礼！
    同志们！中国人民解放军和中国青年在中国革命史上历来是血肉相连不可分离的。中国广大青年为了民族与社会的解放，在反对帝国主义和国内反动派的斗争中，成千成万地参加了武装斗争，不屈不挠，前仆后继。在第二次国内革命战争中，中国工农红军绝大多数的成员都是青年，如当时有名的“少共国际师”便是江西根据地一万多名青年所组成的，其中百分之七十以上是中国共产主义青年团团员。年青的红军在粉碎敌人数次围剿，特别是在二万五千里长征中，创造了横渡乌江天险，跨过金沙江，越过大渡河，走雪山，过草地，冲过天险腊子口等英雄事迹，直到陕北抗日的前进阵地。在抗日战争中，千万劳动青年和知识青年，响应了中国共产党抗日救国的号召，洪流般地涌入八路军、新四军，使中国人民的革命力量得到很大的发展。震动中外的平型关大战，敌后八年的抗日游击战争，以及最后配合伟大的苏联军队打败日本法西斯，都是和青年英雄们的英勇斗争分不开的。在伟大的人民解放战争中，大量的青年工人农民和知识分子参加了中国人民解放军或积极地支援了人民解放战争，使中国人民解放军有无穷无尽的力量，歼灭了为美帝国主义所武装和支持的国民党匪军八百零七万人，从而解放了全国大陆。中国人民解放军的青年在这个历史性的胜利中，为祖国建立了不可磨灭的功勋。当全国胜利以后，美国侵略者公开霸占我国台湾，进攻朝鲜，严重威胁我国安全的时候，爱国的青年和青年团员们，热烈地响应了祖国的召唤（单是一九五一年夏季报名参加军事干部学校的知识青年就有三十三万人之多），保证了祖国国防力量不断地增长，支援并争取了抗美援朝斗争的伟大胜利。二十多年来的事实生动地说明：中国人民和中国青年在长期革命斗争中切身体验到“没有一个人民的军队，便没有人民的一切”的真理，因而把支持和参加自己的军队，看成是自己光荣而神圣的任务。中国人民解放军就是在中国人民和中国青年的热烈支援下，从小到大，从弱到强，经历了自己的光荣道路，成为永远不可被战胜的力量。许多参加人民武装斗争的青年在党和毛主席的教养之下，已成为中国革命事业的领导骨干，成为保卫祖国、建设祖国和保卫世界和平的坚强战士。正如朱总司令所说：“人民解放军的部队就是青年的学校”，是党和毛主席教育和培养青年一代的最好的学校。这就是中国青年为什么特别热爱自己的军队和人民军队异常关切中国青年的道理。在这里我谨代表中国人民解放军全体同志向你们，并通过你们向全国的青年和青年团员们表示最诚恳最热烈的敬意！
    中国新民主主义青年团第一次全国代表大会以后青年团中央和军委总政治部根据中共中央建团决议及朱总司令在中国新民主主义青年团第一次全国代表大会上的指示，发布了部队建团的决议。四年来，中国新民主主义青年团在部队中的团员已发展到一百万人以上，成为部队中党所领导的具有全军规模的强大的政治组织，在完成部队各项建设任务与战争任务中发挥了积极的作用。
    为了建设现代化的国防军，部队青年，在文化学习方面获得了巨大的成就。著名的青年共产党员祁建华所创造的“速成识字法”，已在全军普遍推行，使全军从基本上消除了文盲。继祁建华“速成识字法”之后，先后出现了曹卫民的“速成算术教学经验”，常青的“速成写作教学经验”和曾端仪的“速成写字教学方法”等创造，这些创造对部队的文化教育作出了光辉的贡献。部队青年团员由于积极努力学习，他们的文化水平已大大提高。大批青年在文化学习中立了功，中南军区部队中的青年团员有百分之三十六在文化学习中立了功。经过大规模文化学习运动之后，部队中出现了像高玉宝、崔八娃式的过去不识几个字，现在能写长篇的优秀文艺作品的青年文艺战士。广大工农出身的战士在掌握了文字工具和初步计算能力之后，开始具备了掌握现代化军事科学技术和学习政治理论的条件，从而，掀起了学习军事科学技术的热潮。许多青年战士在短短的时间内迅速地掌握了现代化的先进的军事技术，使我们祖国生长了新的力量，我们已不只有一支强大的陆军，也有了相当规模的空军和海军及其他新的兵种，能够在遭遇到敌人侵略时，进行诸兵种协同的现代化作战，来保卫我们的祖国。
    此外，部队在执行消灭残匪、镇压反革命、进军西藏、开发边疆、执行民族政策、参加国家生产建设等任务中，青年都发挥了先锋作用和带头作用。参加荆江分洪工程的部队中青年团员有百分之七十立了功，出席一九五○年的全国战斗英雄代表会议的三百零七名英雄代表中就有二百三十三名是青年。这都说明了人民解放军中的青年在保卫和建设祖国中的伟大作用。
    这里我还要讲到，英雄的中国人民志愿军中青年团员和青年们在抗美援朝正义斗争中所发挥的巨大作用。由中国人民优秀儿女所组成的英雄的中国人民志愿军，在反抗美国侵略者、援助朝鲜，保卫祖国的斗争中，继承和发扬了我国人民军队的优良传统，他们在“为祖国争光”，“立国际功”等口号的鼓舞下，出色地完成了祖国人民和部队首长给予的各种任务。战胜了强大的美国侵略者及其帮凶军。他们在反抗侵略，保卫祖国，保卫东方与世界和平的斗争中所创造的各种英雄事迹，已成为推动祖国各方面建设事业前进的力量；许多英雄人物及其事迹，在全国已家喻户晓，深入人心。如战斗英雄、模范青年团员黄继光，就是继抗日战争时期狼牙山五壮士、人民解放战争时期的董存瑞之后最杰出的英雄人物。黄继光型的英雄行为，乃是我国人民在毛泽东同志教养下正日益增长着的爱国主义、国际主义和革命英雄主义相结合的典范。乃是我国人民革命英雄主义的新发展。同样的，为中朝人民同声歌颂的不朽的国际主义战士，一级爱民模范，青年团员罗盛教，已成为中朝两国人民团结与战斗友谊的标志。这里我还可以列举许多为全国人民所敬仰的志愿军各方面的青年英雄人物，如机智果敢的青年指挥员郭忠田、周文江，闻名全国的不朽的“杨根思英雄连”，抢修铁路支援前线有卓著功绩的“杨连第连”，在敌机轰炸扫射下英勇抢救伤员并以身体掩护伤员的女文工团员解秀梅，在青年的志愿军空军中有击落敌机四架击毙敌人空中老狼戴维斯而使敌人丧胆的空军英雄张积慧，有击落敌机七架击伤敌机两架的空军英雄赵宝桐，有在二十天中连续击落敌人五架佩刀式喷气战斗机的空军英雄鲁珉。单是出席这次团代表大会的就有：在一天战斗中连续完成十五次爆破任务，歼敌二百余人对整个战斗起决定性作用的青年爆破英雄黄家富；有负伤后在战斗紧急的情况下，只身冲进敌阵，消灭敌人一百四十多名的青年团员林炳远；有在三十一天战斗中以四百三十七发子弹打死打伤二百一十一名敌人的青年射击手张桃芳；有勇敢沉着、机智灵活在第一次战斗中击落敌机两架、不久又击落敌机三架的二十岁的空中勇士韩德彩；有在上甘岭战役的某次战斗中，二十分钟内爆破了敌人四个火力点，单人击退敌人一个连的四次反扑，并用机枪消灭一百多个敌人的青年机枪手易才学；有单人掩护全连转移，在左腕打断、腹部受伤肠子流出后，仍按腹奋战打退敌人并翻山过水爬回阵地的青年侦察员蔡金同等人。这些英雄们的事迹，充分地说明了我国青年反对侵略、保卫和平的正义的力量是永远不可被战胜的。他们不愧是中国各民族优秀的儿女，不愧是毛泽东时代光荣的人民战士！他们的光荣就是我国各族人民的光荣，也是我们青年团和全国青年的光荣。
    中国人民军队中的青年团工作所以能够获得如此巨大的成绩和发挥了如此巨大的作用，根本上乃是因为伟大的中国共产党和毛泽东主席正确而英明的领导。党和部队首长不仅耐心地以马克思列宁主义教育青年战士和青年团员，以革命英雄主义和军队纪律素养、军事、政治、文化科学知识教育青年，而且直接领导着青年团的活动，使之成为政治工作一个重要组成部分，成为部队各种工作中的突击队；同时也由于部队青年团的工作能紧紧结合部队的中心任务，从各方面主动发挥自己的助手和后备军的作用，因而受到部队领导的重视，在全体军人中享有很高的威信。
    亲爱的同志们！我们伟大的祖国第一个五年计划已经开始，摆在全国人民和青年面前光荣而严重的任务乃是逐步地实现国家工业化，逐步地由新民主主义社会过渡到社会主义社会。但是，目前的经济建设是在帝国主义侵略战争的威胁下来进行的，美帝国主义仍在侵略朝鲜、霸占着我国的台湾，积极复活日本军国主义，千方百计地阴谋侵略我国，威胁世界和平，因此，我们进行经济建设的同时，就必须继续加强国防建设。我们全国青年和全国各界人民共同担负着国家经济建设的光荣责任，而且还肩负着保卫国家经济建设、加强军队现代化建设以巩固国防的特殊责任，必须随时准备为保卫祖国的安全与和平建设，为保卫远东及世界和平而贡献自己的力量。中国人民解放军中青年团员和全体青年，更要认清自己肩上严重的历史任务，努力学习马克思列宁主义和毛主席的著作，不断地提高爱国主义、国际主义和革命英雄主义精神，努力学习苏联军队的先进军事科学，模范地准确地执行部队的条令、纪律和命令；认真爱护自己手中的武器；继续不断地提高自己的军事水平和文化水平；积极参加与推动部队的体育运动和文化活动。部队青年团的组织，须使自己的工作更加切合部队正规军事训练的要求，更加发挥自己作为党的助手的作用，并时时教育团员，把努力学习看成是对祖国负责的实际表现，百倍努力地加速我军现代化正规化的建设。
    亲爱的同志们和朋友们！在这次大会上我们听到了刘少奇同志的极为宝贵的训示，我们全体同志要把这些指示的精神，带到广大青年中去，带到部队中去，我们中国人民解放军全体同志和全体青年同志将和全国青年一道更紧密地携起手来，互相学习，互相帮助，共同为贯彻这次大会的决议而奋斗，为保卫我们可爱的祖国、保卫东方与世界的和平而奋斗！（新华社）
