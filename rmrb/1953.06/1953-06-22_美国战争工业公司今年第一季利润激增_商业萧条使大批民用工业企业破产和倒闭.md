Xinhua News Agency, New York, 16th (TASS): The "New York Times" reports that in the first quarter of 1953, 585 US manufacturing industrial companies obtained profits of $1.531 billion, an increase of 9% over the same period in 1952. Those industrial sectors that stepped up military production profited even more. For example, ten aircraft companies earned $25.8 million in the first quarter of this year, an increase of more than 80% over the $14.2 million in the first quarter of 1952. The profits of thirty-seven automobile companies increased by 20%; the profits of eleven steel companies increased by 21%; and the profits of thirteen electrical equipment companies increased by approximately 37%. Among the aforementioned electrical equipment companies, Morgan's "General Electric Company" obtained profits of $45.8 million, while in the first quarter of 1952, its profits were $29 million.

Xinhua News Agency, New York, 16th (TASS): American newspapers continue to report on the bankruptcy and closure of enterprises in small and medium-sized industrial cities in the United States due to "reduced commercial activity." New York newspapers admit that Lawrence (Massachusetts), the center of the American wool industry, and Jonestown (Pennsylvania), a large coal mining area, have become cities with large numbers of unemployed workers. Commercial activity in Reedville (Virginia), known as a fishing center, has completely fallen into depression. West Frankfort, one of the major coal mining areas in the United States, is becoming increasingly bankrupt. According to the "New York Times," many mines have closed in recent years, and the operating rates of the remaining mines are also insufficient. West Frankfort's coal production in 1953 will not exceed 3 million tons, a decrease of more than four-fifths compared to last year. The number of people employed in the mines has decreased by about nine-tenths. Some miners come to look for work, but go away empty-handed. According to official materials, there are more than 26,000 unemployed workers in the West Frankfort area. The majority of West Frankfort's residents live in extreme hardship. Of the 150 retail stores that were once thriving, most have closed due to lack of customers. The publisher of the "American" newspaper published in West Frankfort told a "New York Times" reporter: "I feel that many people think that West Frankfort will be buried and forgotten."

    美国战争工业公司今年第一季利润激增
    商业萧条使大批民用工业企业破产和倒闭
    【新华社讯】塔斯社纽约十六日讯：“纽约时报”报道：在一九五三年第一季度内，美国五百八十五个制造工业公司获得了十五亿三千一百万美元的利润，比一九五二年同期多百分之九。那些加紧从事军事生产的工业部门获利更多。例如，十个飞机公司在今年第一季度获利二千五百八十万美元，比一九五二年第一季度的一千四百二十万美元增加了百分之八十以上。三十七个汽车公司的利润增加了百分之二十；十一个钢铁公司的利润增加了百分之二十一；十三个电气器材公司的利润增加了大约百分之三十七。在上面所说的电气器材公司中，摩根的“通用电气公司”所获的利润是四千五百八十万美元，而在一九五二年第一季度它的利润是二千九百万美元。
    【新华社讯】塔斯社纽约十六日讯：美国报纸继续报道美国中小工业城市由于“商业活动减少”而企业破产和倒闭的消息。纽约报纸承认，美国的羊毛工业中心劳伦斯（马萨诸塞州）和大煤矿区琼斯城（宾夕法尼亚州）已变成大批工人失业的城市。被称为渔业中心的里德维尔（弗吉尼亚州）的商业活动完全陷于萧条状态。美国大采煤区之一的西法兰克福日趋破产。据“纽约时报”报道，最近几年以来，许多矿场倒闭了，其余矿场的开工率也是不足的。西法兰克福一九五三年的采煤量将不超过三百万吨，即比去年减少五分之四以上。矿场上就业的人数约减少十分之九。部分来寻找工作的矿工落空而去。据官方材料，西法兰克福地区有二万六千多个失业工人。西法兰克福的大部居民过着极端困难的生活。在一百五十个曾经一度生意兴隆的零售商店中，大部分因为没有顾客而关闭。在西法兰克福出版的“美国人报”发行人向“纽约时报”记者说：“我觉得，许多人认为，西法兰克福将被埋没和遗忘。”
