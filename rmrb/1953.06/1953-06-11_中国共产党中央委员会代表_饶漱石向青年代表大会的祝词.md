Comrades and guests!

On behalf of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, I extend warm congratulations to the Second National Congress of the All-China Youth Federation.

The Communist Party of China and its great leader Comrade Mao Zedong have always been extremely concerned about Chinese youth, and have always regarded Chinese youth as a strong and powerful shock force in the revolutionary and construction undertakings of the Chinese people. Chinese youth possess a tradition and enthusiasm for patriotism, as well as brave and hardworking qualities. During the period of the Chinese People's Revolution and the period of economic recovery after the revolution, Chinese youth, together with the entire Chinese people, exerted their strength, contributed their wisdom, fulfilled their responsibilities, and achieved brilliant accomplishments. All of this proves that Chinese youth are outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese people, worthy of the ardent expectations that our great motherland has always placed on them.

Now, our great motherland has begun to transition from the period of economic recovery to a new historical period of national construction; the new historical task of gradually realizing national industrialization in order to strive for a gradual transition from New Democracy to Socialism has been placed before the people and youth of the whole country.

In order to respond to the call of the motherland, Chinese youth must give play to their initiative and creativity in different posts, and strive to defend the victories and glory of the motherland with an unwavering, vigorous, and fearless spirit, and actively participate in the various constructions of the motherland, and strive to fulfill and overfulfill the national industrial and agricultural production plans.

In order to respond to the call of the motherland, Chinese youth must strive to study the basic theories of Marxism-Leninism, strive to learn various scientific knowledge and various production skills, and train themselves to become national construction talents with a high degree of political consciousness and a specialized skill. Chinese youth must cultivate the noble qualities of being loyal to the motherland, loyal to the people, and loyal to Mao Zedong Thought and cause in the long-term process of learning, and cultivate the fine style of closely linking with the masses, integrating theory with practice, and serving the country and the people wholeheartedly.

In order to respond to the call of the motherland, Chinese youth must closely combine the spirit of patriotism with the spirit of internationalism, and must unite with the youth of the countries of the peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union, as well as the peace-loving youth of all countries in the world, and strive to defend world peace.

Comrades! The above are the basic tasks of Chinese youth in the period of national construction. We firmly believe that in the great construction cause of the motherland, loyal and brave Chinese youth will inherit the glorious tradition of the past and exert their strength even more. We wish you greater victories and glory in uniting the youth of the country to participate in the construction of the motherland.

    中国共产党中央委员会代表
    饶漱石向青年代表大会的祝词亲爱的代表们！来宾们！
    我代表中国共产党中央委员会向中华全国青年第二次代表大会致热烈的祝贺。
    中国共产党和它的伟大领袖毛泽东同志从来是极端关怀中国青年的，从来是把中国青年看做是中国人民革命事业和建设事业中的一支强大而雄厚的突击力量的。中国青年富有爱国主义的传统和热情、勇敢、勤劳的品质。在中国人民革命时期和革命胜利后的经济恢复时期，中国青年和中国全体人民在一起，发挥了自己的力量，贡献了自己的智慧，尽了自己的责任，并获得了辉煌的成就。这一切都证明，中国青年是中国人民的优秀儿女，无愧于我们伟大祖国从来对他们所寄托的殷切希望。
    现在，我们的伟大祖国已经开始由经济恢复时期转入到国家建设的新的历史时期；逐步地实现国家工业化，以争取由新民主主义逐步地过渡到社会主义的新的历史任务，已经提到全国人民和全国青年的面前了。
    为了响应祖国的号召，中国青年必须在不同的岗位上来发挥自己的积极性和创造性，以坚定不移、生气勃勃、不怕困难的精神来保卫祖国的胜利和光荣，来积极参加祖国的各种建设，为争取完成和超额完成国家工农业生产计划而努力。
    为了响应祖国的号召，中国青年必须努力学习马克思、列宁主义的基本理论，努力学习各种科学知识和各种生产业务，把自己锻炼成为具有高度政治觉悟而又有一项专门技能的国家建设人材。中国青年必须在长期的学习过程中培养忠于祖国、忠于人民、忠于毛泽东思想和事业的崇高品质，培养密切联系群众、理论与实践一致、全心全意为国家和人民服务的优良作风。
    为了响应祖国的号召，中国青年必须把爱国主义精神和国际主义精神密切地结合起来，必须和以苏联为首的和平民主阵营各国的青年，以及全世界各国爱好和平的青年团结一致，为保卫世界和平而奋斗。
    同志们！以上这些，就是中国青年在国家建设时期的基本任务。我们深信：在祖国的伟大建设事业中，忠诚而勇敢的中国青年必将继承过去的光荣传统，更大地发挥自己的力量。我们预祝你们在团结全国青年参加祖国建设的工作中获得更伟大的胜利和光荣。
