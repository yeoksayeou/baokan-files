    Readers of this newspaper, upon learning of the U.S. government's outrageous announcement that it would execute the Rosenbergs on June 18th, have written in one after another to protest. The Women Cadres School of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation wrote: The Rosenbergs are an innocent young couple. They are being charged by the U.S. fascist rulers with the crime of "leaking atomic secrets" and are to be executed for the sake of fighting for peace, upholding justice, and pursuing truth. This is clearly a threat to all good people in the United States who are striving for peace. In order to uphold human justice, we unanimously protest the U.S. government's unreasonable decision to kill the Rosenbergs. All the staff of the Beijing Post Office Service Section wrote: "The U.S. government, in order to threaten the peace-loving people of the United States and incite anti-Soviet sentiment, has shamelessly fabricated unwarranted charges to murder the kind, upright, and innocent Rosenbergs. This criminal act has aroused the public outrage of people all over the world. American imperialism has taken the defendant's seat in the court of human justice. In addition to expressing our support and respect for the Rosenbergs' staunch and unyielding struggle, we firmly protest against the U.S. government's murder of them." The signed letter from all the students of the Beijing Foreign Trade College stated: "The United States has completely embarked on the path of fascist militarism. The Rosenberg case is a criminal conspiracy fabricated by the U.S. special agency, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, in collusion with the U.S. judicial organ, the Federal Court, to frame peaceful people. In a country like the United States, all peace-loving people can be killed at any time on trumped-up charges. The Rosenbergs' steadfast and unyielding spirit in the face of threats and inducements shows that the peace-loving people of the world will never be intimidated by the butcher's knife of fascism; on the contrary, this will only accelerate the death of the fascists." All the students of the fourth group of the second class of Beijing College of Political Science and Law wrote: "The Rosenbergs are upright peace fighters in the United States, and they love truth more than their own lives. We demand that the U.S. government revoke its unreasonable verdict to murder the Rosenbergs and release them. We will continue to stand with the people of the world to support the just struggle of the American people." All the students of the Central People's Hospital Nursing School, as well as many staff members of government organizations and citizens of Beijing, wrote in succession, unanimously calling on the just people of the world to take action to stop the crime of the reactionary rulers of the United States in murdering the Rosenbergs.

    本报读者纷纷来信抗议美国政府谋杀罗森堡夫妇
    ——读者来信综述
    本报读者获悉美国政府蛮横宣布于六月十八日处死罗森堡夫妇的消息后，纷纷来信提出抗议。中华全国民主妇女联合会妇女干部学校来信说：罗森堡夫妇是无辜的青年夫妇，他们为了争取和平、坚持正义、追求真理而被美国法西斯统治加以“泄露原子秘密”的罪名，将予处死。这显然是对所有美国争取和平的善良人民的一种威胁。为了坚持人类的正义，我们一致抗议美国政府杀害罗森堡夫妇的无理决定。北京邮局服务科全体职工来信说：“美国政府为了威胁爱好和平的美国人民，煽动反苏情绪，竟卑鄙无耻地捏造莫须有的罪名，以谋杀善良、正直、无罪的罗森堡夫妇，这一罪恶行为已引起全世界人民的公愤。美帝国主义已坐上人类正义法庭的被告席。我们除了对罗森堡夫妇的坚贞不屈的斗争行为表示支援和敬意外，并坚决抗议美国政府对他俩的谋害。”北京对外贸易专科学校全体同学的签名信中说：“美国已经彻头彻尾走上法西斯军国主义的道路了。罗森堡夫妇案件是美国特务机关联邦调查局和美国司法机关联邦法院串通制造的陷害和平人民的罪恶阴谋。在美国这样的国家里，所有的爱好和平的人民随时都会被加以莫须有的罪名而被杀害的。罗森堡夫妇在威胁利诱下所表现的坚贞不屈精神，表明了全世界爱好和平的人民决不会被法西斯主义的屠刀所吓倒的；而这只能加速法西斯主义者的死亡。”北京政法学院第二班第四组全体同学来信说：“罗森堡夫妇是美国正直的和平战士，他们热爱真理甚于自己的生命。我们要求美国政府撤销其谋杀罗森堡夫妇的无理判决，并予以释放。我们将继续和全世界的人民一道，支持美国人民的正义斗争。”中央人民医院护士学校全体同学以及许多机关工作人员、北京市市民等纷纷来信，一致呼吁全世界正义的人民行动起来，制止美国反动统治者杀害罗森堡夫妇的罪行。
