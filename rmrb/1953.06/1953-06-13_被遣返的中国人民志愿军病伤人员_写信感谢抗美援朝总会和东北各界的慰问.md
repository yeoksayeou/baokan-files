Xinhua News Agency dispatch:

    Returned sick and wounded personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army have written letters one after another to thank the General Association for Resisting America and Aiding Korea and the condolence delegation jointly formed by people from all walks of life in the Northeast for their warm condolences.
    A letter from all the sick and wounded personnel in one ward wrote: "You have come from afar to visit us, which made each of our comrades shed tears of gratitude. Everyone said during the discussion: The people of the motherland are really too concerned about us! They take care of us so thoughtfully! We really don't know how to thank the people of the whole country and your concern!"
    Another letter wrote: "We deeply realize that our ability to return victoriously to the embrace of the great motherland is due to the vigorous support of the people of the motherland for the great struggle to resist America and aid Korea, the heroic struggle of the Chinese and Korean People's forces on the front lines, the persistent efforts of our negotiation representatives, and the unanimous support of all peace-loving people in the world. Here, please convey our gratitude. It is they who have rescued us from the enemy's fiery pit."
    A letter from all the sick and wounded personnel in one group said: "It has been more than thirty days since we returned to the embrace of the motherland. We have received the welcome and condolences from people from all walks of life, and we have also received many letters and gifts of condolences. The nurses take care of us at all times, afraid that we will feel a little uncomfortable. We deeply realize that only in our own lovable motherland can we have such happiness and such warmth."
    A letter from the sick and wounded Huang Qiusheng wrote: "Comrades of the condolence delegation, please tell the people of the motherland that we will never forget the concern of the people of the motherland. At the same time, we will never forget the enemy's abuse and persecution of us. … Although my leg is disabled, my hands, mouth, and mind are not disabled. As long as I can live, I will actively work for the revolutionary cause."

    被遣返的中国人民志愿军病伤人员
    写信感谢抗美援朝总会和东北各界的慰问
    【新华社讯】被遣返的中国人民志愿军病伤人员，纷纷写信感谢中国人民抗美援朝总会和东北各界人民联合组成的慰问团对他们热情的慰问。
    一个病室的全体病伤人员的信上写道：“你们不远千里到这里来慰问我们，使我们每个同志感激得流下泪来。大家在座谈时都说：祖国人民对咱们实在太关心啦！照顾得太周到啦！我们真不知道要怎样感谢全国人民和你们的关怀才好呢！” 
    另一封信上写道：“我们深刻的认识到，我们能够胜利的回到伟大祖国的怀抱，是由于祖国人民积极支援抗美援朝的伟大斗争，由于中朝人民部队在前线的英勇斗争，由于我方谈判代表的坚持努力，以及全世界一切爱好和平人民一致声援的结果。在这里，请你们转达我们的谢意。是他们使我们脱离了敌人的火坑。”
    一个病组的全体病伤人员的信上说：“我们重回祖国怀抱已有三十多天了。我们得到了各界人民的欢迎和慰问，我们也收到了许多慰问信和慰问品。护士同志时刻照顾我们，生怕我们有一点不舒服。我们深刻体会到，只有在我们自己可爱的祖国里，才有这样的幸福，才有这样的温暖。”
    病伤人员黄秋生的信上写道：“慰问团同志们，请你们转告祖国人民吧，我们对祖国人民的关怀是永远不会忘记的。同时，我们更不会忘掉敌人对我们的虐待和迫害。……我的腿虽然残废了，但我的手、嘴和思想并没有残废，只要我能活着，我就要积极为革命事业工作。”
