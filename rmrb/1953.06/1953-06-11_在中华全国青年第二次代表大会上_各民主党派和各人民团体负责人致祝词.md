    At the Second National Congress of the All-China Youth Federation
    Addresses by Heads of Democratic Parties and People's Organizations
    At the opening ceremony of the Second National Congress of the All-China Youth Federation, the heads of various democratic parties and people's organizations spoke successively, extending warm congratulations to all the delegates attending the congress and wishing the congress a complete success.
    Li Jishen, Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, said: The convening of the Second National Congress of the All-China Youth Federation marks the great unity of the nation's youth. The delegates attending this congress include youth from all ethnic groups, social strata, democratic parties, religions, overseas Chinese, and street communities, possessing extremely broad representation. This illustrates the extensive unity of our nation's youth. More importantly, I believe it shows that there is a vast number of young people nationwide who must strengthen their learning, transform their thinking, raise their political awareness, and strive for progress. We should learn from the Communist Party members, learn from the Youth League members, and strive to be good students of Chairman Mao. The nation's youth should actively participate in national construction, bringing into play their maximum enthusiasm and creativity. The nation's youth should unite closely around the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese New Democratic Youth League, forming a strong and effective united front of youth. Not only that, we should also unite with the democratic youth of the world and fight to defend world peace.
    Zhang Bojun, Vice Chairman of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League, said: Excellent and heroic Chinese youth have made glorious contributions in the history of the Chinese revolution. Especially in the three years since liberation, under the leadership of the Chinese working class and its vanguard, they have demonstrated great strength and achieved extremely glorious accomplishments on all fronts of revolutionary work. But today, the century of the people demands that our youth shoulder even greater tasks. At the same time, the new country and the new society have prepared all the superior conditions for our work. As long as we are united and possess the determination to serve the people wholeheartedly, everyone can contribute their abilities and exercise their wisdom. I wish the nation's youth to continue to carry forward the glorious tradition since the May Fourth Movement and advance victoriously under the banner of Mao Zedong.
    Huang Yanpei, Chairman of the China Democratic National Construction Association, said: To meet the expectations of the era for youth, learning must be our primary task: learning from the Soviet Union; learning advanced science and technology; learning revolutionary theory; learning current affairs and policies; learning excellent revolutionary qualities and work styles. Whether on the battlefield, in the classroom, in factories, or in mines, we must learn tenaciously. Young comrades! From now on, emit your heat and light, just like the sun, and create your own bright and grand future with your own strength, which is also the bright and grand future of the new country.
    Lai Ruoyu, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, in his address, highly praised the contributions of Chinese young workers to the construction of the motherland. He said: The broad masses of young workers, engineering and technical personnel, staff members, and all workers, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, have displayed a high degree of patriotic enthusiasm, devoting all their energy to creative labor. Among the 223,000 national model workers, advanced producers, and model workers, 50,000 are young workers. They work hard to study technology, actively learn from advanced Soviet experience, overcome many difficulties in production, and play a pioneering role. Starting with Zhao Guoyou, a lathe operator who advocated new production records, there successively appeared Hao Jianxiu, the creator of the fine yarn working method; Zheng Xikun, the leader of the over-axis 500-kilometer movement; Huang Runping, the creator of the new warehouse management method; Guo Xiuyun, the creator of the new long-distance telephone switchboard method; Peng Songfu, the creator of the lathe crash course teaching method; Gu Faming, the creator of the new record for sinking coal mine shafts; Wei Ya, a young technician who created the top-blown alkaline converter steelmaking method; and Lin Qi-gui, a young technician who created the large air volume slag quick copper smelting method. They are all advanced figures among the youth, all innovators on the industrial production front. The broad masses of Chinese youth, under the education of the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese New Democratic Youth League, are developing their talents and wisdom, learning to master modern science and technology, and becoming a strong shock force in national construction. Young comrades, the tasks we face are glorious and great. We firmly believe that the broad masses of youth will enthusiastically participate in the national construction cause and stand at the forefront of the construction cause.
    Shi Liang, Vice Chairman of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, pointed out in her address: In the past four years, like the male youth of all ethnic groups and sectors of the country, the female youth of all ethnic groups and sectors have also participated in various tasks of building the motherland. They are full of confidence, actively learn, overcome difficulties, learn skills, and make achievements, setting an example for male and female youth, and also opening up a glorious path for women in New China. However, due to the deep-rooted historical traditions of feudalism over thousands of years that have shackled women, some young women themselves still retain more or less feudal remnants in their thinking. Therefore, when our Women's Federation and youth organizations mobilize the masses of youth to participate in national construction, they must pay attention to doing a good job in the work of young women, strengthen the education of young women, care for and encourage their progress, and help them overcome difficulties on the road ahead.

    在中华全国青年第二次代表大会上
    各民主党派和各人民团体负责人致祝词
    在中华全国青年第二次代表大会开幕典礼上，各民主党派、各人民团体的负责人先后讲话，向参加大会的全体代表致热烈的祝贺，预祝大会的胜利成功。
    中国国民党革命委员会主席李济深说：中华全国青年第二次代表大会的召开，标志着全国青年的大团结。出席这次大会的代表包括各民族、各阶层、各民主党派和宗教、华侨、街道各方面的青年，是具有极广泛的代表性的。这一方面说明我们全国青年的团结是很广泛；另一方面，更重要的，我以为这正说明全国还有广大的青年群众必须加强学习，改造思想，提高政治觉悟，努力争取进步。我们应该向共产党员学习，向青年团员学习，人人争取做毛主席的好学生。全国青年应该积极地参加国家建设，发挥最大的积极性和创造性。全国青年应该紧密地团结在中国共产党和中国新民主主义青年团的周围，形成坚强有力的青年统一战线，不但如此，我们还应该与全世界的民主青年团结在一起，为保卫世界和平而斗争。
    中国民主同盟中央委员会副主席章伯钧说：优秀的英勇的中国青年，在中国革命历史上曾经有过光辉的贡献，特别是在解放后的三年多来，在中国工人阶级及其先锋队的领导下，在各种革命工作战线上，都曾发挥了伟大的力量，获得了极其光辉的成就。可是今天，人民的世纪，要求我们青年担负更多更大的事业；同时，新的国家、新的社会又为我们准备好了一切工作的优越条件，只要我们团结一致，具备全心全意为人民服务的决心，每一个人都可以各尽所能地去发挥自己的智慧。祝全国青年继续发扬“五四”以来的光荣传统，在毛泽东的旗帜下胜利前进。
    中国民主建国会主任委员黄炎培说：为了满足时代对青年的期望，学习就不能不是我们的首要任务：学习苏联；学习先进的科学技术；学习革命理论；学习时事政策；学习优秀的革命品质和工作作风。不论在战场上，教室里，工厂和矿山中，我们必须顽强地学习。青年同志们！从此发出你们和太阳般同样的热，同样的光，靠自己的力量创造出自己的锦绣般的远大前程，也就是新国家的锦绣般的远大前程。
    中华全国总工会主席赖若愚在致词中对中国青年工人在祖国建设中的贡献予以极大的赞扬，他说：广大的青年工人、工程技术人员、职员和全体工人一起，在中国共产党的领导下，发挥了高度的爱国主义热情，以全副精力从事着创造性的劳动。在全国二十二万三千名劳动模范、先进生产者、模范工作者当中，就有五万是青年工人。他们努力钻研技术，积极学习苏联先进经验，克服了生产中许多困难，发挥了先锋作用。从车工赵国有倡导生产新纪录开始，陆续地出现了细纱工作法的创造者郝建秀，满载超轴五百公里运动的带头人郑锡坤，新仓库管理法的创造者黄润萍，新的长途电话接线法的创造者郭秀云，车工速成教学法的创造者彭松福，开凿煤矿竖井新纪录的创造者谷发明，创造面吹碱性转炉炼钢法的青年技术人员魏亚，创造大风流渣快速炼铜法的青年技术人员林其梖等人物。他们都是青年中的先进人物，都是工业生产战线上的革新者。广大的中国青年在中国共产党和中国新民主主义青年团的教养下，都在发展自己的才能和智慧，学习掌握现代科学技术，成为国家建设中的一支坚强的突击力量。青年同志们，我们面临的任务是光荣而伟大的。我们完全相信，广大青年必将踊跃参加国家建设事业，站在建设事业的最前线。
    中华全国民主妇女联合会副主席史良在致词中指出：四年来，和全国各族各界的男青年们一样，全国各民族、各界的女青年们也参加了建设祖国的各种工作，她们充满信心，积极学习，战胜了困难，学会了本领，做出了成绩，给男女青年们树立了榜样，同时也给新中国妇女开辟了光辉的道路。但是，由于数千年来封建的历史传统对妇女束缚太深，部分女青年本身也还残存着或多或少的封建残余思想。因此我们妇联和青年团体在发动青年群众参加国家建设时，必须注意做好青年妇女工作，加强对青年妇女的教育，关心和鼓励她们的进步，帮助她们克服前进道路上的困难。（新华社）
