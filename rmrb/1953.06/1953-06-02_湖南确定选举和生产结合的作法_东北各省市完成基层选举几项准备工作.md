Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, June 1st: The Hunan Provincial Election Committee held a joint conference of chairpersons of election committees from all counties, cities, and the Xiangxi Miao Autonomous Region from May 25th to 29th to study specific issues in grassroots elections and formulate a preliminary plan for grassroots election work throughout the province.

The conference focused on discussing how to closely integrate grassroots election work with production. The conference pointed out that grassroots election work must be closely integrated with production from beginning to end, and all practices that hinder production are not allowed. Therefore, publicity activities, population surveys, voter registration, and other tasks must be carried out under the principle of facilitating the masses and production. The conference pointed out that the next three months are a tense stage of flood prevention and drought resistance in rural areas, which is the busiest time for agricultural production in Hunan. Therefore, the specific arrangements for grassroots election work should be based on the agricultural production season in various places, making use of the gaps in agricultural production, such as some areas making preparations for elections while making preparations for flood prevention before the arrival of the flood season; concentrating on flood prevention during the flood season; and then carrying out election work after the flood season.

Regarding the deployment of grassroots election work, the conference decided to divide it into three stages: the first is the preparation stage (to be completed before the end of June); the second is to fully launch the population survey and voter registration (to be completed before July 20th); and the third is the election stage (August to October). The main tasks in the preparation stage are to allocate and train cadres, and to widely carry out publicity on the general election. During this stage, each county is required to hold the following meetings: the county election committee; a joint meeting of key cadres from counties and districts and chairpersons of township election committees; a people's representative conference of all sectors in the county; a conference of publicity representatives; a conference of technical cadres; and a meeting of activists of township and village cadres. These meetings will be used to carry out publicity and mobilization among the vast number of cadres and masses. At the same time, during this stage, each county is required to do a batch of pilot projects to gain experience.

Currently, the Hunan Provincial Election Committee has transferred 150 cadres from provincial-level agencies to assist in pilot projects in various counties and cities. More than 44.3 million copies of population survey registration forms, voter registration forms, voter certificates, etc., produced by the Provincial Election Committee have all been printed and distributed to counties and cities in the province. The publicity team of the Provincial Election Committee Office will convene publicity and publishing agencies to discuss and formulate a publicity plan for the general election.

According to Xinhua News Agency: Provinces and cities in the Northeast region have completed several preparatory tasks for grassroots elections. The grassroots election work plans for all six provinces and five cities in the region have been formulated, and some provinces and cities have made specific arrangements for grassroots election work.

All provinces and cities attach great importance to training cadres and pilot projects. Many key personnel participating in the general election in various provinces and cities have already completed training. The first batch of more than 630 guiding cadres and technical cadres trained by five provinces and cities including Heilongjiang, Liaoxi, and Luda have all been put into pilot project work. The pilot projects carried out by Heilongjiang Province in eight villages and one town in Zhaodong, Hailun, Longjiang, and Baicheng counties have ended, and experiences are now being summarized. The work of Shenyang City to concentrate on training 4,390 cadres will begin in early June. The Election Committee Office of the city is conducting pilot projects for population surveys and voter registration in two representative streets, respectively, preparing to gain preliminary experience before carrying out a region-wide pilot election in the southern urban area in mid-June.

Some provinces and cities have made relatively adequate preparations for the publicity work of the general election. Liaoxi, Luda, and other provinces and cities have formulated publicity work plans. Heilongjiang Province has also compiled speeches for propagandists and drawn many publicity materials such as propaganda posters and slides. Fushun City held a representative meeting of propagandists with more than 1,000 participants on May 26 to deploy publicity work. In addition, the Northeast People's Art Theater, Northeast Opera Research Institute, Northeast Conservatory of Music, Northeast Academy of Fine Arts, Northeast People's Publishing House and other units have also formulated plans to cooperate with the publicity of the general election.

    湖南确定选举和生产结合的作法
    东北各省市完成基层选举几项准备工作
    【新华社长沙一日电】湖南省选举委员会从五月二十五日到二十九日召开全省各县、市和湘西苗族自治区选举委员会主席联席会议，研究基层选举中的各项具体问题，订出了全省基层选举工作的初步计划。
    会议着重讨论了基层选举工作如何与生产密切结合的问题。会议指出：基层选举工作必须自始至终密切结合生产进行，所有妨碍生产的作法都是不能允许的。因此，宣传活动、人口调查、选民登记等工作，必须在便利群众、便利生产的原则下进行。会议指出：今后三个月正值农村中防汛抗旱紧张阶段，是湖南农业生产上最忙的时间。因此，在基层选举工作的具体安排上，应根据各地农业生产季节情况，利用农业生产的空隙时间进行，如有些地区在防汛工作尚未到来前，一面做好防汛准备工作，一面做好选举准备工作；汛期到来后，即全力防汛；汛期结束后，再进行选举工作。
    关于基层选举工作的部署，会议决定大体分为三个阶段：第一是准备阶段（六月底以前完成）；第二是全面展开人口调查与选民登记（七月二十日以前完成）；第三是选举阶段（八月到十月）。在准备阶段中的主要工作是调配和训练干部，广泛展开关于普选工作的宣传。在这一阶段中，要求各县开好下列几个会议：县选举委员会；县、区主要干部和乡选举委员会主席联席会；县各界人民代表会议；宣传员代表会；技术干部会和乡、村干部积极分子会。通过这些会议在广大干部和群众中进行宣传和动员。同时，在这一阶段中，要求各县做好一批典型试办的工作，取得经验。
    现在，湖南省选举委员会已在省级各机关中抽调一百五十名干部，分赴各县、市协助进行典型试办工作。省选举委员会赶制的人口调查登记表、选民登记表、选民证等共四千四百三十多万份已全部印好，分发到省内各县、市。省选举委员会办公室的宣传组将召集各宣传、出版机关，讨论和制订关于普选的宣传计划。
    据新华社讯：东北区各省、市已完成基层选举的几项准备工作。全区六省五市的基层选举工作计划已全部订出，有些省、市具体布置了基层选举工作。
    各省、市都极重视训练干部和典型试办工作。很多省、市参加普选的骨干已经训练完毕。黑龙江、辽西、旅大等五个省、市第一批训练的六百三十多名指导干部和技术干部，已全部投入典型试办工作。黑龙江省在肇东、海伦、龙江、白城四县的八个村和一个镇进行的典型试办工作已经结束，现在正在总结经验。沈阳市集中训练四千三百九十名干部的工作将在六月上旬开始。该市选举委员会办公室正在有代表性的两个街道分别进行人口调查和选民登记的典型试办工作，准备取得初步经验以后，再于六月中旬在南市区进行全区规模的试办选举工作。
    有些省、市对普选的宣传工作已做了较充分的准备。辽西、旅大等省、市已订出宣传工作计划。黑龙江省并编写了宣传员讲话和绘制了宣传画、幻灯片等许多宣传品。抚顺市在五月二十六日召开了拥有一千多人的宣传员代表会议，布置了宣传工作。此外，东北人民艺术剧院、东北戏曲研究院、东北音乐专科学校、东北美术专科学校、东北人民出版社等单位也先后订出了配合普选宣传的计划。
