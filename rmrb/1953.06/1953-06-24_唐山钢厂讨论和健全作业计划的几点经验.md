    Several Experiences of Tangshan Steel Plant in Discussing and Improving Operation Plans
    Dai Mingyu, Director of Tangshan Steel Plant

    Tangshan Steel Plant began to compile monthly operation plans in July 1951. In July 1952, each workshop established instruction charts for workshops, teams, and groups, and organized production according to daily progress. This initially overcame the chaotic phenomenon in production and ensured that various major products could be delivered on time according to contract requirements and complete or exceed the monthly production tasks. However, due to the lack of understanding of the important role of operation plans and balanced production by leaders at all levels in the past, there were many shortcomings in the compilation and implementation of operation plans, so it was still impossible to achieve balanced production and comprehensively fulfill the national production plan.
    After participating in the factory director and mine manager meeting of the Ministry of Heavy Industry in March this year, we deeply realized that the main reason for the previous loose-tight production, quality fluctuations, and frequent accidents was the lack of a scientific planning and management system. On the one hand, our operation plan still had many shortcomings, and on the other hand, we lacked a sound production scheduling mechanism, forcing leading cadres to personally solve some specific problems, falling into bureaucratism, neglecting one thing while attending to another, and being busy and passive. Starting from early April, we combined mobilizing the masses to discuss the plan, organized a special group to improve the operation plan, summarized the implementation of the operation plan in the past two years, and proposed the methods and steps to improve the operation plan. At the same time, we enriched the scheduling system. In early May, on the basis of discussing the plan, we entered the stage of discussing and improving the operation plan in a planned and step-by-step manner. After the work started, through learning, mobilization, and a combination of top-down from the factory to the workshop and bottom-up inspection and discussion of the implementation of the operation plan and instruction charts, all employees realized the importance of improving the operation plan and strengthening scheduling work for organizing balanced production and ensuring the completion of the plan. They further exposed and revealed the shortcomings in this regard in the past and put forward many improvement methods. In this process, symposiums were held separately for production and business departments, and enlarged factory affairs meetings were held to introduce the experience of the steelmaking department in implementing instruction charts. Various workshops also exchanged experiences with each other, which provided favorable conditions for improving the compilation, implementation, and inspection system of operation plans and instruction charts. Based on the shortcomings revealed in the discussion and the opinions put forward by the employees, we organized special personnel to analyze and study, revised the content of the existing instruction charts, and finally, after review, determined the compilation, implementation, and inspection system of the operation plan and workshop instruction charts and the production scheduling responsibility system. We mobilized the masses to discuss and compile the June operation plan according to the new system and earnestly implement it.
    The following experiences were gained in this discussion and improvement of the operation plan:
    1. The combination of the leadership's systematic summary of work from top to bottom and the masses' bottom-up exposure and inspection to discover weak links is an important basis for improving the operation plan.
    This discussion of the operation plan started with summarizing the work. We comprehensively and systematically summarized the implementation of the operation plan in the past two years, affirmed the achievements, and at the same time identified the problems existing in the compilation and implementation of the operation plan, and proposed preliminary improvement methods. Then, we reported to the cadres and workers at each level and mobilized the masses to conduct in-depth discussions and further expose and inspect. According to the leadership's summary and the masses' inspection, the main problems existing in the operation plan are as follows: First, the compilation of the operation plan is not thorough and does not conform to reality. Some indicators are not accurate and are not combined with the actual production situation. For example, last year, the casting department's steel casting tasks exceeded the operation plan by an average of 32% per month, and the highest even exceeded 105%. In March of this year, the rolling department's quota for rolling 12mm round steel was set at 129 tons per day, but the highest daily output in that month only reached 117 tons, and generally only about 100 tons. This shows that some indicators are not accurate, either too high or conservative. The same is true for workshop instruction charts. For example, the converter team workers in the steelmaking department reflected: "The instruction chart stipulates that the blowing time is 45 minutes regardless of the age and capacity of the furnace, and does not consider the slag cleaning time." The pig iron furnace workers reflected: "The dispatcher instructs to repair the pig iron furnace, but does not instruct to dismantle the furnace. How can the furnace be repaired if it is not dismantled?" The cadres of the rolling department said in the discussion: "The operation plan itself is not scientific. It schedules one hour of roll changing time every day, but it is not actually the case. Sometimes, it is easy and pleasant to complete the task without changing the rolls, but it is impossible to complete the task when changing the rolls." At the same time, the operation plan lacks thorough consideration of production conditions during compilation, so problems cannot be solved immediately when they occur temporarily. For example, in the first quarter of this year, the steel casting variety could not be completed month after month because the wooden patterns and sandboxes and other tools were not well coordinated. The workshop sometimes did not have wooden patterns, and sometimes it had wooden patterns but no sandboxes. Secondly, because the technical work and management work are separated from the operation plan, the plan cannot be technically guaranteed as it should be. Often, the variety task is affected by poor product quality. For example, the chain ring made by the casting department has not been delivered after a year. The failure of the plan to be combined with management work also affects production. For example, in the first quarter of this year, the slow resolution of labor problems restricted the improvement of the molding capacity of the refractory materials department. In addition, the lack of initiative in technical supply and improper equipment maintenance also directly or indirectly affected the implementation of the plan. Through the leadership's summary and the masses' inspection, we grasped the above situation and found the key to the problem, which provided an important basis for improving the operation plan. Therefore, in improving the operation plan, we paid attention to selecting and calculating correct technical indicators, fully considered various balancing tasks, such as product sales balance, raw material balance, production capacity balance between internal processes of the workshop, power and transportation balance, etc., strengthened the initiative of technical supply and the planning of equipment maintenance, studied technical organization measures to ensure the completion of the plan, established a complete system for the compilation, implementation, and inspection of the operation plan, enriched the scheduling mechanism, and established a responsibility system for production scheduling to ensure the implementation and realization of the operation plan.
    2. To do a good job in the operation plan and ensure the effective implementation of the system, there must be a solid mass base.
    Our previous operation plans were only mastered by a few cadres and could not penetrate the masses, so there was a certain degree of formalism for a long time. In this discussion of the operation plan, opinions from all aspects were widely absorbed. First, the implementation of the operation plan of each workshop was thoroughly inspected, and symposiums were held for functional departments to study how to cooperate and how to serve the operation plan and production. For example, the business department discussed material supply and product ordering, and the production department exchanged methods of planning, execution, and inspection. At the same time, the workers' opinions on improving the operation plan and instruction chart were adopted. For example, the workers in the rolling department proposed that the instruction chart should include the preparation of the rolls to ensure that production is carried out in a planned manner; the workers in the casting department proposed that the allocation of wooden samples, drawings, and sandboxes should be included in the instruction chart to better carry out production. In the discussion, some workers also criticized their past departmentalism and conservative ideas. For example, in order to catch up with tasks, the workers in the rolling department delayed changing rolls when they should, which caused losses to the use of rolls and the quality of steel. Some workers in the molding class of the refractory materials department criticized their own ideas of leaving a hand when estimating work hours, and tried to estimate low when reporting and estimated as much as possible for others. We synthesized the above opinions and formulated a system for the compilation, implementation, and inspection of production operation plans. In terms of plan compilation: the general dispatching office starts to compile the next month's operation plan on the 15th of each month based on the annual plan, order varieties, quantity, and detailed technical conditions, the technical situation of the main production equipment, the allocation of labor and the technical conditions of workers, the existing inventory of raw materials, semi-finished products, and machine spare parts, necessary maintenance work, and the advanced experience that emerged in the previous stage. After the initial completion of the plan, the production and technology section will carefully review the plan content of each workshop on the 21st, give technical corrections, and propose technical organization measures to ensure the completion of the plan, solicit opinions from the workshop and functional departments respectively, and finally, after review and approval, issue an order from the factory director for implementation before the 26th; then each workshop will convey the next month's plan content to the workers in the workshop according to the operation plan, announce various measures and plans, and put forward specific guarantees for completing the operation plan, so that all employees know the plan content and how to complete it. In terms of plan execution: in order to implement and ensure the completion of the plan, the workshop dispatching team compiles a daily production instruction chart according to the provisions of the operation plan, submits it to the workshop technical team for technical review, and approves it by the workshop director, and issues it for implementation after obtaining the consent of the general dispatching office, and organizes production on a daily and shift basis. In terms of plan inspection: the factory has established a daily production scheduling meeting (attended by the workshop director, the plan dispatching team leader, and the heads of relevant functional sections) to check the production situation of each workshop the day before, study and solve existing problems, and has established a system for checking the implementation of the plan every ten days and every month. The workshop checks the implementation of the plan of each shift through the daily party, government, labor union, and youth league meeting; the shift or group checks the implementation of the plan the day before through the daily pre-shift and post-shift meeting, and clarifies the production task of the day. In this way, the operation plan is truly mastered by the masses and becomes the action program of all employees.

       3. To ensure the implementation of the operation plan and instruction chart, there must be a strong dispatching mechanism to play its guarantee and supervision role. In the past, due to the weak dispatching force, unclear responsibilities of dispatching personnel, and chaotic work, they were busy all day long, lacked foresight, so they often only carried out contact dispatching after problems occurred, and passively solved problems behind them, but could not prevent problems from occurring from a positive perspective. This is also because the dispatching mechanism lacked a systematic understanding of the reserve and supply of major raw materials, equipment maintenance, etc. in the past, so it was difficult to create good conditions for production, and it could not point out the shoals on production in advance. For example, in July 1952, the steelmaking department lacked spare parts for the worm gear, and it could not be replaced in time when it was broken, which caused production to stop. In December of the same year, the plan for the refractory materials department's brick blanks was not completed due to insufficient supply of mold frames. These problems fully show that without a strong dispatching work, it cannot play the role of guaranteeing and supervising production; on the other hand, it will inevitably increase the burden on the leadership. In this discussion, we accepted the past experience and lessons, strengthened the dispatching work, and emphasized the importance of the dispatching work so that it has the authority to do its job. However, some departments still lack understanding of the important role of the dispatching mechanism. Some departments believe that accepting the supervision of the dispatching mechanism is weakening their authority, and some people doubt whether the daily dispatching meeting is necessary, etc. The emergence of these ideas shows that in the future, it is necessary to carry out necessary ideological struggles in the process of implementing the operation plan, and education should be carried out among all employees constantly to overcome departmentalism and liberalism and vigorously support the dispatching mechanism. Only in this way can the guarantee and supervision role of dispatching work on the implementation of the operation plan be fully played.
    The shortcomings of this discussion of the operation plan are: because the time is not sufficient, the factory-level leading cadres' guidance to the workshop is not specific enough, the study, discussion, and inspection of the operation plan are not in-depth enough, and the political work is not well coordinated, so the understanding of the importance of the operation plan is not profound enough among some employees, and the operation plan system and dispatching work system itself are not perfect enough. This requires the factory-level leading cadres to further study and research from practice in the future, the workshop leading cadres should further discuss the system of relevant production instruction charts and how to play the functions of the workshop plan dispatching team, and implement the operation plan into routine work. This is a long-term and important task for the factory-level and workshop leading cadres, and in particular, the operation plan system and production scheduling system should be further enriched and improved through the central work of opposing no one being responsible and establishing a responsibility system in June, July, and August, so that production can always be maintained in balance, and on the basis of balanced production, the product quality can be further improved and the cost can be reduced, and the enterprise level can be improved one step further.

    唐山钢厂讨论和健全作业计划的几点经验
    唐山钢厂厂长　戴明予
    唐山钢厂自一九五一年七月就开始按月编制作业计划，一九五二年七月各车间并建立了车间、班、组的指示图表，按日进度组织生产，初步克服了生产上的混乱现象，保证了各种主要产品能按照定货合同的要求如期交货和按月完成或超额完成生产任务。但是，由于过去各级领导对于作业计划和均衡生产的重要作用认识不足，编制作业计划和执行时存在许多缺点，因而还不能作到均衡生产和全面地完成国家生产计划。
    今年三月我们参加重工业部厂矿长会议后，深刻体会到过去在生产上所以前松后紧，质量波动，事故频繁，其主要原因，是由于缺乏一套科学的计划管理制度。一方面我们的作业计划还有很多缺点，另一方面又缺乏健全的生产调度机构，迫使领导干部亲自去解决一些具体问题，陷于事务主义，顾此失彼，忙乱被动。从四月上旬开始，我们结合发动群众讨论计划，组织了健全作业计划的专门小组，总结了两年来作业计划执行情况，提出了健全作业计划的方法、步骤，同时充实了调度制度。五月初，在讨论计划的基础上有计划、有步骤地进入讨论与健全作业计划的阶段。工作开始后，通过学习、动员以及由厂到车间自上而下与由下而上相结合地对过去执行作业计划和指示图表情况的检查和讨论，使全体职工认识了健全作业计划和加强调度工作对组织均衡生产保证完成计划的重要意义，进一步揭发和暴露了过去在这方面存在的缺点，并提出了不少改进办法。在此过程中，又分别召开了生产和经营部门的座谈会，召开了扩大的厂务会议，介绍了炼钢部执行指示图表的经验，各车间并互相交流经验，这就为改善作业计划和指示图表的编制、执行和检查制度提供了有利条件。根据讨论中揭发的缺点和职工提出的意见，我们组织专人分析研究，对现行指示图表的内容重新加以修正，最后经过审查，确定了作业计划与车间指示图表的编制、执行和检查制度及生产调度责任制度，并按新的制度发动群众讨论与编制六月份作业计划，认真贯彻执行。
    此次讨论与健全作业计划中获得如下几点经验：
    一、领导方面从上而下地有系统地总结工作与发动群众自下而上地进行揭发检查相结合，发现薄弱环节，是健全作业计划的重要依据。
    这次讨论作业计划是从总结工作入手，我们全面地系统地总结了二年来作业计划执行情况，肯定了成绩，同时找出了在作业计划的编制与执行上所存在的问题，并提出了初步的改进办法，然后逐层向干部和工人进行报告，发动群众深入讨论，进一步揭发检查。根据领导方面的总结和群众的检查，在作业计划上存在的问题主要有以下几个方面：首先是作业计划的编制不周密，不切合实际，有些指标不准确，没有与实际生产情况相结合。如去年铸造部铸钢任务平均每月超过作业计划百分之三十二，最高竟超过百分之一百零五。轧钢部今年三月份轧十二公厘。元钢产量定额每日规定为一百二十九吨，但该月最高日产量仅达到一百一十七吨，一般的只在一百吨左右。这说明了有些指标不够准确，不是过高，就是保守。车间指示图表同样如此，如炼钢部转炉组工人反映：“指示图表不管炉子新老，容量大小，一律指示吹炼时间为四十五分，也不考虑清渣时间。”化铁炉工人反映：“调度员指示化铁炉修炉，但不指示拆炉，炉子不拆怎么修炉？”轧钢部干部在讨论中说：“作业计划本身不太科学，每天排上一小时的换轧辊时间，但实际不是那样，有时不换轧辊倒轻松愉快地完成任务，要换轧辊倒完不成任务。”同时在编制作业计划时对生产条件缺乏周密考虑，因此临时发生问题不能立即得到解决。如今年第一季度铸钢品种月月不能完成，其原因是木样和砂箱等工具配合得不好，车间有时没有木样，有时有了木样却没有砂箱。其次由于技术工作和管理工作与作业计划脱节，计划不能得到应有的技术保证，往往由于产品质量不好影响了品种任务的完成，如铸造部所制的练子环，做了一年还没交货。计划与管理工作不结合也影响生产，如今年第一季度由于劳动力问题迟迟未解决，限制了耐火材料部成型能力的提高。此外，技术供应工作主动性不够，设备维护不当等也都直接间接地影响了计划的贯彻。通过领导方面的总结和群众的检查，我们掌握了上述情况，找出了问题的关键所在，这就给健全作业计划提供了重要依据。因此我们在健全作业计划中注意选择并计算正确的技术指标，充分考虑各项平衡工作，如产销平衡，原材料平衡，车间内部工序间生产能力的平衡，动力、运输的平衡等，加强技术供应的主动性和设备检修的计划性，研究保证完成计划的技术组织措施，建立完整的作业计划的编制、执行和检查制度，充实调度机构，建立生产调度的责任制度，以此来保证作业计划的贯彻实现。
    二、搞好作业计划，保证制度的切实贯彻，必须有坚实的群众基础。
    我们过去的作业计划，只为少数干部所掌握，不能深入群众，因之很长时期存在着某种程度的形式主义。在这次讨论作业计划过程中，广泛地吸取了各方面的意见，首先深入地检查了各车间作业计划执行情况，并召开了职能部门的座谈会，研究如何配合，如何为作业计划服务，为生产服务。如经营部门讨论了材料供应，产品订制等，生产部门交换了计划的编制、执行和检查的方法等，同时采纳了工人对于改进作业计划和指示图表的意见。如轧钢部工人提出指示图表应把轧辊的准备工作包括进去，以保证生产有计划地进行；铸造部工人提出木样、图纸、砂箱的调配应编入指示图表，以便使生产更好地进行。在讨论中有些工人并批判了自己过去存在的本位主义和保守思想。如轧钢部工人为了赶任务，该换轧辊时，拖延不换，对轧辊使用和钢材质量都有损失。耐火材料部成型班有的工人批判了自己估工时有留一手的思想，自报时尽量估低，对别人尽量多估等等。我们综合了以上各个方面的意见，制定了生产作业计划的编制、执行和检查制度。在计划的编制方面：总调度室根据年度计划，订货品种，数量及详细的技术条件，主要生产设备的技术情况，劳动力的调配和工人的技术条件，现有的原材料、半成品及机器备件等的库存情况，必要的检修工作，上一阶段出现的先进经验等资料，于每月十五日开始编制下月作业计划；计划初步编制完竣后，生产技术课于二十一日对各车间的计划内容详细审核，并给以技术上的修正，提出保证完成计划的技术组织措施计划，分别征求车间和职能部门的意见，最后经过复审、批准，于二十六日前以厂长命令颁布执行；然后各车间根据作业计划向本车间职工群众传达下月计划内容，宣布各项措施计划并提出完成作业计划的具体保证，使全体职工对计划内容及如何完成都心中有数。在计划的执行方面：为了贯彻并保证计划的完成，车间调度组根据作业计划的规定，每日编制生产指示图表，交车间技术组在技术上予以审核，由车间主任批准，并取得总调度室的同意后，颁布执行，按日按班组织生产。在计划的检查方面：全厂建立了每日一次的生产调度会议（车间主任与计划调度组长以及有关职能课负责人参加），检查前一天各车间生产情况，研究与解决存在的问题，并建立了每旬每月的检查计划执行情况的制度。车间则通过每日的党、政、工、团碰头会检查各班计划执行情况；班或小组则通过每日的班前班后会议检查前一天计划执行情况，明确当日生产任务。这样，作业计划就真正被群众所掌握，成为全体职工的行动纲领。
       三、要使作业计划及指示图表贯彻执行，必须有强有力的调度机构，发挥其保证和监督作用。过去由于调度力量薄弱，调度人员职责不清，工作混乱，终日忙忙碌碌，缺乏预见，因此往往只能在问题发生后才进行联系调度，消极地在问题后面解决问题，而不能从积极方面来预防问题的发生。这也是由于调度机构过去对主要原材料的储备、供应情况，设备检修等缺乏系统的了解，因此也就很难为生产创造良好条件，不能预先指出生产上的暗礁。例如一九五二年七月炼钢部蜗母轮缺乏备件，坏了不能及时更换，曾造成停产，同年十二月份因型框供应不足。使耐火材料部砖坯计划没有完成。这些问题充分说明了没有强有力的调度工作就不能起到保证和监督生产的作用；在另一方面也必然给领导方面增加负担。这次讨论中我们接受了过去的经验教训，加强了调度工作，强调调度工作的重要性使其有职有权。但是有的部门对调度机构的重要作用，仍然认识不足。有的部门认为接受调度机构的监督是削弱了自己的职权，有的人怀疑每天的调度会议是否有必要等等。这些思想的产生说明了今后在贯彻作业计划的过程中还需要进行必要的思想斗争，应经常不断地在全体职工中进行教育，克服本位主义、自由主义，大力支持调度机构。只有如此，才能充分发挥调度工作对贯彻执行作业计划的保证和监督作用。
    这次讨论作业计划的缺点是：由于时间不够充分，厂级领导干部对车间的指导不够具体，对作业计划的学习、讨论、检查作的不够深入，政治工作没有很好地配合，因此在某些职工中对作业计划的重要性认识还不深刻，作业计划制度和调度工作制度本身还不够十分完善。这就要求今后厂级领导干部应从实践中进一步地学习研究，车间领导干部应进一步地讨论有关生产指示图表的制度和如何发挥车间计划调度组的职能，把作业计划贯彻到经常工作中去。这是厂级和车间领导干部的长期重要任务，特别应在六、七、八月份通过反对无人负责、建立责任制的中心工作，把作业计划制度和生产调度制度更加充实与改进，使生产经常能够保持均衡，并在均衡生产的基础上进一步提高产品质量，降低成本，将企业水平提高一步。
