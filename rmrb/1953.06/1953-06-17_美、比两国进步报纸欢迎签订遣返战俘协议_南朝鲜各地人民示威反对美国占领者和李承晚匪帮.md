Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, June 16th: The American progressive newspaper "People's World" published an editorial on June 10th entitled "Turn Armistice into Peace," welcoming the agreement reached at Panmunjom on the issue of prisoner of war repatriation, considering it an encouraging and significant piece of news. The editorial stated that once the Korean armistice is realized, "it marks the failure of the policy that opposes peaceful coexistence with the Soviet Union and China and relies on atomic bombs and superior strength to force the world to submit to American will. The end of this war with peace negotiations points the way to peace everywhere in the world."
The editorial stated: "Following the Korean armistice, successful peace conferences must be held. This conference will create conditions for the peaceful resolution of Far East issues, including allowing China to join the United Nations. With the realization of peace in Korea, peaceful negotiations must be held with the Soviet Union in order to resolve all disputes at the conference table."
The editorial concluded by calling on the American people to continue their efforts and struggle to ensure the effective implementation of the Korean peace negotiation agreement.
Xinhua News Agency, Prague, June 16th: The Belgian "Red Flag" published an editorial on June 9th, expressing the joy of the Belgian working people at the agreement reached on the issue of prisoner of war repatriation.
The editorial stated: "The Soviet Union, Beijing, and Pyongyang governments have consistently advocated resolving the Korean War through negotiations rather than by force, and this agreement is an important result of their unwavering policy."
The editorial stated: All peace-loving people around the world believe that the agreement reached at Panmunjom specifically proves that no war today cannot be ended through negotiations.
The editorial stated: "Today's events show how just this struggle—the struggle for peace—is, how bright the future of peace is in Korea and even the world, and how necessary it is to expand the great struggle to defend humanity's most precious peace cause."
Xinhua News Agency, June 16th: "L'Humanité" journalist Pierre Courtade reported from Kaesong: Just as the staff officers of both sides are rushing to complete the final details before the signing of the armistice agreement, some very significant things have happened in Korea in recent days.
The movement launched by Syngman Rhee to drive South Koreans to demonstrate and demand continued fighting has had a serious counter-effect. Initially, apart from a small number of school-age children, South Koreans refused to participate. However, Syngman Rhee's police in Seoul, Busan, and other cities forced each household to send at least one representative to participate in "spontaneous" demonstrations. The people's response was to use this rare opportunity to turn the demonstrations into anti-American, and later anti-Syngman Rhee demonstrations. The headquarters of the U.S. Eighth Army was attacked, the residences of American journalists were broken into, American police outposts were attacked, dozens of Syngman Rhee's police were beaten, several were seriously injured, and one of Syngman Rhee's cabinet ministers was severely beaten. Demonstrators carried thousands of signs, extremely common in Europe, that read "Yankee, Go Home." Syngman Rhee was very frustrated by the reversal of events and immediately banned further demonstrations, announcing that anyone who participated in marches again would be subject to "severe punishment."
South Korean newspapers used these days of anti-American "total freedom" to publish shocking atrocities such as American police slashing female students with razors and beating people with sticks. Now Syngman Rhee is demanding that the newspapers no longer record such events, and murmurs that the Americans responsible for these events should be arrested. In these days, the South Korean people have been able to express their hatred for the American occupiers and puppet police who "protect" them.

    美、比两国进步报纸欢迎签订遣返战俘协议
    南朝鲜各地人民示威反对美国占领者和李承晚匪帮
    【新华社柏林十六日电】美国进步报纸“人民世界日报”六月十日以“使停战变为和平”为题发表社论，欢迎板门店达成的关于战俘遣返问题的协议，认为这是使人鼓舞的重大消息。社论说：朝鲜停战一旦实现，“它标志着反对与苏联、中国和平共处并且依靠原子弹和优势力量来强迫全世界服从美国意旨的这种政策的失败。这场战争以和平谈判而结束，就为世界一切地方指出了通向和平的道路。”
    社论说：“继朝鲜停战之后，必须举行成功的和平会议。这次会议将为和平解决远东问题，包括让中国加入联合国问题在内创造条件。随着朝鲜和平的实现，必须要与苏联举行和平谈判，以便在会议桌上解决一切纠纷。”
    社论最后号召美国人民继续努力，为争取朝鲜和平谈判协议的切实执行而奋斗。
    【新华社布拉格十六日电】比利时“红旗报”在六月九日发表社论，表示比利时劳动人民对战俘遣返问题获得协议的喜悦。
    社论说：“苏联、北京和平壤政府一贯主张用谈判而不是用武力方式来解决朝鲜战争，这次的协议就是它们这种坚定不移的政策的重要成果。”
    社论说：全世界爱好和平的人民都认为，在板门店取得的协议具体地证明了今天没有一个战争是不能通过谈判来终止的。
    社论说：“今天的事态说明：这个斗争——争取和平的斗争——是多么具有正义性，朝鲜以至全世界和平的前途是多么光明，并且多么需要扩大保卫人类最宝贵的和平事业的伟大斗争。”
    【新华社十六日讯】巴黎“人道报”记者贝却敌自开城报道：正当双方参谋人员在赶紧完成停战协定签订前的最后细节的时候，最近几天，在朝鲜发生了一些极有意义的事情。
    李承晚所发动的驱策南朝鲜人进行示威，要求继续打下去的运动，起了严重的反效果。最初，除了少数学龄儿童外，南朝鲜人都拒绝参加。但是李承晚的警察在汉城、釜山和其他城市中强迫每户人家至少派一个代表去参加“自发的”示威。人民的答复是利用了这个难得的机会把示威变成反美国的，后来又是反李承晚的示威。美国第八军总部受到了袭击，美国记者住所被侵入，美国警察岗哨受到了袭击，有几十个李承晚的警察遭到殴打，有几个还受了重伤，有一名李承晚的内阁部长遭到痛打。游行者拿着成千幅在欧洲极为普遍的“美国佬，滚回去”的标语牌。李承晚对事情的逆转甚为沮丧，立即禁止再举行示威，并宣布任何人再参加游行，将受“严厉惩罚”。
    南朝鲜报纸利用了这几天反美国的“一切自由”的机会，刊载了美国警察用剃刀乱砍女学生，用棍子打人等惊人的暴行。现在李承晚要求各报不要再记载这样的事件，而且嘴里小声叽咕着：对这些事件负责的美国人应加以逮捕。南朝鲜人民在这几天是能够对保护他们的美国占领者和傀儡警察表示一下憎恨的情绪。
