    Xinhua News Agency, Fuxin, June 24th. The construction of the Fuxin Haizhou Open-Pit Mine has received significant assistance from Soviet experts, enabling the entire project to be completed not only two years ahead of the original schedule but also expanding the mine's recoverable coal reserves and saving a substantial amount of investment.
    The Haizhou Open-Pit Mine's stripping work was originally carried out using the design of Japanese engineers. In 1951, Soviet experts came to the mine and reviewed the original design, proposing a new development plan. According to this new plan, the Haizhou Open-Pit Mine could use new mining methods to fully utilize equipment efficiency, expanding the open-pit area by 3.72 square kilometers compared to the original design, and greatly increasing the recoverable coal reserves. With this new plan and the large-scale arrival of new Soviet mechanical equipment and transportation tools, the Haizhou Open-Pit Mine began large-scale construction in June 1951. Because the entire stripping process was mechanized, by the end of June this year, the expected stripping volume will exceed the design requirements by 91.04 percent, and railway laying will exceed it by 3 percent, ensuring completion two years ahead of the old design and handover for production on "July 1st" this year.
    The design made by Soviet experts for the Haizhou Open-Pit Coal Mine demonstrates technical advancement, political foresight, and economic savings in every aspect. The mine's spoil ground was originally planned to be located in the north of the mine, which would hinder the development of Fuxin's municipal construction and was technically unreasonable. Soviet experts changed it to the south of the mine, which not only saved 169 billion yuan in spoil ground investment, but also allowed the spoil ground to be used for agricultural production after the open-pit mine was mined out, and the entire mine would become a beautiful artificial lake. In terms of transportation lines, the new design adopted a circular reversing wiring method, so that the laying of 300 kilometers of railway in the vast 12-square-kilometer mine would not cause conflicts even if vehicles traveled back and forth once a minute, which is in line with scientific facilities and ensures safe operation. Coal mining process and transportation traffic signals, etc., will also be mechanized and automated to minimize physical labor.
    Throughout the construction process of the open-pit mine, Soviet experts provided in-depth on-site guidance, playing a significant role in ensuring project progress, quality, and the cultivation of technical personnel. Soviet experts frequently came to the mine to guide the formulation of various operation charts and specific operations, and conducted multiple inspections of the entire project. May and June of this year were the most intense stages of preparing the open-pit mine for handover to production. After in-depth inspection, Soviet experts helped change the slow progress of the main project—the two culvert projects—and went deep into the site for more than ten consecutive days, guiding the project day and night in the rain and wind. In order to help the mine's cadres improve their technical level, Soviet experts also frequently lectured on technical theory or made special reports to them. The construction project of the Haizhou Open-Pit Coal Mine is progressing at a rapid pace under the selfless assistance of Soviet experts and the enthusiastic labor of all the staff on the construction site.
    Xinhua News Agency, Fuxin, June 24th. The construction project of the Fuxin Haizhou Open-Pit Coal Mine, which is preparing for handover to production, has been completed, and the trial operation of the vehicles is in good condition.
    In the past two days, construction has been concentrated on the mid-open-pit line relocation, the connection of six turnouts in the spoil ground, and the connection lines between the stripping station and the spoil ground. Although the rain was continuous, the more than 2,000 workers on the construction site were in high spirits and launched a race to accelerate completion. Local Young Pioneers teams, women, literary and art work troupes, Peking Opera troupes, and government cadres all formed慰问 teams to come to the construction site to express their regards, encouraging the workers to push the project forward faster.
    Now, the lighting, signal, telecommunications, and line equipment prepared for the handover to production in the open-pit mine have been properly arranged; the mile markers and gradient marker bases have been engraved with bright red five-pointed stars; electric shovels, locomotives, self-dumping trucks, etc., have also been given a bright new look. The workers, who have worked hard for more than two years, are welcoming the official handover to production day—July 1—with victorious joy.

### 在苏联专家帮助下提前两年完工  阜新海州露天矿建设工程“七一”移交生产

    在苏联专家帮助下提前两年完工
    阜新海州露天矿建设工程“七一”移交生产
    【新华社阜新二十四日电】阜新海州露天矿的建设工程，得到了苏联专家的重大帮助，使整个工程不但比旧设计提前两年完成，而且扩大了煤的可采量，节省了大量投资。
    海州露天矿的剥土工程原来是采用日本工程师的设计进行的。一九五一年，苏联专家来矿审查了原来的设计，提出了新的开发方案。根据这个新方案，海州露天矿可以使用新的开采方法，充分发挥设备效能，露天范围比原设计扩大了三点七二平方公里，煤的可采量也大大增加。有了这个新方案和苏联新式机械设备和运输工具的大批运到，海州露天矿才在一九五一年六月开始了大规模的建设。因为全部剥土工程机械化，到今年六月底，预计剥土量将超过设计要求百分之九十一点零四，铁道铺设将超过百分之三，保证了比旧设计提前两年完工，在今年“七一”移交生产。
    苏联专家帮助海州露天煤矿所作的设计，处处表现了技术上的先进，政治上的远见和经济上的节省。该矿的排土场原计划设在矿的北部，这样将妨碍阜新市政建设的发展，技术上也不合理；苏联专家把它改设在矿的南部，不但节省了排土投资一千六百九十亿元，而且露天矿采完以后，排土场仍可进行农业生产，整个矿场将成为优美的人造湖。在运输线路方面，新设计采用循环折返式的配线方法，使得宽广十二平方公里的矿场内铺设三百公里长的铁路，车辆每分钟来往一次也不致发生冲突，既合乎科学设施又保证了安全作业。采煤过程和运输交通信号等，也都将实行机械化自动化，体力劳动将缩小到最小限度。
    在整个露天矿的建设过程中，苏联专家深入现场指导，对保证工程进度、质量和培养技术力量，都起了重大作用。苏联专家经常来矿指导制订各种作业图表和具体操作，并对全部工程作过多次检查。今年五、六月是露天矿准备移交生产的最紧张的阶段，苏联专家在深入检查后，帮助改变了主要工程——两个涵洞工程的进度迟缓现象，并一连十几天深入现场，夜以继日地冒着风雨在工地指导工程进行。苏联专家为了帮助该矿干部提高技术水平，还经常向他们讲解技术理论或作专题报告。海州露天煤矿的建设工程就是在苏联专家的这种无私的援助和工地全体职工的热情劳动下，以飞跃的速度向前进展的。
    【新华社阜新二十四日电】阜新海州露天煤矿准备移交生产的建设工程已全部完工，车辆试行运转的情况良好。
    最近两天来，工程建筑集中在露天中部线路改道、排土场六个道岔接道、剥离站和排土场连接线路等处进行。虽然雨水连绵，工地上两千多工人都精神焕发，展开了加速完工的竞赛。当地的少年儿童队、妇女、文艺工作团、京剧团和机关干部们，都组成慰问队到工地来慰问，鼓励着工人将工程更快地推向前进。
    现在，露天矿里为移交生产准备的照明、信号、电讯和线路设备已经安排妥当；里程标、坡度标底座已刻上鲜红的五星；电铲、机车、自翻车等也换上了漆亮的新装。辛劳了两年多的工人们正以胜利的欢欣，迎接着正式移交生产的日子——七月一日。
