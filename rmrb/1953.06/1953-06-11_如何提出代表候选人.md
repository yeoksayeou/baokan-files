    How to Nominate Representative Candidates
    Wang Shui
    One of the most significant signs reflecting the democratic essence of elections is the question of how representative candidates are nominated.
    In the "Election Law of the National People's Congress and Local People's Congresses of the People's Republic of China" (hereinafter referred to as the "Election Law"), there are two very important provisions regarding the nomination of representative candidates:
    Article 47: Candidates for representatives to the National and local People's Congresses shall be nominated according to electoral districts or electoral units.
    The Communist Party of China, all democratic parties, people's organizations, and voters or representatives not belonging to the aforementioned parties and organizations may jointly or individually nominate lists of representative candidates according to electoral districts or electoral units.
    Article 49: When local People's Congresses elect representatives to higher-level People's Congresses, the candidates for representatives are not limited to the representatives of that level of People's Congress.
    These two articles outline several principles regarding the nomination of representative candidates in the new election system:
    (1) Representative candidates are nominated according to electoral districts or electoral units. The so-called "electoral district" mainly refers to the electoral areas delineated during grassroots elections. Article 53 of the Election Law stipulates: "Elections of representatives to the People's Congresses of townships, towns, municipal districts, and cities without districts shall be conducted in several areas divided according to the voters' residence, and election meetings shall be held separately." "Electoral units" include two meanings: First, it refers to the election of representatives to the People's Congresses at the county level and above by the People's Congresses at the next lower level (as stipulated in Article 3 of the Election Law). Therefore, the administrative unit that elects representatives to the People's Congress at the higher level is also the "electoral unit" of the higher-level People's Congress. For example, Beijing is one of the "electoral units" of the National People's Congress. Second, the People's Armed Forces, overseas Chinese, and various ethnic minorities may conduct elections separately (Articles 7 and 32 of the Election Law). Therefore, for the People's Armed Forces, overseas Chinese, and ethnic minority representatives who are elected separately in the People's Congresses at all levels, the units that conduct separate elections for them are also called the "electoral units" of the respective level of People's Congress. For example, the Hebei Provincial Military District is one of the "electoral units" of the Hebei Provincial People's Congress. The nomination method according to electoral districts and electoral units is a significant feature of the leap from the people's representative conferences to the People's Congress. Because the previously implemented organizational rules of the people's representative conferences stipulated that administrative heads were natural organ representatives, and that parties and organizations could select and send representatives, and invite representatives through consultation – although these rules stipulated the method of generating representatives, which was completely necessary in the past – this method inevitably affected some limitations in the nomination of representative candidates. According to the new provisions of the Election Law, in the future, when parties, organizations, or voters (representatives) nominate lists of representative candidates, they should submit them to the election committee in the grassroots units – townships, towns, municipal districts, and cities without districts – according to their respective electoral districts or units (Article 39 of the Election Law); when local People's Congresses elect representatives to the People's Congress at the higher level, they should submit them to the presidium chairing the meeting (Article 54). This provision for the nomination of representative candidates reflects the further improvement of the people's democratic system and the further promotion and guarantee of the people's democratic rights.
    (2) Parties, organizations, and individual voters or representatives have the same right to nominate representative candidates; in terms of nomination methods, they can jointly nominate or nominate individually. For example, Article 13 of the Organizational Law of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference stipulates that one of the functions of the National Committee is to "consult and propose a joint list of candidates from the units participating in the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference in the election of representatives to the National People's Congress," which is a method of "joint nomination"; another example is that when Daming County, Hebei Province, held the county's People's Representative Conference, which exercised the functions of the People's Congress, in the election of members of the Standing Committee and government members, because representatives came from various places and were not very familiar with people from other districts or sectors, there was difficulty in nominating candidates. Therefore, it was decided that the nominations would be made from the bottom up by groups, with each person nominating and introducing the people they wanted to elect, attaching a resume, and submitting it to the conference for evaluation by all representatives. After careful deliberation and discussion, the final election took place, and everyone felt "excited and satisfied." This is an example of individual nomination. Regarding the two different nomination methods, the masses have concluded: "Bottom-up nomination is democratic, top-down nomination is comprehensive." Therefore, "the best nomination method is a combination of bottom-up and top-down." We believe that this conclusion is basically correct (but just top-down nomination does not hinder its democratic nature). Therefore, the provisions of the Election Law regarding the nomination of representative candidates mainly absorb and summarize past experiences and promote them, and then fix them with law. Some people have also worried: If there are no restrictions on individual nominations, will the result be an "excessive number of candidates"? This is also possible; however, the method of discussion and evaluation in groups currently adopted in elections in various places will gradually tend to be more concentrated, and therefore should not be restricted. But at the same time, we should also recognize that in theory, joint and organized nomination methods are superior to individual nomination methods, and therefore the former should be used more in practice (the method proposed after group discussion embodies collective significance). However, the right of individual nomination is one of the main ways to protect individual democratic rights, and it is also the consistent principle of "taking care of the minority" in our people's democratic system. Therefore, prescribing it without any restrictions is also the inevitable logical result of our democratic election law.
    (3) The scope of those nominated as representative candidates is not limited to representatives of People's Congresses at all levels. This provision generally includes two meanings: First, some people may possess the qualifications of representatives to the higher-level People's Congress, but are not representatives of the local People's Congress. For example, recently some responsible comrades in local areas have been transferred to work in the central government, but they have high prestige in the local area and among the masses, and the masses believe that they deeply understand the actual situation in the local area and can reflect their opinions and requirements. Therefore, they are willing to nominate them as candidates for representatives to the National People's Congress elected in that local area. Should we restrict this kind of nomination? I don't think we should restrict it. Second, the scope of representative candidate nomination is, in theory, also an aspect of the voters' right to nominate. Because they not only have the right to nominate any voter as a representative candidate, but even if they have not nominated, they also have the right to elect any other voter they want to elect (Article 51 of the Election Law), and are not bound by the list of representative candidates. This is another manifestation of the democratic breadth of our Election Law. Because only unrestricted nomination can more fully exercise the people's democratic rights.
    From the above points, we can see two distinct characteristics of the Election Law's provisions on the nomination of representative candidates: First, it very clearly indicates a leap in the people's democratic dictatorship system from people's representative conferences at all levels to the People's Congress. It has changed some transitional methods of a cross-sectoral and temporary nature, and adopted principles that truly conform to the principle that "People's Congresses at all levels are produced by the people of all nationalities using universal suffrage"; but at the same time, it has absorbed some mature experiences of the people's representative conferences and some methods that are popular with the masses, and has fixed them by law. Therefore, it conforms to China's actual situation and is supported by the broad masses of the people. Second, it implements the spirit of maximizing democracy. It has no stipulations with "attached conditions" and cumbersome procedures like those in bourgeois countries. As Vyshinsky said when discussing the Soviet election system regarding the right to nominate candidates, there are no restrictions, so it can become a "real democratic right, which in fact guarantees that all citizens are attracted to participate in responsible political work."

    如何提出代表候选人
    王水
    体现选举的民主实质最显著的标志之一，是代表候选人如何提出的问题。
    在“中华人民共和国全国人民代表大会及地方各级人民代表大会选举法”（以下简称选举法）上，关于代表候选人的提出问题，有两条很重要的规定：
    第四十七条    全国和地方各级人民代表大会的
    代表候选人，均按选举区域或选举单位提出之。
    中国共产党、各民主党派、各人民团体和不属于
    上述各党派、团体的选民或代表均得按选举区域
    或选举单位联合或单独提出代表候选人名单。
    第四十九条    地方各级人民代表大会选举上级
    人民代表大会代表时，其代表候选人不限于各该
    级人民代表大会之代表。
    这两条条文，规划了新的选举制度中关于提出代表候选人的几项原则：
    （一）代表候选人按照选举区域或选举单位提出。所谓“选举区域”，主要是指基层单位选举时所划的选区。选举法第五十三条规定：“乡、镇、市辖区和不设区的市人民代表大会代表之选举，得按选民的居住情况划分若干区域，分别召开选举大会进行之。”“选举单位”则包括两个内容：第一、是指县、设区的市以上各级人民代表大会代表，由其下一级人民代表大会选举（按选举法第三条的规定），因此，选举出席上一级人民代表大会代表的行政单位，亦即上一级人民代表大会的“选举单位”。譬如北京市便是全国人民代表大会的“选举单位”之一。第二、人民武装部队、国外华侨及各少数民族均得单独进行选举（选举法第七条、第三十二条），因此，凡在各级人民代表大会中，有单独选举的人民武装部队、华侨及少数民族代表，对其单独进行选举的单位，亦称之为各该级人民代表大会的“选举单位”。譬如河北省军区，便是河北省人民代表大会的“选举单位”之一。按照选举区域与选举单位的提名办法，是由各界人民代表会议跃进到人民代表大会的一个显著特征。因为过去施行的各界人民代表会议组织通则中，曾规定有行政首长为当然机关代表，党派、团体自行选派代表及协商、特邀代表的办法，它虽然规定的是代表产生办法——这种办法在过去是完全必要的——，但此种办法必然会影响到在代表候选人提名上的若干局限性。按照选举法新的规定，今后无论党派、团体、或选民（代表）提出代表候选人名单时，在基层单位——乡、镇、市辖区及不设区的市，均应按其所属选举区域或单位，向选举委员会提出（选举法第三十九条）；地方各级人民代表大会选举上一级人民代表大会代表时，则是向主持大会的主席团提出
    （五十四条）。这种代表候选人提名的规定，就反映着人民民主制度的进一步完备，人民民主权利的进一步得到发扬与保障。
    （二）对于代表候选人，党派、团体与个体的选民或代表，都同样有提名权；在提名方式上，可以联合提出，也可以单独提出。譬如中国人民政治协商会议组织法第十三条关于全国委员会职权中，就规定一项“协商并提出参加中国人民政协的各单位在全国人民代表大会代表选举中的联合候选名单”，便是一种“联合提出”的办法；又如河北省大名县召开代行人民代表大会职权的县各界人民代表会议，在选举常务委员会和政府委员时，由于代表来自各地，对不是本区、本界的人不太了解，发生候选人提名困难的问题，因此确定先由小组由下而上的提，各人提出并介绍自己愿选的人，附上简历，送交大会由全体代表品评，经过慎重酝酿讨论，最后选举，大家都感到“兴奋、满意”。这便是个人单独提名的事例。对于两种不同的提名方法，群众曾有过结论说：“自下而上提名民主，自上而下提名全面”，因此，“提名方式最好是自下而上与自上而下相结合”。这种结论我们认为基本是正确的（但只是由上而下提名，也并不妨害其民主性）。因而选举法中关于代表候选人提名的规定，也主要是吸取、总结了过去的经验并加以发扬，而后用法律把它固定下来。有人也曾顾虑：对于个人提名不加任何限制，其结果是否会造成“候选人数额过多”？这也是有可能的；但目前在各地选举中所采用的经过小组讨论、评比的办法，是会逐渐趋于集中的，因而不应有所限制。但同时我们也应该承认：在理论上，联合的、组织的提名方式，是优越于单独的、个体的提名方式的，因而在实践中应更多采用前者（经由小组讨论而后提出的办法，即是包涵有集体意义的）。但是个人提名权是保障个人民主权利的主要方式之一，也是我们人民民主制度中一贯地“照顾少数”的原则精神，因此不加限制地把它规定下来，也正是我们民主选举法的必然逻辑结果。
    （三）被提名为代表候选人的范围，不限于各级人民代表大会代表。此项规定，大体上包括有两种涵义：第一、可能有些人具备着上级人民代表大会代表的条件，但又非当地人民代表大会代表，譬如最近有些地方上的负责同志调来中央工作，但他在地方上、群众中威信很高，群众认为他深刻了解地方上实际情况，能够反映其意见与要求，因此愿意提他为该地方上选举出席全国人民代表大会代表的候选人。对于此种提名，我们是不是应加以限制呢？我认为不应加以限制。第二、代表候选人提名的范围，从理论上讲，也是选民提名权的一个方面。因为他们不仅有权提名任何选民为代表候选人，而且即使未曾提名，也还有权选举自己愿选的其他任何选民（选举法第五十一条），而不为代表候选人名单所束缚、拘限。这又是我们选举法民主广度的一个表现方面。因为只有不加任何条件限制的提名，才可以更充分地发挥人民民主的权利。
    从以上几点我们可以看出选举法关于规定代表候选人提名的两点鲜明特色：第一、它极为显明地表示了人民民主专政制度从各级人民代表会议到人民代表大会的一个跃进。它改变了各界性的、临时性的若干过渡办法，而采用了真正符合于“各级人民代表大会由各民族人民用普选方法产生”的原则；但同时它又吸取了各界人民代表会议一些成熟的经验和群众喜闻乐用的若干办法，并以法律加以固定。因此，它是符合于中国实际情况的，是为广大人民群众所拥护的。第二、它贯彻了极大限度地发扬民主的精神。它丝毫没有资产阶级国家那些“附带条件”与繁琐手续的规定。正像维辛斯基论述苏联选举制度中关于候选人提名权时所说的，没有任何限制，因此它才能成为一种“真实的民主权利，事实上保证全体公民都被吸引参加负责的政治工作。”
