Fuxin Ping'an Shaft Sinking Project Completed 70 Days Ahead of Schedule

    The shaft sinking construction project of Fuxin Mining Bureau's mechanized new-type shaft, Ping'an Shaft, was completed on June 22, 70 days ahead of the state plan. This project, which would take three to four years to complete in capitalist countries like Britain and the United States, has now been completed in less than a year, meeting the requirements of good, fast, economical, and safe. Currently, the entire shaft is about to begin the construction of underground level roadways.

    The construction of Ping'an Shaft received significant assistance from Soviet experts. Since the shaft sinking project began in July of last year, Soviet experts have successively offered many suggestions related to accelerating the project's progress and improving quality. While implementing the experts' suggestions, the workers also creatively adapted them to their own conditions. For example, an important issue in shaft sinking was building a wall seat. In this regard, Soviet experts introduced the method of using a spigot-type hanging platform to create the foundation. Due to insufficient on-site conditions, the workers, based on the spirit of the Soviet experts' suggestions, developed a method for building wall seats at high altitudes, overcoming the difficulties and increasing actual working time. In terms of rock drilling, the Gu Faming advanced group, based on the method of using long drill rods proposed by Soviet experts, improved the drill rods, enlarged the drill bit heads, and researched deep-hole drilling techniques, thus creating a record of drilling 3.5 meters per day. The Soviet experts' suggestion of double-bucket hoisting greatly accelerated the speed of rock extraction. In March, the shaft construction workers created a new record of 74.28 meters of progress in a month. In April of this year, the shaft sinking encountered conglomerate and water-bearing layers. Thanks to the implementation of new measures proposed by Soviet experts, this obstacle was overcome, and in May, a new national record of 80.56 meters of progress per month was created.

Tiancheng Railway Track Laid to Guanghan

    The Tiancheng Railway had its tracks laid to Guanghan County, more than 38 kilometers from Chengdu, on June 21. To commemorate the first anniversary of the commencement of construction, the people between Chengdu and Guanghan will solemnly hold the opening ceremony of the Chengdu-Guanghan section on "July 1st."

    The track laying and bridge construction work of the Tiancheng Railway began in Chengdu on April 27 of this year. For more than fifty days, the workers fought day and night against the floods, rapidly erected 23 bridges, and enabled the tracks to be laid to Guanghan Station on time. In the track laying work, due to the workers' conscientious implementation of the "Four No's Covenant" of "no laying if the sleeper is not square, no hammering if the spike is not straight, no laying if the track gauge is incorrect, and no laying if the tie plate is not straight," the quality of the track laying project was greatly improved.

Extinguishing the Underground Fire in the Datong Coalfield

    The fire extinguishing project in the Datong Coalfield officially commenced in mid-June.

    This year's fire extinguishing project focuses on the Majiliang and Hujiawan fire zones, which have been burning for the longest time and causing the greatest damage. There are many old kiln openings around these two fire zones, allowing air to enter and exit frequently. Coupled with mountain fissures and ground subsidence, they have formed underground large stoves with natural chimneys and fire outlets, causing the coal seams to burn continuously and grow larger.

    This year's fire extinguishing method is mainly to seal these kiln openings, subsidence pits, and fissures to isolate the fire from the outside air. Currently, these sealing projects have commenced one after another and are planned to be completed by the end of October. A firebreak wall will also be built between the Huangtugou Mine in the Majiliang area and the fire zone to protect the mine that is currently in production. The construction of this firebreak wall will begin at the end of June. In the Hujiawan fire zone, the method of irrigating with mountain floods will also be tested. Currently, the flood barrier dam project has commenced, striving to be completed before the end of July, so that the floods in August and September can be used to extinguish the fire.

Let Tianjin and the Jinpu Railway No Longer Be Threatened by Floods

    The spring project of the Duliu Diversion River in Hebei has been largely completed successfully. The entire Duliu Diversion River's earthwork project of more than 13 million cubic meters, after less than two months of intense construction by more than 80,000 laborers and workers, had completed more than 11.07 million cubic meters by May 27 (including the 4 million cubic meters completed in the autumn of last year), accounting for more than 85 percent of the entire earthwork project.

    The scale of the Duliu Diversion River project is very large, starting from the confluence of the Daqing River and the Ziya River upstream, meandering along the banks for more than 70 kilometers, and reaching the coast of the Bohai Sea. When it passes through the Machang Diversion River and enters Dagang, the width between the left and right dikes is more than 30 kilometers. Since more than 80,000 laborers entered the battle on April 5, new changes have been taking place every day on the majestic two large dikes. The 26,000 laborers from the Tianjin Special Zone first completed the task of dike construction ten days ahead of schedule. Then, the laborers from Huanghua and Jiaohe counties in the Cangxian Special Zone completed their tasks thirteen to twenty-four days ahead of schedule. The control mechanism on the Duliu Diversion River—the diversion gate—was completed in mid-June, except for the partial installation of gate components. Before the Party's birthday on "July 1st," the large gate will open wide, swallowing and storing the floodwaters of the Daqing River, and the Duliu Diversion River will shoulder the task of discharging more than 4 billion cubic meters of floodwaters. From then on, the water disasters in the Daqing River basin will be greatly reduced, and the threat of floods to Tianjin and the Jinpu Railway for many years will be lifted. (Hu Yuquan, Zhang Peng)

Use Flood Control Dikes to Block Floods from the Upper Reaches of the Minjiang River

    The Minjiang River is the largest river in Fujian Province, with its basin spanning more than twenty counties. The upstream tributaries are all located in the mountainous northern Fujian region. During the rainy season from April to July each year, mountain torrents erupt in the upper reaches, and the rapid currents rush down, often causing flooding on both banks of the downstream. If it encounters high tides, the disaster will be even more severe. After liberation, for three consecutive years of floods, the Communist Party and the People's Government, while leading the people to fight floods and provide disaster relief, began surveying and designing to find ways to eliminate the threat of floods on both banks of the lower reaches of the Minjiang River. After repeated research and soliciting the opinions of the masses, it was decided to build flood control dikes in the lower reaches of the Minjiang River. From August to December of last year, construction began on a 3,625-meter-long earth dike and a 2,101-meter-long stone dike on the section from Wanshou Bridge to Hongshan Bridge in Fuzhou. After gaining initial experience, on January 3 of this year, a large-scale dike construction project with a total length of 133 li was started on both banks of the North and South Harbors and around Nantai Island.

    This project, after nearly one hundred days of hard work by more than 60,000 laborers, more than 1,000 cadres, and engineering personnel, has been fully completed. In the future, under the condition that the flood does not exceed the highest historical water level, the city of Fuzhou, where 500,000 people live, as well as the suburbs of Fuzhou and the vast rural areas of Minhou, which have 160,000 mu of fertile land, will begin to get rid of the "major floods and major disasters, minor floods and minor disasters" situation that has plagued them for hundreds of years.

The Boshui Reservoir Water Conveyance Tunnel Has Been Opened

    The Boshui Reservoir is one of the valley reservoirs in the Huai River harnessing project, with the outlet facing Boshui Mountain and Ligang Mountain. A large dam must be built in between. At the same time, a water conveyance tunnel of more than 300 meters long must be dug through the waist of Ligang Mountain as the reservoir gate to control the floodwaters in the reservoir. This task was undertaken by a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army. At the end of October last year, the mountain skin was cleared, and the entrance began to enter the tunnel in January this year, and the exit began to enter the tunnel in February. All technicians and military workers exerted infinite wisdom and worked day and night with selfless labor enthusiasm. The entrance and exit advanced at an average rate of 1.7 or 8 meters per day. On June 1, the entrance and exit successfully met. In this project, a total of more than 3,900 cubic meters of stone and more than 18,000 cubic meters of earth were excavated. The successful completion of this project gave the entire builders of the reservoir great excitement and encouragement. (Wang Wenlian, Yu Si, Bingren)

    阜新平安竖井井筒工程提前七十天完工
    阜新矿务局机械化新型竖井——平安竖井的井筒建设工程，已比国家计划提前七十天在六月二十二日完工。这个在英、美资本主义国家需要三年四年才能完成的工程，现在不到一年的时间就完成了，而且达到了好、快、省和安全的要求。目前，整个竖井就要开始井下平巷的建设。
    平安竖井的建设得到苏联专家的重大帮助。从去年七月竖井井筒工程开工以来，苏联专家曾先后提出许多有关加速工程进度和提高质量的建议。职工们在执行专家建议时并根据本身的条件加以创造性的发挥。如井筒掘进中的一个重要问题是打壁座，苏联专家在这方面介绍了用插鞘式吊盘打基脚的方法，因为现场条件不足，职工们就根据苏联专家建议的精神研究出高空打壁座的办法，克服了困难，增加了实际作业时间。在凿岩方面，谷发明先进小组根据苏联专家提出的用长钎子打眼的办法，改进了钎子，加大了钎子头，并研究了打深眼的技术，因而创造了每天掘进三点五公尺的最高纪录。苏联专家提出的双桶提升的建议，大大加速了提取岩石的速度。三月份，建井工人创造了月进七十四点二八公尺的新纪录。今年四月间，井筒掘进中碰到了砾岩层和夹水层，由于执行了苏联专家提出的新的措施，克服了这个阻难，到五月份，又创造了月进八十点五六公尺的全国新纪录。（据新华社讯）
    天成铁路铺轨到广汉
    天成铁路已在六月二十一日铺轨到离成都三十八公里多的广汉县城。为了纪念开工一周年，成都到广汉之间的人民将于“七一”隆重举行成广段通车仪式。
    天成铁路铺轨架桥工作是在今年四月二十七日由成都开始的。五十多天来，工人们夜以继日地与洪水作斗争，迅速架起了二十三座桥梁，使铁轨及时铺到广汉车站。铺轨工作中，由于工人们认真执行了“枕木不方不打，道钉不直不打，轨距不对不打，垫板不正不打”的四不打公约，铺轨工程质量大大提高。（新华社）
    扑灭大同煤田的地下火
    大同煤田消火工程已在六月中旬正式开工。
    今年消火工程的重点放在燃烧时间最长为害最大的马脊梁、胡家湾两个火区。这两个火区四周旧窑口很多，空气时常出入，加上山间的裂缝和地面的陷坑，就形成了有天然的烟囱和火口的地下大炉灶，因而煤层燃烧长期不熄，愈来愈大。
    今年消火办法主要是把这些窑口、陷坑、裂缝密闭起来，使火和外面空气隔绝。目前，这些密闭工程已先后动工，计划在十月底以前全部完工。在马脊梁区的黄土沟矿和火区之间还准备修建一道包围火区的防火墙，以保护正在生产的矿井。这个防火墙工程将在六月底开工。在胡家湾火区，还将试用山洪浇灌办法。目前，拦洪坝工程已经动工，争取在七月底以前完成，以便使用八、九月份的洪水来浇灭火灾。（据新华社讯）
    让天津市和津浦路不再受洪水的威胁
    河北独流减河春工工程，大部胜利完工。整个独流减河一千三百多万土方工程，经过八万多民工和工人不到两个月的紧张施工，到五月二十七日止，已经完成一千一百零七万多公方（包括去年秋工完成的四百万公方），占整个土方工程的百分之八十五以上。
    独流减河工程的规模很大，上由大清河、子牙河的汇流处起，两岸蜿蜒七十多公里，到达渤海海岸止。当它穿过马厂减河，进入大港后，左右两堤宽达三十多公里。自从四月五日八万多民工进入战斗以来，雄伟的两条大堤，每天都发生着新的变化。天津专区的两万六千民工，首先提前十天完成了筑堤任务。接着沧县专区的黄骅、交河两县的民工，提前十三天到二十四天完成了任务。独流减河上的操纵机关——进洪闸，除部分的安装闸门工程外，整个建筑工程在六月中旬完成。在党的生日“七一”前，大闸将张开大口，吞蓄大清河的洪水，独流减河将肩负起宣泄四十多亿立方洪水的任务。从此，大清河流域的水患将大大减轻，多年来洪水对天津市和津浦铁路的威胁，将得到解除。  （胡玉泉、张鹏）
    用防洪大堤挡住闽江上游流下的洪水
    闽江是福建省最大的河流，流域遍及二十余县。上游支流都在山高岭峻的闽北地区，每年四月至七月雨季期间，上游山洪暴发，急流奔腾而下，下游两岸往往泛滥成灾。如遇大潮顶托，则灾情更为严重。解放后接连三年洪水，共产党与人民政府一面领导人民抗洪救灾，一面着手勘察、设计，寻求解除闽江下游两岸洪水威胁的途径。经过反复研究和征求群众意见后，决定修建闽江下游防洪堤。去年八月到十二月，开始在福州万寿桥到洪山桥一段修筑长三千六百二十五公尺的土堤、二千一百零一公尺的石堤。在取得初步经验后，于今年一月三日开始了南北港两岸、南台岛周围全长达一百三十三华里的大规模建堤工程。
    这个工程，经过六万多名民工、一千多名干部和工程人员近一百天的努力，已经全部完工了。今后在洪水不超过历史最高水位的情况下，五十万人口聚居的福州市以及拥有十六万亩良田沃地的福州市郊和闽侯广大农村，将开始摆脱数百年来年年不断的“大水大灾、小水小灾”的局面。
    薄山水库输水道打通了
    薄山水库是治淮工程中的山谷水库之一，出口处对着薄山和李岗山，在这中间要修起一道大坝。同时要在李岗山腰打通一道长达三百余公尺的输水隧洞，做为水库大门，以操纵库内的洪水。这一任务是由人民解放军某部担任的。去年十月底开始清理山皮，今年一月出口处开始进洞，二月进口处开始进洞。全体技工、军工发挥了无穷的智慧，以忘我的劳动热情夜以继日地工作着。进出口每日平均以一点七、八公尺的速度前进着，六月一日进、出口已胜利会师。在这个工程中，共开挖石方三千九百余方，土方一万八千余方。这一工程的胜利完成，给水库全体修建者以莫大兴奋和鼓舞。  （汪文廉、于思、冰人）
