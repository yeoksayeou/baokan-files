Comrades Representatives,

	On behalf of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, I extend warm congratulations to the Second National Congress of the All-China Youth Federation!

	This congress widely includes youth representatives from all regions, the military, and various party groups across the country. After this congress, the youth of the whole country will unite more closely under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao. In the three years since the national liberation, our great motherland has completed a series of social reforms and economic recovery work. The youth of the whole country have actively participated in these tasks, achieved considerable success, and produced a large number of heroes and models on various work fronts. This is to be congratulated.

	Comrades, representatives of all youth! In the great struggle to resist US aggression and aid Korea, the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army have fought side by side for nearly three years and achieved a great victory. In our victorious struggle and resolute will to strive for peace, the truce negotiations at Panmunjom, after many twists and turns and struggles, finally reached an agreement on the issue of repatriation of prisoners of war, clearing the obstacles to a Korean armistice and opening the way for a peaceful settlement of the Korean issue. This is a victory for all the people of China and the people of Korea, and a victory for all peace-loving people in the world. We should be happy for this victory of peace, which was achieved after nearly three years of hard struggle.

	Comrades, representatives of youth! We have entered the planned construction year this year and are preparing to convene people's congresses at all local levels, and on this basis, we will convene the National People's Congress. The Second National Congress of the All-China Youth Federation is being held at this time, which is of great significance. This congress will surely call on and unite the youth of the whole country to enthusiastically participate in all aspects of economic construction work, increase production, practice strict economy, and strive to complete and over fulfill the 1953 economic construction plan! At the same time, this congress will surely call on and unite the youth of the whole country to actively participate in the election of representatives to the people's congresses at all levels, elect those whom they consider satisfactory and necessary to participate in the management of state power, further promote people's democracy, and enhance the strength of national construction!

	Comrades, youth of the whole country! In order to undertake these major tasks, you must work hard to study political theory and advanced scientific knowledge, especially to learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, pay attention to physical exercise to strengthen your physique, so as to exert your greater strength.

	We firmly believe that your congress will give full play to the enthusiasm and initiative of the youth, and more bravely participate in the national construction work to build our beautiful country. Let us all work together!

	I wish the Second National Congress of the All-China Youth Federation a complete success!
