Editor's Note: After the People's Daily published a report on May 11th on page three, "The County Magistrate of Huang County, Shandong Province, Regularly Receives People's Visits, Strengthening the Ties Between the Government and the People, and Effectively Educating Cadres and the Masses," we received letters from Song Lianjie and Zhao Linfu of the CCP Wu'yi County Committee Office in Hebei Province, and Shao Xunshu of the General Office Secretariat of the North China Administrative Committee. Song and Zhao wrote: "We feel that what the county magistrate of Huang County is doing is very correct and very necessary. However, if the county can solve problems in this way, what methods are they using?" Shao Xunshu wrote: "It is very good and necessary for responsible cadres at all levels to pay attention to the work of people's letters and visits, and to take the time to personally meet with the masses. But is it necessary to adopt the method of regularly receiving people's visits? I believe that leaders at all levels must take the time to handle major issues in the people's letters and visits and personally meet with some people who need to be met, but should not regularly and universally receive them. What the county magistrate of Huang County is doing will create passivity, and this working method should not be adopted."

We forwarded these letters to Jiang Songshan, the county magistrate of Huang County, for research and answers. We recently received his reply, which is excerpted below.

Is the County Magistrate's Regular Reception of People's Visits a Workable System?

I. The system of Huang County People's Government, whereby the county magistrate personally receives visits from the people on the first and fifteenth days of the lunar month, has been in effect from March 15th to May 27th for six times: the first time, 42 people (note: the May 11th People's Daily incorrectly reported 482 people); the second time, 56 people (previously incorrectly reported as 57 people); the third time, 116 people; the fourth time, 82 people (the masses were busy watering wheat, and fewer people visited); the fifth time, 114 people; and the sixth time, 180 people. A total of 590 people were received in six times, and the number of cases accepted was the same as the number of people. Among them, excluding 119 cases that were pending, 175 cases have now been processed, and another 296 cases are planned to be processed through the township people's representatives' conferences before the wheat harvest.

II. How do we receive visiting people? Taking the March 15th visit as an example: "We received a total of 42 people, 29 of whom were received by the county magistrate and deputy county magistrate, and the other 13 were received by nine section and bureau chiefs. When receiving them, we tried our best to be considerate of the difficulties of the masses, recognizing that their visits were not easy, and we listened patiently and humbly to the problems reflected by the masses. If the masses revealed ideological concerns during the conversation, we immediately explained the policies to allow the masses to fully express their demands or opinions. Then we explained in a self-critical and sincere manner how we would handle the problems reflected by the masses, in principle, to the satisfaction of the visitors. One old man reflected: "The people's government led by Chairman Mao is truly different from the past." Another old man said: "In the old society, not to mention not daring to see the county magistrate, one didn't even dare to see the door of the county magistrate." This shows that the masses are very welcome to what we are doing.

III. Is it appropriate to do this? This is done in accordance with the resolutions of the Huang County People's Representative Conference. Based on the actual situation, we believe that doing so is appropriate. Doing so can educate and improve cadres with real people and real things and overcome bureaucratism. When more serious problems are exposed, it can give cadres a deeper lesson. Judging from the problems that have already been reflected, there are ten cases of homicide and forty-two cases of violations of law and discipline. This is our gain, and it also makes us vigilant that the problems in Huang County are not insignificant. We believe that if we do not implement regular receptions and adopt the method of irregular fragmented receptions, it will take more time and the results will be smaller.

IV. More and more people are asking to see the county magistrate. Can everyone meet with the county magistrate? Looking at the situation of the sixth visit, which had the most visitors, a total of 180 people visited, and all of them met with the county magistrate. Our specific approach is this: Usually, we assign seven section and bureau chiefs and five staff members to go to the countryside to handle problems in conjunction with the central work; every lunar first and fifteenth, these comrades return to the county the day before, on the one hand to report on their work situation for the past thirteen days, and on the other hand to prepare to help the county magistrate receive visiting people the next day. Before the masses arrive, we are already waiting at the door. After the masses arrive, they are first led to the county magistrate's office. The county magistrate personally meets with the visitors, offers condolences, and explains that the county magistrate cannot receive everyone, and detailed conversations can only be conducted separately. The masses understand this difficulty, so they all happily go to the responsible comrades designated by the county magistrate to explain the problems they want to talk about in detail.

V. Our reception of visiting people has not only changed the work style of county-level cadres but has also promoted the transformation of the work style of district and township cadres. We have jointly solved a problem: in the past, we only saw that the central work arranged by the higher authorities was a big thing that should be done well, and we thought that the things raised by the masses were trivial "small things" that could be managed or not; now we have corrected this incorrect idea. In the past, we often heard the masses say: "During the War of Resistance Against Japan, you helped solve everything in our homes, but after you entered the city, you forgot the old people, forgot your roots!" Since the implementation of the system of the county magistrate regularly receiving people's visits, such reflections have not been heard. The policies of the Party and the People's Government directly met with the masses, expanded the political influence of the Party and the People's Government among the people, and made the masses truly realize from practice that only under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party can the working people be masters of their own affairs, and they have more confidence in supervising the work of their government staff to do a good job for the masses. Recently, we have received letters from comrades of the Chinese People's Volunteers saying that Huang County's reception of people's visits has further encouraged their fighting spirit.

    县长定期接待人民来访的制度行得通吗
    编者按：五月十一日本报第三版发表“山东省黄县县长定期接待人民来访，加强了政府和人民的联系，有效地教育了干部和群众”的报道后，先后接到中共河北省武邑县委办公室宋联捷、赵霖甫和华北行政委员会办公厅秘书处邵循恕的来信。宋、赵来信说：“我们觉得黄县县长这样做是非常正确与十分必要的。但是，如果该县这样能够解决问题的话，请问他们用的什么方式方法？”邵循恕来信说：“各级负责干部重视人民来信来访工作，并抽出一定的时间亲自接见群众，这是很好的，也是必要的。但是否需要采取定期接见人民来访的方式？我认为，各级首长必须抽出一定的时间来处理人民来信来访中的重大问题和亲自接见一些必需接见的群众，而不应定期普遍地接见。黄县县长这样做，会造成被动，这种工作方法是不宜采用的。”
    本报将这些信件转请黄县县长姜松山研究解答。最近接到他的回信，现摘要发表在下面。
    县长定期接待人民来访的制度行得通吗
    一、黄县人民政府每逢农历初一和十五日由县长亲自接待人民群众来访的制度，自三月十五日开始实行到五月二十七日，已经六次：第一次四十二人
    （按：五月十一日本报错报道为四百八十二人）；第二次五十六人（前错报道为五十七人）；第三次一百十六人；第四次八十二人（群众正忙于浇小麦，来访者减少）；第五次一百十四人；第六次一百八十人。六次共接见群众五百九十人，受理案件数与人数相同。其中除属于催办案件的一百十九起外，现在已处理完毕的有一百七十五起，另二百九十六起打算在麦收前通过乡各界人民代表大会进行处理。
    二、我们是怎样接待来访人民的？以三月十五日那次说：“我们一共接见了群众四十二人，其中二十九人由正、副县长接见，另外十三人由九个科、局长接见。接见时，我们尽量体贴群众的疾苦，群众的来之不易，并耐心地、虚心地倾听群众反映问题。如果群众在谈话中透露出思想上有顾虑，我们立即说明政策，让群众把要求或意见全部谈出来。然后我们带有检讨性地、诚恳地说明将如何处理群众反映的问题，原则上以达到来访人满意为止。一位老人反映：“毛主席领导的人民政府和过去比，真是两样滋味。”另一位老人则说：“在旧社会，不用说不敢见县长，连县长的门也不敢见。”这可以说明，群众是非常欢迎我们这样做的。
    三、这样做是否适宜呢？这是按照县各界人民代表会议决议做的。以实践的情况看，我们认为这样做是适宜的。这样做能以活人活事教育和提高干部，克服官僚主义。有较严重的问题被揭露后，更能使干部深刻地受到教训。就已经反映出来的问题看，属于人命案的十起，违法乱纪的四十二起，这就是我们的收获，也使我们警惕到：黄县存在的问题不是不严重。我们以为：如果不实行定期接见，而采取不定期的零碎接见的办法，就会费时间更多而收效反而小。
    四、要求见县长的群众越来越多，都能和县长见面吗？从来访群众最多的第六次的情形看，共有一百八十人来访，都和县长见了面。我们的具体作法是这样：平常共抽出七个科、局长和五个科员分别下乡结合中心工作处理问题；每逢农历初一、十五，这些同志便在头一天回到县里，一方面汇报他们十三天的工作情况，另一方面准备第二天帮助县长接待来访群众。群众没有来以前，我们已经在门口等待着。群众来了以后，首先被引到县长办公室。县长亲自和来访人见了面，慰问一番，说明县长一个人接待不了大家，详细谈话只能分别进行。群众谅解这种困难，所以都愉快地向县长指定的负责同志去详细谈出所要谈的问题。
    五、我们这样接待来访的人民，不仅转变了县一级干部的作风，同时也推动了区、乡干部作风的转变。我们共同解决了一个问题：过去我们只看到上面布置的中心工作是大事情，应该作好，而认为群众提出的事情是一些鸡毛蒜皮的“小事情”，可管可不管；现在我们纠正了这种不正确的想法。过去我们经常听到群众反映：“抗日战争时期，你们在俺家里什么事都帮助解决，可是你们进了城就忘了老百姓，忘了本了！”自县长定期接待来访人民的制度实行后，这样的反映听不到了。党和人民政府的政策直接和群众见了面，扩大了党和人民政府在人民群众中的政治影响，使群众从实践中真正体会到只有在毛主席、共产党领导下，劳动人民才能当家作主人，更有信心监督自己政府的工作人员为群众作好工作。最近，我们曾经接到中国人民志愿军同志们的来信说：黄县这样接待人民来访，更鼓舞了他们的斗争情绪。
