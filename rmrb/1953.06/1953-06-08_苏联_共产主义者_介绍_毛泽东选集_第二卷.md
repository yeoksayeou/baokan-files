Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 7th. The eighth issue of the Soviet journal "Communist" for 1953 recently published an article by V. Mikhailov introducing the Russian edition of Volume Two of "Selected Works of Mao Tse-tung," published in April by the Moscow Foreign Languages Publishing House. The article first points out that the works in Volume Two of "Selected Works of Mao Tse-tung" summarize the revolutionary struggle experience of the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people in the early period of the War of Resistance Against Japan and clarify the historical significance of the Chinese people's struggle. The article then describes the historical background and basic content of Volume Two of "Selected Works of Mao Tse-tung," and focuses on introducing "On Protracted War" and "On Contradiction." The article states: "'On Contradiction' helped the Chinese Communist Party to smash dogmatism and empiricism. Comrade Mao Tse-tung used many examples to illustrate the serious harm of dogmatism in theory to revolutionary practice. This work itself is an example of the unity of theory and practice, a theoretical, Marxist summary of the Chinese people's years of revolutionary struggle for liberation, and an example of creatively studying the interaction of practice and theory." The article concludes: The works published in Volume Two of "Selected Works of Mao Tse-tung" are the result of creatively applying Marxism-Leninism under specific Chinese conditions, a testament to the great organizational work of the Chinese Communist Party during the difficult days of enemy aggression, and evidence of the Chinese Communist Party's strength, loyalty to the cause of its people's liberation, ardent patriotism, and confidence in victory.

    苏联“共产主义者”介绍“毛泽东选集”第二卷
    【新华社莫斯科七日电】新近出版的“共产主义者”一九五三年第八期刊载维·米海耶夫的论文，介绍莫斯科外国书籍出版局四月间出版的“毛泽东选集”第二卷俄文版。论文首先指出：“毛泽东选集”第二卷中的著作总结了中国共产党和中国人民在抗日战争初期的革命斗争经验，阐明了中国人民斗争的历史意义。论文接着叙述了“毛泽东选集”第二卷的时代背景和基本内容，并且着重地介绍了“论持久战”和“矛盾论”。论文说：“矛盾论”帮助了中国共产党粉碎教条主义和经验主义。毛泽东同志用许多例子说明理论中的教条主义对于革命实践的严重危害。这篇著作本身就是理论和实践一致的范例，是对于中国人民争取解放的多年革命斗争的理论的、马克思主义的总结，是创造性地研究实践和理论的相互作用的范例。论文最后说：在“毛泽东选集”第二卷中发表的著作，是在中国具体条件下创造性地运用马克思列宁主义的成果，是中国共产党在敌人侵略的困难日子里进行巨大组织工作的明证，是中国共产党坚强并且忠于自己人民解放事业、怀着热烈爱国主义精神、充满胜利信心的证据。
