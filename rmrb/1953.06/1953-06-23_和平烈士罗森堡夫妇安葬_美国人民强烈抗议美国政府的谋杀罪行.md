Xinhua News Agency, New York, June 22nd: Under the auspices of the National Committee to Secure Justice in the Rosenberg Case in the United States, the funeral of the American peaceful martyrs, the Rosenbergs, was held at a funeral home in Brooklyn, New York, on the afternoon of the 21st. Twenty thousand people braved the heat to pay their respects, and the funeral turned into a magnificent demonstration.

After the bodies of the Rosenbergs, who died heroically at New New Prison in New York on the 19th, were moved to the Brooklyn funeral home, there was a constant stream of people coming to pay their respects. Despite the scorching sun, people from all over still lined up in long queues outside the funeral home, waiting to catch a glimpse of the martyrs' remains. People walked past the Rosenbergs' remains in rows of two or three. More and more people came to pay their respects, and shortly before the start of the funeral, an average of two thousand people per hour passed by the Rosenbergs' remains.

Around the funeral home, the reactionary American authorities deployed hundreds of foot and mounted police and plainclothes agents as if facing a formidable enemy.

At 2:17 p.m. local time, the solemn funeral attended by tens of thousands of people began. Mr. Blanning, chairman of the National Committee to Secure Justice in the Rosenberg Case, delivered a eulogy first. He said: We believe that the Rosenbergs sacrificed for all of us, and we must continue to fight for the cause they championed. The Rosenbergs still had faith in the kind of America we hoped for until the end.

Lawyer Bloch, who had been defending the Rosenbergs since their arrest, said: The United States is already under the iron heel of military dictatorship. He said the killing of the Rosenbergs was "a brutal and premeditated murder." He said: "President Eisenhower, Attorney General Brownell, and Hoover (the head of the FBI, the American secret service) should be blamed for the murder of the Rosenbergs." He called on everyone to strengthen the struggle to resist the Nazi forces that killed the Rosenbergs. He said: "In my many years as a lawyer, I have never felt as honored as I do to speak for such two rare people, and I feel like a person who has lost a brother."

Rosenberg's old mother fainted twice near their couple's remains.

Subsequently, the Rosenbergs' coffins were moved to a hearse, followed by a long funeral procession, slowly heading to the Wilwood Cemetery in Paine Lawn, Long Island.

At the cemetery, a burial ceremony was held. Mrs. David Ellman, Executive Secretary of the National Committee to Secure Justice in the Rosenberg Case, Mrs. Glendon Partridge, Chairman of the Canadian National Committee to Save the Rosenbergs, Mrs. Sobell, and others spoke. Mrs. Sobell said: "Although we are going to bury their bodies, their lives must be immortal. We must remember that terror will never be useful. We are fearless." Partridge said that the couple "never had the opportunity to vindicate themselves before the highest court." He said that millions of Canadians knew that the Rosenbergs were murdered and felt deeply disappointed and saddened.

After the ceremony, two thousand people stood solemnly around the grave, watching the Rosenbergs' remains being laid to rest.

    和平烈士罗森堡夫妇安葬
    美国人民强烈抗议美国政府的谋杀罪行
    【新华社二十二日讯】纽约消息：在美国争取罗森堡案件公正裁决全国委员会的主持下，美国和平烈士罗森堡夫妇的殡礼于二十一日下午在纽约布鲁克林殡仪馆举行，两万人冒着炎热前往吊唁，殡礼形成了雄壮的示威。
    十九日在纽约新新监狱昂然就义的罗森堡夫妇的遗体移放到布鲁克林殡仪馆后，即有络绎不绝的人流前去吊唁。尽管烈日当空，从各处赶来的人仍在殡仪馆外排成长长的队伍，等待进去一睹烈士的遗容。人们两三个一排地走过罗森堡夫妇的灵旁。吊唁的人愈来愈多，在殡礼开始前不久，每小时平均有两千人走过罗森堡夫妇灵旁。
    在殡仪馆的周围，美国反动当局如临大敌地派了数百名步、骑警察和便衣特务巡逻把守。
    当地时间下午二时十七分，上万人参加的庄严的殡礼开始了。争取罗森堡案件公正裁决全国委员会主席布兰宁首先致悼词。他说：我们认为罗森堡夫妇是为我们大家牺牲的，我们必须继续为他们两人所拥护的事业而斗争。罗森堡夫妇到最后还对我们所希望的那样一个美国抱有信心。
    从罗森堡夫妇被捕起就一直为他们辩护的布洛克律师说：美国已处在军事独裁的铁蹄下。他说杀害罗森堡夫妇的事件是“残暴的蓄意谋杀”。他说：“谋杀罗森堡夫妇应归咎于艾森豪威尔总统、司法部长布朗纳尔和胡佛（美国特务机关联邦调查局的头子）。”他号召大家加强斗争，抵抗杀害了罗森堡夫妇的纳粹主义势力。他说：“在我多年执行律师职务中，从来没有感觉到过像代表这样两个难得的人说话这样光荣，我感觉像一个失去了兄弟的人。”
    罗森堡的老母亲两次晕倒在他们夫妇两个的灵旁。
    随后，罗森堡夫妇的灵榇即移上灵车，后面随着长长的送葬行列，慢慢地走向长岛培茵劳恩的威尔伍德墓地。
    在墓地，又举行了安葬仪式。争取罗森堡案件公正裁决全国委员会执行秘书戴维·埃尔曼的夫人、加拿大拯救罗森堡夫妇全国委员会主席格伦敦·帕特里奇、苏贝尔夫人等都讲了话。苏贝尔夫人说：“虽然我们要把他们的遗体埋葬，但是他们的生命一定永垂不朽。我们一定要记住，恐怖决不会有什么用处。我们毫无畏惧。”帕特里奇说：这一对夫妇“从来没有得到机会在最高级的法院面前来进行剖白”。他说，千百万加拿大人知道罗森堡夫妇被害，都深感失望和悲痛。
    仪式过后，两千人庄严肃穆地站在墓穴周围目送罗森堡夫妇的遗体入土。
