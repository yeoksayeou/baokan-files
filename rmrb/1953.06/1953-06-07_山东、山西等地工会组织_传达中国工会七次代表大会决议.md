    Trade Union Organizations in Shandong, Shanxi, and Other Places Convey Resolutions of the Seventh National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions
    Since mid-May, trade union organizations in Shandong, Shanxi, Hunan, Sichuan, Guangxi, and the cities of Wuhan, Benxi, and Fushun have successively launched work to convey the various resolutions of the Seventh National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions.
    The conveyance work of trade union organizations in various places is being carried out under the leadership of the local Communist Party of China (CPC). The CPC Shanxi Provincial Committee made a decision at the end of May regarding conveying and implementing the various resolutions of the Seventh National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions. The decision requires CPC committees at all levels throughout the province to organize delegates who attended the congress, before June 20th, to conduct reports to local Party, government, mass organizations cadres, especially trade union cadres and workers, so that every cadre and worker understands the significant meaning of the congress. The decision also requires local and municipal committees of the CPC to organize relevant cadres from the beginning of June to the end of July to seriously study the reports and documents of the congress, inspect trade union work, and resolve current problems in the work. The Sichuan Provincial Federation of Trade Unions' conveyance plan was approved by the CPC Sichuan Provincial Committee. The Provincial Federation of Trade Unions decided to convene a meeting of the executive committee of the Provincial Federation of Trade Unions to convey the resolutions after the conveyance in Chengdu City on June 5th, and then convey them to various places by industry. On May 27th, the delegates from the province who attended the Seventh National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions made a report to cadres of the second and third levels of the theoretical study class of the provincial-level Party and government organs. The Cultural and Education Department of the Provincial Federation of Trade Unions is preparing to compile the congress documents into teaching materials for universal education among workers throughout the province. Since the Wuhan Municipal Federation of Trade Unions began conveying the various resolutions of the congress on June 1st, more than 7,000 trade union cadres and workers have listened to the reports as of June 4th. The Municipal Federation of Trade Unions also decided to organize trade union cadres throughout the city to study the documents of the congress for a month, so that every cadre can understand and master the guidelines for trade union work.
    In the conveyance work, trade union organizations in various places have paid attention to linking with the actual work conditions of the local areas in order to improve work. For example, Yang Chao, Deputy Director of the Southwest Office of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, and Wang Su, Vice Chairman of the Benxi Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, emphasized in their reports that it is necessary to combine the current work of the region and unit, and implement the spirit of the congress into the actual work of every worker, technician, and staff member to ensure the completion and over-fulfillment of the national production plan. While carrying out the conveyance work, Changsha City, Hunan Province, also organized trade union cadres throughout the city to study the congress documents, and combined it with the study of methods to improve future work. For example, after listening to the reports, the trade union cadres of the state-owned Yuxiang Yarn Factory adjusted the organizational structure according to the guidelines and tasks stipulated by the congress in order to strengthen the leadership of trade union work. After listening to the reports from the delegates, the workers of various factories in Fushun City unanimously expressed that they would implement the resolutions of the congress with practical actions. Dai Shujin, a labor model from the Petroleum Plant No. 1, proposed: "Guarantee the implementation of the suggestions of Soviet experts, do a good job in the reform of the petroleum system, produce more gasoline for the country, and improve the quality of gasoline." The workers of Zhang Yugui's team of the Third Engineering Company of the Northeast Nonferrous Metals Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Heavy Industry of the Central People's Government proposed: The whole team should improve operations, the quality of work should reach 100%, complete the second quarter's task ten days ahead of schedule, and establish a good responsibility system.

    山东、山西等地工会组织
    传达中国工会七次代表大会决议
    【新华社六日讯】山东、山西、湖南、四川、广西等省和武汉、本溪、抚顺等市的工会组织，五月中旬以来相继展开关于中国工会第七次全国代表大会各项决议的传达工作。
    各地工会组织的传达工作，都是在当地中国共产党的领导下进行的。中国共产党山西省委员会在五月底就作出关于传达和贯彻中国工会第七次全国代表大会各项决议的决定。决定要求全省各级中共党委在六月二十日前，组织参加大会的代表，向当地党、政、工团的干部特别是工会干部和职工群众进行传达报告，使每个干部和职工都了解大会的重大意义。决定还要求中国共产党各地方委员会和市委，从六月初到七月底，专门组织有关干部认真学习大会的报告和文件，检查工会工作和解决当前工作中的问题。四川省总工会的传达计划，是由中国共产党四川省委员会批准的。省总工会决定六月五日在成都市传达完毕后，即召开省总工会执行委员会议进行传达，以后再按产业分别到各地传达。五月二十七日该省出席中国工会第七次全国代表大会的代表已向省一级党、政机关理论学习班的二、三两级干部进行了传达报告。省总工会文教部正准备把大会文件编成教材，在全省工人中普遍进行教育。武汉市总工会自六月一日开始传达大会的各项决议以来，到六月四日为止，听过传达报告的工会干部和职工已有七千多人。市总工会还决定以一个月的时间，组织全市工会干部学习大会的文件，以便使每个干部都能了解和掌握工会工作的方针。
    各地工会组织在传达工作中，都注意联系当地实际工作情况，以改进工作。如中华全国总工会西南办事处副主任杨超和本溪市总工会副主席王苏在传达报告中，都强调指出要结合本地区、本单位的当前工作，把大会精神贯彻到每个工人、技术人员和职员的实际工作中去，保证完成和超额完成国家生产计划。湖南省长沙市在进行传达工作的同时，还组织全市工会干部学习大会文件，结合研究改进今后工作的办法。如国营裕湘纱厂的工会干部听了传达报告后，即根据大会规定的方针和任务，调整组织机构，以加强工会工作的领导。抚顺市各厂职工听了代表们的传达报告后，都一致表示要以实际行动贯彻大会的决议。石油一厂劳动模范戴述金提出：“保证贯彻实行苏联专家建议，作好石油系统的改革工作，多给国家生产汽油，提高汽油质量。”中央人民政府重工业部东北有色金属管理局第三工程公司张玉贵小组的工人提出：全组改进操作，工作质量达到百分之百，提前十天完成第二季度任务，并建立好责任制。
