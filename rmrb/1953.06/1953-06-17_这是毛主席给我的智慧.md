This is the Wisdom Chairman Mao Gave Me
Representative to the Second National Youth Congress of China
Anshan City Model Worker Yu Baogang

I am a technician who has just graduated from school and participated in the industrial construction of the motherland for just over a year. When I was first assigned to work in the blooming mill of Anshan Iron and Steel Company, I was an amateur in rolling steel. Because I studied mechanics in school, I not only didn't understand steel rolling operations, but I also knew very little about the theory of steel rolling. Less than two months after arriving at the factory for an internship, the leadership assigned me to be the technician of a blooming mill, responsible for the blooming mill's production, operation, and preparation of spare parts for the rolling mill. As soon as I arrived at the workshop, I saw the complex rolling mill rolling large steel ingots weighing several tons into slender steel. I was really unsure in my heart. I watched and thought: I am an amateur in rolling steel, and now I am asked to take on such a heavy task, can I handle it? When I first accepted the task, I had no confidence. Once, not long after I started working in the shift, because the rolling groove wasn't adjusted properly, dozens of tons of steel were rolled into waste products, and I couldn't solve the problem. I looked at the wasted steel and shed tears of sadness.

The matter of producing waste products has been bothering me, even in the night I think about it. I thought, the rolling mill sometimes doesn't produce waste products. If I could master the theory of rolling steel and become familiar with the operation methods of the rolling mill, wouldn't I be able to avoid producing waste products? At this time, I felt a pressing need to learn from the advanced Soviet steel rolling experience and the practical operational experience of the workers.

In implementing the suggestions of Soviet experts, I gradually realized the advanced nature of Soviet science and technology. When the Soviet expert discovered that the steel we rolled had many cracks on the surface, he designed new grooves for us, asking us to remove the marks on the rolls. Initially, I was a bit skeptical about the Soviet expert's suggestion, but after the Soviet expert's patient explanation and my own practice, the correctness of the suggestion was confirmed. This helped me improve my technical level, and at the same time, made me further realize that to complete the construction tasks assigned by the country, I must learn from the Soviet Union.

At the same time, in my work, I deeply felt that the workers have rich production experience, which is often not found in books. As soon as they hear an abnormal sound from the rolling mill, they know where the problem is; as soon as they see the shape of the rolled steel, they can judge whether the groove of the rolling mill is normal. In order to learn production experience from the workers, I actively approached the workers, participated in their group meetings, and helped them take notes. When they were busy with work, I also worked with them. I taught them theoretical knowledge in mathematics, drafting, etc.; they also helped me master the operation methods and taught me the adjustment methods of the rolling mill. In this way, many workers became my good friends. Under the guidance of Soviet experts and the help of worker comrades, I initially mastered the operation and adjustment methods of this rolling mill in two months.

In the production increase and economy campaign, I and the workers jointly gathered the tips found by the workers and the advanced experience in steel rolling operation. After technical appraisal, several operations were carried out simultaneously in a rhythmic manner; and the experience of several advanced producers was summarized, which is the "Rapid Steel Rolling Operation Method." This method increased the rolling speed by more than 30 percent, while saving electricity and reducing waste products. Calculating only these three items, on average, each month we can increase production and save the country wealth equivalent to 53,000 tons of grain. Therefore, our rolling shift was selected as the Anshan City Model Labor Shift, and I was also named a Model Worker.

In the campaign to develop mechanical automation, with the support of the Party, I helped the workers to successfully develop the automatic descaling device for the rolling mill ditch, replacing the heavy physical labor of the workers with mechanized equipment. As long as the worker turns on the electrical switch, the iron scale automatically flows into the pre-placed iron scale box.

The achievements and glory I have obtained today should be attributed to the Party and our beloved Chairman Mao, because the Party and Chairman Mao have given me wisdom. I cannot be satisfied with the existing achievements. In the future, I must continue to improve my political and ideological level, strive to learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, continue to learn from the workers, and constantly improve my technical level. I will actively participate in production competitions, and together with the workers, complete and overfulfill the tasks assigned to us by the state, and respond to Chairman Mao's call with practical actions of rolling high-quality steel, and answer the people's ardent hopes for us.

In order to realize the industrialization of our country and gradually transition to socialism, I am determined to implement the spirit of the Second National Youth Congress of China, unite with the youth of the whole country, give full play to our youth's greater strength, and build our motherland!

    这是毛主席给我的智慧
    中华全国青年第二次代表大会代表
    鞍山市劳动模范  于保刚
    我是一个刚从学校毕业参加祖国工业建设不过一年多的技术员。当我刚被分配到鞍山钢铁公司初轧轧钢厂工作的时候，我对轧钢工作还是个外行。因为我在学校里学的是机械，我不仅不懂得轧钢操作，就是轧钢方面的理论也知道得很少。到厂见习还不到两个月，领导方面就分配我当一台初轧轧钢机的技术员，负责初轧机的生产、操作和给轧钢机准备备品等工作。我一到车间，就看到复杂的轧钢机把几吨重的大钢锭轧成了细长的钢材。我的心里真是摸不着底，我边看边想：我对轧钢工作是个外行，现在要我担负这样重的任务，能够担当得起来吗？刚开始接受任务的时候，我是没有信心的。有一次我刚到班上工作不久，由于轧辊孔型没有调整好，把几十吨的钢材轧成了废品，而我又没有办法解决这个问题，我便看着那轧废了的钢材，难过得流下了眼泪。
    出废品的事一直烦扰着我，甚至在夜里我也想着它。我想轧钢机有时也不出废品，如果我能够掌握轧钢的理论，熟悉了轧钢机的操作法，不就可以不出废品了吗？这时，我迫切感到需要学习苏联先进的轧钢经验和工人的实际操作经验。
    在贯彻苏联专家的建议中，我逐步认识到苏联科学技术的先进性。当苏联专家发现我们轧出的钢材表面有很多裂纹的时候，他便给我们设计了新的孔型，要我们去掉轧辊上的刻痕。最初我对苏联专家的建议还有些怀疑，但是经过苏联专家的耐心讲解和自己的实践，证实了建议的正确性。这帮助我提高了技术水平，同时使我进一步认识到要完成国家所交给的建设任务，必须向苏联学习。
    同时，在工作当中，我深深地感觉到工人们有丰富的生产经验，这些经验往往在书本上是找不到的。他们只要一听到轧钢机发出的不正常的声音，就知道那儿出了毛病；只要一看到轧出的钢材的形状，他们就能判断轧钢机的孔型是否正常。为了向工人们学习生产经验，我主动地接近工人，参加他们的小组会，帮助他们作记录。当他们工作忙的时候，我也动手和他们一块工作。我教给他们数学、制图等方面的理论知识；他们也帮助我掌握操作法，教给我轧钢机的调整方法。这样，很多工人便成了我要好的朋友。在苏联专家的指导和工人同志的帮助下，我就在两个月内初步掌握了这台轧钢机的操作和调整方法。
    在增产节约运动中，我和工人共同把工人们找出来的窍门和轧钢操作上的先进经验集中起来，经过技术鉴定，使几种操作交叉起来有节奏地同时进行；又把几个先进生产者的经验总结起来，这就是“快速轧钢操作法”。这种方法使轧钢速度提高了百分之三十以上，同时节省了电量，减少了废品。仅按这三项来计算，平均每个月可给国家增产节约五万三千吨粮食的财富。因此我们压延班被选为鞍山市的劳动模范班，我也被评为劳动模范。
    在开展机械自动化的运动中，我在党的支持下帮助工人把轧钢机地沟自动化除铁皮的装置研究成功了，用机械化的设备代替了工人们繁重的体力劳动。只要工人一开动电气开关，铁皮就自动地流到事先放好的铁皮箱子里去了。
    我今天所获得的这些成绩和光荣，应该归于党和我们亲爱的毛主席，因为党和毛主席使我有了智慧。我不能满足于已有的成绩，今后一定要继续提高自己的政治思想水平，努力学习苏联先进经验，继续向工人学习，不断提高自己的技术水平。我将积极参加生产竞赛，和工人们一道完成和超额完成国家交给我们的任务，并以轧好优质钢的实际行动来响应毛主席的号召，来回答人民对我们的热望。
    为着实现我国的工业化和逐步过渡到社会主义，我决心贯彻中华全国第二次青年代表大会的精神，和全国的青年团结在一起，发挥我们青年更大的力量，建设我们的祖国！
