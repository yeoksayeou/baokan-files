    Harbin Institute of Technology Students' Schedule is Unreasonable
    Assistant Teacher Xu Yaoming from Harbin Institute of Technology writes: Our school's students have an excessive study burden, with weekly study time generally exceeding fifty-four hours. Many students also do homework in classrooms on Sundays. Although the school implements a "six-hour consistent system," some classes' experiments and internships are still scheduled in the afternoon. For example, first-year students in the vocational Mechanical Engineering Department and the Electrical Engineering Department have classes for three afternoons each week – two practice sessions or drafting, and one political class. Some exams are also scheduled in the afternoon or evening. The arrangement of the schedule is also unreasonable. Classes start at eight o'clock in the morning for a total of six periods, and end at one fifteen in the afternoon. After eating, classes or self-study resume at two o'clock. Extracurricular activities and sports begin around three thirty or four o'clock. Dinner is at five twenty, and evening self-study begins again at six o'clock, lasting until nine twenty. This schedule arrangement almost eliminates students' rest time after meals. Under these circumstances, students rarely have time for current affairs study.
    In addition, the students' living conditions are very poor. The food at the subsidized large canteen (45 points per month, equivalent to about 90,000 yuan) often consists of red bean rice. The vegetables are mostly tofu and cabbage. Therefore, a large portion of the students add their own money to join the medium canteen meal group (60 points per month, equivalent to 120,000 yuan). Under these circumstances of heavy workload and poor nutrition, students' learning efficiency and health have been affected to some extent. The above problems should be quickly improved.

### 哈尔滨工业大学学生作息时间安排得不合理

    哈尔滨工业大学学生作息时间安排得不合理
    哈尔滨工业大学助教许耀铭来信：我校同学的学习负担过重，每周学习时间普遍超过五十四小时，很多同学星期天也在教室里作功课。学校虽然实行六时一贯制，但有些班级的试验和实习仍排在下午，如专修科机械系一年级和电机系一年级每周都有三个下午有课——二次实习或画图，一次政治课。有些考试也是排在下午或晚间。作息时间的安排也不够合理，早晨八时上课，共六节，下午一时一刻下课，吃饭后，接着二时正又上课或自习，三时半或四时左右开始文娱体育活动，五时二十分吃晚饭，六时正又开始晚自习，直到九时二十分止。这一作息时间的安排，几乎取消了同学饭后的休息时间。在这种情况下，同学们很少能进行时事学习。
    此外，同学饮食起居条件很差。按助学金标准办的大灶伙食（每月四十五分，约合九万元），经常吃红豆米饭，菜蔬多是豆腐和大白菜，因此有很大
    一部分同学自己加钱入中灶膳团（每月六十分，合十二万元）。在这种功课繁重、营养不良的情况下，同学们的学习效率和健康情况已受到一定影响。上述问题应该迅速改进。
