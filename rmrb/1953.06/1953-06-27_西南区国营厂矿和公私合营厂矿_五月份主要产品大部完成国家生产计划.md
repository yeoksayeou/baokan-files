State-owned factories and mines and joint state-private factories and mines in the Southwest Region performed well in fulfilling national production plans in May. Among the twenty-five major products such as steel ingots, steel, steel rails, iron ore, bituminous coal, metallurgical coke, electrolytic copper, and refined tin, twenty exceeded the production plans, and five products completed more than 90% of the plans. Of the forty-one factories and mines producing these twenty-five products, thirty units completed all plans, three units completed part of the major product plans, and eight units did not complete all plans.

The main reasons for the relatively good plan completion in May are:

	1. As a result of production reforms carried out over the past six months, most factories and mines have mobilized the masses more deeply. During the discussion of the May plan, they combined it with the fight against bureaucracy and solved some accumulated production problems, enabling workers to actively and consciously strive to complete the plan. For example, the First Workshop of Factory 101 identified the main problem in production before discussing the plan as poor quality. Then, a meeting of veteran workers, young workers, and technicians was convened for research. Employees proposed 117 technical and organizational measures to ensure the improvement of quality and the completion of the plan.

	2. The leadership of each factory has closely monitored the implementation of the plan. For example, cadres from the Party, administration, trade union, and Communist Youth League of Factory 612 frequently went to the workshops to understand the reasons why "the work is not well done," which promoted and improved production. Leaders of Factory 601 personally went to the workshops to check the unbalanced production in the first half of the month in a timely manner, which also enabled the plan to be completed smoothly.

	3. Most factories and mines have launched labor competitions to ensure the completion of production plans. After the Jinshansi Salt Factory in Wutongqiao initiated the competition, brine production exceeded the plan by 1.29% to 3.43%.

The main reasons why some factories and mines did not complete the plan in May are:

	1. Failure to conscientiously implement operating procedures resulted in many accidents. For example, Factory 506 had eight consecutive accidents in six days; the Yunnan Electric Power Bureau Power Plant had more than thirty accidents, large and small, in May, all of which affected the completion of the plan.

	2. Failure to focus on key issues and resolve them seriously. For example, the leaders of Coal Mine 405 had discovered that the tunneling work was lagging behind coal mining, but failed to organize forces to solve it seriously. As a result, the tunneling could not keep up with the coal mining, and the coal mining face collapsed, affecting the completion of the plan.

	3. Failure to fully mobilize the masses and rely on the masses to solve the problems existing in production. For example, the ash ring problem and the No. 2 cement mill problem in the Sichuan Cement Plant have not been solved for a long time, and new operating methods have not been formulated, and the workers have many opinions and low morale.

From the perspective of the May plan execution, the following problems still exist in various factories and mines in the Southwest Region:

	Conservative thinking still exists. In May, the planned output of thirteen of the twenty-five major products was less than the actual output in April. This should arouse vigilance.

	The phenomenon of loose production in the first half of the month and tight production in the second half of the month has not been overcome. In May, except for a few factories, mines, and workshops that have achieved balanced production, the phenomenon of loose production in the first half of the month and tight production in the second half of the month still exists in most factories and mines.

	The phenomenon of no one being responsible in factories and mines is serious. In some factories and mines in the Southwest Region, many tasks and systems, such as production scheduling, ordering, quota management, and original records, are not the responsibility of anyone.

	Finally, the weather is hot now, and the temperature on the factory floor is high. Various factories and mines, especially metallurgical and textile factories, should improve cooling, ventilation, safety and other equipment in a timely manner to ensure safe production and attendance rate.

### 西南区国营厂矿和公私合营厂矿  五月份主要产品大部完成国家生产计划

    西南区国营厂矿和公私合营厂矿
    五月份主要产品大部完成国家生产计划
    西南区主要国营厂矿和公私合营厂矿五月份完成国家生产计划情况较好。钢锭、钢材、钢轨、铁矿砂、烟煤、冶金焦、电铜、精锡等二十五种主要产品中，有二十种超额完成了生产计划，五种产品完成计划百分之九十以上。生产这二十五种产品的四十一个厂矿，全部完成计划的有三十个单位，部分主要产品完成计划的有三个单位，全部没有完成计划的有八个单位。
    五月份计划完成情况较好的原因，主要是：
    一、大多数厂矿由于半年多以来进行生产改革的结果，较深入地发动了群众，在讨论五月份计划时，结合反官僚主义，解决了一些生产上所积存的问题，使工人能积极地、自觉地为完成计划而努力。如一零一厂第一场在讨论计划前检查出生产上存在的主要问题，是质量不好，接着召集老工人、青年工人与技术人员会议进行研究；职工提出技术组织措施一百一十七条，保证了质量的提高和计划的完成。
    二、各厂领导方面抓紧了对计划执行情况的检查。如六一二厂党、行政、工会、青年团的干部经常下车间，了解“活不好作”的原因，对生产起了督促和改进作用；六零一厂领导干部亲自下车间对上半月生产不均衡情况及时加以检查，也使计划得以顺利完成。
    三、多数厂矿都展开了劳动竞赛，保证了生产计划的完成。五通桥金山寺盐厂发起竞赛后，卤水超额生产百分之一点二九至三点四三。
    五月份有些厂矿没有完成计划的原因主要是：
    一、没有认真贯彻操作规程，事故很多。如五零六厂，六天内连续发生事故八次；云南电业局发电厂五月份内发生大小事故三十多次，都影响了计划的完成。
    二、对关键问题抓得不紧，没有认真解决。如四零五煤矿领导方面已发现掘进工作落后于采煤，但没有认真组织力量加以解决，结果因掘进赶不上回采，采煤工作面垮塌，影响计划不能完成。
    三、没有充分发动群众、依靠群众解决生产中所存在的问题。如四川水泥厂的灰圈问题，二号水泥磨问题，长期得不到解决，新的操作方法也没有制定，工人意见很多，生产情绪不高。
    从五月份计划执行情况看，西南各厂矿目前还存在着以下几个问题：
    保守思想依然存在。五月份在二十五种主要产品中有十三种产品计划产量小于四月份的实际产量。这是应该引起警惕的。
    生产上的前松后紧现象还没有克服。五月份除少数厂矿和车间已做到均衡生产外，多数厂矿前松后紧的现象仍然存在。
    厂矿中无人负责现象严重。西南区有些厂矿许多工作和制度，如生产调度、订货工作、定额管理、原始记录等都无人负责。
    最后，现在天气炎热，工厂现场温度较高。各厂矿特别是冶金、纺织等厂应及时改善降温、通风、安全等设备，以保证安全生产和出勤率。
