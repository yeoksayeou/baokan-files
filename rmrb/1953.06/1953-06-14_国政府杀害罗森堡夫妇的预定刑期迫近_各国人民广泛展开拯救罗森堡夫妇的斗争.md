Xinhua News Agency, June 13th: As the Rosenbergs' execution date approaches, the struggle of people around the world to save the Rosenbergs intensifies further.

The latest developments in the Rosenberg case are as follows: after the New York Federal Court rejected defense attorney Bloch's request for a retrial for the Rosenbergs on June 5th, he presented new evidence on the 6th, requesting the New York Federal Court, the Court of Appeals, and the Supreme Court to retry the case. Now, the New York Federal Court and the Court of Appeals have unreasonably rejected this request on the 8th and 11th respectively. The Supreme Court will not make a decision until the 15th. The Rosenbergs' defense lawyer again submitted a request to the U.S. Supreme Court on the 13th to suspend the execution of the Rosenbergs.

The National Committee for Fair Trial of the Rosenberg Case in the United States organized a mass meeting in downtown New York City on the evening of the 11th. Rosenberg's mother appealed loudly to President Eisenhower at the meeting: "Don't kill them, they are innocent." She added: "This couple said last week: 'If we are killed, it is a murder of innocent people.' They stated the truth." New York University Professor Efran Cross denounced the U.S. government's murder of the Rosenbergs at the meeting, believing that this murder seriously damaged American justice and the hearts of the people. The committee announced at the meeting that it would organize a special "Freedom Train" from New York to Washington on Sunday. Those traveling on the train will join people from many other parts of the United States in a demonstration in front of the White House, demanding the release of the Rosenbergs.

The famous physicist Harold C. Urey gave a speech in Washington, believing that the persecution of the Rosenbergs was an "insult to logic and justice."

In Montreal, Canada, people held up banners and flags demanding the release of the Rosenbergs and demonstrated outside the U.S. Consulate. Patricia, chairman of the Canadian National Committee to Save the Rosenbergs, said that the committee "will continue to convey Canada's growing demand for the release of the Rosenbergs to the representatives of the U.S. government stationed in Canada."

In Europe, the call to save the Rosenbergs has spread throughout the region. The Polish "Workers' Forum" published an editorial, denouncing the U.S. reactionaries' conspiracy to murder the Rosenbergs. The editorial pointed out that the struggle to save the Rosenbergs must be strengthened, and all efforts must be made to achieve the victory of progressive and peaceful forces.

Some famous figures in German religious circles have also stepped forward to rescue the Rosenbergs. Pastor Wickler of Rügen Island asked Eisenhower in a letter "not to turn a deaf ear to the calls of millions of people around the world." Pastor Schmidt issued an appeal to all Christians, urging them to save the Rosenbergs. The West German bourgeois newspaper "Stuttgart News" commented: "The fate of the Rosenbergs has gradually ceased to be a legal issue and has become a humanitarian issue."

The French Catholic Committee for the Revision of the Rosenberg Case Verdict also issued a call for rescue: a group of French writers also asked Queen Elizabeth to intercede with Eisenhower.

The High Rabbi of the British Commonwealth, Brot, sent a letter to Eisenhower through the U.S. Embassy in London, asking him to save the lives of the Rosenbergs.

In Brussels, a group of lawyers from various parties requested the establishment of an international court to retry the Rosenberg case. The World Women's Congress held in Copenhagen passed a resolution calling on Eisenhower to revoke the death sentence against the Rosenbergs.

In the East, the Vietnamese "People's Weekly" also protested against the U.S. government's decision to murder the Rosenbergs. The Indonesian Federation of Trade Unions, the Indonesian Women's Awakening Association, and other groups issued announcements, telegraphed Eisenhower, or wrote letters to the U.S. Embassy in Indonesia, demanding that the Rosenbergs be spared the death penalty.

    美国政府杀害罗森堡夫妇的预定刑期迫近
    各国人民广泛展开拯救罗森堡夫妇的斗争
    【新华社十三日讯】罗森堡夫妇刑期迫近，全世界人民拯救罗森堡夫妇的斗争进一步深入展开。
    罗森堡夫妇案件最近几天的发展是，在六月五日纽约联邦法院拒绝了辩护律师布洛克对罗森堡夫妇的重审要求后，他在六日提出新的证据，要求纽约联邦法院、上诉法院和最高法院重审。现在，纽约联邦法院和上诉法院已分别于八日和十一日无理地拒绝了这一要求。最高法院要等到十五日才能作决定。罗森堡夫妇的辩护律师又于十三日向美国最高法院重新提出停止执行罗森堡夫妇的死刑的要求。
    美国争取罗森堡案公正裁决全国委员会于十一日晚在纽约市中心组织了群众大会，罗森堡的母亲在会上大声向艾森豪威尔总统呼吁：“不要杀害他们，他们是无罪的”。她又说：“这对夫妇在上一周还说过：‘如果我们被杀害的话，这是对无辜人民的谋害’。他们说明了真理。”纽约大学教授埃弗朗·克罗斯在大会上指斥美国政府对罗森堡夫妇的谋杀，认为这种谋杀使美国的司法与人心受到严重的打击。委员会在大会上宣布将于星期日组织专门的“要求释放列车”从纽约开往华盛顿。乘车前去的人将与来自美国其他许多地区的人一起在白宫前举行示威，要求释放罗森堡夫妇。
    著名物理学家哈罗德·克·尤雷在华盛顿发表谈话，认为迫害罗森堡夫妇一案乃是对于“逻辑和正义的凌辱”。
    在加拿大的蒙特利尔，人们高举着要求释放罗森堡夫妇的标语和旗帜在美国领事馆外示威。加拿大全国拯救罗森堡夫妇委员会主席帕特里奇发表谈话说，委员会“将继续把加拿大日益增长的对释放罗森堡夫妇的要求传达给驻在加拿大的美国政府的代表”。
    在欧洲，拯救罗森堡夫妇的呼声，传遍各地。波兰“工人论坛报”发表社论，痛斥美国反动派阴谋杀害罗森堡夫妇。社论指出，必须加强拯救罗森堡夫妇的斗争，尽一切力量取得进步与和平力量的胜利。
    德国的一些宗教界著名人士也都起来援救罗森堡夫妇。鲁根岛牧师维克勒特在一封信中要求艾森豪威尔“不要对全世界千百万人民的呼声装聋卖哑”。牧师施密特向全体基督教徒发出呼吁，要他们拯救罗森堡夫妇。西德资产阶级的报纸“斯图加特新闻”评论说：“罗森堡夫妇的命运已逐渐地不再是一个法律的问题，而成为一个人道的问题了。”
    法国天主教争取修改罗森堡案判决委员会也发出救援的呼声：有一批法国作家并要求伊丽莎白女王出面向艾森豪威尔交涉。
    英联邦大教长勃罗第经过美国驻伦敦大使馆转交给艾森豪威尔一封信，要求他拯救罗森堡夫妇的生命。
    在布鲁塞尔，属于各党派的一批律师要求成立国际法庭来重审罗森堡夫妇的案件。在哥本哈根举行的世界妇女大会通过决议，呼吁艾森豪威尔撤销对罗森堡夫妇的死刑判决。
    在东方，越南“人民周刊”也对美国政府杀害罗森堡夫妇的决定表示抗议。印尼总工会、印尼觉醒妇女协会及其它团体发表公告、打电报给艾森豪威尔或写信给美国驻印尼大使馆，要求免除罗森堡夫妇的死刑。
