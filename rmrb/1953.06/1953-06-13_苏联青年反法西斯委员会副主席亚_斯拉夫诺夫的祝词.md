Dear Comrades! Dear Friends!

	Please allow me, on behalf of the young men and women of the Soviet Union, to extend fraternal greetings and congratulations to the delegates of the Second National Congress of the All-China Youth Federation.
	We are very pleased to be able to congratulate, through you, the Chinese youth who are actively participating, together with their people, in the construction and consolidation of the new China.
	In the few years since the founding of People's China, magnificent historical transformations have been completed. The land reform has been basically completed, with millions of peasants receiving land. The national economy has been restored, creating conditions for the country's planned development towards industrialization. The People's Republic of China has widely launched a vigorous struggle to increase industrial and agricultural production.
	The historic achievements of the Chinese people under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong have aroused heartfelt joy and a sense of kinship among the Soviet youth towards the brotherly Chinese people.
	Soviet youth have always watched with great care the achievements of the young men and women of China, who are fighting alongside the entire nation for the complete victory of the people's democratic revolution and for lasting peace, freedom, and democracy. We have personally witnessed the active role played by Chinese youth in the people's revolution; now we see Chinese youth standing at the forefront of the mighty and increasingly prosperous People's Republic of China.
	Love for the motherland, striving to contribute more to the people, working as well as possible, and steadfastly working for peace and friendship among all nations – these are the emotions that summon young Chinese men and women to build meritorious services. We all know and love the young Chinese heroes. Soviet workers are very familiar with the name of the glorious technician Liu Lifu, whose team completed five years' worth of tasks in two years. Soviet female textile workers watch with affection the achievements of Chinese female spinner Hao Jianxiu.
	We also know of the achievements of many young farmers who have launched competitions to increase agricultural output and open up cultivated land. The labor achievements of advanced young farmers demonstrate how great the achievements of Chinese agriculture can be. The land reform has opened up broad prospects for agricultural production. The continuous construction of countless dikes along many rivers in China demonstrates the achievements of the Chinese people and young Chinese hydraulic engineers, whose outstanding labor has subdued the destructive power of Chinese rivers and made them serve the interests of the people.
	We also know how much effort young Chinese intellectuals have contributed to the cause of consolidating the Chinese people's democratic system and to the better future of their motherland.
	Our young men and women feel heartfelt joy for the rapid improvement of your national culture and the achievements in literature and art. They are very interested in reading novels and poems by Chinese writers and poets, listening to Chinese music, and singing Chinese songs.
	We Soviet youth understand very well the great labor enthusiasm and creativity you possess today. The immense joy you feel for victory is dear to us.
	Now, Soviet youth are completing, along with the entire nation, the great task of building communism in our country.
	The 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union showed the Soviet people the broad prospects of building a beautiful tomorrow—communism.
	Our new Five-Year Plan is a clear demonstration of the fundamental superiority of the socialist system over the capitalist system. The Fifth Five-Year Plan stipulates a huge speed of development in industry and agriculture. The level of industrial production in 1955 will be approximately 70 percent higher than in 1950, the output of industrial products will be twice as high as in 1940, and during the years of the Five-Year Plan, the national income will increase by at least 60 percent.
	The new Five-Year Plan strongly demonstrates the Party and the Soviet government's concern for further improving the material well-being of Soviet citizens. In our country, the highest law is to maximize the satisfaction of the material and cultural needs of the people. During the new Five-Year Plan, the wages of workers and staff will increase by 30 percent, while the income of farmers will increase by 40 percent. The living standards of the working people will almost double compared to before the war.
	The young generation of the Soviet Union has plunged into the magnificent peaceful construction underway in our country with their labor enthusiasm.
	Millions of young Soviet men and women working in the industrial sector are striving to improve their production achievements. Young people are widely using advanced technology, improving labor organization, and striving to improve their cultural and technical level. The Stakhanovite labor methods of Yuri Zhikov and Vasily Kolesov, Nina Yusina and Alexander Malyukina, Levchenko and Mukhanov, and other production experts are becoming increasingly popular. New Stakhanovite workers are added to the ranks of advanced workers every year and every day.
	The spinning worker Maria Gilina and weaving worker Ekaterina Kharkova, who work at the Kubavin Seine factory, proposed a new patriotic initiative. The young female workers suggested launching a competition to overfulfill the Five-Year Plan without adding additional raw materials. By working according to this method, the female spinners of this factory will manufacture fabrics worth 20 million rubles over the plan for the state.
	The initiative of Viktor Lazorenkov, a lathe operator at the Moscow "Fighter" factory, has also been widely promoted. After he adopted the rotary cutting method, one shift was able to complete ten work quotas.
	The builders of Moscow's huge buildings are very familiar with the working methods of Stakhanovite facing worker Bachura, who used this new working method to complete 1,400 percent of his quota.
	The Five-Year Plan has set great tasks before the young socialist agricultural workers. Young agricultural workers are waging a tenacious struggle to increase yields and plant new crops. Young breeders are also increasing the number of livestock and the output of livestock.
	The Soviet state is constantly concerned that Soviet youth can successfully master science, culture, and technology. The Fifth Five-Year Plan stipulates a new upsurge in cultural construction and an increase in Soviet schools. Conditions will be prepared for the complete realization of universal secondary education in the next Five-Year Plan period.
	Soviet institutions of higher learning will also achieve great achievements in the Fifth Five-Year Plan. By 1955, the number of graduating experts will double. The number of scientific workers trained through graduate studies will also double. During this period, many new schools and institutions of higher learning will be established.
	We and you know more clearly than anyone else how much peace is needed by those who are building, those who are working creatively, those who are constructing, and those who are working sincerely. Our people and the Soviet government, embodying the will of the people, consider it their sacred duty to use all means to oppose the dark forces of war. Based on the possibility of long-term coexistence and peaceful competition between two different systems—the capitalist system and the socialist system—the Soviet government has consistently and unwaveringly pursued a policy of peace, international cooperation, and development of trade relations between countries, implementing the program formulated by the Party and the government.
	Soviet youth are proud that our government was the first to declare: "There is no dispute that cannot be resolved peacefully on the basis of mutual agreement." This is the will of the Soviet youth embodied by the Soviet government, and it is also the will of all the Soviet people.
	The working people of the People's Republic of China have always unswervingly defended peace. Honest people in many countries have drawn new strength from the peaceful policies of People's China to oppose war, and have gained confidence, deeply believing that their great efforts will surely lead to a brilliant victory for the forces of peace.
	Young men and women from all over the world know that Chinese youth are loyal defenders of the cause of peace and active members of the World Federation of Democratic Youth. They are convinced that you will be faithful to the ideals of peace and democracy. The basis of their belief is the glorious cause created by the heroic youth of new China.
	Dear friends! The friendship between the two great nations of China and the Soviet Union, the friendship between the youth of our two countries, is being consolidated year by year and day by day. The great and permanent friendship of the people of our two countries, which accounts for one-third of all mankind, is a reliable guarantee for maintaining peace in the Far East and the world.
	Our friendship is a source of encouragement for progressive youth all over the world, and it strengthens the confidence of youth in all countries that the cause of peace will ultimately triumph.
	Finally, on behalf of all the young men and women of the Soviet Union, we wish Chinese youth new victories in the struggle to further prosper and strengthen their motherland, and in the struggle to consolidate world peace.
	Long live the youth who are building a new People's China, a glorious and great China, under the leadership of the People's Government and Comrade Mao Zedong!
	Long live the permanent and unbreakable friendship between the youth of China and the Soviet Union!
	May the unbreakable alliance between the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union be increasingly consolidated!
	Long live world peace! (Xinhua News Agency)

    苏联青年反法西斯委员会副主席亚·斯拉夫诺夫的祝词亲爱的同志们！亲爱的朋友们！
    请允许我代表苏联的男女青年向中华全国青年第二次代表大会的代表们致以兄弟般的敬礼和祝贺。
    我们很高兴能够通过你们向正在和自己人民一道积极参加新中国的建设与巩固新中国的中国青年祝贺。
    人民中国建国几年以来，完成了宏伟的历史性改造。土地改革已基本完成，千百万农民分得了土地，国民经济业已恢复，从而创造了条件，使国家的经济可以有计划地向工业化发展。中华人民共和国已广泛地展开了大力提高工农业生产的斗争。
    中国人民在中国共产党和毛泽东主席领导下所获得的历史性成就，在苏联青年中引起了衷心的喜悦和对中国兄弟人民的亲切之感。
    苏联青年永远是以极大的关怀来注视着正同全国人民一起为人民民主革命的彻底胜利，为持久的和平、自由与民主而斗争的中国青年男女的成就。我们亲自看到中国青年在人民革命中所起的积极作用；如今我们又看到中国青年正站在强大的日益繁荣的中华人民共和国人民队伍的最前列。
    热爱祖国，竭力对人民多贡献，尽量工作得更好，坚定地为各国人民之间的和平与友好而努力——正是这些情感召唤着中国青年男女去建立功勋，我们都很了解并敬爱中国的青年英雄。苏联工人们都很熟悉光荣的技工刘立富的名字，他的工作队在两年中完成了五年的任务。苏联的女纺织工满怀着友爱注视着中国女纺纱工郝建秀的成就。
    我们还知道许多青年农民的成就，他们为提高农产量，为开拓耕地面积而展开竞赛。先进青年农民的劳动功绩，证明着中国农业可以达到多么大的成就。土地改革为农业生产开辟了广阔的前途。在中国许多河流旁不断修筑起无数堤坝，证明着中国人民和中国青年水利工作者的成就，他们卓越的劳动制服了中国河流的破坏力，使它们服务于人民的利益。
    我们还知道：中国青年知识分子对于巩固中国人民民主制度的事业，对于自己祖国更美好的未来贡献了如何多的力量。
    我国青年男女为你们国家文化的迅速提高，以及文学和艺术的成就而感到衷心的喜悦。他们很有兴趣地阅读中国作家和诗人的小说、诗，听中国的音乐，唱中国歌。
    我们苏联青年是很了解你们今天所具有的那种巨大劳动热情和创造力的。你们为胜利而感到的莫大喜悦对我们是亲切的。
    现在苏联青年正与全国人民一起完成着在我国建成共产主义的伟大任务。
    苏联共产党第十九次代表大会给苏联人民展示了建成美好的明天——共产主义的广阔远景。
    我国新的五年计划是社会主义制度对资本主义制度根本的优越性的明显证明。第五个五年计划规定工农业发展的巨大速度。一九五五年工业生产的水平要比一九五○年提高约百分之七十，工业品产量比一九四○年增加二倍，而在五年计划的年代里，国民收入将至少增加百分之六十。
    新的五年计划强有力地表现出党和苏联政府对进
    一步提高苏联公民物质福利的关怀，在我国，最高的法则就是最大限度地满足人民物质与文化需要。在新的五年计划期间，工人和职员的工资要增加百分之三十，而农民的收入将增加百分之四十，劳动人民的生活水平与战前比较起来几乎提高了一倍。
    苏联年青的一代以自己的劳动热忱投入了正在我国进行着的壮丽的和平建设事业。
    千万个在工业部门工作的苏联男女青年为提高自己的生产成就而努力着。青年们广泛地运用了先进技术，改进劳动组织并力求提高自己的文化技术水平。尤里·吉科夫和瓦西里·科列索夫，尼纳·尤辛娜和亚历山大·马柳金娜，列夫钦科和穆哈诺夫等这些生产能手的斯塔哈诺夫劳动方法日益推广起来了。先进工人的队伍每年每天都有新的斯塔哈诺夫式工作者补充进去。
    在库巴维因细呢工厂工作的纺纱女工玛里亚·吉里娜和织布女工埃卡杰林娜·哈尔科娃提出了新的爱国主义倡议。青年女工们建议展开不另外增加原料材料而超额完成五年计划的竞赛。由于按照这个方法工作，这个工厂的纺纱女工们将给国家超计划制造价值二千万卢布的布匹。
    莫斯科“战士”工厂车工维克托·拉左连科夫的倡议也广泛地推广了。他采用了旋回切削法之后，一个工作班可以完成十个工作定额。
    莫斯科巨大建筑物的建设者们都非常熟悉镶面工人斯塔哈诺夫式工作者巴楚拉的工作方法，他运用这种新的工作方法完成了定额的百分之一千四百。
    五年计划在年青的社会主义农业劳动者的面前提出了伟大的任务。农业青年正为提高产量，种植新的作物进行着顽强的斗争。年青的饲养员们也在提高牲畜的头数和牲畜的产量。
    苏联国家所经常关心的就是苏联青年们能顺利地掌握科学文化和技术。第五个五年计划规定了文化建设的新的高涨和苏联学校的增加。为在下一个五年计划时期完全实现普遍的中等教育准备条件。
    苏联高等学校在第五个五年计划中也将获得巨大的成就。到一九五五年，毕业的专家人数将增加一倍。通过研究生培养出的科学工作干部也将增加一倍。在这一时期将建立起许多新的学校和高等学校。
    我们和你们比其他任何人都更清楚地知道，正在进行着建设的人，正在创造性地工作的人，正在进行修建的人，正在诚恳地劳动的人是多么地需要和平。我国人民和苏维埃政府体现着人民的意志，认为自己的神圣天职就是用一切办法来反对战争的黑暗势力。苏维埃政府根据两种不同制度——资本主义制度和社会主义制度——长期并存和进行和平竞赛的可能性出发，一贯地、坚定不移地奉行着和平、国际合作和发展各国间贸易关系的政策，实行着党和政府所制定的纲领。
    苏联青年感到自豪的就是我国政府第一个宣布了：“没有任何争端，不能在彼此协议的基础上通过和平的方式来解决。”这是苏维埃政府所体现的苏联青年底意志，也是全体苏联人民的意志。
    中华人民共和国的劳动人民始终不渝地保卫着和平。许多国家的正直人士都从人民中国的和平政策中汲取到新的力量去反对战争，从中获得了信心，深信自己的巨大努力一定会使和平力量得到辉煌的胜利。
    世界各国的男女青年都知道，中国青年是和平事业的忠实捍卫者，是世界民主青年联盟的积极会员。他们深信，你们一定会忠实于和平与民主的理想。他们这一信念的依据，就是新中国英勇的青年所创造出来的光辉的事业。
    亲爱的朋友们！中苏两大民族间的友谊，我们两国青年间的友谊一年比一年地，一天比一天地巩固起来了，占全人类三分之一的我们两国人民底伟大的、永久的友谊是保持远东和世界和平的可靠保证。
    我们的友谊是全世界进步青年取得鼓舞的源泉，它巩固着各国青年对于和平事业将最终胜利的信心。
    最后，我们代表苏联全体男女青年敬祝中国青年在争取祖国进一步繁荣富强的斗争中，在巩固世界和平的斗争中取得新的胜利。
    在人民政府和毛泽东同志的领导下建设着新的人民中国的、光荣的伟大中国的青年万岁！
    中苏两国青年之间的永久的牢不可破的友谊万岁！
    祝中华人民共和国和苏联之间的牢不可破的同盟日益巩固！
    全世界和平万岁！（新华社）
