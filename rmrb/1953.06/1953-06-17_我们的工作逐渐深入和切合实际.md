    Our Work is Gradually Deepening and Becoming More Practical
    Sui Xingchu, Secretary of the CPC Kunshan County Committee, Jiangsu Province
    Since the spring plowing production this year, the CPC Kunshan County Committee in Jiangsu Province has seen significant changes in the work style of leaders at all levels, due to the implementation of the spirit of the struggle against bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of law and discipline in practical work. Especially after studying the three documents, including the CPC Central Committee's instructions to party committees at all levels regarding spring plowing production, cadres have made flying progress in their understanding of agricultural production, and in the transformation and improvement of their leadership styles and methods. New situations, different from previous years, have emerged.
    In the past, when arranging work, we did not see that "our starting point for advancement is the small-scale peasant economy," and often started from subjective imagination. Last autumn, the county committee, without considering the actual conditions of the county, simultaneously arranged five tasks: selecting wheat seeds with salt water, applying base fertilizer to wheat fields, and uprooting rice stalks, etc., and rigidly stipulated that these five tasks must be completed 100%. In terms of work methods, it was about launching challenges and responses and "using meetings to get through ideological blockages." This resulted in two consequences among township and village cadres: First, they dealt with superiors perfunctorily and falsely reported achievements. Cadres in the Diandong District guaranteed to the district party secretary and district head that they would complete 100%, but behind their backs said: "Guaranteeing completion is to save face for the district party secretary and district head, but the task is difficult to complete." Second, there was widespread coercion, commandism, and detachment from the masses. Not only could they not complete the tasks 100%, but they also ruined good things. In some places, the selected rice seeds were green, the salt water selection of seeds was fake, and the land where spring-ripening crops were hindered due to uprooting rice stalks reached more than 10,000 mu throughout the county. Under the domination of subjectivist leadership thinking, the blind promotion of sparse planting of rice in paddy fields last year resulted in only one of the twelve 1,000-jin households cultivated in 1951 achieving 1,000 jin last year. The phenomenon of departmentalism in various departments was also more serious. Regardless of the production season and the farmers' production situation, each department emphasized its own work; however, the county party committee did not pay attention to this issue and adopted a liberal attitude of trying to "take care" of the work of each department in order to win the praise of comrades in various departments for the "party committee's attention." As a result, serious chaos was created in the countryside. Last October, Penglang District Xiyi Township had seven central tasks, and various departments competed with each other for the center. Bank and cooperative cadres quarreled at meetings in order to rush to complete the tasks of their respective departments, and the farmers had to help them mediate. Furthermore, district-level cadres spent more time looking at things superficially and less time understanding specific situations; they paid more attention to small and trivial details and less attention to grasping central issues; they gave many speeches at meetings but provided little help to farmers in solving specific problems. Therefore, the work was not done well, production was delayed, farmers were dissatisfied, and cadres were also very depressed.
    Based on the above situation, we first solved the chaotic phenomenon in rural work and ensured that agricultural production truly became the central work in the countryside. On this issue, in addition to organizing county, district, and township cadres to study the central government's instructions on spring plowing production and other documents, the county party committee, on the basis of improving the ideological understanding of cadres, on the one hand, cleaned up the work assigned downward by the county-level departments directly under its jurisdiction, and reduced, postponed, or cancelled work that hindered production; those that could not be postponed or cancelled were combined with production. For example, the grain company's investigation of the number of geese, ducks, pigs, and sheep raised by farmers, and the cooperative's registration of members, etc., could not be combined with production, so they were postponed or suspended. At the same time, the county party committee also began to pay attention to strengthening contact with various departments, so that the leaders of various departments could promptly understand the county party committee's deployment of rural work, so as to organically arrange their own work and appropriately combine departmental work with production work. On the other hand, the county party committee also formulated "Eight Regulations to Ensure that Rural Production is the Overriding Central Work" based on the actual conditions of the county, which played a great role in strengthening unified leadership and reducing the "five excesses" phenomenon. For example, after the Eight Regulations were announced to the masses, if the staff of the Diandong District Bank went to the countryside to hold meetings without the approval of the district head, the cadres and farmers could ignore them. At the same time, farmers were able to actively participate in meetings convened in accordance with the regulations and arrive on time. They also dared to raise opinions about cadres who dragged out meeting times without following the regulations. In order to reduce the layers of meetings and quickly implement work tasks, the county party committee also changed the past method of sitting at home and holding large meetings. Not long ago, members of the county party committee twice went to various districts to directly convene enlarged meetings of district and township cadres to convey and arrange work. Cadres below reflected: "This approach shortens meeting times, solves more problems, and allows for quicker meetings with the masses. Township and village cadres have ample time to participate in and lead production." Due to the above measures taken by the county party committee, the "five excesses" phenomenon in the countryside has been basically eliminated, and cadres and the masses have responded very well. Some of the masses said: "In previous years, if we wanted to go out to accumulate fertilizer, the cadres would keep us at home to hold meetings to challenge and respond; this year, there is less empty talk at meetings, and the people's production is better than in previous years."
    After having a clear understanding of the center of agricultural production work, the difficulties of township and village cadres participating in and leading production were basically resolved. After the anti-bureaucracy struggle, the county party committee stipulated and promoted measures for township cadres to take turns on duty during the day, understand production conditions and solve problems in designated areas at night, and hold regular brainstorming sessions to exchange experiences and plan work. When inspecting and deploying work, county and district officials tried not to hold large meetings, or to hold fewer of them, and to spend more time going down to the villages to understand production conditions and help township cadres solve specific problems. This approach generally achieved good results, with "the masses satisfied, mutual aid teams satisfied, township cadre families satisfied, and the cadres themselves satisfied." Township cadres reflected: "The burden of the past three years has been lifted this year." "Last year, the people scolded us for talking empty words and boasting; this year, the masses are willing to listen to us." The broad masses said: "This year's production is of utmost importance. There are fewer meetings in the district and township, and cadres are running down to the villages every day. If the village cadres' production is good, the people will definitely follow."
    The more important gain for cadres at all levels in Kunshan County is that their work style has undergone a great change. They have begun to go deep into reality and into the masses, overcoming the phenomenon of empty shouts for production that were not in line with reality in the past. This is prominently manifested in the promotion of agricultural technology, advocating the cultivation of "teachers" and achieving "taking materials locally and promoting them locally." The cadres were asked to "learn what they do, summarize what they do, and promote what they do," and to "find models for everything and find examples for everything." According to different seasons, it was proposed that "whatever you do, you should look for the appropriate typical example." The township cadres were given the slogan of "participate in the production of their own mutual aid teams, absorb local advanced experience, set an example, and lead the farmers to produce." The county party committee also planned to cultivate "teachers" with advanced experience in various aspects of production during the various periods of sowing, transplanting seedlings, fertilizing, and irrigating, introduce relevant production experiences, and promptly promote production work. During the spring plowing production period, a total of 2,143 "teachers" of various types were cultivated throughout the county, and more than 4,500 activists participated in technical research meetings to listen to the "teachers" impart their knowledge. In addition, the county party committee also arranged for cadres who went to the countryside to collect a large number of agricultural proverbs, study and analyze agricultural proverbs, and correctly use agricultural proverbs to promote agricultural production, and this aspect has also made considerable achievements. For example, "In order to have a good harvest, dredge the mud and collect aquatic plants" promoted fertilizer accumulation work, and "Deep plowing by one inch yields an extra 10%," and "Plow deeply and dry in the sun" promoted plowing work. Because we adopted the working method of "from the masses, to the masses" to educate the masses, the masses were able to consciously and willingly accept it. When the "teacher" in Xiyi Township, Penglang District, conducted a transplanting seedling experiment on waste fields, more than 100 farmers automatically came to visit and展开 a heated discussion. It is precisely because various places use "teachers" to hold various chats and research meetings, introduce experiences, and combine setting examples to educate the masses and lead production, that the rigid method of "hard-core bombing at large and small meetings" in the past has been changed, and the old-fashioned meeting method of one report, two discussions, three speeches, four challenges, and five summaries has also been changed. Therefore, the masses reflected: "This year, the comrades in charge of production are different. The people talk more, and the comrades in charge talk less." "The comrades in charge talk more like the people, and less like outsiders." Zhou Shu District's district and township cadres checked and summarized the transformation of leadership style, and believed that there were thirteen differences compared with previous years after the transformation of work style, such as "Last year, there were many meetings and many slogans, this year, more fertilizer was accumulated, more fields were plowed, and production was better," "Last year's typical examples were made by the comrades in charge, today's typical examples are the real people and real events of the people," etc., which shows that our transformation of work style is welcomed by the broad masses of cadres and people.
    However, our transformation of leadership style and improvement of leadership methods are only just beginning, and the new leadership methods are only budding and are not yet complete. At the same time, there are still a few cadres who feel depressed and waver in the face of the new leadership methods. This fully shows that the transformation of work style is not an easy task, but a difficult process of ideological struggle. In addition to educating cadres in practical work with methods such as "checking work style, comparing work, looking at results, finding reasons, and thinking of solutions," the county party committee also recently convened a meeting of main cadres from various districts, and through summarizing spring plowing production, focused on summarizing the achievements since the transformation of leadership style, pointed out the remaining problems, launched ideological criticism, and discussed how to further improve leadership methods through practical work. In this way, the role of consolidating the achieved results and educating cadres to continue to move forward is very great. A district party secretary said: "Improving leadership methods is the first time I have solved this problem in my work history." The general reflection is: "Since this spring, great progress has been made, and the enthusiasm for work has increased compared with previous years. With the transformation of leadership style, I am also more at ease with rural work." (Originally published in Nanjing Xinhua Daily)

### 我们的工作逐渐深入和切合实际

    我们的工作逐渐深入和切合实际
    中共江苏昆山县委书记  隋性初
    中共江苏昆山县委从今年春耕生产以来，由于在实际工作中贯彻了反对官僚主义、反对命令主义、反对违法乱纪斗争的精神，各级领导作风有了很大的转变。特别在学习了中共中央关于春耕生产给各级党委的指示等三个文件以后，干部无论在对农业生产的认识上，在领导作风、领导方法的转变和改进上，都有了飞跃的进步，出现了与往年不同的新情况。
    过去，在布置工作时，没有看到“我们前进的出发点是小农经济”，常常是从主观想像出发。去年秋季，县委不根据本县的实际情况，同时布置盐水选麦种、麦田施基肥、拔稻根等五项工作，而又硬性规定这五项任务都要百分之百的完成。工作方法上则是发动挑战应战和“开会打通思想”。这样在乡、村干部中产生两种后果：一是对上应付，假报成绩。淀东区的干部对区委书记、区长口口声声保证百分之百完成，背后说：“保证完成是给区委书记和区长留点面子，任务是很难完成的。”一是普遍的强迫命令、脱离群众，不仅不能百分之百的完成任务，反而把好事情办坏了，有些地方选的稻种是青的，盐水选种是假的，因拔稻根而妨碍种春熟作物的田全县达万余亩。在主观主义领导思想的支配下，去年又盲目推广稻田稀植，致使一九五一年培养的十二个千斤户，去年只有一户收到千斤。各个部门的分散主义现象也较严重，不问生产季节，不根据农民的生产情况，各自强调部门工作；而县委没有重视这一问题，采取了尽量“照顾”各部门工作的自由主义态度，以博取各部门同志的“党委重视”的赞扬。因此，造成了农村严重的混乱现象。蓬阆区?晞乡去年十月份就有七个中心工作，各个部门又相互争夺中心，银行与合作社干部为了抢着完成本部门的任务而在会议上争吵，农民群众反过来帮助他们调解。再就是区级干部检查工作是走马看花多，了解具体情况少；注意细小琐碎枝节事情多，掌握中心问题差；开会讲话多，帮助农民解决具体问题少。因此，工作搞不好，生产耽误了，农民不满，干部也很苦闷。
    根据以上情况，我们首先解决农村工作中的忙乱现象，切实保证农业生产真正在乡村中形成为中心工作。在这个问题上，县委除了组织县、区、乡干部学习中央关于春耕生产的指示等文件外，并在干部提高思想认识的基础上，一方面将县直属机关向下布置的工作作了一番清理，对妨碍生产的工作则予以减少、推迟或取消；不能推迟或取消的就结合在生产中进行。如粮食公司要调查农民中养鹅、鸭、猪、羊的数字，合作社要进行社员登记等工作，不能和生产结合，就推迟或停止了。同时县委也开始注意加强和各部门的联系，使各部门的领导上及时了解县委对农村工作的部署，以便有机地安排自己的工作，并使部门工作适当地和生产工作结合起来。另一方面，县委也根据本县的实际情况，作出“确保农村生产为压倒一切中心工作的八项规定”，这对加强统一领导、减少“五多”现象，起了很大作用。如八项规定向群众公布后，淀东区银行的工作人员不经过区长批准，随便到乡村里开会，干部农民就可以不理睬。同时，农民对按照规定召开的会议，都能积极参加，按时到会。他们对不执行规定拖长会议时间的干部，也敢于提出意见。为了减少会议层次，迅速地将工作任务贯彻下去，县委也改变了过去坐在家里开大会的方法。不久之前，县委委员曾两次分头到各区直接召开区、乡干部扩大会传达布置工作。下面干部反映说：“这样做法，开会时间短，解决问题多，和群众见面快，乡、村干部有充裕时间参加生产和领导生产。”由于县委采取了以上的措施，农村的“五多”现象已基本消灭，干部、群众都反映很好。有的群众说：“往年我们要出门积肥，干部就要把我们留在家里开会挑战、应战；今年开会说空话少，老百姓的生产就比往年搞的好。”
    对农业生产工作的中心有了明确的认识后，乡、村干部参加生产领导生产的困难基本上得到解决。县委在反官僚主义斗争以后，规定和推广了乡干部白天轮流值日，晚上分片了解生产情况和解决问题，定期开碰头会交流经验和计划工作的措施。县、区在检查、布置工作时，尽量的不开或少开大型会议，多向下跑，利用生产空隙了解生产情况，并帮助乡干部解决具体问题。这样做普遍收到“群众满意、互助组满意、乡干部家庭满意、干部自己满意”的良好效果。乡干部反映说：“三年来的包袱今年解除了”，“去年老百姓骂我们空喊吹牛，今年我们讲话群众愿意听了。”广大群众这样说：“今年的生产顶重要，区乡开会少，干部天天向下跑，乡村干部生产好，老百姓一定跟着跑。”
    昆山县各级干部更重要的收获是工作作风有了很大的转变，开始深入实际深入群众，克服了过去不切合实际的空喊生产的现象。这突出地表现在推广农业技术方面，提倡培养“老师”，做到“就地取材，就地推广”。在干部中提出“做什么学什么，总结什么，推广什么”，“样样找典型，事事找样子”，根据不同的季节，提出“做什么就去找什么样的典型”等要求。对乡干部提出“参加自己的互助组生产，吸收当地的先进经验，作出样子，领导农民生产”的口号。县委并计划在播种、莳秧、施肥、灌溉各个时期培养对各方面生产有先进经验的“老师”，介绍有关方面的生产经验，及时地推动生产工作。在春耕生产期间，全县共培养各种“老师”二千一百四十三名，参加技术研究会听“老师”传授的积极分子有四千五百多人。另外，县委还布置各个下乡的干部大量搜集农谚，研究分析农谚，正确地运用农谚来推动农业生产，这方面也做出了不小成绩，例如：以“为了收成好，罱泥捞水草”推动了积肥工作，以“深耕一寸，多收一成”、“犁得深，晒得醒”，推动了犁田工作。由于我们采取了“从群众中来，到群众中去”的工作方法教育群众，因而群众能自觉地、乐意地接受。蓬阆区?晞乡在“老师”利用废田作莳秧试验时，就有一百多农民自动地前来参观，并展开热烈的讨论。正由于各地运用“老师”开各种漫谈会、研究会，介绍经验，结合做样子来教育群众领导生产，因而改变了过去“大会小会硬套硬轰”的生硬办法，也改变了过去开起会来一报告、二讨论、三发言、四挑战、五总结老一套的会议方法。因此群众反映说：“今年工作同志领导生产两样了，老百姓讲话多，工作同志讲话少了。”“工作同志讲老百姓的话多了，讲外行话少了。”周墅区区乡干部检查、总结转变领导作风时，认为转变作风后与往年相比有十三个不同的地方，如“去年开会多、口号多，今年肥料积得多、田犁得多、生产搞得好”、“去年的典型是工作同志做出来的，今天的典型是老百姓的真人真事”等，这说明我们作风的转变是获得广大干部和群众欢迎的。
    但是，我们转变领导作风、改进领导方法还仅是开始，新的领导方法才在萌芽，还不够完整。同时还有少数干部在新的领导方法面前感到苦闷和动摇。这充分说明转变作风不是一件轻而易举的事情，而是一个艰苦的思想斗争过程。县委除了在实际工作中以“查作风、比工作、看成果、找原因、想办法”等方法教育干部外，又于最近召开各区主要干部会议，通过总结春耕生产，重点地总结了转变领导作风以来的成绩，指出尚存在的问题，展开了思想批判，并讨论了如何通过实际工作更进一步地改进领导方法。这样，对巩固既得的成果，教育干部继续前进的作用很大。有的区委书记说：“改善领导方法，在我的工作历史上还是第一次解决的问题。”一般的反映是：“今春以来，进步很大，工作积极性比往年提高了，随着领导作风的转变，对农村工作也安心了。”       （原载南京新华日报）
