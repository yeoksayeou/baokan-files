    Creating and Promoting Experiences of Combining Elections with Production
    The pilot work for key points in grassroots elections has begun successively in many regions. We must strive to do the pilot work well, set an example for the entire grassroots election work, and promote the victorious completion of the election work. At present, in the key point pilot work, a set of mature experiences is needed for population surveys, voter registration, candidate nomination, holding elections, and convening township people's congresses. Shandong, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, and other places have already explored some specific methods for handling population surveys and voter registration, which are valuable. In order to truly promote the pilot experiences, all localities must also pay attention to creating a set of experiences suitable for their local practical needs, especially in combination with production, and make these experiences the experiences of local cadres themselves.
    In the pilot work for key points in grassroots elections, many places have already paid attention to the close integration of elections with production. For example, when the election workers in the first district of Licheng County, Shandong, arrived in various townships, they first assisted the township government committees in summarizing the production work of the previous stage; then, in their work, they also helped solve the problems of undemocratic work styles and unfair practices of some cadres in mutual aid teams, implemented clear accounting, and increased the enthusiasm of the masses for production, as well as stimulating their enthusiasm for participating in the general election. The Hunan Provincial Election Committee determined that grassroots election work must be closely integrated with production from beginning to end, so that all election work is carried out during the gaps in agricultural production. For example, some areas actively prepare for flood prevention before the flood season arrives, and at the same time, take time to prepare for elections; when the flood season arrives, they devote all their efforts to flood prevention, and after the flood season, they combine production with elections. The Sichuan Provincial Election Committee Office sent grassroots election work inspection teams to typical pilot areas to assist in summarizing the experiences of combining elections with production. These are all very good.
    However, there are also signs that some places have not paid attention to combining election work with production. For example, a correspondent from Xiping Township, a key pilot township for grassroots elections in Zhangming County, Sichuan, wrote: "From May 7th to 14th, meetings were held every night in each village, making the village cadres and representatives dissatisfied, saying: 'We engage in production during the day and hold meetings at night. How can we do production well?'" The cadres there said that they wanted to combine elections with production when arranging work, but in practice, they rarely combined them; when reporting on work, they rarely talked about production. The Secretary of the Zhangming County Committee of the Communist Party of China said when arranging work in the county: "The arrangement of time for elections and production, both have the same weight." The county cadres responsible for leading the election work in that township did not study production very well either. When someone asked him how production was going, he only said, "Find two or three typical demonstrations." It can be seen from this that: first, the reality of production is being squeezed out; second, the working method is still holding meetings every night. This situation must be changed.
    We must carry out the pilot work for key points in grassroots elections with the spirit of anti-bureaucracy. The propaganda work and other specific work in each stage of the pilot grassroots election must be truly combined with the actual situation and with production, and should not be carried out subjectively and in isolation. This requires that when arranging the work for each stage of the pilot grassroots election, we must also arrange production in detail at the same time, and formulate a unified specific plan for combined implementation. The so-called "combination" is not "both have the same weight," but that elections must be subordinate to production, and we must earnestly implement the central government's instructions to take production as the overriding central task. When there is a serious contradiction between the election and the production requirements of the masses, we would rather postpone the election slightly than affect production and delay agricultural time. In areas that have suffered serious natural disasters, we must first lead the masses in production and disaster relief. Secondly, when carrying out the election pilot work, we must first understand the local production situation, help solve the problems of the masses in production, and then use the gaps in production to carry out the election pilot work. In places where the problem of "five excesses" is particularly serious, we must first help solve the problem of "five excesses." At the same time, we must try to simplify all the procedures of election work to make it simple and easy to implement; meetings should be well prepared, small meetings should be held as much as possible, so that the meetings are short and to the point, and solve problems; even using rainy days or the time after dinner should be very cautious and economical; meetings should be reduced to a minimum, and meetings that are not absolutely necessary should not be held at all; whether holding meetings, conducting investigations, or registering, staff should be more careful, walk more, and not let the masses walk more or delay their work. The principle is to do everything possible not to delay the masses' production time and sleep time. During the busy farming season, we should also help the masses' production as much as possible.
    In propaganda work, we should also pay special attention to the principle of "less but精 (concise and effective)," do not speak too long, wasting time and making the masses bored. This requires making full preparations before propaganda, so that the content of propaganda meets the actual needs, is simple and clear, grasps the main problems of the locality, and explains the relationship between the general election and solving these practical problems to the masses. For example, if there are bad elements in power locally, and the people are mainly afraid of not being able to elect out the bad elements, the propagandist should explain in detail the relevant provisions in the general election that protect the people's democratic rights from infringement and restriction, and the relevant provisions in the review of voter qualifications and the nomination of candidates, so that the people are convinced that their goal of electing out the bad elements can be achieved in the general election, and their enthusiasm will be improved. If the local people are eagerly demanding to build water conservancy, the propagandist should call on everyone to elect the person they think is most suitable to lead the construction of water conservancy in the general election, and everyone's enthusiasm will naturally be improved. When Shahe Township, Licheng County, Shandong, promoted the general election this time, it used facts familiar to the masses to illustrate the relationship between democracy and production, with very good results. Last year, when the township built irrigation ditches, the cadres had a bureaucratic work style, and the ditches were built but could not carry water, causing great losses to the masses; this year, when digging irrigation ditches, democracy was promoted, the dug ditches occupied less land and irrigated more land, and the masses were very satisfied. The propaganda of this case greatly increased the enthusiasm of the masses for implementing democracy and the general election. In this regard, many comrades who have done practical work in the past have not paid much attention. In this pilot grassroots election, we should strive to overcome this shortcoming and create experience in carrying out vivid propaganda in conjunction with the needs of the masses.
    In short, in this typical pilot project, we must create and promote the experience of running elections well in combination with production, in order to have a practical and effective typical demonstration effect on the entire grassroots election. In order for the experience of the pilot election to be mastered and promoted by the majority of grassroots cadres, the working group must pay attention to: first, before the work begins, explain to the local cadres the content of the election work, the general purpose, and the purpose of the work in each stage, explain the policy boundaries and working methods, and then let the local cadres discuss and formulate specific work plans and steps by themselves, and proceed step by step. The working group only provides conscientious guidance and help, and tries to prevent monopolization and substitution. Second, in the process of work, point out the good and bad, correct and wrong practices of the local cadres at any time, so that they can correct deviations and errors in time, and understand the reasons behind them. Third, when each stage of work is completed, help the local cadres to recall their own work process, recall the problems encountered and the process of solving them, study various successful and failed experiences, draw out the knowledge of the laws of work, and make plans for the next step of work. In summary, we must let local cadres use their own brains, come up with their own ideas, think of their own ways, and be responsible for their own work. Only in this way can the experience of the pilot project have realistic significance.

### 创造和推广结合生产进行选举的经验

    创造和推广结合生产进行选举的经验
    基层选举的重点试办工作，已经在许多地区先后开始。我们必须努力把试办工作做好，给整个基层选举工作做出榜样，以促进选举工作的胜利完成。目前，在重点试办工作中，对于人口调查、选民登记、候选人提名、举行选举、召开乡人民代表大会等项工作，都需要有一套成熟的经验。山东、浙江、江西等地，已经摸索出办理人口调查和选民登记的若干具体做法，这是珍贵的。为了使试办的经验真正能够推广，各地还必须注意创造一套适合当地实际需要，特别是结合生产的经验，并使这些经验成为当地干部自己的经验。
    在基层选举重点试办中，有许多地方已经注意了密切结合生产的问题。如山东历城县第一区的普选工作人员到达各乡，首先协助乡政府委员会总结了前一阶段的生产工作；接着在工作中又帮助解决了互助组中某些干部作风不民主、办事不公平的问题，实行了清工算账，提高了群众的生产热情，也激发了群众参加普选的积极性。湖南省选举委员会确定基层选举工作必须自始至终密切结合生产，使全部选举工作都在农业生产的空隙中进行。如有的地区在防汛工作尚未到来前，积极准备防汛，同时抽出时间准备选举，汛期到来时即全力防汛，汛期结束后再结合生产进行选举。四川省选举委员会办公室派出基层选举工作检查组到典型试办地区，协助总结选举和生产结合进行的经验。这些都是很好的。
    但也有迹象说明，有些地方没有注意把选举工作和生产结合。如四川彰明县基层选举的重点试办乡——西屏乡一个通讯员来信说：从五月七日开始到十四日的八天中，各村每晚开会，闹得村干部和代表都不满意，说：“我们白天搞生产，夜里开会，究竟怎样搞得好生产？”那里的干部在布置工作时说是要结合生产，实际做起来很少结合；汇报工作时也很少谈生产。中共彰明县县委书记在县里布置工作时说：“选举和生产时间的安排，两种都是一样的比重。”负责领导该乡选举工作的县干部也没有很好研究生产。有人问他生产怎样搞，他只说“找二三户典型示范。”从这里可以看出：第一、生产实际是被挤掉了；第二、工作方法还是每晚开会。这种情况必须加以改变。
    我们必须用反官僚主义的精神去进行基层选举的重点试办工作。试办基层选举的各个工作阶段上的宣传工作和其他具体工作，都必须真正结合实际情况，结合生产去进行，而不应该主观地、孤立地去进行。这就要求在布置基层选举重点试办的各个段落的工作时，必须同时详细地布置生产，订出统一的结合进行的具体计划。所谓“结合”，并不是“两种都是一样的比重”，而是选举必须服从生产，必须切实贯彻中央指示，把生产作为压倒一切的中心工作。在选举和群众生产要求发生严重矛盾时，宁可稍为推迟选举，不能影响生产，耽误农时。在遭受严重天灾的地方，更要首先领导群众进行生产救灾。其次，在进行选举试办工作时，必须首先了解当地生产的情况，帮助解决群众生产方面的问题，然后利用生产空隙来进行选举试办工作。在“五多”问题特别严重的地方，首先要帮助解决“五多”问题。同时要尽量简化选举工作的一切手续，使之简便易行；开会要有充分准备，尽量召开小型会，使会议开得短小精干，解决问题，就是利用雨天或晚饭以后的时间，也要十分慎重，十分节约；会议要减至最低限度，凡是不是十分必要的会，就根本不要开；无论开会、调查、登记，工作人员要多用心，多走路，不要让群众多走路，多误工。原则是尽一切可能不要耽误群众的生产时间和睡眠时间。在农忙时节，还要尽可能帮助群众的生产。
    在宣传工作上，也要特别注意“少而精”的原则，不要讲得冗长，耽误时间，使群众厌烦。这就要求在宣传之前作充分的准备，使宣传的内容切合实际需要，讲得简单明了，抓住当地的主要问题，把普选和解决这些实际问题的关系向群众说清楚。比如，当地有坏分子在当权，人民主要是害怕选不掉坏分子，宣传员就要详细地讲解普选中保障人民民主权利不受侵犯和限制的有关规定，选民资格审查和候选人提名中的有关规定，使人民确信他们选掉坏分子的目的能在普选中达到，他们的积极性就会提高。当地人民如果迫切要求兴修水利，宣传员就要号召大家在普选中把自己认为最适合于领导兴修水利的人选举出来，大家的积极性自然也会提高。山东历城县沙河乡此次宣传普选时，以群众熟悉的事实说明民主与生产的关系，效果很好。该乡去年修灌溉沟时，干部有官僚主义作风，沟修好了不能通水，群众受了很大损失；今年挖灌溉沟时发扬了民主，挖的沟占地少，灌地多，群众很满意。这一事例的宣传，大大提高了群众对实行民主和普选的积极性。在这一方面，过去有许多做实际工作的同志很不注意。在这次试办基层选举中应该努力克服这种毛病，创造结合群众要求进行生动宣传的经验。
    总之，在这次典型试办中我们必须创造和推广结合生产办好选举的经验，才能对整个基层选举发生切实有效的典型示范作用。为了使试办选举的经验能为广大基层干部所掌握和推广，工作组必须注意：第一、在工作开始之前，要向当地干部说明这次选举的工作内容、总的目的和各段落工作的目的，交代政策界线和工作方法，然后让当地干部自己讨论制订具体的工作计划和步骤，逐步进行。工作组只给以认真负责的指导和帮助，尽量防止包办代替。第二、在工作过程中，要随时指出当地干部好的和不好的、正确的和错误的作法，使他们及时纠正偏向和错误，并懂得其中道理。第三、在做完各段工作时，帮助当地干部去回想自己的工作过程，回想遇到的问题和解决的经过，研究各种成功的和失败的经验，得出工作规律性的知识，并做出下一步工作的计划。总起来说，我们一定要让当地干部自己动脑筋、出主意、想办法，自己负责去工作。必须这样，才能使试办的经验具有现实的意义。
