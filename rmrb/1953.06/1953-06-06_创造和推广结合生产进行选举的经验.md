    Creating and Promoting Experiences of Combining Elections with Production
    The pilot work for key points in grassroots elections has begun successively in many regions. We must strive to do the pilot work well, set an example for the entire grassroots election work, and promote the victorious completion of the election work. At present, in the key point pilot work, a set of mature experiences is needed for population surveys, voter registration, candidate nomination, holding elections, and convening township people's congresses. Shandong, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, and other places have already explored some specific methods for handling population surveys and voter registration, which are valuable. In order to truly promote the pilot experiences, all localities must also pay attention to creating a set of experiences suitable for their local practical needs, especially in combination with production, and make these experiences the experiences of local cadres themselves.
    In the pilot work for key points in grassroots elections, many places have already paid attention to the close integration of elections with production. For example, when the election workers in the first district of Licheng County, Shandong, arrived in various townships, they first assisted the township government committees in summarizing the production work of the previous stage; then, in their work, they also helped solve the problems of undemocratic work styles and unfair practices of some cadres in mutual aid teams, implemented clear accounting, and increased the enthusiasm of the masses for production, as well as stimulating their enthusiasm for participating in the general election. The Hunan Provincial Election Committee determined that grassroots election work must be closely integrated with production from beginning to end, so that all election work is carried out during the gaps in agricultural production. For example, some areas actively prepare for flood prevention before the flood season arrives, and at the same time, take time to prepare for elections; when the flood season arrives, they devote all their efforts to flood prevention, and after the flood season, they combine production with elections. The Sichuan Provincial Election Committee Office sent grassroots election work inspection teams to typical pilot areas to assist in summarizing the experiences of combining elections with production. These are all very good.
    However, there are also signs that some places have not paid attention to combining election work with production. For example, a correspondent from Xiping Township, a key pilot township for grassroots elections in Zhangming County, Sichuan, wrote: "From May 7th to 14th, meetings were held every night in each village, making the village cadres and representatives dissatisfied, saying: 'We engage in production during the day and hold meetings at night. How can we do production well?'" The cadres there said that they wanted to combine elections with production when arranging work, but in practice, they rarely combined them; when reporting on work, they rarely talked about production. The Secretary of the Zhangming County Committee of the Communist Party of China said when arranging work in the county: "The arrangement of time for elections and production, both have the same weight." The county cadres responsible for leading the election work in that township did not study production very well either. When someone asked him how production was going, he only said, "Find two or three typical demonstrations." It can be seen from this that: first, the reality of production is being squeezed out; second, the working method is still holding meetings every night. This situation must be changed.
    We must carry out the pilot work for key points in grassroots elections with the spirit of anti-bureaucracy. The propaganda work and other specific work in each stage of the pilot grassroots election must be truly combined with the actual situation and with production, and should not be carried out subjectively and in isolation. This requires that when arranging the work for each stage of the pilot grassroots election, we must also arrange production in detail at the same time, and formulate a unified specific plan for combined implementation. The so-called "combination" is not "both have the same weight," but that elections must be subordinate to production, and we must earnestly implement the central government's instructions to take production as the overriding central task. When there is a serious contradiction between the election and the production requirements of the masses, we would rather postpone the election slightly than affect production and delay agricultural time. In areas that have suffered serious natural disasters, we must first lead the masses in production and disaster relief. Secondly, when carrying out the election pilot work, we must first understand the local production situation, help solve the problems of the masses in production, and then use the gaps in production to carry out the election pilot work. In places where the problem of "five excesses" is particularly serious, we must first help solve the problem of "five excesses." At the same time, we must try to simplify all the procedures of election work to make it simple and easy to implement; meetings should be well prepared, small meetings should be held as much as possible, so that the meetings are short and to the point, and solve problems; even using rainy days or the time after dinner should be very cautious and economical; meetings should be reduced to a minimum, and meetings that are not absolutely necessary should not be held at all; whether holding meetings, conducting investigations, or registering, staff should be more careful, walk more, and not let the masses walk more or delay their work. The principle is to do everything possible not to delay the masses' production time and sleep time. During the busy farming season, we should also help the masses' production as much as possible.
    In propaganda work, we should also pay special attention to the principle of "less butç²¾ (concise and effective)," do not speak too long, wasting time and making the masses bored. This requires making full preparations before propaganda, so that the content of propaganda meets the actual needs, is simple and clear, grasps the main problems of the locality, and explains the relationship between the general election and solving these practical problems to the masses. For example, if there are bad elements in power locally, and the people are mainly afraid of not being able to elect out the bad elements, the propagandist should explain in detail the relevant provisions in the general election that protect the people's democratic rights from infringement and restriction, and the relevant provisions in the review of voter qualifications and the nomination of candidates, so that the people are convinced that their goal of electing out the bad elements can be achieved in the general election, and their enthusiasm will be improved. If the local people are eagerly demanding to build water conservancy, the propagandist should call on everyone to elect the person they think is most suitable to lead the construction of water conservancy in the general election, and everyone's enthusiasm will naturally be improved. When Shahe Township, Licheng County, Shandong, promoted the general election this time, it used facts familiar to the masses to illustrate the relationship between democracy and production, with very good results. Last year, when the township built irrigation ditches, the cadres had a bureaucratic work style, and the ditches were built but could not carry water, causing great losses to the masses; this year, when digging irrigation ditches, democracy was promoted, the dug ditches occupied less land and irrigated more land, and the masses were very satisfied. The propaganda of this case greatly increased the enthusiasm of the masses for implementing democracy and the general election. In this regard, many comrades who have done practical work in the past have not paid much attention. In this pilot grassroots election, we should strive to overcome this shortcoming and create experience in carrying out vivid propaganda in conjunction with the needs of the masses.
    In short, in this typical pilot project, we must create and promote the experience of running elections well in combination with production, in order to have a practical and effective typical demonstration effect on the entire grassroots election. In order for the experience of the pilot election to be mastered and promoted by the majority of grassroots cadres, the working group must pay attention to: first, before the work begins, explain to the local cadres the content of the election work, the general purpose, and the purpose of the work in each stage, explain the policy boundaries and working methods, and then let the local cadres discuss and formulate specific work plans and steps by themselves, and proceed step by step. The working group only provides conscientious guidance and help, and tries to prevent monopolization and substitution. Second, in the process of work, point out the good and bad, correct and wrong practices of the local cadres at any time, so that they can correct deviations and errors in time, and understand the reasons behind them. Third, when each stage of work is completed, help the local cadres to recall their own work process, recall the problems encountered and the process of solving them, study various successful and failed experiences, draw out the knowledge of the laws of work, and make plans for the next step of work. In summary, we must let local cadres use their own brains, come up with their own ideas, think of their own ways, and be responsible for their own work. Only in this way can the experience of the pilot project have realistic significance.
