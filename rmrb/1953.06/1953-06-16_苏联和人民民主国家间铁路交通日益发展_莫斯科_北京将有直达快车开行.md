    Railway Transportation Between the Soviet Union and People's Democracies is Developing Rapidly
    Direct Express Train Service Between Moscow and Beijing to be Opened
    [Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 15th] According to a report in "Labor Daily" on the 13th, railway transportation between the Soviet Union and People's Democracies is developing rapidly. Now, one can travel directly by train from Moscow to Czechoslovakia, Romania, the Mongolian People's Republic, and Bulgaria. Previously, passengers had to change trains at border stations. Now, throughout the entire journey from Moscow to Ulaanbaatar, Sofia, Prague, or Bucharest, they do not have to leave their comfortable, all-metal carriages at border stations.
    Direct international train service between Moscow and Budapest will begin on June 16th. In the near future, there will also be a direct express train between Moscow and Beijing, with the entire journey taking nine days.
