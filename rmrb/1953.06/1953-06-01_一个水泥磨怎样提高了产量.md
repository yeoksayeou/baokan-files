    How a Cement Mill Increased Production
    Shao Yu
    The cement mill at the Hangzhou Cement Plant—a machine that had always been unruly—has now been conquered and is completely obedient. It is constantly increasing its output according to people's will. Originally, it produced 14.7 tons per day, but now it has increased to 20 tons, 25 tons, and even 40 tons per day. Factory Director Kuang said, "Now we can confidently say that the potential of the cement mill has not been fully tapped. However, just four months ago, we were strongly advocating for adding more equipment!" It is not easy to be able to say these words. This is the result of advanced thinking overcoming conservative thinking, and the bureaucratic work style transforming into a work style of delving into reality and studying production.
    Since the Hangzhou Cement Plant started operation in March of last year, one thing has been a headache: the efficiency of the cement mill was low, while the efficiency of the kiln was high, creating an imbalance in production and resulting in a backlog of semi-finished products. At that time, the daily output of the cement mill was 14.7 tons, while the daily output of the kiln was 28 tons. This meant that nearly 14 tons of clinker would be accumulated every day. As time went on, the clinker piled up like a mountain, and the situation of capital backlog became increasingly serious.
    In May, the plant overhauled the cement mill. But the problem was still not resolved. After June, accidents became more and more frequent, and the mill often had to be shut down for repairs. In October, an even more serious accident occurred—the cement mill's ground shaft broke.
    The Municipal Bureau of Industry called to ask, "What is the reason for the accident? Have you found it?" Factory Director Kuang replied, "We don't have a clue yet, we are still studying it." At this time, Factory Director Kuang was extremely annoyed. He lowered his head and couldn't speak. He thought, "Mobilizing the workers to repair it is not a very difficult thing, but what about the future?" Factory Director Kuang used to work in the countryside and was a layman when it came to industrial production. However, he had been in the factory for more than a year, and he was still clueless about production. Whenever he encountered a critical moment, he couldn't come up with any ideas. He had been entangled in the cement mill problem for several months.
    Where was the problem?
    The problem was that Factory Director Kuang had not delved into production. Even after this serious accident occurred, he had not conducted in-depth investigation and research, but only listened to the one-sided opinions of a few technically conservative personnel. They said that the cement mill, designed according to British and American technical standards, had a maximum daily output of 20 tons, and the actual output during the Kuomintang rule never exceeded 20 tons. Now, by increasing the weight of the steel balls and other methods, the daily output had been increased to 28 tons, which greatly exceeded the machine's load-bearing capacity, so accidents were inevitable.
    People who are clueless are easily captured by conservative thinking. At that time, Factory Director Kuang felt that it would be good enough to ensure that the cement mill did not have accidents, and there was no talk of improving the efficiency of the cement mill. Therefore, he believed that the only way to solve the problem of semi-finished product backlog was to request the higher authorities to add more equipment.
    Soon, a report requesting the addition of a raw material mill was sent to the Municipal Bureau of Industry. At the same time, it was decided that the kiln for manufacturing semi-finished products would be temporarily suspended before the raw material mill was added.
    In January of this year, Factory Director Kuang returned from a meeting at the Municipal Bureau of Industry and couldn't sleep at night. He kept thinking about what the superiors had said to him at the meeting:
    "Judging from your performance in the meeting, it shows that you are still clueless about the production in the factory. It is not terrible if the production in the factory is not good for a while, but it is terrible if our leading cadres are confused about production... ." Yes, in the three-day meeting, he also realized that he had a big problem. For example, when the leaders asked him about the key production issues in the factory, he couldn't answer at all. Originally, he only knew in general that the key problem in the factory was the cement mill, but he didn't know the cause of the accidents in the cement mill. All this made him gradually realize where the problem was.
    At this time, Branch Secretary Wei Huaizhen, Engineer Yao, and veteran worker Qiu Sihai had already returned from their visit to the Northeast. This visit greatly encouraged them. As soon as Comrade Wei Huaizhen returned to the factory, he ran to the workshop. At this time, the cement mill had just experienced the accident of the broken ground shaft. The workers were all looking at Wei Huaizhen, and he resolutely said to the workers, "This time we must find a way to solve it!"
    Then, a meeting of the Party branch committee was held, and Wei Huaizhen and Factory Director Kuang each examined their past bureaucratic leadership in production. Factory Director Kuang said, "In the past, I was clueless about production, and I simply listened to what others said. I suffered as a result. Now I realize that when I am clueless about production, the most important thing is how to make myself knowledgeable, and I can't take shortcuts. Therefore, the only way is to go down and find out more about the situation... ." Finally, the branch committee meeting decided to convene a staff meeting to strengthen everyone's confidence in eliminating cement mill accidents and improving cement mill efficiency; leading cadres should change their style, go deep into the grassroots, rely on the masses, and find the key to solving the cement mill problem.
    In order to understand the situation of the cement mill, several leading cadres divided the work. Factory Director Kuang was assigned to the coppersmith workshop. One day, he went to find Master Qiu Sihai.
    Master Qiu Sihai has been working as a coppersmith for more than 30 years. In terms of practical experience, he is one of the best in the factory. He and Engineer Yao had already made some new discoveries about the cause of the cement mill accidents. When the cement mill had its first ground shaft breaking accident in October last year, there were different opinions inside and outside the factory. Some said it was because the motor speed was too fast, some said it was because the steel balls were too heavy, and there were many other opinions. Master Qiu believed that these were not the root cause of the problem. The root cause of the problem was in the gears. He found that the large and small gears were too thin, and the gears would jump when the machine was running. When the gears jumped, it would affect the ground shaft and the clutches. If the jumping was severe, accidents would occur. But at that time, Master Qiu was afraid that these ideas were just some "old ideas" and would not be useful if he brought them up, so he kept them in his heart. Now that Factory Director Kuang came to him, the tone of his speech was different from before. In the past, the factory director always said, "It's not like this, I can be sure." Now it was, "What do you think?" Master Qiu's thinking had changed after his trip to the Northeast, and coupled with the fact that the factory director personally came to him to discuss the problem, he told the factory director the ideas he had been keeping in his heart.
    Factory Director Kuang felt that this was very reasonable. He came back and carefully studied it with the engineer and found that if the gears did not jump, the ground shaft would not jump and would not break. Moreover, the steel balls could be increased; that is to say, on the basis of safety, the output could still be improved. He was extremely excited. After much research, he confirmed that the main reason for the cement mill accidents was the uneven pitch of the gears. Now the remaining question was how to solve it.
    The conversation with Master Qiu made Factory Director Kuang deeply realize the harm of his ignorance of production and his failure to rely on the masses. He thought, "If I had been able to go deep into the masses earlier and gather valuable opinions like Master Qiu's, wouldn't the cement mill problem have been solved earlier?" Now he was worried that he had no way to solve the problem of uneven gear pitch, so he did not hesitate to consult the workers and technicians.
    Factory Director Kuang went to Engineer Yao's home and happened to meet Master Qiu and several technicians from the factory there. Engineer Yao's work style had changed a lot since he returned from his visit to the Northeast. He was now working with the workers to study how to solve the gear problem of the cement mill. Everyone was happy to see the factory director come. The factory director, workers, and engineers gathered together to discuss. It was the first time that production problems were being studied in this way at the Hangzhou Cement Plant.
    Originally, there was a way to solve the problem of uneven gear pitch, which was to weld the thin gears to meet the standards, but this method would take too long and was not necessarily applicable.
    At this time, Engineer Yao brought up his previous suggestion of using cast iron gears to replace cast steel gears. Master Qiu then said, "I think this method will work. I used cast iron gears when I was repairing the Qiantang River Bridge in the past, but it would be more secure to add a little manganese iron."
    Everyone enthusiastically studied it. The engineers looked for scientific basis in books, and the workers looked for practical experience in their actual work. Finally, everyone agreed to use cast iron with manganese iron to make cast iron gears to replace cast steel gears. This would save ten days of time compared to using the welding method, and the cost would be half as much. Moreover, it would not be inferior to cast steel gears in use.
    This Spring Festival, the workers in the factory all took a vacation and went home, but the coppersmith workshop workers and technicians did not rest. They were working hard to eliminate the cement mill accidents. After five days of hard work, they replaced all the made cast iron gears as scheduled.
    After the Spring Festival, the cement mill started operating with a new look. There were no more accidents, and the output gradually increased, and the quality met the standards. A few days before the "May 1st" Labor Day, the workers in the cement mill workshop created an unprecedented record of 42 tons per day. All the workers in the factory cheered, and the factory director, section chiefs, and engineers rushed to the workshop to congratulate the people who created the new record.
    When Factory Director Kuang walked out of the jubilant workshop, he had already begun to consider the following question: "Now that the efficiency of the cement mill has greatly exceeded the efficiency of the kiln, we must now turn our attention to organizing balanced production."

    一个水泥磨怎样提高了产量
    韶羽
    杭州水泥厂的水泥磨——这部素来不驯顺的机器，现在已经被征服得服服贴贴了。它按照人们的意志，不断地提高着产量。原来日产十四点七吨，现在已经提高到日产二十吨、二十五吨，以至四十吨。该厂匡厂长说：“现在可以有把握地说：水泥磨的潜力还没有挖光。可是，在四个月以前，我们还竭力主张增加设备呢！”能够说出这几句话来，是不容易的。这是先进思想战胜了保守思想，官僚主义作风转变成为深入实际钻研生产的作风以后所得的结果。
    杭州水泥厂从去年三月开工以后，有一件事情伤透了脑筋：水泥磨效能低，大窑效能高，生产不平衡，造成半成品积压。当时水泥磨日产量是十四点七吨，而大窑的日产量是二十八吨。这样一天中就要有将近十四吨的熟料积压下来。日久天长，熟料堆积如山，资金积压的情况就越来越严重了。
    五月里，该厂把水泥磨检修了一下。但是问题还是没有解决。六月以后，事故反而越来越多，常常要停车修理。十月里有一天，竟发生了更严重的事故——水泥磨的地轴断了。
    市工业局打电话来问：“发生事故是什么原因，找出来没有？”匡厂长回答：“还没有头绪，正在研究。”这时匡厂长烦躁极了，他低下了头，讲不出话来。他想：“发动工人修理好它，这倒并不是一个很难的事情，可是以后怎么办呢？”匡厂长过去在农村工作，对工业生产是外行。不过，他进工厂已有一年多了，对生产仍是心中无数，一遇到紧要关头就拿不出主张。他已经被水泥磨问题纠缠了好几个月了。
    问题在哪里呢？
    问题就在于匡厂长没有钻到生产里去。就在这个严重的事故发生以后，他还没有进行深入的调查研究，只是片面听信少数有保守思想的技术人员的话。说什么根据英美技术标准设计的这部水泥磨，最高日产量是二十吨，在国民党统治时期的实际产量也没有超过二十吨。而现在用增加钢球重量和其他办法，把日产量提高到二十八吨，已大大地超过机器的承载能力，所以发生事故是不可避免的。
    心中无数的人，很容易变成保守思想的俘虏。那时匡厂长觉得能够保证水泥磨不发生事故就好，根本谈不上什么提高水泥磨的效能。因此，他认为解决半成品积压问题的唯一办法，便是请求上级给增加机器设备。
    不久，请求添置一部生料磨的报告送到了市工业局。与此同时，并决定在生料磨未添置前，制造半成品的大窑间暂时停止生产。
    今年一月匡厂长从市工业局开会回来，晚上怎么也睡不着觉。他反复想着上级在会上对他讲的话：
    “从你在会议中的表现来看，说明你对厂内生产还是心中无数的。厂里生产一时搞不好不足怕，但是我们领导干部对生产糊里糊涂，那就可怕了……。”是的，在三天会议中，他也发觉自己大有问题。比方说当领导上问他厂里的生产关键问题时，他怎样也答不出。原来他只笼统地知道厂里的关键问题是水泥磨，但水泥磨发生事故的原因是什么就不知道了。这一切使他逐渐意识到毛病出在什么地方了。
    这时支部书记魏怀珍和姚工程师、老工人邱四海已经从东北参观回来。这次参观对他们的鼓舞作用很大。魏怀珍同志一回到工厂就跑到车间，这时正好水泥磨发生了断地轴的事故，工人们都望着魏怀珍，而他就很坚决地向工人们说：“这次我们一定要想法解决它！”
    接着召开了党的支委会议，魏怀珍和匡厂长各自检查了过去领导生产的官僚主义。匡厂长说：“我过去对生产心中无数，单纯听人家说，人家说什么就是什么，结果吃亏了；现在我认识了对生产心中无数时，顶重要的是如何使自己心中有数，不能走捷径。因此唯一的办法就是多到下面去摸摸情况……。”最后支委会议决定：召开职工大会，坚定大家消灭水泥磨事故和提高水泥磨效能的信心；领导干部要改变作风，深入下层，依靠群众，寻找解决水泥磨问题的关键。
    为了摸清水泥磨的情况，几个领导干部分了工。匡厂长分工到铜匠间。有一天，他去找老师傅邱四海。
    邱四海老师傅做铜匠工作已有三十多年了，论实际经验，在厂里是数一数二的。他和姚工程师对水泥磨发生事故的原因早就有些新的发现。在去年十月水泥磨第一次发生断地轴的事故时，厂内厂外说法不一，有的说这是因为马达速度快，有的说这是钢球太重，还有许多各种各样的说法。邱师傅认为这些都不是毛病的总根，毛病的总根出在牙齿上。他发现大牙齿和小牙齿太薄，机器运转起来牙齿就跳动，牙齿一跳动，就影响地轴、克拉子跳动；跳动厉害了，事故便发生了。但是当时邱师傅怕这些想法又是些“老想法”，提出来不管用，所以便压在心里没有提。现在匡厂长来找他了，说话的语气也和以前不同了。过去厂长一说话总是：“不是这样，我可以肯定。”现在是：“你的看法怎样？”邱师傅这次去过东北后，思想有了转变，再加上厂长亲自来找他商量问题，于是就把他长久压在心里的想法照实告诉了厂长。
    匡厂长一听很有道理，回来就和工程师细细研究了一番，发觉如果牙齿不跳动，地轴就不会跳动，也不会断折；而且钢球还可以增加；也就是说，在安全的基础上，产量还可以提高。他兴奋极了。经过多方面的研究后，肯定了水泥磨发生事故的主要原因是牙齿节距不等，现在剩下的问题是如何想法解决了。
    和邱师傅的谈话，使匡厂长深刻体会到自己对生产无知和不依靠群众的危害性。他想：早能深入群众，把像邱师傅这样宝贵的意见集中起来，水泥磨问题不就早解决了吗？现在他又苦于没有办法解决牙齿节距不等的问题，于是毫不犹豫地去请教工人和技术人员。
    匡厂长走到姚工程师的家里，正巧遇到邱师傅和厂里几个技术人员也在那里。姚工程师自从到东北参观回来后，作风转变了不少，现在正和工人们研究解决水泥磨的牙齿问题。一看厂长来了，大家都高兴。厂长、工人、工程师团聚一起进行讨论。像这样地研究生产问题，在杭州水泥厂还是第一次。
    本来解决牙齿节距不等问题，有一个办法，就是用电焊把薄牙齿焊得合乎标准，但这个办法需要时间太长，而且也不一定适用。
    这时姚工程师把他以前曾考虑过的用生铁牙齿来代替铸钢牙齿的建议提出来。邱师傅接着说：“这个办法我看行得通，过去我在修钱塘江大桥时，就用过生铁的牙齿，不过再加上点鎷铁，就更保险。”
    大家热烈地研究起来。工程师们从书本上找科学根据，工人们从实际工作中找切身体验，最后大家一致同意用生铁加鎷铁做成生铁牙齿来代替铸钢的牙齿，这样比用电焊的方法节省时间十天，成本又便宜一半，而且使用起来并不次于铸钢牙齿。
    今年春节，厂里工人们都休假回家了，唯有铜匠间工人和技术人员没有休息。他们在为消灭水泥磨的事故而紧张地工作。经过五天的辛勤努力，如期把做好的生铁牙齿全部换上了。
    春节过后，水泥磨以新的姿态开始了运转，再没有发生事故，而且产量逐步上升，质量合乎标准。在“五一”劳动节的前几天，水泥磨间工人创造了日产四十二吨的空前纪录。全厂工人们都欢呼起来，厂长、课长、工程师纷纷奔往车间，向创造新纪录的人们祝贺。
    当匡厂长从欢腾的车间走出来时，他已开始考虑着这样一个问题：“现在水泥磨的效能已大大超过了大窑的效能，今后必须把精力转向组织均衡生产的问题上去。”
