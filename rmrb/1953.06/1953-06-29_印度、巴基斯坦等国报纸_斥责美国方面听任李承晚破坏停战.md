Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, June 28th: Newspapers in India and Pakistan have condemned the U.S. for allowing Syngman Rhee to sabotage the armistice, and demanded that the U.S. take swift and effective action against this provocative behavior.

	The "Today" newspaper published an editorial on the 22nd entitled "The Eyes of the World Are on America," stating: "Now, the Communist countries no longer need to present any further evidence to demonstrate their efforts for peace. It is now up to the United States to provide such evidence. If the Americans hope that Asia will believe in its sincerity and desire for peace, then it should stop its evil actions of inciting Syngman Rhee and Chiang Kai-shek, who have long been proven to be the greatest obstacles to peace in Korea." The "National Herald" published an editorial on the 25th stating: "If the armistice negotiations fail, so that the war in Korea cannot be ended, and Syngman Rhee's tactics achieve obvious success, then the responsibility will fall entirely on the United States and the United Nations Command." The editorial said, "Senator McCarthy and General Van Fleet, along with others, have openly praised South Korea's treacherous actions. But even apart from the praise of these people, Syngman Rhee can obtain sufficient reason from the moderate attitude of American officials to persist in his blatant disregard for the United Nations." The editorial said, "The Communist side has stated that all released prisoners of war must be returned to their prisoner-of-war camps... No one can say that the Communist side is wrong."

	The "Crossroads" weekly published an editorial on the 28th stating: "The U.S. government's pretense of ignorance cannot deceive anyone. Even children know that Syngman Rhee is merely an American puppet, and if he did not have the support of American arms and American troops, he would have long been driven out by the Korean people and thrown into the dustbin of history." The editorial said that the people of the world know that Syngman Rhee would not dare to release prisoners of war without the connivance of the U.S. government. The editorial said that it is strange that General Clark did not discuss the issue of recovering the "released" prisoners of war during his meeting with Syngman Rhee. This American general said that the U.S. proposal to conclude a "mutual defense treaty" with South Korea remains valid.

	The "Pakistan Times" published an editorial on the 26th stating: "Although Europe and Asia have unanimously and strongly condemned Syngman Rhee's unilateral act of sabotage, the U.S. response, to say the least, is unbelievable, merely expressing misfortune and regret over the incident."

	The "Dawn" newspaper published an editorial on the 23rd stating: "The foundation for achieving peace in Korea, painstakingly built over two years, has been destroyed. Only by taking firm and swift action can the United Nations extricate itself from the difficult situation caused by the actions of its spoiled puppet and salvage the situation in Korea. The desire for peace must be stronger and more powerful than the mad and foolish actions of this despised leader."

### 印度、巴基斯坦等国报纸  斥责美国方面听任李承晚破坏停战

    印度、巴基斯坦等国报纸
    斥责美国方面听任李承晚破坏停战
    据新华社新德里二十八日电：印度和巴基斯坦报纸斥责美方听任李承晚破坏停战，要求美方对这个挑衅行为迅速采取有效的行动。
    “今天报”二十二日以“全世界的眼光都注视着美国”为题发表社论说：“现在，共产党国家已经不需要再提出任何证据来表明他们的和平努力了。现在是应该由美国来提供这种证据的时候了。假使美国人希望亚洲相信它对建立和平的诚意与愿望，那么，它就应该停止它那种煽动李承晚与蒋介石的罪恶行动，李承晚和蒋介石早经证明是朝鲜和平的最大障碍。” “国民先驱报”二十五日发表社论说：“假使停战谈判失败，以致朝鲜的战争不能结束，而李承晚的策略却获得明显成功，那么，这个责任将完全落在美国与联合国军司令部的身上。”社论说，“参议员麦卡锡和范佛里特将军与其他一些人已公然赞美南朝鲜的背叛行动。但是，纵然除了这些人的赞美之外，李承晚也可以从美国官员们的温和态度中获得充分理由来坚持他那种公然蔑视联合国的态度。”社论说，“共方已经声明：必须使被释放的战俘全部回到他们的战俘营……任何人也不能说共方说的话不对。”
       “十字路”周报二十八日的社论说：“美国政府佯为不知的态度是骗不了任何人的。甚至小孩子们也知道李承晚只不过是一个美国傀儡而已，假如没有美国军火和美国军队的支持，他早已被朝鲜人民赶走，而被掷到历史的垃圾堆里去了。”社论说：全世界的人民都知道，假使没有美国政府的纵容，李承晚是不敢释放战俘的。社论说，令人奇怪的是，克拉克将军在与李承晚会谈时，竟没有谈到追回被“释放”的战俘的问题。这位美国将军却说，美国提出的与南朝鲜缔结“共同防御公约”的建议仍然有效。
    “巴基斯坦时报”二十六日发表社论说：“虽然欧洲和亚洲一致强烈地斥责李承晚的片面破坏行动，但是美国的反应说来真不能使人相信，它仅仅表示对这个事件感到不幸与遗憾。”
    “黎明报”二十三日发表社论说：“在两年期间辛辛苦苦地建立起来的实现朝鲜和平的基础已经被破坏了。只有采取坚定而迅速的行动，才能使联合国摆脱由于被它纵容坏了的傀儡的行动所造成的困难局面，从而挽回朝鲜的局势。要求和平的愿望必须比这个被人唾弃的领袖的疯狂愚蠢的行为更加强硬有力。”
