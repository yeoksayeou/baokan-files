Answer to Reader Question: How to Identify Pyrite and Marcasite

    Editor's Note: Since the launch of the mass ore reporting movement, this newspaper and the Central Geological Department have received many ore reporting letters and various kinds of ores from the people, among which pyrite and marcasite are the most numerous. Now we are publishing the Q&A on how to identify pyrite and marcasite below, so that everyone can more correctly identify these two minerals.

    Question: How to identify pyrite and marcasite?

    Answer: Pyrite ore does not look like iron, but is similar to copper and gold; one type of pyrite ore is especially similar to gold, hence the name "fool's gold." Pyrite ore is very brittle, and breaks when struck with a hammer or hard stone; while gold has great ductility, becoming longer and flatter with hammering. Pyrite ore is harder than copper; it cannot be scratched with copper or a knife; but when copper is scratched with a knife or pyrite ore, a groove appears immediately. Pyrite ore is lighter in color than copper ore (of course, copper ore comes in colors other than yellow). When pyrite is scratched on a porcelain plate, it leaves a brown streak. When placed on a charcoal fire, it has a sulfurous smell. These are the ways it differs from copper or gold. The most common shape of pyrite is cubic, like a dice, with stripes on each face like the surface of bamboo. These cubes sometimes cluster together into lumps, with small sand-like grains attached to the outside. Some surfaces are smooth and shiny, like gold. Some look like a bundle of scattered straw.

    Marcasite is similar to pyrite; their properties and composition are the same, only marcasite is slightly lighter in color than pyrite, and the shape is somewhat different.

    Mountains containing pyrite and marcasite often have a strange phenomenon – the ground there often seems to have rising hot air, which can be seen from a distance. In winter, when it snows, the snow there melts faster.

    Pyrite and marcasite belong to non-metallic minerals. It is also called iron sulfide, the main component of which is sulfur, followed by iron; generally containing 53.4 percent sulfur and 46.6 percent iron. Although it contains a lot of iron, the excessive sulfur content affects iron smelting. However, it is the main raw material for sulfur extraction, which can be used to make sulfuric acid, ferrous sulfate, and the remaining red powder can also be used as pigment for painting walls, which is very useful in the chemical industry and military industry.

    怎样识别黄铁矿和白铁矿
    编者按：自从展开群众报矿运动以来，本报和中央地质部收到许多人民群众寄来的报矿信和各种各样的矿石，其中尤以黄铁矿和白铁矿为最多。现在我们把怎样识别黄铁矿和白铁矿的答读者问发表于后，以便大家更正确地识别这两种矿。问：怎样识别黄铁矿和白铁矿？答：黄铁矿矿石并不像铁，却和铜、金差不多；有一种黄铁矿矿石尤其和金相像，因此也叫“愚人金”。黄铁矿矿石很脆，用铁锤或硬石一敲就破碎了；而金的延展性很大，越锤越长越扁。黄铁矿矿石比铜硬，用铜或小刀去刻它都刻不动；但是用小刀或黄铁矿矿石去刻铜，一刻就出现一条槽。黄铁矿矿石比铜矿的颜色要淡（当然铜矿除了黄色的还有其他颜色的）。把黄铁矿在瓷板上划一下，即有一条褐色的痕迹。把它放在木炭火上烧，有一股硫黄味。这些是它和铜或金的区别的地方。黄铁矿的外形最常见的是立方形，像一颗骰子，每一面还像竹子外表那样有一道道的条纹。这种立方体有时集聚在一起变成块状，外面附有像泥沙那样的小粒。有的表面滑而光，像金子一样。有的好像一束稻草散开来一样。
    白铁矿和黄铁矿差不多，它们的性质成分都是一样，只是白铁矿比黄铁矿颜色稍淡，形状有点不同罢了。
    藏有黄、白铁矿的山，常有一种很奇怪的现象——那里的地面常常好像有升腾的热气似的，远远地就可以看出来。冬天下雪，那里的雪也融化得快一些。
    黄铁矿和白铁矿是属于非金属矿物。它又叫硫化铁，主要成分是硫，其次才是铁；一般含硫百分之五十三点四，含铁百分之四十六点六。它虽然含铁不少，但是由于含硫太多，影响了铁的冶炼。但它是炼硫的主要原料，可以制硫酸、绿矾，剩下的红粉还可以作刷墙壁的颜料，在化学工业和军事工业上都很有用。
