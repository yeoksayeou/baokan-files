Cultural Briefs:

The China Youth Art Theater began performing the five-act play "Forty Years of Wishes" in Beijing on May 25th. By June 23rd, it had been performed 23 times for an audience of 50,000. The play left a deep impression on the broad worker audience. Some workers, after returning to their factories, held discussions and talks, deeply realizing that under the leadership of the Party, the working class can overcome any difficulty. They expressed their intention to integrate the education and inspiration they received into actual production, striving to realize the wishes of the people of the whole country.

In order to expand the impact of the play and to meet the demands of construction workers, the China Youth Art Theater decided to undertake a short tour. All the staff of the play left Beijing on June 24th for Guanting Reservoir to perform for those actively participating in the construction of this great project.

    中国青年艺术剧院去官厅水库演出话剧“四十年的愿望”
    中国青年艺术剧院于五月二十五日起在北京上演五幕话剧“四十年的愿望”，至六月二十三日止曾先后公演二十三场，观众五万人。这个戏在广大工人观众中留下深刻的印象。有些工人回到工厂后进行了漫谈和讨论，他们深深体会到工人阶级在党的领导下，没有克服不了的困难；并表示要把受到的教育和启发贯串到生产实际中去，为实现全国人民的愿望而奋斗。
    中国青年艺术剧院为了扩大这个戏的演出效果，并满足基本建设工人的要求，决定作短期旅行公演。该剧全体工作人员已于六月二十四日离京，赴官厅水库为积极参加建设这一伟大工程的人们演出。
