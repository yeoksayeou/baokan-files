Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 10th: Japan recently published a new book, "Japan's Chastity." This book collects firsthand accounts written by many Japanese women who were raped by the US occupation forces, accusing the US occupation forces of lewd and shameless atrocities in Japan. Due to the Japanese people's widespread hatred of the US occupation forces, this book has become a bestseller in Japan. Progressive Japanese filmmakers are preparing to turn the facts in this book into a film.

The editor of "Japan's Chastity," Mizuno Hiroshi, once worked as a translator for the US military at a certain US military base in Japan. He personally witnessed the shameless atrocities of American troops wantonly ravaging Japanese women. Filled with national indignation, he risked danger to collect many tearful accusations from Japanese women who had been deprived of their chastity by the US occupation forces, and compiled a portion of them into this book as the most powerful accusation against the atrocities of the US occupation forces.

Mizuno Hiroshi said in the postscript: "American officers and soldiers, whenever and wherever they get the idea, rape women without any consideration. This is something everyone who works on American bases knows." "If she resists, she will be killed. Even if she shouts, no one dares to help. If someone dares to help, that person could be sentenced to ten to fifteen years of hard labor."

Mizuno Hiroshi pointed out that such atrocities by the US occupation forces are not limited to soldiers; senior officers and so-called military police who maintain military discipline are even more shameless. "The only difference between the behavior of the military police and the soldiers is that they wear the name of military police. They use their privileges, and their behavior is often more barbaric."

    日本出版“日本的贞操”一书
    控诉美国占领军暴行
    【新华社十日讯】东京消息：日本在不久之前出版了一本新书——“日本的贞操”。这本书收集了许多日本妇女亲自写的她们被美国占领军蹂躏的实录，控诉了美国占领军在日本的荒淫无耻的暴行，由于日本人民普遍痛恨美国占领军，这本书目前已成为日本最畅销的一本书。日本进步电影工作者并准备将这本书中的事实拍成电影。
    “日本的贞操”的编者水野浩，曾在美国在日本的某军事基地担任过美军的通译员。他曾目睹美军任意蹂躏日本妇女的无耻兽行，激于民族义愤，他冒着危险收集了许多被美国占领军夺去了贞操的日本妇女的血泪的控诉记录，并将其中一部分编成了这本书，作为对美国占领军兽行的最有力的控诉。
    水野浩在编后记中说：“美国军官和大兵，不论在什么时候和什么地方，只要一起念头，就毫不在意地强奸妇女。这是在美国基地上工作的人谁都知道的。”“如果反抗的话，她就会被杀死。即使叫喊，也没有人敢来帮助。要是有人敢来帮助，这个人就可能被判处十年到十五年苦役。”
    水野浩指出，美国占领军这类的暴行并不限于兵士，高级军官和所谓维持军纪的宪兵甚至更加无耻。“宪兵的行为和兵士的唯一不同点就是他们挂上宪兵的名义。他们利用自己的特权，行为常常更野蛮。”
