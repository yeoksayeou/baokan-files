    "For Lasting Peace, For People's Democracy!"
    Introduction to the Chinese Edition of Issue 22, 1953

    The Chinese edition of Issue 22, 1953, of the Cominform organ "For Lasting Peace, For People's Democracy!" has been published.

    To welcome the World Women's Congress, this issue published an editorial entitled "Women Are a Great Force in the Struggle for Peace" and the article by Mrs. Vaillant-Couturier, Secretary-General of the Women's International Democratic Federation, describing the preparations of women from all over the world for the World Women's Congress - "On the Eve of the World Women's Congress." The editorial stated: This World Women's Congress is the most extensive and representative gathering in the history of the women's movement, and its purpose is to unite all women to seek correct ways to solve the problems that are of pressing concern to them on the basis of free exchange of opinions. The agenda of the congress and its lofty goals have aroused the most sincere and widespread response in various countries. More and more women have realized that lasting and solid peace is a prerequisite for the victory of their struggle for a better life and a happy future for their children. In the Soviet Union, China, and other people's democracies, in Western Europe and the Americas, and in Asia, Africa, and Australia, women everywhere are resolutely demanding an end to the barbaric wars of slaughter against the Korean, Vietnamese, and Malayan peoples, and demanding the conclusion of a Five-Power Peace Pact. The International Democratic Women's Movement has become increasingly integrated with the great common struggle of the people of all countries for peace. The editorial then made a strong comparison between the happy lives of women in socialist countries and the tragic lives of women in imperialist countries with vivid examples. The editorial pointed out: This congress is an important stage in the struggle of the people of all countries for peace. It will help to promote the women's movement extensively. For women in capitalist countries, colonies, and dependencies, this congress is an excellent platform where they can appeal against the cruel exploitation and inhuman oppression they suffer. The editorial concluded by saying that Communist and Workers' parties have the obligation and responsibility to attract wider masses of working women to participate in political and social life, to participate in the peace movement, and to give them all support and guidance.

    This issue publishes the full text of the "Pravda" editorial of May 24 in Moscow entitled "On the Current International Situation."

    This issue publishes a lengthy summary of the important speech "On the Socialist Transformation of Agriculture in the Romanian People's Republic" delivered by Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Romanian Workers' Party, on May 23 at the Congress of Advanced Workers of Collective Farms in the Romanian People's Republic. This speech discussed the development of socialist components in Romanian agriculture since 1949 and pointed out the prospects for agricultural construction in Romania. Combining the development of collective agriculture in Romania, Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej explained that the voluntary principle is the guarantee for the consolidation and prosperity of collective farms, and pointed out the importance of patiently explaining to individual farmers. He emphasized that farmers need time to experience and truly believe in the superiority of the collective economy. Farmers will not be satisfied with words, no matter how beautiful they sound. They need factual proof. And we have plenty of proof, which must become known to all working farmers. At the same time, Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej also pointed out that it is necessary to oppose the tendency of passive waiting and laissez-faire in organizing the collective economy.

    Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej explained some of the basic principles of the new statute of collective farms in Romania, put forward the important task of Romania increasing agricultural production to meet the raw material needs of industry and the growing food needs of the working people, and pointed out several important tasks that must be carried out to fulfill this task.

    This issue also carries news of active preparations in various parts of China for the elections of people's congresses at all levels.
