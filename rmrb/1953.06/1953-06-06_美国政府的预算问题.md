    The U.S. Government's Budget Problems
    By Bi Wuyiernaer, Soviet Union
    On April 30th, President Eisenhower said at a press conference that he intended to ask Congress to cut $8.5 billion from the 1953-1954 budget. He said that the main savings would come from reducing military spending and foreign aid.
    In the post-war period, especially since the Korean War, the huge U.S. national budget has been almost entirely devoted to military purposes. Civilian expenditures in the federal budget do not exceed one-tenth of the total, and the remaining nine-tenths are directly or indirectly supplied to the war machine. Even some bourgeois economists estimate that one-third of the current national income is spent on military expenses. Government spending has been increasing rapidly since 1948, which, as people know, was already a very high level. In the current fiscal year (the year from July 1, 1952, to June 30, 1953), total budget expenditures are nearly $75 billion, more than 8.5 times the expenditures in 1939, and equal to the level of 1942-1943 during World War II. The budget drafted by the Truman administration for the next year (1953-1954) is even larger, at $78.6 billion.
    The extravagant U.S. government spends huge sums of money on expanding its army, increasing equipment, and supplying its armed forces, which has led to a temporary increase in demand. This situation has correspondingly led to price increases and temporary activity in industrial production. In 1952, as a result of the upward spiral of monopoly prices and the storage of speculative and strategic materials, the wholesale price index increased by 12.5 percent compared to 1949, and by 62 percent compared to 1945. The high price of weapons of destruction, as vividly described by Eisenhower in his speech to the American Society of Newspaper Editors on April 16th, is not only due to the large amount of raw materials and human labor consumed in their manufacture, but also to the government's generosity to the capitalists whose monopoly profits have risen to unprecedented levels. In the eighteen months after the outbreak of the Korean War, the stock prices of military industries rose by 77 percent, while the stock prices of other general enterprises rose by only an average of 18.5 percent.
    The high price of military equipment, as a result of the insatiable greed of the monopoly capitalists who have strong influence in the government's military departments, is one of the factors in the deterioration of the U.S. financial situation. Due to continuous price increases, the government's military departments have had to overpay large industrial enterprises with huge sums of money at the expense of taxpayers. The American banker Bernard Baruch recently said that due to rising prices, the government spent an extra $12 billion for military supplies from the Korean War to mid-1952, and will spend an extra $10 billion in the current fiscal year.
    At a conference discussing inflation in May 1951, union representatives said that inflation was the result of monopoly capitalists manipulating behind the scenes. The figures cited at the conference showed that in the year ending March 31, 1951, Americans had overpaid more than $15 billion to the "masterminds of inflation."
    Therefore, the arms expansion movement and the increasing military expenditures have produced another evil consequence—a general rise in prices. These two factors develop in the same direction and combine to worsen the national financial situation, increase taxes, cause inflation, and devalue the dollar.
    During World War II, despite price controls, there was still a considerable degree of dollar devaluation and inflation, and the trend has been towards increasingly serious inflation ever since. Although the government has repeatedly increased taxes, it has still been unable to meet the needs of expenditures. Budget deficits are made up by issuing public debt. As a result, the government's total debt increased from $46 billion in 1939 to $270 billion in 1946.
    In the United States, as in other capitalist countries, the government's large-scale issuance of public debt inevitably leads to further inflation and price increases. Public debt has never found buyers among the masses of the people, so the government distributes it to large banks, which benefit greatly through some complex financial procedures (such as buy-and-sell deposit calculations). However, the result cannot but be an increase in the amount of payment instruments in circulation and the creation of new inflation.
    The huge increase in U.S. government debt, combined with the devaluation of the dollar, poses a real danger to the government's credit and is fraught with the threat of national bankruptcy amid serious economic instability. After World War I, this threat was avoided by reducing debt, i.e., repaying part of the government public debt. However, the arms expansion movement after the end of World War II, especially the Korean War, has completely lost the possibility of partially improving the financial situation by reducing government debt (which was $259 billion at the end of 1952). The annual interest payment on government debt is nearly $6 billion.
    Because the increasing issuance of public debt is bound to put the government's credit institutions in serious danger, the government decided to balance the budget by increasing taxes. Federal tax revenue in 1939 was only $5.5 billion, but by 1952 it had increased to $68.7 billion. The average tax burden per American (including local taxes) increased from $106 to $514.
    Taxes have become a heavy burden on the working class. Indirect taxes are added to the prices of consumer goods, which of course will further increase prices. Repeated increases in personal income tax have severely hit people with meager incomes. The minimum income tax exemption was $2,000 in 1939, while it was $600 in 1951. During the same period, the number of income tax payers increased from 4 million to 44.3 million. Current official statistics also acknowledge that direct and indirect taxes account for one-third of the income of American working families. The high tax burden also falls on American farmers, government officials, freelancers, and lower-income middle classes.
    But on the other hand, the business taxes paid by companies closely colluding with government departments are of course very small compared to the profits they earn from military orders. However, not all sectors of the big bourgeoisie are like this, so some of their spokesmen are already complaining about high taxes. It should be pointed out that in last year's presidential campaign, the Republican leaders' favorite trick was to attack Truman's tax policies and promise to reduce taxes.
    Until recently, most American bourgeois economists, and official proponents of optimism, still believed that high taxes would weaken inflation and would become a source of revenue that could stabilize currency. Facts have forcefully refuted this argument. High taxes have proven to be only a dam against the surging inflation, which will continue to worsen even if no new public debt is issued. The price hikes mentioned above are not only due to the increasing needs of the arms expansion movement, but also due to the continued devaluation of the dollar and the evil consequences of inflation.
    If American finance wants to have a truly solid foundation, it can only be achieved by "reducing" the currency that has greatly inflated during the war, and only by "withdrawing from circulation" the excessive currency. However, the U.S. government has not tightened the currency (as long as the huge military expenditures exist, it will be impossible to tighten the currency). As a result, inflation has continued to develop due to the accelerated increase in the amount of paper money in circulation and credit lending, the increasing amount of consumer lending, and the reduction of goods related to the amount of currency.
    Charles Wilson, a prominent figure in the American war economy, compared the serious threat of inflation in 1951 to "Public Enemy Number One." President Eisenhower also said on the eve of the election, "All the strength of our new government should be devoted to the war against inflation."
    It is understandable that the U.S. government is suffering from inflation. In 1951, the dollar was only worth 43 percent of its value in 1939. Leaving aside other considerations, this alone greatly damaged the government's credit and trust in the Treasury's ability to pay. The devaluation of the dollar has also lowered the value of various government public debts. For example, public debt purchased in 1939, plus accumulated interest, has now lost 27 percent of its value.
    The fact that government public debt has depreciated explains why the government is hesitant to issue new public debt. Facts have proven that at current prices, it is extremely difficult not only to sell public debt, but also to maintain public debt. Moreover, it has been necessary to repeatedly use pressure to prevent demands for large-scale repayment of the depreciated government public debt. The large amount of government public debt and the damage to government credit will inevitably bring the threat of a complete financial collapse. In order to avoid financial collapse, the government has been forced to repeatedly resort to increasing taxes, using it as a source of national and local revenue.
    Even with these abnormal measures, the budget still cannot be balanced. Government debt increased by nearly $4 billion in 1951-1952, and will increase by nearly $6 billion in the current fiscal year.
    American newspapers also point out that as long as there is still a deficit in the budget and as long as government debt continues to increase, those nice-sounding promises to reduce taxes will only be promises. But from the current income situation in the originally drafted 1953-1954 budget, there is no possibility of reducing taxes, and it is not even possible to eliminate the deficit.
    So, what would be the possible consequences of Eisenhower's suggestion to cut budget expenditures?
    Even if this suggestion is accepted by Congress, expenditures in 1953-1954 will still exceed $70 billion. Moreover, a smaller budget allocation for a specific project does not necessarily mean that expenditures will be smaller. When Congress approves expenditures, it only gives the government the power, not the obligation, to use a certain item. In recent years, Congress's appropriations have often not been used up, and there is still room for the government to spend on future activities under the deferred settlement items (i.e., funds that have been approved for use but have not been used).
    Adding these deferred settlement funds, the government still has the right to use funds of $153 billion in the current fiscal year, which is almost twice the expenditures listed in the budget. In fact, expenditures will be $85 billion, which means that the deferred settlement funds for the next fiscal year will be nearly $70 billion, and the government may spend much more than provided for in the budget.
    The U.S. policy of "extending" the war preparation plan exposes the lie that the increasing military expenditures, as stated by those American leaders, are due to "external threats." The fact is very clear that if there really were such a threat, the U.S. government would not "extend" its military plan, but would complete it in the shortest possible time.
    The real reason for "extending" the war preparation plan is that the Korean War and the arms expansion movement are being used as the main method of artificially stimulating business activity. The "extended" war preparation plan is determined by the profits of some large monopoly capitalists, who cannot digest all the huge and profitable war orders at once within the originally specified time, and they also decided not to let these orders slip out of their hands.
    Because the government can spend more than the budget allows, and more than it asks Congress for, it is very doubtful that there will be a large reduction in military expenditures or the prevention of further increases in military expenditures in the next fiscal year.
    In any case, regardless of the size of the federal budget for the next year, this suggestion to cut expenditures undoubtedly reflects the unfavorable situation of U.S. national finance and monetary circulation.
    The increasing difficulties in U.S. finance caused by the arms expansion movement have had serious consequences. First, the devaluation of the dollar and the increasing taxes are the main factors in the sharp decline in real wages. The widespread strike movement shows the increasingly fierce resistance and dissatisfaction of the masses. Second, the weakening of American finance will undoubtedly and has already produced international repercussions, because this situation is making the dollar's position in the capitalist world market even weaker.
    Further examination of the background makes it clear that the planned methods do not seem to be effective. The painful experience of recent years has convinced most Americans that it is impossible to stabilize the national financial situation without a decisive reduction in the items of national income spent on military expenses. The current planning for revising the budget does not show any possibility of cuts, and even if some cuts can be made in certain items, the entire budget is still a war budget.
    It is significant that the Eisenhower administration submitted to Congress a "cut" in the so-called foreign aid appropriations, reducing Truman's original hope of $7.6 billion to $5.828 billion, and suggested that the majority of this money be used for military purposes. Of the $5.828 billion, $5.25 billion was requested to purchase weapons to aid foreign countries, and only the remaining $550 million was used for so-called technical and economic assistance. The so-called foreign aid appropriations include $100 million for carrying out sabotage and subversion activities in democratic countries.
    Newspapers reported that the U.S. government's excuse for submitting these appropriations to Congress was that "the Soviet Union" has not yet provided "proof of a real desire for peace." This argument is naturally untenable, because the Soviet Union's peace policy is a well-known fact. But the U.S. budget does not provide any proof of a willingness to shift to a peaceful economy.

    美国政府的预算问题
    苏联  比乌日纳尔
    四月三十日，艾森豪威尔总统在记者招待会上说，他打算要求国会把一九五三—一九五四年度预算的开支削减八十五亿美元。他说，减少军费和对外援助，将是节省的主要部分。
    战后时期，特别是自朝鲜战争以来，美国巨大的国家预算几乎全部是为军事目的服务的。联邦预算中的民政支出不超过总数的十分之一，另外的十分之九直接或间接地都供应了战争机器。甚至一些资产阶级经济学者的推算也认为目前国民收入的三分之一都耗于军费。政府的支出自一九四八年以来即不断地迅速增加，人们知道，一九四八年已经是很高的水平了。在本财政年度（指一九五二年七月一日至一九五三年六月三十日为止的一年），全部预算的支出近七百五十亿美元，超过一九三九年的支出约八点五倍，等于第二次世界大战时期一九四二—一九四三年度的水平。杜鲁门政府草拟的来年度（一九五三—一九五四年度）的预算，数字更大，为七百八十六亿美元。
    挥霍的美国政府消耗大量金钱于扩充军队、增加装备和供应武装部队上，因而引起了暂时的需求的增加。这种情势也相应地引起了物价上涨，工业生产的暂时的活跃。一九五二年，由于垄断价格螺旋上升以及投机的和战略的物资存储的结果，批发价格指数比一九四九年提高了百分之十二点五，比一九四五年提高了百分之六十二。杀人武器价格高昂，艾森豪威尔在四月十六日向美国报纸编辑协会演说时曾极生动地加以描述过，这种高昂不仅应归因于制造这些武器时所耗费的大量原料和人的劳力，而且也应归因于政府对垄断利润空前高涨的资本家们的慷慨大度。朝鲜战争爆发后的十八个月中，军事工业的股票上涨了百分之七十七，而其他一般企业的股票不过平均上涨了百分之十八点五。
    军火价格的高昂，在政府军事部门中有强力影响的垄断资本家们贪得无厌的结果，乃是美国财政情况恶化的因素之一。由于物价不断提高，政府的军事部门不得不用牺牲纳税人的手段以巨款超额偿付大工业企业。美国的银行家贝尔纳德·巴鲁克最近曾说，由于物价上升，自朝鲜战争起至一九五二年年中，政府为了军事供应曾多花了一百二十亿美元，而在本财政年度内还要多花一百亿美元。
    在一九五一年五月讨论通货膨胀的一次会议上，工会代表曾说过，通货膨胀是由于垄断资本家在幕后操纵的结果。这次会议所引证的数字说明，到一九五一年三月三十一日为止的一年中，美国人曾超额偿付给“通货膨胀的幕后人”一百五十亿美元以上。
    所以，扩张军备运动和日增的军事支出已经产生了另一个恶果——物价普遍高涨。这两个因素向相同方向发展，互相结合起来，使国家财政情况恶化，赋税增加，通货膨胀，美元贬值。
    在第二次世界大战时期，虽然有物价管制，仍有相当程度的美元贬值和通货膨胀，此后的趋向是通货膨胀日益严重。政府虽然一再增加赋税，仍不能适应支出的需要，预算的赤字靠发行公债来弥补，结果是政府的全部债务在一九三九年是四百六十亿美元，而在一九四六年则增至二千七百亿美元。
    在美国，也正如在其他资本主义国家一样，政府大规模发行公债不可避免地要引起进一步的通货膨胀和物价上涨。公债向来在人民群众中找不到买主，政府就把它们分配到大银行里去，藉助于一些复杂的金融上的手续（例如，买空卖空的存款计算），使大银行得到很大利益，然而结果不能不是支付工具流通量的增加和引起新的通货膨胀。
    美国政府债务的巨大增加，和美元贬值结合在一起，对于政府的信用是一个真正的危险，并且充满了在严重的经济不稳中使国家破产的威胁。第一次世界大战后，这一威胁由于减少债务即偿还一部分政府公债而避免了。然而第二次世界大战结束后的扩张军备运动，特别是进行朝鲜战争，已经完全失去了使用减少政府债务（一九五二年年底为二千五百九十亿美元）以部分地改善财政情势的可能性。每年偿付政府债务的利息差不多已达六十亿美元。
    由于增发公债必然要使政府的信用机构发生严重危险，政府决定以增加赋税来平衡预算。一九三九年的联邦税收不过五十五亿美元，到一九五二年已增加到六百八十七亿美元。平均每一个美国人的纳税额（包括地方税在内）从一百零六美元增加到五百一十四美元。
    赋税已成为劳动阶级的重负。间接的赋税是增加在消费物品的价格上的，当然要使物价进一步上涨。个人所得税的一再增加，严重地打击了收入微薄的人们。所得税的免税最低额在一九三九年为二千美元，而在一九五一年则为六百美元，在同一时期内，所得税纳税人的数目由四百万增加到四千四百三十万。目前官方的统计也承认，直接和间接的赋税已占去了美国工人家庭收入的三分之一。高额赋税的打击也同样地落到美国农民、政府官员、自由职业者和收入较低的中等阶层的身上。
    但在另一方面，和政府各部门密切勾结的公司所缴纳的营业税，和它们因军事订货而赚得的利润相比，当然还是很少的。然而并不是大资产阶级的各个行业都是如此，所以它们之中的一些代言人已经在抱怨高额赋税了。应当指出，在去年的总统竞选中，共和党领袖们拿手的好戏就是攻击杜鲁门的赋税政策和许诺减低赋税。
    直至最近，多数美国资产阶级经济学者，和官方的乐观主义鼓吹者，还认为高额赋税会减弱通货膨胀，并且会成为一种能够稳定通货的财源。事实已经有力地驳斥了这种论断。高额赋税证明只是一道阻挡汹涌的通货膨胀的堤防，而通货膨胀是在即使不发行新公债的情况下也是要继续恶化下去的。上面提到的物价高涨，不仅由于扩张军备运动日增的需要，也由于美元继续贬值和通货膨胀的恶果。
    美国财政如果想有一个真正坚实的基础，只有“减少”在战争中大大膨胀了的通货，只有“从流通中收回”过多的通货。不过，美国政府没有紧缩通货（只要庞大的军事开支存在一天，紧缩通货就一天办不到），结果，由于纸币流通量及信用借贷加速度的增加和日渐增多的消费者的借贷及和通货数量有关的商品的缩减，通货膨胀继续发展了。
    美国战争经济机构中数得着的角色查尔斯·威尔逊，一九五一年时曾把通货膨胀的严重威胁比作“第一号内部敌人”。艾森豪威尔总统，在竞选的前夕也曾说过，“我们新政府的全部力量应投之于反对通货膨胀的战争中”。
    美国政府为通货膨胀所苦是可以理解的。一九五一年美元只相当于它在一九三九年价值的百分之四十三。丢开其他不谈，只这一点就大大地损伤了政府的信用和对于国库支付能力的信任。美元贬值也将政府的各种公债的价值压低了，例如，一九三九年买得的公债加上累积的利息，现在已损失了百分之二十七的价值。
    政府公债贬值这一事实又说明政府对发行新公债踌躇不前的理由。事实证明，在目前的价格上，不但销售公债，就是要保持公债，也是极为困难的事情。并且，不得不一再使用压力阻止大规模偿还贬值了的政府公债的要求。大量的政府公债和政府信用受到的损伤，必然会带来整个财政崩溃的威胁。为了避免财政崩溃，政府被迫一再求助于增加赋税，利用它作为国家和地方的财源。
    即使用了这些反常的手段，预算依然不能平衡，一九五一—一九五二年度政府债务增加了近四十亿美元，本财政年度还要增加近六十亿美元。
    美国报纸也指出，只要预算中仍有赤字，只要政府债务继续增加，那些动听的减少赋税的许诺也只能是许诺而已。但是从目前的在原来拟订的一九五三—一九五四年度预算中的收入情况看来，根本谈不到减低赋税，甚至也不可能消除赤字。
    那么，艾森豪威尔建议削减预算支出的可能的结果又会如何呢？
    即使这一建议为国会接受，一九五三—一九五四年度的支出仍然要超过七百亿美元。并且，预算对某一特定项目拨款较小，并不就意味着开支也必然较小。国会在同意开支时，只是给政府以权力而不是义务，来动用某一款项。最近几年来时常是国会拨款并没有用尽，在延期决算项目（即获准动用而未曾动用的款项）下仍有政府为将来支出活动的余地。
    加上这些延期决算的款项，在本财政年度内政府尚有权动用款项一千五百三十亿美元，差不多相当于列在预算中支出的两倍。事实上，开支将是八百五十亿美元，这就是说，下一财政年度的延期决算款项将近七百亿美元，政府可能开支得比预算中提供的要多得多。
    美国“延长”备战计划的政策把那些美国领袖们所说的军事支出日增系由于“外来威胁”的谎言戳穿了。事实非常清楚，假使真有这种威胁的话，美国政府就不会使它的军事计划“延长”了，而会在最短的可能的时间内来完成它。
    “延长”备战计划的真正原因是：朝鲜战争和扩张军备运动是被当作人为的刺激企业活动的主要方法的。“延长”备战计划是由一些大垄断资本家的利润所决定的，它们不能一下子在原来规定的时间内消化完所有庞大而有利的战争定货，而且它们也决定不让这些定货溜出它们的手心。
    因为政府能够开支的比预算允许的为多，也比它向国会所要求的为多，所以，在下一个财政年度中大量削减军事支出或防止军事支出进一步的增加，是很可怀疑的。
    无论如何，不管下年度联邦预算数目大小如何，这种削减支出的建议无疑反映出美国国家财政和货币流通的不利情况。
    因扩张军备运动引起的美国财政日增的困难，已经产生了严重的结果。第一，美元贬值和赋税日增是实际工资急剧下降的主要因素，广泛的罢工运动显示出群众的越来越激烈的抵抗和不满。第二，美国财政上的削弱无疑将要并且已经产生了国际性的反响，因为这种情势正使得美元在资本主义世界市场上的地位更加削弱。
    进而考察事情的背景就可以明白，筹划中的办法看来也不是什么有效的。最近几年来的痛苦经历使得美国大多数人相信，如果不对国民收入中耗于军费的项目作决定性的缩减，要想稳定国家财政情势是不可能的。目前修订预算的一些策划看不出有什么削减的可能，而且即使能对若干项目作一些削减，整个预算也仍然是一个战争预算。
    意义深长的是艾森豪威尔政府向国会提出“削减”所谓援外拨款，将杜鲁门原来希望的七十六亿美元减为五十八亿二千八百万美元，建议将这一批钱的大部分用作军事目的。在五十八亿二千八百万美元中要求以五十二亿五千万美元购买武器援助外国，剩下的五亿五千万美元才用作所谓技术和经济援助。在所谓援外拨款中，包括在民主国家进行破坏颠覆活动的一亿美元。
    报纸报道说，美国政府所以向国会提出这批拨款的藉口是据说“苏联方面”还没有“真正的和平愿望的证明”。这种论据自然是丝毫站不住脚的，因为苏联和平政策是众所周知的事实。而美国的预算，却没有提供任何愿意转向和平经济的证明。
