	Dream Realized
	Ma Haichun
	In the past, I was a telephone soldier in the Kuomintang reactionary army. The telephone was truly a wonderful thing. Hundreds of miles apart, you could crank it, and the bell would ring. You could pick up the receiver and talk without seeing the person. I found it very strange and always dreamed of understanding what exactly was going on inside the telephone. But in the reactionary army, this remained just a dream.
	The work I did was either climbing poles or connecting wires. When there was nothing to do, we drilled all day long. I was never told how the telephone was constructed. Once, I couldn’t hold back anymore and went to ask the company commander, "Report, company commander, can you tell us how the telephone is constructed?" Several other soldiers around also said, "Give us a lesson, everyone wants to learn." The company commander squinted his eyes and said with a fake smile, "What schools did you all graduate from?" Everyone looked at each other, speechless. The company commander continued, "You can't even read three 'sheng' worth of big characters, yet you want to learn this and that. Explaining it to you is like casting pearls before swine!" Everyone was angry and hateful, and no one said anything more, and they all ran away.
	One day, we were suddenly gathered for a lesson, saying that the signal officer would talk about "electricity." I was very happy, thinking that even if I couldn't learn it, it would be good to hear a few words. I saw the signal officer walking in with several thick books. He talked for a long time, saying things we had never heard before, like "atoms" and "electrons." I listened attentively, but I still didn't understand. After the lesson, the company commander asked me, "What is an electron?" I had to say, "I don't understand." He raised his eyebrows and scolded:
	"Dumb bug!"
	When the signal officer repaired the telephone, he would chase people out, close the door, and repair it, never letting anyone watch. Once, I went to guard a machine more than ten miles from the city, and suddenly it couldn't communicate. I thought to myself: the officers aren't here, so I'll take it apart and tinker with it. This disassembly was serious; not only could I not talk, but the bell didn't ring either. I had no choice but to pack it up and carry it back to the city for repair. When I got to the city, the company commander found out that I had disassembled the telephone and glared at me, saying angrily, "You are so bold, disassembling the machine at will. If you do this again, I'll beat your ass!"
	In August 1947, the cannons roared, and the machine guns rattled. Two days later, we were liberated. When I got to the revolutionary troops, I was still a telephone soldier, but it was very different from the telephone soldier I was before. This was a telephone soldier serving the people.
	In a few days, I was in technical class. Although I was liberated, the old ideas were not easily overturned. At that time, I thought to myself: I haven't studied, and no one is willing to teach me sincerely, so that's just how it is. Unexpectedly, the lecture was really different from before! The instructor first drew a diagram and then disassembled the machine, explaining the structure, function, and how to repair it when it malfunctioned, piece by piece. After the lecture, we practiced dismantling and assembling, and also organized discussions.
	Once, I asked the master mechanic, "What school did you graduate from, Comrade Master Mechanic?" He smiled and replied, "Graduated from the sorghum field university." "Then where did you learn the technology?" The master mechanic said, "As long as you are willing to study hard, as long as you are determined, under the leadership of the Party, there is nothing you can't learn." He paused and then said, "It's not enough to just rely on classes, you have to practice more in actual work. If you don't understand, it's okay to ask me." In this way, I felt bright in my heart. In the reactionary army, if the officers had a little bit of technology, it was their capital to fool the soldiers, afraid that you would learn it; in the revolutionary army, they were afraid that you would not learn it.
	Once, when I was hanging up a line machine, the machine malfunctioned. Although I had learned it, I wanted to take it apart and repair it, but I was a little afraid. I thought to myself: it would be good if it was repaired, but if something went wrong, wouldn't I be in trouble. I carried the machine home to find the master mechanic. The master mechanic looked at it and asked, "What's wrong? Have you checked it?" I said, "No, I'm afraid I'll break it." The master mechanic said, "What are you afraid of? If you never get married, you'll still be a spinster when you're old. In the future, you must be careful and bold, and you can master the technology by practicing in actual work."
	Under the cultivation of the Party, with the help of comrades, and through the practice of actual work, the dream of the past has become a reality. I have learned the technology to serve the people in the revolutionary army and have become a telephone mechanic.

    梦想实现了
    马海春
    过去我在国民党反动军队中当的是电话兵。电话，真是个稀奇玩艺儿，相隔几百里路，一摇，铃就叮叮地响起来，拿起听筒，看不见人就能讲话。我觉得真奇怪，始终做着个梦，想明白电话里面到底是什么名堂。可是在反动军队中这始终还是个梦。
    我干的活，不是爬杆子，就是结线头。没有事就整天出操。电话到底怎样构造的，一次也没给我讲过，有一回：我实在憋不住了，就跑去问连长：“报告连长，你给咱们讲讲电话机怎么构造的好吗？”周围有几个当兵的也都说：“给我们上堂课吧，大家都想学学。”那连长眯着眼，皮笑肉不笑地说：“你们都是什么学校毕业的？”大家一听，大眼瞪小眼没话可说。连长接着说：“斗大的字认不得三升，还想学这学那的，给你们讲还不是对牛弹琴！”大家听了，心里又气又恨，谁也没再开腔，一个个都跑开了。
    有一天，突然集合上课，说是机佐讲“电学”。我挺高兴，心想学不会听几句也是好的。只见机佐拿着几大本厚厚的书走进来，他讲了半天，讲的话咱从来没听到过，什么“原子”“电子”，我聚精会神地听，也听不懂。上完课，连长问我：“什么是电子？”我只好说：“不懂。”他眉毛一竖骂道：
    “笨虫！”
    机佐平时修理电话机，要把人赶出去，关上门修理，看也不叫人看。有一次，我到离城十多里的地方去守机子，忽然不能通话了。我心想：当官的不在，卸开来捣估捣估。这一卸不要紧，不但话讲不通，连铃也不响啦。只好收拾起来背回城里去修。到了城里，连长知道了我拆过电话机，眼一瞪，怒气冲冲地说：“你好大胆，随便拆卸机器。下次再这样，打烂你的屁股！”
    一九四七年八月，炮声隆隆，机枪哒哒，两天后，我们被解放了。到革命部队，我还当电话兵，可和以前的电话兵大大不同，这是为人民服务的电话兵。
    没有几天，就上了技术课。虽说解放了，旧观念还一下打不倒。当时我心想：一没读过书，二也没人肯真心教，反正就是这么回事。不料，讲课一开始，就真跟从前不同啦！教员先画了图，又把机器卸开，一件一件地讲构造、作用和发生故障时怎样修理。讲完以后，又练习拆装，还组织讨论。
    有一次，我问机师：“机师同志是什么学校毕业的？”他笑着回答：“高粱地大学毕业。”“那你在哪里学的技术呢？”机师说：“只要肯钻研，只要有决心，在党的领导下，没有学不会的事。”他停了停接着又说：“光靠上课还不行，要在实际工作中多锻炼，不懂问我好了。”这样，我心里亮堂起来了，反动军队里当官的有了点技术，就是他糊弄士兵的本钱，就怕你学会了；革命部队里，就怕你学不会。
    有一次我挂路机，机子发生了故障，我虽然学过，想卸开修一下，但又有点怕。我心里想：修好了倒好，出了毛病还不是找难看。背着机子回家找机师，机师一看倒先问：“什么毛病，你检查过吗？”我说：“没有，我怕弄坏了。”机师说：“怕什么？一辈子不出嫁，到老还是个大姑娘。以后要细心大胆，在实际工作中锻炼，才能掌握技术。”
    在党的培养下，经过同志们的帮助，和实际工作的锻炼，过去的梦，已经成了事实。我在革命部队里学到了为人民服务的技术，并且成了一个电话机师。
