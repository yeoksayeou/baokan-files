Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, June 14th: The "People's Daily" published an editorial on the 12th, titled "A Great Force Fighting for Peace," commenting on the World Women's Congress that closed on the 11th.

The editorial first emphasized that the convening of the World Women's Congress is of particular importance at a time when people of all countries are full of new hope in striving for a peaceful settlement of international disputes. The editorial said: The international women's movement is a great force. In the past few years, the political activities of women around the world have intensified, the international connections of women's organizations in various countries have become increasingly consolidated, and the international women's movement is expanding. The World Women's Congress clearly demonstrates that the international women's movement is becoming more organized and larger in scale. The Congress expressed its approval of the activities of the Women's International Democratic Federation, the largest mass organization of women in the world. The purpose of these activities is to protect the rights of women and children and to defend world peace.

The significance of the Congress lies first in the fact that, after discussing the most pressing issues in the hearts of every woman and every mother, the Congress unanimously resolved the main issues in the current women's movement. The Congress marks a new stage in the international women's movement. The editorial continued: The Congress adopted the "Declaration of Women's Rights," which will undoubtedly become a concrete program of action for women's organizations in their struggle for women's democratic rights. The Congress formulated the principle of uniting women regardless of political views, religious beliefs, and nationality, thereby giving strength to many women's organizations to determine their direction and consolidating their confidence that they will ultimately achieve final victory for the just cause that meets the vital interests and aspirations of women around the world. The editorial pointed out that the participation of women representatives from the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and the People's Democratic countries in the Congress is a new contribution to strengthening mutual understanding and cooperation among the people of all countries. Soviet women are builders of a happy new society with full rights, they happily contribute their diverse talents to constructive peaceful labor, they stand at the forefront of peace fighters, and their example inspires millions of women around the world.

The editorial said: The reports and speeches at the Congress proved with new force that women in many countries are still in an unequal position today, and even in a completely disenfranchised position. The basic women's rights won by the long and tenacious struggle of working people for generations are now being trampled on by the ruling groups of many countries. In colonial and semi-colonial countries, women are subjected to double discrimination: on the one hand, because they are women, and on the other hand, because their skin color is different from that of the colonizers. In countries where the ruling groups are pursuing a policy of expanding armaments, the lives of women are now even more difficult; their situation is getting worse day by day. Increased taxes, reduced hospitals, nurseries, and maternity hospitals, the closure of factories engaged in peaceful production, and rising prices – the full burden of these sufferings falls on the shoulders of working families, on the shoulders of women and mothers. Women in countries that are expanding armaments are increasingly aware that their constant struggle to defend their rights, to protect mothers and children, is inextricably linked to the struggle for peace.

The editorial said: The Congress unanimously advocated stopping the Korean War, peacefully resolving the issues of Germany, Austria, and Japan, and stopping the wars in Vietnam and Malaya. The Congress demanded that negotiations be held between the five major powers to conclude a peace treaty, implement international cooperation, and prohibit the manufacture and use of any weapons of mass destruction of humanity. The Congress called on women to fight more resolutely for the settlement of international problems through consultation, to oppose colonial exploitation and foreign rule, and to strive for the right of people to determine their own destiny. The Congress, representing millions of women, paid tribute to the peace fighters who were imprisoned for defending peace and national independence, and called on all women's organizations to strengthen their struggle to secure their immediate release.

The editorial concluded: The convening of the World Women's Congress and the circumstances of all its meetings vividly demonstrate the great power of the lofty ideals of international friendship and cooperation. The World Women's Congress called on women around the world to cooperate closely and carry out organized and resolute struggles to fight for their rights as mothers, workers, and citizens. There is no doubt that millions of women will respond to the resolutions of the Congress, will set off a new upsurge in the women's movement, and will strengthen the inseparable link between the women's movement and the powerful democratic movement for peace and international security.

    苏联“真理报”发表社论
    评世界妇女大会的伟大意义
    【新华社十四日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：“真理报”在十二日以“为和平而奋斗的伟大力量”为题发表社论，评论十一日闭幕的世界妇女大会。
    社论首先强调指出，在世界各国人民满怀新的希望争取和平解决国际争端的时候，世界妇女大会的召开有着特别重要的意义。社论说：国际妇女运动是一种伟大的力量。在过去几年中，世界各地妇女的政治活动加紧起来了，各国妇女组织的国际联系日益巩固，国际妇女运动正在扩大中。世界妇女大会清楚地证明：国际妇女运动越来越有组织、规模越来越广泛了。大会对于世界妇女最大规模的群众组织——国际民主妇女联合会的活动表示赞同。这些活动的目的，在于保卫妇女和儿童的权利，保卫世界和平。
    大会的意义首先在于：大会在讨论了每个妇女和每个母亲心中最迫切的问题后，一致解决了目前妇女运动中的主要问题。大会标志着国际妇女运动的新阶段。社论接着说：大会通过了“妇女权利宣言”，这个宣言无疑地将成为妇女组织在争取妇女民主权利斗争中的具体行动纲领。大会制订了不分政治见解、宗教信仰和民族团结妇女的原则，从而给予许多妇女组织以决定方针的力量，巩固了它们对符合世界妇女的切身利益和愿望的正义事业必定会获得最后胜利的信心。社论指出：苏联、中华人民共和国、人民民主国家的妇女代表的参加大会，是对加强各国人民之间的互相谅解和合作的新贡献。苏联妇女是有充分权利的幸福的新社会的建设者，她们把自己多方面的才能愉快地贡献给建设性的和平劳动，她们站在和平战士的前列，她们的榜样鼓舞着全世界千百万妇女。
    社论说：大会上的报告和发言以新的力量证明，许多国家的妇女直到今天仍然处于不平等的地位，甚至处于完全没有权利的地位。劳动人民世世代代进行长期顽强的斗争赢得的起码的妇女权利，现在也给许多国家的统治集团蹂躏了。在殖民地和半殖民地国家，妇女们受到双重的歧视：一方面因为她们是妇女，另一方面因为她们的肤色和殖民者的肤色不同。在那些统治集团执行着扩充军备政策的国家里，妇女的生活现在更加困难；她们的处境一天不如一天。赋税增加，医院、托儿所、产科医院减少，从事和平生产的工厂关闭，物价不断上涨，这些苦难的全部负担都压在劳动者家庭的肩上，都压在妇女和母亲们的肩上。扩充军备的国家的妇女们，越来越明白她们为保卫自己的权利、保卫母亲和孩子的经常斗争，和争取和平的斗争有着不可分割的联系。
    社论说：大会一致主张停止朝鲜战争、和平解决德国、奥地利和日本的问题，停止越南和马来亚的战争。大会要求：五大国间进行谈判以缔结和平公约，实行国际合作，禁止制造和使用任何大规模屠杀人类的武器。大会号召妇女更坚决地为争取通过协商解决国际问题而斗争，号召妇女反对殖民剥削和外国统治，争取人民决定自己命运的权利。大会代表千百万妇女向为捍卫和平和民族独立被囚禁的和平战士致敬，并号召所有的妇女团体加强斗争，争取立刻释放他们。
    社论最后说：世界妇女大会的召开及其全部会议情况，生动地证明了国际友好和合作的崇高理想所具有的伟大力量。世界妇女大会号召全世界的妇女紧密地合作，为争取她们作为母亲、工人和公民的权利进行有组织的坚决斗争。毫无疑问，千百万妇女将响应大会的决议，将在妇女运动中掀起新的高潮，将加强妇女运动与争取和平、国际安全的强大的民主运动的不可分的联系。
