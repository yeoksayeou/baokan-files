    Anshan Iron and Steel Small Rolling Mill Mobilizes Workers to Rectify Original Record Work
    [Our Dispatch] The Anshan Iron and Steel Company's small rolling mill is mobilizing workers to rectify original records. In the past, the main drawback of the small rolling mill's original records was that they could not accurately reflect the actual production situation of each process. For example, the output records of the rolling shift always did not match the production figures of the heating furnace and finishing shifts; waste products caused by processes such as the light rolling north side enclosure and shearing were not recorded; and the records of cut head iron sheets were estimated. Therefore, many workers reflected: "Shearing is not recorded, heating furnace is estimated, rolling is recorded haphazardly." Such chaotic original records created great difficulties for planning and management work.
    The small rolling mill decided to conscientiously rectify the original records during this discussion of the national production plan. Initially, only statistics and record personnel were mobilized to participate in this work, and grassroots cadres were not organized to study relevant documents and instructions on rectifying original records to raise their ideological awareness. Therefore, the erroneous ideas of those who did not pay attention to original records were not criticized. When statistical personnel went to various work sections to inspect problems in the original record work, the work section cadres and workers not only did not provide assistance, but said: "We are engaged in production, and the rectification of original record work has nothing to do with us."
    The leadership of the small rolling mill promptly summarized this lesson, mobilized the masses, and reversed the tendency to rectify original record work in isolation. First, it organized grassroots cadres, technicians, and staff to study various documents related to the rectification of original records, and conscientiously examined and corrected past erroneous understanding of original record work. Some grassroots cadres reviewed and said: "In the past, I always opposed record personnel, thinking that they were supervising us and specifically looking for our faults." Some said: "In the past, in order to make our shift look good, we deliberately muddled the record personnel." The leadership also reviewed the shortcomings of not paying attention to the original record work in the past and frequently transferring record personnel. The record personnel also examined their thoughts of being unwilling to work and irresponsible phenomena.
    After the cadres studied, they formed several groups, went deep into the workshops, and educated the workers and inspected problems in the original record work. Each group explained the importance of original records to the workers, dispelled the workers' concerns that the original records were for increasing quotas, and used specific facts to illustrate the harm of incorrect original record work, so that the workers consciously participated in the rectification of original record work. For example, the heating shift of the second work section lacked correct records. In February, when rolling 19 mm round steel, 120 kg of steel was used, but the record stated that 140 kg of steel was used, resulting in a loss of more than 90 tons of finished products for the finishing shift; this not only failed to complete the task, but also affected the workers' wage income. From this, the workers realized the importance of original record work and came to check the problems in the original record work. According to the problems found, the main problems were that the allocation of record personnel was inappropriate, and there were no recorders in places where records should be kept; no responsibility system was established for the work of record personnel; record personnel did not understand the production and operation situation, and often made omissions and errors in records. In addition, part-time recorders were busy with production and could not record in time, often making the records "memoirs".
    Based on these situations, the leadership has formulated specific measures to establish a responsibility system and a reward system. After being educated, the grassroots cadres and workers all said that they would unite with the record personnel in the future to do a good job in the original record work so that the original records can accurately reflect the production situation.

    鞍钢小型轧钢厂发动职工整顿原始记录工作
    【本报讯】鞍山钢铁公司小型轧钢厂正在发动职工群众整顿原始记录。过去小型轧钢厂原始记录的主要缺点，就是不能正确地反映各工序的实际生产情况。如压延班产量的记录，总是和加热炉、精整班的生产数字不相符合；光轧北面围盘、剪断等工序所造成的废品都没有记录；切头铁皮的记录是估计的。因此，很多工人反映：“剪断不记，加热炉估计，压延乱记。”这样混乱的原始记录，便给计划管理工作造成很大困难。
    小型轧钢厂决定在这次讨论国家生产计划中认真地整顿原始记录。开始，只发动统计、记录等人员参加这一工作，没有组织基层干部学习有关整顿原始记录的文件与指示，提高他们的思想认识，因此，那些不重视原始记录的错误思想也没有受到批判。统计人员到各工段检查原始记录工作中的问题时，工段干部和工友们不但不给予帮助，反而说：“咱们是搞生产的，整顿原始记录工作与我们无关。”
    小型轧钢厂领导方面及时地总结了这一经验教训，发动群众，扭转孤立进行整顿原始记录工作的偏向，首先组织基层干部、技术人员、职员学习有关整顿原始记录的各种文件，认真检查并纠正过去对原始记录工作的错误认识。有的基层干部检讨说：“我过去总是和记录人员闹对立，认为他们是在监督我们的，专门找我们的毛病。”有的说：“过去为了本班好，故意矇混记录人员。”领导方面也检讨了过去不重视原始记录工作，经常调动记录人员的缺点。记录人员也检查了不安心工作的思想和不负责任的现象。
    干部学习后，又组成几个小组，深入车间，向工人进行教育和检查原始记录工作中的问题。各个小组向工人说明原始记录的重要性，解除了工人中认为原始记录是为了提高定额的顾虑，并用具体事实说明原始记录工作不正确的害处，使工人自觉地参加整顿原始记录工作。如第二工段加热班由于缺乏正确的记录，在二月份轧十九粍圆钢，用一百二十公斤的钢料，但记录上记的是用一百四十公斤的钢料，使精整班的成品亏了九十多吨；这不仅完不成任务，而且影响了工人工资收入。工人们从这里认识到原始记录工作的重要性，于是都来检查原始记录工作中的问题。根据检查出来的问题来看，主要是记录人员的配备不适当，应当记录的地方没有记录员；对于记录人员的工作没有订立责任制度；记录人员不了解生产与操作情况，经常发生漏记、误记的现象。另外，兼职记录员忙于生产，不能及时记录，往往使记录成为“回忆录”。
    领导方面根据这些情况，已制订出具体办法，建立责任制度与奖励制度。基层干部和工人们经过教育后，也都表示：今后一定和记录人员团结起来，做好原始记录工作，使原始记录能正确地反映生产情况。
