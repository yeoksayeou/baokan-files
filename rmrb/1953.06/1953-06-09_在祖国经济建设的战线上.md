    On the Economic Construction Front of the Motherland
    Shijiazhuang is Being Built into an Industrial City
    Shijiazhuang is gradually being built from a consumer city into an industrial city. Three years ago, the land on both sides of the Shijiazhuang-Zhengding highway was still a green expanse of wheat fields; now, a brand-new industrial zone has emerged. To the northwest of the state-owned Shijiazhuang No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory, which began construction on May 1st this year, are six large and medium-sized factories, including textile and flour mills, built in the past three years. In the original urban area, the Shijiazhuang Coking Plant, Power Plant, and Daxing Textile Factory, which were destroyed by the enemy and puppets, have also been completely restored, with production exceeding pre-war levels. Nine large and medium-sized factories newly built in the original urban area have also started production. Over the past three years, the city's industrial population has increased threefold. The Shijiazhuang municipal construction projects serving the industry have also developed rapidly. (Xinhua News Agency report)
    Survey Team Begins Measurement Work on the Upper Reaches of the Yellow River
    The survey team of the Lanzhou Hydroelectric Survey Office has begun measurement work on the upper reaches of the Yellow River. This survey team is jointly composed of more than 240 people from the survey team of the Survey and Design General Team of the Hydroelectric Power Construction General Bureau of the Ministry of Fuel Industry and the survey team of the Lanzhou Hydroelectric Power Engineering Preparation Office.
    This year's measurement work on the upper reaches of the Yellow River extends from Longyang Gorge in Qinghai to Heishan Gorge in Ningxia, a total length of 900 kilometers. In this area, the Yellow River flows through towering mountains and ridges, forming many gorges along the riverbanks. The water flow is very rapid, with waves reaching more than ten feet high in some places, making it impossible for ordinary ships to navigate. The specific work of the survey team in these areas is to establish triangulation networks, measure control points, draw topographic maps, and understand the general situation of the Yellow River, in order to prepare data for the future construction of hydroelectric power stations. (Xinhua News Agency report) The Dagushan Kilometer Drilling Rig Exceeds Its Task
    The Dagushan Drilling Team of the Anshan Iron and Steel Geology Department failed to complete its task in the first quarter, and the core recovery rate was low. After the launch of the responsibility system campaign, the drilling team members of the kilometer drilling rig held continuous meetings in mid-April to study the reasons for the failure to complete the task and the low quality. After improving the drilling method, the machine drilled 45.83 meters in early May, with a core recovery rate of 93.4%, exceeding the task.
    The drilling team members of the kilometer drilling rig made the following improvements to the drilling method: 1. The abrasive was added every 500 millimeters instead of every 700 millimeters of drilling progress. This changed the past phenomenon of fewer abrasives remaining after drilling 700 millimeters, weaker crushing force, and easy formation of conical cores. 2. The Soviet expert's suggestion of "frequent lifting and sampling" was conscientiously implemented, and core samples were taken every one to two meters of progress. When lifting the drill string after drilling more than one meter, 0.5 kg of river sand and 1.5 kg of abrasives were added; when lifting after drilling two meters deep, 1 kg of river sand and 2 kg of abrasives were added to ensure core sampling. 3. Bentonite was used instead of yellow mud slurry, and 30% sodium chloride was added when using it. Bentonite has high viscosity, small particles, is easy to stir and uniform, has a sand content of 1%, and good colloidal and permeability properties. This lubricated the drilling tools, floated out the rock powder, cooled the drill bit, and provided good wall protection, effectively preventing the collapse and chipping of the well wall. 4. The nozzle of the drill bit was changed from 150 millimeters long to 120 millimeters, and the nozzle width was changed from 102 millimeters to 81 millimeters. As a result, the drainage volume was reduced from 70 kg to 30 kg, saving more than half of the water consumption. (Anshan Steel)
    Hemp Cardboard Boxes Can Replace Wooden Boxes for Packaging Goods
    Hemp cardboard boxes for loading goods, after a long-distance transportation test, have proven to be inexpensive and durable and are currently being vigorously promoted.
    The transportation test was conducted by the Shanghai Procurement and Supply Station of the China Department Store Company, which loaded twenty-three kinds of goods, including batteries, light bulbs, harmonicas, sneakers, carbon paper, and diaries, and transported them from Shanghai to Beijing, Tianjin, and Weixian County, Shandong. The inspection results showed that all the loaded goods were undamaged after reaching their destinations. During the experiment, employees of the procurement and supply wholesale stations in Beijing and Tianjin also put forward some suggestions for improvement, making the new hemp cardboard boxes more perfect.
    The Ministry of Commerce of the Central People's Government has instructed the Shanghai Procurement and Supply Station of the China Department Store Company to start using new hemp cardboard boxes under the policy of "improving while using." (Xinhua News Agency report)
    People's Liberation Army Tibetan Regiment Engages in Agricultural Production
    The armed forces of the Tibetan people on the Kangzang Plateau – the Tibetan Regiment of the Chinese People's Liberation Army – is intensely engaged in agricultural production. A certain company, which had won the title of "Construction Pioneer," formed a production team of more than 60 soldiers and launched a red flag competition, planting wheat and highland barley on time. The whole regiment has now completed the spring sowing of more than 1,300 mu of land. This land was reclaimed by them last year. The wheat, highland barley, and other crops planted last year were all bountiful. These sons and daughters of the Tibetan people have adopted advanced farming methods from the Han areas in production, setting a good example for Tibetan farmers to develop production. Many Tibetan farmers rode horses from dozens of miles away to visit the use of horse-drawn plows and learn planting and fertilizing techniques. Commanders and fighters of the Tibetan Regiment patiently taught them advanced farming techniques and gave them some agricultural tools and crop varieties that had never been planted on the Kangzang Plateau. During the busy farming season, the Tibetan Regiment also enthusiastically helped local farmers plow the land, irrigate, and harvest crops. (Xinhua News Agency)
    Flood Control Project on the Daying River Being Built in Baoshan District, Yunnan
    The flood control project on the Daying River, which runs through Lianghe, Yingjiang, and Lianshan counties in Baoshan Prefecture, Yunnan Province, was completed at the end of May. The Daying River valley is where the Dai people live. In the past, whenever floods occurred, nearby villages and fields were often submerged. Last year, the Yingjiang County People's Government led the local people to repair dikes and dams, reducing the disaster. In early April this year, the Baoshan Prefectural Administrative Office established the Daying River Flood Control Engineering Committee, allocated a large amount of food and material costs, and built a large-scale flood control project. This project used a total of about 49,000 workdays, repaired and newly built more than 13,000 meters of river dikes, benefiting more than 67,000 mu of farmland, and is estimated to increase rice production by 3 million jin.
    During the project, the local Dai people automatically participated in the construction, and farmers of other ethnic groups nearby also supported the construction of this project. The Han people of Tengchong County contributed more than 1,000 workdays to assist in the construction of the Laoshaba dike on the Lianghe River; the Shantou, Lisu, and other peoples in the Yingjiang mountainous area also transported bamboo racks and wood and participated in the dike construction.

    A Wool Textile Factory is Being Built in Ningxia
    A local state-owned wool textile factory is being built in Ningxia Province. The factory building project began construction in May last year and is expected to be completed by the end of this year.
    Most areas of Ningxia Province are pastoral areas, and the output of wool has gradually increased since liberation. After this factory starts operation, the wool exported from Ningxia Province can be washed and shipped out here. Calculated on the basis of 50 jin of clean wool produced from 100 jin of raw wool, washing can save half of the transportation costs. This factory will also produce an appropriate amount of blankets and woolens to meet the needs of the people of all ethnic groups in Ningxia. (Xinhua News Agency)

    在祖国经济建设的战线上
    石家庄市正建设成为工业城市
    石家庄市正由一个消费城市逐步建设成为工业城市。三年前，沿石（家庄）正（定）公路两侧还是一片碧绿的麦地；现在，一个崭新的工业区出现了。今年五月一日兴工的国营石家庄第一棉纺织厂的西北两侧，是近三年来新建成的纺织、面粉等六座大、中型工厂。原市区内，被敌伪破坏了的石家庄炼焦厂、发电厂、大兴纺织厂也早已完全恢复，生产量超过了战前水平。新建在原市区的九座大、中型工厂也已开始生产。三年多来，全市的工业人口已经增加了两倍。服务于工业的石家庄市政建设工程也飞速发展起来。（据新华社讯）
    测量队开始黄河上游的测量工作
    兰州水力勘测处测量队已开始黄河上游的测量工作。这个测量队由中央人民政府燃料工业部水力发电建设总局勘测总队测量队和兰州水力发电工程筹备处测量队二百四十多人联合组成。
    今年黄河上游的测量工作是从青海龙羊峡到宁夏黑山峡，全长九百公里。这一带，黄河在崇山峻岭中流过，构成沿河两岸的许多山峡，水流非常湍急，有几处激起的水浪达一丈多高，一般船只无法航行。测量队在这些地区的具体工作是打三角网，测控制点，画地形图，并了解黄河一般情况，为将来兴建水电站准备资料。（据新华社讯）大孤山千米钻机超额完成任务
    鞍钢地质处大孤山钻探队第一季度没有完成任务，岩心回采率低。开展责任制运动后，千米钻机的钻探队员在四月中旬连续开会研究了为什么完不成任务和质量低的原因。在对钻探方法进行了改进后，该机五月上旬已钻进四五点八三公尺，岩心回采率达百分之九三点四，超额完成了任务。
    千米钻机的钻探队员对钻探方法作了如下的改进：一、把进尺七百粍时投给钻粒改为在进尺五百粍时投给钻粒。这就改变了过去钻进七百粍时钻粒剩得少，克取力弱，岩心易成锥形体的现象。二、认真执行了苏联专家“勤提勤采”的建议，每进一—二公尺采取岩心一次。在钻进一公尺以上提引时投入河砂零点五公斤、钻粒一点五公斤；在两公尺深提引时投入河砂一公斤，钻粒二公斤，保证了岩心的采取。三、用澎润土代替黄泥浆，在使用时加百分之三十的氯化钠。澎润土粘性大颗粒小，易搅拌且均匀，含砂量百分之一，胶体性渗透性也较好。这样就润滑了钻具，浮脱出岩粉，冷却了钻头，保壁作用也良好，有效地防止了井壁坍塌和掉块。四、把钻头水口由长一五○粍改为一二○粍，水口宽一○二粍改为八一粍。因此排水量便由七○公斤减到三○公斤，节省用水一倍以上。（安岗）
    麻版纸箱能代替木箱包装货物
    代替木箱装载商品的麻版纸箱在经过长距离运输的试验后，证明价廉耐用，目前正大力推广。
    运输试验由中国百货公司上海采购供应站装载电池、电珠、口琴、球鞋、复写纸、日记本等二十三种商品，分别由上海运往北京、天津、山东潍县三地。检查结果，所装载的商品在达到目的地后全部没有损坏。在试验中，北京、天津等地采购供应批发站职工又提出了一些改进的意见，使新的麻版纸箱更加完善。
    中央人民政府商业部已指示中国百货公司上海采购供应站在“边用边改进”的方针下开始使用新麻版纸箱。（据新华社讯）
    人民解放军藏民团进行农业生产
    康藏高原上藏族人民的武装部队——中国人民解放军藏民团，正紧张地展开农业生产工作。曾获得
    “建设先锋”称号的某连，由六十多个战士组成一支生产队，展开了红旗竞赛，按时种上小麦和青稞。现在全团已完成了一千三百多亩地的春耕播种工作。这些土地是他们去年开垦出来的。去年种植的小麦、青稞和其他农作物都得到丰收。这些藏族人民的子弟兵，在生产中采取了汉族地区先进的耕作方法，给藏族农民树立了发展生产的良好榜样。很多藏族农民骑着马，从数十里地以外赶来参观使用马拉犁，学习点种和施肥等耕作技术。藏民团的指挥员、战斗员们把先进的耕作技术耐心地教给他们，并赠送了一些农具和康藏高原上从来没有种植过的作物品种。在农忙季节，藏民团还热情地帮助当地农民犁地、灌水、收割庄稼。（新华社）
    云南保山区兴建大盈江防洪工程
    云南省保山专区贯穿梁河、盈江、莲山三县的大盈江防洪工程，已在五月底修建完成。大盈江河谷是傣族人民聚居的地方，过去每遇洪水泛滥，附近村庄和田亩多被淹没。去年，盈江县人民政府曾领导当地人民修堤筑坝，减少了灾害。今年四月初，保山专署又成立大盈江防洪工程委员会，拨发了大批粮食和材料费，兴建规模较大的防洪工程。这项工程，共计用了约四万九千多个工，整修和新筑的江堤有一万三千多公尺，受益田地达六万七千多亩，估计可增产稻谷三百万斤。
    在工程进行中，当地傣族人民自动参加修筑，附近各族农民也支援这一工程的兴建。腾冲县汉族人民出了一千多个工，协助修筑梁河老沙坝江堤；盈江山区的山头族、傈僳族等人民也运来竹架和木材，并参加修堤工作。（新华社）
    宁夏正在建设一座毛纺织厂
    宁夏省正在建设一座地方国营的毛纺织厂。厂房工程已在去年五月开始动工，预计今年年底完成。
    宁夏省大部分地区是牧区，解放后羊毛产量逐渐增加。这个厂开工后，宁夏省外销的羊毛就可以在这里洗净后装运出去。按一百斤粗羊毛出产五十斤净羊毛计算，洗净后可使运输费用节省一半。这个厂还将生产适当数量的毛毯和呢子，供应宁夏各族人民的需要。（新华社）
