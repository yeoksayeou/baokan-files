    Xinhua News Agency, June 14th, Dispatch from TASS, Paris, June 13th: The 29th Congress of the French General Confederation of Labor (CGT), after five days of meetings, concluded in Paris on June 12th. A total of 2,740 delegates participated in the congress, representing 3,276,000 union members.

    The congress passed a number of resolutions demanding higher wages for working people, opposing infringements on the social insurance system and other interests of the French working class, and calling for a struggle against unemployment. The congress also passed resolutions on fighting for peace and on the French working class's solidarity with the heroic struggles of the people of colonial and dependent countries for national independence.

    The resolution on the CGT Executive Bureau's report emphasized that working people must expand joint action in their struggle for peace, democracy, national independence, and a higher standard of living.

    Amid shouts of "Release Alain Le Leap!" "Fascism Will Not Pass!" and cheers, the meeting elected a new CGT Executive Bureau. Benoît Frachon and Alain Le Leap were elected General Secretaries of the CGT.

    The meeting sent a delegation to the French National Assembly, demanding an end to the persecution of leaders of democratic organizations and the release of Alain Le Leap, General Secretary of the French General Confederation of Labor, Organizing Secretary Lucio Molino, editor-in-chief of "l'Humanité", André Stil, and leaders of the Republican Youth of France, who were illegally arrested.

    Xinhua News Agency, June 14th, Dispatch from TASS, Paris, June 12th: The 29th Congress of the French General Confederation of Labor passed a resolution on the French government crisis on the 11th. The resolution emphasized that the current government crisis in France occurred at a time when unemployment and the economic crisis were very serious, which proves that "the North Atlantic policy, which is opposed by the entire working class and the majority of the country, has encountered a serious crisis in France." The resolution also pointed out that the reactionary forces in France "are making a last-ditch struggle to continue implementing this policy, taking a step forward on the road to fascism."

    The resolution demanded the establishment in France of a government that would guarantee an end to the Vietnam War, reduce the unbearable burden of military spending, stop persecuting leaders of the working class, restore the democratic freedoms guaranteed by the Constitution, and resolve France's economic and social problems "in accordance with the methods proposed by the CGT."

    要求建立保证结束越南战争减轻军费负担的政府
    【新华社十四日讯】塔斯社巴黎十三日讯：法国总工会第二十九届代表大会在举行了五天会议后，于六月十二日在巴黎闭幕。参加这次大会的代表共有两千七百四十人，代表着三百二十七万六千工会会员。
    大会通过了一些决定，要求提高劳动人民的工资，反对侵犯社会保险制度和法国工人阶级的其他利益，并要求为反对失业而斗争。大会并通过了关于争取和平和法国工人阶级声援殖民地附属国人民争取民族独立的英勇战斗的决定。
    关于总工会执行局的报告的决议强调：劳动人民在他们为和平、民主、民族独立与较高的生活水平而作的斗争中，必须扩大联合行动。
    会议在高呼“释放阿兰·勒里普！”“法西斯主义行不通！”的口号声与欢呼声中，选出了新的总工会执行局。贝诺瓦·弗拉商与阿兰·勒里普被选为总工会总书记。
    会议派出了代表团向法国国民议会，要求停止迫害民主组织的领袖，并释放被非法逮捕的法国总工会总书记阿兰·勒里普、组织书记吕希欧·摩林诺、
    “人道报”总编辑安德烈·斯梯以及法兰西共和青年联盟的领袖们。
    【新华社十四日讯】塔斯社巴黎十二日讯：法国总工会第二十九届代表大会在十一日通过了关于法国政府危机的决议。决议着重指出：目前法国的政府危机是在失业和经济危机非常严重的时候发生的，这证明了“全体工人阶级和国内大多数人都反对的北大西洋政策在法国发生了严重的危机”。决议同时指出：法国的反动势力“正在作垂死挣扎来继续执行这个政策，在走向法西斯主义的道路上向前跨进一步。”
    决议要求在法国建立这样一个政府：这个政府要保证结束越南战争，减轻不可忍受的军费负担，停止迫害工人阶级的领袖，恢复宪法所保证的民主自由，并且“按照总工会所建议的办法” 来解决法国的经济问题和社会问题。
