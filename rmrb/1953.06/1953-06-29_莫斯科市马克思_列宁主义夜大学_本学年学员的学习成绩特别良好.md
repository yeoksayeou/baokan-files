    Moscow City Marxist-Leninist Evening University
    This Academic Year's Students Achieve Particularly Excellent Results
    [Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 22nd] Soviet cadres in active service attach great importance to the study of Marxist-Leninist theory. The "Moscow Evening News" reported on the 19th about the study situation at the Moscow City Marxist-Leninist Evening University, which powerfully illustrates this fact.
    The Moscow City Marxist-Leninist Evening University is a two-year program. More than 400 professors from Moscow universities and staff from scientific institutions participate in lecturing and tutoring students. Every year, thousands of people graduate from here. This academic year, the school established many branch schools in the district committees of the Soviet Communist Party, the party committees of various departments of the Soviet government, and cultural institutions, with a total of about 16,000 students. Recently, about 7,000 people are about to graduate, including cadres from party, government, and economic departments, engineers, teachers, scientific workers, professors, architects, and artists. Due to the evening university's teachers paying special attention to improving the level of teaching and research, improving teaching methods, and the active learning of students, the students' academic performance this year has been particularly excellent. For example, in the Kiev District Party Committee branch school of the university, out of 253 people who took the philosophy exam, 179 received the highest grade, 64 received excellent grades, and only 10 received medium grades.
    The Moscow City Marxist-Leninist Evening University will also add several branch schools in the next academic year. The school has already begun enrollment and has recruited more than 500 scientific workers and more than 100 artists.

    莫斯科市马克思—列宁主义夜大学
    本学年学员的学习成绩特别良好
    【新华社莫斯科二十二日电】苏联的在职干部非常重视马克思—列宁主义理论的学习。“莫斯科晚报”十九日报道的莫斯科市马克思—列宁主义夜大学的学习情况，有力地说明了这一事实。
    莫斯科市马克思—列宁主义夜大学是两年制的。参加讲课和辅导学员研究的有莫斯科各大学的教授和科学机关的工作人员四百多人。每年都有几千人从这儿毕业。该校本学年在苏联共产党各区委员会、苏联政府各部党委会和文化机关，设立了许多分校，共约有一万六千名学员。最近，约有七千人即将毕业，其中包括党、政、经济部门的干部、工程师、教师、科学工作者、教授、建筑师和艺术工作者。由于夜大学的教师特别注意提高教学和研究的水平，改进了教学方法，以及学员积极学习的结果，本学年学员的学习成绩特别良好。譬如，在该校基辅区党委会分校中，参加哲学考试的有二百五十三人，其中有一百七十九人得了最优等成绩，六十四人得了优等成绩，得中等成绩的只有十个人。
    莫斯科市马克思—列宁主义夜大学在下一学年还将增设几个分校。该校现已开始招生，已招收了五百多名科学工作者和一百多名艺术工作者。
