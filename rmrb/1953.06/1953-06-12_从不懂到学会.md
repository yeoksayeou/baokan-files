    From Not Understanding to Learning
    Zhang Weiqi
    In the motherland's large-scale economic construction, many new things are placed before veteran and new cadres. Chairman Mao taught us: "We must overcome difficulties, we must learn things we do not understand. ... Delve into it; a few months, a year or two, three or five years, and you can always learn it." Many cadres, following this instruction, are gradually learning things they do not understand. What is introduced here is just a very ordinary example.
    Duan Faxiang was transferred from the Chahar Provincial Department Store to the Dispatching and Progress Section of the Hardware and Electrical Import Company affiliated with the Ministry of Foreign Trade on February 1, 1953. Since joining the revolution in 1945, he had been working as an accountant. Now, his new job required him to check the shipping notifications, invoices, bills of lading, packing lists, and quality specifications sent from abroad. If he found any errors, he had to inquire with relevant units; if there were no errors, he would register and compile statistics, and send them to the land transportation company for the user departments to handle the allocation and transportation work. However, the shipping notifications, packing lists, invoices, and bills of lading sent from abroad were all in English, and Duan Faxiang was a cadre who only achieved a higher primary school education through self-study. He didn't even recognize a single English letter, so how could he check for problems? With the specific help of his comrades, he could only check the quantity of goods received and the total amount; other items that should be checked, such as the number of pieces received, weight, specifications, unit price, port of arrival, user departments, etc. … he couldn't understand any of it. The section accumulated a lot of work that could not be processed in a timely manner. Therefore, he was very distressed and felt that it would be better to do the accounting work he was familiar with. He once requested a transfer from the manager. The manager persuaded and encouraged him. Later, he thought that he was a Communist Party member, so why couldn't he overcome this difficulty? So, he decided to improve himself. He found Shao Shiyuan, a colleague in the section who was more knowledgeable in the business and had a foreign language foundation, and signed a three-month "contract for teaching and learning" with him. The contract stipulated that from March 1st to June 31st, Shao Shiyuan would teach him to recognize English letters, phonetics, commonly used unit names in work, relevant port locations, major foreign language specifications for hardware and electrical categories, commodity names, and commercial terms related to international trade, so that he would have the ability to work independently in his business. Duan Faxiang also signed a contract with another comrade, Zhang Weichuan, to learn how to handle insurance claims.
    For more than two months, because both parties conscientiously implemented the teaching contract, they completed the three-month learning plan a week ahead of schedule. In terms of foreign languages, Duan Faxiang not only learned English letters and phonetics, but also recognized the quantity of goods, hardware product names, major electrical equipment names, simple specifications, shipping locations, user departments, major foreign language words on transportation documents, and commonly used transaction terms in foreign trade that needed to be checked on invoices and bills of lading. In terms of transportation operations, he also knew how to handle the procedures and steps of import and export trade, how to determine the allocation object of goods received, and how to check the contract number. As he himself said: "Now I can not only understand the items on the invoice, but I can also see problems. For example, how much goods have been received, what goods have not arrived, how much has been paid, how much is owed, and whether the specifications match the original order can all be understood, so I can proactively provide materials for expediting delivery, and I can also inquire with relevant parties about accidents involving damage, defects, or shortages in all goods received, and handle compensation for losses for user departments." Shao Shiyuan said: "Now Duan Faxiang has taken over part of the work I originally did, can fully grasp the progress registration of orders placed in 1951 and 1953, and can independently handle problems that occur in the work."
    In this way, Shao Shiyuan can free up his energy to handle the expediting of imported materials, deal with more complex issues, and delve into new tasks. Why could Duan Faxiang take on a job he knew nothing about after only studying for more than two months?
    First of all, it was because Duan Faxiang, under the education of the Party and administrative leaders, and encouraged by the company's patriotic labor competition, understood that national economic construction depends on us, so he changed his mindset of not being at ease in his work because he didn't understand it, strengthened his will to overcome difficulties, resolved to learn if he didn't understand, humbly learned from his comrades, adhered to the learning plan specified in his teaching contract, and engaged in arduous self-study. He recited and wrote whatever Shao Shiyuan taught him whenever he had time, and insisted on studying for two hours every day after getting off work; he also paid attention to combining his daily work with his studies, and asked his comrades for advice whenever he encountered something he didn't understand, so he remembered quickly, and what he learned could be immediately used in his work, and he became more and more motivated as he learned.
    Another reason is that comrades Shao Shiyuan and Zhang Weichuan patiently and systematically helped Duan Faxiang. According to the requirements of the contract, Shao Shiyuan made a specific three-month education plan, and compiled practical lectures on the foreign languages needed for daily work, from simple to complex; in terms of teaching methods, he paid attention to increasing the learner's interest, often encouraged and strengthened his confidence, and also established a testing system. Zhang Weichuan summarized his experience in insurance claims work, and combined it with the problems that occurred in his daily work, and taught Duan Faxiang and other comrades in the section the specific handling methods and procedures. Because they helped Duan Faxiang so enthusiastically, responsibly, and without fear of trouble, they shortened Duan Faxiang's exploration process and enabled him to make rapid progress. Facts have proved that comrades with low education levels, who do not know foreign languages, and do not understand business, can quickly improve themselves and become familiar with their business as long as they are willing to humbly and diligently learn from their comrades. Only those who are afraid of difficulties and are lazy will always remain at their original level and unable to move forward.
    The facts tell us that in order to meet the needs of the current economic construction development and quickly help a large number of new cadres and transferred cadres learn the business and improve work efficiency, it is the glorious responsibility of many comrades who know more about the business and technology.
    Experience has also proven that the "contract for teaching and learning" is an effective way to train cadres and improve their business in practical work. According to the three-month practice of China National Hardware and Electrical Import Corporation, all comrades who participated in the "contract for teaching and learning" have improved their business level and work efficiency. For example, comrades You Dahao and Gao Zhenhuan learned English typing from Jin Changsheng. Kong Ci'an learned to translate Russian letters and telegrams from Li Shaoxian and created a simple method of translation. There are also nine typists who learned how to repair typewriters. Xie Fuxi, a young man who had just graduated from school, also learned how to handle insurance claims from Zhang Weichuan. Therefore, the experience of signing and implementing the "contract for teaching and learning" is worth promoting.

    从不懂到学会
    张维奇
    在祖国大规模的经济建设当中，许许多多的新事物摆在老干部和新干部面前。毛主席教导我们说：“我们必须克服困难，我们必须学会自己不懂的东西。……钻进去，几个月，一年两年，三年五年，总可以学会的。”不少的干部遵照这个指示，正在逐渐学会自己不懂的东西。这里介绍的，仅是一个很平凡的例子。
    段发祥，是一九五三年二月一日，由察哈尔省百货公司调到中央对外贸易部所属五金电工进口公司调运进程科来工作的。他从一九四五年参加革命以来，一直是作会计工作。现在这个新的工作岗位上需要他作的，却是查对国外寄来的发货通知书，发票、提单、装箱单、品质说明书等。如果发现差错，他就要向有关单位进行查问；没有差错就进行登记统计，送交陆运公司给用货部门办理拨运工作。但是，国外寄来的发货通知书、装箱单、发票、提单全是英文字，而段发祥是靠自修才达到高小文化程度的干部，他连一个英文字母也不认识，如何能查对出问题来呢？在同志们的具体帮助下，他开始只能查对到货数量及总金额两项数目字；其他应该查对的到货件数、重量、规格、单价、到达口岸，用货部门等……他都看不懂。科内积压很多工作不能及时处理。因此，他非常苦闷，感到不如作自己所熟习的会计工作好。他曾向经理提出了调动工作的要求。经理对他进行说服并鼓励他。后来，他想到自己是一个共产党员，为什么这点困难也不能克服呢？于是，他下决心提高自己。他找到本科一位较懂业务又有外文基础的邵士元，和他订立了三个月的包教包学合同。合同中规定，从三月一日起到六月三十一日止邵士元要教他能认识英文字母、拼音，工作中常用的单位名称，有关口岸地点，五金电工类的主要外文规格，商品品名，以及国际贸易方面的商业术语，使他在业务上有单独工作的能力。段发祥还和另外一位同志张渭川订了学会办理保险索赔工作的合同。
    两个多月来，由于双方认真地执行了教学合同，他们已提前一个星期完成了三个月的学习计划。段发祥在外文方面不但学会了英文字母及拼音，而且认识了发票上、提单上要查对的商品数量、五金品名、主要电力器材品名、简单规格、发货地点、用货部门、运输单据上的主要外文单字，和对外贸易上一般采用的成交条款等外文字。在调运业务上，关于进出口贸易的程序与步骤，如何确定到货的拨付对象，合同号的查对方法，他也知道怎样办了。正如他自己说的：“现在我不但能看懂发票上的项目，还能看出问题来了。如已到货多少，什么货未到，已承付多少，欠多少款未付，规格是否和原来订货相符，都可以看明白，因此，我就能够主动供给办理催交工作的材料，所有到货中损坏残短的事故，也能寻问有关方面，给用货部门办理赔偿损失了。”邵士元说：“现在段发祥已分担起我原来作的一部分工作，能够全面掌握起一九五一年及一九五三年订货的进程登记工作，并能独立处理工作中发生的问题。”
    这样，邵士元就能腾出力量办理进口物资的催交工作，处理较复杂的问题，并能钻研新的任务了。为什么段发祥仅仅学习了两个多月，就能担负起一个完全不懂的工作呢？
    首先，就是由于段发祥在党和行政领导的教育下，在公司爱国主义劳动竞赛的鼓舞下，懂得了国家经济建设就是靠我们来建设，因此，转变了因为不懂而不安心工作的思想，坚定了克服困难的意志，下定了不懂就学的决心，虚心地向同志们学习，坚持执行了自己在教学合同中规定的学习计划，进行刻苦自修。邵士元教的东西，他有空就念，就写，每天下班回家都坚持学习两个钟头；还注意结合每日的工作努力学习，碰到不明白的地方就随时向同志们请教，所以记得很快，学的东西马上就能用在工作上，他越学也越起劲。
    另一个原因，就是邵士元和张渭川两位同志耐心地有计划地帮助了段发祥。邵士元根据合同的要求，作出了三个月的具体教育计划，并把日常工作需用的外文，由浅入深地编写了切合实际的讲义；在教育方法上，注意了提高学习者的兴趣，时常鼓励和加强他的信心，还建立了测验制度。张渭川总结了自己作保险索赔工作的经验，并结合日常工作中发生的问题，把具体的处理办法和一套手续，教给段发祥及本科的其他同志。由于他们这样热忱地、认真负责地、不怕麻烦地帮助了段发祥，因此，缩短了段发祥摸索的过程，使他能够迅速进步。事实证明：文化程度低，不认识外文，不懂业务的同志，只要肯虚心努力地向同志们学习，是可以很快提高自己和熟习业务的。只有怕困难的思想懒汉，才会永远停留在原来的水平上不能前进。
    事实告诉我们：为了适应目前经济建设发展的需要，迅速地帮助大批新干部和转业干部学会业务，提高工作效率，是许多比较懂得业务和技术的同志们的光荣责任。
    经验也证明：“包教包学合同”是在实际工作中培养干部提高业务的有效办法。根据中国五金电工进口公司三个多月的实践，凡是参加了包教包学合同的同志，在业务水平及工作效率上都提高了。如尤大灏、高振寰二同志就向金长生学会了英文打字。孔赐安向李绍先学会了翻译俄文函电，并创造了翻译的简便办法。还有九个打字员学会了装修打字机的办法。新从学校出来的青年谢福熙也向张渭川学会了办理保险索赔的办法。因此，签订和执行包教包学合同的经验是值得推广的。
