Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 12th: The State Minister of the Yoshida government and head of the disguised military department, the "Security Agency," Tokutaro Kimura, revealed in Fukuoka on the 9th a "five-year land, sea, and air defense plan that is close to completion of drafting." This rearmament plan immediately met with strong opposition from various parties in Japan.

According to the Japanese rearmament plan revealed by Tokutaro Kimura, Japan's disguised army, the "Security Force," will be expanded to 205,000 people within five years; the "Maritime Safety Force's" warships will be increased to 143,000 tons; and an air force with 1,530 aircraft, including 480 jet aircraft, will be established. Tokutaro Kimura said: "This plan will not be affected by the Korean armistice or the withdrawal of US troops from Korea after the armistice." Kyodo News Agency revealed that this plan is a scheme by the Yoshida government to accelerate rearmament at the request of the United States in exchange for US "Mutual Security Agency Aid." Kyodo News Agency said:
	"Observers believe that: because the issue of the United States giving Japan Mutual Security Agency aid has become a major issue at home and abroad, (the Yoshida) government must prepare its own defense plan."

The Yoshida government's rearmament plan was immediately met with fierce opposition from the broad masses of the Japanese public. Various bourgeois opposition parties also sharply criticized the Yoshida cabinet's secret planning to rearm Japan as a violation of the constitution. The left-wing Socialist Party and the right-wing Socialist Party pointed out that Kimura's "defense plan" clearly showed the Yoshida government's hypocritical attitude toward rearmament. They also stated that they would hold the Yoshida government accountable in the Diet.

The violent reaction to the rearmament plan made the Yoshida government very flustered. Yoshida hurriedly consulted with Chief Cabinet Secretary Kenji Fukunaga on countermeasures on the morning of the 10th and instructed him to issue a statement denying that "what Kimura announced does not represent the government's opinion." However, Yoshida's ostrich-like tactics cannot cover up the truth. Reuters Tokyo reported: "Although the official denied it in this way, political observers here believe that Kimura's statement was issued on behalf of the government, with the purpose of testing: what would the public's reaction be if Japan was forced to accelerate rearmament in exchange for US military aid?"

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 12th: Recent investigations by the Japanese police revealed that the notorious Japanese Kempeitai (military police) of the pre-war era is being revived. The "Ken'yukai" - the Kempeitai Friendship Association, composed of former Japanese Kempeitai personnel, has been established in six prefectures since last summer. In addition, small organizations of former Kempeitai are scattered throughout Japan.

The Japanese police authorities revealed that these former Kempeitai personnel are planning to establish a central organization in Tokyo this autumn.

### 吉田政府“保安厅”头子透露日本重整军备计划  日本人民和资产阶级反对党都激烈反对

    吉田政府“保安厅”头子透露日本重整军备计划
    日本人民和资产阶级反对党都激烈反对
    【新华社十二日讯】东京消息：吉田政府国务相兼变相军部“保安厅”长官木村笃太郎，九日在福冈透露了一个“接近草拟完成的五年陆海空防御计划”。这个重整军备的计划立即遭到日本多方面的强烈反对。
    按照木村笃太郎透露的日本重整军备计划，日本的变相陆军“保安队”将在五年内扩充到二十万五千人；“海上警备队”的军舰将增加到十四万三千吨；并建立一支拥有一千五百三十架飞机的空军，其中包括喷气式飞机四百八十架。木村笃太郎说：“这个计划不会受到朝鲜停战以及停战后美军从朝鲜撤退的影响。”共同社透露，这个计划就是吉田政府在美国的要求下为了换取美国“共同安全署援助”而提出的加紧重新武装的方案。共同社说：
    “观察家们认为：由于美国给日本以共同安全署援助的问题已经在国内和国外成为一个很大的问题，
    （吉田）政府必须要准备一个它自己的防御计划。”
    吉田政府这个重整军备计划立刻就受到日本广大公众的激烈反对。各资产阶级反对党也尖锐抨击吉田新内阁秘密策划重新武装日本是违反宪法的。左派社会党和右派社会党指出：木村的“防御计划”清楚地表明了吉田政府对重整军备采取了伪善的态度。它们并表示将在国会上追究吉田政府的责任。
    对于重整军备计划的剧烈反应，使吉田政府十分慌张。吉田急忙在十日早晨和内阁官房长官福永健司会商对策，并授意他发表声明抵赖说：“木村所宣布的并不代表政府的意见”。但是，吉田的这种掩耳盗铃的手段是无法掩盖事实真相的。路透社东京电说：“虽然官方这样的加以否认，此间的政治观察家们却认为木村的声明是代替政府发表的，目的是试探一下：假使日本被迫加速重整军备以换取美国军事援助的话，公众的反应是什么？”
    【新华社十二日讯】东京消息：日本警察方面最近的调查透露，战前臭名远扬的日本宪兵队正在复活中。由战前日本宪兵人员所组成的“宪友会”——宪兵之友协会，自去年夏季起已先后在六个县内成立起来。此外在日本各地还散布着前宪兵队的小型组织。
    日本警察当局透露：这些旧宪兵队人员，正计划今年秋季在东京成立一个中央机构。
