Report on the Revision of the Constitution of the All-China Youth Federation
Qian Weichang

Fellow Representatives:

The "Constitution of the All-China Democratic Youth Federation" passed by the First National Youth Congress in 1949, we believe, is basically correct. We have been working in accordance with the purpose and organizational principles stipulated in the constitution. However, in the past four years, significant changes have taken place in the objective situation throughout the country. The reactionary rule of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang has been overthrown, and the People's Republic of China has been established, achieving great accomplishments in various fields since its founding. Our motherland has now entered a new period of the first national Five-Year Plan for construction. In this new historical period, in order to ensure that our organizational charter conforms to the changed new objective situation and is adapted to the new tasks assigned to the youth by the motherland, it is necessary to make some necessary revisions and supplements to the original constitution. Furthermore, based on the experience of the past four years, we also believe that some matters stipulated in the past constitution need to be corrected. We believe that the revision of the constitution will further strengthen the great unity of the nation's youth and enable us to march in step and strive to meet the new historical tasks.

Here, the issue of the name of this federation must be raised first. The original name of this federation was "All-China Democratic Youth Federation." According to the draft constitution, it is proposed to change the name to "All-China Youth Federation." Since the words "All-China" and "Federation" already exist in the name, adding the word "General" is obviously redundant, so it is deleted. Furthermore, the regulations of this federation were originally called "Concise Constitution," but in the past four years, this federation has not formulated any other detailed rules, and in fact, there is no need to formulate detailed rules in the future. Therefore, based on the principle of seeking truth from facts, it is officially named "Constitution."

In addition, regarding the revision of the constitution, there are the following explanations:

I. On the Nature and Purpose of the Federation

As everyone knows, the All-China Youth Federation (hereinafter referred to as the Youth Federation) is a national youth organization with a united front nature. This organization should include young men and women of all democratic classes, all nationalities, and different religious beliefs and occupations. This organization has the task of uniting the nation's youth as broadly as possible and should align its activities in all aspects with the current struggle direction of the people of the country. The Chinese youth movement has always been advancing under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong, and only under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong can the Chinese youth movement develop correctly and avoid losing its way on the road forward. Therefore, in the newly added general program of the draft constitution, it is first clearly defined that the Youth Federation is a national youth organization that includes all democratic classes and all nationalities, regardless of religious belief, occupation, or gender; this youth organization is under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong.

In the constitution passed by the First National Youth Congress in 1949, when talking about the purpose of this federation, it was proposed to list "striving for the complete victory of the New Democratic Revolution" and "completing the construction of the New Democratic state" on an equal footing, which was correct at the time. Because the primary task at that time was to carry out the People's Liberation War to the end and to completely smash the rule of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang throughout the country. But today, if we still maintain this statement, it obviously cannot conform to the objective situation. Because, in the past four years, the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and their leader Chairman Mao Zedong, have not only overthrown the reactionary rule of the Chiang bandits, completed a series of social reforms, achieved a fundamental turnaround in the financial and economic situation, resisted the aggression of American imperialism, but have also begun to enter a new historical period. This requires us to stipulate the purpose of this federation based on the current new historical situation, requiring us to take actively participating in the country's construction cause, gradually realizing the country's industrialization, and gradually transitioning to socialism as the primary task of the nation's youth. Chinese youth should work together with the people of the country to complete the country's economic construction with the greatest effort, so that our country can gradually realize industrialization and gradually transition to a socialist society, realizing a happier and better future for the youth. This is the overall spirit of the purpose of this federation contained in the draft constitution.

In addition, in order to ensure that we can smoothly complete the country's various construction tasks, we must always be vigilant against the imperialists' aggressive conspiracies and strengthen our motherland's national defense; therefore, in the purpose of this federation, it is also pointed out that the nation's youth should assume the sacred duty of defending the motherland together with the people of the country; and they should also strive together with the youth of the world for lasting peace throughout the world.

II. On the Membership of the National Youth Federation

As mentioned earlier, the National Youth Federation is a national youth organization with a united front nature. Due to this nature of the National Youth Federation, we must adopt a group membership system. Because only by adopting a group membership system can the National Youth Federation easily carry out many of the broadest and most diverse forms of activities, and only then can it most favorably achieve its goal of uniting the vast number of young people.

The adoption of the group membership system is the same in the "Draft Constitution" and the original constitution. However, Article 3 of the original constitution stipulated: "However, when necessary, individuals who cannot be included in youth organizations but have influence and contribution among the youth masses and are helpful to the work of this federation may be accepted as individual members." Now, as everyone has seen in the new "Draft Constitution," this point has been removed. This is because in 1949, at the First National Youth Congress, it was necessary to allow individual members in the National Youth Federation. Because at that time, the country had not yet been completely liberated, and in a considerable part of the region, the reactionary rule of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang had not been destroyed. Therefore, in those places, there were also many young people who had not yet been organized, and they did not have a suitable group to join. If at that time, the National Youth Federation did not allow any individual members, then it would not be possible to shut out the numerous young people in these areas from our organization. Now, this situation no longer exists. Now, the vast majority of young people across the country have already joined various youth organizations that are suitable for themselves, whether this youth organization or that youth organization. Moreover, in all parts of the country, there are various youth organizations of different natures suitable for youths of different occupations and different classes, allowing those young people who are willing to participate in group activities to choose to join, which makes it unnecessary and superfluous to retain individual members in the National Youth Federation. This is the explanation that should be given on the issue of membership.

In addition, it should be added here that because the National Youth Federation needs to carry out many diverse activities, there should also be various forms of organizing the youth masses. Therefore, Article 14 has been added to the new constitution, stipulating that the constitutions of youth federations in various provinces, cities, and autonomous regions can be separately formulated by the local youth congress or representative meeting according to the actual local conditions and work needs.

III. On the Rights and Obligations of Members

All cultural, educational, and welfare undertakings held by this federation should serve the vast number of young people and should not emphasize the priority rights of members. Therefore, Article 5, Item C of Chapter II of the Draft Constitution has been cancelled. Furthermore, the issue of paying membership dues is mentioned in Chapter III of the Draft Constitution. Therefore, Item C of Article 6 of the original constitution has also been deleted. According to the new Draft Constitution, the rights and obligations of members are all merged into four items, A, B, C, and D, in Article 2 of Chapter I.

IV. On the Handling of Members Who Violate the Purpose of the Constitution

Because the original constitution was not perfect enough, it is now changed to "If a member of this federation has any behavior that violates the purpose of this federation's constitution, appropriate disposition may be given upon the resolution of the National Congress or the National Committee." This will take care of various different situations and can be used more flexibly.

V. On the Organization of This Federation for Handling Daily Work

The work of the Youth Federation has greatly developed in the past four years, but the daily work organization of the National Youth Federation is still very unsound, and all affairs are handled by the Secretariat. Under the Chairman and Vice-Chairmen, the National Youth Federation lacks the necessary division of labor and responsible work organization. Therefore, there are too few cadres, both part-time and full-time, which results in many tasks that should be done not being done well. Last year, under the care and guidance of Chairman Mao, the direction and tasks of the Youth Federation were clearly defined, and future work must be strengthened. In order to effectively promote the work of the Youth Federation, strengthening the General Assembly's working organization has become an urgent problem to be solved. Articles 10, 11, and 12 of the revised draft are proposed to solve this urgent problem.

VI. On Funding

According to the actual situation in recent years, it is changed to "The source of funding is: membership dues of member organizations and social donations."

Whether the draft revision of the constitution and the above explanations are appropriate, we respectfully request the Congress to review and decide.

    关于修改中华全国民主青年联合总会简章的报告
    钱伟长各位代表：
    一九四九年，中华全国青年第一次代表大会所通过的“中华全国民主青年联合总会简章”，我们认为基本上是正确的。我们一直是依照简章上所规定的宗旨和组织方针进行工作的。但是四年以来，在全国客观情况上已发生重大的变化，蒋介石匪帮的反动统治已被推翻，中华人民共和国业已成立，在成立以后取得了各方面的伟大成就。我们的祖国现已进入第一个国家五年计划建设的新时期。在这个新的历史时期里，为了使我们的组织章程能够符合于已经改变了的新的客观情况，能够和祖国赋予青年的新任务相适应，就必须对原来的简章做一些必要的修改和补充。此外，根据四年来的经验，我们还认为过去简章中所规定的某些事项，也有加以改正的必要。我们相信，对于简章的修改，将会更进一步地加强全国青年的大团结，将使得我们更加能够步伐整齐地为迎接新的历史任务而奋斗。
    这里必须首先提出的是关于本会的名称问题。本会原定名为“中华全国民主青年联合总会”，按照章程草案拟更名为“中华全国民主青年联合会”。因为在名称上，既已有了“中华全国”与“联合会”的字样，再加上“总”字显然是多余的，所以删去。又本会规章，原名“简章”，可是四年来除此之外，本会并未另订什么详细的章则，而且实际上在今后也无另订详细章则的需要，因此本着实事求是的原则，正名为“章程”。
    另外，关于简章的修改，还有以下各项说明：
    一、关于本会的性质和宗旨问题
    如大家所知道的，中华全国民主青年联合会（以下简称青联）是一个统一战线性质的全国性的青年团体。在这个团体里面应包括各民主阶级、各民族及不同宗教信仰和不同职业的男女青年。这个团体负有尽可能广泛地把全国青年团结起来的任务，并应使自己在各方面的活动与全国人民当前的奋斗方向相一致。中国青年运动一直是在中国共产党和毛泽东主席领导之下前进的，而且也只有在中国共产党和毛泽东主席领导之下，中国青年运动才能得到正确的发展，而不致于在前进的路途中迷失方向。因此，在章程草案的新增添的总纲中，便首先明白地确定：青联是一个不分宗教信仰、职业、性别，包括各民主阶级、各民族的全国性的青年团体；这个青年团体是在中国共产党和毛泽东主席领导之下的。
    在一九四九年第一次全国青年代表大会所通过的简章里面讲到关于本会的宗旨问题时，曾把“争取新民主主义革命的彻底胜利”与“完成新民主主义国家的建设事业”平列地提出，这在当时是正确的。因为当时首要的任务，是将人民解放战争进行到底，要在全国范围内彻底粉碎蒋介石匪帮的统治。但今天，如果仍保持这样的提法显然已不能符合于客观情况了。因为，四年以来，中国人民在中国共产党和自己的领袖毛泽东主席领导下，不仅已推翻了蒋匪的反动统治，完成了一系列的社会改革，取得了财政经济情况的根本好转，抗击了美帝国主义的侵略，而且已开始进入一个新的历史时期。这样就要求我们，必须根据当前新的历史情况，来规定本会的宗旨，要求我们必须把积极参加国家的建设事业，逐步实现国家的工业化，逐步过渡到社会主义，作为当前全国青年的首要任务。中国青年应当和全国人民一起，用最大的努力来完成国家的经济建设工作，使我国逐步地实现工业化和逐步地过渡到社会主义社会，实现青年的更幸福、更美好的未来。这就是包含在章程草案中的本会宗旨的总的精神。
    此外，为了保证我们能够顺利地完成国家的各项建设工作，还必须时刻警惕帝国主义者的侵略阴谋，必须加强我们祖国的国防；因此，在本会的宗旨中，还指出全国青年应和全国人民一起负起保卫祖国的神圣职务；并且还要和全世界青年一起，为争取全世界的持久和平而奋斗。
    二、关于全国青联的会员问题
    如前所述，全国青联是一个统一战线性质的全国范围的青年团体。由于全国青联的这样一种性质，就使得我们必须采取团体会员制。因为只有采用团体会员制才能便于全国青联展开许多最广泛的多种多样的活动形式，才能最有利于其达到团结广大青年的目的。
    采用团体会员制这一点，在“章程草案”上和原有的简章上所规定的并无不同。不过在原有的简章上第三条中曾规定：“但于必要时，得吸收青年团体所不能包括而在青年群众中有影响与贡献，并对本会工作有帮助之人士为个人会员。”现在，在新的“章程草案”中，如大家所看到的，已把这一点取消了。这是因为在一九四九年，第一次全国青年代表大会时，在全国青联中允许有个人会员是必要的。因为当时，全国还未曾全部解放，还有不小的一部分地区，蒋介石匪帮的反动统治未曾摧毁。因此，在那些地方，也就有不少的青年还未曾组织起来，他们没有适当的团体可以参加。如果在那时，全国青联不允许有任何个人会员，那末，就不能不把这样一些地区的，人数众多的青年关在我们这个团体的门外。现在，这种情况已不复存在了。现在全国青年绝大部分都已经参加了各种适合于自己的这一青年团体或那一青年团体。而且在全国各地，也都有各种不同性质的适合于各不同职业不同阶层的青年团体存在，任凭那些愿意参加团体活动的青年选择参加，这样就使在全国青联中再保留个人会员，成为不必要的多余的了。这就是在关于会员问题上应有的说明。
    此外，在这里还须附带说一下的，就是由于全国青联须要进行许多多种多样的活动，因此，也就应有各种不同的组织青年群众的形式，所以，在新的章程中增添了第十四条，规定各省、市及自治区青年联合团体的章程，可以按当地的实际情况和工作需要，由当地青年代表大会或代表会议另定之。
    三、关于会员的权利与义务问题
    本会举办的一切文化教育福利事业，都应当是为广大青年群众服务的，不宜强调会员的优先权，所以在章程草案中把原简章的第二章第五条丙项予以取消。又关于缴纳会费问题则在章程草案的第三章已提到。因此，现将原简章的第六条丙项亦删去。按照新的章程草案，会员的权利与义务，均合并在第一章第二条的甲、乙、丙、丁等四项中。
    四、关于会员违反本会章程宗旨的处理问题
    因原简章所定不十分完善，现改为“本会会员如有违反本会章程宗旨之行为者，经全国代表大会或全国委员会决议，得予以适当处置。”这样就可以照顾到各种不同情况，能够比较灵活地运用。
    五、关于本会处理日常工作的机构问题
    四年来青联的工作有很大发展，但全国青联的日常工作机构还很不健全，一切事务均由秘书处办理。在主席副主席之下，全国青联缺乏必要的分工负责的工作机构，因此不论兼职和专职的干部都嫌太少，以致许多应做的工作不能够很好地完成。去年在毛主席的关怀和指导下，对青联的方针任务有了明确的规定，今后工作更必须加强。为了把青联的工作切实地向前推进，加强总会的办事机构，已成为目前亟待解决的问题了。修改草案中第十条第十一条和第十二条就是为了解决这个迫切的问题而提出来的。
    六、关于经费问题
    根据几年来实际的情况，改为“经费来源为：会员团体之会费，和社会募捐”。
    章程的修改草案和以上的说明，是否妥当，谨请代表大会予以审议决定。（新华社）
