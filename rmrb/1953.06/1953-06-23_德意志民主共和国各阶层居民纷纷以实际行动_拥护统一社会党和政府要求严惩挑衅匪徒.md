Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, June 22nd: According to TASS, Berlin's democratic newspapers published many reports illustrating that residents of all strata in the German Democratic Republic and the democratic sector of Berlin are closely united around their government and the working-class party—the Socialist Unity Party of Germany. According to a "Neues Deutschland" reporter from Stalinstadt, workers at the Stalin Metallurgical Factory resolutely opposed the saboteurs and suppressed the fascist disturbances in the factory. They captured three saboteurs who attempted to incite workers to strike and handed them over to the People's Police. Construction workers in the city demanded the severest punishment for the saboteurs. The entire workforce of the "Pless" coal mine near Halle, despite all the sabotage, has been working together these days, thus completing the production plan for the first half of 1953 ahead of schedule. To this end, the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany sent a congratulatory telegram to the mine. The telegram said that the workers of this mine have proven by their labor achievements that they have great trust in the working-class party—the Socialist Unity Party of Germany—and the German Democratic Republic. "Neues Deutschland" wrote: Many working people in the German Democratic Republic are applying to join the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, proving their loyalty to their democratic system and their loyalty to the cause of the German working class. The "Bauern Echo," the organ of the Democratic Peasants' Party, wrote: The working people of the Republic are increasingly aware of the real reasons for the fascist adventurist actions. The newspaper emphasized that the peasants of the Republic, in many telegrams, letters, and statements, express their trust in the government of the Republic. They respond to the provocations and fascist bandits by intensifying their work. Many farmers in their statements demand the most severe punishment for the fascist provocateurs.

    【新华社二十二日讯】据塔斯社柏林二十一日讯：柏林民主报纸刊载许多消息，说明德意志民主共和国和柏林民主区各阶层居民紧密团结在自己的政府和工人阶级党——德国统一社会党的周围。据“新德意志报”记者自斯大林斯塔德报道，斯大林冶金工厂工人坚决反对捣乱分子，镇压了工厂里的法西斯分子骚动。他们捉住了三个企图煽动工人罢工的捣乱分子，交给人民警察。该城的建筑工人要求最严厉地惩罚捣乱分子。哈雷附近“普莱茨”石炭矿场的全体工人这些天来不顾一切捣乱，仍然是合力地工作着，因此，提前完成了一九五三年上半年的生产计划。为此，德国统一社会党中央委员会向该矿发去贺电。贺电说，这个矿的劳动者以自己的劳动成就证明自己是十分信任工人阶级党——德国统一社会党和德意志民主共和国的。“新德意志报”写道：德意志民主共和国许多劳动人民申请加入德国统一社会党，证明他们忠实于自己的民主制度，忠实于德国工人阶级的事业。民主农民党机关报“农民回声报”写道：共和国的劳动人民日益清楚地明白法西斯分子冒险行动的真正原因了。该报着重指出：共和国的农民在许多电报、信件和声明中表示他们信任共和国政府。他们以加强自己的工作来回答挑衅和法西斯匪徒。许多农民在声明中要求给予法西斯挑衅者最严厉的惩治。
