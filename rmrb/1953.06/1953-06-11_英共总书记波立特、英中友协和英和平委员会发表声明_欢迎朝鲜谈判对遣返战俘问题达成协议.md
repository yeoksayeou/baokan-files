Xinhua News Agency, Prague, June 10th: The London "Daily Worker" published a statement on the 9th by Harry Pollitt, General Secretary of the British Communist Party. In his statement, Pollitt welcomed the agreement reached at Panmunjom on the repatriation of prisoners of war, calling it a "new era in history." Pollitt said, "The news that an agreement has been reached in Korea on the prisoner of war issue has been greeted with joy everywhere. A heavy burden has been lifted from the hearts of millions of mothers, fathers, wives, loved ones, and children."

The statement also said, "This agreement was reached not only because some people have been negotiating for a long time, but also because of the tremendous pressure and desire of peace-loving people all over the world."

The Britain-China Friendship Association also issued a statement welcoming the agreement reached on the handling of the prisoner of war issue. The statement pointed out: "The road to an immediate ceasefire is now open."

The British Peace Committee said in its statement: After the armistice in Korea, broader negotiations must be held to achieve lasting world peace. The agreement reached in Korea will be warmly welcomed by people all over the world. After the agreement is signed, efforts must be made immediately to promote great power talks to resolve other pressing issues. The committee pointed out that the wars in Malaya, Indochina, and Kenya, the division of Germany, and China's exclusion from the United Nations must be resolved by great power talks. The committee urged strengthening activities, sending delegations to meet with members of parliament, and holding open-air rallies to promote the convening of this peace conference.

The "Daily Worker" reported that the British Electrical Trade Union, which met over the weekend, welcomed the news from Korea and "urgently called on the government to take the initiative to ensure that the armistice becomes the first step in resolving outstanding Far Eastern issues."
