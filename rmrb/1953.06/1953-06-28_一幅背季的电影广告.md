    An Out-of-Season Film Advertisement
    By our reporter Shen Wenying
    In mid-April, the weather in Changsha was already hot, and people were buying summer goods to change with the season. On the blackboards of private department stores, large characters proclaimed: "New arrival of summer goods in large quantities - shirts, undershirts, socks, mosquito nets, palm-leaf fans, welcome to visit and purchase," and so on. However, at the Ping'an Cinema in Changsha, the screen was showing an advertisement for winter goods such as sweaters, cotton socks, and snow cream every day. The audience was discussing this ridiculous advertisement: "Who placed this advertisement? Who would buy sweaters and cotton socks in this hot weather? It's a waste of advertising money!"
    The staff of the Changsha Department Store Purchasing and Supply Wholesale Station also saw this advertisement. Wang Songtao, a storekeeper, exposed this matter in the station's "Chang Gong Briefing." Everyone then inquired about it, asking the secretary, section chief, and deputy manager, but none of them knew about it. Later, they inquired with the Changsha Department Store, but the city store replied that they had not placed it. Since they couldn't find out which unit had placed it, they sent someone to the Ping'an Cinema to ask. The cinema replied that the Provincial Department Store had placed it and paid the fee monthly. Finally, they checked the advertising fee receipt book and found that the advertising fee was paid by the Changsha Department Store Purchasing and Supply Wholesale Station.
    Therefore, the Purchasing and Supply Wholesale Station investigated the matter. The course of events was as follows:
    In December of last year, the Hunan Provincial Department Store changed its organizational structure and separated its business units to establish the Purchasing and Supply Wholesale Station. At that time, it was decided that the business unit would be responsible for placing advertisements, that is, the Purchasing and Supply Wholesale Station would be responsible for paying the advertising fees to the two cinemas. Yan Zerei, the staff member of the Provincial Department Store in charge of placing advertisements, handed this matter over to the accountant of the general affairs section of the Purchasing and Supply Wholesale Station. The accountant of the general affairs section believed that the monthly expenses were not large, and with the consent of the person in charge of the accounting section of the finance and accounting department, the advertising fees were paid in full every month without going through the head of the finance and accounting department (the head of the business section was even less aware of it). However, no one cared about what advertisements were being shown. Therefore, although winter had long passed, the advertisement depicting sweaters and cotton socks was still meeting the audience on the screen every day.
    In fact, this situation also frequently occurs in the retail departments of some state-owned stores. The sample counters of private stores have long been arranged with seasonal goods, but the sample counters of some state-owned stores still display out-of-season goods - covered with a layer of dust. In mid-May, the large glass sample counters of the Changsha Department Store and Zhonghe Retail Department still displayed four wool vests and four pounds of coarse wool yarn.
    The season has changed, and the needs of residents have certainly changed, but some state-owned commercial workers have not seen this change. This out-of-season film advertisement not only wasted a lot of advertising money, as the audience said, but more seriously, it shows that the slogan "serve the consumers" has been forgotten by many commercial workers.

    一幅背季的电影广告
    本报记者　沈文英
    四月中旬，长沙市的天气已经很热，人们都要购买夏季用品来换季了。私营百货商店的黑板广告上，都写着：新到大批夏季用品——衬衫、汗衫、套袜、蚊帐、蒲扇，欢迎参观选购等大字。但长沙市平安电影院的银幕上，却天天放映着一幅宣传绒衫、棉毛袜、雪花膏等冬季用品的广告。观众纷纷谈论着这幅可笑的广告：是谁家登的广告？这大热天，谁要买绒衫、棉毛袜？真是糟蹋广告费！
    这幅广告也被长沙百货采购供应批发站的职工看到了。保管员王松涛就在该站“长供简报”上揭发了这件事；大家就来追问了这件事；问秘书，问科长，问副经理，他们都不知道这回事。后来就追问长沙市百货商店，市商店的答复是：没有登。既然查不到是那个单位登的，于是就派人到平安电影院去问。院方答复：是省百货公司登的，而且月月都付钱。最后去查广告费收据簿，原来广告费是长沙百货采购供应批发站付的。
    于是，就在采购供应批发站追究这件事。原来事情的经过是这样的：
    去年十二月份，湖南省百货公司改变组织机构，把业务机构分出，成立了采购供应批发站。当时决定刊登广告由业务机构负责，即由采购供应批发站负责付给两家电影院的广告费。省百货公司管理登广告的工作人员颜泽瑞，把这件事交代给采购供应批发站总务股的会计，总务股会计认为每月费用不多，征得财会科账务股负责人的同意，没有通过财会科长（业务科长更无法知道），就月月如数支付广告费；但究竟登了些什么广告，却没有人管。因此，冬季虽然早已过去，但画着绒衫、棉毛袜的广告，还天天在银幕上和观众会面。
    其实，某些国营商店的门市部中，也经常出现这种情形。私营商店的样柜里早已布置了应季的商品，但是有些国营商店的样柜里摆的还是过季的商品——上面还蒙着一层灰尘。长沙市百货商店中和门市部的大玻璃样柜里，在五月中旬依旧陈列着四件羊毛背心和四磅粗绒线。
    季节变了，居民需要当然也变了，但有些国营商业工作人员却没有看到这种变化。这幅背季的电影广告，不只是像观众们所说的糟蹋了许多广告费，更严重的是它表示：“为消费者服务”这个口号，竟被许多商业工作人员忘记了。
