Production Scheduling Work—An Important System for Implementing Planned Management

Luo Han, Acting Deputy Director of the General Dispatching Office of Anshan Iron and Steel Company

(1) What is Production Scheduling Work?

The operation plan is the central link in achieving planned management, and production scheduling work is an important system and method for implementing the operation plan. It continuously checks the production process and progress according to the operation plan, and adjusts the actions of various links in the enterprise to ensure that production can be carried out in a balanced and rhythmic manner. It centrally supervises the production process, removes various obstacles in the execution of the operation plan, and flexibly uses potential capabilities and resources to ensure the completion of the operation plan. Especially in large-scale continuous production industrial and mining enterprises, due to the complexity of the production process, the variety of raw materials and product specifications, and the close supply and demand relationship between various production units within the enterprise, production scheduling work is of greater significance.

Production scheduling work is one of the advanced production management methods in the Soviet Union. The resolution of the 18th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) in 1939 specifically emphasized the need to organize rhythmic and balanced production in enterprises. The resolution pointed out: "It is necessary to... eliminate unplanned and unbalanced product production, rush work phenomena in enterprise work, and strive to complete the production plan of each factory, mine, and railway every day according to pre-determined instruction charts." Scheduling work assumes the important mission of checking, supervising, and ensuring the completion of daily plans in "organizing rhythmic production according to instruction charts."

(2) Production Scheduling Organization System

Scheduling personnel have a fixed office location—the dispatching room. According to the continuity of production, the dispatching room is equipped with dispatchers on duty in three shifts day and night. Depending on the size of the factory and the complexity of the production process, assistant dispatchers can be added under the on-duty dispatcher if necessary. The general division of labor for scheduling personnel is: the chief dispatcher is in charge of overall business, the dispatcher handles problems that occur in production, and the assistant dispatcher is responsible for recording and filling out reports.

In Soviet industrial and mining enterprises, dispatchers are engineers, and assistant dispatchers are technicians. Scheduling personnel must first go to the relevant production departments for a relatively long period of study and understanding of the situation before they can officially participate in on-duty scheduling work.

The dispatching room of Anshan Iron and Steel Company is under the jurisdiction of the production department and is led by the production manager and the director of the production department. The dispatching room of the factory and mine is directly led by the factory and mine director or by the duty director according to its production situation. Due to the lack of technical personnel, in addition to a few technical personnel in the company's dispatching room, the dispatching personnel in the factory, mine or workshop are staffed by clerks, production management personnel, and workers with longer seniority.

(3) Procedures and Contents of Production Scheduling Work

Production scheduling work requires rapid and accurate handling of problems. Therefore, the relationship between the company, factory, mine, and workshop dispatching rooms must be linear. At the same time, close scheduling links should also be established between factories and mines, and between workshops. In this way, it can avoid untimely contact and reflection of the situation, and errors and deviations caused by too many levels.

Production scheduling work requires consistent coordination between superiors and subordinates. There should be a decisive solution to problems (of course, this solution should also be based on the opinions of all parties and should also be practical and feasible). Therefore, in production scheduling work, the principle of "unified command" is emphasized.

Due to the above requirements, the procedure of scheduling work is determined as follows: company dispatchers systematically supervise the production process of each factory and mine, and analyze the execution of the operation plan. If phenomena or defects that hinder normal production are found, the company dispatcher issues orders to the factories and mines through the on-duty dispatchers of the factories and mines to correct the deviations. The factory and mine dispatchers also issue instructions through the on-duty dispatchers of the workshops to correct defects and uncoordinated phenomena in production. The workshop dispatchers issue instructions to the foremen of each section through the on-duty foremen. At the same time, in addition to the company dispatcher issuing orders and measures to remedy and correct the uncoordinated phenomena between the relevant factories and mines, the factory and mine dispatchers can also contact each other.

The reflection of the production situation is exactly the opposite of the above procedure. That is, the section foreman must report the production situation to the workshop dispatcher within the prescribed time. The workshop dispatcher reports to the factory and mine dispatcher on time. The factory and mine dispatcher summarizes the situation of each workshop and then reports to the company dispatcher on time.

In short, the business content of scheduling work is to take all effective measures to ensure the realization of the operation plan. In order to achieve this goal, it is stipulated that the business of scheduling work must include:

1. Continuously check the completion of the operation plan. Scheduling personnel carry out the inspection of the production operation plan according to the day and night production instruction charts, using the above-mentioned method of reflecting the production situation at regular intervals.

2. Check the progress of work preparation and promptly prevent various uncoordinated phenomena that may occur. Before the start of each production cycle (such as the start of the refining of a certain specified steel grade by an open hearth furnace in a steelmaking plant, the start of rolling a certain specification of steel by a rolling mill, or the replacement of a certain generator or blower in a power plant), the scheduling personnel must check whether the production preparation work (including the supply of raw materials, the preparation of tools, the inspection of equipment, etc.) has been fully completed, and decide whether to carry out production or change the planned production, so as to avoid accidents due to insufficient preparation conditions after the start of production.

3. Timely discover various contradictions that occur in the implementation of the operation plan and take emergency measures to quickly resolve them. Because scheduling personnel constantly check the production situation, they can grasp the progress of the operation plan in any section in time, can find defects in production at any time, and can timely understand what factors are threatening the normal progress of production. If the operation plan may be completed ahead of schedule, the scheduling personnel should promptly issue instructions, check the preparation work at the beginning of the next production cycle, and take measures to ensure that the preparation work is completed ahead of schedule. If the operation plan cannot be completed on schedule, the scheduling personnel must consider the impact on the next production (such as considering steelmaking when ironmaking fails to complete the task, and primary rolling when steelmaking fails to complete the task), timely issue instructions, or change the operation plan, or use reserve raw materials to ensure that this impact is reduced to a minimum. At the same time, it is necessary to analyze the reasons for the failure to complete the operation plan and take various measures to make up for it.

4. When temporary problems occur with the day and night instruction charts, they should be resolved in a timely manner. For example, when a blast furnace is shut down urgently, the scheduling personnel must carry out the distribution and balance of fuel gas. If the rolling roll of a rolling mill breaks, spare parts should be contacted quickly.

(4) Production Scheduling Tools and Working System

In order to ensure the rapid, accurate, flexible, and agile nature of scheduling work, dedicated signaling and communication tools must be set up.

The dedicated telephone set up in the scheduling agency should meet three requirements: first, it should be able to talk to any smallest unit as much as possible; second, it should be able to talk to many units at the same time as much as possible; and third, the telephone can also be used as a broadcast to broadcast to the entire plant. The dedicated scheduling telephone of Anshan Iron and Steel can currently only meet the first and second requirements mentioned above, and improvements are still needed in the future.

In order to ensure that scheduling work can effectively check and urge production to be balanced and rhythmic, it is necessary to use instruction charts to grasp the production progress. From the comparison between the plan and the actual, it is easy to see the situation of completing production according to the plan. According to the instruction chart, scheduling personnel can analyze the production situation in a timely manner and find out what factors are threatening and affecting production.

The most important systems that must be possessed and established in the implementation of scheduling work are:

1. Responsibility system. All problems handled by scheduling personnel on duty, in addition to decisions made after requesting instructions from superiors, should be fully responsible by the scheduling personnel.

2. Shift handover system. Due to the continuity of production in industrial and mining enterprises, three shifts are required to operate uniformly. Therefore, strictly stipulating the shift handover system of scheduling work (including written and verbal explanations) is an important condition to ensure the consistency of handling daily production work and mutual non-contradiction.

3. Reporting system. In addition to the timed telephone reports of the production situation between the internal scheduling agencies, there should also be a system of reporting the production situation to the leadership at regular intervals. The content of the report includes the completion of the operation plan, the implementation of the plan, the comparison between the specifications of the planned production products and the actual production specifications, the accident situation, the maintenance situation, and the key problems existing in production. It is generally stipulated that the scheduling personnel must report to the leadership once or twice a day. The most important one is the morning shift report, that is, the night shift summarizes the production situation of the previous day (including the above items) and reports to the leadership.

In the scheduling work of Anshan Iron and Steel, in addition to the above three main systems, there are also fuel gas discipline system and power supply scheduling regulations and power load limit regulations to ensure the unified supply of power. The manager scheduling telephone reporting system is also a very important measure.

This system, like the production telephone conference implemented in Soviet industrial and mining enterprises, can ensure close contact between the company and factories and mines and timely inspection of the work of factory and mine leaders.

Another important system mastered by the Anshan Iron and Steel scheduling agency is the scheduling order system. When it is necessary to use unqualified raw materials in order not to affect production, the company's dispatching room can issue numbered dispatching orders and conduct reasonable payment through the technical supervision office inspection station. This system does not exist in Soviet industrial and mining enterprises, because Soviet industrial and mining enterprises strictly stipulate the grade of raw materials, and unqualified products are prohibited from being used.

(5) The Relationship Between Production Scheduling Work and Operation Plan

The main task of scheduling work is to implement and check the operation plan. The ultimate goal of the instruction chart mastered by the dispatching room is to ensure the realization of the operation plan. The main factors that determine the complexity or simplicity of the instruction chart are the complexity of the production process and enterprise organization, and the completeness of the operation plan. Generally speaking, it is easy to fill out the instruction chart, but it is difficult to grasp the instruction chart. The reason is that the operation plan and the instruction chart itself are things that change with the production situation. The key to determine whether the instruction chart is predictive mainly depends on the completeness of the instruction chart and the scheduling personnel's ability to analyze and judge the production situation. Therefore, it can be asserted that without scheduling organization and scheduling work, the execution of the enterprise operation plan will be hindered. When there is no scheduling organization, the implementation and inspection of the enterprise operation plan are the responsibility of the workshop director to check the execution of the workshop's day and night operation plan. The production technology section summarizes the situation of each workshop and makes an analysis report on the execution of the factory and mine's day and night operation plan. Because the heads of each workshop are busy with work and cannot contact the production technology section in a timely manner, and the production technology section is far away from the workshop, they only know the production situation of important sections and do not know the production situation of auxiliary sections. In particular, the person who executes the operation plan and the person who supervises the completion of the operation plan both belong to the workshop director, and the report may be biased and untrue, which has a great impact and loss on the completion of the operation plan.

Both the operation plan and the instruction chart change with the change of the production situation. Therefore, unless the potential capacity of an enterprise is very large, but the planned indicators are set very low, and production is stopped after completing the task according to the operation plan every day, then it can be guaranteed to complete the operation plan 100%. In addition, it is never possible to guarantee the completion of the plan 100%, no more and no less. Therefore, in the production process, the operation plan and the instruction chart are completely likely to be disrupted, and the scheduling work itself is to ensure the completion and over-completion of the operation plan, and it is by no means that production is stopped after completion. Therefore, when a new production record appears in a factory, the scheduling personnel should appropriately adjust the operation plan to ensure the supply of raw materials, power, and transportation. Sudden accidents and defects in production also disrupt the operation plan and the instruction chart. At this time, the responsibility of the scheduling personnel is to take emergency and effective measures, timely issue orders to modify the operation plan, or to find ways to continue to maintain the operation plan according to the progress.

(6) Several Issues Related to Production Scheduling Work

1. What kind of factories should or should not establish scheduling organizations? Usually, under two circumstances, a production scheduling organization should be established. One is that there are several workshops in the factory that rely on each other and cannot be separated. If one workshop fails to complete the task, it will directly affect other workshops. In this case, a scheduling organization should be established even if the factory is not large. The other is that there are not many products, only one or two kinds, but the factory is large and the output is high, so the supply of raw materials and the amount of transportation are large. In order to ensure the normal progress of the production of the entire factory, it is also important to establish a production scheduling organization.

In small factories, there are only one or two kinds of products and the production process is simple, so it is not necessary to establish a production scheduling organization. The business content of production scheduling can be mastered by the production technology section. If it is continuous production, a shift system should be adopted to ensure that the main person in charge is in charge of the production work of the entire factory day and night.

2. What should I do if the command of the company's dispatching room conflicts with the command of the factory and mine leaders? The answer is that the command of the company's dispatching room should still be obeyed, because the command issued by the factory and mine director is based on the production perspective of a factory and mine under his leadership, and sometimes it cannot take care of the overall production. Therefore, the factory and mine scheduling personnel should still take the company's dispatching room's command as the principle of implementing the work.

At the same time, it should also be pointed out that unified scheduling command does not mean blind obedience. When the command issued by the company's dispatching room is really unworkable, or the analysis and estimate of the on-site situation are insufficient, and the command does not meet the development of the actual production situation, the factory and mine scheduling personnel can put forward specific reasons and require the company's dispatching room to withdraw the command. The company's dispatching room should consider these opinions and decide whether to change the command. If the original command is still insisted, the factory and mine scheduling must still obey.

If any behavior of resisting the command is found in the scheduling command, it should be dealt with as a violation of law and discipline. Soviet experts told us that whoever disobeys the scheduling command will be severely punished.

3. How to establish scheduling prestige? It mainly depends on the strong support of the leadership and the scheduling personnel's actual solution to the problems for the site. The development process of the scheduling work of the Anshan Iron and Steel Chemical Plant can well illustrate this problem.

When the Anshan Iron and Steel Chemical Plant just established a scheduling organization, the leadership attached great importance to it and supported it, stipulating a set of systems, emphasizing that the person in charge of each workshop on duty must report the production situation to the scheduling room in a timely manner, and the start and stop of important equipment such as coal washing machines and blowers must be approved by the scheduling room, and those who violate it will be treated as dereliction of duty. At the same time, the dispatchers of the Chemical Plant can often go deep into the workshop, study business, and work with the workers. One day in 1951, the high-voltage line of the blower power supply turned red, and the blower was in danger of stopping. At that time, it was too late to find the factory director and engineer. After reporting to the dispatching room, the scheduling personnel analyzed the situation and timely instructed the ammonium sulfate workshop to stop the operation of the ammonia water pump and the clear water pump, so that the phenomenon of red high-voltage lines turned to缓和, and then found the factory director and engineer to study and solve the problem, avoiding the loss caused by the release of fuel gas and affecting the production of each using unit. The on-site workers unanimously reflected: "The dispatching room can solve the problem. If anything happens in the future, find the dispatching room." Soon after, the coal washing workshop violated the operating procedures and tripped all the switches of the three power distribution rooms. The chemical scheduling room timely instructed the electricians to carry out emergency repairs, shortening the downtime. The workers knew and said: "Don't look at them as clerks, they also understand production technology." Because the chemical scheduling room solved the problems for the site in a timely manner, it rarely encountered obstacles or behaviors of violating the scheduling command when commanding production.

4. What are the basic conditions for scheduling personnel?

(1) Be familiar with the entire production process, equipment capacity, and raw material reserves within the scope of your scheduling.

(2) Be familiar with the various measures, allocation, quantity, and progress schedule in the operation plan.

(3) Be familiar with the general technical operation regulations and important company orders and systems.

(4) Understand the general production process of the relevant units and the supply and demand relationship and quantity between them and this factory.

(5) Correctly grasp the allocation of power resources, be familiar with the relationship between transportation routes, fuel gas pipelines, water, and electricity, and the source and usage of fuel gas pipelines, water, and electricity.

(6) Loyalty and honesty are the most basic conditions for scheduling personnel.

(7) Conclusion

In industrial and mining enterprises, whether the production scheduling work and organization are sound determines whether the operation plan can be implemented. At the same time, in the process of implementing production scheduling, it is possible to timely discover the shortcomings in the preparation of the operation plan and the contradictions with the actual production on the site. Therefore, scheduling work can also check and criticize the accuracy of the preparation of the operation plan and whether the comprehensive situation is considered. More importantly, through scheduling business work, it is possible to train and cultivate comprehensive talents. Because if scheduling work does not have a global perspective, it cannot complete the task well. Production scheduling work is still a new production management method in the industrial and mining enterprises of our country. How to do this work well remains to be studied and improved by comrades in various industrial and mining enterprises.

    生产调度工作—实现计划管理的重要制度
    鞍山钢铁公司总调度室代理副主任  罗汉
      （一）什么是生产调度工作
    作业计划是实现计划管理的中心环节，生产调度工作则是贯彻作业计划的重要制度和方法。它按照作业计划，连续检查生产过程及进度，调节企业中各个环节的动作，以保证生产能够均衡地有节奏地进行。它对生产过程进行集中的监督，清除作业计划执行中的各种阻碍，机动地使用潜在能力与资源，以保证作业计划的完成。特别是在大规模的连续生产的工矿企业中，由于生产过程复杂，原材料及产品规格种类繁多，企业内部各生产单位供求关系密切，因此，生产调度工作就有更重要的意义。
    生产调度工作，是苏联先进的生产管理方法之一。一九三九年联共（布）第十八次党代表大会决议上，曾特别强调要在企业中组织有节奏的和均衡的生产。决议中指出：“必须……杜绝无计划性、不均衡性的产品生产、在企业工作上的突击现象，并力求每天按预先制订的指示图表完成每个工厂、矿山和铁路的生产计划”。而调度工作在“按指示图表组织有节奏的生产”中，负着检查、监督与保证完成日计划的重要使命。
      （二）生产调度组织系统
    调度人员有固定的办公地点——调度室。根据生产的连续性，调度室配备有日夜三班轮值的调度员。根据工厂规模的大小及生产过程的繁简，值班调度员之下，必要时可增设助理调度员。调度人员一般的分工是：总调度长掌握全面业务，调度员处理生产中发生的问题，助理调度员负责记录及填写表报。
    苏联工矿企业中的调度员，由工程师担任，助理调度员则由技术员担任。调度人员首先必须到各有关生产部门进行一段较长时期的学习与了解情况，才能正式参预值班调度工作。
    鞍山钢铁公司的调度室隶属于生产处，由生产经理及生产处长领导。厂矿调度室根据其生产情况由厂矿长直接领导或由值班主任领导的。调度人员的配备因技术人员不够，除了公司调度室有几名技术人员以外，厂矿或车间调度人员则由职员、生产管理人员、工龄较长的工人等担任。
      （三）生产调度工作的程序及内容
    生产调度工作要求迅速准确地处理问题。因此，公司、厂矿、车间调度室的关系必须是直线的，同时，也应该在各厂矿之间，各车间之间密切调度联系。这样，就可以避免联络及反映情况不及时，和因层次过多而发生错误和偏差。
    生产调度工作要求上下协调一致。处理问题，应该有一个果断的办法（当然，这个办法也应该是结合各方面的意见得出的，同时也是切实可行的）因此，在生产调度工作中，就强调“统一命令”的原则。
    由于以上要求，调度工作的程序就决定为：公司调度员有系统地监督各厂矿的生产过程，分析作业计划执行情况。如果发现有碍正常生产的现象或缺陷，则通过厂矿调度值班人员，向厂矿发出命令，纠正偏差。厂矿调度员同样通过车间值班调度员发出指示，纠正生产中的缺陷和不协调现象。而车间调度员，则通过值班工长，对各工段工长发布指示。同时，有关厂矿之间的不协调现象，除了由公司调度员发布命令和措施予以补救纠正以外，厂矿调度员相互也可以进行联络。
    有关生产情况的反映，就恰恰和上述的程序相反。即工段工长必须在规定时间以内将生产情况报告车间调度员。车间调度员按时报告厂矿调度员。厂矿调度员综合各车间情况后，再按时报告公司调度员。
    调度工作的业务内容，简言之，就是采取一切有效措施，保证作业计划的实现。为了要达到这一目的，就规定了调度工作的业务必须包括：
    1、连续检查作业计划的完成情况。调度人员按照昼夜生产指示图表，运用上述的定时反映生产情况的方法，进行生产作业计划的检查工作。
    2、检查作业准备工作的进度，及时地预防可能发生的各种不协调现象。调度人员在每一生产周期开始之前（如炼钢厂平炉开始炼制某一炉规定钢种的钢水，如轧钢厂开始轧制某一种规格的钢材，如发电厂换用某号发电机或鼓风机），要检查生产准备工作（包括原料的供应、工具的准备、设备的检查等）是否全部完成，决定是否进行生产或变更计划生产，以避免在开始生产以后因准备条件不够而发生事故。
    3、及时发现执行作业计划中所发生的各种矛盾，采取紧急措施迅速予以解决。由于调度人员经常不断检查生产情况，因而，他就可以及时掌握作业计划在任何工段完成进度的情况，可以随时发现生产当中的缺陷，可以及时了解什么因素在威胁着生产的正常进行。如作业计划可能提前完成，调度人员则应及时发布指示，检查下一次生产周期开始时的准备工作，并采取措施保证准备工作提前完成。如作业计划不能如期完成，调度人员则必须考虑对下一生产的影响情况（如炼铁完不成计划任务时考虑炼钢，炼钢完不成计划任务时考虑初轧），及时发布指示，或变更作业计划，或动用贮备原料，以保证使这种影响减低至最小程度。同时要分析完不成作业计划的原因，采取各种措施予以弥补。
    4、昼夜指示图表发生临时性的问题时，要及时解决。如高炉紧急休风时，调度人员要进行燃气的分配平衡。如轧钢机轧滚折断时，应迅速联系备品。
    （四）生产调度工具与工作制度
     为了保证调度工作的迅速准确、机动灵活，必须设置专用的信号及通讯工具。
    调度机构内设置的专用电话，要满足三个要求：一是尽可能地与任何一个最小单位通话，一是尽可能在同一时间中与许多单位通话，再就是电话机也可以用作广播，对全厂广播。鞍钢的专用调度电话，目前还只能做到上述的第一、第二个要求，以后还待改进。
    为了保证调度工作能有效地检查与督促生产均衡和有节奏地进行，必须利用指示图表掌握生产进度。从计划与实际的比较中，就很容易看得出来按计划完成生产的情况。根据指示图表，调度人员可以及时地进行生产情况的分析，发现究竟是什么因素威胁和影响着生产。
    在执行调度工作中所必需具备和建立的制度，最主要的是：
    1、责任制度。调度人员在值班时所处理的一切问题，除了请示上级作出的决定以外，应完全由调度人员负责。
    2、交接班制度。由于工矿企业生产的连续性要求三班统一操作。因此，严格地规定调度工作的交接班制度（包括书面、口头交代）是保证处理日常生产工作前后一致、互不矛盾的重要条件。
    3、汇报制度。除了调度机构内部相互之间的定时通话汇报生产情况之外，还应该有定时向领导上汇报生产情况的制度。汇报的内容包括完成作业计划情况、执行计划情况、计划生产产品的规格与实际生产规格的比较、事故情况、检修情况，以及生产中存在的关键问题等项目。一般规定每日调度人员均须向领导上汇报一次或两次。最主要的一次是早班汇报，即由夜班总结先一日的生产情况（包括上述项目），向领导汇报。
    在鞍钢的调度工作中，除了上述三种主要制度
    以外，还有燃气纪律制度和供电调度规程及电力负荷限制规定等制度，用来保证动力的统一供应。经理调度电话汇报制度，也是一个十分重要的措施。
    这个制度正如同苏联工矿企业中执行的生产电话会议一样，能保证公司与厂矿之间的密切联系和及时检查厂矿领导的工作。
       鞍钢调度机构掌握的另一个重要的制度，是调度命令制度。在必要时为了不影响生产，必须使用不合格的原材料时，公司调度室可以发布编号的调度命令，通过技术监督处检查站进行合理的支付。这个制度在苏联的工矿企业中是不存在的，因为苏联工矿企业中严格地规定了原料等级，不合格品是禁止使用的。
      （五）生产调度工作与作业计划的关系
    调度工作的主要任务是贯彻与检查作业计划。调度室掌握的指示图表，最终目的就是保证作业计划的实现。而决定指示图表的复杂或简单的主要因素，是生产过程和企业组织机构的繁简，以及作业计划的完整程度。一般说，填写指示图表容易，掌握指示图表困难。原因是作业计划和指示图表本身是一个随着生产情况而变化的东西。决定指示图表是否有预见性，主要是倚靠指示图表的完整程度，和调度人员对生产情况的分析和判断能力。因此，可以肯定说：没有调度组织和调度工作，企业作业计划的执行，是会受到阻碍的。在没有调度组织时，企业作业计划的贯彻与检查是车间主任负责检查车间昼夜作业计划执行情况，生产技术科综合各车间情况，作全厂矿昼夜作业计划执行分析报告。由于车间各负责人工作忙，不能及时与生产技术科联络，生产技术科远离车间，只知道重要工段的生产情况，不知道辅助工段的生产情况，特别是执行作业计划与监督作业计划完成者同属车间主任，可能报告有偏差不确实，这样就对作业计划的完成有着莫大的影响和损失。
    作业计划和指示图表都随着生产情况的变化而变化。因此，除非某个企业的潜在能力很大，计划指标却规定得很低，每天按作业计划完成任务以后就不生产了，这样便可以保证百分之百地完成作业计划。此外，决不会有经常保证百分之百、不多不少地完成计划的可能。因此，在生产过程中，作业计划和指示图表是完全有可能被打乱的，而调度工作的本身，是为了保证作业计划的完成和超额完成，决不是完成了便不生产了。因此，当某厂出现了新的生产纪录时，调度人员应适当调整作业计划以保证原材料、动力、运输的供应。生产中突发的事故和缺陷，也使作业计划和指示图表被打乱。这时，调度人员的责任则是采取紧急有效的措施，及时发布修改作业计划的命令，或是寻觅可以继续维持作业计划按进度进行的办法。
       （六）有关生产调度工作中的几个问题
    1、什么样的工厂应该或不应该建立调度组织机构？通常在两种情况之下，应该建立生产调度机构。一种是厂内有几个车间相互倚靠，不可分离，若有一个车间完不成任务，便会直接影响到其他车间，在这种情况之下，工厂不大也应建立调度机构。另外一种是产品不多，仅一两种，但是工厂大，产量高，因此原材料供应及运输量大。为了保证全厂生产的正常进行，建立生产调度机构也很重要。
    在小型的工厂中，产品仅一、二种，生产过程简单，可以不必建立生产调度机构，生产调度的业务内容，可交由生产技术科掌握。如系连续生产，则应该采取轮流值班制，使日夜都有主要负责人掌握全厂生产工作。
    2、公司调度室的指挥命令与厂矿领导干部的命令相矛盾时怎么办？答复是仍应该服从公司调度室命令，因为厂矿长发布的命令是从他领导的一个厂矿的生产角度出发的，有时不能照顾到全局生产，因此，厂矿调度人员仍应以公司调度室的命令为执行工作的原则。
    同时也应该指出一点，统一调度命令并不等于盲目服从。当公司调度室发布的命令确实行不通，或者是对现场情况分析和估计不足，命令不切合实际生产情况的发展；此时，厂矿调度人员可以提出具体理由，要求公司调度室撤回命令。公司调度室应考虑这些意见，决定是否更改命令。如仍坚持原令，厂矿调度仍得服从。
    调度命令中如发现对抗命令的行为，应以违法乱纪过失论处。苏联专家告诉我们说：谁不服从调度命令，谁就要受到严格的处分。
    3、如何树立调度威信？主要倚靠领导方面的大力支持和调度人员实际为现场解决问题。从鞍钢化工总厂调度工作的开展过程，可以很好地说明这个问题。
    鞍钢化工总厂刚建立调度组织时，领导方面就予以极大的重视和支持，规定出一套制度，强调指出各车间值班负责人一定要及时将生产情况汇报调度室，重要设备如洗煤机、鼓风机的停开，都必须取得调度室同意，违者以失职论处。同时，化工总厂的调度员，能经常深入车间，钻研业务，与工人打成一片。一九五一年有一天夜晚，鼓风机电源高压线烧红，鼓风机有停止运转的危险。当时现场已来不及找厂长及工程师，报告给调度室后，调度人员分析情况，及时指示硫安车间停止氨水泵与清水泵的运转，使高压线路发红的现象转趋和缓，再找厂长和工程师来研究解决问题，避免了因燃气放散，影响各使用单位的生产所造成的损失，现场工人一致反映说：“调度室能解决问题，以后有事要找调度室”。随后不久，洗煤车间因违犯操作规程，将三个配电室的开关都顶掉了，化工调度室及时指示电工进行抢修，缩短了停机时间，工人们知道了说：“别看他们是职员，生产技术也懂得。”由于化工调度室及时为现场解决了问题，因此在指挥生产时就很少遇到阻碍或违抗调度命令的行为。
      4、调度人员的基本条件有哪些
    （1）要熟悉所属调度范围内的全部生产过程、设备能力、原材料贮备情况。
    （2）要熟悉作业计划中的各项措施、分配、数量及进度日程。
    （3）要了解一般技术操作的规定及有关公司重要的命令制度。
    （4）要了解有关单位的一般生产过程及与本厂相互间的供求关系和数量。
    （5）要正确地掌握动力资源的分配，熟悉运输线路、燃气管道、水、电的交错关系及来源和使用量。
    （6）忠诚老实是调度人员最基本的条件。
    （七）结语
    在工矿企业中，生产调度工作和组织是否健全，决定了作业计划能否贯彻实现。同时，在执行生产调度过程中，可以及时发现作业计划编制上的缺点及与现场实际生产上所产生的矛盾，因此，调度工作也可以检查和批判作业计划编制的准确度和是否考虑全面情况。更重要的是通过调度业务工作，可以训练和培养全面性的人材。因为，调度工作如果没有全局观点，就不能很好地完成任务。生产调度工作在我们国家的工矿企业中，还是一种新的生产管理方法，如何作好这项工作，还有待各工矿、企业的同志们共同研究和改进。
