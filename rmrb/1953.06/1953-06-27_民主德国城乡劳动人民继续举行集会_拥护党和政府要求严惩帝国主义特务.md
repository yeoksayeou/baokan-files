(Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, June 26th) According to TASS, Berlin: The laboring people of the German Democratic Republic unanimously condemn the provocative acts of the fascist elements and express their trust and support for the Socialist Unity Party and the Republic's government.

	On June 24th, thousands of young German men and women in Berlin held a large-scale youth rally to express their support for and trust in the Party and the government. Kimmel, the first secretary of the Berlin branch of the Free German Youth League, condemned the fascist provocations of imperialist agents in Berlin and, on behalf of all young men and women in the German Democratic Republic, expressed their willingness to support and implement all the new measures of the government, because the government is implementing these measures for the benefit of the people and for the sake of peace and German unification. The rally passed a telegram to Otto Grotewohl, Prime Minister of the German Democratic Republic. The telegram stated that the young men and women gathered at the Seneferlde Square in Berlin expressed their love and trust in the government of the German Democratic Republic. The youth of Berlin despised the conspiracies of fascist agitators. They will do their best to expose the bandits, and they demand severe punishment for the bandits.

	In towns and villages throughout the German Democratic Republic, speakers at rallies held by the laboring people unanimously condemned the criminal conspiracies of the fascist provocateurs and expressed their full trust in the Central Committee of the German Socialist Unity Party and the government. In many parts of the Republic, people said that never in German history has there been a government that honestly and openly admitted its mistakes and immediately taken measures to correct them. The laboring people said at the meetings that because the government of the German Democratic Republic is a veritable people's government, it defends the interests of the people and is closely integrated with the people, so it can openly and bravely admit its shortcomings, not conceal the truth from the masses, and can correct these shortcomings in practice.

	The Council of Ministers of the German Democratic Republic is constantly receiving letters and telegrams from representatives of all sectors of the people and public organizations expressing their support and trust.

	Professor Liebknecht, President of the Academy of Building, and Vice President Klein, on behalf of all the staff of the Academy, expressed their support for the government's measures and assured the Prime Minister that they would improve their work. The Social Democratic Party representatives in the People's Chamber and the Senate of the German Democratic Republic in Berlin expressed their unlimited trust in the government's policies to Prime Minister Grotewohl. Daussent Smalfoss from Rittersgrün expressed the views of a large part of the German intellectual community. He wrote to Grotewohl, saying that he was willing to work hard to reach an agreement between the Germans. A railway worker in Torgau wrote: "The policies of our government are the policies of a truly people's government."

	Workers at the Abus factory in the Auvert Special Zone telegraphed Grotewohl, Prime Minister of the German Democratic Republic and Chairman of the Central Committee of the German Socialist Unity Party, saying that they would guarantee to complete 110% of the June plan. Workers at the Treptow Ifa factory in Berlin pledged to work two shifts to make up for lost time.

	To express their willingness to actively help the government of the German Democratic Republic and the Socialist Unity Party eliminate the consequences of this fascist adventure, workers in some Berlin factories have applied to join the German Socialist Unity Party.
