Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, June 5th. Workers, technicians, and staff of the Ilyich Light Bulb Factory in Moscow, the State-Run First Ball Bearing Factory, the Moscow Wire Factory, and the Electrical Equipment Factory have initiated a socialist competition to save metal consumption. They have pledged to save 1,500 tons of iron and 600 tons of non-ferrous metals this year. The employees of these factories have accumulated a great deal of experience in this area and have achieved great results. The Moscow Wire Factory made its first summary of savings achievements on the 3rd. The factory saved 170 tons of lead in May alone, which is 52 tons more than in April. In five months, the factory employees have put forward a total of 385 rationalization proposals, many of which are related to saving copper, lead, and other metals. After adopting some of the suggestions, 3 million rubles have been saved. The factory's experience shows that one of the most important ways to save metal is to improve the organization of labor and production and to improve technical procedures. The initiatives of these factories have been supported by the Moscow Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and are now being promoted to the Moscow Dynamo Factory, the Kalinin Pump Factory, the "Red Proletarian" Factory, the "Moskvich" small car factory, as well as transportation and construction enterprises.

    发起节省金属消耗的竞赛取得很大成绩
    【新华社莫斯科五日电】莫斯科伊里奇电灯泡制造厂、国营第一球轴承制造厂、莫斯科电线工厂和电气设备工厂的工人、技术人员和职员们，发起了节省金属消耗的社会主义竞赛。他们提出保证，要在今年节约一千五百吨铁和六百吨有色金属。这几个工厂的职工已在这方面积累了很多的经验，并获得了很大的成绩。莫斯科电线工厂在三日第一次总结了节约的成绩。该厂五月份仅铅一项就节约了一百七十吨，比四月份多节约了五十二吨。在五个月中，该厂职工共提出了三百八十五项合理化建议，其中有许多是关于节约铜、铅及其他金属的建议。一部分建议采用后，已节约了三百万卢布。工厂的经验表明，节约金属的最主要办法之一，就是改进劳动和生产的组织，改善技术手续。这些工厂的创议已得到了苏联共产党莫斯科市委员会的支持，现正推广到莫斯科狄纳莫工厂、加里宁抽水机工厂、“红色无产者”工厂、“莫斯科人”小型汽车工厂，以及运输业、建筑业各企业中去。
