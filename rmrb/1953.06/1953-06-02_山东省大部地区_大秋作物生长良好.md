Most areas of Shandong Province
    Good Growth of Autumn Crops
    Shandong Province's autumn crops are growing well, and the broad masses of farmers are working hard to thin seedlings and weed.
    Shandong Province's autumn crops such as sorghum, millet, and cotton were sown by the end of April. Because the broad masses of farmers carried out deep plowing and multiple harrowing during spring plowing, increased the amount of fertilizer applied compared to previous years, and implemented warm water soaking and chemical dressing of seeds, coupled with widespread heavy rains across the province in early and mid-May, the seedlings are growing vigorously in most areas except for individual areas affected by drought, pests, and hail disasters that resulted in missing seedlings. Currently, sorghum seedlings in areas such as Liaocheng, Linyi, Tengxian, Huxi, and Yishui Prefectures have grown to three or four inches in height, and cotton plants have sprouted four or five young leaves. The broad masses of farmers are working hard to thin seedlings and weed. Thinning and weeding have entered an intense phase in areas such as Huxi, Wendeng, Jiaozhou, Yishui, and Liaocheng Prefectures, where 30% to 80% of the sorghum, millet, and cotton have been weeded. Areas where seedling emergence is incomplete due to disasters are intensively carrying out seedling inspection and replanting. (Xinhua News Agency)

    山东省大部地区
    大秋作物生长良好
    山东省大秋作物生长良好，广大农民正紧张进行间苗、锄草。
    山东省高粱、谷子、棉花等大秋作物，在四月底即播种完毕。由于广大农民在春耕时做到了深耕多耙，比往年增加了施肥量，实行了温汤浸种和药剂拌种，加以五月上旬和中旬全省普降透雨，全省除个别地区因受旱、虫、雹灾缺苗外，大部地区禾苗生长旺盛。目前聊城、临沂、滕县、湖西、沂水等专区的高粱苗已长到三四寸高，棉花长出四五个嫩叶。广大农民正紧张进行间苗、锄草。湖西、文登、胶州、沂水、聊城等专区间苗、锄草已进入紧张阶段，这些地区的高粱、谷子、棉花已锄完百分之三十到八十。因受灾出苗不全的地区，正紧张地进行查苗补苗。    （新华社）
