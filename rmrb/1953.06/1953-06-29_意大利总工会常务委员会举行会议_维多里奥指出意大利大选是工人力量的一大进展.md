Xinhua News Agency, Rome, June 26th: According to TASS reports, the Standing Committee of the Italian General Confederation of Labor recently held a meeting. The General Secretary of the General Confederation of Labor, Giuseppe Vittorio, delivered a report at the meeting.

According to "Unità," Vittorio emphasized that the June 7th election was a major advance for the power of the workers and a complete failure of the reactionary "Atlantic policy." It not only declared the failure of the anti-democratic election "reform," but also the failure of the entire reactionary policy that relied on this "reform."

Vittorio continued, June 7th was also a victory for the program of economic development and social reform proposed by the Italian General Confederation of Labor, and a victory for the unity of the working class and the alliance with the middle class. The parties that included the demands of the Italian General Confederation of Labor in their political platforms received a total of ten million votes. Precisely because of this, the General Confederation of Labor demands that the new parliament take the necessary measures to meet the demands of so many voters, namely, to reform national life, especially to end the cold war waged by the government and employers against the working people, to end discrimination in politics and trade unions, and to stop the layoffs and suppression of workers.

The Italian General Confederation of Labor will not only strive for an immediate increase in the wages of working people in various sectors, but also strive to develop production, industrialize the South, mechanize agriculture, expand the domestic market, expand trade with various countries, and strive to eliminate unemployment.

The Italian General Confederation of Labor will support all other democratic organizations in order to contribute to a genuine and complete easing of international tensions. To this end, the General Confederation will redouble its efforts to seek broader united action with working people.

In his concluding remarks, Vittorio summarized the demands generated after the parliamentary elections into four points, and pointed out that the Italian General Confederation of Labor is determined to defend these four demands:

One, to fairly distribute national income by raising wages, pensions, subsidies, and social insurance; to reform the tax system so that the burden of taxation falls on capitalists and landlords, not on working people and the middle class.

Two, to immediately and completely stop the autocratic and suppressive actions against industrial workers and step up the effort to pass a labor law.

Three, to have Italy participate in various worldwide undertakings aimed at easing international tensions and resolving all disputes.

Four, to adopt a new economic policy and foreign trade policy to increase production and consumption, and to refuse to submit slavishly to foreign monopoly capital.

    意大利总工会常务委员会举行会议
    维多里奥指出意大利大选是工人力量的一大进展
    【新华社二十八日讯】据塔斯社罗马二十六日讯：意大利总工会常务委员会最近举行了一次会议。总工会总书记朱塞佩·维多里奥在会上作了报告。
    据“团结报”报道，维多里奥强调说，六月七日的选举是工人力量的一大进展，也是反动的“大西洋政策”的彻底失败。它不但宣告了反民主选举“改革”的失败，也宣告以这“改革”为依靠的整个反动政策的失败。
    维多里奥继续说道，六月七日也是意大利总工会提出的经济发展和社会改革纲领的一个胜利，是工人阶级团结一致及与中等阶级联盟的一个胜利。那些把意大利总工会的要求列入它们的政纲里的政党共得了一千万票。正是因为这样，总工会要求新议会采取必要措施去满足那么多选民的要求，就是革新国家生活、特别是结束政府和雇主对劳动人民进行的冷战、结束在政治和工会方面的歧视、并停止解雇和镇压工人。
    意大利总工会不但要争取立刻增加各部门劳动人民的工资，也要努力争取发展生产、使南方工业化、使农业机械化、扩大国内市场、扩展与各国间的贸易、努力消灭失业。
    意大利总工会将支持所有其他的民主组织，以便对真正地完全缓和国际紧张局势有所贡献，为这目的，总工会将加倍努力谋取与劳动人民更广泛的一致行动。
    维多里奥在总结发言中把议会选举后所产生的要求总结为四点，并指出意大利总工会决心保卫这四点要求：
    一、公平地分配国民收入，办法是，提高工资、养老金、补助金和社会保险金；改革税制，以便把纳税的负担放在资本家和地主身上，而不是放在劳动人民和中等阶级的身上；
    二、立刻完全停止对产业工人的专制与镇压行动，加紧争取通过一个劳动法；
    三、使意大利参加目的在于缓和国际紧张局势和解决所有纷争的各种世界性的事业；
    四、采取一个新的经济政策和对外贸易政策，以提高生产与消费，拒绝奴颜婢膝地向外国垄断资本屈服。
