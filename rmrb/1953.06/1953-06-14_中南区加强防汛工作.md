    Xinhua News Agency Report: Recently, there has been heavy rainfall in areas south of the Yangtze River in the Central South Region. Rivers in the Pearl River, Poyang Lake, and Dongting Lake systems have continuously experienced flood peaks. Dikes and embankments along the Pearl River, Gan River, and Fu River have been experiencing frequent emergencies. To this end, the Central South Region Flood Prevention, Drought Prevention, and Drought Resistance Production Joint Headquarters issued instructions to various localities on the 10th, requiring the rapid establishment and improvement of flood prevention organizations at all levels. Those that have not yet established flood prevention headquarters must do so in a timely manner, and those that have already been established should assign dedicated personnel to be responsible, mobilizing and organizing all possible forces to be ready to cope with flood attacks at any time, and to "be prepared, just in case," in order to overcome floods and ensure a good harvest. The instructions called on governments at all levels to seize the time to conduct a general inspection of dikes, flood prevention organizations, and flood prevention materials, etc., to raise the flood prevention vigilance of the masses and cadres. The instructions also required all localities to prevent the occurrence of drought after the floods at the same time, so as to prevent both floods and droughts.

    中南区加强防汛工作
    据新华社讯：中南区长江以南各地最近多雨，珠江、鄱阳湖水系和洞庭湖水系等各河流，都连续产生洪峰，珠江、赣江和抚河堤圩，曾不断发生险情。为此，中南区防汛防旱抗旱生产联合总指挥部于十日指示各地，要求迅速建立和健全各级防汛机构；尚未成立防汛指挥部的，必须及时成立，已成立的应派专人负责，动员和组织一切可能的力量，随时准备应付洪水的袭击，作到“有备无患”，以便战胜洪水，保证丰收。指示中号召各级政府抓紧时间普遍进行一次查堤、查防汛组织，查防汛器材等工作，以提高群众和干部的防汛警惕。指示也要求各地同时预防水灾后的旱象产生，做到防洪防旱两不误。
