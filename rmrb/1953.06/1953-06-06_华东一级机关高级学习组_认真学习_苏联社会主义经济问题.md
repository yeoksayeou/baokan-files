    The Senior Study Group of First-Level Organs in East China is continuing its study of "The Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR." This study will conclude in mid-June, and an examination system will be uniformly implemented. In recent studies, the general trend has been to overcome past biases such as not reading carefully, not thinking and researching problems independently, and being satisfied with superficial and seemingly enthusiastic but actually unprepared and uncentered small group discussions, thereby guiding the study onto a more normal path.

    Recently, based on conscientious self-study, and after researching the basic economic laws of socialism and capitalism, each group, in connection with the current economic situation in China, raised questions such as "What is the role and scope of activity of the law of value in the Chinese economy?"

    Comrade Chen Yi personally reviewed the many questions raised by the groups, and after the study office of the East China Bureau Propaganda Department collated and summarized them, they were distributed to each senior study group. Each comrade participating in the senior group study was required to think independently about each question, read relevant reference materials for research, and engage in mutual assistance discussions (but without holding unprepared full group discussions), so as to have their own preliminary and independent views on these questions. At the same time, in order to prepare answers to the questions and further promote the study, a symposium of the theoretical study advisory group of East China's first-level organs cadres was held under the personal chairmanship of Comrade Chen Yi, discussing several key issues among the many questions raised by the groups. Comrade Tan Zhenlin personally drafted a research outline on the study of new democratic economic issues in our country, guiding the study consultants to conduct research.

    Driven by the spirit of responsible comrades of the East China Bureau personally helping to solve the difficult problems in the study, the studies of each senior group have been further developed. Many units, based on independent thinking and research, and in conjunction with their own learning progress, conducted discussions and talks. For example, the senior groups of the East China Cultural and Educational Committee, the East China Bureau United Front Work Department, the East China Branch of the People's Bank of China, and Fudan University discussed issues such as whether economic laws have purposefulness and whether they have class character. Units such as the East China Grain Bureau discussed the relationship between economic laws and economic policies and economic plans. Units such as the East China Political and Legal Committee, the News and Publishing Office, the Commercial Bureau, the East China Special Envoy Office of the Central Foreign Trade Department, and the East China Office of the Central First Ministry of Machine Building all conducted discussions in connection with China's economic situation. Discussions were generally more prepared than in the past, but a few groups still had great difficulty in correctly understanding some of the main nouns and concepts during the discussion. In view of this situation, the Propaganda Department of the East China Bureau issued a study circular, requiring each group to complete the previously stipulated topics in order during this study, and should pay attention to understanding the main nouns and concepts in the document, and then use examples to demonstrate the spirit of the document to solve difficult problems. The senior groups of the economic departments should, on the basis of understanding the spirit of the document, focus on studying the leading role of the basic economic laws of socialism and the role of the law of value under the current conditions in our country. In addition, in adhering to the study system, special attention must be paid to solving the problem of make-up classes for absences. According to statistics from the senior groups of seventeen units in the four study times: for various reasons (mainly due to official travel), 34 percent of the total number of people could not participate in the study. Therefore, the Propaganda Department pointed out that in the future, for people who are out on official business, necessary and feasible study tasks should be specified or appropriate make-up lessons should be implemented; those who do not comply with the study system and are absent without reason should be given appropriate criticism.

    The study of "The Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR" in each unit will end on June 20. All personnel participating in the senior group study should uniformly implement the examination system at the end of the study. The examination is scheduled to be conducted in an appropriate manner between June 20 and 25. After the examination, preparation work such as the rectification of the study group will be carried out in order to effectively implement the "Instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on the Theoretical Education of Cadres in 1953-1954," and to begin studying Chapters IX to XII of the "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)" and a part of the works of Lenin and Stalin on socialist economic construction in July.

    华东一级机关高级学习组
    认真学习“苏联社会主义经济问题”
    华东一级机关高级学习组继续进行“苏联社会主义经济问题”的学习；此项学习将于六月中旬结束，并一律执行考试制度。在最近学习中，一般的已克服了过去不认真读书、不独立地思考与钻研问题，以及满足于表面上似乎是很热烈的而实际上却是无准备无中心的小组讨论会等偏向，使学习走上较正常的途径。
    最近，各组在认真自学的基础上，在研究了社会主义与资本主义的基本经济法则之后，也联系到当前中国经济情况，提出“价值法则在中国经济中的作用及活动范围如何？”等等问题。
    对于各组所提出的许多问题，陈毅同志都亲加审阅，并经华东局宣传部学习室加以整理归纳后发给各高级学习组，要求每一参加高级组学习的同志，对于每一问题都须经过自己独立的思考，阅读有关参考材料加以研究，并进行互助漫谈（但不召开无准备的全组讨论会），以便对这些问题都有自己初步的独立的见解。同时，为了准备解答问题以便把学习更向前推进一步，在陈毅同志亲自主持下，进行了华东一级机关干部理论学习顾问组的座谈会，座谈了各组所提出的许多问题中的若干带有关键性的问题。谭震林同志并亲自拟定了研究我国新民主主义经济问题的研究提要，指导学习顾问进行研究。
    在华东局负责同志亲自动手帮助解决学习中的疑难问题的精神推动之下，各高级组的学习，更有了进一步的开展。许多单位都在独立思考与研究的基础上，结合自己的学习进度，进行了漫谈和讨论。如华东文教委员会、华东局统战部、中国人民银行华东区行、复旦大学等高级组，讨论了关于经济法则有无目的性以及有无阶级性等问题。华东粮食管理局等单位讨论了经济法则与经济政策、经济计划之间的关系等问题。华东政法委员会、新闻出版处、商业管理局、中央对外贸易部华东特派员办事处以及中央第一机械工业部华东办事处等单位，都联系到中国经济情况进行了讨论。讨论会一般较过去有准备，但仍有少数组在讨论中对一些主要的名词概念不能正确了解，发生很大困难。鉴于此种情况，华东局宣传部特发出学习通报，要求各组在此次学习中，要根据过去所规定的题目依次学完，并应注意弄通文件中主要的名词概念，然后以实例论证文件的精神实质，解决疑难问题。经济部门的高级组并应在弄通文件精神实质的基础上，着重研究在我国现时条件下，社会主义基本经济法则的主导作用及价值法则的作用等问题。此外，在坚持学习制度上，须特别注意解决缺课补课问题。根据十七个单位高级组在四次学习时间内的统计：因各种原因
    （主要是因公外出）不能参加学习的达总人数的百分之三十四。因此，宣传部指出：今后对于因公外出人员，应规定其必要的可行的学习任务或实行适当的补课；对于不遵守学习制度与无故不到的人，应给以适当批评。
    各单位“苏联社会主义经济问题”的学习将于六月二十日结束，所有参加高级组学习的人员，在学习结束时，应一律执行考试制度。考试预定于六月二十日至二十五日以内以适当方式进行。考试后即进行学习组的整顿等准备工作，以便切实贯彻中共中央“关于一九五三—一九五四年干部理论教育的指示”，于七月份开始学习“联共（布）党史”第九章到十二章和列宁、斯大林论社会主义经济建设的一部分著作。（据解放日报讯）
