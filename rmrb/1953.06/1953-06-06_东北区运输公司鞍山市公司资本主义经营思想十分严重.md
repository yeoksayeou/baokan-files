    Anshan City Company of Northeast District Transportation Company Has Extremely Serious Capitalist Management Ideology
    A joint letter from 247 workers of the Motor Vehicle Team and Loading/Unloading Team of the State-owned Transportation Department of the Anshan City Company of the Northeast District Transportation Company: The Anshan City Company of the Northeast District Transportation Company has an extremely serious capitalist management ideology. Leading cadres of the company, Wen Biao, Li Qingchun, and others, in order to make profits, do not hesitate to violate government decrees and disregard the health of workers. Now we expose the facts as follows:
    When our company undertakes freight transport, most of it requires "daily work vehicles," that is, regardless of how much work is done each day, it is calculated as 220 ton-kilometers. When the company assigns drivers to "daily work vehicles," it also asks them to haul additional piece-rate work. In order to haul more assignments, some drivers secretly transport piece-rate work during their "daily work" time or return early on their own; leading cadres of the company are aware of these situations and do not stop them. Due to this speculative practice, the ton-kilometer transport figures listed in our company's statistical tables last year were very high, but the actual figures were not. The Northeast District Transportation Company knew that the transportation efficiency of "daily work vehicles" was not high, and at the end of last year, it instructed our company not to use "daily work vehicles" in the future. However, Deputy Manager Wen Biao, in order for the company to easily "complete its tasks" and increase income, did not implement this instruction, and our company still uses "daily work vehicles" as usual.
    Our company has consistently evaded road maintenance fees since 1952. Of the more than 40 vehicles in the company, on average, half of them do not pay road maintenance fees each month. Vehicles that do not pay road maintenance fees have to sneak around on long-distance trips or privately borrow road maintenance fee payment certificates. Last year, workers raised objections to this, and Deputy Manager Li Qingchun said, "The past was wrong, we will correct it in the future." But in reality, the evasion of road maintenance fees continues as before. In February of this year, twelve vehicles went to Shenyang to transport goods, seven of which evaded road maintenance fees; two were caught by the road maintenance station on the way and fined; the two deputy managers, Wen and Li, suspected that the drivers had reported them and were very dissatisfied.
    The company also does not seriously implement the government's regulations on annual vehicle inspections. Many vehicles are inspected and fined in Shenyang when they arrive to transport goods. When the fined drivers return, Hu Desheng, director of the state-owned transportation department, severely criticized them, saying, "Others come back without getting fined, you are so 'useless'!" Driver Huang Xuelin once went to Shenyang, first parked his car outside the city, and entered the city only after the people's police went off duty at midnight, unloaded the goods, and immediately left the city, staying overnight on the highway outside the city. Director Hu, after learning about Huang Xuelin's method of evading inspection, praised him greatly and said that he would send him to Shenyang more often in the future.
    The company's leading cadres completely disregard the safety and health of the workers. Loading and unloading workers often load and unload dangerous goods, but the company has never issued the necessary labor protection equipment. The company does not provide workers with rain gear, and forces workers to work in the rain. Once, more than 30 loading and unloading workers got sick from working in the rain. When the workers asked the company for money to buy raincoats, Deputy Manager Wen Biao refused. The situation of drivers working overtime is very serious. For example, in the third quarter of last year, drivers worked at least 12 hours a day, and some worked continuously for 32 hours. Some drivers were dozing off while driving. Workers raised objections, saying that they were too tired and accidents could easily occur. Director Hu Desheng said nonchalantly, "Anyway, you can get overtime pay!"
    What we have said above is only a small part of the problems that exist in our company. We hope that the Northeast District Transportation Company will quickly send people to inspect our company's work, thoroughly correct the various errors in our company, so that we can better serve the large-scale construction work in Anshan City.

### 东北区运输公司鞍山市公司资本主义经营思想十分严重

    东北区运输公司鞍山市公司资本主义经营思想十分严重
    东北区运输公司鞍山市公司国营运输部汽车队、装卸队二百四十七个工人联名来信：东北区运输公司鞍山市公司资本主义经营思想十分严重。该公司领导干部温标、李庆春等为了营利，不惜违反政府法令，漠视工人健康。现在我们把事实揭发如下：
    我公司承揽货运时，大部分要出日工车，即每天不管干多少活，都按二百二十吨公里计算。而公司在司机出日工车时，还叫额外多拉计件活。某些司机为了多拉任务，就在作日工的时间内偷运计件活，或者私自提早回来；公司领导干部知道这些情况，也不加制止。由于这种投机取巧的做法，去年我公司统计表上所列完成吨公里运输数字很大，实际上并不如此。东北区运输公司知道出日工车运输效率不高，在去年年底曾指示我公司以后不要再出日工车。但温标副经理为了本公司容易“完成任务”和增加收入，不执行这个指示，至今我公司还是照常出日工车。
    我公司从一九五二年起一贯偷漏养路费。公司里四十多台车，平均每月总有一半的车不上养路费。不上养路费的车出长途就得偷着走或私借养路费交纳证。去年工人曾对此提出意见，李庆春副经理说：“过去不对，今后改正。”但实际上还是照样偷漏养路费。今年二月有十二台车上沈阳运货，其中七台车是偷漏养路费的；途中被养路站查出了两辆，罚了款；温、李两位副经理还怀疑是司机检举的，大为不满。
    公司对政府规定的车辆年度检查也不认真执行。不少车运货到沈阳时就被检查出而照章罚款。被罚的司机回来了，国营运输部主任胡得胜还大加批评，说：“别人跑回来了，你真‘熊’！”司机黄学林有一次上沈阳，先把车停在市外，到半夜人民警察下岗后才进市，卸完货马上出市，在市外公路上住宿。胡主任知道了黄学林逃避检查的办法后，大加夸奖，并说以后还要多派他上沈阳。
    公司领导干部对工人的安全健康完全忽视。装卸工人经常装卸危险性物品，公司一直不发必需的劳动保护品。公司不给工人准备雨具，下雨天还逼着工人出勤。有一次有三十多个装卸工因出勤淋雨得了病。工人们向公司借钱买蓑衣，温标副经理也拒绝了。司机加班加点的情况很严重，如去年第三季度中，司机少者每天也要工作十二小时，多者连续工作三十二小时，有些司机开车时直打盹。工人提出意见，说是太累了，容易发生事故。胡得胜主任却满不在乎地说：“反正你们能拿加班加点费！”
    以上所说的只是我公司所存在问题的一小部分。我们希望东北区运输公司迅速派人来检查我公司的工作，彻底纠正我公司的各种错误现象，使我们能更好地为鞍山市大规模建设工作服务。
