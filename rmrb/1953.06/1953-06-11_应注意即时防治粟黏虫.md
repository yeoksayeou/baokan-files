    Immediate Prevention and Control of Millet Armyworm Should Be Emphasized
    Letter from Wei Hongjun, Department of Plant Protection, North China Agricultural Science Research Institute: The millet armyworm (also known as armyworm, cutworm, *zifang*, five-colored worm, etc.) is a major pest of Gramineae crops in China. In the North China region, it is extremely destructive to crops such as millet, corn, and sorghum. Many adult insects have now been found in Beijing and other places. In order to ensure increased production, I suggest that the main miscellaneous grain producing areas in North China and elsewhere should establish an insect situation inspection and reporting system, and carry out mass inspection work, so as to detect and prevent them as early as possible. The following three methods of prevention and control are available:

    I. Egg Collection: If egg masses are found during inspection, they should be collected and removed immediately.

    II. Manual Capture: If damage has already occurred, armyworm vehicles or armyworm nets should be used for capture.

    III. Chemical Control: In areas where conditions permit, 1%-3% DDT powder or 0.5% BHC powder can be used for dusting control, with approximately 4-6 *jin* of pesticide required per *mu*.

    The first and middle ten days of June are the most serious period for armyworm damage in North China, so it is even more important to carry out this work.

专栏：读者来信摘要

    应注意即时防治粟黏虫
    华北农业科学研究所植物保护系魏鸿钧来信：粟黏虫（又名行军虫、黏虫、虸蚄、五色虫等）为我国禾本科作物的大害虫，在华北地区为害谷子、玉米、高粱等庄稼极为剧烈。现在北京等地已发现很多成虫，为了保证增产，我建议华北等杂粮主要产区应建立虫情检查报告制度，开展群众性的检查工作，以便及早发现，作好防治工作。防治的方法有以下三种：
    一、采卵：经检查发现卵块后，应即发动采除。
    二、人工捕打：如已发生为害应用黏虫车或黏虫兜进行捕打。
    三、药剂防治：在有条件地区，可使用百分之一——百分之三滴滴涕粉或百分之零点五的六六六粉进行喷粉防治，每亩约需药剂四——六斤。
    华北地区六月上、中旬正是黏虫为害最严重的时期，开展这一工作更为重要。
