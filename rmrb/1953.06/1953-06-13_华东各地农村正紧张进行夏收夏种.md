Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangsu and other places are rushing to transplant mid-season rice and preparing for late rice transplanting. Dry-land grain areas are展开的summer weeding and seedling protection work. Party and government leading organs in areas affected by drought and pests are vigorously mobilizing the masses to fight drought and prevent floods, and to eliminate pests and protect seedlings. Mutual aid teams in various parts of Jiangsu Province have formulated summer production plans, determined to continue to fight against natural disasters, and do a good job in summer harvesting and planting. Party and government leading organs at all levels in various places have successively issued work instructions related to summer harvesting and planting. The Zhejiang Provincial People's Government pointed out in its instructions: Summer production is tense and busy. People's governments at all levels and all rural work cadres must not have any slack or麻痹ideological thoughts. They must continue to lead summer harvesting and planting with the spirit of leading spring plowing production. In order to complete the summer harvest and planting in a timely manner, temporary and seasonal mutual aid groups should be developed according to the wishes and requirements of the masses to overcome the difficulties of insufficient labor and cattle power during the busy farming season. The Jiangsu Provincial People's Government’s instructions on doing a good job in summer harvesting and planting and strengthening production and disaster relief work pointed out: Doing a good job in summer harvesting and planting is an important key to reducing summer crop failures and striving for increased autumn crop production. This year, wheat has suffered continuous natural disasters, and the maturity period varies. This is somewhat contradictory to the timely sowing of autumn fields. We must discuss with the local people, mobilize everyone to find ways based on local farming habits, and achieve timely harvesting without delaying summer planting. The instructions also pointed out, based on the characteristics of the disaster-stricken areas: It is necessary to strengthen production and disaster relief work in the disaster areas, further establish the confidence of cadres and the masses in the disaster areas in self-reliance in production, sticking to their posts locally, and overcoming the famine, and effectively solve various specific difficulties to ensure the timely completion of the summer harvest and planting.
