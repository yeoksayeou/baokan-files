    The People's Representative Conference in Doushan Township, Xiaoping District, Laiyang County, Shandong Province, was very successful.
    After the spring ploughing and sowing this year, Doushan Township in Xiaoping District, Laiyang County, Shandong Province, convened a township people's representative conference. This conference was relatively successful because the grassroots cadres began to change their work style in the struggle against bureaucracy. The meeting summarized and inspected the spring ploughing and sowing work, and formulated a work plan for before the "Mangzhong" (Grain in Ear) solar term. By reviewing the implementation of resolutions from the previous meeting, responsible cadres at the township level conducted self-criticism, fully promoted democracy, commended good people and deeds, and handled people's letters. This greatly improved the enthusiasm of the representatives, further educated the cadres, and promoted current work. The process and experience of the meeting are as follows:
    I. Making two preparations before the meeting. The first is to educate cadres, correct their thinking, and attach importance to the people's representative conference. Although the people's representative conference in Doushan Township had already been initially held once a month, many erroneous understandings still existed in the minds of rural grassroots cadres. Some confused the people's representative conference with cadre meetings, often treating the representatives with a superior attitude, conveying more and discussing less during meetings, and arranging more tasks from higher levels while solving fewer problems of the masses. Some believed that the representative conference, held once a month, was a system stipulated by higher authorities, and that holding meetings was a "routine," thus making the meetings the same old thing and a mere formality. Before this meeting, a township government committee meeting was held to conduct democratic education, explaining that the people's representative conference is the basic system of our country at present, and the township people's representative conference is the organ for the people of the entire township to exercise their power. The township government is responsible to the representative conference, which means it is responsible to the masses. This improved the cadres' understanding and made them begin to value the people's representative conference in their thinking. The second is to enhance the representatives' sense of being masters of their own affairs. Due to the cadres' insufficient understanding of the representative conference in the past, insufficient respect for the representatives' opinions, and lack of seriousness in handling proposals, some representatives were not interested in the meeting, and the number of attendees gradually decreased. Before this meeting, the cadres went deep into the masses, assisted the representatives in collecting opinions from the masses, and put forward proposals, which added concrete content to the meeting. The representatives also felt that this meeting was better than the previous ones. The meeting was held for two nights, and the representatives were in high spirits. The first night, 38 representatives attended, and the second night, the number increased to 46.
    II. The focus of the meeting was clear, the report content was simple and concise, the time was short, the truth was told, and practical things were done. The guiding principle of making agricultural production the overriding central task was vigorously implemented. Whether in summarizing work, inspecting work, formulating plans, or commending and criticizing, all were closely linked to spring ploughing production and related to the urgent needs of the masses. The meeting process was very intense, the representatives were in high spirits, and their attitude was serious. Everyone reflected: "This time I don't feel sleepy at all during the meeting," "What was said was all true, close to the bone, and really touched my heart."
    III. Fully promote democracy, inspect the leadership of the township government, with commendation and criticism, and democratically formulate work plans. Because the leadership style of the township began to change, the resolutions of the previous meeting were conscientiously implemented, the masses were organized to carry out spring ploughing and sowing in a timely manner, deep plowing, more loosening, and fine harrowing were achieved; mutual aid groups were rectified and consolidated; specific technical guidance was provided for the planting of crops such as millet, sweet potatoes, peanuts, and taro; and in terms of substituting for cultivation and disaster relief, practical difficulties were solved for military families and disaster victims. Therefore, the representatives were relatively satisfied with the work of the township government in the past month. At the same time, the responsible cadres of the township made a relatively profound self-criticism in the summary, which enhanced the courage of the representatives to conduct criticism. Everyone put forward many opinions on the government's work during this period, such as the leadership of mutual aid groups was not comprehensive, focusing on advanced groups and neglecting lower-level groups, and insufficient leadership for individual farmers, as well as incomplete technical guidance and untimely handling of people's letters. According to the opinions put forward by the representatives, the responsible cadres of the township made supplementary self-criticisms, which greatly educated the representatives and cadres. The cadres deeply realized that a generalized work method is thankless, and they must continue to change their style and work down-to-earth. The representatives also realized that they should be serious about serving the masses and can no longer be "guests." On this basis, a work plan for the future was formulated: continuing to carry out crash planting by "seizing moisture" and "borrowing moisture," checking seedlings and replanting, vigorously eliminating pests, thinning and transplanting seedlings at the right time, implementing close planting, strengthening technical guidance, and doing a good job in other tasks related to production.
    IV. Handling people's letters through the township people's representative conference can not only educate cadres to change their work style and solve the difficulties of having few people and many affairs, but also enhance the representatives' sense of ownership and give full play to the supervision of government staff by the people. At this meeting, the chairman reported the facts of the four people's letters received to the representatives, combined with policy education, distinguished the nature of the issues, drew clear lines, and then democratically discussed the handling methods. The representatives spoke very enthusiastically and handled the matters very carefully. For example, regarding the incident of Yu Pu, the deputy secretary of the township's general branch, interfering with the remarriage of his sister-in-law Xiao Guihua (widow) and withholding property, the representatives criticized him and requested the county people's court to handle the matter according to policy. The leading cadres of the township government expressed their attitude on the spot, determined to deal with it quickly according to the representatives' opinions. The representatives were very satisfied, believing that the Communist Party and the People's Government were truly selfless, and that the people's representative conference truly embodied the spirit of the people being masters of their own affairs, thus greatly enhancing their confidence in performing their duties.
    V. Conscientiously implementing and organizing the implementation of resolutions and timely handling of proposals are important tasks for consolidating the achievements of the meeting. Therefore, after the meeting, on the one hand, it is necessary to enable the representatives to learn the methods of implementation through forums or individual talks, and on the other hand, to educate the cadres to clarify the basic spirit of the resolutions in their thinking. At the same time, it is necessary to supervise the relevant parties to quickly and conscientiously handle the proposals. The cadres of the Laiyang County People's Court, on the second day after the end of the representative conference, went to the township in person to cooperate with the representatives in handling the case of Yu Pu interfering with the remarriage of the widow. Yu Pu made a public self-criticism and allowed Xiao Guihua to remarry with her property. Some cadres in Liuguzhuang in the township had a bad attitude towards the masses. The masses went to the representatives and asked them to offer opinions on the cadres at the representative conference. The representatives immediately told the cadres, and the cadres took the initiative to make a self-criticism to the masses and solved the problem. Therefore, the masses' trust in the representatives was improved, and they all said:
    "The representative conference can really do things. If there is anything in the future, we will go to the representatives."

### 山东莱阳县小平区陡山乡人民代表会议开得很好

    山东莱阳县小平区陡山乡人民代表会议开得很好
    山东省莱阳县小平区陡山乡在今年春耕播种结束后，召开了一次乡人民代表会议。这次会议由于基层干部在反对官僚主义斗争中开始转变了作风，因此开得比较成功。会上总结和检查了春耕播种工作，制订了“芒种”前的工作计划；并通过检查上届会议决议执行情况，乡上负责干部进行了检讨，开展批评与自我批评，充分发扬民主；表扬了好人好事，结合处理了人民来信。因而大大提高了代表的积极性，进一步教育了干部，推动了当前工作。会议的经过情形和经验是：
    一、会前作好两项准备工作。第一是教育干部，端正思想，重视人民代表会议。陡山乡的人民代表会议过去虽然已经初步作到每月召开一次，但在乡村基层干部的思想上，还存在着许多错误认识。有的把人民代表会议和干部会混为一谈，往往以上级的态度来对待代表，开会时传达多，商讨少，布置上级任务多，解决群众问题少。有的认为代表会议
    一月开一次，是上级规定的制度，开会是“例行公事”，因此使会议老一套，流于形式。这次会议以前，召开了乡政府委员会议，进行民主教育，说明人民代表会议是目前我们国家的基本制度，乡人民代表会议是全乡人民行使政权的机关，乡政府对代表会议负责，也就是对群众负责。这就使干部的认识提高了，从思想上开始重视了人民代表会议。第二是提高代表当家作主人的思想。由于过去干部对代表会议的认识不足，对代表的意见尊重不够，对提案处理不够认真，使得部分代表对会议不感兴趣，到会人数逐次减少。这次会前干部都深入群众，协助代表收集群众意见，提出提案，给会议增加了具体内容，代表们也感到这次会议比前几次都好。会议开了两个晚上，代表情绪很高，头天晚上到会代表三十八人，第二天晚上就增加到四十六人。
    二、会议中心明确，报告内容简单扼要，时间短，说真话，办实事。有力地贯彻了以农业生产为压倒一切的中心任务方针。不论在总结工作，检查工作，制订计划和表扬批评等方面都密切结合着春耕生产，都关系到群众的迫切要求。会议过程非常紧张，代表情绪高涨，态度认真。大家反映：“这次开会一点不觉得瞌睡了”，“说的都是真情实话，贴筋贴骨，真说到心上了。”
    三、充分发扬民主，检查乡政府领导，有表扬有批评，民主制订工作计划。由于乡的领导作风开始转变，认真执行了上届会议决议，组织群众适时地进行了春耕播种，作到了深耕、多刨、细耙；整顿与巩固了互助组；具体进行了谷子、地瓜、花生、芋头等农作物在种植方面的技术指导；代耕和救灾方面，也给军属和灾民解决了实际困难。因此，代表们对乡政府一月来的工作是比较满意的。同时，乡上负责干部在总结中又作了比较深刻的自我检讨，增强了代表进行批评的勇气，大家对这一时期的政府工作提出了许多意见，如领导互助组不全面，重视高级组，忽视低级组，对单干农民领导也不够，以及技术指导不全面，处理人民来信不及时等。根据代表提出的意见，乡上负责干部又作了补充检讨，对代表和干部的教育都很大。干部深刻体会到：一般化的工作方法是吃力不讨好，必须继续转变作风，脚踏实地的去干。代表也认识到：为群众办事应当认真，再不能“作客”了。在此基础上制订了今后工作计划：“抢墒”、“借墒”继续突击播种，查苗、补苗，大力消除虫害，适时间苗、挖苗，贯彻密植，加强技术指导，并围绕生产作好其它各项工作。
    四、通过乡人民代表会议处理人民来信，不仅能教育干部转变作风，解决人少事繁的困难，同时也能提高代表的主人翁思想，充分发挥人民群众对政府工作人员的监督作用。这次会议上主席将接到的四件人民来信的案情向代表作了报告，结合进行政策教育，分清性质，划清界限，然后民主讨论处理办法。代表发言都很热烈，处理得很慎重。如该乡总支副书记于浦干涉他嫂萧桂花（寡妇）改嫁、勒留财产一事，代表们进行了批评，并要求县人民法院按照政策处理，乡政府领导干部当场表示态度，决心按代表意见迅速处理，代表都很满意，认为共产党和人民政府真是大公无私，认为人民代表会议确实体现了人民当家作主的精神，因而大大提高了履行自己职权的信心。
    五、认真贯彻与组织执行决议和及时处理提案是巩固会议成果的重要工作。因此在会议之后，就必须一方面通过座谈或个别谈话方式，使代表学会贯彻的方法，一方面教育干部从思想上明确决议的基本精神。同时，并督促有关方面迅速认真处理提案。莱阳县人民法院干部，在代表会议结束后的第二天，就亲到乡上协同代表处理了于浦干涉寡妇改嫁案，于浦当众作了检讨，并允许萧桂花带产改嫁。该乡柳古庄有的干部对群众态度不好，群众去找代表，要求在代表会议上给干部提意见，代表马上就告诉了干部，干部主动地向群众作了检讨，解决了问题。因此，提高了群众对代表的信任，都说：
    “代表会真能办事，今后有事就找代表。”
