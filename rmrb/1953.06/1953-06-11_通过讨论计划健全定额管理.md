Sound Quota Management Through Discussion and Planning
Yu Wen, Director of the Fifth Cement Plant of the Building Materials Industry Bureau

I. Unsound Quota Management Affects the Comprehensive and Balanced Completion of Production Plans

Although our plant generally fulfills various targets in the implementation of state plans, there is a major shortcoming: a serious imbalance in production. Looking at the implementation of the annual plan, the completion of various targets such as output, quality, cost, and capital turnover rate fluctuates greatly from month to month. Looking at the implementation of the monthly plan, the daily or ten-day output is very uneven. For example, in 1952, cement production in the highest month exceeded the plan by 25%, while in the lowest month it only completed 75% of the plan, with a total of seven months failing to meet the state plan. In terms of equipment utilization, the operating time of the two large kilns exceeded the plan by 14% in the highest month, and only completed 86% of the plan in the lowest month; the average hourly output of the two kilns exceeded the plan by 6% at best and only completed 90% of the plan at worst. Furthermore, looking at the unit cost of cement, the lowest month was 7% lower than the plan, while the highest month was only 0.22% lower than the plan. The equilibrium rate for the execution of the monthly production plan reached a maximum of only 89.66%.

Why can't the state plan be fully and evenly completed? One of the main reasons is that quota management has not been fully implemented in the past. This is specifically reflected in the following aspects: In terms of output quotas: Although daily production plans were prepared in the past, the production section simply divided the monthly plan by the number of days and distributed it to the workshops for implementation. There was no full consideration of the actual situation, and workers were not mobilized to discuss the plans. Because they were impractical and impossible to implement, they became a mere formality. Everyone remained unconcerned about whether the daily plan was completed and how much should be produced the next day. Only in the last ten days of the month, when it became apparent that the task was in danger of not being completed, did everyone become anxious. In terms of quality quotas: Although quality responsibility cards were implemented in the past, the division of labor between the production section and the inspection section was unclear, workers lacked sufficient understanding of quality, and the quality inspection department and the dispatch department had unclear responsibilities for supervising the quality of each work section. The quality responsibility cards only served as bulletin boards, and quality work was almost left to no one's responsibility. In terms of material quotas: Material costs account for more than 50% of the cost of cement. In the past, our plant only had the materials section estimate a material cost target for each workshop, and the workshop would then formulate a monthly plan based on this target, and the supply and marketing section would issue material requisition cards based on the workshop's monthly plan; however, the material quotas were not thoroughly implemented down to the groups and workers. Therefore, the material requisition cards also became a formality, and requests for additional plans or stockpiling of materials frequently occurred. In terms of capital quotas: Our plant had many shortcomings in capital quota management in the past, mainly due to incorrect material quotas, which led to capital stockpiling; secondly, the plant lacked a comprehensive operation plan, which failed to organically link the work of each department. As a result, the work of the production, supply and marketing, and finance departments often became disconnected, and sometimes unnecessary capital stockpiling occurred due to poor coordination. For example, if the production section reduced engineering projects but failed to promptly notify the supply and marketing section to change the supply plan, the materials would arrive and have to be stockpiled in the warehouse; or if the supply and marketing section only knew about supply and did not consult with the finance section on relevant capital issues, it would also cause unnecessary losses in capital turnover.

II. Mobilizing the Masses to Formulate Practical and Feasible Advanced Quotas in the Discussion of Plans

Correct quotas are the foundation for implementing planned management. Our plant's revision of quotas was completed through discussion of plans, rectification of original records, and mobilization of the masses to find tips and tap potential. In the process of discussing and formulating various quotas, thorough ideological mobilization was carried out to make workers deeply aware of the importance of various quotas, seriously study the key issues of various quotas, and tap the potential of various quotas. As a result, many quotas were raised, and the formulation of each quota had specific completion methods, and all quotas were determined by means of hierarchical review. Such quotas are not only advanced but also practical and feasible. For example, the hourly output quota of the rotary kiln was increased from 11.5 tons per hour to 12.3 tons. The specific measures were to restore water cooling, replace the coal blowing whistle, and unify the three-shift operation. The hourly output of the cement mill was increased from 17 tons to 18 tons for Mill No. 1, and from 10.5 tons to 12 tons for Mill No. 2. The specific measures were to change the central blind plate of the cement mill to a grate plate, use a auger type at the inlet, and adjust the steel balls. The coal consumption quota for the calcination workshop was reduced from 395 kg to 340 kg. The specific measures were to adopt the operation method of adjusting the air volume and coal feed to save coal. Regarding equipment maintenance, a sectional maintenance method was adopted to shorten the maintenance time. In addition, during the plan discussion campaign, various consumable materials, tools, and man-hours were standardized, so that the general consumable material quota was reduced by 13% compared with the original plan, and the tool quota was reduced by 30%. The supply and marketing section and the finance section also improved their management work, discussed quotas for reserves, costs, and capital, and corrected many incorrect and impractical quotas.

III. Promoting Comprehensive Quota Management by Starting with Improving Operation Plans

After formulating advanced and practical quotas, the next step is to implement and consolidate quota management. Based on past lessons, we have formulated group operation plans that include various quotas, so that quotas can be implemented down to the grassroots level. A comprehensive operation plan organically links the work of various departments, including items such as output, quality, labor, maintenance, supply, finance, and cost. It is also supported by a responsibility system and an inspection system, so that quota management can be consolidated.

After the mass discussion of quota management, our plant carried out quota management work in the following aspects:

1. Output and Equipment Utilization Quotas: The management of output and equipment utilization quotas has a relatively good foundation due to the past implementation of production instruction charts; however, insufficient work has been done in dealing with problems that affect rhythmic production and preventing these problems from occurring in the process of production according to the production instruction charts. Therefore, when groups formulate operation plans, they focus on determining the responsibility system in production, such as who is responsible for repairing a certain equipment, who is responsible for regular inspection, and what responsibilities the team leader, foreman, and workshop director have in production, all of which are predetermined; in addition, a joint manual of the three shifts was established to record production conditions in order to check the implementation of the instruction charts and handle the problems that occur in production according to the instruction charts, which improved the role of the instruction charts.

2. Quality Quotas: Through this plan discussion, workers have a clearer understanding of quality, so the quality quotas of each work section were further determined, and the original quality responsibility card system was also enriched. In order to implement quality indicators, first, the quality dispatching work of the production section was incorporated into the inspection section to ensure consistent steps; second, chemical and technical personnel were assigned according to specific responsibilities. Workers in each work section of the workshop who are responsible for quality hold quality responsibility cards, and the inspection personnel of the inspection section fill in the quality figures on time. If the quality is not up to standard, the specialized technical personnel of the inspection section instruct the responsible workers to adjust in time through the shift foreman of the production workshop. In this way, every indicator of quality has a dedicated person responsible for mastering it, and at the same time, those that are unqualified are strengthened to supervise. Since then, although the quality responsibility card is an original record, it has played a supervisory role. In addition, a material allocation system has been established, and the storage and use of all materials are the responsibility of dedicated personnel. The amount of use must be determined according to the chemical composition after inspection, so as to control the quality in advance.

3. Material and Man-hour Consumption Quotas: In order to implement the material quotas to the groups, each group in the workshop generally established a "Material Quota Card." Workers who master this card know what the quota is and how much has been used, and often try to reduce the quota. In this way, the material quota card plays both a control role and is the grassroots original record of material consumption. In addition, a "Five-Day Material Delivery System" was implemented, in which the workshop sends a material plan every five days, and the warehouse delivers materials according to the workshop's material plan. One workshop or two workshops are delivered every day, so that production workers do not have to go to the warehouse to wait for materials, and the warehouse's business is also reduced, and five days of work can be completed in three days. In terms of man-hour quotas, a "Man-hour Usage Registration Card" was established, one for each person, filling in the work situation of the eight hours. The team leader can master the summary table and can allocate work in time, which eliminates the phenomenon of man-hour waste; it is estimated that 108 workdays can be saved throughout the year.

4. Material Reserve and Capital Quotas: Through the discussion of the plan, practical output quotas and material consumption quotas were formulated, so that raw material reserve and capital quotas can also be formulated correctly. The supply and marketing section and the finance section further strengthened quota management and established material supply and reserve volume instruction charts, financial revenue and expenditure instruction charts, and major repair and measure engineering cost instruction charts; in this way, financial activities have changed from being passive in the past to being proactive, and the financial plan indicators can be overfulfilled.

At the same time, we believe that implementing quota management must be combined with labor competitions and rewards. Therefore, after formulating group operation plans, competition scoring is based on the completion figures of the operation plans. We are now studying reward methods to encourage everyone to strive for the completion and exceeding of quotas.

    通过讨论计划健全定额管理
    建筑器材工业管理局第五水泥厂厂长  于文
    一、定额管理不健全，影响全面均衡地完成生产计划
    我厂在执行国家计划当中，虽然一般地都能完成各项指标，但有一个主要缺点，就是在生产中存在着严重的不均衡现象。就全年的计划执行情况来看，各月份的产量、质量、成本、资金周转率等各项指标的完成情况波动很大。就月计划的执行情况来看，则逐日或各旬的产量很不均衡，如一九五二年水泥产量，最高月超过计划百分之二十五，最低月只完成计划的百分之七十五，全年就有七个月没有完成国家计划。从设备运用情况来看，两个大窑的运转时间，最高月超过计划百分之十四，最低月只完成计划的百分之八十六；两窑的平均时产量，最高超过计划百分之六，最低只完成计划的百分之九十。再从水泥单位成本来看，最低月比计划降低百分之七，最高月只比计划降低百分之零点二二。再就月生产计划的执行情况来看，均衡率最高只达到百分之八九点六六。
    为什么国家计划不能全面均衡地完成呢？主要原因之一是过去没有全面贯彻定额管理工作。具体表现在以下各方面：产量定额方面：过去虽然编制了逐日生产计划，但只是由生产科将月计划按天数分一分，就发给各车间执行，并没有充分考虑实际情况，也没有发动工人讨论，因不切实际，执行不通，就流于形式。大家对日计划的完成与否以及第二天应该生产多少，仍然是不关心；到下旬眼看着任务有完不成的危险，这才紧张起来。质量定额方面：过去虽然执行了质量责任卡片，但生产科和检查科分工不清，工人对质量认识不足，质量检查部门和调度部门对各工段质量的督促责任也不明确，质量责任卡片只起了揭示板的作用，质量工作几乎是陷于无人负责的状态中。材料定额方面：在水泥成本里，材料费要占到百分之五十以上。我厂过去只由材料科估计出一个车间材料费指标，车间即根据这个指标作出月计划，供销科也就根据车间的月计划发领料卡片；但材料定额并没有深入贯彻到小组和工人里去；因此，领料卡片也就流于形式，经常发生追加计划或积压材料的情形。资金定额方面：我厂过去在资金定额管理工作上存在着很多缺点，主要是由于材料定额不正确，造成了资金积压；其次是全厂缺乏一个全面的作业计划，未能将各科的工作有机地联系起来。因此，生产、供销、财务三个部门的工作就经常有脱节的现象，有时就因为联系得不好，造成不应有的资金积压。例如生产科削减了工程项目，没有及时通知供销科变更供应计划，结果材料来了，只好压在仓库里；或者是供销科只知道供应，不与财务科商讨有关资金的问题，也造成了资金周转上不应有的损失。
    二、在讨论计划中发动群众制订切实可行的先进定额
    正确的定额，是实施计划管理的基础。我厂修订定额工作，是通过讨论计划、整顿原始记录和发动群众找窍门挖潜力来完成的。在讨论和制订各项定额的过程中，进行了彻底的思想动员，使工人深刻认识到各项定额的重要性，认真研究各项定额的关键问题，对各种定额挖掘潜力，因之很多定额都提高了，而且每一项定额的制订都有具体的完成办法，所有的定额又都是用逐级审查的办法来确定的。这样的定额，不但是先进的，而且是切实可行的。如旋窑的时产量定额，由每小时一一点五吨提高到一二点三吨，具体的措施是恢复水冷却，改换吹煤啸，统一三班操作。水泥磨的时产量，一号磨由一七吨提高到一八吨，二号磨由一○点五吨提高到一二吨，具体的措施是将水泥磨中心盲板改为篦子板，入口改用绞刀式以及调整钢球等。烧成车间煤消耗定额由三九五公斤降低到三四○公斤，具体的措施是采用了调整风量，下煤量以节省煤的操作法。关于设备检修，则采用了分部检修办法，缩短了检修的时间。又在讨论计划运动中，对各种消耗材料以及工具、工时进行标定，使一般的消耗材料定额比原计划降低百分之十三，工具定额降低百分之三十。供销科和财务科也都改进了管理工作，讨论了储备量、成本和资金等定额，修正了很多不正确、不切合实际的定额。
    三、从健全作业计划着手推行全面的定额管理
    制订了先进而切实可行的定额后，进一步就是贯彻和巩固定额管理工作。我们根据过去的教训，制订了包括各项定额的工组作业计划，这样，定额就能贯彻到基层去。而全面的作业计划，是将各个部门的工作有机地联系起来，内容包括产量、质量、劳动、检修、供应、财务、成本等项目，还配合以责任制和检查制度，这样，定额管理才能巩固起来。
    经过群众性讨论定额管理后，我厂在以下各方面进行了定额管理工作：
    1、产量和设备运用定额：产量和设备运用定额的管理，因过去推行生产指示图，比较有基础；但在按生产指示图进行生产的过程中，处理某些影响有节奏生产的问题和预防这些问题的发生上是做得不够的。因此，在工组制订作业计划时，就着重确定了生产中的责任制，如某一设备由谁负责修理，由谁负责经常检查，组长、工长和车间主任在生产中负那些责任，都预先规定；又建立了三班联合手册的原始记录，记载生产情况，以便检查指示图表执行情形，处理按指示图表进行生产中所发生的问题，这样就将指示图表的作用提高了一步。
    2、质量定额：通过这次讨论计划，工人对质量的认识明确了，因而进一步确定了各工段的质量定额，也充实了原有的质量责任卡片制。为了贯彻质量指标，首先将生产科的质量调度工作并入检查科，使得步调一致；其次就将化工技术人员按专责分工。车间各工段负质量责任的工人，都持有质量责任卡片，由检查科的检验人员按时填入质量数字，如发生质量不合标准时，就由检查科的专责技术人员通过生产车间的值班工长指示负责工人及时调整。这样，就做到质量的每一项指标都有专人负责掌握，同时对不合格的做到加强督促，从此质量责任卡片虽是一种原始记录，却起了督促的作用。此外又建立了物料调配制度，一切物料的保管和使用，都有专人负责，必须经过检验后，根据化学成分决定使用量，做到质量的事前控制。
    3、材料和工时耗用定额：为了将材料定额贯彻到工组里，车间各工组普遍建立“材料定额卡片”。工人掌握了这项卡片，就知道定额是多少和已经使用了多少，经常设法降低定额。这样，材料定额卡片既起了控制作用，同时又是材料消耗的基层原始记录。此外还实行了“五日送料制”，车间每五天送一次材料计划，仓库即按车间材料计划送料，每日送一个车间或两个车间，这样，生产工人就不用到仓库去等料领料，而仓库的业务也减轻了，五天的工作，三天就能做完。在工时定额方面，则建立了“工时使用登记卡片”，每人一册，填入八小时的工作情况，工组长掌握了汇总表就可及时调配工作，这就消灭了工时浪费的现象；估计全年可节约
    一百零八个工日。
    4、材料储备和资金定额：通过讨论计划，制订了切合实际的产量定额和材料消耗定额，因而原材料储备和资金定额也就能正确地制订了。供销科和财务科就更进一步加强定额管理，建立材料供应和储备量指示图、财务收支指示图、大修理及措施工程费用指示图等；这样，财务活动就由过去的被动转为主动，做到超额完成财务计划指标。
    同时我们认为贯彻定额管理工作，必须结合劳动竞赛与奖励，因之在制订工组作业计划后，就根据作业计划的完成数字来作竞赛评分。现正在研究奖励办法，以鼓励大家为完成与超过定额而奋斗。
