Cultural Exchange Between the Soviet Union and People's Democratic Countries
President of the Soviet Society for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, Denisov

    Between the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries, a new and supreme form of international relations, never before seen in history, has been formed. This international relationship is built on the principles of proletarian internationalism, on the equality of rights of all nations, large and small, on promoting economic and cultural cooperation, and on respecting national independence and the sovereignty of all countries. The socialist system creates all the necessary conditions for friendly cooperation and peace among all peoples.

    The working people of the People's Democratic countries visit the Soviet Union with fervent aspirations, eager to learn about the achievements of the Soviet Union in its economic, political, and cultural life.

    J.V. Stalin wrote in his work "Economic Problems of Socialism in the U.S.S.R.":

    "Our foreign comrades want to know how we freed ourselves from the shackles of capitalism, how we transformed the national economy in a socialist spirit, how we achieved friendly relations with the peasants, how we transformed our country, which was once poor and weak, into a rich and powerful country, what collective farms are, and why we have not eliminated commodity production, money, trade, etc., even though the means of production are publicly owned. They want to know all this and much more, not simply out of curiosity, but to learn from us and to use our experience for their own countries."

    The Soviet people cordially welcome guests from the People's Democratic countries, who are willing to see the Soviet Union with their own eyes, understand its achievements, and exchange experiences with the Soviet people. The Soviet people and their agencies, organizations, etc., provide all delegations with every opportunity to understand all aspects of life in their country, to meet and talk with people of all nationalities, professions, and ages.

    The delegates study industrial and agricultural enterprises, scientific institutions and schools, hospitals and sanatoriums, Children's Palaces and Young Pioneer summer camps, and the residences of workers and collective farm members in a deep, comprehensive, and highly attentive manner. In short, they pay close attention to studying the diverse lives of the Soviet people. They are free to meet with whomever they wish, to publish talks in Soviet newspapers or broadcast on the radio, and to participate in creative discussions, especially those regularly held by the departments of the Soviet Society for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries and the Soviet Writers' Union, the Soviet Composers' Union, the Soviet Architects' Union, etc. Currently visiting the Soviet Union is the delegation of the All-China Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, headed by Li Fu-ren, which is receiving a warm welcome.

    Innovators in industry and agriculture convey their experiences to friends from the People's Democratic countries. The working people of the Soviet state—workers and peasants, cultural workers, enterprise and agency employees, professors and university students, teachers and elementary school students, actors and artists—are happy to exchange their knowledge and ideas with these friends. At the Dzerzhinsky Factory in the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, metallurgical workers from China and Bulgaria are increasingly improving their knowledge.

    Various Soviet delegations (such as trade union delegations, cultural worker delegations, women's delegations, youth delegations, and sports delegations) invited by various social organizations and state agencies to visit the People's Democratic countries have played a significant role in strengthening cultural cooperation and friendship between the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries.

    Many Soviet delegations frequently visit China, Poland, the German Democratic Republic, Czechoslovakia, Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, Albania, etc., where they study the economic and cultural achievements of the People's Democratic Republics, the daily lives of the people, and places of historical and cultural value. They give reports at meetings of workers, peasants, students, and university students, as well as at mass rallies, deliver speeches at expert conferences, introduce the Soviet Union, its achievements, and its peace-loving aspirations to the working people, and they exchange their knowledge and work experience. For example, Soviet delegation representatives such as bricklayer Shaplyugin, lathe operator Bekov, textile worker Ananyeva, and miner Filimonov participated in meetings of production rationalization workers in Hungary during their visit in 1949. They exchanged experiences in Stakhanovite work methods with Hungarian workers. In 1952, Soviet delegation representative and bricklayer Korolev participated in the celebration of the fifth anniversary of the founding of the German-Soviet Friendship Association and met with construction workers and engineers in Berlin and other cities in the German Democratic Republic. Korolev demonstrated his bricklaying method on the construction site, showing high labor productivity and helping young workers in the German Democratic Republic quickly improve their skills.

    Upon returning to their homeland, Soviet delegations report to the working people, describing their impressions from their journeys. In addition to publishing articles in newspapers and magazines, they also write dedicated books and provide introductions in radio broadcasts.

    The exchange of literature, science, and art is of great significance in the cultural cooperation between the Soviet people and the People's Democratic countries. The Library of the Soviet Academy of Sciences and many foreign scientific institutions have established regular contacts. The Soviet Academy of Sciences sends many periodicals and papers to foreign scientific institutions. The Moscow State Lenin Library and other scientific institutions play a significant role in this regard.

    The Soviet Society for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries sends Soviet magazines, newspapers, scientific books, artworks, and children's literature to libraries in the People's Democratic countries, which are affiliated with groups promoting friendship and cultural exchange between the People's Democratic countries and the Soviet Union.

    Soviet organizations, agencies, and individuals also receive many scientific books and literary works from the People's Democratic countries.

    The Soviet people have shown great interest in the literature and art of the People's Democratic countries. The Soviet Publishing Bureau has published a large number of books by writers from the People's Democratic countries. For example, books by Chinese writers have been published in eighteen Soviet national languages, books by Polish writers have been published in more than seven million copies, and books by Czechoslovakian writers have been published in more than five million copies.

    Outstanding works by many writers from the various countries have won Stalin Prizes.

    Representative conferences of scientific representatives from various countries are one form of cultural cooperation between the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries. The International Conference of Agricultural Scientists from the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries, held in Prague in January 1953, is typical of this. Participants in this representative conference included: a Soviet agricultural science delegation headed by Orshansky, Deputy Director of the Soviet Lenin Academy of Agricultural Sciences, as well as delegations from Poland, Romania, Hungary, and the German Democratic Republic.

    The representative conference discussed the most important issues in agricultural science and how to promote cooperation between scientific institutions in the countries of the peace camp. The representative conference promoted the wider application of Soviet agricultural science achievements in the People's Democratic countries and promoted the achievements of agricultural science in the People's Democratic countries.

    Soviet cultural groups, accepting invitations from groups promoting friendship and cultural cooperation with the Soviet Union in various countries, have carried out activities in the People's Democratic countries, sending theater troupes, art troupes, and some actors to these countries. The Moscow Theater, the Soviet State Folk Dance Ensemble directed by Igor Moiseyev, the Soviet Army Song and Dance Ensemble, the Russian Song National Choir directed by A. Sveshnikov, the Pyatnitsky State Russian Folk Choir, the State Central Puppet Theater directed by Sergei Obraztsov, the Leningrad Pushkin Drama Theater, and the Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic Folk Dance Art Troupe, among others, have visited the People's Democratic countries at different times.

    The Soviet people are extremely interested in the artistic development of the People's Democratic countries, and they warmly welcome actors and musicians from the People's Democratic countries. Theater troupes from China, Albania, Romania, Czechoslovakia, and other countries have performed in the Soviet Union. In January 1953, the opera troupe and the Mazowsze Song and Dance Ensemble from Poznań, Poland, performed in Moscow. The Soviet government expressed its gratitude to the artists from the Polish People's Republic. Cultural representatives from various brotherly republics not only performed their achievements and exchanged experiences for the Soviet people in the Soviet Union, but also absorbed the advanced experiences of the Soviet Union. In recent days, the performances of the Korean People's Army Song and Dance Troupe in Moscow, Leningrad, and other major cities have achieved great success.

    In addition to performing classical music by Chopin, Moniuszko, Dvořák, Smetana, etc., many concert halls in the Soviet Union also perform modern music by composers from China, Korea, Poland, Czechoslovakia, and other countries. Soviet theaters are staging plays by playwrights from China, Korea, Romania, Bulgaria, and other countries.

    The holding of film exhibitions has become a tradition between the People's Democratic countries and the Soviet Union, and these film exhibitions have reviewed the strength and achievements of the free nations' film art. Soviet films have occupied a prominent position on the screens of the People's Democratic countries. Films produced by filmmakers in these countries are also constantly shown in the Soviet Union. In recent years, film exhibitions have been held in the Soviet Union for China, Korea, Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Romania, and film exhibitions have also been held for films produced by film artists from the German Democratic Republic. Not long ago, the Second Hungarian Film Exhibition was held in the Soviet Union. During the days of the film exhibition, tens of thousands of viewers in Moscow, Leningrad, Kiev, Minsk, and other Soviet cities saw the best Hungarian films, and they also visited exhibitions showcasing the achievements of the Hungarian people's cultural life. In cinemas and clubs in Moscow, audiences met with representatives of the delegation of filmmakers from the Hungarian People's Republic.

    Film exhibitions mark a further consolidation of friendship and cultural cooperation between the People's Democratic countries.

    Under the same banner, athletes from the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries have organized joint performances. Therefore, in January 1953, a skating dance performance competition was held at the "Dynamo" Stadium in Moscow between athletes from the Soviet Union, Hungary, and Czechoslovakia. The performance program concluded with a "Waltz of Friendship" performed by all the athletes.

    The content of cultural cooperation between the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries is generally as described above.

    The above situation shows that the people of the Soviet Union and the people of other People's Democratic countries have formed a broad front in developing international cultural cooperation, and they deeply appreciate the importance of this cause.

    The Soviet people are devout advocates of developing international cultural exchange, which is conducive to mutual understanding and trust between countries, and is also conducive to the struggle of various countries for peace and progress.

    The people of the countries of the great socialist camp provide a clear and convincing example of cultural exchange aimed at consolidating international friendship and defending world peace.

    苏联和人民民主国家之间的文化交流
    苏联对外文化协会主席  杰尼索夫
    苏联和各人民民主国家之间，已经形成了一种历史上从未见过的、新颖的和最高形式的国际关系。这种国际关系是建立在无产阶级国际主义原则，建立在大小各民族权利平等，建立在促进经济和文化合作及尊重民族独立与各国主权这些基础上的。社会主义制度为各国人民的友好合作与和平创造了一切必要的条件。
    各人民民主国家的劳动人民怀着热烈的愿望访问苏联，迫切地希望了解苏联的经济、政治和文化生活各方面的成就。
    约·维·斯大林在他的著作“苏联社会主义经济问题”中写道：
    “我们的外国同志们想知道，我们是怎样挣脱了资本主义的镣铐的，我们是怎样以社会主义精神来改造了全国经济的，我们是怎样达到了与农民建立友好关系的，我们是怎样使得我们这个不久以前还是贫弱的国家变成了富强的国家的，什么是集体农庄，为什么我们虽然生产资料已经公有化了，但还没有消灭商品生产、货币、贸易等等。他们想知道这一切以及其他许多东西，并不是简单地为了好奇，而是要向我们学习，并为了自己的国家来利用我们的经验。”
    苏联人民殷勤地招待各人民民主国家的来宾，这些来宾愿意亲眼看看苏联，了解它的成就，并和苏联人民交换一下经验。苏联人民及其机关、组织等给所有代表团以了解自己国家各方面生活的一切可能性，给他们以同各民族、各种职业和不同年龄的人会面和谈话的一切可能性。
    代表们深刻而全面地，并以最大的注意力去研究工业企业和农业企业，科学机关和学校，医院和疗养院，少先宫和少先队夏令营，工人和集体农庄庄员的住宅等等。总之，他们是非常注意地研究苏联人民各式各样的生活。他们愿意和谁会晤就可以自由地和谁会晤，可以在苏联报章上发表谈话或在无线电台上作广播，参加创造性的讨论会，特别是参加苏联对外文化协会各部门经常举行的和苏联作家协会、苏联作曲家协会、苏联建筑师协会等的讨论会。现在在苏联访问的有以李敷仁为首的中苏友好协会总会参观团，该团受到热烈的招待。
    工业和农业方面的革新者以自己的经验转告各人民民主国家的朋友们。苏维埃国家的劳动人民——工人和农民，文化工作者，企业和机关的职员，教授和大学生，教师和小学生，演员和艺术家们乐意地和这些朋友交换自己的知识和思想。在乌克兰苏维埃社会主义共和国的捷尔任斯基工厂中，来自中国和保加利亚的冶金工业的工作者正在日益提高自己的学识。
    应各种社会组织和国家机关的邀请而访问各人民民主国家的苏联各种代表团（如工会代表团，文化工作者代表团，妇女代表团，青年代表团和体育代表团等），对加强苏联和各人民民主国家之间的文化合作和友谊是起了重大作用的。
    很多的苏联代表团时常访问中国，波兰，德意志民主共和国，捷克斯洛伐克，罗马尼亚，匈牙利，保加利亚，阿尔巴尼亚等国，代表们研究了各人民民主共和国的经济和文化方面的成就，人民的日常生活和在各国历史上和文化上有价值的名胜古迹。他们在工人、农民、学生和大学生的会议上，以及群众大会上作报告，在专家会议上发表演说，向劳动人民介绍苏联、苏联的成就及其爱好和平的愿望，他们交换自己的知识和工作经验。例如，苏联代表团的代表、砖瓦工人沙甫留金，镟工贝科夫，纺织女工阿娜尼耶瓦和矿工费利莫诺夫等于一九四九年在匈牙利访问时，曾参加了匈牙利的生产合理化工作者会议。他们和匈牙利工人们交换了自己的斯大哈诺夫工作方法的经验。一九五二年苏联代表团代表、砖瓦工人科罗列夫在参加庆祝德苏友好协会成立五周年纪念时，和柏林及德意志民主共和国其他城市的建筑工人和工程师们会晤。科罗列夫在建筑现场上当场表演了自己的砌砖法，显示了高度的劳动生产效率，并帮助民主德国的青年工人们很快地提高了熟练程度。
    苏联代表团回到祖国以后，向劳动人民作报告，叙述了自己旅途中的印象。他们除了在报章杂志上发表文章以外，并且写了专册的书本，还在无线电广播中进行介绍。
    文学、科学和艺术的交流在苏联人民和各人民民主国家之间的文化合作方面，是具有重大意义的。苏联科学院图书馆和许多外国的科学机关建立了经常的联系。苏联科学院送给外国科学机关许多定期刊物和论文等。莫斯科国立列宁图书馆和其他科学机关在这方面起了很大的作用。
    苏联对外文化协会将苏联的杂志、报纸、科学图书、艺术作品和儿童文艺作品等送给各人民民主国家的图书馆，这些图书馆是隶属于促进各人民民主国家和苏联之间友好和文化交流的团体的。
    苏维埃组织、机关和个人也从各人民民主国家得到不少的科学图书和文艺作品。
    苏联人民对各人民民主国家的文艺显示了很大的兴趣。苏联出版局出版了大量的人民民主国家作家的书籍。例如，用十八种苏联民族语言出版了中国作家的书籍，波兰作家的书籍也出版了七百多万册，而捷克斯洛伐克作家的书籍则出版了五百多万册。
    各人民民主国家许多作家的优秀著作都会获得了斯大林奖金。
    各国科学界代表的代表会议是苏联和各人民民主国家之间文化合作的形式之一。一九五三年一月在布拉格举行的苏联和各人民民主国家农业科学工作者国际会议，是这方面的典型。参加这次代表会议的有：以苏联列宁农业科学院副院长奥尔斯汉斯基为首的苏联农业科学工作者代表团，波兰代表团，罗马尼亚代表团，匈牙利代表团和德意志民主共和国代表团等。
    代表会议讨论了农业科学方面的最重要的问题，与如何促进和平阵营各国科学机关间合作的问题。代表会议促使各人民民主国家更广泛地运用苏联农业科学方面的成果，并推广了各人民民主国家农业科学方面的成就。
    苏联文化团体接受各国对苏联友好和文化合作团体的邀请，在各人民民主国家内展开了活动，把剧团、艺术团和一部分演员派到这些国家去。莫斯科剧院、以依戈尔·莫依谢也夫为指导的苏联国立人民舞蹈团、苏军歌舞团，以阿·斯维施尼柯夫为指导的俄罗斯歌曲国家合唱团、皮雅特尼茨斯基国家俄罗斯人民合唱团、以谢尔盖·奥布拉兹卓夫为指导的国家中央木偶戏剧院、列宁格勒普希金话剧院、格鲁吉亚苏维埃社会主义共和国人民舞蹈艺术团等在不同时间内，访问了各人民民主国家。
    苏联人民以极大的兴趣关心各人民民主国家的艺术发展情况，他们亲切地接待人民民主国家的演员和音乐家。中国、阿尔巴尼亚、罗马尼亚、捷克斯洛伐克和其他国家的戏剧团体都曾经在苏联演出过。一九五三年一月，波兰波兹南城的歌剧团和玛佐夫舍歌舞团曾在莫斯科演出。苏联政府对波兰人民共和国的艺术家们表示了谢意。各兄弟共和国的文化代表在苏联不仅给苏联人民表演了自己的成绩，交流了自己的经验，同时也吸收了苏联的先进经验。在最近这几天中，朝鲜人民军歌舞团在莫斯科、列宁格勒等大城市中的演出，获得了很大的成就。
    苏联很多的音乐厅除了演奏萧邦、莫纽斯柯、德伏沙克、斯密坦那等的古典音乐以外，也演奏中国、朝鲜、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克等国作曲家们的现代音乐。苏联剧院正在上演中国、朝鲜、罗马尼亚、保加利亚等国的剧作家们的剧本。
    各人民民主国家和苏联对举行电影展览会已成为一种传统了，这些电影展览会对自由民族的电影艺术的力量和成就作了检阅。苏联电影在各人民民主国家的银幕上已有了极显著的地位。这些国家的电影工作者所摄制的电影也不断地在苏联放映。最近几年来，在苏联举行了中国、朝鲜、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、罗马尼亚电影展览会，并且也举行了德意志民主共和国的电影艺术工作者所摄制的影片展览会。不久以前，在苏联举行了第二届匈牙利电影展览会。在举行电影展览会的日子里，成千成万的莫斯科、列宁格勒、基辅、明斯克和其他苏联城市的观众们，看到了匈牙利最好的影片，他们也参观了显示匈牙利人民文化生活方面成就的展览会。在莫斯科的电影院和俱乐部里，观众曾会晤了匈牙利人民共和国电影工作者代表团的代表们。
    电影展览会标志着各人民民主国家之间的友好和文化合作的进一步巩固。
    在同样的标志下，苏联和各人民民主国家的运动员们组织了共同的表演。因此，一九五三年一月在莫斯科“迪纳莫”体育场举行了苏联、匈牙利和捷克斯洛伐克运动员的溜水舞蹈的表演赛。表演节目是以全体运动员参加表演的“朋友的圆舞”宣告结束的。
    苏联和各人民民主国家之间文化合作的内容，一般说来就是如此。
    以上的情况说明了，苏联人民和其他人民民主国家的人民在发展国际文化合作方面已形成了一条广阔的战线，并且他们深刻地体会到这种事业的重要性。
    苏联人民是发展国际文化交流的虔诚的维护者，而这种文化交流是有利于各国的互相了解和信任，同时也有利于各国为争取和平与进步而作的斗争的。
    伟大的社会主义阵营各国的人民，对旨在巩固国际友好和保卫世界和平的文化交流，提供了鲜明的、令人信服的典范。
