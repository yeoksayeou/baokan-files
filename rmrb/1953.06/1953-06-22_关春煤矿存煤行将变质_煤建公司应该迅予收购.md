    The Stored Coal at Guanchun Coal Mine is About to Deteriorate: The Coal Construction Company Should Acquire it Promptly

    Liao Xiangji writes: The Guanchun Coal Mine, a production organization of the People's Government of Ruyuan County, Guangdong Province, had approximately 2,000 tons of bituminous coal in storage at the end of last year. The Ruyuan County People's Government has repeatedly requested the Guangzhou Branch of the China Coal Industry Building Materials Company to purchase it through the Yuebei Administrative Office. The company reported this to the Central and Southern China District Company, and the Central and Southern China District Company replied that it "cannot be purchased." Later, I wrote a letter to the Changjiang Daily, explaining that if this coal is not purchased and processed in a timely manner, it will deteriorate, and the people's property will suffer significant losses. This letter was forwarded by the Changjiang Daily to the Central and Southern China District Company of the Coal Construction Company. They immediately notified the Guangzhou Branch to send personnel to "understand the situation" and "report to the District Company for approval." After testing, it was determined that this batch of stored coal contains 24 percent volatile matter and 23 percent ash; however, after reporting the above situation to the Central and Southern China District Company, no "approval" has been seen. In February of this year, the Production and Disposal Committee of the Guangdong Provincial People's Government again requested the Financial and Economic Committee of Guangdong Province to transfer the request to the Guangdong Branch of the Coal Construction Company (the Guangzhou Branch has been reorganized into the Guangdong Branch, directly under the leadership of the head office; the Central and Southern China District Company has been abolished) to find a way to purchase this batch of stored coal. The Provincial Company immediately reported to the head office for instructions, explaining that this batch of coal has been stored for too long and is about to deteriorate, so it should be disposed of as soon as possible. But the problem has not been resolved until now. On the other hand, Guangzhou City is currently short of coal with a high volatile matter content, and this batch of stored coal from the Guanchun Coal Mine is suitable for general glass factories, cigarette factories, and ships. Therefore, I believe that the Coal Construction Head Office should quickly approve the purchase of this batch of stored coal to avoid losses to state assets.

### 关春煤矿存煤行将变质  煤建公司应该迅予收购

专栏：读者来信摘要

    关春煤矿存煤行将变质 煤建公司应该迅予收购
    廖湘基来信：广东省乳源县人民政府的机关生产机构——关春煤矿在去年结束时，存有烟煤约二千吨。乳源县人民政府曾多次通过粤北行署请求中国煤业建筑器材公司广州分公司收购。该公司上报中南区公司，中南区公司批复说是“不能收购”。后来我把这一情况写信告知长江日报，说明这些煤如果不及时收购和处理，将会变质，人民财产将要遭受重大损失。这封信由长江日报转给煤建公司中南区公司。他们即通知广州分公司派员前往“了解情况”，“再报区公司批复”。经化验后断定，这批存煤含挥发物百分之二十四，灰份百分之二十三；但以上情况上报给中南区公司后始终未见“批复”。今年二月间广东省人民政府机关生产处理委员会又请求广东省财经委员会转请煤建公司广东分公司（广州分公司已改组为广东分公司，直接归总公司领导；中南区公司撤消）设法收购这批存煤。省公司即报请总公司批示，并说明这批煤因积存过久，行将变质，应该及早处理。但一直到现在问题还没有解决。另一方面，目前广州市缺乏含大量挥发物的用煤，关春煤矿这批存煤正适合一般玻璃厂、烟厂和轮船等应用。因此，我认为煤建总公司应该迅速批复收购这批存煤，以免国家财富遭受损失。
