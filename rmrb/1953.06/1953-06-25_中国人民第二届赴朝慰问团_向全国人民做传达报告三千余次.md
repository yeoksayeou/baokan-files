    Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: Since returning to China last December, the Second Chinese People's Delegation to Korea has been conducting outreach to major cities and many towns and villages throughout the country via sub-delegations and groups. Some representatives of the delegation also went deep into areas inhabited by fraternal ethnic groups, such as Gansu, Ningxia, the Kangzang Plateau, and the Yunnan border, to deliver their messages. According to incomplete statistics, the delegation gave a total of 3,364 reports to the people nationwide, with direct audiences totaling over 1,080,000 people. The delegation also visited the families of many heroes and martyrs, such as the Southwest sub-delegation's visit to the mother of martyr Huang Jiguang, the family of Miao youth combat hero Liu Xingwen, and the family of resourceful hero Yi Caixue.
    The delegation was warmly welcomed by people from all walks of life everywhere they went. In order to hear the delegation's report, many people did not hesitate to travel long distances. For example, many Tibetan brothers rode horses for four or five days to reach Qamdo.
    The great victory achieved by the just struggle of the Chinese and Korean people and the high degree of patriotism and internationalism of the Volunteer Army gave the people of the whole country great encouragement and education. After listening to the delegation's reports, people from all walks of life expressed their determination to learn from the Volunteer Army, actively engage in the industrial and agricultural construction of the great motherland, support the front, and ensure that preferential treatment work is done well and that the difficulties of military families and families of martyrs are resolved.

    中国人民第二届赴朝慰问团
    向全国人民做传达报告三千余次
    据新华社讯：中国人民第二届赴朝慰问团回国后，从去年十二月起即以分团和小组为单位，分赴全国各主要城市和许多村镇进行传达。慰问团一部分代表并曾深入到甘肃、宁夏、康藏高原和云南边境等兄弟民族聚居地区进行传达。据不完全统计，慰问团共向全国人民做传达报告三千三百六十四次，直接听众约一千零八十多万人。慰问团并访问了许多英雄和烈士的家属，如西南分团访问了黄继光烈士的母亲，访问了苗族青年战斗英雄刘兴文烈士的家属和智勇双全的英雄易才学的家属。
    慰问团到处受到各阶层人民的热烈欢迎。为了听取慰问团的报告，许多人不惜远道跋涉，如藏族兄弟就有不少人骑了四、五天马赶到昌都来。
    中朝人民的正义斗争所取得的伟大胜利和志愿军高度的爱国主义、国际主义的精神给了全国人民以极大的鼓舞和教育。各阶层人民在听了慰问团的传达报告之后，都纷纷表示要向志愿军学习，积极进行伟大祖国的工农业建设，支援前线；并保证作好优抚工作，解决军属和烈属的困难。
