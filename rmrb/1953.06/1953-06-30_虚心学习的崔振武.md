Cui Zhenwu, a Humble Learner
	Chang Yi, Cao Yaqing
	The name of this humble learner is Cui Zhenwu. He is the Communist Youth League Committee Secretary of the construction site of the seamless steel tube plant, one of the three major capital construction projects of Anshan Iron and Steel Company.
	A year ago, Cui Zhenwu left his familiar post in rural youth work and came to the construction site of the Anshan Iron and Steel seamless steel tube plant with excitement and a sense of honor. At that time, he thought, "I am participating in the economic construction of the motherland, and I must do this glorious job well!"
	However, there is always a distance between imagination and reality. When Cui Zhenwu first arrived in Anshan, he felt a little "overwhelmed" when he saw how complex and large the project was, with sixty types of workers working simultaneously. In addition, the workers came from all directions, and their ideological situations were complex, with many people not focused on their work. This made Cui Zhenwu even more anxious: How to implement the Party's intentions? How to understand the requirements of the project? How to understand the ideological situation of the masses? How to play the role of a League Committee Secretary? ... He often worried about these issues so much that he couldn't sleep.
	The Party Committee Secretary understood Cui Zhenwu's feelings and told him more than once: "If we want to do our job well, we must study hard, learn from practice, learn from the workers, learn basic construction knowledge, and transform ourselves from outsiders to insiders." At the same time, the Party Committee Secretary also told him that to do a good job in the work of young workers, it is first necessary to care about their lives and work, and be their friends. Later, Cui Zhenwu moved into the apprentice dormitory. At that time, the work of training skilled workers and apprentices had just begun. He helped the League branch with its work and listened to lectures with the apprentices, acting like an elementary school student.
	For forty days, Cui Zhenwu lived with the young workers, which made him deeply realize that many workers' work morale was unstable because their living conditions were too poor, many people could not get water, the food was hard, the beds were damp, and the houses leaked rain.... At this time, he remembered Chairman Mao's teachings in the article "Pay Attention to the Well-being of the Masses, Pay Attention to Methods of Work" and read this article to the League cadres. This helped everyone understand that only by caring about the lives of the masses can we mobilize the masses to do a good job in production and achieve the goal of educating the workers. His report to higher authorities on the living conditions of the workers was taken seriously by the leadership, and many urgent and solvable problems were resolved. Later, he also helped the League branch to start workers' recreational activities. Songs rang out in the workers' dormitory, Yangko teams and ball teams appeared on the open space next to the dormitory, and on Sundays, workers often marched to the suburbs for trips.
	At this time, Cui Zhenwu was already busy enough, but he still squeezed out time to read every night. He read "Technical Standards for Civil Engineering and Construction", he read booklets on the experience of the Soviet Youth League in economic construction, and he also read novels. The book "Time, Forward!" once helped him realize the importance of saving time for capital construction.
	Last September, a tense red flag competition was launched on the construction site. The Party's intention was clear: face the project and serve the project! The project's requirement was certain: complete 80% of the total project volume.
	"We started facing the project," Cui Zhenwu said, talking about a period of detours. He said: "The construction site was extremely lively. There was welding in the air, foundation work underground, and people coming and going in all directions. It was the first time I had seen such a large labor scene of 'parallel three-dimensional combined operations'. But what should I do here? Helping the workers carry things would hinder others' work. Helping to pull carts couldn't solve any problems. When I saw engineers and technicians, I followed the example of the Party Committee Secretary, greeted them, and asked, 'How is it going? Are there any problems?' Sometimes people enthusiastically talked a lot, but I still didn't understand. Several comrades in the League Committee studied together and felt that this way of 'facing the project' was not right. So we went to the Party Committee to ask for advice. The Party Committee Secretary instructed us to fundamentally understand the meaning of facing the project, such as what the task requires and what the key problems in the project are. This requires being familiar with the project and frequently attending administrative meetings."
	Cui Zhenwu did as the Party Committee instructed. He learned to read blueprints and grasped the daily progress of the project. At that time, the metal structure work could not be completed according to plan due to a shortage of skilled workers and tools, which hindered the progress of other work. This was the key problem in production. The administration set a deadline of seven days to complete the metal structure work, and the Anshan Metal Structure Engineering Company specially sent a "Youth Team" to support them. Cui Zhenwu helped the League branch immediately convene the original and newly arrived League members and young workers to discuss ways to solve this problem. A young worker proposed learning the Soviet short-arc welding method. This proposal was immediately supported by the League branch and everyone. As a result, the task was completed in four days. From then on, he realized that organizing League members and young people to learn from Soviet advanced experience and implement Soviet expert suggestions was very important for completing tasks.
	After learning from the experience of Factory 53, Cui Zhenwu understood the importance of doing a good job in ideological education, especially being good at keenly grasping typical examples among the masses for education. For example, he heard that the young welder Zhang Defu insisted on working in the rain, braving the heavy rain. When others asked Zhang Defu, "Why don't you wait for the rain to stop before working?" Zhang Defu answered readily, "If I complete the task one day earlier, other work can also be carried out faster, so the industrialization of the country will come one day sooner!" Cui Zhenwu praised Zhang Defu's advanced thinking to League members and young workers. This gave the young workers great education and boosted their production enthusiasm.
	In order to deeply understand the work of the League branches, Cui Zhenwu also suggested that each branch write a "Work Diary". In the diaries, he discovered many problems. A branch secretary once angrily recorded such an incident in his diary: The young worker Wang Yixiu found a knack for drilling frozen ground with a red-hot drill bit, which greatly improved work efficiency; however, the foreman said he was damaging the tools and prohibited the use of this knack. Another branch secretary told Cui Zhenwu, "I'm terribly busy working all day, and others still criticize me for departmentalism."
	Cui Zhenwu actively and tirelessly clarified these issues and helped them to solve them.
	Cui Zhenwu's work report has the following passage: "The project tasks were completed ten days ahead of schedule in September and twelve days ahead of schedule in October. By the end of November, the plan had been overfulfilled by 105%; 122 cadres above the team leader level were trained and transferred for the Party and administration; among the 29 labor models, 12 were League members and young people; 549 League members were developed..." This shows that their work has achieved certain results. However, Comrade Cui Zhenwu is not complacent. At the end of his conversation, he said modestly: "In our work, there are still many shortcomings, such as not paying enough attention to technical learning; not learning the experience of Factory 53 thoroughly enough; the collective leadership role of the League Committee is not发挥的well enough; and I personally still have many shortcomings. The tasks ahead are serious. We must actively study, earnestly overcome our shortcomings, and catch up with the development of the work."

    虚心学习的崔振武
    常毅、曹雅卿
    这位虚心学习的人的名字叫崔振武，他是鞍山钢铁公司三大基本建设工程之一——无缝钢管厂建筑工地的青年团委员会书记。
    一年前，崔振武离开了他熟习的农村青年工作的岗位，怀着兴奋的、荣耀的心情，来到鞍钢无缝钢管厂建筑工地。当时，他想：“这是参加祖国的经济建设，我一定要做好这个光荣的工作！”
    可是想像和实际总是有距离的。崔振武初到鞍山时，看到工程这样复杂、浩大，六十种工种的工人在同时工作，就感到有点“抓不住”，加上工人都是来自四面八方，思想情况复杂，许多人不安心工作。这样，崔振武更加发急：怎样贯彻党的意图？怎样了解工程要求？怎样了解群众思想情况？怎样发挥一个团委书记的作用呢？……他常为这些问题忧虑得睡不着觉。
    党委书记是理解崔振武的心情的，不只一次地对他说：“咱们要做好工作，就得顽强地学习，向实际学习，向工人学习，学习基本建设知识，变外行为内行。”同时，党委书记又告诉他要做好青年工人的工作，首先必须要关心他们的生活和工作，和他们做朋友。以后，崔振武就搬到徒工宿舍去住了。那时候，训练技术工人和徒工的工作刚刚开始。他就帮助团支部做工作，同时和徒工一起听课，当小学生。
    四十几天中，崔振武一直和青年工人生活在一起，使他深刻地认识到许多工人的工作情绪不安定是因为他们的生活条件太差，许多人吃不到水，饭食生硬，床铺潮湿，房子漏雨……。这时，他想起了毛主席在“关心群众生活，注意工作方法”一文中的教导，并翻出这篇文章读给团干部们听。使大家懂得只有关心群众生活，才能发动群众搞好生产，并且达到教育工人的目的。他向上级写的关于工人生活状况的报告得到了领导上的重视，许多迫切需要和可能解决的问题都得到解决了。后来他又帮助团支部把工人的文娱活动搞起来。工人宿舍里响起了歌声，宿舍旁边的空场上出现了秧歌队和球队，星期天工人们常常列队到郊外去旅行。
    这个时候，崔振武已经是够忙的了，但是他每天晚上还挤出时间来读书。他读“土木建筑技术标准”，他读苏联青年团在经济建设时期工作经验的小册子，他还读小说。“时间呀！前进”这本书曾经帮助他认识到争取时间对基本建设的重要。
    去年九月，工地上开展了紧张的红旗竞赛。党的意图是明确的：面向工程，为工程服务！工程要求是肯定的：完成全部工程量的百分之八十。
       “我们就开始面向工程了，”崔振武谈起走弯路的一段故事。他说：“工地热闹极了，高空是电焊，地下打基础，前后左右，人来人往，我还是第一次看到这种‘平行立体联合作业’的大劳动场面。可是在这里，我该干什么呢？帮助工人抬点东西吧，反碍了别人的事，帮助拉小车，也不能解决什么问题，见到工程师和技术员，我也学着党委书记的样子，打个招呼，问声：‘怎么样，有什么问题吗？’有时人家热情地讲了许多，我仍是不懂。团委几个同志在一起研究，都认为这样‘面向工程’不对头，于是我们又去找党委请教办法。党委书记指示我们要从根本上了解面向工程的意义，比如任务要求什么，工程中关键问题是什么。这就要熟习工程，经常参加行政的会议。”
    崔振武照着党委的指示做了。他学会了看图纸，掌握了每天工程的进度。当时，金属结构工作因为技工和工具的不足，任务不能按计划完成，并阻碍了其他工作不能进行，这便是生产中的关键问题。行政限期七天把金属结构工作做完，鞍钢金属结构工程公司特地派了“青年小组”来支援。崔振武帮助团支部立刻召集原来的和新到的团员和青年工人开会，研究解决这个问题的办法。一个青年工人提出学习苏联短弧焊接法，这个提议立刻得到团支部和大家的拥护，结果四天就完成了任务。从此，他体会到组织团员和青年学习苏联先进经验和执行苏联专家建议对完成任务有很重要的意义。
    在学习了五三工厂的经验后，崔振武懂得了做好思想教育工作的重要，特别是要善于敏锐地抓住群众中的典型事例来进行教育。比如：他听说青年电焊工人张德福，在下雨天，冒着大雨坚持工作。别人问张德福：“你为什么不等雨停下再干呢？”张德福答的很痛快：“我早一天完成任务，其他工作也好快点进行工作，这样国家工业化就早一天到来！”崔振武向团员和青工们表扬了张德福的这种先进思想。这给青年工人们很大的教育，鼓舞了他们的生产积极性。
    为了深入了解团支部的工作，崔振武还建议每个支部都写“工作日记”。在日记中，他发现了许多问题。一个支部书记曾经在日记上气愤地记载着这样一件事：青年工人王义修找到了用烧红的钻头来钻冻地的窍门，工作效率提高了许多；但是领工员却说他是破坏工具，禁止使用这个窍门。另一个支部书记告诉崔振武：“我工作一天忙的要命，别人还批评我闹本位主义。”
    这些问题，崔振武都积极地不怕麻烦地弄清情况，帮助他们来解决。
    崔振武的工作报告上有这样一段话：“九月提前十天，十月提前十二天完成工程任务，到十一月底就超额完成计划的百分之一百零五；为党和行政培养和输送了一百二十二名班组以上干部；在二十九名劳动模范中有十二名团员和青年；发展了五百四十九名团员。……”这说明他们的工作是有一定成绩的。但崔振武同志并不自满，在结束他的谈话时，他谦虚地说：“在我们的工作上，还有着许多缺点，比如对技术学习重视的还不够；对五三工厂经验学习的还不透；团委集体领导作用发挥的也较差；我个人的缺点也还不少。今后任务是严重的，必须积极学习，认真克服缺点，赶上工作的发展。”
