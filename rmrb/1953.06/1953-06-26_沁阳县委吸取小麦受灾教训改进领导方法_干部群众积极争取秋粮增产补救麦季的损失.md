The Qinyang County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Henan Province and the Qinyang County People's Government, when leading the masses to rescue and protect wheat this early summer, earnestly examined the problems existing in leading agricultural production and found the correct and effective way to lead agricultural production in the future.

After the frost disaster this spring, some grassroots cadres and masses once denied the necessity of leading agricultural production, denied the principle of "man can conquer nature," and denied advanced experience and science and technology; conservative ideas and the idea of relying on heaven for food rose. Some masses even complained, "If you listen to the government, you won't have anything to eat!" Why did the masses develop this kind of thinking after the disaster? This is related to the leadership at the county level. In the past, county-level cadres had many problems in leading agricultural production, which were all exposed after the frost disaster.

	1. In the past, attention was only paid to increasing production, but not to reducing costs. Especially in the leadership of agricultural production cooperatives, mutual aid groups, and labor models in key villages, costs were not scientifically calculated, and ways to increase production from various aspects (such as improving soil and cultivation methods) were ignored; when it came to increasing production, fertilizer was used indiscriminately; and attention was paid to fine fertilizer, while coarse fertilizer was neglected; and there was a lack of scientific and technological guidance in applying fine fertilizer, resulting in excessive investment in production and great waste in fertilization. For example, Zhang Yongqing, a provincial labor model from Jingming Village, applied 2,160 catties of fine fertilizer to his 20 mu of wheat this year, worth nearly 2 million yuan. The entire Xiaoshizhuang Village planted 510 mu of wheat land, and the two applications of soybean cake and sesame cake alone cost 14.74 million yuan. Therefore, after the frost disaster, some masses said, "If I hadn't listened to the government and applied so much fertilizer, even if I didn't harvest wheat, I could still eat for half a year."

	2. Ignoring regional and climatic differences, blindly promoting foreign experiences, and not paying attention to summarizing local experiences. This was even more prominent in the promotion of improved wheat varieties. Last year, some "Bamboo Pole Green" wheat seeds were obtained from Wushe County and awarded to labor models. This improved variety has strong frost resistance, but it is suitable for planting in sunny, sandy soil and should be planted late. Because its characteristics were not understood, it was blindly promoted, and many of the planted wheat froze to death last winter. There is a local "50 Wheat" improved variety that is strong in wind and fog resistance, has a large yield, and is of high quality, but it is very weak in frost resistance. The county's leading cadres did not conduct good research and summary of its advantages and disadvantages, and promoted it on 40% of the county's wheat field area; as a result, due to its weak frost resistance, coupled with poor soil fertility and poor management, many froze to death during this severe frost attack.

	3. Only paying attention to seasonal leadership in cultivation and fertilization, but not paying attention to long-term struggle against natural disasters; especially the struggle against disasters such as frost, fog, wind, and hail is even more lacking in awareness (more attention is paid to drought, waterlogging, and insect pests). There was no good leadership in preventing frost damage beforehand, and there was nothing to do afterward. In fact, disasters such as frost and fog can also be avoided or reduced; the problem is that the leading cadres have not paid attention to preventing frost and fog, and have not seriously studied the existing prevention methods among the masses and promoted them. At the same time, they have not led the masses to make material preparations for famine prevention. In recent years, the county's leadership has only paid attention to how to lead the masses to increase production, but has not paid attention to educating the masses to save and make necessary plans for famine prevention. When a disaster comes, there is no power to resist.

All of the above situations show that the county's leading organs lacked both scientific knowledge and practical experience in leading agricultural production in the past. They did not proceed from the characteristics of the small-scale peasant economy, but instead led blindly, subjectively, and one-sidedly. This makes it difficult to lead production well.

In order to learn from the lessons of the wheat disaster and improve future leadership, the Qinyang County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the County People's Government organized cadres and party members to earnestly study the relevant documents on rural work and agricultural production promulgated by the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party this spring, in order to overcome bureaucracy, subjectivism, and the commandism and general leadership style arising therefrom. At the same time, they organized cadres and masses to conduct wheat visits and comparisons, comprehensively analyzed the disaster situation, and summarized the experience of high yield, so that they recognized the importance of leading production and the superiority of advanced experience, overcame conservative thinking and the idea of relying on heaven for food, and established confidence in fighting against natural disasters. They also organized cadres to study science and technology, go deep into the base points, go deep into the production process, and summarize the existing and newly created experiences among the masses, in order to enrich the knowledge of leading production. In this way, the confidence of cadres and masses in overcoming disasters and striving for increased autumn grain production has been strengthened, and the enthusiasm for learning technology and finding ways to increase production is very high. Many cadres and masses said: Reduce losses in the wheat season, make up for them in the autumn season; if it doesn't work this year, we'll get it back next year! (Tian Tongjin)

    沁阳县委吸取小麦受灾教训改进领导方法
    干部群众积极争取秋粮增产补救麦季的损失
    中共河南省沁阳县委和沁阳县人民政府，在今年夏初领导群众进行救麦保麦的时候，认真检查了在领导农业生产上所存在的问题，找出了今后正确有效地领导农业生产的途径。
    今春霜灾发生后，一部分基层干部和群众曾经否认对农业生产进行领导的必要，否认“人定胜天”的道理，否认先进经验和科学技术；保守思想和靠天吃饭的思想抬头了。有的群众甚至瞒怨地说：“听上政府话，该你不吃啥！”为什么群众在遭灾以后会产生这种思想情绪呢？这是和县级的领导有关系的。过去县级干部在领导农业生产上存在着不少问题，在霜灾以后都暴露出来了。
    一、过去只注意提高生产，不注意降低成本。特别是对重点村的农业生产合作社、互助组及劳动模范的生产的领导，更是没有科学地计算成本，忽视从多方面（如改良土壤与耕作方法等）寻找增产的窍门；说到增产，就用肥料来壅；并且重视细肥，轻视粗肥；对施细肥又缺乏科学技术的指导，以致生产上投资过大，施肥上的浪费也很大。如景明村的省劳动模范张永清今年二十亩小麦即施细肥二千一百六十斤，价值近二百万元。小石庄全村共种五百一十亩麦地，仅施豆饼、麻饼两次就值一千四百七十四万元。因此，霜灾后有的群众就说：“我要不是听政府的话，上那样多的肥料，即使不收麦，也能吃半年。”
    二、不注意地区、气候的差别，盲目推广外来的经验，不注意总结本地的经验。这在推广小麦良种上表现得更为突出。去年从武涉县弄来一部分“竹杆青”麦种，奖给了劳动模范。这种良种抗霜能力强，但适宜于种植在有阳光的沙质土地上，并宜迟种。由于不了解它的特性就盲目推广，种的麦子去冬就冻死不少。本地有一种“五○麦”良种，抗风、抗雾力强，产量大，质量高，但抗霜力很弱。县的领导干部对它的优缺点没有很好地研究总结，就在全县百分之四十的麦田面积上推广；结果，由于抗霜力弱，加上地力薄弱，管理不好，这次严霜袭击时冻死很多。
    三、只注意季节性的耕作施肥方面的领导，不注意长期性的对自然灾害作斗争；特别对霜、雾、风、雹等灾害的斗争更缺乏自觉（对旱、水、虫灾等还比较注意）。对霜害事先没有很好的领导群众预防，事后又束手无策。其实，霜雾等灾害也是可以设法避免或减轻的；问题在于领导干部对预防霜雾等灾害没有重视，没有认真研究群众中已有的预防办法而加以推广。同时也没有领导群众在物质上作好防荒准备。几年来，县的领导方面只注意了怎样领导群众增产，却没有注意教育群众节约，作必要的防荒的打算。灾荒一来，无力抵抗。
    以上这些情况都说明了过去县的领导机关领导农业生产是既缺乏科学知识，又缺乏实际经验，不从小农经济的特点出发，而是盲目的、主观片面的领导。这就很难把生产领导得好。
    为了吸取小麦受灾的教训，以改进今后的领导，中共沁阳县委和县人民政府组织干部、党员认真学习了中共中央今春颁布的有关农村工作和农业生产的文件，以克服官僚主义、主观主义以及由此而产生的命令主义和一般化的领导作风。同时组织干部群众进行了小麦参观评比，全面地分析了受灾情况，总结了丰产经验，使他们认识领导生产的重要性和先进经验的优越性，克服保守思想和靠天吃饭思想，树立向自然灾害作斗争的信心。他们还组织干部学习科学技术，深入基点，深入生产过程，总结群众中已有的和新创造的经验，以丰富领导生产的知识。这样，干部和群众战胜灾害争取秋粮增产的信心加强了，学习技术、寻找增产窍门的情绪很高。不少干部和群众表示：麦季减收秋季补，今年不行明年捞！（田同锦）
