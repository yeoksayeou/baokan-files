    Soviet Oil Workers Set New Drilling Record
    [Xinhua News Agency Dispatch] According to the "Pravda" and "Labor News," the team of Sharif Fatkuliyev, a well-known team leader of the Burovnensky Drilling Bureau in Baku, has set a new drilling record in the Soviet Union. The team began drilling well No. 972, which is 1,792 meters deep, on May 9th, and completed it on the 19th. Relying on the rapid drilling method, the team enabled a machine to drill 5,432.6 meters per month, while the original quota was 2,542.9 meters, which is 220 meters higher than the record set by the Yaga Dadash team of the same engineering office a year ago. By promoting the working methods of many advanced workers, the Burovnensky Drilling Bureau has completed the task for the first half of this year ahead of schedule, and is now drilling oil wells above the plan.

    苏联石油工人创钻井新纪录
    【新华社讯】据真理报和劳动报报道，巴库布若夫宁凿井工程处著名领班夏里夫·法特库里耶夫的工作队，创造了全苏钻凿油井新纪录。这个工作队从五月九日开始钻凿第九七二号深达一千七百九十二公尺的油井，到十九日就完成了。工作队依靠快速钻井法，使一台机器每月钻进五千四百三十二点六公尺，而原来定额是二千五百四十二点九公尺，比该工程处亚加·达达什工作队一年前所创造的纪录还高二百二十公尺。布若夫宁凿井工程处由于推广许多先进工人的工作方法，已提前完成了今年上半年的任务，现在正超计划钻凿油井。
