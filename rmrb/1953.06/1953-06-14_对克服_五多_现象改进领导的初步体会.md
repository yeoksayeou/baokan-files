Preliminary Experiences in Improving Leadership to Overcome the "Five Excesses" Phenomenon
Zhang Bin, Secretary of the CPC Chuxian Prefectural Committee, Anhui

In order to improve leadership methods and style, and reduce the "five excesses" phenomenon in rural areas, the CPC Chuxian Prefectural Committee focused on Langya District and Langya Township in Chuxian County to conduct experimental work on improving leadership methods. In the process of this experimental work, we have the following preliminary experiences:

I. It is necessary to unify the understanding of cadres and clarify the central task, so that the "five excesses" problem can be gradually solved, and rural production work can form an overriding central task. This is an arduous working process and cannot be solved simply by holding a meeting. Initially, the CPC Chuxian Prefectural Committee and the Chuxian County Committee also convened heads of various departments three times to discuss the issue of improving leadership methods. Some comrades believed that "It is good to do this, and all work can be subordinate to the center, but what if the work of the departments is squeezed out?" Other comrades believed that "Even if the leadership at our level is improved, if the higher levels do not unify leadership, they will still ask for materials. If we fail to complete the tasks, we will be criticized, and even circulated for criticism...". As a result, some departments replaced official documents with letters; others called for materials by phone. Seven departments in Chuxian County once asked the lower levels for materials sixteen times in one day. The lower levels reflected: the total number of documents has decreased, but the materials requested are still a lot. The main reason for this phenomenon is that cadres have not clarified the relationship between departments and the whole, and have not clearly realized that departmental work can only be completed by subordinating to the central task. To change this situation, in addition to continuing to repeatedly explain to the leading personnel of the special zone and county-level departments the significance of departments subordinating to the whole, the main thing is to lead the department cadres to experiment in actual work, and educate them in the process of experimentation. The cadres of various departments in Langya District of Chuxian County clarified the above understanding in actual work.

II. All work must be carried out under the unified deployment and arrangement of the Party committee. When deploying work, the leadership should convene meetings of the heads of relevant departments to unify thinking, clarify policies, rank the work, and distinguish between those that must be done and completed on time; those that can be postponed; and those that can be reduced in scale or temporarily stopped. When Chuxian County implemented spring plowing and production as the overriding central task, after unified arrangement by the Party committee, it stopped building roads, postponed party rectification work, and reduced the illiteracy eradication plan; and combined the work of implementing the Marriage Law with production work, and all other departmental work also revolved around the production center. As a result, the center was clear and prominent, the work was energetic and powerful, and the effect was good.

At the same time, the leadership itself must also establish an overall perspective and strengthen the leadership of departmental work. It is necessary to frequently solicit the opinions of cadres in departmental work and help them solve difficulties in their work. For departmental work that must be completed with a time limit, on the principle of not affecting the central work, properly organize forces, arrange time, and resolutely and timely ensure the completion of tasks. In this way, the central work can be completed without squeezing out the departmental work. When Langya District of Chuxian County conducted key experiments, it made unified deployment and arrangement for the work of various departments and the central task. The various materials collected from the townships were uniformly sorted out and reported separately. In the past, seven people in the district were still too busy, but now only two people can solve the problem. Propaganda Committee member Wang Kaicheng said: "At the beginning, I was worried that the work of the department would be squeezed out, but now I am relieved." Youth League cadre Song Heng said: "In the past, it took ten or twenty days to go to one or two townships to understand the situation, but now, with unified arrangement and unified reporting, the situation of the Youth League in the whole district is generally known; other comrades can also help solve the practical problems of the Youth League work. The work of the department has not only not been squeezed out, but has been strengthened."

III. In order to ensure the implementation of the unified deployment and arrangement of the Party committee, and to overcome the chaotic phenomenon of each doing its own thing and dividing the forces, the following work must be done from top to bottom:

First, special zones, counties, and districts should establish rural production offices (Editor's note: The central task of the special zone, county, and district levels is to lead agricultural production, and there is no need to set up a permanent rural production office). Since Chuxian County established a production office on March 29, it has begun to correct the phenomenon of "shooting arrows in all directions." The practice is: all materials (including statistics) requested from below must first be checked and collected in the directly affiliated organs, and it is not allowed to move everything down; materials that cannot be collected in the county can only be collected by the department that needs the materials to send people to the lower levels. At the same time, when requesting materials and issuing instructions to the lower levels, the responsible persons of the Party and government must distinguish between the importance and urgency of the matter. In this way, many duplicate materials can be reduced from being requested from below, so that the cadres below will no longer be busy all day collecting materials, and can concentrate most of their energy on leading production work. After Langya District established a production office, there were many benefits. First of all, the forces were concentrated and the actions were unified, which greatly promoted production. Of the twenty-two cadres in the district, only three were left in the office to be responsible for liaison between the upper and lower levels and to solve daily affairs, and the remaining cadres were uniformly organized to go deep into the rural areas to lead production, which greatly promoted rural work. According to statistics, only nine mutual aid teams were rectified in the whole district in March, but in April, after the establishment of the office, one hundred and eleven mutual aid teams were rectified. At the same time, it also overcame the chaotic phenomenon of each doing its own thing and promoted the work of the departments. Secondly, it promoted democracy and promptly handled problems. Because the district head or the secretary of the CPC District Committee often left one person in the organ, they could often study the problems raised by the lower levels with the cadres of the office, and immediately answer those that could be answered, otherwise, they would ask the relevant departments at the higher level to solve them. In this way, it overcame the irresponsible style of dealing with the problems raised by the townships in a perfunctory or procrastinating manner in the past. The cadres of Shisanlidian Township and Huashan Township reflected: in the past, it took ten and a half months to reply to a request for instructions, but now they receive a reply the second day after writing a letter, and it will be easier to work in the future. At the same time, a normal study system has been established in the organs of the district, which has improved the political and policy level of the cadres. Some district and township cadres reflected: in the past, they were so busy that they were dizzy, and sometimes they were so busy that they didn't even have time to eat. How could they have time to study! This is great now.

Second, strictly control meetings. In the past, the phenomenon of too many meetings was very serious, which made the cadres and masses below exhausted. It not only hindered production, but also caused disharmony between the grass-roots cadres and their families due to delays in production, which affected the work mood of the cadres. To correct this phenomenon, meetings must be strictly controlled. Meetings of general departments at the special zone level must be approved by the responsible persons of the Party and government, and expanded meetings of cadres must be studied by the prefectural committee. The county and district levels also grasp the above spirit, and the departments properly arrange them so as not to hold meetings with overlapping content. Since this control, improvements have been obtained. Chuxian County held a total of six major meetings in March, totaling twenty days, with more than 1,000 participants; Langya District also held six meetings, totaling thirteen days; the townships held major meetings for four and a half days, and small meetings almost every day. But after strict control, the county only held three meetings and the district only held two township cadre meetings in April. The meetings were very short, but they all solved the problems. After the cadres of Langya Township returned to the township, they convened two production committees for one day. After the meeting, the representatives of each representative district were convened according to each representative district, and then the members distributed the information to the masses in their own areas. In this way, each member had a clear division of labor, and the work could be closely integrated. The cadres and the masses were very happy. Production Committee member Shi Songlin said: "In the past, I attended meetings for fifteen days a month, and production was not done well. The masses complained, and it delayed my own production, making me unable to go up and down. The masses were also tired. It took several reminders to get people to the meeting, but when they arrived at the meeting, they fought for the four corners to sit (the four corners are a good place to doze off); now there are fewer meetings, and the masses arrive as soon as they receive the notice."

Third, streamline official documents, overcome bureaucratism, and strengthen specific guidance work. In the past, various departments issued a lot of documents. The townships received an average of four documents per day, and up to eight documents at most. The township cadres were so busy collecting materials that they were overwhelmed. Some cadres couldn't stand it and asked to "quit". The reason for this phenomenon is mainly that the leadership's subjectivism and bureaucracy are at work. They do not understand the situation below and do not pay attention to the effect of issuing documents. To solve this problem, the leadership must first be determined to do it themselves and educate the cadres at any time. If various departments emphasize the importance of their work and request approval to issue the documents, they must grasp the following three principles to deal with them, namely: do not issue documents that can be issued or not; postpone issuing documents that are not needed temporarily; issue documents that have a guiding role for the work that must be done below.

At the same time, the responsible cadres of the special zone and county levels must strictly implement the audit and approval system. In March, Chuxian County issued 278 official documents from the county to the district, which was reduced to 24 in April, and 13 from the district to the township.

Finally, in order to minimize the "five excesses" phenomenon, leading cadres must personally go down to help with the work, so as to discover problems, solve problems, and prevent spontaneous flow and chaos. (Originally published in Shanghai Jiefang Daily)

    对克服“五多”现象改进领导的初步体会
    中共安徽滁县地委书记  张斌
    为了改进领导方法和领导作风，减少农村中的“五多”现象，中共滁县地方委员会曾以滁县瑯琊区及瑯琊乡为重点，进行改进领导方法的试验工作。在这一试验工作的过程中，我们有如下的初步体会：
    一、必须统一干部的认识，明确中心任务，“五多”问题才能逐步解决，农村生产工作才能形成压倒一切的中心任务。这是一个艰苦的工作过程，不是简单地开个会就能解决的。起初，中共滁县地方委员会和滁县县委会也曾召集所属各部门负责人开过三次会议，讨论改进领导方法的问题。有些同志认为：“这样做好是好，一切工作能服从中心，可是部门工作被挤掉了怎么办？”另有些同志认为：“我们这一级的领导改进了，但上级不统一领导，还是照样要材料，完不成任务要受批评，甚至还要通报批评……”。于是，有的部门就以写信的方式代替公文；有的部门打电话要材料。滁县有七个部门曾经在一天内向下边要材料十六次。下边反映：总的文件少了，但要的材料还不少。产生这种现象主要是干部对部门与整体的关系没搞清楚，没有明确地认识到只有服从中心任务，才能完成部门工作的道理。要改变这种状态，除了继续向专区和县级各部门领导人员反复讲解部门必须服从整体的意义外，主要的还是带领部门干部到实际工作中去实验，在实验过程中教育干部。滁县瑯琊区各部门干部就是在实际工作中明确了上述认识的。
    二、一切工作必须在党委的统一布置和安排下进行。在布置工作时，领导上应召开各有关部门负责人会议，统一思想，明确政策，将工作进行排队，分清那些是必须做而且要按时完成的；那些是可以推迟的；那些是可以缩小计划或可暂时停止的。滁县在执行春耕生产为压倒一切的中心任务时，经过党委的统一安排后，即停止修筑公路，推迟整党工作，缩小扫除文盲计划；并把贯彻婚姻法工作结合生产工作来进行，其他一切部门工作也都围绕着生产中心来进行。结果，中心明确、突出，工作劲头足、力量大，成效也好。
    同时，领导本身也必须树立全面观点，加强对部门工作的领导。经常征求部门工作干部的意见，帮助他们解决工作上的困难。对带有时间性的必须完成的部门工作，要在不影响中心工作之原则下，妥当地组织力量，安排时间，坚决适时地保证完成任务。这样，既能完成中心工作，又不挤掉部门工作。滁县瑯琊区进行重点试验时，把各部门工作和中心任务作了统一的布置和安排。从各乡收集来的各项材料统一整理，分头上报。过去区里留七个人还忙不过来，现在只要两个人就能解决问题。宣传委员王开成说：“开始时我担心部门工作会被挤掉，现在放心了。”青年团干部宋恒说：“过去花了一二十天工夫，只能到一两个乡里去了解情况，现在统一安排，统一汇报，全区青年团的情况大体上都知道了；其他同志还能帮助解决青年团工作的实际问题。部门工作不但没有被挤掉，反而加强了。”
    三、为保证党委统一布置和安排的贯彻执行，以克服各自为政、分兵把口的混乱现象，必须自上而下地做好下列工作：
    第一、专区、县、区成立农村生产办公室（编者按：专区、县、区三级的中心任务就是领导农业生产，无需再设农村生产办公室常设机构）。滁县自三月二十九日成立了生产办公室后，开始纠正了“乱箭齐发”的现象。其做法是：凡是向下边要材料
    （包括统计），必须先在直属机关中查对收集，不许一概往下搬；县里无法收集的材料，才由需要材料的部门派人到下边收集。同时向下要材料，发指示，须由党、政负责人分清轻重缓急办理。这样，可减少向下面要许多重复的材料，使下面干部不再为了收集材料而终日忙乱不堪，可以把大部精力集中在领导生产工作上去，瑯琊区成立了生产办公室后，有很多好处，首先是力量集中，行动统一，因而大大地推动了生产。全区二十二个干部，只留三个人在办公室里，负责上下联系，解决日常事务问题，其余干部都统一组织起来，深入农村领导生产，大大地推动了农村工作。据统计：全区在三月份仅整顿九个互助组，但在办公室成立后的四月份中，便整顿了一百十一个互助组。同时也克服了各自为政的混乱现象，推动了部门工作。其次，发扬了民主，及时处理了问题。因为区长或中共区委书记经常留一人在机关里，能够经常和办公室的干部共同研究下边提出的问题，能答复的立即答复，否则，即请示上级各有关部门解决。这样，克服了以往对乡里提出的问题处理得很马虎或拖拉等不负责任的作风。十三里店乡和花山乡的干部反映：过去请示问题，十天半个月也不答复，现在第一天写信问，第二天就得到答复，今后工作也比较好做了。同时，区的机关里开始建立了正常的学习制度，提高了干部的政治水平和政策水平，有些区乡干部反映：过去忙得头昏脑胀，有时忙得连饭也顾不上吃，那有时间学习呢！这下子可好了。
    第二、严格控制会议。过去会议多的现象非常严重，使下边干部群众疲于奔命，不仅妨碍了生产，而且因耽误生产而造成基层干部和家庭间的不团结现象，影响了干部的工作情绪。要纠正这种现象，必须严格控制会议。专区级一般部门会议须经党政负责人批准，干部扩大会议须经地委研究。县区两级也掌握以上精神，部门间适当的安排好，不开内容重复的会议。自这样控制后，已获得了改进。滁县三月份共召开六次大会，共二十天，参加会议的有一千多人；瑯琊区也开了六次会，共十三天；各乡开大会四天半，小型会议差不多每天都有。但经过了严格的控制后，四月份县里只开会议三次，区只开二次乡干部会议，会议时间很短，但都解决了问题。瑯琊乡干部回乡后，召开了两次生产委员会，时间一天。会后，按各代表区召集代表区委员传达，然后再由委员分头向自己所在地的群众传达。这样，各委员都明确分工，工作又能密切结合起来，干部和群众都很高兴，生产委员史松林说：“过去一月开十五天会，生产没搞好，群众埋怨，耽误了自己的生产，弄得上不来下不去。群众也疲沓了，开一次会要催好几遍，人还到不齐，但到了会场就争四角坐（四角是打瞌睡的好地方）；现在会议少了，群众接到通知就到。”
    第三、精简公文，克服文牍主义，加强具体指导工作。过去各部门文件发得很多，乡里每天平均收到四件，最多时有八件，乡干部为了搞材料而忙得焦头烂额。有的干部实在受不住，要求“不干”。产生这种现象的原因，主要是领导上主观主义、官僚主义在作怪，不了解下情，不注意发文的效果。要解决这个问题，首先领导上要下决心亲自动手，随时教育干部。假如各部门各自强调工作重要，要求批准把文件发下去，这时，必须掌握以下三个原则来处理，即：可发可不发的文件不发；暂时不需要的缓发；对工作有指导作用的必须要下边办的即发下去。
    同时，专区和县级的负责干部要严格执行审核批准制度。滁县三月份由县发到区的公文二百七十八件，四月份便减少到二十四件，区发到乡十三件。
    最后，为了尽量减少“五多”现象，领导干部要亲自下去帮助工作，以便发现问题，解决问题，防止自流和混乱。（原载上海解放日报）
