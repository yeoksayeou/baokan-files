Xinhua News Agency, 1st dispatch: According to TASS news: Technician D. Ryzhkov of the Gorky City Machinery Factory in the Soviet Union, recently invented a vibration eliminator to eliminate the vibration of the tool and tool post during high-speed cutting operations, which has made a great contribution to further exploiting the production potential of lathes. According to recent test results at the factory, this simple device can more than double the toughness of the tool. It not only greatly reduces the wear and tear of the lathe, but also greatly improves the smoothness of the machined surface of the workpiece and improves the accuracy of the operation itself. At the same time, the labor productivity of lathe operators has also increased significantly after using this device. For example, lathe operator Kalersky increased the boring speed several times after eliminating tool vibration. When young lathe operator Mosin was processing a batch of parts, he installed a vibration eliminator and increased the lathe speed from 600 revolutions per minute to 1,020 revolutions per minute, completing 180% of the quota, and the product quality was excellent.
　　
Ryzhkov is an outstanding innovator. In the ten years he has worked in the factory, he has put forward a total of 150 rationalization proposals for technical improvements and inventions. When he entered the factory in 1934, he only had a primary school education. However, he continued to study in the factory for four years without leaving production, which greatly improved his cultural and technical level. After graduating from the night school of metal cold processing technology, he has been studying the problem of high-speed metal cutting methods. After the successful trial of the vibration eliminator, Ryzhkov was invited to the conference of the Institute of Machine Principles of the Soviet Academy of Sciences to make two reports on the experience of using this new device, and tested the function of the new equipment in front of scientists. At present, this device has been promoted throughout the Soviet Union.

    发明车刀振动消除器提高车床生产效率
    【新华社一日讯】据塔斯社消息：苏联高尔基城机械工厂技术人员德·雷日科夫，最近发明了一种消除高速切削操作过程中车刀和刀架振动的振动消除器，在进一步利用车床生产潜力方面贡献很大。根据最近该厂试验结果，这种结构简单的装置，可以使车刀的坚韧性提高一倍多。它不仅大大地减轻了车床的磨损，而且还大大地改善了制件加工面的光洁度，提高了操作本身的精确度。同时，在利用这种装置后，车工的劳动生产率也显著提高了。例如，车工卡莱尔斯基在消除车刀振动后，就把镗制的速度提高了好几倍。青年车工摩辛在加工一批制件时由于装置了振动消除器，把车床速度由每分钟六百转提高到一千零二十转，完成了定额百分之一百八十，而且产品质量都极为优良。
    雷日科夫是一个优秀的革新家。他在进工厂中工作的十多年内共提出了一百五十件关于技术改良和发明的合理化建议。当他在一九三四年进工厂时，只有初小的文化程度。可是他在工厂中不脱离生产地连续学习了四年，大大提高了文化和技术水平。他在金属冷处理技术夜校毕业以后，一直钻研高速金属切削法方面的问题。振动消除器试验成功后，雷日科夫被邀到苏联科学院机器原理研究所的会议上作了两次关于使用这种新装置的经验的报告，并在科学家面前实验了新设备的功能。目前这种装置已在苏联各地推广。
