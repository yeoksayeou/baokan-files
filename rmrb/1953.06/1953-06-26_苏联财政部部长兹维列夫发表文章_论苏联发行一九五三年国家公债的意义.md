Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, June 24th: Soviet Minister of Finance Arseny Zverev published an article on the Soviet Union's issuance of the 1953 National Bonds for the Development of the Soviet National Economy, saying that the purpose of issuing the bonds is to absorb residents' funds and help implement various measures of the Fifth Five-Year Plan. These funds will be used to further develop the socialist economy and improve the people's material welfare and culture. The issuance of these bonds opens up another source of funding for the construction of new factories, schools, and residential buildings.

Zverev then said that the total amount of bonds issued this year is 15 billion rubles, 50 percent less than in 1952. This is due to the continuous increase in cash accumulation in the socialist economy. This accumulation is the main part of the Soviet state budget revenue. Therefore, the government believes that it is appropriate to greatly reduce the use of bonds to absorb residents' funds as budget revenue.

Zverev pointed out that the basis for the increase in income in socialist countries is the development of the entire Soviet national economy, the increase in labor productivity, and the reduction in production costs. In 1952, Soviet industrial output increased by 11 percent compared to 1951. Grain and industrial crops had bumper harvests, and livestock production also increased. The growth of national income is an important indicator of the achievements of social production and the improvement of the people's material welfare. In 1951, the Soviet national income increased by 83 percent compared to the pre-war year of 1940, and in 1952, it increased by more than 11 percent compared to 1951.

The Soviet national income belongs entirely to the working people. In 1952, as in previous years, the funds obtained by the working people to meet their personal material and cultural needs accounted for about 75 percent of the national income. The remaining part of the national income is used to expand socialist production and meet other needs of the state and society. Recently, the Soviet government has taken special measures to greatly increase the production and sales of manufactured goods and food beyond the original plan. Industries producing consumer goods, especially light industry and the food industry, local industries, and cooperative industries, have been given additional tasks to increase the quantity and quality of goods and increase the variety of goods. Increasing the production of consumer goods and gradually reducing the retail prices of consumer goods can ensure the continuous improvement of purchasing power and the stability of the Soviet ruble. Gradually reducing prices greatly helps to improve the people's living standards.

Zverev continued: The Fifth Five-Year Plan stipulates further increases in the actual wages of residents. If the reduction in retail prices is taken into account, then the actual wages of workers and staff will increase by at least 35 percent, and the cash and in-kind income of collective farmers will increase by at least 40 percent.

At the same time, the increase in national income makes it possible to obtain more budget appropriations for expanding production, housing construction, and developing education and public health.

Zverev said that national bonds are another source of revenue for the Soviet state budget. Soviet national bonds contribute to the completion of economic and cultural development plans and the consolidation of the strength of the Soviet state. At the same time, national bonds are also of great benefit to national bondholders. In 1952, the laboring people received a total of 6.8 billion rubles in lottery winnings from national bonds. In 1953, 24 national bond lotteries will be held, and 9.8 billion rubles in lottery winnings will be paid out.

Zverev concluded by writing that the Soviet government unswervingly implements a policy of safeguarding and consolidating peace, strengthening international cooperation, expanding relations with all countries, and allocating huge budget funds for developing the national economy and improving the material welfare and culture of the working people.

    论苏联发行一九五三年国家公债的意义
    【新华社二十五日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科二十四日讯：苏联财政部部长阿辛尼·兹维列夫就苏联发行一九五三年发展苏联国民经济国家公债事发表文章说：发行公债的目的是为了吸收居民的资金，帮助第五个五年计划的各项措施的实行。这些资金将用来进一步发展社会主义经济，提高人民的物质福利和文化。这次发行的公债为建筑新的工厂、学校和住宅开辟了另一个经费来源。
    兹维列夫接着说：今年公债发行的总额是一百五十亿卢布，比一九五二年少百分之五十。这是由于社会主义经济中现金积累不断增加的缘故。这种积累是苏联国家预算收入的主要部分。因此，政府认为大大削减利用公债方式吸收居民的资金作为预算的收入，是适当的。
    兹维列夫指出：社会主义国家收入增加的基础，是苏联整个国民经济的发展、劳动生产率的提高和生产成本的减低。在一九五二年，苏联工业产量比一九五一年增加了百分之十一。谷物和工业作物获得了丰收，饲畜业产量也提高了。国民收入的增长是证明社会生产的成就和人民物质福利水平提高的重要指标。一九五一年，苏联国民收入比战前一九四○年增加了百分之八十三，一九五二年又比一九五一年增加了百分之十一以上。
    苏联的国民收入全部属于劳动人民。一九五二年和前几年一样，劳动人民所获得的用来满足个人物质和文化需要的款项，约占国民收入的百分之七十五。国民收入的剩余部分用来扩大社会主义生产和满足国家和社会的其他需要。最近，苏联政府采取了一些特别措施，要超过原定计划大大提高制成品及粮食的产量和销售量。生产消费品的工业，首先是轻工业和食品工业、地方工业和合作社工业，已规定了提高货物的产量和质量及增加货物的种类的额外任务。提高消费品产量，有步骤地减低消费品的零售价格，可以保证购买力的不断提高和苏联卢布的稳定。有步骤地减低物价，大大有助于提高人民的生活水平。
    兹维列夫继续说：第五个五年计划规定进一步提高居民的实际工资。如果把零售价格的减低计算进去，那末职工的实际工资至少将增加百分之三十五，集体农民现金和实物收入至少将增加百分之四十。
    同时，国民收入的增加使得扩大生产、住宅建筑以及发展教育和公共卫生方面，可以得到更多的预算拨款。
    兹维列夫说：国家公债是苏联国家预算收入的另一个来源。苏联公债有助于经济和文化发展计划的完成及苏维埃国家力量的巩固。同时，国家公债对公债券持有人也有很大的利益。一九五二年，劳动人民从国家公债中得到的中签奖金共有六十八亿卢布。一九五三年，将举行二十四次国家公债抽签，并将付出九十八亿卢布的中签奖金。
    兹维列夫最后写道：苏联政府始终不渝地执行维护和巩固和平的政策，加强国际合作，扩大和所有国家事务关系的政策，并为发展国民经济和增进劳动人民物质福利和文化，拨出了巨额的预算款项。
