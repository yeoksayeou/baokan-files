Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, June 25th: This correspondent reports: Today marks the beginning of the fourth year of the Korean War. The Korean armistice, which originally had the hope of being quickly realized, is facing serious threats. At a memorial meeting held in Pyongyang yesterday, representatives of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers unanimously expressed their firm will to strive for a Korean armistice and a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. However, in Seoul, Syngman Rhee, the scum of the Korean nation, shouted "Continue fighting, eliminate the enemy, until we fight to the last person."

Syngman Rhee's sinful activities to undermine the armistice did not start today. However, with the connivance of the US government, these activities are increasingly constituting an extremely critical and unprecedentedly serious threat to the armistice. The Korean armistice agreement, which only awaits the signatures of Marshal Kim Il-sung, General Peng Dehuai, and Clark, is in danger of becoming a scrap of paper.

More than a month ago, Syngman Rhee launched "anti-armistice demonstrations" in Seoul, Busan, and other cities in South Korea. At the same time, his parliament passed a resolution to "release on the spot" all prisoners of war. The US side did not stop this dangerous trend, which was already visible at the time. As a result, despite the agreement on the repatriation of prisoners of war being signed, just ten days after the signing of this agreement, Syngman Rhee broke the agreement and ordered the "release" of more than 27,000 captured personnel of the Korean People's Army, and successively forced them into the South Korean puppet army. Since then, the situation has taken a sharp turn for the worse, with Syngman Rhee shouting and yelling, "No armistice," "Go it alone," and "Fight to the Yalu River."

In the past few days, Syngman Rhee has repeatedly threatened that if the armistice agreement is signed according to the current terms, he will withdraw his troops from the jurisdiction of the United Nations Command and fight alone. Syngman Rhee declared that he would only agree to an armistice if the terms of the armistice agreement, which only awaits signature, are revised. But his so-called "revision" is nothing more than modifying the armistice agreement to become a tool for him to launch another war. Syngman Rhee demanded: "(1) Korea and the United States should first sign a mutual defense treaty, and then the United Nations forces and Chinese troops should withdraw simultaneously; (2) The term of the political conference should be limited to three months, and if no satisfactory results are achieved by the end of the term, the armistice will be considered terminated." Only if these two demands are met will he agree to an armistice; otherwise, he will "continue to fight alone." In fact, whether Syngman Rhee's demands are agreed to or not, the result is the same: there is no armistice in Korea. Because the issue of withdrawing all foreign troops from Korea was originally one of the agenda items of the political conference to be held after the armistice as stipulated in the armistice agreement, and the Korean-Chinese side has always advocated the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea after the armistice. Syngman Rhee's demand for the withdrawal of all foreign troops before the armistice is aimed at allowing him to continue fighting. He dares to continue fighting because he has a US-South Korea "mutual defense treaty." According to Syngman Rhee, with this treaty, whenever a war occurs, "the United States will assist us as before." That is to say, when Syngman Rhee launches another war, the US troops and the Syngman Rhee puppet army will invade North Korea together. Syngman Rhee seems to agree to convene a political conference to peacefully resolve the Korean issue on the surface, but today in Seoul he declared: "We cannot obtain at the conference table what we have not obtained on the battlefield." That is to say, Syngman Rhee is still determined to use war to achieve his goal of "unifying Korea." The so-called political conference being limited to three months to achieve results, otherwise the armistice will be terminated, is also intended for this purpose. In fact, Syngman Rhee is currently stepping up preparations to "continue fighting." He has ordered the conscription of all South Korean youths aged nineteen to twenty-seven into the army, and is stepping up the incorporation of the "released" prisoners of war into the South Korean puppet army so that he can quickly assemble a force of twenty-two divisions, which is the goal of the US plan to arm the Syngman Rhee puppet army.

All this shows that Syngman Rhee, who launched the war three years ago today under the instigation of the United States, is now making a desperate struggle to continue pursuing "unification of Korea by force." The US government did not stop Syngman Rhee from violating the prisoner of war agreement in advance, nor did it order him to return the "released" prisoners of war afterward. Moreover, Eisenhower also replied to him by concluding a "mutual defense treaty," which encouraged Syngman Rhee to increasingly challenge the people of the world who yearn for an armistice in Korea. Today, he said arrogantly in Seoul: "What we ask is: let us have the opportunity to continue fighting, even if we fight alone."

Syngman Rhee was brought from the United States to Korea and fostered there single-handedly by the US government. Syngman Rhee's series of actions to undermine the armistice have also become increasingly rampant with the connivance of the US government, and he has become a mad enemy of peace in Korea. The question now facing the US government is: will it continue to condone Syngman Rhee in implementing his sabotage plan, thereby continuing the Korean War? Or will it take action to ensure that the Korean armistice is realized? The whole world is watching whether the United States will give a responsible and satisfactory reply to the letter from Marshal Kim Il-sung and General Peng Dehuai.

### 李承晚已成为朝鲜和平的疯狂的敌人  在美国政府纵容下他的罪恶活动日益猖狂起来

    李承晚已成为朝鲜和平的疯狂的敌人
    在美国政府纵容下他的罪恶活动日益猖狂起来
    【新华社开城二十五日电】本社特派记者报道：今天，朝鲜战争开始进入第四年。原来有希望迅速实现的朝鲜停战正受到严重的威胁。昨天在平壤举行的一个纪念会上，朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军的代表都一致表示了他们争取朝鲜停战及朝鲜问题和平解决的坚强意志，但是在汉城，朝鲜民族的败类李承晚则叫喊着“继续打下去，消灭敌人，直到我们战斗到最后一个人”。
    李承晚破坏停战的罪恶活动不是今天才开始。然而，在美国政府的纵容下，这种活动正日甚一日地构成对停战的极端危急和空前严重的威胁。只待金日成元帅、彭德怀将军和克拉克签字的朝鲜停战协定有变成废纸的危险。
    一个多月以前，李承晚就在汉城、釜山及南朝鲜的其他城市发动了“反停战示威”，同时他的议会通过了要“就地释放”全部战俘的决议。美国方面并没有制止这个在当时已经可以看出的危险的趋势，于是，尽管关于战俘遣返问题的协议签订了，就在这个协议签订后十天，李承晚就破坏协议，下令“释放”二万七千名以上的朝鲜人民军被俘人员，并陆续把他们强编到南朝鲜伪军中去。从此局势急转直下，李承晚大喊大叫，“不要停战”，“单独干下去”，“打到鸭绿江”。
    在过去几天中，李承晚一再扬言：如果停战协定照目前的条款签订，他就把他的军队从联合国军司令部的管辖下撤出来，单独打下去。李承晚声言要修改那个只待签字的停战协定的条款才同意停战。但是他所说的“修改”，只不过是要把停战协定修改得成为他再度发动战争的工具而已。李承晚要求：“（一）朝鲜与美国先行签订共同防御条约，然后联合国军和中国军队同时撤退；（二）把政治会议的期限定为三个月，如果到期限满时还没有获致令人满意的结果，停战就被认为终止。”只有这两点要求得到实现，他才同意停战，否则，他就“继续单独打下去”。实际上，同意与不同意李承晚的要求，其结果都是一样：朝鲜没有停战。因为，关于撤退在朝鲜的一切外国军队问题，本来是停战协定中规定的停战后召开的政治会议的议程之一，朝中方面一直都主张停战后一切外国军队从朝鲜撤退。李承晚要求在停战前撤退一切外国军队，其目的是好让他继续打下去。他所以敢于继续打下去，是因为他有一个美李“共同防御条约”。照李承晚的说法，有了这个条约，不论何时发生战争，“美国将像以前那样援助我们”。就是说，当李承晚再度发动战争时，美国军队和李承晚伪军一起向北朝鲜进犯。李承晚表面上似乎同意召开政治会议和平解决朝鲜问题，但是，他今天在汉城就宣布：“我们不可能在会议桌上获得我们在战场上未曾得到的东西”。就是说，李承晚仍然决心要用战争来达到他“统一朝鲜”的目的。所谓政治会议限期三个月获得结果，否则停战就要终止云云，其用意也就在这里。事实上李承晚目前已在加紧准备“继续打下去。”他已下令把南朝鲜的所有十九岁到二十七岁的青年征召入伍，并加紧把“释放”的战俘编入南朝鲜伪军中去，以便很快能够凑足二十二个师的兵力，这是美国计划武装李承晚伪军的目标。
    这一切表明，三年前今天在美国指使下发动战争的李承晚现在正为继续追求“武力统一朝鲜”而作疯狂的挣扎。美国政府事先没有制止李承晚破坏战俘协议，事后也没有命令他交回被“释放”的战俘，而且艾森豪威尔还答复和他订立“共同防御条约”，这一切就鼓励了李承晚越来越嚣张地向全世界渴望朝鲜停战的人们挑战。今天他在汉城狂妄地说：“我们所要求的是：让我们有机会继续作战，即便是由我们自己单独作战也行。”
    李承晚是美国政府一手从美国搬到朝鲜去并在那里一手扶植起来的。李承晚一连串的破坏停战行动也是在美国政府的纵容下日益猖狂起来的，他已成为朝鲜和平的疯狂的敌人。现在摆在美国政府面前的问题是：究竟它是继续纵容李承晚一一实现他的破坏计划，从而使朝鲜战争继续下去呢？还是采取行动来保证朝鲜停战得以实现呢？全世界都注视着美国是否对金日成元帅和彭德怀将军的信作出负责的满意的答复。
