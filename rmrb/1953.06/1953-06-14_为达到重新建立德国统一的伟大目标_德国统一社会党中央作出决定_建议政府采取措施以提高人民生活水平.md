Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, June 13th: According to a report by the German News Agency on June 11th: The Politburo of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany decided at its meeting on June 9th to recommend that the government of the German Democratic Republic take several measures to improve the living standards of all the people and strengthen the laws of the republic.

The meeting's communique stated: The Politburo of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany believes that the Socialist Unity Party and the government of the German Democratic Republic have made several mistakes in the past. These mistakes are manifested in: the decisions regarding the readjustment of food ration cards and the confiscation of wasteland, as well as in some special measures taken by the state purchasing departments and strict taxation systems, etc. The Party and the government did not take into account the interests of individual farmers, small vendors, handicraftsmen, and intellectuals. Moreover, the states, special districts, and local areas committed serious errors in implementing the above decisions and regulations, resulting in many people leaving the republic.

The measures now being taken by the Politburo are to achieve the great goal of re-establishing German unity, in order to facilitate the rapprochement between East and West Germany.

The Politburo of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party believes that it is necessary to take a series of measures in the near future, while revising the plan for heavy industry, to correct past mistakes and improve the living standards of workers, farmers, intellectuals, handicraftsmen, and other strata of people. The Politburo's meeting on June 9th also made decisions regarding trade and supply, agriculture, and measures to facilitate transportation between the German Democratic Republic and West Germany. In order to increase the production of consumer goods and expand the trade network, the Politburo also put forward suggestions on granting short-term loans to handicraftsmen, small vendors, wholesale merchants, private industries, construction and transportation enterprises on a broad basis.

If shop owners who have recently closed down or abandoned their shops are willing to reopen, their wishes will be immediately considered. In addition, state trading organizations will sign contracts with private small vendors in order to better supply the people's living needs. The Politburo also recommended that the decision to confiscate wasteland be revoked; the controls imposed on farmers who owe taxes and cannot pay products in full be abolished.

Farmers (small farmers, middle farmers, and rich farmers) who have rented out their land due to difficulties in operating their fields and have fled to West Berlin or West Germany should be given the opportunity to return to their own estates. If this is not possible in exceptional circumstances, they should be given full compensation, loans, and assistance to obtain farm tools and livestock so that they can operate the fields.

The Politburo has advised the Minister of Agriculture and Forestry to take the necessary measures to ensure the interests of agricultural production cooperatives.

For all those who left the German Democratic Republic and fled, and then returned to the democratic republic or the democratic sector of Berlin, the Politburo recommends that their original property be returned to them, which was confiscated according to the decision of July 17, 1952. If this cannot be done in individual cases, compensation must also be given. Those who return to the German Democratic Republic should not be punished. The district and local councils and relevant authorities should help them find suitable work, enable them to participate in economic and social life, and obtain full civil rights (identity cards, food ration cards, etc.).

The Politburo believes that it is necessary to re-formulate the decision on approving visits to the German Democratic Republic by residents of West Germany and West Berlin and issuing inter-district passes, starting from facilitating transportation between East and West Germany.

The Politburo also recommended that the government of the German Democratic Republic immediately release criminals sentenced to one to three years under the Law on the Protection of Public Property, with the exception of those whose crimes may have caused serious consequences.

The Politburo also recommended the immediate release of those who have been arrested and are awaiting sentencing, and whose punishment according to the Law on the Protection of Public Property would not exceed the minimum sentence of one to three years.

    为达到重新建立德国统一的伟大目标
    德国统一社会党中央作出决定
    建议政府采取措施以提高人民生活水平
    【新华社十三日讯】据德意志通讯社十一日讯：德国统一社会党中央委员会政治局在六月九日的会议上决定建议德意志民主共和国政府采取若干措施，以便提高全体人民的生活水平和加强共和国的法律。
    会议公报说：德国统一社会党中央委员会政治局认为，统一社会党和德意志民主共和国政府在过去犯了若干错误。这些错误表现在：关于重新调整购买食品证和没收荒地的决定，以及关于国家采购部门所采取的一些特殊措施与严格的征税制度等等问题上，党和政府没有照顾到个体农民、小贩、手工业者和知识分子的利益。而且，各州、专区与地方在执行上述决定与规定时，又犯了严重的错误，结果有许多人离开了共和国。
    政治局现在所采取的措施是为达到重新建立德国统一的伟大目标，以便利于东德和西德的接近。
    统一社会党中央委员会政治局认为，有必要在最近与修订重工业的计划的同时，采取一系列的措施，改正过去的错误，以提高工人、农民与知识分子、手工业者及其他阶层人民的生活水平。政治局六月九日的会议上也作出了关于贸易与供应，关于农业，以及采取措施以便利于德意志民主共和国与西德之间的交通的决定。为了增加消费品的生产和扩大贸易网，政治局并提出关于在广泛的基础上给予手工业者、小贩、批发商人、私营工业、建筑与运输企业以短期贷款的建议。
    如果最近歇业或放弃了他们的店铺的商店主愿意重新开业，他们的愿望将立即得到考虑。除此而外，国家贸易机构将与私人小贩签订合同，以便更好地供应人民的生活需要。政治局并建议，撤销关于没收荒地的决定；废止对欠税与不能如数缴纳产品的农民所实行的管制。
    对因经营田地发生困难而出租土地，并跑到西柏林或西德去的农民（小农、中农与富农）应该给予回到自己的庄园中的机会。如在例外的情形下不可能做到这一点，应给予他们充分的补偿，给予贷款与帮助他们得到农具与家畜，以便使他们能经营田地。
    政治局已建议农林部长负责采取必要的措施，以便保证农业生产合作社的利益。
    对于所有离开德意志民主共和国逃走后又回到民主共和国或柏林民主区的人，政治局建议发还他们原来的财产，这些财产是根据一九五二年七月十七日的决定加以没收的。如果有个别的情况不能做到这一点，也必须给予补偿。回到德意志民主共和国的人不应给予处分，专区与地方议会以及有关当局应帮助他们找到适当的工作，使他们参加经济的与社会的生活，并获得全部的公民权利（身份证、购买食品证等等）。
    政治局认为，必须从便利东德与西德之间的交通出发，重新制定关于批准西德及西柏林居民到德意志民主共和国来访问以及发给区际通行证问题的决定。
    政治局并建议德意志民主共和国政府立即释放根据保护公共财产法判刑一年至三年的罪犯，但其罪行可能造成严重后果的例外。
    政治局同时建议立即释放那些已被逮捕、正待宣判的，其判决的处分根据保护公共财产法不会超过一至三年的最低刑期的人。
