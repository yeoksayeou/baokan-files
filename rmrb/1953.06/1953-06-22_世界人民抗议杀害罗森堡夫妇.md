Xinhua News Agency, June 21st: TASS, Moscow, June 21st: The Pravda published a speech by Nesmeyanov, President of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, entitled: "The World's Conscience Protests the Murder of the Rosenbergs."

Nesmeyanov said: The murder of the Rosenbergs in the United States yesterday aroused the anger of all the people of the Soviet Union. Progressive humanity regards this bloody act as a brutal crime, and the conscience of the world expresses its angry protest against it. Innocent victims of war hysteria were killed in the electric chair. The organizers of this heinous murder of upright people want to use this to obstruct the lofty struggle of progressive social forces for peace and democracy.

The murder of the Rosenbergs once again exposes the true face of those who want to force the people of the world to accept the so-called American way of life. But freedom-loving people do not want electric chairs or the Ku Klux Klan and McCarran laws in their country, nor do they want lynch law.

The people of all countries long for peace. They are fully determined to fight for peace, for human rights, for true democracy and a better future. They are deeply indignant at this heinous, illegal and barbaric act.

The American reactionaries ignored the calls of millions of people to release the innocent victims and brazenly committed this atrocity.

Electrocution of innocent people is an example of American "law," American "justice," and "humanity." The names of the Rosenbergs will be immortalized in the hearts of ordinary people along with the names of Sacco and Vanzetti, who were also unjustifiably electrocuted by American obscurantists. Humanity will never forgive the crimes of the murderers.

World Federation of Trade Unions and Polish Public Opinion Protest, People in Britain, Austria and Other Countries Hold Protests and Demonstrations
Xinhua News Agency, June 21st: Honest people around the world are protesting the U.S. government's murder of the Rosenbergs in anger.

The Secretariat of the World Federation of Trade Unions announced on the 20th that it had sent a telegram to Eisenhower protesting the U.S. government's heinous act of murdering the Rosenbergs.

All Polish newspapers published commentaries on the 20th, denouncing the U.S. authorities for brutally killing two innocent American citizens. "People's Tribune" commented: "The Rosenbergs were killed in the electric chair simply because they loved peace and, regardless of the crazy war propaganda and all retaliation and persecution, bravely and fearlessly declared their love for peace." The newspaper pointed out that the American ruling circles "are so willing to strangle the ideas of peace and progress! It is because they fear these ideas that they murdered the Rosenbergs in Sing Sing Prison."

Bucharest Radio in Romania commented that the Romanian people expressed their greatest anger at the U.S. government's murder of the Rosenbergs, which they considered "a blatant act of injustice and a new attempt to persecute the cause of peace."

After holding protest demonstrations on the 19th, thousands of people in Britain gathered in Hyde Park on the 20th to observe two minutes of silence for the sacrifice of the Rosenbergs, and held another demonstration. The demonstrators' slogans read: "The death of the Rosenbergs is America's crime." Demonstrations were also held in Liverpool and Birmingham.

On the 20th, the French people flocked to the monument commemorating the French soldiers who died in the liberation of Paris to offer wreaths, all of which were inscribed with words praising and mourning the Rosenbergs. Many other monuments in Paris were piled with wreaths "dedicated to the Rosenbergs."

In Vienna, Austria, in Stockholm, Sweden, and in Tel Aviv in the Middle East, honest people held demonstrations and marches protesting the U.S. government's murder of the Rosenbergs.

Rosenbergs' Defense Lawyer Bloch Says
The U.S. Government Is More Savage Than the Nazis
Xinhua News Agency, June 21st: TASS, New York, June 20th: Newspapers reported that Emanuel Bloch, the Rosenbergs' defense lawyer, told reporters after learning that the Rosenbergs would be sent to the electric chair on the evening of June 19th: "Today, the heads of government are far more savage than the Nazis who once ruled Germany. I firmly believe that President Eisenhower's actions prove that we are living in a period of military dictatorship disguised as democracy. I don't know what kind of beast I am dealing with, but I believe I am dealing with a beast." It is said that Bloch asked the officials in charge of Sing Sing Prison by telephone to convey his love and sympathy to the Rosenbergs. Bloch added: "Please tell them that today I am ashamed to be an American."

Rosenbergs Issue a Petition for Pardon Before Their Sacrifice
Reiterate Innocence and Warn U.S. President Not to Disgrace America
Xinhua News Agency, June 21st: TASS, New York, June 20th: The National Committee for Fair Trial in the Rosenberg Case published the full text of the Rosenbergs' petition to President Eisenhower for pardon. The petition reads: "We have petitioned you once before, and we have recounted to you all the truth, and the truth is unchangeable. Now we solemnly declare our innocence once again... Our prosecutors threaten us with death, threatening to preserve our lives by admitting our crimes. We reject this illegal deal, even to the point of ending our young lives. We cannot become false witnesses to save our own lives and leave a lasting infamy. Mr. President, do not disgrace America - expecting us to provide crimes we did not commit as a condition of preserving our lives."

Some Bourgeois Newspapers in Western European Countries
Express Revulsion at the U.S. Government's Atrocities
Xinhua News Agency, June 21st: Some bourgeois newspapers in Western European countries expressed regret at the U.S. government's brutal act of stubbornly murdering the Rosenbergs despite protests from public opinion around the world, and the adverse effects it caused among the broad masses of people.

Brogan, the foreign affairs commentator for the British Conservative Party's "Daily Telegraph," believes that the murder of the Rosenbergs "is very unfortunate from both a propaganda and a humanitarian point of view." "Reynold's News" said that the moment of electrocuting the Rosenbergs was embarrassing for the United States and the "free world." "Because we may never know whether the Rosenbergs were guilty... because right up to the last minute, the method of enticing these two people to 'confess' to save their lives was still being used." The newspaper said that the murder of the Rosenbergs has "disgusted" millions of "non-communists."

According to Agence France-Presse, newspapers in Paris unanimously expressed "regret" at the U.S. government's murder of the Rosenbergs and expressed concern about the aftermath of the Rosenbergs' death. "Le Parisien Libéré" said: "Many friends that the United States relies on in the free world will undoubtedly first think that the execution of the Rosenbergs was a serious mistake." "Franc-Tireur" called the incident a "horror act" in its headline.

The pro-American Danish "Social-Demokraten" wrote: "The United States could have shown leniency, but it did not do so, which is unwise, and most of America's friends in Europe will regret this."

    涅斯米扬诺夫说：昨天在美国发生的杀害罗森堡夫妇事件，激起了苏联全体人民的愤怒。进步人类认为这一血腥的行为是个残暴的罪行，世界的良心对它表示愤怒的抗议。战争歇斯底里的无辜受难者被用电椅杀害了。这种可恶地杀害正直人民的事件的组织者，想借此来阻挠社会进步力量争取和平与民主的崇高斗争。
    罗森堡夫妇的被杀害再一次揭穿了那些想强迫世界人民接受所谓美国生活方式的人的真面目。但是，爱好自由的人民既不愿意他们的国家里有电椅或三K党与麦卡伦的法律，也不愿意有私刑法。
    所有国家的人民都渴望和平。他们有充分的决心为和平、为人的权利、为真正的民主和美好的将来而斗争。他们对这一可恶的非法和野蛮行为深感愤怒。
    美国反动集团不听千百万人民要求释放无辜的受害者的呼声，悍然犯下了这一暴行。
    用电椅杀害无辜的人民就是美国的“法律”、美国的“司法”与“人道”的榜样。罗森堡夫妇的名字将与萨柯和范齐蒂的名字一起在普通人民的心里永垂不朽，后两人也是被美国矇眛主义者毫无理由地用电椅杀害的。人类决不会饶恕杀人犯的罪行。

    波兰所有报纸二十日发表评论，痛斥美国当局以毒辣的手段残杀两个无辜的美国公民。“人民论坛报”的评论说：“罗森堡夫妇在电椅上被杀死，只是因为他们爱好和平，并且不顾疯狂的战争宣传和一切报复与迫害，英勇无畏地宣布他们热爱和平。”该报指出：美国统治集团“是多么愿意绞杀和平与进步的思想！正是因为害怕这种思想，他们才在新新监狱谋杀了罗森堡夫妇。”
    罗马尼亚布加勒斯特广播电台发表评论说，罗马尼亚人民对美国政府杀害罗森堡夫妇表示最大的愤怒，罗马尼亚人民认为这是“一个明目张胆的不公正的行为和迫害和平事业的一个新的企图”。

    在奥地利的维也纳，在瑞典的斯德哥尔摩和中东的特拉维夫，正直的人民都举行了抗议美国政府杀害罗森堡夫妇的示威和游行。
    罗森堡夫妇的辩护律师布洛克说
    美政府比纳粹分子还要野蛮
    【新华社二十一日讯】塔斯社纽约二十日讯：报纸报道：罗森堡夫妇的辩护律师伊曼纽尔·布洛克知道罗森堡夫妇将于六月十九日晚间被送上电椅处死之后，向各报记者发表谈话：“今天政府的首脑人物比起一度在德国执政的纳粹分子还要野蛮得多。我坚信：艾森豪威尔总统的行为证明了我们是生活在披着民主外衣的军事独裁时期。我不知道，我是在与那一种禽兽周旋；但是我相信：我是在与禽兽打交道。”据称，布洛克在电话中要求新新监狱负责官员把他的爱和同情转达给罗森堡夫妇。布洛克附带说道：“请转告他们，今天我因为自己是一个美国人而感到羞愧。”
    罗森堡夫妇牺牲前发出要求赦免的请愿书
    再次声明无罪并警告美总统不要辱没美国
    【新华社二十一日讯】塔斯社纽约二十日讯：争取罗森堡案公正裁决全国委员会公布了罗森堡夫妇要求艾森豪威尔总统赦免的请愿书的全文。请愿书中写道：“我们已经向您请求过一次，我们向你历述了全部真理，真理是不可改变的。现在我们再一次郑重地声明我们的无罪……我们的起诉人以死亡来要挟我们，要以承认我们的罪行来保全我们的生命。我们拒绝这种非法的勾当，甚至于，我们宁愿结束我们的年青的生命。我们不能够为了苟且保全自己的生命，而变成假证人使自己遗臭万年。总统先生，不要辱没了美国——指望我们提供我们所没有做的罪行作为保全我们生命的条件。”
    西欧国家一些资产阶级报纸
    对美政府的暴行表示厌恶
    【新华社二十一日讯】西欧国家一些资产阶级报纸对美国政府不顾全世界舆论的抗议，悍然杀害罗森堡夫妇的残暴行为及其在广大人民中引起的不良影响，表示遗憾。

    据法新社消息，巴黎各报一致对美国政府杀害罗森堡夫妇表示“遗憾”并对罗森堡夫妇死后的影响表示不安。“解放了的巴黎人报”说：“美国在自由世界里所依赖的许多友人毫无疑问将首先认为处死罗森堡夫妇是一个严重的错误。”“义勇军报”在标题中把这件事称为“恐怖行为”。
    亲美的丹麦“社会民主党人”报写道：“美国本来可以表示宽大，但它却没有这样做，这是不明智的，美国在欧洲的大多数朋友对此都会感到惋惜。”
