    Guangxi and Hunan Salt Industry Departments Should Immediately Recover Salt Sacks
    Comrade Fu Peiji of the Guizhou Salt Transport and Sales Bureau writes: The people's edible salt in the eastern Guizhou region is mostly supplied by transport from Guangxi and Hunan. Because the salt industry departments of the aforementioned two provinces refuse to recover the salt sacks, more than 50,000 sacks, worth more than 760 million yuan, are currently stockpiled in the eastern Guizhou region. If these sacks are not recovered, they will become moldy and rot, which will inevitably increase the burden on the people. It is hoped that the Central South Salt Industry Company will quickly resolve this issue.

    广西、湖南盐业部门应即收回装盐麻袋
    贵州盐务运销局傅培基同志来信：黔东地区人民的食盐，大部是靠广西、湖南运来供应的。由于上述两省的盐业部门拒绝收回装盐的麻袋，致使黔东地区目前积压了麻袋五万多条，约值七亿六千多万元。这些麻袋若再不收回，将要霉烂，必将增加人民的负担。希望中南盐业公司迅速解决这一问题。
