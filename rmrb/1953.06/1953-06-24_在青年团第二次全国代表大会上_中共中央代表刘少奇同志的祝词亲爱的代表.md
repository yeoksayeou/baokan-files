Comrade Representatives:

Since its establishment in 1949, the Chinese New Democratic Youth League, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and based on the long-standing and excellent traditions of the Chinese revolutionary youth movement, has developed into a powerful and advanced force of Chinese youth. Over the past four years, in the revolutionary war to liberate our great motherland, in the great struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, and on all fronts of carrying out a series of social reforms and restoring the national economy, this brave and energetic force has been active with the Party and as the Party's assistant, contributing its strength. The Chinese Communist Party and its great leader, Comrade Mao Zedong, are extremely concerned about and attach great importance to the work of the Youth League, its growth, its role as the Party's assistant and reserve force, and its achievements in uniting the youth of the country to participate in the cause of national construction. On behalf of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong, I extend warm greetings to all the representatives attending the Second National Congress of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League, and congratulate you on the complete success of this congress!

Your congress is being held at a time when our great motherland is beginning to enter a new period of planned construction of the national economy from the period of restoration of the national economy. The new historical period of our motherland has presented new historical tasks to the people of the whole country, which is to gradually realize the industrialization of the country and, on this basis, gradually transition our motherland from New Democracy to socialism. As the Party's assistant and reserve force, all members of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League must stand with the Party at the forefront of the struggle for national industrialization. Youth League members must actively participate in the various constructions of the motherland in their different positions, promote their own initiative and creativity, and play a leading and exemplary role among the Chinese youth masses. Youth League members must use their boundless loyalty to the motherland and the people, relying on close ties with the surrounding masses, to strive to complete and overfulfill the state's industrial and agricultural production plans.

As the Party's assistant and reserve force, all members of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League must work hard to study Marxism-Leninism and improve their level of communist consciousness. Youth League members must work hard to study the great theories of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, study the works of Comrade Mao Zedong, study various scientific knowledge, especially the advanced science and technology of the Soviet Union, study the knowledge of various policies of the Party and the state, and study various production businesses and various work businesses. Youth League members must always remember Lenin's teaching: study, study, and study again. This is a major task for Youth League members.

As the Party's assistant and reserve force, all members of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League must consolidate their organization and fight for the purity and seriousness of their organization. Youth League members must learn to use the method of criticism and self-criticism to fight against all bad phenomena that harm the people's cause and the Party's cause. Youth League members must cultivate discipline and organization in their own ranks, cultivate moral qualities of loyalty to the motherland, loyalty to the people, and loyalty to the cause of the Party, and promote a hard-working, simple, realistic, and close-to-the-masses style. Youth League members must strive to make the Youth League a more consolidated backbone force in the Chinese youth movement politically, organizationally, and ideologically, and thereby make the youth of the whole country a powerful assault force on all fronts of the motherland.

As the Party's assistant and reserve force, all members of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League must highly promote the spirit of patriotism and internationalism, closely link the great cause of defending the motherland and building the motherland with the great cause of defending world peace, learn from the glorious example of the Soviet Leninist Communist Youth League, continue to unite with the youth of the peace, democracy, and socialist camps and the advanced youth of other countries in the world, and bravely advance to defend world peace and strive for a bright future for mankind!

Comrades! Comrade Stalin said: Youth is our future, our hope. Our Party and our motherland place unlimited trust and hope in youth. We firmly believe that the Chinese New Democratic Youth League, under the leadership of the Party, will be good at uniting the youth of the whole country and fulfilling its responsibilities in the construction of our great motherland.

Comrades! The Central Committee of the Party hopes that your congress will fully discuss the tasks that the Party has submitted to the Youth League in this new historical period, and give play to the spirit of communist criticism and self-criticism, sum up work experience, promote strengths, correct shortcomings and errors, and at the same time earnestly absorb the advanced experience of Soviet youth work, in order to achieve the purpose of educating all members and improving work.

Strive to study the theory of Marxism-Leninism!

Long live the great unity of the youth of all China!

Long live the great unity of the youth of the world who love peace and democracy!
