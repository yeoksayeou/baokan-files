Reader's Letters Abstract

    Conscientiously Do a Good Job in Film Rental Work
    Comrade Jiao Yushu Writes a Letter
    Jiao Yushu of Beijing Iron and Steel Industry School writes: The North China Management Office of the China Film Management Company is not doing a good job in film rental. The office previously rented the film "My University" to our school for screening, but due to excessive film breaks, the screening had to be stopped midway. After we raised our opinions, the office conducted a self-criticism and stated that they would definitely correct it in the future. However, recently, when the office screened the film "Honor Trial" for our school, they again failed to rewind the copies, resulting in the screening being stopped midway, wasting the students' time.
    After a film is screened, each reel must be rewound once in sequence before it can be screened again. However, after the office screened "Honor Trial" elsewhere, they did not rewind the copies and brought them to our school for screening. As a result, when the film started, it was playing backwards from the end. Under these circumstances, we had to stop the screening midway and spend nearly an hour rewinding each reel, wasting the students' precious time. The China Film Management Company's careless work in film rental must be earnestly corrected.
    Reply from the North China Management Office of the China Film Management Company
    The North China Management Office of the China Film Management Company writes: Comrade Jiao Yushu's opinion about the "Honor Trial" film not being rewound, which affected the screening time, is correct. This was caused by the careless work style of the film repair personnel in our office. In addition to expressing our thanks to Comrade Jiao Yushu, we have ordered the relevant personnel to conduct a profound self-criticism and established a strict liaison system to resolutely prevent similar incidents from occurring.

### 认真作好出租影片工作  焦玉书同志来信

专栏：读者来信摘要

    认真作好出租影片工作
    焦玉书同志来信
    北京钢铁工业学校焦玉书来信：中国影片经理公司华北管理处出租影片工作作得不好。该处过去曾将影片“我的大学”租给我校放映过，因断片次数过多，以致中途停演。经我们提出意见后，该处作了检讨，表示今后一定改正。但是最近该处为我校放映“荣誉审判会”一片时，又没有倒回拷贝，以致中途停演，浪费了同学们的时间。
    影片放映后，必须将每盘拷贝重新依次倒回一次，才能再放。但该处在别的地方放映过“荣誉审判会”后，没有把拷贝倒回，就拿到我校来放映，以致映出时影片是由结尾倒着往前放映。在这种情况下，不得不中途停演，花去将近一个钟头的时间，把每盘拷贝重新倒了一遍，浪费了同学们极宝贵的时间。中国影片经理公司出租影片工作这样粗枝大叶，必须切实改正。
    中国影片经理公司华北管理处的复信
    中国影片经理公司华北管理处来信：焦玉书同志对“荣誉审判会”影片未倒，影响了映出时间一事所提意见是正确的。这是由于本处检修影片人员在工作中的粗枝大叶作风造成的。本处除向焦玉书同志致以谢意外，并已责令有关人员作了深刻的检讨，订立了严格的联系制度，坚决防止类似事件的发生。
