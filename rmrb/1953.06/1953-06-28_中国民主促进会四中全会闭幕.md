Xinhua News Agency, June 27th: The Fourth Plenary Session of the Third Central Council of the China Association for Promoting Democracy (CAPD) concluded on the 26th. During the session, attendees listened to a report by Ma Xulun on behalf of the Central Standing Council, titled "Actively Participate in National Construction, and Strive to Consolidate and Expand the People's Democratic United Front!" as well as a report by Lin Handa on revising the association's charter and convening the Second National Congress of the CAPD. The meeting also held group discussions on Ma Xulun's report, and twenty people spoke at the plenary session, introducing local work experiences and special topics. In the group discussions and plenary speeches, everyone unanimously agreed with Ma Xulun's assessment of the CAPD's past work achievements, the review of shortcomings in the report, and opinions on future work.

The meeting believes that: In the past two years, the CAPD has combined various political struggles and social reform movements in its work, and has made certain achievements in promoting members and the masses they connect with to actively implement national policies and laws, participate in various political movements for self-education, and develop and consolidate the organization. These achievements should be attributed to the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the efforts of all comrades.

The meeting pointed out that: The current political task of the CAPD is the three major central tasks of the country this year. Since more than 80% of the CAPD's members are engaged in cultural and educational work, and most of them are middle and primary school teachers and staff, the CAPD should, in addition to continuing to participate in various political activities, mobilize members and the masses they connect with to actively participate in national cultural and educational construction work, with a focus on middle and primary school work. As a united front-type New Democratic political party mainly uniting, educating, and reforming petty-bourgeois intellectuals, the CAPD must educate its members and the masses they connect with to understand the relationship between their work and national construction, conduct self-education and self-reform through practical work, actively implement national cultural and educational policies with a spirit of responsibility to the country and the people, do a good job in their professions, improve the quality of teaching, and cultivate outstanding construction talents for the country.

The meeting put forward the requirements of facing practical work and facing grass-roots organizations, so as to better promote members to do their jobs well and complete national tasks. The meeting pointed out that: In grass-roots units, the organization of the CAPD should, under the leadership of the Communist Party, closely combine with the central tasks of the unit to carry out work. Grass-roots organizational activities should conform to the requirements of the overall administrative guidelines and plans of the unit, and at the same time, closely link and cooperate with trade unions, the Communist Youth League and other organizations.

Regarding the guiding principles of organizational work, the meeting believes that: the organizational work of the CAPD should be subordinate to the requirements of the nature and tasks of the association, subordinate to the central political tasks of the association in a certain period, and should implement the guiding principle of combining consolidation and development. The meeting also pointed out that in order to complete the new historical tasks of the CAPD during the period of national construction, it is necessary to strengthen political and ideological leadership and improve working methods.

During the meeting, all attendees and observers participated in the report meeting hosted by the Learning Committee of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference on the 20th, and listened to a report by Xi Zhongxun, Deputy Director of the Cultural and Educational Committee of the State Council of the Central People's Government, on cultural and educational policies. The meeting also invited Dong Chuncai, Deputy Minister of Education of the Central People's Government, to give a report on middle and primary school education and normal school education. On the eve of the closing of the meeting, all participants were invited to attend a reception held by the United Front Work Department of the CPC Central Committee. Before the start of the meeting on the afternoon of the 23rd, all participants observed three minutes of silence for Mr. and Mrs. Rosenberg, internationally renowned peace fighters who were killed by American imperialism, to express their condolences.

The meeting closed on the morning of the 26th. At the closing meeting, the "Resolution on the Report of the Central Standing Council," the "Resolution on Convening the Second National Congress," and the "Resolution on Revising the Articles of Association" were unanimously adopted. Finally, a telegram of respect to Chairman Mao was unanimously approved. At the closing meeting, representatives from local organizations in Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Shenyang, Guangzhou, Hangzhou, Guangxi, and other places spoke successively, unanimously supporting Ma Xulun's report and various resolutions passed by the meeting.

In his closing remarks, Wang Shao'ao pointed out that this meeting will undoubtedly play a great guiding and promoting role in the future work of the CAPD. He said: The CAPD, as a political party that is a component of the people's democratic united front, should continue to carry out ideological remolding, strengthen patriotism and internationalism education, actively participate in national construction work, and better play its role as an assistant and bridge under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. To complete our tasks, all comrades need to make redoubled efforts.

Several resolutions passed by the Fourth Plenary Session of the Third Central Council of the China Association for Promoting Democracy:
	One, Resolution on the Report of the Central Standing Council

After in-depth discussions, it was believed that this report correctly analyzed the current domestic and international situation, summarized the main achievements and shortcomings of the work of the association since the Third Plenary Session, and pointed out the current political tasks and work guidelines of our association. The meeting unanimously agreed with this report, called on all comrades to conduct in-depth study, and implement the spirit of this report into practical work, and strive to complete the political tasks of our association.

    中国民主促进会四中全会闭幕
    【新华社二十七日讯】中国民主促进会第三届中央理事会第四次全体会议在二十六日闭幕。会议期间，听取了马叙伦代表中央常务理事会所作的题为“积极参加国家建设，为巩固和扩大人民民主统一战线而努力！”的报告，以及林汉达所作关于修改会章及召开中国民主促进会第二次全国代表大会的报告。会议还分组讨论了马叙伦的报告，并有二十人在大会上作了介绍各地工作经验和专题的发言。在小组讨论和大会发言中，大家一致同意马叙伦在报告中对中国民主促进会过去工作成绩的估计、缺点的检讨以及对今后工作的意见。
    会议认为：中国民主促进会在过去两年来结合各项政治斗争和社会改革运动进行工作，在推动会员及其所联系的群众，积极执行国家的政策、法令，和参加各项政治运动进行自我教育方面，以及发展和巩固组织方面，都取得了一定的成绩。这些成绩的获得，应该归功于中国共产党的正确领导和全体同志的努力。
    会议指出：中国民主促进会当前的政治任务就是今年国家的三大中心任务。由于民主促进会百分之八十以上的会员从事于文化教育工作，其中大部分会员是中、小学教职员，因此，民主促进会今后除了继续参加各项政治活动外，应动员会员及其所联系的群众，积极参加国家文教建设工作，而其中又以中、小学工作为重点。作为以团结、教育、改造小资产阶级知识分子为主的统一战线性质的新民主主义政治党派，中国民主促进会必须教育会员及其所联系的群众认识自己所担负的工作与国家建设的关系，从实际工作中来进行自我教育和自我改造，积极地以对国家和人民负责的精神来执行国家文化教育政策，做好业务，提高教学质量，为国家培养优秀的建设人材。
    会议提出了面向实际工作、面向基层组织的要求，以便更好地推动会员做好工作，完成国家任务。会议指出：在基层单位中，民主促进会的组织应在共产党的领导下，密切结合本单位的中心任务进行工作。基层组织活动应符合于本单位行政上总的方针与计划的要求，同时也要密切与工会、青年团及其他组织的联系和配合。
    关于组织工作的方针问题，会议认为：民主促进会的组织工作应该服从于会的性质、任务的要求，服从于会在一定时期内的中心的政治任务，并应贯彻巩固与发展相结合的方针。会议并指出，为了完成民主促进会在国家建设时期的新的历史任务，必须加强政治思想领导，改进工作方法。
    会议进行期间，出席和列席的全体人员参加了中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会学习委员会在二十日所主持的报告会，听了中央人民政府政务院文化教育委员会习仲勋副主任关于文化教育政策的报告。会议还邀请了中央人民政府教育部副部长董纯才作了关于中、小学教育和师范教育问题的报告。在会议闭幕前夕，全体与会人员应邀参加了中共中央统一战线工作部举行的招待会。与会全体人员在二十三日下午会议开始前曾为被美帝国主义杀害的国际著名的和平战士罗森堡夫妇默哀三分钟，以志悼念。
    会议在二十六日上午闭幕。在闭幕会上，全体一致通过了“关于中央常务理事会报告的决议”、“关于召开第二次全国代表大会的决议”、“关于修改会章问题的决议”。最后一致通过了向毛主席的致敬电。在闭幕会上，北京、上海、天津、沈阳、广州、杭州、广西等地方组织代表相继发言，一致拥护马叙伦的报告和会议所通过的各项决议。
    王绍鏊在闭幕词中指出：这次会议对中国民主促进会今后的工作，无疑地将起着很大的指导作用和推动作用。他说：中国民主促进会作为人民民主统一战线的一个组成部分的政治党派，应继续进行思想改造、加强爱国主义与国际主义教育，积极参加国家建设工作，更好地在中国共产党领导下发挥助手作用和桥梁作用，完成我们的任务，需要全体同志加倍努力。
