Xinhua News Agency, June 27th:

    The basic construction departments under the Central People's Government's Ministry of Heavy Industry have achieved great results since launching the anti-waste and responsibility system establishment campaign. Many units, during this campaign, have begun to eliminate serious waste; work that was previously no one's responsibility now has established responsibility systems. This provides favorable conditions for fully completing this year's engineering plan and ensuring project quality.

    When carrying out this campaign, the basic construction departments paid great attention to closely integrating it with current work, purposefully mobilizing workers, technicians, and staff to expose and solve various key problems in their work. As a result, the construction management and leadership style of many units have begun to show a new atmosphere; many units have effectively promoted current engineering construction due to the establishment of practical and feasible responsibility systems. For example, the waste and lack of accountability at the construction site of the new large-scale rolling mill of Anshan Iron and Steel Company were very serious. After the leadership mobilized the masses of employees to expose more than 22,000 problems, they immediately guided them to solve more than 10,000 of them. The rebar and wooden formwork team at this construction site, in response to the shortcomings of rebar "traveling" around the site in the past, established systems for rebar entry and exit, storage, and numbering. The carpentry team also established responsibility systems for packaging, unloading, fetching, delivering, and entry and exit. This not only eliminated waste but also accelerated the turnover of materials. The Beijing Iron and Steel Industry College construction area, based on the phenomena of no one being responsible in dispatching, planning, construction, and surveying exposed by the employees, rectified the dispatching organization and established agencies such as the construction affairs section and the planning and statistics section, specializing in construction affairs and planning and statistics work. The Northeast 301 Factory construction site of the Non-Ferrous Metals Industry Bureau, in response to the low quality of concrete projects and the fact that the thickness of concrete did not meet design requirements, which were exposed by the employees, successively established a number of inspection systems. As a result, the amount of work completed by this construction site in May exceeded the original plan. The construction project of the First Engineering Company's First Construction Site of the Non-Ferrous Metals Industry Bureau is a large-scale motor factory building, and the quality requirements of the project are highly precise. At the beginning of the campaign, the leadership of the construction site regarded the establishment of a technical quality responsibility system as the central task. After repeatedly conducting quality education for all employees, they guided them to establish an independent quality inspection organization and formulated various quality standards and operating procedures. As a result, the quality of rivets quickly reached 99.7%.

    Through the practical education of the anti-waste and establishment of responsibility system campaign, the broad masses of employees have established the concept of cherishing state property and being highly responsible for their work. Now, whether on construction sites, in management departments, or material supply departments, a new atmosphere of saving raw materials, cherishing tools, and caring about project quality has been formed. Since the launch of this campaign, the workers of the rebar and wooden formwork team of the basic construction departments of Anshan Iron and Steel Company have recovered 19,000 catties of rebar, 6,000 square meters of formwork, 9,160 catties of nails, 30 tons of steel wire, and 87 cubic meters of wood from the materials previously abandoned on various sites, with a total value of over 640 million yuan. In addition, the workers of the metal structure company cleaned out more than 50 wind drills; the workers of the wooden formwork team of the steelmaking construction engineering company pulled out nails from old formwork worth more than 700 million yuan. The technical personnel of the Shenyang Nanhu construction site of the Non-Ferrous Metals Industry Bureau, after exposing the rework waste caused by weak technical guidance in the past, have begun to go deep into the construction site to conduct technical guidance. The technical director of the construction site also personally organized business studies to teach construction workers and team leaders to be familiar with and use construction design drawings. Therefore, the technical level of workers and construction workers has been rapidly improved, thereby eliminating the phenomenon of poor project quality caused by backward technical guidance. The woodworking team of Dai Ying of the Industrial Engineering Company of Benxi Iron and Steel Company, after exposing waste and lack of accountability in their work, greatly exerted their enthusiasm and created a "standard template" to master the angle of the roof frame, increasing work efficiency by 130%.

    The anti-waste and establishment of responsibility system campaign of the basic construction units under the Central People's Government's Ministry of Heavy Industry has been launched successively since April. At present, two-thirds of the construction units under the Ministry of Heavy Industry have entered the stage of establishing a responsibility system. In order to make this campaign move in the right direction, the Ministry of Heavy Industry held special meetings in Beijing and Shenyang in late May and early June to make specific arrangements for the work in the stage of establishing a responsibility system.

    中央重工业部各基本建设部门
    建立责任制运动收获很大
    【新华社二十七日讯】中央人民政府重工业部所属各基本建设部门开展反浪费和建立责任制运动以来，获得了很大成绩。许多单位在这一运动中，开始消除严重的浪费现象；过去无人负责的工作，现在也都建立了责任制度。这就为全面地完成今年工程计划和保证工程质量，提供了良好的条件。
    各基本建设部门在开展这一运动时，都很注意紧密结合当前工作，有目的地深入发动工人、技术人员和职员，揭发和解决工作中的各种关键问题。因此，许多单位的施工管理和领导作风，开始出现了新的气象；许多单位由于建立了切实可行的责任制度，有力地推动了当前的工程建设。如鞍山钢铁公司新建大型轧钢厂工地的浪费和无人负责现象非常严重，领导方面发动职工群众揭发出两万二千多个问题后，就立刻引导他们解决了一万多个。这个工地的钢筋木模队，针对过去钢筋在工地“旅行”的缺点，建立了钢筋出入库、保管和编号等制度；木工队也建立起包装、包卸、包取、包送和出入库等责任制度。这样，不仅消除了浪费现象，而且还加速了材料的周转。北京钢铁工业学院工区根据职工们揭发出来的调度、计划、施工和测量等工作中的无人负责现象，整顿了调度机构，并成立了工务股和计划统计股等机构，专门负责工务和计划统计工作。有色金属工业管理局东北三○一厂工地，针对职工们揭发出来的混凝土工程质量低劣和混凝土厚度不合设计要求的情况，陆续建立了一些检查制度，因此，五月份这个工地完成的工程数量超过了原订计划。有色金属工业管理局第一工程公司第一工地的施工工程是大型电机厂房，工程的质量要求高度精确。运动开始时，工地的领导方面就把建立技术质量责任制当作中心工作。他们向全体职工群众反复进行了质量教育后，又引导他们建立起独立的质量检查机构，并订立了各项质量标准和操作规程，因而铆钉的质量很快就达到了百分之九十九点七。
    经过反浪费和建立责任制运动的实际教育，广大职工树立了爱护国家财产和对工作高度负责的观念。现在，不论是在工地上，在管理部门或是材料供应部门，节约原材料、爱护工具和关心工程质量形成了一种新的风气。鞍山钢铁公司基本建设部门自开展这次运动以来，钢筋木模队的工人们，从各现场收回的过去被弃掷的材料中，就有钢筋一万九千斤，模板六千平方公尺，钉子九千一百六十斤，钢丝三十吨和木材八十七立方公尺，合计价值六亿四千多万元。此外，金属结构公司的工人清理出风钻五十多台；炼钢建筑工程公司木模队的工人拔下的旧模板的钉子，价值七亿多元。有色金属工业管理局沈阳南湖工地的技术人员，在揭发了过去因技术指导薄弱造成的返工浪费后，已开始深入工地进行技术指导。该工地技术主任还亲自组织业务学习，教施工员和小组长熟悉和运用施工设计图纸，因此，工人和施工员的技术水平得到迅速提高，并从而消除了因技术指导落后而产生的工程质量低劣的现象。本溪钢铁公司工业工程公司木工戴英小组，在揭发了工作中的浪费和无人负责现象后，大大发挥了积极性，创造了掌握房架角度的“标准卡板”，使工作效率提高了百分之一百三十。
    中央人民政府重工业部所属各地基本建设单位的反浪费和建立责任制运动，是从四月份以来相继展开的。目前，重工业部所属三分之二的施工单位，已进入了建立责任制的阶段。为了使这一运动向着正确的方向前进，重工业部于五月底和六月初分别在北京和沈阳两地举行了专门会议，对建立责任制阶段的工作，进行了具体布置。
