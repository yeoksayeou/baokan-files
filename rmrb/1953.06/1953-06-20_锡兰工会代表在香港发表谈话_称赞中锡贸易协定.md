Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, June 19th: According to a report in the Hong Kong "Ta Kung Pao" on the 17th, Mendis, the head of the Ceylon trade union delegation invited to China to participate in the "May Day" celebrations and the Seventh National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions, and Dama Puryia, a member of the delegation, told reporters from the Hong Kong "Ta Kung Pao" on the 16th when they passed through Hong Kong on their way back to Ceylon: Trade between Ceylon and China has benefited all levels of people in Ceylon. In particular, the rubber industry, which was once on the verge of bankruptcy, has seen the light of hope again after being in despair.

Mendis and Dama Puryia talked about the US monopoly of the world rubber market and the heavy blow this monopoly dealt to Ceylon's economy. They said that the signing of the Sino-Ceylon trade agreement not only enabled many rubber plantations in Ceylon that had been forced to close down to resume production, and tens of thousands of unemployed workers to regain employment, but also allowed the Ceylon government to use the profits from rubber exports to develop the production of Ceylon's main export product.

    锡兰工会代表在香港发表谈话
    称赞中锡贸易协定
    【新华社广州十九日电】据香港“大公报”十七日报道，应邀来我国参加“五一”节庆祝典礼和中国工会第七次全国代表大会的锡兰工会代表团团长曼迪斯、团员达马普里雅，十六日经香港回锡兰时对香港“大公报”记者说：锡兰和中国之间的贸易，使锡兰各阶层的人都受到利益，尤其是曾经陷于破产的橡胶业，已从绝望中重新看到了光明的前途。
    曼迪斯和达马普里雅谈到美国垄断世界橡胶市场和这种垄断对锡兰经济的沉重打击。他们说：中锡贸易协定的签订，不但使锡兰许多被迫停业的橡胶园重新恢复了生产，万千的失业工人又获得了职业，而且锡兰政府还可以用输出橡胶所得的利润，来发展锡兰这个主要出口品的生产。
