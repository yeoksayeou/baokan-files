    Implement the Election Law and Carry Out Universal Suffrage Work
    Central and Southern Regions Actively Prepare for Universal Suffrage; Guangdong and Henan Provinces Begin Pilot Projects
    The six provinces of the Central and Southern Administrative Region, as well as Wuhan and Guangzhou, have successively established election committees. Election committees in counties, cities, and autonomous regions of ethnic minorities under Hunan and Jiangxi have also been fully established, and counties under other provinces are also establishing them one after another. In mid- to late May, Guangdong and Henan provinces began pilot projects at the township level.
    Following Guangdong Province's launch of a pilot project in Yingde County, Henan Province also established two basic-level election pilot groups for urban and rural areas. The rural pilot group, headed by the chief of the Civil Affairs Section of the Provincial Civil Affairs Department, consists of thirteen people. They selected Tubagang Township in the third district of Kaifeng County and Changshang Township in the first district as pilot townships. After two weeks of study, they went to the townships on May 18. The urban pilot group is equipped with fourteen strong cadres and selected the fourth district of Kaifeng City as a pilot district, which will begin work in early June. Wuhan City concentrated 150 cadres for training on May 24, and in early June, it will begin pilot projects in four areas: Heping Street in the Jiang'an District, where government agencies are concentrated; Zongguan Street in the Qiaokou District, where factories are concentrated; a street in the Jianghan District, where commerce is concentrated; and a township in the suburbs. In order to prepare, the Municipal Election Committee held forums with street leaders and district cadres, as well as representatives from industry and commerce, in late May to understand the public's opinions and requests regarding the election work. Hunan Province held a meeting of chairpersons of election committees from across the province on May 28 and 29, during which the province's universal suffrage plan was discussed and approved. After the meeting, the Provincial Election Committee transferred 150 cadres from relevant departments to conduct pilot projects.
    In order to strengthen the specific guidance on basic-level election work, the Political and Legal Committee of the Central and Southern Administrative Committee sent a basic-level election investigation team of 42 people on May 14 and 15 to the lakeside and ethnic minority areas of Hunan Province, the revolutionary base areas of Jiangxi Province, the typical townships of Henan, Hubei, Guangdong, and Guangxi provinces, and the key streets of Guangzhou City to understand the population survey, voter registration, and other aspects of basic-level elections. Currently, each group has entered key townships and streets to carry out investigation work.
    In arranging the universal suffrage work, all provinces have particularly emphasized that basic-level elections must be closely integrated with production, and that basic-level elections must be carried out well on the premise of not missing the farming season and not affecting production. Therefore, the basic-level election work below the county level in each province is carried out in batches according to the specific conditions of rural production in each province. For example, Henan Province plans to carry out the election in three batches: the first batch from July 1 to August 20, completing 20% of the townships; the second batch from July 15 to September 5, completing 40%; and the remaining 40% in the third batch, from August 1 to September 20. Municipal districts, suburban areas, townships, and the Jiaozuo mining area will begin in August. Severely affected areas will not conduct pilot projects and will begin in early September, ending on September 20. After the basic-level elections are completed, county people's congresses can be convened. Jiangxi Province proposed to ensure that agricultural production is not delayed and to carry out the election in batches using the gaps in agricultural production time. When carrying out basic-level election propaganda work, Jiangxi also proposed to go to the homes of farmers as much as possible, without necessarily holding large meetings, so as not to delay farmers' production. The suburbs of Guangzhou City are divided into two batches: the first batch begins in early June and ends in mid-July during the busy farming season. The second batch runs from late September to the end of October.
    In addition, in stepping up preparations for universal suffrage, all localities have also emphasized the need to do a good job in propaganda work. For example, the Guangdong Provincial Election Committee suggested that the Propaganda Department of the South China Sub-bureau of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party organize various propaganda forces to immediately launch widespread propaganda, especially emphasizing strengthening propaganda for women and overseas Chinese. While formulating the "Cadre Training Plan for Basic-Level Election Work" and the "Population Survey and Voter Registration Work Plan," the Henan Provincial Election Committee also formulated the "Key Points of the Propaganda Plan for Carrying Out Universal Suffrage Work," putting forward specific propaganda content and methods for different objects such as workers, farmers, intellectuals, industrialists and businessmen, and ethnic minorities, and organizing all propaganda forces to cooperate. In addition to newspapers, radio stations, movies, and slides cooperating in propaganda, the Provincial Radio Station was also required to hold two to three lectures during the provincial cadre training period in late May. In addition, a large number of documents and propaganda materials related to universal suffrage were printed and distributed.
    In order to prepare for universal suffrage, Guangzhou City began adjusting its districts in April and May this year, which will be completed in early June. In February, March, and April, the Civil Affairs Bureau and the Public Security Bureau conducted population surveys and voter qualification research in three administrative streets and one township. The urban area will begin pilot projects in June, and universal suffrage will be fully launched in August. (Our Wuhan Reporter Station)
    Zhejiang Province Arranges Basic-Level Election Work for the Whole Province
    The Zhejiang Provincial Election Committee held its second meeting on May 25 to arrange basic-level election work for the whole province. Jiang Hua, Chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial Election Committee, pointed out at the meeting: Since liberation, Zhejiang Province has undergone various political reform movements and economic recovery work, and the people's political consciousness has been improved and the degree of organization has been strengthened. Cities, counties, districts, and townships have held many people's representative conferences or farmers' representative conferences, so there is a considerable foundation for carrying out the universal suffrage movement. However, due to the uneven development of work in various parts of the province, some democratic reform work in some areas has left many problems, and we lack experience in universal suffrage work, and the universal suffrage time is also during the busy farming season, so difficulties exist. He asked everyone to overcome difficulties and work hard to do a good job in universal suffrage work under the correct leadership of the Provincial People's Government and with the support of the people of the whole province.
    Li Fengping, Secretary-General of the Zhejiang Provincial Election Committee, submitted the draft of the Zhejiang Provincial Election Committee's deployment plan for basic-level election work to the meeting for discussion. The draft pointed out: When carrying out basic-level election work, (1) it should be clear that production is the overriding central task in rural areas, and universal suffrage work must be completed on the premise of ensuring that production is not delayed. (2) Election work must be strictly controlled within the requirements stipulated by the central government, and the content of combined work must not be arbitrarily increased. (3) Appropriate methods must be adopted for different regions, different situations, and different conditions to carry out work, avoiding general and simplified approaches. (4) It is necessary to face basic-level election units, deeply grasp the situation, attach importance to typical experimental work, and summarize experience in a timely manner. The draft also proposed that, according to the specific conditions of the province, the election work of the 6,000 basic-level election units in the province should generally be completed in three batches in terms of the steps for carrying out basic-level election work, namely: each county should conduct typical universal suffrage experiments from May to June; except for some areas that cannot carry out basic-level universal suffrage work due to special circumstances from July to August, the general area can start a batch; fully launch basic-level universal suffrage work from September to October. The draft also put forward specific opinions on the preparation work for the provincial, special area, city, and county universal suffrage, such as the establishment of election committees at all levels, the holding of training courses for typical experimental work teams, the formulation of propaganda plans, and the conduct of various administrative affairs related to elections. This draft was unanimously approved after discussion and revision by all the committee members present. The "Zhejiang Province Election Staffing Plan" and the "Universal Suffrage Funding Budget" were also discussed and approved at the meeting. (Originally published in Zhejiang Daily)
    More Than 100 Counties and Cities in Sichuan Province Begin Pilot Projects for Basic-Level Elections
    Various parts of Sichuan Province are actively preparing for basic-level elections. As of May 21, 85 cities and counties under the jurisdiction of Chengdu, Zigong, and Wenjiang, Suining, Mianyang, Wanxian, Jiangjin, Daxian, Neijiang, Yibin, and Leshan Special Zones have established election committees and offices. The remaining city and county election committees will also be established soon. More than 110 cities and counties across the province dispatched work teams in early or mid-May, selecting a township (or city辖区) to conduct typical experimental work. The 18 key pilot townships in Yibin, Daxian, Nanchong and other counties have completed the first stage of investigation and registration of the population, registration and review of voters, and the announcement of voter lists, entering the second stage. Before starting the basic-level trial election work, all localities first concentrated cadres for three to five days of study and made necessary preparations. The work teams are all led by the responsible cadres of the city and county themselves. (Originally published in Sichuan Daily)

    贯彻选举法，开展普选工作
    中南各地积极准备普选工作广东、河南两省开始重点试办
    中南行政区六省及武汉、广州二市都已先后成立了选举委员会，湖南、江西所属县、市、少数民族的自治区选举委员会也已全部成立，其他各省属县正纷纷成立。五月中下旬，广东、河南两省已开始了乡的重点试办工作。
    继广东省在英德县展开重点试办工作之后，河南省也成立了城、乡两个基层选举重点试办组。乡的试办组由省民政厅民政科科长担任组长，共十三人。他们选择了开封县三区土柏岗乡和一区厂尚乡为重点试办乡。在经过两个礼拜的学习后，已于五月十八日下乡。城市试办组也配备了坚强干部十四人，选择开封市第四区为重点试办区，六月初旬即可开始工作。武汉市在五月二十四日集中了一百五十名干部进行训练，六月初旬即在市江岸区机关集中的合作街、礄口区工厂集中的宗关街、江汉区商业集中的一个街道及郊区一个乡等四个点开始重点试办工作。为了作好准备工作，市选举委员会曾在五月下旬按区分别召开了街长和区干部、工商界座谈会，了解群众对选举工作的意见和要求。湖南省于五月二十八、二十九两天召开了全省各地选举委员会主席会议，讨论通过了省的普选计划。会后省选举委员会即在有关部门抽调一百五十名干部深入下去进行重点试办工作。
    中南行政委员会政治法律委员会为加强对基层选举工作的具体指导，于五月十四、十五日派了由四十二人组成的基层选举调查组，分别到湖南省的滨湖及少数民族地区、江西省革命根据地，河南、湖北、广东、广西四省的典型乡和广州市的重点街道，了解基层选举中人口调查、选民登记等工作的情况和问题。目前各组已分别进入重点乡和街道展开了调查工作。
    各省在安排普选工作中，都特别强调了基层选举必须密切结合生产，在生产不违农时、不影响生产的原则下，搞好基层选举。因此各省县以下的基层选举工作都是根据本身农村生产的具体情况，有计划地分批进行的。如河南省计划分三批进行：第一批自七月一日至八月二十日进行，完成百分之二十的乡；第二批自七月十五日至九月五日进行，完成百分之四十；其余的百分之四十在第三批进行，时间是八月一日至九月二十日。市辖区、市郊区、乡镇及焦作矿区等在八月份开始。重灾区不搞重点试办工作，都在九月初开始，九月二十日结束。基层选举结束后，即可召开县人民代表会。江西提出保证不误农时，利用农业生产空隙时间分批进行。在进行基层选举宣传工作时，江西还提出要尽量到农民家里去，不一定开大会，免得耽误农民生产。广州市郊区分两批进行，第一批自六月初旬开始，七月中旬农忙时结束。第二批九月下旬到十月底进行。
    另外在加紧普选准备工作中，各地还强调了必须做好宣传工作。如广东省选举委员会为加强普选的宣传工作，曾建议中共中央中南局华南分局宣传部组织各种宣传力量，立即展开广泛的宣传，特别是强调加强对妇女和华侨的宣传。河南省选举委员会在拟定“基层选举工作干部训练计划”和“人口调查，选民登记工作计划”的同时，还拟出了“关于开展普选工作的宣传计划要点”，针对工人、农民、知识分子、工商界、少数民族等不同对象，分别提出具体的宣传内容和宣传方式，组织了一切宣传力量进行配合。除报纸、广播电台、电影、幻灯等要配合宣传外，在五月下旬省训练干部期间，还规定省广播电台举办两次到三次讲座。另外还印发了大量的有关普选的文件和宣传材料。
    广州市为作好普选准备工作，从今年四、五月份即着手进行了区划的调整，六月上旬可全部调整完毕。二、三、四月并由民政局、公安局进行了三个行政街及一个乡的人口调查及选民资格研究工作。市区六月份开始重点试办，八月可全面展开普选工作。（本报武汉记者站）
    浙江省布置全省基层选举工作
    浙江省选举委员会于五月二十五日举行第二次会议，布置全省基层选举工作。浙江省选举委员会江华主席在会议上指出：本省自解放以来，经过各项政治改革运动及经济恢复工作，人民政治觉悟已有提高，组织程度已经加强，市、县、区、乡均已开过多次各界人民代表会议或农民代表会议，因此开展普选运动已有相当的基础。但由于本省各地工作发展不平衡，有些地区的各种民主改革工作遗留下不少问题，而我们对普选工作尚缺乏经验，同时普选时间又正值农忙季节，因此困难是存在的。他要求大家在省人民政府的正确领导下，在全省人民的支持下，克服困难，努力做好普选工作。
    浙江省选举委员会李丰平秘书长将浙江省选举委员会关于基层选举工作的部署草案提交会议讨论。草案中指出：进行基层选举工作时，（一）应明确生产是当前农村中压倒一切的中心任务，必须在保证不耽误生产的前提下完成普选工作。（二）选举工作必须严格控制在中央所规定的要求范围内进行，不得任意增加结合工作的内容。（三）必须按照不同地区、不同情况、不同条件采取适当的办法进行工作，避免一般化、简单化的做法。（四）必须面向基层选举单位，深入掌握情况，重视典型试验工作，及时总结经验。草案又根据本省的具体情况，在开展基层选举工作的步骤方面提出全省六千个基层选举单位的选举工作一般分三批完成，即：五月至六月各县分别进行普选典型试验；七月至八月除某些地区因特殊情况不能进行基层普选工作外，一般地区可以展开一批；九月至十月全面展开基层普选工作。草案对省、专区、市、县进行普选的准备工作如建立各级选举委员会、举办典型试验工作队训练班、制订宣传计划及进行有关选举的各种行政事务等工作，也都提出了具体意见。这一草案经到会全体委员讨论修正后一致通过。会上并讨论通过了“浙江省选举工作人员配备方案”及“普选经费预算”。（原载浙江日报）
    四川省一百多个县市开始进行基层选举重点试办工作
    四川省各地正积极进行基层选举的准备工作。截至五月二十一日止，成都市、自贡市及温江、遂宁、绵阳、万县、江津、达县、内江、宜宾、乐山等专区所辖市、县，已有八十五个成立了选举委员会及办公室。其余各市、县选举委员会也将于最近成立。全省已有一百一十多个市、县于五月上旬或中旬派出工作队，选好一个乡（或市辖区）进行典型试验工作。宜宾、达县、南充等县十八个重点试办乡已结束第
    一阶段的调查与登记人口，登记与审查选民及公布选民名单的工作，进入第二阶段。各地在开始基层试选工作之前，都先集中干部进行了三天到五天的学习，并作了必要的准备工作。各工作队都是由市、县的负责干部亲自领导。（原载四川日报）
