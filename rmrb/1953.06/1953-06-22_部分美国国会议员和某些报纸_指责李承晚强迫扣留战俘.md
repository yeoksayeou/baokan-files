Xinhua News Agency, June 21st: The Syngman Rhee gang's "release" of prisoners of war has caused much discussion within the U.S. Congress. Even some American congressmen believe that the United States should recover the seized prisoners of war. Senator Cooper said: "We should do everything we possibly can to recover all prisoners of war. This way we demonstrate our sincerity, and then we should insist on an immediate ceasefire." Senator Hendrickson, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said: "I strongly believe that the committee should immediately begin an investigation to determine the extent of American negligence in these prisoner escape incidents." Congressman Celler accused Syngman Rhee of being a "long-standing, failed, and volatile ruler." He said he would propose that Congress investigate why the United Nations forces did not prevent Syngman Rhee's "release" of prisoners of war. Senator Hubert Humphrey said: "I am saddened to see this happen when the armistice agreement is about to be concluded."

Certain American bourgeois newspapers have also accused Syngman Rhee of his actions. The Washington Post said: "Now is the time to 'take a tough stance' against Syngman Rhee." The Washington Post said, "The fundamental mistake that 'caused Syngman Rhee to make trouble' lies with the American side." The San Francisco Chronicle suggested that the U.S. President issue an ultimatum to Syngman Rhee, demanding that he immediately rescind the order to "release" prisoners of war and "begin to recover them." The newspaper said: "Another option is: to implement martial law and arrest any saboteurs—including Syngman Rhee."

    部分美国国会议员和某些报纸
    指责李承晚强迫扣留战俘
    【新华社二十一日讯】李承晚匪帮“释放”战俘的行动在美国国会内引起议论纷纷。甚至一部分美国议员也认为美国应追回被劫夺的战俘。参议员库柏说：“我们应尽我们可能尽的力量追回一切战俘。这样我们就表示了我们的诚意，然后我们应该坚持立即停战。”参议院军事委员会委员汉德里克逊说：“我极度认为，委员会应该立即着手进行调查，以决定在这些战俘逃亡事件中美国方面过失的程度。”众议员塞勒指责李承晚是“老牌的、失败的、变化无常的统治者”。他说，他将提出建议要求国会查究为什么联合国军没有防止李承晚“释放”战俘的事件。参议员赫伯特·汉弗莱说：“看到这事在停战协定快要缔结时发生，我很难过。”
    美国某些资产阶级报纸也指责李承晚的行动。华盛顿“邮报”说：现在是对李承晚“采取强硬的态度时候了”。华盛顿邮报说，“引起李承晚‘捣乱’的基本错误在于美国方面。”旧金山“纪事报”建议，由美国总统发出最后通牒给李承晚，要求立刻取消“释放”战俘的命令，并“开始把他们追回”。该报说：“另一个办法是：实行戒严，逮捕任何破坏分子——包括李承晚在内。”
