Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, June 14th: The Rural Work Department of the Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee held its first rural work symposium this year from June 1st to 6th. It summarized the spring plowing production work in the Northeast region and proposed the slogan "Concentrate efforts and strive to ensure and improve the quality of summer weeding."

According to reports at the symposium, spring plowing in the Northeast region this year has four prominent characteristics: First, sowing work was timely and rapid. Second, in the widespread promotion and key dissemination of Guo Houqi's (Zhaoyuan County) high-yield experience, field cultivation techniques were significantly improved. Each province cultivated large areas of high-yield fields, accounting for 2% to 30% of the cultivated land area. Third, mutual aid and cooperation have developed more than before. In addition to the 3,755 agricultural production cooperatives experimentally established by the region, the number of farmers participating in mutual aid teams has increased in various places, and the quality of mutual aid teams has improved. The proportion of permanent mutual aid teams to the total number of teams has increased from 18% last year to about 30%. Fourth, the leadership style has improved somewhat. Provincial and county cadres have begun to concentrate leadership and go deeper into the grassroots; district and village cadres have begun to learn how to focus on doing a good job as examples and rely on Communist Party members, Communist Youth League members, and activists to lead production.

The symposium studied in detail the heavy tasks brought about by the characteristics that appeared in spring plowing and the summer weeding work in front of us. Because it has been raining continuously in Northeast China since late May, and grass seedlings are growing vigorously, the farmland using Guo Houqi's high-yield experience for wide sowing and requiring thinning will require hundreds of thousands more man-days per province than last year, and summer weeding will be more intense than in previous years; although the mutual aid and cooperation movement in the entire region has developed, the newly established agricultural production cooperatives and many mutual aid teams lack experience and must be further consolidated. Therefore, it is necessary to "concentrate efforts and strive to ensure and improve the quality of summer weeding." In summer weeding, in addition to paying attention to technical issues, it is very important to do a good job in mutual aid and cooperation organizations, carefully calculate the required labor force, and rationally organize labor. The symposium mentioned that appropriate leadership should be given to various mutual aid and cooperation organizations, and special attention should be paid to consolidating the newly established cooperatives.

    中共中央东北局召开农村工作座谈会
    决定集中力量做好夏锄工作
    【新华社沈阳十四日电】中共中央东北局农村工作部于六月一日到六日召开了今年首次农村工作座谈会，总结了东北区的春耕生产工作，提出了“集中力量，为保证和提高夏锄工作质量而斗争”的口号。
    据座谈会上反映：今年东北区的春耕，有四个突出的特点：首先是播种工作及时迅速。其次是在普遍宣传和重点推广郭后旗（肇源县）的丰产经验中，显著地提高了田间耕作技术，各省都培植了占耕地面积百分之二到百分之三十的大面积丰产田。再次是互助合作较前发展，今年除由区试办了三千七百五十五个农业生产合作社外，各地参加互助组的农户增多了，互助组的质量提高了。常年互助组占总组数的比重，已由去年百分之十八增加到百分之三十左右。第四是领导作风有所改进，省、县干部开始集中领导，深入下去；区、村干部开始学会重点深入做好样子，并依靠共产党员、青年团员和积极分子领导生产的工作方法。
    座谈会详细地研究了由于春耕中出现的特点和摆在眼前的夏锄工作所带来的繁重任务。因为东北各地自五月下旬以来，阴雨连绵，草苗齐长，用郭后旗丰产经验进行宽播必须间苗的耕地，每省就要比去年多用几十万个人工，夏锄将比历年都要紧张；全区的互助合作运动虽有发展，但新建的农业生产合作社和许多互助组都缺乏经验，必须进一步巩固。所以必须“集中力量，为保证和提高夏锄工作质量而斗争”。在夏锄中，除注意技术问题外，搞好互助合作组织，认真计算需用劳动力的情况，合理组织劳动，十分重要。座谈会中提到了对各种互助合作组织都应该进行适当地领导，特别应注意使新建的合作社巩固下来。
