Central Geological Department's Explanation on Several Issues in the Mass Mineral Reporting Campaign

    Letter from the Central Geological Department: From September of last year to May of this year, the Central Geological Department received a total of 1,084 letters from people from all walks of life across the country reporting mineral deposits. The reports covered a total of 1,977 mineral deposit locations, distributed throughout all provinces (including Taiwan), with more than 40 types of minerals. In addition to reporting mineral deposit locations, the people also sent in mineral samples and mineral data (such as geological maps, mineral deposit maps, clippings, etc.). In some areas, some people voluntarily organized themselves to carry out amateur mineral reporting work. For example, Zhuang Shengqing, a farmer from Miyanshan Township, Zhangshui District, Yin County, Zhejiang, organized a prospecting team and sent four batches of ore, including excellent hematite and other valuable ores. These facts fully demonstrate that the mass mineral reporting campaign has been increasingly widely launched throughout the country. This not only provides rich reference materials for geological exploration work, but also makes every Chinese person deeply feel the infinite richness of the motherland's underground treasures, and fills them with infinite hope and confidence in the country's industrial construction.
    The people care about the economic construction of the motherland and have put forward many hopes, requirements and suggestions to the Central Geological Department. A summary of these requirements and suggestions is as follows:
    I. The masses who report minerals hold high patriotic enthusiasm and eagerly request the Geological Department to investigate after reporting. This request should be welcomed. However, this year is the beginning of the first Five-Year Plan, and the Geological Department's exploration tasks have increased twenty to thirty times compared to last year, while the increase in manpower is very limited. Under the circumstances of small strength and large tasks, in order to ensure the timely completion of the exploration plan, the mineral deposits reported by the masses must be handled separately according to the urgency of the current construction needs. If the mineral deposit is urgently needed by the state, an investigation will be conducted immediately. If the reported mineral deposit location is adjacent to the Geological Department's existing exploration teams, the relevant exploration team will be notified to conduct a supplementary investigation if possible; all those that are not urgently needed by the state will be investigated at a later date. It is hoped that the mineral reporting masses will not be discouraged if no one goes to investigate after reporting.
    II. Regarding the question of how to identify mineral outcrops, we have begun to write some common sense about identifying mineral outcrops, which will be published successively in the newspapers. As for printing publicity brochures and pamphlets on identifying mineral outcrops, and holding mobile mineral specimen exhibitions, some of these we have considered and are carrying out in conjunction with relevant units, and some cannot be carried out temporarily due to limited manpower and resources.
    III. Regarding further development of the mass mineral reporting campaign and the promulgation of measures to reward people for reporting minerals, we have formulated preliminary plans and are preparing to implement them.
    IV. Regarding how to reduce the cost of mailing letters and minerals for the masses when reporting minerals, we have studied this with the postal and telecommunications departments. In the future, letters reporting minerals do not need to be stamped; as for how to reduce the cost of mailing minerals, further consultations are needed.
    In addition, some mineral reporters did not send the minerals, data and letters together, and sometimes the letter arrived long before the minerals. In addition, some mineral or data packages did not clearly state the name and address of the sender, so they could not be compared with the letters after they were received, so that the origin of the minerals could not be known. I hope everyone will pay attention to this issue when reporting minerals in the future.

### 中央地质部对群众报矿运动中几个问题的说明

    中央地质部对群众报矿运动中几个问题的说明
    中央地质部来信：去年九月到今年五月，中央地质部共收到各地各界人民群众报矿的信件一千零八十四封。报告的矿藏地址共一千九百七十七处，产地分布遍及全国各省（包括台湾）；矿产种类达四十余种。人民群众除了报告矿藏地点外，还寄来矿石标本和矿产资料（如地质图、矿藏图、剪报等）。有些地区部分群众自动组织起来进行业余报矿工作，如浙江鄞县漳水区密岩乡农民庄生卿组织了一个探矿小组，前后寄来了四批矿石，其中有很好的赤铁矿和其他很有价值的矿石。这些事实充分说明群众报矿运动已经日益广泛地在全国展开。这不但给地质勘探工作提供了丰富的参考资料，并且使每一个中国人民深深感到祖国地下宝藏的无限丰富，对国家工业建设充满了无限的希望和信心。
    人民群众关心祖国的经济建设，向中央地质部提出了许多希望、要求和建议。对于这些要求和建议，综合说明如下：
    一、报矿的群众抱着高度的爱国热忱，报矿以后便急切要求地质部前去调查。这个要求是应该受到欢迎的。但是今年是第一个五年计划的开始，地质部的勘探任务比去年增加了二十倍到三十倍，而人力的增加却很有限。在力量小任务大的情况下，为了保证勘探计划的如期完成，对群众报来的矿藏，就不能不根据目前建设需要的缓急，分别处理。如属国家所急需的矿藏，就立刻进行调查，如所报矿藏地址和地质部现有各勘探队相邻近，则转告有关勘探队在可能条件下附带调查；凡属不是国家所急需的，就缓一步调查。希望报矿群众不要因为报矿以后没有人去调查而灰心。
    二、关于如何识别矿苗的问题，我们已着手写一些识别矿苗的常识，即将在报上陆续发表。至于印发宣传手册和识别矿苗的小册子、举办矿物标本流动展览等工作，有的我们已考虑和有关单位联合进行，有的限于人力物力暂时还不能进行。
    三、关于进一步开展群众报矿运动，颁发奖励人民报矿办法，我们已经拟定了初步计划，准备实行。
    四、关于如何使群众在报矿时减少邮寄信件和矿石的费用问题，我们已和邮电部门研究。今后报矿信件可以不贴邮票；至于邮寄矿石如何减低费用办法，还待进一步协商。
    另外，有一些报矿者没有把矿石、资料和信件一齐发出，有时信到了很久矿石才到。再加上有些矿石或资料包裹上面没有写清寄矿人姓名和地址，因此收到后不能和信件互相对照，以致无法知道矿石的产地。希望大家今后报矿时注意这个问题。
