    Our Friendship Will Remain Evergreen
    Wang Ming
    I have a photo, a photo with Hungarians, Koreans, and Chinese people. I have carried this photo to many places, and every time I see it, my emotions cannot be calmed, and I feel like I have so much to say.
    This photo was taken by Comrade Albas, the political commissar of the Hungarian Volunteer Aid Korea Medical Team. The photo includes eleven volunteer Hungarian medical workers aiding Korea, four Korean model medical workers, five Chinese People's Volunteer Army combat heroes who have been awarded medals, four commanders of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, and three Chinese literary and art workers who came to the front from Beijing.
    They came to Korea from various places, gathered in front of a Korean thatched house that had been destroyed by artillery fire and still smelled of burning, and took this photo. The background of the photo: above is a transparent blue sky, and behind it is a rolling small hill warmed by the late winter sun. Snow is melting on the hill, and a thin layer of water vapor is rising. Communication trenches run from the foot of the hill to the top, and the volunteer commanders and combat heroes in the photo are guarding here, and I am also interviewing in this unit.
    This day was February 21st. After taking the photo, a simple but very grand get-together was held in the home of an old Korean woman. On the plank wall of the small house hung portraits of the leaders of the three countries: Korea, China, and Hungary. On the other side of the plank wall, nine large characters were woven with pine and cypress and red cloth: "Our Friendship Will Remain Evergreen". At the meeting, everyone ate red wine from Beijing, brandy from Budapest, and apples, chestnuts, and peanuts from Pyongyang. They ate and laughed loudly. Especially the Hungarian girls, who were having the most fun. The small house seemed to be jumping with songs and laughter. A Korean comrade said to a Hungarian comrade: "Please allow me to convey the gratitude of our people to you in the name of our motherland!"
    I remember that on the Spring Festival this year, the soldiers of the unit I was interviewing organized a Yangko team and went to pay New Year's greetings to the comrades of a certain Korean hospital, and the comrades of the Hungarian medical team were working in this hospital. That's how they met, formed close friendships, and visited each other often. Once, our unit was going to hold a military medal awarding ceremony, and the hospital lent us their auditorium. The dean and the responsible comrades of the medical team also participated. Incidentally, we visited the hospital and the Hungarian medical team.
    Dean Huang Shoufeng, a chemist with the demeanor of a scholar, often took off his glasses because he was emotionally moved when we talked. He said: "The Hungarian medical team came to Korea from more than 14,000 kilometers away. Our people are as grateful to them as they are to the Chinese People's Volunteers. The Hungarian comrades love Korea as they love their own motherland, which has had a very significant impact on our people and our wounded soldiers. I feel that we are not isolated, and we have friends all over the world."
    As early as July 1950, the first batch of Hungarian volunteer medical teams to aid Korea came to Korea, and the current one is the fourth batch. They treat the wounded and sick soldiers of the Korean People's Army and the Volunteer Army who come from the front lines, and they also often study medicine with Korean medical workers. Thanks to them, as of February of this year, more than 10,000 wounded and sick soldiers have left the hospital with gratitude and returned to the front line; a large number of Korean medical workers have gained new knowledge from them and have gone to various posts.
    These doctors and nurses all have happy families in the beautiful countryside and cities of Hungary; the winter and spring on the banks of the Danube are alluring, but they left; from more than 14,000 kilometers away, they came to Korea with the great enthusiasm of their nation and a strong sense of responsibility for the cause of peace. Now, they are working in the roar of planes and artillery, in blizzards, and in sub-zero cold. On the evening of February 8th, enemy planes bombed a nearby peaceful village. They—these lovely young men and women—immediately organized more than a hundred people to carry out selfless rescue work, braving the strafing and the raging fire.
    "Science and civilization, freedom and happiness, have already gained an overwhelming advantage in this world. Our struggle will surely be victorious."
    This is a sentence said by Comrade Albas, the political commissar of the medical team. This lively, cheerful, humorous, and military-mannered young man left a deep impression on me. Once, he was performing a major operation on a wounded volunteer soldier. Outside, enemy planes were strafing and bombing, and the small house of the operating room was shaking. People advised him to go out and take shelter, but he refused. He continued to work. Later, he said very excitedly: "I must be with him, I can't go out. In front of such a volunteer hero who is so seriously injured that he doesn't even moan, I feel very small. Being with them gives me strength. Their greatest calmness and greatest tenacity make me admire them. It is my greatest honor to be able to fight with such soldiers. Do you think my conscience would allow me to go out?..."
    Comrade Albas also took me to visit their wards and the laboratory in the tunnel. I only felt that I had entered an amazing realm. In the tunnel, there were electric lights, running water, and small rooms with ceilings, floors, and sky-blue walls, and glass cabinets filled with various medical instruments. In the ward, I saw the wounded soldiers lying peacefully on wire beds. I asked a wounded comrade from a certain artillery company of the Volunteer Army. He excitedly wanted to sit up and talk to me. I pressed him down and asked him: "How are you, comrade, are you feeling better?" He said:
    "Good, good, the Hungarian and Korean doctors and nurses are so good to us volunteers, I, I don't know how to say it..." I turned my head, stretched out my hand, and tried to calm myself as much as possible, but it was impossible. I tightly grasped Albas's hand. Albas understood what I meant. He hugged me tightly in his arms. At that time, I felt that I was not only hugging Albas alone, but the upright conscience of all the Hungarian people.
    On the night of the military medal awarding ceremony, as soon as the meeting was over, the situation of the meeting was conveyed to the medical team. Then, the comrades of the medical team raised their hands and swore: "We swear that we will use our blood and conscience for the peace of Korea, we will do our best, and we will not hesitate to sacrifice everything..." This is the oath of a dozen people, but it is also the voice of all the Hungarian people educated by Comrade Rákosi.
    When we were about to part, Albas hugged us again. He asked Dean Huang Shoufeng to accurately translate his words to us, and he asked us to bring his words to China: "We are brothers in a family. From now on, time will pass day by day. Time is beginning day by day. Spring is coming. In our internationalist family, spring flowers will bloom everywhere. Our friendship, our words, and our work are endless. We can win, we will definitely win!"
    Now it has been a long, long time since I left the place where I met them. And they, too, have left there and gone to another place on the front line. I miss them. Every time I pick up the photo, I want to say: Peace will surely be victorious. There will be such a day, and it is not far away. —At night, under the transparent blue sky, let all the windows in Korea be opened, let those air-raid curtains and straw curtains be taken down, let the cream-colored electric lights shine out, let all the Korean children sing like little birds in the morning in their homes, and let peaceful, happy, peaceful, and rich days forever descend on this beautiful land.

    我们的友谊四季常青
    汪明
    我有一张照片，照片上有匈牙利人、朝鲜人、中国人。我带着这张照片走过不少地方，每次我看到它的时候，我的感情就不能平静，就觉着有很多很多的话要说出来。
    这张照片是匈牙利志愿援朝医疗队的政治委员阿尔巴斯同志拍的。照片上有十一个志愿援朝的匈牙利医务工作者，有四个朝鲜的模范医务工作者，有五个获得过勋章的中国人民志愿军战斗英雄，有四个中国人民志愿军某部的指挥员，还有三个从北京来到战地的中国文艺工作者。
    他们从各个不同的地方来到朝鲜，聚集在被炮火摧毁过的还带着燃烧的焦糊气味的朝鲜草屋前面，拍下了这张照片。照片的背景：上面是蓝得透明的天空，后面是一带起伏的被冬末的太阳烤得暖烘烘的小山岗，山岗上雪在溶化着，升起一层薄薄水蒸气。从山脚到山顶，串通着一条条的交通沟，照片上的志愿军的指挥员和战斗英雄们，就守卫在这里，而我也正在这个部队里采访。
    这一天是二月二十一日，拍完照片以后，就在一位朝鲜老太太的家里，举行了一个看起来是简单的，然而是非常隆重的联欢会。小屋子的板壁上，挂着朝、中、匈三个国家的领袖像。板壁的另一边，用松柏和红布编织成九个大字：“我们的友谊四季常青”。会上，大家吃着从北京来的红葡萄酒、从布达佩斯来的白兰地酒、从平壤来的苹果、板栗和花生。一边吃着一边大声地谈笑。特别是那些匈牙利的姑娘们，玩得最起劲。小屋子好像就在歌声和欢笑里跳跃着似的。一个朝鲜同志对一个匈牙利同志说：“请允许我以祖国的名义，给你们传达我们人民的感谢！”
    记得是今年春节那一天，我进行采访的这个部队的战士们，组织了一个秧歌队，敲打着锣鼓去给朝鲜某医院的同志拜年，而匈牙利医疗队的同志就在这个病院工作。这样他们就认识了，结成了很亲密的朋友，并且时常来往。有一次，我们的部队要开颁发军功章大会，医院把他们的礼堂借给了我们，院长和医疗队的负责同志也参加了。就便，我们访问了这个医院和匈牙利医疗队。
    院长黄寿凤同志，是个有着学者风度的化学家，我们交谈的时候，他因为感情激动，常常要把眼镜摘下来。他说：“匈牙利医疗队从一万四千多公里以外来到朝鲜，我们的人民，像感激中国人民志愿军那样地感激他们，匈牙利同志把朝鲜当作他们自己的祖国那样地爱着，这给了我们的人民和我们的伤员们以非常重大的影响。我觉得我们不孤立，全世界到处都有我们的朋友。”
    远在一九五零年的七月，匈牙利的第一批志愿援朝医疗队就来到了朝鲜，现在的已经是第四批了。他们一方面治疗着从火线上下来的朝鲜人民军和志愿军的伤病员，一方面也常常和朝鲜的医务工作者一起研究医学。经过他们的手，到今年二月份为止，已有一万多伤病员带着感激的心情，离开医院重回到前线去；大批的朝鲜医务工作者，从他们这里获得了新的知识，走到各个的岗位上去。
    这些医生和护士们，在匈牙利的美丽的乡村和城市里，都有着一个幸福的家庭；多瑙河畔的冬天和春天，是诱人的，但是他们离开了；从一万四千多公里以外，带着他们民族的盛情，带着对和平事业的强烈责任感来到朝鲜。现在，他们在飞机和大炮的轰响声中工作着，在暴风雪里、在零下的严寒里工作着。二月八日的晚上，敌机狂炸了附近的和平村庄，他们——这些可爱的青年男女们，立即组织了一百多人，冒着扫射，冒着正在燃烧的烈火，进行了忘我的抢救工作。
    “科学和文明，自由和幸福，在这个世界上已经取得了压倒的优势了。我们的斗争一定是胜利的。”
    这是医疗队的政治委员阿尔巴斯同志说的一句话。这个活泼、开朗、充满风趣和有着军人风度的年青人，给我留下了一个很深的印象。有一次，他正给一个志愿军伤员动大手术，外边，敌机正扫射轰炸着，手术室的小房子都抖动起来了。人们劝他出去避一避，他拒绝了。继续工作下去。后来，他非常激动地说：“我必须跟他在一起，我不能出去。在这样负了重伤连哼都不哼一声的志愿军英雄战士的面前，我觉得我很渺小。跟他们在一起，我就感到有了力量。他们最大的镇静，最大的坚韧性，使我敬佩。能够跟这样的战士战斗在一起，是我的最大的荣誉。你们想，我的良心能让我出去么？……”
    阿尔巴斯同志又带我参观他们的病房和坑道里的化验室。我只觉着我走进了一个使人惊奇的境界。坑道里有着电灯、自来水和镶着天花板、地板、漆着天蓝色墙壁的一间间小房子，玻璃柜子里摆着各种各样的医疗器具。在病房里，我看见伤员们安祥地躺在钢丝床上。我问到一个志愿军某炮兵连的伤员同志，他兴奋地要坐起来给我谈话，我把他按下去，问他：“怎么样，同志，好些么？”他说：
    “好，好，匈牙利和朝鲜的医生护士同志们，对我们志愿军太好了，我，我不知道该怎说才好……”我回过头来，伸出我的手，想尽量使得自己平静些，但不可能，我紧紧地握住了阿尔巴斯的手。阿尔巴斯是深懂得我的意思的，他一下把我紧紧地拥抱在他的怀里。那个时候，我觉着我拥抱的不只是阿尔巴斯一个人，而是匈牙利全体人民的正直的良心。
    开颁发军功章大会的那天晚上，会一开完，在医疗队里就传达了那个大会的情形。于是，医疗队同志们举手宣誓了：“我们宣誓，我们以我们的鲜血和良心，为了朝鲜的和平，我们尽我们的所能，不惜牺牲一切……”这是十几个人的誓言，然而，也是在拉科西同志教养下的全体匈牙利人民的声音。
    我们临分手的时候，阿尔巴斯再一次地拥抱我们。他要求院长黄寿凤同志把他的话准确地翻译给我们，他要求我们把他的话带给中国：“我们是一个家庭里的兄弟。从此以后，时间一天天地过去了。时间一天天地在开始着。春天就要到来。我们这个国际主义的大家庭里，将到处开满春天的花朵。我们的友谊、我们的话、我们的工作是无尽的。我们能够胜利，我们一定能够胜利的！”
    现在我离开会见他们的地方已经很久很久了。而他们，也离开那里到战线的另一个地方去了。我怀念他们。每当我拿起照片的时候，我就想说：和平一定能够胜利。会有那样的一天，而且，已经不远了。——夜晚，在蓝得透明的天空底下，让朝鲜的所有的窗户都打开来，让那些防空的幕布和草帘都扯下来，让发着奶油般颜色的电灯光都射出来，让所有的朝鲜孩子们都在家里像清晨的小鸟一样地歌唱着，让和平、幸福、安详和丰富的日子永远降临到这块美丽的土地上。
