Since 1951, when the Xinhua Bookstore system implemented settlement methods across the country, it has eliminated the phenomenon of overdue payments and accelerated capital turnover. The implementation of settlement methods means that all business transactions between enterprises are promptly and efficiently settled through banks, centralizing credit and transforming the previous relationships of mutual borrowing and overdue payments into a single relationship of centralized credit with the bank. Before the implementation of settlement methods, the phenomenon of mutual overdue payments among Xinhua Bookstores at all levels was very serious, resulting in a large amount of capital backlog. Since the implementation of settlement methods, the Xinhua Bookstore's general and branch stores have generally been able to settle accounts receivable and payable on time. For example, the North China General Branch of Xinhua Bookstore used to take three or four months to recover each payment. Now, through bank collection settlements with Northwest, Southwest, and Central South branches, the average recovery time is only fourteen or fifteen days. Settlements with East China and North China branches are even faster due to convenient transportation. Within two months of implementing the settlement method, the Southwest General Branch saw a 41.4% increase in the time its subordinate branches and sub-branches took to turn over payments, compared to the month before implementation. Because the phenomenon of mutual overdue payments has been eliminated, and payments can be settled on time, and with the guarantee of the settlement method, the capital turnover of various bookstores has accelerated. In 1951, the average capital turnover for the Northwest General Branch was 1.52 times, with each turnover taking 236 days. After implementing the settlement method, the turnover time for the first half of 1952 was 194 days, 42 days shorter than in 1951. The North China General Branch's capital turnover in the first half of 1951 was 35 days, which has now been reduced to 15 days.

Due to the acceleration of capital turnover, capital has been greatly saved. In 1952, the operating tasks of various bookstores increased by about 100% compared to 1951, but the amount of credit decreased significantly. Taking the North China General Branch as an example, the amount of credit in 1952 was only 30% of that in 1951. The Guangzhou Branch owed 4.7 billion yuan to various regional general branches in 1951, and still felt a shortage of funds. After implementing the settlement method, in just three months, not only could new payments be made on time, but also more than 3 billion yuan of debt was repaid.

Since the implementation of settlement methods, all stores have developed business plans to better organize purchasing and sales. To ensure that the plans are realistic, all stores have actively worked to study business, understand the needs of local culture and education for books, reduce blindness in operations, and gradually change the imbalance of purchasing and sales in various stores. In the first half of 1951 (before the implementation of settlement) the difference between the amount of goods purchased and the amount of goods sold by Xinhua Bookstores nationwide was 15.59%. By the second half of 1951, this difference had narrowed to 13.66%, and in the first half of 1952, the difference was 0.01%. By the second half of the year, there was no difference. Some bookstores were even able to handle a batch of previously backlogged books.

    消灭了拖欠货款现象加速了资金周转
    新华书店系统推行结算办法有成绩
    新华书店系统自一九五一年在全国各地推行结算办法以来，已消灭了货款拖欠现象，加速了资金周转。实行结算办法，就是企业与企业之间的交易往来，全部通过银行迅速、及时地集中结算，把以往企业间互相挪借、亏欠货款的关系，转为单一的对银行集中信用的关系。在未实行结算办法前，各级新华书店之间互相拖欠货款的现象很严重，造成资金的大量积压。自实行结算办法后，新华书店各总分店一般对应收应付的货款，都能按期结算。如新华书店华北总分店过去收回每笔货款，都要三、四个月。现在通过银行对西北、西南、中南各区分店托收结算的货款，平均十四、五天就可收回；向华东区及华北区分店结算的货款，由于交通便利，收款更快。西南区总分店在实行结算的两个月内，其所属分、支店上缴货款的时间，比实行结算前一个月增加了百分之四十一点四。由于消除了相互拖欠的现象，货款已能按期结算，又有结算办法的保证，各书店资金周转加快了。西北总分店一九五一年平均全区资金周转一点五二次，每次周转时间为二百三十六天；实行结算办法后，一九五二年上半年周转一次的时间为一百九十四天，比一九五一年缩短了四十二天。华北总分店一九五一年上半年资金周转一次为三十五天，现在已缩短到十五天。
    由于资金周转加快了，就大大节约了资金。一九五二年各书店经营任务比一九五一年增加一倍左右，信贷额反而减少了许多。以华北总分店为例，一九五二年信贷额仅为一九五一年的百分之三十。广州分店在一九五一年积欠各区总分店货款达四十七亿元，资金仍感不足；实行结算办法后仅三个月，不但新的货款能及时承付，并且偿付了三十多亿元的债务。
    实行结算办法以来，各店为了更好地组织购销，全都编制了业务计划。各店为使计划符合实际，都积极努力钻研业务，了解当地文化教育书籍的需要情况，减少了经营上的盲目性，从而逐渐改变了各店的购销不平衡现象。全国各地新华书店一九五一年上半年（实行结算以前）进货多于销货的差额为百分之一五点五九，到一九五一年下半年缩小差额到百分之一三点六六，一九五二年上半年差额为百分之零点零一，下半年已没有差额了。有的书店还可处理一批原先积压的书籍。
