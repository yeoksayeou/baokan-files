From the Salesperson Representative Meeting, Seeing Ways to Improve State-Owned Commercial Work
Deputy Director of the Central South Financial and Economic Committee, Zeng Chuanliu

The Wuhan Purchasing and Supply Wholesale Station of the China Department Store Company convened a salesperson representative meeting in April. This meeting was not only a vivid policy education and business learning experience for the salespeople who participated, but also a specific policy education and business learning experience for us who are engaged in leadership work. The problems revealed at this meeting are common problems in the state-owned commerce of the Central South Region. We should propose improvement methods to further promote state-owned commercial work.

I

The meeting first studied the problem of the backlog of processed socks in Wuhan. Up to now, Wuhan has a backlog of more than 220,000 dozen processed socks, and it is estimated that about 80,000 to 100,000 dozen have been allocated and are backlogged in various grassroots department stores. The result of ranking the backlog of socks is: 37.5% of the total are fundamentally unsuitable for residents' needs; 52.5% are of poor quality and high cost, and need to be sold at reduced prices; 10% can be sold, but the salespeople have not seen them before. The reasons for the backlog are mainly reflected in the following aspects:

First, the state-owned commerce's idea of serving production and consumption is not clear. Many state-owned commercial units in various regions have not actively opened up sales channels for processed commodities. Some salespeople have the idea of "selling whatever is convenient," and non-branded goods in their hands are difficult to meet consumers. Some salespeople believe that as long as the "three no differences" (no difference in goods, no difference in money, no difference in reports) are achieved, it doesn't matter whether there is a backlog or not. Some salespeople are afraid of having too many goods, which makes it troublesome for buyers to choose; they are afraid of the trouble of inventorying at night, and think that having fewer goods is easier than having more. Some state-owned stores treat customers with a bureaucratic style. A small vendor in Songbu went to the Songbu store four times and failed to buy goods. He reflected that: the first time it was not open, the second time the people were not free, the third time they were eating, and the fourth time it was closed. Many leading cadres and planning cadres do not order goods according to local needs, and only want a few famous brands.

Second, chaotic procedures and systems also contributed to the backlog of processed goods. The sales department and the storage department do not communicate with each other. Salespeople do not know what goods are stored in the warehouse and how much is stored, and the storekeeper does not know what goods the store is short of. Some allocation personnel do not properly match styles and varieties according to the needs of local residents. As a result, the goods that the local area needs are not available, and the goods that are allocated are not needed.

Third, there is blindness in processing orders. Blind support, blind processing, without distinguishing different manufacturers with different production equipment and technical conditions according to market needs, and even mistakenly fixing many seasonal workers, turning the seasonal production of handicrafts into year-round production. Some cadres, divorced from reality, replaced all the processed socks in Wuhan with the trademark of the department store company, without considering that the masses' habitual needs for trademarks would take a long time to change. On the other hand, they do not actively help and urge processing plants to improve specifications, improve quality, improve management, and reduce costs. The masses call the 20-count yarn processed men's and women's over-the-ankle socks "stretch and break" (collapse on the foot), saying that its size is "too small for adults and too large for children." The products of 1951 were already heavily backlogged, but the leadership did not investigate and study, and did not calculate the detailed account, and then processed more than 400,000 dozen in 1952.

Without accounting, it is not easy to know how much loss we have caused to the people's property by blindly processing, blindly allocating, and not actively promoting sales. These more than 220,000 dozen socks have been backlogged for periods ranging from six months to two years. If the price is calculated based on a cost reduction of 4.8% to 38.8%, a loss of 2.8 billion yuan will be incurred; if the backlog continues, the monthly capital interest alone will require a payment of 110 million yuan, or 1.3 billion yuan per year, not to mention warehouse rent and insurance costs.

The fact that processed socks are backlogged has seriously educated us. In the future, we must first learn to account, and we must account at all times, and leading cadres must account even more. The calculated figures will scientifically tell us whether it is in line with the interests of the country or causing losses to the country. We must also learn to investigate residents' needs, investigate the purchasing power within the scope of supply of stores, learn to study commodity costs, study sales techniques, actively and correctly organize the source of goods, strengthen the planning of processing orders, vigorously promote the sales of processed goods, and urge processing plants to improve products, so as to achieve the purpose of serving production and affecting production.

II

The meeting also reflected the serious phenomenon of shortages of towels, socks, and other general merchandise needed by the masses in many areas. Although many wholesale stations and grassroots stores have achieved some results in implementing the economic accounting system in the first quarter, the chaotic phenomenon in operation is generally present. These chaotic phenomena are mainly reflected in the formulation of plans and the calculation of prices:

First, under the influence of the idea of being afraid of backlog and not afraid of shortages, paying attention to "buying" and not paying attention to "selling," some stores blindly order plans, and are "rather small than big." A department store in Wuhan only wanted one basketball in its purchase plan, and a department store in Guangzhou only wanted one piece of underwear. The thoughts of the cadres of each station and store are "the goods should be good, the variety should be small, and the quantity should be small." The plan made under this idea will be completely divorced from reality, unable to meet the needs of residents, affect the normal development of production, limit its own commodity circulation and capital turnover, and affect the leadership of the market.

Second, the calculation of expenses is rather big than small, afraid of losing money, afraid of not completing the task of handing over to the higher authorities. Honghu County is only more than 200 miles away from Wuhan, but the regional price difference of general merchandise is as high as 16.44%; Puqi is only six hours away from Wuhan by train, and private merchants can purchase goods in Wuhan and return on the same day, but the regional price difference in Puqi is as high as more than 10%. Increasing the calculation of expenses was originally afraid of losing money, but the effect was the opposite: due to the increase in prices, merchants and consumers did not buy goods locally, which reduced the volume of commodity circulation, and the turnover decreased day by day. There are three or four hundred peddlers in Fengkou Town, Honghu County, but only one-quarter of them buy goods at the Fengkou Sales Office. The sales office only completed 3% of the annual sales plan in the first quarter.

The basic reason for the chaotic phenomenon of plans and prices is that the leading cadres of many units lack a comprehensive economic accounting idea and have not realized that the implementation of economic accounting must be subordinate to national policies and plans. Therefore, the basic key to solving this problem lies in correcting the one-sided economic accounting viewpoint and establishing a comprehensive economic accounting idea. Our business plan, on the one hand, must conform to the requirements of policies and the market, and on the other hand, must conform to the requirements of expanding circulation and accelerating turnover; our prices should be based on expanding commodity circulation and accelerating capital turnover, carefully calculate, reduce expenses, so as to reduce the burden on consumers, and at the same time, expand profits from expanding circulation and accelerating turnover. Only in this way can our plans and prices be correct, conform to the requirements of national policies and plans, and conform to the requirements of the economic accounting system.

III

In the state-owned commercial system, salespeople and storekeepers account for about 60% to 70% of the total number of people, and are two important pillars of state-owned commerce. At present, many salespeople have the following negative thoughts, so their enthusiasm cannot be fully exerted. One is a sense of inferiority, thinking that working behind the counter and doing business has no future; the other is a lazy thought, thinking that there are managers and section chiefs above, it is better to do less than more, and whether the task is completed or not is always the same. These thoughts collectively reflect that the leaders at all levels of the state-owned commercial system lack due care for the vast number of salespeople, and have not given appropriate care to their lives, while neglecting regular political and ideological education. On the salesperson's side, the concept of being the master is not clear, and the idea of wholeheartedly serving the people has not been fully established.

These negative thoughts must be quickly overcome. First of all, leaders at all levels must recognize the pillar role of salespeople in state-owned commercial work, and should always improve their political awareness, care about their learning, care about their lives, overcome the simple use of people without teaching, overcome the bureaucratic leadership style of not caring about the lives of the masses, and solve their specific problems in work and life in a timely manner within the scope of objective conditions, and establish a regular reward system to reward salespeople and storekeepers who perform well in their work in a timely manner. On the other hand, we must clearly rely on the ideas of the masses, learn from them, often consult with them, plans and prices must be discussed by salespeople, establish a regular meeting system, and carry out criticism from the bottom up. The implementation of the economic accounting system is fundamentally based on mobilizing the masses. Without the enthusiasm of the masses, everything will fail.

Secondly, we must educate the vast number of commercial workers and explain that commercial work is a part of the revolutionary work, is a glorious work, and is an important work. To make them clear about the concept of serving the people and serving the national economic construction, establish the idea of being the master, strengthen learning, constantly study business, correct the shortcomings and chaotic phenomena in the work, implement the economic accounting system, and give full play to the due role of each state-owned commercial worker in state-owned commercial work, so as to meet the great upsurge of economic construction.

### 从营业员代表会议看到改进国营商业工作的途径

    从营业员代表会议看到改进国营商业工作的途径
    中南财政经济委员会副主任  曾传六
    中国百货公司武汉百货采购供应批发站于四月里召开了营业员代表会议。这次会议不但对参加会议的营业员是一次生动的政策教育与业务学习，对我们作领导工作的人员来说，也是一次具体的政策教育与业务学习。这次会议所揭露的问题是目前中南区国营商业普遍存在的问题，我们应该针对这些问题提出改进的办法，把国营商业工作向前推进一步。
    一
    会上首先对武汉加工袜子的积压问题作了研究。到目前为止，武汉积压加工袜子计二十二万多打，估计已经调拨出去积压在各基层百货商店的约八万至十万打。把积压的袜子排队的结果：根本不合居民需要的占总数的百分之三十七点五；成本过高，品质低劣，需要削价出售的占百分之五十二点五，可以销售，但过去未与营业员见面的占百分之十。造成积压的原因，表现在以下几个主要方面：
    首先是国营商业为生产与消费服务的思想不明确，许多地区的国营商业单位没有积极地为加工商品打开销路。有些营业员存在着“什么方便卖什么”的名牌货思想，他们手中的非名牌货很难和消费者见面。有的营业员认为只要三不差（货不差、钱不差、报表不差）就行，积压不积压与己无关。有的营业员怕商品多，购买者挑选麻烦；怕晚上盘点麻烦，认为商品多不如商品少些省事。有的国营商店以衙门化作风对待顾客。宋埠有个小商贩四次去宋埠商店都没买到货，他反映说：一去没开门，二去人不空，三去在吃饭，四去已打烊。许多领导干部和计划干部不根据当地需要进货，要货也只要几种名牌货。
    其次，手续制度混乱也促成了加工货的积压。营业部门与保管部门不联系，营业员不知道仓库里存着些什么货、存了多少，保管员不知道门市部缺什么货。有些调拨人员也不按照当地居民的需要恰当地搭配花式与品种，结果，当地要的货没有，调去的货不需要。
    第三，加工定货有盲目性。盲目扶植，盲目加工，而没有根据市场需要，对不同厂商不同的生产设备、技术条件予以分别对待，甚至把许多季节性的工人错误地固定起来，使手工业的季节生产变为常年生产。有些干部脱离现实地把武汉市加工袜子统统换上了百货公司的商标，不考虑群众对商标牌名的习惯需要经过一个较长时期才能改变。另一方面又不积极帮助与督促加工厂改进规格，提高质量，改善经营，降低成本。群众称二十支纱的加工男女踩口线袜为“伸脚散”（上脚就垮），说它的尺码是“大人穿嫌小，小孩穿嫌大”。一九五一年的产品已大量积压，但领导方面却不调查研究，不算细账，又在一九五二年加工了四十多万打。
    不算账不容易知道我们盲目加工、盲目调拨、不积极推销对于人民财产造成了多大的损失。这二十二万多打袜子，积压时间从六个月到两年不等，价格如按成本降低百分之四点八至三十八点八计算，要损失二十八亿元；如再继续积压，每月资金利息即需支付一亿一千万元，全年十三亿元，仓租、保险费等还不计算在内。
    加工袜子积压的事实严重地教育了我们。我们今后首先要学会算账，时时刻刻都要算，领导干部更要算。算出的数字会科学地告诉我们：是符合于国家的利益，还是给国家造成了损失。更要学会调查居民需要、调查在商店供应范围内的购买力，学会研究商品成本、研究推销技术，积极地正确地组织货源，加强加工定货的计划性，大力推销加工货，并督促加工厂改进产品，以达到为生产服务又影响生产的目的。
    二
    会上也反映了许多地区群众需要的毛巾、袜子和其他百货脱销的严重现象。第一季度许多批发站与基层商店在实行经济核算制方面虽然也有成绩，但目前经营上的混乱现象却普遍存在。这些混乱现象主要表现在制订计划与计算价格方面：
    第一、有些商店在怕积压，不怕脱销，注意“买”，不注意“卖”的思想支配下，盲目订计划，并且是“宁小毋大”。武汉一个百货门市部在进货计划中，只要一个篮球，广州有的门市部只要一件卫生衣。各个站和商店干部的思想都是“货要好，品种少，数量小”。在这种思想支配下做出的计划就会完全脱离实际，满足不了居民的需要，影响了生产的正常发展，限制了本身商品流通与资金周转，更影响了对市场的领导。
    第二、计算费用是宁大毋小，怕赔本，怕完不成上缴任务。洪湖县距离武汉只二百多里，一般百货地区差价却高达百分之十六点四四；蒲圻到武汉只有六小时的火车路程，私商到武汉当天可以采购回去，而蒲圻地区差价高达百分之十以上。加高计算费用原是怕赔本，但效果却适得其反：由于价格提高，商贩和消费者都不在当地购货，这就缩小了商品流转额，营业额一天天下降。洪湖县丰口镇有三、四百个货郎担，只有四分之一在丰口营业所买货，该营业所第一季度只完成了全年销货计划的百分之三。
    造成计划与价格混乱现象的基本原因，是由于不少单位的领导干部缺乏全面的经济核算思想，没有认识到实行经济核算必须服从国家政策与服从计划。因此，解决这个问题的基本关键，在于纠正片面的经济核算观点，树立全面的经济核算思想。我们的业务计划，一方面要符合于政策和市场的要求，
    一方面要符合于扩大流通、加速周转的要求；我们的价格，要在扩大商品流通、加速资金周转的基础上，精打细算，降低费用，以减轻消费者的负担，同时，从扩大流通、加速周转来扩大利润。只有这样，我们的计划与价格才是正确的，符合于国家政策和计划要求的，符合于经济核算制的要求的。
    三
    在国营商业系统中，营业员和保管员约占总人数的百分之六十至七十，是国营商业的两个重要支柱。目前许多营业员存在着以下的消极思想，因而积极性不能尽量发挥。一种是自卑思想，认为站柜台做生意，没有前途；另一种是懒惰思想，认为上有经理科长，多一事不如少一事，任务完成完不成总是那么回事。这些思想集中地反映了国营商业系统的各级领导干部对广大营业员缺乏应有的关心，对他们的生活也没有给予适当照顾，同时又忽视了经常的政治思想教育。在营业员方面主人翁观念不明确，全心全意为人民服务的思想还没有完全树立起来。
    这些消极思想必须迅速加以克服。首先，各级领导必须认识营业员在国营商业工作中的支柱作用，应该经常地提高他们的政治觉悟，关心他们的学习，关心他们的生活，克服用而不教的单纯使用观点，克服不关心群众生活的官僚主义领导作风，及时地在客观条件可能范围之内解决他们工作和生活上的具体问题，并建立经常的奖励制度，对工作优良的营业员和保管员及时给予奖励。另一方面必须明确依靠群众的思想，向他们学习，经常和他们商量，计划和价格要经过营业员讨论，建立定期会议制度，开展自下而上的批评。经济核算制的贯彻执行，基本关键在于发动群众，经济核算制没有群众的积极性，一切就会落空。
    其次，我们必须教育广大的商业工作人员，说明商业工作是革命工作的一部分，是光荣的工作，是重要的工作。使他们明确为人民服务，为国家经济建设服务的观念，树立主人翁思想，加强学习，不断地钻研业务，纠正工作中的缺点和混乱现象，贯彻经济核算制，发挥每个国营商业工作人员在国营商业工作中的应有作用，以迎接伟大经济建设高潮。
