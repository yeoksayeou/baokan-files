	Combat Friendship Forged in Blood
	—Written to Commemorate the Third Anniversary of the Great Korean People's War Against Aggression
	Chen Yi
	The three-year Korean War has promoted and consolidated the combat friendship forged in blood between the Chinese and Korean people. Recalling it at this time, I feel it has a particularly profound meaning.
	Yes, it is this combat friendship forged in blood between the two peoples that has turned the war from its most difficult years to victory.
	I remember when I arrived in Korea in the spring of 1951, it was just before the Fifth Campaign was about to begin. Although the enemy had been pushed back to the 38th parallel, the war situation was still in a difficult stage. This difficulty was not that our soldiers could not defeat the enemy, but that our transportation lines were obstructed, food and ammunition could not be delivered, and the wounded could not be evacuated. As the soldiers said, it was a time of "a handful of fried flour and a handful of snow." At that time, the Korean people, under the leadership of General Kim Il-sung, were fighting the enemy on the one hand and supporting our Volunteer Army comrades on the other. Friendship, "Long live the combat friendship forged in blood between the Chinese and Korean people!" This slogan could be seen everywhere.
	In a village in Chunghwa County, south of Pyongyang, I shed tears of gratitude the first time a middle-aged woman spoke to me. She said, "I recall the past with gratitude. Last November, if your Volunteer Army had not crossed the river, the fate of me and my country would have been unimaginable." On the eve of our Volunteer Army's attack on Pyongyang, her husband, a Labor Party member and village head, was shot by the US-Li bandit army for organizing guerrilla warfare, and she was also imprisoned. Our troops liberated Pyongyang, the US-Li bandit army fled in panic, and she was saved. Tell me, how could she not shed tears of gratitude? And at that time, I thought: If it were not for them—the thousands of heroic sons and daughters of Korea, using their blood to block the enemy on their land, and preventing the enemy from burning the flames of war to our country's Northeast, the people of our country would also have suffered the disaster of war; thinking about it, I also shed tears of gratitude to her. When I came back from visiting her, I found that it was not just her alone, but a group of people on the highway, carrying earth on their heads, children on their backs, and using their hands to repair roads for our Volunteer Army. Although we could not communicate through language, looking at their expressions, looking at their tense and serious faces, I could not help but feel a sense of respect and love in my heart. And I felt that the Volunteer Army in Korea was truly with their own brothers and sisters.
	"Comrades! Brothers! Although you are in a foreign country, you have foreign brothers and sisters to help you, and you will be the same as in your motherland."
	Many Volunteer Army soldiers fought bravely, even sacrificing themselves, for the Korean people's love. Here, I recall even more the words written to me by a seventy-year-old Korean man in Marshal Kim Il-sung's hometown—Mangyongdae:
	"The sea may dry up, the rocks may crumble, but the combat friendship forged in blood between the Chinese and Korean people will never be broken!"
	He could not speak Chinese, but he had read many Chinese books, he understood China, and he was good at using Chinese idioms to explain the fraternal relationship between China and Korea. We had a two-hour conversation in writing, and the above words were what he wrote and gave to me after our conversation.
	Subsequent facts have further proved the words of this old man.
	The second time I met Comrade Xu Jiayi at the Volunteer Army Headquarters, we hugged for three minutes, while our first meeting was only a dozen minutes, and it can be said that we didn't even talk about anything. Why could we do this? It is because this combat friendship, this combat friendship forged in blood, has closely linked every fighting Chinese and Korean person together. Anyone who has been to Korea, whether in the front or the rear, whether day or night, as long as they mention that they are from China, they will receive the warmest hospitality.
	Back in the motherland, Ambassador Kwon O-jik hosted us, and talking to him was just like being in Korea, without feeling that this was the Embassy of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in the People's Republic of China.
	These things again remind me that on the front lines, even just five or six li behind a forward position, or in a place where the Volunteer Army is stationed regularly, we Volunteer Army soldiers cannot tell that we are in a foreign country. The glorious tradition of the people's army of our country—supporting the government and cherishing the people—is vividly in front of our eyes: there are no quarrels, no disputes, completely the same as in the motherland. I think, if you have been stationed in the army in the motherland and have frequent contact with the local people, you will feel the deep military-civilian relationship of our Volunteer Army in Korea.
	Less than half a li behind an artillery position on the front line, there are three thatched houses. The crops in front of the thatched houses are lush and green, and there is also an irrigation ditch, which can be seen to have been newly dug not long ago, even in the moonlight at night. The artillery regiment commander told me: "This is their greatest comfort in the midst of the war!" Although the owners of these three thatched houses are just an old man, four women, and two children, making up three generations.
	The regimental commander said:
	"Think about it! Relatives from the motherland! If they can't see you, they are our closest relatives!"
	At the beginning, the regimental commander and political commissar had advised them to move to a farther place, but none of them agreed. The second daughter-in-law, who participated in the Democratic Youth League, stubbornly said to the political commissar:
	"Where to go! Comrade! This is where my husband set off to fight the enemy, I can't move farther and farther away from him! He will return victoriously."
	The old man also said:
	"This is the land allocated to me by the Labor Party, I cannot give it up!"
	The eldest daughter—a Labor Party member—added:
	"Also, comrades, you are blocking the enemy for us, where else can we go!"
	The regimental commander and political commissar did not answer anything further, and immediately gained strength:
	"Fight bravely for them, and also for our motherland!"
	"We must protect them to the end, so that their homes can prosper in the midst of the war!"
	The thoughts of the regimental commander and political commissar became the actions of every soldier in the artillery regiment. From then on, every shell hit the mark, and the higher-ups praised them for their good coordination with the infantry. And that irrigation ditch, the irrigation ditch seen in the moonlight, was the work of all the comrades in the artillery regiment for four nights.
	Tomatoes and spinach were harvested. This was what the artillery regiment helped them plant. When I visited this artillery regiment, this was the most interesting and educational thing that our political commissar talked about in the combat stories.
	The soldiers have no selfishness at all. When building houses, they chop down trees while saying to the Korean people:
	"This is being built for you. When the war is over and we return home, you can move in."
	The higher-ups also said to the Korean comrades in charge in a certain place:
	"The houses around us, when the war is over in the future, please move in first! Settle down and work first, and then slowly build your city!"
	The great Chinese people, the Chinese people under the leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong, will use all their strength to help Korea recover after the war, just as they used their blood to aid the Korean people.
	The war cannot destroy the iron will of the two peoples, and the war has further promoted the combat friendship forged in blood between the two peoples. This friendship will be forever—consolidated for thousands of generations! If this friendship has once guaranteed the victory of the battle in the battle, it will also consolidate the victory in peace! If the warmongers want to gain a little advantage in the middle of this, and play tricks, this combat friendship forged in blood between the two peoples will give it a heavier double blow than before!
	I believe this, I think the people of our two countries and the soldiers of the two countries fighting on the front lines will also believe this, and our enemies cannot but believe it from many lessons!
	Let us recall again the words written to me by the seventy-year-old man in Marshal Kim Il-sung's hometown—Mangyongdae:
		"The sea may dry up, the rocks may crumble, but the combat friendship forged in blood between the Chinese and Korean people will never be broken!"
	Long live the combat friendship forged in blood between the Chinese and Korean people!

    用血结成的战斗友谊
    ——为纪念伟大的朝鲜人民反侵略战争三周年而作
    陈沂
    历时三年的朝鲜战争，促进并巩固了中朝两国人民用血结成的战斗友谊，这时候来回忆一下，我感觉得意味特别深长。
    是的，就是这个两国人民用血结成的战斗友谊，才使战争由最艰苦的年代转到胜利。
    记得我一九五一年春天到朝鲜，那时还是第五次战役快要开始的时候，虽说敌人已被我们打回三八线，但战局还是处在艰难的阶段。这个困难并不是我们的战士打不过敌人，而是我们的交通线受到阻碍，粮食弹药送不上去，伤兵拉不下来，借用战士的话，就是“一把炒面一把雪”的时候。那时候的朝鲜人民在金日成将军领导之下，一方面同敌人进行斗争，一方面支援我们志愿军同志。友谊，“中朝两国人民用血结成的战斗友谊万岁”这个标语到处都可以见到。
    在平壤南中和郡的一个乡村里，第一次一个中年妇女向我谈话时，我流了感激的眼泪。她说：“我用感激的心情来回忆过去，去年十一月，如果不是你们的志愿军过江来，我和我的祖国的命运都不堪设想。”在我们志愿军打到平壤的前夕，她的丈夫劳动党员、里委员长因组织游击战争被美李匪军枪毙，而她亦被关起来。我们的队伍解放了平壤，美李匪军仓惶逃走，她得救了。你说，她怎能不流下感激的眼泪呢？而我那时候想：如果没有她们——万千的朝鲜英雄儿女，在他们的土地上，用血挡着敌人，而让敌人把战火烧到我们祖国的东北，我国的人民也将遭到战争的灾难；想着，我也向她流了感激的泪。我在访问她回来的时候，我发现不只是她一个人，而是一群人在公路上，头顶着土，背上背着孩子，用双手为我们志愿军修路。话说不通，看表情，看那个紧张严肃的面孔，由不得自己心里发生一种敬爱感情。并且觉得志愿军在朝鲜正是和自己的兄弟姊妹在一起。
    “同志们！兄弟们！你们虽在外国，但有外国兄弟姊妹们帮助你们，你们是会跟在祖国一样的。”
    多少志愿军战士们，几乎没有一个不是为朝鲜人民的这种热爱而挺身战斗，甚至挺身牺牲。这里，我更回想起在金日成元帅故乡——万金台，一个七十岁的朝鲜老人写给我的字：
    “海可枯，石可烂，中朝两国人民用血结成的战斗友谊永不断！”
    他不会说中国话，他读过很多中国书，他懂得中国，他也善于利用中国的古语来说明中朝两国的兄弟关系。我们曾进行过两小时的笔谈，上面的话就是我们笔谈后他书赠给我的。
    以后的事实越发证明了这位老人的话。
    我第二次在志愿军司令部遇到许嘉谊同志，我们拥抱了三分钟之久，而我们第一次的见面只不过是十几分钟，可以说连话都没有谈什么。为什么能够这样呢？就是因为这个战斗友谊，用血结成的这个战斗友谊，把我们每一个战斗的中国人、朝鲜人都紧紧的连在一起了。凡是到过朝鲜的人，不论在前方或后方，不管是白天黑夜，只要一提起是中国来的，就会受到最热情的款待。
    回到祖国，权五稷大使招待我们，谈起来就跟在朝鲜一样，丝毫没有感到这是在朝鲜民主主义人民共和国驻中华人民共和国的大使馆。
    这些，又使我想起在前线，那怕就是在一个前沿阵地的后面五六里，或在经常驻着志愿军的地方，我们志愿军就看不出是在外国。我国人民军队的光荣传统——拥政爱民的情景历历在目：没有争吵，没有纠纷，完全跟在祖国一样。我想，你如果是在祖国驻过军，同老乡经常接触过，你就会感到我们志愿军在朝鲜深厚的军民关系。
    在前线一个炮兵阵地的后边不到半里，有三家草房，草房前面的庄稼，长得又青又绿，还有一道引水沟，虽是在夜晚的月光下，也看得出是新挖不久的。炮兵团长告诉我：“这是他们在战火纷飞中最大的安慰！”虽说这三家草房里面的主人不过是一个老头，四个妇女，两个小孩，算起来是三代的人。
    团长说：
    “想想吧！祖国来的亲人！看不见你们，他们就是我们最亲的亲人了！”
    开始团长和政委都曾劝过他们搬到远一点的地方去，但是他们谁都没有答应，参加民主青年同盟的二儿媳妇倔强地向政委说：
    “哪去呀！同志！这是我丈夫去打敌人时出发的地方，我不能越离他越远呀！他是会胜利回来的。”
    老头也说：
    “这是劳动党分给我的土地，我不能放弃！”
    大女儿——劳动党员补充了一句：
    “还有，同志们，你们在为我们挡住敌人，我们还要到什么地方去呀！”
    团长和政委再没有回答什么，身上马上增添了力量：
    “为他们，也是为我们祖国，英勇战斗吧！”
    “要把他们保卫到底，要他们的家在战火纷飞中繁荣！”
    团长和政委的思想，变成了炮兵团每个战士的行动。从此弹无虚发，上级嘉奖他们协同步兵作战配合得很好。而那条引水沟，在月光下看到的引水沟，就是炮兵团全体同志四夜的劳作。
    收割下来了，有西红柿，还有菠菜，这是炮兵团帮助他们种的。当我访问这个炮兵团的时候，这是我们政委所谈的战斗故事中最感兴趣、也是受教育最大的一件事。
    战士们没有一点私心，盖房子的时候，一边伐木，一边对朝鲜人民说：
    “这是给你们盖的，战争结束，我们回国，你们就搬来住吧。”
    上级也向某地朝鲜负责同志说过：
    “我们这周围的房子，将来战争结束，就请你们先搬来吧！先住下办公，再慢慢建设你们的城！”
    伟大的中国人民，毛泽东主席领导下的中国人民，将像用自己的血援助朝鲜人民一样，战后还要用一切力量来帮助朝鲜恢复。
    战争摧毁不了两国人民的钢铁意志，战争更促进了两国人民用血结成的战斗友谊，这个友谊将永远——千秋万代的巩固下去！如果说，这个友谊曾经在战斗中保证了战斗的胜利，同样的也将在和平中巩固胜利！战争贩子要想在这中间讨点便宜，耍个花招，这个两国人民用血结成的战斗友谊将会给它比以前更沉重的双倍打击！
    我这样相信，我想我们两国的人民和战斗在前线的两国将士也会这样相信，而我们的敌人从多次教训中也不能不相信！
    让我们再把金日成元帅故乡——万金台七十老人书赠我的字再回忆一遍：
       “海可枯，石可烂，中朝两国人民用血结成的战斗友谊永不断！”
    中朝两国人民用血结成的战斗友谊万岁！
