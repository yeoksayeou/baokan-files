Why Hasn't the Wudaoku Branch of the Yichun Forest Industry Bureau Paid Wages for Months?
Cao Minfei

Not being able to receive wages on time is a common complaint among workers in the Yichun Forestry Area. The most serious situation is at the Wudaoku Branch of the Yichun Forest Industry Bureau. During peak work periods, the branch has often had more than 8,000 workers, and it is common for them to go two consecutive months without receiving wages. Therefore, the workers complain: the Forestry Bureau is deceiving us, only wanting us to complete tasks without paying us.

What is the reason for not paying workers for months at a time? The main reasons are as follows:

    Alarming Waste, Increasing Timber Costs

The work at the Yichun Wudaoku Branch lacks planning, and they do whatever comes next. Leading cadres are only satisfied with completing tasks numerically, forgetting to manage funds and control costs, thus causing costs to rise without limit, directly affecting the availability of funds to pay wages. The branch has not properly repaired transportation routes, and the clothing, provisions, and production tools for thousands of people are all carried by people. At most, up to seven hundred workers carried these items every day. According to statistics from six work sites, more than 80,000 workdays were used last year, totaling 2.1 billion yuan in wages. This amounts to about 6,000 yuan per cubic meter of timber, and this waste is a fundamental factor in increasing costs. Excessive use of miscellaneous workers is also a reason for increasing costs. The six work sites used more than 220,000 miscellaneous workers, spending more than 5.2 billion yuan in wages. Again, allocating this based on the timber figures completed by the six work sites, it amounts to more than 13,000 yuan per cubic meter. In addition, responsible persons at each work site do not conscientiously implement national regulations and arbitrarily lower the forest stand grades and quotas for various projects, which also increases expenses. They subjectively believe that the forest stand grades are too high, and without deeply investigating the actual stand volume, they downgrade first-class forest stands to second-class, or second-class to third-class. As a result, each cubic meter of timber produced requires an additional expense of 1,500 yuan, because the lower the forest stand grade, the lower the project quota, and the higher the wage standard. It is also common to arbitrarily lower the quotas stipulated by the state. The Qianying Work Site of the branch lowered the quota for installing tractor pulling force by 10% without any basis; the Miaoling Work Site also subjectively lowered the quota for watering the ice road water tank from sixteen tanks to fourteen tanks. As a result, the timber production cost of the branch greatly exceeded the state's regulations. The cost approved by the state is 162,000 yuan per cubic meter of timber, which includes the total cost of felling, transportation, and rafting. However, in reality, the cost of felling and transportation alone was 159,440 yuan, resulting in an increase of more than 50,000 yuan per cubic meter of timber.

    Uncertain Project Quotas, No Wage Standards

The branch has not promptly determined the quotas for each project and does not have fixed wage standards, so it is afraid to make timely payments. The branch decided that the Houying Work Site should carry out a large-scale forest stand cleanup after felling, and the 17th Team of the work site was responsible for this task. However, no quota was set for this large-scale cleanup project, and the work site did not know the wage standard, so it dared not make payments even if it had the money. Later, the workers inquired, and the work site asked the higher authorities, and the answer was to study it. After a period of time, the work site asked the branch director again, and the branch director told them to ask the Afforestation Section of the Yichun Management Bureau. At that time, Wu Zhanyuan, the head of the Afforestation Section, happened to be down inspecting afforestation work, but he said that this issue should be the responsibility of the Wage Section and that they should be consulted. The Wage Section said that it should be handled by the Afforestation Section. They kept pushing it back and forth, and it dragged on for more than four months. Later, the 106 workers of the 17th Team wrote a collective appeal and reported it all the way from the grassroots trade union to the Northeast Forestry Department at that time, but the problem was never solved. Later, Li, the director of the Yichun Forest Industry Bureau, came to the branch to inspect the work and jointly studied the issue with Su, the director of the branch, and solved the problem by paying basic felling wages, but the quota for the large-scale cleanup was still not set, and the wage standard was still not determined.

    Unplanned Increase in Task Numbers, Expanded Scope of Expenses

The leading cadres of the branch believed that producing more was better than producing less, so they consciously increased the tasks, but they did not take into account the cost constraints. Their excess was not achieved on the basis of reducing costs, so the wages for the excess part could not be reimbursed, which of course affected the workers' pay. Last year, the Wudaoku Branch exceeded the total task by 11.3 percent, which on the surface seems to be an achievement, but if one studies how it was exceeded, then problems arise. It was not achieved by fully utilizing the workers' labor efficiency, improving tools, or having inventions and creations, or improving management methods and other cost-reducing conditions, so this expenditure figure was increased outside the plan, which affected the workers' ability to receive wages on time.

    伊春森林工业局五道库分局为什么一连数月不发工资
    曹敏飞
    不能按时领到工资，这是伊春林区工人的普遍反映。其中情况最严重的，要数伊春森林工业局五道库分局。该分局在作业紧张时期，工人常在八千名以上，而连续两个月不发工资，是很平常的事。因此，工人们反映说：林务局骗人，光让完成任务不给工薪。
    究竟为什么一连数月不给工人发工资呢？主要原因有以下几个：
    惊人的浪费，提高了木材成本
    伊春五道库分局的工作没有计划，干到那儿算那儿。领导干部只满足于完成数字上的任务，而忘掉了掌握资金和控制成本，因而使成本无限制的提高，直接影响到工资无款开付。这个分局没有修好运输道，几千人的被服、粮秣及生产工具全由人背。背这些东西的工人最多时每天达七百人。据六个作业所的统计：去年共用了八万多工，合计工资二十一亿多元，每立方公尺木材约摊六千多元，这项浪费是提高成本的基本因素。杂工过多，也是提高成本的原因之一。六个作业所共用杂工二十二万多个，开支工薪人民币五十二亿多元，仍以六个作业所完成的木材数字来分配，每立方公尺摊一万三千多元。另外，各作业现场的负责人不认真执行国家的规定，随意降低林场等级与各项工程定额，也使得开支增加了。他们主观地认为林场等级划分过高，并不深入调查单位蓄积量究有多少，便将一等林场降为二等林场，或将二等林场降为三等林场，这样一来，每生产一立方公尺木材就要多开支一千五百元，因为林场等级越低，工程定额也随着低，而工资标准就提高了。随便降低国家所规定的定额也是常有的事。该分局前营作业所竟毫无根据地将装拖拉机扒力的定额按规定降低百分之十；庙岭作业所也主观地将浇冰道水箱定额由十六箱降到十四箱。这样，该分局的木材生产成本就大大超过了国家的规定。国家批准的成本每立方公尺木材是十六万二千元，这里包括采伐、运搬及流送等生产过程的总费用。但实际上仅在采、运两阶段就用了十五万九千四百四十元，结果使每立方公尺木材提高成本五万多元。
    不确定工程定额，没有工资标准
    该分局没有及时确定每项工程的定额，没有一定的工资标准，因此不敢及时开支。该分局决定后营作业所要在采伐后进行林场大清理，该所十七工队担负了这个任务。但这项大清理的工程却没有确定定额，作业所不知道工资标准，就是有钱也不敢开支。后来工人追问，作业所便请示上级，得到的答复是研究研究。过了一个时期，作业所又请问分局局长，分局局长让问伊春管理局抚育科。当时抚育科武占元科长恰巧下来检查抚育工作，但他说，这个问题应由工薪科负责，要请示他们。工薪科又说由抚育科处理。就这样你推给我，我推给你，一直拖了四个多月。后来十七工队一百零六名工人写了控诉书集体联名上告，由基层工会一直转到当时的东北林业部，问题始终没有解决。后来伊春森林工业局李局长到分局检查工作，才和分局粟局长共同研究，按采伐基本工资解决了这个问题，但大清理的定额还是没有，工资标准仍未确定。
    无计划地增加任务数字，开支范围扩大
    该分局的领导干部认为多生产比少生产好，就有意识地把任务提高一些，但却没有顾及到成本的限制。他们的超额不是在降低成本的基础上实现的，其超额部分的工资就无法报销，当然就影响了工人的发薪。五道库分局去年按总任务超额完成百分之十一点三，这在表面上看来是个成绩，但如果研究
    一下是怎样超额的，那就发生问题了。它不是在充分发挥了工人的劳动效率，改进了工具，或有发明创造，或改善经营方法等降低成本的条件下超额完成生产任务的，因此，这种开支数字是在计划之外增加的，这样就影响工人不能按时领取工资。
