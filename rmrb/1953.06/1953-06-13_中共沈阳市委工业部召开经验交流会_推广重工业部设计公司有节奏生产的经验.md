    The CPC Shenyang Municipal Committee Industry Department Holds Experience Exchange Meeting
    To Promote the Experience of Rhythmic Production in the Design Company of the Ministry of Heavy Industry
    In order to improve the efficiency and quality of design work and ensure the smooth completion of basic construction tasks, the CPC Shenyang Municipal Committee Industry Department held an experience exchange conference on May 28 to introduce the advanced experience of the Design Company of the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry in promoting "organized rhythmic production according to indicator charts." Responsible cadres from the Party, administration, trade union, and Communist Youth League of the city's design departments, as well as engineering design personnel, a total of 269 people, attended the meeting. Jiao Ruoyu, Mayor of the Shenyang Municipal People's Government, also participated in the meeting and gave a speech.
    At the meeting, Guan Wenxuan, a comrade from the Electrical Lighting Section of the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry Design Company, introduced the experience and achievements gained by the section since promoting the advanced experience of "organized rhythmic production according to indicator charts." Since its establishment in November last year, the Electrical Lighting Section had been experiencing chaotic and passive work, mainly due to a lack of strong planning and management. The design efficiency and quality of the section had been consistently low. According to the quota, each person should complete 3,300 square meters of design work per month, but they averaged at most just over 2,000 square meters, and the design quality was also poor. For example, designing the lighting for a 30,000-square-meter project should normally require only five people to complete it within a month, but they used fifteen people and spent forty days to barely complete it, and were still in a state of hectic disarray. Due to the lack of planning, there were frequent occurrences of chaotic work and situations where work was initially slack and then rushed later. For example, drawings that should have been done by one person were sometimes done by two people in order to rush the task, resulting in skewed and crooked drawings that had to be reworked, and as a result, design tasks could not be completed on time.
    In order to solve the problems of chaotic production and failure to complete design tasks, the section took the set of indicator charts promoted by the Design Department of Anshan Iron and Steel Company for study. However, at that time, only a few leading cadres roughly studied it without clearly explaining the advantages of the indicator charts to the masses and organizing mass discussions, which resulted in detours in the promotion. Some people believed: "The indicator charts are pretty good, but they are only suitable for factory production. Design work uses the brain and is not easy to use." Others said: "Drawing that stuff is too troublesome. It's better to do more design with that time." As a result, it could not be promoted, and the work remained chaotic. In light of this situation, the company and the leadership of the Lighting Section seriously summarized the lessons learned from promoting the indicator charts and found that it was not that the advanced experience of "organized rhythmic production according to indicator charts" was not applicable to design work, but that the mass discussion was not well organized and there was a lack of mass foundation. Therefore, they reorganized all personnel to study conscientiously, so that everyone had a clear understanding in their minds; then, they mobilized the masses to formulate detailed plans. In order to facilitate the promotion of indicator charts and overcome uneven workloads and idleness, the organization of labor was appropriately changed.
    Since then, design efficiency has generally improved. In the past, each person could only complete an average of 2,000 square meters of design tasks per month, but now it has increased to more than 7,000 square meters, and technically skilled workers can reach 12,000 square meters per month. The average efficiency has more than quadrupled compared to the past. In terms of quality, there has also been a great improvement due to the formulation of quality indicator charts and the establishment of various responsibility systems and audit systems, and the phenomenon of rework has been greatly reduced. For example, the design of a standard dormitory with an area of 30,000 square meters used to take fifteen people forty days, but now it can be completed by five people in thirty days. In the past, the section often felt that there was a shortage of manpower and worked overtime, but now not only do they feel that there are enough people and the work is easier, but they are also confident in completing the 1954 electrical lighting design tasks (the 1954 tasks will be three times more than in 1953). Along with the promotion of the advanced experience of indicator charts, the technical level of each technician has also gradually improved; even Zhang Yingbin and Chen Guozhong, who had just graduated from school and had never done more complex "three-phase four-wire" concealed conduit engineering design, successfully completed their tasks this time through the implementation of indicator charts. Therefore, all six major and minor projects designed by the section in April were completed ahead of schedule.
    Mayor Jiao Ruoyu emphasized at the meeting: The experience of "organized rhythmic production according to indicator charts" is an advanced Soviet experience, and this advanced management method not only plays a promoting role in factory production, but also applies to design departments. In order to improve design efficiency and quality and make design keep up with construction needs, the leading cadres of various design departments must conscientiously organize the masses to study this advanced experience well after returning, and promote this experience in a planned and step-by-step manner.

    中共沈阳市委工业部召开经验交流会
    推广重工业部设计公司有节奏生产的经验
    为了提高设计工作效率和质量，保证基本建设任务的顺利完成，中共沈阳市委工业部于五月二十八日召开了介绍中央重工业部设计公司推行“按指示图表组织有节奏生产”的先进经验交流大会。到会的有该市各设计部门的党、行政、工会、青年团负责干部及工程设计人员，共二百六十九人。沈阳市人民政府焦若愚市长也参加了大会，并在大会上讲了话。
    会上由中央重工业部设计公司电气照明科关文萱同志介绍了该科在推行“按指示图表组织有节奏生产”先进经验以来取得的经验和成绩。电气照明科从去年十一月成立以来，工作混乱被动，主要原因是缺乏强有力的计划管理。该科设计效率和质量一直很低，按定额每人每月应完成三千三百平方公尺的设计任务，但是他们平均最多只完成两千多平方公尺，设计质量也很差。如有一次设计一个三万平方公尺的工程照明，按一般标准只需五个人在一个月以内就能完成，可是他们用了十五个人费了四十天的时间才勉强完成，并且弄得手忙脚乱。由于工作没有计划，也经常发生工作忙乱和前松后紧的现象，如本来应由一个人画的图纸，有时为了突击任务竟由两个人来画，设计出来的图纸歪的歪斜的斜，最后还得返工，因而经常不能完成设计任务。
    该科为了解决生产忙乱和完不成设计任务的问题，曾把鞍山钢铁公司设计处推行的一套指示图表拿来学习。由于当时只是几个领导干部大致研究了
    一下，没有将指示图表的优越性向群众交代清楚并组织群众讨论，结果在推行中走了弯路。有的人认为：“指示图表倒是挺好，但它只适用于工厂生产，设计工作是用脑子的事，不好用。”也有的说：“画那玩艺多麻烦，有那时间还不如多搞些设计。”因此推行不动，而工作仍然忙乱。根据这种情况该公司及照明科的领导方面认真总结了推行指示图表的教训，找出了不是“按指示图表组织有节奏生产”的先进经验不适用于设计工作，而是没有很好的组织群众讨论，缺乏群众基础。因此他们重新组织全体人员认真学习，使大家在思想上有了明确的认识；接着，又发动群众制订了周密计划。为了便于推行指示图表，克服忙闲不均和窝工现象，适当地改变了劳动组织。
    从此设计效率普遍提高，过去平均每人每月只能完成两千平方公尺的设计任务，现在已提高到七千多平方公尺，技术熟练的每月竟可达到一万二千平方公尺。平均效率超过过去四倍。在质量上由于制订了质量指示图表和建立了各项责任制和审核制，也有很大提高，返工现象比过去大大减少。如面积三万平方公尺的标准宿舍设计，过去得十五个人干四十天，现在五个人用三十天的时间就可完成。过去该科经常感到人力不足，加班加点，可是现在不但感到人够了，工作轻松了，并且有了完成一九五四年电气照明设计任务的把握（一九五四年任务将比一九五三年增加三倍）。随着推行指示图表先进经验的同时，也逐渐提高了每个技术员的技术水平；甚至像新从学校出来的张英斌、陈帼忠过去没做过比较复杂的“三相四线制”的暗管工程设计，经这次实行指示图表，也胜利完成了任务。因此四月份该科设计的大小六个工程都提前完成了任务。
    焦若愚市长在会上着重指出：“按指示图表组织有节奏生产”的经验，是苏联的先进经验，这个先进的管理方法不仅在工厂生产中起了推动作用，同时也适用于设计部门。为了提高设计效率和质量，使设计赶上施工需要，各设计部门领导干部回去后，一定要认真组织群众很好的学习这一先进经验，并要有计划有步骤地推广这一经验。
