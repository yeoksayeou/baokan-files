    Wuhan Department Store Wholesale Station Convenes Sales Representative Meeting
    Generally Revises Second and Third Quarter Sales Plans
    The Wuhan Purchasing and Supply Wholesale Station of the China Department Store Company convened a meeting of sales representatives from twenty-seven counties and cities within its supply area on April 21st.
    The meeting first studied the reasons for the backlog of processed socks in Wuhan over the past three years and provided many suggestions for improving processing work. At the meeting, sales representatives reported that there was a serious shortage of towels, socks, and other general merchandise needed by the masses in many areas. Sales representatives from Honghu and Xinzhou counties in Hubei Province said: In the past, the superior company allocated us Queen and Pacific brand towels costing more than 9,000 yuan each, but the peasants didn't need them; the mid-range goods they needed were often out of stock. The largest number of out-of-stock general merchandise in Wuhan reached 327 types, and the masses reflected that the department store had become a "shortage company." The sales representatives analyzed that the main reason for this phenomenon was that leading cadres at all levels one-sidedly implemented the economic accounting system. They believed that economic accounting meant “making money” and “not allowing stockpiles.” As a result, they only saw their own “profit-making tasks” and did not consider the serious political task of supplying the market to ensure the needs of the residents. They were only willing to increase profits from prices and did not consider expanding commodity circulation and reducing costs to expand profits. They formulated purchase plans that were smaller rather than larger, and calculated prices that were higher rather than lower. As a result, it not only hindered the normal development of their own business but also affected the supply to the market. The sales representatives criticized this one-sided view of economic accounting and stated that in the future they would strengthen their studies, guarantee the needs of the masses, expand commodity circulation, accelerate capital turnover, carefully calculate expenses, reduce costs, and expand profits to ensure the completion of plans and remittance tasks.
    The meeting combined reports, discussions, exhibitions, and visits to warehouses. By visiting the exhibition and the warehouse, the sales representatives directly met the goods and studied commodity performance, quality, and sales techniques, thereby criticizing the idea of famous brands. The towel and sock exhibition displayed 213 kinds of socks and 132 kinds of towels in five halls, comparing Shanghai goods with Wuhan-processed goods, and famous brands with non-famous brands in terms of price (the average price of Wuhan-processed socks has been reduced by about 15%), size, color, and weight. Through the comparison method, it was proven by facts that the quality of many non-famous brands and some processed goods was not lower than that of famous brands, and the price was even lower than that of famous brands. For example, the "39" Pacific towel and the Donghu towel produced in Wuhan have similar reed counts, densities, colors, and specifications, and the weight of the latter exceeds that of the former, but the selling price is 6% lower. In the exhibition, the trademarks of goods from various regions and factories were removed, and the sales representatives were asked to identify them. Because there was no difference in quality, color, and other aspects between many famous brands and non-famous brands, it was difficult to distinguish between famous brands and non-famous brands. One sales representative said: It turns out that famous brands are not all good products, and our "famous brand" mentality is mainly to blame. When visiting the warehouse, the sales representatives were very nervous when they saw a large number of stockpiled processed socks. The representative from Honghu County said: "If I hadn't seen this, I wouldn't have seen how bureaucratism harms people to such an extent!" The representative from Sui County said: "The 160-needle single-yarn women's socks processed in Wuhan were out of stock in our county in the second half of last year. When we asked the higher-ups for goods, they said they didn't have them. How strange, there are more than 34,000 dozen stockpiled in the warehouse!" After the sales representatives met the goods, they unanimously discussed ways to find sales channels for processed goods: (1) Internal exchanges between counties, between counties and stations, and between stations, and regional adjustments are made according to the needs of the masses in different regions; (2) Reasonable price adjustments; (3) Changing colors, such as printing colorful flowers on white towels and dyeing socks; (4) Strengthening publicity to consumers: comparing goods, comparing prices, comparing quality, and vigorously promoting sales. At the same time, the sales representatives unanimously proposed "three transformations" to guarantee – salespersons become propagandists, slow-selling goods become hot-selling goods, and non-famous brands become famous brands.
    The sales representatives criticized incorrect ideas, met directly with the goods, studied sales techniques, and re-examined the sales plan. According to the needs of the masses and the inventory and supply of goods at the Wuhan Wholesale Station, in addition to selling more than 138,000 dozen processed socks and 18,000 dozen processed towels, the sales plans for the second and third quarters were generally revised. The average increase in socks in the second quarter for each county was 28.56%, and the increase in the third quarter was 32.36%; the increase in towels in the second quarter was 5.3%, and the increase in the third quarter was 14.69%. For example, Jianli County originally planned to sell 14,000 dozen socks, but increased it to 16,000 dozen. In revising the plan, the needs of local residents were studied and analyzed, providing a basis for the wholesale station to organize the supply of goods in the future.    (Jin Wu)

### 武汉百货批发站召开营业员代表会议  普遍修正了第二、三季度销售计划

    武汉百货批发站召开营业员代表会议
    普遍修正了第二、三季度销售计划
    中国百货公司武汉百货采购供应批发站于四月二十一日召开了供应范围内二十七个县市的营业员代表会议。
    会议首先对武汉三年来加工袜子积压的原因作了研究，并提供了很多改进加工工作的意见。在会上，营业员代表们反映了目前许多地区群众需要的毛巾、袜子和其他百货严重脱销的现象。湖北省洪湖、新洲县的营业员代表说：过去上级公司把九千多元一条的皇后、太平洋毛巾调给我们，可是农民不需要；他们需要的中档货却经常没有。武汉脱销的百货最多曾达到三百二十七种，群众反映百货公司变成了“缺货公司”。营业员代表们分析这一现象发生的主要原因，是领导干部以至各级干部片面执行经济核算制。他们认为经济核算就是
    “赚钱”，“不能积压”。于是，只看到自己“赚钱任务”，而不考虑供应市场保证居民需要的严重政治任务，只愿意从价格上加大利润而不考虑从扩大商品流转、降低费用来扩大利润；制订要货计划是宁小毋大，计算价格是宁大毋小，结果，既妨害了本身业务的正常开展，又影响了对市场的供应。营业员代表批判了这种片面经济核算的观点，并表示：今后要加强学习，要从保证群众需要，扩大商品流通，加速资金周转，在费用上精打细算，降低成本，扩大利润来保证计划与上缴任务的完成。
    会议采取报告、讨论、展览、参观仓库相结合的方式进行。营业员通过参观展览和参观仓库，与商品直接见面，研究了商品性能、质量与推销技术，从而批判了名牌货思想。毛巾、袜子展览会把二百一十三种袜子和一百三十二种毛巾陈列了五个馆，以上海货与武汉加工货，名牌货与非名牌货来比价格（武汉加工袜子已平均削价百分之十五左右），比尺码，比花色，比分量。通过比的办法，用事实证明很多非名牌和部分加工货的品质并不低于名牌货，价格还要低于名牌货。如“三九”太平洋毛巾与武汉生产的东湖毛巾，筘门、密度、花色、规格都相仿，后者的重量还超过前者，售价却低百分之六。展览中并将各地区各个厂的商品揭去了商标，让营业员代表们辨认，由于许多名牌与非名牌的品质、花色等方面并没有什么差别，因而名牌与非名牌很难分辨。一个营业员代表说：原来名牌货并不都是好货，主要还是我们的“名牌”思想作怪。参观仓库时，营业员代表们看到大批积压的加工袜子，神经都很紧张。洪湖县代表说：“不看到这，看不到官僚主义害人害到这等程度！”随县代表说：“武汉加工的一百六十针单纱女袜，去年下半年本县就脱销，向上级要货却说没有，可怪，仓库里积压了三万四千多打！”营业员和商品见了面，一致讨论了为加工商品找销路的办法：（一）县与县、县与站、站与站之间内部交流，根据不同地区间群众需要，进行地区性的调剂；（二）合理调价；（三）改变花色，如白毛巾印染彩花，袜子改染颜色。（四）加强对消费者的宣传：以货比货、价比价、质量比质量，大力推销。同时营业员代表们还一致提出了“三变”保证——营业员变为宣传员，使滞销货变为热销货，非名牌变为名牌。
    营业员代表批判了不正确思想，并直接与商品见了面，研究了推销技术，同时重新审查了销售计划。根据群众需要与武汉批发站商品库存及货源情况，除了推销了十三万八千多打的加工袜子和一万八千打加工毛巾外，普遍修正了第二、三季度的销售计划。袜子各县平均二季度增加了百分之二八点五六，三季度增加了百分之三二点三六；毛巾二季度增加了百分之五点三，三季度增加了百分之一四点六九。如监利县原订计划销售袜子一万四千打，增加到一万六千打。在修正计划中，研究并分析了当地居民需要情况，为今后批发站组织货源提供了依据。    （靳吾）
