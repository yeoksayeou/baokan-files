	Fushun Electrical Engineering Tenth Factory Starts to Address Excessive Overtime Issues

	A letter from Li Feng, Deputy Director of the Fushun Electrical Engineering Tenth Factory: The People's Daily published a reader's letter on May 20 criticizing the excessive overtime at our factory. After we convened relevant personnel for inspection, we believe this criticism is basically correct. The main reasons for the excessive overtime in our factory in the past are: our leading cadres have serious bureaucratic work styles, which led to chaotic production management, extremely unreasonable material supply and labor organization, and insufficient coordination between various processes and departments. Instead of improving the above situation by strengthening production organization, planning, and improving business management, we relied on overtime to complete production tasks. Our practice of not complying with labor laws and neglecting the physical health of workers is a capitalist method of managing enterprises, which should not exist in state-owned enterprises.

	We accept the reader's criticism and have begun to overcome the phenomenon of excessive overtime. In May, except for a few units such as kiln firing, which could not be resolved temporarily due to technical problems, most units have basically solved the problem of excessive overtime. We plan to fundamentally solve this problem in June.

### 抚顺电工十厂着手解决加班加点过多问题

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    抚顺电工十厂着手解决加班加点过多问题
    抚顺电工十厂副厂长黎风来信：五月二十日人民日报登载了读者批评我厂有加班加点过多现象的来信。经我们召集有关人员进行检查，认为这一批评基本上是正确的。我厂过去加班加点过多的主要原因是：我们领导干部有严重的官僚主义作风，以致产生了生产管理混乱，材料供应、劳动组织极不合理，各工序及部门互相配合不够等现象；而我们不是从加强生产组织性、计划性和搞好经营管理着手改进以上情况，却依靠加班加点来完成生产任务。我们这种不遵守劳动法令、忽视工人身体健康的做法，是一种资本主义管理企业的方法，在国营企业里是不应该存在的。
    我们接受读者的批评，已着手克服加班加点过多的现象。五月份，除烧窑等少数单位因技术问题一时不能解决外，大部单位已基本解决了加班加点过多的问题；我们准备在六月份根本解决这个问题。
