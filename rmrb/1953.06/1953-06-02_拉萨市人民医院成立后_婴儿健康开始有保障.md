Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, May 31st: The health of infants in Lhasa has begun to be guaranteed. The Lhasa People's Hospital has set up bright, well-ventilated wards for expectant mothers, as well as relatively well-equipped nurseries, allowing women in labor to be hospitalized and give birth free of charge. People can often see Tibetan women recovering their health, smiling and holding red and chubby babies as they are discharged from the hospital and return home. Many pregnant women often go to the hospital for prenatal check-ups. Doctors and midwives in the hospital's obstetrics and gynecology and pediatrics departments often go to the homes of citizens to diagnose or deliver babies. Last winter and this spring, they put out the influenza and measles epidemics in the Lhasa area, vaccinated all children in the city against smallpox, and saved the lives of many infants and mothers. In February of this year, a Tibetan woman named Hua De had a difficult labor because the fetus was in a transverse position, and the child could not be born for several days. Her whole family was so anxious that they shed tears. The midwife of the Lhasa People's Hospital took her to the hospital, and after the operation, the child was born safely. The Tibetan family was so happy that they sent a silk banner to the Lhasa People's Hospital to express their gratitude. The health of the children has brought joy to many families. Parents will never forget Chairman Mao's kindness, saying that the children were saved by Chairman Mao, and using names such as "Happy Daughter" for their children. In the past, the infant mortality rate in Tibet was very high. Many couples who had given birth to more than a dozen children were still childless in their old age, so there was a sad saying: "It is better not to raise children than to give birth to them but not be able to keep them alive." Since the peaceful liberation of Tibet, this situation has begun to change.

    拉萨市人民医院成立后
    婴儿健康开始有保障
    【新华社拉萨三十一日电】拉萨市婴儿的健康已开始有了保障。拉萨市人民医院为临产的母亲们设立了光线充足、空气流通的病房，还有设备比较完善的婴儿室，让产妇们免费住院生产，人们经常可以看到恢复健康的藏族妇女，笑容满面地抱着又红又胖的孩子出院回家；许多孕妇时常到医院作产前检查。医院里妇产科、小儿科的医生和助产士们，经常到市民家中诊治或接生。去年冬天和今年春天，他们扑灭了拉萨地区的流行性感冒和麻疹，给全市儿童种了牛痘，并挽救了许多婴儿和产妇的生命。今年二月间，一个名叫花德的藏族妇女，因为胎儿横位形成难产，好几天孩子还生不下来，全家人急得流泪。拉萨市人民医院的助产士把她接到医院里，施行手术后孩子就平安地生下来了。这个藏族家庭欢喜得给拉萨市人民医院送了一面锦旗，表示感激。孩子的健康，给许多家庭里带来了欢乐。家长们忘不了毛主席的恩情，说是毛主席救下的孩子，并以“幸福的女儿”等作为孩子的名字。过去西藏地区婴儿的死亡率很大，许多生过十几个孩子的夫妇，到老年还是无儿无女，所以流传着：“生儿养不活，不如不养儿”的悲痛谚语。西藏和平解放以后，这种情况已有了初步改变。
