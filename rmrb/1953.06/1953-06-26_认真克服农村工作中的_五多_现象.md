    Recently, the Party committees in various regions have been successively inspecting the "five excesses" phenomenon in rural work, namely, excessive tasks, excessive meetings and training, excessive official documents and forms, excessive organizations, and excessive concurrent posts for cadres. Everyone recognizes that the existence of these phenomena has placed an excessive burden on rural cadres and the peasant masses, to some extent harming the production enthusiasm of the peasant masses, and causing many unnecessary difficulties for district and township cadres in their work; if this phenomenon is not seriously overcome, it will seriously hinder rural work and affect the country's economic construction. In order to overcome this phenomenon, the North China Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China conducted in-depth investigation and research, implemented several improvement measures, and achieved certain results. It proves that the "five excesses" phenomenon can be completely overcome.
    There is no doubt that the various rural policies stipulated by our Party are correct. The implementation of these policies has provided the broad masses of peasants with practical and fundamental benefits, and therefore it has been supported by the broad masses of peasants. This is undoubtedly the basic and main situation of today's rural work. The "five excesses" phenomenon is a countercurrent that plays a disturbing role in the normal progress of various tasks. There are many reasons for this phenomenon, among which the main one is that some leading organs stipulate too many tasks and make excessive and impatient demands. For example, in Yuci County, Shanxi Province, from November last year to January this year, a total of 21 relatively large tasks involving the majority of farmers were assigned within three months. In Yanshan County, Hebei Province, 18 tasks were assigned simultaneously at a township cadre meeting in one district, many of which were issued in parallel and had deadlines for completion. This inevitably led to an increase in meetings, reports, training, concurrent posts, etc., "rising with the tide." Therefore, solving the problem of excessive tasks and excessive and impatient demands should become the central link in overcoming the "five excesses" phenomenon.
    Why is there a phenomenon of excessive tasks and excessive and impatient demands in rural work?
    This is primarily due to the serious subjectivist work style of many leading cadres. When deciding on tasks, they often proceed solely from subjective wishes, regardless of objective conditions, wanting to accomplish many good things in one morning. Many comrades have also developed a sense of pride due to victory, fostering a careless attitude. They think they can do everything, casually, not caring about anything, as if everything can be done well with just an order. What is particularly serious is the neglect of the current state and characteristics of the small peasant economy, making many inappropriate demands on peasants, and excessively interfering with peasants; but little consideration is given to whether the masses can accept it and whether the conditions are in place. For example, in the agricultural production mutual aid and cooperation movement, some comrades only demanded to increase the percentage of collectivization, blindly pursued advanced forms of collectivization, violated the policy of gradually and controlled development of agricultural production cooperatives, and sought quantity, size, and speed, excessively and rapidly accumulating public property. As a result, it aroused the suspicion and dissatisfaction of peasants, hindering the progress of the mutual aid and cooperation movement. This subjectivist work style reflects the petty-bourgeois impatience and impractical style, and violates the principle of seeking truth from facts and doing things according to needs and possibilities repeatedly instructed by Chairman Mao.
    The bureaucratic work style and decentralist tendencies existing in leading organs above the county level are another important reason for the "five excesses" phenomenon. Some responsible cadres in leading organs do not understand the situation below, do not inspect work, do not seriously study policies, and relax ideological and political leadership, simply being satisfied with holding meetings, signing documents, and creating forms. This bureaucratic work style will inevitably lead to a phenomenon of detachment between leadership and reality. Decentralism is manifested on the one hand in the fact that the work of various levels and departments violates the principle of centralized unity, excessively emphasizing vertical leadership, arbitrarily assigning tasks downward, convening meetings, indiscriminately issuing official documents and forms, disrupting the central tasks and the state's unified construction guidelines, plans, and steps, making the lower levels feel that "everyone is a superior, everything is the center," busy, passive, and at a loss. On the other hand, it is also manifested in the fact that Party organizations at all levels relax unified leadership, fail to unify control and arrange various tasks, and fail to take necessary measures to oppose decentralist phenomena from all sides, and therefore cannot effectively prevent the occurrence of chaotic phenomena below. The harm of decentralism lies in the fact that it allows some unrealistic work tasks to proceed unimpeded, while many necessary and indispensable work tasks are either squeezed out because they cannot be arranged according to priority, or become a burden on the masses and cause dissatisfaction.
    It can be seen that the central link in solving the problem of excessive tasks and excessive and impatient demands is to oppose subjectivism in leadership thinking, and to control various work tasks from top to bottom, improve leadership style and leadership methods, and overcome bureaucracy and decentralism in leading organs. Party committees at all levels must re-examine various work tasks and improve leadership methods. Agricultural production is the overriding central task in rural areas, and everything else should revolve around agricultural production. The indicators and plans for agricultural production growth must be re-examined. All original plans and indicators that are too high should be realistically reduced, and plans that are appropriate should be retained, but they must all be carried out in accordance with the needs and voluntary principles of the peasants, and peasants must not be forced to implement them. Some other tasks should be stopped (such as rural insurance) or postponed, and some should have their plans re-examined. In short, all work should adhere to the principle of "steady progress" and act according to capacity. Anything that is needed and possible must be resolutely done; if it is needed but the conditions are not in place, conditions should be created first, and then it should be done; if it is needed but cannot be done at all at present, it should not be done; even if it can be done, there should be steps, and it cannot be universally promoted all at once.
    When we resolutely overcome the "five excesses" phenomenon, we must carefully and meticulously analyze various situations. What tasks are completely necessary and indispensable, what are excessive, what should be completely eliminated, and what should have their methods changed, must be clarified one by one; we must not adopt an attitude of negating everything, and we must not go from one extreme to another. At present, some areas have formed a situation of being tied up and lacking in leadership over work, abandoning necessary and feasible economic and political work for peasants in order to correct the "five excesses" phenomenon. This tailism tendency is obviously also completely wrong. We must lead peasants to actively develop production, and we must lead peasants to gradually embark on the road of collectivization, and we cannot fantasize about the "laissez-faire" advocated by some feudal rulers. All necessary and feasible economic work (such as production cooperation and supply and marketing cooperation, agricultural loans, fertilizer supply, water conservancy projects, the improvement of agricultural technology and farm tools, and the struggle against water and drought disasters and pests and diseases) and political work (such as the development and rectification of the Party and the Communist Youth League, the Party's propaganda and education work, the election of grassroots governments, national education, necessary rural health work, and the screening of films and slides in rural areas) should not be ignored and should not be abandoned. In some rural areas, these tasks are not excessive, but rather insufficient. The question is whether the methods of carrying out these tasks are suitable for the living conditions and level of awareness of the peasants. Comrade Stalin taught us in the article "Dizzy with Success": "The art of leadership is a serious matter... Whoever is willing to lead the movement, while also willing to maintain his connection with millions of people, should fight on two fronts: both against those who lag behind and against those who run too far ahead." Our overcoming the "five excesses" phenomenon is to further strengthen rural work, so that rural work will move forward more vigorously after overcoming certain mistakes, and not to stop the work that should be done in rural areas, or to deliberately do less of the work that should and can be done more. This negative view and practice and those who do not work seriously should be criticized.
    To oppose bureaucracy and decentralism, in addition to conducting strict ideological checks based on the principles of the Party and combined with reality, Party committees and people's governments at all levels should make overall arrangements for the work of the whole year, and should also make unified deployments for the work of each period, which should not only have a clear center, but also take care of the necessary regular work of various departments, because these regular tasks are indispensable parts of the entire work of the Party and state organs, and without the cooperation of these tasks, the central work will also suffer serious losses. All levels and departments must strictly implement the system of requesting instructions and reporting after the event in accordance with the principle of unified leadership. All major and important guidelines, policies, plans and major matters must be requested for instructions in advance and reported after the event. When implementing the instructions of higher authorities, it is necessary to analyze the characteristics of the work in the region and make specific arrangements, which must not only clearly explain the tasks, but also clearly explain the work style and work methods, and must not mechanically copy and apply them. For the decisions and instructions of higher authorities that are not suitable for the situation in the region, constructive opinions should be actively put forward, and they should not be pushed down with a stiff upper lip. Actively putting forward opinions and obeying leadership should not be opposed, and being responsible to subordinates and being responsible to superiors should not be opposed. After the tasks are assigned, it is also necessary to organize and purposefully conduct inspections, especially the main responsible cadres should personally go deep into the countryside, factories, mines, schools and various grassroots business units to understand the situation, review resolutions, explain policies, and summarize experience, which can not only effectively help the work below, but also enrich the experience of leading organs. The phenomenon of red tape in leading organs must be eliminated, and the organization and staffing should be adjusted and streamlined. Our principle is "rather less, but better." This "better" includes both quality and necessity. An unnecessary institution is not good to set up.
    At present, the political level and leadership experience of rural work cadres are not very commensurate with the tasks of the work, which is related to the large number of cadres promoted in recent years and the lack of systematic training; the situation of many senior leading cadres with low theoretical levels also exists. From the perspective of the whole Party, we have huge theoretical wealth, but a considerable number of cadres lack the necessary theoretical cultivation, and in the face of heavy and complex tasks, they are often incompetent and waver from side to side. Therefore, strengthening the training of cadres in service, improving them in terms of theoretical and policy level and cultural level, and strengthening the study of Marxist-Leninist theory by senior cadres, especially the theory and policies related to economic construction, in order to improve thinking and improve work, is an extremely important political task before us.
    The existence of the "five excesses" phenomenon undoubtedly reflects the mistakes and shortcomings in our work; overcoming these mistakes and shortcomings will of course encounter many difficulties. But this difficulty is the difficulty in the development of our cause, the difficulty in progress, and it is by no means an incurable disease. The masses' criticism of the "five excesses" phenomenon as "turning good things into bad things" is extremely pertinent. This shows that the masses trust our Party and understand that our Party's policies have always been to do good things for the masses, but it is only because some comrades do not know how to do things, or do them too hastily, or do them in the wrong way, that the masses have opinions and criticisms of us. Our responsibility lies in not concealing our mistakes and shortcomings, and in revealing and resolutely correcting these shortcomings and mistakes completely in accordance with the interests of the Party, the state, and the masses. If we do this, we will be invincible.

### 认真克服农村工作中的“五多”现象

    认真克服农村工作中的“五多”现象
    近来各地党委对于农村工作中的任务多、会议集训多、公文表册多、组织多、干部兼职多等“五多”现象，陆续做了检查。大家认识到这些现象的存在，给了农村干部和农民群众以过重的负担，在一定程度上损害了农民群众的生产积极性，并使区乡干部在工作中遭遇到很多不应有的困难；若不认真克服这种现象，就将严重妨碍农村的工作，影响国家的经济建设事业。为了克服这种现象，中共中央华北局做了深入的调查研究，实行了若干改进的办法，有了一定成效。它证明“五多”现象是完全可以克服的。
    我们的党所规定的各项农村政策无疑是正确的。这些政策的实施，使广大的农民群众获得了实际的和根本的利益，因而它受到广大农民群众的拥护。这些无疑地是今天农村工作的基本的和主要的情况。而“五多”现象则是一种逆流，它对各项工作的正常进行，起了一种纷扰的作用。产生这种现象的原因很多，其中主要的是某些领导机关规定任务过多，要求过高过急。如山西榆次县从去年十一月到今年一月份三个月内，布置了较大的涉及多数农民的任务有二十一项。河北省盐山县一区在一次乡干部会议上同时布置了十八项工作，这些工作许多都是平列下达，限期完成。这就不能不使得会议、表报、训练、兼职等也“水涨船高”，随着增多起来。因而解决任务过多、要求过高过急的问题，应成为克服“五多”现象的中心环节。
    为什么在农村工作中会有任务过多、要求过高过急的现象发生呢？
    这首先是由于不少领导干部有严重的主观主义的思想作风。他们决定任务时往往只从主观愿望出发，不顾客观条件，想把许多好事在一个早晨办完。有不少同志更因胜利而产生一种骄傲情绪，发展着一种漫不经心的态度。自以为什么都能干，随随便便，什么都不在乎，仿佛只要一声令下，一切就可办好。特别表现得严重的是忽视当前小农经济的现状和特点，向农民提出许多不适当的要求，过多地干涉农民；而对于群众能否接受，条件是否具备，却很少考虑。例如在农业生产互助合作运动中，有些同志，一味要求提高合作化的百分比，盲目追求合作化的高级形式，违反了渐进地有控制地发展农业生产合作社的方针，而贪多、求大、图快，过多过快地积累公共财产等。结果招来农民的怀疑和不满，反而阻碍了互助合作运动的前进。这种主观主义的思想作风，反映了小资产阶级的急躁和不切实际的作风，违背了毛主席一再指示的实事求是、根据需要和可能办事的原则。
    县以上各级领导机关中存在的官僚主义作风和分散主义倾向，也是引起“五多”现象的另一个重要原因。有些领导机关中的负责干部，不了解下情，不检查工作，不认真研究政策，放松思想政治领导，简单地以召集会议、签署文件、制造表格等为满足。这种官僚主义作风，势必发生领导和实际脱节的现象。分散主义一方面表现在各级各部门的工作违背集中统一的原则，过分强调垂直领导，各自为政地硬性地向下分派任务，召集会议，滥发公文表册，搞乱中心任务和国家统一的建设方针、计划和步骤，使下边感到“人人是上级，事事是中心”，忙乱被动，无所适从。另一方面还表现在各级党的组织放松统一领导，不去统一控制和安排各项任务，不采取必要的措施反对来自各方面的分散主义现象，因而就不能有效地阻止下边混乱现象的发生。分散主义之为害，就在于它使得有些不切实际的工作任务得以通行无阻，而许多必要的不可少的工作任务却因为不能按照轻重缓急加以安排，或则被挤掉，或则变成为群众的负担而招致不满。
    由此可见，解决任务过多、要求过高过急问题的中心环节是反对领导思想上的主观主义，并自上而下地控制各种工作任务，改善领导作风和领导方法，克服领导机关中的官僚主义和分散主义。各级党委必须重新审查各种工作任务并改善领导方法。农业生产为农村压倒一切的中心任务，其他一切都应围绕着农业生产来进行。对于农业生产增长的指标和计划必须重新审订。凡原计划原指标过高的应实事求是地加以降低，计划适宜的则予以保留，但又都必须按照农民的需要和自愿原则进行，不得强迫农民执行。其他工作有的应停止进行（如农村保险）或推迟进行，有些应重新审查计划。总之，一切工作要掌握“稳步前进”的原则，量力而行。凡属需要而又可能的，必须坚决去办；虽然需要而条件不具备的，应先创造条件，然后再办；虽然需要而目前根本办不到的，不要举办；可能办的，也要有个步骤，不能不管什么都一下子普遍推广。
    在我们坚决克服“五多”现象时，对各种情况必须加以认真和仔细的分析。究竟那些任务是完全必需的，不可缺少的，那些是多了，那些应根本取消，那些则应改变作法，必须一一弄清楚；不可采取否定一切的态度，不可从一个极端走到另一个极端。目前某些地区，为了纠正“五多”现象而形成束手束脚，放松对工作的领导，放弃对农民进行必要而可行的经济工作和政治工作，这种尾巴主义倾向显然也是完全错误的。我们要领导农民积极发展生产，并且要领导农民逐步走上集体化的道路，就不能幻想像有些封建统治者所标榜的“无为而治”。凡属一切必要而可行的经济工作（例如生产合作和供销合作，农业贷款，肥料供应，水利事业，农业技术和农具的改进，对水旱灾和病虫害的斗争）和政治工作（例如党和青年团的发展和整顿，党的宣传教育工作，基层政权的选举，国民教育，农村必要的卫生工作，电影幻灯在农村的放映工作）都是不应该忽视，不允许放弃的。这些工作在有些农村还不是过多，而是过少。问题是在进行这些工作的方法是否适合农民的生活条件和觉悟程度。斯大林同志在“胜利冲昏头脑”一文中教导我们：“领导的艺术是一件严重事情。……谁愿意领导运动，同时又愿意保持自己和千百万群众的联系，那他就应进行两条战线上的斗争：既反对落在后面的分子，又反对跑得太前的分子。”我们克服“五多”现象，是为了进一步加强农村工作，使农村工作在克服某些错误以后更加生气勃勃地前进，而不是要把农村应该做的工作也停顿下来，把应该和可能做得多一点的工作也故意做得少一点。这种消极的看法和作法以及不认真工作的人都应该受到批判。
    要反对官僚主义和分散主义，除了根据党的原则并结合实际从思想上进行严格检查以外，各级党委和人民政府应对全年工作做总的安排，对每一时期的工作也要做统一的部署，既要有明确的中心，又应照顾各部门的必要的经常工作，因为这些经常工作都是党和国家机关的整个工作的不可缺少的部分，没有了这些工作的配合，中心工作也就要受到严重的损失。各级各部门必须按照统一领导的原则，严格执行请示报告制度，一切主要的和重要的方针、政策、计划和重大事项，必须事先请示，事后报告。在执行上级指示时，必须分析本地区工作的特点，作具体的布置，既要交代清楚任务，又要交代清楚工作作风和工作方法，不可机械地照抄照搬。对于不适合本区情况的上级决定和指示，应积极提出建设性的意见，不可硬着头皮往下推。积极提出意见和服从领导不应是对立的，对下负责和对上负责更不应是对立的。在布置任务之后，还必须有组织有目的地进行检查，特别是主要负责干部要亲自深入农村、厂矿、学校和各种基层业务单位，了解情况，审查决议，讲明政策，总结经验，既可以有效地帮助了下边的工作，又可以充实领导机关的经验。领导机关的文牍主义现象必须肃清，机构和人员配备应加以调整和精简。我们的原则是“宁肯少些，但要好些”。这个“好”，既包括质量，也包括必要性，不必要的机构设起来就是不好的。
    目前农村工作干部的政治水平和领导经验同工作的任务不很相称，这和几年来干部的大量提拔而缺少系统的训练的情况有关；不少高级领导干部，理论水平不高的情况也是存在的。从全党来讲，我们拥有巨大的理论财富，但为数相当多的干部，却缺乏必要的理论修养，在繁重复杂的任务面前，常常力不胜任，左右摇摆。因此，加强对于在职干部的训练工作，从理论、政策水平和文化水平各方面提高他们，加强高级干部的马克思列宁主义理论，特别是有关经济建设的理论和政策的学习，以提高思想，改进工作，是摆在我们面前的一项极其重要的政治任务。
       “五多”现象的存在，毫无疑问是反映了我们工作中的错误和缺点；克服这些错误和缺点，当然会遇到很多困难。但是这种困难是我们事业发展中的困难，是前进中的困难，决不是不可医治的病症。群众批评“五多”现象是“把好事办成坏事”，这是极中肯的。这表明群众相信我们的党，了解我们党的政策从来都是给群众办好事的，只是因为有些同志不会办事，或者办得过急了一些，或者办的方法不对，所以群众才有意见，才对我们提出批评。我们的责任就在于毫不掩盖我们的错误和缺点，完全按照党的、国家的和群众的利益，来揭发并坚决改正这些缺点和错误。我们做到了这一点，我们便会无往而不胜利。
