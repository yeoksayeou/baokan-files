Xinhua News Agency, June 27th: According to TASS, the working people in both urban and rural areas of the Soviet Union are holding rallies to celebrate the issuance of the 1953 national bonds and are enthusiastically subscribing to the new bonds. In Moscow, many factories have held celebrations. At a rally at the Moscow Cable Factory, roller operator Smirnov said: "Our national bonds contribute to the consolidation of the Soviet state power and the improvement of the lives of all nationalities. One day, I visited the National Moscow University on Lenin Hills—the best palace of science in the world. I couldn't help but stare at it. I know that this is where the funds from our national bond subscriptions are being used! I am wholeheartedly willing to use my two weeks' salary to purchase national bonds." At a grand rally held by residents of Leningrad, attendees expressed their joy and excitement. Many people, while expressing their active subscription to national bonds, cited the changes in their city, district, or factory to illustrate the fatherly care of the Soviet government for the people's welfare. An old worker from the Kirov Electrical Engineering Equipment Factory in Leningrad, Porobunikov, said at a workers' meeting, "We can see this great change with our own eyes on every street and in the workshops of our own factory. This year, about two hundred families in our factory will hold housewarming banquets in their new homes." All the workers at the construction site of the Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Station on the Volga River subscribed to the national bonds. Advanced worker Yermolenko, after signing the subscription form, said: "The Soviet state is doing a lot to reduce workers' labor. In the construction of our power station, we can use various types of powerful excavators, dredgers, and so on. Thanks to this huge technical equipment, our working conditions have been greatly improved. In a short period of time, we can excavate more than five million cubic meters of soil from the foundation pit."

The famous foreman of the Bukhta Ilyicha coastal oilfield, A. Kurbanov, spoke on behalf of all Azerbaijani oil workers at the Baku celebration of the national bond issuance. He emphasized that our government does not use huge sums of money for the arms race and war preparations. Our government is developing peaceful industries and building schools and hospitals. This is the reason for our economic development and the continuous improvement of the lives of the Soviet people.

Collective farmers and Soviet intellectuals in various places have also held rallies to celebrate the issuance of national bonds. At the celebration meeting of the Presidium of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, famous scientists talked about the rapid development of the Soviet economy and the prosperity of Soviet science and culture. Countless collective farmers enthusiastically expressed their subscription to national bonds at the celebration meetings and talked about the Soviet government's care for the people's welfare. In the Ukrainian Republic on the banks of the Trubezh River, Stalin Collective Farm member Yulchinko said at the farm's meeting: "The life of Soviet farmers is getting better and better. Take our farm as an example, we have a middle school where our children can study for free. We have a rural hospital where we can get free medical care. In the evening, farmers can listen to the radio and watch TV programs. Last year, the farm's income was 2.65 million rubles, and this year it will increase to 3.4 million rubles." At the meeting of the "Thirtieth Anniversary of Kazakhstan" Collective Farm in Almaty Oblast, Kazakh Republic, female member Suleimanova enthusiastically said after describing the excellent machines used on the collective farm's land: "In order to make the life of the Soviet people even better, each of us has decided to lend our savings to the government."

    苏联城乡劳动人民热烈认购新公债
    【新华社二十七日讯】据塔斯社消息：苏联城乡各地劳动人民纷纷举行集会，庆祝一九五三年公债的发行，并热烈认购新公债。在莫斯科，许多工厂都举行了庆祝会。在莫斯科电缆工厂的集会上，辗压机操使者斯米尔诺夫说：我们的公债有助于苏维埃国家力量的巩固和各族人民生活的提高。有一天，我到列宁山上参观了国立莫斯科大学——世界上最好的科学之宫。我忍不住目不转睛地看着它。我知道，这就是使用我们认购的公债款项的地方！我衷心情愿地准备把我两个星期的工资购买公债。在列宁格勒居民举行的盛大集会上，到会者表达了他们欢欣鼓舞的心情。许多人在表示积极认购公债时举出自己城市、市区或工厂的改变，来说明苏维埃政府对于人民生活福利的父亲般的关怀。列宁格勒基洛夫电力电工器材厂的老工人波罗布尼科夫在工人大会上说，我们可以在每条街上，在我们自己工厂的车间中亲眼看到这种巨大的变化。今年，我厂工人在自己的新住宅内举行新屋落成宴会的就有两百户左右。伏尔加河畔古比雪夫水电站施工现场上的全体工人都认购了公债。先进工人叶尔莫连科在认购单上签了名之后说：苏维埃国家正在做许多减轻工人劳动的工作。在建设我们电力站的时候，我们可以使用各种类型的强大掘凿机、吸泥机等等。由于这种巨大的技术设备，我们的劳动条件大大改善了。在短短一个时期内我们就能从基坑中掘出五百多万立方公尺的泥土。
    布克塔·伊尔伊查海滨油田的著名领班阿·库尔巴诺夫，在巴库庆祝公债发行的大会上代表阿塞拜疆全体石油工人讲话。他强调说，我们的政府不是把巨额款项用在扩张军备运动和战争准备上面。我们政府正在发展和平工业、兴建学校和医院。这就是我们经济发展和苏维埃人民生活不断提高的原因。
    各地集体农民和苏维埃知识分子也纷纷集会庆祝公债的发行。在苏联科学院主席团的庆祝大会上，著名的科学家谈述了苏联经济的迅速发展和苏联科学和文化繁荣的情况。无数集体农民在庆祝会上踊跃表示认购公债，并谈到了苏维埃政府对人民生活福利的关怀。在乌克兰共和国特鲁贝日河畔，斯大林集体农庄庄员尤尔钦科在农庄的大会上说：苏联农民的生活越来越美好了。拿我们农庄来说吧，我们有一个中等学校，我们的子女可在里面免费求学。我们有一个农村医院，我们可以在里面得到免费医疗。一到傍晚农民还可以听收音机，看电视节目。去年，农庄的收入有二百六十五万卢布，今年还将增加到三百四十万卢布。在哈萨克共和国阿拉木图州“哈萨克的三十年”集体农庄的大会上，女庄员苏列曼诺娃在描述了该集体农庄土地上所使用的优良机器后热情地说：为了使苏维埃人民的生活更加美好，我们每个人都决定把我们的积蓄借给政府。
