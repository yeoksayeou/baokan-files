    On the Front Lines of National Economic Construction
    Making the Capital More Beautiful
    The first and second batches of road construction projects and key park construction projects in Beijing this year have commenced successively.
    Beijing’s urban construction plan for this year, in addition to concentrating efforts on building and expanding several important road arteries, will also universally improve the original gravel roads in urban and suburban areas and some of the dirt roads in the hutongs. This year, a total of more than 210 kilometers of roads will be constructed, with 100 kilometers newly built and more than 110 kilometers of road surface improved. There are a total of 61 new roads. This includes the new 11-kilometer trunk line from Xizhimen to the Summer Palace. In terms of road maintenance and improvement projects, the dirt roads of more than 120 hutongs will also undergo asphalt surface treatment and dust prevention treatment. In addition, the uneven gravel road from Shijingshan to Mentougou will be converted into an asphalt road this year. This is a great joy for the steelworkers of Shijingshan and the miners of the Western Hills mining area.
    In addition, this year it is planned to plant more than 50,000 trees along both sides of the dozens of new roads to be built in the urban and suburban areas, with a total length of 50 kilometers. Parks and green spaces of more than 600 mu will be built in Taoranting, Longtan and other places. In Zizhuyuan in the cultural and educational area, in conjunction with the project of converting paddy fields into lakes, more than 7,000 flowers and trees will also be planted. Trees will also be planted and lawns laid in some remote areas of the city.
    More than 120 kinds of flowers and trees propagated from nurseries this year, such as Sophora japonica, snow-white and dark purple lilacs, pink Prunus triloba, light yellow Forsythia, as well as roses and Cotinus coggygria, are now being carefully cultivated by gardeners, ready to adorn the streets of the capital.
    Harbin City Construction Project Begins
    Harbin’s urban construction projects are commencing one after another.
    Harbin’s municipal construction investment this year has increased by 30 percent compared with last year. All the project plans this time are determined based on the principle of "serving urban industrial development and serving the lives of the working people." Kangzhuang Bridge, one of the main construction projects this year, is a transportation hub between Xiangfang (industrial area) and other areas. Soon, various vehicles will be speeding on this wide bridge, creating convenient transportation conditions for the development of Xiangfang. This year, 115,000 square meters of roads will be built and rebuilt in the industrial and cultural areas, including the construction of an asphalt road of 23,000 square meters in front of the Harbin Flax Factory. In order to solve the problems of factory drainage, citizen transportation, water use, and gas use in the industrial area, 3,100 meters of new drainage trunk lines, 4 kilometers of tram lines, 5,000 meters of water risers, and 2,000 meters of gas pipelines will also be built in the Xiangfang area. In order to improve environmental sanitation, the sewage ditch on An Guang Street will also be converted into a culvert. In terms of urban greening, it is planned to plant 24,500 trees and cultivate 5 million seedlings in the city.
    After the preparatory work in the first quarter, the first phase of Harbin's municipal construction projects, including eight projects such as the An Guang Street sewer, the Dongzhizhi Road and 18th Road water supply, the Banlachengzi Brick Factory Road, the city road repair, the Huangshan Zui Brick Factory wooden bridge, and tree planting, have started successively. People participating in urban construction are working hard to build their city more prosperous and beautiful with joy and excitement.
    Drilling the Agan Town Coalfield in Gansu
    The Northwest Coal Mining Administration dispatched the Second Drilling Team to the Agan Town mining area in Gansu to carry out drilling work.
    The underground resources of the Agan Town mining area have been a mystery for hundreds of years. How much coal reserves are there? What is the distribution of the coalfield? No one knows. This time, the Second Drilling Team dispatched by the Northwest Coal Mining Administration came here to drill, and it is expected that by July next year, the drilling task of the entire mining area can be completed to determine the coalfield distribution and coal reserves of this mining area, so as to carry out planned mining.
    At present, this drilling team has set up tents in the mine and started intensive preparations. The first drilling tower has begun to be built.
    Xinjiang People Actively Build the Aksu Old Bridge
    Under the leadership of the local people's government, workers and farmers from Aksu, Wensu, Awat, and Ushi counties in Aksu Prefecture, Xinjiang, actively built the Aksu Old Bridge. At present, the bridge project has been successfully completed and opened to traffic.
    The Aksu Old Bridge is one of the important bridges on the Aksu-Kashgar highway. In February this year, seven of the twelve columns in the third row under the bridge were broken by the water, affecting the traffic between Aksu and Kashgar. The Aksu Prefecture Flood Control and Bridge Construction Committee actively transferred a group of cadres and technicians and mobilized more than 30,000 workers and farmers from Aksu, Wensu, Awat, and Ushi counties to participate in the bridge repair work.
    Due to the continuous increase in everyone's labor enthusiasm, three new river embankments, 300 meters long, 3 meters wide, and 4 meters high, were built in addition to the plan. This project was successfully completed and opened to traffic on March 30. (Wang Haifeng)
    Northern Shanxi Builds a Temporary Reservoir on the Hun River
    The northern part of Shanxi Province suffers drought in nine out of ten years. Although the Sanggan River and Hun River run through it, the water volume is very small during the dry season in summer, which is not enough for use, resulting in large areas of land suffering from poor harvests year after year. In order to reduce the threat of drought to the local people, the Jinbei Sanggan River Water Conservancy Bureau began constructing a temporary reservoir at the head of the Hun River canal on April 16. Thanks to the enthusiastic support of the local government and the masses, the entire project was completed by May 12 and has now begun to store water. This reservoir can store 2.5 million cubic meters of water, which can irrigate more than 19,000 mu of farmland. (Liang Shikui, Lang Kuangrong, Wu Kaizhi)
    Zunhua Baimayu Village Masses Protect Springs and Divert Water to Turn Terraces into Paddy Fields
    Baimayu Village in Zunhua County, Hebei Province, is a mountain village surrounded by mountains. Most of it is terraced fields, which become dry a few days after rain. Even when the rainfall is even, only 60% of the harvest can be expected. With the help of the higher-level party committee, the Baimayu Village Branch of the Communist Party of China studied and inspected the village's natural environment and found that the small springs in the Dayu and Shuiyu gullies were washed away by mountain floods every year in the past, and could only irrigate more than 40 mu of land. There was still great potential to be tapped. The branch decided to mobilize the masses to build slow-flow dams to block sand and protect the springs. But at the beginning, the masses had concerns and were not very interested in protecting the springs and diverting water. Gao Yong, the secretary of the branch, and Gao Yuman, a member of the branch committee, used the facts of more grain being produced by watering the land to conduct comparative education. For example, Gao Xueming's five mu of non-irrigated terraced fields in the village produced only one stone of wheat and one stone and seven dou of millet per year. Gao Jinhong's two mu of irrigated terraced fields produced an average of three stones of grain per mu. After all the farmers in the village recognized the benefits of turning dry land into paddy fields, the land users who used the springs freely combined and contracted out the work. As of the end of April, a total of three large slow-flow dams, eight chi wide, one zhang to two zhang long, and one zhang and two chi high, had been built. Two water ditches, more than three li long and more than two li long, were repaired. Now the spring water is flowing gurglingly along the water ditches. Of the 1,380 mu of terraced fields in the village, 370 mu have been freed from the threat of drought, and thousands of fruit trees have been irrigated. The branch also plans to continue to dig springs and divert water to expand the irrigation area.

    在祖国经济建设的战线上
    把首都建设得更美丽
    北京市今年第一、二批修建道路工程，和重点兴建园林的工程，已经陆续开工。
    北京市今年的城市建设计划，除集中力量新建和扩建几条重要的道路干线外，还普遍改善城区、郊区的原来的石碴路和部分胡同的土路。今年要修建总长达二百一十多公里的道路，新建的有一百公里；路面改善的有一百一十多公里。新建的道路一共有六十一条。其中包括自西直门到颐和园长达十一公里的新干线。道路养护改善工程方面，也将要把一百二十多条胡同的土路，进行土路沥青表面处理和防尘处理。此外，石景山到门头沟凹凸不平的石碴路，也将在今年改建成沥青路。这是石景山钢铁工人和京西矿区工人们的一件大喜事。
    另外，今年计划要在城郊各区新修建的几十条道路两边，栽植五万多棵、总长五十公里的行道树。要在陶然亭、龙潭等地，建设六百多亩的公园和绿地。在文教区的紫竹院，配合把水田改建成湖泊的工程，也要种植七千多株花木。城区的一些偏僻的地方，也将栽植树木和铺上草坪。
    今年从苗圃繁殖出来的一百二十多样的花木，如杨槐、雪白和深紫的丁香花、红粉的榆叶梅、淡黄色的迎春花、以及玫瑰、黄栌树等，现在正被养花工人们尽心地培养，准备用这些花木点缀首都街头。哈尔滨城市建设工程开工
    哈尔滨市城市建设工程正陆续开工。
    哈尔滨市今年的市政建设投资较去年增加百分之三十。这次所有的工程计划都是根据“为城市工业发展和为劳动人民生活服务”的原则确定的。今年建设的主要工程之一康庄桥，就是香坊（工业区）和其他地区之间的交通枢纽。不久，将有各种车辆奔驰在这条宽阔的大桥上，为香坊的发展创造便利的交通条件。今年，在工业区和文化区将修建和改建道路十一万五千平方公尺，其中包括在哈尔滨亚麻厂门前修建一条长达二万三千平方公尺的柏油马路。为了解决工业区工厂排水及市民交通、用水、用瓦斯等问题，在香坊地区还要新建排水干线三千一百公尺、电车线路四公里、水吊管五千公尺、瓦斯管线两千公尺。为改善环境卫生，还要将安广街的污水沟改为暗渠。在城市绿化方面，计划在市内植树二万四千五百棵，育苗五百万棵。
    哈尔滨市市政建设工程经过第一季度的准备工作，第一期开工的安广街下水道、东直路及十八道街上水道、半拉城子砖厂道路、市内道路补修、黄山嘴子砖厂木桥以及植树等八项工程，已于日前先后开工。参加城市工程建设的人们，都怀着欢欣和鼓舞的心情，要努力把自己的城市建筑得更繁荣更美丽。钻探甘肃阿干镇煤田
    西北煤矿管理局派了第二钻探区队，到甘肃阿干镇矿区，进行钻探工作。
    阿干镇矿区的地下资源，几百年来一直是个谜，究竟煤藏量有多少？煤田分布的情况怎样？谁都不知道。这次西北煤矿管理局派出的第二钻探区队到这里来钻探，预计明年七月，可以完成全矿区的钻探任务，确定这个矿区的煤田分布情况和煤的蕴藏量，以便有计划地进行开采。
    目前这支钻探队已在矿山里搭起了帐篷，开始了紧张的准备工作。第一座钻塔已在着手建立。新疆人民积极兴修阿克苏老大桥
    新疆阿克苏专区的阿克苏、温宿、阿瓦提、乌什四县的工人、农民在当地人民政府的带动下，积极兴修阿克苏老大桥，目前该桥工程已顺利完工通车。
    阿克苏老大桥是阿克苏到喀什公路上的重要桥梁之一。今年二月，该桥下边第三排十二根立柱，被水冲断了七根，影响到阿克苏到喀什间的交通。阿克苏专区防洪建桥委员会积极抽调一批干部和技术人员，发动阿克苏、温宿、阿瓦提和乌什四县的工人、农民共三万余人参加了修桥工作。
    由于大家劳动热情不断高涨，在计划之外还新筑了三条长三百公尺，宽三公尺，高四公尺的河堤。三月三十日这项工程胜利完工并已通车。（王海峰）
    山西北部修建浑河临时蓄水库
    山西北部地区十年九旱，虽有桑乾河、浑河贯串其中，但在夏季枯水期中水量甚微，不够使用，因而大片土地连年歉收。晋北桑乾河水利管理局为了减除旱灾对当地人民的威胁，从四月十六日开始在浑河渠首修建一座临时蓄水库。由于当地政府和群众的热烈支持，到五月十二日便完成了全部工程，现已开始蓄水。这个水库能蓄水二百五十万立方公尺，可灌田一万九千多亩。（梁世魁、郎宽容、吴楷之）
    遵化白马峪村群众护泉引水变梯田为水田
    河北省遵化县白马峪村是一个群山环抱的山庄，大部分是梯田，下过雨不几天就干旱，雨水调匀时也只有六成年景。中共白马峪村支部在上级党委帮助下，研究并检查了村里的自然环境，发现原有大峪、水峪两个山沟的小水泉，过去每年被山水冲没，只能浇四十多亩地，还有很大的潜在力可以利用。支部便决定发动群众打缓水坝，挡住砂石，保护泉眼。但开始时群众有顾虑，对护泉引水工作兴趣不大，支部书记高永和支委高玉满便用水浇地多打粮的事实进行对比教育，如该村高学明五亩不浇水的梯田，每年种二亩麦子打一石多，三亩谷子打一石七斗多。高进红二亩水浇梯田平均每亩都合三石粮食。在全村农民都认清了旱田变水田的好处后，便由使用水泉的地户自由结合，分工包活。到四月下旬为止，共打成了三道八尺宽、一丈到两丈长、一丈二尺高的大缓水坝。修了两条三里多长的，一条二里多长的水沟。现在泉水顺着水沟哗哗地流着，全村一千三百八十亩梯田，已有三百七十亩免除干旱威胁，几千棵果树都得到了灌溉。支部还计划继续凿泉引水，扩大灌溉面积。
