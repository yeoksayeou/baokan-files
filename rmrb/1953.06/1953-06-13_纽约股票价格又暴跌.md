    Xinhua News Agency, New York, 12th dispatch: On June 9th, stock prices on the New York Stock Exchange plummeted again, reaching what American news agencies called the highest peak of "nervous agitation" caused by the prospect of a Korean armistice.
    According to various news agency reports, the price drop on June 9th reduced the value of listed stocks on the exchange by approximately $2.5 billion. The total volume of stock sold reached 2.2 million shares. Of the 1,234 stocks traded, 1,009 declined in price. The average stock price fell to its lowest level since last October.
    Many companies' stocks fell by more than two or three dollars per share, with "Amerada Petroleum Corporation" stock even falling by more than seven and a half dollars. Railroad stocks fell by an average of three and a half dollars per share, which, according to United Press, was the worst market for railroad stocks since 1946. Companies whose stocks declined included General Motors, Chrysler, Bethlehem Steel, General Electric, utility stocks, American Telephone & Telegraph, DuPont, International Petroleum Corporation, Southern Railway Company, and New Jersey Zinc Company, among others.
