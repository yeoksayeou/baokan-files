Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, June 27th: The Syngman Rhee clique's actions, under the direction of certain warmongers in the United States, to undermine the realization of the armistice, have met with fierce opposition from the South Korean people who yearn for peace. Newly captured Rhee's puppet soldiers have stated that the South Korean people, under Syngman Rhee's cruel rule, are longing for an immediate end to the Korean War. Two captured soldiers from the 27th Regiment of the Rhee puppet 5th Division had seen, before their capture in Chuncheon, the "anti-armistice" parades that the Syngman Rhee gang forced citizens to participate in. One soldier said: Although there were many plainclothes police monitoring the front, rear, left, and right of the parade, most of the people forced to participate were holding the small flags they were given upside down. The Syngman Rhee special agents leading the parade were shouting slogans, but although their mouths were moving, it was almost impossible to hear what they were shouting. The women forced to participate deliberately twisted the babies on their backs to make them cry loudly, using this method to express their resistance to Syngman Rhee.

The South Korean people are endlessly enduring the profound suffering brought to them by the aggressive war waged by the American aggressors and the Syngman Rhee gang. Now, almost all the young men in South Korea have been conscripted into the army. A Rhee puppet sergeant said: In May of this year, 70 percent of the new recruits drafted from Gwangju County, Gyeonggi Province, were staff members from government agencies. Due to the exorbitant taxes and levies of the Syngman Rhee regime, the lives of the South Korean people are on the verge of collapse. In South Chungcheong Province, people are generally eating gruel made from tree bark. A teacher at Jeonju Industrial High School in North Jeolla Province, unable to maintain his livelihood, committed suicide with his entire family of six by taking poison.

    李承晚阻挠停战的破坏行动受到南朝鲜人民的激烈反对
    【新华社朝鲜前线二十七日电】李承晚集团在美国某些好战分子指使下破坏停战实现的行动，受到渴望停战的南朝鲜人民的激烈反对。新近被我军俘掳的李伪军士兵说：在李承晚残酷统治下的南朝鲜人民都渴望马上停止朝鲜战争。李伪军第五师二十七联队两个被俘士兵在被俘前曾在春川看到过李承晚匪帮强迫市民举行的“反对停战”游行。一个士兵说：尽管当时游行行列的前后左右有许多便衣警察监视着，但被强迫参加游行的人大部分都倒拿着发给他们的小旗。走在游行行列前面的李承晚特务领着他们喊口号，他们的嘴巴虽然咕哝着，但几乎听不清他们喊些什么，而被迫参加游行的妇女们却故意把背着的小孩扭得哇哇直哭，他们用这种办法来表示对李承晚的反抗。
    南朝鲜人民无止境地经受着美国侵略者和李承晚匪帮进行侵略战争带给他们深重的苦难。现在，南朝鲜的青年几乎全被抓去当了兵。一个李伪军中士说：今年五月，京畿道广州郡征去的一批新兵中已有百分之七十是政府机关中的工作人员。由于李承晚政权的横征暴敛，南朝鲜人民生活已濒绝境。在忠清南道，人民普遍吃树皮做的糊糊。全罗北道全州工业中学的一个教员，由于无法维持生活，全家六口人服毒而死。
