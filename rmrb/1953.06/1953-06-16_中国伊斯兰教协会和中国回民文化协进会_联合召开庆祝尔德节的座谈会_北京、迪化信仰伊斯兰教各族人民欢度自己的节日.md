Xinhua News Agency, June 15th -- The China Islamic Association and the China Hui Culture Advancement Association jointly held a symposium on the 15th to celebrate Eid al-Adha. Participants included Ma Yu-huai and Da Pura-sheng, deputy directors of the China Islamic Association; Bai Shou-yi and Ma Song-ting, deputy directors of the China Hui Culture Advancement Association; and more than 40 members of the China Islamic Association and the China Hui Culture Advancement Association in Beijing, as well as imams from various mosques in Beijing.

The meeting took the form of informal talks, with each person sharing their thoughts on celebrating Eid al-Adha. In their speeches, Ma Yu-huai, Da Pura-sheng, Ma Song-ting, and others unanimously pointed out that this year, as people of all ethnic groups who believe in Islam celebrate their festival, the establishment of the China Islamic Association is particularly exciting. Ma Yu-huai said: Without the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, it would be impossible to organize Chinese Islam, which includes ten ethnic groups and many denominations, into a unified national organization. The imams of various mosques in Beijing all felt that the grand scale of this year's Eid al-Adha was unprecedented. Guan Hua-ting, the imam of the Niujie Mosque, said: We should thank the People's Government. In the years since liberation, the People's Government has helped people of all ethnic groups who believe in Islam to improve their lives, which has enabled us to celebrate our festival to our heart's content. In many people's speeches, they also expressed that they should make even greater efforts in the future to carry out the various tasks stipulated by the China Islamic Association.

Xinhua News Agency, June 14th -- The 14th was Eid al-Adha (the Festival of Fast-Breaking) in Islam, and people of all ethnic groups in the capital who believe in Islam celebrated their festival. The grand festival prayer service was held at the Dongsi Pailou Mosque, which has a history of 510 years. Attending the service were Aaisa, deputy director of the General Office of the Nationalities Affairs Commission of the Central People's Government; Ma Yu-huai, deputy director of the China Islamic Association; Ma Teng-ai, deputy director of the China Hui Culture Advancement Association; and more than 1,000 Islamic believers from various organs, schools, factories, enterprises, and residents in Beijing.

More than 30 young people of various ethnic groups who believe in Islam, including Hui, Uyghur, Tatar, Kazakh, Dongxiang, and Salar, who are attending the Second National Congress of the All-China Youth Federation, also participated in the prayer service.

Roza, the Pakistani ambassador to China, also attended the prayer service.

Before the prayer service began, An Shi-wei, the imam of the Dongsi Pailou Mosque, spoke. He said: Today, so many people of all ethnic groups who believe in Islam are celebrating Eid al-Adha together, which is something that has never happened in our mosque before; this is entirely the result of the People's Government's firm implementation of the policy of freedom of religious belief and ethnic equality and unity. We, the people of all ethnic groups who believe in Islam, should better unite around the People's Government and build our great motherland.

After the religious ceremony was completed, the people of all ethnic groups who participated in the prayer service held a group greeting. They shook hands and exchanged greetings, celebrating the festival.

Today, more than 60 mosques in Beijing also held prayer services at the same time.

In accordance with the religious policy of the Central People's Government and in order to respect the customs and habits of minority ethnic groups, employees who believe in Islam in various organs, organizations, factories, and schools in Beijing were given a day off today.

According to Xinhua News Agency: The people of all ethnic groups in Dihua who believe in Islam joyfully celebrated "Eid al-Fitr" on the 14th. Citizens and cadres of various ethnic groups, including Uyghur, Hui, Kazakh, Kyrgyz, Uzbek, Tatar, and Tajik, in Dihua City held festival prayers in 46 mosques. Gao Jinchun, vice chairman of the Xinjiang Provincial People's Government, Rao Zhengxi, mayor of Dihua City, Tao Zhiyue, deputy commander of the Xinjiang Military Region, and Zeng Di, deputy director of the Political Department, all visited the home of Burhan, director of the China Islamic Association and chairman of the Xinjiang Provincial People's Government, and Saifuddin, vice chairman of the Xinjiang Provincial People's Government, to offer their festive greetings.
