	Between the Danube River and the Black Sea, in the southeastern corner of Romania, stretches a yellow, treeless prairie and bare, rocky mountains. There is no water source there, and the few swamps that exist quickly dry up under the summer sun. In winter, harsh winds sweep across the land. In summer, waves of dry, hot winds completely destroy the plants that grow in spring.

	This was the past situation of the Dobruja region of Romania. But today, it has completely changed, making it hard to believe that it used to be an arid land. Now it has become a site of intense and fervent work. The Romanian government has decided to build a Danube-Black Sea Canal here. This great project has brought a new look to Dobruja: modern new cities are being established to replace those dilapidated and crude villages; factories and workshops are springing up everywhere, some of which have already started operations; and beautiful houses are emerging one after another.

	When the first builders came to Dobruja, these people bearing a glorious mission came here for the first time to survey the land and build temporary housing, the local farmers still showed them skeptical eyes, doubting whether this great project to transform nature could become a reality. But now you can no longer find anyone more enthusiastic about the canal construction than the farmers of Dobruja. To support this great project, thousands of farmers from the villages of Dobruja, and even from distant parts of the country, have rushed to participate in the work.

	Construction is proceeding day and night. At night, the dazzling searchlights and the strong lights of excavators, self-loading trucks, and other machines are intertwined, illuminating the area as if it were daytime. The roar of excavators and the howls of machines carrying large stones merge into one. Work is accelerating, and in the first quarter of 1953, many advanced work teams exceeded their plans, some reaching 136 percent of their original targets.

	In the drawings of the canal construction site made by artists in the early stages of the project, scenes of manual earthmoving were still depicted. But now, the mechanization of construction has reached nearly 90 percent of the total work. All construction sites are full of working giants—excavators, dredgers, drills, bulldozers, and so on. The newly arrived state-of-the-art Soviet giant floating crane can lift 50 tons. There is a strange Soviet machine used to excavate the riverbed called a "water cannon." This machine uses water to shoot at the bottom of the sandy layer, causing large amounts of sand to collapse, turning into mud, and flowing into a small ditch next to it, from which it is discharged to a distance through pipes. Such a "water cannon" can wash away 600 cubic meters of sand per day.

	The canal construction site has now become a giant school for workers, technicians, and engineers. Since the campaign to improve the professional skills of staff was launched in August 1949, more than 8,000 technical cadres have been trained on the construction site. Many have become skilled excavator operators, truck drivers, electricians, tractor drivers, and bulldozer operators.

	Of course, all achievements are inseparable from the assistance of the Soviet Union. Only with the strong help of the Soviet Union can the various difficult problems that arise in such a huge construction project be solved. Whether in building cities, opening up roads, constructing railways, building port facilities, establishing factories, or transforming nature, the construction personnel have received Soviet assistance. Four-fifths of the machines used on the construction site are supplied by the Soviet Union.

	Under the leadership of the Romanian Workers' Party, the canal builders are striving to learn advanced Soviet working methods and have launched the Stakhanovite movement. Many workers have now become Stakhanovite workers and advanced workers. Ironworker Ian Filaru of the First Port Group, excavator operator Qi Usum of the Twelfth Group of Novodari, assistant mechanic Puligesge, and hundreds of other workers are all advanced workers who have emerged during the project.

	If people were to take a trip along the course of the future canal, it would be very interesting. The starting point of the canal is Cernavodă. In the past, the port here was small and old, only capable of berthing barges and small boats. Apart from the bridge across the Danube, there was nothing else worth mentioning in this town. The bridge is the longest and oldest in Romania. In the past, Romanian gentlemen would always pass over this bridge on their way to the Black Sea spa resorts, and they would always praise the bridge endlessly. Now, the people enjoying the seaside resorts are completely different. When people pass through Cernavodă, the bridge no longer attracts them as much as the new scenery displayed by the port—the canal bed, and the first wharf of the new port that is already in use, adjacent to the old docks. Excavators are working day and night there, digging the future reservoir.

	Midiaca is the center point of the canal. The closer you get to here, the more intense and larger the canal construction becomes. Here, the riverbed paving project is being completed. The network of irrigation canals drawn from both sides of the main canal will supply water to the vegetable gardens and orchards that are about to appear on what was once a barren land. In the past three years, tens of thousands of saplings have been planted here—windbreaks to protect the canal and the young orchards from the ravages of the Dobruja dry winds.

	The canal will divide Midiaca into two parts: each side will be larger than the old city. As workers from all over the country converge here, the population of Midiaca has almost doubled. It will become the processing center for agricultural products, grapes, fruits, and livestock products in this emerging prosperous region.

	On the other side of Midiaca, the canal turns northwest from the railway line. Along both banks of the river are vegetable gardens, orchards, rice paddies, and lush windbreaks. A dense network of roads—many of which are asphalt roads—has traversed the countryside. No matter which way you look, new residential areas attract your attention; the largest of these is the town of Poarta Albă, which is under construction. The former desert has left no trace.

	A few kilometers away from Poarta Albă, the ground suddenly changes, and the canal directly approaches the rocky Ganari Mountains. There, builders must pass through the mountains to open up the waterway. Dozens of huge excavating machines loaded on trains and trucks are working here. Cranes grab huge stones; these stones will be used as building materials for ports and dams.

	Looking down towards Navodari, you can see the first power plant of the canal. When this power plant was built, the electricity demand of the construction site was less than a quarter of its power generation capacity. But in the near future, the electricity demand of the construction project alone will far exceed its power generation. Of course, all this was foreseen, so a second power plant—a thermal power plant with a greater power generation capacity than the first—was built near the first power plant. The second power plant is now in operation, and it is supplying electricity to the construction site and the cities and villages of Dobruja. Electricity has greatly accelerated the progress of the construction project.

	Finally, you arrive at the port of Midia on the Black Sea coast, which is the end of the canal. Huge stones excavated from the Ganari Mountains are unloaded from trains and will be used as the foundation stones for building breakwaters. In the future, the breakwaters will extend far into the sea.

	When the Danube-Black Sea Canal, which is about sixty kilometers long, opens to navigation in 1955, the distance from the Danube port of Cernavodă to the Black Sea will be reduced by four-fifths compared to the original. The face of the Dobruja region will be completely changed: new cities and ports will emerge along with the canal construction, and the Midia seaport will be much larger than the old port of Constanța on the Black Sea coast; the huge machinery manufacturing plants, building materials factories, and other factories built in the canal area will constitute the core of Dobruja's future industry; the planting of 15,000 hectares of forest belts will protect the arable land from the ravages of torrents and dry winds; and 100,000 hectares of land will be irrigated.

	Transforming nature with labor and turning deserts into fertile fields—this is the magnificent work that the Romanian people are carrying out today under the leadership of the Workers' Party. Inspired by the brilliant example of the great communist construction projects in the Soviet Union, the hardworking and brave Romanian people are intensifying their work to make the Danube-Black Sea Canal open to navigation as soon as possible.

    多瑙河与黑海之间
    在罗马尼亚东南角的多瑙河和黑海之间，延展着一片黄色的无树的草原和光秃秃的石头山。那儿没有水源，仅有的一些沼泽，在夏季的烈日下，也很快地干涸了。冬天，严寒的疾风横扫大地。夏天，阵阵来袭的干旱的热风，就把在春季生长出来的植物完全毁掉。
    这就是罗马尼亚的多布鲁查州过去的情况。但是，今天这里已经完全变了样，几乎使人很难相信它过去是一片干枯的土地。现在这里已成为紧张热烈的工作场所了。罗马尼亚政府决定在这里建筑一条多瑙河—黑海运河。这个伟大的工程，给多布鲁查带来了新兴景象：现代化的新城市正在建立起来，去代替那些破烂的简陋的乡村；工厂和工场到处崛起，其中有些已经开工；漂亮的住宅，正一幢幢出现。
    当第一批建筑者们来到多布鲁查，这些担负着光荣任务的人们第一次来到这里勘察地面，搭造临时住宅的时候，当地的农民对他们还显露出怀疑的眼光，怀疑这个改造自然的伟大工程计划能够变成现实。但现在你却再也找不到比多布鲁查农民对运河建设更热心的人了。为了支援这个伟大的工程，成千的农民从多布鲁查州的乡村，甚至从国内遥远的地方赶来参加工作。
    建筑工程昼夜不停地进行着。入夜，耀眼的探照灯和掘土机、自动装卸运货车以及其他机器的强烈的照明灯的光芒交织在一起，照耀如同白昼。掘土机的喧嚣声和载运大石块的机器的吼叫声混成一片。工作正在加速进展，一九五三年第一季度的计划，许多先进的工作队都超额完成了，有的达到了原定任务的百分之一百三十六。
    艺术家们在工程初期描绘运河工地的图画里，还画着人工运土的情景。而现在，建筑工程的机械化程度已经达到全部工作的近百分之九十了。所有的建筑工地上，满是工作的巨人——掘土机、挖泥机、钻孔机、开路机等等。新运到的最新式的苏联巨型水上起重机可以举重五十吨。有一种用来开凿河床的奇怪的苏联机器叫做“水炮”，这种机器用水来向沙层的底部射击，大量的沙土就崩塌下来，变成泥浆，汇流到旁边的一道小沟中，再由管子把它排送到远处去。这样的一个“水炮”，一天能冲走六百立方公尺的沙土。
    现在运河的建筑工地已成为一个工人、技师和工程师们的巨大学校了。自从一九四九年八月开展了提高工作人员业务水平的运动以来，已在工地培养出了八千多名技术干部。许多人都已成为熟练的掘土机手，汽车驾驶员，电气工人，拖拉机手，开路机驾驶员了。
    当然，一切成就都是和苏联的援助不可分的。只是在苏联的大力帮助之下，如此巨大的建筑工程中所发生的各种困难问题才可能获得解决。无论在建设城市，开辟公路，建筑铁道，建设港口设备，建立工厂，改造自然等等方面，建筑人员都得到苏联的援助。工地上所使用的机器，有五分之四是由苏联供给的。
    在罗马尼亚工人党的领导之下，运河的建筑工人们努力学习苏联先进的工作方法并展开了斯大哈诺夫运动。许多工人现在已成为斯大哈诺夫式工作者和先进工人了。第一港口组的铁工伊盎·菲拉鲁，诺沃达里第十二组的掘土机手奇·乌苏姆，助理机械师蒲立格斯哥以及其他好几百工人都是在工程进行中涌现出来的先进工作者。
    如果人们沿着未来的运河河道作一次旅行的话，那一定是很有趣的。运河的起点是黑水镇。在从前，这里的港口是狭小而陈旧的，只不过能停泊些驳船和小舟而已。除了那座横跨多瑙河的大桥以外，这个小镇上便再也没有什么别的东西值得提起了。那桥是罗马尼亚国内最长和最古老的一座。从前，罗马尼亚的绅士们在去黑海矿泉浴场避暑的途中，总是要经过这座桥，并且总要对这座桥赞赏不止。现在享用海滨浴场的已是些完全不同的人们了。当人们途经黑水镇的时候，大桥对他们的吸引力已远不及港口所展现着的新的景象——运河河床，以及与旧码头相比邻的、已在使用的新港的第一个码头。掘土机昼夜不停地在那里挖掘着未来的蓄水库。
    米奇迪亚是运河的中心点，愈接近这里，运河的建筑工程也进行得愈加紧张，规模愈大。这里河床的敷设工程正在完成着。由运河干流两旁引出的灌溉渠网，将供水给行将出现在从前是一片不毛之地上的菜园和果园。过去三年中，已在这里栽种了几万株树苗——保障运河和年青的果园免受多布鲁查旱风蹂躏的防风林带。
    运河将把米奇迪亚划分为两个部分：每一边都比旧城要大。由于工人们从国内各地向这里汇集，米奇迪亚的人口几已增加了一倍。它将成为这一新兴的繁荣地区的农产品、葡萄、水果和畜产的加工中心。
    在米奇迪亚的那一边，运河由铁路线转向西北方奔流。沿河两岸都是菜园、果园、稻田和葱郁的防风林带。稠密的公路网——其中许多是沥青路——已横贯乡间。无论你朝那一边看去，都有新的住宅区吸引你的视线；其中最大的是正在建筑中的波尔他·阿巴镇。以前的荒漠一点也不留痕迹了。
    离波尔他·阿巴几公里远的地方，地面突然变了，运河直逼岩石的加纳里山。那里，建筑者们必须穿过山岩，开通河道。装在火车和卡车上的几十架巨大的掘凿机，正在这里工作着。起重机攫起巨大的石块；这些石头将用作港口和堤坝的建筑材料。
    朝着诺沃达里向下望去，能看到运河的第一个发电厂。当这所发电厂建立的时候，工地的电力的需要量还不及它发电能量的四分之一。但不久的将来，光是建筑工程电力的需用量就远远超过了它的发电量。当然，这一切都是预见到的，于是在靠近第
    一座发电厂的地方，又造了第二座发电厂——一座发电量大于第一座电厂的火力发电厂。第二个发电厂现在已开工了，它正输电给建筑工地和多布鲁查的城市和乡村。电力大大加速了建筑工程的进行。
    最后，来到了黑海沿岸的港口米迪亚，这是运河的终点。巨大的从加纳里山开凿来的石块，从火车上卸下来，它们将用来作为叠造防波堤的基石。将来，防波堤将远远地伸向海中。
    当全长约六十公里的多瑙河—黑海运河在一九五五年通航以后，从多瑙河的港口黑水镇到黑海的距离，将比原来缩短五分之四。多布鲁查州的面貌将要完全改变：新的城市和港口将随着河道建筑工程而出现，其中的米迪亚海港将比黑海沿岸的旧港康斯坦萨要大得多；在运河区建筑起来的巨大的机械制造厂、建筑器材工厂和其他工厂，将构成多布鲁查未来工业的核心；一万五千公顷的森林带的种植，将保障耕地免受激流和旱风的袭击；十万公顷的土地面积将获得灌溉。
    用劳动来改造自然，把荒漠变为良田，这就是罗马尼亚人民今天在工人党的领导下所进行的宏伟的工作。在苏联伟大共产主义建设工程的光辉范例的鼓舞之下，勤劳勇敢的罗马尼亚人民正在加紧工作，使多瑙河—黑海运河早日通航。  （周坚操编译）（附图片）
