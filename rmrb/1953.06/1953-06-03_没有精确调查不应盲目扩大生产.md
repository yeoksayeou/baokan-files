Do Not Blindly Expand Production Without Accurate Investigation
Du Daozheng, Fang Ling

In the three months from November last year to January this year, the Ci Shan Iron Mine experienced chaos due to blindly increasing workers and blindly expanding production. As a result, 258 workers were injured, and 10.2 billion yuan of capital was wasted and stockpiled. Although this situation has been initially reversed, it has given us a very painful lesson.

The Ci Shan Iron Mine is an isolated mountain protruding 200 meters above the ground, and the mountain is full of ore with an iron content of up to about 60%. The Ci Shan Iron Mine is a local state-owned enterprise engaged in open-pit mining by hand, and is under the leadership of the Hebei Provincial People's Government's Industry Department.

The Ci Shan Iron Mine officially started mining in July 1951, and the situation was good. One reason was that it was mining the ore face left by the Japanese, with little soil and good ore quality. For example, the second mining area has a mining face 100 meters wide and 70 meters high, all of which is good ore. Only 0.3 tons of soil needs to be removed from the mining face to mine one ton of ore. The second reason was that the workers were all old workers who had worked in this mine in the past, had technology, and were active, so the mining efficiency was high, there were few accidents, and the cost was low. Until October last year, the average daily mining volume per worker was always around one ton, and the cost per ton was always around 40,000 yuan. The selling price of each ton of ore was as high as 121,000 yuan and as low as 116,000 yuan, and the profit was very high. At that time, the capital turnover of the Ci Shan Mine averaged 34 days.

The leading cadres of the Ci Shan Iron Mine were overwhelmed by this smooth situation and its achievements. Leading cadres of the Industry Department of the Hebei Provincial People's Government and other relevant responsible cadres were also infected with the same emotions. They were only satisfied with the achievement of each worker mining an average of one ton per day for the past year, but did not know in detail under what conditions this average mining rate was obtained. As a result, they came to the wrong conclusion and subjectively thought that adding workers would increase ore mining, and that adding a certain number of workers would mine a certain amount of ore. However, they did not give enough consideration to how large the Ci Shan mining face was, whether it could accommodate so many people, and what changes might occur in the ore quality.

On November 1st last year, the leading cadres of the Ci Shan Mine, based roughly on the above-mentioned erroneous calculation method, signed a contract with Anshan Iron and Steel Company in Northeast China, guaranteeing to sell 700,000 tons of ore to the other party in 1953. When signing the contract, the leading cadres of the Ci Shan Mine realized that supplying such a huge amount of ore to Anshan Iron and Steel was a task with serious political significance, and felt that they were not very confident. However, they were encouraged by a responsible cadre of the Central People's Government's Ministry of Heavy Industry at that time, and signed the contract with political enthusiasm.

The central, North China, and Hebei Province all supported the Ci Shan Iron Mine with great efforts, giving people when needed, giving money when needed, and giving machines when needed. The leading cadres of the Ci Shan Mine and the Provincial Industry Department still believed that as long as more workers were added, the mining task could be completed. At that time, the Ci Shan Mine's request for additional workers was as urgent as a fire. From the end of November to the beginning of December last year, the Provincial Industry Department transferred people from 18 factories and mines to Ci Shan, and also allowed the Ci Shan Mine to recruit workers locally. The total of these two items added up to 4,000 to 5,000 people.

However, the development of the facts was contrary to the subjective wishes of these comrades. The Ci Shan mining face could not accommodate so many workers at all, and production was instead disrupted. At this time, a sulfur belt was discovered in the mining face, and the good mining face was greatly reduced. The amount of soil turned over for each ton of ore increased from 0.3 tons to 2 tons, which further strengthened the density and chaos of people on the mining face. Old worker Pang Migui said about this situation: "The mining face is crowded with people, like peasants going to a temple fair, how can there be production! This is clearly taking the state's money and throwing it away here!" He said that at that time, the people who were drilling blasting holes would hit people if they raised the sledgehammer even slightly off-center, and when ore fell from the top of the mountain, people were so crowded that they couldn't avoid it. At that time, accidents occurred on the mining face every day, and workers were carried down injured every day. Pang Migui said: "Many new workers had no intention of producing, and old workers wanted to produce, but were crowded and unable to produce." Therefore, there was a sharp increase in the number of workers in the Ci Shan Iron Mine, and there was also a sharp decrease in production. In October and before, each worker mined an average of about one ton of ore per day, but in December it dropped to 0.272 tons, and in January of this year it dropped to 0.203 tons. The cost per ton of ore increased from more than 48,000 yuan in October to 101,000 yuan in December, and to 130,000 yuan in January of this year. The number of people injured in accidents at the Ci Shan Mine each month increased from 30 in October to 104 in December.

This put the leading cadres of the mine in a passive and chaotic situation. Cai Zhijie, Secretary of the CPC Ci Shan Mine Committee, said: "In those days, my heart would beat whenever the phone rang, thinking that there was another accident, and all my energy was put into dealing with personal accidents." The sudden increase of thousands of new workers also made housing and food a big problem, and the leading cadres had to get entangled in daily affairs, which further aggravated the passivity of the leading cadres and the chaotic situation of the mine.

The chaos at the Ci Shan Iron Mine was stopped after reducing the number of workers and lowering the mining figures. This happened in January. After accepting the lessons of failure, the leading cadres of the mine, the Industry Department of the Hebei Provincial People's Government, and relevant superiors realized this, and immediately laid off 3,278 workers, and cut the 1953 mining plan figure in half. In addition, corresponding measures were taken to adjust the labor organization and strengthen security work. With the production workers reduced by about half, the mining face production gradually returned to normal. The average daily mining volume per worker stopped declining, increasing from 0.203 tons in January to 0.333 tons in February, and the cost per ton fell from 130,000 yuan to 100,000 yuan. The number of injured workers fell from 80 in January to 8. Production continued to improve in March and April.

Since last winter, all the preparatory work of the Ci Shan Mine has been based on the number of workers participating in production and striving to complete the huge ore figures supplied to Anshan Iron and Steel. Now that the number of workers and mining figures have been reduced by half, all the materials originally prepared will naturally be stockpiled by half. From the steel plates transferred from Chongqing City to the willow hats worn by the workers, everything is stockpiled. The money spent on laying off workers and the depreciated value of stockpiled materials throughout the mine amounted to 10.2 billion yuan.

The Ci Shan Iron Mine did not conduct accurate investigations, blindly increased workers, and blindly expanded production, causing serious losses to the state. Although this situation has been reversed, its lessons of failure should be remembered by all regions.

    没有精确调查不应盲目扩大生产
    杜导正  方凌
    去年十一月到今年一月的三个月中，磁山铁矿因盲目增加工人、盲目扩大生产，造成混乱现象。结果伤工人二百五十八人，浪费和积压资金一百零二亿元。现在这种情况虽然已经初步扭转，但它给我们的教训是十分沉痛的。
    磁山铁矿是一突出地面二百公尺的孤山，山中都是矿石，含铁量高达百分之六十左右。磁山铁矿是用手工露天开采，地方国营，受河北省人民政府工业厅领导。
    磁山铁矿于一九五一年七月正式开采，情况良好，一是因为采的是日本人遗留下的矿面，土少，矿质好。像第二采矿场，矿面宽一百公尺，高七十公尺，都是好矿石，采一吨矿石，只须从矿面上翻去零点三吨土就行了；二是因为工人都是过去在这矿上作过工的老工人，有技术，又积极，所以采矿效率高，事故少，成本低。直到去年十月份，每个工人每日平均采矿量始终是一吨左右，每吨成本都始终在四万元左右。每吨矿石售价高时为十二万一千元，低时十一万六千元，利润很高。当时磁山矿，资金平均三十四天周转一次。
    磁山铁矿的领导干部被这种顺利情况及其成就冲昏了头脑。河北省人民政府工业厅领导干部及其它一些有关负责干部也沾染了同样的情绪。他们只满足于一年来每个工人每日平均采矿一吨的成绩，但不详细知道这个平均采矿率是在什么条件下得到的。这样，他们得出错误的结论，主观地以为：添工人就能多采矿石，增加多少工人，就能采出多少矿石来。但磁山矿面究竟有多大，放不放下那么多人，矿质可能起那些变化，他们却考虑的很不够。
    去年十一月一日，磁山矿领导干部大体上根据上述的错误计算法，同东北鞍山钢铁公司签订了合同，保证一九五三年售给对方七十万吨矿石。签订合同时，磁山矿领导干部认识到供给鞍钢如此巨大数字的矿石，是一项含有严重政治意义的任务，觉得把握不很大，曾经表现犹豫过，但当时受到中央人民政府重工业部一个负责干部的鼓励，凭着政治热情就签字了。
    中央、华北、河北省各方面，用大力支持磁山铁矿，要人给人，要钱给钱，要机器给机器。磁山矿和省府工业厅的领导干部这时还认定只要工人添的多，采矿任务就能完成。当时磁山矿增拨工人的要求急如星火。去年十一月底十二月初，省工业厅从十八个厂矿抽人到磁山去，又允许磁山矿在当地招收工人。两项合计，就增加了四、五千人之多。
    可是，事实的发展和这些同志的主观愿望相反。磁山矿面上根本容不下这么多工人，生产反倒被扰乱了。此时，矿面发现硫磺带，好矿面大大缩小了，采每吨矿石的翻土量由零点三吨增到二吨，这更加强了矿面上人的密度与混乱程度。老工人庞米贵谈到这种情况时说：矿面上挤成人疙瘩了，像庄稼人赶庙会一样，怎能生产呢！这明明是拿上国家的钱到这儿白扔来啦！他说，当时凿炮眼的把铁锤子扬起得稍偏一点就碰着人，山头上矿石脱落下来时，人挤的躲都躲不开。那时，矿面上天天出事故，每天都有受伤的工人被抬下去。庞米贵说：许多新工人没心生产，老工人想生产，又被人挤的没法生产。因此，磁山铁矿工人来了个猛增加，生产也来了个猛下降。十月份及其以前，每个工人每日平均采矿石
    一吨左右，十二月降到零点二七二吨，今年一月降到零点二○三吨；每吨矿石成本却由十月份的四万八千余元，增到十二月份的十万一千元，今年一月份则增加到十三万元。磁山矿每月因事故受伤的人数则由十月份的三十人增到十二月份的一百零四人。
    这就使该矿的领导干部陷于被动与混乱中。中共磁山矿党委书记蔡志杰说：那些天，电话铃一响就心跳，以为又是出事故了，精力全放到应付人身事故上去了。突然增加的数千新工人，住房吃饭也成了大问题，领导干部不得不纠缠于日常事务，这更加重了领导干部的被动与矿上的混乱情况。
    磁山铁矿的混乱在减少工人、削低采矿数字后被制止了。这是一月份的事。该矿领导干部、河北省人民政府工业厅及有关上级接受失败教训后觉悟了，立刻遣散了三千二百七十八名工人，将一九五三年采矿计划数字削去一半。此外，又采取了其它调整劳动组织，加强保安工作等相应措施。生产工人减去一半左右，矿面生产即逐渐趋于正常。工人每天平均采矿量停止下降，一月份采零点二零三吨，二月份升至零点三三三吨，每吨成本由十三万元落至十万元；受伤的工人数由一月份的八十人落至八人。三、四月份生产继续好转。
    去冬以来，磁山矿一切准备工作，都是根据工人人数参加生产、为完成供给鞍钢的巨大矿石数字而努力的。现在把工人、采矿数字减去一半，原来准备的一切物资自然也要积压一半。上至重庆市调来的钢板，下至工人戴的柳帽都积压了。全矿遣散工人花的钱及积压物资折款达一百零二亿元。
    磁山铁矿不做精确调查，盲目增加工人，盲目扩大生产，给国家造成的损失是严重的。这种情况虽已扭转，但它的失败教训是各地应该记取的。
