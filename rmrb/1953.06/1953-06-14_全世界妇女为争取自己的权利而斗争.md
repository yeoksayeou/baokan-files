    Women Around the World Fight for Their Rights
    Soviet Union Jilie Fuskaya
    Since the establishment of the Women's International Democratic Federation in December 1945, the struggle of women for political, economic, and civil rights has become the main content of the international women's democratic movement. The Women's International Democratic Federation now unites 135 million women in 65 countries.
    In most countries of the world—in all capitalist, colonial, and dependent countries—women do not enjoy equal rights, or have no rights at all. In Switzerland, a bourgeois democratic country, women still do not have the right to vote today. In Iran, women similarly do not enjoy the right to vote. Even in those countries where equality between men and women is declared in the constitution, such equality does not exist in reality. For example, in the United States, state laws contain more than fifty different restrictions that deprive millions of American women of the possibility of exercising their right to vote. Although Italian women also have the right to be elected as judges according to law, not a single woman's name appeared on the list of candidates when judges were elected last year. In Spain, Portugal, many countries in Latin America, Syria, Lebanon, and other countries, the restrictions on women's suffrage are so extensive that they are virtually unable to participate in the country's political life.
    In no capitalist country do women enjoy equal economic rights with men. In most cases, they are engaged in unskilled, low-paying jobs. Women who do the same work as men are only paid 50 to 75 percent of their wages. In Italy, women earn 20 to 40 percent less than men for the same work, in West Germany—an average of 41 percent less, and in Austria—30 to 35 percent less. In the United States, women's average wages are only 40 percent of men's wages. In the event of production cuts, women are the first to be thrown into the streets and usually do not receive unemployment benefits. In many countries, women are fired once they get married. The Netherlands, for example, is one such country.
    In capitalist countries, only a small number of wealthy women can study in universities. For example, women account for just over 5 percent of British universities, 14 percent in Norway, and 16 percent in Belgium. But many of them, even after finishing university, still stay at home or work in fields unrelated to their studies. The situation for women in colonial countries to receive education is even worse. Illiteracy is the fate of most working women in these countries.
    Motherhood brings not joy but suffering to many women in capitalist countries. The lack of paid leave during pregnancy and childbirth, as well as the lack of free maternity hospitals, contributes to a huge mortality rate for mothers and infants.
    The expansion of armaments and war preparations is achieved by lowering the living standards of the broad masses of people. Rising prices and taxes, increasing poverty and hunger, all fall on the shoulders of women and their family members.
    The women of all countries, who have made great contributions to the cause of defeating fascism, cannot tolerate this oppressed situation. They are fighting for their rights, the happiness of their children, democratic freedoms, national independence, and against the threat of new wars.
    Women are using rallies, demonstrations, petitions, and delegations to demand that their governments grant them the same political, economic, and civil rights as men, not to dishonor the dignity of women, to care for the protection of motherhood and children, to reduce military budgets, and to increase allocations for housing, schools, and hospitals. They oppose the constant rise in prices and demand equal pay for equal work. In many countries, women actively assist striking workers and their families.
    Women in Western European countries are increasingly actively opposing the arms race policy, opposing dragging their countries into those aggressive plans; rising up to defend independence and democratic freedoms.
    Women in West Germany and Japan are fighting against turning their countries into offensive bases for new wars, and they are increasingly determined to demand the abolition of the occupation system, oppose enslaving separate treaties, and support the conclusion of genuine peace treaties in accordance with the Potsdam Agreement.
    Women in Latin American countries are waging an active struggle for independence and democratic freedoms. In these countries, a broad movement of mothers opposing sending their sons to Korea has been launched. As a result of the struggle of the entire people, Brazil did not send a single soldier to fight in Korea.
    More and more layers of oppressed women in colonial and dependent countries are being drawn into the struggle for their own rights and the national liberation movement for independence and freedom.
    Women in Korea, Vietnam, and Malaya, together with their husbands, sons, and brothers, are defending the freedom and independence of their countries. Whether in the rear, on the front lines, or in the guerrillas, they have shown the greatest example of tenacity, heroism, and confidence in victory. The struggle of the people of these countries for their liberation has won the full sympathy of all peace-loving humanity.
    Women in all countries are indignantly protesting the bloody war in Korea, and they are demanding the signing of an armistice agreement and an end to the Korean War. In Britain, the relatives of soldiers sent to Korea have launched a movement to fight for the return of their children and relatives home and for a ceasefire. In the United States, members of the American Women for Peace Committee sent letters, appeals, and telegrams to the government and the United Nations from mothers whose sons were in Korea, demanding an end to the Korean War.
    Women, under the banner of the Women's International Democratic Federation, are fighting for their rights and for peace. In the charter of the Women's International Democratic Federation, the struggle for women's rights is stipulated as the most important task. None of the congresses and meetings convened by the Executive Committee and Council of the Women's International Democratic Federation has failed to raise the issue of women's rights, and none has failed to take various measures to strengthen the struggle for these rights.
    In 1952, the International Conference for the Defense of Children was convened in accordance with the resolution of the Women's International Democratic Federation, and various issues concerning the protection of the rights of mothers were also raised. The reason why the Women's International Democratic Federation is waging a struggle is to make the government of every country not only declare but also guarantee the equal rights of women.
    The Women's International Democratic Federation was one of the initiators of convening the First World Peace Congress. Under the leadership of the Women's International Democratic Federation, women actively participate in the implementation of all the measures of the World Peace Council. For example, more than half of the signatures on the Peace Covenant were collected by women.
    In order to make women more active and united in the struggle for their rights and in the defense of peace, the Women's International Democratic Federation will convene the World Women's Congress in Copenhagen from June 5th to 11th of this year. The first item on the agenda of the Congress is: "The tasks of women in the struggle for and defense of women's rights as mothers, workers, and citizens."
    Preparations for this conference have been widely underway in more than eighty countries for a long time. It is being carried out under the slogan of upholding the resolutions of the Vienna World People's Peace Congress and establishing unified action in the struggle for the urgent interests of women.
    Women in the Soviet Union, China, and the People's Democratic countries are free and equal, and they play a huge role in establishing a new social system. The example of these countries encourages women in capitalist, colonial, and dependent countries to fight for their rights, for peace, and for the happiness of their children.
    Soviet women actively participate in the life of the state and society. Nearly 2,500 women have been elected as representatives to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union and the Supreme Soviets of the Union and Autonomous Republics, and more than 500,000 women have been elected as representatives to local Soviets. The following facts illustrate the role of Soviet women in communist construction: women account for about half of all those engaged in the national economy. The number of women experts with higher education exceeds 900,000. The number of women working in Soviet science, schools, and cultural and educational institutions exceeds 2.5 million. The number of women studying in national universities and secondary specialized schools exceeds 1.2 million. More than a million women are engaged in healthcare work, of which 220,000 are doctors, which is one hundred times higher than the number of female doctors in Tsarist Russia. Women lead enterprises, collective farms, and scientific research institutes. Women are selflessly laboring to complete and overfulfill the Soviet Union's Fifth Five-Year Plan, and many innovators in production, transportation, and agriculture have emerged from their ranks.
    The Soviet women's delegation's participation in this conference once again demonstrated the will of Soviet women and the entire Soviet people for peace, for strengthening friendship and cooperation with the people of all countries, and for expanding friendly ties with women of all countries.
    The World Women's Congress marks a new stage in the women's democratic movement. It will bring women more closely together in the struggle for their rights, for the happiness of children, for peace and national independence, and for the conclusion of a peace covenant among the five major powers.

    全世界妇女为争取自己的权利而斗争
    苏联  吉列芙斯卡雅
    自一九四五年十二月成立国际民主妇女联合会以来，妇女争取政治、经济和公民权利的斗争便成为国际妇女民主运动的主要内容。国际民主妇女联合会现在团结着六十五个国家里的一亿三千五百万妇女。
    在世界大多数国家里——在所有资本主义、殖民地和附属国家里，妇女都享受不到平等的权利或根本就没有权利。在瑞士这个资产阶级民主国家里，妇女直到今天也没有选举权。在伊朗，妇女同样享受不到投票权。就在那些宪法上宣布妇女平权的国家里，事实上这种平权也并不存在。例如在美国，各州的法律共有五十种以上不同的限制，这些限制剥夺了千百万美国妇女行使自己选举权的可能性。虽然意大利妇女根据法律也有被选为法官的权利，但是在去年选举法官时，候选人名单中却连一个妇女的名字也没有。在西班牙、萄葡牙，在拉丁美洲的许多国家，在叙利亚、黎巴嫩和其他国家，妇女选举权所受到的限制竟达到这种程度，以致使她们事实上不可能参加国家的政治生活。
    无论在任何一个资本主义国家里，妇女都享受不到与男子平等的经济权利。在大多数场合下，她们都是从事不熟练的，付钱很少的工作。妇女虽做与男子同样的劳动，也只获得他们工资的百分之五十到七十五。在意大利，妇女做与男子同样的劳动所得的工资，较男子少百分之二十到四十，在西德——平均少百分之四十一，在奥地利——少百分之三十到三十五。在美国，妇女平均工资只合到男子工资的百分之四十。在减少生产情况下，妇女首先被抛向街头，并且照例享受不到失业补助金。许多国家里，妇女一旦结婚便会遭到解雇。例如荷兰，就属于这类的国家。
    资本主义国家里，只有少数的富家妇女能够在高等学校读书。例如，在英国高等学校中，妇女仅占百分之五强，在挪威——百分之十四，在比利时——百分之十六。但是她们当中有许多人即使上完高等学校，也依旧闲在家里，不然就是用非所学地工作着。殖民地国家妇女接受教育的情形还要坏些。文盲是这些国家大多数劳动妇女的命运。
    母性给资本主义国家许多妇女带来的不是快乐而是痛苦。由于怀孕和分娩期间没有工资照付的休假，以及没有免费的产育院，便促成产妇和婴儿的巨大死亡率。
    扩军和备战，是靠降低广大人民群众的生活水平来实现的。物价和捐税的增长，日益增加的贫困和饥饿，都落在妇女和她们家庭成员的肩上。
    对战胜法西斯主义这一事业有过巨大贡献的各国妇女们，是不能忍受这种受压迫的情形的。她们正为争取自己的权利、自己孩子的幸福、民主的自由、民族的独立和反对新战争的威胁而斗争。
    妇女们利用着集会、游行示威、发出请愿书和派遣代表团，要求本国政府使她们享有和男子同样的政治、经济和公民的权利，不玷辱妇女的尊严，关心保护母性和儿童，缩减军事预算，增加用于住房、学校和医院方面的拨款。她们反对物价的不断高涨，要求同工同酬。在许多国家里，妇女们都积极援助了罢工工人和他们的家庭。
    西欧各国的妇女日益积极地反对军备竞赛政策，反对把自己国家拖入那些侵略计划；起来保卫独立和民主的自由。
    西德和日本的妇女，正为反对把自己国家变成新战争的进攻基地而斗争，她们愈来愈坚决地要求废除占领制度，反对奴役性的单独的条约，拥护根据波茨坦协定缔结真正的和约。
    拉丁美洲各国的妇女，正进行着争取独立和民主自由的积极斗争。在这些国家里，已经展开了母亲反对把自己儿子派往朝鲜的广泛运动。由于全体人民斗争的结果，巴西就没派一个士兵到朝鲜去作战。
    愈来愈多的殖民地和附属国家被压迫妇女的阶层，被卷入争取自身权利的斗争，争取独立和自由的民族解放运动。
    朝鲜、越南、马来亚的妇女，同丈夫、儿子和兄弟一起，保卫着自己国家的自由和独立。她们无论在后方、在前线、在游击队里都表现出最伟大的刚毅精神和英勇气概的榜样，以及对胜利的信心。这些国家的人民争取自己解放的斗争，获得全体爱好和平的人类的充分同情。
    一切国家的妇女都在愤懑地抗议朝鲜的血腥战争，她们要求签订停战协定和结束朝鲜战争。在英国，被派到朝鲜去的士兵的亲人们展开了争取他们的子弟和亲人回家和停战的运动。在美国，美国妇女争取和平委员会的会员把那些自己儿子在朝鲜的母亲们的信、呼吁书、电报寄给政府、联合国，要求停止朝鲜战争。
    妇女们在国际民主妇联的旗帜下，进行着争取自己权利、争取和平的斗争。在国际民主妇联的会章里，争取妇女权利的斗争被规定为最重要的任务。国际民主妇联执委会和理事会所召开的那些大会、会议，没有一次不提出关于妇女权利的问题，没有
    一次不采取加强争取这些权利的斗争的种种措施。
    一九五二年，按照国际民主妇联的决议召开了国际保卫儿童大会，会上并提出关于保护母亲权利的各种问题。国际民主妇联之所以进行斗争，乃是要使每一个国家的政府不仅宣布、而且保障妇女的平权地位。
    国际民主妇联为召开第一届世界保卫和平大会的发起人之一。妇女们在国际民主妇联领导下，积极地参加执行世界和平理事会的一切措施。例如，和平公约上的签名，就有一半以上是妇女们征集的。
    为了使妇女在争取自己权利与保卫和平的斗争中更加积极和团结起来，国际民主妇联于本年六月五日至十一日在哥本哈根召开世界妇女大会。大会的第一项议程是：“妇女在争取和保卫妇女作为母亲、工人和公民的权利的斗争中的任务”。
    这次大会的筹备工作，老早就在八十多个国家里广泛地展开了。它是在拥护维也纳世界人民和平大会的各项决议、在争取妇女迫切利益的斗争中建立统一的行动的口号下进行的。
    苏联、中国、人民民主国家的妇女是自由而平权的，她们在建立新的社会制度上起着巨大的作用。这些国家的榜样鼓舞着资本主义、殖民地和附属国家的妇女去为争取自己权利、争取和平、争取自己孩子的幸福而奋斗。
    苏联妇女积极参加国家和社会的生活。将近二千五百名妇女被选为苏联最高苏维埃和加盟与自治共和国最高苏维埃的代表，而五十余万名妇女则被选为地方苏维埃的代表。以下事实说明苏联妇女在共产主义建设中的作用：在从事国民经济工作的全部人数中，妇女约占一半。受过高等教育的妇女专家，数逾九十万。在苏联科学、学校、文教机关中工作的妇女，超过二百五十万名。在全国高等学校和中等专科学校中读书的妇女，超过了一百二十万名。百万以上的妇女从事着保健工作，其中二十二万名是医生，这比沙俄时代的女医生人数高出一百倍。妇女们领导着企业、集体农庄、科学研究院。妇女们都在为完成和超额完成苏联发展第五个五年计划而忘我地劳动，从她们的队伍中涌现出许多生产、运输和农业的革新者。
    苏联妇女代表团参加这次大会，再次表明了苏联妇女和全体苏联人民对于和平、对于巩固与各国人民的友谊和合作、对于扩大与各国妇女的友好联系的意志。
    世界妇女大会标志着妇女民主运动的新阶段。它将在妇女争取自己权利、争取儿童幸福、争取和平与国家独立、争取五大国缔结和平公约的斗争中，
    使她们更紧密地团结起来。
