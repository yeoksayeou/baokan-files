Xinhua News Agency, Rome, June 8th: According to a TASS report from Rome on the 7th, the Italian election campaign officially ended nationwide at midnight on the 5th. The General Secretary of the Communist Party, Togliatti, delivered a speech at a campaign rally in Rome attended by 250,000 citizens.

Togliatti said that in this election, only the progressive parties had put forward a concrete political program and carried out realistic and factual propaganda to the voters. He continued by saying that, on the contrary, the Christian Democratic Party and its allies could not put forward a constructive program, and the facts refuted their propaganda every day. Therefore, they had to lie and slander the Soviet Union, the People's Democratic countries, the Communist Party, and the working people.

Togliatti sharply criticized the leader of the Christian Democratic Party, Gasperi, and accused him of the means he used in the campaign.

Togliatti exposed the reactionary conspiracies of the monarchist party and the neo-fascist party. He emphasized that their opposition to the Christian Democratic Party was only to conceal their intention to implement a more reactionary policy.

Togliatti said that first of all, Italy needs to implement a peaceful policy, which would make it possible to use the hundreds of billions of gold coins now used for armaments to eliminate poverty. There are more than two million unemployed and four million semi-unemployed people in Italy. Six hundred thousand young men and women who are about to start work cannot find jobs.

According to United Nations materials, the living standards of ordinary people in Italy are the lowest in Europe. In the province of Naples, some tenant farmers earn only enough to buy a pack of cigarettes a day. In the Emilia region's garment industry, a twenty-year-old female worker earns 6,000 lire a month, only enough for 10 percent of a family's minimum needs.

To eliminate these phenomena, there is a need for new people in the government who can speak for the working masses.

Togliatti concluded by saying that if the Italian people hope to have a strong, organized, wise, and promising force in the country and in the parliament that can fight for freedom, peace, democracy, and progress, it is necessary to vote for the Communist Party.

The General Secretary of the Italian Socialist Party, Nenni, delivered a speech at a rally of more than 120,000 people in Milan. He called on voters to end the Christian Democratic Party's policy of inciting international disputes and internal discord.

    陶里亚蒂和南尼在竞选大会上发表演说
    号召选民们终止天主教民主党的反动政策
    【新华社八日讯】据塔斯社罗马七日讯：意大利的选举运动已于五日午夜在全国范围内宣告结束。共产党总书记陶里亚蒂在罗马有二十五万市民参加的竞选大会上发表演说。
    陶里亚蒂说，在这次竞选中，只有进步的政党提出了一个具体的政治纲领，并对选民进行了真实的实事求是的宣传。他接着说，相反的，天主教民主党和它的同盟者提不出建设性的纲领，并且事实又在每天驳倒他们的宣传，因此，他们只好扯谎，诽谤苏联、人民民主国家、共产党和劳动人民。
    陶里亚蒂尖锐地批评了天主教民主党领袖加斯贝利，并指责他在竞选中使用的手段。
    陶里亚蒂揭露了保皇党和新法西斯党的反动阴谋，他强调指出，他们口头上反对天主教民主党，不过是想隐瞒他们要执行一种更反动的政策的意图。
    陶里亚蒂说，首先意大利需要实行和平政策，这样就有可能把现在用于军备的数千亿金钱用于消灭贫困现象。意大利有二百多万失业者和四百万半失业者。六十万要开始就业的男女青年都找不到工作。
    根据联合国的材料，意大利普通人的生活水平在欧洲是最低的。在那不勒斯省，有些雇农每天所得的工资只够买一包纸烟。在艾米利亚区服装工业中，二十岁的女工每月挣六千里拉，只够一个家庭的最低限度需要的百分之十。
    要消灭这些现象，就需要在政府中有能够代表劳动群众说话的新人。
    陶里亚蒂最后说，如果意大利人民希望在国内、在议会中有一支能够为自由和平、民主和进步进行斗争的强大的、有组织的、英明有为的力量，投共产党的票是必要的。
    意大利社会党总书记南尼在米兰十二万多人的大会上发表演说，他号召选民们终止天主教民主党所奉行的煽动国际纷争和内部不和的政策。
