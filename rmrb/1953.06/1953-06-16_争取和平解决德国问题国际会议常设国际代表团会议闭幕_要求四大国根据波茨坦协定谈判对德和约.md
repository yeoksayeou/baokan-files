Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, June 15th: The meeting of the Standing International Delegation of the International Conference for a Peaceful Solution to the German Question has closed in Berlin.

British political commentator Gordon Schaffer, Jean-Marie Domenach, editor of the French Catholic newspaper "Esprit," and German representative Otto Buchwitz all delivered reports.

The meeting unanimously adopted a statement and a letter to the German people.

The statement pointed out that striving for negotiations has become the demand of many countries, and they are increasingly firmly putting forward this demand, which may facilitate the convening of a Four Powers conference.

The statement demanded that the Four Powers hold a meeting to discuss a peace treaty with Germany on a legitimate basis. The statement opposed indirectly dragging West Germany into the North Atlantic Treaty through the European Army, believing that this would eliminate the necessary conditions for negotiation.

The statement emphasized that the Four Powers' negotiations can only be conducted in accordance with the Potsdam Agreement; the statement also reminded people of the suggestions made at the Berlin International Conference last November: that the major powers, with the participation of representatives from East and West Germany, should reach an agreement on the main issues concerning the peace treaty, hold free elections, and conclude a peace treaty with a unified German government, and that the status of this Germany must guarantee the security of its neighbors.

The letter to the German people pointed out that the hope for an early armistice in Korea makes all people believe that the situation in other parts of the world may also ease, and at the same time believe that the major powers may hold sincere negotiations.

The letter to the people pointed out that the people of Germany, like the people of France, Italy, Britain, Belgium, the Netherlands, Austria, Switzerland, and the Scandinavian countries, are increasingly clearly aware that the Bonn "General Treaty" and the Paris "European Defense Community" treaty not only cannot fundamentally solve the pressing problems of mankind, but instead cause terrible war dangers. Only by abandoning the Bonn and Paris treaties can the goal of a unified Germany and the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany, which the people of the world desire, be achieved.

The letter to the people called on all German people to strengthen the struggle against war treaties and to resist those who want to push them into the vortex of war again.

The letter to the German people concluded: We believe that now the Four Powers must immediately conduct good-faith and sincere negotiations on a peace treaty with Germany.

    争取和平解决德国问题国际会议常设国际代表团会议闭幕
    要求四大国根据波茨坦协定谈判对德和约
    【新华社十五日讯】据塔斯社柏林十四日讯：争取和平解决德国问题国际会议常设国际代表团会议已在柏林闭幕。
    英国政论家戈登·夏菲尔、法国天主教报纸“灵报”编辑让·玛丽·多门纳克及德国代表奥托·布赫威茨都先后作了报告。
    会议一致通过了一个声明和一封告德国人民书。
    声明指出：为争取谈判而努力已经成为许多国家的要求，它们日益坚决地提出这样的要求，这可能促成四大国会议的召开。
    声明要求四大国举行会议，以便在合法的基础上讨论对德和约。声明反对通过欧洲军的间接方法把西德拖入北大西洋公约，认为这样就会消除谈判的必要条件。
    声明强调：四大国谈判只能根据波茨坦协定来进行；声明并提醒人们注意去年十一月柏林的国际会议所提出的建议，即：大国在东西德代表的参加下就关于和约的主要问题取得协议，举行自由选举，与统一的德国政府缔结和约，而这个德国的地位必须保证它的邻国的安全。
    告德国人民书指出：朝鲜早日停战的希望使得所有人民都相信世界其他部分的局势也可能缓和，同时相信大国可能举行真诚的谈判。
    告人民书指出：德国的人民也和法国、意大利、英国、比利时、荷兰、奥地利、瑞士和斯堪的纳维亚国家人民一样，越来越清楚地认识到波恩“一般性条约”和巴黎“欧洲防务集团”条约不仅根本不能解决人类的切身问题，反而引起了可怕的战争危险。唯有废弃波恩和巴黎条约，才能达到统一德国，缔结德国和全世界人民所渴望的对德和约的目的。
    告人民书号召全体德国人民加强反对战争条约的斗争，反抗那些要把他们再度推入战争漩涡中去的人。
    告德国人民书结语说：我们认为，现在四大国必须立刻就对德和约进行善意和真诚的谈判。
