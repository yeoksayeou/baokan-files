Comrades, representatives, honored guests, international friends:

At the beginning of a new historical period of planned economic construction in our great motherland, in the first year of the first national five-year plan, our Second National Congress of the All-China Youth Federation opens in the capital.

The delegates attending this conference represent youth from all aspects of the country, representing young men and women and youth workers from all regions, sectors, ethnic groups, classes, democratic parties, and religious beliefs. Our congress fully demonstrates the great democratic unity of the national youth in the era of Mao Zedong. We warmly welcome the youth visiting delegation from Tibet and the Changdu region, and all the observers. Holding such a broadly representative national youth congress is a first since the founding of the People's Republic of China. The convening of this congress is worthy of celebration by the national youth.

We warmly welcome all international friends who have come from afar! We welcome Comrade Piero Pieralli, Secretary of the World Federation of Democratic Youth, to personally participate in our conference, and we thank the World Federation of Democratic Youth for its enthusiastic support of our conference. We welcome Comrade A. Slavnov, Deputy Chairman of the Anti-Fascist Committee of Youth of the Soviet Socialist Republics, and Comrade M. Khertzev, First Secretary of the Moscow Regional Committee of the All-Union Leninist Young Communist League, to participate in our conference. Their arrival is of great help in further consolidating the fighting friendship between the youth of China and the Soviet Union and encouraging Chinese youth to learn from the great Soviet youth. We welcome the youth representatives from Poland, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, and the Mongolian People's Republic. We welcome the brave and fighting youth representatives from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. We welcome the youth representatives from Eastern and Western countries—Indonesia, the United Kingdom, France, Australia, Chile, and other countries. We once again thank them for their enthusiastic support and encouragement of our conference. Since the First National Congress of the All-China Youth Federation in May 1949, our great motherland, under the correct leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong and the Communist Party of China, has undergone profound changes in all aspects. In the past four years, the people of our country have won a complete victory in the Liberation War, ended the criminal rule of the American imperialists and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang on the Chinese mainland, and established the People's Republic of China. Moreover, it has powerfully shattered the wild ambition of the American imperialists to invade Korea and then invade China, safeguarding the security and independence of the motherland. At the same time as achieving a great victory in resisting America and aiding Korea, it has basically completed various social reforms, restored the national economy, and the industrial and agricultural production has reached or exceeded the highest level in Chinese history. The face of our motherland has been completely renewed.

Now, when the Second National Congress of the All-China Youth Federation is convened, our motherland is starting its first five-year national construction plan on the solid basis of the above achievements. Building a new China that is independent, prosperous, and strong has been a long-term ideal of the Chinese people. Now, the construction period to realize our ideals has finally arrived.

The national youth is jubilant and welcomes the arrival of this great new historical period, and sincerely thanks Chairman Mao Zedong and the leadership of the Communist Party of China. We deeply know that all our achievements are the result of Chairman Mao Zedong's brilliant application of Marxism-Leninism in the specific practice of the Chinese revolution.

We also sincerely thank the selfless assistance of our great ally—the Soviet Union, the enthusiastic support of the various people's democratic countries, and the support of the working people of the world. This kind of assistance and support makes the national youth even more confident in the future of the motherland.

In the future, in order to transform the motherland from a backward agricultural country into an advanced industrial country, in order to gradually transition to socialism in the motherland's planned construction, in order for the motherland to play its due role in consolidating world peace in the world peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union, the national youth will unite even more closely around the Communist Party of China and resolutely move forward according to the instructions and calls of Chairman Mao Zedong!

Determining the direction of the efforts of the youth of the new China in the new historical period of building the motherland, this is the glorious task of our convening the Second National Congress of the All-China Youth Federation.

Comrades, representatives: Along with the great victories of our country's various tasks in the past four years, the Chinese youth movement has also achieved great achievements under the leadership of the Communist Party of China.

On the front line of defending the motherland, the youth are heroic soldiers.

The Chinese youth has a glorious patriotic tradition. Since the Opium War in 1840, the Chinese youth has been fighting heroically with the Chinese people against imperialism and its running dogs. During the eight-year War of Resistance Against Japan, the youth fought directly with the Japanese imperialists who invaded our country's territory, together with the people. After the founding of the People's Republic of China, the American aggressors launched the war of aggression against Korea and invaded our country's Taiwan. The Chinese youth, together with the national people, responded to the great call of the motherland. In order to defend the motherland and defend the peaceful life, we launched the great movement to resist America and aid Korea. Tens of thousands of young people joined the Chinese People's Volunteers and crossed the Yalu River to fight side by side with the Korean People's Army. Their bravery, tenacity, and high revolutionary heroism in fighting the enemy proved that they were worthy of being outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese people of the Mao Zedong era. The Chinese youth loves the motherland and the people, and absolutely does not allow any imperialist to infringe on their motherland and destroy the peaceful life of our people.

More than 50 percent of the combat heroes on the Korean front are young people. Among them, there is Huang Jiguang, a hero in the style of Matrosov, who suffered seven serious injuries, and finally blocked the enemy's machine gun with his chest, so that our counterattack troops annihilated more than 1,200 enemy troops; there is Qiu Shaoyun, a martyr who sacrificed himself in order to cover his comrades in completing their combat missions, and insisted on not exposing his target; there is Cai Jintong, a fearless hero and an excellent member of the Youth League, who was seriously injured, but still fought on his stomach, eliminating fourteen enemies and crawling back to the position; there is also the great internationalist fighter Luo Shengjiao, who sacrificed his life to save a Korean boy from the ice river; there is also Liu Xingwen, a Miao youth, a first-class merit model League member, who was brave and unyielding in the battle, insisted on the position for two days, and repelled more than ten enemy attacks before sacrificing heroically. These countless heroic figures who are infinitely loyal to the motherland centrally embody the noble qualities of the Chinese people. "The most beloved person," this respectful and unusually kind title for the volunteers, is the lofty evaluation given to them by the people of the motherland.

The youth of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and all the soldiers quickly mastered modern military technology together, making the motherland's army, navy, and air force leap forward and become stronger. On the one hand, they guarded the vast land of the motherland, vigilantly guarding against the invasion of imperialists and remnant bandits on the border day and night, and on the other hand, they diligently carried out production and construction. Our troops opened up transportation and trade roads in the dangerous cliffs of Tibet, turned the uncultivated plateau into arable land, and built water conservancy projects in Xinjiang, on both sides of the Tianshan Mountains, and opened up farmland and pastures. A campaign to eliminate illiteracy was also launched in the entire army of the People's Liberation Army. Due to the efforts of all the soldiers, the People's Liberation Army has become the most educated army in Chinese history.

In the struggle against the aggression of American imperialism, the youth of all ethnic groups and all classes in China also showed the same enthusiasm and heroism as the soldiers in the front, and actively supported the struggle to resist America and aid Korea. It should be pointed out that the victory on the front line is inseparable from their efforts.

The youth were active leaders in the social reform movement. The vast majority of rural youth participated in the struggle to destroy the feudal system, and played a great role in completing the land reform in the area of 450 million agricultural population. In the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" struggles, in consolidating the people's democratic dictatorship, and resolutely fighting against counter-revolutionary elements, the vast number of young people enthusiastically participated in propaganda, mobilization, and reporting work. In addition, young people have been more active in intellectual ideological reform and other movements. Facts have proved that young people are always the most enthusiastic reformers and are always the force that dares to fight against old and corrupt phenomena.

Through a series of social reform movements, the consciousness of the youth has been greatly improved, and they love the motherland, the people, labor, and learning even more. The new style of hard work, bravery, and simplicity has been established.

In terms of industrial and agricultural production, youth is also an indispensable force.

Young people deeply understand the importance of the industrialization of the motherland. In the past four years, they have continuously poured into the ranks of our country's industrial workers. Now, about half of the industrial workers in the country are young workers, and in some units, they even reach 70 to 80 percent. A large number of young activists have emerged in the scientific and technological team that builds the motherland. The geological exploration team that investigates underground resources is mostly young people. Young workers are particularly enthusiastic about learning technology and are easy to accept new things. They can learn technical operations in a relatively short period of time. Many advanced Soviet experiences are often first learned and actively applied by young workers. The vast number of young workers enthusiastically participated in the patriotic production increase and conservation movement and put forward tens of thousands of rationalization proposals. In the new China, labor has become a glorious cause, and engaging in creative labor is the enthusiastic wish of countless young workers. They showed a high degree of initiative and enthusiasm in their work, and used their selfless spirit to overcome all difficulties to increase production. Young industrial labor models are constantly emerging. For example, there are more than 81,000 Youth League members in the railway system, and a total of 18,780 people were awarded the titles of labor hero, labor model, and various awards last year. Among the 2,400 industrial models in Shanxi Province, young people account for 750. At the same time, we can also cite brilliant examples of many nationally renowned young industrial models: such as Hao Jianxiu, who created a fine yarn work method to reduce the skin roller flower rate. If her work method is promoted nationwide, at least 44,460 more pieces of yarn can be produced each year, which can be used by 4 million people for one year. Another example is Gu Faming, a labor model in the vertical shaft of Fuxin Coal Mine, who absorbed the advanced Soviet experience of parallel operation and created a new record of a comprehensive progress of 75 meters per month. Another example is Zheng Xikun, a railway worker who actively promoted the "full load and over-axle 500-kilometer movement." His own chartered car group has safely traveled 260,000 kilometers and exceeded 78,000 tons of axles in two years and three months. Because of the "full load and over-axle 500-kilometer movement," the entire railway has been promoted to carry out a series of reforms, which greatly improved the efficiency of railway transportation. Another example is Guo Xiuyun, the creator of the new long-distance telephone operation method. If her operation method is promoted nationwide, the effective utilization rate of long-distance telephone circuits nationwide can be increased by more than 22 percent, which can save the state more than 380 billion yuan in basic construction funds for long-distance telephone lines. Another example is Su Changyou, the squad leader of the bricklaying team of the Northeast Industrial Department Construction Company, who created the segmented continuous bricklaying method, which increased the bricklaying efficiency by 128 percent. Another example is Peng Songfu, the creator of the quick-learning teaching method for lathe workers. The quick-learning teaching method he created can enable apprentices to understand the basic knowledge of lathe workers and master the basic operation methods of lathe workers more proficiently within three months, opening up a shortcut for cultivating a large number of workers in the future. These examples fully prove that our young workers are a huge labor force, and they can undertake the construction tasks handed over by the motherland. It can be foreseen that due to their hard work with adults, many new industrial bases will quickly rise on the vast territory of the motherland. And make the life of our people constantly rise to a higher level.

Agricultural production currently still accounts for a large proportion of our entire national economy. The youth also plays an active role in this regard. The vast number of young peasants are active participants in the patriotic production increase movement and the mutual aid and cooperation movement. In the struggle to increase the yield per unit area, they actively learned advanced agricultural experience and mastered advanced technology, so their output has been greatly improved. For example, Chen Yike in Jiangxi Province created a high yield of 1,431 jin of rice per mu. Another example is Shen Jilan in Shanxi Province, she is the well-known deputy director of the Li Shunda Agricultural, Forestry and Animal Husbandry Production Cooperative; in 1952, the total cultivated land output of this cooperative was 110 percent higher than that of the local area. There are also well-known labor models such as Wang Bosheng, a youth labor model of the Xinjiang Military Region with a wheat yield of 1,057 jin per mu, and Zhang Xiuquan of Shanxi with a cotton yield of 1,015 jin per mu. The development of agricultural production has strongly supported industrial construction, and young farmers are looking forward to the bright prospect of moving from mutual aid and cooperation to collectivization.

We must also mention that in the water conservancy projects vigorously built under the instructions of Chairman Mao Zedong, the Huaihe River project alone involved more than 2 million young people, including outstanding model figures like Jin Xiulan, who created a method of digging thin mud and saved 703,000 workdays. Historical disasters have given way to human tenacity for the first time. Young workers and young farmers have played a great role in completing this unprecedentedly huge water conservancy project in China.

The Communist Party and the People's Government have created many universities, specialized colleges, secondary technical schools, and worker-peasant short-term middle schools to train young people to become useful talents in national construction. A large number of young workers and students are studying hard, preparing to serve the country's construction. A large number of young workers have been promoted to leading cadres of production and have become a new force in construction. The Communist Party has paid special attention to the political and ideological education of young people. Therefore, the consciousness of workers and peasants has been further improved, and the sense of being the masters of the country has been more firmly established. Labor has further tempered the organization and discipline of the youth. Young people have also been transformed themselves in the construction of the motherland. An army of production and construction with excellent moral qualities, selfless labor enthusiasm, and mastered technology has been continuously developing and growing in the past four years.

A large number of young cultural fighters have now spread to various departments of education, literature and art, health, scientific research, and military cultural work. They have become the grass-roots force of the powerful cultural army that our country has never had in its history. Many of them have outstanding achievements. Qi Jianhua, a young cultural teacher in the army, created a quick literacy method, which has made the army's literacy work leap forward. It is particularly important to mention that young people account for a very large proportion of the millions of primary school teachers in the country. They have worked hard in the great work of cultivating the next generation for the motherland. Here we want to mention the names of model teachers Shi Ruifen and Lu Jingxian. Because they love their work, they have created glorious examples worthy of respect and learning by everyone.

In the past four years, the number of students at all levels of schools has been compared with the highest number in the era of Kuomintang reactionary rule. If the highest number in the era of Kuomintang reactionary rule is 100, then the number of primary school students we have now is 211.3 percent, the number of middle school students is 164.8 percent, and the number of students in specialized schools and universities is 156.3 percent. The living expenses of all students in our universities, teachers colleges, secondary technical schools, and worker-peasant short-term middle schools are provided by the state, and a large number of middle school students can receive scholarships. This has given the children of workers and peasants wide opportunities to enjoy secondary and higher education. At present, the proportion of workers and peasants among college students has reached more than 20 percent, middle school students have reached more than 60 percent, and primary school students have reached more than 80 percent. The Party and the People's Government have prepared all the conditions necessary for young people to seek knowledge. The quality of education and the material equipment of schools are constantly improving. The youth deeply feel the happiness of living in the era of Mao Zedong. Among the students, hard work and diligence in study have become a new trend.

Under the kind care of the Party and Chairman Mao Zedong, the cultural and educational undertakings of all ethnic minorities have been greatly developed. During the reactionary rule, there were almost no middle schools in the areas inhabited by various ethnic minorities, and some had no schools at all. According to incomplete statistics in January 1953, there are now three universities specifically established for ethnic minorities, with a total of more than 2,300 students, eight ethnic minority institutes with more than 4,000 students, and 162 secondary schools with more than 89,400 students, and primary school students have reached more than 1,474,000. Before the liberation of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, the illiteracy rate in the region was more than 90 percent of the total population. Now more than 80 percent of the children of the working people have entered schools. The enrollment rate of Korean children in the Northeast has reached about 92 percent of school-age children. Under the leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong, the great motherland is a large family of friendly cooperation among all ethnic groups. The youth of ethnic minorities are growing up under the brilliant banner of Chairman Mao Zedong and are creating a bright future for their motherland together with the people of all ethnic groups.

The youth of all ethnic groups, all sectors, and all classes across the country have played an active role on all fronts of the motherland. For example, the youth of all ethnic minorities have played an active role in promoting ethnic regional autonomy, strengthening ethnic unity, and other work, and many model cases have emerged. For example, Qu Meibazhen, a Tibetan girl in Dege County, Xikang, brought her cattle and horses to participate in supporting the transportation work of the troops entering Tibet after the liberation of Dege. She cherished the people's materials as much as her own and was rated as a transportation model. Another example is Ma Jiujia, a Tibetan youth in the pastoral area of Xiahe, Gansu, who was rated as a "unity hero" for mediating tribal disputes at the risk of his life. Another example is Saren, a Mongolian female labor model, who is an excellent tractor driver in the famous Liang Jun female tractor team, who created a new national record of planting 4.63 hectares per hour last year. Many young people in the industrial and commercial circles took the lead in abiding by government laws and cooperated with state-owned enterprises in production. Urban social youth have become one of the assistants of the grass-roots organizations of the street party and government in various movements. Many young people in the religious circles are carrying out long-term and complex struggles against the imperialists in religious disguise in the patriotic movement.

Due to the above efforts and contributions of the youth, their social and political status has been improved.

Our People's Government attaches great importance to the active role of youth in national political activities, and a large number of young cadres have been absorbed into various state organs. In the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the representatives of youth organizations totaled 31. In the local people's representative conferences, youth representatives also account for a considerable proportion. According to statistics from 12 cities including Beijing and Shanghai, youth organization representatives account for about 7 percent of the total number of representatives to the people's representative conferences. According to Article 4 of the "Election Law of the National People's Congress and Local People's Congresses of the People's Republic of China" promulgated on March 1 this year, it is estimated that more than 60 million young people aged 18 to 25 across the country will obtain the right to vote and be elected. The Chinese youth deeply experiences that they are the masters of the country, and feel the glory and pride of being citizens of great China. Therefore, studying harder, working more actively, and contributing all their strength to the country, and further advancing the construction cause of the national people has become a major responsibility and sacred obligation of the Chinese youth to the motherland.

The Chinese youth is concerned about expanding and consolidating the unity of the world youth and is loyal to the cause of defending world peace. We support the various activities of the World Federation of Democratic Youth and maintain close contact with youth organizations in various countries. Our youth representatives have attended various international youth conferences and visited 20 countries. We have received youth representatives from two international youth organizations and 45 countries to visit China. Through these international activities, the Chinese youth has received internationalist education, has been greatly encouraged, has strengthened friendship with the youth of various countries, and has expressed the Chinese youth's determination and strength to build a happy life and defend peace.

The All-China Federation of Democratic Youth is the common organization of the national youth. Since the First National Congress of the Youth, the organization of the All-China Federation of Democratic Youth has been greatly developed. At present, the organization of the All-China Federation of Democratic Youth includes four national organizations (the Chinese New Democratic Youth League, the All-China Students' Federation, the YMCA of China, and the YWCA of China) and 108 provincial and municipal federations of democratic youth. Through youth congresses, representative meetings, and other forms, the youth federations at all levels have established contact with the broad masses of youth, becoming a link for the Party and the government to listen to the opinions and demands of the broad masses of youth, convey policies and laws, and mobilize youth from all aspects to participate in various movements.

Comrades, representatives, the Chinese youth movement has made important achievements in the past four years. Both in terms of scale and content, it is unparalleled in any period in the history of the Chinese youth movement. The reason why we have been able to achieve the above achievements is inseparable from our people's democratic social system and state system; it is inseparable from the great achievements of the national people's various tasks in the past four years; especially it is inseparable from the wise leadership of the Communist Party of China and our great leader Chairman Mao Zedong. He made it possible for the youth's enthusiasm and wisdom to be correctly exerted. He made it possible for the forces of the vast number of youth in the motherland to gather and unite together, like a torrent, advancing towards victory.

Although the Chinese youth movement has made major developments in the past four years, we must not be complacent because of this. There are still serious shortcomings in our work, such as our failure to systematically summarize the experiences and lessons of youth work on the production and construction front, and to give active and specific guidance; in particular, some youth organizations and youth cadres still lack industrial and agricultural production knowledge and have not paid attention to this aspect of work, so they cannot get into it, which has created new difficulties for us in welcoming the construction period of the motherland. Secondly, our unity is not broad enough. In the past, not only did we not do enough work among the youth of ethnic minorities, the youth of the industrial and commercial circles, the urban social youth, and the religious youth, but even among the workers, peasants, and intellectual youth, who were relatively widely mobilized, the mobilization of the youth movement was not wide enough. In some areas, the youth work was only limited to a small circle of activists. Advanced youth often had prominent and rash emotions, and the forms of activities were not rich and diverse enough. We are not good at leading the general youth to advance together. We must overcome the above shortcomings in our future work.

The Chinese youth, who has experienced various serious tests, is strong and courageous. Under the victorious banner of Mao Zedong, we are prepared to overcome any difficulties on the road forward and complete all the tasks assigned to us by Chairman Mao Zedong.

Comrades, representatives! Under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong and the Communist Party of China, the national people have victoriously completed the tasks of the economic recovery period. Now our country has entered the construction period.

In the construction period, the most basic task of the Democratic Youth League is, under the leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong and the Communist Party of China, to contact and educate the youth, constantly improve the consciousness and organization of the youth, with the Chinese New Democratic Youth League as the core, unite the democratic youth of all classes, and work with the national people to actively complete the national construction plan and strive for the gradual realization of the national industrialization and the gradual transition to socialist society.

This year our country has already begun to implement the first five-year plan. The completion and overfulfillment of this plan require the national people to make great efforts in all aspects. At the same time, it requires the national democratic youth to have a firm, vigorous, and fearless spirit to respond to the call of the motherland and contribute their strength to the country from different positions and complete the tasks given to themselves by the motherland.

The youth of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers must work hard to learn advanced Soviet military science and technology, study politics and culture, strengthen their physique, and build a modern national defense army, and strive to consolidate national defense and defend the motherland.

Young workers should actively participate in patriotic labor competitions, tap production potential, increase labor productivity, improve product quality, save raw materials, reduce costs, and strive to complete and overfulfill the production plan. Young workers should study politics hard, establish a correct attitude towards labor, exemplarily abide by labor discipline, and strictly implement operating procedures and security systems; they should humbly learn from adult workers, learn from advanced producers, learn advanced working methods, and learn advanced Soviet experience.

Young men and women in the countryside should actively participate in agricultural production, and develop mutual aid and cooperative organizations based on the private property of peasants in a step-by-step manner according to the principles of voluntariness and mutual benefit, while protecting individual households; young peasants should be good at cooperating with experienced adult farmers and learn from them, improve work skills, deep ploughing and careful cultivation, processing and fertilization, improve seeds, prevent pests and diseases, build water conservancy projects, prevent floods and droughts, protect forests and afforestation, carry out patriotic production increase campaigns, and increase the yield per unit area, and strive to complete and exceed the agricultural production increase plan.

Young workers in the national trade organs and cooperatives should conscientiously study the government's trade and cooperation policies, work hard to study their business, frequently understand the needs of the country and the people, unite with all trade and cooperation workers, complete the national procurement and sales plan, implement the economic accounting system, reduce commodity circulation costs, accelerate capital turnover, and strive to develop the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas to better serve industrial and agricultural production and serve consumers and members.

Young staff members of state organs and all people's organizations should work hard to study Marxism-Leninism, improve their theoretical policies and professional level, abide by national discipline, work actively, constantly improve work efficiency, consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship, promote a clean, simple, and contact with the people's revolutionary work style, and wholeheartedly and realistically serve the interests of the people.

Youths of all ethnic groups should play an exemplary leading role in strengthening the cause of national unity, and strive to jointly oppose imperialist aggression and build an independent, unified, prosperous, and great motherland; promote ethnic regional autonomy, and strive to develop the economy, culture, medicine and health work in the ethnic minority areas, and gradually improve the lives of the people of all ethnic groups.

Young men and women students should study scientific knowledge hard, improve their political level, exercise their bodies, and prepare to serve the motherland.

Young educators should work hard to learn advanced Soviet experience in education, use advanced scientific knowledge, revolutionary ideas, and the spirit of combining patriotism and internationalism to educate young people and children, popularize and improve cultural and educational undertakings, and train more talents for the country.

Young scientific and technical personnel should closely contact the workers and peasants, work hard to learn advanced Soviet science and technology, absorb the practical experience of the workers and peasants, actively help young workers and peasants improve their production skills, and strive to carry out scientific research and technological improvement work, and strive to continuously improve their scientific and technical level and help the country train a large number of new technical personnel.

Young literary and artistic workers should work hard to study Marxist-Leninist literary and artistic theory, follow the direction pointed out by Chairman Mao of serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers, experience in the actual life and struggle of the masses, improve artistic cultivation, and express the heroic images emerging from the people and youth of our country, and create more works of a thought-provoking and artistic nature that are loved by the people and youth.

Young sports workers should promote mass sports activities among the national youth and strive to enhance the people's physique.

Young medical and health care workers and childcare workers should work hard to learn advanced Soviet medical and health science and technology, pay attention to the health care of women and children, so that the younger generation can grow up more lively and stronger; go deep into the countryside to treat diseases for the masses, continue to participate in the patriotic health movement, and strive to improve the people's health.

Young industrialists and businessmen should, under the leadership of the People's Government and the state-owned economy, follow the track of the Common Program, promote all industrialists and businessmen, prevent repeating the illegal behaviors of the "Five Poisons," and strive to operate economic undertakings that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood.

Young religious believers should carry forward the spirit of patriotism and actively participate in the struggle against imperialist aggression and defense of peace.

The national youth must study and publicize the "Election Law of the National People's Congress and Local People's Congresses of the People's Republic of China," and actively participate in the national election movement. The Democratic Youth Federation and its organizations at all levels should mobilize all the youth to actively support those who serve the motherland and the people loyally, those who are deemed satisfactory and necessary by the people, as representatives of the people, and at the same time elect those who maintain close ties with the youth, are familiar with and concerned about the interests of the people and the vital demands of the youth, and are enthusiastically supported by the youth, as youth representatives to participate in people's congresses at all levels. We must, through the national election movement, further improve the political enthusiasm of the national youth and give play to the role of youth in the national political construction.

These are the specific tasks of the youth in all aspects of the country in the national construction period.

In order to complete the basic tasks of the Democratic Youth Federation and the above specific tasks in the national construction period, we must fully utilize the experience gained in the past four years on the basis of the existing achievements of the Chinese youth movement, and improve our work in the following aspects.

First, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the Chinese youth movement must become a component of the overall construction cause of the national people, and closely combine the mobilization of the youth to complete the above tasks of the national construction period with appropriately taking care of the special interests and vital demands of the youth. The experience of the past four years has proved that the development of the Chinese youth movement is precisely because, on the one hand, it has prevented and corrected the erroneous tendency of unilaterally emphasizing the special interests of the youth while disregarding the overall interests of the country, and on the other hand, it has opposed bureaucracy that is indifferent to the vital demands of the youth. Therefore, in our future work, we must pay attention to appropriately and not isolatedly satisfying the vital demands of the youth when mobilizing the youth to complete the central tasks of the country, so as to enable the enthusiasm and creativity of the youth to be given greater play, make the youth work more full of vitality, and more widely mobilize the youth, strengthen organization, consolidate unity, and strive to complete the tasks given to the youth by the country.

Second, we must strengthen the youth's study. The characteristics of the youth are enthusiasm and activity, but they lack knowledge and experience. Therefore, the task of study must be emphasized in front of all the youth. The Chinese youth must remember Comrade Stalin's teachings: "To build, one must have knowledge, one must master science. And to have knowledge, one must study," and deeply understand that study is an outstanding task of the Chinese youth in the national construction period, and carry out humble and diligent study. The youth should study culture, study scientific knowledge, study production knowledge, and study professional skills; at the same time, they should also study Comrade Mao Zedong's works, study the spirit of patriotism and internationalism, study revolutionary theory, and study the policies of the Communist Party of China and the People's Government. The Chinese youth must, through these studies, not only enable themselves to have a skill, specialized scientific knowledge, and professional skills, so that they can provide practical and effective contributions to the national construction cause in different positions; but also enable themselves to have a high degree of political consciousness, good moral qualities, be loyal to the motherland, loyal to the people, loyal to Chairman Mao Zedong's ideals and cause, be able to closely contact the masses, and wholeheartedly serve the interests of the people. That is to say, we must, through these studies, enable the Chinese youth to connect their daily work in various positions with the great future of the national construction cause—gradually realizing the national industrialization and gradually transitioning to socialist society—so that they can strive to realize this future in their daily work; enable the Chinese youth to become good students of Mao Zedong, become outstanding defenders and builders of the new China, always trust the Communist Party of China, and always guarantee that under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, they will struggle to the end for the bright future of the national people and the national youth. Therefore, youth organizations at all levels should actively assist relevant parties in conscientiously organizing the youth's study, and constantly check and summarize the achievements and experiences of the study, in order to encourage the youth's confidence in progress. At the same time, sports activities and recreational activities should also be universally carried out among the youth, so that every youth understands that building national defense, developing production, and participating in various work must have a healthy physique and a happy spirit, so as to better serve the country's construction cause.

Third, we must expand and strengthen the unity of the youth, and establish a broad youth united front work. Domestically, the All-China Federation of Democratic Youth is the organization of the national democratic youth united front. Participating in this organization are the national youth organizations and the organizations of the democratic youth federations at all levels in the provinces and cities. The historical experience of the Chinese revolution proves that the broad masses of young intellectuals and students are an important component of the Chinese youth movement, but they must be combined with the workers and peasants in order to form a strong force. This is the great instruction given to us by Chairman Mao Zedong. China's broad united front of youth is based on young workers and peasants and revolutionary young intellectuals, but on the basis of fully mobilizing the broad masses of young workers and peasants and revolutionary young intellectuals, we must also sufficiently value and expand the unity of the youth among ethnic minorities, the national bourgeoisie, the urban petty bourgeoisie, religious circles, and technical personnel in order to organize the vast majority of the youth to participate in national construction. Since the youth in factories, rural areas, government agencies, schools, and troops have already participated in the organizations in their respective fields and no separate organizations of democratic youth federations have been established, and since the work of the youth among ethnic minorities, the national bourgeoisie, the urban petty bourgeoisie, religious circles, and technical personnel is very poor, therefore, in the future, in order to consolidate and expand the unity of the youth of all sectors, the democratic youth federations in various places should take these youth as the main objects of their work and strengthen their work among these youth. The Democratic Youth Federation should especially strengthen the youth work in ethnic minority areas, strive to increase the contact between the youth of all ethnic groups, increase the mutual understanding of the youth of all ethnic groups, and promote the youth of all ethnic groups to play an exemplary leading role in strengthening and consolidating the cause of national unity. The organizations of the democratic youth federations in various provinces and major administrative regions should take helping and specifically guiding the work of the democratic youth federations in various ethnic minority areas as their primary task. Internationally, the All-China Federation

    为保卫祖国和建设祖国而奋斗
    ——一九五三年六月十日在中华全国青年第二次代表大会上的报告
    廖承志亲爱的代表同志们，来宾们，国际朋友们：
    在我们伟大的祖国进行有计划经济建设的新的历史时期的开始的时候，在第一个国家五年建设计划的第一年，我们中华全国青年第二次代表大会在首都开幕了。
    出席这次大会的代表，代表了全国各方面的青年。代表了各地、各界、各民族、各阶层、各个民主党派、各种宗教信仰的男女青年和青年工作者。我们的代表大会充分地表现了毛泽东时代的全国青年的民主大团结。我们热烈欢迎西藏和昌都地区的青年参观团各位列席代表。召开这样具有广泛的代表性的全国青年的大会，是中华人民共和国成立以来的第一次。这个代表大会的召开，是值得我们全国青年欢呼庆祝的。
    我们代表大会热烈欢迎不远万里而来的各位国际友人！我们欢迎世界民主青年联盟的书记皮埃罗·皮埃拉利同志亲自来参加我们的大会，我们感谢世界民主青年联盟对我们大会的热烈支持。我们欢迎苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟青年反法西斯委员会副主席亚·斯拉夫诺夫同志和苏联列宁共产主义青年团莫斯科州委第一书记米·赫尔捷耶夫同志参加我们的大会，他们的到来，对进一步巩固中苏两国青年间的战斗友谊和鼓励中国青年向伟大的苏联青年学习有莫大的帮助。我们欢迎波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、保加利亚、蒙古人民共和国的青年代表，我们欢迎勇敢的、战斗的朝鲜民主主义人民共和国、越南民主共和国的青年代表。我们欢迎东方和西方国家——印尼、英国、法国、澳大利亚、智利等国家的青年代表们。我们再一次感谢他们对我们的大会的热烈支持和鼓励。从一九四九年五月中华全国青年第一次代表大会以来，我们伟大的祖国，在毛泽东主席和中国共产党的正确领导之下，各方面都经历了深刻的变化。四年中间，我国人民赢得了解放战争的彻底胜利，结束了美帝国主义和蒋介石匪帮在中国大陆上的罪恶统治，成立了中华人民共和国。并有力地击破了美帝国主义企图侵略朝鲜并进而侵略中国的狂妄阴谋，保卫了祖国的安全和独立。而且在获得抗美援朝巨大胜利的同时，基本上完成了各种社会改革，恢复了国民经济，工农业生产达到或超过了中国历史上最高的水平。我们祖国的面貌已经是焕然一新了。
    现在，当全国青年第二次代表大会召开的时候，我们的祖国正在上述成就的坚固基础上，开始了第一个五年国家建设计划。建设独立富强的新中国，曾是中国人民长期的理想。现在，实现我们的理想的建设时期终于来到了。
    全国青年欢欣鼓舞，迎接这个伟大的新的历史时期的到来，衷心感谢毛泽东主席和中国共产党的领导。我们深深知道，我们所有的成就，都是毛泽东主席在中国革命的具体实践中光辉地运用马克思列宁主义的结果。
    我们也衷心感谢伟大的盟邦——苏联的无私援助，感谢各人民民主国家的热诚支援，感谢全世界劳动人民的支持，这种援助和支持，使全国青年对祖国的将来更充满了信心。
    今后，为着祖国由落后的农业国转变为先进的工业国，为着祖国在有计划的建设中逐步过渡到社会主义，为着祖国在以苏联为首的世界和平民主阵营中对巩固世界和平起它应有的作用，全国青年将更加紧密地团结在中国共产党的周围，坚决按照毛泽东主席的指示和号召，向前迈进！
    在建设祖国的新的历史时期中，确定新中国青年的努力方向，这就是我们召开全国青年第二次代表大会的光辉任务。
    代表同志们：随着我国四年来各项工作的伟大胜利，中国青年运动在中国共产党领导下也同样取得了很大的成绩。
    在保卫祖国的战线上，青年们是英勇的战士。
    中国青年有着光辉的爱国主义传统，从一八四○年的鸦片战争以来，中国青年和中国人民在一起，不屈不挠地向帝国主义及其走狗作英勇的斗争；在八年抗日战争期间，青年们和人民在一起直接和侵占我国国土的日本帝国主义者搏斗。在中华人民共和国成立以后，美国侵略者发动侵朝战争，侵略我国台湾，中国青年和全国人民在一起响应了祖国的伟大的召唤，为了保卫祖国、保卫和平生活，开展了伟大的抗美援朝运动。成千成万的青年参加中国人民志愿军，渡过鸭绿江与朝鲜人民军并肩作战。他们在对敌作战中的英勇、顽强和高度的革命英雄主义，证明了自己不愧为毛泽东时代的中华人民的优秀儿女。中国青年热爱祖国，热爱人民，绝对不容许任何一个帝国主义侵犯自己的祖国，破坏我们人民的和平生活。
    在朝鲜前线百分之五十以上的战斗英雄都是青年。他们中间，有马特洛索夫式的英雄黄继光，他身受七处重伤，最后仍以自己的胸膛抵住敌人的机枪眼，使我反击部队全歼守敌一千二百余人；有为了掩护战友完成战斗任务，坚持不暴露目标，因而牺牲的邱少云烈士；有优秀的青年团员无畏的英雄蔡金同，身负重伤，仍按腹奋战，消灭十四个敌人而又爬回阵地；还有伟大的国际主义战士罗盛教，为由冰河中救出朝鲜少年而牺牲了自己的生命；还有一等功臣模范团员苗族青年刘兴文，在战斗中英勇不屈，坚持阵地两天，打退敌人十余次进攻之后，壮烈牺牲。这些数不尽的无限忠诚于祖国的英雄人物，集中表现了中国人民高贵的品质。“最可爱的人”，这个满怀崇敬而又异常亲切的对志愿军的称呼，便是祖国人民给予他们的崇高评价。
    中国人民解放军的青年和全体战士一起迅速掌握了现代化的军事技术，使祖国的陆、海、空军飞跃地强大起来。他们一方面守卫着祖国广大的土地，在边疆日夜警惕着帝国主义和残余匪帮的侵犯，一方面又勤劳地进行着生产和建设。我们的部队，在西藏的危崖峭壁中间开出运输贸易的大道，把无人垦殖的高原变成耕地，在新疆、在天山南北兴修了水利，开辟了农田和牧场。在解放军全军中还展开了扫除文盲运动，由于全体战士的努力，已经使解放军成为中国历史上最有教育修养的军队了。
    在反抗美帝国主义侵略的斗争中，全中国各民族、各阶层的青年，也表现了和前方战士一样的热诚和英勇，积极支持了抗美援朝的斗争。应当指出，前方的胜利，和他们的努力是分不开的。
    青年们在社会改革运动中都是积极带头的。农村青年中绝大部分参加了摧毁封建制度的斗争，对完成四亿五千万农业人口地区的土地改革，起了很大作用。在“三反”、“五反”斗争中，在巩固人民民主专政，坚决向反革命分子进行斗争中，广大青年都热诚地参加了宣传鼓动和检举工作。此外，青年在知识分子思想改造等运动中，更有积极的表现。事实证明，青年永远是最热心的革新者、始终是勇于同陈旧腐败现象奋斗的力量。
    通过一系列的社会改革运动，青年的觉悟已大大提高，更加热爱祖国，热爱人民，热爱劳动，热爱学习。勤劳、勇敢、朴素的新作风已经树立起来了。
    在工农业生产方面，青年同样是一个不可忽视的力量。
    青年们深知祖国工业化的重要，四年来，他们源源不绝地涌入了我国产业工人的队伍。现在，全国产业工人中，约有半数是青年工人，在有些单位中，甚至达到百分之七、八十。在建设祖国的科学技术队伍中，涌现了大量青年积极分子。勘察地下资源的地质勘察队，其中绝大部分是青年。青年工人学习技术的热情特别高，容易接受新鲜事物，在较短的时间内能学会技术操作。许多苏联先进经验，往往是由青年工人首先学习并积极应用起来的。广大的青年工人热烈参加了爱国增产节约运动，提出了数以万计的合理化建议。在新中国，劳动已经成为光荣的事业，从事创造性的劳动，是无数青年工人热诚的愿望。他们在劳动中表现了高度的主动性和积极性，用奋不顾身的精神去克服一切困难，来增加生产。青年的工业劳动模范正在不断地涌现出来。举例来说，铁道系统有八万一千多青年团员，去年得到劳动英雄、劳动模范称号及各种奖励的共一万八千七百八十余人。山西全省二千四百多名工业模范中，青年占七百五十名。同时我们还可以举出许多全国闻名的青年工业模范的光辉例子：如创造细纱工作法降低了皮辊花率的郝建秀，全国如将她的工作法加以推广，则每年少出的皮辊花，至少可以多生产四万四千四百六十件纱，可供四百万人一年之用。再如阜新煤矿竖井劳动模范谷发明，吸取苏联先进的平行作业法的经验，创造了月进七十五公尺综合进度的新记录。又如“满载超轴五百公里运动”的积极推动者铁路工人郑锡坤，仅他自己的包车组在二年零三个月的时间内共安全行车二十六万公里，超轴七万八千多吨，并由于开展了“满载超轴五百公里运动”，因而推动了整个铁路进行一系列的改革，大大提高了铁路运输的效率。又如长途电话新操作法的创造者郭秀云，她的操作法如在全国推广，可以使全国长途电话的电路有效利用率提高百分之二十二以上，可以为国家节省三千八百余亿元的长途电话线路的基本建设资金。再如，东北工业部建设公司瓦工班长苏长有，创造了分段连续砌砖法，使砌砖效率提高了百分之一百二十八。又如，车工技术速成教学法的创造者彭松福，所创造的速成教学法能使学徒在三个月内懂得车工基本知识和较熟练地掌握车工基本操作方法，为今后大量培养工人开辟了捷径。这些例子充分地证明了：我国的青年工人是一个巨大的劳动力量，他们担当得起祖国交下来的建设任务。可以预见到，由于他们与成年人在一起的辛勤劳动，将使祖国广大的疆土上，迅速兴起许许多多新型的工业基地。并使我国人民的生活不断上升到更高的水平。
    农业生产，目前还在我国整个国民经济中占着很大的比重。青年们在这方面也起着积极作用，广大的青年农民是爱国增产运动和互助合作运动的积极参加者。他们在提高单位面积产量的斗争中，积极学习农业先进经验，掌握了先进技术，因而他们的产量大大的提高了。如江西省陈翊科，创造了每亩净收稻谷一千四百三十一斤的高额产量。又如山西省申纪兰，她是有名的李顺达农林畜牧生产合作社的副社长；一九五二年这个合作社全社耕地产量，较当地高出百分之一百一十。还有每亩小麦产量一千零五十七斤的新疆军区青年劳动模范王柏生及每亩棉花产量一千零十五斤的山西张秀全等那样著名的劳动模范。农业生产的发展，有力地支援了工业建设，青年农民更向往着从互助合作走向集体化的光明的远景。
    我们还必须提到，在毛泽东主席指示下大力兴修的水利工程中，仅仅治淮工程，就有二百多万青年参加，其中有像创造挖稀泥方法节省七十万三千工作日的金秀兰那样杰出的模范人物。历史性的灾害，第一次在人的顽强意志面前退让了。对中国这个前所未有的巨大的水利工程的完成，青年工人和青年农民都起了很大的作用。
    共产党和人民政府为培养青年成为国家建设中的有用的人才，创设了许多大学、专门学院、中等技术学校和工农速成中学。大批的青年工人和学生正在顽强地学习，准备为建设国家服务。青年工人大批的被提拔为生产的领导干部，成为建设中新生的力量。共产党特别注意了对青年的政治思想教育。因此，工农青年的觉悟更加提高了，主人翁思想是更坚定地树立起来了。劳动也进一步锻炼了青年们的组织性纪律性。青年人在积极参加改变祖国面貌的建设事业中，自己也得到了改造。一支具有优秀道德品质、忘我的劳动热情并且掌握了技术的生产建设大军，四年来正在不断的发展、壮大。
    大批青年文化战士现已遍布在教育、文艺、卫生、科学研究以及部队文化工作各个部门，他们已成为我国历史上从来没有过的强大的文化大军的基层力量。他们中间很多人有杰出的成绩，部队青年文化教员祁建华创造了速成识字法，使部队的扫除文盲工作得到飞跃的进展。特别要提起在全国百万小学教师中，青年占极大比例，他们在为祖国培育着下一代的伟大工作中进行了辛勤的劳动。这里我们要提到模范教师史瑞芬、吕敬先的名字，由于她们热爱自己的工作，她们已经创造了值得大家尊敬和学习的光荣范例。
    四年来，各级学校学生的数字与国民党反动统治时代的最高数字相比，如果以国民党反动统治时期的最高数字为一百，那么我们现在的小学学生人数为百分之二一一·三，中学生人数为百分之一六四·八，专门学校和大学学生人数为百分之一五六·三。我们所有高等学校、师范学校、中等技术学校、工农速成中学全部学生的生活费用，均由国家供给，中学生有很大部分可以得到助学金。这就使得工人和农民的子女获得了享受中等的和高等的教育的广泛机会。现在大学生中工农成份已达百分之二十以上，中学生达百分之六十以上，小学生则达到百分之八十以上。党和人民政府，为青年准备了求知所必须的一切条件，教育质量和学校的物质设备正在不断改进，青年们深感生活在毛泽东时代的幸福，在学生中间，刻苦用功、努力学习，已经成为一种新的风气。
    各少数民族的文化教育事业，在党和毛泽东主席的亲切关怀下，有了巨大的发展。在反动统治时期各民族地区几乎没有中学，有的就根本没有学校。根据一九五三年一月不完全的统计，现在专为少数民族设立的高等学校已有三所，共有学生二千三百余人，民族学院八所，学生四千余人，中等学校已有一百六十二所，学生八万九千四百余人，小学生已达一百四十七万四千余人。内蒙古自治区解放前全区文盲占总人口的百分之九十以上，现在百分之八十以上的劳动人民的子弟都进了学校。东北朝鲜族入学儿童已达学龄儿童百分之九十二左右。伟大的祖国在毛泽东主席领导下是各民族友爱合作的大家庭。少数民族青年正在毛泽东主席的光辉的旗帜下发育成长，并和各族人民一起创造着自己祖国的光辉未来。
    全国各民族、各界、各阶层青年在祖国的各个战线上都起了积极的作用。如各少数民族青年在推行民族区域自治，加强民族团结及其他工作中，均起着积极作用，并出现了不少模范事例。如西康德格县藏族女青年曲梅巴贞，自德格解放后曾带了自己的牛马参加支援进藏部队的运输工作，爱护人民的物资如同自己的一样，被评为运输模范。再如，甘肃夏河牧区藏族青年马九加，因冒生命危险调解部落纠纷，被评为“团结英雄”，又如劳动模范蒙族女青年萨仁，她是著名的梁军女拖拉机队里优秀的拖拉机手，去年创造了一小时播种四·六三公顷的全国新记录。工商界许多青年，带头遵守政府法令，和配合着国营企业进行生产。城市社会青年在各种运动中成为街道党、政基层组织的助手之一。宗教界许多青年在爱国运动中，和披着宗教外衣的帝国主义者进行着长期和复杂的斗争。
    由于青年们的以上这些努力和贡献，就提高了自己的社会和政治地位。
    我们的人民政府十分重视青年在国家政治活动中的积极作用，国家的各个机关中都吸收了大量的青年干部。在全国人民政治协商会议中，青年团体的代表共三十一人。在地方各界人民代表会议中，青年代表也占有相当的比数。据北京、上海等十二市的统计，青年团体代表占各界人民代表会议代表总数的百分之七左右。据今年三月一日公布的“中华人民共和国全国人民代表大会及地方各级人民代表大会选举法”第四条的规定，估计全国将有六千万以上年满十八岁到二十五岁的青年获得选举和被选举权。中国青年深刻体验到自己是国家的主人，感到身为伟大的中国的公民的光荣和骄傲。因此，更努力学习，更积极工作，把自己一切力量贡献给国家，把全国人民建设事业更加推向前进，就成了中国青年对祖国的重大责任和神圣义务。
    中国青年关心扩大与巩固世界青年的团结，忠实于保卫世界和平的事业。我们支持世界民主青年联盟的各种活动，并与各国青年团体保持密切的联系。我们的青年代表出席了各种国际青年会议，到过二十个国家进行访问。我们接待过两个国际青年组织及四十五个国家的青年代表到中国参观访问。通过这些国际活动，中国青年受到国际主义教育，得到了很大的鼓舞，加强了与各国青年的友谊，并表达了中国青年建设幸福生活和保卫和平的决心和力量。
    中华全国民主青年联合总会是全国青年的共同组织，从第一次全国青年代表大会以来，全国青联的组织已大大地发展了。目前中华全国民主青年联合总会的组织包括四个全国性的团体（中国新民主主义青年团、中华全国学生联合会、中华基督教青年协会及中华基督教女青年协会）及一百零八个省市民主青年联合会。通过青年代表大会、代表会议及其他形式，各级青年联合会与广大青年建立了联系，成为党和政府倾听广大青年群众的意见和要求，传达政策法令和动员各方面青年投入各项运动的一个纽带。
    代表同志们，四年以来，中国青年运动已有了重要的成就，无论在规模上和内容上，都是中国青年运动历史上任何时期所不能比拟的。我们所以能够获得上述的成就，是和我们的人民民主的社会制度和国家制度分不开的；是和全国人民各项工作四年来的伟大成就分不开的；特别是和中国共产党及我们伟大的领袖毛泽东主席的英明领导分不开的，是他使青年的热情和智慧有了正确发挥的可能，是他使祖国广大青年的力量汇集团结在一起，像巨流似的朝着胜利前进。
    四年来的中国青年运动虽有了重大的发展，但是，我们决不能因此自满。在我们的工作中还存在着严重的缺点，如我们对生产建设战线上的青年工作，还未有计划地总结其经验教训，给予积极的和具体的指导；特别是还有某些青年组织和青年干部还缺少工农业生产知识而又未重视这方面的工作，钻不进去，使我们在迎接祖国建设时期中产生了新的困难。其次，我们的团结面还不够广泛，过去我们不仅在少数民族青年、工商界青年、城市社会青年和宗教青年中，工作做得不够，就在发动得比较广泛的工、农和知识分子青年群众中，青年运动的发动面也还是不够广的，有些地区的青年工作还只限于少数积极分子的圈子里，先进青年常有突出冒进的情绪，活动形式也不够丰富多样。我们还不善于带动一般的青年群众共同前进。以上这些缺点，是我们在今后工作中必须加以克服的。
    经历过各种严重考验的中国青年，是坚强的有勇气的，在胜利的毛泽东旗帜之下，我们准备克服前进道上的任何困难，完成毛泽东主席交给我们的一切任务。
    代表同志们！在毛泽东主席和中国共产党的英明领导下，全国人民胜利地完成了经济恢复时期的任务，现在我们的国家已经进入建设时期了。
    在建设时期，民主青联最基本的任务，就是在毛泽东主席和中国共产党的领导下，联系并教育青年群众，不断地提高青年群众的觉悟程度和组织程度，以中国新民主主义青年团为核心，团结各阶层的民主青年，和全国人民在一起，积极地完成国家建设计划，为逐步实现国家的工业化与逐步过渡到社会主义社会而斗争。
    今年我们的国家已经开始实行第一个五年计划，这个计划的完成和超额完成，要求全国人民从各方面进行巨大的努力，同时也要求全国的民主青年具有坚定不移、生气勃勃、不怕困难的精神，来响应祖国的召唤，并从不同的岗位上给国家贡献自己的力量，完成祖国给予自己的任务。
    中国人民解放军和中国人民志愿军的青年，要努力学习苏联先进的军事科学和技术，学习政治和文化，增强体质，建设现代化的国防军，为巩固国防，为保卫祖国而奋斗。
    青年工人要积极参加爱国劳动竞赛，挖掘生产潜力，提高劳动生产率，提高产品质量，节约原料，降低成本，为完成并超额完成生产计划而努力。青年工人要努力学习政治，要树立正确的劳动态度，模范地遵守劳动纪律，严格执行操作规程与保安制度；要虚心向成年工人学习，向先进生产者学习，学习先进的工作方法，学习苏联的先进经验。
    农村中的男女青年要积极参加农业生产，根据自愿和互利的原则，有步骤地发展建立在农民私有财产基础上的互助合作组织，同时保护单干户；青年农民应当善于与有经验的成年农民合作，并向他们学习，改进工作技术，深耕细作，加工施肥，改良种子，防止病虫害，兴修水利，防水防旱，护林造林，开展爱国增产运动，提高单位面积产量，为完成和超过农业增产计划而奋斗。
    国家贸易机关和合作社中的青年工作者，要认真学习政府的贸易合作政策，努力钻研业务，经常了解国家和人民的需要，与全体贸易合作工作人员团结一致，完成国家收购和销售计划，贯彻经济核算制，降低商品流转费用，加速资金周转，努力开展城乡物资交流，更好地为工农业生产服务，为消费者和社员们服务。
    国家机关和一切人民团体的青年工作人员，要努力学习马克思列宁主义，提高自己的理论政策和业务水平，遵守国家纪律，积极工作，不断提高工作效率，巩固人民民主专政，推行廉洁的、朴素的、联系人民群众的革命工作作风，全心全意地实事求是地为人民群众的利益服务。
    各民族中的青年们应当在加强全民族团结的事业中，起模范的带头作用，为共同反对帝国主义侵略，建设独立、统一、繁荣的伟大祖国而奋斗；推行民族区域自治，为发展少数民族地区的经济、文化和医药卫生工作，逐步改善各民族人民的生活而努力。
    男女青年学生应当努力学习科学知识，提高政治水平，锻炼身体，准备为祖国服务。
    青年教育工作者应当努力学习苏联教育工作的先进经验，用先进的科学知识、革命思想和爱国主义与国际主义相结合的精神去教育青年和儿童，普及和提高文化教育事业，为国家造就更多的人材。
    青年科学技术人员要密切联系工农群众，努力学习苏联先进的科学技术，吸收工农群众的实际经验，积极帮助青年工人、农民提高生产技能，努力进行科学研究和技术改进工作，为不断地提高自己的科学技术水平和帮助国家培养大批新型的技术人员而努力。
    青年文学和艺术工作者应努力学习马克思列宁主义的文学艺术理论，遵循毛主席所指出的为工农兵服务的方向，在深入群众的实际生活和斗争中进行体验，提高艺术修养，为表现在我国人民和青年中间涌现出来的英雄的形象，创造人民与青年所喜爱的，具有思想性和艺术性的更多的作品而努力。
    青年体育工作者要在全国青年中推广群众性的体育运动，为增强人民的体质而斗争。
    青年医药卫生、保育保健工作者要努力学习苏联先进医药卫生科学与技术，注意妇婴保健工作，使年幼的一代更活泼健壮地成长起来；深入农村为群众治疗疾病，继续参加爱国卫生运动，为增进人民健康而努力。
    青年工商业者，应当在人民政府和国营经济的领导下，遵循共同纲领的轨道，推动全体工商业家，防止重犯“五毒”的非法行为，努力经营有利于国计民生的经济事业。
    青年的宗教信徒们应当发扬爱国精神，积极参加反对帝国主义侵略和保卫和平的斗争。
    全国青年必须学习和宣传“中华人民共和国全国人民代表大会及地方各级人民代表大会选举法”，并积极参加全国的选举运动。民主青年联合会和它的各级组织应该动员全体青年积极支持为祖国和人民忠诚服务的、人民认为满意的和必要的人作为人民的代表，同时选出与青年群众保持密切联系，熟悉和关心人民利益和青年切身要求，并为青年所热烈支持的人物作为青年代表去参加各级人民代表大会。我们必须经过全国的选举运动，进一步地来提高全国青年的政治积极性，并发挥青年在国家政治建设中的作用。
    这些就是国家建设时期全国各个方面的青年的具体任务。
    为着完成国家建设时期民主青联的基本任务和上述具体任务，我们必须在中国青年运动现有成绩的基础上，充分运用过去四年来所获得的经验，从以下几个方面来改进我们的工作。
    第一、就是必须在中国共产党的领导下，使中国的青年运动成为全国人民建设事业整体中的一个组成部分，把动员青年完成国家建设时期的上述任务与适当地照顾青年的特殊利益切身要求密切地结合起来。四年来的经验证明，中国青年运动之所以有发展，正是由于一方面防止了并纠正了片面强调青年特殊利益而不顾国家整体利益的错误倾向，另一方面又同时反对了对青年的切身要求漠不关心的官僚主义。因此，今后的工作中，我们必须注意在动员青年完成国家的中心任务时，适当地而不是孤立地满足青年的切身要求，以便使青年的积极性和创造性能够得到更大的发挥，使青年工作更加充满生气，更加广泛地动员青年群众，加强组织，巩固团结，为完成国家给予青年的任务而奋斗。
    第二、必须加强青年的学习。青年的特点是热情积极，可是缺乏知识和经验。因此，必须在全体青年面前强调学习的任务。中国的青年必须记住斯大林同志的教导：“要建设，就必须有知识，就必须掌握科学。而要有知识，就必须学习”，深刻认识学习是中国青年在国家建设时期一个突出的任务，而进行虚心的勤恳的学习。青年应当学习文化，学习科学知识，学习生产知识，学习业务技能；同时也应当学习毛泽东同志的著作，学习爱国主义和国际主义的精神，学习革命的理论，学习中国共产党和人民政府的政策。中国青年必须经过这些学习，既使自己能具有一技之长、专门的科学知识和业务技能，以便能在不同的岗位上给国家建设事业提供切实有效的贡献；又使自己具有高度的政治觉悟、良好的道德品质，忠于祖国、忠于人民、忠于毛泽东主席的理想和事业，能够密切联系群众，全心全意地为人民群众的利益服务。这就是说，必须经过这些学习，使中国青年能把他们在各个不同岗位上的日常工作与国家建设事业的伟大前途——逐步实现国家的工业化与逐步地过渡到社会主义社会——联系起来，使他们能在他们的日常工作中努力实现这个前途；使中国青年成为毛泽东的好学生，成为新中国优秀的保卫者和建设者，始终信任中国共产党，并始终保证在中国共产党的领导下为全国人民和全国青年的美好将来而奋斗到底。因此各级青年团体应积极协助有关方面认真组织青年的学习，随时检查和总结学习的成绩和经验，以鼓舞青年的前进信心。同时在青年中还要普遍展开体育运动和文娱活动，使每一个青年懂得建设国防发展生产以及参加各种工作必须具有健康的体格和愉快的精神，以更好地服务于国家的建设事业。
    第三、必须扩大和加强青年的团结，并建立广泛的青年统一战线工作。对国内来说，中华全国民主青年联合总会是全国民主青年统一战线的组织，参加这一组织的是全国的各个青年团体和省市各级民主青联的组织。中国革命的历史经验证明，广大青年知识分子和学生群众是中国青年运动一个重要组成部分，但他们必须与工农群众相结合，才能形成一支坚强的力量。这是毛泽东主席给我们的伟大指示。中国青年广泛的统一战线是以工农劳动青年和革命知识青年为基础的，但在充分发动广大工农青年和革命知识青年的基础上，还必须足够地重视和展开对少数民族、民族资产阶级、城市小资产阶级、宗教界及技术人员中的青年的团结，才能把最大多数的青年组织起来，参加国家建设。由于工厂、农村、机关、学校、部队的青年均已参加各该方面的组织，不另建立民主青联的组织，又由于少数民族、民族资产阶级、城市小资产阶级、宗教界和技术人员中的青年工作是很差的，因此今后为着巩固和扩大各界青年的团结，各地民主青联应以这些青年作为自己工作的主要对象，而加强这些青年中的工作。民主青联特别应该加强少数民族地区的青年工作，努力增进各民族青年的联系，增加各民族青年相互间的了解，推动各民族青年在加强和巩固全国民族团结的事业中，起模范的带头作用。各省和各大行政区的民主青联的组织，应把帮助和具体指导各民族地区民主青联的工作，作为自己的首要任务。对国际来说，中华全国民主青年联合总会，又是世界民主青年统一战线组织的一部分，因此，我们应当加强国际青年工作，团结在世界民主青联的旗帜之下，积极参加国际青年和平民主运动，努力学习苏联的青年工作经验，有计划地介绍中国青年的幸福生活和斗争经验，更进一步地加强与世界各国青年的联系和团结，为争取世界持久和平而努力奋斗。
    第四、必须改进青年工作的工作方法。代表同志们！我们的任务是更加艰巨了，中华全国民主青年联合总会的各级组织及一切青年工作者，必须在现有工作基础上，努力改进我们的工作方法和思想作风，面向生产、面向广大群众，把广大青年更进一步地团结起来，为实现国家的建设计划而斗争。
    为此目的，省市民主青年联合会必须适应青年的特点，采取代表会议及其他组织形式，经常反映青年的要求，以推动青年进行工作和学习。同时，民主青联必须根据不同的情况，采取青年们所喜爱的各种方式，去组织青年的活动，如协助政府办好补习学校，协助有关方面举办体育、文娱活动，以及组织青年参加读报组，读书会，举行讲演、座谈，组织参观旅行等，通过各种形象化的活动，来达到教育青年的目的，民主青联必须在中国共产党各级组织及各级人民政府的密切领导和中国新民主主义青年团的大力支持下，取得各有关方面的协助和指导，经常反映情况，提出问题，引起各方面及时注意和解决青年中的问题。我们必须学会和善于运用毛主席所教导我们的领导方法，即领导与群众相结合、一般号召与具体指导相结合的方法，来进行青年运动的领导工作，并在日常工作中注意展开批评和自我批评，特别是自下而上的批评，更进一步地密切联系群众，克服领导上的官僚主义。
    全体代表同志们！
    毛泽东主席在一九五○年的中国人民政治协商会议第一届全国委员会第二次会议的闭幕词中指示我们：“我们的国家就是这样地稳步前进，经过战争，经过新民主主义的改革，而在将来，在国家经济事业和文化事业大为兴盛了以后，在各种条件具备了以后，在全国人民考虑成熟并在大家同意了以后，就可以从容地和妥善地走进社会主义的新时期。
    “在这个远大目标上，在国外，我们必须坚固地团结苏联、各新民主国家及全世界一切和平民主力量，对此不可有丝毫的游移和动摇。在国内，我们必须团结各民族、各民主阶级、各民主党派、各人民团体及一切爱国民主人士，必须巩固我们这个已经建立的伟大的有威信的革命统一战线。不论什么人，凡对于这个革命统一战线的巩固工作有所贡献者，我们就欢迎他，他就是正确的；凡对于这个革命统一战线的巩固工作有所损害者，我们就反对他，他就是错误的。”
    同志们，毛泽东主席这个光辉指示，像灯塔一样，照耀着我们前进的道路。为着完成建设祖国的神圣任务，为着坚决地保卫我们亲爱的伟大的祖国，让我们英勇地高举着毛泽东的光荣旗帜前进吧！
    在毛泽东的胜利旗帜下团结起来！
    我们伟大的祖国万岁！
    我们伟大的中国人民的领袖和青年的导师——毛泽东主席万岁！
