Xinhua News Agency, June 6th. The All-China Federation of Trade Unions sent a telegram of congratulations to the 29th Congress of the French General Confederation of Labor, scheduled to be held in Paris on the 7th. The telegram reads as follows:
To the 29th Congress of the French General Confederation of Labor:

On the occasion of the 29th Congress of the French General Confederation of Labor, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions extends warm congratulations and fraternal greetings to the French working class and the delegates to the Congress. The French government, following the US imperialists in expanding its military and preparing for war, and especially due to its criminal war in Vietnam, has greatly damaged the French national economy and worsened the people's lives. The French General Confederation of Labor has consistently represented the interests of the French working class and people, and has continuously enhanced its prestige in the struggle. At the same time, the democratic forces of the French working class and people are also constantly growing. The Chinese working class feels infinitely encouraged by every achievement of the French working brothers and is willing to give all possible support. We congratulate you on the convening of your 29th Congress and wish you new victories in the struggle to unite all French workers to improve living conditions, defend trade union rights, and defend world peace and the democratic rights of the people.

Long live the friendship and solidarity between the working classes of China and France!
Long live the solidarity of the working class of the world!

         All-China Federation of Trade Unions
    June 6, 1953
