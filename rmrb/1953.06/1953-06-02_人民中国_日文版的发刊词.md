The publication of the Japanese edition of "People's China" is intended to convey to readers who understand Japanese, mainly the Japanese people, the true situation of China's national construction undertakings today—in politics, economy, culture, education, social activities, and other aspects—so that readers can clearly, quickly, and continuously obtain a relatively comprehensive understanding by following the development process. This is of great necessity in promoting the friendship between the Chinese and Japanese people and in maintaining peace in the Far East and world peace.

We are a country that implements a policy of peace. Article 54 of our "Common Program" clearly stipulates: "Uphold lasting international peace and friendly cooperation among the peoples of all countries, and oppose the imperialist policies of aggression and war." Therefore, our news policy is to "protect the freedom to report true news, and prohibit the use of news to engage in slander, damage the interests of the state and the people, and incite world war." (Article 49 of the "Common Program")

This publication, like our entire Chinese news and publishing industry, is compiled in accordance with our fundamental law. We will report the true situation of the people's democratic China and the sincere wishes and practical actions of the Chinese people in loving and defending peace truthfully and pragmatically, in order to promote people's friendship, strengthen international peace, and resolutely oppose aggressive war.

We deeply understand that friendly cooperation between the peoples of all countries is the solid foundation for maintaining lasting international peace. But if the peoples of all countries are to be able to cooperate in a friendly manner, we must first do our best to promote mutual understanding. Only with mutual understanding can there be mutual respect, mutual learning, mutual assistance, and the attainment of true friendly cooperation.

Here lies a watershed between those who implement a policy of peace and those who implement a policy of aggression. Countries that implement a policy of aggression, in order to enslave the people of other countries, take the opposite direction. They have no intention of carrying out mutual understanding at all. Their methods are blockade, deception, and distortion, so as to deceive and incite unwarranted national hatred, thereby leading to war.

We are opposed to the policy of aggressive war, so we must ensure the authenticity of our news reports in order to break the blockade, deception, and distortion of war instigators.

The Chinese and Japanese people have close relations due to their long-term historical interactions and geographical proximity. Japan still uses Chinese characters as one of the components of the Japanese writing system. The lifestyle and sentiments of the Japanese people are also traditionally similar to those of the Chinese people. On this basis, mutual understanding between the two peoples should be relatively easy. However, it is regrettable that the ruling class in Japan has not awakened from its past policy of aggressive war, and is controlled by the occupying countries that implement a policy of aggressive war, and therefore is deliberately hostile to the Chinese people, and tries its best to conceal and distort the truth about China. If such a situation is allowed to continue, it will undoubtedly lead to a very unfortunate outcome.

The best relationship between people is what we call "soulmate." This word is also used in Japan. We also hope that the relationship between countries can reach the level of "soulmate." We know that there is a difference between the Japanese people and the Japanese ruling class. The Japanese people are eager to understand the true situation in China, and want to have in-depth contact with us in trade and culture. This demand is, in fact, a powerful encouragement for the publication of this edition.

Our publication is called "People's China"—such a name with rich connotations is worth our deep appreciation.

We Chinese people attach great importance to our inherent good and valuable heritage, but today's China is completely different from China in any previous era. In today's China, the people have become the real masters. Our people's democratic regime, based on the worker-peasant alliance, is led by the working class. Patriotic intellectuals and national capitalists are doing their best to serve national construction. We are vigorously developing our industrial and agricultural production in order to gradually improve the material and cultural living standards of the people. In the past three years, we have achieved remarkable achievements in social reform, national construction, and the cause of defending peace.

We love our motherland and our state system. We do not want to hide our long-term goal, which is to gradually complete the construction of socialism and realize a communist society. We feel honored to have the wise leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong and the Communist Party of China, and we feel encouraged by the friendly mutual assistance of the democratic peace camp led by the Soviet Union. But we also firmly believe that countries with different systems can coexist peacefully, as long as we can understand each other, respect each other, and not interfere in each other's internal affairs. We will never interfere in other people's internal affairs, but we will never want to be interfered with by others. As long as we are on the basis of equality and mutual benefit, non-interference, we can carry out trade and exchange cultural experiences, what reason is there to have to resort to war?

Those who embrace a policy of aggressive war are completely on the wrong path, and we hope they can turn back as soon as possible. Wars launched with aggressive intent have never been successful in human history. Even if some achieve temporary success, the result will inevitably be extremely heavy losses. There is no need to look too far for examples. Please recall what happened to militarist old Japan after launching a long-term war of aggression against China and the Pacific War.

It may be very difficult to make those who have gone the wrong way consciously turn back. The important thing is not to let more people follow them down the wrong path. How can this be done? It is not difficult to say. Since the main reliance of war instigators is deception, if we are not deceived and constantly expose their deception, their war policy will inevitably go bankrupt.

In order to maintain peace in the Far East and the world, and to increase the happiness of the Chinese and Japanese people, we are willing to report more of our true situation, and we also want the Japanese people to understand our true situation more.

    “人民中国”日文版的发刊词
    郭沫若
    “人民中国”日文版的刊行，是准备对通晓日本文的读者，主要是日本人民，传达今日中国的国家建设事业—政治、经济、文化、教育、社会活动等各方面的真实情况，使读者能够明确地、迅速地、不断地、追随着发展过程而获得比较全面的了解。这在促进中日两国人民的友谊上、在维护远东和平与世界和平上，是大有必要的。
    我们是执行和平政策的国家，我们的“共同纲领”第五十四条有明确的规定：“拥护国际的持久和平和各国人民间的友好合作，反对帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策”。因而我们的新闻政策也就是“保护报道真实新闻的自由。禁止利用新闻以进行诽谤，破坏国家人民的利益和煽动世界战争。”（“共同纲领”第四十九条）
    本刊和我们全中国整个的新闻出版事业一样，是遵守着我们的根本大法而进行编纂的。我们要实事求是地报道人民民主的中国的真实情况和中国人民爱好和平与保卫和平事业的诚恳愿望和实际行动，用以促进人民友谊、加强国际和平，而坚决地反对侵略战争。
    我们深切地了解：各国人民之间的友好合作是维护国际持久和平的坚实基础。但要各国人民能够友好合作，必须首先在促进相互了解上尽我们的力量。要有相互了解，然后才有可能相互尊重、相互学习、相互协助，而达到真正友好合作的地步。
    在这儿便呈现出一个执行和平政策者与执行侵略政策者之间的分水岭。执行侵略政策的国家，为了要奴役别国人民，恰恰是采取着相反的方向。它们根本不想进行相互了解，它们的手段是封锁、蒙蔽、歪曲，这样来进行欺骗，煽动莫须有的民族仇恨，从而导引向战争。
    我们是反对侵略战争政策的，因而我们在新闻报道上必须保证报道的真实性，以击破战争挑拨者的封锁、蒙蔽和歪曲。
    中日两国人民，由于历史上的长远交往与地理上的邻接，是有着密切的关系的。日本还在使用汉字作为日本文字的组成部分之一。日本人民的生活方式和情调也还传统地和中国人民相似。在这样的基础之上，两国人民的相互了解，应该是比较容易进行的。然而遗憾的是：日本的统治阶层并没有从以往的侵略战争政策中觉醒过来，而又受着执行侵略战争政策的占领国家的控制，因而存心与中国人民为敌，而对于中国的真相尽力加以蒙蔽和歪曲。如果听任这样的情况继续下去，无疑是会达到很不幸的结局的。
    人与人之间的至好，我们叫做“知己”。这个语汇，日本也在使用。国与国之间的关系，我们也希望能够做到“知己”的程度。我们知道：日本人民和日本的统治阶层是有区别的。日本人民渴望着想了解中国的真实情况，无论在贸易上、文化上都想和我们作深入的接触。这种要求，事实上也就是对于本版的刊行一个有力的鼓舞。
    我们的刊物叫“人民中国”——这样一个内涵丰富的名称，是值得我们深深体会的。
    我们中国人民十分重视我们所固有的很多优良的宝贵遗产，但我们今天的中国是完全不同于以往任何时代的中国了。在我们今天的中国是人民已经做了真正的主人。我们的以工农联盟为基础的人民民主政权，是工人阶级在领导。爱国的知识分子和民族资本家都尽力地在为国家建设服务。我们在大力发展我们的工农业生产，以逐步提高人民的物质生活与文化生活的水平。三年来，我们在社会改革方面、国家建设方面、保卫和平事业方面，都获得了惊人的成就。
    我们热爱我们的祖国，热爱我们的国家制度。我们丝毫也不想隐讳我们的远大的目标，便是逐步完成社会主义的建设而实现共产主义的社会。我们以有毛泽东主席和中国共产党的英明领导而感受着光荣，以有以苏联为首的民主和平阵营的友好互助而感受着鼓舞。但我们同时也坚决地相信：不同制度的国家是可以和平共处的，只要我们能够相互了解、相互尊重、不干涉别人内政。我们是决不干涉别人内政的，但也决不愿受别人干涉。只要我们在平等互利的基础之上，互不干涉，尽可以进行通商贸易，交流文化经验，有什么理由有诉诸战争的必要呢？
    怀抱着侵略战争政策的人是完全走错了路，我们希望他们能够赶快回头。抱着侵略的目的而进行的战争，在人类历史上从来没有过成功的例子。即使有的获得一时的成功，而其结果必然遭受极其惨重的失败。取例不必太远，请回忆一下军国主义的旧日本，在发动了长期的侵华战争与太平洋战争之后，结果是怎样了？
    要使走错了路的人自觉的走回头路，恐怕是很困难的事。要紧的应该是不要让更多的人跟着他们走错路。这要怎样才可以办到呢？说来也并不困难。战争挑拨者们主要的凭借既然是欺骗，我们如果不受欺骗，并经常揭露他们的欺骗，他们的战争政策结果也就必然破产了。
    为了维护远东与世界的和平，为了增进中日两国人民的幸福，我们愿意多多报道我们的真相，也愿意日本人民多多了解我们的真相。
