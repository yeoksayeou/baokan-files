    Wuhan City Pays Attention to Correcting Chaotic Phenomena in Street Work
    At an administrative meeting held in April this year, the Wuhan Municipal People's Government focused on studying and discussing the problem of overcoming chaotic phenomena in street work, and decided that street work should be uniformly arranged by the Municipal Government. In the two months since then, street work has improved significantly, and the previous chaotic phenomena have been basically overcome.
    In the past, the chaotic situation in street work in Wuhan was quite serious. This was mainly because many organs and units at the municipal and district levels emphasized their own work, neglecting the actual burden capacity of street cadres, and assigned many tasks downwards without limit, leaving street cadres and street activists struggling to cope. In February and March of this year, each street generally accepted about thirty-eight or nine tasks assigned by various municipal and district organs each month. The Da Cheng Street in Wuchang District even reached as many as forty-three tasks. Too many tasks and too much urgency often caused serious consequences in the streets. In January this year, the Civil Affairs Section of the Jiang'an District required each street in the district to complete four types of relief work within three days: social relief, relief for families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers, relief for poor infants, and long-term relief. Each type of relief had to go through three steps: evaluation, review, and distribution. When assigning the tasks, the person in charge of the Civil Affairs Section asked the civil affairs cadres to be fully responsible, and the civil affairs cadres asked the residents' group leaders to be fully responsible. Some street cadres, fearing criticism for failing to complete the tasks, falsely reported achievements. For example, during the Patriotic Health Campaign month, one street killed fifty rats but reported two hundred, and killed one jin of flies but reported ten jin.
    Due to the large number of tasks, street cadres and activists also attended many meetings and held many concurrent positions. The cultural and educational, health, and women's affairs cadres of Jiaotong Street attended more than forty-two meetings each month. The street held more than one hundred meetings, large and small, each month, keeping cadres and activists busy all day long. Wu Huizhen, a women's activist, held twelve positions concurrently and could not get rest before or after childbirth. Zhou Yuzhen, the head of the public security group, had her busiest day in January this year. From eight o'clock in the morning to eleven o'clock in the evening, she attended five meetings in a row, making it impossible to take care of housework and even having no time to eat. Various units also often pulled activists to complete tasks, leaving activists in a dilemma. Disputes often arose between units because of this. For example, the Shimaitou Police Station and the Laoguanmiao Police Station in Qiaokou District often had disputes with the street government over the use of activists.
    The large number of tasks and heavy workload made the ideological and emotional state of street cadres and activists very chaotic. Some fell ill from exhaustion, and some were not at ease with their work.
    In view of the above situation, the Wuhan Municipal People's Government, on the one hand, organized inspection teams to conduct in-depth inspections to find out the chaotic situation in street work; on the other hand, it strictly controlled the work submitted to the streets by the municipal and district-level organs. All work was comprehensively reviewed by the Municipal Government, sorted by importance and urgency, and uniformly arranged. Since April, street work in Wuhan has improved significantly, mainly reflected in:
    The phenomenon of "multiple" leadership has been fundamentally resolved. The phenomenon of "everyone is a superior, everything is a center" has been eliminated. After the Municipal Government issues instructions for street work each month, each district makes specific arrangements based on the actual situation of the street, and street cadres can also grasp the priority of the work, so they know what to do.
    After the workload was reduced, the past busy and chaotic phenomena and the work style of not going deep into the work have been corrected. Democratic Street and Xida Street in Wuchang District, and Hualou Street and Jiaotong Street in Jianghan District, etc., all take half a day each week to concentrate cadres to study the work. Responsible cadres in Qiaokou and Wuchang districts also often go to the streets to help with work and understand the situation. Now, the vast majority of streets in the city have established learning, life, and work systems. The number of meetings has also been greatly reduced, and activists and residents are very happy. They said: "The district government has unloaded a big burden for us, and we can concentrate on production in the future."
    The problems that still exist in street work in Wuhan are: the leading organs of some districts lack universal and in-depth inspection of street work; some municipal-level organs cannot contact the district government in a timely manner after uniformly arranging work, which makes it difficult for the district to arrange work. The control of meetings in some districts and streets is not strict enough. Therefore, the number of meetings has gradually increased in May. These should be further noted and improved.

### 武汉市注意纠正街道工作中的混乱现象

    武汉市注意纠正街道工作中的混乱现象
    武汉市人民政府在今年四月举行的行政会议上着重研究和讨论了克服街道工作中的混乱现象的问题，决定街道工作由市府统一布置。两月多来，街道工作有了显著改进，过去的混乱现象基本克服了。
    过去武汉市街道工作中的混乱情况是相当严重的。这主要是由于市、区级许多机关单位强调本身工作，忽视街道干部的实际负担能力，将许多工作无限制地往下布置，使街道干部和街道积极分子穷于应付。今年二、三月份，各街道每月所接受的市、区各机关布置的工作，一般都在三十八、九项左右。武昌区大城街竟达四十三项之多。任务过多过急，在街道中常常造成严重恶果。江岸区民政科在今年元月间要该区各街道在三天内完成社会救济、烈军属救济、贫婴救济、长期救济等四种救济工作，每种救济都要经过评议、审查、发放三个步骤。交代任务时，民政科负责人要民政干事完全负责，民政干事又要居民小组长完全负责。有的街道干部怕完不成任务要受批评，便虚报成绩。如在爱国卫生突击月中，有的街打了五十只老鼠，却报了二百只，打了一斤苍蝇，却报了十斤。
    由于任务繁多，街道干部和积极分子参加的会议和兼职也多。交通街的文教、卫生、妇女干事，每人每月开会都在四十二次以上。全街大小会每月竟达一百多次，使干部和积极分子成天忙碌。妇女积极分子吴慧珍身兼十二职，产前产后都得不到休息。治安组长周玉珍在今年元月间工作最忙的一天，从早晨八点到晚上十一点，连续开了五个会，不但家务无法料理，甚至连饭都没时间吃。各单位还经常互相拉积极分子来完成任务，弄得积极分子左右为难。单位与单位之间也常因此而发生纠纷。如礄口区石码头派出所和老关庙派出所经常在使用积极分子上与街政府发生争执。
    任务多、工作重，使街道干部和积极分子的思想情绪非常混乱。有的累病了，有的不安心工作。
    根据上述情况，武汉市人民政府一面组织检察组深入检查，摸清街道工作中的混乱情况；一面对市、区两级机关交到街道去的工作作了严格控制，所有工作均由市府全面审查，分别轻重缓急，统一布置。自四月份以来，武汉市街道工作有了显著改进，主要表现在：
    领导“多头”的现象已从根本上得到解决。过去“人人是上级，件件是中心”的现象已经消除。每月街道工作由市府发出指示后，各区都根据街道实际情况进行具体的安排，街道干部也能掌握工作的主次轻重，做到心中有数。
    工作任务减少后，过去的忙乱现象和工作不深入的作风已得到纠正。武昌区的民主街、西大街，江汉区的花楼街、交通街等每星期都抽出半天时间集中干部研究工作。礄口、武昌等区的负责干部也经常到街道帮助工作，了解情况。现在全市绝大部分的街道都建立了学习、生活和工作制度。开会的次数也大大减少，积极分子和居民都非常高兴。他们说：“区政府给我们卸了大包袱，往后可以安心生产了。”
    现在武汉市街道工作中还存在的问题是：还有一些区的领导机关对街道工作缺乏普遍深入的检查；一些市级机关在统一布置工作后，不能及时与区政府联系，使区布置工作时发生困难。部分区、街对会议控制还不够严格。因此，五月份会议又渐增多。这些都应进一步注意和改进。（张嵩行）
