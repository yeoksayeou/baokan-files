    Binhai Farm Promptly Transplants and Replenishes Seedlings to Ensure Full Corn Stands, Promoting Farmers' Production
    Yuan Deshan, Binhai County Farm, Jiangsu Province, writes: Our Binhai County Farm planted 45 mu of "Big Donkey Tooth" corn this year. Due to our failure to properly control the depth of the seeds during planting, and the planting area experiencing a prolonged drought, the corn germination rate was very low. Furthermore, the young seedlings were damaged by cutworms, resulting in a serious lack of seedlings. In order to ensure a good harvest, all employees of the farm, after careful study and discussion, immediately carried out replanting and took advantage of the favorable opportunity after the rain to transplant seedlings. Through the efforts of all cadres and workers, more than 620 corn plants were transplanted from densely populated areas to areas lacking seedlings, finally ensuring full stands. Now the replanted corn seedlings have emerged to a height of five inches, and the transplanted corn seedlings are also growing vigorously.

    The farmers around the farm originally thought that transplanting and replanting corn seedlings was useless. Now, seeing that the seedlings replanted and transplanted by the farm are growing well, they have also carried out transplanting and replanting in their own fields where seedlings are lacking. They said, "The farm has experience in production, and the transplanted seedlings all survived. In the future, we must learn production experience from the farm."

    滨海农场及时移苗补种保证玉米全苗推动农民生产
    江苏省滨海县农场袁德山来信：我们滨海县农场今年播种“大驴牙”玉米四十五亩。由于播种时未能很好掌握种子入土深度，播种区又久旱缺雨，玉米发芽率很低。加以幼苗出后遭到地老虎为害，缺苗情况很严重。全场员工为了确保丰收，经过认真研究讨论，立即进行补种，并利用雨后有利时机进行移植。经全体干部和工人的努力，从厚棵地方移植六百二十多棵到缺苗处，终于保证全苗。现在补种的玉米幼苗已出土五寸高，移植的玉米苗也生长得很茂盛。
    农场周围农民，原来认为玉米移苗、补种没有用，现在看到农场补种和移植的苗长得很好，田里缺苗的也都进行移苗、补种了。他们说：“还是农场生产有经验，移苗全活了，今后一定要向农场好好学习生产经验。”
