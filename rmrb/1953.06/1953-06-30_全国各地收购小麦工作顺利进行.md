    Since early June, following the listing of wheat in the Yangtze River basin and the southern provinces, wheat in the major wheat-producing areas of Shandong, Henan, Shaanxi, Hebei, Shanxi, and Anhui provinces has also begun to be marketed in large quantities. The wheat production in these provinces this year is roughly equal to half of China's total wheat production. After the wheat in these areas is put on the market, the national grain departments and cooperatives will begin to enter a climax in their work of procuring wheat nationwide.
    The price policies and supply work implemented by the state in its vigorous wheat procurement work this year have been welcomed by wheat-selling farmers across the country. After new wheat was put on the market in various places, not only did the phenomenon of "cheap grain hurting farmers" not occur, but the state-owned grain departments in various places actually increased the ratio of wheat to rice prices. Each hundred catties of wheat can roughly be exchanged for more than seventy catties to more than eighty catties of rice, which is about ten catties more than last year. At the same time, the "premium price for superior quality" policy implemented in the procurement process enables farmers to sell their various qualities of wheat at reasonable prices. State-owned trading departments and cooperative systems, in conjunction with the procurement work, transport large quantities of industrial products and fertilizers, agricultural tools, etc. from major cities and small and medium-sized towns to supply the needs of farmers, so that farmers can buy the necessary means of production and living after selling their wheat. Due to these measures, coupled with the arrival of the seasonal peak season for wheat marketing, large quantities of wheat are pouring into the market from various places, and the amount on the market is increasing daily. In mid-June, the total amount on the market in Xinyang Special District, Henan Province, increased by 2.5 times compared with the same period last year, and the procurement volume of state-owned grain departments and cooperatives increased by six times compared with the same period last year; Jiangsu Province procured more than 109 million catties of various grains in the first five days of mid-June; the procurement volume in Tengxian Special District, Shandong Province, in mid-June increased by more than nine times compared with the first ten days of the month. Wheat in northern Hebei and southern Shanxi provinces has also begun to flood the market.
    This year, governments at all levels have attached great importance to the procurement work. The Central-South Administrative Committee and the People's Governments of Henan, Jiangsu, Shandong, and other provinces have sent inspection teams to various places to inspect the procurement situation. Niu Shucai, Deputy Secretary of the Anhui Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, instructed party committees at all levels to strengthen their leadership in the procurement work at the provincial procurement work conference. Grain bureaus of the People's Governments in various provinces of North China have convened special meetings to clearly explain policies and deploy procurement tasks. A more significant improvement in the procurement work in various places this year is that procedures have been appropriately simplified to suit farmers' habits; procurement stations and procurement times have been generally increased in various places, and the time for farmers to sell grain at procurement stations generally only takes ten minutes to half an hour, and at most does not exceed one hour. This has changed the past crowded situation.
    Currently, the procurement work is proceeding smoothly in various places. The procurement volume of state-owned grain departments and cooperatives in various places generally accounts for about 80% of the market volume. Many areas have already exceeded their June procurement plans, and some areas have expanded their procurement plans in a timely manner. The Southwest region expanded its plan in a timely manner after exceeding its procurement plan on June 15. The current procurement volume in Jiangxi Province has exceeded last year's procurement volume by more than 20 million catties. Anhui Province completed 129.7% of its entire month's procurement plan on the 21st. Henan Province completed 133% of its entire month's procurement plan on the 22nd. As new wheat is put on the market, farmers in various places have begun to sell old grain, and in the first half of June, all parts of the country have completed more than half of the entire month's procurement plan for rice and miscellaneous grains.

    全国各地收购小麦工作顺利进行
    自六月初以来，继长江流域和江南各省小麦上市后，各主要产麦区山东、河南、陕西、河北、山西、安徽等省的小麦也开始大量上市。今年这几个省的小麦产量大约等于我国小麦总产量的一半。这些地区的小麦上市后，国家粮食部门和合作社在全国范围内展开的收购小麦的工作就开始进入高潮。
    今年国家在大力收购小麦的工作中所实行的价格政策和展开的供应工作，受到全国售麦农民的欢迎。各地新麦上市后，不但未出现“谷贱伤农”现象，各地国营粮食部门反而把小麦和大米的比价提高了。每百斤小麦大致可换到七十多斤到八十多斤大米，比去年多十斤左右。同时，收购中实行的“优质优价”政策，使农民的各种不同质量的小麦都能卖到合理的价钱。国营贸易部门和合作社系统又结合收购工作，从各大城市及中小城镇运大批工业品和肥料、农具等供应农民的需要，使农民卖出麦子后能够买到必需的生产资料和生活资料。由于这些措施，加上小麦季节性上市旺季已到，所以，各地大批小麦源源涌入市场，上市量日有增加。六月中旬河南省信阳专区全区上市量较去年同期增加二点五倍，国营粮食部门和合作社的收购量较去年同期增加了六倍多；江苏省六月中旬前五天内收购了各种粮食一亿零九百多万斤；山东省滕县专区六月中旬较上旬的收购量增加九倍多。河北省北部和山西省南部等地小麦也开始涌入市场。
    今年各级人民政府对收购工作都很重视。中南行政委员会、河南、江苏、山东等省人民政府已派检查组到各地检查收购情况。中共安徽省委员会副书记牛树才在全省收购工作会议上，指示各级党委加强领导收购工作。华北区各省人民政府粮食厅都召开了专门会议，明确交代政策，布置收购任务。今年各地收购工作较显著的改进是，适应农民习惯，适当地简便手续；各地普遍增加收购站和收购时间，农民在收购站的售粮时间，一般只需十分钟到半小时，最多没有超过一小时的。这就改变了过去拥挤不堪的现象。
    现在，各地收购工作都很顺利。国营粮食部门和合作社在各地收购量一般都占上市量百分之八十左右。不少地区已超额完成了六月份的收购计划，有些地区并及时扩大了收购计划。西南区在六月十五日超额完成收购计划后又及时扩大了计划。江西省目前收购量已超过去年收购量二千多万斤。安徽省二十一日已完成全月收购计划百分之一百二十九点七。河南省二十二日已完成全月收购计划百分之一百三十三。随着新麦上市，各地农民开始出售陈粮，六月上半月全国各地已完成全月大米和杂粮收购计划一半以上。（据新华社讯）
