Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, May 31st: Under the influence of the strong opposition of the Japanese people to rearmament, the negotiations between the Yoshida government and the US Ambassador to Japan, Allison, on "Mutual Security Agency Aid" have been attacked by some opposition parties in the new Japanese Diet.

The left-wing Socialist Party, which increased its seats in the new Diet in the April election by opposing rearmament, issued a statement on May 13 opposing the Yoshida government's acceptance of US "Mutual Security Agency aid." The statement said: "This aid is part of the United States' policy to strengthen the Security Forces, rearm Japan, and form a Pacific alliance. Therefore, the left-wing Socialist Party firmly opposes the United States giving Japan such military aid."

Fearing the opposition of the Japanese people, Yoshida evasively said at a press conference on the 26th when answering questions about the "Mutual Security Agency aid" negotiations: "Apart from Mutual Security Agency aid, I can tell everyone that I am not currently considering increasing the number of Security Forces personnel." Yoshida's attitude of evading the question immediately drew criticism from the left-wing Socialist Party and the right-wing Socialist Party. They pointed out that Yoshida's attitude of avoiding answering the question about "Mutual Security Agency aid" directly while secretly planning rearmament is cowardly.

United Press International, Tokyo, 25th, reported worriedly: "The issue of Mutual Security Agency aid is an important issue facing the fifth Yoshida cabinet, which was formed last week. When this issue is brought up for discussion, the opposing Diet will definitely raise fierce objections."

    日本新国会各反对党
    反对吉田接受美“援”重整军备
    【新华社三十一日讯】东京消息：在日本人民强烈反对重整军备的影响之下，吉田政府正在和美国驻日大使艾利逊进行的关于“共同安全署援助”的谈判，已受到日本新国会中一些反对党的抨击。
    由于在四月大选中反对重整军备而在新国会中增加了议员席位的左派社会党，在五月十三日即曾发表声明，反对吉田政府接受美国“共同安全署的援助”。声明说：“这项援助是美国想要加强保安队和重新武装日本，并组成太平洋联盟的政策的一部分。因此，左派社会党坚决反对美国给日本以这样的军事援助。”
    由于害怕日本人民的反对，吉田二十六日在记者招待会上答复关于“共同安全署援助”的谈判问题时，遮遮掩掩地说：“除了共同安全署援助以外，我可以告诉大家，我目前并没有考虑增加保安队人员。”吉田这种闪避问题的态度，立即受到左派社会党和右派社会党的抨击。它们指出：吉田一面避不正面答复关于“共同安全署援助”的问题，一面却在秘密地策划着重整军备，这种态度是卑怯的。
    合众社东京二十五日电曾担忧地估计：“共同安全署援助的问题，是上星期成立的第五届吉田内阁面前的一个重要问题。当这个问题提出来讨论的时候，敌对的国会一定会提出激烈的反对。”
