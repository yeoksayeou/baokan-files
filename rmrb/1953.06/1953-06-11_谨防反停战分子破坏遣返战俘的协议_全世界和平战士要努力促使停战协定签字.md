Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 10th. Our special correspondent Wu Min reports: The plenary session of the delegation of both sides in the armistice negotiations adjourned this morning, waiting for the staff officers' meeting to make progress in drafting the final administrative details before reconvening. The adjournment of the delegation plenary session today marks the final stage of the twenty-three-month-long armistice negotiations before the signing of the armistice agreement. All meetings in Panmunjom have so far been held in secret. However, after the signing of the agreement on the issue of prisoners of war - "The Scope of Authority of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission" - two days ago, only administrative details remain to be resolved before the impending signing of the armistice agreement. The remaining administrative details must be resolved before the stipulated date for the signing of the armistice agreement, including the revision of the military demarcation line to conform to the current front line, and the finalization of the original text of the armistice agreement written in Korean, Chinese and English.

The long-awaited signing of the armistice agreement will mark the end of the long-delayed armistice negotiations and the beginning of a new stage, namely the implementation of the terms of the armistice agreement to ensure a stable armistice as a step towards a final peaceful settlement of the Korean issue.

It is clear from American news reports that there are links between the "go-it-alone" elements in the United States and South Korea.

Three hours after the agreement on the repatriation of prisoners of war was signed, puppet Syngman Rhee issued a statement saying that his government would oppose the agreement. He threatened to launch "demonstrations" against the agreement. The phrase "will launch a movement" clearly shows that these "demonstrations" are backed by his government.

The next day, the South Korean puppet National Assembly passed a resolution demanding the "immediate release" of Korean and Chinese prisoners of war without handing them over to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission for custody. This is a rehash of the old tune of demanding the forcible retention of prisoners of war. The resolution also nonsensically stated that it would "immediately prepare to attack the north to unify Korea."

The day before the agreement on the repatriation of prisoners of war was signed, US senators in Washington expressed disbelief that the armistice would last. McCarthy said the armistice would be a "temporary truce." Paul Douglas said: "In the event that the Korean war flares up again, the United States will inevitably consider taking tougher military steps, including the bombing of the Communist hydroelectric power stations on the Yalu River, as advocated by General MacArthur."

Despite the frantic opposition of the pro-American and South Korean anti-armistice elements, the agreement on the issue of prisoners of war was finally signed, which is a victory for the peace-loving forces of the world. However, the armistice agreement is yet to be signed, and the American and South Korean "go-it-alone" cliques are colluding to create excuses for Syngman Rhee and his puppet government to violate the prisoner of war agreement and the armistice agreement to be signed in the future.

The day before the agreement on the repatriation of prisoners of war was signed in Panmunjom, the US Far East Air Force announced that Sabre jets had bombed the "hydroelectric generators at the foot of the Shuifeng Dam" on the Yalu River.

From these obvious signs, it can be seen that the people of the world who are fighting for peace cannot relax their efforts. They must ensure that the armistice agreement is signed and that the armistice agreement is strictly enforced to ensure a stable armistice as a step towards a final peaceful settlement of the Korean issue.

### 谨防反停战分子破坏遣返战俘的协议  全世界和平战士要努力促使停战协定签字

    谨防反停战分子破坏遣返战俘的协议
    全世界和平战士要努力促使停战协定签字
    【新华社开城十日电】本社特派记者吴敏报道：停战谈判双方代表团大会今天上午休会，等到参谋人员会议在拟订最后行政细节方面获得进展而需要他们复会时再举行会议。代表团大会今天休会，标志着在停战协定签订以前，历时二十三个月的停战谈判已达最后阶段。板门店的一切会议迄今仍然在秘密中举行。但是，在两天前签订了关于战俘问题的协议——“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”——以后，即将签订的停战协定就只剩下行政细节需要解决了。遗留下的行政细节必须在规定停战协定签字日期以前予以解决，其中包括修订军事分界线以符合目前的战线，以及将朝鲜文、中文和英文三种文字写就的停战协定原文作最后定稿。
    全世界期待已久的停战协定签字后，长期拖延的停战谈判即告结束，从此开始了一个新的阶段，即履行停战协定的条款，以保证一个稳固的停战，作为最后和平解决朝鲜问题的一个步骤。
    从美国新闻报道中可以明显看出，在美国的和南朝鲜的“单独干”分子之间是有着联系的。
    在关于战俘遣返问题的协议签订后三小时，傀儡李承晚就发表谈话说，他的政府将反对这个协议。他扬言将要发动反对这个协议的“示威”。从他说“将发动运动”这句话中就可以清楚地看出，这些“示威”是由他的政府在背后撑腰的。
    第二天，南朝鲜的伪国民议会通过决议，要求“立即释放”朝中战俘而不要把他们交给中立国遣返委员会看管。这是要求强迫扣留战俘的旧调重弹。这个决议还信口开河地说要“立即准备向北进攻以统一朝鲜”。
    在关于战俘遣返问题的协议签订的前一天，华盛顿的美国参议员们表示不相信停战会持久下去。麦卡锡说，停战将是一种“暂时的休战”。保罗·道格拉斯说：“万一朝鲜战火复燃，美国势必考虑采取更为强硬的军事步骤，包括麦克阿瑟将军所主张的轰炸鸭绿江边共方水电站在内。”
    尽管美方和南朝鲜的反停战分子拼命反对，战俘问题的协议终于签字了，这是全世界和平力量的一个胜利。但是停战协定尚待签字，美国的和南朝鲜的“单独干”的集团正勾结在一起，为李承晚及其傀儡政府违反战俘问题协议和将来签订的停战协定制造借口。
    在关于战俘遣返问题的协议在板门店签字的前一天，美方的远东空军宣布，佩刀式喷气机轰炸鸭绿江上“水丰水闸脚下的水力发电机”。
    从这些明显的迹象就可以看出，全世界为和平而斗争的人们是不可以放松他们的努力的，他们务必使停战协定签字，使停战协定被严格地执行，以保证一个稳固的停战，作为最后和平解决朝鲜问题的一个步骤。
