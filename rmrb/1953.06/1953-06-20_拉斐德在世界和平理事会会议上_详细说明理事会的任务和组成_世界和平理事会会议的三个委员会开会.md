Xinhua News Agency, 19th dispatch: According to TASS, Budapest: The afternoon session of the World Peace Council on the 17th was chaired by Tikhonov. World Peace Council Secretary-General Lafaite delivered a speech on the tasks and composition of the World Peace Council.

At the beginning of the meeting, Indian scientist and member of the Federal Council, Satyendra Nath Bose, and former Vice-Minister of Foreign Affairs of Japan and current Chairman of the Japan-China Trade Promotion Conference, Kumaichi Yamamoto, spoke successively. Satyendra Nath Bose emphasized that the Indian people love peace. Kumaichi Yamamoto said that Japan cannot survive without trade with China. He expressed the hope that the People's Republic of China would eventually join the United Nations.

The next speaker was Nguyen Xuan Thuy, the representative of Vietnam, who said that the Vietnamese people have long been fighting for the principles put forward by the world peace movement. He expressed his support for the proposal on the Far East issue put forward by the Chinese representative Guo Moruo on the first day of the meeting.

Nguyen Xuan Thuy then described the struggle of the Vietnamese people and the people of Cambodia and Laos against the French colonialists supported by the United States. He said: We demand that the three countries of Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos obtain complete independence and live in a free and peaceful environment. Similarly, we hope that France will be free from any external interference. We appeal to the French people, who are demanding that the French government face up to the will of the Vietnamese, Cambodian, and Laotian peoples, as well as the French people, to demand national independence and peace. We know that our struggle will be long and arduous, but it will eventually be victorious.

Edward Dixon, a British representative and Labour Party member of the Coventry City Council who was invited to participate in the meeting, spoke. He said that he was particularly interested in the speech delivered by Ehrenburg on the 16th, especially the following two points: First, the World Peace Council welcomes any proposal related to peace, no matter who makes it; second, Ehrenburg mentioned the Anglo-Soviet Treaty of Mutual Assistance. Edward Dixon said: If the Anglo-Soviet Treaty of Mutual Assistance were strictly observed, the international situation would not be tense, but today, Britain does not respect this treaty. Our domestic peace organizations must concentrate their efforts to change this situation. The people know that the Anglo-Soviet Treaty of Mutual Assistance is an important factor in stabilizing the situation in Europe.

The next speaker was World Peace Council Secretary-General Jean Lafitte. He detailed the tasks and composition of the Council. He said that the World Peace Council was established in November 1950 at the Second World Peace Congress held in Warsaw. The purpose of the Council is to provide people of all countries with frequent opportunities for contact in the struggle for peace. From the very beginning, the World Peace Council has opened its doors to all kinds of opinions advocating peace, so it can accept representatives of various forces to participate in practical activities to defend peace. The organized peace movement believes that the emergence of the World Peace Council is an event of great historical significance.

Although the World Peace Council has not yet achieved all its goals, it has made contributions to the cause of world peace, which it is rightly proud of. Not long ago, the Council launched a movement calling for a meeting and consultation of the five major powers to conclude a peace treaty. Now some governments and some senior officials have also supported the idea of ​​holding meetings and consultations. The World Peace Council convened the World People's Peace Congress and made it a success. The main task of the conference was to ensure that the spirit of consultation triumphs over decisions based on force, which is in line with the wishes of people all over the world. And now, based on current international events, we see the prospect of easing international tensions.

This shows the correctness of the goals set by the World Peace Council. If the World Peace Council were not a true international force, if it did not have formal branches in various countries, if it were not completely free from the influence of governments, parties, and national organizations and international organizations when deciding on policies, then its initiatives and views would not have received such a wide response.

The World Peace Council has always adhered to one principle—not to make any criticism of the merits or demerits of a certain regime or a certain way of life. It does not interfere in the internal affairs of other countries, and the right to decide on domestic affairs belongs to the people of each country. It believes that the majority of people in all countries have a common desire for peace. It wants to be an instrument for expressing this desire, and it is tirelessly seeking various decisions and concrete proposals so that all people who want peace can unite together. The resolutions of the World Peace Council address all the issues, the solutions to which are extremely important for maintaining peace. These resolutions are in line with the right of the people of all countries to decide their own affairs.

The general resolutions of the World Peace Council do not hinder the initiative of various countries, and these resolutions are not intended to make everyone the same. They only emphasize the relationship between the desire for peace that the people of all countries originally have in common and the national interests of the people of all countries. As far as the mode of activity of the peace movement in various countries is concerned, it is up to the peace movement in each country to decide on the measures to be taken. The World Peace Council only proposes measures that should be taken on a world scale, which can be supported by the people of all countries without exception.

Lafitte said that I think this nature of the World Peace Council should be maintained in the future. The principles on which the policies of the World Peace Council are based should be maintained, that is, the principles starting from the following two premises:

The existing systems in the world can and should coexist peacefully; all differences between countries can be resolved peacefully through consultation.

One of the tasks of this session is to comprehensively explain the role played by the World Peace Council in the past period. This does not mean that we are the only servants of truth, or the only force striving for peace. However, we must honestly state all the achievements that should be attributed to the World Peace Council. Why do we have to do this? Because we have not completed our work, and today's victory is far from complete.

If we do not pay attention to this matter, many people will think that there are already signs that the international situation may be clarified, and everything will get better on its own: governments will reach agreements smoothly, diplomats will carry out the cause initiated by the people and make it successful, therefore, the World Peace Council and the peace movement may no longer need to exist. If such a relaxation of vigilance really occurs, it will have fatal consequences for the peace movement. We must strengthen the people's confidence in their own strength and prepare conditions for future victories.

Lafitte also talked about the relationship between the World Peace Council and other organizations. He suggested that the committee responsible for studying this issue discuss ways to conduct broader cooperation with all organizations that have made concrete contributions to the cause of peace. Lafitte said that I think these methods should be found in the activities of the upcoming campaign to demand consultation.

Lafitte also said that the World Peace Council includes representatives from seventy countries and has 296 council members. Among them are scientists, well-known figures in the arts, industrialists, working people, writers, military, political and religious figures. However, it cannot be said that the composition of the World Peace Council is completely commensurate with its current influence. Lafitte said that in many countries, some forces in the peace movement are not yet represented in the World Peace Council. On the other hand, in some countries, some forces have cooperated with the World Peace Council for a long time, but have no connection with the national movement. Lafitte suggested that this session of the World Peace Council open the doors of the Council to representatives of those forces.

The following also spoke at the afternoon meeting: Polish writer Jarosław Iwaszkiewicz, Greta Fouchhammer (Denmark), Mrs. Seza Nabarawi (Egypt), World Federation of Democratic Youth Secretary-General Jacques Denis, World Peace Council member Hugo van Dalen (Netherlands), Israeli poet Abraham Shlonsky, World Peace Council member Johannes Becher (German Democratic Republic), Kristinn Andrésson (Iceland), Mehran (Iran), André Andreen (Sweden), Professor Eisenstadt (Israel), Pastor Thompson (South Africa).

Xinhua News Agency, 19th dispatch: According to TASS, Budapest: The World Peace Council did not hold a plenary session on the 18th. The three committees of the meeting—the Committee on General Political Issues, the Committee on the Tasks, Composition and Mode of Activity of the World Peace Council, and the Committee on Cultural Exchange Issues, held meetings.

    拉斐德在世界和平理事会会议上
    详细说明理事会的任务和组成
    世界和平理事会会议的三个委员会开会
    【新华社十九日讯】据塔斯社布达佩斯讯：世界和平理事会十七日下午会议由吉洪诺夫担任主席。世界和平理事会总书记拉斐德在会上就世界和平理事会的任务和组成问题发表演说。
    会议开始时，印度科学家、联邦院议员萨蒂恩·鲍斯和日本前外务省次官、现任日中贸易促进会议主席山本熊一先后发言。萨蒂恩·鲍斯强调指出印度人民热爱和平。山本熊一说，日本不和中国贸易就不能生存。他表示希望中华人民共和国终能参加联合国。
    接着发言的是越南代表阮春水，他说，长久以来越南人民就在为世界和平运动所提出的原则而斗争着。他表示支持中国代表郭沫若在会议第一天提出的关于远东问题的建议。
    阮春水接着叙述了越南人民和高棉、寮国人民反对美国支持下的法国殖民者的斗争。他说：我们要求越南、高棉、寮国三个国家获得完全的独立，并生活在自由与和平的环境中。同样，我们希望法国不受任何外来的干涉。我们向法国人民呼吁，法国人民正在要求法国政府正视越南、高棉、寮国以及法国人民要求民族独立与和平的意志。我们知道，我们的斗争将是长期的、艰苦的，但是最后终会取得胜利。
    应邀参加这次会议的英国代表、考文垂市议会工党议员爱德华·狄克逊发言。他说，他特别对爱伦堡在十六日所发表的演说感到兴趣，尤其是对其中的两点：第一，世界和平理事会欢迎任何有关和平的建议，不管是谁提出的建议；第二，爱伦堡提到了英苏互助条约。爱德华·狄克逊说：要是英苏互助条约被严格遵守，国际情势就不会紧张，但是今天，英国并不尊重这一条约。我们国内的和平组织一定要集中力量来改变这种情况。人民知道英苏互助条约是稳定欧洲局势的一个重要因素。
    接着发言的是世界和平理事会总书记让·拉斐德。他详细说明了理事会的任务和组成。他说，世界和平理事会是一九五○年十一月在华沙举行第二届世界保卫和平大会的时候成立的。理事会的目的是使各国人民在争取和平的斗争中有经常的接触机会。世界和平理事会从一开始就是向主张和平的各种各样的舆论开门的，因此它能够接受各种力量的代表参加保卫和平的实际活动。有组织的和平运动认为，世界和平理事会的出现是一件有巨大历史重要意义的事件。
    世界和平理事会虽然还没有达到它的全部目的，但它对世界和平事业是有了贡献的，这是它理应引为骄傲的。不久以前，理事会发起了一个运动，要求五大国举行会议和协商，以缔结和平公约。现在有一些政府和一些高级官员也已经支持举行会议和协商这个意见了。世界和平理事会召开了世界人民和平大会，并使大会开得很成功。大会的主要任务是确使协商精神战胜以武力为基础的决定，这是符合全世界人民的愿望的。而现在，根据目前的国际事件来看，我们看到了可能缓和国际紧张局势的前景。
    这件事情说明了世界和平理事会所规定的目标的正确性。如果世界和平理事会不是一支真正的国际性的力量，如果它在各国没有正式的分支机构，如果它在决定政策时不是完全摆脱了政府，党派，以及一国的组织和国际组织的影响，那末，它的倡议和看法就不可能得到这样广泛的响应。
    世界和平理事会一直坚持不渝地遵奉着一条原则——不对某种政权或某种生活方式的优点或缺点作任何批评。它不干涉各国的内政，决定各国国内事务的权利属于各国人民。它认为，所有国家的大多数人民都有着共同的和平愿望。它要作为表达这种愿望的工具，它正不倦地寻求各种决定和具体建议，俾使所有希望和平的人们可以团结在一起。世界和平理事会的决议谈到了所有的问题，这些问题的解决对于维护和平是极端重要的。这些决议都符合于各国人民自己决定自己事务的权利。
    世界和平理事会的一般决议并不妨碍各国的主动性，这些决议并不是要使大家都是一样。它们只是强调各国人民本来所共同具有的和平愿望和各国人民的民族利益之间的关系。就各国和平运动的活动方式来说，是由每一个国家的和平运动自己决定应该采取的办法。世界和平理事会只提出在世界规模上应该采取的办法，这些办法能够毫无例外地得到各国人民的拥护。
    拉斐德说，我认为，世界和平理事会的这一性质将来还是应该保持下去。应该保持那些世界和平理事会的政策所依据的原则，即从以下两个前提出发的原则：
    世界上现有的制度能够、而且应该和平共处；各国间所有的分歧都能够通过协商得到和平的解决。
    本届会议的任务之一就是全面地说明世界和平理事会在以往一个时期中所起的作用。这并不是说我们是真理的唯一服务者，或是争取和平的唯一力量。然而，我们必须老老实实说出应该归功于世界和平理事会的所有成绩。为什么要这样呢？因为我们还没有完成我们的工作，今天的胜利还远不够完满。
    如果我们不注意这事，许多人就会认为现在已有迹象表明国际形势可能澄清，什么事都会自己变好起来：各国政府会很顺利地达成协议，外交家会进行人民所发起的事业并使之成功，因此，世界和平理事会与和平运动也许已不再有存在的必要了。假如当真发生了这种放松警惕的事，就会对和平运动发生致命的后果。我们要加强人民对他们自己力量的信心，并为今后的胜利准备条件。
    拉斐德又谈到世界和平理事会与其它组织的关系问题。他建议负责研究这个问题的委员会讨论与所有对和平事业有具体贡献的组织进行更广泛合作的办法。拉斐德说，我认为这些办法应该在即将开展的要求协商的运动的活动中去求得。
    拉斐德又说，世界和平理事会包括七十个国家的代表，有理事二百九十六人。其中有科学家、艺术界知名人士、工业家、劳动人民、作家、军事、政治和宗教界人物。不过现在还不能说世界和平理事会的组成与它现在的影响完全相称。拉斐德说，在许多国家里，和平运动中有些力量在世界和平理事会中还没有代表。在另一方面，在有一些国家里，有些力量与世界和平理事会已经合作了很长时间，但与民族运动却无联系。拉斐德建议本届世界和平理事会会议使理事会向那些力量的代表打开门户。
    在下午会议上发言的还有：波兰作家雅罗斯拉夫·伊凡希凯维奇、格雷塔·福希哈默（丹麦）、塞扎·娜巴拉薇夫人（埃及）、世界民主青年联盟总书记雅克·德尼、世界和平理事会理事雨果·范达伦（荷兰）、以色列诗人亚夫拉罕·什朗斯基、世界和平理事会理事约翰尼斯·贝希尔（德意志民主共和国）、克里斯丁·安德生（冰岛）、梅赫兰
    （伊朗）、安德烈·安德琳（瑞典）、艾森斯塔德教授（以色列）、牧师汤普逊（南非）。
    【新华社十九日讯】据塔斯社布达佩斯讯：世界和平理事会在十八日没有举行全体会议。会议的三个委员会——关于一般政治问题委员会，关于世界和平理事会的任务、组成和活动方式委员会，关于文化交流问题委员会，举行会议。
