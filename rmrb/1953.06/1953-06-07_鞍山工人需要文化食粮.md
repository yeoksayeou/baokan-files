    Anshan Workers Need Cultural Nourishment
    A letter from Wang Shoushan of the Anshan Municipal Federation of Literary and Art Circles: Anshan workers urgently need cultural nourishment, and also hope that writers will create more literary and artistic works depicting the production and construction of Anshan workers. Once, when workers saw a newsreel depicting the "Start of Winter Construction of Anshan's Basic Construction" premiering in a movie theater, all the audience became agitated and applauded enthusiastically. From the very first shot of the overall view of Angang on the screen to every small scene and action, they watched and discussed it greedily. However, there are too few works like this. Some workers often ask: "Why are there no works about Angang?" "We also have many heroic models here."
    In fact, many writers from other places have come to Anshan. From last summer to now, writers can be said to have flocked to Anshan in batches. Old writers, young writers, novel writers, screenwriters, filmmakers, but they came and went. Some came, took a cursory look, or went to "big" factories, talked to role models, stayed for a few days, and left. Some workers said that the writers who came to the factory were "like fishermen, scooping up a handful and leaving." Here, we appeal to writers to write more works that reflect Anshan's production and construction and the lives of workers.
    In Anshan, not only are there few works reflecting Anshan's production and construction and the lives of workers, but there is also a lack of basic cultural nourishment to meet the needs of the masses. Anshan has a population of 400,000, one-third of whom are workers. The city has only three cinemas (one is still under repair and has not yet opened), one Peking opera theater, one Pingju opera theater, and one People's Theater that is half-theater and half-conference hall, which together cannot accommodate 7,000 people. It is not uncommon to queue for half an hour or an hour to buy tickets to see a movie or a play. Moreover, these theaters are small and dilapidated. The "Anshan Cinema" has serious cracks in the building, and has recently been locked and the performances have been stopped. In the "Workers' Theater," the environmental hygiene is very poor, and the toilets are filled with stench. The Anshan Municipal People's Art Troupe is poorly led, has a low level of performance, and the content of the performances is divorced from reality, which cannot meet the needs of the people at all. The art troupe still does not have a fixed theater, and the rectification work has not been done. We are in great need of spiritual food, and we urgently need the support of cultural forces.

### 鞍山工人需要文化食粮

专栏：读者来信摘要

    鞍山工人需要文化食粮
    鞍山市文学艺术界联合会汪受善来信：鞍山工人迫切需要文化食粮，也希望作家多创作表现鞍山工人生产建设的文艺作品。有一次，工人们看到一部描写“鞍山基本建设冬季施工开始”的新闻短片在电影院里初次上映，所有的观众都骚动了，热烈地鼓掌。他们从银幕上最初的鞍钢全貌的镜头开始，到每一个细小的场面和动作，都贪婪地看着、议论着。但是，像这样的作品太少了。有些工人经常问：“为什么没有写鞍钢的作品呀！”“我们这里也有不少英雄模范呀。”
    事实上，从外地来鞍山的作家并不少，从去年夏天到现在，作家们可以说是成批地涌进鞍山。老作家、青年作家、写小说的、写剧本的、写电影的，但来了，又去了。有的来了，走马观花地看一遍，或者是去“大”厂，找模范谈谈，住上几天，又走了。有的工人说下厂的作家“像打鱼的一样，捞一把就走了”。我们在这里呼吁作家们多写些反映鞍山生产建设、工人生活的作品。
    在鞍山不仅反映鞍山生产建设、工人生活的作品少，也没有起码的文化食粮满足群众的需要。鞍山有四十万人口，其中三分之一是工人。全市只有三个电影院（一个还在修理，没有开始营业）、一个京剧院、一个评剧院、一个半演剧半开会的人民剧场，合在一起，容纳不了七千人。平时看电影看戏买票排半小时或一小时队，已经不是稀有的事了。而且这几个影院和剧院都是狭小、破陋的。“鞍山影院”房屋裂缝严重，最近已经锁门停演。“工人剧院”里，环境卫生很坏，厕所里臭气薰天。鞍山市人民文工团因领导弱，水平低，演出的内容脱离实际，根本不能满足人们的要求。文工团到现在没有固定的剧场，整顿工作也没有做。我们是太需要精神食粮了，我们迫切需要文化力量的支援。
