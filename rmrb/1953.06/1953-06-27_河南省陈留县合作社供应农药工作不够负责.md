    The Cooperative in Chenliu County, Henan Province, is Not Responsible Enough in Supplying Pesticides
    Letters from Chen Qinglian and Li Shouxin, labor models in Chenliu County, Henan Province, and Xu Ming, an agricultural technician, state: The cooperative in Chenliu County is not responsible enough in supplying pesticides. In March and April this year, insect plagues (wheat aphids and red spiders) occurred in some areas of Chenliu County. The county government asked the cooperative to quickly supply pesticides. However, the cooperative did not deliver the pesticides until the wheat had grown tall and the insect damage had lessened, rendering the pesticides ineffective.
    Before the Grain Rain solar term, farmers had already received cotton seeds on loan from the people's government, but the cooperative had not yet prepared the seed dressing chemicals. The cooperative did not deliver "Ceresan" until most of the farmers in the county had already planted their cotton seeds. As a result, most of the county's cotton was sown without seed dressing, making the seedlings susceptible to disease. On the other hand, a large quantity of seed dressing chemicals were stockpiled in the cooperative and could not be sold.
    Currently, cotton aphids have appeared in our county again. The cooperative has pesticides and equipment to control aphids, but it has not yet promoted or sold them to the masses. We request that our county's cooperative thoroughly correct this bureaucratic work style and earnestly do a good job in supplying agricultural production materials.

### 河南省陈留县合作社供应农药工作不够负责

    河南省陈留县合作社供应农药工作不够负责
    河南省陈留县劳动模范陈清连、李守信，农业技术员许鸣等来信：陈留县合作社供应农药工作不够负责。今年三、四月间，陈留县部分地区发生虫灾（麦蚜、红蜘蛛），县人民政府要合作社迅速供应农药。但合作社直到麦子长大、虫害减轻时，才把农药运到，使这些农药没有起应有的作用。
    在谷雨节前，农民的棉花种籽已由人民政府贷下，而合作社还没准备好拌种药剂。直到全县大部农民已把棉花种下，合作社才把“赛力散”运到。这样，一方面全县棉花大部没有拌种就下种了，棉苗容易发生病害；另一方面大量拌种药剂积压在合作社内，卖不出去。
    目前我县又发生了棉蚜。合作社已有治蚜药械，但仍未向群众宣传推销。我们要求我县合作社彻底纠正这种官僚主义作风，切实做好农业生产资料的供应工作。
