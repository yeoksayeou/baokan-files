Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, June 28th Dispatch from our special correspondent Jiang Nan: "Who controls the situation in Korea - Syngman Rhee? Or the United Nations Command?" Nehru raised this question on the 25th, which seems a bit strange, but it is indeed a question.

Clark claimed that he was the Commander-in-Chief of the United Nations Forces, but he actually said that he could not be responsible for Syngman Rhee "releasing" a large number of prisoners of war, which means that he did not control Syngman Rhee. On the contrary, it now seems that Syngman Rhee has controlled the Commander-in-Chief of the United Nations Forces, and has brought bad luck to other "allied countries" participating in the Korean War. Syngman Rhee ordered the "release" of prisoners of war, and Clark allowed him to take away a large number of prisoners of war from the American POW camps, and even ordered the American military police to "not move a finger" against the "released" prisoners of war. Syngman Rhee said that he did not want an armistice, and Clark could not sign the armistice agreement that was all ready. Syngman Rhee demanded to continue the war, and the United States immediately agreed to conclude a military alliance with him. Syngman Rhee is now threatening that if the United States does not accept his conditions, he will "embarrass the United Nations Command" by striking and withdrawing South Koreans working in the U.S. military.

What kind of guy is Syngman Rhee?

Syngman Rhee spent most of his life in the United States. He never participated in the Korean people's anti-Japanese national liberation struggle. He was completely unfamiliar with the Korean people. During World War II, he fawned on the American reactionaries like Dulles and Nolan. These reactionaries had long thought of using Korea as a springboard for wars of aggression, and they took a fancy to Syngman Rhee. In September 1945, MacArthur landed in Korea after the Soviet army defeated the Japanese aggressors. MacArthur disbanded the Korean people's own organization - the People's Committee, and preserved the entire police system used by Japanese imperialism to persecute the Korean people. Then, MacArthur brought Syngman Rhee from the United States and handed over the regime and this police system to him. Under the support of the American military authorities, Syngman Rhee protected the secret agents and police who had committed many evils during the Japanese occupation period and were hated by the Korean people, and thus gained the support of the latter. Syngman Rhee colluded with this group of fascists, making South Korea a truly fascist-ruled country. Everything was the same as during the Japanese imperialist rule, only a puppet Syngman Rhee was replaced, and behind this puppet was replaced an American master. Syngman Rhee existed entirely on the support of the United States and special agent rule. He was so unpopular in South Korea that in the 1948 election, people said that if a dog opposed Syngman Rhee, it would be elected. Only with the help of thugs, police, and US dollars did Syngman Rhee become president.

With the help of the United States, Syngman Rhee established an army. Three years ago, this army launched an attack on North Korea under the personal planning of Dulles.

In the three years of the Korean War, Syngman Rhee dedicated the lives and blood of 580,000 Koreans for the benefit of his American masters and himself, and caused indescribable disasters to the entire Korean people. Syngman Rhee showed in the war that he was not only a cunning and treacherous politician, but also a combative police dog, and therefore received the favor of American warmongers. In the three years of the war, Syngman Rhee, with the sole assistance of the United States, established an army of sixteen divisions, which the United States had to supply with everything from weapons and equipment to food and shoes. The Americans told him that as long as he could find more cannon fodder, they would be prepared to help him build up to twenty-two divisions.

Therefore, when the United States suffered heavy losses in Korea and, under the pressure of the people of the world, had to consider ending this war of aggression, Syngman Rhee found that his own value had increased. He knew that some people in the United States supported him and believed that the United States could not do without him, and the sixteen divisions of troops in his hands were a large capital for the United States to carry out wars of aggression. Therefore, the closer the Korean armistice got to being realized, the louder Syngman Rhee shouted, he "doesn't want an armistice," he wants to "continue fighting, even alone." As the American "Nation" magazine put it: "He was recently a puppet, grown up on American weapons, flattery and money, and now not only opposes the armistice terms proposed by the Allied forces, but also threatens to fight to prevent the implementation of these terms."

In this way, the puppet seems to have become the master, and the wolf dog seems to have climbed onto the hunter's head. But, strangely enough, those Americans who boast that they are the world's overlords do not feel embarrassed about this at all. What Washington is worried about is what will happen if Syngman Rhee dies during this critical period!

However, if anyone really thinks that Syngman Rhee can run wild without the United States, then they are too naive. Syngman Rhee exists by relying on the United States, not only does his army completely depend on the United States to maintain, but his political status was also created by the United States. Without the United States, there would be no Syngman Rhee. All of Syngman Rhee's actions to sabotage the armistice negotiations are inconceivable without the connivance of the United States. Under the connivance of the United States, Syngman Rhee is obviously becoming more and more rampant. The American "Christian Science Monitor" said well in its commentary on Syngman Rhee's sabotage: "The tail cannot act alone without the head moving; only when the head is out of its mind can the tail move around."

It is still unclear how the American "head" is moving now. Washington and Seoul are in a flurry of activity, and Eisenhower's special envoy Robertson has held his third meeting with Syngman Rhee today. But Syngman Rhee's "tail" has already moved so violently that it has thrown the realization of the Korean armistice to the edge of a cliff. Whether the "head" commands the "tail" or the "tail" commands the "head" is for Washington to decide and answer.

### 新华社记者彻底揭露李承晚是个什么家伙  更加证明离开美国李承晚决不能胡作乱为

    新华社记者彻底揭露李承晚是个什么家伙更加证明离开美国李承晚决不能胡作乱为
    【新华社开城二十八日电】本社特派记者江南报道：“谁控制着朝鲜的局势——李承晚呢？还是联合国军司令部呢？”尼赫鲁二十五日提出了这个问题，这似乎有点奇怪，但的确是一个疑问。
    克拉克宣称他是联合国军总司令，可是他竟然说他不能对李承晚“释放”大批俘虏负责，也就是说他没有控制李承晚。相反，现在好像是李承晚控制住了这位联合国军总司令，并且使参加朝鲜战争的其他“盟国”都跟着倒了霉。李承晚下令“释放”战俘，克拉克就听任他从美国战俘营里押走大批战俘，而且还下令给美国宪兵，使他们对被“释放”的战俘“动也不能动一下”。李承晚说他不要停战，克拉克就不能在已经一切就绪的停战协定上签字。李承晚要求继续进行战争，美国立刻就同意和他缔结军事同盟。李承晚现在还威胁说，如果美国不接受他的条件，他就要用罢工和撤退在美军中工作的南朝鲜人，来“使联合国军司令部为难”。
    李承晚是个怎么样的家伙？
    李承晚的大部分生涯是在美国度过的。他从来没有参加过朝鲜人民的抗日民族解放斗争。他对于朝鲜人民是完全陌生的。在二次世界大战期间，他巴结了美国反动派中杜勒斯、诺兰之流。这些反动派早就想到要利用朝鲜作为侵略战争的跳板，他们看中了李承晚。一九四五年九月，麦克阿瑟在苏军击败了日本侵略者以后在朝鲜登陆。麦克阿瑟解散了朝鲜人民自己的组织——人民委员会，把日本帝国主义迫害朝鲜人民的一套警察制度全部保存了下来。接着，麦克阿瑟从美国弄来了李承晚，把政权和这一套警察制度交给了他。在美国军事当局支持下的李承晚，保护了那些在日本占领期作恶多端而为朝鲜人民恨之彻骨的特务警察，因而取得了后者的支持。李承晚和这一批法西斯分子勾结在一起，使南朝鲜成了一个真正法西斯统治的国家。一切都和日本帝国主义统治时代一样，只是换了一个傀儡李承晚，而在这个傀儡后面换了一个美国主子。李承晚是完全依靠美国的支持和特务统治而存在的。他在南朝鲜不得民心到如此程度，以致在一九四八年的大选中，人们都说，要是有一只狗反对李承晚，它就会当选。只是依靠了打手、警察和美元，李承晚才当上了总统。
    靠着美国的援助，李承晚建立了一支军队。三年以前，这支军队在杜勒斯的亲自策划下发动了向北朝鲜的进攻。
    在三年朝鲜战争中，李承晚为了他的美国主子和他个人的利益，奉献了五十八万朝鲜人的性命和鲜血，并且使全朝鲜人民遭受了难以形容的灾难。李承晚在战争中显出他不仅是一个狡猾奸诈的政客，而且是一只好斗的警犬，因此更得到了美国的好战分子的宠爱。在三年战争中，李承晚在美国一手援助之下建立了十六个师的军队，这十六个师从武器装备到粮食、鞋子都要由美国供给。美国人告诉他，只要他能找到更多的炮灰，他们还准备帮助他建立到二十二个师。
    因此，当美国在朝鲜损失惨重并在全世界人民的压力之下，不得不考虑结束这个侵略战争的时候，李承晚发现自己的身价已经提高了。他知道在美国国内有人支持着他，而且认为美国也少不了他，他手里的十六个师的军队，是美国进行侵略战争的一笔大资本。因此，当朝鲜停战越是接近实现的时候，李承晚叫喊得就越凶，他“不要停战”，他要 “继续打下去，即使单独干也行”。正如美国的 “民族”周刊所说的：“他不久以前还是一个傀儡，靠美国的武器、吹捧和金钱而长大，如今不仅反对联军方面所建议的停战条款，而且扬言要作战以阻止这些条款的实行。”
    这样，傀儡似乎成了主人，狼狗似乎爬到猎户头上去了。但是，说也奇怪，那些吹嘘自己是世界霸主的美国人对这点倒并不觉得怎么难堪，华盛顿耽心的倒是一旦李承晚在这危急的时期中死掉了怎么办！
    但是，如果有人真的以为，李承晚可以离开美国而胡作乱为，那末是太天真了。李承晚是依靠美国而存在的，不仅他的军队完全要依靠美国来维持，他的政治地位也是美国一手造成的。没有美国，也就没有李承晚。李承晚的一切破坏停战谈判的行动，如果没有美国的纵容，是不能设想的。在美国纵容之下，李承晚显然是越来越猖狂了。美国的
    “基督教科学箴言报”在评论李承晚的破坏行为时说得好：“脑袋不动，尾巴决不能单独行动；只有在脑袋神志不清的时候，尾巴才能乱动。”
    现在美国“脑袋”怎样动，人们还不清楚。华盛顿和汉城正在忙忙乱乱，艾森豪威尔的特使罗伯逊今天已和李承晚作了第三次会谈。但是李承晚
    “尾巴”已经乱动得厉害，已经把朝鲜停战的实现抛到悬崖的边沿了。究竟是“脑袋”指挥“尾巴”，还是“尾巴”指挥“脑袋”，这要华盛顿来作决定和答复。
