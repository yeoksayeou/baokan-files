Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, June 26th: The Soviet people warmly support the Soviet government's issuance of the 1953 government bonds and are enthusiastically subscribing. The issuance and subscription of these bonds once again demonstrate the Soviet government's efforts towards peaceful construction and the surging patriotic spirit of the Soviet people.

    After the Soviet government's order regarding the issuance of government bonds was broadcast on the radio, mass rallies were held in factories, collective farms, and institutions across the country. Foreman Makayev of the Moscow Three Mountains Textile Factory said at a workers' rally at the factory: "The Soviet people always actively subscribe to state bonds. Subscribing to government bonds can consolidate the strength of our country. The united action of subscribing to government bonds will be our contribution to the cause of communist construction." Electrician Kudorenko of the Minsk Tractor Factory said at a workshop meeting: "While capitalist countries are using a large amount of wealth on expanding armaments, establishing military bases, and carrying out espionage and sabotage activities, our country is using a large amount of national wealth on peaceful construction, developing culture, and raising the living standards of the working people. We are willing to subscribe to state bonds with two weeks' wages to help the country build new factories, research institutes, schools, and housing." Renowned steelworker Murchich of the Kirov Factory in Leningrad said at a workshop meeting: "Our motherland's economic strength is so strong that the Soviet government can reduce the total amount of government bonds issued by half compared to last year. We are very happy to be able to further improve the strength of the Soviet state with our labor and savings."
    The Soviet Union has reduced prices once every year after the war, bringing enormous benefits to the people. The Soviet Union issues government bonds every year after reducing prices. In each subscription to government bonds, the Soviet people use their surplus income to support the country's construction. This year, the Soviet people have benefited from price reductions by no less than 53 billion rubles, while the government bonds they subscribe to amount to 15 billion rubles. In the past, the Soviet people subscribed with one month's wages or equivalent income, but this year, they are limited to subscribing with no more than two weeks' wages or equivalent income. The Soviet people expressed their support and gratitude for the policies of the Soviet Communist Party and the government at rallies. Novikov, an excavator assembler at the Ural Heavy Machinery Manufacturing Plant, said: "We sincerely thank the Soviet Communist Party and the government for their concern for the people. We know that our actual wages are increasing year by year, and working conditions are constantly improving. The issuance of these new government bonds will help further develop the national economy and further improve our lives." Chuginov, a farmer from the "Socialist Dawn Collective Farm" in the Voronezh region, said at a meeting of farm members: "Our motherland is becoming increasingly prosperous. Our collective farm's annual income has almost reached two million rubles. We have tractors, potato planters, and potato diggers, and the degree of work mechanization is over 90%. The government constantly shows us collective farmers infinite care. The new government bonds will make our lives even better."
    While subscribing to the new government bonds, the Soviet people are also launching a wave of labor enthusiasm. Miachev, the leader of the excavator team at the Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Power Station construction site, pointed out while subscribing to the government bonds: "I am happy to subscribe to the government bonds with two weeks' wages. On the one hand, I want to personally participate in labor, and on the other hand, I want to use my savings to complete the construction of the world's largest hydroelectric power station—the Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Power Station—as quickly as possible." Motolin, an assistant steelmaker at the Moscow "Sickle and Hammer" factory, also expressed his determination to complete the glorious task undertaken by the entire workshop with all his strength: to increase the production of several thousand tons of metal by the end of this year when subscribing to the government bonds.

Xinhua News Agency, June 26th: TASS, Moscow, June 24th: The Presidium of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions has passed a resolution on the participation of trade union organizations in the subscription of the 1953 Soviet government bonds. The resolution states: The Presidium of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions warmly supports and endorses the Soviet government's order on the issuance of the 1953 government bonds for the development of the Soviet national economy. The new government bonds are a huge contribution to the Soviet Union's peaceful construction and to strengthening the Soviet Union's strength. It will promote the increase of the material welfare of the working people and the further improvement of their cultural level. The Presidium of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions calls on all trade union organizations to actively participate in the work of launching the subscription of the 1953 government bonds among workers, staff, intellectuals, and all working people. All trade union organizations must widely explain the significance of the new government bonds to the masses and must enable the creative energy of the working people to achieve new successes in the labor of peaceful construction for the victory of communism. The Presidium of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions firmly believes that the Soviet government's order on the issuance of new government bonds will surely receive the most enthusiastic response from the working people throughout the Soviet Union. The Council calls on all trade union members, all male and female workers, engineers and technicians, teachers and doctors, agricultural workers, scientific, cultural and artistic workers, and staff members of Soviet agencies to unanimously subscribe to the new government bonds with two weeks' wages. The resolution emphasizes: The laborers of our motherland will take the action of unanimously subscribing to the government bonds as their new contribution to communist construction, and will once again demonstrate our rock-solid unity and our boundless love and loyalty to our socialist motherland, the great Soviet Communist Party, and our dear Soviet government.

    苏联人民热烈拥护和认购新公债
    全苏工会中央号召各工会组织积极参加认购公债工作
    【新华社莫斯科二十六日电】苏联人民热烈拥护苏联政府发行一九五三年公债，并踊跃认购。这次公债的发行和认购，再次表明了苏联政府对于和平建设的努力，以及苏联人民爱国主义精神的高涨。
    当苏联政府关于发行公债的命令由无线电广播以后，全国各地的工厂、集体农庄和机关里，纷纷举行了群众大会。莫斯科三山纺织厂副领班马凯耶夫在该厂工人集会上说：“苏联人民总是积极地认购国家公债。认购公债可以巩固我们国家的实力。一致认购公债的行动将是我们对共产主义建设事业的贡献。”明斯克拖拉机工厂电气工人库多伦科在车间会议上说：正当资本主义国家把大量资财用在扩张军备、建立军事基地、进行间谍和破坏活动上的时候，我们国家把大量国民资财用在和平建设、发展文化和提高劳动人民生活水平上。我们愿意以两星期工资认购国家公债，帮助国家建设新的工厂、研究所、学校、住宅。列宁格勒基洛夫工厂著名炼钢工人穆尔齐奇在车间会议上说：“我们祖国的经济实力这样强大，使苏维埃政府有可能把公债发行总额比去年减少一半。我们非常高兴能够以自己的劳动和积蓄来进一步提高苏维埃国家的实力。”
    苏联在战后每年都减低一次物价，使人民获得巨大的利益。苏联每年都是在减低物价以后发行公债的。在每次认购公债中，苏联人民又以盈余的收入来支援国家的建设。今年苏联人民从减低物价中得益不下五百三十亿卢布，而他们认购的公债为一百五十亿卢布。过去苏联人民都以一个月的工资或相等的收入来认购，而今年，他们被限制以不超过两星期的工资或相等的收入来认购。苏联人民在集会上纷纷表示了他们对于苏联共产党和政府的政策的拥护和感激。“乌拉尔重型机械制造厂”挖土机装配工人诺维科夫说：“我们衷心感激苏联共产党和政府对人民的关怀。我们知道我们的实际工资年年增长，劳动条件不断改善。这次新公债的发行将有助于国民经济的进一步发展，和我们生活的进一步改善。”沃罗涅兹州“社会主义黎明集体农庄”农民楚吉诺夫在庄员大会上说：“我们的祖国正在日益富强。我们集体农庄每年的收入差不多已达到二百万卢布。我们有了拖拉机、马铃薯种植机和马铃薯挖掘机，工作机械化程度达百分之九十以上。政府经常对我们集体农民表示无限的关怀。新的公债将使我们的生活过得更加美满。”
    苏联人民在认购新公债的同时，正掀起劳动的热潮。古比雪夫水电站工地挖土机组长米阿契夫在认购公债时指出：我高兴以两星期工资认购公债。我一方面要亲身参加劳动，另一方面要把我的积蓄用在最快地完成世界上最大的水电站——古比雪夫水电站的建设事业上。莫斯科“镰刀与锤子”工厂助理炼钢工人摩托林在认购公债时，也表示要以全部力量完成全车间所担承的光荣任务：到今年年底增产几千吨金属。
    【新华社二十六日讯】塔斯社莫斯科二十四日讯：全苏工会中央理事会主席团通过关于工会组织参加苏联一九五三年公债认购工作的决议。决议说：全苏工会中央理事会热烈支持并拥护苏联政府关于发行一九五三年发展苏联国民经济的公债的命令。新的公债对苏联的和平建设、对加强苏联的力量是巨大的贡献。它将促进劳动人民的物质福利的增进和文化水平的进一步提高。全苏工会中央理事会主席团号召各个工会组织积极参加在工人、职员、知识分子中，在全体劳动人民中开展认购一九五三年公债的工作。各工会组织必须广泛地向群众解释新公债的意义，必须使劳动人民的创造精力在为共产主义的胜利而进行和平建设的劳动中取得新的成就。全苏工会中央理事会主席团坚信，苏联政府发行新公债的命令，一定会得到苏联全国各地劳动人民的最热烈的响应。理事会号召全体工会会员、全体男女工人、工程师和技术人员、教师和医生、农业工作人员、科学文化和艺术工作者、苏联机关职员们，一致以两周的工资认购新公债。决议强调说：我们祖国的劳动者将以一致认购公债的行动，作为他们对共产主义建设的新贡献，将再一次显示我们磐石一般的团结，和对我们社会主义祖国、伟大的苏联共产党、我们亲爱的苏维埃政府的无限热爱和忠诚。
