Xinhua News Agency, June 2nd dispatch: Tokyo News: The General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo), the largest trade union organization in Japan, is preparing to convene a National Peace Economy Conference around June 20th to discuss the issue of Japan's economy turning to a path of peace, oppose the Japanese monopoly capitalist groups' use of layoffs, intensified labor, and other means to shift the economic crisis, and oppose further militarization of the Japanese economy.

The preparatory meeting for the National Peace Economy Conference was held in Tokyo from May 14th to 16th. With the participation of more than 100 union leaders and more than 20 economists, the preparatory meeting studied the fundamental causes of the Japanese economic crisis and reached preliminary conclusions.

On the 14th and 15th, the preparatory meeting listened to reports from economists in various economic sectors. They unanimously emphasized that the fundamental cause of Japan's economic poverty is the American occupation and the Yoshida government's rearmament policy. The preparatory meeting concluded that the panic currently occurring in various industrial sectors in Japan is entirely caused by the war policies of the United States and the Yoshida government. If this war economy is not destroyed and a peace economy is not established, the people's lives cannot be stabilized, let alone improved. In order to stabilize and improve the people's lives, it is necessary to carry out a resolute struggle against the war policies of the United States and the Yoshida government, with the working class as the core.

"Sohyo" is also scheduled to hold another preparatory meeting in Osaka around June 10th to further listen to the opinions of the Kansai region, an important economic area of Japan. Then, "Sohyo" will submit the opinions of the preparatory meeting to the workers in factories and mines across the country for discussion, and then make supplementary revisions before submitting them to the National Peace Economy Conference.

Takano Minoru, Secretary-General of "Sohyo," issued a statement on the National Peace Economy Conference, stating: "Sohyo" will launch a large-scale national movement to promote the realization of the National Peace Economy Conference resolutions.

    日本“总评”举行国民和平经济会议预备会议
    工会领袖和经济学家反对美日反动派的战争政策
    【新华社二日讯】东京消息：日本最大的工会组织日本工会总评议会（简称“总评”）准备在六月二十日左右召开一个国民和平经济会议，讨论日本经济转向和平道路的问题，反对日本垄断资本集团采用解雇、加强劳动强度等手段转嫁经济危机，反对使日本经济进一步军事化。
    国民和平经济会议的预备会议已于五月十四日至十六日在东京举行。预备会议在一百多个工会领袖和二十多个经济学家的参加下，研究了日本经济危机的根本原因，并作出了初步的结论。
    预备会议在十四、十五两日听取了各种经济部门的经济学家的报告。他们一致强调指出：造成日本经济贫困的根本原因是美国的占领和吉田政府的重整军备政策。预备会议作出结论说：目前日本各产业部门所发生的恐慌状态，完全是美国和吉田政府的战争政策造成的。如果不摧毁这种战争经济并建立和平经济，人民的生活就不可能安定，更不能提高。而为了安定和提高人民的生活，只有以工人阶级为核心，对美国和吉田政府的战争政策进行坚决的斗争。
    “总评”并订于六月十日左右在大阪再召开一次预备会议，进一步听取日本重要经济地区——关西地方的意见。然后，“总评”将把预备会议的意见交由全国各地的工厂、矿山的工人群众讨论，然后再作补充修改提交国民和平经济会议。
    “总评”事务局局长高野实就国民和平经济会议发表谈话，表示：“总评”将展开大规模的国民运动来促成国民和平经济会议决议的实现。
