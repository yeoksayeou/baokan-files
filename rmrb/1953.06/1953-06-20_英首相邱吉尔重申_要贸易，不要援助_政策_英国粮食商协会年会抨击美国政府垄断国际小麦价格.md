Xinhua News Agency, 18th Dispatch: Reuters, London reports: British Prime Minister Churchill reaffirmed in the House of Commons on the 9th Britain's policy towards the United States of "Trade, not aid!" He also said he very much favored Britain relying on "its own labor and efforts." Churchill said this sentiment was "very strong" in Britain and expressed the hope that "effective measures can be taken in the near future to express this sentiment."

Xinhua News Agency, 18th Dispatch: London News: At the annual meeting of the British Grain Merchants Association held in Liverpool earlier this month, Lockhart Holmes, Chairman of the Grain Merchants Association, fiercely criticized the US government's policy of subsidizing agricultural product exports for the profits of American agricultural capitalists. He complained that for many years, Europe – especially Britain – has had to buy American agricultural products at artificially high prices, which has undermined the economy of the "free world." He said: "This is all due to the US government subsidizing American farmers. Its method is: when agricultural product prices fall to a certain ratio of the cost of industrial products, the government will purchase a portion of the agricultural products from the market... However, when the United States wants to purchase goods from foreign countries, it always unhesitatingly takes full advantage of the weakness of these commodity markets."

Holmes mentioned the International Wheat Conference held in Washington in April, at which, under US pressure, a decision was made to extend the International Wheat Agreement for three years and increase the maximum price of wheat by 25 cents per bushel. He said: "From this, we can see that the US government intends to recoup from its foreign consumers at least a portion of what it has lost in the domestic market." Holmes pointed out that Britain did not agree to that new agreement. He said: "Britain is no longer tolerating this situation, which is very correct, because the taxpayers or consumers of the United Kingdom already have difficulty protecting our own farmers, let alone taking care of high-priced foreign producers."

Regarding the same issue, London's "Sunday Express" published a commentary on the 14th, gloatingly pointing out the wisdom of Britain's resistance to the aforementioned agreement used by the United States to monopolize international wheat prices. The report pointed out that since the Wheat Conference, the price of wheat on the Chicago Wheat Exchange has fallen to the price that Britain was originally willing to offer during the conference. (At that conference, Britain, a major wheat importer, and the United States, a major exporter, failed to reach an agreement due to a difference of five cents in price. The United States insisted on $2.05 per bushel, while Britain was only willing to offer $2.00 at most.)

The "Sunday Express" continued: "Britain has begun to receive the benefits of the far-sighted policy of the ministers (who attended the Wheat Conference)." Reflecting the views of British capitalists who have suffered from US monopoly prices since the war, the report said: "Britain's policy should always be to jump out of these international fixed-price agreements."

    英首相邱吉尔重申“要贸易，不要援助”政策
    英国粮食商协会年会抨击美国政府垄断国际小麦价格
    【新华社十八日讯】据路透社伦敦消息：英国首相邱吉尔九日在下院重申英国对美国的“要贸易，不要援助！”的政策。他并说他非常赞成英国依靠“自己的劳动和努力”。邱吉尔说这种情绪在英国“非常强烈”，并且表示希望“在不久的将来能够采取有效的措施，来表达这种情绪”。
    【新华社十八日讯】伦敦消息：在本月初在利物浦举行的英国粮食商协会年会上，粮食商协会主席洛克哈特·霍姆斯猛烈抨击美国政府为美国农业资本家的利润补贴农产品出口的政策。他抱怨说，好多年来，欧洲——特别是英国——不得不按照人为的高价购买美国的农产品，这使得“自由世界”的经济受到了破坏。他说：“这都是由于美国政府津贴美国农民的缘故，它的办法是：当农产品价格跌到对工业品成本的一定比率时，政府就从市场上收购一部分农产品……但是，当美国要向外国购货时，它总是毫不犹疑地充分利用这些商品市场的疲势。”
    霍姆斯提到四月间在华盛顿举行的国际小麦会议，那次会议在美国压力下决定把国际小麦协定延长三年，并把每蒲式耳小麦的最高价格提高二角五分美元。他说：“从这里，我们可以看到美国政府打算从他们的外国消费者身上捞回至少它在国内市场上损失的一部分。”霍姆斯指出，英国并没有同意那个新协定。他说：“英国不再容忍这种情况，这是非常正确的，因为联合王国的纳税人或消费者已很困难，保护不了我们自己的农民，更谈不到照顾外国的高价生产者了。”
    关于同一个问题，伦敦“星期日快报”十四日曾发表评论，得意地指出英国抵制美国用以垄断国际小麦价格的上述协定的得策。该报指出，自小麦会议以来，芝加哥小麦交易所的价格已跌到当初在会议期间英国曾愿意出的价钱。（在那次会议上，小麦主要入口国英国和主要出口国美国因五分钱价格之差，未能取得协议。美国一定要两元零五分美元一蒲式耳，英国最多只愿出两块美元。）
    “星期日快报”继续说：“英国已经开始收到（出席小麦会议）部长们的远见的政策的利益。”该报反映战后吃尽了美国垄断价格苦头的英国资本家的观点说：“英国的政策应始终是跳出这些国际固定价格的协定。”
