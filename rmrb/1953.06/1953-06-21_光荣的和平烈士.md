The U.S. government, disregarding the strong protests of the American people and the people of the world, executed Julius and Ethel Rosenberg on June 19th, based on the fabricated charge of being so-called "atomic spies," after they had been unjustly imprisoned for nearly three years. All peace-loving and righteous people around the world cannot but express their extreme indignation at this atrocity committed by the U.S. government, and express their profound mourning for the Rosenbergs, who were martyred for peace, justice, and truth.

World-renowned scientists, jurists, politicians, and public opinion in various countries have unanimously considered the Rosenbergs innocent and demanded that the U.S. government rescind its barbaric and unreasonable verdict. The movement to save the Rosenbergs in various countries has formed a worldwide wave of protests. The American people had formed a "National Committee for Fair Judgment in the Rosenberg Case," and constantly held demonstrations and petitions. However, the U.S. government turned a deaf ear to such a powerful voice of justice from the American people and the people of the world, and placed itself in a position condemned by all. History will forever record the U.S. government's criminal act of murdering the innocent Rosenbergs, so that generations of people will spit on those murderers.

The history of imperialism is filled with the bloody footprints of innocent people. The American rulers have abandoned reason, abandoned humanity, abandoned the law, and abandoned all the masks of "democracy and freedom," blatantly treading in Hitler's footsteps, deliberately using the lives of the Rosenbergs as sacrifices to create the so-called "atomic spy case," to incite anti-Soviet and anti-communist sentiment, to incite war, to intimidate peace-loving American people, and to threaten the peaceful life of the people of the world. Precisely because of this, the U.S. government's execution of the Rosenbergs was entirely a political conspiracy without any legal basis. It proves that the U.S. ruling clique is moving towards fascism day by day.

The verdict made by the U.S. government based on the "testimony" of a rogue named Greenglass, who was bought by it, has long been overturned by facts. Greenglass's own letter revealed the situation of his collusion with the U.S. government to fabricate false testimony. Even U.S. Supreme Court Justice Douglas had "serious doubts about the death sentence of the Rosenbergs," believing that the verdict was not in accordance with the law. The U.S. government, fearing that its conspiracy would be completely bankrupt in front of more and more people, unreasonably rejected the Rosenbergs' request for a retrial four times in a row. While intimidating and coercing the Rosenbergs, it also stated that as long as the two of them were willing to fabricate some so-called "confessions" of "espionage" according to the requirements of the U.S. government, they could be spared the death penalty. But the Rosenbergs, who upheld the truth, solemnly shattered this shameless attempt by the U.S. government. This even more powerfully proves that the charges imposed on the Rosenbergs by the U.S. government are completely fabricated.

Today, when peace-loving people all over the world are making persistent efforts to promote world peace and international security, the U.S. government is killing peace-loving people in the name of a deliberately fabricated "atomic espionage." This is not only intimidation of the American people, but also a provocation to world peace, a manifestation of the United States' continued pursuit of a "cold war" policy, which contradicts the peace gestures made by responsible officials of the U.S. government and their statements expressing willingness to ease the international situation. People cannot help but wonder, if the U.S. government is seeking peace, then why should it openly massacre innocent people who love peace? If the U.S. government is willing to resolve outstanding international issues through consultation, then why does it not hesitate to incite anti-Soviet sentiment at home with the blood of innocent people, creating an atmosphere of tension, fear, and unease? Obviously, this measure by the U.S. government can only be regarded as being interconnected with the recent war cries of some warmongers in the United States and the fact that the United States continues to implement a policy of war preparation. When the peace-loving Rosenbergs were trapped in iron cages and died in the electric chair, some powerful figures in the U.S. ruling clique stood high on the podium of Congress, shouting against peace, against the Soviet Union, and against resolving international disputes in a spirit of consultation. The innocent Rosenbergs died under the sound waves of these war cries.

The Rosenbergs sacrificed for peace. They have become glorious martyrs for peace in American history. Their heroic deeds will be engraved in the hearts of all honest people. In the nearly three years of courtroom struggle, the Rosenbergs demonstrated the lofty spirit of loving peace, upholding justice and truth, and being unyielding to force. They would rather die than sell their souls, "sell their faith in a peaceful world," and turn themselves into tools for undermining the friendship between the American and Soviet peoples and the friendship between the people of the world. They said: "We know that if we accept the verdict and admit guilt, if we express repentance, we can easily get a reduced sentence. But this path is not feasible for us… Even for the precious treasure of life, the price of abandoning the truth is too great. Because the life exchanged at this price is not glorious, the life exchanged in this way is worthless, and the life exchanged in this way is not respected even by ourselves." The Rosenbergs remained steadfast in the face of death and proudly announced: "Even under the threat of the pain of death, we will never yield, fabricate false testimonies, and abandon our rights as free American people in the face of autocratic tyranny."

The spirit of the Rosenbergs, who loved peace, will not die. Their heroic actions are a brilliant embodiment of the great spirit and firm will of the American people's love of peace and freedom. Although the U.S. ruling clique can use unreasonable court verdicts to threaten peace-loving people, and use the electric chair to kill peace fighters, it has not and cannot have a way to strangle the great spirit of peace-loving people, nor can it use conspiracy and murder to prevent the broad masses of people from further fighting heroically for peace. This criminal act of conspiracy and murder by the U.S. ruling clique can only expose its own fragility and make the American people see the ferocious faces of the U.S. ruling clique more clearly, thereby arousing their greater anger. The American people will gain greater strength from the heroic spirit of the Rosenbergs to strengthen their struggle for peace and democracy.

    光荣的和平烈士
    美国政府不顾美国人民和全世界人民的强烈抗议，竟以捏造的所谓“原子间谍”罪名，把坐了近三年冤狱的罗森堡夫妇于六月十九日处死了。全世界一切爱好和平的正义的人民，不能不对于美国政府的这一暴行表示极大的愤慨，而对于为和平、为正义和真理而殉难的罗森堡夫妇表示深远的悼念。
    世界闻名的科学家、法学家、政治家和各国的公众舆论，一致认为罗森堡夫妇是无罪的，要求美国政府取消它的野蛮无理的判决。各国人民拯救罗森堡夫妇的运动形成了世界规模的抗议浪潮。美国人民曾组成“争取罗森堡案公正裁决全国委员会”，不断地举行了示威和请愿。然而美国政府竟对美国人民和全世界人民如此强大的正义呼声充耳不闻，而把自己置于千夫所指的地位。历史永远记下了美国政府谋杀无辜的罗森堡夫妇的罪恶事件，使世世代代的人们去唾骂那些谋杀人命的凶犯。
    帝国主义的历史是充满着无辜人民的斑斑血迹的。美国统治者抛弃了理性，抛弃了人道，抛弃了法律，抛弃了一切“民主自由”的假面具，公然踏着希特勒的脚迹，蓄意利用罗森堡夫妇的生命作牺牲，制造所谓“原子间谍案”，来煽动反苏反共，来煽动战争，来恐吓爱好和平的美国人民，并威胁全世界人民的和平生活。正是因为这样，美国政府处死罗森堡夫妇，完全是一个政治阴谋，而没有任何法律根据。它证明美国统治集团正在一天天走向法西斯的道路。
    美国政府根据一个被它所收买的无赖格林格拉斯的“见证”所作的判决，早已被事实所推翻了。格林格拉斯的亲笔信就透露了他和美国政府串通制造假见证的情况。甚至美国最高法院法官道格拉斯也对罗森堡夫妇的“死刑判决有重大的怀疑”，认为这个判决不合乎法律。美国政府害怕它的阴谋将在越来越多的人们面前彻头彻尾地破产，竟接连四次无理拒绝了罗森堡夫妇提出的重审要求。它一边向罗森堡夫妇进行恫吓和逼供，一边又表示，只要他们两个人肯按照美国政府的要求，编造一些所谓“间谍案”的“供词”，就可以免于死刑。但坚持真理的罗森堡夫妇庄严地粉碎了美国政府的这个无耻企图。这就更加有力地证明了美国政府加给罗森堡夫妇的罪名完完全全是假造的。
    今天，当着全世界爱好和平的人民，正为促进世界和平与国际安全而坚持努力的时候，美国政府却以蓄意捏造的“原子间谍”的罪名来杀害和平人民。这不仅是对美国人民的威吓，而且也是对世界和平的一种挑衅，是美国继续执行“冷战”政策的一个表现，从而和美国政府的负责官员所作的和平姿态互相矛盾，和他们表示愿意缓和国际局势的言论互相矛盾。人们不能不怀疑，如果美国政府是要求和平的，那末又为什么要公然惨杀爱好和平的无辜者呢？如果美国政府是愿意用协商方式来解决国际间悬而未决的问题的，那末又为什么在国内不惜以无辜者的鲜血来煽动反苏，制造紧张、恐惧和不安的气氛呢？显然，美国政府的这种措施，只能认为是和最近以来美国某些好战分子的战争叫嚣以及美国继续执行备战政策的事实，互相关连的。当爱好和平的罗森堡夫妇陷身铁牢、死于电刑的时候，美国统治集团的某些有势力分子却高踞国会的讲坛，大喊反对和平，反对苏联，反对以协商精神解决国际间的争端。无辜的罗森堡夫妇就是死在这些战争叫嚣的声浪之下的。
    罗森堡夫妇是为和平而牺牲了。他们已成为美国历史上光荣的和平烈士。他们的英勇事迹将铭刻在一切正直人们的心里。在近三年来的法庭斗争中，罗森堡夫妇表现了威武不能屈的爱好和平、坚持正义与真理的崇高精神。他们宁肯死，也不肯出卖自己的灵魂，不肯“出卖对和平世界的信心”，不肯把自己变为破坏美苏人民友谊和全世界人民友谊的工具。他们说过：“我们知道，如果我们接受判决并承认有罪，如果我们表示悔过，我们就很容易得到减刑。但是这条路对我们是行不通的。……即使为了生命这样可贵之宝，抛弃真理的代价也是过于重大的。因为以这个代价换来的生命是不光荣的，这样换来的生命是没有价值的，这样换来的生命是连我们自己也不会尊重的。”罗森堡夫妇在死亡面前坚贞不屈，并昂然宣布：“即使在死亡的痛苦的威胁之下，我们也决不屈服，去编造假证词，在专制暴政的面前放弃我们作为自由的美国人民的权利”。
    热爱和平的罗森堡夫妇的精神是不会死的。他们的这种英勇行为，是美国人民热爱和平热爱自由的伟大精神和坚强意志的光辉体现。尽管美国统治集团能够用法庭的无理判决来威胁和平人民，用电椅来杀死和平战士，但是它却没有也不可能有办法来绞杀爱好和平人民的伟大精神，它也绝不可能用阴谋杀人的办法来阻挠广大人民更进一步地为和平而英勇斗争。美国统治集团这一阴谋杀人的罪恶行动，只能暴露它自己的脆弱性，并使美国人民更清楚地看到美国统治集团的凶恶面目，因而激起他们更大的愤怒。美国人民将从罗森堡夫妇的英勇精神中得到更大的力量，来加强他们争取和平与民主的斗争。
