Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, June 27th: Following the workers of Moscow, working people in enterprises across the Soviet Union held staff and worker meetings, expressing the Soviet people's sympathy for the German workers struggling for peace and democracy, and denouncing the schemes of the adventurers. Meetings were held in enterprises in Leningrad, Kiev, Minsk, Stalingrad, Rostov, Sverdlovsk, Gorky and other places. Workers at the "Hammer and Sickle" factory in Moscow, the construction site of Uprising Square, and actors and staff of the Grand Theatre also held meetings. An editorial in "Pravda" pointed out: Soviet workers rightly regard the adventure of foreign mercenaries in Berlin as a new and despicable encroachment by reactionary forces and fascism on the peace and security of all peoples. The editorial said: The Berlin events educate peace-loving people to be vigilant and require them to watch out for the schemes of the enemies of peace with undiminished keenness. In order to shatter the dark tricks of the reactionaries in the future, the working people of all countries and all progressive mankind will maintain the cause of defending and consolidating peace with greater determination.
