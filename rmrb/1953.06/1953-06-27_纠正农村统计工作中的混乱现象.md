    Correcting the Chaotic Phenomena in Rural Statistical Work
    The chaotic phenomena in rural statistical work in various parts of North China have indeed developed to an intolerable degree, exhausting many district and village cadres and hindering the normal progress of rural production and other work. In addition to seriously disturbing the people, this chaotic statistical work has caused various misunderstandings and concerns among the masses about the Party's policies. District and village cadres have adopted the approach of "evading if possible, resisting if possible, and estimating and reporting if resistance fails" towards this statistical work, fabricating figures haphazardly, directly causing chaos in the statistical work itself, making it impossible to establish necessary scientific statistical work. If leading organs use figures obtained in this way to make policy decisions, formulate plans, and guide work, it would harm the country and the people, and hinder the revolution.
    The fundamental reasons for the current chaotic situation in rural statistical work are:
    First, many leading organs, especially some higher-level leading organs, suffer from serious subjective work styles. When issuing statistical forms, they do not consider actual needs and possibilities, do not distinguish between priorities, and blindly and rigidly demand many statistical data from lower levels based solely on their subjective assumptions; they believe that the more forms issued, the more complex the content, and the faster the completion time, the better; the top "fires arrows indiscriminately," and the bottom "adds layers upon layers," concentrating on the district and village, resulting in a flood of forms that are impossible to cope with. Some villages receive an average of one to two statistical forms per day, and some are even sent directly to households, requiring the masses to fill them out. One form includes dozens, hundreds, or even more items, including annual and quarterly reports, as well as monthly, weekly, and ten-day reports, and irregular temporary reports or investigation outlines. Many leading organs do not conduct investigations or research, nor accumulate materials in ordinary times, and once they need to make a report or write a summary, they temporarily issue forms to lower levels, demanding figures, and urge them most urgently, wasting the most manpower and resources. Many forms issued to rural areas do not consider the actual situation in rural areas at all, attempting to thoroughly understand all the "family assets" of all farmers at once. Some emphasize "planned production," transplanting the methods of leading socialist collective farms to our rural areas today, requiring everything to be planned, requiring so-called "planning in the form of tables." Others completely disregard the current educational level of district and village cadres and the masses, as well as the technical conditions in rural areas, blindly demanding that they measure water sources, draw water conservancy charts, diagnose various livestock and even rodent diseases, and absurdly call this "science"! The provisions of some statistical tasks are completely aimless and unreasonable. For example, the statistics for mules and bees must be divided into male and female, the statistics for catching mosquitoes, flies, fleas, and lice must be calculated in kilograms and numbers, and rural women's menstrual belts must be divided into new, old, and improved. It would not be surprising if the compilation of these statistical forms came from ordinary comrades with insufficient knowledge and experience. What is surprising is that these statistical forms were issued as tasks after being approved by leaders who bear significant responsibility to the Party and the people. Human activities must have a purpose, and the words and actions of communists must have a clear political purpose; the reason why statistical work is necessary and advocated is nothing more than to use these figures to "start from the objective existence of actual things, draw rules from them, and use them as a guide for our actions." ("Selected Works of Mao Zedong" Vol. III, p. 820). The above-mentioned subjective practices will certainly not achieve such results, but will only be insufficient for success and more than sufficient for disturbing the people.
    Second, some leading organs and business departments have serious, deeply ingrained decentralism. There are many organizations, numerous tasks, high requirements, and everything requires "tabularization," and they are not connected to each other, each doing its own thing. Some government organs issue many investigation forms, investigation outlines, and investigation charts to lower levels without review and approval from the higher-level state statistical organs, and some business departments also issue them without review and approval from the higher-level Party and government leading organs or the same-level state statistical organs; some even issue forms to lower levels without review by the responsible personnel of their departments, but by ordinary staff members. Some statistical organs have irresponsible phenomena of lax review and random approval, treating the authority of review and approval as a "routine matter." For example, the "Survey Form for Farmers' Spare Time Schools" issued by the Hebei Provincial Statistics Bureau even has an item for the number of "middle school students" who are children and elderly. This is due to the lack of strict political supervision, insufficient organizational control, and weak ideological leadership of the statistical work by Party committees at all levels. Not only do various systems and departments engage in their own statistical work, but all kinds of central work and political movements are routinely statistically "comprehensively," and even various career institutions, such as savings, insurance, supply and marketing cooperatives, and various specialized companies, also issue forms to districts and villages according to the administrative system. And all these systems, departments, and units are not connected to each other, the content is repetitive, and everyone wants "basic figures" and wants to "grasp the overall situation," so that many statistical items far exceed their own scope of work, and therefore exceed their actual needs, causing serious waste of manpower and resources in all aspects. Subjectivism in statistical work has already been harmful, and coupled with decentralism, it will inevitably become rampant.
    In addition, individual departments and some leaders are fond of boasting, creating new things, and irrationally requiring lower levels to statistically collect some figures. These figures are of no use except to show off their achievements and make people look strange. This is no longer just a matter of subjectivism and decentralism.
    In order to correct the current chaotic phenomena in rural statistical work, the fundamental solution lies in overcoming subjectivism and decentralism in leading organs, especially in leading organs above the provincial level. In the continued in-depth struggle against bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of laws and discipline, in solving the problem of "five excesses" in districts and townships, we should effectively check the errors in the statistical forms issued by various regions and systems, and stipulate future improvement methods. This inspection can be carried out by the Party committee designating special personnel to be responsible, in a relatively concentrated scope, with the participation of leading personnel and relevant personnel of the same level statistical bureau. In the future, necessary statistical forms should be formulated in accordance with the regulations of the State Statistical Bureau and the actual needs of the work, and be practical and feasible, and be issued after careful review and approval by the provincial and municipal Party and government leading organs; when issuing them, the working methods and the powers and scope of the investigation, etc., should also be explained at the same time, stipulating which ones are typical investigations or sampling surveys, which ones are general reporting, which level and which person is responsible, and what work to combine with for investigation, etc., and no random actions are allowed. It is not allowed to issue forms to the masses for filling out at will. All business forms of each system must stipulate a strict review and approval system. Items that do not belong to their own business scope are not allowed to be listed as statistical items for issuing (when necessary, they can be borrowed from relevant departments at the same level), and those that belong to their own business scope are not allowed to be made and issued at will. Higher-level leading organs should be responsible for many errors in statistical work, but it is also wrong for some lower-level leading organs to blindly forward them regardless of the actual situation and fail to actively put forward opinions. Only the combination of top-down control and bottom-up supervision can effectively resist the prevalence of subjectivism and decentralism.
    We must adopt a firm attitude against the excessive issuance of useless and unfillable statistical forms. Because failing to adopt this firm attitude and tolerating the continued existence of this chaotic phenomenon and the continued suffering of cadres and farmers is a manifestation of a lack of a strong sense of political responsibility. However, if it is thought that in this way, no statistical figures and no statistical forms are needed, and therefore a resisting attitude is taken towards necessary statistical forms, or an unserious and perfunctory attitude is taken, it is also wrong and should be prevented. Leading organs in various regions should truly understand the importance of statistical work, pay attention to accumulating experience in statistical work, give play to their enthusiasm and creativity in their work, and improve the statistical work organizations, so as to gradually establish a practical and feasible statistical work system.

### 纠正农村统计工作中的混乱现象

    纠正农村统计工作中的混乱现象
    华北各地农村统计工作中的混乱现象确已发展到不能令人容忍的地步，已使许多区村干部穷于应付，妨碍了农村生产工作和其他工作的正常进行。这种统计工作中的混乱现象，除了严重扰民以外，还使群众对党的政策发生各种误解和顾虑。区村干部对于这种统计工作，采取了“能推就推，能抗就抗，抗不住就估计上报”的办法，胡乱捏造数字，直接造成统计工作本身的混乱现象，使得必要的科学的统计工作反而无从建立。领导机关如果根据这种办法弄来的数字去决定政策，编制计划，指导工作，则会祸国殃民，妨害革命。
    农村统计工作之所以造成今天这样的混乱局面，其最根本的原因是：
    第一、许多领导机关特别是某些高级领导机关存在着严重的主观主义作风。他们在颁发统计表格时，毫不估计实际需要和可能，不分轻重缓急，只凭自己的主观臆想，盲目地、硬性地、不切实际地向下索取许多统计资料；认为表格发得越多越好，内容越复杂越好，完成时间越快越好；上边“乱箭齐发”，下边“层层追加”，集中到区村，就是表格纷飞，无法应付。有的村平均每日收到统计表格一种到两种，也有的直发到户，叫群众去填报。一种表格包括几十项、几百项甚至更多一些，既有按年、按季报表，又有按月、按周、按旬报表，还有不定期的临时报表或调查提纲等。许多领导机关平时不调查不研究，不积累材料，一旦作报告，写总结，就临时向下发表格，要数字，而且催办最急，劳民伤财最甚。许多发往农村的表格完全不估计到农村的实际情况，企图一下子彻底摸清全体农民所有的“家底”。有的强调“计划生产”，把领导社会主义集体农庄的一套搬到我们今天的农村来，要求什么都作计划，要求所谓“计划表格化”。也有的完全不顾目前区村干部和农民群众的文化程度以及农村的技术条件，盲目地要求他们测绘水源，绘制水利图表，诊断各种牲畜直至老鼠的病源，并把这种荒唐做法居然名之曰“科学”！某些统计任务的规定，根本是无的放矢，毫无道理。如统计骡子和蜜蜂要分公母，统计捕打蚊、蝇、蚤、虱要论斤数和个数，农村妇女的月经带要分新旧和改良等。这些统计表格的编制如果出自知识不足、缺乏经验的普通同志之手，尚不足怪。令人惊讶的是这些统计表格之被当作任务向下颁发，有许多是经过对党对人民负有重大责任的领导人员所批准的。人的活动都要有目的性，共产党人的一言一动，更需有明确的政治目的；统计工作之所以有存在和提倡的必要，无非为了运用这些数字，“从客观存在着的实际事物出发，从其中引出规律，作为我们行动的向导。”（“毛泽东选集”第三卷八二○页）上述种种主观主义的做法当然得不到这样的结果，而只能是成事不足，扰民有余。
    第二、某些领导机关和业务部门有严重的根深蒂固的分散主义。组织多，任务繁，要求高，样样都要求“表格化”，彼此又互不联系，各搞一套。有些政府机关不经上级国家统计机关审查批准，有些业务部门也不经上级党、政领导机关或同级国家统计机关审查批准，擅自向下颁发许多调查表格、调查提纲和调查图表；甚至还有不经本部门负责人员审查，而由一般工作人员擅自向下颁发表格的。某些统计机关则有审查不严、胡乱批准的不负责任现象，把审查批准的权限当作“例行公事”。如河北省统计局批准下达的“农民业余学校调查表”中竟有所谓儿童和老年的“中学生”各多少一项。这是由于各级党委对统计工作在政治上监督不严，组织上控制不周，思想领导薄弱所致。不仅各系统各部门各搞一套统计工作，各种中心工作与政治运动都照例“全面”统计一番，连各种事业机关，如储蓄、保险、供销合作、各个专业公司等，也都按行政系统向区村颁发表格。而所有这些系统、部门和单位，又互不联系，内容重复，家家都要“基本数字”，都要“掌握全盘”，以致许多统计项目都远远超出自己所应管的工作范围，因而也超过了自己的实际需要，造成各方面人力物力的严重浪费。统计工作中的主观主义已为害不浅，再加上分散主义，必然泛滥成灾。
    此外，个别部门和某些领导者好大喜功，标新立异，毫无道理地要求下边统计一些数字。这些数字，除供自己炫耀成绩和使人看起来千奇百怪之外，别无用处。这已不仅仅是主观主义和分散主义的问题了。
    为了纠正目前农村统计工作中的混乱现象，其根本办法在于克服领导机关特别是省以上各领导机关中的主观主义和分散主义。在继续深入开展的反官僚主义、反命令主义、反违法乱纪的斗争中，在解决区乡“五多”问题中，应切实检查各地各系统所发统计表格中的错误，并规定今后的改进办法。这种检查可由党委指定专人负责，在较集中的范围内进行，同级统计局的领导人员及有关人员参加。今后必要的统计表格，应按国家统计局的规定和工作上的确实需要，制定切实可行的若干种，经省市党、政领导机关认真审查批准后下达；下达时，同时应讲明工作方法和调查的职权、范围等，规定何者为典型调查或抽查，何者为普遍填报，由那一级并什么人负责，结合什么工作去调查等等，不得乱来。不许随便发表格令群众填报。各系统凡属业务性的表格必须规定严格的审查批准制度，不属于自己业务范围的一律不许列为统计项目下达（必要时向同级有关部门借用），属于自己业务范围的也不得随意乱制乱发。统计工作中的许多错误，高级领导机关应负其责，但下面有些领导机关不顾实际情况，盲目照转，不积极提出意见，也是不对的。只有自上而下的控制与自下而上的监督相结合，才能有效地抵制主观主义和分散主义的流行。
    我们必须采取坚决态度反对滥发无用的和无法填写的统计表格。因为不采取这种坚决态度，容忍这种混乱现象继续存在、继续苦害干部和农民，就是政治责任心不强的一种表现。但如果以为这样一来，就是不要任何统计数字和任何统计表格了，因而对于必要的统计表格也采取抵制态度，或者采取不严肃的和潦草应付的态度，也是错误的，应注意防止。各地领导机关应切实了解统计工作的重要性，注意积累统计工作的经验，发挥工作中的积极性和创造性，健全统计工作机构，以期逐步地建立起实用的可行的统计工作制度。
