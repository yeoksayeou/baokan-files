    Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, June 28th: (Our Special Correspondent Jiang Nan) All indications are that the secret negotiations between the United States and Syngman Rhee for the conclusion of a so-called mutual defense treaty are nearing completion. Robertson held his third meeting with Syngman Rhee today. After the meeting, Robertson told a United Press reporter, "We can reach a common agreement." Ge Hongji, the head of Syngman Rhee's press office, also told United Press that he believes the negotiations between the US and Rhee have been completed.
    A United Press dispatch from Seoul said: Robertson and Syngman Rhee are discussing a temporary agreement to be concluded between the United States and Syngman Rhee before the conclusion of a mutual defense treaty. Because the mutual defense treaty must be approved by the US Senate, it will take a considerable amount of time. The so-called temporary agreement will give Syngman Rhee military guarantees before the conclusion of the mutual defense treaty.
    It is very clear that whether it is in the name of a mutual defense treaty or in the name of a temporary agreement, it is all the same, because there is only one purpose, and that is to further indulge Syngman Rhee, so that he has enough capital to more arrogantly sabotage the armistice.
    The United States' indulgent attitude toward Syngman Rhee is very dangerous. This danger can now be seen very clearly. Dulles announced on the 26th that Eisenhower is willing to send anyone Syngman Rhee likes to hold their political meeting with Syngman Rhee before the political conference is convened to discuss the future of Korea. Syngman Rhee hinted today that he hopes Eisenhower will send MacArthur or Van Fleet to hold a meeting with him. The United States is about to conclude a so-called temporary agreement with Syngman Rhee that will enable Syngman Rhee to sabotage the armistice before the armistice agreement is signed, and is also preparing to send any warmonger that Syngman Rhee likes to hold a political meeting with Syngman Rhee. It would be a fantasy to say that the result of this behavior by the United States would be conducive to the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue! It is already very clear that Syngman Rhee will use the military alliance he concluded with the United States to continue to sabotage the armistice and provoke a new war.
    The people of Korea and China and the peace-loving people of the world, including the American people, have worked for three years to make the Korean armistice possible. But now, Americans, British, French, Canadians... are again in danger of shedding blood for Syngman Rhee's personal ambitions. This also explains why the United States is conducting its negotiations with Syngman Rhee so secretly. The United States is obviously afraid that its act of betraying peace will be opposed by the people of the world. But no matter how much the United States tries to cover up, it will not be able to escape the question: Does the United States really want a peaceful resolution to the Korean issue?

### 美国和李承晚竟进行秘密谈判  进一步纵容李承晚蛮横地破坏停战

    美国和李承晚竟进行秘密谈判
    进一步纵容李承晚蛮横地破坏停战
   【新华社开城二十八日电】本社特派记者江南报道：从所有的迹象看来，美国和李承晚之间为了缔结所谓共同防御条约而进行的秘密谈判已经快要完成了。罗伯逊今天和李承晚举行了第三次会谈。在会谈以后，罗伯逊告诉合众社记者说，“我们能够获致共同的协议”。李承晚的新闻处处长葛弘基也对合众社说，他认为美、李之间的谈判已经完成。
    汉城美联社的消息说：罗伯逊和李承晚所谈的是美国和李承晚在共同防御条约缔结之前，先订立一个临时协定。因为共同防御条约要经过美国参议院批准，所以需要相当长的时间。而所谓临时协定将在共同防御条约缔结以前，给予李承晚以军事上的保证。
    事情很明显，无论用共同防御条约的名义，或者用临时协定的名义，全都一样，因为目的只有一个，这就是进一步纵容李承晚，使他有足够的本钱来更加蛮横地破坏停战。
    美国对李承晚这种纵容的态度是十分危险的。这种危险性现在已经可以看得很清楚。杜勒斯二十六日宣布，艾森豪威尔愿意派李承晚喜欢的任何人，在政治会议召开之前和李承晚举行他们的政治会议，以讨论朝鲜前途问题。李承晚今天暗示，他希望艾森豪威尔派麦克阿瑟或范佛里特和他举行会议。美国既要在停战协定尚未签字以前就和李承晚缔结一个使李承晚能够破坏停战的所谓临时协定，又准备派李承晚所喜欢的任何好战分子去和李承晚开政治会议。如果说美国这种行为的结果会是有助于朝鲜问题的和平解决，那才是天下奇谈！李承晚将要利用美国和他缔结的军事同盟来继续不断地破坏停战挑起新的战争，这已经是再明显也没有了。
    朝中人民和全世界爱好和平的人民包括美国人民在内作了三年的努力，才使朝鲜停战成为可能。但是现在，美国人、英国人、法国人、加拿大人……，又有继续为了李承晚的个人野心而流血的危险了。这也就说明：为什么美国要把它和李承晚之间的谈判如此鬼鬼祟祟地进行。美国显然害怕它这种出卖和平的行为遭到全世界人民的反对。但是，无论美国怎样遮遮掩掩，它将不能逃避这样一个问题：美国究竟要不要和平解决朝鲜问题？
