Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 29th: Moscow newspapers on the 28th published an article by A. Zverev, the Minister of Finance of the Soviet Union, summarizing the achievements of the issuance of the 1953 government bonds.

    Zverev first stated: The issuance of the 1953 National Economic Development Bonds amounted to 15 billion rubles, but within three days, the amount subscribed reached 15.343 billion rubles. The Soviet people's unanimous support for the issuance of the bonds and the smooth subscription powerfully demonstrates their unity and their ardent support for the various measures taken by the Communist Party and the Soviet government.

    Zverev then said: The purpose of the Soviet government bonds is to develop peaceful economic construction and cultural construction. The funds from the new bonds will be used to build new factories, equip machine tractor stations with more tractors, combines, and other agricultural machinery, and promote the development of science, public education, and public health. At the same time, the bonds can also provide residents with considerable income. For example, from 1952 to 1953, approximately 17 billion rubles were paid to residents in the form of prize money from winning bond numbers.

    Zverev pointed out: The issuance of the 1953 bonds was reduced to half of last year's amount due to the continuous increase in socialist cash accumulation. This increase is the result of the successful implementation of the National Economic Development Plan and a testament to the further tremendous upsurge in the Soviet economy. The development of social production guarantees the continuous growth of national income and makes it possible to systematically improve the material welfare of the Soviet people. At the same time, the significant reduction in the amount of bonds issued compared to last year and the smooth completion of the bond subscription work also prove the stability of the Soviet ruble and the soundness of Soviet finances. The soundness of the finances and monetary system of the socialist state is due to the continuous development of the socialist peaceful economy and the continuous increase in national income. In the post-war period, due to the continuous development of various sectors of the national economy, the substantial reduction in production costs, and the consequent continuous reduction in retail prices of food and manufactured goods, the Soviet ruble has become more stable year by year, and its purchasing power has been increasing. In the past five years or more, the purchasing power of Soviet currency has more than doubled. The Soviet people know that they can now buy more than twice as many goods for the same amount of money as they could at the end of 1947.

    Zverev concluded: The Soviet Communist Party and the government constantly care about improving the living standards of Soviet citizens and ensuring the stability of their income and wages. The Soviet people's subscription to the bonds at a high level of political awareness during the great production upsurge in industry and agriculture guarantees the income from the bond item in the 1953 budget, which will be used to promote the successful completion of the national economic plan.

    兹维列夫著文总结苏联新公债发行的成绩
    【新华社二十九日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：二十八日莫斯科各报刊载了苏联财政部部长阿·兹维列夫的一篇文章，总结一九五三年公债发行的成绩。
    兹维列夫首先说：一九五三年发展国民经济公债的发行额为一百五十亿卢布，但在三天之内认购的数目就达到了一百五十三亿四千三百万卢布。苏联人民一致拥护公债的发行和顺利认购公债，有力地证明了他们的团结一致，以及他们对于共产党和苏维埃政府所采取的各项措施的热烈拥护。
    兹维列夫接着说：苏联公债的目的是为了发展和平的经济建设和文化建设。新公债的款项将用来兴建新的工厂，使机器拖拉机站得到更多的拖拉机、联合机和其他农业机器，并促进科学、公共教育事业和公共卫生事业的发展。但同时，公债还可以使居民得到相当多的收入。例如，从一九五二年到一九五三年，用公债券中签奖金的形式付给居民的款项，就有约一百七十亿卢布。
    兹维列夫指出：一九五三年公债的发行额减为去年数额的一半，是由于社会主义现金积累的不断增加。而这种增加又是胜利实施国民经济发展计划的结果，同时也是苏联的经济有了进一步巨大高涨的证明。社会生产的发展保证国民收入的不断增长，并使有步骤地增进苏联人民的物质福利成为可能。同时，公债发行数额比去年大大减少以及认购公债工作的顺利完成，也证明了苏维埃卢布的稳定和苏维埃财政的健全。社会主义国家财政和它的货币制度的健全是由于社会主义的和平经济的不断发展和国民收入的不断增加。在战后时期中，由于国民经济各部门的不断发展、生产成本的大大减低以及随之实行的食品和制成品零售价格的连续减低，苏维埃卢布一年比一年更为稳固，它的购买力一直在提高。在过去五年多的时期中，苏联货币的购买力已提高了一倍多。苏联人民知道，现在，他们能够以同样多的钱买到比一九四七年年底多一倍以上的物品。
    兹维列夫最后说：苏联共产党和政府经常关怀苏联公民生活水平的改善并保障他们收入和工资的稳定。苏联人民在工业和农业巨大的生产高潮中，在高度的政治水平上认购的公债，使一九五三年预算中的公债项下的收入有了保证，这笔收入将用在促进国民经济计划的顺利完成上面。
