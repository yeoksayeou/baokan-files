Not Being Misled by the Phenomenon of Exceeding Production Targets
    Northeast Electrical Engineering Fifth Factory Analyzes Production Situation and Improves Work Plan

    Starting from the end of April, the state-owned Northeast Electrical Engineering Fifth Factory has been systematically and focusedly improving its planning management work.

    In the past, the Electrical Engineering Fifth Factory had achievements in completing production tasks. The plan for major products in the first quarter of this year was completed at 100% to 125%. However, this production index exceeding the plan cannot conceal the significant shortcomings of the factory in planning management. The situation in the factory's key workshop—the Metalworking Workshop—can be taken to illustrate this problem.

    The Metalworking Workshop completed its June production task in early May. However, this does not mean that production management is effective, but only that the strong production capacity has not been utilized in a planned manner, and the work plan cannot control production. The following is the chaotic situation of production in the Metalworking Workshop:

    Unbalanced production progress. Among the five work sections in May's production tasks, three work sections were completed around April 10th, one work section was completed on April 28th, and one work section was completed around May 10th. Due to the imbalance in production progress, processes cannot be connected. As a result, the machining group is busy first and then slack; the fitter group is slack first and then busy, and does odd jobs when idle.

    Unbalanced equipment and unreasonable labor allocation. The hexagonal lathe in the fourth work section is often idle, while the fifth work section lacks a hexagonal lathe; the fitter in the third work section is short of two people, while the fitter in the fifth work section has two people idle. According to statistics on May 4th, out of the 74 machine tools in the entire workshop, only 40 were frequently running, and 34 were often not running, or running intermittently.

    Untimely supply of raw materials, production is interrupted from time to time, and there are too many pinholes in various copper castings, resulting in 60% of defective products after processing. This causes the workshop to frequently stop work waiting for materials.

    Production is abnormal, and labor discipline is very lax. Most workers do not abide by the rules of going to and leaving work, and do not abide by operating time. After workers go to work, they chat in groups of three or two, and on average, each person can only work for five hours.

    Unrealistic quotas and original records, and the work plan does not work. When the factory investigated and discussed the national plan, some people were afraid that high quotas would affect the morale of the workers, so they set the quotas very conservatively. Leading cadres and workers do not pay attention to original records, and original records are not accurate. Each recorder has to be responsible for recording about 30 workers on average, and can only do a "cursory" job, recording as much as the workers report. Therefore, the quota lacks a scientific basis. The inaccuracy of working hour quotas is even more serious. For example, each person can make 120 iron core frames per day, but the planned working hours are 40 per person per day, a difference of two times; for 180 kVA transformer low-voltage frames, each person can make more than 30 per day, and the planned working hours are five, a difference of more than five times. According to preliminary investigation and statistics of the second work section, among the 259 processes of 40 kinds of parts, the actual working hours are 50% to 200% lower than the original record in 112 processes, accounting for about 43% of all processes; only 29 processes are higher than the original record, accounting for only 11% of all processes.

    Due to the conservative and inaccurate working hour quotas, serious errors in the labor plan and a large number of waste phenomena have been caused. According to preliminary estimates, in addition to completing the national annual production task in August, the entire factory can also draw more than 400 workers for technical training.

    Due to the lack of material consumption quotas, it is impossible to compile a practical material supply plan, and as a result, the supply work is in a blind state.

    The responsibility system is unsound, and the work of the sections and shares is divorced from production. The plan was changed 18 times in the first quarter, and the plan was not coordinated with production and sales, material supply, product design, etc. For example, in the first quarter, the planning section planned to produce 260 Soviet-style HOM-35 voltage transformers. The business section was afraid of backlog and reduced it to 40 units. When the production section compiled the production schedule, it was afraid that the workshop's capacity would be insufficient and revised it to 10 units. As a result, the workshop only produced 5 units. It was planned to produce VSOE-44 mutual inductors in March, but the drawings could only be made in May. The technical section does not formulate inspection standards, and the inspection section only sends ordinary workers to inspect the quality.

    After analyzing the above situation, the Electrical Engineering Fifth Factory organized original record groups, work plan groups, and responsibility system groups respectively, focusing on the Metalworking Workshop, and improved plan management step by step. Now, the original record group has summarized the experience of combining group leader dispatching and recording and controlling working hours implemented in the large transformer workshop. This experience basically overcomes the shortcomings of inaccurate original records in the past; at the same time, with the planning section as the main body, the various previous quotas and the original records of the first quarter were analyzed and compared, and a set of benchmark quotas was compiled. The work plan group and the responsibility system group are formulating work plans and regulations and responsibility systems for implementing work plans, formulating workshop material and tool supply systems and work rules, and formulating equipment maintenance systems and instruction charts. After the factory gains preliminary experience in the Metalworking Workshop, it will conduct factory-wide improvement of plan management work.

    不被超过生产指标的现象所迷惑
    东北电工五厂分析生产情况改进作业计划
    国营东北电工五厂从四月底开始，有计划有重点地改进计划管理工作。
    过去，电工五厂在完成生产任务方面是有成绩的。今年第一季度的主要产品计划完成了百分之一百到一百二十五。但是，这一个超过计划的生产指数掩盖不了该厂在计划管理方面的重大缺点。可以拿该厂关键车间——金工车间的情况来说明这个问题。
    金工车间于五月上旬就完成了六月份的生产任务。但这绝不能说明生产管理有方，而只能说明雄厚的生产能力没得到有计划的发挥，作业计划不能控制生产。下面是金工车间生产混乱的情形：
    生产进度不平衡。五月份的生产任务在五个工段中，有三个工段在四月十日前后完成，有一个工段在四月二十八日完成，有一个工段在五月十日左右才完成。由于生产进度不平衡，工序与工序就不能衔接。结果是机工组先紧后松；钳工组先松后紧，闲着没活干时就干杂活。
    设备不平衡，劳动配备不合理。四工段的六角车床经常有一台闲着，而五工段却缺少一台六角车床；三工段的钳工缺两个人，而五工段的钳工却有两个人闲着。据五月四日统计，全车间七十四台机床，经常开动的只有四十台，有三十四台经常不动，或时开时停。
    原材料供应不及时，生产不时中断，加以各种铸铜件的砂眼太多，加工后有百分之六十的废品。这就使车间经常停工待料。
    生产不正常，劳动纪律十分松弛。大多数工人不遵守上下班制度，不遵守操作时间。工人上班之后，三个一堆两个一伙地闲谈，平均每人只能干五个钟头活。
    定额与原始记录不切实际，作业计划不起作用。该厂查定与讨论国家计划时，有人害怕定额高了会影响工人的情绪，把定额定的很保守。领导干部和工人都不重视原始记录，原始记录不准确。记录员每人平均要负责三十名左右工人的记录，只能作到“走马看花”，工人报多少就记多少。因此，定额就缺乏科学的根据。工时定额的不准确更加严重。如铁心架每人每天可作一百二十个，可是计划工时每人每天为四十个，相差二倍；一百八十千伏安变压器底压架，每人每天可作三十多个，计划工时为五个，相差五倍多。据二工段的初步查定统计，四十种部件二百五十九道工序中，实际工时低于原始记录百分之五十到二百的，有一百一十二道工序，约占所有工序的百分之四十三；高于原始记录的只有二十九道工序，仅占所有工序的百分之十一。
    由于工时定额的保守和不准确，造成了劳动计划上的严重错误和大量的浪费现象。据初步估计，国家全年生产任务除在八月份可以全部完成外，全厂还可以抽出四百名以上的工人进行技术训练。
    由于没有材料的消耗定额，不可能编制切合实际的材料供应计划，结果供应工作处于盲目状态。
    责任制度不健全，科股工作与生产脱节。第一季度的计划变更十八次，计划与产销、材料供应、产品设计等互不配合。如第一季度计划科计划生产二百六十台苏式HOM三五电压互感器，业务科怕积压，削减为四十台，生产科编制生产进度时，怕车间能力不足又修改为十台，结果车间只生产了五台。计划三月份生产VSOE四四互感器，可是图纸五月份才能作出。技术科不制定检查标准，检查科只派普通工检查质量。
    电工五厂分析了上述情况后，分别组织原始记录组、作业计划组、责任制度组，以金工车间为重点，有步骤地改进计划管理。现在，原始记录组已经总结了大变压器车间实行的组长派工与记录结合及控制工时的经验，这个经验基本上克服了过去原始记录不准确的缺点；与此同时，以计划科为主，分析比较了以前的各种定额与第一季度的原始记录，整理出一套基准定额。作业计划组和责任制度组，正在制造作业计划及执行作业计划的规程和责任制度，制订车间材料、工具供应制度和工作细则，制订设备检修制度和指示图表。该厂待金工车间取得初步经验后，就进行全厂性的改进计划管理工作。
