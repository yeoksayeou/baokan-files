Xinhua News Agency, 5th: Washington News: The United States News Agency recently revealed that the American ruling group is afraid of the Soviet Union's peaceful policies being deeply rooted in the hearts of the people of Western Europe. They are afraid that the American plan to establish a European aggressive army will be difficult to achieve.

This official American news agency said in a message issued on May 31, "Recent public discussions have shown that there is great anxiety about the fate of the European Defense Community agreement—an agreement that has long been considered the 'key' to America's Western European defense policy. The first anniversary of the signing of this 'historic' document has passed, and many commentators are pessimistically saying that so far, only West Germany has completed parliamentary ratification work."

The message also said: "France's attitude is the 'main obstacle' to the establishment of the European Defense Community... Moreover, many observers believe that the ratification movement elsewhere on the (Western European) continent is rapidly losing its momentum due to Moscow's 'peace offensive' and Churchill's recent suggestion to hold a 'high-level meeting' with the Soviet Union."

The message also quoted the important mouthpiece of American big business, "U.S. News & World Report" magazine, as saying that the idea of holding a meeting with the Soviet Union currently occupies "the center of the (European) stage, hindering further progress of the European Defense Community."

The United States News Agency admitted that the "European Army" plan only received "weak support." Therefore, according to the United States News Agency, some figures in the American ruling group are planning to use "another set of methods to replace the European Army." Regarding this, the message quoted an opinion from the "Washington Post" saying that making West Germany a formal member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and directly reviving the Nazi Wehrmacht is "the only acceptable alternative."

    苏联和平政策深入西欧各国人心
    美国统治集团担忧“欧洲军”计划难以实现
    【新华社五日讯】华盛顿消息：美国新闻处最近透露：美国统治集团对苏联和平政策在西欧各国深入人心感到恐惧，他们害怕美国建立欧洲侵略军的计划难以实现。
    这个美国官方新闻机关在五月三十一日发出的一条消息里说：“最近公众的讨论显示：对于欧洲防务集团协定的命运存在着很大的不安——这个协定很久以来就被人认为是美国的西欧防务政策的‘关键’。签订这个具有‘历史意义’的文件的第一周年过去了，许多评论家都悲观地说：到现在为止，只有西德完成了议会的批准工作。”
    这条消息又说：“法国的态度是建立欧洲防务集团的‘主要障碍’。……而且，很多观察家认为，（西欧）大陆别处的批准运动，由于莫斯科的‘和平攻势’和邱吉尔最近建议和苏联举行‘高级会议’的影响，正在迅速地失去其推动力。”
    这条消息还转引了美国大企业的重要喉舌“美国新闻与世界报道”杂志的话说，和苏联举行会议的思想目前占着“（欧洲）舞台的中心，它阻碍着欧洲防务集团的进一步前进”。
    美国新闻处承认，“欧洲军”计划只得到“微弱的支持”。因此，据美国新闻处说，美国统治集团中一部分人物已在打算用“另一套办法来代替欧洲军”。关于这一点，这条消息引“华盛顿邮报”的一个意见说，使西德成为北大西洋公约组织的正式成员国，并且直接复活纳粹国防军，是“唯一可以接受的代替方法”。
