To Commander Peng Dehuai and all commanders and combatants of the beloved Chinese People's Volunteers:

    We, the representatives attending the founding meeting of the Buddhist Association of China, extend to you our most sincere greetings and highest respect.

    The great victory of resisting America and aiding Korea over the past three years has severely struck the aggressive schemes of American imperialism, greatly enhanced the confidence of the people of the world in peace, guaranteed the security and peaceful construction of our motherland, and defended peace in the Far East and the world.

    Since liberation, Chinese Buddhists have gained freedom of religious belief. We thank and support Chairman Mao's brilliant policy of freedom of religious belief. Chinese Buddhists, along with the Chinese people, have actively participated in the movement to resist America and aid Korea, as well as other patriotic movements and the movement to defend world peace. Volunteer heroes: Your heroic and selfless fighting is a lofty model for the people of the whole country. We, all the representatives, hereby assure you: We must better learn from your noble spirit of patriotism, unite more closely around Chairman Mao, the Chinese Communist Party, and the Central People's Government, contribute all our strength, and resolutely struggle to win the complete victory of resisting America and aiding Korea and the fair and reasonable settlement of the Korean issue.
             All Representatives of the Founding Meeting of the Buddhist Association of China
