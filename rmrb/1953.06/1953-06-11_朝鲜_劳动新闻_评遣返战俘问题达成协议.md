Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, June 10th: The North Korean "Rodong Sinmun" published an editorial on June 10th entitled "The Fruit of Our Consistent Sincerity and Efforts," stating: Thanks to our unremitting and sincere efforts, the two sides in the Korean armistice negotiations have reached a complete and final agreement on the issue of repatriation of prisoners of war, which was hindering the realization of the Korean armistice. The content of the agreement clearly proves the fairness of our plan. All peace-loving people in the world have expressed warm support and welcome for this news from Panmunjom. The day of the Korean armistice is approaching.

The editorial pointed out: In the tortuous process of the Korean armistice negotiations, our firm will to strive for peace and the sincere efforts we have made have made a great contribution to the cause of defending peace in the world today. The complete agreement on the issue of repatriation of prisoners of war is a heavy blow to the warmongers who are trying to continue the Korean War. This has opened up a new path for maintaining world peace, especially peace in the Far East. Although some anti-armistice elements in the United States and the Syngman Rhee gang are frantically attempting to undermine the realization of the armistice, their conspiracies and provocations are bound to go bankrupt in the face of the people of the world.

The editorial concluded: The entire Korean people are determined to more resolutely launch a struggle to defend the freedom and independence of their motherland and to safeguard world peace.

    朝鲜“劳动新闻”评遣返战俘问题达成协议
    【新华社平壤十日电】朝鲜“劳动新闻”十日发表题为“我方始终如一的诚意和努力的果实”的社论说：由于我方作了不倦的和诚意的努力，朝鲜停战谈判双方已对阻碍朝鲜停战实现的遣返战俘问题达成完全的和最后的协议。协议的内容清楚地证明了我方方案的公正性。全世界所有爱好和平的人民，对于这个从板门店传来的消息，都表示热烈的支持和欢迎。朝鲜停战的日子就要到来了。
    社论指出：在迂回曲折的朝鲜停战谈判过程中，我方为争取和平所表示的坚定意志和所作的诚意的努力，对于今天全世界保卫和平的事业作了巨大的贡献。关于遣返战俘问题的完全达成协议，是对于企图继续朝鲜战争的好战分子的沉重打击。这已为维护全世界的和平特别是远东的和平，打开了新的道路。尽管美国某些反对停战的分子和李承晚匪帮正在疯狂地企图破坏停战的实现，但是，他们的阴谋和挑拨是一定要在全世界人民面前遭到破产的。
    社论最后说：全朝鲜人民决心更加坚决地展开保卫自己祖国自由、独立和维护世界和平的斗争。
