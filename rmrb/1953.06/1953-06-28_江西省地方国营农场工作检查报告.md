Report on the Inspection of Local State-Owned Farms in Jiangxi Province
Rural Work Department of the Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China

Over the past four years, farms in various special districts and counties in Jiangxi Province have played a certain role in breeding and promoting improved varieties of crops. Some farms have adopted and promoted some advanced cultivation techniques, and have also carried out some basic construction, exploring preliminary experience in the management of farms, which has laid a favorable foundation for future development. However, due to the lack of attention paid to local state-owned farms by leaders at all levels in the past, many farm leaders have an insufficient understanding of the nature of state-owned farms and the role they should play in agricultural production, and they also lack experience in farm work. Therefore, the problems existing in the management of local state-owned farms are still quite serious:

I. Unclear direction and tasks, with great blindness in business development: Many farm leaders do not understand the policy of establishing farms to improve technology, increase yields, create and promote advanced experiences, train modern agricultural cadres, and gradually guide farmers towards agricultural collectivization with the superiority of large-scale agriculture. Therefore, some farms have rented out most of their land; some farms have blindly engaged in diversified operations when conditions were not yet met. The farms in the Ji'an Special District have more than 200 mu of land, with more than 30 kinds of business projects. The No. 1 branch farm in Nanchang Special District has everything including farming, forestry, animal husbandry, horticulture, and special crops. The scale is large, the business scope is wide, and the strength is scattered, and the technology cannot keep up, causing many losses. In the operation of some farms, there is also a tendency towards capitalism, abandoning agriculture for sideline businesses, and doing whatever can make money. Dayu County Farm once made fish fry breeding and cured duck its main business. Fengcheng County Farm went to grow a large number of cabbages because the local vegetable prices were high. There are also farms that operate flowers, raise rabbits, burn kilns, dig coal, and press oil, etc. Some individual farms even lent cash for interest and occupied farmers' land in the expansion of the farm, which had a very bad impact on the masses. In terms of experiments, some cadres are divorced from reality and blindly mess around, such as grafting cotton onto willow trees in an attempt to make a "new discovery." These phenomena have seriously affected the normal development of farm business.

II. Poor management, chaotic systems, and disregard for profits and losses: Many farms have not yet gotten rid of the small-scale farming methods in their management. Most of the systems are unsound, and democratic management is often just a formality. Some production plans are just for show, and waste caused by blindly starting construction is also very common in basic construction.

In particular, the accounting systems of each farm are extremely unsound, and costs are generally not calculated. Many farm accountants do not understand the business and cannot carry out cost accounting. Many farms do not close their accounts for many years, and profits and losses cannot be calculated. In the No. 1 branch farm of Nanchang Special District, several accountants were replaced, but the predecessors could not clear the accounts, and the successors could not take over. They had to pack the account books, put on a seal, and put them on the shelf, leaving them unresolved. The farm workers ridiculed: "Even slow recording cannot be done, let alone quick recording (accounting)!"

In addition, the cost concept of farm leaders is extremely weak, and there is a relatively serious remnant of the supply system thinking, "only care about production, not about harvest"; "if there is no money, reach out to the superiors, and hand in all the grain harvested, and see if it is enough when the time comes!" Therefore, each farm has not yet truly established a cost accounting system. The cost of producing one jin of seed cotton in the No. 2 branch farm of Nanchang Special District is 4,800 yuan, but it only sells for 3,300 yuan on the market; the sales price of all cotton is not enough to cover the cost of one insecticide. The Xin'feng County Farm has to walk 35 li to carry manure into the city. Including wages and other items, the cost of one dan of manure is 18,000 yuan. The Ji'an Special District Farm hired more than 4,000 temporary workers in one year, hiring as many as needed, wasting 3,375 workdays. In this way, not only is the wealth of the country seriously lost, but also a bad influence is created among the masses. The farm's low yields, large wastes, and high costs do not help farmers summarize and promote high-yield experience, and it cannot play its due role as a demonstration. When farmers mention the farm, they say: "If you learn from the farm, your teeth will starve." Some even made allegros to ridicule the farm, "No rice seedlings are planted after the Dragon Boat Festival, and no harvest after the New Year. Asked what's good about the farm, the grass grows taller than the rice."

III. Too many cadres, poor quality, and lack of backbone: According to the actual needs of current production, the existing number of farm cadres is not small but redundant. The Nankang County Farm has only 320 mu of land, but it employs eight cadres, which far exceeds the number required for production. The quality of these cadres is not high, especially the lack of a strong leadership core. Therefore, some farms have formed a chaotic situation of "a flock of dragons without a leader, each doing his own thing." Many technical cadres have no practical production experience, and new agricultural science and technology are extremely lacking, so they are divorced from reality in production guidance. Last year, the Ji'an Special District Farm engaged in high-yield rice production. Although there were technical cadres, due to improper guidance and blindly harrowing and applying fertilizer, all the high-yield fields were blown down by the wind, and the "thousand-jin mu" only yielded more than 200 jin. In addition, the personnel department's allocation of cadres to the farm is also relatively chaotic, so the farm has to set up positions based on people, reluctantly arrange them, and get into a dilemma, and the work falls into passivity. Everyone reflects that the farm has become a "cadre shelter," "sanatorium," and there are often complaints such as "send the sick here, transfer them away when they are well, and bury them when they die." In short, the farm leadership is weak, and the cadre strength is not adapted to the requirements of the work; too many people with too little to do is also one of the reasons for the farm's large expenses and waste.

IV. Political work is very weak, and the enthusiasm of employees has not been fully mobilized: The farm rarely conducts regular political and ideological leadership for its employees. Therefore, many employees are demoralized, depressed, and the political atmosphere is weak. Various political movements rarely affect the farm, and the farm has become a so-called "dead corner of political movements." The workers have different degrees of mercenary views, "ringing the bell as it comes," and have a very poor sense of responsibility. Factionalism and disunity among employees are also frequently found, with so-called "local faction," "outsider faction," "new," "old," etc., forming sectarian views. The two work team leaders of the Ji'an Special District Farm were "incompatible as fire and water." Some technical cadres are divorced from politics, and some do not read newspapers all year round. Many cadres are also not convinced by each other. Administrative cadres look down on technical cadres, and technical cadres ignore administrative cadres, each doing his own thing and hindering each other. The workers regard the cadres as "exploiters" who eat for nothing and do nothing, and have an antagonistic sentiment towards the farm.

In order to improve the farm work, first of all, it is required that the Party committees and relevant government departments at all levels attach importance to the leadership of the state-owned farm work; those who have already begun to attach importance to this work in the past must further strengthen it in the future. The Party and government leading organs above the county level must put the farm work on their work agenda. It is necessary to appropriately adjust and strengthen the leading cadres of the farms; regularly study and review the production and work plans of the farms on a quarterly basis, make decisions, and put forward specific requirements and instructions; it is necessary to equip or appoint dedicated cadres to be responsible for the regular guidance of the farms, establish a system of inspection and reporting; it is necessary to strengthen the political and cultural education of farm employees, focus on ideological leadership, regularly provide political study materials to the farms, specifically deploy employee education work, and appropriately absorb farm employees to participate in certain local political activities; it is necessary to pay attention to cultivating and educating employee activists in the farms; and help the farms establish various systems such as democratic management and cost accounting.

Secondly, for the farms in various places, it is required to carry out a rectification in a planned and led manner. Among the employees, it is first necessary to launch a systematic class education, future education, democratic education, and education on the nature, direction, and tasks of the farm. Starting from summarizing the work, combine self-examination from top to bottom with criticism and exposure from bottom to top to conduct work inspections. On the one hand, affirm the past work achievements of the farm, and on the other hand, proceed from improving future work and fully expose all unreasonable phenomena in the farm's management; then, the farm leaders analyze and criticize the various problems exposed, put forward improvement opinions, carry out a rationalization proposal movement, carry out farm construction work, and establish and improve various systems, especially the regular democratic system.

Each farm must do its best to do a good job in production, and all work should be carried out around production. At present, the spring plowing, sowing, and rice transplanting work of each farm has come to an end. We should seize the opportunity to check the implementation of the production plan. If there are any inappropriate places, we should re-discuss and revise them from bottom to top to make the plan in line with reality. In the process of checking and revising the plan, we will once again educate the employees so that they recognize that an accurate production plan is the program of action for all employees of the farm, and then implement the production plan into practice and strive to victoriously complete the annual production task.

Each farm must closely contact the masses, improve the relationship between the farm and the masses, and demonstrate to the farmers with superior production results. Each farm must immediately overcome the phenomenon of running the farm behind closed doors and not interacting with the masses. For those with particularly bad relations with the masses, it is necessary to immediately and properly correct them in light of the causes of the problems. If individual personnel have caused dissatisfaction among the masses due to their style of work, they should be strengthened in education to make them establish a mass viewpoint, and they should conduct self-criticism and apologize to the masses; those who violate laws and discipline in serious circumstances should be given disciplinary sanctions or legal penalties. If the interests of the masses have been infringed upon in terms of land, water conservancy, and mountain forests, the farm should find ways to compensate or return the original items, and must conduct a public self-criticism. In order to further strengthen the connection between the farm and the masses, the farm must be ahead of the farmers in everything in production, set an example, and truly become a model for the masses to learn from. Each farm should further strengthen mass work, and gradually expand the improvement of the farm's production technology from near to far to the local farmers; and should establish regular contact with nearby farmers according to the possibility and need. Labor models, mutual aid team leaders, and production activists can be invited to establish an agricultural technology research association, hold seminars, exchange experiences, and study and improve technology; at the same time, absorb farmers' production experience, summarize and organize it, remove the dross and select the essence, and promote its rational parts. When the farm implements advanced cultivation methods, local people can be organized to visit the site and give explanations and introductions to the masses; some nearby mutual aid teams can be selected as bases, and technical guidance can be given to them regularly, and the effective cultivation methods of the farm can be promoted in these bases first on the principle of farmers' willingness, and then gradually expand the influence.

    江西省地方国营农场工作检查报告
    中共江西省委农村工作部
    四年来，江西省各专区、县农场，在繁育推广良种方面起了一定作用，部分农场采用并推广了一些先进耕作技术，同时也进行了一些基本建设，摸索出了经营管理农场的初步经验，给今后的发展打下了有利基础。但是，由于过去各级领导机关对于地方国营农场的重视不够，许多农场领导干部对国营农场的性质、及其在农业生产上所应起的作用认识不足，而且缺乏农场工作经验，所以地方国营农场在经营管理等方面所存在的问题还是相当严重的：
    一、方针任务不明确，经营发展上有很大的盲目性：许多农场领导干部对建立农场是为了改进技术、提高产量、创造和推广先进经验、培养近代化农业的干部并以大农业的优越性逐渐引导农民将来走向农业集体化的方针不了解。因此，有的农场曾把大部分土地出租；有的农场在条件并不具备时盲目搞多种经营。吉安专区农场有二百多亩土地，经营项目即达三十余种。南昌专区农场一分场农林、畜牧、园艺、特种作物样样俱全，摊子摆得大，经营范围广，力量分散，技术赶不上，造成许多损失。在某些农场的经营上，还存在资本主义倾向，抛开农业搞副业，什么能赚钱经营什么。大庾县农场即曾以养鱼苗、搞板鸭为其主要业务。丰城县农场因当地菜价高，而去大量种植包心菜。还有的农场经营花卉、养兔子、烧窑、挖炭、榨油等等。甚至有个别农场以现金放债吃息，在扩大农场中侵占了农民的土地，在群众中影响极坏。在试验方面，有的干部脱离实际，盲目乱来，像把棉花接到柳树上企图有所“新发现”等。这些现象都严重地影响了农场业务的正常开展。
    二、经营管理不善，制度紊乱，不计盈亏：不少农场经营管理上还未摆脱小农经营方式。制度多不健全，民主管理有许多是有名无实，生产计划有的流于形式，在基本建设方面因盲目兴工造成浪费的也很普遍。
    特别是各场会计制度极不健全，普遍的不计成本。很多农场的会计不懂业务，无从进行成本核算。不少农场常年不结账，盈亏算不出。南昌专区农场一分场换了几个会计都是前任交不清、后任接不上，只好把帐本一包，贴上封条，束之高阁，不了了之。农场工人讥讽地说：“慢记都记不上，还快记（会计）呢！”
    此外，农场领导干部的成本观念异常薄弱，有较严重的供给制思想的残余，“只顾生产，不问收获”；“没钱伸手向上边要，收了谷子一伙交，够不够到时候看！”因此，至今各场尚未真正建立起来成本核算制度。南昌专区农场二分场生产一斤籽棉的成本是四千八百元，而市场只售三千三百元；全部棉花的售价不够一项杀虫药费开支。信丰县农场进城挑粪要走三十五里，算上工资等项，一担大粪成本合一万八千元。吉安专区农场一年请零工四千多个，来多少要多少，浪费了三千三百七十五个工。这样，不仅严重地损失了国家的财富，而且在群众中造成不良的影响。农场的产量低、浪费大、成本高，也不去帮助农民总结和推广丰产经验，不能起它应起的示范作用。农民提起来农场就说：“向农场学习，牙都会饿掉。”甚至编成快板，讥讽农场“端午过了未栽禾，过了新年未收割，问道农场那里好，青草长得比禾高”。
    三、干部数量多、质量差、缺乏骨干：根据目前生产的实际需要，现有农场干部在数量上不是少而是多余。南康县农场只有三百二十亩土地，就用了八个干部，远超过生产上所必需的数目。这些干部质量都不高，尤其缺乏坚强的领导核心。因此，一些农场形成“群龙无首，各行其是”的混乱局面。许多技术干部没有实际生产经验，新的农业科学技术也极为贫乏，因此在生产指导上脱离实际。吉安专区农场去年搞水稻丰产，虽有技术干部，但因指导不当，盲目多耙多施肥，结果全部丰产田青风倒伏，“千斤亩”只收了二百多斤。此外，人事部门给农场配备干部的情况也较为混乱，使农场不能不因人设事，勉强安置，左右为难，工作陷于被动。大家反映农场成了“干部收容所”、“疗养院”，常有“有病派来、病好调走、死了安葬”等怨言。总之，农场领导薄弱，干部力量和工作的要求很不适应；事少人多，也是使农场开支大、浪费多的原因之一。
    四、政治工作十分薄弱，职工积极性未能充分发挥起来：农场很少对职工进行经常的政治思想领导，因此，不少职工情绪涣散、意志消沉，政治空气薄弱。各种政治运动很少波及农场，农场成了所谓“政治运动的死角”。工人中程度不同地存在着雇佣观点，“当天和尚撞天钟”，工作责任心很差。职工中间闹宗派不团结的现象也屡有发现，有所谓“本地派”、“外来派”、“新的”、“老的”等等，形成门户之见。吉安专区农场两个工作组长闹得“水火不相容”。某些技术干部脱离政治，有的常年不看报纸。许多干部之间也是互不服气，行政干部看不起技术干部，技术干部也不睬行政干部，各行其是，互相掣肘。工人把干部看作白吃饭不作事的“剥削者”，与农场有对立情绪。
                 ×　×　×
    为了改进农场工作，首先要求各级党委和政府有关部门重视对国营农场工作的领导；过去已开始重视这项工作的，今后仍须进一步加强。县以上党政领导机关，必须把农场工作提到自己的工作日程上来。要适当调整加强农场的领导干部；按生产季度定期研究审查农场的生产和工作计划，作出决定，提出具体要求和指示；要配备或指定专责干部担任农场的经常指导工作，建立检查与汇报制度；要加强对农场职工进行政治、文化教育，抓紧思想领导，经常供给农场政治学习材料，具体部署职工教育工作，适当地吸收农场职工参加当地一定的政治活动；要在农场中注意培养教育职工积极分子；帮助农场建立民主管理、成本核算等各项制度。
    其次，对于各地农场，要求有计划、有领导地进行一番整顿。在职工中，首先要展开系统的阶级教育、前途教育、民主教育和农场的性质和方针任务的教育。要从总结工作入手，自上而下检讨与自下而上批评揭发相结合，进行工作检查。一方面肯定农场过去的工作成绩，一方面从改进今后工作出发，充分揭发农场经营管理上的一切不合理现象；然后，农场领导干部分析批判所暴露出的各种问题，提出改进意见，开展合理化建议运动，进行农场建设工作，建立与健全各种制度，特别是经常的民主制度。
    各个农场必须以全力搞好生产，一切工作皆应围绕生产去进行。目前各场春耕、播种、莳田工作已告一段落，应抓紧时机检查生产计划执行情况，有不妥当的地方，要重新自下而上地加以讨论修订，使计划符合实际。在检查修订计划中再一次教育职工，使他们认识准确的生产计划乃是全场职工的行动纲领，然后，再把生产计划贯彻到实际中去，争取胜利地完成全年生产任务。
    各场都要密切联系群众，改善农场和群众的关系，以优越的生产成果对农民群众进行示范。各场要立即克服那些关门办农场、与群众不相往来的现象。与群众关系十分恶劣的，要针对发生问题的原因，立即妥善地予以纠正。如有个别人员因作风问题引起群众不满的，要加强教育，使他树立群众观点，并要他在群众中进行检讨道歉；对个别违法乱纪情节严重的，应给予纪律处分或法律制裁。如有在土地、水利、山林等方面侵犯群众利益的，农场应设法予以补偿或原物退回，并须进行公开检讨。为进一步加强农场与群众的联系，农场在生产上要事事走在农民前面，树立榜样，真正成为群众学习的楷模。各场并应进一步加强群众工作，将农场生产技术上的改进，由近而远，向当地农民逐步扩大地传播；并应根据可能和需要，与附近农民建立经常的联系。可以邀请劳动模范、互助组长、生产积极分子成立农业技术研究会，召开座谈会，互相交流经验，研究改进技术；同时，吸收农民生产经验，加以总结整理，去粗求精，发扬其合理部分，加以推广。在农场实行先进耕作方法时，可以组织当地群众实地参观，给群众讲解介绍；可以选择附近一些互助组为基点，经常予以技术指导，把农场行之有效的耕作方法，在农民自愿的原则下先在这些基点中推行，然后逐步扩大影响。
