Xinhua News Agency, London, June 10th: The Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference, which opened in London on June 3rd, concluded on the 9th.

The communiqué issued after the conference, regarding the entire meeting, stated that during the conference, the Commonwealth Prime Ministers discussed relations with the Soviet Union and unanimously agreed that "no opportunity should be missed to mediate or at least ease the current divisions that divide the world," but that "democratic countries (referring to capitalist countries) must maintain their strength."

The communiqué stated: The Prime Ministers closely followed the final stages of the Korean armistice negotiations. They noted "with satisfaction" that an agreement on the repatriation of prisoners of war had finally been concluded, "paving the way for an early signing of an armistice agreement." They also exchanged views on the Far East and Southeast Asia issues after the end of the Korean War.

The Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference also discussed the issues of Europe and the Middle East, including the establishment of a "European Defense Community."

Regarding the economic issues, for which alternative solutions had to be sought due to the United States' refusal to "cooperate" on the "revival" of the Commonwealth economic plan passed at the Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference at the end of November and beginning of December last year, the Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference held a special discussion on the last day of the meeting. Regarding this issue, the communiqué stated that the Prime Ministers unanimously agreed that "the economic strength of the countries concerned needs to be further strengthened," especially "the need to stimulate economic development to expand exports and always maintain sufficient reserves, and to gradually remove trade restrictions in the widest possible area—especially the Commonwealth and the Sterling Area."

    英联邦总理会议闭幕发表公报
    认为应不错过调解目前世界分歧的机会
    【新华社十日讯】伦敦消息：六月三日在伦敦召开的英联邦总理会议已于九日闭幕。
    会议结束后发表的关于整个会议的公报说，在会议上，联邦总理们讨论了对苏联的关系，一致认为“应不错过任何机会调解或至少缓和目前分裂世界的分歧”，但“民主国家（指资本主义国家）必须保持实力”。
    公报说：总理们密切注意朝鲜停战谈判的结束阶段。他们“满意地”指出，遣返战俘的协议终于缔结，“这为及早签订停战协定铺平了道路”。他们并就朝鲜战事终止后的远东及东南亚问题交换了意见。
    联邦总理会议还讨论了欧洲和中东的问题，包括建立“欧洲防务集团”问题。
    关于因美国拒绝在去年十一月底十二月初英联邦总理会议通过的“复兴”英联邦经济计划上“合作”而不得不另谋解决办法的经济问题，联邦总理会议在最后一天会议上曾作了专门的讨论。关于这个问题，公报说，总理们一致认为“需继续加强有关国家的经济力量”，特别是“需要刺激经济发展以扩大输出并始终保持足够储备，在尽可能广泛的区域——特别是联邦和英镑区——内逐步取消贸易限制”。
