Xinhua News Agency reports: Most of the wheat in the Yangtze River Basin and southern provinces has had a bumper harvest this year. Guangdong, Fujian, Guangxi, Yunnan, Sichuan and other provinces have successively completed wheat harvesting, while Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Hunan, Hubei, Anhui, Jiangsu and other provinces began harvesting in mid-to-late May. The wheat harvest situation in these areas is as follows: Fujian and Zhejiang provinces have increased production by more than 10% compared to last year; Sichuan Province has increased production by 10% compared to last year; Yunnan, Guangxi and Guangdong provinces have mostly had good harvests, with Zhaotong and Qujing regions in Yunnan Province increasing production by 10% to 30% compared to last year; Guilin region in Guangxi Province averaged 100 to 120 catties per mu, with good yields reaching over 150 catties; Yuezhong district in Guangdong Province averaged 100 catties per mu, while other regions averaged 70 to 80 catties per mu; Jiangxi Province averaged 100 catties per mu, slightly higher than last year; Hubei Province, except for a few areas affected by hail, insects, and drought, the main wheat-producing areas of Wuchang, Echeng, Mianyang, Songzi and other counties have increased production by 20% to 30% compared to last year; some areas of Anhui and Jiangsu provinces have suffered from cold waves, late frosts and other disasters, but after rescue efforts, they still retain a certain harvest. In Anhui Province, Suxian and Fuyang regions generally yield 40 catties per mu, with better areas still yielding over 100 catties; in Jiangsu Province, Songjiang and Suzhou regions wheat harvests may exceed planned targets, with Jiading County averaging 115 catties per mu last year, and farmers reporting a potential yield of 150 catties this year.

The wheat in the fourteen local state-owned farms affiliated to Xinxiang Region in Henan Province has grown well despite frost damage, due to attention to technical management and reasonable implementation of close planting after rescue. It is estimated that the highest yield in high-yielding areas can reach 700 to 800 catties per mu, and the yield in general areas can also increase by 30% compared to last year. In order to exchange the experience of wheat bumper harvests in various farms, the Xinxiang Prefectural Commissioner's Office organized a bumper harvest visiting group including representatives of farm workers, famous agricultural labor models, and representatives of agricultural producers' cooperatives to visit Baiquan, Jiaozuo and other farms.

[Xinhua News Agency, 31st dispatch] Cotton sowing has basically been completed throughout the country, and the cotton seedling growth is generally good. In Shaanxi, Shanxi and other provinces where sowing was earlier, the cotton seedlings are already two or three inches high. Currently, cotton farmers are engaged in replanting, thinning, weeding, and other tasks. Aphids and other pests have begun to occur in some areas. The Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government has recently notified all regions to prevent and eliminate pests as early as possible in order to strive for a bumper cotton harvest in autumn.

In order to increase cotton yield per unit area, cotton farmers in various regions have vigorously improved cotton field cultivation techniques this year under the leadership and assistance of the People's Government. During spring plowing and sowing, governments at all levels in the southern cotton-producing areas of Shanxi Province dispatched a large number of technical cadres to teach advanced cultivation techniques to farmers, with more than 140,000 farmers directly receiving instruction. Under the leadership of these 140,000 people, local cotton farmers implemented shallow plowing and multiple harrowing methods to conserve moisture in 80% of cotton fields. Cotton field cultivation techniques in Jiangsu Province this year are also much more detailed than in the past. In Sheyang County, over 500,000 mu of cotton fields were generally plowed once or twice before sowing, and 10% more base fertilizer was applied than last year. In Hebei Province, approximately 500 to 1,500 catties more coarse fertilizer per mu of cotton field was applied than last year. In Xinxiang Region, Henan Province, base fertilizer was applied to 80% of the land last year, and this year all land was fertilized. Governments at all levels, state-owned economic departments and supply and marketing cooperatives have promptly supplied fertilizer to cotton-growing areas, which has boosted the production enthusiasm of cotton farmers. The original plan was to supply 100,000 catties of granular calcium phosphate fertilizer to the southern region of Shanxi Province, but the plan was exceeded by 41%. In Hebei Province, as of May 15th, 443 million catties of soybean cake, cottonseed cake and other products had been sold. Cotton farmers in various regions have generally adopted excellent varieties and implemented appropriate close planting. In Luoyang, Xinxiang, Anyang, Zhengzhou, Nanyang, Shangqiu and other regions of Henan Province, tens of thousands of mu of cotton fields in six cotton demonstration zones have all adopted excellent varieties, and have soaked and mixed the seeds, achieving close planting of 2,500 to 3,000 plants per mu. In the Guanzhong area of Shaanxi Province, more than 80% of cotton farmers have selected cotton seeds by grain, and have exposed them to the sun two to three times; some have also used warm water soaking and "Ceresan" seed mixing. In Dezhou Region, Shandong Province, 70% of cotton farmers have adopted the "S-character Wu'ai Cotton" and "S-character Erbi Cotton" improved varieties, and many cotton farmers have also applied the advanced experience of "wide ridges and close planting." In Jie County, Shanxi Province, more than 80% of cotton farmers have adopted the Soviet advanced "timed and temperature-controlled" seed soaking and mixing method.

    长江流域、南方各省小麦大部丰收
    各地棉花播种基本结束、棉苗生长良好
    据新华社讯：长江流域和南方各省今年小麦大部丰收。广东、福建、广西、云南、四川等省小麦已先后收割完毕，浙江、江西、湖南、湖北、安徽、江苏等省从五月中旬或下旬开始收割。这些地区的小麦收成情况是：福建、浙江两省都比去年增产一成以上；四川省比去年增产一成；云南、广西、广东三省大部收成良好，云南省昭通、曲靖两专区比去年增产一成到三成；广西省桂林专区平均每亩收一百斤到一百二十斤，好的收一百五十斤以上；广东省粤中区平均每亩收一百斤，其他地区平均每亩收七八十斤；江西省平均每亩可收一百斤，比去年略有增加；湖北省除少数地区遭受雹、虫、旱等灾害外，主要产麦区武昌、鄂城、沔阳、松滋等县都比去年增产二成到三成；安徽、江苏两省部分地区遭受寒流、晚霜等灾害，经过抢救后还保有一定的收成，安徽省宿县、阜阳两专区一般每亩可收四十斤，较好的仍可收一百斤以上，江苏省松江、苏州两专区小麦收成可能超过预定计划，嘉定县去年平均每亩收一百十五斤，今年据农民反映可收一百五十斤。
    河南省新乡专区所属的十四个地方国营农场的小麦，由于注意技术管理，合理地实行了密植，虽然遭受霜灾，但经抢救后，生长仍然良好。据估计：丰产地最高产量，每亩可收七、八百斤，一般地的产量也可比去年增产三成。为了交流各个农场的小麦丰产经验，新乡专署组织了一个包括各农场职工代表、著名农业劳动模范、农业生产合作社代表的丰产参观团，到百泉、焦作等农场参观。
    【新华社三十一日讯】全国各地棉花播种工作已基本结束，棉苗生长情况一般良好。播种较早的陕西、山西等省，棉苗已有二三寸高。目前各地种棉农民正在进行补苗、间苗、锄草等工作。部分地区开始发生棉蚜等虫害，中央人民政府农业部最近已通知各地及早防治和扑灭虫害，争取秋季棉花丰收。
    为了提高棉花单位面积产量，今年各地种棉农民在人民政府的领导和扶助下，都大力改进棉田耕作技术。山西省南部棉产区各级人民政府在春耕播种中，曾派出大批技术干部向农民传授先进耕作技术，直接听取传授的农民有十四万多人。在这十四万多人的带头下，当地种棉农民在百分之八十的棉田中实行了浅耕和多耙耱的保墒办法。江苏省今年棉田耕作技术也都比过去细致得多，射阳县五十多万亩棉田在播种前普遍耕了一遍到两遍，所施基肥比去年多百分之十。河北省每亩棉田约比去年增施粗肥五百斤到一千五百斤左右。河南省新乡专区棉区去年施基肥的土地面积是百分之八十，今年全部土地施了基肥。各级人民政府、国营经济部门和供销合作社对棉区及时供应肥料，鼓舞了种棉农民的生产热情。山西省南部地区原计划供应十万斤颗粒状磷酸钙肥料，结果超过计划百分之四十一。河北省截至五月十五日止，已销出豆饼、棉籽饼等四亿四千三百万斤。各地种棉农民普遍采用优良品种，并实行适当的密植。河南省洛阳、新乡、安阳、郑州、南阳、商邱等专区，六个棉花示范区的数万亩棉田全部采用了优良品种，并作到浸种、拌种，每亩密植二千五百株到三千株。陕西省关中地区百分之八十以上的种棉农民都粒选了棉籽，并曝晒了两次到三次，有的还使用温汤浸种和使用“赛力散”拌种。山东省德州专区种棉农民有百分之七十采用了“斯字五爱棉”和“斯字二比棉”良种，很多种棉农民还运用了“宽垄密植”的先进经验。山西省解县百分之八十以上的种棉农民采用了苏联的“定时定温”先进浸种拌种法。
