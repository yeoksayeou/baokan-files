Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, June 17th: The Korean Armistice Negotiation Korean-Chinese delegation issued the following communique on June 17th:

　　On June 17th, the both sides delegation held an administrative meeting. After the meeting, the two sides’ staff officers and liaison officers continued to hold meetings.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, June 17th, our special correspondent Wu Min reported: The delegation held a secret meeting this morning, lasting twenty-two minutes. The details of the meeting were not released. However, all indications suggest that this meeting has completed another important step towards signing the armistice agreement. The delegation adjourned six days ago, to be reconvened when the staff officers' talks progressed to the point where it was necessary.

　　The delegation's meeting today, after significant progress was made by the staff officers and their assistants working with maps, indicates that the work of revising the military demarcation line to fit the current battle line has reached its climax.

　　These staff officers worked with maps until 5:00 PM yesterday before adjourning. Staff assistants worked with glass-covered tools for drawing lines on maps. They worked until almost midnight.

　　Then, the staff officers of both sides held a meeting lasting only seven minutes, during which they could be seen working with maps in the brightly lit conference room.

　　This very busy work situation shows that the work of determining the military demarcation line on the map was to be completed in time for the delegation's meeting this morning.

　　In the past, the delegations of both sides have held meetings to approve the military demarcation line drawn on the map in November 1951. At that time, both sides agreed that if the armistice agreement was not signed within thirty days, then this demarcation line would be revised according to changes in the battle line. This demarcation of the military demarcation line means that this agreed line will be an armistice line, and twelve hours after the armistice agreement is signed, the war along this line will cease.

　　In 1951, after the delegations of both sides approved the demarcated military demarcation line, the staff officers of both sides drew the northern and southern edges of the demilitarized zone on the map. This morning, after the delegation adjourned, the staff officers of both sides carrying maps immediately continued their meeting in the conference room.

　　The fact that the delegations of both sides adjourned shortly after meeting today, and did not set a date for another meeting, is another indication that the preparations for signing the armistice agreement are proceeding smoothly. All these indications show that the U.S. propaganda reports of delays in the agreement to revise the military demarcation line are completely unfounded.

　　Another indication confirming that the armistice negotiations are progressing rapidly towards signing is that the liaison officers of both sides inspected the site together at around 7:00 PM yesterday after the meeting. They could be seen inspecting the open space behind the conference room while holding a secret conversation, possibly to decide on the location for the signing ceremony.

### 朝鲜谈判双方代表团举行行政性会议

    朝鲜谈判双方代表团举行行政性会议
    【新华社开城十七日电】朝鲜停战谈判朝中代表团六月十七日发表公报如下：
    六月十七日，双方代表团大会举行了行政性会议。大会后，双方两组参谋人员和双方联络官继续举行了会议。
    【新华社开城十七日电】本社特派记者吴敏报道：代表团大会今晨举行秘密会议，历时二十二分钟，会议进行情况没有发表。但是，一切迹象都说明，这次会议已完成了走向签订停战协定的另一个重要步骤。代表团大会在六天前休会，直到参谋人员会谈进行到需要恢复代表团大会的时候再举行。
    在参谋人员和他们的助理人员带着地图工作有了显著的进展之后，今天代表团大会复会，这说明修正军事分界线适合目前战线的工作已经进行到了最高点。
    这些参谋人员昨天对着地图一直工作到下午五点钟才休会，由参谋助理人员带着有玻璃盖的、供在地图上划线之用的器具工作。他们一直工作到差不多午夜。
    然后双方参谋人员举行了历时仅七分钟的会议，从外面可以看到他们在灯光明亮的会议室中对着地图工作。
    这种工作非常繁忙的情况，说明在地图上确定军事分界线的工作，要在今晨代表团大会开会之前及时完成。
    在过去，双方代表团曾举行会议批准一九五一年十一月在地图上划定的军事分界线。当时双方同意：如果在三十天以内，这个停战协定还没有签字的话，那末这条划定的线将依照战线的变动而加以修改。这次军事分界线的划定，意味着这条业经商定的线将是一条停战线，停战协定签字之后十二小时，沿这一条线的战事就将停止。
    一九五一年，在双方代表团批准划定了的军事分界线之后，双方参谋人员曾在地图上划出了非军事区的北缘和南缘。今天早晨，在代表团大会休会之后，携带地图的双方参谋人员立即继续在会议室中开会。
    双方代表团今天开会不久就休会，并且没有规定另一次会议的日期，这是另一个迹象，显示停战协定的签字准备工作进行得很顺利。所有这些迹象，都说明美方的宣传所谓修改军事分界线的协议受到延迟的报道是毫无事实根据的。
    证实停战谈判正向签字方向疾进的另一个迹象，是双方联络官员昨天开会后在下午七点左右曾一起视察地址。人们可以看见他们一面在进行密谈，一面在视察会议室后面的空地，可能是在决定举行签字仪式的地址。
