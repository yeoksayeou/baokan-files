　　Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, June 21st: TASS, Berlin, June 20th: The German News Agency reports that the 50 million US dollars entrusted to West Berlin Mayor Reuter, supposedly to further strengthen West German economy, will be handed over to terrorist organizations such as the "Kampfgruppe gegen Unmenschlichkeit" (Fighting Group Against Inhumanity), the German Youth League, and the fascist German Party. These organizations have exhausted their funds due to the large sums spent on subsidizing spies who carry out provocative activities in the democratic districts of Berlin.

    美国以巨款供给西德特务
    【新华社二十一日讯】塔斯社柏林二十日讯：德意志通讯社报道，美国交由西柏林市长鲁特支配的、据说是用来进一步加强西德经济的五千万美元，就要移交给像反对非人道主义斗争团、德国青年联盟和法西斯的德意志党这样的一些恐怖组织去使用。由于拿出了很多钱资助在柏林民主区进行挑衅活动的特务，这些组织的经费已经用尽了。
