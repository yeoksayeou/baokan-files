Dear Sisters and Friends!

    The Chinese delegation listened with boundless excitement to Mrs. Gordon's report. She told us of the glorious achievements of the Women's International Democratic Federation (WIDF), and she also told us how women all over the world are fighting heroically for peace and to protect children. At the same time, she clearly pointed out the direction for women all over the world to strive for peace and to protect children in the future. We salute the sisters all over the world who defend peace! We offer even more respect to the WIDF, the shining banner of women all over the world, which leads the world's women's peace movement.

    We Chinese women are honored to be a component of the world's women defending peace under the banner of the WIDF. This is because we have suffered the disasters of wars of aggression for a long time—the war of Japanese militarism's aggression against China alone caused us to lose more than ten million lives. How many white-haired mothers lost their sons, and how many young wives lost their husbands. Our pain is endless. However, we Chinese women were not overwhelmed by grief. In order to win and defend peace, we fought tenaciously with the men, and finally defeated the foreign invaders and achieved national independence and domestic peace. How can we not love and cherish this peace, which was exchanged for blood and life? We long to heal the wounds of war in peace; we long to build our country in peace, so that all our people can enjoy a good life and all our children can have a happy future. Our government and people are advancing according to the above wishes.

    As soon as the war ended, all our people immediately devoted themselves to intensive labor to restore the economy that had been destroyed by the war. The traces of the war quickly disappeared from our cities and villages. In just three years, our industrial and agricultural production not only fully recovered, but also generally exceeded the highest levels in our history. The dilapidated factories and machines of the past have been repaired, new factories have appeared, and many industrial and technical equipment that did not exist before are now available. On the vast land liberated from feudal shackles, the yield of various crops has increased year by year. In 1952, the national grain output reached 163.75 million tons, exceeding the highest output in history. In the same year, the national cotton output reached 1.29 million tons, nearly twice the output in 1949, and about 50 percent higher than the highest annual output in history.

    At the same time, we also carried out large-scale water conservancy projects. Silted rivers have been dredged, and strong flood-control dikes, reservoirs, and sluice gates have been built. New cities and villages have appeared in areas that used to suffer from floods every year. In the past three years, the amount of earthwork we have excavated in water conservancy projects has been 22 times more than that excavated when the Suez Canal was built.

    Our railway lines are extending day by day. In 1952 alone, 472 kilometers of new railway lines were built and 602 kilometers of railway lines were repaired.

    With the recovery and development of industrial and agricultural production and transportation, our domestic and foreign trade is also becoming increasingly active. The national fiscal revenue and expenditure have been balanced, prices have been stabilized, and the material and cultural life of the people has been significantly improved. On this basis, our country has started its first five-year construction plan this year.

    In the past three and a half years, our country has achieved great success in peaceful construction. In the meantime, the hard work of Chinese women has played a considerable role. The number of female workers participating in industrial construction is increasing year by year. With great enthusiasm, they participate in patriotic production competitions, give full play to their creativity and initiative, and become an important force in industrial construction. Taking the textile industry, where female workers account for 60 percent of the total workers, as an example, the output of cotton yarn in 1952 exceeded the highest annual output in history by 51.1 percent, and cotton cloth exceeded 64.8 percent. This achievement is inseparable from the efforts of female textile workers. Hao Jianxiu, a young female spinner, is an outstanding example of female workers in our country. By actively studying technology and being good at concentrating the wisdom of the masses, she created a set of scientific spinning methods. The creation and promotion of this new method is a major achievement in our textile industry. In 1952, more than 20,000 outstanding Hao Jianxiu workers emerged across the country, increasing the quantity and quality of textiles and reducing costs, saving a lot of wealth for the country. In response to the country's call to "focus on heavy industry in industrial construction," many women have participated in production sectors that no women had ever participated in before. Now, whether it is next to steelmaking furnaces, in machine shops, foundries, electrical rooms, laboratories, docks, or on railways, women can be seen working skillfully, serving the country's construction cause. Many advanced workers have emerged among them. For example, Gong Zhaozhi, a technician at the design department of Anshan Iron and Steel Company, personally succeeded in experiments and improved a certain pipeline device, saving the country a wealth of 4 billion yuan. In water conservancy projects, even more laboring women participated; there were 300,000 female laborers participating in the Huai River control and Jingjiang flood diversion projects alone. The participation of vast numbers of rural women in agricultural production has played an even greater role in the restoration and development of national agricultural production.

    Chinese women have been able to play such a significant role because of the efforts made by the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, which leads the national women's movement, in actively mobilizing, organizing, and educating the masses of women. The victory of the Chinese people has created favorable political conditions for carrying out the women's movement. Therefore, with the advent of liberation, a unified women's movement, which is broad in scale and deeply rooted in women of all strata, has unfolded vigorously throughout the country. In just over three years, women of all nationalities and strata in China have been united and organized under the leadership of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, whether in cities or villages. Chinese women's organizations, like the Chinese workers' and youth organizations, have become a powerful force for consolidating the people's democratic power, building the motherland, and safeguarding the motherland's security and peace. They have become schools for women to seek progress, improve their culture, and cultivate their working skills, and have become banners for defending women's rights and seeking welfare for women and children. This is a fact that was unanimously recognized at the Second National Women's Congress of China held in April this year when summarizing the achievements of the past four years.

    Here we deeply realize that the rapid development of the Chinese women's movement, like the rapid development of China's peaceful construction, is inseparable from our country's people's democratic system and our country's firm policy of peace. This can also be seen from our country's budget. In our country's 1953 national budget, 59.24 percent was used for national economic construction and social and cultural construction, while our national defense expenditure, even under the conditions of our national people's efforts to resist America and aid Korea, only accounted for a little over 22 percent of the total expenditure. This is a clear contrast to the United States, where direct military spending accounted for 74 percent of total spending in the 1952-1953 fiscal year budget.

    The peace aspirations of our country's women are not only expressed in their active participation in the peaceful construction of the motherland, but also clearly expressed in our enthusiastic participation in the international peace movement. The women of our country have warmly responded to all the calls of the Women's International Democratic Federation and the World Peace Council and have resolutely implemented all their resolutions. 340 million people in our country have signed the declaration requesting the conclusion of a Five-Power Peace Pact, of which women account for about half. Our country's women welcomed the Asian Women's Conference held in Beijing with unparalleled enthusiasm, and did everything possible to serve the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference. We have constantly welcomed sisters from various countries to visit our country, and sent representatives to participate in all the meetings convened by the Women's International Democratic Federation and the World Peace Council. In November 1951, we responded to the call of the preparatory committee of the International Conference for the Defence of Children and formed the Chinese People's National Committee for the Defence of Children. This committee has played a significant role in promoting national child care and education work.

    The women of our country have expressed great respect and concern for the heroic fighting Korean sisters, and women from all walks of life have enthusiastically contributed their labor income and most beloved things to support the women and people of Korea. We have taken in more than 20,000 Korean orphans who lost their parents in the war, established schools and childcare facilities for them, and specially hired Korean teachers for them.

    In order to peacefully resolve the Korean issue, we have been conducting armistice negotiations with the United States since July 1951. During the year-long negotiations, we have always shown great patience and put forward various fair and reasonable proposals, so that 63 articles of the draft armistice agreement have reached an agreement, and only the issue of prisoners of war is hindering the realization of the armistice. In March of this year, in order to adhere to the consistent proposition of peacefully resolving the Korean issue and to satisfy the world people's desire for peace, the Korean-Chinese side took further actions to solve the only remaining prisoner-of-war issue to promote the Korean armistice. After Marshal Kim Il Sung and General Peng Dehuai sent a letter to the US side's General Clark on March 28th, expressing their agreement with General Clark's suggestion in his letter of February 22nd to first exchange sick and wounded prisoners of war during the war, the Chinese government and the Korean government successively issued statements on March 30th and March 31st, advocating that the negotiators of the warring parties should immediately begin negotiations on the issue of first exchanging sick and wounded prisoners of war during the war, and then seek a smooth solution to the entire prisoner-of-war issue. At the same time, the two governments jointly suggested that the negotiating parties should guarantee the immediate repatriation of prisoners of war who insist on repatriation after the armistice, and transfer the remaining prisoners of war to neutral countries to ensure a fair solution to their repatriation issues. Now, on the basis of this joint proposal, the Korean armistice negotiations have been restored. The Korean-Chinese side has made obvious concessions in the steps, time, and method of repatriating prisoners of war, and has successively put forward two reasonable plans for a fair solution to the issue of prisoner-of-war repatriation. The US side once put forward a so-called counter-proposal that would damage the basis of the negotiations agreed by both sides, but due to the firm opposition of the world people and the major pressure of world opinion, and due to the firm efforts of the Korean-Chinese side, the negotiations were able to proceed along the normal path. The delegations of both sides of the Korean armistice negotiations reached an agreement on the issue of prisoner-of-war repatriation in Panmunjom on June 8, 1953, so that the entire prisoner-of-war issue could be resolved. We Chinese women believe that the resolution of the prisoner-of-war issue must promote the realization of the Korean armistice. In this way, it will pave the way for the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, thereby preparing the conditions for the peaceful resolution of the Far East issue. Therefore, we warmly support this new effort made by our government and the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to end the Korean War, and believe that it fully conforms to the vital interests of the people on both sides who have children fighting in Korea, and also fully conforms to the fundamental interests of the people of the world. It will inevitably be welcomed by all people who sincerely hope for peace in the world, especially the mothers and wives on both sides who have their children and husbands fighting in Korea.

    Now is a major opportunity to achieve a Korean armistice and seek peace in Korea. The people of the world have a responsibility to urge the US government not to let this opportunity pass in vain with the sincerity of seeking peace in Korea.

    We also demand that the issues of Vietnam and Malaya be resolved peacefully in the spirit of consultation, and that the independence and sovereignty of the countries concerned be unconditionally respected.

    We Chinese women, like all peace-loving women in the world, especially Japanese women, resolutely oppose the revival of Japanese militarism. We advocate that Japan conclude peace treaties with all relevant countries so that Japan can become a peaceful, democratic, and free country. We support the German people in opposing foreign military occupation, and believe that rearming West Germany will constitute a serious threat to world peace. The German people should have the right to conclude peace treaties with all relevant countries and establish a unified, peaceful, democratic, and free Germany.

    The desire for national independence of the people of all countries must be respected. We oppose the phenomenon of one country threatening the security of another country, and oppose a country maintaining military bases and stationing troops on the territory of another country.

    We demand the reduction of armaments and the use of funds for war preparations to increase social welfare and protect mothers and infants.

    We firmly believe that countries with different social systems can coexist peacefully, and that no international disputes cannot be resolved through peaceful consultation. We advocate developing official contacts between countries, opposing all policies of blockade and embargo, and speeding up the restoration and strengthening of material and cultural exchanges between countries to promote the prosperity of the world, Asian economy and culture.

    We Chinese women warmly support the proposition of the World People's Peace Congress and demand that the United States, the Soviet Union, China, the United Kingdom, and France immediately begin consultations and conclude a Five-Power Peace Pact!

    After the International Committee of the World People's Peace Congress submitted the proposal to request the five major powers to conclude a peace pact to the governments of the five major powers, the Soviet Union and our government have officially replied, supporting this proposal, and are ready to cooperate with the governments of other countries at any time to achieve the lofty goal of maintaining international peace and consolidating international security. We believe that women all over the world, especially women in the United States, Britain, and France, will assume their noble responsibilities and urge the governments of the United States, Britain, and France to adopt the same attitude.

    Dear friends, we women, we mothers, have already done a lot of work and have achieved many achievements in order to defend peace and protect the future of our children. Let us respond to Mrs. Gordon's call and further unite and act. Dear friends, in the sacred and noble cause of defending peace, we assure you that Chinese women will contribute all their strength. Under the leadership of the WIDF, we will strengthen close cooperation with peace-loving sisters all over the world and strive for lasting world peace and the interests of women and children.

    We will make a thousandfold efforts to build our motherland, because our motherland serves peace; the better it is built, the more guaranteed world peace will be. We will participate more actively in the international women's peace and democratic movement, and under the banner of the WIDF, we will cooperate closely with peace-loving women all over the world and strive for lasting world peace.

    Long live the unity of women all over the world!

    Long live world peace! (Xinhua News Agency, Copenhagen)

    中国妇女为建设祖国保卫和平而斗争
    ——中国出席世界妇女大会代表团副团长章蕴的演说亲爱的姊妹们、朋友们！
    中国代表团以无限兴奋的心情听取了戈登夫人的报告，她告诉了我们国际民主妇女联合会辉煌的成就，她也告诉了我们全世界各国妇女们如何的为了和平、保卫孩子而英勇斗争，同时她还明确地指出了今后全世界妇女为保卫和平、保卫儿童而努力的方向。我们向全世界保卫和平的姊妹们致敬！我们把更多的敬意献给领导世界妇女和平运动的、全世界妇女的光辉旗帜——国际民主妇联。
    我们中国妇女是联合在国际民主妇联旗帜下的世界妇女保卫和平的队伍中一个组成部分，因而我们感到荣幸。这是由于我们曾经长期遭受过侵略战争的灾难——单是日本军国主义侵略中国的战争，就曾经使我们损失了一千万以上的生命。多少白发的母亲失去了儿子，多少年青的妻子失去了丈夫。我们的创痛是诉不尽的。但是，我们中国妇女并没有为悲痛所压倒。为了争取和保卫和平，我们和男子一起，进行了顽强的战斗，终于击败了外国侵略者，取得了民族独立和国内的和平。我们能不热爱并珍贵这用鲜血和生命换来的和平？我们渴望在和平中医治战争创伤；我们渴望在和平中建设我们的国家，使我们的人民全都能享受到美好的生活，使我们的孩子们全都有一个幸福的将来。我国政府和人民正按着上述愿望在前进着。
    战争刚一结束，我全体人民便立即投入了紧张的劳动，来恢复被战争所破坏了的经济。战争的痕迹很快地从我国的城市和乡村中消失了。在短短的三年中，我国工农业生产不仅全部恢复，而且一般都超过了我国历史上最高的水平。过去破破烂烂的工厂和机器修复了，新的工厂出现了，许多从前没有的工业和技术设备，现在有了。在广阔的从封建桎梏下解放了的土地上，各种农作物的产量一年年地增加。一九五二年全国粮食产量已达一亿六千三百七十五万吨，超过了历史上的最高产量。同年全国棉花产量达到一百二十九万吨，将近超过一九四九年产量的两倍，约超过历史上最高年产量百分之五十。
    与此同时，我们还进行了规模巨大的水利工程。淤塞的河流被疏浚了，坚固的防水大堤、水库和水闸修建起来了。在从前年年闹水灾的地区已出现了新的城市和村庄。三年来，我们在水利工程方面所挖的土方数量，比凿苏彝士运河时多二十二倍。
    我国铁路线正在一天天延长，单一九五二年就新建了铁路线四百七十二公里，修复铁路线六百零二公里。
    随着工农业生产和交通运输的恢复与发展，我国国内外贸易也日趋活跃。国家财政收支已经平衡，物价已告稳定，人民的物质和文化生活，有了显著的提高。在这个基础上，我国从今年起，已经开始了第一个五年建设计划。
    三年半来，我国和平建设的成就是巨大的。在这中间，我国妇女的辛勤劳动起了不小的作用。参加工业建设的女工在逐年增加着。她们以极大的热情，参加爱国主义生产竞赛，发挥了高度的创造性和积极性，成为工业建设中一支重要的力量。以女工占全体工人百分之六十的纺织工业来说，一九五二年的棉纱产量超过了历史上最高年产量百分之五十一 点一，棉布超过百分之六十四点八。这个成绩是和纺织业女工的努力分不开的。青年细纱女工郝建秀是我国女工的杰出榜样。由于积极钻研技术，善于集中群众的智慧，她创造了一套科学的细纱工作法。这一新工作法的创造和推广，是我国纺织工业中一个重大的成就。一九五二年，全国出现了二万多名优秀的郝建秀工作者，提高了纺织品的数量和质量，降低了成本，为国家节省了大量的财富。为了响应国家“以重工业为工业建设重点”的号召，不少妇女参加了过去从来没有妇女参加过的生产部门。现在，不论在炼钢炉旁、机械车间、铸造厂、电气室、化验室、船坞内、铁路上，都可以看到妇女在熟练地劳动，为祖国的建设事业服务。她们中间涌现了许多先进工作者。例如鞍山钢铁公司设计处技术员龚昭芝，由于她亲自试验成功，改进了某项管道装置，为国家节约了四十亿人民币的财富。在水利工程中，更有大量的劳动妇女参加；仅参加治淮和荆江分洪工程的女民工，就有三十万人。广大农村妇女的参加农业生产，对全国农业生产的恢复和发展，更起了巨大的作用。
    中国妇女能够发挥这样巨大的作用，是和领导全国妇女运动的中华全国民主妇女联合会积极发动、组织、教育妇女群众所作的努力分不开的。中国人民的胜利使开展妇女运动具备了优越的政治条件。因此，随着解放的到来，规模广阔的深入各阶层妇女的统一的妇女运动，在全国范围内轰轰烈烈地展开了。为时不过三年多，中国各民族、各阶层妇女在中华全国民主妇女联合会领导下，无论在城市和乡村，都团结和组织起来了。中国妇女的组织，和中国工人与青年的组织一样，已经成为巩固人民民主政权、建设祖国、保卫祖国安全与和平的一支强大力量，已经成为妇女自求进步、提高文化、培养工作技能的学校，已经成为保卫妇女权利、为妇女儿童谋福利的旗帜。这是在今年四月召开的中国第二次全国妇女代表大会上总结四年来工作成就时所一致承认的事实。
    在这里我们深深体会到中国妇女运动的迅速开展，和中国的和平建设的迅速开展一样，是和我国的人民民主制度分不开的，和我们国家的坚定的和平政策分不开的。这一点，从我们国家的预算上也可以看出。我国一九五三年国家总预算的百分之五九·二四用于国民经济建设和社会文教建设，而我国的国防费用，虽然在我全国人民努力抗美援朝的条件下，也只占总支出百分之二十二强。这和美国一九五二年到一九五三年会计年度的预算中，支出的直接军事费用占全部支出的百分之七十四，是一个显明的对照。
    我国妇女的和平愿望，不仅表现在积极参加祖国的和平建设上，还明白地表现在我们踊跃参加国际和平运动上。我国妇女热烈响应了国际民主妇联和世界和平理事会的一切号召，并坚决执行它们的一切决议。我国人民在要求缔结五大国和平公约的宣言上签名的有三亿四千万人，其中妇女约占一半。我国妇女以无比的热情欢迎了亚洲妇女代表会议在北京召开，并尽一切努力为亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议服务。我们不断地迎接了各国来我国参观的姊妹们，和派出代表参加国际民主妇联和世界和平理事会所召开的一切会议。一九五一年十一月，我们响应了国际保卫儿童大会筹备委员会的号召，组成了中国人民保卫儿童全国委员会，这个委员会对开展全国儿童保育和教育工作，起了很大的作用。
    我国妇女对英勇斗争的朝鲜姊妹，表示了极大的尊敬和关怀，各阶层的妇女都热心地献出自己的劳动所得和最心爱的东西，来支援朝鲜的妇女和人民。我们收容了在战争中失去父母的二万多名朝鲜孤儿，为他们设立了学校和保育机关，并特别为他们聘了朝鲜的教师。
    为了和平解决朝鲜问题，自一九五一年七月以来，我们就和美国进行了停战谈判。在一年多的谈判期间，我们始终以极大的耐心，提出了种种公平合理的建议，因而使停战协定草案六十三款达成了协议，只有一个战俘问题阻挠着停战的实现。今年三月，朝中方面为了坚持和平解决朝鲜问题的一贯主张和满足世界人民对和平的渴望，又采取了进一步的行动，来解决唯一剩余的战俘问题，以促成朝鲜停战。在金日成元帅、彭德怀将军于今年三月二十八日致函美方克拉克将军表示同意克拉克将军二月二十二日来信中所提在战争期间先行交换病伤战俘的建议之后，中国政府与朝鲜政府先后于三月三十日、三月三十一日发表声明，主张交战双方的谈判代表应即开始关于在战争期间先行交换病伤战俘问题的谈判，并进而谋取整个战俘问题的顺利解决。同时，两国政府共同建议：谈判双方应保证在停战后立即遣返其所收容的坚持遣返的战俘，而将其余的战俘转交中立国，以保证对他们的遣返问题的公正解决。现在在这个共同建议的基础上，朝鲜停战谈判业已恢复。朝中方面在遣返战俘的步骤、时间和方法上作了明显的让步，先后提出了两个公正解决战俘遣返问题的合理方案。美国方面曾经一度提出了一个有损于双方同意的谈判基础的所谓反建议，但是由于世界人民的坚决反对和世界舆论的重大压力，并由于朝中方面坚定的努力，谈判还是得以沿着正常的道路进行。朝鲜停战谈判双方代表团并已于一九五三年六月八日在板门店达成了关于战俘遣返问题的协议，使整个战俘问题得以解决。我们中国妇女认为战俘问题的解决必须促成朝鲜停战的实现，这样，将为朝鲜问题的和平解决开辟道路，从而为远东问题的和平解决准备条件。因此，我们热烈拥护我国政府和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府为了结束朝鲜战争而进行的这种新的努力，认为它完全符合于有子弟在朝鲜作战的双方人民的切身利益，也完全符合于全世界人民的根本利益。它必然受到全世界一切真诚希望和平的人士的欢迎，特别是有自己的孩子和丈夫在朝鲜作战的双方的母亲和妻子们的热烈支持。
    现在是取得朝鲜停战谋求朝鲜和平的重大机会，世界人民有责任督促美国政府以谋求朝鲜和平的诚意不令这个机会白白过去。
    我们同样要求，以协商精神和平解决越南和马来亚的问题，并且无条件地尊重有关各国的独立主权。
    我们中国妇女和全世界爱好和平的妇女，特别是和日本妇女一样，坚决反对复活日本军国主义。我们主张日本与一切有关国家缔结和约，使日本成为和平、民主、自由的国家。我们支持德国人民反对外国军事占领，并认为重新武装西德，将构成对世界和平的严重威胁，德国人民应该有权利与一切有关国家缔结和约，并建立一个统一、和平、民主、自由的德国。
    一切国家人民的民族独立的愿望，必须受到尊重。我们反对一国威胁他国安全的现象，反对一个国家在别国的土地上保有军事基地和驻扎军队。
    我们要求裁减军备，把用于备战的经费，用来增进社会福利和保护母亲和婴儿。
    我们深信，一切不同社会制度的国家，可以和平共处，没有任何国际间的争端不可以用和平协商方法来取得解决。我们主张发展各国间的事务联系，反对一切封锁和禁运政策，尽速恢复并加强各国之间的物资与文化交流，以促进全世界、亚洲经济与文化的繁荣。
    我们中国妇女热烈拥护世界人民和平大会的主张，要求美国、苏联、中国、英国、法国立即开始协商，并缔结五大国和平公约！
    世界人民和平大会国际委员会把要求五大国缔结和平公约的建议递交给五大国政府后，苏联和我国政府已经正式答复，支持这个建议，并随时准备与其他国家的政府合作，来达到维护国际和平与巩固国际安全的崇高目的。我们相信全世界妇女，尤其是美国、英国和法国的妇女，将要负起她们的崇高责任，督促美国、英国和法国政府采取同样的态度。
    亲爱的朋友们，我们妇女们、母亲们，为了保卫和平，保卫我们孩子们的未来，已经做了不少的工作，并且获得了不少的成就。让我们响应戈登夫人的号召，更进一步团结和行动起来。亲爱的朋友们，在保卫和平这一神圣的崇高的事业中，我们向你们保证，中国妇女将贡献出自己一切的力量。我们将在国际民主妇联的领导下，加强与全世界爱好和平的姊妹们亲密合作，为争取和保卫世界持久和平和妇女儿童利益而奋斗。
    我们将千百倍努力建设我们的祖国，因为我们的祖国是为和平服务的；它建设得越好，世界和平就越有保障。我们将更加积极地参加国际妇女和平民主运动，在国际民主妇联的旗帜下，和全世界爱好和平的妇女们亲密合作，为争取和保卫世界持久和平而奋斗。
    全世界妇女团结万岁！
    世界和平万岁！（新华社哥本哈根讯）
