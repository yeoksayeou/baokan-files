State-run Lutai Shuangqiao Wulidian Third Farm
Increases Labor Efficiency in Summer Hoeing and Harvesting

    The Lutai, Shuangqiao, and Wulidian Farms, directly under the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government, are carrying out summer hoeing and harvesting work intensively. In various labor operations, the staff members of each farm are actively trying to improve work efficiency and carefully calculating to save costs, in order to ensure the realization of all production plans.

    The Lutai Farm has planted more than 18,000 mu of rice this year. In the past, weeding was done by hand. According to past experience, more than 70,000 temporary workers would be required this year. In order to reduce costs, the staff and workers of the entire farm created a manual weeding device, which greatly improved work efficiency. In the past, weeding the first time required half a work-day per mu. After using the manual weeding device, each person could weed an average of 2.74 mu per day, more than doubling the work efficiency compared to last year; some people even created a new record of weeding 9.9 mu per day. In this way, only 30,000 temporary workers will be needed this year. The entire farm saved 2,293 work-days more than originally planned during the first weeding. For the first application of top dressing, the original plan was for each person to apply 20 mu per day, but the actual work efficiency was increased to 30 mu, saving a total of 284 work-days.

    The cotton, corn, and other crops of the Wulidian Farm have been thinned in a timely manner, and work efficiency has also been improved compared to the past. For example, the original plan for cotton thinning was two mu per person, but now it has generally increased to 2.5 mu, with the highest reaching 3.3 mu; corn thinning has increased from two mu to 5.2 mu. This has greatly reduced the number of temporary workers used. The advanced Liu Zheng Gang agricultural production team has high morale and is responsible. Before work every day, they hold meetings to discuss work methods, and the team leader checks in a timely manner. The work is done well and quickly every day. So far, the entire team has not used a single temporary worker. On June 13, the entire farm's staff and workers began weeding, ensuring the completion of the first stage of cultivation by June 22.

    The Shuangqiao Farm has completed its cotton, corn, and other thinning work according to plan. The cotton cultivation and weeding work has begun, and the most pressing task of harvesting oats and wheat has arrived. In order to ensure that the green fodder oats can be harvested, dried, and stacked in time, so that it does not mildew in the rainy season, the farm has established a harvesting command and mobilized and organized the strength of the entire farm's staff and workers to invest in this work. Wheat harvesting began on June 18.

    国营芦台双桥五里店三农场
    在夏锄夏收工作中提高了劳动效率
    中央人民政府农业部直属芦台、双桥、五里店农场，正紧张地进行夏锄夏收工作。各场的职工们在各种劳动作业中，都积极想办法提高工作效率，精打细算地节省费用，以保证全部生产计划的实现。
    芦台农场今年共种了一万八千多亩水稻，过去除草是用手拔的。按照往年的经验，今年必须用七万多个临时工。为了降低成本，全场职工创造了人工除草器，大大地提高了工作效率。过去除第一遍草时，每亩须用半个工。使用了人力除草器以后，每天每人平均可以除草二点七四亩，比去年的工作效率提高一倍以上；有人还创造了每日除草九点九亩的新纪录。这样，今年只用三万个临时工就可以了。全场在第一次除草时，就比原计划省工二千二百九十三个。第一次施追肥，原计划每人每日施二十亩，实际工作效率却提高到三十亩，共节省人工二百八十四个。
    五里店农场的棉花、玉米等的定苗工作都已及时进行，工作效率也比过去提高了。例如棉花定苗原计划为每人二亩，现在普通提高到二点五亩，最高的达到三点三亩；玉米定苗由二亩提高到五点二亩。这就大大减少了用临时工的数字。先进的刘振刚农业生产小组，工人工作情绪高，负责任，每天工作前都开会讨论工作方法，组长又及时检查，每天的工作做得又好又快，全组到现在为止没有用一个临时工。六月十三日全场职工开始除草，保证于六月二十二日以前完成第一阶段的中耕。
    双桥农场的棉花、玉米等定苗工作已完成计划。棉花的中耕除草工作已展开，同时最紧张的收割燕麦、小麦的任务已经到来。为保证青饲燕麦能及时收割、晾晒和堆集，不使它在雨季发霉，该场成立了收割指挥部，发动和组织全场职工的力量，投入这一工作。小麦已于六月十八日开始收割。
