    In Dabu Township, Zhongshan County, Guangdong Province, not long after the land reform ended, the foundation of poor and lower-middle peasants was still weak, and farmers did not have a clear understanding of the direction of production. The phenomenon of eating and drinking excessively was widespread. Therefore, after the spring plowing this year, about 10% of the farmers experienced difficulties in their livelihoods. At that time, township cadres lacked sufficient understanding of production for self-salvation and frugal living to overcome the famine, and were paralyzed ideologically, thinking that distributing some fruits of struggle could solve the problem. They did not educate the farmers on production for self-salvation, and the masses generally had the idea of relying on government relief. After the farmers had eaten up the fruits of struggle they had been allocated, they reached out to the farmers' association, asking it to find a solution. Dozens of farmers went to the farmers' association every day to ask for loans or help to sell things to solve the difficulties of lacking food and fertilizer. Some farmers who could not borrow money scolded the township cadres. The township cadres were also very depressed for a time. Later, the township cadres reviewed their past work, criticized the past erroneous idea of relying solely on the distribution of fruits to overcome the famine, and realized that the way to solve the difficulties of the summer famine was mainly to mobilize the masses to carry out production for self-salvation. They divided the work and went deep into the masses, on the one hand, publicizing the policy of production for self-salvation to the masses, and on the other hand, investigating and promoting effective methods of overcoming the famine among the masses.
    After Township Head Lin Dihai went deep into the masses, he found that the mother of poor peasant Liang Fang had run out of food long ago, but had never borrowed money from the farmers' association, and now she still had deposits of more than 100,000 yuan and 19 catties of ramie (worth 50,000 to 60,000 yuan). She overcame the difficulties by cutting pineapple hemp. They also found that some farmers could overcome the famine by weaving bamboo products and digging firewood roots. After learning about these situations, they felt more confident, and on the one hand, held mass meetings to introduce these people's methods of production for self-salvation, and at the same time, took the lead in promoting production for self-salvation among the masses. Township Head Lin Dihai went home and persuaded his mother to go up the mountain to cut pineapple hemp, Farmers' Association Vice Chairman Lin Dangwan led more than 30 households to cut pineapple hemp, Deputy Township Head Huang Wenqiong led more than 30 households to dig firewood roots, and Clerk Huang Tu'an led more than 20 households to weave bamboo products. Under the active leadership and promotion of the cadres, more than 200 households used various methods for production and self-salvation, basically overcoming the difficulties in their lives. The confidence of the disaster victims in overcoming the famine has also been improved, and now no one goes to the farmers' association to ask for loans or sell things anymore.
    However, after production for self-salvation was initially started, many farmers were afraid that the pineapple hemp would be cut off by others and they would have nothing to cut, so they only cared about cutting pineapple hemp and neglected the work of inter-tillage and weeding. For example, the grass in farmer Huang Jianhua's field grew very high, but he did not remove it. The township cadres, on the one hand, launched propaganda, explaining that overcoming the famine was important, but if production was relaxed and the harvest was not good, the food for the next six months would be even more problematic; on the other hand, they helped the masses to carry out family division of labor to ensure that both overcoming the famine and production were not neglected. At the same time, the township cadres themselves took the lead in setting an example. For example, Township Head Lin Dihai himself worked and produced, his mother cut hemp, and his younger brother raised ducks; he actively composted green manure and applied it to the fields, promoting more than a dozen households to accumulate green manure.
    In addition, some farmers still did not pay attention to frugality in production for self-salvation, spending 1,000 yuan for every 1,000 yuan earned, and eating a little better if they earned a little more, without any long-term plans. After the township cadres discovered this situation, they introduced and praised people who could overcome the famine diligently and frugally; at the same time, they appropriately criticized and educated farmers who were not actively engaged in production for self-salvation, reversing the masses' thinking of "living one day at a time."
    In the beginning, the pineapple hemp cut by the masses was mostly purchased by private merchants. Later, when there were more people cutting hemp, the private merchants took the opportunity to lower the price to more than 2,000 yuan, and cheated the masses with Sima scales (old Guangdong scales, larger than the market scales) instead of market scales during the purchase, and spread rumors that the government would not purchase pineapple hemp, which affected the masses' enthusiasm for cutting hemp to overcome the famine. After the township farmers' association discovered this problem, it immediately called the native produce company, and the native produce company decided that the farmers' association would collect it on its behalf (370,000 to 400,000 yuan per picul). The farmers' association immediately explained this to the masses and exposed the tricks of the private merchants to suppress prices and deceive the masses, dispelling the masses' concerns. The masses' enthusiasm for cutting pineapple hemp was even higher. Now the farmers' association can collect more than 300 catties of pineapple hemp every day. On May 20 alone, the income from hemp cutting in the whole township was 1.6 million yuan. Lin Kangmao, who used to take the lead in borrowing money from the farmers' association, now advises people: "To overcome the famine, we must rely on our own production and self-salvation, and not rely on the government!"

    中山县大布乡干部领导群众生产渡荒
    克服了大部群众单纯依靠政府救济的思想
    广东省中山县大布乡土地改革结束不久，贫雇农底子还薄，农民对生产方向还没有明确的认识，大吃大喝的现象普遍存在。因此，在今年春耕后，约有百分之十的农民生活发生困难。当时，乡干部对生产自救、节约渡荒认识不足，思想上很麻痹，以为分些斗争果实便可以解决问题，没有对农民进行生产自救教育，群众普遍有依赖政府救济的思想。农民把分得的斗争果实吃光了，又伸手向农会要，叫农会想办法。每天都有几十个农民到农会要求贷款，或要求帮助卖东西解决缺乏口粮和肥料的困难。有些农民借不到钱，就大骂乡干部。乡干部一时也很苦闷。后来，乡干部检查了过去的工作，批判了过去单纯靠分果实渡荒的错误想法，认识到解决夏荒困难的办法，主要是发动群众进行生产自救。他们就分工分片深入到群众中去，一面向群众宣传生产自救政策，一面调查和推广群众中行之有效的渡荒办法。
    乡长林帝海深入群众以后，发现贫农梁芳的母亲早就没有口粮了，但到现在从未向农会借过钱，并且现在还存款十多万元和十九斤麻（值五、六万元），她是用割菠萝麻的办法克服困难的。另外还发现有的农民靠织竹器、掘柴头也可以渡荒。他们了解到这些情况后，心中有了底，就一面召开群众大会介绍这些人生产自救的办法，同时自己带头推动群众生产自救。乡长林帝海回家说服了母亲上山割菠萝麻，农会副主席林当万带动了三十多户去割菠萝麻，副乡长黄文琼带动了三十多户去掘柴头，文书黄土安带动了二十几家织竹器。在干部这样积极带头推动下，前后共有二百多户人用各种办法进行生产自救，基本上克服了生活困难。灾民的渡荒信心也提高了，现在再没有人去农会要求贷款或卖东西了。
    但生产自救初步搞起来后，许多农民怕菠萝麻被人割完了自己没得割，因此只顾割菠萝麻，忽视了中耕除草工作，如农民黄健华田里的草长得很高也不去除。乡干部就一面展开宣传，说明渡荒固然重要，但如果生产放松了，收成不好，今后半年粮更成问题；一面帮助群众进行家庭分工，做到渡荒生产两不误。同时，乡干部自己也带头做出榜样。如乡长林帝海自己工作和生产，母亲割麻，弟弟养鸭；他积极沤绿肥下田，推动了十几户积绿肥。
    另外有些农民在生产自救中仍不注意节约，赚一千元就用掉一千，赚多一点就吃好一点，没有长期打算。乡干部发现此情况后，又向群众介绍和表扬了能勤俭渡荒的人；同时适当地批评教育了还不积极生产自救的农民，扭转了群众“吃一天算一天”的思想。
    开始群众割菠萝麻多由私商收购，后来割麻的人多了，私商就乘机把价格压低到二千多元，在收购时又用司马秤（广东老秤，较市秤大）代市秤欺骗群众，并造谣说政府不收购菠萝麻，影响了群众割麻渡荒的情绪。乡农会发现这个问题后，马上打电话问土产公司，土产公司就决定由农会代收（每市担三十七万至四十万元）。农会随即向群众讲明白，并揭发了私商压价欺骗群众的伎俩，解除了群众的顾虑。群众割菠萝麻情绪更高了。现在农会每天可代收菠萝麻三百多斤，单是五月二十日一天，全乡割麻就收入了一百六十万元。过去带头向农会借钱的林康茂现在劝人说：“渡荒要靠自己生产自救，不要依赖政府！”（中共中山县第二区区委）
