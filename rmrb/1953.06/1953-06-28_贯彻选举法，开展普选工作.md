Implement the Election Law and Carry Out Universal Suffrage Work

Shanghai's Pilot Basic-Level Election Areas Complete Population Survey and Voter Registration

According to Shanghai Jiefang Daily news: The population survey and voter registration work in Shanghai's pilot basic-level election areas has been initially completed. Among them, five pilot areas are beginning to review voter qualifications and will soon announce voter lists and issue voter certificates. Citizens aged 18 and above in Gaonan Township, a pilot suburban township, have already received their voter certificates. In recent days, the broad masses of people have been highly enthusiastic and are taking practical actions to welcome the arrival of universal suffrage.

What has most satisfied the masses in this pilot work is that the universal suffrage work is closely integrated with production, and all universal suffrage work has adopted simple and easy-to-implement methods. When the work team arrived in Gaonan Township, it was during a prolonged drought, and the farmers in the township were extremely anxious. After understanding this situation, the work team first organized the masses to fight the drought, mobilizing and organizing tools such as bullock-drawn waterwheels, hand-cranked waterwheels, foot-operated waterwheels, and motorized waterwheels to pump water to irrigate the fields, preserving the cotton seedlings on more than 500 mu of cotton fields in the township. Because they solved the urgent problems that the farmers demanded to be solved and won the victory in the fight against the drought, the morale of the masses was high. On this basis, the work team immediately grasped the work of propaganda and mobilization for universal suffrage. The work team's slogan was: "Use our hands to help farmers produce, and use our mouths to publicize the principles of universal suffrage." The team members widely carried out activities in the fields and were welcomed by the farmers everywhere. The farmers said, "We must listen to the government, do a good job in production to welcome universal suffrage." In order to utilize the spare time from production to publicize the great significance of universal suffrage, the time for mass meetings in each pilot area was generally streamlined to within one and a half hours. The Yimin Dyeing and Weaving Factory in Putuo District held a report meeting on a day off, and the vast majority of workers who were off work automatically attended. In order to facilitate residents with heavy housework to hear the report on universal suffrage, Huangpu District specially issued each household several kinds of admission tickets for listening to the report at different times. Each pilot area clearly explained to the masses in advance the significance, registration time, location, and content of the population survey and voter registration. The registration method was also very simple, and the masses were quite satisfied. Most of them brought "drafts" with their names, gender, age, ethnicity, etc. to register. Therefore, the registration work was done quickly, well, and accurately. More than a dozen factories in Putuo District used the lunch break or evening time to conduct group registration, and several of the larger factories completed the factory's population registration within an average of 20 minutes. The six registration stations in Yuqing Lane in Putuo District registered the population of 148 households in two hours.

The broad masses of people in various pilot areas have taken practical actions to welcome the arrival of universal suffrage. The farmers in Gaonan Township generally have high production enthusiasm, and they completed the wheat harvesting work for the entire township five days ahead of schedule. This has never happened in the history of the township. Workers at the Yimin Dyeing and Weaving Factory in Putuo District have expressed their determination to welcome universal suffrage with practical actions to ensure that they reduce short codes by operating carefully.

The Universal Suffrage Work Team in Shuangfengsi District, Chengde County, Rehe Province, etc., Helps the Masses Solve Production Difficulties

The basic-level universal suffrage pilot work teams in Shuangfengsi and Ye Baishou districts in Chengde County, Rehe Province, started with production, helped the masses solve difficulties in production, and laid a good foundation for carrying out universal suffrage work. The pilot villages in Shuangfengsi District are Shuangfengsi, Lao Xiyingzi, Sandaohezi, Damiao, and Xiaodonggou; the pilot villages in Ye Baishou District are Wanshou, Meng Xiyingzi, and Laonitangzi. After the universal suffrage pilot work team arrived in each village on June 3, it studied the problems existing in production in each village, assisted village cadres in distributing food loans, urged the district cooperative to lend fertilizer, and promoted typical experiences such as seedling transplantation, thinning, and replanting, focusing on mutual aid teams. The Zhang Xilin mutual aid team in Laonitangzi Village was not democratic enough, and the pricing of animal power was unreasonable. The work team helped them hold a production meeting, fully promoted democracy, and formulated reasonable animal power prices, which improved the production enthusiasm of the team members. In addition to helping the Du Chang Agricultural Production Cooperative expand the organization of female labor and implement reasonable close planting of crops, the cadres of the work team in Wanshou Village also guided the reasonable close planting of typical mutual aid teams, which led the mutual aid teams in the entire village. Each village work team also had a dedicated person in charge of production issues.

Because the work team cadres assisted the village cadres in solving many problems in production, they were welcomed by the village cadres and the masses, and the relationship between cadres and the masses was closer.

After various production problems were basically resolved, the work team used various occasions to publicize the significance of universal suffrage and mobilize village cadres to actively participate in universal suffrage work. The publicity about universal suffrage was also carried out while taking care of the masses' production. Generally, it was held in the evening, and the meetings were short and concise. Now the village election committees have been established in these two districts, the electoral districts have been divided, and they are preparing to carry out population surveys and voter registration work.

Sichuan Daily Criticizes Jinquan Township in Pixian County for Holding Meetings Every Day, Hindering Production

In the pilot work of basic-level elections in Jinquan Township, Pixian County, Sichuan Province, too many meetings were held, which were not combined with production, affecting agricultural production, and the universal suffrage work was not done well. After the universal suffrage work team arrived in Jinquan Township on May 9, it did not pay attention to combining with production, and each village had to hold meetings almost every night to carry out election work. Because there was no preparation before the meeting, the meeting time was very long, often lasting until late at night. The township also inappropriately convened many large-scale meetings. In Wu Village, a mass meeting was held to publicize universal suffrage, and the cadres reported for more than two hours. None of the meetings were combined with the current production activities. It was precisely in the busy season of production that the activities of the mutual aid teams were stopped. In the half month after the universal suffrage work team went to the countryside, most of the more than 90 mutual aid teams in the township had no time to hold mutual aid team meetings or evaluate work and record points. As a result of conducting universal suffrage work in such isolation, production was seriously affected, and the universal suffrage work was not done well. Some farmers said, "Too many meetings are tiring, and if you talk too much, you can't listen." The farmers still have a very poor understanding of the significance of universal suffrage. At the end of May, when the universal suffrage work team in Jinquan Township summarized the work in the first stage, most of the cadres realized that they must change this situation. For this reason, Sichuan Daily specially used Jinquan Township as a typical example of the failure to combine universal suffrage with production to educate the cadres who are about to lead universal suffrage work in various places.

The Practices of Yongfu and Other Villages in Yushu County, Jilin Province, in Conducting Population Surveys and Voter Registration

From May 18 to 27, the work team of the Jilin Provincial Election Committee completed the population survey and voter registration work in Yongfu, Shuanghe, and Xinyi, three pilot villages for universal suffrage in the third district of Yushu County. Before the population survey and voter registration, the work team conducted publicity on universal suffrage to the masses and cadres, clarifying the confusing ideas and misconceptions of some people, so that the broad masses understood the significance of universal suffrage, the difference between the People's Congress and the People's Representatives Conference, who has the right to vote, who does not have the right to vote, and the purpose of the population survey. The following preparations were also made before the population survey: (1) Publicize the standard time, the resident population, and the method of calculating age (tell the masses not to deduct their age themselves). (2) Mobilize people who are familiar with the family situation to register. Generally speaking, old men or old ladies are suitable. First, they are more familiar with the situation of everyone in the family, and at the same time, they do not delay the masses' production. (3) Inquire from the residents' group leader about the number of households in the group to avoid omissions. (4) Select a propagandist (or residents' group leader) to be responsible for explaining the precautions for registration and the general difficult questions raised by the masses.

The registration method is to set up mobile registration stations in electoral districts and conduct roving registration according to residential groups. For those with many people or with special circumstances (illness, etc.), they are visited at home. When registering, first ask about the population outside the village and newborn children (these people are easily overlooked), then ask the head of household, and then register in accordance with the habits of the masses. After registration is completed, a review is carried out. Three methods were used for the review: (1) Compare with the original household registration book. It was found that the newly registered information was very different from the original household registration. For example, in Yongfu Village, the age of more than 180 people had changed, most of which were falsely reported in the past and now reported truthfully.
 (2) Find the residents' group leader and some of the masses to understand and verify. (3) For those who falsely reported their age, adopt the method of individual visits, guidance, and education to make them correct it automatically. During the population survey and registration, the following types of people are easily overlooked: (1) Newborn babies. Mostly, adults are unwilling to register, saying "I don't know if they will live." (2) Elderly people with illnesses. Some people think that "it is useless to register people who are about to die." (3) Mentally ill patients. (4) Students studying at relatives' homes.

Judging from this population survey, the changes in population and number of households are not small. Before the population survey, there were 1,121 households and 5,044 people in Yongfu, Shuanghe, and Xinyi villages, and after the survey, it increased to 1,238 households and 6,977 people (including 3,416 voters). The reason for the increase in the number of households and population is that newborn babies, immigrants, newly returned demobilized soldiers, foreign teachers, etc., were omitted in the past, and some were not registered in the past.

Voter registration is an extremely serious task. The biggest problem is the determination of voter qualifications. In order to ensure that no reactionary elements or landlords who have not changed their class status illegally steal the solemn right to vote, and that no citizen is wrongly deprived of the solemn right to vote, the selection of personnel for the voter qualification review group and their work must be very cautious. The review group is established after the establishment of the basic-level election committee and is composed of people who have a clear history, are fair, have prestige among the masses, and are familiar with the situation in the village. The party branch committee members, public security committee members, and election work group members lead the work of the review group. Before the work started, the members of the review group studied the relevant documents such as the "Answers to Several Questions on Voter Qualifications" issued by the Central Election Committee, and studied the policies in light of the specific circumstances, clarifying the policy boundaries. Then it entered the review phase.

The focus of the review is: (1) Landlords who have not changed their class status in accordance with the law; (2) Counter-revolutionary elements who have been deprived of political rights in accordance with the law; (3) Other people who have been deprived of political rights in accordance with the law; (4) Mental patients. General laborers are not reviewed one by one. When reviewing, the above four types of people are listed into a list, and each person is studied to find out the reasons for restoring or depriving them of their civil rights; those with doubts are repeatedly studied. Finally, it is submitted to the mass meeting for discussion and approval, and reported to the county for approval. According to our experience in the review: 1. It is necessary to grasp the comprehensive materials of the people who have been restored and deprived of the right to vote. 2. These situations must be submitted to the masses for discussion, which not only fully promotes democracy, but also conducts an education for the masses, and can reduce deviations.

While issuing the voter certificate, the propagandist publicized the glory of the right to vote and the use of the voter certificate to the masses. Those who were deprived of the right to vote were also educated to abide by government decrees, work hard, and step up their transformation. (Office of the Jilin Provincial Election Committee)

    贯彻选举法，开展普选工作
    上海市基层选举典型试办地区人口调查和选民登记工作完成
    据上海解放日报消息：上海市基层选举典型试办地区的人口调查和选民登记工作已初步告一段落，其中有五个典型试办地区正开始审查选民资格，不久将陆续公布选民名单，核发选民证。市郊典型试办乡——高南乡的年满十八周岁的公民已经领到了选民证。日来广大人民群众情绪高涨，他们纷纷以实际行动迎接普选的到来。
    这次典型试办工作最使群众满意的是：普选工作与生产紧密结合，各项普选工作都采取了简便易行的方法。在工作队到达高南乡时，正当久旱未雨，该乡农民异常着急。工作队了解了这一情况后，就首先组织群众进行抗旱，动员和组织了牛拉水车、手摇水车、脚踏水车、马达水车等工具抽水灌溉田地，保全了该乡五百多亩棉田的棉苗。因为解决了农民迫切要求解决的问题，获得了抗旱斗争的胜利，群众情绪高涨。在这个基础上，工作队即抓紧做好普选的宣传动员工作。工作队的口号是：“用手帮助农民生产，用嘴宣传普选道理。”队员们广泛在田间展开活动，到处受到农民的欢迎。农民说：“要听政府的话，搞好生产来迎接普选。”为了利用生产的空隙时间宣传普选的伟大意义，各典型试办地区开群众会议的时间一般均精简到一小时半以内。普陀区益民染织厂在休息日开报告会，绝大部分休息的工人都自动到会。黄浦区为便利那些家务繁重的居民们都能听到普选的报告，特地发给每户数种不同时间听报告的入场券。各个试办地区对于人口调查和选民登记的意义、登记时间、地点和内容都事先向群众交代得清清楚楚。登记方法也很简单，群众相当满意。他们大都带了写有姓名、性别、年龄、民族等的“草稿”前往登记。因此，登记工作做得又快、又好、又准确。普陀区的十多个工厂则利用中午休息时间或晚间进行小组分组登记，其中好几个比较大的工厂平均在二十分钟内就做好了厂内人口登记工作。普陀区余庆里中的六个登记站，在两小时内就登记了一百四十八户人口。
    各个典型试办区的广大群众纷纷以实际行动迎接普选的到来。高南乡农民生产热情普遍高涨，他们以五天的时间提前完成了全乡的割麦工作。这在该乡的历史上是从来没有过的。普陀区益民染织厂的工人纷纷表示以认真操作，保证减少短码的实际行动来迎接普选。
    热河省承德县双峰寺区等地普选工作队帮助群众解决生产困难
    热河省承德县双峰寺、建平县叶柏寿两区的基层普选试点工作队从生产入手，帮助群众解决生产中的困难，为开展普选工作打下良好基础。双峰寺区的试点村是双峰寺、老西营子、三道河子、大庙、小东沟等；叶柏寿区的试点村是万寿、蒙西营子、涝泥塘子等。普选试点工作队于六月三日到达各村后，即研究了各村生产中存在的问题，协助村干部发放了贷粮，催促区合作社贷出肥田粉，以互助组为重点推广了移苗、间苗、补苗等典型经验。涝泥塘子村张喜林互助组不够民主，畜力工价不合理，工作组帮助他们召开了生产会议，充分发扬民主，订出了合理的畜力工价，提高了组员的生产积极性。万寿村工作组干部除帮助杜昌农业生产合作社扩大组织妇女劳动力，实行农作物合理密植外，并指导典型互助组的合理密植，带动了全村互助组。各村工作组也都有专人掌握生产问题。
    由于工作组干部协助村干部解决了生产中的许多问题，受到了村干部和群众的欢迎，密切了干部和群众的关系。
    在各种生产问题基本获得解决后，工作组就利用各种场合宣传普选意义，动员村干部积极参加普选工作。有关普选的宣传，也是在照顾群众生产的情况下进行的。一般都是在晚间举行，会议开得短小精悍。现在这两个区已成立了村选举委员会，划分了选区，正准备开展人口调查和选民登记工作。     （热河省选举委员会）
    四川日报批评郫县金泉乡天天开会妨害生产
    四川省郫县金泉乡在基层选举典型试办工作中，开会太多，不和生产结合，影响了农业生产，普选工作也没有做好。五月九日，普选工作队到达金泉乡后，没有注意结合生产，各村几乎每天晚上都要开会进行选举工作。由于会前没有准备，开会时间很长，常常开到深夜。该乡还不适当地召开了许多大会。伍村开群众大会宣传普选，干部报告了两个多钟头。所有的会没有一次是结合当前的生产活动进行的。正是在生产紧张的季节，互助组的活动反而停顿了。从普选工作队下乡后的半月中，全乡九十多个互助组，绝大多数都没有时间开互助组会，没有评工记分。这样孤立搞普选工作的结果，使生产受到严重影响，普选工作也没有搞好。有的农民说：“会开多了疲倦，讲得多了反而听不进去。”农民对于普选的意义认识还很差。五月底，金泉乡普选工作队在总结第一阶段工作时，多数干部已认识到必须改变这种情况。为此，四川日报特地把金泉乡作为普选和生产不结合的典型，进行批评，以此来教育即将到各地领导普选工作的干部。（李治安）
    吉林省榆树县永富等村进行人口调查和选民登记的作法
    五月十八日至二十七日，吉林省选举委员会工作组在榆树县第三区永富、双合、新义三个普选试点村完成了人口调查和选民登记工作。在人口调查和选民登记之前，工作组曾向群众和干部进行了关于普选的宣传，澄清了一部分人的混乱思想和错误看法，使广大群众懂得了普选的意义，人民代表大会和人民代表会议的区别，那些人有选举权、那些人没有选举权，以及人口调查的目的。人口调查前还做了以下的准备工作：（1）宣传一次标准时间、常住人口、计算年龄的方法（告诉群众不要自己扣除年龄）。（2）动员熟悉全家情况的人去登记。一般说老头或老太太为合适。一来他们对全家每个人的情况比较熟悉，同时也不耽误群众生产。（3）事先向居民组长了解本组户数，以免遗漏。（4）选择一名宣传员（或居民组长）负责解释登记中的注意事项和群众提出的一般疑难问题。
    登记方法是以选区设立流动登记站，按居民小组进行巡回登记。对人多的或有特殊情形的（有病等）则登门访问。登记时先问在外人口、新生小孩（这些人易于遗漏），然后问户主，再按群众习惯依次登记。登记完了进行复查。复查采取了三种方法：（1）按原户口册对照。发现新登记的和原户口的情况相差很大，如永富村就有一百八十余人年龄有变动，其中多数是过去假报的，现在实报了。
    （2）找居民组长和部分群众了解对证。（3）对假报年龄的人，采取个别访问诱导教育的方法，使他自动改正。在人口调查登记时，下列几种人容易被遗漏：（1）新生的小孩。多是大人不愿登记，说“还不知能不能活”。（2）有病的老年人。有人认为“快死的人登记不登记没用”。（3）精神病患者。（4）住亲戚家念书的学生。
    从这次人口调查来看，人口和户数变动是不小的。永富、双合、新义三个村在人口调查前为一千一百二十一户，五千零四十四人，调查后上升为一千二百三十八户，六千九百七十七人（其中选民三千四百一十六人）。户数、人口上升的原因，是过去把新生小孩、迁入人口、新回来的转业军人、外来的教员等遗漏未报，有的是过去没有报户籍。
    选民登记是一件极其严肃的工作。其中最大的问题是选民资格的确定。为作到不让一个反动分子或未经改变成份的地主阶级分子非法窃取了庄严的选举权利，也不让一个公民被错误地剥夺了庄严的选举权利，选民资格审查小组的人选和工作就必须十分慎重。审查小组在基层选举委员会成立后即建立，由历史清楚、为人公正、在群众中有威信、熟悉本村情况的人组成。党的支部委员、公安委员、选举工作组人员领导审查小组的工作。工作开始前，审查小组成员学习了中央选举委员会关于“选民资格若干问题的解答”等有关文件，并结合具体情况研究了政策，明确了政策界限。随后即进入审查阶段。
    审查的重点是：（一）依法尚未改变成份的地主阶级分子；（二）依法被剥夺政治权利的反革命分子；（三）其他依法被剥夺政治权利者；（四）精神病患者。对一般劳动人民则不一一审查。审查时将上述四种人列成名单，逐人研究，查明恢复或剥夺公民权的理由；对有疑问的人更进行了反复的研究。最后交群众大会讨论通过，报县批准。根据我们在审查当中的体会：1、必须掌握被恢复与被剥夺选举权利的人的全面材料。2、要把这些情况交给群众讨论，这样既充分发扬民主，又对群众进行了一次教育，且能少出偏差。
    在发选民证同时，宣传员向群众宣传了选举权利的光荣和选民证的用途。对被剥夺选举权利的人也进行了教育，要他们遵守政府法令，好好劳动，加紧改造。（吉林省选举委员会办公室）
