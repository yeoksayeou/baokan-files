Response to Readers' Criticisms and Suggestions in the People's Daily

    China National Department Store's Letter: Here is our self-criticism report regarding the burning of a shipment of Soviet printed cloth imported by the Tianjin Municipal Company in 1951 (the original letter of criticism was published in the March 29th edition of this newspaper):

    In the first quarter of 1951, our company entrusted the China National Import Corporation to order a batch of Soviet printed cloth, which was transported to Tianjin by rail. The Tianjin Municipal Department Store then received it at the local station. Due to incomplete and untimely original documents, coupled with shortcomings in our work, the receiving work was chaotic, and we failed to detect the burning of the cloth en route. The main responsibilities of our company for this error are: 1. Insufficient prior communication with the railway regarding the incomplete and untimely transmission of shipping documents; we did not insist that documents and goods travel together to promptly improve shipping procedures. At the same time, we also lacked subjective improvements to the receiving and checking methods, failing to effectively prevent confusion in receiving and dispatching goods. In addition, the railway authorities never notified us of the burning incident, nor did they hand over the shipping documents, and the consignor did not send any other shipping notices, so we could not promptly detect the shortage of goods. 2. When receiving goods without original documents, we emphasized objective difficulties such as warehouse space, time constraints, and personnel shortages, and adopted a calculation method of classifying goods by item number and weighing them, then converting the weight into length (i.e., converting each kilogram into a certain number of feet), resulting in inaccuracies in the received quantities. 3. When settling accounts for the Soviet printed cloth with the Import Corporation, because all accounts had not been completely settled, and the portion that was settled was based solely on the total quantity on the Import Corporation's invoices compared with our total received quantity, we did not require the Import Corporation to reconcile based on the original shipping documents and the Tianjin Municipal Department Store's received goods documents, so the shortage of one wagonload of Soviet printed cloth was not discovered for a long time; and before the burning incident was revealed, we never investigated with the railway authorities.

    This work error demonstrates the seriousness of our bureaucratic work style and exposes the chaos in our work methods and the lack of strict systems. We were not conscientious and responsible enough when settling accounts with the Import Corporation. This shows that we lack a serious and responsible attitude towards the people's cause, which is an intolerable shortcoming for state-owned commercial enterprises in the struggle against bureaucracy and the supply system mentality. We should learn from this lesson and strengthen our sense of responsibility in our work, improve our work style and work systems through this incident.

### 中国百货公司对一车花布被焚事件的检讨

    中国百货公司对一车花布被焚事件的检讨
    中国百货公司来信：现将我们对于一九五一年天津市公司进口苏联花布被焚事件（原批评信刊三月二十九日本报）的检查报告如下：
    一九五一年第一季度我公司委托中国进口公司代订苏联花布一批，由铁道联运到天津，再由天津市百货公司在当地车站接收。由于原始单据到的不齐全和不及时，加以我们工作中有缺点，造成接收工作混乱，不能发觉花布中途被焚的事件。这个错误的产生，我公司主要责任是：一、对铁路方面传递运货单据不齐全和不及时问题事先联系不够，没有坚持必须单货同行，及时改善运送手续；同时我们也缺乏从主观上改进接收点验的办法，没有有效地防止收发货中的混乱现象。此外，铁路方面对这项花布被焚事件一直未通知我方，货物运单也未交给我们，而发货方面又无其他的发货通知寄来，因而不能及时发觉货品短欠。二、在我们接收有些无原始单据的来货时，强调仓库、时间和干部等客观困难，采用按货号分类过磅，以重量折算长度（即以每公斤折合若干尺）的计算方法，以致收货数量缺乏正确性。三、在我们与进口公司结算苏联花布账目时，由于全部账目尚未完全结清，而结算了的一部分又是单凭进口公司的发票总数量与我们接收的总数量来核对，没有要求进口公司根据原始发货单据和天津市百货公司接收的到货单据进行核对，以致少收苏联花布一车的事件长期没有发现；而在被焚事件未被揭露以前，也始终未向铁路方面清查。
    这一工作错误说明了我们的官僚主义作风是严重的，也暴露了我们的工作方法混乱，制度不够严格，在与进口公司结算账目时不够认真负责。这说明我们对人民事业缺乏严肃负责的态度，这是国营商业在反官僚主义、反供给制思想斗争中不能容忍的缺点。我们应引为教训，并通过这一事件来加强工作的责任心，改进我们的工作作风和工作制度。
