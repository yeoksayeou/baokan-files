Xinhua News Agency, June 19th. Washington dispatch: The U.S. Supreme Court convened a special session on the 18th to review Supreme Court Justice Douglas's ruling to stay the execution of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg.

    During the special session, the Rosenbergs' defense lawyers reiterated that the Rosenbergs were completely innocent. Justice Douglas also cited reasons to prove that sentencing the Rosenbergs to death, even according to the judicial authorities' claims, was not in accordance with the law. However, U.S. Deputy Attorney General Stern, representing the Justice Department, insisted on rejecting Justice Douglas's ruling.

    In defending the Justice Department's stubborn demands, Stern placed the judicial authorities in an untenable contradiction. Initially, to justify the baseless death sentence, the judicial authorities insisted that the Rosenbergs had committed the "crime" of selling atomic bomb secrets and repeatedly emphasized that this "crime" continued until their arrest in 1950. According to the Atomic Energy Act promulgated in 1946, such a death sentence required a recommendation from a jury. When it was pointed out in court that the death sentence for the Rosenbergs had not been recommended by a jury, and therefore could not be established under the Atomic Energy Act, Stern argued that the Rosenbergs' so-called "atomic espionage" occurred before 1946 and that there were no atomic energy-related crimes after 1946, so the above-mentioned provisions of the Atomic Energy Act did not apply. However, under a series of questioning, Stern admitted that he did "not have a complete grasp of all the facts of the case." He also admitted that if the Atomic Energy Act were applied, then the case would not stand at all, and the Justice Department would become a "laughingstock."

    The Supreme Court's special session on the 18th, after hearing opinions, adjourned and announced that it would make a decision at noon on the 19th. Before the Supreme Court makes a decision to overturn Justice Douglas's ruling, the stay of execution will remain in effect.

    美国司法部当局力图杀害罗森堡夫妇
    美最高法院特别庭仍在审查道格拉斯的裁决
    【新华社十九日讯】华盛顿消息：美国最高法院十八日召开特别庭，审查最高法院法官道格拉斯关于缓期执行罗森堡夫妇死刑的裁决。
    在特别庭上，罗森堡夫妇的辩护律师再次力陈罗森堡夫妇完全是清白无罪的。法官道格拉斯也举出理由，证明判罗森堡夫妇死刑，即使按司法当局所说情况，也是不合乎法律的。但是，代表司法部出庭的美国副检察长斯特恩仍坚持要求否决道格拉斯法官的裁决。
    斯特恩在为司法部的固执的要求辩护时，使司法当局陷入了不能自圆其说的矛盾中。司法当局当初为了替没有根据的死刑判决辩解时，硬说罗森堡夫妇犯的是盗卖原子弹秘密的“罪”，而且曾一再强调这种“罪”行一直继续到一九五○年被捕之时。按照一九四六年颁布的原子能法，这种死刑的判决需经陪审团提议。当法庭上指出，对罗森堡的死刑判决并未经陪审团建议，因而按原子能法不能成立时，斯特恩又辩解说，罗森堡夫妇的所谓“原子弹间谍罪”是在一九四六年前，在一九四六年以后并没有与原子能有关的罪行，因此不适用原子能法中的上述规定。但是在一连串责问之下，斯特恩承认他并“没有掌握案件的全部情节”，他同时又承认如果应用原子能法，那末这一案件就根本不能成立，司法部将成为“笑柄”。
    最高法院十八日特别庭在听取意见后，宣布休庭到十九日中午再作决定。在最高法院作出否决道格拉斯的裁决的决定以前，缓期执行的裁决将保持有效。
