Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 21st. Frontline reporter Shi Feng reports: As the Korean armistice neared realization and fighting on the front lines subsided, the grave incident of the Syngman Rhee gang "releasing" over 25,000 captured Korean People's Army personnel with the connivance of the US, aroused enormous anger among the broad ranks of commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. Upon hearing this news from radios and telephones, almost all of them said: "This is the US aggressors deliberately conniving with the Syngman Rhee gang to sabotage the armistice!"

"They must be made to return all 25,000+ of our personnel who were ‘released’ to the prisoner-of-war camps!"

When the reporter arrived at one company, the soldiers were angrily expressing their opinions. Squad Leader Fu Guoying said: "With the armistice about to be realized, the Syngman Rhee gang dares to commit such a serious incident challenging the peace demands of the people of the world with the connivance of the US military headquarters. This is the best proof that the US is forcibly detaining our captured personnel." Soldier Luo Yongfeng said: "The agreement on the repatriation of prisoners of war, the last obstacle to the armistice, was signed only ten days ago. Before the armistice agreement could even be signed, the Syngman Rhee gang sabotaged it with the connivance of the US. This is a serious provocation by the warmongers against the peace demands of the people of the world! It exposes from head to toe that they are not credible in keeping agreements."

The soldiers fully supported the opinions put forward by Marshal Kim Il-sung and Commander Peng Dehuai in their letter to General Clark, Commander of the United Nations Forces. Soldier Li Fengyou said: "The US side is fully aware that Syngman Rhee wants to make trouble. They can't shirk their responsibility. The US must retrieve all the captured Korean People's Army personnel 'released' and coerced into detention by the Syngman Rhee gang, who are preparing to incorporate them into the South Korean army, and guarantee that no similar incidents will ever occur again."

Many soldiers expressed the same sentiment: Our determination to strive for an armistice and a peaceful resolution to the Korean question is unshakable. We must continue to maintain a high degree of vigilance in the future and work tirelessly for a peaceful resolution to the Korean question.

    愤怒谴责美方纵容李承晚破坏协议
    【新华社朝鲜前线二十一日电】本社前线记者石峰报道：当朝鲜停战接近实现，前线战斗转趋沉寂的时候，美方纵容李承晚匪帮“释放”了二万五千多名朝鲜人民军被俘人员的严重事件引起中国人民志愿军广大指挥员、战斗员的巨大愤怒。他们从收音机和电话里听到这个消息以后几乎都这样说：“这是美国侵略者故意纵容李承晚匪帮破坏停战！”
    “一定要他们把‘释放’的二万五千多个我方被俘人员全部送回俘虏营去！”
    记者到一个连队里去的时候，战士们正在愤愤地发表他们的意见。班长傅国英说：“眼看停战快要实现，李承晚匪帮竟敢在美军总部的纵容下做出这样对全世界人民和平要求的挑战的严重事件，这就是美方强迫扣留我方被俘人员最好的证明。”战士罗永峰说：“关于最后阻碍停战的战俘遣返问题的协议签订了才不过十天，还没有等到停战协定签字，李承晚匪帮就在美方的纵容下破坏了它，这是好战分子对全世界人民和平要求的严重挑衅！从头到脚暴露出他们是不守协议的信用的。”
    战士们完全拥护金日成元帅和彭德怀司令员在给联合国军总司令克拉克的信上所提出的意见。战士李凤有说：“李承晚要捣鬼，美国方面是完全知道的，他们别想推卸责任。美国必须把李承晚匪帮‘释放’和胁迫扣留、并准备编入南朝鲜军队中去的朝鲜人民军被俘人员，全部追回，并保证以后绝对不再发生任何同类事件。”
    许多战士都这样表示：我们争取实现停战与和平解决朝鲜问题的决心是不可动摇的，我们今后要继续保持高度的警惕，为和平解决朝鲜问题而奋斗不懈。
