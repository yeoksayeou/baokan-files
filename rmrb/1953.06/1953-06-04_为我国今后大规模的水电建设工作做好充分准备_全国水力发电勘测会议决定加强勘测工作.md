    To make full preparations for large-scale hydropower construction in our country in the future, the National Hydropower Survey Conference decided to strengthen survey work.
    The General Bureau of Hydropower Construction of the Ministry of Fuel Industry convened the National Hydropower Survey Conference from May 15th to 25th. The conference reviewed and summarized the past survey work, unified the understanding of hydropower survey work, and preliminarily proposed to carry out survey work on several rivers across the country to make full preparations for large-scale hydropower construction in our country in the future.
    Careful survey work on water resources and related geological conditions is key to hydropower construction. In the few years since liberation, our country has carried out hydropower survey work in several regions and achieved some results. Surveys of varying degrees have been conducted in the basins of several rivers in our country, such as the Yellow River, Zi River, Yuan River, Xin'an River, Nen River, and Hun River. Measurement, drilling, and economic surveys have been conducted in important areas, which has provided important data for the construction of hydropower stations in the future. However, because hydropower construction is an extremely complex and new undertaking, and all aspects lack experience, there are still many shortcomings in the past work. The main reasons are the lack of a clear understanding of the characteristics of hydropower construction (complexity and long-term nature), and the failure to understand that full preparation must be made before any hydropower station is started, especially insufficient understanding of the importance of survey work and neglecting the most fundamental geological and hydrological data. The comprehensiveness and complexity of survey work were also not fully understood. The survey of water resources was not carried out by thoroughly and comprehensively understanding the entire river, but by grasping one place at a time and rushing to construction. At the same time, there was a lack of unified regulations for measurement, drilling, geological surveys, and economic surveys in the past. Not enough attention was paid to safe operations, and there were no technical safety regulations, etc. Due to the existence of these shortcomings, the past hydropower construction work suffered considerable losses.
    Our country has a heavy task of hydropower construction this year. The state investment has increased twenty times compared with last year, and it will be greatly increased in the future. This shows the country's attention to hydropower construction. In order to meet this glorious and arduous task, this conference conducted repeated research and discussions on how to carry out survey work systematically, organizationally, persistently, arduously, and meticulously in the future. Liu Lanbo, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Fuel Industry, and Li Rui, Director of the General Bureau of Hydropower Construction, both gave reports. Soviet experts also gave special reports on hydropower survey work. The reports pointed out that survey is the key issue in hydropower construction. If the survey is really done well, the construction is equivalent to half completed. Soviet experts specifically pointed out in their speeches that the Soviet Union generally decides to build a hydropower station only after comparing dozens of comparative plans. Therefore, without a careful survey of water resources and a comparison of a large number of specific plans, hydropower construction cannot be carried out economically and rationally. In the discussion, all the representatives examined the past work of not paying attention to survey work, not considering carefully, being eager for quick success, and engaging in work with subjective imagination, and began to realize that this is a struggle between the bourgeoisie and the working class on the two roads of economic construction and technical thought. The conference also strictly examined and criticized the thinking of technical cadres who did not pay attention to survey work, such as some who mistakenly believed that survey work had no way out and no future; and some who believed that survey work was "running errands" and "serving people," etc. During the discussion, everyone realized that this kind of individualism would be very harmful to the hydropower construction of the motherland. Many representatives expressed their determination in the discussion to do a good job in survey work arduously for a long time and overcome impatience. The conference also exchanged advanced experiences in survey work in Northeast, Central South, Southwest and other places. The conference also discussed draft regulations on measurement, drilling, geological work, and technical safety, etc., based on work requirements and practical experience in various places. Zhang Tie铮, Deputy Director of the Bureau, proposed in the summary of the conference
    Preliminary plans for survey work in 1953 and 1954. The preliminary plan proposes to carry out survey work on the Yellow River and its tributaries, as well as the Han River, Hun River, Yuan River, Xin'an River, Qiantang River, Jialing River, Gan River, and various rivers in northern Yunnan, and prepare technical and economic survey reports. In addition, general resource survey work will be carried out in the Hutuo River in North China, the Wu River and Min River in Southwest China, and other places.

### 为我国今后大规模的水电建设工作做好充分准备  全国水力发电勘测会议决定加强勘测工作

    为我国今后大规模的水电建设工作做好充分准备
    全国水力发电勘测会议决定加强勘测工作
    中央燃料工业部水力发电建设总局于五月十五日到二十五日召开了全国水力发电勘测会议。会议检查和总结了过去的勘测工作，统一了对水电勘测工作的认识，会上并初步提出将在全国若干河流开展勘测工作，为我国将来大规模水电建设作好充分准备工作。
    对水力资源和有关地质情况周密的勘测工作是水力发电建设中的关键。解放几年来，我国曾在若干地区进行了水电勘测工作，并取得了一些成绩。我国若干河流如黄河、资水、沅水、新安江、嫩江、浑河等流域，都进行了程度不同的勘测，对于重要地区并作了测量、钻探和经济调查，这就为今后水电站的建设提供了重要资料。但因水电建设是一项极其复杂的和新的工作，各方面都缺乏经验，因此，在过去的工作中也存在不少缺点，主要是对水力发电建设的特点（复杂性与长期性）缺乏明确的认识，不懂得在任何一个水电站动工以前，必须做好充分的准备工作，特别是对勘测工作的重要性认识不足，忽视最根本的地质与水文资料。对勘测工作的全面性、复杂性也认识不够，对水力资源的勘测，不是先对全河川进行彻底的、全面的了解，而是抓住一处就一处，并急于施工。同时过去测量、钻探、地质调查、经济调查都缺乏统一的规程。对安全作业重视也不够，没有技术保安规程等。由于这些缺点的存在，使得过去的水电建设工作受到了不小的损失。
    我国今年水电建设的任务很重，国家投资比去年增加了二十倍，今后还将大大增加，这说明国家对于水电建设的重视。为了迎接这一光荣而艰巨的任务，这次会议对于今后如何有系统有组织地、长期艰苦地、周密地进行勘测工作，作了反复的研究和讨论，中央燃料工业部刘澜波副部长和水力发电建设总局李锐局长均作了报告，苏联专家对水电勘测工作也作了专题报告。报告中指出了勘测是水电建设中的关键问题，勘测真正做好了，建设就等于完成了一半。苏联专家在发言中特别提出：苏联一般的要从数十个比较方案中才决定建设一个水电站，所以如果没有对水力资源周密的勘测以及大量具体方案的比较，水电建设就不可能经济合理地进行。全体代表在讨论中间检查了过去工作中不重视勘测工作、考虑不周、急于求成和以主观想像从事工作的思想和做法，并开始认识到这是经济建设和技术思想上资产阶级和工人阶级两条道路的斗争。会上还严格检查和批判了技术干部不重视勘测工作的思想，如有的错误地认为勘测工作没有出路，没有前途；有的认为勘测工作是“当差”、“侍候人”等。讨论中大家认识到这种个人主义思想对于祖国水电建设将是十分有害的。不少代表在讨论中表示决心要长期艰苦地作好勘测工作，克服急躁情绪。会上并交流了东北、中南、西南等地勘测工作中的先进经验。会议还根据工作的要求和各地实际经验，讨论了有关测量、钻探、地质工作和技术保安等规程草案。张铁铮副局长在会议总结中，提出了
    一九五三年和一九五四年内勘测工作的初步计划。初步计划中提出将在黄河及其支流，以及汉水、浑江、沅水、新安江、钱塘江、嘉陵江、赣江、滇北各河等河流进行勘测工作，准备编制技术经济调查报告，另外将在华北的滹沱河、西南的乌江、岷江等地作一般性的资源勘测工作。
