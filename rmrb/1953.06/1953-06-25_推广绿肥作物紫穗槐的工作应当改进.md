The work of promoting the planting of the green manure crop Amorpha fruticosa in key areas such as Hebei and Shanxi has fallen into a state of laissez-faire, and urgently needs to be inspected and improved.

Based on the experience of Wang Guilin, a labor model from Tianjin County, Hebei Province, and several farms, the Soil and Water Conservation Bureau of the Central Ministry of Agriculture has been focusing on promoting the green manure crop Amorpha fruticosa in Hebei, Shanxi, Suiyuan, Shandong, Henan, and the suburbs of Beijing since this year. A total of 100,000 jin of seeds were distributed this year. The seeds were distributed to key promotion areas as early as March. However, the spring sowing season for Amorpha fruticosa has now passed, and the seeds in most areas are still piled up in district and village governments, and have not been promoted at all. Jiugong Village in the southern suburbs of Beijing originally received 120 jin of seeds, but returned 80 jin to the district. These seeds returned to the district are piled up in the district government.

In the few areas where this work has been arranged and the seeds have been distributed, the effect is also very small due to the neglect of in-depth publicity and the lack of specific guidance. Some farmers in some areas believe that it doesn't matter whether or not the seeds distributed free of charge are planted. Some farmers in some areas do not understand the planting methods, and although they have planted them, they cannot emerge because the soil is too thick or they have not been soaked.

In the distribution work, there have also been deviations from reality. For example, when some farms in Shanxi Province distributed Amorpha fruticosa seeds on behalf of the government, they adopted the method of distributing them evenly to labor models. According to the North China Spring Farming Production Inspection Team, there is a lot of land in Wuxiang County, Shanxi Province, that can be planted with Amorpha fruticosa, and the masses are willing to plant it, but there is a lack of seeds.

The main reason why this work has fallen into a state of laissez-faire is that the Soil and Water Conservation Bureau of the Central Ministry of Agriculture lacked careful planning before leading this work, and did not actively conduct inspections afterwards. When this work was first arranged, the bureau selected the suburbs of Beijing as a key experiment, intending to gain experience from here and then use this experience to guide other areas. However, the bureau never provided specific guidance for this key experiment. The bureau has also never conducted inspections of the key promotion areas. Although the spring sowing season for Amorpha fruticosa has passed, this plant can still be sown in the summer (sown during the rainy season). Provincial agricultural and forestry departments should seize the opportunity to actively promote the summer sowing of Amorpha fruticosa in key promotion areas. This year is the first year of promoting Amorpha fruticosa, and most farmers are not yet accustomed to and confident in planting this green manure crop. In the promotion, farms should first demonstrate and cultivate seedlings for farmers to plant. Shandong has adopted this method and is very popular with farmers. State-owned farms in various localities should also provide demonstrations and technical guidance to the masses on how to harvest, ferment, and compost.

### 推广绿肥作物紫穗槐的工作应当改进

    推广绿肥作物紫穗槐的工作应当改进
    河北、山西等地重点推广种植绿肥作物紫穗槐的工作陷于自流，亟待检查改进。
    中央农业部水土利用局根据河北省天津县劳动模范王桂林和若干农场的经验，从今年起在河北、山西、绥远、山东、河南及北京市郊等地重点推广绿肥作物紫穗槐。今年推广的种籽共十万斤。种籽早在三月间就发到了各重点推广地区。但是，目前紫穗槐春播期已经过去，多数地区的种籽还积压在区、村政府，根本没有推广下去。北京郊区南苑旧宫村原领种籽一百二十斤，结果退还区里八十斤。这些退回区里的种籽，就积压在区政府里了。
    在少数已经布置这一工作、并将种籽发下去的地区，由于忽视深入宣传和没有进行具体指导，效果也很小。有的地区的农民认为无价配给的种籽，种不种没关系。有的地区的农民因为不了解种植方法，虽然是种下去了，但是覆土过厚或没有经过浸种，不能出苗。
    在分配工作中，也发生了不从实际出发的偏向。如山西省某些农场在代替政府分配紫穗槐种籽时，采用了平均分配给劳动模范的办法。据华北春耕生产检查组反映，山西武乡县可种紫穗槐的土地很多，群众也愿意种，但却缺乏种籽。
    这项工作陷于自流的主要原因，是中央农业部水土利用局在领导这一工作中事前缺乏周密的计划，事后又没有积极进行检查。在开始布置这件工作时，该局曾选择北京市郊区为试验重点，打算从这里取得经验，然后利用这种经验指导各地。但是，该局对这个试验重点从没有进行具体领导。对于各重点推广地区，该局也从没有进行过检查。现在紫穗槐的春播季节虽已过去，但这种植物还可以进行夏播（在雨季播种）。各省农林厅在重点推广地区应抓紧时机积极推动紫穗槐的夏季播种工作。今年是推广紫穗槐的第一年，大部地区农民对于种植这种绿肥作物还没有习惯、没有信心。在推广中，应当先由农场示范，并由农场育出苗来再给农民种植。山东各地采取了这种办法，很受农民欢迎。对于如何收割沤制堆肥，各地方国营农场也应对群众作好示范和技术指导工作。
