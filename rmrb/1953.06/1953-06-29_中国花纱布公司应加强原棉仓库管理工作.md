Reader's Letters Abstract:

    China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Corporation Should Strengthen Raw Cotton Warehouse Management

    Reader Di Shusan writes: In late April, a fire occurred at the Shijiazhuang raw cotton warehouse of the China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Corporation, destroying a stack of raw cotton. In early June, another fire occurred at the Handan raw cotton warehouse of the China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Corporation, destroying raw cotton worth over one hundred billion yuan. These two fires indicate that there are still quite serious shortcomings in the raw cotton warehouse management of the China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Corporation. The China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Corporation should quickly strengthen warehouse management to prevent further losses of raw cotton. I believe:

    1. The China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Corporation should strengthen the political and ideological education of management personnel and enhance their sense of responsibility. The selection of warehouse management personnel should be cautious to prevent the infiltration of saboteurs.

    2. The China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Corporation’s raw cotton storage depots in various locations have large quantities of cotton, but often lack adequate fire-fighting equipment. For example, after the fire in the Handan warehouse, the fire trucks from nearby rushed to put out the fire only to find that there was not enough water; if it were not for the courageous rescue by the workers of the No. 1 State-owned Cotton Mill, tens of millions of catties of cotton would have been burned. Therefore, raw cotton storage depots in various locations should quickly strengthen fire prevention work and replenish fire-fighting equipment. Fire hydrants should be added in places with tap water, and fire-fighting equipment such as water storage pools should be added in places without tap water.

    Zheng Shufeng, Zhao Yue, and others write: The raw cotton warehouse of the Handan Branch of the China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Corporation caught fire in the late night of June 4th and was not extinguished until noon on the 5th. It is estimated that more than ten million catties of cotton were burned.

    The reason for this shocking loss is inseparable from the bureaucratic style and paralyzing complacency of the Handan Branch of the China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Corporation. This warehouse is an open-air yard, covering an area of 150 mu, but it stores more than 20 million catties of cotton. Therefore, the cotton stacks are large, the distance between the stacks is small, and the stacks are covered with mats. Such a large warehouse has very simple fire-fighting equipment, with only three firefighters, a fire truck converted from a jeep, a few fire extinguishers, and several wells and pools with insufficient water sources. After the warehouse caught fire in the late night of June 4th, although local troops, workers, and citizens rushed to rescue it, the fire was difficult to extinguish due to the lack of fire-fighting equipment. It was not until fire trucks were transferred from Shijiazhuang, Anyang, Xingtai, and other places that the fire was extinguished at noon on the 5th.

    In order to clarify the truth, learn lessons, and prevent similar incidents from happening again, in addition to suggesting that relevant parties thoroughly investigate the cause of the fire and give due punishment to those who derelicted their duties, we also suggest that the China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Corporation immediately notify its branches to conduct a comprehensive inspection of the stacking specifications and fire-fighting equipment of various raw cotton warehouses and yards. Any security situations that are not good should be immediately improved with effective measures. In addition, in the future, when storing goods in raw cotton warehouses, we must pay attention to reducing costs and ensuring safety at the same time. The current phenomenon of some warehouses simply pursuing multi-stacking and multi-storage to reduce costs without paying attention to safety should be corrected.

### 中国花纱布公司应加强原棉仓库管理工作

专栏：读者来信摘要

    中国花纱布公司应加强原棉仓库管理工作
    读者邸树三来信：四月下旬花纱布公司石家庄原棉仓库发生火灾，烧毁原棉一垛。六月上旬，花纱布公司邯郸原棉仓库又发生火灾，烧毁原棉价值千亿元以上。这两次火灾，说明花纱布公司原棉仓库管理工作中还存在着相当严重的缺点。花纱布公司应当迅速加强仓库管理工作，以免原棉再受损失。我认为：
    一、花纱布公司应加强对管理人员的政治思想教育，提高管理人员的责任心。对仓库管理人员的选择应该慎重，以免混入破坏分子。
    二、花纱布公司各地原棉堆栈存花量很大，但往往没有妥善的消防设备。如邯郸仓库发生火灾后，附近救火车驰往救火时，才知道没有足够的水源；若不是国棉一厂工人奋勇抢救，数千万斤棉花便会烧光。因此，各地原棉堆栈应当迅速加强消防工作，充实消防设备。有自来水的地方应多加消防拴，没有自来水的地方应增设储水池等灭火设备。
    郑树锋、赵越等来信：中国花纱布公司邯郸分公司原棉仓库于六月四日深夜失火，燃烧到五日中午才扑灭。据估计，被烧毁的棉花在一千万斤以上。
    这一惊人损失之所以发生，是和中国花纱布公司邯郸分公司的官僚主义作风及麻痹大意思想分不开的。这个仓库是一个露天货场，占地一百五十亩，但却存放了二千多万斤棉花。因此，棉花的堆垛大，垛与垛之间的距离小，而垛子又都是用席遮盖的。这样大的仓库，消防设备却十分简陋，只有三个消防员，一辆由吉普车改装的消防车，几个灭火器，几个水源不足的水井和水池。六月四日深夜该仓库起火后，虽经当地驻军、工人和市民赶来抢救，但因消防设备太少，火势很难扑灭，直到从石家庄、安阳、邢台等地调来消防车以后，才在五日中午把火扑灭。
    为了弄清事实真相，吸取教训，防止今后再发生类似事件，我们除了建议有关方面彻查起火原因，给失职人员以应得的处分外，并建议中国花纱布公司立即通知所属各分支公司对各原棉仓库、货场的堆放规格和消防设备进行一次普遍检查，凡保安情况不好的应立即采取有效措施来加以改善。此外，今后各原棉仓库存货时必须同时注意减低成本和保证安全。目前某些仓库单纯追求多堆多放、减低成本，不注意安全的现象应该纠正。
