    The first National Opera Performance and Exhibition Conference has brought about some gratifying new developments in the public opera troupes participating in the conference from East China, and in the opera reform work in various parts of East China.

    Learning from the Excellent National Opera Art Heritage

    The National Opera Festival centrally exhibited a portion of the excellent heritage of national opera over the past several hundred years, greatly broadening the horizons of the cadres and artists involved in opera reform work in East China who participated in the festival. Faced with the ocean of the motherland's artistic heritage, they felt how small what they had done was. For some cadres and artists, learning from the excellent national opera heritage has begun to enter the stage of practice from the past verbal recognition.

    In the past, the work of reviewing and approving old plays in various parts of East China was not done well enough, and therefore it was not possible to change the chaotic phenomenon in performances in various places in a timely manner. The excellent traditional plays performed by various regions during the festival inspired opera workers, especially leading cadres, to pay attention to this work. Leading cadres in opera reform work in Jiangsu Province and Shanghai City have begun to cooperate with artists to review and approve old plays. The Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Culture also recommended the excellent plays from the festival to private troupes. Shandong Province adopted the method of "going to the sea to fish," sending cadres deep into a LÃ¼ opera troupe to systematically conduct some research work. This work is necessary. For example, Jianghuai Opera originally had many good plays, but after arriving in Shanghai, it was influenced by the serial plays of Peking Opera and abandoned those plays. After the Huai Opera artists saw that the Southwest and Central South regions performed many good old plays in Beijing, they realized that they also had many old plays to perform. After they returned and conveyed this to the Huai Opera circles, everyone paid more attention to sorting out old plays. The sorting out of the old plays and folk minor operas of Jianghuai Opera and Huaiyang Opera has been designated by the Creation Office of the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Culture Art Affairs Management Office as one of the key tasks this year.

    After some local opera genres entered the city, their connection with the countryside gradually became alienated or even severed. This also made the improvement of art lack an important foundation. After participating in the festival, the East China Yue Opera Experimental Troupe went to the "hometown of Yue Opera" in Shengxian County, eastern Zhejiang, for more than a month of performance and observation. From observing the performances of rural troupes, they found that the tunes of Yue Opera were much richer than what they are now singing. Moreover, rural troupes mostly perform Yue Opera with both men and women. The Yue Opera Troupe observed the Tiaqiang Opera troupe, puppet shows, and other opera genres in Xinchang, and Wuju Opera and Muju Opera in Jinhua. There are more than 800 tunes in Wuju Opera, and more than 100 are commonly used. These tunes have now been recorded with audio and musical scores, which will undoubtedly add new blood to Yue Opera in musical art. The Yue Opera Troupe also selected ten male actors with better acting skills from rural troupes to prepare for a trial performance of men and women together.

    Love Artistic Labor, Value One's Glorious Mission

    The National Opera Festival made every opera worker feel the importance of their responsibility to the country and the people. When they understand that their artistic labor has a significant impact on the spiritual life of the broad masses of the people, they feel happy, excited and glorious.

    Taking Shanghai Opera as an example, for a long time, Shanghai Opera artists have not fully understood the performance policy of reflecting modern life. Even in the public Shanghai People's Shanghai Opera Troupe, some people once thought: "Why can't we perform ancient costume plays? Can't we perform them well?" "Yue Opera performs ancient costume plays, which are popular and sell well." Last year, they went to Beijing with this thought. The modern plays performed by brother opera genres in other regions gave them great encouragement; their own performance of "Luohan Qian" was praised and won an award, which opened the knot in their minds. It is a glorious task to express the modern people's life, and Shanghai Opera is one of the opera genres suitable for expressing modern life. Recently, the public Shanghai Opera Troupe performed "Luohan Qian" and other new plays in Shanghai, Wuxi and other places, and they were welcomed by workers and farmers. When performing outdoors in the suburbs of Shanghai, farmers from villages and towns more than ten or twenty miles away braved the cold wind to come and stand for several hours. In their own practice, the Shanghai Opera artists realized that the people are very welcome to operas that express new life and new characters, and the masses' love made the artists no longer doubt the path of Shanghai Opera's expression of modern life.

    This sense of glory and responsibility is further strengthened because the Party and the state attach importance to opera and artists. The reporter interviewed the Yue Opera, Shanghai Opera and Huai Opera artists who participated in the festival. From everyone's even brief conversation, they all invariably revealed the emotion of not only joy, but also love for their own artistic labor. The Huai Opera artists told the reporter that Huai Opera was not valued before liberation, and could only be performed in the shantytowns of Shanghai's suburbs. The Huai Opera artists never dreamed that they could go to Beijing, perform for Chairman Mao and the central responsible comrades, and perform for experts in the literary and art circles. The care of the leaders for opera and artists is a more precious encouragement to everyone than anything else. The artists all said: "When we heard that we won the award, we really had an unspeakable feeling, both happy and ashamed!" After returning to Shanghai, they all made requests to the leadership, asking to strengthen their studies, improve the work system, and constantly improve their ideological level and artistic level. They gradually realized that only in this way can they be worthy of the glorious title of people's opera workers.

    Learning from Excellent Performance Techniques

    The East China artists who participated in the festival observed the excellent techniques in artistic creation and were greatly inspired and educated. Those diverse and exquisite performance techniques are the crystallization of the hard work of artists of various opera genres, who have experienced a long history and countless predecessors, in order to truly express life. And these excellent performance techniques are exactly what the artists in East China need.

    Many young actors have always believed that a natural good voice can travel all over the world, and practicing Kung Fu is a novel thing for them. Even their voices, they don't know how to protect, to carry out scientific training, so that they change their voices after being on stage for only a few days. After returning from participating in the festival, many actors in the East China Yue Opera Experimental Troupe understood that it is not enough to rely on a good voice. To improve, to perform better, they must also practice body movements and learn dance. Even singing, it is not enough to just sing according to the old tunes, without understanding musical notation. They have to learn musical notation. Yue Opera will be developed into Jiangnan song and dance opera in the future. How can it be developed without practicing singing, dancing, and performance techniques?

    The Shanghai Opera artists have always believed that "Shanghai Opera is the best at performing modern plays." This complacency was almost swept away after watching the performance of "Little Son-in-Law" in the Northeast region. Why is it that when we perform plays that express the life of modern working people, we portray workers and peasants as petty citizens, while "Little Son-in-Law" is better at expressing the true image of peasants? When the Northeast delegation went to Shanghai to perform, the Shanghai People's Shanghai Opera Troupe invited the actors of "Little Son-in-Law" to hold a discussion. The Northeast artists not only told them about their experience in grasping the character and thoughts and feelings of the characters, but more importantly, narrated their own process of understanding and grasping the thoughts and feelings of the working people, that is, the process of their own ideological transformation. In the past, the Shanghai Opera Troupe actors thought that they could not perform workers well, they did not dare to perform soldiers, and they were always confident in performing peasants. But now, they see that they have not performed peasants well either? If they pick up a hoe and turn the hoe head up, the peasants will say at a glance that this is not a peasant. The artists also more deeply realized that without being in touch with real life, acting skills cannot be improved at all.

    However, the new atmosphere generated under the influence of the National Opera Festival is still in a budding and spontaneous state. In this regard, the leadership of opera reform work in East China and Shanghai has shortcomings. After returning from the festival, only one conference was held to convey the information, and no further organization and leadership of the opera circles (including private troupes) was systematically and separately carried out to study and discuss according to the spirit and requirements of the National Opera Festival. At the same time, because the three public troupes in Shanghai represented the East China region in participating in the festival, and were not selected from various provinces, the good influence of the festival was very limited. This limitation has not been overcome, and therefore this good influence has not spread to various provinces and the entire opera circle, becoming an important force to promote the opera reform work in various places to move forward. And this weakness will also weaken those budding and spontaneous good phenomena mentioned above, which is also worth noting.
