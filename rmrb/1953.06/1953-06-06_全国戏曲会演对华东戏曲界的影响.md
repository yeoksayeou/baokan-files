    The first National Opera Performance and Exhibition Conference has brought about some gratifying new developments in the public opera troupes participating in the conference from East China, and in the opera reform work in various parts of East China.

    Learning from the Excellent National Opera Art Heritage

    The National Opera Festival centrally exhibited a portion of the excellent heritage of national opera over the past several hundred years, greatly broadening the horizons of the cadres and artists involved in opera reform work in East China who participated in the festival. Faced with the ocean of the motherland's artistic heritage, they felt how small what they had done was. For some cadres and artists, learning from the excellent national opera heritage has begun to enter the stage of practice from the past verbal recognition.

    In the past, the work of reviewing and approving old plays in various parts of East China was not done well enough, and therefore it was not possible to change the chaotic phenomenon in performances in various places in a timely manner. The excellent traditional plays performed by various regions during the festival inspired opera workers, especially leading cadres, to pay attention to this work. Leading cadres in opera reform work in Jiangsu Province and Shanghai City have begun to cooperate with artists to review and approve old plays. The Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Culture also recommended the excellent plays from the festival to private troupes. Shandong Province adopted the method of "going to the sea to fish," sending cadres deep into a Lü opera troupe to systematically conduct some research work. This work is necessary. For example, Jianghuai Opera originally had many good plays, but after arriving in Shanghai, it was influenced by the serial plays of Peking Opera and abandoned those plays. After the Huai Opera artists saw that the Southwest and Central South regions performed many good old plays in Beijing, they realized that they also had many old plays to perform. After they returned and conveyed this to the Huai Opera circles, everyone paid more attention to sorting out old plays. The sorting out of the old plays and folk minor operas of Jianghuai Opera and Huaiyang Opera has been designated by the Creation Office of the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Culture Art Affairs Management Office as one of the key tasks this year.

    After some local opera genres entered the city, their connection with the countryside gradually became alienated or even severed. This also made the improvement of art lack an important foundation. After participating in the festival, the East China Yue Opera Experimental Troupe went to the "hometown of Yue Opera" in Shengxian County, eastern Zhejiang, for more than a month of performance and observation. From observing the performances of rural troupes, they found that the tunes of Yue Opera were much richer than what they are now singing. Moreover, rural troupes mostly perform Yue Opera with both men and women. The Yue Opera Troupe observed the Tiaqiang Opera troupe, puppet shows, and other opera genres in Xinchang, and Wuju Opera and Muju Opera in Jinhua. There are more than 800 tunes in Wuju Opera, and more than 100 are commonly used. These tunes have now been recorded with audio and musical scores, which will undoubtedly add new blood to Yue Opera in musical art. The Yue Opera Troupe also selected ten male actors with better acting skills from rural troupes to prepare for a trial performance of men and women together.

    Love Artistic Labor, Value One's Glorious Mission

    The National Opera Festival made every opera worker feel the importance of their responsibility to the country and the people. When they understand that their artistic labor has a significant impact on the spiritual life of the broad masses of the people, they feel happy, excited and glorious.

    Taking Shanghai Opera as an example, for a long time, Shanghai Opera artists have not fully understood the performance policy of reflecting modern life. Even in the public Shanghai People's Shanghai Opera Troupe, some people once thought: "Why can't we perform ancient costume plays? Can't we perform them well?" "Yue Opera performs ancient costume plays, which are popular and sell well." Last year, they went to Beijing with this thought. The modern plays performed by brother opera genres in other regions gave them great encouragement; their own performance of "Luohan Qian" was praised and won an award, which opened the knot in their minds. It is a glorious task to express the modern people's life, and Shanghai Opera is one of the opera genres suitable for expressing modern life. Recently, the public Shanghai Opera Troupe performed "Luohan Qian" and other new plays in Shanghai, Wuxi and other places, and they were welcomed by workers and farmers. When performing outdoors in the suburbs of Shanghai, farmers from villages and towns more than ten or twenty miles away braved the cold wind to come and stand for several hours. In their own practice, the Shanghai Opera artists realized that the people are very welcome to operas that express new life and new characters, and the masses' love made the artists no longer doubt the path of Shanghai Opera's expression of modern life.

    This sense of glory and responsibility is further strengthened because the Party and the state attach importance to opera and artists. The reporter interviewed the Yue Opera, Shanghai Opera and Huai Opera artists who participated in the festival. From everyone's even brief conversation, they all invariably revealed the emotion of not only joy, but also love for their own artistic labor. The Huai Opera artists told the reporter that Huai Opera was not valued before liberation, and could only be performed in the shantytowns of Shanghai's suburbs. The Huai Opera artists never dreamed that they could go to Beijing, perform for Chairman Mao and the central responsible comrades, and perform for experts in the literary and art circles. The care of the leaders for opera and artists is a more precious encouragement to everyone than anything else. The artists all said: "When we heard that we won the award, we really had an unspeakable feeling, both happy and ashamed!" After returning to Shanghai, they all made requests to the leadership, asking to strengthen their studies, improve the work system, and constantly improve their ideological level and artistic level. They gradually realized that only in this way can they be worthy of the glorious title of people's opera workers.

    Learning from Excellent Performance Techniques

    The East China artists who participated in the festival observed the excellent techniques in artistic creation and were greatly inspired and educated. Those diverse and exquisite performance techniques are the crystallization of the hard work of artists of various opera genres, who have experienced a long history and countless predecessors, in order to truly express life. And these excellent performance techniques are exactly what the artists in East China need.

    Many young actors have always believed that a natural good voice can travel all over the world, and practicing Kung Fu is a novel thing for them. Even their voices, they don't know how to protect, to carry out scientific training, so that they change their voices after being on stage for only a few days. After returning from participating in the festival, many actors in the East China Yue Opera Experimental Troupe understood that it is not enough to rely on a good voice. To improve, to perform better, they must also practice body movements and learn dance. Even singing, it is not enough to just sing according to the old tunes, without understanding musical notation. They have to learn musical notation. Yue Opera will be developed into Jiangnan song and dance opera in the future. How can it be developed without practicing singing, dancing, and performance techniques?

    The Shanghai Opera artists have always believed that "Shanghai Opera is the best at performing modern plays." This complacency was almost swept away after watching the performance of "Little Son-in-Law" in the Northeast region. Why is it that when we perform plays that express the life of modern working people, we portray workers and peasants as petty citizens, while "Little Son-in-Law" is better at expressing the true image of peasants? When the Northeast delegation went to Shanghai to perform, the Shanghai People's Shanghai Opera Troupe invited the actors of "Little Son-in-Law" to hold a discussion. The Northeast artists not only told them about their experience in grasping the character and thoughts and feelings of the characters, but more importantly, narrated their own process of understanding and grasping the thoughts and feelings of the working people, that is, the process of their own ideological transformation. In the past, the Shanghai Opera Troupe actors thought that they could not perform workers well, they did not dare to perform soldiers, and they were always confident in performing peasants. But now, they see that they have not performed peasants well either? If they pick up a hoe and turn the hoe head up, the peasants will say at a glance that this is not a peasant. The artists also more deeply realized that without being in touch with real life, acting skills cannot be improved at all.

    However, the new atmosphere generated under the influence of the National Opera Festival is still in a budding and spontaneous state. In this regard, the leadership of opera reform work in East China and Shanghai has shortcomings. After returning from the festival, only one conference was held to convey the information, and no further organization and leadership of the opera circles (including private troupes) was systematically and separately carried out to study and discuss according to the spirit and requirements of the National Opera Festival. At the same time, because the three public troupes in Shanghai represented the East China region in participating in the festival, and were not selected from various provinces, the good influence of the festival was very limited. This limitation has not been overcome, and therefore this good influence has not spread to various provinces and the entire opera circle, becoming an important force to promote the opera reform work in various places to move forward. And this weakness will also weaken those budding and spontaneous good phenomena mentioned above, which is also worth noting.

### 全国戏曲会演对华东戏曲界的影响

    全国戏曲会演对华东戏曲界的影响
    钟洛
    第一届全国戏曲观摩演出大会以后，在参加会演的华东各公营剧团和华东各地的戏曲改革工作中出现了一些可喜的新气象。
    向优良的民族戏曲艺术遗产学习
    全国戏曲会演集中地展览了几百年来民族戏曲的一部分优良遗产，使参加会演的华东戏曲改革工作干部和艺人们大大地开拓了眼界。面对着祖国艺术遗产的海洋，他们感到自己所做的是多么渺小。对部分干部和艺人说来，向优良的民族戏曲遗产学习，已从过去口头上的承认，开始进入到实践的阶段了。
    华东各地过去审定旧剧目的工作是做得很不够的，因而没有能及时地改变各地演出上的混乱现象。会演中各地区演出的优秀传统剧目，启发了戏曲工作者首先是领导干部对这一工作的重视。江苏省和上海市的戏曲改革工作的领导干部，都开始和艺人合作，进行对旧剧目的审定工作。上海市文化局也向私营剧团推荐了会演中的优秀剧目。山东省采取了“下海摸鱼”的方法，派遣干部深入到吕剧的一个剧团中去，系统地做些调查研究工作。这些工作都是必要的。譬如说：江淮剧原是有很多好的剧目的，到了上海以后，受了京剧连台本戏的影响，就把那些剧目抛弃了。淮剧艺人在北京看了西南区和中南区都演了很多好的老戏，才想起他们自己也有不少老戏可演。他们回来向淮剧界传达后，大家对整理老戏才比较重视。对江淮剧和淮扬剧旧有剧目和民间小戏的整理工作，已由上海市文化局艺术事业管理处创作室作为今年工作重点之一。
    有些地方剧种在进入城市后，和农村的联系就渐渐疏远以至割断。这也使艺术的提高缺少了一个重要的基础。华东越剧实验剧团在参加会演以后，到浙东嵊县一带“越剧故乡”去作了一个多月的演出和观摩。从观摩农村剧团的演出中，他们发现越剧的曲调，比他们现在所演唱的要丰富得多。而且农村剧团演越剧，大都是男女合演的。越剧团在新昌观摩了调腔班、木偶戏等剧种，在金华观摩婺剧和睦剧。婺剧的曲调有八百多种，常用的就有一百多。这次已经把这些曲调用录音和乐谱记录下来，无疑将为越剧在音乐艺术上增加新的血液。越剧团还从农村剧团中选拔了十个演技比较好的男演员，作试行男女合演的准备。
    热爱艺术劳动，重视自己的光荣任务
    全国戏曲会演使每一个戏曲工作者感觉到自己对国家和人民所负的责任的重大。当他们懂得自己的艺术劳动在广大人民的精神生活中起着重大影响的时候，他们感到愉快、兴奋和光荣。
    拿沪剧来说，长时期以来，沪剧艺人对反映现代生活的演出方针，是没有完全想通的。即使在公营的上海市人民沪剧团中，也曾有人认为：“为什么我们就不能演古装戏呢？难道说我们演不好吗？”“越剧演古装戏，又受欢迎，又卖座。”去年，他们是带着这种思想去北京的。其他地区兄弟剧种演出的现代剧，给他们以很大的鼓舞；他们自己演出的“罗汉钱”受到赞扬并且得了奖，这就打开了他们思想上的结。表现现代人民生活是多光荣的任务啊，而沪剧又是适合于表现现代生活的剧种之一。最近，公营的沪剧团在上海、无锡等地演出“罗汉钱”和其他新戏，都受到工人和农民的欢迎。在上海郊区作露天演出时，四乡农民从一、二十里路外冒着寒风赶来站了几个钟头。沪剧艺人们在亲身实践中，体会到人民对表现新生活新人物的戏曲，是十分欢迎的，群众的爱好使艺人们对沪剧表现现代生活的路子不再怀疑了。
    这种光荣感和责任感，更因为党和国家对戏曲和艺人的重视而加强了。记者访问了参加会演的越剧、沪剧和淮剧艺人们，从每一个人的即使是简短的谈话里，都无例外地透露出那种不仅是喜悦、而且是热爱自己艺术劳动的情绪。淮剧艺人们向记者叙说了淮剧在解放以前是没人重视的，只能在上海市郊棚户区演，淮剧艺人们做梦也没有想到能去北京，演给毛主席和中央各负责同志看，演给文艺界专家们看。首长们对戏曲和艺人们的关怀，对大家来说，是一种比什么都宝贵的鼓励。艺人们都说：“在听到得奖的时候，真是有一种说不出的感觉，又高兴，又惭愧！”回到上海以后，他们都向领导上提出要求，要求加强学习，要求改进工作制度，要求不断提高自己的思想水平和艺术水平。他们逐渐认识到只有这样，才能无愧于人民戏曲工作者的光荣称号。
    向优秀的表演技术学习
    参加会演的华东艺人们观摩了在艺术创造上的优秀技术，受到很大的启发和教育。那些多种多样的精湛的表演技术，是各剧种的艺术家们为了真实地表现生活，经历了悠久的岁月，和无数前辈艺术家的劳动，用无数心血换来的结晶。而这些优秀的表演技术，却正是华东的艺人们所需要的。
    许多年青的演员，从来就认为一条天生的好嗓子可以走遍天下，练功夫对于他们是件新奇的事。即使嗓子，也不懂得去保护，去进行科学的训练，以致上台不多天就变了音。参加会演回来，华东越剧实验剧团的许多演员懂得了单靠嗓子好是不行了，要进步，要演得更好，还要练身段，学舞蹈。即使唱，光是照老调子唱，不懂乐谱，也是不行的，要学乐谱。越剧将来是要发展成为江南歌舞剧的，不练歌，不练舞，不练表演技术，怎么能发展呢？
    沪剧的艺人们过去一直认为“演时装戏，沪剧第一”。这种自满情绪，在看了东北区的“小女婿”的演出后，几乎一扫而光。同样是表现现代劳动人民生活的戏，为什么我们演起来，就会把工人、农民都演成小市民，而“小女婿”就比较能表现真实的农民形象呢？东北代表团去上海演出时，上海市人民沪剧团邀请了“小女婿”的演员们开了一次座谈会。东北的艺人们不仅告诉他们掌握人物性格和思想感情的经验，更重要的，是叙述了自己体会和掌握劳动人民思想感情的过程，也就是自己思想改造的过程。沪剧团演员们过去以为演工人演不好，演战士不敢演，演农民总是有把握的。可是现在一看，又何尝把农民演好？提个锄头，镢头朝上，农民一看就说这哪儿是农民。艺人们也就更深切地体会到：脱离生活实际，演技是怎么也提不高的。
    但是，在全国戏曲会演影响下所产生的新气象，还是停留在萌芽和自发的状态。在这方面，华东和上海戏曲改革工作领导上是有缺点的。会演回来后，只开了一次大会，作了传达，没有进一步根据全国戏曲会演的精神和要求，系统地、分门别类地组织和领导戏曲界（包括私营剧团在内）进行学习和讨论。同时，又因为代表华东区参加会演的，只是在上海的三个公营剧团，不是从各省选拔出来的，会演的良好影响，就带有很大的局限性。这个局限性没有得到克服，因而没有使这种好的影响遍及各省，遍及整个戏曲界，成为推动各地戏曲改革工作向前迈进一步的重要力量。而这一弱点，同样又会减弱上面所说的那些萌芽的、自发的好的现象，这也是值得注意的。
