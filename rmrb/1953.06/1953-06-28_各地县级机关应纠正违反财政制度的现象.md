Local County-Level Agencies Should Rectify Violations of Financial Regulations

Currently, many county-level leading agencies still exhibit serious violations of financial regulations. Some agencies and units fail to implement the "Decision on Unified Handling of Agency Production" promulgated by the Central People's Government's State Council as early as March 1952. For example, after the Gan County People's Government in Jiangxi Province established an agency production handling committee, it misappropriated 30 million yuan in donations for the Resist America, Aid Korea campaign to lend at high interest rates, earning over 13 million yuan in interest in four months. The county also overdrawed over 200,000 jin of local grain from the national treasury and sold it for business purposes. County Chief Cheng Yuantai spent 2.4 million yuan of public funds to decorate his room, purchasing sofas, coffee tables, lamps, glass smoking sets, and glass cabinets at will. The Xinfeng County Government in the same province transferred the original 200 million yuan of agency production funds to new production departments, and the County Finance and Economics Committee also arbitrarily approved the use of over 190 million yuan of local funds for production. In Jilin Province, a check of four units in Shulan County revealed that three of them had small public treasuries; the County Committee Secretariat still retains over 73 million yuan in materials and outstanding debts. Many counties in Heilongjiang, Sichuan, Anhui, and Guangdong still engage in small public treasuries, setting up small safes, and keeping small accounts.

Some agencies and units adopt various methods to evade the bank's freezing of year-end surplus funds. In Sichuan's Liangping County, Cui Boqun, the head of the Finance Section of the People's Government, and Wang Kaizhen, the head of the Culture and Education Section, instructed two county-run middle schools at the end of the year to retroactively supplement construction plans, forcibly withdrawing 346.6 million yuan from the bank's surplus funds. These funds were spent recklessly after they were received. The two middle schools, which had no electrical lighting, bought two electric meters and left them idle. The Hunchun County in Jilin Province planned to buy a horse-drawn carriage in 1953, estimated to cost tens of millions of yuan, so they reported it in the 1952 final accounts in advance.

Some counties do not construct basic infrastructure according to approved plans, violating financial regulations. Zhang Zhan, the county chief of Xinfeng County in Guangdong Province, used 30 million yuan of funds without the approval of higher authorities to build a large auditorium and repair his bedroom. The Enterprise Company of the Helong County People's Government in Jilin Province built extra-plan projects totaling over 400 million yuan without the approval of higher authorities. The Hunchun County Government in Jilin Province was approved by the provincial government to allocate 178 million yuan to build an oil press, but actually spent 312 million yuan. Many counties also have chaotic expenditures on operating expenses. For example, the Xinjian County People's Government in Jiangxi Province withdrew 9 million yuan in epidemic prevention funds to use as expenses for the county's meetings.

Some provincial (municipal) people's governments have now begun to pay attention to this issue and have conducted inspections to correct these violations of financial regulations. However, the leading agencies in some areas are still turning a blind eye to this phenomenon. In order to ensure the realization of this year's budget, financial supervision departments at all levels must strengthen the supervision of county-level financial work. (Liu Zijing)

### 各地县级机关应纠正违反财政制度的现象

    各地县级机关应纠正违反财政制度的现象
    目前不少县级领导机关违反财政制度的现象还很严重。有些机关单位不执行中央人民政府政务院早在一九五二年三月公布的“关于统一处理机关生产的决定”。如江西省赣县人民政府在成立机关生产处理委员会后，竟挪用人民捐献的抗美援朝款项三千万元放高利贷，四个月时间得利息一千三百余万元；该县并向国库借支地方粮二十余万斤，变卖后拿来做买卖。县长程远太为了装饰他的房间，随便购买沙发、茶几、灯台、玻璃烟具及玻璃柜等，花掉公款二百四十余万元。该省信丰县政府把原来机关生产资金两亿元转入新的生产部门，县财经委员会又擅自批准动用地方经费一亿九千余万元投入生产。吉林省舒兰县检查了四个单位，就有三个单位有小公家务，县委会秘书处至今仍保留了七千三百余万元的物资和外欠账款。黑龙江、四川、安徽、广东许多县仍搞小公家务，设小柜，立小账。
    有些机关单位，是采取各种各样方式，逃避银行对年终结余资金的冻结。四川梁平县人民政府财政科长崔勃群，文教科长王开震在年终时指使两个县立中学追补修建计划，强从银行提取结余款三亿四千六百余万元。这些款子领到后都胡乱开支了。该两中学没有电灯设备，但也买两个电表闲放着。吉林省珲春县计划在一九五三年买一台马车，估价数千万元，就先在一九五二年报了决算。
    有些县基本建设不按批准的计划施工，违反财政制度的。广东新丰县县长张战不经上级批准，擅自动用经费三千万元修建大礼堂，并给自己修理卧室。吉林省和龙县人民政府企业公司未经上级批准修建计划以外工程达四亿余万元。吉林省珲春县政府建造榨油厂经省政府批准拨款一亿七千八百万元，但实花了三亿一千二百余万元。不少县对事业费的开支也很混乱。如江西省新建县人民政府抽出防疫经费九百万元，作为该县开会的费用。
    现在有些省（市）人民政府已开始注意这一问题，并进行了检查，以纠正这些违反财政制度的现象。但尚有些地区的领导机关对这种现象还熟视无睹。为了保证今年预算的实现，各级财政监察部门必须加强县级财政工作的监督。（刘子敬）
