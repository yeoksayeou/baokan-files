Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, June 2nd: Indian newspapers are increasingly expressing dissatisfaction with the large number of American "teachers," "scholars," and various "experts" infiltrating various sectors of national life. "The National Herald" has published a series of articles commenting on this matter.

The bourgeois newspaper "People's Weekly," commenting on the activities of foreigners at an American-run university in Uttar Pradesh, stated that public opinion is deeply convinced that these scientific researchers are not what they pretend to be. They are actually American spies who are using the pretext of conducting scientific research to collect valuable intelligence for the United States.

    不满美国特务到印度活动
    【新华社二日讯】塔斯社新德里二日讯：印度报纸对于大批的美国“教师”、“学者”和各式各样的“专家”渗入国民生活的各部门，已愈来愈表示不满。“国民先驱报”登载了一系列的文章评论这件事。
    资产阶级报纸“人民周刊”评论在北方省美国人办的大学里外国人的活动说，舆论界已深信，这些科学研究者并不如他们所假装的那样，他们实际上是藉口进行科学研究工作而为美国搜集有价值的情报的美国间谍。
