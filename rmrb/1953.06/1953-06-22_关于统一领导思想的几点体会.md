Some Experiences Regarding the Unified Leadership Thought
Chen Junjie, Secretary of the Party Committee of the State-Owned邯郸 No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory

Our factory is a newly built cotton textile factory. The leading cadres in the factory were newly transferred from rural posts and lacked experience in enterprise management. More than 90% of the textile workers were also newly arrived from the countryside, and they were deeply influenced by the free and undisciplined thinking of small-scale farmers. However, because we learned from the experience of Factory 53, we gradually overcame our shortcomings, which allowed our work to gradually get on track. Since the official commencement of production in 1953, we have been completing and overfulfilling the state's production tasks ahead of schedule on a ten-day and monthly basis. Recently, we have greatly surpassed the state's various planned targets. For example, in April, the average spindle speed exceeded the state's planned target by 1.43%, and the average loom speed exceeded the state's planned target by 1.51%. The increase in output was the most significant. In April, the yarn's spindle-hour production exceeded the state's planned target by 7.9%, and in May, the cloth's loom-hour production exceeded the state's planned target by 19%. Product quality also improved rapidly, with the percentage of first-grade cloth exceeding the state's planned target by more than 4% in May. Since March, costs have also gradually decreased, and the actual cost in April was 5.95% lower than the planned cost.

Since the People's Daily introduced the experience of Factory 53, we immediately organized cadres to study it. Soon after, the Hebei Provincial Party Committee issued the "Decision on Learning and Promoting the Experience of Factory 53," which further promoted our learning to become more systematic and in-depth. After studying the experience of Factory 53, we deeply realized that the Party, administrative, trade union, and Communist Youth League cadres in industrial and mining enterprises must be ideologically and in work steps coordinated and consistent, and the unity and concentration of leadership must be strengthened.

To unify the thinking and work steps of the Party, administrative, trade union, and Communist Youth League leading cadres, we must first establish the ideology of relying on the working class and facing production among the leading cadres. This is an important principle and foundation for unifying thinking and work steps. The specific method for unifying thinking and work steps is to organize cadres to study the Party's policies and the instructions and resolutions of higher-level leading organs. For example, when mobilizing the masses to revise the production plan in April, the factory Party committee led cadres above the section chief and workshop director level in studying the documents of the Provincial Party Committee's industrial conference. The Party committee and administrative responsible cadres respectively made reports at cadre meetings, followed by organized discussions. In addition, lectures on issues related to planning management were also held. Through a series of studies, the thinking of the Party, administrative, trade union, and Communist Youth League cadres was unified, enabling the cadres to further recognize the important significance of mobilizing the masses to revise the plan and implement plan management. Recently, in order to strengthen plan management work, in addition to continuing to organize cadres for further study of plan management, three training classes have been held on statistical recording, work plans, and quota responsibility systems, and leading cadres at all levels of the Party, government, trade union, and Communist Youth League have been absorbed to attend lectures, so as to achieve close cooperation and consistent steps among various departments in specific implementation.

In studying the experience of Factory 53, we also realized that conscientiously carrying out criticism and self-criticism is a powerful weapon for unifying thinking and work steps. The levels of Party, administrative, trade union, and Communist Youth League cadres are different, and their understanding of the situation is also different. Therefore, differences in understanding of some issues are inevitable. However, we exchange information, conduct discussions, and achieve ideological unity. In the past, during the period of basic construction, the relationship between the Party, government, trade union, and Communist Youth League in our factory was not coordinated enough. The main reason was that some leading cadres' understanding of relying on the working class was limited to conceptual understanding and lacked concrete experience. Therefore, they were unable to solve specific problems when encountering them. For example, cadres transferred from the local area to the factory saw that some old workers and technicians also had certain shortcomings, and felt "uncomfortable," so they did not pay attention to uniting and educating them. After studying the experience of Factory 53, they criticized erroneous thinking and realized that it is necessary to strengthen the education of the worker masses, turn the factory into a school, and actively improve the consciousness of the working class. For example, regarding the issue of improving the staff canteen, some people advocated immediately adding all the equipment, without considering that the new factory had not been in operation for long and had not yet obtained the factory director's fund. If all the equipment were added at once, it would inevitably increase production costs and affect product sales. After studying the experience of Factory 53, everyone clearly realized that the living welfare of staff and workers must be gradually improved and raised under the condition of continuous development of production. According to our experience, if there are differences in understanding caused by the different situations understood by the cadres, this is easy to resolve. However, if some cadres are mixed with personal emotions, causing unprincipled disputes, and the leadership is unable to keenly point out the problems, it may make the problem tangled. Therefore, in carrying out criticism and self-criticism, we must prevent unprincipled disputes and adhere to principled unity.

The unity of thought and action among Party, administrative, trade union, and Communist Youth League cadres must be guaranteed by a certain system. We have established and adhered to a system of holding a Party committee meeting once a week to centrally solve the working principles for a certain period; and established a "brainstorming session" system for the standing committee of the factory management committee to solve specific problems in daily work. At the same time, it is also stipulated that the work plans of various departments are generally discussed by the Party committee to ensure the consistency of work steps. In addition, the meeting system of various departments is strictly controlled, and the spare time of staff and workers is uniformly allocated, so that various tasks can be carried out in an orderly manner.

We believe that concentrating efforts to solve key problems in production is a concrete manifestation of the Party, administration, trade union, and Communist Youth League "acting in unison and facing production," and it is also an important link in learning from the experience of Factory 53. During the partial commencement of the factory, we concentrated our efforts to solve the problem of "second-grade cloth." The resounding slogan of "opposing waste and reducing defective products" became the actual actions of the workers. Thanks to the joint efforts of cadres from the Party, administrative, trade union, and Communist Youth League systems, by the end of January, the percentage of first-grade cloth had increased from an average of 34.43% to an average of 75.2%, and a new record of 88.28% of first-grade cloth was created. Since March, on the basis of continuing to consolidate and improve product quality, we decided to focus our work on solving the problem of reducing cotton consumption. By carrying out the struggle against bureaucracy, we overcame waste and the phenomenon of no one being responsible. As a result, cotton consumption was reduced by 0.267% compared to February, thereby completing the cost plan. In May, in order to achieve balanced production, we mobilized the masses to carry out the work of signing contact contracts, which played an important role in ensuring the completion of the production plan.

Through studying the experience of Factory 53, we have put production and various tasks on the right track. However, due to the short time since the factory was built, there are too many urgent problems that need to be solved. Therefore, the achievements we have made are not stable enough. If our work in the past mainly focused on solving the problem of unifying thinking and unifying leadership, then in the future we must concentrate our efforts to strengthen the labor discipline education of workers and overcome their free and undisciplined habits brought from the countryside. We must strengthen the construction of various organizations, consolidate and develop existing achievements, and strive to push our production management work forward.

    关于统一领导思想的几点体会
    中共国营邯郸第一棉纺织厂党委会书记　陈俊杰
    我厂是一座新建的棉纺织工厂。厂里的领导干部，刚从农村岗位上调来，缺乏企业管理工作经验。百分之九十以上的纺织工人也是刚从农村中来的，农民小生产者的自由散漫思想影响很深。但是，由于我们学习了五三工厂的经验，逐步克服着我们的缺点，这就使我们的工作渐渐走上轨道。自一九五三年正式进行生产以来，我们一直是按旬按月地完成和提前超额完成国家生产任务，近来更大大地突破了国家的各项计划指标。以四月份为例，纱锭平均运转率超过国家计划指标百分之一点四三，布机平均运转率超过国家计划指标百分之一点五一。产量的提高最为显著，四月份纱的锭时产量超过国家计划指标百分之七点九，五月份布的台时产量超过国家计划指标百分之十九。产品质量也提高的很快，五月份的正布率超过国家计划指标百分之四以上。三月份以来成本也逐渐降低，四月份实际成本已低于计划成本的百分之五点九五。
    自人民日报介绍了五三工厂的经验后，我们立即组织了干部进行学习。不久，中共河北省委会又发布了“关于学习和推广五三工厂经验的决定”，这就进一步推动了我们的学习走向比较有系统和比较深入。我们经过学习五三工厂的经验，深深体会到：工矿企业中的党、行政、工会、青年团干部在思想上和工作步调上必须协调一致，必须加强领导的统一性和集中性。
    统一党、行政、工会、青年团领导干部的思想和工作步调，首先必须在领导干部中树立依靠工人阶级、面向生产的思想，这是统一思想和工作步调的重要原则和基础。统一思想和工作步调的具体方法，便是组织干部学习党的政策和上级领导机关的指示和决议。例如，在四月份发动群众修订生产计划时，工厂党委领导了科长、车间主任以上干部，学习省委工业会议的文件，党委和行政负责干部分别在干部会上作了报告，会后组织了讨论，此外又举办了有关计划管理问题的讲座。经过一连串的学习，统一了党、行政、工会、青年团干部的思想，使干部进一步认识了发动群众修订计划、实行计划管理的重要意义。最近，为了加强计划管理工作，除了继续组织干部对计划管理作进一步的学习外，又举办了统计记录、作业计划和定额责任制等三个训练班，并吸收党、政、工、团各级领导干部参加听讲，以便在具体执行中取得各部门的密切配合，步调一致。
    在学习五三工厂的经验中，我们还体会到：认真地开展批评和自我批评，是统一思想和工作步调的有力武器。党、行政、工会、青年团干部间的水平不同，对情况的了解也不一样，因此对有些问题的认识就不免发生分歧。但是，我们经过交换情况，展开讨论，达到思想的统一。过去，在基本建设期间，我们厂的党、政、工、团之间的关系是不够协调的，主要原因是某些领导干部对于依靠工人阶级只限于概念的了解，缺乏具体的体会，因而遇到具体问题便无法解决。比如：由地方转入工厂的干部，看到个别老工人和技术人员也存在着某些缺点，就觉着“不顺劲”，因而也不注意去团结教育他们。经过对五三工厂经验的学习，批判了错误思想，认识到必须加强对工人群众的教育工作，把工厂变成学校，积极地提高工人阶级的觉悟。又如，关于改善职工食堂问题，有的人主张立即增添全部设备，而没有考虑到新工厂开工不久，还没有获得厂长基金，如果一下子增添全部设备，势必增高生产成本，影响产品的畅销。经过学习五三工厂经验，大家明确地认识到职工生活福利问题必须在生产不断发展的情况下，才能逐步改善和提高。根据我们的体验，如果由于干部间所了解的情况不同而产生的认识上的分歧，这是容易解决的。但是，如果某些干部掺杂着个人意气，引起无原则的纠纷，而领导方面又不能敏锐地指出，就可能使问题纠缠不清；因此，我们在开展批评和自我批评中，必须防止无原则的争论，坚持原则性的统一。
    党、行政、工会、青年团干部之间思想和步调的统一，必须有一定的制度来保证。我们曾建立和坚持了每周召开一次党委会议的制度，集中解决一定时期的工作方针问题；并且建立了工厂管理委员会常委的“碰头会”制度，解决日常工作中的具体问题。同时又规定各部的工作计划，一般都经过党委会讨论，以保证工作步调的一致。此外，还严格控制各部门的会议制度，统一分配职工业余活动时间，使各项工作有秩序地进行。
    我们觉得集中力量解决生产中的关键问题，是党、行政、工会、青年团“行动一致，面向生产”的具体表现，也是学习五三工厂经验的一个重要环节。在工厂部分开工期间，我们曾集中力量解决“次布”问题，“反对浪费，减少次品”的响亮口号，变成了工人的实际行动。由于党、行政、工会、青年团等系统干部大家动手，至一月底，正布率已由平均百分之三十四点四三，提高到平均百分之七十五点二，并创造了正布率高达百分之八十八点二八的新纪录。三月份以来，我们在继续巩固和提高产品质量的基础上，决定将工作重点放在解决降低用棉量的问题上，通过开展反官僚主义的斗争，来克服浪费和无人负责现象，这样做的结果，用棉量较二月份降低了百分之零点二六七，从而完成了成本计划。五月份，为实现均衡生产，我们又发动群众进行签订联系合同的工作，这一工作对于保证生产计划的完成起了重要作用。
    我们通过学习五三工厂经验，虽然使生产和各种工作走上了正规，但是由于建厂不久，迫切需要解决的问题太多，所以，我们获得的成绩还不够稳固。如果说过去我们的工作重点主要是解决统一思想统一领导问题，那么今后我们必须集中力量加强对工人的劳动纪律教育，克服他们由农村带来的小生产者自由散漫的习气。加强各个组织的建设工作，巩固和发展既有的成果，争取把我们的生产管理工作向前推进一步。
