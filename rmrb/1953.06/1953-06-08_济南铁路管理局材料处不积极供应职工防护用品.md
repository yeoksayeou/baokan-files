    Jinan Railway Bureau Material Section Fails to Actively Supply Employee Protective Equipment
    Huang Yinglin writes: The Jinan Railway Bureau Material Section and its subordinate material factories adopt an irresponsible attitude towards the supply of employee labor protection equipment. The labor protection equipment of railway employees should be supplied by the material departments, and the Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government has explicit regulations. The Jinan Railway Bureau Material Section issued a notice on March 3 this year stating: "Determined to implement this regulation." However, the labor protection equipment for employees of the locomotive department is still nowhere to be found, and employees have many complaints.
    The application for labor protection equipment from the locomotive department was sent to the Material Section on March 19, and it was originally agreed that it would be issued to employees for use by early May at the latest. However, no labor protection equipment has been issued to date. Employees have repeatedly called the material factories, and they always just "hum" and "haw"; when asking the Material Section, their reply is "the factories are very busy" and "procurement is difficult." How strange! Is the supply of labor protection equipment, which is related to the health of thousands of employees, work outside of the scope of their duties? Procurement difficulties are also untrue. The Bengbu and Jiulonggang locomotive depots, due to waiting for a long time, sent their own labor protection officers to Shanghai to place orders, and the goods were delivered in late May. The facts fully prove that the Jinan Railway Bureau Material Section does not pay attention to and is irresponsible for the supply of employee labor protection equipment.
    Because the Material Section's supply of protective equipment is not timely, some units have had to ask labor protection officers to put down their work and go to other places to purchase it, which has resulted in no one being responsible for on-site safety technology and labor protection work; some units, although they have not automatically sent people to purchase it, have suffered damage to the health of their employees. It is hoped that the Jinan Railway Bureau Material Section will quickly check this work.

### 济南铁路管理局材料处不积极供应职工防护用品

    济南铁路管理局材料处不积极供应职工防护用品
    黄英麟来信：济南铁路管理局材料处和所属各材料厂对供应职工劳动保护用品工作采取不负责任态度。铁路职工的劳动保护用品，应该由材料部门负责供应，中央人民政府铁道部已有明文规定。济南铁路管理局材料处今年三月三日发出通知说：“决心执行这一规定”。可是到现在机务部门职工的劳动保护用品仍然没有下落，职工意见纷纷。
    机务部门领劳动保护用品的申请书是三月十九日送达材料处的，原来商定最迟五月上旬发给职工应用。可是到现在劳动保护用品一件也没有发下来。职工们多次以电话问各材料厂，他们总是“哼”
    “哈”了事；问材料处，他们的答复是“各厂业务很忙”，“采购困难”。好奇怪！难道关系着上千名职工身体健康的劳动保护用品的供应是业务以外的工作吗？采购困难也非事实。蚌埠和九龙岗两个机务段由于久等不来，自己派劳动保护员赴上海订货，五月下旬即交了货。事实完全证明济南铁路管理局材料处对供应职工劳动保护用品工作不重视和不负责任。
    由于材料处对防护用品供应不及时，有的单位不得不叫劳动保护员放下工作赴外埠采购，这就造成现场的安全技术劳动保护工作无人负责；有的单位虽没有自动去人采购，但职工身体健康就受到了损害。希望济南铁路管理局材料处赶紧检查这一工作。
