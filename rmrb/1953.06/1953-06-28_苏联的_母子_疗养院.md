    苏联的“母子”疗养院
    据新华社莫斯科讯：全苏工会中央理事会所属的阿塞拜疆休养所和疗养院管理处在巴库的阿普歇伦半岛最美丽的地方马达基安尼城设有一个“母子”疗养院，专门供给带婴孩的母亲休养。疗养院是一座面向里海的两层新楼。疗养院有专门婴孩室。在婴孩室内，有由儿科医生指导的护士和保育员照顾婴孩。同婴孩室邻接的是喂乳室。母亲们在那里听讲演，同医生谈话，学习科学的喂乳知识和预防儿童疾病的知识。疗养院备有各种最新式的医疗设备。来休养的母亲每天六餐，菜单中尤以牛奶制成品最多。
    现在，这个环境幽美的“母子”疗养院，每天都接待着许多来自巴库、莫洛托夫、莫斯科、列宁格勒等城市的母亲和婴儿们。
