After Seeing the Movie "Light Shines on Tibet"
　　Fei Xiaotong "Light Shines on Tibet" is a documentary film that tells the story of the Tibetan people gaining a new life under the radiant light of the Communist Party's ethnic policy.
　　Although Tibet is a familiar place name, many people know it as the roof of the world and the southwestern frontier of our motherland. However, due to the remote distance and the obstruction of high mountains and great rivers, this beautiful land has rarely been seen by people outside of Tibet. The film "Light Shines on Tibet" broadens people's horizons and makes them realize that Tibet is originally a fertile and beautiful land, with magnificent rivers and mountains, inhabited by creative Tibetan people. On the screen, we see the hardworking Tibetan people opening up fields on this plateau, domesticating cattle and sheep, and building magnificent temples everywhere. The great and magnificent thirteen-story Potala Palace is a great creation of the Tibetan people's wisdom and artistic genius. Like those depicted on the murals of the Potala Palace, the Tibetan working people carried stones from the ground, stone by stone, up to the mountain top, and built this beautiful palace after a thousand years of continuous construction. Labor creates civilization, and the Tibetan people, like other fraternal ethnic groups, are hardworking and have excellent cultural traditions.
　　This magnificent land and this hardworking ethnic group suffered greatly before liberation. The Tibetan people's heroic resistance against imperialist aggression was betrayed by the Qing Dynasty court at that time, and thus had no effect. On the screen, we see Gyantse city, which was looted by British imperialism in 1904, we see the ruins of villages burned down by imperialist aggressors—the broken walls and ruins of fortresses, we see the blockhouses from which the Tibetan people once resisted the invaders. These relics demonstrate the Tibetan people's hatred of the invaders and their love for the motherland.
　　The audience relived some major events of the past three years on the screen. The delegation of the Tibetan local government came to Beijing, and the "Agreement on Measures for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet" was signed. Amidst the pleasant music, everyone concretely and intimately saw that the great Chairman Mao's ethnic policy, like the sun, drove away the long night that shrouded the southwestern corner of our motherland. From then on, the Tibetan people were forever freed from the shackles of imperialism and returned to our equal, friendly, mutually helpful, and united big family of the motherland. Light began to shine on Tibet!
　　The lovely and respectable People's Liberation Army, carrying out Chairman Mao's orders and realizing the will of the people of the whole country, set off for Tibet with the warm support and cheers of the Tibetan people to defend our national defense and the interests of the Tibetan people.
　　They crossed primeval forests, traversed snow-capped mountains, and crossed turbulent rivers and streams. Where there were no roads, they forged paths; where there were no inhabitants, they created villages. On the top of Danda Mountain, they wrote heroic poems: "Danda Mountain is sixty-three, the first dangerous pass in the march into Tibet. Heroes trample through three feet of snow, and their heroic spirit shatters the American imperialists' courage."
　　We saw the arduous march and the severe struggle with nature. But do not forget that all this is inseparable from the crimes of imperialism and reactionary rule in the past. On the one hand, they cruelly exploited the Tibetan people, causing poverty and leaving fertile land barren and abundant resources buried; on the other hand, they did everything possible to isolate Tibet from the motherland. The Han and Tibetan peoples originally had ample ability to overcome natural obstacles, but the opening of transportation routes had always been hindered. The imperialists even fabricated all kinds of rumors to make travelers hesitate and psychologically succumb to their conspiracies. Our heroic People's Army uncovered the truth, overcame difficulties, and entered Tibet to carry out the task of defending the border. Our People's Liberation Army is not only a tenacious fighting force, but also a strong production force. In order to pave the way for future exchanges between the people of the two ethnic groups, our soldiers, with guns in one hand and pickaxes in the other, opened mountains and built bridges, marching towards Lhasa while digging pits and sowing seeds of trees. After entering Tibet, they also built farms, dug canals, and built dams in heroic postures, turning barren wilderness into fertile fields.
　　The entry of the People's Liberation Army into Tibet not only consolidated the national defense of our multi-ethnic family, but also protected the interests of the Tibetan people. Chairman Mao's glory brought unprecedented joy and encouragement to the broad masses of Tibetan people, realizing their long-awaited unity and development. We saw the joy and gratitude expressed by the Tibetan people in the film when welcoming the People's Liberation Army and welcoming the return of the Panchen Erdeni to Tibet, and the great image of Chairman Mao immediately emerged in our minds. We rejoiced like the Tibetan people, shouting "Long live Chairman Mao!" This was shouted from the bottom of our hearts, and no force could suppress this voice. This voice is: Tibet has changed its face. Solid highland barley has grown on the land, and fat lambs are running on the pasture. The long-sick have regained their health, and the barren have had children. What is described in the classics, recited every day but never seen, has been realized before our eyes. "This is our living Buddha," who can say it is not?
　　This is the beginning of light, and the hearts of the Tibetan people are bright: under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, their diligence and piety will create a new Tibet that is even greater and more magnificent than the Potala Palace, and will bring greater glory and pride to our great family of the motherland.

### 看电影“光明照耀着西藏”以后

    看电影“光明照耀着西藏”以后
    费孝通 “光明照耀着西藏”是一部叙述西藏人民在共产党的民族政策的光辉照耀下，获得新生的纪录影片。
    西藏虽则是大家熟悉的地名，很多人知道这是世界的屋脊，这是我们祖国西南的边疆。但是由于遥远的距离、高山大川重重阻隔，这片美丽的山河，很少为西藏以外的人民所见到。影片“光明照耀着西藏”使人们开拓了眼界，认识西藏原来是一片沃美的土地、锦绣的河山，在那里居住着的是富于创造能力的藏族人民。在银幕上，我们看到勤劳的藏族人民在这高原上开辟了田场，驯牧了牛羊，到处修建着雄壮的寺庙。那伟大壮丽的十三层大厦布达拉宫，是藏族人民的智慧和艺术天才的伟大创造。藏族的劳动人民，像在布达拉宫壁画上所绘的一样，从平地上，一块石，一块石地背上山顶，经过了一千年的不断修建，筑成了这座美丽的宫殿。劳动创造了文明，藏族和其他兄弟民族一样都是勤劳而且是有优秀的文化传统的。
    这一片锦绣河山，这一个勤劳的民族，在解放以前曾经饱受灾难。藏族人民对帝国主义的入侵的英勇抵抗，被当时清朝的皇室所出卖，以致没有效果。在银幕上，我们看到了一九○四年被英帝国主义劫掠过的江孜城，我们看到了被帝国主义侵略者烧毁的村庄的遗迹——残堡断垣，我们看到了藏族人民曾经从那里抵抗过侵略者的炮楼。这些遗迹说明了西藏人民对于侵略者的憎恨，对于祖国的热爱。
    观众从银幕上重温了三年来的一些重大事件。西藏地方政府代表团到北京来了，“和平解放西藏办法的协议”签字了。愉快的音乐声中，每一个人具体地，亲切地看到了伟大的毛主席的民族政策像太阳一样，赶走了笼罩在我们祖国西南角上漫长的黑夜。藏族人民从此永远摆脱了帝国主义的羁绊，回到了我们平等、友爱、互助、团结的祖国大家庭里。光明开始照耀着西藏！
    可爱可敬的人民解放军，执行毛主席的命令，实现全国人民的意志，在藏族人民热烈的支援和欢呼下，向西藏出发，保卫我们的国防和西藏人民的利益。
    他们穿过原始森林，跨过终年积雪的高山，越过了滚滚的急流巨川；没有路，走出路来；没有人烟，造出村寨来；丹达山的山顶上写上了英雄的诗歌：“丹达山高六十三，进军西藏第一险，英雄踏破三尺雪，浩气惊碎美帝胆。”
    我们看到了艰苦的进军，和自然的严重的搏斗。但不要忘记这一切和过去帝国主义及反动统治的罪行是分不开的。他们一方面残酷地剥削藏族人民，造成了贫困、使肥沃的土地荒废了，丰富的资源埋没了；另一方面更千方百计地要把西藏地方和祖国隔离。汉藏两族人民原有充分能力去克服自然的阻碍，却一直被阻遏着交通道路的开辟。帝国主义者更捏造种种谣传，使行人裹足，在心理上屈服于他们的阴谋。我们英雄的人民军队，揭开了实情，战胜了困难，进入西藏执行着保卫边疆的任务。我们的人民解放军不但是支顽强的战斗部队，而且是支强大的生产部队，他们为了铺平今后两民族人民间往来的道路，我们的子弟兵，一手拿枪，一手拿镐，逢山开山，逢水搭桥，在走向拉萨的途上一面行军，一面挖坑撒下树木的种子。进入西藏后，又以英雄的姿态建农场，开水渠，修堤修坝，把荒凉的旷野变成一片肥美的田地。
    人民解放军的入藏不但巩固了我们各民族大家庭的国防，而且保护着藏族人民的利益。毛主席的光辉带来西藏广大人民空前的欢欣鼓舞，实现了他们渴望的团结和发展。我们看到电影上藏族人民在欢迎人民解放军和欢迎班禅额尔德尼返藏的时刻所流露的喜悦和感激，我们的心头立刻涌现出毛主席的伟大形象。我们和藏族人民一样欢喜，高呼“毛主席万岁”，这是从心底里喊出来的，没有力量能遏制这个声音。这个声音是：西藏改变了它的面貌。大地上长出了结实的青稞，牧场上奔走着肥胖的羔羊。久病的得到了健康，不孕的得到了孩子。经典上所描述的，天天念诵而没有见到过的，在眼前实现了。“这是我们的活菩萨”，谁还能说不是？
    这是光明的开始，藏族人民心里明亮了：他们的勤劳和虔诚，在中国共产党的领导下，将创造出比布达拉宫更伟大壮丽的新西藏，将为我们伟大祖国的大家庭带来更大的光辉和骄傲。
