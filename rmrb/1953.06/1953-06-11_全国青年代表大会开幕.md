Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: The Second National Youth Congress of the All-China Youth Federation solemnly opened in the capital's Huai Ren Tang on the 10th. This congress is being held as our great motherland begins to enter a period of planned construction. This signifies that the motherland requires Chinese youth, with their revolutionary traditions, to contribute their strength from various positions and, together with the people of the whole country, actively complete the national construction plan and strive for the gradual realization of national industrialization and the gradual transition from new democracy to a socialist society.

The youth representatives attending this congress are very broad in scope. There are representatives from the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Chinese People's Liberation Army who are on the Korean front and guarding the borders of the motherland; there are representatives of workers and peasants from factories and rural areas; there are representatives of various fraternal ethnic groups from the Tibetan Plateau and the Inner Mongolian grasslands; there are representatives from the industrial and commercial sectors and returned overseas Chinese; there are independent laborers in urban areas and young technicians in enterprises; there are representatives from religious circles from monasteries and churches; and there are youth workers from literary and art circles, educational circles, sports circles, and various government agencies, people's organizations, and democratic parties. The Tibetan Youth Visiting Group and the Qamdo Area Youth Visiting Group also attended the congress as observers. This congress strongly demonstrates the great power of the solid unity of young people of all different regions and nationalities, different democratic classes and parties, different religious beliefs, and occupations in our country under the banner of Mao Zedong.

Foreign guests invited to attend the congress included: representatives of the World Federation of Democratic Youth and representatives of youth organizations from the Soviet Union, North Korea, Mongolia, Vietnam, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, Australia, the United Kingdom, and Indonesia, totaling twenty-one people.

The congress elected Piero Pieralli, Secretary of the World Federation of Democratic Youth, Liao Chengzhi, Hu Yaobang, and fifty-two others to the presidium of the congress. At 10:00 a.m., Liao Chengzhi, Executive Chairman of the Congress, announced the official opening of the Congress. At this time, dozens of mercury lamps in the venue shone brightly, and everyone present stood up, cheered, and applauded. The military band played the national anthem and the "Anthem of the World Federation of Democratic Youth." Then, Wu Han, Secretary-General of the All-China Democratic Youth Federation, delivered the opening speech. Wu Han extended a warm welcome to the representatives attending the congress and the foreign guests. After explaining the great significance of this congress, he said: This congress will review the work of the All-China Democratic Youth Federation over the past four years, and in accordance with the current situation and the overall task of the country, determine the guiding principles and tasks of the All-China Democratic Youth Federation in the future. In addition, the congress will also revise the Constitution of the All-China Democratic Youth Federation and re-elect the National Committee of the All-China Democratic Youth Federation. We believe that with the joint efforts of all the representatives, our congress will be very successful, and this congress will further advance our work.

When Rao Shushi, representative of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, delivered a congratulatory speech to the congress (the full text will be published separately), the audience burst into thunderous applause that lasted for a long time. The representatives listened to the Party's valuable instructions with infinite gratitude.

When Lin Boqu, Secretary-General of the Central People's Government, delivered a speech to the congress on behalf of the Central People's Government (the full text will be published separately), the audience applauded warmly.

Chen Shutong, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, delivered a congratulatory speech to the congress (the full text will be published separately). His speech was welcomed by all the representatives.

When Executive Chairman Liao Chengzhi announced that Piero Pieralli, Secretary of the World Federation of Democratic Youth, and A. Slavnov, Vice Chairman of the Soviet Youth Anti-Fascist Committee, would speak, the audience applauded warmly to show their respect to them.

Piero Pieralli conveyed greetings to the congress on behalf of the World Federation of Democratic Youth, which encompasses 75 million young men and women in 88 countries. He said that Chinese youth have made great contributions to the cause of peace in Asia and the world. He pointed out that peace is the most important issue for the people and youth of the world. He said that the agreement on the repatriation of prisoners of war in the Korean armistice negotiations is the most important event in the current international situation. This agreement marks an important stage in the widely concerned issue of the Korean armistice. Today, we are more convinced than ever that the forces of peace will surely triumph.

Piero Pieralli then presented the congress with a green flag symbolizing the great solidarity of world youth and the striving for lasting world peace—the flag of the World Federation of Democratic Youth. Chinese youth will be better united under this banner, advance side by side with the youth of all countries, and struggle for lasting world peace.

Slavnov congratulated the convening of the congress on behalf of the young men and women of the Soviet Union. He said that Soviet youth pay the greatest attention to the achievements of Chinese young men and women in all aspects. He then pointed out that you and we recognize more clearly than the people of any other country how urgently the people engaged in construction need peace. The great and lasting friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union, who account for one-third of the world's population, is a reliable guarantee for maintaining peace in the Far East and the world. Our friendship is a source of strength for progressive youth all over the world, and it consolidates the confidence of the youth of all countries in the final victory of the cause of peace.

Next, A. Slavnov presented the congress with an artistic piece exquisitely made by Soviet artists—a dazzling black lacquer box and a well-known Soviet "Peace" brand radio. These gifts symbolize the ever-strengthening fraternal friendship between the youth of the Soviet Union and China.

Also delivering speeches at the congress this morning were Li Jishen, Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, Zhang Bojun, Vice Chairman of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League, Huang Yanpei, Chairman of the China Democratic National Construction Association, Lai Ruoyu, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, Shi Liang, Vice Chairman of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, and Hu Yaobang, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Youth League. Their speeches were all warmly welcomed by the audience.

The morning session of the congress adjourned after young people from all walks of life in the capital presented flowers to the congress.

At 3:30 p.m., the congress continued. Liao Chengzhi, Chairman of the All-China Democratic Youth Federation, delivered a report to the congress entitled "Strive to Defend the Motherland and Build the Motherland."

Liao Chengzhi said: Since the First National Youth Congress of the All-China Youth Federation in May 1949, our great motherland, under the correct leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong and the Communist Party of China, has undergone profound changes in all aspects, and the face of the motherland has been completely renewed. With the great victories of the country's various tasks, the Chinese youth movement has made important achievements. The awareness of youth has been greatly enhanced, and they love the motherland, the people, labor, and learning more; the hardworking and courageous new style has been established.

Now, our country has entered a period of construction. During the period of construction, the most basic task of the All-China Democratic Youth Federation is, under the leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong and the Communist Party of China, to connect and educate the masses of young people, constantly improve the awareness and organization of the masses of young people, unite the democratic youth of all strata with the Chinese Communist Youth League as the core, and together with the people of the whole country, actively complete the national construction plan, and strive for the gradual realization of national industrialization and the gradual transition to socialism.

In order to fulfill the tasks entrusted to youth by the state, youth must strengthen their studies so that they can have a skill, specialized scientific knowledge, and professional skills, so as to be able to provide practical and effective contributions to the national construction cause in different positions; and they must also have a high degree of political awareness, good moral character, and be loyal to the motherland, the people, and Chairman Mao Zedong's ideals and cause.

We must expand and strengthen the unity of youth and establish a broad united front for youth work. Domestically, we must also pay enough attention to and develop youth work among ethnic minorities, the national bourgeoisie, urban petty bourgeoisie, religious circles, and technical personnel. Internationally, we should strengthen international youth work, unite under the banner of the World Federation of Democratic Youth, strive to learn from the experience of Soviet youth work, strengthen unity with the youth of all countries, and strive for lasting world peace!

Liao Chengzhi said with full confidence: The Chinese youth, who have experienced various severe tests, are strong and courageous. We are prepared to overcome any difficulties on the road ahead and complete the sacred task of building the motherland!

The speech of Zhou Yunchang, representative of the Chinese People's Volunteers, was warmly welcomed by the audience. He said: The vast number of young people in the Chinese People's Volunteers often take the initiative to ask their superiors to give them the most arduous tasks in performing combat missions, and they have successfully completed these tasks. Heroes and model figures with excellent qualities and outstanding achievements are constantly emerging among the youth, and they have created countless earth-shattering and moving heroic deeds. Zhou Yunchang introduced to the conference several heroic and model figures among the volunteer youth representatives attending this conference who had created outstanding achievements. Among them were Huang Jiafu, a special-class merit winner, a first-class blasting hero, and a Communist Party member who single-handedly completed fifteen blasting missions in a certain battle, annihilating more than two hundred enemies, and played a decisive role in the victory of the unit's complete annihilation of more than 610 defending enemies; Lu Min, a first-class combat hero of the Volunteer Air Force, who continuously shot down five American Sabre jet fighters in five air battles in less than twenty days with flexible tactics and courageous and decisive fighting spirit; Yi Caixue, a special-class merit winner and second-class hero, who blasted four enemy fire points in a certain battle in Shangganling in twenty minutes, single-handedly repelled four counterattacks by an enemy company, and killed and wounded more than 100 enemies with machine guns; Cai Jintong, a young scout, a first-class merit winner, and a second-class hero, who single-handedly covered the retreat of the entire company, fought back against the enemy while holding his abdomen after his left wrist was broken and his abdomen was injured and his intestines came out, and climbed back to the position over mountains and rivers; Li Dexue, a special-class merit winner, a Korean youth, who unloaded more than a dozen time bombs at the risk of his life seven times and created experience in unloading Fenglei bombs, ensuring smooth transportation; Zhang Ruichen, an artillery special-class merit winner, who used his bravery, tenacity, and skilled technology to annihilate 394 enemies with the firepower of one gun in a tense battle for four days and nights, as well as female young soldiers, model medical workers Ning Jizhi and Zhang Wanling, who participated in this conference.

When these outstanding sons and daughters of the motherland stood up from their seats and met with all the representatives, all the representatives regarded them as models of the glory and pride of the motherland and gave them warm cheers and thunderous applause.

In his speech to the conference, Li Yan, Deputy Chairman of the Central Committee of the Korean Democratic Youth League, paid warm tribute to the Chinese people and the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, for their great assistance to the Korean people's struggle against aggression. He also presented the conference with a pennant with a red background and gold border, decorated with the words "Long live the solid fighting friendship between the youth of China and Korea forged in blood in the long revolutionary struggle and the common struggle against American aggressors!" At this time, all the representatives in the audience stood up and cheered to pay tribute to the fighting Korean people. The afternoon session ended at six o'clock.
