    Qinghai Provincial People's Government Finance Department
    Fabricates Final Accounts to Illegally Obtain Funds
    In July 1952, the Qinghai Provincial People's Government Finance Department, when preparing the province's 1951 financial revenue and expenditure final accounts, fabricated 4.3 billion yuan of expenditure from 1952 as expenditure from 1951, and reported it in the 1951 final accounts to reimburse it, so that this amount could be used as an extra-budgetary expenditure for 1952. When the department prepared the 1951 final accounts on behalf of the Yushu Special District, it did not follow the final account materials reported by the special district, but used the special expenditures of the Yushu Special District as an excuse to deliberately over-report the 1951 final accounts by 11.5 billion yuan; and falsely listed items under the headings of "Administration" and "Party and League Expenses" to obtain reimbursement. However, when allocating funds to the Yushu Special District, it reduced the allocation on the grounds that the special district had income, which made various expenditures of the Yushu Special District difficult, forming a situation of self-sufficiency. When the Financial Administration Bureau of the Northwest Administrative Committee and the Provincial Supervisory Committee sent personnel to inspect, the relevant cadres of the Qinghai Provincial Finance Department also adopted a dishonest attitude, deliberately concealing the final account materials submitted by the Yushu Special District, and saying that the Yushu Special District had not submitted any materials. It was only after more than ten investigations that the materials were produced.
    The Qinghai Provincial People's Government Finance Department's behavior of making false reports and illegally obtaining funds is a serious violation of financial discipline, and the department should conduct a profound self-criticism. It is hoped that the Central Ministry of Finance and the Northwest Administrative Committee will seriously handle this matter.

    青海省人民政府财政厅
    假造决算冒领款项
    青海省人民政府财政厅于一九五二年七月间，编造该省一九五一年财政收支决算时，把一九五二年的开支四十三亿元伪造为一九五一年的开支，在一九五一年的决算中作了报销，以便使这笔款作一九五二年计划外的开支。该厅代玉树专区编造一九五一年的决算时，不按该专区报告的决算材料办事，而以玉树专区的特殊开支为藉口，故意将一九五一年的决算多报一百一十五亿元；并以“行政”及“党团开支”科目冒列虚顶作报销。但在给玉树专区拨款时，则又以该专区有收入而少拨款，使得玉树专区各项开支遭到困难，形成自收自用。在西北行政委员会财政管理局和该省监察委员会派员检查时，青海省财政厅有关干部还采取不老实的态度，把玉树专区报送的决算材料故意加以隐瞒，并说玉树专区未送任何材料，经过十余次追查，才拿出材料来。
    青海省人民政府财政厅这种虚报冒领的行为，是严重违犯财政纪律的，该厅应作深刻检讨。并希中央财政部、西北行政委员会对这一事件进行严肃处理。
