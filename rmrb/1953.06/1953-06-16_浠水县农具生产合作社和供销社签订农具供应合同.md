    Xishui County Agricultural Tool Production Cooperative and Supply and Marketing Cooperative Sign Agricultural Tool Supply Contract
    In Xishui County, Hubei Province, many district-level agricultural tool production cooperatives, supply and marketing cooperatives, and agricultural production mutual aid teams have signed agricultural tool supply contracts. The signing of such contracts has effectively supported agricultural production on the one hand, and expanded the business of agricultural tool production cooperatives and supply and marketing cooperatives on the other. The Tuantuan District Iron Agricultural Tool Production Cooperative had previously experienced production difficulties due to poor sales. After signing the contract, they obtained more than 8 million yuan in transactions in one go. The Xima District Supply and Marketing Cooperative, which signed a contract with the agricultural tool production cooperative, can supply farmers with 394 large and small agricultural tools and 211 pieces of furniture in the first quarter.
    These contracts are signed based on the principle of mutual benefit and mutual assistance. The production cooperatives guarantee to improve product quality, and defective products can be exchanged. The supply and marketing cooperatives guarantee to send sales plans to the other party on time so that the other party's production can gradually become planned. The implementation of these contracts has enabled many agricultural tool production cooperatives in Xishui County to improve product quality and increase output. The business of supply and marketing cooperatives has also expanded. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

    浠水县农具生产合作社和供销社签订农具供应合同
    湖北省浠水县很多区的农具生产合作社、供销合作社和农业生产互助组签定了农具供应合同。这种合同的订立，一方面有效地支持了农业生产；一方面也扩大了农具生产合作社和供销合作社的营业。团坡区铁业农具生产合作社，过去曾因销路不好，生产发生困难。订立合同后，一次他们就获得八百多万元的买卖；而与该农具生产合作社订合同的洗马区供销合作社，第一季度就可供给农民大小农具三百九十四件，家具二百一十一件。
    这些合同是按互利互助的原则订立的，生产合作社方面保证提高产品质量，遇有坏产品可以调换；供销合作社方面保证按期作销货计划送给对方，使对方生产逐渐有计划。这些合同执行的结果，已使浠水县很多农具生产合作社提高了产品质量，增加了产量；供销合作社的营业也扩大了。（据新华社讯）
