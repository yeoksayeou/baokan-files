(Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 8th) The Korean Armistice Talks Korean-Chinese Delegation issued the following communiqué on the agreement on the repatriation of prisoners of war on June 8th:

At 2:00 PM on June 8th, our chief representative, General Nam Il, and the opposing chief representative, Lieutenant General Harrison, reached and formally signed an agreement on the repatriation of prisoners of war in Panmunjom. The prisoner of war repatriation issue, which has been the only obstacle to the Korean armistice for more than a year, has now been resolved. Both sides agreed to appropriately amend Article 51 of the draft armistice agreement regarding the handling of directly repatriated prisoners of war, and to hand over the remaining prisoners of war who are not directly repatriated to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission for handling in accordance with the provisions of the "Terms of Reference of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission."

The full text of the "Terms of Reference of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission" signed by both parties on June 8th is as follows:

Terms of Reference of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission

(1) To ensure that all prisoners of war have the opportunity to exercise their right to be repatriated after the armistice, both parties invite Poland, Czechoslovakia, Sweden, Switzerland, and India to each appoint one member to form the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission to accommodate in Korea those prisoners of war under the custody of each detaining side who have not exercised their right to be repatriated. The Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission shall establish its headquarters in the demilitarized zone near Panmunjom and shall dispatch subsidiary bodies, identical in composition to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, to each location where the Repatriation Commission is responsible for guarding prisoners of war. Representatives of both parties shall be permitted to observe the work of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and its subsidiary bodies, including explanation and visits.

The weapons of all personnel stipulated in this paragraph shall be limited to light weapons of the military police type.

(3) With respect to the prisoners of war referred to in paragraph 1 above, force shall not be used, or threatened with force, to obstruct or compel their repatriation, and no violence shall be inflicted upon the person of prisoners of war in any manner or for any purpose (but subject to paragraph 7 below), or their dignity or self-esteem insulted. This task shall be entrusted to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission. The Commission shall ensure at all times that prisoners of war are treated humanely in accordance with the specific provisions of the Geneva Convention and the general spirit of that Convention.

Article 2 Custody of Prisoners of War

    【新华社开城八日电】朝鲜停战谈判朝中代表团六月八日发表关于战俘遣返问题的协议公报如下：
    六月八日下午二时我方首席代表南日大将与对方首席代表哈利逊中将在板门店达成并正式签订了关于遣返战俘的协议，一年多来唯一阻碍朝鲜停战的战俘遣返问题至此已获得解决。双方同意将停战协定草案第五十一款关于处理直接遣返的战俘的规定作适当的修改，而将未予直接遣返的其余战俘统交中立国遣返委员会，根据“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”的规定处理。
    六月八日双方签订的“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”的协议全文如下：中立国遣返委员会的职权范围
    第一条  通则
    （一）为保证全部战俘在停战之后有机会行使其被遣返的权利，双方邀请波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、瑞典、瑞士与印度各指派委员一名，以成立中立国遣返委员会，在朝鲜收容那些在各拘留方收容下未行使其被遣返的权利之战俘。中立国遣返委员会应设总部于非军事区内板门店附近，并应将与中立国遣返委员会在组成上相同的附属机构派驻于该遣返委员会负责看管战俘的各地点。双方的代表应被允许观察中立国遣返委员会及其附属机构之工作包括解释和访问。
    （二）为协助中立国遣返委员会执行其职务和责任所需的足够的武装力量与任何其他工作人员应专由印度提供，并依照日内瓦公约一三二条的规定，以印度代表为公断人，印度代表并应为中立国遣返委员会的主席和执行人。其他四国每一国的代表应准许其有同等数目，但每国不超过五十（50）人的参谋助理人员。各中立国代表因故缺席时，应由该代表指定其同国籍人为候补代表代行其职权。本款所规定的一切人员的武器，应限于军事警察类型的轻武器。
    （三）对上述第一款中所指之战俘，不得使用武力或以武力威胁以阻挠或强使其遣返，不得允许以任何方式或为任何目的（但须参照下述第七款）对战俘人身施以暴力或侮辱其尊严或自尊。这一任务应交托于中立国遣返委员会。该委员会并保证在任何时候均应按日内瓦公约的具体规定及该公约之总精神予战俘以人道的待遇。
    第二条  战俘之看管
    （四）一切于停战协定生效日后未行使其被遣返的权利之战俘，应尽速可行地，而在任何情况下应在停战协定生效日期后六十天内，从拘留一方的军事控制与收容下释放出来，在朝鲜境内由拘留一方指定之地点交给中立国遣返委员会。
    （五）当中立国遣返委员会在战俘居留之处负责管辖时，拘留一方的武装部队应撤离该处，以使前款所述之地点完全由印度的武装力量接管。
    （六）虽然有上述第五款的规定，拘留一方有责任维持和保证战俘看管地点周围区域的治安和秩序，并防止和控制拘留一方管辖地区的任何武装力量（包括非正规的武装力量）对战俘看管地点的任何扰乱和侵犯的行动。
    （七）虽然有上述第三款的规定，本协定中没有任何项目应被解释为削弱中立国遣返委员会行使其合法职务和责任以控制在其临时管辖下之战俘的权力。
    第三条  解释
    （八）中立国遣返委员会在接管全部未行使其被遣返权利的战俘之后，应立即进行安排，使战俘所属国家有自由与便利在自中立国遣返委员会接管之日起的九十天内，按照下列规定，派出代表前往此项战俘被看管的地点，向一切依附于该所属国家的战俘解释他们的权利，并通知他们任何有关他们回返家乡的事项，特别是他们有回家过和平生活的完全自由：

    （九）按照中立国遣返委员会为此目的而作的安排，在其看管下的战俘应有自由与便利向中立国遣返委员会和中立国遣返委员会的代表及其附属机构陈述和通讯，并通知他们关于战俘自己的任何事情的愿望。
    第四条  战俘的处理
    （十）在中立国遣返委员会的看管下，任何一个战俘如决定行使遣返权利，应向一个由中立国遣返委员会每一成员国一名代表所组成的机构提出申请，要求遣返。此项申请一经提出，中立国遣返委员会或其附属机构之一应立即加以考虑以便立即经由多数表决决定此项申请之有效。此项申请一经提出并由中立国遣返委员会或其附属机构之一使之生效，该战俘应即被送至准备被遣返之战俘的帐篷居留，然后该战俘应仍在中立国遣返委员会的看管下随即被送到板门店战俘交换地点，依停战协定规定的程序遣返。
    （十一）战俘的看管移交中立国遣返委员会九十天期满后，上述第八款中所规定的代表们对战俘的接触应即终止，而未行使被遣返的权利之战俘的处理问题，应交由停战协定草案第六十款中所建议召开的政治会议在三十天内设法解决。在这期间，中立国遣返委员会应继续保持对这些战俘的看管。任何战俘凡在中立国遣返委员会负责看管他们后的一百二十天内，尚未行使其被遣返权利，又未经政治会议为他们协议出任何其他处理办法者，应由中立国遣返委员会宣布解除他们的战俘身份，使之成为平民；然后根据各人的申请，其中凡有选择前往中立国者，应由中立国遣返委员会和印度红十字会予以协助。这一工作应在三十天内完成，完成后，中立国遣返委员会即停止职务并宣告解散。在中立国遣返委员会解散以后，无论在任何时候和任何地方，凡有希望回到他们的祖国的上述已被解除战俘身份的平民，应由其所在地区当局负责协助他们回返祖国。
