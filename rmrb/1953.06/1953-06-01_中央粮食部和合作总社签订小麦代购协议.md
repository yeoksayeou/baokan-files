    The summer harvest season has arrived, and farmers in most wheat-producing areas of our country will soon begin harvesting. It is estimated that within ten days or half a month, a large amount of new wheat will be on the market. In order to promptly carry out the purchase work, the Central People's Government Ministry of Food and the All-China Federation of Cooperatives recently signed the 1953 Wheat Purchase Agreement.
    According to this agreement, the state will entrust the cooperative to purchase most of the wheat this year. The focus of the purchases by cooperatives at all levels is in primary markets such as counties and towns. The Central Ministry of Food will control the purchase work in large and medium-sized cities and grain distribution markets where institutions were originally established. In the purchase of grain, the policy of grading and pricing and premium prices for superior grades will continue to be implemented as last year. Therefore, the state grain department will stipulate grain samples and standards for moisture and impurities. Before and during the purchase, the cooperative will publicize premium prices for superior grades to farmers based on grading specifications and prices, and educate farmers to dry and clean their crops for sale.
    In order to strengthen the grain purchase work, the agreement also stipulates that joint offices should be organized by the provincial and county-level institutions of both parties in the main wheat-producing areas to effectively grasp the wheat purchase work, and cadres should be frequently dispatched to organize joint inspection teams to go deep into the grassroots purchase points to supervise and inspect, in order to solve the main problems in the purchase.

    中央粮食部和合作总社签订小麦代购协议
    【新华社讯】夏收季节已到，我国大部产麦区的农民即将先后开镰收割。估计再有十天或半月将有大批新麦上市。国家为了及时进行收购工作，中央人民政府粮食部和中华全国合作社联合总社最近签订了一九五三年小麦代购协议。
    根据这个协议，今年国家大部分收购小麦工作将委托合作社代购。各级合作社收购的重点在县、镇等初级市场。中央粮食部将掌握大、中城市和原来设有机构的粮食集散市场的收购工作。在收购粮食中，仍将像去年一样，贯彻分等论价、优级优价政策，因此，国家粮食部门将规定粮食样品和水分与杂质标准，合作社在收购前及收购中根据评级规格和价格，向农民宣传优级优价，并教育农民晒干扬净出售。
    为了加强粮食收购工作，协议并规定：在主要产麦区双方省、县两级机构应组织联合办公室，切实掌握购麦工作，并经常抽派干部组织联合检查小组，深入基层收购点督促检查，以求解决收购中的主要问题。
