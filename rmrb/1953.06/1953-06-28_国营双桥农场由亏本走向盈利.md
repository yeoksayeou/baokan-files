    State-run Shuangqiao Farm Turns from Loss to Profit
    By our reporter Zhu Xueke
    The Shuangqiao Farm, directly under the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government, was established in 1949. All the original cultivated land of the farm was fertile; the breed of dairy cows raised was also relatively good. Since the implementation of mechanized farming in 1950, production has recovered and developed rapidly. However, by the fiscal year 1952, the farm had lost 92 million yuan.
    Why the loss?
    They did not proceed from the actual needs of the farm's production, but used a large amount of state funds for blind and extravagant construction. By the end of last year, the state's investment in the farm totaled more than 9.3 billion yuan, of which more than 8.2 billion yuan was used for construction. They not only did not invest state funds in the most critical links for developing production, but also increased the burden of indirect costs and expenses (depreciation), hindering capital accumulation and expanded reproduction. According to accounting, the depreciation cost of construction in the first three years (1950 to 1952) totaled 600 million yuan, and this year alone it will increase to 500 million yuan, accounting for about 20 percent of the farm's total annual production cost. Among the construction costs, the expenditure on construction is even more prominent. This cost accounts for 59.8 percent of the total construction cost. From April to December last year, the farm engaged in large-scale construction, successively building 12 houses, including pigsties and incubation rooms, totaling 2,372 square meters, costing more than 2.5 billion yuan. In these houses, the construction cost per square meter mostly exceeded one million yuan. The four newly built pigsties cost 860 million yuan, while the annual income from selling fattened pigs and piglets was only 107 million yuan. A "vernalization room" built at a cost of 370 million yuan has been used as an office. Some visitors, after seeing these buildings that are extremely disproportionate to production, called the pigsties and chicken coops "pig mansions" and "chicken mansions."
    The farm's agricultural and animal husbandry production was carried out under the condition of disregarding costs and blindly pursuing high output. They only cared about completing "production tasks" and disregarded the actual interests of the people. In agricultural production, they excessively increased fertilizer investment and labor; in animal husbandry production, they fed too much fine feed. As a result, even if the output was truly increased, it was still a loss. With this erroneous idea of "exchanging money for increased production" in disguise, they did not seriously study and improve cultivation and feeding management techniques, and waste and losses were even greater.
    Last year, the farm planted 826 mu of cotton. In order to complete the unrealistic production increase task he proposed (450 jin of seed cotton per mu in large fields and 1,000 jin per mu in high-yield fields), the farm manager applied 280 million yuan worth of fertilizer (of which commercial fertilizer accounted for more than 96 percent), using more than 17,000 man-days. The cost per mu of cotton field increased to 1.1 million yuan. As a result, due to excessive application of nitrogen fertilizer, the maturation period of cotton was prolonged, and coupled with the failure to pay attention to prevention work, it suffered from frost damage. The average yield per mu was only more than 259 jin of seed cotton, and the high-yield fields only yielded 524 jin. According to accounting, the cost per jin of seed cotton was 4,582 yuan, while the market price was only 2,800 yuan. This single item of production lost more than 240 million yuan.
    Chicken raising was considered a production in which the farm smoothly "completed the plan." Last year, the more than 1,200 chickens raised produced more than 100,900 eggs throughout the year. Among them, the average annual egg production of Leghorn chickens increased from 185 in 1951 to 188. However, due to the high price of feed (the first half of the year was fed with 10 kinds of feed such as wheat, corn, sorghum, barley, dried fish, bean cake, bran, and clam powder; the second half of the year increased to 14 kinds), the expenditure was too large, and the total feed cost accounted for 80 percent of the total cost. This made the annual chicken raising production lose more than 60 million yuan.
    The farm's leading cadres did not seriously adopt the economic accounting methods of socialist enterprises to manage agricultural enterprises of a socialist nature, did not educate the workers to be masters of their own affairs and to be thrifty, lacked sound systems, and even lacked quota management. As a result, waste occurred to varying degrees in all links, whether in purchasing materials, selling products, or storage. Seven thousand jin of sugar radishes and other dairy cow feed were frozen due to no one being responsible. Eight thousand jin of wheat bran and three thousand jin of lint cotton could not be found. When the market price of each egg was 800 yuan, the farm's salesman sold eggs for only 400 yuan each; when the grain company sold miscellaneous grain feed for only 400 yuan per jin, the farm bought it from the market for 800 yuan per jin. The damage rate of agricultural tools was also very high. These examples of waste and loss are too numerous to mention, and the amount of waste and loss is difficult to count.
    Throughout the year's production process, the farm's leading cadres not only turned a blind eye to the above-mentioned serious waste and damage to state property, but also adopted a bureaucratic attitude towards the opinions constantly put forward by activists among the workers, damaging the enthusiasm of the activists. The general workers, because their political awareness was not improved and the sense of being masters was not established, generally held a "work slowly" attitude and did not cherish the farm's wealth as if it were their own family business.

               ×　×　×

    Shuangqiao Farm launched an anti-bureaucracy struggle in February. This is the key to transforming the farm's management. In this struggle, in addition to the above opinions, the workers successively put forward more than 300 written opinions, comprehensively exposing the waste phenomena that occurred in the farm, and criticizing the leading cadres' supply system remnants of thought with no cost concept and bureaucratic style. The leading cadres deeply realized the serious harm that the supply system thinking caused to the farm's production from the facts exposed by the farm's workers. The five cadres above the production team leader who were criticized all made self-criticisms in public. Each person criticized and excavated the roots of small peasant thinking and supply system thinking from their own different specific situations, and put forward the direction of future efforts. The workers also received practical education in this struggle, truly realized that they were the masters of the farm, and their production enthusiasm was unprecedentedly high. This struggle not only cleansed the remnants of the supply system thinking retained in the minds of the farm's workers, laying a solid ideological foundation for the implementation of economic accounting; but also became a huge driving force for improving the farm's management in the future.
    From March to May, the farm's leading cadres accepted the lessons of the past, and after in-depth investigation and research and repeated mobilization of workers to discuss, re-formulated the 1953 production and financial plan, proposed the struggle target of making a profit of 1 billion yuan for the whole year, initially standardized various quotas, and adjusted the labor organization, creating conditions for the implementation of economic accounting. All the farm's workers carefully calculated with the attitude of being masters, so this plan was both practical and advanced.
    First of all, after investigation and research by the leading cadres and discussion by all the farm's workers, based on the farm's existing equipment, development prospects, and other conditions, the management policy of focusing on animal husbandry production such as raising dairy cows, combined with the development of agricultural and forestry production, was determined, overcoming the blindness and dispersion in past management. Around this general policy, in addition to sowing 819 mu of agricultural crops such as cotton and wheat, agricultural production this year expanded the sowing area of feed by more than 3,600 mu, ensuring that the various feeds produced throughout the year can fully supply the needs of dairy cows, and preparing for the official implementation of the eight-year rotation of pasture next year. In terms of machinery, after strengthening the operation plan, the potential of the machinery was fully utilized. Without adding power, the cultivation area this year can be more than doubled compared with last year. In terms of basic construction, based on this policy, the money was concentrated on supplementary equipment that would play a role in expanding production this year. This will increase the total output value of the farm's various productions to more than 3.6 billion yuan this year, an increase of about 30 percent compared with last year.
    Secondly, because all the farm's workers have a comprehensive understanding of the significance of the farm's production and have established a cost concept, everyone unanimously actively seeks tricks and thinks of ways to minimize costs on the premise of ensuring the completion of planned tasks. In terms of various expenses, there were no consumption quotas in the past; after democratic discussion, according to the actual situation, they were all initially standardized. Personnel also fixed their positions. Therefore, although production has expanded this year, the expenditure on costs and expenses is estimated to be only more than 2.5 billion yuan, a decrease of more than 12 percent compared with last year's expenditure.
    In the process of formulating this plan, the agricultural production team used cost budgeting as a mirror and came up with various ways to reduce costs in order to achieve the requirement of making a profit in everything. The farm's workers and more than 1,000 teachers and students of the Mechanized Agricultural College living together are a huge and valuable source of fertilizer, and there is also a lot of livestock manure on the farm. However, in the past, they mainly applied commercial fertilizers such as soybean cake and ammonium sulfate. Now, they have decided to strengthen manure accumulation and mainly apply manure and farmyard manure, greatly saving fertilizer investment. When calculating labor, after repeated discussions by the workers, detailed accounts were calculated, and on-the-spot experiments were carried out, the different number of workdays required for each mu of different crops was determined. According to this calculation, the total number of workdays required for agricultural production throughout the year is only 21,000, which is almost the same as the number of workdays when the cultivated area did not expand last year.
    Livestock technician Han Zhijiang studied with the workers, took the Soviet Union's livestock feed unit standardization as a reference, investigated the prices of various feeds in the local market, and studied their nutritional value. On the premise of ensuring that the Soviet feed unit has the same nutritional value, he came up with the method of replacing soybean cake with black beans and replacing part of corn and sorghum with sweet potatoes, and standardized the various feed units for pig raising on the farm. From the 700,000 jin of feed required for pig raising throughout the year, 70 million yuan will be saved compared with last year.
    The reasonable adjustment of labor organization was carried out simultaneously with the formulation of the plan. According to the actual needs of Shuangqiao Farm's production and various quotas, in order to strengthen management, the farm manager's office, accounting group, and two production teams for animal husbandry and agriculture (including mechanized farming in the agricultural production team) were established. The number of management personnel was reduced from 32 last year to 24. Although the number of cattle increased from 126 to 171 this year, the number of pigs increased from more than 240 to more than 400, and the number of chickens increased from more than 1,200 to more than 12,200, the animal husbandry production team was reduced from 35 to 33. They also changed the past erroneous practice of having workers act as supervisors and relying on hiring short-term workers to complete production tasks; and determined to take the production team as the production unit and uniformly allocate labor. This approach has already had good results; according to the sequence of work arranged throughout the year, the agricultural production team tightly grasped the labor situation of each group during the spring plowing and sowing this year, and timely transferred labor from the other four groups to help the horticulture group plant 20 mu of cabbage, saving more than 200 man-days. In the past, it was impossible to do this because the labor force could not be uniformly allocated on a group basis.
    In May, the farm's production and financial plan was finalized and approved by the higher authorities. In order to strengthen plan management and ensure the implementation of the plan, the farm's leadership mobilized all the farm's workers to discuss it, and established various systems, and signed contact contracts between the accounting office and the two production teams for animal husbandry and agriculture, as well as between the two production teams. They handed over the plan to each team, each group, and each worker, mobilized them to consciously implement their own production and financial plan, and everyone acted as their own statistician and accountant, and implemented their own economic accounting. In this way, the initiative and enthusiasm of each worker were further exerted, and the workers constantly created various ways to increase production and save in production, and continued to promote the spirit of criticism and self-criticism. Wang Guilin, the 50-year-old leader of the dairy cow group of the animal husbandry production team, has become unprecedentedly active. The 12 dairy cows he raised in his group have already overfulfilled the milk production task by 5,000 kilograms in the first five months (the original plan was to produce 38,034 kilograms of milk in five months). Now he is using his brains again, according to his 30 years of experience in raising dairy cows, and has put forward specific methods to improve feeding management, and continues to work hard to overfulfill the annual milk production plan of 96,384 kilograms.
    Shuangqiao Farm is moving from the road of losing money in production to the road of making a profit. In the past five months, the production of raising dairy cows, which accounts for more than 60 percent of the farm's production, has already overfulfilled the planned output for five months (the original planned output was 147,380 kilograms, and the actual milk production has reached 154,266 kilograms). They are now absorbing Wang Guilin's feeding management experience and striving to overfulfill the annual milk production plan. In terms of agricultural production, after successfully completing the spring plowing and sowing tasks, they are now carrying out the summer harvest and summer hoeing in full swing.
    The farm is now also brewing a patriotic production increase and saving competition campaign, trying its best to obtain more excess profits and accumulate more experience in managing modern agriculture.

    国营双桥农场由亏本走向盈利
    本报记者　朱学科
    中央人民政府农业部直属双桥农场是一九四九年建立的。全场原有的耕田都是熟田；所饲养的乳牛的品种也比较好。自一九五○年实行机耕后，生产的恢复和发展都比较迅速。但到了一九五二年度，全场却亏本九千二百万元。
    为什么会亏本呢？
    他们不从本场生产的实际需要出发，把国家的大量资金用于盲目的铺张的建设。截至去年年底，国家在该场的投资共达九十三亿多元，用于建设的即达八十二亿多元。他们不仅没有把国家的资金投在发展生产最紧要的环节上，而且增加了间接成本费用（折旧费）的负担，妨碍着资金的积累和扩大再生产。据核算，在前三年中（一九五○年到一九五二年）建设的折旧费共为六亿元，今年一年即将增达五亿元，约占全场全年生产成本总额的百分之二十。在建设费用中，建筑费用的开支更为突出。这笔费用共占建设费用总额的百分之五十九点八。去年从四月到十二月，全场大兴土木，先后共建筑了猪舍、孵化室等房屋十二座，计二千三百七十二平方公尺，共化了二十五亿多元。在这些房屋中，每平方公尺的建筑费用，绝大部分都超过一百万元。四座新建的猪舍，共化了八亿六千万元，而全年出卖的肥猪和子猪收入，仅有一亿零七百万元。花了三亿七千万元新建的一座“春化室”，一直是做着办公室。有些参观的人看了这些与生产极不相称的建筑，就称猪舍、鸡舍为“猪公馆”、“鸡公馆”。
    全场的农、畜业各项生产，都是在不计成本、盲目追求高额产量的状况下进行的。他们只顾完成“增产任务”，不顾损害人民的实际利益。在农业生产上，过多地增加肥料投资和人工；在畜牧生产上，多喂精质饲料。这样做的结果，即使产量真正提高了，也还是亏了本。有了这种变相的“以钱换增产”的错误思想，他们就不认真钻研和提高耕作及饲养管理技术，浪费和损失就更大了。
    去年，全场种了八百二十六亩棉花，场长为了要完成他所提出的不切实际的增产任务（大田每亩要收籽花四百五十斤，丰产田每亩收一千斤），就下了价值二亿八千万元的肥料（其中商品肥料占百分之九十六以上），共用了一万七千多个人工。每亩棉田成本提高到一百一十万元。结果，由于氮肥施的过多，延长了棉花的成熟期，加以未注意预防工作，遭受了霜害，每亩平均只收籽花二百五十九斤多，丰产田也只收了五百二十四斤。核算的结果，每斤籽花的成本费花了四千五百八十二元，而市价只有二千八百元。单这一项生产，就亏本了二亿四千多万元。
    养鸡算是全场顺利“完成计划”的一项生产，去年饲养的一千二百多只鸡，全年产蛋十万零九千多个。其中来克亨鸡每只平均年产蛋从一九五一年的
    一百八十五个，增加到一百八十八个。但由于饲料价格高（上半年喂的是小麦、玉米、高粱、大麦、鱼干、豆饼、麸子、蜊粉等十种饲料；下半年增加达十四种），开支过大，全部饲料费用占到总成本费用的百分之八十。这就使全年的养鸡生产，亏本了六千多万元。
    场的领导干部不是认真地采用社会主义企业的经济核算的方法，来管理社会主义性质的农业企业，对职工也没有进行当家做主和精打细算的教育，没有健全的制度，更缺乏定额管理。这样，不论在购置物料、推销产品或是保管等各个环节，都产生了程度不同的浪费现象。有七千斤糖萝卜等乳牛饲料，因为无人负责冻坏了。有八千斤麦麸、三千斤皮棉找不到下落。当市场每个鸡蛋售价为八百元的时候，该场供销员卖出的鸡蛋，每个只有四百元；粮食公司的杂粮饲料每斤只卖四百元时，而该场在市场买来的是每斤八百元。农具的损坏率也很高。这些浪费和损失的事例举不胜举，其浪费和损失数量也难以统计。
    场的领导干部在全年的生产过程中，不但对以上严重的浪费和损害国家财富的情况熟视无睹，而且对职工中积极分子所不断提出的意见，也是采取官僚主义的态度，损害了积极分子的情绪。一般的职工因为政治认识得不到提高，主人翁的思想没有树立，普遍地抱着“磨洋工”的态度，不是像对待自己的家业那样来爱护农场的财富。
               ×　×　×
    双桥农场二月份展开了反官僚主义斗争。这是转变该场经营管理的关键。在这个斗争中，职工们除去上面那些意见以外，先后并提出了书面意见三百多件，全面地揭发了场里所发生的浪费现象，批评了领导干部的毫无成本观念的供给制残余思想和官僚主义作风。领导干部从全场职工揭发的事实中，深刻地认识到供给制思想给予农场生产事业的严重危害。被批评的五个生产队长以上的干部，都当众进行了检讨，每个人都从自己的不同具体情况，批判和挖掘小农思想和供给制思想的根源，提出以后努力的方向。职工们在这次斗争中也受到了实际的教育，真正体会到自己是农场的主人，生产情绪空前高涨。这次斗争不但使全场职工头脑里所保留的供给制残余思想得到了一次清洗，为实行经济核算打下了坚实的思想基础；而且成为以后改进农场经营管理的巨大动力。
    从三月到五月，场的领导干部接受了过去的教训，在经过深入的调查研究和反复的发动职工讨论以后，重新制订了一九五三年度的生产财务计划，提出全年生产赢利十亿元的奋斗指标，初步标定了各种定额，并调整了劳动组织，为实行经济核算创造了条件。全场职工都以主人翁态度来精打细算，因此这次计划订得既切实又先进。
    首先，经过领导干部的调查研究和全场职工的讨论，从本场现有设备、发展前途等条件出发，确定了以饲养乳牛等畜牧生产为主，结合发展农、林业生产的经营方针，克服了过去经营上的盲目性、分散性。农业生产围绕这个总方针，今年除播种棉、麦等农作物八百十九亩外，并扩大饲料播种面积三千六百多亩，保证全年生产的各种饲料可以充分供给乳牛的需要，并为明年正式实行牧草八年轮作制作好准备。在机务方面，加强了作业计划以后，充分地发挥了机具的潜力，在不添置动力的情况下，今年耕作面积可以比去年扩大一倍多。在基本建设方面，依据这个方针，把钱集中用到对今年扩大生产起作用的补充设备上。这就使今年全场各项生产总值可增加到三十六亿多元，比去年提高约百分之三十。
    其次，由于全场职工对于农场生产的意义有了全面的认识，确立了成本观念，大家都一致地在保证完成计划任务的前提下，积极地找窍门、想办法，尽量压低成本。在各项费用上，过去没有规定过消费定额；经过民主讨论以后，根据实际情况，都初步地进行了标定。人员也固定了职务。因此，今年的生产虽是扩大了，而成本费用的开支预计仅达二十五亿多元，比去年的开支还要降低百分之十二以上。
    农业生产队在这次制订计划的过程中，以成本预算作为镜子，想出各种办法来降低成本，以达到样样生产赢利的要求。该场职工和住在一起的机械化农业学院师生共一千多人，粪便是一个巨大而宝贵的肥料来源，场内的牲畜粪便也不少。可是，过去他们却以施用豆饼、硫铵等商品肥料为主。现在，他们决定加强积肥工作，以施用粪肥厩肥为主，大量节约了肥料的投资。在计算用工时，经过职工们的反复讨论，算细账，并作了实地实验，确定了各种不同作物每亩地所需的不同工数。这样一算，全年农业生产的用工总数只需二万一千个，和去年耕地面积没扩大时的用工数差不多。
    养猪技术员韩之江与工人一道研究，以苏联的养猪饲料单位标定作参考，调查了当地市场各种饲料的价格，研究了它们的营养价值。在保证与苏联饲料单位具有同样营养价值的前提下，想出了以黑豆代替豆饼、以白薯代替部分玉米、高粱的办法，标定出本场养猪的各种饲料单位。从全年养猪所需用的七十万斤饲料中，比去年要节约七千万元。
    合理地调整劳动力组织，是和制订计划同时进行的。根据双桥农场生产的实际需要和各种定额，为了加强经营管理，建立了场长办公室、会计组，和畜牧、农业两个生产队（机耕包括在农业生产队中）。管理人员由去年的三十二人，缩减为二十四人。今年牛虽由一百二十六头增达一百七十一头，猪由二百四十多只增达四百多只，鸡由一千二百多只增达一万二千二百多只，畜牧生产队却由原来的三十五人减为三十三人。他们并改变了过去由工人做监工，依靠请短工来完成生产任务的错误做法；确定以生产队为生产单位，统一调配劳动力。这样做法已经有了很好的效果；农业生产队根据全年工作排列的顺序，在今年春耕播种中，紧紧掌握住各组的用工情况，及时地从其他四个小组抽调劳动力，去帮助园艺组种好二十亩洋白菜，共节省了二百多个人工。过去以小组为单位，不能统一调配人力，就做不到这一点。
    五月，全场生产财务计划最后定案，并经上级审核批准。场的领导方面为了加强计划管理，保证计划的贯彻，发动全场职工来讨论它，并建立了各项制度，订立了会计室与畜牧、农业两个生产队之间以及两生产队相互间的联系合同。他们把计划交给各队、各组和每个职工，发动他们自觉地执行自己的生产财务计划，每个人都做自己的统计员和会计员，执行自己的经济核算。这样，更发挥了每个职工的主动性、积极性，职工们在生产中不断地创造出各种增产节约的办法，并继续发扬批评与自我批评精神。畜牧生产队乳牛大组长、五十岁的王桂林空前地积极起来。他一组饲养的十二头乳牛，在前五个月中，已经超额五千公斤完成了牛奶生产任务（原计划五个月共产奶三万八千零三十四公斤）。现在他又在开动脑筋，根据他过去三十年饲养乳牛的经验，提出了改进饲养管理的具体办法，为超额完成全年产奶九万六千三百八十四公斤的计划而继续努力。
    双桥农场正从生产亏本的道路走向生产赢利的道路。在过去的五个月中，占全场生产比重达百分之六十以上的饲养乳牛生产，已经超额完成了五个月的计划产量（原计划产量为十四万七千三百八十公斤，实际产奶量已达十五万四千二百六十六公斤）。他们现在正在吸取王桂林的饲养管理经验，为超额完成全年产奶计划而努力。在农业生产方面，继胜利地完成春耕播种任务以后，又正在紧张地进行夏收夏锄。
    全场现在还正在酝酿开展爱国增产节约竞赛运动，尽量地争取获得更多的超额赢利，积累更多的经营近代化农业的经验。
