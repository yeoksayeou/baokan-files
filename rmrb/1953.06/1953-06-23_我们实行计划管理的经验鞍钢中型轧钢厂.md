Our Experience in Implementing Planned Management
    Anshan Iron and Steel Company's Medium-Sized Rolling Mill

    The Anshan Iron and Steel Company's Medium-Sized Rolling Mill began to strengthen its operational planning and establish a production instruction chart system in the fourth quarter of 1952. The results of the trial implementation quickly and fundamentally reversed the uneven phenomenon of production being lax at the beginning and tight at the end. In the twelve weeks of the first quarter of this year, except for the three weeks when the rolling variety sequence was changed and the main motor had an accident, the equilibrium rate was 100% for the remaining nine weeks. February's output exceeded the state plan by 20%, and March's exceeded it by 23.68%. The scrap rate in the first quarter decreased by 0.19% compared to the fourth quarter of last year, the qualified product rate increased by 1.25% compared to the fourth quarter, and the equipment utilization rate also increased by 1.1%. With operational plans, production can be carried out with preparation. Therefore, at the beginning of the month, it is possible to discover which raw materials or tools will be problematic for the entire month, and timely measures can be taken to avoid the handicraft management method of treating the head when it hurts and the foot when it aches. At the same time, due to the establishment of production instruction charts for shifts, workers know every hour whether they have completed their tasks, which greatly promotes their enthusiasm for labor.

    Operational planning is the specific plan for the production activities of workshops, sections, groups, and various processes. To achieve rhythmic production, operational plans must be well-executed. Currently, the medium-sized mill has three types of operational plans: monthly, weekly, and shift operational plans.

    The operational plan is based on the production tasks and ordered varieties stipulated by the state, as well as the factory's technical and economic conditions (including equipment maintenance, equipment capacity, and various quota requirements), raw material reserves and spare parts preparation, balance of transportation capacity, worker operating skills, and the task completion status of the previous month.

    When formulating an operational plan, the following conditions must first be considered to determine the rolling sequence of various steel grades:

    I. According to customer needs, each month we have to produce many different steel grades and specifications, up to thirty-four types at most. Some of these steels can be rolled on the same set of rolls, while others require changing the rolls. If the number of roll changes is high, the operating time will be relatively reduced. Therefore, the sequence of various products must be arranged reasonably to minimize the number of roll changes. In addition, the production procedures for various products are different. For example, rolling light rails requires straightening and processing, but the current straightening capacity for light rails is only two-thirds of the rolling capacity. If light rails are produced continuously, they will accumulate in the factory. Large square steel and round steel, on the other hand, do not need straightening. Therefore, in order to maintain the equilibrium of the entire production, the products that are most difficult to straighten and those that do not need straightening must be appropriately spaced out in advance to fully utilize equipment utilization.

    II. Coordinate with maintenance work. According to the current production conditions of the medium-sized mill, asphalt is often used when rolling light rails. Asphalt flows under the rolling mill and solidifies with the iron sheets, making it difficult to remove. Therefore, the roll changing time after rolling light rails usually takes sixteen to twenty-four hours (while changing rolls for other varieties only takes about six hours). Each work group can take advantage of this opportunity to carry out mechanical maintenance. In order to appropriately space out the maintenance cycle, if light rails have already been rolled in the first ten days of the month, the second time for rolling light rails should be scheduled in the middle or last ten days of the month.

    III. There are many specifications for angle steel, from the narrowest 50 mm to the widest 130 mm, totaling twenty types. It is best to produce the wider ones first, followed by the narrower ones. This way, the straightening rolls can be used multiple times, which is not only beneficial for economic accounting but also reduces the burden on the repair shop.

    IV. Products with readily available rolls and straightening rolls are scheduled for the first half of the month, giving the repair shop enough time to prepare production tools for the second half of the month.

    V. For products rolled at the beginning of the month, attention should be paid to whether the existing raw materials - steel billets - are sufficient. High-quality steel products that are more difficult to refine should be scheduled for the second half of the month as much as possible to avoid material shortage accidents.

    VI. In addition to the above, the urgency of orders must also be taken into consideration. If the state designates that some products are needed in the first ten days of the month, we cannot insist on scheduling them for the last ten days.

    Secondly, when formulating an operational plan, it is necessary to determine the shift output and formulate practical average advanced output quotas. To achieve this, it is necessary to constantly study and analyze the quotas. If outdated and impractical quotas are discovered, they must be transformed into new, compliant, and advanced indicators that can promote production and be incorporated into the operational plan, based on the actual situation and the development of objective conditions. For example, when rolling flat steel in October last year, the planned shift output (eight hours) was 1,100 pieces, with an hourly output of 145 pieces. During the rolling process, Comrade Li Shanglin of the Rolling Steel Class A invented a device with an iron dustpan, and the output immediately increased, eventually creating a record of 1,473 pieces per shift. We analyzed the hourly production records of this shift and calculated that the average advanced quota per hour was 211 pieces. Then, based on this analysis, we determined the quota for rolling this type of flat steel next time to be 200 pieces per hour. According to this quota, 1,500 pieces can be rolled per shift, exceeding the level reached by the new record.

    When determining the average advanced quota, attention should be paid to combining it with the actual situation. We do not use the average, nor the highest, and we do not base it on the so-called average advanced quota calculated solely from surface figures; instead, we analyze the reasons for high and low output based on the actual hourly output and operating conditions recorded for each rolling, and then set a practical average advanced quota. Such a quota will establish prestige among the masses, will be followed, will promote production, and will achieve equilibrium. However, the quota may sometimes be lowered due to various influences and limitations. For example, when rolling 110 mm square steel in March, the hourly output quota was 65 pieces. Because the steel billets were not heated well enough and the temperature was uneven, some scrap was produced. In April, on the advice of Soviet experts, the hourly output quota was changed to 60 pieces to ensure balanced hourly production and prevent roller breakage accidents. On the other hand, we actively tried to ensure that the steel billets could be fully heated, so that the previous quota could be restored when rolling next time.

    Again, after arranging the production sequence of various products and determining the quotas on which the plan is based, it is necessary to calculate and determine how much time is required to produce each product. For example, assuming that the output of 8 kg light rail is 150 tons per shift, if 1,500 tons are to be rolled, 10 shifts will be required. However, the roll changing time must also be added in. Because in addition to changing rolls when changing varieties, rolls must also be changed when the rolling groove is worn imprecisely (the former is called a major roll change, and the latter is called a minor roll change). The quality of each set of rolls is different, and the output varies greatly. Even on the same roll, the capacity of each rolling groove is not the same. Therefore, to determine the rolling time for each type of product, the capacity of the rolls must be investigated, and then the rolling capacity must be accurately estimated. Assume that rolling 1,500 tons of 8 kg light rail requires one shift for three minor roll changes and one shift for one major roll change, then 1,500 tons of light rail will require 12 shifts to complete (equal to four days). If the rolling time for each type of product in the entire month is added up and it is exactly the calendar time for the entire month or less than the calendar time, then it indicates that there is confidence in completing the varieties and output for the entire month. To ensure the completion of state tasks, the factory sometimes sets a higher plan. If it is affected by a little accident in the middle, even if it cannot complete the higher plan arranged by the factory, it can at least complete the state task.

    In addition, the steel grade, specifications, and quantity of steel billets to be used must also be determined in the operational plan, and a steel billet supply instruction chart must be prepared accordingly.

    The main role of the monthly operational plan is to determine the factory's highest goals, determine the start and end times for rolling each product and the maintenance time for the entire month, so that each section can refer to it and make production preparations in advance.

    The shortcomings of the monthly operational plan are that it does not specify the specific tasks for each day and each shift; it is sometimes very volatile and difficult to control.

    Therefore, weekly and shift operational plans must be used to supplement the deficiencies of the monthly operational plan.

    After having the operational plan, we began to implement rhythmic production organized according to instruction charts. Before the implementation, in the fourth quarter of last year, the leadership took a series of measures to address the serious imbalance in production, promptly overcoming weak links and laying a solid foundation for the implementation of the production instruction chart system.

    First, the operational plan was improved. First of all, practical average advanced quotas (including output quotas and consumption quotas) were formulated, and the consumption quotas for major raw materials were accurately calculated and further strictly controlled to ensure that the supply guarantees production, avoiding both work stoppages due to a lack of raw materials and stockpiles due to a lack of planning. Through the instruction charts, production needs were clarified, and reasonable reserve quantities were formulated in conjunction with advanced indicators, so that production could move forward steadily, and the supply department could also follow and cooperate in an orderly manner, avoiding being caught in a passive and chaotic state. This not only made reasonable use of raw materials but also accelerated the turnover of the enterprise's funds. At the same time, a dedicated person was designated to investigate mechanical equipment and efficiency. To prepare the operational plan reasonably, it is necessary to understand the mechanical capabilities of the main equipment. In the rolling mill, the quality and wear of various rolling rolls, straightening rolls, and other major production tools must be accurately estimated with reference to relevant data. Before the fourth quarter of last year, the management of rolling rolls and straightening rolls was very chaotic. Not only were the quality and wear records vague, but the quantity was also unclear. The leadership discovered these problems and promptly designated dedicated technicians to rectify them, classifying and stacking various rolling rolls and establishing a card system to register the ledgers. In the past, the straightening rolls in the straightening workshop were scattered all over the place. This time, a thorough inventory was also carried out, and those that could be used, those that could not be used at all, those that had been processed, and those that were yet to be processed were all registered separately. Only on this basis can a major production tool preparation instruction chart be prepared to grasp the timely supply of spare parts and achieve balanced production.

    Second, the dispatching organization was strengthened. The timely and accurate preparation of operational plans and instruction charts certainly created the preconditions for implementing planned production, but it did not mean that the operational plan could be smoothly implemented in production. It is necessary to check work on time, strengthen contact with all parties, and actively and promptly dispatch according to the problems that arise in production. This is the key to ensuring rhythmic production according to instruction charts.

    The medium-sized mill established a dispatching organization in 1950, with dispatching personnel on duty day and night in three shifts. However, the scope of responsibilities of the dispatchers was not very clear. Most of the time was spent sorting out basic-level records and preparing statistical reports. They were very busy every day, but they rarely contacted the site and lacked foresight. When problems occurred, they carried out responsive dispatching. As a result, problems were not resolved in a timely or correct manner, and the dispatchers' work morale was also affected. In addition, the dispatchers were frequently transferred, and dispatchers with a little experience were transferred to other positions. At the beginning of 1952, all three dispatchers were new, unfamiliar with the business, and helpless when encountering problems.

    In the fourth quarter of last year, the leadership decided to strengthen dispatching work. First, the scope of responsibilities and work rules for dispatching personnel were formulated, and some ineffective forms were abandoned. Telephones were installed in the main sections and groups to connect with the dispatching room, allowing dispatching personnel to check production status at any time and report to the leadership in a timely manner. In addition, a system was established to give dispatching personnel authority and responsibility, requiring the leadership and various departments to contact the site through the dispatching room for work related to production. In this way, the realization of balanced production was guaranteed.

    Third, technical management was strengthened. In the past, although we had some systems in this regard, they were not fully implemented. For example, records of the use of rolling grooves were sometimes interrupted, and technical operating procedures were often divorced from reality, so quality could not be guaranteed, and accidents were prone to occur. In particular, the machining work of rolling rolls, due to lax technical management, resulted in steel not being able to be rolled on the rolling mill. In the fourth quarter of last year, the leadership investigated the root causes of the above problems, appropriately assigned technical personnel, enabling them to be conscientious and responsible, and changed the old systems and old operating procedures that were not applicable into new systems and new operating procedures that were practical and could promote production.

    Fourth, cadres were assigned to go deep into the workshops to centralize leadership in production. Production instruction charts represent serious organization and discipline. They stipulate the work tasks of staff. For example, they stipulate that a certain shift must complete a certain quantity and quality of finished products within a certain period of time; that a certain shift must prepare certain tools at a certain time; that a certain shift must prepare certain raw materials at a certain time. Because it is necessary to closely coordinate all parties to maintain balanced production activities, highly centralized leadership must be implemented on the basis of democratic management. That is to say, the entire enterprise activity must be carried out under one will, so that it will not be self-serving, and it can avoid only being good for oneself without regard for others, or hindering others. When we did not implement the instruction chart system, no one was responsible for production at night. The main cadres were all on the day shift. Although there was a duty system, the duty personnel did not understand the situation, and when problems occurred, they could not be solved in a timely manner. Leading cadres were often awakened by phone calls in the dormitory, and they were always nervous for twenty-four hours a day. At the end of 1952, on-duty directors and on-duty section chiefs were set up to follow the shifts, and someone led and supervised the production of the three shifts, and could check and report in a timely manner. At the same time, the dispatching work was assigned to be directly led by the on-duty director, preparing extremely important prerequisites for the implementation of the instruction chart system.

    Fifth, original record work was rectified. Original records are the foundation of enterprise technical management and business management. The quality of original record work will directly affect the enterprise's economic accounting and plan preparation work.

    Over the past few years, original records and statistics have accumulated a lot of data for us. Based on these data, various quotas and instruction charts can be prepared; but in order to make them practical, it is necessary to further strengthen the original records. In the fourth quarter of last year, the leadership found that the organizational structure responsible for original records was unsound; the quality of work was uneven; personnel were not appropriately allocated; record forms were not uniform; the record personnel worked on a three-shift system and rarely participated in various activities and studies, so their political awareness and professional level were far behind the needs of practical work; and their positions were extremely unstable and had high turnover. All of these directly affected the reliability of the recorded figures, and of course caused incalculable losses to the preparation of statistical reports, the formulation of planned quotas, and the measurement and analysis of the enterprise's economic activities. In response to these shortcomings, the leadership rectified the organizational structure of the original records, allocated record personnel, unified and simplified forms, and organized professional learning, so that the work level of the record personnel was improved, and they recognized that the original records are the most basic, most practical, and considerably heavy important work positions in the entire enterprise. In this way, the enthusiasm of the record personnel was brought into play. Although our original records are not 100% accurate, most of the figures are close to reliable.

    In addition to the above, the post responsibility system and the shift handover contact system were also improved, democratic management was clarified, the organizational structure was reformed, and weak links were overcome in a timely manner, laying a favorable foundation for the implementation of the production instruction chart system.

    The implementation system of the production instruction chart is as follows:

    A. Before the 28th of each month, the Planning and Production Section shall, based on the production tasks formulated by the company's Planning Department and the ordering tasks of the company's Production Department, and in combination with the plant's production, tools, raw material preparation, and technical and economic conditions, make a summary of the production instruction master chart for the next month (monthly operational plan) and submit it to the factory director for review. The production instruction master chart summary approved by the factory director shall be distributed to each section and department through dispatching.

    B. The Planning and Production Section shall immediately draw the production instruction chart master chart and the production preparation work instruction chart (including raw material - steel billet supply instruction chart, rolling roll preparation instruction chart, straightening roll preparation instruction chart, guide plate preparation instruction chart, and preparation instruction charts for consumable materials such as coal, asphalt, and yellow oil) according to the master chart summary (monthly operational plan).

    Two to three copies of each chart are made, one hung in the factory director's office, one hung in the Planning and Production Section (including the dispatching room), and the other is given to the relevant departments for preparation work. After the charts are made, the dispatcher shall fill in the actual progress in the factory director's office by shift. The factory director shall convene a cadre meeting at the beginning of the month to study the various measures to be taken to complete the production instruction chart for that month, organize the division of labor, and designate the completion date. Then, the on-duty director shall convey and report the progress and relevant requirements indicated by the production instruction chart master chart to the general meetings of all three shifts. The dispatcher shall prepare the production instruction charts for the next shift one hour before the shift handover, based on the specific situation of the day and without deviating from the principles of the production instruction master chart, and shall have them reviewed by the chief of the Planning and Production Section and the on-duty director. Forty minutes before the start of the shift, the on-duty director shall convene a fifteen-minute meeting of the section and group leaders. At the meeting, the section and group leaders shall accept the production instruction charts and operating procedure execution instruction sheets issued by the on-duty director. The on-duty director shall also instruct the completion methods based on the opinions of all parties. After returning to the group, the group leader shall take fifteen minutes to announce to the workers and organize a discussion of the production instruction charts, allocate the specific work of each worker in the group, and then hand over the production instruction charts to the recorder to fill in on the instruction board near the workplace, and fill in the work situation on time during the execution. The system stipulates that each work group must strictly follow the instruction charts to ensure the equilibrium of the factory's production and must not delay or discount. If there is any delay, every effort should be made to catch up before the end of the shift.

    C. The tasks of each level for the production instruction chart are:

    The chief of the Production Section is the determiner and supervisor of the production instruction chart. The on-duty director is the direct promoter of the production instruction chart and issues the production instruction chart with enriched content to each work group for execution.

    The section chief is the leader and executor of the production instruction chart. The group leader is the executor of the production instruction chart. They are responsible for allocating the specific work of each worker in the group based on the production instruction chart and the instructions of the on-duty director. They can express opinions on the instruction chart, but they have no right to add or subtract the content of the chart before it is modified. The workers accept the arrangement of the group leader, and according to the post responsibility system and technical operating procedures, they are responsible for completing the specific tasks of the production instruction chart. The dispatcher is the compiler of the production instruction chart and the master of the specific situation that occurs during the execution. They are also responsible for assisting the on-duty director in handling disconnection phenomena in a timely manner, and making records and reflecting opinions to relevant parties.

    We have stipulated the following system for checking and reporting the execution of the production instruction chart:

    During the execution process, the deputy group leader is responsible for quality inspection, and the group leader shall report the production situation to the on-duty dispatcher. The dispatcher shall check the execution situation, and if anyone does not follow the instruction chart, the dispatcher shall promptly find out the reason and report it to the on-duty director and the chief of the Production Section. After the end of the shift, the group leader shall send the instruction chart with the actual progress filled in to the dispatching room, and report to the on-duty director on the completion of the instruction chart and the reasons for exceeding or not completing it. If it is not completed, the group leader shall make a review to the on-duty director; in addition, the group leader shall also report all problems that have occurred in the group and opinions on various departments. The on-duty director must investigate the responsibility of those who do not work according to the instruction chart and shall fill in the work diary by shift, detailing the reasons for the shift's exceeding or not completing the progress and the occurrence of accidental accidents. The problems existing in the work and the opinions or requirements of relevant departments and personnel shall also be filled in. In addition, they must report to the deputy factory director in charge of production in person. The dispatcher shall make an analytical report to the chief of the Production Section on the completion of the production instruction chart and the problems existing in the work and the problems that are expected to occur in the future. At each roll changing meeting, the chief of the Planning and Production Section shall report the completion of the instruction chart to the section and group leaders, and at the same time study and discuss how to complete the instruction chart, and submit the summary to the factory director.

    We have made the following provisions for the procedures for modifying the production instruction master chart: When changing the production instruction master chart, it must be approved by the factory director and the company's Production Department. When the on-duty director discovers new signs or difficulties in execution, the on-duty director must promptly study and modify opinions with the chief of the Planning and Production Section; if it is considered necessary to modify them, they must be modified by order through the factory director and the company's dispatching section; if it is considered unnecessary, specific methods must be pointed out. After the modification application is submitted, each section must execute according to the original production instruction chart before the instruction is modified.

    When the production of each shift does not match the instruction chart, the following treatment shall be made: If it does not exceed fifteen minutes of local inspection and changing of rolling grooves, saw blades, etc., the group leader must immediately report to the dispatcher. If work is forced to stop due to the interruption of supply from other sections or other factories, the group leader must immediately report to the on-duty director through dispatching and await instructions. If an accident occurs in each section that affects the work of other sections, the group leader must ask the on-duty director for instructions, and according to the specific situation, order a change in the shift production instruction chart of the relevant section through dispatching, but if it contradicts the master chart, the group leader must ask the factory director for instructions. Except for changing rolling grooves, hole doors, and saw blades, everything that violates the shift production instruction chart is called an accident. The section and group leaders must report the situation and handling opinions to the on-duty director or the factory director through dispatching within ten minutes of the occurrence of the accident; the on-duty director must personally go to the place where the accident occurred, inspect and investigate the cause, and deal with it, and then report to the factory director.

    This is roughly the situation of our factory's implementation of rhythmic production organized according to instruction charts. In the process of implementation, we have the following experiences:

    I. The basic purpose of the production instruction chart system is to achieve balanced production and simplify management. After implementing the instruction chart system, we can see the production situation of each link at every moment, and we will clearly find the weak links in production. Therefore, the process of production development (also can be said to be the process of execution of the production instruction chart) is also a continuous search for relative equilibrium, using the means of breaking through weak links, and leading the backward with the advanced to achieve relative equilibrium, and then breaking through the equilibrium, and then reaching a relative equilibrium in production. This is the balance problem of the entire production that must be paid attention to in managing production. If there are weak links, if there is a possibility of breakthrough, it must be broken through with the advanced as the standard to achieve balance in production; going further, the advanced should break through the balance again, and then go to overcome the weak links, and then achieve balance again. Of course, this cannot be based solely on pursuing quantity, but must be based on equipment capacity, product quality, and cost.

    II. Close contact with the masses is the key to doing a good job. The production instruction chart system is a management method that leads production with a unified will. Its foundation is relying on the labor discipline consciously observed by employees, so it must be in close contact with the masses; especially today when the planned management work cannot keep up with the needs of production development, and we have not yet explored a complete method, relying on the workers and masses is of greater significance.

    III. Instruction charts should be simple, clear, and easy for people to accept. Production instruction charts go deep into the basic-level groups and are the work pointers for workers, so they should first be simple, clear, and mass-oriented, so that workers can easily accept them and directly master them. For example, we convert the calculation of hourly output units into number of pieces, and the qualified product rate and scrap rate are also converted into number of pieces. In the process of preparation, we also pay attention to absorbing the opinions of veteran workers. In order to make it practical, easy to promote and implement, this point is very necessary.

    IV. Persuasion and education on several incorrect ideas. The process of implementing the production instruction chart system is a process of constantly overcoming conservative ideas and tendencies of blind adventurism.

    Before the establishment of the instruction chart system, some people said: The quality of the rolling rolls we are currently using is abnormal, there are many types of products, and the rolling sequence changes frequently. The instructions cannot be accurate. Only when conditions improve in the future can it be implemented. During the trial implementation, some group leaders said: The instruction chart is good, and the hourly tasks are clear; but faults cannot be avoided, and if an accident occurs, all the charts will be ruined. Others were afraid of trouble and thought it was better to do it "freely" as before. In particular, some workers associated the modification of the average advanced quota with piecework wages and thought that failing to complete the output quota of the instruction chart would result in a deduction of wages. Most of these concerns and the generation of incorrect ideas are due to an insufficient understanding of the basic purpose of implementing the instruction chart system and a failure to understand that the implementation of the instruction chart system is to more clearly expose the weak links in production and find ways to achieve balanced production. Therefore, repeated persuasion, education, and explanation must be carried out. The average advanced quota of our factory is often revised with the improvement of the production level, so as to maintain the accuracy and reality of the operational plan and instruction chart; although the quota is often slightly changed, the piecework wage does not change often. This reduces the cumbersome work in the quota modification process on the one hand and increases the timeliness of modifying the planned quota on the other hand. This issue should be explained to the workers in advance to avoid unnecessary ideological concerns. In addition, praise and rewards should be given to groups or individuals who are good at completing tasks through instruction charts; those who do not value or resist instruction charts should be criticized and punished.

    V. Strengthen the production responsibility system to ensure the completion of the tasks stipulated in the production instruction chart. If there is no individual responsibility system, the division of labor is not clear, no one is responsible for the maintenance and repair of machinery, and no one is responsible for checking the main production tools, complete operation cannot be guaranteed, and accidents occur continuously, then it will be difficult to complete the content stipulated in the instruction chart. Although we established various responsibility systems last year, they have not been implemented well enough, and accidents still occur from time to time, affecting the completion of the shift instruction chart. Investigating the root causes of accidents, most of them are caused by not carrying out good inspections in advance. To solve this problem, we must further strengthen the responsibility system, and strict regulations must be made on which machine is responsible for inspection, repair, and maintenance by which department and which person.

    VI. The chart system has just begun to be established in the medium-sized mill and is very incomplete. There are still many difficulties and problems that need to be gradually overcome and improved in the future:

    1. Due to the abnormal quality of the main production tools - rolling rolls and straightening rolls - sometimes the roll changing time cannot be controlled within the eight-hour shift operational plan, so the on-duty director and dispatching personnel can only find ways to deal with it flexibly.

    2. Currently, the work of some departments and personnel has not been included in the instruction chart, so there are still disconnection phenomena in the coordination work.

    3. The transportation aspect is not well integrated, and the backlog in the finished product yard is very serious, which needs to be solved by the transportation department.

    我们实行计划管理的经验
    鞍钢中型轧钢厂
    鞍山钢铁公司中型轧钢厂加强作业计划和建立生产指示图表制的工作，是从一九五二年第四季度开始的。试行的结果，很快地就基本上扭转了生产上先松后紧的不均衡现象。今年第一季度的十二个星期中，除了变更轧制品种次序和主要马达发生事故的三个星期外，其余九个星期，均衡率全是百分之百。二月份产量超过国家计划百分之二十，三月份超过百分之二十三点六八。第一季度的废品率，较去年第四季度降低百分之零点一九，合格品率较第四季度提高百分之一点二五，设备运用率亦提高百分之一点一。由于有了作业计划，生产能有准备地进行，因此月初就可以发现全月哪种原材料、哪种工具有问题，及时采取措施，避免了头痛医头、脚痛医脚的手工业管理方式。同时，由于建立了班的生产指示图表，工人们每小时都知道是否完成了任务，因此大大发挥了劳动积极性。
    作业计划是车间、工段、小组和各工序生产活动的具体计划。要做到有节奏的生产，就必须把作业计划做好。目前中型厂的作业计划有三种，即月作业计划、周作业计划和班作业计划。
    作业计划是根据国家规定的生产任务和订货品种以及本厂的生产技术经济条件（包括设备检修，设备能力和各种定额的要求）、原材料的储备和备品准备情况、运输力量的平衡、工人操作技术和上月完成任务的情况等来编制的。
    在编制作业计划时，首先要考虑下述各种条件，决定各种不同品种钢材的轧制次序：
    一、根据订户需要，每个月我们要生产很多不同钢质和不同规格的钢材，最多时达到三十四种。这些钢材，有的可以合并在一套轧滚上轧制，有的需要另换轧滚；如果换轧滚次数多，作业时间就会相对减少。因此对各种产品的次序，必须作合理的安排，尽量减少换轧滚的次数。另外，各种产品生产程序不同，如轧制轻轨必须矫直和加工，但目前矫直轻轨的能力仅及轧钢能力的三分之二，如果连续生产轻轨，厂房里就要积压。而大方钢、圆钢等，又不必矫直；因此，为了保持整个生产的均衡，在事先必须把最不易矫直的和不必矫直的产品适当地排开，以便充分发挥设备运用率。
    二、要配合检修工作。根据中型厂目前生产条件，轧制轻轨时经常使用柏油。柏油流到轧钢机下面和铁皮凝结在一起，挖取时比较困难，因而通常轧完轻轨的换滚时间需要十六小时到二十四小时（其他品种换滚时间只需六小时左右）。各工组检修机械，正好利用这个机会进行。为了适当间隔检修周期，如果上旬已轧制过轻轨，那么第二次轧制轻轨的时间就要排在中、下旬。
    三、三角钢规格较多，从最窄五十粍到最宽一百三十粍，共有二十种。最好先生产宽的，后生产窄的。这样矫直滚就可以多用几次，不仅有利于经济核算，还可以减轻修理工段的负担。
    四、轧滚、矫正滚都已准备妥当的产品排在上半月，给修理工段有足够的时间准备下半月的生产工具。
    五、月初轧制的产品，要注意现存的原料——钢坯是否够用。炼制比较困难的优质钢产品，则尽可能排在下半月，以免发生待料事故。
    六、除此以外，还得照顾订货的急缓。有的产品国家指定上旬需要，就不能坚持排在下旬轧制。
    其次，在编制作业计划时，要确定班产量，制定切合实际的平均先进产量定额。为了做到这一点，要经常研究和分析定额，发现了落后的不切合实际的定额，一定要结合实际情况和客观条件的发展，把它变成新的、可供遵守的、能推动生产前进的先进指标，纳入作业计划中去。例如去年十月轧制扁钢时，计划班产量（八小时）是一千一百根，每小时产量一百四十五根。轧制当中，轧钢甲班李尚林同志发明了铁簸箕的装置，产量立即上升，最后创造了每班生产一千四百七十三根的最高纪录。我们对这个班每小时的生产记录作了分析，算出了每小时的平均先进定额是二百十一根，然后便根据这个分析，确定了以每小时二百根为下次轧这种扁钢的定额。根据这个定额，每一班可轧一千五百根，超过了新纪录所达到的水平。
    在确定平均先进定额时，要注意结合实际情况。我们不采用平均的，也不采用最高的，并且还不根据单从表面数字计算出的所谓平均先进定额；而是根据每次轧制的实际小时产量和操作情况记录，分析产量高低的原因，然后订出切合实际的平均先进定额。这样的定额才会在群众中树立威信，才会使人遵守，才会推动生产，才会达到均衡。但有时因受到各方面的影响和限制，定额也会降低。例如三月份轧制一百一十粍方钢时，每小时产量定额是六十五根。因为钢坯烧得不够好，温度不均，产生了一些废品。四月份经苏联专家建议，将小时产量定额改为六十根，使按小时均衡生产，防止引起断滚事故；另一方面，我们便积极设法使钢坯能够做到充分加热，待下次轧制时还可恢复以前的定额。
    再次，排定了各种产品的生产次序，确定了作计划所依据的定额以后，就要计算确定生产每一种产品需要多少时间。例如，假定八公斤轻轨每班产量为一百五十吨，如果轧制一千五百吨，就需要十个班。但这中间还要加进去换滚时间。因为除了改换品种要换滚外，轧槽被磨损得不精确时也要换滚
    （前一种叫大换滚，后一种叫小换滚）。每套轧滚
    的质量不同，产量变动很大，即使在同一轧滚上，每个轧槽的能力也不尽相同。因此要确定每种产品的轧制时间，须对轧滚的能力进行调查，然后准确估计轧制能力。假定轧制一千五百吨的八公斤轻
    轨，中间小换滚三次需要一个班，大换滚一次需要一个班，那么一千五百吨轻轨就需要花费十二个
    班来完成（等于四天）。这样把全月每种产品的轧
    制时间加起来，恰好是全月的日历时间或者少于日历时间，那就表示有把握完成全月的品种和产量。为了保证完成国家任务，有时厂里订的计划较高，假如中途受到一点意外的影响，即使完不成本厂排订的较高计划，起码还可以完成国家任务。
    此外，作业计划中还要确定使用钢坯的钢质、规格和数量，据此编制钢坯供应指示图表。
    月作业计划的主要作用是：确定本厂的最高奋斗目标；确定轧制每种产品的起迄时间和全月检修时间，各工段可参照它，在事先做好生产准备工作。
    月作业计划的缺点是：没有订出每天每班的具体任务；有时变动性很大，不易控制。
    因此必须以周作业计划和班作业计划来补充月作业计划的不足之处。
    有了作业计划以后，我们就开始实行按指示图表组织有节奏的生产。在实行之前，去年第四季度，领导方面针对生产上所存在的严重的不均衡现象，采取了一系列的措施，及时克服薄弱的环节，给执行生产指示图制打下了有力基础。
    第一是改善了作业计划。首先制订了切合实际的平均先进定额（包括产量定额和消耗定额），对主要原材料的消耗定额进行精确的计算和进一步的严格控制，使供应保证生产，既不因缺乏原材料而停工，又不会因无计划而积压。通过指示图表，明确了生产需要，结合着先进指标，制订出合理的储备量，使生产稳步前进，供应部门也有所遵循，有条不紊地妥为配合，不致陷于被动的忙乱状态中。这样既合理地使用了原材料，也加速了企业的资金周转。同时指定专人调查了机械设备与效能。为了把作业计划编制得合理，必须了解主要设备的机械能力。在轧钢厂，对各种轧滚、矫正滚等主要生产工具的质量及其磨损情况，必须参照有关资料做出准确的估计。去年第四季度以前，轧滚、矫直滚的管理非常混乱，不仅质量和磨损情况记录得模糊，而且数量也不清楚。领导方面发现了这些问题，及时指定专责技术员进行整顿，把各种不同轧滚分类堆放，建立起卡片制度，登记台账。过去矫直工段的矫正滚满地乱放，这次也进行了清查，能够使用的和根本不能
    使用的，已经加工完了的和尚待加工的，都分别登记清楚。在这样的基础上再编制出主要生产工具准备指示图表，才能掌握住备品的及时供应，作到均
    衡的生产。
    第二是加强了调度机构。及时准确地编制了作业计划和指示图表，固然给实行计划生产创造了前提，但是并不等于就能把作业计划顺利地贯彻到生产中去。必须按时检查工作，加强和各方面的联系，根据生产中发生的问题主动及时地进行调度。这是保证按指示图表进行有节奏生产的关键。
    中型厂自一九五○年即建立了调度机构，昼夜三班均有调度人员。但是，调度的职责范围不十分明确，大部时间用来整理基层记录和编制统计表报，每天忙得很厉害，却很少和现场联系，缺乏预见性；遇到问题发生，才进行应付性的调度。结果问题解决得不及时或不正确，调度人员的工作情绪也受到影响。此外，调度人员又经常调动，稍有经验的调度员都调到了别的岗位上去了。一九五二年初，三个调度员全是新来的，对业务不熟悉，遇到问题就束手无策。
    去年第四季度，领导方面决心加强调度工作。首先制订出调度人员职责范围和工作细则，废弃了一些不起作用的表报；在主要工段和班组里安了电话，和调度室相通，调度人员可以随时检查生产情况，并及时向领导汇报。另外订出了制度，使调度人员有职有权，领导方面和各科室凡是向现场联系有关生产方面的工作，必须通过调度室。这样，实现均衡生产就有了保证。
    第三是加强技术管理。过去我们在这方面虽然有些制度，但未能全部贯彻。例如轧槽使用情况的记录有时间断，技术操作规程往往和实际脱节，因此不能保证质量，并且容易发生事故。特别是轧滚的车削工作，由于技术管理不严，结果上到轧钢机上轧不出钢。去年第四季度，领导方面追究出产生上列问题的根源，适当配备了技术人员，使他们做到尽职尽责，把过去不适用的旧制度、旧操作规程改变成为新的、结合实际的、能够推动生产的新制度和新操作规程。
    第四是配备干部深入车间，集中领导生产。生产指示图表代表严肃的组织性和纪律性，它规定工作人员的工作任务。如规定某一班在一定时间必须完成一定数量、一定质量的成品；规定某一班在某一时期要准备好某种工具；某一班在某一时期要准备
    好某种原料。因为要做到使各个方面密切配合起
    来，保持平衡的生产活动，所以必须在民主管理的基础上实施高度集中的领导。就是说，整个的企业活动，一定要在一个意志下进行，这样才不会各自为政，才可以避免只为自己好而不顾别人，或者妨碍别人。我们在没有实行指示图表制的时候，夜里生产无人负责，主要干部都在白班，虽有值班制度，但值班人员不了解情况，遇到问题发生，无法及时解决；领导干部在宿舍常被电话叫醒，一天二十四小时总是紧张的。一九五二年末，设立了随班的值班主任和值班工段长，三班的生产都有人领导和监督，并能及时检查和汇报，同时将调度工作划归值班主任直接领导，给推行指示图表制准备了极重要的先决条件。
    第五是整顿原始记录工作。原始记录是企业技术管理和经营管理的基础，原始记录工作的好坏，会直接影响到企业的经济核算和编制计划工作。
    几年来，原始记录和统计已给我们积累下好多资料，根据这些资料可以编制出各种定额和指示图表；但为了做到切合实际，不得不进一步加强原始记录。去年第四季度，领导方面发现了负责原始记录的组织机构不健全；工作质量不均衡；人员配备不适当；记录表格不统一；记录人员是三班制，很少参加各种活动和学习，以致政治认识和业务水平都远远赶不上实际工作的需要；同时岗位极不固定，流动性大。这些都直接影响记录数字不可靠，当然给编制统计表报、制订计划定额、衡量和分析企业的经济活动造成无法计算的损失。领导方面针对这些缺点，整顿了原始记录的组织机构，配备了记录人员，统一简化表格，组织业务学习，使记录人员的工作水平提高，认识到原始记录是整个企业最基层、最实际、分量相当沉重的重要的工作岗位，这样就发挥了记录人员的积极性。现在我们的原始记录虽然谈不到百分之百的准确，但大部数字都做到了接近可靠。
    除此以外，还健全了岗位专责制和交接班联系制度，明确了民主化管理，改革了组织机构，及时克服薄弱的环节，给执行生产指示图表制打下了有利基础。
    生产指示图表的执行制度是这样的：
    甲、计划生产科于每月二十八日前根据公司计划处所制定的生产任务和公司生产处的订货任务，结合本厂生产、工具、原材料准备情况和生产技术经济条件，做成下月的生产指示主图提要（月作业计划）交厂长审核。经厂长批准的生产指示主图提要，通过调度颁布到各工段各科室。
    乙、计划生产科根据主图提要（月作业计划）即时绘成生产指示图主图和生产准备工作指示图（包括原料——钢坯供应指示图，轧滚准备指示图，矫直滚准备指示图，导卫板准备指示图，煤炭、柏油、黄干油等消耗材料的准备指示图等）。
    每种图表各制两份到三份，一份挂厂长室，一份挂计划生产科（调度室在内），另外一份交给有关部门进行准备工作。图表制出以后，调度员要按班到厂长室填绘实际进度情况。厂长在月初召集干部会议，研究完成该月份的生产指示图应采取的各种措施，组织分工并指定完成日期。然后，由值班主任将生产指示图主图所指示的进度及有关要求，分别召开三班全体职工大会做传达报告。调度员根据每日具体情况，在不脱离生产指示主图的原则下，在接班前一小时编制下一班的生产指示图表，经计划生产科长与值班主任审核。上班前四十分钟，由值班主任召开十五分钟的工段、工组长会议，工段、工组长在会议上接受值班主任颁发的生产指示图表和操作规程执行指示表，值班主任并应根据各方面的意见，指示完成的办法。工组长回组后，利用十五分钟时间，向工人宣布并组织讨论生产指示图表，分配组内每个工人的具体工作；然后将生产指示图表交与记录员，填写在工作场附近的指示板上，并在执行当中按时填写工作情况。制度规定：每个工组必须严格地按照指示图表进行工作，保证全厂生产的均衡，不得拖延或打折扣。遇有拖延，应想尽一切办法在下班前追上。
    丙、各级对生产指示图表的任务是：
    生产科长为生产指示图表的确定者与监督实行者。值班主任为生产指示图表的直接推动者，将充实内容后的生产指示图表颁发各工组执行。
    工段长为生产指示图表的领导执行者。工组长为生产指示图表的执行者，他们负责依据生产指示图表和值班主任的指示，分配组内每个工人的具体工作。他们对指示图表能反映意见，但未经修改前无权增减图表的内容。工人接受组长的布置，根据岗位专责制，按照技术操作规程，负完成生产指示图表的专责任务。调度员为生产指示图表的编制者以及执行当中所发生的具体情况的掌握者，并负责协助值班主任及时处理脱节现象，并作记录，向有关方面反映意见。
    对生产指示图表执行情况的检查与报告，我们规定了如下的制度：
    在执行过程中，副组长负责质量的检查，组长应将生产情况报告给值班调度员。调度员检查执行的情况，如有不按指示图表进行者，应及时查明原因，报告值班主任和生产科长。下班后工组长将填好实际进度的指示图表送到调度室，同时向值班主任汇报指示图表完成情况及超过或未完成原因；未完成时，应向值班主任做检讨；另外还要汇报该组所发生的一切问题和对各部门的意见。值班主任对不按指示图表工作者须追究其责任，并应按班填写工作日记，将该班超过或未完成进度及发生意外事故的原因详细填写，工作中存在的问题和对有关部门有关人员的意见或要求也填在上面，此外，还须向生产副厂长当面汇报。调度员应将生产指示图表完成情况以及工作中存在的问题和预见到未来可能发生的问题向生产科长做分析性的汇报。计划生产科长在每次换轧滚会议上，向各工段工组长报告指示图表完成情况，同时研究、讨论如何完成指示图表，并将总结提交厂长。
    对生产指示图主图修改的手续，我们作了如下规定：变更生产指示图主图时，必须经厂长和公司生产处同意。执行过程中值班主任发现新的征候或执行困难时，须及时与计划生产科长研究修改意见；如果认为确有修改的必要时，得通过厂长和公司调度科，以指令修改之；认为无必要时，须指出具体办法。修改申请提出后，指令未修改前，各工段须按原定生产指示图执行。
    当各班生产与指示图表不符时，作如下处理：凡不超过十五分钟的局部检查及换轧槽、锯片等休转，组长须即时报告调度员。因其他工段或外厂供应中断，被迫停工时，须立即通过调度报告值班主任，听候指示。各工段如果发生事故，要影响其他工段的工作时，须请示值班主任，根据具体情况，通过调度下令改变有关工段之班生产指示图表，但与主图相违背时须请示厂长。除换轧槽、孔门、锯片以外，一切违背了每班生产指示图表的事情，都叫做事故。工段工组长必须在事故发生十分钟以内，将发生情形及处理意见，通过调度报告值班主任或厂长；值班主任必须亲自到发生地点，检查追明原因，并作处理，然后报告厂长。
    我厂推行按指示图表组织节奏生产的情况大体上就是这样。在推行的过程中，我们有这样几点体会：
       一、生产指示图表制的基本目的是达到均衡生产，并且使管理简易化。实行指示图表制后，我们每时每刻都可以看出各个环节的生产情况，会很明显地发现生产薄弱的环节，所以生产发展的过程（也可以说生产指示图表执行的过程），又是不断的寻找相对平衡，用突破薄弱环节的手段，以先进带动落后而达到相对平衡，再突破平衡，又达到生产相对平衡的过程。这就是管理生产所要注意的整个生产的平衡问题。有了薄弱环节，假如有突破的可能，就要以先进为标准突破它，使生产达到平衡；再进一步，使先进的再突破平衡，然后再去克服薄弱环节，再达到平衡。当然，这不能不根据设备能力、产品质量和成本，而单纯追逐数量。
    二、密切联系群众，工作才会作好。生产指示图表制是以一个统一的意志去领导生产的一种管理方法。它的基础是依靠职工自觉遵守的劳动纪律，因而它必须密切联系群众；尤其在今天计划管理工作跟不上生产发展的需要，我们还没有摸索出一套完整的办法之前，依靠工人群众就具有更大的意义。
    三、指示图表应简单明了易于使人接受。生产指示图表是深入到基层的班组里去的，是工人的工作指针，所以首先应当简单明了，群众化，这样才能使工人易于接受，才能直接为工人所掌握。如我们将每小时产量单位的计算，都折合成根数，合格品率、废品率也都折合成根数。在编制的过程中，也注意吸收老工人的意见。为了作到切合实际，易于推动和实现，这一点是十分必要的。
    四、对几种不正确思想的说服和教育。生产指示图表制执行的过程，是不断地克服保守思想及盲目冒进倾向的过程。
    在建立指示图表制以前，有的人说：我们目前使用的轧滚质量不正常，产品种类多，轧制次序经常变动，指示的不能正确，只有将来条件好转时才能实行。在试行当中，有的班长说：指示图好是好，每小时任务都明确了；但是故障不能避免，出了事故什么图表都完蛋啦。还有的人怕麻烦，认为不如以前那样干“自由”。特别是有的工人从平均先进定额的修改联想到计件工资方面去，以为完不成指示图表的产量定额会扣掉工资。类似这些顾虑和不正确思想的产生，大多数是由于对实行指示图表制的基本目的认识得不够清楚，没有理解到实行指示图表制是为了更明显地暴露出生产薄弱环节，而设法达到均衡生产。因此必须进行反复的说服、教育和解释。我厂的平均先进定额是随着生产水平的提高而时常修正的，这样才能保持作业计划和指示图表的准确性和现实性；定额虽然常有小的变更，但计件工资并不时常变动。这样一方面减少了定额修改过程中的繁琐工作，另一方面也增加了修改计划定额的及时性。这个问题应该事先向工人讲解清楚，以避免产生不必要的思想顾虑。另外，对善于通过指示图表完成任务的班组或个人应进行表扬和奖励；对不重视或抗拒指示图表的则应加以批评处分。
    五、加强生产责任制，以保证完成生产指示图表所规定的任务。如果没有个人专责制度，分工不明确，对机械的保养检修没有专人负责，主要的生产工具没有专人检查，完全运转就不能保证，事故连续发生，那么要完成指示图表所规定的内容就很困难。我们去年虽然建立了各种专责制度，但贯彻得还不够好，现在事故还时常发生，影响到班指示图表的完成。追究事故产生的根源，大多数是因事先没有进行很好的检查所造成。要解决这个问题，必须进一步加强责任制，那一台机器由那一部门、那一个人负责检查、检修和保养，都要做出严密的规定。
    六、图表制在中型厂刚开始建立，并且十分不完整，还有许多困难和问题需要今后继续设法逐渐克服和改进：
    1、由于主要生产工具——轧滚、矫直滚的质量不正常，有时在八小时的班作业计划内也控制不住换滚时间，只好让值班主任和调度人员机动地设法处理。
    2、目前还有一些部门和人员的工作没有编入指示图内，因此配合工作方面还存在脱节现象。
    3、运输方面结合得还不够好，成品场积压情形非常严重，需要运输部门设法解决。
