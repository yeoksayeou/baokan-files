The phenomenon of commodity stockpiles in cooperatives at all levels in the North China region is quite serious. According to statistics from provincial and special district-level wholesale stations alone, the inventory backlog amounts to more than 178.7 billion yuan. According to statistics from 95 county cooperatives in Shanxi Province, the backlog of goods amounts to 108.2 billion yuan; the Liancun Cooperative in Qukou, Xianghe County, Hebei Province, currently has an inventory backlog of 800 million yuan, exceeding three times its own capital. The large-scale backlog of goods has resulted in mutual arrears between upper and lower-level cooperatives. The mutual arrears between upper and lower-level cooperatives in Shanxi Province are nearly 400 billion yuan. Thirteen counties and one consumer cooperative in Dingxian Special District, Hebei Province, owe the special district cooperative more than 11.6 billion yuan; the grassroots cooperatives in eleven counties owe the county cooperative more than 15.9 billion yuan. This situation seriously affects the turnover of cooperative funds and causes huge losses to the cooperatives. Taking the goods stockpiled by provincial and special district-level wholesale stations as an example, the monthly loss of interest is more than 1.7 billion yuan.

What are the main reasons for the stockpiling phenomenon?

(1) Some leading cadres of cooperatives have serious bureaucracy, do not conscientiously investigate and study the needs of cooperative members, do not understand the purchasing power of the masses, and blindly purchase goods based on subjective wishes. This is the main factor causing the stockpile of goods. For example, the Shanxi Provincial Cooperative Union blindly purchased goods when participating in the North China Materials Exchange Fair in September 1952, with preliminary estimates of losses amounting to 2.5 billion yuan. Similar situations exist in Hebei Province. Statistics from Shijiazhuang Special District alone show that there are many goods purchased at the North China Materials Exchange Fair that are now stockpiled. For example, among the 200 kinds of commodities operated by Baode County Cooperative in Shanxi, 10 kinds of commodities have been stockpiled for more than one year, 11 kinds of commodities have been stockpiled for more than half a year, and 4 kinds of commodities have been stockpiled for more than three months, with a total value of more than 190 million yuan, accounting for 50.4% of the available working capital. The expensive instruments operated by the No. 1 District Cooperative in Tianjin, the glass socks operated by the No. 5 District Cooperative, and the goatskin gloves operated by the No. 6 District Cooperative have all been stockpiled for a long time.

(2) Higher-level cooperatives allocate goods blindly without a plan, and even "force allocation" by administrative means. For example, in the fourth quarter of last year, the Hebei Provincial Cooperative sent a telegram to the special district and county cooperatives, instructing them to sell out all the inventory goods, and convened a meeting of managers of directly affiliated business departments to make arrangements and carry out rigid commodity allocation at each level. Within three days, Dingxian Special District allocated the inventory goods of the special district cooperative to the county cooperatives in the name of credit sales, and the county cooperatives allocated them to the grassroots cooperatives. Because many goods did not meet the needs of the masses, it caused serious stockpiles. For example, the Tianjin Special District Cooperative allocated more than 18,000 boxes of toothpaste to a county, enough for the county cooperative to sell for three years; the Tongxian Special District Cooperative allocated 52 boxes of toothpaste to a grassroots cooperative at one time, but there were only 12 people using toothpaste in the cooperative's supply area. Therefore, the grassroots cooperative cadres reflected: "The higher-level cleared the warehouse, and the lower-level suffered." Seriously affecting the relationship between upper and lower-level cooperatives. Currently, the situation of the Hebei Provincial Cooperative is: the provincial cooperative's warehouse is empty and there are no goods, and the funds cannot be circulated; the grassroots cooperatives are piled up with goods like mountains, and the funds cannot be recovered, making the upper-level wholesale station lose its role in timely regulating the source of goods. There are four sentences among the cadres of the Hebei Provincial Cooperative: "Distrust and suspicion at all levels, everyone wants to fight for profits, forced allocation under pressure, stockpiles and arrears suffocate people," which fully illustrates the seriousness of this problem.

(3) Many cooperative cadres have serious supply system thinking and do not pay attention to economic accounting. Some believe that "business or no business, 120 points every month," "accounting or no accounting, business is still business." The higher-level cooperative's forced allocation of goods occupies the funds of the lower-level cooperative, losing the ability to operate independently and becoming dependent on the higher-level cooperative; if there is a shortage of goods, they ask the higher-level cooperative, and if they cannot sell it, they press it in the warehouse. They accept whatever the higher-level cooperative allocates, and they want as much as they send. "Anyway, it's not okay to lose money, and the higher-level cooperative has to find a way"; they do not conscientiously understand the needs of the cooperative members, do not actively improve their own operation and management, and do not study the circulation law of commodities. Some cooperative cadres even have capitalist business ideas, and for a few points of profit, the commodity circulation increases levels, increases costs, commodities are not easy to sell, and causes stockpiles. Many cooperatives do not have an accurate grasp of the specifications, quality, and seasonality of commodities. For example, in counties such as Daxing and Xianghe, table salt was in short supply during the mass pickling season, and then a large amount of table salt was shipped, and more than 300,000 catties are still stockpiled to this day. Xinle County only shipped red plum paper and peppercorns after the Spring Festival. This phenomenon is common.

(4) The cooperative warehouse system is chaotic, lacks a clear responsibility system, does not regularly take inventory, and the accounts do not match the actual goods. Because they do not understand the inventory situation, it also causes stockpiles. For example, Nanpi County, Hebei Province, could not buy sulfur cyanide for a long time, and it was only discovered during inventory that there were 20 large barrels in stock. Ma Wenzheng, of the Yueyang Road distribution office in the fifth district of Tianjin, asked the district cooperative for Weierfu and blood-washing mirrors several times, and the district cooperative said they didn't have any, but he didn't believe it, and when he went to the warehouse to check, there were many goods in stock. The Suiyuan Provincial Cooperative stored more than 20 horses and 200 sheep in a banner cooperative. The provincial cooperative had already reported the loss, but it was only discovered during the property inventory of the banner cooperative that it belonged to the provincial cooperative. In addition, some cooperative commodities in some areas are stockpiled due to the merger of organizational structures, which concentrated cold-back goods, and the lack of active promotion. Zhangjiakou Special District in Hebei Province currently has 35 billion yuan of cold-back goods, most of which were transferred when the Chahar South and Chahar North Special District Cooperatives and the Chahar Provincial Cooperative merged with the Native Produce Company.

(5) After the adjustment of commerce, some areas mechanically implemented the price adjustment policy, making the prices of cooperative commodities higher than the market price; some blindly abolished institutions and commodity types; some institutions, schools, factories, rural mutual aid groups, and urban residents organized to wholesale goods from state-owned companies, which affected the decline of cooperative business. According to statistics from eight counties in Tongxian Special District, Hebei Province, only 58% of the supply plan was completed in February. The No. 2 District Cooperative in Baoding City sold 2 billion yuan of grain in December, and only 590 million yuan in January. In addition, some areas neglected business during the rectification of the cooperative. For example, 62% of the cadres of the grassroots cooperatives in Tangshan Special District were concentrated in the county cooperative for training, and even Dingxian Special District had the tendency to leave only one person to watch the door in each cooperative, which also affected the decline of business and caused the stockpile of goods.

The above situation shows that the stockpile of goods is a serious problem that urgently needs to be solved in the current implementation of the economic accounting system in cooperatives. To completely solve this problem, it is necessary to emphasize conscientiously investigating and studying the needs of cooperative members and formulating correct business plans, which is the basis for promoting the economic accounting system and accelerating turnover. Secondly, it is necessary to oppose the phenomenon of forcing tasks and rigidly allocating goods regardless of the needs of lower-level cooperatives and cooperative members. The following measures can be taken to solve the current stockpiled goods:

1. On the principle of not affecting and helping the supply business, universally launch a sales campaign to eliminate stockpiles. To this end, we must first conscientiously and thoroughly conduct a warehouse inventory and sorting, specifically analyze and study various commodities, and divide them into fast-selling, cold-back, and slow-moving goods, and make specific sales recovery plans to carry out sales in a planned manner. Prevent blind and unplanned actions. The second is to organize material exchanges between cooperatives and state-owned companies to exchange what is available for what is needed; adopt the method of bringing goods to the countryside and combining procurement, and exchanging industrial products for marketable agricultural and sideline products for sales. However, we should prevent the style of coercion and command and the tendency of blind allocation. Third, seize the opportunity to sell fast-selling goods; for cold-back and slow-moving goods, after accurate accounting, adopt short-term credit sales or discounted sales, or process or refit them according to the needs of cooperative members.

2. The handling of commodity stockpiles should be carried out from bottom to top, with an eye to the overall situation, and strictly prevent the tendency of "higher-level clearing the warehouse, and the lower-level suffering" from continuing to occur. If the lower-level cooperative has too much stockpile, the higher-level cooperative should assist in sales. The higher-level cooperative should be responsible for the stockpile caused by the "forced allocation" of the higher-level cooperative. The solution is: one is for the lower-level cooperative to sell on consignment, all expenses are borne by the higher-level cooperative, and the lower-level cooperative is given a certain commission fee; the second is to return the commodities that cannot be truly sold locally to the higher-level cooperative for processing.

3. For the stockpiles caused by blind procurement at the North China Materials Exchange Fair in September last year, the principle of adhering to contract credit must still be adhered to, but if there is truly too much stockpile and cannot be solved by itself, it can take the initiative to negotiate with relevant departments, and after obtaining the consent of the other party, it can appropriately stop some contracts and agreements. The stockpiled goods that cannot be handled by the cooperatives at all levels themselves should be reported to the higher-level cooperatives level by level for assistance in solving.

4. Strictly control the purchase plan and strengthen the combination of business, accounting, and storage and transportation departments. Do not purchase any more goods that are currently stockpiled and have not been processed; however, it is necessary to prevent the tendency of out-of-stock due to the processing of stockpiles and the failure to purchase commodities needed by cooperative members.

    华北区合作社为什么积压了大量商品
    华北供销合作总社办公室
    华北区各级合作社商品积压的现象相当严重。目前仅据省、专级批发站统计，库存积压即达一千七百八十七亿余元。另据山西省九十五个县合作社统计，积压商品一千零八十二亿元；河北省香河县渠口联村社现在库存积压达八亿元，超过自有资金的三倍。由于商品的大批积压，造成了上下级社之间的互相拖欠。山西省上下级社间互相拖欠近四千亿元。河北省定县专区十三个县及一个消费社拖欠专区社资金一百一十六亿余元；十一个县的基层社拖欠县社一百五十九亿余元。这一情况严重地影响了合作社资金的周转，使合作社受到了巨大的损失。以省、专级批发站积压的商品为例，每月即损失利息十七亿多元。
    造成积压现象的主要原因何在呢？
    （一）有些合作社的领导干部，有严重的官僚主义，不认真地调查研究社员群众的需要，不了解群众的购买力，多从主观愿望出发，盲目进货，这是造成商品积压的主要因素。譬如山西省合作社联合社在一九五二年九月间参加华北物资交流会时，盲目进货，初步估计损失二十五亿元。河北省亦有类此情况，仅石家庄专区统计，现在积压华北物资交流会上购进的商品就很多。又如山西保德县合作社在经营的二百种商品中，有十种商品积压一年以上，有十一种商品积压半年以上，有四种商品积压三个月以上，总值一亿九千余万元，占自有流动资金的百分之五十点四。天津市一区社经营的高贵仪器，五区社经营的玻璃袜子，六区社经营的鸡皮手套等，都是长期积压着。
    （二）上级社不按计划，盲目拨货，甚至以行政方式“强拨硬塞”。如河北省社在去年第四季度曾电示各专、县社将库存商品全部售完，并召开了直属经理部经理会议作了布置，开展了逐级硬性的商品大调拨。定县专区三日内以赊销名义，将专社库存商品拨给了县社，县社又拨给了基层社，因有许多商品不适合群众需要，造成了严重的积压。如天津专区社拨给一县一万八千多盒牙膏，该县社可销三年；通县专区有一个县社一次拨给一个基层社五十二箱牙膏，但该社供应区内只有十二个人用牙膏。因此，基层社干部反映说：“上级清了仓，下级遭了殃”。严重的影响了上下级社的关系。目前，河北省合作社的情况是：省社库空无货，资金不能周转；基层社则货物堆积如山，资金不能回笼，使上级批发站失掉了及时调剂货源的作用。在河北省合作社干部中有这样四句话：“层层怀疑不相信，上下都想争利润，压着头皮硬拨货，积压拖欠撑死人”，这充分说明了这一问题的严重性。
    （三）不少合作社干部有严重的供给制思想，不注意经济核算。有的认为“买卖作不作，每月一百二十分”，“核算不核算，一样作买卖”。上级社硬拨货，使下级社的资金占压，失去了独立经营的能力，而依附了上级社；缺货就向上级社要，销不了就压在仓库里，上级社拨来啥接啥，送来多少要多少，“反正赔垮了不行，上级社得给想法”；不去认真地了解社员需要，不积极地改进自己的经营管理，不去研究商品的流转规律。甚至有些合作社干部存有资本主义经营思想，为了几分利润，使商品流转增加了层次，加大了成本，商品不易出售，造成了积压。许多合作社对商品的规格、质量和季节性研究掌握的不够准确。如大兴、香河等县在群众腌菜时节，食盐供不应求，嗣后运来大批食盐，到现在还积压三十多万斤。新乐县春节后才运来了红梅纸和花椒。这种现象是普遍的。
    （四）合作社仓库制度混乱，缺乏明确的责任制，不经常盘点货物，账实不符，因不了解库存情况，也造成积压。如河北省南皮县长期买不到硫化氰，到清仓时才发现库存二十大桶。天津五区岳阳道分销处向区社要了几次维尔肤、洗血镜，区社说没有，但该处马文正同志不相信，到仓库察看时，存货很多。绥远省社在一旗社存马二十多匹、羊二百多只，省社早报了损失，但在旗社清理财产时才发现是省社的。此外，有些地区合作社的商品是由于组织机构合并，冷背货因而集中，又没有主动地积极推销而积压的。河北省张家口专区现有冷背货三百五十亿元，其中大部分是由察南、察北专区社和察哈尔省社与土产公司合并时移交的。
    （五）调整商业后，由于有些地区机械地执行调价政策，使合作社商品价格高于市价；有的盲目撤销机构和商品种类，有的机关、学校、工厂、农村互助组、城市居民组织起来向国营公司批货，以致影响合作社业务的下降。据河北省通县专区八个县统计，二月份供应计划只完成了百分之五十八。保定市二区社十二月销售粮食二十亿元，一月份只销售了五亿九千余万元。此外，合作社在整社中，部分地区忽视业务。如唐山专区基层社百分之六十二的干部集中在县社整训，甚至定县专区曾发生每社只留一人看门的偏向，也是影响业务下降而造成商品积压的原因之一。
    上述情况说明：商品积压是目前合作社推行经济核算制中急待解决的严重问题。为彻底解决这一问题，必须强调认真地调查研究社员需要，制订正确的业务计划，这是推行经济核算制、加速周转的基础。其次，必须反对不顾下级社和社员的需要而强派任务、硬性拨货的现象。对目前积压的商品可以采取下列措施，加以解决：
    一、在不影响并有助于供应业务的原则下，普遍开展一个消除积压的销货运动。为此，首先必须认真地彻底地进行一次清仓排队，对各种商品加以具体地分析研究，划分为顺销、冷背、滞销货，作出具体销售回笼计划，有计划地进行销售。防止盲目无计划的行动。其次是组织合作社之间与国营公司之间的物资交流，互调有无；采取带货下乡、结合收购，以工业品换有销路的农副产品的方式进行销售。但应防止强迫命令的作风和盲目调拨的偏向。其三，对顺销货要抓住时机进行出售；对冷背、滞销货可经过精确核算后，采用短期赊销或贬价出售，或根据社员需要，进行加工或改装。
    二、处理商品积压，应由下而上地进行，从全面着眼，严防“上级清了仓，下级遭了殃”的偏向继续发生。若下级社积压过多，上级社应协助推销。因上级社“强拨硬塞”而造成下级社积压的，应由上级社负责。其解决办法：一是由下级社代销，一切费用由上级社负担，并给予下级社一定的手续费；二是将当地真正不能推销的商品退回上级社处理。
    三、在去年九月华北物资交流会上由于盲目采购而造成积压的，原则上仍须坚持合同信用，但真正积压过多，本身不能解决的，可主动地与各有关部门商洽，在取得对方同意后，可适当地停止一部分合同和协议。各级社本身不能处理的积压的商品，应逐级报上级社协助解决。
    四、严格控制进货计划，加强业务、会计、储运部门的结合。凡目前积压而未处理的商品，不再进货；但必须防止因处理积压，不采购社员需要的商品，而形成脱销的偏向。
