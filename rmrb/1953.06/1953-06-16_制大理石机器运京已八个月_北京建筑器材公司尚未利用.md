    Marble Making Machine Shipped to Beijing for Eight Months
    Beijing Building Materials Company Still Not Utilizing It
    Reader Yi Haipeng writes: To meet the needs of the capital's construction, the Beijing Building Materials Company purchased a complete set of marble-making machines from Shanghai in September of last year, along with 17 technicians. The machine parts arrived in Beijing in early October of the same year, but the company, due to its inability to determine a factory site, has left the machine parts in the open air, exposed to the sun and rain. To this day, there is still no installation date. For the past eight months, these 17 technicians have been receiving their salaries on time, but have nothing to do.
    As far as I know, there are very few marble-making machines in China (Shenyang has a small factory, but its output cannot meet market demand), but the Beijing Building Materials Company, despite purchasing the machines, is not actively seeking ways to start production. Once construction projects require large quantities, it will inevitably lead to a situation of supply falling short of demand. I believe this is one example of state-owned enterprises lacking planning in their work and being poor at careful budgeting. I suggest the Beijing Municipal People's Government find a way to resolve this.

### 制大理石机器运京已八个月  北京建筑器材公司尚未利用

专栏：读者来信摘要

    制大理石机器运京已八个月
    北京建筑器材公司尚未利用
    读者易海鹏来信：为适应首都建设需要，北京市建筑器材公司于去年九月间，自上海购得制大理石的全套机器，并随来技工十七人。机件于同年十月初运达北京，但该公司却因厂址未能确定，把机件放在露天地里，任凭日晒雨淋，至今尚无安装日期；八个月来，这十七名技术工人，则按时拿薪，无事可做。
    据我所知：国内能制大理石的机器很少（沈阳有一处小型厂，产量不能满足市场需要），而北京建筑器材公司购得机器却不积极设法进行生产，等建筑工程一旦大量需要时，则必然造成供不应求的现象。我认为这是国营企业工作无计划，不善于精打细算的事例之一。建议北京市人民政府设法解决。
