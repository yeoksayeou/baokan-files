    I am nurturing a new generation for the motherland
    He Jiahui, Delegate to the Second National Youth Congress of China, Special Model Nursery Teacher of Beijing
    I am a nursery teacher at the Xinhua Nursery in Beijing. I feel very honored to be able to attend the grand Second National Youth Congress of China as a representative of young childcare workers and to have the opportunity to speak at the congress.
    Before liberation, under the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, my family lived a very hard life. To earn some pocket money to subsidize the family, I did handicrafts and planted toothbrush bristles for others when I was a child. After liberation, the Communist Party brought freedom and happiness to us working people, and my family got better day by day. My elder brother and sister found jobs, and my two younger brothers also went to the children's school for employees.
    In 1950, the Beijing Democratic Women's Federation introduced me to work at the Beijing Xinhua Nursery. When I started working, a large group of children surrounded me, some crying, some shouting, some wanting to defecate, and some wanting to urinate, which made me very flustered. In the evening, I had to wash their feet and bottoms. Under these circumstances, I thought: "Is this also considered revolutionary work? What future is there in looking after children all day long? Others are contributing to the motherland, but my life is over." When classmates and relatives asked me where I worked, I didn't want to tell them. I just said I worked at the Xinhua News Agency, for fear that people would laugh at me if they knew.
    Later, thanks to the continuous cultivation and education of the Communist Party and the Youth League, and through movements such as the Resist America, Aid Korea, and ideological remolding, I gradually raised my political awareness and began to realize that I was the master of the new society and that there was no distinction between high and low in revolutionary work. At the same time, through professional studies, I also realized the importance of my work and realized that I was nurturing a new generation for the motherland.
    From then on, I kept studying my profession and worked hard to learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union. After listening to two reports by the Soviet childcare expert Gorina, I deeply felt that it was not easy to do this job well. Childcare workers should not only have excellent qualities and work style, but also understand children's psychology and medical and hygiene knowledge. This was indeed a difficulty for me, but when I thought of the moving deeds of heroes and models such as Guo Junqing and Hao Jianxiu, I gained infinite strength and strengthened my confidence and courage to overcome difficulties.
    In my work, I always remember what the Soviet expert Gorina said: "There are no bad children, only bad parenting methods." I studied the psychological characteristics of each child, studied parenting methods, and constantly improved my work. For example, one child was very naughty. During nap time, he always pretended to cough, letting the other children make noise with him. After understanding his psychological characteristics, I would gently walk up to him every nap time and persuade him to sleep well in a kind manner. After several educations, he slowly changed his past attitude and quieted down during nap time. For another example, children like to play with their favorite things before morning exercises or classes and are unwilling to let go. In the past, we often adopted harsh methods, snatching things from the children's hands and hiding them, coaxing the children to say that they had "flown away." As a result, the children were very unhappy, and some even cried. Later, I used patient persuasion to persuade them to put down the things and give them to me for safekeeping, and I assured them that I would return them later. The children trusted me. They said, "Aunt He Jiahui is right." In addition, I usually use various methods to cultivate children's good habits of cherishing public property.
    I love my work so much. However, my family still looks at me with the old society's perspective, and they all disagree with me doing childcare work. Especially my father, he opposed it the most. Once my father said to me: "Child, your sister's job is better than yours. She earns 110 points a month, but you only have 76 points. What future is there in looking after other people's children all the time? You should still come back with me! I have already found a job for you." At that time, I turned around and firmly replied to him: "I love my job, and I will never leave!"
    In 1952, I gloriously joined the Youth League and was elected as a special model nursery teacher in Beijing. This is the glory given to me by the motherland and the people, and the glory given to me by the Communist Party and Chairman Mao.
    In the future, I will better serve the fathers and mothers who are participating in the construction of the motherland and nurture a new generation for the motherland!

    我为祖国培育着新的一代
    中华全国青年第二次代表大会代表  北京市特等模范教养员  贺家蕙
    我是北京新华托儿所的一个教养员。这次我能作为一个青年保育工作者的代表来参加盛大的中华全国青年第二次代表大会，并且有机会在大会上说话，我感到非常的荣幸。
    解放以前，在国民党反动派的统治下，我的家庭生活很苦。我为了挣些零钱补贴家用，小时候就给别人作手工活，栽牙刷。解放以后，共产党为我们劳苦人民带来了自由和幸福，我的家里也一天天好起来了。我的哥哥和妹妹找到了工作，两个弟弟也上了职工子弟学校。
    一九五○年，北京市民主妇女联合会介绍我到北京新华托儿所去工作。开始工作的时候，一大群孩子围着我，这个哭那个叫，这个要拉屎，那个要尿尿，急得我乱成一团。到了晚上，还要替他们洗脚、洗屁股。在这种情形下，我就想：“这也算是革命工作吗？整天地看孩子有甚么前途呢？别人都对祖国有贡献，我这辈子算完了。”同学和亲戚朋友问起我在那里工作的时候，我也不愿意告诉他们，只说在新华社工作，怕人家知道了要笑话。
    后来，由于共产党和青年团不断的培养和教育，通过抗美援朝、思想改造等运动，我逐步地提高了政治觉悟，开始认识到自己是新社会的主人，认识到革命工作没有高低贵贱的分别。同时经过业务学习，我又认识到我的工作的重要性，认识到我是为祖国培育着新的一代。
    从此以后，我就不断地钻研业务，努力学习苏联的先进经验。在听过苏联保育专家戈林娜的两次报告以后，我深深地感到要作好这件工作真不简单，保育工作者不仅要具备优良的品质和工作作风，还要懂得儿童心理，又要懂得医药、卫生知识。这对我来讲确是一个困难，但是当我想到郭俊卿、郝建秀等英雄模范的动人事迹时，就增长了无限的力量，加强了克服困难的信心和勇气。
    在工作中，我时时刻刻记着苏联专家戈林娜讲过的一句话：“没有不好的孩子，只有不好的教养方法。”我研究了每一个孩子的心理特点，又研究了教养方法，不断改进自己的工作。比如有一个孩子非常顽皮，在睡午觉的时候，他总是假装咳嗽，让其它孩子和他一块吵闹。我了解了他的心理特点以后，每逢午睡时就轻轻地走到他身边，用和蔼的态度低声劝他好好睡觉。经过几次教育，他慢慢地改变了过去的态度，在睡午觉的时候安静下来了。又如，孩子们在早操或上课前喜欢玩弄自己所心爱的东西，不肯放手。以前我们往往采取生硬的办法，把东西从小朋友手中抢过来，并把它藏起来，哄孩子说“飞掉”了。因此孩子们很不高兴，有的甚至哭起来。后来我用耐心说服的方法，劝他们把东西放下来交给我保管，并向他们保证过后一定交还给他们。孩子们就信任起我来了，他们说：“贺家蕙阿姨的话没有错。”另外，我平时还用各种方法培养孩子们爱护公共财物的良好习惯。
    我是这样地热爱着我自己的工作。但是我家里的人仍然用旧社会的眼光来看待我，他们都不同意我作保育工作。特别是我的父亲，他反对得最厉害。有一次父亲对我讲：“孩子，你妹妹的工作比你好，
    一个月挣一百一十分，你却只有七十六分，老给人家看孩子有什么前途呢？你还是跟我回去吧！工作我已经给你找好了。”当时我就转过身来坚决地回答他说：“我爱我的工作，我决不走！”
    一九五二年我光荣地加入了青年团，同时被选为北京市特等模范教养员。这是祖国和人民给我的光荣，是共产党和毛主席给我的光荣。
    今后我要更好地为参加祖国建设的父亲、母亲们服务，为祖国培养新的一代！
