    Heroic Wingman Pilot Jiao Jingwen
    Hou Zupel

    I
    The air battle ended, and on the front-line airfield in Korea, our eagles returned one by one. Usually, Jiao Jingwen, Wang Hai's wingman, was right behind him when landing, but this time Jiao Jingwen's plane was not seen.
    Everyone was waiting anxiously, and Wang Hai looked particularly worried. How could he not be anxious? He himself shot down or damaged nine enemy planes, and the unit he commanded shot down or damaged ××× enemy planes. Which victory could be separated from Jiao Jingwen's name? Therefore, whenever someone praised Wang Hai for the achievements of his air force unit, he always liked to answer with this sentence: "A very important point is because I have an excellent wingman." Now, this outstanding wingman pilot did not return after the fierce air battle in which they achieved a major victory. Just when everyone was extremely anxious, with a low roar of the engine, a plane slowly and laboriously landed on the runway. Anxiety immediately turned into joy, and everyone rushed to greet him. Wang Hai squeezed out of the crowd to shake his hand, and the comrades also asked him about his well-being. At this time, everyone discovered that there were more than twenty bullet holes in the plane, and then they understood the reason why this heroic wingman pilot returned alone late.
    This happened on December 3, 1952.
    On this day, a team of Chinese People's Volunteer Army Air Force planes led by Wang Hai encountered a "F-86" enemy aircraft group in the skies over a certain place in Korea, which were covering the attacking aircraft committing atrocities against the Korean people, and then a fierce battle unfolded. The number of enemy planes was almost four times ours. Jiao Jingwen thought: I must protect the lead plane well so that the lead plane can calmly command the troops. The enemy tried to attack Wang Hai several times, but was driven away by Jiao Jingwen. The last time, four enemy planes suddenly followed them, Jiao Jingwen saw it and immediately reported to the lead plane Wang Hai to let him disengage, and at the same time prepared to turn sharply to drive away the enemy, but the enemy planes behind had already opened fire. At this time, Jiao Jingwen only needed to rise sharply to avoid the enemy's shooting, but in this way the lead plane would be attacked by the enemy. Jiao Jingwen immediately dodged the enemy's shooting with a clever movement, and at the same time attracted the enemy's attention to himself, and the lead plane quickly disengaged from the enemy's range. The enemy was still not reconciled, and two of the enemy planes flew quickly to Jiao Jingwen's front, attempting to attack Wang Hai. At this time, Jiao Jingwen's plane had already been wounded, and the other two enemy planes behind were still firing at him. But he did not forget the main responsibility of the wingman - to protect the safety of the lead plane. Jiao Jingwen's heart was on fire. He slammed the plane, which was no longer flexible, and fired a burst of fire at the two enemy planes in front, scaring the enemy to drill down in a hurry. At the same time that Jiao Jingwen was shooting at the enemy planes, the enemy planes behind him hit his plane several times, but what he cared about was still the safety of the lead plane. He reported to Wang Hai: "My plane is injured, and now I am entangled with two enemy planes, you must pay attention to the rear!" He finally saw the lead plane safely shooting at the enemy plane, and he was relieved.
    Two enemy planes were still staring at him tightly. He constantly made skillful movements to make it difficult for the enemy to aim, but his plane was wounded again. At this time, he was still very calm. He thought: "Although I have completed the task of protecting the lead plane, I still have to fly the plane back safely." The enemy plane continued to shoot at him, and tracer bullets flashed around his plane. He didn't care about these, and finally got rid of the enemy plane and flew back safely.
    In this air battle, Jiao Jingwen faithfully fulfilled the duties of the wingman, protecting the lead plane to carry out five consecutive attacks on the enemy, driving the enemy from a high altitude of 12,000 meters to a low altitude of 1,500 meters; enabling Wang Hai to calmly command the troops, defeating the enemy in only fifteen minutes, and shooting down three and damaging three enemy planes. After he came back, when he heard the mechanical comrades say that his plane could be repaired in a few days, he said: "I will drive this plane to protect my lead plane and shoot down more enemy planes!"
    This is one of the many fierce air battles that Jiao Jingwen participated in. This heroic wingman pilot has not only shot down and damaged four enemy planes, but more importantly, he has excellently completed the task of protecting the lead plane. In order to commend his achievements, the leading organ of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army Air Force specially awarded him the glorious title of "Second-Class Combat Hero" and "Special-Class Meritorious Person", and the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea awarded him the "First-Class Soldier's Honor Medal". Two evenings later, I went to Jiao Jingwen's dormitory to visit him. Walking into the small house, my eyes were immediately fixed on the color portrait of Wang Hai on the wall above his bed. I couldn't help but think of the unanimous praise of the comrades who had seen this scene: This is a portrayal of the heroic combat friendship.
    We started by talking about today's battle. I asked him to talk about what he was thinking when his plane was already injured and the enemy was still shooting non-stop. He immediately replied: "Protecting the lead plane to safely continue to attack the enemy plane is the task of the wingman."
    After a while, he seemed to know that I was not satisfied with such an answer, and then continued: "I think you must know that there are many such things in the Chinese People's Volunteer Army ground forces: When the commander jumps out of the bunker, braving the enemy's artillery fire, and directs the troops to charge towards the enemy, the guard is always closely following him. If the enemy's shells explode near him, the guard will suddenly pounce on the commander, protecting him with his own life. Because he knows that the commander is related to the victory of the entire unit. That's what I thought.
    "Of course, this is not only thought of in battle. From the day Wang Hai and I were assigned together, I thought about it: ensuring his safety is the task assigned to me by the motherland. Therefore, I was prepared to resolutely not let the enemy's bullets hit Wang Hai's plane under any circumstances. I once swore: To be loyal to the motherland is to be loyal to my duty; to love the motherland is to love my lead plane."
    This heroic wingman pilot has always been loyal to his solemn oath.
    Then he told me about another battle. That was on November 18, 1951. That day, when they appeared in front of eight enemy planes, the enemy planes immediately formed a large circle one after another. The enemy's method was extremely cunning. If you hit the first one, you would be attacked by the one behind it. If you don't hit it, it will drop bombs and indiscriminately bomb the Korean people. Wang Hai saw this clearly, and Jiao Jingwen also understood; Wang Hai rushed down, and Jiao Jingwen followed closely. Sure enough, when Wang Hai was shooting at the first enemy plane, the second enemy plane secretly raised its nose, attempting to attack Wang Hai. Before the bullets of this second enemy plane were fired, Jiao Jingwen quickly fired dense fire at it, and it had to lower its nose and retreat. However, the third enemy plane was also firing at him at this time. The situation was very obvious. If he continued to hit the second enemy plane, he would be very dangerous; if he turned around and fought head-on with the third enemy plane, he could immediately stop its frenzied shooting and possibly shoot it down; however, the more critical situation was that Wang Hai was about to be attacked. At this time, the bullets fired by the third enemy plane were passing around him, but his plane did not deviate by one degree, and still rushed towards the second enemy plane, firing a long string of fire. This enemy plane was shot down by him, and Wang Hai also shot down and damaged two enemy planes.
    While Jiao Jingwen was talking, he was playing with a small cloth bag. In my memory, this bag has never left him, and I asked curiously: "What is in this?" He smiled and said: "You take a look!" I took it over and looked at it, and it turned out that this was a small candy bag given to the volunteer soldiers by the Chinese People's Delegation to Korea, but it contained a small diary, which recorded the battle situation and drew some battle diagrams. He saw that I was very interested in this thing, and explained to me:
    "The superiors require us to maintain twin-plane coordinated operations, so we closely form pairs of twin planes. However, because the movements in battle are so intense, the plane speed is so fast, and the sky is so wide, even if there is a difference of one or two seconds in the movements of the two people, it is possible to lose visual contact. Therefore, I have thought of many ways to maintain twin-plane coordinated operations. The first is to be familiar with everything about Comrade Wang Hai, even the smallest things. For example, I can hear whether it is his voice from the extremely noisy radio. However, the most important thing is to be familiar with his thoughts, tactical movements and characteristics. I record these in this notebook and often ponder them. In this way, I can better keep up with him, move like one person, and better protect him."
    At this time, I understood the meaning of the small notebook in the comfort candy bag even more. It symbolizes the heroic wingman pilot's infinite love for the motherland and the lead plane. It is this lofty love that has made him always loyal to his solemn oath: "To be loyal to the motherland is to be loyal to my duty; to love the motherland is to love my lead plane." (Attached picture)

    英勇的僚机飞行员焦景文
    侯祖沛
    一
    空战结束了，在朝鲜前线的野战机场上，我们的雄鹰一架架地归来了。平常，紧跟着王海着陆的，总是他的僚机焦景文，可是这次却没有看到焦景文的飞机。
    大家都在不安地等待着，王海的神情显得特别焦急。他怎么能不焦急？他自己一共打落打伤九架敌机，他指挥的部队一共打落打伤×××架敌机，哪一次的战绩能和焦景文的名字分得开呢？所以每当有人向王海称赞他这支空军部队的战绩时，他老爱用这一句话来回答：“其中很重要的一点是因为我有一架出色的僚机”。现在，这位出色的僚机飞行员却在取得重大胜利的激烈空战后没有归来。正在大家万分焦虑的当儿，随着一阵马达低沉的轰鸣，一架飞机缓缓地吃力地降落到跑道上了。焦虑一下变成了惊喜，大家拥了上去迎接他，王海从人丛中挤出来和他握手，同志们也问长问短。就在这时候，大家发现这架飞机上有二十几个打穿的窟窿，这才明白这位英勇的僚机飞行员独自迟迟归来的原因。
    这是一九五二年十二月三日的事情。
    这一天，王海领着的志愿军空军的一队飞机，在朝鲜某地上空和那些掩护冲击机向朝鲜人民逞凶的“F—八六”敌机群遭遇了，接着就展开了激烈的战斗。敌机的数量几乎是我们的四倍。焦景文想：一定要好好掩护长机，使长机能够从容地指挥部队。敌人几次想偷袭王海，都被焦景文打跑了。最末一次，四架敌机突然从他们后面跟了上来，焦景文看到了，立即报告长机王海叫他脱离，同时准备急转过来驱逐敌人，但是后面的敌机已经开火了。这时候，焦景文只要猛一上升就可以避开敌人的射击，可是这样长机就要遭受敌人的袭击。焦景文马上用
    一个机灵的动作，闪开了敌人的射击，同时把敌人的注意力吸引到自己这方面来，长机就迅速地脱离了敌机的射程。敌人还不死心，其中有两架敌机飞速地冲到焦景文的面前，企图向王海攻击。这时候，焦景文的飞机已经负伤了，而且后面的另外两架敌机还在继续向他开火。但他并没有忘记僚机主要的职责——掩护长机的安全。焦景文心似火烧，他把操纵已经不灵活的飞机猛地一带，照准前面的两架敌机狠狠地开了一阵炮，吓得敌人一溜烟钻了下去。就在焦景文向敌机射击的同时，后面的敌机又好几次击中了他的飞机，但他关心的仍然是长机的安全，他向王海报告：“我的飞机负伤了，现在正和两架敌机纠缠，你要注意后面！”他终于看到长机安全地向敌机射击了，他才放心地舒了一口气。
    两架敌机仍然紧紧地盯着他，他不断地做着机巧的动作，使敌人不容易瞄准，但他的飞机又负了伤。这时他依然很沉着，他想：“我虽然已经完成了掩护长机的任务，但是我还要把飞机安全地驾回去。”敌机继续向他射击，曳光弹在他的飞机四周闪耀着，他不管这些，最后终于撇开了敌机，安全地飞了回来。
    在这次空战中，焦景文忠实地执行了僚机的职责，掩护长机连续向敌人进行了五次攻击，把敌人从一万二千公尺的高空打到一千五百公尺的低空；使王海能够从容地指挥部队，只十五分钟就打垮了敌人，并且打落三架、打伤三架敌机。他回来后，当他听到机务同志说他的飞机几天就可以修复的时候，他说：“我还要驾着这架飞机，掩护我的长机去打掉更多的敌机呢！”
    这是焦景文参加的多次激烈空战中的一次。这位英勇的僚机飞行员，不仅已经打落打伤了四架敌机，更重要的是他出色地完成了掩护长机的任务。为了表彰他的功绩，志愿军空军领导机关特授给他
    “二级战斗英雄”和“特等功臣”的光荣称号，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府颁发给他“一级战士荣誉勋章”。二晚间，我到焦景文的宿舍里去访问他。走进小屋里，我的眼光就一下子停在他床头墙壁上的那张王海的彩色画像上，我不由地想起那些看见过这情景的同志们一致的赞扬：这是一对英雄的战斗友谊的写照。
    我们一开始就谈到今天的战斗上来。我要求他谈谈：当他的飞机已经受伤，而且敌人还在不停地射击的时候，他究竟是怎样想的呢？他立刻回答说：“掩护长机安全地向敌机继续攻击，这是僚机的任务。”
    停了一会，他像是知道我还不满足于这样的回答，就又接着说：“我想你一定知道在志愿军陆军部队里有很多这样的事：当指挥员跳出掩体，冒着敌人炮火，指挥部队向敌人冲锋的时候，警卫员总是紧紧地跟在他的身旁。如果敌人的炮弹在他附近爆炸了，警卫员会一下子扑在指挥员的身上，用自己的生命来保卫他。因为他知道：指挥员关系着整个部队的胜利。我就是这样想的。
    “当然，这并不是在战斗中才想到的，从我和王海同志编到一起的那一天起，我就想到了：保证他的安全是祖国交给我的任务。因此，我就作好了准备，在任何情况下，坚决不让王海同志的飞机留下敌人的弹迹。我曾宣誓过：忠于祖国，就要忠于自己的职责；爱祖国，就要爱自己的长机。”
    这位英勇的僚机飞行员一直忠于自己的庄严誓言。
    接着他又向我谈了一次战斗。那还是一九五一年十一月十八日的事。那天，当他们出现在八架敌机眼前时，敌机立即一架跟一架地围成一个大圆圈。敌机的办法极狡猾，打头一架，就要遭受它身后一架的攻击。如果不打它，它就要投炸弹，滥炸朝鲜人民。王海看清了这一点，焦景文也看得明白；王海猛冲下去，焦景文也紧紧地跟着。果然，在王海向第一架敌机射击时，第二架敌机偷偷地昂起了机头，企图偷袭王海了。焦景文还没有等这第二架敌机的子弹出膛，就迅速地向它射出了密集的炮火，它只好按平机头退了下去。可是，第三架敌机这时也在向他开火了。情势很明显，如果他继续打第二架敌机，自己就很危险；如果他转过去和第三架敌机打对头，就可以立即制止它的疯狂的射击，并可能把它打掉；但是，更危急的情况是：王海就要遭受偷袭。这时，第三架敌机射来的子弹正在他四周掠过，但他的飞机并没有偏一度，仍然对准第二架敌机冲去，发射出一长串炮火。这架敌机让他揍下去了，王海也击落、击伤了两架敌机。
    焦景文一面说着，一面玩弄着一个小布袋。在我的记忆中，这个布袋总也没有离开过他，我好奇地问道：“这里面盛着些什么呢？”他笑着说：“你拿去看吧！”我接过来一看，原来这是中国人民赴朝慰问团赠给志愿军的小糖袋，里面却盛着一个小日记本，本子上记载着战斗情况，并画着些战斗图解。他看我对这件东西很感兴趣，就在一旁解释说：
    “上级要求我们保持双机协同作战，我们就紧密地结成一对对的双机了。可是，由于战斗中动作那么激烈，飞机速度那么快，天空又是那么广阔，两个人的动作只要有一两秒钟的差错，就可能失去目视联系。因此，我在保持双机协同作战上曾想了很多办法，首先就是熟悉王海同志的一切，哪怕是极细小的事。譬如，从极嘈杂的无线电机里我也能听出是不是他的声音。不过，最主要地还是熟悉他的思想、战术动作和特点。我把这些都记录在本子上，并且经常地捉摸着，这样，我就能更好地跟上他，像一个人一样地动作，更好地掩护他了。”
    这时，我更理解了装在慰问糖袋里的小本子的意义，它象征着这位英勇的僚机飞行员对祖国、对长机的无限热爱。就是这种崇高的爱，使他一直忠于自己的庄严誓言：“忠于祖国，就要忠于自己的职责；爱祖国，就要爱自己的长机。”（附图片）
