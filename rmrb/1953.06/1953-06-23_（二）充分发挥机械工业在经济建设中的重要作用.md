    (II) Giving Full Play to the Important Role of the Machinery Industry in Economic Construction
    The First Ministry of Machine Building of the Central People's Government issued the "Instructions on the Current Situation of State-owned Machinery Industry and the Key Points of Future Work Deployment." This instruction summarizes the basic situation of China's state-owned machinery industry over the past three years and more and the existing problems, and points out the future development direction, tasks, and methods for completing the tasks. It will play a strong guiding role in the further consolidation, reconstruction, and development of China's machinery industry.
    The machinery industry is the main department and leading enterprise for realizing national industrialization and transforming the national economy. The machine-building industry is the heart of industry, the core of heavy industry, the nerve center of industry, and the material basis for transforming the national economy's technology. Without an independent and complete machinery industry, it is impossible to achieve national industrialization, and there is no basis for national economic independence. Comrade Stalin taught us in "On the Economic Situation of the Soviet Union and the Policy of the Party": "The center of industrialization, its foundation, is the development of heavy industry (fuel, hardware, etc.), and in the final analysis, it is the development of the production of means of production, and the development of the domestic machine-building industry." In the "Summary of the First Five-Year Plan," Comrade Stalin pointed out: "What is the basic link of the Five-Year Plan? The basic link of the Five-Year Plan is heavy industry and its core, namely the machine-building industry, because only heavy industry can transform and revitalize the entire industry, transportation, and agriculture." These are also extremely valuable instructions for us.
    The foundation of China's machinery industry is very weak. The machinery industry left over from old China could basically only do mechanical repair work. Since the nationwide liberation more than three years ago, under the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government and with the help of Soviet experts, and through the efforts of all employees, the machinery industry has made significant progress. It is now able to manufacture general production equipment, such as machine tools, motors, and mining machinery, and has begun to be able to manufacture some larger and more precise equipment. However, as pointed out in the instructions of the First Ministry of Machine Building: in the organization of the entire machinery industry, there is still a lack of overall planning and proper division of labor; the production tasks of enterprises are not fixed, the variety of products is small, the specifications are not uniform, and it cannot meet the needs of all parties; the distribution of equipment is unbalanced and unreasonable, and the utilization rate is low; in terms of enterprise management, there is still a lack of a complete set of management methods and systems, so enterprises show varying degrees of confusion and waste in production; in terms of manufacturing technology, we lack experience in manufacturing large-scale, precise, and complete sets of equipment, and the quality of existing products is not high. This means that the already weak machinery industry still has a large amount of potential that has not been fully utilized. This is a major contradiction in the current machinery industry. Only by overcoming this contradiction can the existing machinery industry fully play its due role in China's first five-year plan construction. At the same time, we must also see that relying solely on the existing foundation is far from enough to meet the requirements of national economic construction for the machinery industry. Therefore, it is also necessary to carry out capital construction work in the machinery industry. Only by building several modern large enterprises that are of great significance to the machinery industry, renovating and expanding several existing enterprises, and combining this with the production reform work of existing enterprises, is it possible to completely change the face of China's machinery industry. This is an extremely glorious and serious task placed before all employees of the machinery industry. Leading cadres at all levels and all employees of the machinery industry must give full play to their initiative and creativity and strive to complete this task.
    The construction of the machinery industry must be based on existing enterprises. The accumulation of funds, the preparation of reserve forces, and the supply of equipment all rely on the full utilization of the strength of existing enterprises. At present, the leaders of some enterprises have a mentality of being fond of grandeur and novelty, and they neglect the important role of giving full play to the strength of existing enterprises. This is completely wrong. We must conduct an overall study of the existing state-owned enterprises, local state-owned factories, and newly built factories according to needs and possibilities, and gradually implement professional division of labor and coordinated production, so as to combine the reorganization, reconstruction, and new construction work of the entire machinery industry, and strive to transform and expand the machinery industry in a relatively long period of time in the future, so that it gradually becomes an independent, powerful machinery manufacturing industry that can fully meet the needs of national economic construction. At the same time, the important role of private machinery industry should also be considered at present, and its leadership must be strengthened to give play to the positive role of private machinery industry in national construction.
    In order to unleash the potential of existing enterprises and transform existing enterprises, we must vigorously strengthen our enterprise management work. In the past few years, some enterprises have done a lot of work in improving management, and have initially established a number of management systems in planning, organization, technology, etc.; however, these still cannot completely overcome the chaotic situation of enterprises. What is the reason for this? This is mainly because many of our cadres carry out various reform work in isolation, and formulate various systems in isolation, without grasping the main links. Enterprise leaders often lack in-depth research in this regard. In particular, many enterprise leaders do not have a sufficient understanding of the importance of planning management. They do not understand that the central link of this work lies in the formulation and implementation of operation plans, in order to achieve balanced production in each process. When many enterprises establish planning management systems, they do not grasp this main link, but carry out the formulation of original record systems or the establishment of various responsibility systems in isolation, and as a result, they still cannot achieve the purpose of implementing planning management. In addition, many enterprises often underestimate the complexity of transforming old enterprises, and there is a mentality of impatience and rash advance. For example, the trial production of new products often shows this problem. Many enterprises make a sample and then put it into mass production without going through a small amount of production; before mass production is certain, they stop the production of old products; and when mass production encounters difficulties, they resume the production of old products. This disrupts the entire production organization and order, causing great confusion in enterprise management, wanting to be quick but not reaching the goal, but delaying the transformation of the enterprise. These phenomena must also be overcome.
    Of course, the development of various enterprises in the current machinery industry is very uneven, and the conditions and conditions of each enterprise are very different, so the steps and methods of reform cannot be forced to be uniform. We must conduct in-depth analysis and research on the specific conditions of each enterprise itself, find out the laws of development of each enterprise itself, and then formulate a work plan that is suitable for the conditions of each enterprise, feasible, and effective. We must oppose the practice of mechanically copying formulas and mechanically applying advanced experience. Therefore, when the machinery industry enterprises implement this instruction of the First Ministry of Machine Building, they must carefully study and grasp its spirit, and in connection with the actual situation of their own enterprises, formulate specific reform measures that are in line with the conditions of each enterprise, feasible, and effective.
    The capital construction work of the machinery industry must be closely combined with the adjustment and transformation work of the original enterprises. At present, the strength of capital construction in the machinery industry, especially the design strength, is still very weak. This requires the machinery industry department to take active measures to strengthen the capital construction force. Leading cadres at all levels must attach great importance to capital construction work ideologically. Enterprises with capital construction work must have a leader specifically responsible for leading capital construction work to ensure the smooth progress of capital construction work.
    In order to ensure that the machinery industry can complete these heavy and arduous tasks, strengthening leadership is of great significance. At present, our enterprise leaders have high enthusiasm and work actively, but the level of leadership is generally not high. They only know how to assign tasks to the people below, but do not explain the policy boundaries to the cadres and workers under their jurisdiction, and do not explain the significance of the work, the direction of the work, and the methods for completing the work tasks. Therefore, in the implementation of tasks and plans, they often fail to fully mobilize the initiative and creativity of the employees under their jurisdiction, so they fail to complete the tasks; or they are eager to achieve results, so many deviations occur. This blindness and subjectivism are precisely the manifestations of bureaucracy and commandism in industrial work. The First Ministry of Machine Building requires strengthening ideological and political work in enterprises in its instructions, and points out: "The ideological and political work in enterprises should be closely centered around the central tasks of production and capital construction of enterprises, and through specific and in-depth inspection work, expose and overcome the shortcomings and mistakes in our work, so as to educate and improve the consciousness of all employees, and combine political work with economic work." These instructions are correct. It is not only suitable for the actual situation of the machinery industry, but also suitable for the situation of other industrial departments.
    We must raise our leadership level to the height of political leadership, and we must find ways to ensure that our organizational work can guarantee the realization of the party's political slogans and resolutions. This requires our leading cadres to constantly improve their leadership level, be proficient in their own business, learn to manage enterprises, and learn the correct leadership methods of combining economic work with political work and combining leadership with the masses. This is of paramount importance not only to the enterprises under the First Ministry of Machine Building, but also to all enterprises under other departments. This is a necessary prerequisite for completing the glorious tasks given by the state.

    （二）充分发挥机械工业在经济建设中的重要作用
    中央人民政府第一机械工业部发布了“关于目前国营机械工业的情况及今后工作部署要点的指示”。这个指示总结了我国国营机械工业三年多来的基本情况和目前存在的问题，指出了今后发展的方针、任务和完成任务的方法。它对我国机械工业进一步的整理、改建和发展，将起有力的指导作用。
    机械工业是实现国家工业化和改造国民经济的主要部门和主导企业。机器制造业是工业的心脏，是重工业的核心，是工业的神经中枢，是改造国民经济技术的物质基础。没有一个独立而完整的机械工业，就不可能实现国家的工业化，也就谈不到国家在经济上的独立。斯大林同志在“论苏联经济状况和党的政策”中教导我们说：“工业化底中心、它的基础，就是发展重工业（燃料、五金等等），归根到底，就是发展生产资料的生产，发展本国的机器制造业。”在“第一个五年计划的总结”中，斯大林同志指出：“五年计划的基本环节是什么呢？五年计划的基本环节，就是重工业和它的核心，即机器制造业，因为只有重工业，才能把全部工业、运输业以及农业都改造过来，振兴起来。”这些对于我们同样是极其宝贵的指示。
    我国机械工业的基础非常薄弱。旧中国遗留的机械工业，基本上只能做机械修配的工作。全国解放三年多以来，在中国共产党和人民政府正确的领导及苏联专家的帮助之下，经过全体职工的努力，机械工业有了显著的发展。它已能制造一般的生产设备，如工作母机、电机、矿山机械等，并开始能够制造一部分较大、较精密的设备。但是，正如第一机械工业部的指示中所指出的：在整个机械工业的组织上，还缺乏通盘的布置和妥善的分工；企业的生产任务还不固定，产品的品种少，规格不统一，还不能满足各方面的需要；设备的分布不平衡、不合理，利用率低；在企业管理上，还缺乏一套完整的管理方法和制度，因此各企业在生产上表现出不同程度的混乱和浪费现象；在制造技术上，我们对制造大型的、精密的、成套的设备还缺少经验，现有产品的质量也还不高。这就使得本来力量薄弱的机械工业，还存在大量的潜力未能充分发挥。这是当前机械工业的一个主要矛盾。我们只有克服这个矛盾，才能使现有的机械工业在我国第一个五年计划建设中，充分发挥其应有的作用。同时，我们更要看到，仅仅依靠现有基础，还远远不足以适应国家经济建设对机械工业的要求，因此，还必须进行机械工业的基本建设工作。只有新建若干对机械工业有重大意义的近代化大企业，改建和扩建若干现有企业，并结合现有企业的生产改革工作，才有可能彻底改变我国机械工业的面貌。这就是摆在机械工业全体职工面前的极其光荣的严重任务。机械工业部门的各级领导干部和全体职工，必须发挥高度的积极性和创造性，为完成这个任务而奋斗。
    机械工业的建设必须以现有的企业为基础。不论资金的积累、后备力量的准备、设备的供应等方面都要依靠现有企业力量的充分发挥。目前若干企业的领导者，存在着好大喜新的思想，忽视了发挥现有企业力量的重要作用。这是完全错误的。我们必须根据需要和可能，对现有的国营企业、地方国营工厂和新建的工厂，加以通盘研究，逐步实行专业分工和配合生产，使整个机械工业的改组、改建和新建工作结合起来，争取在今后一个比较长的时期内，把机械工业改造和扩大起来，使它逐渐成为一个独立的、强大的、能够充分满足国家经济建设需要的机械制造工业。同时，在目前还应该考虑到私营机械工业的重要作用，必须加强对它的领导，以发挥私营机械工业对国家建设的积极作用。
    为了发挥现有企业的潜力和改造现有企业，就必须大力加强我们的企业管理工作。过去几年来，若干企业在管理的改进上做了不少工作，在计划、组织、技术等方面也初步建立了若干管理制度；但是，这些仍然不能把企业的混乱情况完全克服。这是什么原因呢？这主要的是因为我们有许多干部孤立地进行各项改革工作，孤立地制订各种制度，而没有抓住主要的环节。企业的领导同志，常常在这方面缺少深入的钻研。特别是许多企业的领导干部，对于计划管理的重要性认识不足。他们不了解这一工作的中心环节是在于制订和贯彻作业计划，以求达到各工序的均衡生产。许多企业在建立计划管理制度时，没有抓住这主要的一环，而孤立地去进行制订原始记录制度、或孤立地去建立各种责任制，结果仍然不能达到实行计划管理的目的。此外，许多企业对改造旧企业的复杂性往往估计不足，存在着急躁、冒进情绪。例如新产品的试制工作，就往往表现了这种毛病。许多企业制成一个样品，往往不经过少量生产就投入大量生产；大量生产还没有把握，就停止了旧产品的生产；及至大量生产遇到困难，就又重新恢复旧产品的生产。这样就打乱了整个生产组织和秩序，造成企业管理上极大的混乱，欲速不达，反而延缓了企业的改造。这些现象同样是必须加以克服的。
    当然，目前机械工业的各个企业，发展很不平衡，各企业的情况和条件很不相同，因而在改革的步骤和方法上不能强求一律。我们必须深入分析研究各企业本身的具体情况，找出各企业本身的发展规律，然后才能制订适合于各企业条件的工作计划。我们必须反对硬搬公式，硬套先进经验的作法。因此，机械工业各企业在执行第一机械工业部这一指示的时候，必须认真研究和掌握它的精神，联系本企业的实际情况，订出一个切合各企业本身条件、切实可行并行之有效的具体改革措施。
    机械工业的基本建设工作必须和原有各个企业的调整、改造工作紧密结合起来。目前，机械工业基本建设的力量，特别是设计力量还十分薄弱。这就要求机械工业部门采取积极的措施，壮大基本建设力量。各级领导干部在思想上必须十分重视基本建设工作。凡有基本建设工作的企业，必须有一个领导人专责领导基本建设工作，以保证基本建设工作的顺利进行。
    为了保证机械工业能够完成这些繁重而艰巨的任务，加强领导工作是有极大意义的。目前我们的企业领导同志有高度的热情，工作积极，但是领导水平一般是不高的。他们只晓得向下面布置任务，而不向所属干部和工人群众交代政策界限，讲清工作的意义、工作的方针以及完成工作任务的方法。因此在执行任务和计划中，往往不能充分发动所属职工群众的积极性和创造性，因而完不成任务；或者是急于求成，因而发生很多偏差。这种盲目性和主观主义的作风，正是官僚主义、命令主义在工业工作中的表现形式。第一机械工业部在指示中要求加强企业中的思想工作和政治工作，并指出：“企业中思想工作和政治工作，应该密切围绕企业的生产和基本建设的中心任务而进行，通过具体深入的检查工作，揭发和克服我们工作中的毛病和错误，以此来教育和提高全体职工的觉悟，使政治工作和经济工作相结合。”这些指示都是正确的。它不仅适合于机械工业的实际情况，同时也适合于其他工业部门的情况。
    我们必须把我们的领导水准，提高到政治领导的高度上来，必须设法使我们的组织工作能保证实现党的政治口号和决议。这就要求我们的领导干部不断地提高自己的领导水平，精通自己的业务，学会管理企业，学会经济工作和政治工作相结合、领导和群众相结合的正确领导方法。这不但对于第一机械工业部所属的各企业，而且对于其他部门所属的
    一切企业，都是具有头等重要意义的。这是为完成国家给予的光荣任务所必需的前提条件。
