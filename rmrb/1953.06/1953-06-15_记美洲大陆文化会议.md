    Report on the Continental Conference of American Culture
    Chen Dingmin
    In the season when forsythia and lilac were just beginning to bloom in Prague, we left Europe by plane, crossed the South Atlantic, and after more than forty hours of continuous flight, arrived in Santiago, the capital of Chile in western Latin America. Here it was already the season of autumn winds and falling leaves, approaching the late autumn. Looking out from the city, the nearby mountain peaks were covered with snow; the crops in the suburbs had long been harvested, leaving only golden oranges, bright red persimmons, and strings of grapes hanging on the branches and trellises. Chile's fertile land grows rice, wheat, vegetables, and fresh fruits, with dense forests, large numbers of livestock, and various fish and seafood can be caught along the coast. Underground there are rich mineral deposits, making it a world-renowned producer of copper and nitrate. But today, none of this is in the hands of the people.
    American monopoly capitalists collude with a few locals to plunder Chile's wealth, exploiting the hardworking people of Chile, and living a life of extravagance and decadence in magnificent buildings. But in Santiago, tens of thousands of workers live in shacks made of branches, broken wooden crates, or rusty sheet metal, sleeping on the damp ground and threatened by hunger. In the area known locally as the "Mushroom District" in the city, there are more than 30,000 families, both men, women and children, living in slums exposed to wind and rain, living a miserable life. Unemployed people, with hunger dimming their eyes, lie on the grass in the park; beggars with long beards, leaning on wooden sticks, with empty tin cans of American-made milk powder hanging on their arms, wander the streets; unattended stray children linger and beg in front of luxurious hotels.
    Are not the people of all countries in Latin America suffering the same fate as the people of Chile today? Brazil, the world's largest producer of coffee, drinks American canned coffee powder in its cafes, and Venezuela, which produces large quantities of oil, uses Mobil's gasoline for the cars on the streets. The United Fruit Company of America controls almost all the fruits in Latin America, Pan American Airlines and American shipping companies control all transportation between Latin American countries, and even the electricity and buses used in various countries are controlled by American monopoly capitalists.
    The people of Latin American countries can no longer endure this kind of life. The tin miners in the Andes of Bolivia, the copper miners in northern Chile, the ranchers on the Argentine prairie, the agricultural laborers in the Brazilian coffee plantations, all the way to the poets of Cuba, the writers of Costa Rica, the painters of Mexico, and the nationalists of Guatemala, have issued a unified call: "We want to be the masters of our own land!"
    Although American "Coca-Cola" advertisements appear on every street and are plastered on the walls of every cafe or restaurant, the Chilean people still prefer to drink their own wine. Although American jazz music is played in every bar, the Mexican people still love their own folk songs. Spanish-language versions of American "Life" magazine and "Reader's Digest," detective novels and erotic stories, though filling the bookstores and newsstands, cannot replace novels and poems depicting the real lives of the Latin American people. What the American people love most is: Whitman, Neruda, Guillén's poems, Amado, Fallera, Howard Fast, Jack London, Dreiser, Mark Twain's novels, they also like José Venturelli, Laffont's paintings, Leopoldo Méndez's woodcuts, and even more they love to listen to Robeson's singing.
    The people of the American countries have excellent cultural traditions, they cherish their own national culture, yearn to develop their national culture and art in an atmosphere of peace and freedom, and demand direct contact between intellectuals in the American countries, and free cultural exchange between the American countries and the people of all countries in the world. To achieve this goal, cultural figures in the American countries had the intention of initiating and convening a Continental Conference of American Culture a year ago. After a wide exchange of views, at the beginning of this year, under the joint initiative of the famous Chilean poet Gabriela Mistral, the 93-year-old Colombian writer Baldomero Sanín Cano, and the Costa Rican writer and journalist Joaquín García Monge, the Continental Conference of American Culture decided to be held in Santiago, the capital of Chile, from April 26 to May 2 this year. This decision was warmly supported by cultural circles in the Americas and peace-loving people all over the world.
    Needless to say, such a conference would naturally make the American imperialists, who pursue a policy of enslaving the Americas, panic. On the one hand, they forbade prominent American cultural figures from attending the conference in Chile, and further exerted pressure on the governments of Latin American countries, especially the Chilean government, using various conspiracies of sabotage, provocation, and division to obstruct the convening of the conference; at the same time, they mobilized the radio stations, newspapers, and all propaganda tools under their control to create various rumors unfavorable to the conference, and slander the outstanding cultural figures of the Americas who participated in the preparation of the conference. Finally, they sent a special agent named Gaulkin to Chile to carry out secret activities, attempting to sabotage the convening of the conference. After arriving in Chile, this bandit claimed to convene a so-called "Free Culture Conference." This sabotage conspiracy met with a miserable failure under the contempt of Latin American cultural circles. Two days before we left Chile, the reactionary newspapers published a news item about the farce of the so-called "Free Culture Conference." The "outstanding" figure who attended this "cultural" conference was the chief of the Chilean police, and the newspaper also published a small photo of this police chief's "honorable face" filled with murderous intent.
    Friends in American cultural circles did their best to prepare for the conference under extremely difficult conditions.
    Most reactionary newspapers in Latin American countries imposed a news blackout on the conference. Chilean newspapers, unable to block the people's ears and eyes, made various distortions and slanders against the conference. The Chilean progressive daily "El Siglo," because it truthfully reported the content of the conference to the people, was forced to suspend publication for ten days by the Chilean government the day before we arrived in Santiago (April 29), and the publisher was arrested. This is American-style "cultural freedom."
    The various conspiracies of the American imperialists to sabotage the conference completely failed. Although the American imperialists stepped up their blockade, an American female singer, Betty Sanders, finally overcame various difficulties and arrived in Chile to attend the conference. Two hundred and twenty-eight representatives from Latin American countries such as Bolivia, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Cuba, Guatemala, Chile, Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, Haiti, Mexico, Uruguay, Peru, and Venezuela participated. The representatives included poets, writers, painters, sculptors, actors, dancers, musicians, film workers, professors, social workers, economists, scientists, architects, engineers, doctors, and journalists, representing various political views and religious beliefs.
    On April 26, this historically significant first gathering of American cultural figures was solemnly opened at the most magnificent Municipal Theatre in Santiago. All the seats upstairs and downstairs in the theater were completely full. Professor Maldonado, chairman of the conference and head of the Chilean delegation, Dean of the Faculty of Architecture of the University of Chile, read out congratulatory messages from cultural figures all over the world. The congratulatory messages from Guo Moruo, Chairman of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, and the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, were warmly welcomed by the audience with applause.
    The conference solemnly announced three agenda items: how to promote the free development of culture in the American countries, how to preserve the national cultural characteristics of the countries; and how to expand cultural exchanges between the countries. Meetings were held three times a day, and whether in the general meeting or in the group meetings, representatives from various countries actively spoke, either on the scope of their own country, the scope of the Americas, or from the perspective of the entire world, and some representatives even spoke on the scope of their own profession, unanimously condemning American cultural aggression, demanding the preservation of national cultures, and pointing out the importance of free cultural exchange between countries.
    After seven days of heated discussions, the conference adopted four historic documents: 1. Message to the American cultural circles and the American people; 2. Invitation to cultural figures from the five major countries, the United States, the Soviet Union, China, Britain, and France, to meet with cultural figures from the Americas in Latin America; 3. Message to cultural circles in the American countries; 4. Message to governments, cultural organizations, and intellectuals in the American countries.
    At the beginning of the conference, the moving speech by the guest from Europe, the famous Polish poet Iwaszkiewicz, won warm applause. Because of visa issues and the long journey, the Chinese delegation did not arrive in Chile until April 30. They participated in the conference on the same day and received a great welcome, which also gave the conference and cultural figures in Latin America great encouragement. Comrade Li Yimang's speech at the conference was repeatedly interrupted by warm applause. After the speech, the audience stood up and cheered and applauded.
    On May 3, the conference held its closing ceremony. The five floors of the theater were full, and many listeners from various places were standing in the aisles and outside the doors. When the Chinese delegation stepped onto the rostrum, everyone stood up and applauded warmly, and the sound of "Long live the People's Republic of China" in Spanish was endless among the crowd.
    The great achievement of this Continental Conference of American Culture is a major victory for the forces of world peace on the cultural front. This conference made many people in the American cultural circles realize that only peace can guarantee the free development of culture in various countries. Through this conference, many cultural figures from the American countries have become active participants and supporters of the peace movement. The resolution specifically proposed inviting cultural figures from the five major countries to meet with cultural figures from Latin America, which is a concrete step to promote the five major governments to discuss and sign a five-power peace pact. The resolution also pointed out that in order to preserve national culture and free cultural exchange between countries, it is necessary to strive for national independence. This was also one of the most heatedly discussed issues at the conference. After this conference, many American cultural figures recognized the harm of the cultural aggression of so-called "cosmopolitanism," and finally put forward a solemn demand: to defend the living rights of intellectuals.
    Through this conference, American cultural figures have become more united, forming a solid front from the past scattered forces. They not only demand free direct contact between the American countries, but also want to exchange with cultural circles in all countries of the world, learn from each other's experiences, enrich and develop the national cultures of various countries, and achieve the goal of serving the world's culture for peace.

    记美洲大陆文化会议
    陈定民
    在布拉格的迎春花和丁香花初放的季节，我们乘飞机离开了欧洲，横渡南大西洋，连续飞行四十余小时之后，到达了拉丁美洲西部的智利首都——圣地亚哥。这里已是秋风萧萧，落叶满地，接近残秋的时令了。从市内远望，附近山顶上更是白雪皑皑；近郊的庄稼早已收获，只剩下黄澄澄的橘子，红艳的柿子和一串串的葡萄还挂在树枝和架子上。智利丰饶的土地上，生长着稻、麦、蔬菜和鲜果，有浓密的森林，大量的牲畜，沿海可以捕获各种鱼类和海鲜，地下有丰富的矿产，这是世界上著名产铜和硝石的国家。但是如今这一切都不在人民的手里。
    美国垄断资本家勾结当地少数人搜刮智利的财富，剥削着智利勤苦的劳动人民，在巍峨的大厦中，过着骄奢淫逸、醉生梦死的生活。可是就在圣地亚哥，成千成万的劳动者却住在用树枝、破木箱拆下来的木板，或锈烂的洋铁皮搭成的陋室中，睡在潮湿的地上，受着饥饿的威胁。市内被当地人称为“蘑菇区”的地方，就有三万多家男女老幼住在风吹雨打、朝不保夕的贫民窟中，过着凄惨的生活。饿得两眼无神的失业者躺在公园的草地上；满面长须、手里拄着木棍、臂上挂着美制奶粉的洋铁空罐的乞丐在街头徜徉；无人照顾的流浪孩子们在华丽的旅舍门前徘徊行乞。
    今天整个拉丁美洲所有国家的人民，不是都像智利人民一样遭受着同样的厄运吗？全世界生产咖啡最多的巴西，咖啡馆里喝的却是美国罐头的咖啡粉，出产大量石油的委内瑞拉，街上行驶的汽车却要用美孚公司的汽油。美国联合水果公司控制了整个拉丁美洲几乎全部的水果，泛美航空公司和美国轮船公司掌握了整个拉丁美洲各国之间的交通，甚至于各国国内用电和公共汽车都控制在美国垄断资本家的手里。
    拉丁美洲各国的人民不能再忍受这种生活了。玻利维亚的安底斯山上的锡矿工人，智利北部的铜矿工人，阿根廷草原上的畜牧者，巴西咖啡园的农业劳动者，一直到古巴的诗人，哥斯达里加的作家，墨西哥的画家，危地马拉的民族主义者，发出了一致的呼声：“我们要做自己土地上的主人！”
    尽管美国“可口可乐”的广告在每一条街上出现，在每一家咖啡馆或饭馆的墙上贴着，智利人民还是喜欢喝自己出产的葡萄酒。尽管每一个酒吧间奏着美国的爵士音乐，墨西哥的人民还是热爱自己的民间情歌。西班牙文版的美国“生活”杂志和“读者文摘”、侦探小说和色情故事，虽然摆满了书肆和报摊，但它们代替不了描写拉丁美洲人民现实生活的小说与诗篇。美洲人民最热爱的是：惠特曼、聂鲁达、纪廉（前译“吉里安”——编者）的诗，亚马多、法勒拉、霍华德·法斯特、杰克·伦敦、德来塞、马克·吐温的小说，他们还喜欢何塞·万徒勒里、拉芬脱的图画，来阿波多·孟代士的木刻，更爱听罗伯逊的歌唱。
    美洲各国人民具有优秀的文化传统，他们珍爱着自己的民族文化，渴望在和平与自由的空气中发展自己的民族文化与艺术，并要求美洲各国知识分子之间取得直接联系，美洲与全世界各国人民之间获得文化的自由交流。为了实现这种目标，在一年之前，美洲文化界人士就有了发起召集美洲大陆文化会议的意图。经过广泛地交换意见之后，今年年初，在智利名诗人加波里尔、密斯特拉夫人，哥伦比亚九十三岁高龄的作家巴多米洛、萨宁·卡诺和哥斯达黎加的作家兼新闻记者豪金·卡尔夏·孟赫的联名发起下，美洲大陆文化会议决定于今年四月二十六日至五月二日在智利首都圣地亚哥举行。这个决定，受到了美洲文化界以至全世界爱好和平的人民的热烈支持。
    不消说，这样的会议自然要使奉行奴化美洲政策的美帝国主义者感到惊惶失措。他们一方面禁止美国著名文化界人士在智利参加会议，更对拉丁美洲各国政府，尤其是对智利政府施以压力，用种种破坏、挑衅、分化的阴谋诡计，阻碍大会召开；同时又发动控制在他们手里的电台、报纸和一切宣传工具，制造种种不利大会的谣言，诬蔑参加大会筹备工作的美洲杰出的文化界人士。最后更派了一个名叫高耳金的特务到智利进行秘密活动，企图破坏大会的召开。这个匪徒在到达智利之后，声称要召开一个所谓“自由文化会议”。这个破坏阴谋在拉丁美洲文化界的唾弃下遭到了悲惨的失败。在我们离开智利的前两天，反动报纸上刊登了一段所谓“自由文化会议”丑剧的新闻，出席这个“文化”会议的 “卓越”人物是智利警察局长，报纸上还登载了一张满面杀气的这位警察局长“尊容”的小照。
    美洲文化界的朋友们在极端困难的条件下，尽了最大的努力进行大会的筹备工作。
    拉丁美洲各国大多数反动报纸对大会的消息实行封锁。智利报纸无法封闭人民的耳目，就做出种种歪曲宣传，对大会加以诬蔑。智利进步的日报“世纪报”，因为真实地向人民报道会议内容，在我们到达圣地亚哥的前一天（四月二十九日），智利政府竟强迫它停刊十日，并把发行人逮捕起来。这就是美国式的“文化自由”。
    美帝国主义破坏大会的种种阴谋是完全失败了。虽然美帝国主义者加紧封锁，一位美国女歌唱家培蒂·桑黛尔终于克服种种困难，抵达智利出席了大会。拉丁美洲有玻利维亚、哥伦比亚、哥斯达黎加、厄瓜多尔、古巴、危地马拉、智利、阿根廷、巴西、巴拉圭、海地、墨西哥、乌拉圭、秘鲁、委内瑞拉等国家的二百二十八人参加。代表中有诗人、作家、画家、雕刻家、演员、舞蹈家、音乐家、电影工作者、教授、社会工作者、经济学家、科学家、建筑师、工程师、医生、新闻记者，代表着各种不同的政治见解与宗教信仰。
    四月二十六日，这个具有历史意义的美洲文化界人士第一次大集会在圣地亚哥最富丽堂皇的市立剧院举行了隆重的开幕式。大剧院所有楼上下座位完全坐满。大会主席智利代表团团长、智利大学建筑学院院长马尔多内斯教授宣读来自全世界各地文化界人士的贺电。中国人民保卫世界和平委员会郭沫若主席和中华全国文学艺术界联合会的贺电，获得全场热烈欢迎的掌声。
    大会上庄严地宣布了三项议程：如何促进美洲各国文化的自由发展，如何保存各国民族文化特性；以及如何扩大各国间文化交流。每天开会三次，无论在大会上或小组会上，各国代表都踊跃发言，或就本国范围、美洲范围，或从整个世界的情况，若干代表更就其本身职业范围发言，一致严厉申斥美国的文化侵略，要求保存各国民族文化，并指出各国文化自由交流的重要性。
    经过七天热烈的讨论，大会通过了具有历史性的四个文件：一、告美洲文化界及美洲人民书；二、邀请美、苏、中、英、法五大国文化界人士来拉丁美洲与美洲文化界人士会晤书；三、告美洲各国文化界书；四、告美洲各国政府、各国文化组织及知识分子书。
    在会议开始时，从欧洲来的来宾、波兰著名诗人伊瓦希凯维奇的动人的演辞，博得了热烈的掌声。中国代表团因为签证关系，路程遥远，迟至四月三十日才赶到智利，当天就参加了大会，受到极大的欢迎，也给予大会和拉丁美洲文化界人士很大的鼓舞。李一氓同志在大会上的发言屡次为热烈的掌声打断。发言完毕，全场起立欢呼鼓掌。
    五月三日大会举行闭幕式，戏院五层楼的座位都坐满了，过道及门外还站着许多各地来的旁听者。当中国代表团登上主席台时，全体起立热烈鼓掌，群众中用西班牙语高呼“中华人民共和国万岁”之声不绝。
    这次美洲大陆文化会议的伟大成就，是世界和平力量在文化战线上的一大胜利。这次大会使美洲文化界许多人士认识到只有和平才能保证各国文化的自由发展。通过这次会议，美洲各国的许多文化界人士成为和平运动的积极参加者和拥护者。在决议案中特别提出邀请五大国文化界人士与拉丁美洲文化界会晤，这是促进五大国政府商谈并签订五大国和平公约的一个具体步骤。决议案中并指出：为了保存民族文化及各国之间自由的文化交流，必须争取民族独立。这也是会议中讨论最热烈的一个问题。经过这次会议之后，许多美洲文化界人士认识了所谓“世界主义”的文化侵略的危害性，最后提出了严正的要求：保卫知识分子的生活权利。
    经过这一次会议，美洲文化界人士已更加团结起来，从过去分散的力量结成为一个坚固的阵线。他们不仅要求在美洲各国之间自由的直接联系，而且要与全世界各国文化界交流，互相汲取经验，丰富并发展各国的民族文化，达到全世界文化为和平服务的目的。
