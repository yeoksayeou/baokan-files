    Xinhua News Agency, Montevideo, 30th: The harsh lives of Brazilian working people tragically affect the lives of children. The infant mortality rate and the number of homeless and out-of-school children are constantly increasing.
    "People's Daily" said: Eighty percent of the causes of child deaths are due to malnutrition and poor living conditions. Recife, the central city of Pernambuco State, which is called a "children's graveyard," saw 50,000 children die before the age of one from 1942 to 1952.
    The famous Brazilian social leader, Dr. Conrad Walterloo, pointed out that only children in Johannesburg, Union of South Africa, live in such poverty as in Recife.
    The problem of homeless children is gradually becoming a national disaster in Brazil. There are 100,000 homeless children in São Paulo, and the same number in Rio de Janeiro.
    Homelessness causes child crime. "World News" said: "Most of the crimes committed by homeless children are theft and some immoral acts."
    Many Brazilian children do not have the opportunity to study. According to "People's Daily," among the six million children aged 10 to 14, only 300,000 can study in secondary schools.

    巴西儿童过着悲惨和贫困的生活
    【新华社讯】据塔斯社蒙得维的亚三十日讯：巴西劳动人民的艰苦生活悲惨地影响着儿童们的生活情况。儿童的死亡率、无家可归的儿童和失学儿童的人数都在不断增加。
    “人民报”说：儿童致死的原因百分之八十是由于营养不良和居住条件恶劣。被人们叫做“儿童坟场”的伯南布哥州中心城市累西腓，从一九四二年至一九五二年有五万儿童不到一岁就死了。
    巴西著名的社会领袖康拉德·华特卢医生指出：只有南非联邦约翰内斯堡的儿童，才生活在像累西腓这样贫困的情况里。
    儿童无家可归的问题正逐渐成为巴西一个全国性的灾难问题。在圣保罗有十万名无家可归的儿童，在里约热内卢也有同样的数目。
    无家可归造成了儿童的犯罪。“世界报”说：“无家可归的儿童所犯的罪，大多数是偷窃和一些不道德的行为。”
    很多巴西儿童没有读书的机会。据“人民报”说：在六百万名十至十四岁的儿童当中，只有三十万名能在中等学校念书。
