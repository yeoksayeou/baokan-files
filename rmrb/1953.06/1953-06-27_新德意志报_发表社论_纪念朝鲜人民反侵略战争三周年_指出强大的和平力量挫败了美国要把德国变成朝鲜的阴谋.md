Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, June 26th: The "Neues Deutschland" published an editorial on the 25th commemorating the third anniversary of the Korean War. The editorial said: "Three years of brutal war with napalm bombs and germ bombs have not subdued the Korean people. On the contrary, it has proven that a people fighting for national independence, and supported by peace-loving and freedom-loving people all over the world, are invincible."

The editorial continued: "Korea has become the graveyard of the American imperialists' dream of dominating the world. With the help of their Chinese brothers, the Korean people shattered the myth of so-called American invincibility. The American attempt to conquer the people of Asia has failed."

The editorial also stated: "Because of the Korean War, American war instigators are becoming more and more isolated, and the forces of peace are becoming stronger and stronger day by day.

"Therefore, the American ruling clique's attempt to launch a world war through the Korean War has also been thwarted. The unwavering peace policy pursued by the Soviet Union and People's China, as well as the growing strength of the world peace camp, have crushed the American plan to expand the war. It is these forces of peace that have forced the American imperialists to finally admit the failure of their Korean adventure and consider ending the war."

The "Neues Deutschland" editorial compared the Korean War with the recent fascist provocations in Berlin. The editorial said: "The events in the German Democratic Republic on June 17th clearly demonstrate to the world that the provocations of the American warmongers have the same purpose as the conspiracy that began on June 25, 1950...

"However, the course of events in Germany is different from what happened in Korea three years ago. Here, Soviet troops are stationed. The United States has become isolated, exposed, and hated by all mankind. Moreover, due to the important impact of the Korean War, the forces of peace have grown incomparably stronger in the past three years."

The editorial concluded: "Therefore, the attempt to turn Germany and Europe into another Korea has been thwarted. But the threat of war provocation still exists. The peace and security of the German people and Europe are still not solid. Spies and provocateurs must be severely punished so that they cannot cause disruption. Only in this way can the preconditions be created for a peacefully reunited Germany on a democratic basis..."

    “新德意志报”发表社论
    纪念朝鲜人民反侵略战争三周年
    指出强大的和平力量挫败了美国要把德国变成朝鲜的阴谋
    【新华社柏林二十六日电】“新德意志报”二十五日发表社论纪念朝鲜战争三周年。社论说：“用凝固汽油弹和细菌弹进行的三年残酷的战争并不能使朝鲜人民屈服。它倒证明了，为民族独立而斗争、并得到了全世界爱好和平与自由的人类的声援的人民是不可战胜的。”
    社论接着说：“朝鲜已经成为美帝国主义者称霸世界的梦想的坟墓。朝鲜人民在中国兄弟的援助下，粉碎了所谓美国不可战胜的神话。美国人想征服亚洲人民的企图失败了。”
    社论又说：“由于朝鲜战争，美国战争挑拨者一天比一天孤立，和平力量一天比一天强大。
    “所以，美国统治集团想通过朝鲜战争发动世界大战的企图也遭到了失败，苏联、人民中国所奉行的不可动摇的和平政策以及不断增长的世界和平阵营力量粉碎了美国扩大战争的计划。就是这些和平力量迫使美帝国主义者最后承认朝鲜冒险举动的失败并考虑结束战争。”
    “新德意志报”社论把朝鲜战争和最近柏林发生的法西斯挑拨行为加以比较。社论说：“六月十七日，在德意志民主共和国发生的事件向世界十分清楚地说明了，美国战争贩子的挑拨行为和一九五○年六月二十五日开始的阴谋有着同样的目的……
    “但是，在德国发生的事件的过程与三年前朝鲜发生的情况不同。这里有苏军留驻。美国已陷于孤立，受到揭发并被全人类所憎恨。而且由于朝鲜战争的重要影响，和平力量在过去三年中已无比地壮大。”
    社论最后说：“所以要想把德国和欧洲变成朝鲜的企图受到了阻碍。但是战争挑拨的威胁仍然存在。德国人民和欧洲的和平与安全仍不巩固。特务和挑拨者必须加以严惩，使他们不能起破坏作用，这样，才能为了在民主基础上和平地重新统一的德国创造先决条件……”
