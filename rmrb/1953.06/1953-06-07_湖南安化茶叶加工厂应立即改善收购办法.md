    Hunan Anhua Tea Processing Plant Should Immediately Improve Procurement Methods
    Letter from Lin Liwo and Huang Shaodan, Anhua County People's Government, Hunan: Our county is a tea-producing area. Since liberation, a tea processing plant has been established here, which has greatly improved the lives of the people of Anhua. However, the plant has serious shortcomings in its tea procurement work, which has a great impact on farmers' production. The situation is as follows:
    First, the procurement procedures are too complicated. When the tea factory entrusts the county cooperative to purchase tea, it emphasizes the implementation of the so-called "dual-track system" evaluation method, which means that no matter how much tea a tea farmer has, it must be brewed for testing, and then the tea price is obtained by scoring the internal quality and external shape separately. Tea is divided into five grades and fourteen classes, with a total of 1,250 tea prices. If the special grade tea price is included, there are more than 2,000 kinds. Therefore, the procurement time is prolonged. For example, on April 27, when the tea factory purchased black tea in Mapei City, it only evaluated one tray of tea in two hours. More than a dozen tea farmers from Jiaoyuan Township in the Second District, such as Chen Changxiang and Xiong Jianke, traveled more than 50 miles to the Dongping purchasing station to sell tea, and waited for three full days without selling it. They complained and said: "We have been waiting for three days, and we have not received a license yet. I don't know how long it will take to sell it. If we don't sell it, we won't have food to eat; if we sell it, the time is too uneconomical. Now is the time of 'one day of spring plowing, ten days of grain', what should I do?" Because they waited for a long time and could not sell their tea, some tea farmers did not have money to buy food. One tea farmer was so angry that he threw all the tea into the Zi River. The Finance Committee of Anhua County once suggested abolishing the "dual-track system" evaluation method for third and fourth grade tea in order to simplify the procurement procedures; however, the person in charge of the Anhua Tea Factory said: "The dual-track system is formulated by the Provincial Tea Company. If it is not implemented, who will be responsible if the tea is purchased badly in the future?" Now that the rice transplanting season in rural areas has arrived, tea farmers urgently need to sell tea to buy rice. If the tea procurement problem is not resolved immediately, spring plowing production will be severely affected.
    Secondly, the Anhua Tea Factory unilaterally emphasizes that tea should pay attention to quality and stipulates that out-of-grade tea will not be purchased. The factory requires tea farmers to use the cold fermentation method to make black tea, but they do not provide technical guidance, so the rejection rate reaches 40%. For example, the Dongping purchasing station evaluated more than 100 pieces of tea, of which more than 60 pieces were rejected because they did not meet the specifications. This situation is very common, so tea farmers suffer great losses.
    Third, the masses generally report that the tea price is too low. According to the survey by the County Cooperative General Office on the cost of tea planting by farmer Huang Zihui in Shatian Township, Fifth District, the cost of black tea from picking to drying is 536,000 yuan per dan, while this year's purchase price for first-grade black tea is only 630,000 yuan. If the costs of opening and cultivating the garden, winter plowing and fertilization, multiple rounds of manual labor, drying, and selling tea are all included, then there is no profit to be made. The price of black tea is the same. The cost of first-grade tea is 1.22 million yuan per dan, but this year's purchase price is only 1.28 million yuan. This seriously affects the farmers' production enthusiasm. Deng Hanlin, a poor farmer in Chanxikou Township, Thirteenth District, said: "I won't pick my tea anymore, it's more cost-effective to help others do odd jobs."
    Because of the above-mentioned serious shortcomings in the tea procurement work of the factory, the spring plowing production work in our county has suffered many difficulties. It is recommended that relevant departments quickly study and solve this problem.

### 湖南安化茶叶加工厂应立即改善收购办法

专栏：读者来信摘要

    湖南安化茶叶加工厂应立即改善收购办法
    湖南安化县人民政府林里卧、黄邵丹同志来信：我县是一个产茶区。解放后，这里设立了茶叶加工厂，对安化人民的生活改善起了很大的作用。但该厂在茶叶收购工作上存在着严重的缺点，对农民的生产影响很大。现将情况介绍如下：
    一、收购手续太繁杂。茶厂委托县合作社收购茶叶时，强调执行所谓“双轨制”的评价办法，就是说，茶农的茶不论多少，都要经过泡水化验，再按内质外形分别计分而得出茶价。茶叶分为五级十四等，共有茶价一千二百五十种，如果把特级茶价计算在内，就有两千多种。因此，拖长了收购的时间。例如，四月二十七日，茶厂在马辔市收购红茶时，两个钟头只评了一盘茶。二区椒园乡茶农谌昌祥、熊健科等十多人，从五十多里路的地方到东坪收购站卖茶，等了整整三天，还没卖掉。他们埋怨地说：“等了三天，还没有领到牌子，不晓得要多久才能卖脱。不卖吗？又没有饭吃；卖吧，时间太划不来了。现在正是‘一日春耕，十日粮’的时候，叫我怎么办呢？”因为等久了卖不掉茶，有的茶农没有钱买饭吃。有一个茶农气得把茶叶都丢到资江河里去了。安化县财委会曾经建议三、四级茶取销“双轨制”的评茶办法，以简化收购手续；但安化茶厂的负责人却说：“双轨制是省茶叶公司制定的，如果不执行，将来茶收坏了，由谁负责？”现在农村插秧时节已经到来，茶农迫切需要卖茶换米吃，如果茶叶收购问题不立即解决，春耕生产将受到严重影响。
    其次是安化茶厂片面强调茶叶要注意品质，规定级外茶不收。该厂要茶农用冷发酵的办法制红茶，而他们又不加以技术的指导，因此拒收率达到百分之四十。如东坪收购站评了一百多件茶，其中有六十多件不合规格而拒收。这种情况很普遍，因此茶农所受损失很大。
    第三，群众普遍反映茶价太低。根据县合作总社在五区调查沙田乡农民黄祖惠植茶成本的结果，一级黑茶自采摘至干燥，每担成本要五十三万六千元，而今年一级黑茶收价只有六十三万元。如果把开园育园、冬耕施肥、复脚工、炕工、卖茶工一齐计算进去，那就无利可图了。红茶的价格也是一样，一级茶成本费要一百二十二万元一担，但今年收价只有一百二十八万元。这就严重地影响了茶农生产情绪。十三区潺溪口乡贫农邓汉林说：“我的茶不摘了，帮别人去打零工还要划得来些。”
    由于该厂在茶叶收购工作中存在着上述严重缺点，使我县春耕生产工作遭受了许多困难。建议有关部门迅速研究并解决这个问题。
