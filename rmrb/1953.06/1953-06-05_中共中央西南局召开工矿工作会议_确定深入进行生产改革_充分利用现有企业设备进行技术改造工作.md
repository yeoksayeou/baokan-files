Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, June 4th: The Southwest Bureau of the CPC Central Committee held its second work conference on industry and mining from May 14th to 18th. This conference focused on reviewing the progress of production reforms in factories and mines in various provinces and cities, summarizing and exchanging experiences, and studying issues related to basic construction, local industry, and handicrafts.

The conference believes that since the first work conference on industry and mining held by the Southwest Bureau of the CPC Central Committee last November, most leading cadres in factories and mines have changed their work styles, deeply led production, discovered and resolved many key problems, and overcome serious confusion in enterprise management. After March this year, the masses were mobilized to discuss and conscientiously implement the state production plan, so the production plans for April in most factories and mines were completed relatively well, and product quality also improved. At present, most factories and mines have entered the stage of combining self-examination by the masses, conducting detailed investigation and fixing, and formulating average advanced quotas; a few factories and mines, because they already had various preliminary quotas in the past, are now checking and revising them, and beginning to gradually establish planned management.

The conference pointed out that although many achievements have been made in the past stage, the phenomenon of production management lagging behind production requirements still exists. The original records of many factories and mines are not thorough; there are still phenomena such as erratic execution of state plans; the phenomena of arbitrarily working overtime and ignoring product quality and labor protection are also relatively serious. Therefore, in the future, all factories and mines must conscientiously implement the instructions of the Southwest Bureau of the CPC Central Committee to "continue to deepen production reform, do a good job in quota setting, establish planned management, and complete the state plan on schedule." In the entire process of production reform, we should fully mobilize the masses, seriously discuss the plan, continuously discover and solve key problems hindering production, tap production potential, systematically promote rationalization proposals and advanced experiences, gradually realize planned management, and achieve the goal of completing and overfulfilling the state plan.

After studying the situation of basic construction in the entire region, the conference pointed out that all localities should correct the unrealistic phenomena of demanding too much and planning too large in the future. This year, basic construction in the Southwest region is mainly expansion and repair, with few new construction projects, and it is necessary to attach importance to the utilization and technical transformation of existing enterprise equipment. Civil engineering, construction, and industrial and mining departments should vigorously promote the parallel flow operation construction method, overcome the blindness and confusion in construction, and strengthen the organization and design of construction work. Special attention should be paid to geological work.

The conference studied the operating principles of local industry and handicrafts, and believes that local industry and handicrafts are extremely important to the national economy and the people's livelihood. All provinces and cities should attach importance to them, quickly strengthen the leadership of this work, and start to solve the urgent problems that need to be solved.

Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, June 2nd: The reconstruction and expansion projects of most state-owned factories and mines in the Southwest region are being carried out vigorously. This is one of the important contents of basic construction in the Southwest region this year. The reconstruction project of the main coal mine roadways in the Southwest region has already started, and mechanical equipment such as ventilators, air compressors, and motors are currently being installed intensively. The reconstruction project of the iron and steel system has entered a tense stage and is expected to be completed in the third quarter. All cotton mills will complete the installation of broken-end cotton suction machines this year, and the installation of ventilation and cooling equipment will be completed before the end of June. The reconstruction of the factory buildings of each factory is also being carried out actively. The automatic cloth weaving factory after the expansion can be put into production this year, the expansion of the textile machinery factory can complete the civil construction project in the third quarter of this year, and the expansion of the printing and dyeing factory is also being intensively designed and is scheduled to start construction in the fourth quarter of this year.

Many factories and mines in the Southwest region attach great importance to fully leveraging the utilization rate of old industrial equipment and improving the working conditions of workers in the reconstruction and expansion projects. This year, the investment in the reconstruction and expansion projects of state-owned factories and mines in the Southwest region accounts for about 70% of the state investment in industrial construction in the Southwest region. After the reconstruction and expansion of these state-owned factories and mines, production efficiency will be greatly improved. After all cotton mills complete the installation of broken-end cotton suction machines, because the fly waste is reduced and the work is easier to do, the unit output of spindles can be increased to the standard of 1.2 pounds stipulated by the Textile Industry Department of the Central People's Government. After the completion of the reconstruction project of the mines under the Southwest Coal Mine Administration in 1953, the output can be increased by one to two times. After the completion of this year's expansion project of the Chongqing Iron and Steel Industrial System, the output of steel ingots can be increased by about one and a half times, and new varieties of high-quality steel will be produced.

Improving the working conditions of workers is also an important purpose of the reconstruction project of various factories and mines in the Southwest region this year. The rail straightening work of Steel Plant 101, except for the straightening part, will be changed from manual operation to machine operation, which will greatly save labor and improve working conditions. After the completion of the reconstruction project of the coal mine system, the backward state of manual coal mining and manual transportation will be changed, and the mechanization of coal mining and underground transportation will be gradually achieved. After the completion of the roadway reconstruction project of Coal Mine 401, which has already started, underground electric trains will appear in the coal mines in the Southwest region. The factory buildings of the cotton spinning system in the Southwest region were originally particularly simple, and most of them were bamboo and rattan-bundled frames, which will be systematically reconstructed in the future. For example, Textile Machinery Factory 614 is also building a new factory building. Yarn Factory 610 will replace 9,800 square meters of roofing in July and August this year, add a heat-resistant layer and change the cement floor to a wooden floor. The phenomenon that female workers suffered from arthritis due to the dampness on the cement floor in the past can be eliminated.

    中共中央西南局召开工矿工作会议
    确定深入进行生产改革
    充分利用现有企业设备进行技术改造工作
    【新华社重庆四日电】中共中央西南局在五月十四日至十八日召开了第二次工矿工作会议。这次会议着重检查了各省市工厂、矿山生产改革的进行情况，总结和交流了经验，并研究了基本建设、地方工业和手工业等方面的问题。
    会议认为：自去年十一月中共中央西南局第一次工矿工作会议以来，各工厂、矿山的领导干部多数已转变作风，深入领导生产，发现与解决了不少关键问题，克服了企业管理中的严重混乱现象。今年三月以后，又发动群众讨论和认真执行国家生产计划，因而大部分工厂、矿山四月份的生产计划都完成得比较好，产品质量也有了进步。目前多数工厂、矿山已进入结合群众自查，进行细查细定，制定平均先进定额的阶段；少数工厂、矿山因过去已有各项初步定额，正在加以检查和修订，开始逐步地建立计划管理。
    会议指出：虽然过去这一阶段已做出不少成绩，但生产管理落后于生产要求的现象依然存在。不少工厂、矿山的原始记录作得不彻底；执行国家计划仍有忽高忽低等现象；随便加班加点、忽视产品质量和劳动保护的现象，也较严重。因此，今后各厂矿必须认真贯彻中共中央西南局“继续深入生产改革，作好定额工作，建立计划管理，按期完成国家计划”的指示。在生产改革全部过程中，应充分发动群众，认真讨论计划，不断发掘与解决障碍生产的关键问题，挖掘生产潜力，有计划地推广合理化建议和先进经验，逐步实现计划管理，达到完成和超额完成国家计划的目的。
    会议研究了全区基本建设的情况之后，指出各地今后应纠正要求多、计划大等不切合实际的现象。今年西南区基本建设主要是扩建、修补，新建工程不多，必须重视现有企业设备的利用和技术改造工作。土木、建筑、工矿等部门今后应大力推行平行流水作业施工法，克服施工的盲目、混乱现象，加强施工的组织、设计工作。对于地质工作，尤应予以重视。
    会议研究了地方工业和手工业经营的方针，认为地方工业与手工业关系国计民生极为重大，各省市应引起重视，迅速加强这一工作的领导，着手解决其中亟需解决的问题。
    【新华社重庆二日电】西南区大部国营工厂、矿山的改建和扩建工程正在大力进行，这是西南区今年基本建设的重要内容之一。今年西南区主要煤矿的井巷改建工程已经开始，目前正在紧张地安装抽风机、压风机、电动机等机械。钢铁系统的改建工程已进入紧张阶段，准备在第三季度完工。各棉纺厂今年要完成断头吸棉机的装置工作，六月底以前要完成通风降温设备的装置，各厂的厂房改建工程也正在积极进行。经过扩建的自动布机布厂今年可以投入生产，扩建的纺织机械厂今年第三季度可以完成土木建筑工程，扩建的印染厂也正在加紧设计，准备在今年第四季度开工。
    西南区许多工厂、矿山在改建和扩建工程中，很重视充分发挥旧有工业的设备利用率和改善工人的劳动条件。今年西南区国营厂矿的改建和扩建工程的投资，占西南区工业建设国家投资的百分之七十左右。这些国营工厂和矿山经过改建和扩建以后，生产效率都将大大提高。各棉纺厂完成断头吸棉机装置以后，因为飞花减少，工作好做，纱锭的单位产量可以提高到中央人民政府纺织工业部规定的一点二磅的标准。西南煤矿管理局所属各矿一九五三年的改建工程完工以后，产量可以提高一倍到二倍。重庆钢铁工业系统今年的扩建工程完工以后，钢锭产量约可提高一倍半，并将生产新品种的优级钢材。
    改善工人的劳动条件也是西南区各工厂、矿山今年改建工程的重要目的。一零一钢铁厂钢轨整理工作除了压直部分外，都将从手工操作改为机器操作，这样就大大节省了劳动力，改善了劳动条件。煤矿系统的改建工程完成后，将改变手工采煤和人力运输的落后状态，逐步做到采煤和井下运输的机械化。现已开始的四零一煤矿井巷改建工程完工后，在西南区的煤矿中将出现井下电车。西南区棉纺系统的厂房建筑原来特别简陋，大部分是竹篾捆扎的房架，今后将系统地进行改建。像六一四纺织机械厂还在另建新厂房。六一零纱厂在今年七、八月间将更换九千八百平方公尺的屋面，添置防热层并改水泥地为地板。过去女工因受水泥地上潮气的影响而患关节炎的现象可以消除。
