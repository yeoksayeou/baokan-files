Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 11th: The American spy organization "Cannon Agency" in Japan, directly under the command of the Central Intelligence Agency in Washington, is carrying out conspiracy activities against the people of Japan, China, and the Soviet Union.

The so-called "Cannon Agency" has become notorious for its exposure of the secret kidnapping of Japanese writer Wataru Kajichi. This spy agency is named after its head, American Lieutenant Colonel Cannon. The "Cannon Agency" has a large organization, owning more than one hundred fishing boats, thirty or so "aquatic products companies" and "trading companies," and dozens of officials, journalists, industrialists, engineers, and gang leaders. They are all under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Cannon, carrying out various evil deeds.

The "Cannon Agency" constantly carries out activities to split and undermine the Japanese people's movement for national independence. It uses Japanese national traitors Sadaaki Nabeyama, Hiroshi Sano, Kiyoharu Tanaka, Kiichi Minami, etc., to carry out activities to "disintegrate" the democratic national united front and collect anti-communist intelligence, and attempts to send people into the Japanese Communist Party to carry out espionage activities. The "Cannon Agency" also directly controls the Yoshida government's spy organization, the "Cabinet Investigation Office." The head of the "Cabinet Investigation Office," Jun Murai, reports to the "Cannon Agency" every three days.

The "Cannon Agency" also plots to carry out espionage activities against the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union. It has recruited personnel from the former Japanese military intelligence organization "Shigekawa Agency," Ryuuo Kitahara of the puppet "Shinminkai," and well-known Japanese ronin Hideo Miura and Zenichi Yoshii. It plans to have the "Shigekawa Agency," which carried out the same tasks as the "Cannon Agency" is doing today in North China ten years ago, return to China to operate. At the same time, the "Cannon Agency" has also established a branch office in Hokkaido, Japan, called the "Sapporo Agency," and has set up intelligence outposts in Otaru, Kushiro, Nemuro, Abashiri, and other places, specializing in conspiracy activities against the Soviet Union.

The crime of the "Cannon Agency" transporting a large number of Chinese and Korean prisoners of war to Japan for forced espionage training has also been exposed recently. Yoshijiro Yamada, who worked as a cook at the "Cannon Agency," testified that in October 1951, about twenty Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war were transported by truck at night to No. 740 "American House" in Shibuya, Tokyo. Soon after, the number of prisoners of war increased to one hundred and several dozen. Later, these prisoners of war were moved from No. 740 to the Higashikawa Hall in Kawasaki City. Yoshijiro Yamada said that he had personally seen Chinese and Korean prisoners of war being forced to undergo airborne training.

    美国特务组织“加农机关”
    在日本进行阴谋活动
    【新华社十一日讯】东京消息：直接受华盛顿中央情报局指挥的在日本的美国特务组织“加农机关”，正在进行着反对日本、中国和苏联人民的阴谋活动。
    所谓“加农机关”已因它秘密绑架日本作家鹿地亘的事件被揭露而臭名远扬。这个特务机关是以它的负责人美国加农中校而得名的。“加农机关”的组织很庞大，拥有一百多艘渔船、三十几个“水产公司”和“贸易公司”。数十名官员、记者、实业家、工程师和帮会头目。他们都在加农中校的指挥下，进行着各种罪恶勾当。
    “加农机关”对日本人民争取民族独立的运动，不断进行分裂和破坏活动。它利用日本民族叛徒锅山贞亲、佐野博、田中清玄、南喜一等进行“瓦解”民主民族统一战线和收集反共情报的活动，并企图派人混入日共内部进行间谍活动。“加农机关”并直接控制着吉田政府的特务组织“内阁调查室”。“内阁调查室”负责人村井顺每三天要向“加农机关”报告工作一次。
    “加农机关”也阴谋对中华人民共和国与苏联进行间谍活动。它网罗了前日本军部特务组织“重川机关”的人员、伪“新民会”的北原龙雄以及著名的日本浪人三浦英夫、吉井善一等。计划使十年前曾在华北执行着与今天的“加农机关”执行同样任务的“重川机关”重新到中国活动。同时，“加农机关”在日本北海道也设立了分支机构“扎幌机关”并在小樽、钏路、根室、网走等地设立情报据点，专门进行对苏联的阴谋活动。
    “加农机关”将大批中朝战俘运到日本强制进行间谍训练的罪行，最近也被揭发出来了。曾在“加农机关”担任厨师的山田善二郎证实：一九五一年十月，约有二十名中国人民志愿军战俘在夜里被用卡车载到东京澁谷区“美国房子”七四○号。不久以后，战俘的人数增加到一百几十人。后来，这些战俘被从七四○号房搬到川崎市东川会馆。山田善二郎说，他曾亲眼看到中朝战俘被强制受空降训练。
