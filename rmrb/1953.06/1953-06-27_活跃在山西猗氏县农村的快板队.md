In the villages of Yishi County, Shanxi, the farmers are full of praise when you mention the quick-clapper team. Some say, "The quick-clapper team is great, it performs about everything that happens in the village, and you know the central tasks as soon as you hear it." Others say, "The rhymes are smooth and pleasant to listen to, and they fit our hearts." The quick-clapper team is a mass, amateur propaganda organization form created by the farmers of Yishi County. Because the masses love it and the leadership values it, it has now become a literary and artistic propaganda force popular throughout the county.

The art form of "quick-clapping" has long been popular in the Jinan area, and the masses call it "smooth-talk song" or "rhyming jingle"; in Puju opera, it is called "dry board." In the past, the masses had composed many "mouth songs" to praise labor or satirize landlords.

In recent years, quick-clapping has become even more popular, and many people like Li Youcai have emerged from the masses. Such as Li Xiweng, an old man from Chongxiangxi, Guo Chunxian, a seventy-two-year-old woman from Bailidian, and Li Ruyuan from Tancun Village. They have used popular and vivid mass language to compose many quick-clappers that are welcomed by the masses, which have a great impact on the masses. Especially in the winter of 1951, Li Xiweng was awarded the honorary title of first-class model quick-clapper propagandist twice at the Yuncheng Special District Literary and Art Competition and the First Model Propagandist Representative Conference of the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, which further promoted the development of quick-clapping.

The first to be affected was Tancun Village in the Third District. They organized a dozen or so male and female folk school students, who often used their spare time to recite quick-clappers to the masses for propaganda. In 1952, they collectively recited several quick-clappers at the county's March 8th Women's Day celebration. Because the content was vivid and the form was lively, it caused a sensation among tens of thousands of listeners. Since then, this organizational form of collective quick-clapper performance has been called the quick-clapper team. The emergence of the quick-clapper team has brought a new atmosphere to the propaganda work of Yishi County.

The advantage of the quick-clapper team is that it is light and easy to learn, and it can be combined with the central work in a timely manner. The advantage of singing quick-clappers collectively is that they are recited separately and easy to remember. An ordinary quick-clapper takes several days for one person to memorize when combined with production, but if several people recite it separately, ten sentences for you and eight sentences for him, it can be recited in half a day. When a few people get together, they can perform it by putting it together. This not only solves the difficulty of the masses not being able to cooperate with the central work in a timely manner because they are too busy with production to recite quick-clappers; it also solves the difficulty of the masses having low cultural levels and not being able to recite many words. Last year, during the wheat yield competition, the quick-clapper teams of Gaojiazhuang and Tancun Village, etc., according to the short time and tight work at that time, first had the writing team spare time to compose the quick-clappers, which were reviewed by the party branch and then distributed to the quick-clapper propagandists; the quick-clapper propagandists almost all received the quick-clappers in the morning and recited them while doing production in the afternoon. In the evening, when they met, they performed at mass meetings or patriotic inspection day meetings.

The quick-clapper team learns quickly and promotes in a timely manner, which effectively promotes the evaluation work. When Zhangcun in the Second District was initially brewing for the evaluation, the masses generally disliked the trouble and were afraid of delaying work, saying that the evaluation was superfluous. According to the ideological concerns and reactions of the masses, the quick-clapper team immediately composed quick-clappers such as "Evaluation is Important" and "High-Yield Model" to promptly dispel the ideological concerns of the masses. After hearing the quick-clapper propaganda, the farmer Zhang Fugui said, "With this evaluation, farming has a direction. The government really cares about us. It holds large and small meetings, and it is afraid that we will not think it through, so it also uses quick-clappers to explain." During the evaluation, the Gaojiazhuang quick-clapper team saw that some people in the village were still lazy and greedy, so they composed a quick-clapper about the transformation of the lazy man Liu Futang. More than a dozen lazy people in the village saw that others were praised after their transformation, so they quickly went to work in the fields.

The second advantage of the quick-clapper team is that it is easy to widely absorb the masses to participate in cultural activities. The quick-clapper team is a mass literary and artistic propaganda organization, and it is easy to learn and recite, so it is easy to widely absorb the masses to participate. Many women actively ask to participate in cultural activities after they have just become literate in folk schools and crash courses, but it is not possible for them to recite alone: first, they are shy and unaccustomed to it, and second, they have low cultural levels and find it difficult to remember long words; at the same time, they cannot put down production because of participating in propaganda work. Collective performance, a few sentences for you, a few sentences for her, and it is performed in a lively manner. After performing several times, not only does the expression gradually become generous and natural, but the confidence and mood of reciting quick-clappers are also constantly improved. Some farmers cannot act in plays or sing, and they cannot give speeches, but they are still good at participating in the quick-clapper team. In addition, because the quick-clapper is popular and smooth, and the new words are easy to remember, learning the quick-clapper also improves the culture. Fu Shuijing of the Li Xiweng quick-clapper team said, "This is faster than recognizing words in school." The crash literacy class also used the method of writing quick-clappers to recognize words, and the students were very interested. In this way, more and more people participate in the quick-clapper team. Learning everywhere and reciting everywhere, the propaganda content is invisibly transmitted to every household and deeply rooted in the hearts of the people.

The third advantage of the quick-clapper team is that the propaganda form is lively and diverse, and the masses welcome it. The collective performance form is more lively and diverse than the solo performance. The main forms are: reciting in sections in turn, asking and answering, discussion style, reciting face to face, etc. (there are also solo recitations), various forms are interspersed, lively and exciting, and the effect is good. When the quick-clapper team arrives, the masses surround it without a gap, and follow it wherever it goes.

In the Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement in 1952, the Li Xiweng quick-clapper team learned that several households in the village were preparing to make a big fuss about burying people and getting married, so they composed a quick-clapper on increasing production and practicing economy, in which the harm of waste was described as follows:

	"There is no benefit to mentioning waste, the hole collapses and there is no way to fill it; the wife quarrels, the children make noise, and the landlord follows to ask for money. When production is in trouble, agricultural tools are lacking, and you often suffer some frustration. If you don't have money to buy fertilizer, the land will not be full, and the crops will definitely not grow well..."

The benefits of increasing production and practicing economy were described as follows:

	"It is really good to mention saving, saving money can buy fertilizer, the fields and crops grow well and the harvest is more, combining patriotism and making a fortune. Use dead money, turn it into living money, patriotism and making a fortune are both complete..."

After such comparative propaganda, one farmer originally wanted to spend sixteen stone of wheat on his marriage, but later only spent two stone; one farmer buried his mother, originally planning to spend twenty stone of wheat, but as a result only spent four stone. In just two months, the entire village saved nearly forty stone of wheat just from weddings and funerals. Last spring, when Tancun Village was preventing drought and fighting drought, the masses were generally paralyzed and careless, indifferent, and unwilling to dig wells. The quick-clapper team learned about the tragic scenes of past droughts from the elderly and composed a quick-clapper:

	"The government in the past was too feudal, and did not do things for the people. The third year of Guangxu was a great drought, and the wheat fields only yielded two and a half liters; the wheat was not sown in the autumn, and the people had no hope. The bark and leaves were all cleaned up, and the bark and ropes were used to fill hunger, countless people starved to death, and no one came to take care of this matter. Our village originally had eight hundred households, and only one hundred and ten were left dead and injured. No one made graves for the dead, and a mass grave was dug in the west of the village. I say this you don't believe, there are old men to testify. The old men's testimony is not enough, you can go and see outside the village, the poor Zhuang and Nanzhuang, and there is Yaoyuanzhuang in the west of the village, now there is no one there, and they have all become land for planting fields..."

The quick-clapper team aroused the vigilance of the masses by recalling the propaganda of the tragic scenes of past droughts. Immediately afterwards, they expressed the significance of drought prevention and well digging; as a result, the entire village dug more than forty wells in more than a month and launched a vigorous drought prevention and drought fighting movement, which was praised by the county.

The Yishi County Committee of the Communist Party of China attaches great importance to this new creation. At the beginning, the county party committee sent two working groups to be stationed in Chongxiangxi and Tancun Village to specially train Li Xiweng and Li Haokan (female) two quick-clapper teams; at the county's propagandist training class, they also made demonstration performances and introduced advanced experiences. More than 400 propagandists all praised it and expressed their determination to promote it. The Li Xiweng quick-clapper team did not miss an opportunity to perform everywhere at the entertainment evenings organized by various county-wide meetings and on the stage of professional theater troupes in the city; the Li Haokan quick-clapper team cooperated with the film screening team to perform propaganda in the surrounding villages at night, which played a great demonstration role. At the same time, the Propaganda Department of the County Party Committee must include the use and development of the quick-clapper team in the work plan of the party's propaganda network in each major propaganda campaign plan, and mobilize forces inside and outside the party to implement it. In this way, the quick-clapper teams in various villages have developed in each propaganda movement. These quick-clapper teams have received great attention and specific leadership from the branch and the party's propaganda network.

In addition, the Yishi County-level leaders have also made many efforts in helping to improve the writing level and providing timely materials for storytelling and singing. The county cultural center has successively held meetings of the writing team leaders of the quick-clapper team and meetings of the backbone members of the quick-clapper team, and has specially studied the issues of writing quick-clappers and improving the quick-clapper team. The county also published "Quick-Clapper Storytelling and Singing" (semi-monthly) to provide quick-clapper materials in a timely manner and exchange writing experiences. This publication has also promoted the writing work of various quick-clapper teams. Li Xiweng and Feng Tongsheng composed more than 50 quick-clappers in half a year; in half a year, the county's quick-clapper teams contributed more than 400 pieces to "Quick-Clapper Storytelling and Singing" alone.

Now, the quick-clapper team has become a new force on the propaganda front in Yishi County. By the end of February this year, there were already 120 quick-clapper teams (nearly 3,000 people) in the county, active in various villages. The Yuncheng Local Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Yuncheng Special Office also attached great importance to this mass propaganda organization, and had notified and promoted it to various counties; they also introduced this advanced experience at several plenary sessions of the special area's propaganda and education work conference and the model propagandist representative conference. At present, the seeds of the quick-clapper team have been spread throughout the Yuncheng Special Area.

    活跃在山西猗氏县农村的快板队
    张烽、景文灿、杨扬
    走到山西猗氏县的各个村子里，一提起快板队，农民们就满口称赞。有的说：“快板队真好，村里作啥它表啥，中心工作一听就晓得。”有的说：“表的顺口好听，切合心思。”快板队是猗氏县农民创造的一种群众性的、业余的宣传组织形式，由于群众喜爱，领导上重视，现在已经成为普及全县的一支文艺宣传队伍了。
    “快板”这个文艺形式，在晋南一带早就流传着，群众把它叫做“溜口歌”或“顺口溜”；在蒲剧中叫做“干板”。群众过去曾编了不少“口歌”用来颂扬劳动，或者讥刺地主。
    近几年来，快板更盛行了，群众中涌现出了不少像李有才一样的人物来。如崇相西的李希文老汉，百里店七十二岁的老太太郭春鲜，太范村的李如远等。他们用通俗生动的群众语言编出了许多为群众所欢迎的快板，对群众影响很大。特别是一九五一年冬季，李希文在运城专区文艺竞赛大会上和中共山西省委第一次模范宣传员代表会议上，两次荣获甲等模范快板宣传员的光荣称号后，更推动了快板的发展。
    首先受影响的是三区太范村，他们组织了男女民校学员十几人，经常利用业余时间，给群众念快板作宣传。一九五二年她们在全县三八妇女节庆祝大会上，集体念了几个快板。由于内容生动、形式活泼，轰动了上万听众。此后这个集体表演快板的组织形式就叫快板队。快板队一出现，就为猗氏县的宣传工作带来了新的气象。
    快板队的优点，首先是轻便易学，和中心工作能及时结合。集体唱快板的优点是分开念、容易记。一个普通快板，让一个人结合生产来念，得好几天才能背熟，如果几个人分开念，你十句、他八句，有半天工夫便可以念会，几个人一碰头，对搭起来就能表演。这样既解决了群众因忙于生产没时间念快板而不能及时配合中心工作的困难；也解决了群众文化低、词儿多不易念会的困难。去年小麦丰产评比时，高家庄、太范村等的快板队，根据当时时间短、工作紧的情况，先由编写组抽空编好快板，经党支部审查后，分发给快板宣传员；快板宣传员差不多都是上午领到快板，下午就结合生产捎带念会了。晚上一碰头，便在群众大会上或爱国检查日大会上表演开了。
    快板队学的快，宣传的及时，有力地推动了评比工作。二区张村初酝酿评比时，群众普遍地嫌麻烦、怕误工，说评比是多余的一套。快板队根据群众的思想顾虑和反映，马上就编了“评比重要”“丰产模范”等快板，及时解除群众的思想顾虑。农民张福贵听了快板宣传以后说：“这一评，做庄稼的就有了方向啦，政府对咱真关心，开大会开小会，还怕咱们想不开，又拿快板来讲解。”高家庄快板队在评比时，见本村还有些人好吃懒做，就把懒汉刘富堂转变的事实编了一个快板。村里十多个懒汉见人家转变后受到了表扬，也赶快下地去劳动了。
    快板队的第二个优点，是便于广泛吸收群众参加文化活动。快板队是一种群众性的文艺宣传组织，再加易学易念，因此就容易广泛地吸收群众参加。有许多妇女上民校、住速成班刚识字后，积极要求参加文化活动，但让她们单人独念就不行：一来害臊不习惯，二来文化低词儿长难记；同时，又不能因为参加宣传工作放下生产。集体表演，你几句，她几句，一閧便表开了。表了几次以后，不但表情逐渐大方自然，对念快板的信心和情绪也不断提高。有的农民，演戏唱不来，讲话讲不了，但参加了快板队还是好样的。此外由于快板通俗顺口，生字易记，学快板也就提高了文化。李希文快板队的傅水晶说：“这比上学还认字快。”速成识字班也都运用了写快板识字的方法，大家来编快板，学员们很感兴趣。这样，参加快板队的群众就更多。到处学，到处念，就在无形中把宣传内容传给家家户户，深入人心。
    快板队的第三个优点，是宣传形式活泼多样，群众欢迎。集体的表演形式比单人表演活泼多样。主要形式有：分节轮念、一问一答、讨论式、对口念等（也有独念的），各种形式花插开，活泼热闹，效果良好。快板队一到，群众就围个四面不透风，走到那里跟到那里。
    李希文快板队，在一九五二年增产节约运动中，了解本村有几户埋人娶亲准备大闹，就编了一个增产节约快板，其中对浪费的危害这样说：
     “提起浪费没好处，塌下窟窿没法补；老婆吵、娃娃闹，账主跟着把钱要。闹生产、缺农具，经常受些窝囊气。没钱买肥地不饱，庄稼一定长不好……”
    又对增产节约的好处这样说：
    “提起节约真是好，省钱可以买肥料，田禾长好收的多，爱国发家相结合。用死钱，变活钱，爱国发家两双全……”
    经过这样对比宣传后，有一个农民娶亲原来想花十六石麦，后来只花了两石；有一个农民埋他妈，原计划花二十石麦，结果只花了四石。全村在短短的两个月中，光婚丧嫁娶就节约了近四十石小麦。太范村在去年春天防旱抗旱时，群众普遍麻痹大意，满不在乎，不愿打井。快板队就向老年人了解了过去的旱灾惨景，编了一个快板：
       “过去政府太封建，不给人民把事办。光绪三
    年是大旱，麦田只收二升半；秋未收来麦未种，
    人民没有指望星。树皮树叶齐打净，皮条皮绳把
    饥充，饿死人民无其数，没人来管这事情。咱村
    原有八百户，死伤只剩一百零，死了人没人打
    墓，村西挖下万人坑。我说此话你不信，现有老
    汉作证明。老汉作证还不算，村外你去看一看，
    可怜庄与南庄，村西还有窑院庄，如今全都没人
    烟，都成土地种庄田……”
    快板队通过回忆过去旱灾惨景的宣传，引起了群众的警惕。紧接着他们就表了防旱打井的意义；结果全村一个多月就打了四十多眼井，开展了轰轰烈烈的防旱抗旱运动，得到县上的表扬。
    中共猗氏县委是十分重视这一新的创造的。县委一开始就派了两个工作组，常驻在崇相西和太范村专门培养李希文和李好看（女）两个快板队；在全县的宣传员训练班上，又让他们作了示范演出，介绍了先进经验。四百多宣传员人人称好，个个表示要决心推广。李希文快板队又在全县性的各种会议所组织的娱乐晚会上和城内各职业剧团的舞台上，不放过一个机会地到处表演；李好看快板队，晚上配合电影放映队到周围村表演宣传，都起了很大示范作用。同时，县委宣传部在每次较大的宣传运动计划中，都要把运用与发展快板队订在党的宣传网的工作计划中，动员党内外力量来贯彻。这样，在每次宣传运动中，各个村子的快板队都有了发展。这些快板队，都得到支部和党的宣传网极大的重视和具体的领导。
    此外，在帮助提高编写水平，及时供应说唱材料的工作上，猗氏县级领导上也作了不少努力。县文化馆曾先后召开了快板队的编写组长会议和快板队的骨干分子会议，专门研究了编写快板与提高快板队的问题。县里又出版了“快板说唱”（半月刊），及时供给快板材料，交流编写经验。这个刊物，也推动了各个快板队的编写工作。李希文、冯同生半年就编了五十多个快板；全县快板队半年中，仅向“快板说唱”的投稿就有四百多件。
    现在，快板队在猗氏县的宣传阵线上已成了一支生力军。到今年二月底，全县已经有一百二十个快板队（近三千人），活跃在各个村子里。中共运城地方委员会和运城专署，对这个群众性的宣传组织也极为重视，曾向各县通报推广；并在几次的全专区宣教工作会议和模范宣传员代表会议上介绍了这一先进经验。目前，快板队的种籽已经撒遍全运城专区了。
