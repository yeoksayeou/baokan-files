Xinhua News Agency, June 13th: Some American and British bourgeois newspapers have expressed disappointment and unease over the outcome of the Italian elections.

    A dispatch from Paris by "New York Times" reporter C.L. Sulzberger said: "The political landscape in Europe is changing, and this change can only be regarded as detrimental to American policies and interests." He said that the results of the Italian elections and the political crisis in France both illustrate that the forces supported by the United States during the Cold War are "weakening."

    Scripps-Howard newspapers reporter Schackford pointed out that the US government had "poured more than three billion dollars into Italy" after the war, and the results of this election show that "the West's post-war policy in Italy has been a failure."

    An editorial in the New York "World-Telegram and Sun" stated: Since dollars did not enable Gasperi to win the election, Congress should reconsider its policy towards Italy.

    Washington "Star" reporter Brown said: Gasperi's setback was mainly due to his pro-American attitude.

    British bourgeois newspapers also expressed anxiety and unease about the outcome of the Italian general election. The "Daily Telegraph" said that the results of this election are very "serious" for Italy and the whole of Western Europe. The "Manchester Guardian" said that the prospects for the next five years are not "encouraging."

    对意大利选举结果表示不安
    【新华社十三日讯】美英资产阶级的一些报纸对意大利选举的结果表示失望和不安。
    “纽约时报”记者塞·苏兹贝格从巴黎发的一条电讯中说：“欧洲的政治局面在起着变化，这种变化只能被认为对美国的政策与利益是不利的。”他说：意大利选举的结果和法国的政治危机都说明美国在冷战期间所扶持的力量“正在衰弱下去”。
    斯克利浦斯—霍华德报纸记者沙克福指出，战后美国政府“把三十多亿美元倾入意大利”，这次选举的结果说明“战后西方在意大利的政策是失败了”。
    纽约“世界电讯太阳报”的社论说：由于美元没有使得加斯贝利获得选举的胜利，国会应该重新考虑它对意大利的政策。
    华盛顿“明星报”记者布朗说：加斯贝利之所以受挫，主要是由于他抱着亲美的态度。
    英国资产阶级报纸对意大利大选的结果也表示忧虑不安。“每日电讯报”说：这次选举的结果，对意大利和整个西欧都是非常“严重”的。“曼彻斯特卫报”说，今后五年的前景是不能令人“鼓舞”的。
