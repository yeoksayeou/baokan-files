    Guangxi Military Region Conceals 机关 Production,
    Preventing Printing Plant from Utilizing its Production Capacity
    Letter from Liu Gui, Assistant Manager of Nanning Red Star Printing Plant: In February 1950, the Guangxi Military Region established a printing plant. After the Government Administration Council announced the "Decision on Unified Handling of 机关 Production" in March 1952, some leading comrades in the Military Region, dominated by departmentalism, resorted to deceptive methods, renaming the Military Region's printing plant as "Nanning Red Star Printing Plant" to conceal it and avoid handing it over to the government. Around October 1952, the former Central South News and Publication Bureau asked our plant to provide statistics on its production capacity. The Guangxi Military Region's Propaganda Section then decided to make a false report, underreporting the machinery and equipment. The consequences of this departmentalist error are: the plant's production capacity is not being utilized, and the nation's wealth is suffering great losses. Our entire plant has fifteen printing, typesetting, binding, and other machines, and more than ten type cases; however, the plant does not engage in external business and has very little work. The entire plant has only six printing, typesetting, and binding workers, and six typesetting workers. Even these twelve people have very little to do and are often idle. It is estimated that the plant's production capacity is only being utilized at 27 percent. There is also a great waste of electrical equipment, with a motor that can drive five or more machines only driving one machine. The workers have many complaints and urgently demand an early resolution to this problem.

    广西军区隐匿机关生产
    使印刷厂生产能力不能发挥
    南宁红星印刷厂厂务助理员刘桂来信：广西军区在一九五○年二月成立了一个印刷厂。一九五二年三月政务院公布了“关于统一处理机关生产的决定”后，军区某些领导同志在本位主义思想支配下，竟采取欺骗办法，将军区印刷厂改名为“南宁红星印刷厂”，隐匿不交政府接管。一九五二年十月前后，原中南新闻出版处让我厂统计工厂生产能力。广西军区宣传科又决定做假报告，少报机器设备。这种本位主义的错误行为所造成的恶果是：工厂生产能力得不到发挥，国家财富遭受很大的损失。我们全厂共有印刷、铸字、装订等各种机器十五部、字架十多副；但工厂不对外营业，工作很少，全厂就只有印刷、铸字、装订工人六人，排字工人六人。就是这十二个人工作也很清闲，经常没事做。据估计，工厂生产能力只发挥了百分之二十七。在电力设备方面浪费也很大，一部可以带动五部以上机器的马达只带动着一部机器。工人群众意见很多，迫切要求早日解决这个问题。
