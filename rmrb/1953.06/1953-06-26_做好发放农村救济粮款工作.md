    Do a Good Job in Distributing Rural Relief Grain and Funds
    Central Production and Disaster Relief Committee Office
    After several major grain-producing areas in the country suffered disasters this time, the Central People's Government allocated a large amount of relief grain and funds to help the disaster-stricken people to carry out the current agricultural production smoothly and ensure the autumn harvest. If this batch of grain and funds is distributed well, it will not only enable the disaster-stricken people to survive the summer famine, but also enable them to have the strength to produce, strive for a bumper autumn harvest, and avoid the continuation of the disaster. Therefore, it is very important to do a good job in distributing this batch of grain and funds.
    In the past, various localities have gained many good experiences in the distribution of relief grain and funds. However, many regions have also experienced some serious deviations, turning the good deed of distributing relief grain and funds to help disaster victims into a bad thing, causing dissatisfaction among the masses. In this distribution, we must learn from past experiences and lessons, no longer repeat mistakes, conscientiously implement the "production for self-relief" policy, and do a good job in the distribution of relief grain and funds.
    At present, in the distribution of relief grain and funds in various places, in addition to the phenomenon of backlog in individual areas, the most important problem is that some leading organs and grassroots cadres have not grasped the disaster situation, the cadres are taking over and doing everything themselves, making their own decisions, and thus the distribution is improper, blindly allocating relief grain and funds. In many areas, when distributing relief grain and funds, the importance is reversed, the severely affected areas feel that "there are too many monks and too little gruel," and there is waste in the lightly affected areas. In Yanggang Township, Fifth District, Yicheng County, Hubei Province, 54 households were provided with relief, and an inspection revealed that 52 households were provided with inappropriate relief. Zhang Genbo's family in Zhuoyu Village, Second District, Changge County, Henan Province, had hundreds of kilograms of wheat in storage, but the village cadres insisted on designating him as a relief recipient and wanted to distribute relief grain to him, even he himself disagreed. In Wudi County, Shandong Province, after inspection, 75 percent of the relief households did not need relief. As a result, the relief grain and funds were abused and wasted on the one hand, and on the other hand, they could not truly solve the difficulties of the disaster victims. Some disaster victims have been eating wild vegetables for a long time, even running out of food, and cannot get relief, or get very little relief, and have to go hungry again after a few days. This phenomenon exists in Anhui and Henan provinces.
    Secondly, some areas lack ideological guidance and specific organizational work for production for self-relief and saving to overcome the famine in the distribution of relief grain and funds. Cadres do not actively educate the masses to produce and save, and do not organize the masses to participate in production. For example, some township cadres in Anhui Province simply advised the disaster victims who were not assessed for relief to "wait for the next" relief grain. This has fostered the masses' idea of ​​simply relying on government relief. In some areas, as soon as relief grain is distributed, the masses demand relief, forming a phenomenon of "everyone reaching out and everyone wanting money." Some people have surplus grain at home, but they still cry and pretend to be poor. Some areas believe that eating relief grain is a "political treatment." Therefore, the distribution of relief grain and funds not only fails to stimulate the disaster victims to actively produce, but also makes production slack and production organization scattered. The Wang Xuejun sideline mutual aid group in Huangqiao Township, Lingbi County, Anhui Province, achieved great results in its work; but it suddenly announced its collapse during the Spring Festival this year. The reason is that after the Spring Festival, the government wanted to distribute relief grain, and everyone was waiting to eat relief grain. In the Sixian area of ​​the province, there is also a popular saying: "If you don't work hard in May and June, you will rely on the government in October and December."
    Finally, in the distribution of relief grain and funds, the phenomenon of some grassroots cadres engaging in favoritism, embezzlement and corruption of relief grain and funds continues to occur. The director of the Fish Child Township Farmers Association in Wudu County, Gansu Province, etc., received relief grain without discussion by the masses. The township head of Shahe Township, Baocheng County, Shaanxi Province, disregarded the opposition of the masses and arbitrarily distributed relief grain to township cadres. In some areas, the amount of relief given to cadres themselves is several times more than that of the masses. These have seriously affected the progress of the distribution work.
    In order to overcome the above-mentioned deviations and achieve the purpose of distributing relief grain and funds to support disaster victims in production and overcome the disaster, the following issues must be paid attention to in future work in various localities:
    1. Further explain the policy and scope of distribution of relief grain and funds to grassroots cadres, and clarify the cadres' understanding. It should be explained to cadres and the masses that our policy is "production for self-relief," using relief grain to help disaster victims carry out production, so that disaster victims can finally solve their difficulties from production. Therefore, the government cannot take over all the food shortage of the disaster victims who can produce. Therefore, when distributing relief grain, it is necessary to take care of the food shortage of the disaster victims and consider the production conditions of the disaster victims. First of all, take care of the orphans, widows, disabled and elderly who have no production capacity, followed by food-deficient households with production capacity. However, the food shortage and production capacity of each household are different, so it is necessary to distinguish between the severity and provide relief according to different situations.
    2. Strengthen the education of grassroots cadres on democratic work style and democratic work methods. The distribution of relief grain is a mass work, and it is also an extremely complex and meticulous work. It must be done well by promoting democracy and following the mass line. Therefore, it cannot be taken over and done by a few cadres, let alone engage in private feelings and take advantage; but it cannot be left to its own devices, holding mass meetings without leadership and conducting deliberations without boundaries. Before the distribution, it is necessary to conduct specific investigations to grasp the food shortage situation and study the production conditions of each disaster household; then absorb active and impartial members or representatives from the disaster victims to participate in discussions, propose a list of relief recipients, and determine the amount of relief; then pass the review through mass evaluation or holding a township people's representative meeting, and approved by the district people's government.
    3. While distributing relief grain, it is also necessary to educate the masses on "production for self-relief" and "saving to overcome the famine," and specifically organize the masses to participate in possible production to overcome the masses' idea of ​​simply relying on it. This requires first of all overcoming the dependence and patronage ideas existing among the cadres, and correcting the erroneous idea of ​​only reaching out to ask for it from above and not actively organizing the masses to carry out production. It should be clearly recognized that the distribution of relief grain is not only used to solve the current living difficulties, but also to improve production and seek to completely eliminate the threat of disaster. In organizing the masses to carry out production, some specific difficulties of the masses must be helped to solve, such as the funds for sideline production, the sales channels for products, and the difficulties in agricultural production such as agricultural tools and seeds.
    4. It is an important link in doing a good job in distributing relief grain that leading cadres above the county and district levels pay attention to and regularly check and study the distribution work. Some provincial responsible comrades personally went to the countryside to check the distribution of relief grain, which is a very good example. Special districts and counties should also do the same. The inspection should not only check the distribution situation at that time, but also check the use of relief grain and funds after the distribution, so as to ensure that the relief grain and funds are distributed properly and used properly.

    做好发放农村救济粮款工作
    中央生产救灾委员会办公室
    这次全国几个主要产麦地区遭受灾害以后，中央人民政府曾拨下大批救济粮款，帮助灾民顺利进行当前的农业生产，保证秋收。这批粮款发放的好，就不仅能使灾民安渡夏荒，而且还能使灾民有力量生产，争取秋季丰收，避免灾荒的延续。因此，做好这次粮款发放工作是非常重要的。
    过去，各地在发放救济粮款工作中，已经获得许多良好经验。但是，不少地区也发生过一些严重的偏向，把发放救济粮款，帮助灾民这样的好事做坏了，引起群众不满。在这次发放工作中，必须吸取过去的经验教训，不再重复错误，认真贯彻“生产自救”方针，做好救济粮款发放工作。
    目前，各地在发放救济粮款工作中，除个别地区还有积压现象外，最主要的一个问题是有些领导机关和基层干部没有掌握灾情，干部包办代替，自作主张，因而发放不当，盲目分配救济粮款。许多地区在分配救济粮款时，轻重倒置，灾重地区感到“僧多粥少”，灾轻地区发生浪费现象。湖北省宜城县五区杨岗乡救济了五十四户，经检查有五十二户救济不当。河南省长葛县二区琢玉村张根波家里存有几百斤小麦，村干部硬指定他为救济对象，要给他发放救济粮，连他本人也不同意。山东省无棣县有的村经过检查后，救济户当中有百分之七十五是不需要救济的。这样就使得救济粮款一方面被滥用和浪费，另方面也不能真正解决灾民的困难。有的灾民吃了很久野菜，甚至断炊，得不到救济，或者得到的救济很少，吃不上几天又要挨饿。安徽、河南等省都有这种现象。
    其次，有的地区在发放救济粮款当中，缺乏生产自救、节约渡荒的思想指导和具体组织工作。干部不积极教育群众生产节约，不组织群众参加生产。如安徽省有的乡干部，对未评上救济的灾民，只单纯地劝他们“等下一次”的救济粮。这样，就助长了群众单纯依赖政府救济的思想。有些地区一发救济粮，群众都要求救济，形成“人人伸手，个个要钱”的现象。有的家中有余粮，还要哭叫装穷。有的地区认为吃救济粮是“政治待遇”。因此，使发放救济粮款工作，不但不能刺激灾民积极生产，反而使生产松劲，使生产组织涣散。安徽省灵璧县黄桥乡王学俊副业互助组，工作很有成绩；但在今年春节时，忽然宣布垮台了。原因是春节过后，政府要发放救济粮，大家都等吃救济粮。该省泗县一带还流行着“五伏六月不下苦，十冬腊月靠政府”的歌谣。
    最后，在发放救济粮款中，部分基层干部徇私舞弊，贪污救济粮款的现象还不断发生。甘肃省武都县鱼童乡农会主任等，未经群众讨论就领了救济粮。陕西省褒城县沙河乡乡长不顾群众反对，擅自将救济粮发给乡干部。有的地区干部自己救济自己的数量，比群众多几倍。这些都严重地影响了发放工作的进行。
    为了克服上述偏向，达到发放救济粮款支持灾民进行生产，渡过灾荒的目的，各地在今后工作中，必须注意下面几个问题：
    一、进一步向基层干部交代清楚发放救济粮款的方针和发放范围，澄清干部的认识。应当向干部和群众说明，我们的方针是“生产自救”，用救济粮帮助灾民进行生产，使灾民最后从生产中来解决自己的困难。因此，政府不能把能生产的灾民所缺口粮全部包下来。这样，在发放救济粮时，既要照顾灾民的缺粮情况，又要考虑到灾民的生产条件。首先要照顾无生产能力的孤寡残老，其次是有生产能力的缺粮户。但每户的缺粮情况与生产能力各不相同，这就要分出轻重，根据不同情况，进行救济。
    二、加强对基层干部民主作风和民主工作方法的教育。发放救济粮是一个群众性的工作，同时又是极为复杂细致的工作，必须发扬民主，走群众路线，才能做得好。因此，不能由少数干部包办代替，更不能耍私情，占便宜；但也不能放任自流，无领导地召开群众大会，漫无边际地进行评议。在发放前要先经过具体调查掌握缺粮情况，并研究各灾户生产条件；然后吸收灾民中积极公正分子或代表人物参加讨论，提出救济对象名单，确定救济数量；再通过群众评议或召开乡人民代表会议审查通过，经区人民政府批准。
    三、发放救济粮的同时，还要向群众进行“生产自救”、“节约渡荒”的教育，并具体组织群众参加可能进行的生产，克服群众的单纯依赖思想。这就要首先克服干部当中存在的依赖思想与恩赐观点，纠正只会伸手向上要，不去积极组织群众进行生产的错误思想。应该明确认识发放救济粮不只是用来解决目前的生活困难，同时还要用来搞好生产，求得彻底解除灾荒的威胁。在组织群众进行生产中，群众有一些具体困难，必须帮助解决，如副业生产的资金，产品销路，农业生产的农具、种籽的困难等等。
    四、县区以上领导干部重视并经常检查与研究发放工作，是做好发放救济粮工作的重要环节。有的省负责同志亲自下乡检查发放救济粮工作，这是很好的榜样。专区、县也应该这样做。检查时不只是检查当时发放情况，还要检查发放以后救济粮款使用情况，这样才能保证救济粮款发的当、用的当。
