    Any International Dispute Can Be Resolved Through Negotiation
    Hu Jin
    The Soviet government's repeated statements of willingness to resolve international disputes or outstanding issues based on mutual agreement between the countries concerned, and the major achievement of China and North Korea in promoting an armistice in Korea, have further encouraged the confidence of people in all countries in striving for the resolution of disputes through big power consultation to ease international tensions, and have greatly developed this worldwide movement.
    The possibility of cooperation between major powers on the basis of equality and mutual benefit is based on the Leninist-Stalinist principle that two different systems, capitalism and socialism, can coexist peacefully and compete peacefully for a long time. In the current international relations, major power consultations and agreements can guarantee the solution of various urgent international problems and maintain international peace and security.
    On April 2, 1952, Comrade Stalin, in answering questions raised by a group of American newspaper editors, affirmed that talks between the leaders of major powers could be beneficial, and pointed out: "If there is a desire for mutual cooperation, a willingness to fulfill the obligations undertaken, and the principles of equality and non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries are observed, then peaceful coexistence between capitalism and communism is entirely possible." On December 25 of the same year, Comrade Stalin, in answering a question posed by "New York Times" diplomatic correspondent Reston, stated that "We still believe that a war between the United States of America and the Soviet Union should not be considered inevitable, and that our two countries can continue to coexist peacefully in the future." At that time, he also welcomed the suggestion of holding a meeting with Eisenhower on the issue of easing international tensions.
    The Soviet government, headed by Comrade Malenkov, continues to faithfully implement the tried and tested peaceful foreign policy planned by Comrades Lenin and Stalin. In his speech at the Fourth Session of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, Comrade Malenkov pointed out: "At present, there is no dispute or outstanding issue that cannot be peacefully resolved on the basis of mutual agreement between the countries concerned. This refers to our relations with all countries, including the United States."
    The honest and sincere desire for peace repeatedly expressed by the Soviet government has aroused increasingly widespread sympathy and support among international figures, and has become a huge movement in the struggle for peace by the people of all countries. From the First World Peace Congress in the spring of 1949 to the World People's Peace Congress in December 1952, peace gatherings, increasingly representative of hundreds of millions of people, put forward the just demand for a five-power agreement and appealed to the five-power governments.
    In recent months, efforts to ease international tensions have grown unprecedentedly among a wide range of international figures. Some politicians in Western countries have been forced to adopt a realistic attitude when assessing certain important factors in the current international situation.
    The Soviet "Pravda" published editorials on April 25 and May 24, respectively, providing penetrating analyses of this major development in the current international situation. One can clearly see from this: what powerful factors prompted Eisenhower, in a speech apparently in response to the peace initiative of the Soviet government, to say that "the United States is willing to do its part" to resolve international disputes, and what is the significance of Churchill's proposal to hold a major power conference.
    The May 24 "Pravda" editorial wrote: "Any step forward in resolving disputes will reduce the danger of war, help to end the ruinous arms race that is afflicting all countries, and ease the minds of millions of people. Conversely, maintaining international tensions means further intensifying the arms race, continuing to increase military expenditures, and constantly increasing the heavy tax burden, mainly on the shoulders of the masses. In this context, any new step taken by any government on the international stage becomes the object of close study not only by governments but also by the broadest sections of the public."
    That is to say, resolving disputes through major power consultations to ease international tensions has become the common desire of the people of all countries. In countries that have suffered increasingly serious damage from implementing the US policy of war preparation and war, politicians who hope to lead their countries out of the abyss of economic crisis and military adventure also feel the importance of developing international political and economic relations. "New York Times" diplomatic correspondent Reston wrote on April 17: "The economic background is the consideration behind every move of Britain. Since the beginning of the Cold War, defense spending has worried Britain. For this reason alone, Britain hopes to see a relaxation of tensions with the Communists."
    Precisely for this reason, the new peace initiatives of China and the Soviet Union immediately aroused great reactions among international figures and governments of various countries, and opened up the possible prospect of major power consultations to ease international tensions.
    This is particularly importantly reflected in the attitudes taken by the US and British governments towards the issue of major power consultations.
    Eisenhower delivered a foreign policy speech on April 16, responding to the Soviet government's peace initiative. Eisenhower did not openly adopt a hostile and rejecting attitude towards the Soviet peace initiative, saying: "We seek a genuine and comprehensive peace throughout Asia, as throughout the world." He also said: "As long as there is a willingness to respect the rights of all countries, there is no problem, no matter how large or small, that cannot be resolved." These words received a good international response. However, other opinions in Eisenhower's speech did not offer any useful suggestions for resolving international disputes. On the contrary, he put forward a series of preconditions to the Soviet Union, trying to put the responsibility for creating international tensions on the Soviet Union. This attitude, which does not adopt the spirit of consultation to solve problems at all, can only block the road to resolving disputes through consultation in practice.
    Eisenhower's attitude aroused dissatisfaction from all parties. "Indian Express" said: "Many of America's 'friends' are indignant that the United States insists that the Soviet Union take peaceful action, while Washington offers no guarantee of any concessions." The British "Observer" said: "In Korea (and in Europe), we can only strive for a negotiated peace." The newspaper reflected some realistic views among the British upper classes, saying: "Any peaceful settlement based on the current balance of power cannot make the 'liberation' of Eastern European communist countries a condition for it." It also said: "In every conflict, there will be a moment when the true balance of power has been fully tested and determined, and there is no benefit to continuing the conflict. We are at this moment now." The British "Reynold's News" further reflected British dissatisfaction with the US attitude towards the Soviet peace initiative, believing that if this attitude is not changed, then "it will inevitably make any hope of peace disappear." The newspaper also loudly called: "The United States should understand unequivocally that it cannot expect to drag Britain along to implement a policy that is clearly contrary to our vital interests."
    Prime Minister Churchill's foreign policy speech on May 11, although supporting the US government's position on many points, reflected the British public's desire for peace and adopted a realistic attitude different from that of the United States in its proposals and suggestions on some important issues. First, Churchill advocated that the eight-point proposal put forward by the Korean and Chinese sides for resolving the POW issue should be considered patiently and sympathetically, and said, "At present, in my opinion, we have no reason to believe that this cannot become the basis for reaching an agreement." Second, Churchill believed that "I do not believe that the major problem of reconciling the security of the Soviet Union and the freedom and security of Western Europe is insoluble." Then, Churchill put forward the constructive suggestion of holding a major power conference. He neither stipulated that one party must undertake any obligations as a precondition for the suggestion of convening the conference, nor did he believe that "unless every problem is solved, it is not possible to solve any problem with the Soviet Union."
    Churchill's opinions on the Korean armistice negotiations and his suggestion to hold a major power conference are of constructive significance. It has aroused a good response not only in Britain but also around the world. The peace initiatives of China and the Soviet Union, with the support of a wide range of international figures, have brought new and important progress to the current international situation.
    In particular, at this time, the progress of the Korean armistice negotiations has attracted the attention of the whole world. The repeated concessions made by the Korean and Chinese side on the steps and methods of repatriating prisoners of war, as well as the successive proposals for resolving the POW issue, have further won widespread sympathy and support from countries around the world, causing the US government to withdraw its unreasonable twenty-six-point "counter-proposal," and, through consultations between the two sides, the POW issue, which had been hindering the final agreement of the Korean armistice negotiations, was finally resolved.
    The entire process of the Korean armistice negotiations once again proved that any international dispute or outstanding issue can be resolved through negotiation; and this possibility is not determined by the subjective desires of those warmongers who desperately oppose negotiated solutions and attempt to continue and expand international disputes. Haven't the American warmongers recently been endlessly clamoring about what "the United States should risk a 'foreseeable danger' of fighting the Soviet Union by expanding the Korean War" (Nolan); and what "going it alone" (Taft) and other kinds of crazy talk? However, the efforts of the world's public to strive for a peaceful and negotiated solution to the Korean issue are sufficient to overwhelm these forces that are extremely harmful to human peace.
    Therefore, this agreement on the Korean armistice negotiations will inevitably greatly encourage the efforts of people all over the world to strive for the resolution of disputes through consultation. As the "Pravda" editorial pointed out, the Korean issue is one of the most important international issues, and progress in the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue will be conducive to easing the tension in the international situation and preparing the ground for resolving other international issues.
    Now, the mood of the world public to welcome the holding of a major power conference and to demand that the countries concerned resolve various urgent international issues in the spirit of equal consultation is growing more and more. People are rightly demanding that not only the Korean issue, but also other international issues should be resolved through consultation, so that the entire international situation can be eased. Therefore, people are closely watching the Bermuda Conference, which is currently being planned by the United States, Britain, and France, as well as the various activities surrounding the plan for this conference. As the "Pravda" editorial sharply revealed, if the Bermuda Conference, as a new conspiracy of Western countries, attempts to eliminate their differences, especially on the issue of resolving international disputes through major power consultations, and continues to pursue a policy of hostility rather than consultation with the Soviet Union, then it can only undermine the possibility of major power consultations and the possibility of a comprehensive easing of international tensions.
    In particular, the warmongers in the US ruling class, just as the Korean armistice negotiations have made significant progress, the armistice is about to be realized, and the entire international tension is tending to ease, their clamor against the Korean armistice, doubting the significance of the Korean armistice, being hostile to the People's Republic of China, and opposing major power consultations, has also become even more rampant. For example, Taft's recent foreign policy speech openly said: "Under the current circumstances, even the most perfect armistice is absolutely unsatisfactory." He purposefully said that the Korean armistice, which has opened the way for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, is "to divide Korea along an artificial boundary and create an unstable situation that will cause war to break out again at any moment." Thus, he said how unwilling he was to further realize the peaceful reunification of Korea after the armistice, saying: "If we once realize the current armistice, no matter what terms we stipulate in the agreement on the future reunification of Korea, the possibility of reunifying Korea will not be greater than the possibility of reunifying Germany." At the same time, Taft comprehensively expressed his extreme opposition to consulting with the Soviet Union to resolve international problems, he clamored: "The current government has the responsibility to try to maintain this worldwide alliance against the Soviet Union in the face of the Soviet Union," he also slandered "Recent events in Britain and France indicate that they are eager to solve problems with Russia and restore more trade," "meaning... the entire anti-Russian military alliance is weak."
    These clamors of Taft and his ilk clearly expose the ulterior motives of the American warmongers. They are doing their utmost to undermine the peaceful resolution of any urgent international problem, and are even more unwilling to see the negotiated settlement of other international problems due to the realization of the Korean armistice, so that international tensions can continue to be maintained.
    In fact, this intention of the American warmongers has been constantly exposed since the peace initiatives of China and the Soviet Union were put forward.
    A report in the Washington "Daily News" on April 4 reflected the US concern that the peace initiatives of China and the Soviet Union "may cause a chain reaction that changes the entire world situation." It listed "the following possibilities that will arise if peace is realized at this time," such as "the settlement of the Korean War will naturally cancel the UN embargo on China, and trade between East and West will become active"; "A German peace treaty and a unified Germany may cause the United States to lose an ally"; "The North Atlantic Treaty Organization, which is still only an empty shell, will be in danger of collapse," as well as so-called "rapid and disastrous demobilization" and "economic collapse," and so on.
    "Business Week," published on the same day, also expressed the same concerns. It talked about all aspects of the US aggressive policies in the Far East and Europe, saying that "Assuming that a ceasefire is achieved in Korea soon, then the West's problems (i.e., the many problems caused by the US aggressive policy) will therefore be shaken."
    Therefore, the "general opinion in Washington" revealed by the "New York Times" on April 5 believed that "In Korea, it is possible to truly obtain a ceasefire, but it is still a long way to go to seek a total solution in Korea and other parts of the world under conditions acceptable to the United States."
    Obviously, all arguments that believe that the Korean issue cannot be further peacefully resolved after the realization of the armistice in Korea, and that seek the negotiated resolution of other urgent international issues, are untenable. In the United States and other capitalist countries, there are precisely such people who, for them, delaying the resolution of international disputes or outstanding issues and maintaining a tense and hostile situation between the two camps means that they can continue to maintain maximum profits in large numbers of military orders and in the increasing taxation of the people.
    However, more and more people in countries around the world see that, no matter how different the social systems of various countries are, it is entirely possible to achieve peace and develop cooperation between the peoples of various countries in trade, economic and cultural fields; doing so is in the interests of all countries, including the United States, if the United States is willing to do so.
    Therefore, the peaceful efforts to promote the resolution of international disputes through major power consultations, which are currently being carried out among a wide range of international figures, will be encouraged by the progress of the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, and will be full of confidence to overcome all obstacles and strive for greater victories. This increasingly powerful peace movement has proven in the past and will prove in the future that it cannot be stopped by any reactionary forces.

    任何国际争端都可以协商解决
    胡今
    苏联政府一再重申愿意在有关各国彼此协议的基础上解决国际争端或悬案的声明，和中朝两国促成朝鲜停战的重大成就，进一步鼓舞了各国人民争取大国协商解决争端以缓和国际紧张局势的信心，并大大地开展了这一遍及全世界的运动。
    大国协议并在平等和互利的基础上实行合作的可能性，是以列宁、斯大林关于资本主义和社会主义两种不同制度有可能长期共处与和平竞赛的原则为依据的。而在现行国际关系中，大国进行协商并取得协议，就能保证各种紧迫的国际问题的解决，维持国际的和平与安全。
    一九五二年四月二日，斯大林同志在答复一批美国报纸编辑提出的问题时，就肯定了各大国领袖举行会谈可能会有益处，并指出：“如果有着互相合作的愿望，有着履行所承担的义务的意愿，并且平等与不干涉他国内政的原则得到遵守，那末资本主义与共产主义的和平共处就是十分可能的。”同年十二月二十五日，斯大林同志在答复美国“纽约时报”外交记者赖斯顿所提的问题时，又表示“我们仍然相信：不能认为美利坚合众国和苏联之间的战争是不可避免的，我们两国在今后也能够和平共处。”他当时并表示欢迎关于和艾森豪威尔就缓和国际紧张形势的问题举行会晤的建议。
    以马林科夫同志为首的苏联政府，继续忠诚地执行列宁、斯大林同志所规划的久经考验的和平外交政策。马林科夫同志在苏联最高苏维埃第四次会议上的发言中，就指出：“现在，没有任何纠纷或悬案不能在有关各国互相协议的基础上和平解决。这是指我们和一切国家的关系，包括美国在内。”
    苏联政府一再表明的这个正直和真诚的和平愿望，在国际人士中引起了越来越广泛的同情和支持，并成了各国人民争取和平斗争中的巨大运动。自一九四九年春天第一次世界拥护和平大会到一九五二年十二月世界人民和平大会，日益广泛地代表亿兆人民举行的和平集会，都提出了争取五大国协议的正义要求，并向五大国政府发出呼吁。
    最近几个月来，在广泛的国际人士中间，为缓和国际紧张关系而进行的努力，更是空前地增长起来。西方国家中的一些政治家，不能不开始在估计目前国际局势的某些重要因素时采取现实的态度。
    苏联“真理报”在四月二十五日和五月二十四日先后发表的社论中，对当前国际局势的这一重大发展作了透辟的分析。人们可以从这里清晰地看到：究竟是什么强有力的因素促使艾森豪威尔在显然是为答复苏联政府的和平倡议而发表的演说中表示“美国愿意尽它应尽的本分”来解决国际争端，邱吉尔提出举行大国会议的建议又有什么意义。
    “真理报”五月二十四日社论写道：“在解决争端方面的任何一个前进的步骤，都会减少战争危险，有助于终止使各国招致毁灭的扩张军备运动，并宽慰千百万人的心情。相反地，保持国际紧张局势就意味着进一步加紧进行备战，继续增加军事开支和不断提高主要是压在人民大众肩上的赋税重担。在这种情况下，任何一国政府在国际舞台上所采取的任何一个新的步骤，都成为不仅是政府方面而且是最广泛的人士予以密切研究的对象。”
    这就是说，大国协商解决争端以缓和国际局势，已成为各国人民的共同愿望。在长期来执行美国备战政策和战争政策而使自己遭受到日益严重的损害的国家里，那些希望使本国走出经济危机和军事冒险的深渊的政治家们，也感到发展国际政治经济关系的重要了。“纽约时报”外交记者赖斯顿在四月十七日写道：“经济背景是英国每一个举动的考虑所在。自从冷战开始以来，国防用费就使英国感到担忧。仅仅为了这个理由，英国就希望看到与共产党的紧张关系缓和下来。”
    正因如此，中苏两国的新的和平倡议，立刻在国际人士和各国政府中引起了巨大的反应，并开展了大国协商以缓和国际紧张局势的可能的前景。
    这特别重要地反映在美英两国政府对大国协商问题所采取的态度上。
    艾森豪威尔在四月十六日发表了外交政策演说，答复苏联政府的和平倡议。艾森豪威尔并没有对苏联的和平倡议公然采取敌视和拒绝的态度，他说：“我们在整个亚洲，正如在整个世界一样，寻求一个真正的全面的和平。”他又说：“只要有尊重一切国家权利的意愿，这些问题不问大小没有一个是不可以解决的。”他的这些话得到了国际间的良好反应。但是，艾森豪威尔演说的其他意见中，并没有对解决国际争端提出任何有益的建议，相反地，他向苏联提出了一连串的先决条件，想把造成国际紧张局势的责任推在苏联身上。这种完全不是采取协商精神解决问题的态度，实际上就只能阻塞协商解决争端的道路。
    艾森豪威尔的这个态度，引起了各方的不满。“印度快报”说：“许多美国的‘友人们’，对于美国坚持要由苏联作出和平的行动而华盛顿方面丝毫没有任何让步的保证这一点，都感到愤慨。”英国“观察家”说：“在朝鲜（以及在欧洲），我们只能力求一个谈判的和平。”该报反映了英国上层人物中的一些现实看法说：“任何以现在的力量均衡为基础的和平解决，都不能以‘解放’东欧共产党国家作为它的条件。”并说：“在每一个冲突中都会产生
    一个时刻，在这一时刻，真正的力量均衡已经通过充分的考验并确定下来，继续冲突下去是不会得到什么好处的了。现在我们正处在这个时刻。”英国
    “雷诺新闻”更进一步地反映了英国对美国对待苏联和平倡议的态度的不满，认为这种态度如果不加以改变，那末，“必然将使任何和平的希望消失”。该报并大声疾呼：“美国应该不含糊地理解到，它不能期待把英国拖在一起，来执行一种显然与我们的切身利益背道而驰的政策了。”
    邱吉尔首相在五月十一日发表的外交政策演说，虽然在许多点上支持美国政府的立场，但对某些重要问题的提法和建议，反映了英国公众舆论的和平愿望，采取了与美国不同的现实态度。首先，邱吉尔主张应对朝中方面所提出的解决战俘问题的八点方案进行耐心而同情的考虑，并说“目前以我之见，我们没有理由认为这不可能成为达成协议的基础。”其次，邱吉尔认为“我不相信使苏联的安全和西欧的自由与安全协调一致这样重大的问题，是不能解决的”。接着，邱吉尔并提出了举行大国会议的建设性建议，他既没有规定一方必须承担任何义务作为召开会议的建议的先决条件，也不认为“除非每个问题都获得解决，否则就不能够与苏联解决任何问题”。
    邱吉尔关于朝鲜停战谈判的意见和举行大国会议的建议，富有建设性的意义。它不仅在英国，而且在世界各地，都引起了良好反应。中苏两国的和平倡议，在广泛的国际人士的支持下，已使当前国际局势获得了新的重要进展。
    特别是，在这个时候，朝鲜停战谈判的进展，吸引了全世界的注意力。朝中方面在遣返战俘的步骤和方法上的一再让步，以及先后提出的解决战俘问题的方案，进一步地博得了世界各国广泛的同情和支持，使得美国政府撤回了它的不合理的二十六点
    “反建议”，在双方协商下，阻碍朝鲜停战谈判最后达成协议的战俘问题终于达成了协议。
    朝鲜停战谈判的整个过程，又一次证明了任何国际纠纷或悬案都是可以协商解决的；而这一可能性，并不是决定于那些死命反对协商解决、并企图继续和扩大国际纠纷的好战分子的主观愿望的。美国的好战分子最近不是毫无休止地叫嚷什么“美国应该因扩大朝鲜战争而一冒与苏联作战的‘意料中的危险’”（诺兰）；以及什么“单独干下去”
    （塔夫脱）之类的狂言妄语吗？然而，世界各国公众争取和平协商解决朝鲜问题的努力，足以压倒这些极端危害人类和平的势力。
    因此，朝鲜停战谈判的这个协议，必然会极大地鼓舞全世界人民争取协商解决争端的努力。正如“真理报”社论所指出的，朝鲜问题是最重要的国际问题之一，和平解决朝鲜问题的进展，将有利于缓和国际形势中的紧张局面，并为解决其他国际问题准备基础。
    现在，世界公众欢迎举行大国会议，要求有关各国以平等协商的精神解决各项紧迫的国际问题的情绪，就越来越增长了。人们正当地要求不仅是朝鲜问题、而且是其他国际问题都应协商解决，使整个国际形势缓和下来。因此，人们正在密切注视目前美英法三国酝酿举行的百慕大会议，以及围绕着这个会议的计划而进行的各种活动。正如“真理报”社论所尖锐地揭露的那样，百慕大会议作为西方国家的一种新的共谋，企图消除它们之间的分歧，特别是在大国协商解决国际争端问题上的分歧，继续推行与苏联敌对而不是协商的政策，那就只能使大国协商的可能性和国际紧张局势全面缓和下来的可能性受到破坏。
    特别是美国统治阶级中的好战分子们，正当朝鲜停战谈判获得重大进展，停战即将实现，整个国际紧张局势趋向缓和的时候，他们反对朝鲜停战、怀疑朝鲜停战的意义、敌视中华人民共和国和反对大国协商的种种喧嚷，也更加嚣张起来了。例如塔夫脱最近发表的外交演说，公然说：“在目前的情况下，即使是最完善的停战也是绝对不能令人满意的”。他把打开了和平解决朝鲜问题的道路的朝鲜停战，别有用心地说是“将按照一条人为的界线来分裂朝鲜，并制造一种在任何时刻都会再度引起战争的不稳定的情况”。于是，他就说出了他是如何不愿停战后进一步实现朝鲜的和平统一，他说：“如果我们一旦实现目前的停战，不论我们在关于以后统一朝鲜的谈判的协议中规定一些什么条款，统一朝鲜的可能性都不会比统一德国的可能性为大”。同时，塔夫脱并全面地表示他极端反对和苏联协商解决国际问题，他叫嚣说：“现政府有责任设法在苏联面前保持这个世界范围的对付苏联的联盟”，他又诋毁“最近英法两国发生的事情表示它们满心想和俄国解决问题，恢复更多的贸易”，“意味着……整个反俄军事同盟是软弱的”。
    塔夫脱之流的这些叫嚷，显然是暴露了美国好战分子们不可告人的居心，他们竭力破坏任何一个紧迫的国际问题的和平解决，更加不愿由于朝鲜停战的实现导致其他国际问题的协商解决，以便国际紧张局势仍能继续保持下来。
    事实上，美国好战分子们的这个居心，从中苏两国的和平倡议提出以后，就不断地暴露出来。
    华盛顿“每日新闻”四月四日的报道中，就反映出美国担忧中苏两国的和平倡议，“可能引起连环的反应，改变整个世界局势”。它列举“这时候实现和平会引起下列的可能性”，如“解决朝鲜战争会自然而然地取消联合国对中国的禁运，东西方之间的贸易会活跃起来”；“一个德国和平条约与一个统一的德国可能使美国失去一个盟国”；“仍然只是一个空架子的北大西洋公约组织会处在垮台的危险中”，以及所谓“迅速的灾难性的复员”和
    “经济崩溃”等等。
    在同一天出版的“商业周刊”，也表现了同样的忧虑。它谈到美国在远东和欧洲的侵略政策的各方面，说“假定朝鲜很快地就实现停战，那时西方的问题（按即美国侵略政策所造成的许多问题）将因而发生动摇。”
    因此，四月五日“纽约时报”透露“华盛顿的普遍意见”，就认为“在朝鲜，可能真正获得停战，但是按照美国可以接受的条件，在朝鲜和世界其他地区求得总解决，还是很远的事。”
    显然，所有认为朝鲜实现停战后不能进一步和平解决朝鲜问题，并谋求其他紧迫的国际问题的协商解决的论据，都是站不住脚的。在美国和其他资本主义国家里，正是有这样的一些人，对于他们，拖延国际纠纷或悬案的解决，保持两个阵营间紧张的敌对局面，就是意味着他们可以继续在大批的军事定单中，在向人民日益加重的征税中，保持最大限度的利润。
    然而，世界各国越来越多的人却看到，无论各国的社会制度有着怎样的不同，但是取得和平以及发展各国人民在贸易、经济和文化各方面的合作，是完全可能的；这样做是符合各国的利益的，也包括美国的利益在内，如果美国愿意这样做的话。
    因而，目前正在广泛的国际人士中间开展的促进大国协商解决国际争端的和平努力，将因朝鲜问题的和平解决的进展而得到鼓舞，信心百倍地去克服一切障碍，争取更大的胜利。这个日益强大的和平运动，过去已经证明、今后也将证明是没有任何的反动势力所能阻挡的。
