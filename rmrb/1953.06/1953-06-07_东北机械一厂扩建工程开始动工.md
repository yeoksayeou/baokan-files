Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 6th. One of the key construction projects of China's machinery industry, the expansion project of Northeast Machinery Factory No. 1, is now stepping up its preparation work, and some projects have already started construction. After the expansion, this factory will become one of the largest machine tool manufacturing plants in China, producing various state-of-the-art machine tools. Its future production capacity will be nearly six times higher than its current capacity.

The factory already has nine workshops for metal processing, casting, forging, and tools. However, most of the equipment is old-fashioned belt-driven lathes, resulting in low production efficiency and poor working conditions for the workers. According to the expansion plan, in addition to renovating the existing workshops, several new workshops and auxiliary departments will be built. Each workshop will be equipped with various state-of-the-art machine tools from the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, and the German Democratic Republic. Even the casting workshop, which currently relies on manual production methods, will implement mechanized production in most processes in the future, using molding machines, sandblasting machines, and other equipment. In terms of transportation, mechanical handling equipment such as cranes, trolleys, conveyor belts, and roller belts will be used to replace manual labor from the time materials enter the factory until the finished products leave the factory. Each workshop will have facilities such as changing rooms, showers, and toilets. Ventilation and heating equipment will also be excellent, ensuring that the workshops always have fresh air and a suitable temperature. A large area of trees and flowers will be planted on the open space within the factory to make the environment more beautiful.

The expansion project of this factory is scheduled to be completed in 1955. This year, the main focus is on the renovation of some workshops and the construction of new substations and water towers, as well as the installation of hundreds of machines. Currently, various construction workers have been largely equipped, and some temporary housing has been built. Most of the construction materials such as steel, cement, and wood have also been transported to the site. Engineers and technicians are busy proofreading construction drawings and actively collecting data to compile construction organization plans. The substation project has recently commenced. Other projects will also start construction successively in June and July.

    东北机械一厂扩建工程开始动工
    【新华社沈阳六日电】我国机械工业建设重点工程之一——东北机械一厂扩建工程，现在正在加紧进行准备工作，部分工程已经开始动工。这个工厂在扩建以后，将成为我国规模最大的工作母机制造厂之一，生产各种最新式的机床。将来生产能力要比现在高出将近六倍。
    这个工厂原来已有金属加工、铸工、锻工、工具等九个车间。但大部分的设备都是旧式的皮带床子，生产效率不高，工人的劳动条件也不好。按照扩建计划，除了把现有的车间加以改建外，还要再新建起几个车间和辅助部门。在每个车间里都要安装苏联、捷克斯洛伐克和德意志民主共和国的各种最新式的机床，就是现在还用手工方式生产的铸工车间，将来也要在大部分工序上实行机械化生产，使用造型机、铲刺机、喷砂机等。在运输上，从材料入厂一直到成品出厂，都将要用吊车、推车、传送带、滚轴带等机械搬运设备来代替工人们的体力劳动。每个车间都将有更衣室、淋浴室、厕所等设施。通风、取暖设备也很好，车间里能够经常保持空气新鲜，温度适宜。在厂内的空地上，并将大片地种上树木花草，使环境改变得更加美丽。
    这个工厂的扩建工程，计划在一九五五年全部完成。今年主要是进行部分车间的改建工程和变电所、水塔的新建工程，以及安装数百台机器。现在，各种建筑工人都已大致配备齐全，一些暂设房屋已经修建起来。各种建筑用的材料如钢材、水泥、木材等也已经大部分运到现场。工程师和技术人员正在忙着校对施工图纸，积极搜集资料编制施工组织计划。变电所工程已在最近开工。其他各项工程也将在六、七月里陆续开工。
