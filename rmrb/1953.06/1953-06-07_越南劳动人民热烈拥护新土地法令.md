    Xinhua News Agency, June 6th: According to Vietnam News Agency, people from all walks of life in Vietnam warmly support the Vietnamese Labor Party's decision to vigorously mobilize the peasant masses to implement the land policy and the new land law promulgated by the Vietnamese government. Labor models, combat heroes, and peasants from various regions have written letters to President Ho Chi Minh or published articles in newspapers, expressing their gratitude to President Ho Chi Minh, the Labor Party, and the government for their wise decisions, and unanimously expressing their willingness to actively participate in this great mass movement. Huang Heng, a nationally renowned agricultural labor model in Vietnam, wrote in a letter to President Ho Chi Minh: Under the past colonial and feudal systems, we were very poor despite working hard all year round. Now, I have a brick house, a brick-paved yard, a lot of food, and livestock and poultry. My children are also going to school. Not only has my family's life improved, but the lives of many other families have also improved. This year, the Labor Party and the government under your leadership decided to launch a mass mobilization movement and implement the new land law to develop production and strive for the complete victory of the resistance war. We are determined to actively participate in this movement in accordance with your instructions.
