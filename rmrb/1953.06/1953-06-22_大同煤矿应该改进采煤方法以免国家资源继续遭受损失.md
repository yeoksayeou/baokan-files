    Datong Coal Mine Should Improve Mining Methods to Avoid Continued Loss of National Resources
    Zhang Qingnian and Dong Shouwei wrote: Some coal seams in the No. 2 and No. 3 mines of the Datong Mining Bureau are more than three meters thick. However, when they are currently mined, thirty centimeters are left on the bottom plate and more than one meter thick is left on the top plate. The actual mining is less than two meters, and the total recovery rate is less than 60%. The remaining coal seams are completely buried when the roof is released. Such a waste of coal seams is twice as thick as some coal mines in Shandong that are currently being mined. The reason for the above serious waste of national resources is that some leading cadres and technicians of the coal mine are afraid of difficulties, and therefore emphasize that "there is no experience in layered mining" and are afraid of "problems." They have adopted a practice that only considers the immediate interests of their own unit, regardless of the long-term interests of the country.
    Our country has made great progress in coal mining in the past three years. If the problem of layered mining to improve the actual mining volume is studied by coal miners, it can be completely solved. Fengfeng, Yangquan and other mines have gained experience in this regard. It is recommended that the Datong Mining Bureau quickly improve mining methods to avoid continued loss of national resources.

### 大同煤矿应该改进采煤方法以免国家资源继续遭受损失

    大同煤矿应该改进采煤方法以免国家资源继续遭受损失
    张庆年、董守维来信：大同矿务局二、三矿某些煤层厚达三公尺余，而他们现在开采时底板留下三十公分，顶板留下一公尺多厚，实采的还不到二公尺，总回收率不到百分之六十；其余煤层在放顶时就被全部埋掉了。这样糟蹋的煤层，比山东某些正在开采的煤矿的煤层还要厚一倍。发生以上严重浪费国家资源情况的原因是：煤矿某些领导干部和技术人员怕困难，因而强调“分层采煤没有经验”，怕“出问题”，采取了只顾本单位的眼前利益，不管国家长远利益的做法。
    我国在过去三年中采煤工作有很大进步，像分层采煤以提高实采量的问题，如果发动采煤人员加以研究，是完全可以解决的。峰峰、阳泉等矿在这方面已经取得了经验。建议大同矿务局从速改进采煤方法，以免国家资源继续受到损失。
