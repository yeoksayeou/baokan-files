Reader Letters Abstract

Improve Leadership Methods to Overcome the "Five Excesses" Phenomenon

Editor's Note: In order to make production truly the central task that overrides everything else in rural areas, it is necessary to overcome the current "five excesses" phenomenon in rural work: too many tasks, too many meetings and training sessions, too many official documents, reports, and forms, too many organizations, and too many concurrent posts for activists. Leading organs in many areas have already begun to pay attention to solving this problem; however, the "five excesses" phenomenon still exists in some rural work, causing difficulties for lower-level cadres and affecting farmers' production. We are now publishing a selection of reader letters exposing the "five excesses" phenomenon in abstract form, hoping that leading organs in various regions will quickly inspect and correct bureaucraticism and decentralism in leadership work, improve leadership methods, and effectively overcome the "five excesses" phenomenon.

People's Government of Pingquan County, Rehe Province

The Practice of Covertly Issuing Excessive Reports Should Be Corrected

Reader Zheng Yun from the Fourth District of Pingquan County, Rehe Province, writes: County Head Liu of Pingquan County (Note: the name was not specified in the letter) expressed his determination at the beginning of February at a district head joint meeting to correct the "five excesses" phenomenon in district and village work; however, the "five excesses" phenomenon has not been corrected to this day. Taking the issue of "excessive report issuance" as an example, on the surface, the county has paid attention to it, and fewer forms and reports are being issued than in the past; but the actual situation has not changed, and the county has simply replaced public report issuance with covert report issuance methods.

One method is not to distribute the forms and reports downwards but to have district cadres fill them out and submit them when they come to the county for meetings. For example, when the county held a people's representative meeting of all sectors on February 22, the county people's government issued spring plowing preparation survey forms, drought resistance and moisture conservation survey forms, disaster survey forms, and water conservancy forms, requiring district cadres to fill them out and leave them in the county during the meeting. Another example is the joint meeting of county party committee secretaries and district heads on March 28, where the county party committee office issued four types of forms for the districts to fill out, and office cadres were assigned to supervise the districts in filling out the forms. Some districts could not fill them out at that time, and Comrade Li Shirui, the secretary of the county committee, said: "These forms are absolutely not allowed to be distributed downwards. This is just for show, so fill them out!"

Another method is to formulate report outlines in the form of reports and forms, requiring the districts to report accordingly. For example, on April 23, the county people's government issued an outline for reporting on spring plowing production, requiring each district to report to the county according to this outline before the end of April. This outline is divided into seven items: drought resistance and moisture conservation, fertilizer, seeds, spring plowing, soil improvement, bumper harvest competition, and tree planting, each with complex and detailed sub-items requiring detailed figures. Taking the item of drought resistance and moisture conservation as an example: "How many new canals have you district opened? How many old canals have been restored? How many mu of land have been irrigated by each? How many mu of land have been irrigated with frozen water? How many new wells and restored old wells have been dug? How many mu of land have been irrigated by each? How many new and old springs have been dug? How many mu of land have been irrigated by each? How many mu of dry land have been irrigated once, twice, three times, and four times? How many mu of waterlogged land have been irrigated once, twice, three times, and four times? How many mu have been cleared of stones? How many mu have been planted by water seeding? How many mu have been planted with wet manure? How many mu have been planted using other drought resistance methods? How many waterwheels does your district have in total? How many of them are newly borrowed? How many have not been installed or utilized?" There are so many sub-items; the other six items are similar. A few days later, the county people's government issued a supplementary notice, saying that the report outline had omitted the content of mutual aid and cooperation, and added a large string of questions, requiring the districts to report together. After the "outline" was issued to the districts, the districts had no choice but to issue it to the villages in the same way. The villages were busy with drought resistance and sowing at that time and had to take time out to collect statistics. Some cadres said: "What 'outline,' it's not the same as a form; it's even clearer to look at a survey form!"

Cadre Zhang Erzhu of Dongwenzhuang Village, Taiyuan City

Urgently Requesting a Solution to the Problem of Too Many Concurrent Posts

Zhang Erzhu (written by Xiuqing) of Dongwenzhuang Village, Seventh District, Taiyuan City, Shanxi Province, writes: I have been a village cadre for four or five years, and the number of concurrent posts has increased year by year; now I hold seventeen or eighteen positions, and I am busy with endless meetings and talks, unable to take care of production, and my life has become a problem. The positions I currently hold are: director of the agricultural production cooperative, chairman of Dongwenzhuang natural village, director of the literacy campaign committee, secretary of the party branch of Xiwenzhuang administrative village, chairman of the people's representative meeting of all sectors, militia instructor, president of the China-Soviet Friendship Association, director of the supervisory committee of the credit cooperative, director of the water conservancy committee, deputy director of three agricultural technology teaching stations, government member of the Seventh District, consultative member, and people's representative, and people's representative of Taiyuan City. In addition, I was also selected as a model worker in water conservancy in my village.

With so many positions, there are also more meetings. Not to mention the regular meetings, when a task is assigned, I first go to the district to attend a meeting, then to the administrative village to attend a meeting; after returning to the natural village, I first have a meeting with the cadres, then a meeting with the masses. In addition, for each task, the higher authorities must write summaries and reports..., and a large number of tasks are assigned at one time, which keeps me very busy. Also, last year our village was a model village, and cadres from all levels and systems of the province, city, and district often came to visit and always looked for me, which was really overwhelming. Although I am a cadre who does not leave production, I don't even have time to go to the fields.

Last year I participated in the mutual aid team, but I rarely participated in production; as a result, after settling accounts, I owed people forty-five workdays, totaling three hundred and sixty catties of millet. I thought this would not work, so I reported it to the higher authorities; the higher authorities said, "Let's solve it slowly," but it has not been solved until now (the end of April). This year I joined the agricultural production cooperative, and others have already recorded seventy or eighty workdays, but I have only recorded seven or eight workdays. I have not yet paid back the wages and rice I owed last year, and I will have to owe money again this year, and I will starve if this continues.

I have a firm idea to serve the people, but it is also impossible if life becomes a problem. Now some local leading organs have begun to solve the problem of "five excesses" in rural areas, which is really a good thing; I hope that the party and government leading organs here will also do so quickly.

Production Office of Yi'an County, Heilongjiang

Disregarding the System and Randomly Requesting Investigative Materials

Zang Jingqi of the Fourth District Committee of the Communist Party of China in Yi'an County, Heilongjiang Province, writes: The production office of Yi'an County still has the bad practice of randomly requesting materials from lower levels. The office originally stipulated that each district's production assistant should report on the production situation every Monday; however, sometimes it would temporarily and randomly request materials from the district production assistants. For example, on May 1, the county production office called my district's production assistant at 4:00 PM, asking him to report eight types of materials before 5:00 PM. (Note: the content of the materials was not specified in the letter) It is worth noting that these eight types of materials had not been notified in advance, and each district could not investigate them clearly within an hour. My district's production assistant raised an objection, but the production office still insisted on having them, forcing the production assistant to say, "Then I can only write a false report!"

A Bureaucratic Survey Form

Inspection Team of the Propaganda Department of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China writes: We found a "Statistical Table for Investigating the Types of Marriage Law Implementation" issued by the Shijiazhuang Special District Office for the Implementation of the Marriage Law in the Propaganda Department of the Zhengding County Committee. The complexity and intricacy of this statistical table are truly astonishing. The survey time of the survey table ranges from 1934 to February 1953 (divided into seven stages), lasting more than nineteen years. The survey content is divided into four major categories, each with many sub-items. For example, "Marriage Types" include: arranged marriage, buying and selling marriage, disguised buying and selling marriage, child bride, milk bride, bigamy, early marriage, divorce, widow marriage, semi-autonomous, autonomous; "Illegal Discipline Violations" include: abortion, infanticide, greedy matchmakers, forced self-injury, forced suicide, injury, murder, abuse (divided into abuse by husband, abuse by parents-in-law, abuse by "peers"). In addition, it is also necessary to investigate the current total number of mu of land in the village, the number of households, the number of men and women, and even the number of widows and bachelors; and the survey of the number of men and women and the number of bachelors and widows must also be divided into three categories: young, middle-aged, and elderly.

According to comrades from the Propaganda Department of the Zhengding County Committee of the Communist Party of China: This form was issued four or five days before the Spring Festival, asking them to investigate three typical villages; they reported to the Special District Office for the Implementation of the Marriage Law that the content of this form was too complicated and difficult to investigate; but the reply they received was "it's still good to investigate it." They had to send two comrades to investigate in Xiguan. The masses reflected:

"You are managing too much, managing things from ten or twenty years ago." "Some people died long ago, so how can we investigate?" Some cadres said: "There is really no way to investigate, if the higher authorities insist on investigating, we can only fill it out casually and report it."

We believe that the bureaucracy and formalism of the Shijiazhuang Special District Office for the Implementation of the Marriage Law are serious. They probably don't even know what the purpose of doing such an investigation is. Judging from its content, it is also inconsistent with the spirit of the Marriage Law implementation campaign. Although the Marriage Law implementation campaign has ended, in order to oppose the "five excesses" phenomenon in rural work, we believe it is still necessary to expose this matter to attract everyone's attention.

Farmers of Baixiang Town, Yueqing County, Zhejiang

Opinions on Improving Leadership of Production Work

Reader Wang Deba from Yueqing County, Zhejiang Province, writes: In order to improve the working methods of leading agricultural production, the cadres of Baixiang Town, Yueqing County, recently held two farmers' symposiums during production breaks, asking farmers for advice on how to lead agricultural production during the busy farming season. The farmers put forward many valuable opinions.

First of all, the farmers put forward opinions and methods to correct the problem of holding meetings randomly during the busy farming season. For example, farmer Xue Dasong from Chetou Village said: "Now meetings should be held less during the busy farming season, and the old-fashioned meetings should not be held; meetings should be short, focusing on the center, clear and refreshing, and solving problems in a few words. Some things do not need to be solved by sitting down and holding meetings, so as not to waste time waiting for you and waiting for him. Now everyone always goes to the village head to stand after dinner, and it is best for comrades to go to the village head at this time, and talk to everyone if they have something to say; in this way, more people will come, and everyone will listen."

Secondly, the farmers also asked the cadres not to sit in the room and wait for the farmers, but to go deep into the fields to find the farmers. For example, farmer Ye Yanbiao said:

"Everyone is in the fields all day during the busy farming season, and comrades sitting in the room cannot meet anyone, so it is best to go to the fields more often, and our production enthusiasm will be much better. However, when going to the fields, do not only look for village cadres, but should walk around everywhere. If you find any problems, you can point them out on the spot; if you find that someone has difficulties, you can also find ways to help them."

Regarding the promotion of advanced experience, the farmers all asked the cadres to cultivate typical examples and set examples for everyone. Farmer Xue Ridao said: "This year, we are promoting the new experience of 'small-plant dense planting'. Everyone has heard about its benefits, but they have not planted it before and do not know how to plant it well. It is best for comrades to help labor models or experienced old farmers plant one mu of land at the roadside a few days in advance for everyone to see, so that everyone can plant in the same way. Some people who did not want to do this before may learn from the fields of labor models and old farmers." Farmer Xue Dakang said: "If the examples are done well, and the comrades talk at the head of the field, with real names and surnames and with specific locations, everyone will see it and it will 'fall into their stomachs,' which is much better than talking at meetings."

In addition, the farmers also asked the cadres to discover new problems in their work at any time and solve them. For example, the "small-plant dense planting" requires more effort, and the mutual aid group scoring and the wages of "planting guests" should be appropriately increased,

otherwise the promotion work will encounter obstacles.

The cadres of Baixiang Town are determined to accept the farmers' opinions and effectively improve their work style.

    读者来信摘要
    改进领导方法克服“五多”现象
    编者按：为了使生产能够真正成为农村压倒一切的中心任务，就必须克服目前农村工作中任务多、会议集训多、公文报告表册多、组织多、积极分子兼职多的“五多”现象。不少地区的领导机关已经开始注意解决这个问题；但有一些农村工作中“五多”现象仍然存在，致使下级干部的工作发生困难并影响农民生产。现在我们把读者揭发“五多”现象的来信选择一部分摘要发表于后，希望各地领导机关迅速检查并纠正领导工作中的官僚主义和分散主义，改进领导方法，以切实克服“五多”现象。热河平泉县人民政府
    应纠正变相滥发表报的做法
    热河省平泉县第四区读者郑云来信：平泉县刘县长（按：来信未写明名字）在二月初区长联席会议上曾向大家表示了纠正区村工作中“五多”现象的决心；但是至今“五多”现象并没有纠正。光拿“滥发表报”这个问题来说吧，表面上县里是注意了，发的表报比过去少；但实际情况却并没有改变，只不过县里用变相发表报的办法代替了公开发表报的办法。
    一个办法是不把表报往下发，而等区干部上县里开会时让他们现填现交。如二月二十二日开县各界人民代表会议时，县人民政府就拿出春耕准备调查表、抗旱保墒调查表、灾情调查表、水利表等让各区干部填，并要在会议期间填好留县。又如三月二十八日全县区委书记、区长联席会议上，县委办公室发下四种表格让各区填，办公室干部还分工督促各区填表。有的区当时填不上，县委会秘书李士瑞同志还说：“这表根本不准往下发。这是面子事，给填填吧！”
    另一个办法是制订表报式的汇报提纲，让各区按此上报。譬如四月二十三日县人民政府发下春耕生产汇报提纲，要各区按此在四月底以前向县汇报。这个提纲分抗旱保墒、肥料、种籽、春耕、改良土壤、丰产竞赛运动、植树等七项，每项又有繁复的、需要详细数字的小项目。以抗旱保墒一项为例：“你区开新渠多少？恢复旧渠几道？各浇多少亩地？用冻水浇多少亩地？打新井、恢复旧井各多少眼？各浇多少亩地？挖新旧水泉子各多少个？各浇多少亩地？干地浇一遍、二遍、三遍、四遍的各多少亩？涝地浇一遍、二遍、三遍、四遍的各多少亩？搂石头多少亩？坐水种地的多少亩？拌湿粪的多少亩？用其它抗旱办法种地的多少亩？你区共有多少台水车？其中有多少是新贷的？有多少台没安装上或未利用？”就有这许多小项目；其它六项也差不多。过了几天，县人民政府又发下一个补充通知，说是汇报提纲还遗漏了互助合作方面的内容，又添了一大串题目，让各区一并汇报。“提纲”发到区后，区里没有办法，只得照样发下去让村里汇报。各村当时正忙着抗旱播种，只得抽时间统计。有的干部说：“什么‘提纲’，和表格还不是一个样；还不如调查表格看得清楚呢！”太原市东温庄村干部张二柱
    迫切要求解决兼职多的问题
    山西太原市七区东温庄张二柱（秀卿代笔）来信：我担任村干部已经四五年了，兼职一年比一年多；现在我兼了十七、八个职务，整天开会、谈话忙不完，生产顾不上，生活成了问题。我现在担任的职务有：农业生产合作社主任、东温庄自然村主席和扫除文盲委员会主任、西温庄行政村党支部书记、各界人民代表会议主席、民兵指导员、中苏友协会长、信用合作社监察主任、水利委员会主任和三个农业技术传授站的副站长，七区的政府委员、协商委员和人民代表，太原市的人民代表。此外，我还被选为本村的水利劳动模范。
    职务多，开的会也就多了。经常的会不说，一个工作布置下来时，我先到区里开会，再到行政村开会；回到自然村后先和干部开会，再和群众开会。加上每种工作上级都要写总结、汇报……，而在一个时期工作又布置了一大堆，把我忙死了。还有，去年我村是个模范村，省、市、区各级各系统的干部经常来，一来就找我，实在应付不了。我虽是一个不脱离生产的干部，但连下地时间都没有了。
    去年我参加互助组，但很少参加生产；结果一算账，脱下人家四十五个工，共折三百六十斤小米。我想这样下去不行，就向上级反映；上级说是“慢慢解决吧”，但到现在（四月底）也不解决。今年我入了农业生产合作社，别人都已记了七、八十个工，我才记了七、八个工。去年拉下的工资米没还，今年又得欠账，这样下去我非挨饿不行。
    我有坚定的思想要为人民办事，但生活成问题也是不行。现在有些地方的领导机关已开始解决农村中“五多”问题，这真是一件好事情；希望我们这里的党政领导机关赶快也这样做。黑龙江依安县生产办公室
    不遵守制度乱要调查材料
    中共黑龙江省依安县第四区委员会臧景祺来信：依安县生产办公室至今还有着随便向下级要材料的不良做法。该室原规定各区生产助理员在每星期一汇报生产情况；但有时却又临时向区生产助理员乱要材料。如五月一日县生产办公室在下午四点钟打电话给我区生产助理员，要他在五点钟以前报去八种材料。（按：来信未说明材料内容）值得注意的是，这八种材料在事先并没通知过，各区在一小时内根本无法调查清楚。我区生产助理员提出意见，生产办公室还是非要不可，逼得生产助理员说：“那只有写假报告才行了！”
    一张官僚主义的调查表
    中共河北省委员会宣传部检查组来信：我们在正定县委宣传部发现一张石家庄专区贯彻婚姻法办公室发下的“调查贯彻婚姻法类型统计表”。这张统计表的繁琐、复杂程度，实在令人惊讶。调查表的调查时间从一九三四年到一九五三年二月（其中分为七个阶段），达十九年多。调查内容分四大类，每类又有很多小项目。如“婚姻类型”包括：包办、买卖、变相买卖、童养媳、奶媳、重婚、早婚、离婚、寡妇结婚、半自主、自主；“违法乱纪类”，包括：打胎、溺婴、贪钱媒婆、被逼自伤、被逼自杀、被伤、被杀、受虐待（内分受丈夫虐待、受公婆虐待、受“同辈”虐待）。此外，还要调查目前全村的土地亩数、户口数、男女人口数甚至寡妇和光棍的人数；而有关男女人口和光棍、寡妇人数的调查中还要分青年、壮年和老年三类。
    据中共正定县委宣传部同志谈：这个表是春节前四、五天发下的，要他们调查三个典型村；他们曾向专区贯彻婚姻法办公室反映这个表内容太复杂，不好调查；但得到的答复是“还是调查一下好”。他们只得派两个同志到西关调查。群众反映说：
    “你们管得太宽了，管到一、二十年前的事。”“有的人早死了，那怎么调查呢？”有的干部说：“真没法调查，如果上级硬要调查，我们只能随便填一下报上去。”
    我们认为石家庄专区贯彻婚姻法办公室的官僚主义和形式主义是严重的。他们要做这样一个调查的目的是什么，恐怕自己也弄不清楚。就其调查内容来看，和贯彻婚姻法运动的精神也是不符的。贯彻婚姻法运动虽然已经结束了，但是为了反对农村工作中的“五多”现象，我们认为还有揭发这件事以引起大家注意的必要。浙江乐清县白象镇农民
    对改进领导生产工作的意见
    浙江省乐清县读者汪德霸来信：清乐县白象镇的干部们为了改进领导农业生产的工作方法，最近在生产间隙开了两次农民座谈会，向农民们请教在农忙时节怎样领导农业生产的问题。农民们提出了不少宝贵的意见。
    首先，农民们提出了纠正在农忙时乱开会的意见和办法。如车头村农民薛大松说：“现在农忙时节会要少开，老一套的会就不要开；开会要短，抓住中心，清清爽爽，几句话就解决问题。有些事情就不必坐起来开会解决，免得你等我，我等他，时间白白等掉了。现在大家吃了晚饭总要到村头站站，同志们最好在这时到村头去，有话就向大家讲讲；这样人到得多，大家也听得进去。”
    其次，农民们又要求干部们不要坐在屋里等农民，而要深入田间去找农民。如农民叶岩标说：
    “农忙时大家整天在田里，同志们坐在屋里谁也碰不到，最好多到田里去转转，我们生产兴头也会好得多。不过到田里去时不要专找村干部，应该到处走动走动。发现有什么问题，当场就可以指点；发现谁有困难，也可以设法帮助解决。”
    对推广先进经验方面，农民们都要求干部培养典型，给大家做样子。农民薛日滔说：“今年推广 ‘小株密植’这个新经验，它的好处大家已经听熟了，就是没有插过，不知怎样插好。同志们最好早几天就帮助劳动模范或者有经验的老农民在路头先插上一亩田让大家看看，使大家也能照样插。有些原先不想这样做的人看了劳动模范和老农民的田也许就会学样了。”农民薛大康说：“样子做好了，同志们在田头一讲，有真姓实名，有确实地点，大家看到就会‘落肚’，比开会讲好得多。”
    此外，农民们还要求干部们随时发现工作中的新问题，加以解决。如“小株密植”插田用的工夫多、互助组评分和“插田客”工资就要适当提高，
    否则推广工作就会遇到阻碍。
    白象镇的干部们决心接受农民们的意见，切实改进工作作风。
