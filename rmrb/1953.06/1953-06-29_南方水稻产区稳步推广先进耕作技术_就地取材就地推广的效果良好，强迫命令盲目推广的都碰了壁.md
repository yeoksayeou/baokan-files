Advanced Farming Techniques Steadily Promoted in Southern Rice Producing Areas

Local materials and methods are effective, while forced and blindly promoted methods have failed.

The transplanting of early, mid-season, and late rice crops has been completed in the southern rice-producing areas. In some regions of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, and Sichuan provinces, after summarizing the previous stage of promoting "saltwater (muddy water) seed selection" and "sparse seedling" cultivation methods, advanced cultivation techniques such as "close planting of small seedlings" and "rational fertilization" have been further promoted using methods such as typical demonstrations and actual case comparisons. The CPC Songjiang County Committee in Jiangsu Province used the "typical chain demonstration" method to promote Chen Yongkang's advanced experience, prompting more than 8,700 farmers to adopt advanced farming techniques. Certain areas of Zhejiang Province have also achieved certain results in promoting dense planting of rice this year. Most areas in Sichuan Province have implemented advanced cultivation methods such as "less seedlings and dense planting" and "rational fertilization" (applying base fertilizer) to varying degrees this year. In Yibin County, Sichuan Province, where rice seedlings have already been transplanted, 50% to 80% of farmers have implemented dense planting and applied more base fertilizer.

In the process of promoting advanced experience, many places have adopted the method of typical demonstrations. Songjiang County in Jiangsu Province has established 24 demonstration centers and 81 township demonstration sub-stations throughout the county, and has identified 25 advanced mutual aid groups as demonstration groups for the central stations and 104 mutual aid groups as demonstration groups for the township sub-stations. In addition, 431 villages have established village demonstration groups. When promoting the "small seedling square dense planting" method in Mao Shu Township, Kunshan County, Jiangsu Province, two or three plots of land of the same size were set aside in each village. Local people who used the old method of transplanting rice seedlings and those who used the "dense planting" method last year each used their own method to transplant a portion of the field with rice straw stalks. Then, the masses were mobilized to count the number of seedlings, row spacing, and plant spacing to study which method was appropriate. They also convened small technical research meetings in units of two or three villages, inviting farmers who had adopted appropriate dense planting methods last year and farmers who still used sparse planting methods to introduce the different results of the two planting methods, and then asked everyone to analyze and study them.

In this promotion of close planting of small seedlings, various localities also mastered the methods of using local materials and promoting them locally. In order to teach the correct working methods of promoting advanced technology to rural cadres throughout the county and to correct the past tendency of blindly copying the experience of other places, the CPC Xiaoshan County Committee in Zhejiang Province sent a working group to Henanwang Village in Chengbei District, the county's highest rice-producing area last year, in mid-April to help local farmers summarize their high-yield experience. They found that local farmers had a lot of high-yield experience. For example, regarding seedling fields, there is a farmer's saying: "One shoulder six sheng" (one shoulder is about 0.085 mu of field, that is, six sheng of late rice seeds are sown on one shoulder of field, and the sowing is relatively sparse). Another example, regarding transplanting, there is a farmer's saying: "Fine, tight, and dense, square connection circle" (that is, the number of seedlings per cluster should be small, the distance should be tight, and the density should be such that a small bucket of six inches square can be placed between the four clusters of seedlings). These farmers' sayings are in line with advanced farming techniques such as "sparse seeding" and "close planting of small square seedlings," but they have not been seriously summarized in the past, so only a few experienced farmers are currently using them. The working group of the CPC Xiaoshan County Committee also summarized the local farmers' experience in preventing rice stalk lodging and rational fertilization, and further organized the masses to study and promote these experiences. In the process of summarizing the experience of the masses, various localities have found many typical examples of dense planting resulting in high yields every year and sparse planting resulting in poor harvests every season. For example, Huang Kaitai, a farmer in Wenwu Village, Dipeng Township, Second District, Jiang'an County, Sichuan Province, nicknamed "Huang Dense Grain," has been practicing dense planting for decades. His family has passed down an old saying for generations: "Thousands of beards are not as good as ten thousand hangers." His planting method is seven inches square, and he plants four or five fewer seedlings per nest (plant) than the average farmer. Last year, his 1.8 mu of land yielded 1,120 jin of rice, 30% more than the average farmer. Another example is Wang Dexuan, a farmer in Sili Township, Second District, Xuyong County, Sichuan Province, nicknamed "Wang Dense Slag." Since he separated from his brother Wang Chuntian (nicknamed "Sparse Throw") in 1935, he has been practicing dense planting every year and has reaped a bumper harvest every year. His brother has been practicing sparse planting every year and has reaped a poor harvest every season. Using these facts as propaganda materials has effectively promoted the "less seedlings and dense planting" technology.

In the promotion of advanced cultivation techniques of "close planting of small seedlings," some cadres have neglected the method of patient persuasion and used administrative orders to force the masses to adopt new technologies. For example, in some areas of Changning, Fushun, Hongxian, Rongxian, Gaoxian, Nanxi, and Jiangjin counties in Sichuan Province, some cadres who lead production have had the phenomenon of forced orders when promoting "less seedlings and dense planting." They do not explain the benefits of "less seedlings and dense planting" well to the masses and let the masses accept them voluntarily; nor do they gradually promote advanced experience through specific cases that already exist among the masses, but demand uniformity and force farmers to implement "less seedlings and dense planting." When promoting "close planting of small seedlings," cadres in Tongcun Township, Kaihua County, Zhejiang Province, did not distinguish between regions or look at specific conditions, and universally called for the implementation of close planting of small seedlings of six inches square, blindly setting a plan to increase production by 90% throughout the township. Many farmers did not accept it, and the cadres said that the masses were "conservative," "stubborn," and "unpromising." When farmers in Shangtan District, Xuanping County, Zhejiang Province, transplanted rice seedlings, some cadres monitored them in the fields. If the transplanting did not meet the dense planting standards, they asked the masses to replant. This caused dissatisfaction among the masses, and the advanced experience of "less seedlings and dense planting" was not truly promoted. In addition, when some regions promoted and popularized this advanced cultivation method, they erroneously emphasized "dense planting" and ignored "less seedlings." Therefore, the tendency of "more seedlings and dense planting" arose. For example, among the farmers who have already transplanted seedlings in Rongchang County, Sichuan Province, many farmers plant seedlings with a plant spacing of eight or nine inches and 28 to 30 seedlings per nest. This kind of work style of blindly promoting without first understanding the advanced experience should also be corrected.

    南方水稻产区稳步推广先进耕作技术
    就地取材就地推广的效果良好，强迫命令盲目推广的都碰了壁
    南方水稻产区的早、中、晚稻都已插秧完毕。江苏、浙江、安徽、四川等省的部分地区，在总结前一阶段推广“盐水（泥水）选种”和“落谷稀”栽培法的基础上，采用典型示范和实际事例对比等办法，进一步推广了“小株密植”“合理施肥”等先进栽培技术。中共江苏省松江县委运用“典型连环示范”方法，推广陈永康先进经验，推动了八千七百多户农民采用了先进耕作技术。浙江省若干地区今年在推广水稻密植方面也有一定的成绩。四川省各地今年大都不同程度地实行了“少秧密栽”“合理施肥”（施底肥）等先进耕作方法。四川宜宾县已栽秧的地方，百分之五十至八十的农民已实行密栽并多下底肥。
    在推广先进经验的过程中，有不少地方采用了典型示范的方法。江苏省松江县全县建立了二十四个示范中心站、八十一个乡示范分站，确定了二十五个先进互助组为中心站的示范组，一百零四个互助组为乡分站的示范组。此外并有四百三十一个村建立了村示范组。江苏省昆山县毛竖乡在推广“小株方形密植”栽秧法时，在每个村中辟出同等大小的田地二、三块，由本地采用旧方法栽秧的人和去年采用“密植”方法栽秧的人，各以自己的栽秧法，用稻草秆各插一分田，然后发动群众一起数棵数、株行距，研究那一种为宜；他们并以二、三个村为单位，召开小型技术研究会，由去年曾经采用适当密植方法的农民和仍用稀植方法的农民来介绍二种栽法的不同结果，再请大家分析研究。
    各地在这次推广水稻小株密植中，还掌握了就地取材、就地推广的方法。中共浙江萧山县委为了把正确的推广先进技术的工作方法教给全县农村工作干部，纠正过去一度产生的盲目硬搬外地经验的偏向，于四月中旬派出工作组，到去年该县水稻产量最高的城北区河南王村，帮助当地农民总结丰产经验。他们发现当地农民有很多丰产经验，例如，关于秧田，有一句农谚是“一肩六升”（一肩约合八厘五毫田，即一肩田播六升晚稻谷种，播种较稀）；又如，关于插秧，有一句农谚是：“细紧细密，斗方连圈”（即每丛的株数宜少，距离要紧密，密度以在四丛秧之间能放得下一只六寸见方的小斗为宜），这些农谚正符合“落谷稀”、“小株方形密植”等先进耕作技术，只是过去没有认真总结过，所以目前只有少数有经验的农民在采用。中共萧山县委工作组又总结了当地农民防止稻秆倒伏及合理施肥等经验，并进一步组织群众研究学习和推广这些经验。各地在总结群众经验中，找出了很多密栽年年丰产，稀栽季季歉收的典型事例。如四川江安县二区底蓬乡文武村农民黄开泰，绰号“黄密纳”，他家几十年一直实行密栽的办法，几辈人栽秧传下一句老话是：“千须须不如万吊吊”。他的栽秧法是七寸见方，每窝（棵）比一般农民少栽四、五株。去年他的一亩八分田打了一千一百二十斤稻谷，比一般农民多收三成。又如四川省叙永县二区撕栗乡农民王德宣，绰号“王密楂”，他自从一九三五年和他的哥哥王春田（外号叫“稀稀甩”）分家后，年年密栽，年年丰收；他的哥哥每年稀栽，季季歉收。用这些事实作宣传材料，有力地推动了“少秧密栽”技术的推广。
    在推广“小株密植”的先进栽培技术方面，还有一些干部忽视耐心说服的方法，而用行政命令的方法，强迫群众采用新技术。如四川省长宁、富顺、洪县、荣县、高县、南溪、江津等县部分地区，有些领导生产的干部，在推广“少秧密栽”时就曾发生强迫命令的现象。他们不很好地向群众说明“少秧密栽”的好处，让群众自愿接受；又不通过群众中已有的具体事例逐步推广先进经验，而强求划一，硬要农民实行“少秧密栽”。浙江省开化县桐村乡干部在推广“小株密植”时，不分地区，不看具体条件，就普遍号召实行六寸见方的小株密植，盲目订出全乡增产九成的计划。许多农民不接受，干部就说群众“保守”、“顽固”、“没出息”。浙江省宣平县上坦区农民插秧时，有的干部在田头监视，如插得不合密植标准，就叫群众重新插。这样做都引起了群众的不满，“少秧密栽”的先进经验也没有真正得到推广。还有的地区宣传和推广这一先进栽培方法时，错误地强调“密栽”，忽略了“少秧”；因此，就产生了“多秧密栽”的偏向。如四川省荣昌县已栽秧的农民中，不少农民栽的秧子是：株行距八、九寸，每窝二十八株到三十株。这种不先把先进经验弄通就盲目推广的作风，也应当纠正。
