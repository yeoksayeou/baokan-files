Xinhua News Agency, June 2nd: New York dispatch: US rulers are hastily arranging the execution of the Rosenbergs.

    After the US Supreme Court rejected the Rosenbergs' appeal for the third time, the Rosenbergs' defense attorney, Emanuel Bloch, requested the New York Federal Court to overturn the Rosenbergs' death sentence, pointing out that the court's judgment was without factual basis and illegal. Bloch also legally requested that the execution not be carried out during the period of further appeal. However, the US government and judicial authorities disregarded everything in order to quickly kill these two innocent American citizens. On June 1st, the US Court of Appeals announced that it would not rule on the Rosenbergs' appeal. New York Federal Court Judge Kaufman then announced the rejection of the Rosenbergs' request to overturn the death sentence, and barbarically refused to comply with the law to suspend the execution during the appeal period. At the same time, according to US news agencies, US Federal Court Executive Officer Carroll and First Assistant Farley have gone to Sing Sing Prison to make practical arrangements for electrocuting the Rosenbergs.
    This practice of the US rulers, who disregard justice and public opinion and insist on killing innocent people, has aroused protests from more and more upright people. According to the German News Agency, the German-Soviet Friendship Association of the Karl-Marx-Stadt district of the German Democratic Republic, on behalf of its 365,000 members, lodged a protest. One thousand cooperative members, tractor drivers, and agricultural workers in Neubrandenburg also joined the movement to save this peace-loving and kind American couple, holding protest rallies.

    美国统治者匆忙布置杀害罗森堡夫妇
    正直人民愈来愈多地抗议美国统治者的蛮横作法
    【新华社二日讯】纽约消息：美国统治者匆忙布置杀害罗森堡夫妇。
    在美国最高法院第三次拒绝罗森堡夫妇的上诉后，罗森堡夫妇的辩护律师伊曼纽尔·布洛克曾要求纽约联邦法院取消罗森堡夫妇的死刑判决，指出法院的判决毫无事实根据并且是不合法的。布洛克还依法要求在再度上诉期间不得执行判决。但是美国政府与司法当局不顾一切地要赶紧杀害这两个无辜的美国公民。六月一日，美国上诉法院宣布对罗森堡夫妇的上诉不作裁决。纽约联邦法院法官考夫曼接着宣布拒绝罗森堡夫妇取消死刑判决的要求，并横蛮地拒绝遵照法律在上诉期间缓期执行死刑。同时，据美国通讯社消息，美国联邦法院执行官卡罗尔与第一助理法尔利已前赴新新监狱实地布置用电椅杀死罗森堡夫妇。
    美国统治者这种蔑视正义与公意、执意杀害无辜的作法，激起愈来愈多正直人民的抗议。据德意志通讯社报道，民主德国卡尔·马克思斯塔特区德苏友好协会代表它的三十六万五千会员提出抗议。新布兰登堡一千名合作社社员，拖拉机手和农业工人也投入为拯救美国这一对爱好和平的善良公民的运动，举行了抗议大会。
