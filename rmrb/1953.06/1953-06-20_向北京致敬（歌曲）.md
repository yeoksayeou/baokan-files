    Saluting Beijing
    [Note] After singing the third verse, repeat the chorus "Ah, great leader, our life! We wish you boundless longevity!" once to end, with the word "Ah" extended (eleven beats).
    Singing Instructions: "Saluting Beijing" is a relatively popular song from the First National Folk Music and Dance Performance. The lyricist and composer are both folk artists from the Uygur ethnic group in Xinjiang. Aymunisha, a famous singer from Xinjiang, learned the song through oral instruction from the composer and sang it in various parts of Xinjiang, where it was loved by people of all ethnic groups. This song expresses the happy life and joyful emotions of the people of Xinjiang after liberation, as well as their love and respect for Chairman Mao. Although the emotions are not yet fervent enough, it is still a good song. When singing this song, one should have a cheerful and lively mood, and the chorus should be sung very affectionately. The elongated notes in the melody should be sung without restraint, so that the entire song's emotion is coherent. The embellishments should be smooth and natural, not stiff.
    The musical score published here is based on a wire recording of Aymunisha's performance, and the lyrics are based on translations by Ma Zhifang, Aitowaerfu, and others, which have been collated and matched with the song. (Originally published in "Songs," Issue 6)

### 向北京致敬（歌曲）

    向北京致敬
    〔注〕唱完第三段时重唱副歌“哎，伟大的领袖，我们的生命！祝福你万寿无疆！”一遍结束，“哎”字延长（十一拍）。
    唱法说明“向北京致敬”是全国第一届民间音乐舞蹈会演中比较受欢迎的一首歌曲。词和曲的作者都是新疆维吾尔族民间艺人。新疆著名歌手阿依木尼莎经作曲者的口授学会了这首歌曲后，曾在新疆各地演唱，为各族人民所喜爱。这首歌表现了新疆人民解放后的幸福生活和愉快的情绪以及他们对毛主席的敬爱。虽然情绪上还不够热烈，但仍然是一首较好的歌曲。演唱这首歌曲，要有开朗活泼的情绪，副歌要唱得非常亲切；曲调中几处拖长音的地方，要唱得不感拘束，使全曲情绪连贯一气；装饰音要圆滑自然，不要生硬。
    这里发表的曲谱系根据阿依木尼莎演唱的钢丝录音记录下来的，歌词则是根据马志芳、艾图瓦尔夫等人的译词，经过整理而配歌的。（原载“歌曲”第六期）
