The design company of the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry has begun to promote the advanced working method of "organizing rhythmic production according to instruction charts," which has improved design efficiency and quality.

In mid-March, during the struggle against bureaucracy, the company thoroughly examined the design work and found that due to poor planning, work stoppages, rush jobs, idle work, and uneven workloads occurred frequently. From December of last year to mid-March of this year, design work was always in a passive state of producing while making plans. Groups and individuals also did not develop specific work plans. As a result, work efficiency was very low. Of the design tasks for 1953, only 44 percent were completed in the eight months from August of last year to March of this year, and the remaining tasks had to be completed in the second quarter of this year. In response to this situation, the company first strengthened planning management. A planning team was formed by designated personnel from the planning, business, and design departments. The method of estimating workload by drawing unit replaced the previous method of estimating workload by square millimeters, and the work plan for 1953 was revised. The masses were mobilized to discuss and formulate the production plans of each department and the work plans of each group and individual. On this basis, in early April, a working group was organized to promote "organized rhythmic production according to instruction charts," introducing the experience of Anshan Iron and Steel Company to various departments and organizing them to try it out.

Currently, there are three types of charts being used by each department: The first type is drawing cards (the card content includes reduced drawings, problems that need to be solved, work-hour records, contact records, work records, etc.). Before making a drawing, the workload is carefully estimated, the work content is understood, and the possible problems in the work are considered. In this way, it is possible to explore and formulate work-hour quotas from the actual work-hours used for each task, laying the foundation for formulating work plans in the future. The second type is progress instruction charts, including five types of charts such as individual plan progress charts, group plan progress charts, and department plan progress charts. These charts can help each designer and leading comrade clearly understand their own or each unit's production situation, so as to actively implement plans and appropriately allocate manpower to achieve balanced production. The third type is quality instruction charts: indicating the quality of the project and pointing out the number of errors and the places with the most errors. In this way, it can be used as a reference for improving work next time, and it can also alert everyone to correct the erroneous view of rushing tasks and neglecting quality.

Since each department implemented instruction charts, everyone has a clear understanding of the production situation, and production enthusiasm and work efficiency have also improved. The Electrical Lighting Department, which implemented the instruction charts earlier, found that the original labor organization was unreasonable during the trial implementation, so it changed from a group of four or five people to a two-person mutual assistance group, with specialized division of labor, which improved efficiency. At present, the average comrade can complete 7,000 square meters of engineering design per month, and skilled technicians can reach 12,000 square meters, which is two to four times higher than the original work quota, and two to five times higher than the department's past figure of 2,000 square meters completed per person per month. In addition, thanks to the quality instruction charts, it is possible to discover design errors in a timely manner and reduce construction difficulties caused by errors and unclear design drawings.

    重工业部设计公司组织有节奏生产
    提高设计工作效率和设计质量
    中央重工业部设计公司开始推行“按指示图表组织有节奏生产”的先进工作方法，提高了设计工作效率和质量。
    三月中旬该公司在反官僚主义的斗争中，深入地检查了设计工作，发现在工作中由于计划不周，经常发生停工、赶工、窝工和忙闲不均现象。从去年十二月起至今年三月中旬止，设计工作始终处于边生产边订计划的被动状态。小组与个人也没有制订具体的作业计划。因此，工作效率很低，一九五三年的设计任务，从去年八月开始到今年三月的八个月中只完成百分之四十四，而其余的任务，必须在今年第二季度中全部完成。根据这种情况，该公司首先加强了计划管理，由计划、业务、设计三科，指定专人组成计划小组；以图纸为单位估计工作量的方法，代替过去以平方粍估计工作量的方法，修订了一九五三年的工作计划。并发动群众讨论，制订出各科的生产计划与各小组、个人的作业计划。在这一基础上，于四月上旬组织了“按指示图表组织有节奏生产”的工作小组，向各科介绍了鞍山钢铁公司的经验，组织各科试行。
    目前各科正在使用的图表共有三类：第一类是制图卡片（卡片内容包括缩纸图样，需要解决联系的问题，工时记录，联系记录，工作记录等项），在做一张图纸之前，细致地估计工作量，熟悉工作内容，考虑在工作中可能遇到的问题，这样，就可以从制订每一项工作实际使用的工时中，摸索并制订工时定额，给以后制订作业计划打下基础。第二类是进度指示图表，包括个人计划进度表、小组计划进度表、科计划进度表等五种图表。这些图表可以帮助每个设计人员与领导同志清楚了解自己的或各单位的生产情况，从而能够主动地执行计划，适当地调配人力，做到均衡生产。第三类是质量指示图表：表示工程的质量，指出错误的件数与错误最多的地方。这样，就可作为下一次改进工作的参考，又可以警惕大家纠正赶任务而忽视质量的错误观点。
    自从各科推行指示图表以后，大家对生产情况心中有了数，生产积极性和工作效率也提高了。推行较早的电气照明科在试行指示图表中，发现原有的劳动组织不合理，就由四、五个人一组改为两人互助小组，专责分工，提高了效率。目前一般同志每人每月可以完成七千平方公尺的工程设计，技术熟练的可以达到一万二千平方公尺，比原来的工作定额提高了二倍到四倍，比该科过去每人每月完成二千平方公尺的数字提高了二倍多到五倍。另外，由于有了质量指示图表，就能够及时发现设计上的错误，减少因设计图纸错误和不清楚而引起的施工困难。
