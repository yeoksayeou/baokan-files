Xinhua News Agency, June 3rd dispatch from New York: The US government and judicial authorities, disregarding the Rosenberg's defense lawyer, Emanuel Bloch's, accusation that New York Federal Court Judge Kaufman's sentencing of the Rosenbergs to death was a violation of constitutional rights, and disregarding Bloch's request for a stay of execution in order to present new evidence to prove that there was no basis for sentencing the Rosenbergs to death, still insist on executing the Rosenbergs as soon as possible. On June 2nd, US Federal Court Executioner Carroll, after consulting with the warden of Sing Sing Prison, announced that the Rosenbergs would be executed by electric chair at 11:00 PM (New York time) on June 18th. Following this, the US Court of Appeals announced its rejection of the Rosenbergs' request to overturn the death sentence.

    美政府横暴决定在十八日杀害罗森堡夫妇
    【新华社三日讯】纽约消息：美国政府与司法当局不顾罗森堡夫妇的辩护律师伊曼纽尔·布洛克指控纽约联邦法院法官考夫曼判处罗森堡夫妇死刑是侵犯了宪法权利，也不顾布洛克要求缓刑，以便提出新的证据来证明根本没有根据判罗森堡夫妇死刑，仍坚持尽快杀害罗森堡夫妇。六月二日，美国联邦法院执行官卡罗尔在与新新监狱的狱吏商量后，宣布在六月十八日晚上十一时（纽约时间）用电椅杀死罗森堡夫妇。接着，美国上诉法院宣布拒绝罗森堡夫妇请求取消死刑判决的要求。
