Xinhua News Agency, June 17th—Just as the United States is attempting to intensify its intrusion into Indochina, the Khmer puppet king, Sihanouk, recently led a portion of his subordinates to "flee" from Cambodia to Bangkok, the capital of Thailand.

In his statement, Sihanouk said that his departure was due to the "tense" relationship between France and Cambodia. It is known that in March, Sihanouk went to Paris for negotiations, demanding that France grant so-called "true independence" to ease the rising Cambodian people's liberation movement and to obtain more rights for himself. The negotiations were unsuccessful because France was unwilling to loosen its control over Cambodia. Despite this, Sihanouk, upon his departure, still requested that Cambodians "maintain friendship with French officers and officials in Cambodia."

Sihanouk's "flight" has made France feel embarrassed and annoyed. The Ministry of Relations with Member States of the French Federation hurriedly issued a communique on the 14th, defending France's attitude in its negotiations with Sihanouk and accusing Sihanouk's "flight" of being "incorrect." French officials even threateningly hinted that if Sihanouk did not end his "escape" and return to Cambodia, France would abolish him and find someone else to be "king."

Sihanouk's "flight" has aroused the "concern" of the United States. Sihanouk "visited" the United States in April and met with US Secretary of State Dulles. After Sihanouk's "flight," US State Department officials have expressed "concern" about the matter. At the same time, the United States is preparing to use "aid" to intervene in this issue. US Representative Vorys revealed that the US House of Representatives will discuss the Cambodian situation this week when it discusses the "Foreign Aid Bill."

    高棉傀儡国王“出走”到曼谷
    法政府狼狈，美政府“关怀”
    【新华社十七日讯】正当美国企图加紧侵入印度支那的时候，高棉傀儡国王西哈努克最近率领他的一部分臣属从高棉“出走”到泰国首都曼谷。
    西哈努克在他的声明中说：他的出走是因为法国和高棉的关系“很紧张”。大家知道，三月间西哈努克曾到巴黎进行谈判，要求法国给予所谓“真正的独立”，以缓和日益高涨的高棉人民解放运动，并使他自己获得较多的权利。谈判由于法国不愿放松对高棉的控制而没有结果。虽然如此，西哈努克在出走时却又要求高棉人“和在高棉的法国军官及官员保持友好”。
    西哈努克的“出走”使法国感到狼狈和恼怒。法兰西联邦成员国关系部急忙在十四日发表公报，一面辩解法国在它和西哈努克谈判中的所采取的态度，一面指责西哈努克的“出走”是“不正确的”。法国官方人士更威胁地暗示，如果西哈努克不结束他的“逃亡”，重新回到高棉来，法国将废除他，另找别人做“国王”。
    西哈努克的“出走”已引起美国的“关怀”。西哈努克曾在四月间“访问”美国，并和美国国务卿杜勒斯会晤。西哈努克“出走”之后，美国国务院官员已对此事表示“关心”。美国同时正准备利用“援助”插手这个问题。美国众议员伏利斯透露，美国众院在本周讨论“对外援助法案”的时候，将讨论高棉的局势。
