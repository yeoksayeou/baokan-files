    Jin County Supply and Marketing Cooperative Joint Association Conducts Inspection on Incorrectly Issued Cotton Seeds

    A letter from Li Songyin, Director of the Jin County Supply and Marketing Cooperative Joint Association in Hebei Province: The criticism of our cooperative published in the "Summary of Letters from Readers" column on April 18th is correct, and we sincerely accept it.

    In February of this year, our cooperative received instructions from the Shijiazhuang Special District Cooperative to transfer 500,000 jin of high-quality cotton seeds to Shulu County (the original letter of criticism mistakenly stated 50,000 jin). The cotton seeds were originally managed by Liu Bingyi of the original cotton management department. Later, Liu Bingyi participated in Party rectification studies and Liu Hengmao was responsible for the management. During the handover, Liu Bingyi explained to Liu Hengmao that 500,000 jin of cotton seeds had been identified as unqualified, but Liu Hengmao did not ask which pile it was. When Shulu County Cooperative sent people to transport the good seeds, Liu Hengmao (the original letter of criticism mistakenly stated Liu Bingyi) allowed the unqualified good seeds to be transported as well. It was not until the next day when he spoke to Liu Bingyi about it that he realized he had made a mistake. At this time, there were still fifty sacks of unqualified cotton seeds packed and ready for transport. Liu Hengmao told the Deputy Section Chief of the Promotion Section, Wang Zhongyi, about the mistake of sending the wrong good seeds (the original letter of criticism mistakenly stated Director Li). Wang Zhongyi actually said: "Just let them go!" As a result, the 20,000 jin of unqualified good seeds transported by Shulu County Cooperative were mixed with the good seeds and had to be sold at a low price, causing a total loss of more than 5 million yuan to state property. Our cooperative has decided to give Liu Hengmao a demerit and criticize Wang Zhongyi; we have already requested instructions from the relevant higher authorities.

    The situation regarding the moldy corn is as follows: At the end of last year, the county grain company asked our cooperative's grain group to temporarily store 144,000 jin of damp corn. Our comrades repeatedly urged the grain company to inspect the grain, but the company's inspection was not timely enough. On February 20th, when the company inspected, it was found that more than 15,000 jin of corn had deteriorated due to heat. The relevant higher authorities are now dealing with this issue.

    One of the reasons for the incorrect issuance of cotton seeds is that I did not pay enough attention to the storage of good cotton seeds on a daily basis and rarely educated the custodians. In the moldy corn incident, although I urged the grain company to inspect the grain several times, I had the attitude that "the company is responsible for the damage to the grain" and did not care enough about the grain. I should bear considerable responsibility for the above two matters and have requested the higher authorities to give me the appropriate punishment.

### 晋县供销合作社联合社对错发棉种事已作检查

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    晋县供销合作社联合社对错发棉种事已作检查
    河北晋县供销合作社联合社主任李松荫来信：四月十八日“读者来信摘要”栏所刊读者对我社的批评是正确的，我们诚恳接受。
    今年二月，我社接石家庄专区合作社指示，调往束鹿县优良棉种五十万斤（原批评信误为五万斤）。棉种原由原棉经理部刘秉义负责保管，后刘秉义参加整党学习，由刘恒茂负责保管。在接交时，刘秉义对刘恒茂说明有五十万斤棉种经鉴定不合格，但刘恒茂也未问是那一堆。束鹿县社派人来运良种时，刘恒茂（原批评信误为刘秉义）把不合格的良种也让运走了，到第二天见到刘秉义谈起这事才知道发错了。这时还有五十麻袋不合格的棉种装好待运，刘恒茂把错发良种事和束鹿县社来人说了一下，结果把这五十袋也运走了。事后刘恒茂向推销科副科长王仲义报告（原批评信误为李主任），王仲义竟说：“发走就算了吧！”结果，束鹿县社运走的两万斤不合格的良种与良种混了，只得全部低价出售，共使国家资财损失五百余万元。我社决定给刘恒茂记过处分，给王仲义以批评；已向有关上级请示。
    关于玉米霉烂问题的情况如下：去年年底县粮食公司让我社粮食组代为保管潮玉米十四万四千斤，我社同志多次督促粮食公司检查粮食，但该公司检查得很不及时。到二月二十日该公司检查时，发现玉米发热变质一万五千余斤，现在有关上级正在处理这个问题。
    造成棉籽错发事件的原因之一，是我平日对良棉种籽保管工作重视不够，对保管人员很少教育，而在玉米霉烂事件中，虽然几次督促粮食公司检查粮食，但自己抱着“粮食坏了由公司负责”的态度，对粮食关心是不够的。我对上述两事应负相当责任，已请上级给以应得处分。
