Learning from the Beijing Soviet Red Cross Hospital

    The Beijing Soviet Red Cross Hospital has been established for a year. In the past year, thanks to the leadership of Director Prokharov and the efforts of all Soviet experts and nurses, great achievements have been made in medical work. The establishment of the Beijing Soviet Red Cross Hospital has not only relieved the suffering of many patients and had a great impact on China's medical community, but also set a brilliant example for Chinese medical workers in terms of hospital management methods and a medical style of wholeheartedly serving patients.

    Several difficult cases cured by Soviet experts powerfully demonstrate that Soviet medicine, based on dialectical materialism, is the most advanced medicine in the world. Advanced Soviet medicine and technology have played a huge role in promoting the development of China's medical and health undertakings. In the past year, in order to spread advanced medical ideas and technologies to China, Soviet experts have not only adopted various methods to train Chinese medical personnel studying in the hospital amidst their busy schedules, but also formulated teaching plans and personally taught courses for the industrial and mining tuberculosis prevention and control training class of the Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government. Experts in the Department of Pulmonary Tuberculosis of the hospital enthusiastically guided the tuberculosis prevention and treatment work of the Tuberculosis Prevention and Treatment Institute of the Beijing Branch of the Red Cross Society of China and the industrial and mining enterprises near the city. In addition, Soviet experts from various departments have made 20 to 50 academic reports, participated in more than 200 consultations, and taken time out of their rest to write many papers. All of this has deeply moved us.

    Several vivid examples of treating patients illustrate the high sense of responsibility of Soviet experts and medical staff towards patients. In order to explore the root cause of a patient's illness, they always repeatedly check and study until they arrive at a correct diagnosis. In order to take care of a critically ill patient, they often forget to eat and sleep until the patient is out of danger. In order to eliminate a patient's ideological doubts, their attitude is sincere and kind, making the patient feel closer than their own relatives. This spirit is also prominently reflected in the close integration of superb medical technology and the vital interests of the people. They try their best to protect the integrity of the patient's body, and no matter what kind of patient it is, they never damage any of their tissues unless it is absolutely necessary. These noble communist medical ethics, the excellent qualities of medical workers cultivated by Lenin and Stalin, and the selfless internationalist spirit have been widely praised by the Chinese people. This is also an example worthy of our learning.

    The Beijing Soviet Red Cross Hospital is a precious gift from the Soviet people to the Chinese people. It is tasked with serving the Chinese people with modern medical science, introducing advanced experience in Soviet medicine, and training new types of medical personnel. In the past year, the hospital's contributions in these areas have also demonstrated that all Soviet experts and Soviet medical workers have sincerely and selflessly completed this arduous task. The specific performance of the Beijing Soviet Red Cross Hospital over the past year, whether it is their advanced medical ideas and technology, medical management methods and systems, as well as their good medical style and serious work attitude, are all very admirable. Therefore, we must earnestly implement Chairman Mao's instruction at the Fourth Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference to learn from the advanced Soviet science and technology with all sincerity and wholeheartedly, and learn from the Beijing Soviet Red Cross Hospital and all Soviet experts and Soviet medical workers to build China's medical and health undertakings.

    向北京苏联红十字医院学习
    中国红十字会总会副会长  彭泽民  熊瑾玎
    北京苏联红十字医院成立一年了。一年来，由于甫罗哈洛夫院长的领导和所有苏联专家、护士们的努力，在医疗工作上已获得很大成就。北京苏联红十字医院的成立，不仅给很多病人解除了苦痛，给我国医药界以很大的影响；并且，在医院管理方法和全心全意为病人服务的医疗作风上，也给我国医务工作者树立了光辉的榜样。
    若干个经过苏联专家们治愈的疑难病例都有力地说明了：以辩证唯物主义为基础的苏联医学，是世界上最先进的医学。先进的苏联医学和技术，对我国医药卫生事业的建设已起了巨大的推动作用。一年来，苏联专家为了把先进的医学思想和技术传播给我国，他们除在百忙中采用各种方法来培养在该院学习的我国医务人员外，还为中央人民政府卫生部的工矿防痨训练班制订了教学计划并亲自授课。该院肺结核科专家，曾热情地指导着中国红十字会北京市分会结核病防治院和市区附近工矿中的结核病防治工作；此外，各科的苏联专家都作过二十到五十次学术性的报告，参加过二百多次会诊，并抽出休息时间写了许多论文。这都是使我们深受感动的。
    若干对待病人的生动事例，又说明了苏联专家和医务工作人员对待病人的高度负责精神。为探讨一个病人的疾病根源，他们总是反复地检查研究，直到得出正确的诊断为止；为照顾一个危急的病人，他们往往是废寝忘食，直到病人转危为安；为消除一个病人在思想上的疑虑，他们的态度真诚亲切，使病人感到比亲人还亲。这种精神还突出地表现在精湛的医疗技术和人民切身利益紧密结合这一点上，他们极力保护病人身体的完整，不管什么样的病人，不到万不得已，决不损坏他们任何一处组织。这些高尚的共产主义医疗道德，列宁、斯大林培养出来的医务工作者的优秀品质，以及忘我的国际主义精神，已经广泛地得到我国人民的赞扬。这也是值得我们学习的范例。
    北京苏联红十字医院是苏联人民赠给我国人民的珍贵礼物。它负有以现代医药科学为我国人民服务、介绍苏联医学方面的先进经验和培养新型医务人员的任务。一年来，该院在这些方面的贡献，也说明了所有苏联专家和苏联医务工作者已真诚无私地完成了这一艰巨任务。北京苏联红十字医院一年来的具体表现，无论是他们先进的医学思想和技术，医学管理方法和制度，以及良好的医疗作风和严肃的工作态度，都是十分使人钦佩的。因此，我们必须切实地贯彻毛主席在中国人民政治协商会议第一届全国委员会第四次会议上所作的诚心诚意地学习苏联先进的科学技术的指示，向北京苏联红十字医院及所有苏联专家和苏联医务工作者学习，来建设我国的医药卫生事业。
