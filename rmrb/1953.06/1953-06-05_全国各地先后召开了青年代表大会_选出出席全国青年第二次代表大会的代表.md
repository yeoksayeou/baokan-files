    [This Newspaper] News: To welcome the Second National Congress of the All-China Youth Federation, which will be held in Beijing on June 10, youth congresses have been convened successively in cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, Shenyang, Wuhan, Guangzhou, Anshan, Zhangjiakou, Hangzhou, Xuzhou, Suzhou, Hefei, Xin Hailian, Kaifeng, Nanchang, Jingdezhen, Chengdu, and Luzhou, as well as provinces such as Sichuan and Xikang, in April and May. These congresses reviewed and summarized the work of the local Democratic Youth Leagues in the past, clarified the direction and tasks of the local Democratic Youth Leagues, strengthened the unity of youth from all walks of life, and inspired the enthusiasm of the vast number of young people to participate in the construction of the motherland. The local congresses also elected delegates to the Second National Congress of the All-China Youth Federation.
    Youth from all walks of life enthusiastically supported the convening of local youth congresses and actively participated in various pre-congress activities. Some places convened youth representative meetings or youth congresses at the district or street level to democratically elect representatives. Those elected as representatives felt immensely honored. When Ni Shou-zheng, a Manchu youth from Beijing, was elected as a representative, his whole family was very happy. His father specifically went to the district committee of the Communist Youth League to express his gratitude to the Party and the government for their concern for ethnic minorities. Young people also held many forums and submitted many proposals of positive significance to the congress. Youth from all walks of life in Chongqing held more than 400 forums, and Xuzhou held more than 60 forums. Representatives in some areas went deep into the youth masses to extensively collect public opinions.
    The local youth congresses all conscientiously reviewed and summarized the work of the local Democratic Youth Leagues. The representatives attending the congress believed that the work of the Democratic Youth Leagues had been successful, having begun to establish initial contact with the vast number of young people and having a certain influence among youth from all walks of life. In the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, various social reform movements, and the cause of national economic recovery and development, the local Democratic Youth Leagues assisted the Party and the People's Government in doing a great deal of work, and the young people themselves were also educated in these movements. After the Shanghai Municipal Democratic Youth League Preparatory Committee cooperated with relevant parties to mobilize more than 10,000 young intellectuals to volunteer to go south with the army or to serve in the newly liberated areas, more than 14,000 young people from society took up jobs and learning positions. The Democratic Youth Leagues in many cities organized street youth to study in various forms. Some Democratic Youth Leagues, based on the hobbies and interests of the youth masses, and in conjunction with the central work, carried out various cultural and sports activities, widely organizing the young people. At the local youth congresses, the representatives also boldly expressed their opinions on the shortcomings of the work of the local Democratic Youth Leagues. Youth representatives attending the congress in Luzhou criticized the city's Democratic Youth League for not paying enough attention to youth from all walks of life, especially those who were unorganized, in the past. Youth representatives from Zhangjiakou put forward more than 100 suggestions for the future work of the local Democratic Youth League.
    The local youth congresses received the leadership and assistance of the local Party committees, governments, and Communist Youth League organizations. The local Communist Youth League organizations actively undertook various preparatory tasks for the congress. The responsible persons of the local Party committees and governments participated in the congress and made reports to the congress, enabling the youth representatives present to further understand the current domestic and international situation, clearly recognize the glorious and arduous tasks that young people should shoulder in the new historical period, and expressed their willingness to do their jobs well, study hard, and take on the tasks entrusted to them by the motherland under the leadership and education of the Party, the government, and the Communist Youth League organizations. Young people in the industrial and commercial circles in Nanchang expressed that they would actively manage their businesses, do a good job in their operations, and ensure the completion of national tax tasks to support the resistance against U.S. aggression and aid Korea and national construction, and put forward seven guarantees at the congress. Street youth representatives in Chongqing clearly recognized that doing a good job in supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to families of soldiers, maintaining public security, etc., is to support the resistance against U.S. aggression and aid Korea and economic construction, and they expressed that they would play a greater role in these areas in the future. Representatives of ethnic minorities in Kaifeng said: "We must strengthen ethnic unity, work together with one heart and one mind, and do a good job in construction." Representatives from the technical field generally expressed their determination to combine with workers, learn from advanced Soviet experience, and contribute more to the construction of the motherland. Representatives attending the Chengdu Youth Congress said: In the face of the motherland's new economic construction, our knowledge is really not enough, and if we don't study, we will fall behind. The youth representatives of Ma Shi Street in Xuzhou, after attending the city's youth congress, immediately set about reorganizing and organizing a study class that had already collapsed.
    The local youth congresses carefully elected delegates to the Second National Congress of the All-China Youth Federation, and these delegates are gathering in various major administrative regions, preparing to come to Beijing to participate in the congress. The convening of local youth congresses has played a broad mobilizing role among youth of all ethnic groups from all walks of life across the country, creating conditions for the success of the Second National Congress of the All-China Youth Federation.

    各地各界青年热烈拥护当地青年代表大会的召开，积极参加会前各种活动。有些地方以一个区、一条街为单位，召开了青年代表会议或青年大会，民主选举代表。被当选为代表的，都感到莫大的光荣。北京市满族青年倪守正当选为代表，一家人都很高兴，他的父亲特地跑到团区委，说出自己感谢党和政府关心少数民族的心情。青年们并纷纷举行座谈会，给大会提了许多有积极意义的提案。重庆市各界青年举行了四百多次座谈会，徐州市举行了六十多次座谈会，有些地区的代表深入青年群众，广泛搜集群众意见。
    各地青年代表大会都比较认真地检查和总结了当地民主青年联合会的工作。参加代表大会的代表都认为，民主青联的工作是有成绩的，它已开始与广大青年建立了初步的联系，在各界青年中有一定的影响。各地民主青联在抗美援朝运动、各项社会改革运动和国家经济的恢复与发展事业中，协助党和人民政府做了许多工作，而青年们自己也在这些运动中受到了教育。上海市经过上海市民主青联筹委会配合有关方面动员了青年知识分子一万多人志愿南下随军工作或到新解放区服务，一万四千多社会青年走上了工作和学习岗位。许多城市的民主青年联合会以各种不同形式，组织街道青年学习。有些民主青年联合会根据青年群众的爱好和兴趣，结合中心工作，开展了各项文娱体育活动，把青年们广泛地组织起来。在各地青年代表会中，代表们对当地民主青联的工作的缺点也大胆提出了意见。泸州市参加大会的青年代表批评了该市民主青年联合会过去对各界青年，特别是对无组织的青年关心不够。张家口市青年代表对当地民主青联今后工作提出了一百多项建议。
    各地青年代表大会，得到了当地党、政府和青年团组织的领导和帮助。各地青年团组织积极担负了大会的各项准备工作。各地党委、政府负责人参加了大会，并向大会做了报告，使到会青年代表进一步认清了目前国内外形势，明确认识了在新的历史时期青年们应担负的光荣与艰巨的任务，纷纷表示要在党、政府及青年团组织的领导和教育下做好本岗位工作，努力学习，把祖国交予自己的任务担当起来。南昌市工商界青年表示要积极经营，搞好业务，保证完成国家税收任务，来支援抗美援朝与祖国建设，并在大会上提出了七项保证。重庆市街道青年代表明确认识了做好拥军优属、治安保卫等工作就是支援抗美援朝和经济建设，他们表示今后要在这些方面发挥更大的作用。开封市少数民族代表说：“我们要加强民族团结，同心协力，搞好建设。”技术界的代表普遍表示决心和工人结合，学习苏联先进经验，为祖国建设贡献更多力量。参加成都市青年代表大会的代表说：在祖国新经济建设面前，我们的知识实在不够，再不学习，就要落后了。徐州市马市街的青年代表，在该市开完青年代表大会后，马上着手把一个已经垮了台的学习班，重新整顿和组织起来。
    各地青年代表大会慎重地选举了出席全国青年第二次代表大会的代表，这些代表正纷纷在各大行政区集中，准备来京参加大会。各地青年代表大会的召开，在全国各界各族青年中发挥了广泛的动员作用，为开好全国青年第二次代表大会创造了条件。
