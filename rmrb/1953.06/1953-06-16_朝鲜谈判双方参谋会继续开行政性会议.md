The various meetings in Panmunjom are still being held in secret, and it is speculated that they will continue to be held in secret until everything is ready for the signing of the armistice agreement. But today's signs are:
	The liaison officers of both sides held a meeting at 9:30 am, the first to draft administrative details, and adjourned after 20 minutes. The date of the next liaison officer meeting will be notified by the security officer.
	In the meeting hut, the staff continued to work with maps from 11 am until the afternoon. In the past few days, when the staff took a break, their assistants continued to work with maps.
	Another group of staff, who have been meeting since the prisoner of war agreement was signed, brought large bundles of maps into tents near the Panmunjom highway for the first time today.
	According to agreements reached at past meetings, the 63-article armistice agreement is accompanied by various maps. These maps will show the northern and southern boundaries of the military demarcation line and the demilitarized zone, the ten ports in North and South Korea where personnel are allowed to rotate and equipment to be replaced on a one-for-one basis during the armistice, and the main lines of communication for neutral nations inspection groups traveling between Panmunjom and the various ports.

    朝鲜谈判双方参谋会继续开行政性会议
    【新华社开城十五日电】朝鲜停战谈判朝中代表团发表公报如下：六月十五日两个双方参谋会继续举行行政性会议，并定于十六日上午十一时继续开会。同日上午举行了双方联络组会议。
    【新华社开城十五日电】本社特派记者吴敏报道：板门店今天活动频繁，表明在全世界翘首盼望的停战协定签字以前，拟订最后行政细节的工作，正获得迅速进展。板门店的各种会议仍旧是秘密进行的，据推测将一直秘密地举行到为停战协定签字的一切都准备停当时为止。但是今天的迹象是：
    双方联络官在上午九时三十分举行会议，第一次进行拟订行政细节，二十分钟后休会。下一次联络官会议何时举行，将由安全军官通知。
    在会议小屋里，参谋人员在上午十一时开始继续对着地图工作，一直工作到下午。在过去几天中，当参谋人员休会时，他们的助理人员继续带着地图工作。
    自从战俘问题协议签订以来一直在举行会议的另一组参谋人员，今天第一次带了大捆地图进入板门店公路附近的帐篷里。
    根据过去会议所达成的协议，六十三款的停战协定附有各种地图。这些地图将显示军事分界线和非军事区的北缘和南缘，在停战期间允许轮换人员和在一件换一件的基础上进行替换的装备进入南北朝鲜的十个口岸，中立国视察小组往返于板门店和各个口岸间的主要交通线。
