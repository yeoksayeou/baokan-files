　　The evil war of aggression launched by the American imperialists and the Syngman Rhee bandit gang against the peace-loving people of our country has already lasted for three years. The complete failure of the political and military strategic plans devised by the American imperialists is the basic summary of this war. Now, the aggressors' troops have been stalled for a long time near the 38th parallel, where they perfidiously launched their offensive, and are unable to advance.

　　The heroic struggle of the Korean people has definitively proven that no force can subdue a free people who defend the freedom, independence, and honor of their motherland and their democratic achievements, and who possess a firm will and belief in victory. Together with the fraternal Chinese People's Volunteers, the Korean People's Army defends our motherland from American imperialist aggression, safeguards the security of the Chinese border, and demonstrates to the people of the world that this is not a concession to or encouragement of the aggressors, but a decisive blow and pressure against the disturbers of peace.

　　The war waged by American imperialists in Korea over the past three years is a direct result of their aggressive foreign policy and the formation of military aggression blocs, as well as their policy of preparing for a new world war. American imperialists began the war of aggression against Korea and determined such broad goals in an attempt to conquer our country through war, turn the Korean people into their slaves, obtain a strategic bridgehead convenient for aggression against the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, and transform the American economy into a military system to prevent the impending economic crisis.

　　American imperialists began aggressive preparations to subvert the Democratic People's Republic of Korea by force long ago. This has been confirmed by many well-founded materials published in peacetime. Even the reactionary American "Life" magazine said that the ruling group of the United States of America planned to end the war in Korea in "a few days." It also smugly reported that, "In the history of the United States, at no time has the preparation for the start of a war been as fully prepared as this war. Now, just look at the situation in the weeks after the start of the war, and you can see that our troops in Korea have more soldiers and weapons than we dispatched in December 1942 to attack North Africa, eleven months after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor."

　　According to the plan of the U.S. military headquarters preparing for war, the Syngman Rhee puppet army, equipped by the United States and trained by American instructors, was scheduled to launch the war of aggression. As revealed in the documents seized when our People's Army liberated Seoul, the enemy had long ago formulated an offensive plan against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. According to this plan, they attempted to send two Syngman Rhee armies, in coordination with the Marine Corps, to advance northward in the general direction, enter north of the 38th parallel, and occupy Pyongyang; after that, they would continue to attack the Chinese border.

　　American imperialists had anticipated that the Syngman Rhee puppet army would be unable to undertake the task of aggression against the people of the northern half of Korea. In this situation, the United States of America, under the pretext of "aiding" the Syngman Rhee regime that was "invaded," decided to take direct armed intervention. The current U.S. Secretary of State—the infamous Dulles—stayed in South Korea on the eve of the war. He gave the following instructions to Syngman Rhee: immediately start the "Northern Expedition," while making propaganda saying that North Korea attacked South Korea first. As long as you can maintain it for two weeks, then the situation will be favorable. Because during this period, the United States of America will denounce North Korea for attacking South Korea, and at that time, the United States can send its army, navy, and air force for the Korean people.

　　This is how the American aggressors vainly attempted to "defeat at once" our People's Army, conquer the Korean people, and obliterate the people's democratic system in our country. However, despite the fact that American imperialists dispatched to Korea a tremendous armed force that was superior to the armed forces of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in terms of quantity, technology, and equipment immediately after the start of the war, this adventurous plan has met with complete bankruptcy.

　　The main miscalculation of the American plunderers lay in their failure to estimate the infinite strength of the Korean people, their failure to estimate the iron will and courage of the Korean people who defend their freedom and independence, and their indomitable fighting spirit to fight for the freedom and happiness of their motherland.

　　All freedom-loving Koreans unanimously rose up to wage the sacred Fatherland Liberation War, giving the plunderers a devastating blow. The rapid defeat of the Syngman Rhee puppet army after its sudden invasion of the northern half of the Republic not only exposed the corruption of the Syngman Rhee puppet regime and the incompetence of the reactionary army of South Korea, but also foreshadowed the failure of American imperialist aggression policy in our country. Encouraged by the noble will to safeguard the democratic achievements of our people and defend the freedom and independence of their motherland, the young People's Army liberated more than 90 percent of the entire South Korean territory in the first two months of the war. The Americans' expectations for the anti-people Syngman Rhee regime and its army were completely shattered. Due to the strong blows of the People's Army, the puppet regime collapsed. The Syngman Rhee government left behind its demoralized and hastily retreating army and fled in panic. The South Korean people were liberated from the oppression of American imperialism and regained the freedom and happiness they had once received from the great Soviet army, which had driven out the Japanese plunderers from our country in 1945. Our people's wise leader, Marshal Kim Il-sung, said on July 8, 1950: "If there had been no direct armed intervention by American imperialists, the civil war launched by American imperialist lackeys in our country would have ended long ago, the unification of our country would have been completed long ago, and the people of the southern half would have been completely liberated from the reactionary police rule of the Syngman Rhee bandit gang."

　　The rulers of Wall Street, seeing the inevitable demise of the Syngman Rhee army and the impending liberation of the entire South Korean territory by the People's Army in a short period of time, appeared on the stage, using the banner of the United Nations as a cover, and began direct armed intervention against our people. At the same time, the U.S. Navy occupied China's territory—Taiwan. However, the American interventionists who invaded our motherland could not reverse the situation. The brave People's Army powerfully struck the elite American divisions, driving them to the port of Busan at the southern tip of the Korean Peninsula. American aggressors fell into the dangerous situation of being directly driven out of the Korean Peninsula.

　　In order to salvage this situation, the U.S. military headquarters mobilized all the land, sea, and air forces in the Pacific region, and even transferred part of the Mediterranean fleet to the Korean waters, investing all its strength in an attempt to suppress our people. In September 1950, as the beginning of the so-called "final and decisive attack," the U.S. command announced the Incheon landing operation. This created an extremely serious situation on the front line. Due to significant differences in military equipment and troop numbers with the enemy, the Korean People's Army had to retreat. However, the American command's arrogant boasts of complete victory were immediately overturned in the course of military operations.

　　The advance of the U.S. military was not a parallel pursuit to defeat and annihilate the retreating enemy force, but a mad rush by adventurers to frantically pursue quick and easy victory. The Korean People's Army and the fraternal Chinese People's Volunteers, sent by the great Chinese people to support the People's Army, organized large forces on the flanks of the interventionist forces advancing toward the Chinese border, heavily striking and pursuing the aggressors. In just two months, the enemy was completely wiped out in all areas north of the 38th parallel. The Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer forces conducted a series of victorious operations to encircle and annihilate the enemy in the course of powerful counterattacks. These operations testified to the growth of commanders and the merits of the combatants of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers. The American army and the armies of its vassal states retreated continuously for more than two hundred kilometers, until they attempted to resist on the 38th parallel. The continuously retreating American army could only slightly reorganize its combat deployment on this line and then switch to defensive warfare.

　　Since then, the U.S. military command has repeatedly clamored for so-called "decisive," "final" winter, summer, spring, and autumn offensives, attempting to retaliate. But as is well known, all these offensives have failed miserably each time. The American imperialist invading forces have suffered fatal blows. The Korean people, rising up to defend their democratic achievements, have blocked the adventurous path of the aggressors. American imperialists have gradually suffered defeat not only militarily but also politically and morally.

　　U.S. President Eisenhower arrogantly declared that the U.S. armed forces "can dominate the entire world." This statement is also an arrogant nonsense to our country, which heroically and resolutely resists foreign aggressors and their aggressive plans and gives them practical lessons. American aggressors, panicked by military failure, have committed bestial atrocities against the peaceful residents of Korea and the captured personnel of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers. The interventionists are committing crimes on Korean soil that are even more terrible than the inhumane crimes of Hitler. When napalm bombs, shootings, and death camps could not bring victory to the American aggressors, they used bacteriological weapons in Korea, which were condemned and cursed by mankind. The United States, dreaming of dominating the world, attempted to realize its thoughts, which were published in the Washington "New York Herald Tribune" on July 4, 1949, in our country. The newspaper wrote: "In modern warfare, we must destroy the enemy's nation, destroy its power, and obliterate it from the earth forever… Let us send planes loaded with atomic bombs, germ bombs, and powerful explosives to slaughter children in cradles, praying old women, and working workers."

　　The aggressors attempted to use bacteria of cholera, typhoid, and other infectious and murderous diseases to eliminate our heroic people. But the American aggressors cannot obliterate the courage of our people's will and our people's aspiration for freedom and hatred for the oppressors. The Korean people, regardless of the crazy war methods carried out by the aggressors, persisted in the struggle and caused the hateful enemy to suffer serious military, political, and moral losses. In the liberation war against the imperialist united forces headed by the United States of America, our heroic people exposed the mask of American imperialists, making it the gendarme and executioner of the Asian people in front of the whole world.

　　Why have our people been able to resist the violent military pressure of the imperialists for three years and inflict military, political, and moral blows on them?

　　Because our people waged a just Fatherland Liberation War to defend the freedom and national independence of their motherland, they triumphed in the struggle against the imperialist aggressors.

　　The course of the war provoked by the American imperialists has confirmed the solidity of the people's democratic system and the unanimous support of the broad masses of people in the northern and southern halves of our country for this system.

　　Our front and rear have become a unified combat camp. All Korean people resolutely and bravely support the Korean People's Army, doing everything possible to eliminate foreign aggressors and the Syngman Rhee traitorous bandits.

　　Forty percent of the workers responded to the call of the Korean Workers' Party as early as the beginning of the war and volunteered to join the army and guerrillas. The workers became the basic core of our Republic's armed forces. The workers who remained in the rear heroically fought on the labor front. In the positions of their husbands and brothers who went to the front, stood their wives, sisters, and younger brothers. During the bombing, the workers risked their lives to rescue machines and equipment and put out fires.

　　The liberated peasants worked selflessly on the land given by the people's state. Under the conditions of wartime difficulties and labor shortages in production, they still ensured that our Korean People's Army and the people in the rear did not suffer great food difficulties. They achieved a bumper harvest last year, expanded the sown area this year, and are carrying out field operations in a more organized manner. The People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer combatants gave the peasants great help in the rush work of sowing and harvesting.

　　The terrible threat of American enslavement further strengthened the People's Fatherland Unification Democratic Front and further united our people around the beloved leader Marshal Kim Il-sung.

　　When the nation's survival was threatened, the spiritual and political unity of our people was consolidated. This spiritual and political unity, which grew and developed as a result of various democratic reforms and the understanding of the just nature and purpose of the Liberation War, became the source of strength for the Korean people. It inspired and motivated the soldiers at the front, the working people in the rear, and the guerrillas in the occupied areas.

　　All the Korean people, in the sacred struggle, constantly display this noble revolutionary patriotism based on love for the motherland and infinite loyalty to the people's democratic system.

　　Under the leadership of the Korean Workers' Party, the People's Army has been tempered into an iron army that understands military art in the course of combat. The Workers' Party, absorbing the experience of the Soviet Union's great Patriotic War, constantly developed courage and fortitude within the army and cultivated the ability to defeat the enemy under any circumstances. The People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer forces have grown into powerful armed forces capable of crushing all enemy aggression attempts in the course of the war.

　　The just belief in fighting for the freedom and independence of the motherland is the source of the collective heroism of the combatants of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers. In Korea, they are building heroic feats every day. The immortal achievements of the eight hundred warriors who defended Wolmido Island (west of Seoul) in September 1950 will forever shine. Soldiers Kim Chang-je, Kim Ok-geun, and Li Shu-fu blocked the enemy's firing ports with their bodies, ensuring the victorious advance of our attacking troops. The names of the People's Army soldiers who established the outstanding feats of Matrosov will be forever recorded in Korean history.

　　The Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer forces have won the honor of being heroic armies. To date, 431 soldiers and officers have been awarded the high title of Hero of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, 488,239 soldiers have been awarded various orders and medals of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and many workers and peasants who have performed dedicated labor in the rear have been commended.

　　The Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer forces have inflicted great losses on the aggressors who attempted to conquer our people with cannons and swords. In the three years of the war, 989,391 enemies were killed, wounded, or captured, including 380,773 American troops (the U.S. military losses in the four-year Pacific War during World War II were 170,596), 580,644 Syngman Rhee puppet troops, and 27,974 others; 5,431 enemy planes were shot down, and 6,033 enemy planes were damaged; 163 enemy warships were sunk, and 93 enemy warships were damaged; 2,565 tanks and 3,825 vehicles were destroyed and damaged, as well as 1,188 various guns; 327 tanks, 8,987 vehicles, 145 armored vehicles, 10 airplanes, 5,879 various guns, 110,238 various sniper weapons, and many other combat equipment and ammunition were seized.

　　All the achievements of the Korean people are inseparable from the leadership of the honorable Korean Workers' Party and our people's beloved leader Marshal Kim Il-sung.

　　Our wise leader stands in front of our people, directly leading the country and the people's life and activities of various undertakings. This is the infinite happiness of the Korean people. Comrade Kim Il-sung often guides the strength of the Workers' Party and all the people to the correct path of building a free and happy life, and correctly solves and is solving extremely important and complex issues in our country's domestic and foreign policies.

　　Under the leadership of Comrade Kim Il-sung, the Korean Workers' Party organizes the people to consolidate the people's democratic system and guides the people to fight for the unification of the motherland. Under the leadership of Comrade Kim Il-sung, the People's Army was created and armed, and the political education and military education work of the People's Army was organized. Marshal Kim Il-sung has the talent to achieve the final victory of the Korean people's national liberation struggle. He has cultivated military cadres who are loyal to the motherland and the people.

　　The Workers' Party is the guiding force of the Fatherland Unification Democratic Front. For the consolidation of the democratic system and for the unification, autonomy, and independence of the motherland, the Workers' Party gathers various democratic parties and social organizations around itself. The Workers' Party, led by the wise leader Comrade Kim Il-sung, guides the Korean people's Liberation War.

　　As Marshal Kim Il-sung emphasized, the political and spiritual support and material assistance given to us by the People's Republic of China and other friendly people's democratic countries, headed by the great Soviet Union, are one of the most important factors for our achievements in the struggle against the American aggressors. The people of the countries of the peace and democracy camp, headed by the great Soviet Union, are assisting our people with food, clothing, shoes, and medicine. The progressive people of the whole world have widely launched protest movements against the American beasts in Korea, demanding the cessation of military operations and the conclusion of an armistice agreement. Their spiritual support is of great significance.

　　The assistance given to us by the great neighbor, the fraternal Chinese people, in the struggle to defeat the enemy is noble. The long-standing friendship between the Korean and Chinese people is today further consolidated by the blood of their sons and daughters fighting in Korea for the common enemy—American imperialism—and for common goals and interests. The Korean people will never forget the fraternal assistance given by the Chinese people during the difficult period when the Korean people were deciding their own democratic freedom and national independence.

　　The Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers have given the enemy heavy blows militarily and politically. It is precisely because of this that the American imperialists have been forced to accept the proposal for holding armistice negotiations in Korea put forward by the Soviet representative to the United Nations, Malik. As everyone knows, the continuous provocative acts of the U.S. military headquarters have delayed the negotiations for more than a year and a half and have interrupted the armistice negotiations several times. The American imperialists, who suffered a shameful defeat in the war of aggression against our people, had no choice but to discuss the peace proposals put forward by the Korean and Chinese sides again in April of this year.

　　Life itself confirms the great Stalin's genius prediction, who is the liberator and intimate friend of the Korean people: "If Britain and the United States finally reject the Chinese People's Government's peace proposals, then the Korean War can only end in the defeat of the interventionists."

　　All the Korean people are welcoming the third anniversary of the great Liberation War for the freedom and independence of their motherland, and have further united around the Workers' Party and their leader Marshal Kim Il-sung. The Korean people are confident of the final victory of their just cause.

    朝鲜人民军为祖国自由独立英勇斗争的三周年
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国民族保卫相　崔庸健次帅
    美帝国主义者和李承晚匪帮开始进行反对我国爱好和平人民的罪恶的侵略战争，已经过去三年了。美帝国主义者们所拟订的政治及军事的战略计划的完全失败，是这个战争的基本总结。现在，侵略者们的军队正在他们背信弃义地发动进攻的三八线附近停留了好久而无法前进。
    朝鲜人民的英勇斗争确凿地证明：任何力量也屈服不了保卫着自己祖国的自由、独立和荣誉以及各项民主成果而对胜利具有坚强的志向和信念的自由人民。朝鲜人民军和兄弟般的中国人民志愿军一起，从美帝国主义者的侵略中捍卫我们祖国，保障中国国境的安全，对全世界人民表明：这不是对侵略者们的让步与鼓励，而是对和平捣乱者们的决定性的打击和压力。
    美帝国主义者过去三年间在朝鲜进行的战争，是他们侵略的对外政策和军事侵略集团的形成及准备新的世界战争政策的直接结果。美帝国主义者开始侵朝战争，并确定了如此广泛的目的，即企图以战争来征服我国，变朝鲜人民为其奴隶，获得便于侵略苏联和中华人民共和国的战略桥头堡，并把美国的经济转变为军事体制来防止将要到来的经济危机。
    美帝国主义者们很早以前就开始了以武力来颠覆朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的侵略准备。这已被在和平时期里发表的很多有根据的资料所证实。甚至于连美国的反动“生活”杂志也说，美利坚合众国统治集团的计划中预定在“几天”以内就在朝鲜结束战争。它并自满地作了如下的报道：“在美国的历史上，任何时候的一次战争开始的准备，也没有像这次战争所准备的那样充分。现在，只要看一下战争开始以后的几个星期的情况，就可知道我们在朝鲜的军队，比之我们在日本袭击珍珠港十一个月以后的一九四二年十二月为进攻北非时所派遣的，有着更多的士兵和武器。”
    按照准备战争的美军司令部的计划，预定由美国装备和美国的教官所训练出来的李承晚傀儡军队发动侵略战争。如在我们人民军解放汉城时所缴获的文件中所暴露的一样，敌人在好久以前就已经制订了反对朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的进攻计划。根据这个计划，他们企图派两支李承晚军队，在海军陆战队的协同作战下向北面总的方向进击，进入三八线以北，占领平壤；其后，再继续向中国国境进攻。
    美帝国主义者已经预料到李承晚伪军担当不了侵略朝鲜北半部人民的任务。在这种情况下，美利坚合众国便以“援助”受“侵略”的李承晚政权为借口，决定采取直接的武装干涉的策划。美国现任国务卿——臭名远扬的杜勒斯，在发动战争的前夕，滞留在南朝鲜。他对李承晚作了下面的指示：立刻开始“北伐”，同时要假作宣传说北朝鲜先进攻了南朝鲜。你只要能维持两个星期，那么以后的形势将是顺利的。因为在这个期间，美利坚合众国要非难向南朝鲜进攻的北朝鲜，那时，美国为了朝鲜民族可出动陆军、海军和空军。
    美国侵略者妄想“一下子击溃”我们人民军，征服朝鲜人民，抹煞我国的人民民主制度的计划，就是这样。然而，尽管美帝国主义者在战争开始后即调遣在数量上、技术上和装备上都比朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的武装力量占优势的莫大的武装力量到朝鲜来，但是，这种冒险计划已经遭到了完全破产的命运。
    美国掠夺者们主要的失策，在于没有估计到朝鲜人民无穷无尽的力量，没有估计到捍卫自己的自由独立的朝鲜人民的钢铁般的意志和勇敢精神，和他们为争取自己祖国的自由幸福的不屈不挠的斗志。
    爱好自由的朝鲜都一致地奋起进行神圣的祖国解放战争，给了掠夺者们以歼灭性的打击。李承晚伪军在突然侵入共和国北半部以后迅速被击溃，不仅暴露了李承晚傀儡政权的腐败和南朝鲜反动军队的无能，而且预示了美帝国主义的侵略政策在我们祖国的失败。为维护我国人民的民主建设成就和捍卫自己祖国的自由独立的高尚意志所鼓舞的年青的人民军，在战争的头两个月里就解放了全部南朝鲜百分之九十以上的地区。美国人对反人民的李承晚制度及其军队的期望完全破产了。由于人民军强有力的打击，傀儡政权崩溃了。李承晚政府把它的丧失了斗志而仓惶退却的军队留在后面，魂飞魄散地逃跑了。南朝鲜人民从美帝国主义的压迫下被解放出来，又重新得到了曾在一九四五年从我们祖国驱逐了日本掠夺者的伟大的苏维埃军队的手中得到过的自由与幸福。我国人民的英明领袖金日成元帅在一九五零年七月八日说：“假若没有美帝国主义者直接的武装干涉，那么美帝国主义走狗在我祖国发动的内战，便会早已结束，我祖国的统一，便会早已完成，南半部人民会早已从李承晚匪帮的反动的警察统治下完全获得解放。”
    华尔街的统治者们，看到了李承晚军队不可避免的溃灭的到来与人民军在短期内解放南朝鲜全部领土的时间的迫近，便出现在舞台上，以联合国的旗帜为幌子，向我国人民开始进行直接的武装干涉。同时，美国海军占领了中国的领土——台湾。但是，侵略我们祖国的美国干涉者们，也扭转不了局势。勇敢的人民军强有力地打击了美国精锐的师团，把他们驱逐到朝鲜半岛南端的釜山港口，美国侵略者陷入了要被直接赶出朝鲜半岛的危险境地。
    为挽救这种局势，美军司令部总动员了在太平洋区域的全部陆海空军，甚至把地中海舰队的一部分也调到朝鲜海面，投入全部力量，企图镇压我国人民。一九五零年九月，作为所谓“最后的也是决定性的攻击”的开端，美国指挥部宣称的仁川登陆作战开始了。这样便在前线造成了极其严重的形势。由于和敌人在军事装备及部队的数量上都有显著的差异，朝鲜人民军不得不作撤退。但是，美国指挥部关于全面胜利的傲慢的豪语却立即在军事行动的过程中被推翻了。
    美军的前进，不是为了击溃和消灭退却的对方武力而进行的平行的追击，而是冒险家们狂热地追求迅速和容易的胜利的疯狂突进。朝鲜人民军和伟大的中国人民为了支援人民军而派来的兄弟般的中国人民志愿军一道，在向中国边境突进的干涉军的侧翼，组织了大部队，沉重地打击和追击侵略者。只两个月的期间，就在三八线以北的全部地区完全扫荡了敌人。朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军部队，在强有力的反击过程中进行了一连串的围歼敌人的胜利作战。这些作战证实了指挥官的长成和朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军战斗员们的功绩。美国军队及其附庸国家军队连续败退了二百多公里，直到三八线上企图抵抗时为止。继续败退的美国军队只能在这条线上稍微整顿了一下战斗部署，就转入了防御战。
    此后，美军指挥部曾不断叫嚷所谓“决定性的”、“最后的”冬季、夏季、春季和秋季攻势。企图进行报复。但是众所周知，所有这些进攻每次都彻底失败了。美帝国主义侵略军遭受了致命的打击。奋起维护自己的民主成果的朝鲜人民阻挡了侵略者们的冒险道路。美帝国主义者不仅在军事上而且在政治、道德上也逐渐遭到了失败。
    美国总统艾森豪威尔傲慢地声明，美军的武装力量“能够制霸全世界”。这一声明，对于英雄地坚决地抗击着外国侵略者及其侵略计划并予它们以实际教训的我国，也是傲慢的胡说。为军事失败而慌乱的美国侵略者，对朝鲜和平居民与朝鲜人民军及中国人民志愿军的被俘人员制造了野兽般的暴行。干涉者们在朝鲜的土地上制造着比希特勒的惨无人道的罪行还要可怕的罪恶。而当凝固汽油弹、枪毙和死亡营都不能给美国侵略者带来胜利时，于是它们就在朝鲜使用了为人类所谴责和咒骂的细菌武器。梦想制霸世界的美国，企图把一九四九年七月四日华盛顿“纽约先驱论坛报”所登载的它的思想，在我国加以实现。该报写道：“在现代战争中，我们必须毁灭敌人的民族，击灭它的力量，在地球上永远抹煞它……。让我们为了屠杀摇篮里的儿童、祷告着的婆婆和工作着的工人而派遣载满原子弹、细菌弹和威力大的炸药的飞机。”
    侵略者企图以霍乱、伤寒和其他传染杀人的疾病的病菌，来消灭我们英雄的人民。但是，美国侵略者们不能抹煞我们人民意志的勇敢性和我们人民对自由的志向与对压制者的憎恶心。朝鲜人民不顾侵略者们进行的疯狂的战争手段，坚持了斗争，而且使可恨的敌人在军事、政治与道德上遭到严重的损失。我国英雄的人民在反对以美利坚合众国为首的帝国主义联合势力的解放战争中，揭穿了美帝国主义者的假面具，使它在全世界面前成为亚洲人民的宪兵和刽子手。
    我国人民在三年间为什么能够对抗帝国主义者狂暴的军事压力，并给予它们以军事、政治和道德上的打击呢？
    因为我国人民进行正义的祖国解放战争，来维护自己祖国的自由和民族独立，所以在与帝国主义侵略者的斗争中胜利了。
    美帝国主义者所挑拨的战争的过程已证实了人民民主制度的坚固性和我们祖国南北半部广大人民群众对这个制度的一致支持。
    我国的前线和后方已成为一个统一的战斗阵营。全朝鲜人民坚决而勇敢地支持着朝鲜人民军，尽一切力量来消灭外国侵略者和李承晚卖国匪帮。
    百分之四十的工人，早在战争初期就响应朝鲜劳动党的号召，志愿参加了军队和游击队。工人成了我们共和国的武装力量的基本核心。留在后方的工人们，在劳动战线上英雄地斗争着。在奔赴前线的丈夫和哥哥们的岗位上，站着代替他们的妻子、姐妹和弟弟。遭受轰炸时，工人们冒着生命的危险，抢救机器和设备，扑灭火灾。
    解放了的农民，在人民的国家给予的土地上，忘我地工作着。他们在战时困难和生产上的劳动力不足的条件下，仍保证了我们朝鲜人民军和后方人民不至于遭受很大的粮食困难。他们在去年获得了丰收，在今年又扩大了播种面积，并在更加有组织地进行着田间作业。人民军和中国人民志愿军战斗员们，在播种和收获的突击工作中，给了农民以莫大的帮助。
    受美国奴役的可怕威胁，更进一步加强了人民的祖国统一民主主义战线，并使我国人民进一步地团结在敬爱的领袖金日成元帅的周围。
    当祖国的民族的生存面临到威胁的时候，我国人民精神和政治的统一巩固起来了。由于各种民主改革的结果和对解放战争的正义的性质和目的的认识，而成长、发展的这种精神与政治的统一，就成了朝鲜人民力量的源泉。它鼓舞与推动着前线的战士、后方的劳动人民和敌占区的游击队员们。
    全体朝鲜人民，在神圣的斗争中，不断地发挥着这种基于热爱祖国和无限忠诚于人民民主制度的高尚的革命的爱国主义精神。
    在朝鲜劳动党的领导下，人民军已在战斗过程中锻炼成为领会了军事艺术的钢铁军队。劳动党吸收苏联伟大的卫国战争的经验，不断地发展了军队内的勇敢性和坚强性，并培养着在任何条件下都能战胜敌人的能力。人民军和中国人民志愿军部队，已在战争过程中成长为能够粉碎敌人一切侵略企图的强有力的武装力量。
    对于为祖国的自由和独立而斗争的正义信念，是朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军战斗员们的集体英雄主义的源泉。在朝鲜，他们每天都在建立着英雄的功勋。一九五零年九月，防卫月尾岛（在汉城西面）的八百名勇士的不朽业绩，永远放射着光芒。金昌杰、金玉根、李洙福战士，用自己的身体堵住敌人火口，保障了我军攻击部队的胜利前进。树立了马特洛索夫式的卓越功勋的人民军战士的名字，将永垂朝鲜史册。
    朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军部队，已获得英雄军队的荣誉。到现在已有四百三十一名战士和军官荣获朝鲜民主主义人民共和国英雄的高尚称号，四十八万八千二百三十九名军人获得了朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的各种勋章和军功章，很多在后方进行献身性劳动的工人和农民都得到了表扬。
    朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军部队，给了企图用大炮和枪刀来征服我国人民的侵略者以莫大的损失。在三年来的战争中，毙伤俘敌九十八万九千三百九十一名，其中美军三十八万零七百七十三名（在第二次世界大战时期的历时四年的太平洋战争中，美军的损失是十七万零五百九十六名），李承晚伪军五十八万零六百四十四名，其他二万七千九百七十四名；击落敌机五千四百三十一架，击伤敌机六千零三十三架；击沉敌舰船一百六十三艘，击破敌舰船九十三艘；击毁和击伤坦克二千五百六十五辆，汽车三千八百二十五辆，各种炮一千一百八十八门；缴获坦克三百二十七辆，汽车八千九百八十七辆，装甲车一百四十五辆，飞机十架，各种炮五千八百七十九门，各种狙击武器十一万零二百三十八挺以及其他很多的战斗器材与弹药。
    朝鲜人民的一切成就，都是与荣誉的朝鲜劳动党和我们人民敬爱的领袖金日成元帅的领导分不开的。
    我们英明的领袖，站在我们人民的前面，直接领导着国家和人民的生活和各种事业的活动。这是朝鲜人民的无限幸福。金日成同志经常把劳动党和全体人民的力量引导到建设自由幸福生活的正确道路，并正确地解决了和解决着我国对内、对外政策上的极其重要与复杂的问题。
    在金日成同志领导下的朝鲜劳动党，组织人民去巩固人民民主制度，引导人民为祖国的统一而斗争。在金日成同志的领导下，创建并武装了人民军，组织了人民军的政治教育和军事教育的工作。金日成元帅具有使朝鲜人民的民族解放斗争取得最后胜利的才能。他培养了忠于祖国和人民的军事干部。
    劳动党是祖国统一民主主义战线的指导力量，为了民主制度的巩固，为了祖国的统一、自主和独立，劳动党将各民主政党和社会团体集结在自己的周围。英明的领袖金日成同志领导的劳动党，指导着朝鲜人民的解放战争。
    正如金日成元帅所强调的一样，以伟大的苏联为首的中华人民共和国和其他友好的各人民民主国家给予我们的政治与精神上的支援和物质上的援助，是我们在反对美国侵略者的斗争中取得成就的最重要的因素之一。以伟大的苏联为首的和平民主阵营的各国人民以粮食、服装、靴鞋和药品援助着我国人民。全世界进步人类广泛地展开了反对在朝鲜的美国野兽们的抗议运动，要求停止军事行动和缔结停战协定。他们给予我们的精神上的支援，具有巨大的意义。
    我们伟大邻邦、兄弟般的中国人民在战胜敌人的斗争中给予我们的援助是高贵的。朝中人民有悠久历史的友谊关系，今天以他们为反对共同敌人——美帝国主义、为共同的目的和利益而在朝鲜斗争着的儿女们的鲜血更加巩固了。中国人民在朝鲜人民决定自己民主自由与民族独立的命运的艰难时期所给予的兄弟般的援助，朝鲜人民是永远不会忘记的。
    朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军，在军事上和政治上都给了敌人以沉重的打击。正因为这样，才迫使美帝国主义者们不得不接受苏联驻联合国代表马立克所提出的在朝鲜举行停战谈判的建议。大家都知道，美军司令部连续进行的挑衅行为，已使谈判拖延了一年半以上，并曾数次中断了停战谈判。在反对我国人民的侵略战争中遭到可耻失败的美帝国主义者们，到了今年四月才不得不再来讨论朝中方面所提的和平建议。
    生活的本身证实着朝鲜人民的解放者和亲密的朋友——伟大的斯大林的天才预言：“如果英国和美国终于拒绝了中国人民政府的和平建议，那么朝鲜战争便只能以干涉者的失败而告终。”
    全体朝鲜人民迎接为自己祖国的自由独立的伟大的解放战争三周年，已进一步团结在劳动党和自己的领袖金日成元帅的周围，朝鲜人民确信着自己的正义事业的最后胜利。
