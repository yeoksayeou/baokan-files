Grasp the Main Links of Planning Management

    After most factories and mines across the country mobilized the masses to discuss production plans and began to establish and strengthen planning management, some of the chaotic phenomena in enterprise management have been improved. However, uneven production is still the most common and prominent problem in various factories and mines. Taking the Northeast machinery factories under the First Ministry of Machinery Industry as an example, most factories did not complete their May product variety plans, and some factories that completed the plan did so by working overtime and rushing. The reason for this situation is primarily that many units, when strengthening planning management, did not clearly recognize that operation planning is the central link of planning management. Therefore, they did not make the correct formulation of operation plans the center of their work, and did not organize the forces of various parts of the enterprise to implement effective centralized management. That is to say, they did not specify the enterprise's production technology and financial plans, making them operation plans for each workshop, section, group, equipment, month, week, and day and night, and organize their implementation.
    Operation plans are the specific action plans of all employees in the enterprise. With operation plans, the daily production activities of various departments, sections, workshops can be followed, and work can be carried out rhythmically according to the operation schedule. Enterprise leaders can then inspect the work of each workshop, section, and group in a planned and purposeful manner, foresee potential problems and weak links in the production process in the next stage, and calmly prevent problems before they occur. Therefore, to strengthen the planning management of enterprises and improve their management level, it is necessary to start with the establishment of operation plans and grasp this central link to drive other aspects of work.
    However, the formulation of operation plans must not be formalistic, but must be based on the actual situation. Only by formulating operation plans in accordance with the actual situation can they play a role in supervising and guiding the enterprise's production activities. Some enterprises already have operation plans, but enterprise management is still chaotic, mainly because the operation plans are not realistic. Experience proves that to prepare realistic operation plans, it is necessary to base them on national plans, order plans, equipment maintenance and raw material and power supply plans, average advanced quotas, etc., while also considering technical operating procedures, general technical conditions, the promotion of advanced experience, and the completion of production tasks. Only after careful consideration of these factors can the operation plans be realistic. At the same time, to truly promote and supervise production, operation plans must also oppose conservative thinking and departmentalism, and must mobilize all employees to implement them. Because our advocacy of balanced production aims not only to ensure the unconditional completion of national plans, but also to further stimulate the enthusiasm of employees and more fully tap the potential of enterprises, completing national plans ahead of schedule and exceeding them. Some units do not proceed from the needs of the country, refuse temporary tasks, or one-sidedly emphasize the simplification of products, do not produce according to the varieties required by the state, or base themselves on backward quotas, look to weak links, and stockpile too many raw materials. This kind of approach that is for balance's sake alone is wrong and must be opposed.
    Of course, having operation plans is only one aspect of the problem. Whether production can be carried out evenly also depends on whether the supervision of plan execution can be carried out correctly and whether the reasons that prevent enterprises from working normally can be eliminated in a timely manner. Comrade Stalin said: "The drafting of a plan is only the beginning of planning work. Real planning leadership only begins after the plan is drawn up, checked locally, and implemented, revised, and made more precise." (Political Report and Conclusions of the Central Committee at the Sixteenth Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)) It can be seen that having correct operation plans only provides the possibility of achieving balanced production. To turn this possibility into reality, it is also necessary to constantly discover and solve many problems in the process of plan execution. Therefore, while establishing operation plans, it is also necessary to establish a dispatching organization. Without a dispatching organization and dispatching system that guarantees and supervises the implementation of operation plans, even the most accurate operation plans will fall through.
    Operation plans are still a new task for most of our enterprises. Due to the different working conditions and working foundations of various factories and mines, it is impossible and unnecessary to make uniform requirements; but we must grasp this central link to improve enterprise management - this is certain. Some comrades believe that to do a good job in operation plans, it is necessary to immediately achieve balanced production, and if the conditions for balanced production are not available, it is impossible to establish operation plans at all. This is an unrealistic and wrong idea. Because to achieve balanced production, it is necessary to do a good job in all aspects of the enterprise. Balanced production is a sign of the level of enterprise management. The improvement of the level of enterprise management is not something that can be achieved overnight, and the improvement of production balance can only be a gradual process. The more chaotic the enterprise management, the more necessary it is to organize production through operation plans and dispatching systems; the worse the working foundation of the factory and mine, the more necessary it is to grasp this central link and start step by step from the main workshops and gradually promote it to all workshops. Because this is the most practical and effective way to overcome management chaos and improve leadership.
    Some comrades have an unclear understanding of where to start with planning management, mechanically dividing stages, and carrying out rectification of original records in isolation, and carrying out quota work in isolation. They think that if the original record system is not sound and the quotas are not accurate, they cannot start operation plans. But experience proves that this approach is not good. Because the original records established apart from the needs of operation plans often cannot reflect the key problems in production, and therefore cannot play a role in improving production and guiding work. We should see that quotas are not immutable, and the creativity of the masses is infinite. Any new invention or creation or the promotion of an advanced experience will break the quota. We say that the quota is the basis of the operation plan, and only with the average advanced quota can we formulate an advanced operation plan, which is correct; but having an operation plan, in turn, makes it easier to discover the accuracy of the quota, easier to find the average advanced quota, and easier to purposefully guide employees to create advanced quotas. Original records and quota work should be carried out around the operation plan, and a dispatching organization should also be established to ensure the implementation of the operation plan.
    Some comrades believe that since there is a planning management system, political work in the enterprise can be weakened. This view, which opposes political work and economic work, is obviously wrong. With the planning management system, not only can political work not be weakened, on the contrary, only by strengthening publicity and education work, making the masses realize the importance of strengthening planning management, the importance of strengthening labor discipline, and obeying production dispatching, and establishing a firm concept of "planning is law" among the masses, can they consciously fight for the implementation of operation plans. The planning management system further clarifies the production-oriented content of the work of the Party and the masses in the enterprise.
    Now all leading cadres of factories and mines that have begun to implement planning management must clearly recognize the importance of operation plans, and must firmly grasp this main link of operation plans to achieve planning management. We must organize the enthusiasm and creativity of thousands of employees into the daily production activities of balancedly completing national plans through operation plans, and change the backwardness of our enterprise management. This is the common task of the administrative leaders of all enterprises and the organizations of the Party, trade union, and the Communist Youth League; we must realize this task, and we will certainly be able to realize this task.

### 抓住计划管理的主要环节

    抓住计划管理的主要环节
    全国大部分厂矿经过发动群众讨论生产计划，开始转入建立和加强计划管理工作以后，部分企业管理的混乱现象已有若干改进。但是生产不均衡的情况依然是各厂矿当前最普遍和最突出的问题。以第一机械工业部所属东北各机械工厂为例，大部分工厂没有完成五月份的品种计划，部分完成计划的工厂也是靠加班加点突击完成的。造成这种情况的原因，首先在于许多单位在加强计划管理时，没有明确认识到作业计划是计划管理的中心环节。因而就没有把正确制订作业计划当做工作的中心，没有把企业中各个部分的力量组织起来，实行有效的集中管理。这就是说，他们没有把企业生产技术财务计划具体化起来，使它成为每车间、每工段、每小组、每种设备、每月、每周和每昼夜的作业计划，并组织其实现。
    作业计划是企业中全体职工的具体行动计划。有了作业计划，各部门、各科股、各车间的日常生产活动才有所遵循，才可以按照作业进度有节奏地进行工作；企业领导干部才能有计划有目的地检查每一车间、工段、小组的工作，才能预见下一阶段可能发生的问题和生产过程中的薄弱环节，才能从容不迫地防患于未然。因此，加强企业的计划管理，提高企业的管理水平，必须从建立作业计划入手，抓住这一中心环节带动其他方面的工作。
    但是，作业计划的制订决不应该是形式主义的，而必须根据实际情况制订作业计划，才能对企业的生产活动起监督和指导的作用。有些企业已经有了作业计划，但企业管理依然混乱如故，主要原因就在于作业计划不切合实际。经验证明：要编制切合实际的作业计划，必须以国家计划、定货计划、设备检修和原材料和动力供应计划、平均先进定额等为依据，同时考虑到技术操作规程、一般技术条件、先进经验推广情况以及生产任务完成情况。只有周密地考虑了这些因素以后，制订出来的作业计划，才是切合实际的计划。同时，作业计划要能真正起推进和督促生产的作用，还必须反对保守思想和本位主义，必须发动全体职工加以贯彻。因为我们提倡均衡生产的目的不仅是要保证无条件地完成国家计划，而且是要进一步地发挥职工的劳动热情，更充分地发掘企业的潜在力量，提前并超额完成国家的计划。有些单位不从国家需要出发，拒绝临时任务，或者片面地强调产品的单一化，不按国家需要的品种进行生产，或者以落后定额为根据，向薄弱环节看齐，过多地储备原材料，这种为均衡而均衡的作法都是错误的，必须加以反对。
    当然有了作业计划，还只是问题的一方面。能否均衡地进行生产，还取决于能否正确地进行计划执行情况的监督，能否及时地消灭那些使企业不能正常进行工作的原因。斯大林同志说过：“计划的编制仅仅是计划工作的开端。真正的计划领导，只是在计划编成之后，在当地加以检查之后，在计划的实现、修正使之更加精确的过程中才开展起来。”（联共（布）第十六次代表大会上中央委员会的政治报告与结论）由此可见，有了正确的作业计划还只是提供了实现均衡生产的可能性。要把这种可能性变为现实，还要不断地发现和解决计划执行过程中的许多问题。因此，在建立作业计划的同时，还必须把调度机构建立起来。没有保证和监督作业计划执行的调度机构和调度制度，作业计划即使制订得再准确也是会落空的。
    作业计划对于我们的大多数企业说来还是一个新的工作。由于各厂矿工作条件和工作基础不同，不可能也没有必要作统一的要求；但我们必须抓住这一中心环节来改进企业管理工作——这一点是可以肯定的。有的同志认为要搞好作业计划就一定要立即达到均衡生产，如果不具备均衡生产的条件，就根本不能建立作业计划。这是一种不切实际的错误的想法。因为要达到均衡生产，必须把企业的各方面工作都做好。均衡生产是企业管理水平的标志。企业管理水平的提高既不是一朝一夕的事，生产均衡性的提高当然也只能是循序渐进的过程。企业管理愈是混乱，就愈需要通过作业计划和调度制度来组织生产；厂矿的工作基础愈差，就愈需要抓紧这一中心环节，按步就班地从主要车间做起，并逐渐推行到各车间。因为这是克服管理上的混乱现象、提高领导水平的最切实最有效的办法。
    有的同志对于搞计划管理从何着手认识不明确，机械地划分阶段，孤立地进行整顿原始记录，孤立地进行定额工作。他们以为不把原始记录制度搞健全了，不把定额搞准确了，就不能开始搞作业计划。但是经验证明这种做法是不好的。因为脱离了作业计划的需要而建立起来的原始记录，往往不能反映生产中的关键问题，因而也就不能发挥改进生产和指导工作的作用。我们应该看到定额不是一成不变的，群众的创造性是无穷的。任何一个新的发明创造或一个先进经验的推广都会打破定额。我们说定额是作业计划的基础，有了平均先进定额才能订出先进的作业计划，这是对的；但是有了作业计划反过来也更容易发现定额的准确程度，更容易寻找平均先进定额，更容易有目的地引导职工去创造先进定额。原始记录和定额工作应该围绕着作业计划来进行，同时还要建立调度机构以保证作业计划的贯彻。
    有的同志认为既然有了计划管理制度就可以减弱企业内的政治工作了。这种把政治工作和经济工作对立起来的看法显然也是错误的。有了计划管理制度不但不能减弱政治工作，相反的，只有加强宣传教育工作，使群众认识到加强计划管理的重要性，认识到加强劳动纪律、服从生产调度的重要性，在群众中树立了牢固的“计划就是法律”的观念以后，他们才能自觉地为执行作业计划而斗争。计划管理制度给企业内的党和群众的工作进一步明确了面向生产的内容。
    现在所有开始实行计划管理的厂矿的领导干部，都必须明确地认识作业计划的重要性，必须紧紧地抓住作业计划这一个主要环节，去实现计划管理。我们要通过作业计划，把千万职工的积极性和创造性组织到均衡地完成国家计划的日常生产活动中来，改变我们企业管理的落后面貌。这是当前各企业行政领导和党的、工会的、青年团的组织的共同任务；我们必须实现这个任务，也一定能够实现这个任务。
