Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, June 11th: The 12th Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the All-Union Leninist Young Communist League of the Soviet Union recently adopted a decision on the participation of youth league organizations in improving the work of general schools for working and peasant youth. The decision pointed out that thanks to the daily concern of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet government, Soviet schools are growing and consolidating. Schools for working and peasant youth occupy a very important position in raising the general education and cultural level of industrial, transportation, and agricultural youth. More than one million young men and women whose studies were interrupted during the Soviet Patriotic War have received seven-year and ten-year education in these schools. The decision emphasized that many youth league organizations in the Belorussian Republic, Sverdlovsk Oblast, and cities such as Leningrad and Kharkov have done a lot of explanatory work in attracting young people to study in these schools, assisted in consolidating the teaching and material foundation of these schools, and showed comradely concern for the students. The decision also criticized many youth league organizations for not paying attention to schools for working and peasant youth and not helping the people's education institutions to overcome the shortcomings in the work of these schools. The plenary session instructed youth league organizations at all levels to pay attention to schools for working youth and peasant youth, to do their best to support these schools’ students in obtaining seven-year and ten-year education, and to actively assist the people's education institutions in improving the work of schools for working youth and peasant youth. The plenary session suggested that youth organizations at all levels actively participate in the preparation for the new year of schools for working and peasant youth and instructed youth organizations at all levels to strengthen their assistance to national education institutions in improving the teaching work of schools, summarizing and popularizing the experience of outstanding schools for working and peasant youth, preventing students from dropping out of schools for working and peasant youth, and improving the work of part-time secondary schools.

    责成团组织参加改进工农青年学校的工作
    【新华社莫斯科十一日电】苏联列宁共产主义青年团中央委员会第十二次全体会议日前通过了关于青年团组织参加改进工农青年普通学校的工作的决定。决定指出：由于苏联共产党和苏维埃政府的日常关怀，苏联学校在增长和巩固着。在提高工业、运输业和农业青年的普通教育和文化的水平方面，工农青年学校占很重要的地位。在苏联卫国战争期间中断了学习的一百多万男女青年，已在这些学校受到了七年制和十年制教育。决定强调指出：白俄罗斯共和国、斯维德洛夫斯克州和列宁格勒、哈尔科夫等城市的许多青年团组织在吸引青年到这些学校学习时进行了很多解释工作，协助巩固了这些学校的教学和物质的基础，并对学生们表现了同志般的关怀。决定同时批评了许多青年团组织不重视工农青年学校，没有很好帮助人民教育的机构克服这些学校工作中的缺点。全体会议责成各级青年团组织注意工农学校，尽力支持这些学校的学生取得七年制和十年制教育，积极协助人民教育的机构改进工农青年学校的工作。全体会议建议各级团组织积极参加新年度工农青年学校的准备工作，并责成各级团组织加强帮助国民教育机构改进学校的教学工作，总结和普及优秀的工农学校的经验，防止工农学校学生辍学，改进业余中学的工作。
