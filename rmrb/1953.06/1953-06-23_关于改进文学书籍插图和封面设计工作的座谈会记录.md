Record of a Symposium on Improving Illustration and Cover Design of Literary Books

On May 4th, this newspaper published Comrade Wang Chaowen's article "On Illustrations in Literary Books" and a brief commentary in "Cultural Life" entitled "Improving Illustrations and Cover Design of Literary Books," which criticized the lack of illustrations or the crude and perfunctory illustrations in currently published literary works, as well as the generalized and monotonous cover designs. This has attracted the attention of the publishing and art communities. To exchange opinions on improving this aspect of work, this newspaper held a symposium on June 8th. Attendees included leaders from the People's Publishing House, People's Literature Publishing House, China Youth Publishing House, editorial departments of "People's Literature," "Liberation Army Literature," "Liberation Army Pictorial," "China Youth," "New Observer," Baowentang Bookstore, and artists Cai Ruohong, Wang Chaowen, Hua Junwu, Gu Yuan, Situ Qiao, Xin Mang, Su Jian, Chen Xinghua, Yu Feng, A Lao, and others, totaling thirty-three people. They reflected readers' demands for the current illustration and cover work of literary readings and raised opinions on the phenomenon of publishers, editors, and some leaders not valuing illustration art, as well as on cultivating professional illustration talents and organizing creative forces.

Readers Demand Improvement in Illustration and Cover Design of Literary Readings

Readers are dissatisfied with the decline of illustration art and the generalization of cover design in current literary readings. Comrades who attended the symposium reflected that many publishing houses and magazine offices often receive opinions from readers requesting excellent illustrations in literary readings and beautiful cover designs that match the content and nature of the books and periodicals.

Some of the books published by the People's Literature Publishing House have begun to include illustrations, but some of the illustrations are not very well drawn, and they plan to organize painters to take on this work. The "artistic fonts" used on the covers of their books have a common problem of being generalized and failing to express the excellent traditions of Chinese calligraphy. In the past, "People's Literature" used to publish one or two pages of paintings or woodcuts in each issue, which readers loved and hoped would be published regularly in the future. In the past, the magazine had illustrations for literary works, but not frequently enough or of sufficient quality; its cover patterns and layout were somewhat rigid, old-fashioned, and not lively; the table of contents at the beginning of each issue was routinely marked with two thick black lines above and below, which readers found unsatisfactory.

Liu Lun from the "Liberation Army Literature" said that they had conducted a survey on whether readers liked illustrations, and the result was that the vast majority of readers requested the magazine to greatly increase the number of illustrations. Lu Enyi, an artist from the Cultural Department of the Political Department of the People's Liberation Army Navy, said that the Naval Political Department attached importance to this work, and that soldiers liked illustrations very much. After the "Naval Soldiers' Newspaper" was distributed to the soldiers, many soldiers first looked at the articles with illustrations, and read the articles without illustrations later. The soldiers often wrote letters pointing out which illustrations were well-drawn and which were not, and they were extremely concerned about paintings and illustrations.

The People's Publishing House publishes books on politics, economics, and other topics. In the past, they had emphasized using some patterns with national forms to decorate the covers, and their understanding of how cover design should match the content of the book was not clear enough. They also often drew frames or five-pointed stars on the covers, which appeared rigid and monotonous, and readers were naturally even more dissatisfied. The comrades of the publishing house themselves were also dissatisfied, calling it a "lifesaving star" and "lifesaving frame." They are currently learning from the advanced experience of Soviet book design, improving their business, and preparing to improve the problem of generalized book covers.

In the past, "China Youth's" covers mostly used photos and patterns, which were not lively and lacked features. Zhao Juxian of the publishing house said: "The criticism in the newspaper has made us more aware of the importance of doing a good job in the cover design of periodicals. In the past, when we selected photos for the cover, we did not match the content of the publication, and we had the same problem when we used patterns later. In the future, on the one hand, we will ask artists to design the cover for us, and on the other hand, we will try to find photos that are suitable for the content of the publication."

At the same time, everyone talked about the issue of each publishing house and periodical having its own publishing style and editing style; this should be required not only from the content of the readings but also from the cover design and layout. Lou Shiyi of the People's Literature Publishing House, Lü Jian of "People's Literature" magazine, Zhang Qiya of the People's Publishing House, and artist Gu Yuan, who attended the meeting, all talked about the issue of the style of publications. They believe that many publishing houses and periodicals have not yet formed their own unique style. Lou Shiyi said: "What kind of style should the People's Literature Publishing House form? The general direction has not yet been determined. Readers' requirements for cover design and illustrations are various; some like bright reds and greens, while others like simple and elegant styles. We ourselves hope to form a simple and elegant style." He believes that the covers of books should also be differentiated according to different literary styles such as poetry, novels, and drama. Gu Yuan believes that whether the cover of a book or periodical should be simple or fancy depends on the target audience. For example, "People's Literature" is different from general popular readings, and its target audience is mainly literary workers, so the cover design does not have to be bright red and green, and it is better to be more simple.

Overcoming the Phenomenon of Not Valuing Illustration Art

How to improve the backward situation of illustration art in literary readings is an urgent problem to be solved, and the solution of this problem requires the close cooperation of publishers, editors, and artists. Everyone should strive to meet the broad readership's demand for illustration art. Currently, most publishers and editors do not pay enough attention to this work. Many comrades at the meeting reflected that the status of illustrations in publications is often squeezed by the printing type. Some illustrations are shrunk very small and printed unclearly, some do not even print the names of the illustrators, some cut off a part of a painting to accommodate the "specifications" of the publication, and some even dig out the background of pencil drawings for the convenience of plate making. Some painters have created illustrations for literary works, which were published in the first edition but were canceled without reason in the reprinting. For example, the illustrations that Gu Yuan made for Zhou Libo's novel "Hurricane" were in this situation. The illustrations that Cai Ruohong made for other literary readings were also used intermittently. There are many such situations. This phenomenon of not valuing the labor of painters hinders the creative enthusiasm and the improvement of creative quality of painters, and affects the development of illustration art. It should be quickly corrected. Illustration art should be given its due status in literary readings.

The common difficulty felt by the painters who attended the meeting was that there was too little creation time. Currently, we do not have professional illustrators. Those who draw illustrations generally serve in certain agencies and groups, and the work tasks of their positions are heavy. Drawing illustrations for publications requires squeezing spare time, so some painters feel it is a burden. In addition, some leaders of units have departmentalism and have a narrow view of the work tasks of cadres. They do not fully understand the social significance of illustration art and create a bad atmosphere around the painters, making the painters feel that the paintings they make for non-unit work are "illegitimate children." Everyone agreed that the responsible comrades of this unit should be urged to change this incorrect thinking. Painting for publications is the social responsibility of painters. In addition to completing the work tasks of their positions, the leadership should not only not stop them but also have the responsibility to encourage and assist painters to paint for publications. When necessary, this part of the painter's work should also be included in the painter's overall work plan.

There are also some shortcomings in our current publishing and editing work, which have caused difficulties for painters in their creative work. For example, some publishers and magazine editors usually do not know enough about what certain painters are good at and what they are willing to paint. They often simply ask for manuscripts and urge for manuscripts, and the time for soliciting manuscripts is very short, leaving painters with little time to think fully. The "New Observer" magazine often has this situation. Some painters have to rush overnight to complete the paintings in order to submit the manuscripts on time, which is very harmful to the improvement of the quality of the paintings. As A Lao said: "The time for soliciting manuscripts is very tight, and it is not easy to draw the image correctly, let alone artistic integrity." The painters also expressed that to draw good illustrations, they must have certain life experiences, especially to carefully study literary works. Li Zongjin said that after reading the Soviet novel "A Real Man," some images and scenes were aroused in his mind, which were based on his own life experiences, but after seeing the illustrations of "A Real Man" drawn by the Soviet Zhukov, he felt that there was a big difference from his initial imagination. He said: "If you don't carefully study literary works before making illustrations, it is difficult to draw well, and sometimes it may even distort the images in the works." Cai Ruohong said: "If you don't give painters sufficient time, it seems that you value painters on the surface, thinking that painters can do it at once, but in fact, you don't value them, treating painters as craftsmen, which seriously violates the laws of creation."

Regarding how to improve this situation, many people expressed their opinions. Xi Ye said: "Editors should fully grasp the characteristics of painters to solicit manuscripts." Situ Qiao said: "In the future, when the organization of the All-China Artists Association is sound, it should do more work in this area, learn more about the specialties of painters and their creative interests in a certain area, and introduce and recommend them to publishers and editors to make the creation of illustration art flourish." Hua Junwu believes that publishing houses and magazines should strengthen organizational work, understand the characteristics of painters, and have their own work plans, solicit manuscripts from painters earlier, and give painters a relatively sufficient creative time.

Cultivating Illustration Talents and Organizing Creative Forces

The lack of good illustrations in current literary readings is closely related to the lack of illustration talents and the failure to organize creative forces well. Situ Qiao, Gu Yuan, and others believe that it is necessary to cultivate professional illustration talents. Lou Shiyi said that they want to spend two or three years selecting one or two books by Lu Xun to make exquisite illustrations, but the current difficulty is that they cannot find suitable people to draw. Gu Yuan believes that publishing houses should be determined to spend several years making good illustrations for Chinese classical works and good novels and publishing exquisite versions. It is necessary to specialize illustrators, train them to be familiar with life, and improve their painting ability. Situ Qiao said that the cultivation of illustration painters should not only start from the existing illustration talents but also hope that the Central Academy of Fine Arts will train more talents in this area, and the teaching plan should include illustration courses. Xi Ye said that Soviet illustrators have won Stalin Prizes, and we should also greatly promote illustration art and change the current situation of illustration "lacking literary flavor." We should make more efforts in this regard. Wang Chaowen believes that drawing illustrations is a good way for painters to improve their professional level. Departmentalism on the part of the leadership of certain units is certainly a problem, but it is also important for painters to actively strive to draw more illustrations. Many truly accomplished painters have drawn illustrations. Drawing more illustrations can at least indirectly enrich the painter's life experience and improve creative skills. The life in literary works is not a natural form of life, but a more concentrated and generalized artistic depiction. Drawing more illustrations will help us learn how to reflect life and will not hinder the development of special artistic techniques. He believes that the leadership should also focus on illustration when training art cadres. Publishing houses and magazines should strengthen contact with painters and organize forces. It is also possible to jointly formulate plans for making illustrations and cover designs with students from the Central Academy of Fine Arts within a certain period of time. If the paintings are well done, they can solve part of the supply problem, and students can also regard it as an aspect of business learning. In order to improve the professional level of illustrators and communicate the relationship between publishers, editors, and artists, he suggested holding illustration viewing sessions at regular intervals to appreciate works and discuss creation.

Yu Feng said that regardless of which department they work in, comrades who can draw should be mobilized to take an active attitude and draw more. Even if they cannot be published, they can be used as practice. She said: "Now publishers and editors are asking us for manuscripts, and there are very few times when painters submit their own manuscripts. This situation should be changed."

Situ Qiao and Liu Lun both believe that for the work of illustrating literary works, painters need to have good literary cultivation and basic life knowledge. They hope that painters can study well and be familiar with life. Other comrades also added that painters should also attach importance to using indirect experience, study life more, and read literary works regularly.

Finally, Cai Ruohong, on behalf of the All-China Artists Association, said that this symposium was a good start, showing that the publishing community and artists attach importance to this work. In the future, the painting group of the All-China Artists Association will first discuss the issue of illustrations, especially the issue of the expression methods of illustration art, and will continue to discuss and study.

    关于改进文学书籍插图和封面设计工作的座谈会记录
    五月四日本报发表了王朝闻同志的“谈文学书籍的插图”一文，并发表了文化生活简评“改进文学书籍的插图和封面设计”，对目前出版的文学读物缺少插图或插图画得粗糙、潦草、以及封面设计一般化、单调乏味的现象提出了批评，引起了出版界和美术界的注意。为了交换改进这一方面工作的意见，本报于六月八日召开了座谈会。出席的包括：人民出版社、人民文学出版社、中国青年出版社、“人民文学”、“解放军文艺”、“解放军画报”、“中国青年”、“新观察”编辑部、宝文堂书店等单位负责人以及美术工作者蔡若虹、王朝闻、华君武、古元、司徒乔、辛莽、苏坚、陈兴华、郁风、阿老等三十三人。大家反映了读者对目前文学读物的插图和封面工作的要求，并对出版者、编辑者和部分领导人不重视插图艺术的现象以及对培养专业的插图人材、组织创作力量等问题都提出了意见。
    读者要求改进文学读物的插图和封面设计
    读者对目前文学读物中插图艺术的衰落、封面设计的一般化是不满意的。参加座谈会的同志们反映，许多出版社、杂志社都常接到读者的意见，他们要求有优秀的插图出现在文学读物中，并有美观而又与书刊内容、性质吻合的封面设计。
    人民文学出版社出版的书籍有的已开始作插图，但有些插图画得还不大好，即将有计划地组织画家担任这一工作。他们所出书籍的封面用的“美术字”，有一般化的毛病，表现不出中国书法的优秀传统。“人民文学”过去每期曾刊印一两页绘画或木刻，读者很喜爱，并希望今后能经常刊出。过去该刊曾有过文学作品插图，但不经常，也不够精美；它的封面图案和编排格式都有些呆板、老气、不活泼；卷首的目录栏每期照例是上下加两条粗黑线，读者感到不满足。
    “解放军文艺”社刘仑说，他们曾就读者喜不喜爱插图的问题作过一次调查，结果绝大多数读者要求该刊大量增加插图。解放军海军政治部文化部的美术工作者吕恩谊说海军政治部重视这一工作，而且战士非常喜欢插图，“海军战士报”发到战士中去后，很多战士首先看的是有插图的文章，没有插图的文章慢一些看；战士们经常写信提出那些插图画得好，那些画得不好，他们对绘画、插图是极为关心的。
    人民出版社是出版政治、经济等方面的书籍的。他们过去的封面曾强调用民族形式的一些图案来装饰，对封面设计如何与书的内容配合的问题，认识不够明确。他们也时常在封面上画框框或五角星；显得呆板、单调，读者当然更不满意。该社的同志自己也不满意，把这叫做“救命星”“救命框”。他们目前正在学习苏联装帧的先进经验，提高自己的业务，准备改进目前书籍封面一般化的毛病。
       “中国青年”的封面过去多用照片和图案，不活泼，没有特色。该社的赵举贤说：“报纸的批评使我们提高了对作好刊物封面设计的认识。过去我们选照片作封面，没有做到配合刊物的内容，以后采用图案也有此毛病。今后我们一方面请美术工作者给我们设计封面，另一方面尽量找适合刊物内容的照片。”
    同时，大家谈到每个出版社、期刊都应有自己的出版风格和编辑风格的问题；这不仅从读物的内容去要求，而也从封面设计和编排形式等方面努力。到会的人民文学出版社楼适夷、“人民文学”杂志社吕剑、人民出版社张启亚、美术家古元都谈到出版物的风格问题。他们认为目前不少出版社、期刊尚没有形成自己独有的风格。楼适夷说：“人民文学出版社应形成什么样的风格，总的方向尚未确定。读者对封面设计和插图的要求是各式各样的，有的喜欢大红大绿，有的喜欢朴素、典雅。我们自己希望能形成朴素、典雅的风格。”他认为书籍的封面也应按不同的文艺样式如诗歌、小说、戏剧等而有所区分。古元认为书刊封面的应素应花，要看读者对象而定，如“人民文学”与一般的通俗读物不同，它的对象主要是文艺工作者，封面设计不必大红大绿，比较朴素些好。
    克服不重视插图艺术的现象
    如何改进文学读物中插图艺术的落后状况，是目前急待解决的问题，这一问题的解决首先需要出版者、编辑者、美术工作者的密切合作。大家都应为满足广大读者对插图艺术的要求而努力。目前一般出版者和编辑者对这一工作是不够重视的。会上不少同志反映，插图在出版物中的地位往往受铅字的排挤，有的把插图缩得很小，印出来模糊不清，有的连插图作者的名字也不印上，有的为了迁就出版物的“规格”把一幅画削去了一部分刊登，有的为了制版方便，竟把铅笔画的背景给挖去了。有的画家为文学作品作了插图，初版时刊印出来，再版时被无故取消了，如古元曾为周立波的小说“暴风骤雨”作的插图，就是这种情形。蔡若虹曾为别的文学读物作的插图，也是时有时无地被刊用着。诸如此类的情况是很多的。这种不重视画家劳动的现象妨碍了画家的创作热情和创作质量的提高，影响了插图艺术的发展，应该迅速加以纠正。在文学读物中应给插图艺术以应有的地位。
    到会的画家共同感到的困难是创作时间太少。目前我们还没有职业的插图画家，画插图的一般都服务于一定的机关和团体，本岗位的工作任务繁重，为出版物画插图需要挤业余时间，所以有些画家感到是种负担。加之有些单位的领导人有本位主义思想，对干部的工作任务有狭隘的看法，对插图艺术的社会意义认识不足，在画家周围造成一种不良气氛，使画家感到为非本单位作的画是“私生子”。大家一致认为应该促使本单位负责同志改变此种不正确的思想。为出版物绘画是画家的社会责任，画家除完成他本岗位的工作任务外，领导方面不但不应阻止，而且有责任鼓励和协助画家为出版物作画。必要时，画家的这部分工作也应列入画家总的工作计划内。
    我们目前的出版、编辑工作中也存在一些缺点，给画家在创作工作上造成了困难。如有些出版工作者、杂志编辑平时对某些画家擅长些什么，愿意画些什么，了解不够。常常只是简单地拉稿、催稿，而且约稿的时间很短促，使画家很少有时间作充分的思考。“新观察”杂志社就常有这种情况。有的画家为了按期交稿，只好匆匆忙忙连夜赶画，这对绘画质量的提高是很有害处的。如阿老说：“约稿时间很紧，能够把形象画正确些就已经不容易了，更谈不到艺术上的完整。”画家们也表示：要画好插图，
    必须具备一定的生活经验，特别是认真研究文学作品。李宗津说：他看苏联小说“真正的人”后，在脑子里引起了一些形象和场面，这些都是根据自己的生活经验引起的，但他看到苏联茹科夫画的“真正的人”的插图后，觉得与自己最初的想像有很大不同。他说：“如不仔细研究文学作品就作插图，很难画好，有时甚至会歪曲作品中的形象。”蔡若虹说：“如不给画家以充裕的时间，看起来，表面上是重视画家，觉得画家可以一挥而就，实际上是不重视，把画家看成画匠，严重地违反创作规律。”
    关于如何改进这种现状，不少人发表了意见。西野说：“编辑应充分掌握画家的特长去约稿。”司徒乔说：“今后中华全国美术工作者协会的机构健全了，应多在这方面做些工作，多了解画家的特长和某一方面的创作兴趣，介绍、推荐给出版者、编辑者，使插图艺术的创作兴旺起来。” 华君武认为出版社、杂志社应掌握加强组织工作，了解画家的特长，并应有自己的工作计划，早些向画家约稿，给画家以比较充裕的创作时间。
    培养插图人材，组织创作力量
    目前文学读物中缺少好的插图，与插图人材的缺乏和没有很好地组织创作力量很有关系。司徒乔、古元等认为有培养专业的插图人材的必要。楼适夷说，他们想花二年、三年的时间，把鲁迅的书选一两本作精美的插图，但目前的困难是找不到适当的人画。古元认为出版社应下决心花几年时间，对中国的古典作品和好的小说作好的插图，出精美的版本。使插图工作者专业化，培养他们熟悉生活，提高绘画能力是必要的。司徒乔说，培养插图画家不但从现有的插图人材着手，也希望中央美术学院多培养这方面的人材，教学计划内应包括插图课程。西野说，苏联的插图家有得斯大林奖金的，我们也应大大提倡插图艺术，并改变目前的插图“文学气味不足”的情况。我们应在这方面多努力。王朝闻认为画插图是画家提高自己业务水平的好办法，某些单位领导方面的本位主义固然是问题，而画家主动争取多画插图也很重要，许多真正有成就的画家，多是画过插图的。多画插图至少可以间接地丰富画家的生活经验，提高创作技巧。文学作品中的生活，它不是自然形态的生活，而是更集中、更概括了的艺术的描写，多画插图，会帮助我们学习应该如何反映生活的知识，也不妨碍美术的特殊技巧的发挥。他认为领导方面培养美术干部也应着重插图。出版社、杂志社应与绘画者加强联系，把力量组织起来。也可以与中央美术学院的学生在一定时间内共同拟订作插图、封面设计的计划，画得好了可以解决一部分供应问题，学生也可以把它当成业务学习的一个方面。为了提高插图者的业务水平，沟通出版者、编辑者、美术工作者的关系，他建议在每隔一定时间举行插图观摩会，欣赏作品和讨论创作。
    郁风说，不管从事那一部门工作，能画画的同志都应动员起来，采取主动的态度，多画。即如不能发表，也可作为练习。她说：“现在都是出版者、编辑者向我们拉稿，画家自己投稿的时候很少，这种情况，应该改变。”
    司徒乔、刘仑都认为作文学作品的插画工作，画家需要有很好的文学修养和具有基本的生活知识，他们希望画家能很好地进行学习，能熟悉生活。其他同志并补充了画家也应该重视利用间接经验，多多研究生活，经常阅读文学作品。
    最后，蔡若虹代表中华全国美术工作者协会表示，这个座谈会是一个良好的开始，表现了出版界和美术家是重视这一工作的。今后中华全国美术工作者协会的绘画组将首先讨论插图问题，特别是插图艺术的表现方法问题，都将继续讨论研究。
