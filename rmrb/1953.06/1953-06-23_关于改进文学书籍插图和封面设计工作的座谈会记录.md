Record of a Symposium on Improving Illustration and Cover Design of Literary Books

On May 4th, this newspaper published Comrade Wang Chaowen's article "On Illustrations in Literary Books" and a brief commentary in "Cultural Life" entitled "Improving Illustrations and Cover Design of Literary Books," which criticized the lack of illustrations or the crude and perfunctory illustrations in currently published literary works, as well as the generalized and monotonous cover designs. This has attracted the attention of the publishing and art communities. To exchange opinions on improving this aspect of work, this newspaper held a symposium on June 8th. Attendees included leaders from the People's Publishing House, People's Literature Publishing House, China Youth Publishing House, editorial departments of "People's Literature," "Liberation Army Literature," "Liberation Army Pictorial," "China Youth," "New Observer," Baowentang Bookstore, and artists Cai Ruohong, Wang Chaowen, Hua Junwu, Gu Yuan, Situ Qiao, Xin Mang, Su Jian, Chen Xinghua, Yu Feng, A Lao, and others, totaling thirty-three people. They reflected readers' demands for the current illustration and cover work of literary readings and raised opinions on the phenomenon of publishers, editors, and some leaders not valuing illustration art, as well as on cultivating professional illustration talents and organizing creative forces.

Readers Demand Improvement in Illustration and Cover Design of Literary Readings

Readers are dissatisfied with the decline of illustration art and the generalization of cover design in current literary readings. Comrades who attended the symposium reflected that many publishing houses and magazine offices often receive opinions from readers requesting excellent illustrations in literary readings and beautiful cover designs that match the content and nature of the books and periodicals.

Some of the books published by the People's Literature Publishing House have begun to include illustrations, but some of the illustrations are not very well drawn, and they plan to organize painters to take on this work. The "artistic fonts" used on the covers of their books have a common problem of being generalized and failing to express the excellent traditions of Chinese calligraphy. In the past, "People's Literature" used to publish one or two pages of paintings or woodcuts in each issue, which readers loved and hoped would be published regularly in the future. In the past, the magazine had illustrations for literary works, but not frequently enough or of sufficient quality; its cover patterns and layout were somewhat rigid, old-fashioned, and not lively; the table of contents at the beginning of each issue was routinely marked with two thick black lines above and below, which readers found unsatisfactory.

Liu Lun from the "Liberation Army Literature" said that they had conducted a survey on whether readers liked illustrations, and the result was that the vast majority of readers requested the magazine to greatly increase the number of illustrations. Lu Enyi, an artist from the Cultural Department of the Political Department of the People's Liberation Army Navy, said that the Naval Political Department attached importance to this work, and that soldiers liked illustrations very much. After the "Naval Soldiers' Newspaper" was distributed to the soldiers, many soldiers first looked at the articles with illustrations, and read the articles without illustrations later. The soldiers often wrote letters pointing out which illustrations were well-drawn and which were not, and they were extremely concerned about paintings and illustrations.

The People's Publishing House publishes books on politics, economics, and other topics. In the past, they had emphasized using some patterns with national forms to decorate the covers, and their understanding of how cover design should match the content of the book was not clear enough. They also often drew frames or five-pointed stars on the covers, which appeared rigid and monotonous, and readers were naturally even more dissatisfied. The comrades of the publishing house themselves were also dissatisfied, calling it a "lifesaving star" and "lifesaving frame." They are currently learning from the advanced experience of Soviet book design, improving their business, and preparing to improve the problem of generalized book covers.

In the past, "China Youth's" covers mostly used photos and patterns, which were not lively and lacked features. Zhao Juxian of the publishing house said: "The criticism in the newspaper has made us more aware of the importance of doing a good job in the cover design of periodicals. In the past, when we selected photos for the cover, we did not match the content of the publication, and we had the same problem when we used patterns later. In the future, on the one hand, we will ask artists to design the cover for us, and on the other hand, we will try to find photos that are suitable for the content of the publication."

At the same time, everyone talked about the issue of each publishing house and periodical having its own publishing style and editing style; this should be required not only from the content of the readings but also from the cover design and layout. Lou Shiyi of the People's Literature Publishing House, LÃ¼ Jian of "People's Literature" magazine, Zhang Qiya of the People's Publishing House, and artist Gu Yuan, who attended the meeting, all talked about the issue of the style of publications. They believe that many publishing houses and periodicals have not yet formed their own unique style. Lou Shiyi said: "What kind of style should the People's Literature Publishing House form? The general direction has not yet been determined. Readers' requirements for cover design and illustrations are various; some like bright reds and greens, while others like simple and elegant styles. We ourselves hope to form a simple and elegant style." He believes that the covers of books should also be differentiated according to different literary styles such as poetry, novels, and drama. Gu Yuan believes that whether the cover of a book or periodical should be simple or fancy depends on the target audience. For example, "People's Literature" is different from general popular readings, and its target audience is mainly literary workers, so the cover design does not have to be bright red and green, and it is better to be more simple.

Overcoming the Phenomenon of Not Valuing Illustration Art

How to improve the backward situation of illustration art in literary readings is an urgent problem to be solved, and the solution of this problem requires the close cooperation of publishers, editors, and artists. Everyone should strive to meet the broad readership's demand for illustration art. Currently, most publishers and editors do not pay enough attention to this work. Many comrades at the meeting reflected that the status of illustrations in publications is often squeezed by the printing type. Some illustrations are shrunk very small and printed unclearly, some do not even print the names of the illustrators, some cut off a part of a painting to accommodate the "specifications" of the publication, and some even dig out the background of pencil drawings for the convenience of plate making. Some painters have created illustrations for literary works, which were published in the first edition but were canceled without reason in the reprinting. For example, the illustrations that Gu Yuan made for Zhou Libo's novel "Hurricane" were in this situation. The illustrations that Cai Ruohong made for other literary readings were also used intermittently. There are many such situations. This phenomenon of not valuing the labor of painters hinders the creative enthusiasm and the improvement of creative quality of painters, and affects the development of illustration art. It should be quickly corrected. Illustration art should be given its due status in literary readings.

The common difficulty felt by the painters who attended the meeting was that there was too little creation time. Currently, we do not have professional illustrators. Those who draw illustrations generally serve in certain agencies and groups, and the work tasks of their positions are heavy. Drawing illustrations for publications requires squeezing spare time, so some painters feel it is a burden. In addition, some leaders of units have departmentalism and have a narrow view of the work tasks of cadres. They do not fully understand the social significance of illustration art and create a bad atmosphere around the painters, making the painters feel that the paintings they make for non-unit work are "illegitimate children." Everyone agreed that the responsible comrades of this unit should be urged to change this incorrect thinking. Painting for publications is the social responsibility of painters. In addition to completing the work tasks of their positions, the leadership should not only not stop them but also have the responsibility to encourage and assist painters to paint for publications. When necessary, this part of the painter's work should also be included in the painter's overall work plan.

There are also some shortcomings in our current publishing and editing work, which have caused difficulties for painters in their creative work. For example, some publishers and magazine editors usually do not know enough about what certain painters are good at and what they are willing to paint. They often simply ask for manuscripts and urge for manuscripts, and the time for soliciting manuscripts is very short, leaving painters with little time to think fully. The "New Observer" magazine often has this situation. Some painters have to rush overnight to complete the paintings in order to submit the manuscripts on time, which is very harmful to the improvement of the quality of the paintings. As A Lao said: "The time for soliciting manuscripts is very tight, and it is not easy to draw the image correctly, let alone artistic integrity." The painters also expressed that to draw good illustrations, they must have certain life experiences, especially to carefully study literary works. Li Zongjin said that after reading the Soviet novel "A Real Man," some images and scenes were aroused in his mind, which were based on his own life experiences, but after seeing the illustrations of "A Real Man" drawn by the Soviet Zhukov, he felt that there was a big difference from his initial imagination. He said: "If you don't carefully study literary works before making illustrations, it is difficult to draw well, and sometimes it may even distort the images in the works." Cai Ruohong said: "If you don't give painters sufficient time, it seems that you value painters on the surface, thinking that painters can do it at once, but in fact, you don't value them, treating painters as craftsmen, which seriously violates the laws of creation."

Regarding how to improve this situation, many people expressed their opinions. Xi Ye said: "Editors should fully grasp the characteristics of painters to solicit manuscripts." Situ Qiao said: "In the future, when the organization of the All-China Artists Association is sound, it should do more work in this area, learn more about the specialties of painters and their creative interests in a certain area, and introduce and recommend them to publishers and editors to make the creation of illustration art flourish." Hua Junwu believes that publishing houses and magazines should strengthen organizational work, understand the characteristics of painters, and have their own work plans, solicit manuscripts from painters earlier, and give painters a relatively sufficient creative time.

Cultivating Illustration Talents and Organizing Creative Forces

The lack of good illustrations in current literary readings is closely related to the lack of illustration talents and the failure to organize creative forces well. Situ Qiao, Gu Yuan, and others believe that it is necessary to cultivate professional illustration talents. Lou Shiyi said that they want to spend two or three years selecting one or two books by Lu Xun to make exquisite illustrations, but the current difficulty is that they cannot find suitable people to draw. Gu Yuan believes that publishing houses should be determined to spend several years making good illustrations for Chinese classical works and good novels and publishing exquisite versions. It is necessary to specialize illustrators, train them to be familiar with life, and improve their painting ability. Situ Qiao said that the cultivation of illustration painters should not only start from the existing illustration talents but also hope that the Central Academy of Fine Arts will train more talents in this area, and the teaching plan should include illustration courses. Xi Ye said that Soviet illustrators have won Stalin Prizes, and we should also greatly promote illustration art and change the current situation of illustration "lacking literary flavor." We should make more efforts in this regard. Wang Chaowen believes that drawing illustrations is a good way for painters to improve their professional level. Departmentalism on the part of the leadership of certain units is certainly a problem, but it is also important for painters to actively strive to draw more illustrations. Many truly accomplished painters have drawn illustrations. Drawing more illustrations can at least indirectly enrich the painter's life experience and improve creative skills. The life in literary works is not a natural form of life, but a more concentrated and generalized artistic depiction. Drawing more illustrations will help us learn how to reflect life and will not hinder the development of special artistic techniques. He believes that the leadership should also focus on illustration when training art cadres. Publishing houses and magazines should strengthen contact with painters and organize forces. It is also possible to jointly formulate plans for making illustrations and cover designs with students from the Central Academy of Fine Arts within a certain period of time. If the paintings are well done, they can solve part of the supply problem, and students can also regard it as an aspect of business learning. In order to improve the professional level of illustrators and communicate the relationship between publishers, editors, and artists, he suggested holding illustration viewing sessions at regular intervals to appreciate works and discuss creation.

Yu Feng said that regardless of which department they work in, comrades who can draw should be mobilized to take an active attitude and draw more. Even if they cannot be published, they can be used as practice. She said: "Now publishers and editors are asking us for manuscripts, and there are very few times when painters submit their own manuscripts. This situation should be changed."

Situ Qiao and Liu Lun both believe that for the work of illustrating literary works, painters need to have good literary cultivation and basic life knowledge. They hope that painters can study well and be familiar with life. Other comrades also added that painters should also attach importance to using indirect experience, study life more, and read literary works regularly.

Finally, Cai Ruohong, on behalf of the All-China Artists Association, said that this symposium was a good start, showing that the publishing community and artists attach importance to this work. In the future, the painting group of the All-China Artists Association will first discuss the issue of illustrations, especially the issue of the expression methods of illustration art, and will continue to discuss and study.
