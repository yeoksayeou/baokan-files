    Xinhua News Agency, Panmunjom, 8th. Our special correspondent Wu Min reports: The two sides have reached a complete and final agreement on the issue of repatriating prisoners of war during the administrative meeting, which has been the only obstacle hindering the armistice for more than a year. The two sides signed the "Terms of Reference for the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission" agreement at 2:00 PM today, and the signing of the armistice agreement is now on the agenda.
    The proceedings of the plenary session and the staff officers' meetings remain strictly confidential, but both sides have agreed that the contents of the "Terms of Reference for the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission" agreement will be released immediately after it is signed.
    The main points of the "Terms of Reference for the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission" are:
    (1) After the armistice, all prisoners of war who insist on repatriation will be directly repatriated. All prisoners of war not directly repatriated will be taken care of by the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, which is composed of representatives from Poland, Czechoslovakia, Sweden, Switzerland, and India.
    (2) Only India will provide the necessary fully armed troops and other personnel to assist the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission. The Indian representative will serve as the umpire and as the chairman and executor of the commission. The commission will make decisions by majority vote.
    (3) Indian armed forces will take full control of the prisoner-of-war camps after the military forces of the detaining side withdraw. The detaining side guarantees the security and order of the areas near these prisoner-of-war camps.
    (4) The Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission will immediately arrange specific matters so that representatives of the prisoners of war's home countries have the freedom and convenience to explain to the prisoners of war that they have the right to return to their homes and have full freedom to return home and live a peaceful life.
    (5) The number of representatives conducting explanatory work shall not exceed seven per thousand prisoners of war; the time limit for explanatory work is set at ninety days.
    (6) After this time limit, the issue of prisoners of war who have not exercised their right to be repatriated will be submitted to a higher-level political conference. If the disposal issue cannot be resolved within thirty days, the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission will convert the prisoners of war to civilian status. After this, prisoners of war who choose to go to neutral countries should be assisted by the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and the Indian Red Cross. This work should also be completed within thirty days. After these thirty days, the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission will be dissolved. After this period, those willing to return to their home country should be assisted by the local authorities to return.
    Although the proceedings of the secret meetings remain confidential, studying the "Terms of Reference for the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission" makes it clear that the path to a swift armistice has been cleared thanks to major efforts on the part of the Korean and Chinese sides. The resumption of armistice negotiations was made possible by the Korean and Chinese side's proposal to resolve the prisoner-of-war issue in two steps: immediately repatriating all prisoners of war who request repatriation and handing over the remaining prisoners of war to neutral countries for care, pending a fair resolution of their repatriation issue. The whole world has expressed support for General Nam Il's eight-point proposal, considering it the foundation for reaching a swift agreement to facilitate an armistice. The agreement signed today confirms that General Nam Il's eight-point proposal has long laid the foundation for a complete agreement in the secret meetings.
    Despite the leaks of the proceedings of the meetings by the Syngman Rhee personnel in Munsan and Seoul and by the US personnel in Tokyo and Washington, an agreement was quickly reached in the secret meetings. It is worth pointing out that, as in the past, the Korean and Chinese side demonstrated sincerity in strictly adhering to the agreement to keep the proceedings of the secret meetings confidential. It is clear that the leakers of the proceedings of the meetings are the anti-armistice elements in the United States and South Korea, with the aim of preventing the imminent realization of the armistice. They echoed the slogan of "going it alone." But the forces demanding a swift armistice worldwide are growing stronger and stronger, and they are just small eddies in the torrent of the world's struggle for peace.

### 我方重大的努力扫清了停战道路

    我方重大的努力扫清了停战道路
    【新华社板门店八日电】本社特派记者吴敏报道：双方在行政性会议上已对遣返战俘的问题达成了完全的、最后的协议，这个问题是一年多以来阻碍停战的唯一障碍。双方已在今天下午二时签订了“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”协议，停战协定的签订现在已提到日程上来了。
    全体会议和参谋人员会议的进行情况仍然是严守秘密的，但是双方同意，“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”协议签字后，这个协议的内容立即予以公布。
    “中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”的要点是：
    （一）在停战后，所有坚持遣返的战俘将直接遣返，未被直接遣返的一切战俘，由波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、瑞典、瑞士和印度的代表们组成的中立国遣返委员会予以看管。
    （二）只由印度提供为了协助中立国遣返委员会而需要的充分武装部队和其他工作人员，印度代表将任公断人，并任委员会的主席和执行人。委员会将根据多数票来作出决定。
    （三）印度武装部队在拘留一方的军事部队撤退后完全接管战俘看管地点。拘留一方保证这些战俘看管地点的附近地区的治安和秩序。
    （四）中立国遣返委员会立即安排具体事宜，使战俘所属国家的代表得到自由和便利，来向战俘解释他们有权返回自己的家乡，并有充分自由回家过和平生活。
    （五）进行解释工作的代表人数每千名战俘不超过七名；进行解释工作的限期定为九十天。
    （六）在这一限期过后，尚未行使被遣返权利的战俘的问题将提交高一级的政治会议。如果在三十天之内不能解决处置问题，中立国遣返委员会将把战俘改为平民身份。此后，选择前往中立国的战俘应由中立国遣返委员会和印度红十字会协助前往。这一工作也应在三十天内完成。在这三十天后，中立国遣返委员会即予解散。在这一时期以后，愿意返回祖国者应由所在地当局协助返回。
    虽然秘密会议的进行情况仍守秘密，但是研究一下“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”，就可以清楚地看出，由于朝中方面的重大努力，迅速停战的道路已经扫清了。恢复停战谈判之所以可能，是由于朝中方面建议分两个步骤来解决战俘问题，立刻遣返所有要求遣返的战俘，把其余战俘交给中立国看管以待公正解决他们的遣返问题。全世界都表示支持南日大将的八条方案，认为这是迅速达成协议以促成停战的基础。今天签字的协议证实了南日大将的八条方案早已奠定了秘密会议中完全协议的基础。
    尽管在汶山和汉城的李承晚方面人员以及在东京和华盛顿的美方人员泄露了会议的进行情况，但在秘密会议中还是很快达成了协议。值得指出的是，像在过去一样，朝中方面在严格遵守对秘密会议进行情况保守秘密的协议方面，表现了诚意。泄露会议进行情况的显然是美国和南朝鲜的反停战分子，目的是阻止即将到来的停战的实现。他们随声附和了“单独干”的口号。但全世界要求迅速停战的力量越来越强大，他们只是世界争取和平的激流中的小旋涡罢了。
