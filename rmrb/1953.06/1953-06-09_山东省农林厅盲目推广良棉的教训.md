    The Lesson of the Shandong Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry's Blind Promotion of Improved Cotton Varieties
    Tan Tian, Cheng Hao
    Editor's Note: The Shandong Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry's mistakes in promoting improved cotton varieties stem primarily from treating the peasantry as they would state-owned farms and national breeding institutions, using peasant land for seed breeding, forcing peasants to adopt foreign varieties that had not been proven effective in the local area, and forcing peasants to use methods of maintaining seed purity employed by scientific research institutions. This approach and these methods are wrong. The Shandong Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry's errors are closely related to the erroneous instructions of the Central Ministry of Agriculture and the former East China Department of Agriculture and Forestry. The Central Ministry of Agriculture's proposal for universal adoption of improved varieties nationwide within three to five years was erroneous; the documents issued by the former East China Department of Agriculture and Forestry repeatedly put forward erroneous policies and methods, demanding that lower levels resolutely implement them. We hope everyone will learn from this lesson and avoid similar mistakes.
    (I)
    Since the Shandong Dazhong Daily published the "Cangshan Cotton Uprooting Incident" on January 20th of this year, working cadres and peasants in many parts of Shandong Province have continuously written to the Shandong Dazhong Daily, exposing similar incidents of forced cotton uprooting and destruction that had occurred in their areas over the past few years. According to preliminary understanding, from 1950 to 1952, in the three years, excluding the three special districts in western Shandong that originally belonged to Pingyuan Province, similar incidents occurred in nine of the original eleven special districts. Incomplete statistics from ten counties in the five special districts of Linyi, Yishui, Jiaozhou, Tai'an, and Tengxian in 1952 alone show that more than 2,000 mu of cotton were forcibly uprooted or destroyed. According to reader Liu Xiangzhi's letter, Pingyi County forcibly uprooted nearly 1,000 mu of cotton in 1952 in two instances. The first time was in May, when the cotton seedlings were small and could be replanted with other crops; the second time was in July, when the cotton had already flowered and produced bolls, making it impossible to replant with other crops. As a result, the masses were extremely angry, scolding the cadres in charge of uprooting cotton as "sabotaging production"; the cadres of the county farm threatened the peasants, saying that "failure to uproot small cotton would be treated as growing opium." After Fei County peasant Yin Yucang, an elderly man, had six fen of cotton uprooted, he was so angry that he refused to eat, saying:
    "I will never forget the cadres uprooting cotton, even if I live another sixty years, and I will tell my children not to forget this when I die." In 1952, Panjiazhuang Township in Changqing County uprooted more than 180 mu of cotton. Seventy-year-old peasant Pan Maotang, who had spent a lot of effort carrying water to sow three mu and seven fen of cotton, was so angry when it was uprooted that he jumped off a cliff to commit suicide (but was rescued and did not die). Incidents of forcing peasants to destroy intercrops in cotton fields, destroying grain crops to plant cotton, and replanting already sown cotton fields have also occurred frequently in recent years. In 1950, Qidong County forcibly overturned and replanted all 13,000 mu of medium cotton fields with improved cotton varieties. Township cadres in Kuangjiazhuang and Dongliukouzi townships in the fourth district of Gaomi County organized "armed grain destruction teams" to forcibly destroy grain seedlings and replant them with improved cotton.
    From these extremely incomplete materials, it can be seen that in the past three years of Shandong Province's promotion of improved cotton varieties, serious errors similar to the "Cangshan Cotton Uprooting Incident" have occurred in many areas, causing incalculable disastrous consequences - not only causing significant economic losses to the state and the masses, but more seriously, causing extremely adverse effects politically, undermining the peasants' enthusiasm for production, and severing the ties between the Party, the People's Government, and the people.
    (II)
    Why could such incidents occur continuously throughout the province? In addition to the fact that the cadres directly involved lacked a mass perspective and had a commandist style of thinking and working, the Shandong Provincial People's Government's Department of Agriculture and Forestry, which was directly responsible for leading the province's cotton planting work, bears serious responsibility. The Department of Agriculture and Forestry has had a series of erroneous ideological viewpoints in its work of promoting improved cotton varieties over the past few years; under the guidance of these erroneous ideological viewpoints, it issued erroneous documents and instructions, and stipulated erroneous measures and methods. This is the main reason why cotton uprooting incidents inevitably occurred throughout the province.
    A serious task-oriented view, subjectively determining tasks. This is the first mistake of the Department of Agriculture and Forestry in promoting improved cotton varieties. In the spring of 1950, two million jin of "Si Zi Wu Ai" and "Si Zi Er Bi" cotton seeds were shipped to Shandong from abroad. The Provincial People's Government's Department of Industry (the predecessor of the Department of Agriculture and Forestry) formulated a "Preliminary Plan for the Propagation and Promotion of Improved Cotton Varieties," proposing to "complete the task of variety replacement throughout the province within three years." That is, by 1952, the millions of mu of cotton fields throughout the province had to be replaced with "Si Zi Wu Ai" or "Si Zi Er Bi" cotton, and all existing local varieties had to be completely eliminated. What was the basis for determining this task? The plan stated: "It is estimated that the yield per mu of seed cotton this year (note: referring to the yield per mu after all two million jin of "Si Zi Wu Ai" and "Si Zi Er Bi" cotton seeds shipped in 1950 are planted) is 120 jin, and the minimum yield of improved varieties per mu is 50 jin. At a reproduction rate of six times, at least 1.7 million mu can be planted in 1951; the cotton seeds produced in the same year are calculated at a reproduction rate of four times, so by 1952, 6.8 million mu can be promoted. This exceeds the province's need for 6 million mu of cotton fields in 1952." This is the entire basis for proposing this task. As for whether these cotton seeds from abroad are suitable for the natural environment of various parts of Shandong? Before typical demonstrations, can peasants abandon their familiar varieties of many years and accept and plant unfamiliar varieties from abroad? Can the strength of the province's agricultural technical guidance cadres and the existing cultivation conditions of peasants be competent for such a huge task in a short period of time? The task is executed by more than 30 million (the province's population was about 40 million at the time) scattered individual peasants. Can a single order make them give up their farming habits of thousands of years in unison? These major issues were not taken as the basis for proposing the task. In this way, the Department of Agriculture and Forestry violated the extremely important principle of "starting from reality," and therefore could not but run into walls in the face of reality. What is the fact? According to statistics from the Department of Agriculture and Forestry: In 1951, only 1.29 million mu of improved varieties were planted, with a seed yield of only 33 jin per mu. Regardless of how many of these figures were obtained by commandism or exaggeration, and regardless of the fact that the low ability of cadres to identify cotton seeds and the lack of flower picking and ginning equipment have mixed in a lot of miscellaneous cotton, it is already enough to prove that the original plan was subjective. However, the Department of Agriculture and Forestry did not accept this lesson and make a comprehensive study of this issue, which affects the vital interests of the broad masses of peasants. Instead, it hastily put forward a "three-year completion" plan for promoting improved varieties starting in 1951, and continued to advance blindly, to the point of developing into a very serious situation. For example, in 1951, the Department of Agriculture and Forestry concentrated on promoting improved varieties in Cangshan County, where most peasants have no cotton growing habits and are non-commercial cotton producing areas, and established improved variety management areas, and established a "core area for improved varieties" in Songjiazhuang in the county to carry out the propagation and promotion of improved varieties. Originally, Cangshan County had very little cotton fields, and they were very scattered. The peasants grew cotton only for their own use. In 1950, they planted a little more, with a total of more than 34,000 mu in the county, including more than 23,000 mu of degenerated foreign cotton and more than 11,000 mu of medium cotton (the so-called local cotton or small cotton). The characteristics of these cottons planted locally are short lint, suitable for hand spinning and for use as cotton wool for quilts, mattresses, and cotton clothes, and at the same time, they are highly resistant to pests. This is in line with the needs and cultivation conditions of local peasants at that time. However, the Department of Agriculture and Forestry completely ignored this practical situation and rashly carried out a "three-year completion of variety replacement" work in this area, which cannot but be said to be one of the important reasons for the "Cangshan Cotton Uprooting Incident." Although the former Cangshan County Mayor Zhang Zuochen forced the uprooting of cotton, the peasants of Cangshan still did not "complete" the "task" assigned to them by the Department of Agriculture and Forestry. In 1951, the county planted 4,000 mu of improved cotton, but medium cotton was still over 10,000 mu, and degenerated foreign cotton increased to more than 24,000 mu; in 1952, improved varieties increased to more than 13,000 mu, but medium cotton suddenly increased to more than 19,000 mu, and degenerated foreign cotton still had more than 9,000 mu. That is to say, even with the use of many coercive measures to promote improved varieties, in two years, improved varieties only accounted for 30% of the cotton fields. In the province as a whole, by 1952, including coercive measures and exaggerated figures, improved varieties only accounted for 40% of the cotton fields. This even more clearly proves that the Department of Agriculture and Forestry's second "three-year completion of variety replacement task" plan is still a product of subjectivism.
    In commercial cotton producing areas with large and concentrated cotton fields, such as Dezhou and Huimin, planting long-staple improved cotton is indeed more beneficial to peasants than planting other types of cotton, and it also meets the needs of the country; however, it is not feasible to force the widespread planting of improved cotton before peasants have generally recognized that it is indeed beneficial. As for non-commercial cotton producing areas with small and scattered cotton fields, such as Linyi, Tai'an, and Wendeng, local cotton varieties suitable for peasants' daily use should be appropriately selected; it is even more unreasonable to force peasants to universally replace improved cotton in these areas.
    All this shows how serious the subjectivism of the leadership of the Department of Agriculture and Forestry is, and it can also be seen that the incidents of forced cotton uprooting that have occurred in recent years are precisely derived from the "work tasks" determined by this subjectivism.
    (III)
    The second mistake of the Department of Agriculture and Forestry is the bourgeois anti-scientific viewpoint in the work of maintaining the purity of improved cotton varieties:
    (1) Since 1950, the Department of Agriculture and Forestry has regarded "Si Zi Wu Ai" and "Si Zi Er Bi" cotton as "favorites," while treating all other varieties as "hybrids" or "inferior varieties." Within the improved variety management area and promotion area, "the planting of hybrid varieties is strictly prohibited." For example, the "Implementation Measures for Increasing Cotton Production in Shandong Province" formulated by the Department of Agriculture and Forestry in 1950 stated: "Improved cotton should be promoted in a concentrated manner, and each area should preferably be more than 5,000 mu. The planting of other cotton varieties is prohibited in the area... When peasants sow, guidance personnel should check whether all the cotton seeds they have received are planted. Before sowing, they should publicize the benefits of maintaining pure varieties and the disadvantages of cotton seed mixing, so that they understand that other cotton seeds cannot be mixed in improved cotton fields, otherwise it will be difficult to clean up once mixed." With such strict regulations at the beginning of promotion, it can be imagined that after the "three-year completion of variety replacement," all the original cotton seeds in the province would have no room for survival. The guiding ideology for making this plan is that "Si Zi Wu Ai" cotton and "Si Zi Er Bi" cotton are superior to all the original cotton in Shandong, and will remain "superior" for generations to come; the original "miscellaneous and inferior cotton" will also remain "miscellaneous and inferior" forever. This is precisely the anti-scientific viewpoint of Morgan's bourgeois "scholars" on the "immutable law of heredity." It denies the inevitability of the development of things, denies the various changes that organisms can undergo due to the external environment, and violates the scientific principles of the great biologist Michurin. When Michurin spoke about the "basic principles of producing new varieties," he said: "The only correct way to solve the problem is to cultivate local new varieties in each region from seeds." Therefore, he warned people: "If you want to use my methods and achievements, it is best to look less for Michurin's existing varieties... Whoever wants to use my achievements should study my working methods and create the varieties they need locally on the basis of these methods." When he criticized the "immutable law of heredity," he said: "Scholars try to prove that the method of changing the external environment cannot change heredity in a certain direction. In their view, the entire history of organisms on earth is a stagnant, unchanging characteristic, a mechanical combination of unchanging characteristics." Introducing foreign varieties is naturally also a method that should be adopted to improve local varieties; but it must not be just blind faith in foreign varieties. Maintaining the purity of improved varieties is also an important item in Michurin's working methods, but it is not based on the erroneous theoretical basis of "immutable genetic quality"; foreign varieties will still change in the new environment. When introducing foreign varieties, they must first be tested in different regions under different conditions to prove that they are indeed usable locally, or cultivated into new improved varieties suitable for the local area, and then promoted to the peasant masses by demonstration. Agricultural scientific research institutions and improved variety propagation and breeding institutions naturally also avoid variety mixing when breeding improved varieties, and also "remove miscellaneous and inferior varieties" in a certain propagation area. But in any case, it cannot be considered that foreign improved varieties are sacred, inviolable, and can forever maintain their excellent quality as long as they are separated from other varieties. "Removing miscellaneous and inferior varieties" is one of the methods to maintain the quality of improved varieties, but first, there must be a correct concept of what is a good variety. The so-called "improved variety purity maintenance" work carried out by the Department of Agriculture and Forestry has nothing in common with Michurin's method of maintaining the purity of improved varieties. They do not understand that any variety is always changing, either for the better or for the worse. Therefore, unconditionally isolating foreign improved varieties from local varieties or unconditionally excluding local varieties is wrong.
    (2) On the issue of whether to increase production, too much emphasis is placed on the role of improved varieties, and the role of natural conditions and cultivation conditions is not emphasized at the same time, which forms an erroneous view of "improved varieties are all-powerful." This view is closely related to the above erroneous view. Therefore, since "Si Zi Wu Ai" and "Si Zi Er Bi" cotton entered Shandong Province, the slogan of "maintaining the purity of improved varieties" and "using improved varieties" has overwhelmed everything in the technical guidance of cotton planting work, and doubts have also arisen as to whether artificial cotton pruning should be carried out. In the "Summer Production Plan for Cotton Improvement Work" of the Department of Agriculture and Forestry in 1950, managing the work of improved varieties was emphasized as "the focus of this year's cotton production increase work." This view of "improved varieties are all-powerful" cannot stand theoretically, and has also been overturned by peasants' practice. For example, why is the yield per mu of cotton grown by Gaomi cotton farmer Liu Honggang higher than the general yield in the local area, and he can make a cotton boll have seven or eight petals, while other cotton farmers cannot, and some even have as few as two or three petals? Is this due to the seeds? Obviously, the Department of Agriculture and Forestry has not seriously considered these issues. With this view, it will inevitably limit the play of people's active cultivation power, and it will inevitably ignore the summary and promotion of the cultivation experience of the peasant masses.
    (3) Lack of serious research and cautious scientific attitude. It has been three years since the promotion of improved varieties, and it is inevitable that the characteristics of these improved varieties will change more or less due to the different soil, climate, rainfall, and cultivation conditions in various parts of Shandong, but the Department of Agriculture and Forestry has not conducted any investigation or research. In this way, there is no basis for specific technical guidance under different conditions in various parts of Shandong. When they publicize cultivation methods, they are always "general" things like "deep plowing, multiple harrowing, multiple hoeing, and multiple fertilization." They do not understand that under certain conditions, deep plowing and multiple harrowing will destroy the soil's structural structure and reduce its fertility. In the coastal area of Rizhao County, improved varieties were planted in the past few years, but they suffered poor harvests due to the influence of sea winds. However, the Department of Agriculture and Forestry did not pay attention to studying this situation. In the winter of 1952, it still allocated enough improved varieties to plant 10,000 mu of cotton fields there; later, because local peasants refused to use them, and the "Cangshan Cotton Uprooting Incident" occurred, it was not forcibly promoted. What is even more erroneous is that in the "Methods for Selecting and Maintaining Pure Cotton Varieties" issued at the Shandong Provincial Cotton Production Conference in August 1950, even ordinary scientific common sense was denied. When the "Methods" mentioned the method of "removing miscellaneous and inferior varieties," it said: "As for other traits (of miscellaneous cotton), they are not easy to identify in the seedling stage, and should be removed when removing inferior varieties; removing inferior varieties too early will make it impossible to see the morphology of various parts of the cotton plant, and removing inferior varieties too late will be afraid of cross-pollination, so it should be carried out when two or three peaches have formed." Everyone knows that cotton can produce peaches because the pollen of the stamen is crossed with the pistil. Before the cotton produces peaches, the pollen has already spread everywhere. Since two or three peaches have already formed, what is the point of preventing "cross-pollination"? In addition to destroying the cotton that peasants are about to harvest, what else can such "technical guidance" do?
    The series of anti-scientific viewpoints of the Department of Agriculture and Forestry in the guiding ideology of cotton planting technology is not only one of the reasons for the cotton uprooting incidents that occurred throughout the province, but more seriously, they have also cultivated these anti-scientific viewpoints among the cadres engaged in cotton production work throughout the province and among some peasant masses. The content of the lectures in the cotton industry training classes held in Gaomi, Linyi, and other places is permeated with this erroneous viewpoint. The impact of this erroneous viewpoint on cotton production is very bad. As Academician Miding of the Soviet Academy of Sciences said in his summary of the meeting of the All-Union Lenin Academy of Agricultural Sciences when criticizing the "immutable law of heredity": "This theory can only cause great harm to agricultural practice, because it denies the possibility of improving the quality of plants by developing high agricultural technology, and degrades the task of agricultural technology to merely ensuring the quality that already exists in plants."
    (IV)
    Since the work plan is determined by being divorced from reality and relying on subjective wishes, and there are anti-scientific viewpoints in the technical guidance ideology that are divorced from the basis of practice, it is inevitable to adopt erroneous methods of coercion and command in the work. This is the third mistake of the Department of Agriculture and Forestry in promoting improved cotton varieties. Opening the archives of the Department of Agriculture and Forestry's documents, instructions, and notices on cotton planting work over the past three years reveals that they are full of commandist tones such as "prohibit the planting of miscellaneous cotton" and "must strictly remove miscellaneous and inferior varieties." It is enough to give a few examples here: The "Si Zi Cotton Cultivation Method" states: "The removal of false and inferior varieties should be held at the end of July. Do not try to collect a few more cotton plants and refuse to remove the false and inferior plants." The "Interim Measures for Maintaining Pure Quality Improved Cotton Varieties" states: "Peasants in each cotton management area... must not interplant other miscellaneous cotton." The "Summer Production Plan for Cotton Production Improvement Work" states: "Under the condition of combining the interests of the masses, avoid excessively caring only about the interests of individual peasants, so that the purity maintenance work is damaged," and "leading cadres at all levels... actively supervise and implement." In 1950, the "Report on the Deviation of Seed Loan Cotton Farmers in Cotton Planting and the Handling of Corrections" stated: "After emergence, the Wuqiao management area inspected the cotton fields and found about 100 mu of local cotton (medium cotton), and immediately organized the Party and government and the masses to destroy it... There are still a few cotton farmers who resolutely refuse to destroy and replant improved varieties, and have been educated and criticized. If they still do not accept guidance, they will be destroyed..." It also stated: "In each cotton management area in the Bohai region, some cotton farmers... planted local cotton ahead of the Qingming Festival. The department has notified that improved varieties will be issued at no cost, and replanted in the middle of two rows of old varieties. After the local cotton has emerged, it will be destroyed, and checked and registered." It can be seen that from the sowing of cotton in April to the replanting in May, and then to the flowering and peach formation at the end of July, there are regulations that "strictly prohibit" planting or "must not" replant so-called "hybrid" and "inferior cotton," "remove" or "destroy," and also "avoid excessively caring only about the interests of individual peasants"; if they resolutely "do not accept guidance," they will be "criticized"; if "criticism" still does not listen, they will still be "destroyed." It is no wonder that the incidents of forcing peasants to replant, uproot intercrops in cotton fields, and uproot cotton that has already flowered and produced peaches have occurred continuously in various places for years.
    Why can the leading cadres of the Department of Agriculture and Forestry allow such instructions and notices to be issued? This is a manifestation of their weak policy concept and mass concept. Obviously, they did not think that peasants planted this or that cotton on their own land according to their own will. Instead of clarifying the reasons and letting the peasants voluntarily follow your wishes, you use the methods of "strictly prohibiting" and "destroying." Isn't this illegally infringing on the peasants' private property rights? They regarded this matter, which is related to the vital interests of the broad masses of peasants, only as a "technical" problem, and did not regard it as a policy issue of the Party's attitude towards peasants. Therefore, they "regarded their own agricultural production control figures as legally binding plans, and wanted peasants to act according to our plans, thereby creating extremely serious coercion and command, violations of laws and regulations, and infringement on peasants' ownership."
    (People's Daily Editorial) Taking a step back, even if this is a "technical problem," it should be "necessary to deeply understand the regionality of agriculture and the decentralization of the small-scale economy, and avoid mechanically transplanting so-called 'scientific technologies' that are not suitable for local conditions and generally promoting certain technical improvement plans that are not suitable for regional characteristics." At the same time, "advanced agricultural technical experience from other places and foreign countries must be tested first by agricultural scientific research institutions, state-owned farms, and county agricultural experiment stations, and farmers should be demonstrated to voluntarily imitate with excellent experimental results, and farmers must not be forced to experiment and promote." (Instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on Spring Plowing Production) The Shandong Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry neither understood the regionality of agriculture and the decentralization of the small-scale economy, nor mastered the correct agricultural scientific and technological theory, but started from the time of transporting improved varieties, using commandism to carry out so-called "promotion."
    (V)
    From the above situation, it can be seen that the forced cotton uprooting incidents that have occurred continuously throughout the province in the past three years are not accidental, but are closely related to the erroneous ideological style of the leading cadres of the Department of Agriculture and Forestry.
    The occurrence of these errors in the Department of Agriculture and Forestry is inseparable from the erroneous ideological style of some responsible cadres of the Department of Agriculture and Forestry. They are fond of grandeur and success, and no matter what the subjective and objective conditions are, they always want to make the "stall" as big as possible. Originally, the former East China Department of Agriculture and Forestry stipulated that the area of the improved variety promotion area should preferably be more than 5,000 mu. Once it arrived in Shandong, it was determined that the area of each promotion area should be more than 10,000 mu. In order to make the cotton planting work "powerful," they did not ask about the strength of the cadres, and set up many "cotton management areas," "cotton farms," "cotton industry guidance stations," and even "ginning rooms," all under the direct leadership of the Department of Agriculture and Forestry. Guiding the work with this kind of thinking will inevitably be blind and reckless, regardless of the effect. Secondly, there is a lack of democratic style. Since its establishment in 1951, the Party group of the Department of Agriculture and Forestry has only been responsible for leading some political movements of the agency itself, and has not seriously worked on agricultural production work related to the vast number of peasants throughout the province. In the past discussions on cotton planting work, some people have also proposed that it is necessary to proceed with caution, especially not to force peasants not to grow medium cotton for their own use. But these opinions have not been adopted. Third, there is a serious phenomenon of decentralism. Although it is also mentioned on the surface to rely on the leadership of the Party Committee in the deployment of work, in reality it is doing its own thing. For example, the determination of Cangshan as a cotton management area and a core area for improved varieties was not discussed with the local Party Committee. It was not until after the "Cangshan Cotton Uprooting Incident" occurred that the Cangshan County Committee of the Communist Party of China knew what was going on. The phenomenon of the department indiscriminately issuing instructions and documents is also very serious. Some files, even in the name of individuals, can issue documents and answer major questions. Fourth, they do not understand or study their business, and lead the work entirely by administrative position. In the past few years, the leading cadres of the Department of Agriculture and Forestry have paid little attention to summarizing the production experience of the masses, and have not seriously studied agricultural scientific knowledge. Therefore, in dealing with major issues of agricultural science and technology, they lack specific leadership and can only blindly allow some anti-scientific ideas to spread arbitrarily; they only sign and issue documents and carry out general administrative leadership by virtue of their administrative positions, and let the special product division of the department in charge of cotton planting work indiscriminately issue documents. It is inevitable that they will make mistakes in their work.
    (VI)
    The mistakes made by the Department of Agriculture and Forestry in promoting improved cotton varieties are inseparable from the leadership of the Central Ministry of Agriculture and the former East China Department of Agriculture and Forestry. Under the control of the ideology of impatience and rashness, the Central Ministry of Agriculture put forward the requirement of popularizing improved varieties in three to five years in a general way, which led to chaos in the implementation in various places; in the three years of promoting improved varieties, the Central Ministry of Agriculture has not seriously carried out any summarization of the system and effect, and has not been able to affirm the correct side and criticize the wrong side, which has also left various places at a loss as to what to do. In a notice, the Industrial Raw Materials Department of the Central Ministry of Agriculture also said: "Strictly prevent the phenomenon of intercropping other crops and mixing improved and miscellaneous cotton in cotton fields." It is said that at the National Cotton Production Work Conference in August 1950, the Central Ministry of Agriculture criticized the practice of unconditionally excluding local cotton varieties and "removing miscellaneous and inferior varieties," but there was no clear written instruction; what to do is up to those below. In the three years from 1950 to 1952, the instructions and documents issued by the former East China Department of Agriculture and Forestry on promoting improved cotton varieties also repeatedly emphasized "strictly removing miscellaneous and inferior varieties" and "prohibiting the planting of other miscellaneous cotton" and "replacing all improved cotton in three years." For example, the "Implementation Steps for the Promotion, Propagation, and Purity Maintenance of Cotton Seeds" issued by the former East China Department of Agriculture and Forestry in 1950 stipulated that "the planting of other cotton varieties is prohibited in the promotion area... in order to replace improved varieties in three years... only designated varieties can be planted in the area, and other cotton seeds must not be interplanted." For example, in August 1952, the department issued a circular praising the "thorough elimination of miscellaneous varieties" in the Judong District of Nantong and criticizing the Sanyu District for not "launching a movement" for the "elimination of miscellaneous varieties" and citing the materials of the department's inspection team as saying:
    "Five degenerated foreign cotton plants and two chicken foot cotton plants were found mixed along the roadside in the southwest village... All localities should pay attention to inspection..." This circular obviously wants all localities to emulate "launching a movement to eliminate miscellaneous varieties." It can be seen from here that these leading agencies also lack the necessary pragmatic style and scientific attitude in the work of promoting improved cotton varieties. Therefore, they caused their directly led subordinate agencies (such as the Shandong Provincial People's Government's Department of Agriculture and Forestry) to make mistakes in their actual work.

    山东省农林厅盲目推广良棉的教训
    坦天  程浩
    编者按：山东省农林厅在推广良棉工作中所犯的错误，主要是用对待国营农场和国家良种繁育机构的态度对待农民群众，利用农民的土地来进行良种繁育工作，强迫农民采用还未经试验证实在当地确实有效的外来品种，强迫农民使用科学试验机构保持良种品质的方法。这种方针和方法是错误的。山东省农林厅的这种错误，和中央农业部、前华东农林部的错误的指示也是有密切关系的。中央农业部提出的三五年全国普及良种的方针就是错误的；前华东农林部发出的文件中也一再提出错误的方针和方法，要下级坚决执行。希望大家接受这个教训，避免类似的错误。
    （一）
    自从山东大众日报于今年一月二十日公布了“苍山拔棉事件”以后，山东全省许多地方的工作干部和农民群众曾不断写信给山东大众日报，揭发了他们所在地区几年来也曾经发生过的强迫农民拔棉、铲棉的事件。据初步了解，自一九五○年至一九五二年的三年中，除原属平原省的鲁西地区的三个专区外，原有的十一个专区中即有九个专区发生了类似事件。仅一九五二年一年中，临沂、沂水、胶州、泰安、滕县等五个专区十个县不完整的统计，强迫农民拔除、铲除的棉花即达两千多亩。据读者刘向志来信说：平邑县一九五二年两次强迫农民拔除棉花将近一千亩。第一次是五月，棉苗还小，还可以转种别的庄稼；第二次是在七月，那时棉花已经开花结桃，转种别的庄稼已不可能。因而群众忿怒异常，骂主持拔棉的干部是“破坏生产”；该县农场的干部便以“种小棉不拔就以种大烟论罪”去威胁农民。费县一个老年农民尹玉苍的六分棉花被拔除后，气得不吃饭说：
    “再活六十年也忘不了干部拔棉花，临死的时候也要告诉孩子不要忘了这件事。”长清县潘家庄乡在一九五二年即拔除棉花一百八十余亩。七十岁的农民潘茂堂，费了很大的力气挑水播种的三亩七分棉花被拔掉，气得跳崖自杀（幸获救未死）。至于强迫农民铲除棉田中的间作物，铲除粮食作物改种棉花和翻种已经播种的棉田等事件，几年来也层出不穷。一九五○年，齐东县曾强迫农民把已播种的一万三千亩中棉棉田，全部翻种改为良种棉田。高密县四区匡家庄、东流口子等乡乡干部，曾组织了“武装铲谷队”强迫铲除谷苗，改种良棉。
    从这些极不完整的材料中可以看出，三年来山东省的推广良棉工作中，类似“苍山拔棉事件”的严重错误行为，在许多地区都发生过，造成的恶果是难以估量的——不仅使国家和群众在经济上遭受了重大的损失，更严重的是在政治上造成了极为恶劣的影响，打击了农民的生产积极性，割裂了党、人民政府和人民群众的联系。

    为什么能够在全省范围内不断发生这种事件呢？除了因为直接当事的干部缺乏群众观念、有命令主义的错误思想作风以外，追本求源，直接负责领导全省植棉工作的省人民政府农林厅，负有严重的责任。农林厅几年来在推广良棉工作中有一系列的错误思想观点；在这些错误思想观点指导下，发出了错误的文件和指示，规定了错误的措施和办法。这就是不可避免地在全省范围内发生拔棉事件的主要原因。
    严重的任务观点，主观主义地确定任务。这是农林厅在推广棉花良种中的第一个错误。一九五○年春，自国外运到山东“斯字五爱”和“斯字二比”棉种二百万斤。省人民政府实业厅（农林厅前身），便制定了“关于棉花良种繁殖与推广的初步方案”，提出在三年内“必须完成全省换种任务”。即到一九五二年，全省数百万亩棉田，必须换成“斯字五爱”或“斯字二比”棉，一切原有的当地品种，必须全部排除。确定这个任务的根据是什么呢？方案中提出：“估计今年籽棉单位面积产量（按：指一九五○年运进的二百万斤“斯字五爱”和“斯字二比”棉种全部种植后的单位面积产量）每亩一百二十斤，每亩最少可能产良种五十斤，按六倍繁殖，一九五一年最少可种一百七十万亩；同年所产棉种以四倍繁殖计算，至一九五二年，可推广六百八十万亩。这已超过了一九五二年全省棉田六百万亩的需要。”这就是提出这个任务的全部根据。至于这些来自国外的棉种，是否适宜于山东各地的自然环境？在没有经过典型示范之前，农民能否丢掉自己多年来所熟悉的品种而去接受并种植来自国外的自己不熟悉的品种？全省农业技术指导干部的力量和农民现有栽培条件，能否胜任这样一个时间短促的巨大任务？执行这个任务的是三千余万（当时全省约四千万人口）分散的个体农民，能否一声号令就可以使他们齐一步调地放弃千百年来的耕作习惯？这些重大问题，都没有作为提出任务的根据。这样，农林厅就违背了“从实际出发”这一条极重要的原则，因而就不能不在实际面前碰壁。事实是怎样呢？据农林厅统计：一九五一年仅种了一百二十九万亩良种，每亩产种仅为三十三斤，姑且不管这个数字中有多少是用命令主义的方法或用夸大的方法得来的，也姑且不管由于干部检定棉种能力低和收花、轧花设备不足已使其中混进了不少杂棉的情况，已经足以证明原来的计划是主观主义的。但农林厅并没有接受这个教训，把这个牵动广大农民切身利益的问题作通盘研究，竟又草率地提出自一九五一年起的“三年完成”的推广良种计划，继续冒进，以致发展到很严重的地步。例如，在一九五一年，农林厅竟在大多数农民无种棉习惯、又系非商品棉生产地区的苍山县去集中地推广良种，设立了良种管理区，并在该县宋家庄设立了“良种核心区”，进行良种繁殖与推广工作。本来苍山县棉田很少，且又很分散，农民种棉又仅仅是为了自用。一九五○年种的多一些，全县共种棉三万四千多亩，其中退化洋棉两万三千余亩，中棉（即所谓土棉或小棉）一万一千余亩。当年收的棉花自用不足，又从外地运进一万斤。当地种植的这些棉花的特点，是棉绒短，宜于手工纺织和作被、褥、棉衣等的棉絮之用，同时抗害性较强，这是和当地农民当时的需要和栽培条件相适应的。但是，农林厅却完全无视这种实际情况，冒然地在这种地区来一个
    “三年完成换种”的工作，这不能不说是酿成“苍山拔棉事件”的重要原因之一。虽有前苍山县长张作臣强迫拔棉，苍山的农民仍然没有“完成”农林厅给他们的“任务”。一九五一年，全县种了四千亩良棉，但中棉仍在一万亩以上，退化洋棉却增至两万四千余亩；一九五二年，良种增至一万三千余亩，而中棉又突增至一万九千余亩，退化洋棉仍有九千余亩。这就是说，即使是用了很多强迫命令的办法来推广良种，但二年中良种还只是占棉田的百分之三十。在全省来说，到一九五二年，包括强迫命令和夸大的数字在内，良种也只占棉田的百分之四十。这就更明显地证明了农林厅的第二个“三年完成换种任务”的方案还是主观主义的产物。
    在棉田面积大而集中的商品棉产区，如德州、惠民等地，种长绒的改良棉，对农民也确实比种别种棉有利，也适合国家的需要；但是在还未能使农民普遍认识到确实有利的时候，强迫普遍种改良棉，是不行的。至于棉田面积小而分散的非商品棉产区，如临沂、泰安、文登等地，则应适当地评选适用于农民日用的地方棉种；在这些地方强迫农民普遍改种改良棉，就更没有道理了。
    这一切说明了农林厅领导方面的主观主义是何等的严重，也可以看出，几年来所发生的强迫群众拔棉的事件，正是导源于这种主观主义所确定的“工作任务”之中。
    （三）
    农林厅的第二个错误是在棉花良种保纯工作上有资产阶级的反科学观点：
    （一）自一九五○年以来，农林厅便把“斯字五爱”和“斯字二比”棉作为“宠儿”，而把其他一切品种都作为“杂种”或“劣种”。在良种管理区和推广区内，“严禁种植杂种”。如一九五○年农林厅拟定的“山东省棉花增产实施办法”中说：“改良棉应集中推广，每区最好能在五千亩以上，在区内禁种其他棉花，……农户播种时，指导人员应抽查其所领之棉种，是否悉数种植，在播种前应宣传保持纯种之利益，及棉种混杂之弊害，使其明了改良棉田内不可混入其他棉籽，否则一经混杂即难收拾。”一九五一年农林厅的“关于棉花查苗补苗工作的通知”中说：“……绝不能在棉田内间种其他庄稼及补种其他棉花种苗，以免良种混杂。”在最初推广时即有如此严格的规定，可以想见在“三年完成换种”之后，全省一切原有棉种便无生存的余地了。作出这种打算的指导思想，就是认为“斯字五爱”棉和“斯字二比”棉比山东的原有的一切棉花都优良，而且要辈辈世世地“优良”下去；原有的“杂棉、劣棉”，也要永世不变地“杂、劣”下去。这正是摩尔根之流的资产阶级“学者”的“遗传之不变定律”的反科学观点，它否认了事物的发展的必然性，否认了生物可以因外界环境而发生的种种变化，违背了伟大生物学家米丘林的科学原理。米丘林在讲到“产生新品种的基本原理”时说：“解决问题的惟一正确方法，就是从种籽去培育每一地区的当地新品种。”所以他曾告诫人们说：“如果你想利用我的方法和成就，那就最好少去寻找米丘林的现存的品种。……谁想利用我的成就，谁就应当研究我的工作方法，并以这些方法作基础就地创造出自己所需要的品种。”他在批判“遗传之不变定律”时又说：“学究们企图证明，用变更外界环境之法是不能使遗传性向一定方向变更的。在他们看来，大地上生物的全部历史是永世不变的特征的停滞不动，是永世不变的特性的机械新凑合。”引用外来品种，自然也是改进当地品种所应当采用的一种方法；但决不能只是迷信外来品种。良种保纯，在米丘林工作方法中也是重要的一项，可是这并不是建立在“遗传质不变”的错误理论基础上的；外来品种，在新的环境中，还是会起变化的。在引用外来品种时，先要经过在不同地域不同条件下的试验，证实在当地确实可用，或培育成为适合当地的新的良种，然后再用示范的方法向农民群众推广。农业科学研究机关和良种繁殖、培育机关培育良种时，自然也要避免品种混杂，也要在一定繁殖区内“去杂去劣”。但无论如何，不能认为外来良种是圣洁的、丝毫不可侵犯的，是只要和其他品种隔离开来就能永远保持它的优良品性的。“去杂去劣”是保持良种品质的方法之一，但首先要对什么是良种有一个正确的观念。农林厅进行的所谓“良种保纯”工作，与米丘林的良种保纯方法毫无共同之处。他们不了解任何一种品种总是要变化的，或者变好，或者变坏。因此，无条件地使外来良种与当地品种隔离或无条件地排斥当地品种，是错误的。
    （二）在能否增产的问题上，过分强调良种的作用，不是同时强调自然条件和栽培条件的作用，这就形成了一种“良种万能”的错误观点。这种看法是和上面的错误观点紧密相联的。所以自从“斯字五爱”和“斯字二比”棉进入山东省境以后，农林厅在植棉工作技术指导上，“良种保纯”和“使用良种”的口号压倒了一切，对于应否进行人工修棉也发生了怀疑。在一九五○年农林厅的“棉花改进工作夏季生产计划”中，把管理良种工作强调为“本年棉花增产工作的重点。”这种“良种万能”的观点，在理论上站不住脚，在农民的实践上也被推翻了。如同样的棉花种，为什么高密棉农刘洪岗的棉花每亩产量比当地一般的产量为高，而且他可以使一个棉桃有七、八个花瓣，而别的棉农则不能，有的竟少至两、三个瓣？这难道是种籽的原因？对于这些问题，农林厅显然并没有认真考虑过。有了这种观点，必然会限制人的主动的栽培力量的发挥，也必然忽视总结和推广农民群众的栽培经验。
    （三）缺乏认真研究和慎重从事的科学态度。良种推广已经三年，由于山东各地土壤、气候、雨量的不同，栽培条件的差异，因而这些良种的性状或多或少地发生变化是不可避免的，但农林厅并没有作过调查研究。这样，在山东各地不同条件之下，如何进行具体的技术指导便失去了依据。他们在宣传栽培方法时总是到处“通用”的“深耕、多耙、多锄、多施肥”之类。他们不了解，在一定的条件之下、深耕、多耙会破坏土壤的组织结构，而使其肥力减低。日照县滨海一带，前几年曾种过良种，因受海风影响而歉收。但农林厅并不注意研究这个情况，一九五二年冬仍然拨去足够种植一万亩棉田的良种要在那里推广；后因当地农民拒绝使用，再加“苍山拔棉事件”的发生，才没有强制推广下去。尤为错误的是一九五○年八月山东省棉产会议上印发的“棉花选种保纯办法”中，竟连普通的科学常识都给否定了。“办法”中提到“去杂去劣”的方法时说：“至于其他性状（杂棉的），在苗期还不易辨认，应待在去劣时拔除；去劣太早，棉株各部形态看不出来，去劣太晚又怕串花，所以要在结成两、三个桃时再行去劣。”谁都知道，棉花能够结桃，是雄蕊之花粉与雌蕊交配而成，在棉花结桃之前，花粉早已到处传扬，既然已经结了二、三个桃，那么防止“串花”又有什么意思呢？这样的“技术指导”，除了破坏农民即将收获的棉花以外，还能有什么作用？
    农林厅在植棉技术指导思想上的一系列的反科学观点，不仅是造成全省发生的拔棉事件的原因之一，更严重的是，他们还在全省棉业生产工作干部中和一部分农民群众中，培植了这些反科学观点。像高密、临沂等地举办的棉业训练班的讲课内容，就是贯穿着这种错误观点的。这种错误观点给棉业生产上带来的影响是很坏的。正如苏联科学院院士米丁在全苏列宁农业科学院会议的总结中批判“遗传之不变定律”时所说的：“这一理论只能给农业实践造成很大的害处，因为它否认了发扬高度农业技术来改进植物品质的可能性，把农业技术的任务贬低到仅仅是保证原来已存在于植物之中的品质而已。”
    （四）
    既然工作计划是脱离实际、依靠主观愿望确定的，而在技术指导思想上，又有脱离实践基础的反科学观点，因此在工作中便不能不采用强迫命令的错误方法。这是农林厅在推广良棉工作中的错误之三。打开农林厅三年来关于植棉工作的文件、指示、通知的档案一看，便可以发现里面充满了“禁种杂棉”、“必须严格去杂去劣”等命令主义的口气。这里举几个例子就够了：在“斯字棉栽培法”中写道：“去伪去劣要在七月底举行，不要企图多收几棵棉花，不肯把伪株、劣株拔去。”在关于“优良棉种保纯暂行办法”中说：“各棉管区内……棉农不得夹种其他杂棉。”在“棉产改进工作夏季生产计划”中说：“在结合群众利益下，避免过分只顾个别农民利益，使保纯工作受到损失，”并要“各级领导干部……积极督促贯彻执行。”一九五○年在
    “关于贷种棉农在植棉上发生的偏向和纠正处理的情况报告”中说：“吴桥管理区于出苗后，检查棉田发现土棉（中棉）一百亩左右，即通过党政及群众进行铲除，……仍有几户棉农坚决不愿铲除重种良种，已进行教育批评。如再不接受指导，即行铲除……。”又称：“渤海区各棉管区，有些棉农，……提前于清明节下种当地棉，本厅曾通知无代价发良种，在旧种两行中间重种，待当地棉出齐后，即铲除，并检查登记。”这就可以看出，从四月时棉花的播种到五月的补苗，再到七月底的开花结桃，对于所谓“杂种”和“劣棉”都有“严禁”种植或“绝不能”补种，“拔去”或“铲除”的规定，并且还要“避免过分只顾个别农民利益”；如果坚决“不接受指导”，就要“批评”；“批评”还不听，仍然要“铲除”。这就无怪各地连年不断发生强迫农民翻种、拔除棉田间作物和拔除已经开花结桃的棉花了。
    农林厅的领导干部为什么能够容许下达这样的指示和通知呢？这是他们的政策观念和群众观念薄弱的表现。显然他们没有想到，农民是按照自己的意志在自己的土地上种了这样或那样的棉花，你不是讲清道理让农民自愿地遵从你的意愿，而是用“严禁”、“铲除”的办法，这难道不是非法侵犯了农民私有权吗？他们把这样一件有关广大农民切身利益的事情，只当作一个“技术”问题去看待，没有看成是党对待农民的政策问题。因此他们就“把自己的农林生产控制数字看成具有法律效力的计划，要农民按照我们的计划办事，因而产生极其严重的强迫命令，违法乱纪和侵犯农民所有制的情形。”
    （人民日报社论）退一步讲，这就算是一个“技术问题”吧，也应该是“必须深刻认识农业的地域性与小农经济的分散性，切忌机械搬用不适合当地情况的所谓‘科学技术’与一般化地推行某些不适合地区特点的技术改进计划。”同时“外地的和外国的先进的农业技术经验必须经农业科学研究机关、国营农场和县的农事试验场先行试验，以优良的试验成果示范农民自愿仿行，不得强迫农民试验推广。”（中共中央关于春耕生产的指示）山东省农林厅既不了解农业的地域性和小农经济的分散性，又没掌握正确的农业科学技术理论，而是从运来良种的时候开始，就是用命令主义的方法进行所谓“推广”的。
    （五）
    从上述情况可以看出，三年来全省不断发生的强迫农民拔棉事件不是偶然的，而是与农林厅领导干部的错误思想作风有着密切关系的。
    农林厅这些错误的发生，是与农林厅某些负责干部的错误思想作风分不开的。他们好大喜功，不管主、客观条件如何，总想把“摊子”摆的越大越好。本来前华东农林部规定良种推广区面积最好是五千亩以上，一到山东，便确定每个推广区面积为一万亩以上。为了使植棉工作“声势浩大”，他们不问干部力量如何，便设立了很多“棉管区”、“棉场”、“棉业指导所”以至于“轧花房”，并统归农林厅直接领导。以这种思想指导工作，必然是不问效果，盲目蛮干。其次是缺乏民主作风。该厅党分组自一九五一年成立以来，只是负责领导了机关本身的一些政治运动，对于关系到全省广大农民的农林生产工作，则没有认真去作。在历次讨论植棉工作时，有人也曾提出须慎重从事，特别是不能强迫农民不种自用的中棉。但这些意见都没有被采纳。第三，有严重地分散主义的现象，对于工作的布置，虽然表面上也提到要依靠党委的领导，但实际上却是自行其是。例如苍山之被确定为棉管区和良种核心区，并未与当地党委研究，直到“苍山拔棉事件”发生后，中共苍山县委才知道是怎么一回事。厅里乱发指示、文件的现象也很严重，有的以处以至以个人的名义都可以下达文件和答复重大问题。第四，是不懂也不钻研业务，全凭行政职位领导工作。几年来农林厅的领导干部很少注意总结群众的生产经验，又没有认真学习农业科学知识。因此，在处理农业科学技术的重大问题上，缺乏具体领导，只能盲目听任一些反科学思想任意泛滥；他们只是凭行政职位去签发文件和进行一般行政事务的领导，就放任了该厅主管植棉工作的特产处滥发文件。这就不可避免地要在工作中犯错误。
    （六）
    农林厅在推广良棉工作中所犯的这些错误，与中央农业部和前华东农林部的领导也是分不开的。中央农业部在急躁冒进的思想支配下，笼统地提出三、五年普及良种的要求，促使各地在执行中发生混乱现象；推广良种三年来，在制度上、效果上，中央农业部也没有认真地进行过总结，一直未能肯定正确的一面，批判错误的一面，也使各地不知如何做是好。中央农业部工业原料司在一个通知中也说：“在棉田中严格防止间作其他作物与良、杂棉混作的现象。”据说中央农业部在一九五○年八月的全国棉产工作会议上，曾经批判了无条件排斥当地棉种和“去杂、去劣”的作法，但并无明文指示；究竟怎样做，下面无所适从。自一九五○年至一九五二年的三年中，前华东农林部所发的若干关于推广良棉的指示、文件中，也都一再强调“严格去杂、去劣”和“禁种其他杂棉”及“在三年内全部换种改良棉”。如一九五○年前华东农林部所发的“棉种推广繁殖保纯实施步骤”中规定，在推广区内“禁种其他棉花，……以期在三年内换种改良种。……在区内一律种植指定品种，不得夹种其他棉种。”又如一九五二年八月该部曾发出通报，表扬南通掘东区“肃杂彻底”，批评三余区没有把“肃杂工作”
    “掀起一个运动”，并引证该部检查组的材料说：
    “在西南村沿路边即发现五株退化洋棉与二鸡脚棉混杂其中，……各地应注意检查……”。这个通报显然是要各地效法“掀起一个肃杂运动”。从这里可以看出，这些领导机关在推广良棉工作中，也缺乏应有的实事求是的作风和科学的态度。因此，就使他们直接领导的下级机关（如山东省人民政府农林厅）在实际工作中发生了错误。
