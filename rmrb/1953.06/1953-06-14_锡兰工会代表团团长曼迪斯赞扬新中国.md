Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, June 13th: Mendis, the head of the Ceylon Trade Union Delegation, who was invited to China to participate in the "May Day" International Labor Day celebrations and the Seventh All-China Congress of Trade Unions, gave a radio speech in Guangzhou on the 11th, speaking freely about his impressions of New China.

    Mendis said: During our six-week visit to New China, we have seen the great achievements made by the Chinese people in the short three and a half years since liberation.
    Mendis highly praised the enthusiastic situation of the "May Day" parade in Beijing, saying that the "May Day" parade expressed the Chinese people's ardent desire and great determination to defend world peace. He said: At the Seventh All-China Congress of Trade Unions, we saw the working class's unparalleled enthusiasm for overfulfilling the national plan and laying the foundation for making New China a strong industrial country.
    Next, he talked about New China's tremendous efforts for industrialization. He said: We have seen many machine and machine tool manufacturing factories. The purpose of producing such a large number of machines and machine tools is to start building heavy and light industries throughout the country, to increase the country's wealth and prosperity, so that the Chinese people can live a richer and happier life.
    When talking about the deep care that the working people of New China receive, Mendis said: We have seen in many cities and villages how the government is concerned about building houses for the people. The workers who used to live in huts, thatched cottages, and earthen houses before liberation now live in new-style houses with electricity, drainage facilities, air circulation, and complete equipment. We have seen tens of thousands of such houses in Shanghai, Shenyang, Nanjing, Tianjin, and many other cities. In addition, many sanatoriums and convalescent homes with modern equipment, as well as reading rooms, libraries, and theaters, have been established for the workers.
    Mendis said: During our visit, we saw that the government is extremely concerned about the welfare of children and female workers. Mendis said: In the rural areas of New China, the situation of farmers has been greatly improved after the land reform. They are increasing production with great enthusiasm and overfulfilling the plans formulated by the state. Farmers not only have enough food to eat, but also have surplus grain stored in their barns.
    Mendis said: In New China, the patriotic health campaign has produced amazing results. He then pointed out: Another remarkable fact we have seen is the religious freedom enjoyed by Buddhists, Muslims, Christians, and people with other various religious beliefs.
    Mendis concluded: In New China, the purchasing power of people from all walks of life is constantly increasing. No matter where we go, we are met by happy people in neat clothes. The Chinese people feel that they have become the masters of the country. During our six-week trip, we deeply realized that under the brilliant leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong and the Chinese Communist Party, New China will soon grow into a strong and prosperous industrial country, adding a powerful force to the invincible force for peace.

    锡兰工会代表团团长曼迪斯赞扬新中国
    【新华社广州十三日电】应邀来我国参加“五一”国际劳动节庆祝典礼和中国工会第七次全国代表大会的锡兰工会代表团团长曼迪斯，十一日在广州发表广播演说，畅谈对新中国的观感。
    曼迪斯说：在访问新中国的六个星期中，我们看到了中国人民在解放以后短短的三年半期间内所获得的各种伟大成就。
    曼迪斯盛赞北京“五一”大游行的热烈情况，他说“五一”大游行表示了中国人民保卫世界和平的热烈愿望和伟大的决心。他说：在中国工会第七次全国代表大会上，我们看到了工人阶级为超额完成国家计划、为使新中国成为一个强大的工业国而打下基础的无比热情。
    接着，他谈到新中国为工业化而进行的巨大努力。他说：我们看到了许多机器和机械工具制造厂。这样大量生产机器和机械工具的目的，是为了开始在全国建设重工业和轻工业，以增加国家的财富和繁荣，从而使中国人民能过更富裕和幸福的生活。
    曼迪斯在谈到新中国劳动人民所受到的深切关怀时说：我们在许多城市和乡村中看到了政府是如何关心于建造人民的住宅。在解放前住在小屋、茅屋和土屋中的工人们，现在住进了有电、有排水设备、空气流通、设备完善的新式住宅。我们在上海、沈阳、南京、天津和许多其他城市中看到了成千成万幢这样的住宅。此外还为工人们建立了许多具有现代化设备的休养所和疗养院，以及阅览室、图书馆和剧院。
    曼迪斯说：我们在访问期间，看到政府对于儿童福利、女工福利是极其关怀的。曼迪斯说：在新中国的农村，农民的情况在土地改革后已大大地改善了。他们正以很大的热情增加生产并超额完成国家所制定的计划。农民们不仅有足够的粮食吃，而且他们的谷仓里还积蓄着余粮。
    曼迪斯说：在新中国，爱国卫生运动已产生了令人惊叹的成绩。他接着指出：我们所看到另外一个显著的事实，是佛教徒、回教徒、基督教徒以及有其他各种宗教信仰的人所享受的宗教自由。
    曼迪斯最后说：在新中国，各阶层人民的购买力在不断提高。不管我们到甚么地方去，我们所遇到的都是服装整洁的快乐的人们。中国人民感到，他们已作了国家的主人。我们在六星期的旅行中深深认识到，在毛泽东主席和中国共产党的光辉领导下，新中国将很快成长为强大的、繁荣的工业国，为不可战胜的和平力量增加一支强大的力量。
