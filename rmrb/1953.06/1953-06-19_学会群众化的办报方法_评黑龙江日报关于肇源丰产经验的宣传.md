    Learn the Mass Line Method of Running a Newspaper
    ——A Review of the Black Dragon River Daily's Propaganda on the Zhaoyuan Abundant Harvest Experience
    Liu Jingzhi, Deputy Director of the Newspaper and Publication Department of the Northeast Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China
    Editor's Note: Newspaper reviews are an important form of Party committee leadership over newspapers. Currently, most provincial-level Party committee propaganda departments have newspaper and publication departments, one of whose main tasks is to closely monitor and study local newspapers and publications, write newspaper reviews, promptly promote the experiences of local newspaper work, point out shortcomings in newspaper work, and propose improvement measures. However, at present, not many Party committee newspaper and publication departments in various localities frequently write newspaper reviews. This urgently needs to be improved. Below is an article by Comrade Liu Jingzhi, Deputy Director of the Newspaper and Publication Department of the Northeast Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. We hope that newspaper and publication departments of Party committees in various localities will frequently write such articles and send them to us.
    
    The Black Dragon River Daily used the mass line method of work, which is the mass line method of running a newspaper, to systematically publicize and promote the Zhaoyuan (i.e., Guo Hou Banner, the same below) abundant harvest experience, overcoming the old-fashioned propaganda in agricultural production reports.
    
    The old-fashioned, formulaic, and dull nature of agricultural production reports is a relatively common problem in many newspapers. If this problem is expressed with a formula, it is: in the spring, promote early planting and quick planting; in the summer, it is more hoeing and more weeding; in the autumn, it is quick harvesting and quick threshing; and when the lake is clear and the field is empty, it is criticizing the "hibernation" thought (i.e., the idea that there is nothing to do in winter, ignoring sideline production). The cycle repeats year after year without raising questions or solving problems. Some newspaper workers, due to a lack of sensitivity to new things and a lack of the spirit of investigation and research, are still satisfied with a little simple knowledge and experience of the past and have not worked hard enough in this area, so progress is not significant. The Black Dragon River Daily has achieved certain results under the specific leadership of the Party committee because it paid attention to improving its work early on.
    
    The Black Dragon River Daily's reports on the Zhaoyuan abundant harvest experience began in mid-October last year, and it was not until mid-December that it made more prominent publicity and promotion. The difficulties encountered at the beginning were: the editors were not very familiar with the Zhaoyuan abundant harvest experience, and at the same time, time was tight, and reports needed to be started quickly. On the other hand, at that time, various localities were carrying out Party rectification and winter training for grassroots cadres, and the winter work tasks were busy, so the time for correspondents to participate in reporting activities was relatively reduced. In particular, the Zhaoyuan County Committee of the Communist Party of China had not yet made a formal systematic summary of its experience in promoting new farming methods and leading agricultural production throughout the county. It was under these circumstances that the Black Dragon River Daily began to organize reports. The Black Dragon River Daily extracted more than half of the manpower of the rural group, studied relevant instructions and documents, and then organized reporter groups to interview in Zhaoyuan twice, learning, doing, and "working on the spot". The reporter group learned from agricultural technicians, veteran farmers, and activists in promoting new farming methods through individual interviews, holding seminars, and other means, and obtained their help. After learning (including investigation and research), they improved their understanding and had a basic understanding of the content of the new farming methods and became familiar with the lives and thoughts of the masses. This made it possible to avoid the old-fashioned agricultural production reports, raise questions practically, explore vivid things from the actual lives of the masses, and organize reports in a timely manner. For example, the reporter group helped the Zhaoyuan County Committee and other agencies in the county summarize their experience in promoting new farming methods, and organized timely reports, publicized the relationship between promoting new farming methods and promoting the cooperative mutual aid movement, and specifically explained the process of ideological changes among the masses through abundant harvest stories. The increase in yield after the implementation of new farming methods was obvious, and farmers easily accepted it, but they did not fully understand the role of improving grain quality. Therefore, the newspaper explored materials from this aspect, using stories such as "Fragrant Millet Rice" to illustrate. In the process of promoting new farming methods, what the masses found more difficult to accept was thinning, saying "two ears are as good as one ear, plus one more stick." Therefore, the newspaper used typical examples of people who were convinced of the benefits of thinning in the face of facts and those who suffered losses because they did not believe in thinning, echoing each other, to illustrate the role of thinning in increasing production. The Black Dragon River Daily also guided the promotion work in other regions based on the experience of Zhaoyuan in promoting new farming methods and the problems encountered and solved. In particular, according to the situation and problems reflected by the correspondents, the newspaper sent people to An'guang and Hailun counties twice to understand the problems of promoting the Zhaoyuan abundant harvest experience. In the promotion work, according to the development of actual work, they successively criticized several incorrect ideas and practices. Initially, some people believed that "winter work is busy, the promotion of the Zhaoyuan abundant harvest experience can be slowed down," opposing the promotion of the Zhaoyuan abundant harvest experience to winter work. While criticizing this idea, the newspaper introduced the situation of Xinglong Village in Nehe County combining abundant harvest evaluation with the promotion of new farming methods, and the experience of the Longjiang County Committee of the Communist Party of China in promoting various tasks around the promotion of the Zhaoyuan abundant harvest experience. On the other hand, it criticized An'guang County for not attaching importance to the promotion of the Zhaoyuan abundant harvest experience, and cooperated with editorials to analyze and explain. After the cadres in various regions paid more attention to the promotion work, the main problems in the promotion work were formalism and generality. At this time, the newspaper studied the experience of the promotion work and the regularity of the ideological changes of the farmers from not believing in new farming methods to believing in new farming methods. Therefore, focusing on Longjiang County, it systematically introduced the experience of the promotion work. The above-mentioned reporting methods prove that the newspaper was able to closely integrate with rural work, practically raise questions in a timely manner, and break the old-fashioned reporting format, which is inseparable from going deep into the masses and conducting investigation and research.
    
    The content of the Zhaoyuan abundant harvest experience mainly includes: the new farming methods summarized by the Zhaoyuan County Committee based on the actual situation, and the mass line leadership method and working method of the Zhaoyuan County Committee in leading agricultural production. And the new farming methods are precisely the product of the mass line working methods of the Zhaoyuan County Committee in leading agricultural production. Comrade Mao Zedong said in his speech "Get Organized!": "We should go among the masses, learn from the masses, integrate their experiences, and become better and more organized principles and methods, and then tell the masses (propaganda), and call on the masses to implement them to solve the problems of the masses and make the masses liberated and happy." What Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out here is precisely the basic principle of the mass line method of running a newspaper that our newspaper workers must abide by. But this is not always well implemented by all newspapers. Even in the Black Dragon River Daily, there are places where it is not done well enough. For example, the Black Dragon River Daily's publicity on the work style and working methods of the Zhaoyuan County Committee in leading agricultural production is not profound enough and not vivid enough, and it focuses too much on the publicity of specific agricultural technologies. This is the main shortcoming. Until now, there has been no significant improvement in this regard. In the May 22 report on the Zhaoyuan County Committee's summary of spring plowing and deployment of summer hoeing, too many figures were listed; the last mention of the leadership style problem only said that "according to the spirit of 'less on the top, more on the bottom' to deeply lead production, after the meeting, cadres of various departments were organized to go deep into various districts led by responsible comrades to implement the requirements of the meeting." The phrase "less on the top, more on the bottom" cannot correctly express the meaning of the mass line. The May 14 report reported that the Zhaoyuan County Committee had further developed its existing experience in spring plowing. However, the main content is also to introduce specific agricultural technologies, such as "row planting, row thinning," "one-time seedling setting," and "good base fertilizer, one-time topdressing." Another report used the fact that a child can recite the Zhaoyuan abundant harvest experience to illustrate the "enthusiasm" and "achievements" of the masses in learning the Zhaoyuan abundant harvest experience, which is also not convincing enough.
    
    Of course, specific agricultural technologies need to be publicized, but this kind of technology publicity cannot be separated from the mass line work style and working methods. Without mastering the mass line work methods, not only is it impossible for the Zhaoyuan abundant harvest experience to appear, but it is also impossible to truly promote it. There are many reasons why formalism and generality have appeared in the publicity of promoting the Zhaoyuan abundant harvest experience in some local newspapers, but the most important reason is that they have not mastered the mass line work methods and only focus on publicity from the formal and technical aspects. In particular, due to the geographical nature of agricultural production and the dispersion of the small-scale peasant economy, the work foundation in various regions is different, and the agricultural technology in this region is often not suitable for another region, which makes it even more necessary to focus on publicizing the mass line work methods. Only in this way can it be gradually accepted by farmers in the promotion, and supplemented and revised according to local conditions. This involves the understanding of the policy of promoting the Zhaoyuan abundant harvest experience: "universal publicity, key promotion." Comrade Lin Feng made it very clear at a meeting of the Northeast Administrative Committee: "Universal publicity refers to the work style and working methods of the Zhaoyuan County Committee in leading agricultural production, which can be learned and adopted everywhere; key promotion is to study and implement advanced farming methods suitable for the local area based on the Zhaoyuan abundant harvest experience, so this is not a rigid transplant of the Zhaoyuan experience." The Party Central Committee's instructions to Party committees at all levels on spring plowing production also clearly pointed out: "We must deeply recognize the geographical nature of agriculture and the dispersion of the small-scale peasant economy, and avoid mechanically applying so-called 'science and technology' that are not suitable for local conditions and promoting certain technical improvement plans that are not suitable for regional characteristics in a general way." "We must go deep into the peasant masses, learn from the masses, find advanced technical experiences that are suitable for local conditions, whether original or newly created, and then combine them with agricultural science and technology theories, summarize and improve them, and gradually promote them." This is the basic principle that newspapers must abide by when promoting agricultural technology.
    
    To vividly publicize the mass line working methods, one needs to have a considerable ideological level; otherwise, one will either fail to discover problems or simply talk about principles abstractly. But we cannot abandon the fundamental for the incidental because of difficulties. In this regard, the Black Dragon River Daily also needs to continue to go deep into the masses and into reality with great efforts, explore materials in this regard, and remedy the shortcomings in past publicity.
    
    Despite these shortcomings, it should still be affirmed that the experience accumulated by the Black Dragon River Daily in organizing reports on the Zhaoyuan abundant harvest experience is successful and worth learning. The old-fashioned rural reports must be broken, and the most fundamental way to break the old-fashioned is to learn the mass line working methods. To do this, newspaper workers must have full enthusiasm, the determination to look downwards, the thirst for knowledge, and the spirit of putting down airs and being willing to be primary school students. It is hoped that all newspapers, especially peasant newspapers, will draw on the experience of the Black Dragon River Daily according to their specific circumstances, and work together to improve the level of rural reporting.

    学会群众化的办报方法
    ——评黑龙江日报关于肇源丰产经验的宣传
    中共中央东北局报刊处副处长  刘敬之
    编者按：报纸述评是党委领导报纸的重要形式之一。目前省以上党委宣传部大都设有报纸刊物处，它的主要工作之一就是密切注意和研究当地的报纸刊物，撰写报刊述评，及时推广当地报刊工作的经验并指出报刊工作中的缺点，提出改进的办法。但目前各地党委的报刊处经常撰写报刊述评的还不多。这是亟应努力加以改善的。下面发表的是中共中央东北局报刊处副处长刘敬之同志的一篇文章，希望各地党委报刊处都能经常写这样的文章寄给我们。
    黑龙江日报运用群众路线的工作方法，就是群众化的办报方法，比较系统地宣传和推广了肇源（即郭后旗，下同）丰产经验，克服了农业生产报道上的老一套宣传。
    农业生产报道上老一套、公式化和枯燥乏味，是不少报纸较为普遍存在的一种毛病。这种毛病如果用一个公式来表述，那就是：春天宣传早种快种，夏天是多铲多?，秋天是快收快打，到了湖净场光时，又是批判“猫冬”思想（即认为冬季没什么活可干，忽视副业生产的思想）。如是循环往复，年复一年，不提出问题，不解决问题。对于这种老一套的宣传，有些报纸工作者因为缺乏对新鲜事物的感觉，缺乏调查研究的精神，仍满足于过去的一点简单知识和经验，没有很好地在这一方面下工夫，所以进步还不够显著；黑龙江日报由于及早注意改进自己的工作，已在党委的具体领导下取得一定的成绩。
    黑龙江日报关于肇源丰产经验的报道，是从去年十月中旬开始，到十二月中旬后才作了比较突出的宣传和推广。在开始时所遇到的困难是：编辑部干部对于肇源丰产经验不大了解，同时时间紧迫，需要迅速开始报道。另一方面，当时各地正在进行整党、基层干部冬季训练，冬季工作任务繁忙，通讯员参加报道活动的时间相对减少；特别是中共肇源县委当时对于在全县推广新耕作法以及领导农业生产的经验，还没有正式作出系统的总结。黑龙江日报就是在这种情况下，开始组织报道的。黑龙江日报抽出农村组一半以上的人力，学习了有关的指示、文件，然后两次组织记者组到肇源采访，边学、边做、“就地办公”。记者组通过个别访问、开座谈会等方式，向农业技术人员和老农民、推行新耕作法的积极分子学习，取得他们的帮助。经过学习
    （包括调查研究），提高了认识，对于新耕作法的内容也有了基本的了解，熟悉了群众生活和思想状况。这就有可能避免农业生产报道的老一套，而切合实际地提出问题，从群众实际生活中发掘生动活泼的东西，及时组织报道。例如，记者组帮助肇源县委及县里其他机关总结了在推广新耕作法当中的经验，及时组织报道，宣传了推广新耕作法和推进合作互助运动的关系，并通过丰产故事具体说明了群众的思想变化的过程。实行新耕作法后产量提高是很明显的，农民很容易接受，但对于提高粮食质量的作用认识不足。于是该报就从这方面发掘材料，通过“好香的小米饭”等故事来说明。在推行新耕作法中，群众比较难以接受的是间苗，说什么“两个穗顶一个穗，还多一根棍”。于是该报就用在事实面前信服了间苗好处和不相信间苗吃了亏的典型人物事例，前后呼应，说明间苗在增产上的作用。黑龙江日报还根据肇源推广新耕作法的经验及所遇到和已解决的问题，来指导了其他地区的推广工作。特别是根据通讯员所反映的情况和问题，报社两次派人到安广和海伦两县去了解推广肇源丰产经验的问题。在推广工作中，根据实际工作的发展，他们先后批判了几种不正确的思想与作法。最初有的人认为“冬季工作忙，推广肇源丰产经验可以缓一缓”，把推广肇源丰产经验和冬季工作对立起来；该报在批判这种思想的同时，一方面介绍了讷河县兴隆村结合丰产评比推行新耕作法的情况，和中共龙江县委如何围绕推广肇源丰产经验来推动各项工作的经验；另一方面，批判了安广县不重视推广肇源丰产经验，并配合社论加以分析说明。在各地干部比较重视推广工作以后，推广工作中的主要问题就是形式主义、一般化。这时，该报又研究了推广工作的经验，以及农民由不相信新耕作法到相信新耕作法的思想变化的规律性。于是以龙江县为重点，比较系统地介绍了推广工作的经验。上述报道方法证明，该报所以能够密切结合农村工作，切合实际地及时提出问题，打破老一套的报道形式，是和深入群众、调查研究分不开的。
    肇源丰产经验的内容，主要包括：肇源县委根据实际情况所总结出来的新耕作法，和肇源县委领导农业生产的群众路线的领导方法和工作方法。而新耕作法正是肇源县委领导农业生产的群众路线工作方法的产物。毛泽东同志在“组织起来”的讲演中说：“我们应该走到群众中间去，向群众学习，把他们的经验综合起来，成为更好的有条理的道理和办法，然后再告诉群众（宣传），并号召群众实行起来，解决群众的问题，使群众得到解放和幸福。”毛泽东同志在这里所指出的，也正是我们报纸工作者所必须遵守的群众路线的办报方法的基本原则。但这并非所有的报纸都经常执行得很好的。就是在黑龙江日报，也有的地方作得还不够好。例如，黑龙江日报对于肇源县委领导农业生产的工作作风和工作方法的宣传就不够深刻，不够生动，过多地偏重于具体的农业技术的宣传。这是主要的缺点。直到现在，这方面还没有显著改进。五月二十二日关于肇源县委总结春耕布置夏锄的报道中，过多地罗列了数目字；最后提到领导作风问题，只是说“根据‘少在上面，多在下面’深入领导生产的精神，会后组织各部门干部由负责同志率领深入各区贯彻会议的要求。”“少在上面，多在下面”这句话并不能正确地表达群众路线的意义。五月十四日报道了肇源县委在春耕中进一步发展了已有的经验。但是主要内容也是介绍具体农业技术，如“排开种，排开间”、“一次定苗”、“上好底粪，一次追肥”等。另一篇报道中用一个小孩子能背下肇源丰产经验的事实，来说明群众学习肇源丰产经验的“热情”和“有成绩”，也是不足令人信服的。
    当然，具体的农业技术是需要宣传的，但是这种技术宣传不能脱离群众路线的工作作风和工作方法。不掌握群众路线的工作方法，不仅不可能出现肇源丰产经验，而且也不可能真正推广。有些地方报纸在推广肇源丰产经验的宣传中，所以出现了形式主义和一般化的毛病，固然有许多原因，但最主要的正是因为没有掌握群众路线的工作方法，只是从形式上从技术上着眼进行宣传。特别是由于农业生产的地域性和小农经济的分散性，各地的工作基础不同，这一地区的农作技术常常不适合于另一地区，这就更需要着重宣传群众路线的工作方法。只有这样，才能在推广中逐步为农民所接受，因地制宜地有所补充和修正。这里牵涉到对推广肇源丰产经验的方针：“普遍宣传，重点推广”的理解问题。这个问题，林枫同志在东北行政委员会的一次会议上讲得很清楚：“普遍宣传是指肇源县委领导农业生产的工作作风和工作方法，这是到处都可以学习和采用的；重点推广是根据肇源丰产经验，研究并实行适合于当地的先进的耕作方法，因此这就不是硬搬肇源的经验。”党中央关于春耕生产给各级党委的指示中也明确指出：“必须深刻认识农业的地域性和小农经济的分散性，切忌机械搬用不适合当地情况的所谓‘科学技术’与一般化地推行某些不适合地区特点的技术改进计划。”“必须深入到农民群众中去，向群众学习，找出适合当地条件的原有的或新创造的先进技术经验，然后结合着农业科学技术理论，加以总结提高，逐步推广。”这是报纸关于推广农业技术必须遵守的基本原则。
    要生动地宣传群众路线的工作方法，就需要具有相当的思想水平；否则，或者是不能发现问题，或者只是抽象地讲讲道理。但是我们不能因为有困难就舍本求末。在这方面，黑龙江日报同样需要以极大的努力继续深入群众、深入实际，发掘这方面的材料，补救过去宣传中的缺点。
    尽管有这些缺点，仍然应当肯定：黑龙江日报组织肇源丰产经验的报道中所积累的经验是成功的，值得学习的。农村报道的老一套必须打破，而打破老一套的最根本的方法是学会群众路线的工作方法。要做到这一点，报纸工作者就必须具有满腔的热情，具有眼睛向下的决心，具有求知的渴望，以及放下架子、甘当小学生的精神。希望各报特别是农民报根据自己的具体情况，吸取黑龙江日报的经验，共同努力，把农村报道的水平提高一步。
