    Seize the Time to Eradicate Armyworms and Protect Summer Seedlings

    Adult armyworms have been discovered in some areas of the Northeast region, including the provinces of Rehe, Liaoxi, Liaodong, Jilin, Songjiang, Heilongjiang, and the suburbs of Lüda City. In the Central and Southern region, armyworms have occurred in more than twenty counties in Henan Province, thirty-nine counties in Hubei Province, and twelve counties in Guangxi Province. In Wengyuan County, Guangdong Province, the weeds on a mountain range fifteen li long and eight li wide in Tielong Township have been completely eaten by armyworms. In the East China region, armyworms are also growing in Jiangsu and Shandong. Armyworms have occurred in fourteen counties in Jiangsu Province, and some areas are very serious. Moths of armyworms have also occurred in many areas of Hebei and the suburbs of Beijing. This pest seriously threatens the summer seedlings of grain crops.

    This pest, due to different climates in different regions, occurs in two to six generations each year. It is a major pest of wheat and millet, and also harms rice in Guangdong, Guangxi, Fujian, and other places. This year, this pest has occurred very commonly and seriously, and all regions must be especially vigilant. The first and middle ten days of June are the time when the second generation of armyworm moths lay their eggs, which will hatch into insects in July. Therefore, inspections should be carried out in the first and middle ten days of June. In addition to collecting eggs and weeding (armyworm moths also lay eggs on weed leaves), methods such as knocking them down, ditching (digging ditches along the fields to trap the insects, then burying them with soil), and using armyworm catching carts should be used to eradicate the larvae.

    Many areas where armyworms have occurred are already carrying out prevention and control measures. In the Northeast region, Liaodong Province, with the demonstration breeding farms and technical guidance stations in counties such as Liaoyang, Zhuanghe, Dongfeng, and Tonghua as the core, has established a pest control information network with the main focus on preventing and controlling armyworms. The Agriculture Bureau of the Northeast Administrative Committee has sent a working group to Fuxian County, Liaodong, to investigate and study in order to summarize the masses' experience in preventing and controlling this pest.

    However, some areas are not vigilant enough about this pest, resulting in the spread of the insect disaster and varying degrees of loss. In Chenying Township, Xinliji District, Huaibin County, Henan Province, some cadres have shown a coercive style in leading the masses to eradicate armyworms. Some cadres have mistakenly put forward slogans such as "Not controlling insects is not patriotic" and "Whoever doesn't catch insects, let them eat insects," and have even detained farmers who do not control insects. Both of these situations should be corrected.

    抓紧时间除治黏虫保护夏苗
    中央农业部植物保护司
    东北区热河、辽西、辽东、吉林、松江、黑龙江等省的部分地区和旅大市郊发现了黏虫的成虫。中南区河南省二十多县、湖北省三十九个县、广西省十二县都发生了黏虫。广东省翁源县铁龙乡一座十五里长、八里宽的山上的杂草已被黏虫吃尽。华东区的江苏、山东，黏虫也正在生长。江苏省有十四县发生黏虫，部分地区非常严重。河北许多地区、北京市郊也发生了黏虫的蛾子。这种害虫严重地威胁着粮食作物的夏苗。
    这种害虫因各地气候不同，每年发生两代至六代不等，是麦类和谷子的主要害虫，在广东、广西、福建等地并且为害水稻。今年这种害虫发生得很普遍很严重，各地必须特别提高警惕。六月上、中旬是黏虫第二代蛾子产卵的时候，将于七月间孵化成虫。因此，在六月上、中旬要抓紧时间进行检查，除了采卵、锄草（黏虫蛾也产卵在杂草叶上）外，并应利用击落、沟杀（在田边挖沟，使虫落入，然后用土埋住）用黏虫车捕打等办法除治幼虫。
    现在发生黏虫的地区，多已进行防治。东北区辽东省以辽阳、庄河、东丰、通化等县的示范繁殖场和技术指导站为核心，有重点地建立了以防治黏虫为主的防虫情报网。东北行政委员会农业局为总结群众防治这种虫害的经验，并派工作组到辽东复县进行调查研究。
    但有些地区对这种虫害还不够警惕，以致虫灾蔓延，造成不同程度的损失。河南省淮滨县新里集区陈营乡等地干部在领导群众除治黏虫中有强迫命令作风，有些干部错误地提出“不治虫就是不爱国”、
    “那个不捕虫，叫他吃虫”等口号，还扣押了不治虫的农民。这两种情形都应当加以纠正。
