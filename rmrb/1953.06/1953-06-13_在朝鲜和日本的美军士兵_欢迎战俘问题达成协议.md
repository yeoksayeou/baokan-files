    U.S. Soldiers in Korea and Japan
    Welcome Agreement on POW Issue
    [Xinhua News Agency, June 12] U.S. soldiers in Korea and Japan warmly welcome the news of the agreement on the prisoner-of-war issue.
    According to reports from American and British reporters, U.S. soldiers at the Korean front were extremely happy to hear this news. The news felt like "a gentle spring breeze" to them. They are considering: "How will peace affect them, how soon can they go home, and how happy will their families be when they return?"
    U.S. Army Sergeant Floyd Meis District said, "This war is about to end, and no one is happier than I am." Marine Corps Sergeant Wa斯特 said he hopes the armistice "will keep me from coming to Korea again, and my children from coming to Korea – they are only five or six years away from being drafted." A soldier who has been in Korea for ten months said he hopes the armistice "will mean soldiers can retire early." Private Reynolds said:
    "This will be a good thing; soldiers should get such good things."
    U.S. soldiers stationed in Japan have the same reaction. According to Kyodo News Agency: At the Itazuke base in Fukuoka Prefecture, where the long-term tension has been relieved, pilots with happy faces are everywhere loudly discussing the armistice issue. At the Sasebo base, American soldiers were all smiles and were toasting each other in bars. At the Nara convalescent station, as soon as you walked in, you could hear soldiers singing in chorus from afar, shouting "So happy" after each verse. Sergeant Ganli said: "I am so happy that I don’t know what to do. I want to go home quickly to see my wife and two children.” Sergeant Burns said:
    "I feel so relieved. I hope this is a lasting peace."

    在朝鲜和日本的美军士兵
    欢迎战俘问题达成协议
    【新华社十二日讯】在朝鲜和日本的美军士兵，都热烈欢迎战俘问题达成协议的消息。
    据美、英记者报道，朝鲜前线的美军士兵听到这个消息后，都感到无限高兴。这个消息对他们好像“一股温和的春风”。他们在考虑：“和平将怎样影响他们，他们多久就可以回家，回家后家属们将感到的快乐。”
    美军上士弗洛伊德·梅斯区说：“这场战争就将结束，没有人比我更高兴。”海军陆战队上士华斯特表示，希望停战“使我不再来朝鲜，我的孩子们也不来朝鲜——他们离被征服役的年龄只差五、六岁。”一个在朝鲜十个月的兵士说，他希望停战“能意味着士兵们早日退役”。上等兵雷诺德斯说：
    “这将是一件好事，士兵们应当得到这种好东西。”
    驻在日本的美军士兵有同样的反应。据共同社报道：在福冈县板付基地解除了长期紧张状态的机场上，到处都有满脸高兴的飞行员在大声地谈论着停战问题。在佐世保基地，美国士兵都喜笑颜开，三三五五在酒吧间里举杯致贺。在奈良休养站，一走进去，从很远的地方就可以听见大兵们合唱的声音，每唱一节，就连着喊几声：“真快活”。上等兵甘利说：“我高兴得不知如何是好，我愿意赶快回家去看我的妻子和两个孩子。”上士布伦斯说：
    “真放心了。我希望这是持久的和平。”
