Xinhua News Agency, Washington, June 24th: The U.S. House of Representatives passed the "Foreign Aid" bill on the 19th, stipulating the allocation of $4.998 billion in the 1953-1954 fiscal year to continue preparing for new wars and engaging in expansion globally. The new "Foreign Aid" bill has a more purely military nature than previous ones and particularly emphasizes aggression and expansion in the Asian region.

More than four-fifths of the "aid" funds passed by the House are directly or indirectly military "aid," including a total of more than $1.56 billion earmarked for the Asian and Pacific regions, including $400 million for the Vietnam colonial war; in addition, it stipulates so-called "technical assistance" expenses for this region at over $72 million.

The House's "Foreign Aid" bill includes a new provision that advocates forming a Pacific military alliance in the East, modeled after the North Atlantic aggressive bloc. During the House debate on this provision, Republican Representative Burdick pointed out that the United States was "starting a new adventure" by doing so.

The new "Foreign Aid" bill shows that the United States continues to arrange for West Germany and Japan to be its main striking forces in the future for launching new wars. The bill stipulates approximately $340 million for the rearmament of West Germany and threatens to withhold half of the stipulated "aid" to Europe to force Western European countries to quickly ratify the "European Defense Community" treaty, the main purpose of which is to restore West Germany's aggressive forces through the form of a "European Army." The bill keeps the rearmament expenses for Japan secret, but according to United Press International citing "authoritative sources," the amount is approximately $200 million.

According to newspapers, the "Foreign Aid" bill also includes approximately $100 million as funding for organizing subversive and destructive "anti-communist underground activities" in Asia and Europe.

    美众院通过“援外”法案
    拨巨款供侵略之用
    【新华社二十四日讯】华盛顿消息：美国众议院十九日通过了“援外”法案，规定在一九五三—一九五四年度拨款四十九亿九千八百万美元供继续在全球准备新战争和进行扩张之用。新的“援外”法案较以往具有更纯粹的军事性质，并特别着重了对亚洲地区的侵略和扩张。
    众院通过的“援”款五分之四以上是直接或间接的军事“援助”，其中规定用于亚洲和太平洋区域的总数达十五亿六千余万美元，包括用于越南殖民战争的四亿美元；另外规定用在这个地区的所谓“技术援助”费用为七千二百余万美元。
    众院“援外”法案包括一项新的规定，主张按北大西洋侵略集团式样在东方组成一个太平洋军事联盟。在众院辩论这一规定时，共和党众议员伯迪克就已指出：美国这样做是“开始一个新的冒险”。
    新的“援外”法案表明，美国继续安排西德和日本作为它发动新战争的未来的主要突击力量。法案规定以约三亿四千万美元供重新武装西德之用，并以扣发规定“援”欧费用的一半为要挟，要西欧国家迅速批准“欧洲防务集团”条约，这个条约的主要目的就是通过“欧洲军”的形式来恢复西德的侵略军队。法案规定给日本的重新武装费用秘而不宣，但据合众社引“权威人士”透露的消息说，为数大约二亿美元。
    据报纸透露，“援外”法案还包括约一亿美元，作为在亚洲和欧洲组织颠覆破坏的“反共地下活动”的经费。
