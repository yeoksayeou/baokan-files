Various rivers across the country have entered or are about to enter the flood season, and flood prevention organizations have been established in various regions one after another. As of the end of May, the Central Flood Control Headquarters has reported the establishment of the Central South Region Flood Control, Drought Prevention, and Drought Resistance Production Joint Headquarters, the Northeast Region Flood Control Headquarters, and the flood prevention command agencies of Guangdong, Jiangxi, Henan, Hunan, and Jiangsu provinces. The flood prevention organizations of Shandong and Suiyuan provinces were established in early June.

The Central South Region Flood Control, Drought Prevention, and Drought Resistance Production Joint Headquarters issued an instruction on flood prevention work on May 26, requiring all regions to, based on local conditions and taking into account the interests of the masses, promptly and thoroughly mobilize and organize the masses, clearly explain the flood prevention plans and technical measures to the masses, appropriately adjust forces, and equip themselves with materials to make full preparations for flood prevention work. In order to eliminate or reduce hidden dangers inside the dyke body, efforts should be made to promote the steel cone drilling method for inspecting the Yellow River dykes, to identify weaknesses and repair and reinforce them at any time. Flood reporting should be accurate and timely, and water conditions should be carefully studied and analyzed to improve the predictability of flood prevention work.

The East China Administrative Committee issued a flood prevention instruction at the end of May, requiring all provinces and cities to strengthen their leadership over flood prevention work and establish provincial (municipal) flood prevention headquarters before June 10. The flood prevention work of the Xinshu River is to be jointly undertaken by Jiangsu and Shandong provinces, with Jiangsu Province responsible for administrative leadership and Shandong Province responsible for technical guidance. The flood prevention work in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River is to be the responsibility of Jiangsu and Anhui provinces respectively. The Yangtze River Lower Reaches Engineering Bureau will participate in the flood prevention organizations of Jiangsu and Anhui provinces respectively, and the technical cadres of each repair and prevention office will participate in the flood prevention organizations of relevant special districts and counties. The instruction also pointed out that there are still many problems with the river dykes and seawalls in East China. For example, the water conditions in the Yangtze River were stable last year, but dangers still occurred in the main dykes in the lower reaches; although the Yi and Shu New Rivers have been used for water flow, they have not yet been tested by floods; before the flood season, dangerous works have already occurred in the Zhejiang seawall; the dangerous Datang of the Tiaoxi River leaks every flood season; and the dykes in the lower reaches of the Minjiang River were found to have cracks and slope failures as soon as the project was completed. Relevant departments should immediately conduct thorough inspections, repair defects, and eliminate hidden dangers. Places such as the Gaohu Reservoir of the Puyang River and the Nanhu Flood Storage Project of the Tiaoxi River that are prepared to control floods during the flood season must first carry out propaganda and education to cadres and the masses, explaining the role of the reservoir, clarifying the principle of subordinating small interests to large interests, formulating compensation methods, and publicizing them after discussion by the masses to dispel the masses' concerns, stabilize production sentiment, and avoid disputes. The instruction also pointed out that the management of sluices and dams should be strengthened, with special personnel responsible for the management of culvert sluices and dams, to grasp water conditions, and open and close them in a timely manner.

The North China Administrative Committee's Water Conservancy Bureau organized a flood prevention inspection team in Hebei Province to inspect flood prevention work in key rivers such as the Daqing River and the Yongding River. The Huai River Management Committee also convened a flood prevention meeting in mid-May with responsible flood prevention cadres from engineering departments and relevant special districts and counties in the upper, middle, and lower reaches to discuss the guarantee tasks and defense scope of each embankment section, the operation and management of Menghe, Chengxi and other lakes and depressions, and Wangjiaba, Runheji and other dams and sluices, and the allocation of funds. Jiangxi Province dispatched cadres to form seven inspection teams, which have been going to key weirs and dykes in various places since April 24 to conduct in-depth inspections of flood prevention organizations, material preparation, dyke line guarding, and other situations; and solicit opinions from local governments at all levels, and solve problems and difficulties on the spot as much as possible. At the water conservancy meeting in Liaoxi Province in late May, it was particularly pointed out that Liaoxi is characterized by drought followed by flooding, and non-drought is followed by flooding, and all counties and cities should be vigilant.

Because a large amount of river interception and water diversion and dyke excavation have been carried out in various places this year, and many places have neglected management and maintenance work, the dykes of many medium and small rivers have been damaged to varying degrees, and the flood prevention agencies and local party and government leading organs should not ignore the flood prevention work of medium and small rivers.

    全国各地积极准备防汛工作
    全国各江河已进入或即将进入汛期，各地领导防汛的机构相继成立。到五月底为止，向中央防汛总指挥部报告成立的有中南区防汛防旱抗旱生产联合总指挥部、东北区防汛总指挥部以及广东、江西、河南、湖南、江苏等省防汛指挥机关。山东、绥远两省防汛机构于六月初成立。
    中南区防汛防旱抗旱生产联合总指挥部五月二十六日发布了防汛工作指示，要求各地根据当地具体情况，照顾群众利益，及早深入动员和组织群众，把防汛计划和技术措施向群众交代清楚，适当调整力量，配备器材，为防汛做好充分准备工作；为了消除或减少堤身内部的隐患，要大力推广检查黄河堤防的钢锥钻探法，查出弱点随时修补加固；报汛要准确及时，并精密地研究分析水情，以提高防汛工作的预见性。
    华东行政委员会于五月底发出防汛指示，要求各省、市加强对防汛工作的领导，并于六月十日前，分别成立省（市）防汛总指挥部。新沭河的防汛工作，由江苏、山东两省成立联合防汛机构负责；江苏省负责行政领导，山东省负责技术指导。长江下游的防汛工作，由江苏、安徽两省各自负责。长江下游工程局分别参加江苏、安徽两省防汛组织；各修防处的技术干部参加有关专区、县的防汛组织。指示中还指出华东各河堤防及海塘目前仍有不少问题。如长江去年水情平稳，但下游干堤仍然发生险象；沂、沭新河虽已行水，尚未经过洪水考验；浙江海塘未到汛期，已经发生险工；苕溪西险大塘，每逢汛期都发生渗漏现象；闽江下游堤防，工程刚完即发现裂缝脱坡情况。有关部门应该立刻深入检查，修补残缺，消除隐患。浦阳江高湖水库和苕溪南湖蓄洪工程等准备汛期控制洪水的地方，必须事先向干部、群众进行宣传教育，说明水库的作用，讲清小利服从大利的道理，订好赔偿办法，经过群众讨论后公布，以解除群众顾虑，安定生产情绪，避免发生纠纷。指示还指出要加强闸坝的管理工作，由专人负责管理涵洞闸坝，掌握水情，及时启闭。
    华北行政委员会水利局组织了河北省防汛检查组，赴大清河、永定河等重点河流检查防汛工作。治淮委员会也于五月中旬召集上、中、下游各工程部门及有关专区、县负责防汛干部开防汛会议，讨论各堤段应保证任务和设防范围，濛河、城西等湖、洼和王家坝、润河集等坝闸的运用管理，和经费分配等问题。江西省抽调干部组成七个检查小组，自四月二十四日起，分赴各地重点圩堤，深入检查防汛组织、器材准备、堤线守护等情况；并征求各级地方政府意见，如发现问题及有困难情形尽可能就地解决。辽西省在五月下旬的水利会议上，特别指出了辽西先旱后涝、非旱即涝的特点，要各县、市提高警惕。
    由于今年各地大量截河引水，扒堤开口，许多地方忽视管理养护工作，许多中、小河流的堤防受到了不同程度的损坏，各地防汛机构和地方党政领导机关对于中小河流的防汛工作也不可忽视。
