    The Central People's Government's Ministry of Textile Industry, in order to overcome the current phenomenon of lack of accountability in the production of state-owned textile factories, recently issued instructions to its subordinate bureaus and factories to establish and improve various responsibility systems. The instructions pointed out: at present, the bureaus and factories lack a comprehensive responsibility system for how to complete various planned targets. Generally, only the output target is emphasized, while various responsibility systems are lacking to guarantee cost, labor, quality, supply and other planned targets. Therefore, in the process of implementing the plan, there is often mutual disconnection, and production cannot be organized in a balanced and comprehensive manner; for various technical measures to improve product quality and reduce breakage rates (such as operating methods, technical management systems, etc.), there is no dedicated unified organization or dedicated person in charge, and other technical management work also lacks clear division of labor and unified leadership. The main reasons for this phenomenon of no one being responsible are: First, leading cadres have serious bureaucratism, lack a unified and comprehensive guiding ideology for production management and business management of factories and enterprises, lack serious research and organization to implement policies, and lack systematic investigation and research on the situation of their own enterprises and factories. Therefore, they cannot grasp the main links in the work, and do not pay enough attention to the seriousness of establishing systems. Some of the original systems are divorced from reality and the masses; some systems were originally good, but because they did not pay attention to supervision and inspection, they could not be consolidated, became a formality, and could not play a practical role. Second, the organizational structure is unreasonable, the division of labor is unclear, and there is a lack of clear responsibilities, mutual prevarication, and lack of contact with each other. For example, the scope of responsibilities of the engineer's office is unclear, which makes it impossible for engineers to play their active role in production. Some factories even lack a clear division of labor between the factory director, deputy factory director, workshop director, and deputy director. The instructions emphasized that at present, all bureaus and factories should discuss plans and strengthen plan management, and on the basis of this, according to work needs and conditions, and based on priorities and urgency, they should systematically and step-by-step grasp several key systems in their own units, and conduct research to resolve these issues. Based on the situation of general factories, the responsibility system for production management should be established first. Ensure that national plan targets have dedicated agencies and dedicated personnel responsible for them; make clear to all levels of institutions in the factory and all administrative cadres, technical personnel, and workers their specific responsibilities in production, so as to ensure the comprehensive completion of the national plan. How to establish a responsibility system? The instructions pointed out: First, in conjunction with work inspection and opposition to bureaucratism, expose
    the phenomenon of no one being responsible in the factory, find the root cause, and gradually establish a practical and feasible responsibility system, oppose impatience, and oppose the practice of starting everything from scratch. Second, it must be combined with the current production tasks, and it must be combined with strengthening technical operating systems and operating methods, that is to say, it must be combined with the implementation and consolidation of advanced working methods. For example, in terms of operation, the establishment of a responsibility system should be combined with consolidating the "Hao Jianxiu Working Method" and
    the "1951 Weaving Working Method." In terms of maintenance, the establishment of a responsibility system should be combined with consolidating the "1953 Textile Machine Maintenance Working Method." At the same time, the existing systems in the past should also be
    studied and identified, and practical systems should be affirmed and conscientiously implemented. Third, the establishment of a responsibility system should be combined with solving the current problems existing in the factory, such as in the establishment of a safety responsibility system, we should check the completion of this year's ventilation and cooling equipment and plans, and check and supervise them through the establishment of a responsibility system. Fourth, after the responsibility system is established, a strict inspection system should be established to frequently check and discover places where the system does not conform to the actual situation, and correct them in time, so as to ensure the implementation and consolidation of the system.

    中央纺织工业部指示所属各局厂
    建立生产责任制度克服无人负责现象
    中央人民政府纺织工业部，为了克服目前在各国营纺织厂生产中的无人负责现象，于日前向所属各局厂发出建立与健全各种责任制度的指示。指示指出：目前各局、厂对如何完成各种计划指标，缺乏全面负责的责任制度，一般只注意产量指标，而对成本、劳动、质量、供应等计划指标，则缺乏各种责任制度的保证。因此，在执行计划的过程中，常常互相脱节，不能均衡地全面地组织生产；对提高产品质量及降低断头率等工作的各项技术措施（如操作方法、技术管理制度等），没有专门的统一机构及专人负责，其它技术管理工作也缺乏明确分工与统一领导。造成这种无人负责现象的主要原因是：一、领导干部存在严重的官僚主义，对工厂企业的生产管理与经营管理缺乏统一的全面指导思想，缺乏对政策的认真研究与组织贯彻，缺乏对本企业本工厂情况的系统的调查研究，因此，抓不住工作中的主要环节，对建立制度的严肃性重视不够，原来的制度有些是脱离实际、脱离群众的；有些制度本来是好的，但因不注意督促检查，也不能巩固，流于形式，不能发挥实际作用。二、组织机构不合理，分工不清，缺乏明确的职责范围，互相推诿，互不联系。如工程师室的职责范围不清，便使工程师无法在生产中发挥其积极作用。有些工厂甚至在厂长、副厂长及车间主任、副主任之间也缺乏明确的分工。指示强调指出：目前各局、厂均应在讨论计划，加强计划管理的基础上，根据工作需要与工作条件，分别轻重缓急，有计划有步骤地抓住本单位带关键性的几种制度，加以研究解决。根据一般厂的情况，目前应首先建立生产管理上的责任制。做到国家计划指标有专责机构和专人负责；使工厂中各级机构和所有行政干部、技术人员、工人都明确自己在生产中的具体责任，以保证国家计划的全面完成。如何建立责任制度呢？指示指出：一、结合工作检查和反对官僚主义，揭露出
    工厂中的无人负责现象，并找出根源，逐步地建立起切实可行的责任制度，反对急躁情绪，反对百废俱兴的做法。二、必须要和当前的生产任务相结合，要和加强技术操作制度与操作方法相结合，也就是说要与贯彻巩固先进工作法相结合。如在运转
    方面，建立责任制应与巩固“郝建秀工作法”与
    “一九五一织布工作法”相结合。在保全方面，建立责任制应与巩固“一九五三年纺织机器保全工作法”相结合。同时对过去已有的制度，亦应加以
    研究甄别，切合实际的制度应加以肯定，并认真地贯彻下去。三、建立责任制度应与解决当前工厂中
    存在的问题结合起来，如在建立安全责任制中，即应检查今年的通风降温设备和计划完成情况，并通过建立责任制度，加以检查督促。四、责任制度建立起来以后，即应建立严格的检查制度，经常检查和发现制度不符合实际情况之处，及时予以修正，这样才能保证制度的贯彻和巩固。
