    Serious Shortcomings in Fertilizer Supply Work of Cooperatives in Pengze County, Jiangxi

    A letter from Deng Fuxing in Pengze County, Jiangxi Province: There are serious shortcomings in the fertilizer supply work of cooperatives in Pengze County. The cooperative purchased rapeseed cakes and sesame cakes from private oil workshops in the third district at a price of 41,000 to 42,000 yuan per 100 jin. However, when they sold them to farmers locally, the price was 55,000 yuan per 100 jin. The rapeseed cakes purchased by the cooperative from private oil workshops in the fifth district cost 38,000 yuan per 100 jin, but when resold to farmers, they cost 45,000 yuan per 100 jin, and when transported to the seventh district and sold to farmers, they cost 61,000 yuan per 100 jin. The farmers all said that the fertilizer cakes were too expensive, but the county cooperative said that this was the "lowest practical price." Farmers were unwilling to buy the cooperative's expensive fertilizer cakes, which affected production; the cooperative's fertilizers were also stockpiled in warehouses and could not be sold. When Ma Shitong, the deputy director of the Pengze County Cooperative, led six cadres to Datang Township in the third district to carry out key experimental work in promoting fertilizers, they forced farmers to use 26.65 jin of fertilizer powder, 28.5 jin of fertilizer cakes, and 2.3 jin of gypsum per mu. When the farmers didn't want them, Ma Shitong said without thinking, "I guarantee the bank will give you loans." As of early June, the cooperative had not yet sold half of its fertilizers, and a large quantity of fertilizer cakes were moldy in the warehouse. The Pengze County Cooperative's operating methods and work style should be corrected immediately.

### 江西彭泽县合作社肥料供应工作中有严重缺点

    江西彭泽县合作社肥料供应工作中有严重缺点
    江西省彭泽县邓复兴来信：彭泽县合作社肥料供应工作中有严重缺点。该社向三区私人油房购进菜饼和麻饼，每百斤价格四万一、二千元；但他们就地卖给农民，每百斤却要五万五千元。该社向五区私人油房购进的菜饼，每百斤三万八千元，转卖给农民时每百斤就要四万五千元，运到七区卖给农民每百斤就要六万一千元。农民们都说枯饼太贵，县社却说这是“最低的实际价格”。农民不愿买合作社的高价枯饼，生产受了影响；合作社的肥料也积压在仓库里推销不出去。彭泽县合作社副主任马世同率领干部六人到三区大塘乡搞推销肥料的重点试验工作时，竟按亩强迫摊派肥田粉二十六斤十一两，枯饼二十八斤十两，石膏二斤六两。农民们不要，马世同就信口说：“我保证银行贷款给你们。”截至六月初，该社肥料尚未推销出一半，大批枯饼都在仓库内发霉。彭泽县合作社这样的经营方式和工作作风应该立即纠正。
