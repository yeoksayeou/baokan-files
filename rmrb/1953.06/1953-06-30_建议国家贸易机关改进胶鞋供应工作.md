    Suggestions for National Trade Organs to Improve Rubber Shoe Supply Work
    Xiao Lang from Qiannan County Cooperative, Jiangxi, writes: The "Readers' Letters Summary" column on May 20th reflected that the Kailuan Coal Mine Workers' Consumer Cooperative in Tangshan had to bundle large and small sizes together when purchasing rubber shoes, resulting in a shortage of large-size rubber shoes and a large backlog of small-size rubber shoes. The situation of our Dajishan Mining Area Consumer Cooperative and seven rural cooperatives in Qiannan County is exactly the opposite of that of the Kailuan Coal Mine Cooperative. Each box of rubber shoes we receive has an average of two to three dozen pairs of large sizes (size 39 and above) bundled with it, resulting in a large backlog of large-size rubber shoes. We suggest that national trade organs or production units make appropriate adjustments when supplying rubber shoes. This will not only meet the needs of consumers in various regions, but also reduce the phenomenon of cooperatives having tied up funds.

### 建议国家贸易机关改进胶鞋供应工作

    建议国家贸易机关改进胶鞋供应工作
    江西虔南县合作社萧朗来信：五月二十日“读者来信摘要”栏中反映：唐山开滦煤矿职工消费合作社因购入胶鞋时要大小号搭卖，因此大号胶鞋供不应求，小号胶鞋大批积压。我们虔南县大吉山矿区消费合作社及七个农村合作社的情况恰恰与开滦煤矿合作社的情况相反。我们调入的胶鞋每箱平均要搭大号（三十九码以上）两打至三打，因此大号胶鞋积压很多。我们建议国家贸易机关或生产单位供应胶鞋时应作适当的调剂。这样不仅能适应各地消费者的需要，也可使合作社减少积压资金的现象。
