Major state-owned factories and mines in Shenyang, Anshan, Harbin, Dalian, Benxi, and Changchun are mobilizing workers to analyze and inspect original records and quotas, and to prepare operational plans, in order to improve and strengthen internal planned management.

Before carrying out this work, factories and mines in Northeast China first conducted a detailed investigation and study of the past planned management work, and formulated specific methods for further improving planned management. Then, they carried out ideological education on strengthening planned management among cadres, so that they clearly understood the significance and content of planned management. For example, leading cadres of the Wusan Factory and Shenyang Smelting Plant first studied many instructions and documents related to planned management, and then organized all cadres to study. After the leaders of Machinery Factory No. 6 organized relevant personnel to study the instructions and documents on planned management, they also mobilized technicians and staff to conduct ideological self-criticism in light of the spirit of the documents. In mid-May, Machinery Factory No. 15 also held a short-term training class on planned management, specifically absorbing workshop planners, dispatchers, section chiefs, industrial affairs personnel, process personnel, team leaders, and personnel from the production section for twenty-six days of study. In this way, a good foundation was laid for strengthening the internal planned management of enterprises.

In carrying out this work, factories and mines in Northeast China generally paid attention to focusing on key points and proceeding in a focused and step-by-step manner based on the specific conditions of their own enterprises. For example, the Wusan Factory plans to start by improving operational plans and further organizing rhythmic production. Other work related to capital management, grassroots statistics, quota setting, staffing, and mobilizing labor organization will be carried out in a planned and step-by-step manner around the central link of organizing rhythmic production. The Shenyang Smelting Plant plans to first concentrate its efforts on breaking through the actual metal recovery rate quota, changing the current situation where the main metal recovery rate quota cannot be completed, and then improving quota management and original records, preparing operational plans, and carrying out rhythmic and balanced production by ten-day period and by furnace. At present, some factories and mines are conducting key experiments in workshops or pit mouths according to pre-formulated plans, and some factories and mines have fully launched the work of strengthening planned management, and further mobilized workers and technical personnel to carry out labor competitions and "know-how" movements, put forward suggestions on strengthening planned management, and formulate realistic and feasible advanced planned management systems, in order to achieve a balanced and comprehensive completion of the state production plan.

    沈阳、鞍山、哈尔滨等地主要国营厂矿
    正在进一步加强计划管理工作
    沈阳、鞍山、哈尔滨、旅大、本溪和长春等地的主要国营工厂和矿山，正在发动职工分析检查原始记录和定额，编制作业计划，以健全和改进企业内部的计划管理工作。
    东北各厂矿在进行这一工作前，首先对过去计划管理工作的情况进行了细致的调查研究，订出了进一步改进计划管理工作的具体办法。然后又在干部中进行了加强计划管理的思想教育，使他们明确地认识计划管理的意义和内容。如五三工厂和沈阳冶炼厂的领导干部，先学习了许多有关计划管理的指示和文件，然后又组织所有干部进行了学习。机械六厂在组织有关人员学习了计划管理的指示和文件以后，还发动技术人员和职员联系文件精神进行了思想检查。机械十五厂在五月中旬还举办了一期计划管理短期训练班，专门吸收车间计划员、执令员、工段长、工务员、工序员、组长和生产科的人员进行了二十六天的学习。这样，就为加强企业内部的计划管理工作打下了良好基础。
    东北各厂矿在进行这项工作中，一般都注意到根据本企业的具体情况，抓住主要关键，有重点有步骤地进行。如五三工厂计划首先要从改进作业计划和进一步组织有节奏生产着手，其他有关资金管理、基层统计、定额定员和调动劳动组织等方面的工作，都围绕着组织有节奏生产这一中心环节有计划有步骤地进行。沈阳冶炼厂计划首先集中力量突破金属实收率定额，改变目前完不成主要金属实收率定额的状况，然后再改进定额管理和原始记录，订好作业计划，按旬按炉进行有节奏的均衡生产。现在，有些厂矿正在根据预先制订的计划，在车间或坑口进行重点试验，有些厂矿已经全面展开了加强计划管理的工作，并进一步发动工人和技职人员开展劳动竞赛和找“窍门”运动，提出有关加强计划管理的建议，制订现实可行的先进计划管理制度，以达到均衡全面地完成国家生产计划。
