Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, June 29th. The Polish People's Republic Mazowsze Song and Dance Ensemble, after a two-month visit and performance tour in our country, departed Shenyang for home on the 29th. Zhang Dongchuan, Deputy Director of the Cultural Bureau of the Northeast Administrative Council, Wei Jieren, Director of the Cultural Department of the Political Department of the Northeast Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and over a thousand representatives from cultural and artistic circles in Northeast China and Shenyang, went to the station to see them off.

After arriving in Shenyang on June 19th, the Polish People's Republic Mazowsze Song and Dance Ensemble performed five shows for workers, soldiers, literary and art workers, and students in Shenyang, and one show in Fushun, the famous Chinese coal capital, with a total audience of over 90,000 people. The ensemble's many wonderful programs, rich in national characteristics and folk art styles, were warmly praised by people from all walks of life in Shenyang and Fushun. The Northeast Daily, Shenyang Daily, and Fushun Daily all published news about the ensemble's performances and articles by literary and art workers and introductions to the ensemble in prominent positions. The Northeast Daily and Shenyang Daily also published pictorials of the ensemble's performances. The Northeast People's Broadcasting Station and Shenyang People's Broadcasting Station also broadcast live recordings of the ensemble's performances in Shenyang for several consecutive days.

During their stay in Shenyang and Fushun, the ensemble visited the Northeast Industrial Exhibition Hall, the Gaokan Village Agricultural Production Cooperative in the suburbs of Shenyang, the famous Fushun Open-pit Coal Mine, and the large-scale Fushun Oil Refinery. The ensemble also held a joint evening party with literary and art workers from Northeast China and Shenyang. Before the ensemble left Fushun, the cultural and artistic circles of Fushun presented the ensemble members with art pieces made of natural amber, a special product of the coal capital, refined into collar flowers and cufflinks, and peace doves carved from coal essence.

On the 27th, the ensemble held a closing ceremony in Shenyang to conclude its performances and visits in our country. At the beginning of the closing ceremony, Wang Manshuo, Director of the Cultural Bureau of the Northeast Administrative Council, first delivered a speech on behalf of the Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government. He said: The performances and visits of the Polish People's Republic Mazowsze Song and Dance Ensemble in cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, Nanjing, Xi'an, Guangzhou, Tianjin, Shenyang, and Fushun in our country have not only promoted cultural and artistic exchanges between China and Poland but also greatly enhanced and developed the profound friendship between the people of China and Poland. The head of the ensemble, Mr. M. Dombrovsky, said in his reply: We have learned a lot in China, and the trip to China has left an indelible impression on our minds. All the performances in various parts of China, especially the performance in front of the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, in May this year, are a glorious page in the history of the young Mazowsze Song and Dance Ensemble. We firmly believe that the increasing cultural exchanges between the two peoples will surely further consolidate and deepen the profound friendship between the two peoples.

    波兰玛佐夫舍歌舞团离沈阳返国
   【新华社沈阳二十九日电】波兰人民共和国玛佐夫舍歌舞团应邀来我国访问和演出了两个月后，已在二十九日离沈阳返国。东北行政委员会文化局副局长张东川、中国人民解放军东北军区政治部文化部部长卫孑人及东北和沈阳市文化艺术界代表等共一千多人前往车站欢送。
    波兰人民共和国玛佐夫舍歌舞团于六月十九日到达沈阳后，为沈阳工人、部队、文艺工作者、学生等演出了五场，到著名的中国煤都抚顺演出了一场，观众共达九万多人。歌舞团表演的许多富有民族色彩和民间艺术风格的精彩节目，受到沈阳和抚顺市各界人民的热烈赞赏。东北日报、沈阳日报和抚顺日报都以显著地位刊载了歌舞团演出活动的新闻以及文艺工作者的论文和关于歌舞团的介绍文章。东北日报和沈阳日报还出版了歌舞团演出活动的画刊。东北人民广播电台和沈阳人民广播电台并连日转播了歌舞团在沈阳演出的实况。
    歌舞团在沈阳和抚顺期间，曾先后参观了东北工业陈列馆、沈阳市郊高坎村农业生产合作社、著名的抚顺露天煤矿和规模宏大的抚顺制油厂。歌舞团还与东北和沈阳市文艺工作者举行了一次联欢晚会。在歌舞团离开抚顺临行前，抚顺市文化艺术界曾将煤都特产的天然琥珀精制成的领花、袖扣和用煤精刻成的和平鸽等艺术品，赠送给歌舞团团员。
    二十七日，歌舞团在沈阳举行了结束在我国演出和访问的闭幕式。闭幕式开始，首先由东北行政委员会文化局局长王曼硕代表中央人民政府文化部致词。他说：波兰人民共和国玛佐夫舍歌舞团在我国北京、上海、南京、西安、广州、天津、沈阳、抚顺等城市的演出和访问，不仅增进了中波两国的文化艺术交流，而且大大增强和发展了中波两国人民的深厚友谊。歌舞团团长米·顿巴鲁夫斯基在答词中说：我们在中国学习了很多东西，中国之行在我们脑中留下了不可磨灭的印象。所有在中国各地的演出，特别是今年五月在中国人民伟大领袖毛主席面前的演出，都是年青的玛佐夫舍歌舞团历史上光荣的一页。我们深信，两国人民间文化交流的日益加强，必然会进一步巩固和加深两国人民间的深厚友谊。
