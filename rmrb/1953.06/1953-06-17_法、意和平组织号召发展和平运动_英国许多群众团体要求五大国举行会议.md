Xinhua News Agency, June 16th: According to TASS, Paris, June 13th: The movement to mobilize all the people's strength to strive for peace is growing stronger and stronger in France.

This movement was initiated by the French National Peace Council. As the date for the National Conference for Peaceful Negotiations, to be held in Paris on June 27th and 28th, draws closer, more and more people are participating in this movement.

In cities and villages, in factory workshops and homes, thousands of peace fighters are distributing the "Peace Handbook," which lists the people's demands: to hold peace negotiations and stop the various wars currently underway.

Peace demonstrations and rallies are being held throughout the country. According to "l'Humanité," a total of 102 mass rallies demanding peace have been held in 42 French departments. These rallies unanimously demanded an end to the war in Vietnam, rejection of the Bonn and Paris war treaties, the holding of a four-power peace conference to peacefully resolve the German question, and that France take necessary actions for peace. People are also preparing to convene provincial peace conferences. Countless organizations have responded to the call of the French National Peace Council, expressing their willingness to participate in the upcoming National Conference for Peaceful Negotiations.

Xinhua News Agency, June 16th: TASS, Rome, June 15th: The Italian National Peace Council announced that, to coincide with the third anniversary of the Korean War and the World Peace Council meeting in Budapest on June 15th, Italy will hold a "Week of Propaganda for Peace in Korea and the World." Many conferences and rallies will be held during this week.

The Italian Peace Committee issued a proclamation to the people saying: "For these years, millions of Italians have fought for peace together with billions of people in all countries of the world. On June 7th, millions of Italians expressed their desire for peace and thoroughly condemned the government and parties that thought they could disregard the solemn wishes of the nation. The people's desire for peace must be respected! End the Cold War! Abolish foreign bases in Italy! The treaty to organize the 'European Defense Community,' which destroys our country's army and revives German militarism, must be opposed. End the unlimited arms race. All sincere patriots unite so that their aspirations for peace can be considered; make the third anniversary of the Korean War a day for striving for a peaceful government and Italy's prosperity."

Xinhua News Agency, June 15th: TASS, London, June 13th: The Association of Supervisory Staffs, Executives and Technicians, with 16,000 members, held a conference in Clacton, at which a resolution was passed calling for sincere meetings between the leaders of the major powers.

The conference also passed a resolution: demanding that the People's Republic of China be allowed to join the United Nations, and expressing opposition to the Bonn military agreement and the remilitarization of West Germany. In addition, the conference passed a resolution calling for "Britain's economy to no longer be dependent on the United States."

The Fire Brigades Union, with over 20,000 members, held its annual conference in Rhyl, North Wales, where it passed a resolution by an overwhelming majority supporting the demand for a five-power conference and recognition of the People's Republic of China's right to participate in the United Nations. Another resolution advocated that Britain should no longer be economically dependent on the United States.

The Boilermakers' Society, with 83,000 members, also passed the same resolution at its annual conference in Eastbourne.

    法、意和平组织号召发展和平运动
    英国许多群众团体要求五大国举行会议
    【新华社十六日讯】据塔斯社巴黎十三日讯：动员一切人民力量来争取和平的运动，在法国正在越来越壮大。
    这个运动是由法国全国和平理事会发起的。订于六月二十七日和二十八日在巴黎召开的争取和平谈判全国会议的会期一天天临近，参加这个运动的人民群众也就越来越多。
    在城市和乡村，在工厂车间和家庭住宅，千百个和平战士在分发“和平手册”，这个手册写上了人民的要求：举行和平谈判，停止目前正在进行的各种战争。
    全国各地都在举行和平示威和集会。据“人道报”消息，在法国四十二省一共举行了一百零二次要求和平的群众集会。这些集会一致要求结束越南战争，拒绝批准波恩及巴黎战争条约，举行四国和平会议以便和平解决德国问题，并且要求法国为和平而采取必要的行动。人们还准备召开各省的和平大会。无数团体响应法国全国和平理事会的号召，表示准备参加快要来到的争取和平谈判全国会议。
    【新华社十六日讯】塔斯社罗马十五日讯：意大利全国和平理事会宣布，为配合朝鲜战争三周年和六月十五日在布达佩斯召开的世界和平理事会会议，意大利将举行一个“争取在朝鲜和全世界和平”宣传周。在这周中将举行许多大会和集会。
    意大利和平委员会发表了一个告人民书说：“这些年来，千百万意大利人和全世界所有的国家亿万人民一起为争取和平而战斗。在六月七日，千百万意大利人民表示了他们争取和平的意愿，并彻底地谴责了以为自己可以不顾全国的庄严愿望的政府和党派。人民争取和平的愿望必须受到尊重！结束冷战！取消外国在意大利的基地！必须反对组织‘欧洲防务集团’的条约，这个集团摧毁我们国家的军队，并使德国军国主义复活。结束无限制的扩军竞赛。所有真诚的爱国者团结起来，这样他们对和平的热望就能得到考虑；把朝鲜战争三周年的日子做为争取一个和平的政府和意大利繁荣的日子。”
    【新华社十五日讯】塔斯社伦敦十三日讯：拥有一万六千会员的管理人员、行政人员及技术人员联合会在克莱克顿举行大会，会上通过决议，要求大国领袖举行诚恳的会议。
    会上又通过决议：要求准许中华人民共和国加入联合国，并表示反对波恩军事协定和西德重新军国主义化。此外，会上还通过一项要求“英国经济不再依附美国”的决议。
    拥有两万余会员的消防队联合会年会在北威尔士的莱尔举行，会上以压倒多数通过决议，支持五大国举行会议及承认中华人民共和国参加联合国的权利的要求。另外一项决议主张英国应该不再在经济上依靠美国。
    拥有八万三千会员的汽锅制造者协会年会在东培恩举行，会上也通过同样的决议。
