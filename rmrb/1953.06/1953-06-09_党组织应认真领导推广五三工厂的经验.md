    Party Organizations Should Seriously Lead the Promotion of the Five-Three Factory Experience
    "When promoting the experience of the Five-Three Factory, it is necessary to understand where the benefits of the Five-Three Factory lie and to study this experience. At the same time, it is also necessary to study one's own situation and find ways to promote the experience of the Five-Three Factory. That is to say, the experience of the Five-Three Factory should be used to promote the experience of the Five-Three Factory. That is, when promoting this experience, it is necessary to first organize learning, with Party, government, labor union, and youth league cadres studying first to achieve consensus in thinking; then find ways to promote it. Only in this way can the smooth promotion of this experience be guaranteed." (Lai Ruoyu: "How to Promote and Implement the Experience of the Five-Three Factory")
    Therefore, when studying and promoting the experience of the Five-Three Factory, the factory's Party organization must organize learning, lead Party, government, labor union, and youth league cadres to study first, and strengthen the Party's political and ideological leadership to ensure consistency in thought and action. Wei Wenfeng, Secretary of the Party Committee of the Shenyang Smelting Plant, in his article "How We Learn and Apply the Experience of the Five-Three Factory" (May 8th, this newspaper, page 3), used facts to answer the above question. The Shenyang Smelting Plant began studying the experience of the Five-Three Factory as early as July 1951. At that time, due to the Party Committee's insufficient understanding of this work, the study process only involved a few general discussions, without any practical and serious inspection and improvement of work. Later, the Party Committee of the plant changed its past incorrect understanding, actively organized Party, administrative, labor union, and youth league cadres to conduct systematic learning. In the study, they linked thinking, examined work, and gradually applied the experience of the Five-Three Factory to practical work, achieving good results. For two years, the Shenyang Smelting Plant has consistently completed the state's production plans month by month, quarter by quarter, and year by year. Other factories and mines, such as the Beijing 546 Factory, Taiyuan Machine Factory, Chongqing 610 Cotton Mill, and the Ping'an Drilling Team of the Fuxin Mining Bureau, have had similar experiences. Facts prove that where the Party organization attaches importance to and strengthens leadership in this area, enterprise management is constantly advancing; conversely, where the Party organization relaxes or abandons leadership in this area, progress is slow, or even abandoned halfway.
    Currently, judging from the situation of learning and promoting the experience of the Five-Three Factory in various places, many factories and mines lack even a basic understanding of the experience of the Five-Three Factory and abandon the Party's responsibility for ideological and political leadership, resulting in slow progress and numerous obstacles. First, it is manifested in the complacent mentality of the leadership of some factory and mine Party committees. They doubt "whether the experience of the Five-Three Factory is as good as promoted," saying "the experience of the Five-Three Factory was summarized for them by higher authorities. If the higher authorities summarized it for us, we would also have a set of experiences," and some believe that "if the higher authorities gave me so much funding and such strong cadres, I would do better than the Five-Three Factory." Under the control of this arrogant and complacent mentality, some simply refuse to promote the experience of the Five-Three Factory. Others use the excuse that objective conditions are not as good as others, such as saying "they are factories, we are mines," "their factory is big, with a lot of funds, our factory is small, with little funds," "they have many cadres, we have few cadres," and so on. Thus, they draw the erroneous conclusion that "conditions are different, and it is impossible to learn." It should be admitted that the specific conditions of each factory and mine are different, but the basic conditions are the same. For example, every factory or mine, like the Five-Three Factory, has Party, administrative, labor union, and youth league organizations, so they should compare themselves with the Five-Three Factory and see how to strengthen political and ideological leadership to make the thinking of the factory's Party, government, labor union, and youth league cadres consistent, their steps consistent, their division of labor clear, and their cooperation with each other, so that they can jointly complete the state's production plans from different positions. For example, the Party work of the Five-Three Factory combines political work with economic work to realize the Party's guarantee and supervision of production, which can also be compared with how our factory's Party organization is realizing the guarantee and supervision of production. Facts prove that the experience of the Five-Three Factory is a yardstick for testing leadership work. As long as we refer to the experience of the Five-Three Factory, humbly examine our own work, promote achievements, and overcome shortcomings, then our work will continue to advance. Of course, there are still areas in the experience of the Five-Three Factory that deserve enrichment and development. If some factories and mines have indeed discovered better experiences than the Five-Three Factory, then they should enrich it and make it more complete and systematic.
    In the process of learning and promoting the experience of the Five-Three Factory, the Party committees of some factories and mines regard this work as the affair of the labor union or other departments and do not pay attention to it. For example, the work of the Northeast Electric Engineering Tenth Factory to promote the experience of the Five-Three Factory is organized and led solely by the factory's labor union's cultural and educational department. The Fushun Steel Plant passed this work on to the Youth League to be responsible for. Reports on the work of labor unions in various places also reflect that the promotion of the Five-Three Factory experience in many factories and mines is carried out by the labor union in isolation. Because the labor unions in these factories have failed to receive the leadership of the Party, the result of the study is either abandoned halfway or stagnates. They do not understand that the experience of the Five-Three Factory is a complete set of relatively complete experiences, which not only contains the specific work experience of each department of the Party, government, labor union, and youth league, but also concentrates on embodying the work line of combining leadership with the masses, combining political work with economic work, and combining the development of production with the improvement of the lives of employees. Therefore, it is an organic collection of comprehensive experiences, an indivisible whole. Any department, if it promotes such and such experience in isolation from the leadership of the Party, is impossible to succeed and directly violates the basic spirit of the Five-Three Factory experience.
    The last type of work spirit that does not conform to the Five-Three Factory is that the Party committees of some factories and mines oppose learning from the experience of the Five-Three Factory and the central work. On the one hand, they acknowledge the superiority of the Five-Three Factory experience and express their willingness to learn and promote this experience. However, when it comes to concrete implementation, they often emphasize "busy work" and "little time" and do not participate in learning. The Northeast Machinery First Factory, Tangshan Knitting Factory, and Xuanhua Winery have all experienced such situations. The Party committees of these factories and mines do not regard learning from the experience of the Five-Three Factory as the only correct way to improve work in the implementation of the central work, but as a "heavy burden," complaining that "they are busy all day long and have added learning from the experience of the Five-Three Factory." Thus, they draw an erroneous conclusion: "To be busy with production, we cannot promote the experience of the Five-Three Factory; to promote the experience of the Five-Three Factory, we cannot complete the production tasks." The Third Mine of Yangquan Coal Mine in Shanxi interrupted the work of promoting the experience of the Five-Three Factory under this excuse. This understanding of opposing learning and promoting the experience of the Five-Three Factory with the current production work is very wrong. They do not understand that learning and promoting the experience of the Five-Three Factory is the best way for industrial cadres to learn the art of modern enterprise leadership, overcome the phenomenon of being busy and chaotic, and establish a normal order of grass-roots work. The Party branch of Nanjing Radio Factory combined learning from the experience of the Five-Three Factory with the struggle against bureaucracy, which not only thoroughly exposed the shortcomings in the work, but also quickly implemented the experience of the Five-Three Factory into the current work, giving the whole factory a new look. Others, such as Handan State-owned Cotton Mill No. 1 and Wuhan Fifth Power Plant, have achieved good results by learning and promoting the experience of the Five-Three Factory in the process of discussing production plans and carrying out labor competitions by combining it with the central work.
    In short, seriously learning and promoting the experience of the Five-Three Factory is the way for the leadership departments of factories and mines across the country to effectively improve leadership methods and do a good job in enterprise management. In order to make this learning achieve the due results, local Party committees and factory and mine Party organizations must strengthen the leadership of this work, must truly understand the spiritual essence of the Five-Three Factory experience, and use the leadership methods of the Five-Three Factory to promote the Five-Three Factory experience. Any arrogance and complacency, abandoning leadership, must be criticized and corrected.

### 党组织应认真领导推广五三工厂的经验

    党组织应认真领导推广五三工厂的经验
    “推广五三工厂的经验时，必须了解五三工厂的好处在那里，并且要对这个经验加以研究。同时也必须研究自己的情况，找出推广五三工厂经验的办法。这就是说，应该用五三工厂的经验来推广五三工厂的经验。即推广这一经验时，先要组织学习，党、政、工、团干部首先研究，在思想上取得一致；然后找出推广的办法。只有这样，才能保证这一经验顺利地推广。”（赖若愚：“怎样推广和贯彻五三工厂的经验”）
    因此，在学习和推广五三工厂的经验时，工厂的党组织必须组织学习，领导党、政、工、团的干部首先研究，加强党的政治思想领导，以保证思想行动的一致。中共沈阳冶炼厂党委书记魏文风，在他所写的“我们怎样学习和运用五三工厂的经验”（五月八日本报三版）一文中，用事实回答了以上这个问题。沈阳冶炼厂，从一九五一年七月便开始学习五三工厂的经验。当时由于该厂党委对这一工作认识不足，所以在学习过程中，只泛泛地进行了几次讨论，没有切实认真地检查和改进工作。后来，该厂党委转变了过去的不正确认识，积极地组织党、行政、工会和青年团的干部，进行了有系统的学习。在学习中，联系思想、检查工作，逐步把五三工厂的经验运用到实际工作中去，收到了良好的效果。沈阳冶炼厂二年以来，一直是逐月、逐季、逐年地完成国家生产计划。其他各厂矿，如北京五四六工厂，太原机器厂，重庆六一零纱厂，阜新矿务局平安钻探队等，都有类似的体验。事实证明：那里的党组织重视和加强了对这一方面的领导，那里的企业管理就不断前进；相反，那里的党组织放松或放弃了对这一方面的领导，那里便进展迟缓，甚至半途而废。
    目前从各地学习和推广五三工厂经验的情况来看，有不少的厂矿由于缺乏对五三工厂经验起码的了解，放弃党对思想政治领导的职责，因而很多工作进展迟缓，障碍重重。首先表现在某些厂矿党委的领导思想上存在着自满情绪。他们怀疑“五三工厂的经验是不是像宣传的那样好”，说“五三工厂的经验是上级替他们总结出来的。如果上级替我们总结一下，也有一套经验”，有人认为“如果上级给我那么多的资金，那么强的干部，我比五三工厂搞的更好”。在这种骄傲自满情绪的支配下，有的根本拒绝推广五三工厂的经验。有的则藉口客观条件不如人家，如说“人家是工厂，我们是矿山”，“人家的厂子大，资金多，我们的厂子小，资金少”，
    “人家的干部多，我们的干部少”等等。因而得出了一个错误的结论是“条件不同，无法学习”。应该承认：各厂矿的具体情况是有差别的，但是基本情况还是相同的。比如：每个工厂或矿山，和五三工厂一样，都有党、行政、工会和青年团的组织，那么就应该和五三工厂对照一下，如何通过加强政治思想领导，使工厂的党、政、工、团干部的思想一致，步调一致，分工负责，互相配合，从不同的岗位上去共同完成国家的生产计划的。又如，五三工厂党的工作是把政治工作和经济工作结合起来，以实现党对生产的保证和监督作用的，这也不妨对照
    一下，我们厂的党组织究竟是怎样实现对生产的保证和监督作用的。事实证明：五三工厂经验是检验领导工作的标尺，只要我们参照五三工厂的经验，虚心地检查一下自己的工作，发扬成绩，克服缺点，那末我们的工作就会不断地前进。当然，五三工厂的经验还有值得充实和发展的地方。假如有些厂矿确实发现了比五三工厂更好的经验，那么就应该充实进去，使它更加完备和系统。
    在学习和推广五三工厂经验的过程中，某些厂矿的党委把这一工作当作工会或其他部门的事，不闻不问。比如：东北电工十厂推广五三工厂经验的工作，便是由该厂工会文教部单独组织领导的。抚顺制钢厂就把这一工作推给了青年团去负责。各地工会工作的报告中也反映了许多厂矿的推广五三工厂经验，都是由工会孤立地进行的。由于这些工厂的工会未能得到党的领导，学习的结果，不是半途而废，便是停滞不前。他们不懂五三工厂的经验是一整套比较完备的经验，它不仅包含了党、政、工、团每一个部门的具体的工作经验，而且它又集中地体现了领导和群众相结合，政治工作和经济工作相结合，发展生产和改善职工生活相结合的工作路线。因此说，它是全面经验的有机的总汇，是一个不可分割的整体。任何一个部门，如果离开党的领导，孤立地去推广这样那样的经验，都是不可能成功的。而且是直接违反了五三工厂经验的基本精神的。
    最后一种不合乎五三工厂的工作精神的就是有些厂矿党委，把学习五三工厂经验和中心工作对立起来。他们一方面承认五三工厂经验的优越性，并表示愿意学习和推广这一经验。但是，到了具体实行的时候，却又往往强调“工作忙”，“时间少”，不去参加学习。东北机械一厂，唐山针织厂，宣化酒厂，都曾发生过这样的情况。这些厂矿的党委没有把学习五三工厂的经验，看成是在贯彻中心工作中改进工作的唯一正确的方法，而是看成一种“沉重的负担”，埋怨说：“整天忙的要死，又加了一个学习五三工厂经验。”于是便得出一个错误的结论：“要忙生产、便不能推广五三工厂经验，要推广五三工厂经验，便不能完成生产任务。”山西阳泉煤矿第三矿，便在这种藉口下，将推广五三工厂经验的工作中断下来。这种把学习和推广五三工厂经验与当前生产工作对立起来的认识，是十分错误的。他们不了解学习和推广五三工厂经验，正是使工业干部学习现代化企业领导艺术，克服忙乱现象，建立基层工作正常秩序的最好方法。南京有线电厂党支部，把学习五三工厂经验和反官僚主义的斗争结合起来，不仅彻底揭发了工作中的缺点，而且很快把五三工厂的经验贯彻到了当前的工作中去，使全厂出现了新面貌。其他如邯郸国棉一厂，武汉第五发电厂等，在讨论生产计划和开展劳动竞赛的过程中，由于结合中心工作学习推广五三工厂经验，获得了很好的效果。
    总之，认真学习和推广五三工厂经验，是全国厂矿领导部门切实改进领导方法，做好企业管理的门径。为使这一学习获得应有的成效，各地方党委和厂矿党组织必须加强对这一工作的领导，要切实领会五三工厂经验的精神实质，用五三工厂的领导方法来推广五三工厂经验，任何骄傲自满、放弃领导的作法，都必须予以批判和纠正。
