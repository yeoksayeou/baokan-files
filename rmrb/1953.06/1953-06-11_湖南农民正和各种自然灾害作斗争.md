Hunan peasants had basically finished rice transplanting work by the end of May, and most areas began summer weeding, grass pulling, and topdressing. Except for a few areas that suffered losses from flooding, the rice seedlings generally grew well. Cotton fields have also been planted, and those planted earlier have begun their first hoeing. The current focus of rural work in Hunan is flood prevention (mainly in the lake areas), drought prevention, pest control, and famine prevention. The counties around the lake are currently making every effort to strengthen the inspection of dikes and embankments and prepare for flood prevention. Flood control command organizations at all levels have been established in various places, and most areas have also organized inspection teams to check whether the dike body is strong enough and whether the equipment and rations prepared are sufficient. Mountainous and hilly areas are currently stepping up preparations for drought prevention, strengthening water storage, water management, and rational water use, and conducting major inspections of ponds and dams.

This spring, Hunan has achieved a lot in leading the masses to overcome natural disasters. When insect pests were found in the rice paddies, pest control work was immediately stepped up, greatly reducing the insect damage. After transplanting, locust nymphs emerged in large numbers in some areas, and the Rural Work Department of the Hunan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China instructed all localities to promptly organize and mobilize the masses to swat them to prevent them from spreading. In early May, the Changde Special District established a locust control command, and successively established locust control commands at the county, district, and township levels, mobilizing the masses to kill locust nymphs and dig up locust eggs. Now the special district has organized a locust control inspection team, and the counties have also formed inspection teams, putting forward locust control slogans such as "Extinguishing locusts is like extinguishing fire" and "Protecting seedlings is like protecting life," mobilizing the masses to catch locusts. The lake areas have been working hard on drainage, and Hanshou proposed "Drain one field, transplant one field" during transplanting. After rain, various places have also continuously led the masses to carry out drainage, and there are not many waterlogged fields at present. (Deng Guanggao)

    湖南农民正和各种自然灾害作斗争
    湖南全省插秧工作到五月底已基本结束，大部地区开始进行夏耘、扯草、追肥。除少数地区遭受水灾损失外，稻苗一般生长良好。棉田也已种完，播种早的已开始锄头遍苗。当前湖南农村工作的中心是防汛（主要是湖区）、防旱、除虫、防荒。滨湖各县目前正全力加强堤垸检查和防汛准备工作。各地各级防汛指挥机构都已建立，大部分地区并组织了检查组，分头检查堤身是否坚固，器材、口粮准备是否够用。山区、丘陵区各地目前正加紧准备防旱，加强蓄水、管水和合理用水工作，进行塘埧大检查。
    湖南各地今春在领导群众战胜自然灾害方面已做出不少成绩。秧田发现虫害时，立即抓紧了治虫工作，使虫害大大减轻。插秧后部分地区蝗蝻大量出土，中共湖南省委农村工作部指示各地及时组织和发动群众扑打，不使蔓延扩大。常德专区于五月初间即成立治蝗指挥部，并相继成立县、区、乡各级治蝗指挥部，发动群众扑杀蝗蝻、挖掘蝗卵。现在该专区又组织了治蝗检查团，各县也多组成了检查组，提出“灭蝗如灭火”“保苗如保命”等治蝗口号，动员群众捕蝗。湖区各地对于排渍工作抓得很紧，汉寿在插秧中即提出“排一丘插一丘”；雨后各地亦不断领导群众进行排渍，目前受渍的田已经不多。（邓光诰）
