    Cadre Zhou Qingfang Discovers the Knack for Leading Work
    Zhou Zhiqing
    Recently, in the Nanpinggu Village area of Ding County's Second District, Hebei Province, peasants have been spreading good news: the useless Ma Pao Spring is also irrigating the fields along newly opened channels. As ninety carrying poles rise and fall along the newly opened channels to irrigate the fields, people are saying, "This is Zhou Qingfang's doing, a blessing for us farmers!"
    Zhou Qingfang is the Secretary of the Ding County Second District Party Committee. In this anti-bureaucracy struggle, he is one of the many cadres who has discovered the knack for leading work. In leading production, he had previously encountered setbacks and been stymied by difficulties. That was last October when, shortly after being transferred from the Ding County Party Committee to the Second District, he began to lead the masses in "Sanqiu" (autumn plowing, autumn sowing, and autumn harvesting) work. Zhou Qingfang ran around busily all day, exhausted, but the masses complained, "The district cadres have arrived, simply making trouble for us." Zhou Qingfang wondered: Leading production is clearly a good thing, so why don't the peasants support it? To clarify this issue, he asked the peasants and found the answer: the leadership was divorced from the masses and divorced from reality. Some villages had mostly dry land, but cadres insisted that Party members take the lead in completing "wheat sowing tasks," resulting in the "tasks" being completed in two or three days, but the figures were false. Most farmers in this area raised small donkeys, but the cadres, disregarding the actual situation, forcibly promoted more than one hundred walking plows. As a result, the donkeys couldn't pull them, and the walking plows became "hanging plows." All this made him realize that what the masses meant by "production doesn't need leadership" was actually that they didn't need this kind of bureaucratic leadership. So, he deeply examined himself and finally resolved to resolutely rely on the masses, overcome bureaucracy, and lead agricultural production well.
    This March, when the district committee was deploying production according to instructions from the county committee, the usual practice was to immediately summon the village cadres, make the arrangements, and be done with it. However, this time Zhou Qingfang changed this working method. He first mobilized all the district cadres to go to the villages to get to the "bottom" of things and understand the masses' drought prevention experience. Zhou Qingfang himself went deep into the area near Ma Pao Spring and held discussions with the peasants to see if it was possible to use the spring water to open channels for irrigation. The answer he got was, "It can be irrigated, but it's a lot of effort." Later, at the village cadre meeting, Zhou Qingfang raised this matter for discussion. Bian Shuntang, the Secretary of the Dingling Village Party Branch, said, "The masses will definitely support this. Our village alone can irrigate more than a thousand mu, and even Erlangmiao, Nanpinggu, and Liangjiaying can irrigate several thousand mu." Fan Guoming, the Secretary of the Erlangmiao Village Party Branch, said, "This area used to be a region of floods nine years out of ten. To the north, we have the Mengliang River, and to the south, there's Ma Pao Spring, constantly bubbling with water. In recent years, people have dug small ditches along the edges of their fields, leaving them to drain water. Now, if we open a channel along the small ditches at the edges of the fields, it won't damage the land much, and even if there's flooding, it can drain into the Mengliang River." Zhou Qingfang further asked everyone: why hadn't this spring water been used for irrigation in previous years? Everyone said it was because they were afraid of the trouble. In the past, because one family or one village would try to open it, they couldn't, and if too many people opened it, it would lead to grabbing water and disputes. After everyone's discussion, it was decided to open a channel for drought prevention.
    Soon, a surveying team from Hebei Province came to measure the water conservancy and confirmed that the water volume of the existing spring could irrigate several thousand mu of farmland. Zhou Qingfang was still worried about insufficient water and discussed solutions with five farmers from Erlangmiao, including Du Laogao and Du Laoqing. All five suggested that the several wells near "Old Mud Nest" would find water after digging only three feet deep. Zhou Qingfang, together with Zhang Fuhai, the Deputy Secretary of the District Committee, and some village cadres, personally inspected the "Old Mud Nest." Finally, after research and discussion by the Second District Party Committee, it was decided to mobilize Party members in the villages near the spring to lead the masses in opening a channel.
    When digging the channel began, some of the masses were unsure, fearing that they wouldn't be able to irrigate the land and it would cause disunity, fearing that people wouldn't be of one mind. After an agreement between Nanpinggu and other villages, the cadres unanimously stated that they would guarantee the implementation of the agreement, protect the sluice gates, and use the water on time, and would never exceed the time limit. Only then were the farmers reassured. Influenced by the exemplary actions of the Party members and cadres, more than 1,500 farmers dug a channel five li long, more than three chi deep, and two or three chi wide in one day. At this time, Zhou Qingfang proposed to the Party branches of the relevant villages: through irrigation, this is a test of whether the Party members have selfishness and localism. After the channel was dug, more than 700 farmers from the relevant villages were mobilized to dredge it in sections. Zhou Qingfang also used the example of Bian Fushun, a farmer from Dingling Village, who opened the sluice gate to irrigate his own one mu of land, damaging the irrigation of 900 mu of land in other villages, to deeply criticize the selfishness and conservatism of some farmers at a general meeting of beneficiary farmers in the district, and demanded that everyone use the water reasonably and act in accordance with the agreement. After this series of work, many masses reported that under the leadership of the Communist Party, there is really nothing that cannot be done.
    A good thing that Zhou Qingfang did for the masses according to their needs was finally initially accomplished. Dingling Village and Erlangmiao Village irrigated more than 2,700 mu of land in four days. Nanpinggu also irrigated more than 1,300 mu of land in five days. When Grandma Xue Yuan from Nanpinggu Village saw that her seven mu of land had just been irrigated, she happily said, "This piece of land has been dead and dry for more than fifty years! This has become a garden (i.e., a paddy field), and I won't rely on the heavens anymore." Many village cadres also said: Not many meetings were held to open the channel, and not many statistics were taken. It was done after some consultation. Secretary Zhou of the district committee is really capable! However, Zhou Qingfang was not complacent because of his achievements. He still instructed the management committee to organize technicians to find new spring sources to ensure a more sufficient supply of water.

    摸到领导工作窍门的干部——周清芳
    周志清
    最近河北省定县二区南平谷村一带，农民传说着一件喜事——没用的马刨泉也顺着新开的渠道浇地了。九十个挑竿沿着新开的渠道一上一下浇地时，人们都说：“这是周清芳的功劳，咱庄稼人的福气呀！”
    周清芳是中共定县二区区委书记，在这次反官僚主义斗争中，他是摸到领导工作窍门的很多干部中的一个。在领导生产上，他曾碰过钉子，被困难难住过。那是去年十月，他刚从中共定县县委会调到二区工作不久，就着手领导群众进行“三秋”（秋耕、秋种、秋收）工作。周清芳成天东奔西走，累得要死，可是群众却反映说：“区干部来了，简直就是给人们找麻烦。”周清芳想：领导生产明明是好事，为什么农民不赞成呢？为弄清这问题，他去问农民，结果找到了答案：就是领导脱离了群众，脱离了实际。有的村旱地多，也硬叫党员带头完成种麦“任务”，结果两三天就完成了“任务”，但数目字是假的。这一带农民多是喂的小驴子，但干部不根据实际情况，硬推广了一百多张步犁，结果，驴子拉不动，步犁变成“挂犁”。这一切，使他认识到群众所说的“生产不用领导”，实际上是不需要这种官僚主义的领导。于是他深刻地检查了自己，最后下定决心：坚决依靠群众，克服官僚主义，把农业生产领导好。
    今年三月间，区委根据县委的指示布置生产时，按以往的惯例，是立即把村干部召集来往下一布置就完事，可是周清芳这次转变了这种工作方法，他首先发动全体区干部到村向群众摸“底”，了解群众防旱经验。周清芳本人也深入到马刨泉附近，和农民座谈，看能不能利用泉水开渠浇地。得到的回答是：“浇地能浇，就是费劲。”后来在村干会议上，周清芳提出了这件事让大家讨论，中共叮咛村支部书记边顺堂说：“这事群众一定拥护，光俺村就能浇一千多亩，连二郎庙、南平谷、梁家营都能浇几千亩。”中共二郎庙村支部书记范国明说：“以前这里是十年九涝的地区，北边守着孟良河，南边有个马刨泉，常年往外冒水。这些年人们地边上都挖了小沟，这就是留下泄水的。现在要开渠，顺着地边上的小沟，地也伤不了什么，就是发了水，也能泄到孟良河去。”周清芳又问大家：前几年为什么不使这个泉水浇地？大家说是怕麻烦。过去，因为一家一村去开，开不了，开的人多了，就形成抢水，而且会发生纠纷。经过大家讨论，决定开渠防旱。
    不久，河北省测量队来测量水利，肯定了现有泉水的水量，能浇几千亩耕地。周清芳还怕水量不足，又找二郎庙的农民杜老高、杜老庆等五人研究办法，他五人都提出：“老泥窝”附近几个井，都是挖三尺多深就见了水。周清芳又和区委会副书记张福海及一些村干部亲自到“老泥窝”做了检查。最后经过中共二区区委会研究讨论，决定发动泉水附近各村党员带动群众开渠。
    开始挖渠道时，有些群众不摸底，怕浇不了地惹的大家不团结，怕人多心不齐。经过南平谷等村庄的协议后，干部一致表示，保证执行协议，保护闸口，按期使水，绝不超过期限。农民们这才放了心。在党员干部的模范行动影响下，一千五百多个农民一天就掘成了长五里、深三尺多、宽二三尺的
    一条渠道，这时，周清芳又向有关村庄的党支部提出：通过浇地，这是对党员们有无自私、本位思想的考验。挖好渠以后，又发动有关村庄七百多农民，分段进行了疏通。周清芳又在全区受益农户大会上，用叮咛村农民边福顺为浇自己一亩地将闸口打开，破坏了其他村庄九百亩地浇水的事例，深刻地批判了部分农民的自私保守思想，要求大家要合理使水，按协议办事。经过这一系列的工作，许多群众都反映：在共产党领导下，真是没有办不了的事情。
    周清芳根据群众的需要给群众办的一件好事终于初步办成了。叮咛村和二郎庙村四天浇了二千七百多亩地。南平谷五天也浇地一千三百多亩。南平谷村薛元老太太看见自己的七亩地刚浇完的时候，高兴地说：“这块地五十多年了，净是死旱地呀！这?成了园地（即水田），俺以后再不盼老天爷了。”好多村干部也说：开渠开的会并不多，也没怎么统计数字，商商量量就办了，周区委真行啊！可是周清芳并不因为获得了成绩而自满，他仍然指导管理委员会组织技术人员寻找新的泉源，以保证水源的更充足的供应。
