Xinhua News Agency, London, June 18th (TASS): Cultural and scientific groups dedicated to seeking peace convened a conference in London, attended by more than 1,200 people.

Speakers at the meeting included: Cecil Day-Lewis, Professor of Poetry at Oxford University, who spoke on behalf of the "Writers Association for World Peace"; Professor F.G. Gregory, who spoke on behalf of the "Scientists Committee for Peace"; Dr. Horace Joules, who spoke on behalf of the "Medical Association for the Prevention of War"; pianist and composer Frank Merrick, who spoke on behalf of the "Musicians Association for Peace"; art teacher and critic John Berger, who spoke on behalf of the "Artists Association for Peace"; Douglas Beales, a member of the Royal Institute of British Architects, who spoke on behalf of the "Architects Association for Peace and Reconstruction"; and Master of Science Margaret Davies, who spoke on behalf of the "Teachers Committee for Peace."

The chairman of the conference was Canon Harman, pastor of South Marston (Wiltshire), and a representative of the British delegation to the World People's Peace Conference held in Vienna.

Professor Lewis called for a response to the Soviet Union's peace proposals and urged strong, constant pressure on politicians to consolidate their position in negotiations seeking a peaceful resolution to disputes.

Dr. Horace Joules spoke of how the United States restricts trade, preventing the shipment of drugs such as streptomycin, which can cure tuberculosis, to China. His remarks drew cries of "shameful" from the audience.

Joules spoke of the tremendous progress in health he had seen during his recent visit to China. He pointed out with deep emotion that medical professionals and the general public in Western countries should not stand idly by while the United States inflicts terrible suffering on innocent people in Korea with napalm bombs.

John Berger suggested that the World Peace Council hold an international peace competition for artists, with British art students and young artists from the Soviet Union and various People's Democracies visiting each other, and an exhibition of Soviet art in London's National Gallery. The participants greeted the final suggestion with enthusiastic applause.

Douglas Beales protested against the reduction of construction costs for the sake of rearmament. He said: Look to the East and you will see large-scale peaceful construction, in sharp contrast to the West's preparation for war!

The conference unanimously passed a resolution in favor of holding a top-level meeting of major powers as soon as possible.

    英国科学和文化团体在伦敦召开和平大会
    一致通过决议要求大国早日举行最高级会议
    【新华社二十日讯】塔斯社伦敦十八日讯：致力谋求和平的文化和科学团体在伦敦召集了一个大会，到会的有一千二百多人。
    在会上演说的有：牛津大学诗学教授塞西尔·德·刘易斯，他代表“作家争取世界和平协会”发言；弗·格·格里戈里教授，他代表“科学家争取和平委员会”发言；霍雷斯·裘尔斯博士，他代表“医学界防止战争协会”发言；钢琴家和作曲家弗兰克·麦里克，他代表“音乐家争取和平协会”发言；艺术教师和评论家约翰·伯格尔，他代表“艺术家争取和平协会”发言；英国皇家建筑家协会会员道格拉斯·贝莱，他代表“建筑家争取和平与复兴协会”发言；科学硕士玛格丽特·戴维斯，她代表“教师争取和平委员会”发言。
    大会主席是英国出席在维也纳举行的世界人民和平大会代表团代表、南马斯登（尉尔特郡）牧师坎农·哈尔曼。
    刘易斯教授要求答复苏联的和平建议，并敦促对政治家施用强大的、不断的压力，以巩固他们在谋求和平解决争端的谈判中的立场。
    霍雷斯·裘尔斯博士说到美国如何限制贸易，阻止把能治肺结核的链霉素这一类的药品运往中国。他谈到这件事时引起会场上的人高呼“可耻”。
    裘尔斯谈到他在最近访问中国时所看到的卫生方面的巨大进步。他怀着深挚的感情指出，西方国家的医学界人士和一般人不应该眼看美国用凝固汽油弹使朝鲜无辜人民遭到可怕的折磨而漠不关心。
    约翰·伯格尔建议由世界和平理事会举办艺术家的国际和平竞赛，英国艺术学生和苏联以及各人民民主国家的青年艺术家互相访问，在伦敦国家陈列馆展览苏联的艺术作品。与会者对于最后的建议报以热烈的掌声。
    道格拉斯·贝莱抗议为了重整军备而削减建设费用。他说：大家向东方看一看，就会看见大规模的和平建设，与西方备战的情况恰成鲜明的对比！
    大会一致通过决议，赞成大国早日举行最高级会议。
