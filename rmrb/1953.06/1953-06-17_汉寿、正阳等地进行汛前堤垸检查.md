    Hanshou, Zhengyang and Other Places Conduct Pre-Flood Embankment Inspections
    The Fifth District of Hanshou County, Hunan Province, and the Huai River Control Headquarters of Zhengyang County, Henan Province, conducted pre-flood embankment inspections and discovered many problems, and are mobilizing the masses to solve them.
    In late May, the Fifth District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Hanshou organized four inspection teams composed of more than 60 people, including district, township, and embankment cadres and experienced farmers, to conduct an in-depth inspection of the flood prevention preparations of the Baohe, Wenwei, and Taihe embankments. The inspection revealed the following problems: First, there were many obstacles and hidden dangers in the embankment body. A total of 103 leaks were found in the three embankments. There were more than 120 graves on the dangerous embankment of Taihe Embankment, and a new grave had a large hole of more than 20 cubic meters dug into the embankment body. In Baohe Embankment, there were eight badger holes in a 60-meter section of the embankment, and the embankment body had been hollowed out. In addition, farmers had dug many vegetable gardens and tree holes on the embankment. Second, the flood prevention equipment was not sufficiently prepared, and the equipment stations were not located appropriately. Third, some embankment sections experienced collapses and leaks this spring due to the poor quality of the construction.
    On the 25th, the district held an emergency flood prevention meeting and formulated flood prevention plans for each embankment based on the problems found. For example, Taihe Embankment decided to mobilize 2,200 laborers by the end of May to transport 2,200 cubic meters of "Taiping soil" (soil used for flood control). Adequate wave-blocking equipment should be prepared and appropriately concentrated in the 16 stations throughout the embankment. Each district committee was specifically assigned tasks and contracted to take responsibility for the embankments. After the meeting, each embankment immediately began to take action. By the 28th, Baohe Embankment had completed more than 200 cubic meters over its planned 1,200 cubic meters of Taiping soil. In Taihe Embankment, in addition to retaining more than 900 laborers to weed and top-dress in the fields, more than 1,000 people were concentrated to transport Taiping soil, and more than 500 cubic meters had been transported. Most of the wave-blocking equipment has been concentrated at the stations.
    On May 26, the Zhengyang Huai River Control Headquarters organized two inspection teams to conduct a major pre-flood safety inspection of the Ruhan River Second Section and other embankment lines, as well as eleven sluice gates such as Yuwan Lake. These embankment sections had been subjected to high water levels during last year's flood season, but had not been repaired after the flood season. This inspection found 13 large and small dangerous embankment sections, and 140 mu of river滩 (river beach) overgrown with reeds, blocking the discharge of river water. Now, the county headquarters has formulated a pre-flood embankment reinforcement and repair plan, preparing to mobilize 4,500 laborers to complete more than 91,000 cubic meters of earthwork.

    汉寿、正阳等地进行汛前堤垸检查
    湖南汉寿县五区、河南正阳县治淮总队部进行汛前堤垸检查，发现问题很多，正发动群众解决。
    中共汉寿五区区委在五月下旬组织了包括区、乡、垸干部和老农共六十余人的四个检查组，对保和、文蔚、太和三垸的防汛准备工作进行了一次深入的检查。检查中发现了以下问题：一、堤身障碍物和隐患很多。三垸共检查出渗漏一百零三处。太和垸险堤有坟穴一百二十多处，有一座新坟穴将堤身挖了有二十多方土的大洞。保叔垸在六十公尺长的一段堤内有八个獾洞，堤身已被钻空。此外，农民还在堤上挖了很多菜园和树洞。二、防汛器材准备不充足，器材站不适中。三、部分堤段因工程质量粗糙，今春发生崩塌漏水现象。
    二十五日，区里召开了防汛紧急会议，根据所发现的问题订出各垸防汛计划。如太和垸决定在五月底动员民工二千二百人，挑足太平土二千二百方。筹备充足挡浪器材，适当集中在全垸十六个站内。各区委具体分工，包干下垸。会后各垸立即开始行动，到二十八日止，保和垸计划的一千二百方太平土已超过二百多方完成。太和垸各乡除留九百多个劳动力在田间除草追肥外，集中一千余人挑太平土，已挑了五百多方。挡浪器材已大部集中到站。
    正阳治淮总队部在五月二十六日组织了两个检查组，分赴汝河二段等堤线及余湾湖等十一座水闸进行汛前堤防安全大检查。这些堤段在去年汛期曾受过较高水位的冲袭和考验，但汛期过后未加修补。这次检查中发现大小险堤工段十三处，河滩芦苇丛生阻止河水下泄的地域有一百四十余亩。现在县总队部已订出汛期前堤防加固补修计划，准备动员民工四千五百人，完成土方九万一千余公方。
