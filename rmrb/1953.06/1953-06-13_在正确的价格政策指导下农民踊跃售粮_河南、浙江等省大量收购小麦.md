Xinhua News Agency Report:

    Under the Guidance of Correct Price Policies, Farmers Enthusiastically Sell Grain
    Henan, Zhejiang, and Other Provinces Purchase Large Quantities of Wheat
    According to Xinhua News Agency: The purchase of new wheat has begun in all provinces of Central and Southern China. On June 2nd, the Grain Bureau of the Central and Southern Administrative Council instructed state-owned grain companies and cooperatives in all wheat-producing areas to cater to the needs of the masses, set up more purchasing points, and maintain reasonable market prices so that farmers would not suffer losses. Purchasing points should also be established in areas with inconvenient transportation to solve the difficulties of farmers selling wheat. While purchasing, farmers should be given as much convenience as possible to buy rice and coarse grains. At the same time, local commercial departments should be consulted to vigorously supply farmers with essential living and production materials. The instructions also required grain departments in various provinces to organize roving inspection teams to supervise and inspect the purchasing work and effectively help grassroots purchasing units solve practical difficulties.
    The Henan Provincial Cooperative Union has comprehensively launched its purchasing work. This year, the wheat purchased by cooperatives in Henan Province on behalf of state-owned grain companies accounts for 65 percent of the province's annual grain company purchase plan, an increase of 42.6 percent over the amount of wheat purchased by cooperatives last year. In the main wheat-producing areas of the province, cooperatives and state-owned grain companies have established joint offices. Both parties have also decided to regularly assign cadres to organize inspection teams to conduct inspections at grassroots purchasing points. At present, more than 1,300 wheat purchasing points set up by cooperatives and state-owned grain companies in various medium and small towns throughout the province have generally started purchasing. In Huangchuan, Guangshan, Gushi, Luoshan, and other counties where wheat was marketed earlier, the wheat purchased by cooperatives every day already accounts for more than 70 percent of the amount on the market.
    In order to help farmers in disaster-stricken areas overcome the difficulties of seed shortages caused by natural disasters, state-owned grain companies, cooperatives, and People's Banks in various parts of Henan Province are actively supplying farmers with autumn grain seeds and issuing grain planting loans. This year, the Henan Branch of the People's Bank of China has issued a total of 50 billion yuan in autumn grain seed loans, and 80 percent of these loans have already been distributed to rural areas. These loans will enable farmers to buy seeds for about 1.5 million mu of land. Since the beginning of May, state-owned grain companies in Henan Province have successively transferred large quantities of autumn grain seeds such as sorghum, corn, millet, and soybeans to various parts of the province. By the end of May, Luoyang, Xuchang, Zhengzhou, Xinyang, and other special districts had received more than 4.5 million jin of various autumn grain seeds. Cooperatives in various places have also prepared a large amount of fertilizer, farm tools, and daily necessities to meet the needs of farmers.
    According to Xinhua News Agency: New wheat has been successively put on the market in Zhejiang, Shaanxi, Shandong and other provinces. After the bumper wheat harvest in Zhejiang Province, under the guidance of the correct national price policy, the amount of wheat put on the market has been very large, generally exceeding the amount originally estimated by the local grain companies and cooperatives. In May, the province purchased 236 percent of the originally planned amount of wheat. Since the beginning of June, the wheat market has been even more prosperous, with 4 to 5 million jin of wheat being put on the market throughout the province every day. From June 1st to 5th, the Shouchang County Grain Company purchased more than 386,000 jin of wheat, reaching 96.5 percent of the total monthly purchase plan for June. The company originally entrusted the cooperative to purchase 300,000 jin of wheat in June, but within only five days, it had nearly completed the purchase task. The two parties are now negotiating to renew the agency purchase contract for 300,000 jin. During the purchase process, some areas raised the listed prices in a timely manner, avoiding the decline of grain prices in the market, which made the farmers very satisfied and enthusiastically sold their grain. The wheat purchased by state-owned grain companies and cooperatives generally accounts for more than 90 percent of the amount on the market. Grain companies and cooperatives have prepared a large amount of rice, fertilizer, and daily necessities in wheat-producing areas to facilitate farmers' purchases.
    This year's summer crops in southern Shaanxi Province have generally had a bumper harvest. In the last five days of May, the new wheat put on the market in Nanzheng City reached more than 119,000 jin, and the new wheat put on the market in Ankang in the three days of the last ten days of May reached more than 50,000 jin. These are the two places with the largest amount of wheat on the market. In the Guanzhong area, the three counties of Tongchuan, Dali, and Chaoyi also put 3,000 to 8,000 jin of new wheat on the market every day.
    New wheat has been successively put on the market in Shandong Province, and the Provincial Cooperative will soon begin purchasing. Grain warehouses in various special districts and counties have been repaired and disinfected. Liaocheng and Changwei Special Districts have reserved more than 65 million jin of bean cake and chemical fertilizers, ready to supply farmers. A large amount of corn, millet, red sorghum, yarn, cloth, and daily necessities are also being transported to wheat-producing areas.

    在正确的价格政策指导下农民踊跃售粮
    河南、浙江等省大量收购小麦
    据新华社讯：中南各省都已开始收购新麦。中南行政委员会粮食管理局在六月二日指示各省国营粮食公司和合作社在一切产麦地区照顾群众需要，设点多收，并保持市场的合理价格，不使农民吃亏；在交通不便地区也设立收购点，以解决农民售麦的困难；在收购同时，尽量给予农民购买大米杂粮以便利，同时并商请当地商业部门大力供应农民以必需的生活资料和生产资料。指示并要求各省粮食部门组织巡回检查小组，督促检查收购工作，切实有效地帮助基层收购单位解决实际困难。
    河南省合作社联合社已全面展开收购工作。今年河南省各地合作社为国营粮食公司代购的小麦占该省粮食公司全年收购计划的百分之六十五，较去年合作社代购小麦的数量增加百分之四十二点六。在全省主要的小麦产区，合作社已和国营粮食公司成立了联合办公室，双方并决定经常抽调干部组织检查组，到基层收购点进行检查。现在，合作社和国营粮食公司在全省各中、小城镇设立的一千三百多个小麦收购点，已普遍开始收购。小麦上市较早的潢川、光山、固始、罗山等县，合作社每天收购的小麦，已占上市量的百分之七十以上。
    为帮助受灾地区农民克服自然灾害造成的缺种困难，河南省各地国营粮食公司和合作社、人民银行等部门正积极向农民供应秋粮种籽和发放种粮贷款。中国人民银行河南省分行今年发放秋粮种籽贷款总数为五百亿元，目前已有百分之八十发放到农村。这些贷款大约可使农民买到播种一百五十万亩土地的种籽。河南省国营粮食公司从五月初开始，就先后把高粱、玉米、谷子、大豆等大批秋粮种籽调到全省各地。到五月底止，洛阳、许昌、郑州、信阳等专区就得到了各种秋粮种籽四百五十多万斤。各地合作社还准备了大量的肥料、农具和日用百货，供应农民的需要。
    据新华社讯：浙江、陕西、山东等省新麦陆续上市。浙江省小麦丰收后，在国家正确价格政策指导下，小麦上市量很大，一般都超过了各地粮食公司和合作社原来估计的上市量。五月份全省收购小麦的数量为原订收购计划的百分之二百三十六。六月份开始以来，小麦上市更旺，全省每天都有四百万到五百万斤小麦上市。寿昌县粮食公司六月一日到五日收购小麦三十八万六千多斤，达六月份全月收购计划的百分之九十六点五。该公司原委托合作社在六月份收购小麦三十万斤，仅五天内便已接近完成收购任务，现在双方正在协商续订三十万斤的代购合同。在收购中，有些地区适时挂高牌价，避免了粮价在市场上下跌，农民非常满意，踊跃售粮。各地国营粮食公司和合作社收购的小麦一般占上市量百分之九十以上。粮食公司和合作社在产麦区准备了大批大米、肥料和日用品，以便农民购买。
    陕西省南部今年夏田普遍丰收，五月下旬的后五天内，南郑市上市的新麦达十一万九千多斤，安康五月下旬的三天内上市新麦达五万多斤，这是两个上市量较大的地方。关中地区的铜川、大荔和朝邑三县，每日上市的新麦也达三千至八千斤。
    山东省新麦已经陆续上市，省合作社即将开始收购。各专区、县粮仓都已经过修补、消毒。聊城、昌潍两专区已储备六千五百余万斤豆饼、化学肥料，准备供应农民。大批玉米、谷子、红粮和纱、布、日用品等，也源源运往产麦地区。
