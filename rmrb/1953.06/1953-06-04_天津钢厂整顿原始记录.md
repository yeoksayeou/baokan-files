    Tianjin Steel Plant Rectification Original Records
    [This newspaper dispatch] The state-owned Tianjin Steel Plant launched a discussion among its workers and staff in early April regarding the production plan. After determining new technical and economic norms, and following the instructions of the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry, it began to rectify the plant’s original records to prepare for the implementation of planned management.
    In 1950, the plant established original records. In the first half of 1951, cadres throughout the plant, through two rounds of drafting plans and studying economic accounting systems, began to use the records to draft and inspect plans. The plant established relatively comprehensive original records, including output, quality, raw material consumption, equipment utilization, and labor allocation. Operation records and some team records were also added. The workshop's original record work continuously developed, and it was basically able to be timely and accurate. At the end of 1951, it created a new record of calculating the previous month's costs in eight days. When drafting the 1952 plan and revising the 1952 production increase and economy plan, the records were used to calculate intermediate progressive quotas, and according to the records, more advanced quotas were formulated. In the second half of 1952, more than 70% of the teams in the plant established original records. Some teams were able to discover and solve problems from record accounting.
    Last winter, when the plant was drafting the 1953 plan, it found that the original records of the workshop and the plant headquarters were not unified. The intermediate cost accounting had one set of records, and the planning statistician had another set of records for assessing the plan. The figures of the plant's accounting, statistics, production technology and other departments were inconsistent with each other. At the same time, there were too many duplicate forms. Some teams spent two hours making records after work, which increased the burden on workers. In order to overcome these shortcomings, after preparing the 1953 plan, the plant carried out a rectification of original records throughout the plant: First, based on the experience of the original records, a series of complete record systems were established. The team records were the basis, the workshop records were compiled based on the team records, and the accounting, statistical accounting, and business accounting of each workshop were based on the workshop records, so that the figures were truly unified. Second, streamline the forms and merge similar items. The team records only require workers to accurately record figures, and minimize the accounting work of the workers. The workshop accounting group quickly helped the team to comprehensively account, and told the team the results, so that the workers knew what was happening. Third, the workshop accounting group uniformly controlled the workshop accounting work.
    After a month of rectification, the plant initially improved the workshop original record system, and began to trial it in various workshops in February this year. In the plan discussion in early April, the original record system sorted out at the beginning of the year was used as the basis, and individual unsuitable places were modified. The specific approach is:
    First, explain the importance of original records to the workers and correct wrong perceptions. For example, some workshop cadres said: "Making so many forms is entirely for the departments, and the workshop is wasting its efforts." Individual workers said: "Making forms is a matter for the office, we can't do it, and it's useless to do this kind of work." Some workers also had complacent feelings, thinking: "Our original records have been sorted out five or six times, and now they are quite good, why are we still sorting them out?" In response to these ideas, the plant leadership first pointed out at the mobilization meeting of rectification of original records cadres: Original records are the basis of planned management. With correct and timely original records, we can correctly understand the situation, discover and overcome shortcomings in production, so as to ensure the completion and over-fulfillment of the national plan. This corrected the wrong perception of some people who did not attach importance to original records, and at the same time, it also criticized the complacent mood, and explained that the current original records still have shortcomings, such as some are still inaccurate and untimely; some have excessive requirements or incomplete content, and the forms are not simple and clear enough, so they cannot comprehensively reflect production activities.
    Second, organize forces, break through one point, and promote the overall situation. The reason why the plant's past original record system failed to be implemented was mainly because it did not grasp the key points. This time, seven cadres from relevant functional departments who were more familiar with the business were transferred, and a deputy section chief from the accounting section was designated to specifically lead this work. At the same time, the forces were concentrated on the wire rod department and the newly established fourth branch plant, which had weaker cadre forces, to specifically help with the work. Due to the personal leadership of the workshop director and the help of the functional departments, the wire rod department adopted the methods of leadership explanation, mass discussion, and apprentice training, and quickly improved the original records. The plant then widely promoted this experience.
    Third, learn, teach, do, and check at the same time. The plant organized cadres from functional departments to go to the workshops to help rectify the original records, and adopted the method of training apprentices at all levels to overcome the difficulties of low business level of cadres. First, the head of the workshop accounting group and the cadres from the functional departments who went to the workshop taught the form reporters and accountants, and the form reporters and accountants immediately taught the workers responsible for accounting in the team after they learned it. When teaching, only one form was taught each time, and everyone was required to learn how to make the form and understand the role of the form, and to understand the relationship between this form and other forms. In this way, it takes a maximum of fifteen minutes to learn a form. Learning is done during production time, which does not affect production or take up leisure time. After the workers learned a form, they immediately applied it to actual work. The cadres then went to check and correct possible errors; the plant also sent people to the workshops in rotation to check and consolidate the results. In this way, in just a few days, the workers learned all the forms. In the process of learning and doing, the workers also checked and improved the shortcomings of the original forms. For example, the galvanizing team of the wire rod department used to have only one general operation record. After work, the workers rushed to fill it out from memory, which was time-consuming and inaccurate. This time, one form was divided into several small forms, which can be filled out separately during work.
    By the end of April, Tianjin Steel Plant had basically sorted out the original records of the workshops and teams, and gradually achieved accuracy and timeliness. In May, the plant continued to consolidate the original records of the workshops and teams, and further sorted out the material supply relationship between departments and between departments and workshops, clarified the division of labor between statistical accounting and various business accounting, and strengthened the connection between departments, so as to streamline the reports. Finally, according to the sorting results, the original record system at all levels of the plant will be revised and improved, so that the achievements of this work can be guaranteed organizationally and institutionally, and can be further consolidated and developed.

    天津钢厂整顿原始记录
    【本报讯】国营天津钢厂四月初发动职工群众讨论生产计划，确定了新的技术经济定额后，根据中央重工业部指示，又着手整顿全厂原始记录，为实行计划管理准备条件。
    在一九五零年，该厂就建立了原始记录。一九五一年上半年，全厂干部通过两次编制计划和学习经济核算制，开始利用记录来编制计划和检查计划。全厂建立了包括产量、质量、原材料消耗、设备利用、劳动力配备等较全面的原始记录，又增添了操作记录和部分小组记录。车间原始记录工作不断发展，基本上已能作到及时、正确。一九五一年底曾创造了八天算出上月成本的新记录。在编制一九五二年计划和修订一九五二年增产节约计划时，利用记录计算出中等累进定额，并根据记录加以分析，制定了比较先进的定额。一九五二年下半年全厂百分之七十以上的小组都建立了原始记录。有些小组能从记录核算中发现和解决问题。
    去年冬，该厂编制一九五三年计划时，发现车间和厂部的原始记录不统一，中间成本会计核算成本有一套记录，计划统计员考核计划又有一套记录，厂部会计、统计和生产技术等课的数字彼此不一致。同时，表格重复太多，有些小组下班作记录，往往要用去两小时时间，增加了工人负担。该厂为了克服这些缺点，在编好一九五三年计划后，全厂进行了一次原始记录的整顿工作：第一，根据原有记录的经验，建立了一系列的完整的记录制度，以小组记录为基础，车间记录根据小组记录编制，各车间的会计核算、统计核算和业务核算都以车间记录为依据，做到数字确实统一。第二，精简表格，合并同类项目。小组记录只要求工人正确记录数字，尽量减轻工人的核算工作。车间核算组很快地帮助小组综合核算，把结果告诉小组，使工人心中有数。第三，车间核算组统一掌握车间核算工作。
    经过一个月的整顿，该厂初步健全了车间原始记录制度，今年二月开始在各车间试行。四月初讨论计划中即以年初整理出的原始记录制度作为根据，对个别不适合的地方加以修改。具体的做法是：
    首先向职工讲清原始记录的重要性，纠正错误认识。譬如有的车间干部说：“搞这么多表，完全是为各课作的，车间白费力气。”个别的工人说：“作表是办公室的事，咱干不了，作这行子也没用。”也有些职工有自满情绪，认为：“咱们的原始记录已经整理了五、六回，现在满不错了，还整理它干什么。”针对这些思想，该厂领导方面首先在整顿原始记录干部动员会上指出：原始记录是计划管理的基础，有了正确及时的原始记录，才能正确了解情况，发现和克服生产上的缺点，以保证完成和超额完成国家计划。这就纠正了一部分人不重视原始记录的错误认识，同时，也批判了自满情绪，说明了现在的原始记录还是有缺点的，如还有的不正确，不及时；还有的要求过高或内容不全，表格不够简单明了，因而还不能全面地反映生产活动情况。
    其次，组织力量，突破一点，推动全面。该厂过去原始记录制度未能贯彻执行的原因，主要是没有抓住重点，这次抽调有关职能科七个业务比较熟悉的干部，并指定会计课一个副科长专门领导这一工作。同时把力量集中到干部力量较弱的线材部和新成立的四分厂两个车间去具体帮助工作。线材部由于车间主任亲自领导和职能科的帮助，采用了领导讲解、群众讨论和带徒弟的办法，很快地健全了原始记录。该厂随即普遍推广这一经验。
    第三，边学、边教、边作、边检查。该厂组织职能科干部下车间帮助整顿原始记录，采用了层层带徒弟的办法，克服了干部业务水平低的困难。首先由车间核算组长和职能科下车间的干部教表报员和核算员，表报员和核算员学会了马上教给小组负责核算的工人。在教的时候，每次只教一个表，要求
    大家学会作表和懂得表的作用，并且要了解这个表
    和其他表的关系。这样做法，学一个表最多用十五
    分钟时间，在生产时间内抽空来学习，既不影响生产，又不占业余时间。职工们学会了一张表，马上就
    运用到实际工作中去。干部接着就去检查，纠正可能发生的错误；厂部也派人轮流到各车间去检查，巩固成绩。这样在短短的几天内，职工们把全部的表都学会了。在边学、边作中，职工也检查和改进了原有表格的缺点。如线材部镀锌小组，以前只有一张总的操作记录，工人们下班后凭记忆挨个抢着填写，又耽误时间又不准确，这次把一张表分成几张小表，在工作中就可以分别填写。
    到四月底为止，天津钢厂基本上已把车间和小组的原始记录整理好，并且逐步做到了正确、及时。该厂在五月份，继续巩固车间和小组的原始记录，并进一步整理各课之间与车间和各课之间的资料供应关系，明确区别统计核算和各种业务核算的分工，加强课与课之间的联系，以便做到精简表报。最后根据整理结果，修订、健全全厂各级的原始记录制度，使此项工作成绩得到组织上、制度上的保证，能进一步巩固和发展下去。
