Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 20th - TASS: Security organs of the German Democratic Republic have arrested a number of agitators involved with West Berlin agents in organizing riots in the democratic sector of Berlin. The interrogation authorities have released the interrogation record of Werner Kharkovsky, who was arrested on June 17th.

According to the law, this confession has been confirmed by Kharkovsky, and he has affirmed that the confession is true.

Werner Kharkovsky was born in 1916 in Gestro, Mecklenburg. He is German, not affiliated with any political party, married, an actor by profession, and currently unemployed. Address: 34 Naunyn Street, Berlin.

Q: In which district of Berlin do you reside?

A: I live in the American sector.

Q: How did you and others get arrested for organizing riots in the democratic sector of Berlin?

A: On the morning of June 17th, I and some other people – no fewer than ninety – were sent from West Berlin to the democratic sector. We were to organize riots here and recruit striking workers to join the riots.

Q: Who gave you this task?

A: On the afternoon of June 16th at 6:00 PM, Paul Guenther came to my house (I knew him from Gestro, and he also lives in West Berlin). He said that if I participated in organizing the riots in the democratic sector of Berlin, I could receive very generous compensation.

Guenther also told me that organizing the riots would be facilitated because some workers in the democratic sector were going to hold a strike. This strike had to be turned into a riot. When I heard this, I said that I was willing to participate in this crime because I needed money. The next morning, I received more detailed instructions on how to carry this out.

Q: Explain this in more detail.

A: Guenther told me before leaving that I had to wait at Breitenbachplatz at 8:00 AM on June 17th. I did so. I arrived at that place on time and found at least ninety people already there, including Josef Schneider, Georg Goerke, Reinhold Marohl, Rudolf Ansinski, Walter Harke, and Günther Niemitz. These people were led by Paul Guenther, Hans Jürgen, and an American named Heaver, wearing a military uniform with two-star epaulets. Guenther told us that our job was to enter the democratic sector of Berlin, mingle with the striking workers, and turn the peaceful strike into a riot demanding the overthrow of the government of the German Democratic Republic.

Guenther also told us that we had to actively participate in the riot ourselves. We were ordered to attack government office buildings, commit arson, rob stores, assault the People's Police, generally take action against the authorities, and use weapons.

The American, Heaver, spoke after Guenther. He demanded that we complete our task in the best possible way and promised to give each of us three months of vacation. Those of us who were unemployed could become policemen in West Berlin after this and receive generous salaries.

In addition, it was promised that we would each receive fifty West German marks after returning from the democratic sector.

Q: What measures did you and your accomplices take against the workers in the democratic sector to carry out provocations?

A: After receiving the instructions to organize the riots, we formed a tight group and crossed the Potsdam Bridge to Potsdamer Platz. There, we mingled with the striking workers. From that moment on, we began to carry out our instructions, which were to shout slogans inciting the masses against the government of the German Democratic Republic and other authorities.

About twenty people in our group had bottles filled with gasoline, which were taken from an American truck on the Potsdam Bridge for arson. For example, I personally saw Günther Niemitz take such a bottle.

Those of us with gasoline bottles began setting fire to various buildings on Potsdamer Platz. I personally saw Günther Niemitz throw a bottle into the "HO" (state-owned store) belonging to the state trading system, causing it to burn. In addition, many of us threw stones at the People's Police and broke windows. In this way, we marched with the masses to the government building on Leipziger Strasse and continued to cause trouble. But this time we opened fire on the People's Police and personnel in Soviet tanks.

Q: Did you yourself fire a gun?

A: I did not shoot because I did not have a weapon, but I clearly saw Hans Jürgen shoot a Soviet soldier with a pistol. I do not know if he hit him. On Leipziger Strasse, my job was to incite the masses to demonstrate against the government with slogans such as "Down with the government!" and other defamatory slogans. In inciting the masses, we received great help from the Americans, who had placed two very large loudspeakers on the border. These loudspeakers constantly broadcast inflammatory speeches in German and Russian. The Russian broadcasts were made by Anton Löffler. He demanded that the police and Soviet troops not take measures against the rioters and not cross the border into West Berlin.

    西柏林特务卡尔科夫斯基招供组织暴乱经过
    【新华社讯】塔斯社柏林二十日电：德意志民主共和国保安机关逮捕了许多与西柏林特务在柏林民主区组织的骚乱有关的煽动分子。审讯机构发表了对六月十七日逮捕的维尔纳·卡尔科夫斯基的审讯记录。
    按照法律，这一口供已交给卡尔科夫斯基证实，他已确认这一口供是真实的。
    维尔纳·卡尔科夫斯基于一九一六年生于梅格林堡的格斯特罗，他是德国人，未参加政党，已婚，职业是演员，现失业。住址：柏林瑙宁街三十四号。
    问：你住在柏林哪一区？
    答：我住在美占区。
    问：在柏林民主区组织骚乱事件中，你怎么会和其他的人一起被逮捕的？
    答：六月十七日早晨，我和另外一些人——不下九十个人，从西柏林被派到民主区来。我们要在这里组织暴动，并且吸收罢工工人参加暴动。
    问：这个任务是谁给你的？
    答：在六月十六日午后六时，保罗·古恩廷到我家里来找我（我是在格斯特罗认识他的，他也住在西柏林），他说，假使我参加组织柏林民主区的骚乱的话，我可以得到很优厚的报酬。
    古恩廷同时告诉我说，组织暴乱将因为民主区的一些工人将举行一次罢工而便于进行。必须使这种罢工转成为一次暴动。当我听到这句话的时候，我说，我愿意参加这一罪行，因为我需要钱。第二天清早我收到了关于如何进行这件事的更详尽的指示。
    问：把这件事讲得更详细些。
    答：古恩廷在离开的时候告诉我，六月十七日上午八点，我一定要等在布列顿巴哈广场。我这样做了。我准时到达了那个地方，发现至少已经有九十个人在场，其中有约瑟夫·施奈德、格奥格·格尔克、兰霍德·马罗尔、鲁道夫·安辛斯基、华尔特·哈尔克、根特·尼米兹。这些人由保罗·古恩廷、汉斯·朱尔根和一个着军装戴有两星肩章的美国人海佛尔领头。古恩廷告诉我们说，我们的工作是进入柏林民主区，混进那里的罢工工人行列，把和平的罢工变成要求推翻德意志民主共和国政府的暴动。
    古恩廷又告诉我们，我们必须亲自积极参加这次暴动。我们奉命袭击政府各部门办公大楼、纵火、抢商店、突击人民警察、普遍地采取反对当局的行动并使用武器。
    美国人海佛尔继古恩廷之后说话。他要求我们用最好的办法完成我们的任务，并且答应给我们每个人三个月的假期。我们之中没有工作的人在这件事情以后可以到西柏林当警察，领取优厚的薪水。
    此外还答应我们在从民主区回来以后，每人发给五十个西德马克。
    问：你和你的帮凶为了进行挑衅，对民主区的工人采取了什么措施？
    答：在接到了组织暴乱的指示以后，我们这些人结成了紧紧的一群，过波茨坦桥到了波茨坦广场。我们在那里混进了罢工工人的行列。从那个时候起，我们就开始执行我们的指示，就是：高喊鼓动群众反对德意志民主共和国政府和其它当局的口号。
    我们这群人里面大约有二十个人手里有装满汽油的瓶子，这些瓶子是从波茨坦桥上的一辆美国卡车上拿来放火用的。譬如说，我就亲眼看到根特·尼米兹拿到这样的一个瓶子。
    我们之中有汽油瓶子的人在波茨坦广场上开始在各个大厦纵火。我亲眼看到根特·尼米兹扔了一个瓶子到属于国家贸易系统的“HO”（国营商店）里去，使它燃烧起来。此外，我们之中有许多人向人民警察扔石头，并打破窗子。就像这样，我们与群众一同走到来比锡大街上的政府大厦前面，继续捣乱。但是这一次我们向人民警察和苏联坦克车上的人员开枪射击。
    问：你自己也开了枪吗？
    答：我没有射击，因为我没有武器，但是我清楚地看见汉斯·朱尔根用手枪向一个苏联士兵射击。他是否打中了他我不知道。在来比锡大街上我的工作是煽动群众举行示威，在“打倒政府！”和其它污蔑性的口号下反对政府。在煽动群众的工作中，我们得到美国人的极大帮助，他们在边界上安置了两个极大的扩音器。这些扩音器不停地用德语和俄语广播煽动性的演说。俄语广播是安顿·洛夫勒广播的。他要求警察和苏联军队不要对暴徒采取措施，不要越过边界到西柏林来。
