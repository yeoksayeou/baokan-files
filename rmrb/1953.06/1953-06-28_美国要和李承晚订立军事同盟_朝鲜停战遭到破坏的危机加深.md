Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, June 27th. Special Correspondent Jiang Nan reports: The crisis of undermining the Korean armistice has not only not eased, but has further deepened.

Dulles announced on the 26th that Eisenhower had suggested to Syngman Rhee that after the armistice and before the political conference is convened, a high-level political conference be held between the United States and Syngman Rhee to discuss the future of Korea. Sources say that the main topic of this meeting will be the conclusion of a military alliance between the United States and Syngman Rhee. Today, Robertson, Syngman Rhee, and Clark held so-called "optimistic" talks in Seoul. According to Agence France-Presse, Robertson revealed that the United States is prepared to immediately negotiate a "mutual security treaty" with South Korea.

What does a U.S.-Rhee military alliance mean? Naturally, people can see at a glance that this alliance means that although the U.S. authorities have had to express their agreement to the armistice after three years of defeat, they are still unwilling to give up and do not want to abandon their military plans in Korea. In the current situation, this alliance prominently means continuing to tie American soldiers to Syngman Rhee's broken chariot. Syngman Rhee has publicly announced that he will use a method "more agreeable to him" to solve the Korean problem, which is to use a military alliance between the United States and Syngman Rhee to ensure that he can continue to fight, and to decorate his never-to-be-realized plan of unifying Korea by force with the lives and blood of more South Koreans, Americans, British, and French people.

The reason why Syngman Rhee's arrogance is so rampant is because he knows that he has supporters in the United States. Senator Bridges, chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, repeated his old tune on the 25th, saying that if the prisoner-of-war plan fails, the United States should "go it alone" in Korea. He even said: "In order to completely end the Korean War, we will have reason to use atomic weapons." Naturally, Bridges' threats cannot scare the heroic and determined Korean and Chinese people at all, but they are a tonic for Syngman Rhee. After receiving Eisenhower's letter promising to conclude a "mutual defense treaty" with him, Syngman Rhee clamored: "We only have one way to go, and that is to continue the struggle until we achieve victory or failure." It is very obvious that a military alliance with the United States is the only backer for Syngman Rhee to dare to continue the war. The Belgian newspaper "Modern Report" is very right: "This South Korean army, which depends on the United States for its existence, how can it wage war without American supplies?" The United States continues to supply the supplies of the Syngman Rhee puppet army on the front line.

The United States and Syngman Rhee are about to conclude a military alliance, preparing to bury a time bomb for the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue after the armistice, if the armistice agreement can be signed. Syngman Rhee and his American supporters will be able to use this military alliance to undermine the political conference, to undermine the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue, and to launch the war again, as they did three years ago. For Syngman Rhee, it is easy to start a new war. He has said that "even if an armistice agreement is signed, the war will still break out in the same way," and once the war restarts, "the United States will help us as before."

The Korean armistice has not yet been realized, and the United States has not yet responded to the issues raised by the Korean and Chinese sides, but the shadow over the future of the armistice is getting darker and darker. The U.S. State Department once announced that Syngman Rhee was under U.S. control. But people are now increasingly doubtful: Is the U.S. government prepared to put Syngman Rhee under its control to make him accept the armistice? Or is it putting Syngman Rhee under its control to encourage him to undermine the armistice and peace in Korea?

### 美国要和李承晚订立军事同盟  朝鲜停战遭到破坏的危机加深

    美国要和李承晚订立军事同盟  朝鲜停战遭到破坏的危机加深
    【新华社开城二十七日电】本社特派记者江南报道：朝鲜停战遭到破坏的危机，现在非但没有缓和，反而进一步加深了。
    杜勒斯二十六日宣布，艾森豪威尔已经向李承晚建议，在停战以后，政治会议召开之前，美国和李承晚之间举行高级政治会议，以讨论朝鲜前途问题。有消息说，这次会议将主要讨论美国和李承晚缔结军事同盟的问题。今天，罗伯逊、李承晚还加上克拉克又在汉城举行所谓“乐观的”会谈。据法新社报道，罗伯逊透露，美国准备立即与南朝鲜谈判一个“共同安全条约”。
    美李军事同盟，这是什么意思呢？自然，人们一望而知，这个同盟意味着：尽管美国当局在三年的败战之后不得不表示它同意停战，但它仍没有心死，还不想放弃它在朝鲜的军事计划。在目前的局势中，这个同盟突出地意味着把美国士兵继续拴在李承晚的残破的战车上。李承晚已经公开宣布要用对他“更适意一些”的办法来解决朝鲜问题，这个办法就是用一个美国和李承晚之间的军事同盟来保证他能够继续打下去，并且用更多的南朝鲜人、美国人、英国人、法国人的性命和鲜血，来装璜他的永不能实现的武力统一朝鲜的计划。
    李承晚的气焰之所以如此嚣张，是因为他知道他在美国有支持者。美国参院拨款委员会主席布里奇斯二十五日又重复他在几个星期前的老调，说如果战俘计划失败，美国应该在朝鲜“单独干下去”。他甚至说：“为了使朝鲜战争完全结束，我们将有理由使用原子武器。”自然，布里奇斯的要挟一点也吓不倒英勇坚定的朝中人民，但对李承晚倒是一付强心剂。李承晚在接到艾森豪威尔答应和他订立“共同防御条约”的信以后，就叫嚣说：“我们只有一条路可走，那就是继续斗争，直到我们获得胜利或失败时为止。”十分明显，和美国订立军事同盟，是李承晚敢于继续战争的唯一靠山。比利时的“现代报”说得很对：“这个依附美国存在的南朝鲜军队，假如没有美国供应，怎样能进行战争？”在前线的李承晚伪军的供应品，美国仍然继续供给。
    美国和李承晚要订立军事同盟，是准备为停战后的朝鲜问题的和平解决埋伏下一颗定时炸弹，如果停战协定能够签订的话。李承晚和他的美国支持者将可以利用这个军事同盟来破坏政治会议，来破坏朝鲜问题的和平解决，来再次发动战争，像他们在三年前所干的那样。对于李承晚来说，发动新的战争是很容易的事情。他已经说过，“即使签订了停战协定，战事还是会同样爆发起来”，而一旦战事重起，“美国将像以前一样援助我们”。
    朝鲜停战还没有实现，美国对于朝中方面提出的问题还没有作出答复，停战前途上的阴影却越来越浓了。美国国务院曾经宣布过，李承晚是在美国控制之下的。可是人们现在越来越怀疑：美国政府是准备把李承晚放在它的控制之下，来使他接受停战呢？还是把李承晚放在它的控制之下，来鼓励他破坏朝鲜的停战与和平呢？
