　　Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, June 24th, Special Correspondent Jiang Nan reports: After his meeting with Syngman Rhee, Clark has already returned to Tokyo, but Syngman Rhee is still unwilling to abandon his attempt to sabotage the armistice.
　　When Clark arrived in Korea, American news agencies widely publicized that Clark was coming to "settle accounts" with Syngman Rhee. But the fact is that it was not Clark who "settled accounts," but Syngman Rhee, who was determined to undermine the armistice. After Clark left, Syngman Rhee told a United Press reporter that he had presented Clark with an "ultimatum" during their "very friendly" meeting. He released his letter to Clark today.
　　Syngman Rhee threatens to sabotage the Korean armistice. He told Clark that once the current armistice agreement is signed, "I will let you know as a friend that I have decided to withdraw my troops from the partial jurisdiction of the United Nations."
　　Syngman Rhee's increasingly arrogant actions are part of his rumored plan to sabotage the armistice. According to International News Service, Syngman Rhee's plan is: first, launch anti-armistice demonstrations; second, "release" prisoners of war; third, refuse to withdraw from the demilitarized zone; fourth, fight against the Indian troops arriving in Korea to carry out the mission of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission; and fifth, assassinate personnel sent by the DPRK and China, Poland, and Czechoslovakia to South Korea to implement the armistice agreement. Syngman Rhee has long clamored to "continue alone" and "fight to the Yalu River." Syngman Rhee is attempting, with the connivance of the United States, to realize his plan step by step.
　　It can be clearly seen that because the U.S. government has not taken responsible measures to stop Syngman Rhee from sabotaging the prisoner of war repatriation agreement, Syngman Rhee increasingly feels that he is confident in undermining the Korean armistice. The seriousness of the problem lies in the fact that Syngman Rhee's words and deeds pose an increasingly serious threat to the prospects of the armistice, while the U.S. is still adopting an attitude of indulgence. The whole world is now waiting for the U.S. to prove with actions: do they want to continue to indulge Syngman Rhee to undermine the almost realized Korean armistice? Or do they take responsibility for handling this matter to show their sincerity for the armistice?

### 在美方纵容下李承晚继续叫嚣要破坏停战

    在美方纵容下李承晚继续叫嚣要破坏停战
    【新华社开城二十四日电】本社特派记者江南报道：克拉克在和李承晚会谈之后已经回到东京，但是李承晚仍然丝毫不愿意放弃他的破坏停战的企图。
    在克拉克到达朝鲜的时候，美国通讯社大肆宣传说克拉克是来向李承晚“摊牌”的。但是事实是：“摊牌”的并不是克拉克，而是一心要破坏停战的李承晚。李承晚在克拉克走了以后就向合众社记者发表谈话说：他在和克拉克举行的“非常友好的”会谈中向克拉克“提出了最后通牒”。他在今天公布了他给克拉克的信。
    李承晚威胁着要破坏朝鲜停战。他告诉克拉克说：一旦目前的停战协定签订，“我将以对待朋友之道让你知道我已经决定要把我的军队从联合国局部管辖下撤出来。”
    李承晚这种越来越嚣张的行动，是传闻中的他的破坏停战的计划之一部分。据国际新闻社透露，李承晚的计划是：第一步发动反停战示威；第二步“释放”战俘；第三步拒绝撤出非军事区；第四步对到达朝鲜执行中立国遣返委员会任务的印度军队作战；第五步是暗杀朝中方面和波兰、捷克斯洛伐克派赴南朝鲜执行停战协定的人员。李承晚好久以来就扬言要“继续单独干下去”，“打到鸭绿江”。李承晚正企图在美国的纵容下一步又一步地实现他的计划。
    人们可以明显地看到，由于美国政府一直没有采取负责的措施来制止李承晚破坏战俘遣返协议，李承晚越来越觉得他有把握破坏朝鲜停战了。问题的严重性就在于：李承晚的言论和行为，对于停战的前途构成越来越严重的威胁，而美方却仍然采取纵容的态度。全世界现在都等待着美方用行动来证明：他们是想用继续纵容李承晚来破坏快要实现的朝鲜停战呢？还是负起责任处理这次事件，来表明他们对于停战的诚意？
