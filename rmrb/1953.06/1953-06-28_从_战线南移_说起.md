　　Starting from the "Southern Shift of the Frontline"
　　Huang Gang
　　The Korean people's war of resistance against aggression has been going on for three years. Today, observers from all countries around the world, including newspapers like the New York Daily Mirror, have seen and acknowledged that "the United States has suffered its first real defeat in history in Korea." Even the hawkish Van Fleet has recently changed his clamor for a "military victory" and admitted that he only "originally hoped that the Americans would defeat the Chinese and rebuild America's prestige in the Far East." And now? Van Fleet says, "It's not necessary to do that now." The arrogant thug Van Fleet says it's "not necessary" to do so because now even he is increasingly aware that there is indeed no possibility of winning on the Korean battlefield.
　　Coinciding with Van Fleet's above lament, Van Fleet's successor, the new commander of the U.S. Eighth Army, Lieutenant General Taylor, hurriedly went to inspect the east-central region of Korea on June 12th. What happened there was the opposite of the U.S. imperialists' military attempt to push the military demarcation line north more than a year ago: the front line continued to move south before mid-June. In other words, the U.S. and Rhee forces were collapsing one hill after another.
　　In order to conceal this embarrassing defeat, the U.S. military imposed strict censorship on battlefield news from the previous period. While Taylor and Paik Sun-yup were rushing to inspect the "fluidity" of their front line, the U.S.-controlled news agencies were still under orders to issue news of "no major changes" on the Korean front. On June 11th, International News Service issued a dispatch from Yeoju saying that since November 1951, the changes on the front line had not exceeded half a mile in any section. But the actual situation was not as lightly portrayed by the enemy, but as reported by Xinhua News Agency special correspondent on June 18th: "The entire front line has moved south... In one place in the central sector, the front line has moved eight kilometers south. Some famous hills where fierce battles had taken place, such as 'Old Baldy,' 'Anchor Hill,' and 'Kyonggi Hill,' are now located north of the front line."
　　Although the American generals can turn a deaf ear to their defeat, the enemy soldiers admit the military reality on the Korean battlefield much more readily. Sergeant Bradley of the U.S. 3rd Division, who fought in Korea in 1951, admitted on June 11th that "I have never seen such artillery fire as last night." Under the news blockade, U.S. reports still revealed the embarrassment of the defeated U.S. soldiers: one soldier of the U.S. 3rd Division was hit and kept shouting: "God, God, protect my body!" The U.S. reporter described them as "a strange team of defeated American infantry." What kind of team was this? According to the U.S. reporter, some were "crawling on their stomachs," "staggering," "running barefoot," "panic-stricken," and suddenly "frightened into running for eighteen hours"... This is the main bet that the warmongers rely on in the Korean War: the appearance today of the Eighth Army infantry, which U.S. Army Chief of Staff Collins recently boasted was "unparalleled in American military history."
　　The warmongers originally relied on "powerful" "artillery superiority" on the ground to support their infantry in an attempt to move the front line north. However, the American news agencies described the facts on the Korean battlefield in early June this year as: the Korean and Chinese side "used the largest number of shells in the three-year history of the Korean War." According to the Associated Press, "From June 1st to 15th, 759,437 shells crossed the front line and landed on the Allied ground. The previous highest record in thirty days occurred in October 1952," when the Korean and Chinese forces "fired a total of 652,284 rounds." The bragging about the U.S.'s "artillery superiority" is now inaudible, and what is heard is the cry of U.S. soldier Poskati, who complained: "The Communist mortars have made me old. I will be lying on the ground crawling forward on the streets of Chicago, making people look at me strangely - it's completely a matter of habit becoming natural!" What a shrinking look!
　　When the military demarcation line was agreed upon in November two years ago, the U.S. military attempted to rely on its so-called "air superiority" in order to carry out military blackmail against our Korean and Chinese side. But at the end of May this year, Lieutenant General Barcus, who had commanded the U.S. Fifth Air Force, also concluded: "'Air superiority' has not, and cannot, defeat" the Korean and Chinese forces. Good, the trump card of "air superiority" also appears dim! What we can hear at this time are the complaining talks of U.S. Corporal Massey and soldier Ingram to the Associated Press reporter. They are "living like years" and "feeling very impatient" in the bunker where they were beaten in the western front, so they talked about: "Staying in Korea for thirty seconds feels too long," "I hope they use a jet plane to transport me back home."
　　This is the change on the Korean front line today.
　　This obvious change in the military situation, which is very unfavorable to the U.S. and Rhee forces, led the London Times to say at the end of May: "The military situation in Korea today" gives the Korean and Chinese side "some reason to congratulate themselves." Of course, the problem is not about "self-congratulation"; the problem is who can answer the words of an American advisor in the Rhee puppet army? He wondered and said: "We are trying to investigate what is causing us to be injured, and to what extent." Really, if we understand these things, it will not be without benefit to the American military adventurers and senior decision-makers. So, what is the reason why the invaders are injured and injured to such an extent? That is because: "Any attempt to solve the Korean problem by force, regardless of the rights and wishes of the Korean people, is bound to fail." (People's Daily editorial, June 25)
　　Now, even some American officials and observers cannot reach another conclusion. For example, former U.S. Ambassador to India Bowles recently admitted: "The Korean War has now told us that Asian troops with tenacious will cannot be defeated by pressing a button." Joseph Evans, a columnist for the Wall Street Journal, said: "Although the Korean War has brought all kinds of pain and tragedy, it can serve as a useful lesson in determining future policies if the United States can at least recognize that certain things cannot be done when a similar struggle occurs..."
　　--These words are well said, let those American military adventurers who are trying to investigate the reasons for their injuries keep them firmly in mind! ＊＊＊＊＊＊

### 从“战线南移”说起

　　从“战线南移”说起
    黄钢
    朝鲜人民反抗侵略的战争，已经进行三年了。今天，全世界不论哪一国的观察家，甚至包括纽约《每日镜报》这样的报纸在内，都看见和承认了“美国在朝鲜受到了历史上第一次真正失败”；一直到好战的范佛里特，近来也改变了他梦想要达到“军事胜利”的叫嚣，承认他仅是“当初希望美国人打败中国人，并在远东重建美国的威望”，现在呢？范佛里特说：“现在不一定要这样做”了。狂妄的打手范佛里特说“不一定”要这样做，这是因为现在连他也愈来愈认识到，在朝鲜战场上确已没有获胜的可能了。
    与范佛里特以上的感叹同时发生的事，是范佛里特职务的后继者，美国第八军新任的军长泰勒中将、六月十二日匆匆忙忙赶赴朝鲜中线偏东地区视察，在那里发生的事实，是与美帝国主义一年多以前想把军事分界线向北推移的军事企图相反：战线在六月中旬以前还在继续往南移动。也就是说，美李军正在一个山头一个山头地发生了溃败。
    为了掩饰这难堪的败绩，美军对前一时期的战地新闻实行了严密的封锁。美方的御用通讯社正当泰勒与白善桦仓皇去视察他们战线的“流动性”问题的时候，还在奉命发出所谓朝鲜战线“无大变化”的新闻。国际新闻社六月十一日还在汝山发出电讯说：自从一九五一年十一月以来，前线的变化在任何一段都没有超过半英里。但实际情况却并不似敌人所轻描淡写的那样，而是像六月十八日新华社特派记者所报道的：“整个前线都已南移。……在中线的一个地方，战线已向南移动了八公里。有些曾发生过激烈战斗的著名山头，如‘老秃山’、‘锚山’和‘京畿山’，现在都位于战线以北”了。
    尽管美国的将军们还可以对自己的失败装聋作哑，但敌人的士兵们对朝鲜战场上的军事现实，却承认得痛快得多。美军第三师的上士布莱德雷一九五一年就在朝鲜作过战，六月十一日他承认“我从来没有看到过像昨夜那样的炮火”。新闻封锁下的美方报道，依旧透露出被打败的美军士兵狼狈不堪：美军第三师的一个士兵被打得连连呼叫道：“上帝呵，上帝呵，保佑我的身体吧！”美方记者形容他们是“被打垮的美国步兵的奇怪队伍”。这是些什么形状的队伍呢？据美方记者的报道是：有人“匐匍爬行”、“跌跌冲冲”、“光着脚跑”、“惊魂未定”、一下子“被吓得逃跑十八小时”……这就是好战分子在朝鲜战争中所依赖的主要赌本：美国陆军参谋长柯林斯近日所夸耀的“在美国军事历史中是无比的”第八军步兵今天的像貌。
    好战分子原来是依赖地面上“强大的”“炮火优势”来支援他们的步兵，以图使战线向北移动的，但是，美国通讯社描写今年六月初旬在朝鲜战场上的事实是：朝中方面“使用了朝鲜战争三年历史中最大数量的炮弹”；据美联社统计：“从六月一日到十五日越过前线落在联军地面的炮弹竟达七十五万九千四百三十七发。以前在三十天中的最高记录发生在一九五二年十月”，那时朝中部队共“发射了六十五万二千二百八十四发。”美方自恃其“炮火优势”的吹嘘现在是听不见了，听见的是美军士兵波斯卡蒂这样的叫唤，他诉苦道：“共方的迫击炮使我变得老了。我将要在芝加哥的大街上伏在地下往前爬，让人家看起来觉得稀奇古怪——这完全是习惯成自然哩！”好一副畏缩的神态！
    在前年十一月议定军事分界线的时候，美国军方人士企图依赖的是他们的所谓“空中优势”，以便于向我朝中方面进行军事讹诈；但在今年五月底，曾指挥过美国第五航空队的巴克斯中将也得出结论道：“‘空中优势’并没有、并且也不可能打垮”朝中部队。好，“空中优势”的王牌也显得暗淡了！我们这时能听见的，是美军下士玛赛和士兵尹格拉姆对美联社记者埋怨式的谈话。他们在西线挨打的地堡内“度日如年”、“很感不耐”，于是就谈道：“在朝鲜呆上三十秒钟，都觉得时间太长”，“我希望他们用喷气式飞机把我运回国去。”
    这就是朝鲜战线上今天的变化。
    这种显明的对美李军十分不利的军事情势的变化，使得伦敦《泰晤士报》在五月底这样说：“今日朝鲜的军事情况”给了朝中方面“一些自我庆贺的理由”。当然，问题还不在于“自我庆贺”；问题是谁能够回答李伪军中一个美国顾问的话呢？他纳闷地说道：“我们正在设法调查什么东西在使我们受创，并且受到什么程度。”真的，要是了解了这一些，对于美国的军事冒险家与高级决策人，不是没有益处的。那么，侵略者所以受创并且受创到如此程度的原因何在呢？那就是因为：“任何不顾朝鲜人民的权利和意愿，妄想以武力解决朝鲜问题的企图，是必然要失败的。”（人民日报六月二十五日社论）
    现在连美国的一部分官员和观察家，也不可能得出另一个结论了。如美国前驻印度大使鲍尔士近日承认道：“朝鲜战争现在已经告诉我们，有顽强意志的亚洲军队是不能用按电钮的方法来击败的。”《华尔街日报》的专栏作者约瑟夫·伊凡斯说：“尽管朝鲜战争带来了各种痛苦和悲剧，但是它能够作为将来决定政策方面有益的经验教训，如果美国至少能够在一旦发生类似斗争的时候认清某些事情是干不得的。……”
    ——这些话说得不错，让那些正在设法调查自己受创原因的美国军事冒险家们牢牢地将它们记住吧！＊＊＊＊＊＊
