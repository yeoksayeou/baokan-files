    Farmers in Mountainous Areas of Shouyang County Request the People's Government to Purchase Surplus Grain
    Liu Peijian of the Shouyang County People's Government, Shanxi Province, writes: Guangyang Village and Shanglongquan area in Shouyang County are mountainous areas with inconvenient transportation. Local farmers urgently need to sell their surplus grain, but the local grain bureau and supply and marketing cooperatives have not paid attention to this issue. Although Guangyang Village has a distribution point of the supply and marketing cooperative that sells goods once every five days and also purchases grain, the purchasing method is limited to barter. Farmers want to exchange grain for some cash for small expenses, they have to go to the distant Xiyang Dianshang Village, and it is still very difficult to sell. Farmers universally request the People's Government to find a way to solve this problem. In addition, in recent years, local farmers have urgently requested to plant kenaf to increase income and plant alfalfa as livestock feed and fertilizer, but they lack seeds. Regarding the issue of alfalfa seeds, our county has repeatedly requested instructions from the higher-level People's Government; the Shouyang County Farm also sent people to the province, but no reply has been received. Recently, the alfalfa sowing period is approaching, and the Yuci Administrative Office has only issued a notice to collect statistics on the local demand for alfalfa seeds.

### 寿阳县山区农民要求人民政府收购余粮

    寿阳县山区农民要求人民政府收购余粮
    山西寿阳县人民政府刘培健来信：寿阳县广阳村、上龙泉一带是山区，交通不便。当地农民迫切要求出卖余粮，但是当地粮食局及供销合作社一直没有重视这个问题。广阳村虽然有个供销社的分销处，五天卖货一次，也收购粮食，但收购方式仅限于以粮易货。农民们想用粮食换些现款零花，得到较远的昔阳店上村去，并且还很不容易卖出。农民们普遍要求人民政府设法解决这个问题。另外，当地农民近年来迫切要求种植洋麻以增加收入，种植苜蓿用作牲畜饲料和肥料，但缺少种籽。关于苜蓿籽问题，我县曾再三向上级人民政府请示解决；寿阳县农场还派人到省里去，也未得到答复。最近苜蓿下种期快过了，榆次专署才来了个统计当地要求苜蓿籽数量的通知。
