    Mobilize the Nation's Youth to Devote Themselves to the Motherland's Construction
    National Youth Congress Concludes

    (Xinhua News Agency, June 15th) The Second National Youth Congress of the All-China Youth Federation concluded successfully on June 15th. Youth representatives from various regions and fields summarized the achievements of youth work over the past four years and determined the direction of the efforts of Chinese youth during the national construction period. They bid farewell enthusiastically and assured each other that they would do everything in their power to fight for defending the motherland, building the motherland, and defending world peace.

    This congress played a significant role in mobilizing and organizing the broad masses of young people across the country to strive for the gradual realization of national industrialization and the gradual transition to a socialist society. After the congress's speeches and group discussions, the representatives expressed with full confidence that during the period of national construction, they must contribute their strength to the country from different positions with unwavering spirit and fearlessness of difficulties, together with the people of the whole country, and fulfill the tasks assigned to them by the motherland.

    This congress strongly demonstrated the unprecedentedly strong unity of young men and women of all regions, nationalities, democratic classes, democratic parties, different religious beliefs, and different occupations in our country under the banner of Mao Zedong. At the congress, the representatives reported the glorious achievements of the youth in the great cause of defending and building the motherland, reported the leapfrog progress of the youth under the diligent cultivation of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government, and celebrated the happy life of the Chinese youth of all ethnic groups growing up in the era of Mao Zedong. The representatives unanimously pointed out that all the achievements and happiness of the youth are inseparable from the leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong and the Chinese Communist Party, and are inseparable from the superiority of the people's democratic state system and social system. All the representatives deeply felt the greatness and loveliness of the motherland, and saw the infinitely bright future ahead of the Chinese youth.

    This congress fully demonstrated the internationalist unity between Chinese youth and youth from other countries. During the congress, Piero Pieralli, Secretary of the World Federation of Democratic Youth, and youth representatives from the Soviet Union, North Korea, Vietnam, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, Mongolia, Indonesia, Britain, France, and Australia extended congratulations to the congress. At the same time, the congress also received congratulatory messages from the International Student Union, youth organizations and youth from Romania, Hungary, and Britain. These congratulatory speeches and messages expressed the celebration of the great peaceful construction being carried out by Chinese youth and the entire Chinese people by youth from various countries, which further encouraged the firm belief of Chinese youth in building their own motherland and defending world peace.

    Today, in the main hall of Huai Ren Tang, the lounges on both sides, and the lawn in the backyard, the representatives shuttled back and forth, busy exchanging souvenirs and inscribing each other's commemorative albums. Everywhere you could hear such words: "The brilliance of Mao Zedong will forever illuminate our progress!", "I wish you new achievements," "I wish you to study hard," "I wish you good health." From today onwards, the representatives will rush to various fronts to fight for new achievements.

    Before the closing of the congress, Gao Yubao, a representative of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, a new cultural warrior, and eleven other representatives from other fields, including Huang Jingui, Zhang Xihua, Wang Guangying, Liu Deyuan, Yu Yongzhong, Zhu Xiucheng, Luan Quanxun, Zhang Xianlu, He Jiahe, and Song Xinghua, spoke at the congress.

    When the executive chairman Xu Xing announced that the Soviet Lenin Communist Youth League presented each representative and observer attending the congress with a "Soviet Lenin Communist Youth League Badge," the entire audience stood up and cheered thunderously, paying tribute to the Soviet youth representatives, demonstrating the ever-strengthening fraternal friendship between the people and youth of China and the Soviet Union. This glorious gift further encouraged Chinese youth to learn from the great Soviet youth and emulate the Soviet youth.

    Amidst warm applause, the congress unanimously passed the resolution on Comrade Liao Chengzhi's report on "Fighting to Defend the Motherland and Build the Motherland," adopted the revised Constitution of the All-China Democratic Youth Federation, and passed the resolution on "Strengthening Sino-Soviet Friendship and Cooperation, Learning from the Soviet Union, and Joining the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association as a group member." The congress elected Liao Chengzhi and 112 others as members of the Second Committee of the All-China Democratic Youth Federation and 28 alternate members. The congress also elected representatives to the Chinese Youth Delegation to the Third World Youth Congress.

    When the congress passed the telegram of tribute to Chairman Mao, the whole audience cheered thunderously and the applause lasted for a long time. Amidst warm applause, the congress passed a telegram of tribute to the World Federation of Democratic Youth.

    At 4 p.m., all the foreign guests attending the congress, at the invitation of the presidium, ascended the rostrum amidst warm applause. Representatives of the children of Beijing presented them with flowers, expressing the great friendship of the Chinese people towards foreign friends. Then, representatives from various delegations and many youth organizations presented flags and gifts to the congress. The music of "The Hearts of the People of the World Are One" and "Unity is Strength" followed. Everyone in the audience clapped, jumped, and shouted "Long live the friendship of youth of all ethnic groups under the banner of Mao Zedong!" "Long live the great unity of the people of the world!"

    Finally, Liu Daosheng delivered the closing speech to the congress. After congratulating the representatives and foreign guests who attended the congress, he pointed out that this congress was a congress of unity, a victorious and advancing congress that mobilized the youth of the whole country to devote themselves to the cause of building the motherland.

    He said that our congress has achieved significant results, that is, in the period when the motherland began to enter the period of planned construction, it has determined the direction of future efforts for the youth movement in our country. He called on the representatives to implement the spirit and resolutions of this congress into the actual actions of millions of young people across the country. Under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, strive with selfless labor, unremitting study, and actively for defending the motherland and building the motherland, for gradually realizing industrialization, and gradually transitioning to a socialist society!

    The five-day Second National Youth Congress of the All-China Youth Federation has thus come to a successful conclusion.

    In the evening, the Central Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League hosted a banquet for all representatives, representatives of the Tibetan Youth Visiting Group, representatives of the Qamdo area Youth Visiting Group, and all foreign guests.
