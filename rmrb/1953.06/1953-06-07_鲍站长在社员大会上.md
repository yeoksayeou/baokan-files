Station Chief Bao at the Members' Meeting
    Fang Qing

    April, the busiest season for spring planting. The members of the Yibentang Village Agricultural Production Cooperative in Zhaoyuan County had just finished planting millet for the day and hadn't even finished dinner when they received a notice from the Agricultural Technology Guidance Station: a meeting to discuss the issue of "short-term contracting."

    This issue was very important. People came to the meeting before they even finished eating.

    What was going on? An hour and a half had passed, and Station Chief Bao was still talking about the "nature of agricultural production cooperatives," "farmers' ideological problems," and "characteristics of the small-scale peasant economy," which he had lectured on countless times during the mutual aid and cooperation training class last winter... and he still hadn't touched on the issue of "short-term contracting."

    Many of the members attending the meeting exhibited many "characteristics of the small-scale peasant economy" when Station Chief Bao criticized the "characteristics of the small-scale peasant economy." Many members completely disregarded "collectivity" and leaned against the wall, fast asleep. Several members even disregarded the meeting's "procedures" and "discipline" and, while Station Chief Bao was elaborating on the "characteristics of the small-scale peasant economy," directly raised questions with strained necks: "Station Chief Bao, what if some people want to withdraw from the cooperative?"

    "Strengthen policy education for them," Station Chief Bao answered clearly, and then continued to talk about his "characteristics." But the farmers' minds were just "stubborn," and they raised another question: "What if education doesn't work, and they still want to withdraw?"

    "Act in accordance with the cooperative's charter," Station Chief Bao said firmly, "Withdrawal from the cooperative is only permitted after the end of an agricultural season."

    "But they want to leave now."

    "Ah! Really..." Station Chief Bao was a little annoyed, "Agricultural production cooperatives are democratically managed, the minority obeys the majority, the decision should be made at a members' meeting!"

    "Station Chief, he not only wants to withdraw from the cooperative, but he also wants to leave this village altogether!"

    "Don't give him a household registration transfer certificate!" Station Chief Bao's face was flushed with anger.

    Those few members' "problems" were "resolved," and they fell silent.

    The meeting place returned to calm. Occasional muffled snores came from the foot of the wall.

    鲍站长在社员大会上
    方青
    四月，春耕最紧张的季节。肇源县一本堂村农业生产合作社的社员们种了一天谷子，晚饭还没有吃完，就接到了农业技术指导站的通知：开会研究“短期包工”问题。
    这问题很重要。人们不等吃完饭就来开会了。
    怎么回事呢？时间过去一个半钟头了，鲍站长还在说着去年冬天互助合作训练班上讲过不知多少遍的“农业生产合作社的性质”、“农民的思想问题”和“小农经济特点”……，再也不谈到“短期包工”的问题。
    参加会的不少社员，在鲍站长批判“小农经济特点”时，就表现了不少“小农经济特点”。好多社员根本不管什么“集体性”，就靠在墙上睡起大觉来了。有几个社员竟不管会议的“程序”和“纪律”，在鲍站长详细阐述“小农经济特点”时，竟直着脖子提出问题：“鲍站长，有的人要退社，怎么办？”
    “对他加强政策教育。”鲍站长明确地回答了，接着便又继续讲他的“特点”。可是农民们的脑筋就是“死”，又提出问题：“教育也不行，他还是要退呢？”
    “按社章办事。”鲍站长坚决地说：“退社需在一个农业季节终了之后。”
    “他现在就要走。”
    “唉！真是……”鲍站长有点恼火，“农业生产合作社是民主管理，少数服从多数，开社员大会决定呀！”
    “站长，他不光想退社，干脆想离开这个村！”
    “不给他起户口迁移证！”鲍站长的脸都气得发青了。
    那几个社员的“问题”“解决”了，不作声了。
    会场恢复了平静。墙脚下偶而传来一声声压抑的鼾声。
