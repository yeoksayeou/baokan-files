With the correct leadership of Party and government at all levels and the support of the people of the whole country, the disaster situation in East China has stopped developing except for a few areas, the masses' enthusiasm for production is becoming more stable, and production and disaster relief work is gradually unfolding.

Since last winter, Anhui, Jiangsu, Shandong and other places have successively suffered from natural disasters such as cold waves, late frosts, insects, and hail. Wheat has been severely affected, and some early spring crops have also suffered some losses. After the disaster occurred, the Party and government leading organs actively led the farmers to rescue wheat and sow autumn crops. After rescue, the wheat generally turned from yellow to green and was budding and heading. The wheat in Shandong, where the disaster was less severe, can still produce no less than last year. In the Tengxian Prefecture, which was more severely affected, wheat still has 60% to 70% of its yield. In the disaster area of northern Jiangsu, the average wheat yield is about 50%.

While actively leading farmers to save wheat and protect autumn crops, Party and government leading organs at all levels have also promptly distributed a large amount of relief grain and funds for emergency relief. The Ministry of Food of the Central People's Government has successively transferred a large amount of grain from Inner Mongolia, Southwest, Central South, North China, Northeast and other regions to support the disaster areas in East China. Zhejiang, Fujian and the southern regions of Anhui and Jiangsu provinces will also supply some surplus grain to disaster-stricken areas north of the Yangtze River that need grain.

In order to transport a large amount of grain and seeds to the disaster areas in a timely manner, East China has organized a strong water and land transportation force since the end of April. All employees of the Bengbu Railway Transportation Sub-bureau not only overfulfilled the original transportation task set in April, but also overcame the difficulties of extremely scarce loading and unloading equipment and vehicles crossing the river, and completed the task of rushing to transport 20,000 tons of disaster relief materials.

Due to the continuous arrival of relief grain and the timely supply of supplementary seeds, the replanting work in the disaster areas has been carried out smoothly, and the market grain prices have gradually stabilized. In addition, the Party and government leading organs in the disaster areas have clearly stipulated that production and disaster relief is the overriding central task at present, and have successively sent a large number of cadres to lead farmers to fight against natural disasters. Now the disaster situation has stopped developing, the masses' enthusiasm for production has begun to stabilize, and production and disaster relief work is gradually unfolding. In addition to developing sideline production and collecting substitutes for food in accordance with local conditions, farmers in the disaster-stricken areas of Yancheng Prefecture, Jiangsu Province, are actively carrying out summer farming and summer planting, weeding and pest control, drought resistance and flood prevention, and striving for a bumper harvest in autumn.

At present, the development of production and disaster relief work in East China is still very uneven. Some cadres in some disaster areas have a purely relief-oriented viewpoint, and some disaster victims have the idea of ​​relying on relief. In some areas, when distributing relief grain, the government's relief was not well integrated with the masses' production for self-rescue. Some people sat and ate relief grain, which made the masses very dissatisfied. In some areas, the method of distributing relief grain was incorrect, such as stipulating "no distribution for those with livestock," resulting in a large number of cattle and pigs being slaughtered or sold. In addition, a few cadres in disaster areas did not go deep into the grassroots to understand the situation and conduct specific leadership. At present, the disaster-stricken areas in East China must continue to implement the policy of production for self-reliance, overcome the bureaucratic work style of cadres, go deep into leading the masses, and carry out a comprehensive movement of production for self-reliance.

### 华东各地生产救灾工作逐步开展

    华东各地生产救灾工作逐步开展
    【本报讯】在各级党、政府正确领导和全国人民的支援下，华东各地灾情除个别地区外已停止发展，群众生产情绪日趋稳定，生产救灾工作逐步展开。
    去冬以来，安徽、江苏、山东等地先后遭受寒流、晚霜、虫、雹等自然灾害。小麦受害较为严重，某些早春作物也受到一些损失。在灾情发生后，各地党、政领导机关就积极领导农民抢救小麦和播种大秋作物。经抢救后，一般小麦都由黄转青，打苞出穗。山东受灾较轻的小麦，产量仍可不低于去年。受灾较重的滕县专区，小麦仍有六、七成收。苏北灾区小麦平均可收五成左右。
    各级党、政领导机关在积极领导农民救麦保秋的同时，又及时发放了大批的救济粮、款，进行急救。中央人民政府粮食部先后从内蒙、西南、中南、华北、东北等地区调运大批粮食，支援华东灾区。浙江、福建和安徽、江苏两省的南部地区，也将一部分余粮供给长江以北受灾需粮地区。
    为了及时将大批粮食、种籽运抵灾区，华东各地从四月下旬起即组织强大的水陆运输力量。蚌埠铁路运输分局全体职工，不仅超额完成了四月份原定的运输任务，并克服装卸设备及过江车辆非常缺乏的困难，完成抢运二万余吨救灾物资的任务。
    由于救灾粮的源源运到和补种种籽的及时供应，灾区补种工作得以顺利进行，市场粮价也已逐渐稳定；加以灾区党、政领导机关明确规定生产救灾为当前压倒一切的中心任务，连续派出大批干部，领导农民与自然灾害作斗争，现灾情已停止发展，群众生产情绪开始稳定，生产救灾工作逐步展开。江苏省盐城专区受灾地区农民除因地制宜地开展副业生产和采集代食品外，正积极进行夏耕夏种，锄草除虫，抗旱防涝等工作，争取秋季丰收。
    目前华东生产救灾工作的发展，还是很不平衡的。有的灾区干部存在着单纯救济观点，部分灾民存在着依赖救济的思想。有些地区在发放救济粮时，没有很好地使政府救济与群众的生产自救相结合，有些人坐吃救济粮，群众非常不满。有的地区发放救济粮方法不对，如规定“有牲口的不发”，以致大批耕牛、猪子被宰杀或被卖掉。另外，少数灾区干部没有深入下层了解情况，进行具体领导。目前华东受灾地区必须继续贯彻生产自救的方针，克服干部的官僚主义作风，深入领导群众，开展全面的生产自救运动。
