Xinhua News Agency, June 15th: According to Vietnam News Agency, the Vietnamese People's Army continues to strike in the Red River Delta. From early May to early June, in multiple engagements in Kien An, Ha Nam, Ninh Binh, Nam Dinh and other provinces, the People's Army eliminated seven French military strongholds, annihilated more than 600 enemy troops, and seized a large number of weapons.

　　The major achievements in these engagements include the following: On May 24th, the People's Army eliminated the Thanh Khe and Phu Kim strongholds in Ha Nam Province, annihilating more than 220 enemy troops, including 150 European and African mercenaries. In this battle, two cannons, three mortars, ten machine guns, one hundred submachine guns and rifles, and ten tons of ammunition were captured. In two engagements in late May and early June, the People's Army eliminated five enemy strongholds in Nam Dinh Province, including two training bases for puppet troops—Phu An and Trung Linh. At the same time, the People's Army severely damaged three other enemy strongholds. In these two battles, the People's Army killed and captured many enemy troops and seized sixteen trucks loaded with military supplies.

　　In addition, guerrilla forces have been attacking the enemy's important communication lines, forcing the enemy to hastily dispatch troops for reinforcement, resulting in confusion and passivity.

Xinhua News Agency, June 15th: According to Vietnam News Agency on the 13th, President Ho Chi Minh and the General Headquarters of the Vietnamese People's Army awarded medals and decorations in May to many units of the People's Army's local forces in Kien An Province, North Vietnam, for their meritorious service in combat. The People's Army's local forces in Kien An Province had outstanding achievements in the first few months of this year.

　　The People's Army's local forces in Kien An Province received the First-Class Resistance Medal and the Second-Class Military Merit Medal; one platoon-level cadre received the Third-Class Military Merit Medal; and thirty-seven soldiers and guerrillas received the First-Class to Third-Class Combat Medals. The recipients included several female soldiers.

　　The most outstanding achievement of the People's Army's local forces in Kien An Province was the surprise attack on Kien An City, the provincial capital, in April of this year. In this surprise attack, the People's Army annihilated three enemy companies and burned 3,000 tons of enemy military supplies, ammunition, and tens of thousands of liters of gasoline.
