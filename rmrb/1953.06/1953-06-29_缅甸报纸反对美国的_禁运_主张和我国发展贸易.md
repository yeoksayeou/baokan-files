Xinhua News Agency, Rangoon, 20th: Burmese public opinion opposes the US "embargo" policy and advocates that Burma develop free trade with New China on an equal and mutually beneficial basis.

    Rangoon's "New Light of Burma" said in an editorial entitled "Trade with New China": Burma should immediately develop normal trade with China. The editorial pointed out that New China has great prospects and is connected to Burma by land, making transportation convenient. Trade between the two countries would be of great benefit to Burma. The English-language "Burma New Times" also wrote that it is a particularly important and beneficial thing for Burma to develop trade relations with its great neighbor, New China.

    Many newspapers strongly opposed the US "embargo" and "blockade" policies that harm the Burmese economy. The Mandalay "People's Daily" editorial said that the Commonwealth countries and Burma should no longer rely on "US aid," and should develop equal and mutually beneficial trade to solve their own economic difficulties. The editorial emphasized that Burma should firmly oppose the US "blockade" policy and develop trade with New China. Rangoon's "Progress" said that some countries followed the US "embargo" and "blockade" policies, stopped trade with China, and consequently suffered great losses themselves.

    缅甸报纸反对美国的“禁运”
    主张和我国发展贸易
    【新华社二十日讯】仰光消息：缅甸舆论反对美国的“禁运”政策，主张缅甸与新中国发展平等互惠的自由贸易。
    仰光的“新光报”在“与新中国贸易”为题的社论中说：缅甸应该立即和中国发展正常的贸易。社论指出：新中国前途远大，又与缅甸国土相连，运输便利，两国开展贸易，对缅甸实有莫大利益。英文“缅甸新时代报”也写道：缅甸和伟大的邻邦新中国发展贸易关系是一件特别重要而有利的事情。
    许多报纸都猛烈反对使缅甸经济遭受损害的美国的“禁运”“封锁”政策。曼德勒“人民报”的社论说：英联邦国家和缅甸不应该再倚靠“美援”，应该发展平等互惠贸易来解决本身所遭遇的经济困难。社论强调说：缅甸应该坚决反对美国的“封锁”政策，与新中国发展贸易。仰光“进步报”说：某些国家追随美国的“禁运”“封锁”政策，停止对中国的贸易，因而使本身遭受极大的损失。
