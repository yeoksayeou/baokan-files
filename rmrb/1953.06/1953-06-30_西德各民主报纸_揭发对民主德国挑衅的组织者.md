Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, June 27th (TASS): West German democratic newspapers have exposed the organizers of fascist provocations lurking in Berlin and the German Democratic Republic, pointing out the serious harm to the German people and the cause of peace caused by the provocations carried out by the Bonn revanchists and the American authorities. “German People's Newspaper,” the organ of the "League of Germans for Unity, Peace and Freedom," wrote about the events of these days:
    "These events, like the bloody nights concocted by Goebbels, are the work of fascists." The June 22nd issue of "Free People's Weekly" emphasized that the war-mongers wanted to use the provocations in Berlin to turn the "cold war" against the Soviet Union into a hot war. But they did not succeed. Democratic newspapers fiercely criticized the main provocateurs Adenauer, Kaiser, Luth, etc., who recently called for new adventures and provocations against the working class and the broad masses of the German people. The West German "Truth Daily" on June 23rd published a statement by the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the German Communist Party, calling on West German workers not to be misled, while pointing out that all measures taken by the provocateurs are aimed at inciting hatred towards the East and undermining negotiations between the East and the West.
    Democratic newspapers reported that due to the failure of the fascist provocations in Berlin and the normalization of the situation in the German Democratic Republic, the Adenauer government is doing everything possible to prevent the publication of correct news in West Germany, prohibiting reports on the real causes and culprits of the provocations in Berlin and the German Democratic Republic, and intensifying terrorist measures against democratic forces in West Germany. The police in Hanover confiscated a special issue of "Truth Daily" and raided the newspaper's editorial office. On June 23rd, police officers in Hesse confiscated "Socialist People's Newspaper". West German authorities banned a meeting scheduled to be held in Munich on June 20th to discuss the issue of "Inside Story of the Berlin Events". On June 22nd, the police department prohibited the German Communist Party from holding an election rally in Heidelberg.

    西德各民主报纸
    揭发对民主德国挑衅的组织者
    【新华社讯】据塔斯社柏林二十七日电：西德各民主报纸揭发潜藏在柏林和德意志民主共和国中的法西斯挑衅行为的组织者，指出波恩报复主义者和美国当局进行的挑衅行为对德国人民与和平事业的严重危害。“德国人争取统一和平与自由联盟”机关报“德国人民报”就这些天发生的事件写道：
    “这些事件像戈培尔搞出来的血腥的夜一样，是法西斯分子干的事。”六月二十二日的“自由人民周刊”着重指出，战争贩子想利用在柏林的挑衅，把反对苏联的“冷战”变成热战。但是他们没有成功。各民主报纸激烈抨击主要挑衅者阿登纳、凯撒、鲁特等人，他们最近号召对工人阶级和德国广大人民群众进行新的冒险行动和挑衅行为。六月二十三日西德的“真理报”刊载德国共产党中央委员会书记处的声明，声明号召西德工人不要误入歧途，同时指出，挑衅者的一切措施旨在煽起对东部的憎恨，破坏东西部之间的谈判。
    民主报纸报道，由于柏林法西斯挑衅的失败和德意志民主共和国情况的正常，阿登纳政府就竭尽全力阻挠在西德刊载正确的消息，不许报道在柏林和德意志民主共和国发生挑衅行为的真正原因和祸首，并对西德民主力量加强恐怖手段。警察在汉诺威没收了“真理报”的特刊，并袭击该报的编辑部。六月二十三日，黑森的警官没收了“社会主义人民报”。西德当局禁止了六月二十日要在慕尼黑举行的集会，该会拟定讨论“柏林事件内幕”的问题。六月二十二日，警察局禁止德国共产党在海得尔堡举行竞选大会。
