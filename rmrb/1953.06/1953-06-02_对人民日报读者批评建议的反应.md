Responses to Readers' Criticisms and Suggestions in the People's Daily

    The Nantong Municipal People's Government's Reply Regarding the Handling of People's Letters

    Letter from the Nantong Municipal People's Government of Jiangsu Province: We have seen the letter "The Nantong Municipal People's Government Irresponsibly Handles People's Letters" published in the "Excerpts of Readers' Letters" column of the People's Daily on May 10th. Our reply is as follows: 1. After the "Nantong City Newspaper" reflected the issue of Chen Haobin, we immediately sent people to investigate and contacted the "Nantong City Newspaper" by phone on the same day. When Chen Haobin's problem was verified, we immediately ordered Chen Haobin to conduct a self-criticism and gave him criticism and education. During our investigation, we learned that Zhang Yun, a cadre of the Tienshenggang River Defense Bureau, was also responsible for Chen Haobin's problem, but it was not convenient to directly order Zhang Yun to conduct a self-criticism. When the investigation and handling were completed on March 13, the handling unit drafted a reply to the "Nantong City Newspaper," and suggested in the draft that the River Defense Bureau examine and handle Zhang Yun's mistakes. The comrade who revised the draft in the Secretariat of the Government believed that the suggestion to the River Defense Bureau did not need to go through the newspaper, but could first reply to the "Nantong City Newspaper" and then directly submit opinions to the River Defense Bureau. Therefore, the original draft was changed to: "...has ordered Chen Haobin and Zhang Yun to conduct profound self-criticisms, and given them criticism and education." However, after the Secretariat of the Government issued the draft, it did not inform the handling unit of this situation, nor did it urge the handling unit to notify the River Defense Bureau, so that the River Defense Bureau failed to understand this situation, nor did it order Zhang Yun to conduct a self-criticism. On April 7, the "Nantong City Newspaper" expressed dissatisfaction with the government's reply, and the government made another reply on April 13. 2. Regarding the issue of Chen Yanqiu, after the government sent people to understand the situation, Chen Yanqiu immediately made a verbal self-criticism (the government believed that the problem was not significant and did not need to make a written self-criticism). Therefore, the government replied to the "Nantong City Newspaper" that the comrade had made a self-criticism. When the newspaper asked for Chen Yanqiu's written self-criticism, the government asked Chen Yanqiu to make a supplementary written self-criticism and forwarded it to the newspaper. The above situation shows that the government still has shortcomings in handling people's letters. Especially for the letter about the Chen Haobin incident, although it was handled in appearance, the problem was not completely resolved due to the lack of a responsible spirit in handling people's letters. In addition, the government's reply to the newspaper was not timely and prompt enough. The government will pay attention to overcoming these shortcomings in future work.

    The Yanshan County People's Government's Reply Regarding Mark Qiang's Mistaken Treatment of Criticism

    Letter from the Yanshan County People's Government of Hebei Province: After the "Excerpts of Readers' Letters" column of the People's Daily on May 10th published the letter "Ma, Deputy Section Chief of the Culture and Education Section of Yanshan County, etc. Should Correct the Mistaken Attitude towards Criticism," the responsible comrades of the county immediately talked to Deputy Section Chief Mark Qiang and helped him examine his mistakes. Mark Qiang sincerely accepted the criticism and made a serious written self-criticism, and then made a self-criticism at the cadre meeting of the County Cultural Center. Mark Qiang said in his self-criticism: "Because I have insufficient understanding of the importance of cultural work, and because I emphasized that I am not familiar with cultural work and that there are more people doing cultural work and fewer people doing educational work, I have developed an erroneous tendency to value education over cultural work. But when Comrade Li Chaofeng wrote a draft and put forward his opinions, I did not humbly consider those opinions and examine myself, but only emphasized objective reasons, so that the problem was not resolved and Comrade Li Chaofeng's emotions were dampened. Also, because of my low awareness and poor level of understanding of problems, I thought that Comrade Li Chaofeng's writing was 'making a fuss about nothing,' and said behind Comrade Li Chaofeng's back that he was 'showing off himself,' etc. This is my specific manifestation of suppressing criticism, which is even more wrong. I am determined to correct these mistakes, and I ask comrades to give me more opinions in the future and supervise me so that I can thoroughly correct my mistakes." We agree with Mark Qiang's self-criticism.

    The China Textile Machinery Factory Agrees to Allocate the Steelmaking Furnace to the Steel Factory

    Letter from the Central Ministry of Textile Industry: The opinions of readers Zhou Junhe and Li Chuanxi regarding the inappropriate affiliation of the steelmaking furnace of the Shanghai China Textile Machinery Factory (published in this newspaper on May 18) are correct. The crankshaft and drawing-light ingots and other steel materials required for the factory's automatic loom parts are of high quality. In the past, the quality of steel produced by general steel plants was low, so this furnace was used to refine high-quality steel. However, the annual output of this furnace is about 3,600 tons; while the factory only needs 1,800 tons of steel ingots, plus the task of casting steel for the Ministry of Railways (around train connectors) totaling 800 tons, there can still be more than 1,000 tons left over (plus the excess numbers in production are more than this), resulting in problems in production. Our ministry has contacted the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry several times to accept the factory's steelmaking business, and obtained the consent of the Ministry of Heavy Industry in November last year; however, because the East China Iron and Steel Sub-bureau had not yet received formal instructions from the Ministry of Heavy Industry at that time, the factory was temporarily affected in both production and sales. In early April of this year, the Ministry of Heavy Industry initially allocated the second quarter task to the factory, and the third and fourth quarter tasks are yet to be unified arranged. Although the factory's steelmaking production has initially established a business relationship with the Ministry of Heavy Industry, the problem has not been completely resolved. The factory has studied in detail at the production meeting and believes that if the Ministry of Heavy Industry can fully supply the factory with high-quality steel in the future, then the allocation of this electric furnace equipment to the steel factory would be reasonable. Moreover, this electric furnace equipment is relatively new and can be automatically adjusted, which is suitable for smelting high-grade steel such as alloy steel and tool steel that are most needed in the current industrial construction. It is also inappropriate to use it for refining low-carbon steel ingots now. Therefore, if the higher authorities decide to allocate it, the factory agrees. However, the production tasks before the allocation are still hoped to be handed down by the Ministry of Heavy Industry to avoid disconnection; and it is hoped that the Ministry of Heavy Industry will make a decision as soon as possible so that the factory can make necessary preparations in production planning and labor deployment.

    Correcting the Phenomenon of Destroying Forest Trees

    The "Excerpts of Readers' Letters" column on April 13 published three letters from readers continuing to expose the phenomenon of destroying forest trees. Now, the replies from the leadership organs of the relevant areas are published in summary:

    Letter from the Yulin County People's Government of Shaanxi Province: The reader's suggestion that we educate farmers not to cut willow trees and sandy Artemisia in Otog Banner is correct. In 1952, a small number of farmers in our county often went to Otog Banner to destroy the local sandy willows, foggy willows, and sandy Artemisia. After we discovered it, we immediately notified the district and township governments to widely educate the masses to stop this destructive behavior; and we have included this in the county's 1953 work plan. After seeing the reader's suggestion, in addition to making arrangements for this again at the conference for inspecting spring plowing work (attended by responsible comrades from the districts) held in April, we also issued instructions to the district and township governments bordering the Ikh Ju League Autonomous Region, requiring them to further educate the masses to strictly abide by the regulations on closing sand and cultivating grass and strictly prohibiting the cutting of sandy willows, foggy willows, and sandy Artemisia, in order to benefit production and prevent wind and sand, and consolidate the unity of the Mongolian and Han peoples.

    Letter from the Shibu District Committee of the Communist Party of China, Xiangshan County, Zhejiang Province: The reader's criticism of the Jinxing Township cadres in our district, Cai Meiying, for arbitrarily approving farmers to cut pine trees, etc., is true. The serious phenomenon of destroying forest trees in our district is due to the fact that the district leadership lacks sufficient understanding of the important significance of afforestation and forest protection, and lacks education for cadres. We should be responsible for this, and we are determined to correct this mistake and strengthen forest protection work in the future.

    Letter from the Construction Section of the Linxiang County People's Government of Hunan Province: After a series of mountain fires occurred in our county in March, we immediately organized forestry cadres to go to the countryside to investigate and conduct forest protection education to the masses, and strengthened the forest protection and fire prevention organization. Those who set fire to the forest have been handed over to the court for handling. Among them, a lawless landlord who conspired to sabotage has been sentenced to three years in prison; and we have announced the handling situation to the whole county to educate the masses.

    In addition, regarding the issue of "Mianzhu Girls' Middle School wantonly felling forest trees in violation of government regulations during the school construction project" published in the "Excerpts of Readers' Letters" column on March 23, the Mianyang Prefectural People's Supervision Office of Sichuan Province has reported the results of the investigation and handling: Li Haixin, the director of teaching affairs of the school, should bear the main responsibility for the destruction of forest trees, and it was decided to give him a demerit punishment. Principal Fu Pingxiang and other relevant personnel were criticized. As for the mistakenly cut and injured trees of farmers, the losses should be compensated at the price immediately. Regarding the issue of some farmers in the mountainous areas of Weining County, Guizhou, indiscriminately cutting down forest trees, the Weining County People's Government replied in a letter saying: The county's forest protection work is indeed not done well, and cadres have now been educated to widely conduct forest protection education to the masses, and forest protection organizations have been established with emphasis.

### 对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    对人民日报读者批评建议的反应
    南通市人民政府对处理人民来信问题的答复
    江苏省南通市人民政府来信：五月十日人民日报“读者来信摘要”栏刊载的“南通市人民政府对待人民来信不负责任”一信，我们看到了。今答复如下：一、“南通市报”反映陈浩斌的问题后，我们当天便派人去调查，同时在电话上和“南通市报”社联系过。陈浩斌的问题被证实时，我们当即责令陈浩斌作了检讨，并给予批评教育。我们在调查过程中，了解到陈浩斌的问题，天生港江防局干部张云也有责任，但不便直接责成张云检讨。三月十三日调查处理结束时，即由经办单位拟稿复“南通市报”社，稿内并建议江防局检查处理张云的错误。稿件经本府秘书处复核，改稿同志认为对江防局的建议不必通过报社，可以先复“南通市报”社，再直接向江防局提出意见，于是把原稿改成：“……已责令陈浩斌及张云作深刻检讨，并给予批评教育。”但本府秘书处发稿后，没有把这情况告知经办单位，并督促经办单位通知江防局，以致江防局未能了解这情况，也没有责成张云作检讨。四月七日“南通市报”社表示不满意本府的答复，本府于四月十三日才再次作了答复。二、陈雁秋的问题，本府派人前往了解后，陈雁秋当即口头作了检讨（本府认为问题不大，不必作书面检讨），因此本府答复“南通市报”社说该同志已作了检讨。待报社索取陈雁秋的书面检讨时，本府才又让陈雁秋补作书面检讨转寄给报社。上述情况，说明本府对处理人民来信的工作仍然是有缺点的。尤其对陈浩斌事件的来信，从现象上看虽然作了处理，但由于对待人民来信工作的负责精神不够，以致问题未能得到彻底解决。此外，本府对报社的答复，也不够及时迅速。这些缺点，本府在今后工作中当注意克服。
    盐山县人民政府关于马克强错误地对待批评的答复
    河北省盐山县人民政府来信：五月十日人民日报“读者来信摘要”栏刊载“盐山县文教科马副科长等应纠正对待批评的错误态度”一信后，本县负责同志立即找马克强副科长谈话，帮助他检查错误。马克强诚恳接受批评，并严肃地作了书面检讨，继又在县文化馆干部会议上作了检讨。马克强检讨说：“我由于对文化工作的重要性认识不足，由于强调自己对文化工作不熟悉和认为作文化工作的人较多而作教育工作的人较少等等，因而产生了重教育轻文化工作的错误倾向。但当李超峰同志写稿提出意见后，我不是虚心地考虑那些意见并检查自己，而是光强调客观原因，以致问题没有得到解决，并打击了李超峰同志的情绪。又由于自己觉悟不高，认识问题的水平差，以致认为李超峰同志的写稿是‘小题大作’，背后说李超峰同志‘显示自己’等等。这是我压制批评的具体表现，更为错误。我下定决心改正这些错误，并要求同志们今后多对我提意见，监督我，使我彻底改正错误。”我们同意马克强的检讨。
    中国纺织机器厂同意把炼钢炉调拨给钢铁厂
    中央纺织工业部来信：读者周钧禾、李传栻关于上海中国纺织机器厂炼钢炉隶属不适当的意见（刊五月十八日本报）是正确的。该厂自动织机机件曲轴及拉光洋元等所需钢材品质较高，过去一般钢厂生产的钢质量低，故用此炉自炼优质钢。但该炉全年产量约有三千六百吨；而本厂所需钢锭仅一千八百吨，加上接受铁道部铸钢任务（绕火车连接器）计八百吨，尚可剩余一千吨以上（加上生产上超额数字尚不止此），以致生产中发生问题。我部曾数度洽请中央重工业部接受该厂炼钢业务，去年十一月间并已获得重工业部同意；唯因华东钢铁分局当时未获重工业部正式指令，故使该厂一时在生产及销售上皆受影响。今年四月初重工业部已初步分配给该厂第二季度任务，第三、四季度任务则尚待统一布置。该厂炼钢生产虽已初步与重工业部接上业务关系，但并未彻底解决问题。该厂曾在生产会议上详细研究，认为今后重工业部如能充分供给该厂优质钢材，则此项电炉设备自以调拨给钢铁厂为合理。且此项电炉设备较为新式，可自动调节，适宜于冶炼当前工业建设中最需要的合金钢及工具钢等高级钢材，现在炼低炭钢锭也属使用不当。故如上级决定调拨，该厂是同意的。但调拨以前的生产任务，仍希重工业部负责交下，以免脱节；并望重工业部及早作出决定，俾该厂能在生产计划及劳动调配上作必要的准备。纠正破坏林木的现象
    四月十三日“读者来信摘要”栏发表了读者继续揭发破坏林木现象的三封来信，现将有关地区领导机关的答复摘要发表于后：
    陕西省榆林县人民政府来信：读者提出要我们教育农民不要到乌审旗砍伐柳木沙蒿的建议是正确的。一九五二年本县有少数农民经常到乌审旗破坏该地沙柳、雾柳、沙蒿。我们发现后即通知各该区、乡政府广泛教育群众，制止这种破坏行为；并将此列入本县一九五三年工作计划中。看到读者建议后，我们除在四月间召开的检查春耕工作会议上（区的负责同志参加）对此再作了布置外，又给靠近伊克昭盟自治区地界的各区、乡政府发出指示，要求进一步教育群众严格遵守封沙育草及严禁砍伐沙柳、雾柳和沙蒿的规定，以利生产而防风沙，并巩固蒙汉人民的团结。
    中共浙江省象山县石浦区委会来信：读者批评我区金星乡乡干部蔡梅英任意批准农民砍伐松木等情况属实。我区发生破坏林木的严重现象，原因是区领导方面对育林护林工作的重要意义认识不足，对干部缺乏教育。我们对此应该负责，今后决心纠正这个错误，加强护林工作。
    湖南临湘县人民政府建设科来信：三月份我县发生一连串的烧山事件后，我们即组织了林业干部下乡调查，并向群众进行护林教育，加强护林防火组织。放火烧林者已交法院办理，其中一个阴谋破坏的不法地主已判处三年徒刑；我们并将处理情况布告全县，以教育群众。
    此外，三月二十三日“读者来信摘要”栏发表的关于“绵竹女中在建校工程中违反政府规定滥伐林木”问题，四川省绵阳专署人民监察处已来信报告调查处理结果：该校教导主任李海鑫对破坏林木事件应负主要责任，决定给予记过处分，校长傅平骧及其他有关人员受到批评。至于误砍、误伤农民的树木，应即照价赔偿损失。关于贵州威宁县山区某些农民乱砍林木问题，威宁县人民政府来信答复说：该县护林工作确实做得不好，现在已教育干部广泛向群众进行护林教育，并重点建立护林组织。
