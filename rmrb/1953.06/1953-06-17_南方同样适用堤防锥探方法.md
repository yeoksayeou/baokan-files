    The cone penetration method for dikes is an extremely effective method for eliminating hidden dangers and enhancing the flood resistance of dikes. This method involves drilling into the dike with a steel wire three to ten meters long and about one centimeter in diameter, judging the solidity of the dike soil or the presence of hidden dangers based on the feeling when the cone is inserted. If a thicker cone is used, sand can also be poured into the cone hole to check for hidden dangers (if there are hidden dangers, a lot of sand can be poured in). Since the Yellow River dikes began using this method to inspect the dike body, more than 60,000 caves have been discovered, many dike-damaging animals have been caught, and some of the discovered caves could accommodate forty or fifty people, which would pose a risk of dike failure once floods come. After discovery, filling and compacting the soil strengthened the dike body. However, in the past, people were unsure whether this method was feasible in the South.

    In September 1952, Jiangxi Province started a training class and invited Yellow River cone penetration models to promote the cone penetration method. In the six months up to February of this year, more than 20,000 meters of dikes and embankments were cone-penetrated in Jiangxi, with more than 43,000 cone holes, discovering 264 large and small caves, including old culverts, tree stumps, groundhog holes, tombs, bunkers, trenches, water wells, and manure pits, which were immediately repaired, strengthening the quality of some embankments. In the Fu Dayou embankment in Nanchang City, which is known as the most solid in the province, two major hidden dangers were also found by cone penetration: on January 6, a cave that could be filled with 176 jin of sand was found in the Mincun section, and this section of the embankment had experienced danger during the 1952 flood season; on January 29, a large leak was found at the Hugong Temple, which could be filled with 495 jin of sand.

    The Pearl River Water Conservancy Engineering General Bureau and the Guangdong Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau also started training classes. In one month of on-site learning, a total of 74 hidden dangers in the dike body were discovered. The cone penetration class was warmly welcomed by the masses. They discovered a leak in the Shijiao enclosure of the Beijiang River that caused backflow during floods, and in the 15-meter dike section of the Ninantang of the Fengle enclosure of the West River, they discovered seven rotten coffins, and in the Shahe enclosure of the Dongjiang River, they also found two rotten tree root holes that caused water leakage. In the past, these were the most troublesome and unsolvable problems during flood prevention. After the hidden dangers were excavated, the masses, seeing the holes under the dikes, unanimously reflected: "It's been leaking for decades, it turns out these things are the cause! Now that we have learned this technique, we are more confident in flood prevention."

    The achievements of Jiangxi and Guangdong provinces in learning cone penetration work prove that the Yellow River's method of cone penetrating dikes can be used not only in the North, but also in the South. All regions should seriously learn from this advanced experience, carefully inspect dikes, eliminate hidden dangers as early as possible, and strive for greater achievements in flood prevention work.

### 南方同样适用堤防锥探方法

    南方同样适用堤防锥探方法
    锥探堤防是消除隐患、增强堤防抗御洪水能力的极为有效的方法。这方法是用长三公尺到十公尺、直径约一公分的钢丝，钻进堤内，凭下锥时的感觉，来判断堤土的虚实或有无隐患。如用较粗的锥，还可用向锥眼内灌沙的方法，来检查有无隐患（如果有隐患，就能灌进很多沙子）。黄河大堤开始采用这个方法检查堤身以来，共发现六万多个洞穴，捉了许多害堤动物，发现的洞穴有的可以住宿四、五十人，一旦洪水来临，就有决堤危险。发现后填土夯实，就加强了堤身的强度。可是，这个方法在南方是否可行，过去人们都没有把握。
    一九五二年九月间，江西省开办了一个训练班，请黄河锥探模范去推广锥探方法。到今年二月为止的六个月中，在江西共锥探了堤圩两万多公尺，锥眼四万三千多个，发现大小洞穴二百六十四处，其中有老涵管、树兜、地狗洞、坟墓、碉堡、战壕、水井、粪窖等，立即加以修补，加强了部分圩堤的质量。在南昌市向称全省最坚固的富大有圩，也锥出了两个大的隐患：一月六日，在闽村段探出了一个灌沙一百七十六市斤的洞穴，这段圩在一九五二年汛期曾经出险；一月二十九日又在胡公庙锥出一个大漏洞，灌沙四百九十五市斤。
    珠江水利工程总局和广东省水利局也开办了训练班。在实地学习的一个月中，共发现堤身隐患七十四处。锥探班受到群众热烈欢迎。他们在北江石角围发现了在洪水时背河冒水的漏洞，在西江丰乐围泥南塘十五公尺堤段内，发现了七口腐烂棺材，在东江沙河围也锥出了两个冒水的腐烂树根洞。在过去，这些都是在防汛时候最伤脑筋和无法解决的问题。在隐患开挖出来以后，群众看见了堤下那些窟窿，都一致反映说：“漏了几十年，原来就是这些东西作怪！我们学会了这个技术，防汛的时候也有了把握。”
    江西和广东两省学习锥探工作的成绩，证明了黄河锥探堤防的方法，不仅在北方能用，在南方也同样可以用。各地都应认真学习这个先进经验，认真检查堤防，及早消灭隐患，争取防汛工作有更大的成绩。
