    Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: According to Vietnam News Agency's Sino-Vietnamese News: In the struggle against the French invading forces' destruction of the harvest, Vietnamese farmers in the Trung Viet provinces of Quang Binh, Quang Tri, and Thua Thien have victoriously completed their summer harvest.
    In order to stop the French army's atrocities in destroying the summer harvest, at the beginning of the harvest season in May, the local People's Army and guerrillas continuously launched attacks on their own initiative, besieging the enemy troops in their strongholds, making it impossible for them to detach themselves to destroy the harvest.
    Under the protection of the people's armed forces, farmers in Thua Thien province are busily harvesting grain. For example, men, women, and children in Quang Dien County organized themselves to harvest grain in the fields during the day; at night, strong armed farmers went deep into the vicinity of the enemy's strongholds to harvest. Thanks to the heroic efforts of the farmers, Guanghe Township in Quang Dien County completed the harvesting of approximately 150 hectares of grain in less than two weeks.
    In Quang Binh province, the French invaders frequently used airplanes to threaten and strafe farmers in an attempt to hinder the harvest. However, while persisting in the harvesting work, the farmers dug thousands of air-raid shelters, temporarily taking shelter in the air-raid shelters when enemy planes came to wreak havoc. A farmer's wife in Le Thuy County even created a method of first splashing water on the ground and then digging a hole, which doubled the speed of digging air-raid shelters.
    In Quang Tri province, the enemy troops attempted to prohibit farmers from harvesting and loot farmers' grain, but they were defeated by the struggle of the local farmers.
    At present, almost all the ripe grain in the enemy-occupied areas and guerrilla areas of Quang Binh, Quang Tri, and Thua Thien has been harvested. Farmers in the areas that have completed harvesting immediately launched a competition to pay agricultural taxes, determined to hand over the best grain to the people's government in the shortest possible time.
    In addition to carefully storing the grain in enemy-occupied areas, "not letting a single grain of rice fall into the hands of the enemy," farmers are also actively paying agricultural taxes to the people's government. Farmers in four enemy-occupied townships in Guangtian County, Thua Thien Province, have paid 22 tons of grain in agricultural taxes to the people's government.

    Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: According to Vietnam News Agency: Before the arrival of the rainy season and flood season, the Vietnamese people are busily reinforcing river dikes in the river-laced Red River Delta to prevent floods.
    Farmers in Ningjiang and Qingmian counties in Haiyang province had completed 80 percent of the Luhe River dike reinforcement project by mid-May and are preparing to complete the entire project before the flood season. They organized themselves to take turns on the dikes, combining dike repair work with the care of summer crops.
    People in the Yongfu province behind enemy lines, near Hanoi, persisted in completing dike repair work despite enemy shelling. They said, "If we can subdue the floods, we will have rice to eat; if we get enough rice, we can kill more enemies." Inspired by the spirit of heroism, the people of Yongfu Province have now completed the repair and reinforcement of river dikes throughout the province and have built a new dike in Anlan County.
    While the people in the enemy-held areas were repairing the dikes, the people in the liberated areas offered them lanterns, baskets, hemp ropes, and other materials to support them, and wrote letters to congratulate and encourage them to complete the dike repair work and strive for a bumper harvest.

### 在主动出击的人民军的保护下  越南中部完成夏收  海阳永福等省农民加固堤防

    在主动出击的人民军的保护下
    越南中部完成夏收
    海阳永福等省农民加固堤防
    【新华社讯】据越南通讯社中越讯：在反对法国侵略军队破坏收获的斗争中，中越广平、广治、承天地区的越南农民已经胜利完成夏收。
    为了制止法军破坏夏收的暴行，在五月收获季开始的时候，当地人民军地方部队和游击队就不断主动出击，把敌军围困在据点里，使他们无法抽身出来破坏收获。
    在人民武装的保卫下，承天省农民紧张地抢收谷物。例如该省广田县的男女老幼都组织起来，白天到田里收割谷物；在晚上，就由身强力壮的武装农民深入到敌人的据点附近进行抢收。由于农民们的英勇努力，广田县广和乡在不到两个星期的时间中，就把约一百五十公顷的谷物收割完毕。
    在广平省，法国侵略者经常用飞机来威胁和扫射农民，企图阻挠收割。但是，农民们在坚持收割工作的同时，挖了几千个防空洞，在敌机来肆虐的时候就暂时避到防空洞里。黎水县的一个农妇并创造了先把水泼在地上然后挖洞的办法，使挖防空洞的速度提高了一倍半。
    在广治省，敌军企图禁止农民收割，抢劫农民的谷物，但在当地农民的斗争下，都遭到了失败。
    目前，广平、广治、承天的敌占区和游击区的成熟的谷物差不多已全部收割完毕。已收割完的地区的农民立即展开了缴纳农业税的竞赛，决心在最短期间内把最好的谷子缴给人民政府。
    敌占区的农民除了把谷物小心收藏起来，“不让一粒米落到敌人手里”以外，他们也在积极向人民政府缴纳农业税。承天省广田县四个敌占乡的农民已向人民政府缴纳了二十二吨谷子的农业税。
    【新华社讯】据越南通讯社讯：在雨季洪水期来到以前，越南人民正在河流错纵的红河三角洲上紧张地加固河堤，预防水灾。
    海阳省宁江和清冕县的农民已在五月中旬完成了禄河河堤加固工程的百分之八十，并准备在洪水期前完成全部工程。他们组织起来轮流上堤，把修堤和照顾夏季作物的工作很好地结合起来。
    邻近河内的永福省敌后地区人民冒着敌军的炮轰，坚持完成修堤工作。他们说，如果我们能把洪水制服，我们将有大米吃；如果我们得到足够的米，我们就能杀死更多的敌人。在英雄主义精神的鼓舞下，永福省人民现在已完成全省河堤的修补和加固工作，并在安兰县修筑了一条新河堤。
    在敌后地区人民修补河堤的时候，解放区人民纷纷以灯笼、筐子、麻绳等支援他们，并写信祝贺和鼓励他们完成修堤工作，争取丰收。
