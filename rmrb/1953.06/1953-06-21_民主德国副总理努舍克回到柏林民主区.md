Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, June 20th: According to the German News Agency, Berlin, June 19th, Otto Nuschke, Deputy Prime Minister of the German Democratic Republic and Chairman of the Christian Democratic Union, regained his freedom on the afternoon of June 19th. The decisive demands made by Soviet High Commissioner in Germany, Ambassador Semyonov, together with the government of the German Democratic Republic, and the enormous protest movement of all honest, peace-loving Germans, forced the American military authorities to release Nuschke.

Otto Nuschke was escorted to the sector boundary by American officials. He said that American officers had repeatedly attempted to obtain "confessions" from him that would slander the Soviet Union and the government of the German Democratic Republic. They also made a despicable attempt to get him to agree to stay in West Berlin.

    民主德国副总理努舍克回到柏林民主区
    【新华社二十日讯】据德意志通讯社柏林十九日讯：德意志民主共和国副总理、基督教民主联盟主席努舍克在六月十九日下午恢复了自由。苏联驻德高级专员谢麦诺夫大使与德意志民主共和国政府所作的决定性的要求和所有诚实的、爱好和平的德国人的巨大抗议运动，迫使美国军事当局不得不释放努舍克。
    奥托·努舍克由美国官员们护送到区边界线。他说：美国军官们曾一再企图要从他那里得到污蔑苏联和德意志民主共和国政府的“坦白”。他们并且卑鄙地企图使他同意留在西柏林。
