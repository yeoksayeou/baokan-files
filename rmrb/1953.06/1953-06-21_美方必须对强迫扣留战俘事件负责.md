Only ten days after the signing of the agreement on the repatriation of prisoners of war in the Korean armistice negotiations, a serious incident occurred in which the U.S. side condoned the Syngman Rhee group's serious sabotage of this agreement. On the 18th, 19th, and 20th of this month, with the repeated connivance of the U.S. military headquarters, the Syngman Rhee group brazenly forced nearly 26,000 captured personnel of the Korean People's Army, who should have been handed over to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission for custody and processing after the armistice, to leave the U.S. prisoner-of-war camps in Nonsan, Masan, Busan, and other places, and implemented forced retention. The extremely serious nature of this incident is self-evident.

Regarding this blatant serious incident of the Syngman Rhee group's sabotage of the prisoner-of-war repatriation agreement, General Harrison, the chief negotiator for the U.S. side, in a letter to our side's General Nam Il on June 18, even attempted to cover up and shirk responsibility. Harrison's letter described this blatant forced retention of prisoners of war as "escape" by our captured personnel. However, on the same day that the U.S. side sent this letter, Syngman Rhee publicly issued a statement directly admitting that he "ordered the release" of these tens of thousands of prisoners of war. According to reports from American news agencies, after these tens of thousands of prisoners of war were coerced to leave the prisoner-of-war camps by South Korean guards and special agents, they were directly escorted by the Syngman Rhee army to nearby military training bases of the puppet South Korean army "to recruit them into the South Korean army." This completely exposed the illegal actions of the Syngman Rhee group in sabotaging the repatriation agreement and forcibly detaining prisoners of war.

People remember that during the negotiations on the prisoner-of-war issue, our side repeatedly refuted the U.S. side's trick of attempting to forcibly detain prisoners of war under the guise of "voluntary repatriation" and "no forced repatriation," and consistently insisted on the just position of repatriating prisoners of war in accordance with the Geneva Convention and humanitarian principles. Based on this position, the governments of China and North Korea jointly proposed on March 30th and March 31st this year that all prisoners of war not directly repatriated be transferred to neutral countries after the armistice takes effect, in order to ensure a fair resolution of their repatriation. The Korean armistice negotiations were able to resume on the basis of this proposal, and the prisoner-of-war issue that had been hindering the armistice for more than a year was also able to reach an agreement on the basis of this proposal. After this agreement was reached, our side repeatedly reminded the U.S. side that the possibility of so-called "forced repatriation" by our side was fundamentally nonexistent, but the possibility of the U.S. side attempting to forcibly detain prisoners of war still existed seriously. However, instead of trying to prevent the increasing possibility of forced retention, the U.S. side further condoned Syngman Rhee's outrageous actions, making the forced retention of a large number of prisoners of war an undeniable fact of violating the agreement. This further proves that our side's consistent opposition to forced retention of prisoners of war is completely justified, and that the U.S. side's attempt to forcibly detain prisoners of war under the pretext of so-called "no forced repatriation" is a long-planned scheme. Syngman Rhee said in his statement: "Most of the UN forces authorities with whom I have discussed our desire to release these prisoners are sympathetic to us and agree with us in principle." In fact, this forced retention of prisoners of war precisely exposed the U.S. side's fear of handing over prisoners of war who were not directly repatriated to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, fearing that after our side's explanation, these prisoners of war would exercise their right to be repatriated, and that the so-called "voluntary repatriation" and "no forced repatriation" pretext and the real attempt to forcibly detain prisoners of war would ultimately be completely bankrupt.

The entire process of the Syngman Rhee group's deliberate implementation of forced retention of prisoners of war was obviously known to the U.S. military authorities long ago. On June 9, the Syngman Rhee group's "National Assembly" openly passed a resolution declaring that it would "immediately release all Korean prisoners of war who refuse repatriation and send Chinese prisoners of war who refuse to return home to Taiwan." The U.S. military authorities did not take any action to stop this publicly conducted conspiracy to sabotage the prisoner-of-war repatriation agreement, but instead turned a deaf ear and indulged and acquiesced in it. U.S. Brigadier General McGarr, commander of the U.S. prisoner-of-war camp, also admitted in an interview with reporters on the 18th: "We anticipated that something might happen several weeks before the escape incident," but the U.S. military authorities not only did not take any measures, but continued to condone the Syngman Rhee group's arbitrary actions. A United Press International dispatch from Tokyo on the 18th reported: "General Clark's senior staff had anticipated Syngman Rhee's actions," but "the final decision" was for the Syngman Rhee group's army to "continue to serve as guards for the prisoner-of-war camps." What else can this prove other than that the U.S. military authorities completely intentionally indulged and acquiesced in the Syngman Rhee group's attempt to sabotage the prisoner-of-war repatriation agreement and implement forced retention of prisoners of war!

Obviously, any attempt to cover up the U.S.'s attitude of condoning the Syngman Rhee group is useless. A statement issued by the U.S. military headquarters in Tokyo on the 18th said that the American personnel at the prisoner-of-war camp "tried their best to prevent today's mass escape of prisoners of war," but "their efforts were mostly futile." This is completely self-deception. Facts prove that General Clark's U.S. military headquarters, which is responsible for governing all U.S. prisoner-of-war camps, continued to encourage Syngman Rhee to continue recklessly after the incident on the 18th. U.S. Brigadier General McGarr, commander of the U.S. prisoner-of-war camp, even publicly said on the 18th: "If they (referring to the Syngman Rhee group) want to do it again tonight, they can do it." This further aggravated the situation, so that forced retention of prisoners of war continued to occur on the 19th and 20th. This further proves that the "best efforts to prevent" mentioned in the statement of the U.S. military headquarters is a lie; in fact, they not only did not "prevent" it, but "tried their best" to encourage the Syngman Rhee group's actions to violate the agreement. This is all too clear.

In any case, the U.S. military authorities must bear full and absolute responsibility for the Syngman Rhee group's forced retention of prisoners of war. People all know that the so-called United Nations forces commanded by the United States include the Syngman Rhee group's army in South Korea. General Clark also admitted that in the summer of 1950, the Syngman Rhee group had handed over the authority to command the South Korean army during the war to the U.S. military headquarters, so the U.S. military authorities have the full responsibility and must strictly control all actions of the South Korean Syngman Rhee army. Regarding the serious incident of the Syngman Rhee group's forced retention of prisoners of war, the U.S. side must be responsible for immediately taking effective measures, and absolutely no reason should be allowed to shirk responsibility. In a letter to our side's General Nam Il on the 18th, Harrison, the chief negotiator for the U.S. side, only verbally expressed to our side that he would "do his best to recover" the prisoners of war "released" by the Syngman Rhee group; McGarr, commander of the U.S. prisoner-of-war camp, even declared that it was impossible to "capture back" those prisoners of war "released" by the Syngman Rhee group. This irresponsible attitude of the U.S. side is absolutely unacceptable.

According to the agreement on the repatriation of prisoners of war signed by the two delegations in Panmunjom on June 8, the U.S. side has an inescapable responsibility to ensure that all prisoners of war are not forcibly detained. The basic spirit of the agreement on the repatriation of prisoners of war is to ensure that all prisoners of war have the opportunity to exercise their right to be repatriated after the armistice. Paragraph 3 of Article 1 of the agreement on the scope of authority of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission stipulates that for prisoners of war who have not directly exercised their right to be repatriated, "force or threat of force shall not be used to obstruct or compel their repatriation"; Paragraph 4 of Article 2 further stipulates that "all prisoners of war who have not exercised their right to be repatriated after the date on which the Armistice Agreement becomes effective shall be released from the military control and custody of the Detaining Side as expeditiously as practicable, and in any event within sixty (60) days after the date on which the Armistice Agreement becomes effective, and handed over to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission at places in Korea designated by the Detaining Side." Now, when the entire armistice agreement is about to be signed and take effect, the U.S. side is actually condoning and encouraging the Syngman Rhee group to take action to forcibly detain prisoners of war, depriving nearly 26,000 Korean prisoners of war who are not directly repatriated of the opportunity to exercise their right to repatriation. This obviously seriously violates and undermines the provisions of Paragraph 3 of Article 1 in the above agreement between the two sides; if the U.S. side cannot be responsible for recovering the forcibly detained prisoners of war, the U.S. side will not be able to guarantee to fulfill the provision of Paragraph 4 of Article 2 to hand over all prisoners of war who have not directly exercised their right to be repatriated to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission for custody and processing "under any circumstances." Therefore, the responsibility before the U.S. side is to be responsible for recovering all our captured personnel who were forcibly detained by the Syngman Rhee group from the prisoner-of-war camps in Nonsan, Masan, Busan, Sangmudae, and Yeongcheon.

Marshal Kim Il-sung and Commander Peng Dehuai pointed out clearly in their reply to General Clark on June 19: "In view of the unusually serious consequences of this incident, we cannot but ask you: can the United Nations Command control the government and army of South Korea? If not, does the Korean armistice include the Syngman Rhee group? If it does not include them, what guarantee is there for the implementation of the armistice agreement on the South Korean side? If it does include them, then you must be responsible for immediately recovering all 25,952 prisoners of war who are now 'at large,' that is, who have been 'released' and coerced into detention and are being prepared to be incorporated into the South Korean army, and guarantee that similar incidents will never occur again." Obviously, the responsibility for changing this situation now rests entirely with the U.S. side.

### 美方必须对强迫扣留战俘事件负责

    美方必须对强迫扣留战俘事件负责
    朝鲜停战谈判双方签订了关于战俘遣返问题的协议才不过十天，美方竟发生了纵容李承晚集团严重地破坏这一协议的事件。本月十八、十九和二十日，李承晚集团在美军总部一再纵容之下，从论山、马山、釜山等地的美方战俘营中，悍然地强迫停战后应移交中立国遣返委员会看管和处理的朝鲜人民军被俘人员近二万六千名离开战俘营，实行强迫扣留。这一事件的极端严重的性质，是不言而喻的。
    对于李承晚集团这一明目张胆地破坏战俘遣返协议的严重事件，美方谈判首席代表哈利逊将军在六月十八日致我方南日大将的信件中，居然还企图加以掩饰和推卸责任。哈利逊的来信竟然把这样明目张胆的强迫扣留战俘的事件，说成是我方被俘人员的“逃跑”。但是，就在美方发出这一封信的同一天，李承晚已公开发表声明，直认是他“下令释放”这数万战俘的。据美国通讯社的报道，这数万战俘被南朝鲜警卫部队和特务胁迫离开战俘营后，就被李承晚军队直接押解到附近李伪军的军事训练基地，“把他们招募到南朝鲜军去”。这就把李承晚集团破坏遣俘协议、强迫扣留战俘的非法行动和盘托出了。
    人们都记得，在战俘问题的谈判过程中，我方曾
    一再驳斥美方以“自愿遣返”和“不得强迫遣返”为藉口企图强迫扣留战俘的诡计，并一贯坚持必须依据日内瓦公约和人道原则遣返战俘的正义立场。根据这个立场，今年三月三十日、三月三十一日中朝两国政府先后共同建议，在停战生效后将全部未予直接遣返的战俘转交中立国，以保证对他们的遣返问题的公正解决。朝鲜停战谈判在这个建议的基础上才得恢复，一年多以来阻挠停战的战俘问题也是在这个建议的基础上才能达成协议的。在这个协议达成之后，我方并曾反复不断地提醒美方：美方所谓“强迫遣返”的可能性是根本不存在的，倒是美方企图强迫扣留战俘的可能性依然严重存在。可是，美方不仅不去努力防止日益增加的强迫扣留的可能性，反而进一步纵容李承晚采取猖狂行动，使大批战俘被强迫扣留成为无可置辩的破坏协议的事实。这就更加证明我方一贯反对强迫扣留战俘是完全有根据的，而美方以所谓“不得强迫遣返”为藉口来强迫扣留战俘的企图是蓄谋已久的。李承晚在他的声明中就这样说：“凡是我曾和他谈过我们希望释放这些俘虏的大多数联合国军方面的当局人士，都是同情我们并且在原则上赞成我们的。”实际上，这次强迫扣留战俘事件，正是暴露了美方害怕把不直接遣返的战俘交给中立国遣返委员会，惟恐这些战俘经过我方解释后行使其被遣返的权利，使所谓“自愿遣返”和“不强迫遣返”的虚伪藉口和强迫扣留战俘的真实企图最后宣告彻底破产。
    李承晚集团蓄意实行强迫扣留战俘的全部过程，显然是美国军事当局所早已知道的。六月九日，李承晚集团的“国民议会”公然通过一项决议，声言要“立即释放所有拒绝遣返的朝鲜籍战俘，并把拒绝回家的中国战俘送到台湾去”。对于李承晚集团这样公开进行的企图破坏战俘遣返问题协议的预谋，美国军事当局并未加以任何制止，反而装聋作哑地予以纵容和默许。美军战俘营司令麦克加尔准将在十八日对记者发表的谈话中也已承认：“在越狱事件发生前几个星期，我们就预料到可能要发生事情”，但是，美国军事当局不但不采取任何措施，反而继续纵容李承晚集团任意胡作非为。美国合众社十八日东京电讯报道说：“克拉克将军的高级参谋人员过去就预料到李承晚的行动”，但“最后决定”是由李承晚集团的军队“继续担任战俘营的警卫工作”。这除了证明美国的军事当局对于李承晚集团企图破坏战俘遣返问题协议、实行强迫扣留战俘的行动，是完全有意地加以纵容和默许以外，还能够证明什么呢！
    显然的，任何企图掩饰美国对李承晚集团的纵容态度的言词都是无用的。东京美军总部在十八日发表的声明中说，战俘营的美国人员“曾尽力阻止今天战俘的大规模逃脱”，而“他们的努力大多是无济于事”。这完全是自欺欺人之谈。事实证明，负责管辖所有美方战俘营的克拉克将军的美军总部在十八日的事件发生之后，也还一味鼓励李承晚继续蛮干下去。美方战俘营司令美国准将麦克加尔在十八日还公开说过：“如果他们（指李承晚集团）今晚还想干一下的话，他们还可以干。”这就使事态更加恶化，以致在十九日和二十日又继续发生了强迫扣留战俘的事件。这更进一步证明美军总部声明中所说的“尽力阻止”乃是一句谎话；事实上他们不但不曾“阻止”，反而是“尽力”鼓励了李承晚集团的破坏协议的行动。这是再明显不过的了。
    无论如何，美军当局对于李承晚集团强迫扣留战俘的事件，必须担负完全的和绝对的责任。人们都知道，美国所指挥的所谓联合国军是包括南朝鲜的李承晚集团军队在内的。克拉克将军也承认，在一九五○年夏天李承晚集团已把在战争期间指挥南朝鲜军队的权限交给美军总部，因而美军当局完全有责任而且必须严格控制南朝鲜李承晚军队的一切行动。对于李承晚集团强迫扣留战俘的严重事件，美方更必须负责立即采取有效的处置，而绝对不容许用任何理由来推卸责任。美方首席谈判代表哈利逊在十八日致我方南日大将的信中，仅向我方空口表示要“尽力追回”被李承晚集团“释放”的战俘；美方战俘营司令麦克加尔竟又宣称不可能“捉回”那些被李承晚集团“释放”的战俘。美方的这种不负责任的态度是绝对不能容许的。
    根据双方代表团六月八日在板门店所签订的关于战俘遣返问题的协议，美方负有保证一切战俘不被强迫扣留的不可逃避的责任。关于战俘遣返问题的协议的基本精神，就是要保证全部战俘在停战之后有机会行使其被遣返的权利。关于中立国遣返委员会的职权范围的协议第一条第三款中规定，对于未直接行使其被遣返权利的战俘，“不得使用武力或以武力威胁以阻挠或强使其遣返”；第二条第四款又规定“一切于停战协定生效日后未行使其被遣返的权利之战俘，应尽速可行地，而在任何情况下应在停战协定生效日期后六十天内，从拘留一方的军事控制与收容下释放出来，在朝鲜境内由拘留一方指定之地点交给中立国遣返委员会。”现在，美方在全部停战协定眼看就要签字生效的时候，竟纵容和鼓励李承晚集团采取强迫扣留战俘的行动，剥夺了近二万六千不直接遣返的朝鲜籍战俘行使其遣返权利的机会，这显然严重地违背与破坏了双方在上述协议中第一条第三款的规定；如果美方又不能负责追回被强迫扣留的战俘，美方将更不能保证履行第二条第四款所规定的“在任何情况下”把一切未直接行使其遣返权利的战俘，交给中立国遣返委员会看管和处理。因此，摆在美方面前的责任，就是必须负责追回所有一切被李承晚集团从论山、马山、釜山、尚武台和永川等地战俘营强迫扣留的我方被俘人员。
    金日成元帅和彭德怀司令员六月十九日在答复克拉克将军的信中已明白指出：“鉴于这次事件所产生的异常严重的后果，我们不能不质问你方：究竟联合国军司令部能否控制南朝鲜的政府和军队？如果不能，那么，朝鲜停战究竟包括不包括李承晚集团在内？如果不包括在内，则停战协定在南朝鲜方面的实施有什么保障？如果包括在内，那么，你方就必须负责立即将此次所有‘在逃’的、亦即被‘释放’和胁迫扣留并准备编入南朝鲜军队中去的二万五千九百五十二名战俘，全部追回，并保证以后绝对不再发生同类事件。”很显然，改变这一局势的责任，现在是完全系于美方。
