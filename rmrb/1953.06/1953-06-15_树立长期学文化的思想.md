Since the launch of the cultural learning campaign in the army last year, the troops have taken on a new look. I have never seen such enthusiasm among our soldiers. Whether in the offices, in the companies, or even on the front lines and in the tunnels, everywhere is filled with phonetic symbols. Whatever tool can be used is labeled with them.

In less than a year, the achievements have been astonishing. It is very common to recognize two or three thousand characters, and some are already learning algebra. This makes me feel ashamed; although I also studied algebra, I am not as quick and fluent as the soldiers when solving problems today. They seem to solve problems correctly with such ease.

I often interact with two soldiers, one named Xiao Ruide and the other named Li Chenglan, both sons of farmers. Xiao Ruide was a volunteer soldier and has some basic education, and he is also younger, so he learns quickly. Now he has mastered arithmetic and algebra, can read "Days and Nights," and can write relatively coherent articles with few typos. Li Chenglan is older and suffered more in the old society, so he is slower to learn and cannot keep up with Xiao Ruide's progress in cultural learning. However, he can now write letters to his family.

It is worth mentioning that these two soldiers are not exclusively studying culture but also persist in their daily work. Sometimes they go out to work for two or three months. They rely on themselves to seize time and persevere, and also rely on the party and superiors in the army to arrange cultural tutors to give them supplementary lessons. I see these cultural tutors almost every day, and their work moves me. Regardless of day or night, rain or shine, they actively seek out their students, ask about their progress, and then tutor them until they catch up. Sometimes, when I see Li Chenglan's "dull" demeanor, I get anxious for the cultural tutor, but the tutor is still very patient in helping him.

I can hardly describe the joy of the soldiers when they read the books themselves or read them aloud to others. One day, when Li Chenglan brought me the newspaper, he said to me:

"Commander, in the past, the newspaper was always yours, but now, I have a share too."

That's how it is. Sometimes, the newspaper doesn't reach my house until the evening because they are reading it.

Culture has opened the door to political thought for the soldiers, and the newspapers have further "opened a window in their minds." The soldiers understand the world. When the soldiers first read Chairman Mao's works, their excitement could only be expressed in their own words:

"Chairman Mao! Today we truly meet you."

This situation has greatly improved the cultural level of our troops. Before the start of cultural learning in one unit, illiterates and semi-illiterates accounted for 83.2% of all cultural learners. By the end of April this year, among the cadres participating in the learning, 30% had reached the level of the first year of junior high school, 43.4% had reached the level of graduating from elementary school in two subjects (Chinese and arithmetic), and 24% had reached the level of graduating from elementary school in Chinese. Among the soldiers, 43.2% will have reached the level of graduating from elementary school in two subjects, and 49% will have reached the level of graduating from elementary school in Chinese. In one company, the original 89.6% were below the level of lower elementary school, but now 88.5% have reached the level of graduating from elementary school in Chinese and have reached the level of lower elementary school in arithmetic.

This achievement is indeed significant. It is not only reflected in the overall improvement of the cultural level of the entire army, but also in specific courses. Generally, troops can raise the literacy level to the level of graduating from elementary school in Chinese in just about 900 hours and achieve good results. From the Chinese assignments of cadres and soldiers, except for the slightly weaker foundation in characters, words, and sentences, other aspects are very good. A professor of Chinese language and students from the Chinese language department of Nanchang University visited the elementary school students in the army and believed that this was a historical miracle. A professor from Yunnan University visited a quick-study middle school in the army and wrote in the opinion book: "Witnessing the true colors of the soldiers, I am ashamed as a scholar."

This situation has brought about a series of changes in the appearance of the troops, presenting many new atmospheres, and has had a profound impact on the construction of the troops, creating favorable conditions for the theoretical learning and military technical learning of the vast number of commanders and fighters. In the past, they could not read books and could not take notes during lectures, so they easily forgot what they had learned, just as the quick clapper ballad composed by the soldiers themselves said: "Class is like shooting, opening your mouth bang, bang, bang, without cultural water, forgetting everything." Now it is completely different. After becoming literate, soldier Tan Wenhua said, "I feel like a different person. I can read newspapers myself. It's like wearing binoculars, and I can see things far away." A company commander said, "I have been memorizing the book 'On the Party' for several years. In the past, it was a burden, but now it is a treasure," because he can understand it now. The trend of commanders and fighters buying books is very strong. The Xinhua Bookstore sold 30,000 books in one month in a certain division, and some company libraries have expanded to more than 1,000 books, and some have even established unmanned libraries. Newspapers are also subscribed to individually. Literary works such as "An Ordinary Soldier," "A Real Man," "How the Steel Was Tempered," and "The Hurricane" have become the most beloved reading materials for the soldiers. "The People's Liberation Army Pictorial" is required by soldiers to add some text. "The People's Liberation Army Literature" has increased from one copy per company to two copies, and the soldiers are still not satisfied.

This situation has broadened the soldiers' horizons, expanded their minds, and improved their observation skills. When soldier Yang Zhirong went to the Niujie market, he saw the prosperity of the market, the construction of automobile factories, and the constant flow of cars on the road, which reminded him of the construction of the motherland. He wrote an article entitled "The Motherland is Advancing at a Rapid Pace." Soldier Zhang Qingfa wrote in his diary: "I love my motherland very much. I love her greatness, her vast land, her brave and hardworking people, and her great creations. I will hold my gun tightly and use my hands and life to defend her and build her." Such writing may be seen as conceptual, but if you think that this was written by the soldiers themselves after they learned culture, without a single mistake or typo, you will feel amazing.

Company commanders, battalion commanders, regimental commanders, and even higher-level cadres, after mastering culture, have also changed their outlook in learning modern military science and organizing modern warfare. I feel this even more significantly in the artillery I saw on the front lines. Calculating distances, calculating time, trigonometry, and geometry are much faster and more skilled in their minds than on the blackboard and in the notebook. Therefore, the hit rate against the enemy is also particularly high. This is the actual effect of cultural improvement in war.

The cultural life and creative activities that have been carried out due to the improvement of cultural level are also amazing. Gao YuBao, Cui BaWa, and others are already well-known people. Under their influence, soldiers not only know how to express general ideas in writing, but also can use writing to denounce the past and praise the present. Many troops can hold evening parties on Saturdays, and the programs of the evening parties include dance, singing, and recitation. And these programs are all the creations of the soldiers themselves. Some soldiers, like those who are engaged in creation in the performance team of soldiers in the Central and Southern Military Region, are also talking about what "summarization" and "concentration" are. As the soldiers themselves said in their assignments: "People from the club come and go in a continuous stream," "Wall newspaper drafts are as numerous as fish scales."

The soldiers are very happy, and their consciousness has been greatly improved. When one unit was on a train, whenever they stopped at a station for a major rest, the soldiers would play the accordion and sing and dance happily, forgetting the fatigue of the march, and the songs encouraged them to move forward. Company commanders and platoon leaders all reflected that "the soldiers are more progressive than before."

This is indeed a miracle in our army. The reason why it is a miracle is because the time is less than a year, "doing several years' worth of work in one year." This should be celebrated enthusiastically.

However, we cannot say that this is enough. If we consider the far-reaching goal of our army's cultural learning—to build a modernized national defense army so that we can confidently defeat the invasion of imperialist armies at any time—then our army's cultural level is far from sufficient. Moreover, the start of cultural education varies from earlier to later, the teaching methods vary from good to bad, and the teaching results are not balanced enough; especially the border and coastal defense troops and combat troops have insufficient learning time due to task relations, so the cultural level is also uneven. Therefore, we cannot be complacent and must realize that to obtain a higher cultural level that meets the needs of army construction is not a matter of overnight. All soldiers in the army must firmly establish the idea of learning culture for a long time, persistently, and unremittingly. Because our cultural learning is accelerated, the foundation is not solid enough, and cultural education itself has its own systematicness and regularity. We can only appropriately shorten the teaching process within the laws of cultural education, and we must never fantasize that we can reach a considerable high and solid cultural level from an illiterate in a short period of time. Concentrating time to intensively study culture is only to lay the foundation so that we have the possibility of continuing to improve, develop, and further our studies. However, the situation and tasks make it impossible for us to concentrate on studying culture for three or five years without carrying out the construction of a modernized and regularized national defense army. But we should not distort or misunderstand that carrying out the construction of a modernized and regularized national defense army is the end of cultural education, that we will no longer learn culture, or that we can not pay attention to the leadership of cultural learning; and those of us who have already learned a certain amount of culture should not feel that it is enough—in fact, the soldiers do not feel enough. Gao YuBao wrote such a famous article, but he still feels that it is not enough and continues to learn.

The central issue lies in the continued close attention of the leadership. We must change the past focus on leading cultural education to regular leadership; we must change the leadership of certain departments to participation in the leadership of future cultural education in various different work positions; and we must use the actual effect of cultural learning on the construction of a modernized and regularized national defense army to educate the vast number of soldiers and establish the idea of learning culture for a long time. Consolidate and improve the existing achievements in cultural learning!

    树立长期学文化的思想
    陈沂
    去年全军学习文化以来，部队改变了一个新的面貌。我从来没有看见过我们部队战士那种热情，无论在机关，在连队，甚至在战线上、坑道里，到处都写着注音符号，只要可以利用的工具，都注上了。
    还不到一年，其成绩是惊人的，认识两三千字，已经是很普遍的事了，有的已经在学代数，这使我自己都感到惭愧，我虽也学过代数，但今天演算起题目来，却还不如战士们敏捷、流利。他们都好像很随便的，一道道的题目就正确地演算出来。
    我经常接触有两个战士，一个叫萧瑞德，一个叫李成兰，两个都是农民的儿子。萧瑞德当过志愿军，有点文化基础，人也年轻一些，所以学起来快。现在算术学会了代数，能看“日日夜夜”，并能写较通顺和很少有别字的文章。李成兰岁数大一些，是一个在旧社会受磨折较多的人，所以表现较迟钝，学文化赶不上萧瑞德的成绩，但他现在也能给他家里的人写信了。
    值得提出的，这两个战士都不是专门学文化，还天天坚持工作，有时也外出工作，一出两三个月，一方面靠他们自己抓紧时间坚持，一方面也靠部队的党和上级为他们安排的文化教员补课。这些文化教员，我几乎天天见到他们，他们的工作使我感动，不论白天黑夜，不论刮风下雨，都是主动地找他的学生，问长问短，然后给他们补习，一直到赶上为止。有时我看到李成兰那股“呆”劲，我都替文化教员着急，但文化教员还是很耐心地帮助他。
    我真是难以形容战士们拿着书自己念或念给别人听的那种高兴。有一天李成兰把报纸送给我的时候，就向我说过：
    “首长，往年报纸都是你的，现在，我也有份了。”
    就是这样，有时报纸在我家里要到晚上才能看见，原因是他们在看。
    文化为战士们打开了政治思想的大门，而报纸更为他们“在脑子里开了窗户”，战士们懂得世界了。当战士们最初读毛主席的著作时，战士们兴奋之情，只有他们自己的话可以说明：
    “毛主席呀！我们今天是真正同你见面了。”
    这情况，使得我们部队的文化水平大大提高。某部在开始文化学习前，文盲、半文盲占全部文化学习人员的百分之八十三点二，到今年四月底，参加学习的干部中，有百分之三十达到初中一年级的程度，百分之四十三点四达到语文、算术两门以上的高小毕业程度，百分之二十四达到语文高小程度以上。战士中将有百分之四十三点二达到高小两门以上，百分之四十九达到语文高小程度以上。某连全连原有百分之八十九点六为初小以下程度，现在已有百分之八十八点五达到语文高小毕业，算术初小以上的程度。
    这个成绩确是很大的。不仅表现在全军普遍提高了文化水平，在具体课程上，也是如此。一般的部队，仅仅以九百小时左右，就将文盲提到语文高小毕业的水平，并获得良好的效果。从干部、战士的语文作业来看，除字、词、句的基础稍差外，其他各方面都是很好的。南昌某大学语文教授和语文系的学生参观了部队高小学员的作业之后，认为这是历史上的奇迹。云南某大学教授参观了部队某速成中学之后，在意见本上写道：“亲观战士真颜色，羞得书生满面红”。
    这情况，使部队的面貌引起了一系列的变化，呈现了许多新的气象，对部队的建设起了深刻的影响，为部队广大指战员的理论学习和军事技术学习创设了有利的条件。过去看不了书，听课时不能作笔记，因而学了也很容易忘掉，正如战士自己所编的快板一样：“上课像打枪，开口嘡嘡嘡，没有文化水，忘的一溜光。”现在完全变了，战士谭文华由文盲变成能看书后，说：“我像变了一个人，自己能看书报了，就像戴了一副望远镜，能看到远处的东西了。”一个连长说：“我背‘论党’这本书，背了好几年了。过去是包袱，现在是宝贝”，就是因为他能看懂了。指战员买书的风气很盛，新华书店在某师一个月推销了三万册书，有的连队图书馆已经扩充到一千册书以上，有的并建立了无人管理的图书馆。报纸还有个人订阅的。文艺作品如“普通一兵”、“真正的人”、“钢铁是怎样炼成的”、
    “暴风骤雨”……，已成为战士最喜爱的读物；
    “解放军画报”，战士都要求增加一些文字；“解放军文艺”由一个连一册增加到两册，战士还不满足。
    这情况，使战士们的眼界扩大了，胸襟开阔了，观察能力提高了。战士杨志荣去牛街赶集，见到市面繁荣，修起汽车厂，公路上的汽车不断，即联想到祖国的建设，写了一篇“祖国在飞速前进”的文章。战士张庆发在自己的日记上写道：“我很爱我的祖国，我爱她伟大，有广阔的土地，勇敢勤劳的人民和伟大的创造，我要紧握着枪，用自己的双手和生命来保卫她，建设她。”这样的文字，可能会被人看为概念化，但是如果想想这是战士在学得文化之后，亲笔写的，没有一个错字和别字，你就会感到了不得了。
    连长、营长、团长，甚至更高级的干部，在掌握了文化之后，在学习现代化的军事科学和组织现代化的战争上，也改变了面貌，而这方面我在阵地上看到的炮兵，就更感觉显著。算距离、算时间、三角、几何在他们的脑子里比在黑板和本子上快得多，熟练得多，因而对敌人的命中率也特别大。这是文化提高在战争中的实际效果。
    因文化水平提高而开展的文化生活，创作活动，也是很惊人的，高玉宝、崔八娃等已经是众所周知的人了，在他们的影响下，战士不仅懂得用文字表达一般思想，而且能够用文字控诉过去，歌颂现在。许多部队能在星期六开晚会，而晚会的节目是包括着舞蹈、歌唱、朗诵的。而这些节目，又都是战士自己的创作。有的战士，像中南军区战士演出队搞创作的人，也在谈什么“概括”、“集中”这些问题了。正如战士们自己在作业中所说的：“俱乐部的人，川流不息地往来”，“墙报稿子像鱼鳞一样多。”
    战士们十分愉快了，自觉性大大提高了，某部在乘坐火车中，一到车站大休息时，战士们手风琴一拉，就欢乐地唱起来、舞起来，忘记了行军的疲劳，歌声鼓舞着他们前进。连长、排长都反映“战士比以前更进步了。”
    这的确是我们部队的奇迹，其所以成为奇迹，就是因为时间才不到一年，“一年干了好几年的事”。这是应该热烈庆幸的。
    但是我们不能说这就够了。如果从我们部队学文化的远大目的——建设现代化的国防军，以便随时有把握地战胜帝国主义军队的侵略，那我们部队的文化水平还远远不足，加以文化教育的开始有先有后，教学方法有好有差，教学收效也不够平衡；特别是边防海防部队、作战部队因任务关系，学习时间不足，所以文化水平也高低不一。因而我们还不能自满，必须认识，要想得到一个较高的文化水平，适合部队建设需要，就不是一朝一夕之功，全军战士必须牢固地树立起长期地坚持不懈地学习文化的思想。正因为我们的学文化是速成的，所以基础不够牢固，而且文化教育的本身有它的系统性和规律性，我们只能在文化教育的规律中，把教学过程适当的缩短，绝不能幻想短时间内就能从一个文盲达到相当高的、巩固的文化水平。集中时间突击学文化，只是为了奠定基础，使我们有继续提高、发展、深造的可能，但形势和任务又使我们不可能集中三年五年时间专门学习文化，而不进行现代化正规化国防军的建设。但我们也不应曲解、误解以为进行现代化正规化国防军的建设，就是文化教育的结束，就是不再学文化，就可以不重视文化学习的领导；而我们已经学得了一定文化的人，也不要觉得够了——实际上战士都没有感到够的，高玉宝写了那样有名的文章，他还感到不够，还在继续学习。
    中心问题是在于领导继续抓紧，要把过去那种重点领导文化教育变成经常领导；要把一定部门的领导变为各种不同的工作岗位上参与今后文化教育的领导；用学文化对现代化正规化国防军建设的实际效果，来教育广大战士，树立长期学文化的思想。把已有的文化学习的成绩巩固起来，提高起来！
