Xinhua News Agency, Prague, June 20th: The London "Daily Worker" published an editorial on the 19th, commenting on the action of the U.S. puppet Syngman Rhee in forcibly "releasing" prisoners of war at a time when the world was anticipating the final conclusion of the armistice agreement. The editorial considered this action to be "one of the most outrageous acts in history."

The editorial continued, it is impossible for this event to have occurred without the prior planning of high-ranking U.S. authorities. Indeed, Syngman Rhee's statement has already made it clear that he consulted with important American figures when planning this action. Last Sunday, "The Observer" published a dispatch from its correspondent in Korea stating that Syngman Rhee "would even release those non-communist prisoners of war guarded by Korean guards." However, until now, no action has been taken to restrain him from this action, which clearly shows that he is being instigated by American elements.

The "Daily Worker" pointed out that this action seriously threatens the armistice negotiations and called on the British government and all those who advocate peace in Korea to prevent "this sinister adventurer" from undermining world peace.

The editorial reminded everyone not to be complacent in the face of these events and called on everyone to support the proposal of the National Women's Conference in the broadest and most forceful way by petitioning British Labour Party members of Parliament on June 25, the third anniversary of the Korean War. The editorial concluded that on this day, "everyone should take action and hold rallies to demand an end to the undermining of negotiations and to demand consultations between the major powers following the settlement of the Korean issue."

    伦敦“工人日报”斥责李承晚强迫扣留战俘
    【新华社布拉格二十日电】伦敦“工人日报”十九日发表社论，评述美国傀儡李承晚在举世期待停战协定最后缔结之时强制“释放”战俘的行为。社论认为，这种行动是“历史上最横暴的行动之一”。
    社论继续说，这件事情假如不是事前得到美国高级当局的预谋，那是不可能发生的。的确，李承晚的声明已经明白表示，他计划这步行动的时候，曾经和重要的美国人物商量过。上星期日，“观察家”发表了它驻朝鲜记者的消息说，李承晚“甚至会释放那些由朝鲜警卫看管的非共产党战俘”。然而，直到现在，对他这种行动还没有采取任何行动加以约束，这里显然可见他是得到美国分子的怂恿的。
       “工人日报”指出这种行动严重地威胁了停战谈判，并要求英国政府和一切主张朝鲜和平的人防止“这个罪恶的冒险家”破坏世界和平。
    社论提醒大家不要在这些事件之前麻痹，并号召大家最广泛和最有力地支持全国妇女会议的提议，在六月二十五日朝鲜战争三周年的时候向英国工党议员请愿。社论最后说，在这一天，“大家应该行动起来并举行集会，要求终止破坏谈判的行为，并要求在朝鲜问题获得解决之后跟着举行大国间的协商。”
