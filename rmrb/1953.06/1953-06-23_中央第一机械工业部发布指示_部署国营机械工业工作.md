The Central First Ministry of Machine Building issued instructions on the current situation of the state-owned machine industry and the main points of future work deployment. The full text is as follows:

The machine manufacturing industry is the main department and leading enterprise for realizing national industrialization and transforming the national economy, and it should serve all sectors of the national economy. Its development and growth play a decisive role in promoting the development of other industrial sectors. Therefore, on the basis of existing factories, making adjustments and carrying out possible technical improvements or renovations, coordinating with Soviet technical assistance, providing the necessary industrial equipment for the country to achieve the Five-Year Plan, and combining the renovation and production activities of the original enterprises well with the construction of new enterprises, so that the machine industry gradually becomes an independent and complete machine manufacturing industry, this is the extremely arduous task of the machine manufacturing industry in the future.

The Basic Situation of the Machine Industry at Present

For more than three years, under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government, thanks to the efforts of all employees, the machine industry has made great gains in restoring production and management. However, due to the weak foundation of China's machine industry, the chaotic equipment, the backward technology, and some shortcomings and errors in our work, China's machine industry is currently in such a contradictory state: on the one hand, it cannot meet the needs of national construction, and on the other hand, the potential strength is still great and cannot be fully utilized. In order to gradually change this situation, we must overcome the shortcomings and errors in our work.

According to preliminary inspection and analysis, the main problems in the management of the machine industry are as follows:

First, the most prominent problem in the machine industry is that existing factories have not been well organized according to needs and possibilities, and the distribution of equipment is very unreasonable. The production tasks and division of labor in some factories are not clear and appropriate. Factories doing rough work are using precision machines, while factories doing fine work are using ordinary machines; using large machines to do small work, and requiring small machines to do large work; in the assignment of production tasks, sometimes several factories produce the same variety (model) and the same type of product, while some needed products are not undertaken by any factory, resulting in a surplus of certain products and a shortage of certain products; some factories excessively emphasize "unification" and are unwilling to try out new products, while the products of some factories are too complex and the tasks are constantly changing.

Due to the existence of the above phenomena, serious phenomena such as uneven utilization of equipment and low utilization efficiency have been caused. According to the results of the production capacity survey of the various factories under the ministry last year, the equipment utilization capacity is less than one-half, which shows the seriousness of the situation.

The main reason for the above-mentioned phenomena is that in our work, we lack systematic understanding and research on objective needs and the basic conditions and development conditions of existing factories, and there is subjectivism and blindness. Because we do not understand the needs and have not figured out the basic situation of the factories, it is impossible to combine the needs and possibilities well. In this way, not only can we not determine the production plan of each factory well, but it also affects the inability to correctly formulate the product plan and construction scale of some renovation and new construction factories, so it is impossible to reasonably adjust the existing equipment.

Second, the most prominent problem in the production of machine enterprises is the extremely uneven production activities. The production process of manufacturing a machine is extremely complicated, with hundreds or even thousands of processes, so the requirements for balanced production are even more strict and urgent. However, in the ninety-one state-owned factories under the ministry, there are no exceptions to the phenomenon of being loose in the beginning and tight at the end, and loose here and tight there, such as the common phenomenon of being loose at the beginning of the month, quarter, and year, and tight at the end of the month, quarter, and year. In many factories, there is also a phenomenon of being loose in this workshop and tight in that workshop, or loose in the previous process and tight in the next process, and it is impossible to organize rhythmic production.

There are many reasons for the imbalance of production activities, but the most important is the lack of planned management. In particular, many factories do not have specific work plans, so there are chaotic phenomena in the allocation of production tasks, the arrangement of production procedures, the organization and deployment of labor, the repair and maintenance of equipment, and the supply of materials and tools.

Third, another serious problem in the production of machine enterprises is the poor quality of products. The products of the machine industry are mostly equipment for basic construction, which directly affects the quality of construction. If this situation cannot be improved, it will cause serious consequences for the country's construction work. The poor quality of products is not only directly related to the imbalance of production activities and the chaos of production management, but also has the following two aspects of reasons: on the one hand, it is due to the lack of attention to product design work, the failure to establish a product design organization, or the low quality of the design, or even the complete use of outdated drawings, so that the quality of the product cannot reach the due level; on the other hand, it is due to the laxity of technical management, and many products do not have strict technical standards, operating procedures and inspection systems, resulting in a serious phenomenon of many defective products and substandard products.

Fourth, in terms of basic construction, some units have a tendency to be "rather big than small," eager for quick success, acting beyond their capabilities, and neglecting the use of existing equipment when formulating plans. Some comrades complained that the old equipment was broken and rotten, and they were all eager for the latest equipment and the largest scale, so they relaxed the full utilization and adjustment of existing equipment. Obviously, this idea is wrong.

The weakest link in basic construction is currently the design work. Not enough attention is paid to cultivating factory design forces, there is a lack of proper arrangements and organization for the entire design progress, and there is a lack of strong criticism and education for the wrong ideas and wrong designs of some designers. Many units also lack due attention to the collection of design data. The above-mentioned phenomena have resulted in low design efficiency, frequent design rework, and design errors, making the design work unable to keep up with the requirements of construction, causing serious phenomena such as work stoppages waiting for drawings or rework in construction, and wasting national funds.

As for the chaotic phenomena and waste phenomena caused by no one being responsible in the basic construction construction, it is even more serious in the state-owned machine industry system.

The emergence of these shortcomings and errors is mainly due to the insufficient understanding of the importance and complexity of basic construction by some leading cadres, resulting in many blind phenomena in the work.

The Main Tasks at Present

In 1953, China began its first great Five-Year Construction Plan. The basic task of China's first Five-Year Plan is to lay the foundation for national industrialization and ensure the continuous growth of socialist economic components. As the "heart" of industry, the machine industry will shoulder extremely important tasks. The total output value of the state-owned machine industry will increase by 64 percent compared to 1952, labor productivity will increase by 24 percent compared to 1952, costs will be reduced by 11 percent, and the amount of basic construction work in 1953 will increase by about 180 percent compared to 1952, and more than ten large projects will begin construction.

In order to complete and strive to exceed the national plan, the following main tasks must be carefully carried out from now on:

First, organize the existing machine factories, further clarify the division of labor, give full play to potential capabilities, and strive to better meet the needs of national construction. To this end, we should: First, investigate and study the needs of various aspects for electromechanical equipment in the Five-Year Plan and in the longer term, analyze them specifically, and actively and proactively solicit the opinions of major users, modify them, and then calculate the ratio and quota of various equipment needs, and understand the specifications of major products. Second, comprehensively understand the existing state-owned factories (including local state-owned factories), analyze their site, production, technology, and renovation conditions, and consider the existing factories together with the future newly built factories in accordance with national needs, so that each enterprise can gradually implement relatively specialized production, the production of each enterprise can cooperate with each other, and then consider the good cooperation between centralized large-scale production and small and medium-sized production using local raw materials, in order to carry out the division of labor, determine the renovation direction of existing factories, and formulate its annual and five-year renovation plan and production plan. This is the most basic work to combine production with needs. Third, the equipment of existing factories should be gradually adjusted in a planned manner. After the division of labor direction of the factory is determined, it is possible to allocate equipment in a planned manner according to its production tasks, and overcome the unreasonable distribution of equipment. In the work of allocating equipment, oppose departmentalism and local viewpoints. Fourth, strengthen production cooperation between factories, especially the production cooperation of large castings, large forgings, and large machined parts. Departmentalism that only cares about working alone and not cooperating or is afraid of trouble should be criticized.

While adjusting the existing state-owned machine industry, the important role of the private machine industry at present should also be taken into account. Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen the leadership of the private machine industry through processing and ordering methods, in order to use and organize the production capacity of the existing equipment of the private machine industry, and serve the country's construction cause under the principle of giving consideration to both public and private interests.

Second, strengthen production management. Due to the variety of machines, the large number of parts, the long production process, and the strict quality requirements, the production management of the machine industry is an extremely complex organizational work. Precisely because of this, strengthening planning management, strengthening the organization of production and the responsibility system through it, thereby ensuring quality, organizing balanced production, and putting production management on the right track, has special and important significance in the machine manufacturing industry.

In order to establish and strengthen planning management, first of all, it is necessary to establish in all employees the concept that the national plan is the law and the concept of comprehensively completing the national plan in a balanced manner. After the enterprise plan is approved by the state, employees should be mobilized to discuss it, and revise various backward production quotas in the discussion, and overcome conservative ideas and other wrong ideas. On this basis, establish an original record and statistical system, formulate specific work plans for workshops, sections, and groups, and systematically promote the organization of rhythmic production according to the instruction chart, and gradually achieve balanced completion of the plan every ten days, every month, and every quarter, and ensure that not only the quantity is completed, but also the variety, quality, cost, and financial plans are completed. The second is to establish and improve the responsibility system, so that each job and each position has a person in charge; at the same time, establish and improve the contact system for various aspects of work, and eliminate the phenomenon of no one being responsible and being disjointed in the work. At present, special attention should be paid to establishing and strengthening the equipment maintenance and repair responsibility system, quality (technical) responsibility system, material tool supply responsibility system, production system responsibility system, technical security responsibility system, drawing management responsibility system and other systems.

Third, strengthen technical management to ensure and improve product quality. This work must be carried out in two aspects: on the one hand, stipulating technical standards and technical operating procedures, and on the other hand, strengthening the inspection system and stipulating practical inspection methods. The process of formulating technical operating procedures should also be a process of constantly absorbing advanced experience from the masses, from rough to fine, from low to high, and constantly summarizing, educating, and improving the masses. Therefore, any product must have technical standards and operating procedures. Even individual production, rather than batch or mass production, must formulate operating procedures for the main components, which is the fundamental way to ensure quality. At the same time, strengthen the inspection system, and discover problems in product quality at any time, so as to improve them in time. In addition, in order to ensure quality, it is also necessary to frequently and proactively solicit users' opinions, and from time to time launch quality inspection campaigns among the masses, to educate the broad masses of employees with concrete examples and vivid methods.

Because the development process of each factory is different, the work foundation is different, and the various specific conditions are different, the above-mentioned tasks must be carried out step by step and with emphasis in combination with the specific situation of each enterprise. All factories with a better work foundation (these factories currently account for a small number) should consolidate and improve the degree of production balance on the existing foundation, further strengthen technical management, and gradually implement a comprehensive economic accounting system; all factories that have initially adjusted equipment and established a production responsibility system (these factories account for the majority) should focus on consolidating the responsibility system, further improving the planning management, organizing rhythmic balanced production, and gradually strengthening technical management; all factories with a weak work foundation and that have just started or have not yet started production reform (these factories account for a relatively small number) should establish a planning management system, improve labor organization, and establish and improve the responsibility system. As for further formulating technical and economic quotas, strengthening cost and financial management, etc., it should be gradually resolved in the process of carrying out the above-mentioned tasks.

In addition to the above, the production management of the machine industry must also vigorously strengthen the trial production of new products and increase the variety of products. Through the trial production of new products, gradually eliminate outdated and backward products, and uniformly adopt advanced Soviet specifications and drawings. Only in this way can the technical level of China's machine industry be rapidly improved. In order to enable new products to quickly enter regular production, the trial production of new products must be carried out in accordance with certain procedures. In the past, some factories lacked due attention in this regard, and the trial production of new products was not done well. For example, some factories did not conduct trial production before formal production, or only conducted trial production for the sake of trial production, which not only did not prepare for formal production, but also caused confusion in the entire production process. In order to overcome the above-mentioned shortcomings, the procedure for the trial production of new products must be correctly stipulated, mainly: (1) Product selection and product design. This work should be considered in combination with the long-term construction needs of the country, economic value, the development direction of the machine industry, and the professional direction of the enterprise. (2) Sample trial production. The purpose of this work is to check the correctness of design technology, identify quality and performance, accumulate technical experience, and summarize technical preparation work. (3) Gradual batch production. The purpose of this work is to assess the economic rationality of the manufacturing process in order to enter formal production. In order to do these tasks well, it is necessary to establish and improve the organization of new product design and management, pay great attention to strengthening the tool workshop and technical preparation work before production, stipulate strict progress plans, check on schedule, and fully rely on the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses.

Third, strengthen the leadership of basic construction. In the basic construction work, first of all, we must firmly grasp the policies of the Party and the government, formulate basic construction plans according to the current and long-term needs of the country and the existing possible conditions, and determine the specific product plans and scales of newly built and expanded enterprises. We should use concrete examples to criticize the idea of greed for more and rash advance and the idea of reliance and waiting for lack of active preparation in the relevant cadres, as well as the crude and careless style of not conducting investigations and studies and not considering the needs of the country, but blindly determining factory construction plans and product plans.

Secondly, continue to expand and improve the design force, and strengthen design planning and organizational leadership to ensure the timely completion of this year's design tasks and the smooth progress of next year's construction work. In particular, the collection of information required for the Soviet Union to design must be prepared properly on time. To this end, we must continue to concentrate design forces, and train professional designers and professional technical cadres such as engineering geology, surveying, and soil analysis, and at the same time, quickly compile design work progress schedules according to the size of the project, the main and secondary, and conduct ideological education for design personnel through concrete examples of good and bad design work, on the one hand, encouraging progress, and on the other hand, we must criticize and overcome the bourgeois viewpoints and irresponsible erroneous designs of some designers, and call on and organize everyone to seriously learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union.

Thirdly, in the construction work, we should focus on: carefully reviewing the quality of the design and construction drawings before construction to prevent rework and waste due to design errors; leading the exposure of construction without planning, chaotic management and no one being responsible, and establishing a planning management and responsibility system in construction work; timely conducting engineering quality inspections, and establishing and improving the technical management system through mass inspections to ensure engineering quality; establishing a financial management system and striving to make budget final accounts on schedule. The above-mentioned work should be carried out in stages according to the different start-up times of projects in various places. In the process of carrying out, attention should be paid to adopting the working method of combining advanced driving backward and reward with criticism.

Finally, in order to enable the growth of basic construction forces to adapt to the needs of the ever-increasing basic construction tasks in the future, we must systematically improve the technical level of existing technical personnel and skilled workers, improve the work of secondary technical schools, technical schools, and technical training classes, and vigorously cultivate the reserve force for construction. Strengthen ideological and political work in enterprises

In order to ensure the completion of the above-mentioned tasks, it is necessary to strengthen ideological and political work in enterprises, so that all employees understand the significance of the work, the guiding principles of the work, and the methods of completing the work tasks, so that it is possible to enable the broad masses to give full play to their high enthusiasm and creativity and strive to complete and overfulfill the national tasks. Therefore, any practice of neglecting and abandoning ideological and political work is completely wrong, and it will only cause our work to suffer failure. The ideological and political work in enterprises should be carried out closely around the central tasks of production and basic construction of the enterprise, and by specifically and deeply examining the work, exposing and overcoming the problems and errors in our work, thereby educating and improving the awareness of all employees, and combining political work with economic work. In this regard, many advanced enterprises in China have created good experience, and leading cadres of all state-owned machine enterprises should learn this working method. Only in this way can we become economic workers with political minds, not narrow pragmatists and shortsighted economic workers; only in this way can we gradually understand the business, become experts, and lead enterprises concretely and practically, rather than "generally" and "from the air" leading enterprises; and only in this way can we overcome bureaucracy in enterprise leadership and improve the leadership level of enterprise management.

    中央第一机械工业部发布指示
    部署国营机械工业工作
    【本报讯】中央人民政府第一机械工业部发布关于目前国营机械工业的情况及今后工作部署要点的指示。全文如下：
    机械制造工业是实现国家工业化和改造国民经济的主要部门和主导企业，要为国民经济一切部门服务。它的发展和壮大，对促进其他工业部门的发展具有决定性的作用。因此，就现有工厂的基础，加以调整和进行可能的技术改进或改造，配合苏联的技术援助，为国家实现五年计划提供必要的工业设备，并把原有企业的改造和生产活动与新企业的建设很好地结合起来，使机械工业逐渐成为独立而完整的机械制造业，这就是机械制造工业今后极艰巨的任务。
    机械工业目前的基本情况
    三年多来，在毛主席和中央人民政府的领导下，由于全体职工的努力，机械工业在恢复生产和管理工作方面，有了很大的收获。但由于我国机械工业原来的基础薄弱，设备杂乱，技术落后以及我们在工作当中还存在着一些缺点和错误，就使得我国机械工业在目前处在这样的矛盾状态中：一方面是不能满足国家建设的需要，另方面则是潜在力量还很大，不能充分发挥。为了逐步地改变这种情况，必须克服我们工作中的缺点和错误。
    根据初步的检查和分析，当前机械工业管理工作中主要存在着以下几方面的问题：
    第一、目前机械工业中最突出的问题是现有工厂未能根据需要与可能很好地组织起来，设备的分布很不合理，有些工厂的生产任务和分工不够明确和恰当。做粗活的工厂使用着精密的机器，做细活的工厂则使用着普通的机器；使用大型机器做小活，要求小型机器做大活；在生产任务的分配上，有时几个工厂生产同一品种（型号）、同一种类的产品，而有些需要的产品则没有工厂承造，致使某些产品过剩，某些产品缺乏；有些工厂过分强调“单一化”，不愿试制新产品，有些工厂的产品又过分复杂，任务经常变化。
    由于上述现象的存在，就造成了设备的忙闲不均，利用效率很低等严重现象。根据去年我部所属各厂生产能力查定的结果来看，设备利用能力尚不足二分之一，足见情况之严重。
    产生上述现象的主要原因，就是由于在我们的工作中，对客观需要和现有工厂的基本情况及其发展条件缺乏系统的了解与研究，存在着主观主义和盲目性。因为不了解需要，和没有摸清工厂的基本情况，就不可能很好地把需要和可能结合起来。这样，不仅不能很好地确定每个工厂的生产计划，而且还影响到不能正确地制定有些改建、新建工厂的产品方案和建设规模，因此也就无法合理地调整现有设备。
    第二、在机械企业的生产方面，最突出的问题是生产活动的极不均衡。制造一架机器的生产过程是极其繁杂的，有数百道乃至数千道工序，因此它对均衡生产的要求就更加严格和迫切。但在本部所属九十一个国营工厂中，在生产上都毫无例外地存在着前松后紧，此松彼紧等不均衡现象，除了习见的月初、季初、年初松，月末、季末、年末紧的现象外，许多工厂在这个车间与那个车间之间或前道工序与下道工序之间，也是此松彼紧，不能组织有节奏的生产。
    造成生产活动不均衡的原因固然很多，但最主要的是由于缺乏计划管理，特别是许多工厂没有具体的作业计划，因此在生产任务的分配、生产程序的安排、劳动力的组织和调配、设备的检修和保养以及材料和工具的供应等方面，都存在着紊乱现象。
    第三、在机械企业的生产方面，另一严重问题是产品质量不好。机械工业的产品，绝大部分都是基本建设的设备，它直接影响建设的质量。如果这种情况不能加以改善，将会给国家的建设工作造成严重的后果。产品质量不好，除了直接和生产活动不均衡与生产管理混乱分不开以外，还有以下两方面的原因：一方面是由于不重视产品设计工作，没有建立产品设计的机构，或设计的质量低劣，甚至完全使用陈旧的图纸，使产品的质量不能达到应有的水平；另一方面则是由于技术管理的松弛，许多产品没有严格的技术标准，操作规程和检验制度，以致造成废品和次品很多的严重现象。
    第四、在基本建设方面，在编制计划时有些单位存在着“宁大勿小”、急于求成，不量力而行和忽视利用现有设备等偏向。有些同志埋怨旧的设备破破烂烂，一心向往于最新的设备和最大的规模，因而放松了对现有设备的充分利用和调整工作。显然，这种思想是错误的。
    在基本建设中当前最薄弱的环节是设计工作。对培养工厂设计力量重视不够，对整个设计进度缺乏妥善的安排和组织，对某些设计人员的错误思想和错误的设计，也缺乏有力的批判和教育，许多单位对设计资料的搜集工作也缺乏应有的注意。上述现象，造成了设计效率不高，设计经常返工及设计错误等不良结果，使设计工作赶不上施工的要求，造成施工中的停工待图或返工等严重现象，浪费了国家资金。
    至于基本建设施工中由于无人负责而造成的混乱现象和浪费现象，在国营机械工业系统中更是十分严重的。
    这些缺点和错误的产生，主要是由于某些领导干部对基本建设的重要性和复杂性认识不足，在工作中产生了许多盲目现象。
    当前的主要任务
    一九五三年我国开始了第一个伟大的五年建设计划。我国第一个五年建设的基本任务，是为国家工业化建立基础并保证社会主义经济成份不断地增长。作为工业“心脏”的机械工业，将担负着极为重要的任务。国营机械工业的生产总值将较一九五二年增加百分之六十四，劳动生产率将比一九五二年提高百分之二十四，成本将降低百分之十一，一九五三年基本建设工作量，将比一九五二年增加百分之一百八十左右，有十个以上的较大工程开始进行建设。
    为了完成并争取超过国家计划，必须从现在开始，认真做好下列几项主要工作：
    第一、把现有的机械工厂组织起来，进一步明确分工，发挥潜在能力，争取更多更好地满足国家建设的需要。为此应该：首先，调查研究五年计划中和今后较长时期内各方面对机电设备的需要，加以具体分析，并主动地积极地征求主要用户的意见，加以修正，从而计算出各种设备需要的比例和定额，并了解主要产品的规范。其次，将现有国营工厂（连同地方国营工厂在内）通盘加以了解，分析它的厂址、生产、技术和改造的条件，根据国家需要，将现有的工厂连同将来新建的工厂全面加以考虑，使每个企业能够逐步地相对地实行专业生产，各个企业的生产能够互相配合，并进而考虑使集中的大生产和利用当地原料的中小生产之间也能很好配合起来，以便进行分工，确定现有工厂的改建方向，并制定其年度的，五年的改建计划和生产计划。这是使生产与需要相结合的最基本的工作。再次，应有计划地将现有工厂的设备逐步加以调整。工厂分工方向确定之后，就有可能根据其生产任务有计划地将设备加以调配，克服设备分布的不合理状态。在调配设备工作中，反对本位主义和局部观点。再次，加强各厂间的生产合作，特别是大铸件、大锻件、大加工件的生产合作，对那些只顾单干不顾合作或怕麻烦的本位主义思想，应当进行批判。
    在调整现有国营机械工业的同时，还应考虑到私营机械工业在目前的重要作用，因此，必须通过加工订货方式，加强对私营机械工业的领导，以利用和组织私营机械工业现有设备的生产能力，在公私兼顾下为国家的建设事业服务。
    第二、加强生产管理工作。由于机器的品种多、部件多、生产过程长、质量要求严格，机械工业的生产管理是一件极其复杂的组织工作。正因为如此，加强计划管理工作，通过它加强生产的组织工作和责任制，从而保证质量，组织均衡生产，使生产管理走上正常轨道，在机器制造工业中就有着特殊重要的意义。
    为了要建立与加强计划管理，首先就必须在全体职工中，树立国家计划即是法律的观念和均衡地全面地完成国家计划的观念。企业计划经过国家批准后，应发动职工进行讨论，并在讨论中修订各种落后的生产定额，克服保守思想和其他错误思想。在此基础上，建立原始记录和统计制度，制定车间、工段和小组具体的作业计划，有步骤地推行按指示图表组织有节奏的生产，逐步做到均衡地每旬、每月、每季完成计划，并保证不仅要完成数量，而且要完成品种、质量和成本、财务的计划。其次是建立与健全责任制，使每一工作，每一岗位都有专人负责；同时建立与健全各方面工作的联系制度，消灭工作中无人负责现象和互相脱节现象。目前要特别注意建立与加强设备保养和检修责任制，质量（技术）责任制，材料工具供应责任制，生产制度责任制，技术保安责任制，图纸管理责任制等制度。
    再次是加强技术管理，保证和提高产品质量。这一工作必须从两方面去进行，一方面是规定技术标准和技术操作规程，另一方面则是加强检验制度和规定切实可行的检验办法。技术操作规程的制定过程，应当同时也是不断地吸收群众中的先进经验，从粗到精，从低级到高级，不断的总结教育和提高群众的过程。因此任何产品都必须有技术标准和操作规程。即便是个别生产而非成批或大量生产的产品，也必须制定主要部件的操作规程，这是保证质量的根本办法。同时，加强检验制度，随时发现产品质量方面发生的问题，以便及时加以改进。此外，为了保证质量，还必须经常地和主动地征求用户意见，适时地在群众中展开质量检查运动，以具体的事例和生动的方式教育广大职工群众。
    由于各个工厂发展的过程不同，工作基础不同，各种具体条件不同，因此在进行上述各项工作时，必须结合各该企业的具体情况，有步骤地和有重点地进行。凡工作基础较好的工厂（这类工厂目前还占少数），应在现有的基础上面，巩固与提高生产的均衡程度，进一步加强技术管理，逐步实行全面的经济核算制度；凡是初步调整了设备，建立了生产责任制的工厂（这类工厂占多数），应着重巩固责任制度，进一步健全计划管理，组织有节奏的均衡生产并逐步加强技术管理；凡是工作基础薄弱，刚进行或尚未开始生产改革的工厂（这类工厂占较少数），则应建立计划管理制度，改善劳动组织，建立与健全责任制。至于进一步制定技术经济定额，加强成本和财务管理等工作，则应在进行上述各项工作中逐步解决。
    机械工业的生产管理工作，除上述之外，还必须大力加强新产品试制工作，增加产品品种。通过新产品的试制逐步地淘汰型式陈旧与落后的产品，统一采用先进的苏联规格和图纸。只有如此才能迅速地提高我国机械工业的技术水平。为使新产品能迅速转入正规生产，必须按照一定的程序进行新产品的试制工作。过去有一些工厂，在这一方面缺乏应有的注意，新产品试制工作做得不好，如有的工厂，在正式生产前不进行试制，或是仅仅为试制而试制，不但没有为正式生产作好准备，反而使整个生产程序发生混乱。为了克服上述缺点，必须正确规定新产品试制的程序，主要的是：（1）产品选定与产品设计。这一工作，应从国家长远建设需要，经济价值，机械工业的发展方针及企业的专业方向相结合考虑。（2）样品试制。这一工作的目的在于核对设计技术上的正确性，鉴定质量和性能，积累技术经验，总结技术准备工作。（3）逐渐成批生产。这一工作的目的在于考核制造过程的经济合理性，以便进入正式生产。为了做好这些工作，必须建立与健全新产品设计和管理的组织，十分注意加强工具车间和生产前的技术准备工作，规定严格的进度计划，按期检查，并充分依靠群众的积极性和创造性。
    第三、加强对基本建设的领导。在基本建设工作中，首先必须紧紧地掌握党和政府的政策，根据国家目前和长远的需要以及现有的可能条件，制定基本建设计划，确定新建和扩建企业的具体产品方案与规模。应该用具体的实例，在有关干部中批判贪多冒进的思想和不积极作准备工作的依赖等待思想，以及批判不进行调查研究，不考虑国家需要，而盲目确定建厂计划与产品方案的粗枝大叶作风。
    其次，继续壮大与健全设计力量，并加强设计计划与组织领导，以保证今年设计任务的及时完成和明年施工工作的顺利进行。特别对委托苏联设计所需资料的搜集工作，务须做到按时准备妥当。为此，必须继续集中设计力量，并培养专业设计人员与工程地质、测量、土壤分析等专业技术干部，同时迅速按工程规模大小，主要次要，编列设计工作进度表，通过设计工作中好坏具体实例，对设计人员进行思想教育，一方面鼓励进步的，另一方面则必须批判与克服某些设计人员中的资产阶级观点和不负责任的错误设计，号召和组织大家认真地学习苏联的先进经验。
    再次，在施工工作中，应着重注意：在施工前，认真审查设计和施工图纸的质量，防止由于设计错误而发生的返工浪费现象；有领导地揭露施工无计划，管理混乱和无人负责现象，建立施工工作中的计划管理和责任制度；及时进行工程质量的检查，通过群众性的检查，建立与健全技术管理制度，确保工程质量；建立财务管理制度，争取按期做出预算决算。上述工作应根据各地工程开工时间不同有步骤地分期进行。在进行过程中，应注意采取以先进带动落后及奖励与批评相结合的工作方法。
    最后，为了使基本建设力量的增长，能够适应今后基本建设任务日益增长的需要，必须有计划地提高现有技术人员和熟练工人的技术水平，改善中等技术学校、技工学校、技术训练班的工作，大力培养建设的后备力量。加强企业中的思想工作和政治工作
    为了保证上述任务的完成，必须加强企业中的思想工作和政治工作，使全体职工了解工作的意义，工作的方针以及完成工作任务的方法，这样才有可能使广大群众发挥高度的积极性和创造性，为完成和超额完成国家任务而奋斗。因此，任何忽视和放弃思想工作和政治工作的作法，是完全错误的，它只有使我们的工作遭受失败。企业中的思想工作和政治工作，应该密切围绕企业的生产和基本建设的中心任务而进行，并通过具体地深入地检查工作，揭发克服我们工作中的毛病和错误，以此来教育和提高全体职工的觉悟，使政治工作和经济工作相结合。在这一方面，国内不少先进企业已创造了良好的经验，所有国营机械企业的领导干部都应该学习这种工作方法。这样才能使我们成为具有政治头脑的经济工作者，而不是狭隘的事务主义者和短视的经济工作者；才能使我们逐渐懂得业务，成为内行，具体切实地领导企业，而不是“一般的”“从空中” 领导企业；也只有这样，才能克服我们在企业领导上的官僚主义，提高企业管理的领导水平。
