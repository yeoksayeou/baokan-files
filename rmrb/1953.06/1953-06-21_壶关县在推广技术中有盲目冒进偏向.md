    Hukuan County, Shanxi Province, exhibits blind and impetuous tendencies in promoting agricultural production technology, affecting the normal progress of this work. This bias is mainly reflected in the promotion of new agricultural tools, where there is a desire to do too much too quickly. The entire county only promoted 800 walking plows in the past three years, but in the first quarter of this year alone, it attempted to promote more than 1,600. This sudden increase in the number of promotions this year is not based on an increase in actual needs, but is due to the desire of the cadres in charge of this work in the county to do too much too quickly. They blindly believed that "the old liberated areas have a good foundation, and universal promotion is not a problem," and subjectively determined such a large number. Because this promotion plan was not based on actual needs, it had to be "pushed" down level by level from the county to the district to the village using administrative orders. As a result, some walking plows were "pushed" to farmers without livestock or to mutual aid groups without livestock, and some were "pushed" to farmers who simply did not want to use this type of plow. The walking plows that were promoted were either hung on the wall or placed on the shed. In areas where cadres monitored and forced their use, they were brought to the fields but left idle at the edge of the field.

    As a result of such promotion, although a certain number was completed, the effect achieved was very small. This spring, Guo Jiajie Village was "pushed" eight walking plows, but only used the walking plows to cultivate three mu of land in the entire spring.

    In previous years, the Hukuan area planted Golden Queen corn with 800 to 900 plants per mu. This year, the county requires the masses to increase this to 1,500 to 3,000 plants, an increase of two to three times at once. Some people promote "bold close planting" and "the denser the better," and everyone has a different opinion, leaving the masses confused and unsure of what to do. In terms of fertilization, there is a blind advocacy of excessive application. Last year, some farmers had a bumper harvest, but after calculating the accounts, they found it was not worth it, and exclaimed, "We can't afford a bumper harvest." (Zhao Rongzu)

    壶关县在推广技术中有盲目冒进偏向
    山西省壶关县在推广农业生产技术中有盲目冒进的偏向，影响了这一工作的正常开展。这种偏向主要表现在推广新式农具工作上贪多图快。全县在过去三年中才推广了八百部步犁，可是在今年第一季度中就企图推广一千六百多部。今年推广数字的骤增，不是根据实际需要的增加，而是由于该县主管这一工作的干部有贪多图快的思想。他们盲目地认为“老区基础好，普遍推广没有问题”，就主观主义地确定了那样大的数字。因为这推广计划不是根据实际需要产生的，所以在执行中就不得不用行政命令的方式由县而区而村逐级“推”下去。这样做的结果，有些步犁“推”给了没有牲口的农民或是没有牲口的互助组，有些“推”给了根本不愿使用这种步犁的农民。推广下去的步犁，有的被挂在墙上，有的被放在棚上，在干部监视非使用不可的地区，就被带到地里闲放在地头上。
    这样的推广的结果，虽然完成了一定的数字，可是收到的效果却小得很。郭家碣村今春被“推”去步犁八部，一春天才用步犁耕了三亩地。
    往年壶关一带种金皇后玉茭，每亩种八九百棵，今年县里要求群众增加到一千五百棵到三千棵，一下子增加两三倍。有些人宣传“大胆密植”“越密越好”，而且一个人一个说法，弄得群众昏头昏脑，不知如何是好。在施肥方面，盲目提倡多施，去年有些农民丰产了，可是一算帐，不够本，大叫“丰产丰不起”。（赵荣祖）
