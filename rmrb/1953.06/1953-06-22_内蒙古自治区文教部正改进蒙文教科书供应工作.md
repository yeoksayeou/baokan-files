    Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Cultural and Education Department is Improving Mongolian Textbook Supply Work
    Letter from the Cultural and Education Department of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region People's Government: In the past years, there have indeed been many shortcomings in the supply of Mongolian textbooks in our region. For example, the supply was neither timely, nor were the textbooks printed well. The reasons are: in the past, there was a shortage of editors, who could not prepare manuscripts in time. After 1952, the problem of the shortage of editors was solved, but there was still a lack of printing capacity (many Mongolian publications are crowded into the Inner Mongolia Daily Printing Factory for printing, which is really too busy. At the same time, the Mongolian type used by the factory to print textbooks has been used for a long time, and the printed books are not clear). This problem has not been solved for a long time, which has a great impact on school teaching.
    This year, we have discussed this issue with the Inner Mongolia Daily Printing Factory. The factory has decided to increase printing capacity and replace the old type. In addition, we have discussed with the Inner Mongolia People's Publishing House the issue of distinguishing between priorities in publishing books and periodicals in the future. This year, because the Inner Mongolia Daily is working on improving production, it is estimated that the textbooks for autumn may be published later; but from next year, this phenomenon will be overcome.
    The supply of elementary school textbooks in the spring of 1953 was generally not late, only in areas with inconvenient transportation may it have been later. According to our preliminary investigation, the reasons for the late supply of Mongolian textbooks in Horqin Middle Banner are as follows: the Xinhua Bookstore Mengsui Branch notified the branches of each banner and county in November of last year to report the number of textbooks ordered before December 15. However, Horqin Middle Banner did not report to the Mengsui Branch until February 10 of this year; and the numbers reported only included textbooks for junior high school and part of the textbooks for higher elementary school. It was not until the Inner Mongolia People's Publishing House learned about the shortage of textbooks in the banner that the Mengsui Branch urged and inquired, and the branch of the banner sent the supplementary order forms for Mongolian textbooks for junior elementary and part of higher elementary school in early April. Therefore, we believe that this problem is mainly caused by the Horqin Middle Banner Cultural and Education Section and the bookstore of the banner not being conscientious and responsible in carrying out the ordering work.

### 内蒙古自治区文教部正改进蒙文教科书供应工作

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    内蒙古自治区文教部正改进蒙文教科书供应工作
    内蒙古自治区人民政府文教部来信：我区蒙文教科书的供应工作，历年来的确有很多缺点。如供应既不及时，课本印得又不好。其原因是：过去编辑人员缺乏，不能及时编稿，至一九五二年后编辑人员缺乏问题解决了，但又缺乏印刷力量（蒙文刊物很多，都挤在内蒙古日报社印刷厂印刷，该厂实在忙不过来。同时该厂印教科书用的蒙文铅字使用日久，印出来的书不清楚）。这个问题长期未能解决，对学校教学工作实在有很大影响。
    今年我们已和内蒙古日报社印刷厂研究过这个问题。该厂决定增加印刷力量，并更换旧铅字。另外，我们和内蒙古人民出版社研究了今后出版书刊时分清轻重缓急的问题。今年因内蒙古日报正着手改进生产，估计秋季用的教科书可能要晚出一些；但从明年起，这种现象就会克服。
    一九五三年春季小学课本的供应一般并不晚，仅有交通不便地区可能晚些。科左中旗蒙文教科书供应过晚，据我们初步调查，原因如下：新华书店蒙绥分店在去年十一月通知各旗、县支店在十二月十五日前将预订教科书数目上报。但科左中旗却到今年二月十日才报到蒙绥分店；且所报数字只有初中用的课本和高小用的一部分课本。直到内蒙古人民出版社了解到该旗教科书缺乏的情况后，经蒙绥分店催询，该旗支店才在四月初寄来补订初小的和高小一部分的蒙文课本订货单。因此，我们认为：这个问题主要是科左中旗文教科和该旗书店没有认真负责进行预订工作所造成的。
