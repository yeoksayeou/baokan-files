Liaoxi Provincial Cooperative Union Liu Yulin's letter: The Supply Section of the Tai'an County Cooperative Union has been actively processing the cold stock of various basic-level cooperatives since 1953, achieving considerable success and gaining some experience.

	They adopted the method of mutual exchange of goods between basic-level cooperatives, turning some "cold goods" into "hot goods." For example, the Sandaogou Village Cooperative in the Second District got too much ginger, which they couldn't sell, but they lacked the cotton (floss) needed by the farmers. The Datai Village Cooperative in the Second District had a surplus of cotton purchased last year after selling it throughout the winter, but ginger was needed by the farmers. The Yangshu Village Cooperative in the First District had two bolts of blue serge that they couldn't sell; the Daniumura Cooperative in the Fifth District lacked blue serge. They exchanged the goods, solving the problem of stockpiled cold goods. The directors of the basic-level cooperatives all said that this method solved the problem.

	Many basic-level cooperatives have adopted the method of processing "cold goods" before reselling them, which is also very effective. The Central Cooperative in the Third District had two bolts of yellow khaki cloth stockpiled last year, which they couldn't sell for a year; this year, the cooperative made these cloths into trousers, which quickly sold out. The Central Cooperative in the Sixth District made unsold cloth scraps into underpants, which quickly sold out. Some cooperatives have made cloth scraps into hats, insoles, and tops, which have also sold quickly.

	Taking the initiative to find customers during sales is also a good method. The Central Cooperative in the Sixth District took cloth scraps to the market to sell, which was very popular with the farmers, resulting in the sale of more than 400 feet. The Sandaogou Basic-Level Cooperative in the Second District couldn't sell its bed sheets, so it entrusted the Central Cooperative in the district to sell them on commission at the Daji market, and they were sold. The Liujianfang Cooperative took a batch of stockpiled notebooks to the school to sell, which was also very popular with the students.

### 辽西台安县各基层合作社积极处理冷货取得一些经验

    辽西台安县各基层合作社积极处理冷货取得一些经验
    辽西省合作社联合社刘玉林来信：台安县合作社联合社供应科从一九五三年开始积极处理各基层社的冷货，有了不少成绩，并取得了一些经验。
    他们采取各基层社间互相换货的办法，使某些“冷货”变成“热货”。如二区三道沟村合作社广姜进得太多了，卖不出去，但却缺少农民需要的棉花（絮花）。二区大台村合作社去年采购来的棉花卖了一冬季，还有积压，但广姜却为农民所需要。一区杨树村合作社存两匹蓝大呢卖不出去；五区达牛合作社却缺蓝大呢。他们交换了货物，就解决了积压冷货的问题。各基层社主任们都说这个办法解决问题。
    不少基层社采取的把“冷货”加工后再推销的办法，也是很有效的。三区中心社去年积压两匹黄卡叽，卖了一年也没卖出去；今年该社把这些布做成裤子，很快就全卖出去了。六区中心社把卖不出去的布头做成裤衩，很快就卖光了。有的合作社把布头做成帽子、鞋垫、上衣等，也都卖得很快。
    在推销时主动找顾主也是一个好办法。六区中心社把布头拿到集上去卖，很受农民欢迎，结果卖出四百多尺。二区三道沟基层合作社的床单销不出去，委托该区中心社在大集镇代销，就卖掉了。六间房合作社把积压的一批笔记本主动拿到学校去卖，也很受学生的欢迎。
