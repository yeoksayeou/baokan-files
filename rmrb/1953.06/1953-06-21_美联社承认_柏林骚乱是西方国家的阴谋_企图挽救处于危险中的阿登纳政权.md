Xinhua News Agency, Bonn, June 20th: The German News Agency pointed out from Bonn on the 19th that the Associated Press's commentary on the provocative incidents stirred up by special agents in the democratic area of Berlin admitted that this incident was a conspiracy by Western countries and West German rulers aimed at countering "the recent Russian peace offensive in a critical period in Europe." The Associated Press admitted that the measures newly adopted by the German Democratic Republic, aimed at improving the people's living standards and consolidating the people's legitimate rights, alarmed the warmongers in West Germany and West Berlin, as well as their foreign masters, who therefore sought a way out by creating provocative incidents. The Associated Press said: "Until June 17th, the impression was that the Soviet Union's policies of reconciliation in Austria and East Germany, as well as other places, were making Western European countries uneasy. The pro-American Chancellor of West Germany, therefore, found himself in a precarious situation. Adenauer's entire plan to merge West Germany into the Western defense line was in danger of collapsing, and many people feared that these plans were practically finished."

The German News Agency pointed out that the Associated Press, therefore, admitted that the purpose of the provocative incidents in Berlin was to prevent the danger faced by the Adenauer regime.

    美联社承认
    柏林骚乱是西方国家的阴谋
    企图挽救处于危险中的阿登纳政权
    【新华社二十日讯】德意志通讯社波恩十九日电指出：美联社关于特务分子在柏林民主区所煽起的挑衅事件的评论承认，这次事件是西方国家和西德统治者阴谋布置的，目的在对付“最近俄国在欧洲的危急时期所发动的和平攻势”。美联社承认，德意志民主共和国新近采取的，目的在于提高人民生活水平和巩固人民的合法权利的措施，使西德和西柏林的战争贩子们以及他们的外国主子们感到惊慌，他们因此想从制造挑衅事件中找寻出路。美联社说：“直到六月十七日为止，人们的印象是，苏联在奥地利和东德以及其他地方所实行的和好政策使得西欧国家坐立不安。西德亲美的总理因此发现他自己处在一种风雨飘摇的形势之中。阿登纳的使西德合并到西方防御阵线中去的整个计划都有垮台的危险，有许多人担心，这些计划实际上算是完蛋了。”
    德意志通讯社指出，美联社因此承认了，在柏林发生的挑衅事件的目的是防备阿登纳政权所面临的危险。
