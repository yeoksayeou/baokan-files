The Korean people have waged a three-year struggle to defend the independence, freedom, and honor of their motherland against foreign invaders.

The imperialist armed invaders began the war of aggression in order to annex Korea, turn it into a colony, and turn the Korean people into their slaves. All the facts that have occurred during the war prove that the war aims of the imperialist armed invaders are more than just that. In waging war in Korea, the enemy is not simply satisfied with occupying this small country of Korea, but has more "grand" and "large-scale" goals, namely: after occupying Korea, the enemy attempts to invade Chinese territory and then expand the war to the entire East and the world. In order to realize this goal, the US imperialist armed invaders mobilized the elite main force of their land, sea, and air forces to the Korean battlefield, and also drove some forces from seventeen vassal states other than Syngman Rhee to the battlefield against the Korean people.

In its war of aggression against the Korean people, US imperialism used the most barbaric war methods and means rarely seen in the history of war. In the Korean War, the US imperialist armed invaders used all the war methods and means that they could and had. However, the US imperialists did not achieve their goals in the aggressive war waged in Korea. They suffered a terrible defeat in their bloody history of aggression, the likes of which they had never suffered before.

In the three years of the Fatherland Liberation War, the Korean people, with the assistance of the heroic Chinese People's Volunteers, achieved a great victory.

In the course of the three-year war, the Korean people, under the leadership of their great leader Marshal Kim Il-sung, demonstrated boundless heroism, dedication, and tenacity, which proved that the "technical superiority" that the US imperialists once clamored about and their most barbaric war methods could not subdue or intimidate the Korean people.

The heroic Korean people have triumphed in the difficult war against the heavily armed US and British armed invaders.

The course of the three-year cruel war has made the enemy understand how infinite and powerful the strength of the Korean people is, and how heroic the Korean people are.

The course of the three-year war has demonstrated the incomparably powerful viability and superiority of the people's democratic system created by the Korean people in the northern half of the Republic.

As the Korean War has fully and clearly demonstrated, the imperialist ringleaders—the American billionaires—who consider themselves "world rulers," cannot arbitrarily infringe upon weak nations even today.

The "prestige" of the US imperialists who vainly attempted to "dominate the world" has never been lowered as it has been in the three-year war of aggression against Korea.

US and British imperialists have suffered a tragic military, political, and moral defeat in the Korean War.

The heroic Korean people endured all sacrifices, pain, and disasters, fought to defend the independence, freedom, and honor of their motherland, and defeated the enemy.

What is the victory that the Korean people have won in the three years of the Fatherland Liberation War? And what does this victory mean?

First, the Korean people and their armed forces—the Korean People's Army—fighting side by side with the fraternal Chinese People's Volunteers, defended the democratic base—the revolutionary base—established by the liberated Korean people in the northern half of our motherland from the clutches of foreign armed invaders. In this way, the Korean people have defended the people's democratic system they have built with their own hands and the achievements of various democratic reforms.

The fact that the Korean people have defended the democratic revolutionary base is indeed a great victory of great significance. As Marshal Kim Il-sung, the beloved leader of the Korean people, once said: "With our heroic struggle, we defend the people's democratic system and democratic base won by the Korean people. As in the past, this base has the conditions to continue to strengthen the political, military, economic, and cultural democratic revolutionary forces, and has the conditions to strive for the greatest desire of our Korean people—the complete unification and independence of the motherland."

Second, these three years of the Fatherland Liberation War have been a severe and practical test for the Korean people, the Party, the people's regime, and the people's army. The Korean people, the Party, the people's regime, and the people's army were able to withstand this practical test, pass this test, and grow, strengthen, and temper themselves infinitely.

The cadres of the Party, the regime, and the army have also grown and tempered themselves infinitely in the cruel war test. They are armed with the rich experience accumulated in the war test. They are armed with the iron will and working ability to complete their sacred tasks in any complex and difficult environment and conditions.

The combatants and commanders of the Korean People's Army have accumulated rich and valuable experience in the struggle against the leader of imperialism—the US imperialist aggressors. Through the war, they have trained thousands upon thousands of skilled commanders. They are able to command the coordinated operations of various arms of the services equipped with modern technology in any complex and difficult environment and conditions.

As Marshal Kim Il-sung has pointed out, the rich experience we have gained in the course of the Fatherland Liberation War is a very precious treasure, it is our capital for building a strong and prosperous democratic and independent country, and it is the most valuable guarantee for rapidly restoring and developing our war-torn motherland and bringing endless prosperity and happiness to our country and people.

Today, Korea has thousands upon thousands of national cadres who have been tempered in the cruel war and are armed with rich experience. They not only guarantee the victory of the liberation war, but also ensure the victory of our cause of building a unified, democratic, autonomous, and independent country.

Third, in the course of the three-year Korean War, the US armed aggressors encountered the great strength of the Korean people and its armed forces—the heroic Korean People's Army and the fraternal Chinese People's Volunteers united like steel, and suffered tragic military, political, and moral defeats. The "power" of the US imperialists and their myth of "technical superiority" have been shattered. The hypocrisy and barbaric essence of the "American way of life" and American-style "democracy" that they have clamored about, and their vicious true colors, have also been exposed nakedly.

Lenin once said: The ideal democratic republic of the United States is the most arrogant form of imperialism, and the most shameless form of oppression and killing of oppressed nations. Lenin's words have been fully and most shamefully confirmed in the Korean War. The veil that conceals the true face of the American billionaires can no longer exist in the world. The hundreds of billions of dollars that American billionaires have seized in the three years of the Korean War are stained with the blood of the Korean people, and this is the essence and content of the "American way of life."

Today, all the crimes committed by the US imperialists in the Korean War have judged them to be the vicious enemies of human conscience and civilization, and the most vicious enemies of humanitarianism, democracy, and human peace and security.

The US imperialists have suffered not only a military defeat in the Korean War, but also a tragic political and moral defeat.

The victory of the Korean people in the Fatherland Liberation War proves that as long as a nation is determined to safeguard its independence and freedom and is loyal to the banner of Lenin and Stalin's internationalism, no aggressive force in the world will be able to enslave it.

The heroic struggle of the Korean people against the aggressors has become a victorious banner for the national liberation struggles of all oppressed peoples around the world.

Fourth, the defeat of the US imperialists in the Korean War is not only a great victory for the Korean people, but also a great victory for the peace-loving democratic camp around the world.

The course of the Korean War clearly shows that today, any aggressive force in the world is powerless in the face of the unity and solidarity of the socialist and democratic camp headed by the great Soviet Union, the great China, and the people's democratic countries. There is no force in the world that can stand against or infringe upon this camp and win.

Marshal Kim Il-sung pointed out: "The Korean War shows that the camp of peace, democracy, and socialism, which is stronger than the imperialist camp, is blocking the path of the imperialist plunderers and crushing their anti-people plans." Today, the leader of the world's reactionary forces and aggressive forces—the US imperialists—has deeply recognized, and cannot but recognize, this lesson in the Korean War.

Through the Korean War, the invincible power of the peace-loving democratic camp around the world, headed by the great Soviet Union, has become stronger. On the contrary, the imperialist aggressive camp is becoming weaker. Their internal contradictions have become more acute. The chronic crisis of capitalism has also become more profound.

The united combat power of the heroic Korean People's Army and the fraternal Chinese People's Volunteers dealt a fatal blow to the US and British imperialist aggressors, shattered their aggressive plans against Korea and their attempts to provoke a new world war, and made a great contribution to the great cause of safeguarding peace and security in the Far East and the world.

Comrade Mao Zedong, the great leader of the Chinese people, pointed out: "The heroic struggle of the Korean people for the independence and liberation of their motherland and against the US imperialist aggressors has made a great contribution to the cause of saving world peace."

So, what is the reason for the great victory of the Korean people in the Fatherland Liberation War?

First of all, it lies in the heroism, sacrifice, tenacious perseverance, and indomitable fighting will and strength of the Korean people.

The Korean people's experience of prolonged colonial slavery under Japanese imperialism awakened them to go to the sacred battle against the American aggressors who wanted to enslave them again.

The liberated Korean people will never allow any aggressors to drive the Korean people into the same poverty, darkness, and lack of rights as in the past.

The Korean War clearly shows that no aggressive force in the world can conquer the Korean people who are the masters of the liberated motherland. They have the power in their hands and are determined to safeguard the freedom, rights, and happiness they have won. They also have the glorious and reliable people's armed forces—the Korean People's Army.

Any difficulties and sacrifices in the war cannot stop the Korean people from fighting to defend their land, factories, and all the fruits of labor, and to fight against the aggressors, nor can they hinder the victory of the Korean people.

The second reason is that the liberated Korean people created a solid democratic base—a revolutionary base—in the northern half of the Republic, and at the same time enabled it to become an unbreakable fortress in the struggle for the peaceful reunification of the motherland and in the liberation struggle against foreign aggressors, and to become the reliable rear of the glorious Korean people's armed forces—the Korean People's Army—which fought against the armed aggressors.

The course of the war is a demonstration of the results of the Korean people's long-term anti-Japanese struggle; it is a demonstration of the superiority of the people's democratic system created by the liberated Korean people with creative hands and their infinite viability.

The enemy's sudden attack on our democratic people's republic not only did not weaken, but rather strengthened the unified will and combat strength of the Korean people united on the basis of the worker-peasant alliance. At the same time, the ravages of war not only did not disintegrate the Korean people united in the big family of the democratic system, but instead formed them into an iron fighting fortress.

The deeper the difficulties and disasters in the war, the deeper the Korean people's trust in their Republic government and all the organizers and inspirers of victory—the Korean Workers' Party. The ravages of war have made the Korean people more closely united around their beloved leader Marshal Kim Il-sung, the Republic government, and the Workers' Party.

In order to resist the enemy's most barbaric war methods against the Korean people, the Korean people resolutely relied on the people's democratic system, which is the crystallization and embodiment of their freedom, happiness, and rights obtained after liberation, and its executor, and fought. At the same time, victory can only be achieved by relying on the people's infinite viability.

In the period of peaceful construction of the Korean people—the period of fighting to create a new motherland—the superiority of the people's democratic system has been fully reviewed. But the war has put this system to a more severe test.

The cruel war proves that the people's democratic system is the most superior system that can withstand any severe test. It can not only mobilize and organize the people to victory in the struggle of peaceful construction, but also in the struggle against and elimination of foreign aggressors.

Again, the Korean people, fighting against the US armed aggressors, as a link in the peace-loving democratic camp, have received reliable and warm support and assistance in this camp.

The Korean people's heroic struggle against the US armed aggressors has won the infinite support, love, and assistance of peace-loving people all over the world. The voices of hundreds of millions of kind people around the world supporting the heroic Korean people who are fighting against foreign aggressors are exposing and condemning every aggressive crime of the US war instigators. Can the enemy pretend not to know in the face of such facts?

The people of the fraternal countries of the democratic camp, headed by the great Soviet people, sincerely assisted the liberation war of the heroic Korean people in spirit and material.

The spiritual and material assistance given to us by the people of the great Soviet Union, China, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Mongolia, the German Democratic Republic, Albania, and other countries is the source of strength for the Korean people who are fighting against foreign aggressors, and one of the basic conditions for guaranteeing victory. Are the enemies still qualified to say that they have "isolated" and "blockaded" us? It is not the Korean people and the Chinese people who are isolated, but the US imperialists who are waging a barbaric war of aggression against the Korean people. The record of the Americans being so unpopular with people all over the world today is unprecedented in history.

The great Chinese people, for their own safety, to assist the Korean people's liberation war, and to fight together with the Korean people against the US imperialist aggressors. The heroic Chinese People's Volunteers, composed of the sons and daughters of the great Chinese people, and the Korean People's Army are fighting together against the common enemy—the US imperialist armed aggressors, which is one of the basic conditions for guaranteeing the victory of the Korean people.

The fighting friendship and unity formed by the people of Korea and China in the struggle against the common enemy—foreign aggressors—is a new form of mutual assistance and unity among the people of democratic countries in defending their independence, freedom, and human peace. It guarantees the victory of the common struggle of the people of democratic countries.

Marshal Kim Il-sung said: "The participation of the Chinese People's Volunteers in the Korean front has great significance in the moral relationship of historical friendship between the Korean and Chinese peoples, in consolidating national defense, and in maintaining world peace and security, especially peace and security in the Far East; and it is a clear manifestation of the noble internationalism newly formed in human society after the victory of the great Russian socialist October Revolution."

The process of the Korean people's liberation war against the US imperialist armed aggressors very clearly proves that the era in which the imperialists divided the weak nations and then used the method of defeating them one by one to carry out their arbitrary aggressive plans has long passed.

This is the basic and simple conclusion of the Korean people's three-year Fatherland Liberation War.

The US imperialists are planning to create the danger of a breakdown in the armistice in the final stages of achieving an armistice in Korea.

Thanks to the sincerity and patient efforts of our Korean and Chinese governments to achieve an armistice in Korea and a peaceful solution to the Korean issue, and with the unanimous wishes and support of kind people all over the world, the day of achieving an armistice in Korea is at hand.

Although the enemy has agreed to a final solution to the issue of prisoner repatriation, which has been delayed for two years due to their absurd demands and stubbornness, according to our fair and reasonable suggestions, they have then begun to backtrack. Only a few days after both sides signed an agreement on the issue of prisoner repatriation, they broke the agreement and attempted to realize their original absurd conspiracy to forcibly detain our captured personnel.

The Korean people are watching with boundless indignation the enemy's sinister, despicable, and clumsy trick to try to undermine the Korean armistice again.

If the enemy really wants to continue the Korean War and wants to expand it, then they must bear the consequences completely themselves.

The experience of the three-year Korean War very clearly shows what this adventure of the enemy will bring them? The enemy should realize that the result is nothing but a more tragic failure?

The Korean people clearly know that with their own powerful power, they are able to defend the independence and freedom of their motherland from the clutches of the aggressors.

The experience of the Korean War once again confirms that a nation that fights for the independence and freedom of its motherland cannot survive without the people's armed forces.

The Korean people are strengthening their glorious armed forces—the Korean People's Army—in every possible way, defending the democratic base of the motherland from the enemy's infringement, reliably defending their freedom, rights, land, factories, and all the fruits of labor; and cherish and support the people's armed forces that defend all of this like their own eyes, and are making every effort to make them grow stronger.

The experience of the Korean War clearly shows that no matter which nation, if it does not unite closely in the peace-loving democratic camp headed by the great Soviet Union today, then it will not have independence, freedom, and survival.

The experience of the Korean War clearly shows that if the Korean people can be more loyal to the banner of Lenin and Stalin's internationalism, if they can further consolidate the friendship and unity with the great Soviet Union, the great Chinese people, and the people of all people's democratic countries, then they will surely win in the future as they have won in the past.

The Korean people will make greater efforts to further strengthen the friendly unity with the people of fraternal countries.

In the just war against the common enemy of the Korean and Chinese peoples—the US armed aggressors, the friendship and friendly unity of our Korean and Chinese peoples have become more consolidated and developed.

The Korean people will never forget the sincere assistance given to us by the great Chinese people and their great leader Comrade Mao Zedong in the course of our arduous Fatherland Liberation War.

The Korean people will further consolidate and develop the friendly unity with the fraternal Chinese people. The Korean people will always stand with the Chinese people and fight together forever in the struggle against the common enemy—foreign aggressors—and for a happy future.

No aggressive force in the world can stop the power of our Korean and Chinese peoples uniting in the common struggle for their rights, happiness, security, and peace from moving forward!

    朝鲜人民的祖国解放战争三周年
    朝鲜劳动党中央委员会书记　朴正爱
    朝鲜人民为捍卫自己祖国的独立、自由和荣誉、反对外国侵略者而进行了三年的斗争。
    帝国主义武装侵略者为了并吞朝鲜，变朝鲜为其殖民地，变朝鲜人民为其奴隶而开始进行侵略战争。战争中发生的全部事实证明，帝国主义武装侵略者的战争目的，还不仅仅是这样。敌人在朝鲜进行战争，不是单纯地以占领朝鲜这个小的国家为满足，而具有更为“远大的”和“大规模的”目的，即：敌人企图在占领朝鲜以后，侵入中国领土，进而把战争扩大到整个东方和全世界。为了实现这种目的，美帝国主义武装侵略者把他们的陆、海、空军的精锐主力动员到朝鲜战场，并且把除了李承晚以外的十七个仆从国家的一些兵力也驱入反对朝鲜人民的战场。
    美帝国主义者为反对朝鲜人民而进行了侵略战争，并使用了在战争史上甚为少见的最野蛮的战争方法和手段。在朝鲜战争中，美帝国主义武装侵略者使用了他们能够作到的和具有的一切战争方法和手段。但是，美帝国主义者在朝鲜进行的侵略战争中，没有达到他们的目的。他们遭到了在其流血的侵略战史上的从未遭受过的惨败。
    在三年来的祖国解放战争中，朝鲜人民得到了英雄的中国人民志愿军的援助，取得了伟大的胜利。
    在三年来的战争进程中，朝鲜人民在自己的伟大领袖金日成元帅的领导下，发挥了无限的英勇性、献身性和坚韧性，这证明了：美帝国主义者曾经叫嚣的“技术优势”和他们的最野蛮的战争方法，都是屈服不了和吓不倒朝鲜人民的。
    英雄的朝鲜人民，在与武装到牙齿的美英武装侵略者进行的艰难的战争中胜利了。
    三年来的残酷的战争进程，使敌人懂得：朝鲜人民的力量是怎样的无穷无尽，是多么的强大，朝鲜人民又是如何英勇的人民。
    三年来的战争进程，显示了共和国北半部的朝鲜人民所创建的人民民主制度的无比强大的生存力及其具有的优越性。
    如同朝鲜战争所充分而清楚地证明了的一样，以“世界支配者”自居的帝国主义魁首——美国的亿万富翁们，到今天也已不能任意地侵犯弱小的民族了。
    妄想“制霸世界”的美帝国主义者的“威信”，从来没有像它在三年来的侵朝战争中这样地降低过。
    美英帝国主义者，在朝鲜战争中遭到了军事、政治和道德上的悲惨失败。
    英雄的朝鲜人民忍受着一切牺牲、痛苦和灾难，为保卫祖国的独立、自由和荣誉而进行了斗争，并且战胜了敌人。
    朝鲜人民在三年来的祖国解放战争中所争取到的胜利是什么？这个胜利又意味着什么呢？
    第一，朝鲜人民及其武装力量——朝鲜人民军和兄弟般的中国人民志愿军并肩作战，从外国武装侵略者的魔掌中保卫了解放后的朝鲜人民在我们祖国北半部建立起来的民主基地——革命根据地。这样，朝鲜人民就保卫了自己亲手建立起来的人民民主制度和民主改革的各项成果。
    朝鲜人民保卫了民主革命根据地的事实，确实是巨大的而具有重大意义的胜利。朝鲜人民的敬爱领袖金日成元帅曾说过：“我们以自己的英勇斗争，保卫朝鲜人民所争取的人民民主制度和民主基地。像过去一样，在这个基地上具备了能够继续加强政治、军事、经济和文化的民主革命力量的条件，并具备了能够争取我们朝鲜人民的最大宿愿——祖国的完全统一独立的条件。”
    第二，这三年的祖国解放战争，是对朝鲜人民、党、人民政权和人民军队的严峻而实际的考验。朝鲜人民、党、人民政权和人民军队，能够经得起这个实际的考验，通过这个考验并无限地成长、加强和锻炼了。
    党、政权和军队的干部们在残酷的战争考验中，也无限地成长和锻炼了。他们以在战争考验中所积累起来的丰富经验武装起来了。他们以在任何复杂与困难的环境和条件下都能完成他们神圣任务的钢铁般的意志和工作能力武装起来了。
    朝鲜人民军的战斗员和指挥官，在与帝国主义的魁首——美帝国主义侵略者的战斗中，积累了丰富的和宝贵的经验。通过战争，并培养了数千数万技术熟练的指挥官。他们在任何复杂和困难的环境和条件下，都能够指挥以现代化技术装备起来的各种兵种的协同作战。
    正如金日成元帅所指示的一样，我们在祖国解放战争过程中获得的丰富经验，是非常宝贵的宝物，是我们建设富强的民主主义独立国家的资本，是迅速恢复和发展遭受战争破坏的我们祖国并给我们国家和人民带来无穷无尽的繁荣和幸福的最可贵的保证。
    今天，朝鲜有着数千数万在残酷的战争中锻炼出来的并以丰富的经验武装起来的民族干部。他们不仅保障了解放战争的胜利，而且使我们建设统一的民主主义的自主独立国家的事业有了胜利的保证。
    第三，美国武装侵略者在三年来的朝鲜战争过程中，碰到了朝鲜人民和它的武装力量——英雄的朝鲜人民军及兄弟般的中国人民志愿军钢铁般地团结起来的伟大力量，在军事、政治和道德上都遭到了悲惨的失败。美帝国主义者的“强大”和它们关于“技术优势”的神话已被粉碎了。它们所叫嚣的“美国生活方式”和美国式的“民主”的虚伪、野蛮的本质和它们凶恶的真面貌，也已赤裸裸地被揭穿了。
    列宁曾经说过：以美国理想的民主共和国是最狂妄的帝国主义的形态，是对被压迫民族的最厚颜无耻的压迫和杀戮的形态。列宁这句话，在朝鲜战争中已被全面地和最可耻地证实了。掩饰美国亿万富翁真面貌的面幕，在世界上再也不能存在了。美国亿万富翁，在进行朝鲜战争三年以来所攫取的千百亿美元，上面都沾满了朝鲜人民的鲜血，这就是“美国生活方式”的本质与内容。
    今天，美帝国主义者在朝鲜战争中所制造的一切罪行，已使它们判自己成为人类良心与文明的凶恶敌人，成为人道主义、民主主义与人类和平及安全的最凶恶的敌人。
    美帝国主义者在朝鲜战争中不但在军事上遭到了失败，而且在政治与道德上也遭到了惨败。
    朝鲜人民在祖国解放战争中的胜利证实了：一个民族只要有决心维护自己的独立和自由，并忠实于列宁、斯大林的国际主义的旗帜，那么，世界上将没有任何的侵略势力能够奴役它。
    朝鲜人民反对侵略者的英雄斗争，已经成了全世界所有被压迫人民民族解放斗争的胜利旗帜。
    第四，美帝国主义者在朝鲜战争中遭到失败，不但是朝鲜人民取得的伟大胜利，而且是全世界爱好和平民主阵营的巨大胜利。
    朝鲜战争的过程清楚地显示了：今天世界上的任何侵略势力，在以伟大的苏联为首及伟大的中国和人民民主国家的社会主义和民主主义阵营的统一与团结的力量面前，都是无能为力的。世界上与这个阵营对立或者加以侵害而能胜利的势力，也是不存在的。　
    金日成元帅指出：“朝鲜战争表明了，比帝国主义阵营强大的和平民主和社会主义阵营在阻挡着帝国主义掠夺者们的进路，粉碎着它们反人民的计划。”今天，世界反动势力和侵略势力的头目——美帝国主义者，在朝鲜战争中已深刻地认识到，并不能不认识到这个教训。
    通过朝鲜战争，以伟大苏联为首的全世界爱好和平民主阵营的不可战胜的威力更加强大着。与此相反，帝国主义侵略阵营却更加削弱着。它们的内部矛盾已更加尖锐。资本主义慢性的危机也更加深刻化了。
    英雄的朝鲜人民军和兄弟般的中国人民志愿军的团结的战斗威力，致命地打击了美英帝国主义侵略者，粉碎了它们对朝鲜的侵略计划和挑拨新世界大战的企图，对于维护远东和世界和平与安全的伟大事业作了巨大的贡献。
    中国人民的伟大领袖毛泽东同志指出：“朝鲜人民为争取祖国独立解放、反对美帝国主义侵略者的英勇斗争，对拯救世界和平的事业作了巨大贡献。”
    那么朝鲜人民在祖国解放战争中取得伟大胜利的原因在那里呢？
    首先，在于朝鲜人民的英雄性、牺牲性、顽强的坚韧性和不屈不挠的斗争意志与力量。
       朝鲜人民在日本帝国主义统治下长期的殖民地奴隶生活的体验，唤起他们为对抗又要奴役他们的美国侵略者而走向神圣的战斗。
    解放了的朝鲜人民，决不容许任何的侵略者再把朝鲜人民驱入和过去同样贫困、黑暗与毫无权利的处境。
    朝鲜战争清楚地表明，世界上没有任何侵略势力能够征服作为解放了的祖国主人翁的朝鲜人民。他们在手里掌握了政权，并决心维护自己所争取到的自由、权利和幸福。他们并拥有光荣的和可靠的人民武装——朝鲜人民军。
    战争中的任何困难和牺牲，都阻挡不了朝鲜人民为维护自己的土地、工厂和一切劳动果实、为反对侵略者而战斗的道路，同时更妨害不了朝鲜人民的胜利。
    其次的原因，是在于解放了的朝鲜人民在共和国北半部创设了坚固的民主基地——革命根据地，同时使它能够成为在和平统一祖国的斗争中与反对外国侵略者的解放斗争中的牢不可破的堡垒，成为为反对武装侵略者而战的光荣的朝鲜人民的武装力量——朝鲜人民军的可靠的后方。
    战争的过程是朝鲜人民长期抗日斗争的结果的示威；是解放了的朝鲜人民以创造性的双手创建的人民民主制度的优越性及他们的无穷无尽的生活力的示威。
    敌人对我们民主主义人民共和国的突然的进攻，不仅削弱不了而且越发巩固了在工农联盟的基础上团结起来的朝鲜人民的统一的意志和战斗力量。同时，战争的惨祸不但瓦解不了团结在民主主义制度的大家庭里的朝鲜人民，却反而使他们结成了钢铁般的战斗堡垒。
    战争中的困难和灾害越是深重，朝鲜人民对自己的共和国政府和一切胜利的组织者、鼓舞者——朝鲜劳动党的信赖便越加深厚。战争的惨祸，使朝鲜人民更加紧密地团结在自己敬爱的领袖金日成元帅、共和国政府及劳动党的周围了。
    为了对抗敌人对朝鲜人民的最野蛮的战争方法，朝鲜人民坚决地依靠了作为自己在解放后所取得的自由幸福和权利的结晶与体现者及执行者的人民民主制度，进行了战斗。同时，也只有依靠人民无穷无尽的生活力才能取得胜利。
    在朝鲜人民的和平建设时期——为创建新的祖国而战斗的时期里，人民民主制度的优越性就已充分地受到了检阅。但战争却使这个制度经受了更严重的考验。
    残酷的战争证明：人民民主制度是能够经受任何严峻的考验的最优越的制度。它不但在和平建设的斗争中，而且在反对与消灭外国侵略者的斗争中，也能够很好的动员和组织人民走向胜利。
    再次，反对美国武装侵略者而战斗着的朝鲜人民作为爱好和平民主阵营的一环，在这个阵营里受到了可靠而热烈的声援和支持。
    朝鲜人民以自己反对美国武装侵略者的英雄斗争，获得了全世界爱好和平人民无限的支持、爱戴和援助。全世界千百万善良的人们声援为反对外国侵略者而战的英雄的朝鲜人民的呼声，在揭露和斥责着美国战争挑拨者的每一个侵略罪行。在这样的事实面前，敌人能佯作不知吗？
    以伟大的苏联人民为首的民主阵营的各兄弟国家人民，都在精神上和物质上诚挚地援助了英雄的朝鲜人民的解放战争。
    伟大的苏联、中国、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、匈牙利、罗马尼亚、保加利亚、蒙古、德意志民主共和国、阿尔巴尼亚等国家的人民给我们朝鲜人民的精神和物质上的援助，是为反对外国侵略者而战的朝鲜人民的力量的源泉，是保证胜利的基本条件之一。敌人还有资格说“孤立”和“封锁”了我们吗？被孤立的不是朝鲜人民和中国人民，而是反对朝鲜人民而进行野蛮的侵略战争的美帝国主义者。美国人今天在全世界人民面前如此不得人心的纪录，是历史上从未有过的。
    伟大的中国人民为了自己的安全，为了援助朝鲜人民的解放战争，为了反对美帝国主义侵略者和朝鲜人民一起共同作战。以伟大的中国人民的儿女组成的英雄的中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军一起，为反对共同敌人——美帝国主义武装侵略者而进行的斗争，是保证朝鲜人民的胜利的基本条件之一。
    朝、中两国人民在反对共同敌人——外国侵略者的战斗中所结成的战斗的友谊团结，是民主阵营各国人民在捍卫自己的独立、自由和人类和平的斗争中互相协助和团结的模范的新形态。它保证了民主阵营各国人民共同斗争的胜利。
    金日成元帅说：“中国人民志愿军的参加朝鲜战线，在中朝两国人民历史友谊的道义关系上、在巩固国防上、以及维护世界和平与安全特别是远东和平与安全上，有着巨大的意义；而且是伟大的俄国社会主义十月革命胜利以后，在人类社会上新形成的高尚的国际主义的鲜明表现。”
    朝鲜人民反对美帝国主义武装侵略者的解放战争的过程非常清楚地证明了帝国主义者在分化弱小民族之后再以各个击破的办法来进行它随心所欲的侵略计策的时期早已过去了。
    这便是朝鲜人民进行的三年祖国解放战争的基本而简单的结论。
    美帝国主义者正在作这样的策划，企图在实现朝鲜停战的最后阶段制造停战破裂的危险。
    由于我们朝中两国政府为实现朝鲜停战及和平解决朝鲜问题而表示的诚意和所作的有耐性的努力，在全世界善良人们的一致愿望和声援中，实现朝鲜停战的日子已在眼前了。
    敌方对于因他们荒谬的要求和固执而拖延了两年之久的战俘遣返问题，虽已同意根据我方公正而合理的建议作了最后的解决，但是他们接着又开始倒退了。他们在双方签订了关于战俘遣返问题的协议之后只不过几天，就破坏了这个协议，企图实现他们原来的强迫扣留我方被俘人员的荒唐阴谋。
    朝鲜人民正以无比的激愤，注视着敌方这种企图再次破坏朝鲜停战的阴险、卑鄙和拙劣的把戏。
    如果敌方真要继续朝鲜战争并想把它扩大的话，那么这个后果将必须完全由他们自己去承受。
    三年来的朝鲜战争的经验非常清楚地说明了，敌人的这种冒险究竟会给他们带来什么呢？敌人应该省悟到：其结果除了更悲惨的失败之外，难道还有别的吗？
    朝鲜人民清楚地知道，以自己强大的威力是能够从侵略者的魔手中捍卫自己祖国的独立和自由的。
    朝鲜战争的经验再一次证实了，为了自己祖国的独立和自由而战的民族，如没有人民的武装力量是不可能生存的。
    朝鲜人民用一切办法加强着自己光荣的武装力量——朝鲜人民军，从敌人的侵害中保卫着祖国的民主基地，可靠地保卫了自己的自由、权利、土地、工厂与所有的劳动果实；并且像对自己眼珠一样地爱护和支持着保卫这一切的人民武装力量，为了使它成长得更强大而作着一切的努力。
    朝鲜战争的经验清楚地表明了，不论那一个民族，今天如不紧紧地团结在以伟大的苏联为首的爱好和平的民主阵营中，那么它将不会有独立自由和生存。
    朝鲜战争的经验清楚地表明了，朝鲜人民如能更加忠实于列宁、斯大林的国际主义旗帜，如能更加巩固与以伟大的苏联为首及伟大的中国人民和各人民民主国家人民之间的友谊团结，那么正如同过去之获得胜利一样，将来也一定会胜利的。
    朝鲜人民将为更进一步地加强与兄弟般的友邦各国人民之间的友好团结而作更大的努力。
    在反对朝中两国人民共同敌人——美国武装侵略者的正义的战争中，我朝中两国人民的友谊和友好团结已越发巩固和发展了。
    朝鲜人民将永远不会忘记，伟大的中国人民及其伟大的领袖毛泽东同志，在我们艰困的祖国解放战争过程中给予我们的诚挚的援助。
    朝鲜人民将进一步巩固与发展和兄弟般的中国人民之间的友好团结。朝鲜人民在反对共同敌人——外国侵略者和争取未来幸福的斗争中，将和中国人民永远站在一起，永远一同斗争。
    世界上的任何侵略势力也不能阻挡我们朝中两国人民在为了自己的权利、幸福、安全与和平的共同斗争中团结起来的力量前进！
