    Central University of Finance and Economics, Department of Statistics, Faculty and Students Eager to Contribute to Population Census Work
    Letter from the entire faculty and students of the Department of Statistics, Central University of Finance and Economics: When we saw the "Instructions on Conducting a National Population Census Registration in Preparation for the General Election" and the "Measures for National Population Census Registration" issued by the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government, we were truly delighted. In order to actively respond to the national population census registration work, we, the entire faculty and students of the Department of Statistics, recently organized a study session and held a symposium. Through study and discussion, we have all deeply realized the great significance of this national population census registration. If we want to conduct a general election, we must first do a good job in the population census and voter registration so that every citizen can correctly exercise their right to vote. At the same time, the motherland has already begun its first great Five-Year Construction Plan, and economic and cultural construction will gradually become planned. This requires accurate calculations, and people and their needs are the main subjects of calculation. Therefore, this population census will also provide the necessary data for us to carry out various constructions in a planned way. From this, we realize that our country's population census is fundamentally different from the population census in capitalist countries. The purpose of population censuses in capitalist countries is to prepare for war, increase the taxes of the working people, and strengthen capitalist plunder. Our population census, however, is to protect the people's political rights and seek the people's happiness. This cannot but make us feel even more the loveliness of our motherland.
    We are all statistical workers, and we fully understand that accurate statistical work is of decisive significance for conducting a population census. Therefore, we are determined to contribute all our strength in this historically significant national population census registration work.

专栏：读者来信摘要

    中央财经学院统计系师生愿为人口调查工作贡献力量
    中央财经学院统计系全体师生来信：当我们看到中央人民政府政务院发布的“为准备普选进行全国人口调查登记的指示”和“全国人口调查登记办法”以后，真是高兴极了。为了以积极的行动迎接全国人口调查登记工作，最近我们统计系全体师生组织了一次学习，并召开了座谈会。经过学习和讨论，我们都深刻地认识到这次全国人口调查登记的重大意义。我们要进行普选，就必须首先作好人口调查和选民登记工作，使每一个公民都能正确地执行自己的选举权利。同时，祖国已经开始了第一个伟大的五年建设计划，经济和文化建设都将逐步走向计划化，这就要求有准确的计算，而人和人的需要就是主要的计算对象；因此，这次人口调查也将为我们有计划地进行各项建设提供必要的资料。从这里，我们体会到我国的人口调查是与资本主义国家的人口调查根本不相同的。资本主义国家进行人口调查的目的，是为了准备战争，增加劳动人民的赋税和加强资本主义的掠夺。而我们的人口调查，却是为保障人民的政治权利和谋求人民的幸福。这不能不使我们愈加感到祖国的可爱。
    我们都是统计工作者，我们十分懂得准确的统计工作对于进行人口调查是有决定性意义的，因此，我们决心在这次有历史意义的全国人口调查登记工作中贡献我们所有的力量。
