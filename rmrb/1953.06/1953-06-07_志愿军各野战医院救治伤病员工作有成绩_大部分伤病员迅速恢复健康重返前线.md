Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, June 6th: The Chinese People's Volunteer Army's field hospitals have made achievements in treating wounded and sick soldiers, enabling most of them to rapidly recover and return to the front lines after treatment.

　　In 1952, the cure rate for wounded and sick soldiers across the entire army was 96.6 percent. This is the result of the strong support from the people of the motherland and the frontline medical personnel and other staff members highly promoting the spirit of wholeheartedly serving the wounded and sick, overcoming difficulties, and working hard.

　　The medical staff of various field hospitals used their arduous labor to build many underground hospitals with ample sunshine and good ventilation for the wounded and sick soldiers, and whitewashed the walls and damp-proofed them with self-burned lime. The "Model Ward Campaign" initiated by female nurse Jin Changde is being widely carried out in various field hospitals. Nurses at a certain hospital collected scrap iron and pressed furnace bars themselves to make heated single beds for severely wounded soldiers. Staff at a certain hospital went up the mountains to cut a lot of kudzu vines and made more than one hundred comfortable soft beds like wire beds for the wounded and sick soldiers. Female nurses in various hospitals used every spare moment to clean up the wards into clean and beautiful "homes for the wounded and sick." Pictures were posted on the walls, fresh flowers were placed on the tables, pine trees and vegetable plots were outside the rooms, and various patterns and slogans were laid out on the ground with colored pebbles, so that the wounded and sick soldiers could enjoy a comfortable recuperation environment in the context of war.

　　With the efforts of the medical staff, the nursing and sanitation conditions in various hospitals have been improved day by day. In a certain hospital, various nursing appliances were manufactured from local materials last year, totaling more than 8,400 pieces. In a certain hospital, wounded and sick soldiers could change clothes on average every three days. Even in the severe winter, the female nurses disregarded their frozen hands and feet and broke the ice in the river to wash clothes for the wounded and sick soldiers. Female nurse Bai Wanjin washed a total of more than 200 pieces of clothing in three months.

　　The cooks in various hospitals often solicit opinions from the wounded and sick soldiers and improve their cooking skills. Hou Fushan, a second-class meritorious cook in a certain hospital, used waste materials to make a water suction pipe to directly bring clean spring water to the stove. Cook Lai Xiangyun devised a method to steam soft and hard rice and steamed buns in the same steamer at the same time, so that the wounded and sick soldiers could eat food that suited their tastes. The food management personnel in various hospitals formulate different recipes for the wounded and sick soldiers every week, and often explain nutritional chemistry to the cooks.

　　Medical staff are actively donating blood to the wounded and sick soldiers, and various hospitals have voluntarily formed blood donation teams. In a certain hospital, medical staff donated 52,135 cc of blood to the wounded and sick soldiers in 1952 alone. Dr. Jiang Yongling in a certain hospital donated 800 cc of blood to the wounded and sick soldiers in half a year. In addition, many medical staff members rescued wounded and sick soldiers at the risk of their lives during enemy bombing raids.

　　Medical staff have established great achievements in their selfless work. In 1952, 2,431 meritorious personnel emerged from the Volunteer Army's field hospitals.

    志愿军各野战医院救治伤病员工作有成绩
    大部分伤病员迅速恢复健康重返前线
    【新华社朝鲜前线六日电】中国人民志愿军各野战医院救治伤病员的工作有成绩，使大部分伤病员经过治疗都能迅速恢复健康，重返前线。
    一九五二年全军伤病员治愈率为百分之九十六点六。这是祖国人民大力支援和前线医务工作人员及其他工作人员高度发扬了全心全意为伤病员服务的精神，克服困难，努力工作的结果。
    各野战医院的医务工作人员用自己艰苦的劳动，为伤病员修建了许多阳光充足、空气流通的地下医院，并用自烧的石灰粉刷墙壁和防潮。由女护士金长德发起的“布置模范病室运动”正在各野战医院普遍开展着。某院护士拾废铁自压炉条替各个重伤员修成了一种能加温的单人床。某院工作人员上山割了许多葛藤，给伤病员做成了一百多只像钢丝床一样舒服的软床。各医院女护士们利用点滴空隙时间把病室收拾成为清洁美观的“伤病员之家”，壁上贴着图画，桌上放着鲜花，室外是松树和菜畦，地上还有用有色石子砌成的各种图案和标语，使伤病员们在战争情况下得到了舒适的休养环境。
    在医务工作人员的努力下，各医院日益改善了护理和卫生条件。某院在去年一年中利用当地材料就自造了各种护理用具八千四百余件，某院伤病员平均每三天就可以换一次衣服。就是在严寒的冬天，女护士们也不顾手冻脚冷，敲开河里的冰凌为伤病员洗衣服。女护士白万金在三个月中一共洗了二百多件衣服。
    各医院的炊事员们经常征求伤病员的意见，改进烹调技术。某院二等功臣炊事员侯福山利用废料制成吸水管，把清洁的泉水直接引到灶上来。炊事员赖祥云想了一种方法，可以同时在一个蒸笼里蒸出软硬干饭和馒头等，使伤病员能够吃到合乎自己胃口的饭食。各医院的伙食管理人员，每周都为伤病员制订各种不同的食谱，并常常给炊事员讲解营养化学。
    医务工作人员都踊跃地为伤病员输血，各医院都有自愿组成的输血队。某院医务工作人员在一九五二年一年中就为伤病员输血五万二千一百三十五西西。某院医生蒋永领在半年中就为伤病员输血八百西西。另外，还有许多医务工作人员在敌机轰炸中舍身抢救伤病员。
    医务工作人员在忘我的工作中建立了巨大的功勋。一九五二年志愿军各野战医院中就出现了二千四百三十一位功臣。
