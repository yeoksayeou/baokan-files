Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 8th. Park Chung-ae, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Korean Democratic Women's League, sent a telegram on the 6th to the Presidium of the World Women's Conference, congratulating the opening of the World Women's Conference. The telegram is as follows: Presidium of the World Women's Conference in Copenhagen, Denmark:

    On behalf of the fighting Korean women, I extend a fighting friendship greeting to the World Women's Conference and express my deep gratitude to the delegates of the conference representing peace-loving women all over the world for their support for the Korean people who are fighting for freedom, independence and world peace.
    Korean women and all the Korean people are extremely indignant to learn that the Danish government refused to grant entry visas to the Korean delegates participating in the World Women's Conference. On behalf of all Korean women and all Korean people, I lodge a serious protest against this despicable act by the Danish government authorities.
    Although the seats reserved for the Korean women delegates at the conference are empty, the Korean women delegates are still with you. The Korean women delegates are fully qualified to take that seat, because they have endured long-term colonial oppression in the past, and today they are suffering extreme pain and disaster due to the aggression of US imperialism, and are bravely fighting for peace and the happiness of future generations.
    We, the Korean women, want to combine our powerful voices with your voices, the voices of the friends of Korean women, and the voices of peace-loving women all over the world.
    We sincerely hope that the work of the World Women's Conference will achieve great success.
    Park Chung-ae, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Korean Democratic Women's League

    朴正爱电贺世界妇女大会的召开
    【新华社平壤八日电】朝鲜民主妇女同盟中央委员会委员长朴正爱在六日打电报给世界妇女大会主席团，祝贺世界妇女大会的召开。电文如下：丹麦哥本哈根世界妇女大会主席团：
    我以战斗着的朝鲜妇女的名义，向世界妇女大会致以战斗的友谊祝贺，并向代表着全世界爱好和平妇女的大会代表们表示深深的感谢，感谢她们对于为争取自由、独立和世界和平而斗争的朝鲜人民的声援。
    朝鲜妇女和全朝鲜人民获悉丹麦政府拒绝给参加世界妇女大会的朝鲜代表们以入境签证，极为激愤。我代表全朝鲜妇女和全朝鲜人民对丹麦政府当局这种卑劣行为，提出严重的抗议。
    大会为朝鲜妇女代表们所设的席虽然空了，但是，朝鲜妇女代表们依然是和你们在一起的。朝鲜妇女代表有着取得那个席位的充分资格，因为她们过去经受了长期的殖民地压迫，今天她们因美帝国主义的侵略而遭受着极大的痛苦和灾难，正在为争取和平与后代们的幸福而勇敢地战斗着。
    我们朝鲜妇女要把自己的有力呼声，和朝鲜妇女的朋友——你们的呼声，世界爱好和平妇女的呼声汇合在一起。
    我们衷心地期望世界妇女大会的工作获得巨大的成就。
    朝鲜民主妇女同盟中央委员会委员长朴正爱
