Xinhua News Agency: Moscow, 29th (TASS)—Soviet scientists are striving to create the most favorable conditions for the all-round development of children's physical and intellectual abilities. Approximately twenty institutes and dozens of hygiene departments attached to higher medical education institutions have been established in the Soviet Union to specifically study the protection of children's and young people's health.

	Professor G. Miterev, Director of the Erisman Hygiene Institute, the largest of these institutes, told a TASS reporter: Systematic research into the health and development of children has been conducted for several years in many towns and villages of the Soviet Union. The results of physical examinations of tens of thousands of children prove that the continuous improvement of the Soviet people's living standards and the achievements of Soviet public health in the years after the war have eliminated the effects of the war on children's health. The average indicators of physical development (weight, height, and chest circumference) of school-age and pre-school-age children now exceed pre-war levels. Soviet scientists attach great importance to the problem of school buildings. The tens of thousands of schools built in the Soviet Union in the years after the war were designed in accordance with the latest hygienic requirements in architecture. School children now have spacious, bright, and comfortable classrooms and laboratories. In order to meet the requirements of the implementation of the ten-year universal compulsory education (secondary education) and comprehensive technical education, hygienists are participating in the design of new types of school buildings. They are studying the problem of improving the lighting of school buildings and many other school hygiene issues. For example, scientists are now experimenting with special ultraviolet lamps, which, when combined with ordinary lamps, can compensate for the lack of sunshine in winter and benefit students' health. Because sports and physical education occupy an important place in the Soviet education system, hygienists are also studying the impact of sports activities on children's physical development. Professor Miterev pointed out that these are only a small part of the work of Soviet scientists specializing in the study of children's health problems, and all these research works are based on the solid foundation of the physiological theories of the great Russian scientist Ivan Pavlov.

Xinhua News Agency: Children in the People's Democratic countries of Eastern Europe live a happy material and cultural life under the parental care of the Communist and Workers' Parties and governments of those countries.

	In Hungary, the state spends one billion forints (Hungarian currency) annually for the welfare of mothers and children. Since liberation, Hungary has established many nurseries and kindergartens that can accommodate a total of 100,000 children, as well as many children's hospitals, children's sanatoriums, and children's rest homes. Every summer, the state organizes Young Pioneer camps and travel camps, enabling approximately 200,000 children to spend enjoyable and beneficial holidays on the shores of Lake Balaton, the banks of the Danube, in the Buda Mountains, or in other scenic areas. This year, to celebrate "June 1st" International Children's Day, Hungary is holding a "Children's Week" from May 24th to 31st, under the auspices of the Hungarian Democratic Women's League.

	Romania has established many kindergartens, nurseries, and playgrounds for pre-school children. All school-age children in Romania have the opportunity to study. The number of schools is increasing year by year. This year alone, 109 elementary schools and more than 180 seven-year schools and secondary schools have been established. There are now approximately 2.4 million children studying in schools at all levels. In their spare time, they go to children's reading rooms, parks, and children's palaces. There are now 355 children's palaces nationwide, many of which are built in scenic areas. During the summer vacation, children can participate in cultural activities such as summer camps, summer clubs, and field trips.

	Albania, with a population of just over 1.2 million, now has more than 200 kindergartens. Before World War II, Albania did not have a single kindergarten. Now, towns and villages in Albania have 90 maternity hospitals and 96 maternal and child health stations. In 1951 and 1952 alone, mothers with many children and single mothers received a total of 480 million leks in government subsidies. Albania currently has 2,098 primary schools. All children aged seven and above are in school. People's Albania has established many Young Pioneer palaces, children's libraries, parks, and other cultural institutions for children to enjoy.

	Other People's Democratic countries in Eastern Europe are also creating good conditions for the growth and education of children. In Poland, the number of publications for young people alone exceeded 15 million copies in just a few months this year, which is four times more than the total number of literary books published in Poland in the twenty years before the war. This year in Bulgaria, there are 4,135 summer nurseries and kindergartens to be established in villages alone, which can accommodate 190,000 farm children.

    苏联和人民民主国家
    儿童过着幸福的物质和文化生活
    【新华社讯】据塔斯社莫斯科二十九日讯：苏联科学家努力为儿童的体育和智育的全面发展，创造最有利的条件。现在苏联已经建立了大约二十个研究所和几十个附设在高等医学教育机关中的卫生学讲座，专门研究保护儿童和青年健康的问题。
    这种研究所中最大的一个——叶里斯孟卫生研究所的所长格·米捷列夫教授对塔斯社记者发表谈话说：在苏联的许多城镇和乡村里，已经对儿童的健康和发育情况进行了好几年的有系统的研究。成万儿童体格检查的结果证明，苏联人民生活水平的不断提高和战后几年来苏联公共卫生事业的成就消除了战争对儿童健康的影响。现在，学龄儿童和学龄前儿童身体发育的平均指标（体重、身高和胸围）超过了战前的水平。苏联科学家非常重视学校建筑的问题。苏联在战后几年中建造的几万所学校都是依照卫生学在建筑方面的最新要求而设计的。现在，学校儿童有了宽敞、明亮和舒适的教室和实验室。为了适应实施十年制普及义务教育（中等教育）和综合技术教育的要求，卫生学家们参加新型学校建筑物的设计工作。他们正在研究使学校房屋光线更好的问题和其他许多有关学校卫生的问题。例如，科学家现在正在试验特别的紫外线灯光，这种灯光和普通灯光配合在一起，在冬天可以弥补阳光之不足而有益于学生的身体。由于运动和体育在苏联教育制度中占着重要的地位，卫生学家们也在研究体育运动对于儿童身体发育的影响。米捷列夫教授指出，这些不过是苏联科学家专门研究儿童卫生问题工作中的一小部分，所有这些研究工作都是在伟大俄罗斯科学家伊凡·巴夫洛夫的生理学学说的坚固基础上进行的。
    据新华社讯：东欧人民民主国家的儿童在各该国共产党和工人党及政府父母般的关怀下过着幸福的物质和文化生活。
    在匈牙利，为了母亲和孩子的福利，国家每年都要支出十亿福林（匈币）的款项。自从解放以来，匈牙利已经建立了共可容纳十万个孩子的许多托儿所和幼儿园，以及许多儿童医院、儿童疗养院和儿童休养所。每年夏天国家都组织少年先锋营和旅行营，使大约二十万个儿童能够到巴尔顿湖畔、多瑙河岸、布达马克拉山中或其他名胜地区度过欢快而有益的假期生活。今年匈牙利为庆祝“六一”国际儿童节，正在匈牙利民主妇女联盟主持下，从五月二十四日到三十一日举行“儿童周”。
    罗马尼亚为学龄前的儿童设立了许多幼儿园、托儿所和游戏场。一切学龄儿童在罗马尼亚都有求学的机会。学校年年都在增加。仅在今年就建立了一百零九所初等学校和一百八十多所七年制学校和中等学校。现在在各级学校学习的儿童共约二百四十万人。在课余时间他们就到儿童阅览室、公园和少年宫去。现在全国已有三百五十五个少年宫，其中有许多是建立在风景优美的地区里。在暑假中，儿童们可以参加夏令营、夏季俱乐部和郊外旅行一类的文化活动。
    全国人口不过一百二十万人的阿尔巴尼亚，现在有两百多个幼儿园。而在第二次世界大战以前，阿尔巴尼亚没有一个幼儿园。现在，阿尔巴尼亚各城镇和乡村已有了九十个产妇院和九十六个母婴保健站。仅只在一九五一年和一九五二年两年中，子女众多的母亲和单身母亲就得到政府发给的总数达四亿八千万里克的津贴。阿尔巴尼亚现有小学二千零九十八个。所有年满七岁的儿童都进了学校。人民的阿尔巴尼亚建立了许多少年先锋宫、儿童图书馆、公园和其他文化机关供儿童享用。
    东欧其他人民民主国家也同样地为孩子们的成长和教养创造着良好的条件。在波兰，单是为少年出版的读物，在今年不过几个月的期间，就超过了一千五百万册，比战前波兰二十年出版的全部文学书籍总数要多四倍。今年保加利亚，单是各村庄要设立的夏季托儿所和幼儿园就有四千一百三十五个，可以容纳十九万个农家儿童。
