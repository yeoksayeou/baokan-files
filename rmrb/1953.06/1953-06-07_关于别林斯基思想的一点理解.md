    A Little Understanding of Belinsky's Thought
    Man Tao
    Today is the 105th anniversary of the death of the great Russian revolutionary democrat and literary critic Belinsky.
    When Belinsky's name is mentioned, what is most memorable is his pure steel-like personality, his selfless love for truth, and his passionate dedication to his beliefs; his struggle in the face of attacks from literary hacks and charlatans in Tsarist Russia, his struggle against poverty and tuberculosis germs; and the brilliant intellectual wealth he left to the world during his short but intense fourteen years of literary work. Especially after studying Comrade Malenkov's report at the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks), we should remember with respect and gratitude the brilliant achievements of this intellectual giant, the predecessor of the Russian Social Democrats (Lenin: "What Is To Be Done?"), more than a century ago.
    One of Belinsky's most outstanding achievements is his exposition of the correct theory of literary types in his voluminous works.
    In Chinese literary circles, some people in the past had incorrect understandings of the relationship between political value and artistic value, as if there were an insurmountable gap between the two. This shows the confusion in their thinking on typology. They do not understand the rich ideological significance contained in the type itself, but demand that politics be inserted into the characters like a label, forming a tendency towards formalism and conceptualization in creation.
    We should learn from the classical instructions of the mentor Marx. He pointed out that the shortcoming of Lassalle's works lies in simply turning the characters "into mouthpieces of the spirit of the age."
    Belinsky also repeatedly warned us: "One of the most remarkable signs of creation itself is this typicality..." (Translated Chinese version of "Selected Works of Belinsky," Volume 1, page 241). "Typicality is one of the basic laws of creation; without typicality, there is no creation." (Ibid., Volume 1, page 293)
    Comrade Malenkov's report at the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) possesses incomparably profound ideological content, and what is particularly educational for our literary and art workers is his scientific argument on typology:
    "Typicality is consistent with the essence of certain socio-historical phenomena;... typicality is the basic scope of the expression of party spirit in realistic art. The problem of typicality is at all times a political problem."
    Here it is very clearly pointed out that the party spirit in literature is by no means an illustration of history or sociology, but must be expressed through types. Marxist-Leninist aesthetics never mechanically separates political content and artistic technique, but always understands the dialectical relationship between them in a unified way.
    "Human consciousness, science, reflects the essence, the noumenon of nature." (Lenin: "Philosophical Notebooks") Science itself is a generalization, and a correct generalization not only does not violate the truth, but is closer to the truth, because abstract thinking can reflect objective truth more deeply, faithfully, and comprehensively than intuition. Advocates of art for art's sake promote ethereal beauty, etherealness, psychological distance... These are completely contrary to the Marxist-Leninist aesthetic view. As the founder of materialist aesthetics, Belinsky correctly understood the similarities and differences between science and literature. He said:
    "People see that art and science are not the same thing, but they do not know that the difference between them lies not in the content at all, but in the method used to deal with specific content. The philosopher speaks with syllogisms, and the poet speaks with images and pictures, but they are both talking about the same thing..." (Translated Chinese version of "Selected Works of Belinsky," Volume 2, pages 428-429).
    Therefore, on the one hand, he severely criticized the fallacy of art for art's sake that is divorced from reality, believing that "the idea of imagining art as a pure and exclusive thing that lives in its own special small world and has no common ground with other aspects of life is abstract and illusory. Such art does not exist at any time or place." (Ibid., Volume 2, page 417) At the same time, as Comrade Stalin taught us, he also saw the need to distinguish the different particularities of different social phenomena—art and science. That is to say, the generalization of art is different from the generalization of science; it must be a generalization expressed in personalized, concrete, and sensual forms.
    After Comrade Stalin published the classic work "Marxism and Problems of Linguistics," the Soviet literary and art circles emphasized the issue of the particularity of literature and art. Belinsky's materialist aesthetic view also helps us to understand this issue. He said:
    "No matter how beautiful the thought that fills a poem, no matter how strongly it reflects modern problems, if there is no poetry in it, then it cannot contain beautiful thoughts and any problems. All we can see is, at best, a beautiful attempt that is very badly executed." (Ibid., Volume 2, page 415). He also said:
    "Today, many people are fascinated by the magical word 'tendency'; they think that the crux of the problem lies here, but they do not know that, first of all, in the realm of art, a tendency is not worth a penny if it is not supported by talent; secondly, the tendency itself must not only exist in the mind, but mainly must exist in the heart, in the writer's blood; it must mainly be a feeling, an instinct, and then perhaps a conscious thought--tendency must arise like art itself..." (Translated Chinese version of "Selected Works of Belinsky," Volume 2, page 430).
    Needless to explain, from the words themselves, we can see that Belinsky emphasizes "tendency," but he advocates that the tendency must first be transformed into the author's flesh and blood, and then be expressed naturally and spontaneously through vivid and concrete character images. Because "what comes out of the fountain is all water, and what comes out of the blood vessels is all blood." (Lu Xun's words) Specifically, today, if we want to create socialist realistic literary works, we must first, as Chairman Mao instructed, integrate our "thoughts and feelings with the thoughts and feelings of the workers, peasants, and soldiers." Without this change and transformation of integrated thoughts and feelings, there is no true revolutionary tendency. Separated from concrete reality, one-sidedly emphasizing political content, this content will inevitably be架空(abstracted), and at the same time will inevitably surrender to art for art's sake, admitting so-called "pure beauty." Belinsky pointed out the importance of typicality, believing that this is the fundamental problem of creation, which fundamentally negates the ethereal and elusive beauty of art for art's sake, and affirms the great power of realistic aesthetics. The ideological content in great realistic literature is by no means the dogma of dogmatists, but the actual ideological power that subtly influences people.
    Belinsky was a great realist, and therefore, also a patriotic one with clear love and hate. He said:
    "Patriotism does not lie in grand rhetoric and trite talk, but in ardent love for the motherland, which may not be clamorous, may not only be expressed in cheering for good things, but also in hostility towards bad things."
    The Soviet literary and art circles put forward the slogan "We need Gogol and Shchedrin." We know that Gogol's satire is a manifestation of patriotism that expresses "hostility towards bad things." It is worth noting that Belinsky was the earliest interpreter, supporter, and promoter of Gogol's works.
    How misunderstood, distorted, rejected, and despised Gogol's works were at that time! Some writers who started from subjectivism and attempted to embellish the ugly reality of the time could not tolerate the sharp satire contained in Gogol's works. Goncharov said in an article recalling Belinsky that if it were not for Belinsky, Gogol would probably not be valued as he is today. Belinsky's name cannot be separated from Gogol's. In more than a hundred articles, he fought for Gogol's satirical tradition, passionately defending his beloved beliefs, and how powerfully he attacked his opponents with meticulous and original arguments, and spicy and sharp articles!
    Belinsky has been dead for more than a hundred years, but every one of his readers will still remember the words that Dobrolyubov said when he first published Belinsky's selected works after Belinsky's death:
    "No matter what happens to Russian literature, no matter how vigorously and magnificently it develops, Belinsky will always be its pride, glory, and ornament."
    A century has passed, and we can still feel the power of this sincere evaluation. The people of New China, who have overthrown the dark rule, stand together with the people of the Soviet Union, regarding Belinsky as the great fighting tradition of realistic literature. We can still draw strength from him. When we discuss the issue of types, the issue of satirical literature, etc., we still need to learn from him and gain infinite experience and lessons from him.

    关于别林斯基思想的一点理解
    满涛
    今天是俄国伟大革命民主主义者与文学批评家别林斯基逝世的一百零五周年纪念日。
    提起别林斯基的名字，最使人怀念的是他纯钢般的人格，对于真理的无私的爱和献身于信仰的热烈的战斗；是在帝俄时代文氓和江湖术士们围攻中的奋斗，在贫困和肺痨病菌的侵袭中的挣扎；是他短促而紧张的十四年文学工作，留给全世界的光辉的思想财富。特别在学习了马林科夫同志在苏联共产党（布）第十九次代表大会上的报告之后，我们更要怀着敬意和感激时时刻刻想起一百多年前这位思想巨人，俄国社会民主党的前辈（列宁：“做什么？”）的光辉的战绩。
    别林斯基最卓越的战绩之一，便是他在卷帙浩繁的无数作品中发挥了正确的文学的典型论。
    在中国文艺界，过去曾有人对政治价值与艺术价值的关系有不正确的认识，他们以为二者之间仿佛有一道不可逾越的鸿沟。这件事说明了他们在典型论方面的思想混乱，他们不理解典型本身所包含的丰富的思想意义，却要求把政治像标签似地插到人物身上去，形成创作上的公式主义和概念化的倾向。
    我们应该学习导师马克思的古典指示。他指出拉萨尔的作品的缺点在于单纯地把人物“变为时代精神的传声筒”。
    别林斯基也一再告诫我们：“创作本身的最卓特的征兆之一，就是这典型性……”（“别林斯基选集”中译本第一卷第二四一页）。“典型性是创作的基本法则之一，没有典型性，就没有创作。”（同前书第一卷第二九三页）
    马林科夫同志在苏联共产党（布）第十九次代表大会上的报告，拥有无比深刻的思想内容，而对于我们文艺工作者特别富有教育意义的是他关于典型论的科学的论点：
    “典型性是与一定社会历史现象的本质相一致的；……典型是党性在现实主义艺术中的表现的基本范围。典型问题任何时候都是一个政治性的问题。”
    这里非常清楚地指出，文学中的党性绝对不是什么历史学或社会学的图解，却必须通过典型表现出来。马克思列宁主义的美学，从来不把政治内容和艺术技巧机械地割裂开来，却总是统一地去理解它们之间的辩证的关系。
    “人的意识，科学，反映着本质，自然的本体。”（列宁：“哲学笔记”）科学本身是一种概括，而正确的概括非但不违反真实，反而更接近真实，因为抽象的思惟比直觉更能深刻地、忠实地、全面地反映出客观真实来。艺术至上主义者宣扬着虚无缥渺的美，空灵，心理距离……这些是和马克思列宁主义的美学观完全背道而驰的。作为唯物论美学奠基人的别林斯基，曾经正确地理解了科学和文学的相同点和不同点。他说：
    “人们看到，艺术和科学不是同一件东西，却不知道，它们之间的差别根本不在内容，而在处理特定内容时所用的方法。哲学家用三段论法，诗人则用形象和图画说话，然而他们说的都是同一件事。……”（“别林斯基选集”中译本第二卷第四二八——四二九页）
    因此，他一方面严厉地抨击脱离现实的艺术至上主义的虚谬，认为“把艺术设想成活在自己特殊的小天地里、和生活别的方面毫无共通之点的纯粹的、排他的东西，这种想法是抽象而空幻的。这样的艺术，在任何时候，任何地方，都是不存在的。”（同前书第二卷第四一七页）同时，正像斯大林同志所教导我们的，他也看到了必须分辨不同社会现象——艺术与科学——的不同的特殊性。就是说，艺术的概括与科学的概括不同，它必须是表现在个性化的、具体感性的形式里面的概括。
    在斯大林同志发表了经典著作“马克思主义与语言学问题”以后，苏联的文艺界强调地提出文艺的特殊性问题。别林斯基的唯物论的美学观，也正好帮助我们认识这个问题。他说：
    “不管一首诗充满着怎样美好的思想，不管它多么强烈地反映着现代问题，可是如果里面没有诗歌，那么，它就不能够包含美好的思想和任何问
    题，我们所能看到的，充其量不过是执行得很坏的美好的企图而已。”（同前书第二卷第四一五页）又说：
    “今天，许多人为‘倾向’这个魔法的字所迷
    惑；认为问题的症结便在这儿，却不知道，首
    先，在艺术的畛域上，倾向要不是被才能支持
    着，是不值一文钱的，其次，倾向本身必须不仅
    存在在头脑里，却主要地必须存在在心里，在写
    作人的血液里；它主要地必须是一种感情，一种
    本能，然后恐怕再是一种自觉的思想，——倾向非
    像艺术本身那样地生发出来不可。……”（“别
    林斯基选集”中译本第二卷第四三○页）
    用不着解释，从文字本身就可以知道别林斯基是强调“倾向”的，但是他主张倾向必须先化为作者的血肉，然后通过生动而具体的人物形象自然而然地表现出来。因为“从喷泉里出来的都是水，从血管里出来的都是血。”（鲁迅语）具体地说，今天我们要创作社会主义现实主义的文学作品，首先就必须像毛主席所指示的，把自己的“思想感情和工农兵大众的思想感情打成一片”，没有这个“打成一片”的思想感情的变化和改造，就没有真正的革命的倾向。离开了具体真实，片面地强调政治内容，这内容必然是架空的，同时也就不可避免地会向艺术至上主义缴械投降，承认所谓“纯粹的美”。别林斯基指出典型的重要性，认为这是创作的根本问题，这就从根本上否定了艺术至上主义的虚无缥渺不可捉摸的美，肯定了现实主义美学的伟大力量。伟大的现实主义文学中的思想内容决不是教条主义者的教条，而是使人潜移默化的实际的思想力量。
    别林斯基是个伟大的现实主义者，因此，也是一个爱憎分明的爱国主义者。他说：
    “爱国主义不在于大言壮语和陈腐之谈，而在
    于对祖国的热烈的爱，这爱，可以不是叫嚣，可
    以不仅表露在对美好事物的欢呼里，并且也表露
    在对恶劣事物的敌意里。”
    苏联文艺界提出了“我们需要果戈理和谢德林”的口号。我们知道果戈理的讽刺是“对恶劣事物的敌意”的爱国主义的表露。值得我们注意的是，别林斯基是果戈理作品的最初的诠释者、拥护者、发扬者。
    果戈理的作品在当时曾经被人怎样地误解、歪曲、唾弃、蔑视！从主观主义出发，企图粉饰当时的丑恶现实的一些文学家，怎么也不能容忍果戈理的作品里面所包含的锐利的讽刺。冈察罗夫在一篇回忆别林斯基的文章里说过这样的话：要是没有别林斯基，果戈理恐怕不会像今天似的被人重视。别林斯基的名字和果戈理是不能分开的。他在一百多篇文章中为果戈理的讽刺传统战斗了过来，他热情地辩护着心爱的信念，用绵密而独创的议论，辛辣而尖锐的文章，多么有力地打击了论敌！
    别林斯基逝世一百多年了，可是他的每一个读者仍会记起杜勃罗留波夫在别林斯基去世后第一次出版了他的选集时说过的这句话：
    “不管俄国文学发生些什么事情，不管它发展
    得怎样蓬勃壮盛，别林斯基永远都将是它的矜夸，
    光荣和装饰。”
    时间过去了一世纪，我们仍旧可以感到这个真切的评价的力量。推翻了黑暗统治的新中国人民和苏联人民站在一起，把别林斯基作为现实主义文学的伟大的战斗传统。我们仍旧可以从他那里吸取力量。我们讨论到典型问题，讨论到讽刺文学等等问题时，还需要向他学习，向他取得无穷的经验和教训。（附图片）
