Xinhua News Agency, 19th: According to reports from British and American news agencies, the American side's connivance with the Syngman Rhee gang's forced retention of Korean People's Army prisoners of war (POWs) and destruction of the agreement on the repatriation of POWs has caused worry and dissatisfaction in many countries.

    A British Foreign Office source said on the 18th that Britain "takes a very serious view" of this incident. The British Foreign Office officially announced that it had held "urgent consultations" with the United States on the matter. British officials were "concerned about this sudden action." When Prime Minister Churchill spoke on the matter in the House of Commons on the 18th, "angry and worried members of Parliament" raised "a series of questions" to him. British diplomats believe that "this is a very serious setback for Western diplomacy, and the consequences cannot yet be fully estimated." The British "New Statesman and Nation" magazine commented that this is "an irresponsible, desperate attempt to undermine the armistice negotiations."

    The President of the United Nations General Assembly, Canadian Foreign Minister Pearson, said that this is "a serious development" in the Korean armistice process. United Nations Secretary-General Hammarskjöld issued a statement saying: "This is a regrettable matter," and this "serious development in the situation" is "a clear violation of the United Nations position."

    United Nations personnel are all "worried," and some Western representatives are "surprised that the Allied Command allowed South Korean troops to guard the prisoners of war after spokesmen in South Korea repeatedly stated their opposition to the armistice being negotiated."

    A Swedish official spokesman said that due to the "results and reactions" of Syngman Rhee's destruction of the agreement on the repatriation of POWs, Sweden "will consider its position on the Repatriation Commission."

    India strongly condemned the Syngman Rhee group's action of "releasing" prisoners of war. An authoritative source said: "The New Delhi government is deeply saddened by the recent events in South Korea." The New Delhi "Statesman" commented that since it was known long ago that such an event might occur, "the failure to prevent it seems very incomprehensible." The "Times of India" said: "Allowing fanatics to run rampant in Korea has threatened peace in Asia and the world." The United States "has fundamentally failed to restrain" the Syngman Rhee group.

    French diplomats said on the 18th that French officials were all "anxious" about this incident, "they fear that the results achieved in the armistice negotiations over the past few months may now be destroyed."

    Australian Foreign Minister Richard Casey said on the 19th that Australia "does not approve of actions that endanger the armistice. The release of prisoners of war conflicts with the understandings reached so far."

    A spokesman for the Canadian Foreign Ministry said: "The release of prisoners of war is not a matter for one country to act alone. This matter may cause serious delays in reaching an armistice."

    Mexican Foreign Minister Luis Padilla Nervo said on the 18th: "Mexico is particularly concerned about the issue of prisoners of war." Syngman Rhee's action of "releasing" prisoners of war "may complicate the final resolution of the Korean armistice negotiations."

    美国纵容李承晚强迫扣留战俘
    引起许多国家忧虑和不满
    【新华社十九日讯】据英国的和美国的通讯社报道，美方纵容李承晚匪帮强迫扣留朝鲜人民军被俘人员、破坏关于战俘遣返问题协议，使许多国家感到忧虑和不满。
    英国外交部人士在十八日说：英国对这个事件“采取了很严重的看法”。英国外交部正式宣布已就此事与美国进行“紧急商谈”。英国官员们对这个“突然行动感到忧虑”。当邱吉尔首相十八日在下议院就此事发表谈话时，“愤怒与忧虑的议员们”向他提出了“一连串的质询”。英国外交家们认为，“这对于西方外交是一个很严重的挫折，其后果如何，尚不能充分估计出来。”英国“新政治家与民族”周刊评论说：这是“一种企图破坏停战谈判的不负责任的、孤注一掷的作法”。
    联合国大会主席、加拿大外交部长皮尔逊发表谈话说：这是朝鲜停战过程中的“一个严重的发展”。联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德发表声明说：“这是一件令人感到遗憾的事”，这种“局势的严重发展”是“显然违反联合国立场”的。
    联合国人士都“感到忧虑”，某些西方代表“对于盟国司令部在南朝鲜发言人一再声明反对在商谈中的停战之后，仍然容许南朝鲜军队看守战俘一事感到惊讶。”
    瑞典官方发言人说，由于李承晚破坏关于战俘遣返问题协议的“结果和反应”，瑞典“将考虑在遣返委员会的地位”。
    印度方面猛烈指责李承晚集团“释放”战俘的行动。一位权威人士说：“新德里政府对南朝鲜最近发生的事件深感遗憾。”新德里“政治家报”评论说，既然早就知道可能会发生这样的事件，“因此，不加以制止似乎是非常不可理解的。”“印度时报”说：“听任偏执狂在朝鲜横行，已经威胁到亚洲和世界的和平”。美国对李承晚集团“根本没有加以约束。”
    法国外交人士在十八日说：法国官员对这一事件都“感到焦急”，“他们怕几个月来停战谈判所达成的结果现在可能被破坏”。
    澳大利亚外交部长理查德·凯西在十九日说：澳大利亚“不赞成危及停战的行动。释放战俘是和迄今达成的谅解冲突的。”
    加拿大外交部的发言人说：“释放战俘不是一个国家单独行动的事情。这件事可能在达成停战的问题上引起严重的拖延”。
    墨西哥外交部长路·帕·纳孚在十八日说：“墨西哥对战俘问题特别关心”。李承晚“释放”战俘的行动“可能使朝鲜停战谈判的最后解决复杂化。”
