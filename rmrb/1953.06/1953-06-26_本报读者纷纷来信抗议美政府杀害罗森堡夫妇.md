    Our Readers Write in Protest Against the U.S. Government's Murder of the Rosenbergs
    The U.S. government's brutal murder of the Rosenbergs has aroused great anger among our readers, who have written in to express their protest. The entire staff of the Institute of Mathematics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences wrote: "The U.S. government, disregarding the protests of people around the world, has brazenly murdered the upright and innocent peace fighters Julius and Ethel Rosenberg. In addition to expressing our utmost anger at this shameless crime, we lodge a solemn protest. The U.S. government's murder of the Rosenbergs is entirely a political conspiracy. The Rosenbergs are innocent victims of the U.S. fascist war clique's incitement of the 'anti-Soviet, anti-communist' Cold War. This event also proves the cowardice and stupidity of the U.S. fascist war clique. The Rosenbergs have sacrificed their lives, but their names will forever inspire the American people to fight more bravely for peace, democracy, freedom, and human rights." The Student Union of the Department of Law of Renmin University of China wrote: "The U.S. government's crime of murdering the Rosenbergs has aroused our extreme anger. The Rosenbergs' 'crime' is completely without legal or factual basis and is purely a political conspiracy. The Rosenbergs are innocent. They were killed simply because they loved peace, loved truth, were unwilling to sell their consciences, and were unwilling to serve as tools of U.S. imperialism's 'Cold War'. Their steadfast spirit will never be forgotten by peace-loving people around the world." The entire staff and families of the Railway Research Institute and work zone of the Ministry of Railways wrote: The Rosenbergs were held in prison by the American rulers for nearly three years, and they always maintained a clear conscience, unwilling to exchange truth for even the priceless gift of life. The Rosenbergs' spirit of loving peace and loving truth will forever live in our hearts. The American rulers' crime of murdering the Rosenbergs has once again exposed their ferocious faces. One Rosenberg couple has fallen, but tens of millions of Rosenberg couples will rise up; this act of trampling on human rights by the U.S. government will only arouse the anger of peace-loving people. Reader Zhang Xuefu wrote: The "democracy" and "freedom" that the American ruling clique has always touted are merely the "freedom" and "democracy" for those executioners and warmongers to clamor for war and harm the people; the lives of the peace-loving, truth-loving, and kind-hearted Rosenbergs were thus cut short. The broad masses of the American people will not be deceived and fooled for long, and more Americans will awaken from this event. Wang Shouqun of the Beijing Escort Brigade wrote: At a time when peace-loving people around the world are working to promote world peace and international security, the U.S. government is murdering the Rosenbergs on trumped-up charges of "atomic espionage," which is not only intimidation against the American people but also a provocation to world peace. This shows that the U.S. government lacks sincerity in easing the international situation. The Rosenbergs' heroic actions embody the strong will of people who love peace and love truth; they are immortal!

专栏：读者来信摘要

    本报读者纷纷来信抗议美政府杀害罗森堡夫妇
    美国政府惨杀罗森堡夫妇的暴行，激起了本报读者的巨大愤怒，他们纷纷来信表示抗议。中国科学院数学研究所全体人员来信说：“美国政府不顾全世界人民的抗议，悍然杀害了正直无罪的和平战士罗森堡夫妇。我们对这一无耻的罪行，除表示万分的愤怒外，并提出严正的抗议。美国政府杀害罗森堡夫妇完全是一个政治阴谋。罗森堡夫妇是美国法西斯战争集团煽动‘反苏反共’冷战的无辜牺牲者。这一事件同时证明了美国法西斯战争集团的卑怯和愚蠢。罗森堡夫妇牺牲了，但他俩的名字将永远鼓舞着美国人民更英勇地争取和平、民主、自由和人权。”中国人民大学法律系学生会来信说：“美国政府杀害罗森堡夫妇的罪行，激起了我们极大的愤怒。罗森堡夫妇的‘罪名’是完全没有法律根据和事实根据的，而纯粹是政治阴谋。罗森堡夫妇是无罪的。他们之被杀害，只不过因为他们爱和平、爱真理，不愿出卖自己的良心，不愿充当美帝国主义的‘冷战’工具。他们的坚贞不屈精神，是全世界爱好和平人民永远不能忘记的。”中央铁道部铁道研究所及工区全体职工、家属来信说：罗森堡夫妇被美国统治者关在监牢里将近三年，他俩始终保持着良心清白，他们不愿以舍弃真理来换取即使是无价之宝的生命。罗森堡夫妇热爱和平、热爱真理的精神将永远活在我们的心里。美国统治者杀害罗森堡夫妇的罪行又
    一次地暴露了他们的狰狞面目。一对罗森堡夫妇倒下去了，千万对罗森堡夫妇将站起来；美国政府这种蹂躏人权的暴行只有激起爱好和平人民的愤怒罢了。读者张学富来信说：美国统治集团向来自吹自擂的“民主”、“自由”，只是那些刽子手和战争贩子们叫嚣战争、残害人民的“自由”、“民主”；爱好和平、爱好真理的、善良的罗森堡夫妇的生命就是这样被断送的。美国广大人民是不会长期被欺骗和愚弄的，更多的美国人民将从这一事件中觉醒过来。北京护车大队王守群来信说：当着全世界爱好和平的人民正为促进世界和平与国际安全而努力的时候，美国政府却以捏造的“原子间谍”的罪名来杀害罗森堡夫妇，这不仅是对美国人民的威吓，而且是对世界和平的挑衅。这表明美国政府对于缓和国际局势是缺乏诚意的。罗森堡夫妇的英雄行为体现了热爱和平、热爱真理的人民的坚强意志，他俩是永垂不朽的！
