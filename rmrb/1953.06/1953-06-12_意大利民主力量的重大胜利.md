A Major Victory for Democratic Forces in Italy
    The second Italian general election after the war was held on June 7th. In this election, the democratic forces in Italy achieved a significant victory. The Italian Communist Party and the Socialist Party gained more votes and seats in both the upper and lower houses than in the 1948 general election. The results of this election once again demonstrate the increasing prestige of the Italian Communist Party and the Socialist Party among the people. Their policies of peace and democracy are receiving increasingly widespread support from the Italian people.

    The major victory achieved by the Italian democratic forces in this election is primarily manifested in its breaking of Gasperi's Christian Democratic Party and its allies' plan to obtain a majority of votes in the lower house election, and thwarting their conspiracy to steal an extra ninety seats by using deceptive election laws. For the five years that the Christian Democratic Party has been in power, it has pursued policies that violate the national interests of Italy, turning Italy into a colony and an base for aggression for the United States, and facing an abyss of economic collapse, and has therefore been opposed by the broad masses of the people. In the local elections held in 1951, the Christian Democratic Party lost more than four million votes. In order to avoid defeat in this general election, the Gasperi group forced the parliament to pass the so-called election system "reform" bill on the eve of the election, attempting to maintain its absolute majority in the parliament and maintain its increasingly shaky rule. According to this absurd election law, a party or party group that obtains more than 50% plus one vote in the election can get 65% of the seats in the lower house. This anti-democratic measure aroused strong indignation among the Italian people. For several months, people from all walks of life in Italy launched a massive protest movement, resolutely opposing this so-called election system "reform" bill. However, the Gasperi group ignored the opposition of the people and went its own way, and wooed other reactionary parties such as the Social Democratic Party, the Liberal Party, and the Republican Party to form an electoral alliance, vainly attempting to steal the majority of seats in the parliament. But in this election for the lower house, the Gasperi group's wishful thinking fell through, and it only got 49.8% of all the votes.

    People only need to pay attention to the undemocratic and unfree nature of this Italian election to know how significant the victory of the Italian democratic forces is. A large number of facts show that this election was conducted in an atmosphere of deception and intimidation. The Gasperi group not only exhausted all kinds of despicable means such as violence, fraud, and religious intimidation in the election, but also the United States openly came forward to interfere in an attempt to influence the outcome of the election. On the eve of the election, the US Ambassador to Italy, Clare Boothe Luce, openly threatened that if the left-wing forces won in this election, "the United States would stop its aid to it (Italy)." But these tricks were not able to save the defeat of the Christian Democratic Party. This shows that the degree of political awareness of the Italian people has greatly improved in the past five years, and more and more voters have seen the true face of the Gasperi group and resolutely cast their votes for the Italian Communist Party and the Socialist Party, which have always advocated peace and democracy.

    Because the Italian Communist Party and the Socialist Party have won more than one-third of the seats in the lower house, it is impossible for the Christian Democratic Party and other reactionary parties to form an absolute majority no matter what, and the various right-wing parties have many contradictions on many issues, and it is not easy to guarantee a weak majority. This cannot but make the United States and the Italian reactionaries encounter greater obstacles in promoting their war policies. Washington has expressed anxiety about this. The Associated Press pessimistically stated: The rise of Italian democracy "today undermined Gasperi's hopes, who had hoped to produce a pro-Western parliamentary majority that could approve the 'European Army' plan and maintain Italy's close alliance with the West." Now it seems that Gasperi's guarantee to US Secretary of State Dulles a few months ago about persuading the Italian parliament to approve the "European Army" treaty is even more difficult to achieve. The Italian Communist Party and the Socialist Party, which have won the support of the vast number of voters, will more forcefully oppose all conspiracies of the Gasperi group to push Italy towards war and fascism; they will further lead the Italian people to win greater victories in the struggle to defend world peace and fight for democracy and freedom.

### 意大利民主力量的重大胜利

    意大利民主力量的重大胜利
    意大利战后第二次大选已于六月七日举行。在这次选举中，意大利的民主力量获得了很大的胜利。意大利共产党和社会党在上下两院的选举中都得到了比一九四八年大选时更多的选票和席位。这次选举的结果，再一次说明了意大利共产党和社会党在人民中的威信日益增强。它们的和平民主政策，受到了意大利人民愈来愈广泛的拥护。
    意大利民主力量在这次选举中所获得的重大胜利，首先表现在它打破了加斯贝利的天主教民主党及其同盟者在下院的选举中求取过半数选票的计划，而挫败了它们企图利用骗人的选举法以窃取额外九十个议席的阴谋。天主教民主党执政五年以来，推行着违反意大利民族利益的政策，使意大利变成美国的殖民地和侵略基地，面临着经济崩溃的深渊，因而受到广大人民的反对。在一九五一年举行的地方选举中，天主教民主党就失去了四百多万张选票。加斯贝利集团为了要避免在这次大选中的失败，在选举前夕强使议会通过了所谓选举制“改革”法案，企图借此保持它在议会中的绝对多数，以维持其日益动摇的统治。根据这个荒谬的选举法，在选举中获得比百分之五十多一张选票的政党或政党集团，便可以得到下院中百分之六十五的议席。这种反民主的措施，曾激起意大利人民强烈的愤怒，几个月来意大利各阶层人民展开了声势浩大的抗议运动，坚决反对这个所谓选举制“改革”法案。但是，加斯贝利集团不顾人民的反对，一意孤行，并拉拢社会民主党、自由党、共和党等其他反动党派，结成选举联盟，妄想窃取议会中的大多数席位。可是在这次下院的选举中，加斯贝利集团的如意算盘落了空，只得了全部选票的百分之四十九点八。
    人们只要注意到这次意大利选举的不民主和不自由的性质，就知道意大利民主力量的胜利具有多么重大的意义。大量的事实说明，这次选举是在欺骗和恐吓的气氛下进行的。加斯贝利集团不仅在选举中用尽了暴力、舞弊、宗教恫吓等卑鄙手段，而且由美国公开出面干涉，以图影响选举的结果。美国驻意大利大使莱尔·布恩·卢斯在选举前夕公然威胁说，如果在这次选举中让左翼势力获得胜利，“美国就要停止对它（意大利）的援助”。但是这些伎俩，也没有能够挽救天主教民主党的失败。这说明意大利人民五年来的政治觉悟程度已大大地提高了，愈来愈多的选民已看清了加斯贝利集团的真面目，而坚决地把选票投给一贯主张和平民主的意大利共产党和社会党。
    由于意大利共产党和社会党在下院中获得了超过三分之一的议席，天主教民主党和其他反动党派无论如何也不可能凑成绝对的多数，而且各右翼党派在许多问题上矛盾重重，要保证一个微弱的多数也不容易，这就不能不使美国及意大利反动派推行其战争政策时将遭遇到更大的障碍。华盛顿方面已对此表示焦虑了，美联社悲观地表示：意大利民主“力量的高涨今天破坏了加斯贝利的希望，加斯贝利曾希望产生一个亲西方的议会多数，能够批准‘欧洲军’计划，并保持意大利和西方的紧密联盟”。现在看来，加斯贝利在几个月前向美国国务卿杜勒斯所作的关于促使意大利议会批准“欧洲军”条约的保证，是更难实现了。获得了广大选民支持的意大利共产党和社会党，必将更有力地反对加斯贝利集团把意大利推向战争和法西斯化道路的一切阴谋；他们必将进一步领导意大利人民，在为保卫世界和平和争取民主自由而进行的斗争中赢得更大的胜利。
