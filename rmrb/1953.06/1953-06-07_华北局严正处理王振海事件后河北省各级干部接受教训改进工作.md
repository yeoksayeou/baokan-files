After the North China Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China seriously handled the case of the anti-Party element Wang Zhenhai, the Ding County Party Committee, after partial reorganization, immediately convened a Party representative meeting, made a resolution to learn from the lessons and improve leadership. At the same time, the Hebei Provincial Party Committee of the Communist Party of China also organized party organizations at all levels to lead all party members and cadres to study the decision of the Discipline Inspection Committee of the North China Bureau on Wang Zhenhai's criminal case and the editorial of this newspaper, to further carry out the struggle against bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of law and discipline.

From studying the decision on handling the Wang Zhenhai incident, all cadres deeply felt that the lessons were serious and profound, believing that if a Communist Party member harbors selfishness and does not thoroughly eliminate it, he will not only fail to serve the people wholeheartedly, but will also develop into a criminal path of being an enemy of the people. Comrade Gao Jian, Secretary of the Raoyang County Party Committee, said: "Selfishness and power together become privilege thinking. If people with this kind of thinking are not cleared up in time, they will do big bad things in the long run." Many people, in the course of study, related and examined their own erroneous thoughts of individualism and liberalism, and were alerted to the fact that bad work styles of liberalism exist in many party and government organizations and among many party members and cadres to varying degrees. For example, the erroneous arguments of "better to do less than more" and "self-criticism is okay, mutual criticism is unnecessary", as well as the vulgar work styles of "not saying things to people's faces, gossiping behind their backs" and "not distinguishing right from wrong, echoing others" were once taken for granted; now, they have been severely criticized. At the Party representative meeting convened by the Ding County Party Committee, many representatives said: "In the past, we felt that committing a little liberalism was nothing, but from the Wang Zhenhai incident, we truly saw that liberalism is something that harms people and the Party." Many comrades from the directly subordinate organizations of Ding County Special District said: "Liberalism is an objective assistant and friend of lawbreakers and criminals." Everyone unanimously believes that we must work together from top to bottom, hold high the weapon of criticism and self-criticism, develop intra-Party democracy, and carry out continuous struggle. We must strengthen learning, including leading cadres at all levels, and must improve our ideological awareness and political analysis ability in order to avoid or reduce mistakes. For example, many cadres in Xinle County said: "Without learning, we often cannot see right and wrong when things happen, so we cannot adhere to principled struggle, which is very dangerous."

Some non-Party cadres and new cadres found the strength to fight against bad people and bad deeds from the Party's serious and correct handling of this incident. They realized that "right and wrong must be clearly distinguished, principles must be adhered to," that truth will eventually prevail, and that bad people will eventually be punished. Mr. Lin Mengsong, Deputy County Head of Ding County, said: "The Communist Party is truly as pure as white jade, selfless and impartial. I will follow the Communist Party for the rest of my life." Many comrades who have newly joined the Ding County Special District Grain Bureau said: "Under the sunshine of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, truth and justice will surely prevail."

The exposure and handling of the Wang Zhenhai incident seriously taught party organizations at all levels and all cadres that they must care about the sufferings of the masses with full enthusiasm, listen to the voices and demands of the masses, so as to closely unite the people around the Party and strive and advance for the people's construction cause. The Hebei Provincial Party Committee of the Communist Party of China is carrying out this anti-bureaucracy struggle, which has great significance for strengthening the Party's ideological and organizational construction, from a broad perspective and starting with "small things." Since January, party and government leading organs at the county level and above have taken effective measures to enrich and strengthen the institutions and work for handling people's letters and receiving people's visits. In the past three months, according to incomplete statistics from six special districts and four cities, a total of 29,401 letters from the masses were received, and 21,287 were handled in the same period. The matters exposed and suggested in the letters from the masses have given great help to the improvement of the work and work style of leading organs at all levels. Since the Provincial Party Committee personally handled the Taidi Village incident, by the end of March, 177 typical cases had been handled in a big way throughout the province. The masses have reflected: "This is truly the people's world!" Secondly, the anti-bureaucracy struggle in Hebei Province is closely combined with the current work and is carried out to promote the current production work. Therefore, provincial-level party and government organs and people's organizations, under the unified leadership of the Party Committee, have planned to go deep into the lower levels, deep into the masses, inspect work, and explain policies. Since March, responsible comrades of provincial-level departments have led cadres to the countryside to inspect the anti-bureaucracy struggle and spring plowing and sowing work. A total of 2,095 cadres from provincial-level departments went to the countryside and factories to inspect and help with the work (including 48 responsible cadres such as ministers and department heads). This planned inspection work has enabled the leading organs to greatly improve their leadership methods in understanding the situation at the lower levels, understanding cadres, and understanding the demands of the masses.

### 华北局严正处理王振海事件后河北省各级干部接受教训改进工作

    华北局严正处理王振海事件后河北省各级干部接受教训改进工作
    自中共中央华北局严正处理反党分子王振海事件后，中共定县地委经过部分改组立即召开了党的代表会议，作出了接受教训改进领导的决议，同时，中共河北省委也组织各级党组织领导全体党员干部学习华北局纪律检查委员会对王振海犯罪事件的决定和本报社论，以进一步开展反官僚主义、反命令主义、反违法乱纪的斗争。
    从学习关于处理王振海事件的决定中，所有干部均深感教训是严重的、深刻的，认为一个共产党员如果怀抱私心，而不痛加剔除，不仅不能全心全意为人民服务，而且发展下去就会走向与人民为敌的犯罪道路。饶阳县委书记高健同志说：“私心和职权碰在一起，就变成特权思想，有这种思想的人如不及时清算，长久下去，就会干出大的坏事来。”很多人在学习中联系检查了自己的个人主义、自由主义的错误思想，警觉到自由主义的坏作风在许多党、政组织中，在不少党员干部中，都或轻或重地存在着。比如对于“多一事不如少一事”、“自我批评可以，互相批评不必”等错误论调，以及“当面不说、背后乱讲”、“不辨是非、随声附和”等庸俗作风，在过去习以为常；现在，均遭到严厉的批判。在定县地委所召开的党代表会议上，很多代表说：“过去感到犯点自由主义不算什么，从王振海事件中，才真正看到了自由主义是害人害党的东西。”定县专区直属机关很多同志说：“自由主义是违法犯罪分子在客观上的助手和朋友。”大家一致认为必须上下一致努力，高举批评与自我批评的武器，开展党内民主，进行持续不断的斗争。必须加强学习，包括各级领导干部在内，必须提高思想觉悟，提高政治分析能力，才能不犯或少犯错误。如新乐县很多干部说：“不学习，遇事常常看不出是非曲直，就无法坚持原则斗争，这是很危险的。”
    若干非党干部和新干部从党对这个事件严肃、正确的处理中，找到了向坏人坏事进行斗争的力量，他们认识到“是非必须明辨，原则必须坚持”，真理终会胜利，坏人终会受到惩处。定县副县长林梦松先生说：“共产党真是洁如白玉，大公无私，我将终生随共产党前进。”定县专区粮食局很多新参加工作的同志说：“在共产党、毛主席阳光照耀下，真理和正义一定会胜利。”
    王振海事件的揭发和处理，严肃地教训了各级党组织和全体干部必须以满腔热忱去关心群众疾苦，去倾听群众呼声和要求，以便把人民群众紧紧团结在党的周围，为人民的建设事业而奋斗，而前进。中共河北省委对于这个加强党的思想和组织建设的有伟大意义的反官僚主义斗争，是从大处着眼，“小处”着手而进行的。自一月份以来，县以上各级党、政领导机关均采取了有效措施，充实和加强了处理人民来信、接见人民来访的机构和工作。三个月来，根据六个专区、四个市不完全的统计，共收到群众来信两万九千四百零一件，同时期即处理了二万一千二百八十七件。群众来信中所揭发和所建议的事项，给予各级领导机关的工作和作风的改进以巨大的帮助。从省委亲自处理台底村事件后，截止三月底，全省已大张旗鼓地处理了典型案件一百七十七件。群众纷纷反映：“这才是人民的天下！”其次，河北省的反官僚主义斗争是紧密结合当前工作并为着推进当前生产工作而进行的。因而，省级党政机关、人民团体，均在党委的统一领导下，有计划地深入下层、深入群众、检查工作、交代政策。自三月以来，省级各部门负责同志，先后率领干部下乡检查反官僚主义斗争和春耕播种工作。总计省级各部门下乡、下厂检查和帮助工作的干部达二千零九十五人（其中包括部长、厅长等负责干部四十八人）。这种有计划的检查工作，使领导机关在了解下情、了解干部、了解群众的要求，改进领导方法收到很大效果。
