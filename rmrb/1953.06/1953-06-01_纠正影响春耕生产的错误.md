    Correcting Errors Affecting Spring Ploughing Production

    The "Reader's Letters Summary" column published on April 27th two letters criticizing the leadership organs of Tonglu County, Zhejiang Province, for issuing too many forms, and the CCP Zunyi City Committee of Guizhou Province, etc., for holding training classes during the busy farming season, thereby affecting farmers' production. Now, we publish below a letter from reader Zhou Shiliang reporting that the Tonglu County Committee and County People's Government accepted the criticism and improved their work, as well as a summary of the reply from the Zunyi City Committee:

    Reader Zhou Shiliang's letter: After I criticized the situation in Tonglu County, Zhejiang Province, where leadership organs at the county and district levels issued too many forms, affecting farmers' production, the County Committee and County People's Government conducted a review of this matter. They held a meeting on April 29th to discuss and resolve to correct the erroneous practice of decentralism and conscientiously implement the principle of making spring ploughing production the central task overriding all others. Zhang Yusan, Secretary of the Jiuling District Committee, also reviewed the error of indiscriminately issuing forms at a general meeting of district and township cadres, guaranteeing to correct it in the future. When arranging work for May, County Head Wang Xinzhi again pointed out to cadres of all departments that they must grasp the central task and prevent decentralism; and he put forward some specific measures to correct the phenomenon of "each going its own way" among the various departments of the County People's Government.

    Letter from the CCP Zunyi City Committee of Guizhou: We are now informing you of the situation and our self-criticism regarding running training classes during the busy farming season. The Provincial Committee notified us to start running training classes for small township cadres and mutual aid team leaders in early March, with each session lasting half a month, divided into two or three sessions. On March 24th, the Municipal Committee conducted a study and, because spring ploughing was approaching, decided to conduct training in two sessions: the first session starting on April 5th, and the second session postponed until late June. After the first session of training began, on April 9th we received instructions from the District Committee: "Shorten the duration of training classes that have already started, and suspend those that have not yet started." Therefore, the training class was concluded five days early on April 15th. We improperly arranged the work, postponing the training class, which should have started in early March, to early April, thereby affecting spring ploughing; this should be corrected in the future.

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    纠正影响春耕生产的错误
    “读者来信摘要”栏在四月二十七日发表了读者批评浙江桐庐县县区领导机关发下表格太多以及中共贵州省遵义市委等在农忙时举办训练班，以致影响农民生产的两封来信。现在将读者周世良报告桐庐县委和县人民政府接受批评、改进工作的来信以及遵义市委的答复信摘要发表于后：
    读者周世良来信：我批评了浙江省桐庐县县区领导机关发下表格太多影响农民生产的情况后，县委和县人民政府就对此作了检查，并在四月二十九日开会讨论，决心纠正分散主义的错误做法，认真贯彻以春耕生产为压倒一切的中心工作的方针。九岭区区委书记张玉三也在全区区乡干部大会上检查了滥发表格的错误，保证今后纠正。县长王新之在布置五月份工作时又向各部门干部指出必须掌握中心工作，防止分散主义；并对纠正县人民政府各部门
    “各自为政”现象提出了一些具体办法。
    中共贵州遵义市委来信：现将我们在农忙时办训练班的情况和检讨告诉你们。省委通知在三月初开始举办小乡干部和互助组长训练班，每半月一期，分二期或三期训练。三月二十四日市委进行研究，因春耕已近，决定分两期训练：第一期在四月五日开始，第二期延至六月下旬举办。第一期训练开始后，四月九日我们接到地委指示：“训练班已办者时间缩短，未办者停办。”因此，训练班就提早五天在四月十五日结束。我们对工作安排不当，把应该在三月初开办的训练班推迟到四月初办，以致影响春耕；今后应该纠正。
