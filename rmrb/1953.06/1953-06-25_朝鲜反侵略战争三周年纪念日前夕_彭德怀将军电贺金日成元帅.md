Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, June 24th: General Peng Dehuai, Commander of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, sent a telegram to Marshal Kim Il-sung, Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army, on the eve of the third anniversary of the Korean War of Resistance Against Aggression. The original telegram is as follows: To Marshal Kim Il-sung, Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army:

    On the occasion of the third anniversary of the Korean people's struggle against American aggression, I and all the commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army extend our warm congratulations to you and the people and army under your leadership for the great victories achieved by the Korean people under your leadership, and extend our fighting salute and cordial greetings to the heroic Korean people and the People's Army.

    The Chinese People's Volunteer Army deeply feels that it is a supreme honor to be with the heroic Korean people, resisting the common enemy of the Chinese and Korean people, and defending the cause of peace in Asia and the world. The unbreakable fighting friendship forged by the blood of the Chinese and Korean people has been increasingly consolidated. Relying on this close fighting friendship and the just support of peace-loving people all over the world, the Korean and Chinese people have severely frustrated the aggression of American imperialism. We have made the greatest efforts to achieve a glorious armistice in Korea and have achieved important results. Although Syngman Rhee, with the connivance of the American government, is still frantically undermining the already reached agreement on the repatriation of prisoners of war, attempting to obstruct the armistice, any of their shameless conspiracies will, as in the past, be completely defeated!
         Commander Peng Dehuai of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army
                June 24, 1953

    朝鲜反侵略战争三周年纪念日前夕
    彭德怀将军电贺金日成元帅
    【新华社朝鲜前线二十四日电】中国人民志愿军司令员彭德怀将军在朝鲜反侵略战争三周年纪念日前夕致电朝鲜人民军最高司令官金日成元帅。原电如下：朝鲜人民军最高司令官金日成元帅：
    在朝鲜人民奋起反抗美国侵略三周年之际，我和中国人民志愿军全体指战员对于朝鲜人民在你的领导下所取得的伟大的胜利，向你和你所领导的人民与军队致以热烈的祝贺，并向英雄的朝鲜人民和人民军致以战斗的敬礼和亲切的慰问。
    中国人民志愿军深感与英雄的朝鲜人民在一起，抵抗朝中人民共同的敌人，捍卫亚洲及世界和平事业是无上的光荣。中国人民与朝鲜人民以鲜血凝结成的牢不可破的战斗友谊已日益巩固，朝鲜人民和中国人民依靠这种亲密的战斗友谊及全世界爱好和平人民的正义支援，已经严重地挫败了美国帝国主义的侵略。我们为了实现朝鲜的光荣停战曾经做了最大的努力，并取得了重要的成就。虽然李承晚仍然在美国政府的纵容下猖狂地破坏已经达成的遣返战俘的协议，企图阻挠停战，但是他们任何无耻的阴谋，终将与过去一样遭到彻底的失败！
         中国人民志愿军司令员彭德怀
                一九五三年六月二十四日
