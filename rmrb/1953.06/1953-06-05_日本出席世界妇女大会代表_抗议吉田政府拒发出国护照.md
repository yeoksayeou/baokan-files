Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 4th - Japanese women are enthusiastically requesting to participate in the World Women's Conference scheduled to be held in Denmark from the 5th to the 12th. They are fighting against the unreasonable measure of the Yoshida government refusing to issue passports to their representatives to travel abroad.
    After the Women's International Democratic Federation issued an invitation to Japanese women to participate in the World Women's Conference, it was immediately met with enthusiastic response from the broad masses of Japanese women. Living under the oppression and exploitation of the American and Japanese reactionaries, and under the heavy burden of military expansion and war preparation, Japanese women have requested to send their representatives to this unprecedentedly broad international women's conference to report on the situation of Japanese women and children to the conference, and to gather together with women representatives from all over the world to discuss the issue of safeguarding the vital interests of women. They established the Preparatory Committee for Japanese Women to Attend the World Women's Conference, and nominated ten women with broad representation, including Councilor Motoko Takada, Secretary-General of the Japan Women's Organizations Federation Ito Hamada, Vice President of the Japan Association for the Protection of Children Setsuko Hani, and the author of "Atomic Bomb Pictures" Toshiko Akamatsu, as representatives to attend the World Women's Conference.
    However, the Yoshida government, fearing that Japanese women would unite with the vast number of women around the world to safeguard the vital interests of women and peace, actually refused to issue passports to Japanese women representatives to travel abroad. This unreasonable decision of the Yoshida government has aroused great anger among Japanese women. The ten representatives, including Motoko Takada, went to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Yoshida government on the 3rd to protest, and demanded that the Yoshida government change its unreasonable decision and allow them to attend the World Women's Conference.

    日本出席世界妇女大会代表
    抗议吉田政府拒发出国护照
    【新华社四日讯】东京消息：日本妇女热烈要求参加定于五日到十二日在丹麦举行的世界妇女大会。她们正在和吉田政府拒绝发给她们的代表以出国护照的无理措施进行斗争。
    国际民主妇女联合会向日本妇女发出参加世界妇女大会的邀请后，立即受到广大日本妇女的热烈响应。生活在美、日反动派的压迫、剥削和扩军备战的重压下的日本妇女，纷纷要求派遣自己的代表出席这一空前广泛的国际性妇女大会，向大会报告日本妇女儿童的状况，并和世界各国的妇女代表共聚一堂商讨保卫妇女切身利益的问题。她们成立了日本妇女出席世界妇女大会的筹备会，并推举了参议员高田愿子、日本妇女团体联合会事务局长滨田糸卫、日本保卫儿童会副会长羽仁说子、“原子弹之画”的作者赤松俊子等十位有广泛代表性的妇女为出席世界妇女大会代表。
    但是吉田政府害怕日本妇女和全世界广大的妇女团结起来保卫妇女切身利益与和平，竟拒绝发给日本妇女代表出国护照。吉田政府这一无理的决定已激起日本妇女的巨大愤怒。高田愿子等十位代表在三日到吉田政府外务省提出抗议，据理要求吉田政府改变无理决定，让她们出席世界妇女大会。
