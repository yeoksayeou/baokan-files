Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, June 20th: To celebrate the convening of the World Peace Council meeting in Budapest and to pay respects to the delegates attending, Budapest residents, under the auspices of the Hungarian National Peace Council, held a grand rally in Kossuth Square on the 19th.

Tens of thousands of Budapest residents flocked to Kossuth Square from all directions to attend the rally. They formed countless orderly rows, waving Hungarian flags and blue banners embroidered with peace doves. They paid tribute to the distinguished peace fighters on the rostrum—Nikolai Tikhonov, Guo Moruo, D'Arboussier, Ikuo Oyama, and others—and shouts of "Long live peace" and "Fight for peace" resounded throughout the square.

At 5 p.m., the rally officially began amidst the solemn strains of the Hungarian national anthem. First, Andics, Chairman of the Hungarian National Peace Council, delivered a speech, followed by World Peace Council Secretary-General Jean Lafitte, who spoke on behalf of the World Peace Council. His speech was warmly welcomed by the masses. The Soviet representative, the famous poet Alexei Surkov, addressed the rally. The masses expressed their boundless gratitude and love for the Soviet people with the simple and powerful slogan "Long live the Soviet Union." Surkov's speech was repeatedly interrupted by thunderous applause. When the Chinese representative Li Dequan addressed the rally, the entire audience unanimously chanted "Mao Zedong—Mao Zedong." Li Dequan first extended greetings on behalf of the Chinese people to the Hungarian people and the Hungarian people's leader, Mátyás Rákosi. Li Dequan said: The Korean armistice negotiations may soon reach an agreement, which is the result of the firm efforts and heroic struggle of the Chinese and Korean people, as well as the promotion of the peace will of the people of the world. Some people keen on war are still carrying out various destructive conspiracies, but we firmly believe that with the united strength of the people and the pressure of world public opinion, consultation will ultimately prevail over force. At the end of Li Dequan's speech, the masses responded with warm and prolonged applause. The speeches of the Korean representative Han Xueye, the African peace fighter D'Arboussier, the British representative Mrs. Felton, and others were all warmly welcomed by the masses.

The rally concluded in the majestic singing of "Peace is Invincible."
