    Earnestly Rectify Original Record Work
    The work of discussing production plans in most factories and mines across the country has come to an end. In order to consolidate the achievements of this plan discussion, some factories and mines have now entered the stage of establishing and strengthening planned management.
    The main content of planned management includes original records, quota management, work plans, and scheduling systems. The work plan is a concentrated expression of planned management, scheduling work is the specific guarantee for the implementation of the work plan, and the original record is the main basis for quota management and the work plan. Whether the original record is correct directly affects the formulation and implementation of the work plan. If quotas are set and work plans are prepared based on unreliable original records, it will not only fail to correctly guide the production of the enterprise but also increase the chaos of the enterprise. Therefore, correct original records are the main basis for enterprise leaders to discover new creations of the masses and problems in production in a timely manner.
    Incomplete or inaccurate original records are of no use. The converter team of the steelmaking workshop of Tangshan Steel Plant once smelted thirteen furnaces of steel in one shift, creating a new record of an average smelting time of thirty-seven minutes per furnace (the quota is forty-six minutes). However, because the operation record was incomplete, it was impossible to summarize and promote these experiences. Conversely, the establishment of a sound original record system has played a significant role in improving enterprise management. After Tangshan Steel Plant established the operation record of the rolling mill, it frequently provided information on the operation, reducing downtime by one-half. In 1952, Benxi Beneficiation Plant discovered through original records that the work performance of one shift was particularly good, so it summarized and promoted the advanced experience of this shift, and the grade of concentrate reached the standard.
    At present, the leading cadres of many factories and mines have not fully recognized the importance of original records. Most leading cadres of Benxi Coal and Iron Company regard the rectification of original records as a simple matter, and they neither participate nor organize relevant cadres from various departments to participate, but only push this important work to the planning department. A few leading cadres, because they do not pay attention to the original record work, also frequently transfer the original record staff. This incorrect view and practice directly affect the attention of record staff and workers to this work. A recorder in the coal mine repair shop of the company said: "It doesn't matter whether there are original records or not, anyway, they are useless." In this work of strengthening planned management, some units did not mention original records at all, and some units only planned to spend a few days sorting out the original records. These are all concrete manifestations of a lack of correct understanding of the importance of original record work.
    At present, there is a common shortcoming in the original records of various factories and mines, that is, the items are not complete, the records are not accurate, there is a lack of a unified management system, there is a lack of overall planning for various records and statistical reports, and there is a lack of unified calculation methods. Some are mutually repetitive, and some are incomplete. Daily reports do not match monthly reports, workshop figures do not match figures from planning, accounting, and other departments, and they are often contradictory. More seriously, individual units have the phenomenon of falsely reporting achievements and falsely listing figures. This certainly cannot play the role of reflecting production conditions in a timely, comprehensive, and correct manner and guiding production.
    In strengthening planned management, all factories and mines must correct the understanding of original records among all employees, address the existing shortcomings, and conduct a thorough rectification of original record work based on the needs of planned management, so as to make the original figures truly become a concrete record of production activities and an important basis for improving the level of enterprise management.

### 认真整顿原始记录工作

    认真整顿原始记录工作
    全国大部厂矿讨论生产计划的工作已告一段落。为着巩固这次讨论计划的成果，目前部分厂矿已进入建立和加强计划管理的阶段。
    计划管理的主要内容包括原始记录、定额管理、作业计划和调度制度。作业计划是计划管理的集中表现，调度工作是实现作业计划的具体保证，而原始记录则是定额管理和作业计划的主要依据。原始记录是否正确，直接影响作业计划的编制和执行。如果根据不可靠的原始记录制订定额和编制作业计划，不但不能正确指导企业的生产，而且会增加企业的混乱。因此，正确的原始记录，是企业领导干部能否及时发现群众的新创造和生产中的问题的主要依据。
    不完全或不准确的原始记录是没有作用的。唐山钢厂炼钢车间转炉组有一次在一班时间内炼了十三炉钢，创造了平均每炉冶炼时间三十七分
    （定额是四十六分）的新记录。但由于操作记录不完全，就无法总结和推广这些经验。与此相反，如果建立了健全的原始记录制度，对于改进企业管理发挥了很大的作用。唐山钢厂建立了轧钢机的运转记录后，经常提供关于运转情况的资料，使停车时间减少了二分之一。本溪选矿厂在
    一九五二年通过原始记录发现一个班的工作成绩特别好，于是总结和推广了这个班的先进经验，使精矿品位达到了标准。
    现在许多厂矿的领导干部还没有充分认识到原始记录的重要性。本溪煤铁公司大多数领导干部把整顿原始记录看成是一种简单的事情，自己既不参加，也不组织各部门有关的干部参加，而只把这件重要的工作推给计划部门去作。少数领导干部因为不重视原始记录工作，还经常调动原始记录员。这种不正确的看法和作法，直接影响记录工作人员和工人对这一工作的重视。该公司煤矿修造厂有个记录员说：“原始记录有也行，没有也行，反正不起作用。”在这次加强计划管理工作中，有的单位根本未提原始记录，有的单位只计划用几天时间整理原始记录。这些都是对原始记录工作的重要性缺乏正确认识的具体表现。
    目前各厂矿的原始记录有一个普遍的缺点，这就是项目不完全，记载不确实，缺乏统一的管理制度，缺乏对各项记录及统计表报的通盘筹划，缺乏统一的计算方法。有的相互重复，有的残缺不全。日报与月报不符，车间数字与计划、会计等部门数字不符，而且时常前后矛盾。更严重的是个别单位有虚报成绩、虚列数字的现象。这当然不能发挥及时、全面、正确地反映生产情况和指导生产的作用。
    各厂矿在加强计划管理中，一定要端正全体职工对原始记录的认识，针对目前存在的缺点，根据计划管理的需要，认真进行一次整顿原始记录的工作，务使原始数字真正成为生产活动的具体记载，成为改善和提高企业管理水平的重要根据。
