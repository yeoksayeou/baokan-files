Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 29th: On the eve of "July 1st," all the employees building the Tianshui-Chengdu Railway wrote to Chairman Mao to report to their most beloved leader on the achievements of the railway construction. This letter was first discussed by various groups, and then summarized and written by the Railway Construction Bureau. The full text is as follows:

Respected Chairman Mao:

Following your instructions of July 1st last year, "Celebrating the opening of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway and continuing efforts to build the Tianshui-Chengdu Railway," we have been building the Tianshui-Chengdu Railway for a year. Now we want to report to you: we have completed more than 5.2 million cubic meters of earth and stone work for the roadbed, 1,927 meters of large and medium-sized bridges, 204 small bridges and culverts, and 322 meters of tunnels. Currently, the track has been laid to Guanghan County, more than 38 kilometers away from Chengdu.

In the past year, our entire workforce has made a total of more than 12,000 inventions, creations, and rationalization proposals. Among them, the engineering and technical personnel of the South Section Alignment Committee of the Tianshui-Chengdu Railway alone proposed rationalization proposals during the re-survey of the line, which shortened the line by 25 kilometers and saved the country a huge amount of wealth. The 17th Survey and Design Team proposed 760 rationalization proposals, saving the country 126.4 billion yuan. We also launched a patriotic socialist labor emulation drive, and many production models and activists emerged. In order to conquer the particularly hard rock in the tunnel, the Tang Wenbin team of the Bamiaogou Tunnel Team created the "central blasting method," which saved a lot of explosives. Ironworker team leader Li Xiushan created the "saltwater dipping drill bit method," which greatly reduced the consumption of drill bits used for drilling blasting holes; veteran stonemason Ren Ji'an created the "jumping chisel stone cutting method," which increased the output of cut stone by 170% compared to the standard worker. The track laying and bridge erecting team created a record of four holes per day when erecting 10.8-meter T-beams, completing 200% of the quota. In order to complete the underwater sealing project of the bridge pier caissons of the Fujiang Bridge before the flood season, workers, engineers, and technicians conducted nine experiments and finally successfully tested the method of pouring concrete underwater using a fixed conduit method. Now, eighteen piers of the bridge have been erected in the Fujiang River.

Respected Chairman Mao: The fact that the Tianshui-Chengdu Railway can carry out various engineering constructions according to the latest standards is inseparable from your instruction to us to learn and apply the advanced experience of the Soviet Union. In the past year, in addition to the widespread promotion of various Soviet advanced experiences that had already been adopted on the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, we have further adopted the "culvert section installation method," the "clearing before stone laying method," and the "funnel excavation method" in tunnels with the specific assistance of Soviet experts. These methods have increased the efficiency of the project by one-third to two times. In order to understand the engineering design, Soviet expert Troyanov went deep into the site for investigation and research, forgetting to eat and sleep, and put forward 39 suggestions for us, which greatly improved the quality of railway construction. His spirit of lofty internationalist friendship deeply moved us.

The farmers along the Tianshui-Chengdu Railway were very welcoming when they heard that we were railway workers sent by you. Tens of thousands of farmers in more than ten counties, including Xindu, Guanghan, and Mianyang, also voluntarily organized to help us transport materials, deliver grain, wash river sand, and dig bridge foundations. More than 480 farmers in Qingyi Township, Mianyang, heard that the Fujiang Bridge must be completed before the flood season, and they voluntarily carried dragon bone waterwheels to the construction site to help us drain water and dig bridge foundations. Many farmers also sent us condolences. Their enthusiastic support has powerfully encouraged our courage and confidence in completing the construction of the Tianshui-Chengdu Railway.

Respected Chairman Mao: There are still many shortcomings in our work, and there will be many difficulties in future work. But we believe that under your wise leadership and the leadership of the Communist Party, and with the support of the people of Southwest China, we will surely overcome all difficulties. We assure you that we will definitely complete the glorious task you have given us to build the Tianshui-Chengdu Railway.

Respectfully wishing you good health!

All employees building the Tianshui-Chengdu Railway, June 26, 1953

    修筑天成铁路的全体职工在“七一”前夕
    写信给毛主席报告筑路成绩
    【新华社成都二十九日电】“七一”前夕，修筑天（水）成（都）铁路的全体职工写信给毛主席，向自己最敬爱的领袖报告筑路的成绩。这封信先经过各小组讨论，然后由铁路施工局总结写成，全文如下：敬爱的毛主席：
    我们遵循您去年七月一日“庆贺成渝铁路通车，继续努力修筑天成路”的指示，修筑天成铁路已经一年了。现在我们要向您报告：我们已经完成了路基土石方五百二十多万立方公尺，大、中桥梁一千九百二十七公尺，小桥涵渠二百零四座，隧道三百二十二公尺，目前已铺轨到离成都三十八公里多的广汉县城。
    一年来，我们全体职工的发明、创造和合理化建议共有一万二千多件，其中仅天成铁路南段选线委员会的工程技术人员们在重新勘测线路的工作中提出的合理化建议，就使线路缩短了二十五公里，给国家节约了巨量的财富。第十七勘测设计总队提出的七百六十件合理化建议，给国家节约了一千二百六十四亿元。我们还展开了爱国主义优胜循环红旗竞赛，涌现了许多生产模范，积极分子。八庙沟隧道队唐文斌小组为了征服隧道中的特坚石，创造了“中心放炮法”，节省了大量炸药。铁工组长李秀山创造了“盐水沾釬法”，使打炮眼消耗的釬子大大减少；老石工任吉安创造“跳锲截石法”，开料石比标准工高出百分之一百七十。钉道架桥队在架设十点八公尺的丁字梁时，创造了每日四孔的纪录，完成了定额百分之二百。为了在洪水前作好涪江大桥的桥基沉箱封底工程，工人和工程师技术人员经过九次试验，终于把使用固定导管法在水中灌注混凝土的方法试验成功，现在，大桥的十八个桥墩已在涪江中树立起来。
    敬爱的毛主席：天成铁路能按照最新的标准进行各项工程施工，是与您指示我们学习和运用苏联先进经验分不开的。一年来，全线除普遍推广成渝铁路上已经采用过的各种苏联先进经验外，还在苏联专家的具体帮助下，进一步采用了“涵洞分节安砌法”、“先清后安砌石法”和隧道中的“漏斗开挖法”，这些方法使工程的效率提高三分之一到二倍。苏联专家特洛杨诺夫为了了解工程设计，曾废寝忘食地深入现场调查研究，给我们提出了三十九件建议，大大提高了铁路建设的质量，他这种高度国际主义的友爱精神，深深地感动了我们。
    天成铁路沿线的农民，听说我们是您派来的铁路工人，都很欢迎我们。新都、广汉、绵阳等十多个县成万的农民也都自动组织起来，帮助我们运材料、送粮食、淘河沙、挖桥基。绵阳青义乡的四百八十多个农民，听说涪江大桥必须要在洪水前修好，都自动将龙骨水车抬到工地，帮助我们车水和挖桥基，许多农民兄弟还给我们送来慰问品。他们对我们的热烈支援，有力地鼓舞着我们完成修筑天成铁路的勇气和信心。
    敬爱的毛主席：我们工作中还存在着不少缺点，未来工作中也还有很多困难。但是我们相信：在您和共产党的英明领导下，在西南人民的支援下，我们一定能战胜一切困难。我们向您保证：一定要把您交给我们的修筑天成铁路的光荣任务胜利完成。
       敬祝
    您健康！
       修筑天成铁路全体职工上　一九五三年六月二十六日
