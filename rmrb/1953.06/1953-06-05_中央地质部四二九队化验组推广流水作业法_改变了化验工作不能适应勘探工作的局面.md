The Chemical Analysis Group of the 429 Team of the Central Geological Department Popularizes the Assembly Line Method, Changing the Situation Where Chemical Analysis Work Could Not Adapt to Exploration Work

The Chemical Analysis Group of the 429 Team of the Central Geological Department adopted the assembly line method and achieved great gains in the analysis of iron ore, fundamentally changing the situation where chemical analysis work could not meet the needs of large-scale geological exploration work.

In the past, the labor intensity of the chemical analysis personnel of the 429 Team was very high, but the efficiency was very low, because one person had to complete the entire chemical analysis work of each mineral sample. New trainees could not learn this whole set of techniques in a short period of time, and could not get involved in the work. At the same time, this method of operation could not fully utilize the effectiveness of the instruments. Therefore, the chemical analysis work lagged far behind the needs of the exploration work, and a large number of mineral samples were backloged. When the task was urgent, they had to be transported to places thousands of miles away to ask other units for help with the analysis. In October of last year, the chemical analysis group accepted the advanced experience of the Chemical Analysis Laboratory of the Nanjing Office of the Central Geological Department and implemented the assembly line method. The work results of three months exceeded four times that of the previous five months (May to September), and the work task for 1952 was overfulfilled. For example, in October 1952, a group of five people analyzed 260 samples of total iron in iron ore within eight hours, more than twice the previous record (one person analyzed 15 samples of total iron in eight hours). At the beginning of 1953, the chemical analysis group summarized the past experiences and lessons, handed over the task to the masses for discussion, formulated a detailed work plan, and appropriately organized the strength to further advance the work on the original basis. Although the work plan for the first quarter of 1953 (1338 iron ore samples, each mineral sample is in principle analyzed for five elements: total iron, ferrous iron, copper, phosphorus, and sulfur) was even larger than the annual plan for last year (1302 iron ore samples), they still victoriously completed 106.1% of the first quarter's task.

After the chemical analysis laboratory implemented the assembly line method, the labor productivity of chemical analysts has been greatly improved. Because the assembly line method divides an analysis process into several steps, which are undertaken by several people in division of labor and mutual cooperation, the work has a high degree of continuity; it can reduce auxiliary operations (such as adjusting instruments, etc.) and save a lot of time; the scope of operation for each person is reduced, the work is relatively simple, and a large number of trainees can quickly learn the local operations of the analysis process and enrich the chemical analysis strength. For example, trainee Chen Bingrong was able to participate in the analysis groups of total iron, ferrous iron, copper, phosphorus and other elements and independently undertake analysis work in less than a month after joining the work. This method of operation can fully utilize the effectiveness of the instruments, making all instruments uniformly allocated and centrally used. And save electricity consumption, such as electric furnaces and electric hot plates saving more than 30% of electricity after continuous use. Because the assembly line method is a collective operation, it can give play to the wisdom of the masses to find tricks and create tools and instruments suitable for new work methods. For example, Wang Jigui improved the device of the suction filter to replace the past method of liquid separation by sucking with the mouth, which not only improved work efficiency but also eliminated the corrosion of the oral cavity by drugs.

When implementing the assembly line method, it is necessary to establish the concept of collectivism and eliminate the old ideology - the go-it-alone ideology. At the beginning, some people thought that it would be easier to make mistakes when several people were working on one job. In fact, as long as the connection work of each process is done well, not only will it not be easy to make mistakes, but also experience can be exchanged. Because the assembly line method is a large-scale operation method, the instruments and equipment must be adapted to this need, otherwise, it will affect the smooth progress of the work. Such as large heating equipment (electric hot plates, Muffle furnaces, etc.) and a large number of funnels, beakers, volumetric flasks, colorimetric tubes and other glass instruments. These are very cheap ordinary instruments, and they are also easy to buy. The equipment of the chemical analysis laboratory itself must also be suitable for the new needs. If the ventilation equipment is insufficient, it will be difficult to discharge acid gas during large-scale operations, which will greatly affect the health of the staff. Due to the emergence of new work methods, there must be a work system and management method that adapt to the new work methods. Such as the instrument and medicine distribution system, work inspection system, etc., should be formulated according to the specific situation to avoid confusion.

    中央地质部四二九队化验组推广流水作业法
    改变了化验工作不能适应勘探工作的局面
    中央地质部四二九队化验组采用了流水作业法，在分析铁矿的工作中有了很大的收获，根本上改变了化验工作不能适应大规模地质勘探工作需要的局面。
    过去四二九队化验人员的劳动强度很高，但是效率很低，因为一个人要把每个矿样的化验工作全部做完；新来的练习生，在短时间内不能学会这一整套的技术，工作插不上手；同时，这种操作方法也不能充分发挥仪器的效能。因此，化验工作远远落后于勘探工作的需要，大批矿样被积压起来，任务紧迫时，就不得不把它运到千里以外的地方去请别的单位帮助化验。去年十月份，化验组接受了中央地质部南京办事处化验室的先进经验，实行流水作业法。三个月的工作成果，超过了以前五个月（五月到九月）的四倍，并且超计划地完成了一九五二年的工作任务。例如在一九五二年十月份一个五人组成的小组在八小时内分析铁矿中全铁二百六十个，超过了过去最高纪录（一人八小时分析全铁十五个）二倍多。在一九五三年的开始，化验组总结了过去的经验教训，把任务交给群众讨论，详细制订工作计划，并且适当地组织力量，使工作在原有的基础上又推进了一步。虽然一九五三年第一季度工作计划（一三三八个铁矿样，每个矿样原则上分析全铁、亚铁、铜、磷、硫五项元素）较去年全年计划（一三○二个铁矿样）还大，他们还是胜利地完成了第一季度任务的百分之一百零六点一。
    化验室实行流水作业法后，使化验工作者的劳动生产率大大地提高了。因为流水作业法将一个分析过程分为若干步骤，由几个人分工担任，互相配合，使工作具有高度的连续性；可以减少附属作业（如调整仪器等），节省很多时间；每个人的操作范围缩小了，工作比较简单，大批练习生能够很快学会分析过程的局部操作，充实化验力量。如练习生陈炳荣参加工作不到一个月，就能参加到全铁、亚铁、铜、磷等元素的分析小组里，独立担任分析工作。这种操作方法能够充分发挥仪器的效能，使所有仪器统一分配，集中使用。并且节省电力消耗，如电炉、电热板在连续使用后就节省电百分之三十以上。因流水作业法是集体操作，可以发挥群众智慧找出窍门，创造适合新的工作方法的工具与仪器装置。例如王吉桂改良抽滤器的装置代替过去用嘴吸进行分液的方法，不仅提高了工作效率，并且免除了药品对口腔的腐蚀。
    在实行流水作业法时，必须树立集体主义的观念，清除旧的思想——单干思想。开始，有些人认为一个工作由几个人来搞，人多手稠容易产生错误。事实上，只要作好各工序的衔接工作，不但不容易产生错误，并且可以交流经验。因为流水作业法是大规模的操作方法，仪器设备必须适应这种需要，否则，会影响工作的顺利进行。如大的加热设备（电热板、茂福电炉等）及大量的漏斗、烧杯、量瓶、比色管等玻璃仪器。这些都是很便宜的普通仪器，购买也很容易。化验室本身设备，也要适合新的需要。如果通风设备不足，大规模操作时，酸气排出困难，会使工作人员的健康受到极大影响。由于新的工作方法的出现，就必须有一个适应新的工作方法的工作制度及管理方法。如仪器药品的领发制度、工作检查制度等，都要根据具体情况制订，以免发生混乱现象。    （马安仁）
