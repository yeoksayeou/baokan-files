    Rapidly Improve the Quality of Coal Production
    The inspection team of the Ministry of Fuel Industry and the Coal Mine Management Bureau of the Central People's Government recently inspected the production situation of state-owned coal mines in various regions and found that the quality of coal production has generally declined, with a large increase in ash content and gangue, etc. According to incomplete statistics from the Coal Mine Management Bureau, it is estimated that in the first quarter of this year, state-owned coal mines across the country shipped out 100,8498 tons of stone, wasting 13 billion yuan in transportation costs. The China Coal Industry Construction Materials Company lost over 10 billion yuan in freight and capital in the first four months of this year due to the large amount of gangue mixed in the coal produced by state-owned coal mines. More seriously, poor coal quality directly affects the reduction of industrial production output, increases the rate of defective and substandard products, and causes a series of adverse consequences. Taking iron smelting as an example, poor coal quality affects the increase of ash content in coke; the increase of ash content in coke affects the reduction of output and quality of the iron smelting department; and further affects the quality of steel and the product quality of the machinery manufacturing industry. Our country's industrial production is a scientific organism, and any defect in any link will inevitably affect the overall situation and cause many adverse consequences.
    The main reason for the increasingly poor coal quality of state-owned coal mines in various regions is that the leading cadres of many state-owned coal mines, including some leaders in the coal mine management departments, have long held a one-sided view of tasks in their actual work. That is, they one-sidedly value output, efficiency, and cost, while placing quality in an unimportant, dispensable position. They do not comprehensively understand the inseparable connection between these four indicators, but mistakenly split them apart, even opposing them. They believe that completing the output is completing the task, emphasizing the difficulty of selection, and emphasizing the lack of screening and washing equipment. Therefore, they have not paid attention to the reflection of poor coal quality, but are waiting for equipment and investment. They have not realized the losses caused by poor coal quality to various economic sectors of the country, and therefore have abandoned various measures that are currently feasible to improve quality, and are not actively trying to select, nor are they improving mining methods.
    Under the guidance of this erroneous thinking, many state-owned coal mines have not discussed or rarely discussed quality issues for a long time; there is no system to ensure quality at all, or if there is a system, it is extremely unsound and exists in name only; they do not conduct regular inspections of product quality; they do not conduct regular and in-depth education for employees to improve quality; they do not establish or are unwilling to enrich the institutions and equipment necessary to ensure quality (such as organizing coal sorting workers, improving testing institutions, etc.). Chen Yaode, the mine manager of Datai Mine in Jingxi Coal Mine, and other individual leaders even took the lead in mixing a large amount of ineffective inferior coal into good coal. In this case, employees generally ignore quality, labor discipline is lax, and the result is that "output" increases, but quality deteriorates day by day, and the country's losses are getting bigger and bigger.
    The Ministry of Fuel Industry and the Coal Mine Management Bureau of the Central People's Government have now decided to launch a campaign to improve coal quality in coal mines across the country, which is very necessary. To do this work well, we must first recognize that the idea and practice of only pursuing output and not caring about quality is fundamentally contrary to the principles of state-owned enterprise management; and completing quality indicators and continuously improving quality is the basic requirement for completing production tasks. Therefore, the work of improving coal quality cannot be treated as a simple technical problem, but must be regarded as a fierce and long-term ideological struggle, and in particular, the problem of leadership thinking must be solved first. Obviously, the poor quality of coal is no longer a general shortcoming, but a sabotage of the economic construction cause, which is absolutely not allowed. We must quickly put this issue on the important agenda and earnestly study and improve it.
    To improve the quality of coal, we must also mobilize the masses to solve it. We must use various methods (such as holding exhibitions, soliciting user opinions, and making detailed calculations, etc.) to carry out publicity and education work, so that everyone can recognize the harm of poor coal quality to the country's economic construction and people's lives, and analyze the reasons for poor coal quality, and mobilize the masses of employees to find ways to improve quality and improve mining methods. At the same time, in order to ensure improved quality, we must also establish and improve production management systems on the basis of mobilizing the masses, such as the level-by-level responsibility system, a strict product inspection system, and an incentive system, etc., to effectively overcome the phenomenon of no one being responsible.
    In order to quickly change the current serious situation, the leaders of state-owned coal mines in various regions must also immediately take some effective technical measures, such as restoring screening in mines with screening equipment, and organizing manual selection in those without screening equipment; reasonably stipulating the progressive wage for exceeding the amount of gangue selection, improving the mining methods for coal seams with more gangue, and establishing or strengthening quality inspection work departments and laboratory work, etc. Today, many coal mine leaders simply rely on and wait for mechanical washing equipment, but do not immediately start the manual selection work that can be done now, and this attitude should be corrected.
    The work of improving coal quality is urgent, and state-owned coal mines in various regions should immediately start this work and strive to make achievements quickly.

### 迅速提高产煤的质量

    迅速提高产煤的质量
    中央人民政府燃料工业部和煤矿管理总局检查组最近检查各地国营煤矿的生产情况，发现产煤的质量普遍下降，煤中的灰分和夹杂的矸石等等大量增加。据煤矿管理总局从不完全的统计材料加以推算，今年第一季度各地国营煤矿运出的煤中，就夹杂了石头十万零八千四百九十八吨，浪费了运输费用一百三十亿元；中国煤业建筑器材公司在今年的四个月中，由于国营煤矿出产的煤里掺杂了大量矸石，损失运费和资金一百余亿元。更严重的是由于煤质低劣，直接影响到工业生产产量降低、废品次品率增加，并造成一系列的恶果。如以炼铁来说，煤质低劣影响到焦炭灰分增大；焦炭灰分加大，又影响炼铁部门产量减少，质量降低；更进一步影响到钢的质量和机器制造业的产品质量。我们国家的工业生产本是一个科学的有机体，任何一个环节上发生了缺陷，势必影响全局，引起许多恶果。
    各地国营煤矿煤质日益低劣的主要原因，是许多国营煤矿的领导干部，包括煤矿管理部门的一些领导人在内，在实际工作中长期存在着一种片面的任务观点。这就是片面地重视产量、效率、成本，而把质量放在一个不重要的、可有可无的位置上。他们不是全面地来理解这四个指标之间相互不可分割的联系，而是把它们错误地分裂开来，甚至对立起来。他们认为完成产量就算完成任务，强调拣选困难，强调没有筛选洗选设备，因此他们对于煤质低劣的反映没有加以注意，而在等待设备，等待投资，没有认识到煤质低劣对国家各种经济部门所造成的损失，因此也就放弃了目前完全可行的提高质量的各种措施，不积极设法拣选，不去改进采煤方法。
    在这种错误思想的指导下，许多国营煤矿长期不讨论或很少讨论质量问题；根本没有保证质量的制度，或者有了制度也极不健全，形同虚设；他们不对产品质量进行经常的检查；他们不对职工经常深入地进行提高质量的教育；他们不去建立或不肯充实为保证质量所必不可缺的机构和设备（例如组织选煤工人，健全化验机构等）。京西煤矿大台矿矿长陈耀德等个别领导人员，甚至带头把大量失效的劣煤掺到好煤里去。在这种情况下，职工们也就普遍忽视质量，劳动纪律松弛，结果是“产量”增加了，但质量却一天坏一天，国家的损失也愈来愈大。
    中央人民政府燃料工业部和煤矿管理总局现在已决定在各地煤矿中展开一个改善煤质的运动，这是十分必要的。要做好这一工作，首先就需要认清：只求产量、不问质量的思想和做法，是根本违反国营企业经营的原则的；而完成质量指标、不断提高质量乃是完成生产任务的基本要求。因此提高煤质的工作，就不能作为一个简单的技术问题来处理，必须把它看成是一场激烈的长期的思想斗争，特别是必须首先解决领导思想问题。显然的，煤的质量低劣，这已经不是一般性质的缺点，而是对于经济建设事业的一个破坏，这是绝对不能容许的。我们必须迅速把这个问题提到重要的议事日程上来，切实加以研究改进。
    要提高煤的质量，还必须发动群众来解决。必须运用各种方式（如举办展览会、征求用户意见，算细帐等），进行宣传教育工作，使大家认识到煤质低劣对于国家经济建设和人民生活的危害性，并分析煤质低劣的原因，发动职工群众想办法改进质量，改进采煤方法。同时，为了保证提高质量，还必须在发动群众的基础上，建立并健全生产管理制度，例如逐级的责任制、严格的产品检验制和奖励制度等等，切实克服无人负责的现象。
    为了迅速改变目前的严重状况，各地国营煤矿的领导方面还必须立即采取一些有效的技术措施，例如有筛选设备的矿山应即恢复筛选，没有筛选设备的就组织手选；并合理地规定选矸的超额累进工资，改进夹矸石多的煤层的开采方法，建立或加强质量检查的工作部门和化验工作等等。今天有不少煤矿领导人单纯依赖和等待机械洗选设备，而不立即着手眼前就可以做到的手选工作，这种态度应该纠正。
    改进煤质的工作已急不容缓，各地国营煤矿应即着手进行这一工作，争取迅速地做出成绩来。
