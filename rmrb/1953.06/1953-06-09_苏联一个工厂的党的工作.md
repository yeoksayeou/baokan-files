    Party Work in a Soviet Factory
    By Li He, Special Correspondent in Moscow for this newspaper
    I have visited the "Moskvich" small car factory three times. The first time was in the summer of 1951, when the factory became the first enterprise of collective Stakhanovite labor among all automobile factories in the Soviet Union; the second time was in the summer of 1952, when the factory workers were striving to collectively produce superior quality products; the third time was recently, when the factory workers were working hard to complete the five-year plan ahead of schedule and to further improve labor productivity and product quality.
    The "Moskvich" automobile factory was established before the Soviet Patriotic War, but it only began mass production after the war. A decisive factor in its becoming an advanced enterprise is the good work of the Party organization within the factory. In September 1952, Comrade N.S. Khrushchev praised the achievements of the factory's Party organization in leading the competition, conducting education, and supervising production at the Moscow Oblast Party Conference of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. He pointed out: "The improvement of the Party's political work has prompted the factory to successfully complete the state plan and the socialist responsibilities it has undertaken."
    Recently, I consulted Comrade Ya. Yakovlev, the director of the factory, about the role of the Party organization in the factory, and read Comrade N. Fizhitskin, the secretary of the factory Party committee, describing the factory's experience in Party work. I will now briefly introduce it.
    Turning Backwardness into Advancement
    In 1949 and the first half of 1950, production at the "Moskvich" automobile factory was uneven: 28 percent of the monthly output was produced in the first ten days, 30 percent in the second ten days, and 41.1 percent in the third ten days. As a result, the production plans for the fourth quarter of 1949 and the first quarter of 1950 were not fulfilled, and labor discipline and technical discipline within the factory were also lax. A major reason for the backwardness was that the Party work was not being grasped firmly, and the leading personnel of the administration and Party organizations were not good at giving play to the creative initiative of all the workers and tolerated the shortcomings in production. In June 1950, at the meeting of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, the work of the "Moskvich" automobile factory was criticized. This criticism inspired all the workers in the factory. Party members and the masses expressed their desire to overcome the backward phenomena in production. The factory Party committee seized this opportunity and convened active elements to discuss how to launch a campaign to strive to complete the plan. Active elements put forward opinions on strengthening the Party's political work and organizational work, especially on improving the leadership of the socialist competition. Members of the factory Party committee, secretaries of Party branches in workshops, and leaders of Party groups went deep into production, listened to the masses' opinions on overcoming the shortcomings in production. Party branches and Party groups began to regularly discuss these opinions and strictly supervised the implementation of decisions to correct the shortcomings. The Party committee began to regularly listen to reports from the heads of lower-level Party organizations and provided systematic assistance to lower-level Party organizations. The Party organization mobilized Communists to help the trade union absorb the broad masses of workers to participate in socialist competition, and summarized, announced, and discussed the results of the competition. The Party organization mobilized propagandists, news bulletins, and wall newspapers. The Party organization supported the factory administration's instructions and measures on strengthening production and labor discipline, improving labor organization, and striving to complete and exceed production tasks with these tasks. Therefore, in the second half of 1950, the backward phenomena were completely overcome. The factory workers received the mobile Red Banner of Merit from the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions and the Soviet Ministry of Automobile and Tractor Industry in the third and fourth quarters. The 1950 production plan was completed ahead of schedule.
    At this time, factories such as the "Kaliber" factory and the Second Bearing Factory became enterprises of collective Stakhanovite labor. The workers of the "Moskvich" automobile factory also had this desire. The factory Party committee immediately supported this request. Advanced production groups and technical personnel, Party and trade union activists, were sent to Stakhanovite factories to observe and brought back advanced experience. The Party committee invited the secretary of the Party committee of the Second Bearing Factory to report to the Party activists on how the Party organization of the Bearing Factory ensured that the Bearing Factory became an enterprise of collective Stakhanovite labor. The Party organization mobilized propagandists to explain to each worker, using specific factories as examples, what a Stakhanovite factory is and the important significance of striving to become a Stakhanovite factory. According to the suggestion of the Party committee, the factory management department and the trade union committee formulated the conditions for the socialist competition of each workshop, branch, section, and production group to obtain the title of Stakhanovite collective. After the competition plan was formulated, the Party committee vigorously organized the workers to realize it. First of all, a meeting of directors of each workshop, secretaries of Party branches, chairmen of trade union committees, and secretaries of Communist Youth League branches was convened. The meeting discussed the specific work of the Party, administration, trade union, and Youth League, such as promoting experience, strengthening publicity, etc. A few days later, open Party meetings with mass participation were held in each workshop and department, specifically discussing the tasks of Party work in striving to become a Stakhanovite factory. Subsequently, production meetings were held in each workshop, branch, and section. In addition, the Party committee consulted with economic personnel, quota personnel, and accounting personnel on the tasks facing the factory, and instructed the personnel of the General Technical Department and the General Electrical Department to meticulously prepare the equipment, and the chief engineer invited technical and design personnel to study the adoption of new technologies and technical procedures. The factory also obtained assistance from scientific institutions. The trade union management department and the trade union committee jointly convened the directors of the workshops and the chairmen of the trade union committees to formulate measures to strengthen labor discipline. The Communist Youth League members established a social inspection of the cleanliness and tidiness of the work places. In December 1950, the youth production group of Yulia Skobeleva in the car body workshop was the first to reach the standards stipulated by the factory and became a production group working collectively in the Stakhanovite style. Skobeleva was invited by various workshops to introduce her experience. Subsequently, the number of Stakhanovite production groups increased. The Party organization paid attention to guiding the workers, so that the factory gradually became a Stakhanovite collective, from production groups to sections, to branches, to workshops, and finally to the factory. In June 1951, the Soviet Ministry of Automobile and Tractor Industry and the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions gave the factory the title of enterprise of collective Stakhanovite labor.
    In the tradition of the Communist Party, there is no complacency with existing achievements. Based on the high morale of all the workers, the Party organization of the "Moskvich" automobile factory immediately put forward the call to make its Stakhanovite factory an enterprise producing superior quality products, according to the tasks of socialist competition instructed by the Party and the government. The Party organization carried out intense political and organizational work again. Propagandists explained to all the workers that a Stakhanovite factory that produces superior quality products must work rhythmically according to the indicated chart, must overfulfill the tasks of increasing labor productivity and reducing product costs, and must minimize the permissible waste losses; such a factory should be an enterprise with a high level of production technology, and the people in such a factory should be highly conscious laborers. As in the previous stage, the factory Party committee consulted with active elements again, and organized all the workers to realize the new goal. Each Party group checked the production situation of each section in striving to become a superior quality section. Any violation of technical discipline or the phenomenon of producing inferior products was brought to Party groups, trade union groups, production meetings, and workers' meetings for discussion. The Party groups paid special attention to promoting the advanced experience of
    "completing each production operation in an excellent way." Open Party meetings of workshops and departments regularly studied product quality issues and made concrete decisions. Representatives from the factory's administrative, Party, and technical departments participated in such meetings in order to quickly resolve any technical problems that might arise. The Party branch committees of the workshops also regularly discussed the implementation of plans to improve product quality. The Party organization also convened separate meetings of technicians and designers, meetings of branch directors and foremen, and meetings of technical inspection staff to come up with all possible ways to improve product quality. Around the general goal of improving the quality of "Moskvich" automobiles, propagandists, news bulletins, and wall newspapers carried out mobilization work, and trade unions and Communist Youth League organizations also carried out a lot of work. The factory management department formulated and implemented a plan to improve the quality of automobiles. As of September 1952, the factory had 255 production groups, 105 sections, 40 branches, and 10 workshops that had become collectives producing superior quality products.
    The Party organization of the "Moskvich" automobile factory supported the factory administration in this way, enabling the enterprise to break away from backwardness and enter the ranks of the advanced.
    From the process of the "Moskvich" automobile factory becoming an advanced enterprise, we have seen that the Party organization of a factory is the soul of that factory's life. The Party organization of the "Moskvich" automobile factory has accumulated a lot of experience in many aspects.
    Ensuring the Completion of Production Tasks
    The Party organization of the "Moskvich" automobile factory regards ensuring the completion or overfulfillment of production tasks as its central work.
    At the beginning of each year, the factory workers summarize the work of the previous year and discuss the production tasks assigned by the state for the current year, looking for possibilities to overfulfill the plan. This discussion is conducted in production groups, sections, branches, workshops and departments, and at meetings of Party, trade union, and administrative activists in the factory. In this way, the opinions of many people are absorbed to formulate competition plans from the production group to the entire factory. After all the workers have undertaken the competition tasks, the Party organization and the trade union organization do not relax but rather grasp the leadership of the competition more firmly.
    The competition tasks of the factory, workshops, branches, sections, and production groups are hung in conspicuous places to remind every worker to pay attention. From the beginning of the month, the production results of each worker, production group, section, branch, workshop, and the entire factory yesterday are announced to all the competing workers every day to stimulate everyone's enthusiasm. The factory implements a personal account system. In a prominent place in each workshop, an account table of each worker is hung, which clearly records the worker's production situation. This encourages each worker to do their job better.
    Production meetings of workers and technicians are held two or three times a month in the workshops to check the completion of competition tasks and shortcomings, and to discuss product quality, costs, labor discipline, and so on. Full preparations are made before the production meeting: the time, place, and agenda of the meeting are announced; the workshop trade union committee guides the trade union activists to prepare the meeting materials and examines the production situation of certain sections. At the production meeting, the workshop director or deputy director usually makes a report first. Before the report, they first stated the implementation of the suggestions from the previous meeting. The people participating in the production meeting bravely expose the shortcomings, point out the specific responsible persons for the mistakes, and put forward suggestions for improving production. The factory Party committee, the workshop, and the Party branch committees of the departments pay attention to ensuring that production meetings are held regularly, pay attention to mobilizing self-criticism and criticism from below, and pay attention to the rapid implementation of valuable suggestions. A special person records the suggestions of the workers at the production meeting. After each production meeting, the workshop director convenes administrative and technical cadres to jointly stipulate the time limit for implementing these suggestions and the responsible personnel. The workshop trade union committee and its affiliated production committee regularly check the implementation of these suggestions.
    In order to enable workers in various departments to participate in the competition, the Party organization considered the characteristics and possibilities of each person's work, so it proposed the form of launching the competition according to occupation. Each month, advanced workers, technicians, and staff members are awarded the titles of "excellent worker of this occupation," "excellent foreman," "excellent technician," "excellent designer," "excellent bookkeeper," "excellent supplier," and so on. After the production meeting summarizes the monthly work, the workshop trade union committee evaluates the excellent production groups, sections, branches, and workers as winners of the competition. The factory trade union committee makes a summary of the factory's competition last month before the 14th of each month. Competition winners who have won the title of "Excellent Worker" for six consecutive months are listed on the honor roll and awarded a certificate of honor, and those who have won the title for more than one year are recorded in the honor book and receive a special certificate. More than two hundred workers in the "Moskvich" automobile factory have won the title of "Excellent Worker of Socialist Competition" awarded by the Ministry of Industry.
    There are many young workers in the factory. The factory Party organization is very concerned about the Communist Youth League organization and educates young people through them. The factory Party committee regularly listens to the reports of the Communist Youth League committee and the reports of the Party organization on the leadership of the Communist Youth League organization. It is required to have detailed individual talks with the new workers so as to give them specific help. The first people to talk to the newly arrived workers are the secretary of the Party branch in the workshop, the director of the workshop, and the secretary of the Communist Youth League branch. They also talk to the young workers every week about work and study. Experienced Communist Party workers voluntarily lead the young novices. Communist Youth League members actively help Party members organize socialist competition. Many advanced people have emerged among the youth.
    There are more than 300 foremen in the factory, who are basic-level cadres in the production process and play a major role in completing production tasks. The Party organization pays special attention to guiding them. Many foremen participate in the Party's education network, foreman training classes, secondary technical schools, and night schools of specialized colleges. In August 1952, the factory Party committee convened a meeting of all the foremen in the factory, reported to them the role of the foremen in educating the workers, and listened to their criticisms of the Party's work in the factory.
    The Party organization of the "Moskvich" automobile factory ensures the completion of production tasks in this way, with concrete and meticulous leadership. In 1952, the factory overfulfilled the production plan and manufactured 557 "Moskvich" automobiles more than planned. All the workers completed the competition tasks in renovating automobiles, reducing waste losses, increasing labor productivity, reducing product costs, and saving more than planned.

    苏联一个工厂的党的工作
    本报驻莫斯科特派记者  李何
    我到过“莫斯科人”小型汽车工厂三次。第一次在一九五一年夏天，那时工厂在全苏汽车工厂中第一个成为集体斯大哈诺夫式劳动的企业；第二次在一九五二年夏天，那时工厂职工正争取集体出产优等质量产品；第三次在最近，这时工厂职工为提前完成五年计划的任务，为进一步提高劳动生产率和产品质量而努力着。
    “莫斯科人”汽车工厂在苏联卫国战争以前已经建立，但在战后才开始大批生产。它之所以成为先进的企业，厂内党的工作做得好，是一个决定因素。一九五二年九月，尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫同志在苏联共产党莫斯科州代表会议上表扬了这个工厂的党的组织在领导竞赛、进行教育、监督生产各方面的成就，他指出：“党的政治工作的改善，促使工厂顺利地完成国家计划和所承担的社会主义责任。”
    不久前，我请教了这个工厂厂长雅·雅各甫列夫同志关于厂内党的组织的作用，读到了这个工厂党委书记尼·费知茨金同志叙述的厂内党的工作经验。现在把它扼要地介绍出来。
    变落后为先进
    “莫斯科人”汽车工厂在一九四九年和一九五零年上半年生产是不均衡的：每月第一旬出产汽车百分之二十八，第二旬百分之三十，第三旬百分之四十一·一。所以一九四九年第四季和一九五零年第一季的产量计划没有完成，厂内的劳动纪律和技术纪律也松弛了。落后现象产生的一个主要原因是：党的工作没有抓紧，行政和党组织的领导人员不善于发挥全体职工的创造积极性，容忍生产中的缺点。到了一九五零年六月，在苏联最高苏维埃会议上，“莫斯科人”汽车工厂的工作受到了批评。这个批评激发了全厂职工。党员和群众都表示了要克服生产中落后现象。工厂党委会抓紧这个机会，召集了积极分子商量怎样开展争取完成计划的运动。积极分子们提出了关于加强党的政治工作和组织工作，特别是关于改善社会主义竞赛的领导的意见。工厂党委会委员、车间党支部书记、党小组组长深入到了生产中去，倾听了群众关于克服生产中的缺点的意见。车间党支部和党小组开始经常地讨论这些意见，严格监督了改正缺点的决定的实现。党委会开始经常听取下级党组织负责人的汇报，给下级党组织以系统的帮助。党组织发动了共产党员去帮助工会吸收广大职工参加社会主义竞赛，总结、宣布和讨论竞赛的结果。党组织把宣传员、快报、墙报都动员起来了。党组织以这些工作支援了工厂行政所发布的关于加强生产和劳动纪律、改善劳动组织、争取完成和超过生产任务的指令和措施。因此，到了一九五零年下半年，落后现象完全克服了。工厂职工在第三、四两季得到了全苏工会中央理事会和苏联汽车与拖拉机工业部流动优胜红旗。一九五零年生产计划提前完成了。
    这时候，正好“加利伯”工厂、第二轴承工厂等成为集体斯大哈诺夫式劳动的企业。“莫斯科人”汽车工厂职工们也产生了这种愿望。工厂党委会立刻支持这种要求。先进的生产组和技术人员、党和工会的积极分子，被派去斯大哈诺夫式工厂观摩，带回来了先进经验。党委会邀请了第二轴承工厂党委书记，来向党的积极分子报告了轴承工厂党组织是怎样保证轴承工厂成为集体斯大哈诺夫式劳动的企业的。党组织发动了宣传员们，以具体工厂为例子，向每个职工解释，什么是斯大哈诺夫式工厂和争取成为斯大哈诺夫式工厂的重要意义。根据党委会的建议，工厂管理部和工会委员会制订了各车间、分间、工段、生产组取得斯大哈诺夫式集体的称号的社会主义竞赛条件。竞赛计划制订以后，党委会大力组织职工来实现它。首先，召集了各车间的主任、党支部书记、工会委员会主席和共青团支部书记的会议。在会议上讨论了党、政、工、青的具体工作，如像推广经验、加强宣传等等。过了几天，在各车间、各部举行了有群众参加的党的公开会议，专门讨论在争取成为斯大哈诺夫式工厂中党的工作任务。随后，各车间、分间、工段举行了生产会议。另外，党委会和经济人员、定额人员、会计人员商量了工厂所面临的任务，嘱托了总技师部和总电力师部的人员精细地准备设备，并且由总工程师邀请了技术和设计人员研究采用新的技术和技术手续。工厂还取得了科学机关的帮助。工会管理部和工会委员会共同召集了车间的主任和工会委员会主席制订加强劳动纪律的办法。共青团员们建立了对工作地点的清洁和整齐的社会检查。一九五零年十二月，车台车间尤里亚·斯科别列娃青年生产组第一个达到了工厂所规定的标准，成为集体斯大哈诺夫式工作的生产组。斯科别列娃被各个车间邀请了去介绍经验。接着，斯大哈诺夫式生产组加多了。党组织注意引导了职工，使由生产组而工段、而分间、而车间、而工厂，逐步都成为斯大哈诺夫式的集体。一九五一年六月，苏联汽车与拖拉机工业部和全苏工会中央理事会给了工厂以集体斯大哈诺夫式劳动的企业的称号。
    在共产党人的传统中是没有自满于已有成绩这件事的。“莫斯科人”汽车工厂的党组织，在全厂职工情绪高涨的基础上，根据党和政府所指示的社会主义竞赛的任务，立刻提出了使自己斯大哈诺夫式工厂成为出产优等质量产品的企业的号召。党组织又进行了紧张的政治工作和组织工作。宣传员们向全体职工解释了：出产优等质量产品的斯大哈诺夫式工厂要有节奏地按指示图表工作，要超计划地完成提高劳动生产率和减低产品成本的任务，要尽量减少许可的废品损失；这种工厂应该是具有高度生产技术的企业，这种工厂的人们应该是高度自觉的劳动者。像前一阶段一样，工厂党委会又和积极分子商量了，又组织了全体职工来实现新的目标。各个党小组检查了各个工段在争取成为优等质量的工段中的生产情形。任何违反技术手续的纪律或出产劣品的现象，都拿到了党小组、工会小组、生产会议、职工会议上面去讨论。党小组特别注意了推广
    “优等地完成每一个生产操作”的先进经验。车间和部的党的公开会议经常研究了产品质量问题，并且作出了具体决定。工厂的行政、党和技术部门派了代表参加这种会议，以便迅速解决可能产生的技术问题。车间党支部委员会也经常讨论提高产品质量的计划执行的情况。党组织还单独召开技师和设计师会议、分间主任和领班会议、技术检查工作人员会议，为提高产品质量想尽办法。围绕着提高“莫斯科人”汽车的质量这个总目标，宣传员、快报、壁报进行了鼓动工作，工会和共青团组织也进行了许多工作。工厂管理部制订了和实施了提高汽车质量的计划。截至一九五二年九月，工厂已有二百五十五个生产组、一百零五个工段，四十个分间和十个车间，成为出产优等质量产品的集体。
    “莫斯科人”汽车工厂党组织就是这样支援了工厂行政，使企业脱离落后景况，进入先进行列。
    从“莫斯科人”汽车工厂变成先进企业的过程中，我们看到了一个工厂的党组织是这个工厂生命中的灵魂。“莫斯科人”汽车工厂党组织在许多方面积累了很多经验。
    保证完成生产任务
    “莫斯科人”汽车工厂党组织把保证完成或超计划地完成生产任务当作自己的中心工作。
    工厂职工在每年年初总结去年工作，同时讨论国家交给的本年生产任务，寻找超额完成计划的可能性。在生产组、工段、分间、车间和部里，在工厂党的、工会的、行政的积极分子会议上，进行这种讨论。这样，吸收众多人们的意见制订了从生产组到全厂的竞赛计划。在全体职工承担了竞赛任务以后，党组织和工会组织不是放松而是更加抓紧领导竞赛。
    工厂、车间、分间、工段和生产组的竞赛任务，挂在注目的地点，以提醒每个职工的注意。从月初起，每天向全体竞赛职工宣布每个工人、生产组、工段、分间、车间和全厂昨天生产成绩，以激发大家的积极性。工厂实行着个人账户制度。在每个车间的显著地点，挂着每个工人的账户表，表上鲜明地记录着这个工人的生产情况。这样鼓励每个工人把工作做得更好。
    在车间里每月举行两三次工人和技术人员的生产会议，来检查竞赛任务完成的情形和缺点，讨论产品质量、成本和劳动纪律等等。生产会议前作充分的准备：布告会议的时间、地点和议题；车间工会委员会指导工会积极分子准备会议材料，考查某些工段的生产情况。生产会议上一般先由车间主任或副主任作报告。报告前，他们先说了前次会议上的建议实现的情形。参加生产会议的人们勇敢地揭发缺点，指出过错的具体负责者，提出改进生产的建议。工厂党委会、车间和部的党支部委员会，注意使生产会议经常举行，注意发动从下面来的自我批评和批评，注意使有价值的建议迅速地实现。生产会议上有专人记录职工的建议。每次生产会议以后，车间主任召集行政和技术干部共同规定实现这些建议的期限和负责的人员。车间工会委员会和它所属的生产委员会经常检查这些建议的执行。
    为了使各个部门的职工都能够参加竞赛，党组织估计到了各人工作的特点和可能性，因此提出了按照职业展开竞赛的形式。每月奖给先进的工人、技术人员和职员以“本职业的优秀工人”“优秀的领班”“优秀的技师”“优秀的设计师”“优秀的记账员”“优秀的供给工作人员”等等称号。在生产会议总结每月工作以后，车间工会委员会评判优秀的生产组、工段、分间和职工们为竞赛优胜者。工厂工会委员会在每月十四号以前作出全厂上月竞赛总结。连续六个月取得“优秀工人”称号的竞赛优胜者，被登在光荣榜上，并且被奖给荣誉状，连续取得称号一年以上的，被载在光荣簿中并且得到专门的证书。“莫斯科人”汽车工厂已有二百多位职工获得了工业部奖给的“社会主义竞赛的优秀者”的称号。
    工厂里青年工人很多。工厂党组织非常关心青年团组织，经过它们来教育青年。工厂党委会经常听取团委会的报告，以及党组织对青年团组织的领导的报告。要求对新进厂的工人作详细的个别谈话，以便给他们具体的帮助。首先同新来工人谈话的是车间党支部书记、车间主任和团支部书记。他们还每星期和青年工人们谈工作和学习。熟练的共产党员工人自愿地带领年青新手。青年团员积极地帮助党员组织社会主义竞赛。青年中出现了许多先进人物。
    工厂有三百多个领班，他们是生产过程的基层干部，对于完成生产任务起着重大作用。党组织特别注意指导他们。很多领班参加党的教育网、领班训练班、中等技术学校和专门学院的夜校学习。一九五二年八月，工厂党委会召集了全厂领班会议，向他们报告了领班在教育工人中的作用，并且听取了他们对厂内党的工作的批评。
    “莫斯科人”汽车工厂的党组织就是这样以具体的细致的领导，保证生产任务的完成。一九五二年，工厂超额完成了生产计划，额外多制造了五百五十七辆“莫斯科人”汽车。全体职工在革新汽车、减少废品损失、提高劳动生产率、减低产品成本、超计划地节约这些方面，都完成了竞赛任务。
