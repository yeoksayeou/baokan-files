The first anniversary of the founding of the Beijing Soviet Red Cross Hospital is today. Over the past year, the Soviet Red Cross Hospital has made its utmost effort for the health cause of the Chinese people, fully demonstrating the great friendship and care of the Soviet people for the Chinese people. The Chinese people and Chinese medical and health workers express their heartfelt gratitude to the Soviet people and Soviet medical workers for this great friendship and assistance.

In just one year, the Soviet Red Cross Hospital has made great contributions to the Chinese people.

From the work achievements of the Soviet medical workers at the Beijing Soviet Red Cross Hospital, we deeply realize that Soviet medicine is advanced. Every staff member has a socialist labor attitude and a spirit of serving patients wholeheartedly. They have set a brilliant example for us. Taking the director of the Soviet Red Cross Hospital, Comrade Prokharov, as an example, on the afternoon of his arrival in Beijing last year, he immediately started working regardless of his physical fatigue, quickly corrected the shortcomings in the preparatory work, and supplemented the insufficient parts of the plan, which advanced the opening of the hospital by ten days.

There are many things worth learning from Soviet experts and Soviet medical workers. We must learn from them advanced Soviet medicine, learn Pavlov's theories, learn the Soviet medical workers' ideology and work attitude of serving patients wholeheartedly, and learn the Soviet medical workers' great patriotism and internationalism.

It is undeniable that since the founding of New China, we have learned a lot from the Soviet Union. For example, in the formulation of health work principles and policies, health organizations, as well as medical education, epidemic prevention and health care, hospital management, and even painless childbirth, tissue therapy, sleep therapy, sports therapy, and physical therapy, we have absorbed the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and gained a lot. In learning Pavlov's theories, some teaching and medical units, such as the Harbin Medical University in Northeast China, have also achieved some results. These should be affirmed. However, it should be pointed out that we are still not doing enough in learning advanced Soviet medicine and the Soviet medical workers' spirit of serving patients wholeheartedly. We have not systematically introduced new Soviet medical theories, especially Pavlov's theories. We still have bourgeois medical views in many aspects. Many of our hospital's systems are not suitable for the needs of patients. Many medical personnel still lack the concept of serving patients wholeheartedly, and the continuous occurrence of medical accidents, especially medical accidents due to negligence, is a clear example. As for the Soviet Union's advanced health supervision system, occupational health, responsibility physician system, and department director responsibility system, we are just beginning or are in the research and trial implementation stage.

It must also be pointed out that there are still some abnormal phenomena in our health and medical workers' learning from the Soviet Union today. Some people adopt a passive attitude in learning advanced Soviet medicine. They verbally say they want to learn from the Soviet Union, but there is no practical action. Some emphasize that they are busy with work and have no time to learn; others emphasize difficulties, saying that they do not understand Russian and have no way to learn. Indeed, our work is busy enough, especially those engaged in medical work are busier. However, are we so busy that we don't even have a little time to learn? In fact, this is not entirely the case. The main thing is whether you have made up your mind and are willing to work hard. If you are willing to work hard, the difficulty of not understanding Russian is not completely impossible to overcome. Now, some medical colleges and health institutions have launched Russian language learning, and after a certain period of learning, have gained the ability to read Soviet medical books. This shows that in order to learn well and truly delve into it, we must first solve the above-mentioned ideological problems. However, ideological transformation is not a matter of one morning or evening, which requires a period of arduous ideological struggle; similarly, learning from the Soviet Union will inevitably go through a period of arduous process. Marx said: "In science, there is no smooth road to travel, only those who climb the rugged paths without fear of hardship have the hope of reaching the shining peak." The medical workers of New China should take these words as their motto.

    北京苏联红十字医院成立一周年
    中央人民政府卫生部副部长  傅连暲
    今天是北京苏联红十字医院成立一周年纪念日。一年来，苏联红十字医院对中国人民的健康事业尽了最大的努力，充分表现了苏联人民对中国人民的伟大友谊和关怀。中国人民、中国医药卫生工作者，对苏联人民、苏联医务工作者的这种伟大友情和帮助表示衷心的感谢。
    在短短一年中，苏联红十字医院对中国人民的贡献是很大的。
    从北京苏联红十字医院苏联医务工作者的工作成绩中我们深深体会到：苏联医学是先进的。每一个工作人员都具有着社会主义的劳动态度和一切为病人服务的精神。他们为我们树立了光辉的榜样。以苏联红十字医院甫罗哈洛夫院长为例，去年他到北京的当天下午，不顾身体的疲劳，马上工作起来，很快地改正了筹备工作中的缺点，补充了计划中的不足部分，使医院开幕的时间提前了十天。
    苏联专家、苏联医务工作者值得我们学习的地方是很多的。我们要向他们学习苏联的先进医学，学习巴夫洛夫学说，学习苏联医务工作者的一切为了病人的思想和工作态度，学习苏联医务工作者的伟大爱国主义和国际主义精神。
    不可否认，新中国成立以来我们曾向苏联学习了不少的东西。例如在卫生工作原则、方针的制订，卫生组织机构，以及医学教育、防疫保健、医院管理，乃至无痛分娩法、组织疗法、睡眠疗法、体育疗法、物理疗法等方面，我们都吸取了苏联的先进经验，有了很多收获。在学习巴夫洛夫学说方面，某些教学和医疗单位，如东北哈尔滨医科大学，也取得了一些成绩。这些都是要肯定的。但是，应该指出，我们在学习苏联的先进医学，学习苏联医务工作者一切为病人服务的精神方面还是很不够的。我们还没有系统地介绍苏联新的医学理论，特别是巴夫洛夫学说。我们在很多方面还存在着资产阶级的医学观点。我们医院里的好多制度还不适合病人的需要。好多医务人员还缺乏一切为病人服务的观点，医院中医疗事故尤其是责任医疗事故的不断发生，便是明显的例证。至于苏联先进的卫生监督制、劳动卫生、责任医师制、科主任负责制等，我们还是刚刚开始或正在研究试行阶段。
    还必须指出，今天我们卫生医药工作者在向苏联学习方面还存在着某些不正常的现象。有些人在学习苏联先进医学方面采取消极的态度。他们口头上说要向苏联学习，但见不到实际行动。有的强调工作忙，说没有时间学；有的强调困难，说不懂俄文，无从学起。的确，我们的工作是够忙的，特别是作医疗工作的更比较忙些。但是，是不是忙得连一点学习的时间也没有呢？事实上也不完全如此。主要还是自己是否下了决心，是否肯下苦工夫。如果肯下工夫，不懂俄文的困难也不是完全不可能克服的。现在，有的医学院校和卫生机关已经展开了俄文学习，经过一定时间的学习，获得了阅读苏联医学书籍的能力。这说明要学习得好，真正能钻进去，首先必须解决上述种种思想问题。但思想改造不是一朝一夕的事，这须要经过一段艰苦的思想斗争过程；同样，学习苏联也不可避免地要经过一段艰苦过程。马克思说：“在科学上面是没有平安的大路可走的，只有那在崎岖小路的攀登上不畏劳苦的人，有希望到达光辉的顶点。”新中国的医务工作者应该把这几句话作为自己的座右铭。
