    Picasso and Peace
    USSR　Ehrenburg
       Editor's Note: The Italian art monthly "Realism" published this short essay by Ehrenburg in its issue dedicated to the Picasso Roman Exhibition. The translation published here is translated from the 465th issue of "French Literature Report" published on May 15, 1953, translated by Comrade Li Youran.
    Hundreds of books have already been written about Picasso, and there have been thousands of praises and criticisms of him. No contemporary artist seems to have aroused such intense and contradictory reactions. His paintings have long been displayed alongside the works of classical painters in museums, but every exhibition of his works immediately provokes controversy. Thousands upon thousands of painters in the old world and the new world have imitated and are imitating Picasso, but Picasso never imitates himself [Note 1]. Experts immediately and permanently determine his "period" and his "style," but every "period" and every "style" of Picasso, even every part of his work, is the origin of a new school of painting [Note 2].
    Is it necessary to mention again: how far away are these Picasso experts who bow before Picasso's name from his personality? In fact, Picasso's art is inextricably linked to his life, his fate, and his tragedy—this master was born in an era when one society was changing and another was being born.
    I do not intend to talk about Picasso's creative genius here, I just want to point out the importance of his work in my unique work as a writer. Indeed, the new things that can be found in his works are still a long way from the overall emotions that characterize the people of the new society; but I believe that everyone can see in Picasso a powerful and exceptionally sincere artist, an artist who, even if he has not ended an era, has at least independently established an artistic era.
    It was not long ago that Picasso's name was widely known to artists, writers, painting appreciators and enthusiasts, and even to those superficial people and socialites who are afraid of being left behind by the times. But today, millions of ordinary people all know Picasso's name, and his doves fly over the five continents of the world. Undoubtedly, those "appreciators" always have something to say: these lithographs [Note 3] only represent an insignificant part of Picasso's work. But to make Picasso's doves move the hearts of countless people, many things must be done first: the entire process of his artistic creation, the extraordinary proficiency of his technology, his understanding of mankind—which is also inextricably linked to his entire life—, and also the fact that an artist who has gained world honor and whose original works are greedily sought after by bankers' wives and ministers' mistresses has turned to the people. This artist has never violated the truth he respects in the realm of art, and because of his love for ordinary people, because of his love for their happiness, he despises glory, privilege and disgusting sycophants.
    This transformation of Picasso may surprise superficial people and American collectors. But this transformation drew its source from the artist's entire previous life, from his unique nature. In Picasso, all the advantages of human beings are available, he has profound national feelings; in him, there has always been this strong desire: to understand the path of history, and not to separate art from life. Some people want to use this unique special event—the Spanish people's anti-fascist struggle—to explain this transformation, thinking that it is only a superficial transformation. But I—I have the happiness of knowing Picasso for forty years, I can say with certainty: he has always been concerned about the "reality" that is despised by many artists, both worriedly and hopefully.
    Picasso's turning to the people was not sudden, not accidental: at any time he walked towards the people. However, some roads are easy to walk, with convenient transportation; and there are also spaces where there are no roads, and even no sheep trails can be found.
    Picasso has done a great job in the struggle for peace. We remember him at the Wroclaw Congress, at the Paris Congress, and at the meeting of the World Peace Council held in Rome, he participated in the work of these gatherings with a serious and honorable sense of sharpness. And whenever necessary, he lucidly criticized. He does not spare his time and body. On the contrary, he has done many things for the movement to defend peace: he conceived the image of strengthening people's unity. I saw his doves in many cities in China, in the courtyard of a small school in Leningrad, and on the chest of a Korean woman. Picasso's doves flew at the Vienna World People's Peace Congress.
    Do you believe that all this can be done? --If Picasso is not a great artist and also a great man? A fate like this can only be dreamed of by Goya, Daumier, and Courbet [Note 4].
    I remember in Rome, in the autumn of 1949, when a meeting to defend peace was held. There was a large square there, with pigeons and torches. After the meeting, we were with Picasso in a small restaurant. The workers flocked to Picasso and embraced him. He was very moved, and the workers were proud and happy. That was an amazing and unforgettable scene. That contains a profound meaning, just mentioning the simple words Roman workers, Pablo Picasso, dove of peace is enough to move everyone. At that time, I was also proud - for art.
    [Note 1] It means: he never stops, is never satisfied, never repeats, and is always breaking his own records.
    [Note 2] Picasso's painting style has undergone many changes, and can be divided into many periods, the most famous being the "Blue Period", "Circus Period", "Rose Period"... His "Cubism" can also be divided into "analytical", "synthetic", "curvilinear"... Cubism. Each of his periods is completely different, and each of his works is completely independent. Even in the same work and on the same screen, two or three different painting styles sometimes appear, almost conflicting with each other, but highly integrated. Therefore, it is said that even his "every part" is almost the "origin" or beginning of "a new school of painting", he "never imitates himself".
    [Note 3] Refers to Picasso's "Dove of Peace" which has been massively reproduced by people around the world.
    [Note 4] These three are all great painters, Goya died in 1828, Daumier died in 1879, and Courbet died in 1877. They did not live to see our most difficult and happiest era, so they can only "dream"... (Attached picture)

    毕加索与和平
    苏联　爱伦堡
       编者按：意大利绘画艺术月刊“现实主义”在献给毕加索罗马展览会的那一期上，发表了爱伦堡的这篇短文。发表在这里的译文，是从一九五三年五月十五日出版的四百六十五期“法兰西文学报”转译的，译者是李又然同志。
    已经有成百本书写毕加索，对他的赞美和批评也已经有几千种。当代艺术家似乎没有一个引起过同样激烈和同样矛盾的反应。他的画早已和古典画家的作品并排陈列在博物馆，可是他的作品的不论哪一次展览都立刻引起争论。旧的世界和新的世界的成千上万的画家模仿过并且模仿着毕加索，可是毕加索从来不模仿他自己〔注一〕。专家们一下子就永远确定他的“时期”和他的“画风”，可是毕加索的每一“时期”每一“画风”，甚至他的作品的每一部分，都是一个新的画派的发源〔注二〕。
    是否需要再一次提起：这些拜倒在毕加索名字之前的毕加索专家们离他的人品多么远？事实上，毕加索的艺术和他的生活、他的命运、他的悲剧——这位大师生在一个社会正在改变而另一个社会正在诞生的时代——不可分地联系着。
    我在这里不打算讲毕加索创造的天才，我只想指出一下他那作品在我这作家的独特的工作上的重要性。确实，从他的作品里找得到的新的东西，跟作为新社会人们特征的感情的整体，现在还有很大距离；但是我相信每个人从毕加索身上都能看见一个有力量而又异常真诚的艺术家，一个就算没有结束一个时代至少也单独建立了一个艺术时代的艺术家。
    毕加索的名字普遍地被艺术家、作家、绘画的赏识者和爱好者所认识，乃至被害怕赶不上时髦的、只看表面的人和交际家所认识，这还不是长久以前的事。但是今天，千百万普通的人全都认识了毕加索的名字，他的鸽子飞翔在世界五大洲的上空。无疑，那些“赏识者”总有话好说：这些石版印刷品〔注三〕只不过代表毕加索作品的无意义的一部分。但是要使得毕加索的鸽子感动无数万人的心，必须先做好多事情：他的艺术创造的全部进程，他所达到的技术的异常熟练，他对人类的了解——这也不可分地和他的全部生活联系着——，再就是这一事实：一个获得世界荣誉、原作被银行家太太和部长的情妇们贪婪地搜求着的艺术家转变到了人民这一边。这位艺术家从来没有违背过他在艺术范围内所尊重的真理，而由于他对普通的人们的爱，由于他对他们的幸福的爱，他鄙弃了光荣、特权和讨厌的附和者。
    毕加索的这一转变可能使只看表面的人和美国收藏家们吃惊。可是这一转变从这位艺术家以前的全部生活里，从他独有的本性里，吸取了源泉。在毕加索身上，人所有的好处全都有，他有深远的民族感情；在他身上，从来就有这一强烈的愿望：了解历史的道路，不让艺术和生活分离。有些人想用这个唯一特殊的变故——西班牙人民反法西斯斗争，来解释这一转变，认为这只是浅薄的转变。但是我——我有四十年来一直认识毕加索的幸福，我可以肯定地说：被许多艺术家所轻蔑的“现实性”，他就一直又是担忧地又是充满希望地关心着。
    毕加索转变到人民这边来，不是突然地，不是偶然地：在任何时候他都朝人民走。不过有的路容易走，交通方便；也有没有路，连条羊肠小径都找不到的空间。
    在为和平的斗争上，毕加索尽了很大的力。我们记得他在罗克劳大会上，他在巴黎大会上，他在举行于罗马的世界和平理事会的会议上，他以严肃和荣誉的锐敏的意识参加这些集会的工作。而每当有必要，他事理明达地提出批评。他不顾惜他的时间和身体。正相反，他给保卫和平的运动做了许许多多事情：他孕育了加强人民团结的形象。我在中国许多城市里看见他的鸽子，在列宁格勒一所小学的院庭里看见这鸽子，在一位朝鲜妇女的胸膛上看见这鸽子。毕加索的鸽子飞翔在维也纳世界人民和平大会上。
    你相信所有这一切都是做得到的吗？——倘若毕加索不是一个伟大的艺术家同时又是一个伟大的人？像这样一种命运，戈雅、杜米耶、古尔贝只能梦想〔注四〕。
    我记得在罗马，一九四九年秋天，那时举行保卫和平的一次会议。那里有一个大广场，有鸽子，有火把。会议之后，我们又同毕加索一起在一个小饭馆里。工人们向毕加索涌来，他们拥抱他。他十分感动，而工人们呢，骄傲而幸福。那是令人惊叹的难忘的情景。那是包含着深刻的意义的，只要提起罗马工人、巴勃罗·毕加索、和平鸽这几个简单的词，就足以感动一切人。那时我，我也骄傲的——为了艺术。
    〔注一〕意思是说：他从来不停止、不满足、不重复，总在打破他自己的记录。
    〔注二〕毕加索的画风经过好多次变化，可以划分好多个时期，最出名的如“蓝色时期”、“马戏团时期”、“玫瑰时期”……。他的“立体主义”，也可以分为“分析的”、“综合的”、“曲线的”……立体主义。他的每一时期截然不同，他的每一作品完全独立。甚至在同一作品、同一画面上有时出现两三种各不相同的画风，几乎互相冲突，可是高度地溶合。所以说甚至他的“每一部分”也几乎是“一个新的画派的发源”或起始，他“从来不模仿他自己”。
    〔注三〕按指世界人民大量复制的毕加索的“和平鸽”。
    〔注四〕按这三位都是大画家，戈雅死于一八二八年，杜米耶死于一八七九年，古尔贝死于一八七七年，都活不到我们的这个最艰苦而又最幸福的时代，所以只能“梦想”……（附图片）
