    Young Hero Wang Defu
    Zhong Gan
    Wang Defu, a delegate of the Chinese People's Volunteers to the Second National Congress of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League, a model Youth League member, and a second-class hero, is a brave and resourceful hero. He has now been promoted to platoon leader and is a glorious member of the Communist Party of China.
    In November 1951, Wang Defu's unit was blocking the enemy's advance towards Yuanshan in the Wendenli area on the eastern front. At that time, Wang Defu was the squad leader of the Ninth Squad. The Ninth Squad's position was at the forefront of the entire unit, guarding the main road to Yuanshan. On November 2nd, the enemy launched nine assaults on this position, all of which were repelled, but the Ninth Squad also sacrificed Deputy Squad Leader Ma Xiaosan and soldiers Liu Chunsheng and Shan Jinyu. The three of them died in a bunker, and Wang Defu estimated that there must be something wrong with the construction of this bunker, so he immediately rushed to this position.
    This was a machine gun emplacement, built on a protruding part of a steep slope. Obviously, the location of this fortification was inappropriate. Wang Defu jumped into the bunker to try it out, and the bunker was also dug too shallow. Standing inside, one was too exposed, and sitting down, one couldn't stretch one's legs.
    Wang Defu compared our fortifications with the enemy's fortifications for a while, and suddenly he felt as if he had been hit hard in the heart. Now everything was clear: this fortification was very poorly constructed, and because it was on a steep slope, firepower could not be brought into full play. When the enemy charged, the people in the bunker had to stand up to shoot, which made them vulnerable to enemy machine gun fire. Yesterday, Deputy Squad Leader Ma Xiaosan and the other two comrades were sacrificed in this way.
    At this time, Wang Yu, the Youth League Director of the regiment, also came to inspect the situation on the front line. After he and Wang Defu discussed how to reconstruct this fortification, he said to Wang Defu:
       "Comrade Wang Defu, you should know that the task of a Youth League member is to lead the masses to complete the task."
    The Youth League Director's words greatly inspired Wang Defu. He began to consider the situation of his squad: There were several new comrades in the Ninth Squad. Although they had a high level of awareness and great determination, they lacked combat experience. If they wanted to fight well, they had to educate them well and bring their enthusiasm into play.
    In the few days of preparing for battle, Wang Defu led everyone to rush to repair the fortifications and also seized the time to educate the new soldiers. He often gathered the new soldiers together to talk about some knowledge related to combat.
    On the morning of the 9th, the enemy's attack began. The Ninth Squad had also completed the preparations for battle early. An enemy company charged up the mountain in three directions. Wang Defu and Deputy Squad Leader Hao Yanshou studied and arranged methods to strike the enemy.
    The enemy was getting closer and closer, only ten meters away. Wang Defu shouted
    "Fire!" Hao Yanshou swung his thick arm and a grenade flew out, exploding in the enemy ranks. According to Wang Defu, this was the only way to throw grenades without wasting any. Enemies were blown up on all sides.
    The enemy's ranks were disrupted, and the survivors quickly crawled down. A burst of gunfire rang out from the Ninth Squad's fortifications, and machine gun and submachine gun bullets swept towards the enemy like a whirlwind. The enemy's covering fire also followed, and bullets splattered a burst of dirt near the fake target – the hat – that Wang Defu had placed. Wang Defu saw that the time had come and whispered, "Quickly transfer!" The soldiers quickly moved to both sides. While the enemy was still blindly firing at the hat, gunfire suddenly rang out on both sides, and grenades and hand mines also flew out, and the two enemy groups on the side were beaten back in disarray. The enemy in the middle had been cut off from their retreat by the crossfire that Wang Defu had arranged, and almost all of them were wiped out in front of the Ninth Squad's position.
    On this day, the Ninth Squad repelled seven enemy assaults, eliminated more than seventy enemies, and suffered only one minor injury, creating a record of eliminating seventy enemies for every one of their own.
    On the 14th, the Ninth Squad brought even heavier blows to the enemy. Early in the morning, a force of more than one enemy regiment gathered in front of the high ground guarded by the Ninth Squad. Then four enemy planes flew in, and seven tanks appeared on the road. Enemy heavy artillery shells also flew in from afar. The Ninth Squad's position shook in the intense explosions. A fierce battle began.
    The enemy began to attack under the cover of artillery fire. The one walking in the front was a tall officer. They walked so ostentatiously, as if they felt that after a burst of heavy bombardment, there would be no one alive here anymore. But on the position of the forward team of the Ninth Squad, ten eyes were closely watching the approaching enemy. Everyone wanted to fire several times, but Wang Defu stopped them. He knew that calmness was very important at this time. The closer the enemy was allowed to get, the more accurately and fiercely they could be hit.
    When the enemy was only eight or nine meters away from the Ninth Squad's fortifications, several grenades flew out, and machine guns and submachine guns followed; in a burst of exploding smoke, the tall officer fell down, and a large pile of enemy corpses also fell around him. Some of the remaining enemies, seeing that the situation was not good, turned around and ran, and grenades chased after them from behind.
    In this way, the Ninth Squad repelled four enemy assaults in a row.
    Under the sweeping fire of the enemy's supervisory team, the enemy launched a fifth assault. They surged up the mountain in one group, and then fell into a crossfire net. The enemy was heavily hit and retreated. Soon the enemy launched a sixth assault. The enemy rushed up the mountain under the cover of fierce artillery fire, only ten meters away from our fortifications. Wang Defu directed everyone to form a firepower and tightly press the chaotic enemy in front of the fortifications, making it impossible for them to advance or retreat. At this time, Wang Defu fired three signal flares. After a while, shells exploded in the enemy ranks, and waves of thick smoke, carrying earth and rocks and the shattered limbs of the blown-up enemy, flew into the air. Wang Defu shouted excitedly, "Well done! Well done!" Most of the enemies who rushed up the mountain were eliminated again.
    In order to seize this hilltop of more than 300 square meters, after two battalions were defeated, the enemy mobilized another battalion and a reinforced company to continue the attack. Artillery fire flew around the hilltop like a storm, and the earth and rocks in front of the Ninth Squad's position were burning fiercely. The thick smoke and flames followed the wind and swept towards the fortifications of the forward team. The fortifications were flattened by artillery fire several times, but Wang Defu led everyone to quickly repair them and continue fighting. There were more and more enemy corpses, but the Ninth Squad still suffered no casualties on the forward position.
    As the sun went down, the enemy's attacking strength gradually weakened, and they began to grab corpses under the cover of artillery fire. Wang Defu pointed to the corpse of the tall American officer not far from the position and said to the combat team leader Xiang Xingzhu: "The enemy must want to grab him back. You have to watch him and don't let them grab him away." Sure enough, as he expected, the enemy's focus was on grabbing the officer's corpse. Xiang Xingzhu was a famous sharpshooter in the whole company. He had hunted ducks at home for several years before joining the army. Now he showed his skills of hunting ducks again, and as soon as the enemy showed their heads, they were shot down by him. In this way, the enemy not only did not grab the corpse, but also left more corpses behind.
    By nine o'clock in the evening, the Ninth Squad had repelled more than twenty enemy assaults in a row, eliminating more than 400 enemies.
    After the battle, Wang Defu was honorably awarded a special merit, named a second-class hero, and honorably admitted to the Communist Party of China. The Ninth Squad, commanded by Wang Defu, set a brilliant example of defeating more with less because it fought cleverly and tenaciously, and the entire squad was collectively awarded a special merit.

    青年英雄王德福
    中干
    出席中国新民主主义青年团第二次全国代表大会的中国人民志愿军代表、模范青年团员、二级英雄王德福，是一位勇敢机智的英雄，他现在已经被提升为排长，并且已经是光荣的中国共产党党员了。
    一九五一年十一月，王德福所在的部队，在东线文登里一带阻击向元山进犯的敌人。当时王德福是九班的班长。九班的阵地是在整个部队的最前沿，它扼守着通向元山的交通要道。敌人在十一月二日向这个阵地发动了九次冲锋，都被打退了，但九班也牺牲了副班长马小三和战士刘春生、单金玉三个人。他们三人牺牲在一个工事里，王德福估计这个工事的构筑一定有毛病，于是就立刻赶到这个阵地去。
    这是一个机枪掩体，构筑在一个陡坡的突出部上，显然这个工事构筑的位置是不恰当的。王德福跳进工事里试了一下，工事挖得也太浅，站在里面就过于暴露，坐下又伸不开腿。
    王德福把我们的工事与敌人的工事对照着研究了一会，忽然心里像被什么狠狠地敲了一下，现在一切都明白了：这个工事构筑得很不好，而且是在陡坡上，火力发扬不出去，敌人冲锋时，工事里的人只好站起来射击，这样就正好受到敌人机枪火力的杀伤。昨天副班长马小三等三人，就是这样牺牲的。
    这时，团里的青年股长王玉也来检查前沿阵地的情况。他和王德福研究了应该如何改筑这个工事的问题以后，便对王德福说：
       “王德福同志，你应该知道，一个青年团员的任务是要带领群众去完成任务。”
    青年股长的话对王德福的启发很大。他开始考虑本班的情况：九班有几个新同志，他们虽然觉悟很高，决心很大，但是缺乏战斗经验，要想打好仗，就必须把他们教育好，发挥他们的积极作用。
    在准备战斗的几天里，王德福一面领导大家抢修工事，一面抓紧时间教育新战士。他常把新战士召集在一起，讲一些有关作战的知识。
    九日上午，敌人的进攻开始了。九班也早完成了战斗的准备工作。敌人一个连分成三路冲上山头。王德福和副班长郝延寿研究布置了打击敌人的办法。
    敌人越来越近，只有十多公尺了，王德福喊了声
    “打！”郝延寿的粗胳膊一抡，一颗手榴弹飞了出去，在敌人群里爆炸了。按照王德福的说法，这样打手榴弹才一点不浪费。四面都炸到敌人。
    敌人的队伍被炸乱了，活着的赶紧爬下去，九班工事里响起一片枪声，机枪、冲锋枪子弹狂风似地向敌人卷去。敌人的掩护火力也跟着扫射过来，子弹噗噗地在王德福布置的假目标——帽子附近溅起一阵泥土。王德福一看是时候了，低声喊道：“快转移！”战士们迅速转移到两侧去。当敌人还在盲目地朝着帽子射击时，两侧忽然响起枪声，手榴弹和手雷也跟着飞出来，旁边的两路敌人连滚带爬地被打回去了。而中间的一路敌人已被王德福布置的交叉火力截断了退路，他们几乎全部被消灭在九班的阵地前。
    这一天，九班打退了敌人七次冲锋，消灭了敌人七十多名，而他们自己仅一人负轻伤，创造了一比七十的歼敌纪录。
    十四日，九班给敌人带来了更沉重的打击。这天清早，敌人一个多团的兵力集结在九班扼守的高地前面。接着四架敌机飞来了，七辆坦克在大路上出现了，敌人的重炮弹也从远远的地方飞过来。九班的阵地在激烈的爆炸声里抖动起来。一场激烈的战斗开始了。
    敌人在炮火掩护下开始进攻了，走在最前面的是一个大个子军官。他们走得那么大模大样，好像觉得经过一阵猛轰之后，这里已经不会再有什么活着的人了。但是在九班前沿小组的阵地上，十只眼睛正在紧紧盯着越来越近的敌人。大家几次要打，都被王德福制止了，他知道这时候沉着是很重要的，把敌人放得越近越好，越近就越能打得准打得狠。
    当敌人离九班的工事只有八九公尺的时候，几颗手榴弹飞了出去，机枪和冲锋枪也跟着扫过去；一阵爆炸的烟雾里，大个子军官倒了下去，在他的周围也横七竖八地倒了一大堆敌人的尸体。剩下的一些敌人看势头不妙，扭头就跑，手榴弹又从他们的屁股后面追了上去。
    就这样，九班接连打退了敌人四次冲锋。
    敌人在督战队的卡宾枪扫射下，发动了第五次冲锋。他们成一路涌上山来，接着就陷在交叉火网里。敌人遭到沉重的打击之后退去了。不久敌人又发动了第六次冲锋。敌人在猛烈的炮火掩护下冲上山头，离我军工事只有十多公尺了。王德福指挥大家组成火力，把混乱的敌人紧紧压在工事前面，进退不得。这时，王德福打出了三发信号弹。住了一会，炮弹便在敌人群里爆炸起来，一阵阵的浓烟卷着土石和被炸碎的敌人的肢体，飞向半空。王德福兴奋得连连喊道：“打得好！打得好！”冲上山头的敌人大部分又被消灭了。
    敌人为了夺取这个方圆三百多公尺山头，在两个营被打垮之后，又调了一个营和一个加强连继续冲击。炮火像风暴似的在山头上飞卷着，九班阵地前面的土石都熊熊地燃烧起来，浓烟烈火顺着风势一直卷向前沿小组的工事。工事几次被炮火掀平了，但是王德福又领导大家迅速把它修好，继续战斗。敌人的尸体越来越多，而九班在前沿阵地上仍然无一伤亡。
    太阳偏西，敌人的冲击力量渐渐减弱了，他们开始在炮火的掩护下抢尸体。王德福指着离阵地不远的那个大个子美国军官的尸体对战斗小组长向兴柱说：“敌人一定是想把它抢回去，你要看住它，不要让他们抢走。”果然不出他的所料，敌人的重点是来抢这个军官的尸体。向兴柱是全连有名的神枪手，参军前他在家里打过几年水鸭子。现在他又拿出打水鸭子的本领，敌人刚一冒头就被他打倒了。这样，敌人不但没有抢走尸体，反而又丢下了更多的尸体。
    到了晚间九点钟，九班连续打退了敌人二十多次冲锋，消灭了敌人四百多名。
    战斗结束后，王德福光荣地立了特等功，被评为二级英雄，而且光荣地被吸收加入了中国共产党。王德福所指挥的第九班，由于打得机智顽强，创造了以少胜多的光辉范例，全班集体立了特等功。
