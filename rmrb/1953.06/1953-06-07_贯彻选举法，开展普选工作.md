Implement the Electoral Law and Carry Out Universal Suffrage Work

Anhui Arranges Elections While Considering Disaster Relief

The Anhui Provincial Election Committee held an election work conference on May 19th to deploy grassroots election work throughout the province. In order to accommodate the province's production and disaster relief efforts, the conference decided to carry out grassroots election work in two phases. In the Huainan and Jiangnan areas, grassroots election work will first be carried out in areas with lighter summer drought from late June to mid-August. Generally, counties can be used as units, and different types (such as mountainous areas, plains, hills, polder areas, and water areas) can be selected to complete 20% to 50% of the population under their jurisdiction first; from September 1st to the end of October, the second phase of grassroots election work will be completed. The Huaibei area will complete all preparations by the end of August, and all grassroots election work will be completed from September 1st to mid-November. The county (city) People's Congress will be held in November, and the provincial People's Congress will be held according to the time designated by the central government. The conference required that the province must complete the preparation work for grassroots elections before mid-June. County (city) election committees should be established to train cadres and organize cadres and propagandists at all levels to conduct a study of election documents. The conference emphasized in the discussion: grassroots elections must be closely integrated with production. To this end, the following four measures are proposed: (1) Call on the masses to step up production to welcome the election. Stimulate the enthusiasm of the masses for production through elections, and do a good job in both election and production work; (2) Educate all cadres participating in election work to seize the time, use the gaps, and facilitate the masses when carrying out election work. Don't tire the masses, and help the masses with production as much as possible; (3) During the election process, if there are urgent problems in production (such as flood prevention, insect catching, rice planting, harvesting, etc.), the universal suffrage work can be temporarily suspended for a few days to specifically solve urgent production problems.

Jiangxi Civil Affairs Director Proposes Specific Measures for Combining Grassroots Elections and Production

The Jiangxi Daily published an article on May 29th written by Zhu Kaiquan, Director of the Civil Affairs Department of the Provincial People's Government, entitled "How to Do a Good Job in Grassroots Election Work." The article puts forward six specific measures on the issue of combining grassroots election work with production: First, make sure not to violate the farming season or delay production. When each county decides on a plan, it must be based on the county's farming season, and the time arrangement should try to use the gaps in busy farming; each work team should also try to use the gaps to facilitate mass production when carrying out election work in the countryside. Second, streamline meetings and arrange meeting times uniformly. In general, the time spent walking and waiting for people always takes up a lot of time, so prepare well before the meeting, and some tasks do not need to be separated into several meetings. You can streamline them and combine them together, and at the same time organize everyone to arrive on time. Meetings should be held as much as possible on rainy days or in the evening, and the time should generally be within two hours (women's meetings can of course be held during the day in places where women do not work in the fields). Third, facilitate the masses. Whether it is meetings, surveys, registration, or elections, we must facilitate the masses. We would rather walk more roads ourselves than let the masses walk more roads and delay work. Fourth, uniformly deploy work. Election work cadres must cooperate to check production, mobilize the masses to actively produce, consolidate and develop mutual aid groups, conduct education on being masters of their own affairs, mobilize the masses to welcome universal suffrage by doing a good job in production, and set off a wave of production and elections; and test cadres and train candidates in production. Fifth, through elections, check the work style of cadres in leading production, and mobilize the masses to solve these problems in a democratic way. Cadres must be educated to unite the masses and do a good job in elections and production. Sixth, care about mass production and pay attention to solving urgent problems that need to be solved in production. Some comrades often neglect these problems for the sake of their own work. For example, in the period when the old and new crops are not yet harvested, we must combine election work to deeply understand, mobilize the masses to promote the spirit of mutual assistance and friendship, and distribute loans and relief grain in a timely and appropriate manner, and do a good job in unity... etc. This will not only solve the production problem, but also improve the masses' understanding of the regime and enthusiasm for elections.

Gansu Election Committee Makes Specific Regulations on Election Work in Ethnic Minority Areas

The Gansu Provincial Election Committee issued "Instructions on Grassroots Election Work" on May 27th, which focused on explaining the issue of ethnic minorities participating in elections in light of the province's specific situation. The instructions pointed out: In ethnic minority areas, whether carrying out universal suffrage or preparing for people's representative conferences, we must proceed from ethnic unity, combine with reality, and be prudent and steady, so that this work can further strengthen the unity between and within ethnic groups, and further improve the patriotic enthusiasm and revolutionary enthusiasm of the people of all ethnic groups. In ethnic minority areas where grassroots elections are not conducted, the struggle against bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of law and discipline should not be carried out. Instead, the convening of representative meetings should be combined to review the implementation of ethnic policies and ethnic work over the past three years. In the work, we must earnestly respect the languages, scripts, customs, and habits of local ethnic minorities. The working methods must be in line with the traditional habits of local ethnic groups, and the set of experiences in Han areas cannot be mechanically copied. At the same time, cadres from local ethnic groups must participate in the work and participate in leadership, and a certain number of female cadres from ethnic groups must be equipped. The selection of representatives must be carefully considered and repeatedly consulted, and the representatives of all parties must be effectively taken into account, and there must be an appropriate number of female representatives. The instructions put forward some specific regulations on how to carry out the election work of ethnic minorities throughout the province: It is determined that the elections in ethnic minority areas, except for the Tibetan areas of Xiahe, Zhuoni, Tianzhu, Subei and Lintan, and the Salar Uygur Autonomous Region and Kazakh Autonomous Region that are being established, will not conduct grassroots elections. The rest will conduct grassroots elections according to the time and steps of the local Han areas. Ethnic minority areas that do not conduct grassroots elections will not establish election committees. The local people's government should make preparations from May to July according to the specific situation, and convene representative meetings or other appropriate meetings from August to October to elect representatives through democratic consultation to convene the People's Representative Conference, and exercise the functions and powers of the People's Congress to elect representatives to attend the next higher level People's Representative Conference and representatives to attend the Provincial People's Congress. It is determined that in ethnic minority areas where grassroots elections are conducted, the population census and voter registration work shall be handled in accordance with the regulations of the central government, and the issue of voter qualifications shall be handled in accordance with the principle of Article 23 of the Central Election Committee's Answers to Several Questions Concerning Voter Qualifications. Areas where grassroots elections are not conducted will not conduct population census and voter registration, and a more accurate population statistics can be carried out by appropriately adopting methods such as self-reporting through various meetings or representatives. Ethnic minority areas that are preparing to implement regional autonomy can combine the universal suffrage if they can be combined to convene people's congresses at all levels and gradually establish autonomous regional regimes. If all work is ready, the Xihai Gu Hui Autonomous Region and the Zhangjiachuan Hui Autonomous Region can first establish autonomous regional regimes, and then establish election committees to lead the universal suffrage work. When implementing regional autonomy, the Zhangjiachuan Hui Autonomous Region should first solve the boundary issue under the leadership of the higher-level people's government; the Xihai Gu Hui Autonomous Region should solve the boundary issue after the autonomous regional regime is established. The instructions also stipulated that the county (city) and autonomous region people's governments equivalent to the county in ethnic minority areas should formulate practical and steady plans in accordance with the above regulations and in combination with local conditions.

    贯彻选举法，开展普选工作
    安徽布置选举时照顾救灾
    安徽省选举委员会在五月十九日举行了选举工作会议，布置全省基层选举工作。为了照顾该省生产救灾工作，会议确定全省基层选举工作分两期进行。淮南、江南地区，六月下旬到八月中旬先选择夏荒较轻地区进行基层选举工作，一般可以县为单位，选择不同类型（如山区、平原、丘陵、圩区、水上等），先完成所辖人口的百分之二十到百分之五十；九月一日到十月底，完成第二期基层选举工作。淮北地区在八月下旬前完成全面准备工作，九月一日到十一月中旬，全部完成基层选举工作。县（市）人民代表大会在十一月召开，省人民代表大会根据中央指定时间召开。会议要求全省在六月中旬以前必须做好基层选举准备工作。县（市）成立选举委员会，训练干部，组织各级干部和宣传员进行一次有关选举文件的学习。会议在讨论中着重指出：基层选举一定要和生产紧密结合，为此特提出如下四项办法：（一）号召群众加紧生产，迎接选举。通过选举来激发群众的生产积极性，同时做好选举和生产工作；（二）教育所有参加选举工作的干部，在进行选举工作时，要抓紧时间，利用空隙，便利群众，不要疲劳群众，并尽可能帮助群众进行生产；（三）在选举过程中，遇到生产上紧要问题时（如防汛、捕虫、栽秧、收割等），普选工作可以暂时停止几天，专门解决生产上的紧要问题。

    关于基层选举和生产结合问题江西民政厅长提出具体办法
    江西日报五月二十九日刊载了该省人民政府民政厅厅长朱开铨所写“如何做好基层选举工作”一文。文中对基层选举工作和生产相结合的问题，提出六项具体办法：第一，一定做到不违农时，不误生产。各县决定计划时必须根据本县农事季节，在时间安排上，尽量利用农忙中的空隙；各工作组在乡进行选举工作也要尽量利用空隙，便利群众生产。第二，精简会议，统一安排会议时间。一般情形，开会总是走路和等人的时间占得多，所以会前做好准备，有些工作不必分开几个会，可以精简一下，合在一起开，同时组织大家按时到会，说话简单明了。开会尽量利用雨天或晚间，时间一般应在二小时内（妇女不下田的地方当然可以在白天开妇女会）。第三，便利群众。无论开会、调查、登记、选举都要便利群众，宁可我们多走些路，不要让群众多走路，多误工。第四，统一布置工作。选举工作干部必须配合检查生产，动员群众积极生产，巩固发展互助组，进行当家作主的教育，动员群众以搞好生产来迎接普选，掀起生产和选举的热潮；并在生产中考验干部，培养候选人。第五，通过选举，检查干部在领导生产中的作风，并动员群众用民主的方式来解决这些问题，必须教育干部，团结群众，搞好选举和生产。第六，关心群众生产，注意解决生产中迫切要求解决的问题。有的同志往往为了本身工作，忽视这些问题，比如在青黄不接时，必须结合选举工作深入了解，动员群众发扬互助友爱精神，并将贷款及救济粮款及时适当发放，搞好团结……等。这就不但解决了生产问题，同时也可以提高群众对于政权的认识与选举的热情。
