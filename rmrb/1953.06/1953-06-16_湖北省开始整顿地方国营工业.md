Hubei Province Begins Rectifying Local State-Owned Industry

Various regions in Hubei Province have begun to rectify local state-owned industries.

In the past, Hubei Province's local state-owned industries achieved significant results in supplementing the deficiencies of state-owned industries and meeting the production and living needs of the broad masses of urban and rural workers. However, according to recent investigations in various regions, there are also many serious problems.

First, there is a great deal of blindness in operation. This is primarily manifested in inappropriate factory site selection. For example, the Zhongxiang County Machinery and Electric Oil Factory used a steam engine but was built in an area with no nearby water source and inconvenient transportation. It has been losing money since it opened and is currently unsustainable. The Public Security County Flour Mill only started operating in October 1952 and is now shut down awaiting materials. Secondly, blindness is also manifested in blindly producing without regard to social needs, resulting in serious stockpiling of finished products. For example, the Xiangyang Ebei Machinery Factory has 110 seven-inch plows stockpiled in the factory, requiring modification. Counties also have 420 stockpiled; semi-finished products can still make 346 more, and parts can make over 200 more. The Jiangling Cotton Weaving Factory has over 2,000 bolts of cloth stockpiled, worth over 300 million yuan in capital. Many factories can only turn over their capital once a year.

Second, production costs are high, quality is poor, and waste is serious. For example, the Xiaogan Special District Farm Implement Factory charged 20,200 yuan for a ground screw nut for the Yunmeng Electric Oil Rice Factory, while the market price was only 4,000 yuan. The new-style plow produced by the factory is of poor quality. Farmers bought it but could not use it and hung it on the wall. Farmers said: "The old plow tills the field, the foreign plow is for show," and called this plow a "hanging plow." The factory manufactured 1,100 seven-inch plows, but only sold 200; most of those sold were stored in cooperatives, trade companies, and township farmer associations, with only a small number in the hands of farmers. The factory lost 41 million yuan in the first quarter of this year alone.

Third, production management is chaotic, no one is responsible, the organizational structure is bloated, there are too many non-production personnel, and there is a lack of economic accounting thinking. Taking the Xiaogan Special District Farm Implement Factory as an example, workers reported that the factory used to have "eight many and three few": many managers, many cadres, many people in charge, many people sitting at desks, many stamps, many forms, many procedures, many layers; few going to the workshop, few engaging in business, few taking responsibility. It takes eleven procedures to receive a screw nut; a worker's loan repayment over twelve months requires 197 procedures, and this method is said to be "standardized" and "new." The Xiaogan Farm Implement Factory has not established a management system for allocating and determining materials, so the phenomenon of using large materials for small purposes, using whole materials for parts, and using good materials for inferior purposes is also very serious. For example, the Jingzhou Power Plant only has eight workers but thirteen staff members. The Jiangling Cotton Weaving Factory uses handicraft production but adopts the organizational structure of modern industry. The internal organization includes a sales section, an accounting section, a material section, a storage section, a medical room, personnel, security, clerical work, receiving and dispatching, and communications, employing twenty-six staff members.

In addition, abnormal relations between the trade union and the administration, the administration not relying on workers, the trade union's unclear production viewpoint, and unreasonable wages are also widespread.

After learning about this situation, the Urban Work Department of the Hubei Provincial Party Committee issued instructions in early April to rectify local state-owned industries and sent a working group to the Xiaogan Special District to provide specific assistance. The Provincial Department of Industry also sent working groups to six special districts to understand the situation and assist various regions in formulating rectification plans. After in-depth investigation and understanding of the situation, most special counties have formulated preliminary rectification plans, and a few regions have completed rectification; however, the leading cadres of factories in some regions still do not understand the role of local industry in national economic construction and mistakenly believe that: "The national large-scale economic construction has begun, and local industry has no future." After in-depth inspection and discovery of many problems, the irresponsible idea of ​​"closing down" arose. This is extremely wrong. (Chen Fan)

### 湖北省开始整顿地方国营工业

    湖北省开始整顿地方国营工业
    湖北省各地已开始整顿地方国营工业。
    湖北省地方国营工业，过去在补助国营工业不足和满足广大城乡劳动人民生产、生活的需要方面，有很大的成绩；但根据各地最近了解的情况来看，也存在着不少严重的问题。
    第一，经营的盲目性很大。这首先表现在厂址选择不当。如锺祥县机器电油厂使用蒸汽机，却把工厂建在一个附近无水的地区，交通又不方便，开厂以来就赔本，目前已经无法维持。公安县面粉厂一九五二年十月才开工，现在就已经停工待料。其次，盲目性还表现在不根据社会需要盲目生产，造成成品的严重积压现象。如襄阳鄂北机械厂制造的七寸步犁，厂内就积压一百一十部，需要另行改装；各县还积压四百二十部；半成品还能做出三百四十六部，零品还可做二百多部。江陵棉织厂积压布匹二千多匹，合资金三亿多元。还有好多厂，一年中资金只能周转一次。
    第二，生产成本高，质量差，浪费现象严重。如孝感专区农具厂给云梦电油米厂打地螺丝帽，一个合二万零二百元，而市价才四千元。该厂生产的新式步犁质量差，农民买了不能用而把它挂在墙上。农民们说：土犁耕田，洋犁参观；并称这种犁是
    “挂犁”。该厂制造了一千一百部七寸步犁，只卖出去二百部；卖出去的也大多放在合作社、贸易公司及乡农会，只有很少数是在农民手里。该厂只在今年第一季度就亏损四千一百万元。
    第三，生产管理混乱，无人负责，组织机构庞大，非生产人员过多，缺乏经济核算思想。以孝感专区农具厂为例，工人反映厂内过去有“八多三少”，即：经理多，干部多，当家的人多，坐办公桌的多，盖章多，表格多，手续多，层次多；下车间的少，搞业务的少，负责的少。领做一个螺丝帽要经过十一道手续；一个工人借款分十二个月扣还，须经过一百九十七道手续，还说这种办法是“正规化”、“新东西”。孝感农具厂并没有制定配料定料的管理制度，所以大材小用、整材零用、好材劣用的现象也很严重。又如荆州发电厂只有八个工人，职员却有十三个。江陵棉织厂系手工业生产，竟采用近代工业的组织机构，内部组织有营业股、会计股、材料股、保管股、医务室、人事、保卫、文书、收发、传达等，用了二十六个职员。
    此外，工会与行政关系不正常，行政不依靠工人，工会生产观点不明确及工资不合理等现象，也很普遍。
    中共湖北省委城工部了解到这种情况后，在四月上旬发出了整顿地方国营工业的指示，并派出工作组到孝感专区进行具体帮助，省工业厅也分别派出工作组到六个专区了解情况，协助各地订立整顿方案和计划。各专县在深入摸底、了解情况后，大部都订出了初步的整顿计划，有少数地区已经整顿完毕；但有些地区的工厂领导干部却还不了解地方工业在国家经济建设中的作用，错误地认为：“国家大规模经济建设开始了，地方工业没有前途了。”在深入检查、发现了很多问题以后，就产生“干脆关门算了”的不负责任的“丢滥摊子”的思想，这是十分错误的。    （陈帆）
