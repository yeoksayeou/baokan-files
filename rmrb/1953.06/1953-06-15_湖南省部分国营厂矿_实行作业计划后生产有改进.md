Xinhua News Agency report:

Some state-owned factories and mines in Hunan Province, including the Hunan Province Xikuangshan Mining Bureau, Zhongnan Electrical Factory, the First Zinc Smelting Plant of Shuikoushan Mining Bureau, Zhuzhou Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Plant, and the First and Fourth Power Plants of Xiangzhong Electric Power Bureau, all mobilized their workers in April and May to discuss production plans and, on this basis, formulated operational plans. In the formulation of operational plans, the leaders of each factory and mine relied on the masses to tap the potential of the enterprise, so that the operational plans were generally more advanced and practical. For example, when formulating the operational plan, the Xikuangshan Mining Bureau organized technicians and workers to conduct mass rock identification, carefully studying the hardness of the rock, the size of the ore, the geological trend, slope, specifications, and mining methods of each mine face and roadway, and accurately determined various quotas and indicators. The First Power Plant of Xiangzhong Electric Power Bureau focused on the key issue of safe power generation and mobilized its workers to find shortcuts. As a result, the workers put forward 117 rationalization proposals, which increased all quotas compared to the original plan.

The implementation of operational plans in these factories and mines has greatly improved the production situation. For example, the Xikuangshan Mining Bureau had poor plan completion in the first quarter, but in April, due to the implementation of the operational plan, it basically completed the production plan, and in May, all products exceeded the plan. The First Zinc Smelting Plant of Shuikoushan Mining Bureau and the Fourth Power Plant of Xiangzhong Electric Power Bureau have also been able to complete the production plan on a relatively balanced monthly basis. The lathe team of the transformer workshop of Zhongnan Electrical Factory had failed to complete the plan for four consecutive months, but from May onwards, this team has been able to overfulfill the production plan on a daily basis.

    湖南省部分国营厂矿
    实行作业计划后生产有改进
    湖南省锡矿山矿务局、中南电工厂、水口山矿务局第一炼锌厂、株州机车车辆修理厂和湘中电业局第一和第四发电厂等国营厂、矿在四、五月份都发动职工讨论了生产计划，并在这一基础上制订了作业计划。在制订作业计划中，各厂、矿领导上依靠群众挖掘企业潜在能力，使作业计划一般都订得比较先进和切合实际。如锡矿山矿务局在制订作业计划时，组织技术人员和工人进行群众性的鑑头鉴定，把每一个壋头和巷道的岩石软硬、出山大小、地层走向、坡度、规格及开采方法等，都加以仔细研究，比较准确地订出各项定额和指标。湘中电业局第一发电厂由于抓紧了安全发电这一关键问题来发动职工找窍门，结果职工们提出了一百十七条合理化建议，使各项定额都比原计划提高了。
    这些厂矿在实行作业计划后，已使生产情况大大改善。如锡矿山矿务局第一季度完成计划较差，四月份由于实行作业计划，已经基本上完成了生产计划，五月份则全部产品都超额完成了计划。水口山矿务局第一炼锌厂和湘中电业局第四发电厂也已能按月较均衡地完成生产计划。中南电工厂变压器车间的车工班，曾经连续四个月未完成计划，但从五月份起，这个班已能按日超额完成生产计划。
