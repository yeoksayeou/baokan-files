    Build Our Motherland into Something Even More Beautiful
    Representative of the Second National Congress of the All-China Youth Federation
    National Railway Labor Model
    Yang Maolin
    After listening to the reports and speeches of the leading comrades and representatives at the Second National Congress of the All-China Youth Federation, I have a clearer understanding that Chinese youth can only have happiness and a bright future under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao.
    I am an ordinary worker. In the past, we were looked down upon and suffered all kinds of torment in the old society. After liberation, we became masters of the new society. Chairman Mao brought us good days, and the years of suffering are gone forever.
    In 1948, I joined the people's railway freight transport work. At that time, I was very unfamiliar with this work, but I often remembered what the Party taught me: "We are now the masters of the country, and we must cherish every piece of goods of our country. If there is any loss to the goods transported through our hands, it is our own loss." So I always tried to find ways to do my job well. In my work, Soviet experts were my best teachers, patiently and kindly guiding me to learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union. For example, when promoting the "Goods Guarantee Note," Soviet expert Comrade Radavsky said to me: "Comrade Yang Maolin, don't regard the Goods Guarantee Note as the value of a piece of paper, you should regard it as the value of a carload of goods." So I actively studied and overcame various difficulties to implement it. When implementing the "Goods Guarantee Note," some workers were afraid of trouble and afraid of signing the guarantee note, because they would be responsible if an accident occurred. Therefore, in response to these situations, I patiently conducted propaganda and education for everyone, telling everyone what the Party taught me, and I set an example for everyone with the support of the leadership. In this way, everyone gradually mastered this method. In order to ensure the implementation of this advanced work method, I also established six simple and easy-to-implement systems according to the operation process. After our group implemented these advanced methods, labor efficiency was greatly improved. What used to require 600 wagons to load goods now only requires 250 wagons; the loading capacity of less-than-carload freight has also increased from 15.5 tons to 23 tons; the loading capacity of less-than-carload cars along the way has also increased from 4.5 tons to 15.6 tons. In this way, in the Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement in 1951 alone, we increased production by 2.4 billion yuan for the country.
    After the vigorous movement to Resist America and Aid Korea unfolded, I signed up to participate in the work on the Korean front; but because the work situation at that time still required me to stay in my original post, the leadership did not approve my request. At that time, I felt very uneasy. Later, I thought that if I could load one more ton of goods on each car in my work, it would add a share of strength to Resist America and Aid Korea and to the construction of the motherland. So I decided to double my efforts to study my business, and as a result, with the help of Soviet expert Comrade Shakragov, I created new work methods such as the "Matching Number Delivery Method" and the "Packaging Classification Stacking Method." These methods solved the long-standing contradictions in the past in station shunting, delivery, and loading and unloading work, and combined these tasks into a whole, eliminating unreasonable phenomena. The Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government summarized these advanced methods and called them the "Yang Maolin Loading Method." The characteristics of this method are that it loads more, loads faster, and loads more stably. "More" means giving full play to the carrying capacity of the wagon, "faster" means shortening the operation time and speeding up the turnover of vehicles, and "stable" means safely and completely transporting goods. The result of promoting this method at Harbin Station has achieved great success and has played a good role in the national railway "full load, super axle, 500 kilometers" movement, and has been supported by the majority of employees. On the basis of this method, everyone worked hard to tap potential, find tricks, and create 350 kinds of advanced methods for loading goods and six kinds of car loading methods, saving the country more than 100,000 wagons in 1952 alone, promoting the continuous advancement of national railway business work. After Chairman Mao put forward the three major tasks this year, our group actively responded to the call, and labor efficiency has been even higher.
    Five years ago, I was just an ordinary young worker, and now I am the assistant stationmaster of Harbin Station. I deeply feel that my achievements and glory should be attributed to the education and cultivation of me by the Party and Chairman Mao, to the selfless guidance and help of Soviet experts, and to the efforts of the majority of employees. Young friends, at this time when our motherland is entering a new construction phase, I guarantee to implement the resolutions and spirit of the Second National Congress of the All-China Youth Federation, with an attitude of neither arrogance nor impetuosity, to further learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, rely on the majority of employees in my work, and make greater achievements on the basis of the original achievements, complete or overfulfill the tasks assigned to me by the state, and build our motherland into something even more beautiful!

### 把我们的祖国建设得更美好

    把我们的祖国建设得更美好
    中华全国青年第二次代表大会代表
    全国铁路劳动模范
    杨茂林
    我在中华全国青年第二次代表大会上听了领导同志和代表们的报告和发言以后，更加清楚地认识到：中国青年只有在共产党和毛主席的领导下才有幸福和远大的前途。
    我是一个普通的工人。在过去我们是被人看不起的人，受尽了旧社会的折磨。解放以后，我们成了新社会的主人。毛主席给我们带来了好日子，受苦受难的年月是一去不返了。
    一九四八年我参加了人民铁路的货物运送工作。当时我对这一工作是很生疏的，但是我经常想起党教导我的话：“我们现在是国家的主人了，要爱护我们国家的每一件货物，凡是经过我们的手运输的货物，如果有了一点损失，也就是我们自己的损失。”所以我总是想各种办法来把自己的工作搞好。在工作中，苏联专家是我最好的老师，他们耐心地亲切地指导我学习苏联的先进经验。像在推广“货物保证笺”时，苏联专家拉达夫斯基同志对我说：“杨茂林同志，你不要把货物保证笺看成是一张纸的价值，应当把它看成是一车货的价值。”我便积极地学习，克服各种困难来贯彻它。在执行“货物保证笺”时，有的工友怕麻烦，怕在保证笺上签名，因为出了事故就要负责任。于是，我针对这些情况，耐心地向大家进行宣传教育，把党教导我的话告诉大家，并且我在领导方面的支持下作榜样给大家看。这样，大家渐渐地掌握了这个方法。为了保证贯彻这一先进工作法，我又按着作业的过程建立了简单易行的六种制度。我们小组在实行了这些先进方法以后，劳动效率大大地提高了，过去要用六百个车皮装的货，现在仅用二百五十个车皮就行了；零装货物的装载量也由十五点五吨提高到二十三吨；沿途零担车的装载量也由四点五吨提高到十五点六吨。这样，仅在一九五一年增产节约运动中，就给国家增产了二十四亿元。
    轰轰烈烈的抗美援朝运动展开以后，我曾报名要求参加朝鲜前线的工作；但是因为当时的工作情况还需要我留在原来的岗位上，领导方面没有批准我的请求。当时我心里很不安。后来，我想如果在自己的工作岗位上能使每辆车多装一吨货，也就是给抗美援朝、给祖国建设增添了一分力量。于是我决心加倍努力钻研业务，结果，在苏联专家沙克拉果夫同志的帮助下，我创造了“对号取送车法”、“包装分类码垛法”等新的工作方法，这些方法解决了过去车站调车、取送车、装卸车工作中长期存在的矛盾，把这些工作结合成一个整体，消灭了不合理的现象。中央人民政府铁道部把这些先进的方法总结起来，称为“杨茂林装车法”。这个方法的特点是装的多，装的快，装的稳。“多”，就是充分发挥车皮的载重量，“快”，就是缩短作业时间，加快车辆的周转，“稳”，就是安全地完整地运送货物。这个方法在哈尔滨站推行的结果，得到了很大成绩，并在全国铁路“满载，超轴，五百公里”运动中发挥了良好作用，得到了广大员工的拥护和支持。在这一方法的基础上，大家努力挖潜力，找窍门，创造了三百五十种先进的装载货物的方法和六种装车法，仅在一九五二年就给国家节省了上十万辆车皮，推动了全国铁路商务工作的不断前进。在今年毛主席提出三大任务后，我们小组积极响应了号召，劳动效率更高了。
    五年前我还是一个普通的青年工人，现在我是哈尔滨站货物助理站长。我深深地感到，我的这些成绩和光荣，都应该归功于党和毛主席对我的教育和培养，归功于苏联专家们大公无私的指导和帮助，归功于广大员工们的努力。青年朋友们，在目前我们祖国进入新的建设的时候，我保证贯彻中华全国青年第二次代表大会的决议和精神，以不骄不躁的态度，进一步学习苏联先进经验，在工作中依靠广大员工，在原有成绩的基础上作出更大的成绩，完成或超额完成国家给我的任务，把我们的祖国建设得更美好！
