The Wuhan Municipal People's Government has made a decision on the He Hengfu case.

He Hengfu formerly held the positions of Member of the Central-South Military and Administrative Committee, Member of the Central-South Financial and Economic Committee, Member of the Wuhan Municipal People's Government, Member of the Wuhan Municipal Consultative Committee, and Chairman of the Preparatory Committee of the Wuhan Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce. The people entrusted him with these important positions in the hope that he could represent the national bourgeoisie in participating in the state power, represent the legitimate interests of private industrialists and businessmen within the scope of the Common Program, and unite and educate private industrialists and businessmen to actively engage in proper operations beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood. However, the reality was quite the opposite; not only did he fail to act in accordance with the people's expectations, but he also betrayed the expectations of the broad masses of the people, especially the industrialists and businessmen of Wuhan. He used the various important positions he held in the government and the position of Chairman of the Preparatory Committee of the Federation of Industry and Commerce to assist and instigate the "five evils" of illegal capitalists in various ways, and carried out activities to sabotage the country.

During the "Five-Antis" movement, He Hengfu not only did not actively participate, but resisted and sabotaged the movement, preventing others from confessing, causing some unscrupulous merchants to stubbornly resist the "Five-Antis" movement, which aroused great anger and dissatisfaction among the broad masses. Industrial and commercial circles and the vast number of workers and staff members reported and exposed He Hengfu's ugly face and illegal acts such as undermining government decrees. The Federation of Industry and Commerce immediately removed him from the position of Chairman of the Preparatory Committee, and the Central-South Military and Administrative Committee, based on the situation at the time and in response to the demands of the broad masses and industrial and commercial circles, requested the approval of the Central People's Government's Government Administration Council to remove him from all positions he held in the People's Government and arrest him for legal action to appease public anger.

In order to carefully verify the case, the People's Government immediately established a special task force, which adopted a realistic approach to verify the materials reported by the masses in various ways, repeatedly studied them, and conducted a comprehensive and in-depth investigation and analysis in order to verify and finalize the case. After a long and meticulous investigation, apart from some capitalists' confessions and a portion of the individual workers' and staff members' reports being too exaggerated and having been removed, and a portion still lacking sufficient evidence, his crimes were still serious.

In order to achieve the purpose of stealing and swindling state property, He Hengfu, within the Qianchang Trading Company, which he directly managed, successively bribed 19 cadres from 10 state organs with RMB 17,296,000. He bribed a single cadre of the Hubei Provincial Trading Company with as much as RMB 4,700,000. Secondly, he used various despicable means to evade and underpay national taxes totaling RMB 397,170,000. Thirdly, in transactions with state-owned enterprises involving tung oil, he deceived the state and stole and swindled property totaling RMB 146,003,920.

During his tenure as a member of the Central-South Military and Administrative Committee and a member of the Central-South Financial and Economic Committee, He Hengfu took back 12 confidential documents issued to him for reference and stipulated to be returned within a limited time, including: "Summary of the Five Major Industries in the Central-South Region: Textiles, Cigarettes, Coal, Matches, and Oil Extraction, Production and Sales Plan for the Second Half of 1950" and "Grain Production and Sales Situation and Adjustment Measures in the Central-South Region," and mobilized many people to copy them overnight, seriously leaking state secrets. He also leaked the confidential documents of the Central-South Region Timber Conference on the unified allocation plan for timber to the Hanyang Bamboo and Timber Industry, causing timber merchants to rush to Hunan to purchase timber, resulting in a chaotic phenomenon of soaring timber prices in the production area, causing losses to state property.

He Hengfu's illegal crimes of bribing cadres, evading and underpaying taxes, leaking state secrets, stealing and swindling state property, and resisting and sabotaging the "Five-Antis" are extremely serious. However, because he was able to lower his head and admit his guilt and express remorse during his detention, the Wuhan Municipal People's Government, adhering to the spirit of combining strictness and leniency, has specially given him lenient treatment. It has already requested the approval of the Central People's Government's Government Administration Council to remove He Hengfu from all positions he held in the People's Government and, according to the standards and methods for classifying and handling industrial and commercial households in the "Five-Antis" movement, determined him to be a completely illegal household; however, he is exempt from criminal punishment and released from the date of the judgment.

    武汉市人民政府对贺衡夫案作出处分决定
    武汉市人民政府对贺衡夫案已作出处分决定。
    贺衡夫原任中南军政委员会委员、中南财政经济委员会委员、武汉市人民政府委员、武汉市协商委员会委员、武汉市工商业联合会筹备委员会主任委员。人民之所以把这些重要职位给他，是希望他能代表民族资产阶级参加国家政权，在共同纲领的范围内，代表私营工商业者的合法利益，团结教育私营工商业者积极地进行有利国计民生的正当经营。然而事实恰恰相反，他不但没有遵照人民对他的期望办事，反而违背了广大人民，特别是武汉市工商业者对他的期望。他利用自己在政府中所担任的各种重要职务以及工商业联合会筹委会主任委员的职务，多方助长和指使不法资本家的“五毒”行为，进行对国家的破坏活动。
    “五反”运动中，贺衡夫不但不积极参加，反而抗拒破坏，阻止别人坦白，造成某些奸商们对“五反”运动的顽抗，因而引起广大群众的极大愤怒与不满。工商界及广大职工对贺衡夫的丑恶面貌和破坏政府法令等违法行为，纷纷检举与揭发。工商联当即撤销其筹备委员会主任委员的职务，中南军政委员会亦根据当时情况接受广大群众和工商界的要求，呈请中央人民政府政务院批准，撤销其在人民政府所担任的一切职务，并逮捕法办，以平民愤。
    人民政府为了慎重地查实此案，随即成立了专案小组，以实事求是的态度，对群众检举之材料，多方查对，反复研究，进行全面深入的调查分析，以求核实定案。经过长期缜密查究结果，除有些资本家坦白材料和个别职工的检举材料一部分过于夸大，已予剔除，一部分尚嫌罪证不足外，其罪行仍是严重的。
    贺衡夫为达到盗骗国家资财的目的，在其直接经营之乾昌贸易行内，即曾先后以人民币一千七百二十九万六千元，向国家的十个机关的十九个干部进行贿赂。仅对湖北省贸易公司干部一人，即行贿达四百七十万元。其次用各种卑鄙手段，偷漏国税计人民币三亿九千七百一十七万元。再次，在与国营企业进行桐油的交易中，蒙蔽国家，盗骗资财计人民币一亿四千六百另三万九千三百二十元。
    贺衡夫在中南军政委员会委员及中南财经委员会委员任内，拿回发给他参考的、规定限期收回的机密文件：“中南区纺织、卷烟、煤炭、火柴、榨油，五大事业概要，一九五○年下半年产销计划”和“中南区粮食产销情况及调剂办法”等十二份，动员多人连夜抄写，严重地泄漏了国家机密。他又把中南区木材会议关于木材统一调配计划的机密文件，泄露给汉阳竹木业，因此木材商到湖南去抢购，造成产地木材暴涨的混乱现象，使国家财产遭受损失。
    贺衡夫行贿干部、偷漏税收、泄露国家机密、盗骗国家财产、抗拒破坏“五反”等等违法罪行是极端严重的。但因其在被押期间尚能低头认罪，表示悔过，武汉市人民政府仍本严肃与宽大相结合的精神，特予从宽处理，已经呈请中央人民政府政务院批准，撤销贺衡夫在人民政府中所担任之一切职务，并根据在“五反”运动中关于工商户分类处理的标准和办法，判定其为完全违法户；但免予刑事处分，并自判定之日起释放。
