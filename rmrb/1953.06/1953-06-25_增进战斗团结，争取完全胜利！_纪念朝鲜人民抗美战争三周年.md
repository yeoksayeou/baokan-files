    Increase Combat Solidarity and Strive for Complete Victory!
    —Commemorating the Third Anniversary of the Korean People's War Against America
    Deng Hua, Deputy Commander of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army
    On the occasion of the third anniversary of the "June 25th" Korean People's War Against America, the hope for the realization of the Korean armistice is closer than ever before. As long as the US side can make satisfactory responses, handling, and guarantees to the demands put forward in the June 19th letter from Marshal Kim Il-sung and General Peng Dehuai, then the Korean armistice agreement, which the people of the world have been longing for, can be signed and implemented, thereby opening the way for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. There is no doubt that this is the result of the combat victory of the Korean and Chinese People's Armies, and the result of the victory of the world peace movement. All commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, with extremely joyous and encouraging hearts, together with the beloved Korean people and the fraternal Korean People's Army, celebrate the great victory that has been achieved; celebrate the growing, consolidated, and fraternal solidarity that has grown in our battles; and celebrate the eternal victory of the cause of the Korean and Chinese people in defending their motherland and world peace.
    On June 25, 1950, the heroic Korean people, under the wise leadership of Marshal Kim Il-sung, bravely began to resist the war of aggression launched by the American aggressors, and it has now been three years. On October 25, 1950, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army carried out the sacred mission of resisting America and aiding Korea to protect our homes and defend our country, and fought side by side with the Korean people and the Korean People's Army, and it has now been two years and eight months. This is a long-term and arduous battle. In this long-term and arduous battle, the Korean and Chinese People's Forces have achieved the victory of annihilating more than 980,000 enemy soldiers, seizing and consuming a large amount of enemy materials and equipment, thwarting countless vigorous attacks by the enemy, and blocking the enemy near the 38th parallel. At the same time, the Korean and Chinese People's Forces have also captured enemy positions in constantly held victorious counterattacks, pushing the front line further south day by day.
    The victory of the Korean and Chinese People's Forces is of extremely important historical and world significance. We do not intend to discuss in detail here how the war in the past three years has taught the imperialist aggressors a lesson, because this lesson has been seen and almost unanimously acknowledged by the whole world. The most important political consequence of the Korean War in the past three years, I believe, is that it has proved the irresistibility of the forces of peace. Although the enemies of peace, because they fear peace, have tried every means to prevent the realization of peace, and are still using all kinds of despicable conspiracies to undermine the hope for peace, it is not difficult to see how isolated and embarrassed these enemies of peace are in the face of world public opinion. The victory of the Korean and Chinese people and the agreement on the issue of prisoner of war repatriation show that only international peaceful negotiation is the only way to resolve current international disputes and ease the current international situation. Whoever insists on a war of aggression can only end up like MacArthur and Syngman Rhee. The current frantic clamor and frantic behavior of Syngman Rhee and his backers clearly explain to the world the question of who is responsible for the war and to whom justice belongs. The people of all countries who once stood on the side of Syngman Rhee can now understand more easily than in the past: who they supported; what they shed blood to support such a vicious warmongering group for; and what flame of justice made the Korean and Chinese people so heroic in this life-and-death struggle.
    In any case, the Syngman Rhee incident tells us a truth: the enemies of peace still have considerable power, and they are unwilling to accept peace easily. There have been such lessons in history: The Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, under the direction and support of US imperialism, twice tore up the agreements signed with the Chinese Communist Party and launched large-scale offensives against the then Chinese Liberated Areas; the Hitler bandit gang also tore up the German-Soviet Non-Aggression Treaty and launched a surprise attack on the Soviet Union. Therefore, in commemorating the third anniversary of the Korean People's Anti-Aggression War on "June 25," in addition to celebrating the victory that has been achieved with extremely joyous and encouraging hearts, we cannot but pay attention to the development of the situation with an extremely serious attitude, and, together with our fraternal Korean People's Army, continue to struggle more vigilantly, and strive to realize the Korean armistice, to realize the repatriation of prisoners of war in accordance with the agreement after the armistice, for a stable armistice, and for the final peaceful resolution of the Korean issue.
    Looking back at the great victories achieved by the Korean and Chinese people in the war against America in the past three years, it cannot be forgotten that this is inseparable from the high degree of combat solidarity between the Korean and Chinese people, and between the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. This kind of unity is built on the basis of the common lofty goal of defending peace and defending national independence and security, is linked by the great idea of internationalism, and is solidified with flesh and blood in the long-term and arduous struggle. The war of aggression launched by the American aggressors three years ago not only attempted to enslave the Korean people, but also attempted to further attack the Chinese mainland and follow the old path of the Japanese aggressors. Since then, the Chinese people have closely linked the task of defending and building their motherland with the task of supporting the heroic Korean people's anti-aggression struggle. Especially since the Chinese People's Volunteer Army entered Korea to fight, fighting side by side with the heroic Korean People's Army, caring for each other, supporting each other, loving each other, and learning from each other, the combat friendship and unity of the Korean and Chinese people has developed in an extremely moving way. The emergence of countless figures like Luo Shengjiao and Park Jae-geun is a sign of the further growth of this high internationalist friendship and unity between the people of fraternal countries, which will be passed down for thousands of years. With this high degree of consolidated and combat unity, we can be invincible. We have already defeated enemies with superior equipment than us in this unity; shattered all kinds of vile provocations by the enemy; overcome various difficulties during the war, and achieved such a great victory today. In the future, we must work harder to consolidate and enhance this unity. The Chinese People's Volunteer Army must more resolutely implement all the policies and decrees of the Korean government, deeply cherish every mountain, river, tree, and blade of grass in Korea, support Marshal Kim Il-sung, the leader of the Korean people, support the Korean Workers' Party, support the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, learn more humbly from the heroic Korean people and the Korean People's Army, strictly abide by discipline, and do everything possible to help the fraternal Korean people work together to continuously strive to further enhance the unity and friendship between the Korean and Chinese people and armies. It is deeply believed that the further strengthening of this unity will surely guarantee that in the continued arduous struggle, it will lead the Korean and Chinese people to the complete victory of the common cause against US imperialist aggression!
    Long live the consolidated combat friendship and unity forged in blood between the people of Korea and China!
    Eternal glory to the martyrs who gloriously sacrificed themselves in the great war against America!
    Long live the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and its great leader Marshal Kim Il-sung!
    Long live Chairman Mao Zedong, the great leader of the Chinese people!

    增进战斗团结，争取完全胜利！
    ——纪念朝鲜人民抗美战争三周年
    中国人民志愿军副司令员  邓华
    在“六·二五”朝鲜人民抗美战争三周年纪念日的时候，朝鲜停战实现的希望已经比过去任何时候都近了。只要美国方面对于金日成元帅和彭德怀将军六月十九日信件中所提出的要求能够作出令人满意的答复、处理和保证，那么，全世界人民所盼望的朝鲜停战协定，就有可能签订和实施，从而就会打开和平解决朝鲜问题的道路。毫无疑问，这是朝中人民军队战斗胜利的结果，这是世界和平运动胜利的结果。中国人民志愿军全体指挥员、战斗员以极其欢欣鼓舞的心情，和亲爱的朝鲜人民在一起，和兄弟的朝鲜人民军在一起，庆祝已经取得的伟大的胜利；庆祝我们在战斗中日益增长起来的、巩固的、兄弟般的团结；庆祝朝中人民保卫祖国和世界和平的事业永远胜利。
    一九五零年六月二十五日，英雄的朝鲜人民在金日成元帅的英明领导下，英勇地开始反抗美国侵略者所发动的侵略战争，到现在已经三年了。一九五零年十月二十五日，中国人民志愿军执行抗美援朝保家卫国的神圣任务，与朝鲜人民和朝鲜人民军并肩作战，到现在也已经两年零八个月了。这是一个长期的、艰巨的战斗。在这个长期的艰巨的战斗当中，朝中人民部队取得了歼灭敌人九十八万多人的胜利，缴获与损耗了敌人大量的物资和装备，粉碎了敌人无数次的大力进攻，把敌人阻挡在三八线的附近。同时，朝中人民部队还在不断举行的胜利的反击战中夺取了敌人的阵地，把战线日益推向南方。
    朝中人民部队的胜利是具有极其重大的历史意义与世界意义的。我们在这里不打算详细讨论过去三年的战争怎样教训了帝国主义侵略者，因为这种教训是全世界都已经看到和几乎一致承认的了。三年来的朝鲜战争的最重要的政治后果，我以为，乃是证明了和平力量的不可抗拒。尽管和平的敌人因为害怕和平，曾经千方百计地要阻止和平的实现，并且直到现在也还在用一切卑鄙的阴谋来破坏和平的希望，但是毕竟不难看出，这些和平的敌人在全世界的舆论面前是多么孤立和狼狈。朝中人民的胜利，关于战俘遣返问题协议的达成，表明只有国际和平协商的方法才是解决当前国际争端、缓和当前国际局势的唯一道路。谁要是坚持侵略战争，谁就只能得到麦克阿瑟和李承晚之流的下场。李承晚及其幕后支持者的目前的疯狂叫嚣和疯狂行为，再清楚不过地向全世界说明了战争责任属于谁和正义属于谁的问题。曾经站在李承晚方面作战的一切国家的人民，现在比过去更容易了解：他们究竟支持了谁；他们流了血来支持这样一个穷凶极恶的好战集团究竟是为了什么；以及究竟是什么正义的火焰的燃烧使得朝中人民在这场生死的斗争中表现得如此英勇。
    无论如何，李承晚事件告诉我们一个真理：和平的敌人还有相当力量，而他们是不肯轻易接受和平的。历史上便有过这样的教训：蒋介石匪帮曾经在美帝国主义指使与支持下两次撕毁过与中国共产党所订的协定而发动了对当时中国解放区的大举进攻；希特勒匪帮也曾撕毁了德、苏互不侵犯条约而发起了对苏联的突然进攻。因此，在纪念“六·二五”朝鲜人民反侵略战争三周年的时候，我们除了以极其欢欣鼓舞的心情，庆祝已经取得的胜利以外，同时不能不以极严肃的态度，注视着情况的发展，和我们兄弟般的朝鲜人民军在一起，更加警惕地继续斗争，为实现朝鲜停战、为实现停战后战俘的按照协议遣返、为稳固的停战、为最后的和平解决朝鲜问题而努力。
    回顾三年来朝中人民在抗美战争中所获得的伟大的胜利，不能忘记，这是和朝中人民之间，朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军之间的高度的、战斗的团结分不开的。这种团结是建立在为保卫和平、保卫祖国独立与安全的共同的崇高目标的基础上的，是由伟大的国际主义的思想所联结起来的，是在长期的、艰巨的斗争中以血肉凝结起来的，在三年前美国侵略者所发动的侵略战争，不仅是妄想奴役朝鲜人民，并且还妄想进一步进攻中国大陆，走日本侵略者的老路。从那时起，中国人民就已经把保卫与建设自己祖国的任务同支援英勇的朝鲜人民的反侵略斗争的任务紧紧的联在一起了。特别是从中国人民志愿军入朝作战以来，和英雄的朝鲜人民军并肩作战，互相关怀，互相支援，互相热爱，互相学习，朝中人民的战斗的友谊与团结，更有了极为动人的发展。无数的罗盛教式的与朴在根式的人物的出现，便是这种将要流传千秋万世的、牢不可破的、兄弟国家的人民之间的高度国际主义友谊团结的进一步成长的标志。我们有了这种高度的、巩固的、战斗的团结，我们就能够无往而不胜。我们已经在这种团结当中，打败了比我们占有优势装备的敌人；粉碎了敌人各种卑污的挑拨；克服了战争期间的各种困难，取得了今天这样伟大的胜利。今后，我们一定要更加努力巩固和增进这种团结。中国人民志愿军一定要更加坚决执行朝鲜政府的一切政策法令，深切爱护朝鲜的一山一水一草一木，拥护朝鲜人民的领袖金日成元帅，拥护朝鲜劳动党，拥护朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府，更加虚心地向英雄的朝鲜人民和朝鲜人民军学习，严守纪律，并尽一切可能帮助兄弟的朝鲜人民共同努力，不断为更加增进朝中人民、军队之间的团结和友谊而奋斗。深信这种团结的进一步加强，必将保证在继续进行的艰巨的斗争中，引导朝中人民走向反对美帝国主义侵略的共同事业的完全胜利！
    朝中两国人民血肉结成的巩固的战斗友谊与团结万岁！
    在伟大的抗美战争中光荣牺牲的烈士们永垂不朽！
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国及其伟大领袖金日成元帅万岁！
    伟大的中国人民领袖毛泽东主席万岁！
