Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, 21st: According to TASS, the World Peace Council continued its plenary session on the afternoon of June 19, chaired by Riccardo Lombardi (Italy).

	The first speaker was the Buddhist monk from Ceylon, Saranankara. He spoke about the situation of the people of Ceylon's struggle for peace. He said that the people of Ceylon pay tribute to the forces that contributed to the Korean armistice and promoted world peace. He said, we demand the cessation of Japan's rearmament, and demand that countries, regardless of their different social systems, restore normal trade relations and restore economic and cultural relations. The Ceylon Peace Committee is conducting activities to achieve these goals. We will never allow the strength and resources of the people of Ceylon to be used to prepare for imperialist war.

	Syrian representative Ihsan Gibri said that the imperialist countries are exerting pressure in an attempt to make Syria join a military alliance. However, the people of our country sincerely desire peace. He suggested that the World Peace Council fully uphold the principle of respecting national independence declared in the resolutions of the World People's Peace Congress, because this principle lays the foundation for a solid and lasting peace.

	Jacques Mitterrand (France) spoke in detail about the need for national independence for all countries. He said that foreign troops are stationed on French territory, foreign leaders and experts often come to France, and foreign military bases are being built on French soil—all of this undermines France's national dignity and makes it impossible for it to freely decide its destiny in accordance with the interests of the people.

	Mitterrand then talked about the role of the United Nations. He emphasized that the efficiency of the United Nations depends on two conditions: all countries are represented in this organization; and every country should respect the independence and sovereignty of other countries, whether they are large or small. If a country loses its independence and freedom of action, the policy of mechanical majority will prevail in the United Nations, and the United Nations system will lose its original meaning. Therefore, it is necessary to strive to restore the independence of every country.

	Theodore Harris, representative of the British Quaker Peace Committee, spoke about the importance of uniting to strive for peace.

	Colonel Alfredo de Amaesti, a Chilean public figure, emphasized that the Chilean people are in favor of consultation, believing it to be the best course of action in international affairs. He said that the military treaty imposed on Chile by the United States has aroused widespread protests among the people.

	Mrs. E. Morgan (USA) emphasized that she was not speaking on behalf of McCarthy's America, but on behalf of Jefferson's, Robertson's America, on behalf of all the American people who hope that their husbands, sons, and brothers will return home, their husbands, sons, and brothers who have been sent to other countries as American soldiers, where the people are angry that these soldiers have come, and the soldiers themselves do not want to stay there.

	Mrs. Morgan emphasized that millions of Americans want and demand peace. She said that the cause of the American people is united with the cause of the people fighting for peace all over the world. Her words were met with a storm of applause.

	Abdel Rahman Bouchama, member of the World Peace Council from Algeria, spoke about the struggle of oppressed countries for freedom and independence, and for peace.

	Mrs. Youssef Hilmi (Egypt) said that the Egyptian people will never agree to sign any war conventions and will not stop the struggle to demand the withdrawal of foreign troops from the Suez Canal Zone.

	Mario Salazar Mallen, academician of the National Medical Institute of Mexico, said that it is necessary to develop international cultural relations. He agreed with the suggestions made by Soviet writer Vasilevska about strengthening cultural ties.

	Roudan, secretary of the World Federation of Trade Unions, reported on the struggle of working people around the world for peace and their rights. He said that working people have realized that the struggle to improve their living conditions is closely related to the maintenance of peace.

	Representatives from Guatemala, Transjordan, Spain, Finland, and other countries also spoke at the afternoon session.

	After discussion, the meeting unanimously approved the decision of the International Peace Prize and Gold Medal Evaluation Committee.

	The meeting also approved the recommendations of the Committee on Cultural Exchange.

	Finally, the conference adopted the list of new members of the World Peace Council proposed by the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council. This list had been agreed upon in advance by the delegations of various countries.

    在世界和平理事会十九日会议上
    代表们报告各国人民争取和平斗争的情况
    【新华社二十一日讯】据塔斯社布达佩斯讯：六月十九日下午，世界和平理事会继续举行全体会议，由理卡多·龙巴迪（意大利）担任主席。
    首先发言的是锡兰佛教法师撒拉南卡拉。他谈到锡兰人民争取和平的斗争情况。他说，锡兰人民向促成朝鲜停战以及促进世界和平的力量致敬。他说，我们要求停止日本的重新武装，要求各国不分社会制度的不同，恢复正常贸易关系，恢复经济和文化关系。锡兰和平委员会正进行活动，以求实现这些目标。我们决不容许锡兰人民的力量和资源被利用来进行准备帝国主义战争。
    叙利亚代表伊山·吉比里说，帝国主义国家正在行使压力，企图使叙利亚参加军事联盟。但是，我国人民都真诚地要求和平。他建议世界和平理事会全力坚持世界人民和平大会的决议中所宣布的尊重民族独立的原则，因为这个原则奠定了巩固与持久的和平的基础。
    雅克·密特朗（法国）详细地谈到各国必须具有民族独立的问题。他说，法国领土上驻有外国军队，常有外国领袖和专家来到法国，法国土地上正在建筑起外国军事基地——这一切都损害了法国的民族尊严，并使它没有可能按照人民的利益自由地决定它的命运。
    密特朗接着谈到联合国的作用。他强调指出，联合国的效率如何，决定于两个条件：一切国家都有代表参加这个机构；每一个国家都应该尊重其他国家的独立和主权，不论别国是大国还是小国。假如一个国家丧失它的独立和行动自由，机械多数的政策在联合国中就会得势，联合国的制度就会丧失它的原来意义。因此，必须争取恢复每一个国家的独立。
    英国公谊会和平委员会代表西奥多·哈里斯谈到联合起来争取和平的重要性。
    智利公众领袖艾弗雷多·德·阿迈斯蒂上校强调指出：智利人民赞成协商，认为这是国际事务中最好的行动方法。他说：美国强迫智利签订的军事条约已经引起了人民的普遍抗议。
    伊·摩根夫人（美国）强调指出：她不是代表麦卡锡的美国说话，而是代表杰弗逊、罗伯逊的美国说话，代表所有盼望他们的丈夫、儿子和兄弟回国的美国人民的美国说话，他们的丈夫、儿子和兄弟作为美国士兵被送到其他国家，那些地方的人民对于这些士兵来到感到愤怒，同时这些士兵自己也不愿耽在那里。
    摩根夫人强调指出：千百万美国人愿意并要求和平。她说：美国人民的事业是与全世界为和平而斗争的人民的事业结合在一起的。她的话博得暴风雨般的掌声。
    世界和平理事会理事、阿尔及利亚的阿卜杜勒·哈曼·布夏马谈到被压迫国家争取自由与独立、争取和平的斗争情况。
    尤塞夫·希尔米夫人（埃及）说：埃及人民永远不会同意签订任何战争公约，并且不会停止要求外国军队从苏彝士运河区撤退的斗争。
    墨西哥国立医学研究院院士马里奥·萨拉查·马伦说有必要发展国际间的文化关系。他同意苏联女作家华西列夫斯卡所提出的关于加强文化联系的建议。
    世界工会联合会书记儒丹报告了世界各地劳动人民争取和平和他们的权利的斗争情况。他说：劳动人民已经认识到争取改善他们的生活条件是与维护和平有着密切的关系的。
    在下午会议上发言的还有危地马拉、外约旦、西班牙、芬兰和其他国家的代表。
    在经过讨论以后，会议一致通过了国际和平奖金与金质奖章评议委员会的决定。
    会议也通过了关于文化交流问题委员会的建议。
    最后，大会通过世界和平理事会常务委员会所提出的新理事的名单。这个名单事先已得到各国代表团的同意。
