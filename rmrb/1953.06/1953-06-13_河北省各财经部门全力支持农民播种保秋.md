    Hebei Province's Financial and Economic Departments Fully Support Farmers in Sowing and Protecting Autumn Crops
    During the spring plowing and sowing period, the financial and economic departments of Hebei Province vigorously supported the spring plowing and sowing work. After the sowing is completed, they are continuing to support farmers in the movement to protect autumn crops.
    This year's spring plowing and sowing work in Hebei was carried out during an intense drought resistance struggle. At that time, farmers urgently needed fertilizer and water conservancy construction. Supply and marketing cooperatives, banks, agricultural supply agencies and other departments at all levels in Hebei Province provided strong support to farmers in well-digging, canal construction, and fertilizer supply. As of May 15th, the province had supplied farmers with 443 million jin of refined fertilizer. By the end of April, more than 110 billion yuan of agricultural loans of various types had been issued, including more than 23 billion yuan in water conservancy loans, supporting farmers in digging more than 8,600 wells and more than 10,000 conical wells. In twenty-eight counties, 1,700 new and repaired canals were constructed (including the twenty-eight counties). According to incomplete statistics from the province, more than 42,000 waterwheels have now been lent to farmers. More than 42.2 million jin of high-quality cotton seeds were supplied in the cotton-growing areas. In order to promote farmers' investment in production in cotton-growing areas and to support disaster-stricken farmers in self-help production, 50,000 bolts of homespun cloth, 1.5 million jin of flue-cured tobacco, and local products worth 43.7 billion yuan were purchased during the spring plowing period.
    This year, when the financial and economic departments of Hebei provided economic support to farmers for spring plowing and sowing, they began to pay attention to adopting various methods to carry out work based on the specific conditions and needs of various localities. Supply and marketing cooperatives have adopted methods such as loans, purchases, and exchanges, combining purchases and supplies, which has been very effective. The leading organs of the provincial and prefectural party and government organizations and the leading organs of the financial and economic departments have sent main cadres to the countryside to help and inspect work, which has played a great role in correcting deviations in a timely manner.
    In order to support farmers in protecting autumn seedlings, banks are continuing to help farmers dig wells in conjunction with agricultural administrative departments. Cooperatives are actively supplying topdressing fertilizer and are organizing cotton seed processing locally to prepare fertilizers needed in the third quarter. At the same time, a large number of pest control medicines and equipment are being prepared in order to support farmers in pest control in a timely manner. (Wei Lan)

    河北省各财经部门全力支持农民播种保秋
    河北省各财经部门在春耕播种期间，曾经大力支持春耕播种工作；在播种完成后，正继续支持农民的保秋运动。
    今年河北春耕播种工作是在紧张的抗旱斗争中进行的。当时农民迫切需要供应肥料和修建水利。河北省各级供销合作社、银行、农业供应社等部门即在打井、开渠、供应肥料等方面，给予农民以有力的支持。截止五月十五日，全省已供给农民细肥四亿四千三百万斤。到四月底共发放各种农业贷款一千一百多亿元，其中水利贷款有二百三十余亿元，支持农民打井八千六百多眼，锥井一万多眼，二十八个县内修整和新开渠道一千七百多条（包括二十八个县）。另据全省不完全的统计，现已贷给农民水车四万二千多辆。在棉区供应优良棉种四千二百多万斤。为了推动棉区农民投资生产和支持灾区农民生产自救，曾在春耕期间收购土布五万匹，烤烟一百五十万斤和价值四百三十七亿元的土产。
    今年河北各财经部门对农民的春耕播种进行经济扶持的时候，已开始注意根据各地的具体情况和群众的要求，采用各种办法进行工作。供销社曾采取了贷、买、换等方法，实行收购与供应相结合，收效很大。省和专区党政领导机关及各财经部门的领导机关，都派出主要干部下乡，帮助工作和检查工作，这对及时纠正偏向有很大作用。
    为了支持农民保护秋苗，银行正结合农业行政部门，继续帮助农民打井；合作社正积极供应追肥，并就地组织棉籽加工，准备第三季度需要的肥料；同时准备好大量的治虫药械，以便及时支持农民除治虫害。（蔚蓝）
