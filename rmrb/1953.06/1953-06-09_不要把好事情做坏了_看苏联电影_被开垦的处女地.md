Don't Spoil a Good Thing
-- Watching the Soviet Film "Virgin Soil Upturned"

Screenplay: Sholokhov, Yermolinsky Director: Leishman Translator: Liu Chi Produced by Moscow Film Studio, Translated by Northeast Film Studio of the Central Film Bureau

The novel "Virgin Soil Upturned" by the famous Soviet writer Sholokhov was introduced to China eighteen years ago. This work, because it profoundly reflects the great struggle of the Soviet people in building a socialist society in the 1930s, has a very profound educational significance for us. I remember when we read this book around the time of the War of Resistance Against Japan, it left an extremely deep impression on us. In the book, Andrei, the chairman of the Soviet of Gremyachy village, was soft-hearted when dealing with class enemies. Davydov, the district committee representative who was newly sent to the village to help establish a collective farm, told him: "You feel sorry for them... you pity them. But have they ever pitied us? Did our enemies ever cry when they saw our children's tears? Did they ever cry for the orphans of the people they killed?" These words, which are enough to arouse the class consciousness of the working people, have been unforgettable for many years. Also, regarding Lagulov, the branch secretary of Gremyachy village, when the district committee secretary (who had made even more serious mistakes than Lagulov) proposed to expel him from the Party because he had made mistakes in his work, Lagulov convulsed as if his whole body was cramping, and said: "Where will I go if I leave the Party? ... I won't hand over my Party membership card... If that's the case, it would be better to have soldiers shoot me..." These words have also left a deep impression on us for many years.

Now, we have gained some new understanding from watching the film adapted from this novel. The so-called "new" is not something that was not in the original novel, but something that we did not feel as deeply as we do today in the past real struggles. That is: as a Party working cadre, how should you work in the process of guiding farmers to collectivization?

The decision of the Soviet Communist Party in 1930 to guide the country's agriculture towards collectivization was great and correct. At the same time, there were indeed many cadres like Davydov depicted in the film who understood the spirit of the Party's policies and were able to correctly implement the Party's policies. However, there were also some people who showed impatience and rashness in their work, were not good at patiently carrying out persuasion and education work among the farmers, were not good at waiting for the farmers to become aware, and especially did not understand that organizing farmers should be based on the principle of voluntariness. As a result, many people spoiled a good thing. Lagulov, depicted in the film, is one such person who spoiled a good thing.

Lagulov is the village branch secretary of Gremyachy village. During the Civil War, he participated in the Red Army, was wounded, and received the Red Banner Medal. However, when he left the army and returned to the village to lead the farmers to organize collective farms, he often revealed a fiery temper in handling internal problems of the farmers. When the district committee mistakenly instructed Gremyachy village to complete "100%" collectivization within a limited time, what did he say to Davydov?

Lagulov: We made a mistake with you. You are too polite, (referring to farmers who are unwilling to join the collective farm) originally, we should have pulled them all in by the neck at once.
Davydov: Don't go too far, comrade.
Lagulov: Come on, you're still far from it! Why is your brain so useless! We will delay the world revolution! ...
Davydov: ...I won't force everyone to join in order to shut up the district committee. Joining the collective farm is voluntary, you don't understand this. The middle peasants are our allies, not enemies.
Lagulov: Allies, but if this ally of yours still doesn't want to forget his private property today, how can I still beg them to join one by one?
Davydov: ...We need to clarify our policies, it won't work to beat people with sticks.
Lagulov: But as for me, as long as there are instructions from the Party, I will shoot all those who oppose the collective farm.
Davydov: Bastard! When did the Party ever tell us to do this?

Just as the poor peasant old Schukar introduced Lagulov's situation at the beginning: "Like in 1918," "all he talks about is 'world revolution'." For this, he thought that his wife was also superfluous to him, because this would hinder the "world revolution"! The middle peasant Bannik refused to join the collective farm no matter what, and in Lagulov's view, this naturally hindered the "world revolution" even more. He talked to Bannik from "awareness" to "socialism," from "socialism" to "the oppression of foreign bourgeoisie," and from "the oppression of foreign bourgeoisie" to "world revolution." Regarding this "world revolution," he also made an analogy, saying: "It's like you, brother, don't want to live in our Gremyachy place, and you think it's too windy here, you can take a free ride to a warmer place. For example, to Africa. ...You can participate in labor in the collective farm there, and grow some vegetables in the vegetable garden work team there..."

However, Bannik was not enthusiastic about growing vegetables in Africa, and was worried that after joining the collective farm and handing over the grain seeds, next spring he would "not even get an empty sack." But Lagulov didn't care about this, he spent a lot of effort, but Bannik still refused to join the collective farm, which made him angry. He started scolding, and then fighting. After the fight, he forced Bannik to write an "application" to join the collective farm with a pistol.

There are even more ridiculous things! The collective farm collectivized the villagers' private milk cows, as well as chickens, ducks, lambs, etc., which made the wife of the peasant Metannikov, who first agreed to organize the collective farm, cry in bed: "The lambs have to sleep in a warm place, you can't leave them unattended!"

For the sake of pursuing percentages, forcing farmers to organize, and collectivizing farmers' own milk cows and small livestock and poultry, who would benefit from such things? Anyone who has seen this film will understand: this will only benefit the White Guard officer Borovzeff, who comes riding on horseback in the middle of the night. They will use the farmers' dissatisfaction with the collective farm to organize riots and directly oppose the Soviet government. In this way, it is not, as Lagulov said, completing the "world revolution" ahead of schedule, but delaying the world revolution. Comrade Stalin's article "Dizzy with Success" severely criticized this error.

Lagulov's mistakes are serious, but he does not intend to harm the Party and the Soviet government. When Davydov first came to this village, he said to him: "Marx and Engels, these two learned comrades, wrote it right: all the sins in the world come from that damned private property. Now that we are busy building collective farms, I am extremely relaxed. Otherwise, everyone would still be like pigs grabbing food, fighting over that little bit of private property! The rich peasants grow like weeds, so that we can't see the sun." Lagulov's words are of course correct. But he did not understand that the Party's policy on agricultural collectivization was first of all to "liberate the peasants from poverty." Therefore, the Party's policy for the benefit of the peasants must never be put in opposition to the peasants. The peasants do not understand the Party's policies all at once because they have lived in the old way for generations, and based on their past experience, they will naturally have concerns and doubts about agricultural collectivization. Bannik said: "I lived with my own brother Peter, and we couldn't get along. Old women fighting, you can't even separate them with boiling water. My brother and I had to split up. You're busy putting everyone in the village together here, I think you have to install a police officer, otherwise there won't be any peace." Even the poor peasant old Schukar was skeptical about the collective farm. Schukar once said to Davydov that the villagers' views on the collective farm were "different from each other," and what about himself? "Lagulov used to say to me, old man, you are the basic element of the government, you have to stand firm. I stood firm. But I said, can the collective farm stand firm?" For these reasons, it is necessary to persuade and educate the farmers, to wait for the farmers to become aware, and to rely on advanced farmers to educate them with facts, so that they gradually eliminate this doubt and concern. And should not be forced.

Our Party's current working policy in the countryside is, on the one hand, to firmly point out to the peasants that only by organizing and gradually transitioning to socialist collective farms—using machines to produce—can the peasants' poverty be fundamentally eliminated; on the other hand, when guiding the peasants to collectivization, it is necessary to adopt the principle of voluntariness, and no one can be forced.

Anyone who does not understand this will make mistakes in his work like Lagulov.

Finally, let's talk about the issue of grasping this theme in the film.

Since this film mainly shows how Party cadres should treat farmers in rural work, when dealing with such events, the film always treats them as internal problems of the people.

Look at the fight between Lagulov and Bannik, although the film has ample opportunities and possibilities to depict how they fought back and forth, the film is not at all fascinated by this. Instead, they are placed at a certain distance. Only through the crack of the door can the audience see their actions. The director firmly grasps the theme of the film, and through these shots, he explains what the director is emphasizing and what he is not emphasizing.

For example, the film depicts the farm women mistakenly believing the rumors of counter-revolutionaries, saying that the farm management committee was going to transport wheat seeds to foreign countries, thus causing a riot. The film also grasps this point extremely well. Davydov was surrounded and beaten by them, but Davydov remained calm all the time, and only at the most critical moment did he say: "Old woman, you are so old, are you still hitting me? Then I will have to fight back." But he did not do it. He only said: "Oh my! So muddle-headed! It's all for you, and you still want to beat me to death!" In this scene, the actor Dobrenravov, who played Davydov, performed extremely well. He did not blur his class consciousness because of this grievance, and did not lose his confidence in the future in times of crisis. At the last general meeting of all the villagers in the film, his face still had scars, but he seemed to have not experienced such an unpleasant thing. He only said: "The Communist Party doesn't hold grudges, what it refuses to forgive are those enemies. But you women villagers are just temporarily going astray."

The village branch secretary Lagulov went the wrong way; that was because he made the mistake of being rash, detached from the masses, and resorting to coercion and commandism; the farm members also went the wrong way, in Davydov's words, "the women villagers were swaying towards the rich peasants." But as a woman villager said at the last meeting: "Don't take this to heart. The villagers' hearts are not sure... We still have to live together."

These descriptions all highlight the theme of this film very well.

    不要把好事情做坏了
    ——看苏联电影“被开垦的处女地”
    钟惦棐
    编剧：萧洛霍夫、耶尔冒林斯基  导演：莱支曼  翻译：刘迟莫斯科电影制片厂出品  中央电影局东北电影制片厂译制
    苏联著名作家萧洛霍夫的小说“被开垦的处女地”被介绍到中国来，已经有十八个年头了。这一著作，由于深刻地反映了三十年代中苏联人民在建设社会主义社会中的伟大斗争，它对我们的教育意义是极深长的。记得我们在抗战前后读这本书的时候，它给我们的印象是极其深刻的。书中格内米雅其村苏维埃主席安德烈在对付阶级敌人时表现心软，新派到村里来帮助建立集体农庄的区委代表达维多夫告诉他说：“你替他们难受……你可怜他们。而他们可怜过我们么？我们的敌人看到我们的孩子们的眼泪，曾经哭过么？他们曾经为了他们杀死的人们的孤儿哭过么？”这些足以激发劳动人民的阶级意识的话，许多年来总使人难忘。还有，关于格内米雅其村的支部书记拉古尔洛夫，由于在工作中犯了错误，被区委书记（比拉古尔洛夫的错误更严重的人）提议要开除他的党籍的时候，拉古尔洛夫全身都痉挛了似的，说：“我离开了党，到什么地方去呢？……我不交出我的党证……如果是这样，倒不如让兵士把我枪毙了好些……”这些话多年来仍给我们以深刻的印象。
    现在，我们看根据这小说改编成的电影，又得到一些新的认识。所谓“新的”，并不是原小说里所没有的，而是在过去的现实斗争中，我们没有像今天这样深刻地感觉到它。这就是：你作为一个党的工作干部，在引导农民走向集体化的过程中，应该怎样工作？
    苏联共产党在一九三○年决议把全国农业引向集体化的方针是伟大正确的。同时也确有许多像影片中描写的达维多夫这样的干部，是懂得党的政策精神，并能够正确地执行党的政策的。但是，也有这样一些人，他们在工作中表现了急躁冒进，不善于耐心地在农民中进行说服教育工作，不善于等待农民的觉悟，特别是不懂得把农民组织起来，应该根据自愿的原则。这样，就有许多人把好事情做坏了。影片中所描写的拉古尔洛夫，便是这样一个把好事情做坏了的人。
    拉古尔洛夫是格内米雅其村的村支部书记。在内战时期，他参加过红军，负过伤，得过红旗勋章。但是，当他离开部队，回到村里领导农民组织集体农庄的时候，在处理农民内部的问题上，他常常流露出一股火药味儿。当区委错误地指示格内米雅其村必须在限期内完成“百分之百”的集体化时，他对达维多夫说了些什么呢——
    拉：我们跟你犯了错误。你太客气啦，（指对不愿参加集体农庄的农民）本来?，应该一下子牵着脖子都给拉进来。
    达：你可别过了火，同志。
    拉：得啦，你还远着哪！你的脑子怎么那么不好使唤！我们这样会耽误世界革命啊！……
    达：……为了堵住区委会的嘴，强迫大伙儿，我不干。参加农庄是自愿的事情，这个你不懂。中农是我们的盟友，不是敌人。
    拉：盟友，可若是你这个盟友今天还是不肯忘掉他那点私有财产，那我怎么还得一个个的来央告他们参加？
    达：……得弄清我们的政策，拿着棒子揍可不行。
    拉：可是我么，只要有党的指示，我会把那些反对集体农庄的人，通通把他们枪毙掉。
    达：混蛋！党多?告诉过我们这样做？
    正如贫农老西奚卡开始介绍拉古尔洛夫的情形一样：“跟一九一八年一样”，“一张嘴就是‘世界革命’”。为了这个，他以为老婆对于他也是多余的，因为这会妨碍“世界革命”！中农班尼克说什么也不肯参加集体农庄，在拉古尔洛夫看来，自然就更妨碍“世界革命”了。他对班尼克从“觉悟”说到“社会主义”，从“社会主义”说到“外国资产阶级的压迫”，又从“外国资产阶级的压迫”说到“世界革命”。关于这个“世界革命”，他还打了一套比方，说：“好比你老兄吧，不愿意住在咱们格内米雅其这个地方，嫌这儿风太大，你就可以免费坐车到一个暖和的地方去。比方说，到非洲那边。……你可以在那边的集体农庄参加劳动，在那儿的菜园工作队里种点青菜……”
    可是班尼克并不热心于到非洲去种青菜，而耽心着参加了集体农庄，把粮食种子交了，到明年春天
    “连个空麻袋都捞不着。”但拉古尔洛夫是不管这些的，他费了很大唇舌，而班尼克还是不肯参加集体农庄，这便使他发火了。开始骂起来，然后打起来。打过之后，用手枪逼着班尼克写参加集体农庄的“申请书”。
    胡搞的事情还有哩！集体农庄把庄员们自用的乳牛以及鸡、鸭、羊羔等也归集体农庄公有了，弄得最先赞成组织集体农庄的农民梅谭尼阔夫的老婆爬在床上哭：“小羊羔得睡暖和地方，不照看不行呀！”
    为了追求百分数，强迫农民组织起来，并且把农民自用的乳牛以及小家畜家禽也公有，这样的事情，会对谁有利呢？看过这部电影的人就会明白：这只有对那夜半骑着马来的白党军官——波罗夫则夫这样的人有利。他们会利用农民对集体农庄的不满情绪组织暴动，直接反对苏维埃政府。这样，就不是像拉古尔洛夫说的，提前完成“世界革命”，而是延迟了世界革命。斯大林同志的“胜利冲昏头脑”一文，严厉地指摘了这一错误。
    拉古尔洛夫的错误是严重的，但他并不是存心要危害党和苏维埃政府。当达维多夫刚到这村里来的时候，他就对他说过：“马克思和恩格斯这两位有学问的同志写得真对：世上一切罪恶都是由于该死的私有财产而来。现在张罗着建设集体农庄，我呀，我轻松极了。要不大伙儿还得像抢食的猪似的，因为这点私有财产，在那儿夺来夺去！富农呢，长得像野草似的，叫我们见不着太阳。”拉古尔洛夫的这些话当然是对的。但是他不明白，党关于农业集体化的政策，首先是为了把农民“从贫困里解救出来”。因之绝不可把党的为了农民利益的政策，拿去和农民对立起来。农民一下不了解党的政策，这是因为他们祖祖辈辈都过着老式的生活，根据他们以往的经验，很自然地会对农业集体化产生顾虑和怀疑。班尼克说：“我跟我的亲兄弟彼得一起住过，我们就合不来。老娘们打架呀，就是用开水也泼不开。我们哥儿俩势必得分家。你们在这儿张罗把全村子的人都归到一块儿，我看非安个警察不行，要不没个安宁。”甚至连贫农老西奚卡也对集体农庄怀疑过。西奚卡曾对达维多夫说过，村里人对集体农庄的看法是“一个人一个样”，而他自己呢？“以前拉古尔洛夫跟我说过，老爷子，你是政府的基层分子，得站牢靠一点。我站牢靠了。可是我说，集体农庄它能站牢靠吗？”为了这些，就需要说服教育农民，就需要等待农民觉悟，就需要依靠先进的农民用事实去教育他们，使他们逐步地消除这种怀疑和顾虑。而不应强迫。
    我们党今天在农村中的工作方针，一方面是坚定不移地向农民指出，只有组织起来，逐渐过渡到社会主义的集体农庄——使用机器来生产，这样才能从根本上解除农民的贫困；另一方面，在引导农民走向集体化的道路时，一定要采取自愿的原则，谁也不能强迫。
    谁不了解这点，谁就会像拉古尔洛夫这样，在工作中犯错误。
    最后，我们来谈一谈与此有关的，在电影中把握这一主题思想方面的问题。
    由于这部电影主要是表现党的干部在农村工作中应如何对待农民的问题，所以电影在处理这一类事件时，总是把它作为人民内部的问题来看的。
    试看拉古尔洛夫和班尼克的打架，电影尽管有充分的机会和可能去描写他们是怎样你来我往的，但是，电影却一点也不醉心于这点。而是把他们摆在一定的距离之外。只有通过门缝，观众才看得见他们的行动。导演紧紧把握住了影片的主题思想，通过这些镜头说明导演在强调什么和不强调什么。
    又如，电影描写农庄妇女们因为误信了反革命分子的谣言，说农庄管理委员会要把麦种运到外国去，因而引起了一场骚动。这一点，电影也是把握得极有分寸的。达维多夫被他们包围了，打了，但是达维多夫却一直保持着镇静，只在最危急的时候，他才说：“老大娘，你这么大年纪了，你还打我吗？这我可要还手了。”但他并未动手。他只说：
    “哎呀呀！真浑！都是为了你们，你们还要打死我！”这一场面，饰达维多夫的演员道布伦拉沃夫表演得极好。他没有因为这一委屈，而模糊了自己的阶级意识，没有在危难中丧失了自己对于明天的信心。在电影的最后一次全体庄员大会上，他的脸上还带着伤疤，但他却好像并没有经历过这么一场不愉快的事情。他只说：“共产党它不记仇，它不肯饶恕的是那些敌人。可是你们这些妇女老乡们呢，不过是一时走错了路。”
    村支部书记拉古尔洛夫走错过路；那是他犯了冒进的脱离群众和强迫命令的错误；农庄庄员们也走错过路，用达维多夫的话来说，是“妇女老乡们往富农那边动摇来着”。可是正如在最后一次会上，一个妇女老乡说的：“这事儿别往心里去。老乡们的心里都不摸底……日子还得一块儿过。”
    这些描写，都很好地突出了这部影片的主题。
