    A Shoddily Built New Staff Dormitory
    A letter from Wang Ziping of Qinhuangdao Station: The former Tianjin Railway Branch Bureau Engineering Team built one hundred dormitory rooms for the staff of Qinhuangdao Engineering Section and Qinhuangdao Station at the end of last year. At that time, many employees happily moved in. However, after moving in, everyone found that although these houses had electricity and running water, they could not be used. The roof construction was particularly shoddy, and it leaked every time it rained. Employees have raised many objections to this, and although the engineering team made a review, the dormitory has not been properly repaired.
    On the evening of May 5th, there was heavy rain, and the new dormitory leaked badly. The furniture of the residents was soaked in rainwater, and many residents had to brave the rain, holding their children and carrying their bedding, to borrow rooms in the traffic apartment and other dormitories that night. Zuo Youlin of the freight office could not find a place to shelter from the rain and had to set up a tent in the room; Bao Zhengquan's entire family huddled under the bed to avoid the rain. After the rain stopped, the dormitory was still uninhabitable because "it doesn't rain outside, but the house still drips, and when it's dry outside, there's still water in the house." The employees are extremely dissatisfied and demand that the Tianjin Railway Administration conduct an immediate inspection and that the dormitory be repaired immediately.

### 一个粗制滥造的新建职工宿舍

    一个粗制滥造的新建职工宿舍
    秦皇岛车站王子平来信：原天津铁路分局工程队在去年年底为秦皇岛工务段及秦皇岛车站的职工建筑了一百间宿舍，当时不少职工都兴高采烈地搬进去。但住进去后，大家发现这些房屋虽有电灯和自来水设备，却都不能使用。屋顶建筑得尤其粗制滥造，每逢下雨就漏。职工们对此提过不少意见，工程队虽然作了检讨，但这个宿舍并未得到适当的修整。
    五月五日傍晚下大雨，新建宿舍漏得很厉害。住户的家具都被雨水浸透，不少住户当晚不得不抱着孩子、掮着铺盖冒雨到行车公寓和其他宿舍内借住。货运室的左有霖同志找不到躲雨的地方，只得在屋内搭起了帐篷；包正权同志的全家老小一起钻在床底下躲雨。雨停后，这个宿舍还是不能住人。因为“外面不下屋里还滴水，外面干了屋里还存水”。职工们极为不满，都要求天津铁路管理局迅速进行检查，并要求立即把这个宿舍修理好。
