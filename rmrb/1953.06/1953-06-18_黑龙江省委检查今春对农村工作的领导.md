The Heilongjiang Provincial Party Committee Inspects Leadership of Rural Work This Spring

In late May, the Heilongjiang Provincial Party Committee convened a joint meeting of county party committee secretaries and county party committee office directors. Using criticism and self-criticism, the meeting inspected the leadership of the province and counties in rural work, summarized spring plowing, discussed summer hoeing, and arranged work for the second half of the year.

At the meeting, the following three aspects were used to examine the previous implementation of the CPC Central Committee's policies on agricultural production, and the direction of future efforts was determined.

Regarding Mutual Aid and Cooperation

This spring, Heilongjiang Province actively and steadily promoted the mutual aid and cooperation movement, based on the progress of national industrial development and the current situation of the small-peasant economy. As early as January and February, a series of symposiums on agricultural producers' cooperatives, meetings of labor model representatives, and rural work conferences attended by county party committee secretaries and district party committee secretaries were held to repeatedly implement the CPC Central Committee's policy on mutual aid and cooperation in agricultural production. This year, Heilongjiang's mutual aid teams focused on solving the problem of mutual benefit in exchanging labor, improving the small-group rotational cropping system, establishing a democratic leadership system, and establishing organizations for technical research. They also criticized the tendency to blindly form large groups and establish public property. In terms of agricultural producers' cooperatives, the spontaneous trend of blindly establishing cooperatives regardless of conditions was prevented. The Provincial Party Committee used the Li Zhenshan Agricultural Producers' Cooperative led by the Zhaoyuan County Party Committee as a typical example, severely criticizing the practices of blindly setting up stalls, blindly expanding public property, and mistakenly unified planning for the production and consumption of cooperative members. This basically curbed the undesirable tendencies within cooperatives of large stalls, heavy debts, large amounts of waste, and the pursuit of formalism. Based on the experience of key pilot cooperatives last year, since the beginning of spring this year, various localities have focused on solving problems such as labor organization within the cooperatives, the production responsibility system, short-term contracting, and quota piecework. After this series of rectification and construction work, the mutual aid and cooperation movement has basically developed normally. The number of mutual aid teams was reduced from 130,000 last year to 100,000 this year. This shows that the organizational form of mutual aid teams has expanded and improved. The number of agricultural producers' cooperatives increased from 170 last year to 717 this year. They generally have a good foundation, strong leadership backbone, and implement a management policy focused on agricultural production. The number of spontaneously organized cooperatives was 217 last year (most of which were converted into mutual aid teams after rectification), and only 17 this year.

Comrade Feng Jixin, Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, pointed out at the meeting: Although the mutual aid and cooperation movement has achieved these results, some places have not done well enough, and the thought of impatience and rash advance has not been completely resolved. Many practical tasks for consolidating and improving mutual aid and cooperation have not kept up. Although the thought of blind advance was criticized and the policy of "active leadership, steady advance" was emphasized, due to our insufficient understanding of the progress of national industrialization, insufficient understanding of the current situation of the small-peasant economy, and insufficient understanding of the long-term nature of the socialist transformation of agriculture, we once required basic collectivization within five years; this is the root cause of the impatient and rash emotions of many cadres. In addition, many district party committee comrades are still unfamiliar with agricultural producers' cooperatives, and the management of newly established cooperatives is not keeping up, labor organization is chaotic, there is a lack of production plans and responsibility systems, labor calculation is unreasonable, and political work has not kept up, and the financial system is unsound; therefore, phenomena such as idling, absenteeism, lack of responsibility, and waste are still very serious.

Everyone unanimously believed that the future mutual aid and cooperation movement should be steadily consolidated and improved, implementing mutually beneficial policies, enriching mutual aid content, improving farming techniques, and striving to produce more grain, and continuing to overcome the tendency of blind advance in ideology and practical work; but at the same time, it is necessary to strictly prevent self-flow and strengthen the leadership of the Party; relaxing the leadership of mutual aid and cooperation is wrong.

Regarding Improving Technology

Heilongjiang Province has achieved certain results this year in leading the masses to improve agricultural technology and promote the Zhaoyuan high-yield experience. During spring plowing and sowing this year, about 30 percent of the large autumn crops promoted the Zhaoyuan "wide-row planting" experience, and about 40 percent of wheat implemented rational close planting. During the spring plowing process, Zhaoyuan County also proposed methods such as "planting in order of arrangement and thinning in order of arrangement," which further enriched and supplemented last year's farming methods.

Comrade Feng Jixin also made a self-criticism of the work of improving agricultural technology in his report. He said: In the promotion of technology and technological reform, serious phenomena of greed for quantity and rash advance and coercion and commandism also occurred due to not starting from the current situation of the small-peasant economy and exceeding the awareness level of farmers. When starting to promote the Zhaoyuan high-yield experience, the plans were too large and the requirements were too high, with planned yields increasing at each level. The work of promoting improved agricultural tools for wide-row planting was also not cautious, with too much unified manufacturing from top to bottom and too little reliance on the masses to transform them themselves. In increasing manure fertilizer, instead of trying to obtain materials locally as much as possible and expanding the source of manure, manure was purchased from thousands of miles away regardless of cost, so that the price of manure was equal to the price of grain. In promoting pesticides and chemical fertilizers, the plans were too large, and many places forced apportionment according to land and households. The promotion of horse-drawn agricultural implements and the establishment of technical guidance stations also had the phenomenon of emphasizing quantity over quality. This increased the burden and concerns of the masses and encouraged coercion and commandism among lower-level cadres, turning good things into bad things. He said: An important experience must be accepted: Because farming in North Manchuria is rough and production technology is backward, the work of technology promotion and technological reform must continue to be strengthened; it is wrong to ignore this aspect of work. However, in implementing this task, we must take into account the specific situation in today's countryside, the characteristics of the small-peasant economy, and start from the farmers' own experience, leading the masses to do it themselves. We must not take over everything and must combine the inherent reasonable experience of local farmers with science and technology. On this issue, we must implement the policy of key experiments, summarizing experience, organizing visits, and gradually promoting.

Regarding Leadership Methods

According to the instructions of the Party Central Committee on spring plowing, the provincial, county, and district party committees generally paid attention to making spring plowing and sowing the overriding central task in the countryside, controlling meetings and departmental work, and prohibiting the excessive issuance of documents and forms. During the spring plowing, the Provincial Party Committee organized more than 130 people and went to the countryside three times to lead and cooperate with more than 6,000 cadres in various counties to go deep into the countryside to inspect and promote spring plowing production. In general, the leadership of spring plowing production this year paid attention to "organizing forces in stages according to the season, going deep into the lower levels, discovering problems, and solving them on the spot," "leaders personally doing things, going deep into key points, setting a good example, combining points and surfaces," and "visiting in person, doing, teaching, and promoting at the same time."

However, deviations also occurred in the leadership of rural work. Because some party members and non-party activists participating in party rectification applied certain party principles to the outside of the party and openly criticized rich peasants' exploitation in society; in addition, the coercive and commanding style of some party members and cadres due to impatience increased the ideological concerns of some farmers, who were unwilling to expand production, some even selling their carts and horses, planting less land, eating and drinking heavily, and waiting for "merging into large piles." This phenomenon was basically reversed only after policy re-education. Egalitarianism, decentralism, and the "five excessive" phenomena still exist. According to statistics from Nehe County, the Provincial Party Committee and Provincial Government issued more than 1,300 various instructions and documents in five months this year, the county issued more than 300 to the district, and the district issued more than 200 to the village. Many of these are unnecessary, and some statistics are not true. After some department cadres go down, they one-sidedly emphasize departmental work and become detached from current production.

Regarding strengthening and improving the Party's leadership over rural work, Zhang Shiying, Deputy Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, said in his conclusion: Not only during the spring plowing stage, but also during summer hoeing, autumn harvest, and all other busy farming seasons, agricultural production must be the overriding central task in the countryside. During the busy farming season, all rural work cadres, regardless of which department they belong to, must without exception first do a good job in agricultural production. All departments above the county level related to rural work can only carry out their work around agricultural production, only serve agricultural production, cannot emphasize their own business systems, and cannot disperse the strength of district and village organizations to lead production. In addition, during the busy farming season, all agencies must not arbitrarily transfer district or village cadres to meetings or training; when necessary, they must be approved by the party committee. This is not to cancel the work of various departments, but to be good at promoting various organizations and giving full play to their organizational strength to serve agricultural production. The province and counties should issue fewer documents, and when necessary, they must be approved by the heads of the party committee and administrative departments. Various departments must not make their own decisions. Counties should generally not issue or issue fewer instructions and documents to districts and villages, but should adopt the method of sending people down to inspect and calling people up to report, giving instructions or researching work face-to-face. It is necessary to advocate using the flexible method of writing informal letters to obtain contact in a timely manner, instead of not writing for a long time and then writing a comprehensive work report.

    黑龙江省委检查今春对农村工作的领导
    五月下旬，中共黑龙江省委召开了县委书记、县委办公室主任联席会议，以批评自我批评的方法，检查了省、县对农村工作的领导，总结了春耕，讨论了夏锄，并且安排了下半年的工作。
    会议上从以下三方面检查了以前执行中共中央关于农业生产政策的情形，确定了今后的努力方向。
    关于互助合作
    黑龙江省今春根据国家工业发展的进度和小农经济的现状，积极而又稳步地提高了互助合作运动。早在今年一、二月间，就连续召开了农业生产合作社座谈会、劳动模范代表会以及由县委书记、区委书记参加的农村工作会议，反复贯彻了中共中央关于农业生产互助合作的政策。今年黑龙江的互助组着重解决了换工的互利问题，改进了小组轮作制度，建立了民主领导制度，建立了技术研究的组织；并批判了盲目搞大组、搞公共财产的偏向。在农业生产合作社方面，防止了不顾条件盲目建社的自发趋势。省委曾以瞻榆县委领导的李振山农业生产合作社为典型，严厉地批判了盲目摆摊子、盲目扩大公共财产、错误地统一计划安排社员生产消费的做法，基本上制止了合作社内摊子大、债务多、浪费大、追求形式等不良倾向。根据去年重点试办合作社的经验，今年入春以来，各地着重解决了社内的劳动组织、生产责任制、短期包工、定额计件等问题。经过了这一系列的整顿和建设工作，使互助合作运动基本上正常地发展着。互助组由去年的十三万个归并成今年的十万个。这说明互助组的组织形式是扩大了，提高了。农业生产合作社去年一百七十个，今年又新建了七百一十七个，一般的基础较好，领导骨干较强，实行了以农业生产为主的经营方针。自发组织的合作社去年是二百一十七个
    （经整顿后大部分改为互助组），今年只有十七个。
    省委书记冯纪新同志在会议上指出：互助合作运动虽然获得这些成绩，但有些地方作的还不够好，急躁冒进的思想尚未彻底解决，巩固和提高互助合作的许多实际工作还没有跟上。虽然批判了盲目冒进的思想，强调了贯彻“积极领导，稳步前进”的方针，但由于我们对国家工业化的进度认识不足，对小农经济的现状认识不够，对农业的社会主义改造的长期性认识不足，因此曾要求在五年内基本合作化；这就是许多干部的急躁冒进情绪的根源。此外，许多区委同志对农业生产合作社还不熟悉，新建的社的经营管理工作跟不上，劳动组织紊乱，缺乏生产计划和责任制，劳动计算不合理，政治工作未跟上，财务制度不健全；因此，窝工、旷工、无人负责和浪费现象还很严重。
    大家一致认为：今后的互助合作运动，应当稳步地巩固与提高，贯彻互利政策，充实互助内容，改进耕作技术，争取多打粮食，从思想上和实际工作中继续克服盲目冒进倾向；但必须同时严格防止自流，加强党的领导；放松对互助合作的领导是错误的。
    关于改进技术
    黑龙江省今年领导群众改进农业技术，推广肇源丰产经验，取得一定的成绩。今年春耕播种中，约有百分之三十的大秋作物，推行了肇源的“宽播”经验，约有百分之四十的小麦，实行了合理密植。肇源县在春耕过程中，又提出了“排开次序播种，排开次序间苗”等办法，更加丰富和充实了去年的耕作法。
    冯纪新同志在报告中，也对改进农业技术的工作作了检讨。他说：在技术推广和技术改革上，也是由于不从小农经济现状出发，超越了农民觉悟程度，产生了严重的贪多冒进和强迫命令现象。开始推广肇源丰产经验时，计划过大，要求过高，层层增加计划产量。对于推广宽播用的改良农具的工作也不慎重，自上而下统一制造多，依靠群众亲自动手改造少。在增加粪肥上，不是尽量就地取材，扩大粪源，而是不计成本，到千里以外去采购大粪，以致粪价等于粮价。在推广农药和化学肥料上，计划过大，许多地方按地按户强迫摊派。马拉农具推广工作和技术指导站的建立，也有重量不重质的现象。这就增加了群众的负担和顾虑，助长了下面干部的强迫命令，把好事办成坏事。他说：必须接受一项重要经验：由于北满耕作粗糙，生产技术落后，因此，技术推广和技术改革工作必须继续加强，忽视这方面的工作是错误的。但是在实行这一任务时，必须照顾到今天农村的具体情况，必须照顾到小农经济的特点，必须从农民的切身经验出发，领导群众自己动手，不可包办代替，而必须把当地农民固有的合理经验与科学技术结合起来。在这个问题上，必须实行重点试验，总结经验，组织参观，逐步推广的方针。
    关于领导方法
    根据党中央关于春耕工作的指示，省和县、区的党委一般的都注意了以春耕播种为农村压倒一切的中心任务，控制了会议和部门工作，禁止滥发文件、表格。在春耕中，省委组织了一百三十余人，先后三次下乡，领导并配合各县干部六千余人，深入农村检查与推动春耕生产。今年春耕生产领导上，一般都注意了“按季分段组织力量，深入下层，发现问题，就地解决”、“领导亲自动手，深入重点，作好样子，点面结合”、“实地参观，边作、边教、边推广”。
    但是，农村工作的领导方面，也曾经发生了偏差。因为有一部分党员和参加整党的非党积极分子，把若干党内原则运用到党外去，在社会上公开批判富农剥削；再加上一部分党员、干部因为急躁而产生了强迫命令的作风，使一部分农民增加了思想顾虑，不愿扩大生产，有的甚至卖车卖马，少种地，大吃大喝，等着“归大堆”。后经政策补课，才基本上扭转了这种现象。平均主义、分散主义和“五多”现象也仍然存在着。根据讷河县的统计，省委、省府今年五个月内发下的各种指示、文件达一千三百余件，县发到区的三百多件，区发到村的二百多件。其中有很多是不必要的，有些统计是不真实的。有些部门的干部下去以后，片面地强调部门工作，脱离当前生产。
    关于加强和改进党对农村工作的领导问题，省委副书记张士英在结论中说：不仅春耕阶段，而且夏锄、秋收等一切农忙时期，都必须以农业生产为农村压倒一切的中心任务。在农忙期间，一切农村工作的干部，不论属于那个部门，都要毫无例外地首先作好农业生产工作。县以上的各部门有关农村的工作，只能围绕农业生产进行，只能服务于农业生产，不能强调自己的业务系统，不能分散区、村组织领导生产的力量。此外，在农忙期间，各机关均不得擅自调区、村干部开会、训练；必要调遣时，需经党委批准。这并不是取消各部门工作，而且要善于推动各种组织，发挥其组织力量，服务于农业生产。省、县应少发文件，必要时需经过党委和行政部门首长审批，各部门不得自作主张。县对区、村一般不发或少发指示文件，应采取派下去检查、调上来汇报的办法，面对面地给予指示或研究工作。要提倡用灵活的写便信的办法，及时取得联系，不要很长时间不写，一写就是全面的工作报告。  （方青）
