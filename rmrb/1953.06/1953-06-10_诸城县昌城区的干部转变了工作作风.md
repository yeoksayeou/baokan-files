The cadres in Changcheng District, Zhucheng County, Shandong Province, used to be one of the districts in the county where work progressed slowly and where cadres' coercive orders and violations of law and discipline were relatively serious. However, it is also a district where the work style of district and township cadres has changed relatively quickly and well since the struggle against bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of law and discipline was launched.

Last November, the Zhucheng County Committee of the Communist Party of China successively convened a meeting of county and district cadres and a meeting of county, district, and township cadres. In summarizing and deploying work, the county committee conducted a profound self-criticism of its own bureaucracy and the resulting commandism of district and township cadres, humbly accepted the criticisms of district and township cadres, and formally announced eleven disciplines strictly prohibiting coercive orders to all cadres. The cadres from Changcheng District who attended the meeting further improved their understanding ideologically. Afterwards, with the assistance of the county committee, the district examined the handling of letters from the people and discovered a large number of cases of coercive orders and serious violations of law and discipline. It also handled the case of Ji Xinmin, a military dependent in Daxiaopo Village, who was expelled from the Farmers' Association and had his military dependent status revoked for accusing township and village cadres of concealing black land, and the case of Gao Jianming, the village chief of Dongxingxing Village, who seized land and raped women. This greatly enhanced the understanding of the district committee and the broad masses of cadres regarding the opposition to bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of law and discipline, and strengthened their determination to fight against these bad phenomena. Therefore, from December of last year to January of this year, the district, with the help of the county committee, conducted a widespread and in-depth struggle against bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of law and discipline throughout the district. This was done through cadre meetings, branch general meetings, township people's representative meetings, and democratic township construction work, adopting the methods of top-down, first inside the party and then outside the party, layer-by-layer mobilization, fully developing democracy inside and outside the party, and carrying out criticism and self-criticism. During this period, the district convened two district and township (including village branch secretaries) cadre meetings. Through summarizing and deploying work, a profound review was made of the bureaucracy and coercive orders in the leadership of the district committee and the district government, serious handling of individual district cadres' violations of law and discipline was carried out, and township and village cadres were enlightened to criticize the leadership of the district. In their speeches, township and village cadres exposed many bad people and bad deeds, made sharp criticisms of the district's leadership, and also made self-criticisms of their own mistakes and shortcomings. Subsequently, each township successively convened meetings of party members and members of the Communist Youth League, re-elected the township branch, and eight townships convened township people's representative meetings, re-electing township government members. At these meetings, through summarizing and deploying work, re-electing party branches and township government members, township cadres made profound self-examinations, party and league members made sharp criticisms of the leadership style of the township branch and branch members, and township people's representatives made sharp criticisms of the leadership of the township people's government and the work style of township cadres. In this way, from top to bottom, from inside the party to outside the party, layer by layer, criticism and self-criticism were carried out, so that all district and township cadres, all party and league members, and the broad masses of people received a profound democratic education, and a serious critique was conducted of bureaucracy and coercive commandism. The masses' enthusiasm was extremely high, and their political activism was unprecedentedly enhanced, quickly leaning towards the party. The masses reflected: "Criticism is to educate him (referring to the cadres), as long as they can correct it, we will still elect him." As a result of the re-election of party branches and township governments, only those who violated law and discipline and those who committed serious coercive order errors were not re-elected, and the vast majority of township and village cadres were re-elected by the masses.

However, after rectifying the cadres' work style and vigorously handling bad people and bad deeds, the thought of shrinking back and fearing making mistakes once occurred among the broad masses of district and township cadres, who requested the leadership to provide methods. At this time, according to the instructions of the county committee, the district committee, at a district and township cadre meeting, through summarizing winter work and deploying spring work, in addition to continuing to examine the leadership of the district committee and criticizing commandism and violations of law and discipline, affirmed the achievements of the work, praised good people and good deeds and various model figures, and established the banner of completing tasks using the mass line method. Afterwards, when deploying each task, not only were tasks, policies, and methods explained, but also base points were grasped and examples were produced for district and township cadres to discuss and learn. This corrected the negative emotions of district and township cadres, universally enhanced their confidence, and established the belief that "tasks can be completed without coercive orders."

After several months of efforts, the work style of district, township, and village cadres in the district has undergone significant changes:

1.  In deploying and implementing various spring tasks, the district committee especially emphasized the two tasks of ideological education and effectively grasping base points, cultivated a large number of various typical examples and models, thereby promoting overall work. The district committee took Xilaozhuang Township as a base point, managed by the secretary of the District Committee of the Communist Party and the secretary of the District Committee of the Communist Youth League, and Zhu Miao and Suncun two townships were managed separately by district committee members Cui Xiaoran (District Head) and Liu Yankai (District Armed Forces Minister). Each task was first tested at the base point and then promoted throughout the district. In the spring, the district cultivated and praised a total of twenty-seven model cadres at the district, township, and village levels, and praised three advanced townships, eight villages, and nine mutual aid teams, greatly developing the enthusiasm of cadres and the masses. At the two district, township, and village cadre meetings to deploy spring plowing and production work, the district committee especially emphasized ideological mobilization work, repeatedly explaining the importance of doing a good job in spring plowing and production to ensure a good harvest for the whole year and for national construction. Zheng Zaicheng, the township branch secretary of the base point township, Xilaozhuang Township, introduced the township's experience in promoting the walking plow and chemical fertilizers and the specific plan for completing spring plowing and sowing. The cadres present universally enhanced their confidence in completing the task. Their reaction was "This is really a living example, this time we have a method." Therefore, the district completed the spring plowing work three days ahead of schedule, and ensured that the spring sowing was timely. Now township and village cadres have mastered one village, one group, and one household, and have learned to use typical examples and labor models to promote work in various tasks, which has been very effective.

2.  Grasping spring plowing and production as the central task has driven various tasks. In order to ensure the smooth completion of spring plowing and production tasks, the district committee first strengthened and unified the leadership of various departments, and in spring plowing and sowing, especially grasped the business departments such as supply and marketing cooperatives and banks, so that they would serve spring plowing and production. When deploying spring work, the district committee convened a meeting to make unified arrangements, determining that ideological education work was the responsibility of the district committee, and material supply and technical guidance were the responsibility of the business departments. After the meeting, the district committee unified and organized forces to participate in spring plowing and production, requiring various departments to do a good job in their business work in combination with the central work, thus ensuring the timely supply of materials. At the time of spring plowing and sowing, the county armed forces department deployed militia work, affecting spring plowing and sowing. The district committee immediately requested instructions from the higher authorities to postpone it. This not only ensured the completion of the central task, but also solved the difficulties in the work of the business departments, and overcame the phenomenon of various departments doing business in isolation, without contact with each other, and each going its own way in the past. In implementing various tasks, mutual aid teams were used as the foundation, and ordinary farmers were driven through mutual aid teams. For example, in Xilaozhuang Township, the revision of patriotic covenants and competition movements within the mutual aid teams promoted spring plowing and sowing, promoted the sale of nineteen walking plows and thirteen thousand kilograms of chemical fertilizers, and completed the militia, health, and other tasks in combination.

3.  In leading agricultural production, the district has begun to attach importance to agricultural technical guidance work. At present, most district cadres and the main cadres of townships have learned to use walking plows, chemical fertilizers, waterwheels, and cotton planting technologies, and personally go down to the fields to provide guidance. The district has also specially organized six technicians to impart technology. The masses reflected: "District cadres are also going down to the fields, this is really a change." Technician Zhuang Shutong led the masses to the fields in Xinzhuangzi to experiment with walking plows, breaking the masses' concerns that the walking plow was difficult to hold, not durable, could not be unloaded, could not plant beans, could not dig sweet potato ditches, and livestock could not pull it. Within a month, the district sold eighty-one walking plows and sixty-seven thousand kilograms of chemical fertilizers without any coercive orders.

4.  Some necessary systems have been preliminarily established: District committee members meet about every ten days to study the instructions of higher authorities, report work, study the situation, and specifically introduce the experience of base points. A joint meeting of district cadres or township branch secretaries and township heads, and a meeting of township branch members are convened about every half month, and a meeting of township branch and a meeting of township people’s representatives are convened once a month, mainly to report, summarize, inspect, and deploy work, promote advanced experiences, commend typical models, and rectify work style.

In short, after half a year of the struggle against bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of law and discipline, the district has effectively educated cadres to change the style of coercive orders, so that they have learned the working methods of the mass line. Cadres who were active in their work and had a democratic style in the past were praised and their enthusiasm was even higher; the working ability of ordinary cadres was generally improved, and their confidence in completing tasks with correct working methods was enhanced; cadres who were not active were driven to action after being educated; cadres who were punished can also actively work hard and make meritorious service under the promotion and supervision of the masses, and seek the understanding of the masses through actual transformation. Wang Jinzhuan, the branch secretary of Zhu Miao Township, also worked actively after not being re-elected, personally going down to the fields to lead the masses in hoeing wheat. The masses reflected: "These cadres who used coercive orders have all become better." The masses' enthusiasm for production and sense of responsibility as masters of their own affairs is unprecedentedly high. Farmers who used to be indifferent to township and village work can now actively raise their opinions at the township people's representative meeting and demand discussion and resolution. Some masses directly contact district and township cadres to report the situation and ask district and township cadres to help with work in the village. At the same time, through this struggle, the organization has also been partially purified, and the work of "backward villages" has been carried out. Five "backward villages" have been transformed into advanced villages through this struggle. Daxiaopo Village had not issued land certificates for several years after the land reform. The district had never noticed it in the past, and the masses' production concerns were great. This time, the bad elements were dealt with and the land certificates were issued, and the masses' production enthusiasm and political enthusiasm were very high, and they jointly wrote a letter on red paper to the county people's government, saying: "Thank Chairman Mao, we must strive to become a model village."

    诸城县昌城区的干部转变了工作作风
    山东省诸城县昌城区过去是全县工作开展较慢、干部强迫命令和违法乱纪现象比较严重的一个区，但也是开展反对官僚主义、反对命令主义、反对违法乱纪斗争以来，区、乡干部作风转变较快、较好的一个区。
    去年十一月，中共诸城县委先后召开了一次县、区干部会和一次县、区、乡干部大会，在总结布置工作中，县委对自己的官僚主义以及由此而造成的区、乡干部的命令主义进行了深刻的自我批评，虚心接受了区、乡干部的批评，并向全体干部正式公布严禁强迫命令的十一条纪律。昌城区出席会议的干部在思想上有了进一步的提高。其后，该区又在县委帮助下，检查了处理人民来信的情况，发现了大量的强迫命令事例和严重的违法乱纪事件。并处理了大下坡村军属姬新民因控告乡、村干部隐藏黑地而被开除农会会籍并撤销军属待遇案，和东辛兴村村长高建明霸占土地、奸污妇女案。大大地提高了区委和广大干部对反对官僚主义、命令主义、违法乱纪的认识，坚定了他们和这些坏现象作斗争的决心。因此该区自去年十二月到今年一月，在全区范围内，通过干部会、支部大会、乡人民代表会和民主建乡工作，采取自上而下、先党内后党外、层层带动、充分发扬党内外民主、开展批评与自我批评的方法，广泛深入地开展了反对官僚主义、命令主义、违法乱纪的斗争。这一期间该区曾召开了两次区、乡（包括村支部书记）干部大会，通过总结布置工作，对区委及区公所领导上的官僚主义、强迫命令作了深刻的检讨，对个别区干部违法乱纪事件作了严肃处理，并启发乡、村干部批评了区的领导。乡、村干部在发言中，揭发了许多坏人坏事，对区的领导提出了尖锐的批评，对自身的错误和缺点也作了自我批评。其后，各乡均先后召开了党员、团员大会，改选了乡支部，八个乡召开了乡人民代表会，改选了乡政府委员。在这些会议上，通过总结布置工作，改选党支部和乡政府委员，乡干部均进行了深刻的自我检讨，党、团员对乡支部及支部委员的领导作风，乡人民代表对乡人民政府领导及乡干部的作风均提出了尖锐的批评。这样由上而下、由党内到党外、层层带动，开展了批评与自我批评，使全体区、乡干部和全体党、团员以及广大人民群众均受到了一次深刻的民主教育，对官僚主义、强迫命令作风进行了一次严肃的批判。群众情绪极为高涨，政治积极性空前提高，很快地向党靠拢。群众反映：“批评是为了教育他（指干部），只要能改正，咱还选他。”党支部和乡政府改选的结果，只有违法乱纪分子和犯有严重强迫命令错误的人落选了，绝大多数乡、村干部又被群众重新选上。
    但是，在整顿干部作风和大张旗鼓地处理坏人坏事之后，在广大区、乡干部中，曾一度发生缩手缩脚、怕犯错误的思想，要求领导给办法。这时，区委根据县委的指示，在区、乡干部会议上，通过总结冬季工作，布置春季工作，除继续检查区委领导和批判命令主义、违法乱纪事件外，并肯定了工作成绩，表扬了好人好事和各类模范人物，树立了用群众路线的方法完成任务的旗帜。以后，每布置一件工作时，不仅交代任务、政策、作法，并且都掌握基点，拿出样子，让区、乡干部讨论学习。这样便纠正了区、乡干部的消极情绪，普遍地提高了他们的信心，确立了“不强迫命令能够完成任务”的信念。
    经过几个月的努力，目前该区区、乡、村干部的工作作风已有了显著转变：
    一、在布置和贯彻春季各项工作中，区委特别重视了思想教育和切实掌握基点两项工作，大量培养了各种典型和模范，从而推动了全面工作。区委以西老庄乡为基点，由中共区委书记与青年团区委书记掌握，并由区委委员崔孝然（区长）、刘衍凯（区武装部长）分头掌握朱庙、孙村两个乡。每项工作先在基点试验，然后再在全区推广。春季全区共培养与表扬了区、乡、村各种模范干部二十七人，并表扬了三个先进乡、八个村、九个互助组，大大发扬了干部和群众的积极性。在布置春耕生产工作的两次区、乡、村干部大会上，区委特别强调思想发动工作，反复说明作好春耕生产对保证全年丰收、对国家建设的重要意义，并由基点乡——西老庄乡乡支部书记郑在成介绍了该乡如何推广步犁、化学肥料的经验和如何完成春耕春种的具体计划。到会干部普遍提高了完成任务的信心，他们的反映是“这真是活样子，这回有了办法了”。因此全区提前三天完成了春耕工作，并保证了春种及时。现在乡、村干部均掌握了一村、一组、一户，在各种工作中学会了运用典型和劳动模范推动工作的方法，收效很大。
    二、抓住春耕生产这一中心任务，带动了各项工作。为了保证春耕生产任务顺利完成，区委首先加强与统一了各部门的领导，在春耕春种中特别抓紧了供销社、银行等业务部门，使其为春耕生产服务。布置春季工作时，区委召开会议统一部署，确定思想教育工作由区委负责，物资供应及技术指导由业务部门负责。会后区委又统一组织力量参加春耕生产，要求各部门结合中心工作作好业务工作，因而及时保证了物资供应。在春耕播种时，县武装部布置了民兵工作，影响春耕播种，区委即请示上级，暂缓进行。这样既保证了中心任务的完成，也解决了业务部门工作上的困难，克服了过去各部门孤立搞业务、互不联系、各自为政的现象。在贯彻各项工作中以互助组为基础，通过互助组带动一般农民。如西老庄乡通过互助组内修订爱国公约及竞赛运动，推动了春耕春种，推销了步犁十九部和化学肥料一万三千斤，结合完成了民兵、卫生等项工作。
    三、在领导农业生产方面，该区开始重视了农业技术指导工作。目前大部分区干部和乡的主要干部都学会了使用步犁、化学肥料、水车及植棉等技术，亲自下坡指导。区里还专门组织了技术人员六人，进行技术传授。群众反映：“区干部也下坡了，真是转变了。”技术员庄树同到辛庄子带领群众下坡试验步犁，打破了群众怕步犁不好扶、不长久、不能卸、不能种豆子、不能打地瓜沟、牲口拉不动等等思想顾虑，一个月内全区推销了步犁八十一部和化学肥料六万七千斤，没有发生强迫命令的现象。
    四、初步建立了一些必要的制度：区委委员十天左右集合一次，学习上级指示，汇报工作，研究情况，具体介绍基点经验。半月左右召集一次区干部或乡支部书记、乡长联席会议、乡支部委员会议，一月召集一次乡支部大会和乡人民代表会，主要是汇报、总结、检查、布置工作，推广先进经验，表扬典型模范，整顿作风。
    总之，该区经过半年来，反对官僚主义、命令主义和违法乱纪的斗争，有效地教育干部转变了强迫命令的作风，使他们学会了群众路线的工作方法。过去工作积极、作风民主的干部受到表扬，情绪更加高涨；一般干部的工作能力普遍得到提高，增强了以正确的工作方法完成任务的信心；不积极的干部经过教育之后被带动起来了；受到处分的干部，在群众的推动和监督之下，也能积极努力，立功自赎，从实际转变中求得群众的谅解。朱庙乡支部书记王金专落选后也积极工作，亲自下坡领导群众锄麦子，群众反映：“这些强迫命令的干部都变好了。”群众的生产积极性和主人翁的责任感空前高涨，过去一向不关心乡、村工作的农民，现在也能积极地将自己的意见提到乡人民代表会要求讨论解决，有的群众直接找区、乡干部反映情况，要求区、乡干部到村帮助工作。同时，通过这一斗争，也部分地纯洁了组织，开展了“落后村”的工作。有五个“落后村”经过这一斗争转变为工作先进村。大下坡村土地改革后几年未发土地证，过去区里从未发觉，群众的生产顾虑很大。这次处理了坏分子，颁发了土地证，群众的生产情绪和政治热情很高，联名用红纸写信给县人民政府说：“感谢毛主席，我们一定争取成为模范村。”（原载济南大众日报）
