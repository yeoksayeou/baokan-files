       Henan Wuzhi County Organizes Doctors to Go to the Fields to See Patients During the Busy Farming Season
    Henan Province's Wuzhi County organized doctors to go to the fields to see patients for farmers during the busy farming season. As early as before the wheat harvest, the health centers and public clinics in each district of Wuzhi County began to organize medical teams. More than 30 doctors from the county's public clinics, in addition to adhering to outpatient services, participated in this organization. After the wheat harvest began, each medical team, within its designated area, in addition to general consultations, carried medicines to the fields around noon every day for consultations. Self-employed doctors living in rural areas also voluntarily delineated responsible treatment areas. According to statistics from the first and fifth districts alone, more than 60 self-employed doctors participated in this work. During the medical treatment, all medicines needed by poor farmers were provided free of charge by the county people's government. Due to the strict organization, all diseases that occurred in farmers during the busy farming season throughout the county were treated in a timely manner.
