The meeting opened on May 14 and ended on May 24. On the opening day of the meeting, Commander Chen Yi of the East China Military Region, on behalf of the East China Military Region Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the leaders of the East China Military Region, congratulated the representatives on the great victory of cultural learning.

Twenty-nine representatives of instructors, students, and leading cadres made typical reports at the meeting.

The typical reports delivered at the conference included: Peng Shousheng, Commander of the Nantong Military Sub-district of the Jiangsu Military Region, and Guo Jitian, a student of the East China Military Region Quick Course Middle School who had gone through the Long March. Their spirit of perseverance and hard work fully demonstrated the strong will of veteran cadres of worker-peasant origin who had been tempered for a long time to master culture. Sun Boqi, winner of the East China First-Class People's Hero Medal, not only maintained his honor with his exemplary actions, but also gained new honors in cultural learning, and was rated as a "Model Party Member." Squad Leader Zhang Shaofa of a certain unit on the coastal defense front led a squad to defend a coastal island outpost independently. While completing arduous combat readiness tasks, he overcame all difficulties and led everyone to persist in learning culture.

The deeds of Shi Weihong, a cook of the busy "Luoyang Camp," Zhang Hansan, a naval traffic officer who often went out, and Li Changyou, deputy captain of a certain naval boat who often patrolled the sea, in achieving excellent results in learning, showed that as long as there is determination and attention to promoting the spirit of mutual assistance, learning can be carried out under any circumstances. Tao Wanhe, Zheng Chengzhi, and Zhang Xiukun, literary and artistic soldiers in the style of Gao Yu Bao among the meeting representatives, also reported their moving deeds of hard study and hard writing at the conference. Among the instructor representatives, He Ke, a cultural instructor of a machine gun company in a certain unit, achieved excellent teaching results because of his spirit of wholeheartedly serving the masses and his work style of going deep into reality and contacting the masses, concentrating the wisdom of the masses to overcome difficulties. There were also many instructors like him with such a teaching spirit and creative in-depth study of their profession, such as Yu Yulin, Wu Youhong, Yan Jinqiu, Wang Jinxiang, Zou Yinqiu, and Lin Renhua. Among the cadre representatives leading cultural education work, Jiang Xizhi, an assistant in cultural education of the Logistics Department of the Shandong Military Region, was an excellent cultural and educational cadre who was able to actively study his profession.
