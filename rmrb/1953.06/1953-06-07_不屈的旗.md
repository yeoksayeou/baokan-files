    Unyielding Flag
    Liu Di
    The motherland proudly watches you, watching flag after flag fade
            and then be stained red with blood, flying outside the train window. One arm is sawed off, and there is another,
  as thin as steel, as hard as steel, holding high flag after flag that once fluttered on the island of death,
  flags hidden at the cost of life,
            flags that cannot be searched out! Let the whole world see these flags, let the whole world see our patriots, unyielding warriors, the embodiment of justice! Tanks,
  bayonets,
    electric shocks,
      poison gas bombs,
        flamethrowers, nothing can destroy their will, but some people insist they "refuse repatriation," where can these lies be spread under the eyes of the people of the world? Where can the murderers hide? The motherland proudly watches you,
                my dear brothers! Tears welled up in my eyes, but I really want to run to your side,
  to wipe away your tears for you! Don't move, twisting your new and old wounds, it all hurts like it hurts in my heart! The new wounds were inflicted on the way back, and the old wounds were left in those death camps for two years. ...On those islands of demons, there are tens of thousands more flags of the motherland,
                Unyielding flags! Persist in the struggle! Dear comrades! The motherland opens its arms,
  waiting for the return of its heroic sons and daughters. We,
  your brothers, on the job of building the motherland every day,
  shed one more drop of sweat, so that you shed one less drop of blood, so that these bright red flags
  will guide you back to the sunshine of the motherland one day sooner.

### 不屈的旗

    不屈的旗
    刘砥祖国骄傲地看着你们，看一面一面褪了色
            又被鲜血染红的旗，飞扬在车窗外。一只手臂给锯去了，还有一只，
  钢筋一般瘦，钢筋一般硬，高高举起一面面曾经飘扬在死亡之岛上的旗，
  用生命的代价隐蔽起来的旗，
            搜不完的旗！让全世界看看这些旗吧，让全世界看看我们的爱国者，不屈的勇士，正义的化身！坦克，
  刺刀，
    电刑，
      毒气炸弹，
        火焰喷射器，什么也不能摧毁他们的意志，可是，有人硬说他们“拒绝返国”，在全世界人民的眼睛底下，这些谎话往哪里去撒？凶手往哪里藏？祖国骄傲地看着你们，
                我的亲兄弟！我眼眶里涌起了泪水，可我真想跑到你们身边，
  去替你们擦干眼泪啊！别动吧，扭痛了你们的新伤旧创，都像痛在我心窝一样！新伤是在遣返路上打坏的，旧创是两年来在那些死亡营里留下的。……在那些恶魔的海岛上，还有成万面祖国的旗，
                不屈的旗啊！坚持斗争！敬爱的同志们！祖国张开手臂，
  在等待英勇的儿女归来。我们，
  你们的兄弟，每天在建设祖国的岗位上，
  多流一滴汗，就让你们少流一滴血，就让这些光辉鲜红的旗
  早一天引导你们回到祖国的阳光下。
