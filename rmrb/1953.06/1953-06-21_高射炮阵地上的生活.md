Life on an Anti-Aircraft Gun Emplacement
　　Kang Jun

    One afternoon, I had the opportunity to go to the front line and visit the Third Anti-Aircraft Gun Company again.

    As I walked, I wondered: They fight large formations of enemy planes day and night. The mountaintop has been almost turned over by bombs, and the vegetation has been burned clean. How are they living? I must go and see them!

    After wading across a small river, I reached the foot of the mountain where the Third Company's position was located. From afar, I heard a chorus of songs, interspersed with laughter, and a loud voice like a bronze bell shouting, "One—two!" "One—two!" I thought to myself, these young men are really enjoying themselves! Walking up the hillside, I saw clusters of people everywhere, some repairing the gun emplacements and trenches, others pulling the gun barrels, busy as could be. The one shouting "One—two" was the deputy company commander, who was personally directing the soldiers in cleaning the guns, singing as he led the way:

    Resist America, Aid Korea, hey—yo,
    Not afraid of hardship, hey—yo,
    Sweat drips into the soil, hey—yo,
    Grows grains, hey—yo,
    Blood flows on the ground, hey—yo,
    Opens red flowers, hey—yo.
    Resolutely defeat the American devils, hey—
    yo,
    Defend and build our motherland well, ah yo—.

    I approached them and greeted them: "You're working hard, comrades, how have you been lately?" The deputy company commander turned around, shook my hand, and jokingly stared at me, replying, "Of course we're fine, just look at our group!" I followed his finger and looked, and the comrades cleaning the guns were all wearing green velvet uniforms, their strong muscles flexing powerfully, their young, rosy faces full of energy. If it weren't for the day and night battles and the lack of sleep, their eyes covered in bloodshot veins, it would be hard to believe that these were the people living amidst the burning of thousands upon thousands of tons of American steel. He casually handed me a "Big Front Door" cigarette and, while smoking, led me toward the company headquarters. Halfway there, he suddenly remembered to ask me, "Comrade, do you remember the Battle of Unsan?" I said, "How could I not remember, we were together then!" He paused, as if thinking about something, and then excitedly said, "Right, right, we were together. But now it's not like then, take a look! Take a look!" Because he brought it up, I remembered those hard days when we first went abroad in the winter of 1950. Enemy planes were buzzing overhead all day, making it difficult to move around during the day, so we could only hide in mountain caves and come out at night to strike the enemy. Sometimes we couldn't even wash our faces twice a month, and some people's clothes were worn to shreds. We craved cigarettes so much that we had to rub bean leaves to satisfy our cravings. What kind of life was that? But now, we are using new weapons donated by the people of our motherland, the soldiers have velvet uniforms to wear, "Big Front Door" cigarettes to smoke... "It's changed so fast!" I said to myself. "So fast!" the deputy company commander also said in an excited tone. "Come on, take a look at how our 'artillery battalion' compares to last year's 'immortal's cave'!" He led me along a trench into a spacious shelter, the walls of which were covered with 1:50,000 military maps and New Year pictures donated by the people of the motherland: "Volunteer Army Combat Heroes Tell Victory Stories," "Chengdu-Chongqing Railway Opens to Traffic," "Mutual Aid and Cooperative Farming Yield More Grain, Military Families Live Well," and a particularly eye-catching pair of children holding doves of peace: "We Love Peace!" Every corner was cleaned very well, and the communications soldier had just swept up the dust that had been shaken down by the intense shelling, and now he was repairing the skylight that had been damaged by the bombs. The deputy company commander also pointed to a People's Daily newspaper that was specially posted on the head of the bed and said, "Listen to this: 'If you need people, stand up and go; if you need money or grain, send it immediately!' What a heroic promise! With the motherland behind us, what is there to fear but victory?" Then, he told me in detail that the day before yesterday, the unit had distributed two months' worth of daily necessities, each person receiving a tube of toothpaste, five bars of soap, and three packs of "Big Front Door" cigarettes, and each squad also had more than a dozen packs of fruit candy. As for food and ammunition? That was even less of a problem. Now the company also has stockpiles of tens of thousands of shells and a large amount of refined grain, and the kitchen is piled high with dried vegetables from the Northeast, pickled vegetables from Sichuan, granulated sugar from Tianjin, shredded radish from Jiangxi, peanuts from Shandong, as well as canned goods, salted fish, and egg powder from all over the country... It's truly "full of ammunition, full of grain, people have food, cannons have shells." The deputy company commander laughed heartily as he spoke, full of energy, as if nothing could get the better of this steel fortress. Then he said to me, "Our main gunners haven't known which way their house door opens for more than half a year, and they often sleep without taking off their shoes, the blue sky is their quilt, the yellow earth is their blanket, and the gun legs are their steel spring beds. But after the sanitation campaign was launched, everyone helped each other, and as soon as someone took off their clothes, someone else would take them to wash them. If a bomb shrapnel burned a small hole in a soldier's clothes, he would still mend it neatly. If you tried to persuade him, 'Forget it, fighting a war isn't like living in a big city, attending a meeting, or parading, save your energy!' he would definitely scold you: 'That's not a big deal! The people of the motherland put needles, threads, and pieces of cloth in our pockets, why shouldn't I mend it? I'm still waiting to pass through Tiananmen Square and be inspected by Chairman Mao!'"

    "Some time ago, the regimental headquarters issued each squad a harmonica, but many people still asked people to buy them when they returned home. After fighting all day, they're exhausted, but they still want to jump and sing in the bomb craters, no matter how you say, 'Rest, rest, time is precious.' But they still want to sing and jump, and if they sing, 'We love our motherland, we love our hometown, our future is bright,' they're practically flying!..."

    I was listening with rapt attention. "Report!" A low, husky voice interrupted the excited conversation from outside the door. A comrade wearing a white apron came in and asked the deputy company commander, "Is it time for dinner?" At this time, we realized that it was already dusk outside. The deputy company commander asked, "Is it ready? Old Wang, where did you set up the pot today?" Old Wang said, "In the Wind Ridge Stone Gorge, this time it's safe, no matter how many firecrackers (referring to bombing and strafing) the American devils set off, we won't move." Going outside, the deputy company commander introduced, "This is our cook squad leader, a truly warm-hearted and fiery person, he can melt snow with his warmth, and if the rice is a little cold, it's like freezing his heart. The other day, a bomb overturned the marching pot, affecting a meal and preventing the fire from being lit. When it was time for lunch, the cook squad leader didn't want to lift the lid of the pot, and almost shed tears before stammering, 'It's all my fault for not doing a good job, everyone... everyone overcome the difficulties!' Later, when the lid was lifted, it turned out that there were quite a few leftover steamed buns from the morning. 'You see,' the deputy company commander said with a smile. 'Now eating cold buns is considered 'overcoming difficulties'!" Turning around, he jokingly said to Old Wang, "Are we still 'overcoming difficulties' today?" Old Wang blushed embarrassedly and said, "No, today it's rice, but there's some leftover sorghum rice from the last meal. We've already had a meeting and made a self-criticism, and we guarantee that we won't eat leftovers again in the future."

    After a whistle sounded, the position became busy with getting rice and distributing dishes. After a while, I noticed that people were all gathered around the sorghum rice bucket, but urging others to scoop rice. A new comrade with a Hunan accent snatched the squad leader's bowl and added rice to it, but ate sorghum rice himself. The squad leader resolutely refused, and the two argued back and forth. I asked him, "Are you used to eating sorghum rice?" He said with a straight face, "This stuff is already rare now, if you don't eat it now, you won't get it in the future!" The comrades were amused by this and burst into laughter. At this time, I had an unspeakable feeling in my heart, and the great optimistic image and noble language of these comrades were deeply engraved in my mind forever. It is they who would rather endure hardship themselves and strive for the happiness of others, and who would not hesitate to pave the way for the advancement of the motherland with their own lives; and it is they who can understand life and know how to live it, and who can truly enjoy the most pleasant life in the world. I thought, standing there blankly, when suddenly the deputy company commander pointed to the tofu stewed with salted fish in the dish basin in front of me and said, "We have everything, it's just a pity that we lack green vegetables!" Then, he quickly added:

    "It doesn't matter, we have a solution." He pointed to the black soil on the hillside that had been turned over by the bombs and said, "The American devils have cleared the land for us, good, tomorrow we'll sow seeds, plant small Chinese cabbage, plant green onions, plant carrots..." I asked him in surprise, "How long are you going to be stationed here?" He answered calmly, "Don't worry, as long as Korea is at peace, when we return to our country, there will still be Korean people here! Are you afraid that no one will eat them?" I excitedly grabbed his hand and shook it: "Good, you really know how to live, you live so happily!" He said, "It's not that we know how to live, but that the motherland makes us live such a happy life."

    高射炮阵地上的生活
    亢君
    一天下午，我有机会走上前线，第二次再到高射炮三连去。
    我一边走一边想：他们不分昼夜地和大队敌机作战。山头被炸弹炸得几乎翻了过来，草木都烧了个精光。他们究竟生活得怎么样呢？赶紧去看看他们吧！
    涉过了一条小河就到了三连阵地的山脚下。远远听见一片歌声，不时夹杂着喧笑，还有一个高嗓门如铜钟一样地呼喊：“一——二！”“一——二！”我心里想，这些小伙子们真有个乐劲啊！走上山坡一看，这一簇那一簇尽是人啦，有的修补炮掩体、交通壕，有的拉炮膛，忙得不可开交。喊“一——二”的是副连长，他正亲自指挥战士们擦炮，一边喊还一边领着唱：
    抗美援朝咳——哟，
    不怕累呀咳——哟，
    汗滴入土咳——哟，
    生五谷哪咳——哟，
    血流在地咳——哟，
    开红花呀咳——哟。
    坚决打败美国鬼哪咳——，
    保卫祖国建设好啊哟——。
    我走近向他们打招呼：“辛苦啦，同志们，近来好啊？”副连长翻身一看，忙和我拉了拉手，玩笑似地瞪着眼睛回答说：“当然好，你瞧瞧咱们这伙人！”我顺着他的手指望去，擦炮的同志们一色穿着绿绒衣，结实的筋肉有力地颤动着，一个个年青红润的脸庞神采飞扬，要不是因为昼夜鏖战，睡眠太缺，眼球上罩满了血丝，简直使你难以相信，这就是生活在燃烧着成千成万吨美国钢铁中的人们。他随手递过一枝“大前门”烟来，边抽边拉着我向连指挥所走。半路上他忽然想起来问我：“同志，你还记得打云山吗？”我说：“怎么不记得，咱们在一起呀；”他停了停，好像在想什么，后来又兴奋地说：“对，对，咱们在一起。不过，现在不是那时候了，你看看吧！你看看吧！”由于他的提起，我想起一九五○年冬天刚出国时那些艰苦的日子，敌机整天在头上轰轰地飞，白天很难活动，只能掩蔽在山洞里，晚上才出来打击敌人。有时一个月也顾不上洗两次脸，有的人衣服都磨飞了花。想抽烟想的不行，只好揉把豆叶解解馋。那是什么样的生活；可是现在，我们使用祖国人民捐献的新式武器了，战士们有绒衣穿，有“大前门”抽……“变得真快！”我自言自语说。“真快！”副连长也带着兴奋的口吻说。“来吧，你看看咱们的‘炮兵营’比前年的‘神仙洞’如何？”他领我顺着交通沟走进了一个宽畅的掩蔽部，里面四壁挂满了五万分之一的军用地图和祖国人民捐赠的新年画：有“志愿军战斗英雄讲胜利故事”，有“成渝铁路通车”，有“互助代耕多打粮，军属生活过得强”，还有一付特别惹人注目的两个抱着和平鸽的小囝囝：“我们热爱和平！”各个角落收拾得很干净，通讯员刚刚打扫过由于猛烈炮击震落下来的尘土，现在他正修理着被炸弹震坏了的天窗。副连长又指着一张特意贴在床头上的人民日报说：“你听听：‘要人，站起来就走；要钱，要粮，马上就送！’多么豪壮的诺言！祖国，有了它，还怕没有胜利？”接着，他详细地告诉我，前天部队配发了两个月的日用品，每个人能摊上一瓶牙膏，五块肥皂，三条“大前门”烟，每班还另有十几包水果糖。至于粮食、弹药呢？那就更不成问题。现在连队还库存着成千上万发的炮弹，和大批的细粮，伙房内堆满了东北的干菜，四川的榨菜，天津的砂糖，江西的萝卜丝，山东的花生米，还有来自祖国各地的罐头、咸鱼、鸡蛋粉……真是“弹满库，粮满仓，人有饭，炮有弹”。副连长说着哈哈大笑起来，显得浑身是劲，好像任何意外都把他们这个钢铁阵地奈何不得一样。接着他又对我说：“我们的主要炮手半年多都不知道房子门向那开了，睡觉常不脱鞋，天是蓝被，地是黄毯，炮脚是钢丝床，可是卫生运动开展以后，大家都互相帮助，刚脱下来的衣服别人拿着就给洗了，炊事班挨排地向战斗人员要衣服洗。炸弹片在战士们的衣服上烧了个小窟窿，他也要补整齐，你劝他说：‘算了吧，打仗又不是住大城市、开会、游行，省点劲吧！’他准刺你一顿：‘那费啥事！祖国人民从衣袋里放了针线布块，为啥不补？我还等着过天安门受毛主席检阅哩！’
    “前些时团部发给每班一把口琴，但是很多人仍要托人回国买。打一天仗累的要死，他们还要在炸弹坑上跳啊，唱啊，任你怎么说：‘休息吧，休息吧，时间难得。’可是还要唱，跳，要是唱到‘我们爱祖国，我们爱家乡，我们的前途万丈光芒’，简直像要飞起来一样！……”
    我正听得入神。“报告！”门外一个低哑的粗声打断了兴奋的谈话。随着进来一个穿白围裙的同志，问副连长：“开饭吧？”这时，我们才发觉外面已经是昏苍苍的了。副连长问：“做好了？老王，今天把锅支在哪儿啦？”老王说：“风岭山石峡里，这回可保险了，美国鬼子再放多少鞭炮（指轰炸扫射）咱们也不搬家了。”走出去，副连长介绍说：“这是我们的炊事班长，真是个热肠子火性人，是雪他也要把它暖化，饭要是冷一点就像是冻了他的心。那天一颗炸弹炸翻了行军锅，影响了一顿点不着火，等开中饭的时候，炊事班长怎么也不愿掀桶盖，最后几乎流出了眼泪，才吞吞吐吐嘟哝着：“都怪我没搞好，大家……大家克服点困难吧！”后来揭开桶盖一看，原来是不少早上剩的包子。“你瞧，”副连长笑着说。“现在咱们吃凉包子都算是‘克服困难’了！”转过来，他又打趣老王说：“咱们今天是不是还‘克服困难’？”老王不好意思地红着脸说：“不啦，今天大米饭，只是上顿还剩些高粱米。我们已经开过会，做了检讨，保证今后不再吃剩饭。”
    一声哨音响后，阵地上打饭、分菜忙了起来。过了一会，我发觉人们尽围着高粱米饭桶转，却劝别人去盛大米。有一个湖南口音的新同志夺过班长的碗来添上大米饭。而自己却吃高粱米，班长坚决不要，两人争来夺去。我问他说：“高粱米你吃得惯吗？”他绷着脸一本正经地说：“这玩意，现在就已经不多见了，现在不吃点，将来就捞不着啦！”同志们被他这一逗，弄得哄地一阵笑起来。这时，在我心里有种说不出的滋味，脑子里永不磨灭地深深刻下了这些同志们伟大的乐观形象和高贵的语言。就是他们，宁肯自己吃苦，而力求别人幸福，不惜用自己的生命铺平祖国前进的道路；也正是他们，才能够懂得生活和知道如何生活，才能够真正享受到人间最愉快的生活。我想着，呆呆地站着，忽然副连长指着面前菜盆里的豆腐熬咸鱼说：“什么都有，可惜青菜太缺了！”随后，忙又接着说：
    “不要紧，我们有办法。”他又指着山坡上被炸弹翻过来的黑土说：“美国鬼子给咱们开了荒，好，明天撒下种子，种小白菜，种大葱，种胡萝卜……”我惊奇地问他说：“你们要在这里蹲多久呀？”他坦然地回答：“不怕，只要朝鲜和平了，咱们回了国，还有朝鲜老百姓呀！还怕没人吃它？”我激动地抓着他的手摇撼着：“好，你们真会过，你们生活得真愉快！”他说：“不是我们会过，而是祖国使我们过这样愉快的生活。”
