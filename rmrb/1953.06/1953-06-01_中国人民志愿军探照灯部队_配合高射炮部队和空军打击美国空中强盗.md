Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 29th. Frontline reporter Xie Zhilin reports: The Chinese People's Volunteer Army's searchlight unit actively cooperates with anti-aircraft artillery units and air force units to strike American air pirates.

The searchlight unit is a battle-experienced branch of the Volunteer Army and a powerful assistant to our night fighter and anti-aircraft artillery units in night air combat. The searchlight unit cooperated with our night fighter and anti-aircraft artillery units to shoot down and damage many enemy aircraft in night air combat. The sixth company of a certain searchlight unit once illuminated all eleven B-29 heavy bombers that came to bomb our Jiangqiao bridge late one night. At that time, our night fighter jets patrolling in the night sky immediately fired fiercely at these enemy planes exposed in the strong light beams. Three enemy planes were shot down and one was damaged.

After the enemy's night bombers suffered increasingly heavy blows, they strengthened the activities of night jet planes, attempting to use these aircraft to attack our searchlight positions. But the enemy's night jet planes also suffered fatal blows. For example, on the evening of April 18, after an enemy F-80 night jet plane was illuminated by our searchlight over a certain Jiangqiao bridge, it scurried around in the night sky, trying to escape the tight light net with high-speed flight. But wherever the enemy plane flew, several strong searchlight beams followed closely. When our anti-aircraft artillery opened fire, the enemy plane was shot down.

    配合高射炮部队和空军打击美国空中强盗
    【新华社朝鲜前线二十九日电】本社前线记者谢芝麟报道：中国人民志愿军探照灯部队积极配合高射炮部队和空军部队打击美国空中强盗。
    探照灯部队是志愿军一个富有战斗经验的兵种，是我夜航战斗机和高射炮部队的夜间对空作战的有力助手。探照灯部队配合我军夜航战斗机和高射炮部队在夜间对空作战中击落击伤了许多敌机。我探服灯某部第六连曾在一天深夜把前来轰炸我方江桥的十一架B—29型重轰炸机全部照住。当时在夜空中巡逻的我军夜航战斗机，立即向着这些暴露在强烈光柱中的敌机猛烈射击。敌机被打落了三架、打伤了一架。
    敌人的夜航轰炸机受到了日益沉重的打击以后，加强了夜航喷气机的活动，企图用这种飞机来攻击我军的探照灯阵地。但是敌人的夜航喷气机也同样遭到了致命的打击。如四月十八日晚上，一架敌F—80型夜航喷气机在某江桥上空被我军探照灯光照住以后，就在夜空中到处飞窜，想用高速度的飞行来逃脱严密的光网。但敌机飞到那里，好几道强烈的探照灯光也紧跟着照到那里。当我军高射火器开火的时候，这架敌机就被打下来了。
