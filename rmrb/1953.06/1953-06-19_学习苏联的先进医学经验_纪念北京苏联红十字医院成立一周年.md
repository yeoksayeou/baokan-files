Learning from the Advanced Medical Experience of the Soviet Union
——Commemorating the First Anniversary of the Founding of the Beijing Soviet Red Cross Hospital
Zhu Zhongli, Dai Zhengqi, Vice Presidents of the Beijing Soviet Red Cross Hospital

Today is the first anniversary of the founding of the Beijing Soviet Red Cross Hospital. Over the past year, under the leadership of Director Frolov, all the Soviet experts at the Beijing Soviet Red Cross Hospital have made great contributions to the health and happiness of the Chinese people.

In the past year, the hospital has treated 65,880 outpatients, admitted 628 inpatients, conducted lung tuberculosis examinations for 12,450 students, citizens, and cadres, and made more than 200 external consultations. In addition, the experts have also helped us prevent and treat tuberculosis and participated in the work of the industrial and mining tuberculosis prevention and control training class organized by the Central Ministry of Health; they have also continuously received visitors and observers from various fields. From the date of its establishment last year to April of this year, the hospital received more than 7,000 letters from the people regarding medical and other issues, and we have tried our best to respond to them. Therefore, the people of the whole country have expressed great concern and care for our hospital.

Over the past year, the advanced medical experience of the Soviet Union has helped us solve many difficult diseases. Soviet experts not only introduced advanced medical theories and technologies but also applied the basic principles of Pavlov's theory in practice. They regard the human body as an organic whole, believing that diseases are not limited to invading a certain part but involve the activities of the entire organism; higher nervous activity plays an important role in the activities of the organism, especially in the occurrence of and fight against diseases. Many causes of diseases have been correctly explained by this, and the treatment methods are therefore different from the past. Many difficult diseases have been solved by Soviet experts with rich experience and outstanding skills. For example, sleep therapy with protective inhibition, blocking therapy to cut off the centripetal pathways of pathological conditioned reflexes, and dietary therapy have been applied to gastric ulcers; in addition, neurosis has been explained and treated with Pavlov's theory. In the acute phase, in order to give the patient's cerebral cortex a rest, their living environment is changed, and their work is stopped, and systemic strengthening therapy is also adopted; in order to restore and adjust the dynamic process of higher nervous activity, Pavlov's prescription is used symptomatically, and physical therapy is performed. In addition, language in the second signal system is used as a treatment method. In this way, many patients have received good results. This is completely opposite to the idealist Freudian school.

For optic nerve atrophy, neurotic retinitis, and other diseases, Soviet experts have adopted tissue therapy and systemic therapy, with good results, restoring the vision of more than 40% of patients to a considerable extent.

The Department of Dermatology not only adopts local treatment but also pays more attention to mental therapy and uses nerve-protective agents and nerve tonics, with equally good results. For example, Huang Yongshan, who had suffered from skin tuberculosis for more than 20 years, was cured after more than four months of treatment.

The Department of Otolaryngology used Lovocaine blockade therapy to treat diseases that were previously considered to require surgery or cauterization, such as chronic hypertrophic rhinitis.

The Department of Pediatrics also emphasized the importance of nutrition and stressed breastfeeding for infants. In the treatment of certain diseases, such as chronic lung inflammation, in addition to special therapies, blood therapy, which has a strengthening effect on the body, is often used.

In the diagnosis and classification of tuberculosis, the nature and extent of local lesions, as well as compensatory function and sputum bacteria shedding, are taken into consideration. Physical therapy, which focuses on the entire body, is also used in treatment; from the same point of view, in the diagnosis of X-rays, the photos are not viewed in isolation, but are considered in conjunction with clinical symptoms.

Physical therapy has played a great role in clinical practice and has significant effects on neurosis, bronchial asthma, gynecological inflammation, chronic arthritis, sequelae of infantile paralysis, and sinusitis. For example, Ding Baosan, a pediatric patient, could not move his lower limbs, but was able to walk after four ion therapies; another woman named Tang suffered from gynecological inflammation, resulting in infertility, but became pregnant after physical therapy. There are many such examples, and they will not be listed one by one here. In capitalist countries, physical therapy is not valued because it is not as profitable as drugs.

In hospital management, the experts also applied Pavlov's theory and implemented the concept of "everything for the patient," creating many superior systems.

According to Pavlov's theory, the surrounding environment has an important impact on the patient's mental activity, which in turn has a great effect on treatment. Therefore, the hospital's environment and furnishings are designed to make patients feel as happy and relaxed as possible. A dining room is set up for patients who can move, with chess, cards, books, and newspapers in the room. Gardens and stone tables with umbrellas are set up in the courtyard for patients to enjoy, read, and relieve boredom, making them feel similar to daily family life.

The all-hospital morning meeting every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday is an important system (only 30 minutes long). At the meeting, the doctor on duty reports on the sanitation, diet, and other aspects of all patients in the hospital. Personnel from all departments can freely speak about problems in their work, and the director makes a summary at the end. Through the morning meeting, we can understand the situation in time and solve problems. In addition to the all-hospital morning meeting, each department also holds a small morning meeting for 30 minutes every Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday, presided over by the head of the department, to understand and solve the problems of the department in time.

The pharmacy management system stipulates that the prepared medicine must be strictly checked by the inspector before it is issued to avoid errors. The management of highly toxic drugs is even stricter, and only certain personnel can open the medicine cabinet.

The Department of Radiology has established a machine maintenance system: the machine must be checked every day before starting work; there is a "technical day" once a month, on which all machines are overhauled to prevent machine failures.

Nutrition is highly valued because it plays a big role in treatment. Patients' diets are divided into ten categories according to their needs. Nutrition doctors often solicit patients' opinions to improve their work; the doctor on duty every day must go to the kitchen to check the cleanliness and hygiene, and taste various meals himself. Only qualified meals can be sent to patients.

Patients' opinions are highly valued. Comrades in the ward work group often go to the wards to contact patients. Patients are divided into groups by ward, and a group leader is selected. All group leaders in the hospital meet once a week to reflect patients' opinions and solve problems in their recuperation. This connects the hospital leadership with the patients.

Soviet experts often say: "A medical worker should also be a health propagandist and organizer." Therefore, regular health education for patients has become a regular system. In the wards, doctors give a lecture on popular health knowledge once a week. In the outpatient department, the doctor on duty conducts popular health education for patients during waiting time.

Soviet experts believe that cleanliness and quiet are inviolable conditions, and every staff member must strictly maintain them.

The above-mentioned scientific management system is of great benefit to the hospital's medical work. This shows that Soviet medicine is not only advanced in theory and technology, but also superior in management methods and systems.

In their work, Soviet experts showed a socialist work attitude, serving patients wholeheartedly with a selfless spirit.

In treatment, Soviet experts adopt a serious and responsible attitude towards the patient's body. They never easily decide to amputate any part of the patient's body. They believe that the measurement of a doctor's skill and experience is not to see what he can cut off, but to see if he can preserve and restore the precious organism. For example, Li Fengqi, a dental patient, suffered from a benign fibrous osteoma of the upper jaw. He had been treated in other hospitals, and the doctor said that half of the upper jaw must be removed. However, after diagnosis by Soviet experts, it was believed that only the osteoma site needed to be removed for him. This would prevent the patient from spending his next decades with a serious disability. The leg of patient Wang Huizhang, who suffered from skin tuberculosis, was cut off by a doctor in a certain hospital, but tuberculosis reappeared on his face. After diagnosis by Soviet experts in dermatology, the error of this treatment was discovered. Huang Yongshan, a patient with the same skin tuberculosis, has been cured after expert treatment. For neurotic dermatitis, Soviet experts advocate systemic therapy and protective inhibition therapy; for chronic tonsillitis (especially in children), surgery should be avoided as much as possible, and penicillin should be used for washing first; in surgery, local anesthesia is widely used, thus avoiding the dangers and complications of general anesthesia or lumbar anesthesia. Soviet surgical experts have successfully performed thoracic surgery using local anesthesia (one was a pulmonary hydatid cyst, and the other was a gastroesophageal anastomosis). These examples illustrate the noble medical ethics of Soviet experts.

In terms of leadership methods, Director Frolov and Deputy Director Khokhalova often say: "Our work should not be limited to the office, but should go to the wards and outpatient clinics, and also personally check medical records and talk to patients." Indeed, they not only arrange work, but also personally go down to check and understand the situation of the whole hospital, and help each department solve difficulties in time. Their requirements for work are strict, and they oppose sloppy work styles. They are very serious and meticulous about everything, big or small. For example, in planning the construction of a new hospital and ordering furniture, Comrade Frolov always asked us to consider China's current economic situation and try to be streamlined and economical. He said: "If we waste a penny of China's money, it is equivalent to investing one penny less in industry, which will affect China's economic construction."

Soviet experts are full of unparalleled enthusiasm and a high degree of responsibility for patients. Some Soviet experts often write reports or papers on holidays; sometimes they are sick, but they still insist on working as usual.

Soviet surgical experts often go out for consultations during meal times, not afraid of hard work.

Soviet internal medicine experts often educate our young doctors: "Don't make the patient feel that you are a staff member, but make him feel that you are his friend." Once, on a Sunday, a Soviet expert braved the scorching heat to take care of a patient with an asthma attack. When someone asked him why he cared so much about the patient, he replied, "Being a doctor is not just about writing a prescription, but also about understanding the patient's mental situation and relieving his mental pain."

Soviet experts in dermatology have also said to Chinese doctors more than once: "The doctor's language is a therapeutic factor. We must love patients and have no right to let patients leave us disappointed or angry." Once, a dermatology patient got vitiligo, and there was no specific medicine for treatment. He patiently explained to the patient and told him what to do. Finally, he shook the patient's hand and said, "Please rest assured that this disease has no effect on health or life. You can live with it for a hundred years." So the patient smiled and left happily.

Soviet head nurses and nurses in various departments treat patients as warmly and considerately as their own relatives. Soviet experts in the general affairs department also treat their work with a serious and earnest attitude, establishing a system for the issuance, storage, and compensation of items, and mobilizing everyone to use waste products to make useful equipment.

Soviet experts not only care about the patients' illnesses, but also care about their lives. Soviet experts in neurology sometimes personally help patients walk, helping them practice walking; when they recover, they even personally arrange their studies and work after discharge.

Soviet experts have made the greatest efforts to cultivate and educate Chinese comrades. And we have also shown great enthusiasm for learning advanced Soviet medicine. Last December, with the help of Soviet experts, we conducted intensive Russian language learning and obtained the weapon of learning Soviet experience. All staff members are very serious in completing any work assigned by Soviet experts. Reviewing the work of the past year, we have taken some detours and there are still many shortcomings in our work. For example, many comrades have acute illnesses and hope that Soviet experts will teach them a complete set of techniques at once, so they lack a spirit of research. In the future, we will work harder to strengthen the unity between Chinese and Soviet personnel in the hospital and strive to realize the glorious task of learning and disseminating advanced Soviet medicine and ensuring the health of the Chinese people!

    学习苏联的先进医学经验
    ——纪念北京苏联红十字医院成立一周年
    北京苏联红十字医院副院长  朱仲丽  戴正启
    今天是北京苏联红十字医院成立一周年纪念日。一年来北京苏联红十字医院全体苏联专家在院长甫罗哈洛夫的领导下，为中国人民的健康、幸福献出了很大的力量。
    一年来，医院给六万五千八百八十个门诊患者进行了治疗，收容住院病人六百二十八人，为一万二千四百五十个学生、市民和干部作了肺结核检查，外出会诊二百余次。另外，专家还帮助我们防治结核，参加了中央卫生部开办的工矿防痨训练班的工作；不断地接待了各方面的访问者和参观者。从去年成立之日起至今年四月止，医院共收到人民关于医疗等问题的来信七千余件，也尽量作了答复。因此，全国人民对我们医院表示了极大的关怀和爱护。
    一年来，苏联先进的医学经验给我们解决了很多疑难疾病。苏联专家们不仅介绍了先进的医学理论和技术，并在实践中运用了巴夫洛夫学说的基本观点。他们把人体当作一个有机的整体，认为疾病不仅限于侵犯某一局部，而且涉及于整个机体的活动；高级神经活动在机体的活动上，特别在对疾病的发生和斗争上，起着重要作用。许多病因，由此得到正确的解释，治疗方法因之也不同于过去。许多疑难疾病在具有丰富经验和卓越技术的苏联专家的手下得到了解决。例如，对胃溃疡施行了具有保护性阻抑作用的睡眠疗法、切断病理性条件反射向心经路的封闭疗法以及食饵疗法；此外以巴夫洛夫学说解释并治疗了神经症，在急性期，为了使患者的大脑皮质得到休息，更换他的生活环境，并停止他的工作，又采用了全身强壮疗法；为了恢复和调整高级神经活动的动力过程，对症地使用了巴夫洛夫处方，进行了物理疗法，另外还用第二信号系统中的语言作为治疗的方法。这样许多病人收到了良效。这是和唯心主义的弗洛易德学派完全相反的。
    对于视神经萎缩、神经性网膜炎等病，苏联专家们采用了组织疗法和全身疗法，效果良好，使百分之四十以上的病人的视力恢复到相当程度。
    皮肤科不仅采用局部治疗，更注意到精神治疗法，并使用神经保护性药剂、神经强壮剂，效果同样良好。例如患皮肤结核已二十多年的黄永山，经四个多月的治疗，得到了痊愈。
    耳鼻科用卢弗卡因封闭疗法，治疗了过去认为必须动手术或烧灼的疾病，如慢性肥厚性鼻炎等。
    小儿科也着重地提出了营养的重要性，并强调小儿的母乳喂养。在治疗某些疾病时如肺部慢性炎症，除了特殊疗法外，常常采用具有强壮机体作用的血液疗法。
    结核病的诊断分类上，兼顾到局部病灶的性质、范围以及代偿机能和痰内排菌情况，治疗上也采用了从整个机体着眼的体育疗法；从同一观点出发，在X光的诊断方面，不是孤立地看照片，而是结合临床症状来考虑的。
    物理疗法在临床上起了很大的作用，对神经症、支气管喘息、妇科炎症、慢性关节炎、小儿麻痹后遗症和副鼻窦炎等，都有显著效果。如儿科患者丁保三，下肢不能行动，经四次离子疗法以后即能步行；又有一个姓唐的女子患妇科炎症，因而不孕，在用物理疗法以后，怀了孕。像这样的例子有许多，这里不去一一列举了。而在资本主义国家，物理疗法是不被重视的，因为它不如药物有利可图。
    在医院的管理上，专家们同样运用了巴夫洛夫的学说和贯彻一切为了病人的观点，创立了许多优越的制度。
    根据巴夫洛夫的学说，周围环境对病人的精神活动有着重要的影响，从而对治疗也有很大作用。因此，医院的环境陈设都尽量使病人感到愉快轻松。为能行动的病人设立了饭厅，室中有棋、牌、书报，院中设花园、带伞的石桌以供病人玩赏、阅览，帮助病人解除苦闷，使他们感到和日常家庭生活相似。
    每星期一、三、五的全院朝会，是一个重要的制度（只开三十分钟）。会上，由值班大夫报告有关全院病人卫生、饮食等方面的情况。各科、各部门的人员都可对工作中的问题自由发言，最后由院长作总结。通过朝会可以及时了解情况，解决问题。除全院性的朝会外，各科于每星期二、四、六也以三十分钟的时间，由科主任主持举行小朝会，及时了解和解决本科的问题。
    药房管理制度上，规定在调好的药剂发出之前，要经过检查员的严格检查，以免发生错误。剧毒药的管理，更为严格，只有一定人员才能启开药箱。
    放射线科订立了机器护理制度：每日检查机器以后才能开始工作；每月有一次“技术日”，在这一天对全部机器进行大修检，以防机器发生故障。
    营养是十分被重视的，因为它在治疗上起着很大的作用。病人的饮食根据需要分为十类。营养大夫经常征求病人的意见，以改进工作；每日值班大夫要到厨房检查清洁卫生情况，亲口尝各种膳食，合格的才能送给病人。
    对病人的意见是十分重视的。病房工作组的同志，经常到病房里去和病人接触。病人按病房划分小组，选出小组长。全院小组长每周开会一次，反映病人的意见，解决休养中的问题。这样便把医院领导方面和病人联系起来了。
    苏联专家常说：“一个医务工作者，应该同时是卫生宣传者、组织者。”因此，对病人经常进行卫生教育已经形成经常的制度。在病房里，每周由医生讲一次通俗的卫生常识，门诊则由值班大夫于候诊时间定时向病人进行通俗的卫生教育。
    苏联专家认为，清洁和肃静是不可破坏的条件，每一个工作人员必须严格保持。
    上述的科学的管理制度，对医院的医疗工作都有很大的好处。这说明苏联医学不仅在理论上、技术上是先进的，就是在管理方法、制度上也是优越的。
    在工作中，苏联专家们表现了社会主义的劳动态度，他们以忘我的精神全心全意为病员服务。
    在治疗上，苏联专家对病人的机体采取严肃负责的态度，他们决不轻易决定截除病人身体的任何一部分。他们认为：测量一个医生的技术的好坏、经验的多少，不是看他会切除什么，而是看他会不会保存和恢复珍贵的机体。例如，牙科患者李凤岐患上颔骨良性纤维骨瘤，曾在其他医院医治，医生说必须将半侧颔骨切除。然而，经苏联专家诊断，认为只要给他切除骨瘤部位。这样就不致于使患者带着严重的残缺度过他往后几十年的岁月。病人王慧章因皮肤结核被某一医院的医生割去了腿，但结核在面部又出现了。经皮肤科苏联专家诊断，发现了这种疗法的错误。患同样皮肤结核的病人黄永山，经专家治疗，已经痊愈。对神经性皮肤炎，苏联专家主张采用全身疗法和保护性阻抑疗法；对慢性扁桃腺炎
    （尤其对小儿患者）尽量避免手术，先用青霉素洗涤；在外科方面广泛运用局部麻醉，因而避免了全身麻醉或腰椎麻醉的危险和合并症。苏联外科专家曾成功地运用局部麻醉作了胸腔手术（一是肺包虫，一是胃食道吻合术）。这些例子都说明了苏联专家的高尚的医疗道德。
    在领导方法上，甫罗哈洛夫院长和霍哈洛娃副院长常说：“我们的工作不应该限制在办公室里，应当到病房和门诊处去，还要亲自检查病历，亲自和病人谈话。”的确，他们不仅布置工作，而且亲自到下边去检查，了解全院情况，并及时帮助各科解决困难。他们对工作的要求是严格的，反对粗枝大叶的工作作风。他们无论对大小事情都非常认真，一丝不苟。例如，在计划建筑新的医院和定购家具等问题上，甫罗哈洛夫同志总是要求我们考虑到中国目前的经济情况，尽量做到精简节约。他说：“如果我们浪费中国一分钱，就等于在工业上少投资一分钱，便会影响到中国的经济建设。”
    苏联专家们对病人充满了无比的热情和高度的负责精神。有一些苏联专家，常常在例假日写报告或论文；有时他们病了，还照常坚持工作。
    苏联外科专家也经常在吃饭的时间出外会诊，不辞劳苦。
    苏联内科专家常常教育我们年青的医生：“不要叫病人感觉你是一个工作人员，而要使他感觉你是他的朋友。”有一次，在星期日，苏联专家冒着炎暑，去照顾一个气喘发作的病人。有人问他为什么这样关心病人，他回答说：“作一个医生不只是开开处方就算了，还要了解病人的思想情况，解除他精神上的痛苦。”
    皮肤科的苏联专家也不只一次地对中国医生说：“医生的语言是治疗的因子，我们要热爱病人，没有权利使病人失望或气愤地离开我们。”有一次，皮肤科病人得了白癜疯，没有特效药治疗，他耐心地向病人解释，告诉他应该怎样办。最后，他握着病人的手说：“请放心，这病对健康、生命都无影响，你可以带着他活一百年。”于是病人笑了，愉快地离去了。
    各科苏联护士长和护士对待病人像亲人般地亲热和体贴，总务科的苏联专家也是以严肃认真的态度来对待自己的工作，创立了物品领发保管赔偿制度，发动大家利用废品做成有用的器具。
    苏联专家们不但关心病人们的病，也关心他们的生活。神经科的苏联专家有时亲自扶着病人行走，帮助他们练习走路；在病愈时，甚至亲自给他们安排出院后的学习和工作问题。
    对中国同志的培养教育，苏联专家们尽了最大的努力。而我们对学习苏联的先进医学，也表现了极大的热情。去年十二月，我们在苏联专家帮助下进行了俄文速成学习，获得了学习苏联经验的武器。全体工作人员都是非常认真地完成苏联专家分配的任何工作。检查过去一年的工作，我们是走过一些弯路的，工作上也还存在着不少缺点。例如，许多同志有急性病，希望苏联专家一下子教会成套的技术，因而缺乏钻研的精神。今后，我们将更加努力，加强院内中苏两国工作人员的团结，为实现学习和传播苏联先进医学，保障中国人民健康的光荣任务而奋斗！（附图片）
