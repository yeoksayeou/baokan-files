Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, June 26th: The Austrian Communist Party's organ, "Volksstimme," published a commentary stating that the real purpose of Syngman Rhee's recent provocative actions is to undermine the armistice.

The paper said, "The Americans are pretending that they didn't know about this trick in advance, but no one will believe that. The whole world already knows that Syngman Rhee is frightened by peace, and the whole world also knows his attempts to forcibly detain prisoners of war." The paper condemned the U.S. for not taking any measures to force Syngman Rhee to abide by the POW agreement that they were obligated to execute, and said, "From this, we must conclude that Syngman Rhee is merely a shield for those American companies who fear that the general relaxation of tensions in Korea and internationally will bring about commercial and political bankruptcy." The paper concluded, "The developments in Korea in the past few weeks have been a great victory for the forces of peace. The recent situation further shows that everyone must redouble their efforts to crush all dying provocative actions and overcome the dollar and war."

The "German People's News," the organ of the "League of Germans for Unity, Peace and Freedom," published in Fulda, West Germany, on June 22nd, commented: "Syngman Rhee knows that once the armistice is achieved, his life on the political stage will be over. He is attempting to preserve his position at the expense of the interests of his people, so he is attempting to undermine the armistice by extremely tyrannical means."

Xinhua News Agency, Prague, June 26th: The Belgian "Red Flag" said on the 19th that Syngman Rhee's move to "release" prisoners of war with the connivance of the American army and American officers was a practical implementation of a provocative plan by anti-peace elements in the United States. The newspaper condemned the United States' condoning of Syngman Rhee's sabotage as a "huge conspiracy to undermine the signing of the armistice agreement." The paper pointed out that all prisoner-of-war camps are managed by American officers, "Who can believe that these experts in suppression in these camps (who have already massacred more than 3,000 people in places like Geoje Island) 'tried their best but could not prevent a large number of escapes'?"

The Danish "Land og Folk" said on the 19th that Syngman Rhee's actions were to hinder the armistice. The paper also said that at a time when the armistice agreement was about to be signed, the fascist satellite state of the United States committed this crime against peace, which was obviously impossible without the direct or indirect help of the American military.

Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, June 26th: Indian newspapers are dissatisfied with the United States' laissez-faire attitude towards Syngman Rhee's undermining of the armistice and demand that the United States promptly provide a satisfactory response to the questions raised by Marshal Kim Il Sung and General Peng Dehuai in their letters to Clark.

The "Times of India" editorial said: The United Nations authorities have indeed committed a serious and unforgivable crime. The questions raised by the Korean and Chinese sides are appropriate, and the only effective answer to these questions is to sanction those who refuse the armistice, do everything possible to collect the "released" prisoners of war, and demand comprehensive action to save the armistice.

The "Hindustan Times" said: If the United Nations wants to resume negotiations, it must give satisfactory answers to the questions raised by the Korean and Chinese sides. The paper's "Political Diary" column said: No one in New Delhi doubts that the United States is either an active supporter or a tacit approver of Syngman Rhee's behavior.

The "Tribune" editorial said: The guarantees demanded by the Korean and Chinese sides are completely reasonable, and the United Nations must give a satisfactory reply.

The "Amrita Bazar Patrika" editorial condemned Syngman Rhee for undermining the armistice and said: "Now, the main question is: what do the other United Nations member states intend to do? Are they going to succumb to the policies of the United States and merely be satisfied with protesting against Syngman Rhee?" The paper said, "Now, it is very clear that Eisenhower has no intention of taking strong action against Syngman Rhee... However, even if Syngman Rhee's actions receive moral support from the United States, no United Nations member state with any self-respect can tolerate such behavior that undermines the hope for peace."

Xinhua News Agency, June 26th: London News: The British "Yorkshire Post" expressed dissatisfaction with the United States for allowing Syngman Rhee to undermine the armistice.

The paper's June 25th editorial said: Syngman Rhee "must be regarded as an obstacle on the road to peace - if not a murderer of peace (he seems likely to be this kind of person)." The editorial believes: The United States does not seem to be as tough as we might expect in dealing with this "hot-tempered dictator" - Syngman Rhee. "Obviously, the United States' policy towards Syngman Rhee is one of 'prayer and persuasion'. But it is doubtful whether this policy can solve the problem." The editorial said: The United States may be able to use greater pressure on Syngman Rhee, but the question is whether the US government thinks this is wise. President Eisenhower may think it unwise to go against the opinions of those who sympathize with Syngman Rhee. The editorial said: "Syngman Rhee certainly understands this, so his actions inevitably have a large element of blackmail."

The "Daily Mirror" published an editorial on the 25th entitled "We've Had Enough," saying: "Now, the treacherous South Korean dictator Syngman Rhee is planning to continue the war into its fourth year." The editorial said: Syngman Rhee, in order to realize his ambitions, is prepared to make other countries "jump into the fire" with him.

    各国舆论继续谴责李承晚破坏协议
    【新华社柏林二十六日电】奥地利共产党机关报“奥地利人民之声报”发表评论说，李承晚最近的挑衅行动的真正目的，就是要破坏停战。
    该报说，“美国人假惺惺地说他们事先不知道这个把戏，但是没有一个人会相信这种说法。全世界都已知道，李承晚是被和平吓坏了，全世界也知道他的强迫扣留战俘的企图。”该报谴责美方没有采取任何措施迫使李承晚遵守他们有义务执行的战俘协议，并且说：“由此看来，我们不得不认为，李承晚只是那些害怕朝鲜和平与国际紧张局势的普遍缓和会带来商业上和政治上的破产的美国公司的挡箭牌。”该报最后说：“过去几周中朝鲜局势的发展是和平力量的伟大胜利。最近的局势又说明，大家必须加倍努力，粉碎所有垂死挣扎的挑衅行动，战胜美元和战争。”
    在西德孚尔达出版的“德国人争取统一、和平与自由联盟”的机关报“德国人民报”二十二日发表评论说：“李承晚知道，一旦停战实现，他在政治舞台上的生命就要完蛋。他企图牺牲他的人民的利益来保存他的地位，所以他企图用极其横暴的手段来破坏停战。”
    【新华社布拉格二十六日电】比利时“红旗报”十九日说，李承晚在美国军队和美国军官纵容下“释放”战俘的举动，是美国的反和平分子的挑衅计划的一次实际执行。该报斥责美国纵容李承晚的破坏活动是一种“破坏停战协定签订的巨大阴谋”。该报指出，所有的战俘营都由美国军官管理，“要是说这些战俘营中的镇压专家们（他们已经在巨济岛等地屠杀了三千多人）竟然‘竭尽其力也不能阻止大量的逃跑’，那有谁能够相信呢？”
    丹麦“国土与人民报”在十九日说，李承晚的行动就是为了阻碍停战。该报又说，在这停战协定正要签字的时候，美国的法西斯卫星国犯下了这桩对和平的罪行，这件事情如果没有美军方面的直接或间接的帮助，显然是不可能的。
    【新华社新德里二十六日电】印度报纸对美国放任李承晚破坏停战不满，要求美国迅速对金日成元帅和彭德怀将军在给克拉克的信件中提出的问题，作令人满意的答复。
    “印度时报”的社论说：联合国当局的确犯了严重不可宽恕的罪行。朝中方面提出的问题是适当的，对这些问题唯一有效的答复是制裁拒绝停战的人，尽一切力量搜集被“释放”的战俘，为了拯救停战，要求采取全面行动。
    “印度斯坦报”说：联合国如果要恢复谈判，必须对朝中方面所提问题作圆满答复。该报“政治日记”栏说：对李承晚的行为，美国如果不是积极支持者，那就是默许赞成者，这点在新德里是没有人怀疑的。
    “论坛报”的社论说：朝中方面所要求的保证是完全合理的，联合国必须作令人满意的答复。
    “甘露市场报”的社论斥责李承晚破坏停战后说：“现在，主要的问题是：别的联合国会员国打算怎么办？它们打算对美国的政策屈服，而仅仅满足于对李承晚提出抗议吗？”该报说：“现在，事情很清楚，艾森豪威尔一点也不打算对李承晚采取有力的行动……然而，即使李承晚的行动得到美国精神上的支持，凡是有一点自尊心的联合国会员国都是不能容忍这种破坏和平希望的行为的。”
    【新华社二十六日讯】伦敦消息：英国“约克郡邮报”对美国听任李承晚破坏停战表示不满。
    该报二十五日的社论说：李承晚“必须被认为是和平道路上的一个障碍——假如不是暗杀和平的人（看样子他可能就是这种人）。”社论认为：美国在应付这个“火气甚大的独裁者”——李承晚方面，似乎并未如我们可能预期的那么强硬。“显然，美国对待李承晚的政策是一种‘祈求与说服’的政策。但是这种政策是不是可以解决问题是值得怀疑的。”社论说：美国也许可能对李承晚使用比较大的压力，但是，问题在于美国政府是否认为这样做为明智。艾森豪威尔总统可能认为忤逆那些同情李承晚的人们的意见为不智之举。社论说：“李承晚当然很了解这一点，因此他的行动就不免有了很大的要胁成份。”
    “每日镜报”二十五日以“我们已受够了”为题发表社论说：“现在，背叛的南朝鲜独裁者李承晚正在打算使战争进行到第四年。”社论说：李承晚为了实现他的野心，准备使其他国家和他一齐“跳入火坑”。
