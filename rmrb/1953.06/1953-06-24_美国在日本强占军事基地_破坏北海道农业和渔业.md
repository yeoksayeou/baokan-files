Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 22nd: According to Japanese official announcements, in Hokkaido, which is densely covered with US military bases, the forcible occupation of large tracts of farmland by US occupation forces has caused 250 million yen in losses to local agricultural production. The loss of fisheries production caused by US military bases in Hokkaido has so far reached 13,080,000 yen.

The Japanese government also announced that the above-mentioned agricultural and fisheries losses have been "compensated" with 1.3 million yen. This is a sharp mockery of the large number of Hokkaido farmers and fishermen whose livelihoods have been destroyed by the US occupation forces.

    美国在日本强占军事基地
    破坏北海道农业和渔业
    【新华社二十二日讯】东京消息：据日本官方宣布，在密布美国军事基地的北海道，由于美国占领军强占大片耕地，已使当地的农业生产受到二亿五千万日元的损失。北海道美国军事基地造成的渔产损失，到目前为止也达一千三百零八十万日元。
    日本官方同时宣布：上述农业和渔业损失已得到一百三十万日元的“赔偿”。这对于被美国占领军破坏了生计的大批北海道农民和渔民是一种尖锐的嘲弄。
