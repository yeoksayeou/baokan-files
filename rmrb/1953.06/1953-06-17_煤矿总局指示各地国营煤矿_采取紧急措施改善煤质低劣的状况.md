The Coal Mine Management Bureau of the Ministry of Fuel Industry of the Central People's Government recently issued instructions on improving the quality of coal production, requiring the leaders of coal mine administrations in various regions to launch a mass movement among state-owned coal mines under their jurisdiction to improve coal quality, establish systems, strengthen institutions, and effectively change the current serious situation of poor coal quality in state-owned coal mines across the country.

The instructions pointed out: At present, there are serious problems with the quality of raw coal produced by coal mines. The actual ash content nationwide from January to April exceeded the plan by 1%. Except for a few bureaus and mines in the Southwest, Central South, Northeast (Fuxin, Hegang, Jiaohe, Jixi), and North China (Jingxing), the planned targets were not met. Among them, the more serious cases were Saimat exceeding the planned ash content by 4.5%, and Beipiao exceeding it by 3.7%. Others, such as Yangquan, Jiulonggang, Jiawang, and Hongshan, also exceeded the planned ash content. In particular, Guanshan Mine in Beipiao and Shiren Mine in Tonghua exceeded it by more than 10%. At the same time, sales coal contains a large amount of gangue. The gangue content in Hongshan reaches 3% to 11%, Datong No. 2 Mine reaches 2% to 5%, and Zazikou Mine in Huainan and Tonghua and Datai Mine in Jingxi contain a large amount of gangue. Even more prominent is Kailuan, which has coal washing equipment, still contains more than 3%. Individual coal cars even reach 20%. Due to the high ash content and gangue content of raw coal, the state has suffered huge losses, which has seriously affected other industries.

The instructions then pointed out: The main reason for the above situation is that leaders at all levels hold a simplistic view of emphasizing quantity over quality and fail to think about improving quality from the perspectives of operational technology and management. The mining methods are inappropriate, and there is a lack of gangue inspection. For example, Hongshan Sanshan Well mined a meter-thick stone layer, accounting for more than half of the total mining height, resulting in a gangue content of 30%. The mine manager even mistakenly said: Not mining gangue or not inspecting gangue will affect output and efficiency. They shelved the Product Inspection and Acceptance Rules issued by the Coal Mine Bureau in November 1952, and did not study or implement them. The coal mining team leader of Jiulonggang in Huainan broke stones and mixed them into the coal, posing as good coal. On March 11th, Datong Mine discovered a coal car with good coal on the surface but filled with gangue inside. On February 6th, the China Coal Company discovered gangue as large as 30 kilograms in the coal transported from Caijiagang. The organizational structure of various mines is also incomplete, lacking coal washing equipment. For example, Kailuan has no coal washing section, and Jiawang, Datong, etc. have the coal quality managed by the laboratory, and the Xi'an Bureau is managed by the transportation section. In addition, Yangquan, Datong, Jiawang, Jingxi, Caijiagang of Huainan, Xinzhuangzi and others do not have coal washing equipment. In order to reverse this serious situation and ensure the completion of the quality task, the instructions ordered all bureaus to deeply mobilize all employees in June to improve the phenomenon of poor quality, reverse the current one-sided view of emphasizing quantity over quality, and resolutely establish the idea of ​​attaching importance to quality. First of all, leading cadres are required to clarify the important significance of comprehensively completing production tasks and improving quality, and to conduct extensive publicity and education to all employees, expose typical cases of not paying attention to quality and deliberately adding gangue, conduct ideological criticism and processing. Those who attach importance to quality and have achieved results should be rewarded. On the basis of improving the ideological understanding of the masses, improve the coal quality management organization, establish a strict quality inspection and acceptance system, and formulate a responsibility system to strengthen quality, and conscientiously implement it.

The instructions also require all mines to improve coal mining operation methods, strengthen gangue inspection, and make full use of existing coal washing equipment and add necessary coal washing equipment.

    煤矿总局指示各地国营煤矿
    采取紧急措施改善煤质低劣的状况
    中央人民政府燃料工业部煤矿管理总局日前发出了关于提高产煤质量工作的指示，要求各地煤矿管理局领导所属国营煤矿，普遍展开一次群众性的改善煤质的运动，建立制度，加强机构，切实改变目前各地国营煤矿煤质低劣的严重状况。
    指示中指出：目前煤矿生产上的原煤质量存在着严重问题，全国一至四月份的实际灰分，比计划超过了百分之一。除西南、中南、东北的阜新、鹤岗、蛟河、鸡西，华北的井陉等少数局矿外，都未完成计划指标。其中较严重的如赛马超过计划灰分百分之四点五，北票超过百分之三点七，其余如阳泉、九龙岗、贾汪、洪山都超过计划灰分，特别是北票的冠山和通化的石人两矿，都超过百分之十以上。同时在销售煤中含有大量矸石，洪山含矸率达百分之三至十一，大同二矿达百分之二到五，淮南和通化的砟子矿、京西的大台矿都含有大量矸石，更突出的在有选煤设备的开滦尚含有百分之三以上。个别的煤车竟达百分之二十。由于原煤的灰分大，含矸率高，给国家造成了巨大的损失，使其他工业受到严重的影响。
    指示接着指出：造成以上情况的主要原因是各级领导上存在着单纯的重量不重质的观点，不从操作技术上和管理上想法提高质量，回采方法不适当，缺少检矸工作。如洪山三山井回采了一公尺厚的石头，占全采高的二分之一以上，使含矸量达百分之三十，矿长还错误地说：不采矸石或检定矸石，会影响产量和效率。他们将一九五二年十一月煤矿总局颁发的产品检查验收规则束之高阁，不研究，不执行。淮南九龙岗采煤队长打碎石头向煤里掺，充作好煤；大通矿三月十一日发现一个煤车表面装的好煤，里面全是矸子；中煤公司二月六日运蔡家岗的煤内发现三十公斤大的矸石。各矿的组织机构也不健全，缺乏选煤设备。如开滦没有选煤科，贾汪、大同等由化验室代管煤质，西安局由运输科附带管理。此外如阳泉、大同、贾汪、京西、淮南的蔡家岗、新庄子等都没有选煤设备。为了扭转这一严重局面，保证完成质量任务，指示中责令各局必须在六月间深入发动全体职工，改进质量低劣的现象，扭转目前重量不重质的片面观点，坚决树立重视质量的思想。首先要求领导干部明确全面完成生产任务和提高质量的重要意义，并对全体职工进行广泛的宣传教育，揭发不重视质量而故意掺矸石的典型，进行思想批判和处理。对重视质量而有成绩者应予以奖励。在提高群众思想认识的基础上，健全煤质管理机构，建立严格的质量检收制度，并订出加强质量的责任制，认真贯彻。
    指示中还要求各矿改进采煤操作方法，加强检矸工作，充分利用现有的选煤设备和增添必要的选煤设备。
