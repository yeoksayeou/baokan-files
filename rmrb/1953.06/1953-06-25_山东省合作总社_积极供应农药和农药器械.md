    Shandong Provincial Cooperative
    Actively Supplies Pesticides and Pesticide Equipment
    Due to the spring drought, Shandong Province has experienced insect pests such as locusts and cotton aphids. To support farmers in overcoming various insect pests and ensuring a bumper harvest of cotton and autumn crops, the Shandong Provincial Cooperative is currently actively supplying farmers with various insecticides and pesticide equipment. As of June 5th, the Provincial Cooperative had allocated 443,300 jin of pesticides and 33,313 sprayers to various regions. The Provincial Cooperative has also conducted tests on last year's stockpiled medicines to prevent supplying farmers with ineffective drugs.
    The prices of pesticides and pesticide equipment supplied by the Shandong Provincial Cooperative this year are generally lower than last year. In particular, local tobacco leaves, cotton oil soap, lime-sulfur mixture and other drugs are not only cheap but also prepared in large quantities, which can solve the problem of insufficient supply of chemical drugs. In terms of business operations, the contract system has been widely adopted. Counties sign contracts with the Provincial Cooperative based on the required quantities, and the Provincial Cooperative allocates them to the counties in a timely manner according to the contract stipulations. The Provincial Cooperative has also established storage and transportation stations along major transportation lines to appropriately reserve some pesticides and pesticide equipment for timely allocation.
    Regarding the use of pesticide equipment, the Shandong Provincial Cooperative particularly emphasizes strengthening technical guidance this year. The Cooperative requires local cooperatives to work closely with local agricultural departments to strengthen the training and regular guidance of technical cadres. It is essential to ensure that cadres are familiar with the properties of the drugs and the methods of use, and to impart technology to the masses to prevent poisoning, injuries, and damage to crops when using pesticides.

    山东省合作总社
    积极供应农药和农药器械
    山东省由于春旱，发生了蝗蝻、棉蚜等虫害。山东省合作总社为了支持农民战胜各种虫害，以保证棉花和大秋作物的丰收，目前正积极供应农民各种杀虫农药和农药器械。到六月五日止，省合作总社已调拨到各地农药四十四万三千三百斤，喷雾器三万三千三百一十三具。省合作总社并对去年积存的药品进行了化验，以免将失效的药品供给农民。
    山东省合作总社今年供应农药、农药器械的价格，普遍低于去年。特别是土烟叶、棉油皂、石灰硫磺合剂等药品，不仅价格便宜，而且数量准备得很多，可以解决化学药品供应不足的问题。在业务经营方面，普遍采用了合同制。各县根据需要数量与省社签订合同，省社按合同规定及时地调拨给各县。省合作总社并在各主要交通线上设立储运站，适当地储备一部分农药和农药器械，以备及时调拨之用。
    对于农药器械的使用，山东省合作总社今年特别强调要加强技术指导。该社要求各地合作社和当地农业部门密切结合，加强对技术干部的训练与经常的指导，必须做到使干部熟习药品的性能和使用的方法，并向群众传授技术，以防止在使用农药时发生中毒伤人和损害庄稼的现象。　（刘浩）
