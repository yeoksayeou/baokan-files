State-Owned Coal Mines in East China Universally Launch Work to Improve Coal Quality

The state-owned coal mines in East China have universally launched work to improve coal quality. In order to promote the progress of this work, the Ministry of Fuel Industry of the Central People's Government and the Coal Mine Administration Bureau, along with the East China Coal Mine Administration Bureau, have formed a coal quality inspection team to go to various mines to inspect the progress of the work.

The coal produced by most state-owned coal mines in East China is mostly in line with or close to standard specifications, and is therefore basically suitable for industrial and civilian use. However, after changes occurred in natural conditions and the proportion of mechanized coal mining increased, the mines did not adopt effective measures in operation methods and organization management to adapt to these changes to ensure coal quality. As a result, the average quality of most coal mines in East China gradually declined. For example, the average ash content in the first quarter of this year for the Jiulonggang Mine and Caijiagang Mine under the Huainan Bureau, and the Hanqiao Mine and Taozhuang Coal Mine under the Jiawang Bureau, all increased compared to last year. The situation is even more significant in the mines of Zibo. Furthermore, the gangue content of the 305 working face of the Hanqiao Mine in Jiawang reached as high as 30 percent, with the largest piece of gangue weighing 27 kilograms. Highly explosive materials such as detonators and explosives were also found in the coal of the Jiawang Mining Bureau. The poor coal quality has seriously affected the burning process for users, resulting in much waste and loss.

The one-sided task viewpoint and disregard for quality by leading cadres at all levels in state-owned coal mines in East China is the main reason for the poor coal quality. For example, the leading cadres of the Jiawang Bureau insisted on "waiting" until all other indicators were completed before focusing on quality. The director of the Caijia Mine had never specifically convened a meeting to discuss coal quality since taking office. Some mines even wanted to see where the coal was used before deciding whether to improve its quality. For example, the leading cadres of the Taozhuang Mine said: "If our coal can be completely used in the coking and metallurgical industries, we can actively find ways to improve its quality." They felt that there was no need to improve coal quality at present. More seriously, some mines, disregarding the interests of the country and the people, instructed workers to mix low-priced, poor-quality dirty coal into good coal, artificially reducing the coal quality, in an attempt to sell it for more money, driven by narrow departmentalism.

Currently, state-owned coal mines in East China have begun to launch work to improve coal quality, and some mines have achieved certain results. At present, the work of improving coal quality in various bureaus and mines can be roughly divided into three types: The first type is those that have already achieved certain results. For example, the Zibo Mining Bureau has successively held two large-scale meetings on improving coal quality, specifically stipulating the gangue content and gangue specifications for each mine and each type of coal; ordering each mine to resolutely improve technical operating methods and implement layered coal mining; establishing a relatively universal and strict system for inspecting and accepting raw coal at the pithead; modifying the quota coefficients caused by changes in operating methods; mobilizing the masses to restore and improve the three-stage sorting system underground; improving coal yard technical management, and strengthening manual sorting work. As a result, the gangue content of raw coal coming out of the pit has significantly decreased. The gangue content of the No. 3 coal seam in the Kuishan Mine decreased from 13.3 percent to 3.2 percent, and the No. 5 coal seam in the Hongshan Mine decreased from 11 percent to 3 percent. The gangue content of the No. 5 coal seam, which was the worst in quality in the past, dropped to 0.62 percent when shipped out, and the No. 7 coal seam dropped to 1.75 percent. The second type is those that have made some specific arrangements, but have not yet achieved significant results, such as the Huainan, Taozhuang, and Fangzi mines. Before the inspection team arrived, these mines were conveying and discussing the instructions of the Ministry of Fuel Industry on improving coal quality; holding meetings to study and formulate relatively complete inspection and reward and punishment systems; some also started with publicity and education, extensively mobilizing the masses. After the inspection team arrived, they further examined the erroneous understanding of neglecting quality, expressing their determination and confidence to improve quality in the future; or quickly made corrections after the inspection team pointed out the shortcomings. For example, the Datong Mine did not process water coal in a timely manner, and the organization and management of the mechanical selection station was lax. After being pointed out by the inspection team, it quickly adjusted the organization of the gangue sorting workers, and the gangue content of selected lump coal decreased from 5 percent to 2 percent. The third type is those that have not yet made serious arrangements or taken action. For example, the leading cadres of the Jiawang Mining Bureau have serious one-sided task viewpoints and have never made up their minds to improve quality. Although a meeting on improving quality was forced to be held in mid-April, and a resolution was made, due to the lack of inspection and supervision, some mines did not implement it thoroughly, and some mines did not implement it at all.

    华东区国营各煤矿普遍展开改善煤质工作
    华东区各国营煤矿已普遍开展了提高煤质的工作。为了推动这一工作的进行，中央人民政府燃料工业部和煤矿管理总局、华东煤矿管理局组成了煤质检查组，前往各矿检查工作的进行情况。
    华东区多数国营煤矿的产煤质量大部分是切合或接近标准规格的，因而基本上适宜于工业用和民用。但是在自然条件发生变化和机械化采煤比重增大以后，各矿在操作方法、组织管理各方面都没有采取与此相适应的有效措施，来保证煤的质量，因此，华东区多数煤矿平均质量逐渐下降。如淮南局九龙岗矿、蔡家岗矿、贾汪局韩桥矿、陶庄煤矿今年第一季度的平均灰份均较去年增加，淄博各矿表现得更为显著。又如贾汪韩桥矿三○五工作面含矸率竟达百分之三十，矸石最大者达二十七公斤，贾汪矿务局的煤里还发现烈性爆炸物如雷管炸药等。煤质低劣严重地影响了用户的燃用，造成了许多浪费和损失。
    华东国营煤矿各级领导干部的片面任务观点和忽视质量的思想，是造成煤质低劣的主要原因。如贾汪局的领导干部硬要“等待”其他指标全部完成了再来专搞质量，蔡家矿矿长自到职以来从未专门召开过会议讨论煤质。还有的矿要看煤用在什么地方再决定是否提高煤质。如陶庄矿的领导干部说：“我们的煤如能完全用在炼焦、冶金工业上，可以积极设法提高煤质。”他们觉得现在不需要提高煤质。更严重的是有的矿竟不顾国家和人民的利益，从狭隘的本位思想出发，指使工人把价低质劣的脏煤掺入好煤中，人为地降低煤质，企图多卖钱。
    现在，华东各国营煤矿已开始展开改进煤质的工作，有的矿已取得了一定成绩。目前各局、矿改进煤质的工作，大致可分为三种类型：第一种类型是已经取得了一定成绩的。如淄博矿务局，已先后召开过两次规模较大的提高煤质会议，具体规定了各矿各煤种的含矸率和矸石规格；责成各矿坚决改进技术操作方法，实行分层采煤；比较普遍地建立了严格的井口毛煤检查验收等制度；修改了因操作方法的改变而引起的定额系数；发动群众恢复和健全了坑下三拣制度；改进了煤场技术管理，加强了手选工作。结果出井毛煤含矸率显著下降。奎山矿三行煤含矸率由百分之十三点三降为百分之三点二，洪山矿五行煤由百分之十一降为百分之三。过去质量最劣的五行煤外运含矸率降至百分之零点六二，七行煤降至百分之一点七五。第二种类型是虽已作了一些具体布置，但尚未取得显著成绩的，如淮南、陶庄、坊子各矿。这些矿在检查组未到达以前，正在传达讨论中央燃料工业部关于提高煤质的指示；召开了会议，研究制订了比较完整的检验和奖惩制度；有的并从宣传教育入手，广泛发动了群众。在检查组到达以后，他们进一步检查了轻视质量的错误认识，表示了今后提高质量的决心和信心；或者在检查组指出缺点后迅速作了纠正。如大通矿水煤处理不及时，机选台的组织管理松懈，经检查组指出后，即迅速调整了拣矸工的组织，选后块煤含矸率因而由百分之五降为百分之二。第三种类型是还没有认真布置，也没有行动起来的。如贾汪矿务局领导干部存在着严重的片面任务观点，始终没有下决心来提高质量。四月中旬虽曾被迫召开过一次提高质量会议，作出了决议，因没有检查督促，有的矿执行不彻底，有的矿根本没有执行。（王绍雄）
