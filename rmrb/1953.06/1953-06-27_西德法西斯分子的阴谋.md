    West German Fascists' Conspiracy
    Soviet Union, Naumov
    West Germany and West Berlin, under the wings of the most aggressive foreign elements, are increasingly becoming breeding grounds for fascism and reactionary forces.
    There are now more than fifty fascist organizations in West Germany, not counting the many "military" leagues that have rounded up revanchist Hitler soldiers. These organizations are all controlled by the fascist "Steel Helmet" organization, chaired by former Hitler Marshal Kesselring.
    In the past few months, a number of new fascist parties and organizations have emerged in West Germany. The Hamburg City Council recently allowed a new fascist political party, the "German Unity Party," to be established. In mid-May, a fascist organization, the "German Youth Friendship League," was founded. The so-called "League of Victims of Denazification," composed entirely of former Nazi Party activists, has greatly intensified its activities.
    The Socialist Reich Party and the German Youth League have been revived under new names.
    The number of openly militarist organizations is constantly increasing. Among the recently established organizations is the "German Naval League," which recruits former German naval officers and soldiers. The "German Non-Commissioned Officers League" was established in Aschaffenburg.
    According to a Deutsche Presse-Agentur Bonn dispatch, thirty fascist organizations are holding secret talks to discuss "joint measures." In early May, these organizations held a special meeting in Oldenburg to specifically formulate their common program.
    The so-called "German Party" – the third largest party in Adenauer's coalition government – recently adopted an election platform at its congress in Hamburg, which openly demanded the deprivation of the working class's right to political strike; the strangulation of trade unions through "taxation"; the freedom for war industry monopoly capital to do whatever it wants in all aspects of political and economic life; the rehabilitation of all war criminals and active fascists; compensation for these people for "the damage suffered in the process of denazification"; the punishment of all those who helped expose war criminals at the time; and the immediate re-establishment of a Hitler-style Wehrmacht.
    The following facts show who is funding the fascist organizations. The recent communiqué of the All-German People's Party, headed by Heinemann, a former minister in Bonn, published some materials about the income of the German Youth League (which has nominally declared its dissolution). The sources of income for this league include donations from the Bonn government, donations from Coca-Cola and the Bosch monopoly capital; and "American figures" have also generously funded it.
    Facts show that specially trained murderers were widely used in the riots organized by foreign mercenaries in Berlin on June 17.
    According to democratic newspapers, there are more than thirty various terrorist organizations and groups in West Berlin, recruiting criminals and former fascist murderers. The leaders of these organizations are former SS officers and professional murderers.
    The terrorist organizations in West Berlin include: the militaristic Steel Helmet, the Willewolf team, the Association for the Salvation of Nordic Culture, the German National Youth League, "Adolf Hitler Tradition," the Brotherhood, the Pirate Group, and many other organizations. They attack peace-loving people, destroy the offices of democratic organizations, and disrupt various gatherings of working people.
    On June 17, the provocateurs of the Berlin adventure mustered fascist bandits who live off the money of American and German imperialists and launched riots in the democratic areas of the German capital, attempting to obstruct the peaceful resolution of the German question, the strengthening of the democratic forces of the German people, and the unification of Germany into a democratic and peace-loving country. But their adventure failed. Its organizers were caught on the spot. The German working people unanimously condemned these fascist provocateurs.
    An old glazier in Berlin said: Everything seen on the streets of Berlin on June 17 was exactly the same as the fascist bandits who stormed into Berlin twenty years ago. Can we allow such dirty things to pollute our lives again?
    These simple words of this old Berlin worker explain why the fascist provocation instigated by fascist mercenaries in the Berlin area suffered a miserable defeat.

    西德法西斯分子的阴谋
    苏联　瑙莫夫
    西德和西柏林在最具侵略性的外国人士的卵翼下，正越来越成为法西斯主义和反动势力的滋长地。
    西德现在有五十多个法西斯组织，许多网罗了复仇主义者希特勒军人的“军人”联盟还不计算在内。这些组织都受由前希特勒元帅凯塞林任主席的法西斯“钢盔”组织支配。
    在过去几个月里，西德出现了一批新的法西斯党派和组织。汉堡市议会最近准许一个新的法西斯政党“德国团结党”建立。五月中，一个法西斯组织“德国青年友好联盟”成立了。完全由前纳粹党活动分子组成的所谓“受肃清纳粹主义之害者联盟”已大大地加紧了它们的活动。
    社会帝国党和德国青年联盟又在新的名义下恢复了。
    公开军国主义的组织数目不断在增加。在最近成立的组织里面，有一个是网罗前德国海军官兵的“德国海军联盟”。在阿沙芬堡成立了“德国下级军官联盟”。
    据德意志通讯社波恩消息，三十个法西斯组织正在举行秘密谈判，讨论“联合措施”。五月初，这些组织在奥登堡举行了一次特别会议，专门拟订它们的共同纲领。
    所谓“德意志党”——阿登纳联合政府中的第三大党——最近在汉堡举行的代表大会通过了一个选举纲领，其中公然要求剥夺工人阶级的政治罢工权利；以“征税”的办法来扼杀工会；使战争工业垄断资本在政治、经济生活的各方面能畅所欲为；给所有战犯、活动的法西斯分子恢复名誉；赔偿这些人“在肃清纳粹主义过程中受到的损害”；惩处所有当时曾帮助揭发战犯的人；立即重新建立希特勒式的国防军。
    以下的事实表明谁在资助法西斯组织。以波恩一位前任部长海涅曼为首的全德人民党最近的公报发表了一些材料，说到德国青年联盟（名义上已宣布解散）的经费收入情况。这一联盟的收入来源中，有波恩政府的捐款，有可口可乐公司和波什垄断资本的捐款；还有“美国人士”也曾慷慨资助过。
    事实表明，六月十七日外国雇佣分子在柏林所组织的骚乱中曾广泛地利用了受过特别训练的杀人凶手。
    据民主报纸消息，西柏林有三十个以上的各种恐怖组织与团体，网罗着犯罪分子和前法西斯凶手。这些组织的领袖是前党卫军军官和职业凶手。
    西柏林的恐怖分子组织中有：军国主义的钢盔队、维勒沃尔夫队、拯救北欧文化协会、德国全国青年联盟、“阿道夫·希特勒传统”、兄弟会、海盗团及许多其他的组织。它们攻击爱好和平的人民、捣毁民主组织的办公处、破坏劳动人民种种集会。
    六月十七日，柏林冒险事件的挑衅分子啸聚了靠美国和德国帝国主义者的金钱生活的法西斯匪徒，在德国首都的民主区发动暴乱，想这样来阻挠和平解决德国问题、阻挠德国人民民主力量的增强并阻挠德国统一成为一个民主和爱好和平的国家。但是它们的这次冒险失败了。它的组织者被当场捉住。德国劳动人民一致谴责这些法西斯挑衅分子。
    柏林一个老釉工说：六月十七日在柏林街上看到的一切完全和二十年前冲进柏林的法西斯匪徒一样。难道可以容许这种肮脏东西再来玷污我们的生活吗？
    这位老柏林工人所说的几句简单的话说明了：为什么法西斯雇佣分子在柏林区所策动的法西斯挑衅遭到惨败。
