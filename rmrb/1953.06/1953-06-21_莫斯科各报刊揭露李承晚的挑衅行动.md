Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, June 20th: Moscow newspapers are paying attention to Syngman Rhee's provocative actions. Today, all newspapers published the report from the Xinhua News Agency's special correspondent in Kaesong regarding Syngman Rhee's actions, with the tacit consent of the US, violating the POW repatriation agreement. The newspapers also published the attitudes of British newspapers, the UN Secretary-General, and the US regarding Syngman Rhee's actions.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, June 20th: "Literary Gazette" published three photos and a short commentary on June 20th under the title "Provocative Actions in South Korea."

The first photo (originally published in the American magazine "Life") - UN troops aiming machine guns at POW camps enclosed by barbed wire. The second photo (originally published in the British bourgeois magazine "Globe") - Captured Chinese and Korean personnel being transported in barbed wire trucks. The third photo (originally published in "Globe" magazine) - Captured Chinese and Korean personnel forced to sit down by tanks and bayonets.

"Literary Gazette" wrote: Endless humiliation, trampling, unrestricted tyranny, and contempt for human rights - these are precisely the system that captured Chinese and Korean personnel detained in concentration camps controlled by the US and Syngman Rhee's troops have suffered for years. The photos published are one of the supplementary evidences. Less than two weeks ago, an agreement on the repatriation of prisoners of war was signed in Panmunjom. This agreement opened up prospects for prisoners of war suffering in American concentration camps to get rid of the violent system and to restore their human rights. Now, due to the provocative actions of the Syngman Rhee gang, tens of thousands of Korean prisoners of war have become victims of new violence – South Korean puppet troops playing the role of "releasing" them from the POW camps. The true meaning of this "release action" is characterized by the fact that it is accompanied by new bloodshed and new massacres of POWs. According to London broadcasts, in a POW camp near Seoul alone, thirty-three Korean prisoners of war were massacred and one hundred were injured during the "release." Foreign newspapers prove that Syngman Rhee's agents helped prisoners of war "escape," while using tear gas to drive them on. Xinhua News Agency pointed out that "Syngman Rhee's bandits say they are 'releasing' them, but in reality, they are using force and secret agents in collusion from inside and outside to coerce them to leave the POW camps and forcibly incorporate them into Syngman Rhee's puppet army." This is confirmed by a report from Busan by an Associated Press reporter, who stated that "South Korean senior officials" declared that most of the "released" prisoners of war would be incorporated into the Rhee puppet army. Xinhua News Agency stated in its report that "the US military headquarters cannot shirk its grave responsibility for this incident." Syngman Rhee's provocative actions, carried out when the Korean armistice negotiations are nearing completion, have aroused widespread concern in world public opinion. "Literary Gazette" then cited comments from Churchill and British newspapers, as well as from France and Canada. Literary Gazette said: These and many other comments in foreign newspapers convincingly prove that the provocations of opponents of peace are still attempts to obstruct the Korean armistice negotiations, and this provocation has aroused legitimate condemnation from widespread world public opinion.

    莫斯科各报刊揭露李承晚的挑衅行动
    【新华社莫斯科二十日电】莫斯科各报都注意李承晚的挑衅行动。二十日，各报都登载了新华社开城特派记者关于李承晚在美方默许下违反遣俘协议的行动的报道。各报也登载了英国报纸、联合国秘书长和美方对李承晚行动的态度。
    【新华社莫斯科二十日电】“文学报”二十日以“在南朝鲜的挑衅行动”为题，发表了三幅照片和一篇短评。
    第一幅照片（原载美国“生活”杂志）——联合国军队用机关枪向铁丝网内的战俘营瞄准。第二幅照片（原载英国资产阶级“寰球”杂志）——中朝被俘人员被放在铁丝网的卡车内押送。第三幅照片
    （原载“寰球”杂志）——以坦克和刺刀逼迫坐下不动的朝中被俘人员。
    “文学报”写道：无穷尽的侮辱、蹂躏，无限制的横暴，蔑视人权——这些正是现在全世界都知道的、在美国和李承晚军队控制下的集中营里被扣的朝中被俘人员长年累月所遭受的制度。所登照片是补充证据之一。不到二星期前，在板门店签订了战俘遣返问题的协议。这协议为在美国集中营受磨难的战俘打开摆脱暴力制度的前途，打开恢复他们的人权的前途。现在由于李承晚匪帮的挑衅行动，几万朝鲜战俘成为新暴力——南朝鲜傀儡军队扮演“释放”他们出战俘营——的牺牲品。这种“释放行动”的真义以这样的事实为特点，就是伴随着的是新的流血，对战俘的新屠杀。据伦敦广播，仅汉城附近一战俘营中，在“释放”过程中，就屠杀了三十三个和打伤了一百个朝鲜战俘。外国报刊证明，李承晚特务帮助战俘“逃跑”，同时用催泪瓦斯弹赶上他们。新华社指出，“李承晚匪徒说是‘释放’他们，实际上就是里应外合地使用武力和特务胁迫他们离开战俘营，把他们强编到李承晚伪军队中去。”这由美联社记者从釜山的报道证实了，这个报道说“南朝鲜高级官员”声明，大多数被“释放”的战俘将被编入李伪军。新华社在自己的报道中确定“美军总部是绝不能推卸对这一事件的严重责任的”。李承晚的挑衅行动，是在朝鲜停战谈判将近完成的时候进行的，引起了广泛的世界舆论界的耽心。“文学报”接着举出邱吉尔和英国报刊以及法国、加拿大的评论。文学报说：外国报刊的这些以及许多其他的评论，确信地证明，和平反对者的挑衅行为依然是企图妨碍朝鲜的停战谈判，这个挑衅行动引起了广泛的世界舆论界的合理的斥责。
