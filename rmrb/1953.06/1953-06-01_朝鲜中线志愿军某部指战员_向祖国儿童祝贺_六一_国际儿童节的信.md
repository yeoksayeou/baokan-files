Dear Children of the Motherland:

    As your holiday is approaching, we won a victory on the Kim Sung front. We think: when you hear this news of victory, you will surely jump up with joy, sing even more happily, and beat the waist drum even louder!

    Children! We are thinking of you every day on the Korean battlefield, and we seem to see the joyful scene of you welcoming "June 1st" Children's Day, as if we heard you asking: "Volunteer Army uncles, did you receive the gifts we entrusted to the art troupe visiting Korea?" Children, we received them! Before our victory this time, the art troupe visiting Korea sent by the people of the motherland arrived at the Korean front. They took out your precious gifts - badges commemorating Chairman Mao and badges for safeguarding peace - and, according to your instructions, personally pinned them on our chests. Looking at these badges, we seemed to see you - a group of innocent, lively, and healthy children. On that day, everyone expressed together: In order to defend our motherland and to defend our dear children to live a happy life, we must win the battle.

    Children! Not long after the visiting art troupe brought us the commemorative badges, we won a victory on the mountain south of Kohori. Starting from the evening of May 13th, we fought for four days and five nights, eliminating a total of more than 1,300 enemies and obtaining many machine guns and other spoils of war. In this battle, our artillery was numerous and fierce, and as soon as we fired, we drove all the enemies into the tunnels; as soon as our anti-aircraft guns went up the mountain, they shot down and wounded fourteen American planes in a row, scaring the American planes so much that they dared not fly low again. After winning this battle, we and our brother units together fought a second victory near Chestnut Cave South Mountain southeast of Kim Sung and Kowloon Village southwest of Kim Sung. This battle started on the evening of May 27th. That night, we captured several enemy hilltops, annihilating an entire company and eight entire platoons of the enemy's puppet Fifth and Eighth Divisions. The next day, we defeated twelve enemy counterattacks and killed and wounded many enemies.

    In these two battles, many brave comrades emerged in our unit. Let's just talk about a few of the youngest little warriors! In the battle on the mountain south of Kohori, there was a young Hunan warrior named Li Quansheng who was less than twenty years old. He was brave and resourceful in battle. He didn't care about the injury on his arm. When his superiors asked him to leave the line of fire, he said, "I won't go down, light injuries don't leave the line of fire!" He persisted on the mountain for three days and three nights, killing more than 30 enemies. Why was he so brave? Before the battle, he said, "I want to fight well, make merit and write letters to the children of the motherland to thank them for their love for us!" In the battle on Chestnut Cave South Mountain, there were also two young warriors named Zhou Laotie and Shen Wuxing. They bravely destroyed three enemy bunkers and a tunnel entrance, destroyed an enemy heavy machine gun, and enabled the assault team to quickly break into the enemy's tunnel and eliminate the enemy. The leaders congratulated them, saying they fought well and would give them credit.

    Children! We offer the victory on the Kim Sung front as a gift for your holiday. We love peace, but when we heard that the American invading bandits, after resuming armistice negotiations at Panmunjom, used planes to bomb Andong in our country and the Chosin Reservoir in Korea, killing hundreds and thousands of Chinese and Korean people, we were filled with hatred. We are determined to fight heroically to the end for a peaceful solution to the Korean issue and defend your right to study hard and live a happy life. We hope that the children will study hard, exercise, be model Young Pioneers, be good children of Chairman Mao, and prepare to serve our country's great peaceful construction in the future!

    朝鲜中线志愿军某部指战员
    向祖国儿童祝贺“六一”国际儿童节的信祖国亲爱的小朋友们：
    当你们的节日快要来到的时候，我们在金城前线打了胜仗。我们想：你们听了这个胜利消息，一定会高兴得跳起来，歌儿一定唱得更欢，腰鼓一定打得更响！
    小朋友们！我们在朝鲜战场上天天想着你们，也好像看到了你们那种愉快地迎接“六一”儿童节的情景，好像听到了你们在问：“志愿军叔叔们，我们托赴朝慰问文艺工作团带给你们的礼物，你们收到了吗？”小朋友们，我们收到了！在我们这次打胜仗以前，祖国人民派来的赴朝慰问文艺工作团就到了朝鲜前线，他们拿出你们珍贵的礼物——毛主席纪念章和保卫和平纪念章，按照小朋友们的嘱咐，亲自挂到了我们的胸前。我们看着这些纪念章，就好像看见了你们——一群天真活泼、身体健康的孩子们一样。当天，大家一齐表示：为了保卫我们的祖国，为了保卫我们亲爱的孩子们过幸福的生活，我们一定要打胜仗。
    小朋友们！慰问文工团给我们带上了纪念章不久，我们就在科湖里以南山上打了个胜仗。从五月十三号晚上起，我们打了四天五夜，一共消灭了一千三百多个敌人，还得到了好多机关枪和别的胜利品。这次战斗，我们的大炮又多又猛，一开炮就全把敌人赶进了坑道；我们的高射炮一上山，一连打落打伤了十四架美国飞机，吓得美国飞机再也不敢低飞了。打了这个胜仗以后，我们又和兄弟部队一起，在金城东南栗洞南山和金城西南九龙里附近，打了第二个胜仗，这个战斗是五月二十七日晚上开始的。这一夜，我们打下了敌人好几个山头，全歼守敌李伪军第五师、第八师一个整连和八个整排。第二天，我们又打垮了敌人十二次反扑，杀伤了许多敌人。
    在这两次战斗中，我们部队里出现了许多勇敢的同志，我们只说几个最年轻的小勇士吧！在科湖里以南山上的战斗中，有一个不到二十岁的湖南小勇士李全生，打起仗来又勇敢、又机智，他胳膊上负了伤也不管，上级叫他下火线，他说：“不下去，轻伤不下火线啊！”他一直在山上坚持了三天三夜，打死了三十多个敌人。他为什么这样勇敢呢？在打仗以前他就说过：“我要好好打仗，立了功给祖国小朋友们写信，感谢他们对我们的热爱！”在栗洞南山的战斗里，也有两个年轻的勇士，他们的名字叫周老铁和沈武兴，他们两个勇敢地炸毁了敌人三个地堡和一个坑道口，炸毁了敌人一挺重机枪，使突击组很快就突进了敌人的坑道，消灭了敌人。首长向他们祝贺，说他们打得好，还要给他们记功。
    小朋友们！我们把在金城前线的胜利作为给你们过节的礼物。我们是热爱和平的，但当我们听到美国侵略强盗在板门店恢复停战谈判以后，又用飞机轰炸我国的安东，轰炸朝鲜的贮水池，杀害成百成千中国和朝鲜人民的时候，我们心中激起了万分仇恨。我们坚决要为和平解决朝鲜问题英勇奋斗到底，保卫你们好好读书和过幸福的生活。我们希望小朋友们努力学习，锻炼身体，作一个模范的少年儿童队员，作毛主席的好孩子，准备将来为我们祖国伟大的和平建设服务！
