    Grape Valley in May
    Xinhua News Agency reporters Han Wenhui, Wang An, and Xiage'er
    From Turpan city, take a horse-drawn carriage fifteen li northeast to reach the famous raisin production area - Grape Valley.
    Grape Valley is fifteen li long. On both sides of the valley is the legendary "Flaming Mountain." In the sweltering summer, when strong winds blow up the red soil on the mountains, it looks from a distance as if flames are spewing from the mountain peaks. Many springs originate at the upper end of the valley, converging into a stream that flows down the valley. Diligent Uyghur farmers have reclaimed wasteland and built canals, transforming this mountain valley into a vineyard with more than 5,600 mu of land.
    When the carriage travels outside the valley, the early summer in the Turpan Basin is scorching, and the stuffy heat makes people feel suffocated. Sweat drips from the horses' backs. Once inside the lush, shady Grape Valley, it feels particularly cool. Clear streams flow among the dense grape vines, and the vines are laden with grapes, already emitting a rich fragrance. Looking from the hillside to the bottom of the valley, a green expanse of grape vines reveals beehive-like flat-roofed houses, which are the "Haman" (houses specially built for drying grapes) used by Uyghur farmers to dry raisins. When the grapes are ripe, the farmers dry the fresh grapes here into the famous raisins.
    The grape blossoms determine the abundance of the grape harvest. Uyghur farmers have tried every means to protect the grape blossoms in order to strive for a bumper harvest. They have planted dense trees around the vineyards to protect the grape blossoms from the strong winds of early summer in Turpan. When the grapes are about to bloom, the chickens and dogs of every household are strictly controlled, and the girls spend all day under the grape blossoms, chasing away birds to prevent them from knocking off the flowers. Every year when the flowers are in full bloom, the farmers are happy and nervous, watching the changes in the weather day and night. This year, the windy season has passed safely, and the crystal-like grapes hanging from the vines herald this year's bumper harvest. Now, Uyghur girls in the vineyard are weaving baskets with peach and mulberry branches under the vine shade, preparing to pick grapes. The vineyard is filled with laughter and joyful songs and dances.
    In recent years, grapes have been selling well in major cities across the country, giving farmers the confidence to expand production. From last year to now, more than 700 new grapevines have been added to Grape Valley, and this year, each vine has been fertilized with an average of more than 200 jin of sheep manure. Many farmers have bought oil residue as fertilizer, which is a first for Grape Valley. Some "Haman" have cracks in their roofs due to years of disrepair. The farmers are afraid that the sun will shine in and turn the grapes black. Some "Haman" are built in damp places, and the farmers are afraid that the dried raisins will lose their original flavor. Now, farmers are rushing to repair these old "Haman" and build new ones.

    五月的葡萄沟
    新华社记者  韩文慧  王安  夏格尔
    从吐鲁番城坐马车向东北走十五里，就到了全国著名的葡萄干产区——葡萄沟。
    葡萄沟长十五里，沟的两边，就是传说中的“火焰山”，在酷热的夏季，狂风刮起山上的红土，远看就像山头喷出一道道的火焰。沟的上端有许多泉水，顺沟汇成一条溪流，勤劳的维吾尔族农民开荒修渠，把这条山沟变成了一座拥有五千六百多亩土地的葡萄园。
    马车在沟外行走时，吐鲁番盆地酷热的初夏，闷热得使人感到窒息。马脊背上的汗水一滴一滴往下流。一进翠绿荫浓的葡萄沟，便感觉到特别凉爽。在茂密的葡萄藤丛中，穿流着一条条清澈的溪水，满枝累累的葡萄，已经放出馥郁的芳香。从山坡向沟底看去，一片葱绿的葡萄藤上面，露出一顶一顶蜂窝似的平房，这是维吾尔族农民晾葡萄干用的
    “哈满”（为晾干葡萄特建的房屋）。当葡萄成熟后，农民们就把新鲜的葡萄在这儿晾成著名的葡萄干。
    葡萄花能决定葡萄收成的丰歉。维吾尔族农民为了争取丰收，想尽了一切办法来保护葡萄花。他们在葡萄园的四周种植了密密的树木，保护葡萄花免受吐鲁番初夏狂风的吹袭。当葡萄将要开花时，家家户户的鸡犬都被严格管制起来，姑娘们整天在葡萄花树下驱逐着鸟雀，防止鸟雀撞落花朵。每年在鲜花怒放时，农民们的心情愉快而又紧张，日夜注视着天色的变化。今年已经平安地度过了风季，挂满枝藤的水晶般的葡萄，预告着今年的丰收。现在，葡萄园里的维吾尔族姑娘们正在藤荫下用桃条和桑条编织篮子，准备摘葡萄。葡萄园里，不时洋溢着嘻笑和欢乐的歌舞声。
    近年来，葡萄畅销到全国各大城市，给农民带来了扩大生产的信心。从去年到现在，葡萄沟里增加了七百多墩新葡萄，今年每墩葡萄平均上了二百多斤羊粪。有许多农民买了油渣做肥料，这在葡萄沟还是第一次。有些“哈满”因年久失修顶上裂开了缝道，农民们怕太阳晒进去，把葡萄颜色变黑，有些“哈满”因建筑在阴湿地方，农民们又怕晾出来的葡萄干失去了原来的味道。现在，农民们正纷纷补修这些旧“哈满”，建筑新的“哈满”。
