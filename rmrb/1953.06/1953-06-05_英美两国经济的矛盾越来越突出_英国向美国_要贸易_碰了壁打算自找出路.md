Xinhua News Agency, 4th Dispatch: To resolve the severe trade and economic crisis caused by the policies of pursuing military expansion and restricting trade between the East and West, Britain held a Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Economic Conference in London at the end of November last year with other Commonwealth member states. At this meeting, the Commonwealth's "development plan" was discussed, and it was decided to request assistance from the United States, including: the United States reducing tariffs, the United States purchasing raw materials from the sterling area at stable prices over the long term, the United States investing in the sterling area, and the United States increasing the price of gold.

In early March of this year, British Foreign Secretary Eden and Chancellor of the Exchequer Butler personally went to Washington to discuss these demands with the Eisenhower government. However, they went with high hopes but returned disappointed. The United States has always used manipulating the price of raw materials in the capitalist world market as a means of exerting pressure on other countries, especially Britain. Therefore, in the face of constantly falling raw material prices, it was naturally "uninterested" in Britain's request to purchase British raw materials at stable prices over the long term. On the issue of investment, Britain hoped that the United States would only contribute money to help the Commonwealth develop resources, but the United States took the opportunity to demand the free exchange of the pound sterling to facilitate the entry of American monopoly capital into the British Empire; Britain "in principle" agreed to gradually implement free exchange, but demanded that the United States first lend Britain huge sums of dollars as an exchange fund. Naturally, the American capitalists, who never give anything away for free, did not agree to this kind of slippery business deal. So the talks were all empty words. Britain's demand to raise the price of gold touched on the American policy of using low gold prices to keep Britain in a state of long-term reserve shortage, and the United States simply refused outright. As for the issue of opening up the American market, which Britain had placed the greatest hope on, not only was there no hope of a solution, but the calls for strengthening trade protection measures in the United States were becoming increasingly loud.

The illusions and hopes placed on the United States at the Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Economic Conference in November last year were shattered, and Britain's financial crisis increased rather than decreased. This forced Britain to rethink its strategy. The pro-American British magazine "The Economist" recently said: "Some kind of 'second-best' plan seems to be in the works." This plan is "some kind of freer payment and trade system within Europe."

Since Eden and Butler returned disappointed from Washington, Britain has carried out a series of activities. First, on March 24, Britain announced the relaxation of import quotas for Western Europe, increasing them from 44 percent to 58 percent, while also increasing the foreign exchange limit for travel expenses to Western Europe, with the aim of persuading the mainland of Western Europe (mainly France and Italy) to also relax import quotas for British goods in order to increase trade between Britain and Western Europe. For the same purpose, Britain held meetings with France and the Scandinavian countries in late April, and with West Germany and Belgium in mid-May, respectively, to discuss the implementation of "freer" payment methods and the expansion of trade. Britain and West Germany further signed a new payment agreement on May 22, stipulating that both parties can freely settle accounts in pounds sterling or West German marks. Britain also plans to conduct similar negotiations with Italy, Switzerland, and the Netherlands.

Britain is a large importer and a large exporter. Every year, it must import large quantities of grain, raw materials, and timber, etc., and offset the imports with large exports of industrial products. Before the Second World War, the Soviet Union, China, and Eastern European countries were important targets of British import and export trade. After the war, as a result of following the United States in restricting trade with the peaceful democratic camp, in 1951, Britain's trade with the democratic camp countries had been reduced to one-sixth of that in 1937. Therefore, Britain had to consume large amounts of gold and dollars to import the necessary grain and timber from the United States, which is the main reason for the British dollar shortage. Some of the British bourgeoisie and their political representatives once proposed "asking for trade" from the United States, fantasizing that this would solve Britain's dollar shortage problem. This is tantamount to "seeking a skin from a tiger." Since this path is blocked, the British bourgeoisie is now increasingly recognizing that only restoring trade with the traditional markets of the East is the real way out for Britain. The "Financial Times," which represents the interests of British big capitalists, said not long ago: Restoring trade between East and West "may ease the European dollar shortage somewhat. If the East exports more grain, timber, and coal, it would be very welcome." British businessmen were very active at the 14th Congress of the International Chamber of Commerce held in Vienna in May. A "New York Times" reporter reported that one of the most outstanding results of this meeting was that the prospect of expanding East-West trade seemed to have a more immediate hope of realization than the prospect of expanding trade with countries outside the peaceful democratic camp.

Under the demand of seeking alternative solutions, Britain also intends to develop relations within the Commonwealth and try to implement the "development plan" with its own strength, including developing the production of raw materials and food in the various Commonwealth member states to supply Britain and exchange for dollars, while Britain supplies them with the equipment and machinery they need. This will increase sales for British export goods and save dollar expenditure in the sterling area.

According to news reports, the issues to be discussed at the Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference held in London on the 3rd, in addition to diplomatic issues, are economic issues of the Commonwealth. Britain will request at the meeting to strengthen the economic "cooperation" of the Commonwealth countries and support Britain's adoption of foreign economic measures aimed at breaking free from the shackles of the dollar.

Xinhua News Agency, 4th Dispatch, London: Due to the intensification of competition in the capitalist world trade market, orders for major industrial sectors in Britain have been reduced.

According to the "Financial Times," orders for the British shipbuilding industry have decreased in the past few months. This phenomenon is also reflected in the machine tool and foundry industries - they are usually a reflection of overall industrial trends. The newspaper pointed out that some observers believe that this is "the first hint of a real post-war recession."

On May 12, Harold Watkinson, Parliamentary Secretary to the British Minister of Labour and National Service, warned in a speech in Liverpool that the problem facing Britain today is not a lack of raw materials, but a lack of orders. He said that part of the reason was the restrictions imposed by other countries on imports of British goods. According to the "Financial Times," Watkinson said that if Britain cannot maintain full competition in every world market, this lack of orders will soon develop to "a catastrophic degree." Watkinson also asked British businessmen to work hard to deal with a "trade situation that will be more difficult than anything Britain has encountered in the past twenty years."

    英美两国经济的矛盾越来越突出
    英国向美国“要贸易”碰了壁打算自找出路
    【新华社四日讯】为了解救由于奉行扩军备战和限制东西方贸易的政策所造成的严重的贸易和经济的危机，英国在去年十一月底与其他联邦成员国在伦敦举行了一次联邦总理经济会议。在这次会议上，讨论了联邦的“发展计划”，决定请求美国的帮助，包括：要美国减低关税，要美国以稳定价格长期向英镑区购买原料，要美国向英镑区投资以及要美国提高黄金价格等。
    今年三月初，英国外交大臣艾登和财政大臣巴特勒带着这些要求亲自到华盛顿和艾森豪威尔政府商量。但是他们是乘兴而去，败兴而返。美国一直是把操纵资本主义世界原料市场价格作为对别国特别是英国加施压力的一个手段的，因此在原料价格不断下跌情况下，对于英国提出的以稳定价格长期购买英国原料的要求自然是“不感兴趣”。在投资问题上，英国企望美国只出钱帮助英联邦开发资源，但美国却乘机要求英镑自由兑换以便利美国垄断资本打入英帝国领域；英国在“原则上”同意了逐渐实行自由兑换，但要求美国先贷予英国巨额美元作为兑换基金。对于这种滑头的生意经，从来一毛不拔的美国资本家当然没有同意。所以谈来谈去都是空话。英国的提高黄金价格的要求，牵动美国用压低黄金价格来使英国长期陷于储备不足状况的政策，美国更是干脆一口回绝。至于英国寄望最大的开放美国市场的问题，不但毫无解决之望，而且美国国内要求加强保护贸易措施的呼声反而愈来愈大。
    去年十一月英联邦总理经济会议上对美国所抱的幻想和希望破灭了，同时英国的财经危机有增无减，这就迫使英国不得不重打主意，一向亲美的英国“经济学家”杂志最近说：“某种‘次好的’计划似乎正在酝酿中”，这一计划就是“在欧洲范围内进行某种更自由的支付和贸易制度”。
    自从艾登和巴特勒从华盛顿败兴归来后，英国就进行了一系列的活动。首先是英国在三月二十四日宣布对西欧放宽入口定额，由百分之四十四增加到百分之五十八，同时并提高对西欧的旅行费外汇限额，目的在于换取西欧大陆方面（主要是法国和意大利）也放宽对英国货的入口限额，以增加英国和西欧间的贸易。为了同一目的，英国在四月下旬与法国和斯堪的纳维亚国家、五月中与西德和比利时分别举行了关于实行“更自由”的支付办法和扩大贸易的会议。英国和西德并进一步在五月二十二日签订一项新支付协定，规定双方可随意用英镑或西德马克清算。英国还计划与意大利、瑞士和荷兰等国进行同样的谈判。
    英国是一个大输入国家，也是一个大输出国家，每年必须输入大量粮食、原料和木材等等，而以输出大量工业制品抵补入口。在二次大战之前，苏联、中国及东欧国家是英国出入口贸易的重要对象。战后由于追随美国限制与和平民主阵营贸易的结果，在一九五一年英国和民主阵营国家所进行的贸易已减少到一九三七年的六分之一，因而英国不得不消耗大量黄金和美元从美国输入所需要的粮食和木材，这是造成英国美元荒的主要原因。英国一部分资产阶级及其政治代表曾提出向美国“要贸易”，幻想这样来解决英国的美元缺乏问题，这无异是“与虎谋皮”。此路既然不通，现在英国资产阶级正越来越认识到只有恢复对东方传统市场的贸易才是英国的真正出路。代表英国大资本家利益的“金融时报”不久以前就说过这样的话：恢复东西方之间的贸易“可能使欧洲美元荒缓和一些，如果东方输出更多的粮食、木材与煤的话，那是极受欢迎的”。在五月间在维也纳举行的国际商会第十四届代表大会上，英国的商人们甚为活跃。“纽约时报”记者曾报道这个会议说，这次会议最特出的结果之一是：扩大东西方贸易的前景似乎比与和平民主阵营以外的国家扩大贸易的前景，更加有马上实现的希望。
    在另谋出路的要求下，英国也打算发展联邦内部的关系，设法用自己的力量来实行“发展计划”，包括在各联邦成员国发展原料和粮食的生产量，用以供给英国和换取美元，英国则供给它们所需要的装备和机器，这样给英国的出口货物增加销路，同时又节省了英镑区的美元支出。
    据新闻报道，三日在伦敦召开的英联邦总理会议要讨论的问题，除了外交问题以外，就是联邦的经济问题；英国在会议上将要求加强联邦国家的经济“合作”，并支持英国采取目的在挣脱美元束缚的对外经济措施。
    【新华社四日讯】伦敦消息：由于资本主义世界贸易市场竞争的加剧，英国主要工业部门的订货已见减少。
    据“金融时报”报道，过去数月以来，英国造船工业的订货减少。这种现象同样表现在工作母机和铸造工业部门——它们通常是反映总的工业趋势的。该报指出，有些观察家认为这是“战后真正的衰退的头一个暗示”。
    五月十二日，英国劳工与国民役务部驻议会次官哈罗德·华金逊曾在利物浦发表演说警告说，今天摆在英国面前的问题不是缺少原料，而是缺少订货。他说部分原因是其他国家对英国货进口所实施的限制。据“金融时报”报道，华金逊说，如果英国在每个世界市场上不能保持充分竞争的话，这种缺少订货的现象不久将发展到“灾难性的程度”。华金逊还要求英国商人出力应付一个“将较英国二十年来碰到过的任何情况更为困难的贸易情况”。
