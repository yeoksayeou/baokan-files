Xinhua News Agency, Montevideo dispatch: Brazilian business circles have recently demanded the opening of new markets and advocated the establishment of trade relations with all countries without exception. According to "People's News," manufacturers in the state of São Paulo held a gathering at which they unanimously passed a resolution requesting that the possibility of establishing mutually beneficial trade between Brazil and those regions that have not yet established international relations with Brazil be studied as soon as possible. A member of the manufacturers' delegation from Minas Gerais state said, when discussing this issue, that manufacturers are very interested in resuming trade with the Soviet Union.

"People's News" also mentioned that the Pernambuco State Legislative Assembly unanimously adopted a suggestion put forward by parliamentarian Paulo Cavalcanti, which requested that the sugar and alcoholic beverage production and distribution control agency should consider all applications from countries wishing to buy sugar from Brazil, "without discrimination due to political or ideological differences." "People's News" pointed out that the decision of the Pernambuco State Legislative Assembly was welcomed by sugarcane factory owners and national business circles, who believe that this is a way to solve the widespread crisis in the northeastern states of Brazil. "People's News" said: "The number of important industrialists and businessmen who advocate the resumption of trade with the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China and other people's democratic countries is increasing day by day. From the perspective of national interests, this is necessary."

    巴西企业界要求开辟新市场
    主张和所有国家建立贸易关系
    【新华社十六日讯】塔斯社蒙得维的亚讯：巴西企业界人士最近要求开辟新市场，并主张毫无例外地与所有国家建立贸易关系。据“人民报”说，圣保罗州制造商举行了一次集会，会上一致通过决议，要求在最近就开始研究巴西和那些尚未与巴西发生国际关系的地区建立互惠贸易的可能性。米纳斯吉拉斯州制造商代表团的一位团员谈到这个问题时说，制造商对于恢复与苏联的贸易很感兴趣。
    “人民报”也谈到，伯南布哥州立法议会一致通过了议员保罗·卡瓦尔康蒂所提出的一项建议，这项建议要求糖类和酒类饮料生产分配管制机构应考虑所有国家想向巴西买糖的申请，“不应因政治或思想的不同而有所歧视”。“人民报”指出，伯南布哥州立法议会的决定，受到蔗糖制造厂厂主和全国企业界人士的欢迎，他们认为这是解决巴西东北部各州普遍存在的危机的办法。“人民报”说：“主张与苏联、中华人民共和国和其他人民民主国家恢复贸易的重要工商界人士一天比一天多。从国家利益着想，这样做是必要的。”
