Xinhua News Agency, Rome, June 11th: The results of the Italian parliamentary elections show that the democratic forces have achieved a greater victory than in the Senate elections. The Gasperi government's painstakingly arranged conspiracy to seize two-thirds of the seats in the lower house has been completely thwarted.

According to the officially announced results of the lower house elections, out of a total of 27,089,184 valid votes, the Communist Party and the Socialist Party jointly obtained 9,562,860 votes, accounting for 35 percent of the total, approximately 1,570,000 votes more than in the last general election in 1948.

Gasperi's Christian Democratic Party, relying on its power, US dollars, and the interference of the Vatican Church, obtained 10,859,554 votes, losing nearly 2 million votes compared to the last general election. Adding the Republican Party, the Liberal Party, and the Social Democratic Party, etc., which formed an "alliance" with it, the total was only 13,487,038 votes, accounting for 49.8 percent of the total, less than half. Therefore, the so-called electoral system "reform" law, which Gasperi strenuously forced through parliament before the election, suffered a shameful bankruptcy. According to the "reform" law, a party alliance that obtained more than 50 percent of the total votes (even one vote more than half) could obtain 65 percent of the parliamentary seats. This unreasonable method was adopted by the ruling Christian Democratic Party, knowing that it was becoming increasingly unpopular, in an attempt to use this method to gain a two-thirds majority in parliament for itself, in order to further undermine the constitution and drag Italy into the American "European Defense Group."

In order to ensure obtaining more than half of the votes, the Christian Democratic Party wooed several small parties begging for its leftovers to form a so-called electoral "alliance." During the election campaign, the Christian Democratic Party used its power to restrict and undermine the opposition's campaigning in many ways, and violated the law by mobilizing the entire church machinery to influence the universally religious voters in Italy, forcing them to vote for the "alliance." On the eve of the election, the US government openly interfered, instructing its ambassador to Italy, Luce, to announce that if the Christian Democratic Party did not obtain a majority, the United States would no longer give Italy US dollars, while also stating that the United States was preparing to give Italy another 22.2 million US dollars. During the election, the Christian Democratic Party also used various means of corruption and malpractice. But all this failed to save its decline.

According to the new election results, the Christian Democratic Party and its "allies" can obtain a total of 303 seats (of which the Christian Democratic Party obtained 261 seats). Not only was the two-thirds target not achieved, but their original number of seats was reduced by 68. On the other hand, the United Democratic Forces of the Communist Party and the Socialist Party increased their seats in the lower house by 35, reaching 218 seats (Communist Party 143 seats, Socialist Party 75 seats). The total number of seats in the lower house is 590. The remaining seats are distributed as follows: Royalist Party 40 seats, new fascist organization "Italian Social Movement" 29 seats.

However, there are signs that the Italian government is still attempting to salvage its failure by shameless means. Interior Minister Scelba, in announcing the election results, stated that he was prepared to re-examine 1.3 million rejected ballots. In any case, the so-called electoral system "reform" law has become a sharp irony for the Gasperi government and its American masters. The significance of this irony is confirmed by the feigned calm comments in the newspapers of the American ruling group. The "New York Herald Tribune" admitted that the election result was "disappointing." The "New York Times" said: "One must admit that the democratic group did not achieve a complete victory in the lower house, which is a great pity."

Xinhua News Agency, Rome, June 11th: TASS, Rome, June 11th: "Unità" published an article written by Togliatti before the final results of the lower house elections were announced. The article said:

"The publication of the election results is unusually slow and very suspicious, but from the election results that have already been published, one can draw a clear, definite, and undeniable conclusion: the Italian Communist Party has achieved a new and great victory beyond all expectations. For more than five years, Italy has been under the rule of reactionary parties and governments, who have openly declared that their primary goal is to destroy the Communist Party, or at least to isolate it from the masses of the people; for more than five years, anti-communism has been the policy pursued by all ruling authorities, and the reason for all kinds of persecution and brutal acts against us. However, after such five years, we remain the strongest, most united, and most powerful democratic party on the Italian political stage.

"The progressive, healthy, and upright majority of the people have united around us and cast their votes for us. Let the reactionary groups and the leaders of the Christian Democratic Party and its allied parties learn the lesson they deserve from this election! Persecution and injustice, wanton slander and shameless tyranny cannot stop us from advancing, cannot turn the wheels of history. ... Our victory is a victory for the struggle for peace, democracy, and socialism. Therefore, all upright Italians will be happy because of this victory.

"We want to tell the people of the whole country that the great strength of our party will, as before, be entirely at the service of the highest interests of the people. Regardless of the situation that will arise in the parliament and the country after the June 7th elections, we communists, who have no selfish desires and do not harbor old grudges, will always be faithful to the only hope—striving for the establishment of a stable and peaceful Italian government, guaranteeing all citizens a free and happy future."

    意大利民主力量获得重大的胜利
    陶里亚蒂撰文论意共在选举中胜利的意义
    【新华社十一日讯】罗马消息：意大利下院选举结果，民主力量比在上院选举中获得了更大的胜利，加斯贝利政府费尽心机安排的夺取下院三分之二多数席位的阴谋彻底破产。
    据官方公布的下院选举结果，在全部有效选票二千七百零八万九千一百八十四票中，共产党和社会党共得票九百五十六万二千八百六十票，占总数的百分之三十五，比一九四八年上次大选多得约一百五十七万票。
    加斯贝利的天主教民主党靠了它的政权、美元和梵蒂冈教会的干涉，获得一千零八十五万九千五百五十四票，较上次大选丧失了将近二百万票；加上和它结成“联盟”的共和党、自由党和社会民主党等等，总共也只得一千三百四十八万七千零三十八票，合总数的百分之四十九点八，不到一半。因此，加斯贝利在选举前化尽了力气强行在议会通过的所谓选举制“改革”法遭到了可耻的破产。按“改革”法规定，获得总票数的百分之五十以上的票数（比一半多一票也行）的党派联盟就可以获得百分之六十五的议席。这种无理的办法是执政的天主教民主党知道自己日益不得人心，想凭借这种办法来给自己取得在议会的三分之二多数，以便进一步破坏宪法，把意大利拉进美国的“欧洲防务集团”。
    为了保证得到过半数选票，天主教民主党拉拢几个乞讨它的残羹冷饭的小党派，结成所谓选举“联盟”。在竞选期间，天主教民主党利用政权力量多方限制和破坏反对力量的竞选，并且违反法律，动员了整个教会机器来影响意大利普遍信教的选民，强迫他们投“联盟”的票。在选举前夕美国政府曾进行公开的干涉，指示它驻意大利大使卢斯宣布，如果不让天主教民主党获得多数，美国就要不再给意大利美元，同时又表示美国正准备再给意大利二千二百万美元。在选举中间，天主教民主党又运用了各种行私舞弊的手段。但是所有这一切，都没有能够挽救它的颓势。
    按照新选举的结果，天主教民主党和它的“联盟”者共可分得三百零三席（其中天主教民主党得二百六十一席），不但三分之二的目标未曾达到，而且比它们原有席位还减少了六十八席。另一方面，共产党和社会党的联合民主力量在下院所拥有的席位却增加了三十五席，达到二百一十八席（共产党一百四十三席、社会党七十五席）。下院总席位是五百九十席。其他的席位分配是：保皇党四十席，新的法西斯组织“意大利社会运动”二十九席。
    但是，有迹象显示，意大利政府仍在企图以无耻的手段挽回它的失败，内政部长谢尔巴在宣布选举结果时表示准备重新检查为数达一百三十万张的废票。不论如何，所谓选举制“改革”法已成为对加斯贝利政府和它的美国主子的尖锐讽刺。这一讽刺的重大意义从美国统治集团报纸的故作镇静的评论中得到反证。“纽约先驱论坛报”承认选举结果是 “令人失望的”。“纽约时报”说：“人们必须承认，民主集团在下院没有得到完全胜利，是一大憾事。”
    【新华社十一日讯】据塔斯社罗马十一日讯：“团结报”发表了陶里亚蒂在下院选举的最后结果公布前所写的一篇文章。文章说：
    “选举结果的发表慢得有点不平常而且很令人怀疑，可是由已经发表的选举结果中，人们可以得出一个清楚、明确的、无可争辩的结论：意大利共产党取得了超出一切预料之外的新的伟大的胜利。五年多以来，意大利一直在反动的党派和政府的统治之下，他们公开宣布过，他们的首要目的是摧毁共产党，至少是要使共产党在人民群众中陷于孤立；五年多以来，反共一直是一切执政当局奉行的方针，也是对我们进行的各种迫害和残暴行为的原因。然而，经过这样的五年以后，我们在意大利政治舞台上依然是最强大、最团结、最有实力的民主政党。
    “进步的、健康的和正直的大多数人民已经团结在我们周围，并投了我们的票。让反动集团和天主教民主党及其同盟党派的领导人从这次大选中取得应有的教训吧！迫害和不公正、肆意诽谤和无耻的专横都不能阻止我们前进，不能扭转历史的车轮。……我们的胜利是为了争取和平、民主与社会主义而取得的胜利。所以，所有正直的意大利人都会因为这次胜利而感到高兴。
    “我们要告诉全国人民，我们党的伟大力量在今后将像以前一样完全为人民的最高利益服务。不管在六月七日的选举后议会和全国将产生怎样的局势，我们没有私利愿望、不怀宿怨旧恨的共产党人，将永远忠实于唯一的希望——争取成立一个稳定的、和平的意大利政府，保证所有的公民获得一个自由、幸福的未来。”
