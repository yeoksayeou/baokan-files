    Mendès France Fails to Form Cabinet
    French Government Crisis Continues
    [Xinhua News Agency, June 6th] Paris Dispatch: The French National Assembly has refused to authorize Pierre Mendès France to form a government.
    After Mendès France delivered a policy address in the National Assembly on the 3rd, members of various parties raised a series of questions regarding domestic and foreign affairs, demanding clear answers from Mendès France. In his speech, the representative of the Communist parliamentary group, G. Plissonnier, pointed out: There is something new in Mendès France's speech, which is that he recognizes France's dependence on the United States and expresses the hope to get rid of the shackles that subordinate French policy to the United States to some extent. Plissonnier asked Mendès France: Does he intend to propose peace negotiations to the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam? Does he intend to recognize People's China? What attitude will he take towards the anti-communist conspiracies of the French reactionaries?
    Apparently succumbing to the pressure of right-wing reactionary forces, Mendès France departed from certain ideas he expressed in his policy address in his reply. He interrupted the debate among the members twice, declaring that he would continue the Indochina colonial war and that he would send a high commissioner with broader powers to implement his policies. He repeatedly praised the "unprecedentedly generous assistance" of the United States and assured that his government would continue to support the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. He said that his advocacy of strengthening ties with Britain did not mean weakening ties with the United States. He also insisted on amending the constitution.
    The authorization vote was held on the evening of the 4th. The results of the vote were 301 in favor and 119 against (including the Communist Party, the Republican Union for Progress, and others). Mendès France did not obtain the majority stipulated by the constitution—314 votes.
    Jacques Duclos, chairman of the French Communist Party parliamentary group, pointed out in his speech during the debate: The reason why France has lost its independence and suffered economic bankruptcy lies in the disastrous policies pursued by the majority parties in the government after the Communist Party was excluded from the government in 1947. He emphasized that a policy that is in line with the national interests of France should be: to stop the Vietnam War, abandon colonial oppression, refuse to ratify the Bonn and Paris war treaties, conclude a peace treaty with a unified Germany, resolve outstanding international issues through negotiation, drastically reduce military spending and restore a peaceful economy, improve the material conditions of the working masses, and respect democratic freedoms and the constitution. He also emphasized the necessity of developing trade relations with the Soviet Union, China, and the People's Democracies.

### 孟戴斯—弗朗斯组阁失败  法国政府危机延续中

    孟戴斯—弗朗斯组阁失败
    法国政府危机延续中
    【新华社六日讯】巴黎消息：法国国民议会已拒绝授权皮埃尔·孟戴斯—弗朗斯组织政府。
    孟戴斯—弗朗斯三日在国民议会发表政策演说后，各党派议员提出了关于内政、外交各方面的一连串问题，要求孟戴斯—弗朗斯给予明确答复。共产党议会党团代表歇·普朗多在发言中指出：孟戴斯—弗朗斯的演说里有一点新的东西，就是他承认法国处于依赖美国的地位，并且表示希望在某种程度上摆脱那种使法国政策从属于美国的束缚。普朗多问孟戴斯—弗朗斯：是不是打算向越南民主共和国政府提出和平谈判的建议？是不是打算承认人民中国？对于法国反动派的反共阴谋采取什么态度？
    显然是屈服于右翼反动势力的压力，孟戴斯—弗朗斯在答辩中离开了他在政策演说中所表示的某些观念。他曾两次打断议员们的辩论，声明他要继续进行印度支那殖民战争，并说他还要派一个具有更广泛的权力的高级专员来执行他的政策。他不止一次地歌颂美国“空前慷慨的援助”，并且保证他的政府要继续支持北大西洋公约。他说，他主张加强和英国的联系，并不是说要削弱和美国的联系。他还坚持修改宪法。
    授权投票在四日晚举行。表决结果，三百零一票赞成，一百一十九票反对（包括共产党，进步共和联盟及其他）。孟戴斯—弗朗斯没有获得宪法所规定的过半数——三百一十四票。
    法国共产党议会党团主席杜克洛在辩论时曾发言，指出：使法国丧失独立和经济破产的原因，就在于一九四七年共产党被排挤出政府之后政府多数派政党所推行的祸国殃民的政策。他强调，符合于法国民族利益的政策应该是：停止越南战争，放弃殖民地压迫，拒绝批准波恩及巴黎战争条约，和统一的德国缔结和约，以谈判方法解决国际间悬而未决的问题，大量削减军费并恢复和平经济，改善劳动群众的物质情况，尊重民主自由和宪法。他还强调发展与苏联、中国及人民民主国家的贸易关系的必要。
