Fully Consider the Nutritional Value When Processing Rice and Flour
Director of the Department of Nutrition, Central Institute of Hygiene, Yang Enfu

Some grain processing plants, in order to earn more money, cater to the psychology of some consumers and inappropriately increase the processing precision of rice and flour. This not only wastes a lot of food, but also seriously endangers human health. Because if people often eat refined white rice and flour, they will develop beriberi. Patients with acute beriberi often die because they cannot be treated. Although patients with mild beriberi do not necessarily have to be bedridden, they are prone to fatigue and weakness, which greatly reduces their ability to work.

Why does eating refined white rice and flour often cause beriberi? Because rice and wheat originally contain extremely rich Vitamin B1, which prevents beriberi. Most of this vitamin is found in brown rice or the germ and outer layers of wheat. Excessive processing of rice and flour completely removes the germ and outer layers, and most of this important nutrient is lost as a result. According to the analysis results of the Central Institute of Hygiene in the past three years, on average, each catty of brown rice contains 1.6 mg of Vitamin B1, while refined white rice only contains 0.25 mg. Each catty of wheat contains 2.0 mg of Vitamin B1, while refined white flour only contains 0.35 mg.

Ordinary adults need about 1.5 mg of Vitamin B1 per day, and those who do more physical labor need more. Of course, part of this requirement can be supplied by non-staple foods, but in general, the non-staple foods supply little more than one-third of the total requirement, i.e., 0.5 mg (people who eat a lot of other foods containing Vitamin B1 are naturally an exception). The remaining 1.0 mg must be supplied by staple foods. Therefore, the amount of Vitamin B1 in staple foods becomes the determining factor in whether a person suffers from beriberi. In areas where millet is the staple food, beriberi naturally does not occur because millet is extremely rich in Vitamin B1 (containing 3.0 mg per catty). People who eat brown rice and whole wheat flour will also not get this disease, because the Vitamin B1 contained in one catty of brown rice or whole wheat flour has exceeded the daily requirement of each person. If the staple food is entirely refined white rice or refined white flour, even if the Vitamin B1 supplied by the non-staple food can reach the general maximum amount of 0.5 mg, it will not meet the total requirement when combined with the staple food.

Given this, does it mean that we should advocate eating brown rice and whole wheat flour? No. It is still necessary to remove the bran from rice and wheat appropriately. From a storage point of view, brown rice and whole wheat flour are prone to spoilage and mold. From a nutritional point of view, unprocessed grains are more difficult to digest, and the indigestible part cannot be absorbed by the human body, so it is also a loss. Nutritionists have done many experiments and believe that it is most appropriate to remove 5% of the bran from both rice and wheat.

According to the analysis results, each catty of "August 1st Flour" contains 1.25 mg of Vitamin B1, and each catty of "September 2nd Rice" contains 0.70 mg of Vitamin B1. If a person eats 1.5 catties of "August 1st Flour" every day, they can get 1.87 mg of Vitamin B1, which is enough without even counting the part supplied by non-staple food. 1.5 catties of "September 2nd Rice" contains 1.05 mg, plus 0.5 mg supplied by non-staple food, for a total of 1.52 mg, which is just enough for the requirement.

The above figures are calculated based on uncooked food. During the cooking process, vitamins are often lost to some extent. The amount of loss depends on the cooking method. When steaming buns and baking pancakes, the loss of vitamins in the flour is not very significant, only about 20%, so the remaining amount is still sufficient for human needs. When boiling noodles, some vitamins dissolve in the soup, and if the soup is discarded, the loss is relatively large. Generally speaking, eating "August 1st Flour" can provide enough Vitamin B1. From this, we can see that increasing the whiteness of flour is harmful to human health.

The situation is somewhat different with "September 2nd Rice." Ordinary rice is not clean enough during manufacturing, and some is even added with polishing powder, so people often wash it with water and rub it by hand before cooking, until the washed water is no longer turbid. This completely washes away the fine bran and germ in the rice. According to research results, the vitamins contained in rice lost due to this reason range from 50% to 80%. Therefore, in the future, attention should be paid to keeping the rice clean during processing and transportation, and polishing powder should not be used, so that it is not necessary to over-wash the rice before cooking.

In order to maintain good health, in wheat-eating areas, if conditions permit, it is best to eat one meal of "August 1st Flour" a day, and the rest eat miscellaneous grains. In the rice-eating areas of southern China, it is possible to advocate eating parboiled rice. This type of rice is made in the areas bordering Jiangsu and Zhejiang and in some rural areas of Guangdong and Fujian. The "fire rice" eaten by Tibetans is also a type of parboiled rice. According to analysis, each catty of parboiled rice or "fire rice" contains about 1.3 mg of Vitamin B1, which is twice that of "September 2nd Rice." Parboiled rice not only has a high vitamin content, but also loses only 10% during washing, and less is lost during cooking.

In order to save food, parboiled rice should also be promoted. Because the loss of broken rice is small when removing the bran, the yield of whole rice grains can generally increase by about 10%. At the same time, this type of rice is also easier to store than ordinary rice and is not prone to heat and mold. Therefore, although manufacturing parboiled rice will increase some costs, the yield of whole rice is high and the loss is small, which is sufficient to offset the manufacturing costs and more.

There are many methods for making parboiled rice. In some areas, the rice is boiled in hot water for a short period of time, soaked in cold water for three hours, and then steamed for half an hour. Some directly steam it, eliminating the soaking procedure. The rice treated in this way is dried in the sun before being shelled and debranned.

The above only mentions the problem of Vitamin B1 contained in rice and wheat flour. Overly refined processing of rice and flour will also cause other nutrients to be lost to varying degrees. We hope that the grain processing industry will not only focus on making money and cater to the preferences of some people by inappropriately increasing the processing precision of rice and flour, without considering the health of the people. We also hope that the grain processing industry can further research and improve processing methods, not only to suit people's tastes, but also to pay attention to improving nutritional value and saving food for the country.

### 加工米面时应充分注意它的营养价值

    加工米面时应充分注意它的营养价值
    中央卫生研究院营养学系主任  杨恩孚
    有些粮食加工厂为了赚得较多的钱，竟迎合一部分消费者的心理，不适当地提高米、面加工精度。这不仅浪费了大量的食粮，还严重地危害了人体的健康。因为人若常常食用精白米、面，就会发生脚气病。急性脚气病患者往往因为无法治疗而死亡。轻度的脚气病患者虽然不至于卧床不起，但是容易使人疲倦无力，大大减低了工作能力。
    为什么常吃精白米、面会产生脚气病呢？因为米、麦里原来含有极为丰富的防治脚气病的一号乙种维生素，这种维生素绝大部分存在于糙米或小麦的胚芽和外层中。米、面过度加工，将胚芽和外层完全去净，这种重要的营养成分绝大部分也就随着损失。据中央卫生研究院近三年来分析的结果，平均每斤糙米含有一号乙种维生素一·六毫克，精白米只含○·二五毫克。每斤小麦含有一号乙种维生素二·○毫克，精白面只含有○·三五毫克。
    普通的成年人每天需要一号乙种维生素一·五毫克左右，体力劳动越多的人，需要的越多。当然，这个需要量的一部分可以由副食供给，但在一般情况下，副食所供给的很少超过全部需要量的三分之
    一，即○·五毫克（大量食用其他含有一号乙种维生素食品的人，自然是例外）。所差的一·○毫克，就必须靠主食来供给。因此，主食里一号乙种维生素的含量多少，就成为人是否患脚气病的决定因素。以小米为主食的地区，因小米里含有极为丰富的一号乙种维生素（每一斤里含有三·○毫克），自然不会得脚气病。吃糙米和全麦粉的人，也不会得这种病，因为一斤糙米或全麦粉所含的一号乙种维生素，已经超过了每人一天的需要量。假如主食完全是精白米或者是精白面，即使副食所供给的一号乙种维生素能够达到一般最高量○·五毫克，但和主食合起来，也达不到需要量的全部。
    既然这样，那是不是说应该提倡吃糙米和全麦粉呢？不是的。米、麦适度地去糠还是必要的。从储藏来讲，糙米和全麦粉容易变坏发霉。从营养来讲，没有加过工的粮食比较不容易消化，而不能消化的部分就不能为人体所吸收，因此也是损失。营养学家曾作过许多试验，认为无论是大米或者是小麦，以去糠百分之五最为适宜。
    据分析结果，每斤“八一粉”所含的一号乙种维生素有一·二五毫克，每斤“九二米”含有一号乙种维生素○·七○毫克。一个人如果每天吃一斤半
    “八一粉”，就可以得到一·八七毫克一号乙种维生素，不必算上副食所供给的部分，已够需要。一斤半“九二米”含有一·○五毫克，加上副食所供给的○·五毫克，共有一·五二毫克，刚够需要量。
    上面的数字是根据没有烹饪过的食物来计算的。在烹饪过程中，维生素往往会受到一些损失。损失的多少，要看烹饪的方法而定。蒸馒头和烙饼时，面粉里的维生素损失不很多，大约只损失百分之二十左右，因此所剩余的，仍够人体的需要。煮面条时，一部分维生素溶解在汤里，如果丢了汤，则损失量比较大些。一般来说食用“八一面”可以得到足够的一号乙种维生素。由此我们可以看出：提高面粉的精白度，是对人体健康有妨碍的。
     “九二米”的情形就有些不同了。普通的米，因制造时候不够清洁，有些还加了光粉，所以一般人在做饭以前，常常要用水冲洗，用手搓磨，直到洗的水不再混浊为止。这样便将米里的细糠皮和胚芽完全洗掉。据研究的结果，米里所含的维生素由于这个原因所损失的，在百分之五十到百分之八十。因此今后在加工和运输稻米时，要注意保持大米的清洁，不要用光粉，这样煮饭前就可以不必过度地搓洗了。
    为了保持身体的健康，在食麦地区，如果条件许可，最好一天吃一顿“八一粉”，其余吃杂粮。在我国南部食大米区，则可以提倡吃蒸谷米。我国江浙交界地区和广东、福建一些农村中都会作这种米。藏民吃的“火米”也是蒸谷米的一种。据分析，每斤蒸谷米或者“火米”含有一号乙种维生素一·三毫克左右，为“九二米”的一倍。蒸谷米的维生素不但含量高，在洗米时的损失也只有百分之十，煮的时候损失的也少。
    为了节省食粮，也应当提倡蒸谷米。因为在去糠的时候，碎米的损失少，整米粒的产量，普通可以增加百分之十左右。同时这种米也较普通米易于储藏，不易发热发霉。因此虽然制造蒸谷米要增加些成本，但是整米的产量高，损失少，足可以抵偿制造费用而有余。
    制造蒸谷米的方法很多。有的地区用热水将谷子煮一个很短的时期，用冷水泡三小时后，蒸半小时。有的就直接蒸，省去泡的手续。这样处理过的谷子，用日光晒干后再去壳去糠。
    上面所提到的，只是关于稻米和麦面中所含一号乙种维生素的问题。米面加工过精，同样也会使其他的营养成分有不同程度的损失。我们希望粮食加工业不要只顾赚钱，就投合一些人的偏好，不适当地提高米面加工精度，而不考虑人民的身体健康。更希望粮食加工业能够进一步研究和改善加工方法，不但要适合人民的口味，而且也要注意提高营养价值，并为国家节约粮食。
