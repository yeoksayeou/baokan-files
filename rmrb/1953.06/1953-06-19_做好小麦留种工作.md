    Do a Good Job of Wheat Seed Retention
    In the past, many regions of our country had insufficient wheat seed reserves. This year, wheat production has decreased in Anhui, Henan, Shandong, Jiangsu, Shanxi and other places due to frost damage, so more attention must be paid to the issue of wheat seed reserves. In the past, some areas often reduced planting areas and reduced the amount of seeds sown per unit area due to insufficient seed retention, or transferred seeds from long distances that were not necessarily suitable for local planting, causing great losses to production. This year, we must organize and plan to guide the masses to do a good job in retaining wheat seeds, so as to avoid particularly serious difficulties when planting wheat in the fall.
    The fact that agricultural leadership agencies in some areas do not pay attention to seed retention is inseparable from the blind and rash tendency in the popularization of improved varieties. Many agricultural workers only pay attention to "improving varieties" and ignore local farmer varieties, blindly purchasing seeds from other places. This practice is wrong. Some seeds from other places are not improved varieties, and some, although improved varieties, are mixed during transportation and distribution. Some, although improved varieties in Place A, are not suitable for the natural conditions of Place B, thus causing the phenomenon of "improved varieties being not good," causing the state and people to suffer a lot of losses.
    This year, all localities should pay attention to selecting and retaining good local wheat seeds. In this work, we must pay attention to the following issues:
    1. In disaster-stricken areas, try to keep wheat seeds as much as possible and do not eat them. To this end, we must first do a good job in food regulation and help the masses plant early-maturing crops such as melons and vegetables to solve the problem of food before the autumn harvest.
    2. Use examples to educate the masses on seed retention. This year, some areas suffered particularly serious frost damage because they used wheat seeds transferred from other places when sowing last autumn. These facts should be used to make the masses realize the danger of not retaining seeds and purchasing seeds from other places when sowing. In areas affected by frost disasters, it is generally found that densely planted wheat is less affected and recovers faster; in areas not affected by disasters, densely planted wheat generally has higher yields. These facts should be used to make the masses realize that dense planting is indeed beneficial and to retain more wheat seeds than in the past in preparation for dense planting.
    3. In areas affected by frost damage, pests and diseases, some wheat is less affected; these wheats have proven to be varieties with strong resistance to frost and pests and diseases. In areas not affected by disasters, some wheat varieties have had higher yields for many years. Farmers should be advised to store these wheats separately and select full-grained ones as seeds. In all localities, some farmers and some local areas have suffered less disaster from wheat. The masses should be led to exchange seeds on the principle of voluntary mutual benefit. The ratio of wheat used for seeds to ordinary edible wheat should be decided by the masses themselves through consultation, and cadres at all levels should not make unified mandatory regulations. When there are not many high-quality seeds, we can advocate planting these small amounts of high-quality seeds in seed retention areas, and then using them for large-field planting after propagation. It is absolutely impossible to be greedy for more and quicker results and demand that enough high-quality seeds for large-field planting be selected all at once. The work of evaluating improved varieties, retaining seeds and exchanging seeds should preferably be carried out within a smaller scope.
    4. After the seeds are retained, pay attention to proper storage. In the past, many good seeds were of reduced quality and reduced germination rate due to improper storage. The masses have experience in storing wheat seeds. Rural work cadres and technical guidance personnel should consult with the masses well, summarize and promote these experiences.

### 做好小麦留种工作

    做好小麦留种工作
    我国许多地区过去就有储留麦种不足的现象。今年安徽、河南、山东、江苏、山西等地小麦受冻减产，对于储留麦种问题更须加以注意。过去某些地区常因留种不足，减少播种面积，减少单位面积播种量，或者远程调运不一定适合本地种植的种籽，使生产受到很大的损失。今年必须有组织有计划地领导群众把留存麦种工作做好，以免秋天种麦时候发生特别严重的困难。
    有些地区的农业领导机关不重视留种工作，是和良种普及工作中的盲目冒进倾向分不开的。许多农业工作人员只重视“改良品种”，忽视当地农家品种，盲目地到外地收购种籽，这种作法是错误的。有些外地种籽本来不是良种，有些虽是良种，但在调运分配途中混杂了，有些虽在甲地是良种，但不适合乙地的自然条件，因此造成“良种不良”的现象，使国家人民都受了不少损失。
    今年各地都应注意选留当地的好麦种。在这个工作中要注意这样几个问题：
    一、在受灾地区，尽量想法把麦种留下来，不要吃掉。为此，首先要做好粮食调剂工作，并帮助群众种植瓜菜等早熟作物，解决秋收前的食粮问题。
    二、要用实例对群众进行留种的教育工作。今年有若干地区因为去秋播种时用的是从外地调运来的麦种，遭受冻害特别严重；应当用这些事实使群众认识不留种籽，到播种时购买外地种籽的危险性。在遭受冻灾的地区，普遍发现密植的麦子受害较轻、恢复较快；未受灾的地区，密植的麦子一般产量较高；应当用这些事实使群众认识密植确有好处，适当地比过去多留一些麦种，以备实行密植。
    三、在遭受冻害、病虫害的地区，有些麦子受害较轻；这些麦子已证明是抗冻力、抗病虫力较强的品种。未受灾害的地区，有些麦子品种连年有较高的产量。应当劝农民把这些麦子分开储存，选出籽粒饱满的作为种籽。各地都有一些农户、一些局部地区的麦子受灾较轻，应该领导群众在自愿互利的原则下互换种籽。作种籽用的麦子和一般食用的麦子互换的比率，应由群众自己协商决定，各级干部不应作统一的强制的规定。优良种籽不多时，可提倡把这少量的良种种在留种地里，经繁殖后再作大田播种之用。切不可贪多求快，要求一下子选够大田播种用的优良种籽。评选良种，留种换种的工作，最好在较小的范围内进行。
    四、种籽留下以后，还要注意妥善贮存。过去有不少好的种籽因贮存不当而降低了质量，减低了发芽率。群众在贮存麦种方面是有经验的，农村工作干部和技术指导人员应当很好地和群众商量，把这些经验加以总结和推广。
