To the Second National Congress of the All-China Youth Federation
Greetings from Piero Pieralli, Secretary of the World Federation of Democratic Youth

Dear friends!

I extend greetings on behalf of the World Federation of Democratic Youth, representing 75 million young men and women in 88 countries, to the Second National Congress of the All-China Youth Federation.

You are gathered together to summarize the struggles and work you have done in the years since the First Congress. Your Congress will point out to the youth of China how to move further forward in the construction of the new China and how to make greater contributions to the cause of peace in Asia and the world.

Peace is the issue of greatest concern to the world's youth and is deeply desired by all people. Allow me to remind you that the World Peace Council will be holding a meeting within these very days. Without a doubt, it will issue great instructions to the people of the world, so that they may fight more resolutely for peace in the current international situation.

In the period since the World People's Peace Congress, a trend to try to ease the dangerous international situation has risen in the broadest strata of the world, due to the growing will for peace among the masses of people in every country.

The people and youth of the world warmly welcome the statements made by the heads of state and government leaders of the world's major powers, which state that there is no international dispute that cannot be resolved peacefully.

Everyone believes that the agreement signed in Korea on the issue of prisoner of war repatriation is a great victory for peace and applauds it, because this agreement marks an important stage in the process of achieving a ceasefire in Korea, which is what all the people and youth of the world expect through negotiation.

Undoubtedly, this is a preliminary sign that our cause of peace can be victorious, and we are contributing to this cause with the high enthusiasm of our youth.

Today, we are more convinced than ever that the forces of peace will prevail. However, we know that the deadly enemies of peace will not give up after their initial setbacks and failures. If we want to make a greater contribution to the cause of safeguarding peace, thereby ensuring a happy and joyful future for all young people, we must strengthen the mobilization of young people, we must unite young people more widely to defend peace. After the agreement of June 8 was obtained due to the will of the people of the world, first and foremost the people of Korea and China, to demand peace, we should continue to be vigilant and strengthen our efforts to defend peace. That is why the youth of the world will warmly welcome the resolutions of the World Peace Council and dedicate all their strength to their implementation in their work. Through the great events of the Third World Youth Congress and the Fourth World Festival of Youth and Students for Peace and Friendship, which will be held this summer, young people will make a great contribution to the cause of peace. These activities will mark a new and important stage on the road to world youth solidarity. Young people of all different countries, different races, and different ideas will unite in brotherhood in the will for peace and friendship, demanding an end to the international tension that makes their future uncertain, and demanding a halt to the arms race that is now causing them suffering in their lives. As a first step towards world peace, young men and women demand an end to the Korean War, which has brought irreparable losses to the property and lives of the people, in preparation for the above-mentioned Congress and Festival. More and more young people believe that the Korean War can be resolved peacefully. Without a doubt, after the signing of the June 8 agreement, the youth of the world will further strengthen the struggle for peace, and in the preparation for the Festival and the World Youth Congress, these great activities for peace, the solidarity of youth will be greatly strengthened. Whether in terms of the personnel involved, in the expression of the festival, or in the holding of discussions, the Congress and the Festival will have a more different and new nature of united gatherings than ever before.

Participating in this Congress will be representatives of member organizations and non-member organizations of the World Federation of Democratic Youth, representatives of organizations whose views are not entirely the same as those of the World Federation of Democratic Youth, but who believe that the significance of the Congress lies in providing an opportunity for young people of different tendencies to have sincere discussions on the pressing issues of the younger generation.

This Festival will have the same broad nature, with the nature of expressing the solidarity of young men and women, who have various different and divergent views on many issues, but who all agree on peace, friendship, respect for the rights of youth, and the freedom of all countries to conduct economic, cultural and sports exchanges.

The World Federation of Democratic Youth has organized a variety of activities for all young people who desire peace, with the aim of defending peace and promoting friendship, conducting discussions, making contacts and cooperating with each other. This proves that the World Federation of Democratic Youth is faithfully adhering to its purpose of uniting the youth of the world.

We are proud to warmly support these principles. These principles are gaining new strength every day, as evidenced by the widespread participation of young people from various countries in the Festival and the World Youth Congress. In France, in Italy, in the United Kingdom, as well as in the Scandinavian countries, in India and in Latin America, young people of different religions and different political ideas, Christians, Socialists, Liberals, Communists, are uniting under the banner of international friendship.

The Chinese youth who will participate in the Festival and the Congress will feel the sincere friendship from the youth of other countries around them, and they will feel that their struggles and activities are closely cared for by the youth of various countries.

The youth of the world are familiar with and admire your great contribution to the cause of peace, and they know that this contribution has played a very important role, and will play an increasingly important role in the future.

Therefore, your Congress is very important not only for the youth of China but also for the youth of various countries, especially because your Congress is being held on the eve of the Third World Youth Congress and the Fourth World Festival of Youth and Students for Peace and Friendship. In this way, as you have done since the establishment of your Youth League, you have made a great contribution to the struggles and activities led by the World Federation of Democratic Youth.

The World Federation of Democratic Youth celebrates with you the achievements made by the Chinese people under the leadership of Chairman Mao in the construction of the new China, which should also be attributed to the efforts of you young people.

The construction of the new China, the economic, political and social progress of your country, means a happy and joyful life for you young people; for every young Chinese man and woman, it also means that the doors of labor, science, culture and art are wide open.

Young Chinese farmers are cultivating their own land, young workers are creating new wealth for the motherland and improving their lives, the number of students has greatly increased, and they are completely free from economic worries. In all aspects of the struggle, in the patriotic competition, and in cultural work positions, many new young heroes who are familiar and admired by the youth of the world have emerged.

You are at the forefront of national construction, and you have made a great contribution to the victory of peace and the cause of youth.

The World Federation of Democratic Youth wishes you new achievements in completing the great tasks of your first five-year plan, and in all the work that will move your country forward.

The World Federation of Democratic Youth will fight with all its strength alongside the people of the world, and will fight for a ceasefire in Korea and the conclusion of a five-power peace pact.

Advance under the banner of the World Federation of Democratic Youth, in friendship with the youth of the world, and in the struggle for peace and a better future!

Long live the Second National Congress of the All-China Youth Federation!

Long live the friendship of the youth of the world!

Long live peace among the peoples of all countries! (Xinhua News Agency)

### 在中华全国青年第二次代表大会上  世界民主青联书记皮埃罗·皮埃拉利的祝词

    在中华全国青年第二次代表大会上
    世界民主青联书记皮埃罗·皮埃拉利的祝词亲爱的朋友们！
    我代表世界民主青年联盟，代表八十八个国家的七千五百万男女青年向中华全国青年第二次代表大会致敬。
    你们聚集在一起的目的是要总结从第一次代表大会以来的几年中你们所作的斗争和工作。你们的大会将向全中国青年指出怎样在新中国建设事业中更向前迈进，怎样对亚洲及全世界和平事业作更大的贡献。
    和平是世界青年最关心的问题，也是全体人民所深切渴望的。请允许我提醒你们，正在这些天之内，世界和平理事会将举行会议。毫无疑问，它将向全世界人民发出伟大的指示，以便他们在目前国际形势中更坚决地为和平而斗争。
    自从世界人民和平大会以来的时期中，由于每一个国家的人民大众的日益增长的和平意志，对危险的国际局势想设法加以缓和的趋势也在全世界的最广大的阶层中高涨起来了。
    世界人民和青年热烈欢迎世界各大国元首及各该国政府领袖们所发表的声明，这些声明都说：在国际间引起争端的问题没有一个不能以和平方式来解决。
    大家都认为就战俘遣返问题在朝鲜签订的协议是和平的第一个大胜利而为之欢呼，因为这个协议标志着走向朝鲜停战的一个重要阶段，而朝鲜停战是全世界所有的人民和青年所期望的谈判。
    无疑地，这是我们的和平事业可以胜利的初步迹象，而且我们正在以我们青年人的高度的热情贡献给这种事业。
    今天，我们比以往更坚信爱好和平的力量是会胜利的。然而我们知道和平的死敌面对他们的最初的挫折和失败时是不会就此罢休的，如果我们要对维护和平事业作出更大的贡献，从而为所有的青年保证一个幸福和快乐的将来，我们就必须加强动员青年群众，我们就必须更广泛地团结青年来保卫和平。由于全世界人民首先是朝鲜人民和中国人民要求和平的意志而获得了六月八日的协议之后，我们应继续提高警惕，并加强保卫和平的努力。这就是为什么全世界青年将热烈欢迎世界和平理事会的决议并为其实现而在工作中献出他们的一切力量。通过将在今夏召开的第三届世界青年代表大会和第四届世界青年与学生和平与友好联欢节这些伟大的活动，青年们将对和平事业作出很大的贡献。这些活动将标志出世界青年团结的道路上一个新的重要阶段。所有不同国家，不同种族，不同思想的青年们，将兄弟般地在和平意志和友谊中团结起来，要求结束使他们前途莫测的国际紧张局势，要求停止现在使他们遭受生活痛苦的军备竞争。作为走向世界和平的第一步，在筹备上述的大会和联欢节时，青年男女要求结束朝鲜战争，这战争对人民的财产和生命带来了不可补偿的损失。越来越多的青年相信朝鲜战争是可能以和平方式解决的。毫无疑问，在签订六月八日的协议之后，全世界青年将更加强争取和平的斗争，并且，在联欢节和世界青年代表大会这些争取和平的伟大活动的筹备中，青年的团结将大大地加强。不论是参加的人员方面，在表现节日上或举行讨论中，大会和联欢节将比以往更具有不同的新的力量团结一致的集会的性质。
    参加这次大会的将有世界民主青联的会员组织和非会员组织的代表，有与世界民主青联见解并不完全相同的组织的代表，但是他们认为大会的意义在于使不同倾向的青年们之间就青年一代的迫切问题有作忠诚的讨论的机会。
    这联欢节将具有同样广泛的性质的，有表现青年男女的团结的性质，他们在许多问题上有各种不同和分歧的见解，但是他们都同意和平、友谊，尊重青年权利，以及所有国家有进行经济、文化及体育交流的自由。
    世界民主青联为所有愿望和平的青年们组织了以保卫和平与促进友谊，进行讨论，取得联系和互相合作为目的的种种活动。这证明了世界民主青联是忠实遵守它团结全世界青年的宗旨的。
    我们以热烈支持这些原则而感到自豪。这些原则每天都获得新的力量，如各国青年们广泛参加联欢节和世界青年代表大会就证明了这一点。在法国，在意大利，在英国，以及斯堪的那维亚国家，在印度和在拉丁美洲，具有不同宗教信仰、不同政治思想的青年人，基督教徒，社会主义者，自由党人，共产主义者，都在国际友谊的旗帜下团结起来了。
    将要参加联欢节和代表大会的中国青年，将在他们的周围体会到来自其他国家的青年人的真诚的友谊，他们将感觉到他们的斗争和活动是各国青年所亲切关怀的。
    全世界的青年都熟悉并钦佩你们对和平事业的巨大贡献，他们知道这种贡献曾经起了极重要的作用，并且在将来将起越来越重大的作用。
    因此，你们的代表大会，不仅对中国青年而且对于各国青年来说，都是非常重要的，特别是因为你们的代表大会的召开，正好在第三届世界青年代表大会和第四届世界青年与学生和平与友好联欢节的前夕。这样，正如你们的青联成立以来你们所作的那样，你们对世界民主青联所领导的斗争和活动有很大的贡献。
    世界民主青联和你们一道庆贺，中国人民在毛主席领导下在新中国建设中所获得的成就，这种成就也应该归功于你们这些青年的努力。
    新中国的建设，你们国家的经济、政治和社会方面的进步，意味着你们青年人的幸福愉快的生活；对于每个中国青年男女来说，也意味着：劳动、科学、文化艺术的大门是大开着的。
    中国年青农民在自己的土地上耕作，年青的工人们为祖国创造新的财富，改善了生活，学生的数目大大增加，他们完全摆脱了经济上的顾虑，在各方面的斗争中，在爱国主义的竞赛中，在文化工作岗位上，出现了许多为全世界青年所熟悉和敬慕的新青年英雄。
    你们走在国家建设的最前列，你们对和平及青年的事业的胜利有着极大的贡献。
    世界民主青年联盟祝你们在完成你们第一个五年计划的巨大任务中，在使你们国家往前迈进的所有的工作中，获得新的成就。
    世界民主青年联盟将以它的一切力量与全世界人民并肩斗争，并为争取朝鲜停战，缔结五大国和平公约而斗争。
    与全世界青年友好，为和平及更美好的将来的斗争中，在世界民主青年联盟的旗帜下，前进！
    中华全国青年第二次代表大会万岁！
    全世界青年友好万岁！
    各国人民之间的和平万岁！（新华社）
