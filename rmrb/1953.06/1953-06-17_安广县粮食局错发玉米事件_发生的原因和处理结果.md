    An Guang County Grain Bureau's Error in Dispatching Corn:
    Causes and Handling Results
    Letter from the Storage and Transportation Administration Bureau of the Central Grain Ministry: Regarding the case of the An Guang County Grain Bureau in Heilongjiang Province erroneously dispatching three trucks of corn, resulting in losses (the original letter of criticism was published in the "Reader's Letters Summary" column of this newspaper on April 5th and April 24th), we hereby describe the reasons for the erroneous dispatch of corn and the handling process as determined by our investigation:
    On February 8th, the Hebei Provincial Grain Bureau telephoned to report the grain receiving points for March. Yan Guangzu of our bureau took the phone call and, on February 9th, relayed the information by phone to the Northeast Grain Storage and Transportation Company. Among them, one batch of corn's destination was "Botou," but Yang Daoxiu, who answered the phone in the Northeast, misheard "Botou" as "Dezhou." Although it was repeated at the time, neither party noticed the error. The Northeast then included it in the March transportation plan based on the arrival station "Dezhou" and implemented it. When the Central Government's written transportation plan for March was issued on February 26th, the Northeast also failed to detect the error upon comparison. On February 27th, the Northeast submitted the March transportation plan, and Li Mingxin, the person in charge in our bureau, also failed to promptly review and identify the error of writing "Botou" as "Dezhou" in the plan. Thus, this accident occurred. On March 19th, the Northeast telephoned to report the occurrence of this accident. In order to promptly handle the three trucks of corn that had been mistakenly sent to Dezhou and avoid the expansion of losses due to no one receiving them, we immediately notified the Shandong Provincial Grain Bureau by phone on March 22nd to instruct the Dezhou Grain Bureau to receive and handle them locally, while also notifying the Northeast to investigate the cause of the error and report it to the Ministry. Some staff members of our bureau and the Northeast Grain Storage and Transportation Company were careless and irresponsible in their work, resulting in this unnecessary loss. In addition to criticizing and educating the parties involved, we are determined to strive for improvement in our future work.

    安广县粮食局错发玉米事件
    发生的原因和处理结果
    中央粮食部储运管理局来信：关于黑龙江省安广县粮食局错发玉米三车造成损失案（原批评信刊四月五日及四月二十四日本报“读者来信摘要”栏），兹将我们检查出的错发玉米的原因及处理经过叙述如下：
    二月八日河北省粮食厅电话报告三月份接粮点，我局阎光祖接话记录后，于二月九日用电话逐笔转告东北粮谷储运公司。其中有一批玉米到达点为“泊头”，而东北接话的杨道修将“泊头”误听为“德州”，当时虽经覆诵但双方都未发觉。东北即根据到达站“德州”做入三月份运输计划下达执行。及至二月二十六日中央三月份书面运输计划下达，东北也未对照发觉错误；二月二十七日，东北上报三月份运输计划，我局经办人李铭心也没有及时将计划内把“泊头”写为“德州”的错误核审出来。这样，就造成了此项事故。三月十九日，东北电话反映发生此项事故，我们为了把已错发到德州的三车玉米及时处理，以免无人接收扩大损失，当于三月二十二日电话通知山东省粮食厅转知德州粮食局就地接收处理，一面通知东北查明错发原因报部。我局及东北粮谷储运公司某些工作人员工作粗枝大叶，不负责任，以致造成这种不应有的损失。我们除对当事人进行批评教育外，并决心在今后工作中力求改进。
