    Xinhua News Agency, Helsinki, 5th (TASS dispatch): The "Finnish Peace Advocates" organization has sent a letter to Finnish Prime Minister Kekkonen, asking him to pay attention to the proposal of the International Committee of the World Peace Congress to support the five major powers in holding negotiations to conclude a peace pact. The letter pointed out that many countries have responded to the committee's letter. The foreign ministers of the Nordic countries also advocated holding negotiations among the five major powers. The letter emphasized that this shows how important people believe holding five-power negotiations is for easing international tensions. The letter from the Finnish Peace Advocates pointed out that the Finnish people have also expressed their views on this issue. Approximately 850,000 Finnish citizens signed a declaration calling for the conclusion of a five-power peace pact. The peace advocates requested the Finnish government to support measures taken to consolidate world peace and to give a positive reply to the letter from the International Committee of the World Peace Congress.
