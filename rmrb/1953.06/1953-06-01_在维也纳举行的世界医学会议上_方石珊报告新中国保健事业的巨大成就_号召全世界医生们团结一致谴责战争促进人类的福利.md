Xinhua News Agency, Prague, May 31st: At the World Medical Conference held in Vienna from the 23rd to the 25th of this month, Fang Shishan, head of the Chinese delegation, made a report on the impact of war on people's health. Fang Shishan's report was warmly welcomed by the participants.

In his report, Fang Shishan contrasted the suffering of the Chinese people during the period of Japanese military aggression and the dark rule of the Kuomintang with the amazing achievements of the Chinese people in health work after liberation. He painted a vivid picture illustrating that war means disease and death, while peace means health and happiness.

He said: New China is focusing its efforts on preventing the spread of certain malignant infectious diseases. As a result of large-scale vaccination, smallpox has now completely disappeared in major cities and seaports. In some parts of China, there used to be periodic epidemics, which have now been completely prevented. The number of people suffering from the chronic disease of tuberculosis has also been significantly reduced.

Dr. Fang Shishan used statistics to show that the mortality rate of mothers and infants in China has been greatly reduced since liberation. He also talked about the effective measures taken in the cities and villages of New China to protect the health of mothers and children, the protection of workers' health, safe working conditions, and special attention to the health work of ethnic minorities.

He continued: As the national health plan continues to expand, the government is working hard to train more doctors. The number of new medical students enrolled in the three years from 1950 to 1952 was 20% more than the total number of doctors who graduated in the 69 years before liberation.

Fang Shishan also described the effects of the historic patriotic health campaign launched in 1952, which has significantly improved environmental hygiene and generally reduced the number of illnesses. He went on to say: The only reason for the fundamental change in China's health situation is that the government is acting in accordance with the wishes of the people. However, without peace, all these achievements would be impossible.

He finally called on doctors to stand up for humanity. He said: "We must insist that all medical achievements should only be used to promote human welfare. We must condemn the act of using medical science as a tool for killing human beings. We must condemn war. This is a solemn responsibility that all medical workers must fulfill. The unity of all peace-loving doctors in the world will contribute to the realization of world peace."

    在维也纳举行的世界医学会议上
    方石珊报告新中国保健事业的巨大成就
    号召全世界医生们团结一致谴责战争促进人类的福利
    【新华社布拉格三十一日电】在本月二十三日到二十五日举行的维也纳世界医学会议上，我国代表团团长方石珊作了关于战争对人民健康影响的报告。方石珊的报告受到与会者热烈的欢迎。
    方石珊在他的报告中对比了中国人民在日本军事侵略时期和国民党的黑暗统治时期所遭遇到的痛苦和解放后中国人民在卫生工作上的惊人成就。他描绘了一幅生动的图画，说明了战争意味着疾病与死亡，而和平意味着健康与幸福。
    他说：新中国集中力量来防止某些恶性传染病的流行。由于大规模种牛痘的结果，今天天花症已在大城市与海港完全绝迹。在中国有些地方以前曾有过周期性的疫症流行，现在已完全加以防止了。患肺结核病这种慢性病的人数也已显著地减少了。
    方石珊医生用统计数字表明中国在解放后母亲与婴儿的死亡率已大大地降低，他并谈到在新中国的城市与乡村已采取了保护母亲与儿童的健康的有效措施，谈到工人健康的保障，谈到安全的工作条件，谈到特别注意少数民族的卫生工作这种种情况。
    他继续说：随着全中国卫生计划的不断扩大，政府正在努力训练更多的医生。从一九五○年到一九五二年这三年中，新入学的医科学生人数，要比解放前六十九年中毕业出来的医生总人数还多百分之二十。
    方石珊又叙述了在一九五二年发起的历史性的爱国卫生运动的效果，这个运动已使环境卫生显著改善和患病人数普遍减少。他接着说：中国健康情况有了根本改变的唯一原因，是政府按照人民的希望办事。但是，如果没有和平的话，所有这些成就是不可能的。
    他最后号召医生们起来维护人道。他说：“我们必须坚持，医学上的一切成就只应该用来促进人类的福利。我们必须谴责把医药科学当作屠杀人类的工具的行动。我们必须谴责战争。这是所有医学工作者所必须履行的庄严责任。世界各国一切爱好和平的医生的团结一致，将对世界和平的实现有所贡献。”
