Central Geological Department's Team 429
Widely Promotes Advanced Experience in Steel Grit Drilling
Central Geological Department's Team 429, learning from the Soviet Union's advanced drilling experience, universally implemented the steel grit drilling method. The average drilling footage increased from 0.8-0.9 meters to 1.5 meters; the average core sampling rate increased by about 25 percent; and the cost of drilling footage also decreased. In the past, expensive diamond drill bits were used, but now they have been completely replaced by steel grit.

After Team 429 launched large-scale drilling operations, they encountered a new problem. If the 31 drilling rigs (22 Soviet-style drilling rigs, 6 Japanese-style Tone drilling rigs, 2 American-style Longyear Pioneer drilling rigs, and 1 hand-cranked rig) continued to use the old methods and used diamond and corundum drill bits, the cost would be too high, and sometimes a shortage of goods would lead to drilling shutdowns. If alloy bits were used, they often could not cope with hard rock formations, and the footage and core extraction rate were very low. After May 1952, with the development of various aspects of Team 429's work and in response to the needs of national industrial construction, the Tieshan area needed to calculate the iron ore reserves within a certain period. Based on one hundred drilling workers and trainees transferred from the Northeast, Team 429 began to promote the steel grit drilling method in the Tieshan area. Now, the entire team has universally applied the advanced experience of steel grit drilling.

The promotion of steel grit drilling by Team 429 was a victory achieved through struggle against various conservative ideas. Those using non-Soviet-style drilling rigs had the greatest conservative ideas. The drillers using Tone drilling rigs were mostly experienced technical workers who had always used alloy and diamond drill bits. Although they understood something about steel grit drilling, they were limited to the old methods, believing that grit had to be fed into the hole using a sand feeder, one grain at a time. If this rule was not followed, accidents would occur. Seeing the Northeast drillers using a large amount of steel grit, they thought it was too risky. However, the plans set for the drilling rigs used by the Northeast drillers were always higher than theirs, and the leading cadres also asked them to improve their plans. Under these circumstances, some drillers began to experiment with steel grit drilling. Rig No. 17 was a Tone-style drilling rig, and the rig leader, Li Chengfu, was an experienced old driller who had always drilled according to Japanese methods, putting in only a few grains of steel grit each time. When the leading cadres called for the adoption of steel grit drilling, he lacked confidence. He used his hand to grab a handful, adding a little at a time, gradually increasing it to two kilograms. Because the steel grit was added sparingly, the drill string was clamped, causing an accident. Later, he added sixteen kilograms of steel grit at a time, and the efficiency increased rapidly, with the footage per shift increasing from 0.8 meters to 1.5 meters. The workers using the American Longyear Pioneer drilling rigs were very envious of the high efficiency of the Soviet drilling rigs and wanted to switch to Soviet drilling rigs. They believed that it was impossible to promote the steel grit drilling method on the Pioneer drilling rigs. When the Tone drilling rigs succeeded in using steel grit drilling, the workers using Pioneer-style drilling rigs still did not believe it, thinking that the Tone drilling rigs were manually operated and pressurized, allowing for free adjustment and easy delivery of steel grit to the bottom of the hole, making drilling convenient. The Pioneer-style drilling rigs, on the other hand, had fixed pressure and could not be operated freely, so they dared not use steel grit drilling. The leading cadres repeatedly explained to them: "If an accident occurs during the experiment with steel grit drilling, the leadership will be responsible." Only then did the workers using Pioneer-style drilling rigs begin to experiment boldly. Rig No. 8 achieved victory in one experiment. After adding steel grit, they no longer increased the pressure, but adjusted the water volume with a water pump to control the drilling, then listened to the sound in the hole and estimated when the steel grit was about to run out before continuing to add grit. They also switched to Soviet-specification drill bits to suit the needs of deeper drilling holes. In this way, the progress of Rig No. 8 was faster than with diamond drill bits, and drilling in the iron ore layer created a record of more than 12 meters per day, completely changing the previous backward phenomenon of not being able to extract core samples and only being able to drill 0.01 meters per shift. The drillers of the entire rig greatly increased their confidence and no longer said that grit drilling was not suitable for spiral-pressurized Pioneer drilling rigs. Instead, they felt that using steel grit was less laborious than using diamonds.

The drillers from the Northeast, although they had accepted the advanced Soviet experience earlier in the Northeast drilling projects, did not have much practical experience, and not everyone had mastered the Soviet steel grit drilling technology. During the promotion of grit drilling, they gradually mastered the laws of changes inside the hole, pressure, and water volume, their confidence increased, and the promotion of steel grit drilling was universally implemented on Soviet-style drilling rigs.

Team 429 still needs to strengthen the leadership of learning advanced drilling experience. Currently, drilling workers have very little time to study drilling theory, and the overall leadership of studying drilling theory has not been established and improved. Many drilling workers study and do it themselves. Advanced drilling experience has not been widely exchanged, and the promotion work of some drilling rigs is poor, so that the single-shot grit drilling method has not been promoted, and most drilling rigs still use the multiple (three or four times) replenishment method for drilling, which affects the drilling speed.

    中央地质部四二九队
    普遍推广钢砂钻进先进经验
    中央地质部四二九队学习苏联先进钻探经验，普遍实行钢砂钻进法。钻探进尺平均由零点八、九公尺提高到一公尺五；采取岩心率平均增加了百分之二十五左右；钻探进尺的成本也随着降低，过去采用高价的金钢石钻头，现已完全用钢砂代替。
    四二九队开展大规模的钻探工作以后，遇到了一个新的问题。三十一部钻机（二十二部苏联式钻机，六部日式利根钻机，两部美式长年先锋钻机，一部手摇机）如果沿用旧的方法，使用金钢石、金钢砂钻头，成本太高，有时货缺，就有停钻危险；用合金片钻头，又往往不能对付硬的岩层，进尺和提取岩心率都很低。一九五二年五月以后，随着四二九队各方面工作的开展，适应着国家工业建设的需要，铁山区要在一定的时期内计算出铁矿埋藏量来。四二九队以东北调来的一百名钻工和学员为基础，从铁山区开始推广钢砂钻进法，现在，全队已普遍运用钢砂钻进的先进经验。
    四二九队推广投砂钻进，是和各种保守思想进行斗争而获得胜利的。使用非苏联式的钻机的人，保守思想最大。使用利根钻机的钻工，多半是有钻探经验的技术工人，一向用合金片和金钢石钻头，对投砂钻进，虽然也了解一些，但局限于旧的办法，认为投砂必经投砂器一粒粒地摇下去，如不遵守这个规则，就要出事故。看到东北钻工使用大量投砂法，以为太冒险。但是，东北钻工使用的钻机每次订的计划都比他们高，领导干部也要求他们提高计划。在这样情况下，有些钻工就开始试验投砂钻进。十七号钻机是利根式的钻机，机长李成辅是一个老钻工，过去都是按照日本的办法钻探，每次放钢砂只放几粒。当领导干部号召采用钢砂钻进时，他信心不足。一次用手抓一把，一次放一点，一直增到两公斤。因为钢砂放得少，反而把钻柱夹住出了事故。以后一次投到十六公斤钢砂，效率飞快提高，每班进尺由零点八增到一公尺五。使用美国长年先锋钻机的工人，看到苏联钻机效率高，非常羡慕，也想换苏联钻机。他们认为在先锋钻机上推广钢砂钻进法是不可能的。当利根钻机使用钢砂钻进成功时，使用先锋式的钻机工人还不相信，以为利根钻机是人力操纵加压，可以自由调整，容易使钢砂送到孔底，钻进方便；而先锋式的钻机是固定加压，不能操纵自如，还不敢使用钢砂钻进。领导干部一再向他们说明：“试验钢砂钻进而出了事故，领导负责。”使用先锋式的钻机的工人，才开始大胆试验。八号钻机一试验就取得胜利。在投钢砂以后，就不再增加压力，而用水泵调整水量以掌握钻进，然后听孔内的声音，估计钢砂将尽时，再继续投砂；又改用苏联规格钻头，以适合于较深钻孔的需要。这样，八号钻机进度比金钢钻头进度还快，在铁矿层中钻进，创日进十二公尺以上的纪录，完全改变了过去取不出岩心和每班只能进尺零点零一公尺的落后现象。全机钻工信心大增，再不说投砂钻进不适用于螺旋加压的先锋钻了，反而感到使用钢砂比金钢石还省力。
    来自东北的钻工，在东北钻探工程中，虽然接受苏联先进经验较早，但是，实际经验并不多，也不是每个人都已掌握了苏联钢砂钻进的技术。他们在推广投砂钻进时期中，逐渐掌握了孔内变化、加压和水量大小的规律，信心提高了，推广钢砂钻进也在苏联式钻机上普遍实行起来。
    四二九队对学习先进钻探经验的领导还须加强。现在，钻探工人学习钻探理论的时间非常少，学习钻探理论的总的领导也没有建立和健全起来。许多钻探工人自己学，自己做。先进钻探经验没有得到广泛的交流，有些钻机推广工作较差，以致一次投砂钻进法没有推广起来，多数钻机还用多次（三、四次）补给法钻进，影响钻进速度。（庞大镛、洛君）
