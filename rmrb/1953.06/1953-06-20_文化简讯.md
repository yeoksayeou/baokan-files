Cultural Briefs

    A large number of ancient cultural relics have been successively excavated in the suburbs of Zhengzhou and Luoyang.
    In the suburbs of Zhengzhou, Luoyang, Xinyang and other cities in Henan Province, a large number of ancient cultural relics have been excavated recently. Since the beginning of spring this year, various pottery fragments, bone cones, stone sickles, stone axes, "swallow-tailed" bronze arrowheads, and divination bones with traces of burning and chiseling have been successively discovered in Erligang, Fenghuangtai, Zijing Mountain, Penggong Temple, Xiaochenzhuang and other places in the suburbs of Zhengzhou, proving that this place may be a large residential site from the Yin and Shang Dynasties. It is particularly worth noting that in April this year, a bone fragment with characters carved on animal ribs was unearthed in Erligang. After being sent to the Chinese Academy of Sciences for identification, it was determined to be a "practice character bone" (bone fragment for practicing carving characters) from the Yin and Shang Dynasties. In the past, oracle bone inscriptions were only discovered in Xiaotun (Yinxu) near Anyang. If more discoveries can be made near Zhengzhou now, there will be more reliable evidence for China's credible history. In the suburbs of Luoyang, many ancient tombs from the Warring States period to the Han Dynasty have been discovered; in a certain construction area alone, there are 572 ancient tombs. From the tombs, a variety of rice, grain, hemp, and millet stored in tile granaries were excavated, as well as about 200 boxes of various copper and pottery funerary objects. In March this year, when clearing an ancient cultural site in coordination with basic construction in the suburbs of Xinyang Town, Neolithic relics were discovered, such as cord-patterned pottery li, pottery ding, stone arrowheads, stone spears, pottery spinning wheels, and pottery net sinkers, as well as standard black pottery and painted pottery relics; in addition, more than 200 pieces of finely patterned jade bi and other items were also excavated.
    The Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government, the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and the cultural departments of Henan Province attach great importance to the above discoveries. Archaeological experts Pei Wenzhong and Xia Nai have gone to Zhengzhou and Luoyang to lead the excavation work; the Cultural Affairs Bureau of the People's Government of Henan Province has also sent cultural relics work teams to be stationed in Zhengzhou, Luoyang and other places on a regular basis.

    郑州、洛阳市郊陆续发掘出大批古代文物
    河南省郑州、洛阳、信阳等市郊区，近来发掘出大批古代文物。今年入春以来，在郑州市郊二里岗、凤凰台、紫荆山、彭公祠、小陈庄等地，陆续发现殷商时代的各种陶片、骨锥、石镰、石斧、“燕尾式”铜箭簇和有灼、凿痕迹的卜骨等物，证明该处可能是一个殷商时代的广大居民遗址。特别值得注意的是：今年四月间在二里岗发掘出有刻在动物肋骨上的有字骨片一件，经送中国科学院鉴定为殷商时代的“习刻字骨”（练习刻字的骨片）。按我国过去只有安阳小屯（殷墟）一带发现有甲骨文字，现在在郑州附近如果能有更多的发现，对于中国的信史将会有更多可靠的证据。在洛阳市郊区，发现很多从战国到汉代的古墓葬；仅在某一建校区就有古墓五百七十二个。从墓葬中发掘出有盛在瓦仓里面的稻、谷、麻、稷等多种，还有各种铜类、陶类殉葬器物约二百箱。今年三月间，在信阳镇郊区配合基本建设清理一处古代文化遗址时，发现了新石器时代的遗物，如绳纹陶鬲陶鼎、石箭簇、石矛、陶纺轮、陶网坠，并有标准黑陶和彩陶等遗物；此外还挖掘出有花纹工细的玉璧等共二百多件。
    中央人民政府文化部、中国科学院和河南省的文化部门，对以上发现都非常重视。考古学专家裴文中、夏鼐等都曾往郑州和洛阳领导发掘工作；河南省人民政府文化事业管理局也派有文物工作组经常驻在郑州、洛阳等地。
