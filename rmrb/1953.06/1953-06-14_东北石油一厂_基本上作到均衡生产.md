Northeast Petroleum Plant No. 1
Basically Achieves Balanced Production

Northeast Petroleum Plant No. 1 mobilized its workers to launch a "Daily Progress Plan Competition," reversing the previously erratic production situation.

Although Petroleum Plant No. 1 completed the state production plan in the first quarter of this year, it did not complete the plan in a balanced manner. In January, several major products failed to meet the plan, and it was only through a crash effort in March that they were made up. To change this situation, Petroleum Plant No. 1 launched a competition to complete the daily progress plan starting in May. According to statistics from the first and middle ten days of May, after the competition was launched, six of the ten major products completed their plans on a ten-day basis, and three completed their plans on a daily basis.

The method used by Petroleum Plant No. 1 to carry out the "Daily Progress Plan Competition" was to have the planning section propose monthly, ten-day, and daily production targets to the workshops. Each workshop, based on its specific circumstances, mobilized the masses to discuss and formulate "Daily Progress Plan Competition Charts," daily plan charts for teams, and individual guarantee conditions. The progress of the competition is summarized by the entire plant once a month and by the workshops once every ten days. The workshop summaries are conducted by the workshop trade unions. If the entire workshop completes the plan on a daily and ten-day basis and achieves the guarantee conditions in terms of quality, safety, etc., it can receive the plant's flowing red banner—the "Full House Red" banner. The competition between teams and individuals is summarized once a day under the leadership of the workshop trade union. If they can complete all daily progress plans and guarantee conditions, they can receive the workshop's flowing small red banner—the "Daily Red" banner.

There are three benefits to carrying out the "Daily Progress Plan Competition": (1) Practical production plans are formulated at each level, with daily plans and individual plans, so that cadres and workers have clear goals and are well-informed. (2) Because the "Daily Progress Plan Competition" is carried out between departments and teams that manufacture the same products or semi-finished products, the workers in the three day-and-night shifts have consistent goals, can exchange advanced experience with each other, and help each other improve output and quality and reduce the consumption quotas of various materials.
(3) Because there are daily progress charts as a sign, it can be seen on the same day which units have failed to complete the plan, which facilitates the timely discovery and resolution of problems existing in production. (Xinhua News Agency)

### 东北石油一厂  基本上作到均衡生产

    东北石油一厂
    基本上作到均衡生产
    东北石油一厂发动职工开展“日进度计划竞赛”，扭转了过去生产时松时紧的不正常现象。
    石油一厂在今年第一季度虽然完成了国家生产计划，但没有均衡地完成计划，一月份有好几种主要产品没完成计划，到三月份经过突击才补上。为了改变这种情况，石油一厂从五月份起展开了完成日进度计划的竞赛。这个竞赛开展以后，据五月上、中旬的统计，十种主要产品有六种按旬完成了计划，有三种按日完成了计划。
    石油一厂开展“日进度计划竞赛”的办法，是先由计划科提出月、旬、日生产计划指标交给车间，各车间根据本单位的具体情况发动群众加以讨论，订出“日进度计划竞赛图表”、班组的日计划图表和个人的保证条件。竞赛进行的情况，全厂每月总结一次，车间每旬总结一次。车间的总结由车间工会进行，如果全车间都按日、按旬完成计划并实现了质量、安全等方面的保证条件，就可以得到全厂的流动红旗——“满堂红”红旗。班组和个人的竞赛，在车间工会领导下一天总结一次，如能完成各项日进度计划和保证条件，就可得到全车间的流动小红旗——“天天红”红旗。
    开展“日进度计划竞赛”的好处有三点：（一）层层订出切实可行的生产计划，天天有计划，人人有计划，使干部和工人目标明确，心中有数。（二）由于“日进度计划竞赛”是在制造同样产品或半成品的部与部、班与班之间展开竞赛，就使得日夜三班的工人目标一致，能够互相交流先进经验，互相帮助提高产量、质量和降低各项材料消耗定额。
    （三）因有日进度图表做标志，哪个单位完不成计划当天就可以看出来，便于及时发现和解决生产中存在的问题。（新华社）
