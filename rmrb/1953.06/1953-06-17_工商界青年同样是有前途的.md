Youth in Industry and Commerce Also Have a Promising Future
Representative to the Second National Congress of the Chinese Communist Youth League
Deputy Manager of Guangzhou Huaxing Trading Company, Zhang Shiqian

    The Second National Congress of the Chinese Communist Youth League has opened. As a youth from the industrial and commercial sector, I am representing the youth of Guangzhou's industrial and commercial sector to attend this grand meeting, which marks the great unity of the nation's youth under the banner of Mao Zedong. I have come with boundless excitement, an emotion that defies description.

    My ability to participate in this grand meeting demonstrates the importance that the country and the people place on us, the youth in industry and commerce. This is an honor for us. I sincerely thank Chairman Mao, the Chinese Communist Party, and the People's Government for their care!

    In the old society, youth in industry and commerce were often listless, having lost the enthusiasm, vitality, and courage characteristic of youth. It was only due to the victory of the people's revolution that we were reminded that we are still young, and that we regained our youthful vigor and due vitality. I deeply feel the happiness of the generation of youth living in the Mao Zedong era.

    Youth in industry and commerce, including myself, recognized the ugly side of the national bourgeoisie through the great "Five-Anti" movement. However, because we did not have a sufficient understanding of the historical tasks of the national bourgeoisie in the current national construction, we also had the idea of "throwing off the burden," feeling uneasy in our positions, looking for opportunities to transfer to other jobs, and unable to muster the energy for active management. In the early period after the end of the "Five-Anti" movement, I also had this idea. Although I did not give up management at the time, I planned to continue my studies and prepare to become a cadre working for the People's Government. Therefore, I held the idea of "doing the job perfunctorily." Later, at the Central South China Materials Exchange Conference, I saw the leadership and support of the state-owned economy for us, and the care and importance that the local government leaders placed on us. I initially recognized the importance of connecting material exchanges and enlivening the urban and rural economy, thereby restoring my confidence and enthusiasm for management. In the past year, thanks to the government's support, the efforts of the shop employees, and my own active management, my business, like many of our peers, has developed and obtained a certain profit. We believe that as long as we actively manage industries and businesses that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood, they all have a promising future.

    Although our business has developed and we have made profits, we have not felt particularly excited or happy. This is because we do not have a sufficient understanding of the status and tasks of our national industrialists and businesspeople. After participating in this conference, we youth in industry and commerce more clearly recognized that as one of the five economic components of the New Democracy, private industry and commerce occupy a certain position and play a certain role in today's national construction. It is also one of the forces for realizing national industrialization, and it makes the same contribution to the country and the people. It is needed and indispensable to the motherland.

    Through repeated education by the People's Government and our own continuous learning, I have learned and realized from many specific examples that our past idea of "throwing off the burden" was wrong. This erroneous idea made us lack interest in our work, hindered the development of our management enthusiasm, directly affected the development of our own enterprises, and indirectly affected the completion of the tasks assigned to us by the state, failing the earnest expectations of the country and the people.

    Now, our great motherland has entered a new historical period, and large-scale economic construction has begun. This is a great, glorious, and arduous task, the completion of which will bring us unprecedented beautiful and happy lives. We industrialists and businesspeople are a component of the people. As long as we actively participate in this great work, we will make a certain contribution to national construction, and the people will never forget us.

    The people of the whole country have already stood at their respective positions, enthusiastically and actively throwing themselves into this great construction upsurge, and working and struggling selflessly to complete this new historical task. The youth have demonstrated the excellent qualities of youth and become an important force in building the motherland. Are we, the youth in industry and commerce, willing to lag behind? No, we must not lag behind! We must fulfill our due responsibilities. In the future, we should study a hundredfold more diligently, work actively, respond to the call of this conference, and take on the tasks assigned to us by the motherland.

    We must strive to transform ourselves, overcome the decadent and backward aspects, and give play to the active and progressive aspects. Under the leadership of the working class and the state-owned economy, following the track of the Common Program, we must actively manage our businesses, strive to develop production and enliven the urban and rural economy! Furthermore, we must play a leading role in our industrial and commercial circles, promoting the common progress and advancement of the entire industrial and commercial sector.

    Under the glorious and victorious banner of Mao Zedong, let us work together with the people of the whole country to build our happy, prosperous, great, rich, and strong motherland!

    工商界青年同样是有前途的
    中华全国青年第二次代表大会代表
    广州华兴贸易行副经理  张仕骞
    中华全国青年第二次代表大会开幕了。我是一个工商界青年，这次代表广州市工商界青年，参加这次隆重的、标志着在毛泽东旗帜下全国青年大团结的盛会。我带着无限兴奋的心情而来，这种激动的情绪是无法形容的。
    我能够参加这次盛会，说明了国家和人民对我们工商界青年的重视。这是我们工商界青年的光荣。我衷心地感谢毛主席、中国共产党和人民政府给予我们的关怀！
    工商界青年在旧社会里，常常是暮气沉沉，失去了青年人的热情、活泼、勇敢的特性。由于人民革命的胜利，才使我们记起我们还是青年，恢复了青年的活力和应有的蓬勃的朝气。我深深地感到生活在毛泽东时代的青年一代的幸福。
    工商界青年，连我自己在内，通过伟大的“五反”运动认识了民族资产阶级丑恶的一面。但是，由于我们对于民族资产阶级在目前祖国建设中所负的历史任务认识不足，也存在着“丢包袱”的思想，不安于位，找寻机会，转移工作，提不起积极经营的劲头。当“五反”结束初期，我同样存在着这种思想，虽然我当时没有放弃经营，但我计划着继续求学，准备当人民政府的工作干部。因此，我抱着“做一日和尚，撞一日钟”的思想。后来，在中南区物资交流大会上，我看到了国营经济对我们的领导和扶植，地方政府首长对我们的关怀和重视，初步认识到沟通物资交流、活跃城乡经济的重要性，从而恢复了我的经营信心和积极性。一年来，由于政府的扶植，店员工友的努力和本身的积极经营，我的企业和我们许多同业一样，有了发展，并得到了一定的利润。我们相信：只要积极经营，对国计民生有利的工商业，都有发展前途。
    我们的企业虽然有了发展，也获得了利润，然而我们还没有觉得十分兴奋和痛快。因为我们对于我们民族工商业者的地位和任务，没有足够的认识。参加了这次大会，我们工商界青年更加清楚地认识到作为新民主主义五种经济成分之一的私营工商业，在今天的祖国建设中，占有一定位置，起着一定作用。它也是实现国家工业化的力量之一，对国家人民是同样有贡献的，都是祖国需要的、不可缺少的。
    通过人民政府的反复教育、自己的不断学习，我从许多具体事例中体会、认识到过去我们“丢包袱”的思想是错误的。这种错误思想使我们对自己的工作缺乏兴趣，阻碍了我们经营积极性的发挥，直接影响了自己企业的发展，间接影响了国家分配给我们的任务的完成，有负于国家人民的殷切期望。
    现在，我们伟大的祖国进入了一个新的历史时期，大规模的经济建设已经开始。这是一个伟大光荣、艰巨的任务，它的完成，将带给我们从未有过的美丽的幸福的生活。我们工商业者是人民的一个组成部分，只要我们积极参与这伟大的工作，对国家建设就有了一定的贡献，人民也决不会忘掉我们。
    全国人民都已站在各个不同的岗位上，热烈地、积极地投入这伟大的建设高潮，为完成这新的历史任务而忘我地工作着、奋斗着。青年们更发挥了青年人的优良品质，成为建设祖国的重要力量。我们工商界青年，自甘落后吗？不，我们决不能落后！我们要尽我们应尽的责任。今后我们应该千百倍地努力学习，积极工作，响应此次大会的号召，负起祖国交给我们的任务。
    我们要努力改造自己，克服腐朽、落后的一面，发挥积极、进步的一面，在工人阶级和国营经济领导下，遵循着共同纲领的轨道，积极经营，为发展生产、活跃城乡经济而努力！并且我们要在我们工商界中，起带头骨干作用，推动整个工商界共同进步，共同前进。
    让我们在光辉的、胜利的毛泽东旗帜下，和全国人民一道为建设我们幸福、繁荣、伟大、富强的祖国而奋斗吧！
