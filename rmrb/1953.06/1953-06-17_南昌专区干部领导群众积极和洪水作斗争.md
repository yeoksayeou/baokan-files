Cadres in Nanchang Prefecture Lead the Masses to Actively Fight the Flood

The cadres at all levels in Nanchang Prefecture, Jiangxi Province, led the masses in a resolute struggle against the flood.

On May 26th, a flash flood broke out, and thirteen counties in Nanchang Prefecture, including Pingxiang, Xinyu, Qingjiang, Yichun, Fenyi, and Wanzai, suffered varying degrees of flooding, with Pingxiang, Xinyu, and Qingjiang counties being the most severely affected. In Pingxiang County, over 123,200 mu of farmland were flooded, over 800 houses were destroyed, and 1,447 small-scale water conservancy projects were washed away.

After the flood occurred, the Nanchang Prefectural Committee, the Prefectural Administrative Office, and the leading organs of various counties took emergency measures, mobilized all possible forces, and led the farmers in the disaster areas to fight the flood. All responsible cadres of the Prefectural Committee, the Prefectural Administrative Office, and the county committees and county governments went deep into the disaster areas to lead the masses in disaster relief.

After the heavy rain and flash flood, each county immediately established flood control command organizations (non-key flood control counties originally had no flood control organizations), with the county head and the county party secretary serving as commander and political commissar respectively, leading all farmers to rescue. In Pingxiang County alone, the transportation workers rescued more than 3,000 packages and more than 50,000 jin of grain, and the militia and residents of Xiangdong Street rescued more than 100 people from Yantian and Hezhou townships.

When the flood receded and after it receded, they vigorously mobilized and organized the masses to rescue the flooded rice fields, actively draining water, removing sand, supporting and washing seedlings, applying top dressing, weeding, and transplanting late rice; and quickly repaired the washed-out water conservancy projects. In Yantian and Hezhou townships, Xiangdong District, Pingxiang County, more than 1,000 people were mobilized on the 27th to wash seedlings; after the Chitu Dike in Sanhou Township, Maxia District, was washed away, Gan Yuancai, chairman of the Farmers' Association, and Lin Renqi, a county labor model, mobilized more than 300 people to repair it, completing it all in just two and a half days and restoring irrigation.

All disaster areas carried out condolences and emergency relief to the disaster victims. The Nanchang Prefectural Committee, the Prefectural Administrative Office, and the Provincial Committee and Provincial Government jointly organized a condolence group, led by Zhu Kaiquan, director of the Provincial Department of Civil Affairs, and others, divided into seven groups, carrying more than 400 million yuan in relief funds, to Pingxiang, Xinyu and other severely affected areas to express condolences and relief to the disaster victims. Pingxiang, Xinyu and other counties also organized condolence groups or condolence brigades, led by the county party secretary and county head, to go to the disaster areas.

The masses in various places also demonstrated the spirit of unity and mutual assistance, carried out mutual assistance and mutual relief, and helped the disaster-stricken farmers to help themselves through production and overcome difficulties. For example, Yang Chensheng, a farmer in Qingyun Township, Pingxiang County, had more than three mu of land completely covered by silt, and his mood was very bad. The Xiao Mingnian mutual aid group, seeing his situation, on the one hand, persuaded him not to be pessimistic, and on the other hand, helped him to remove the silt from the fields. Encouraged by the friendly behavior of the Xiao Mingnian mutual aid group, he also removed the silt day and night to prepare for replanting. In areas that were not affected by the disaster, many farmers donated money to help the disaster victims; after receiving assistance, the disaster-stricken masses are working hard to carry out production.

At present, the floods in Nanchang, Xinjian and other places have not completely receded, and the post-disaster work in the disaster areas of Pingxiang, Xinyu and other counties has not been properly handled; all counties must continue to vigorously carry out rescue and production for disaster relief and strive for a bumper harvest.

    南昌专区干部领导群众积极和洪水作斗争
    江西省南昌专区各级干部领导群众和洪水作了坚决的斗争。
    五月二十六日山洪暴发，南昌专区萍乡、新喻、清江、宜春、分宜、万载等十三个县遭受了轻重不同的水灾，以萍乡、新喻、清江等三县最为严重。萍乡县被淹田达十二万三千二百多亩，冲坏房屋八百多间，冲毁小型水利工程一千四百四十七座。
    水灾发生后，南昌地委、专署和各县领导机关采取了紧急措施，动员了一切可以动员的力量，领导灾区农民与水灾作斗争。地委、专署以及各县县委、县府的全体负责干部都深入到灾区，领导群众救灾。
    在大雨骤降山洪暴发后，各县立即成立了防洪指挥机构（非防洪重点县原无防洪机构），由县长、县委书记分任指挥和政委，领导全体农民抢救。只是萍乡县搬运工人就抢救出粮食三千多包又五万多斤，湘东街民兵、居民抢救出砚田、河洲两个乡一百多人。
    在洪水退落时和退落后，他们大力发动、组织群众抢救被水淹的稻田，积极排水、除沙、扶洗禾苗、追肥、耘禾、插晚禾；迅速修补被冲垮的水利工程。萍乡县湘东区砚田、河洲两乡在二十七日动员了群众一千多人洗禾；麻山区三候乡赤土陂冲坏后，农会主席甘远才及县劳动模范林仁其发动了三百多人修补，只二天半的时间就全部完成，恢复了灌溉。
    灾区各地都对灾民进行了慰问和紧急救济。南昌地委、专署和省委、省府共同组织慰问团，由省民政厅长朱开铨等率领，分七个小组，携带救济款四亿多元，分赴萍乡、新喻等重灾区慰问和救济灾民。萍乡、新喻等县也组织了慰问团或慰问大队，由县委书记、县长率领到灾区去。
    各地群众也发挥了团结友爱的精神，进行了互助互济，帮助受灾农民生产自救，克服困难。如萍乡县青云乡农民杨晨生三亩多田全被淤沙掩盖，情绪很坏。萧明年互助组看到他这种情形，一方面劝他不要消极悲观，一方面帮助他去挑除田里的淤沙。他在萧明年互助组友爱行为的鼓舞下，也日夜挑除淤沙，准备补种。未受灾的地区，许多农民捐款援助灾民；受灾群众在得到援助后，正努力进行生产。
    目前南昌、新建等地洪水尚未退完，萍乡、新喻等县灾区善后工作尚未办理妥善；各县必须继续大力进行抢救和生产救灾工作，争取丰收。     （裘德和、彭光德）
