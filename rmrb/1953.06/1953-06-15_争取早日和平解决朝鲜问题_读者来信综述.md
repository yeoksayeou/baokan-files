    Strive for an Early Peaceful Resolution of the Korean Issue
    ——Summary of Reader Letters
    Recently, many readers have written to express their warm support and welcome for the agreement reached on the issue of prisoner of war repatriation, and they are determined to continue their efforts to strive for an early peaceful resolution of the Korean issue.

    Students from the Beijing Institute of Geology, Beijing Municipal No. 8 Middle School, and staff members from the Research and Education Department of the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government, among other units, wrote: "We wholeheartedly support the agreement on the issue of prisoner of war repatriation and fully support and promote its implementation." All letters pointed out that the agreement on the issue of prisoner of war repatriation has opened the way for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. This is a great victory for the world peace movement and will be unanimously welcomed by peace-loving people all over the world.

    Readers also pointed out in their letters: The resolution of the issue of prisoner of war repatriation is the result of the unremitting efforts of the people of China and Korea to strive for peace and the support of people all over the world. Readers Huang Yanchou, Lei Mingchun, and others wrote: "Since the discussion on the issue of prisoners of war began in December 1951, our side has consistently demonstrated a sincere desire to seek a solution to the issue of prisoner of war repatriation in order to achieve a ceasefire in Korea. However, due to the repeated obstruction by the U.S. side, the resolution of the issue of prisoner of war repatriation has been delayed for a long time. After our firm efforts and under the pressure of the people of the world, the U.S. side requested that the armistice negotiations enter an administrative meeting, which finally led to the reaching of this agreement." A student from Beijing Agricultural University wrote in a letter: From this agreement, it can be clearly seen that the consistent position taken by our side on the issue of prisoner of war repatriation in the past is completely reasonable and realistic, and the deceptive argument of "no forced repatriation" that the U.S. side has consistently promoted in the past has completely gone bankrupt.

    Zhang Xuefu of the Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government and the Student Union of Beijing Municipal No. 28 Middle School, among others, all said in their letters: This agreement has been reached, but we still need to continue to work hard to strive for an agreement on the entire Korean negotiation. American anti-armistice elements and the Syngman Rhee clique are still plotting to undermine the armistice and peace in Korea. All Chinese people must pay close attention to and be constantly vigilant against the war-mongers' conspiracy to undermine peace, and unremittingly strive to promote the smooth implementation of the agreement, promote the final peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, and promote the resolution of other international disputes through consultation!

    争取早日和平解决朝鲜问题
    ——读者来信综述
    最近许多读者纷纷来信对战俘遣返问题达成协议表示热烈的支持和欢迎，并决心继续努力，争取早日和平解决朝鲜问题。
    北京地质学院、北京市立第八中学学生和中央人民政府农业部研究教育司等单位的工作人员来信说：“我们衷心拥护关于战俘遣返问题的协议，并全力支持和促使其实现。”所有来信中都指出：战俘遣返问题的协议，打开了和平解决朝鲜问题的道路。这是世界和平运动的一个巨大胜利，必将得到全世界爱好和平的人们的一致欢迎。
    读者们在来信中又指出：战俘遣返问题的解决，是朝中两国人民为争取和平所作的不懈努力和全世界人民支持的结果。读者黄彦球、雷鸣春等来信说：“自从一九五一年十二月开始讨论关于战俘问题以来，我方一贯表现了谋求解决战俘遣返问题以实现朝鲜停战的真诚愿望，但由于美方的百般阻挠，战俘遣返问题的解决受到了长期的拖延。经过我方坚定的努力，并在世界人民的压力下，美方才要求停战谈判进入行政性会议，最后才使这一协议达成。”北京农业大学一学生来信说：从这一协议中可以清楚地看出，我方过去在战俘遣返问题上所采取的一贯立场是完全合理和实事求是的，美方过去
    一贯宣传的所谓“不得强迫遣返”的欺人论调完全破产了。
    中央人民政府铁道部张学富和北京市立第二十八中学学生会等在来信中都说：这个协议达成了，但我们还需要继续努力争取整个朝鲜谈判达成协议。美国反对停战分子和李承晚集团还正在阴谋破坏朝鲜的停战与和平。全中国人民一定要密切注视并时刻警惕战争贩子破坏和平的阴谋，为促使协议的顺利实现、促使朝鲜问题最后和平解决、并促使用协商方式解决其他国际争端而不懈地努力！
