    Turning Manual Operations into Machine Production
    ——On the Major Creation of Carpenter Huang Rongchang of the Southwest 101 Steel Plant
    Xiaoping

    Huang Rongchang, a carpenter at the Southwest 101 Steel Plant, utilized waste materials to manufacture twelve machines, transforming the manual carpentry workshop into a machine-operated workshop, increasing production efficiency by four hundred times and saving the country over ninety billion yuan annually. This February, the 101 Plant Committee of the Chinese Communist Party also made a decision on this matter, calling on everyone, especially workers engaged in physical labor, to learn from Comrade Huang Rongchang's spirit of diligent study, perseverance, and creation.

    Huang Rongchang is twenty-nine years old this year. Like other workers, he suffered immense hardships in the old society: farming, fleeing famine, learning carpentry, and enduring the oppression and exploitation of landlords and bosses. After the liberation of Chongqing, in October 1950, he entered the carpentry workshop of the property section of the 101 Plant. Like other workers, he found his home in the factory.

    Although the carpenters felt that the Communist Party was good, some were not at ease with their work, saying things like "Machine workers have a future, but manual work has no way out," and so on. Huang Rongchang was also quite dissatisfied with the work in the carpentry workshop. Listen, the factory is filled with the rumbling sound of machines, while the carpenters are chopping away with axes and pushing planes, straining their livers and lungs all day long, bending their backs. How slow, how clumsy! When will we get to socialism? Although Huang Rongchang was dissatisfied with his work, he was very settled. He had heard the reports of the returning representatives of the Volunteers. The Volunteers collected scrap shells, gasoline drums, and broken shell casings in such harsh environments to make many tools. Why can't we make machines in the rear? Aren't machines also assembled by workers' hands? Therefore, in 1951, when revising the patriotic pact, he proposed in the group to change manual operation to machine operation. Many people in the group said that he was daydreaming and thinking too far. Some said: "That's a fitter's job. A carpenter wants to make a machine, that's wishful thinking!" Some said that he had technical views and wanted a bonus, and some even said that he wanted to show off. When the matter reached the ears of Xiong Dazuo, the head of the property section (who was dismissed for corruption during the "Three-Anti" campaign), Xiong Dazuo said to him: "Making machines is not that simple. You have to design, draw, cast, and then use a lathe and milling machine. You're just a carpenter. Don't dream!" Surrounded by blows from all directions, Huang Rongchang did not waver. He thought, if you don't participate, I'll just start doing it myself. At this time, Song Jitian, the Party Committee's organization member who led their study, encouraged and supported him, saying: "As long as it's right, let's do it boldly. We must rely more on the leadership and the masses, and everything can succeed." Liu Guangdao, the chairman of the workshop's trade union, also agreed with him and often borrowed tools for him; workers Yang Youtai, Wei Binglin, and Tan Licheng also often helped him with the work. With support, Huang Rongchang had even greater confidence and determination.

    After work, he would run to the big scrap iron pile to find materials: steering wheels from cars, lifting bases from scrapped machines, gears, as well as dismantled ball plates, spindles, bushings, screws, and iron plates. As long as they were usable, he would disassemble them and carry them back one by one. The scrap iron pile became his big warehouse. While looking for scrap materials, he was also figuring out how to assemble them. Once, without tools, he used a steel wire saw used for wood carving to grind off a steel shaft two inches in diameter. Xiong Dazuo called him and said: "I told you not to do it, why do you insist on doing it? You are not allowed to do it without permission in the future! You are wasting state and people's property. You will be responsible if something goes wrong!" Huang Rongchang thought about it and couldn't understand the reasoning: I didn't take up working hours and didn't use good materials, why aren't I allowed to do it? If you don't allow it, I'll do it secretly without letting you see.

    Every noon, he didn't rest, but brought his meal to eat and worked until it was time to go to work. When he needed to dig a pit, he went to his "big warehouse" to find a broken crowbar, and he dug it open alone at night. He made a dustpan out of scrap iron sheets, tied a rope to it, piled the dug-out soil on the dustpan, and pulled it outside the workshop to dump it. Because if Xiong Dazuo saw the soil, he would be criticized again. He dug more and more vigorously, and later simply took off his shirt to work, and didn't even feel the pain when the skin on his shoulders was worn through. When his hands were so tired that he couldn't lift them, he thought that the Volunteers were also guarding us without sleeping, so he didn't know where the strength came from again. It wasn't until the cock crowed three times, the east turned white, and the pit was covered with wooden boards that he went back to sleep. When the pit was dug and the flywheel was to be installed, the flywheel weighed two hundred and fifty kilograms. He borrowed a pulley and spent another whole night to install it. But he was so tired that when he shook the flywheel, his body rushed forward, and he felt a numbness in his chest. When he looked down, his left chest to his left leg was chafed, and fresh blood was gushing out. He went to the emergency station to bandage it, and the next day he went to work as usual.

    His foreman was very angry when he saw that he was still working. One day, he sent him to the river two miles away to carry wood (this was work done by ordinary workers, Huang Rongchang was a fourth-grade technician), thinking that if you carried wood uphill and downhill for a day, would you still have the energy to do it at night? Huang Rongchang reported this matter to Song Jitian, who severely criticized the foreman at the meeting. From then on, some people did not dare to openly attack him.

    When the spring of 1952 came, Huang Rongchang, after experiencing untold hardships and racking his brains, finally created the first hand-cranked circular saw. During the trial run, the special agent Xu Xiang pretended to be active and used a wooden board with nails in it to test it, damaging the saw blade. Huang Rongchang spent several nights turning the hand-crank into a foot pedal, which was not only less labor-intensive than the hand-crank, but also increased efficiency. But the next morning, the flywheel was damaged and lying sideways in the pit. He thought that if the special agent was not caught, he should not think about making machines anymore! Ignoring Xu Xiang's appeasement and intimidation, he borrowed 30,000 yuan from the trade union and went with Wang Yiyun, the secretary of the Youth League branch, to the Minsheng Machinery Factory thirty miles away to collect materials on Xu Xiang. Because Xu Xiang had worked at the Minsheng Machinery Factory before liberation. The investigation confirmed that Xu Xiang was indeed a special agent, and the next day Xu Xiang was sent to court.

    Huang Rongchang was no longer afraid of the destruction of special agents, but he became thinner day by day. The trade union asked him to go to the workers' sanatorium for rest and recuperation more than once, but he refused to go. Until the third time he was asked to recuperate, he thought: his machine is too slow and too laborious, and it is not possible to use water for power. If the wheels of the factory's trains, which run back and forth all day long, are pushed back and forth with a big iron rod, and he installs it on his machine and uses a motor to drag it, wouldn't that be great? He thought so, but he was not sure and always wanted to ask a teacher. He thought that there were many veteran masters in the sanatorium who he could learn from, so he decided to go to the sanatorium to learn from a teacher.

    Huang Rongchang was treated extremely well in the sanatorium, and he felt even more uneasy. He thought that such good days are now exchanged for by the blood of countless revolutionary martyrs, but what have I given to the Party? He decided to make a circular saw and a gang saw on July 1, the Party's birthday, as a gift to the Party.

    Living next door to him was Xu Zhanyun, a fitter master, an excellent Communist Party member, and a Model Laborer Grade A. They hit it off as soon as they talked. Huang Rongchang told him about his idea of making machines and talked to him every night. Xu Zhanyun told him how to install and calculate the distance, and also taught him simple knowledge of AC and DC electricity. He encouraged him and said: "Today we are for the people and not for ourselves. We must have confidence, determination, and rely more on the masses to succeed." He also promised that if he lacked any tools, he could go to him.

    The sanatorium did not allow casual leave, which made Huang Rongchang anxious. His heart had already flown to the workshop and to his "big warehouse". He saw that Master Xu Zhanyun often went out to repair the water pump under the pretext of washing and changing clothes, preparing to make it a gift for the Party's birthday. He had a flash of inspiration. From then on, Huang Rongchang reappeared on the scrap iron pile every noon. It was during the hot days, and the sun baked his face black and his skin scorched, and sweat flowed non-stop, but he didn't feel it at all.

    Not long after Huang Rongchang left the sanatorium, the machine was about to be installed, and July 1 was approaching, but there was no motor. Fortunately, Comrade Song Ying of the Chongqing Municipal Federation of Trade Unions and Song Jitian and others supported him, so he managed to borrow the motor. Both machines were pieced together with various parts. Huang Rongchang made two red five-pointed stars and installed them on the machines. They were red and glowing, really beautiful!

    The day of the test run arrived, and he was so happy! The surroundings were crowded with people. When the power was turned on, the motor pulled the flywheel and roared. He was happy and a little scared. He was happy that the machine he had made himself was running today, and his ideal had become a reality. But seeing the machine turning so fast and so powerfully, shaking the ground, he was a little scared and didn't dare to get close. He paused for a moment before boldly feeding the wood up. He only heard a "hiss" sound, and what came out on the other side was a neat board. According to calculations, it was seventy-five times faster than manual operation, and the quality was completely qualified.

    After the machine was successfully manufactured, under his inspiration, the workers in the carpentry workshop all used their brains, overcame difficulties, and worked with Huang Rongchang to successively create twelve woodworking machines such as shuttle machines, drilling machines, cutting saws, rounding machines, traveling cranes, willow groove machines, hole punching machines, ?ke machines, large circular saws, and gang saws, freeing woodworking production from heavy manual operations. Huang Rongchang's success not only encouraged the workers of the 101 Plant, but also workers throughout Southwest China expressed that they would learn from him. Even the Volunteers far away in Korea, the People's Liberation Army far away in Xinjiang, and workers and students from other places wrote letters to him one after another, wanting to make him their role model. Now, Comrade Huang Rongchang has gloriously joined the Chinese Communist Party. Administratively, he has been promoted to a third-grade technician.

    把手工操作变成机器生产
    ——记西南一○一钢铁厂木工黄荣昌的重大创造
    小平
    西南一○一钢铁厂木工黄荣昌利用废料制造了十二部机器，使手工操作的木工房变成用机器操作的车间，提高生产效率四百倍，每年为国家节约九十多亿元。今年二月，中共一○一厂委员会还为此作了决定，号召大家，特别是靠体力劳动的工人们，学习黄荣昌同志刻苦钻研、坚持不懈的创造精神。
    黄荣昌今年二十九岁，跟别的工人们一样，他在旧社会曾经饱受千辛万苦：种过田、逃过荒，学过木工，受尽地主、老板的压迫和剥削。重庆解放以后，在一九五○年十月，他考进了一○一厂房产科木工房。也跟其他工人们一样，他在厂子里找到了自己的家。
    木工房工人们虽然都感到共产党好，可是有部分人对自己的工作不大安心，说什么“机器工人才有前途，手工业没有出路”等等。黄荣昌对木工房的工作也是挺不满意。你听，厂里到处响着轰隆隆的机器声音，而木工工人却在一斧头一斧头地砍，一刨子一刨子地推，整天摇肝摆肺，呵腰弯背的，多慢，多笨！什么时候才能走到社会主义呀？黄荣昌虽然对工作不满意，可是却很安心。他听过志愿军归国代表的报告，志愿军在那么艰苦的环境里，还搜集废炮弹、汽油桶、破弹皮，制造许多工具，为什么我们在后方不能制造机器呢？机器不也是靠工人的手安装起来的吗？因此，一九五一年，在修订爱国公约的时候，他在小组提出要改手工操作为机器操作，小组里很多人都说他胡思乱想，想的太空玄了。有的说：“那是钳工的活，一个木工要做机器，异想天开！”有的说他是技术观点，想得奖金，甚至有的说他想出出洋风头。事情传到房产科科长熊大佐（在“三反”中因贪污撤职）的耳朵里，熊大佐对他说：“做机器哪那么简单，要先设计、画图、翻砂，还要上车床车、铣，就你一个木工呀，别梦想了！”打击从四面向他袭击，黄荣昌并
    没有动摇。他想，你们不来参加，我就一个人先做起来再说。这时领导他们学习的党委组织委员宋吉
    田就鼓励、支持他，对他说：“只要是对的，我
    们就大胆地干下去吧。要多依靠领导，依靠群众，
    什么都能成功。”车间工会主席刘光道也赞成他，常
    常替他去借工具；工人杨友太、魏炳林、谭礼成也
    常常帮他作工。黄荣昌有了依靠，信心和决心便更
    大了。
    一下班，他就跑到大废铁堆去找材料：汽车上的方向盘、废机器上的升降座、牙轮，还有翻拆下来的弹子盘、轴心、布司、螺丝、铁板，只要可以用的，都一个个的拆卸好抬回来，废铁堆成了他的大仓库。他一面找废料，一面捉摸着怎么装。有一次，没有工具，他就用木工雕花用的钢丝锯，把一根直径两英寸的钢轴磨断了。熊大佐把他喊去说：“叫你不要搞，为什么偏要搞呢？以后没有批准就不准你搞！浪费国家人民财产，搞出了事，就由你负责！”黄荣昌想来想去想不通这个道理：我又没有占工作时间，又没有用好料，为什么不准搞呢？你不准，我就偷偷地搞，不给你看见。
    每天中午他不休息，把饭带去吃，一直做到上班。要挖坑了，他就到他的“大仓库”里找一把破洋撬，晚上一个人挖开了，他用废铁皮做个簸箕，上面系上一根绳子，把挖出的土，堆在簸箕上，再拉到车间外面倒了。因为要是被熊大佐看见了土，又要挨批评。他越挖越起劲，后来干脆脱光上衣来干，连肩头的皮磨破了都不觉得怎样痛。手累得抬不起来了，他想起志愿军不也是不睡觉在保卫着我们吗，就不知又从那里来了劲。直到鸡叫三遍，东方发白，用木板把坑盖好才回去睡觉。坑挖好，要装飞轮了，飞轮有二百五十公斤重，他借了个滑车，又花了个通夜才把它安装好。但人实在困乏，摇飞轮时，身子往前一冲，他感到胸口一麻，低头看时，左胸到左腿都磨擦伤了，鲜血直冒，他就到救急站去包扎好，第二天还是照常去上班。
    他的领班看到他还在干，心里很气。有一天，就派他到二里外的江边去搬木料（这是普通工人干的活，黄荣昌是四级技术工人），心想看你上坡下坡抬上一天木料还有精神在晚上干不？黄荣昌把这事报告给宋吉田，宋吉田在会上严厉地批评了领班。从此，一些人便不敢公开打击他了。
    一九五二年春天来到的时候，黄荣昌经历了千辛万苦，绞尽了心血的第一部手摇圆锯机终于造成了。试车时，特务徐相假装积极，去用一块钉了钉子的木板来试，把锯片弄坏了。黄荣昌又花了几个晚上，把手摇改为足踏，不但比手摇省力，并且效率也增高了。可是第二天早上，飞轮被弄坏了，横倒在土坑内。他想要是不把特务抓出来，就别再想做机器！他不顾徐相的拉拢恐吓，向工会借了三万元，和青年团支部书记王义云一齐赶到三十里外的民生机器厂去搜集徐相的材料。因为徐相在解放前曾在民生机器厂做过活。调查结果，果然证实徐相是特务，第二天徐相就被送到法院。
    黄荣昌不再怕特务的破坏了，可是他一天比一天瘦。工会不止一次让他去工人业余休养所休养，他都不肯去。直到第三次叫他休养时，他想：他的机器太慢、太费力了，用水来做动力，又办不到。如果像厂里的火车整天开来开去，轮子是用一个大铁杆推来推去，把他安装到他的机器上，再用马达来拖，不就好了吗？他这样想，可是又没有把握，总想请教一位老师。他想到休养所里有许多老师傅，可以向他们学习，便决定到休养所拜老师去。
    黄荣昌在休养所里受到了极好的招待，心里更是不安，他想现在这样好的日子，都是无数革命先烈用鲜血换来的，而我又给党什么呢？他决定在“七
    一”党的生日时，做好一部圆锯机、一部排锯机，作为给党的献礼。
    住在他隔壁的，有一位钳工老师傅徐占云，是优秀的共产党员，甲等劳动模范。他们一谈起来很投机。黄荣昌把自己想制造机器的事告诉他，天天晚上找他谈。徐占云告诉他如何安装、算距离，又教给他简单的交流电、直流电的常识。鼓励他说：
    “今天我们为人民，又不为个人，要有信心，有决心，要多依靠群众，才搞得成功。”还答应如差什么工具可以去找他。
    休养所不准随便请假，急得黄荣昌坐也不是，睡也不安，他的心早就飞到了车间，飞到他的“大仓库”里。关住了人，关不住心呀。他看见徐占云老师傅常常借故洗衣、换衣出去修理抽水机，准备把它作为党的生日的献礼。他灵机一动，从此，每天中午在废铁堆上又出现了黄荣昌，那时正是大热天，太阳像火一样烤得他面黑皮焦，汗水长流，可是他一点都不觉得。
    黄荣昌出休养所不久，机器快安装好，“七一”也快到来，就是没有马达。幸亏重庆市总工会的宋英同志和宋吉田等人都支持他，才算把马达借到。两部机器，都是各式各样的零件凑起来的，黄荣昌做了两个红五星，安在机器上，红得发光，真好看！
    试车的一天到了，他心里多么高兴呀！周围都围满了人。电门一开，马达拉着飞轮，轰隆隆地转了起来，他又高兴，又有点怕。高兴的是自己亲自做成的机器，今天转动了起来，他的理想成了现实。但看到机器转的那么快，那么厉害，震得连地都在抖，又有点怕，不敢挨拢。他怔了一下，才大着胆把木料向上一喂，只听“嘶”的一声，那边出来的，就是整整齐齐的板子。一计算，比手工操作快七十五倍，质量完全合格。
    机器制造成功了，在他的感召下，木工房的工人们，纷纷动脑筋，克服困难，和黄荣昌一块，先后创造了梭柽机、钻眼机、切锯机、落尖机、行车、采柳拉槽机、打眼机、?科机、大圆锯机、排锯机等十二部木工机器，使木工生产从笨重的手工操作中解放了出来。黄荣昌的成功不仅鼓励了一○一厂的工人，全西南的工人们表示要向他学习，连远在朝鲜的志愿军、远在新疆的解放军和其他各地的工人、学生们也纷纷给他写信，要以他作自己的榜样。现在，黄荣昌同志已光荣地参加了中国共产党。行政上已提升他为三级技术员。
