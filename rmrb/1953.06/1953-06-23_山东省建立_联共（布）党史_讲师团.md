    In order to actively prepare for the study of Chapters IX to XII of the "History of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)," which will begin after July, the Propaganda Department of the Shandong Branch of the CPC Central Committee officially issued a notice on May 25 to establish a lecturers' group. Currently, the lecturers' group directly under the provincial government has been formally established.
    The notice pointed out: Establishing a lecturers' group to strengthen the theoretical guidance of cadre study, improve learning effectiveness, and overcome the spontaneous state of theoretical study in the past is a crucial issue in the current preparation work. Party committees at all levels, in addition to actively carrying out various preparatory tasks, must seize this critical issue.
    In addition to specifically identifying the list of lecturers for the lecturers' group directly under the provincial government, the notice also clearly stipulated the tasks of the lecturers' group, the method of formulating lecture outlines, and the arrangement of the daily work of the comrades in the lecturers' group. Most of the lecturers in the lecturers' group directly under the provincial government are concurrently held by responsible comrades from various departments who have relatively high theoretical literacy. Those already decided by the Shandong Branch include: Wang Zhongyin, Guan Feng, Zhou Nan, Li Shuxiang, Yang Xiwen, Yu Xunchen, and 30 other comrades. The specific task of the lecturers' group is to write lecture outlines under the guidance of the Propaganda Department of the branch, give lectures to middle-level cadres, and answer difficult questions related to the study. In order to give the lecturers time to conduct research and prepare lessons, departments should appropriately reduce their daily work and allow them to take a day off before each lecture as preparation time. At the same time, a certain lecture fee will be given for each lecture to encourage them.
    In order to solve the problem of teachers for economic construction theory study in various parts of the province, the Propaganda Department of the Shandong Branch instructed the municipal and prefectural party committees to also identify a group of theory teachers and come to participate in the discussion on the lecture outline of the lecturers' group directly under the provincial government.
    In order to start the preparatory work as soon as possible, the Propaganda Department of the branch convened the first meeting of the provincial-level lecturers' group on May 20, and discussed in detail and determined the division of labor, content and requirements of the lectures. The thirty lecturers were divided into four groups, with each group responsible for lecturing on one chapter. The drafting of the lecture outline was undertaken separately by each group. In addition to repeated research and formulation by each group, the lecture outline for each chapter will also be discussed by all lecturers in a concentrated manner for half a month (and study counselors will be included), and finally reviewed and approved by the Shandong Branch of the CPC Central Committee as the final draft. During the study process, the Shandong Branch will also organize senior cadres to report on the national and provincial economic situation and party policies at appropriate times. It is estimated that lectures will be given once every three weeks. When the entire course is completed, there will be approximately twenty-one lectures.
    Currently, the comrades of the lecturers' group have completed other learning tasks and are devoting themselves to the study of Chapters IX to XII of the "History of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)."

    山东省建立“联共（布）党史”讲师团
    为积极准备迎接七月份以后开始的“联共（布）党史”第九章至十二章的学习，中共中央山东分局宣传部已于五月二十五日正式发出建立讲师团的通知，目前省直属机关讲师团已正式组成。
    通知中指出：建立讲师团以加强干部学习的理论指导、提高学习效果、克服过去理论学习中的自流状态，是目前准备工作中具有关键性的问题，各级党委除应积极做好各项准备工作外，必须抓紧这一带有关键性的问题。
    通知中除将省直属机关讲师团的讲师名单加以具体确定外，并对讲师团的任务、讲授提纲的拟定办法，以及讲师团同志日常工作的安排等问题，都作了明确的规定。省直属机关讲师团的讲师绝大部分是由各部门较有理论修养的负责同志兼任，已经由山东分局决定者有：王众音、关锋、周南、李书厢、杨希文、于勋忱等三十位同志。讲师团的具体任务是在分局宣传部的指导下，负责编写讲授提纲，分别向中级组干部讲课，以及解答有关学习中的疑难问题。为了使各讲师有时间进行研究、备课，各部门除应适当减轻其日常工作外，于每次上课前，允许其请假一天，作为备课时间。同时，每上一次课，都给予一定的讲课费，以资鼓励。
    为了解决全省各地在经济建设理论学习的教员问题，山东分局宣传部指示各市委、地委亦须确定一批理论教员，并前来参加省直属机关讲师团关于讲授提纲的讨论。
    分局宣传部为使准备工作及早开始，已于五月二十日召开了省级机关讲师团第一次会议，详细讨论并确定了讲师的分工、讲授内容和要求等问题。三十位讲师，共分成四个小组，每组负责讲授一章。讲授提纲的草拟由各小组分别担任。每章讲授提纲除先经本小组反复研究拟定外，还将以半月时间集中全体讲师进行讨论（并吸收学习辅导员参加），最后由中共中央山东分局审查批准作为定稿。在学习过程中，还将由山东分局在适当时期组织高级干部作有关全国和该省经济情况和党的政策的报告。讲课预计每三周讲一次。全部学完时大致可讲课二十一次。
    目前讲师团的同志已结束了其他学习任务，正致力于“联共（布）党史”第九至十二章的学习。
