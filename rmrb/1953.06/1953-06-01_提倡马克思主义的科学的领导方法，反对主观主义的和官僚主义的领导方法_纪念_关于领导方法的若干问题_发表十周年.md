    Advocate Marxist Scientific Leadership Methods, Oppose Subjectivist and Bureaucratic Leadership Methods
    —Commemorating the Tenth Anniversary of the Publication of “Some Questions Concerning Methods of Leadership”
    Sun Dingguo
    Comrade Mao Zedong's "Some Questions Concerning Methods of Leadership" scientifically summarized our Party's historical experience in leadership methods. Comrade Mao Zedong thoroughly resolved the most fundamental issues concerning the Party's leadership methods by elevating them to the height of Marxist epistemology and historical materialism. This famous document is our Party's unparalleled sharp weapon in adhering to Marxist leadership methods and opposing subjectivist and bureaucratic leadership methods in any period and in any work.
    Since its publication on June 1, 1943, this famous document has powerfully attracted and guided leading cadres at all levels of the Party to consciously learn the art of leadership theoretically and practically. The ideas and methods it expounds—that correct leadership must come from the masses and go to the masses, and that general and individual, leadership and the masses must be combined—have long been gradually familiarized and mastered by a considerable number of leading cadres of the Party and the state. Thus, the Party, through them, has powerfully led the people of the whole country through major historical events in the past decade, conducted arduous wars, complex political struggles, and many great social reform movements. Because the Party has effectively applied the leadership methods prescribed by Comrade Mao Zedong, it has effectively pushed the Chinese revolution step by step toward new victories.
    However, regarding Marxist leadership methods, not all leading cadres in our Party and state organs have thoroughly resolved them, and particularly those who can comprehend leadership methods by elevating them to the height of Marxist epistemology and historical materialism cannot be said to be very, very many. That is to say, subjectivist and bureaucratic leadership methods still exist to a considerable degree in our Party and state organs. The damage they have inflicted on the state and the people, as evidenced by the serious facts revealed in the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" campaigns, as well as the recently launched anti-bureaucracy struggle, is already evident to all. Therefore, Comrade Mao Zedong wrote in the conclusion of "Some Questions Concerning Methods of Leadership": "Subjectivists and bureaucrats do not know the principles of combining leadership with the masses and combining the general with the individual, and greatly hinder the development of the Party's work. In order to oppose subjectivist and bureaucratic leadership methods, it is necessary to widely and deeply advocate Marxist scientific leadership methods." This still retains its new and practical significance for our situation today.
    I. Comprehending Marxist epistemology and historical materialism is the key to comprehending Marxist leadership methods.
    Some comrades regard leadership methods as a technique, a method, and some even regard it as a means to achieve their own subjective desires and intentions. Obviously, these views are completely wrong. Because they do not understand that Marxist leadership methods are closely integrated with Marxist epistemology and historical materialism. Only under the illumination of Marxist epistemology and historical materialism can there be scientific Marxist leadership methods. This is the key to the problem.
    In the fourth section of "Some Questions Concerning Methods of Leadership," Comrade Mao Zedong wrote: "In all practical work of our Party, correct leadership must come from the masses, to the masses. This means: take the ideas of the masses (scattered and unsystematic ideas) and concentrate them (through study turn them into concentrated and systematic ideas), then go to the masses and propagate and explain these ideas until the masses embrace them as their own, stand by them and defend them as their own, and translate them into action and test the correctness of these ideas in such action. Then once again concentrate ideas from the masses and once again go to the masses so that the ideas are persevered in and carried through. And so on, over and over again in an endless spiral with the ideas becoming more correct, more vital and richer each time. Such is the Marxist theory of knowledge."
    Here, Comrade Mao Zedong prominently clarified that our Party's basic leadership method is guided by Marxist epistemology. What he pointed out here—coming from the masses and then returning to the masses—is materialism in leadership methods; the endless cycle of concentration and perseverance is dialectics in leadership methods. Party and state leaders must strictly adhere to Marxist epistemology in order to truthfully reflect the laws of objective things and ensure the correctness and scientific nature of their leadership methods. The reason why subjectivist and bureaucratic leadership methods are wrong is primarily because they violate materialism, violate dialectics, and violate Marxist epistemology.
    As everyone knows, regarding Marxist epistemology, Comrade Mao Zedong made a comprehensive analysis in his famous philosophical work "On Practice," and it is concentratedly expressed in the final conclusion of "On Practice." The entire fourth section of Comrade Mao Zedong's document can be said to be the conclusion of "On Practice," a summary of "On Practice" as expressed in the question of leadership methods.
    Regarding Marxist historical materialism, Comrade Stalin made the following classic statement: "The history of social development is first and foremost the history of the development of production... From this it is evident that the history of social development is at the same time the history of the producers of material values themselves, the history of the labouring masses who are the fundamental force in the process of production and who carry on the production of the material values essential to the existence of society." [1]
    In a word, history is the history of the laboring masses, the history of the people. This is the Marxist scientific historical materialism of the laboring masses creating history.
    This scientific historical materialism is precisely the fundamental starting point of the mass line leadership method prescribed by Comrade Mao Zedong for our Party, which consists of coming from the masses and going to the masses. Regarding this issue, Comrade Liu Shaoqi made an extremely important and detailed analysis and explanation in his book "On the Party." He wrote:
    "The viewpoint of everything for the people, the viewpoint of being responsible to the people in everything, the viewpoint of believing that the masses liberate themselves, the viewpoint of learning from the people—all this is our mass viewpoint, the viewpoint of the advanced troops of the people toward the people. When our comrades have these viewpoints, when they have these solid and clear mass viewpoints, they can have a clear mass line in their work, and they can implement correct leadership." [2]
    The greatest misfortune of subjectivist and bureaucratic leadership methods lies in their failure to understand this simplest yet most basic truth. They blindly violate the Marxist scientific historical materialism (which is the inevitable result of their violation of Marxist epistemology), and thus also violate the Party's mass line leadership method. They have not yet deeply understood the profound significance of the following passage in Comrade Liu Shaoqi's "On the Party":
    "This mass line of ours is something that only a proletarian party can possess. Our mass line is also a class line, it is the proletarian mass line. Our viewpoint toward the people, our relationship with the people, is fundamentally different from the viewpoint of all exploiting classes toward the people and their relationship with the people." [3]
    It should be pointed out that it is precisely on the basis of the proletarian view of history that the mass line leadership method arose; and it is precisely on the basis of the non-proletarian view of history that subjectivist and bureaucratic leadership methods arose. The fundamental dividing line can only be here.
    Therefore, our conclusion is: coming from the masses and going to the masses is the basic core of some questions concerning methods of leadership, and it is determined by Marxist epistemology and historical materialism. If we want to deeply understand it and apply it in practice, we must first work hard on epistemology and historical materialism. For those who suffer from subjective and bureaucratic problems, this is a major ideological revolution, a matter of changing their minds.
    II. The combination of the general and the individual, and the combination of leadership and the masses, are two basic methods for concretely implementing the leadership line of coming from the masses and going to the masses.
    Having correct principles, there must also be correct methods of implementation. So, in leadership work, how can we come from the masses and how can we return to the masses? Comrade Mao Zedong tells us two basic methods: one is the method of combining the general and the individual, and the other is the method of combining leadership and the masses.
    Regarding the method of combining the general and the individual, Comrade Mao Zedong wrote:
     "For any task, if there is no general and universal call, it is impossible to mobilize the broad masses to take action. But if it is limited to a general call, and the leaders do not specifically and directly implement the work that has been called for deeply in several organizations, break through a point, gain experience, and then use this experience to guide other units, it is impossible to test whether the general call they have made is correct, and it is also impossible to enrich the content of the general call, and there is a danger of making the general call fall through."
    Comrade Mao Zedong raised two extremely important issues here: the issue of leaders carrying out their general calls to the end, and the issue of leaders combining guidance and learning.
    Breaking through a point, gaining experience, and promoting the overall situation is the most reliable materialist method. Comrade Mao Zedong often taught us to adhere to methods such as "the head of the organization is responsible and does it himself," "focus on demonstration," and "from point to area" in any work. There is only one basic requirement here, and that is to require leaders to first go deep into a point, to excavate the essence of objective things, to find the key and laws in the work, so that their guidance methods can be firmly established on the basis of dialectical materialism. This is as Comrade Mao Zedong wrote in "On Practice": "If you want to directly know something or some things, you can only participate in the practical struggle to change reality, to change something or some things, in order to touch the phenomenon of that or those things, and only by personally participating in the practical struggle to change reality can the essence of that or those things be revealed and understood." [4] The view that "knowledge comes from practice" is not dispensable for a leader, but extremely important. Taking the example of the bumper harvest experience in Zhaoyuan County, Northeast China [5], ask: if Comrade Ren Guodong had not first grasped individual villages like Sihetun and delved into them, could he have created valuable production experiences that could be promoted throughout the county and even throughout Northeast China? Of course not.
    Another important aspect of the method of combining the individual and the general lies in its ability to attract leaders to look downward, to humbly learn from the masses and to learn from lower levels. Obtain specific experiences from individual units and specific events, and conduct universal guidance. Comrade Mao Zedong set an outstanding example for us in this regard. For example, in 1934, Comrade Mao Zedong summarized the examples of two model townships, Changgang Township in Jiangxi and Caixi Township in Fujian, and wrote the famous thesis "Concern Ourselves with the Well-Being of the Masses, Pay Attention to Methods of Work" [6]; and in 1945, Comrade Mao Zedong analyzed the experience of the production movement of the guerrillas in the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region and wrote the famous editorial "Guerrilla Areas Can Also Engage in Production" [7]. These famous articles had an incredibly powerful driving force for general calls at the time, and even today they are still brilliant examples of our Party's leadership method of combining the individual and the general. It should be pointed out that this method has become one of the fine traditions of our Party. The Hao Jianxiu Work Method [8] summarized by the All-China Textile Workers' Union in 1951, and the experience of the trade union work of the Northeast May 3rd Factory promoted by the All-China Federation of Trade Unions in 1952, are concrete developments of this fine tradition. From these examples, we can see good examples of combining leadership and learning, and we can also see the true source of our Party's strong leadership over the masses.
    This question is indeed worthy of deep thought for some leaders who sit in their offices and never go out, but just bury themselves in piles of documents and make long-distance "travels."
    Regarding the question of combining leadership and the masses, Comrade Mao Zedong, in conjunction with the Party's rectification experience, prominently clarified the ninth point of Comrade Stalin's twelve conditions for the Bolshevization of the Party—the question of establishing a leading core. Comrade Mao Zedong believed that forming a leading backbone of a small number of activists with the main person in charge of the unit as the core during the movement, and closely integrating this leading backbone with the broad masses, is a method that must be observed in carrying out all work. Therefore, he emphasized: we should apply this method mentioned by Comrade Stalin "to all large and small organs, schools, troops, factories and rural areas."
    It cannot be conceived that the masses create their own history apart from the leadership of our Party; similarly, we cannot imagine our Party's connection with the masses and leadership over the masses as merely a kind of boundless roaming in the sea of the masses. The ideas of spontaneism and tailism have always been opposed by us.
    Precisely because of this, the idea of establishing a leading core and cultivating leading backbones is an indispensable basic condition for the broad masses to liberate themselves, and thus one of the basic methods for us to lead the masses in their struggle.
    Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out: "In any place where there are masses, there are roughly three parts of people: the relatively active, the intermediate, and the relatively backward. Therefore, leaders must be good at uniting a small number of activists as the backbone of leadership, and rely on this group of backbones to raise the intermediate elements and win over the backward elements."
    This scientific method of analyzing the internal state of the masses is the basic starting point for us to adhere to the correct mass line. There is a fundamental difference between the consciousness of the masses and the consciousness of our Party, and there is a significant difference in the degree of consciousness among the masses. So how will the Party lead the masses forward? It is necessary to combine revolutionary politicians and mass politicians. Only this combination can produce the mutual combination of the enthusiasm of leading the revolution and the enthusiasm of the broad masses; and only this combination can produce a truly broad mass movement under the leadership of the Party with a core, backbone, and organization.
    It should be pointed out that under the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong, this method has also become one of the fine traditions of our Party.
    Taking the bumper harvest experience in Zhaoyuan County as an example again, Comrade Ren Guodong succeeded by using this basic method. He relied closely on Yu Changjiang, the secretary of the Sihetun branch, Yu Wanyou, the village chief of Yong'an Village, and Wang Zhentang, a national agricultural labor model—these backbones of activists—thereby concentrating the masses' production experience and creating new cultivation methods; and in order to promote it throughout the county, he firmly grasped this basic method, trained more than 12,000 mutual aid team leaders, more than 1,000 propagandists, and more than 30,000 women, and cultivated them into a strong group of production backbones.
    In his article "Be Concerned With Economic Work," Comrade Mao Zedong gave the following instructions to labor heroes and model workers: "You have three strengths and play three roles. First, a leading role. This is because you work especially hard, have many creations, and your work has become a model for ordinary people, raising work standards and causing everyone to learn from you. Second, a backbone role. Most of you are not yet cadres, but you are already the backbone of the masses, the core of the masses. With you, work is easier to promote. In the future, you may become cadres, you are now reserve forces for cadres. Third, a bridging role. You are the bridge between the leaders above and the broad masses below. The opinions of the masses are passed up through you, and the opinions above are passed down through you." [9] This is a profound and vivid description of the method of combining leading backbones and the broad masses. On September 25, 1950, when Comrade Mao Zedong delivered a congratulatory speech on behalf of the CPC Central Committee to the National Conference of Combat Heroes and the National Conference of Labor Models of Workers, Peasants and Soldiers, he emphasized: "In the struggle to eliminate the enemy, in the struggle to restore and develop industrial and agricultural production, you have overcome many difficulties and hardships, and demonstrated great courage, wisdom, and enthusiasm. You are model figures of the entire Chinese nation, the backbone for promoting the victorious advance of the people's cause in all aspects, the reliable pillars of the People's Government, and the bridge connecting the People's Government with the broad masses." [10] From this, we can fully see the importance of this method.
    However, according to the materials we have recently contacted, when applying this method, because some of our comrades have not recognized such a problem by raising it to the height of Marxist historical materialism, there are still many deviations in practical work.
    These deviations often take two forms of expression: one is the form of replacing the advanced with the backward, and the other is the form of replacing the backward with the advanced.
    The most prominent example of the form of replacing the advanced with the backward is the errors of economism and syndicalism that some factories and mines once committed in our trade union work. This tendency mistakenly regards the demands of some backward elements among the workers as the demands of all workers, especially the demands of progressive elements among the workers, and therefore does not dare to boldly promote the Communist Party and Communism in the ranks of workers. Obviously, this is a right-leaning manifestation that violates the principle of combining leading backbones and the masses; this right-leaning manifestation will inevitably develop into tailism, and the result is the loss of the possibility of cultivating activists and establishing backbones, and of course there is no talk of raising the middle and winning over the backward.
    The most prominent example of the form of replacing the backward with the advanced is the errors of blindly advancing that some areas once committed in our rural work. This tendency mistakenly regards the ideas of some advanced elements among the peasants as the ideas of all peasants, especially the ideas of backward elements among the peasants, and therefore blindly expands in the work of developing agricultural production cooperatives without estimating the actual conditions or conducting typical demonstrations. Obviously, this is a "left"-leaning manifestation that violates the principle of combining leading backbones and the masses. This "left"-leaning manifestation will inevitably develop into commandism, and the result is the isolation of activists, scaring away the intermediate elements, and of course there is no possibility of winning over the backward elements.
    Comrade Mao Zedong once made extremely profound criticisms of these two tendencies. He said: "In all work, commandism is wrong, because it exceeds the level of consciousness of the masses, violates the principle of voluntary participation of the masses, and suffers from acute illness... In all work, tailism is also wrong, because it lags behind the level of consciousness of the masses, violates the principle of leading the masses to move forward, and suffers from chronic illness." [11]
    Whether "left" or right, whether acute or chronic, their common error, in the final analysis, is because their leadership methods directly violate the principle of combining leadership and the masses. Because they still lack a deep Marxist historical materialism and a mass viewpoint consistent with Marxist historical materialism, they cannot accurately grasp the laws of production development and the laws of mass movement, so as to correctly and effectively implement the Party's policies and make the masses naturally revolutionize under the leadership of the Party. The root cause of the error of being either "left" or right, of supporting the East and then falling to the West, lies mainly here.
    Regarding the question of combining leading backbones and the masses, Comrade Mao Zedong also emphasized the following two principles: "All leading backbones who are truly united and connected with the masses must be gradually formed from the struggle of the masses, and cannot be formed by being separated from the struggle of the masses"; "The standard of this kind of leading backbone should be the four standards of cadres raised by Dimitrov in his theory of cadre policy (unlimited loyalty, connection with the masses, independent working ability, and compliance with discipline)." If these principles are violated, it will be difficult for real leading backbones to form, and the dangerous seeds of being separated from the masses will be planted. This is because the formation of this kind of "backbone" is not truly tempered from the flames of the struggle of the masses, so they cannot be the figures truly loved by the masses. This question is still worth our strict grasp and hard study in practice today.
    Therefore, our conclusion is: to thoroughly implement the mass line leadership method of coming from the masses and going to the masses, we must adhere to the combination of the individual and the general, and the combination of leadership and the masses. And these two are mutually complementary and indispensable. To truly implement this basic method, we must analyze it from the perspective of Marxist epistemology and historical materialism.
    III. Adhering to unification and adhering to the leadership method of having only one central task in a certain period is the basic method for opposing bureaucratism, commandism, and decentralism.
    After repeatedly explaining several basic issues in leadership methods in this document, Comrade Mao Zedong also raised the leadership method of adhering to unification in the seventh section and the issue of adhering to having only one central task in a certain period in the eighth section. This is of great theoretical guiding significance for our struggle against bureaucratism and commandism and resisting decentralism today.
    In order to thoroughly solve these problems ideologically for some leaders and further strive for a major victory in opposing bureaucratism and commandism, deeply studying these seventh and eighth sections is still the fundamental solution.
    In the seventh section of this document, Comrade Mao Zedong emphasized that for any task to be conveyed downward, it must be through the main person in charge of the lower-level organs, so that he is responsible, to achieve the purpose of division of labor and unity, that is, to achieve the purpose that the chief person in charge of the lower level and the persons in charge of each division know and are responsible. This method of strengthening the unification of leadership, on the one hand, as Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out, "this is also a form of combining leadership and the masses," because the chief person in charge can promote and organize more or all of the personnel to carry out this work; and on the other hand, this precisely blocks the gate of the scourge of decentralism of multi-headed leadership. Some comrades who are unwilling to center on the leadership of the Party committee and make some independence or like to emphasize their own so-called "vertical system" relationship often directly violate this method of unified leadership.
    It should be deeply recognized that the fundamental principle of the Party's unification has a serious effect on the revolutionary cause of the Party and the state. If tolerating the development of decentralism caused serious losses to the Party and the people in the past, then today, when our country is moving towards industrialization (industrialization requires a high degree of concentration), the losses it will give to the Party and the people will be many times more serious.
    In the eighth section of this document, Comrade Mao Zedong also emphasized: "In any region, there cannot be many central tasks at the same time. In a certain period of time, there can only be one central task, supplemented by other secondary and tertiary tasks." Obviously, this is the most practical instruction for opposing decentralism and overcoming the "five excesses" phenomenon in recent rural work. The fundamental idea of this instruction is completely consistent with the idea of solving the main contradictions expounded by Comrade Mao Zedong in "On Contradiction." "On Contradiction" tells us this: in practical work, we must grasp the main contradictions and solve the main problems. Therefore, in a certain period of time, there can only be one central task, and there cannot be many central tasks. The auxiliary work placed in the second and third positions can only be carried out around the central task. Oppose egalitarianism, oppose dispersing forces. This is just like fighting, only one fist can hit people, not two fists. Because there can only be one main attack, and the restraint aspect is only to ensure and develop the victory of the main attack aspect. Comrade Mao Zedong's idea of solving the main contradictions is precisely Comrade Lenin's idea of grasping the special link. Comrade Lenin said: "It is not enough to be merely a revolutionary and a supporter of socialism or a communist in general. It is necessary to be able to find a special link on the chain in every opportunity, and this link must be grasped with all the strength in order to grasp the entire chain and steadily prepare for the transition to the next link; at the same time, in the historical chain of the development of events, the order of each link, their forms, their connection, and their differences from each other are not as simple and clumsy as ordinary chains made by blacksmiths." [12] Lenin emphatically pointed out the problem of grasping the special link on the chain in revolutionary work, and at the same time pointed out the difficulty of grasping the special link on this chain. We know that it is precisely in this sense that Comrade Mao Zedong wrote: "This is an art of leadership." In this respect, our comrades should humbly learn to master this art. This is the key to fully implementing the central tasks of the Party and the state and overcoming the "five excesses" phenomenon.
    Therefore, our conclusion is: adhere to unification and oppose and resist decentralism, adhere to the central task and overcome the "five excesses" phenomenon. This is effective for carrying out the struggle against bureaucratism and commandism.

    提倡马克思主义的科学的领导方法，反对主观主义的和官僚主义的领导方法
    ——纪念“关于领导方法的若干问题”发表十周年
    孙定国
    毛泽东同志的“关于领导方法的若干问题”，科学地总结了我们党在历史上关于领导方法的经验。毛泽东同志把关于党的领导方法的最根本问题，提到马克思主义认识论和历史观的高度加以彻底的解决。这个著名的文件是我们党在任何时期和任何工作中，坚持马克思主义的领导方法，反对主观主义的和官僚主义的领导方法的无比锐利的武器。
    这个著名的文件自从一九四三年六月一日公布以来，就有力地吸引着和指引着党的各级领导干部，从理论上、实践上来自觉地学习领导工作的艺术。它所阐述的正确的领导必须从群众中来、到群众中去，以及一般和个别相结合、领导和群众相结合的思想和方法，早已为党和国家的相当数量的领导干部所逐渐熟悉，逐渐掌握，从而党又通过他们有力地领导着全国人民，经历了十年来的重大历史事变，进行了艰苦的战争，复杂的政治斗争和许多次的巨大社会改革运动。由于党是有成效地运用了毛泽东同志所规定的这种领导方法，党也就有成效地把中国革命一步一步地推向新的胜利。
    但是，关于马克思主义的领导方法，在我们党和国家机关中，还不是所有的领导干部都已经彻底解决了的，特别是能够把领导方法提到马克思主义认识论和历史观的高度上来领会的人，还不能说是很多很多的。这就是说，在我们党和国家机关中，主观主义的和官僚主义的领导方法，还是相当严重地存在着的。它所给予国家和人民的损害，从“三反”、“五反”以及最近所展开的反官僚主义的斗争所暴露出来的种种带有严重性质的事实看来，已经是有目共睹的了。因此，毛泽东同志在“关于领导方法的若干问题”的结语中所写的：“主观主义者和官僚主义者不知道领导和群众相结合、一般和个别相结合的原则，极大地妨碍党的工作的发展。为了反对主观主义的和官僚主义的领导方法，必须广泛地深入地提倡马克思主义的科学的领导方法。”这对于我们今天的情况说来，依然保持着崭新的现实意义。
    一、领会马克思主义的认识论和历史观，是领会马克思主义领导方法的关键。
    有的同志把领导方法当作一种技术一种办法，甚至有人把它当作一种达到自己的主观愿望和意图的手段来看。显然，这些看法都是完全错误的。因为他们不懂得马克思主义的领导方法，乃是和马克思主义的认识论和历史观紧密地结合在一起的。只有在马克思主义的认识论和历史观的思想照耀之下，才可能有科学的马克思主义的领导方法。这就是问题的关键所在。
    毛泽东同志在“关于领导方法的若干问题”的第四节中写道：“在我党的一切实际工作中，凡属正确的领导，必须是从群众中来，到群众中去。这就是说，将群众的意见（分散的无系统的意见）集中起来（经过研究，化为集中的系统的意见），又到群众中去作宣传解释，化为群众的意见，使群众坚持下去，见之于行动，并在群众行动中考验这些意见是否正确。然后再从群众中集中起来，再到群众中坚持下去。如此无限循环，一次比一次地更正确、更生动、更丰富。这就是马克思主义的认识论。”
    毛泽东同志在这里突出地阐明了我们党的基本领导方法，是以马克思主义的认识论为其指导原则的。他在这里所指出的从群众中来，然后回到群众中去，这就是领导方法上的唯物主义；集中起来，而又坚持下去的无限循环，这就是领导方法上的辩证法。党和国家的领导工作者，必须严格遵守马克思主义的认识论，才能够如实地反映客观事物的规律性，才能够保证自己在领导方法上的正确性和科学性。主观主义和官僚主义的领导方法之所以是错误的，这首先就是由于他们违反了唯物主义，违反了辩证法，违反了马克思主义的认识论。
    大家知道，关于马克思主义的认识论，毛泽东同志在他的著名的哲学著作“实践论”里，作过全面的分析，而且集中地表现在“实践论”的最后结论中。毛泽东同志的这个文件第四节的全文，可以说就是“实践论”的结论，是“实践论”表现在领导方法问题上的缩写。
    关于马克思主义的历史观，斯大林同志有过如下的经典说法：“社会发展史首先便是生产发展史，……由此可见，社会发展史同时也就是物质资料生产者本身底历史，即身为生产过程中基本力量并实现着社会生存所必需物质资料生产的那些劳动群众底历史。”〔一〕
    一句话，历史是劳动群众的历史，是人民的历史。这就是马克思主义的劳动群众创造历史的科学历史观。
    这种科学的历史观，正是毛泽东同志为我们党所规定的从群众中来，到群众中去的群众路线的领导方法的根本出发点。关于这个问题，刘少奇同志在“论党”一书中作了极为重要而且详细的分析和说明。他写道：
    “一切为了人民群众的观点，一切向人民群众负责的观点，相信群众自己解放自己的观点，向人民群众学习的观点，这一切，就是我们的群众观点，就是人民群众的先进部队对人民群众的观点。我们同志有了这些观点，有了坚固的明确的这些群众观点，才能有明确的工作中的群众路线，才能实行正确的领导。”〔二〕
    主观主义和官僚主义领导方法的最大不幸之处，就在于他们不懂得这样一条最简单的但又是最基本的真理，他们盲目地违反了马克思主义的科学的历史观（这是他们违反了马克思主义认识论的必然的结果），因而也就违反了党的群众路线的领导方法。他们还没有深刻地了解刘少奇同志在“论党”中所说的如下一段话的深刻意义：
    “我们的这种群众路线，是只有无产阶级的政党才能具有的。我们的群众路线，也就是阶级路线，就是无产阶级的群众路线。我们对人民群众的这种观点，我们与人民群众的这种关系，是和一切剥削阶级对待人民群众的观点及其与人民群众的关系，根本不相同的。”〔三〕
    应该指出：正是在无产阶级的历史观的基础之上，才产生了群众路线的领导方法；正是在非无产阶级的历史观的基础之上，才产生了主观主义官僚主义的领导方法。问题的根本的分界线只能在这里。
    因此，我们的结论是：从群众中来，到群众中去，这是关于领导方法若干问题的基本核心，它是被马克思主义的认识论和历史观所规定了的。我们要深刻地理解它并且要在实际中去运用它，就必须首先从认识论和历史观上下工夫。这对于患有主观的和官僚主义毛病的人们，是一个思想上的大革命，是一个换脑筋的问题。
    二、一般和个别相结合、领导和群众相结合是具体地贯彻从群众中来、到群众中去的领导路线的两个基本方法。
    有了正确的原则，还必须有正确的贯彻的方法。那么在领导工作中，怎样才能从群众中来又怎样才能回到群众中去呢？毛泽东同志告诉我们两个基本方法：一个是一般和个别相结合的方法，另一个是领导和群众相结合的方法。
    关于一般和个别相结合的方法，毛泽东同志写道：
     “任何工作任务，如果没有一般的普遍的号召，就不能动员广大的群众行动起来。但如果只限于一般号召，而领导人员没有具体地直接地从若干组织将所号召的工作深入实施，突破一点，取得经验，然后利用这种经验去指导其他单位，就无法考验自己提出的一般号召是否正确，也无法充实一般号召的内容，就有使一般号召归于落空的危险。”
    毛泽东同志在这里提出了两个极为重要的问题，这就是领导人员要把自己的一般号召贯彻到底的问题，这就是领导人员指导和学习相结合的问题。
    突破一点，取得经验，推动全局，这是最可靠的唯物主义的方法。毛泽东同志经常教导我们进行任何工作，要坚持“首长负责，亲自动手”，“重点示范”，“从点到面”等方法。在这里的基本要求只有一个，它就是要使领导人员首先深入到一点中去，挖掘出客观事物的本质，找寻出工作中的关键和规律，从而使自己的指导方法，牢固地建立在辩证唯物主义的基础之上。这正如毛泽东同志在“实践论”中所写的：“如果要直接地认识某种或某些事物，便只有亲身参加于变革现实、变革某种或某些事物的实践的斗争中，才能触到那种或那些事物的现象，也只有在亲身参加变革现实的实践的斗争中，才能暴露那种或那些事物的本质而理解它们。”〔四〕这个“认识来源于实践”的观点，对于一个领导人员说来，并不是可有可无的，而是极端重要的。即以东北肇源县的丰产经验〔五〕为例，试问：任国栋同志如果不首先抓住四合屯这样一个个别村庄深入下去，能不能创造出推广全县甚至全东北的可贵的生产经验呢？当然是不能够的。
    个别和一般相结合的方法的另一个重要方面，就在于它可以吸引着领导人员眼睛向下，虚心地向群众学习，向下级学习。从个别的单位，具体事件，取得具体经验，进行普遍指导。在这方面毛泽东同志给我们树立了杰出的榜样。如在一九三四年，毛泽东同志总结了江西的长冈乡、福建的才溪乡两个模范乡的例子，写成了著名的“关心群众生活，注意工作方法”〔六〕的论文；又如一九四五年，毛泽东同志分析了晋察冀游击队的生产运动的经验，而写成了“游击区也能够进行生产”〔七〕的著名的社论。这些名文，在当时对于一般号召的推动力量是无比强大的，直到今天，也还是我们党的领导方法个别和一般相结合的辉煌范例。应该指出，这种方法已成为我们党的优良传统之一了。一九五一年中国纺织工会全国委员会所总结的郝建秀工作法〔八〕，和一九五二年全国总工会所推广的东北五三工厂工会工作的经验，这些著名的范例，正是这一优良传统的具体发扬。从这些例子里更可以看出领导和学习相结合的良好榜样，从而也可以看出我们党对群众的强大领导力量的真正源泉所在。
    这个问题，对于某些坐在办公室里不出门，只是钻在公文堆子里作长途旅行的一类领导人员说来，确实值得深刻的思索。
    关于领导和群众相结合的问题，毛泽东同志结合着党的整风经验，突出地阐明了斯大林同志论党的布尔什维克化的十二个条件的第九条的思想——关于建立领导核心的问题。毛泽东同志认为：在运动过程中形成一个以该单位的首要负责人为核心的少数积极分子的领导骨干，并使这一领导骨干和广大群众密切结合起来，是进行一切工作所必须遵守的方法。因之他强调指出：我们应该把斯大林同志所说的这种方法，“应用到一切大小机关、学校、部队、工厂和农村中去”。
    不能设想，群众创造自己的历史，是脱离我们党的领导而进行的；同样地也不能把我们党的联系群众和领导群众，设想成只是在群众的大海中作一种漫无边际的浪游。自流主义、尾巴主义的想法，从来为我们所反对。
    正因为是这样，建立领导核心、培养领导骨干的思想就是广大群众自己解放自己的不可缺少的基本条件，从而也就是我们领导群众斗争的基本方法之一。
    毛泽东同志指出：“任何有群众的地方，大致都有比较积极的、中间状态的和比较落后的三部分人。故领导者必须善于团结少数积极分子作为领导的骨干，并凭借这批骨干去提高中间分子，争取落后分子。”
    这种对于群众内部状态的科学分析方法，是我们坚持正确群众路线的基本出发点。群众的觉悟和我们党的觉悟是有根本差别的，而群众内部间的觉悟程度是有重大差别的，那么党又将怎样领导群众前进呢？这就必须使革命的政治家和群众的政治家互相结合。只有这个结合，才能够产生领导革命的积极性和广大群众的积极性的互相结合；而只有这个结合，才能够产生在党领导之下的有核心、有骨干、有组织的真正广大的群众运动。
    应该指出，在毛泽东同志的领导之下，这个方法也同样地成为我们党的优良传统之一了。
    试再以肇源县的丰产经验为例，任国栋同志就是运用了这个基本方法而获得成功的。他紧紧地依靠着四合屯支部书记于长江，永安村村长于万有，全国农业劳动模范王振堂这些积极分子的骨干，因而集中了群众的生产经验，创造了新耕作法；并且为了在全县范围内推广，他又紧紧地抓住了这个基本方法，训练了一万二千多名互助组长，一千多名宣传员，三万多名妇女，培养成一批强大的生产骨干。
    毛泽东同志在“必须学会做经济工作”一文中对于劳动英雄，模范工作者作过如下的指示：“你们有三种长处，起了三个作用。第一个，带头作用。这就是因为你们特别努力，有许多创造，你们的工作成了一般人的模范，提高了工作标准，引起了大家向你们学习。第二个，骨干作用。你们的大多数现在还不是干部，但是你们已经是群众中的骨干，群众中的核心，有了你们，工作就好推动了。到了将来，你们可能成为干部，你们现在是干部的后备军。第三个，桥梁作用。你们是上面的领导人员和下面的广大群众之间的桥梁，群众的意见经过你们传上来，上面的意见经过你们传下去。”〔九〕这正是对于领导骨干和广大群众相结合的方法的深刻而生动的叙述。在一九五○年九月二十五日毛泽东同志在代表中共中央向全国战斗英雄代表会议和全国工农兵劳动模范代表会议致祝词时，又强调地指出：“你们在消灭敌人的斗争中，在恢复和发展工农业生产的斗争中，克服了很多的艰难困苦，表现了极大的勇敢、智慧和积极性。你们是全中华民族的模范人物，是推动各方面人民事业胜利前进的骨干，是人民政府的可靠支柱和人民政府联系广大群众的桥梁。”〔十〕从这里就完全可以看出这个方法的重要性了。
    但是根据我们最近所接触的材料看来，在应用这个方法的时候，由于我们有些同志并没有把这样一个问题提到马克思主义的历史观的高度来认识，因而在实际工作中的偏差还是很多的。
    这种偏差经常不外两种表现形式，一种是以落后代替先进的形式，另一种是以先进代替落后的形式。
    以落后代替先进的形式最突出的例子就是我们在工会工作中某些厂矿所曾经一度犯过的经济主义、工团主义的倾向的错误。这种倾向，错误地把工人中部分落后分子的要求，当成全体工人的要求，特别是当成工人中进步分子的要求，因而不敢大胆地在工人的队伍中宣传共产党宣传共产主义。很显然地，这是违反了领导骨干和群众相结合的原则的一种右的表现；这种右的表现必然发展成为尾巴主义，其结果是丧失了培养积极分子，树立骨干的可能性，当然谈不到提高中间争取落后了。
    以先进代替落后的形式，最突出的例子就是我们在农村工作中某些地区所曾经一度犯过的盲目冒进的倾向的错误。这种倾向，错误地把农民中部分的先进分子的思想，当成了全体农民的思想，特别是当成了农民中落后分子的思想，因而在发展农业生产合作社工作中，不估计实际条件，不进行典型示范，而盲目扩大。很显然地，这是违反了领导骨干和群众相结合的原则的一种“左”的表现。这种 “左”的表现必然发展成为命令主义，其结果是孤立了积极分子，吓退了中间分子，当然更没有争取落后分子的可能了。
    毛泽东同志曾经对这两种倾向作过极深刻的批评，他说：“在一切工作中，命令主义是错误的，因为它超过群众的觉悟程度，违反了群众的自愿原则，害了急性病。……在一切工作中，尾巴主义也是错误的，因为它落后于群众的觉悟程度，违反了领导群众前进一步的原则，害了慢性病。”〔十一〕
    无论“左”或右，无论急性病或慢性病，他们的共同错误，归根到底都是由于他们的领导方法，直接违反了领导和群众相结合的原则。由于他们还缺乏深刻的马克思主义的历史观，还缺乏和马克思主义的历史观相一致的群众观点，他们就不能够准确地掌握生产发展的规律和群众运动的规律，从而正确地、有效地贯彻党的政策，使群众在党的领导之下自然而然地革命化。非“左”即右、东扶西倒的错误根源主要是在这里。
    关于领导骨干和群众相结合的问题，毛泽东同志还着重地指出如下两个原则：“凡属真正团结一致、联系群众的领导骨干，必须是从群众斗争中逐渐形成，而不是脱离群众斗争所能形成的”；“这种领导骨干的标准，应当是季米特洛夫论干部政策中所举的四条干部标准（无限忠心，联系群众，有独立工作能力，遵守纪律）”。如果违反了这些原则，就很难使真正的领导骨干形成，而且将植下脱离群众的危险种子。这就是因为这种“骨干”的形成，不是真正地从群众斗争的火焰中锻炼出来的，因之他们就不可能是群众所真正爱戴的人物。这个问题直到今天来说，还是值得我们在实际中严格掌握努力学习的。
    因此，我们的结论是：要彻底贯彻从群众中来到群众中去的群众路线的领导方法，就必须坚持个别和一般相结合，领导和群众相结合的方法。而这两者又是相辅而行，缺一不可。要真正地贯彻这个基本的方法，又必须从马克思主义认识论和历史观来加以分析。
    三、坚持一元化和坚持在一定时期内只能有一个中心工作的领导方法，是反对官僚主义、命令主义、分散主义的基本方法。
    毛泽东同志在这个文件中反复地说明了在领导方法上的几个基本问题之后，又在第七节中提出了坚持一元化的领导方法并在第八节中提出了坚持一定时期内只能有一个中心工作的问题。这对于我们今天的反对官僚主义命令主义和抵制分散主义的斗争，是具有重大的理论指导意义的。
    为了使某些领导人员从思想上彻底解决这些问题，进一步争取反对官僚主义和命令主义的重大胜利，深刻地研究一下这个第七、八两节，依然是治本办法。
    毛泽东同志在这个文件的第七节里强调指出：对于任何工作任务的向下传达，必须通过下级机关的主要负责人，使他负责，达到分工而又统一的目的，也就是要达到下级总负责人和分负责人都知道，都负责的目的。这种加强领导一元化的方法，一方面正如毛泽东同志所指出的，“这也是领导和群众相结合的一种形式”，因为总负责人可以推动和组织更多的或者是全体的人员去进行这一工作；而另一方面这恰恰是堵塞了多头领导的分散主义的祸害之门。某些不愿以党委的领导为中心而闹一些独立性或者是喜欢强调一些自己的什么“垂直系统”关系的同志，就常常是直接违反了这种领导一元化的方法。
    应该深刻认识，党的一元化的根本原则，对于党和国家的革命事业是具有严重作用的。如果在过去，容忍分散主义的发展会给党和人民以严重损失的话，那么它在我们的国家正在走向工业化的今天（工业化要求高度的集中），给予党和人民的损失，就不知更要严重得多少倍了。
    毛泽东同志在这个文件的第八节里又强调地指出：“在任何一个地区内，不能同时有许多中心工作，在一定时间内只能有一个中心工作，辅以别的第二位、第三位的工作。”很显然地，这对于反对分散主义和克服近来农村工作中的“五多”现象，是最切实不过的指示了。这一指示的根本思想，是和毛泽东同志在“矛盾论”中所阐述解决主要的矛盾的思想是完全一致的。“矛盾论”正是这样告诉我们的：在实际工作中，要抓住主要矛盾，解决主要问题。因而在一定时期内，只能有一个中心工作，而不能有许多的中心工作。放在第二位第三位的辅助工作，也只能围绕着中心工作去进行。反对平均主义，反对分散力量。这正和打仗一样，只能一个拳头打人，不能两个拳头打人。因为主攻方面只能是一个，而箝制方面，不过是为了保证和发展主攻方面的胜利而已。毛泽东同志的这个解决主要矛盾的思想，正是列宁同志的抓住特别环节的思想。列宁同志说过：“仅仅一般地做个革命家和社会主义拥护者或共产主义者，还是不够的。必须善于在每个时机里找出链条上的一个特别环节，这个环节是为了把握住整个链条并稳稳准备过渡到下一个环节所必须用全力抓住的；同时，在事变发展的历史链条里，各个环节的次序，它们的形式，它们的关连，它们彼此间的区别，都不像铁匠所制成的普通链条那样简单，那样笨拙。”〔十二〕列宁强调地指出了在革命工作中抓住链条上的特别环节问题，同时又指出了抓住这个链条的特别环节的不容易。我们知道，正是在这个意义上，毛泽东同志写道：“这是一种领导艺术。”在这个方面我们同志要虚心地学习掌握这个艺术。这是全力贯彻党和国家的中心任务而克服“五多”现象的关键所在。
    因此，我们的结论是：坚持一元化反对和抵制分散主义，坚持中心工作克服“五多”现象。这对于开展反对官僚主义、命令主义的斗争，是切实有效的。
