    Volunteer Army Soldiers' Blood Saved Her Life
    Gong Jiemin
    In the hospital ward of a field hospital of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, a Korean girl named Kim Jeong-suk, aged eighteen, and a Korean boy named Kim Gu-seok, aged fifteen, were lying quietly. They were siblings. Standing beside them was a Korean woman named Kim Yeon-suk, who was Jeong-suk and Gu-seok's older sister. Her eyes were filled with tears of gratitude as she watched the Volunteer Army nurse feeding her younger siblings water, pointed to her younger brother and sister lying on the bed, pointed to the nurse, and then pointed to her own heart, and said gratefully, "My younger sister is much better than before!"
    Kim Jeong-suk and Kim Gu-seok were injured by American planes on the morning of May 14th this year. At that time, Kim Jeong-suk was seriously injured and lay unconscious in a pool of blood. Gu-seok, who had a shoulder injury, stayed by his older sister's side and wept. They were quickly discovered by medical workers at the Volunteer Army field hospital stationed nearby and carried into the ward. Kim Jeong-suk was very pale due to excessive blood loss, her pulse was weak, and her limbs began to cool down. The situation was very dangerous. The Volunteer Army doctors decided to do their best to save Kim Jeong-suk's life and decided to give her a blood transfusion while performing the operation. Chinese Communist Party members, doctors Tong Deyuan and Li Yulin, were already prepared. They had the same blood type as Kim Jeong-suk. They calmly transfused 300 CC of fresh blood. Kim Jeong-suk's father and mother were moved to tears when they saw this great act by the Volunteer Army doctors.
    An hour later, Kim Jeong-suk woke up. She breathed a sigh of relief and slowly opened her eyes. Her father and mother happily looked at her and said, "Jeong-suk, it was the blood of the Volunteer Army comrades that made you open your eyes."
    This touching story quickly spread among the Korean people.

    志愿军战士的鲜血救活了她
    宫洁民
    中国人民志愿军某部野战收容所的病房里，安静地躺着一个十八岁的朝鲜姑娘金贞淑和一个十五岁的朝鲜男孩金九石。他们是姊弟俩。在他们的旁边站着一个名叫金莲淑的朝鲜妇女，她是贞淑和九石的姊姊。她两眼满含感激的泪水望着为她弟弟妹妹喂水的志愿军护士，指指躺在铺上的弟弟和妹妹，指了一下护士，又指了指自己的心，然后感激地说：“妹妹比以前好得多了！”
    金贞淑和金九石是在今年五月十四日的上午被美国飞机炸伤的。当时，金贞淑的伤势很重，躺在血泊里昏迷不醒。右肩负伤的九石守在姊姊身旁啼哭。他们迅速被驻在附近的志愿军野战收容所里的医务工作者们发现了，并被抬进病房里来。金贞淑由于流血过多，面色十分苍白，脉搏微弱，四肢开始冷却，情况十分危险。志愿军医生们决定要尽最大的努力挽救金贞淑的生命，在动手术的同时决定给她输血。中国共产党党员、医生佟德元和李玉林早在一旁作好准备。他们和金贞淑是同一血型。他们从容地输出了三百CC鲜血。金贞淑的父亲和母亲看见志愿军医生这种伟大的行动，感激得流下了眼泪。
    一小时以后，金贞淑苏醒过来。她长出了一口气，慢慢地睁开眼睛。她的父亲和母亲高兴地望着她说：“贞淑，是志愿军同志的热血让你睁开了眼睛。”
    这件动人的故事，很快在朝鲜人民中传开了。
