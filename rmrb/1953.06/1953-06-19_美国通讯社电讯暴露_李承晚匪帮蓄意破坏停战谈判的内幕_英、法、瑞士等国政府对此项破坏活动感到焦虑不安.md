Xinhua News Agency, June 18th: American news agency dispatches have revealed the inside story of how the US military headquarters condoned the Syngman Rhee gang of South Korea in deliberately sabotaging the agreement on the repatriation of prisoners of war.

United Press International, Tokyo, June 18th, reported that General Clark, Commander-in-Chief of the United Nations Command, "knew from Rhee Syngman himself and from the statements of the South Korean government that Rhee Syngman's first step in violating the increasingly close armistice agreement between the Allied forces and the Communists would be the release of 34,000 Korean People's Army prisoners of war who were not to be directly repatriated." However, he still allowed South Korean guards to guard the prisoner-of-war camps holding these prisoners, even though he "anticipated that this was a risky move." He did not use American troops to replace the South Korean guards to guard the prisoner-of-war camps because "he was apparently unwilling to publicly express his distrust of the South Korean government's loyalty to the Allied Command at the final stage of the armistice negotiations." This proves that the US side "knowingly" condoned the Rhee Syngman group in carrying out this "release."

Where did the 25,000 prisoners of war who were "released" go? The Associated Press, Busan, June 18th, reported, based on talks with senior South Korean military figures, that most of them would be incorporated into the South Korean army, which would allow South Korea to add almost two divisions of cannon fodder.

United Press International, Tokyo, June 18th, also reported the Syngman Rhee gang's further conspiracy to undermine the Korean armistice: "If this release of prisoners of war is not enough to hinder the realization of the armistice, Rhee Syngman may inevitably take the following steps:

一、Officially withdraw his armed forces from the Allied Command and declare that he does not abide by the armistice agreement;

二、Order the ROK army not to accept the Allied Command's order to withdraw from the demilitarized zone along the front line when the armistice is implemented;

三、Acquiesce in the armistice agreement under protest and without any legal constraints until he believes that the time is ripe militarily or politically, and then order the ROK army to launch an offensive to undermine the armistice agreement."

The UPI dispatch continued: "The Allied Command and the US government cannot control and stop Rhee Syngman from taking such actions. His army has sufficient ammunition and forward stacks of supplies to launch a short offensive to undermine the armistice. The urgent and important question of whether Rhee Syngman's actions today will undermine the realization of the armistice cannot be answered in Tokyo."

Xinhua News Agency, June 18th: The incident of the US military headquarters condoning the Syngman Rhee gang of South Korea to "release" 25,000 captured personnel of the Korean People's Army, undermining the agreement on the repatriation of prisoners of war, has aroused anxiety within the imperialist camp.

According to Agence France-Presse, London, June 18th, British Prime Minister Churchill said in the House of Commons on the afternoon of the 18th: "This is a very serious matter. This news deeply shocked me and made me very sad"; he also said that "measuring the consequences of this matter is difficult." On the same morning, British ministers had urgent contacts on this matter to study the "new crisis" it caused. Reuters reported on the same day that Britain had requested the US military headquarters in Tokyo to submit a report on the matter immediately.

Agence France-Presse, Paris, June 18th, reported: "Everyone is worried that the prospects for an armistice, which have been very promising so far, will be undermined, and all the achievements made through long and arduous negotiations will be in vain."

Switzerland, which had just recently obtained assurances from the United States that the US military headquarters had complete control over all prisoners of war in South Korea before agreeing to participate in the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, according to the Associated Press, Bern, June 18th, its Foreign Minister Petitpierre said in the Upper House that the changed situation may cause Switzerland to reconsider whether it is willing to participate in the planned Neutral Nations Repatriation and Supervisory Commissions.

    美国通讯社电讯暴露
    李承晚匪帮蓄意破坏停战谈判的内幕
    英、法、瑞士等国政府对此项破坏活动感到焦虑不安
    【新华社十八日讯】美国通讯社的电讯揭露了这次美军总部纵容南朝鲜李承晚匪帮蓄意破坏关于战俘遣返问题的协议的内幕。
    合众社东京十八日电说，联合国军总司令克拉克将军“从李承晚自己嘴里和南朝鲜政府的声明中，早就知道了李承晚违反日益逼近的联军方面和共方的停战协定的第一个步骤，将会是释放三万四千名不直接遣返的朝鲜人民军战俘”。可是，他仍然让南朝鲜卫兵看守拘留这些战俘的俘虏营，虽然他“预计到这是一种冒险行动”。他没有用美国军队来替换南朝鲜卫兵去看守战俘营，因为“他显然不愿在停战谈判的最后阶段公开表示他不信任南朝鲜政府对于联军司令部的忠诚”。这就证明了美方是“明知故犯”地纵容李承晚集团去干这种“释放”的勾当。
    这次“被释放”的二万五千名战俘到哪里去了呢？美联社十八日釜山电根据南朝鲜高级军方人士的谈话报道说，他们中间的大部分将被编进南朝鲜军队中去，这样就可以使南朝鲜差不多要增加两个师的炮灰。
    合众社东京十八日电还报道了李承晚匪帮进一步破坏朝鲜停战的阴谋说：“假如这次释放战俘事件还不足以阻碍停战的实现，李承晚还可能必然采取如次的步骤：
    一、把他的武装部队正式从联军司令部退出，并宣布他不遵守停战协定；
    二、下令韩军，在实行停战时，不接受联军司令部所发出的从沿战线上非军事区撤退的命令；
    三、在提出抗议和在法律上不受任何约束的情况下，默认停战协定，直到他认为在军事上或政治上时机成熟的时候，再下令韩军发动进攻，破坏停战协定。”
    合众社电讯继续认为：“联军司令部和美国政府是无法控制和制止李承晚采取这类行动的。他的陆军有足够的弹药和供应品的前进堆栈，来发动一次短时间的攻势，以达到破坏停战的目的。今天李承晚的行动是否会破坏停战的实现，关于这样一个急迫和重要的问题，不能在东京得到答复。” 【新华社十八日讯】美军总部纵容南朝鲜李承晚匪帮“释放”朝鲜人民军被俘人员二万五千人，破坏了关于战俘遣返问题的协议的事件，业已引起了帝国主义阵营内部的焦虑不安。
    据法新社伦敦十八日电称，英国邱吉尔首相十八日下午在下议院发表谈话称：“这是一件性质很严重的事情。这个消息使我深为震动，并大为伤心”；他并说“衡量此事的后果是困难的”。同日上午，英国各部大臣为此事曾进行紧急接触，研究它所引起的“新危机”。路透社同日电称，英国已要求东京的美军总部立即就此事提出报告。
    法新社巴黎十八日电报道称：“大家担心，到目前为止十分有望的停战前景又会被破坏，经过长期而费力的谈判所获得的一切成果会化归乌有。”
    不久以前刚从美国方面获得保证，说美军总部对在南朝鲜的一切战俘有着完全的控制，这才肯定同意参加中立国遣返委员会的瑞士，据美联社伯尔尼十八日电报道，其外交部长彼蒂彼爱在上议院说，改变了的情况可能使瑞士重新考虑是否情愿参加计划中的中立国遣返与监察两委员会。
