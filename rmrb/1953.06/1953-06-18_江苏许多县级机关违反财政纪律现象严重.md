Many County-Level Organs in Jiangsu Seriously Violate Financial Discipline

The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Finance convened a provincial financial conference in April to review the financial work of 1952. It was discovered that violations of financial discipline by county-level organs throughout the province were very serious. Many units arbitrarily used public funds, engaging in extravagance and waste. Many units expanded projects without authorization, breaking through budgets to construct projects that the country's financial resources could not currently afford and that were not actually needed. Some units still had slush funds after the "Three-Anti" campaign and were unwilling to hand them over. Taicang County was approved to build a small vegetable market each in the urban area and in Liuhe, with a total allocation of 350 million yuan. However, the county spent 412 million yuan on just the one built in the urban area. This small vegetable market can accommodate more than 3,000 people, while the total population of the urban area of Taicang is only 8,000. The Gaoyou County People's Government used 790 million yuan of local funds without approval from higher authorities to purchase furniture and movie projectors and build small guesthouses for the county cadre school. The county cadre school had only 416 employees, yet it purchased desks for 2,000 people, benches and chairs for 1,900 people, and palm and wooden beds for more than 1,000 people. The Wu County People's Government was approved to build an auditorium that could accommodate 500 to 600 people and 20 dormitory rooms, with a total allocation of 600 million yuan. However, the county built an auditorium that could accommodate 800 to 1,000 people without authorization, as well as three small conference rooms, 16 new dormitory rooms, and 20 tile-roofed houses, and renovated 40 old tile-roofed houses, exceeding the budget by more than 250 million yuan. To make up for the overspending, the county illegally used various local funds.

Many county-level organs adopted various methods to evade the bank's freeze on year-end surplus funds. For example, the Zheng County People's Government used 200 million yuan of water conservancy funds at the end of last year to build roads overnight, installing more than a dozen gasoline lamps; and used 120 million yuan to rush to buy materials for building houses. When Xinghua County People's Government cleared accounts at the end of the year, it did not hand over the surplus funds as required, but bought more than 100 leather bags, one for each cadre. In order to evade the freezing of year-end surplus funds, the Lianshui County People's Government withdrew funds for mutual aid and cooperation training from the bank in advance to purchase grain and grass for use in 1953. The Sheyang County People's Government planned to hold three meetings in 1953: armed forces, agriculture and forestry, and women. They estimated that the expenses for 1953 would be tight, so they signed and paid the money in advance on the 1952 accounts. In order to evade the freezing of year-end surplus funds, the Civil Affairs Section of the Jingjiang County People's Government privately allocated 50 million yuan of unused medical expenses for revolutionary martyrs and their families to the county hospital and falsely reported the expenses.

These situations show that many county-level leading cadres have serious localism and departmentalism, and a weak sense of the overall situation. They believe that as long as they build their own place well, "everything will be fine," so they disregard everything and undermine the financial system. They believe that handing over year-end surplus funds in accordance with the central government's regulations is a "loss" and too "pitiable." County-level financial departments have mostly adopted a laissez-faire attitude towards these serious violations of the financial system. Some county finance chiefs gave opinions to county-level leading cadres, but the leading cadres did not adopt them, so they thought: "Anyway, I gave my opinion, and I am not responsible if something goes wrong." They also did not report the violations of financial discipline to higher authorities; some finance chiefs even helped county-level leading cadres undermine the financial system.

In order to overcome the above-mentioned phenomena, the leading organs of the Jiangsu Provincial People's Government are currently not only conducting education on the overall situation and discipline for leading cadres in various counties, but also handling those with serious circumstances to educate all cadres and strictly enforce financial discipline.

    江苏许多县级机关违反财政纪律现象严重
    江苏省财政厅于四月间召开全省财政会议，对一九五二年财政工作进行了检查，发现全省各地县级机关违反财政纪律的现象很严重。许多单位任意动用公款，铺张浪费；许多单位擅自扩大工程，冲破预算来建筑一些目前国家财力所不许可的、实际上也不需要的工程；有的单位在“三反”后仍然有小金库，不肯上缴。太仓县经批准在城区和浏河各建一个小菜场，共拨款三亿五千万元，而该县仅在城区建立的一个，就用款四亿一千二百万元。这个小菜场可容三千余人，而太仓城区总人口不过八千人。高邮县人民政府未经上级批准擅自动用地方经费七亿九千万元给该县干部学校购置家具、电影机和修建小招待所等。该县干部学校仅有员工四百一十六人，却购置供二千人用的桌子、一千九百人用的凳椅、一千多人用的棕床和板床。吴县人民政府经批准建筑一个可容五百到六百人的大礼堂，建筑二十间宿舍，共拨款六亿元；该县却擅自建筑一个能容八百到一千人的大礼堂，并建筑小会议室三间、新宿舍十六间、瓦房二十间，翻修旧瓦房四十间，超支经费达两亿五千余万元。为了弥补超支，该县非法动用了地方上的各种经费。
    许多县级机关采取各种各样的方式，逃避银行对年终结余资金的冻结。如征县人民政府在去年年终时动用两亿元水利经费，架上十多盏汽灯连夜修建公路；用一亿二千万元抢购盖房的材料。兴化县人民政府年终清理时，不把结余款项按规定上缴，而买了一百多个皮包，所有干部人手一个。涟水县人民政府为了逃避年终结余资金冻结，预先将互助合作训练经费从银行提出，购买准备一九五三年用的粮草。射阳县人民政府准备在一九五三年召开武装、农林、妇女三个会议，他们估计一九五三年的经费开支很紧，于是就提前在一九五二年的账上把钱签支了。靖江县人民政府民政科为了逃避年终结余资金冻结，将未用完的烈军属医药费五千万元，私自拨给县卫生院，并假造单据报销。
    这些情况，说明了许多县级领导干部存在着严重的地方主义、本位主义思想，整体观念薄弱。他们以为只要把自己那个地方建设好就“万事大吉”了，因此就不顾一切地破坏财政制度。他们认为把年终结余资金按照中央规定上缴是“损失”，太“可惜”；而县级财政部门对这些违反财政制度的严重情况，大都采取了自由主义的态度。有的县财政科长向县级领导干部提过意见后，领导干部不采纳，他们便认为：“反正我提了意见，错了我不负责。”他们也不将违反财政纪律的情形向上级报告；有的财政科长甚至帮同县级领导干部破坏财政制度。
    江苏省人民政府领导机关为了克服上述现象，目前除对各县领导干部进行整体观念和纪律观念的教育外，并对情节严重者进行处理，以教育全体干部，严肃财政纪律。（姜其温）
