Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 14th. State-owned commercial departments in East China are actively promoting the economic accounting system. Following the pilot program in the department store system that began last December, companies in salt, coal and building materials, hardware and machinery, transportation and electrical equipment, chemical raw materials, petroleum, oils and fats, tobacco and hemp, and medicine have successively implemented the system this year. Among these companies, 530 grassroots units have been designated for independent operation with allocated capital. Currently, the respective higher-level companies have gradually devolved capital to 294 grassroots units, allowing them to begin independent operation. Simultaneously, the aforementioned companies have begun to abolish the commercial relationships previously established based on administrative divisions and are implementing new state-owned commercial networks based on economic zoning, establishing wholesale stations and stores, and conducting transactions based on contractual relationships.

Since the implementation of the economic accounting system, many new changes have emerged in the state-owned commercial departments in East China. Firstly, state-owned commercial staff have begun to change their past "supply system" operating mentality of relying on higher-level companies for money and goods and not caring about their own enterprise's profits and losses. They are now starting to operate their businesses diligently. For example, the knitted goods in Qingdao, Shandong Province, did not meet market needs in terms of specifications and designs, but the Qingdao State-Owned Department Store had not noticed this issue in the past. Since the implementation of the economic accounting system and conducting transactions based on contractual relationships, the Qingdao Department Store Wholesale Station proactively invited technicians from the factory to participate in supply meetings and listen to opinions on the products from various regions. Then, they jointly organized a specialized group to research and improve production. Now, the quality of Qingdao's knitted goods has greatly improved.

The Shanghai Purchasing and Supply Station of the China Department Store Company has been effectively improving its purchasing work. This year's summer goods can be supplied in a timely manner. For example, mosquito coils and mosquito nets were only purchased in the summer last year, resulting in "summer supplies arriving in autumn," causing a large amount of backlog. This year, the processing and production of mosquito coils started in January, now just in time for supply. A mosquito net purchaser, Zhao Meinian, said, "In the past, my work was mostly responsible for the purchasing figures, being able to buy the goods in the required quantity was enough. I rarely gave careful consideration to when they should be purchased."

In some areas, due to the mobilization of the masses of employees to conduct serious discussions on the business plan, the operating plans of the companies are now mostly practical. The coal sales plan of the Shandong Provincial Company of the China Coal and Building Materials Company was increased by 15 percent after discussion by the masses of employees. Some units have made significant improvements in their work systems. In the past, the storage system of the Yangshupu Timber Yard of the Shanghai Coal and Construction Company was very chaotic, and wood was randomly thrown into the Huangpu River. Now, the wood in this timber yard can be transported and unloaded at any time, and it is stored in separate stacks according to the type and grade, with dedicated personnel in charge.

### 华东区国营商业部门积极推行经济核算制

    华东区国营商业部门积极推行经济核算制
    【新华社上海十四日电】华东区国营商业部门积极推行经济核算制。除百货公司系统在去年十二月开始做为典型试验外，今年相继推行的还有盐业、煤业建筑器材、五金机器、交通电工器材、化工原料、石油、油脂、烟麻、医药等公司。上述各公司核定资金独立经营的基层单位共五百三十个，现各上级公司已逐步将资金下放到二百九十四个基层单位，让他们开始独立经营。同时，上述各公司已开始废除过去按行政区划建立的商业关系，而实行按经济区划建立了新的国营商业网，建立了批发站和商店，按合同关系做买卖了。
    华东区国营商业部门自推行经济核算制以来，已出现了许多新的气象。首先是国营商业工作人员已开始改变过去依赖上级公司给钱给货，自己不关心自己企业盈亏的“供给制”经营思想，开始兢兢业业经营业务了。山东省青岛市的针织品，规格花色不合市场需要，但青岛市国营百货公司过去并没有注意到这个问题。自实行经济核算制按合同关系做买卖后，青岛百货批发站就主动请工厂派技师参加供应会议，听取各地对产品的意见。然后又联合组织了专门小组，共同研究改进生产，现在青岛针织品的质量已大有提高。
    中国百货公司上海采购供应站已在有效地改进进货工作，今年的夏令货已能适时供应，如蚊香和蚊帐去年到了夏天才开始进货，结果弄成“夏季用品秋季到”，造成大量积压。今年一月份就开始了蚊香的加工生产，现在正好赶上供应。一位蚊帐的采购员赵美年说：“往年我的工作大都是对采购数字负责，能把货如数买进来就行，至于应该在什么时候买进，很少加以周密的考虑。”
    有些地区由于发动职工群众对经营计划进行了认真的讨论，目前，各公司的经营计划大都能切合实际。中国煤业建筑器材公司山东省公司煤炭的销售计划经职工群众讨论后，计划提高了百分之十五。有些单位在工作制度上有了显著改进。上海市煤建公司杨树浦木栈过去保管制度很混乱，木材随便丢在黄浦江上，现在这个木栈的木材已做到随时运到、随时起运上岸，并按材种、等级分区分垛专责保管。
