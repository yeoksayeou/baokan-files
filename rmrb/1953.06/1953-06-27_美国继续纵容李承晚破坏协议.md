Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, June 26th. Special correspondent Jiang Nan reports: Following Clark, Eisenhower's special envoy Robertson arrived in Korea yesterday and met with Syngman Rhee today.

    People are increasingly suspicious of the purpose of this series of meetings. To date, there is no indication that the United States is willing to take effective measures to remove the serious threat to the Korean armistice. On the contrary, there are increasing signs that the United States is continuing to condone Syngman Rhee's actions. After Clark's meeting with Syngman Rhee, Syngman Rhee's calls to "continue fighting" became even more rampant, but Clark vaguely stated, "That's another matter," regarding whether the armistice would be sabotaged by Syngman Rhee. He also said that he had not discussed the issue of recovering the "released" prisoners of war with Syngman Rhee at all.

    Similarly, after Robertson's meeting with Syngman Rhee, he said almost exactly the same thing that Clark had said four days earlier. He said that the meeting was conducted in a "very pleasant and friendly atmosphere." And Syngman Rhee? He said, "Mr. Robertson brought many good ideas, and our understanding of each other has been greatly improved." People do not yet know what "good ideas" he obtained from Robertson. However, according to American sources in Seoul, Dulles' letter, which Robertson handed to Syngman Rhee today, definitely guarantees that the United States will sign a "mutual defense treaty" with Syngman Rhee. It is also worth noting that the U.S. Army Chief of Staff Collins, who accompanied Robertson to Korea, immediately held meetings with South Korean and senior U.S. Army commanders on the same day, and began inspecting army equipment and the front-line situation.

    Before Robertson's meeting with Syngman Rhee had even concluded, news came from Washington that Eisenhower was also preparing to send U.S. Vice President Nixon or Dulles to meet with Syngman Rhee. Moreover, U.S. senators who attended Eisenhower's meeting at the White House on the 25th said that there was no indication that Eisenhower was demanding an armistice that did not take into account Syngman Rhee's hopes or demands. They said they learned from the meeting that American supplies were continuing to be shipped to Syngman Rhee.

    The meetings between the U.S. government and Syngman Rhee continue one after another, seemingly endlessly. In stark contrast, Panmunjom remains deserted, and the armistice negotiations have been interrupted for a week. There is still no indication when the U.S. side will give a satisfactory response to the letters from Marshal Kim Il-sung and General Peng Dehuai.

    The indignation and impatience expressed by public opinion in many Western countries in recent days is entirely justified, and they are demanding that effective action be taken against Syngman Rhee. However, the American propaganda machine is trying its best to fend off the world's condemnation of his provocative behavior. An Associated Press reporter stationed in Seoul, the mouthpiece of American warmongers, sent a telegram on the 25th saying that Churchill and other Commonwealth officials' recent remarks criticizing Syngman Rhee for sabotaging the armistice had caused Syngman Rhee's patience with the "allies" to reach a "serious limit." He also said that British criticism of Syngman Rhee was somewhat "premature." Another Associated Press reporter also issued a "warning" from the United Nations in New York on the 24th, saying that if the world continues to criticize Syngman Rhee, "it may make him more determined than before to insist on his demands."

    One can see from these words how much the U.S. government dotes on its puppet Syngman Rhee, even to the point of not allowing those "allied" countries that have sent troops to fight in Korea to condemn Syngman Rhee after he has openly taken actions to sabotage the armistice.

    Only Washington knows to what extent the U.S. government is condoning Syngman Rhee's actions to sabotage the armistice. However, every day that the armistice is delayed, not only are there more casualties among American, British, Canadian... soldiers, but there is also the danger that the armistice agreement will be completely undermined, because Syngman Rhee has already announced that he will "continue fighting" and that he will drag the "United Nations forces" into the "fire pit" with him.

### 美国继续纵容李承晚破坏协议

    美国继续纵容李承晚破坏协议
    【新华社开城二十六日电】本社特派记者江南报道：紧跟着克拉克之后，艾森豪威尔的特使罗伯逊在昨天到达朝鲜，并且在今天和李承晚进行会谈。
    人们现在越来越怀疑，这一连串会谈究竟是为了什么目的。到现在为止，还没有迹象可以证明美国愿意采取有效的措施来解除朝鲜停战所蒙受的严重威胁。相反，越来越多的迹象说明：美国方面对于李承晚正在继续采取纵容的态度。在克拉克和李承晚会谈以后，李承晚叫喊“继续打下去”更嚣张了，可是克拉克对于停战以后是否遭到李承晚的破坏，却暧昧地说“那是另外一个问题”。他还说他根本就没有和李承晚谈过关于追回被“释放”的战俘的问题。
    同样，罗伯逊在和李承晚会谈后，说的是差不多与克拉克在四天以前完全一样的话。他说：会谈是在“非常愉快而友好的气氛中”进行的。而李承晚呢？他说：“罗伯逊先生带来很多好主意，我们彼此间的谅解已在大大地改进。”人们还不知道他从罗伯逊口里得到了什么“好主意”。但据汉城的美国人士透露，罗伯逊今天交给李承晚的一封杜勒斯的信里，肯定地保证美国将和李承晚签订“共同防御条约”。还值得注意的是：和罗伯逊一起到朝鲜的美国陆军参谋长柯林斯，当天就立刻和南朝鲜的以及美国的高级陆军司令官举行会议，并且开始视察陆军设备和前线形势。
    罗伯逊和李承晚的会谈还没有结束，华盛顿方面就传出这样的消息：艾森豪威尔还准备派美国副总统尼克松或杜勒斯去和李承晚会谈。而且在二十五日参加了艾森豪威尔在白宫举行的会议的美国参议员还说，没有迹象说明艾森豪威尔要求一种不考虑到李承晚的希望或要求的停战。他们说，他们从会议上得悉，美国的供应品正在继续运给李承晚。
    美国政府和李承晚之间的会谈一个接着一个，好像没个休止。而与此成强烈对照的是，板门店依旧冷落着，停战谈判已中断一个星期了，还没有迹象表示美方什么时候才对金日成元帅和彭德怀将军的信作出满意的答复。
    西方国家的许多舆论近几天来所表现的愤激和不耐是完全有理由的，它们要求对李承晚采取有效的行动。但是，美国的宣传机器正在竭力替李承晚招架全世界对他的挑衅行为的谴责。美国好战分子的喉舌合众社驻汉城记者二十五日发出一个电报说，邱吉尔及其他英联邦官员最近斥责李承晚破坏停战的谈话，已经使李承晚对“盟国”的忍耐达到“严重的限度”。他还说英国批评李承晚的议论未免“过早”一些。合众社的另一个记者在二十四日也从纽约联合国发出“警告”说，如果全世界继续斥责李承晚，“那就可能使他比以前更决心坚持他的要求”。
    人们可以从这些话里看出，美国政府对于它的傀儡李承晚是如此宠爱，甚至在李承晚已经公开采取破坏停战的行动以后，还不许那些派有军队在朝鲜作战的“盟国”对李承晚发出谴责。
    美国政府究竟对李承晚破坏停战的行动纵容到什么地步，只有华盛顿才知道。但是，停战的一日拖延，不但美国的、英国的、加拿大的……士兵就有更多的伤亡，而且还包含着停战协定完全被破坏的危险，因为李承晚已经宣布他要“继续打下去”，他要拉着“联合国军”一齐“跳下火坑”。
