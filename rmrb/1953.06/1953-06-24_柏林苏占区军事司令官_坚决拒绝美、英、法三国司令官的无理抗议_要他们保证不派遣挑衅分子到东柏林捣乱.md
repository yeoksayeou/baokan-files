Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, June 23rd: According to TASS Berlin, June 22nd: On June 18th, the three commanders of the Western occupying sectors of Berlin sent a letter to the Soviet Berlin Control Commissioner, S.A. Dengin, regarding the incidents that occurred on the streets of the Soviet sector of Berlin on the 17th.

On the 20th, Major General Gibulova, the military commander of the Soviet sector of Berlin, delivered three letters of the same content to the US, British, and French commanders respectively, pointing out that the three Western powers' commanders had distorted the truth of the matter. Major General Gibulova stated that he firmly rejected the protests of the three commanders, as the protests were completely unfounded.

Major General Gibulova said in his letter: "The measures taken by the Soviet sector of Berlin on the 17th to extinguish the fires set and the riots incited by a group of provocateurs and fascist agents sent from the Western occupying sectors of Berlin were absolutely necessary."

Major General Gibulova pointed out that the agitators sent from West Berlin were equipped with weapons, radio communication devices, and had received special instructions. He cited as an example the interrogation record of the arrested agent Werner Karlkovsky, published on June 19th by the investigative agency of the German Democratic Republic. Werner Karlkovsky confessed that he and ninety other people were sent to the Soviet sector of Berlin to commit arson, loot shops, and create other disturbances. They were doing these things for money, hired as agents bought by foreign intelligence agencies.

Major General Gibulova said: "In view of the above and other established facts, we cannot but believe that your letter is merely an attempt by the three representatives of West Berlin to evade their responsibility for the criminal actions of hired war-mongers and instigators of out-of-control actions, and this attempt is untenable.

"Under the above circumstances, the Soviet occupying authorities cannot remain silent and allow agents from West Berlin to act arbitrarily...

"Needless to say, those who have committed arson, robbery, and other riotous crimes will be tried and severely punished."

Finally, regarding the restoration of traffic between the East and West sectors of Berlin, Major General Gibulova said: "As long as the three commanders of West Berlin take all necessary measures to ensure that provocateurs and other criminals are not sent to East Berlin, there will be no problem in restoring transportation and other traffic between the two districts of Berlin."

    柏林苏占区军事司令官
    坚决拒绝美、英、法三国司令官的无理抗议
    要他们保证不派遣挑衅分子到东柏林捣乱
    【新华社二十三日讯】据塔斯社柏林二十二日讯：六月十八日，柏林西方国家占领区的三个司令官曾致函苏联驻柏林管制专员谢·阿·詹根，谈到十七日在柏林苏联占领区街道上发生的事件。
    二十日，柏林苏联占领区军事司令官吉布洛伐少将以同样内容的信件三封分别交给美、英、法司令官，指出西方三国司令官歪曲事情的真相。吉布洛伐少将表示，坚决拒绝三国司令官的抗议，因为抗议是完全没有理由的。
    吉布洛伐少将在信中说：“为扑灭从柏林西方国家占领区派过来的一群挑衅分子和法西斯特务所放的火和煽动的骚乱，柏林苏联占领区在十七日所采取的措施是绝对必要的。”
    吉布洛伐少将指出：从西柏林派过来的煽动骚乱的人装备有武装、无线电通话机，并曾接受特别指示。他举出德意志民主共和国政府调查机构六月十九日公布的对被逮捕的特务维尔纳·卡尔科夫斯基的审讯记录作为例证。维尔纳·卡尔科夫斯基供认他与其他九十个人一同被派到柏林苏占区来纵火、抢劫商店并制造其它骚乱。他们是为了钱，受雇作为外国谍报机关所收买的特务做这些事的。
    吉布洛伐少将说：“鉴于以上所述以及其它已确立的事实，我们不能不认为你的信件只是企图为西柏林的三国代表推卸他们对雇佣的战争挑拨者和煽动轨外行动的人的罪恶行动所负的责任，而这种企图是立不住脚的。
    “在上述情况下，苏联占领当局不能无所表示，而听任西柏林派来的特务恣意活动……。
    “不用说，那些犯有纵火、抢劫和其它暴乱罪行的人将受审讯，并受严惩。”
    吉布洛伐少将最后就恢复柏林东西区之间交通的问题说：“只要西柏林的三国司令官采取一切必要措施来保证不派遣挑拨分子和其他罪恶分子到东柏林来，柏林两区之间运输和其它交通的恢复是没有什么问题的。”
