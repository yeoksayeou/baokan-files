Guangdong faces the South China Sea in the east and borders the Gulf of Tonkin in the south. The water temperature is suitable, the sea surface is vast, and there are numerous kinds of fish. The fishing grounds cover an area of over 100,000 square li. Fish ponds are densely distributed in the Pearl River Delta, making it one of China's important aquatic product areas.

Since the abolition of the feudal exploitation system of fish markets—exclusive buying and selling rights—in 1950, the production enthusiasm of fishermen has increased. Fish merchants and vendors also feel that business is more convenient. As a result, fish production has increased, and fish products sell well.

However, the recovery of Guangdong's fisheries production has been very slow. Taking the statistics of fourteen fishing ports from April to October 1952 as an example, the total output only exceeded the pre-liberation output by 10 percent, and was only 45.14 percent of the pre-War of Resistance against Japan output. The unit output of fishing boats has also not returned to pre-war levels. The output of Huang Xiuhui's large trawl wind boat in Shaba Port has been at a mid-to-upper level in previous years. The output in 1948 was 1,440 piculs (per pair of boats), which dropped to 1,300 piculs in 1952. Ordinary boats can only produce 800 to 900 piculs. Before the war, the maximum output of a pair of large trawlers could reach 2,000 to 2,400 piculs, and the average was 1,600 to 1,700 piculs. Among the fifty-two large trawl wind boats in the port, only fourteen could maintain production in 1952, and the rest all suffered losses. There was also an abnormal phenomenon in the recovery of the number of fishing boats, that is, the recovery of small boats with an annual output of less than 50 piculs was rapid, while the medium and large boats with an annual output of about 500 piculs still had difficulties.

There are many reasons for the slow recovery of Guangdong's fisheries. One of the main reasons is that the Guangdong Aquatic Products Bureau and Aquatic Products Company have not conscientiously implemented the Party and government's fisheries production policy. The Aquatic Products Bureau and Aquatic Products Company were established in 1950. At that time, the leaders of aquatic products work believed that implementing the Party and government's policy of vigorously restoring mass fisheries production, strengthening fishermen's organizations, and guiding them towards cooperative economy meant only abolishing the exclusive buying and selling rights of fish markets and ensuring that fish prices were higher than before the establishment of markets. However, they lacked sufficient understanding of the actual situation that fishermen had suffered feudal exploitation for generations, were seriously injured, and had many production difficulties. On the other hand, they did not proceed from the country's current economic strength and blindly imagined vigorously developing modern enterprises. Under the control of this wrong thinking, they made many mistakes in market management, prices, and other aspects.

First of all, they did not grasp the price policy well. The task of the fish market was originally to control fish prices and adjust production and sales to protect the interests of both producers and consumers. Although fish prices in the market have often been higher than before the establishment of the market in the past three years, they have been very chaotic. The most prominent problem is the huge difference in regional prices, and the prices in the same market fluctuate greatly, even changing greatly within a day. For example, in February of this year, the Jieshi promotion station purchased golden threadfin bream at a price of 150,000 yuan per picul, while the price in Guangzhou was 400,000 yuan per picul. For example, the fishermen of Leidong once caught 30,000 catties of fish on the first day. The promotion station purchased it at a price of 160,000 yuan per picul. The next day, they caught 100,000 catties, and the promotion station lowered the price to 150,000 yuan per picul. On the third day, they caught 200,000 catties, and the promotion station was only willing to pay 120,000 yuan. The fresh fish price list in Xiangzhou Port is divided into morning, noon, and evening, and the difference is very large. As a result, fishermen pay for water and transportation at their own expense in order to catch up with fish prices, and even give up some production time to transport fish to Guangzhou for sale. In this case, there is a shortage of fish in this port and a congestion of fish in that port. The people in the producing area eat expensive fish, while private merchants take the opportunity to seize huge profits. The leaders of aquatic products work not only do not pay attention to these situations, but instead pursue the free market and abandon the responsibility of leading the market through reasonable prices. In the management of the fish market, there are also many violations of policies. The leaders of aquatic products work, based on the wrong policy of "administrative support for the company, everything should be beneficial to the company," limit the quota of distribution and sales or buy and sell in rotation in the fish market, restrict fish merchants and vendors from having more than one million yuan in funds (Wanzai Port in Zhongshan County once limited it to 500,000 yuan), and restrict fish merchants from acquiring fish in other markets. In August of last year, there was even a phenomenon of restricting private merchants from buying from afar, and the company took over the fish. Under this wrong market management, the Sanya Port promotion station in Hainan once "packaged" all the fish, allocating two or three piculs to fish merchants a day, and sometimes not even once a week. On the other hand, the company only collects big fish and not small fish, and collects fish but not shrimp and crabs, so that the fishermen's catches are either dumped into the sea because they have deteriorated, or private merchants take the opportunity to force down the price to purchase them.

Fishermen's supplies are related to the output and cost of fisheries production, and also to the fishermen's income. The Aquatic Products Company should supply fishermen's supplies both in a timely manner and try to reduce costs as much as possible. This is the correct policy to support fishermen's production. However, last year, the profit from the supply of fishermen's supplies accounted for the largest proportion of the Aquatic Products Company's net profit. These profits are all derived from raising the prices of fishermen's supplies. Last year, the Shanwei promotion station collected more than 80 piculs of fishing nets at a price of 17,000 to 20,000 yuan per catty, but resold them to fishermen at 24,000 yuan per catty, with an interest rate as high as 20 to 40 percent. For example, the Aquatic Products Company collected sculling oars from private merchants in Jiangmen at a price of 110,000 yuan, transported them to Guanghai and sold them to fishermen for 170,000 to 180,000 yuan, and transported them to Shadi for 220,000 yuan. Not only that, the Aquatic Products Company does not supply the most needed fishing salt, wood and matting, sculling oars, etc. in a timely manner, or simply does not supply them, or supplies inferior goods, so that fishermen suffer losses such as fish deterioration, reduced output, or wasted production time in order to buy fishermen's supplies. Last year, the "Hengdeli" fishing boat in Bohai Port caught 600 to 700 piculs of fish and returned, requesting the promotion station to lend them fishing salt. The promotion station did not take care of the fishermen's difficulties and did not lend it to them. When the fishermen borrowed money to buy salt, it had been a day, and the price of fish was reduced by 30,000 yuan per picul, for a total loss of 21 million yuan. The promotion station in Shanwei Port only prepared red mats (used as sails) for shallow seas, and did not prepare mats for deep seas. As a result, fishermen can only use them for three months (if they are mats for deep seas, they can be used for one year), and it affects fishing boats going to deep seas to fish. The sculling oars supplied by the Aquatic Products Company (manufactured by the Shanwei Company's sculling oar factory) are of poor quality (generally can be used for 120 days, but the sculling oars supplied by the Aquatic Products Company can only be used for 60 days). The fishermen do not know this, so that in fishing, one boat's oar breaks (two boats are used to tow and catch with nets), and the other boat's oar must be cut off. Otherwise, because the fishing net is too heavy, there is a danger of sinking the boat; but once the oar is cut off, all the fish that have been caught will be lost.

The Party and the government care about the suffering of fishermen and stipulate that market management fees can only solve the needs of market equipment, fishermen's welfare, and management personnel's living expenses. In the past three years, the Aquatic Products Bureau has collected 21.6 billion yuan in management fees. Except for using more than 13 billion yuan to build the market, not a penny has been used for fishermen's welfare. It is difficult for fishing boats to save themselves when they encounter danger at sea, but the leaders of the Aquatic Products Bureau never consider building electric boats to rescue fishing boats and fishermen, or setting up buoys or lighthouses to avoid accidents; instead, they devote all their efforts to spending more than 4 billion yuan of management fees to build four "most modern in the country" fishing boats. As a result, fishermen often have to take risks. In the Aquatic Products Bureau's work summary report for 1952, there is not a word about what has been done in the past in terms of welfare and ensuring production safety, and how to do it in the future.

The government has stipulated that the market management fee is generally 1 to 3 percent, and should be gradually reduced. However, the Aquatic Products Bureau has been collecting a management fee of 4 percent for the past three years.

The mistakes of the Aquatic Products Bureau and the Aquatic Products Company are due to the lack of production perspective, mass perspective, and blind and rash advance thinking of the leading cadres of aquatic products work. In this struggle against bureaucracy, the leading cadres of aquatic products work must, with the help of the local Party committee and higher authorities, conscientiously examine their work, deeply explore their mistakes, and carry out criticism in order to improve their work.

### 广东水产部门缺乏生产观点漠视渔民利益

    广东水产部门缺乏生产观点漠视渔民利益
    广东东迎南海，南接东京湾，水温适宜，洋面辽阔，鱼类繁多，鱼场面积逾十万方里；珠江三角洲上鱼塘密布，是我国重要水产地之一。
    自一九五零年取消了鱼栏的封建剥削制度——专买专卖权以后，渔民生产积极性提高，正当鱼商鱼贩也感到经营方便，因此，鱼产增加，鱼货畅销。
    但广东渔业生产的恢复是很缓慢的。以一九五二年四月到十月间十四个渔港的统计为例，总产量仅超过解放前产量的百分之十，为抗日战争前产量的百分之四十五点一四。鱼船的单位产量亦未恢复到战前水平。沙扒港黄秀辉的大拖风船的产量，历年都在中上水平，一九四八年的产量为一千四百四十市担（一对船），一九五二年降到一千三百市担。一般的船则只能生产八、九百市担。而在战前，一对大拖船最高产量可达二千到二千四百担，一般的也达一千六、七百担。该港的五十二艘大拖风船中，一九五二年能维持生产的仅十四艘，其余的全要亏本。在鱼船数量的恢复上也出现了不正常的现象，即年产量不足五十担的小船恢复迅速，而年产量五百担左右的中、大船仍有困难。
    广东渔业恢复缓慢的原因很多，其中主要原因之
    一，是广东水产局、水产公司没有认真地贯彻党和政府的渔业生产政策。水产局和水产公司于一九五零年成立，当时水产工作领导方面认为贯彻党和政府的大力恢复群众性的渔业生产，加强渔民组织，引导他们走向合作经济的方针，就只是取缔鱼栏的专买专卖权，保证鱼价高出设立市场以前的水平，但对渔民世代遭受封建剥削，元气大伤，生产困难很多的实际情况认识不足；另一方面，他们又不从国家当前的经济力量出发，盲目地幻想大力发展现代化企业。在这种错误思想的支配下，他们便在市场管理、价格等方面发生了很多错误。
    首先，他们没有很好地掌握价格政策。鱼市场的任务原是掌握鱼价、调剂产销以保障生产与消费者的利益。三年来市场上的鱼价虽然经常高于设立市场前的水平，但是非常混乱，最突出的是地区差价悬殊、同一市场内的价格又起伏不定，甚至一日之内价格变化也很大。如今年二月，碣石推销站以十五万元一担的价格收购金鲮鱼，而广州市价为四十万元一担。又如雷东的渔民有一次第一天捕鱼三万斤，推销站以每担十六万元的价格收进，次日捕得十万斤，推销站便降价到每担十五万元，第三天捕得二十万斤，推销站只肯出十二万元。香州港的鲜鱼牌价有早、午、晚之分，而且差幅很大。结果渔民为了赶鱼价，自己出钱请带水、出运费，甚至放弃
    一部分生产时间，把鱼货运到广州出售。在这种情况下，就出现了此港鱼货很缺，那港鱼货拥塞，产区人民吃贵鱼，而私商却趁机攫取暴利的现象。水产工作的领导者对这些情况不特不加重视，反而追逐自由市场，放弃通过合理价格来领导市场的责任。在鱼市场的管理上，也有很多违反政策的地方。水产工作领导方面，根据“行政支持公司，一切要使公司有利”的错误方针，在鱼市场上限额配销配售或轮买轮卖，限制鱼商、鱼贩资金不得超过一百万元（中山县湾仔港曾一度限制为五十万元），并限制鱼商不得到其他市场收购。到去年八月更出现了限制私商远购，公司把鱼货包下来的现象。在这种错误的市场管理下，海南三亚港推销站曾把鱼货全部“包起来”，一天配给鱼商二、三担，有时一星期也不配给一次。而另一方面，公司却只收大鱼不收小鱼，收鱼不收虾蟹，致使渔民的渔获物或因变坏而倾倒下海，或被私商乘机压价收购。
    渔需品关系着渔业生产的产量和成本，也关系着渔民的收益。水产公司供应渔需品应该是既要及时，又要尽量降低成本，这才是扶助渔民生产的正确方针。可是去年水产公司的纯利中，以供应渔需品的利润所占的比重最大。这些利润都是从高抬渔需品价格而得来的。去年汕尾推销站以一万七千元到二万元一斤的价格收了八十多担鱼网，转手间却以每斤二万四千元卖给渔民，利率高达百分之二十到百分之四十。又如水产公司以十一万元的价格在江门向私商收入笏揽，运到广海卖给渔民却要十七、八万元，运到沙堤要二十二万元。不但如此，水产公司对生产上最需要的渔盐，木料及?蓆、笏揽等，不是供应不及时，就是干脆不供应，或者是供应次货，这样就使渔民受到鱼货变坏、产量减少或为了买渔需品而浪费生产时间等损失。去年博贺港“亨得利”号鱼船捕得六、七百担鱼回来，要求推销站贷给渔盐，推销站却不照顾渔民困难，不予贷给，待渔民借到钱来买盐时，已隔一天，鱼价每担降低了三万元，共损失了二千一百万元。汕尾港的推销站只准备了浅海用的红席（作船帆用），没有准备深海用的席，结果渔民买来只能用三个月
    （如系深海用的席可用一年），并且影响鱼船到深海打鱼。水产公司供应的笏揽（由汕尾公司的笏揽厂制造）质量次（一般可用一百二十天，水产公司供应的只能用六十天），渔民不知道，以致在捕鱼中一船揽断了（系用两船系网拖捕），便须把另一船的揽斩断，否则因鱼网过重，有沉船的危险；但一斩断了揽，已捕得的鱼就要全部损失了。
    党和政府关怀着渔民疾苦，规定了市场管理费只能解决市场设备、渔民福利及管理人员生活开支的需要。三年来水产局征收了二一六亿元的管理费，除了以一百三十余亿元用来建设市场外，分文未用到渔民福利上来。鱼船出海遇险即难以自救，可是水产局领导方面从不考虑造电船以抢救鱼船和渔民，设浮标或灯塔以避免事故；反而倾全力拿管理费中的四十余亿元建造四条“全国最新式”的鱼船。结果渔民经常要冒风险。水产局一九五二年的工作总结汇报中，无片言只字谈到过去在福利和保障生产安全上做了些什么，以及今后怎样做。
    政府曾规定市场管理费一般为百分之一到百分之三，并应逐步减少。可是水产局三年来一直征收管理费百分之四。
    水产局及水产公司的错误，是由于水产工作的领导干部缺乏生产观点、群众观点和盲目冒进的思想造成的。在这次反官僚主义的斗争中，水产工作的领导干部，必须在当地党委和上级机关的帮助下，认真地检查工作，深入发掘错误，进行批判，以改进工作。（本报广东记者站黄炳辉）
