Xinhua News Agency, July 7th News from Tokyo: To welcome the convocation of the World Women's Congress, more than 400 women representatives from all over Japan held the Japanese Women's Congress in Tokyo on May 23.

The various colorful flags and slogans hanging in the venue reflected the urgent demands of Japanese women. These flags and slogans were embroidered or written with: "Oppose Land Expropriation," "We Want to Establish a Country Without Military Bases," "We Want to Establish a Society Where Men, Women, Young and Old Can Have a Good Life," etc.

The conference heard reports from women representatives from various regions. They denounced the suffering of Japanese women under the US occupation, demanding the defense of women's rights and happiness, the removal of US military bases, and the defense of peace. These accusations and demands of Japanese women will be brought to the World Women's Congress. The women's representative from Nagano Prefecture reported on the struggle of the people of Nagano Prefecture against militarization at the Japanese Women's Congress, saying: After the US military proposed taking over Mount Asama as a training ground, the people of Nagano Prefecture launched a fierce opposition movement. They stated: "We will not allow cultural and scenic areas to be turned into areas filled with flying shells and prostitutes," "We will not allow a second Mount Fuji foothills to appear." The women's representative from Hokkaido said: The people of Hokkaido are opposing military bases and are carrying out a struggle to defend peace. Women living in military bases and in difficult fishing villages and rural areas, as well as female coal miners at the Yutani Coal Mine who are carrying out an indefinite strike, wrote more than 500 letters to the Copenhagen World Women's Congress. In addition, women representatives from Miyagi Prefecture, Hyogo Prefecture, and Kanagawa Prefecture also reported on the great efforts made by Japanese women in opposing the establishment of military bases, striving for peace, and supporting the World Women's Congress.

The conference received a congratulatory telegram from the All-China Democratic Women's Federation.

Representatives from the Japanese Communist Party and the Labor-Farmer Party delivered congratulatory speeches at the meeting. Nakahara Kenji of the Labor-Farmer Party said at the conference: The US-Japan "Administrative Agreement," which allows the US military to act as it pleases, proves that Japan's so-called "independence" is a complete lie. If this "Administrative Agreement" is not revoked and the rule of the Liberal Party government is not overthrown, Japan's independence is not guaranteed. Finally, Nosaka Ryu, representing the Communist Party, spoke: "Peace can definitely be defended. If everyone takes courage and stands at the forefront, peace can definitely be defended."

    迎接世界妇女大会的日本妇女大会在东京举行
    日本妇女要求撤除美国军事基地保卫和平
    【新华社七日讯】东京迟到消息：为了迎接世界妇女大会的召开，日本全国各地推出的妇女代表四百多人曾在五月二十三日在东京举行日本妇女大会。
    会场中悬挂的各式各样的彩旗和标语的内容，反映着日本妇女的迫切要求。这些彩旗和标语绣着或写着：“反对征用土地”、“我们要建立没有军事基地的国家”、“我们要建立男女老少都能有好的生活的社会”等。
    大会听取了各地妇女代表的报告。她们纷纷控诉日本妇女在美国占领下的痛苦，要求保卫妇女权利和幸福，撤除美国军事基地，保卫和平。日本妇女的这些控诉和要求，将要带到世界妇女大会中去。长野县妇女代表在日本妇女大会上报告长野县人民反对军事基地化的斗争说：美军提出接管浅间山为演习场的要求以后，长野县全县人民发动了猛烈的反对运动。他们表示：“不许把文化区和名胜区变成炮弹横飞、妓女充斥的地区”，“不许出现第二个富士山麓”。北海道妇女代表说：北海道的人民反对军事基地，正进行着保卫和平的斗争。过着军事基地生活和困苦的渔村和农村生活的妇女们，以及实行无限期罢工斗争的油谷煤矿女工们，写了五百多封信给哥本哈根世界妇女大会。此外，宫城县，兵库县和神奈川县等地妇女代表，也都报告了各地日本妇女在反对建立军事基地、争取和平、拥护世界妇女大会方面作了很大努力。
    大会收到了中华全国民主妇女联合会的贺电。
    日本共产党和劳农党的代表在会上致贺词。劳农党的中原健次在大会上说：允许美国军队为所欲为的美日“行政协定”，证明日本的所谓“独立”是彻底的谎言，如果不撤销这个“行政协定”，不推翻自由党政府的统治，日本的独立是没有保障的。最后，野坂龙代表共产党发言说：“和平是一定能够保卫的。每一个人都拿出勇气，站在前列，就一定能保卫和平。”
