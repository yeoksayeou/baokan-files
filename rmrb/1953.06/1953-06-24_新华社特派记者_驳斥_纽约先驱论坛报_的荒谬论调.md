Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, June 23rd: (Xinhua News Agency Special Correspondent Jiang Nan reports:) Whether the US side has any sincerity regarding the Korean armistice is now being severely tested by how they handle the issue of the Syngman Rhee gang forcibly detaining prisoners of war. However, the American "New York Herald Tribune" actually stated in its editorial on the 19th that the attitude taken by the Korean and Chinese side towards Syngman Rhee's provocations will be a "very sharp test of whether the Korean and Chinese side are eager for an armistice."

The "New York Herald Tribune" putting forward such an absurd argument that reverses right and wrong is not accidental. The Syngman Rhee gang's destructive actions at the last moment before the realization of the Korean armistice, which the whole world yearns for, have aroused great indignation worldwide. The world has also severely criticized the US side for deliberately condoning Syngman Rhee's sabotage of the armistice. The author of the "New York Herald Tribune" editorial was clearly ordered to undertake a dishonorable task: to try to shift the world's attention from the US side to the Korean and Chinese side, and to try to remove the responsibility for obstructing the armistice from the US side and push it onto the Korean and Chinese side.

Unfortunately, this author, like his wire-puller, overestimated his capabilities.

The author of the "New York Herald Tribune" editorial cannot deny that all fair-minded public opinion has praised the attitude taken by the Korean and Chinese side regarding the progress of negotiations in the past two months. The author of the editorial is not unaware that the negotiations, which were unilaterally interrupted by the US side, were resumed on the basis of the suggestion of the Korean and Chinese side, and it was on the basis of this suggestion that the issue of prisoners of war, which had been delayed for more than a year and a half, was finally agreed upon. The day Syngman Rhee coerced the detention of prisoners of war was exactly when signs at Panmunjom indicated that an agreement had been reached on the issue of the military demarcation line, and administrative details concerning the signing of the armistice agreement were nearing completion. In such circumstances, the one who should be tested for sincerity is, of course, the US side, which claims to be able to control the Syngman Rhee government and army, and certainly not the Korean and Chinese side.

People have every reason to question the author of the "New York Herald Tribune" editorial: Were the 26,700 North Korean prisoners of war who were not directly repatriated "released" by the Korean and Chinese side? Did the Korean and Chinese side violate the agreement on the repatriation of prisoners of war? Is Syngman Rhee controlled by the Korean and Chinese side? Did the incident occur within the area controlled by the Korean and Chinese side? Unfortunately, even if this gentleman has the greatest ability in the world, he cannot move Busan to North Korea, put the Syngman Rhee group under the control of the Korean and Chinese side, or say that the act of "releasing" prisoners of war was done by the Korean and Chinese side.

The matter could not be clearer. Since the incident of "releasing" prisoners of war occurred in the US-controlled POW camps in South Korea, was done by America's "friend" Syngman Rhee, and was done with the "sympathy" of some people on the American side, then isn't the handling of this incident a test of the US side's sincerity?

The US side cannot escape this test, just as the author of the "New York Herald Tribune" editorial cannot escape his own conclusion. This gentleman said in his article: "Taking a firm attitude towards the Syngman Rhee government can overcome the obstacles that this government has placed in the path of the armistice."

### 新华社特派记者  驳斥“纽约先驱论坛报”的荒谬论调

    驳斥“纽约先驱论坛报”的荒谬论调
    【新华社开城二十三日电】本社特派记者江南报道：美方对于朝鲜停战究竟有无诚意，现在正在他们如何处理李承晚匪帮强迫扣留战俘的问题上受到严重的考验。可是美国的“纽约先驱论坛报”却竟然在它十九日的社论里说，朝中方面对于李承晚的挑衅行为所采取的态度，将是对于朝中方面“是否渴望停战的非常尖锐的考验”。
    “纽约先驱论坛报”提出这么一个颠倒是非的荒谬论点，并不是偶然的。李承晚匪帮在举世渴望的朝鲜停战实现之前的最后一刻所采取的破坏行动，已经引起了全世界的极大愤慨。全世界对于美方故意地纵容李承晚破坏停战，也提出了严厉的责难。“纽约先驱论坛报”社论的作者显然是受命担当一个不名誉的任务：企图把全世界的视线从美方转移到朝中方面来，并且企图把阻挠停战的责任从美方身上卸下而把它推到朝中方面身上。
    可惜得很，这位作者和他的牵线人一样，是太不量力了。
    “纽约先驱论坛报”社论作者无论如何总不能否认对于最近两个月来谈判的进展，所有公正舆论都赞扬朝中方面所采取的态度。社论的作者不是不知道，被美方片面中断的谈判是在朝中方面建议的基础上恢复的，正是在这个建议的基础上，拖延了一年半以上的战俘问题才最后取得了协议。在李承晚胁迫扣留战俘的行动开始那一天，正好是板门店的种种迹象显示关于军事分界线的问题已经取得协议、有关签订停战协定的行政细节接近完成的时候，在这样的时候发生了这样的事件，应该受到诚意的考验的当然就是自称能够控制李承晚政府和军队的美国方面，而绝不可能是朝中方面的。
    人们完全有理由质问“纽约先驱论坛报”社论的作者：那二万六七千的不直接遣返的北朝鲜战俘是朝中方面“释放”的吗？是朝中方面破坏了关于战俘遣返问题的协议吗？李承晚是受朝中方面控制的吗？事件是发生在朝中方面控制的地区之内吗？可惜得很，这位先生纵然有天大的本领，也无法把釜山搬到北朝鲜，把李承晚集团放到朝中方面控制之下，把“释放”战俘的行为说成是朝中方面干的。
    事情再清楚也没有了。既然“释放”战俘的事件是在南朝鲜的美方控制的战俘营里发生的，是美国的“朋友”李承晚干的，而且是得到美国方面某些人的“同情”的，那末，对于这个事件的处理，不是对于美方有无诚意的考验是什么？
    美方不能逃避这个考验，就像“纽约先驱论坛报”的社论作者不能逃避他自己的结论一样。这位先生在他的文章里说：“对李承晚政府采取坚定的态度是能够克服这个政府所放到停战道路上来的障碍的。”
