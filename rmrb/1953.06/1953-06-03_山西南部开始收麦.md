Southern Shanxi Province has begun harvesting wheat. Yongji and Yuxiang counties, which started harvesting earlier, have now mostly completed the harvest, and farmers are enthusiastically selling new wheat. Farmers in Wenxi, Xiaxian, Jiexian, Hongtong and other counties are actively preparing for the wheat harvest and will begin harvesting in a few days. The Department of Agriculture of the Shanxi Provincial People's Government has sent two work teams to the Yuncheng and Linfen regions to promote wheat field selection, summarize the masses' experience in combating disasters and protecting wheat, and prepare for increased wheat production next year. The Yuncheng Prefectural Commissioner's Office and the counties of Jiexian, Xiaxian, Yongji, and Hongtong have all issued instructions on protecting wheat and ensuring the autumn harvest, requiring all localities to complete the preparation work for protecting and harvesting wheat in a timely manner, and to quickly harvest and store the wheat as soon as it ripens to prevent losses due to wind and rain. Yongji County convened cadres from sixteen villages including Taoli and Nanjieyi to study and arrange the work of mobilizing farmers to carry out wheat comparisons. (Xinhua News Agency)

    山西南部开始收麦
    山西省南部地区已开始收割小麦。开镰较早的永济、虞乡等县，现在已大部收割完毕，农民正踊跃出售新麦。闻喜、夏县、解县、洪洞等县农民正积极进行麦收准备工作，不日即可开割。山西省人民政府农业厅派出两个工作组，深入运城、临汾两专区推动麦田选种，总结群众抗灾保麦经验，为来年小麦增产作准备。运城专署和解县、夏县、永济、洪洞等县都已发出护麦保秋指示，要求各地及时完成护麦和收麦的准备工作，麦子一熟就迅速收割保管，以防因风雨遭致损失。永济县曾召集桃李、南节义等十六个村的干部研究和布置了发动农民进行小麦评比的工作。（新华社）
