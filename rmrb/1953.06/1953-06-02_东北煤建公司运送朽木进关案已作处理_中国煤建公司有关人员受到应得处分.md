According to a letter from the Central Ministry of Commerce: The case of the Northeast Coal Construction Company violating the contract by transporting rotten wood into customs under the guise of good wood, and the North China Tianjin and other branch companies using bad wood mixed with good wood for sale, deceiving the cargo using departments, has been thoroughly investigated by the Supreme People's Procuratorate in conjunction with the Central Ministry of Commerce. This case illustrates the serious departmentalism and speculative thinking existing in both the Northeast Coal Construction Company and the Tianjin and other coal construction companies. The China Coal Construction Company has serious bureaucratic work style (for details of this case, see page 2 of this newspaper on February 22). The illegal and derelict personnel who caused this incident should be subject to disciplinary action. In addition to considering the leaders of the Northeast Coal Construction Company as the main responsible parties for causing this incident, and should be subject to heavier disciplinary action, and the Tianjin Coal Construction Company as the unit with the most egregious style in selling bad wood in North China, and should be subject to disciplinary action, and has notified the Northeast and North China Commercial Bureaus to consult with local supervisory authorities for discussion, the Central Ministry of Commerce has given the following punishments for the bureaucratic errors of the China Coal Construction Company:

　　Li Nansheng, Manager of China Coal Construction Company, signed the contract for Northeast wood entering customs, but did not understand the content of the contract well, and blindly trusted Jin Yongjie. In the early stage of the rotten wood entering customs, he did not make timely inspection and effective prevention. In promoting off-grade materials, he only made general instructions, and did not conduct in-depth organization, investigation, and research to summarize the experience. At the beginning of the anti-bureaucracy struggle in the agency, he did not review this incident until the masses raised their opinions, and then he conducted a review; however, his attitude was sincere in the final review. In view of the responsibilities that Comrade Li Nansheng should bear in leadership, he is given a warning.

　　Fan Juqiu, Deputy Manager of China Coal Construction Company, directly led the work of the Equipment and Materials Department, and was the main person in charge of wood business. After the rotten wood entered customs, he did not pay attention to it, but only ordered the Equipment and Materials Department to check and solve it, and did not take effective measures to prevent it. He did not carefully check the implementation of the contract, and did not check and prevent the bad work style of Tianjin and other coal construction companies in raising the grade and selling bad wood. This shows that Comrade Fan Juqiu has taken an irresponsible attitude towards his work, and should be given a demerit.

　　Jin Liansan was the former Director of the Business Department of China Coal Construction Company (transferred from the company in August 1952), directly leading the Equipment and Materials Department. Comrade Jin Liansan participated in and signed every meeting and document approval from the signing of the contract to the inspection and implementation of the Northeast wood entering customs. However, he adopted a seriously irresponsible attitude, and did not actively try to solve the serious incident of a large amount of rotten wood entering customs, but pushed it to the Wood Department, resulting in huge losses, and should be given a demerit.

　　Jin Yongjie, Chief of the Equipment and Materials Department of China Coal Construction Company, directly handled the work of Northeast wood entering customs. However, he showed a seriously irresponsible attitude in his work. He did not actively try to solve the serious incident of Northeast transporting rotten wood into customs, and did not timely propose methods and requests for handling to the leadership. He only wrote "Save for Reference," "Handle Together," and "Archive" on the reports from various places. His attitude in the review was also insincere and unrepentant, emphasizing objective difficulties and attempting to shirk responsibility. In view of Comrade Jin Yongjie's seriously irresponsible attitude and his unrepentant attitude towards correcting mistakes, he should be given a major demerit.

    东北煤建公司运送朽木进关案已作处理
    中国煤建公司有关人员受到应得处分
    据中央商业部来信：东北煤建公司违反合同以腐朽木材冒充好木材运进关内，华北天津等地分支公司用坏木材掺入好木材出售，欺骗用货部门一案，业经最高人民检察署会同中央商业部调查清楚。此案说明了东北煤建公司和天津等地的煤建公司都存在着严重的本位主义思想与投机取巧思想，中国煤建公司存在着严重的官僚主义作风（此案详情见二月二十二日本报第二版）。造成这一事件的违法失职人员，应受到纪律处分。中央商业部除认为东北煤建公司的领导人为造成这次事件的主要负责者，应受到较重的纪律处分，天津煤建公司为华北出售坏木材中作风最为恶劣的单位，应受到纪律处分，并已通知东北、华北商业局商请当地监察机关加以议处外，对中国煤建公司的官僚主义错误已予以下列处分：
    中国煤建公司经理李南生签订了东北进关木材合同，但并不大了解合同内容，盲目信任靳勇杰，在运送腐朽木材进关事件发生初期，未作及时检查与有效制止。在推销等外材上，只作了一般指示，而未深入组织调查研究，总结其中经验。在机关反官僚主义斗争开始时，并未对此事件进行检讨，直到群众提出意见后，方才进行检讨；但在最后检讨时，态度是诚恳的。鉴于李南生同志在领导上应负的责任，特给予警告处分。
    中国煤建公司副经理范菊秋直接领导器材科的工作，为木材业务的主要负责人，在运送腐朽木材进关事件发生以后，并未加以重视，只是命令器材科检查解决，没有采取有效措施加以制止，没有认真检查合同执行情况，对天津等地煤建公司提高等级出售坏木材的恶劣作风，并未检查制止。这说明范菊秋同志对自己的工作采取了不负责任的态度，应给予记过处分。
    靳连三为中国煤建公司原业务处长（一九五二年八月已调离公司），直接领导器材科，东北进关木材问题，从订合同起，至检查与执行合同，每次开会和对文件的批办，均有靳连三同志参加和签字，但他却采取了严重的不负责任的态度，对大量朽木进关的严重事件没有积极地设法解决，只推给木材科去办，以致造成巨大损失，应予记过处分。
    中国煤建公司器材科科长靳勇杰直接经手办理东北进关木材工作，但在工作中表现了严重的不负责任态度，对东北运送腐朽木材进关的严重事件，并未积极想法加以解决，且未向领导上及时提出办法和要求处理，只是在各地的报告上批示“存查”“并案办理”“归档”等字样。在检讨中态度也不虚心、诚恳，强调客观困难，企图推卸责任。鉴于靳勇杰同志这种严重不负责任的态度与不积极改正错误的态度，应予记大过处分。
