Beijing's Grassroots Election Focuses on Pilot Work

    Beijing’s pilot work focusing on grassroots elections officially began on June 9th.

    The pilot locations are thirteen streets in the Anfu Hutong area of Xidan District and three areas including Caigongzhuang Township in Haidian District and Guanzhuang Township in the Eastern Suburbs District.

    Approximately two hundred cadres are participating in the key pilot work, having undergone seven days of intensive training beforehand. During the training period, Zhang Youyu, Deputy Mayor of Beijing, Chai Zemin, Deputy Secretary-General, and heads of relevant departments gave four reports on "The Basic Spirit of the Electoral Law," "Methods, Steps, and Issues to Note in Key Pilot Work for Grassroots Elections," "Population Census and Registration," and "Voter Qualifications," respectively. After seven days of study, all cadres participating in the pilot project clearly understood the significance, methods, and steps of implementing universal suffrage and unanimously expressed their determination to do a good job in the key pilot work to create experience and promote the city's election work. During the study, technical work cadres also practiced filling out forms and voter registration certificates.

    The grassroots election pilot plan is carried out in three steps. After the cadres arrive at their work locations, the first step is to conduct preliminary publicity and understand the situation. In the suburban pilot townships, township election committees are established simultaneously. The publicity content focuses on three points: (1) the significance of universal suffrage; (2) the boundaries of who has and does not have the right to vote; and (3) what kind of people should be elected as representatives. After preliminary publicity, electoral districts are divided, investigation and registration stations are established, population census and registration are carried out, and mass voter qualification review groups are established to review voter qualifications, process voter registration, and issue voter registration certificates. The second step is for various parties and groups to negotiate and propose a list of candidates. During this stage, democracy should be fully promoted, and voters should be organized and mobilized in a guided manner, combined with carrying out the struggle against bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of law and discipline, to carefully identify and determine the official list of representative candidates. The third step is to convene voter meetings to conduct elections.

    Before the pilot cadres started their work, the person in charge of the Municipal Election Committee emphasized that the key pilot work for grassroots elections must be closely integrated with production. Publicity for the election, population census, voter registration, election, and other tasks should be carried out during the masses' production gaps. Meetings should be held at night or on Sundays, and the time should not be too long. Any coercive or commanding working methods are strictly prohibited. Publicity work should be carried out consistently from beginning to end, combined with each step of the work.

    The Beijing Municipal Election Committee has already printed all kinds of forms, certificates, and documents needed for the key pilot work.

Shanghai Officially Launches Pilot Work for Universal Suffrage

    On the basis of full preparation, Shanghai has officially launched pilot projects for grassroots elections. As early as late April and early May, the Municipal Election Committee trained cadres to carry out the pilot projects, formed six universal suffrage work teams, and sent them to various districts, and also transferred a group of cadres from various districts to strengthen these work teams. At the same time, the districts also centralized grassroots cadres, party reporters, propagandists, and mass activists in the electoral districts for training. In this way, the pilot work for grassroots elections has sufficient backbone strength. While studying, the personnel of each universal suffrage work team also conducted in-depth investigations and research in various electoral districts. On the one hand, based on past household registration materials and the understanding of grassroots cadres, they initially grasped the population and social conditions in the electoral districts and had a clear understanding. In addition, during the investigation, they also held small symposiums of representatives from various strata and adopted individual visits to understand the masses' understanding and thoughts on universal suffrage.

    By the end of May, the above-mentioned preparatory work had been completed. The Municipal Election Committee also conducted inspections and, based on some problems found in the inspections, convened a general meeting of all cadres participating in the pilot project before the official start of the pilot work, explaining in more detail the general steps of the work and arranging the main content and specific methods of mobilizing the masses and promoting the movement at various stages.

    Shanghai's grassroots election pilot areas are in Huangpu District, which is more commercially concentrated, Putuo District, which is more concentrated in factories, Zhabei District, which is more concentrated in shantytowns, and Xuhui District, which has more general households, each selecting an electoral district, as well as a town and a township in the suburbs. The pilot work is expected to be completed in two months. The first stage is mainly to carry out publicity and mobilization among the masses. Since June 1, reporters in each electoral district have made reports to the masses, and propagandists have also begun to carry out publicity activities in factory workshops and neighborhood households.

Qingdao Municipal Election Committee, Shibei District Work Team Listens to Mass Opinions and Improves Meeting Methods

    Some time ago, the Shibei District Work Team of the Qingdao Municipal Election Committee went to Shibei District to conduct pilot work for universal suffrage. As soon as the work team contacted the masses, they encountered a practical problem: the masses were not interested in attending meetings. Some people said: "We just got through the meetings for establishing neighborhood committees and implementing the Marriage Law, and now another universal suffrage work team is here. This time, we don't have to do anything else, just attend meetings!"

    It is reasonable that the masses do not like to attend meetings. In the past, meetings had three characteristics: many, delays, and long. If there was anything going on in the street, the cadres would call the masses to a meeting. The meeting time was scheduled to start at 7:00 p.m., but people did not arrive completely, and even the cadres did not arrive on time, so some people said: "If the meeting is at 7:00 p.m., you can't go wrong if you go at 8:00 p.m.!" At the meeting, the cadres talked a lot about everything, irrelevant; they talked more about principles and less about practical things. The masses said: "Whether you listen or not, it's three o'clock." "After listening for a long time, I don't know what they are talking about." In short, the masses were not satisfied with the past meeting methods, which also affected the promotion of work.

    The responsible comrades of the Shibei District Universal Suffrage Pilot Work Team seriously studied the opinions of the masses and believed that if the meeting methods were not improved, it would be difficult to do a good job in the universal suffrage pilot work. Therefore, the work team convened representative figures from all walks of life to hold symposiums and convened street cadre meetings to jointly study with the masses and cadres on how to improve the meeting methods. At the same time, they conducted mass viewpoint education for street cadres. Everyone agreed that they should cherish the time of the masses and adopt methods that were convenient for the masses to hold meetings, so that universal suffrage, production, and other work and study would not be delayed. Summarizing everyone's opinions, the ways to improve the meeting methods are as follows: 1. Meeting time: 1:30 p.m. to 3:00 p.m. every day, the majority of housewives have time, and it does not delay them from cooking, so they can hold meetings; 7:30 p.m. to 9:00 p.m., the general working people on the streets have time, so they can be called to meetings; for workers and shop assistants, in addition to those who can participate in street meetings, general make-up classes can be held on Sundays. 2. Do not hold unnecessary meetings. In the fifty-day universal suffrage pilot work, the work team plans to hold only seven mass meetings to explain to the masses the significance of universal suffrage, who has the right to vote, and who does not have the right to vote; each time will not exceed one and a half hours. After the meeting, try to organize the masses to voluntarily combine or use reading time to hold some small meetings, symposiums, and discussions. However, it must be discussed with the masses in advance. 3. Before the meeting, not only notify the masses of the meeting time, but also tell the masses what the meeting is about. The meeting time should be as short as possible, no more than one and a half hours; the work team members and street cadres should set an example and arrive at the meeting on time. 4. When lecturing, the content should be concise, to the point, and easy to understand, so that the masses can understand and remember it.

    That's how the work team did it. For example, when lecturing to residents of two residential groups at No. 12 Boxing Road, they discussed the meeting time with them in advance and told them what the content of the lecture was and how long it would take. At 7:30 p.m. on May 14, the lecturer arrived, and the masses also arrived on time. More than 90% of the adults attended the meeting; the lecture time was less than one and a half hours. The masses expressed great satisfaction with the meeting. Su Xiuying of the road said: "It's really good to discuss the meeting with everyone now. It's also easy to understand and thorough, so I can hear it clearly and remember it." Some of the masses also said after listening to the lecture: "In the future, the meeting will not delay production and work, so we have to participate in the election well and elect a representative that we are satisfied with."

Gongnong Township and Shuanglong Township in Sichuan Have Completed Universal Suffrage

    The grassroots election work of Gongnong Township in Neijiang County and Shuanglong Township in Jiangjin County, Sichuan Province, under the leadership and assistance of provincial-level organs, after more than a month of mobilizing the masses and deliberation, was held on June 1 and 2 respectively, and representatives of the township people's congress were produced. These are the first two townships in the Southwest region to complete universal suffrage.

    The voters in these two townships voted very enthusiastically. In Gongnong Township, Neijiang County, 2,894 voters participated in the voting, accounting for 91.6% of the total number of voters. In the eleventh village of the township, the voting voters reached 93.6% of the total number of voters. Women also played an active role in the election. In Yako Village, Liu Jia Village, and Xinqiao Village in Jiangjin Shuanglong Township, the women who participated in the voting accounted for about 85% of the women voters.

    This election was conducted by means of a show of hands, which also enabled the voters to elect excellent people who are fair, active, and good at handling affairs as representatives according to their own wishes. Among the 49 representatives of Jiangjin Shuanglong Township, many representatives are good cadres who have led farmers to carry out land reform and then led production, and have always been supported by the masses. For example, representative Li Jianzhang was originally a special model in the armed forces. After transferring to the local area, he served as the township head and then as the party branch secretary, and was elected as the township head at the first meeting of the township people's congress. The masses said: "Such a good township head, who else should we elect if we don't elect him." When the two townships conducted elections, they fully took care of the people of all strata. From the elected representatives, it can be seen that the representatives are broad. Among the 45 representatives of Neijiang Gongnong Township, there are representatives from all strata, including 14 Communist Party members. Among the 49 representatives of Jiangjin Shuanglong Township, there are 32 poor and hired peasants, 11 middle peasants, 3 small merchants, and one worker, handicraftsman, and primary school teacher each. Women also accounted for a considerable proportion of the representatives, with women representatives in both townships accounting for more than 20% of the total number of representatives. This ensures that the opinions of the people of all strata can be fully expressed.

    In the process of election work, because the election committee can fully mobilize the masses and conduct in-depth investigations, in the registration of voters, no citizen was wrongly deprived of the right to vote, and no reactionary element or landlord class element who has not changed his composition illegally stole the right to vote. After the voter list was announced, a total of 50 people in the two townships who had not obtained the right to vote filed appeals to the election committee and the people's court, requesting a re-examination of their history. After in-depth investigation and verification of materials, 10 people obtained the right to vote. Jiangjin Shuanglong Township had previously wrongly issued 15 voter registration certificates to landlord class elements and reactionary elements who had not changed their composition. After being exposed by the masses, the election committee revoked the voter registration certificates of these elements after verifying various materials. In the nomination of candidates, each voter group conducted full deliberation and conducted open criticism and self-criticism of village cadres, which greatly improved the relationship between cadres and the masses. The voters compared the candidates proposed by each group and selected the best ones as candidates. After the representatives were selected, the two townships then held their first township people's congress respectively, and elected government committee members and township head and deputy township head, and established the township people's government.

Shaanxi Lintong Lishan District Grassroots Election Pilot Township Has Completed Population Census and Voter Registration Work

    Seven townships in Lishan District, Lintong County, Shaanxi Province, which are conducting pilot projects for grassroots elections, have successfully completed the population census and voter registration work. After the local people were generally exposed to the publicity of universal suffrage, they enthusiastically supported the Electoral Law and actively participated in the universal suffrage movement.

    Before the population census and voter registration, the work teams participating in the pilot work of each township first organized more than 700 township and village-level cadres, propagandists, and mass activists to study the Electoral Law and relevant documents on universal suffrage. They also conducted business training on population census and voter registration for technicians. At the same time, they adopted the form of household head symposiums in each electoral district and family visits to widely carry out diverse publicity activities on universal suffrage among the masses.

    When conducting population census and voter registration, these pilot townships adopted various methods to facilitate the voters. Voter registration stations were set up in each electoral district, and sufficient manpower was assigned. Each registration station in the fourth township had seven people in charge of the technical work of registration, and the cadres of the work team participated in specific guidance. Their work efficiency was very high. One registration station investigated and registered 14 households and 71 people in two hours. In order to facilitate the registration of voters in mountainous areas, the registration station in the ninth township also adopted the methods of mobile registration and door-to-door registration. The work was carried out quickly and meticulously, and it did not delay production. The farmers were very happy.

    Through universal suffrage publicity and voter registration, the people's political awareness has been further enhanced, and the distinction between the enemy and us has been further clarified. Many people have earnestly participated in the work of reviewing voter qualifications. After the voter lists in each electoral district were announced, the masses gathered around and carefully checked them.

    Now, each pilot township is closely cooperating with the current overriding task of summer harvest, further carrying out publicity among the masses, and at the same time conducting in-depth understanding of the situation and deliberation of the list of candidates.

    贯彻选举法，开展普选工作
    北京基层选举重点试办工作开始
    北京市基层选举的重点试办工作于六月九日正式开始。
    试办地点为西单区安福胡同一带的十三条街道和海淀区蔡公庄乡、东郊区关庄乡等三个地区。
    参加重点试办工作的干部约近二百人，事前经过了七天的集中训练。训练期间，北京市人民政府副市长张友渔、副秘书长柴泽民及各有关部门的负责人，分别作了关于“选举法的基本精神”、“基层选举重点试验工作的方法、步骤及应注意的问题”、
    “人口调查登记”、“选民资格”等四个报告。经过七天的学习，参加试点的全体干部明确认识了实行普选的意义、方法和步骤，一致表示要把重点试办工作作好，以便创造经验，推动全市的选举工作。学习中并对技术工作的干部，进行了填表与填写选民证的预习。
    基层选举的试办计划分三个步骤进行。干部到达工作地点后，第一步进行初步宣传及了解情况的工作，在郊区试点乡并同时成立乡选举委员会。宣传内容着重三点：（一）普选的意义；（二）有选举权和无选举权的界限；（三）应该选什么人当代表。经过初步宣传后，即划分选区建立调查登记站，办理人口调查登记，并吸收群众成立选民资格审查小组，对选民资格进行审查，办理选民登记，填发选民证。第二步由各党派、团体协商酝酿提出候选人名单。这一阶段内，要充分发扬民主，有领导地组织和发动选民，结合开展反对官僚主义、反对命令主义、反对违法乱纪的斗争，认真鉴别并确定代表候选人的正式名单。第三步召开选民大会进行选举。
    在试点干部进行工作之前，市选举委员会负责人强调指出：基层选举的重点试办工作必需密切结合生产进行。选举的宣传、人口调查、选民登记、选举等项工作，要抓紧群众的生产空隙进行，开会要争取在夜间或星期日，且时间不宜过长，并严禁任何强迫命令的工作方法。宣传工作则应结合每个步骤的工作自始至终的贯彻进行。
    重点试办工作中需用的各种表册、证件，北京市选举委员会均已印就。
    北京市基层选举试办工作预计七月中旬结束。（据新华社讯）
    上海市普选试办工作正式展开
    上海市基层选举的典型试办工作已在充分准备的基础上正式展开。早在四月下旬至五月初，市选举委员会训练了进行典型试办工作的干部，组成六个普选工作队分别派到各区，并在各区抽调一批干部充实了这些工作队。同时，各区还集中了选区内的基层干部，党的报告员、宣传员和群众积极分子进行训练。这样，就使基层选举的典型试办工作有了充足的骨干力量。每个普选工作队的人员在进行学习的同时，还在各选区作了深入的调查研究工作。他们一方面根据过去的户口材料和基层干部的了解，初步掌握了选区内的人口情况和社会情况，做到了心中有数。另外，在调查中，他们还召开各阶层代表的小型座谈会，并采取个别访问的方式，了解群众对普选的认识和思想情况。
    到五月底止，上述准备工作都已就绪，市选举委员会又分别作了检查，根据检查中发现的一些问题，在试办工作正式展开之前，召开了参加试办工作的全体干部大会，比较具体地说明了工作的大体步骤，布置了各个阶段发动群众与推动运动的主要内容和具体方法。
    上海市的基层选举典型试办地区是在商业较为集中的黄浦区、工厂较为集中的普陀区、棚户比较集中的闸北区、一般住户较多的徐汇区各选择一个选区，以及市郊的一镇、一乡，试办工作预计两个月完成。第一阶段主要是向群众进行宣传动员。从六月一日起各选区已由报告员分别向群众作了报告，宣传员也开始在工厂的车间、里弄的住户中展开宣传活动。（据新华社讯）
    青岛市选举委员会市北区工作队倾听群众意见改善开会方法
    前些日子，青岛市选举委员会市北区工作队到市北区进行普选典型试办工作。工作队刚刚和群众接触，就碰到一个实际问题：群众对开会不感兴趣。有人说：“才把建立居民委员会和贯彻婚姻法的会熬过去，又来了一个普选工作队，这回不用干别的了，光开会吧！”
    群众不爱开会是有道理的。过去开会有三个特点：多，拖，长。街道上有一点事，干部就召集群众开会。开会的时间规定晚上七点钟开始，可是人到不齐，连干部都不按时到会，所以有人说： “要是七点钟开会，你八点钟去没错！”开会了，干部山南海北大讲一通，不着边际；道理讲的多，实事讲的少。群众说：“听不听，三点钟。”“听了老半天，不知道说些什么。”总之，群众对过去开会的方法是不满意的，因此也使工作的推行受到影响。
    市北区普选典型试办工作队的负责同志认真地研究了群众的意见，认为如果不改善开会方法，将很难做好普选试办工作。于是，工作队一方面召集各界代表性的人物举行座谈会，一面召开街道干部会，和群众、干部共同研究如何改善会议的开法，同时，并对街道干部进行群众观点的教育。大家一致认为应该珍贵群众的时间，采取便利群众的方法开会，做到普选和生产及其他工作、学习都不误。把大家的意见归纳起来，改善开会方法的办法有以下四点：一、会议时间：每天下午一点半到三点钟，广大家庭妇女有时间，也不耽误她们做饭，可以开会；晚上七点半钟到九点钟，街道上一般劳动人民有时间，可以召集他们开会；对于工人、店员，除了能够参加街道会议的以外，一般的可在星期天进行补课。二、不开不必要的会议。工作队在五十天的普选试办工作中，打算只开七次群众会，向群众讲解普选的意义，什么人有选举权和什么人没有选举权等问题；每次均不超过一个半钟头，会后尽量组织群众自愿结合或利用读报时间开一些小会，座谈、讨论。但是，预先必须和群众商量好。三、在开会以前，不仅通知群众什么时间开会，还要告诉群众开什么会。会议的时间尽量短，最多不超过一个半钟头；工作队人员和街道干部要以身作则，准时到会。四、讲课时，内容要简明，扼要，通俗，使群众听得懂，记得住。
    工作队就这样办了。如对博兴路十二号两个居民组居民讲课时，预先和他们商量好开会的时间，告诉他们讲课的内容是什么，需要多长的时间。五
    月十四日晚上七点半钟，讲课的人到了，群众也按时到了，到会的群众占成年人的百分之九十以上；讲课的时间不到一个半钟头。群众对这个会表示十分满意。该路苏秀英说：“现在开会和大伙商量真好。也讲的通俗，说的透彻，俺能听清楚，也能记住。”有的群众听了课以后还表示：“往后开会不耽误生产和工作了，咱更得好好地参加选举，选一个自己称心如意的人当代表。”（叶予）
    四川工农乡和双龙乡已完成普选
    四川省内江县工农乡和江津县双龙乡的基层选举
    工作，在省级机关领导和帮助下，经过一个多月的发动群众和酝酿的过程，已在六月一日和二日分别举行，产生了乡人民代表大会的代表，这是西南区最早完成普选的两个乡。
    这两个乡投票的选民非常踊跃。内江县工农乡参加投票的选民有二千八百九十四人，占选民总数百分之九十一点六。该乡十一村，投票选民达选民总数百分之九十三点六。妇女在选举中也发挥了积极性，江津双龙乡垭口村、刘家村、新桥村等三个村，参加投票的妇女，占妇女选民百分之八十五左右。
    这次选举是采取举手表决的方式，这种方式同样能使选民们按照自己的意愿，把办事公正积极的优秀人物选为代表，江津双龙乡四十九个代表中，许多代表是从领导农民进行土地改革，以后又领导生产，一直为群众拥护的好干部。如代表黎建章，原是武装部队中的特等模范，转到地方以后任乡长，以后又任党支部书记，并在乡人民代表大会第一次会议上当选为乡长。群众说：“这样好的乡长，不选他选谁。”两个乡在进行选举时，充分照顾到各阶层的人民，从选出来的代表中，可以看出代表的广泛性。内江工农乡四十五个代表中，包括了各阶层的代表人物，其中共产党员占十四人。江津双龙乡的四十九个代表中，贫农雇农共三十二人，中农十一人，小商人三人，工人、手工业者、及小学教员各一人。妇女在代表中也占了相当比例，两乡的妇女代表都占代表总数百分之二十以上。这就保证了各阶层人民的意见能充分表达。
    在选举工作的过程中，由于选举委员会能充分发动群众，深入调查，因而在登记选民中，没有一个公民被错误地剥夺选举权利，也没有让一个反动分子或未经改变成分的地主阶级分子非法窃取选举权利。在选民名单公布后，两乡共有五十个未获得选举权利的人向选举委员会及人民法庭提出申诉，要求重新审查他们的历史，经过深入调查、对证材料后，有十人获得了选举权利。江津双龙乡原先曾错发了十五个选民证给未经改变成分的地主阶级分子及反动分子，经群众揭发，选举委员会又根据各种材料对证后，撤回了这些分子的选民证。在候选人提名中，各选民小组进行了充分的酝酿，对乡村干部进行了公开的批评和自我批评，这就大大改善了干部和群众的关系。选民们分别将各小组提出的候选人进行比较，选择了最好的作为候选人。代表选定后，两个乡接着就分别举行第一次乡人民代表大会，选出了政府委员及乡长、副乡长，成立了乡人民政府。（新华社）
    陕西临潼骊山区基层选举试办乡已完成人口调查和选民登记工作
    正在进行基层选举典型试办工作的陕西省临潼县骊山区七个乡，已顺利完成了人口调查和选民登记工作。当地人民普遍受到普选的宣传后，都热烈拥护选举法，积极参加普选运动。
    在人口调查、选民登记以前，参加各乡试办工作的工作组首先组织七百多个乡、村级干部、宣传员和群众积极分子，学习了选举法和有关普选的文件，对技术人员还进行了人口调查、选民登记的业务训练，同时采用各选区的户长座谈会以及家庭访问等形式，在群众中广泛展开多样性的普选宣传活动。
    这些试办乡在进行人口调查和选民登记时，都采取了各种便利选民的方法进行工作。各选区都设立了选民登记站，并配备了充实的人力。第四乡每个登记站都有七个人担任登记的技术工作，工作组干部参加具体指导。他们的工作效率都很高，有一个登记站在两个钟头内就调查和登记了十四户、七十
    一人。第九乡的登记站为了便利山区选民登记，还采用了巡回登记和逐户登记的办法，工作进行得又快又细致，又不耽误生产，农民们都很高兴。
    通过普选宣传和选民登记等工作，更加提高了人民的政治觉悟，进一步划清了敌我界限。很多人都认真参加了审查选民资格的工作。各选区选民名单公布后，群众纷纷围着细心查看。
    现在，各试办乡正密切配合当前压倒一切的夏收任务，在群众中进一步展开宣传，同时进行深入了解情况和酝酿提候选人名单的工作。
