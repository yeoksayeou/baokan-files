To Commander Peng Dehuai, all commanders, fighters, political workers, and logistics personnel comrades of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army:

    As the motherland enters a new period of large-scale construction, the Seventh Plenary (Enlarged) Meeting of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League is being held in the capital of the motherland. We, on behalf of all members of the China Democratic League, extend our highest respect to the heroic comrades of the People's Volunteer Army.

    Our meeting focused on discussing the current international and domestic situations and tasks. We deeply realize that your great victory on the Korean battlefield has greatly enhanced the international status of the motherland and encouraged the confidence and courage of the people of the world to oppose aggression and strive for peace. We also clearly recognize that in the current international situation of confrontation between the camp of peace and democracy and the camp of imperialist aggression, we must resolutely distinguish between the enemy, ourselves, and our friends, and learn from your great spirit of combining high patriotism with internationalism.

    The meeting has successfully concluded today. We, on behalf of all members of the China Democratic League, assure you that we will abide by the resolutions of this meeting, distinguish between the enemy and ourselves, strengthen unity, strengthen learning, continue ideological transformation, and work actively in national construction, especially in cultural and educational construction. We, together with the people of the whole country, actively support your just and victorious struggle on the Korean front and strive for a fair and reasonable solution to the Korean issue. Under the glorious banner of Mao Zedong and under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the China Democratic League calls on and promotes all members to strive to complete the three major tasks of the country, thoroughly realize the Common Program, build a new democratic country, and advance towards socialism. Finally, we wish you victory and more victories!
    The Seventh Plenary (Enlarged) Meeting of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League
