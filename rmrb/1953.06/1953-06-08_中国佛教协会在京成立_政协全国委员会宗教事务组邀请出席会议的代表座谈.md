Xinhua News Agency, 7th June: The inaugural meeting of the Chinese Buddhist Association was held from May 30th to June 3rd at Guangji Temple in Beijing, formally establishing the Chinese Buddhist Association.

The representatives attending the meeting included 121 prominent figures from the Buddhist community across the country. Among them were living Buddhas, Khenpos, Geshes, and Lamas from famous monasteries such as Drepung Monastery, Sera Monastery, and Ganden Monastery in Lhasa, Tibet; Tashilhunpo Monastery in Xigaze; Ta'er Monastery in Qinghai; Labrang Monastery in Gansu; Bailing Temple in Inner Mongolia; as well as Dharma Masters, monks, and nuns from famous mountains and ancient temples such as Mount Emei in Sichuan, Mount Wutai in Shanxi, and Mount Jiuhua in Anhui, and prominent lay Buddhists from various regions. The representatives included members of the Han, Tibetan, Mongolian, Dai, Salar, and Uyghur ethnic groups.

Master Xirao Jiacuo delivered the opening speech at the meeting. Lay Buddhist Zhao Puchu, Director of the Preparatory Office of the Chinese Buddhist Association, reported on the initiation and preparation process of the Chinese Buddhist Association and proposed suggestions for the purpose and tasks of establishing the Chinese Buddhist Association. The meeting invited Wang Feng, Deputy Director of the State Nationalities Affairs Commission of the Central People's Government, to give a report on current affairs.

After repeated deliberations and consultations, the representatives attending the meeting determined that the purpose of the Chinese Buddhist Association would be: to unite Buddhists nationwide, under the leadership of the People's Government, to participate in the movement to love the country and defend world peace, to assist the People's Government in implementing the policy of freedom of religious belief; and to connect with Buddhists in various regions to promote the excellent traditions of Buddhism. The meeting elected the Dalai Lama, the Panchen Erdene, Xu Yun, and Chagan Gegen as honorary presidents of the Chinese Buddhist Association, and elected Yuan Ying as president, with Xirao Jiacuo, Gongdelin Jinmeijicun, Neng Hai, Zhao Puchu, Gala Zang, Huba, and Awang Jiacuo as vice presidents. The meeting also established the Council and the Standing Council of the Chinese Buddhist Association.

After discussing the reports by Deputy Director Wang Feng and Lay Buddhist Zhao Puchu, the representatives' belief in loving the country and defending world peace was strengthened. More than twenty representatives who spoke at the conference all accused the imperialists and the Kuomintang reactionaries of oppressing and persecuting Chinese Buddhists before liberation, and explained that after liberation, under the brilliant light of Chairman Mao's policy of national equality and religious freedom, Buddhists in various regions, like the people of the whole country, gained happiness and freedom. The representatives firmly stated that they would continue to draw a clear line between ourselves and the enemy in thought and action, eliminate the spies and secret agents directed by the imperialists and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, as well as the reactionary secret societies who falsely claimed to be Buddhist and attempted to hide, form a solid patriotic united front with the people of the whole country, and work hard to love the motherland and defend world peace. Living Buddha Gongdelin Jinmeijicun, representative of Drepung Monastery in Lhasa, said in his speech: Today, we can establish the Chinese Buddhist Association in Beijing, the capital of the people. This is a great and rare event unprecedented in the history of Chinese Buddhism. This is the result of the correct implementation of Chairman Mao's ethnic policy and religious policy by the people's governments at all levels. In order to make all living beings obtain eternal joy, our various ethnic groups must unite more closely to build the mainland and Tibet of the motherland. After we return to Tibet, we will convey the spirit of this conference to the monks, nuns, and lay people of Tibet and work together to defend world peace.

The meeting finally passed a telegram of respect to Chairman Mao and a telegram of respect to the Chinese People's Volunteers.

Xinhua News Agency, 7th June: The Religious Affairs Group of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), invited all the representatives attending the inaugural meeting of the Chinese Buddhist Association to a symposium on June 3rd.
