Moscow is admired by the hearts of progressive people all over the world, and the eyes of millions of people are focused on Moscow. Moscow has been built into a magnificent and majestic city, a brilliant example among all the capitals of the world. In order to create a better and happier life, the Soviet people are continuing to build the capital of this socialist country with great enthusiasm and creative labor.

The Soviet color documentary "Moscow Under Construction" shows very moving scenes. We can see on the screen that in every corner of Moscow, people are engaged in intense labor, and all kinds of machines are exerting their power on the ground and underground. Moscow is rapidly expanding towards the sky, underground, and in all directions. The old, winding and narrow streets have been opened up into wide and flat avenues; the rows of cars advancing on the streets are like an endless river; the magnificent underground railway connects the capital's center with the suburban transportation lines; the constructed canal connects the Moscow River and the Volga River, making Moscow a port directly connected to five seas. Moscow's urban area is expanding in all directions, and many wide and beautiful streets have appeared in the formerly empty suburbs, with tall and beautiful buildings standing on both sides. Well-equipped new residences, schools, theaters, sports fields, clubs... are all being built in large quantities. The environment of Moscow is also constantly being beautified, and many newly built boulevards, street gardens, parks, lawns, trees, fountains, and sculptures make Moscow a green, beautiful, and artistically flavored big city.

What is particularly exciting is that we see the Moscow subway and many soaring buildings that are still under construction.

The subway is 60 kilometers long. It passes through 18 districts of Moscow, connecting many stations in Moscow. During the 15 years of construction, it has carried about 6 billion passengers, almost twice the world's population. It is not an ordinary subway, but a magnificent underground palace. Each station hall is decorated with valuable building materials such as marble, bronze, gems, glass, ceramics, and polished wood. The meticulous and ingenious design, exquisite paintings, and sculptures everywhere demonstrate the high development of Soviet architectural art and culture. The Komsomolskaya station that appears on the screen, with its spacious and magnificent hall and bright and soft light, simply makes people forget that this is deep underground.

Moscow is developing not only underground but also in the high sky. According to Comrade Stalin’s initiative, a new general plan for the construction of Moscow has been formulated. Under the unified architectural intention, multi-story buildings that soar into the clouds are constantly appearing in various districts of the capital. We can see that a 26-story hotel with 1,000 rooms is being built on the Dorogomilovskaya embankment; large and magnificent construction projects are in full swing in Komsomolskaya Square, Uprising Square, Red Gate, and Smolensk Square.

The greatest building appearing on the screen is the new campus of the State Moscow University on Lenin Hills. It is composed of dozens of large buildings connected together, with a total volume of 2.6 million cubic meters. It has 150 huge lecture halls and classrooms, about 700 well-equipped laboratories, and thousands of exquisitely furnished rooms for university professors and students. The entire building has 33 kilometers of corridors, and more than 100 automatic elevators for various purposes will be installed in the entire building. The tallest building is more than 200 meters high, where you can overlook the entire Moscow, like looking down from an airplane. This is the most magnificent scientific palace of the Soviet era. And many young men and women who participated in this great construction work will also become university students of this school.

In this film, we see that the Soviet construction industry has been completely industrialized and mechanized. What the workers do is to install the parts made in the factory into houses according to the design drawings, just like installing machines in the factory. All laborious work has been replaced by advanced machinery, and cumbersome construction work has become a clever installation art. What we see on the screen is a mythical labor process: the skeleton of a multi-story building is composed of steel frames, and construction workers use various types of cranes and various clever small machines to assemble various prefabricated large parts: building partitions, large cement slabs, walls with window frames, entire sections of stairs, and architectural decorations. The foundation of a multi-story building can be laid with ready-made large cement slabs in just ten days; three cement slabs can be installed to form the ceiling of a room; two prefabricated sections of stairs and two cement slabs can form
a complete staircase on one floor. At the same time as the construction of the building, the workers in charge of artistic decoration are carrying out the interior and exterior decoration work according to precise design drawings. Even the decorative parts of the interior walls are prefabricated, and only need to be installed.

All the moving scenes we saw in the film are just as the great Soviet writer Gorky said: "In the world, labor has never shown such a mythical and enormous power as it does today in our worker-peasant country."

    莫斯科——全世界人民所仰望的和平建设的榜样
    ——介绍苏联彩色纪录影片“莫斯科在建设中”

    全世界进步人类的心都仰慕着莫斯科，千万人的眼睛都注视着莫斯科。莫斯科已建设成一座壮丽、雄伟的城市，它在世界所有的首都中是辉煌的榜样。苏联人民为了创造更美满、幸福的生活，正以巨大的热情和创造性的劳动，继续建设着这座社会主义国家的首都。
    苏联彩色纪录片“莫斯科在建设中”显示了十分动人的情景。我们从银幕可以看到：在莫斯科的每个角落里，人们都正在进行着紧张的劳动，各种各样的机器在地上、地下施展着它们的威力。莫斯科在向天空、地下，向四面八方迅速伸展着。旧日弯曲狭窄的街道，已开辟成宽阔平坦的大道了；街道上成排前进的汽车，像一条流不完的河水；富丽堂皇的地下铁道，连接着首都中心和市郊的交通干线；修建的运河沟通了莫斯科河和伏尔加河，使莫斯科成为直通五个大海的港口。莫斯科的市区向四周扩展着，旧日空旷的郊区，现在出现了许多宽阔漂亮的街道，两旁矗立着高大美丽的楼房。设备完善的新住宅、学校、剧院、运动场、俱乐部……都在大量的增建中。莫斯科的环境也在不断美化着，许多新修的林荫大道、沿街花园、公园、草地、树丛、喷泉、雕塑，使莫斯科变成一座绿化的、美丽的、有艺术风味的大城市。
    特别使人兴奋的是，我们看到了正在继续修建中的莫斯科地下铁道和许多耸入云霄的楼房建筑。
    地下铁道全长六十公里，它通过莫斯科的十八个区域，连接着莫斯科许多车站，十五年来在修建过程中就已经载运了六十亿次左右的乘客，几乎超过了全世界人口的二倍。它不是一条普通的地下铁道，而是宏大壮丽的地下宫殿。每个车站大厅都是用大理石、青铜、宝石、玻璃、陶瓷、磨光木料等贵重的建筑材料装饰起来的，周密精巧的设计，精美的绘画、雕塑，到处表现了苏维埃建筑艺术和文化的高度发展。出现在银幕上的共青团车站，它那宽敞华丽的大厅和明亮柔和的光线，简直使人忘记了这是在地下的深处。
    莫斯科不仅向地下而且也向高空发展。根据斯大林同志的倡导，制订了新的建设莫斯科的总计划，在统一的建筑意图下，首都各区不断出现着高耸入云的多层建筑。我们可以看到：在多洛郭米洛夫斯克河岸，正建筑着一座二十六层高，设有一千个房间的大旅馆；在共青团广场、在起义广场、在红色大门旁、在斯摩棱斯克广场……高大雄伟的建筑工程都在紧张地进行着。
    银幕上出现一座最伟大的建筑，那就是在列宁山上的国立莫斯科大学的新校舍。这是由连接在一起的几十个大建筑物所组成的，它的总体积达二百六十万立方公尺。它有一百五十个巨大讲堂和教室，有七百个左右设备完善的实验室，有几千个供大学教授、大学生居住的陈设精美的房间，全楼走廊有三十三公里长，在整个建筑里将安装一百多个各种用途的自动电梯。最高的楼房，高达二百多公尺，在这里可以俯瞰莫斯科全景，像在飞机上向下了望一样。这是苏维埃时代最雄伟壮丽的科学宫殿。而参加这个伟大建筑工作的许多男女青年，也就要成为这个学校的大学生。
    在这部影片里，我们看到苏联的建筑工业已完全工厂化、机械化了，工人们所做的是按照设计图样，把工厂里制好的零件安装成房屋，像工厂里安装机器一样。一切费力的劳动已被先进的机械代替了，笨重的建筑工作，已成为巧妙的安装艺术。我们在银幕上看到的是神话般的劳动过程：一座多层楼房的骨架是用钢架组成的，建筑工人使用各种类型的起重机和各种灵巧的小机器，把各种制好的大型零件：楼房的隔板、大块的水泥板、带窗框的墙壁、整段的楼梯以及建筑的装饰物安装起来。一座多层楼房的地基，用现成的大块水泥板，只要十天便可以打好；三块水泥板可以安装成一间房子的天花板；两段预制好的楼梯和两块水泥板，可以组成
    一层楼房的完整楼梯。和建筑物修建的同时，负责艺术装饰的工人们，按照精确的设计图样进行着室内室外的装饰工作，连室内墙壁的装饰零件都是预制好的，只需要安装一下就行了。
    我们从影片里所看到的一切动人情景，都正如苏联伟大作家高尔基所说的：“在世界上，劳动一直没有表现过像今天在我们工农国家里，这样神话般的巨大力量。”
