The drilling work of the Tongguanshan Exploration Team has changed from its backward state in January and February. In January and February of this year, the team's drilling rigs were not fully operational on time, and serious accidents often occurred. For example, No. 2 drilling rig was old and in disrepair, and it broke down shortly after being started, resulting in a month of no drilling progress; No. 3 drilling rig experienced a stuck drill accident, delaying progress for thirty-five days, seriously affecting the completion of the drilling task. Based on this situation, the leadership mobilized the workers to inspect the causes of the accidents and improve them, reversing this situation. By March 28, the first quarter's drilling plan was completed, and by March 31, it exceeded the original target by 3.8 percent. On this basis, the workers were further mobilized to summarize their experiences and lessons learned, and the second quarter drilling plan was formulated. This plan exceeded the actual completion volume of the first quarter by 31 percent. In April, the team has completed 33.887 percent of the second quarter plan.

The basic reason why the Tongguanshan Team overfulfilled its tasks is that it relies on and mobilizes the workers. When it was discovered at the end of February that only 60 percent of the plan had been completed, the team first mobilized the workers to conduct democratic inspections. The opinions raised by the workers can be summarized into three categories: first, safety issues; second, technical guidance and the coordination between geology and drilling; and third, wage and welfare issues. In addition, there was also a lack of unity among the workers. Based on these situations, the team first strengthened political and ideological leadership, strengthened unity, and carried out criticism and self-criticism. The team's leading cadres all conducted self-criticisms based on the opinions of the masses, and the workers also carried out criticism and self-criticism at the weekly political lessons and life review meetings. More than 90 percent of the team's drilling workers are young people, and the Communist Youth League has particularly strengthened its activities, so that ordinary workers realize that drilling work is the vanguard of national construction and must be completed diligently. For example, under difficult conditions, the workers of No. 8 rig carried water themselves for supply, overfulfilled the task, and were the first to learn the Soviet single-shot sand injection method, creating the highest average core recovery record (89 percent).

The second is to mobilize workers to check for accidents, eliminate accidents, and the leadership concentrates on workers' creations and rationalization proposals, and strengthens technical guidance and security work. After February, the team held accident review meetings, mobilized workers to find the causes, find responsibilities, and find prevention methods. When a major accident occurred on No. 3 rig, the team concentrated technical personnel and experienced workers to come up with solutions together, and afterward printed them into handouts to educate everyone. Secondly, based on the causes of accidents, business learning was carried out, explaining the machine's performance and operating methods from the principle, and the old workers introduced their own operating experience and methods to avoid accidents. The engineering group concentrated on the workers' creations and rationalization proposals, promoted them, and prevented accidents from occurring. For example, No. 5 drilling rig added a transverse machine mask, overcoming the problem of impacting gears when drilling tools were raised and lowered.

Third, the team attaches importance to the promotion of advanced Soviet experience and the inventions of workers, which greatly improves efficiency and saves funds. The team has promoted the Soviet experience of injecting a large amount of sand at once. In the past, the maximum amount injected each time was three to four kilograms, but now it is twelve to fifteen kilograms each time in diorite. This has improved the core recovery rate and speed, especially in diorite. The average drilling speed per shift is two meters, and the highest is 2.5 meters. In the past, No. 7 rig drilled 0.9 to 1.3 meters per shift per day, but now the highest is 3.2 meters. The core recovery rate is generally above 80 percent, and the highest is 99 percent.

The team has also made appropriate improvements to the living and welfare problems of the employees.

At present, the problems that the Tongguanshan Team needs to further solve are that the leadership cannot keep up with the workers' requirements, the management cannot keep up with the development of production, and the coordination between geology and drilling is insufficient.

    铜官山勘探队依靠职工、学习苏联经验
    减少事故提高钻进速度和岩心采取率
    铜官山勘探队的钻探工作，已改变了一、二月份的落后状态。今年一、二月份，该队钻机未按时开足，并常发生严重的事故。如二号钻机年久失修，开动不久就坏了，一个月没有钻进；三号钻机发生卡钻事故，耽误三十五天，严重影响了钻探任务的完成。领导上根据这种情况，发动工人检查事故的原因，加以改进，扭转了这个局面。到三月二十八日就完成第一季度的钻探计划，三十一日就超过原任务百分之三点八。在这个基础上，又进一步发动工人总结了经验教训，制定了第二季度钻探计划，这个计划比第一季度实际完成数超过百分之三十一，四月份该队已完成第二季度计划的百分之三十三点八八七。
    铜官山队超额完成任务的基本原因就是依靠与发动工人。当二月底发现计划只完成百分之六十时，该队首先发动工人进行民主检查。工人所提的意见，归纳起来有三类，一是安全问题，二是技术指导及地质与钻探配合问题，三是工资福利问题。除此以外，工人之间还存在着不团结的现象。根据这些情况，该队首先加强政治思想领导，加强团结，开展批评与自我批评。该队的领导干部都根据群众的意见，分别进行了检讨，工人在每星期的政治课与生活检讨会上也开展批评与自我批评。该队百分之九十以上的钻探工是青年，青年团就特别加强了活动，使一般工人都认识到钻探工作是建设祖国的先锋，必须努力完成。如八号机在困难的条件下，工人自己担水供应，超额完成任务，并且首先学习苏联一次投砂法，创造了平均岩心采取的最高纪录
    （百分之八十九）。
    第二是发动工人检查事故，消灭事故，领导上集中工人的创造与合理化建议，加强了技术指导与保安工作。二月份后，该队召开事故检讨会，发动工人找原因，找责任，找防止办法。三号机发生重大事故，该队就集中技术人员与有经验的工人，共同想办法，事后并印成讲义教育大家。其次是根据事故发生的原因，进行业务学习，从原理上说明机器性能与操作方法，并由老工人介绍自己操作经验和避免事故的办法。工务组则集中工人的创造与合理化建议，加以推广，防止事故发生。如五号钻机加上横机口罩，克服了上下钻具时冲击齿轮的毛病。
    第三，该队重视推广苏联先进经验与工人的创造发明，使效率大大提高，并节省了资财。该队推广了苏联一次大量投砂的经验，过去每次最高投三至四公斤，现在在闪长岩中每次投十二至十五公斤。提高了岩心采取率与进度，特别是在闪长岩中效率尤高。每班平均钻进二公尺，最高达二点五公尺。七号机过去每班每日钻进零点九至一点三公尺，现在最高达三点二公尺。岩心采取率一般在百分之八十以上，最高达百分之九十九。
    职工的生活福利问题，该队也作了适当改进。
    目前铜官山队需进一步解决的问题是领导赶不上工人要求，管理赶不上生产的发展，地质与钻探配合不够。
