Two Work Groups in Minhou County Forcibly Promoted "Combined Style" Rice Seedlings, Causing Losses to the Masses' Production and Damage to the People's Government's Prestige

The work groups sent by the Third and Tenth Districts of Minhou, Fujian, to Dongqi and Gaozhou Townships to lead spring plowing production rigidly applied methods from other areas and forced farmers to plant "combined style" rice seedlings, blindly calling for "the denser the planting, the better," causing losses to the masses' production.

At the beginning of spring plowing, the district's work group went to Dongqi Township to lead production. In order to improve agricultural technology, the work group called on farmers to plant "combined style" rice seedling fields this year, four feet wide, with one foot left in the middle, and small ridges on both sides, adopting a "small-plant dense planting" method with a nine-inch spacing between plants. The area is close to the mouth of the Minjiang River, and the sea breeze is relatively strong. Local farmers were afraid that the small seedling beds would be easily attacked by the sea breeze, and they were also afraid that the small ridges would not be good for drainage and irrigation, and that they would rot in the event of continuous rain, so they were unwilling to make "combined style" rice seedling beds. The work group did not deeply understand the masses' concerns and did not think of ways to resolve them. In order to complete the task quickly, they simply introduced the situation of making combined-style seedling fields in other places at the farmers' representative meetings and mutual aid group leader meetings, and made a four-foot-long bamboo ruler to hang at the bridgehead intersection, with a notice posted next to it, requiring farmers to make combined-style seedling fields according to this scale. Then, the work group went to the fields to supervise the farmers to do the same. One farmer, because he sowed the earliest, did not make seedling fields according to the four-foot-wide standard, nor did he make small ridges. The township government believed that this was a "typical example of educating the masses," so they called the farmer to the township government and asked him to guarantee that others would make good combined-style seedling fields, otherwise he would be held responsible; and they forced him to accept before releasing him on bail. Under the threat and surveillance of the work group, most of the masses did not dare to raise any more opinions; they reluctantly made combined-style seedling fields. A few days after sowing the seedling fields, they happened to encounter a cold wave, the climate suddenly became cold, and at the same time, it was continuously rainy; in addition, although the masses planted combined-style seedling fields, they still adopted the old method of managing seedling fields, and did not often drain and irrigate. As a result, the water in the seedling fields with small ridges was trapped, and widespread seedling rot occurred. After this situation occurred, the work group cadres did not take effective measures to lead the masses to rescue the seedlings, but only passively called on the masses to use the method of transplanting small plants to overcome the shortage of seedlings. After the masses suffered losses, they were very dissatisfied, complaining that the work group did not understand the local situation and rigidly applied methods from other places. Afterwards, the district and township cadres relaxed their leadership of this work, and the masses spontaneously replanted more than a thousand catties of seeds and rushed to other places to buy some rice seedlings. Even so, more than six mu of double-cropping rice fields in the whole township were left barren for one season due to the lack of seedlings. Because of this incident, the masses were no longer willing to trust the cadres. When the comrades of the work group walked past the bridgehead intersection, the masses sarcastically said in cold words: "The combined-style seedling fields are well made, but no household has seedlings to transplant." After this incident occurred, the work group still did not learn a good lesson. When leading the masses to transplant seedlings, they ignored the masses' concerns that densely planted late rice would be crushed by the lodging of early rice, and again made a five-foot four-inch long bamboo ruler to hang at the bridgehead intersection, and also posted a strip of paper next to it, telling farmers to transplant six plants according to this ruler (the local original habit was six plants in six feet wide). The masses no longer believed the words of the district work group cadres, and in addition, they were afraid of suffering losses and did not dare to risk the experiment, so they did not accept dense planting. Some farmers said: We only have five points eight mu of land per person (the local land reform average), what if dense planting goes wrong?

In order to complete the "task" of promoting combined-style seedling fields and dense planting, the Gaozhou Township work group of the Tenth District of Minhou County mobilized the masses to challenge and respond, proposing the slogan "the sparser the sowing, the better, the denser the planting, the better," as a result, some mu of seedling fields only sowed fifty catties of seeds, and the plant spacing of some intercropping fields was only four or five inches. The township cadres and the masses could not understand it and were worried. When the work group leader was about to leave, the township cadres and the masses held him and refused to let him go, saying: "You can't leave, wait until we harvest and then leave!"

This not only caused losses to the masses, but also damaged the prestige of the Party and the government among the masses.

Many cadres in other areas of Fujian have also made similar mistakes. They should all carefully examine their own work style and methods, and earnestly correct this kind of subjectivism and coercive command.

    闽侯县两个工作组强迫推广合式秧田
    使群众的生产和人民政府的威信都受了损失
    福建闽侯三区、十区派到东岐乡、高洲乡领导春耕生产的工作组，硬搬外区方法，强迫农民种“合式秧田”，盲目号召“密植越密越好”，使群众的生产蒙受了损失。
    春耕开始时，这个区的工作组到东岐乡领导生产。工作组为了改进农业技术，号召农民今年种植四尺宽、中间留一尺、两边做小田塍的“合式秧田”，采用株距九寸的“小株密植”方法。该地靠近闽江口，海风比较厉害，当地农民怕做小畦秧苗容易受海风侵袭，又怕小田塍不好排水灌水，一遇连日下雨就会霉烂，因此都不愿意做“合式秧田”。工作组对群众的思想顾虑没有深入了解，没有想办法解除。他们为了急于完成任务，就在农民代表会和互助组长会上简单地介绍了外地做合式秧田的情况，又制了一把四尺长的竹尺挂在桥头路口，旁边贴一张布告，要农民一律按这个尺度做合式秧田。然后，工作组就到田里监督农民照样做。有一个农民，因为他播种最早，没有按四尺宽标准做秧田，也没做小田塍，乡政府认为这是一个“教育群众的典型”事例，就把这个农民叫到乡政府里，要他保证别人都做好合式秧田，否则要他负责；并且强迫他接受后才具保释放。在工作组的威胁和监视下，多数群众不敢再提意见；就勉强做了合式秧田。秧田播种后几天，恰巧赶上寒潮侵袭，气候骤冷，同时阴雨连绵；再加群众虽然种植了合式秧田，但是仍采取旧式的管理秧田方法，没有经常排水灌水。这样一来，加做了小田塍的秧田里的水被圈死了，普遍发生了烂秧现象。这情况发生后，工作组干部没有采取有效办法领导群众抢救，仅消极地号召群众用插小株的办法克服秧苗不足的困难。群众蒙受损失以后，非常不满，埋怨工作组不了解当地情况，硬搬外地的办法。此后，区乡干部放松对这个工作的领导，群众自发地补下了一千多斤种籽，又奔往外地买了一些稻秧。就是这样，全乡还有六亩多双季稻本田因缺秧而荒芜一季。为了这件事，群众对干部再也不肯信任了。工作组的同志走过桥头路口时，群众冷言冷语地讽刺说：“合式秧田做得好，家家户户没秧插。”发生了这次事件以后，工作组仍然没有很好地接受教训。在领导群众插秧时，他们又不顾群众对于密植晚秧会被早稻倒伏压死的顾虑，又制了一把五尺四寸长的竹尺挂在桥头路口，旁边还贴一张叫农民按这个尺子插六株（当地原来习惯是六尺宽插六株）的条子。群众对区工作组干部的话已不相信，再加怕受损失，不敢冒险试验，因此不接受密植。有些农民说：咱们每人只有五分八土地（当地土地改革平均数），密植坏了怎么办？
    闽侯县第十区高洲乡工作组为了完成推广合式秧田和密植的“任务”，发动群众挑战应战，提出“稀播越稀越好，密植越密越好”的口号，结果有的一亩秧田只播五十斤种子，有的间作田密植的株行距只有四五寸。乡干部和群众都想不通，提心吊胆。当工作组长要走时，乡干部和群众拉着他不肯放，说：“你走不得，等我们收割以后再走吧！”
    这样做不但使群众受了损失，也使党和政府在群众中的威信受了损失。
    福建其他地区也有不少干部犯了类似的错误，他们都应当很好地检查一下自己的工作作风和工作方法，切实改正这种主观主义、强迫命令的做法。
