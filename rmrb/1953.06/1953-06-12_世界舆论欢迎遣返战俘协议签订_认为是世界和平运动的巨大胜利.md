Xinhua News Agency, Prague, June 11th: Newspapers in Prague, Czechoslovakia, Budapest, Hungary, Bucharest, Romania, and other people's democratic countries in Europe, all published the communique issued by the Korean-Chinese delegation to the Korean Armistice Negotiations on the agreement on the repatriation of prisoners of war on the 9th.

The Czechoslovakian "Red Rights" and "People's Defense" newspapers, as well as the Hungarian "Free People's Daily," all published excerpts of the "People's Daily" editorial of June 9th, "Opening the Road to a Peaceful Solution of the Korean Question," on the 10th.

Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, June 11th: Professor Walter Friedrich, President of the German Academy of Sciences and Chairman of the German Peace Committee, met with a reporter from the German News Agency to discuss his thoughts after hearing about the signing of the agreement on the repatriation of prisoners of war in Panmunjom. He said, "Like all peace-loving people in the world, I also breathed a deep sigh of relief. Because the signing of this agreement can facilitate the armistice in Korea that we have longed for, and end the bloodshed and cruelty that is contrary to humanitarianism." He then spoke of the importance of this matter, saying, "I believe that the signing of this agreement is clearly a victory for an idea that the world peace movement has put forward from the very beginning, which is: all outstanding issues and disputes can be resolved through peaceful negotiations instead of weapons. The signing of this agreement proves the correctness of the proposals put forward by the World Peace Council and is also a victory for the world peace movement." He pointed out that the negotiations were initially made possible thanks to the Soviet government.

According to Xinhua News Agency: All democratic newspapers in Berlin continued to publish the news of the agreement reached on the prisoner of war issue in Panmunjom on the front page on the 10th.

"Neues Deutschland" published an editorial entitled "The Road of Negotiation is the Road to Success," saying, "The whole world welcomes this news with extreme satisfaction. The armistice agreement to be concluded soon will have great historical significance." The newspaper continued, "The agreement in Panmunjom is a clear victory for the forces in the world that advocate resolving all international disputes through negotiation... Despite attempts to delay and provoke, the agreement was reached, which proves that negotiation is better than war—whether it is a cold war or a hot war." The newspaper concluded, "What is urgently needed now is for all democratic and national forces of the German people to unite in a powerful movement to fight for a peaceful resolution of the German question."

"Berliner Zeitung"'s editorial believes that the Korean ceasefire is of worldwide significance, saying, "The Korean ceasefire is a victory for the people of the whole world, a victory for the powerful world peace front over the warmongers." The editorial said, "After the ceasefire, it is necessary to achieve peace."

Xinhua News Agency, Prague, June 11th: The New York "Daily Worker"'s editorial on the 5th spoke of the imminent Korean armistice, saying, "The forces of peace in the world—of which the American people are a part—are about to win a great victory." The editorial also said that they were able to shatter the plans of the American rulers to expand the war and obstruct the armistice.

The editorial continued, "Since a Korean ceasefire is within reach, the American people should step up their demands for the Eisenhower administration to change its current foreign policy to one of negotiating with the Soviet Union and developing world trade."

The editorial called on the American people, especially the workers, to demand that "when Eisenhower goes to Bermuda, he should not go to plan how to collude against the Soviet Union and China, but to plan to hold negotiations with Malenkov for the benefit of all."

The editorial called for a "drastic reduction in wasteful arms expansion plans, reduction of taxes on consumers and wage earners, and the development of large-scale East-West trade that is beneficial to all countries."

The editorial concluded, "Peace is winning. Now our responsibility is to expand peace, end all cold and hot wars, and encourage the United States to adopt economic, social, and political programs that are sufficient to strengthen democracy, eliminate McCarthyites, and improve the living standards of all the people."

According to Xinhua News Agency: Parisian newspapers welcomed the agreement reached in Korea on the repatriation of prisoners of war and predicted an imminent ceasefire.

"L'Humanité" pointed out, "After this agreement, a ceasefire in Korea does not seem too far away." It also said, "This once again proves that it is impossible to oppose people who are determined to defend their freedom."

"Libération" emphasized that the news of the agreement reached "has brought widespread satisfaction to people in various capitals."

Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, June 11th: Newspapers in Delhi all published the news of the agreement reached on the prisoner of war issue in the Korean armistice negotiations on the front page on June 9th and published commentaries. The "Hindustan Times" said in an editorial, "The whole world will breathe a sigh of relief upon hearing this news, and all parts of the world will believe that this not only eliminates the danger of a larger-scale war in the Far East, but will also ease the tense international situation around the world, and avoid the possibility of a third world war for a considerable period of time."

The "National Herald" of Lucknow said, "The agreement on the prisoner of war issue has given the whole world a sigh of relief, and it is generally believed that the armistice agreement is almost equivalent to having been signed."

Speaking of Syngman Rhee's attempt to sabotage the realization of peace, newspapers in major Indian cities all said in their editorials with a tone of contempt that they never considered the Syngman Rhee government to be a truly representative government, so whether he has any right to represent the South Korean people is still very questionable.

The "National Herald" said in an editorial on June 10th: If the United States stops aiding South Korea and stops equipping the South Korean army, then Syngman Rhee's claim that he wants to fight alone to the Yalu River to bring the entire Korea under his rule will make the world laugh.

    世界舆论欢迎遣返战俘协议签订
    认为是世界和平运动的巨大胜利
    【新华社布拉格十一日电】捷克斯洛伐克、匈牙利和罗马尼亚以及欧洲其他各人民民主国家首都的各大报纸，都在九日刊载了朝鲜停战谈判朝中代表团所发表的关于战俘遣返问题的协议公报。
    捷克斯洛伐克的“红色权利报”和“人民防线报”，以及匈牙利的“自由人民报”，都在十日摘要刊载了“人民日报”六月九日社论“打开和平解决朝鲜问题的道路”。
    【新华社柏林十一日电】德国科学院院长、德国和平委员会主席华尔特·腓特烈教授接见德意志通讯社记者，谈他听到板门店签订战俘遣返问题协议后的感想。他说：“像世界上所有爱好和平的人们一样，我也深深地松了一口气。因为这个协议的签订可以促成我们渴望已久的朝鲜停战，并结束与人道观念相抵触的流血和残酷行为。”他接着谈到这件事情的重要意义说：“我认为这个协议的签订，显然是世界和平运动从一开头就提出的一个观念的胜利，这个观念是：所有未决问题和争端都可以不用武器而用和平谈判的方式求得解决。这个协议的签订证明了世界和平理事会提出的建议的正确性，也是世界和平运动的一个胜利。”他指出，谈判最初之所以成为可能，应该归功于苏联政府。
    据新华社讯：柏林所有民主报纸十日仍在首页以头条刊载板门店在战俘问题上取得协议的消息。
    “新德意志报”以“谈判的道路是成功的道路”为题发表社论说：“全世界都极为满意地欢迎这个消息。随即就要缔结的停战协定将有巨大的历史意义。”该报继续说：“板门店的协议是世界上主张以谈判方式解决所有国际争端的力量的明显胜利……尽管有人企图拖延和挑衅，协议还是达成了，这证明谈判比战争好——不论是冷战也罢，热战也罢。”该报最后说：“现在迫切需要的是，德国人民的一切民主民族力量在一个强大的运动中团结起来，为了和平解决德国问题而斗争。”
    “柏林日报”社论认为朝鲜停火是具有世界性的意义的，社论说：“朝鲜停火是全世界人民的胜利，是强大的世界和平阵线对战争挑拨者取得的胜利。”社论说，“在停战以后，必需接着实现和平。”
    【新华社布拉格十一日电】纽约“工人日报”五日的社论谈到即将实现的朝鲜停战说：“世界上的和平力量——美国人民是这支力量的一个组成部分——即将取得巨大的胜利。”社论又说，他们能够粉碎美国统治者扩大战争和阻挠停战的计划。
    社论继续说：“由于朝鲜停火已是伸手可及的事，美国人民应该加紧要求艾森豪威尔政府把它目前的外交政策改变为与苏联进行谈判和发展世界贸易的政策。”
    社论号召美国人民，特别是工人，要求“艾森豪威尔到百慕大去的时候，不是去计划怎样串通一起以对抗苏联和中国，而是去计划为了大家的利益，与马林科夫举行谈判”。
    社论要求“大大削减浪费金钱的扩军计划，减轻消费者和薪金收入者的赋税，并发展对所有国家有利的东西方之间的大规模贸易”。
    社论最后说：“和平正在获胜。现在我们的责任是扩大和平，结束一切冷战热战，促使美国采取足以加强民主、扫除麦卡锡分子、提高全体人民生活水平的经济、社会和政治计划。”
    据新华社讯：巴黎各报欢迎在朝鲜达成的战俘遣返问题协议，并预测即将停战。
    “人道报”指出，“在这个协议以后，朝鲜停战似乎并不太远了。”又说：“这再一次证明了：要反对决心保卫他们的自由的人民是不可能的。”
    “解放报”着重指出：达成协议的消息“使各国首都人士普遍感到满意”。
    【新华社新德里十一日电】德里各报在六月九日都在第一版刊载朝鲜停战谈判在战俘问题上取得协议的消息并发表评论。“印度斯坦时报”在社论中说：“全世界听到这个消息都将松一口气，世界各地都将认为这不仅解除了在远东进行更大规模战争的危险，而且也将缓和世界各地紧张的国际局势，以及在相当时期以内避免了发生第三次世界大战的可能。”
    勒克瑙的“国民先驱报”说：“战俘问题的获得协议，使得全世界都松了一口气，一般人认为停战协定几乎等于已经签订了。”
    讲到李承晚想要破坏实现和平的企图时，印度各重要城市的报纸都在社论里以鄙弃的口吻说，它们从未认为李承晚政府是真正的代议制政府，因此他是否有代表南朝鲜人民的任何权利还很成疑问。
    六月十日的“国民先驱报”在社论中说：假若美国停止援助南朝鲜并停止装备南朝鲜的军队，那么李承晚扬言要单独打到鸭绿江去好使整个朝鲜都在他的统治之下，这种说法将使世界哄笑。
