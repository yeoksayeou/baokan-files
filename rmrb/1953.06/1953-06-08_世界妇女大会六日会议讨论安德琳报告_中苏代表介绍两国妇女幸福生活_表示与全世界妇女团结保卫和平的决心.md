Xinhua News Agency, Copenhagen dispatch, July 7th: The World Women's Congress continued its discussion on the first item on the agenda, "The Tasks of Women in the Struggle for and Defense of Women's Rights as Mothers, Workers, and Citizens," on the morning and afternoon sessions of the 6th.

Representatives from the Soviet Union and China spoke at the meeting, introducing the happy lives of women in the Soviet Union and China, which sharply contrasted with the scenes of oppression and suffering of women in capitalist countries, colonies, and dependent countries as described by their representatives at the meeting.

At the morning session, the first speaker was Maria Lamas, the representative of Portugal. She said that in Portugal, the vast majority of women do not have the right to vote. Their wages are only one-third or one-half of those of men. Organizations that study women's issues and defend women's rights are banned. Jonnette Jagan, the representative of British Guiana, described the tragic situation of women in Guiana and their struggle against oppression. She said that women in British Guiana work laboriously in the sugarcane fields for many hours every day, but each person earns only four US dollars a week.

Next, Elsa Mark, a German farmer representative, spoke about the free life of women in the German Democratic Republic. Heddis Jackslev, representing the International Women's Cooperative Alliance, congratulated the conference.

Li Dequan, the head of the delegation of the People's Republic of China, spoke and was warmly welcomed. She congratulated the conference on behalf of the Chinese people. She spoke about the remarkable achievements of the free Chinese people, the liberation of Chinese women, women enjoying completely equal status with men in all aspects of life, and the state's parental care for women, mothers, and children. Li Dequan concluded by saying, for the sake of peace, for the sake of human justice and maternal dignity, for the beautiful lives of children like spring flowers, let women all over the world unite more closely and move forward with the banner of peace held high!

Elly Alexiou, the representative of Greece, vividly described the tragic situation of women and children in Greece. She said that in Greece, women do the same work as men but only receive 60% of men's wages. Child labor is everywhere. In schools, some children faint from hunger. Greece has 380,000 orphans, and this number is constantly increasing.

Representatives from Jamaica, the United Kingdom, Norway, Canada, Brazil, Luxembourg, and Switzerland also spoke at the morning session.

At the afternoon session, Andreanna Christoforson, the representative of Cyprus, described the tragic fate of women in Cyprus. She said that we, along with women all over the world, oppose the wars being waged in Korea and other countries, and demand that the five major powers conclude a treaty of friendship.

The Soviet representative, Kukharenko, spoke and was warmly welcomed by the audience. She said: Millions of mothers are watching our conference, and the representatives from all over the world gathered in this hall will come to a common decision, which will inspire women in all countries to carry out more powerful struggles. She then talked in detail about the situation of women in the Soviet Union. She said that the Soviet system enables women to actively participate in creative labor. Millions of Soviet women are participating in social life. In our country, every man and woman has the right to guaranteed employment. Since the establishment of the Soviet government, the occupations of working women have undergone fundamental changes. Soviet women now manage factories and collective farms, they drive trains, tractors, and combines, they have discoveries in science, they conduct geological and archaeological research, and design tall buildings. Many talented Soviet women are engaged in literary and artistic work.

Women, no matter where they work or what they do, receive equal pay for equal work with men.

Kukharenko said that the Soviet government has shown extreme care and concern for mothers. Obstetric hospitals, large hospitals, clinics, and sanatoriums are widely set up throughout the country to ensure the health of mothers.

Kukharenko also talked about the participation of Soviet women in political life. She said that 280 women are representatives of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, which is more than the total number of women parliamentarians in all capitalist countries combined. About 2,500 women have been elected as representatives to the Supreme Soviets of various union republics and autonomous republics. More than 500,000 women are representatives of local, city, and district Soviets, accounting for more than one-third of the total number of representatives in these Soviets. Many women hold the posts of ministers and deputy ministers, and about half of the people's judges and people's assessors are women.

Kukharenko concluded by saying: Soviet women are equal members of society, and they do not cease to care about the situation of women in other countries because of this. They wholeheartedly support all those who are struggling for their own rights and are prepared to continue to fight with them. Soviet women dedicate all their strength and enthusiasm to the struggle for world peace. Therefore, the Soviet representative agrees with the demands put forward in the report and believes that these demands are completely practical. If all women, regardless of political views, religious beliefs, race, nationality, or social status, participate in the struggle for these demands, they will achieve great success.

At the afternoon session, representatives from French Guinea, Germany, Australia, Israel, and Czechoslovakia also spoke.

    世界妇女大会六日会议讨论安德琳报告
    中苏代表介绍两国妇女幸福生活
    表示与全世界妇女团结保卫和平的决心
    【新华社七日讯】据塔斯社哥本哈根讯：世界妇女大会六日的上午和下午会议继续讨论安德烈·安德琳关于第一项议程“妇女在争取和保卫妇女作为母亲、工人和公民的权利的斗争中的任务”的报告。
    苏联和中国代表在会上发言，介绍了苏联和中国妇女的幸福生活，这和资本主义国家、殖民地和附属国代表在会上所叙述的她们国家里妇女被压迫和受苦难的景象形成尖锐的对比。
    在上午会议上第一个发言的是葡萄牙代表玛丽亚·拉马斯。她说，在葡萄牙，妇女中的绝大多数没有选举权。她们的工资只等于男子的三分之一或二分之一。研究妇女问题、保卫妇女权利的组织都受到取缔。英属圭亚那代表琼尼特·贾干叙述了圭亚那妇女的悲惨处境和她们反对压迫的斗争。她说，英属圭亚那的妇女每天劳累地在甘蔗林中工作许多小时，但是每人一星期只挣得四块美元工资。
    接着，德国农民代表艾尔莎·马克发言，她谈到了德意志民主共和国妇女的自由生活。赫迪斯·雅克斯列夫代表国际妇女合作事业协会向大会祝贺。
    中华人民共和国代表团团长李德全发言，受到热烈欢迎。她代表中国人民向大会祝贺。她谈到了自由的中国人民所取得的显著成就，谈到了中国妇女的解放，妇女在生活各方面享受与男子完全平等的地位以及国家给予妇女、母亲和儿童的父母般的关怀。李德全最后说，为了和平，为了人类的正义和母性的尊严，为了孩子们春花一样美好的生活，让全世界的妇女更紧密地团结起来，高举起和平的旗帜前进吧！
    希腊代表埃利·阿列克休生动地叙述了希腊妇女和儿童的悲惨处境。她说，在希腊，妇女做与男子一样的工作，却只能得到等于男子工资百分之六十的工资。童工到处都可以看见。在学校里，有的儿童饿得昏倒。希腊有三十八万孤儿，这个数目还在不断增加。
    在上午会议上发言的还有牙买加、英国、挪威、加拿大、巴西、卢森堡和瑞士等国代表。
    在下午会议上，塞浦路斯代表安德伦纳·克利斯多福森叙述了塞浦路斯妇女的悲惨命运。她说，我们与全世界妇女一道反对在朝鲜和在其它国家进行的战争，要求五大国缔结友好条约。
    苏联代表库哈连科发言，受到听众热烈的欢迎。她说：千百万母亲的眼睛注视着我们的大会，在这个大厅里聚会的来自世界各地的代表们将得出共同的决定，这个决定将鼓舞世界各国妇女来进行更有力的斗争。她接着详细谈到了苏联妇女的情况。她说，苏维埃制度使妇女能够积极参加创造性的劳动。千百万苏联妇女正参加社会生活。在我们国家里，每一个男女都有有保障的工作权利。自从苏维埃政府成立以来，劳动妇女的职业已经起了根本的变化。苏联妇女现在管理工厂、集体农庄，她们驾驶火车、拖拉机、收割联合机，她们在科学上有发现，她们进行地质和考古研究，设计高楼大厦。许多有天才的苏联妇女在从事文学和艺术工作。
    妇女无论在什么地方工作，无论做什么工作，都和男子同工同酬。
    库哈连科说，苏联政府对母亲表现了极度的照顾和关怀，全国各地广泛设置了产科医院、大医院、临床诊疗所和疗养院，保障母亲的健康。
    库哈连科又谈到苏联妇女参加政治生活的情形，她说，有两百八十名妇女是苏联最高苏维埃的代表，这比全部资本主义国家妇女议员的总数还要多。大约有二千五百名妇女当选为各加盟共和国和自治共和国最高苏维埃的代表。有五十万以上的妇女是地方、城市和区苏维埃的代表，占这些苏维埃代表总数的三分之一以上。许多妇女担任部长和副部长的职务，人民法官和人民陪审推事大约有半数是妇女。
    库哈连科最后说：苏联妇女是社会平等的成员，她们并不因为这样就不再关心其他国家妇女的情况。她们衷心地支持一切为争取自身权利而斗争的人们，并且准备继续和她们一起进行斗争，苏联妇女把她们的全部力量和热情都贡献给争取世界和平的斗争。因此，苏联代表同意报告中所提出的要求，并认为这些要求完全是切实可行的。假如全体妇女，不分政治见解、宗教信仰、种族、民族和社会地位的不同，一致参加争取这些要求的斗争，她们就能取得很大的成就。
    在下午会议上，还有法属几内亚、德国、澳大利亚、以色列和捷克斯洛伐克代表发言。
