To our beloved Chairman Mao:

The Second National Congress of the All-China Youth Federation extends its respects to you!

The congress represents all youth of all nationalities, democratic classes, democratic parties, religious organizations, factories, mines, enterprises, rural areas, schools, institutions, armed forces, returned overseas Chinese, and all other fields, to offer warm and high respects to you – the great leader of the Chinese people and the most beloved mentor of the Chinese youth.

The youth of the whole country have boundless love and gratitude for you:

Because of your brilliant leadership, the Chinese people shattered the shackles of enslavement by imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, and transformed old China into new China.

Because of your wise leadership, the Chinese people were able to rapidly complete the restoration of the national economy and begin planned national construction, in order to gradually transform China from a backward agricultural country into an advanced industrial country.

History teaches us to always follow the Communist Party, and the banner of Mao Zedong will guide us continuously toward new victories!

The youth of the whole country have boundless love and gratitude for you:

Because of your loving care, we have obtained various opportunities for work and study, the opportunity to fully develop our talents, enjoyed full democratic rights, and are living a happy life of equality and friendship among all ethnic groups. An infinitely broad and vast future is unfolding before us.

Because of your kind teachings, you have helped us to get rid of the residual influence of the old system, clarified the new direction of our lives, and enabled the new moral qualities of Chinese youth to grow rapidly.

We deeply realize that only the Communist Party cares for and values ​​youth so much, regarding youth as a huge force for defending and building the country.

The feelings of loving the motherland and thanking the Party and the leader inspire us to respond to all the calls of the motherland and encourage us to be ready at all times to carry out your instructions.

The congress has summarized the youth work of the past four years, and we are now reporting to you: Chinese youth have contributed their strength in every step of the motherland's progress in the past.

However, the youth taught by you must not allow themselves any complacency or pride. Compared with the responsibilities we should bear for the motherland, we have still done too little work. Now the congress has decided on the main tasks for the future, calling on us to mobilize and unite the youth of the whole country to participate in the national construction cause, gradually realize national industrialization and gradually transition to socialism. We assure you: under the leadership of you and the Chinese Communist Party, the youth of the whole country will unite closely, step up production, work actively, study hard, and bravely participate in the great cause of defending and building the motherland and defending world peace. We assure you: the youth of the whole country will be your good students, loyally serve the people, and contribute all their strength to any work needed by the motherland.

We will definitely strive to live up to being called the youth of the Mao Zedong era, and strive to maintain the glory and happiness of linking ourselves with your name!

Dear Chairman Mao! The congress represents the unanimous wish of the youth of the whole country: to sincerely wish you good health! Because your health is the source of happiness and joy for the people and youth of the whole country.

Let us cheer for you, long live, long live, long long live!
