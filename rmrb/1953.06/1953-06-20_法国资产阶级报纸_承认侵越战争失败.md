Xinhua News Agency, June 18th: According to Vietnam News Agency on June 17th, the defeat of the French invading forces in Vietnam has caused many complaints and criticisms in the French bourgeois press.

    The Paris newspaper "Combat" admitted that the policies of the current French High Commissioner to Indochina, Letourneau, have failed. The paper acknowledged that the Vietnamese People's Army is very mobile and able to launch widespread offensives; the French army, on the other hand, is pinned down in bunkers and camps, "waiting for an offensive that never comes."

    Many newspapers criticized the French invading army's method of retreating to the Na San stronghold after their disastrous rout from northwestern North Vietnam in the autumn and winter of last year. The French military authorities, in order to cover up their defeat, boasted that holding Na San would contain the advance of the Vietnamese People's Army in the Northwest. However, "Paris-Journal" said on April 29th: "For the past six months, the ten battalions of French troops stationed at Na San in Son La province, North Vietnam, have been completely useless." Former French Chief of Staff General Ely, who had inspected Indochina, also published an article in the newspaper saying that Na San "cost a great deal" to France. He wrote: "One can ask: Is this a fortress or a trap?"

    The reactionary French press cannot hide the fact that the French troops cowering in mountain bunkers are constantly attacked by guerrillas, and they live in constant fear. A dispatch published in the Paris newspaper "La Vie Catholique Illustrée" wrote: Upon hearing a gunshot, three or four French soldiers would sit up on their straw mats, asking each other if the Vietnamese were going to launch an attack that night, or were just firing to "disturb" them. These remarks in the French newspapers reflect the French ruling clique's helplessness and frustration with the war of aggression in Indochina.

### 法国资产阶级报纸  承认侵越战争失败

    法国资产阶级报纸
    承认侵越战争失败
    【新华社十八日讯】据越南通讯社十七日讯：法国侵越军队的失败，在法国的资产阶级报纸中引起了许多怨言和抨击。
    巴黎“战斗报”承认，现任法国驻印度支那高级专员勒杜尔诺的政策已遭到了失败。该报承认，越南人民军很机动，能够广泛发动进攻；法国军队则被钉在地堡和营舍里面，“等待一次一直没有发动的进攻”。
    许多报纸抨击法国侵略军在去年秋冬自北越西北地区狼狈溃败后退守那产据点的办法。法军当局为掩盖它的失败，曾吹嘘据守那产对牵制越南人民军在西北地区的进军的作用。但是，“巴黎急进新闻”在四月二十九日说：“在过去的六个月，法国驻扎在北越山萝省那产的十营军队完全没有用处。”曾到印度支那视察的法国前参谋总长李维尔在报纸上发表的文章也说：那产使法国“花费很大。”他写道：“人们可以问：究竟这是一个堡垒还是一个陷阱？”
    法国反动报纸无法讳言：龟缩在山林中的碉堡里面的法国军队，经常受到游击队的袭击，他们天天在胆战心惊之中。巴黎“天主教证言报”刊载的一篇通讯写道：一听到枪声，三、四个法军就在草席上坐了起来，互相探问，究竟越南人将在夜里发动进攻，或仅仅是开枪“扰乱”而已。法国报纸的这些言论，反映出法国统治集团对于印度支那侵略战争的一筹莫展和烦恼。
