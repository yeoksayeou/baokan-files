The CCP Anguang County Committee Work Team Specifically Helps
Wang Zhanmin's Mutual Aid Team Use the "Standard Work" Method to Solve the Problem of Planting Order

The Wang Zhanmin Mutual Aid Team in Changle Village, Anguang County, Heilongjiang Province, is a permanent team with many years of mutual aid habits, but the contradiction of planting order has not been resolved for many years. This contradiction affects the development of production and the consolidation and improvement of the team. During the spring plowing last year, disputes over plows occurred continuously: At first, everyone was afraid that early planting would freeze the crops, and no one wanted to plant early; when the rain soaked the ground, everyone scrambled to plant, and the plows couldn't keep up, causing disagreements among the team members. Wang Zhanmin and Han Dianchen didn't speak to each other for a long time because of a dispute over the plow. The land of households without horses in the team was often planted late. For example, Sun Chengfa, because he didn't have a horse, other people's small seedlings had already grown, but his land had not yet been sown. During the summer weeding, weeding before the rain saved labor, was more efficient, and kept the land clean, while weeding after the rain was laborious and could lead to neglect. In the autumn harvest, contradictions often arose between cutting first and cutting later, and cutting before and after the rain. If it hadn't been for the increased grain harvest every year, this team would have already fallen apart.

Team leader Wang Zhanmin and village chief Wang Zhenguo (one of the team members) realized that the contradiction of planting order was a major problem, but they couldn't come up with a fair and reasonable solution. During this year's spring plowing, the team leader came up with a "luck of the draw" (i.e., drawing lots) method to schedule the planting order for each household. The method was to not distinguish between high and low-lying land, or whether it was suitable for planting or not; whoever drew the lot to plant first would plant first. This method didn't solve the problem, but instead lowered the team members' production enthusiasm. For example, Yu Zhanjiang said: "Last year, I didn't catch the rain to plant, and more than three *qiang* of corn were ruined, and no grain was harvested. Who knows how this 'luck of the draw' method will turn out this year?" Therefore, he didn't work hard. The team members raised objections to this method one after another. But how could it be reasonable? No one could think of a good solution. It happened that the CCP Anguang County Committee Work Team came to this village. They were there to promote the "standard work" method, preparing to solve the problem of rotation order within the mutual aid team. Because Wang Zhanmin's team urgently needed to solve this problem, they decided to start with this team first. The work team first summarized the problems that had occurred in the team in the past that were detrimental to production; and explained to everyone that the "standard work" method could improve labor efficiency, so it could appropriately solve the current contradictions; and explained the method of implementing "standard work" to the team members, so that the team members could carry out democratic discussions, use their brains to think of ways to solve their own problems. In the beginning, the team members' thinking was not clear, and they had "three fears." The first was fear of trouble. Team member Wang Wensheng said: "This is too verbose! In the busy farming season, there's no time to evaluate that stuff (referring to evaluating land work points). It's okay to suffer a little loss or gain a little advantage. Let's just make do with it. Don't think about such troublesome things!" The second was fear of rough planting. Team member Sun Chengcai said: "If we do that, everyone will just try to be quick, and can the land still be cultivated well? What if we can't harvest grain in the autumn? I'd rather do more work than do that!" The third was fear of exhausting the horses. Wang Zhanmin said: "Rough planting doesn't matter, but what if the horses are exhausted!" After two days of deliberation and discussion, everyone came up with ways to avoid these shortcomings, and only then were the above concerns eliminated. All team members agreed to implement the "standard work" method. During implementation, based on the specific situation that the team had no year-round work point evaluation habits and experience in the past, a phased trial method was adopted, and the standard work points for harrowing stubble land were first determined. The specific method was: The team democratically evaluated the standard work points for various crops on the stubble land in the team, based on different cultivation methods and the team members' personal requirements for quality, according to the specific conditions of land distance, ridge length, etc., and contracted it to the team. For example, Wang Zhanmin's two *qiang* of stubble land, the quality requirements were: stepping on the grids must wear *wula* (note: not wearing *wula* saves effort, but the stepping is not good), foot sockets must be connected to foot sockets, the roller must be rolled straight, the sowing width must be four to five inches wide, the sowing depth must be two and a half to three inches deep, and spot sowing and manure spreading must be even, etc. One *qiang* of this two *qiang* land is less than a mile away from home and is a large piece of land (twenty ridges per *qiang*). According to the above quality requirements and the specific conditions of this *qiang* of land, it was democratically evaluated to use 3.7 man-days and 2.6 horse-days. The other *qiang* of land is three miles away from home, and the plot is not very large (there are thirty-five ridges). Everyone evaluated it to use 4 man-days and 3 horse-days. The land of other team members was also assigned specific work points according to the specific conditions of their land, and contracted to the mutual aid team in a unified manner, and the labor force in the team cultivated it in a unified manner. Whose land to plant first and whose land to plant later was determined according to specific conditions such as whether the land was dry or wet. The extra work spent due to cultivation after the rain was borne by everyone, and the work saved was also shared by everyone. Each household handed in work tickets to the team leader, and the team leader uniformly distributed them to the team members according to each person's labor points. Everyone also stipulated that it was not allowed to abuse the horses, and whoever abused them was responsible.

After this method was implemented, it solved the contradiction that the work was inconsistent before and after the rain, and it could also strengthen the team's planning. Everyone knew their tasks for each season, and poor households could also plant their land in time. The contradiction of planting first and planting later was largely resolved. Therefore, the team members' enthusiasm for labor was also improved. In the past, the team started working every day when the sun came out and ate when the sun was setting, resting for nearly two and a half hours at noon, and only planted one *qiang* of land per day. After the implementation of the "standard work" method, the team members went to the fields every day before the sun came out and came back after sunset, resting only two hours at noon, worked hard, and could plant 1.3 *qiang* of land per day. At the same time, the quality of cultivation was also better than before. For example, Wang Liancheng used to not wear *wula* when stepping on the grids, but now he wears them. In the past, Li Weicheng sometimes did not spot sow evenly, but now he sows very evenly. Everyone cultivated the land very well. Team member Sun Chengcai said: "I have never seen crops planted so meticulously as this year. It would be strange if we don't harvest more grain in the autumn!" (Zheng Jizhou, Wang Xiuwen)

    中共安广县委工作组具体帮助
    王占民互助组用“标准工”的办法解决耕作先后问题
    黑龙江省安广县长乐村王占民互助组是一个有多年互助习惯的常年组，但多年来耕作先后的矛盾一直没有解决。这一矛盾影响着生产的发展和小组的巩固提高。去年春耕中就不断发生争犁杖的纠纷：起先大家都怕早种把庄稼冻坏，谁也不愿意早种；等到落透雨的时候，大家都争着要种，犁杖忙不过来，组员间因此有了意见。王占民和韩殿臣两人就曾因争犁杖，好长时间不说话。组内无马户的地常常总是种晚了。像孙成发，因为没有马，别人的地小苗都长出来了，他的地还没下种。在夏锄铲地时，雨前铲省工、出活、地干净，雨后铲费工，还要坐荒。在秋收中，也往往发生先割拉、后割拉、雨前割拉、雨后割拉的矛盾。要不是年年多打了粮食，这个组早已散伙了。
    组长王占民、村长王振国（组员之一）认识到这个耕作先后的矛盾是个大问题，但始终想不出一个公平合理的解决办法来。在今年春耕时，组长想了个“碰大运”（即抽签）的办法来按家排定种地的日程。作法是不分岗地洼地、该种不该种，谁抽着先种的签，就先种谁的。这个办法解决不了问题，反而使组员们生产情绪低落了。如于占江说：“我去年没赶上下雨种，瞎了三垧多苞米，没打出粮食来。今年这个‘碰大运’的办法谁知道能碰的咋样呢？”因此他干活就不起劲了。组员们对这个办法纷纷提出意见。但究竟怎样才能够合理呢？又都想不出一个好办法来。恰好这时中共安广县委工作组到了这个村，他们正是来推广“标准工”的办法，准备解决互助组内轮作先后的问题的。因为王占民组迫切需要解决这个问题，他们就决定先从这个组做起。工作组首先把组内过去曾发生的对生产不利的问题总结了一下；并向大家说明“标准工”的办法可以提高劳动效率，因此可以适当地解决目前的矛盾；又把实行“标准工”的作法讲给组员们听，让组员们开展民主讨论，开动脑筋想办法，来解决自己的问题。开始，组员思想弄不通，有“三怕”思想。第一是怕麻烦。组员王文生说：“这该多囉嗦啦！大忙天，那有时间评那玩艺（指评地工数），吃点亏、沾点光，对付着算啦，别想那麻烦事啦！”第二是怕种地粗糙。组员孙成才说：“要那么办，大家都图快，地还能弄得好？到秋天打不出粮来怎么办？宁肯多点工，也不那样干哪！”第三是怕累死马。王占民说：“种粗糙不算哪，还把马累死了呢！”经过了两天时间的酝酿讨论，大家想出了避免这些缺点的办法，才消除了以上顾虑。全体组员都同意实行“标准工”的办法。在实行的时候，根据该组过去没有常年评工的习惯和经验的具体情况，采取了按段试行的办法，先订了耲楂地的标准工。具体作法是：把组内耲楂地的各种作物，分别不同的耕作方法和组员个人对质量的要求，按地远近、垄长短等具体情况，全组民主评定出标准工数，包给小组。如王占民二垧耲楂地，质量要求是：踩格子要穿乌拉（按：不穿乌拉要省劲一些，但是踩不好），脚窝赶脚窝，压磙子要压正，播幅四寸到五寸宽，下种二寸五到三寸深，点种、摅粪都要均匀等。这二垧地中有一垧离家不到一里地，是大片（二十垄一垧）。根据上述质量要求和这垧地的具体情况，民主评定用三点七个人工、二点六个马工。另外那一垧地离家三里地远，地块还不大
    （有三十五个垄），大家评定用四个人工、三个马工。其他组员的地也都各按自己地的具体情况定出了具体工数，统一包给互助组，由组内的劳力统一耕作。谁的地先种、谁的地后种，按地干地湿等具体情况决定。因雨后耕作多费的工由大家负担，省的工也由大家分得。各户交工票给组长，由组长统一按每人劳动分数分配给组员。大家还规定了不许把马使坏，谁使坏谁负责。
    这个办法实行后，解决了雨前雨后费工不一致的矛盾，还可以加强小组的计划性。每一季节都有一定任务，大家心中有数，贫困户也能及时种上地。先种后种的矛盾大体上解决了。因此，组员劳动积极性也提高了。过去该组每天日头出来干活，日头将落吃饭，午间休息近两个半钟头，每天只种一垧地。实行“标准工”的办法以后，组员每天日头不出来就下地，日落后才回来，午间只休息两个钟头，干活紧张，每天能种一垧三亩地。同时，耕作质量也比以前强了。如过去王连成踩格子不穿乌拉，现在已穿上了。过去李维成点种有时点不匀，现在点得很匀。大家把地种的很好。组员孙成才说：“从来没看见庄稼种得像今年这么细致，到秋不多打粮才怪呢！”（郑济洲、王秀文）
