Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, June 21st: Our reporter Jiang Qingzhao reports: The people of northern Korea are expressing extreme indignation at the U.S. military headquarters' condoning of the Syngman Rhee bandit gang's "release" of large numbers of captured Korean People's Army personnel, sabotaging the agreement on the repatriation of prisoners of war. Zhang Gangfeng, an electrician at a certain factory, said: "Syngman Rhee is a puppet of the United States, and the Korean people have long seen through him; without the United States' connivance, Syngman Rhee would not dare to do this. The U.S. government cannot escape its responsibility." Lin Dadian, a pneumatic drill repair worker at a certain mine, said: "We will never tolerate the U.S. side's serious act of sabotaging the agreement. We firmly support Marshal Kim Il-sung and Commander Peng Dehuai's letter to Clark. The U.S. side should immediately send back all of our captured personnel forcibly abducted from the POW camps by the Syngman Rhee gang." An elderly woman, Pei Junyu, a family member of a Korean People's Army soldier, said: "We Korean mothers will never allow the United States and Syngman Rhee to forcibly use our captured personnel as cannon fodder for aggressive wars. We hope that mothers all over the world will urge the U.S. government to strictly abide by the agreement on the repatriation of prisoners of war and all agreements, so that the Korean armistice can be realized at an early date."

    朝鲜人民对李承晚破坏协议极为愤慨
    【新华社朝鲜前线二十一日电】本社记者姜庆肇报道：朝鲜北部人民对美军总部纵容李承晚匪帮“释放”大批朝鲜人民军被俘人员，破坏关于战俘遣返问题的协议的行为表示极大的愤慨。某工厂电气工人张岗凤说：“李承晚是美国的傀儡，我们朝鲜人民早就看透了；没有美国的纵容，李承晚是不敢这样做的。美国政府决不能逃脱它的责任。”某矿山风镐修理工人林大典说：“我们决不能容忍美方这种严重破坏协议的行为。我们坚决拥护金日成元帅和彭德怀司令员给克拉克的信。美方应该马上把李承晚匪帮用武力劫出战俘营的我方被俘人员全部送回去。”朝鲜人民军军属裴俊玉老大娘说：“我们朝鲜母亲们决不容许美国和李承晚把我方的被俘人员强迫充当进行侵略战争的炮灰。我们希望全世界的母亲都来督促美国政府严格遵守关于战俘遣返问题的协议和一切协议。使朝鲜停战早日实现。”
