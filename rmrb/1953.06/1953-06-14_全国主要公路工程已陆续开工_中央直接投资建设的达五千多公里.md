    Major National Highway Projects Commence One After Another
    Central Government Directly Invests in Over 5,000 Kilometers

    [Reported by this newspaper] Major highway construction projects across the country for new construction and reconstruction in 1953 have commenced one after another. This year's highway construction scale in our country is enormous. According to the central government's direct investment plan alone, 5,022 kilometers of highways will be newly built and reconstructed this year. This year, 38.6 million cubic meters of earthwork and stonework are to be constructed, 9.73 million square meters of pavement are to be laid, and 17,500 meters of bridges are to be built, including nine large reinforced concrete bridges with a total length of 2,500 meters, as well as 8,728 culverts. Currently, except for three highway projects that have not yet started construction, major projects across the country have commenced one after another. At the same time, route surveys of more than 8,000 kilometers in length will be conducted this year. According to statistics, the survey work for 1,787 kilometers of routes has been completed in the first quarter.
    This year's highway construction in our country, in addition to meeting the needs of national defense, particularly focuses on the opening up of routes in minority areas. The largest projects, such as the Kangding-Tibet Highway, the Xining-Yushu Highway, two highways in Sichuan Province, and four highways in Yunnan Province, are all being built for the development of minority areas. The construction of these highways will strengthen the unity among all ethnic groups in our country and promote the political, economic, and cultural development of various minority areas. People of all ethnic groups along the routes have successively reflected: "Where the highway is built, it brings happiness there."
    In order to adapt to the first Five-Year Plan that our country began to implement this year, and to further promote the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas and various regions, this year our country's highway construction focuses on the reconstruction and new construction of major economic routes.
    According to the current construction situation, several major highways can not only be completed on schedule, but may also be completed ahead of schedule. However, there are still some difficulties in several highways due to relatively backward design and preparation work, and active efforts are being made to remedy them. Currently, all employees of the transportation system are working hard to complete this year's highway construction tasks. The construction of more than 5,000 kilometers of highways this year is not only of great significance to our national economy, but also of great significance to the consolidation of our national defense and the development of our political and cultural construction undertakings.

    全国主要公路工程已陆续开工
    中央直接投资建设的达五千多公里
    【本报讯】全国各地一九五三年新建和改建的主要公路工程已陆续开工。今年我国公路建设的规模巨大。仅中央直接投资的计划，今年就要新建和改建五千零二十二公里的公路。今年要修筑土石方三千八百六十万立方公尺，要铺筑路面九百七十三万平方公尺，要建造桥梁一万七千五百公尺长，其中钢筋混凝土大桥九座，共长二千五百公尺，还要修建八千七百二十八道涵管。目前除了三条公路工程尚未施工外，全国各地主要工程都已陆续施工。同时今年又要勘测八千多公里长的线路，据统计，第一季度已完成了一千七百八十七公里线路的勘测工作。
    今年我国的公路建设，除了为国防需要外，特别着重于少数民族地区线路的开辟，其中工程最大的如康藏公路，西宁—玉树公路，四川省的两条公路，云南省的四条公路，都是为少数民族地区的发展而建造的，这些公路的建设将加强我国各民族间的团结，促进各少数民族地区政治、经济、和文化事业的发展。沿线各族人民纷纷反映：“公路修到那里，就给那里带来幸福。”
    为着适应我国今年开始执行的第一个五年建设计划，并进一步促进城乡和各地区间的物资交流，今年我国公路建设的重点，同时又特别着重于主要经济线路的改建和新建工作。
    根据当前施工情况来看，几条主要公路，不仅能按预定日期，而且可能提早完工。还有几条公路，因设计和准备工作比较落后，还存在若干困难，现正在积极设法加以补救。当前交通系统全体员工，正努力为完成今年公路建设的任务而奋斗。今年五千多公里公路的修建，不仅对于我国国民经济具有很大的意义，而且对于我国国防的巩固，以及我国政治文化建设事业的发展，也都是具有很大的意义的。
