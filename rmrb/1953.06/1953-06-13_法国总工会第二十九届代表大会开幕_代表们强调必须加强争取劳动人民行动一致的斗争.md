Xinhua News Agency, Paris, June 11th: According to TASS, the 29th Congress of the General Confederation of Labour (CGT) of France opened in Paris on June 7th, with 2,500 delegates attending.

    Gaston Monmousseau, the oldest leader of the French trade union, read the report of the CGT Executive Bureau. The report pointed out: Since the 28th Congress of the French CGT in May 1951, the consequences of the government's policy of betraying national interests have become more obvious. Military spending has risen from 171 billion francs in 1946 to 1,324 billion francs in 1953. Even according to official statistics, the price index has risen from 481 to 2,600. The budget deficit currently exceeds one trillion francs. According to statistics from last October, France has 600,000 unemployed and 2.5 million partially unemployed.

    The Marshall Plan has led to a decline in the production of textiles, leather, and other civilian industries, while military production has surged.

    The profits of companies producing for the colonial war in Indochina have increased 25 times from 1946 to 1951.

    The report then emphasized: One of the most important facts in recent years is that the masses of the people are increasingly resisting the policies of the French ruling clique, and the working class is unyieldingly striving for united action.

    In 1952, 1,800 strikes were held nationwide, of which 1,100 forced employers to agree to all or part of the strikers' demands.

    The report pointed out: The working class is not only fighting for economic demands but also for maintaining democratic freedoms and opposing the anti-democratic conspiracies of the French reactionaries. The report emphasized: The French CGT must do everything in its power to support the French people's movement for peace.

    The report particularly emphasized the importance of the working class's united action, stating that the CGT is prepared to cooperate as closely as possible with other trade union organizations in France.

    At the meeting on June 9th, CGT Secretary Jules Duchaussoy delivered a report on behalf of Alain Le Léap, who was illegally detained by the French authorities. Duchaussoy particularly emphasized that French dockworkers, sailors, metalworkers, and workers in other industries have waged heroic struggles to stop the wars in Indochina and Korea and to oppose the manufacture and transport of war materials. He called on all trade unions to actively participate in the preparations for the national conference for peace negotiations to be held in Paris on June 27th and 28th.

    CGT Secretary Pierre Le Brun spoke about the struggle plan to win national independence, social progress, and economic stability in France, emphasizing the importance of removing restrictions on trade with the East.

    CGT Secretary Olga Dognon gave a report on the situation of working women. She said: Approximately four million women are employed in French industrial sectors, accounting for more than 35 percent of the French proletariat. Women's wages are lower than men's, and they are often the first to be laid off. She emphasized that working women must be mobilized to participate more actively in the struggle.

    In the discussions, delegates emphasized that the struggle for united action of the working people must be further strengthened, and that the struggle to meet economic demands must be combined with the struggle for political rights and trade union rights.

    法国总工会第二十九届代表大会开幕
    代表们强调必须加强争取劳动人民行动一致的斗争
    【新华社十一日讯】据塔斯社巴黎讯：法国总工会第二十九届代表大会于六月七日在巴黎开幕，到会代表有二千五百人。
    法国工会最老的领袖加斯东·蒙慕梭宣读了总工会执行局的报告。报告指出：自从一九五一年五月法国总工会召开第二十八次大会以来，政府背叛民族利益的政策的后果已经变得更明显了。军事预算从一九四六年的一千七百一十亿法郎上升到一九五三年的一万三千二百四十亿法郎。即使根据官方统计，物价指数也从四百八十一上升到二千六百。预算赤字目前已经超过一万亿法郎。根据去年十月的统计，法国有六十万失业者和二百五十万半失业者。
    马歇尔计划使得纺织、皮革及其他民用工业生产下降，而军事生产却激增。
    为印度支那殖民战争进行生产的公司，其利润从一九四六到一九五一年增加了二十五倍。
    报告接着强调：近几年来一个最重要的事实是：人民群众越来越强烈地反抗法国统治集团的政策，工人阶级不屈不挠地努力争取一致行动。
    在一九五二年，全国举行了一千八百次罢工，其中有一千一百次罢工迫使雇主答应了罢工者的全部或部分要求。
    报告指出：工人阶级不但为经济要求而斗争，而且为维护民主自由，反对法国反动派的反民主阴谋而斗争。报告强调：法国总工会一定要尽全力来支持法国人民争取和平的运动。
    报告特别强调工人阶级一致行动的重要，并说，总工会准备和法国其他工会组织尽可能地密切合作。
    在六月九日会议上，总工会书记儒勒·杜沙代表被法国当局非法拘禁的阿兰·勒里普作报告。杜沙特别强调指出：法国码头工人、海员、五金工人及其他各业工人为争取停止印度支那战争和朝鲜战争、反对制造和运输战争物资，进行了英勇的斗争。他号召各工会积极参加六月二十七日和二十八日在巴黎举行的争取和平谈判全国会议的筹备工作。
    总工会书记皮埃·勒·布伦谈到争取民族独立、社会进步和法国的经济稳定的斗争计划，强调取消和东方贸易的限制的重要性。
    总工会书记奥尔加·杜纳德作了关于劳动妇女情况的报告。她说：约有四百万妇女受雇于法国工业部门，其人数占法国无产阶级百分之三十五以上。妇女工资比男子低，而且往往首先被解雇。她强调：必须吸收劳动妇女更积极地参加斗争。
    在讨论中，代表们强调：必须进一步加强争取劳动人民行动一致的斗争，必须把争取满足经济要求的斗争和争取政治权利、工会权利的斗争结合起来。
