Response to Readers' Criticisms and Suggestions in People's Daily
    Replies to Reader Opinions Regarding the Movement to Implement the Marriage Law
    The "Reader Letters Summary" column of this newspaper published some reader letters in February and March raising criticisms or suggestions regarding the work of implementing the Marriage Law. Some of the reply letters to these criticisms and suggestions have been published separately; the remaining reply letters are now published together below:
    A letter from the Minhou Prefectural Commissioner's Office in Fujian Province believes that the situation reflected by reader Zhang Bo in the February 17th report, that some village cadres in the prefecture have many concerns about publicizing the Marriage Law, is consistent with reality. After seeing the situation reflected by reader Zhang Bo, the Prefectural Commissioner's Office immediately notified leading cadres in various counties and districts to, before launching the movement to implement the Marriage Law, conduct full and correct education for village cadres in accordance with the spirit of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China's "Supplementary Instructions on the Work of the Marriage Law Implementation Month"; and to continue to organize and supervise village cadres to study during the movement. After this period of study, most village cadres have been able to initially dispel their concerns and their confidence in publicizing the Marriage Law has increased.
    The Xiangyuan County People's Government of Shanxi Province wrote a letter accepting reader Lian Zhishui's suggestion in the February 17th report that "when publicizing the Marriage Law, do not miss remote villages." The county has publicized the Marriage Law in Dongshanshang Village, which had never been publicized, by handling the incident of a couple committing suicide because they did not dare to divorce; and paid attention to this issue during the Marriage Law Implementation Month.
    The Fu'an County People's Government of Fujian Province wrote a letter accepting the suggestion of reader Liang Yaoju and others on March 4th, and adopted specific measures to eliminate the phenomenon of drowning infants. The phenomenon of drowning female infants was very serious in the county before liberation; and since the Marriage Law had not been systematically publicized after liberation, this behavior still occurred frequently. The county has discussed this issue at the People's Representative Conference at all levels when discussing the implementation of the Marriage Law, and decided to strengthen education on equality between men and women in the movement to implement the Marriage Law and in various meetings in the future, so that the barbaric act of drowning female infants will no longer occur.

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    对有关贯彻婚姻法运动的读者意见的答复
    本报“读者来信摘要”栏在二、三两月中曾发表了一些对贯彻婚姻法工作提出批评或建议的读者来信。对这些批评建议的答复信，有一部分已经先后单独发表；现将其余的答复信综合发表于下：
    福建省闽侯专署来信，认为二月十七日报上读者张勃反映该专区有些乡村干部对宣传婚姻法的顾虑很多的情况是切合实际的。该专署看到读者张勃所反映的情况后，当即通知各县区领导干部在开展贯彻婚姻法运动前，根据中共中央“关于贯彻婚姻法运动月工作的补充指示”的精神，对乡村干部进行充分的正确的教育；并在运动中继续组织和督促乡村干部进行学习。经过这段学习后，大部分乡村干部已能初步解除顾虑，对宣传婚姻法的信心有所提高。
    山西省襄垣县人民政府来信，接受二月十七日报上读者连治水关于“宣传婚姻法时不要漏过偏僻的乡村”的建议。该县已通过处理东山上村一对夫妻因不敢离婚而自杀的事件，在这个从未宣传过婚姻法的村子里宣传了婚姻法；并在贯彻婚姻法运动月中注意了这个问题。
    福建省福安县人民政府来信，接受三月四日读者梁耀驹等的建议，采取具体办法来杜绝溺婴现象。该县解放前溺死女婴现象十分严重；而解放后对婚姻法未经有系统的宣传，这种行为仍经常发生。该县已在各界人民代表会议讨论贯彻婚姻法工作时讨论了这个问题，决定在贯彻婚姻法运动中及今后各种会议上加强男女平等的教育，使溺杀女婴的野蛮行为不再发生。
