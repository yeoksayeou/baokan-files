    The Prime Ministers studied the latest report on the Korean armistice negotiations; according to observers from Reuters, they welcomed the signing of the agreement on the repatriation of prisoners of war. Observers pointed out that the Prime Ministers decided to declare their support for Western powers to hold talks with the Soviet Union as soon as possible.

    The "Observer" newspaper's diplomatic correspondent wrote on this issue: Some actions of the Americans in the Korean armistice negotiations and their attitude towards the Soviet Union were criticized by some at the meeting.

    Xinhua News Agency, June 9th: TASS, London, June 8th: All British Sunday newspapers commented on the international situation, emphasizing that the hope for a Korean armistice is greater than ever before.

    The "Observer" newspaper's diplomatic correspondent wrote: "The Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference showed an unusually consistent view on Eastern issues, including the Korean armistice negotiations. The Prime Ministers all believe that the new proposals from the Communist side indicate that the Chinese government genuinely wants to conclude an armistice agreement."
