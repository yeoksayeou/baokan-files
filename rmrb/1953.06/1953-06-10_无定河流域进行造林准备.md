    Afforestation Preparations in the Wuding River Basin
    Preparations for building a large-scale protective forest belt in the Wuding River basin in northern Shaanxi Province are actively underway.
    In order to cooperate with the work of controlling the Yellow River and reduce soil erosion on both sides of the Wuding River, Liang Xi, Minister of Forestry of the Central People's Government, accompanied by Soviet forestry expert N. N. Narakhomov, inspected the Wuding River basin in April this year. The Ministry of Forestry of the Central People's Government also dispatched a survey team to conduct a detailed survey of the Wuding River basin and formulated a plan to build a large-scale protective forest belt along the Wuding River.
    The Shaanxi Provincial Wuding River Afforestation Bureau has begun to prepare for afforestation in various ways. This spring, 13 state-owned nurseries have been established in Suide, Mizhi, Zizhou, Qingjian and other counties, cultivating 678 mu of seedlings, and cooperating with local farmers to cultivate 523 mu of seedlings, with an estimated total of 1.8 million seedlings. The seedlings are all black locust, Chinese toon, elm and other trees. These seedlings have now been sown and are growing well. In addition, farmers in various parts of the Wuding River basin have also carried out small-scale tree planting. In addition to some seedlings being supplied by the Suide Prefectural Commissioner's Office, most are solved by the masses themselves. According to incomplete statistics from Mizhi, Zizhou, Suide and other counties, farmers planted a total of 166,000 trees this spring, sowed 4,800 jin of *Caragana korshinskii* seeds, and planted 200,000 willow poles.
    At present, the Wuding River Afforestation Bureau has dispatched cadres to various places to conduct surveys of suitable afforestation land, and further prepare for autumn afforestation. (Xinhua News Agency)

    无定河流域进行造林准备
    陕西省北部无定河流域营造大规模防护林带的准备工作正积极进行中。
    为配合根治黄河的工作，减少无定河两岸的沙土冲刷，今年四月间，中央人民政府林业部部长梁希曾偕同苏联林业专家聂纳洛阔莫夫到无定河流域视察。中央人民政府林业部还派遣一个勘查队在无定河流域进行详细勘查，制订了大规模营造无定河防护林带的计划。
    陕西省无定河造林局已着手进行造林的各种准备工作。今春，绥德、米脂、子洲、清涧等县已设立国营苗圃十三处，育苗六百七十八亩，并和各地农民合作育苗五百二十三亩，预计共可育苗一百八十万株。树苗都为洋槐、椿树、榆树等。这些树苗现已播种完毕，生长情况良好。此外，无定河流域的各地农民也都进行了小面积的植树，树苗除由绥德专署供给一部外，大部由群众自己解决。据米脂、子洲、绥德等县的不完全统计，今春农民共植树十六万六千株，并播种柠条种籽四千八百斤，栽柳杆二十万根。
    现在，无定河造林局已派遣干部分赴各地进行宜林地调查，进一步为秋季造林作好准备工作。（新华社）
