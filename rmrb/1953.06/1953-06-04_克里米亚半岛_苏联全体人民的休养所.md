    Crimean Peninsula – A Sanatorium for All Soviet People
    By Te Lieqiakefu, President of the Central Sanatorium Institute of the Soviet Union
    Crimea is the largest peninsula on the Black Sea coast in the southern European part of the Soviet Union. The natural environment here seems to have been deliberately arranged: a warm ocean, picturesque peaks, vast grasslands, fairy-tale-like flowers and trees, ample sunshine, and fresh, mild air.
    In the first year of the establishment of Soviet power in Crimea, 1920, the Soviet government nationalized the courtyards and villas of the wealthy. A directive signed by Lenin designated Crimea for the recuperation of the working people. During the Soviet period, many sanatoriums, rest homes, and tourist stations were built. Before the Great Patriotic War, more than 280,000 workers received treatment and rest in Crimean sanatoriums and rest homes each year.
    The German fascist invaders destroyed many sanatoriums and rest homes in Crimea. In recent years, the Soviet government has spent more than 300 million rubles to restore the Crimean resort area. The number of working people resting and receiving treatment here is increasing year by year.
    Every year, thousands of Soviet workers spend their holidays in the beautiful sanatoriums and rest homes on the southern tip of Crimea. The resort areas of Yalta, Alupka, and Miskhore are the most famous on the island. Their characteristic is the special beauty that nature has endowed this peninsula with. The mountains slope towards the sea like a circular theater, blocking the cold winds from the north.
    Many new sanatoriums are being built in the Crimean resort area every year. The "Blue Bay" sanatorium was built in Simeiz for railway employees, a sanatorium was built in Alushta for the trade union of machine builders, a sanatorium was built in Alupka for chemical industry workers, and a sanatorium was built in Yalta for the power station department. A new sanatorium being built in Miskhore for timber and paper workers is a four-story courtyard with beautiful columns and railings sloping towards the sea. A large seawater bathing pool has been built in this sanatorium, where vacationers can bathe all year round.
    Many sanatoriums have also been established in Crimea for the young citizens of the Soviet state. Among them, a sanatorium with more than a thousand beds – "Artek" – is designated for Young Pioneer summer camps. This sanatorium has one hundred and fifteen different buildings: from dormitories to children's technology research stations. There is well-organized terrain therapy, various medical rooms, physical exercises, a reasonable diet, and a special work-rest system, all of which are exceptionally suitable for children's health. Children aged ten to fourteen come here for treatment.
    In the Alupka resort area, there is a standard children's sanatorium named after Professor Babrov, which has two hundred and fifty beds and is equipped for children aged three to twelve suffering from bone tuberculosis. Doctors and educators use a special system to correct deformities in children. Sunshine, air, and scientific medical systems free children from serious pain.
    On the coast of the shallow water harbor of the Black Sea is a famous Evpatoria children's resort area. There are more than three thousand sanatoriums, rest homes and hotels. The shallow water harbor and the famous "golden" bathhouse create ideal conditions for seawater bathing. In the resort area, there are many salt lakes containing mineral water and medicinal mud (slimy mud). A modern mud therapy center was established on the banks of Lake Manaks in 1931, which can perform two thousand treatments per day.
    On the banks of Lake Saki in western Crimea, there is a very famous Saki mud therapy area. The scientific director of this resort area for many years has been the famous Soviet surgeon Bulking.
    The climate in eastern Crimea is very different from that in the south. Its characteristics are less rain, low air humidity, and intense sunlight. There are many resort areas in this part of the peninsula, among which the Feodosia and Sudak areas are particularly distinguished. The climate of Feodosia is very dry and warm, and it is a famous sand bath, which greatly facilitates sun and air treatment and seawater bathing.
    Various different treatment methods are used in the various sanatorium areas of Crimea, and comprehensive treatment methods are used as much as possible. For example, in addition to well-organized rest and normal work-rest systems, quantitative sunlight therapy, air therapy, seawater bathing and mud therapy are also used here. Climate treatment is carried out all year round. In many sanatoriums, patients are in corridors and special pavilions all year round (such as aerial solariums that allow climate treatment to be carried out in all seasons).
    All medical methods, the treatment system for patients and vacationers, and all practical medical work in the resort area are based on the great Russian biologist Pavlov's theory about the influence of the external environment on the human body. Two national scientific research institutes have been established in Yalta, the central resort area of Crimea. All scientific staff members of these two institutes conduct field research in various resort areas, publish scientific works, and study various scientific treatment methods.
    The number of sanatoriums and rest homes in Crimea is increasing year by year. Thousands upon thousands of Soviet workers are willing to come here to spend their holidays, where they can rejuvenate and engage in effective labor for the construction of the Soviet motherland. (Attached picture)

    克里米亚半岛——苏联全体人民的休养所
    苏联中央疗养学院院长  特列恰科夫
    克里米亚是苏联欧洲部分南部黑海沿岸最大的一个半岛。这里的自然环境好像是故意安排好的一样：温暖的海洋，美丽如画的峰峦，广阔的草原，童话似的花木，充足的阳光，清新而温和的空气。
    在克里米亚建立苏维埃政权的头一年，即一九二○年，苏维埃政府便把有钱人的庭院和别墅收归国有。由列宁签发的指令把克里米亚划为劳动人民疗养之用。在苏维埃政权时期曾建立了许多疗养院、休养所和游览站。在伟大卫国战争以前，每年有二十八万以上的劳动者在克里米亚的疗养院和休养所里治疗和休养。
    德国法西斯侵略者毁坏了克里米亚的许多疗养院及休养所。最近几年内，苏联政府为修复克里米亚疗养区即支出了三亿余卢布。在这里休养和治疗的劳动人民一年比一年多。
    每年，苏联成千上万的劳动者在克里米亚南端美丽的疗养院和休养所度过他们的假期。岛上的雅尔达、阿鲁普喀、米斯赫尔等疗养区是最著名的。它们的特点是大自然赋予这个半岛以特殊的美丽。山陵像围成一个圆剧场一样向海洋倾斜，它挡住了来自北方的寒风。
    在克里米亚疗养区每年都有许多新的疗养院建立起来。在西米兹为铁路员工建立了“蓝海湾”疗养院，在阿鲁斯特为机器制造者职工会建立了疗养院，在阿鲁普喀为化学工业工人建立了疗养院，在雅尔达为电站部建立了疗养院。在米斯赫尔为木材工人和造纸工人兴建的一所新的疗养院，是一座有美丽的圆柱和倾斜向海面的栏杆的四层庭院。在这个疗养院里建筑了一个大的海水浴池，休养者整年都可在这里沐浴。
    在克里米亚也为苏维埃国家年青的公民建立了许多疗养院。其中专为少先队夏令营划出了一个有一千多个床位的疗养所——“阿尔台克”。这个疗养所中有一百一十五种不同的建筑物：从宿舍到儿童技术研究站。这里有组织得很好的转地疗法、各种不同的医疗间、体育锻炼、合理的饮食、特别的作息制度，所有这些都异常适合于儿童的健康。到这里来疗养的都是十岁到十四岁的儿童。
    在阿鲁普喀疗养区有一所以巴布罗夫教授为名的标准儿童疗养院，它有二百五十个床位，专为三岁到十二岁患骨结核症的儿童设备的。医生及教养者按照特种制度对儿童进行畸形矫正。阳光、空气以及科学的医疗制度使孩子们摆脱了严重的病痛。
    在黑海浅水港海岸有一个著名的艾夫巴托利亚儿童疗养区。这里有三千余个疗养院、休养所和饭店。浅水港及著名的“金色”浴场为海水浴创立了理想的条件。在疗养区有许多含有矿水及医疗用泥
    （粘泥）的咸水湖。一九三一年在马南克斯湖畔建立了一所现代的泥疗所，它每天可进行两千个治疗手续。
    在克里米亚西岸的沙克斯基湖畔有一个十分有名的沙克泥疗区，这个疗养区的科学指导者多年以来一直是有名的苏联外科医生布尔金克。
    克里米亚东部的气候与南部大大不同。这里的特点是少雨，空气湿度不大，日光剧烈。在半岛的这一部分有很多的疗养区，其中特别分出费奥多西亚和苏达克两区。费奥多西亚的气候十分干燥、温暖，是一个有名的沙浴场，这就大大便于进行日光治疗和空气治疗，进行海水浴。
    在克里米亚各个疗养区采用着各种不同的治疗方法，并尽可能采用综合疗法。比如除了组织很好的休息和正常的作息制度外，这里还采用定量的日光疗法，空气疗法，海水浴和泥疗法。气候治疗整年进行。在很多疗养院内病人整年都处在走廊和专门的亭子里（如使一年四季都能进行气候治疗的空中日光浴室）。
    所有的医疗方法，病人和休养者的疗养制度及疗养区全部实际的医疗工作，都是根据伟大的俄国生物学家巴夫洛夫关于外界环境对人体有机体影响的学说进行的。克里米亚的中心疗区——雅尔达设立了两个国立科学研究所。这两个研究所的全体科学工作人员在各疗养区进行实地研究，他们出版科学著作，研究各科科学治疗方法。
    克里米亚的疗养院和休养所的数目在逐年增加着。苏联成千成万的劳动者都愿意到这里来度过自己的假期，他们在这里养精蓄锐，以便为苏维埃祖国的建设从事有效的劳动。（附图片）
