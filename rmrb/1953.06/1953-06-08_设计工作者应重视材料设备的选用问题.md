Design Workers Should Pay Attention to the Selection of Materials and Equipment
Li Zhi

In basic construction, the supply of materials and equipment occupies an important position. In addition to the departments responsible for material supply doing a good job in supply, the design department also has the responsibility to correctly select materials and equipment in the design to reduce the difficulties of the supply department. In our unit, of the factory buildings that were redesigned and expanded from 1951 to 1952, less than one-third have been installed with all equipment and implemented the necessary technical measures so far. Most of them are still producing with incomplete equipment. For example, some heat treatment workshops have electric furnace equipment, but cannot be used due to the lack of high-temperature meters; the heat treatment heating tank designed in 1951 cannot be used due to the lack of heaters, so that the heat treatment process of many parts cannot be carried out, making the heat treatment workshop a difficult obstacle in production. The creation of this situation is related to the fact that designers did not fully consider the needs and possible conditions when selecting equipment and materials. Many designers start from important issues such as the selection of factory sites, the layout of factory areas, the quantity of construction area, and the amount of labor quotas, and study whether their designs are technically advanced and economically reasonable, which is entirely necessary. However, some people often neglect the selection of materials and equipment. They feel that after the major principles are determined, the specific design only needs to meet the production requirements technically, so they only pay attention to how to select materials and equipment from the technical requirements, and do not pay attention or rarely pay attention to whether these materials and equipment can be bought, whether they are cheap, and whether they will cause difficulties for the supply department. Some designers even mistakenly believe: "We have to adopt whatever is needed for production, and whether it can be supplied is the business of their supply department."

Some designers do not understand the situation of domestic products and design solely based on the information at hand. The Soviet national standards "GOST" and "OST" are complete compilations of materials and equipment. These designers, for the sake of convenience, adopt the "GOST" or "OST" standards in their entirety without asking about the specific circumstances. As a result, I-beams, angle steel, motors, etc. all adopt Soviet standards, and even screws, nuts, tinplate, and light bulbs adopt "GOST" numbers. Some simply use "GOST" even for cement. What is even more absurd is that when calculating the calorific value of coal, they do not try to understand the calorific value of domestic coal, but use the calorific value of coal from foreign materials. This has caused great difficulties for the supply department. Because the drawings only indicate "GOST" or "OST" numbers, the supply department does not understand their specific performance specifications, and therefore, does not dare to purchase domestic products.

Some designers have not paid attention to local materials. Although they have collected some domestic product information, they have not conducted analysis and research. They use Northeast red pine wood when designing factories in the South, and use Southern standard bricks when designing factories in the Northeast, which has also increased the difficulties for the supply department and wasted national funds.

On the issue of selecting materials and equipment, Soviet design experts have provided us with a good example. Soviet design experts believe that correct design should not only meet production requirements, but also be responsible for making the design possible to be realized quickly. Under the guidance of this advanced design thinking, Soviet experts attach great importance to the use of materials and equipment that can be purchased domestically in our country. They pay close attention to the work of collecting domestic product information. At the material exchange exhibitions held in several cities, they pay close attention to the industrial exhibition section. For all materials and equipment to be used in the design, they record in detail their performance, specifications, models, prices, manufacturers, etc. Sometimes, Soviet experts can even point out domestic products that our designers do not know. One Soviet design expert ran to several cities to solve the problem of the oil pump needed in a certain design. Later, he heard that old motors and old oil pumps were often sold on the Tianqiao stalls in Beijing, and he personally ran to the Tianqiao stalls to find them, but only found ordinary water pumps, not oil pumps. He tried to redesign it using compressed air to pump oil. Finally, during the design process, he finally discovered that a manufacturer in Tianjin could manufacture this oil pump. The spirit of Soviet design experts in dealing with materials and equipment has educated many of our designers. Our designers are not only technically responsible for their own designs, but also economically responsible for their rationality and the possibility of their realization. We must try our best to use materials and equipment that are of good quality and low price, that can be obtained locally, or that are easy to purchase in our designs.

Among the leading cadres of some design units, there is also an erroneous idea of simply being responsible for design, thinking that the design unit can complete the work as long as it guarantees that the drawings are designed. They are extremely unclear about the concept that the design agency should be responsible for building the factory completely so that it can carry out normal production. A leading cadre of a design agency, upon seeing that the designers of the unit had to modify the design because they could not buy equipment, actually said:
"Why are you meddling in those things? We'll be done when we've designed it. Let the supply unit or the factory find it themselves!" This view is completely wrong. When we cannot immediately unify the specifications and standards of materials and equipment in our country, this responsibility must be borne by the design agency itself. At present, although some advertising samples of domestic materials and equipment products can be collected, they cannot be fully used without actual investigation and analysis. Domestic products sometimes cannot be ordered due to the small number of manufactured products, or due to changes in the production tasks of the manufacturing factory. This situation cannot be clearly understood by a single designer alone, but requires the entire design agency to cooperate with the supply department to understand and study.

Design agencies should often educate designers with specific examples of waste caused by improper selection of materials and equipment. One designer was shocked to hear that it would cost 100 million yuan to buy a very ordinary machine tool, and that the proportion of foreign exchange in the equipment investment was also very high. He automatically checked the problem in the past of not having an economic accounting point of view in the selection of equipment: fearing that the designed factory would not be able to complete the production tasks, he always adopted more equipment, and always disliked using the old equipment accumulated in the warehouse and the equipment that could be manufactured in our country. In this way, a lot of national funds have been wasted. After being educated by this example, he began to pay attention to the issue of selecting materials and equipment.

Naturally, the supply department should also automatically provide the design department with the information on the materials and equipment that can be adopted. In the past, due to insufficient contact between the supply department and the design department, there was a phenomenon of accumulating a large amount of materials on the one hand and purchasing materials everywhere on the other hand. The supply department of a certain factory had a large amount of five-millimeter steel plates in stock, but a certain designer used six-millimeter steel plates for all of the outer shell design of the iron melting furnace. When the supply department was preparing the required materials according to the design requirements, it had to purchase six-millimeter thick steel plates everywhere. Finally, the designer accidentally discovered this batch of inventory materials and modified the original design. Some supply departments have mastered the specifications and quantities of state-controlled materials without notifying the design department, so that the equipment used in the design does not conform to objective reality.

The reason for the above situation is, first of all, that the supply department itself is unclear about the materials and equipment in stock, and lacks a scientific management system and allocation system. In the material inventory, there are only the names and quantities of materials and equipment, but there is a lack of detailed specifications, models, and performance. For the wide variety of materials and equipment required for basic construction with strict requirements, without scientific management methods, a muddled account is naturally difficult to meet the requirements of the design department.

Secondly, the supply department does not sufficiently recognize the close relationship between the department and the design work, and does not actively provide information to the design department, requesting the design department to use existing materials and equipment to save national property.

In short, further improvement of this situation depends on the joint efforts of the design department and the supply department.

    设计工作者应重视材料设备的选用问题
    立之
    在基本建设中，材料和设备的供应工作占有重要的地位。除了负责器材供应的部门应该做好供应工作外，设计部门也有责任在设计中正确选用材料设备，以减少供应部门的困难。我们这个单位在一九五一年到一九五二年内设计改建的和扩建的厂房，到目前为止，已经安装了全部设备并进行了必要的技术措施的还不到三分之一，大部分还是在设备残缺不全情况下进行生产。如有的热处理车间，有了电炉设备，但因缺乏高温计而不能使用；在一九五一年就设计好了的热处理加热槽，也因缺乏加热器而不能使用，以致很多零件的热处理过程无法进行，使热处理车间成为生产中一个不能突破的难关。这种情况的造成，是和设计人员选用设备和材料时，没有充分考虑到需要和可能的条件有关的。不少设计人员从厂址的选定、厂区的布局、建筑面积的数量、劳动定额的多少等重要问题出发，研究自己的设计在技术上是否先进与经济上是否合理，这是完全必要的。但有一些人对材料和设备的选用，却往往忽略了。他们觉得大原则肯定下来以后，具体的设计只要在技术上满足生产要求就可以了，所以只注意如何从技术要求上选用材料设备，不注意或者很少注意这些材料设备是否买得到，是否便宜，是否会使供应部门发生困难。有些设计人员竟错误地认为：“生产上需要的，我们就得采用，能不能供应得上，是他们供应部门的事。”
    有些设计人员，不了解国内产品情况，专凭手边资料进行设计。苏联国家标准“高斯特”及“奥斯特”，是一个完整的材料设备汇编。而这些设计人员贪图方便，不问具体情况，就全套采用“高斯特”或“奥斯特”标准。于是工字梁、角钢、马达等都采用苏联标准，甚至连螺钉、螺帽、白铁皮、电灯泡也采用“高斯特”的号码。有的索性连洋灰也用“高斯特”。更荒谬的是在计算煤的含热值时，不去了解国产煤的含热值，而用国外资料上的煤的含热值计算。这样就给供应部门造成了极大的困难。因为图纸上只注明“高斯特”或“奥斯特”号码，供应部门不了解其具体性能规格，因此，就不敢购买国内的产品。
    有些设计人员没有注意就地取材，虽说收集到一些国内产品资料，但没有进行分析研究。他们设计南方的工厂时，采用东北的红松木；设计东北的工厂时，采用南方的标准砖，这也就增加了供应部门的困难，浪费了国家的资金。
    在选用材料设备问题上，苏联设计专家给我们提供了良好的榜样。苏联设计专家认为：正确的设计，不只是要达到满足生产上的要求，而且要负责使这个设计有迅速实现的可能。在这种先进设计思想指导下，苏联专家十分重视采用我国国内购置得到的材料设备。他们很注意收集国内产品资料的工作。在好几个城市举行的物资交流展览大会上，他们对于工业展览部分十分注意。凡是设计中要采用的材料设备，他们就详细地将其性能、规格、型号、价格、出产厂家等记录下来。有时候，我们设计人员所不知道的国内产品，苏联专家竟能提得出来。有一位苏联设计专家为了解决某个设计中需要的油泵的问题，跑过好几个城市。后来听说北京天桥小摊上常有旧马达和旧油泵出卖，又亲自跑到天桥小摊上去找，但是只找到普通的水泵，而没有油泵。他就设法改用压缩空气压油的方法进行设计。最后，在设计过程中终于发现天津某厂家能够制造这个油泵。苏联设计专家这种对待材料设备的精神，教育了我们很多设计人员。我们设计人员不只对于自己的设计要负技术上的责任，并且，对它的经济的合理、与实现的可能也要负责。我们要在设计中尽量采用物美价廉、能就地取材或采购简便的材料设备。
    在某些设计单位的领导干部中，也存在单纯负责设计的错误思想，以为设计单位只要保证将图纸设计出来就可以完工了。他们对于设计机构应负责到把工厂完全建造起来能进行正常生产为止的观念极不明确。有一个设计机构的领导干部看到该单位设计人员因为买不到器材而要修改设计时，竟说：
    “你管那些闲事干啥呢？咱们设计出来就完事了，让他们供应单位或工厂自己去找吧！”这种观点是十分错误的。在我们国内尚不能马上统一材料设备的规格标准时，这个责任必然要由设计机构自己来担负。目前国内材料设备产品虽可以收集到一些广告样本，但如果不经过实际调查分析，仍然是不能完全使用的。国内产品有时因为制造数量不多，或者因制造的工厂生产任务改变，而不能订货。这一情况决不是某一设计人员能单独了解清楚的，而必需整个设计机构配合供应部门共同了解研究。
    设计机构应该经常以材料设备选用不当而造成浪费的具体事例向设计人员进行教育。有一个设计员听到说买一部极普通的机床需要一亿元，设备投资中外汇比例也很高，大吃一惊，自动检查了过去在选用设备上没有经济核算观点的毛病：只怕设计出来的工厂完成不了生产任务，总是多采用一些设备，而且总不喜欢采用积压在仓库里的旧设备和本国能够制造的设备。这样，就浪费了国家不少资金。经过这一事例的教育，他就开始重视了选用材料设备的问题。
    自然，供应部门也应该自动地供给设计部门可供采用的材料设备的资料。过去由于供应部门与设计部门联系不够，就造成一方面积压大量材料，另一方面又四出采购材料的现象。某厂供应部门存有大量五毫米的钢板，但某设计员竟在化铁炉的外壳设计中，全部采用了六毫米钢板。供应部门按设计要求筹措所需材料时，不得不四处收购六毫米厚的钢板。最后设计员偶然发现了这批库存材料，才修改了原设计。有的供应部门掌握了国家控制物资的规格数量，而不通知设计部门，使得设计中采用的器材不符合客观实际。
    造成以上情况的原因，首先是供应部门本身对库存材料设备心中无数，缺乏科学的管理制度及调拨制度。在材料清册中只有材料设备的名称和数量，而缺少详尽规格、型号及性能。对于基本建设中所需要的品种繁多要求严格的材料设备，没有科学的管理办法，一笔糊涂账，自然难以满足设计部门的要求。
    其次是供应部门对于本部门与设计工作的密切关系认识不足，没有主动地向设计部门提供资料，要求设计部门使用现有材料设备，以节省国家财产。
    总之，这一情况的进一步改善，有待于设计部门与供应部门的共同努力。
