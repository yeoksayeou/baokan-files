Experiences in Agricultural Tax Collection and Storage in the Former Pingyuan Province
Huabei Administrative Committee Finance Bureau

Editor's Note: In the past, accidents involving injuries and deaths of people and animals occurred frequently during the transportation of public grain, causing unnecessary losses to the state and the people. The former Pingyuan Provincial People's Government mobilized the masses, summarized experiences, and improved work, basically achieving the safe storage of public grain. With the summer tax collection approaching, we are introducing their summarized experiences for reference. Localities can study and emulate them based on their specific circumstances.

The public grain storage and transportation work in the former Pingyuan Province learned from the painful lessons of the Puyang County grain transportation incident in 1949. After years of improvement, by the autumn storage in 1952, it basically achieved safe storage. The improvement process of this work was also a process of strengthening the mass viewpoint, establishing the guiding ideology of safe storage, conducting in-depth and specific leadership, and gradually overcoming bureaucracy.

Based on the experience of public grain storage and transportation work in the former Pingyuan Province over the past three years, we deeply realized that each season's storage and transportation of public grain requires mobilizing hundreds of thousands of people, animals, and vehicles to transport hundreds of millions of catties of public grain in a short period. The time is near the "Sanfu" (hottest period of summer) in summer and near the "Sanjiu" (coldest period of winter) in winter. The risk of injuries and deaths of people and animals is serious in the sweltering heat and severe cold. However, as long as the Party and government leading organs at all levels attach great importance to this work and think of more ways, it is possible to gradually eliminate injuries and deaths of people and animals and achieve safe storage. In 1951, the former Pingyuan Province began to pilot the "Measures for徵雇运输 (zhēng gù yùnshū)Public Grain Storage and Transportation," replacing the wartime voluntary transportation method, thereby changing the past practice of average burden on labor and animal power and greatly reducing accidents involving injuries and deaths of people and animals.

To achieve safe storage, the first step is to establish the guiding ideology of safe storage. The guiding principle of safe storage in the former Pingyuan Province was clarified in the summer storage in 1952 after two years of work experience, and thoroughly implemented in the autumn storage in 1952. To establish the guiding ideology of safe storage: First, we must strengthen the mass viewpoint, inspire the sense of responsibility of leaders and cadres at all levels, and make every cadre deeply realize that "one animal is half of a farmer's property" and "one laborer is related to the prosperity and decline of a farmer's family." Safe storage is the common demand of the broad masses of farmers. Injuries and deaths of people and animals during the storage and transportation of public grain cause losses to the state and the people and will inevitably affect the normal relationship between the Party and the government and the people. Second, we must resolutely oppose the erroneous idea that "injuries and deaths of people and animals during public grain storage and transportation are inevitable" and the bureaucratic style of麻痹大意(mábì dà yì) negligence. Third, we must conduct in-depth mass education on safe storage, inspire mass wisdom, pool the wisdom and efforts of the masses, and jointly seek safety.

Secondly, under the guiding principle of safe storage, we must summarize the experience of the masses and formulate practical measures for safe storage. The main content of the "Measures for Public Grain Storage and Transportation" promulgated by the former Pingyuan Province in the summer storage of 1951 is:

First, we must conscientiously do a good job in village-level storage and transportation organization work. It is necessary to achieve strong manpower and horses, appropriate matching, and tight organization. (1) The advantage of the征雇运输(zhēng gù yùnshū) transportation method lies mainly in breaking the restrictions on the balance of labor and animal power in the wartime voluntary transportation method, and精壮(jīng zhuàng) strong people and animals can be selected and hired to participate in storage and transportation. In order to ensure that people and animals meet the conditions, a strict and meticulous inspection must be carried out. (2) With精壮(jīng zhuàng) strong and qualified people and animals participating in storage and transportation, it is also necessary to form a set of vehicles with a voluntary principle, combining合套(hé tào) animals and skilled drivers, preferably combining the original sets of mutual aid teams or合犋(hé jù) animals. Among them, there should also be a relatively skilled animal for driving the carriage. (3) With精壮(jīng zhuàng) strong and qualified people and animals forming a合套(hé tào) set of vehicles, a strong and tight organization is still necessary. Generally, each administrative village forms a transportation brigade. Under the brigade, each natural village or street forms a small team. Every three or four carts form a group. Each cart has one skilled driver and two helpers. The brigade, small team, and group are all equipped with big and small team leaders and group leaders, who are specifically分工(fēn gōng) assigned and have clear responsibilities. In order to strengthen the leadership of the brigade, the brigade leader is generally the main cadre of the village - the village chief or militia captain.

Second, we must conscientiously do a good job in road survey and repair work to ensure smooth vehicle traffic and driving safety. (1) It is necessary to universally survey and repair roads and bridges, especially after rain and snow. Bridges, embankment openings, strategic passes, and dangerous paths must be guarded by dedicated personnel. (2) To ensure vehicle driving safety, village cadres must be responsible for leading the round trip, and properly direct and take care of it. On the road, generally slow vehicles are in front and fast vehicles are behind, so as to avoid the rear vehicles rushing due to prolonged distance. Special attention should be paid to safe driving when returning empty. In previous years, two-thirds to three-quarters of the injuries and deaths of people and animals occurred when returning empty. This kind of negligence should be taken as a lesson. (3) The transportation mileage should be suitable for round trips on the same day. Generally, the mileage should not exceed thirty里(lǐ). The vehicle load should generally not exceed 80% of the normal load. There should be a distinction between frequently transported and infrequently transported animal vehicles.

(4) Pay attention to mastering the weather, avoiding transporting grain during the "Sanfu" (hottest period of summer) and "Sanjiu" (coldest period of winter). Therefore, the storage and transportation time should be appropriately tightened, but it should not be limited to突击(tū jī) rush. In case of rain and snow, transportation should be temporarily suspended, and transportation should be resumed when the weather is clear and the road is good.

Third, we must conscientiously do a good job in the grain station work, ensure strict planning, rapid grain collection, and considerate care. (1) It is necessary to formulate strict transportation plans. In the autumn storage of 1952, most counties signed transportation contracts with each village according to the county's overall storage and transportation plan. Both parties abide by the contracts and take the initiative. In order to avoid congestion of vehicles at the grain station and to facilitate the return of people, animals, and vehicles on the same day, the arrival time of vehicles in each village should be specifically divided. For example, villages 10 to 20 里(lǐ) away from the station should arrive at the station in the morning, villages 20 to 30 里(lǐ) away from the station should arrive at the station at noon, and villages within 10 里(lǐ) should arrive at the station in the afternoon. In addition, some counties adopt the method of dividing片(piàn) areas into batches and transporting grain every other day, so that people and animals have the opportunity to rest, and cadres can concentrate their efforts, which can also be promoted. (2) Organize a special warehousing team, composed of young, strong people with warehousing technology, specializing in weighing and warehousing. This can avoid accidents caused by民工(mín gōng) migrant workers doing their own warehousing due to unfamiliar technology, unfamiliarity with bearing heavy loads, and climbing high. Second, after the grain transporters, animals, and vehicles unload, only village cadres are left to handle the grain delivery procedures, and they can return in time. (3) Take good care of the grain transporters, animals, and vehicles. Each grain collection station and the main grain transportation roads should appropriately set up茶水(chá shuǐ) tea stations and medical stations, so that the grain transporters, animals, and vehicles can receive timely medical treatment when they are sick, and those who are not sick can rest appropriately. In winter, prepare fire-lighting wood for people and animals to keep warm, so as to avoid catching colds and getting sick. (4) Set up a special person to handle the payment of transportation fees. After the grain collection is completed, the transportation fees will be paid immediately, which can encourage the enthusiasm of the employed personnel. The transportation fee standard is fairly stipulated according to normal freight rates.

Finally, the leadership must attach great importance to this work, specifically deploy and conduct in-depth inspections to ensure the correct implementation of various tasks.
    
    I. Leaders should be responsible, take the initiative, and specifically deploy storage and transportation work. At the provincial level, leading comrades personally deploy at the Commissioner and County Mayor meetings, and the heads of the financial and grain bureaus of the special area and county participate to practically discuss the policy and specific implementation measures for safe storage. Each county should convene county people's representative conferences and district and village cadre meetings to explain the policy and specific measures for safe storage. In addition, meetings of transportation team leaders and skilled drivers should be convened to exchange specific experiences and plan implementation measures. Counties with little experience should first conduct typical trial runs, organize personnel responsible for storage and transportation in each district to visit, so as to absorb experience and educate cadres. Some counties are personally led by district chiefs during the first storage and transportation to discover problems and summarize experiences.

    II. Conduct a universal and in-depth inspection. The quality of storage and transportation work is uneven, but the requirement for safe storage is universal. To completely eliminate injuries and deaths of people and animals and achieve safe storage, it is necessary to ensure the safety of any corner, any person, and any animal. Any negligence is not allowed. Therefore, it is necessary to carry out a universal and in-depth inspection, and special inspections should be carried out in districts and villages with weak work, and personnel should be sent to provide specific assistance.

    III. Establish a system for approving transportation to strengthen leadership and prevent 自流(zìliú) uncontrolled flow. During the autumn storage of 1952, counties generally established a system of逐级(zhújí) step-by-step review and approval of transportation. Before each village starts transportation, the responsible district cadre must personally check and issue a合格证(hégé zhèng) certificate of compliance after concluding that it has reached a safe level, and report to the district and then the county for approval before transportation can begin.

    IV. Divide the responsibility area, implement a专责制(zhuānzé zhì) special responsibility system, specifically分工(fēn gōng) assign tasks, clarify responsibilities, and assign special personnel at all levels to be responsible for storage and transportation work. Each county should more specifically divide the cadre responsibility areas, designate which cadres to lead the storage and transportation work in those places, and be responsible for ensuring safety. Those who actively work hard to achieve safe storage should be commended in a timely manner; the situation should be immediately investigated and responsibility pursued for accidents that occur.

    V. Summarize experiences and lessons in a timely manner and constantly improve the work. Storage and transportation work is arduous, and the risk of injuries and deaths of people and animals is serious. Therefore, there can be no slightest negligence. Under the guiding ideology of safe storage, deeply educating the masses about safe storage will allow the masses to exert their wisdom. The experiences introduced above are all the creations of the masses. These experiences can show that safe storage can be achieved.

    前平原省农业税征收入仓的经验
    华北行政委员会财政局
    编者按：过去各地在运送公粮的过程中，不断发生人畜伤亡事故，使国家和人民遭受了不应有的损失。前平原省人民政府发动群众，总结经验，改进工作，基本上作到了公粮安全入仓。现在夏征即到，特把他们总结所得的经验介绍出来，各地可根据具体情况研究仿行。
    前平原省的公粮屯运工作，接受了一九四九年濮阳县运粮事件的惨痛教训，经过历年改进，到一九五二年秋屯时，基本上作到了安全入仓。这一工作的改进过程，也就是加强群众观点、树立安全入仓的指导思想、深入具体领导、逐步克服官僚主义的过程。
    根据前平原省三年来公粮屯运工作的经验，我们深刻体会到：每季屯运公粮，要在较短时间内，动员几十万人、畜、车辆，运送几亿斤公粮；时间是夏季近“三伏”，冬季近“三九”，酷暑隆冬，人、畜伤亡的危险性是严重存在的。但是，只要各级党政领导机关高度重视这一工作，多想办法，是可以逐步杜绝人、畜伤亡，实现安全入仓的。前平原省一九五一年开始试行了“公粮入库征雇运输办法”，以代替战勤义运办法，从而改变了过去劳、畜力平均负担的做法，大大减少了人畜伤亡事故。
    要作到安全入仓，首先就要树立安全入仓的指导思想。前平原省安全入仓的指导方针，是经过两年的工作体验，在一九五二年夏屯明确提出，在一九五二年秋屯才深入贯彻的。要树立安全入仓的指导思想，第一、必须加强群众观点，启发各级领导及广大干部的责任心，使每个干部都深刻地体会到“一头牲畜，就是农民半个家当”、“一个劳动力，关系一个农家的兴衰祸福”；安全入仓是广大农民群众的一致要求；在公粮屯运中发生人、畜伤亡，使国家人民遭受损失，势必影响党与政府和人民群众的正常关系。第二、要坚决反对那种认为“公粮屯运人、畜伤亡势所难免”的错误观念和麻痹大意的官僚主义作风。第三、要深入进行安全入仓的群众教育，启发群众智慧，群策群力，共谋安全。
    其次，要在安全入仓的指导方针下，总结群众经验，拟定切合实际的安全入仓办法。前平原省一九五一年夏屯所公布的“公粮入库征雇运输办法”的主要内容是：
    第一、必须认真作好村级屯运组织工作。要作到人强马壮、配套适当、组织严密。（一）征雇运输办法的优点，主要在于打破了战勤义运办法中人力、畜力负担平衡的限制，可以选雇精壮人、畜，参加屯运。为了保证人、畜合乎条件，须进行严密细致的检查。（二）有了精壮合格的人、畜参加屯运，还需要以自愿为原则，将合套牲畜、使车能手组成一套车辆，最好以平素互助组或合犋牲畜原套结合，其中还要有一个较为熟练的驾辕牲畜。（三）有了精壮合格的人、畜组成合套的车辆，还须有坚强的严密的组织。一般是每一个行政村组成一个运输大队，大队以下以每一个自然村或街组成一个小队，每三辆或四辆大车组成一个小组，每辆大车有使车能手一人，帮车二人。大队、小队和小组，均设大小队长和组长，他们都具体分工，严明职责。为了加强大队的领导，大队长一般都是由村的主要干部——村长或民兵队长担任。
    第二、必须认真作好道路勘查修补工作，保证车辆畅通，行驶安全。（一）要普遍地勘查修补道路桥梁，雨雪之后尤应注意。桥梁、堤口、要隘、险径须派驻专人护送车辆。（二）保证车辆行驶安全，村干部须负责带领来回，妥为指挥照料。路途行车，一般是慢车在前，快车在后，以免因拖长距离，后车急赶。空车返回时，尤须注意安全行驶。历年人、畜伤亡，发生在空车返回的占三分之二到四分之三，此种疏失，应引为教训。（三）运输里程以当日能从容往返为宜，一般里程不超过三十里。车辆载重量，一般不超过平时载重量的百分之八十，经常运输的和不经常运输的牲畜车辆，应有所区别。
    （四）要注意掌握天气，避开“三伏”“三九”运粮，因此，屯运时间应适当抓紧，但也不宜限期突击。如遇雨雪，应暂行停运，俟天晴路好，再行开运。
    第三、必须认真作好粮站工作，保证计划严密，收粮迅速，照顾周到。（一）要制定严密的运交计划。一九五二年秋屯中，大部县份由粮站根据全县屯运计划与各村订立运交合同，各自遵守，双方主动。为了避免粮站车辆拥挤，并便于人、畜车辆当日返回，应具体划分各村车辆到站时间，如距站十里至二十里的村庄上午到站，二十里至三十里的村庄中午到站，十里以内的村庄下午到站。另有部分县采用划片分批、隔日运粮办法，使人、畜有休息机会，干部可集中力量，也是可以推行的。（二）要组织专门灌仓队，由年青力壮有灌仓技术的人组成，专司过磅灌仓。这样一则可避免民工自己灌仓，因技术不熟，不惯负重登高而出摔伤事故；二则运粮人、畜车辆卸车后，只留村干部办理交粮手续，即可及时返回。（三）对运粮人、畜要好好照顾。各收粮站和主要运粮大路都适当设置茶水站、医疗站，在运粮人、畜有病时，可以及时医疗，无病者可以适当休息。冬季还要准备烤火柴，供人、畜取暖，以免受冻生病。（四）要设专人办理发放运资，收粮完毕，随发运资，可以鼓励应雇人员的积极性。运资标准，按平时运费公平规定。
    最后，必须领导方面高度重视这一工作，具体布置，深入检查，以保证各项工作的正确实施。
       一、要领导负责，亲自动手，具体地布置屯运工作。省级由领导同志亲自在专员、县长会议上布置，并要专区、县财政科长、粮食局长参加，切实讨论安全入仓政策和具体实施办法。各县召开县人民代表会、区村干部会，交代安全入仓政策及具体办法；又召开运输队长及使车能手会议，交流具体经验，规划实施办法。经验不多的县，还要先作典型试运，组织各区负责屯运人员参观，以吸收经验，教育干部。有些县在第一次屯运时，由区长亲自带领，以便发现问题，总结经验。
    二、要进行普遍而深入的检查。屯运工作的好坏是不平衡的，而安全入仓的要求则是无例外的。对任何角落、任何一个人、畜都必须作到保证安全的程度，才能完全杜绝人、畜伤亡，作到安全入仓；任何疏忽大意，都是不能容许的。因此，必须进行普遍深入的检查工作，而对工作薄弱的区、村更要特别检查，派员具体帮助。
    三、要建立批准开运制度以加强领导、防止自流。一九五二年秋屯时，各县普遍建立逐级审查批准开运制度，各村开运前，须经负责区干部亲自检查，认为已达安全程度，签发检验合格证，报区转县批准后才开运。
    四、要划分责任区，实行专责制，具体分工，严明职责，各级领导都指定专人负责屯运工作。各县要更具体划分干部责任区，指定那些干部领导那些地方的屯运工作，负责保证安全。凡是积极努力作到安全入仓的及时予以表扬；对发生事故的要立即查明情况，追究责任。
    五、要及时总结经验教训，不断改进工作。屯运工作是艰巨的，人、畜伤亡的危险性是严重存在的，因此不能有丝毫的麻痹大意。在安全入仓的指导思想之下，对群众深入进行安全入仓的教育，群众就会发挥他们的智慧；以上所介绍的一些经验，都是群众的创造。这些经验可以说明安全入仓是能够做得到的。
