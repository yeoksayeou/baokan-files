    Southwest Region State-Owned Factories and Mines Gradually Establish Planned Management

    State-owned and some local state-owned factories and mines in the Southwest Region are discussing plans and starting to establish planned management on a monthly basis. Starting in April, many factories and mines began to check and summarize the previous month's production, identify weak links and key problems, and then mobilize employees to discuss solutions and formulate production plans for the current month. This inspection and discussion of plans became more in-depth month by month. By the time of discussing the June plan, many workshops, work sections, and even production teams had corrected the shortcomings of simply discussing plan numbers and making empty promises. They were able to study solutions based on the characteristics and existing problems of their own units, and incorporate specific measures to improve technology and labor organization into the plan, and establish some necessary systems. Factories and workshops that did this saw continuous increases in output and quality, and a mass base for completing the plan. In Chongqing, more than 40 major state-owned factories and mines mostly completed the state plan in April. The Gejiu Tin Smelting Plant of the state-owned Yunnan Tin Industry Company completed the monthly plan two days ahead of schedule and exceeded it by 5.8% due to thoroughly mobilizing employees to discuss the April plan. Accidents were reduced by 40% compared to the average number in the first quarter. Some factories and mines failed to complete their plans month after month in the first quarter. After seriously inspecting production and mobilizing employees to discuss the plan in the second quarter, they solved many problems, and therefore completed the plan every month. The steelmaking workshop of the state-owned No. 102 Steel Plant initially changed the phenomenon of uneven production in May. Although the workshop exceeded the plan in the first quarter, the phenomenon of loose production in the beginning and tight production at the end of each month was very serious. When discussing the May plan, the workshop employees focused on outstanding problems such as furnace repair, furnace maintenance, and smelting technology, checked shortcomings, summarized advanced experiences, and incorporated the discussed solutions into the workshop and team plans. In order to overcome the chaos of mutual disconnection, the work sections also signed liaison contracts with each other. Due to the above measures, the implementation of the operation plan was guaranteed. The workshop began to change the phenomenon of uneven production in May, and each ten-day period was able to over fulfill the plan.
    The fact that factory and mine leaders and workers in the Southwest Region truly regarded the formulation and discussion of production plans as an important task only began in the second quarter of this year. State-owned and some local state-owned factories and mines in the Southwest Region have been carrying out production reforms since November last year. Many factories and mines have solved many key problems related to output and quality during the production reforms, and new records have continued to emerge in production, but they often failed to complete the state plan. This was mainly because the factory and mine leaders did not understand at that time that the purpose of production reform was to better complete the state plan, but instead separated production reform from planned production. This made the production reform somewhat blind, and the existing achievements could not be consolidated, forming a "monkey picking corn," picking one and losing one. After the Southwest Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Financial and Economic Committee of the Southwest Administrative Committee discovered the above shortcomings, they combined the spirit of the instructions of the various industrial ministries of the Central People's Government to seriously discuss the 1953 state plan, establish and improve planned management in their affiliated factories and mines, and led and supervised the factories and mines throughout the region to seriously discuss the plan month by month from the second quarter, and gradually establish planned management according to the different situations of the factories and mines.
    After seriously inspecting and discussing the plan in the second quarter, the production completion situation of many factories and mines gradually improved, and the direction and steps of production reform also became clearer. Some factories and mines with a relatively good working foundation have begun to rectify original records, focus on verification, and compile operational plans in conjunction with the inspection and discussion of monthly production plans. The state-owned No. 101 and No. 102 Steel Plants have begun to train dispatchers and prepare to establish dispatching organizations. The No. 101 Plant has begun to rectify material supply and transportation work. All state-owned factories and mines are preparing to spend a relatively long time in June to concentrate on in-depth discussions of the plan for the second half of the year, and revise or determine various quotas in conjunction with the verification work.
    However, the work of discussing plans and establishing planned management in state-owned and local state-owned factories and mines in the Southwest Region is extremely uneven. In most factories and mines, the discussion of plans is relatively perfunctory due to the lack of attention and in-depth leadership from the leading cadres. These factories and mines should seriously correct the above shortcomings when discussing the plan for the second half of the year in June.

### 西南区国营厂矿逐步建立计划管理

    西南区国营厂矿逐步建立计划管理
    西南区国营及某些地方国营厂矿正逐月讨论计划并着手建立计划管理。许多厂矿从四月份开始，按月检查总结上月生产，发现薄弱环节和关键问题，然后发动职工讨论解决，订出本月的生产计划。这种对计划的检查和讨论一月比一月深入。到讨论六月份计划时，不少车间、工段直到生产小组，已纠正了简单讨论计划数字、空泛提出保证的缺点，而能根据本单位的特点和存在的问题，研究解决办法，在计划中订出改进技术和劳动组织的具体措施，建立某些必要的制度。凡是这样作的厂矿或车间，产量和质量不断上升，完成计划有了群众基础。重庆市四十多个国营主要大型厂矿，四月份大都完成了国家计划。国营云南锡业公司个旧炼锡厂因深入发动职工讨论了四月份计划，全月计划提前两天完成并超额百分之五点八，伤亡事故较第一季度平均数字减少百分之四十。有些厂矿第一季度月月完不成计划，第二季度开始认真检查生产，发动职工讨论计划后解决了很多问题，因此每月都完成了计划。国营一零二钢铁厂炼钢场五月份初步改变了生产不均衡的现象。该场在第一季度虽超额完成了计划，但每个月内生产前松后紧的现象十分严重。该场职工在讨论五月份计划时，紧紧围绕着突出存在的修炉、护炉及冶炼技术问题，检查缺点，总结先进经验，把讨论出的办法订在车间和小组计划内；为克服互相脱节的混乱现象，各工段之间并订了联系合同。由于上述措施，保证了作业计划的贯彻执行，该场在五月份开始改变了生产不均衡的现象，每旬都能超额完成计划。
    西南区厂矿从领导干部到工人把制订和讨论生产计划真正当作一件重要工作，还是从今年第二季度开始的。西南区国营及部分地方国营厂矿从去年十
    一月开始进行生产改革。许多厂矿在生产改革中曾解决了不少有关产量、质量方面的关键问题，在生产中不断出现新纪录，但却经常完不成国家计划。这主要是由于厂矿领导干部当时还不了解生产改革的目的是为了更好地完成国家计划，而是把生产改革和计划生产分裂开来。这就使生产改革带有一定的盲目性，已有的成绩得不到巩固，形成“猴子摘包谷”，摘一个丢一个。中共中央西南局及西南行政委员会财政经济委员会发现上述缺点后，结合中央人民政府各工业部指示所属厂矿认真讨论一九五三年国家计划，建立和健全计划管理的精神，即领导和督促全区厂矿，从第二季度开始，逐月认真讨论计划，并根据厂矿的不同情况，逐步建立计划管理。
    许多厂矿在第二季经过认真检查和讨论计划，完成生产的情况逐步好转，对生产改革的方向和步骤也更加明确了。有些工作基础比较好的厂矿，结合检查和讨论每月的生产计划，已着手整顿原始记录，重点进行查定，编制作业计划。国营一零一、一零二钢铁厂已开始训练调度人员，准备建立调度机构。一零一厂已着手整顿材料供应和运输工作。各国营厂矿准备在六月份以较长的时间集中深入讨论下半年的计划，并结合查定工作，修定或确定各项定额。
    但是，西南区国营和地方国营厂矿讨论计划和建立计划管理的工作是极不平衡的。大多数厂矿由于领导干部对这项工作不够重视，不进行深入的领导，计划讨论得比较草率。这些厂矿在六月份讨论下半年计划时，应认真纠正上述缺点。
