Manager Zhang of Wuyang County Department Store
Lü Jianzhong

Comrade Zhang Zhong is the manager of the Wuyang County Department Store under the China National Department Store Corporation. This respected veteran of the Long March of the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army comes from a poor peasant background. A long and arduous life of battle prevented him from having the opportunity to fully study culture; enemy fire also damaged his eyes; but none of this prevented him from excellently completing the tasks assigned to him by the Party and the people. At the Wuyang County Department Store, he actively leads and relies on all the staff, correctly implements policies, and overfulfills tasks, and was rewarded by higher authorities last year.

Whenever higher authorities assign a task, Comrade Zhang Zhong first explains the task and policies clearly to all employees, allowing everyone to study and discuss them based on local conditions, so that everyone understands why the task must be completed and how to implement policies to complete the task; he mobilizes everyone to come up with ideas, make plans, and launch competitions.

The employees are very satisfied with Comrade Zhang Zhong's democratic style. They said, "Manager Zhang consults with us on everything, and we become more energetic as we work." Precisely because the masses are mobilized ideologically, the masses exert infinite wisdom and power.

The Wuyang Department Store wholeheartedly relies on and supports the cooperatives, making them its close assistants. Last year, the store established fixed contacts with more than 40 grassroots cooperatives. The department store sends people to participate in cooperative meetings to study and improve business with them. They send price lists to the cooperatives every five days and check prices every ten days to avoid price confusion. When new goods arrive at the department store, they promptly notify the cooperatives, provide them with popular and fast-selling goods, and distribute goods according to the quantity needed locally, so that the cooperatives do not accumulate funds and affect the supply to members. Comrade Hu Benhua of the store's sales team agreed on a delivery date with the Shidian Cooperative in the mountainous area. Despite heavy rain and muddy roads, he still delivered the goods on time. This is how they established a close relationship with the cooperatives. In the second half of last year, the department store's wholesale to cooperatives accounted for 26 percent of total sales.

The Wuyang Department Store also attaches great importance to leading private merchants. They implemented a system of designated personnel for designated goods and assigned areas of responsibility to contact private merchants, regularly understand their ideological and business situation, and send them order forms on time. In towns, they hold forums for merchants through the industrial and commercial administration departments, explaining policies, pointing out directions, and understanding the size of private merchants' profits, business conditions, what goods the masses need, and so on. In rural areas, they adopt the method of registering names and addresses, connecting customers with customers, and organizing joint purchases and sales. When customers come, they immediately publicize policies to the customers, explain the types, quality, and prices of goods, and establish contact with the customers, and then this customer connects with other customers; at the same time, based on the difficulties of rural peddlers such as having little capital and wasting time going to the city to buy goods, they promote rural peddlers to organize into joint purchase groups, sign contracts or establish fixed relationships with the store, pool funds on a regular basis, and take turns having one person go to the department store to wholesale goods (sometimes the store also delivers goods to them). The peddlers are very satisfied, and the number of households connected has increased from more than a dozen to more than 40. In this way, peddlers scattered in vast rural areas and small market towns are organized and united around the department store.

Comrade Zhang Zhong is also able to implement the instructions and policies of higher authorities according to the actual local situation. For example, before last year's Mid-Autumn Festival, the masses needed a large quantity of sugar, but because the wholesale starting point for sugar in state-owned stores was too high, most merchants could not afford to wholesale it, which affected the supply to farmers. After learning about this situation, Comrade Zhang Zhong convened a forum for merchants, further understood their actual operating capacity, appropriately lowered the wholesale starting point for sugar, which enabled 80 percent of the merchants to wholesale sugar at the department store, fully meeting the needs of the farmers.

In this way, the Wuyang Department Store last year united more than 300 local private merchants—accounting for 90 percent of the total—around itself, steadily controlled the market, and expanded the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas. Last year, the department store's wholesale of goods to private merchants reached 48 percent of total sales.

In order to improve business methods, Comrade Zhang Zhong often promotes all employees to learn from the masses. He takes the lead in conducting investigations and research in the market and has gone several times to observe the business methods of private merchants, returning to discuss them with the employees. Every evening, the various sales departments and sales teams separately check the achievements and shortcomings of the day's business and arrange the work for the next day. Every week, they combine life criticism meetings to study and improve business. At the end of each month, they convene an employee meeting to seriously summarize and arrange work. At the meeting, each department reports on how to implement policies and complete tasks, and then outstanding units and model individuals are selected and awarded red flags. Some units have experienced phenomena such as rejecting cooperatives and secretly selling on credit, which violate policies, and although they have overfulfilled their tasks, they cannot be rewarded.

This is how Comrade Zhang Zhong has inspired the work enthusiasm of all employees. Last year, their sales target was 9 billion yuan (later temporarily increased to 10.9 billion yuan), but they completed 11.4 billion yuan. After the launch of the sales competition movement focused on wholesale last autumn, the wholesale volume increased from 60 percent of total sales in August to 86.94 percent in December. Among them, bulk commodities accounted for about 60 percent. Therefore, they won the banner of "Implementing Policies and Overfulfilling Tasks" awarded by higher authorities.

Although they worked so enthusiastically last year and overfulfilled their sales tasks, due to the supply system management thinking, everyone could not fully and carefully calculate, resulting in a large amount of stockpiling of materials (inventory in 1952 increased more than double that of 1951), increasing commodity circulation costs, and resulting in a loss of more than 200 million yuan.

Starting from the first quarter of this year, the Wuyang Department Store implemented an economic accounting system and made many reforms. On the basis of strengthening investigation and research, based on the spirit of expanding commodity circulation, reducing circulation costs, and better serving industrial and agricultural production and the needs of residents, they initially determined funds, cleared inventory, changed transportation routes, and avoided the phenomenon of goods traveling back and forth. On the basis of democratic evaluation, they initially implemented a fixed-personnel and fixed-quota operation method. The entire store's staff was reduced from 72 to 57, and non-business personnel were reduced and salespersons were strengthened. They also initially understood the production and sales situation. This further strengthened the sense of responsibility and planning in the work of the employees. The purchase and sales plans are also more practical, and they have also focused on the operation of bulk commodities (the proportion of bulk commodities in the first quarter accounted for 61 percent). In the first quarter, the stockpiling and out-of-stock phenomena of commodities were basically overcome, and consistency between accounts and goods and consistency between accounts was achieved. The capital turnover rate in the first quarter has been shortened from one turnover every 133 days in the past to one turnover every 32 days, and commodity circulation costs have also been greatly reduced.

Although the Wuyang Department Store currently still has some difficulties and problems in objective and subjective aspects, the high sense of responsibility to the country and the people of Comrade Zhang Zhong and all the employees gives them the full confidence and strength to study and improve business, so they will definitely be able to continuously overcome difficulties and advance victoriously.

    舞阳县百货商店的张经理
    吕建中
    张忠同志是中国百货公司舞阳县百货商店的经理。这位令人敬爱的经过长征的中国工农红军的老战士，是贫农出身。长期艰苦的战斗生活，使他得不到充分学习文化的机会；敌人的炮火又损伤了他的眼睛；但是这都没有妨碍他来很好地完成党和人民交给他的任务。他在舞阳县百货商店，积极领导和依靠着全体职工，正确贯彻政策，超额完成任务，在去年曾得到了上级的奖励。
    每当上级布置下任务来以后，张忠同志首先就把任务和政策向全体职工交代清楚，让大家根据当地实际情况进行研究、讨论，使大家领会为什么要完成这个任务和如何贯彻政策完成这个任务；发动大家想办法，订计划，开展竞赛。
    职工们对张忠同志这种民主作风非常满意。他们说：“张经理事事和我们商量，我们越干越有劲。”正由于从思想上发动了群众，群众也就发挥了无穷的智慧和力量。
    舞阳百货商店全心全意地依靠并扶持合作社，使合作社成为自己亲密的助手。该店去年和四十多个基层社建立了固定的联系。合作社开会，百货商店就派人参加，和他们研究改进业务。他们每五天给合作社送一次价目，十天对一次牌价，不使价格混乱。百货商店来了新货，及时通知各合作社，给合作社配好货、热货，并根据当地需要的数量配货，不使合作社积压资金，影响对社员的供应。商店推销组的胡本华同志与山区的史店合作社订好送货日期后，虽然下了大雨，道路泥泞，也还是如期把货送去。他们就是这样与合作社建立了亲密的关系。去年下半年，百货商店批发给合作社的货物占销货总额百分之二十六。
    舞阳百货商店也很重视对私商的领导。他们实行了专人专货，分片包干的办法联系私商，经常了解私商的思想情况和营业情况，按时给他们送货单。在城镇，他们通过工商行政部门召开商人座谈会，讲政策，指出路，了解私商的利润大小，营业好坏，群众需要什么商品等等。在乡村，采取留名留地，以顾主连顾主，组织联购分销的办法。顾主来了，即向顾主宣传政策，交代货物种类、质量、价格，和顾主建立联系，再由这个顾主去串连其他顾主；同时根据农村商贩资金少，进城买货浪费时间等困难情况，推动农村商贩们组织成联购小组，和商店订立合同或者建立固定关系，按期集中资金，轮流由一个人到百货商店批发货物（有时商店也给他们送货），商贩很满意，由十几户串连到四十多户。这样，就把散布在广大农村和小集镇的商贩有组织的团结到百货商店的周围来了。
    张忠同志还能够根据当地实际情况来贯彻上级的政策和指示。例如去年中秋节前，群众需要大批食糖，但由于国营商店食糖的批发起点太高，商贩大都批发不起，影响了对农民的供应。张忠同志了解到这种情况，便召开商人座谈会，进一步了解他们的实际经营能力，适当降低了食糖批发起点，这便使百分之八十的商贩能够在百货商店批发食糖，充分满足了农民的需要。
    舞阳百货商店去年就是这样把当地三百多户——占总数百分之九十的私商团结在自己的周围，稳当地掌握着市场，扩大了城乡物资交流。去年全年百货商店批发给私商的货物达销货总额百分之四十八。
    为了改进营业方法，张忠同志常常推动全体职工向群众学习，他带头到市场上进行调查研究，好几次去观察私商的营业方法，回来和职工们座谈讨论。每天晚上各门市部和推销组分头检查当天营业的成绩和缺点，安排明天的工作。每星期结合生活检讨会研究改进业务。每月终召开职工大会认真总结和布置工作。会上，各部门汇报如何贯彻政策完成任务，然后评选出模范单位和模范人物，奖给红旗。有些单位发生过排斥合作社和暗中赊销等违反政策的现象，虽然超额完成了任务，却不能得到奖励。
    张忠同志就是这样把全体职工的工作热情激发起来了。去年全年他们的销货任务为九十亿元（后来临时增加到一百零九亿元），结果完成了一百一十四亿元。去秋开展以批发为主的销货竞赛运动以后，批发额由八月份占总销货额百分之六十，递增至十二月份的百分之八十六点九四。其中大宗商品占百分之六十左右。因此他们获得了上级奖给的“贯彻政策，超额完成任务”的锦旗。
    去年他们虽然那样热情澎湃的工作，并且超额完成了销货任务，但是由于供给制经营思想使大家不能全面的精打细算，大量地积压了物资（一九五二年库存比一九五一年增加了一倍多），增加了商品流转费用，结果亏了两亿多元。
    从今年第一季度开始，舞阳百货商店实行了经济核算制，做了不少的改革工作。他们在加强调查研究的基础上，根据扩大商品流转，降低流转费用，更好地为工农业生产和居民需要服务的精神，初步核定了资金，清理了库存，改变了运输路线，避免了商品来回旅行的现象。在民主评议基础上初步实行了定员定额的作业法，整个商店人员由七十二人减至五十七人，并减少了非营业人员，充实了营业员，对产销情况也初步摸了底。这就更加加强了职工们的责任心和工作中的计划性。进货销货计划也比较切合实际，并抓紧了对大宗商品的经营（第一季度大宗商品比重占百分之六十一）。第一季度基本上克服了商品的积压和脱销现象，做到了账货相符和账账相符。第一季度资金周转率已由过去的一百三十三天周转一次缩短到三十二天周转一次，商品流转费用也有了很大的减少。
    目前舞阳百货商店虽然在客观方面和主观方面还存在一些困难和问题，但是张忠同志和全体职工们的那种对国家对人民高度的责任感，使他们具有钻研业务、改进业务的充沛的信心和力量，因此他们也就一定能够不断地克服困难，胜利前进。
