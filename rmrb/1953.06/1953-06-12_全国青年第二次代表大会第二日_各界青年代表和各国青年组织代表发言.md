He pointed out that the youth of our People's Liberation Army fully support Comrade Rao Shushi's instructions and Comrade Liao Chengzhi's report on "Striving to Defend and Build the Motherland." We will certainly stand guard at the forefront of national defense, contribute all our strength to safeguarding the security of the motherland and national construction, and to defending the peace of the East and the world. We will learn from each other together with the youth of all circles of the country and strive to implement the resolutions of this congress.

    Worker representative Peng Songfu vividly described at the meeting how he created the quick method of teaching lathe technology under the care, encouragement and help of the Communist Party organization and the comrade Party members. He also told of his painful life before liberation. He gratefully said: For the more beautiful and happier future of our motherland, we young workers must further strengthen our political and cultural studies, improve our technical level, better learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, and train more skilled technical workers for the motherland at a faster pace, and devote ourselves to the great national production and construction. Yu Baogang, a technician from the Anshan Iron and Steel Works, representative of young technicians, provided an example of close cooperation between technicians and workers in his speech. He said: In order to cooperate closely with the workers and study together, I often took the initiative to approach the workers, participate in their meetings, help them take notes, and when they were busy at work, I also worked with them. I taught them mathematics and drafting; they helped me master the operation. In this way, many workers became my good friends, which enabled me to master the operation and adjustment of the rolling mill within two months. He hoped that young technicians would learn with an open mind, constantly improve their technical level, actively participate in labor competitions, and work with the workers to complete and overfulfill the tasks assigned to us by the state.

We must unite with the youth of the whole country to complete the glorious and great task of defending and building the motherland. The speech of Wuleji Naren, the representative of the Mongolian ethnicity, was also warmly welcomed. He said: The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has steadily carried out various democratic reforms by implementing the ethnic policies of the Communist Party, Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government. Economic construction and cultural and health undertakings have been greatly developed. Now the youth of all ethnic groups in Inner Mongolia are learning, working, and laboring with unparalleled enthusiasm for the motherland's first five-year construction plan.

    Li Qingzhai, Deputy Secretary-General of the Wuhan Municipal Federation of Democratic Youth, introduced the experience of Wuhan City in organizing street youth to study and participate in various political movements.

Xu Guangyao, representative of literary and art circles, said: We young literary and art workers must strive to use our pens to artistically describe and express our great reality and the typical examples of heroes in our new era in our works, so as to encourage our people and praise every step forward of the motherland, and answer the requirements and expectations of the people of the motherland for us.

    The speech of Le Duc Chinh, Executive Committee of the Central Committee of the Vietnam National Salvation Youth League, was warmly welcomed by the audience. Le Duc Chinh pointed out: For more than a hundred years, the imperialists have used all means to divide the various nations of Asia in order to carry out their rule. Today, China has achieved complete victory, and the close unity between the youth of great China and the youth of Asia is an important force for smashing the shameless conspiracy of the imperialists. Le Duc Chinh narrated the great achievements made by Vietnam in the seven years of the War of Resistance Against France, and pointed out the important contributions made by the Vietnamese youth to the Vietnamese national resistance under the guidance of President Ho Chi Minh and the Vietnamese Labor Party.
