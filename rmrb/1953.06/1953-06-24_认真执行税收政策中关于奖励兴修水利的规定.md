    Conscientiously Implement Tax Policy Provisions on Rewarding Water Conservancy Construction
    Dou Zhan of the Agricultural Tax Department of the Central Ministry of Finance writes: At the end of February this year, Li Yigong, a farmer from Dongshiqiao Village, Qingyuan County, Hebei Province, wrote to report: When agricultural tax was levied in the village last year, farmers who dug wells on dry land were not given rewards in accordance with the North China Agricultural Tax Provisional Regulations, and the output was calculated and burdened according to the converted paddy field in the same year. The people's government's agricultural tax law gives certain rewards to farmers who build water conservancy projects, turn dry land into paddy fields, and increase production. Article 9 of the North China Agricultural Tax Provisional Regulations stipulates: "For those who increase the normal annual output due to the construction of water conservancy or other methods of improving land, and the expenses are raised by private individuals, the normal annual output will not be revised within five years; for those built by the state, the normal annual output will not be revised within three years. For those who repair abandoned wells and restore paddy fields, the normal annual output will not be revised within two years." This is beneficial to encouraging and promoting farmers to build water conservancy projects, improve soil, and increase production. Our Agricultural Tax Department immediately informed the Hebei Provincial People's Government of the situation reflected in Comrade Li Yigong's letter. After inspection, the situation reflected by Comrade Li Yigong was true. In addition to returning the over-burdened public grain to the household, the local people's government admitted its mistake at the mass meeting and explained the tax policy of the people's government, so as to avoid similar problems from happening again. This won the praise of the local farmers and played a certain role in promoting farmers to build water conservancy projects.
    At present, the people's governments in a few areas have not conscientiously implemented the regulations on rewarding newly built water fields in terms of taxation, which has increased farmers' concerns about building water conservancy projects. This situation is not conducive to the development of agricultural production. It is hoped that the people's governments at all levels will pay attention to checking and correcting the above situation; and it is hoped that the broad masses of farmers will assist in exposing such acts that violate the policy, so that this phenomenon can be corrected in a timely manner.

### 认真执行税收政策中关于奖励兴修水利的规定

专栏：读者来信摘要

    认真执行税收政策中关于奖励兴修水利的规定
    中央财政部农业税司窦展来信：今年二月底，河北省清苑县东石桥村农民李一工来信反映：该村去年征收农业税时，对旱地打井的农民没有依照华北区农业税暂行条例给予奖励，当年就按水地改订产量计算负担。人民政府的农业税法，对兴修水利、将旱田变水田而提高产量的农民，是给予一定奖励的。华北区农业税暂行条例第九条规定：“凡因兴修水利或以其它方法改良土地而提高常年应产量，其费用属于私人自筹者，在五年以内不改订常年应产量；属于国家兴办者，在三年以内不改订常年应产量。修理废井恢复水田者，二年以内不改订常年应产量。”这对鼓励、推动农民兴修水利、改良土壤、提高产量是有好处的。我们农业税司当即把李一工同志来信反映的情况转告河北省人民政府。经检查，李一工同志反映情况属实；当地人民政府除将该户多负担部分的公粮如数退还外，并在群众会上承认错误，说明人民政府的税收政策，以免今后再发生类似问题。这样做，博得了当地农民的赞扬，并对推动农民兴修水利起了一定的作用。
    目前还有少数地区的人民政府，对于在税收上奖励新修水地的规定没有认真执行，增加了农民对兴修水利的顾虑。这种情况，对发展农业生产是不利的。希望各地人民政府注意检查并纠正上述情况；并望各地农民群众协助揭发这种违反政策的行为，使这种现象能够及时纠正。
