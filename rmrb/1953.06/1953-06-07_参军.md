    Joining the Army
    Hao Shuanggui
    It was during the Third Revolutionary Civil War.
    One evening, my mother looked exceptionally happy. She busily opened the cabinet, took out my new clothes, and said to me, "Come! Let me put these on you." After I put them on, she looked me up and down, left and right, as if she was thinking: I must dress my child well, so he can meet the requirements when he gets to the district tomorrow. After looking me over, she said, "Very good! Not too small, not too big." I asked her, "Mom, are you willing for me to go fight old Chiang?" Hearing this, her face immediately became solemn, and she said, "Silly child! Why wouldn't I be willing? Have you forgotten? Have you forgotten that year when Chiang's bandit soldiers came and robbed all the grain from our house, and the whole family couldn't eat a single grain of rice, and you were so hungry that your hair fell out! Now you can go take revenge, how could your mother not be willing?" After hearing these words from my mother, I felt she was truly good. Just then, my younger sister, E'zhen, ran in from outside in a hurry, her hair somewhat disheveled by the wind, with a few beads of sweat on her face, holding a new towel and a new enamel bowl in her hand. I asked her strangely, "Whose are these?" Her eyes darted at me like a pair of small lamps and said, "Mom told me to buy them for you at the cooperative." I said to myself happily, "Mom really thinks of everything!"
    The things to take were almost all prepared, except for the pair of shoes made by the Women's Association that hadn't been brought over yet. It was late at night, and the people at home were still bustling about. My uncles repeatedly told me, "When you get to the army, listen carefully to the instructions of your superiors, and bring honor to the uncles at home." After midnight, people all went home to sleep, and I lay down in the room as well; but my mother was still baking the dry rations to take tomorrow!
    Lying on the bed, I tossed and turned, unable to sleep. I thought: Before the registration, I wasn't afraid of anything, except that Mom would cry, but I didn't expect Mom not only not to cry, but to be even happier than usual. It turned out that she understood better than anyone else, "We won't have good days unless we defeat Chiang Kai-shek." After Mom finished baking the dry rations, she quietly walked to the side of my bed. "Gui!" she called me softly, and handed me a piece of dry ration. She sat beside my pillow and said kindly, "Eat it! Child! After eating this dry ration, go out there and fiercely fight Chiang Kai-shek." When she said the words "fiercely fight Chiang Kai-shek," she spoke with particular force. Although it was dark in the room, and I couldn't see her face, I could tell that she was saying it through gritted teeth. Hearing her words, I became even more excited and even more unable to sleep; so I sat up and stretched out my fist, as if swearing an oath to Mom, "Mom! I will definitely remember your words!"
    The next morning, at the crack of dawn, the gongs and drums on the street started to clang and bang. People came to my house in droves. The village chief chose a good horse in the village, decorated with red flowers from head to tail, with a new colorful blanket on its back, tied to the big locust tree in front of the door. The children and young girls shouted especially loudly. Sister-in-law Liu Er, who often told jokes, walked over and said, "How glorious is the person joining the army, the horse he rides is also so colorful, when my little Kui grows up, he will also join the army, and bring some glory to his mother as well." These words made people unable to hold back their laughter. After a while, the school teacher, leading two elementary school students, pushed through the crowd and squeezed to the door of my house, and pasted the couplets on the door frame: the right side read "Gloriously Join the Army to Fight Old Chiang," the left side read "Defend the Homeland and Enjoy Peace and Prosperity." They also draped a large red silk cloth over the door head, with three large flowers inserted in the middle, and a sign that read "One Person Joins the Army, the Whole Family is Glorified" was also hung on the stone pillars. After eating breakfast, the whole family saw me out the door, and I rode onto the big horse. The yangko team had already started to dance. Hey! Look at how lively it was! On the horse, people practically surrounded me completely. The elementary school students waved their small hands and shouted, "Goodbye, Uncle!" Some shouted, "Uncle! Older brother! Be sure to write to us!" The great-uncle next door, standing behind the horse's rump, holding his big smoking pipe, said with a smile, "I don't want anything else from you, just hope that you send back a lot of victory news in your letters." At that time, I was so happy that I didn't know what to say. Mom stood on the doorstep and called out in a loud voice, "Gui! Be sure to remember to write!" "I will!" I replied. The horse moved, people laughing, shouting slogans, and sent me all the way to outside the village.

    参军
    郝双贵
    那是在第三次国内革命战争的时候。
    一天晚上，我妈妈脸上显得分外高兴，她忙着把柜子掀开，拿出我的新衣服，对我说：“来！我给你穿上。”穿好以后，她上下看，左右看，心里好像在说：一定把孩子打扮好，明天到了区里使孩子能够格。看完了又说：“很好！不小也不大。”我问她：“妈，我去打老蒋你愿意吗？”她听了，脸上马上变得很庄严，她说：“傻孩子！为啥不愿意，难道你忘了吗？你忘了那年蒋匪军来了，把咱家粮食都抢走，全家吃不到一粒米，你饿得头发都掉了！你现在能去报仇了，当妈的怎不愿意呢？”我听完妈这些话，觉得她真好。正在这时候，娥珍妹妹从外面匆匆跑来，头发被风吹得有些乱，脸上有几滴汗珠，手里拿着一条新毛巾和一个新洋磁碗。我很奇怪地问她：“是谁的？”她的眼睛像一对小灯向我溜了一下说：“咱妈叫我到合作社给你买的。”我高兴的自言自语说：“咱妈想的可真周到呀！”
    所要带的东西差不多准备齐了，就差妇女协会做的那双鞋还没拿来。夜深了，家里的人还在闹轰轰的，大爷叔叔们再三叮嘱我：“到了军队里好好听上级的话，给家里大爷叔叔们争光。”半夜过了，人们都各自回家睡了，我也在屋里躺下了；可是妈妈还在给我烙明天要带的干粮呢！
    我在炕上躺着翻来覆去睡不着，心里想：在报名前，啥也不害怕，就是怕妈妈哭，可没想到妈妈不但不哭，反而比平时还高兴。原来她比谁都明白，“打不倒蒋介石是没好日子过的”。妈妈烙完干粮，又悄悄地走到我炕边：“贵！”她低声的叫了我一声，顺手递给我一块干粮，她坐在我枕边亲切地说：“吃吧！孩子！吃了这干粮在外面狠狠打蒋介石。”她说到“狠狠打蒋介石”这几个字时特别有力，虽然屋子里很黑，我看不到她的脸，但我听得出她是咬着牙齿说的。我听了她的话，心里越发兴奋了，更睡不着了；就坐起来，拳头伸了一下，好像是向妈宣誓一样地说：“妈！我一定记住你的话！”
    第二天一清早，街上的锣鼓就叮噹叮噹敲起来了。人们成群结队地朝我家门上走来，村长在村里挑了一匹好马，从马头到马尾都装饰了红花，背上搭了一条新花褥子，拴在门前的大槐树上。小孩子小姑娘叫的特别响，常说笑话的刘二嫂走过来说：“参军的人儿真光荣，骑的马儿也是花不隆咚，等俺小魁长大了，也要参军，给妈也争点光荣。”这话引得人们都憋不住地笑起来。停了一会，学校教员领着两个小学生，拨开了人群挤到我家门口，把对联贴在门框上：右面写的“光荣参军打老蒋”，左面写的“保家卫国享安康”。又把大红绸子搭在门头上，三朵大花插在当中，石柱子上还挂上了“一人参军全家光荣”的牌子。吃过饭，全家人把我送出门，骑上了大马，秧歌队早就开始扭起来了。嘿！你看那个热闹吧！我在马上，人们简直把我围了个风雨不透。小学生招着小手叫着：“叔叔再见吧！”有的喊：“叔叔！哥哥！可给俺来信哪！”站在马屁股后边的隔壁的大爷，手里拿着大烟袋，带着满面笑容说：“别的不跟你要，只望你来信多捎点胜利消息来就是了。”我那个时候，简直高兴得不知说啥才好，妈妈站在门坎上拉着嗓子叫我：“贵！可记着来信！”“记着哩！”我回答着。马走动了，人们笑着，喊着口号，一直把我送到村外。
