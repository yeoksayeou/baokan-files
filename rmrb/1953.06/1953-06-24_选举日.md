    Election Day
    Bingzhang, Qiyi Zuoxin, Shufeng
    On a bright afternoon, June 10th, in the third election district of Qili Township, Kunyu County, Shandong Province – the people of Kuangbei Village, after eating lunch, some put on new clothes, each holding a voter certificate with a red stamp, considered a "certificate of honor," and left their homes, hurriedly gathering in one direction – towards a place with the five-star red flag and Chairman Mao's portrait hanging. Instantly, a large locust tree in the middle of the crossroads was filled with people.
    The old people talked enthusiastically about "household matters," and the laughter of the young people seemed particularly loud. There was a reason for people to be so happy – the election day they had been waiting for for thirty days had arrived. People knew they were masters of the country and should elect the people they were most satisfied with and most needed to represent their views and manage national affairs. For this purpose, to exercise their right to vote, they gathered here. Cong Shubao, an old man of fifty-four, was sick and hadn't eaten for a day, but forgot his stomach ache when he thought about the election meeting. Zhang Xiuzhi, in order to attend the election meeting, comforted her sick mother and ran back to her mother-in-law's house. Because people respected their solemn rights, they all attended the meeting on time according to the notice given a few days earlier. Therefore, the meeting minutes clearly recorded: "Out of 39 households in the village, with a total of 147 people, 80 had the right to vote, and 75 actually attended. ..."
    Comrade Zheng Renliang, a representative sent by the township election committee, appeared behind a square table, and dozens of eyes immediately turned towards him, and the laughter stopped immediately. At this time, only the little chickens running around the venue were heard chirping a few times, and then Zheng Renliang announced loudly, "The meeting begins!" The solemn election meeting began from this moment. The elected presidium sat on the stools, and the recorder was also lying on the table, and the pen began to move. After the chairman explained the election method, the meeting officially entered the election. The chairman announced the candidates for representatives: "Those who agree that Cong Maosheng should be the representative, please raise your hand!" Immediately, many calloused right hands rose like a forest in the crowd; the vote counter shouted from the side: "One, two... fifteen... sixty... put your hands down!" With the shout, the abacus beads on the table of the presidium were running up and down on several vertical columns, making a "ping la" and "pang la" sound. When the abacus beads stopped with the last sound, the chairman announced: "Cong Maosheng has 68 votes and is elected!" A burst of pleasant chatter immediately erupted from the crowd. The chairman announced the name of the second candidate for representative, Li Changfeng, and as a result, she was elected as a representative with 70 votes.
    About half an hour passed, and the meeting proceeded to the free speech agenda. Cong Shusong, a young farmer, stood up, almost shouting: "Our meeting is a victory! I am so happy! I am even more satisfied with the elected representatives. In the future, we will raise more issues with them." Farmer Cong Shuxin talked about the vicious rule of the puppet township and Bao chiefs in the past, and the people lived a life without democracy in his speech; now, with the leadership of Chairman Mao, they have obtained such electoral rights. In order to celebrate the victory of the election with practical actions, he announced the production plan on behalf of their mutual aid group at the meeting. He said: "... Our mutual aid group plans to hoe the cornfield three times before the wheat harvest, and also hoe the sweet potato and peanut fields once, and ensure that wheat is universally selected...." Li Changfeng, an elderly woman who was elected as a representative, stood up. She walked to the middle of the venue, excitedly asking to speak, but didn't know how to say it, and didn't even know where to put her hands and feet. "Oh...I..." She finally spoke with a smile: "It's hard for me to speak...but I'm really happy. In the old society, women were not even allowed to speak on the street, let alone have the right to vote. In the past, I couldn't speak at meetings. Thanks to our Chairman Mao, we have the right to free elections today. In the future, if anyone has any opinions, tell me, and I will definitely bring them up for everyone. If I am not good enough, everyone should also give me more suggestions."
    As the sun set in the west, the shadow of the locust tree gradually receded from the wall with the red flag and Chairman Mao's portrait hanging on it, and the sunlight shone directly on the red flag and the kind face of Chairman Mao's portrait. The election meeting ended victoriously. People lightly withdrew from the venue and plunged into various production positions.

    选举日
    秉章、其义作新、枢峰
    六月十日的一个明朗的下午，山东省昆嵛县七里乡第三选区——夼北村的人们，吃过了午饭，有的穿上新衣，每人手中都拿着一张被认为是“光荣证”的盖有红印的选民证，走出家门，匆匆地朝着一个方向——挂着五星红旗和毛主席像的地方聚齐。立时，十字街当中的一棵大槐树底下聚满了人。
    老人们热烈地谈论着“家常话”，青年人的笑声显得格外响亮。人们这样高兴是有理由的——盼望了三十天的选举日到来了。人们知道自己是国家的主人，应当选举出自己最满意和最必要的人，代表自己的见解，去管理国家大事。为了这个目的，为了行使自己的选举权利，他们集拢到这里。五十四岁的丛树保老大爷生了病，已经一天没有吃饭，但想起开选举大会，暂时忘记了肚痛。张秀芝为了参加选举大会，安慰了自己得病的妈妈，跑回婆家来。由于人们对自己的庄严权利的尊重，都按照前几天的通知，准时到会了。因此，在会议记录簿上就清楚地记下：“全村三十九户，共有一百四十七人，有选民权利者八十人，实到会者七十五人。……”
    乡选举委员会派来的代表郑仁良同志出现在一张方桌的后面，马上数十双眼睛一齐朝向着他，说笑声立刻停顿下来。这时，只听见在会场周围跑动的小鸡“啾”、“啾”的叫了几声，接着郑仁良便高声宣布道：“开会啦！”庄严的选举大会，从这
    一时刻开始了。选出的主席团坐上了凳子，记录的人也伏在桌子上，钢笔蠕动起来。主席说明了选举方法后，会议正式进入选举。主席公布代表候选人了：“同意丛茂生为代表的，请举手！”人群里立刻丛林般竖起了许多长满茧子的右手；计票员在一旁喊着：“一、二……十五……六十……放下手！”随着喊声，主席团桌子上的算盘珠也在若干竖柱上上下跑动，发出“乒啦”、“乓啦”的响声。当算盘珠随着最后一颗响声站下的时候，主席宣布：“丛茂生六十八票，当选！”人群里立时发出一阵愉快的嘁喳声。主席又公布了第二个代表候选人李长凤的名字，结果她以七十票被选为代表。
    约半个钟头过去了，大会进行到自由演讲的议程。年青的农民丛树松站了起来，他几乎是大声地喊着：“我们的大会胜利了！我真高兴！选出的代表我更满意，今后咱们有什么事多向他们提。”农民丛树信在发言中谈到过去伪乡、保长的恶毒统治，人民过着毫无民主的生活；现在有了毛主席的领导，才获得这样的选举权利。为了以实际行动庆祝选举的胜利，他在会上代表他们的互助组宣布了生产计划。他说：“……我们互助组计划在麦收前把苞米地锄上三遍，地瓜、花生也锄一遍，小麦保证作到普遍选种……。”当选的代表李长凤老大娘站了起来。她走到会场当中，激动地要求说话，但又不知怎样说，连手脚都不知放到那里好。“哦……我……”她终于笑着说话了：“我说话很难……可心里真喜欢。旧社会妇女在街上说话都不行，那有妇女的选举权。过去我不能在会上说话，多亏了咱们毛主席，今天咱们才有自由选举的权利。今后大家有什么意见告诉我，我一定给大家带上去。我不够的地方大家也要多提。”
    在太阳偏西的时候，槐树的阴影渐渐退出挂有红旗和毛主席像的墙壁，太阳光直射在红旗上和毛主席像的慈祥的脸上。选举大会胜利结束了。人们轻快地退出了会场，投入各种生产阵地中去。
