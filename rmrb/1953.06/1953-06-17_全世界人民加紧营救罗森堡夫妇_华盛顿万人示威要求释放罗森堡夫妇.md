Xinhua News Agency, June 16th: The worldwide movement to save the Rosenbergs continues to surge, with ten thousand people demonstrating in front of the White House.

Washington dispatch: More than ten thousand people from various states of the United States and Canada, under the auspices of the National Committee for Fair Trial of the Rosenberg Case, held a demonstration in front of the White House on the 14th, holding up placards and demanding that Eisenhower release the Rosenbergs. Some placards read: "The electric chair cannot eliminate people's doubts about the Rosenberg case." Rosenberg's 65-year-old mother and the Rosenbergs' two sons also participated in the demonstration. The two children, aged six and ten, innocently asked: "Don't let anything happen to my mom and dad." The demonstrators later held a prayer meeting for the Rosenbergs at the intersection of Constitution Avenue and Ninth Street. Rosenberg's old mother spoke at the meeting, saying that Rosenberg had recently told her: "Mom, you know we are innocent." The old woman fainted and sobbed uncontrollably when she said that the Rosenbergs were innocent. The demonstrators decided to hold a round-the-clock vigil in front of the White House.

At the same time, the movement to save the Rosenbergs is developing into a massive wave of protests around the world. In South America, the Bolivian General Labor Confederation and a group of Chilean senators have sent telegrams to Eisenhower, demanding that the death sentences of the Rosenbergs be revoked.

Across the Atlantic, the British National Committee to Defend the Rosenbergs launched a demonstration movement to save the Rosenbergs. On the 14th, thousands of Londoners held a rally in Hyde Park, then demonstrated outside the US Embassy, protesting the death sentences imposed on the Rosenbergs. The demonstrations will continue until June 17th. Throughout Britain, protests and appeals are constantly increasing. The Executive Committee of the Transport and General Workers' Union of Britain, which has more than 1.2 million members, also demanded on the 12th that Eisenhower revoke the death sentences against the Rosenbergs.

The Archbishop of Paris, Féretin, telegraphed Eisenhower, demanding that the death sentences of the Rosenbergs be revoked. The French League for Human Rights has requested President Auriol and Queen Elizabeth to intercede with Eisenhower on behalf of the Rosenbergs' case. Public anger at the US government has reached such a degree that heavy guards have been added outside the US Embassy in Paris to prevent accidents; at the same time, news reports say that the US Embassy in France has reminded the US government in its report to the State Department to pay attention to the political impact that the execution of the Rosenbergs will have.

In Italy, the Jewish Federation telegraphed Eisenhower, protesting the death sentences of the Rosenbergs.

In Germany, the wave of protests is also continuing to rise. Scientists and artists of the German Democratic Republic held a protest rally, at which the American writer Stephen Heim, who recently took refuge in the Republic, exposed the truth of the Rosenberg case and the baselessness of the verdict. Various scientific institutions, people's organizations, model workers, social leaders, etc. of the German Democratic Republic have expressed their protests.

The Central Council of the Indonesian Sugar Industry Union and the Central Council of the Textile Workers' Union have telegraphed Eisenhower, demanding the release of the Rosenbergs.

However, the US judicial authorities still disregard the solemn protests of the people around the world and are determined to execute the Rosenbergs. The Supreme Court rejected the Rosenbergs' request for a retrial for the fourth time on the 15th.

    全世界人民加紧营救罗森堡夫妇
    华盛顿万人示威要求释放罗森堡夫妇
    【新华社十六日讯】全世界人民拯救罗森堡夫妇的运动继续高涨，白宫前举行万人示威。
    华盛顿消息：来自美国各州和加拿大的万余人，在争取罗森堡案公正裁决全国委员会主持下，高举着标语牌，于十四日在白宫前举行示威，要求艾森豪威尔释放罗森堡夫妇。有的标语上写着：“电椅消除不了人们对罗森堡夫妇案件的怀疑。”罗森堡的六十五岁的老母亲和罗森堡夫妇的两个儿子也参加了示威。一个六岁、一个十岁两个孩子天真无邪地要求：“不要让我的妈妈和爸爸遭受任何意外。”示威队伍后来到宪法大街与第九大街交叉的街口为罗森堡夫妇举行祈祷会。罗森堡的老母亲在会上讲话，她说，罗森堡最近还向她说：“妈妈，你知道我们是清白的。”老人在说罗森堡夫妇是清白的孩子时晕倒了，泣不成声。示威的人们决定在白宫前举行昼夜不停的请愿。
    同时，拯救罗森堡的运动正在全世界发展成为一个规模巨大的抗议浪潮。在南美，玻利维亚总工会和智利的一批参议员分别致电艾森豪威尔，要求取消罗森堡夫妇的死刑。
    横过大西洋，英国保卫罗森堡全国委员会发起了一个拯救罗森堡的示威运动。十四日，数千伦敦人民在海德公园举行集会，然后到美国大使馆外举行示威，抗议判处罗森堡夫妇死刑。示威将继续到六月十七日。在英国全国，抗议和呼吁正不断增多。拥有一百二十多万会员的英国运输与普通工人工会执行委员会，十二日也要求艾森豪威尔取消对罗森堡夫妇的死刑判决。
    巴黎大主教费莱丹致电艾森豪威尔，要求取消对罗森堡夫妇的死刑判决。法国人权联盟要求阿里奥尔总统和伊丽莎白女王为罗森堡夫妇的案件向艾森豪威尔进行交涉。人民对美国政府的愤怒已达到这样的程度，巴黎美国大使馆外已加设重岗，以防不测；同时有消息说，美国驻法大使馆曾在它给国务院的报告中提醒美国政府注意处死罗森堡将产生的政治上的影响。
    在意大利，犹太人联合会打电报给艾森豪威尔，抗议判罗森堡夫妇死刑。
    在德国，抗议的浪潮也在继续高涨。德意志民主共和国的科学家与艺术家举行抗议集会，不久前到共和国避难的美国作家斯蒂芬·海姆在会上揭发了罗森堡夫妇案件的真象和判决的毫无根据。德意志民主共和国的各科学机关、人民团体、模范工人、社会领袖等等都纷纷表示抗议。
    印尼糖业工会中央理会事和纺织工人工会中央理事会分别打电报给艾森豪威尔，要求释放罗森堡夫妇。
    但是迄今美国司法当局仍不顾全世界人民的严正抗议，执意杀害罗森堡夫妇，最高法院于十五日第四次拒绝了罗森堡夫妇提出的重审要求。
