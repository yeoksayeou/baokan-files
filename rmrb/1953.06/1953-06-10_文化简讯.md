    East China Prepares to Establish Writers Association
    The Preparatory Committee of the East China Federation of Literary and Art Circles held an enlarged meeting of its Standing Committee in Shanghai from May 28th to 30th. Participants included members of the East China Federation of Literary and Art Circles Preparatory Committee, members of the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles in the East China region, as well as leading cadres and creative personnel from literary and art circles in various provinces and cities in East China.

    Xia Yan, Deputy Director of the Propaganda Department of the East China Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Director of the East China Federation of Literary and Art Circles Preparatory Committee, conveyed the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles’ plan "Concerning Reorganizing the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles to Strengthen Leadership in Creative Work." Xia Yan also pointed out that current literary creation in East China lags far behind reality, and there is a lack of morale among writers. The main reason for this is the lack of specific and attentive leadership in creative work, as well as shortcomings in the organizational structure. To adapt to today's national situation and practical needs, it is necessary to reorganize East China's literary and art organizations, first preparing to establish the East China Writers Association, and then gradually reorganizing to establish associations for musicians, artists, performing artists, etc., and to rectify and strengthen the institutions and work of the Federations of Literary and Art Circles in various provinces and cities.

    The meeting elected Ba Jin and twelve others to form the preparatory committee for the East China Writers Association.

    Central Experimental Opera Theater Performs "Xiao Erhei's Marriage" for Workers in Factories and Mines
    The "Xiao Erhei's Marriage" performance team of the Central Experimental Opera Theater (formerly the Central Song and Dance Troupe) gave consolation performances in factories and mines in the suburbs of Beijing from April 9th to the end of May. A total of thirty-three performances were given, with an audience of 91,700 people. These performances were welcomed by the workers and played a certain role in implementing the Marriage Law and encouraging workers' production enthusiasm. All the performers and staff of the performance team were also greatly encouraged and educated during the performances. In addition to visiting various factories, they also listened to reports from Li Shunhe, a veteran worker who participated in the "February 7th" strike at the Changxindian Locomotive Repair Factory, and Liu Wenqin, a labor model from the Qinghe Woolen Mill.

    Currently, the Central Experimental Opera Theater is publicly performing the opera at the Xiaojingchang Experimental Theater.

    "Songs" Issue 6 was published on June 5th. The main content of this issue is the introduction of a selection of songs from the First National Folk Music and Dance Performance. These songs simply and beautifully reflect the lives and healthy emotions of the working people.

Songs such as "Yo Stone Tune," "Driving Horses Tune," and "Guessing Tune" not only praise labor but also embody the great spirit and boundless pride of the working people.

    This issue also introduces songs from Mongolia and Poland, which were recently performed in our country by artistic troupes from these two countries. These songs have been warmly welcomed by the people of our country during performances in the capital and other regions.
