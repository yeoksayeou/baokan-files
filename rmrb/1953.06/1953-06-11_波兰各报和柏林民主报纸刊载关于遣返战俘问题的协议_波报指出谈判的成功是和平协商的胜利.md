Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, June 9th: Polish newspapers all published the Xinhua News Agency report on the signing of the agreement on the repatriation of prisoners of war at Panmunjom on the front page on the 9th. The newspapers said that the Korean armistice, which the whole world is extremely eager for, is just around the corner.

Commenting on the agreement reached at Panmunjom on the repatriation of prisoners of war, "Głos Pracy" wrote: "Now world public opinion is eagerly awaiting the moment when a full-scale armistice and a cessation of all hostilities will arrive. This moment should come immediately after the signing of the armistice agreement.

Peace negotiations, which began nearly two years ago on the proposal of the Soviet government, will in the near future produce the fruits that all mankind is eagerly hoping for—peace. The success of the negotiations will be a great victory for a truth announced by the Soviet government. That truth is: nothing cannot be resolved by peaceful consultation.

The governments of the People's Republic of China and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea proposed two months ago to resume the armistice negotiations, which were interrupted not through their fault, and at the same time put forward specific proposals to resolve the contentious prisoner of war issue. This initiative of the Chinese and Korean governments received strong support from the Soviet Union and widespread support from world public opinion. Even countries that previously supported the aggressors had to admit the fairness and concreteness of the plan put forward by the people's side." "Głos Pracy" concluded: "The people of all countries, including the Polish people, are deeply convinced that the victory of peace in Korea expands and consolidates the prospects for peace throughout the world, and the victory of peace in Korea can and should become an example to inspire people to make every possible effort to resolve all issues related to the maintenance of world peace through negotiations."

Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, June 10th: All democratic newspapers in Berlin published the news of the signing of the agreement on the repatriation of prisoners of war at Panmunjom on the front page on the 9th with banner headlines, and also published the communique issued by the Korean-Chinese delegation broadcast by the Central People's Broadcasting Station of Beijing. "Neues Deutschland" published the news of the agreement and the agreement communique under the title "Agreement Reached on All Issues in the Korean Armistice Negotiations." "Tägliche Rundschau", "Junge Welt", "Berliner Zeitung" and other newspapers also published this news in prominent positions.

    波兰各报和柏林民主报纸刊载关于遣返战俘问题的协议
    波报指出谈判的成功是和平协商的胜利
    【新华社十日讯】波兰通讯社华沙九日讯：波兰各报九日都在第一版刊登新华社报道的板门店签订关于遣返战俘问题的协议的消息。各报说，全世界所极其渴望的朝鲜停战就在眼前了。
    在评论板门店达成的关于遣返战俘的协议时，“劳动之声报”写道：“现在世界公众舆论迫切地等待着全线停战和一切敌对行动停止的时刻到来。这个时刻应当在停战协定签字之后立即到来。
    将近两年前在苏联政府建议下开始的和平谈判，在不久的将来就会产生全人类所迫切希望的果实——和平。谈判的成功将是苏联政府所宣布的一个真理的伟大胜利。这个真理就是：没有一件事情不可以用和平协商的方法来解决。
    中华人民共和国和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府在两月前建议恢复并不是由于他们的过错而中断的停战谈判，同时提出了解决引起争端的战俘问题的具体建议。中朝政府的这个倡议受到了苏联的热烈支持，并得到了世界舆论的广泛支持。甚至以前一向支持侵略者的国家也不得不承认人民方面所提出的这个方案的公平与具体的性质”。 “劳动之声报”最后说：“世界各国人民，包括波兰人民在内，深信朝鲜和平的胜利扩大并巩固了全世界和平的前景，朝鲜和平的胜利可以并且应该成为一个范例，激励人们作一切可能的努力来通过谈判的方式，解决与维护和世界和平有关的一切问题。”
    【新华社柏林十日电】柏林所有的民主报纸九日都在第一版以通栏标题刊载了在板门店签订关于战俘遣返问题的协议的消息，并刊载了北京中央人民广播电台广播的朝中代表团所发表的公报。“新德意志报”以“在朝鲜停战谈判的所有问题上达成协议”为题，刊载了关于达成协议的消息和协议公报。“每日评论”、“青年世界”、“柏林日报”和其他报纸也都以显著地位刊载了这个消息。
