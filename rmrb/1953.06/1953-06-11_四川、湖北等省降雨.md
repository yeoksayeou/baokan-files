    Rainfall in Sichuan, Hubei, and Other Provinces
    From late May to early June, rainfall occurred successively in some areas of Sichuan Province, most areas of Hubei Province, areas along the Yangtze River in Jiangsu Province, and forty-seven counties in Henan Province. Sichuan Province had one rainfall in late May, and from June 1st to 7th, rainfall continued in various places. This time, the rainfall in Fuling, Fengjie, and other places in eastern Sichuan was more than 20 millimeters; Suining in northern Sichuan was 24 millimeters; Leibo and Luxian in southern Sichuan were 20 to 40 millimeters; and Xinjin and other places in western Sichuan were 40 millimeters. Hubei Province had not had a thorough rain since the beginning of spring. In late May, most parts of the province received rainfall, and the drought has been alleviated. In Jiangsu Province, rainfall in Taizhou, Taixing, and other places north of the Yangtze River was 2 to 14 millimeters; rainfall in Jiangyin, Suzhou, and other places south of the Yangtze River was 6 to 33 millimeters. The Xinxiang area of ​​Henan Province originally had drought conditions, but this time the rainfall was heavy. The rainfall in Yuanyang, Xiuwu, and other twelve counties generally reached over 24 to 37 millimeters; thorough rain also fell in the mountainous areas of Luanchuan, Songxian, and other areas south of the Yellow River.
    This rainfall in various places has a significant effect on the growth of major autumn crops and the sowing of late autumn crops. Farmers in the rainfall areas of Hubei Province are actively rushing to transplant seedlings after the rain and are weeding and applying topdressing fertilizer in cotton and sorghum fields. Farmers in the rainfall areas of Jiangsu are also seizing the time to weed after the rain. After the rainfall in Henan, the Department of Agriculture and Forestry of the Henan Provincial People's Government instructed various regions that in areas with heavy rainfall, they should lead farmers to seize the opportunity to sow late autumn crops while the soil is moist. Areas that have harvested wheat should sow first and then thresh; in areas with little or no rain, farmers should be educated to eliminate the passive mentality of waiting for rain and actively carry out drought-resistant planting.

    四川、湖北等省降雨
    五月下旬到六月初，四川省部分地区、湖北省大部地区、江苏省沿长江两岸地区以及河南省的四十七个县先后落雨。四川省五月下旬降了一次雨，六月一日至七日，各地又继续降雨，这次川东涪陵、奉节等地的降雨量在二十公厘以上；川北遂宁为二十四公厘；川南雷波、泸县为二十至四十公厘；川西新津等地为四十公厘。湖北省入春以后，没有落过一次透雨，五月下旬，全省大部地区落雨，旱象已经减轻。江苏省长江以北泰州、泰兴等地降雨量两公厘至十四公厘；长江以南江阴、苏州等地降雨六公厘至三十三公厘。河南省新乡专区原来有旱象，这次雨量很大，原阳、修武等十二个县降雨量一般都在二十四到三十七公厘以上；黄河以南的栾川、嵩县等山区也都下了透雨。
    各地这次降雨，对大秋作物生长和晚秋作物播种有很大作用。湖北省降雨地区的农民，雨后积极抢插秧苗和在棉花、高粱等田里进行薅草、施追肥。江苏降雨地区的农民，在雨后也抓紧进行锄草。河南降雨后，河南省人民政府农林厅指示各个专区，在落雨量较大的地区，要领导农民趁墒抢种晚秋作物。已收割了麦子的地区要先种后打；雨小或没落雨的地区，要教育农民消除消极的等雨思想，积极地进行抗旱点种。       （新华社）
