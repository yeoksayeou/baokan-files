Jiangsu and Xinjiang Provinces
Achieve Success in Locust Control Work

Jiangsu Province and Xinjiang Province have already achieved success in locust control work.

The main force of early-hatched locust nymphs in Jiangsu Province has been basically eliminated; now, various localities are carrying out the extermination of the second batch of locust nymphs.

Locust control work in various parts of Jiangsu Province was fully launched in late May. In Xuzhou, Huaiyin, Gaoyou, and the reed marshes along the coast and lakes, more than 5,000 trained farmers are carrying out locust extermination by spraying powder or spreading poison bait. The mortality rate of locusts killed by spraying powder and poison bait is over 85 to 90 percent. The Central People's Government sent airplanes to support farmers in the Weishan Lake area in spraying powder to kill locusts, and the powder spraying was completed by June 5. A total of more than 390 sorties were flown, with a powder spraying area of more than 107,000 mu. After the completion of aerial spraying, more than 18,000 local farmers immediately went deep into the lake and marshes to conduct a thorough investigation and elimination, wiping out the remaining locust nymphs.

In Xinjiang Province, locusts in farmland and surrounding weedy areas of various locust-affected areas have been basically eliminated. As of June 6, the province's locust control area has reached 675,000 mu, accounting for nearly 70 percent of this year's locust control area. Among them, the aerial locust control area is 375,000 mu, and the manual and mechanical locust control area reaches 300,000 mu. 150,000 mu of farmland invaded by locusts has been rescued.

Now, the focus of locust control in Xinjiang Province has shifted from agricultural areas to mountainous and reed lake areas. Eight locust control aircraft are advancing towards the mountainous and reed lake areas surrounding the agricultural areas at an average speed of about 24,000 mu of medicinal powder and poison bait spread per day, continuing to eliminate hidden locusts.

    江苏、新疆两省
    灭蝗工作有成绩
    江苏省和新疆省的灭蝗工作已经有了成绩。
    江苏省早期孵化的蝗蝻主力已基本扑灭；现在各地正进行消灭第二批蝗蝻。
    江苏省各地灭蝗工作在五月下旬即全面展开。徐州、淮阴、高邮和沿海沿湖的芦苇滩地，有五千多名经过训练的农民进行喷粉或撒布毒饵灭蝗。喷粉和毒饵诱杀蝗虫死亡率达百分之八十五到九十以上。中央人民政府派飞机支援微山湖地区农民喷粉灭蝗，到六月五日已喷粉结束。计共飞行三百九十多架次，喷粉面积达十万七千多亩。在飞机喷粉结束后，当地农民一万八千多人又立即深入湖荡进行清查捕打、肃清了残余蝗蝻。
    新疆省各蝗灾区农田和农田周围荒草地上的蝗虫已基本肃清。截至六月六日止，全省灭蝗面积已达六十七万五千亩，占今年治蝗面积近百分之七十。其中飞机灭蝗面积为三十七万五千亩，人工、药械灭蝗面积达三十万亩。被蝗虫侵入的十五万亩农田已得到抢救。
    现在，新疆省灭蝗的重点，已由农业区转入山区和苇湖地区。八架灭蝗飞机正以每天平均撒布药粉、毒饵达面积两万四千亩左右的速度，向农业区周围的山区和苇湖地区推进，继续消灭隐蔽的蝗虫。
