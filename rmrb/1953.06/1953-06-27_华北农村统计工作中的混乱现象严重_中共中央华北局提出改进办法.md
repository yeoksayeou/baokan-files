    Severe Chaos in Rural Statistics Work in North China
    North China Bureau of the CCP Proposes Improvement Measures
    To change the chaotic situation in rural statistical work in North China, the Rural Work Department of the North China Bureau of the CCP convened a meeting of relevant departments at the North China level to specifically examine the rural statistical report forms of various systems. It focused on examining the rural report forms of Yuci Special District in Shanxi and Ding County in Hebei, analyzing and studying them, and found that the phenomenon of all levels of leading organs indiscriminately transferring and issuing statistical report forms to rural areas was extremely serious. This chaotic phenomenon is mainly manifested in the following aspects:
    First, there are too many report forms, and the workload is too heavy. The four sets of forms issued by the Shanxi Provincial Finance and Economics Committee, such as "Total Agricultural Production Value and Labor Employment Statistics," have 74 sheets, totaling 6,307 items. The agricultural census form has a set of 28 types, 303 items, 465 columns, and 114 filling instructions, totaling more than 10,000 words, enough to make a book. Each farmer has to answer "83 questions." Other departments, such as health, taxation, banks, insurance companies, and cooperatives, and various specialized companies, also have serious problems in indiscriminately issuing various report forms to rural areas because there is no unified agency to control them. Yuci County Cooperatives issued more than 180 kinds of forms in three months; Yuwan Village in the first district of Lan County received 24 kinds of forms in twenty days in February.
    Second, the content of the report forms is complicated, with no focus. Among the various statistical report forms, agricultural production accounts for the largest share. For example, agricultural statistical forms in Yuci, Shanxi, account for 40% of all forms, with complex and numerous contents, ranging from population and households to cultivated land area, harvest yield, improved variety promotion, agricultural implement improvement, soil improvement, dry land converted to paddy fields, manure accumulation, fertilization, mutual aid organizations, bumper harvest progress, and agricultural and sideline products, reaching more than ten items. In the statistics of mules, horses, cattle, sheep, pigs, ducks, chickens, and geese, in addition to distinguishing between male, female, large, and small, it is also necessary to distinguish between fat and thin, and even the number of beehives must be divided into male and female. The strangest thing is to use numbers to conduct ideological statistics. For example, the Shanxi Office for Implementing the Marriage Law asked counties to count the number of cadres and masses who approve, support, doubt, oppose, and are indifferent. In addition, there are some absurd and bizarre statistical requirements, such as investigating sexual chaos in rural areas, which has created a bad influence among the masses.
    Third, there are too many requirements, divorced from reality, and deadlines are too tight, making it impossible to fill them out. Rural forms are not only by year and by season, but also by month, by week, and by ten-day period, completely transplanting the urban and factory system to the small-scale agricultural economy of the countryside. Xiyang County asked farmers to make five-year plans, as well as monthly plans; in order to realize the monthly plan, farmers were asked to go to the fields as early as the second day of the first lunar month. The Water Conservancy Section of Yuci County, Shanxi, investigated the "social water source situation," asking each district and village to understand the area ratio of sweet, bitter, and salty water, the depth of the water source, and the irrigation situation of the whole village, and to draw charts in different colors, with a limited time to complete them.
    In this way, the more forms are issued indiscriminately from above, the more resentment and resistance it causes among the cadres below. Their method is "to do what can be done, suppress what cannot be done, push what can be pushed, resist what can be resisted, and estimate and report if resistance fails." Village cadres in Xiyang County said: "The mouth is a flowing river, the belly is an old account, whatever you want, we have it," "The special district urges, the county wants, the district collects, the village fabricates." This is the conclusion drawn by district and village cadres on the filling process. This situation seriously affects the truthful filling of necessary statistical tables.
    The meeting analyzed the causes and consequences of this situation: First of all, the requirements of local leading cadres for rural work did not proceed from the current state of small-scale agricultural economy as instructed by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, but instead subjectively put forward too many tasks and excessive and urgent demands, blindly demanding "planning in the form of tables" and attempting to find out the bottom line of the peasants all at once. Some cadres in Shanxi Province who were doing agricultural census work said in the people's schools after arriving in the villages: "We must investigate everything in boxes and cabinets," which caused many concerns among the masses.
    Secondly, there is decentralism, with multiple departments issuing orders and each doing its own thing. Various tasks have offices, and each office independently deploys investigation forms, outlines, and charts downward, and urges the figures by telephone, telegram, and special delivery. There are duplications in the items, regions, and times of the forms issued by various departments, resulting in a serious waste of manpower and material resources in all aspects. Some, because of being fond of boasting and seeking great achievements, statistically surveyed items that greatly exceeded the scope of their work, and even developed to the point of trying to be different.
    Third, bureaucracy and formalism are serious. There are many investigations and few studies. They only reach out downwards for numbers and do not pay attention to constantly accumulating materials. When various departments need to write reports and summaries to higher authorities, they ask for numbers from below and issue forms. Dozens or even hundreds of forms are concentrated in the villages. Hebei Province once issued a "Survey Form for Farmers' Spare Time Schools," which even had a so-called item "How many middle school students are there who are children or elderly?" Some leading cadres not only did not stop this phenomenon that harms the interests of the masses, but also temporarily grabbed at things indiscriminately themselves, which further fueled the development of this phenomenon. According to existing materials, the most forms are issued to districts and villages, and the greatest hindrance to work and production is also there. The time limit is the most urgent, and there are more false reports fabricated below. It is of course very dangerous for leading organs to use these materials as a basis for formulating plans, guiding work, and criticizing and commending.
    Fourth, some leading organs and form makers have serious formalism and bourgeois statistical views. They do not understand the actual situation in rural areas and blindly pursue so-called "scientific tabulation." Some forms are so numerous that they require large carts or trucks to carry them, the styles are constantly being updated, and there are many terminologies, leaving those below confused.
    Based on research and analysis, everyone unanimously believes that the phenomenon of excessive rural forms is a direct product of bureaucracy and decentralism, and is an important item of the "five excesses" in rural areas. It and the multiplicity of tasks are mutually causal. Therefore, the meeting believes that correcting this chaotic situation and establishing a correct reporting and statistical system must be regarded as an important part of the struggle against bureaucracy, and must be carried out simultaneously with the opposition to the "five excesses" in rural areas. We must expose a large number of "illegal" forms, and conduct inspections from top to bottom, and launch criticism from bottom to top. Through the handling of typical cases, cadres at all levels will realize the harm of excessive forms, and everyone will rise up to correct this error of bureaucracy, decentralism, formalism, and red tape, in order to establish a strict, feasible, and urgently needed, correct reporting and statistical system.
    In order to thoroughly correct this bias and establish a correct statistical reporting system, it is also necessary to strictly control it from the following aspects:
    (1) Simplify the planning forms for agricultural production and other various tasks, and remove unnecessary complex and cumbersome planning items, in order to completely eliminate the phenomenon of complex content in rural forms.
    (2) Party committees at all levels should strictly control the organization. In addition to uniformly arranging various tasks, they must also establish a strict review and approval system and uniformly manage reporting work. The basic figures (including production and construction, social conditions, grassroots organizations, etc.) that the state needs to grasp should be designated as statutory reports. Party committees and governments at all levels shall not arbitrarily change them. The statistics of temporary tasks should be controlled by party and government organs above the provincial level. The report forms of various business departments should be personally reviewed and signed by the leading cadres of the various business departments and submitted to the organs in charge of statistical work above the provincial level for approval.
    (3) Necessary investigation and statistical work can generally invite cadres and farmers who are familiar with the situation to hold meetings and forums, supplemented by necessary typical sampling checks and careful research to obtain more reliable materials; but it must never be done by means of queue reporting and door-to-door tracing.
    In short, when correcting the above-mentioned biases, on the one hand, we must oppose excessive and useless (some are harmful) forms, and on the other hand, we must pay close attention to the filling of necessary and appropriate forms, and realistically formulate and fill out some statistical forms. This is of great significance to the work. Any view and statement that ignores the importance of statistical work and considers that a statistical form is "five excesses" is also wrong. This will inevitably lead to the result of "not knowing the numbers in your heart," and therefore, it will also be impossible to plan your work well.

    华北农村统计工作中的混乱现象严重
    中共中央华北局提出改进办法
    为了改变华北农村统计工作中的混乱现象，中共中央华北局农村工作部召集了华北级各有关部门的会议，专门检查了各系统农村统计表报情况，并重点检查了山西榆次专区和河北定县的农村表报情况，进行分析研究，发现各级领导机关不加控制地向农村乱转和乱发统计表报的现象极为严重。这种混乱现象主要表现在以下几方面：
    首先是表报繁多，分量过重。山西省财政经济委员会所发“农业生产总值及劳动就业统计”等四套表格，即有七十四张，六千三百零七项。农业普查表一套二十八种，三百零三项，四百六十五栏，填表说明一百十四条，长万余言，可成一本书，每个农民都要解答“八十三问”。其他如卫生、税收、银行、保险公司、合作社、各专业公司等部门，因没有统一的机关进行掌握与控制，乱向农村发各种报表的现象也很严重。榆次县合作社三个月即发表格一百八十多种；岚县一区榆湾村二月份二十天内就收到表格二十四种。
    其次是表报内容复杂，毫无重点。各种统计表报中以农业生产分量最大，如山西榆次农业统计表格占所有表格的百分之四十，内容复杂繁多，从人口、户数到耕地面积，收获产量，良种推广，农具改良，改良土壤，旱田变水田，积肥、施肥，互助组织，丰产进度，农畜副产等达十余项之多。统计骡、马、牛、羊、猪、鸭、鸡、鹅，除分公、母、大、小之外，还要分肥瘦，养蜂多少也要有公母之分。最奇怪的是要用数字来作思想统计，如山西贯彻婚姻法办公室叫各县统计干部群众赞成、拥护、怀疑、反对及漠不关心的各有多少。此外，还有一些荒唐怪诞的统计要求，如调查农村性乱情况，在群众中造成恶劣的影响。
    三是要求过多，脱离实际，限时太急，无法填报。农村表格不仅按年按季，还要按月、按周、按旬，完全把城市、工厂的一套搬到小农经济的农村。昔阳县要农民订五年计划，还有月计划；为了实现月计划，正月初二就让农民上地。山西榆次县水利科，调查“社会水源情况”，让各区、村了解甜、苦、咸水的面积比例，水源深度，全村浇地情况等，并要绘成图表，以不同颜色标明，限时完成。
    这样，上面越是乱发表格，越是引起下面干部的埋怨与抗拒，他们的办法是“能办就办，不能办就压，能推就推，能抗就抗，推抗不住就估计上报。”昔阳县村干部说：“嘴是流水，肚是老账，要啥有啥”，“专区催，县里要，区里收，村里造”。这就是区村干部对填报过程所作的结论。这种情况，严重地影响到必要统计表的真实填报。
    会议分析了产生这种情况的原因及其恶果：首先是各地领导干部对农村工作的要求，没有按照中共中央指示的从小农经济的生产现状出发，而是主观主义地提出过多的任务和过高、过急的要求，盲目地要求“计划表格化”，企图一下子弄清农民的家底。山西省作农业普查工作的同志到村以后，有的干部在民校讲：“箱里柜里也要调查”，使群众产生很多顾虑。
    其次是分散主义，政出多门，各搞一套。各种工作都有办公室，各办公室又各自孤立地向下布置调查表格、提纲、图表，并以电话、电报、专人送信等方式催要数字。各部门所发表格的项目、地区、时间都有重复的现象。造成各方面人力物力的严重浪费。有的因为好大喜功，所统计的项目大大超过他应该掌握的工作范围，甚至发展到标新立异的程度。
    第三，官僚主义、文牍主义作风严重。调查多，研究少，只伸手向下要数字，不注意经常地积累材料。各部门如遇给上级写报告、总结时，就往下面要数字，发表格，集中到村就有数十种乃至数百种之多。河北省曾发出“农民业余学校调查表”，其中竟有所谓“儿童或老年的中学生有多少？”的项目。有些领导干部对这种危害群众利益的现象，不但不加制止，自己也临时乱抓，更加助长了这种现象的发展。据现有材料，表报发到区、村的最多，妨害工作和生产也最大。限定时间最急，下面捏造假报的也多，领导机关以这些材料作为制定计划，指导工作以及批评表扬的依据，当然是十分危险的。
    第四，有些领导机关和制表人员，存在着严重的形式主义和资产阶级统计学的观点。他们不了解农村的实际情况，盲目追求所谓“表格科学化”，有的表格多到用大车拉、汽车载，样式翻新，术语很多，弄得下面莫名其妙。
    根据研究分析，大家一致认为这种农村表格多的现象，是官僚主义、分散主义的直接产物，是农村“五多”的重要项目之一。它和任务多是互为因果的。因此，会议认为纠正这种混乱情况，树立正确的表报统计制度，必须当作为反对官僚主义斗争的重要内容，与反对农村“五多”同时进行。要大量揭发“非法”表格，并自上而下地进行检查，自下而上地展开批评。通过典型事例的处理，使各级干部认识到表报多的危害，使大家起来纠正这种官僚主义、分散主义、形式主义和文牍主义的错误，以便建立严格可行而又迫切需要的、正确的统计表报制度。
    为了彻底纠正这种偏向，建立正确的统计表报制度，还必须从以下几方面加以严格控制：
    （一）简化农业生产及其他各种工作的计划表格，去掉不必要的复杂繁琐的计划项目，以彻底清除农村表格内容复杂的现象。
    （二）各级党委应从组织上严加控制，除统一安排各项工作任务外，还必须建立严格的审查批准制度，统一管理表报工作。对于国家需要掌握的基本数字（包括生产建设、社会情况、基层组织等）应定为法定表报。各级党委和政府均不得随意更改。临时任务的统计，应由省以上党政机关控制。各个业务部门的表报，应由各个业务部门的领导干部亲自审查签署，报请省以上的主管统计工作的机关批准。
    （三）必要的调查统计工作一般地可邀请熟悉情况的干部和农民开会座谈，辅之以必要的典型抽查对证，加以认真研究，得出比较可靠的材料；但绝不能用排队报、挨户追的办法。
    总之，在纠正上述偏向时，一方面要反对过多的和无用的（有些是有害的）表格，另一方面必须十分重视必要的和应有的表格的填制，实事求是地制发并填报若干统计表格。这对于工作是有莫大意义的。任何忽视统计工作的重要性，以为一要统计表格就是“五多”的看法和说法也是错误的。这样，必然导致“心中无数”的结果，因而也将无法规划好自己的工作。
