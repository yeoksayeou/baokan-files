Xinhua News Agency, June 23rd: A U.S. military delegation led by U.S. Pacific Army Commander General O’Daniel arrived in Saigon from the Philippines on the 20th to conduct activities. In addition to nine U.S. Army, Navy, and Air Force officers, the delegation includes Bonsal, Director of the Southeast Asia Affairs Division of the U.S. State Department.

According to a statement issued by the U.S. Embassy in Saigon, the U.S. military delegation's visit will "discuss France's operational plans with the French side; and discuss a way to ensure that U.S. military and financial assistance to France and the member states of the Federation can be used most effectively to achieve the firm goal of defeating the Communists as soon as possible." According to the Associated Press, the delegation will also urge the acceleration of the training of the armies of the three puppet states of Indochina. To this end, the U.S. military delegation will meet with General Navarre, commander-in-chief of the French invading forces in Indochina, and will inspect the battlefield. These activities of the U.S. military delegation indicate that the United States is intensifying its aggressive deployment in Indochina.

Equally noteworthy is that representatives of the three Indochinese puppet groups, including Bao Dai, will participate in the U.S.-French talks. A statement issued by the U.S. State Department specifically emphasized this point, saying: "Arrangements have been made so that the military leaders of the member states of the Federation can participate in these discussions." The statement touted the "important role" of these three puppet armies and said that the participation of these military leaders in the talks "will make the discussions even more important." Immediately after arriving in Saigon, O'Daniel consulted with Nguyen Van Tam, the prime minister of the Bao Dai puppet government. All indications are that the U.S. ruling clique, which has always used "aid" as bait and used the so-called "effective use of aid" as a cover, is trying to use the activities of this military mission to squeeze out France's position in Indochina and seize control of the three puppet governments and armies.

Xinhua News Agency, June 24th: Simultaneously with the United States sending a military delegation to Indochina, some U.S. congressmen are clamoring for the use of "aid" to force France to make concessions so that the United States can further intervene in Indochina.

According to Agence France-Presse, Washington, June 21: At a meeting of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee to study the foreign aid bill, Republican Senator Knowland said that he was "not very satisfied with the reports received from Indochina." He expressed concern about the distribution of U.S. military supplies "aid" to France to Indochina, and he was worried that the situation in Indochina would "become similar to what happened in Greece and China." Knowland also believed that France's refusal to allow American inspection was unjustified. He said, "Unless we have the power of inspection, I will not approve giving them a blank check."

On the 20th, U.S. Republican Senator Alexander Smith read out a portion of a report submitted by a group of American businessmen sent to Indochina by the "Mutual Security Agency" in March of this year, and questioned the "Mutual Security Agency." The report stated: "What is urgently needed now is better cooperation between France and us, and it is very necessary to do so if we are to achieve our goals and make the aid we have already given more effective." As everyone knows, France is preventing the intrusion of American forces into Indochina under the guise of cooperation.

    美国军事代表团到越南活动
    表明美国正加紧进行侵略部署
    【新华社二十三日讯】由美国太平洋陆军司令奥丹尼尔率领的一个美国军事代表团，已在二十日从菲律宾到达西贡进行活动。代表团团员中除九个美国陆、海、空军的军官外，还有美国国务院东南亚事务司司长邦沙尔。
    据在西贡的美国大使馆发表声明说：美国军事代表团此行，将与法国方面“讨论法国的作战计划；并讨论一种方法，使美国给法国和各联邦成员国部队的军事和财政援助，能够最有效地用于尽快实现击败共军的坚定目标”。另据合众社说，代表团并将敦促加快训练印度支那三傀儡国的军队。为此，美国军事代表团将与法国侵略印度支那部队总司令纳瓦尔会谈，并将前往战场视察。美国军事代表团的这些活动，表明美国正加紧在印度支那进行侵略部署。
    同样可以注意的一点是，在这次举行的美法会谈中，将有保大等三个印度支那傀儡集团的代表参加。美国国务院发表的声明特别强调这一点说：“已经安排好使联邦成员国的军事领袖可以参加这些讨论。”该声明吹嘘这三支傀儡军队的“重要作用”，并说，这些军事领袖参加会谈“将使讨论更加重要”。奥丹尼尔在到达西贡后，立即就和保大傀儡政府的首相阮文心进行会商。种种迹象说明：一向以“援助”为钓饵并以所谓“有效地使用援助”作为幌子的美国统治集团，正竭力要通过这次军事使团的活动来排挤法国在印度支那的地位，夺取对三个傀儡政府和军队的控制权。
    【新华社二十四日讯】和美国派遣军事代表团到印度支那活动的同时，美国的一些议员又叫嚷利用“援助”迫使法国让步，以便美国能进一步插足印度支那。
    据法新社华盛顿二十一日消息透露：在美国参议院外交委员会研究援外法案的会议上，共和党参议员诺兰说：他“对从印度支那收到的报告不太满意”。他表示对美国“援助”法国的军事物资分配给印度支那的情况感到不安，他担心印度支那的情况会“变成与曾经在希腊和中国发生的情况相似”。诺兰并认为法国拒绝美国的检查是毫无理由的。他说：“除非我们有这个检查的权力，否则我不赞成给他们一张空白支票。”
    二十日，美国共和党参议员亚历山大·史密斯曾在会议上特别宣读了“共同安全署”在今年三月派到印度支那去调查的一批美国商人提出的报告的一部分，并对“共同安全署”提出质询。报告中说：“目前所迫切需要的就是法国和我们之间要更好地合作，如果要达到我们的目的和使我们已经给予的援助更有效，这样做是非常必要的。”大家知道，法国正在防范美国势力在合作的名义下侵入印度支那。
