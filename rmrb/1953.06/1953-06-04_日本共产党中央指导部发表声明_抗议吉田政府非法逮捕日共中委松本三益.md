    Japanese Communist Party Central Guidance Department Issues Statement
    Protesting Yoshida Government's Illegal Arrest of JCP Central Committee Member Matsumoto Mitsugi
    [Dispatch from Our Newspaper] According to the Japanese "Akahata" newspaper: On May 14th, the Central Guidance Department of the Japanese Communist Party issued a statement regarding the Yoshida government's illegal arrest of Comrade Matsumoto Mitsugi, a member of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party, on May 13th. The full text is as follows:
    "The arrest of Comrade Matsumoto Mitsugi, an outstanding leader of our party, is not only a persecution against Matsumoto personally, nor is it only a persecution against the Japanese Communist Party; it is a prelude to the increasingly declining U.S.-Japan reactionaries' frantic fascist persecution of democratic and patriotic forces in Japan. If we remain indifferent to the illegal arrest of Comrade Matsumoto Mitsugi, it will be tantamount to allowing the U.S.-Japan reactionaries to carry out fascist persecution against democratic parties and democratic organizations in the future, and to allow successive illegal arrests and oppression of democratic and patriotic people. The 'Group Control Ordinance' has already expired, and the arrest of Comrade Matsumoto is groundless. Our party now lodges a serious protest against the police authorities' illegal arrest of Comrade Matsumoto Mitsugi and demands his immediate release. At the same time, it calls on the people of the whole country, especially workers, farmers, democratic parties, and democratic organizations, to rise up and widely launch a struggle against the fascist policies of the Yoshida government."
    On the afternoon of May 15th, Abe, a representative of the Central Guidance Department of the Japanese Communist Party, Sato, a representative of the Kanto Regional Committee of the Japanese Communist Party, and Aoyagi, a representative of the Japan Lawyers Association for Freedom, went to the Metropolitan Police Department and the Tokyo District Public Prosecutor's Office regarding the Yoshida government's illegal arrest of Matsumoto Mitsugi, and made two oral protests: First, the arrest based on the already expired "Group Control Ordinance" is illegal, and it is hoped that Matsumoto will be released immediately. Second, at 2:00 AM on the 14th, the police searched Matsumoto's residence, kicked down the door and rushed into the room without waiting for the family members to change their clothes, infringing on human rights.
    On the same day, lawyer Aoyagi of the Japan Lawyers Association for Freedom issued a statement saying that the Metropolitan Police Department's only "reason" for arresting Matsumoto was that Matsumoto had not complied with the summons order issued by the Ministry of Justice based on the "Group Control Ordinance." However, various circumstances show that this "reason" is untenable. First of all, MacArthur's "purge" of Matsumoto and others itself violated the Japanese Constitution. Secondly, the "Group Control Ordinance" was originally a law to eliminate Japanese militarist forces, but it was used to suppress democratic political activities, which also violated the Japanese Constitution. Third, the Ministry of Justice fabricated a secret political meeting held by members of the JCP Central Committee at Kinugawa Onsen, and issued a summons order based on it, which was illegal. Fourth, Matsumoto did not receive the summons order from the Ministry of Justice, either directly or indirectly. Finally, the "Group Control Ordinance" is a law that has already expired. Therefore, the Metropolitan Police Department's arrest of Matsumoto Mitsugi has no legal basis and is completely illegal.
    Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: Tokyo News: On May 19th, five representatives from organizations such as the All-Japan Congress of Industrial Unions, the Japan National Relief Association, the All-Japan Construction and General Industry Workers' Union, and the All Japan Communications Workers' Union, submitted protest letters to the Public Security Investigation Agency, the National Rural Police Headquarters, and the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department, respectively, regarding the unreasonable arrest of Matsumoto Mitsugi.
    When representatives attending the Japan Electrical Industry Workers' Union Congress heard the news of Matsumoto Mitsugi's arrest, they donated money to be used as funds to rescue Matsumoto Mitsugi.
    In Kyushu, the Kyushu Regional Committee of the Japanese Communist Party and the Fukuoka Prefectural Committee had already called for launching a movement on May 14th to protest the illegal arrest of Matsumoto Mitsugi and demand his release.
    Xinhua News Agency, 3rd Dispatch: Tokyo News: The Japanese Communist Party and the Japan National Relief Association are conducting rescue activities to demand the release of Kasuga Shoichi, a member of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party who is ill in prison.
    Kasuga Shoichi was illegally arrested by the Yoshida government in October 1950 on the pretext that he had violated the "Group Control Ordinance." For more than two years, due to the harsh conditions of prison life and the persecution of the Yoshida government, Kasuga Shoichi suffered from severe cholecystitis and gastroptosis. If surgery is not performed early, there is little hope of recovery from this disease.
    In order to rescue Kasuga Shoichi and have him released from prison as soon as possible, representatives of the Central Guidance Department of the Japanese Communist Party, Kazahaya Hachijuni, and the Vice Chairman of the Japan National Relief Association, Nanba Hideo, and others, made a request to the prison authorities on May 13th, pointing out that the so-called legal basis used by the Yoshida government to arrest Kasuga Shoichi—the "Group Control Ordinance"—had long been invalid. Therefore, continuing to imprison Kasuga Shoichi is illegal. They demanded that Kasuga Shoichi be released immediately and that they be allowed to send doctors and nurses to the prison to treat and care for Kasuga Shoichi.
    Kasuga Shoichi's wife recently wrote a letter to the Japanese Communist Party's central organ newspaper "Akahata," calling on the Japanese people to launch a movement to demand the release of Kasuga Shoichi, rescue him from prison as soon as possible, and enable him to fight for national liberation together with the Japanese people.

    日本共产党中央指导部发表声明
    抗议吉田政府非法逮捕日共中委松本三益
    【本报讯】据日本“赤旗报”消息：五月十四日，日本共产党中央指导部就十三日吉田政府非法逮捕日本共产党中央委员会委员松本三益同志事件发表声明，全文如下：
    “逮捕我党优秀领导者松本三益同志，不仅是加在松本个人身上的迫害，也不仅是加在日本共产党身上的迫害；而是日趋没落的美日反动派对日本民主爱国力量进行疯狂法西斯迫害的前奏。如果对于非法逮捕松本三益同志事件漠然视之，那就等于容许美日反动派今后对民主政党和民主团体进行法西斯迫害，容许对民主爱国人士加以接踵而来的非法逮捕和压迫。‘团体等规正令’已经失效，逮捕松本同志是毫无根据的。我党现对警察当局非法逮捕松本三益同志提出严重抗议，并要求立即予以释放。同时，号召全国人民，特别是工人、农民、民主党派、民主团体起来广泛地展开反对吉田政府法西斯政策的斗争。”
    五月十五日下午，日本共产党中央指导部代表阿部，日本共产党关东地方委员会代表佐藤，日本自由律师协会代表青柳，为吉田政府非法逮捕松本三益事件前往警视厅及东京地方检察厅，提出两点口头抗议：一，根据已经失效的“团体等规正令”进行的逮捕是非法的，希望立即将松本释放。二，十四日上午二时，警察搜查松本的住宅，不待家人换衣即踢破大门冲入室内，侵犯了人权。
    同日，日本自由律师协会青柳律师发表谈话说，警视厅逮捕松本的唯一“理由”，是说松本没有遵从法务府根据“团体等规正令”发出的传讯命令。但是，多方面的情况说明这个“理由”是不能成立的。首先，麦克阿瑟对松本等的“整肃”，本身就违反了日本宪法。其次，“团体等规正令”本来是为了肃清日本军国主义势力的法令，却被用来压迫民主政治活动，也是违反日本宪法的。第三，法务府捏造日共中央委员在鬼怒川温泉举行秘密政治会议，并据之而发出的传讯命令是非法的。第四，不论是直接的或者间接的，松本都没有接到法务府的传讯命令。最后，“团体等规正令”是已经失效的法律。因此，警视厅逮捕松本三益是没有任何法律根据的，完全是非法的。
    据新华社讯：五月十九日，全日本产业别工会会议、日本国民救援会、全日本土建一般产业工会和全递信工会等组织的五名代表，为松本三益被无理逮捕一事，分别向公安调查厅、国家地方警察本部和东京警视厅提出了抗议书。
    正在参加日本电气产业工会大会上的代表们听到松本三益被捕的消息时，纷纷捐款作为营救松本三益的经费。
    在九州，日本共产党九州地方委员会和福冈县委员会已经在五月十四日号召展开抗议非法逮捕松本三益并要求予以释放的运动。
    【新华社三日讯】东京消息：日本共产党和日本国民救援会为了要求释放在监狱中得病的日本共产党中央委员会委员春日正一，正在进行援救活动。
    春日正一是被吉田政府在一九五零年十月借口他违反“团体等规正令”而非法加以逮捕的。两年多以来，由于监狱的恶劣生活和吉田政府的迫害，春日正一害着严重的胆囊炎和胃下垂病。这种疾病如果不及早施行手术，很难有痊愈的希望。
    为了援救春日正一早日出狱，日本共产党中央指导部代表风早八十二和日本国民救援会副主席滩波英夫等人在五月十三日向监狱当局提出要求，指出吉田政府用来逮捕春日正一的所谓法律根据——“团体等规正令”早已失去效力，因此，继续监禁春日正一是非法的。他们要求立即释放春日正一，并让他们派医生和护士到狱中去为春日正一治病和看护。
    春日正一夫人最近写信给日本共产党中央机关报
    “赤旗报”，呼吁日本人民展开一个要求释放春日正一的运动，早日营救他出狱，使他和日本人民一道为民族解放而斗争。
