We hope that cultural exchanges between our two countries will be strengthened in the future. Just as the delegation is visiting China, a trade agreement has been signed between the governments of China and Finland. The development of trade relations on the basis of equality and mutual benefit, like the promotion of cultural exchanges, is a very good condition for enhancing the welfare of the people of both countries and maintaining lasting peace.

Mrs. Kekkonen said in her reply: "During our six weeks as guests in China, we have gained rich experiences. We have seen your schools, factories, and construction sites, and we see the enthusiasm for construction everywhere.

During the reception, Guo Moruo presented gifts to the Finnish Cultural Delegation. The hosts and guests frequently raised their glasses in a toast to Sino-Finnish friendship.

After the reception, the China Acrobatic Troupe performed wonderful programs.

Xinhua News Agency, June 5th—The Finnish Cultural Delegation, invited by the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs to visit China, held a press conference in Beijing on the afternoon of the 5th. At the meeting, members of the delegation spoke freely about their impressions and feelings gained during their visit to New China and their tour of various places for more than a month.

Mauri Luma, Deputy Head of the delegation, spoke first. He summarized his feelings in four aspects: the stable social order of New China, the sincere friendship of the Chinese people towards the Finnish people, the Chinese people's friendship towards the great Soviet Union, and the Chinese people's determination to defend world peace. He expressed the hope that the common friendship among China, the Soviet Union, and Finland can continue to develop in all aspects. He particularly pointed out that the Sino-Finnish 1953 Trade and Payment Agreement signed today will be the beginning of further development of economic relations between Finland and China.

Subsequently, eleven members of the delegation expressed their feelings.

Professor Wiklund pointed out in his speech that New China's preservation and attention to cultural relics, as well as its research on ethnic minority cultures, gave him a deep impression. He said that this research enriches the common cultural treasures of mankind and creates a harmonious atmosphere among human beings.

Writer Kuren Saari said in his speech: "You are not only managing rivers, building reservoirs and power stations, but also educating a new humanity. You are educating a new person with more humanitarian ideas." He said that he would do his best to tell the Finnish people everything he saw in China after returning home.

Film actress Mrs. Auvinen talked about various Chinese classical and folk dramas. She expressed great hope for the continuation and development of China's national art traditions.

Shoe factory worker Jokinen emphasized in her speech that women in New China have the same status as men and the achievements of women workers' welfare in factories.

Musician Laatjoki said in his speech: "Music can be heard everywhere in China, on construction sites, on the streets, and in train stations." He expressed his interest in the national style of Chinese music.

Journalist, Member of Parliament of the Finnish People's Democratic League, and representative of the Swedish minority in Finland, Backlund, praised New China's ethnic policies in his speech. Doctor Savolainen mentioned in his speech the hospitals for workers and the medical stations in rural areas that the delegation had visited. He believed that all of this proved the government's concern for workers' health care.

Many representatives repeatedly mentioned their feelings after visiting Chinese water conservancy projects and many factories in major cities in their speeches, expressing that they were deeply impressed by the construction enthusiasm and conscious labor of New China's workers.

The representatives also talked about the great importance of the Sino-Finnish 1953 Trade and Payment Agreement signed today in promoting trade and economic exchanges between Finland and China and strengthening the friendship between the Finnish and Chinese peoples.

Mrs. Laurikainen, Secretary-General of the Finland-China Society, spoke last, saying enthusiastically that she would never forget the solemn moment of watching the May Day International Labor Day parade in front of Tiananmen Square. She pointed out that the Finnish Cultural Delegation's visit to New China improved the relations between the Finnish and Chinese peoples, and the Finnish and Chinese peoples have become closer. She said that the delegation will do its best to convey what the delegates saw and heard in China to the Finnish people after returning home.
