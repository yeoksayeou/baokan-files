Xinhua News Agency, Fushun, 4th: The Fushun Mining Bureau has discovered new and rich coal deposits north of the Victory Mine, proving that the ancient coal capital still possesses vigorous youthful vitality.

All geological data left over from the puppet Manchukuo regime stated unequivocally: the north of the Fushun coalfield had a large "fault" equal in length to the coalfield itself, and that there would be no coal at all in the area north of the "fault." In order to thoroughly clarify the geological situation of the coal capital and to carry out overall reconstruction work, the Fushun Mining Bureau began drilling north of the Victory Mine in the third quarter of last year, at distances of 200 meters, 400 meters, 500 meters, and nearly 600 meters beyond the "fault" line. As a result, coal seams dozens of meters thick and oil shale for the oil industry were discovered 500 meters north of the "fault" line, and traces of coal were also found 600 meters north of the "fault" line. Based on the results of this drilling and geological conditions, it is judged that the area and coal reserves of the entire Fushun coalfield will greatly exceed the figures investigated during the puppet Manchukuo period.

Currently, hundreds of technicians and drilling workers are continuing to work intensively in the area north of the Victory Mine. New drilling towers have already been erected. A large number of drilling workers and drilling machines are also about to come here to provide support.

    煤都抚顺发现新煤藏
    【新华社抚顺四日电】抚顺矿务局在胜利矿的北面发现了新的丰富的煤藏，证明古老的煤都还蕴藏有旺盛的青春活力。
    所有伪满遗留下来的地质资料都肯定无疑地说：抚顺煤田的北面有一个与它长度相等的大“断层”，“断层”以北的地区就根本没有煤了。抚顺矿务局为了彻底弄清煤都的地质情况，以便进行总体改造工作，从去年第三季度开始，在胜利矿北面、超出“断层”线二百公尺、四百公尺、五百公尺和将近六百公尺的地方进行了钻探。结果在超出“断层”线以北五百公尺的地方发现几十公尺厚的煤层和制油工业用的油母页岩，在超出“断层”线以北六百公尺的地方，也发现有煤的标志。根据这次钻探的结果和地质情况来判断，整个抚顺煤田的面积和煤的埋藏量，将大大超过伪满时期所调查的数字。
    现在，数百名技术人员和钻探工人正在胜利矿以北地区继续紧张地劳动着。新的钻塔已经矗立起来。大批钻探工人和钻探机也即将到这里来支援。
