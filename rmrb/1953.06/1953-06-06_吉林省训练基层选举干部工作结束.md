    Jilin Province Completes Training of Basic-Level Election Cadres
    Jilin Provincial Election Committee
    The training of general election cadres in Jilin Province began on May 2nd and ended on May 11th. The cadres who participated in the study included: 22 section chiefs and 236 staff members from provincial-level directly affiliated agencies; 11 department heads, 29 section chiefs, 131 division chiefs, staff members, and clerks from various county Party committees; 82 district Party committee secretaries, 163 district heads and district committee members, and 31 staff members and assistants. The political quality of the students was generally high, and most of them met the conditions for being able to specifically grasp basic-level election work after training. The quality of cadres drawn from individual provincial-level agencies was relatively poor, but they could serve as technical cadres.
    The content of the study focused on the Election Law and related documents. Comrades in charge from the provincial Party committee and the provincial government lectured on policy issues; the office of the provincial election committee was responsible for lecturing on business (technical) issues.
    Because the students came from various departments, and the general election was a new task, everyone had inconsistent understandings of the general election work before the start of the study. Cadres from the political and legal departments and responsible cadres from counties and districts were relatively at ease in their studies, but they did not pay much attention to the general election. They believed that the People's Congress was the same as the People's Congresses of the past: easy to convene, with no problems. The deputy secretary of the Yushu County urban district Party committee said: "This general election is just a formality." Cadres from other departments believed that the general election work was a matter for the civil affairs department and had little to do with them. A cadre from the railway department said: "Our central task is the 500-kilometer overload and over-axis movement, and the general election has little to do with us." Some believed that the general election should not be designated as one of the three major tasks in the country in 1953. Some county and district cadres believed: "We should mainly lead agricultural production well. Why are we being transferred to study the general election, which is the work of the administrative department?" In addition, a few comrades from provincial-level directly affiliated agencies were afraid of hardship and unwilling to go to the countryside.
    After several reports after the start of the study, everyone felt that there were many new problems that they did not understand in the past, and they realized that they were the backbone of the basic-level elections, and would lead the work of a district or a village in the future. If they did not study well and could not grasp the policies, they would make mistakes. They began to pay attention to the study of election documents, seriously debated issues in group meetings, and studied the documents in detail. A total of 305 difficult questions related to population surveys, voter registration, and elections were raised, and preliminary solutions were obtained through study.
    Regarding the issue of population surveys, everyone recognized three points: First, to conduct elections, voter registration work must be done well, and voter registration must be based on accurate population figures; therefore, population registration must be carried out simultaneously with voter registration. Second, this year is the first year of our country's first Five-Year Plan, and population figures are necessary as a foundation for economic and cultural construction work. Third, population surveys and registration must be done to ensure "no duplication and no omissions." During the discussion, everyone conducted detailed research on some complex and specific issues such as age and nationality, some of which were answered by the leadership; some have been requested to the higher authorities. In terms of practice, they studied how to distinguish between permanent residents and those who are away from home. In order to make population registration simple and easy, and not to affect mass production, the registration method of "mobile registration stations" (a combination of fixed-point registration and door-to-door registration) was proposed. After discussion, everyone agreed that this method was feasible.
    In terms of voter registration, the focus was on resolving the issue of voter qualification review, clearly implementing the spirit of the central government's instruction that "we must not allow a reactionary element or a member of the landlord class who has not been reformed to illegally steal solemn political rights, nor can we allow a citizen to be wrongly deprived of solemn political rights," correcting the dissatisfaction of some county and district cadres with the change of the status of landlords and rich peasants and the restoration of their political rights, and distinguishing between the reactionary behavior and the law-abiding behavior of landlords and rich peasants.
    In terms of basic-level elections, everyone clarified the procedures for basic-level elections. And solved two main problems: The first was to recognize that the People's Congress is the basic system of our country by explaining the differences in the generation, nature, and significance of the representatives of the People's Congress and the People's Congress. The second was that some people believed that it was undemocratic to adopt the method of the rural election committee inviting representatives of the Communist Party organizations and various people's organizations to propose candidates for representatives. After discussion, it was recognized that the list of candidates proposed by the higher authorities was only a preliminary opinion, provided for voters to consider, and its purpose was to assist voters in considering the breadth and representativeness of the representatives, and to guide voters to elect those who everyone truly believes are satisfactory and necessary. As for whether they are elected, it is up to the voters to democratically discuss and elect.
    During the study, everyone also discussed how to combine election work with production. At the beginning, some people believed that doing a good job in the general election could inspire the enthusiasm of the masses and promote production, but the election work itself would always affect production. Some people proposed: "It is impossible not to affect production at all." After discussion, everyone clarified the relationship between political power construction and production construction, affirmed that the entire election work should be closely combined with production, and the central government's instructions on taking production as the overriding central task must be implemented. At the same time, three methods were proposed to ensure the combination of general election work and production work: First, cadres participating in election work should be selected as little as possible, or fewer cadres who directly lead production should be selected; second, county and district cadres must emphasize mutual combination when going to the countryside to work, saving time spent with the masses; third, when conducting election work, do not occupy the production time of the masses.
    It is also important to combine basic-level elections with opposing commandism and opposing violations of law and discipline. In this study, in response to the current concerns of village cadres, the idea of ​​"changing shoulders" was mainly resolved. In order to achieve the purpose of educating cadres and improving work, do not put the hat of violating law and discipline on some trivial details of cadres' problems. For those cadres who have committed certain compulsory orders due to urgent tasks, the masses should be told that the higher authorities are responsible, to seek the understanding of the masses; and to educate the village cadres from a positive perspective to earnestly review their mistakes to the masses.
    The experience of Jilin Province in holding basic-level election cadre training is: First, in order to effectively achieve the goal that every student can truly become the backbone of basic-level elections, careful deployment must be made in advance, an education plan must be formulated, and the party and government leaders of the province must serve as lecturers to personally conduct mobilization; this makes it easier to solve difficulties, open up thinking, explain policies clearly, and encourage learning emotions. The office of the provincial election committee also dispatched more than 50 people to fully participate in the work of the training class, and the comrades in charge of academic affairs also specifically grasped the situation of one or two classes. Due to the full support of the leadership and the existence of a specific plan, this training class achieved the expected results.
    Second, because students come from different positions, have varying degrees of proficiency, and have inconsistent ideological understandings, it is necessary to deeply understand the ideological dynamics of the students and solve the ideological problems of the students in a timely manner before the start of the study and during the study. In addition to the training class conducting ideological education, the original agency must explain the importance of participating in election work and the purpose of conducting the study when selecting and sending students. Because individual units have insufficient understanding of one of the three major tasks in the country this year—implementing the general election and convening the People's Congress—they adopted a hasty attitude towards transferring cadres. For example, some agencies just wrote a letter of introduction and sent the person who was transferred without telling them what to do at all; some sent cadres who could not be assigned work; some sent messengers; and some sent sick people, saying, "General election work is nothing, you can work and recuperate at the same time." Because the agency did not explain clearly, some comrades were ideologically confused after arriving at the training class. Some comrades were afraid that participating in the general election work would take a long time and affect their business; some asked to be assigned to the county they wanted to go to; and some said they could not carry their luggage and were unwilling to go to the countryside. In order to stabilize and encourage learning emotions, the provincial responsible comrades personally made a mobilization report in response to the ideological situation of the cadres, which turned the situation around.
    Third, the appropriate composition of classes and groups has a great relationship with learning. At the beginning, seven classes were formed, with four groups in each class (three or four counties). Because the groups were large and the counties were separated, everyone generally felt that learning was inconvenient. After research, it was changed to six classes, with the counties not separated, with seven or eight groups in each class, with about 20 people. The cadres of the provincial-level directly affiliated agencies were mixed into each group. In this way, the county and district cadres have more practical experience, and the provincial cadres accept theories and understand documents faster. The combination of the two facilitates learning. At the same time, the following was taken into consideration when forming groups: the cadres drawn from the province would be assigned to the groups in the county or district they would go to in the future, so that they would have some understanding of the local situation in advance.
    Fourth, in order to meet the requirements of learning and improve the next step of work, it is necessary to solicit opinions on the content of the courses and the teaching methods when the course has progressed to a certain stage. This training class did this. Some proposed that the content of the lectures was not consistent before and after, and some requested that the lectures should have a clear focus. The leadership listened to the students' feedback in a timely manner, studied improvement methods, and gave special answers to the problems that had been lectured on but were still unclear and still had questions.

    吉林省训练基层选举干部工作结束
    吉林省选举委员会
    吉林省训练普选干部的工作于五月二日开始，已于五月十一日结束。参加学习的干部计有：省直属机关科长二十二名，科员二百三十六名；各县县委部长十一名，科长二十九名，股长、干事、科员等一百三十一名；各区区委书记八十二名，区长、区委委员一百六十三名，干事、助理员三十一名。学员的政治质量一般都比较高，大部分都合乎经过训练即能具体掌握基层选举工作的条件。省级个别机关抽调的干部质量较差，但可做技术干部。
    学习内容：以选举法和有关文件为主。有关政策性的问题由省委和省府负责同志讲授；业务性（技术性）的问题由省选举委员会办公室负责讲授。
    由于学员是从各个部门来的，加上普选是件新的工作，因而开始学习前，大家对普选工作在认识上是不一致的。政法部门干部和县区负责干部学习虽比较安心，但对普选都不大重视。认为人民代表大会和过去的人民代表会议一样，好开，没啥问题。榆树县城区区委副书记说：“这次普选还不是形式。”其他部门干部认为普选工作是民政部门的事，与自己关系不大；铁路部门的一个干部说：“我们的中心任务是满载超轴五百公里运动，普选和我们的关系不大”；有的认为：不应把普选定为一九五三年全国三大任务之一。有些县、区干部认为：“我们主要应该把农业生产领导好，搞选举是行政部门工作，为啥调我们学普选？”另外省直属机关的少数同志怕吃苦，不愿下乡。
    学习开始后经过几次报告，大家感到很多都是过去不懂的新问题，并且认识到自己是基层选举骨干，将来要领导一个区或一个村的工作，如果学习不好，掌握不了政策，要犯错误，对于选举文件的学习开始引起重视，在小组会中认真争论问题，对文件研究得细致起来。有关人口调查、选民登记和选举等疑难问题共提出三百零五件，经过学习，都得到了初步的解决。
    对于人口调查问题，大家都认识了三点：一、选举必须做好选民登记工作，而选民的登记，又必须以确实的人口为依据，因此在选民登记的同时，要进行人口登记。二、今年是我国实行第一个五年计划的头一年，为了经济和文化建设工作，必须有人口数字作基础。三、必须使人口调查登记做到“不重复，不遗漏”。大家在讨论中对于年龄、国籍等一些复杂具体的问题，都作了详细的研究，有些领导上作了解答；有些已请示上级。在做法上研究了如何区分常住人口和外出人口。为了在人口登记时简便易行，不影响群众生产，提出“流动登记站”的登记办法（固定地点登记与挨户登记相结合的办法）。经过讨论，大家一致认为这个办法可行。
    在选民登记工作方面，着重解决了选民资格审查问题，明确地贯彻了中央所指示的“不能听任一个反动分子或未经改变成份的地主阶级分子非法窃取了庄严的政治权利，我们也不能听任一个公民被错误地剥夺了庄严的政治权利”的精神，纠正了一些县区干部对改变地主、富农成份和恢复他们的政治权利的不满情绪，区分了地主、富农的反动行为和守法行为。
    在基层选举方面，大家弄清了基层选举的程序。并解决了两个主要问题：第一是通过解释人民代表大会与人民代表会议的代表产生、性质和意义等区别，认识了人民代表大会是我们国家的基本制度。第二是有人认为代表候选人采取由乡村选举委员会邀集共产党组织及各人民团体的代表进行协商的办法提出，是不民主的。经过讨论，认识了上边提的代表候选人名单，只是初步意见，提供选民考虑，其目的是协助选民考虑代表的广泛性和代表性，引导选民把大家真正认为满意的人和必要的人选举出来。至于是否当选，则由选民民主讨论选举。
    在学习中，大家也讨论了如何使选举工作和生产结合起来的问题。开始有人认为普选工作做好了，能启发群众的积极性，推动生产，但是选举工作本身总会影响生产。有人提出：“一点不影响生产不可能。”经过讨论以后，大家明确了政权建设和生产建设的关系，肯定整个选举工作都应密切结合生产，必须贯彻中央关于以生产为压倒一切的中心工作的指示，同时并提出三个办法保证普选工作和生产工作结合：一、参加选举工作的干部尽量不抽或少抽直接领导生产的干部；二、县、区干部下乡工作一定强调互相结合，节省到群众中的时间；三、进行选举工作时，不要占用群众的生产时间。
    基层选举结合反命令主义、反违法乱纪也很重要。在这次学习中，针对目前村干部的顾虑，着重解决了“换肩”思想。为了达到教育干部，改进工作的目的，对干部的一些琐碎细节问题不要扣上违法乱纪的帽子。对于那些因任务紧急而发生某些强迫命令现象的干部，应告诉群众由上级负责，求得群众谅解；并从积极方面教育村干部，对自己的错误认真向群众检讨。
    吉林省举办基层选举干部训练的经验是：一、为了切实达到每个学员都能真正成为基层选举骨干的目的，事前须作周密的部署，制订教育计划，并且由省的党、政负责同志分别担任讲师，亲自进行动员；这样才容易解决困难，打通思想，交清政策，鼓舞学习情绪。省选举委员会办公室并曾抽出五十余人全力参加训练班的工作，教务负责同志亦分别具体掌握一至二个班的情况。由于领导全力支持和有了具体计划，这次训练班才收到预期效果。
    二、由于学员来自不同岗位，程度参差不齐，思想认识也不一致，因此必须深入了解学员的思想动态，在学习开始前以及学习进行中，及时解决学员的思想问题。除训练班应进行思想教育工作以外，原机关在选送学员时必须说明参加选举工作的重要性和进行学习的目的。由于个别单位对今年全国三大任务之一——实行普选、召开人民代表大会的认识不足，对调送干部采取轻率的态度。比如有的机关就是写个介绍信把被抽调的人送来，根本没告诉作什么；有的把分配不了工作的干部送来；有的把通信员送来；还有的把有病的送来，并说：“普选工作没啥，你去一边工作一边休养。”因为本机关没有交代清楚，部分同志到训练班后思想混乱。有的同志怕参加普选工作时间长，影响自己业务；有的要求编到自己想要去的县去；还有的提出背不动行李，不愿意下乡。为了稳定和鼓舞学习情绪，省负责同志针对干部思想情况，亲自作了动员报告才扭转过来。
    三、班、组编得适当，对学习有很大关系。开始时编了七个班，每班（三、四个县）四个小组。由于组大，各县都分开，大家普遍感到学习不方便。经研究后改为六个班，各县不分开，每班七、八个小组，二十人左右。把省直属机关的干部混合编入各个小组。这样，县区干部实际经验较丰富，省里干部接受理论和领会文件较快，两者结合，便于学习。同时在编组时就照顾到：省里抽调的干部将来到那一县、区，就分配到那一县、区的小组中学习，使他们事先对当地情况有所了解。
    四、为满足学习上的要求，并改进下一步工作，在课程进行到一定阶段时，必须征求对课程内容和讲课方法的意见。这次训练班这样做了，有的提出讲课内容前后不连贯，有的要求讲课时中心明确。领导上及时听取了学员反映，研究了改进办法，把已经讲过的课程，还不明确的问题和仍然有疑问的问题，分别作了专门解答。
