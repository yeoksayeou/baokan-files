Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, June 1st. Moscow newspapers have been commemorating International Children's Day for the past two days. The newspapers published starkly contrasting facts, illustrating the completely different situations of suffering children in capitalist countries and happy children in socialist and people's democratic countries. "Pravda" published an editorial on June 1st entitled "In Defense of Children," and printed information about children's situations in various countries under the title "Struggle for Peace, for Children's Life and Happiness." It included a conversation with Li Lilian, Deputy Director of the Women and Children's Welfare Department of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, about the children of New China. Li Lilian said: "Preparing to struggle for the realization of the great Mao Zedong Thought. – Under such a motto our children – our hope and future – are growing and learning."

"Izvestia" published a dispatch from Beijing by N. Klinkin on May 31st, entitled "The Happiness of Chinese Children." The author wrote: I saw the children of free China - children in Beijing, Shanghai, Qingdao, Tianjin, Taiyuan, and other cities, and in the rural areas of Shanxi, Jiangsu, Hebei, Shandong, and other provinces. Everywhere there were happy children. Chinese children are under the care of the Communist Party and the People's Government, and under the love of the whole people.

"Komsomolskaya Pravda" also published information on the happy lives of young pioneers in New China on May 31st.

    莫斯科各报纪念国际儿童节
    【新华社莫斯科一日电】两日来，莫斯科各报都纪念国际保卫儿童日。各报发表鲜明对照的事实，说明资本主义国家苦难的儿童与社会主义、人民民主国家幸福的儿童，处在两种完全不同的境遇。“真理报”六月一日发表“在保卫儿童中”的社论，并以“为和平，为儿童的生活与幸福而斗争”为题登载各国儿童情况。其中刊登了中华全国民主妇女联合会妇女儿童福利部副部长李丽莲关于新中国儿童的谈话。李丽莲说：“准备为实现伟大的毛泽东思想而斗争。——在这样的格言下我们的儿童——我们的希望和未来——成长和学习着。”
    “消息报”五月三十一日发表了纳·克林金自北京的通讯“中国儿童的幸福”。作者写道：我看见了自由中国的儿童——北京、上海、青岛、天津、太原等城市和山西、江苏、河北、山东等省的农村的儿童。到处都是快乐的儿童。中国儿童是处在共产党和人民政府的关怀下，在全民的爱护下。
    “青年团真理报”五月三十一日也发表了新中国少年儿童的幸福生活的资料。
