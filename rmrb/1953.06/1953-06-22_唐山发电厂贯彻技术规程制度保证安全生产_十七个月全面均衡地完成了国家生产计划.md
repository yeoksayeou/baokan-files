    Tangshan Power Plant Implements Technical Regulations and Systems to Ensure Safe Production; Completes National Production Plan Comprehensively and Evenly for Seventeen Months
    The state-owned Tangshan Power Plant earnestly implements technical operating regulations and systems, greatly ensuring safe production. The entire plant once created records of safe operation for 290 days and 251 days, and the machine and boiler workshops even created a new record of 1,045 days of safety without accidents. Due to the guarantee of safety, the entire plant has comprehensively and evenly completed the national production plan for seventeen consecutive months.
    The technical operating regulations of the Tangshan Power Plant mainly include three types: operation, safe operation, and maintenance. According to these regulations, various cards and charts are made and hung on each part of the machine, or concisely printed into various "order tickets" and manuals to carry around, to help employees remember. In addition, a "supervision system" is established, where one person supervises while another performs the operation, to avoid accidents. In this way, with regulations and systems in place, and a set of implementation methods, every employee can perform operations correctly every second, and can quickly handle accidents even if they occur.
    The Tangshan Power Plant implements these regulations and systems on the basis of continuously improving the technical level of its employees. They changed the daily three-shift system to a four-shift system, extracting one shift of workers to take turns for more than a week of training related to technical regulations and systems. Each workshop also organized new and old workers to sign apprenticeship contracts, guaranteeing teaching and learning, and conducting regular assessments. In addition, technical crash courses were opened, hypothetical accident drills were conducted, and amateur technical studies were organized. These measures are very practical and effective.
    In order to ensure the implementation of regulations and systems, the trade union organization of the Tangshan Power Plant also established a meeting system for group production self-inspection. The meeting uses criticism and self-criticism to correct shortcomings such as violations of regulations, lack of seriousness in implementing regulations, and conservative and departmentalist thinking, which has been very effective. For example, Zhang Lantang's group held 26 meetings in half a year, discussing a total of 204 issues related to the implementation of regulations and systems, and carried out commendation, criticism, and assistance in correction at any time. This group used to have many violations of regulations and systems, but now it has become a model group in the entire plant.
    The operation and safe operation regulations of the Tangshan Power Plant have been revised once a year since their establishment in 1950, based on the experience and lessons learned in their implementation. Each time, the ability of employees to implement regulations and systems is improved, and the revised regulations and systems are made more in line with the new situation.

    唐山发电厂贯彻技术规程制度保证安全生产
    十七个月全面均衡地完成了国家生产计划
    国营唐山发电厂认真贯彻技术操作规程制度，大大保证了安全生产。全厂曾创造过安全运行二百九十天和二百五十一天的记录，机、炉两车间更创造了一千零四十五天安全无事故的新记录。由于安全的保证，全厂已连续十七个月全面均衡地完成了国家生产计划。
    唐山发电厂的技术操作规程主要有运行操作、安全运行、检修等三种。根据这些规程，还制成各种卡片、图表挂在机器的每个部分，或扼要印成各种“命令票”、手册随身携带，以帮助职工记忆。此外还订有“监护制度”，一人进行操作时一人在旁监护，以免发生意外。这样，有了规程制度，有了一套执行办法，就使每个职工每一秒钟都能做到正确地进行操作，即使发生事故也能迅速处理。
    唐山发电厂是在不断提高职工技术水平的基础上，贯彻这些规程制度的。他们把每日三班制改为四班制，从中抽出一班工人轮流进行一周以上有关技术规程制度的训练。各车间又组织新、老工人订立师徒教学合同，包教包学，定期考核。此外还开办技术速成班，进行假想事故大演习，组织业余技术学习等。这些措施都很切实有效。
    为了保证规程制度的贯彻，唐山发电厂的工会组织还建立了小组生产自我检查的会议制度。会议运用批评和自我批评方式，纠正违反规程、执行规程不严肃和保守思想、本位思想等缺点，收效很大。如张兰堂小组半年中开会二十六次，共讨论了有关执行规程制度的问题二百零四件，随时进行表扬批评和帮助纠正。这个小组过去违反规程制度的事情不少，现在已成为全厂的模范小组。
    唐山发电厂的运行操作和安全运行两种规程，从一九五○年建立以来，每年都根据执行中的经验教训修订一次。每次都使职工执行规程制度的能力提高一步，并使修订出来的规程制度更能符合新的情况。（据新华社讯）
