Preliminary Experiences in Organizing Handicraft Production Cooperatives in Tianjin

Since June 1949, the Tianjin Cooperative General Office has been organizing handicraft production cooperatives in the city through voluntary association. The initial targets were independent handicraft laborers, household sideline producers, and some unemployed handicraft workers in industries such as cotton weaving, knitting, carpets, and drawn-thread embroidery. By the end of April this year, there were 38 handicraft production cooperatives, covering 15 industries including sheet metal, sewing, canvas, toothbrushes, hemp rope, woodwork, tires, towels, and fishing. The number of members reached 5,488, with a total share capital of 640 million yuan and accumulated surplus of 4.39584 billion yuan, representing significant growth compared to 1950. The situation this year is even better, with the total product value for January to April alone reaching over 33 billion yuan, nearly doubling the same period in 1952. The products of these production cooperatives have played a certain role in supplying industrial and agricultural production and meeting the needs of the people's lives.

These production cooperatives developed under the support of the People's Government in various aspects such as bank loans, processing orders, and tax preferences. For example, last October, over 74 percent of the products of various cooperatives were ordered or purchased by state-owned enterprises, thus solving the problem of sales.

These production cooperatives changed the original production relations in handicraft workshops, established cooperative relations where everyone participates in labor and a democratic system where everyone participates in production management, and brought into play the enthusiasm and creativity of producers. For example, the Tianjin Male Labor Carpet Production Cooperative was formed by small handicraft households with low production volumes, high expenses, and frequent inability to produce normally, as well as some scattered workers. Five months after establishing the cooperative, due to everyone's active production, the output increased by an average of two times compared to before, the quality gradually improved, and raw materials were rationally saved, reducing production costs. The cooperative has now developed into a carpet factory with 471 rooms. Except for spinning, the entire production process from yarn to finished product and production tools are all owned by the cooperative. Members are also very active in improving tools. Last year, member Yang Tingfang created a hand-cranked yarn joining machine, which increased production by 60 percent. Currently, the cooperative has developed to more than 1,400 members, and the capital has gradually increased to over 1.13 billion yuan. With the development of production, the lives of the members have greatly improved.

Some production cooperatives have accumulated capital and, in line with the development of production, have begun to add new machinery and equipment. For example, the Third Knitting Production Cooperative had no production tools when it opened, only 33 borrowed machines. After more than a year of operation, it now not only owns 103 machines, but the workshop has also increased from 12 rooms to 102 rooms, and advanced production equipment such as electric steam dyeing, electric baking, and dewatering machines have been added. For example, in order to further develop production, the Sheet Metal Products Production Cooperative has purchased an electric pounding machine, an electric square vehicle, a cutting knife, and three sets of steel molds, gradually developing from handicraft to mechanization.

Over the past few years, Tianjin has gained the following preliminary experiences in organizing handicraft production cooperatives:

1.  The organization of handicraft production cooperatives must be carried out step by step and in a planned manner. First, key industries should be selected for focused organization, and they should be organized gradually from the lower level to the higher level. This is because everyone is still in the exploratory stage of organizing handicraft production cooperatives and lacks systematic experience; and this work is extremely complex, so it is essential to proceed cautiously, steadily, and with a focus on organization and development. If organization is carried out universally regardless of the existing conditions, even if cooperatives can be organized, they will not be consolidated.

2.  Organizing handicraft production cooperatives is also a process of mobilizing and educating the masses, which is a patient and meticulous mass work. Only after some arduous but also necessary mass work can the enthusiasm and initiative of handicraftsmen in organizing production cooperatives be fully brought into play; can the cooperative be well organized and consolidated and developed. The attempt to rely on administrative orders or simple appeals, violating the principle of voluntary mutual benefit of handicraftsmen, and adopting coercive measures to carry out organization, without being willing to mobilize and educate the masses in a long-term and patient manner, will surely fail. In the process of mobilizing and educating the masses, two deviations must also be prevented: one is to carry out empty propaganda without basing it on the actual situation and without targeting the ideological situation and requirements of the handicraftsmen. This kind of propaganda is not easily accepted by the masses. For example, when some districts organized production cooperatives, they did not fully deliberate in advance, but simply convened a meeting, vaguely talked about the nature, organizational principles, advantages, etc. of the cooperative, and then asked everyone to go back and fill out a form to participate. As a result, because they did not proceed from reality and effectively solve ideological problems, no one came to participate after the meeting. The other is that the propaganda is not realistic, and the benefits of production cooperatives are exaggerated too much, and the possible difficulties after organizing cooperatives are not clearly explained to the masses. This will cause some people to become disappointed and dissatisfied with the difficulties that may be encountered in the early stage of the cooperative after joining the cooperative, affecting the consolidation of the cooperative.

In the process of organizing production cooperatives, the support and assistance of the government's industrial and commercial departments and higher-level cooperatives are necessary, but it is necessary to prevent monopolization and substitution, so as not to affect the full play of the enthusiasm of the masses.

3.  The cooperative must promote democratic life within the cooperative. Because only by promoting democracy within the cooperative can the members truly realize that "everyone is the master" and everyone has a responsibility. Small handicraftsmen have long been engaged in decentralized and independent small production, and have developed the habits of freedom and looseness. They are unfamiliar with democratic life. Therefore, the democratic life of members must be gradually cultivated. For example, regularly convene general meetings of all members and representative meetings, elect responsible cadres within the cooperative by the members, and use these meetings to listen to reports on cooperative affairs, financial reports, check the work of responsible cadres, discuss the cooperative's operating policies and business, and carry out criticism and self-criticism among the members, using self-education methods to gradually improve the awareness of all members. Only in this way can the cooperative move towards consolidation and further development.

4.  Another important issue in consolidating production cooperatives is the need to establish a reasonable system for paying labor compensation. The many egalitarian tendencies that still exist must be corrected. Because this unreasonable system not only affects the enthusiasm of members to improve production and improve quality, but also causes many opinions among members, which will affect labor discipline. Therefore, it is necessary to establish a scientific and reasonable system for paying labor compensation in accordance with the principle of "distribution according to labor," and to determine different remuneration levels according to different conditions such as labor technology, position in production, and labor complexity.

5.  After the cooperative is organized, it is necessary to establish a management system gradually from the actual situation. It should not be rushed and the requirements should not be too high. Under possible conditions, efforts should be made to centralize production as much as possible in order to carry out scientific management, save cadre strength, reduce expenses, and give full play to production potential. If conditions do not allow for complete centralization, semi-centralized or decentralized production is also possible, but unified operation and management must be achieved, including unified calculation of profits and losses, unified product specifications, unified regulations on quantitative standards for raw materials and products, and a system of responsibility for members to deliver goods on time, unified wage standards, and so on. As for sideline production, it is necessary to decide whether it needs to be centralized production based on the actual situation. For example, the drawn-thread embroidery industry is mostly sideline production for housewives. They engage in production at home on the one hand, and take care of children and household chores on the other hand. Centralized production is difficult, so it is not necessary to centralize production.

6.  After the production cooperative is organized, it is necessary to continuously improve production technology and improve product quality in order to open up sales channels and enable the cooperative to develop. For example, the Third Knitting Production Cooperative mobilizing its members to study technology, exchange experiences, etc. are all good methods and can be promoted in other cooperatives. In opening up sales channels, various contacts should be established with state-owned trading institutions and consumer cooperatives, and production, sales, and supply contracts should be signed.

At present, there are still many problems with handicraft production cooperatives in Tianjin. For example, some democratic institutions are unsound; some do not have formal cooperative charters; some still have unreasonable egalitarian wage systems, etc. These all hinder the further development of production cooperatives. In order to help them develop normally, the Tianjin Cooperative General Office began to rectify the work of production cooperatives in May. (According to Tianjin Daily News)

    天津市组织手工业生产合作社的初步经验
    天津市合作总社从一九四九年六月起，即以自愿结合的方式，开始在本市组织手工业生产合作社。当时所组织的对象多为棉织、针织、地毯、挑补花等行业独立的手工业劳动者、家庭副业生产者以及部分手工业失业工人。到本年四月底为止，手工业生产合作社已有三十八个，包括有白铁、缝纫、帆布、牙刷、麻绳、木器、轮带、毛巾、渔业等十五个行业。社员人数共达五千四百八十八名，股金总值六亿四千万元，盈余积累达四十三亿九千五百八十四万元，较一九五零年有了很大的发展。今年的情况更好，仅一至四月份的产品总值已达三百三十多亿元，比一九五二年同期增加了近两倍。各生产合作社的产品在供应工、农业生产和人民生活需要上都起了一定的作用。
    这些生产合作社，是在人民政府给予银行贷款、加工订货及税收照顾等各方面的扶助下，发展起来的。如去年十月各社的产品有百分之七十四以上是由国营企业订货或收购，从而解决了销路问题。
    这些生产合作社，改变了原有的手工业作坊中的生产关系，建立了人人参加劳动的合作关系和人人参加生产管理的民主制度，发挥了生产者的积极性和创造性。如天津市男工地毯生产合作社，是由一些生产量低、开支大而经常不能正常生产的小手工业户和一些零散工人组成的。他们建社五个月后，由于大家积极生产，产量较前平均增加了两倍，质量也逐渐提高，而且还合理地节省了原材料，降低了生产成本。现该社已发展成为有厂房四百七十
    一间的地毯工厂。除纺线之外，由毛线到成品的整个生产过程与生产工具，全部都归社有。社员对改进工具也很积极，去年社员杨庭舫创造了手摇合线机，产量提高了百分之六十。目前该社社员已发展到一千四百多人，资金逐渐增加到十一亿三千多万元。随着生产的发展，社员生活有了很大的改善。
    有些生产合作社积累了资金，配合生产的发展，开始增添了新的机器设备。如第三针织生产合作社，开业时根本没有生产工具，只有借到的三十三台机子，经过一年多时间的经营，现在不仅自己拥有机子一百零三台，工房也由十二间增到一百零二间，还添设了电力气染、气烤、甩水机等进步的生产设备。又如白铁制品生产社为了进一步发展生产，已购置了电力捣机一台，电力方车一台，裁刀一台，钢模型三套，逐步由手工业向机器化发展。
    几年来，天津市在组织手工业生产合作社方面取得下面几点初步经验：
    一、组织手工业生产合作社必须有步骤、有计划地进行。首先应选择重点的行业进行重点组织，由低级到高级，逐步地组织起来。这是因为大家对于组织手工业生产合作社的工作，还是处于摸索阶段，缺乏系统的经验；而这一件工作又是极为复杂的，所以慎重稳步地、有重点地进行组织与发展是十分必要的。如果不顾现有条件而普遍进行组织，即使合作社能组织起来，也是不能巩固的。
    二、组织手工业生产合作社，也是一个发动群众、教育群众的过程，是耐心的和细致的群众工作。只有经过一些艰苦的但同时也是必要的群众工作以后，才能充分地发挥手工业者对于组织生产合作社的积极性与主动性；才能够把合作社组织得很好，并且使之巩固和发展起来。那种不愿意长期地、耐心地发动群众和教育群众，而企图依靠行政命令或简单的号召，违反手工业者自愿互利的原则，采取强迫命令的办法去进行组织，结果一定会失败的。在发动群众与教育群众的过程中，还必须防止两种偏向：一种是不根据实际情况，不针对手工业者的思想情况和要求，只进行空泛的宣传。这种宣传，群众就不容易接受。如有的区在组织生产合作社时，事先不充分酝酿，只凭召集一次会议，空洞地讲了些合作社的性质、组织原则、优越性等等，就让大家回去后填表参加。结果，由于没有从实际出发，切实解决思想问题，会后竟没有一个人来参加。另一种是进行宣传时不实事求是，而过分夸大生产合作社的好处，对于在组织合作社以后可能发生的若干困难，不向群众讲清楚。这就会使有些人在入社后，对合作社成立初期所可能遭遇的困难发生失望和不满，影响合作社的巩固。
    在组织生产合作社的过程中，政府的工商部门和上级合作社的支持和帮助是必要的，但须防止包办代替，以免影响群众积极性的充分发挥。
    三、合作社必须发扬社内的民主生活。因为只有发扬社内的民主，才能真正使社员体会到“人人作主人”，大家有责任。小手工业者长期从事分散、独立的小生产，养成了自由、散漫的习惯，他们对于民主生活是生疏的，因此，社员的民主生活必须逐渐养成。如定期召开全体社员大会、代表会，由社员选举社内负责干部，并经过这些会议来听取社务报告、财务报告，检查负责干部的工作，讨论全社的经营方针及业务，展开社员间的批评与自我批评，用自我教育的方法，来逐步地提高全体社员的觉悟。这样才能使合作社走向巩固和进一步地发展。
    四、巩固生产合作社的另一个重要问题是必须建
    立合理的支付劳动偿还金制度。对于目前仍然存在的许多平均主义倾向，必须加以纠正。因为这种不合理的制度不但影响了社员提高生产、改善质量的积极性，并且会引起社员之间的许多意见，会影响劳动纪律。因之，必须要遵照“按劳取酬”的原则，建立科学的合理的支付劳动偿还金制度，按劳动技术，在生产中的地位以及劳动的繁简等项不同条件来确定不同的酬劳等级。
    五、合作社组织起来以后，要从实际出发，逐步地建立管理制度，不可操之过急，要求过高。在可能的条件下，应当尽量争取集中生产，以便进行科学管理，节省干部力量，减少开支，发挥生产潜力。如条件不容许全部集中，半集中或分散生产也可以，但必须统一经营管理，做到统一计算盈亏，统一产品规格，统一规定原料产品的定量标准，以及社员按期交货的责任制，统一工资标准等等。至于副业性的生产，则必须根据实际情况，决定是否需要集中生产。如挑补花行业，多系家庭妇女的副业生产，她们一方面在家中从事生产，一方面还要带孩子和料理家务，集中生产是有困难的，就不必集中生产。
    六、生产合作社组织起来以后，要不断提高生产技术，改进产品质量，这样才能打开销路，使合作社得到发展。如第三针织生产合作社发动社员群众来钻研技术，交流经验等等，都是好办法，可以在其他社推广。在打开销路上，应和国营的贸易机构及消费合作社建立多种联系，订立产、销供应合同。
    目前天津市的手工业生产合作社也还有不少问题。如有的民主机构不健全；有的还没有正式的社
    章；有的还有不合理的平均工资制度等。这些都阻
    碍了生产合作社的进一步发展。天津市合作总社，为
    了帮助他们正常的发展，已于五月份开始进行整顿
    生产合作社工作。（据天津日报讯）
