The Diku Highway runs southwest from Dihua, traversing the Victory Daban (formerly known as Xin Daban) on the main peak of the Tianshan Mountains at an altitude of 4,100 meters, directly reaching Kurle. The total length is 321 kilometers. Except for the 65-kilometer section from Hejing to Kurle, which has not yet been completed, the entire road project was constructed in two sections, north and south, and was officially opened to traffic on November 3, 1952.

We set off by car from Dihua, along the brand-new Diku Highway, crossing mountains and rivers, traversing the Victory Daban at an altitude of 4,100 meters, and heading straight to the end of the highway. The scenery along the way is beautiful. At the foot of the mountains, the river roars, stirring up clouds of mist. On the mountainside and along the riverbanks, pine and fir trees grow densely, beautifully green. Elm trees, birch trees, poplars, and wild fruit forests grow densely in the mountains, and the tents and temples of Kazakh and Mongolian compatriots are often revealed in the forests.

On the Diku Highway, we saw grain, cotton, wool, sheep casings, and other products from southern Xinjiang flowing continuously to Dihua, and native products, industrial goods, agricultural machinery, and farm tools from northern Xinjiang being transported to various parts of southern Xinjiang day and night. The brotherly ethnic groups who have lived in the deep mountains for a long time began to receive newspapers, magazines, and books sent by Dihua on this road. State-owned trading companies directly delivered large quantities of rice, flour, tea bricks, and cloth to various pastoral areas, and traded them for cattle, sheep, and horses from the herdsmen. The herdsmen smoothly drove their livestock to Dihua for sale on this road, which has improved their economic and cultural lives day by day. They said, "The Diku Highway has done a great thing for the people in the mountains!"

The completion of the Diku Highway is a road woven with diligence and wisdom by border soldiers with the support of people of all ethnic groups. The heroic deeds of the road-building border soldiers are being spread here.

The days when the construction of the Diku Highway began were in January, the coldest season in Xinjiang. On the Tianshan Mountains, where cliffs and trees abound, everything was covered with white snow, and the climate was thirty to forty degrees below zero. The Victory Daban, at an altitude of 4,100 meters, was completely frozen into an iceberg. Not to mention human traces, even birds and animals were extinct. The people's soldiers, Chairman Mao's good soldiers, in order to realize the wishes of all ethnic groups in the motherland, began fighting through the ice-bound cliffs as if they were fighting a war. If the mountain blocked them, they would flatten it. If the trees blocked them, they would cut them down. If stubborn rocks blocked them, they would kick them away. They used their labor, courage, and wisdom to break the mystery of the Tianshan Mountains and opened up roads on the Victory Daban, where the air was thin and birds and animals were extinct. Bridges were built over the riverbed between the cliffs and steep walls of the two mountains. In order to solve the difficulty of transporting wood on the cliffs, they created a method of transporting wood by sitting on iron ropes. In order to solve the difficulty of quarrying stones on the cliffs, they created a method of suspending people and rafters. In the explosion of stone mountains, they created a five-hit method for drilling medicine holes (namely, steady, flat, accurate, ruthless, and fast). The border soldiers conquered nature with such tenacious will and built this road to create happiness for the people.

Here, many stories of people of all ethnic groups supporting the road-building troops are also often told. During the road construction process, due to the extension of the construction route, the supply and transportation of supplies to the troops became difficult. The people of all ethnic groups along the way shouted such slogans: "Chairman Mao's army is creating happiness for us, and we must fully support our dear ones." They launched a wave of enthusiasm for supporting road construction. The people of Baluntai District in Hejing County mobilized 60 camels to take on transportation tasks. The people of the first, second, third, and fourth districts of Hejing County made more than 1,100 pairs of leather boots and 1,045 pairs of felt socks, and prepared a large amount of firewood and cow dung. They held meetings to study and formulate plans to ensure the supply of supplies to the road-building troops and solve transportation difficulties. Men, women, old, and young in every village, in addition to continuing their own production, organized themselves to go up the mountains to chop firewood and transport grain. Old ladies made leather boots, and children delivered boiled water, danced, and sang at the construction site.

Speaking of the herdsmen's love for the Diku Highway, one cannot help but recall the grand occasion on the day of the opening. Last November 3rd was a sunny day. Although the mountains were already dressed in white, the weather was not too cold. Nearly a hundred cars, loaded with wool, sheepskin, cotton, and food, drove from southern Xinjiang to northern Xinjiang via the Diku Highway. The people along the way, who had rarely seen or never seen a car before, regarded it as a great event! Men, women, old, and young put on all kinds of new clothes and lined up in countless welcoming lines. Mongolian compatriots happily performed Yangko dances. Knights galloped from dozens of miles away to watch. Lamas from Baluntai, dressed in red and purple grand dresses, stood excitedly in the welcoming ranks. As soon as the convoy appeared on the grassland densely covered with yurts, applause and shouts thundered. The folks handed the prepared boiled water and yogurt to the drivers to drink. The drivers invited them to sit in the car for a while, and they shouted, "We are riding in Chairman Mao's car!" Every excited heart and every smiling face showed the feelings of all ethnic groups for this highway!

    给新疆各族人民带来幸福的迪库公路
    田承基
    迪库公路由迪化西南穿越拔海四千一百公尺的天山主峰胜利大坂（原名新大坂），直达库尔勒。全长三百二十一公里，除和靖至库尔勒一段六十五公里尚未修成外，全路工程分南北两段兴修，于一九五二年十一月三日正式通车。
    我们乘汽车由迪化起程，沿着崭新的迪库公路，穿山涉水，翻越拔海四千一百公尺的胜利大坂，直向公路尽头奔去。沿途风景优美。山脚下，河水澎湃，激起团团雾花。山腰及河流两旁，松杉丛生，碧绿可爱。山间密密地生长着榆树、桦树、杨柳及野果林，丛林中时时露出哈萨克及蒙古同胞的帐棚和寺院。
    在迪库公路上，我们看到南疆盛产的粮食、棉花、羊毛、羊肠等，源源不断地流向迪化，北疆的土产、工业品、农业机器、农具，也日夜不停地运到南疆各地。久居深山的各兄弟民族，开始在这条公路上领接迪化送来的报纸、杂志和书籍。国营贸易公司，将大批米、面、茶砖和布匹，直接送到各牧区，与牧民的牛、羊、马匹进行交易。牧民们从这条路上顺畅地赶着牲口到迪化出卖。使他们的经济文化生活日益改善，他们说：“迪库公路可给山里头老百姓办了好事啦！”
    迪库公路修通了，这是边疆战士，在各族人民的支援下，以勤劳和智慧交织成的一条公路。在这儿传诵着筑路的边疆战士的英雄事迹。
    迪库公路开始建修的日子，正是新疆最寒冷的季节——元月份。在悬崖峭壁树木丛生的天山上，到处覆盖着白雪，气候在零下三四十度。拔海四千一百公尺的胜利大坂，整个结成了一块冰山，莫说人迹不到，连鸟兽也是绝迹的。人民的子弟兵，毛主席的好战士，为了实现祖国各族人民的愿望，他们像打仗一样，通过冰封着的悬崖峭壁开始了战斗。山挡住他们，他们就把它炸平。树挡住他们，他们就把它砍掉。顽石挡住他们，他们就把它踢开。他们用自己的劳动，勇敢和智慧打破了天山之谜，在空气稀薄、鸟兽绝迹的胜利大坂上开出公路。在悬崖陡壁的两山夹着的河槽上，架起桥梁。为了解决悬崖陡壁运木料的困难，他们创造了木料坐铁绳的办法。为了解决悬崖半腰打石头的困难，他们创造了吊人吊木椽的办法；在爆炸石山中，创造了打药眼的五打法（即稳、平、准、狠、快）。边疆战士就用这样顽强的意志，征服了自然，给人民修了这条创造幸福的公路。
    在这儿还经常被人传诵着许多各族人民支援修路部队的故事。修路过程中，由于修建路程的延长，部队的给养供给和运输发生了困难，沿途的各族人民喊出这样的口号：“毛主席的军队为我们造幸福，我们要全力支援亲爱的人。”他们掀起支援修路的热潮。和靖县巴仑台区的人民动员六十峰骆驼，担任运输。和靖县一、二、三、四区的人民做了一千一百多双皮窝子，一千零四五十双毡袜子，准备了大量的柴火和牛粪。他们开会研究，订出计划，保证供给修路部队的给养解决运输困难。每一个村落的男女老少，除了继续自己的生产外，都组织起来上山砍柴、运粮，老大娘们做皮窝子，儿童到工地送开水、跳舞、唱歌。
    说到牧民对迪库公路的热爱，不禁使人想起通车那天的盛况。去年十一月三日，是个晴朗的日子，尽管山峦已穿上白衣，但天气还不太冷。近百辆汽车，满载羊毛、羊皮、棉花、食粮，从南疆由迪库公路驰向北疆。很少见过、从来没有见过汽车的沿途人民，将它看作一件大喜事！男女老幼穿起各色各样的新装，摆开无数欢迎的行列。蒙古同胞，高兴得扭秧歌。骑士们从数十里外快马加鞭跑来观光。巴仑台的喇嘛，穿起红色、紫色的大礼服，兴高采烈地站在欢迎行列中。车群刚出现密集着蒙古包的草原上，掌声、喊声就雷动起来。老乡把准备好了的开水、酸奶子递给驾驶员喝。驾驶员请他们坐一段汽车，他们高呼起来：“我们坐了毛主席的汽车了！”每个兴奋的心，每张欢笑的脸，都显示了各族人民对这条公路的情感！
