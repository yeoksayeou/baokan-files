Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, June 27th: TASS Moscow, June 27th: The Political Committee of the British Communist Party issued a statement on the 25th, condemning the provocative actions of the Syngman Rhee clique. The statement also called on the British government to withdraw British troops from Korea.

Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, June 28th: The "German People's Newspaper" published an article on June 26th commemorating the third anniversary of the Korean War, condemning Syngman Rhee for undermining the Korean armistice. The article said: "The whole world is looking forward to the realization of the Korean armistice, but the forces of war still hope for a new opportunity to continue their bloody actions. People all over the world have seen Syngman Rhee's recent reckless behavior; what he needs is to realize his ambition to overcome justice with power."

The article concluded: "The situation in Germany is very similar to the situation in Korea. ... Syngman Rhee's logic is the same as Adenauer's logic, but he has forgotten that the people of all countries in the world, including the German people, have learned a lesson from the three years of the Korean War and are very vigilant. They know that in our time, war cannot solve any problems; only peaceful negotiation can solve problems."

Xinhua News Agency, Prague, June 28th: The Bulgarian newspaper "Workers' Cause" published a commentary on June 21st stating: "Under the deliberate connivance of certain people on the other side of the Pacific, the disgusting actions committed by Syngman Rhee have aroused great indignation in various countries of the world." The commentary believes that, given Syngman Rhee's destructive and war-mongering remarks in the past two years, his current actions are not surprising. However, the actions of Syngman Rhee's ally, the United States, before and after Syngman Rhee's provocative incident deserve serious attention. The American armed forces in Korea watched the "release" of prisoners of war without taking any measures to stop it.

"Workers' Cause" emphasized: "Syngman Rhee's arrogant provocation is a serious obstacle to the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue through negotiation, and a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue is in the interests of the Korean people and peace in the Far East."

    英共政治委员会、柏林“德国人民报”、保“工人事业报”
    斥责李承晚破坏朝鲜停战的挑衅行为
   【新华社二十八日讯】塔斯社莫斯科二十七日讯：英国共产党政治委员会在二十五日发表声明，谴责李承晚集团的挑衅行动。声明并要求英国政府自朝鲜撤退英国军队。
   【新华社柏林二十八日电】“德国人民报”六月二十六日发表纪念朝鲜战争三周年的文章，斥责李承晚破坏朝鲜停战。文章说：“全世界都期待着朝鲜停战的实现，但是，战争势力仍然希望有一个新的机会继续他们的血腥行动。全世界人民都看到了李承晚最近的胡作非为，他所需要的是实现他的以强权战胜公理的野心。”
    文章最后说：“德国的情况与朝鲜情况非常相似。……李承晚的逻辑和阿登纳的逻辑是一样的，只是他忘记了包括德国人民在内的世界各国人民从三年的朝鲜战争中得到了教训并且十分警惕。他们知道，在我们这个时代，战争不能解决任何问题，只有和平协商可以解决问题。”
    【新华社布拉格二十八日电】保加利亚报纸“工人事业报”六月二十一日发表评论说：“在太平洋彼岸的某些人士的故意纵容下，李承晚所干的令人厌恶的勾当，在世界各国引起了极大的愤慨。”评论认为：鉴于李承晚在过去两年中所发表的破坏性的和鼓吹战争的言论，他这次的行动并不令人感到意外。不过，李承晚的盟友美国在李承晚的挑衅事件发生前后的作法却值得严重的注意。朝鲜的美国武装部队眼看着“释放”战俘却不采取任何措施来加以制止。
    “工人事业报”强调：“李承晚的蛮横挑衅是以谈判方式和平解决朝鲜问题的严重障碍，而和平解决朝鲜问题是符合朝鲜人民和远东和平的利益的。”
