    The Marxist-Leninist Night School and Night University attached to the Renmin University of China were established in September 1950. They are part-time political theory schools established based on advanced Soviet educational experience. They both have relatively formal teaching organizations, teaching plans, and teaching systems. Teachers and staff of the Renmin University of China with a certain level of political and cultural knowledge can enroll. For on-the-job cadres from various institutions outside the university who meet the above conditions, the enrollment quota is determined by the CPC Committee of the Renmin University of China, and they are uniformly recommended for enrollment by the CPC Central Committee of the Government Administration Council and the CPC Beijing Municipal Committee, etc. (Currently, due to classroom limitations, it is impossible to enroll a large number of off-campus students.) At present, the Night School and Night University have a total of 1,641 students, including 996 on-campus students (the on-campus students of the Night University are mainly teachers and leading cadres of the university; the on-campus students of the Night School are mainly administrative staff of the university), 645 off-campus students (all of whom are working cadres from the military, institutions, and other schools), and another 183 auditing students.

    The purpose of establishing the Night School and Night University is to systematically improve the political theory level of all teachers and cadres in the university, thereby improving teaching quality and work efficiency. Therefore, when school started in 1950, the study time for the Night School was set at one year, and the study time for the Night University was set at three years. The teaching plan for the Night School was: 1. Fundamentals of Marxism-Leninism, 120 hours; 2. History of the Chinese Revolution, 60 hours; 3. Principles of People's Democracy, 32 hours; 4. Economic Policy of the People's Republic of China, 28 hours. The teaching plan for the Night University was: 1. Political Economy, 228 hours; 2. General History of China, 114 hours; 3. Selected Works of Mao Zedong, 174 hours; 4. Fundamentals of Marxism-Leninism, 114 hours; 5. Dialectical Materialism and Historical Materialism, 54 hours. After more than a year of implementation, it was found that the course load stipulated in the above teaching plan was too heavy. The three courses of the Night School and the two courses of the Night University progressed simultaneously. In addition, students had to read the lecture notes of each course and the necessary reference books for certain courses. Most students felt that there was not enough time and energy to finish reading the designated reference books on time. At the same time, the lecture time was too long, making it difficult for students to endure, which affected the teaching effect. To this end, the CPC Committee of the Renmin University of China studied and revised the teaching plan in September last year and decided that the study time for both the Night School and the Night University would be two years, totaling four years. In terms of courses, the two courses "Principles of People's Democracy" and "Economic Policy of the People's Republic of China" of the Night School were cancelled and allocated to the relevant chapters of Political Economy and other courses. The scientific principles of Marxism-Leninism and the experience of socialist economic construction in the Soviet Union were used to organically link the vivid materials of Eastern European people's democratic countries or the economic policies of the People's Republic of China to explain, in order to enable students to gain a deeper understanding. At the same time, the two courses "General History of China" and "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" of the Night University were cancelled, and the "Fundamentals of Marxism-Leninism" course was taught once in a unified manner. In addition, the method of having multiple courses progress simultaneously in the Night School and Night University was changed to a single method of teaching one course each year. And in order to take care of the teaching and work of teachers and staff during the day, the three-hour class time was shortened to two and a half hours. The current teaching plan for the Night School is: 1. History of the Chinese Revolution, 120 hours; 2. Fundamentals of Marxism-Leninism, 150 hours. The teaching plan for the Night University is: 1. Political Economy, 150 hours; 2. Dialectical Materialism and Historical Materialism, 100 hours. The study period for both the Night School and Night University is two years.

    After one year of implementation of the revised teaching plan, according to the understanding and feedback from all parties, it is more suitable and basically feasible.

    According to the regulations of the CPC Committee of the Renmin University of China on the three-year plan for political theory education for on-the-job cadres, starting from September 1953, the courses will be re-unified and adjusted, and four courses will be offered each year: "History of the Chinese Revolution," "Fundamentals of Marxism-Leninism," "Political Economy," and "Dialectical Materialism and Historical Materialism." Each course will start in September and end in May of the following year. The study time is one year. There will be a test in the first semester and an examination in the second semester. After graduating from the Night School, students can be promoted to the Night University; after graduating from the Night University, students can choose "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" or related theories of socialist economic construction for organized and guided self-study.

    Over the past three years, the Night School and Night University, under the leadership and support of the school's Party committee and school administration, and with the enthusiastic help of Soviet experts and the efforts of all teachers and students, have achieved great results:

    The systematic study of the basic theories of Marxism-Leninism has fundamentally changed the past laissez-faire state of learning for on-the-job cadres, and has cultivated everyone's habit of learning, making political theory learning an indispensable part of daily life. Most cadres can appropriately arrange their work and study, squeeze out time for review and writing classroom discussion outlines; they can overcome various difficulties and persist in learning. Because they understand that only by studying Marxist-Leninist theory and Mao Zedong Thought can they lay a relatively solid foundation for future independent research work.

    The systematic study of the basic theories of Marxism-Leninism has improved the quality of teaching and the political and ideological nature of teaching. Many teachers have reported that after studying political theory, they have strengthened the logic and political and ideological nature of the content of their lectures when preparing teaching materials. At the same time, they have understood how to choose and discard teaching materials and how to use the proletarian standpoint and viewpoint to criticize the decadent and vulgar theories of the bourgeoisie. For example, teachers in the Technical Studies Teaching and Research Section of the Factory Management Department reported that in the past, when they read certain American publications, although they knew that the authors' arguments were wrong, they could not say exactly where they were wrong and did not have the ability to analyze and criticize them. After studying, this situation has changed. Physics and chemistry teachers reported that regarding Newton's discovery of gravity, they often explained it as an accidental phenomenon in the past, saying that Newton discovered it when he saw an apple falling to the ground. After a systematic study of political theory, they knew that Newton's discovery of gravity was not accidental, but a product of social development and production development in the seventeenth century. Mathematics teachers reported that after studying the basic theories of Marxism-Leninism, they had a deeper understanding of mathematical laws, and even positive and negative numbers. Physical education teachers also reported that in the past, everyone said that studying Marxism-Leninism was of great help in improving the quality of teaching, but we were skeptical about this. After studying, we felt that our previous doubts were completely unfounded. Now, we have a deeper understanding of the purpose, principles, and moral style of the new physical education.

    The systematic study of the basic theories of Marxism-Leninism not only helps in teaching work, but also plays a great role in the personal political and ideological training and the improvement of policy level. Teaching staff, after studying, feel that they have many shortcomings. In the past, when personal interests conflicted with overall interests, they often put personal interests first, haggled over personal gains and losses, and put the long-term interests of the people second. After studying, they realized the seriousness and danger of this erroneous thinking and were determined to overcome it. At the same time, teachers and working cadres realized the importance of their work and were determined to do a good job in the school. Due to the improvement of ideological and policy levels, everyone's horizons have broadened, their understanding of problems has become more acute, and they have more ways to deal with problems, and can deeply understand policies and laws.

    In their studies, the vast majority of comrades showed a high degree of enthusiasm, were able to persist in attending classes, and rarely asked for leave or were absent from class, because they deeply felt the importance of theoretical study from their work. However, some comrades did not pay enough attention to theoretical study at the beginning, and under the pretext of heavy teaching tasks, busy work, and poor health, they did not persist in studying well. Individual teachers of technical courses, proceeding from a non-political point of view, believed that the study of political theory had little to do with their professional work, and relaxed the study of political theory. Some comrades had previously studied some political theory in fragments, and when they encountered certain chapters in the course that they vaguely understood, they thought that "the Night University is just the same old thing." They believed that they already had a set of political theory and could cope with teaching work, and that it was enough to improve their technical skills, and the study of political theory could be "put aside." Therefore, they used various subjective and objective difficulties as "shields" and did not want to persist in the study of the Night University. Some comrades underestimated the arduousness of learning, and their performance was that they were tight at the beginning and loose at the end, and retreated when encountering difficulties. Some comrades unilaterally emphasized the benefits of personal self-study and were unwilling to participate in the Night University and were unwilling to be bound by strict learning discipline and learning system. Some comrades had a dependent mentality and asked teachers to solve all problems. They lacked the spirit of independent thinking and hard work.

    The above-mentioned deviations have been basically overcome through the continuous persuasion and education of the Party committee.

    Over the past three years, we have had the following experiences in the work of the Marxist-Leninist Night School and Night University:

    First, practice shows that constantly improving the political theory level of teachers can improve the quality of teaching; and only on the basis of political theory learning can we better learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union. Therefore, the school's Party organization must strengthen its leadership over this work. It is not enough to rely solely on the small number of professional cadres in the Night School and Night University office. The school Party committee should decide on the teaching principles and teaching plans of the Night School and Night University, stipulate the necessary discipline and systems, and decide on important principles such as the number of students to be enrolled. As for daily work, it can be entrusted to full-time cadres in the office. In addition to handling daily work, the Night University office should pay special attention to grasping the attendance of students. It is necessary to go deep into the students in a planned way to understand the situation, check the teaching effect, discover and solve the problems existing in teaching, and promptly study and summarize experience and promote it, in order to continuously improve and improve teaching work. At the same time, each Party branch and directly affiliated branch must designate special personnel to check, supervise, understand the learning situation, and constantly pay attention to and correct the various deviations generated by cadres in the learning process.

    Second, the administrative leadership must attach importance to and support political theory learning, and effectively guarantee learning time. Unless absolutely necessary, do not occupy learning time; at the same time, help solve the practical difficulties encountered by cadres in learning. For example, if some cadres have difficulty persisting in learning due to poor health, they should be dealt with in a timely manner and given appropriate care. Only in this way can the learning of other cadres not be affected. In addition, leading comrades of the administrative departments should take the lead and participate in learning. Facts have proved that the tighter the leading comrades grasp their own political theory learning, the better the learning of their own units can be done.

    Third, the leadership of the Party and the support of the administration can only play a role in promoting political theory learning. To truly master political theory knowledge, it is necessary to rely on the ideological importance of students. In this way, they will take the initiative to arrange work and study, solve the contradictions between work and study in terms of time, formulate self-study plans according to the laws of each person's work, and at the same time, only by attaching importance to learning ideologically can they continuously overcome difficulties, use their brains to work hard, and persist in learning. To learn well, a personal attitude of diligent study is very important.

    Fourth, in terms of teaching, the Night University has adopted a combination of lecturing, self-study, and classroom discussion. Experience has proved that this teaching method is completely suitable for on-the-job cadres. However, the following issues must be paid attention to: 1. Each course of the Night School and Night University should have its own teaching syllabus, which is different from the teaching syllabus of the basic theory course for undergraduates and also different from the teaching syllabus of the basic theory course for specialized courses. Without prejudice to the completeness, systematicness, and logicality of the course, the content of the lectures can be appropriately distributed according to the total number of hours in the teaching plan, and the necessary simplification can be made to certain chapters, and certain chapters or certain issues should be organically linked to reality, compared, and described in detail. Only in this way can the content of the lectures be enriched and meet the requirements of the students. 2. The amount of extracurricular reference books should be small and precise in principle, and the amount of reference books should be stipulated according to the students' self-study time and reading ability. Classroom discussion questions must be appropriate; the teachers who preside over the classroom discussion should preferably be the relevant teaching assistants. There should be strict systems in terms of attendance, tests, and examinations. The opening time of the Night University is best one to two weeks later than the opening time of the school; the examination time should be advanced as early as possible before the semester examination time of the school's undergraduates and specialized courses, so that the teaching staff can take care of the busy work at the beginning and end of the semester, and it is convenient for them to persist in the study of political theory.

    中国人民大学的马克思列宁主义夜校和夜大学
    俞圣祺
    中国人民大学附设的马克思列宁主义夜校和夜大学，成立于一九五○年九月间，这是根据苏联先进教育经验建立起来的业余政治理论学校。它们都有比较正规的教学组织、教学计划和教学制度。凡具有一定政治文化水平的中国人民大学教师和工作人员，都可入学。校外各机关在职干部具有上述条件者，由中共中国人民大学党委决定招生名额，经中共中央人民政府直属机关党委和中共北京市委等统一保送入学。（目前因教室限制，不可能大量招收校外学员。）现在，夜校和夜大学共有学员一千六百四十一人，其中校内学员九百九十六人（夜大学的校内学员主要是学校的教员和领导干部；夜校的校内学员主要是学校的行政工作干部），校外学员六百四十五人（都是部队、机关和其他学校的工作干部），另有旁听学员一百八十三人。
    成立夜校和夜大学的目的，在于系统地提高全校教员和干部的政治理论水平，从而提高教学质量和工作效能。因此，一九五○年开学时，规定夜校的学习时间为一年，夜大学的学习时间为三年。夜校的教学计划为：一、马克思列宁主义基础，一百二十小时；二、中国革命史，六十小时；三、人民民主原理，三十二小时；四、中华人民共和国经济政策，二十八小时。夜大学的教学计划是：一、政治经济学，二百二十八小时；二、中国通史，一百十四小时；三、毛泽东选集，一百七十四小时；四、马克思列宁主义基础，一百十四小时；五、辩证唯物主义和历史唯物主义，五十四小时。经过一年多的实施，发现上面的教学计划所规定的课程分量过重，夜校的三门课程和夜大学的两门课程齐头并进，加之，要阅读各门课程的讲义和某些课程的必要参考书，大多数学员感到时间、精力不够，不能按时读完所指定的参考书。同时授课时间过长，使学员难以支持，影响了教学效果。为此中国人民大学党委在去年九月间研究和修改了教学计划，决定：夜校和夜大学的学习时间各为二年，共计四年。课程方面，把夜校的“人民民主原理”和“中华人民共和国经济政策”两门课程取消，把它们分配到政治经济学和其他课程的有关章节中去，用马克思列宁主义的科学原理和苏联社会主义经济建设的经验，有机地联系着东欧人民民主国家的生动材料或中华人民共和国的经济政策来讲授，以便使学员得到更深刻的理解。同时取消了夜大学的“中国通史”和“毛泽东选集”两门课程，“马克思列宁主义基础”课程则统一起来讲授一次。又把夜校和夜大学多门课程齐头并进的方式，改为每年讲授一门课程的单一方式。并且为了照顾教员和工作人员白天教学和工作的情况，把每次上课三小时缩短为二小时半。现在夜校的教学计划为：一、中国革命史，一百二十小时；二、马克思列宁主义基础，一百五十小时。夜大学的教学计划是：一、政治经济学，一百五十小时；二、辩证唯物主义和历史唯物主义，一百小时。学习期限，夜校和夜大学都是两年。
    修改后的教学计划，经过了一年的实施，据各方面的了解和反映，是比较适合的，基本上切实可行。
    根据中共中国人民大学委员会关于在职干部政治理论教育三年计划的规定，从一九五三年九月起，将对课程重新统一调整，每年开“中国革命史”、“马克思列宁主义基础”、“政治经济学”、“辩证唯物主义和历史唯物主义”四门课程。各课都从九月份开始，到第二年五月结束，学习时间为一年，第一学期要举行测验，第二学期要举行考试，夜校学员毕业后可升入夜大学；夜大学学员毕业后，可选“毛泽东选集”或有关社会主义经济建设的理论进行有组织有领导的自修。
    三年来，夜校和夜大学在学校党委和学校行政的领导和支持下，在苏联专家的热诚帮助和全体教师、学员的努力下，取得了很大的成绩：
    系统的马克思列宁主义基本理论的学习，根本改变了过去在职干部学习的自流状态，并使大家养成了学习的习惯，把政治理论学习当做了日常生活中不可缺少的内容。大多数干部能适当安排自己的工作和学习，挤出时间进行复习、写课堂讨论提纲；他们都能克服各种困难，坚持学习。因为他们懂得，只有学习马克思列宁主义理论和毛泽东思想，才能为今后的独立研究工作打下比较稳固的基础。
    系统的马克思列宁主义基本理论的学习，提高了教学质量和教学的政治思想性。许多教员反映，学习政治理论以后，在编写教材时，加强了讲义内容的逻辑性、政治思想性，同时懂得了怎样取舍教材，如何用无产阶级的立场、观点去批判资产阶级腐朽庸俗的理论。例如工厂管理系技术学教研室的教师反映：过去看了某些美国出版的书籍，虽然知道作者的论点有错误，但说不出究竟错在那里，没有能力去分析、批判它。经过学习，改变了这种情况。理化教师反映：关于牛顿地心引力的发现，以前在教课中往往把它解释为偶然的现象，说是牛顿看到苹果坠地发现的。经过系统的政治理论学习，知道牛顿的发现地心引力并非是偶然的，它是十七世纪社会发展、生产发展的产物。数学教员反映：学习了马克思列宁主义的基本理论以后，对数学中的定律，甚至正负数等都有了更深刻的理解。体育教员也反映：过去大家说学习马克思列宁主义对提高教学质量有重要的帮助，但我们对这一点抱着怀疑的态度。经过学习，觉得以前的怀疑是完全没有根据的。现在，我们对于新体育的目的、方针及道德作风等问题都有了更深刻的理解。
    系统的马克思列宁主义基本理论的学习，不仅对教学工作有所帮助，对个人政治思想的锻炼和政策水平的提高也起着很大的作用。教学工作人员，经过学习，感到自己身上有很多毛病。过去，当个人利益和整体利益发生矛盾时，往往把个人利益放在第一位，斤斤较量个人的得失，把人民的长远利益放到第二位。经过学习，他们认识到这种错误思想的严重性、危险性，决心要克服它。同时，教师和工作干部认识到本身工作的重要性，决心搞好学校工作。由于思想和政策水平的提高，大家的眼界开阔了，对问题的认识就更敏锐，处理问题也更有办法，能深刻体会政策法令。
    在学习中，绝大多数同志表现了高度的积极性，能够坚持上课，很少请假和旷课，因为他们从工作中深深感到理论学习的重要。但有某些同志在开始时对理论学习不够重视，藉口教学任务繁重、工作忙、身体不好，没有很好坚持学习。个别技术课的教师，从非政治观点出发，认为政治理论学习对自己的业务没有多大关系，就放松对政治理论的学习，有的同志过去曾片段地学习过一些政治理论，一遇到课程中某些自己一知半解的章节，就以为“夜大学也不过是那么一套”。他们认为自己在政治理论方面已经有一套了，能够应付教学工作，只要提高技术业务就够了，政治理论学习可以“搁一下”。因此，他们用种种主客观的困难来做“挡箭牌”，不想坚持夜大学的学习。有的同志对学习的艰苦性估计不足，其表现就是在学习上前紧后松，遇难而退。有的同志片面地强调个人自修的收益大，不愿参加夜大学，不愿受严格的学习纪律、学习制度的约束。有的同志有依赖思想，要求教师解决一切问题，他们缺乏独立思考、刻苦钻研的精神。
    上述种种偏向，经过党委不断的说服教育，基本上都克服了。
    三年来我们在马克思列宁主义夜校和夜大学工作方面有下面几点体会：
    第一，实践说明，不断地提高教师的政治理论水平，才能提高教学质量；也只有在政治理论学习的基础上，才能更好地学习苏联先进的经验。因此，学校党组织，必须加强对这一工作的领导，单靠夜校、夜大学办公室的少数专业干部是不够的。校党委要决定夜校和夜大学的教学方针和教学计划，规定必要的纪律和制度，决定招生的人数等重要原则问题。至于日常工作，可委托办公室的专职干部办理。夜大学的办公室除处理日常的工作之外，特别要注意掌握学员的出勤情况。有计划地深入到学员中去，了解情况，检查教学效果，发现和解决教学上存在的问题，及时研究和总结经验，并加以推广，以不断提高和改进教学工作。同时，各党总支和直属支部须指定专人检查，督促，了解学习情况，经常注意和纠正干部在学习过程中产生的各种偏向。
    第二，行政领导方面必须重视和支持政治理论学习，切实保证学习时间，除非万不得已，不占用学习时间；同时，帮助解决干部在学习中所遇到的实际困难问题。例如有的干部因身体不好，难于坚持学习，就要及时处理，给他以适当的照顾。只有这样，才不致影响到其他干部的学习。此外，行政领导同志要以身作则，参加学习。事实证明，领导同志对自己的政治理论学习抓得紧，才能够把本单位的学习搞好。
    第三，党的领导，行政的支持，对政治理论学习只能起推动的作用，真正要掌握政治理论知识，还要靠学员思想的重视。这样，他们才会主动去安排工作和学习，解决工作和学习在时间上的矛盾、按各人工作的规律，拟订自学的计划，同时只有从思想上重视学习，才会不断克服困难，开动脑筋刻苦钻研，把学习坚持下去。要学习好，个人刻苦钻研的学习态度是十分重要的。
    第四，教学方面，夜大学采取了讲授、自修、课堂讨论三者相结合的方法。经验证明，这种教学方法，对于在职干部来说，是完全适合的。但必须注意下面几个问题：一、夜校和夜大学的各门课程应该有它自己的教学大纲，它既不同于本科基本理论课的教学大纲，也不同于专修科的基本理论课的教学大纲。在不妨碍该课程的完整性、系统性和逻辑性等的条件下，可以按照教学计划的总时数，适当分配讲授的内容，对某些章节做必要的精简，某些章节或某些问题，应该有机地联系实际，加以比较，并作详细的讲述。这样才能丰富讲授的内容，切合学员的要求。二、课外的参考书要以少而精为原则，根据学员自学的时间和阅读能力来规定参考书的分量。课堂讨论题必须适当；主持课堂讨论的教员，最好由有关的实习教员来担任。在考勤、测验考试等方面，要有严格的制度。夜大学的开学时间，最好晚于学校开学时间一周到二周；考试时间尽量提早到学校本科、专修科的学期考试时间以前，这样可照顾到教学工作人员学期开始与学期结束工作的繁忙，便于他们坚持政治理论的学习。
