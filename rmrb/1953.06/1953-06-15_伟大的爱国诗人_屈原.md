The Great Patriotic Poet - Qu Yuan
Guo Moruo

Editor's Note: This year, June 15th (Lunar May 5th) marks the 2230th anniversary of the death of our country's great patriotic poet and statesman - Qu Yuan. Qu Yuan was a nobleman of the Chu state during the Warring States period of China, but he consistently opposed the corrupt politics of the Chu dynasty and insisted on his own upright political views. His poem "Li Sao" strongly expresses his patriotic enthusiasm and is an immortal masterpiece of high popular character. The World Peace Council has called on people all over the world to commemorate four great cultural figures in September this year, one of whom is Qu Yuan.

(I)

Qu Yuan is a great poet produced by the Chinese nation. He loved the people, loved the motherland, loved truth and justice, and his poems were filled with this sincere emotion.

He was born in the Chu state during the Warring States period 2292 years ago (340 BC). In terms of ancestry, he was of the same clan as the Chu royal family. The surname Qu comes from the descendants of Qu Xia, the son of King Wu of Chu in the early Spring and Autumn period (7th century BC). Qu was Qu Xia's fief. However, Qu Yuan said in "Xi Song" that his own origin was "humble and poor." This is because "the law of the state of Chu is that land is taken back after two generations of meritorious officials" (Han Feizi: Yu Lao chapter). The fiefdom was only passed down for two generations before the royal family reclaimed the land. Therefore, although Qu Yuan was of the same clan as the King of Chu, he was in fact only equivalent to a commoner of the Chu state.

Because of this relationship, he knew very well the sufferings of the people. Seeing the many disasters and difficulties in people's lives, he often sighed and even shed tears. Later, when he was frustrated and suffered exile, he repeatedly wanted to go to other countries, which was the norm for intellectuals in the Warring States period, but he also thought of the people's suffering and could not bear to leave. He seemed to be particularly sympathetic to the farmers. In "Bu Ju," it was mentioned that Qu Yuan had asked Zheng Zhanyin:

"Would you rather eradicate weeds with a hoe and cultivate the land diligently, or travel among the great to achieve fame?" He listed eight pairs of such opposing questions. The former was what he was willing to do or had already done, and the latter was what he was unwilling to do. If the description in "Bu Ju" is in accordance with the facts, then Qu Yuan was willing to hold a hoe and cultivate the land, and would not be willing to persuade the feudal lords to seek an official position.

Sympathy for the people and love for the people are the basic spirit of Qu Yuan. With this spirit, he was able to win the sympathy of the people, and his poems were able to have abundant life, which stirred up a storm of poetry revolution in the history of Chinese culture and had a profound and long-term impact on the development of literature, so that the Chinese people have been commemorating him for more than two thousand years.

According to the official records of the Han Dynasty, only twenty-five poems by Qu Yuan were left at that time. Fortunately, these twenty-five poems have been preserved to this day without any incompleteness. These are eleven poems of "Nine Songs," nine poems of "Nine Chapters," and one poem each of "Li Sao," "Heavenly Questions," "Summoning the Soul," "Divining a Dwelling," and "The Fisherman," for a total of twenty-five poems. Although Wang Yi of the Later Han Dynasty regarded "Summoning the Soul" as the work of Song Yu and supplemented the doubtful "Distant Journey" to make up the number of twenty-five poems, we can conclude that "Summoning the Soul" is indeed the work of Qu Yuan based on Sima Qian's "Biography of Qu Yuan" and the internal evidence of "Summoning the Soul" itself, and "Distant Journey" is very likely to be the first draft of Sima Xiangru's "Grand Man's Rhapsody." Among these twenty-five poems, there is also a nearly universally accepted view that "Divining a Dwelling" and "The Fisherman" (especially "The Fisherman") were not written by Qu Yuan. However, the rhyme used in them is still the ancient rhyme of the pre-Qin period. I think they should be the works of Qu Yuan's descendants, such as Song Yu, Tang Le, and Jing Cha, who sympathized with Qu Yuan and knew Qu Yuan's life and thoughts well. Therefore, even though these two poems were not written by Qu Yuan, they are still valuable as research materials on Qu Yuan.

According to those most reliable works, we can see that the special quality of Qu Yuan's poems is the very strong atmosphere of the people. First of all, it is worth noting that he adopted the folk ballad style and fully expanded the scale.

Before Qu Yuan, the poems of the ancient aristocratic class in China, such as "Da Ya," "Xiao Ya," "Shang Song," and "Lu Song," as well as some rhyming inscriptions on bronzes since the Spring and Autumn period, regardless of the southern and northern countries, all uniformly adopted the style of four-character poems, which were divorced from the spoken language of the people. By the time of Qu Yuan, although he basically retained the four-character style in a few poems such as "Heavenly Questions," "Summoning the Soul," and "Ode to the Orange," he completely broke this style in other chapters.

The large-scale use of dialects and spoken language is a major feature of Qu Yuan's poems. These words are too numerous to mention. A repeatedly used word "xi" is the best key. The word "xi" is a common word in ancient folk songs, and is also commonly used in "Guo Feng" taken from folk songs. Although this word is now pronounced as "xi," its ancient pronunciation was like "he." Understanding this phonetic trick to read Qu Yuan's works will completely reveal the truth of the folk song quality.

Qu Yuan created a new form in ancient Chinese poetry, and this new form and his feelings and awareness of sympathy for the people and love for the people are exactly complementary. Therefore, Qu Yuan's poems realized the typical unity of content and form.

(II)

Qu Yuan was not only a poet who loved the people, but also a politician with great aspirations.

He was born in the Chu state, so he loved the Chu state. But his love for the motherland surpassed the scope of the Chu state.

Please read his "Heavenly Questions." The more than 170 questions contained in it are mostly about the narration of the entire history of China. The deeds of each dynasty since Yu, Xia, Yin, and Zhou are described in considerable detail, and only four or five sentences are said about the Chu state at the end. Please also read his "Li Sao." It also praises Yao, Shun, Yu, Tang, Gaoyao, Yi Yin, Wu Ding, Fu Shuo, King Wen of Zhou, and Duke Huan of Qi, but there is no mention of the former lords and kings of the Chu state. From here, isn't Qu Yuan's ambition very obvious? Qu Yuan, he not only loved the Chu state, but also loved China.

Although ancient Chinese society before the Spring and Autumn period seemed to be a unified situation, that situation was very small, and in essence it was only a not very close alliance of some large and small clan groups (the so-called "ten thousand states"). Those clan groups governed themselves during the alliance period, especially after the disintegration of the alliance, and carried out their independent or semi-independent development. But one point is very important, that is, the language, writing, and customs were basically developing under a unified form. Therefore, in this long-term individual development, the situation in China grew from small to large, and by the end of the Spring and Autumn period, a more strict demand for unity had generally emerged, the so-called "great unification." The merger of the majority of clan groups since Yin and Zhou into the twelve feudal lords of the Spring and Autumn period, and then the merger into the seven powers of the Warring States period, this trajectory of historical development clearly shows the trend of this "great unification." This is a general demand of the Chinese nation, and almost without exception, it is reflected in the propositions of various schools of thought during the Zhou and Qin periods.

Qu Yuan certainly understood this trend and demand, and developed the ambition to unify China through the Chu state: "Suddenly running around to be ahead, reaching the footprints of the former kings" (Li Sao) - he wanted to rush straight to catch up, assist the King of Chu, and chase after Yu, Tang, Wen, and Wu, who unified China.

To unify China through the Chu state, did the Chu state have such qualifications at that time? This was not purely Qu Yuan's subjective wish.

The Chu state was originally an ally of the Yin Dynasty. After the fall of the Yin Dynasty, it developed independently in the south for hundreds of years during the Zhou Dynasty. By the Warring States period, the entire Yangtze River Basin, Han River Basin, and Huai River Basin had entered the territory of the Chu state. In addition, it also included parts of today's Shaanxi, Henan, and Shandong provinces. The Chu nation made great efforts in the development of southern China. Therefore, among the seven powers of the Warring States period, the Chu state had the largest territory and its military strength was not weak.

Just forty-one or two years before Qu Yuan's birth, King Dao of Chu had reused Wu Qi, and carried out a major reform of internal affairs with swift and decisive measures. "Clearly establish laws and examine orders, reduce unnecessary officials, abolish the distant relatives of the duke's family, in order to nurture soldiers who can fight, the key is to strengthen the army, and break the words of those who advocate diplomacy. Therefore, he pacified Baiyue in the south, annexed Chen and Cai in the north, repelled the three Jin states, and attacked Qin in the west." (Historical Records, Biography of Wu Qi) This is very similar to the style of Qin Xiaogong, who reused Shang Yang twenty years later. Wu Qi and Shang Yang both came from the Legalist school of Wei state. Their propositions and methods were the same, their goals were the same, and their steps were also the same. But soon after the death of King Dao of Chu (381 BC), the reactionary clans of the Chu state shot and killed Wu Qi. Wu Qi's tragedy was the same as Shang Yang's, the only difference being that Shang Yang's tenure was very long (more than twenty years) while Wu Qi's tenure was very short (only about two years). But after Wu Qi's death, more than seventy reactionary parties who shot and killed Wu Qi were punished and completely eliminated. From this, it can be seen that Wu Qi's legacy must have remained in the Chu state.

Qu Yuan grew up precisely in the aftermath of Wu Qi, Shang Yang, and others implementing reforms. Relying on his own talents, he had gained the trust of King Huai of Chu and reached the position of Zuo Tu, second only to Ling Yin, participating in high-level administrative and diplomatic work. His practical statesman's style quite strongly expressed the Legalist color. Please read his "Lamenting the Past." He said: "Alas, I regret that I was trusted in the past, and received the mandate to illuminate the times; presenting the achievements of the predecessors to illuminate the masses, making the legal system without suspicion" (recalling that I was trusted in the past, and received the royal mandate to make the era bright; showing the achievements of the predecessors to the public, making the legal system without suspicion), this is clearly the practice of "clearly establishing laws and examining orders." In what he called "previous achievements," there may be Wu Qi's legacy. Therefore, in addition to this, in the same poem, he advocated "referencing and examining the reality," and opposed "governing against the law." These are the basic propositions of the Legalist school.

However, King Huai of Chu, whom Qu Yuan encountered, could not be compared with King Dao of Chu, whom Wu Qi encountered, or Qin Xiaogong, whom Shang Yang encountered, and therefore he encountered the same tragedy as Wu Qi and Shang Yang. King Huai of Chu was a man with a strong sense of vanity, superficial and indecisive, and arrogant. He easily listened to the slander of the reactionary nobles and alienated Qu Yuan. This king was surrounded by a group of reactionaries, indulged in extravagance and licentiousness, acted rashly, created many enemies, was easily deceived, and was easily provoked. As a result, he was defeated again and again, like a prodigal son, almost ruining the foundation that the Chu state had built up for hundreds of years in his own hands. In the end, he was lured to Qin state as a prisoner for three years, and died in prison in Qin state.

King Qingxiang, the successor of King Huai of Chu, was even more incapable. During his reign, the upright Qu Yuan was further persecuted and exiled. As a result, in the twenty-first year of King Qingxiang (278 BC), Bai Qi, the great general of the Qin state, led his troops south, destroying the capital of Ying, burning, killing, and leveling the tombs of the past kings of Chu. He also drove straight in and occupied Dongting, Wuzhu, and Jiangnan. The ministers of the Chu state fled northeast to Chencheng before they temporarily stabilized, almost to the point of national subjugation.

The country deteriorated to this point, and of course the poet Qu Yuan, who loved his motherland, was most unwilling to accept it. This is the deep root of the heartbreaking pain, depression, indignation, and despair contained in his later poems. After the destruction of Yingdu, he wrote a poem "Lamenting Ying" in his flight to express deep sorrow. He was sixty-two years old at that time. He was fleeing south. The direction of his escape was exactly the direction of Bai Qi's advance. So he escaped to that place, and Bai Qi also chased to that place. This forced him to finally jump into the Miluo River in Hunan province and commit suicide in the year that Yingdu was destroyed.

Qu Yuan's suicide was in fact martyrdom for the national crisis. Obviously, he created himself as a typical tragic figure in a typical tragic era.

(III)

Qu Yuan's talents developed in many directions.

His emotions were sincere, his imagination was rich, and he had the same extremely deep love for natural things. He loved orange trees and praised them, he loved all kinds of fragrant grasses and tried his best to cultivate them, he loved the mountains, rivers, customs, and things of the south, and seemed to be immersed in their essence. He used folk beliefs to personify the mountains, rivers, customs, and things, and personified them very gracefully. Wushan has female ghosts, Xiangshui has goddesses, the sun and clouds have male or female masters, and often deep love occurs between gods and humans or between gods and gods.

Natural phenomena, especially the phenomena of the heavens, after being personified by him, were sometimes driven by him, served him, or drove chariots, or acted as ceremonial guards, or served as guards. This allowed him to break away from the mundane world and fly in the sky - sometimes flying to the gate of heaven, sometimes climbing to the roof of the world, sometimes running to the edge of the western sky, to pursue the ideal paradise and the ideal king who "can work together to create beautiful politics." The king he idealized was symbolized by "beauty." But he did not find such a paradise and "beauty" in heaven or on earth.

Although he acknowledged folk beliefs, he did not have the slightest belief in supernatural beings such as gods and ghosts. He was skeptical and sometimes even hated the supernatural world. Please read "Heavenly Questions." There are these words: "Heavenly fate is reversed, what help and what punishment? Duke Huan held nine meetings, and died suddenly!" This is speaking out for Duke Huan of Qi, which is equivalent to saying that there is no "heavenly fate." There is a description of heaven in "Summoning the Soul," but the scene of that heaven is like hell, not a place where the soul can be at peace. In "Li Sao," the poet flew to the gate of heaven and asked the gatekeeper to open the door, but the gatekeeper leaned against the gate of heaven and looked, refusing to open it for him. This shows that heaven is as snobbish or corrupt as the palaces on earth.

Most noteworthy are the questions about the celestial bodies at the beginning of the "Heavenly Questions" chapter. He is asking: What was the situation before heaven and earth were opened up? Who created the celestial body? Why is it divided into twelve equal parts? Why don't the sun, moon, and stars fall? How many miles does the sun travel in a day? Where does it hide at night? Why does the moon have phases of waxing and waning? - He asked very realistically. This shows that Qu Yuan did not always treat natural phenomena with the poet's fantasy, but sometimes explored the truth with the attitude of a scientist.

Inquiring about celestial bodies was a fairly common question in Qu Yuan's era. Zhuangzi's "Heavenly Movement" chapter begins by asking: Is the sky moving? Is the earth still? Are the sun and the moon racing there? Who is in charge? Who is pulling the strings? Who is playing tricks with nothing to do?

There is also a story from Zhuangzi's "Under Heaven" chapter, which says that there was a strange man in the south named Huang Liao who asked "the reason why heaven and earth do not fall and sink, and the reason for wind, rain, thunder, and lightning." Hui Shi, a scholar from the north, a leader of the School of Names (a school of logic in the Warring States period), who had been the prime minister of the state of Liang (Wei), "answered without hesitation and without thinking, and explained everything."

These all indicate that the scholars of Qu Yuan's time were generally concerned about the operation and structure of celestial bodies. In this regard, Qu Yuan was undoubtedly influenced by the trend of the times.

The era in which Qu Yuan lived was a golden age of brilliant culture in Chinese history. Outstanding thinkers, politicians, writers, and scientists (astronomy, calendrical calculations, etc.) emerged in large numbers, truly presenting a magnificent scene of a hundred flowers blooming. With his talents and status, Qu Yuan was easily influenced by various schools of thought, which allowed him to develop in many directions. But without a doubt, his contribution to poetry was particularly outstanding.

Although only a little over twenty of his poems have been preserved, the content is incomparably rich. There is the level and simple "Ode to the Orange," the fresh and exquisite "Nine Songs," the strange and gorgeous "Summoning the Soul," the majestic and peculiar "Heavenly Questions," and the grief and anger like thunder and lightning, the melancholy yet unrestrained, grand "Li Sao" and most of the "Nine Chapters." The sincerity of emotion, the freedom of imagination, the richness of the vocabulary, the sonorous rhythm, and the diversity of forms, such poets are among the few in the history of Chinese literature and even the history of world literature.

Qu Yuan had his outstanding poetic talent. But above this, the basic reason why he was able to achieve great achievements should be pointed out again and again: it was his love for the people, his love for the motherland, his love for truth, his love for justice, and his ability to immerse himself in the deepest parts of life and nature. He was creating his poems with all his life, and therefore his life became an immortal and tragic epic. (Attached picture)

    伟大的爱国诗人——屈原
    郭沫若
    编者按：今年六月十五日（旧历五月五日）是我国伟大的爱国诗人和政治家——屈原逝世二千二百三十周年纪念日。屈原是我国战国时代的楚国贵族，但他始终反对楚国王朝的腐败政治，坚持自己正直的政治主张。他的诗篇“离骚”强烈地表现了他的爱国热情，是有高度人民性的不朽杰作。世界和平理事会号召全世界人民于今年九月间纪念四大文化名人，其中之一就是屈原。
    （一）
    屈原是中国民族所产生出的一位伟大的诗人。他热爱人民，热爱祖国，热爱真理和正义，他的诗是由这种真挚的感情所充溢着的。
    他以二二九二年前（纪元前三四○年）生于战国时代的楚国，照族系上讲来，是楚国王族的同宗。屈姓是春秋初年（纪元前七世纪）楚武王的儿子屈瑕的子孙。屈是屈瑕的封地。但屈原在“惜诵”里面说，他自己的出身是“贱贫”的。这是因为“楚邦之法，禄臣再世而收地”（韩非子：喻老篇），封君只传两代，便要由王家收回土地。故屈原尽管与楚王同宗，事实上只等于楚国的一个平民。
    因为这样的关系，他很知道民间的疾苦。看到人民生活的多灾多难，他经常叹息而至于流眼泪。后来在他失意遭受了流窜的时候，他屡次想跑到别国去，这是战国时代一般知识分子的常态，但他也想到人民的灾难而不忍离开。他似乎是特别同情农民的。在“卜居”里面曾说到屈原向郑詹尹问过：
    “宁诛锄草茅以力耕乎？将游大人以成名乎？”这样相反的问题，他列举了八对，上一项都是他所愿意做或已经做了，下一项都是他所不愿意做的。如果“卜居”的描写合乎事实，那么屈原就是愿意拿着锄头耕田，而不肯去游说诸侯以求一官半职。
    同情人民、热爱人民，这是屈原的基本精神。有了这种精神，所以他才能够博得人民的同情，他的诗也才能够有充沛的生命，在中国的文化史上卷起了一次诗歌革命的风暴，在文学发展上发生着深刻的长远的影响，使两千多年来的中国人民一直都在纪念着他。
    屈原的诗歌，根据汉代官家的著录，在当时只留下二十五篇。很可庆幸的是这二十五篇一直保留到现在，并没有残缺。那就是“九歌”十一篇，“九章”九篇，“离骚”、“天问”、“招魂”、“卜居”、“渔父”各一篇，一共二十五篇。虽然后汉的王逸把“招魂”作为宋玉的作品，而把可疑的“远游”一篇充足了二十五篇的数目，但我们根据司马迁的“屈原列传”和“招魂”本身的内证，可以断定“招魂”确实是屈原的作品，而“远游”则很有可能是司马相如“大人赋”的初稿。在这二十五篇中，还有一个近于公认的看法是：“卜居”和“渔父”（特别是“渔父”）也不会是屈原所作。但其中用韵还是先秦古韵，我认为当是屈原的后人如宋玉、唐勒、景差等，同情屈原而又深知屈原的生活和思想者的作品。故这两篇尽管不是屈原所作，而在作为研究屈原的资料上仍然是可以宝贵的。
    根据那些最可靠的作品，我们可以看出，屈原诗歌的特质就是人民气息的非常浓厚。首先值得注意的，他是采用着民间歌谣体，而充分地把规模扩大了。
    在屈原以前，中国古代贵族阶级的诗歌，如“大雅”、“小雅”、“商颂”、“鲁颂”等，以及春秋以来的青铜器上的一些有韵的铭文，不分南国和北国，都一致地采用着四言诗的格调，和民间口语是脱离了的。到了屈原，虽然在“天问”、“招魂”、“橘颂”的几篇中，基本上还保留着四言格调，而在其它的篇章中便把这种格调彻底打破了。
    方言和口语的大量使用，是屈原诗歌的一大特色。这些字眼是举不胜举的。一个反复使用的“兮”字便是最好的一把钥匙。“兮”字是古代民歌里所常见的字，采自民间的“国风”也常见使用。这个字，今音虽读如牺，古音却读如呵，懂得这个音窍去读屈原作品，民歌品质的真相便完全表露出来了。
    屈原在古代中国的诗歌中是创造了一个新的形式的，而这个新的形式和他的同情人民、热爱人民的感情意识正相为表里。故屈原的诗歌实现了内容与形式的典型的一致。
    （二）
    屈原不仅是一位热爱人民的诗人，同时也是一位有远大抱负的政治家。
    他生在楚国，因而热爱楚国。但他的对于祖国的热爱，是超过了楚国的范围的。
    请读他的“天问”吧。那里面所包含着的一百七十多个问题，大部分是关于整个中国历史的叙述，从虞夏殷周以来每一代的事迹都说得相当详细，而最后说到楚国时却只有四五句而已。再请读他的“离骚”吧。那里面也在称赞尧、舜、禹、汤、?陶、伊尹、武丁、傅说、周文王、齐桓公，而却没有一处说到楚国的先公先王。从这里，屈原的抱负不是很明显地可以看出吗？屈原，他不仅热爱楚国，而且热爱中国。
    中国的古代社会，在春秋以前虽然仿佛是一个统一的局面，但那局面很小，而在实质上只是一些大小氏族集团（所谓“万邦”）的并不十分紧密的联盟。那些氏族集团在联盟期中，特别在联盟瓦解之后，都各自为政，进行其独立性或半独立性的发展。但有一点是很重要的，便是语言文字和风俗习惯，在基本上是在统一形式之下发展着。因此，在这长期的个别发展中，中国的局面由小而大，到了春秋末年已经普遍地生出了更严密的统一要求，即所谓“大一统”。由殷周以来的多数氏族集团归并而为春秋的十二诸侯，再归并而为战国的七雄，这样的历史发展的轨迹正明显地表示着这个“大一统”的趋势。这是中国民族的一个总要求，差不多无例外地，反映在周秦之际的各家学派的主张里面。
    屈原当然体会到了这种趋势和要求，而生出了由楚国来统一中国的抱负：“忽奔走以先后兮，及前王之踵武”（离骚）——他要急走直追，辅助楚王，向统一中国的禹汤文武追赶上去。
    要由楚国来统一中国，楚国在当时是不是有这样的资格呢？这倒并不是屈原一个人的纯粹的主观愿望。
    楚国本来是殷王朝的同盟，殷代灭亡后，在周代的几百年间，独立地在南方发展。到了战国时代，长江流域、汉水流域、淮河流域的全部都入了楚国的版图。此外还包含着今天的陕西、河南、山东等省的各一部分。中国南部的开发，楚民族的“篳路蓝缕”是尽了很大的力量的。故在战国七雄中，楚国的疆土最大，而兵力也不弱。
    就在屈原诞生前四十一二年前，楚国的悼王曾经重用吴起，对于内政雷厉风行地施行了一次大改革。“明法审令，损不急之官，废公族疏远者，以抚养战斗之士，要在强兵，破驰说之言纵横者。于是南平百越，北并陈蔡，却三晋，西伐秦”。（史记吴起列传）这和二十年后秦孝公重用商鞅的作风是很相仿佛的，吴起与商鞅同是出身于魏国的法家，他们的主张和手腕相同，目标相同，步骤也是相同的。但不久楚悼王一死（纪元前三八一年），楚国的反动公族们便把吴起射杀了。吴起的悲剧也和商鞅的相同，所不同的只是商鞅执政的时期很长（在二十年以上）而吴起执政的时期很短（只有两年光景）。但在吴起死后，射杀吴起的反动派有七十多家被治罪而整个消灭了，由此可见吴起的余教在楚国必然还有留存。
    屈原正是在吴起商鞅等实行变法的流风遗韵中长大的。他靠着自己的才能曾经得到楚怀王的信任，做到仅次于令尹的左徒的官职，参预了高级的行政工作和外交工作。他的实际政治家的作风相当浓厚地表示着法家色彩。请读他的“惜往日”吧。他说：“惜往日之曾信兮，受命诏以昭时；奉先功以照下兮，明法度之嫌疑。”（回想从前我曾受信用，禀受王命使时代光明；把先代的业绩昭示众庶，使法度没有嫌疑可存），这明明就是“明法审令”的作法。在他所说的“先功”（先代的业绩）里面，可能就包含有吴起的余教。故在这之外，他在同一诗中，更主张“参验考实”，而反对“背法度而心治”。这些都是法家的基本主张。
    然而屈原所遭遇的楚怀王，却不能和吴起所遭遇的楚悼王、商鞅所遭遇的秦孝公相比，因而他倒遭遇到了和吴起商鞅一样的悲剧。楚怀王是一位虚荣心很重，浅薄无定见，而又妄自尊大的人，他很轻易地听信了反动贵族的中伤，便把屈原疏远了。这个国王被一群反动派包围，一味地骄奢淫逸，轻举妄动，多树敌人，容易受人欺骗，也容易受人挑衅，结果一败再败，就像一个败家子一样，把楚国几百年来所建立起的基业，差不多就败坏在他一个人手里。最后还被秦国诱引去做了三年俘虏，囚死在秦国。
    楚怀王的继承者顷襄王是更不济事的。在他的时代，正直的屈原更进一步遭受到迫害而被放逐。结果在顷襄王二十一年（纪元前二七八年）秦国的大将白起领兵南下，把郢都破灭了，焚烧残杀，剗平了历代楚王的陵墓，还长驱直入，占领了洞庭、五渚、江南。楚国的君臣朝东北逃走到陈城去才暂时稳定了下来，几几乎弄到了亡国的地步。
    国家败坏到这步田地，在热爱祖国的诗人屈原当然是最不甘心的。这便是在他后期诗歌里面所包含着的绞心沥血的悲痛、抑郁、愤懑和绝望底深在根源。在郢都破灭后，他在逃难中做过一首“哀郢”的诗来表示深沉的悲痛。他那时已经六十二岁了。他是往南方逃走的。他逃走的方向恰恰是白起进兵的方向。所以他逃到了那儿，白起也追到了那儿。这就逼得他就在郢都破灭的那一年，终于跳进湖南境内的汨罗江里自杀了。
    屈原的自杀，事实上是殉国难。很显然，他是把他自己造成了一个典型悲剧时代中的典型悲剧人物。
    （三）
    屈原的才智是向多方面发展的。
    他的感情真挚，想像力丰富，对于自然物也有同样极其深厚的爱。他爱橘树而加以赞颂，他爱各种各样的香草而尽力栽培，他爱南方的山川风物、而仿佛沉潜到它们的神髓里去了。他利用着民间的信仰，每每把山川风物人格化，而且化得非常优婉。巫山有女鬼，湘水有女神，太阳和云都有男性或女性的主宰者，而在神与人之间或神与神之间竟往往使他们发生着深挚的恋爱。
    自然现象，特别是天界的现象，被他人格化了之后，有时却都受着他的驱遣，为他服务，或者驾车，或者打仪仗，或者充任卫士。这样使他脱离尘寰而在天空中飞行——时而飞到天国的门前，时而攀上世界的屋顶，时而跑到西极的天边，去追求理想的乐土和“足与为美政”的理想的君王。他所理想的君王是用“美人”来象征的。但那样的乐土和“美人”，在天上和地下，他都不曾找到。
    他虽然承认着民间信仰，但他对于神鬼之类的超现实的存在却并没有丝毫的信仰。他对于超现实的世界是怀疑的，有时甚至是憎恨的。请读“天问”吧。那里有这样的话：“天命反侧，何佑何罚？齐桓九会，卒然身杀！”这是在替齐桓公鸣不平，也就等于说没有什么“天命”。“招魂”里面有天国的描写，但那天国的景象，就给地狱一样，并不是可以使灵魂安乐的地方。“离骚”里面，诗人飞到了天国的门前，叫门子开门，而门子倚着天门望望，不肯替他打开。这是表示天国也和地上的宫庭一样势利或者腐化。
    最值得注意的，是“天问”篇开头关于天体的一些疑问。他在问：天地未开辟以前的情况是怎样？天体是谁创造的？何以分成了十二等分？日月星辰何以不坠？太阳一天走多少里？晚间藏到什么地方去了？月亮何以有圆有缺？——问得非常现实。这可表明屈原并不是经常以诗人的幻想去对待自然现象，而有时是以科学家的态度进行真理的探索。
    关于天体的探问，在屈原时代是一个相当普遍的问题。庄子的“天运篇”一开头就这样问过：天是动的吗？地是静的吗？太阳和月亮是在那儿赛跑的吗？谁在主持？谁在牵线子？谁没有事做在玩把戏？
    还有一个故事出自庄子“天下篇”，是说南方有一位奇人名叫黄缭，他问“天地所以不坠不陷，风雨雷霆之故”。北方的一位学者，名家（战国时讲逻辑的一派）的领袖，曾经做过梁国（魏）宰相的惠施，“不辞而对，不思而答，遍为万物说”。
    这些都表示着与屈原同时代的学者们对于天体的运行和构造是有着普遍的关心。就在这一方面，屈原无疑也是受了时代潮流的影响。
    屈原所处的时代，在中国历史上，是一个文化灿烂的黄金时代。杰出的思想家、政治家、文章家、科学家（天文、历数等）一大批地涌出，真真是呈现出了百花齐放的壮观。屈原以他的才质和地位，很容易受到各家学说的影响，而使他向多方面发展。但毫无疑问，他在诗歌方面的贡献是特出一头地的。
    他的诗歌被保留了下来的虽然只有二十几篇，而内容却是无比的丰富。有平正、素朴的“橘颂”，有清新、玲珑的“九歌”，有瑰奇、艳丽的“招魂”，有雄浑、奇特的“天问”，有像雷电交加般的悲愤、沉郁而又奔放、宏壮的“离骚”和“九章”中的一大部分。感情的真挚，幻想的自由，词藻的馥郁，韵调的铿锵，形式的多样，像他这样的诗人在中国文学史上乃至世界文学史上，都是有数的。
    屈原是有他的卓越的诗才。但在这之上，使他能够有伟大成就的基本原因，应该不嫌重复地指出，是他的热爱人民、热爱祖国、热爱真理、热爱正义、而能够沉潜到生活与自然的最深处。他是在用他全部的生命来创造他的诗歌，因而他的一生也就成为了一首不朽的悲壮的史诗。（附图片）
