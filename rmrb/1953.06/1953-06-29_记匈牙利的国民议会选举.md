    A Record of the National Assembly Election in Hungary
    Che Yun
    Hungary held its National Assembly election on May 17th. This day was a day of celebration for the people of Hungary. In the capital, Budapest, and in every town and village, large and small, throughout Hungary, from the vast plains of the east to the rolling hills of the west, the atmosphere was filled with festive joy. People participated in the election with excitement, casting their votes to express their support for peace, democracy, and the cause of socialism, and to show their gratitude and love for the National Committee of the Hungarian People's Independent Front and Comrade Rákosi.
    The National Assembly election is a major event in the political life of the Hungarian people. This election fully demonstrates the great achievements Hungary has made in the political, economic, and cultural fields in the four years since the last election in 1949. Four years ago, the National Committee of the Hungarian People's Independent Front made such promises and guarantees to the Hungarian people: to invest 35 billion forints during the Five-Year Plan (1950-1954); to increase steel production to 1.5 million tons, coal production to 18 million tons, and electricity generation to 4.27 billion kilowatt-hours... In fact, by last year—the third year of the Five-Year Plan—the investment had already reached 40 billion forints, and the production of steel, coal, and electricity had all exceeded the above quotas. In the past four years, the improvement in the material and cultural living standards of the Hungarian people, as well as the vigorous development in science, culture, and art, has been enormous. As the Hungarian people say, "Even developed capitalist countries such as Britain, France, and the Netherlands have been left far behind."
    In the period leading up to the election, the Hungarian people launched a wave of enthusiasm for recommending candidates for the National Assembly deputies with particularly high political fervor. Factories, enterprises, mines, state-owned farms, agricultural machinery stations, production cooperatives, mass organizations, government agencies, schools, and troops all held meetings to discuss and put forward candidate lists. Comrade Rákosi, the outstanding leader of the Hungarian people, was unanimously nominated as the first candidate by the working people in various places. Many well-known political leaders, social activists, and ordinary people who have made outstanding contributions in labor have been nominated as candidates. To welcome the election festival, the broad masses of Hungarian working people launched a warm socialist production competition, striving to complete the production targets set by the state ahead of schedule. The production competition initiated by the workers of the "Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej" shipyard to welcome the election and defend peace received a widespread response. On the eve of the election, good news of the competition came from various places: the national industrial production plan for April was completed by 103 percent; the Petőfi coal mine completed 121.5 percent of its coal mining plan; the young lathe operator Balubus completed 575 percent of his production quota in April, 847 percent of the day's plan on May 11, and even increased to 976 percent the next day (May 12). In the countryside, tens of thousands of working farmers also completed their semi-annual delivery tasks ahead of schedule. Two thousand production cooperatives even delivered public grain to the state before the end of April.
    May 17 was a clear and bright spring day, and the Hungarian capital was dressed in festive attire. Election slogans and posters were hung all over the streets and squares, and colorful banners and the solemn and bright Hungarian and Soviet national flags fluttered everywhere. Huge portraits of the great Lenin, the immortal revolutionary teacher Stalin, and Comrade Rákosi, the beloved leader of the Hungarian people, were hung on the walls of many buildings and in every polling station. Early in the morning, long before the start of the voting, voters from all over, dressed in beautiful clothes, flocked to the polling stations in groups along the asphalt roads in the city, along the paths in the countryside, and along the rugged mountain roads, by tram, car, and horse-drawn carriage, joyfully. Young men and women who had just turned eighteen and twenty, who had just obtained the right to vote for the first time in accordance with the new election law, sang moving songs all the way to cast their first vote in their lives and formally exercise their rights as citizens.
    During the election, many song and dance troupes, bands, cultural groups, and amateur art troupes appeared in towns and villages, dressed in bright and colorful national costumes, playing musical instruments, singing songs, holding flowers, and dancing, enthusiastically celebrating their own festival.
    Not only workers in industrial areas, farmers in remote villages, university professors, and shop employees voted, but also sailors sailing overseas and patients in hospitals. For example, the sailors on the Hungarian sea vessels "Budapest" and "Tisza," sailing in the Mediterranean Sea, also exercised their civil rights in accordance with the election law. Half an hour after the start of the election, the ship's election committee telegraphed the country to report that all the ship's employees had unanimously voted for the candidates of the National Committee of the People's Independent Front thousands of miles away. In order to enable the elderly and infirm who were inconvenient to walk to vote, the election committee specially set up mobile ballot boxes. Polling places were also set up in hospitals and sanatoriums for patients and those undergoing recuperation. A young mother, Mrs. Goberch, who lived in the obstetrics ward of a hospital in Budapest, said after voting: "This is the first time I have voted. It is so touching that my daughter is growing up in such a praiseworthy era! As a mother, I vote for those who have created this bright future."
    On the day of the election, whether male or female, old or young, everyone voted for Comrade Rákosi. Because they knew that voting for their beloved leader was tantamount to voting for peace, freedom, and happiness. An 86-year-old man in Kalocsa said when voting: "I have ten sons, all of whom are members of cooperatives, and I also have sixteen grandchildren. I want them to live a happy life forever, so I will vote for Comrade Rákosi."
    Comrade Rákosi himself, like ordinary voters, also went to the polling station at 9 o'clock in the morning to cast his vote.
    On May 19, the national election results were announced: 98 percent of all voters, or 6,370,519 people, voted, and 98.2 percent of the votes, or 6,256,653 votes, belonged to the People's Front.
    This election vividly demonstrated the great unity of the Hungarian people under the banner of patriotism, and demonstrated their love for the Hungarian Working People's Party and Comrade Rákosi. This election is a major victory for socialist democracy, and also a serious blow to those imperialists who are bent on carrying out sabotage activities from within peaceful and democratic countries.
    The great Hungarian poet Petőfi once predicted more than a hundred years ago:
    "Oh, sacred freedom! How many glorious figures
    Have given up their lives to complete your cause!
    Victory is about to come, although it is not so now,
    However, the final battle promises us triumph."
    This prediction has now been fully realized in Hungary. The freedom and democracy that the Hungarian people have long yearned for and sacrificed their blood for and struggled hard for have been realized. Today, they are joyfully enjoying the fruits of their victory and will always resolutely defend this achievement.

    记匈牙利的国民议会选举
    车澐
    匈牙利在五月十七日举行了国民议会的选举。这一天是匈牙利全国人民欢庆的日子。在首都布达佩斯，在匈牙利全国各个大小城镇和乡村，从东部辽阔的平原到西部起伏的山地，到处都充满了欢乐的节日的气氛。人们怀着兴奋的心情参加了选举，投票表示对和平、民主和社会主义事业的拥护，对匈牙利人民独立阵线全国委员会和对拉科西同志的感激与热爱。
    国民议会的选举是匈牙利人民政治生活中的重大事件。这次选举，充分地表现出了匈牙利四年来（上次选举是在一九四九年举行的）在政治、经济和文化方面所获得的伟大成就。匈牙利人民独立阵线全国委员会在四年以前向匈牙利人民曾提出了这样的诺言和保证：在五年计划（一九五○—一九五四年）期间投资三百五十亿福林。把钢的产量提高到一百五十万吨，煤产量增加到一千八百万吨，发电量增加到四十二亿七千万瓩时……。而实际上，在去年——五年计划的第三年度，投资额就已达到了四百亿福林，钢、煤和电力的产量也都已超过了上述定额了。四年来，匈牙利人民的物质和文化生活水平的提高，以及在科学、文化和艺术方面的蓬勃发展，其速度和成就是十分巨大的，照匈牙利人民的说法，那就是：“像英国、法国与荷兰这些发达的资本主义国家也被远远地甩在后面了。”
    在迎接选举的期间，匈牙利人民以特别高涨的政治热情展开了推举国民议会议员候选人的热潮。全国各地的工厂企业、矿山、国营农场、农业机器站、生产合作社和群众团体、机关、学校与部队纷纷举行会议，讨论提出候选人名单。匈牙利人民的杰出领袖拉科西同志被各地劳动人民一致提为第一名候选人。许多著名的政治领袖、社会活动家和在劳动中有卓越贡献的普通人们，都被提名为候选人。为迎接选举的节日，匈牙利广大劳动人民展开了热烈的社会主义生产竞赛，争取提前完成国家所规定的生产目标。“乔治乌—德治”造船厂工人们所发起的迎接选举，保卫和平的生产竞赛，获得了普遍的响应。在选举的前夕，各地纷纷传来了竞赛的捷报：全国工业生产的四月份计划完成了百分之一百零三；彼多菲煤矿完成了采煤计划的百分之一百二十一点五；青年镟工柏鲁布斯四月份完成自己生产定额的百分之五百七十五，五月十一日完成一天计划的百分之八百四十七，第二天（五月十二日）更增到百分之九百七十六。在农村中成千成万的劳动农民也提前完成了上半年的缴纳任务。有二千个生产合作社甚至在四月底以前就已向国家缴纳了公粮。
    五月十七日是一个晴朗明媚的春天的日子，匈牙利首都在这一天披上了节日的盛装。各个街道上、广场上，都挂满了选举的标语和招贴画，五色缤纷的旗帜和庄严鲜明的匈牙利国旗和苏联国旗到处迎风飘扬。许多建筑物的墙上，每个选举站里都挂着伟大的列宁、不朽的革命导师斯大林和匈牙利人民敬爱的领袖拉科西同志的巨幅画像。一清早，在开始投票时间很久以前，穿着漂亮服装的各地选民就成群结队地沿着城里的柏油大道，沿着农村里的小径，沿着崎岖的山路，乘着电车，汽车，马车，欢天喜地的奔向各个投票站去了。依照新选举法第一次获得选举权的刚刚年满十八岁和二十来岁的青年男女们，更在一路上尽情地唱着动人的歌曲，去投他们生平第一次的选票，正式行使他们作为一个公民的权利了。
    在选举进行的时候，各地的城镇和乡村里出现了很多的歌舞队、乐队、文工团和业余艺术团体，他们穿着鲜艳夺目的民族服装，奏着乐器，唱着歌曲，拿着花，跳着舞，热情洋溢地庆祝着自己的节日。
    投票选举的不仅有工业区的工人，有僻远乡村里的农民，有大学的教授和商店的职员，而且还有远在海外航行的海员和住院的病人。例如，在地中海上航行着的匈牙利海船“布达佩斯号”和“第沙号”上的海员们，也按照选举法行使了自己的公民权利。船上的选举委员会在开始选举半小时以后，就用电报向国内报告：全船员工在数千英里之外一致投票选举了人民独立阵线全国委员会的候选人。为了使年老体弱不便行走的人们投票，选举委员会还特地设立了流动投票箱。在医院和疗养所中，也为病人和休养员们设立了投票处。住在布达佩斯医院产科病房里的一位年轻母亲戈伯希夫人，在投票后说：“我这是第一次投票。我的女儿生长在这样值得歌颂的时代，是多么令人感动呀！我以一个母亲的身份，投票选举那些创造了这种光明前途的人们。”
    在选举那一天，不论男女，也不论老年还是青年，都投了拉科西同志的票。因为他们知道，为自己亲爱的领袖而投票，也就是等于为和平、自由和幸福而投票。卡尔查格城的一位八十六岁的老人在投票时这样说：“我有十个儿子，他们都是合作社的社员，我还有十六个孙儿孙女。我愿意他们永远过幸福的生活，所以我要投拉科西同志一票。”
    拉科西同志本人和普通的选民一样，在早上九时也到投票站去投了自己的一票。
    五月十九日，全国的选举结果揭晓了：全体选民的百分之九十八，即六百三十七万零五百十九人都投了票，选票中的百分之九十八点二，即六百二十五万六千六百五十三张选票，是属于人民阵线的。
    这次选举，十分生动地显示了匈牙利全国人民在爱国主义旗帜下的伟大的团结，显示了他们对于匈牙利劳动人民党和拉科西同志的热爱。这次选举，是社会主义民主的一个重大胜利，也是对于那些一心想从和平民主国家内部来进行破坏活动的帝国主义的严重打击。
    匈牙利伟大诗人裴多菲在一百多年以前曾经这样预言过：
    “啊，神圣的自由！多少光荣人物
    曾经为了完成你的事业抛弃生命！
    胜利将要降临，纵然现在还不是那样，
    但是，最后的战斗把凯旋许给了我们。”
    这一预言，现在在匈牙利已经完全实现了。匈牙利人民长时期以来所渴望并为之流血牺牲，艰苦奋斗的自由、民主，已经实现了。他们今天正在欢乐地享受着自己的胜利的成果，并将永远坚决地保卫着这个成果。
