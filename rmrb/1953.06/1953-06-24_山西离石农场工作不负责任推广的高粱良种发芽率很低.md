    Shanxi Lishi Farm's Irresponsible Promotion of High-Yielding Sorghum Seeds Results in Low Germination Rate
    Liu Wenjun writes: The high-yielding sorghum seeds promoted by the Lishi County Farm in Shanxi Province have a very low germination rate, causing losses to farmers. The "Crooked Neck Sorghum" seeds purchased by the Wayao Slope Li Dong and two other agricultural producers' cooperatives in the seventh district of the county from the farm, when planted in fertile land, failed to sprout in one-third of the area. The same situation occurred when the Wangjiagou Wang Tingkui Agricultural Producers' Cooperative and the Tunligou He Chengsheng Agricultural Producers' Cooperative used the farm's sorghum seeds. Lishi Farm is irresponsible in promoting improved varieties, failing to conduct germination tests beforehand, leading to losses for farmers. This affects farmers' trust in the farm and creates difficulties for future promotion of improved varieties. The farm should earnestly correct this working style in its future work.

专栏：读者来信摘要

    山西离石农场工作不负责任推广的高粱良种发芽率很低
    刘文军来信：山西离石县农场推广的高粱良种发芽率很低，使农民受到了损失。该县七区瓦窑坡李冬等三个农业生产合作社向农场调买的“歪脖子高粱”籽，种在丰产地里，有三分之一没有出苗。王家沟王廷奎农业生产合作社、屯里沟贺成生农业生产合作社用农场的高粱籽，也发生了同样的情形。离石农场推广良种不负责任，事前不作发芽试验，以致使农民受到损失，并影响了农民对农场的信任，给今后推广良种工作造成困难。该场今后在工作中应该切实改正这种工作作风。
