    Northeast Administrative Committee Holds Administrative Meeting
    To Deploy Industrial Production and Capital Construction Work
    The Northeast Administrative Committee convened an administrative meeting on the morning of June 5th. The meeting studied the industrial production and capital construction situation in the Northeast region from January to April 1953, and the work for the future. Zhang Mingyuan, Vice Chairman of the Northeast Administrative Committee, gave important instructions at the meeting.
    Regarding industrial production, Vice Chairman Zhang Mingyuan pointed out: From January to April 1953, the total output value of state-owned and local state-owned factories and mines in the Northeast region basically completed the plan, and enterprise management improved compared to last year. However, many factories and mines did not complete or fully complete the plan, and the situation of uneven production still exists relatively commonly; the level of enterprise management is also unbalanced. Generally, mines lag behind factories, and local state-owned industries lag behind state-owned industries. Even within the same system, the gap between advanced and backward is very large.
    Based on the above situation, Vice Chairman Zhang Mingyuan pointed out that the focus and requirements of industrial production work in June and the third quarter, generally speaking, are: first, to ensure the comprehensive completion and over-completion of the national plan. According to the work arrangements of the central industrial ministries, the central requirement for enterprises this year should be to improve the level of enterprise management and ensure the comprehensive completion of the national plan. First, we should focus on doing a good job in planning management (light industry and local state-owned industries should focus on improving quality). On the basis of doing a good job in planning management, implement the responsibility system, and then do a good job in technical management and implement the technical responsibility system. In the first and second quarters, the general focus was on planning management, but the progress was not balanced enough. Many factories and mines only did some preparatory work, the work of mobilizing the masses was very poor, and the improvement of planning management was not significant. In order to do a good job in planning management, we should focus on doing a good job in operation plans. Second, strengthen the dispatching mechanism and do a good job in production dispatching; make the quotas accurate through planning management, which requires doing accurate grassroots records. To do these tasks well, in addition to emphasizing the need for leaders to conduct detailed investigations and research and make full preparations, it is also necessary to earnestly do ideological work in enterprises, especially ideological work for technicians and staff; oppose the phenomenon of no one being responsible, oppose departmentalism, and strengthen the concept of planning and improve labor discipline. After factories and mines have a foundation in planning management and the responsibility system, they can further focus on technical management and launch a campaign to improve product quality. At the same time, it is also necessary to strengthen leadership over mines and change the backward state of mines; pay attention to the trial production of new products in the machinery industry; strengthen the education of workers in observing labor discipline; and promote advanced Soviet experience in an organized and planned manner.
    Regarding capital construction work, Vice Chairman Zhang Mingyuan pointed out that units already under construction should continue to deepen the movement to establish a responsibility system to ensure quality, oppose waste, and achieve the overall requirements of completing tasks on time or ahead of schedule, and implementing "good, fast, economical, and safe." Those who have not thoroughly carried out the movement to establish a responsibility system should not end it hastily. To carry out this movement, it is necessary to extensively mobilize the masses in an organized and led manner, clarify the goals of the movement among cadres and the masses, combine exposing shortcomings with commending advanced models, adopt a method of everyone participating, raise questions, and propose solutions to solve problems and promote work. After the problems are identified, we must adopt a method of inspecting while building, and earnestly establish a necessary and feasible responsibility system. After laying the foundation for the movement to establish a responsibility system, the next step should be to focus on technical management, carry out a mass quality inspection to ensure project quality, strengthen labor discipline, and promote advanced experience and implement economic accounting through this central task. Second, we must seize the second phase of construction preparation work. All aspects of preparation work, such as design, materials, and processing orders, must be inspected. The provincial and municipal people's governments and relevant departments should actively and specifically help solve problems, such as whether materials are available, and necessary adjustments can be made to ensure that construction starts on time or ahead of schedule. In June, a check should be conducted on a number of key projects.
    Regarding the ideological understanding of capital construction cadres, Vice Chairman Zhang Mingyuan pointed out that the relationship between the two parties, A and B, in many projects is currently abnormal, and they shirk and complain to each other when things happen. This is mainly due to disregarding the overall situation, lacking an overall concept, and the existence of departmentalism and waiting-and-relying mentality. This thinking seriously affects the progress of the project and affects starting construction early and starting more construction, which must be continuously criticized and resolutely overcome.
    Finally, Vice Chairman Zhang Mingyuan pointed out that the leadership should mainly focus on key projects, and at the same time pay attention to strengthening leadership over design, geological exploration, and other departments. At present, we must first change the backward state of management in design work, establish planned management of design work, implement the responsibility system, promote the assembly line operation method, establish a contact system for design work, adjust design strength, and improve design work efficiency to overcome the current situation where design work lags behind construction. The leadership of various competent departments over geological exploration work is even weaker, and they must strengthen their leadership and assistance in the future to ensure the smooth progress of capital construction work.

    东北行政委员会召开行政会议
    布置工业生产和基本建设工作
    东北行政委员会于六月五日上午召开行政会议。会议研究了东北区一九五三年一月份至四月份的工业生产与基本建设的情况和今后的工作。东北行政委员会副主席张明远在会上作了重要指示。
    关于工业生产工作，张明远副主席指出：一九五三年一月份至四月份东北区国营与地方国营厂矿的生产总值，基本上完成了计划，企业管理工作比去年也有所改进。但不少厂矿未完成或未能全面地完成计划，生产不均衡的情况仍较普遍地存在；企业管理水平也不平衡，一般的情况是矿山落后于工厂，地方国营工业落后于国营工业，就是同一系统中，先进与落后的悬殊也很大。
    根据上述情况，张明远副主席指出：六月份与第三季度的工业生产工作的重点与要求，总的说来是：首先要保证全面地完成和超额完成国家计划。根据中央各工业部的工作部署，今年对企业的中心要求应是提高企业管理水平，保证全面完成国家计划，首先应以搞好计划管理为中心（轻工业与地方国营工业以提高质量为重点），在搞好计划管理的基础上贯彻责任制度，进而做好技术管理与贯彻技术责任制。第一、二季度一般的都是以计划管理工作为中心，但进行得不够平衡，许多厂矿还只是做了一些准备工作，发动群众的工作很差，计划管理的改进还不显著。为了搞好计划管理工作，应着重搞好作业计划。其次是加强调度机构，做好生产调度工作；通过计划管理将定额搞准确，这就需要做好准确的基层记录。要做好这些工作，除了必须强调领导上细致地调查研究和充分准备外，还必须认真做好企业中的思想工作，特别是做好技术人员和职员的思想工作；反对无人负责现象，反对本位主义思想，并加强计划观念与改善劳动纪律。各厂矿在计划管理和责任制有了基础之后，可以进一步以技术管理为中心，开展改善产品质量的运动。同时还要加强对矿山的领导，改变矿山的落后状态；重视机械工业的新产品试制工作；加强工人遵守劳动纪律的教育；有组织有计划地推广苏联先进经验。
    关于基本建设工作，张明远副主席指出，已经施工的单位，要继续深入展开建立责任制运动，以保证质量，反对浪费，达到按期或提前完成任务，贯彻“好、快、省、安全”的全面要求。建立责任制运动搞得不彻底的，不要草率结束。开展这一运动，必须是有组织有领导地广泛地发动群众，在干部与群众中明确运动的目标，把揭发缺点与表扬先进典型结合起来，采取大家动手的办法，提出问题，又提出办法，从而解决问题，推进工作。在问题摸清之后，要采取边检查边建设的办法，切实建立必要可行的责任制度。建立责任制运动打下基础后，下一步则应以技术管理为中心，开展群众性的质量大检查，保证工程质量，加强劳动纪律，并通过这一中心工作，来推广先进经验和贯彻经济核算制。其次，要抓紧第二期的施工准备工作，有关设计、材料、加工定货等各方面的准备工作，均要检查，省市人民政府及有关部门应积极地具体帮助解决问题，如材料的有无，可进行必要的调剂等，以保证如期或提早开工。六月份应选择若干重点工程进行一次检查。
    关于基本建设干部的思想认识问题，张明远副主席指出，目前许多工程的甲、乙双方关系不正常，遇事互相推诿，互相埋怨。这主要是由于不顾大局，缺乏整体观念，存在着本位主义思想和等待依赖思想。这种思想严重地影响了工程的进展，影响了早开工多开工，必须继续批判，切实予以克服。
    最后张明远副主席指出：领导力量主要放在重点工程，同时要注意加强对设计、地质钻探等部门的领导。目前首先应改变设计工作中管理的落后状况，要建立设计工作的计划管理，贯彻责任制，推广流水作业法，建立设计工作的联系制度，调整设计力量，提高设计工作效率，以克服设计工作落后于施工的现状。各主管部门对地质钻探工作的领导更弱，今后必须加强对他们的领导和帮助，以保证基本建设工作的顺利进行。
