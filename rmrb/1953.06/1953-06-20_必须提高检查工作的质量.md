    The Quality of Inspection Work Must Be Improved

    Comrade Mao Zedong, at the First Session of the Fourth National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, called on us to "overcome bureaucracy and maintain close ties with the people. Leading cadres at all levels, both central and local, should regularly go deep into the grassroots to inspect work." In accordance with Comrade Mao Zedong's instruction, many departments at the central level have successively had leading comrades personally take the lead or organize key cadres to go down to inspect work, and leading cadres of Party and government at all levels in the localities have also adopted a rotational approach to go deep into the grassroots. This is a very good phenomenon.

    When leading organs send people down to inspect work, if it is well-organized, it will certainly play a significant role in the struggle against bureaucracy. Comrade Stalin said, "The correct organization of checking on execution is of decisive significance in the struggle against bureaucracy and against formalism." He also said: "It can be stated with certainty that nine-tenths of our shortcomings and defects are due to the lack of correctly organized checking on execution. There is no doubt that if there were such correctly organized checking on execution, then shortcomings and defects would definitely be prevented in advance." (Report on the Work of the Central Committee of the CPSU(B) at the Seventeenth Party Congress) This is indeed the case. Some Party organizations, by inspecting the situation of agricultural production, have discovered serious phenomena in many places where the leadership of agricultural production neglects the characteristics of the small-peasant economy, seeks quick success and instant benefits, and therefore wastes effort to no avail, and even turns good things into bad things. Some Party organizations, in inspecting district and township work, have discovered the "five excessive" phenomena in rural areas: excessive meetings and training sessions, excessive official documents, reports and forms, excessive organizations, and excessive concurrent posts held by activists. They have discovered that our Party and government organizations have seriously alienated themselves from the peasant masses and their activists in rural work. Such inspections, due to correct leadership, have not only helped the work of the province but also greatly advanced the nationwide struggle against bureaucracy.

    However, there is also another situation at present. That is, some units do not pay enough attention to inspection work, the quality of the personnel sent to inspect work is not strong, there is a lack of unified leadership, a lack of correct work attitude and work methods, the sending organs do not educate the inspection personnel beforehand, do not assign tasks, and do not listen to their reports or solve the problems they raise after the inspection personnel return, so that it only increases a lot of trouble for the inspected areas or units. Some places have listed inspection groups as "one excessive" in addition to the "five excessive"—"excessive inspection groups"; some places do not call them work groups for inspecting bureaucracy, but "bureaucratic inspection groups." Inspection work is an effective weapon for overcoming bureaucracy, but not every kind of inspection work can become a weapon for overcoming bureaucracy. Poorly organized inspection groups, and inspection groups without correct standpoints, viewpoints, and methods, are useless to the higher levels and harmful to the lower levels. This situation must be corrected quickly.

    How can we enable inspection groups to give full play to their role and improve the quality of inspection work? From the work experience of many inspection groups that have already achieved success, to do this work well, we must have a correct understanding of inspection work, and the personnel of inspection work must have correct standpoints, viewpoints, and methods. First of all, the leading organs should regard inspection work as a top priority, and the leading cadres should take this weapon into their hands and regularly use this weapon to reduce shortcomings in their work. What should be particularly pointed out here is that the main purpose of the inspection work we are currently carrying out is to overcome bureaucracy in our many leading departments. Therefore, the task of this inspection work should not be casually assigned to anyone, and as Comrade Stalin said in the report to the Seventeenth Congress of the CPSU(B), the person in charge of inspection work should be designated as "not a secondary person, but a person with full prestige, that is, the leader of the organization himself."

    All leading cadres and personnel participating in inspection work must recognize that the purpose of inspection work is to deeply understand the situation, correct mistakes, and improve work. Therefore, we must never use methods that are divorced from reality and the masses to carry out inspection work. Inspection must have clear and specific goals, and we must oppose formalism that treats inspection work as a visit, sightseeing, and inspection for the sake of inspection. The goals of inspection should not be too many either; it is impossible to solve all the problems in one work. We should seek truth from facts, grasp one or two problems that are urgently needed to be solved and can be solved, study them in depth, and solve them. For the work below, on the one hand, we must discover shortcomings and put forward ways to overcome them, and at the same time, we must pay attention to discovering the achievements of the work below, comprehensively help them summarize experience, carry forward achievements, and correct mistakes. This is the correct attitude of inspection personnel. For the shortcomings that are found through inspection, we should carefully analyze them, clarify the subjective and objective reasons for these shortcomings, distinguish the responsibilities that the higher-level leading organs should bear and the responsibilities that the lower-level organs should bear in execution, and pay special attention to discovering from the inspection any unrealistic or imperfect aspects of the instructions and policies of the higher-level leading organs, so as to prescribe the right medicine and improve the work from top to bottom. In order to achieve this goal, the inspection personnel must follow what Comrade Mao Zedong said in the "Preface and Postscript to 'Rural Survey'": "First, look downwards, do not just look up to the sky," do not "look around and listen to rumors," and have "an interest and determination to look downwards." We must always keep in mind Comrade Mao Zedong's warning: "Those who look at problems subjectively, one-sidedly and superficially go to a place, do not ask about the situation of the environment, do not look at the whole of things (the history and the whole present situation of things), and do not touch the essence of things (the nature of things and the internal connection of this thing with other things), and then presumptuously issue orders, such people will not fall." (On Practice)

    In order to do a good job in inspection work, in the future, the cadres sent down by various departments to inspect work should be responsible to the higher-level leading organs on the one hand, and should be guided by the leading organs of the Party committee, government, or people's organizations at the higher level of the inspected areas or units on the other hand. Under normal circumstances, the cadres who go down to inspect work should conduct inspections through rather than over the leading organs of the inspected areas or units, and it is best to work with the people sent down by the local leading organs to gather, verify, and sort out the materials obtained from the inspection in the local area, and actively report their work opinions and conclusions to the higher-level leading organs of the inspected units and obtain their consent. Those who do not pay attention to "combining" with local cadres, insist on "going it alone," and do not jointly study solutions after inspection should be avoided. Of course, the lower-level leading organs should adopt a welcoming attitude towards the inspection groups sent by the higher levels, and give them practical help according to the purpose of the inspection group and in combination with the specific local situation. If the plan of the inspection group has unrealistic aspects, the local leading organs have the right to raise opinions. If there are differences between the opinions of the inspection group and their own opinions, they can report the divergent opinions to the higher level at the same time.

    Inspection work is a task of unity between the upper and lower levels. We must earnestly do this work well so as to more effectively overcome the bureaucratic work style of the leading organs, discover and effectively correct various shortcomings and errors at any time, and complete the glorious task of our national construction.

### 必须提高检查工作的质量

    必须提高检查工作的质量
    毛泽东同志在中国人民政治协商会议第一届第四次会议上号召我们“必须克服官僚主义，密切联系人民群众。中央和地方各级领导干部都应该经常地深入下层，检查工作”。按照毛泽东同志的这个指示，中央一级很多部门已先后由领导同志亲自带头或组织了主要干部下去检查工作，地方的各级党、政领导干部也采取轮流办法深入下层。这是很好的现象。
    领导机关派人下去检查工作，凡是组织得好的，一定可以对反对官僚主义的斗争发生很大的作用。斯大林同志说过：“正确组织审查执行情形的工作，在反对官僚主义和反对形式主义的斗争中具有决定意义。”又说：“可以肯定说，我们的缺点与缺陷，十分之九都是由于缺乏组织得正确的审查执行情形的工作。毫无疑义，如果有这种组织得正确的审查执行情形的工作，那末缺点和缺陷是一定会事先防止了的。”（在十七次党代表大会上关于联共（布）中央工作的总结报告）事实正是如此。有些党组织由于检查农业生产的情况，发现了许多地方在领导农业生产上有忽视小农经济的特点，贪多冒进，因而费力不讨好，甚至把好事办成坏事的严重现象。有些党组织在检查区乡工作中发现了农村中会议集训多，公文报告表册多，组织多，积极分子兼职多等“五多”现象，发现了我们党政组织在农村工作中有严重脱离农民群众及其积极分子的现象。这样的检查由于有正确的领导，就不但帮助了本省的工作，而且把全国的反官僚主义斗争大大地向前推进了。
    但在目前也还有另外一种情形。这就是有些单位对检查工作没有足够的重视，派出检查工作的人员质量不强，缺乏统一领导，缺乏正确的工作态度和工作方法，派出的机关对检查人员事前不进行教育，不交代任务，检查人员回来以后也不听取他们的报告，也不解决他们所提出的问题，以致徒然给被检查的地区或单位增加了很多麻烦。有的地方已把检查组列为“五多”之外的“一多”——“检查组多”；有的地方把他们不叫做检查官僚主义的工作组，而叫做“官僚主义的检查组”。检查工作是克服官僚主义的有效武器，但并不是任何一种检查工作都可以成为克服官僚主义的武器。组织得不好的检查组，和没有正确立场、观点、方法的检查组，对上无益，对下有害。这种情形必须迅速纠正。
    怎样才能使检查组充分发挥作用，提高检查工作的质量呢？从许多已经取得成绩的检查组的工作经验来看，要做好这一工作，必须对检查工作有正确的了解，检查工作的人员必须有正确的立场、观点和方法。首先，领导机关应当把检查工作看作是头等重要的事情，领导干部应当把这个武器抓到手里，经常利用这个武器使自己的工作减少缺点。在这里应当特别指出的是我们现在所进行的检查工作，其主要目的之一是在于克服我们的许多领导部门中的官僚主义。因此，这个检查工作的任务，就不应该随便交给任何一个人去执行，应当如斯大林同志在联共十七次代表大会上的报告所说的，指定主持检查工作的人，“不是次要的人，而是拥有充分威信的人，即该组织底领导者自己。”
    所有的领导干部和参加检查工作的人员都必须认清检查工作的目的，是在于深入了解情况，纠正错误，改进工作。因此决不能用脱离实际、脱离群众的办法去进行检查工作。检查必须有明确的具体的目标，反对把检查工作当作参观、游览，以及为检查而检查的形式主义。检查的目标也不可太多，企图在一次工作中解决所有的问题，是不可能的。应当实事求是地抓住当前急需解决而又能够解决的一两个问题，深入研究，加以解决。对于下面的工作，一方面要发现缺点，提出克服的办法，同时还必须注意发现下面的工作成绩，全面地帮助他们总结经验，发扬成绩，纠正错误。这才是检查工作人员的正确态度。对于检查出来的缺点，应仔细加以分析，弄清产生这些缺点的主客观原因，分清上级领导机关应负的责任和下级机关执行中应负的责任，特别应注意从检查中发现上级领导机关的指示、方针，有那些不切实际或不够完善的地方，以便对症下药，由上而下地改善工作。为要达到这种目的，检查工作的人员必须按照毛泽东同志在“‘农村调查’的序言和跋”中所说的，“第一是眼睛向下，不要只是昂首看天”，不要“东张西望，道听途说”，要有“眼睛向下的兴趣和决心”。我们要随时记牢毛泽东同志的警戒：“那些主观地、片面地和表面地看问题的人，跑到一个地方，不问环境的情况，不看事情的全体（事情的历史和全部现状），也不触到事情的本质（事情的性质及此一事情和其他事情的内部联系），就自以为是地发号施令起来，这样的人是没有不跌交子的。”（实践论）
    为了做好检查工作，今后各部门派下去检查工作的干部，一方面要向上面领导机关负责，同时应受被检查地区或单位的上一级党委、政府或人民团体的领导机关的指导。在一般情况下，下去检查工作的干部应当通过而不是超过被检查地区或单位的领导机关去进行检查，并且最好和地方领导机关派下去的人共同工作，把检查所得的材料，在当地加以汇集、核对和整理，把自己工作的意见和结论，主动地向被检查单位的上级领导机关做报告，并取得其同意。那些不注意和当地干部“结合”，一味“单干”，以及检查后也不和他们共同研究解决的办法，都应当避免。当然，下面的领导机关，对上面派去的检查组，应当采取欢迎的态度，根据检查组的目的，结合当地具体情况，给他们以切实的帮助。如果检查组的计划有不切合实际的地方，地方领导机关，有权提出意见。如果检查组的意见和自己的意见有分歧时，可将分歧意见同时报告上级。
    检查工作是上下一致的任务，我们必须认真做好这个工作，以便更有效地克服领导机关的官僚主义作风，随时发现并切实纠正各种缺点和错误，去完成我们国家建设的光荣任务。
