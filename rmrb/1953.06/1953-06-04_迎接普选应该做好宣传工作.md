    Propaganda Work Should Be Done Well to Welcome Universal Suffrage
    A letter from Yu Binchang, a reader from Yi County, Anhui Province: Implementing the system of People's Congresses elected by the people through universal suffrage throughout the country, and carrying out national population census and voter registration, is an unprecedented great event in the history of our country. This shows that the construction of our country's New Democratic regime is about to enter a more consolidated and complete stage, and the people's democratic life will be more fully guaranteed. I believe that these great achievements of the motherland should be publicized to the masses through various means. Literary and artistic workers should write and create more scripts, songs, and cartoons; local propaganda departments should conduct extensive publicity activities through newspapers, broadcasts, reports, symposiums, etc. In short, the people of the whole country should know that the ability to implement universal suffrage and convene the People's Congress today is the result of the blood of countless revolutionary martyrs and the long-term arduous struggle of the people of the whole country, and that they should cherish and exercise their solemn and glorious right to vote. Local propaganda departments have gained rich experience in propaganda and mobilization work in the past large-scale mass movements, and today they must use this experience to do a good job in propaganda work for the implementation of universal suffrage. We know that only by making propaganda and mobilization work known to every household and deeply rooted in the hearts of the people can this epoch-making political task be successfully completed.

专栏：读者来信摘要

    迎接普选应该做好宣传工作
    安徽省黟县读者余斌昌来信：在全国范围内实行由人民用普选方法产生的人民代表大会的制度，并且举行全国人口调查登记和选民登记工作，这是我国历史上空前未有的大喜事。这说明我国新民主主义的政权建设即将进入一个更加巩固和更加完备的阶段，人民的民主生活将得到更充分的保障。我认为，对于祖国这些伟大的成就，应当通过各种方式向人民群众进行宣传。文学艺术工作者应多多编写和创作各种剧本、歌曲、漫画；各地宣传部门应通过报刊、广播、报告会、座谈会等，进行广泛的宣传活动……。总之，应该使全国人民都知道今天能够实行普选，召开人民代表大会，是无数革命先烈的鲜血和全国人民长期艰苦斗争换来的，并且能够珍惜和运用自己的庄严和光荣的选举权利。各地宣传部门在过去一些大的群众运动中，已经取得了丰富的宣传鼓动工作经验，今天必须把这些经验用来为实行普选做好宣传工作。我们知道，只有把宣传鼓动工作做到家喻户晓，深入人心，才能使这个划时代的政治任务胜利完成。
