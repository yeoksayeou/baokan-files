    Yan Baihua's Experience as a State-Owned Store Manager
    By Our Reporter Shen Wenying

    In August 1950, Yan Baihua left the army to become the manager of the Shaoyang Prefectural Department Store in Hunan Province. She was unfamiliar with commercial work, but she was not intimidated by the difficulties. At that time, she thought: I am a Communist Party member, and Communist Party members have always advanced by overcoming difficulties. State-owned commerce is a department that manages money and goods, and these tasks mainly rely on employees. As long as I closely rely on all employees and improve their ideological awareness, I can do a good job. Therefore, from the beginning, she decided to first understand the ideological situation of the cadres. She talked with cadres every day for more than ten days. She found that the main ideological problem of the employees at that time was the underestimation of commercial work. Young students who had just joined the revolution said: We came to do revolution, but we are asked to be merchants. A group of cadres who went south felt: I have participated in the revolution for many years, and now that the country is liberated, I am asked to be a businessman. Due to the "anti-commercial" ideology, some comrades often considered their personal future and did not concentrate on their work, thus often causing mistakes in money handling. At that time, the amount of money involved was large, and the accounts were chaotic. Everyone urgently demanded that the problem of incorrect payments be resolved first.

    What method should be used to solve the problem of incorrect payments? She learned from the masses that a salesperson had never made a mistake in payment, so she decided to have him introduce his experience to everyone. He said: When there is no business, I practice abacus in addition to memorizing commodity prices. If the prices are memorized, I won't panic when customers come. When selling goods during the day, I reconcile the accounts after selling a few items. In the evening, I summarize each small summary. It's fast and correct, and no matter how busy I am, I won't make mistakes. But the main thing is to be careful and responsible. After listening to this, everyone conducted self-criticism in connection with their own situations, and felt that the main reason for the incorrect payments was a lack of responsibility for state property and a lack of concentration at work. People from student backgrounds emphasized that they couldn't use the abacus and thought that incorrect payments could be reported for reimbursement anyway. After half a month of repeated discussions and studies, everyone decided that the reasons for incorrect payments must be investigated in the future to strengthen the sense of responsibility. In this way, the phenomenon of incorrect payments gradually decreased.

    At that time, she thought: Although the problem of incorrect payments has been solved, we must fundamentally solve the problem of underestimating commercial work. But at that time, she didn't know what to say to convince comrades with this kind of thinking. So she went to read relevant documents. She repeatedly and carefully studied the status and role of the five economic components of the New Democracy. After understanding it herself, she used lectures and group discussions to make everyone realize that the state-owned economy is the leading economy, and state-owned stores are people's stores. Their task is to stabilize prices and ensure supply, which is a part of revolutionary work, and therefore a glorious job.

    It happened that in November of that year, due to transportation problems in the Shaoyang area, the department store ran out of cotton yarn. Within two days, private merchants took the opportunity to raise prices, raising the price of each bundle of yarn from 220,000 yuan to more than 260,000 yuan. The prices of rice and salt also rose, and the market prices became chaotic. After the Shaoyang Department Store transferred in cotton yarn, it sold it in large quantities, and the market prices stabilized. Yan Baihua seized this specific example and led all employees to condemn the disasters caused to the working people by price fluctuations during the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, in order to understand the huge role of the state-owned economy in leading the market. This was a vivid lesson for all employees, which made everyone begin to realize the importance of state-owned commerce.

    After criticizing the idea of underestimating commercial work, there were still difficulties in the work. In 1951, the annual department store sales target for the Shaoyang area was more than 20 billion yuan. The sales figures for the first and second quarters were very small. Starting in the third quarter, the former Central Ministry of Trade called on the national commercial system to launch a patriotic labor competition to complete the annual sales target. At that time, many comrades lacked confidence. Yan Baihua talked to salespeople and department staff. She found that the main reason for not completing the task in the past was that the sales figures were "secret," and the sales plan was not made public to the employees, so the employees did not know the goal of their struggle. At that time, she thought: This is like an army fighting a war. If the soldiers don't know the purpose and significance of the war, and don't understand the enemy's situation, they will definitely not be able to fight a good battle. Today, the salespeople in state-owned commercial departments are the frontline soldiers on the economic front, so the plan must be given to the salespeople for discussion and execution in order to complete the task. Therefore, she convened the salespeople from the wholesale and retail departments to discuss who the state-owned commercial department's plan relies on to achieve, in order to enhance the salespeople's sense of responsibility. Subsequently, she organized the study of "Who Does Trade Work Serve," and criticized the erroneous ideas that doing business has little to do with the country and that state-owned commercial departments cannot carry out competitions, so that everyone established the view that state-owned trade must serve production and consumers, and realized the position and role of salespeople. Finally, the plan was made public to everyone, and each group and individual set sales plans, and reported publicly and discussed them in each department, and wrote guarantees. In this way, the sales task was successfully deployed.

    After the movement started, the sales business was still not developing quickly, and everyone felt that there were few methods. Yan Baihua carefully studied and analyzed the market situation at that time: Hunan Province had a bumper harvest of agricultural products, the cadres of state-owned enterprises were changed to a salary system, and the cadres of organs were changed from a supply system to a contract system. The exchange of materials between urban and rural areas was needed, and it was clear that there were conditions for selling daily necessities and industrial products. She also considered that state-owned commerce should not only supply cities, but also face the countryside. At that time, many employees in the company said that the department store's goods were not easy to sell in the countryside and could not find a market. In order to break this ideological obstacle, she sent a group to go deep into the market towns to understand the needs of farmers, and then let them come up with their own sales plans, take the goods and price lists, and distribute the price lists to cooperatives and rural vendors to organize them to sell. In just one and a half months, three people sold 320 million yuan. This sales method of facing the countryside and paying attention to policies was widely promoted throughout the province, which greatly promoted the sales business in the province. The Shaoyang Prefectural Department Store successfully completed the annual sales task.

    Three years of trade work experience told her that only by improving the ideological awareness of the masses and relying on the masses can the work be done well. The Shaoyang Prefectural Department Store improved its business on this basis. In 1951, it won the title of "Advanced Company" in the province, and in 1952, it won the "Superior Red Flag" of the Shaoyang Prefectural Professional Company. Because she was able to fully mobilize the masses, rely on the masses, and pay attention to ideological leadership in various movements, the company produced many advanced workers and activists, and developed six party members and more than 30 members of the Communist Youth League. Many young students changed from underestimating commercial work to striving to engage in commercial work. In addition, she seized the slack sales season every year, and with the help of the local party committee, absorbed a large number of students and held short-term training courses to train more than 300 cadres, who were equipped as cadres for two department store branch companies and three stores.

    She told reporters: Since the implementation of the economic accounting system, many managers have said that it is not easy to be a manager; I myself have not studied the economic accounting system enough. Now I have been transferred to the position of manager of the Changsha Procurement and Supply Station, and this job is very heavy; but I believe that under the leadership of the Party, as long as I continue to work hard and keep in mind the principle that socialist enterprises must rely on the enthusiasm of the masses, and strive to learn advanced experience and socialist management methods, I will be able to do the job well.

    阎柏华怎样做国营商店经理
    本报记者　沈文英
    一九五○年八月间，阎柏华离开部队到湖南省邵阳专区百货公司当经理。商业工作对她是很生疏的，但她并没有被困难吓倒。那时她想：我是一个共产党员，共产党员从来就是在克服困难中不断前进的。国营商业是个管钱管货的部门，这些工作主要是依靠职工来做。只要我紧紧地依靠全体职工，提高职工的思想觉悟，就能把工作搞好。因此她一开始就决定先摸一下干部的思想情况。她天天找干部谈心，一连谈了十多天。她发现当时职工思想上的主要问题是轻视商业工作。新参加革命的青年学生说：我们是来干革命的，却叫我们当商人。有一批南下的干部觉得：我参加革命多年了，现在全国解放了，反叫我当起买卖人来了。由于“轻商”思想作祟，有些同志经常考虑到个人前途，不专心工作，因而经常发生错款的事情。当时错款的数字很大，账目很混乱。大家都迫切地要求先解决错款问题。
    用什么办法来解决错款问题呢？她从群众中了解到有一个营业员从没错过款，于是就决定由他向大家介绍经验。他说：没生意时我除了练习打算盘，就记商品价格，价钱记熟了，来了顾客心不慌；白天卖货时，卖上几笔就合一下账，到晚上把每次小结总起来，又快又正确，再忙也不会错；但主要的还是要心细、负责。大家听了这段话，都联系自己进行了自我批评，觉得错款的主要原因是对国家财富不负责任，工作时精神不集中；学生出身的人强调不会打算盘，认为反正错款可向上报销。经过半个月的反复讨论研究，大家决定以后错款一定要追查原因，以加强责任心。这样一来，错款现象就逐渐减少了。
    那时她想到：错款问题虽然解决了，但是还得从根本上来解决轻视商业工作的问题。可是当时她不知道用什么道理来说服有这种思想的同志。她便去翻阅有关文件。她反复地仔细地研究了新民主主义五种经济的地位和作用。在自己搞通以后，她便采用讲课和小组讨论的方式，使大家认识到国营经济是领导经济，国营商店是人民的商店，它的任务是为了平稳物价，保障供应，是革命工作的一部分，因而是光荣的工作。
    正巧在那年十一月间，邵阳地区因运输上发生故障，百货公司棉纱脱销。在两天内，私商就乘机抬高价格，每捆纱由二十二万元抬高到二十六万元以上；大米、食盐价格也跟随上升，市场物价发生混乱。邵阳百货公司在调来棉纱后，大量抛售，市场物价平稳了下来。阎柏华就抓住这一具体事例，领导全体职工，控诉国民党反动派统治时期物价波动给劳动人民造成的祸害，来认识国营经济领导市场的巨大作用。这对全体职工是一课生动的教育，使大家开始认识到国营商业的重要性。
    在批判了轻视商业工作思想以后，工作上仍有困难。一九五一年，邵阳专区全年百货推销任务是二百多亿元，一、二季度推销的数字很小，第三季度开始，前中央贸易部号召全国商业系统展开爱国主义劳动竞赛来完成全年推销任务。当时很多同志信心不足。阎柏华就找营业员、科里工作人员谈话。她发现过去没有完成任务的主要原因是强调销售数字“保密”，没有把推销计划向职工公开，职工不知道奋斗的目标。当时她这样想：这好像军队打仗，如果战士们不知道打仗的目的和意义，又不了解敌情，就一定不能打漂亮仗。今天国营商业部门的营业员就是经济战线上的前哨战士，因此必须把计划交给营业员，让他们讨论执行，才能完成任务。于是她就召集批发、门市部的营业员讨论国营商业部门的计划依靠谁来实现，以增强营业员的责任心。随后又组织学习“贸易工作为谁服务”，批判了认为做生意和国家没有多大关系、国营商业部门不能开展竞赛等错误思想，使大家树立了国营贸易必须为生产和消费者服务的观点，认识了营业员的地位和作用。最后把计划向大家公开了，各小组和个人都订了推销计划，并在各部门内自报公议，写保证书。这样，推销任务就顺利地布置下去了。
    运动开展后，推销业务开展得仍旧不快，大家感到办法少。阎柏华仔细研究分析了当时的市场情况：湖南全省农产丰收，国家企业干部改为薪金制，机关干部由供给制改为包干制，城乡物资需要交流，推销日用百货、工业品显然是有条件的。她还考虑到国营商业不能仅仅供应城市，应该面向农村。当时公司里有好多职工都说百货公司的商品农村不好销，找不到市场。为了打破这一思想障碍，她派了一个小组深入集镇了解农民需要，然后由他们自己提出销货计划，带着商品和物价单，把物价单发给合作社和农村商贩，组织他们推销。在短短的一个半月内，三个人推销了三亿二千万元。这一面向农村、注意政策的推销方法，在全省普遍推广，对全省推销业务起了很大的推动作用。邵阳专区百货公司顺利地完成了全年的推销任务。
    三年来贸易工作的经验告诉她：只有提高群众的思想觉悟，依靠群众，才能做好工作。邵阳专区百货公司就是在这一基础上提高了业务，一九五一年在全省获得了“先进公司”的称号，一九五二年获得邵阳专区专业公司的优胜红旗。由于她在各项运动中能充分发动群众，依靠群众，注意思想领导，该公司涌现了不少先进工作者和积极分子，发展了六个党员和三十多个青年团员。很多青年学生由轻视商业工作转变为努力从事商业工作。另外，她每年抓紧淡销季节，在当地党委的帮助下，吸收大量学员，举办短期训练班，培养了三百多个干部，配备了两个百货支公司和三个商店的干部。
    她向记者表示：在实行经济核算制以来，有很多经理都说经理不好当；我自己对经济核算制学习得还不够，现在调任长沙采购供应站经理，这个工作十分繁重；但是相信在党的领导下，只要继续努力，牢记着社会主义企业必须依靠群众积极性的道理，努力学习先进经验和社会主义经营方法，是能够把工作做好的。
