The United States Intensifies Efforts to Squeeze Out British Influence in Egypt
Du Yunxie

On May 11, British Prime Minister Churchill delivered a speech on foreign policy in the House of Commons, denouncing Egyptian Prime Minister Naguib as "making or being made a dictator of Egypt without any electoral basis," and declared that Britain would "exercise self-defense" in Egypt. On the same day, U.S. Secretary of State Dulles issued a statement in Cairo, calling Naguib a "hero" and saying he was "one of the most outstanding leaders of the free world after the war." Such confrontational remarks between Dulles and Churchill are just the latest obvious example of the increasingly acute contradictions between the United States and Britain in Egypt. As everyone knows, since the end of World War II, the United States has been trying its best to infiltrate the Middle East from all aspects, and it has been constantly trying to squeeze out the British forces that have controlled Egypt for decades, especially in Egypt, which occupies an important strategic position.

Egypt's territory includes the fertile Nile River basin in Africa and the Sinai Peninsula in Asia, facing Europe across the Mediterranean Sea. It is the bridge between Europe, Asia, and Africa. Egypt controls the eastern exit of the Mediterranean Sea, which is an important waterway from Europe to the Far East, the Suez Canal. The Nile Delta is rich in high-quality cotton and grain, and the Sinai Peninsula and the west coast of the Red Sea also contain abundant oil.

After British imperialism bombarded Alexandria in 1882 and conquered Egypt by force, it had been the direct or indirect ruler of Egypt. The British government held 44 percent of the shares of the Suez Canal Company. It also established the largest military base in the Middle East in the area of ninety miles long and sixty miles wide along the Suez Canal. This base could supply forty-one army divisions, huge naval forces, and about seventy squadrons of military aircraft.

After World War II, the United States launched an attack on Britain's "sphere of influence," which had been greatly weakened during the war, on a global scale. In the Middle East and Near East, in addition to seizing oil fields in countries around the Persian Gulf, establishing economic positions, and supporting Israel in Palestine as its military base in the Middle East, the United States also aimed its offensive at Egypt, an important strategic region.

The economic squeeze of Britain's position in Egypt by the United States is evident in the struggle for commodity sales markets. According to Egypt's "Al-Ahram" newspaper, the value of American goods imported into Egypt in 1952 exceeded that of the United Kingdom and ranked first. In 1952, the United States' exports to Egypt were more than 36 million Egyptian pounds, while the United Kingdom's were only more than 29 million Egyptian pounds. However, in 1946, the United Kingdom's exports to Egypt were more than 24.9 million Egyptian pounds, while the United States' were only more than 9 million Egyptian pounds.

Not only that, but the United States is also using West German capital under its control to invade Egypt. The American "Time" magazine said that West German experts have taken over various positions on the Egyptian state-owned railways that were previously monopolized by the British. West German engineering companies have won the contract to build the Aswan steel plant, which is the largest of Egypt's industrial projects. In 1951, West German imports to Egypt were 9.8 million Egyptian pounds, which increased to 12.15 million Egyptian pounds in 1952. West German purchases of Egyptian goods also increased from 8.61 million Egyptian pounds to 11.42 million Egyptian pounds during the same period. British Labor Party MP Richard Crossman said angrily after traveling in the Middle East and returning to Britain in January this year that Egypt's trade had been "grabbed by the trade delegation of West Germany."

Cotton, which accounts for 75 percent of Egypt's exports, has been monopolized by Britain for decades. However, since the war, due to the United States' massive purchase of its long-staple cotton, the planting area of Egyptian long-staple cotton has greatly increased. At the same time, the United States has intensified its monopoly on grain imports to Egypt, so Egypt's economic dependence on the United States has gradually deepened. However, the total value of British purchases from Egypt decreased from 47.5 million pounds in 1951 to 12.9 million pounds in 1952.

In the past year, the United States has been stepping up its efforts to seize the Egyptian investment market. In addition to using technical "assistance" as a means to further import capital, it has also obtained oil exploration rights in the Sinai Peninsula to squeeze out Britain's past exclusive control of Egyptian oil. At the same time, the United States has successively sent a group of American "experts" headed by Cabot, a "Boston industrialist and financier" who once served as an advisor to the U.S. State Department, International Bank for Reconstruction and Development President Black, and Eisenhower's economic envoy Coleb Dong to Egypt to "help develop Egyptian industry."

In the political aspect, the United States' conspiracy activities to seize control of Egypt have become more and more blatant since Naguib launched a military coup and seized power in July last year. The American "Newsweek" once revealed the close relationship between Naguib's coup and the United States, saying that the actual initiators of this coup were some young Egyptian officers composed of the "Free Officers Committee." These officers had been trained by former Nazi officers sent by West Germany under the control of the United States. They all expressed dissatisfaction with King Farouk's corrupt regime. Before launching the coup, they "consulted with German advisors on strategic issues."

After Naguib seized power, the United States immediately expressed great satisfaction. "The New York Times" said: "This coup can achieve a good goal." By September last year, when Naguib himself served as prime minister and monopolized military and political power, further strengthening his military dictatorship, the United States expressed even greater joy. The American ruling group believes that Naguib "is a bright hope for the development of the Middle East," and that he is most likely to "reach an agreement with Western countries on the issue of establishing a Middle East defense organization."

After World War II, the movement of the people of the Middle East and Near East countries to strive for national independence soared unprecedentedly, and the contradictions between the colonies, semi-colonies and the suzerain states became increasingly acute. The Egyptian people also firmly demanded that the British army withdraw from the Suez Canal area. On the one hand, the United States and Britain jointly suppressed the anti-imperialist movement of the Middle Eastern people, and at the same time, they also used the difficulties encountered by Britain in the Middle East to expand their influence. It pretended to sympathize with the goal of dependent countries' people to strive for national independence, and engaged in conspiracy activities wearing the mask of a "fair mediator." For example, in the British-Egyptian negotiations on the Sudan issue, due to the intensive activities of the U.S. Ambassador to Egypt, Caffery, under the guise of a "mediator," the British-Egyptian agreement signed on February 12 this year stipulated that in order to prepare Sudan for "transition" to independence, an "election committee" would be established, with an Indian representative serving as chairman, and three Sudanese and one representative each from Britain, Egypt, and the United States. This committee will be responsible for supervising the elections of the Sudanese parliament. This agreement did not end British rule in Sudan. But it is clear that in this way, Britain's position in Sudan has been greatly weakened, while the United States' position has been greatly strengthened. From then on, with the cooperation of the Naguib government, the United States could directly intervene in Sudanese politics and further expand its influence in the Upper Nile region.

Immediately following the signing of the agreement on the Sudan issue, Britain and Egypt began negotiations on the issue of the withdrawal of British troops from the Suez Canal area. The process of negotiations in recent months has shown that the United States is still adopting the same tactics as it did in the Iranian oil issue and the Sudan issue, wearing the mask of a "mediator" and trying to use the conflict between Britain and Egypt to squeeze out Britain's long-standing dominant position in Egypt.

As everyone knows, in October 1951, the United States, in the name of the United States, Britain, France, and Turkey, proposed a "Middle East Command" plan to the Middle East Arab countries. Middle Eastern newspapers pointed out that the purpose of this plan was to turn many of the areas currently occupied solely by Britain in the Middle East, such as the Suez Canal area, Jordan, Iraq and other important military bases, into springboards for aggressive wars also occupied by the United States. Under the widespread and fierce opposition of the people of the Middle East countries, the United States' repeated attempts to put together a conspiracy ended in a disastrous failure.

On March 14 this year, Caffery and the British Ambassador to Egypt, Stevens, submitted to the Egyptian government a so-called "joint proposal" by the United States and Britain on resolving the issue of British troops in the Suez Canal area. This proposal, on the one hand, promised that the British army would "withdraw unconditionally within one year," but on the other hand, it insisted on maintaining a huge military base in the canal area, "supervised" by American and British "experts," and at the same time insisted that Egypt participate in the "Middle East Command" as a condition for troop withdrawal. The intention of this plan is also equally obvious, which is to turn the Suez Canal area, which has been occupied solely by Britain for more than seventy years, into a military base jointly occupied by the United States and Britain, and according to the original plan of the "Middle East Command" as an affiliated organization of the North Atlantic Alliance, the United States will also become the commander of this military base in the future, like in many other bases of the North Atlantic Alliance, Britain can only occupy the position of "sidekick."

Under the pressure of the Egyptian people, the Egyptian government rejected this US-British proposal. Because Britain later insisted on occupying the Suez Canal area, the British-Egyptian negotiations were officially declared adjourned indefinitely on May 6. Then, Dulles arrived in Cairo on May 11 and began his so-called "fact-finding trip" to twelve countries in the Middle East, Near East and South Asia. Accompanying him were Stassen, the director of the Mutual Security Agency in charge of "American aid," and Bylod, the U.S. Assistant Secretary of State who went to London earlier this year to put pressure on the British government to "resolve" the British-Egyptian dispute. According to a correspondent for Pakistan's "Dawn" newspaper in London, Britain felt "uneasy" about Dulles' "trip" to the Middle East, because Britain still believed that its influence in the Middle East surpassed everything else. France's "Le Monde" revealed that the British-Egyptian negotiations were interrupted on the eve of Dulles' arrival in Cairo in order to prevent the United States and Arab countries from reaching a direct agreement. After Dulles left Egypt after his activities in Cairo, he issued a statement saying that Naguib's plans and programs "will be important not only to Egypt, but to the whole world." The London "Daily Worker" pointed out that the plans and programs that Naguib has announced are to deal with Britain, therefore, Dulles' statement "can only be regarded as a slap in the face to the British Conservative Prime Minister." When Dulles returned to Washington from the Middle East and spoke to reporters about his impressions of this trip, he said that the United States was "working hard" to free the Middle East countries that had "been under long-term foreign rule." Everyone knows that the "foreign country" that has ruled the Middle East for a long time is Britain. This once again blatantly showed the ambition of the United States to invade Egypt in order to squeeze out Britain.

At present, the movement of the people of the Middle East and Near East to strive for national independence is rising day by day, and the social contradictions within the countries of this region are also deepening day by day. Under such circumstances, the US and British imperialists are desperately fighting for hegemony over this region in order to seek maximum profits, so the contradictions between them are becoming more and more acute. Due to Egypt's strategic position and abundant natural resources, the increasingly acute US-British contradictions manifested in the Egyptian issue have become the most prominent of the many contradictions between the US and Britain in the Middle East.

    美国加紧排挤英国在埃及的势力
    杜运燮
    五月十一日，英国首相邱吉尔在下议院发表外交问题演说，斥埃及首相纳吉布是“不通过任何的选举基础，使自己成为或被捧为埃及的独裁者”，并且声言英国要在埃及“实行自卫”。就在同一天，美国国务卿杜勒斯却在开罗发表声明，称纳吉布为“英雄”，说他是“战后自由世界的最特出的领袖之一”。杜勒斯和邱吉尔的这种针锋相对的言论，不过是美英在埃及的日趋尖锐化的矛盾的最近一个明显例子。大家知道，第二次世界大战结束以来，美国竭力从各方面侵入中东，而对于占有战略重要地位的埃及，更是不断想法排挤几十年来控制着埃及的英国势力。
    埃及的领土包括有非洲肥沃的尼罗河流域和亚洲的西奈半岛，隔着地中海，北面就是欧洲，正是所谓欧、亚、非三洲的桥梁地带。埃及扼着地中海的东面出口——也就是欧洲到远东的重要水道苏彝士运河。尼罗河三角洲盛产品质优良的棉花和粮食，西奈半岛和红海西岸还蕴藏有丰富的石油。
    英帝国主义在一八八二年炮轰亚历山大港，用武力征服了埃及以后，它一直是埃及的直接或间接的统治者。英国政府握有苏彝士运河公司百分之四十四的股票。它并在苏彝士运河两旁长九十英里、宽六十英里的范围内，建立了中东最庞大的军事基地，这个基地可以供应陆军四十一个师、巨大的海军部队和约七十个中队的军用飞机。
    第二次世界大战以后，美国在全世界范围内展开了对在战时大大削弱了的英国的“势力范围”的进攻。在中东和近东，美国除在波斯湾周围各国夺取油田、建立经济阵地，并在巴勒斯坦扶植以色列作为它在中东的军事基地之外，同时也把进攻的矛头对着埃及这个重要战略地区。
    美国在经济上排挤英国在埃及的地位，明显地表现在争夺商品销售市场的斗争上。据埃及“金字塔报”报道，美国在一九五二年输入埃及的商品已超过英国而居第一位。在一九五二年，美国对埃及的输出为三千六百多万埃镑，英国只有二千九百多万埃镑，但在一九四六年，英国对埃及的输出为二千四百九十多万埃镑，而美国只有九百多万埃镑。
    不仅如此，美国同时还利用它控制下的西德资本侵入埃及。美国“时代”周刊说，西德专家已取得了过去由英国人垄断的埃及国营铁路上的各种职位。西德的工程公司已取得了建造阿斯万钢厂的合同，这个钢厂是埃及工业计划中最大的一个。在一九五一年，西德输入埃及商品为九百八十万埃镑，到了一九五二年已增加到一千二百十五万埃镑；西德购买埃及的货物在同时期也由八百六十一万埃镑增加到一千一百四十二万埃镑。英国工党议员理查德·克罗斯曼在今年一月间从中东旅行回到英国后愤愤地说，埃及的贸易已被西德贸易代表团“一手抓去了”。
    在埃及出口货中占百分之七十五的棉花，几十年来一直由英国垄断着。但战后以来，由于美国大量搜购它的长纤维棉花，埃及长纤维棉花的播种面积大为增加，同时美国又加紧垄断对埃及的粮食输入，因而埃及在经济上对美国的依赖性就逐渐加深。但英国向埃及购物的总值却由一九五一年的四千七百五十万英镑，减少到一九五二年的一千二百九十万英镑。
    最近一年来，美国更在加紧争夺埃及的投资市场。除利用技术“援助”的手段以便进一步输入资本之外，并在西奈半岛取得了石油开采权，以排挤过去英国单独控制埃及石油的地位。同时美国还接连派遣了以曾任美国国务院顾问的“波士顿的实业家和金融家”卡波特为首的一批美国“专家”、国际复兴开发银行行长布莱克、艾森豪威尔的经济特使考尔勃东等到埃及，“帮助发展埃及工业”。
    在政治方面，美国为了争夺对埃及的控制权而进行的阴谋活动，自从去年七月间纳吉布发动军事政变而取得政权以来，已越来越露骨。美国“新闻周刊”曾透露纳吉布发动政变和美国的密切关系说，实际发动这个政变的是一些年青埃及军官组成的
    “自由军官委员会”。这些军官都曾受过美国控制下的西德派去的前纳粹军官的训练。他们都对法鲁克国王的腐败政权表示不满。他们在发动政变之前，
    “曾就策略问题和德国顾问磋商”。
    纳吉布取得政权后，美国立即表示很满意。“纽约时报”说：“这次政变可以达到一个良好的目标。”到了去年九月间，纳吉布自己兼任首相独揽军政大权，进一步加强他的军事独裁以后，美国表示更加高兴。美国统治集团认为纳吉布“对于中东的发展是光明的希望”，认为他最可能“在成立中东防御组织问题上和西方国家达成协议”。
    第二次世界大战以后，中东、近东各国人民争取民族独立的运动空前高涨，殖民地、半殖民地和宗主国之间的矛盾日趋尖锐化。埃及人民也坚决要求英军退出苏彝士运河区。美国一方面和英国共同镇压中东人民的反对帝国主义运动，同时也在利用英国在中东所遭遇的困难，扩张它的势力。它假装同情附属国人民的争取民族独立的目标，戴着“公正的调停人”的假面具从事阴谋活动。例如在英埃关于苏丹问题的谈判中，由于美国驻埃及大使卡弗里在“调停人”幌子下的紧张活动，在今年二月十二日签订的英埃协定中规定，为准备苏丹“过渡”到独立地位，设立一个“选举委员会”，由一个印度代表担任主席，三个苏丹人和英、埃、美代表各一名组成。这个委员会将负责监督苏丹议会的选举。这个协定并没有结束英国在苏丹的统治。但是很显然，这样一来，英国在苏丹的地位已被大大削弱，而美国的地位却大为加强。从此以后，美国在纳吉布政府的策应之下，就可以直接干预苏丹政治，进一步扩张它在上尼罗河流域的势力了。
    紧接着关于苏丹问题的协定的签订，英国和埃及开始进行关于撤退苏彝士运河区英国驻军问题的谈判。最近几个月来谈判的过程表明，美国仍然采取它在伊朗石油问题和苏丹问题上的同样手段，戴着
    “调停人”的假面具，力图利用英国和埃及的冲突，排挤英国长期以来在埃及的优势地位。
    大家知道，美国在一九五一年十月间曾以美、英、法、土耳其四国名义向中东阿拉伯国家提出一个“中东司令部”计划。中东各国报纸指出，这个计划的目的就是要把目前英国在中东的许多单独占领的地区，如苏彝士运河区、外约旦、伊拉克等重要军事基地，变为美国也参加占领的侵略战争跳板。这个计划在中东各国人民普遍激烈反对下，美国多次企图拼凑的阴谋都宣告惨败。
    今年三月十四日，卡弗里又和英国驻埃及大使施谛文向埃及政府提出了一个所谓关于解决苏彝士运河区英国驻军问题的美英“联合建议”。这个建议
    一方面答应英军“在一年内无条件撤退”，另一方
    面却坚持要在运河区维持一个巨大军事基地，由美国和英国的“专家”实行“监督”，同时仍坚持埃及要参加“中东司令部”作为撤军的交换条件。这个计划的用意也同样明显，就是要把七十多年来英国单独占领的苏彝士运河区，变成美英共同占领的军事基地，而且根据“中东司令部”作为北大西洋联盟的一个附属机构的原来计划，将来美国还要成为这个军事基地的发号施令者，像在北大西洋联盟的其他许多基地一样，英国只能占有“小伙计”的地位。
    埃及政府在埃及人民的压力下拒绝了这个美英建议。因为后来英国仍坚持要占领苏彝士运河区，英埃谈判并在五月六日正式宣告无限期休会。接着，杜勒斯在五月十一日到达开罗，开始他的在中近东和南亚十二个国家的所谓“调查事实旅行”。和他同行的有管理“美援”的共同安全署署长史塔生和今年初为“解决”英埃纠纷而到伦敦对英国政府施压力的美国助理国务卿拜娄德。杜勒斯和纳吉布密谈了几次，并转交了艾森豪威尔给纳吉布的私人信和赠送给他的一把手枪。据巴基斯坦“黎明报”驻伦敦记者报道，英国对于杜勒斯在中东的“旅行”，感到“不安”，因为英国仍认为它在中东的影响是超过一切的。法国“世界报”透露，英埃谈判正在杜勒斯到达开罗的前夕中断，是英国政府为了要防止美国和阿拉伯国家达到直接的协议。杜勒斯在开罗活动后离开埃及时曾发表声明说，纳吉布的计划和方案“不但将对于埃及，而且对于全世界都很重要”。伦敦“工人日报”指出，纳吉布已经宣布过的计划和方案，就是要对付英国，因此，杜勒斯的这个声明“只能认为是对英国保守党首相打了一个耳光”。杜勒斯由中东回到华盛顿后对记者发表这次旅行的观感时说，美国正“努力”使中东“受过长期外国统治”的各国得到自由。谁都知道长期统治中东的“外国”就是英国。这就又一次露骨地表示了美国要侵入埃及以排挤英国的野心。
    目前，中东、近东人民争取民族独立的运动正日益高涨，这地区各国国内的社会矛盾也日渐加深。就在这种情况下，美英帝国主义都为了谋取最高限度的利润，拚命争夺对这个地区的霸权，因而它们之间的矛盾越来越尖锐。由于埃及的战略地位和天然资源丰富，表现在埃及问题上的日益尖锐化的美英矛盾，也就成为美英在中东的许多矛盾中的最突出的一个。
