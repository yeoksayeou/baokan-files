    State-owned Commerce Must Serve Industrial Production
    State-owned commerce should actively promote industrial products and serve industrial production. However, since the first quarter of this year, in the process of improving management and implementing economic accounting in the state-owned commercial system, a situation completely contrary to this correct policy has become relatively common. This involves setting the clearing of assets and verification of capital and the reduction of inventory against the active organization of goods sources, and setting the acceleration of capital turnover against the expansion of sales and the guarantee of market supply. As a result, factories have accumulated products while the market is out of stock, seriously affecting the normal development of production and the market supply. Taking the situation in Northeast China as an example: in the first quarter, state-owned commerce in Northeast China only completed 60% of its intra-regional procurement plan, and only 50% of its extra-regional procurement plan. In February, the total value of domestic procurement was only 33% of the total sales value. Because state-owned commerce in Northeast China did not actively expand commodity sales, local state-owned industries in Northeast China accumulated more than 470 billion yuan worth of products. As a result, some factories are experiencing a severe shortage of working capital, not only universally using their profit remittances, but also mainly relying on bank loans to maintain production. Some factories have already stopped or reduced production.
    This phenomenon of not actively expanding commodity sales is also widespread in other regions. Some state-owned commercial departments use the method of "buying now and selling now, buying less and selling less" to operate state-owned commerce. The Taizhou Cotton Yarn and Cloth Wholesale Store in Zhejiang Province, for example, only purchases ten or eight bolts of cloth at a time. As a result, the goods brought in the morning are sold out in the morning, and the goods brought in the afternoon are sold out in the afternoon, causing consumers to rush to buy and the market to run out of stock. Due to the shortage of cotton yarn, the local dyeing and weaving industry was once forced to stop work and wait for materials. Some state-owned commercial departments, disregarding the current production situation in our country, blindly pursue "famous brands" and "fast-moving goods," neglecting the processing and procurement of locally marketable industrial products or handicrafts. In the first quarter, the Changsha Department Store Supply Station completed 115% of its procurement plan for goods from Shanghai, while only completing 65% of its local processing orders. Many state-owned commercial departments, for the sake of their own economic accounting, even adopt the practice of harming others to benefit themselves, increasing calculation costs. Due to excessively high prices, the sales of industrial products are inevitably affected.
    The basic task of state-owned commerce is to develop production and ensure supply. The purpose of implementing the economic accounting system in state-owned commerce is to better achieve this task. Implementing the economic accounting system includes expanding commodity circulation, accelerating capital turnover, and reducing commodity circulation costs, which are a unified whole in business activities and are inseparable. Therefore, it is wrong to only pay attention to reducing inventory without actively organizing sources of goods and expanding sales, and this must be quickly corrected.
    This year, our country has entered a period of economic construction. With the development of industrial and agricultural production, the needs of the people will continue to grow. The peak sales season this year is also approaching, so state-owned commercial departments must take a responsible attitude of actively opening up sales channels for industrial products, strive to organize sources of goods, and make early preparations for materials for the peak season. It should be recognized that seasonal reserves and the necessary reserves for certain adjustments are indispensable. We cannot place orders temporarily during the sales season, because production requires a certain process. We must distinguish between normal reserves and accumulated inventory. Being afraid of accumulation and not daring to carry out necessary reserves will result in real accumulation. In the past, many commodities were "scarce in summer and abundant in autumn, scarce in autumn and available in spring." This lesson should be remembered. Commercial workers should also recognize the fact that the production of "famous brands" in our country today cannot fully meet the needs of the people nationwide. Therefore, we cannot demand too much or too many "famous brands." In fact, the commodities currently out of stock are not only "famous brands," but also a shortage of a small number of non-"famous brands." And what affects market supply and causes the most dissatisfaction among consumers is the shortage of a large number of non-"famous brands." Therefore, the erroneous thinking of blindly pursuing "famous brands," "fast-moving goods," and high-profit commodities, without actively promoting slow-selling goods, low-profit commodities, and local industrial products must also be corrected. Of course, the phenomenon of blind procurement by state-owned commercial departments should also be prevented.
    Another important aspect of state-owned commerce serving production is to actively influence and urge production units to improve the quality of products to meet market needs. State-owned commerce should investigate the status of industrial production and the needs of society, and, according to the needs of the people, put forward opinions to production units on improving product quality, so as to give play to the influence of state-owned commerce on production.
    Of course, some production units in the past also had serious shortcomings: emphasizing quantity and neglecting quality, burying themselves in production, and not asking about the market, so that the quality of certain products was low, prices were too high, and the variety of specifications was monotonous, which could not fully meet the needs of the market. This is also one of the reasons why state-owned commerce is unwilling to actively purchase goods.
    Now production and sales units have begun to pay attention to this situation and have created many experiences. For example, the specifications and colors of knitwear in Qingdao, Shandong Province, were originally not in line with market needs. The Qingdao Department Store Wholesale Station took the initiative to invite technicians from the factory to participate in supply meetings, listen to opinions on products from various places, and jointly organized a special team to study and improve production methods. At present, the quality of Qingdao knitwear has been greatly improved. This experience should be promoted.

### 国营商业要为工业生产服务

    国营商业要为工业生产服务
    国营商业应该积极推销工业产品，为工业生产服务。但从今年第一季度以来，国营商业系统在改善经营管理、实行经济核算制的过程中，比较普遍地发生了与这种正确的方针完全相反的情况。这就是把清产核资、压缩库存与积极组织货源对立起来，把加速资金周转与扩大推销、保证市场供应对立起来，结果造成了工厂积压产品而市场脱销的现象，严重地影响了生产的正常发展和市场的供应。仅以东北区的情况为例：东北国营商业第一季度的区内进货计划只完成了百分之六十，区外进货计划仅完成了百分之五十，二月份的国内进货总值仅相当于推销总值的百分之三十三。由于东北国营商业不积极扩大商品推销，东北地方国营工业就积压了四千七百余亿元的产品；结果，有些工厂的流动资金极感缺乏，不仅普遍占用了上缴利润，并且主要依靠银行的贷款维持生产，有些工厂已经停产或减产了。
    这种不积极扩大商品推销的现象，在其他地区也普遍存在。有些地区的国营商业部门采用“现买现卖，少买少卖”的办法来经营国营商业。浙江省台州花纱布批发商店就是十匹八匹地进货，结果上午调来上午卖光，下午调来下午卖光，消费者抢购，市场脱销；由于棉纱的脱销，当地染织工业曾经停工待料。有些国营商业部门不顾我国目前的生产情况，盲目地追逐“名牌货”、“快货”，忽视了对当地有销路的工业品或手工业品的加工和采购。长沙百货供应站第一季度的进货计划中，上海货完成了百分之一百一十五，而本地加工订货只完成了百分之六十五。还有很多国营商业部门为了本身的经济核算，竟至采取损人利己的作法，加高计算费用。由于价格过高，必然影响了工业品的销路。
    国营商业的基本任务是发展生产、保证供应。国营商业实行经济核算制的目的，就是为了更好地实现这个任务。贯彻经济核算制包括扩大商品流转、加速资金周转和降低商品流转费用三个方面，这在业务活动上是统一的整体，是不可分割的。因此，只注意压缩库存，不积极组织货源和扩大推销的做法是错误的，必须迅速加以纠正。
    今年我国已进入经济建设时期，随着工农业生产的发展，人民的需要也将不断增长。今年的贸易旺季也将到来了，因此国营商业部门必须以积极为工业品打开销路的负责态度，努力组织货源，提前做好旺季的物资准备。应该认识：季节储备与一定调剂所需要的储备是不可少的，我们不能在销货季节临时订货，因为生产是需要一定过程的。我们要把正常的储备与积压加以区别，害怕积压而不敢进行必要的储备，结果就会造成真正的积压。过去有很多商品是“夏缺秋多，秋缺春来”，这种教训是应该记取的。商业工作者还应认清这种事实：我国今天“名牌货”的生产还不能充分满足全国人民需要，所以，我们不能对“名牌货”要求过高过多，事实上，目前脱销的商品，不只是“名牌货”，少数非“名牌货”也是供应不足的。而影响市场供应，引起消费者最不满意的，正是大量非“名牌货”的脱销。因此，那种盲目追逐“名牌货”、“快货”和利润高的商品，而不积极推销滞销品、利润低的商品和地方工业产品的错误思想也必须纠正过来。当然，国营商业部门盲目进货的现象，也应该加以防止。
    国营商业为生产服务的另一个重要方面，就是积极影响和督促生产单位改进产品的质量，以适应市场的需要。国营商业应该调查工业生产状况和社会的需要状况，根据人民的需要，向生产单位提出改进产品质量的意见，以发挥国营商业对生产的影响作用。
    当然，过去某些生产单位也有严重的缺点：重数量轻质量，埋头生产，不问市场，以致某些产品质量低劣、价格过高、品种规格单调，不能完全适应市场的需要。这也是国营商业不愿积极进货的一个原因。
    现在生产和销售单位已开始注意了这种情况，并已创造了很多的经验。例如：山东青岛市的针织品，规格花色原不合市场需要。青岛百货批发站主动地请工厂派技师参加供应会议，听取各地对产品的意见，又联合组织了专门小组，共同研究改进生产的办法，目前青岛针织品的质量已大为提高。这种经验应该推广。
