    A Self-Criticism Regarding the Shipping of Decayed Timber from Northeast China and Poor Timber Management
    Li Nansheng, Manager of China Coal Construction Company
    The situation revealed by the People's Daily on February 22nd regarding the shipping of decayed timber from Northeast China and the poor timber management of the China Coal Construction Company is completely true, and the criticisms raised are entirely correct. We sincerely accept them. In addition to requesting that higher authorities give appropriate punishment to those who have neglected their duties, we offer the following self-criticism:
    The nature of this incident is extremely serious, and the losses caused to the state are astonishing. The loss from price differences alone amounts to 11.15 billion yuan, and 1,426 railcars were wasted. As for the losses due to raising the grade of timber, deceiving basic construction units, seriously affecting the quality of projects, shortening their lifespan, and causing work-related accidents, these are incalculable.
    These losses are caused by our serious bureaucratic work style. As early as the second half of 1951, various regions reported that some of the timber shipped from Northeast China to within the customs area was decayed. After the timber shipment contract was signed in May 1952, this phenomenon was discovered continuously. We did not severely criticize this behavior, which violated the contract provisions and the interests of the state, or this departmentalism and disregard for policy in management thinking. Nor did we take decisive measures to immediately stop the shipment of decayed timber, investigate responsibility, and seriously deal with it. Instead, we adopted an intolerable bureaucratic attitude, only using official documents to notify the Northeast Coal Construction Company to "pay attention," "pay close attention," "correct," and "resolutely stop," etc. In these official documents, even the statement "The Northeast Coal Construction Company shall be responsible for compensating for the substandard timber entering the customs area" was not mentioned. Despite our constant notifications to stop it, substandard timber continued to arrive. Later, we sent people to Tianjin, Shijiazhuang, Shenyang and other places for inspection; although the phenomenon of decayed timber entering the customs area was stopped at the end of July last year, we have not been able to completely clarify the situation of rotten timber entering the customs area and effectively stop it. Why couldn't we effectively stop the substandard timber entering the customs area and turn a blind eye to the losses suffered by the state? Mainly because we lacked a conscious spirit of responsibility to the state and the people, and lacked a sense of discipline and policy. We did not resolutely fight against violations of laws and regulations. We only knew how to sit in the office and issue orders, and we knew nothing about the Northeast Regional Company's bad behavior such as "blindly increasing the material output rate," "using bad materials to replace good materials," and "promoting construction materials in processing plants"; we did not sufficiently recognize the severity of the decayed timber entering the customs area and its serious harm to the state. We also had a wrong idea that in order to maintain good relations, we should be generous to the Northeast Regional Company to maintain the style of the head office. This prevented us from seriously checking the implementation of the contract and resolutely stopping the phenomenon of decayed timber entering the customs area. In fact, this is a concrete manifestation of being generous with the state's resources and being irresponsible for the state's assets.
    The serious errors in the management of timber within the customs area are also inseparable from our bureaucratic work style. At the beginning of 1952, we received fragmentary reports from Beijing, Tianjin and other places about raising the grade of timber, but we did not pay enough attention to it. We only mentioned this issue at the symposium of technical and business personnel, and did not conduct in-depth inspections to stop it. We did not even ask about it when inspecting the substandard timber entering the customs area, so this bad behavior was able to grow and develop, and later occurred in many units in North China. Regarding the issue of timber sorting, we only issued a notice, putting forward the general slogan of "pricing according to quality," and did not go deep into the grassroots to provide specific assistance, let alone cultivate typical examples, absorb experience, and promote it in an all-round way. As a result, many places carried out timber sorting while groping, spending a lot of time and money, and taking many detours. Our ideological and political leadership over the cadres of the entire system is very weak, and we lack the idea of relying on the working class. Therefore, the safety and welfare of workers are generally not valued in various parts of North China, and work-related accidents occur frequently. Even individual places (such as Tianjin) deceive workers by calculating more and paying less, calculating longer distances as shorter ones, and "finding ways to save money" in the wages that should be paid to workers when moving timber.
    Leading cadres at all levels have not delved into the timber business. As Comrade Xin Zhenhuan said, after engaging in it for several years, they are still completely laymen in timber. The business and technical level of general cadres is far behind the needs of the work, which has also caused great losses to the work. In addition, we have always not valued the timber business and mistakenly believed that the amount of timber we operate is not large, and most of it is substandard materials, thus producing the idea of "underestimating equipment and materials." This wrong idea has resulted in two bad consequences: First, we did not fully recognize the complexity of the timber business, and did not make up our minds to solve the problems of cadres, factory sites and safety equipment. Second, we only emphasized that the old, substandard, and other grade materials are a large amount of national wealth and must be vigorously promoted, and we did not seriously educate all timber cadres to resolutely prohibit the use of substandard materials for basic construction. When it was discovered that the substandard materials from Northeast China were entering the customs area, we did not clearly instruct the lower levels on how to handle this batch of timber. In 1952, the Northeast Forestry Department changed the other grade materials to Grade 4 materials, but in the first quarter of 1953, we still generally and blindly instructed various places to vigorously promote the other grade materials (Central South and East China also have other grade materials), so that the events of raising the grade for sale and deceiving basic construction units occurred in various parts of North China.
    We have not correctly understood the proper status and role of the China Coal Construction Company and the responsibilities it should bear to the country and the people. We often only consider how to facilitate our own operations, and rarely or never consider the overall interests of the country and the interests of millions of people. We often only see the current interests and rarely or never see the long-term interests. Our ideological level is not high, we do not study enough, and we believe that we have achieved something in our work in the past three years, so we have developed a sense of arrogance and complacency. We lack political sensitivity, lack a sense of new things, and lack the idea of relying on the masses. This makes us stick to conventions and stand still, unable to correctly understand the status and role of the coal construction business, and unable to fulfill our due responsibilities to the country and the people.
    The main ideological enemies currently existing in our company system are bureaucracy, the supply system management ideology, departmentalism, and the management ideology that disregards policies. These problems exist not only in the Northeast and North China Coal Construction Company systems, but are generally present in the entire Coal Construction Company system. If they are not thoroughly overcome and eliminated, they will inevitably cause more serious losses to the country, prevent us from effectively implementing the economic accounting system, and inevitably put our enterprises to death. Therefore, first of all, under the leadership of the Party and the People's Government, we must systematically and deeply launch a struggle against bureaucracy, against departmentalism, against deceiving users, against non-execution of policies, and against non-execution of contracts within the scope of the national coal construction company system in connection with our work. Emphasize the consistency between policy implementation and task completion, and establish a socialist commercial style and morality that implements policies and conforms to economic accounting.
    Secondly, we must strengthen the political and ideological leadership of coal construction companies at all levels to enhance the guaranteeing role of political work in enterprises, and thoroughly eliminate the erroneous ideas of not relying on the working class and not valuing the timber business. We will order all localities to earnestly check the safety and welfare work of workers, immediately solve all possible problems, and resolutely eliminate worker injuries and deaths.
    Thirdly, we must resolutely find out the existing assets and strive to gradually achieve consistency between accounts and goods. The head office will send a working group to go deep into the lower levels to find out the key issues in finding out the existing assets and the main methods for solving the problem of consistency between accounts and goods. In the process of finding out the existing assets, we will also study and solve how to simplify procedures, implement a joint office system for three employees (accounting, business, and storage and transportation), clarify the central idea of serving the business in everything, and instruct each province and city company to select one or two typical examples to gain experience and promote them.
    Fourthly, we must earnestly strengthen business learning. It is stipulated that the business learning of timber cadres throughout the system should mainly focus on learning timber technology, and regular summaries should be made. Leading cadres at all levels must take the lead in learning, and are required to learn basic technology within three months. It is recommended that local commercial administrative departments strengthen supervision and urge, and give necessary criticism and punishment to the leading cadres of coal construction companies who neither understand the timber business nor are willing to study timber, and even remove them from their leadership positions. The head office and relevant provincial and municipal companies will hold timber technology cadre training courses to train timber technology cadres. In the field, we will promote the method of teaching and learning to cultivate grassroots technical personnel.
    Fifthly, we must establish a sense of discipline and policy, improve the contract system, and severely punish behaviors that do not implement contracts or even violate contracts. The obligations of both parties and the penalties for violating the contract must be clearly stipulated in the contract.
    Sixthly, we must strengthen the education on protecting timber, establish necessary storage systems (convene a meeting of grassroots storage personnel to formulate a plan for trial implementation), add fire safety equipment, and improve the sense of responsibility of storage personnel.

    关于运送东北腐朽木材进关和对木材经营管理不善的检讨
    中国煤建公司经理  李南生
    二月二十二日人民日报揭发的运送东北腐朽木材进关和中国煤建公司对木材经营管理不善等情形是完全真实的，提出的批评是完全正确的，我们诚恳地接受。除了请求上级对失职人员分别给以应得处分外，并做以下的检讨：
    这个事件的性质是非常严重的，它给国家造成的损失是很惊人的。仅差价损失一项即达一一一五亿元，并浪费车皮一四二六个。至于因为提高木材等级，欺骗基本建设单位而严重地影响工程质量，缩短工程寿命，造成工伤事故等的损失，更是不可计量。
    这些损失是我们的严重的官僚主义作风所造成的。远在一九五一年下半年，各地就反映东北运进关内的木材中有腐朽木材。一九五二年五月份签订木材进关合同以后，又陆续发现了这种现象。我们对这种违反合同规定，违犯国家利益的行为，对这种本位主义和不顾政策的经营思想，不是严加批判，并采取断然措施立即停止运送腐朽木材，并追查责任，严肃加以处理，而是采取了不可容忍的官僚主义态度，只用公文通知东北煤建公司“注意”，“严加注意”，“纠正”，“坚决停止”等等。在这些公文上面甚至连“进关的不合标准的木材须由东北煤建公司负责赔偿”的话都未曾提及。我们尽管不断地通知制止，而等外材却照旧源源而来。后来我们又派人到天津、石家庄、沈阳等地进行检查；虽然在去年七月底制止了腐木进关的现象，但对朽材进关却一直未能彻底搞清情况，加以有效制止。为什么我们对进关的等外材不能有效制止，对国家遭受的损失熟视无睹呢？主要地是由于我们缺乏自觉的对国家对人民负责的精神，缺乏纪律观点和政策观点，不去与违法乱纪现象作坚决斗争。我们只知道坐在机关里发号施令，而对东北区公司“盲目提高出材率”、“以坏材顶替好材”、“在加工场推销建筑材”等恶劣行为却一无所知；对进关腐朽木材的严重程度及其对国家的严重危害则认识不足。我们还存在着一种错误想法，认为要搞好关系，对东北区公司就应该大方一些，才够总公司的派头。这就阻碍了我们认真检查合同执行情况和坚决制止腐朽木材进关的现象。事实上这是慷国家之慨，对国家资财不负责任的具体表现。
    关内木材经营管理上的严重错误，同样是与我们的官僚主义作风分不开的。在一九五二年初，我们就得到了北京、天津等地提高木材等级的片断反映，但没有加以高度的重视，仅在技术、业务人员座谈会上提到这个问题，没有深入检查制止，甚至在检查进关等外材时也未加以过问，因而使这种恶劣行为得以滋长和发展，后来在华北区不少单位都发生了。对于木材排队问题，我们也只是发出一纸通知，提出了“按质论价”的一般号召，没有深入基层作具体帮助，更没有培养典型，吸收经验，全面推广，以致不少地方在摸索中进行木材排队，花费了不少时间和费用，走了很多弯路。我们对全系统干部的思想、政治领导十分薄弱，缺乏依靠工人阶级的思想，因此华北各地普遍不重视工人的安全和福利，工伤事故不断发生，甚至有个别地方（如天津）在搬运木材时以多算少，以远算近，欺骗工人，在应给工人的工资中“找节约窍门”。
    各级领导干部对木材业务没有钻进去，正如辛镇寰同志所说的：搞了好几年，对木材仍然完全是外行。一般干部的业务技术水平远远落后于工作的需要，也给工作造成了很大损失。加以我们一贯地不重视木材业务，错误地认为我们经营的木材数量不大，而且大部分是次材，因而产生了“轻器材”的思想。这种错误思想发生了两个恶果：第一、对木材业务的复杂性认识不足，没有下决心解决干部、厂地和安全设备等问题。第二、只是强调了陈次等外材是国家大量财富，必须大力推销，没有认真教育全体木材干部，坚决禁止把次材用去进行基本建设。在发现东北等外材进关时，也没有明确指示下面如何处理这批木材。一九五二年东北林业部门把等外材改为四等材，可是我们在一九五三年第一季度还笼统地盲目地指示各地大力推销等外材（中南、华东也有等外材），以致华北各地就发生提等出售，欺骗基本建设单位的事。
    我们没有正确认识中国煤建公司应有的地位、作用以及它对国家对人民应负的责任，我们往往只是考虑如何才便利于我们本身的经营，没有或很少考虑到国家整体利益和千百万人民的利益，往往只看见当前的利益，没有或很少看见长远的利益。我们思想水平不高，学习不够，自认为三年来在工作上有点成就，因而就产生了骄傲自满的情绪。我们缺乏政治敏感，缺乏对新鲜事物的感觉，缺乏依靠群众的思想，这就使我们故步自封，停留不前，不能够正确认识煤建业务的地位和作用，对国家对人民不能很好地尽到应尽的责任。
    当前存在于我公司系统中主要的思想敌人是官僚主义，供给制经营思想，本位主义和不顾政策的经营思想。这些问题不单是存在于东北、华北煤建公司系统，而是普遍存在于整个煤建公司系统，如不彻底加以克服和肃清，就必然会给国家造成更严重的损失，就不能使我们有效地实行经济核算制，就必然会把我们的企业置于死地。因此，首先必须在党和人民政府的领导下，在全国煤建公司系统范围内系统深入地联系工作开展反对官僚主义、反对本位主义、反对欺骗用户、反对不执行政策、反对不执行合同的斗争。强调执行政策与完成任务的一致性，树立执行政策、合乎经济核算的社会主义商业作风和道德。
    其次要加强对各级煤建公司的政治思想领导，以提高政治工作对企业的保证作用，彻底肃清不依靠工人阶级、不重视木材业务的错误思想。责成各地切实检查工人安全、福利工作，并立即解决一切可能解决的问题，坚决消灭工人伤亡事故。
    第三要坚决摸清家底，争取逐步做到账货相符。总公司要派出一个工作组，深入下层，找出摸清家底的关键问题和解决账货相符问题的主要办法。在摸清家底过程中并研究解决如何简化手续，实行三员（会计、业务、储运）联合办公制，明确一切为业务服务的中心思想，并责成各省、市公司各选择一两个典型，取得经验加以推广。
    第四要切实加强业务学习。规定全系统木材干部的业务学习，一律以学习木材技术做为主要内容，并定期进行总结。各级领导干部必须带头学习，要求在三个月以内学会基本技术。建议各地商业行政部门加强督促，对煤建公司既不懂木材业务、又不肯钻研木材的领导干部，给以必要的批评和处分，一直到撤销他的领导工作。总公司和有关省、市公司举办木材技术干部训练班，培养木材技术干部。在现场中发扬包教包学办法，培养基层技术人员。
    第五要树立纪律、政策观点，健全合同制度，对不执行合同甚至违反合同的行为给以严厉的制裁，在合同上要明确规定双方的义务和违反合同的罚则。
    第六要加强爱护木材的教育，建立必要的保管制度（召开基层保管人员会议制定方案试行），增设防火安全设备，提高保管人员的责任心。
