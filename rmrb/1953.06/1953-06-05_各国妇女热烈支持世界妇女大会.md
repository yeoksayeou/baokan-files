Xinhua News Agency, June 4th – The World Women's Congress is scheduled to open in Copenhagen on the 5th. This congress has received enthusiastic support from the vast number of women in capitalist countries, who have been working hard to prepare for it. In the process of preparing for the congress, women's movements in many countries have been further developed.

In Italy, the work of preparing for the World Women's Congress has become a broad mass movement. More than seventy provinces held women's congresses. In the province of Reggio Emilia, seventy-five thousand women held various gatherings in two months, at which they elected one thousand two hundred representatives to attend the provincial women's congress. In Sicily, two thousand women representatives, representing one hundred thousand Sicilian women, held a congress in Palermo, the first women's congress held in the province. Then, representatives from various provinces held the Italian National Women's Congress from April 10th to 12th, at which representatives were elected to attend the World Women's Congress. In France, the national council of the French Women's Union issued a statement at the end of March calling on French women to participate in the World Women's Congress, which has been widely responded to by French women. Female workers in major cities such as Paris and Marseille have held congresses, at which the female workers expressed their desire to unite and defend their rights to work and life. In the United Kingdom, which is not yet a member of the Women's International Democratic Federation, representatives of women from all walks of life held the Second British National Women's Congress in March. The congress wrote to the Women's International Democratic Federation, expressing its intention to send a delegation to the World Women's Congress. In Austria, Switzerland, Sweden, and other European countries, women have also launched many activities to welcome the World Women's Congress.

The "American Women's Peace Committee" has printed and distributed five thousand copies of the declaration on the World Women's Congress. During the preparation for the congress, American women played a greater role in the nationwide peace movement. More and more women are participating in the movement demanding an immediate end to the Korean War.

Women in Asian countries are enthusiastically preparing for the World Women's Congress. In India, the declaration of the Women's International Democratic Federation calling on women from all countries to participate in the World Women's Congress was printed and distributed in Hindi, English, and Bengali. Many well-known women participated in the National Preparatory Committee. Indian women also widely carried out a fundraising campaign to raise travel expenses for their elected representatives to attend the World Women's Congress. In Japan, the National Federation of Women's Organizations of Japan, a national women's organization established in April, is actively preparing to participate in the World Women's Congress, and its activities have been supported by Japanese trade unions. Japanese women have elected ten representatives to attend the congress, including the famous "Atomic Bomb Painting" artist, Toshiko Akamatsu. In Indonesia and Lebanon, women have also done a lot of work to prepare for the congress.

Xinhua News Agency, Copenhagen, June 4th – Copenhagen is busy receiving women representatives from all over the world who are coming to attend the World Women's Congress, which will open here on June 5th. In the city's gardens and parks, lilacs are in full bloom, and the chestnut trees along the boulevards are budding. The beech trees surrounding the suburbs are densely forested, lush and green. Copenhagen is already in spring—a northern spring with warm sunshine, interspersed with showers.

Copenhagen is preparing to welcome this largest post-war women's congress. Beautiful banners written in six languages are hung high on the buildings of major roads. In front of a picture of a mother holding a child, passing women cannot help but stop and take a look, feeling that the picture is like a painting of herself.

Danish working women are enthusiastically preparing for the congress. In the past few months, women have held hundreds of gatherings and elected nearly eight hundred representatives to attend the congress. They come from different classes and social strata, and they are determined to defend their rights, their children, and their families. In sixty-five factories and enterprises in Copenhagen, women representatives have also been elected in these few days.

The congress will be held in the Sports Palace, which can accommodate one thousand five hundred people. The work of decorating the building has begun. Along with the women representatives from Europe, women representatives from India, Indonesia, Argentina, Brazil, Australia, Mexico, Chile and other countries have recently arrived in batches. Copenhagen has never seen so many women representatives from the People's China. Mrs. Eugénie Cotton, President of the Women's International Democratic Federation, and Mrs. Vaillant-Couturier, Secretary-General, have also arrived in Copenhagen.

The World Women's Congress is a milestone in the history of the women's movement. The congress will be held under the slogan "Defend Women's Rights, Women Act to Defend Children and Peace." Women and mothers who are aware of their serious responsibilities will voice their voices at this great gathering. The congress will open up new prospects for all those who are willing to work to liberate women from political, economic and social constraints, open up new prospects for understanding among women from all countries, and will contribute to the cause of maintaining world peace and security.

    哥本哈根正在准备迎接这次战后规模最大的妇女大会。各要道的大厦上高悬着用六国文字写的漂亮的标语牌，在一幅画着一个母亲怀抱小孩的图画前，过路的妇女都禁不住要停下来看看，觉得这幅画就像是画的她自己。
    丹麦的劳动妇女正热情地进行着筹备大会的工作。在过去几个月里，妇女们举行了数百次集会，并选出了将近八百名代表参加大会。她们来自不同的阶级和社会阶层，她们决心要保卫她们的权利，保卫她们的儿童和家庭。在哥本哈根的六十五个工厂和企业中，这几天也选出了妇女代表。
