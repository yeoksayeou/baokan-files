    The Japanese Communist Party Issues Statement on the Issue of Overseas Chinese in Japan Returning to China
    Condemns the Yoshida Government's Collusion with Chiang Kai-shek Bandits in Taiwan to Deliberately Obstruct Them
    [Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 8th] The Japanese Communist Party issued a statement on May 22nd regarding the issue of overseas Chinese in Japan returning to China. The statement pointed out: The fact that overseas Chinese in Japan have not been able to return to China is due to the Yoshida government's collusion with the remnant Chiang Kai-shek bandits in Taiwan to deliberately obstruct them, and therefore the Yoshida government should be held fully responsible. The statement said: "The Yoshida government is pursuing a policy of alienating the people of Japan and China, hindering trade between the two countries, and allowing Japan to be permanently subjected to American economic exploitation. This policy of the Yoshida government is inseparable from its implementation of a rearmament plan with China and the Soviet Union as hypothetical enemies, and the suppression of democratic movements."
    The statement pointed out that relevant Japanese organizations should make sufficient efforts to force the Yoshida government to agree to the return of overseas Chinese in Japan to China. The Japanese Communist Party calls on all Japanese political parties, democratic groups, and the people of the whole country to protest to the Yoshida government, and demand that the Yoshida government allow overseas Chinese in Japan to return to China on the fourth ship going to China to pick up Japanese expatriates and return the remains of Chinese martyrs who were murdered in incidents such as the "Hanaoka Massacre," and to stop investigating the ideology and collecting intelligence on returning Japanese expatriates.
    Prior to this, the representatives of the Japanese Red Cross Society, the Japan-China Friendship Association, and the Japan Peace Liaison Committee, ten people in total who were originally scheduled to take the fourth ship to China to pick up Japanese expatriates, issued a joint statement on May 20th, pointing out that the issues of assisting overseas Chinese in Japan to return to China and sending the remains of Chinese martyrs of the "Hanaoka Massacre" back to China were fully guaranteed to the Chinese side by Mr. Tadatsugu Shimazu, the head of the Japanese delegation who went to China not long ago to discuss the issue of assisting Japanese expatriates in China to return to their country. The failure to resolve these issues is inconsistent with international credibility, justice, humanity, and peace. The statement also made demands to the Yoshida government, such as allowing overseas Chinese in Japan to return to China on the fourth ship going to China to pick up Japanese expatriates. The ten representatives also handed over the statement to the authorities of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Yoshida government. (Attached picture)

    日本共产党就旅日华侨回国问题发表声明
    谴责吉田政府串通台湾蒋匪故意阻难的行为
    【新华社八日讯】东京消息：日本共产党于五月二十二日就旅日华侨回国问题发表声明。声明指出：旅日华侨至今未能回到中国是由于吉田政府串通台湾国民党残匪故意阻难，因此完全应由吉田政府负责。声明说：“吉田政府执行离间日中两国人民的政策，阻碍两国间的贸易，使日本永久遭受美国的经济剥削。吉田政府的这种政策是和执行以中、苏两国为假想敌人的重整军备计划和镇压民主运动分不开的。”
    声明指出，日本的有关团体要作足够的努力来迫使吉田政府同意旅日华侨回国。日本共产党号召日本各政党、各民主团体以及全国人民一致向吉田政府提出抗议，并要求吉田政府让旅日华侨乘第四次往中国接日侨的船回中国并送回“花冈惨案”等事件中被虐杀的中国烈士的遗骨，停止对归国日侨进行调查思想和收集情报的活动。
    在这以前，原定搭乘第四次来中国接日侨回国的轮船的日本红十字会、日中友好协会和日本和平联络委员会三团体的代表十人，曾在五月二十日发表联合声明指出：协助旅日华侨回国和送“花冈惨案”的中国烈士遗骨回国等问题，都是不久前到中国商谈协助在华日侨回国问题的日方代表团团长岛津忠承向中国方面作了充分保证的。这些问题不能获得解决，是不合于国际信义，不合于正义、人道与和平的。声明也向吉田政府提出了让旅日华侨乘第四次前往中国接日侨回国的船回中国等要求。十个代表并将声明书交给了吉田政府外务省当局。（附图片）
