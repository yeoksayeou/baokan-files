Comrades Representatives, Honored Guests!

	On behalf of the Central People's Government, I extend warm congratulations to the Second National Congress of the All-China Youth Federation.

	Over the past four years, along with the victory of the Chinese People's Great Revolution and the great achievements of various endeavors since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the vast masses of young people of all ethnic groups and all social strata across the country, at the front lines of the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, in the important defense areas and border regions, in factories, mines, rural areas, schools, government offices, and military units, and in various movements and production, study, and work, have all played their due active roles. Young people have made great contributions to the country.

	Facts have proven that the state system and social system of the people's democratic dictatorship under the leadership of the great Chairman Mao Zedong and the Communist Party of China not only improved the political status of Chinese youth and brought new happiness in economic and cultural life, but also provide the greatest guarantee for nurturing and educating Chinese youth to move towards an infinitely bright future. At the same time, Chinese youth can only further enhance their awareness and unleash greater brilliance and the power of youth by loyally dedicating themselves to the cause of the country and the people, and in the process of serving the people.

	Currently, our country is beginning to enter the construction phase of the first Five-Year Plan, and in order to meet the requirements of the national planned construction, we are beginning to conduct elections for the National People's Congress and local people's congresses at all levels. Building a new China that is independent, prosperous, and strong is the long-cherished ideal of Chinese youth and the Chinese people for nearly a century, especially since the May Fourth Movement. Now, the construction period for realizing this great ideal has arrived. We are fully confident that under the leadership of the great Chairman Mao Zedong and the Communist Party of China, young people across the country will be encouraged to join the people of the whole country, to further promote the fine qualities and ideological style of Chinese youth who love the motherland, love the people, are diligent and brave, study hard, and strive for progress, and to make greater contributions to the country and the people in various positions. We are fully confident that through this congress, the unity of young people of all ethnic groups and all social strata across the country will be further expanded and consolidated, and the national youth movement will be further promoted to develop, jointly advancing towards the victory of the national construction cause. We are fully confident that Chinese youth will further strengthen their ties and unity with international youth, and jointly strive for the cause of lasting world peace.

    目前，我们的国家，正开始进入第一个五年计划的建设，并适应国家计划建设的要求，正开始进行全国人民代表大会及地方各级人民代表大会的选举。建设独立富强的新中国，这是近百年来，特别是“五四”运动以来，中国青年和中国人民梦寐以求的理想。现在，实现这个伟大理想的建设时期已经到来了。我们完全相信，全国青年在伟大的毛泽东主席和中国共产党领导下，会欢欣鼓舞地同全国人民一道，更加发扬中国青年热爱祖国，热爱人民，勤劳勇敢，努力学习，力求进步的优良品质和思想作风，在各个岗位上对国家和人民有更大的贡献。我们完全相信，经过这次大会，将更加扩大和巩固全国各民族、各阶层青年的团结，更加推动全国青年运动进一步地发展，共同为争取国家建设事业的胜利而前进。我们完全相信，中国青年将进一步地加强与国际青年的联系和团结，共同为世界持久和平的事业而努力奋斗。
