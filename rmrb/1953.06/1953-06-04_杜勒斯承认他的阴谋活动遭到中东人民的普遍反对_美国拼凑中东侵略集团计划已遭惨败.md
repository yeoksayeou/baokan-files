Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 3rd: U.S. Secretary of State Dulles’ unpopular so-called "fact-finding trip" to twelve countries in the Near East, Middle East, and South Asia ended on May 28th. Upon returning to Washington, he admitted in a speech broadcast on the American national radio on June 1st that his conspiracy activities were universally opposed by the people of various countries in the region, and that the "Middle East Command" plan, which the United States had been trying to put together for more than a year, had suffered a miserable defeat.

Dulles's speech blatantly revealed the U.S.'s ambition for the Near East, Middle East, and South Asia. He said, "Now is the urgent time for the U.S. government to pay more attention to the Near East and South Asia." Because the national liberation movements in these regions are flourishing. And "the Near East is of great strategic importance, it is the bridge between Europe, Asia and Africa." At the same time, "this region has important resources that are closely related to our (the U.S.'s) welfare - oil, manganese, chromium, mica and other minerals." Dulles revealed that the U.S.'s plan is to use dollars "appropriately" in this region under the "common security" plan to obtain "rich rewards."

However, in order to further intrude into the Near East and Middle East, it is necessary to squeeze out Britain, which has long held a dominant position in this region. Regarding this point, Dulles was most blatant when talking about Egypt and the Suez base issue. He said that he and Egyptian dictator Naguib discussed the situation. Dulles believes that regarding the Suez Canal base issue, "the heart of the problem is not the stay of British troops," "the problem lies in the power and management of this huge base, its airports and its supply stations in the future." He said: "The importance of this issue exceeds the scope of Egypt," "the United States is willing to assist in any appropriate way." This is a typical U.S. conspiracy tactic to intervene in the Near East and Middle East.

However, the people of the entire Near East, Middle East, and South Asia have clearly seen through the various conspiracies of the United States. Dulles admitted in the conclusion of his speech: "Most people in the Near East and East Asia are deeply concerned about the political independence of themselves and other people. They suspect colonial countries. The United States is also among those being suspected." Everyone knows that Dulles, during this "trip," from the day he set foot on the soil of the Middle East, was constantly met with angry opposition from the people of Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, India, Pakistan, Greece, etc. - Dulles called this "some hostile demonstrations."

Under the widespread opposition of the people of the Middle East, the U.S. plan to piece together a Middle East aggression group has suffered a miserable defeat. Dulles admitted in his speech: "The establishment of a Middle East defense organization is a matter for the future, not something that can be achieved immediately."

    杜勒斯承认他的阴谋活动遭到中东人民的普遍反对
    美国拼凑中东侵略集团计划已遭惨败
    【新华社三日讯】华盛顿消息：美国国务卿杜勒斯在中近东、南亚十二个国家的不受欢迎的所谓“调查事实旅行”，已于五月二十八日结束。他回到华盛顿后在六月一日向美国全国广播的演说承认：他的阴谋活动遭受到当地各国人民的普遍反对，美国一年多来竭力想拼凑的“中东司令部”计划已遭到惨败。
    杜勒斯的演说露骨地表示了美国对中近东和南亚的野心。他说，“现在是美国政府更为注意近东和南亚的迫切时机了。”因为，这些地区的民族解放运动正在蓬勃发展。而“近东在战略上有巨大的重要意义，它是欧洲、亚洲和非洲之间的桥梁。”同时，
    “这个地区有和我们（美国）福利有密切关系的重要资源——石油、锰、铬、云母及其他矿产。”杜勒斯透露，美国的计划就是在“共同安全”计划下，在这个地区“适当地”使用美元，以取得“丰富的酬报”。
    但是，为了进一步侵入中近东，就必须把长期以来在这个地区占优势地位的英国排挤出去。关于这
    一点，杜勒斯在谈到埃及和苏彝士基地问题时最为露骨。他说，他和埃及独裁者纳吉布商谈了形势。杜勒斯认为，关于苏彝士运河基地问题，“问题的中心不在于英国军队的留驻”，“问题在于以后对这个巨型基地、它的飞机场和它的供应站的权力与管理。”他说：“这个问题的重要性超过了埃及的范围”，“美国愿意用任何合适的方式予以协助”。这是典型的美国插足中近东的阴谋手段。
    但是，整个中近东和南亚各国人民看清楚了美国的各种阴谋。杜勒斯在他的演说的结论中承认：
    “近东和东亚的大多数人民都深切地关心他们自己和其他人民的政治独立。他们怀疑殖民国家。美国也在被怀疑之列。”大家知道，杜勒斯在这一次“旅行”中，自从他踏上中东的土地那一天起，便不断地受到埃及、以色列、外约旦、黎巴嫩、印度、巴基斯坦、希腊等国人民的愤怒反对——杜勒斯把这称之为“一些敌意的示威游行”。
    在中东人民普遍反对下，美国拼凑中东侵略集团的计划已遭到惨败。杜勒斯在演说中承认：“建立中东防御组织一事是将来的事，而不是马上可实现的事。”
