Xinjiang's First Modern Irrigation Project
Hongyanchi Reservoir Completed

Xinjiang Province's first modern water conservancy irrigation project, the Hongyanchi Reservoir, was completed at the end of February this year after two and a half years of construction by troops and civilian laborers with investment and assistance from the Central People's Government. Water was released on April 26th. The reservoir currently holds nearly 50 million cubic meters of water, capable of irrigating 160,000 mu of farmland.

The entire Hongyanchi Reservoir project is divided into three major parts: The first part is the water intake system, the main component of which is a 5.5-kilometer-long water diversion canal from the Urumqi River to Hongyanchi. At the end of the canal, there are intake gates, sediment discharge gates, flood intake gates, and flood control gates. The second part is the water discharge system, mainly the low gate and high gate projects. The low gate project is 140 meters long and 16 meters high, including a culvert 180 meters long. The third part is the water transmission and irrigation system, mainly a canal from the Hongyanchi Reservoir to Qinggeda Lake, namely the Heping Canal, which is 30 kilometers long. Hongyanchi is located six kilometers south of Dihua City, surrounded by mountains on three sides. Together with the high and low gates on both sides, it forms a large reservoir with an area of ​​five square kilometers, storing the water of the Urumqi River and the summer floods, allowing it to flow along the Heping Canal into the Qinggeda Lake reclamation area, irrigating the dry Gobi Desert west of Dihua.

Since the Hongyanchi Reservoir project started construction in September 1950, a total of approximately one million civilian laborers and People's Liberation Army soldiers have participated in the construction. They painstakingly studied and overcame various difficulties, finally successfully completing the task. The entire construction project used more than 2,000 tons of cement, more than 15,000 tons of substitute cement, nearly 200,000 cubic meters of rubble, and more than ten tons of steel. The Central People's Government invested a total of more than 83 billion yuan in this project, helping to solve various difficulties in the construction.

    新疆第一座现代化灌溉工程
    红雁池蓄水库完工
    新疆省第一座现代化水利灌溉工程——红雁池蓄水库，在中央人民政府投资扶助下，经过部队、民工二年半的修建，于今年二月底完工，四月二十六日开始放水。该水库目前蓄水量近五千万立方，能灌溉农田十六万亩。
    红雁池蓄水库的整个工程共分三大部分：第一部分是进水系统，其中主要的是从乌鲁木齐河到红雁池开一条五公里半长的引水渠，渠端并修有进水闸、排沙闸、进洪闸、防洪闸等。第二部分是放水系统，主要是低闸门和高闸门工程，低闸门工程长一百四十公尺、高十六公尺，其中还包括一百八十公尺长的一个涵洞。第三部分是输水灌溉系统，主要是由红雁池蓄水库修一条通到青格达湖的水渠，即和平渠，共长三十公里。红雁池在迪化市以南六公里，三面环山，加上两边高闸和低闸，形成一个五平方公里面积的大蓄水库，蓄存乌鲁木齐河河水和夏季的洪水，使之沿着和平渠流入青格达湖垦区，灌溉迪化以西的干枯戈壁。
    红雁池蓄水库工程从一九五○年九月开始修建以来，前后参加修建工程的约共有一百万民工和人民解放军。他们苦心钻研，克服了种种困难，终于胜利完成任务。全部修建工程共用二千多吨水泥，一万五千多吨代水泥，近二十万立方块石，十多吨钢筋。中央人民政府在这一工程上共投资八百三十多亿，帮助解决了工程修建中各种困难问题。
