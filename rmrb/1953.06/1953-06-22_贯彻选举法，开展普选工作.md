Gansu Provincial Election Committee Decides to Change the Timing of Basic-Level Elections

The Gansu Provincial Election Committee held its fourth meeting on June 6 and approved the "Instructions on Changing the Timing and Steps of Basic-Level Elections in the Province to Ensure Production and Disaster Relief." The instructions pointed out that in order to ensure that disaster-stricken areas can concentrate all their efforts on production and disaster relief, and that non-disaster-stricken areas can carry out sowing, summer harvesting, and autumn harvesting in a timely manner without missing the farming season, the Central Election Committee has approved an appropriate postponement of the timing of basic-level elections throughout Gansu Province, with slight changes in the election steps. In areas where the summer harvest is late (spring wheat areas), the election may begin around June 15. If the first stage cannot be fully completed before the summer harvest, the nomination of representative candidates may be completed first. Election work will be suspended during the summer harvest, and the election work teams should immediately assume the tasks of production work teams, leading the masses to concentrate on harvesting. The election meeting will be held after the summer harvest to complete the election work. In areas where the summer harvest is early (winter wheat areas), election work will not be carried out before the summer harvest. Counties with severely disaster-stricken villages should focus on production and disaster relief, and their election work should be postponed until after the autumn harvest. At the meeting, Zhang Desheng, chairman of the Gansu Provincial Election Committee, gave instructions on the publicity and education work for the general election. He pointed out that the general election must be subordinate to production, and in disaster areas, it must be subordinate to production and disaster relief. The election work teams must also effectively assume the responsibilities of production work teams. Therefore, the general election publicity should also be closely integrated with production and disaster relief, and should not be carried out in isolation. The content of the publicity must be correct, simple, and clear. After one issue is explained clearly, another issue should be addressed, without trying to do too much too quickly. Publicity should be targeted at the masses' ideological situation, be deeply rooted in the people's hearts, eliminate the masses' concerns, and raise awareness. The publicity methods should be tailored to local conditions and effective measures should be adopted to maximize the universality and depth of the general election publicity and education work, and to play its due role.

Xinghua County, Jiangsu Province, Yan Jia Township Carries Out General Election Pilot Work in Conjunction with Production and Disaster Relief

On May 26, the Xinghua County Election Committee's pilot work team arrived in Yan Jia Township, Li Jian District, and convened a meeting of all township cadres to understand the basic situation of production and disaster relief in various villages. It was found that the summer planting of one-season rice fields had been completed, and the masses had a wait-for-rain mentality regarding drought resistance and prevention. A small number of disaster-stricken households lacked means for production self-rescue and had difficulties in life, with a reliance on government relief. Most of the masses did not understand what the general election was all about, and a few who knew something about it also held an "it's not my business" attitude. Township cadres were worried that the entire pilot work, which was expected to last forty days, would affect production.

After studying these situations, the work team made it clear that this general election must be centered on production and disaster relief and be closely integrated with it. This unified the the thinking of the township cadres and dispelled their concerns. At the same time, the team specifically studied methods for carrying out elections in conjunction with production and disaster relief, and unified work arrangements. The work team and township cadres made specific divisions of labor.

The next day, the township convened a joint meeting of party members, youth league members, propagandists, village cadres, and mutual aid team leaders. The work team assisted the township leadership in making a preliminary summary of the previous period's production and disaster relief work, pointing out existing problems and the specific tasks of the current production and disaster relief work. At the same time, it comprehensively explained the significance and purpose of the general election and the steps of the pilot work, emphasizing that all cadres should improve their work style and greet the general election while further leading the masses in doing a good job in production and disaster relief. The meeting also announced the establishment of the township election committee.

After training, the propagandists, together with the comrades of the work team and village cadres, went deep into the natural villages and mutual aid groups, focusing on solving the production difficulties and drought resistance problems of households in difficulty, and began to formulate summer production plans, combined with general election publicity. For example, in the mutual aid team of Zhou Yong Sheng in Houjia Village, there were many paddy fields, but only two waterwheels, and many fields were dehydrated. The cadres persuaded the team members to overcome the wait-for-rain mentality, and at the same time specifically helped the team adjust its labor force and adopt the method of rotating shifts to draw water without stopping the waterwheel. As a result, not even one mu of land was affected by the drought. Sixteen households in difficulty in Paifang Village had difficulties in life. In addition to helping Wang Zhaoxiang, Liu Jinzhi, and others to borrow boats to transport bricks and organize fishing for production self-rescue, village cadres such as Liu Jinkang helped nine disaster-stricken households borrow fourteen dan of rice and two dan of wheat to solve their living difficulties. In mobilizing the masses to further improve production and disaster relief, cadres and propagandists carried out publicity activities during the breaks in production. In this way, the production and living difficulties of the masses were initially solved, and they understood the relationship between the general election and production and construction. Their enthusiasm for production was greatly increased. Within a few days, 90% of the paddy fields in Paifang Village had been weeded, and four mutual aid teams had formulated summer production plans.

After receiving general election education, the village cadres also actively changed their style and improved their leadership. Liu Lushi in Paifang Village had no labor force and could not resist the drought. Village head Liu Jintian discovered this situation and immediately mobilized Liu Jinchen and other households to repair the waterwheel and draw water in time, so that 29 mu of land belonging to Liu Lushi and other households were not affected by the drought, which was well received by the masses.

At present, the whole township is further mobilizing the masses to resist drought and rush to plant, combined with population investigation and voter registration. (According to Nanjing Xinhua Daily)

Fuyang Changshan Township Relies on Village Cadres and the Masses to Solve the Contradiction Between General Election and Production

In the pilot work of the general election in Changshan Township, Fuyang County, Zhejiang Province, the general election work has been smoothly carried out because it relies on village cadres and the masses to solve the most pressing problems in current production, such as rushing to harvest spring flowers and transplanting rice seedlings. Now the township has completed the population survey and voter registration, and is preparing to nominate candidates and prepare for the election of township people's representatives.

When the general election work team arrived in the township on May 11, it was the season when the farmers in Changshan Township were busy with the summer harvest and planting. The township cadres and the masses were worried, thinking that the general election would definitely delay production. In this situation, the work team conducted three days of study to clarify to each cadre the principle that the general election must be combined with the current production tasks to be done well. And it was determined that the work team must go deep into the mutual aid groups, starting from helping farmers produce and setting production plans, to carry out the publicity of the significance of the general election. Subsequently, meetings of all communist party members and youth league members in the township and joint meetings of village cadres were held in succession, to dispel their thinking that there would be conflicts between the general election and production. The township and village cadres first dispelled their concerns and improved their confidence. Then they publicized to the masses through them. At the same time, the work team explained to the farmers the steps and requirements for carrying out the general election work in the township, and mobilized the farmers to discuss the methods of not delaying production themselves. After understanding these intentions, the farmers were in high spirits. They discussed and arranged the time and working methods for the general election and production in a very detailed way: 1. Change the original mutual aid group scoring at night to scoring in the fields; 2. Change ordering a production plan once a day to ordering a production plan for three days at a time; 3. Arrive at the meeting on time in the evening; 4. Stipulate the system of village cadres meeting to solve problems at any time, and reduce the number and time of large meetings; 5. Mobilize neighbors to chat and adopt flexible ways to carry out publicity. In this way, time was freed up in the evening for general election publicity work. In the process of carrying out population investigation and voter registration, in order not to delay production, preparations were made in advance, and farmers who were working alone were absorbed to participate in mutual aid groups, and paper strips for registration items were prepared and registered in the arranged order. During registration, the method of registering and publicizing at the same time was adopted. In individual remote and desolate villages, registration personnel brought registration forms and voter certificates to the villages, which were welcomed by the masses.

In the pilot work of the general election in Changshan Township, because many effective methods that did not delay production were adopted, not only did the township's summer harvest and planting not be delayed, but also the production tasks were successfully completed. As of May 28, the township had harvested 3,229 mu of spring flowers, accounting for 70% of all spring flower fields. 3,764 mu of rice seedlings have been transplanted, accounting for 80% of all rice fields. At the same time, most farmers have realized the important significance of the general election and attached great importance to their electoral rights. The township's population survey and voter registration work were successfully completed.

Feixi County Two Townships Complete Basic-Level Election Work

Shanxi Township and Guanyi Township in Feixi County, Anhui Province, the pilot townships for basic-level elections, have completed the basic-level election work. The two townships have successively convened the first township people's congress. The township head, deputy township head, and government committee members were elected, and the township people's government was officially established.

All constituencies have deeply mobilized the masses, and voters have enthusiastically participated in the election. The number of voters participating in the election in Shanxi Township averaged more than 87% of the total number of voters. In Huangdaying constituency of the township, 98% of the voters exercised their right to vote. Many voters regarded the election day as their grand festival, and many female voters even made new clothes to attend the election meeting.

Through serious elections, many outstanding people have been elected as township people's representatives and members of the township people's government.

Among the 31 people's representatives elected in Shanxi Township, there are nine communist party members and youth league members. Wang Yongzhen, a young female youth league member and a skilled worker on the production front, was honorably elected as the deputy township head of Guanyi Township. This poor peasant woman, who had previously served as a village and township women's representative, gained the trust of the broad masses due to her active leadership in the land reform, the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, and the resistance to U.S. aggression and aid to Korea. Many outstanding women were elected to the ranks of people's representatives, with female people's representatives accounting for 30% of the total number of people's representatives in Shanxi Township.

In the election work, the election committees of the two townships mobilized the masses to seriously and rigorously conduct the review of voter qualifications. Therefore, no citizen was wrongly deprived of the right to vote, nor was a reactionary element or a landlord class element who had not changed their status allowed to illegally steal the right to vote. Several former bandits who had been placed under control in Shanxi Township were able to abide by government decrees and actively participate in production after a long period of education and transformation. After discussion and approval by the masses, the township election committee approved the issuance of voter certificates. Some counter-revolutionary elements who had slipped through the net also carried out sabotage activities during the election process. After being reported by the masses, they were sentenced to control by the Feixi County People's Court and deprived of their civil rights.

Through the democratic education of this general election, the township and village cadres of the two townships have changed their work style. During the election process, the masses criticized the shortcomings in the work of the township and village cadres in the past, and the cadres also made profound self-criticism in front of the masses. Ma Chuanyou, the head of Guanyi Township, did not go deep enough into his work in the past and was not patient in solving problems for the masses. The voters criticized him. Now, Ma Chuanyou often goes to the countryside to solve problems for the masses, and his contact with the masses is closer.

Sichuan Suining Yufeng Township Holds First Township People's Congress After Completing General Election

Yufeng Township, Suining County, Sichuan Province, which recently completed the general election, has held the first township people's congress after the general election. The congress summarized the work of the previous township people's government, elected the new township people's government committee and township heads and deputy township heads, established the township people's government, and focused on discussing the future work of the township and made resolutions. Before the congress was held, the representatives respectively solicited the opinions of the masses in various villages on the previous township people's government and their future demands. According to the opinions of the masses, the congress focused on discussing the production issues that the people of the township were most concerned about. People's Representative Dai Haicheng, representing the mutual aid team he was in, proposed a plan to repair ponds to store water, which was resolved after discussion by everyone. The congress also decided that the new township people's government should focus on leading the masses to carry out drought resistance and water conservation in the next two months, and combine it with doing a good job in cotton topdressing, pest control, rice weeding and pest control. In order to further overcome the "five excesses" phenomenon in rural areas and not delay the production of the masses and cadres, the meeting decided to ensure that the township and village cadres who do not leave production should not spend less than 25 days a month in production.

After the congress, the representatives went to various villages to communicate the decisions on the same night. Because the resolutions of the congress fully met the requirements of the masses, the farmers kindly felt the benefits brought to them by the general election. In recent days, the farmers in the whole township have been actively implementing the resolutions of the congress with practical actions. On one day, the eighth village of the township organized more than 20 waterwheels to draw water and irrigate the fields. After People's Representative Dai Haicheng went back to communicate the resolutions of the township people's congress on the same night, he began to organize manpower to carry out pond repairs the next day. The enthusiasm of the masses for production is very high. (Xinhua News Agency)

    贯彻选举法，开展普选工作
    甘肃省选举委员会决定变更基层选举时间
    甘肃省选举委员会于六月六日举行第四次委员会议，讨论通过了：“为保证生产救灾变更全省基层选举时间与步骤的指示”。指示中指出，为了保证受灾地区目前得以集中全力进行生产救灾和非受灾地区的播种、夏收、秋收能够及时进行，不误农时，已经中央选举委员会批准，将甘肃全省基层选举的时间加以适当推迟，在选举的步骤上也略有变更。在夏收迟的地区（春麦地区），于六月十五日左右开始，如夏收前不能将第一阶段全部完成，可先完成代表候选人提名工作。夏收期间暂停选举，选举工作组应即负起生产工作组的任务，领导群众全力进行收割，待夏收过后再召开选举大会，完成选举工作；夏收早的地区（冬麦地区），夏收前暂不进行选举工作；各县遭灾较重的乡，目前应全力作好生产救灾工作，其选举工作应一律推迟到秋收后进行。会上，甘肃省选举委员会主席张德生就普选的宣传教育工作作了指示，指出普选必须服从生产，在灾区必须服从生产救灾，选举工作组要同时切实负起生产工作组的责任；因此，普选宣传也要密切结合生产救灾去进行，不能孤立地去宣传普选。宣传内容必须正确，力求简单明白，一个问题交代明白以后，再讲一个问题，不要贪多图快。宣传时要针对群众思想情况，深入人心，以消除群众顾虑，提高认识。宣传方式要切合当地实际，采取有效办法，使普选的宣传教育工作达到最大限度的普遍和深入，发挥应有的作用。（据甘肃日报消息）
    江苏兴化县严家乡结合生产救灾进行普选试办工作
    五月二十六日，江苏兴化县选举委员会典型试办工作组到达李健区严家乡，召开了全体乡干部会议，了解了各村生产救灾工作的基本情况是：一熟稻田的夏种已全部结束，群众对抗旱防旱工作存有等雨思想；少数受灾户对生产自救缺少办法，生活上有困难，有依赖政府救济的思想；大部分群众不了解普选是怎么一回事，少数人虽然知道一些，但也抱着“与我无关”的态度。乡干部听说整个试点工作要搞四十天，都怕影响生产，思想上有顾虑。
    工作组研究了这些情况后，明确指出这次普选必须以生产救灾为中心，紧密结合生产救灾来进行。使乡干部统一了认识，打消了顾虑。同时具体研究了进行生产救灾工作结合进行选举的办法，统一安排了工作，工作组和乡干部进行了具体的分工。
    次日，全乡召开了党员、团员、宣传员、乡村干部、互助组长联席会议，工作组协助乡的领导上初步总结了前一时期的生产救灾工作，指出了存在的问题和目前生产救灾工作的具体任务，同时全面讲解了普选的意义和目的、试点工作的步骤，强调所有干部要在进一步领导群众搞好生产救灾工作中改进工作作风，迎接普选。会上并宣布成立了乡选举委员会。
    宣传人员经过集训后，就同工作组同志和乡村干部一起深入到自然村和互助组，着重解决困难户的生产困难和抗旱问题，着手制订夏季生产计划，结合进行普选宣传。如侯家村周永生互助组里稻田很多，水车只有两部，有不少田已脱水。干部一面说服组员克服等雨思想，一面具体帮助这个组调剂劳动力，采取歇人不歇车的办法分班车水，结果一亩田也没有受干。牌坊村十六家困难户生活发生困难，干部除帮助王兆祥、刘进智等借船装运砖头和组织捉鱼等生产自救工作外，还有九家灾户由村干部刘进康等帮助借了十四石稻子、两石麦子，解决了生活困难。在发动群众进一步搞好生产救灾工作中，干部和宣传员利用生产空隙展开了宣传活动。这样，群众的生产和生活困难得到了初步的解决，并了解了普选对生产建设的关系，生产积极性大大提高，几天内，牌坊村有百分之九十的稻田薅了一遍草，四个互助组都订了夏季生产计划。
    乡村干部经过了普选教育后，也积极改变作风，改进了领导。牌坊村刘陆氏没有劳动力，无法抗旱，村长刘金田发现了这一情况，马上动员刘金臣等户修理好水车，及时戽水，使刘陆氏等户二十九亩田没有受干，群众反映很好。
    目前全乡正进一步发动群众抗旱抢种，结合进行人口调查和选民登记工作。（据南京新华日报讯）
    富阳长山乡依靠乡村干部和群众解决普选和生产的矛盾
    浙江省富阳县长山乡在进行普选典型试办工作中，由于依靠乡村干部和群众解决了当前生产最迫切的问题——抢收春花、插秧等工作，使普选工作顺利展开。现在该乡已完成了人口调查与选民登记工作，并正在酝酿候选人提名和准备选举乡人民代表。
    普选工作队在五月十一日到达该乡时，正是长山乡农民忙于夏收夏种的季节，该乡干部和群众的思想都存在着顾虑，认为普选一定要耽误生产。在这样情况下，工作队进行了三天的学习，使每个干部明确了普选必须与当前生产任务相结合才能做好的原则。并且确定了工作队必须深入互助组，从帮助农民生产订生产计划着手，进行普选意义的宣传。随后，又连续召开了全乡共产党员、青年团员的会议和村干部联席会议，打通他们认为普选和生产会发生矛盾的思想。使乡、村干部首先消除了顾虑，提高了信心。然后通过他们向群众宣传。同时，工作队又把在该乡进行普选工作的步骤与要求向农民讲明，发动农民自己讨论不误生产的办法。农民们在了解这些意图以后，情绪很高，他们很细致地讨论并安排了普选与生产的时间及工作方法：一、把原在晚上进行互助组评分改为在田间评分；二、将一天一次订生产计划改为一次订好三天的生产计划；三、晚上按时到会；四、规定村干部碰头会的制度，有问题随时解决，减少开大会的次数和时间；五、发动邻居漫谈，多采取灵活方式进行宣传。这样就腾出了晚上的时间进行普选宣传工作。在进行人口调查与选民登记工作时，为了不误生产也都事前作好准备，以互助组为单位吸收单干农民参加，拟好登记项目的纸条依照排列好的次序登记。在登记时采取边登记边宣传的办法。个别边远的荒僻小村，登记人员带了登记表、选民证送上村去，得到了群众的欢迎。
    长山乡在普选试办工作中，因为采取了许多不误生产的有效办法，因此不仅没有耽误该乡的夏收夏种，而且使生产任务顺利完成。到五月二十八日止，全乡已收割春花三千二百二十九亩，占全部春花田百分之七十。插秧三千七百六十四亩，占全部秧田百分之八十。同时，绝大部分农民对普选的重要意义也都有了认识，非常重视自己的选举权利。使该乡的人口调查和选民登记工作顺利完成。

    肥西县两个乡完成基层选举工作
    安徽省基层选举典型试办乡——肥西县山西乡和馆驿乡已经完成了基层选举工作。这两个乡先后召开了第一次乡人民代表大会。选举了乡长、副乡长和政府委员，正式成立了乡人民政府。
    各个选区都深入地发动了群众，选民热烈参加了选举。山西乡参加选举的选民平均达到选民总数的百分之八十七以上。该乡黄大郢选区百分之九十八的选民行使了他们的选举权利。许多选民都把选举这天看作是自己的盛大节日，不少女选民还赶做了新衣来参加选举大会。
    经过认真的选举，许多优秀的人物被选为乡人民代表和乡人民政府委员。
    山西乡当选的三十一个人民代表中有共产党员和青年团员九人。女青年团员、生产战线上的能手王永珍，光荣地当选为馆驿乡的副乡长。这位曾经任过村、乡妇女代表的贫农妇女，由于积极地领导群众进行了土地改革、镇压反革命运动以及抗美援朝等工作，获得了广大群众的信赖。许多优秀的妇女被选到人民代表的行列中来，山西乡女人民代表占到全体人民代表总数的百分之三十。
    在选举工作中，这两个乡的选举委员会都发动群众认真严肃地进行了选民资格的审查，因此，没有
    一个公民被错误地剥夺选举权利，也没有让一个反动分子或未经改变成分的地主阶级分子非法窃取选举权利。山西乡有几个被管制的曾经当过土匪的分子，由于经过较长时间的教育改造，已能够遵守政府法令，积极的参加生产，经过群众讨论通过，由乡选举委员会批准发给选民证。有的漏网的反革命分子，在选举过程中还进行破坏活动；经过群众检举后，已由肥西县人民法院判决予以管制，并剥夺了他的公民权利。
    这两个乡的乡、村干部经过这次普选的民主教育，转变了工作作风。在选举过程中，群众对过去乡、村干部工作中的缺点提出了批评，干部也都在群众面前作了深刻的检讨。馆驿乡乡长马传友过去工作不够深入，给群众解决问题不耐心，选民们向他提出了批评。现在，马传友经常下乡给群众解决问题，和群众的联系更加密切了。

    四川遂宁玉峰乡完成普选后举行第一次乡人民代表大会
    最近完成普选的四川省遂宁县玉峰乡已举行了普选后的第一次乡人民代表大会。大会总结了上届乡人民政府的工作，选出了新的乡人民政府委员会和正、副乡长，成立了乡人民政府，并着重讨论了全乡今后的工作，作出了决议。大会召开前，代表们分别在各村征求了群众对上届乡人民政府的意见和今后的要求。大会根据群众的意见，着重讨论了全乡人民最关心的生产问题。人民代表戴海成代表他所在的互助组提出修塘蓄水计划，经大家讨论后，作出了决议。大会并决定新的乡人民政府在今后两个月中，应以领导群众进行抗旱保水为主要工作，并结合搞好棉花追肥、治虫和水稻薅秧、治虫等工作。为进一步克服农村中的“五多”现象，不耽误群众和干部的生产，会议决定要保证不脱离生产的乡、村干部，每月生产时间不能少于二十五天。
    大会结束后，各代表当天晚上就分头在各村进行传达。由于大会的决议完全符合群众的要求，农民们都亲切地体会到普选所带给他们的好处。近几天来，全乡农民正以实际行动积极地实现大会的决议。该乡第八村在一天内就组织了二十多架水车车水浇田；人民代表戴海成当晚回去传达了乡人民代表大会的决议后，第二天就开始组织人力，进行修塘工作，群众生产情绪非常高涨。（新华社）
