Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, June 2nd. On the eve of International Children's Day, representatives of our diplomatic mission in the German Democratic Republic visited Korean children living and studying in the German Democratic Republic.

　　In the "Käthe Kollwitz" Children's Home in Moritzburg, near Dresden, live two hundred Korean children aged twelve to seventeen. Most of their parents were either sacrificed on the Korean front or bombed to death in the barbaric bombings of the American aggressors. As in other people's democratic countries, they have found their second home in the German Democratic Republic.

　　The Moritzburg Children's Home is located in a scenic riverside area upstream of the Elbe River, occupying an area of ​​20 hectares, and houses dormitories, classrooms, restaurants, clinics and gymnasiums for boys and girls. At the entrance are decorated the national emblems of Germany, the Soviet Union, and Korea, with the phrase: "Long live the friendship with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea!"

　　These Korean children have been sent here for upbringing for three months. They receive cordial care and protection here, and receive formal education. Four Korean teachers teach them Korean, and eight German teachers teach other courses. A total of 100 German staff members work at the Moritzburg Children's Home, 15 of whom are nurses. The children receive meticulous care, and they can also eat hometown food such as rice.

　　The person in charge of the Moritzburg Children's Home believes that "these children are lovely and well-disciplined."

　　When receiving the gifts presented by the personnel of our diplomatic mission, these Korean children sang songs of Korea and China together, expressing their gratitude to their Chinese uncles who have inseparable fighting friendship with them.

    我驻德外交使团代表
    慰问在民主德国的朝鲜孤儿
    【新华社柏林二日电】在国际儿童节前夕，我国驻德意志民主共和国外交使团派遣代表前往慰问在民主德国居住和学习的朝鲜儿童。
    在德累斯顿附近的莫里茨堡的“凯特·柯维茨”儿童之家里面，住着两百个十二岁到十七岁的朝鲜儿童。他们的父母大多数都是在朝鲜前线牺牲的或在美国侵略者的野蛮轰炸中被炸死的。如同在其他人民民主国家的情形一样，他们在德意志民主共和国有了他们的第二个家。
    莫里茨堡儿童之家位于易北河上游一个风景幽美的河岸地方，占面积二十公顷，里面建筑了男女孩子的宿舍、教室、餐厅、医疗所和体育馆。在进门的地方，装饰着德国、苏联和朝鲜的国徽，并写着这样一句话：“与朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的友谊万岁！”
    这些朝鲜儿童被送到这里来抚养已有三个月，他们在这里受到亲切的关怀和保护，并受到正规的教育。有四位朝鲜教员教他们朝鲜文，八位德国教员教其他的课程。在莫里茨堡儿童之家工作的德国工作人员一共有一百人，其中有十五人是护士。儿童们受到周到的照顾，他们还可以吃到像大米这类的家乡食物。
    莫里茨堡儿童之家的负责同志认为：“这些儿童都是可爱的和纪律良好的”。
    在领受我国外交使团人员所赠送的礼物的时候，这些朝鲜儿童一起唱起了朝鲜和中国的歌曲，表示他们对和他们有着血肉不可分的战斗友谊的中国叔伯们的谢意。
