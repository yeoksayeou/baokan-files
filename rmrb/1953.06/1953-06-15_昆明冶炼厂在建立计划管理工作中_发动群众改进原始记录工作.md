Kunming Smelting Plant Launches Mass Movement to Improve Original Records in Establishing Planned Management

The Kunming Smelting Plant focuses on ideological education for recorders and mobilizes workers to improve original record-keeping in the process of establishing planned management.

The plant's original records were already chaotic. In March of this year, a new batch of cadres was transferred to serve as original recorders. The leadership did not provide them with timely ideological education. They didn't understand production, weren't familiar with original records, and were emotionally unstable, so the original record-keeping became even more chaotic. To change this situation, the plant organized a study session for original recorders from various workshops and teams on April 27. The leadership focused on using specific examples of losses caused to production due to inaccurate original records in the past to educate everyone, inspire them to expose their thoughts, and eliminate ideological obstacles to doing a good job in the future. During the study, the recorders criticized many wrong ideas. Some said: in the past, they felt that working with numbers was "too monotonous" and "unpromising", and wanted to learn technology. At the same time, they were afraid that workers would laugh at them for just standing and making records, and that they were "not working." Therefore, most recorders often participated in labor with the workers, without seriously treating their own record-keeping work. Workers also actively criticized the previous belief in discussions that "raw materials and fuels are taken from the public and used by the public, so 'the wool comes from the sheep anyway', there is no need to record them", and "this is the business of the planning department, why push everything to the workshop workers? What is the planning department for?" etc. Furthermore, through analyzing the losses brought to the work by these wrong ideas, they gradually realized that doing a good job in original record-keeping is an important basis for accurately calculating costs and determining production targets. Thus, they consciously demanded to make records accurate and detailed. For example, the main problem in the smelting workshop is saving raw materials and fuels and increasing the recovery rate of copper smelting. In the past, due to incomplete original records, and failure to carefully weigh raw materials and fuels when requisitioning them, there was a strange phenomenon of feeding ten tons and four hundred kilograms of copper material into the furnace, but producing ten tons and eight hundred kilograms of copper after smelting. Thus, it was impossible to calculate the recovery rate. In the past, they did not weigh the coal they used, only estimating how many pounds they used. In the study, production team leader Zhao Zhixue said: "If we don't carefully weigh the raw materials and fuels we use, even if the original recorders record them carefully, it will be divorced from reality." From then on, everyone changed the past phenomenon of being unwilling to weigh when requisitioning raw materials and fuels.

    发动群众改进原始记录工作
    昆明冶炼厂在建立计划管理工作中着重对记录员进行思想教育，并发动工人做好原始记录工作。
    该厂原始记录原来就很混乱，今年三月份，又调来一批干部，担任原始记录员，领导上没有及时对他们进行思想教育，他们不懂生产，对原始记录不熟悉，情绪又不安定，所以原始记录工作更加混乱。为了改变这个状况，该厂于四月二十七日集中了各车间、小组的原始记录员组织学习。领导上着重用过去由于原始记录不准确，给生产造成损失的具体事例，向大家进行教育，启发大家暴露思想，扫除对搞好今后工作的思想障碍。记录员在学习中批判了许多错误思想，有的说：以前觉得搞点数目字“太单调”，“没出息”，想学技术，同时怕工人笑话自己只是站着做记录，“不爱劳动”。因此，大部分记录员，往往与工人在一起参加劳动，而没有认真对待本身的记录工作。工人们在讨论中，也主动批判了以前认为：“原、材、燃料是领在公家，用在公家，反正‘羊毛出在羊身上’，没有记的必要”、“这是计划科的事情，啥事都推给车间工人做，要计划科干啥？”等不正确的看法。并且，通过分析由于这些错误思想给工作带来的损失，逐渐明确了做好原始记录是精确计算成本、确定生产指标的重要依据。因而自觉要求把记录做得精确、详细。如熔炼车间的主要问题是节约原、材、燃料，提高炼铜的回收率。过去由于原始记录不健全，领用原、材、燃料时，也没有认真过秤，曾经发生过进炉十吨零四百公斤的铜料，经过冶炼后，反而出了十吨零八百公斤铜的奇怪现象，因而也就无法计算回收率。他们过去用的煤也不过秤只凭眼估，估多少斤算多少斤。在学习中生产小组长赵之学说：“如果我们用原、材、燃料不好好称称，就是原始记录员认真记了也是脱离实际的。”从此，大家都改变了过去领用原材燃料不愿称的现象。
