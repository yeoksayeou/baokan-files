Laizhou Special District Finance Committee of Shandong Province and Shaanxi Provincial Cooperative Union
Organize Work Teams to Go to the Countryside to Repair Waterwheels for Farmers

    During the promotion of waterwheels in 1952, many places paid little attention after selling and lending out waterwheels. Some farmers who borrowed waterwheels did not know how to use them, and some waterwheels were left idle. According to a survey of 13 counties in Laizhou Special District, only 56 percent of the waterwheels borrowed by farmers from 1949 to 1952 were actually used. Some waterwheels were not installed on wells at all.

    In order to enable farmers to use waterwheels well, the Laizhou Special District Finance Committee organized three waterwheel repair teams in May to work in various counties. The repair teams were composed of technicians from Longmao Iron Factory, Qiangguo Iron Factory, and Xinghua Iron Factory, which are affiliated with the Laizhou Industrial Company, and cooperative cadres. The Laizhou Special District Finance Committee also stipulated the following principles: 1. For waterwheels sold in various places that have problems due to poor quality and specifications and cannot be used, the original manufacturer shall be responsible for repairing them at no cost. If the problem is not due to product quality and specifications, but is caused by the farmers themselves, the factory can be responsible for the repair, and the farmers shall pay the repair fee according to the price. Farmers who have difficulty paying the repair fee can be supported by bank loans. 2. In order to ensure that farmers can use the waterwheels after they buy them, the cooperative unions in various counties must conduct on-site experiments when selling waterwheels in the future and teach farmers how to use them. If any problems are found on the spot, they should be repaired or replaced immediately, and it is strictly forbidden to push them out the door and ignore them. 3. The finance committees of all counties must attach importance to the lending and repair of waterwheels, mobilize and organize cooperative cadres to conduct in-depth inspections, and repair the damaged waterwheels in the hands of farmers in a timely manner.

    The Shaanxi Provincial Cooperative Union sent a waterwheel repair and fitting team to Sanyuan County on April 21. In a very short period of time, it repaired and fitted more than 300 Liberation-style waterwheels for the county. These waterwheels were originally installed with eight gears, which had a small water extraction volume, and some waterwheels were not suitable for local use. The workers of the repair and fitting team carefully studied the problem and found that the eight gears were changed to twelve gears, which greatly increased the water extraction volume, and some non-standard ones were also repaired. All repair costs were borne by the society and not by the farmers. In order to ensure that all the loaned waterwheels are flexible and easy to use, the Production Materials Supply Department of the Society recently sent another repair and fitting team to Weinan, Lintong and other places to carry out itinerant repairs.

    Making full use of waterwheels to ensure the smooth completion of summer planting is the urgent demand of the broad masses of farmers. The methods of dispatching work teams by relevant departments in Shandong and Shaanxi to repair waterwheels and guide the masses in using waterwheels can be imitated by various places.

    山东省莱阳专署财委会和陕西省合作社联合社
    组织工作组下乡替农民修理水车
    一九五二年推广水车时，有不少地方把水车销出和贷出以后，就很少过问了；有的农民贷了水车不会用，有些水车就闲起来了。据莱阳专署十三县的调查，自一九四九年到一九五二年，农民贷到的水车实际使用的仅占百分之五十六。有些水车根本没有安在井上。
    为了使农民能够把水车很好地使用起来，莱阳专署财委会于五月份组织了三个水车修理组，分赴各县工作。修理组由莱阳实业公司所属隆茂铁工厂、强国铁工厂、兴华铁工厂的技术人员和合作社干部共同组成。莱阳专署财委会并规定了以下几条原则：一、各地所推销的水车，凡因质量规格不好而发生毛病不能使用者，概由原制造厂无代价负责修理。如非因产品质量规格有毛病，而是被农民自己使坏者，可由工厂负责修理，农民按价付给修理费。付修理费有困难者，可由银行贷款扶持。二、为了保证农民把水车买回家后能够使用，各县合作社联合社在今后出售水车时，一定要作现场实验，教会农民使用。如当场发现水车有毛病，应立即进行修理或换新的，严禁推出门去不管。三、各县财委必须重视水车的贷放和修理工作，发动和组织合作社干部进行深入检查，把农民手里损坏不能使用的水车及时修理起来。
    陕西省合作社联合社于四月二十一日派了一个水车修配组到三原县，在很短时期内，给该县修配了三百多辆解放式水车。这些水车原先安装的是八齿轮，汲水量小，还有些水车不适合当地使用。修配组工人细心加以研究，找出了毛病，将八齿轮改为十二齿轮，汲水量就大得多了，有些不合规格的也给修理好了。所有修理费用，都不要农民负担。为了使所有贷出去的水车都灵活好使，该社生产资料供应经理部最近又派了一个修配组到渭南、临潼等地去巡回修理。
    使水车充分发挥效用，保证夏播工作的顺利完成，是当前农民群众的迫切要求。山东、陕西有关部门派出工作组修理水车并指导群众使用水车的办法，是各地都可以仿行的。（吴静方）
