    East China Administrative Committee Issues Directive to Conscientiously Rectify Statistical Reports
    The East China Administrative Committee recently issued a directive on conscientiously rectifying various statistical reports. The directive stated that due to the lack of serious research and regular inspection by many leading organs regarding the issuance of reports and the acquisition of data, many reports are divorced from reality and based solely on subjective demands, resulting in chaotic phenomena such as multiple leadership entities, each doing their own thing, numerous report formats, and mutual duplication. This not only increases the workload of many organs, especially at the grassroots level, affecting central tasks, but also hinders the normal conduct of survey and statistical work.
    The directive stated: In order to change the above situation and gradually bring statistical work onto the right track, in addition to strictly implementing the regulations of the State Statistical Bureau and completing the tasks assigned by the State Statistical Bureau on time, each region and department must also conscientiously rectify all statistical reports issued in the past, as one of the important measures to improve leadership style and overcome bureaucracy.
    Following this, the directive put forward the principles and methods for rectifying the reports. These principles and methods are: To rectify existing reports based on the principle of appropriately taking into account the needs of various business departments while implementing the national basic reports, the reports issued in the past should be handled separately: Those that must be retained or can be retained after modification and simplification should continue to be retained, and those that must be cancelled or can be cancelled should be resolutely cancelled. In order to correctly implement the reports issued and approved by the State Statistical Bureau, people's governments at all levels and various business departments should collect and study the reports issued by the central competent departments in the past that are still being implemented, and submit a list to the national statistical agency. East China-level organs report to the East China Statistics Bureau, and provincial (municipal) level and below organs report to the provincial (municipal) statistics bureau. If any reports are found that have not been approved by the State Statistical Bureau or are difficult to implement in the work, opinions should be put forward and submitted to the East China Statistics Bureau or the provincial (municipal) statistics bureau for reporting to the State Statistical Bureau for handling. East China-level organs (including central organs stationed in East China) and provincial (municipal) organs (including central and East China organs stationed in various provinces and cities) should apply for registration of self-issued reports and additional reports that are still intended to be continued to the government statistical departments at the same level before the end of June and July respectively, and the statistical bureaus at each level will jointly review and re-examine them together with the organs. If the application for registration is overdue, it will be treated as automatic cancellation. Before applying for registration, each organ should independently abolish reports that are not necessary to retain. For reports that are still intended to be retained, the responsible comrades of each organ should personally review them. In order to avoid disconnection in business, the reports that should be filled out by various organs during the rectification period will be temporarily implemented as before. In order to implement the unified and centralized report system and reduce the burden on the grassroots, people's governments and business departments at the special district level and below shall not issue regular statistical reports or additional reports other than forwarding reports from higher levels. The original reports issued by them shall be abolished successively within the time limit stipulated by the provincial (municipal) statistics bureau; those that need to be retained may be submitted to the provincial (municipal) competent department for submission to the provincial (municipal) statistics bureau for unified issuance.
    The directive finally stated: People's organizations at all levels should also conduct self-inspection and cleaning of various reports issued by them in accordance with the provisions of this directive, and report the inspection results to the government statistical departments at the same level for consultation and handling. After the statistical reports of the organs at all levels have been rectified, if new reports need to be issued, they should be handled in accordance with the regulations of the State Statistical Bureau.

    华东行政委员会发出指示
    切实整理统计报表
    华东行政委员会最近发出关于切实整理各项统计报表的指示。这个指示说：由于不少领导机关对发报表、索取资料缺乏认真研究和经常检查，有很多报表脱离实际，只凭主观要求，以致产生领导多头、各搞一套、表式繁多、相互重复等混乱现象。这不仅增加了许多机关特别是基层单位的工作负担，影响了中心任务，而且也妨碍了正常的调查统计工作的进行。
    指示说：为了改变上述情况，使统计工作逐步纳入正轨，各地区、各部门除应严格执行国家统计局的规定，按时完成国家统计局所布置的任务外，目前还必须将过去所颁发的各项统计报表，加以切实整理，作为改进领导作风、克服官僚主义的重要措施之一。
    接着，这个指示提出了整理报表的原则和办法。这些原则和办法是：整理旧有报表，根据在贯彻执行国家基本报表的基础上，适当照顾各业务部门需要的原则，对过去颁发的报表分别处理：凡必须保留或经修改简化后可予保留的，应继续保留，凡必须取消或可以取消的应坚决取消。为了正确执行国家统计局颁发及批准的报表，各级人民政府、各业务部门应将中央各主管部门过去所颁发的现在仍继续执行的报表汇集研究，并开列清单报送国家统计机构。华东级机关报告华东统计局，省（市）级及其以下机关报送省（市）统计局。如发现有未经国家统计局批准或在工作中难以执行的报表，应提出意见，分别交由华东统计局或省（市）统计局汇报国家统计局处理。华东级机关（包括中央驻华东机关）、省（市）机关（包括中央、华东驻各省、市机关）应将仍拟继续执行的自颁报表及附加报表，分别于六月、七月底以前向同级政府统计部门申请登记，由各该级统计局会同各机关统一审查，重新检定。如逾期不申请登记，即作为自动废止处理。各机关在申请登记前，对无保留必要的报表，应自行废止，仍拟继续保留执行的报表，应由各该机关负责同志亲自审查。为了避免业务上的脱节，在整理期间各机关应填报的报表，暂时照旧执行。为贯彻报表制度的统一集中，减轻基层负担，专署级及其以下各级人民政府、各业务部门，除转发上级报表外，均不得自颁定期统计报表或附加报表。其原颁报表由省（市）统计局规定期限，陆续废止；有保留必要者，可提请省（市）主管部门转报省（市）统计局统一颁发。
    这个指示最后说：各级人民团体对所颁各种报表，也应照这个指示规定自行检查清理，并将检查结果报送同级政府统计部门会商处理。各级机关统计报表经整理后，如须颁发新报表，应遵照国家统计局规定办理。    （据解放日报讯）
