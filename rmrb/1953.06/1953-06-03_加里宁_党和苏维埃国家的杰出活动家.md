    Kalinin – An Outstanding Activist of the Party and the Soviet State
    Master of Historical Sciences of the Soviet Union A. Ovcharova
    June 3rd marks the seventh anniversary of the death of Mikhail Ivanovich Kalinin, an outstanding activist of the Communist Party and the Soviet state. His noble life is inseparable from the history of the Soviet Communist Party. Under the leadership of Lenin and Stalin, Kalinin participated in the establishment of the Russian Communist Party, actively participated in the preparation and execution of the Great October Socialist Revolution, and participated in the establishment and consolidation of the Soviet state.
    M.I. Kalinin was born on November 7, 1875, into a poor peasant family. In his early childhood, he had to serve a landlord. At the age of eighteen, this young man decided to leave the landlord and enter a factory. From 1893, he worked as a worker at the "Old Arsenal" in St. Petersburg, and two years later, he was a worker at the well-known Putilov factory. After finishing his heavy and long work almost every day, he went to adult night school and constantly carried out self-education. At night, he read revolutionary underground publications. This young proletarian realized from his own experience the difficult plight of the peasants and workers in Tsarist Russia. He decided to dedicate his entire life to defending the interests of the working people. Thus, Mikhail Ivanovich began secret revolutionary work and joined the Russian Social Democratic Labor Party (1898). He actively participated in the work of the "League of Struggle for the Emancipation of the Working Class" established by Lenin.
    In July 1899, Kalinin was arrested for revolutionary activities. This was his first arrest. By the time of the October Revolution, the Tsarist government had arrested Mikhail Ivanovich fourteen times, imprisoned him, and exiled him to remote areas. In 1900, Kalinin contacted the editorial department of Lenin's "Iskra" newspaper. He waged a fierce struggle against the Menshevik faction and supported Lenin's propositions on organizational and tactical issues. He was an excellent speaker, a talented propagandist and agitator. He established a number of Marxist groups, organized strikes and political demonstrations, and awakened and guided workers and peasants to fight against the Tsarist system. During the first Russian revolution in 1905, Mikhail Ivanovich was the leader of the Bolshevik organization at the Putilov factory. He launched an armed uprising of the Putilov people, established workers' volunteer teams in the factory, and led the entire factory in a sympathy strike for the rebellious workers in Moscow.
    In the February Revolution and on the eve of the subsequent October Revolution, Kalinin led a powerful strike movement in St. Petersburg, established and consolidated contact with the army, attended various meetings and rallies, and wrote articles for "Pravda" on issues such as political power, land, and peace. Kalinin was one of the leaders of the October armed uprising. Before Comrade Stalin returned from exile, V.M. Molotov and M.I. Kalinin led all the work of the Russian Central Bureau, the St. Petersburg Committee, and Pravda.
    In 1919, due to the death of Ya.M. Sverdlov, it was necessary to elect a new chairman of the All-Russian Central Executive Committee of the Soviet of Workers', Peasants', and Soldiers' Deputies. Lenin proposed Kalinin as a candidate. From then until his death, he always led the highest organ of the Soviet state and was continuously elected as a member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party, and from 1926, he was also elected as a member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee.
    Kalinin's activities in state affairs were multifaceted. He was an enthusiastic revolutionary and a brilliant builder of the socialist state. He linked the huge work of state management with the consistent and unremitting propaganda of Marxist-Leninist ideas. He tirelessly spoke to the broad working masses in the vivid language of the Communist Party. Even the most backward and illiterate peasant could have important issues of state affairs explained to him clearly and simply.
    Let us see how the Soviet writer Konstantin Fedin described Kalinin's speeches to workers and peasants:
    "I first heard Mikhail Ivanovich Kalinin's speech on the banks of the Volga River, in the city of Svisland, and the indelible impression his speech made on me astonished me for the first time. He was a uniquely gifted speaker: when he talked to people, he could touch the most hidden emotions with simple language and arouse the most precious hopes of mankind. With his gestures, with his humor, with his rage, he showed such confidence in the future that the audience willingly and joyfully accepted his ideas and feelings without feeling forced" ("Izvestia," June 5, 1946).
    In 1924, after the death of the wise leader of all nationalities, Lenin, the Communist Party waged a arduous struggle against the Trotskyist, Zinovievist, and Bukharinist factions, thereby defending Lenin's teachings and victoriously continuing the construction of socialism. In this struggle, under the leadership of Stalin, the core of the party's leadership was formed. Kalinin was also a member of this leadership core.
    Kalinin, who was initially a poor peasant and later a worker in St. Petersburg, made extremely valuable contributions to the cause of strengthening the firm worker-peasant alliance of the Soviet state. After the promulgation of the Land Law, which handed over the landlords', Tsarist, and monastery lands to the peasants, the Soviet countryside became more and more middle-peasantized. The middle peasants then constituted the majority of the agricultural population, and their importance rapidly increased. Mikhail Ivanovich tirelessly supported Lenin's slogan of reaching an agreement with the middle peasants and that the Soviet regime must be closely connected with the middle peasants.
    Kalinin actively fought for socialist construction. He thoroughly and resolutely implemented Stalin's ideas and instructions. Kalinin tirelessly explained to the peasants the necessity of transitioning from small-scale individual peasant economy to collective operation. He explained that national industrialization is a fundamental and decisive method to accelerate the improvement of the agricultural economy.
    Kalinin was a faithful friend of the working class. He supported the socialist competition of the workers with great concern. He called for the strictest thrift system, opposed waste and slackness, and called for the formulation of strict labor discipline and the improvement of labor productivity.
    Mikhail Ivanovich participated in the preparation and implementation of the Stalin Constitution. He presided over the Eighth Soviet Congress, which, after hearing the report of Stalin, the wise leader of the Soviet people, adopted the most democratic constitution in the world.
    Kalinin made great efforts in consolidating the friendship of all nationalities in the Soviet Union. In his speeches, he constantly pointed out that only by relying on the unbreakable and close friendship of all nationalities in the Soviet state could the Soviet Union achieve unprecedented achievements in the development of the national economy and culture:
    "The peasants have stood up, people have grown up, and leaders from the people have emerged in every nation - fighters for socialism...
    Despite the vast territory and the differences in culture and language, we are all a united working army that realizes the great ideas of the Communist Party."
    Kalinin tirelessly propagated the teachings of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin among the working people. He devoted most of his time to the cause of national education. Kalinin opposed mechanical memorization of theories, opposed chewing on dry dogmas, and opposed reading books blindly. He demanded in-depth study of theoretical issues and demanded that theoretical knowledge be applied in practice.
    Kalinin believed that cultivating Soviet patriotism, cultivating loyalty and love for the socialist motherland, was the most important thing in communist education. In the struggle of the Soviet people for the freedom and independence of all nationalities, the great patriot Mikhail Ivanovich made extremely valuable contributions. He tirelessly emphasized that a citizen of a socialist country would not isolate himself from the working people of the world and think only of himself, and that he would be deeply concerned about the situation of the working class and peasants outside the Soviet borders. During the years of the Great Patriotic War (1941-1945), despite suffering from serious illness, Kalinin still played a great role in mobilizing the Soviet people to use all their strength to counterattack the German fascist plunderers. He often went to factories, collective farms, and Soviet troops. He delivered speeches through radio and newspapers, calling on the Soviet people to devote all their activities to the struggle to defeat the enemy, drive the plunderers from the land of the motherland, and liberate the enslaved nationalities.
    Kalinin, a student of Lenin and a comrade-in-arms of Stalin, was a tireless fighter for peace and a propagandist for the friendship of all nationalities. "Please read the speeches of the Soviet representatives on the international stage, please analyze the resolutions reached by the Soviet government with other countries - they are always permeated with the policy of defending peace," M.I. Kalinin said in 1934, "No dark forces can hinder or conceal this extremely beneficial work from all nationalities."
    The Soviet people loved and respected Mikhail Ivanovich Kalinin.
    Ordinary Soviet people often wrote to Kalinin, expressing their love and respect for him, asking him for advice, and sometimes even asking him for help. But no letter was ever left unanswered. During the twenty-seven years that Kalinin worked in the high position of leader of the highest organ of the Soviet regime, he received more than four million letters, and he and his assistants received almost one million people. Any Soviet citizen could enter his reception room on Mokhov Street in Moscow without any hindrance.
    The Soviet people received the news of the death of M.I. Kalinin with deep sorrow. Because of his loyalty to the cause of Lenin and Stalin, because of his closeness to the masses and his deep understanding of their interests, and because of his tireless concern for the happiness of the people, he deserved the sincere respect and love of all working people.

    加里宁——党和苏维埃国家的杰出活动家
    苏联历史科学硕士  阿·奥伏察洛瓦
    六月三日是共产党和苏维埃国家的杰出活动家，米哈伊尔·伊凡诺维奇·加里宁的逝世七周年。他的高尚的生活，是和苏联共产党的历史分不开的。在列宁和斯大林的领导下，加里宁曾参与俄罗斯共产党的建立，曾积极地参加伟大十月社会主义革命的准备和进行参加苏维埃国家的建立和巩固的工作。
    米·伊·加里宁一八七五年十一月七日生于一个贫农的家中。早在童年时期，他就不得不去伺候一个地主。十八岁时，这位青年决定离开地主而进入工厂，从一八九三年起，他当了彼得堡“老兵工厂”的工人，而在二年之后，他又是知名的普提洛夫工厂的工人。差不多在每天作完那烦重而漫长的工作之后，他都去上成人夜校，始终不懈地进行着自我教育。夜间，他读些革命的地下出版物。这位年青的无产者，从他自身经验中认识到沙皇俄罗斯的农民和工人的艰苦的遭遇。他决定贡献全部生命以保卫劳动者的利益。于是米哈伊尔·伊凡诺维奇便进行秘密的革命工作，他加入了俄罗斯的社会民主工党（一八九八年）。他积极地参加列宁所建立的
    “工人阶级解放斗争协会”的工作。
    一八九九年七月间，加里宁由于革命的活动而被捕了。这是他的第一次被捕。到十月革命为止，沙皇政府总共曾逮捕过米哈伊尔·伊凡诺维奇十四次，曾把他关进监狱，曾把他流放到远地。一九○○年，加里宁和列宁的“火星”报编辑部取得了联系。他对孟什维克派进行了猛烈的斗争，拥护列宁关于组织及策略问题的各种主张。他是一个卓越的演说家，有才能的宣传家和鼓动家。他建立了若干马克思主义的小组，组织了罢工和政治的示威，他唤起并引导工人和农民去进行反沙皇制度的斗争。在一九○五年俄罗斯第一次革命期间，米哈伊尔·伊凡诺维奇是普提洛夫工厂布尔什维克组织的领导者，他发动普提洛夫人们举行武装起义，在工厂中建立起了工人义勇队，领导过全工厂对莫斯科起义工人的同情罢工。
    在二月革命以及随后十月革命的前夜，加里宁领导过彼得堡的强大的罢工运动，建立起并巩固着和军队方面的联系，出席各种会议和集会，给“真理报”撰写一些关于政权、土地及和平的论文。加里宁是十月武装起义的领导者之一，在斯大林同志从流放地回来之前，维·米·莫洛托夫和米·伊·加里宁曾领导过俄罗斯中央局、彼得堡委员会和真理报的全部工作。
    一九一九年，由于雅·米·斯维尔德洛夫逝世，需要选举工农兵代表苏维埃全俄罗斯中央执行委员会新主席，列宁提议加里宁为候选人。从这时起一直到他逝世，他始终领导着苏维埃国家的最高机关，并接连被选为共产党中央委员会的委员，而从一九二六年起，他还被选为中央委员会政治局的委员。
    加里宁在国事上的活动是多方面的。他是个热情的革命家和英明的社会主义国家建设者。他曾把巨大的国家管理工作和对马克思列宁主义思想始终不懈的宣传联结在一起，他用共产党的生动的语言不倦地和广大的劳动大众交谈。就是一个最落后的不大识字的农民，他也能够简单明了地把关于国事的重要问题给他解释得清楚。
    请看苏维埃作家康斯坦丁·费丁是怎样地描写加里宁对工人和农民们的演讲：
    “我曾在伏尔加岸上、绥自兰市内初次听到米哈伊尔·伊凡诺维奇·加里宁的讲话，他的讲话给人的那种难以泯灭的影响，使我第一次感到惊异。他是一个天生独具风格的演说家：他和人们交谈时，能用简单的语言触到那最隐秘的情感，并能激起人类的最珍贵的希望。他用自己的姿势，用自己的诙谐，用自己的盛怒，表现出了对未来的这样的信心，使得听众毫不觉得勉强而欢欣鼓舞地去接受他那种思想和感情”（一九四六年六月五日“消息报”）。
    一九二四年，在各民族的英明领袖列宁逝世之后，共产党曾对托洛茨基派、季诺维也夫派、布哈林派进行了艰苦的斗争，从而保卫了列宁的学说，并胜利地继续了社会主义的建设。在这一斗争中，在斯大林领导下，党的领导核心形成了。而加里宁也是构成这个领导核心的一员。
    加里宁起初是一个特别尔的农民，随后是一个彼得堡的工人，他在加强苏维埃国家的牢固的工农联盟这一事业上作了极其宝贵的贡献。在颁布了土地法，把地主的、沙皇的、僧院的土地交给农民之后，苏维埃乡村更加是中农化的了。中农于是构成了农业人口的大多数，而其重要性也就迅速提高。米哈伊尔·伊凡诺维奇始终不倦地拥护着列宁的关于和中农达成协议、关于苏维埃政权必须和中农密切接近的口号。
    加里宁曾非常积极地为社会主义建设而斗争，他彻底而坚决地去实现斯大林的思想和指示。加里宁从不倦怠地给农民讲解由小规模个体农民经济向集体经营形式过渡的必要。他说明，国家工业化是加速提高农业经济的一个根本的、具有决定意义的方法。
    加里宁是工人阶级的忠实的朋友。他很关切地支持工人的社会主义竞赛。他要求进行最严格的节约制度，反对浪费和懈怠，号召制定严格的劳动纪律，提高劳动生产率。
    米哈伊尔·伊凡诺维奇曾参与了斯大林宪法的准备工作及其实施。他主持过第八次苏维埃代表大会，这次会议在听取苏维埃人民的英明领袖斯大林报告之后，通过了世界上最民主的宪法。
    加里宁在巩固苏联各民族的友谊上，尽过很大的力量。他在演讲中不断地指出，只是倚靠苏维埃国家的各民族之牢不可破的密切的友谊，苏联才在国民经济和文化的发展上获得了史无前例的成就：
    “农民挺起身来了，人们成长起来了，在每一民族中都出现了来自人民内部的领袖——争取社会主义的战士……
    尽管地域是如此辽阔，文化和语言是那样地不同，可是我们大家也还是统一的、实现伟大的共产党思想的一支劳动大军。
    加里宁永不疲倦地在劳动人民中间宣传马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的学说，他以大部分时间从事于整个的人民教育事业。加里宁反对机械地背诵理论，反对咀嚼枯燥的教条，反对死读书。他要求深入地研究理论问题，要求能够在实践中应用理论知识。
    加里宁认为培养苏维埃爱国主义，培养对社会主义祖国的忠诚和敬爱，是共产主义教育中最重要的事情。在苏维埃人民为各民族的自由和独立而进行的斗争中，伟大的爱国者米哈伊尔·伊凡诺维奇曾作出了极其宝贵的贡献。他不倦地强调着，一个社会主义国家的公民不会和全世界劳苦人们隔离开而想着他自己，苏维埃国境以外的工人阶级和农民们的情况是会使他深切地关心的。在伟大卫国战争的几年间（一九四一——一九四五年），尽管是害着重病，加里宁在动员苏维埃人民以一切力量反击德国法西斯掠夺者上，也还是发挥了很大的作用。他常常到工厂、集体农庄、苏军部队里去，他通过无线电和报刊来发表演说，号召苏维埃人们把全部活动投入战胜敌人的斗争中，从祖国土地上驱逐掠夺者、解放被奴役的各民族。
    列宁的学生，斯大林的战友加里宁，是一个不知疲倦的保卫和平的战士，是一个各民族友爱的宣传家。“请您把苏维埃代表在国际舞台上的演说辞读一遍看，请您把苏维埃政府同其他国家达成的决议分析一遍看，——其中始终都贯穿着保卫和平的方针，——这还是米·伊·加里宁在一九三四年时说的，——任何黑暗势力都不能阻挠或对各民族掩盖这极为有益的工作。”
    苏维埃人们对米哈伊尔·伊凡诺维奇·加里宁是热爱的和尊崇的。
    普通的苏维埃人们常给加里宁写信，表示他们对他的敬爱，向他请求忠告，而有时还要他帮助。可是从没有哪一封信得不到答复。加里宁在他身居苏维埃政权最高机关的崇高领袖地位而工作的二十七年间，接到过四百多万封信，他同他的助理人员接见过差不多一百万人。任何一个苏维埃的公民都能够通行无阻地到莫斯科莫霍夫街他那会客室里去。
    苏维埃人民曾以深切的悲痛承受了米·伊·加里宁逝世的消息，他，由于忠实于列宁、斯大林的事业，由于接近人民大众并深知他们的利益，由于不倦地关心人民的幸福，本是应得到一切劳动人民的衷心的尊敬与热爱的。（何封译）
