    Xinhua News Agency, Paris, June 19th: The French government crisis continued for the twenty-ninth day on the 18th. After Georges Bidault, the Radical Socialist André Marie requested authorization from the National Assembly to form a government. Like the several unsuccessful contenders before him, Marie also failed to obtain a majority vote in the National Assembly.
    Marie's speech when requesting authorization from the parliament showed that he was not prepared to change the disastrous policies that the French government had been implementing for years. He emphasized that the "basic principle" of his government would be to continue the alliance with the United States and Britain. He also stated that he would rely on American "aid" to continue the colonial war in Vietnam.
    In the early morning of the 19th, the parliament voted, with 272 votes in favor of authorizing Marie to form a cabinet and 209 votes against. Marie was far from obtaining the majority required by the constitution—314 votes.
    Marie is the fourth person in a row to fail to obtain authorization from the National Assembly to form a cabinet.

    法国政府危机延续中
    激进社会党人马里组阁失败
    【新华社十九日讯】巴黎消息：十八日是法国政府危机延续的第二十九天，激进社会党人安德烈·马里继乔治·皮杜尔之后，要求国民议会授权他出来组织政府。和在他前面的几个不成功的尝试者一样，马里也未得到国民议会过半数票。
    马里在要求议会授权时发表的演说表明：他并不准备改变法国政府几年来执行的祸国殃民的政策。他强调他的政府的“基本法则”将是继续和美、英两国联盟。他也表示将依靠美国的“援助”继续在越南的殖民战争。
    十九日清晨，议会投票，结果二百七十二票赞成授权马里组阁，二百零九票反对，马里远没有获得宪法所规定的多数票——三百一十四票。
    马里已是连续要求国民议会授权组阁失败的第四人。
