    The Heroic Struggle of the Korean People
    Han Xueye, Chairman of the Korean Literary and Art General Alliance

    Today, the Korean people are more closely united than ever before around their beloved leader, Marshal Kim Il-sung, and the Korean Workers' Party and the Republic's government he leads. In the fierce Fatherland Liberation War against the American and British aggressors and their running dogs, they have inscribed unparalleled heroic feats and unprecedented victories in their history, making it radiate with brilliant light and making their nation's honor shake the world.

    At the beginning of the Fatherland Liberation War, our beloved leader, Marshal Kim Il-sung, said: "No matter how the American imperialists use force to invade our country, they can never weaken the Korean people's will to fight for the freedom and independence of their fatherland and their heroic spirit. The Korean people, who have risen up to defend the sacred cause of their fatherland's honor, freedom, and independence, are determined to fight to the death against American imperialist aggression and must achieve final victory. ... The American imperialists will surely know how great and infinite the power of our Korean people is, and how firm is our indomitable will to fight for the freedom and independence of our fatherland."

    The entire course of the Korean people's Fatherland Liberation War has definitively proven that Marshal Kim Il-sung's prediction was correct.

    All the Korean people are infinitely loyal to the Korean Workers' Party and Marshal Kim Il-sung. They consider the freedom and independence of the glorious fatherland—the Democratic People's Republic of Korea—more precious than anything else. They resisted the armed aggression of the American imperialists, who boast of being the "most powerful" in the world capitalist system, selflessly annihilated and wiped out the enemy, and shattered the enemy's vicious invasion plans.

    As the facts have proven, our people, together with the heroic Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, with the strong support and solidarity of all peace-loving and democratic forces in the world, have displayed unparalleled courage and patriotic dedication in the three years of war, achieved historic victories in their just struggle, and made great achievements in the cause of defending world peace.

    American imperialism once thought it could easily turn the Korean people into its colonial slaves and turn our republic into its base for aggression. However, the enemy's illusions and foolish attempts were shattered by the heavy and powerful blows of the heroic Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers.

    The Korean people believe that their struggle is a just battle to defend the freedom, independence, and honor of their fatherland, a banner of national liberation for colonial peoples, and even a struggle at the forefront of defending world peace. With such a high degree of awareness and pride, and with boundless hatred and infinite anger towards the enemy, the Korean people have displayed heroism, dedication, and initiative in the struggle.

    The Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, in the three years of war, have annihilated a total of nearly one million enemy troops, including more than 380,000 American soldiers, destroyed and captured a large amount of combat equipment, and stabilized the front near the 38th parallel, where the enemy suddenly launched an offensive against the northern half in opposition to the Korean people. They then turned to an active positional defense, further severely hitting the enemy, and welcoming the days of victory.

    During this time, the enemy launched the so-called "Summer Offensive" and "Autumn Offensive," investing large numbers of troops and combat equipment. However, the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers shattered the enemy's attempts each time, causing the enemy to suffer a crushing defeat.

    Van Fleet, the former commander of the Eighth Army of the American invading forces, launched the so-called "Summer Offensive" in May 1951, concentrating 150,000 invading troops and more than 1,000 aircraft on the front lines to carry out the offensive. However, due to the stubborn counterattack of our joint forces, they lost more than 162,000 men.

    After suffering a disastrous defeat in the so-called "Summer Offensive," the enemy launched the so-called "Autumn Offensive," which Ridgway had boasted about in advance. The enemy invested four divisions of troops on a 20-kilometer-wide front, launching a frantic offensive for two months. However, they lost more than 80,000 men and were repelled.

    In the nearly two years of defensive warfare by our army, the American generals, in an attempt to break through our defense line, disregarded the enormous casualties of their soldiers. They used bullets to coerce and drive soldiers to carry out hopeless offensives. Just taking the battle centered on Height 1211, held by our troops, as an example, one can fully understand how insane the offensives of the American armed interventionists were.

    From January 1 to December 31, 1952, the enemy launched an average of 300 to 500 attacks on Height 1211 each month, and fired an average of 527,260 shells and 4,160 bombs on every square kilometer of ground. However, the enemy was never able to set foot on this height. The corpses of American mercenaries filled the gullies in front of the height. Therefore, the American armed aggressors called Height 1211, which they lost many troops in but were never able to occupy, "Heartbreak Ridge" or "Trap Valley."

    The largest offensive launched by the enemy in the past year, the "Kimhwa Offensive," was meticulously planned and prepared for three months, with the aim of cutting off our western front and central front. The enemy mobilized more than 50,000 troops, 17 field artillery batteries, and hundreds of aircraft on this front of less than four kilometers, and carried out a concentrated attack. However, in a month and a half of fighting, the enemy suffered more than 25,000 casualties, lost many aircraft and military equipment, and was beaten back by us.

    In the course of active defensive warfare, the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers continuously dealt heavy blows to the enemy, did not yield an inch of land to the enemy, and defended their heights like copper walls and iron bastions. They guarded "Our Height" for three days and nights. How did they defend it! Why did Songpo fall? Why were the rocks broken?................ In flames and ashes, in "graves" and hell, welcoming death and conquering death, comrades stood up heroically like legendary generals, waiting for orders to come down. Sparks, explosions, shouts of victory,... the enemy fell with moans, rolling down the hillside. The height stood tall like a giant! Here, the fantasies of Wall Street were shattered, here, the rapid hit of a bullet shattered the illusion of world domination; here, a bayonet fight unfolded, shaking with lightning-like blades, causing the White House to wail! Korean Heights! Heroic Heights! Sacred "Our Heights"! I wish you eternity, may you become a shining symbol of freedom and independence, welcoming generations of descendants! Forever standing, forever lasting!
        ——Zhao Jitian "Our Height"

    Our heroic People's Army thus defended our heights and the heights of our fatherland to the death in the raging flames.

    The reason why our People's Army was able to achieve such victories is because: they relied on advanced Stalinist Soviet military science and the outstanding strategic and tactical methods created by Marshal Kim Il-sung, displayed collective heroism based on the lofty patriotic spirit of proletarian internationalism, and achieved close contact with the Chinese People's Volunteers fighting shoulder to shoulder.

    In the course of this heroic struggle, more than 400 Republic heroes have been cultivated. Many Korean Matrosov-style heroes, headed by Kim Chang-je, blocked the enemy's firing points with their chests, preventing the troops from advancing. Zhao Yu-ji, the Korean Zoya who defended the fatherland, carried out guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines, and never surrendered until she was killed after being captured by the enemy. Like her, there have been many heroes who are full of infinite loyalty and dedication to the Party, the leader, and the government, and they continue to emerge. Hero Kim Seong-jin blocked the enemy's firing point spewing fire with his chest that infinitely loved the motherland. He did not sacrifice and continued to fire bullets to annihilate the enemy. His glorious deeds have become heroic deeds sung by people all over the world.

    These victories on the front lines include the results of the iron-like unity and dedicated labor struggles of the strong rear. In the fighting Korea, the rear is also the front. In the struggle in the rear, the exemplary and core role played by the most advanced revolutionary part of the Korean people—the Korean working class—occupies an important position.

    On the labor front in the rear, in the wartime production increase struggle to produce more bullets and an inch of cloth for the front, they are displaying a mass heroic spirit and establishing glorious labor achievements in step with the heroic spirit of the warriors on the front. Many workers threw down their hammers and picked up guns to join the People's Army in the early days of the war. Among them, 147 Republic heroes of worker origin emerged, led by Baek Sa-soon, a double hero of the Republic, and Kim Chang-je, a Korean Matrosov. In defending the rear, the Korean working class put forward the slogans "More," "Faster," "Better," and "More Economical," bravely overcame various difficulties, eliminated various obstacles, and rose up to carry out the wartime production increase struggle united as one.

    All the workers not only overfulfilled their production quotas, but also resolved to complete the original quotas of their comrades who had gone to the front. They launched various forms of production increase competition movements such as the "Front Assault Team Movement," the "Front Youth Work Class Movement," the "Multiple Machine Movement," and the "Cost Reduction Movement." In these solemn production increase competition movements, many labor heroes and production innovators emerged.

    In the mining sector, labor heroes Zhao Du-sil and Kim Chang-sun imitated advanced Soviet technology, improved old operating methods, and created the "new parallel blasting method" and the "stage mining method," establishing epoch-making ore extraction records and tunneling records. Female labor heroes Tang Yun-bin and Gao Yong-suk created the "two-stage silk thread turnover method" in textile production, successfully completing the goal of producing more than 100,000 meters of cloth in a year. Thirty-nine people have been awarded the title of "Labor Hero" for establishing such outstanding labor achievements; more than 6,700 workers have received national medals and awards for establishing achievements, of which 129 are recipients of the Labor Medal.

    Due to such labor struggles, the total industrial output in 1952 increased to 119 percent of that in 1951, and the volume of railway freight transport increased to 113 percent.

    Such a struggle model can also be seen in the vigorous struggle of the farmers who are firmly defending the rear and actively increasing grain production. The farmers followed the call of their beloved leader, Marshal Kim Il-sung, that "the struggle for grain is the struggle for the fatherland." Their conscious struggle to strive for more grain production cannot be stopped by any force. Although they lacked labor, lacked agricultural tools and fertilizers, and suffered from various bestial bombings by the enemy, they did not succumb. They adopted advanced farming methods, developed mutual assistance, and used more green manure, resulting in an increase in agricultural production in 1952 to 113 percent of that in 1951, that is, an increase of 340,000 tons compared to 1951, and an increase of 130,000 tons compared to 1948, the year with the highest agricultural output in our country.

    The farmers' struggle for increased production, combined with the multi-harvest movement launched throughout the country, has developed into a powerful struggle in which farmers connect the ridges of hoeing with the front lines.

    Female production increase farmer Yu Wan-yu and production increase farmers Yin Shi-hua and Jin Da-sik, who won the National Flag Medal and the Labor Medal, overcame various difficulties and achieved a bumper harvest. Jin Da-sik harvested 19 tons per chongbo. Yin Shi-hua harvested 17 tons per chongbo. Many farmers who created equally outstanding production records also received Labor Medals, National Flag Medals, etc., and were commended by the state.

    The above facts show that the heroic struggle of the Korean people, who have risen up for the freedom, independence, and strong unity of their fatherland, cannot be destroyed by any aggressive forces. The American imperialists made a great mistake in their estimate of launching a war of aggression against Korea. They did not estimate the superiority of our fatherland's people's democratic system and the fighting power of the Korean People's Army, did not estimate the strength of our fatherland's rear, and the Korean people's indomitable fighting spirit and heroic spirit. They still regarded the heroic Korean people as the Koreans of the Lee Dynasty era wearing gauze hats and riding donkeys.

    At the same time, the American imperialists did not estimate the weaknesses within their invading army, nor did they estimate that they would be subjected to the angry condemnation and cursing of progressive mankind all over the world, thus completely isolating themselves. The American imperialists' illusion of the "powerfulness" of their own strength and the miscalculation of underestimating the Korean people's strength have caused them to suffer various humiliations and be unable to escape the tragic fate in Korea today.

    On the Korean battlefield, the American imperialists lose an average of more than 10,000 soldiers and consume as much as 800,000 tons of huge materials every month. Therefore, even Taft, one of the famous reactionary leaders in the United States, had to admit the failure of the American imperialist war of aggression against Korea. He lamented: "The cost of this war will far exceed the benefits we can get there." Due to the prolongation of the Korean War and the enemy's repeated failures, the morale of the American imperialist mercenaries has been declining, and the weakening of combat effectiveness and political and moral corruption have reached an indescribable level. The heavy failure of the armed interventionists on the Korean battlefield has made the contradictions and frictions within the imperialist camp even more acute. The vassal states of the United States, which participated in the evil war due to the pressure of American imperialism, are willing to get rid of the Korean War in order to avoid bearing more obligations of aggression.

    At the same time, we clearly know that the discrimination and quarrels among the troops of various invading countries within the so-called United Nations forces are increasing, and the contradictions within them are further deepening. At the same time, anti-war sentiment within the United States is also gradually deepening.

    So, what is the source of the forever glorious battle achievements, mass heroism, and bold and brave spirit of the Korean people on the front lines, and the great labor achievements in the rear?

    The reason why the Korean people have been able to achieve victory in the three years of the Fatherland Liberation War is the result of the superiority of our fatherland's people's democratic system, and the result of the wise leadership of our wise leader and steel marshal Kim Il-sung.

    From the first day of the war, Marshal Kim Il-sung has used infinite energy and outstanding leadership ability to powerfully organize and mobilize all the people and the officers and soldiers of the People's Army to strive for victory in the war. The warriors on the front lines sing of the source of their infinite strength—Marshal Kim Il-sung—and bravely advance towards the enemy's firepower points. All the glorious victories achieved by the Korean people are closely linked with his noble name.

    Therefore, the Korean people dedicate the glory of the great achievements they have made to the leader. They are united like steel around their leader Marshal Kim Il-sung for the prosperity of the fatherland and the nation, entrust their destiny and all their hopes to the leader, and express infinite love and loyalty to the leader.

    In front of the heroically struggling Korean people is the Korean Workers' Party. The Korean Workers' Party is the mobilizer and organizer of victory for all the Korean people's struggle against American armed interventionists. The Korean Workers' Party undertakes all the arduous burdens of the Fatherland Liberation War and carries out the cause of the organizer for victory. It enables us to use all our strength and methods in the cause of annihilating the enemy. It unites all the Korean people under one goal and bravely advances to establish heroic feats.

    Korean Workers' Party members fight when they need to fight, bleed when they need to bleed, and are not afraid of sacrifice, infinitely loyal to the Party, the fatherland, and the leader in any position on the front lines and in the rear. They are completing their tasks.

    Marshal Kim Il-sung said: "The Korean people cannot but win. Because in the front ranks there is the Korean Workers' Party—it is a Lenin-Stalin-style party that absorbs the experience of various advanced revolutionary parties based on the genius of mankind—the teachings of Lenin and Stalin—in its activities."

    The warm support and solidarity of the people of the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and the people of various people's democratic countries for the heroic struggle of the Korean people has become a strong guarantee of our victory.

    From the beginning of our Fatherland Liberation War, the great Soviet people gave us sincere and selfless assistance. The bastion of world peace—the great Soviet Union—has consistently made sincere and tremendous efforts to stop the bloody war in Korea and to peacefully resolve the Korean issue, making it possible to resume the Korean armistice negotiations.

    In the period when our food situation was very difficult, the great Stalin sent a gift of 50,000 tons of flour, which further strengthened the Korean people's confidence in victory. In particular, Stalin's speech at the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union is the program and pointer for victory in the struggle of the Korean people who have risen up to fight for the freedom and independence of their fatherland.

    The 475 million great Chinese people directly assisted the Korean people with blood in the struggle against the common enemy, American imperialism.

    In the most difficult period in our fatherland, the great Chinese people directly dispatched volunteers composed of their outstanding children to the Korean front lines, and held high the banner of "Resisting America and Aiding Korea, Defending the Home and Defending the Country," and continued to give us great spiritual and material assistance.

    Today, the assistance given to the Korean people by the great Chinese people is a noble assistance based on the spirit of proletarian internationalism.

    Marshal Kim Il-sung once said: "The fact that the Chinese People's Volunteers support the Korean War is a new and glorious manifestation of the unwavering friendship and mutual assistance between democratic camp countries. It is a noble assistance from a strong country to a weak country on the basis of selflessness, equality, and mutual respect."

    The unity and friendship between comrades of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers are being strengthened in the battle to defeat the common enemy. Due to their heroic struggle, the American imperialists' attempt to occupy the whole of Korea has been completely defeated.

    The people of various brother countries, such as Poland, Romania, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Bulgaria, the German Democratic Republic, Albania, and the Mongolian People's Republic, are also actively and widely carrying out movements to assist the Korean people. They continue to send us large amounts of grain, clothing, shoes, socks, medicines, and other assistance materials.

    The Korean people are not isolated. The Korean people are conducting a just war with the enthusiastic support and solidarity of the people of all countries in the democratic camp headed by the Soviet people and the peace-loving people all over the world, so it is bound to win.

    The Korean armistice negotiations, which were resumed due to the suggestions of Marshal Kim Il-sung and Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai, have signed an agreement on the issue of repatriation of prisoners of war, which was the only obstacle to the armistice negotiations, under our consistent and sincere efforts. The day of the armistice is coming.

    Today, for the freedom, independence, and peaceful reunification of the fatherland, the Korean people are more strongly united than ever around their beloved leader Marshal Kim Il-sung and the Korean Workers' Party and the Republic's government. The Korean people are bravely advancing towards the road indicated by the leader—the road to victory.

    朝鲜人民的英勇斗争
    朝鲜文学艺术总同盟委员长　韩雪野
    今天，朝鲜人民，比任何时候都更加紧密地团结在敬爱的领袖金日成元帅和他领导的朝鲜劳动党、共和国政府的周围。他们在反对美英侵略者及其走狗们的激烈的祖国解放战争过程中，把无比英雄的伟大功勋和空前的胜利，记载在自己的历史上，使它放射出灿烂的光辉，让自己民族的荣誉震动全世界。
    在祖国解放战争初期，我们敬爱的领袖金日成元帅曾说过：“不管美帝国主义者怎样用武力来侵略我国，但它绝不能削弱朝鲜人民争取祖国自由独立的斗争意志与英雄气概。为保卫祖国的荣誉和自由独立的神圣事业而奋起的朝鲜人民，反对美帝国主义的侵略，誓死斗争，一定要取得最后胜利。……美帝国主义者一定会知道我们朝鲜人民的力量是何等的伟大、何等的无穷，为祖国自由独立的不屈不挠的斗争意志是何等的坚强。”
    朝鲜人民的祖国解放战争的全部过程，确凿地证明了金日成元帅的这个预见是正确的。
    全体朝鲜人民无限忠实于朝鲜劳动党和金日成元帅。他们认为光荣的祖国——朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的自由和独立比什么都宝贵。他们抗击在世界资本主义体系中自夸为“最强大”的美帝国主义的武装侵略，舍身地消灭和扫荡敌人，粉碎了敌人凶恶的侵略计划。
    如同事实所证明的一样，我们人民与英雄的人民军和中国人民志愿军一起，在全世界爱好和平民主力量的大力支持和声援下，在三年来的战争过程中发挥了无比勇敢和爱国献身的精神，在自己的正义斗争中取得了历史性的胜利，在保卫世界和平的事业中取得了巨大的成就。
    美帝国主义曾经以为能够很容易地变朝鲜人民为其殖民奴隶，变我们共和国为其侵略基地。但是，敌人的幻想和愚蠢的企图，被英雄的人民军和中国人民志愿军的沉重的有威力的打击所粉碎了。
    朝鲜人民认为，自己的斗争是保卫祖国的自由、独立和荣誉的正义的战斗，是殖民地民族解放的旗帜，甚至是在保卫世界和平的最前线的斗争。朝鲜人民以这样高度的自觉和自豪，怀着对敌人的无限敌忾和无比愤怒，在斗争中发挥了英勇、献身的精神和积极性。
    朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军，在三年来的战争中，歼灭了敌人的有生力量总共近一百万名，其中美军占三十八万余名，破坏和缴获了大量的战斗装备，使战线在敌人为反对朝鲜人民而对北半部突然发动进攻的三八线附近稳定了下来。他们并转为积极的阵地防御战，进一步严重地打击着敌人，迎接着胜利的日子。
    其间，敌人曾经发动了所谓“夏季攻势”与“秋季攻势”，投入了大批的兵力和战斗装备。但是，朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军部队每次都粉碎了敌人的企图，使敌人一败涂地。
    前美国侵略军第八军军长范佛里特在一九五一年五月发动了所谓“夏季攻势”，在前线集中了十五万名侵略军和一千多架飞机来从事进攻。但是，由于我军联合部队顽强的反击，他们损失了十六万二千余人。
    敌人在所谓“夏季攻势”中遭到惨败以后，又发动了李奇微在事前曾吹嘘过的所谓“秋季攻势”。敌人在二十公里宽的战线上投入了四个师的兵力，疯狂地进攻了两个来月。但是，他们损失了八万多人，被击退了。
    在我军将近两年的防御战中，美军的将军们为了企图突破我们的防线而不顾其士兵们的巨大伤亡。他们以枪弹胁迫和驱使士兵们进行没有把握的进攻。仅举我军部队据守的以一二一一高地为中心的一个地区的战斗为例，就可以充分地理解美国武装干涉者们的进攻是多么的疯狂。
    从一九五二年一月一日到十二月三十一日的一年中，敌人对一二一一高地每月平均进攻三百到五百次，对每一平方公里的地面平均投射了五十二万七千二百六十颗炮弹和四千一百六十颗炸弹。但是，敌人始终不能踏上这个高地。美国雇佣兵的尸体填满了高地前的山沟。因此美国武装侵略者把他们损失了很多兵力而始终不能占领的一二一一高地称为
    “伤心岭”或“陷阱谷”。
    敌人在过去一年中所发动的最大攻势“金化攻势”，是经过了三个月的周密计划和准备的，目的在于切断我们的西部战线和中部战线。敌人在这个不到四公里的战线上动员了五万名以上的兵力、十七个野战炮队和数百架飞机，进行了集中的攻击，但是敌人在一个半月的战斗中就伤亡了两万五千多人，损失了很多飞机和军事装备，并被我们打退了。
    朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军在积极的防御战过程中，不断沉重地打击敌人，没有把一寸土地让给敌人，铜墙铁壁般地坚守了自己的高地。他们扼守着“我们的高地”，已过了三昼夜。他们是怎样守卫的！为什么松坡都翻倒？为什么岩石都破碎？………………………在火焰和灰土中，在“坟墓”和地狱中，迎接着死灭并战胜着死灭，战友们像传说中的将军们一样，雄赳赳地站起，等待着命令的下来。火花、爆炸声、万岁声，……敌人哀鸣地倒下了，从山坡上滚落下去。高地像巨人似地巍然屹立！在这里粉碎了华尔街的妄想，在这里飞快的命中弹一响，打破了独霸世界的幻梦；在这里展开着白刃战，晃动着闪电般的刀刃，使白宫发出悲鸣！朝鲜的高地！英雄的高地！神圣的“我们的高地”！祝你天长地久万万年，愿你成为自由独立的光辉象征，迎接子孙万代！永远屹立，永远长存！
        ——赵基天“我们的高地”
    我们英雄的人民军就这样地在炽烈的火焰中死守着我们的高地、祖国的高地。
    我们人民军所以能获得这样的胜利，是由于：他们依据先进的斯大林苏维埃军事科学和由金日成元帅所创造的卓越的战略战术，发挥了基于无产阶级国际主义崇高的爱国主义精神的集体英雄主义，和中国人民志愿军紧密地并肩作战取得了密切的联系。
    在这种英雄的斗争过程中，已培养出四百多名共和国英雄。以金昌杰为首的许多朝鲜的马特洛索夫式的英雄们，以自己的胸膛挡住了阻碍部队进击的敌人的火力口。捍卫祖国的朝鲜的卓娅——赵玉姬，在敌后进行游击战，被敌人俘去后直到被害始终没有屈服。像她一样地对党、领袖和政府充满着无限忠诚和献身牺牲精神的英雄，已出现了很多，并在继续出现着。英雄金圣镇以自己无限热爱祖国的胸膛挡住了吐着火舌的敌人火力口。他没有牺牲，又向敌人发射着歼敌的枪弹。他的辉煌功勋，已成为全世界人民传颂的英雄事迹。
    在前线这样的胜利中，包括着坚强后方的钢铁般的团结和献身的劳动斗争的结果。在战斗着的朝鲜，后方也是前线。在后方的斗争中，朝鲜人民最先进的革命的部分——朝鲜工人阶级所起的模范和核心的作用，占着重要的地位。
    他们在后方的劳动战线上，在争取为前线多生产一粒子弹和一寸布的战时增产斗争中，发挥着群众性的英雄精神，以和前线勇士们的英雄精神相配合的步伐，建立着光辉的劳动功勋。许多工人在战争初期，丢下锤子拿起枪来参加了人民军。在他们中间，出现了以共和国双重英雄白士淳和朝鲜的马特洛索夫金昌杰为首的一百四十七名工人出身的共和国英雄。朝鲜工人阶级在捍卫后方的工作中，提出“更多”、“更快”、“更好”、“更节约”的口号，勇敢地克服各种难关，扫除各种障碍，团结得像一个人似地奋起进行着战时增产斗争。
    全体工人们不但超额完成着自己的生产定额，而且决心把已去前线的同志们原有的定额也加以完成。他们展开了“前线突击组运动”、“前线青年作业班运动”、“多机台运动”、“降低成本运动”等各种形式的增产竞赛运动。在这些庄严的增产竞赛运动中，涌现了很多的劳动英雄和生产革新者。
    在矿业部门中，劳动英雄赵斗实和金昌善仿效苏联的先进技术，改善旧的作业方法，创造了“新的平行式爆破法”和“阶段采掘法”，建立了划时期的落矿纪录和掘进纪录。女劳动英雄唐云宾、高永淑，在纺织生产中，创造了“丝条二阶段周转法”，胜利完成了一年生产十万多公尺布的目标。因建立了这样特出的劳动功勋而荣获“劳动英雄”称号的有三十九人；因建立了功勋而获得国家勋章和奖章的工人有六千七百多名，其中有一百二十九人是劳动勋章的获得者。
    由于这样的劳动斗争，一九五二年度工业的总生产量比一九五一年度增长到百分之一一九，铁路的货物运输量增长到百分之一一三。
    在牢固地捍卫着后方、积极地增产着粮食的农民的轰轰烈烈的斗争中，也可以看到这样的斗争模范。农民们遵循着敬爱的领袖金日成元帅“为粮食的斗争就是为祖国的斗争”的号召。他们为争取生产更多的粮食的自觉的斗争，是任何的力量都阻挡不住的。他们虽然缺乏劳动力，缺乏农具和肥料，并遭受着敌人野兽般的各种轰炸，但是他们并没有屈服。他们采用先进的农作法，展开互助，多用绿肥，结果使一九五二年度农产物的产量增长到一九五一年度的百分之一一三，即比一九五一年度增产了三十四万吨，比我国农产物产量最高的一年——一九四八年度增加了十三万吨。
    农民们这样的增产斗争与在全国各地展开的多收获运动结合起来，已发展成为农民把锄地的垄和前线连接的强有力的斗争。
    荣获国旗勋章和劳动勋章等的女增产农民俞万玉和增产农民尹时华、金大植，克服了种种困难，获得了丰收。金大植每町步收获了十九吨。尹时华每町步收获了十七吨。很多创造了同样出色的生产纪录的农民，也都获得了劳动勋章、国旗勋章等，受到了国家的表扬。
    以上所说的事实表明：为了自己祖国的自由、独立与前后方的坚强团结而奋起的朝鲜人民的英雄斗争，是任何侵略势力所摧毁不了的。美帝国主义者发动侵略朝鲜的战争，在估计上犯了极大的错误。他们没有估计到我们祖国的人民民主制度的优越性和朝鲜人民军的战斗力量，没有估计到我们祖国后方的力量和朝鲜人民的不屈斗志与英雄气概。他们把英雄的朝鲜人民还当作带着纱帽、骑着毛驴的李朝时代的朝鲜人。
    同时，美帝国主义者没有估计到他们侵略军队内部的弱点，也没有估计到他们会受到全世界进步人类愤怒的谴责和咒骂，从而使自己完全陷入孤立。美帝国主义者对于它自己的力量的“强大性”的幻觉和过低估计朝鲜人民力量的失算，使他们今天在朝鲜蒙受各种耻辱并摆脱不了悲惨的遭遇。
    美帝国主义者在朝鲜战场，平均每月要丧失一万多个士兵，消耗达八十万吨的庞大物资。因此，连美国著名的反动头子之一——塔夫脱也不得不承认美帝国主义侵朝战争的失败。他感叹说：“这个战争的代价将远超过我们在那里能够得到的好处。”由于朝鲜战争的长期化和敌人屡次的失败，在美帝国主义雇佣兵中士气已日益低落，战斗力的削弱和政治上与道德上的腐化达到了不可形容的程度。武装干涉者在朝鲜战场上的沉重失败，使帝国主义阵营内部的矛盾和磨擦变得更加尖锐了。由于美帝国主义的压力而参加罪恶的战争的美国的附庸国家，为了避免多担负侵略的义务而愿意摆脱朝鲜战争。
    同时，我们清楚地知道：所谓联合国军内的各侵略国家军队相互间的歧视和争吵在日益增长，它们内部的矛盾在进一步深刻化。同时，美国内部的反战情绪也在逐渐加深。
    那么，朝鲜人民在前线的永远光辉的战斗功勋，群众性的英雄主义和大胆、勇敢精神，以及在后方的伟大劳动功勋的源泉是什么呢？
    朝鲜人民在三年来的祖国解放战争中所以能取得胜利，是我们祖国的人民民主制度发挥了优越性的结果，是我们英明的领袖和钢铁的统帅金日成元帅贤明领导的结果。
    金日成元帅从战争的第一天起，就以无限的精力和卓越的领导才能，有力地组织、动员全体人民和人民军将士争取战争的胜利。前线的勇士们歌颂着自己无限力量的源泉——金日成元帅，在向着敌人的火力点勇敢地突进。朝鲜人民取得的一切光辉胜利都是和他高贵的名字密切地连在一起的。
    因此，朝鲜人民，将自己所建立的伟大业绩的光荣献于领袖。他们为了祖国和民族的繁荣而钢铁般地团结在自己的领袖金日成元帅的周围，将自己的命运和一切希望都托付给领袖，对领袖表示着无限的爱戴和忠诚。
    在英雄地斗争着的朝鲜人民前面，有着朝鲜劳动党。朝鲜劳动党是全朝鲜人民为反对美国武装干涉者的斗争的鼓动者和胜利的组织者。朝鲜劳动党担负着祖国解放战争的一切艰巨重担，进行着为争取胜利的组织者的事业。它使我们把一切力量和办法都用在消灭敌人的事业上。它使全体朝鲜人民团结在一个目标之下，为建立英雄的功勋勇猛挺进。
    朝鲜劳动党党员在前线和后方的任何岗位上，需要战斗时就去战斗，需要流血时就去流血，不怕牺牲，无限忠诚于党、祖国和领袖。他们在完成着自己的任务。
    金日成元帅说：“朝鲜人民是不能不胜利的。因为在他的前列有朝鲜劳动党——它是在自己的活动中吸收基于人类的天才——列宁、斯大林的学说的各先进的革命政党经验的列宁、斯大林型的党。”
    苏联、中华人民共和国和各人民民主国家人民，对朝鲜人民的英雄斗争热烈支持和声援，已成为我们胜利的坚强保障。
    我们祖国解放战争一开始，伟大的苏联人民就给了我们诚挚无私的援助。世界和平的堡垒——伟大的苏联，为了停止朝鲜的流血战争，为了和平解决朝鲜问题，一贯地作着真诚的和巨大的努力，使恢复朝鲜停战谈判有了可能。
    在我们的食粮情况非常困难的时期里，伟大的斯大林送来了五万吨面粉的礼物，使朝鲜人民更加坚定了胜利的信心。特别是斯大林在苏联共产党第十九次代表大会上所作的演说，它是为争取自己祖国的自由和独立而奋起的朝鲜人民的斗争的纲领和胜利的指针。
    四亿七千五百万伟大的中国人民，在反对共同敌人美帝国主义的斗争中，直接用鲜血援助了朝鲜人民。
    在我们祖国处在最艰难的时期里，伟大的中国人民把由自己的优秀儿女组成的志愿军直接派遣到朝鲜前线，并高举“抗美援朝，保家卫国”的旗帜，继续给予我们以精神上和物质上的大力援助。
    今天，伟大的中国人民给予朝鲜人民的援助，是基于无产阶级国际主义精神的高尚的援助。
    金日成元帅曾说过：“中国人民志愿军支援朝鲜战争这一事实，是民主阵营国家间坚贞不渝的友谊和互助的一种新的和辉煌的表现，这是在无私的、平等和互相尊敬的基础上，强国给予弱国的一种崇高的援助。”
    朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军部队战友的团结与友谊，在击败共同敌人的战斗中正愈见加强。由于他们的英雄斗争，美帝国主义侵占全部朝鲜的企图已经遭受到完全的失败。
    波兰、罗马尼亚、捷克斯洛伐克、匈牙利、保加利亚、德意志民主共和国、阿尔巴尼亚、蒙古人民共和国等各兄弟国家人民，也在积极地广泛地展开着援助朝鲜人民的运动。他们继续不断地给我们送来了大量的粮食、衣服、鞋袜、药品等援助物资。
    朝鲜人民不是孤立的，朝鲜人民在以苏联人民为首的民主阵营各国人民和全世界爱好和平人民的热烈支持和声援下，进行着的正义的战争，因此是一定要胜利的。
    由于金日成元帅和周恩来外交部长的建议而复会的朝鲜停战谈判，在我方始终如一的诚意努力之下，曾成为停战谈判唯一障碍的关于遣返战俘问题的协议，已经签字了。停战实现的日子将要到来了。
    今天，朝鲜人民为了祖国的自由、独立与和平统一，比任何时候都更加坚强地团结在敬爱的领袖金日成元帅和朝鲜劳动党及共和国政府的周围。朝鲜人民正勇敢地向着领袖所指示的道路——胜利的道路前进。
