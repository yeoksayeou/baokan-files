    Xinhua News Agency, June 6th: According to TASS, Moscow: The "Labor Daily" published an article on the 4th by N. Ivanov, entitled "New Type of International Economic Relations." The author said: Common goals and common laws governing economic development create very favorable conditions for expanding and strengthening cooperation among countries of the democratic camp. The decisive factor in this cooperation is the continuous and comprehensive assistance provided by the great Soviet Union to all people's democratic countries. This assistance has enabled the people's democratic countries to establish new industrial sectors with the latest equipment. In recent years, the latest machinery and equipment sent by the Soviet Union to the people's democratic countries have been increasing year by year. In 1952, Soviet exports of machinery and equipment to these countries increased tenfold compared to 1948. Thus, the Soviet Union has almost satisfied all fraternal countries' needs for machinery in basic industries, cotton, and many other commodities.
    The author said: Cooperation with the Soviet Union is an extremely important factor in the economic transition of all people's democratic countries towards socialism. All countries of the democratic camp are actively expanding and strengthening economic exchanges. For example, in 1937, trade among these countries accounted for only 12 percent of their foreign trade; but last year, this proportion had increased to 73 percent. The proportion of the Soviet Union and European people's democratic countries in China's foreign trade has increased from 26 percent in 1950 to 72 percent in 1952. With the conclusion of long-term economic agreements (which are possible due to the implementation of long-term plans in these countries), cooperation among the countries of the democratic camp has been further expanded.
    Among the forms of cooperation that promote the development of various countries are joint exploitation of mineral resources and mutual assistance in developing a certain industrial sector. In illustrating this cooperation, the author cited the agreement between Romania and Hungary on the establishment of a joint venture. This company will soon build a giant gas and chemical plant in Romania; and a chemical plant will be built in Hungary, which will be supplied with natural gas from Romania. In addition, the author cited the agreement between Romania and Hungary on connecting power systems and other similar agreements. The author then emphasized that the joint industrial and transportation companies established on the basis of complete equality are an important feature of the new economic relations among the countries of the democratic camp. The Soviet Union, China, Romania, Hungary, and Bulgaria have established such companies. The quantity of production and the term of product disposal of joint ventures are planned, mainly taking into account the needs of the national economy of the country where the joint venture's industrial enterprise is located.
    The author also talked about the role of loan agreements in the economic relations among countries of the democratic camp, as well as the principles on which technical assistance among free people is based. He said: The countries of the democratic camp selflessly exchange their technical achievements and scientific discoveries. The Soviet Union, with its great achievements and rich scientific and technological experience, plays a major role in this economic cooperation.
    The author concluded: The new type of socialist economic relations that has emerged among the countries of the democratic camp is of great international significance. This relationship proves that true international equality and friendly cooperation will promote the economic and cultural development of all countries and improve the well-being of the broad masses of the people.

    苏联不断地和全面地援助人民民主国家
    民主阵营国家经济合作日益加强
    【新华社六日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：“劳动报”四日发表了纳·伊凡诺夫写的一篇文章，题目是
    “新型的国际经济关系”。作者说：支配经济发展的共同目标和共同法则，为扩大和加强民主阵营各国之间的合作创造了非常有利的条件。在这个合作中起决定作用的因素，是伟大的苏联给所有人民民主国家的不断的和全面的帮助。这种帮助已使人民民主国家建立了有着最新式设备的新的工业部门。近年来苏联送到人民民主国家去的最新式的机器和设备，一年比一年增多，一九五二年苏联对这些国家输出的机器和设备，已增加为一九四八年的十倍。这样，苏联几乎满足了所有兄弟国家在基本工业的机器上、在棉花和其他许多商品上的需要。
    作者说：和苏联的合作是各人民民主国家的经济走向社会主义的一个极端重要的因素。民主阵营的所有国家正在积极地扩大和加强经济上的交流。例如，在一九三七年，当时这些国家之间的贸易在它们的对外贸易中所占的比例，只是百分之十二；但在去年，这个比例已增加到百分之七十三了。苏联和欧洲人民民主国家在中国对外贸易中的比例，已从一九五○年的百分之二十六，增加到一九五二年的百分之七十二。随着长期经济协定的缔结（这些协定之所以能够缔结是由于这些国家实施了长远的计划），民主阵营各国的合作已进一步扩大了。
    在促进各国发展的合作形式中，有共同开采矿藏和在发展某一工业部门时的互助。作者在举例说明这种合作时，举出了罗马尼亚和匈牙利关于成立一个联营公司的协定。这个公司不久将在罗马尼亚建立一个巨型煤气和化学工厂；将在匈牙利建立一个化学工厂，这个工厂的天然煤气将由罗马尼亚供给。此外，作者还举出了罗马尼亚和匈牙利关于连接动力系统的协定和其他类似的协定。作者接着强调说：在完全平等的基础上成立的联营工业公司和运输公司，是民主阵营各国之间新的经济关系中的一个重要特点。苏联和中国、罗马尼亚、匈牙利及保加利亚成立了这种公司。联营公司生产的数量和产品处置的期限是有计划的，这主要是考虑到联营公司工业企业所在国的国民经济的要求。
    作者还谈到了贷款协定在民主阵营各国经济关系中的作用，以及自由人民之间技术援助所根据的原则。他说：民主阵营各国大公无私地交流它们的技术成就和科学发现。有着巨大成就和丰富的科学和技术经验的苏联，在这种经济合作中起着主要的作用。
    作者最后写道：在民主阵营各国间所产生的这种新型的社会主义的经济关系，是有着巨大的国际意义的。这种关系证明，真正的国际平等和友好合作，将促进各国的经济和文化发展，并增进广大人民群众的福利。
