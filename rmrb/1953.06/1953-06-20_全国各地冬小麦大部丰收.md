Winter wheat has been mostly harvested successfully throughout the country this year.

The provinces with successful winter wheat harvests this year are: Shaanxi, Zhejiang, Fujian, Yunnan, Guizhou, Sichuan, Xikang, Hunan, Jiangxi, Guangxi, and Guangdong. The Nanzheng, Baoji, and Weinan special districts in Shaanxi Province increased production by 15 to 30 percent compared to last year. Zhejiang, Fujian, and Yunnan provinces all increased production by more than 10 percent compared to last year. Guizhou Province increased production by 20 percent compared to last year, and other provinces will also be able to complete their planned production increases.

After some areas in Henan, Anhui, Jiangsu, Shandong, Shanxi, Hebei, and Hubei provinces suffered from winter wheat disasters, the local Party and government leading organs immediately led farmers to water, fertilize, and control pests, vigorously strengthening field management work, which significantly reduced the losses of wheat. In Hubei Province, the main wheat-producing areas of Wuchang, Echeng, Songzi, and Mianyang all increased production by 20 to 30 percent compared to last year, and the total output of the province may exceed last year's level. The total winter wheat output in Shandong Province may also approach last year's level. Henan Province has an average harvest of 60 percent across the province, and non-disaster areas have increased production by 10 to 20 percent compared to last year. In Hebei Province, winter wheat in irrigated land has mostly had a successful harvest, with an average yield of about 78 jin per mu for irrigated and dry land, which is about 80 to 90 percent of a normal year. The harvest in other areas is estimated at 80 percent in Shanxi Province, and 65 percent in Jiangsu Province. In the Huaibei area of Anhui Province, the harvest is generally 40 percent, with better areas reaching 50 to 60 percent. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

    全国各地冬小麦大部丰收
    全国各地的冬小麦今年大部得到丰收。
    今年冬小麦丰收的省份是：陕西、浙江、福建、云南、贵州、四川、西康、湖南、江西、广西、广东。陕西省南郑、宝鸡、渭南等专区比去年增产一成半到三成。浙江、福建、云南三省都比去年增产一成以上。贵州省比去年增产二成，其他各省也都能完成预定的增产计划。
    河南、安徽、江苏、山东、山西、河北、湖北等省部分地区冬小麦受灾后，当地党、政领导机关立即领导农民浇水、施肥、治虫，大力加强田间管理工作，相当地减轻了麦子的损失。湖北省主要产麦区武昌、鄂城、松滋、沔阳都比去年增产二成到三成，全省总产量可超过去年水平。山东省冬小麦总产量也可接近去年水平。河南省全省平均有六成收，非灾区还比去年增产一成到二成。河北省水地冬小麦大部丰收，水地、旱地平均每亩收七十八斤左右，约为八、九成年景。其他山西省可收八成，江苏省收六成半。安徽省淮北地区一般有四成收，较好的有五、六成收。（据新华社讯）
