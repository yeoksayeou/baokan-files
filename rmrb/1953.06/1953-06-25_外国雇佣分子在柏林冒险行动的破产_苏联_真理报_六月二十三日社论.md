    The Bankruptcy of the Foreign Mercenary Adventure in Berlin
    --Soviet "Pravda" Editorial, June 23

    In recent days, public opinion in various countries has been shocked by news of the foreign mercenary adventure in Berlin and the provocative actions of the Syngman Rhee gang in South Korea. Undoubtedly, these events, occurring on two different continents, are inextricably linked. What we are seeing is the sinister conspiracy of the enemies of peace, the reactionary groups who fear peace, do not want peace, and try by every means to prevent the easing of international tensions.

    The reactionary press of the United States, Britain, West Germany, and several other countries has launched a large-scale propaganda campaign in an attempt to distort the true meaning of the events that occurred in Berlin on June 17. These newspapers are trying to prevent the broad masses from understanding the events, while concealing from public opinion the provocative actions of those forces that instigated and organized the Berlin adventure.

    Facts have proven that the provocative actions in Berlin on June 17 were meticulously planned by reactionary groups in Western countries and their accomplices among the large monopoly capitalists in West Germany. These people, for their selfish, anti-popular purposes, attempted to obstruct the cause of peace, worsen relations between countries, and create discord among them.

    The provocative actions taken in the democratic sector of Berlin were created by those who fear a peaceful resolution of the German question, fear the strength of the democratic forces of the German people, and loathe the achievements of the German Democratic Republic.

    Hostile forces to the German people, entrenched in the western sector of Berlin, mainly the American-occupied sector, have long been preparing to strike at the German Democratic Republic. According to the West German magazine "Der Spiegel," Adenauer's right-hand man, Bonn Minister Kaiser, who personally directed the provocative actions in Berlin, boasted as early as March last year that "the general plan -- so to speak -- is ready." The day for implementing the plan "will be sooner than the skeptics anticipate."

    There is every reason to believe that the British and French occupying authorities were privy to the preparations for the criminal adventure in Berlin.

    The confessions of the riot instigators arrested on June 17 show that the preparations for the provocative actions were carried out under the direct instructions of the American military authorities. Gangs of fascist adventurers were gathered in the American-occupied zone of Germany. American officers gave weapons and instructions to the riot makers hired with US dollars, and pointed out the targets for arson and attack. One of the mercenaries arrested on the day of the provocative incident, Werner Kalkowski -- one of the large number of fascist bandits sent from the American-occupied zone of Berlin to the democratic zone to organize riots -- confessed during interrogation: "We were ordered to attack government office buildings, commit arson, rob shops, attack the People's Police, generally take action against the authorities, and use weapons."

    The organizers of the Berlin provocative actions, in order to cover up their crimes, even attempted to portray the riots that occurred in Berlin on June 17 as an "expression of German sentiment." But we can ask these gentlemen: What does the fact that American trucks carrying gasoline bottles for burning houses happened to be on the border of the Soviet-occupied zone of Berlin when the riots began have to do with "German sentiment"? Wasn't bringing American loudspeakers there to incite riots? Didn't American officers mingle among the fascist bandits running wild in East Berlin for the same purpose? Weren't American planes distributing pre-prepared leaflets calling for continued strikes in factories over the democratic zone? Didn't American police directly participate in the kidnapping of Otto Nuschke, Deputy Prime Minister of the German Democratic Republic?

    The organizers of the provocative actions in the democratic sector of Berlin cannot deceive the people. The facts known to the world and revealed during the investigation of the June 17 incident irrefutably prove that on that day, the enemies of peace created a large-scale provocative action on the streets of the German capital that damaged the fundamental interests of the German people and the cause of world peace.

    Now, the facts clearly prove that the foreign mercenary adventure in Berlin was planned long ago and was funded by the American intelligence agencies, with money paid out of the one hundred million dollars appropriated by the United States Congress for sabotage activities against the Soviet Union and the people's democracies. The Western spies raised with this money attempted to incite a fascist riot in Berlin.

    Even the British bourgeois press pointed out that this provocative action was the result of a tremendous effort by Western countries. The British "Economist" wrote that what we are getting now is naturally "the culmination of years of effort by the BBC, the Voice of America, and Radio Free Europe." Another British magazine, "New Statesman and Nation," admitted that the Western claim that the riots were spontaneous should be understood in light of the well-known fact that millions of dollars spent on espionage and broadcasting propaganda were precisely to produce this effect.

    Confessions of this kind can be found not only in the British press but also in the American press. For example, according to a June 18 report by the United Press, some members of the United States Congress described the riots in Berlin as an achievement of American propaganda activities and the secret use of government secret funds. Senator Potter said that the riots in the democratic sector of Berlin, like the adventure undertaken by foreign spies in Czechoslovakia some time ago, were not accidental but were promoted by American efforts.

    There is no doubt that if foreign agitators had not instigated the Berlin adventure and if the fascist spies had not been receiving millions of dollars from certain groups across the ocean, this provocative incident would not have occurred.

    It is noteworthy in this regard that after the failure of the planned provocative action, President Eisenhower thought he could announce on June 18 that the United States would give West Berlin 50 million dollars in so-called additional aid. The official explanation is that this appropriation is to further strengthen the economy of West Berlin. However, Berliners believe that this dollar bribe is an attempt to cheer up those American spies who have suffered a disastrous defeat. This view is not without reason.

    The riots created by foreign spies in the democratic sector of Berlin cannot be regarded as an isolated event. The foreign mercenary adventure in Berlin and the provocative actions of the Syngman Rhee gang in South Korea are inextricably linked.

    The adventure of the fascist conspirators in Berlin and the adventure of Syngman Rhee in Korea are taking place precisely when the policy of the peace-loving forces has shown signs of easing international tensions, which is no accident.

    As a result of the Panmunjom negotiations, an agreement on the repatriation of prisoners of war was signed. A Korean armistice could have become a reality in recent days. However, a Korean ceasefire is not in the interest of the enemies of peace who gamble on war. In order to obstruct the signing of the Korean armistice agreement, these extremists took criminal provocative actions. On June 17, under the control of the American command, Syngman Rhee ordered the mass "release" of Korean prisoners of war in Masan, Pusan, and other prisoner-of-war camps, who were originally prepared to be handed over to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission for custody.

    Broad public opinion around the world is rightly commenting that the provocative action of the Syngman Rhee gang is a direct attempt to undermine the conclusion of the Korean armistice agreement. The meeting of Indian ambassadors to European countries, chaired by Nehru, expressed the views of broad public opinion, believing that Syngman Rhee's actions were deliberately aimed at obstructing the agreement that had actually been reached.

    It is not difficult to understand that the provocative actions in Berlin and South Korea pursue the same goal -- to prevent the growing forces of peace from easing international tensions, while launching reactionary forces, forces of war.

    It is no accident that extreme aggressors choose the present time to launch these provocative actions.

    Everyone knows that the government of the German Democratic Republic supports the efforts of peace-loving countries to ease international tensions and has recently taken a number of important measures to promote understanding between the two parts of Germany. The government of the German Democratic Republic has also adopted a number of decisions to greatly improve the welfare of the people at home. German and foreign public opinion rightly believe that these measures are important steps to create a common basis for reunifying the divided Germany into a unified, democratic, and peace-loving country.

    The Adenauer group and its masters believe that these measures by the government of the German Democratic Republic are undoubtedly a danger to their policy of obstructing Germany's unification and consolidating European peace at all costs.

    Foreign agitators incite Germans to embark on the path of war. For them, Germany is a foreign country, and the German people are foreigners. They attempt to use Germans to carry out their conspiracies, regardless of what consequences will occur for Germans. The failure of the criminal attempt by foreign mercenaries is a blessing for the German people and a blessing for the cause of peace in Europe. The Berlin incident proves that the democratic system of the German Democratic Republic is consolidated and that the government of the German Democratic Republic is supported by the broad masses of the people. The provocateurs' attempt to incite a considerable portion of Berlin residents failed. The strength of the people of the German Democratic Republic gave the fascist provocateurs and their foreign masters a decisive counterattack.

    Now, the organizers of the failed provocative action on June 17 are shedding crocodile tears for the victims in Berlin. But the tears of these hypocrites cannot deceive honest people. Wouldn't there have been riots or sacrifices if the masterminds behind the criminal adventure and the fascist riot makers and provocative bandits had not been sent into the democratic zone from the western sector? Is there anyone who does not understand this?

    The bankruptcy of the foreign mercenary adventure in Berlin has opened the eyes of many who believed the rumors of the propagandists -- the enemies of peace. Broad sections of the German people consider the criminal actions of the adventurous conspirators shameful. The working people of the German Democratic Republic support the measures taken by their government to crush the enemy's attacks. They support the various actions taken by the Republic's government to further improve living standards, develop private industry, private trade, and handicrafts, and develop agriculture. Millions of Germans understand that these measures will greatly help solve the main problem facing the German people, which is the unification of Germany on the basis of peace and democracy. The German people are very concerned about ending the division of their motherland. They will never follow those who are trying to push them into a new abyss of suffering and disaster. They will take the path of peace, democracy, and unity.

    In its statement "On the Situation and the Current Tasks of the Party" adopted by the plenary session of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany on June 21, after exposing the real instigators and criminals of the Berlin fascist adventure, it listed a number of concrete measures aimed at further consolidating the democratic regime of the German Democratic Republic and improving the material welfare of the working people. The statement emphasized the fundamental difference between two policies: the policy of the Adenauer group aimed at launching a war and the policy of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany and the government of the German Democratic Republic aimed at promoting peace. The statement said: "The goal of the policies of Adenauer, Ollenhauer, Kaiser, and Luther is war. Therefore, they are attacking us. Therefore, West Germany is becoming a hotbed of fascism and reactionaries.

    Our party and our government support peace. Therefore, the goal of our policy is to establish an exemplary peaceful economy. Our new policy is the most powerful weapon for the entire German people to use against any war provocation occurring on German soil."

    The Berlin and South Korean incidents prove that the enemies of peace will not hesitate to adopt the most extreme means to prevent the easing of international tensions and to undermine the cause of strengthening cooperation among the peoples of all countries. These events also prove that the strength of the people fighting for peace is growing and is giving a counterattack to the conspiracies of the enemies of peace. The foreign mercenary adventure in Berlin has suffered bankruptcy. The solidarity and organization of the peace-loving forces and the unity of their actions are a guarantee that the provocative actions of the Syngman Rhee gang and its protectors will also suffer bankruptcy.

    All those who cherish the cause of peace will draw the necessary conclusions from these events, will tirelessly raise vigilance, expose the conspiracies of reactionary groups, and further strengthen the struggle to defend and consolidate peace.

    外国雇佣分子在柏林冒险行动的破产
    ——苏联“真理报”六月二十三日社论
    在最近几天中，各国的广大舆论都为关于外国雇佣分子在柏林的冒险行动以及南朝鲜李承晚匪帮的挑衅行动的消息所震惊。无疑地，发生在不同的两个洲的这些事件是彼此不可分割地联系着的。我们所看到的是和平的敌人的罪恶阴谋、是害怕和平、不要和平并千方百计地不让国际紧张局势得到缓和的反动集团的罪恶阴谋。
    美国、英国、西德和若干其他国家的反动报刊展开了大规模的宣传，企图歪曲六月十七日在柏林发生的事件的真正意义。这些报刊极力不让广大的群众了解发生的事件，同时在舆论面前掩盖那些教唆并组织柏林的冒险行动的势力的挑衅行动。
    事实证明：六月十七日柏林的挑衅行动是经过西方国家的反动集团和他们在西德大垄断资本家中间的同谋者缜密筹划的。这些人们为了他们的自私的、反人民的目的，企图阻挠和平事业，使各国间的关系恶化并制造各国间的不和。
    在柏林民主区采取的挑衅行动是那些害怕和平解决德国问题、害怕德国人民的民主势力强大并憎厌德意志民主共和国的成就的人们所制造的。
    盘踞在柏林西区、主要是美占区的敌视德国人民的势力老早就在准备对德意志民主共和国施以打击。据西德杂志“明镜”周刊说，阿登纳的得力助手、亲自指挥柏林的挑衅行动的波恩部长凯撒早在去年三月就吹牛说：“总计划——可以这样说——已经准备好了。”实行计划的日子“将比持怀疑看法的人们所预料的为早”。
    完全有理由相信英国和法国占领当局是预闻柏林罪恶的冒险行动的准备工作的。
    从六月十七日被捕的骚乱挑拨者的供词中可以看出，挑衅行动的准备工作是在美国军事当局的直接指示之下进行的。法西斯冒险分子匪帮都麇集在德国美占区。美国军官给用美元雇来的骚乱制造者们以武器和指示，并向他们指明放火和攻击的目标。在挑衅事件发生的那一天被捕的雇佣分子之一、维尔纳·卡尔科夫斯基——他是柏林美占区派到民主区来组织暴动的大批法西斯匪徒之一——在受审时供称：“我们奉命袭击政府各部门办公大楼、纵火、抢商店、突击人民警察、普遍地采取反对当局的行动并使用武器。”
    柏林挑衅行动的组织者们为了掩盖罪恶，竟企图把六月十七日柏林发生的骚乱说成是“德国人感情的表现”。但是我们可以问问这些老爷们：当骚乱开始时，载着烧房屋用的汽油瓶的美国卡车恰巧在柏林苏占区的边界上，这种情形和“德国人的感情”有什么关系呢？难道把美国扩音器也弄到那里去不是为了鼓动暴乱吗？难道美国军官混在东柏林胡作非为的法西斯匪徒中间不是怀着同样的目的吗？难道在民主区上空散发事先准备好的、号召各工厂继续停工的传单的不是美国飞机吗？难道美国警察没有直接参与绑架德意志民主共和国副总理奥托·努舍克的行动吗？
    柏林民主区挑衅行动的组织者们是欺骗不了人民的。全世界已经知道的以及在六月十七日事件侦讯过程中揭露的事实无可争辩地证明了：在那一天，和平的敌人在德国首都的街道上，制造了一次损害德国人民的根本利益、损害世界和平事业的大规模挑衅行动。
    现在，事实昭然若揭地证明了，外国雇佣分子在柏林的冒险行动是很久以前就筹划好了的，并且是得到美国情报机关的资助的，而美国情报机关所用的钱是由美国国会拨充对苏联和人民民主国家进行破坏活动之用的一亿美元中支付的。用这一笔钱豢养出来的西方国家特务们企图在柏林挑起法西斯暴动。
    甚至英国资产阶级报纸也指出，这种挑衅行动是西方国家从事了巨大的努力的结果，英国“经济学家”写道，我们现在得到的结果自然是“英国广播公司”、“美国之音”和“自由欧洲”的广播宣传多年来努力所促成的高潮。另一份英国杂志“新政治家与民族”承认，对西方国家所谓的暴动是自发的这种说法应该根据人所共知的事实来理解，这就是，在特务和广播宣传方面花费的几百万美元，正是为的要产生这种效果。
    这一类的招供不仅可以在英国报纸上找到，而且在美国报纸上也可以找到。例如，据合众社六月十八日讯，美国国会某些议员就把柏林的骚动说成是美国宣传活动和暗地里使用政府秘密经费的成绩。参议员波特说，柏林民主区的骚动和若干时以前外国特务在捷克斯洛伐克所从事的冒险行动一样并不是偶然的，它是美国的努力所促成的。
    毫无疑问，如果没有外国煽动者鼓动柏林的冒险行动，如果法西斯特务得不到大洋那边的某些集团多少百万美元的接济，那就不会发生这次挑衅事件。
    在这方面值得注意的事情是，在有计划的挑衅行动失败后，艾森豪威尔总统就认为可以在六月十八日宣布，美国将给西柏林五千万美元的所谓额外援助。官方的说法是，这笔拨款是用来进一步加强西柏林的经济的。可是柏林人士却认为这笔美元收买费是企图替那些惨败的美国特务打气的，这种看法不是没有理由的。
    不能把外国特务在柏林民主区制造的骚乱认为是孤立的事件。外国雇佣分子在柏林的冒险行动和李承晚匪帮在南朝鲜的挑衅行动是彼此不可分地联系着的。
    法西斯阴谋分子在柏林的冒险行动和李承晚在朝鲜的冒险行动，恰好在由于爱好和平的力量的政策而出现了国际紧张局势缓和的标志的时候进行，不是偶然的。
    板门店谈判的结果，签订了遣返战俘协议。朝鲜停战本来在最近几天就可能成为现实的。然而朝鲜停火并不合以战争为赌注的和平的敌人的心意。为了阻碍朝鲜停战协定的签订，这些极端分子采取了罪恶的挑衅行动。六月十七日，在美国司令部控制下的马山、釜山和其他战俘营由李承晚下令，大批地“释放了”朝鲜战俘，这些战俘本来是准备交给中立国遣返委员会看管的。
    全世界广泛的舆论正当地评论李承晚匪帮这个挑衅行动是直接企图破坏朝鲜停战协定的缔结。由尼赫鲁主持的印度驻欧洲各国大使的会议表示了广泛的舆论的意见，会议认为李承晚的行动是故意要阻挠实际上已经达成的协议。
    不难了解，在柏林和在南朝鲜的挑衅行动追求着同一目的——使日益增长的和平力量不能缓和国际紧张局势，同时发动反动力量、战争力量。
    极端的侵略分子选择目前的时机来发动这些挑衅行动，并不是偶然的。
    每个人都知道，德意志民主共和国政府支持爱好和平国家的缓和国际紧张局势的努力，最近已采取了一些重要的措施来促进德国东西两部分的谅解。德意志民主共和国政府同时采取了使国内人民福利大大改善的一些决定。德国和国外的舆论都正当地认为这些措施是为把分裂的德国重新统一为统一的、民主的和爱好和平的国家创造共同基础的重要步骤。
    阿登纳集团和它的主子们认为德意志民主共和国政府的这些措施对于他们不惜一切代价来阻挠德国的统一和巩固欧洲和平的事业的政策无疑是一种危险。
    外国挑衅分子鼓动德国人走战争的道路。对于他们说来，德国是外国，德国人民是外国人。他们企图利用德国人来执行他们的阴谋，不管对于德国人将发生什么后果。外国雇佣分子的罪恶企图失败了，这是德国人民之幸，是欧洲的和平事业之幸。柏林事件证明，德意志民主共和国的民主制度是巩固的，德意志民主共和国政府得到广大的人民群众的支持。挑衅分子打算煽动起相当一部分柏林居民的企图失败了。德意志民主共和国人民的力量给了法西斯挑衅分子和他们的外国主子以决定性的反击。
    现在，六月十七日这次失败的挑衅行动的组织者像猫哭老鼠那样地为柏林的牺牲者掉泪了。但这种伪善者的眼泪欺骗不了正直的人民。要不是罪恶的冒险行动的幕后组织者，要是法西斯暴动制造者和挑衅分子匪徒没有被从西区派入民主区的话，就不会发生骚乱，也不会有人牺牲，这一点，难道还有人不明白吗？
    外国雇佣分子在柏林的冒险行动的破产把那些相信宣传家们——和平的敌人——的谣言的许多人的眼睛打开了。广大阶层的德国人民认为冒险分子阴谋分子的罪恶行动是可耻的。德意志民主共和国的劳动人民支持他们的政府所采取的粉碎敌人进攻的措施。他们拥护共和国政府所采取的进一步提高生活水平、发展私营工业、私营贸易和手工业以及发展农业的各种行动。千百万的德国人都明白这些措施将大大有助于解决德国人民面前的主要问题，就是在和平与民主的基础上统一德国的问题。德国人民非常关心结束他们祖国的分割状态。他们决不会追随那些正在企图把他们推入新的痛苦和灾难的深渊的人们。他们将走和平民主与统一的道路。
    德国统一社会党中央委员会全体会议在六月二十一日通过的“关于局势与党当前的任务”的声明中，在揭发了柏林法西斯冒险行动的真正的鼓动者和罪恶分子以后，列举了一些旨在进一步巩固德意志民主共和国民主政权和提高劳动人民物质福利的具体措施。声明着重指出两种政策之间的基本区别：阿登纳集团所奉行的目的在于发动战争的政策以及德国统一社会党和德意志民主共和国政府所奉行的目的在于促进和平的政策。声明说：“阿登纳、奥伦豪尔、凯撒、和鲁特的政策的目标是战争。因此他们才向我们进攻。因此西德才正在变成法西斯主义和反动派的温床。
    我们的党和我们的政府拥护和平。因此我们政策的目标是建立模范的和平经济。我们的新方针是全体德国人民用来对付在德国土地上所发生的任何战争挑衅的最有力的武器。”
    柏林事件和南朝鲜事件证明：和平的敌人将毫不犹豫地采用最极端的手段来阻止国际紧张局势的缓和，以破坏各国人民加强合作的事业。这些事件还证明，为和平而斗争的人民的力量正在日益壮大，正在给予和平的敌人的阴谋以反击。外国雇佣分子在柏林的冒险行动遭受了破产。爱好和平的力量的团结一致和有组织以及他们行动的一致是使李承晚匪帮及其庇护者的挑衅行动也遭受破产的保证。
    一切珍视和平事业的人们将从这些事件中得出必要的结论，将不倦地提高警惕，揭发反动集团的阴谋，更加加强维护与巩固和平的斗争。
