Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, June 20th. The "Labor News" published an editorial on the 20th entitled "Does the U.S. Want an Armistice or to Continue the War?" condemning the US for condoning the Syngman Rhee gang's serious breach of agreement in "releasing" prisoners of war.

The editorial said: All conscientious people in the world are praising the consistent efforts of the Chinese and Korean people and looking forward to the early realization of the Korean armistice. The only obstacle to the Korean armistice—the issue of prisoner of war repatriation—was agreed upon on June 8th, and all remaining details have been resolved satisfactorily. Both sides have made all preparations for signing the armistice at Panmunjom. However, before the ink was dry on the agreement on prisoner of war repatriation, the U.S. condoned Syngman Rhee’s “release” of a large number of so-called “unwilling to be repatriated prisoners of war” at dawn on June 18th, destroying the already signed agreement on prisoner of war repatriation, exposing the U.S. attempt to forcibly detain prisoners of war, and causing the Korean armistice negotiations to face a crisis again.

The editorial pointed out: All indications show that the U.S. anti-armistice elements are putting on a double act with the Syngman Rhee gang. At the same time, the U.S. Air Force's indiscriminate bombing of peaceful towns and villages in the rear of Korea is clearly a planned action to sabotage the armistice negotiations.

The editorial said: Today, Syngman Rhee's "release" of prisoners of war is precisely a planned performance of Syngman Rhee's "opposition to the armistice" under the direction of the U.S. anti-armistice elements. This naive trick of the U.S. cannot fool anyone.

The editorial asked: Does Eisenhower really want the early realization of the Korean armistice that the people of the world unanimously expect? Or does he want to destroy the signed agreement and continue and expand the war?

The editorial emphasized: If the U.S. truly hopes for the early realization of the Korean armistice and a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, it should immediately retract its unreasonable action of forcibly detaining prisoners of war and take urgent measures to reach an armistice agreement as soon as possible. Otherwise, it should bear the responsibility for the consequences arising therefrom.

The editorial concluded: Our attitude and position are clear. We will not allow the act of forcibly detaining prisoners of war. We will resolutely defend our rights. The American generals need to remember a Korean proverb: "If you drag your tail too long, it will be stepped on."

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, June 20th. The Korean Central News Agency correspondent in Panmunjom commented on the enemy's "release" of 25,000 Korean People's Army prisoners of war in a report on the 19th, saying: This agreement-breaking event is another conspiracy by the Wall Street lackey Syngman Rhee, instigated by his master, to sabotage the armistice negotiations. Although Syngman Rhee clamored that he was responsible for it himself and had not reached a full agreement with the United Nations Command; however, in front of the peace-loving people of the world who are closely watching Panmunjom, the facts cannot be concealed. The Syngman Rhee gang has long clamored against the armistice, but his master—the U.S.—has not taken any measures to prevent and condone this. Moreover, the prisoner of war camps in South Korea are all under the jurisdiction of the U.S., and there are no prisoner of war camps under the management of Syngman Rhee. All these facts prove that the United Nations Command condoned Syngman Rhee in creating this intolerable provocative act in order to deliberately sabotage the armistice negotiations. This incident also shows that the U.S. wants to break the agreement on the repatriation of prisoners of war signed not long ago and has not given up its attempt to forcibly detain our captured personnel.

The Korean Central News Agency reporter said: We cannot help but suspect again: Does the U.S. have the sincerity to achieve an armistice? Is it willing to implement the agreements reached by both sides? If the U.S. truly wants to realize the Korean armistice, then it should responsibly handle this incident and restore the illegally "released" prisoners of war to their original state. The Korean and Chinese people and the people of the world are watching Washington and Tokyo with sharp eyes. Does the U.S. need to express its willingness to have an armistice or to continue the war with actions rather than words?

### 朝鲜“劳动新闻”和朝鲜中央通讯社  谴责美方纵容李承晚严重破坏协议的行为

    朝鲜“劳动新闻”和朝鲜中央通讯社
    谴责美方纵容李承晚严重破坏协议的行为
    【新华社平壤二十日电】“劳动新闻”二十日以
    “美方想停战呢？还是想继续战争呢？”为题发表社论，谴责美方纵容李承晚匪帮“释放”战俘的严重破坏协议行为。
    社论说：全世界有良心的人都在赞扬着朝中两国人民一贯的努力，并期待着朝鲜停战的早日实现。朝鲜停战的唯一障碍——战俘遣返问题已于六月八日达成协议，剩下的各项细节问题也已获得圆满解决。在板门店，双方并已做了一切停战签字的准备工作。但是，当关于战俘遣返问题的协议墨迹未干的时候，美方却纵容李承晚于六月十八日拂晓“释放”了大批所谓“不愿被遣返的战俘”，破坏了业已签订的关于战俘遣返问题的协议，暴露了美方强迫扣留战俘的企图，使朝鲜停战谈判重新遭到危机。
    社论指出：一切迹象表明，美国反停战分子是在和李承晚匪帮合演双簧。与此同时，美国空军对朝鲜后方和平城乡的狂轰滥炸，显然是企图破坏停战谈判的有计划行动。
    社论说：今天，李承晚对战俘的“释放”，就正是在美国反停战分子导演下，李承晚“反对停战”这出戏有计划的演出。美方这种幼稚的把戏，是骗不了任何人的。
    社论问道：艾森豪威尔到底是愿意世界人民所一致期待的朝鲜停战早日实现呢？还是破坏已签订了的协议而继续和扩大战争呢？
    社论强调指出：假如美方真正希望朝鲜停战早日实现，和平解决朝鲜问题的话，就应该立刻收回它强迫扣留战俘的无理行动，而采取早日达成停战协定的紧急措施。否则，它就应该承当由此引起的后果的责任。
    社论最后说：我方的态度和立场是明确的。我们不容许强迫扣留战俘的行为。我们将坚决保卫自己的权利。美国将军们有必要牢记朝鲜的一句谚语：
    “尾巴拖长了，就会被人踩的”。
    【新华社平壤二十日电】朝鲜中央通讯社驻板门店记者十九日在报道中评论敌方“释放”二万五千名朝鲜人民军战俘的事件说：这个破坏协议的事件，是华尔街的走狗李承晚在其主子的嗾使下制造的又一个破坏停战谈判的阴谋。尽管李承晚叫嚷说这是他自己负责干的，并没有和联合国军司令部取得充分的协议；但是，在密切注视着板门店的全世界爱好和平人民的面前，事实是隐瞒不了的。李承晚匪帮早就叫嚣着反对停战，然而他的主子——美方对此却并没有采取过任何措施而予以纵容。何况南朝鲜的战俘营都是美方管辖的，而并没有管理权属于李承晚的战俘营存在。这一切事实都证实了联合国军司令部纵容李承晚制造了这种不可容忍的挑拨行为，来有意地破坏停战谈判。这一事件并说明，美方要破坏在不久以前签订的关于遣返战俘的协议，仍未放弃其强迫扣留我方被俘人员的企图。
    朝鲜中央通讯社记者说：我们不能不再次作这样的怀疑：美方是否具有停战的诚意？是否愿意实行双方已达成的协议？如果，美方真正愿意实现朝鲜停战，那么，它就应该负责地处理这个事件，把非法“释放”了的战俘恢复到原来的状态。朝中人民和全世界人民正以锐利的眼光监视着华盛顿和东京。美方不须要以言语而须要以行动来表示它愿意停战呢？还是愿意继续进行战争？
