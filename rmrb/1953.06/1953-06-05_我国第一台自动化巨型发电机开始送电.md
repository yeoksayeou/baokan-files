China's First Automated Giant Generator Begins Supplying Power

[This newspaper report] Our nation's first giant, fully automated generator has been installed and officially began supplying power on the afternoon of April 27th. This is a major victory for China's power industry.

This generator has a very large capacity and is fully automated. It has various devices such as automatic voltage adjustment, automatic frequency adjustment, and automatic insurance. This can not only save a lot of labor, but also provide a very high degree of safety in operation. When generating electricity, simply press a button, and this huge generator will automatically start operating and generating electricity in six minutes; the huge power automatically "joins" the ultra-high-voltage power system, and many factories and mines will obtain strong power.

The design, installation, and operation of this huge project were carried out with the selfless assistance of Soviet experts. All the equipment of this generator is the latest and most advanced Soviet machinery. Due to the superiority in design and manufacturing, its body and weight are the same as those of machines in capitalist countries, but its power generation capacity is 22% greater than that of machines in capitalist countries. During the installation of the new machine, Soviet experts gave us tremendous help. They sincerely guided the technicians in formulating technical regulations, making measure plans, and drawing instruction charts. During the tense period of trial operation of the new machine, all the experts worked with the workers day and night. Our technicians and workers also worked actively with a high degree of patriotism, and successively put forward 504 rationalization proposals. With the efforts of all employees and the help of Soviet experts, this huge installation project was finally completed at a speed of eighty-three days.

A grand power generation ceremony was held on the afternoon of April 27th. Chen Yu, Minister of the Central Ministry of Fuel Industry, cut the ribbon, and the local government leader executed the start-up. When the strong power began to be sent out and the indicator light of the generator head was bright, the colorful lights assembled throughout the factory suddenly shone brightly, the loudspeaker broadcasted the song "The East is Red", and people enthusiastically cheered this great victory in China's economic construction. At the ceremony, Minister Chen Yu called on all technicians and employees to follow Chairman Mao's instructions, actively and conscientiously learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, and develop China's power industry.

    我国第一台自动化巨型发电机开始送电
    【本报讯】我国第一台巨型的、完全自动化的发电机已安装完成，并于四月二十七日下午正式开始送电。这是我国电力事业上的一个重大胜利。
    这座发电机的容量很大，而且是完全自动化的。它有自动调整电压、自动调整周波以及自动保险等各种装置，这不但可以简省很多劳动力，而且在操作上可以有极高度的安全保证。在发电时，只要一按电钮，这座巨大的发电机在六分钟后就开始自动运转发电；巨大的电力自动“合车”并入超高压电力系统，许多工厂和矿山就获得了强大的电力。
    这个巨大工程的设计、安装以及运转，都是在苏联专家的无私帮助下进行的。这座发电机的全部设备是苏联最新式最先进的机器，由于在设计与制造上的优越性，它的机体和重量与资本主义国家的机器一样，而发电能力却比资本主义国家的机器大百分之二十二。在新机器安装过程中，苏联专家们给了我们巨大的帮助，他们诚恳地指导技术人员订技术规程，做措施计划和画指示图表。在新机器试行运转的紧张时期，全体专家们日以继夜地和工人们在一起工作。我国技术人员和工人们也以高度的爱国热情积极工作，先后提出了五百零四件合理化建议。在全体职工的努力和苏联专家的帮助下，这一巨大规模的安装工程终于以八十三天的速度完成。
    四月二十七日下午举行了隆重的发电典礼，由中央燃料工业部部长陈郁剪彩，当地人民政府首长执行开机。当强大的电力开始送出，发电机头的表示灯明亮时，全厂装配的五光十色的彩灯顿时齐放光明，扩音器播送着“东方红”歌曲，人们热情地欢呼我国经济建设上的这又一伟大胜利。陈郁部长在典礼仪式上号召全体技术人员和职工，遵照毛主席的指示，积极和认真地学习苏联的先进经验，来发展我国的电力事业。
