    Jiangxi Province's Five Key Pilot Townships Complete Universal Suffrage Work
    (Our Special Correspondent Yu Mingchun reports) The Jiangxi Provincial People's Government and relevant Special Commissioner's Offices organized work teams that went to Wu Jia Township in Yiyang County, Bei Cun Township in Ningdu County, Hu Bian Township in Gan County, Geng Tou Township in Nanchang County, and Yang Mei Township in Dingnan County in early and mid-March to conduct the first batch of pilot universal suffrage work. After about a month and a half, these efforts concluded before April 20th. The second batch of pilot universal suffrage work began in early June. The first batch of pilot work in the aforementioned five townships generally went through four stages: population survey and voter registration, determining and reviewing candidates, holding voter congresses to elect representatives, and convening people's representative congresses. Throughout the process, attention was paid to integrating with production, and extensive publicity about the universal suffrage work was conducted based on the ideological situation of cadres and the masses. This ensured that the pilot work achieved good results, representatives were well-chosen, and the work of the township people's government was initially rectified, promoting production.
    Before the population survey and voter registration work began, the work team first convened meetings of township cadres and rural Party, Youth League members, and activists to explain the great significance, policies, and methods of the election to them, and to understand their ideological situation. In general, township cadres initially had a vague understanding of the significance of universal suffrage, believing that universal suffrage was simply a "re-election." Some did not adequately understand the struggle against bureaucratism, commandism, and violations of law and discipline, resulting in "backsliding" emotions and thoughts of "changing shifts," and their work became lax and perfunctory. In response to these situations, the work team patiently educated them, explaining the purpose of the election. At the same time, it was explained that for individual elements who violated law and discipline and made serious mistakes and were dissatisfied with the people, it was entirely right to remove them from their current positions through popular elections; only in this way could our organs of state power be more consolidated and better serve the people. For cadres with general shortcomings, it was explained that as long as they made sincere self-criticisms to the people and corrected their shortcomings in this election, the people would forgive them. After the cadres' concerns were dispelled, the work team and township cadres organized themselves to go deep among the masses and carry out extensive publicity without hindering production. The publicity methods were simple, easy to implement, and convenient for the masses, and special attention was paid to not affecting production. In addition to general publicity, specific publicity was carried out in light of the thinking of the masses. For example, some people thought that holding elections every year was too troublesome; individual elderly people said, "The election has nothing to do with me; it is a matter for young people"; some elderly women thought they were uneducated, "don't understand anything," and said, "Women never care about these things," etc. Therefore, specific explanations to the elderly and women were even more important. After this meticulous publicity, the people's sense of being masters of the country was further enhanced, and they began to cherish their democratic rights.
    After the masses had a certain understanding of universal suffrage, population surveys and voter registration began. First, electoral districts were divided according to the natural circumstances of the voters' residence. According to the experience of these townships, it was best to divide one natural village into one electoral district, because in this way the masses understood each other and it was convenient for the elderly and women to participate. The division of electoral districts was generally discussed and drafted by the township election committee, then submitted to the masses for discussion and comments, and finally decided by the election committee. The masses also had concerns during the division of electoral districts. For example, in Chen and Pan families in Wu Jia Township, Yiyang County, had been consistently at odds before liberation. This time, twelve households of the Chen family were merged into the Pan family's electoral district, and they were afraid of suffering losses. Later, they were told that the reason for the disharmony was caused by feudal society. Now, farmers all over the world are one family, and small surnames must never be allowed to suffer losses. As a result, the masses were very satisfied. After the electoral districts were divided, investigation and registration stations were set up in each electoral district, and mass meetings were held to explain the significance of investigation and registration. At the same time, in accordance with the policies, it was repeatedly explained who had the right to vote, who did not have the right to vote, and the order and methods of registration, and then registration was carried out in turn. When registering, the name, age, ethnicity, whether the population had increased or decreased, and whether there were any people who had gone out were clarified one by one according to the original household registration book. After the records were made, they were read again for everyone to review and correct, and the masses were asked to submit opinions on who should be deprived of the right to vote. Those who should have the right to vote but the masses had objections to were explained to the masses in accordance with the policies. For example, Wu Lianying, a poor peasant in Xia Cun, Bei Cun Township, was originally from Anhui and had practiced martial arts. In the past, he often fought with people, and others often suffered losses from him. This time, the masses originally did not intend to give him the right to vote and be elected, but after the persuasion and education of the staff, he also admitted his mistakes to the masses, and the masses still gave him democratic rights. Those who should be deprived of the right to vote in accordance with the law were announced on the spot. After the review was completed, the list of voters in the township was published in accordance with the provisions of the Electoral Law, and the voter registration forms were distributed to the villages to be announced at mass meetings, and discussions were held among the masses to put forward opinions. After the voters were determined, voter certificates were issued.
    Voter registration and the review of voter qualifications is a very important and complex task. This work is actually a process of further educating the people on the people's democratic dictatorship. If it is not done well, it will affect the unity of the people and may also give the enemy an opportunity to exploit, creating a situation where enemies and friends are indistinguishable. According to the experience of several pilot townships in Jiangxi Province, the following boundaries should be strictly distinguished: The first category is citizens with the right to vote and be elected; the second category is counter-revolutionaries and members of the landlord class who have been deprived of the right to vote and be elected; the third category is people within the ranks of the people who are under the age of eighteen and cannot temporarily obtain voter qualifications; the fourth category is people within the ranks of the people who have been temporarily suspended from voter qualifications due to mental illness; the fifth category is people who have been deprived of or have had their right to vote and be elected revoked during the execution of their sentences for committing crimes (but not counter-revolutionary crimes). During voter registration and review, it is necessary to ensure that not a single person in the first category is omitted; the second category must be told that only by honestly engaging in labor reform can they change their class status after a certain period and obtain voter qualifications; the reasons for the third and fourth categories must be explained clearly; and the fifth category must also be strictly distinguished from counter-revolutionaries. When determining voter qualifications, it is necessary to comply with the central government's regulations to prevent "leftist" and rightist tendencies, and it is also necessary to combine the review of class status and control work, and the masses' appeals regarding the right to vote must also be handled seriously and conscientiously. Only in this way can we achieve the goal of not allowing a single reactionary or landlord class element to illegally usurp sacred political rights, nor allowing a single citizen to be wrongly deprived of sacred political rights.
    The second stage is determining and reviewing candidates. In this stage, some townships jointly nominated candidates through the Communist Party, the Youth League organization, and mass organizations before holding consultations, while other townships discussed candidates in voter groups. Regardless of whether the candidates were jointly nominated or nominated by voter groups, the nominated candidates were distributed to the voters for discussion and opinions, and finally the primary election committee was convened to discuss and determine the list of candidates for the entire township; after the determination, it was announced in accordance with the law, and the date and location of the election meeting were announced.
    When discussing and determining the list of candidates, the townships grasped the representative figures of all strata. The masses were very serious and cautious about nominating candidates, and there was a lot of debate. For example, in Bei Cun Township, some people said that "those who know how to handle official business" should be found to be candidates. Immediately, someone retorted, "There are many Kuomintang officials who know how to 'handle official business,' but they don't work for the people and oppress us!" After everyone discussed, they thought that four conditions were sufficient: First, be active in work; second, be able to connect with the masses; third, be selfless; fourth, be loyal and honest. Finally, someone added, "It would be even better if they knew a few words, had a good class background, and had the ability to work." Finally, the masses nominated candidates based on these conditions, and everyone was very satisfied, saying, "This is truly democracy in action."
    While discussing representative candidates, a struggle against bureaucratism, commandism, and violations of law and discipline was combined. The method was to fully promote democracy, call on the masses to raise opinions on cadres, and call on cadres to carry out criticism and self-criticism. Therefore, the masses could actively criticize the shortcomings and mistakes of the cadres. The criticized township cadres finally made self-criticisms in front of the masses and expressed their determination to correct their mistakes in the future. After this education, the cadres further established the viewpoint of serving the people and realized the importance of promoting democracy and following the mass line. At the same time, it is also necessary to commend good cadres. Only in this way can we point out the direction of effort for cadres.
    The third stage is convening a voter congress to elect representatives. After the above series of publicity and education, the people have realized the solemnity of their political rights. The voters participating in the election were in high spirits. Some said, "This right is my own. It only exists under the leadership of Chairman Mao. I must never give it up." Some held voter certificates and said, "Don't look down on this piece of paper. This is the power to be the master of the house!" A very high proportion of voters participated in the election. For example, in Bei Cun Township, there were a total of 1,220 voters, and 1,073 people attended, accounting for 88% of all voters. Because there had been sufficient deliberation before the election, the representatives produced had a relatively broad representation and took care of all aspects. Among the 29 representatives elected in Bei Cun Township, there were six women representatives. The masses generally reflected, "It's really not easy to elect a representative. It's like choosing seeds, choosing again and again. This is true democracy in action." The election method was mostly by raising hands to vote.
    The fourth stage is convening a people's representative congress at the grassroots level. In these townships, after the representatives were elected and before the congress was convened, the representatives went to various electoral districts to solicit opinions from the masses and collect proposals. The representative congress focused on discussing and solving problems in spring plowing production. In addition to discussing production work, the representative congresses elected new township people's government committees and township chiefs, rectified organizations, and established and improved meeting systems. According to the investigation of various townships, there were many rural organizations. Some townships had 15 committees, cadres held multiple positions, and meetings were held frequently, affecting production. After rectification, it was generally changed to four committees, namely, the civil affairs, production, cultural and educational health, and public security committees, which worked under the leadership of the township people's government.
    In general, the above-mentioned townships paid attention to taking care of the masses' production time in the universal suffrage work. When the work team publicized to the masses, they mostly used the masses' rest time after dinner, no more than two hours each time. Mass meetings were rarely held, and small gatherings of party members, youth league members, women, the elderly, militiamen, and cadres were mostly held; and this type of meeting was generally held once, at most three times, throughout the universal suffrage process. The reason why the meetings were short and few was because the work team had learned about the ideological situation of the masses in advance and publicized in light of the ideological situation of the masses, which was very effective. The personnel of the work team often learned about the ideological situation of the masses during the day in the fields or at home, or from the reports of township cadres, and then studied solutions. After the Shang Bei Cun work team learned that the local elderly women were not concerned about this universal suffrage because they did not often participate in social activities in the past, they studied and convened a meeting of elderly women to explain the significance of universal suffrage and encourage them to actively participate in universal suffrage. Hu Bian Township used rainy days to hold mass meetings. Yang Mei Township started with solving farmers' production to carry out universal suffrage publicity. In the past, the farmers in the township did not understand the mutual aid and cooperation policy, and the mutual aid groups were not consolidated. The work team temporarily put down the publicity of universal suffrage and explained the mutual aid and cooperation policy to the masses. The masses were in high spirits, and 46 households voluntarily formed eight mutual aid groups and formulated production increase plans, which promoted the production of the entire township. On this basis, the work team then explained the relationship between state power and production to the masses, and called on the masses to actively participate in universal suffrage, which was very welcome by the masses. Bei Cun Township occupied the masses' time for two days during the population survey and voter registration, and the voter congress occupied less than one day (starting at about 9:00 in the morning and ending at 3:00 in the afternoon), which met the requirements of the Central Election Committee.
    After universal suffrage in these townships, the enthusiasm of the broad masses for participating in politics has been greatly improved, the tendency of some masses to bury themselves in production and not ask about politics has been reversed, the masses have more clearly distinguished the boundaries between the enemy and ourselves, and the enemy has become more isolated. The prestige of the township people's congress has been established, the relationship between cadres and the masses has become closer, and the estrangement between villages in some areas has also been resolved. For example, Hu Da Yan, the cadre of Shang Cun in Hu Bian Township, and Hu Jia Ming, the member of the Farmers Association, exchanged fields to enrich themselves and embezzled the fruits of struggle in the land reform review, and acted tyrannically towards the masses. This time, they were sharply criticized, they reviewed their mistakes, and the exchange of fields and the fruits of struggle were dealt with according to the opinions of the masses, and the cadres and the masses were very satisfied. Shi Ru Village had a deep estrangement because it was fighting with Xia Cun for a set of gongs and drums (the common fruits of struggle), and the problem was also resolved after the democratic education of universal suffrage. In particular, because democracy has been promoted, the masses have dared to actively criticize the people's government and cadres. The masses said, "The government's work will be easier to carry out in the future, and the masses' difficulties will be easier to solve."

    江西省五个重点试验乡完成普选工作
    本报特约通讯员于明春报道：江西省人民政府和有关专署组织工作组于三月上、中旬先后在弋阳县的吴家乡、宁都县的背村乡、赣县的湖边乡、南昌县的埂头乡、定南县的杨梅乡进行的第一批普选典型试验工作，各经过约一个半月的时间，已于四月二十日前分别结束。第二批普选典型试验工作也已于六月上旬开始。第一批上述五乡的典型试验工作，一般都经过了人口调查和选民登记、确定和审查候选人、召开选民大会选举代表、召开人民代表大会等四个阶段。整个过程都注意了结合生产，并根据干部和群众的思想情况，广泛地进行了关于普选工作的宣传，使这次试验工作得到较好的成绩，选好了代表，还初步整顿了乡人民政府工作，推动了生产。
    人口调查和选民登记工作开始之前，工作组先召开乡干部和农村党、团员及积极分子会议，向他们说明选举的重大意义、政策和作法，了解他们的思想情况。乡干部在开始时一般对普选的意义认识模糊，认为普选就是“改选”；有的对结合反对官僚主义、命令主义和违法乱纪的斗争认识不够，而产生“退坡”情绪和“换班”思想，工作松劲疲沓。根据这些情况，工作组对他们分别进行了耐心的教育，说明选举的目的。同时说明对个别违法乱纪和犯有严重错误而为人民所不满意的分子，经过人民选举，把他们从现在的工作岗位上剔除出去，是完全应该的；这样才能使我们的政权机关更加巩固，更好地为人民服务。对一般有缺点的干部，说明他们在这次选举中只要向人民群众作诚恳的自我批评，改正缺点，人民群众是会原谅他们的。干部顾虑打消后，在不妨碍生产的情况下，工作组和乡干部组织起来，深入群众，展开广泛的宣传。宣传方式上注意了简单易行、便利群众，特别注意了不影响生产。除一般的宣传外，还针对群众思想进行具体的宣传。如有的群众认为：年年搞选举，太麻烦；个别老年人说：“选举与我没有什么关系，是年青人的事”；有些老年妇女认为自己没文化，“啥也不懂”，说“妇女从来不管这些事情”等等，因此，对老年人和妇女进行具体解释，更为重要。经过这一段细致的宣传之后，人民群众的国家主人翁感觉进一步提高，对自己的民主权利开始珍重起来。
    在群众对普选有了一定的认识之后，即开始进行人口调查和选民登记。首先根据选民的居住自然情况划分选区。根据这几个乡的经验，一个自然村划为一个选区为最好，因为这样群众互相了解，又便利老年人和妇女参加。划分选区，一般是由乡选举委员会讨论订出方案，然后再交群众讨论，提出意见，最后由选举委员会决定。在划分选区当中群众也是有顾虑的，如弋阳县吴家乡的陈、潘两姓在解放前一贯不和睦，此次陈家并入潘家选区的有十二户，他们怕吃亏。后来对他们说明不和睦的原因是封建社会造成的，现在天下农民是一家，决不能让小姓吃亏，结果群众都很满意。选区划好后，即按选区分别设立调查登记站，召开群众会，讲清调查登记的意义，同时根据政策反复说明那些人有选举权，那些人没有选举权，说明登记次序及登记办法，然后依次进行登记。登记时，根据原有户口册，一一问明姓名、年龄、民族、人口有无增减、有无外出。记好后，再读一遍，让大家审查校正，并由群众提出那些人应剥夺选举权的意见。应有选举权而群众有意见的，即根据政策向群众进行解释。如背村乡下村贫农吴莲英，原是安徽人，练过武术，过去常和人打架，别人常吃他的亏。这次群众原不打算给他选举权与被选举权，但经过工作人员的说服教育，他本人也向群众承认了错误，群众还是给了他民主权利。对应依法剥夺选举权的则当场宣布。审查完毕，依照选举法的规定把全乡选民名单列榜公布，同时把选民登记表发交各村在群众会上宣布，并在群众中展开讨论，提出意见。选民确定后，开始发选民证。
    选民登记和选民资格的审查，是一项非常重要的复杂的工作。这项工作实际上是对人民进一步进行人民民主专政教育的过程，如果做不好，就会影响人民内部的团结，也可能给敌人钻空子，造成敌我不分。根据江西省几个典型试验乡的经验，应该严格区别下列几种界限：第一种是有选举权和被选举权的公民；第二种是被剥夺选举权和被选举权的反革命分子和地主阶级分子；第三种是人民内部年龄不满十八周岁，暂时不能取得选民资格的；第四种是人民内部因患精神病而暂时停止选民资格的；第五种是人民因犯法（但不是反革命罪犯）被剥夺或在执刑期间被取消选举权与被选举权的。在选民登记和审查中，必须保证第一种人不遗漏一个；对第二种人告诉他们只有老老实实劳动改造，才能在一定时期后改变成份，取得选民资格；对第三、第四种人要解释清楚道理；对第五种人，也要与反革命分子严格区别开。在确定选民资格时，必须遵照中央规定进行，防止“左”右倾向，并必须结合审查成份和管制工作，对群众关于选举权的申诉也必须作严肃认真的处理。这样才能达到不让一个反动分子或地主阶级分子非法窃取庄严的政治权利，也不让一个公民被错误地剥夺庄严的政治权利。
    第二阶段是确定和审查候选人。在这一阶段，有的乡是共产党和青年团组织、群众团体联合提出候选人再进行协商，有的乡是以选民小组为单位进行讨论，提出候选人。不论是联合提名或选民小组提名，都是把提出的候选人发交选民讨论，提出意见，最后召开基层选举委员会讨论确定全乡候选人名单；确定后依法公布，并且公布选举大会日期和地点。
    在讨论和确定候选人名单时，各乡均掌握了各阶层的代表人物。群众对提候选人非常认真、慎重，争论也很大。如背村乡有人说“要找会办公事的”当候选人，马上就有人反驳说：“国民党的当官的有不少人就会‘办公事’，可是他不给人民办事，还压迫我们！”经过大家讨论，认为有四个条件就可以：第一、工作积极；第二、能联系群众；第三、大公无私；第四、忠诚老实。最后还有人补充说：“再识几个字、成份好、有工作能力就更好。”最后群众就根据这些条件提出候选人，大家都很满意，都说：“这真是民主当家了。”
    在讨论代表候选人的同时，结合进行了反官僚主义、命令主义、违法乱纪的斗争。方法是充分发扬民主，号召群众对干部提意见，号召干部开展批评与自我批评。因此群众对干部的缺点错误，都能进行积极的批评。被批评的乡干部最后在群众面前进行了自我批评，并表示今后决心改过。干部经过这次教育，进一步树立了为人民服务的观点，认识到发扬民主、走群众路线的重要。与此同时，也必须表扬好的干部。这样才能给干部指出努力的方向。
    第三阶段是召开选民大会选举代表。经过上述一系列的宣传教育后，人民群众已认识到自己的政治权利的庄严。参加选举的选民情绪都很高。有的说：“这权利是我自己的，是毛主席领导才有的，我绝不能放弃。”有的拿着选民证说：“不要看轻这张纸，这是当家作主的大权啊！”参加选举的达到了选民很高的比例，如背村乡共有选民一千二百二十人，到会的有一千零七十三人，占全体选民的百分之八十八。由于在选举前经过了充分的酝酿，因而产生的代表是有比较广泛代表性的，照顾了各个方面。背村乡选出的二十九名代表中有妇女代表六名。群众普遍反映：“选一个代表真不容易啊，像选种籽一样，选了又选，这才是真正的民主当家。”选举方式，大部是举手表决。
    第四阶段是召开基层单位人民代表大会。这几个乡在代表选出后、大会召开前，代表都深入到各个选区征求群众意见和搜集提案。代表大会都以讨论和解决春耕生产中的问题为中心内容。代表大会除讨论生产工作外，都选举了新的乡人民政府委员会和乡长，整顿了组织，建立与健全了会议制度。根据各乡调查，乡村组织很多，有的乡有十五个委员会，干部兼职多，经常开会，影响生产。经过整顿，
    一般改为四个委员会，即民政、生产、文教卫生、治安保卫委员会，在乡人民政府领导下进行工作。
    上述各乡在普选工作中，一般都注意照顾了群众的生产时间。工作组向群众进行宣传时，多利用群众晚饭后的休息时间，每次不超过两小时。召开群众大会很少，多是举行党团员、妇女、老年、民兵、干部小型集会；且这种类型的会，在整个普选过程中，一般是一次，最多三次。会议之所以开得短而少，是因为工作组事先了解了群众的思想情况，针对群众思想情况进行宣传，收效很大。工作组的人员经常在白天到田间或家庭中或由乡干部的汇报中，了解群众的思想情况，然后研究解决办法。上背村工作组在了解到当地老年妇女因过去不常参加社会活动，对此次普选不关心的情况后，经过研究，召开了老年妇女会，说明普选的意义，鼓舞她们积极参加普选。湖边乡是利用雨天召开群众会。杨梅乡从解决农民生产入手，进行普选宣传。过去该乡农民对互助合作政策不了解，互助组不巩固，工作组即暂时放下普选的宣传，向群众讲解互助合作政策，群众情绪很高，有四十六户自动组成八个互助组，订出增产计划，推动了全乡的生产。在这个基础上，工作组再向群众说明政权与生产的关系，号召群众积极参加普选，群众十分欢迎。背村乡在人口调查、选民登记时，占用群众两天时间，选民大会占用不足一天时间（早晨约九点钟开始，下午三时结束），做到了中央选举委员会的规定。
    这几个乡经过普选，广大群众的参政热情大大提高了，某些群众埋头生产不问政治的倾向扭转了，群众更加分清了敌我界限，使敌人更加孤立。乡人民代表大会的威信树立起来，干部与群众的关系更加密切，某些地区村与村之间的隔阂也得到解决。如湖边乡上村干部胡大炎和农民协会委员胡家明在土地改革复查中换田肥己，侵吞斗争果实，对群众作威作福。这次对他们进行了尖锐的批评，他们检讨了错误，并根据群众的意见处理了换田和斗争果实，干部和群众很满意。石如村为着与下村争一付锣鼓（共同的斗争果实），存在着很深的隔阂，经过普选的民主教育，问题也得到解决。特别是因为发扬了民主，群众对人民政府和干部已敢于积极地提出批评。群众说：“这以后政府的工作更好推行了，群众的困难也更容易解决了。”
