    Miao Children in Haigshan Village, Weining County, Get the Opportunity to Study Culture
    A letter from Yang Chengyuan, a reader in Weining County, Guizhou Province: After liberation, the Miao people of Haigshan Village, Yuduo Township, Seventh District of Weining County, became masters of their own affairs, improved production, and improved their lives. They urgently requested the establishment of schools so that Miao children could learn culture. In the winter of 1951, with the help of the District People's Government, the village farmers' association organized the masses of the village to build a school. The local Miao farmers actively participated in the labor. After twenty days of intense work, two school buildings were completed. Miao children happily entered the school, and Miao man Zhang Zhiming became the school teacher.
    When it comes to studying, the people of Haigshan Village can't forget the persecution of the Miao people by the vicious pseudo-township chief Lu Yachao (executed) in the name of running a school before liberation. At that time, bandit Lu recruited Miao youths from various villages to "study," but in reality, he forced them to do unpaid hard labor. People were terrified when they heard that the township chief was asking them to "study." Those who were unwilling to "study" had to endure bandit Lu's extortion and pay a sum of money. Wang Zhenggang and Zhu Liqing in Haigshan Village were caught and beaten severely by bandit Lu because they were unwilling to do hard labor at that time. Both of their families could not afford to pay the money, so bandit Lu sent more than twenty people to their homes to eat and drink for two days. At that time, bandit Lu also used this incident to threaten the villagers, saying: "Whoever has a son who does not 'study' will have people brought to his house to eat and drink." At that time, a saying was popular among the people of Haigshan Village: Better to pay money than to "study."
    The days of disaster for the people of Haigshan Village are gone forever. Now, there are more than fifty Miao children in the village school happily studying and playing games. In the second semester of last year, the Weining County People's Government's Culture and Education Section changed this school to a public primary school. The villagers were very happy and said: Chairman Mao has given our Miao children the happiness of studying.

### 威宁县海格山村苗民子弟得到了学习文化的机会

专栏：读者来信摘要

    威宁县海格山村苗民子弟得到了学习文化的机会
    贵州省威宁县读者杨成原来信：威宁县七区雨朵乡海格山村苗族人民在解放后当家作了主人，提高了生产，改善了生活，迫切要求兴办学校，让苗民子弟学习文化。一九五一年的冬季，在区人民政府的帮助下，该村农民协会组织了全村群众兴工修建学校。当地苗族农民都积极参加劳动。经过了二十天紧张的工作，两座校舍落成了。苗族儿童都高兴地入了学，苗民张志明担任了学校的教师。
    提起念书的事，海格山村的群众都忘不掉解放前恶毒的伪乡长禄亚超（已枪决）借办学校为名对苗族人民进行的迫害。那时禄匪在各村招收苗民青年去“读书”，而实际上却是强迫他们去做无偿的苦役。人们一听说乡长让他们去“读书”时，都吓得发抖。不愿意去“读书”的，就得甘受禄匪的敲榨，拿出一笔钱来。海格山村王正钢、朱礼清就因当时不愿去作苦工受罪，而被禄匪捉去痛打。他们两家都出不起钱，禄匪就派了二十多个人到他们家里吃喝了两天。当时，禄匪还用这件事威胁全村群众说： “谁家有儿不‘读书’，就要带人到他家去吃喝。”当时，在海格山村的人们中流行着一句谚语：宁可出钱，不愿“读书”。
    海格山村人们的灾难的日子一去不返了。现在村里的学校已有五十多个苗家儿童在愉快地读书、游戏。去年下学期，威宁县人民政府文教科把这个学校改为公办小学。全村群众都十分高兴，他们说：毛主席让我们苗家子弟也得到了读书的幸福。
