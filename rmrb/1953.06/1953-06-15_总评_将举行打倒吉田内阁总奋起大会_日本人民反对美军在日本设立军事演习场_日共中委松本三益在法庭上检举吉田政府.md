Xinhua News Agency, June 14th: Tokyo Dispatch: The General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (abbreviated as "Sohyo"), the largest labor union organization in Japan, is preparing to hold a general uprising rally in mid-June to overthrow the Yoshida Cabinet, focusing on the struggle of the people of Uchinada Village in Ishikawa Prefecture against the establishment of a firing range by the U.S. military.

At a meeting of councilors (the "councilors" are equivalent to directors) held by "Sohyo" on May 20th, the issue of the anti-military base struggle in Uchinada Village and other places was discussed. The meeting unanimously agreed that: "This issue is not just a problem for Uchinada Village or Mt. Asama, but a common problem related to 700 military bases across the country. If it is not resolved, the war policy cannot be broken. Therefore, while demanding wage increases and opposing corporate 'rationalization,' we must carry out the struggle to remove military bases." The meeting also decided to do everything possible to carry out the struggle to remove military bases.

Following this, "Sohyo" called on all its affiliated units to: "Launch a peaceful movement to remove military bases. At the same time, expand wage increases and other various movements according to the specific situation, and launch a strong struggle."

"Sohyo" has decided to hold a general uprising rally in mid-June to overthrow the Yoshida Cabinet in response to the development of the anti-military base movement in various regions, and to launch a large-scale struggle against the Yoshida government's acceptance of the U.S. "Mutual Security Agency Aid," against rearmament, against the forced takeover of Uchinada Village, and to demand the removal of military bases.

Xinhua News Agency, June 14th: Tokyo Dispatch: The people of Uchinada Village in Ishikawa Prefecture, with the support of the Japanese working class and the people of the whole country, are persisting in their struggle against the Yoshida government's forced conversion of Uchinada Village into a U.S. military firing range.

Despite the fierce opposition of the people of Uchinada Village and the angry protests of the broad masses of people across the country, the Yoshida government reiterated on the 12th its decision to designate Uchinada Village as a permanent firing range for the U.S. military, and stipulated that residents of Uchinada Village must remove all their fishing boats and houses from the firing range area by the evening of the 14th. In order to ease and divide the struggle of the people of Uchinada Village, the Yoshida government deliberately announced that it would distribute part of the compensation paid by the U.S. military for past use of Uchinada Village to the residents of Uchinada Village.

However, the Yoshida government's high-handed measures and divisive conspiracies have failed to soften the struggle of the people of Uchinada Village to defend their homeland and livelihood. They are taking measures to resist the Yoshida government's forced takeover of Uchinada Village by force. The entire village has mobilized to build bomb shelters so that they can continue their struggle after the U.S. military begins firing practice on the 15th. The struggle of the people of Uchinada Village continues to receive enthusiastic support from the broad masses of the Japanese people. More than 300 members of unions such as the National Railway Workers' Union and the All-Japan Electrical Industry Workers' Union held a rally at Kanazawa Railway Station on the 13th, and the meeting marched in procession to Uchinada Village to demonstrate their firm support for the just struggle of the people of Uchinada Village. On the 12th, 300 members of the Hokuriku Railway Workers' Union, who decided to refuse to transport military supplies for the U.S. military, demonstrated at the U.S. military firing range in Uchinada Village, shouting slogans such as "Yankees go home!" The Japan Teachers' Union, which is holding a national convention, also donated money on the 13th to support the struggle of the people of Uchinada Village.

The Japanese Communist Party's central organ newspaper, "Akahata," published an editorial as early as May 30th, calling on the Japanese people to support the struggle of the people of Uchinada Village. "Akahata" pointed out: The struggle in Uchinada Village is not only a struggle against the reactionaries in Ishikawa Prefecture, but a struggle against the American and Japanese reactionary groups that rule Japan. Therefore, all forces opposing the Yoshida government and rearmament must regard it as a concentrated expression of the struggle across the country to demand the removal of military bases, stop rearmament, and overthrow the Yoshida Cabinet, and give it support.

Xinhua News Agency, June 14th: Tokyo Dispatch: Simultaneously with the struggle against the U.S. military's forced occupation of Uchinada Village in Ishikawa Prefecture as a firing range, the Japanese people are continuing to launch strong protest movements against the plan of the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries to establish military training grounds in Mt. Asama and Mt. Myogi in Nagano Prefecture and Gunma Prefecture.

On June 7th, Nagano Prefecture held a prefectural people's protest rally. The rally was attended by 5,000 representatives and masses from many labor unions, agricultural organizations, and women's organizations in Nagano Prefecture. Banners with slogans such as "Defend our homeland Mt. Asama," "Resolutely oppose the establishment of a training ground on Mt. Asama!" and "Yankees go home!" fluttered in the wind at the venue. Amid the participants' passionate emotions, representatives of various political parties and organizations unanimously expressed their determination to fight to defend Mt. Asama regardless of political parties or factions.

Prior to this, Nagano Prefecture had held a conference on May 27th attended by more than 400 representatives from workers', farmers', and cultural organizations. The conference resolved that all organizations attending the conference would form a prefectural-scale organization—the "Alliance Against the U.S. Military Turning Mt. Asama into a Training Ground"—and resolved to launch a large-scale signature protest movement. On the same
day, the Nagano Prefectural Assembly also unanimously passed a resolution opposing the U.S. military's occupation of Mt. Asama.

On June 8th, 150 representatives from Gunma Prefecture lodged a serious protest with the U.S. Far East Command Headquarters in Yokohama, opposing the U.S. military's establishment of military training grounds in the Mt. Asama and Mt. Myogi areas. The representatives also handed over a signature book with 30,000 signatures opposing the U.S. military's establishment of training grounds to the U.S. military authorities.

Because the U.S. military's use of Mt. Asama as a training ground will disrupt the academic research work of the Earthquake Research Institute of the University of Tokyo, 50 student representatives from the University of Tokyo also lodged a strong protest with the Yoshida government's Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the 6th.

Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: Tokyo Dispatch: When the Tokyo District Court began illegally interrogating Matsumoto Mitsuyoshi, a member of the Japanese Communist Party Central Committee who was arrested on May 13th, on the 6th, Matsumoto Mitsuyoshi waged a resolute struggle in court. He stood up at the beginning to protest, saying: The court's trial this time is unconstitutional. He accused the 200 armed police officers densely deployed inside and outside the court, saying: "Today's security inside and outside the court is a kind of violence and suppression." At the same time, he protested that the court authorities violated legal regulations by not giving him the indictment before the trial began.

Matsumoto Mitsuyoshi forcefully exposed the "reasons for prosecution" fabricated by the authorities. He pointed out: The intention of "rectifying" the leading cadres of the Japanese Communist Party at that time was to help the United States invade Korea and suppress the Japanese Communist Party, which defends peace. He emphasized: "This trial is clearly a political conspiracy by the Yoshida government. I want to accuse the Yoshida government to the masses." Matsumoto Mitsuyoshi demanded his immediate release. However, the judge announced the continued compulsory detention of Matsumoto Mitsuyoshi based on the "Group Regulation Ordinance," which had already expired.

Finally, Matsumoto Mitsuyoshi solemnly announced: "I am very dissatisfied with this reason for detention, and I will fight to the end!" Matsumoto Mitsuyoshi's speech was applauded and supported by the masses in the audience.

    【新华社十四日讯】东京消息：日本最大的工会组织日本工会总评议会（简称“总评”）正以石川县内滩村人民反对美军建立打靶场的斗争为中心问题，准备在六月中旬举行打倒吉田内阁总奋起大会。
    “总评”在五月二十日举行的评议员（“评议员”相当于理事）会议上讨论了内滩村等地反军事基地斗争的问题。会议一致认为：“这个问题不单是内滩村或浅间山等地的问题，而是与全国七百处军事基地有关的有共同性的问题。如果不予以解决，就不能打破战争政策。因此，在要求提高工资和反对企业‘合理化’的同时，必须进行撤除军事基地的斗争。”会议并决定要尽一切力量进行撤除军事基地的斗争。
    接着，“总评”就号召所属各单位：“发动撤除军事基地的和平运动。同时，并按照具体情况扩大提高工资和其他各种运动，展开强有力的斗争。”
    “总评”确定适应各地反对军事基地运动的展开，在六月中旬举行打倒吉田内阁总奋起大会，大规模展开反对吉田政府接受美国“共同安全署援助”、反对重整军备、反对强制接收内滩村，及要求撤除军事基地的斗争。
    【新华社十四日讯】东京消息：日本石川县内滩村的人民正在日本工人阶级及全国人民的支援下坚持反对吉田政府强制将内滩村变成美军打靶场的斗争。
    吉田政府不顾内滩村人民的激烈反对和全国广大人民的愤怒抗议，竟在十二日重申将内滩村划作美军的永久打靶场的决定，并限定内滩村居民将他们所有的渔船和房舍在十四日晚以前一律移出打靶场区域。吉田政府为了缓和与分化内滩村人民的斗争，故意宣布它将把美军因过去使用内滩村所付出的一部分损失赔偿费发给内滩村居民。
    但是，吉田政府的高压手段和分化阴谋都未能软化内滩村人民为保卫自己的乡土和生计而进行的斗争。他们正在采取措施，反抗吉田政府用武力强制接收内滩村。全村人民已动员起来修建避弹所，以便美军在十五日开始打靶之后继续坚持斗争。内滩村人民的斗争正继续得到日本广大人民的热情支持。国营铁道工会和全日本电气产业工会等工会的会员三百多人十三日在金泽火车站举行集会，会议并列队到内滩村举行示威游行，表示坚决支持内滩村人民的正义斗争。在十二日，决定拒绝给美军运输军事物资的北陆铁道工人工会的会员等三百人曾到内滩村美军打靶场示威，他们高呼着“美国佬滚回去！”的口号。正在举行全国大会的日本教职员工会也在十三日捐款支援内滩村人民的斗争。
    日本共产党中央机关报“赤旗报”早在五月三十日就已发表社论，号召日本人民支持内滩村人民的斗争。“赤旗报”指出：内滩村的斗争不仅是对石川县反动派的斗争，而是对统治日本的美国和日本反动集团的斗争。因此，一切反对吉田政府和重整军备的力量，必须把它当作全国各地要求撤除军事基地、停止重整军备和打倒吉田内阁的斗争的集中表现而予以支援。
    【新华社十四日讯】东京消息：与反对美军强占石川县内滩村为打靶场的斗争同时，日本人民正继续展开强烈的抗议运动，反对美、日反动派企图在长野县和群马县的浅间山和妙义山设立军事演习场的计划。
    六月七日，长野县举行了县民抗议大会。参加大会的有长野县许多工会，农业团体和妇女团体的代表和群众五千人。写着“保卫乡土浅间山”、“坚决反对在浅间山设立演习场！”、“美军滚回去！”等口号的旗帜在会场上迎风招展。在与会者激昂的情绪中，各政党和团体的代表都在会上一致表示要不分政党派别，为保卫浅间山而斗争。
    在此以前，长野县曾在五月二十七日举行过一次有工人、农民、文化团体的代表等共四百多人参加的大会。大会决议由所有出席大会的团体成立一个全县规模的组织——“反对美军变浅间山为演习场同盟”，并决议发动大规模的签名抗议运动。在同
    一天，长野县县议会也一致通过了反对美军占用浅间山的决议。
    六月八日，群马县的代表一百五十人向设在横滨的美国远东军司令部提出严重抗议，反对美军在浅间山和妙义山地区设立军事演习场。代表们并把有三万人签名的反对美军设立演习场的签名簿交给美军当局。
    由于美军以浅间山为演习场将破坏东京大学地震研究所的学术研究工作，东京大学的学生代表五十人也在六日向吉田政府外务省提出强硬抗议。 【新华社讯】东京消息：东京地方裁判所在六日开始非法审讯五月十三日被逮捕的日共中央委员松本三益时，松本三益在法庭上进行了坚决的斗争。他在一开始就站起来抗议说：裁判所这次开庭审判是违反宪法的。他指责密布在法庭内外的二百名武装警察说：“今天法庭内外的警卫是一种暴力和镇压。”同时，他抗议法庭当局违反法律规定，在开庭以前没有把起诉书交给他。
    松本三益有力地揭露了当局捏造的“起诉理由”。他指出：当时“整肃”日共领导干部的意图就是想要帮助美国侵略朝鲜，镇压保卫和平的日本共产党。他强调声明：“这个审判显然是吉田政府的政治阴谋。我要向群众来检举吉田政府。”松本三益要求立即释放他。但是，法官竟根据已经失效了的“团体等规正令”宣布继续强制拘押松本三益。
    最后，松本三益严正地宣布：“我对这个拘押理由认为非常不满，我要斗争到底！”松本三益的发言受到旁听席上群众的鼓掌拥护和支持。
