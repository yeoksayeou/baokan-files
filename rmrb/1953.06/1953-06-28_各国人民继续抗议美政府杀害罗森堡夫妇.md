Xinhua News Agency, June 27th: People from various countries around the world continue to protest angrily against the U.S. government's crime of murdering the Rosenbergs.

    Polish Catholic writer Czynski, in an interview published in "Warsaw Life," said: "The heinous crime of the Washington rulers in murdering innocent people has deeply shocked me." He said that this crime has aroused protests from the broadest strata of people around the world. Those responsible for this crime have been placed in the most disgraceful position.

    The British "Daily Worker" received countless protest letters from all over Britain, denouncing the U.S. government's despicable crime of murdering the Rosenbergs. Peter Haimbu, a pastor from North Birmingham, said that the execution of the Rosenbergs was "a cruel and absurd murder." A housewife with three children, Jones, wrote in a protest letter: "When I heard the news of the execution of the Rosenbergs, I felt angry and heartbroken... We working people will not forget this, and I will fight more actively for peace and a better life for the people of all countries." Many readers also suggested establishing an international fund to help Sophie Rosenberg (Rosenberg's mother) and the two children of the Rosenbergs.

    In Austria, the International Fellowship of Resistance Fighters and Victims of Fascist Persecution and Imprisonment issued a statement on the murder of the Rosenbergs, saying that it was a challenge to world public opinion and that it trampled on all laws of justice and humanity.

    On the 22nd, people in Madras Province, India, held a demonstration outside the U.S. Consulate to protest against the murder of the Rosenbergs. Demonstrations or rallies were also held in Calcutta, India, and Dhaka, Pakistan.

    The Indonesian General Confederation of Trade Unions held a memorial meeting for the Rosenbergs on the 22nd. The meeting protested to Eisenhower and paid tribute to the heroic spirit of the Rosenbergs.

    The Burma Workers and Farmers Party issued a statement saying: "The U.S. government, ignoring the opposition of the people of the world, has actually murdered the Rosenbergs. This further proves the brutality of the U.S. government. The U.S. government, which keeps calling itself 'democratic,' can no longer conceal its barbarous and ferocious face."

    英国“工人日报”收到从英国各地寄来的无数抗议书，痛斥美国政府杀害罗森堡夫妇的卑鄙罪行。北明翰牧师彼特·海姆布说，对罗森堡夫妇的处死是“残酷的和荒谬的谋杀”。一个有三个孩子的家庭妇女琼斯在抗议信中写道：“当我听到处死罗森堡夫妇的消息时，我感到愤怒和痛心……我们劳动人民忘不了这件事，我要更积极地为和平与世界各国人民的美好生活而斗争。”许多读者并建议设立帮助索非·罗森堡（罗森堡的老母）和罗森堡夫妇两个小孩的国际基金。
    在奥地利，抵抗运动战士及受法西斯迫害与囚禁者国际联谊会就罗森堡夫妇被杀害事发表声明说，这是对全世界舆论的挑战，它蹂躏了一切正义和人道的法律。
    印度马德拉斯省的人民二十二日在美国领事馆外举行示威，抗议杀害罗森堡夫妇。在印度的加尔各答、巴基斯坦的达喀等地，都举行了示威游行或集会。

    缅甸工农党发表文告说：“美国政府不顾世界人民的反对，竟然杀害罗森堡夫妇。这事更加证明美国政府的残暴，口口声声自称为‘民主’的美国政府，已再不能掩盖它的野蛮凶恶的面目。”
