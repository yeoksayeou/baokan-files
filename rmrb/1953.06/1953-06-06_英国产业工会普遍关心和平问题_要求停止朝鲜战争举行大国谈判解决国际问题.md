Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 5th. Mayevsky published an article in "Pravda" on the 4th, discussing some results of the annual meetings held by the industrial unions of England, Scotland, and Wales in anticipation of the British Trades Union Congress. Mayevsky stated that this year's meetings were characterized by unprecedented clarity, reflecting important changes in the sentiments of general union members. Various aspects of the peace issue were the main agenda at most meetings.

    The Electrical Trades Union, the Foundry Workers' Union, and the South Wales Miners' Federation first called for immediate negotiations between the great powers to resolve outstanding international issues. Meetings of the Shop Assistants and Warehousemen's Union, the National Union of Public Employees, the Association of Scientific Workers, and the Union of Post Office Workers also passed resolutions calling for great power talks.

    The immediate cessation of the Korean War and the recognition of the legitimate rights of the People's China in the United Nations were also unanimous demands. The Scottish Trades Union Congress also made this demand. The Foundry Workers' Union meeting protested against the revival of West German militarism, reflecting the opinion of the broad masses of British working people.

    Another issue discussed at the meetings was the normal economic relations between East and West. The demand to eliminate obstacles to normal economic relations between Britain and the people's democracies was raised at the vast majority of meetings.

    The demands for the independence and autonomy of British policy and for the withdrawal of foreign troops from Britain were voiced more resolutely and forcefully on the platforms of the trade union meetings than ever before.

    A characteristic feature of the discussions on domestic policy issues at the current trade union meetings is a deeper understanding of the reasons for Britain's economic difficulties and the further decline in the living standards of the working people. At the trade union meetings, British workers expressed the need to significantly reduce war expenditure and increase wages. The necessity of improving working conditions and safety measures was also discussed very seriously at some meetings.

    Many workers at the trade union meetings sharply criticized the leaders of the right-wing Labour Party and trade unions, whose actions were contrary to the interests of the working class.

    Mayevsky also mentioned another characteristic of this year's trade union meetings: the British working class is increasingly aware that the solidarity of the international working class is a necessary condition for achieving peace and ensuring the vital rights of the working people.

    Regardless of the opposition of some members of the leadership, the Scottish Trades Union Congress passed a resolution calling on the British Trades Union Congress to adopt new methods to promote trade union unity and to convene a joint meeting of representatives of the World Federation of Trade Unions and the so-called International Confederation of Free Trade Unions as soon as possible to resolve the issue of unity. The Electrical Trades Union and the Foundry Workers' Union also made the same demands. An example of the reality of these demands is that the friendly relations between British workers and the working people of the Soviet Union and the people's democracies have been greatly strengthened.

    英国产业工会普遍关心和平问题
    要求停止朝鲜战争举行大国谈判解决国际问题
    【新华社五日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：马耶夫斯基四日在“真理报”上发表一篇文章，论述英格兰、苏格兰和威尔士各产业工会在英国职工大会前夕举行的年会的一些结果。马耶夫斯基说，今年会议的特点空前的鲜明，这些会议反映出一般工会会员情绪的重要变化。有关和平问题的各个方面是大多数会议上的主要议程。
    电气工会、翻砂工人工会和南威尔士矿工联盟首先要求大国间立刻进行谈判，以解决悬而未决的国际问题。店员与送货工人联合会、全国公务员工会、科学工作者协会和邮政工人联合会的会议也通过决议，要求举行大国会谈。
    立即停止朝鲜战争并承认人民中国在联合国的合法权利也是大家一致的要求。苏格兰职工大会也提出了这个要求。翻砂工人工会会议抗议西德军国主义的复活，这反映了广大英国劳动人民的意见。
    在会议上讨论的另外一个问题是东西方的正常经济关系。在绝大多数的会议上都提出了这个要求，就是消除英国与各人民民主国家间正常的经济关系的障碍。
    要求英国政策的独立自主以及要求外国军队撤出英国的主张，在各工会会议的讲台上讲得比以往更加坚决有力了。
    在目前的各工会会议上，讨论内政政策问题时的一个特点是：对于英国经济困难和劳动人民生活水平进一步下降的原因有了更深刻的了解。在各工会会议上，英国工人表示有必要大大削减战争开支并提高工资。在有一些会议上还非常严肃地讨论了改进劳动条件和安全措施的必要。
    许多工人在各工会会议上尖锐地抨击右翼工党和工会的领袖，这些领袖的行动是违反工人阶级的利益的。
    马耶夫斯基还提到今年工会会议的另一个特点：英国工人阶级越来越了解到，国际工人阶级的团结是取得和平并确保劳动人民的切身权利的必要条件。
    苏格兰职工大会不顾领导机构一部分人的反对，通过一项决议，要求英国职工大会采取新的办法来促成工会团结，并早日召开世界工会联合会和所谓国际自由工会联合会的代表的联席会议，来解决团结问题。电气工会和翻砂工人工会也提出了同样的要求。这些要求的现实性的例证就是：英国工人和苏联与人民民主国家劳动人民的友好联系是大大地加强了。
