Opinions on Improving Leadership in Handicraft Production
        By the People's Government of Xinxiang City

    Xinxiang City's handicraft industry comprises twelve sectors and thirty groups. Currently, only 39% are operating normally; the rest face varying degrees of challenges. In terms of production and operation, they can be broadly categorized into three types: First, those with relatively good production and operation, generally without significant problems, include ten groups such as blacksmiths, stationery, bamboo crafts, leather, and laundry/dyeing; second, those whose production and operation are not very good but can be maintained with their own efforts or slight assistance, including eleven groups such as rope spinning, copper welding, weaving, and cotton ginning; third, those with poor production and operation, facing serious difficulties, requiring active effort or appropriate support, including nine groups such as woodworking, milling, weaving, repair, engraving, and knitting. Some of these have been replaced by modern industry or need to reduce production, switch to other trades, or close down. However, even within the first category, some, such as the dyeing workshops in the laundry/dyeing group, are currently facing considerable difficulties; and within the third category, some are still producing quite well, such as the thorn bush fence weavers in the weaving group.

    Generally, the reasons for better production and operation are as follows: First, implementing the policy of serving rural areas and meeting the needs of the broad masses, resulting in product sales and normal production. For example, bamboo and wood industries making cages and farm tools, stationery industries making pens and inks, blacksmiths making farm tools, as well as rope spinning, leather making, thorn bush fence weaving, clay pot firing, and tile basin firing, currently all face a situation of supply falling short of demand. Second, sufficient funds enabling self-reliance, relatively normal labor-capital or master-apprentice relationships, allowing production to continue even in the off-season. Third, high product quality, good reputation, or changing the bad habit of adulteration, leading to a gradual increase in turnover.

    Handicraft households or industries with poor production and operation, besides seasonal factors, face the following reasons:

    First, incorrect production orientation, failing to earnestly implement the policy of serving rural areas and meeting the needs of the broad masses, resulting in sluggish sales, difficulty in clearing inventory, and difficulty in switching to other trades. This is the main reason for poor production.

    Second, some handicraft products have high costs and low quality, affecting sales. There are two reasons for low quality: one is a poor technical foundation; the other is cutting corners. For example, the eleven chalk making businesses had the best sales last year, with supply falling short of demand. After the new year, under the support of the speculative idea of "hurrying for quick profit," they used inferior gypsum, which reduced quality, and sales began to decline.

    Third, some handicraft households have low operating enthusiasm, workers have low production enthusiasm, and labor-capital and master-apprentice relationships are abnormal.

    Fourth, financial difficulties, especially for those "struggling households" (i.e., households with very little capital, relying on borrowing to turn over), who can barely manage during the peak season but collapse during the off-season.

    Fifth, after state-owned companies implemented business accounting, they feared inventory accumulation and reduced processing orders compared to the past. Many handicraft businesses in Xinxiang City mainly rely on processing orders, with great blindness. Now that processing has tightened, it has had a significant impact on them. If necessary support is not provided to handicraft industries beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood, shutdowns will continue to occur in large numbers.

    Sixth, lack of raw materials. The raw materials needed by the city's major handicraft industries mostly rely on supply from trust companies. Now that trust company businesses and organizations are shrinking, they have no time to supply, thus depriving handicraft production of a supporting force.

    From the above situations, the problems existing in the handicraft industry are quite serious. The occurrence and existence of these problems, in addition to seasonal patterns and the industry's own poor management, are also due to the Xinxiang City People's Government neglecting active leadership in the handicraft industry. For future work, our opinions are:

    First, we must improve leadership in handicraft production. The Xinxiang City Industry Bureau should establish a handicraft section as soon as possible to specifically manage handicrafts. The Municipal Finance Committee should also regularly understand the situation of handicrafts and regularly study the problems in handicraft production. The districts should devote more effort to handicrafts, taking the leadership of handicraft production as their main or even central task. There should be a clear division of labor between the city and the districts in leading handicraft production. Cadres sent by various municipal departments to various industries to conduct handicraft work should be managed under the unified leadership of the district committee and district government, overcoming the chaotic phenomena of the past where each acted independently, without contact or cooperation. At the same time, in handicraft work, we must clarify the policy of centering on production, doing a good job in production to get through the off-season. The resolution of labor-capital relations, master-apprentice relations, and other issues should all start from the goal of doing a good job in production. Currently, some industries have excessively long study times and too many meetings, affecting production, and this situation must be improved.

    Second, vigorously implement the policy of handicraft production facing the broad masses, facing rural areas, improving quality, reducing costs, and self-production and self-sales, earnestly reversing the passive mood of some handicraft households relying on the government and waiting for the peak season, and criticizing the passive sabotage or attempts to mistreat and retaliate against workers and apprentices by some handicraft capitalists. Last winter, many industries went deep into market towns to develop business, contacted rural supply and marketing cooperatives, and sought fixed customers, achieving many successes. Their experiences should be well summarized and promoted. Other ideological concerns of handicraft workers should also be appropriately addressed through education, gradually dispelling them. The Federation of Industry and Commerce should do more work in this regard.

    Third, organize handicraft production cooperatives in a guided and steady manner. Xinxiang City has already organized eleven handicraft production cooperatives, with the largest having nearly a hundred members. Two cooperatives are already using electric motors (weaving cloth and socks). However, there are still many problems within the cooperatives. Some have poor sales and product accumulation, leading to abnormal production; others have disorganized structures and lack of systems, making it impossible to maintain production, and two have collapsed. Therefore, we must rectify these handicraft production cooperatives to gradually develop them normally. After the rectification work is completed and a foothold is established, we should develop them in a guided, focused, and controlled manner.

    Fourth, strengthen the work of the handicraft trade union, educate workers and apprentices to correctly handle labor-capital, employer-employee, and master-apprentice relationships, and pay attention to doing a good job in production. Although labor-capital and master-apprentice relationships are not as tense as in the past, they are still prominent in some industries and individual households and should be resolved in production. Incidents of retaliation against workers and mistreatment of apprentices should be handled properly. Most labor contracts have expired and should also be revised in conjunction with production, in discussions of production and business development, and should not be done separately from production. For those industries and handicraft households that are currently in the off-season and have poor production and operation, we should concentrate our efforts to get through the off-season and prevent workers and apprentices from becoming unemployed.

    Fifth, effectively solve the specific problems in handicraft production, and we must correctly implement the policy of appropriately supporting and developing handicrafts based on needs and possibilities. First, the issue of processing orders. The Municipal Finance Committee and the Industry and Commerce Section should convene various companies and relevant processing departments to specifically study and determine this, overcoming the idea of some companies being unwilling to process after asset verification. For some industries or handicraft households that do not have fixed processing arrangements with companies, the Federation of Industry and Commerce can help find ways to introduce customers. Second, the issue of loans. Banks should calculate loan terms based on specific circumstances, and they should not be shortened too much, and loan procedures should be simplified as much as possible. In terms of loan recipients, necessary support should be provided to households with production difficulties (but this does not mean that loans should be given to those with no prospects who cannot repay them). To help handicraft workers get through the off-season, banks should allocate a certain amount of loans and release them in a timely manner. In addition, in order to fully grasp the situation, unify thinking and understanding, and ensure that loans are issued well, each district should establish a special organization under the leadership of the district committee, with the bank as the main body, and with the participation of the trade union, tax bureau, industry and commerce section, and Federation of Industry and Commerce, to be responsible for carrying out loan work. Third, the issue of raw materials. The trust company should still try to supply the raw materials needed by handicraft workers before it closes. After it closes, this task should be handed over to state-owned stores or cooperatives. In addition, joint purchasing and sales by handicraft workers should be supported. Fourth, resolutely implement the government's tax revenue policy. In general, handicrafts should mostly adopt the method of periodic and fixed-amount collection. Fifth, restrictions should not be placed on handicraft workers recruiting apprentices (but they should register with the Labor Bureau after recruitment). Those who are truly losing money in their businesses and cannot maintain them should be allowed to reduce production, dismiss employees, or close down, but dismissal must be carefully studied by all parties before dismissal, and workers who are dismissed should be rescued and found employment as soon as possible.

    关于改善对手工业生产领导的意见
        新乡市人民政府
    新乡市手工业共有十二个行业，三十个小组。目前能够正常生产的只占百分之三十九，其余的都或多或少地存在一些问题。从生产经营情况来看，大体可分为三种类型：第一类，生产经营较好，一般没多大问题的，有铁匠、文具、竹工、皮革、洗染等十个组；第二类，生产经营不甚好，但只要自己努力或稍加帮助就可维持的，有纺绳、铜焊、织布、弹花等十一个组；第三类，生产经营不好，困难较严重，需要积极努力或予以适当扶植的，有木工、磨房、编织、修配、刻字、针织等九组。其中有的已被现代工业所代替，或须紧缩生产、转业或歇业。但是，在第一类户中，如洗染组的染房，目前也相当困难；而在第三类户中，有些户目前生产还相当好，如编织组中的编荆笆户。
    生产经营较好的，大体有以下几种原因：一、贯彻了面向农村及适应广大人民需要的方针，产品打开了销路，生产能够正常进行。如竹木业中做笼做农具的，文具业中造笔墨的，铁工业中做农具的铁匠炉，以及纺绳、制革、编荆笆、烧沙锅、烧瓦盆等手工业，目前均有供不应求之势。二、资金充裕，能够自力更生，劳资或师徒关系比较正常，因而淡季依然能够维持生产。三、产品质量高，信用好，或者改变了掺假掺杂的恶习，营业额逐渐上升。
    生产经营不好的手工业户或行业，除季节关系外，则有以下几种原因：
    一、生产方向不对头，没有认真贯彻面向农村及适应广大人民需要的方针，因此销路不畅，收摊不易，转业困难。这是生产不好的主要原因。
    二、部分手工业产品成本高，质量低，影响销路。质量低也有两种情况：一种是技术基础差；一种是偷工减料。如粉笔业十一家，去年销路最好，供不应求，年后在“萝卜快了不洗泥”的投机经营思想支持下，采用劣质石膏，质量降低，销路开始发生了困难。
    三、部分手工业户经营情绪不高，工人生产情绪低落，劳资关系、师徒关系不正常。
    四、资金困难，特别是那些“干倒户”（即资金很少，依靠借贷周转的户），旺季尚能维持，淡季就倒腾不过来了。
    五、国营公司实行经营核算后，害怕积压资金，加工订货较过去紧缩了。新乡市许多手工业，主要靠加工订货吃饭，盲目性很大，现在加工一紧缩，对他们的影响很大。如果对有利于国计民生的手工业不予以必要的扶植，歇业现象必将继续大量发生。
    六、原料缺乏。全市主要手工业所需的原料，多数依靠信托公司供给，现在信托公司业务和机构都在收缩，无暇供应，因而使手工业生产失去了一个支持力量。
    从以上的各种情况来看，手工业中存在的问题是相当严重的。这些问题的发生和存在，除了季节规律和行业本身经营不善的原因以外，新乡市人民政府忽视了对手工业的积极领导也是一个重大原因。对于今后的工作，我们的意见是：
    第一、必须改进对手工业生产的领导。新乡市工业局最近即建立手工业科，专门管理手工业；市财委也应经常了解手工业的情况，定期研究手工业生产中的问题。区则应拿出更多的力量来搞手工业，要把领导手工业生产作为主要的甚至是中心工作。市与区在领导手工业生产上应有明确的分工，市级各部门派到各行业进行手工业工作的干部应经过区委、区政府，在区的统一领导下进行工作，克服过去各自为政，互不联系，互不配合的混乱现象。同时，在手工业工作中，必须明确以生产为中心的方针，搞好生产度过淡季。劳资关系、师徒关系及其他各项问题的解决，都应以搞好生产为出发点。目前有些行业的学习时间过长，开会过多，影响生产，这种情况必须加以改进。
    第二、大力贯彻手工业生产面向广大群众，面向农村，提高质量，降低成本，自产自销的方针，认真扭转某些手工业户依赖政府，等待旺季的消极情绪，批判某些手工业资本家消极怠工或企图虐待报复工人、学徒的行为。去冬不少行业深入集镇开展业务，联系农村供销社，找寻固定顾主，取得了不少成绩，对于他们的经验应该很好地总结推广。对手工业者的其他思想顾虑，也应针对具体情况进行适当的教育，逐渐加以解除。工商联合会在这方面应多作一些工作。
    第三、有领导地、稳步地组织手工业生产合作社。新乡市已经组织了十一个手工业生产合作社，社员最多者近百人，有两个社已经使用电动机（织布、织袜）。但社内问题还很多，有的是销路不好，产品积压，生产不正常；有的是组织紊乱，缺乏制度，已经不能维持生产，有两个已垮了台。因此我们必须对这些手工业生产合作社加以整顿，使其逐
    渐正常发展。在整顿工作告一段落占住阵地之后，
    再有领导、有重点、有控制地加以发展。
    第四、加强手工业工会的工作，教育工人、学徒
    正确处理劳资、雇佣和师徒关系，注意搞好生产。目前劳资和师徒关系虽不像过去紧张，但有些行业及个别户仍然很突出，应在生产中予以解决。对报复工人、虐待学徒的事件应妥善处理。劳资合同多数已经到期，也应结合生产，在讨论生产和开展业务中加以修订，不能脱离生产单独来搞。对那些正在淡季、生产经营不好的行业和手工业户，目前应集中力量，争取度过淡季，使工人学徒不要失业。
    第五、切实解决手工业生产中的具体问题，一定要正确贯彻根据需要与可能适当扶植发展手工业的方针。一、加工订货问题。由市财委、工商科召集各公司及有关加工部门具体研究确定，克服有些公司核资后不愿加工的思想。有些行业或手工业户，公司无固定加工者，可由工商联帮助寻找门路介绍主顾。二、贷款问题。银行在贷款期限上，应根据具体情况计算，不能缩得太短，贷款手续应尽量简便。贷款对象上，对生产有困难的户应予以必要的扶植（但不是说对毫无前途，贷出收不回的也要贷给）。为帮助手工业者度过淡季，银行应划出一定数量的贷款及时投放。此外，为了全面掌握情况，统一思想认识，保证贷款发放得好，各区应在区委领导下以银行为主，吸收工会、税务局、工商股、工商联等部门参加成立专门机构，负责贷款工作的进行。三、原料问题。手工业者所需要的原料，信托公司在结束之前仍应设法供应，结束之后应将此任务交给国营商店或合作社负责。此外，对手工业者的联购、联销应予赞助。四、坚决贯彻政府税收政策。在手工业一般应多采取定期、定额征收的办法。五、对手工业者招收学徒不要加以限制（但招收后应向劳动局备案）。对营业确实赔累，真正不能维持者应允许紧缩、解雇或歇业，但解雇之前必须经各方面慎重研究，工人被解雇之后应设法救济，并尽早安置就业。
