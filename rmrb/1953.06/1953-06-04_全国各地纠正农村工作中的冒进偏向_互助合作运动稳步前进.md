    Correction of Impetuous Deviations in Rural Work Nationwide
    Mutual Aid and Cooperation Movement Advances Steadily

    The agricultural mutual aid and cooperation movement throughout the country is progressing along a steady and healthy path. The blind and impetuous deviations in organizing farmers for mutual aid and cooperation from last autumn to this spring have now been largely corrected. After local newspapers published the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party's resolution on agricultural production mutual aid and cooperation and the instructions to Party committees at all levels on spring plowing production in late March, various localities conducted specific studies of the blind and impetuous situations in the mutual aid and cooperation movement in their respective regions. Most provinces, counties, and districts in the Northeast region convened meetings on agricultural production mutual aid and cooperation, and educated key members of the mutual aid and cooperation movement on how to correctly organize; in order to implement the spirit of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party's resolution and instructions, the Jilin Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party also ran a mutual aid and cooperation training class from April 12 to 18, training more than 340 county and district cadres. During the training period, the cadres' hasty and impetuous deviations in leading the mutual aid and cooperation movement were examined and criticized; everyone also studied methods to improve various types of mutual aid and cooperation organizations in the future. From April 9 to 12, the Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party convened a provincial conference of rural reporters and propagandists, which, in accordance with the spirit of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party's resolution and instructions, arranged for the promotion of the principle of voluntary mutual benefit in agricultural production mutual aid and cooperation, respecting farmers' land ownership, in order to stimulate farmers' enthusiasm for production. In order to correct the blind and impetuous deviations in the mutual aid and cooperation movement in the North China region, the North China Bureau of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party specifically convened a meeting of the persons in charge of the rural work departments of the provincial committees; after the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party's resolution on agricultural mutual aid and cooperation and the instructions to Party committees at all levels on spring plowing production were published, the North China Bureau notified all party members, cadres and relevant rural workers in the region to study the documents. The areas in North China where the blind and impetuous situation in the rural mutual aid and cooperation movement was more serious were mainly the four special districts of Handan, Dingxian, Changzhi, and Yuncheng, where the mutual aid and cooperation movement had developed rapidly in the past, and some villages (400 villages) in some counties (27 counties) under their jurisdiction. At present, North China has rectified the agricultural production cooperatives that were blindly organized from last autumn to this spring, and it is estimated that about a quarter of the agricultural production cooperatives that do not meet the requirements will be transformed into mutual aid teams. When correcting the blind and impetuous deviations in the mutual aid and cooperation movement, An’guo, Shahe and other counties in Hebei Province convened mutual aid and cooperation representative meetings and seminars, respectively. More than 10,000 farmers in Shahe and An’guo counties alone understood the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee and the People’s Government’s policy of organizing mutual aid and cooperation from the meetings and seminars, and eliminated their concerns about not daring to develop production. In many areas of the Central South region, the Communist Party's rural organizations, due to publicizing various production policies during the spring plowing period, and focusing on explaining to farmers the People's Government's protection of farmers' ownership of land and property and the voluntary and mutually beneficial policy of organizing mutual aid and cooperation, based on the local characteristics of shifting from social reform to production and construction, have improved farmers' enthusiasm for production. Various regions in East China, Southwest China, and Northwest China have also taken corresponding measures to address the blind and impetuous deviations in the mutual aid and cooperation movement. For example, the Qinghai Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party more thoroughly organized rural work cadres throughout the province to study the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party's documents on agricultural production mutual aid and cooperation; the Xikang Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party also ran mutual aid and cooperation training classes one after another; the Shandong Sub-bureau of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Guizhou Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party each issued instructions or convened special meetings to correct the blind and impetuous deviations in the local mutual aid and cooperation movement.

    The results of the implementation of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party's resolution on agricultural production mutual aid and cooperation and the instructions to Party committees at all levels on spring plowing production have greatly encouraged farmers' enthusiasm for production. After correcting the blind and impetuous deviations in Shahe and An’guo counties, Hebei Province, many villages' mutual aid teams actively sought ways to increase fertilizer and cultivate the land carefully. More than 220 mutual aid teams in ten villages in the first district of An’guo County purchased more than 170,000 jin of bean cake in ten days; the farmers in this county also newly organized more than 1,500 mutual aid teams and launched a production campaign. After correcting deviations such as violating the principle of farmers' voluntariness by putting livestock and farm tools into shares and returning them to the public in Quzhai Village, Changzhi County, Shanxi Province, the dull atmosphere in production since the beginning of spring has greatly changed, and farmers are generally plowing and harrowing spring land, drying seeds, and carrying out spring plowing; the mutual aid teams and agricultural production cooperatives in the village have also launched a large-scale production increase competition. Runan County, Henan Province, publicized the voluntary and mutually beneficial policies in mutual aid and cooperation and the policy of protecting middle peasants, and the county added more than 2,000 head of livestock and purchased more than 4,000 pieces of agricultural tools such as plows and drills. The Cheng Jialu mutual aid team in Honglian Township, Xishui County, Hubei Province, corrected the misuse of farm tools and stipulated reasonable usage methods. The team members not only added plows and hoes, but also painted three waterwheels with paint. Throughout the Southwest region, due to the widespread publicity of production policies and the correction of the phenomenon of attacking individual farmers, farmers have eliminated their worries about being "collectivized" and "equalized," and most have increased fertilizer application, and great achievements have also been made in water conservancy construction.

    According to the situation reflected by various localities, the issues that should be paid attention to in carrying out the mutual aid and cooperation movement at present are: First, some rural cadres have not studied the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party's documents sufficiently, so when correcting the shortcomings in the mutual aid and cooperation movement, they have not paid enough attention to making the policy of voluntariness and mutual benefit meet the masses, worrying that after farmers know the policy of voluntariness and mutual benefit, it will "hinder" the development of the movement. However, the experience of various localities in correcting shortcomings shows that whenever farmers truly understand this point, the mutual aid and cooperation movement has achieved steady development, while those who do not believe this point and have various doubts in their minds, although they are organized in form, are actually "organized individual work," and are even far inferior to individual work due to their lack of enthusiasm for production. Second, some rural workers adopt a perfunctory and irresponsible attitude when rectifying the blindly organized agricultural production cooperatives, and do not conscientiously help farmers solve the aftermath problems in accordance with the principles of fairness and rationality based on the actual situation. Although the shortcomings have generally been corrected in this way, they have left a certain negative impression in the minds of farmers, which also needs attention. Third, when improving the shortcomings in the mutual aid and cooperation movement, some rural workers do not calmly listen to the positive and negative opinions of various people on the mutual aid and cooperation movement, analyze them, appropriately correct the shortcomings, and retain the original good aspects to make the movement move forward; instead, they simply deny everything and "correct" everything, so they cannot meet the actual mutual aid and cooperation needs of farmers, and as a result, the movement tends to regress. Therefore, maintaining a calm and correct attitude and treating problems concretely is a very important thing in the road of mutual aid and cooperation.

    全国各地纠正农村工作中的冒进偏向
    互助合作运动稳步前进
    【新华社三日讯】全国各地的农业互助合作运动，正循着稳步健康的道路前进。去秋到今春，各地在组织农民互助合作中的盲目冒进偏向，目前已经基本上得到纠正。三月下旬，各地报纸刊载了中共中央关于农业生产互助合作的决议和关于春耕生产给各级党委的指示以后，各地都对本地区互助合作运动中盲目冒进的情况作了具体研究。东北区的多数省、县、区召开了关于农业生产互助合作的会议，对互助合作运动中的骨干分子，进行了怎样正确地进行组织起来的教育；中共吉林省委员会为贯彻中共中央决议和指示的精神，还在四月十二日到十八日开办了互助合作训练班，训练了县区干部三百四十多人。训练期内，检查并批判了各地干部在领导互助合作运动中急躁冒进的偏向；大家又研究了今后提高各种类型的互助合作组织的办法。中共黑龙江省委员会在四月九日至十二日召开了全省的农村报告员和宣传员代表会议，会议根据了中共中央决议和指示的精神，布置了宣传农业生产互助合作必须贯彻自愿互利的原则，尊重农民的土地所有权，以便发挥农民生产的积极性。华北区为纠正互助合作运动中盲目冒进的偏向，中共中央华北局曾专门召开了各省委员会农村工作部负责人的会议；华北局在中共中央关于农业互助合作的决议和关于春耕生产给各级党委的指示发表以后，曾通知全区党员干部和有关农村工作人员对文件进行学习。华北农村互助合作运动中盲目冒进情况比较严重的地区，主要是过去互助合作运动发展较快的邯郸、定县、长治、运城等四个专区，及其所辖的部分县内
    （二十七个县）的部分村庄（四百个村）。目前，华北全区已将去秋到今春盲目组织起来的农业生产合作社进行了整顿，估计约有四分之一左右不够条件的农业生产合作社将转变为互助组。河北省的安国、沙河等县，在纠正互助合作运动中的盲目冒进偏向时，曾分别召开了互助合作代表会议和座谈会。仅沙河、安国两县即有一万多农民，从会议和座谈会中明白了中共中央和人民政府组织互助合作的政策，消除了不敢发展生产的顾虑。中南区不少地区共产党的农村组织，由于在春耕期间宣传了各项生产政策，并根据当地由社会改革转向生产建设这
    一特点，着重向农民说明人民政府保护农民土地和财产的所有权和组织互助合作的自愿互利政策，提高了农民生产的积极性。华东区、西南区、西北区各地对互助合作运动中的盲目冒进偏向，也都作了相应的措施。如中共青海省委员会就较深入地组织了全省的农村工作干部学习了中共中央关于农业生产互助合作的文件；中共西康省委员会也先后开办了互助合作训练班；中共中央山东分局、中共贵州省委员会都分别发了指示或专门召开了会议，对当地互助合作运动中盲目冒进的偏向作了纠正。
    各地对中共中央关于农业生产互助合作的决议和关于春耕生产给各级党委的指示执行的结果，大大鼓舞了农民生产的积极性。河北省沙河、安国两县在纠正了盲目冒进的偏向以后，不少村子的互助组积极想法增加肥料，对土地精耕细作。安国县第一区十个村的二百二十多个互助组，曾在十天内增购了豆饼十七万斤；这个县的农民并且又新组织起来一千五百多个互助组，展开了生产运动。山西省长治县璩寨村在纠正了违背农民自愿原则将牲口、农具入股归公等偏向后，入春以来生产中的沉闷气象大为改变，农民普遍地犁耙春地，翻晒种子，进行春耕；村中的互助组也和农业生产合作社展开了大面积增产竞赛。河南省汝南县宣传了互助合作中的自愿互利和保护中农的政策，全县就增添了各种牲畜两千多头，购置了犁、耧等农具四千多件。湖北省浠水县红莲乡程家禄互助组纠正了农具滥用、规定了合理使用的办法，组员们不仅增添了犁、锄头，还把三部水车上了油漆。西南全区由于广泛地宣传了生产政策，纠正了打击单干农民的现象，农民消除了怕“归公”、怕“扯平”的顾虑，大部增施了肥料，兴修水利也得到很大成绩。
    根据各地反映的情况，目前在进行互助合作运动中还应注意的问题是：一、一部分农村干部对中共中央的文件研究学习的还不够，因此他们在改正互助合作运动中的缺点时，没有充分注意使自愿互利的政策和群众见面，顾虑农民知道自愿互利的政策后，会“妨碍”运动的发展。但各地在纠正缺点的经验中表明：凡是农民真正理解了这一点，互助合作运动就得到了稳步的发展，而农民不相信这一点并且心存各种疑虑的，虽然从形式上看是组织起来了，而实际上却是“组织起来的单干”，甚至由于他们没有积极生产的情绪还远不如单干。二、一部分农村工作者对盲目组织起来的农业生产合作社进行整顿时，采取马虎的不负责任的态度，不是认真地根据实际情况帮助农民本着公平合理的原则解决善后问题，这样缺点虽然一般地纠正了，但在农民思想中还留下了一定的不良印象，这也是需要注意的。三、还有一部分农村工作者在改进互助合作运动中的缺点时，不是冷静地去听取各种人物对互助合作运动正面与反面的意见，对此加以分析，既适当地改正缺点，又保留原来好的方面，使运动前进一步；而是简单地否定一切，一律去“纠正”，因此不能满足农民实际的互助合作要求，结果反使运动趋向后退。所以保持冷静正确的态度，具体地对待问题，是互助合作前进道路中十分重要的事情。
