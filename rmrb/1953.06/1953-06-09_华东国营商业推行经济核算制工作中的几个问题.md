East China State-Owned Commerce's work on several issues in promoting economic accounting.
Ai Zhongquan, Deputy Director of the East China Commercial Bureau

This year, the purchase and sales volume of state-owned commerce in East China accounts for approximately 35% of the nation's total. Cadres in the East China commercial sector fully recognize the importance of their responsibilities. On one hand, we have launched a struggle against bureaucracy, and on the other hand, we are implementing economic accounting to combine ideological and business development, so as to improve our work to the next level.

Under the leadership and support of the Party and the government, the work of establishing an economic accounting system in the state-owned commercial sector of East China is proceeding comprehensively and steadily in accordance with the regulations of the Central Ministry of Commerce. In practice, we feel that the following issues must be properly resolved in order to achieve the desired results:

I. Ideological Leadership in Promoting Economic Accounting

To implement economic accounting, it is first necessary to establish a correct economic accounting ideology among all state-owned commercial personnel. Everyone must be told why it is necessary and possible to implement economic accounting today. We must also conduct criticism and self-criticism, focusing on the main ideological obstacles, to unify everyone's understanding. Promoting economic accounting is a struggle between old and new ideas. We must criticize the supply system management thinking of the past in order to lay the ideological and mass foundation for implementing economic accounting. However, we still have some shortcomings in this work. First, we have done a poor job of positive education on economic accounting ideology. We have not comprehensively and correctly explained the meaning of economic accounting. Therefore, the majority of employees' understanding of economic accounting is only a concept, and some even have some misconceptions. Second, in opposing the supply system thinking, there has been a tendency to be too general. As a result, after the implementation of economic accounting, departmentalism and fear of responsibility have greatly increased. Because we did not anticipate this, a bias occurred in the department store system, which was the first to implement economic accounting, with blind compression of inventory, a desire for more fast-selling goods, less desire for general goods, and enthusiasm for promoting Shanghai goods but unwillingness to promote industrial products produced in small and medium-sized cities that meet the needs of the people. This approach not only does not conform to the principles of economic accounting, but also violates the purpose of commercial work to serve production and consumers. These biases have been basically overcome through criticism and education. However, thoroughly implementing economic accounting requires further efforts from us.

II. Steps and Methods for Promoting Economic Accounting

In the process of implementing economic accounting, the East China state-owned commercial system has consciously paid attention to three issues in terms of steps and methods:

I. Universally mobilize the masses for inspection and establish advanced operating systems on this basis. When state-owned commerce in the East China region began to implement economic accounting, the masses were mobilized to inspect shortcomings in the work, trace the causes, study improvement methods, and establish new operating systems to improve business management. Preliminary inspections have shown that the chaotic state of business management in state-owned commerce in the East China region is extremely widespread. Due to inaccurate accounting and blind management, serious situations such as discrepancies in accounts, loss of materials, reverse flow of goods, and simultaneous stockpiling and stock-outs are common. Economic accounting is precisely the system and method for promoting each enterprise unit to do detailed accounting, study business, and improve operations. Since the widespread launch of labor emulation campaigns in the East China commercial system last autumn, the masses have provided many practical and feasible rationalization proposals. The shortcoming is the lack of cultivation, summarization, and promotion. Now, after the implementation of economic accounting, enterprise units should further rely on employees to practice careful calculation. Therefore, everyone's demand for advanced operating systems and methods is even more urgent. At present, state-owned commerce in East China is focusing on cultivating typical examples and summarizing operating systems and methods for several types of wholesale stations and retail stores, and promoting them step by step, based on the universal mobilization of the masses for inspection, finding shortcomings, and tracing the roots.

II. Reasonably resolve the problems that occur in the implementation of economic accounting. Economic accounting transforms the internal allocation relationship between various professional systems into a contract supply relationship. Enterprise units in the same professional system are reorganized into purchasing and supply stations, wholesale stations, wholesale stores, or retail stores according to their business nature, so that each independently accountable enterprise unit can operate independently in accordance with national policies and laws. This requires that the entry, sale, transfer, cost burden, and price settlement of each item of goods be clearly defined with boundaries and responsibilities. Due to this major change, many problems will occur that cannot be foreseen at one time, nor can they all be solved at one time. This is reflected in: in terms of reasonable reserves and seasonal reserves of goods, how much should be reserved at which level of station or store; in terms of distinguishing the categories of goods and calculating various expenses, it is currently not completely accurate; in terms of price settlement, there are issues such as seasonal changes in prices, the scale of regional price differences, the mutual growth and decline of commodity turnover period and profits, the scale of profits, and the principles of profit distribution for stations and stores at all levels. These problems must be gradually resolved in the process of implementing economic accounting. The preliminary experience in East China is that these problems should be concentrated at the upper-level stations for processing, according to the spirit of state-owned commerce being responsible for production and the market, and the policies of the Party and the state, so as to reduce the difficulties of the majority of lower-level stations with many points and a wide area (of course, problems arising from the departmentalism and fear of responsibility of each station are not included). This is one of the important methods for smoothly and practically promoting economic accounting.

III. Close cooperation with banks is one of the important preconditions for promoting economic accounting. For commercial departments, it is necessary to determine correct indicators in accordance with the policies of the Party and the state—commodity circulation plans, capital quota, and profit delivery plans—change the internal allocation system to a contract supply system, supervise through bank loans and bank settlements, and use a combination of item-by-item accounting and comprehensive accounting—a combination of accounting for each business and accounting for the overall business of the enterprise unit—to regularly urge the progress of the enterprise unit. On the bank side, it should serve commercial operations and supervise state-owned commerce according to the tasks assigned by the state to state-owned commercial departments (specifically manifested in the various planning indicators of each state-owned commercial enterprise unit), give full play to the functions of the state bank, and promote the progress of socialist enterprises. Therefore, the common key issue for the National Bank and state-owned commercial departments in promoting the economic accounting system of state-owned commerce is the accuracy of various planning indicators. When state-owned commercial enterprise units began to implement economic accounting, the accuracy of various planning indicators was improved by fully mobilizing employees to discuss the plan. However, due to the inconsistency of ideological level and work level, the plans of various relevant enterprise units also affect each other, and the various planning indicators are still not very accurate and there are uneven phenomena. Therefore, after independently verifying funds and implementing allocation and liquidation, it is possible to cause the phenomenon of capital disconnection and affecting business. Of course, this abnormal situation is a situation during the transition period and can be gradually overcome. However, eliminating this disconnection phenomenon requires the relevant enterprise units to work hard separately in various aspects. In order to both prevent business disconnection from affecting the market and effectively implement the new system, the bank needs to adopt the method of "being active and checking" - making the financial turnover of state-owned commercial enterprises lively while carrying out supervision and inspection. The commercial department should adopt "diligent investigation and in-depth study" - regularly conduct planned inspections, deeply investigate the root of the disconnection and study improvement methods. If the National Bank or the state-owned commercial department conduct separately according to the agreed system in advance, and lack frequent close contact and mutual cooperation, it will be difficult to achieve the expected good results. State-owned commerce in East China did not grasp this link from the beginning, so there was once a number of disconnection phenomena, and now it is cooperating with the bank to solve this problem.

III. Combine the implementation of economic accounting with labor emulation

Economic accounting is a method of scientific management for state-owned enterprises. The superiority of economic accounting lies in its ability to establish correct work indicators, thereby establishing a responsibility system. The various planning indicators of any independently accountable unit must be based on policies, but only a complete system like economic accounting can perfectly reflect policy requirements and formulate correct indicators. This establishes the goal for labor emulation and ensures that labor emulation can be carried out regularly and persistently. Therefore, under the conditions of implementing economic accounting, labor emulation will further rise; and the development and rise of labor emulation will promote the better implementation of economic accounting. The implementation of economic accounting has opened up a broad road for labor emulation.

    华东国营商业推行经济核算制工作中的几个问题
    华东商业局副局长  艾中全
    今年华东国营商业的购销额，约占全国购销总额的百分之三十五。华东商业部门的干部，充分认识到自己的职责的重大。我们一方面展开了反对官僚主义的斗争，一方面实行经济核算制，使思想建设与业务建设结合进行，以便把工作水平提高一步。
    华东区国营商业部门建立经济核算制的工作，根据中央商业部的规定，在党和政府的领导与支持下，正在全面地稳步地进行。在实践过程中，我们感到有如下几个问题，必须很好地加以解决，才能使这一工作收到应有的效果。
    一、推行经济核算制的思想领导问题
    为了实行经济核算制，首先要在全体国营商业工作人员中树立起正确的经济核算的思想。要向大家讲清楚为什么今天必须而且可能实行经济核算制，并且要针对主要的思想障碍，开展批评与自我批评，统一大家的思想认识。推行经济核算制是一场新旧思想的斗争，必须批判过去经营中的供给制经营思想，才能为实行经济核算制打下思想基础和群众基础。但在这一工作中，我们还存在着若干缺点。第一，对经济核算制思想的正面教育做得很差，没有全面地正确地解释经济核算制的意义，因此广大职工对经济核算制的认识还仅仅是一个概念，甚至产生了一些错误的认识。第二，在反对供给制思想方面，有流于笼统之处。因此，开始实行经济核算制后，本位主义和怕负责的思想大大抬头。由于我们没有预见到这一点，以致在首先实行经济核算制的百货系统中，发生了盲目压缩库存，多要畅销货，少要一般货，热心推销上海货而不愿推销中小城市生产的适合人民需要的工业品的偏向。这种做法，不仅不符合经济核算制的原则，而且违反了商业工作为生产和消费者服务的目的。这些偏向经过批判与教育，基本上已经克服了。但是，彻底贯彻经济核算制，还有待我们作进一步的努力。
    二、推行经济核算制的步骤和方法问题
    华东国营商业系统在实行经济核算制过程中，在步骤、方法上，曾经有意识地注意了三个问题：
    一、普遍发动群众性的检查，并在此基础上建立先进操作制度。华东地区的国营商业开始实行经济核算制的时候，发动群众检查了工作中的缺点，并追寻原因，研究改进的办法，建立新的操作制度，以改善经营管理。初步检查所提供的资料，已说明华东区国营商业经营管理的混乱状态极为普遍。由于不算细账、盲目经营，账目不符、物资损失、货运倒流、一边积压一边脱销等严重情况普遍存在。经济核算制正是推动每一企业单位去算细账、钻研业务、改进操作的制度与方法。从去年秋季华东商业系统普遍展开劳动竞赛以后，群众曾提供了许多切实可行的合理化建议，缺点在于缺乏培养、总结与推广。现在实行经济核算制后，企业单位更应该进
    一步依靠职工，实行精打细算，因此，大家对于先进的操作制度与操作方法的要求更加迫切了。当前华东国营商业在普遍发动群众性的检查，找缺点，寻根源的基础上，着重于培植典型，总结几种类型的批发站与零售商店的操作制度方法，有步骤地加以推广。
    二、合理地解决贯彻经济核算制中所发生的问题。经济核算制把各专业系统之间的内部调拨关系变为合同供应的关系。同一专业系统的企业单位，各按照它的业务性质，分别改组为采购供应站、批发站、批发商店或者零售商店，使每一独立核算盈亏的企业单位，根据国家政策法令进行独立经营。这就必须对每一笔商品的进销交接、费用负担和价格结算都分清界限和责任。由于这一重大的改变，就会有不少在一时不能预见、在一时也不可能全部解决的问题发生。这表现在：在商品的合理储备和季节储备方面，在那一级的站或店应储备多少；在分别商品品类、计算各种费用方面，在目前还不能完全准确；在价格结算方面，则有价格的季节变化、地区差价的掌握尺度、商品周转期与利润的相互消长、利润的尺度和各级站和店的利润分配原则等等问题。这些问题都得在实行经济核算的过程中逐步求得解决。华东地区的初步经验是，对于这些问题，应根据国营商业对生产对市场负责的精神，党和国家的政策，把问题多集中于上级站去处理，使点多面广的多数下级站减少困难（当然由于各站本位主义和怕负责任而产生的问题不包括在内）。这是顺利切实推行经济核算制的重要方法之一。
    三、与银行密切合作，是推行经济核算制的重要的前提条件之一。在商业部门来说，应根据党和国家的政策，确定正确的指标——商品流转计划、资金定额和利润上缴计划等指标，改变内部调拨制为合同供应制，通过银行放款及银行结算的监督，运用逐一核算与全面核算相结合的方法——对每项业务的核算和对企业单位整体业务核算相结合的办法，经常督促企业单位的进步。在银行方面来说，根据国家对国营商业部门所规定的任务（具体表现在各个国营商业企业单位的各种计划指标上），为商业经营服务，并对国营商业进行监督，发挥国家银行的职能，促进社会主义企业的进步。因此，国家银行与国营商业部门在推行国营商业经济核算制工作上共同的关键问题，是各种计划指标的准确程度。国营商业的企业单位开始实行经济核算的时候，全面发动职工讨论计划，使各项计划指标的准确程度提高了，但由于思想水平和工作水平的不一致，各有关企业单位的计划又都相互发生影响，各种计划指标还不可能十分准确，并存在参差不齐的现象。因此，在独立核定资金和实行划拨清算之后，就有可能产生使资金脱节、影响业务的现象。当然，这种不正常情况是过渡期间的情况，是完全可以逐步克服的。但消除这方面的脱节现象，需要有关的企业单位从各个方面分别努力。为了既不使业务脱节影响市场，又能切实地贯彻推行新制度，在银行方面需要采取“边活边查”——一边使国营商业企业单位财务周转活泼，一边进行督促检查的方法，在商业部门则应采取“勤查深究”——经常作有计划的检查，深入追究脱节的根源并研究改进的办法。国家银行或国营商业部门如果各自按照事先约定的制度分头进行，而缺乏经常的密切联系与互相配合，便难达到预期的良好效果。华东各地的国营商业并不是一开始就抓住了这一环的，因此一度发生过若干脱节的现象，现在正与银行合作解决这个问题。
    三、实行经济核算制与劳动竞赛结合起来
    经济核算制是国营企业科学管理的方法。经济核算制的优越性，就在能够树立正确的工作指标，从而树立责任制。任何独立核算单位的各种计划指标，必须以政策为根据，但只有经济核算制这样完整的制度，才能完善地体现出政策要求，制订出正确的指标。这就为劳动竞赛树立了奋斗的指标，保证了劳动竞赛能经常的、持久的展开。所以，在实行经济核算制的条件下，劳动竞赛将进一步高涨起来；而劳动竞赛的发展和高涨，又将推动经济核算制的更好的贯彻。实行经济核算制就为劳动竞赛开辟了康庄大道。
