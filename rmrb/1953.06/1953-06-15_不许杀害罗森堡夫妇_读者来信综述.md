Readers from various regions continue to send letters protesting the U.S. ruling clique's plot to murder the Rosenbergs. Some of these letters are written in individual names, while others are written in the names of organizations or jointly signed by hundreds of people. They unanimously expressed their support for the Rosenbergs' unyielding struggle against persecution and demanded that the U.S. government immediately revoke the unreasonable sentence of murdering the Rosenbergs and restore their freedom. All the faculty and students of the Central Academy of Drama wrote in a letter: "The U.S. government has announced the execution of the Rosenbergs; and threatens the Rosenbergs to 'cooperate' with them, fabricating false confessions to deceive the people of the world. This shameless behavior of the U.S. rulers only makes the people of the world more aware of their hideous faces." Zou Xiyi from the Xianning Hot Spring People's Bank in Hubei wrote: "The Rosenbergs love peace and truth, but they were resented by the U.S. reactionaries and sentenced to death. I would like to pay my highest respect and condolences to the heroic Rosenbergs. Their heroic struggle is by no means isolated, and peace-loving people all over the world are supporting them." Twenty-three family members of employees of the Beijing Post Office jointly wrote in a letter: "In the name of mothers, we protest against the U.S. government's framing of innocent and kind Rosenbergs. This shameless act of the U.S. government is clearly intended to threaten the peace-loving American people. The wave of the peace movement is magnificent. If the U.S. reactionaries ignore the warnings of the people of the world and do not immediately stop the heinous conspiracy to murder the Rosenbergs, they will be met with even stronger opposition from the people of the world." Twenty-eight drivers from a certain unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army jointly wrote a letter expressing their determination to support the Rosenbergs' struggle. Liu Haishan from the Wuxi Municipal People's Government Construction Engineering Bureau wrote: "I have never written a letter to the newspaper, but the U.S. government's unreasonable sentence against the Rosenbergs has aroused my anger. Now I am writing to you, please allow me to protest against the U.S. government's reactionary act of murdering the Rosenbergs through the newspaper."

    不许杀害罗森堡夫妇
    ——读者来信综述
    各地读者继续来信抗议美国统治集团杀害罗森堡夫妇的阴谋。这些来信有的是以个人名义写的，有的是以机关团体名义或数百人联名写的。他们一致对罗森堡夫妇反抗迫害的不屈斗争表示支援；并要求美国政府立即撤销谋杀罗森堡夫妇的无理判决，恢复他们的自由。中央戏剧学院全体教职学员来信说：“美国政府宣布了要处死罗森堡夫妇；又威胁罗森堡夫妇和他们‘合作’，编造假供词，以欺骗全世界人民。美国统治者这种无耻行为，只有使全世界人民更加认清它们的狰狞面孔。”湖北咸宁温泉人民银行邹锡义来信说：“罗森堡夫妇热爱和平，热爱真理，竟遭到了美国反动分子的敌视而被判决死刑。我谨向英勇斗争的罗森堡夫妇致以崇高的敬礼和慰问。他们英勇的斗争决不是孤立的，全世界爱好和平的人们在声援着他们。”北京邮局二十三位职工家属联名来信说：“我们以母亲的名义抗议美国政府陷害无辜的、善良的罗森堡夫妇。美国政府这一无耻的勾当，显然是蓄意威胁和平的美国人民。和平运动的波澜是壮阔的，美国反动分子要是不顾全世界人民的警告，不立即停止杀害罗森堡夫妇的罪恶阴谋，它们必将遭到全世界人民更强烈的反对。”中国人民解放军某部二十八位司机联名写信表示，要努力支持罗森堡夫妇的斗争。无锡市人民政府建筑工程局刘海山来信说：“我从来没有写过信给报社，但是美国政府对罗森堡夫妇的无理判决，激起了我的愤怒。现在我写信给你们，请让我通过报纸抗议美国政府谋杀罗森堡夫妇的反动行为。”
