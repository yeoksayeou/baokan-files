Since its production began in 1950, the Second Northeast Copper Mine has completed its designated production tasks every year, but the quality of its products has been poor. Costs overran in both 1950 and 1951. The fundamental reason for these shortcomings was a lack of planned management and an inability to implement balanced production. Looking at the underground operations in February, June, and August of 1952, the mine's equilibrium rate was at its highest at 94.6 percent and at its lowest at 40 percent. Looking at the annual completion of mining tasks, June saw the most, completing 320 percent of the plan, and September the least, completing only 58 percent of the plan, a difference of more than five times. Due to the imbalance in production, the various operations could not closely coordinate. For example, ore preparation is mainly for mining, but the ratio of the highest month to the lowest month for ore preparation completion was 24 to 1, which directly affected the normal progress of mining operations. Secondly, mechanical equipment could not operate efficiently. For example, the aerial ropeway's ore transport volume experienced frequent shutdowns awaiting materials or large amounts of backlog due to the uneven ore output from the North Mountain pit. In addition, due to the unbalanced production, there were often rushes at the end of the month, machinery could not be repaired, and often broke down (last year, two fatal accidents occurred in the middle and late part of the month). Workers experienced uneven workloads, which damaged their health and caused many unnecessary troubles in the management of the pithead and workshops. Ultimately, the unbalanced production brought "terrible disasters" to the enterprise's management.

The harms of the above-mentioned unbalanced production aroused the attention of the mine's leading cadres, who were determined to change this situation. Under the instructions of the Nonferrous Metals Bureau and with the help of the work team, the mine began to implement balanced production in the pithead and workshops in the fourth quarter of last year. Since January of this year, the production situation has begun to change significantly. For example, in January of this year, the equilibrium rate of various major production tasks was above 96 percent, and in February it was also above 95 percent. Leading cadres had a clearer understanding and confidence in completing the national plan; workshop cadres and section/office staff, under the organization of balanced production, began to face the pithead and workshops, changing their past procrastination and shirking work style; some management systems, such as material and tool management, equipment maintenance, etc., also began to be strengthened. Here are some initial experiences that the mine has explored in the past few months:

I. Formulate practical and feasible operation plans for pithead teams

The characteristics of mine production are dispersed pitheads, unconcentrated mining areas, uneven distribution of ore veins, inconsistent grades, varying hardness of rocks, and many changes in production objects, etc. Therefore, mastering the changing laws of working conditions and doing a good job in operation planning is the basis for achieving balanced production.

In the past, leading cadres of the mine, fearing failure to complete the task, adopted the method of adding "insurance numbers" at each level when deploying plans, that is, the task assigned by the mine was higher than the plan set by the bureau, the tasks assigned by each pithead and workshop were higher than those set by the mine, and the group's plan was even higher than the pithead plan. As a result of this layer-by-layer increase, the group plan was often 30 to 50 percent higher than the plan set by the bureau. As a result, the group plan could not be completed, but the mine's plan was still completed. Such a plan could not play a guiding role in production and reduced workers' confidence in completing the plan.

When the mine first implemented balanced production, although it changed the method of setting plans by adding "insurance numbers" at each level, in order to complete the task in a balanced manner, it formulated a "loose at the beginning and tight at the end" plan based on the past situation of rush production with slack at the beginning and tight at the end. For example, in November 1952, the planned amount of sulfide ore processed in the first ten days was 26.16 percent of the total for the month, and the middle and last ten days were each 36.92 percent of the total for the month. Later, the mine's leadership emphasized the need to reverse this bias and focused on the plan at the beginning of the month. Taking the ore output of the Benshan pit in December of last year as an example, it was 2,820 tons in the first ten days, 2,100 tons in the middle ten days, and 1,620 tons in the last ten days. In this way, the plan changed again to "tight at the beginning and loose at the end." This also could not implement balanced production.

In order to correct the above-mentioned shortcomings, the mine began in January of this year to have the production section and the planning section jointly compile the operation plan based on the specific conditions of the pithead's geological conditions, rock hardness, and equipment capacity, after discussion with the directors of each pithead, and handed it over to the masses for discussion. Pithead cadres and workers have practical operational experience and are relatively clear about the laws of rock quality changes and ore grade levels. The plan is revised after mass discussion and then researched and synthesized by the production and planning sections to make it more practical. Finally, the entire mine plan after discussion is announced, requiring each group to formulate plans to ensure completion.

When discussing the plan, each group also discusses the methods to complete the task and what shortcomings should be overcome based on the conditions of the rock hardness of their own operating face, the efficiency of the rock drill, the transportation situation, and the technical level of the workers. Then, through self-reporting and public discussion, the final decision is made. After the actual progress of each day, each shift, and each face is determined, the operation plans for the group, work section, and pithead are compiled from the bottom up to form instruction charts for the group, pithead, and mine. In this way, the production plan determined by the group becomes the goal of each worker's struggle. They actively study ways to complete the task and solve the difficulties in the execution of the task, truly achieving a clear understanding. For example, once the statistician in the North Mountain pit forgot to fill in the chart, the workers went to ask about it, which shows that the workers are very concerned about their work progress and that the plan has been initially grasped by the masses.

II. Establish a dispatching organization to check the implementation of the plan

In order to check the implementation of the daily and shift operation plans of each pithead and ensure the implementation of balanced production, the mine established a dispatching office directly led by the mine director and, based on the characteristics of the mine's dispersion and difficulty in making comprehensive and timely checks, established a telephone reporting system. During the inspection, the reasons for not completing the plan are asked, and solutions are devised. If the pithead needs to solve it by itself, it is required to formulate a plan and time to solve it; if the section/office needs to solve it, the dispatching office also promptly checks the solution.

In the dispatching office's inspection of the plan implementation, if it is found that the work of certain units often hinders the normal progress of production, or that a certain operation often fails to complete the task, cadres are sent to the site to investigate and study. After mastering the situation, a mobile force is organized to go to the site to provide assistance according to the size of the problem until the problem is solved. This guarantees balanced production.

The mine's level of planning management is still very low, with many systems. Therefore, the phenomenon of no one being responsible or unclear responsibilities and the work style of procrastination and shirking responsibility are still very serious. The establishment of the dispatching organization has played a great role in overcoming the above-mentioned chaotic phenomena. For example, before December of last year, the supply of raw ore from the Benshan pit could not meet the needs of the concentrating plant, and some ore had to be supplied from the Xihai pit. However, upon hearing that the winding machine had broken down for no reason and no one was responsible for checking the extent of the damage and whether it could be repaired quickly, large trucks were hired for transportation regardless of cost. More than 20,000 tons were transported in four months, increasing the monthly product cost by 40 to 50 million yuan. It was not until the establishment of the dispatching office that this problem was discovered, and cadres were sent to investigate. It was then found that the reason for not being able to transport ore was that the hanging road had overturned, the road was bad, and some places were too steep. This section of the road was repaired in two and a half days.

Starting from the overall requirements of production, the mine discovers which departments are the weakest links at present and organizes forces in a timely manner to solve them. For example, in December of last year, the car dispatch rate was low, and four, five, or even seven or eight of the ten cars transporting concentrate were often shut down for repairs. After the implementation of balanced production and the establishment of the dispatching office, this weak link was discovered. Therefore, the leadership sent people separately to understand the situation from the drivers. It was found that some drivers were making trouble over wage issues, and coupled with a lack of systems and education, workers generally did not work and made excuses not to dispatch cars. Others were sent to the repair department to understand the situation and found that there was no organization or system within the department. Some workers wanted to hitch a ride in the middle of the journey, but were rejected by the drivers, and therefore held a grudge and deliberately did not give the cars spare parts for repair. More importantly, the director of the mechanical and electrical repair workshop had the wrong idea and understood the leadership's call for "auxiliary departments to face the pithead" as simply "facing the pit." Therefore, he did not process parts for the cars. Based on this situation, the mine's leadership dealt with them separately. In addition to ordering the director of the mechanical and electrical repair workshop to make a review to the transportation team, a processing system was established. The time for taking parts was specified when the task was assigned. If it was not delivered by the time, the dispatching office would urge it.

The mine also had errors in capital construction in the past, which caused imbalances in equipment. For example, the concentrating plant often had insufficient water, which seriously affected the concentrating work. The reason was that the reservoir was too small, and the pits could not frequently or simultaneously pump water to the reservoir. In order to carry out production according to plan, the mine stipulated that the reservoir must always maintain a water level of two meters deep, and the dispatching office inquired by telephone every two hours, which guaranteed the required amount of water for concentrating.

The dispatching office has indeed played a great role, making the work of cadres more in-depth. At the pithead, at least one pit director goes deep into the pit to check the work every shift and solves problems in a timely manner. If the task is not completed in the first shift, the second shift will be anxious, and the third shift will have to find a way to complete the task.

The head of the production section and the head of the planning section are on duty in the dispatching office, listening to reports. They can grasp the production situation on the site in a timely manner. If there is a major problem, they cannot but personally go down to the pit to solve it.

In the past, cadres emphasized the particularity of the mine and believed that the changes in rock hardness and ore quantity could not be predicted, so they were not very confident in completing the task. However, after the implementation of balanced production, they gained experience and realized that it is entirely possible to master the changes in natural conditions. Based on this understanding, planners and cadres further realized that it is entirely possible to do a good job in the mine's operation plan.

III. Established some systems from the formulation and implementation of operation plans

Established a division of labor and responsibility system for the supply of materials and tools: After the mine implemented balanced production, it prominently exposed the serious phenomenon of no one being responsible in the work of the technical supply department and the mechanical and electrical repair department. These works were far behind the needs of production development. The mine leadership sent a work team to investigate the manager's section and the mechanical and electrical repair workshop and found that the most fundamental problem was the unsound responsibility system. Due to unclear responsibilities, material personnel never went to the workshops and pitheads to understand the material needs. Even if people came to them, they would shirk responsibility and emphasize objective difficulties. When they were criticized by the leadership, they would not work with peace of mind. After the leadership learned about these situations, they strengthened political education and, according to the current work needs, sent material personnel to each pithead sub-warehouse to inventory materials, make a list, and send people to major cities to purchase missing materials, ensuring that they always maintain a one-month reserve.

Then, the materials were divided into twelve categories within the manager's section, and each category was assigned to a specific person. At the same time, the work was divided according to production units, and each person was responsible for a pithead or workshop. In addition to mastering the reserve and usage of the category of materials they were responsible for, they also had to master the consumption of various materials in a pithead or workshop and had the responsibility to report the situation of other materials to the person in charge of the item.

The mine also focused on selecting several major materials with a large consumption and which were also the main materials for production, and decided to find out their consumption and reserve quota. For example, regarding the consumption of rock drills, the mine has developed a card that is recorded every time it is repaired. It is expected that the usage cycle of rock drill parts can be found out after three months, and then a reasonable reserve can be set based on these statistics. In the future, it is also planned to use charts to control the reserve to achieve balanced procurement and supply.

Implemented a regular maintenance system: The mechanical and electrical repair workshop also implemented a "three guarantees" system of "guaranteeing operation, guaranteeing inspection, and guaranteeing maintenance," assigning responsibility for certain equipment and promoting a regular maintenance system. For example, the overhaul of the Xihai pit's winder road surface chain and transmission gear in late January was pre-arranged. In the past, pitheads were not accustomed to regular maintenance and thought that stopping production for maintenance was a "waste" of time. This time, the Xihai pit was no exception, emphasizing some difficulties and hesitating to carry out maintenance. However, due to the insistence of the maintenance cadres, it was finally overhauled on January 28. Before the overhaul, the mechanical and electrical repair workshop mobilized the maintenance workers. Feng Zhiguang, the leader of the repair team, was in high spirits and led the work team to conduct a general inspection of the winder. As a result, it was found that half of the active screw of the brake shoe had been broken. If it continued to be used, there was a risk of a runaway tank accident causing major casualties. The workers all thought this was a great harvest. The leadership seized this vivid example to conduct education, commended the Xihai pit for implementing regular maintenance, and also commended Feng Zhiguang, who was conscientious and responsible, laying the foundation for the implementation of the regular maintenance system.

Due to the establishment of the responsibility system, the chaotic situation in the manager's section and the mechanical and electrical repair workshop has changed, and a new atmosphere has emerged. For example, the responsible cadres of the manager's section know what work should be concentrated on now, what goals should be achieved, and what work should be prepared for in the next period. The direction of work is relatively clear. The enthusiasm of the technical personnel in the mechanical and electrical repair workshop has been improved. They actively think of ways to formulate maintenance cards, implement maintenance regulations and maintenance operation charts, and organize maintenance experience exchange meetings to summarize the lessons learned from past mechanical and electrical failures. Wang Lianqing, a material member who did not work very deeply in the past, has now been able to take the initiative to go to the concentrating plant to understand the situation. Seeing that the reserve of white ash is not much, he is anxious to find a way. The repair workers also actively went to the wind pump room of the Benshan pit to understand the operation of the machinery and expressed to the operation workers that they would contact more in their work in the future.

IV. Must continue to strengthen planning management and improve the balanced production work

Since the implementation of balanced production, the mine has reversed the phenomenon of slack at the beginning and tight at the end in production; the work of the management departments has begun to shift to the pithead and workshops to serve production. This achievement is very great. However, there are still some problems in planning management.

1. The plan lags behind reality. For example, the output of refined copper concentrate completed 149 percent of the plan in January; the wages of piecework workers in the concentrating plant generally exceeded the basic wage by more than 50 percent, and the highest reached 249 percent of the basic wage. In terms of exploration efficiency, what the mine director announced at the mass meeting was 1.17 meters, but the masses believed that 1.4 meters could be achieved.

2. For the entire mine, the plan is completed relatively evenly, but the equilibrium rate of pithead group operations is still relatively poor. Taking the horizontal exploration groups of the North Mountain pit in January as an example, the equilibrium rate of Zhang Shijie's group was 86 percent, the equilibrium rate of Ge Hongcai's group was 69 percent, and the equilibrium rate of Xu Fengji's group was 77 percent. The average equilibrium rate of the entire pit was 77 percent.

3. Mixed ore output is done relatively poorly. This is also a problem of comprehensive plan coordination. For example, the raw ore grade was planned to be 0.5 percent, but the actual sulfide ore was 0.661 percent, and the oxidized ore was 0.631 percent, with the highest reaching 0.88 percent. This practice of completing the plan with high grade is also incorrect. Secondly, the completion of major economic quotas is also unbalanced. For example, due to the increase in the grade of concentrate, the actual recovery rate was affected, so that the planned actual recovery rate of sulfide ore was 91 percent, but only 88 percent was achieved, which is still a wasteful practice.

In this mass mobilization to discuss the national plan and strengthen planning management, the mine should continue to deeply discuss the quotas on the basis of the average advanced quotas, conduct in-depth investigation and research, master the changing laws of working conditions, and formulate practical and feasible operation plans for the pithead and workshops to cooperate with each other without involving workers' wages; and continue to strengthen the dispatching work, discover weak links, and solve them; establish a special responsibility system in the process of solving problems, and consolidate the achievements.

    东北第二铜矿抓住主要环节组织均衡生产
    谢增瑞
    东北第二铜矿自一九五○年开始生产以来，每年都完成规定的生产任务，但是产品的质量不好。一九五○年和一九五一年成本都超支了。产生这些缺点的根本原因，是缺乏计划管理，不能实行均衡生产。从一九五二年二月、六月和八月的坑内作业来看，该矿均衡率最高是百分之九十四点六，最低是百分之四十。以全年完成采矿任务的情况来看，六月份最多，计完成计划百分之三百二十，九月份最少，仅完成计划百分之五十八，两者相差五倍多。由于生产不均衡，各个作业之间就不能密切配合。如采准主要是为了采矿，但采准完成计划的最高月份与最低月份相比，是二十四比一，这就直接影响了采矿作业的正常进行。其次是机械设备不能发挥效率。如架空索道运矿量，因北山坑出矿不均，时有停工待料或大量积压的现象。此外，因生产不均衡，月末常常突击，机械不能检修，常出故障（去年两次死亡事故都发生在中、下旬）。工人劳逸不均，损害健康，使坑口、车间在管理上增加很多不应有的麻烦。归根到底，生产不均衡给企业经营管理带来了“奇灾大祸”。
    上述生产不均衡的危害，引起了该矿领导干部的注意，下定决心要改变这种情况。该矿在有色金属管理局的指示和工作组的帮助下，去年第四季度开始在坑口、车间中实行了均衡生产。从今年一月以来，生产情况开始有了显著的变化。如今年一月份各项主要生产任务的均衡率均在百分之九十六以上，二月份也在百分之九十五以上。领导干部心中有了数，对完成国家计划有了信心；车间干部和科、室职员在均衡生产的组织下开始面向坑口、车间，改变了过去拖拉推诿的工作作风；有些管理制度如材料工具管理、设备检修等也开始加强了。现将该矿几个月来初步摸索到的几点经验介绍如下：
    一、制订坑口班组的切实可行的作业计划
    矿山生产的特点是坑口分散、采矿场不集中、矿脉分布不均、品位不一、岩石软硬不同、生产对象变化多，等等。因此掌握工作条件的变化规律，做好作业计划，是搞好均衡生产的基础。
    过去该矿领导干部怕完不成任务，布置计划时采取了层层加“保险数”的办法，即矿布置的任务比局订的计划高，各坑口、车间布置的任务又比矿订的高，小组的计划更比坑口计划高。这样层层增加的结果，小组计划往往比局订计划高百分之三十至五十。结果是小组计划完不成，而矿山计划照样完成。这样的计划就不能起指导生产的作用，而且减低了工人对完成计划的信心。
    该矿刚实行均衡生产时，虽改变了层层加“保险数”的订计划的办法，但为了能均衡地完成任务，就根据过去前松后紧的突击生产情况，订了一个“前松后紧”的计划。例如在一九五二年十一月，硫化矿处理量计划上旬为全月的百分之二十六点一六，中、下旬各为全月的百分之三十六点九二。以后该矿领导方面强调要扭转这个偏向，就抓紧了月初的计划。以去年十二月份本山坑出矿为例，上旬二千八百二十吨，中旬二千一百吨，下旬一千六百二十吨。这样，计划又一变而为“前紧后松”。这同样不能实行均衡生产。
    为了改正上述的缺点，该矿从今年一月份开始，作业计划由生产科和计划科根据坑口地质条件、岩石软硬程度和设备能力等具体情况，经过各坑口主任的讨论，统一编定计划，交给群众讨论。坑口干部、工人有实际作业经验，对岩质变化、矿石品位高低的规律是比较心中有数的。计划经群众讨论修正，再由生产、计划两科研究、综合，更加切合实际。最后宣布经过讨论后的全矿计划，要求各小组订出计划保证完成。
    各小组在讨论计划时，也根据自己小组的作业掌子的岩石软硬程度、凿岩机的效能、搬运情况、工人技术水平等条件，讨论完成任务的方法和应该克服那些缺点，然后通过自报公议的方式，加以最后决定。每日、每班、每个掌子的实际进度确定之后，再由下而上地编制小组、工段、坑口的作业计划，制成小组、坑口和矿的指示图表。这样由小组确定下来的生产计划，就成为每个工人的奋斗目标，他们主动地研究完成任务的办法，解决执行任务当中的困难，真正做到心中有数。例如北山坑有一次统计员忘记了填写图表，工人就去追问，这说明了工人们十分关心自己的工作进度，也说明了计划已初步为群众所掌握。
    二、成立调度机构，检查计划执行情况
    为了检查各坑口每日、每班作业计划的执行情况，保证实行均衡生产，该矿成立了由矿长直接领导的调度室，并根据矿山分散、不易作全面的及时的检查这一特点，建立了用电话汇报的制度。在检查中，对没有完成计划的就追问原因，并想出解决的办法。如须由坑口自己解决的，就要求订出解决的计划和时间；如须由科、室解决的，调度室也及时检查解决的情况。
    在调度室检查计划执行情况中，如发现某些单位的工作经常妨碍着生产的正常进行，或某一种作业经常完不成任务，便派干部深入现场调查研究，待掌握情况之后，再根据问题的大小，组织机动力量，深入现场进行帮助，直到解决问题为止。这就对均衡生产起了保证作用。
    该矿计划管理水平还很低，制度多，因此，无人负责或职责不明确的现象和工作拖拉推诿的作风还很严重。调度机构的建立，对于克服上述混乱现象起了很大作用。例如去年十二月以前，本山坑的原矿供应不上选矿场的需要，须从西海坑供应部分矿石；但听说无端卷扬机坏了，无人负责检查坏的程度如何，能否很快修理好，就不顾成本雇用大车运输，在四个月内共运了两万多吨，使每月产品成本增加了四、五千万元。直至调度室成立后，发现了这个问题，派干部去调查，才查明不能运送矿石的原因是吊道翻车，路不好，有些地方太陡了。这一段路两天半就修好了。
    该矿从生产上总的要求出发，去发现那些部门是当前最薄弱的环节，及时组织力量加以解决。例如去年十二月份汽车出车率低，十台运精矿的车子经常有四、五台甚至七、八台停驶修理。实行均衡生产和建立调度室以后，就发现了这一薄弱环节。于是领导方面派专人分头向司机进行了解，发现有些司机在闹工资问题，加上缺乏制度和教育，工人普遍不干活，藉故不出车；另外派人到修理部门去了解，发现内部无组织、无制度，个别工人想中途搭车，被司机拒绝，因而怀恨在心，故意不给汽车修配零件。更重要的是机电修理车间主任存在着错误的想法，把领导方面号召的“辅助部门要面向坑口”的意思领会成单纯“面向坑内”，因此不给汽车零件加工。矿的领导方面根据这种情况，分别加以处理。除令机电修理车间主任向运输队作检讨外，并订立了加工制度，交任务时规定取件的时间，到时不交，由调度室催要。
    该矿过去基本建设上有错误，也造成设备上的不平衡。如选矿常发生水量不足的问题，严重地影响了选矿工作。原因是蓄水池太小了，各坑不能经常也不能同时向蓄水池抽水。为了按计划进行生产，该矿便规定蓄水池须经常保持两公尺深的水量，调度室每隔两小时用电话查问一次，就保证了选矿用水的需要量。
    调度室的确起了很大的作用，它使干部们的工作比较深入了。在坑口，至少每班有一个坑主任深入坑下检查工作，发现问题及时解决。如头一班未完成任务，第二班就着了急，第三班非得设法完成任务不可。
    生产科长与计划科长在调度室值班、听汇报，他们对于现场的生产情况能及时掌握，如果有大的问题发生，他们就不能不亲自下坑去解决。
    过去干部强调矿山的特殊性，认为岩石的软硬和矿量的变化是无法预知的，因而完成任务的信心不大。但实行均衡生产以后，摸到了经验，认识到掌握自然条件的变化是完全可能的。基于这种认识，计划工作者和干部进一步认识到作好矿山的作业计划也是完全可能的。
    三、从制订和执行作业计划中建立了一些制度
    建立了材料工具供应的分工专责制：该矿实行均衡生产以后，突出地暴露了技术供应部门和机电检修部门工作中的严重无人负责现象，这些工作远远落后于生产发展的需要。该矿领导方面派工作组深入经理科和机电修理车间调查，发现最根本的问题是责任制不健全。由于职责不明，材料人员从不去车间、坑口了解材料的需要情况，纵使人家找上门来，也要推脱责任，强调客观困难。他们受到领导方面的批评时，就不安心工作。领导方面了解到这些情况之后，便加强了政治教育，并根据当前工作需要，派材料人员到各坑口分库清点材料，造出清单，派人到大城市去购制缺少的材料，做到了经常保持一个月的储备量。
    接着，在经理科内把材料分成十二大类，每一类都指定专人负责，同时又按生产单位分工，每个人负责一个坑口或车间，除了掌握自己负责的那一类材料的储备量和使用情况之外，还要掌握一个坑口或车间的各种材料消耗情况，并有责任把有关其他材料的情况向主管该项材料的负责人汇报。
    该矿还有重点地选出几种消耗量较大而又是生产上的主要材料，决定找出其消耗量和储备定额。如关于凿岩机的消耗，该矿已制订了一种卡片，在每次修理时都记录下来，预计三个月后就可以找出凿岩机零件的使用周期，再根据这些统计订出合理的储备量。今后还打算用图表来控制储备量，做到均衡地采购和供应。
    执行了定期检修制度：在机电修理车间也实行了“包运转、包检查、包检修”的三包制，分工负责一定的设备，并推行了定期检修制。如西海坑一月下旬检修卷扬机路表链子和传动牙轮，就是预先排定的。过去坑口不习惯定期检修，认为停产检修有些“浪费”时间。这次西海坑也不例外，强调一些困难，迟迟不肯检修，但由于检修干部的坚持，终于在一月二十八日检修了。在检修之前，机电修理车间对检修工做了动员工作。修理组长冯志广情绪很高，带领工作组对卷扬机进行了普遍的检查。结果发现抱闸皮的活动螺丝已断了一半，如再使用下去，有发生跑罐事故招致重大伤亡的危险。工人们都认为这是一个大收获。领导方面就抓住了这一活的事例进行教育，表扬了执行定期检修的西海坑，同时也表扬了认真负责的冯志广，给贯彻定期检修制打下了基础。
    由于责任制的建立，经理科和机电修理车间的混乱局面改变了，出现了新气象。如经理科的负责干部知道目前应该集中力量做些什么工作，要求达到什么目的，下一个时期准备进行什么工作，工作方向比较明确了。机电修理车间技术人员的工作热情提高了，主动想办法制定检修卡片，贯彻了检修规程与检修作业图表，并组织检修经验交流会，总结过去机电故障的教训。材料员王连清过去工作很不深入，现已能主动到选矿场去了解情况，看到白灰储量不多，自己就急忙想办法。检修工人也主动到本山坑的风泵房去了解机械运转情况，并向运转工人表示：今后要在工作中多多联系。
    四、必须继续加强计划管理，把均衡生产工作提高一步
    该矿执行均衡生产以来，已在生产上扭转了前松后紧的现象；管理部门的工作，已开始转向坑口、车间，为生产服务。这个成绩是很大的。但在计划管理方面还存在着一些问题。
    1、计划落后于实际。例如精矿纯铜产量，一月份完成计划百分之一百四十九；选矿场计件工人一般工资超过基本工资百分之五十以上，最高达到基本工资的百分之二百四十九。表现在探矿效率上，矿长在群众大会上所宣布的是一点一七公尺，但群众认为一点四公尺是能够达到的。
    2、就整个矿来说，计划是比较均衡地完成了，但坑口小组作业均衡率还比较差。以一月份北山坑水平探矿各组为例，张士杰小组的均衡率为百分之八十六，葛洪财小组的均衡率为百分之六十九，徐风基小组的均衡率为百分之七十七，全坑平均均衡率为百分之七十七。
    3、混合出矿做得比较差。这也是一个计划的全面配合问题。例如原矿品位，计划订为百分之零点五，但实际硫化矿为百分之零点六六一，氧化矿为百分之零点六三一，最高达到百分之零点八八。这种用高品位来完成计划的做法也是不对的。其次，主要经济定额的完成也不平衡。如由于精矿品位的提高，影响了实收率下降，使硫化矿计划实收率百分之九十一只达到百分之八十八，这还是一种浪费的做法。
    该矿在这次发动群众讨论国家计划和加强计划管理工作中，应在不牵涉工人工资的前提下，继续深入讨论定额，在平均先进定额的基础上深入调查研究，掌握工作条件的变化规律，制订出坑口、车间切实可行的相互配合的作业计划；并继续加强调度工作，发现薄弱环节，加以解决；在解决问题的过程中建立专责制，把取得的成绩巩固下来。
