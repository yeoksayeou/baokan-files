    Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, 2nd. Tibetan farmers in Xigazê and other areas of the Yarlung Zangbo River basin, having received interest-free agricultural loans and grain loans from the Chinese People's Liberation Army, have victoriously completed their spring ploughing and sowing work.
    Before the spring ploughing, the People's Liberation Army stationed in Xigazê sent more than ten agricultural loan teams deep into the rural areas, lending a total of more than 400,000 jin of highland barley grain to thousands of Tibetan farmers who lacked seeds and farm implements. In many areas, farmers planted seeds on land that had been barren for many years after receiving the seeds. Farmers in Jandang Village, Lazizi Zong, planted all 100 mu of land that had been idle for ten years. Now, spring ploughing and sowing east of Xigazê have been completed, and in some places the highland barley seedlings are already more than an inch tall. The farmers are happy to see the robust seedlings and say: This year will surely be another bumper harvest! When the agricultural loan team members left the rural areas, groups of Tibetan men and women came out to see them off. They poured the best highland barley wine to bid farewell to the agricultural loan team and wished Chairman Mao good health.

    日喀则等地春耕播种结束
    【新华社拉萨二日电】西藏雅鲁藏布江流域日喀则等地的藏族农民，得到中国人民解放军发放的无利农业贷款和贷粮以后，已经胜利地完成春耕播种工作。
    春耕以前，驻日喀则人民解放军便派出了十多个农贷小组，深入到各农村，把共合四十多万斤青稞的粮款贷给几千户缺乏种籽和农具的藏族农民。很多地区的农民得到种籽以后，都在荒芜了多年的土地上下了种。拉孜宗的加当村农民把闲了十年的一百亩地全都播了种。现在，日喀则以东各地春耕播种已经结束，有的地方青稞苗已一寸多高。农民们看见茁壮的禾苗都高兴地说：今年一定又是一个丰收年！当农贷组人员离开农村时，成群的男女藏民出来欢送，他们斟满最好的青稞酒，为农贷组饯行，并祝福毛主席身体健康。
