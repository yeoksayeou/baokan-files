    In the White Mountains and Black Waters
    By our reporter Chen Yongjin
    (Continued from yesterday)
      May on the Songhua River
    In May, the tranquil Songhua River becomes lively. The lumberjacks in the Songhua River basin are shifting from one level of production to another.
    The workers of the Jiamusi Forestry Bureau announced their determination: not only to complete the task of floating 500,000 cubic meters of timber twenty days ahead of schedule, but also to exceed it by 30,000 cubic meters.
    At dawn, in the misty morning, the timber rafts on the Songhua River began to float down from Xiaogudong. Ji Huidong, the tall and gentle veteran rafting worker leading the way, brought several rafts down. The superiors had instructed them to float the timber to Jiamusi and return within eight days. Ji Huidong constantly kept in mind the instructions of the Party Branch Secretary and the Director: to transport the timber down early to support the country's great construction. But he said: We must not lose a single piece of timber and strive to return in four days.
    Ji Huidong guided the timber raft forward. They felt the Songhua River's current was slow, and they constantly used small poles to propel it. The task of floating over 1,000 cubic meters of timber was quite heavy. However, he was not afraid of "Full of Stars" (the name given by the rafting workers to the most difficult waterway in the Songhua River) with its many rocks and dangers. He had become familiar with the Songhua River's channels in the past two or three years; as long as there was no wind, he could navigate it even in the dead of night.
    The workers floating rafts on the Songhua River are most concerned about the wind. The Songhua River's current is calm. When there is no wind, the surface of the water is as smooth as a mirror, without even a ripple. When there is wind, although the waves are not very large, the timber rafts cannot withstand them. If a strong wind scatters the timber raft, they will not be able to complete the task for ten days in a row and will be soaking in the water all day long; if it is blown to an uninhabited area, they will also go hungry. Ji Huidong stood at the front of the small pole raft, poling and looking around at the weather. A little wind could not stop the timber raft from moving forward, and without wind, they continued to float even at night. Their wish was to arrive a day early, even an hour early. This was completely different from before liberation. At that time, one could set up a small pot on the big raft and cook fish, and who cared when the timber raft reached its destination? Now, once they were on the raft, who ate a full meal! Ten of them only ate ten catties of rice a day, while normally each person would eat a catty per meal. Ji Huidong held up three fingers and said, "We completed this task in just over three days; not only did we not lose a single piece of timber, but we also picked up seventeen pieces!" These people arrived in Jiamusi after two days and two nights without rest. They did not stop in Jiamusi and returned from the land route. On everyone's feet, blisters were as big as coins, but no one complained. Even the elderly who had gone gray in the rafting life, like the young workers, carried their large luggage back tirelessly.
    The hundreds of rafting workers here were transferred from the Yalu River in the Liaodong forest area two years ago. Most of them had been rafting on the Yalu River and the Heilong River, and they had grown up and aged in the winds and waves of the Yalu River and the Heilong River. They said: The leadership is so good now! As soon as there is an accident, boats come to help. In the dark old days, the timber could float wherever it wanted, and who cared about people's lives! The eldest son of an old rafting worker was washed away by timber in the Yalu River; the second son was washed away in the Heilong River, and even his body was not found. Whenever it was time for rafting, they burned incense and kowtowed, praying to the gods for protection, but what was the use? Since they came to the Songhua River, no one has been injured.
    After the rafting workers from the Yalu River came to the Songhua River, they replaced the large pole rafts with small pole rafts, which completely changed the face of the work here. The old large pole rafts were clumsy and wasted timber. The large pole rafts had two holes drilled on each side of each piece of timber, wasting one and a half to two feet of each piece. They were also clumsy to float, and no one could do anything if they were damaged or ran aground. The small pole rafts use吊游 (diàoyóu, a type of hook and chain) to connect the timber, so the timber does not need to be drilled, and it will not be damaged;吊游 can be used many times. Now, a raft can be compiled with up to six or seven hundred cubic meters of timber, and it only takes two people to compile it; a large pole raft can only be compiled with one or two hundred cubic meters, and it takes four or five people to compile it. Now, as long as the workers compile the rafts, they can be released immediately.
    The rafting workers are afraid of both low water and high water. The workers here all remember the floods on the Songhua River last year. At that time, there was a large dam (timber blocked and accumulated into a pile) checked on the large iron bridge, and the entire river surface was covered with large timber rafts for more than ten miles. Later, over 50,000 cubic meters ran away at once, some being washed down five or six hundred miles away, and it was only recently that they were retrieved. The workers were determined to finish their work before the flood season ended. It was raining heavily that day, and the work team leader wanted to ask the workers to take a break. He rang the bell for so long, but he couldn't call back the compilation workers working in the rain. Compilation looks easy, just compiling the timber that flows down one by one; but it is really uncomfortable to do. How many axes don't you have to hit on each piece of timber? Many of their hands were cracked, and some people's hands were swollen like steamed buns. The compilation workers in the slow current knew their responsibilities well. If they didn't compile quickly, it would affect the flow in the small river; it would also affect the rafting in the big river; if the rafts were not compiled well, they would easily break in the river. But no matter how nervous they were, they obviously did not satisfy the demands of the rafting workers.
    In that slow-flowing compilation yard of the Songhua River, timber was flowed down one by one from the upper reaches of the Xiaogudong River. It is much more dangerous to float in a small river than to fell trees in the mountains or float rafts in a big river. The people responsible for the floating began working as early as late March and early April. They first opened the frozen river to let the timber flow down early. At that time, the weather was cold, it was snowing, and their legs were soaking in the water. In late May, I saw an amazingly tense scene at the mouth of the Xiaogudong River—the timber was dammed up. Without fast hands, quick eyes, and nimble feet of young lads here, it is difficult to complete the task. It was already dark that day, and the meal whistle blew again and again, but the lads dismantling the dam seemed not to hear it. They walked back and forth like flying on the timber in the rapids. They listened to the loud horn of a burly leader on the timber and sang their habitual chants. Under the command of that leader, in no time, after only a few pieces of timber were dismantled, large quantities of timber flowed down. This worker's name was He Licheng. He said: This is the easiest dam to dismantle. Sometimes a check finds more than 10,000 cubic meters, and it takes several days to dismantle it if you can't find the "eye of the dam." These people never stop, regardless of snow, rain, or wind. They say: It's even more energetic when it rains.
      Changbai Mountain Takes the Lead
    Last August, the Soviet forestry expert Idanov came to the Changbai Mountain forest area. When the workers were working, he watched how they used new tools; when the workers were resting, he chatted with them and participated in their entertainment evenings. Before he left Changbai Mountain, he drew conclusions about the work here. He said: These new tools are all successful, and this is a manifestation of the high wisdom of the Chinese working class. He was particularly interested in the wooden rails. He said: "In China, where steel is still lacking, this kind of creation is very valuable. I suggest using the names of the inventors as the names of these new tools." A few days later, the Northeast Forestry Department issued a decision ordering the naming of the double-axle sliding bar as the "Tian Fengchang-style Timber Transporter," the wooden tank as the "Zhou Yunzhang Timber Truck," the wooden flatcar as the "Zhang Shuxi Timber Truck," the steel rail double-axle sliding bar as the "Li Baosen Timber Transporter," the automatic sleigh as the "Meng Zhaowu Timber Transporter," and the single-axle sliding bar as the "Zhang Zengli Timber Transporter." The basic principle of these new tools is to lay iron or wooden rails on the hillside and put the timber on them to slide down from the mountain. This tool looks simple, but it has become the key to improving my country's current forestry production—moving from seasonal operations to year-round operations, and making temporary workers permanent.
    When the Northeast launched the campaign to increase production and practice economy, the responsible comrade of the Liaodong Forestry Bureau asked Cong Lianzi, the director of the Linjiang Branch Bureau: "How is your task of increasing grain production by 100,000 tons progressing?" This figure made the young Branch Bureau director (a former floating worker) consider a lot: with such seasonal operations, such a large task is difficult to complete. He asked the Bureau director: "Are there enough steel rails?" The Bureau director said: "Where are there so many steel rails! Try to find a knack." Cong Lianzi and the General Branch Secretary Li Wenchang studied many times, and they believed that there was not much problem with logging, but transportation was very difficult. However, they also understood that as long as they relied on the workers to tap potential, difficulties could be overcome. In this way, most of the cadres of the Branch Bureau went down, and Cong Lianzi and Li Wenchang also went to the workshop to mobilize the workers to solve this difficult problem.
    When they came to the workers' shed, they first mobilized the workers to raise questions. At that time, the workers raised problems such as the inability to send money and letters and the inability to eat vegetables, and they seriously solved them all. Then Cong Lianzi and Li Wenchang mobilized the workers to engage in production and conservation, and to produce more timber, so that everyone's future life would be better. Large and small meetings, large and small groups discussed how to find a knack. Some said: We must transport as we harvest. Some proposed: Don't carry the wood, we can pull it down from the mountain. At this time, someone created a wooden roller, putting the wood on the wooden roller and rolling it down; some people spread tree branches on the ground and slid down on the branches. Cong Lianzi saw the signs here: It is possible to transport timber without cattle and horses. They held an award meeting. At the meeting, he mobilized everyone to work less and work more, and to eliminate cattle and horse-like labor. At this time, as long as Cong Lianzi and Li Wenchang heard that a worker had a very small creation, they would personally go there to inquire about it and encourage them. Cong Lianzi systematically supported Tian Fengchang (a labor model who attended the Seventh National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions), allocating steel rails to him for experimentation, not only supporting him technically, but also educating him politically. As a result, he completely created the double-axle sliding bar. There were more and more creations in the Linjiang Branch Bureau, and Cong Lianzi and Li Wenchang established a knack committee. After that, Zhou Yunzhang's "Wooden Tank" came out, Meng Zhaowu's "Automatic Sleigh" came out, and dozens of new tools appeared, and inventions reached the first climax. As a result, the Northeast forestry work was transformed from seasonal operations to what workers called "manual automation."
    When the creations and inventions of the Linjiang Branch Bureau reached a climax, an old man with a tall figure was lying in the hospital. This person was Liu Runqi, an old worker who had worked in the forest area for thirty years. He couldn't stay in the hospital because of these creations and inventions. He asked the president of the hospital to be discharged. He recalled that thirty years ago, life, like a whip, drove him from his hometown in Shandong to the Northeast to become a forestry worker. The police thugs at that time disliked his hard to understand speech and bad appearance, and often beat and scolded him. The whip of life, the enemy's whip, drove him across the Yalu River to the east bank of Korea. He lived in Korea for eighteen years. When China was liberated, he returned to his motherland. He thought on the hospital bed: Who treats himself like the Party? When I got sick, the superiors told me to stay in the hospital, and the nurses in the hospital were kinder than his own daughters; he had never had a wife in his life, and now he has so many good daughters. The more he thought about this, the more he felt the importance of going out to work. He thought: How many cattle and horses are needed for winter transportation? An animal eats eight catties of material a day, and eats ten to fifteen catties of grass. Eight people carry a small piece of wood, and some are so tired that they vomit blood. How much good timber is cut short because it cannot be carried; how much timber rots on the mountain because it cannot be transported down; how many people are injured because they carry timber. He also thought: Many comrades have inventions, and I want to make these creations even better. He remembered seeing a tool when he worked in Korea eighteen years ago, using two pieces of wood to slide down, which was very easy; but he couldn't remember how it was made. He thought: Laying sleepers on two wooden rails, putting a single rail on top, and then using a wooden horse to put it down, it must be very good; it would be even more stable with a brake. Thinking of this, he resolutely asked the president to be discharged from the hospital. He was still sick after he went back, and people wanted to send him to the hospital again. Liu Runqi said: "If I don't do my job well, I won't go back even if I die in the forest; it's always better at 'home' than in the hospital. If I can't work, I can assign work to everyone." When his illness improved a little, he secretly made a model when everyone was working. At this time, Cong Lianzi knew that Liu Runqi was going to create, so he enlightened him. But Liu Runqi was afraid of losing face if he failed, and always said "no creation." Director Cong said: If you need anything, we will support you. He finally expressed that he would definitely work hard to complete the task. He modified the model again and again, told the workers again and again, tried it again and again, everyone said it was good, and asked him to make a bigger one. He started working again. The "hooves" (the bottom surface of the horizontal wood under the wooden horse) of the wooden horse must be soaked in soybean oil and then baked with fire to be hard and slippery, so he took his own money to buy oil; he wanted to use rubber for the brake, so he ran to Linjiang, a hundred miles away, to buy rubber. Later, they started testing the single-rail wooden horse, and many people ran to see it. Old Liu was so nervous! More than 400 meters away from the mountain to the bottom of the mountain, he first loaded one cubic meter, and he steadily put it down with a rope pulling the brake. All the audience applauded warmly. Everyone asked him to come a second time. The second time he loaded two cubic meters, and it went down steadily again. The most he loaded was four cubic meters (it would take a set of strong livestock to pull only two cubic meters). In this way, the work efficiency of their team increased from 0.8 cubic meters per day in the past to 1.3 cubic meters. In two months, their team felled and transported 1,000 cubic meters, using only a broken rubber tire and 150 catties of wire nails. The timber they felled could be transported out in a few days or even a day. This new tool is more suitable for the current situation in my country's forest areas than the previous six creations. It can be used regardless of winter or summer, or spring and autumn, or snow and rain, and it can be applied on slopes with a gradient of 8% to 30%, and the cost is also the lowest. Their team completed the task easily and happily in the rhythmic sound of the single-rail wooden horse transporting timber.
    Several other teams also learned to use Liu Runqi's single-rail wooden horse and successfully completed their tasks. The Liaodong Forest Industry Bureau's creations reached another climax from one climax. The Northeast Forest Industry Bureau made a decision to promote Liu Runqi's single-rail wooden horse on a large scale throughout the Northeast. The Linjiang Branch Bureau implemented historically significant year-round operations in their creations and inventions, and overfulfilled the task of increasing grain production by 100,000 tons.
    The new tools in Liaodong have been widely accepted by the workers in the forest areas of Changbai Mountain and Xiaoxing'anling and other places. The people who came here to visit and study were very interested in the new tools in Liaodong. A section chief from the Heilongjiang Forestry Bureau said: Visiting for these few days is better than going to a forestry school for several years. I completely broke the idea that it is impossible to transport timber up the mountain without cattle and horses. I can reduce the number of horse sets for transporting 400,000 cubic meters of timber when I go back. An engineer from the Jiamusi Forestry Bureau said: I have been working in forestry for forty years, and this is the first time I have seen such good tools. The new tools in Liaodong not only enable the Northeast to use 100,000 fewer livestock to transport timber in the severe cold, but also enable timber to be transported to the construction sites of the motherland earlier. In year-round operations, the workers' welfare problems here have also been solved satisfactorily.
       Happy Changbai Mountain
    In early May, I walked along the Yalu River into the depths of the Changbai Mountain forest area. The wheat in southern China has already been harvested, but it is still spring here. There is still snow on the back of the high mountains, and yellow cattle are plowing the fields at the foot of Changbai Mountain. Further in is Manjiang Village.
    Manjiang is commonly called "Workers' New Village," but it actually has a history of decades. Before liberation, there were only a few Korean families living here who made a living by hunting, and their lives were very hard. After liberation, at the beginning of the country's economic construction, the small village of Manjiang suddenly added hundreds of workers' families; those rows of long new tile houses and roads made Manjiang even more beautiful.
    There is no sandstorm in the spring inside the mountains and forests. The workers are resting these days, returning home from the mountains. Some are planting vegetables, and some are walking in the clean courtyards with their babies in their arms. The children's mothers and some new brides are either doing housework in the house or washing colorful clothes by the river. We walked into the home of Yu Zhijie, the director of the Women's Federation. Her husband was watching the child in the cradle. She had just bought pork to make meat cakes for her husband; because he was going back to the mountains tonight to log. Yu Zhijie lifted the colorful door curtain and let us in. Several colorful quilts were placed on the clean kang, colorful paintings were pasted on the white walls, and under another white cloth curtain were bags and bags of food. She said: Life is better, I don't want bad things anymore. There are no good thermos bottles in the cooperative, so I'll boil water for you to drink if you're thirsty. Yu Zhijie's husband said: If it wasn't for liberation, wouldn't I be running around all my life (In the Northeast, "bachelor" is called "running around")! Now I have such a primary school teacher as my lover. Yu Zhijie led us to the home of Wu Yuchun next door, and her house was exactly the same as Yu Zhijie's. In fact, the houses of the workers' families in Manjiang are all the same: a small kitchen, a large bedroom; new cloth curtains are drawn on the glass windows, and as soon as you open the windows, plenty of sunlight shines in. I saw many workers' families here and concluded that Wu Yuchun's family is a very ordinary worker family. The furnishings in Wu Yuchun's house are also similar to those in other houses. There is a portrait of Stalin, a portrait of Chairman Mao, a patriotic covenant, and New Year pictures such as "Xiao Erhei's Wedding Full Picture" and "The Cowherd and the Weaver Girl"; under a white cloth curtain are several new colorful quilts. On a short table are "Quick Literacy Method", "Thirty Years of the Communist Party of China", "Political Textbook" and diary, and an electrician is installing electric lights. A rosy-cheeked young man came in. The director of the Women's Federation introduced: "This is Wu Yuchun's lover, Zhao Yongxiang. Look how well they are matched!" Wu Yuchun said with a smile: "You are also good!" Both young people were bitter people in the past. Wu Yuchun lost her parents early and lived with her grandmother. Zhao Yongxiang's mother died when he was seven, and his father died when he was thirteen. He followed his two elder brothers to farm for others; his elder brothers went to the fields to work, and he cooked at home. If he didn't cook well, he thought of his mother while burning the pot, and tears fell into the rice bowl and on the firewood. After liberation, his two elder brothers joined the army, and he came to the forest area in 1950. In the summer of 1951, when he was on vacation, he went to his cousin's house. The cousin's wife, whom he met for the first time, said to him: "Third (that is, Zhao Yongxiang), my sister said, how about it for you?" Zhao Yongxiang said:
    "I'm running around, I have nothing at home, who wants me!" His cousin's wife said: "You won't be running around when you have a wife! I think you two are very suitable." Last February, Zhao Yongxiang went to his cousin's house again when he was on vacation. The day after he went, his cousin's wife called Wu Yuchun. When Zhao Yongxiang saw such a good girl, he was afraid that she wouldn't want him. When Wu Yuchun saw such a good young man as Zhao Yongxiang, she was also afraid that he wouldn't want her. Zhao Yongxiang asked Wu Yuchun first: "Do you have any objections?" Wu Yuchun continued: "I don't." Later, Wu Yuchun said again: "Don't disagree with people in the workshop! Don't fall behind!" Zhao Yongxiang said: "Why haven't you joined the Youth League?" Wu Yuchun said: "I'm not qualified." They ate together for a few days, became familiar, took engagement photos, and got married not long after. Zhao Yongxiang flipped back and forth through the "Quick Literacy Method" and said: "Now I can recognize more than 2,000 characters, and I can read newspapers and books. Who would have thought I would have this now?" He continued: "Who would marry a lumberjack in the past! Now it's different. There are twenty married people in our workshop alone; there are so many people looking for partners now!" Wu Yuchun continued: "Look at these hundreds of workers' families, aren't they all found in these years!"
    In the logging workshop, all the equipment is also satisfactory. Zhao Yongxiang described the situation in their workshop: "Now every workshop has a bathhouse, and no one can go without taking a bath for three days. There are also people who specialize in washing clothes. Now it has been decided to give everyone a thermos and a washbasin. In the morning, we eat soy milk fritters, and at noon we eat rice and white flour, and we have a feast every week. The leadership takes care of us Muslims and buys us beef, mutton and fish. Now we study for an hour every day, and we will implement Sundays this year. Look, it's only lively when we rest? Acting, playing the piano, almost all the young people have harmonicas. Every worker has money in the bank." A comrade in the Manjiang bank once told me that in January, there were only 14,000 savings accounts for prize savings, and it is not uncommon to save millions at once.
    In the Liaodong forest area, it is not just a workshop or just Manjiang that is like this. Four of us ate a meal in the Birch Tree Worker's Canteen, four dishes and one soup, including fried meat slices, shredded fried pork, scrambled eggs, fried kidneys, rice and steamed buns, and it only cost 13,000 yuan. Changbai Mountain is already a natural big garden, and the director here also wants to build a garden in Birch Tree. He said: The seeds have already been bought. A swimming pool will also be built in the garden for swimming in the summer and skating in the winter. They bought dairy cows, bought dairy goats, and brought famous Peking ducks; they want to raise a large group of Peking duck breeds, so that they can make pressed ducks in the future. In many places, especially in forest areas, it is often impossible to eat pork. Here, you can eat fresh pork, mutton, and beef every day. They grow their own vegetables, and harvested 250,000 catties of vegetables last year. The leadership pays great attention to solving the workers' living problems, and the cooks who cook have been trained in training classes. The happy and happy life here is the result of the leaders and workers working together to find solutions. (End)

      五月松花江
    五月里，平静的松花江上热闹起来了。松花江流域的伐木工人们，从一个生产高度转换到另一个生产高度来。
    佳木斯森林工业管理局的职工宣布了他们的决心：不但要提前二十天完成流送五十万立方公尺木材的任务，而且还要超过三万立方公尺。
    天刚亮，朝雾茫茫里，松花江水面的木排开始从小古洞流下来了。为首的那个高个子、性格温和的老流送工人纪会东，领着几张木排下来了。上级给他们规定八天里面把这些木材流送到佳木斯再返回来。纪会东时时刻刻地记着党支部书记和所长的指示：要提前把木材运下去，支援国家的大建设。但他说：我们要不损失一棵木材，并争取在四天里回来。
    纪会东引导着木排前进。他们嫌松花江的流水慢，还不时地用小棹摇着。这一千多立方公尺木头的流送任务，是够沉重的。但是，他不怕那石头最多最危险的“满天星”（流送工人为松花江里最难走的水道起的名字），他这二三年里已经熟知松花江的河道；只要没有风，黑天半夜都一样走。
    在松花江里放排流送的工人们最耽心的是风。松花江的流水是平静的，没风的时候水面平得像镜子一样，连点波纹都没有。有风时波浪虽然不怎样大，但是木排是经不起风浪的。如果大风把木排刮散了，他们就会一连十几天不能完成任务，整天价在水里泡着；如果刮到没人居住的地方，他们还会挨饿。纪会东站在小棹排的前面，一面摇着小棹，一面张望着四周的天气。有点小风不能使木排停止前进，没有风在夜里也照常流下去。他们的愿望是早到一天是一天，早到一时是一时。这和解放以前是完全不同了。那时节，在大排上把小锅一支，把鱼一煮，谁管木排那一天到目的地呢？现在，一上了排，谁吃下去饭了呀！他们十个人一天才吃了十斤米。而平常每人一顿也要一斤。纪会东伸出三个指头说：“我们这趟任务，三天多就完成了；不但没有损失一根木头，还拾到十七根木头哩！”这些人两天两夜没有休息到达了佳木斯，在佳木斯没有停，从旱道上又返回来了。每个人的脚上，泡打得像钱一样大。但也没人叫苦。连那些在流送生活里白了头发的老年人，也像青年工人一样不知疲倦地扛着大行李走回来。
    这里的几百个放排工人，都是二年前从辽东林区的鸭绿江上转来的。他们大多数都是在鸭绿江和黑龙江放排的，也都是在鸭绿江和黑龙江的风浪里成长又年老的。他们说：这时候领导上多好呀！一出事故，船就去帮助。在过去那黑暗的年代里，木头愿流到那里就流到那里，人死活谁管！一个老放排工人的大儿子在鸭绿江里被木头冲死了；二儿子在黑龙江里冲死了，人死了连尸首都没找到。一到放排时，就烧香磕头，求神保佑，可是有什么用？他们到松花江后，就没伤过一个人。
    鸭绿江的放排工人来到松花江后，用小棹排代替了大棹排，使这里的工作彻底地改变了面貌。过去的大棹排，又笨又浪费木材。大棹排在每根木材的两边凿成两个眼子，每根木材要浪费一尺半到二尺；流送起来又笨，碰坏了或搁浅了谁都没办法。这小棹排用吊游把木头联起来，木头不用凿眼，不会伤损；吊游用多少次都可以。现在，一张排最多可编到六七百立方公尺木材，也是用两个人编；大棹排只能编到一二百立方公尺，就要四、五个人编。现在只要编排的工人编出来，他们就可以马上放走。
    流送的工人怕水小也怕水大。这里的工人们都记得去年松花江发大水的情形。那时在大铁桥上查了大垛（木材受阻积成了一堆），整个江面上十多里都是大木排。后来一下跑了五万多立方公尺，有的被冲下去五六百里远，直到现在才弄回来。职工们决心在洪水期结束他们的工作。那天下着大雨，工队长想叫工人们休息一下。他敲钟敲了那样长时间，也没有敲回在雨里工作的编排工人。编排看起来好像很容易，把流下来的木头一根根编起来就行了；做起来可实在不好受。那一个木头不要打几斧子？他们很多人的手被震裂了，有的人手肿得像馍馍一样。在缓流里的编排工人很知道自己的责任，编不快就会影响小河里的流送；也会影响大河里的放排；排编不好，到江里又容易坏。但不管他们如何紧张，显然也没有满足放排工人的要求。
    在那松花江缓流的编排场里，从小古洞河的上游把木材一根一根地流下来。在小河里进行流送，要比在山场上采伐或在大河里放排凶险得多。担负流送的人们，早在三月底四月初就开始工作了。他们先把冰河打开使木头早流下来。那时候天气冷，上面下着雪，脚腿泡在水里面。五月的下旬，我在小古洞河口看见了惊人紧张的场面——木头查垛了。在这里没有手快、眼快、脚快的年青小伙子，是难以完成任务的。这天已经天黑了，吃饭哨吹一阵又一阵，拆垛的小伙子们都好像没有听见。他们飞一样地在激流中的木头上走来走去。他们在木头上听着一个粗壮的领头的工人的号音，唱着习惯的号子。在那个领头的工人的指挥下，没多长时间，只拆了几根木头，大批的木头就流下去了。这个工人叫贺立成。他说：这是最容易拆的垛，有时一查一万多立方公尺，不找到“垛眼”却拆几天也拆不开。这些人们不管下雪、下雨或者刮风，他们都不停息。他们说：一下雨就干得更带劲了。
      长白山走在前面
    去年八月，苏联林业专家依达诺夫来到了长白山林区。工人工作的时候，他看工人如何使用新式工具；工人休息的时候，他和工人闲扯，并参加工人的娱乐晚会。他离开长白山前，对这里的工作作了结论。他说：这些新式工具都是成功的，这是中国工人阶级高度智慧的表现。他对木轨道特别感到兴趣。他说：“在中国现在还缺乏钢铁的条件下，这种创造是十分有价值的，我建议用发明者的名字作为这些新式工具的名字。”几天后，东北林业部颁发了决定，通令把双轴滑杠命名为“田凤昌式运材器”，把木坦克命名为“周云章运材车”，把木制平车命名为“张书熙运材车”，把钢轨双轴滑杠命名为“李宝森运材器”，把自动爬犁命名为“孟照武运材器”，把单轴滑杠命名为“张增礼运材器”。这些新式工具的基本道理就是用铁轨或木轨铺在山坡上，把木材放在上面，从山上滑下来。这种工具看起来很简单，但它成为改进我国现在林业生产的关键——从季节性作业走向常年作业，使临时工人也固定下来了。
    东北开展增产节约运动的时候，辽东林业管理局负责同志问临江分局局长丛连兹说：“你们增产十万吨粮食的任务怎样呀？”这个数字使这个年青的分局长（一个过去的流送工人）作了很多考虑：这样季节性的作业，这样大的任务，是很难完成的。他问局长：“有没有足够的钢轨？”局长说：“那里有这样多的钢轨呀！努力找窍门吧。”丛连兹和总支书记李文昌作了多次研究，他们认为采伐没有多大问题，但运搬是很困难的。可是，他们也明白，只要依靠工人挖掘潜在力，困难是可以克服的。就这样，分局的多数干部都下去了，丛连兹和李文昌也下到车间，发动工人解决这个困难问题。
    他们来到工棚里，首先发动工人提问题。当时，工人提出了汇钱邮信没办法、吃不上菜等问题，他们都认真地给解决了。接着丛连兹和李文昌就动员工人搞生产节约，增产更多的木材，使大家将来的生活过得更好。大会小会，大组小组都讨论怎样找窍门。有的说：我们要随采随运。有的提出：木头不要抬，可以从山上往下拉。这时有个人创造了木滚子，把木头放在木滚子上面往下滚；有的把树枝桠铺在地上，从枝桠上往下滑。丛连兹从这里面看到了苗头：不用牛马运材有可能。他们召开了奖励大会。他在大会上动员大家少出力多干活，取消牛马式的劳动。这时丛连兹和李文昌只要听说那个工人有个很小的创造，都亲自跑到那里打听打听，并且鼓励他们。丛连兹有计划地支持了田凤昌（出席中国工会第七次全国代表大会的劳动模范），拨给他钢轨作试验，不仅从技术上支持他，还从政治上教育他。结果，他完整地创造了双轴滑杠。临江分局的创造多起来了，丛连兹和李文昌又成立了窍门委员会。之后，周云章的“木坦克”出来了，孟昭武的“自动爬犁”出来了，新式工具共出现了几十种，发明创造达到了第一个高潮。结果使东北林业工作由季节性的作业达到了工人说的“手工自动化”。
    当临江分局的创造发明达到高潮的时候，医院里躺着一个身材高大的老头子，这个人叫刘润起，是在林区工作三十年的老工人。他因这些创造发明在医院里住不下去了。他向院长提出了出院的要求。他回想着，三十年前，生活像鞭子一样把他从山东老家赶到东北来，当了林业工人。那时的警察恶棍嫌他说话难听，长相不好，经常打骂他。生活的鞭子，敌人的鞭子把他打过了鸭绿江东岸的朝鲜去。在朝鲜住了十八年，中国解放了，他又回到祖国来。他在病床上想着：有谁像党那样对待自己呢？有了病上级叫自己住医院，医院的护士比自己的女儿还亲；自己一辈子没有老婆，现在有这样多的好女儿。他越想这些，越觉着出去工作的重要。他想着：冬季运材要多少牛马呀，一个牲口一天要吃八斤料，要吃十斤到十五斤草。八个人抬一个小木头，有的还累得吐血。多少好木材因为抬不动被截短了；多少木材运不下来烂在山上了；多少人因抬木材负伤了。他还想着：很多同志都有了创造发明，我要使这创造再进一步。他想起十八年前在朝鲜作工时见到一种工具，用两块木头往下滑，很省劲；但记不清是怎样造的了。他想着：在两个木轨道上铺上枕木，上面放上个单轨，再用木马往下放，一定很好；有闸就更稳了。想到这里，他坚决向院长要求出院。他回去后仍然病着，人们又要往医院里送他。刘润起说：“搞不好工作，死在森林里也不回去；在‘家’总比在医院里强。我不能工作，我可以给大家分配工作。”他的病稍好了一些，就偷偷地在大家干活的时候造了个模型。这时丛连兹知道刘润起要创造了，就启发他。但刘润起怕失败了丢人，总是说“没有创造”。丛局长说：你如果需要什么，我们支持你。他最后才表示一定努力完成任务。他造的模型改了又改，给工人讲了又讲，试了又试，大家都说好，并叫他再做个大的。他又干起来了。木马的“马蹄”（木马下边的横木的底面）要用豆油浸浸，然后用火烤，才能硬而滑，他就自己拿钱去买油；做闸要用胶皮，他又跑到一百里外的临江去买胶皮。后来开始试验单轨木马，很多人都跑来看。老刘可紧张啦！从山上到山下四百多公尺远，第一次装了一立方公尺，他用绳子拉着闸，稳稳当当地放下去了。所有的观众都热烈地鼓掌。大家又叫他来第二趟。第二趟装了两立方公尺，又稳稳当当地下去了。最多的时候装到四立方公尺（用一套壮牲口也不过拉二立方公尺）。就这样，他们小组的工作效率从过去的每天点八立方公尺提高到一点三立方公尺。两个月他们小组采伐运输了一千立方公尺，只用了一根破胶皮轮胎和一百五十斤洋钉子。他们采伐的木头在几天内或者一天内就可以运出去了。这种新式工具比先前的六种创造更适合于我国现在林区的情况，不管在冬天或夏天，也不管春天和秋天，也不管下雪和下雨，在山的坡度百分之八到百分之三十都可应用，成本也最低。他们小组在那单轨木马的有节奏的运材声里，轻松愉快地完成了任务。
    学习采用刘润起单轨木马的还有另外的几个小组，都胜利地完成了任务。辽东森林工业局的创造从一个高潮达到了另一个高潮。东北森林工业局作出了决定，要在全东北大规模地推广刘润起的单轨木马。临江分局在他们的创造发明里实行了有历史意义的常年作业，超额完成了增产十万吨粮食的任务。
    辽东的新式工具已为长白山和小兴安岭等地林区的职工们广泛地接受了。来这里参观学习的人，对辽东的新工具都发生了浓厚的兴趣。黑龙江林业管理局的一位科长说：参观这几天，胜上几年林业学校。我彻底打破了非用牛马上山运材不行的思想，回去就可以减少担负四十万立方公尺运输任务的马套子。佳木斯林业管理局的工程师说：我作了四十年林业工作，第一次看到这样好的工具。辽东的新式工具不仅使东北少用十万头牲口在那严寒里运输，还可以使木材早运到祖国建设的工地去。在常年作业里，这里工人的生活福利问题也美满地解决了。
       欢乐的长白山
    五月初，我沿鸭绿江走向长白山林区的深处。我国南方的小麦已经收割完毕了，这里还是春天。高山的背面还有积雪，黄牛在长白山下耕田。再往里走便是漫江村。
    漫江，人们都称她为“工人新村”，其实她已有几十年的历史了。在解放以前，这里住着几户靠狩猎为生的朝鲜族人民，他们的生活是很苦的。在解放之后，在国家经济建设开始的时候，小小的漫江村一下子添了几百家工人家属；那几排长长的新瓦房和马路，使漫江更好看了。
    山林里面的春天没有风沙。工人们这些天来正在休息，从山里回到家里来，有的种种青菜，有的抱着娃娃在干净的院落里散步。孩子的妈妈和一些新娘子，有的在屋里做活，有的在江边洗花布衫。我们走进妇联会主任于志杰的家里。她丈夫正看着摇篮里的孩子。她刚买来猪肉给丈夫做肉饼；因为今天晚上他就要回到山里采伐去了。于志杰掀开花门帘让我们进去。干净的炕上放着几床花被子，洁白的墙壁上贴着彩画，在另一块白布幔的下面是一袋子一袋子的食粮。她说：日子过好了，不想要孬东西了，合作社里没有好暖壶，你们渴就给你们烧水喝。于志杰的丈夫说：不解放我还不是跑一辈子腿
    （东北称“打光棍”为“跑腿子”）呀！我现在却有了这样一个小学教员做爱人。于志杰领我们到了隔壁吴玉春家里，她的家和于志杰的房屋一模一样。其实漫江工人家属的房屋都是一样的：一小间厨房，一大间卧室；玻璃窗上都拉着新布幔，一开窗子，充足的阳光就射进来了。我在这里看了很多工人的家庭，断定吴玉春家是个很普通的工人家庭。吴玉春家的陈设也和别家的陈设差不多，墙上一张斯大林像、一张毛主席像，一张爱国公约，还有“小二黑结婚全图”、“天河配”等年画；一个白布幔下面是几床新花被子。一张短桌上放着“速成识字法”、“中国共产党的三十年”、“政治课本”和日记本子，电灯匠正在安装电灯。一个红光满面的小伙子进来了。妇联会主任介绍说：“这是吴玉春的爱人赵永祥。你看人家配得多好呀！”吴玉春笑着说：“你们也好呀！”两个青年过去可都是苦人儿。吴玉春早早地失去了父母，跟着奶奶过日子。赵永祥七岁死了母亲，十三岁死了父亲，跟着两个哥哥给人家种地；哥哥下地做活他在家里做饭，做饭做不好，一面烧锅一面想妈妈，眼泪落在饭碗里，落在柴火上。解放后两个哥哥参军了，他在一九五○年到了林区。一九五一年夏天歇工时，他到了表哥家。第一次见面的表嫂对他说：“老三（即赵永祥），我妹妹说给你行不行？”赵永祥说：
    “我是跑腿的，家里啥也没有，谁要咱呀！”他表嫂说：“有了媳妇就不跑腿啦！我看您两个很合适。”去年二月赵永祥歇工又到了他表哥家。他去的第二天，他表嫂就把吴玉春叫来了。赵永祥一看这样个好姑娘，只怕人家不愿意。吴玉春一看赵永祥这样的好小伙，也怕他不愿意。还是赵永祥先问吴玉春：“你有意见没有？”吴玉春接着说：“我没有。”后来吴玉春又说：“你在车间里可别给人家闹意见呀！别落后呀！”赵永祥说：“你为什么没有参加青年团呢？”吴玉春说：“我不够格。”他们在一块吃了几天饭，熟悉了，就照了订婚像，没多久就结婚了。赵永祥拿着“速成识字法”来回掀了几下说：“现在我能认两千多字了，报纸、书也能看了，谁想到有现在呢？”他又接着说：“过去谁嫁给木把（即采伐工人）呀！现在可不一样了，光我们车间里就有二十个结婚的；现在找对象的可多啦！”吴玉春又接着说：“你看这几百家工人家属，还不都是这几年里面找的呀！”
    在采伐车间里，一切设备同样是令人满意的。赵永祥叙述着他们车间的情形：“现在每个车间都有洗澡塘，谁三天不洗澡也不行。还有专门洗衣服的。现在又决定每个人给个暖水壶、洗脸盆。早晨起来吃豆汁油条，中午是大米白面，每星期还要成个席。领导上照顾我们回民，给我们买牛羊肉、鱼肉。现在我们每天学习一个钟头，今年就要实行礼拜天。你看，一到休息的时候才热闹呢？演戏，弹琴，年轻的差不多都有口琴。那个工人都在银行里存着钱。”漫江的银行里的同志曾经告诉我，一月份只有奖储蓄就储蓄了一万四千号，一下子存几百万的并不希罕。
    在辽东林区，不仅是一个车间或仅仅漫江是这样。我们四个人在桦树工人食堂里吃了一顿饭，四菜一汤，有炒肉片、炒肉丝、炒鸡蛋、炒腰花，饭是大米、馒头，才化了一万三千元。长白山已经是自然的大花园了，这里的局长还要在桦树建立一个花园。他说：种籽已经都买来了。在花园里还要修个游泳池，夏天游泳、冬天滑冰。他们把奶牛买来了，奶羊买来了，把有名的北京鸭子也买来了；他们要养育一大群北京鸭种的鸭子，以便将来制板鸭。在很多地方，特别是林区，是经常吃不到猪肉的。在这里可以天天吃到新鲜的猪肉、羊肉和牛肉。他们自己种菜，在去年收了二十五万斤青菜。领导方面十分注意解决工人的生活问题，做饭的厨子都在训练班里训练过了。这里的幸福的快乐的生活，是这里的领导同志和工人一块想办法的结果。（完）
