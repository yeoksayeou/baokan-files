    Southwest Region Distributes Large Quantities of Farm Tools
    Helping Minority Nationalities with Production
    This year, the People's Government has been distributing large quantities of farm tools free of charge in various minority nationality areas in the Southwest, helping all brother nationalities improve farming methods and develop agricultural production.
    At the Economic Work Conference for Minority Nationality Areas held by the Southwest Administrative Committee last year, it was decided to distribute iron farm tools worth over 40 billion yuan free of charge to minority nationality people this year. After the meeting, Yunnan Province established "Committees for Improving Mountainous Agricultural Production" from the province and county levels down to key districts to manage the distribution of farm tools. They selected 292 key townships based on actual conditions, preparing to basically solve the farm tool problem in these townships this year; in addition, general subsidies will be provided to more than 2,500 townships. Xikang Province has distributed more than 47,000 pieces of farm tools to farmers in the Yi and Tibetan Autonomous Regions, and has focused on distributing 233 new-style farm tools such as walking plows, seeders, and disc harrows. The Tibetan Autonomous Region of Xikang Province has also sent more than 100 Tibetan cadres who have received specialized agricultural technical training to establish agricultural technical guidance stations in twelve counties to guide minority nationalities in learning how to use new farm tools. Guizhou, Yunnan and other places have organized a large number of blacksmith shops to rush-produce farm tools for minority nationalities, and to teach them the technology of manufacturing farm tools. After receiving new farm tools, the people in Mengsa Dam in the Lancang Lahu Autonomous Region of Yunnan Province went down the mountains to produce, reclaiming more than 100 mu of paddy fields and building three large canals. Now, many rice, cotton, pineapples, bananas and sugar cane have been planted on this land that has been barren for more than 60 years. (Xu Chuan)

    西南区发放大量农具
    帮助少数民族生产
    今年人民政府在西南各少数民族地区，无偿地发放大量农具，帮助各兄弟民族改进耕作方法，发展农业生产。
    西南区行政委员会去年召开的少数民族地区经济工作会议上，决定在今年无偿地以价值四百多亿元的铁制农具，发放给少数民族人民。会后，云南省从省、县直到重点区，都成立了“改进山区农业生产委员会”，管理农具发放工作。他们根据实际情况选择了二百九十二个重点乡，准备在今年基本上解决这些乡的农具问题；另外，对二千五百多个乡进行一般的补助。西康省已发放了四万七千多件农具给彝族、藏族自治区的农民，并有重点地发放了新式步犁、播种机、圆盘耙等新式农具二百三十三部。西康省藏族自治区还派出一百多个受过专门农业技术训练的藏族干部，深入到十二个县建立农业技术指导站，指导少数民族学会使用新农具。贵州、云南等地组织了大批铁匠炉为少数民族赶制农具，并传授制造农具的技术。云南省澜沧拉祜族自治区孟撒坝山里的人民得到新农具后，纷纷下山生产，开垦了一百多亩水田，修了三条大水渠。现在，这块荒芜了六十多年的土地上，已经栽种了许多水稻、棉花、菠罗、香蕉和甘蔗。    （许川）
