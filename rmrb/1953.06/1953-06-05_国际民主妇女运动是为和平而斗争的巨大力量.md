    The World Women's Congress is scheduled to be held in Copenhagen, the capital of Denmark, starting June 5. Women representatives from different races, political affiliations, and religious beliefs from around the world will discuss issues related to women's vital interests, such as defending peace, protecting women's rights, and safeguarding children at this conference. This is a major event in the International Democratic Women's Movement.

    The International Democratic Women's Movement began to form shortly after the end of World War II. Women from all countries who suffered the disasters of war during the war felt the urgent need to unite to defend peace and their own rights after the war ended. At the end of 1945, women representatives from 45 countries held the First World Women's Congress in Paris. The conference defined four tasks for the International Democratic Women's Movement: 1. Eliminate fascism, promote international cooperation, and establish lasting peace; 2. Organize women in various countries to defend their rights; 3. Protect children and youth; 4. Strengthen women's friendship and solidarity. The conference also decided to establish the Women's International Democratic Federation as a permanent body to lead the International Democratic Women's Movement. The Paris Conference marked a new historical stage in the world women's movement. Through the Women's International Democratic Federation, women from all countries organized themselves for the first time into a massive army of peace and democracy on a global scale. This conference also greatly elevated the women's movements in various countries, expanding their activities and influence.

    In December 1948, women representatives from various countries held the Second World Women's Congress in Budapest. At that time, the imperialist bloc headed by the United States had begun to form a new military aggression alliance and vigorously prepare for a new war. In response to this situation, people from various countries also mobilized to launch a broad peace movement. The Budapest Conference therefore emphasized the important role of women in the struggle to defend peace and the enormous tasks of women in defending peace. The conference passed the Declaration for the Defense of Peace, expressing the will of women from various countries to oppose a new war.

    Since the Budapest Conference, the International Democratic Women's Movement has further closely combined the struggle of women to defend peace and oppose new wars with the struggle to defend their vital rights and the welfare of children. Through these struggles, the International Democratic Women's Movement has rapidly grown into a formidable force. At the time of the Second World Women's Congress in 1948, the Women's International Democratic Federation had increased from 45 member countries at its founding to 56, with membership increasing by one-third to 80 million. Now, it has united 135 million organized women in 65 countries.

    When the First World Peace Congress was convened in 1949, the Women's International Democratic Federation was one of the main initiators. This congress began to form an organized world-scale peace movement. Since then, the Women's International Democratic Federation has actively mobilized and organized women from various countries to support various appeals for maintaining world peace.

    Under the promotion and organization of the Women's International Democratic Federation, women from various countries are contributing their strength to the struggle to defend peace in different ways. Women in the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and various people's democratic countries are strengthening the strength of the peace and democracy camp through creative labor. In Korea and Vietnam, women are bravely fighting against foreign invading armies alongside the people of the whole country, and they have created many heroic deeds on the front lines and in the rear.

    Women in capitalist countries are also actively participating in various struggles to defend peace. In the movement to collect signatures for the Stockholm Appeal to ban atomic weapons and the Declaration calling for the five major powers to conclude a peace pact, thousands of women have become active peace fighters. They are carrying out the struggle unyieldingly, regardless of the threats and persecution of the ruling authorities. Italian printing worker Marzi and her colleagues Anmore and Betoldo collected 12,000 to 17,000 signatures each for the Stockholm Appeal, and Indian woman Singh collected 25,000 signatures for the Peace Pact Declaration, which are shining examples among them.

    Women from all countries strongly demand an end to the Korean War and other wars of aggression, which are causing the husbands and sons of women in the United States and other countries to die for the benefit of monopoly capitalists. In the United States, women played a significant role in the movement to demand an end to the Korean War. They organized the "Save Our Sons Committee," which has now gained broad public support in the Midwestern United States. Many moving stories have emerged in the struggle of American women to demand a truce in Korea. For example, a Mrs. Shunna from San Francisco traveled from the west coast to the east coast to campaign for peace in Korea, and hundreds of American people wrote to her to support her efforts to win peace. In countries such as Britain and Canada that have sent troops to invade Korea, women have also launched a movement to bring their husbands and sons home. On June 25 last year, the second anniversary of the US invasion of Korea, British women held a large-scale demonstration in London demanding an end to the Korean War. Many relatives of British prisoners of war and soldiers in Korea came from all over the country to participate in the march. French women resolutely demand an end to the shameful war of aggression against Vietnam. The heroic act of the famous peace fighter Raymond Dien lying on the train tracks to prevent trains carrying munitions from going to Vietnam demonstrated the firm will to fight of French women. In Latin America, the slogan "Our sons will never go to war in Korea" shouted by the heroic Brazilian working woman Branco became the signal for a powerful protest movement in various countries. Women in Brazil, Cuba, Chile and other countries have risen up to fight alongside the people of the whole country, forcing the governments of some Latin American countries to abandon their plans to send troops to Korea.

    In West Germany and Japan, women actively participated in the struggle against re-militarization. West German women launched a movement against recruiting their sons to join the "European Army," which gained broad support from women in other European countries.

    In the vast colonial and semi-colonial areas of Asia and Africa, women also bravely participated in the struggle against the threat of war.

    Combining the struggle to defend peace, the Women's International Democratic Federation has carried out many activities to protect the vital rights of women and protect children. In capitalist countries and colonies, women are in a position of being deprived of political rights and discriminated against economically. The broad masses of women in these countries are fighting for their political and economic rights. Because war preparations have caused deep disasters for women and children, at the initiative of the Women's International Democratic Federation, 537 representatives of different political and religious beliefs from 61 countries held the International Conference for the Defense of Children in Vienna last spring. In preparing for this conference, national committees for the protection of children were established in 38 countries.

    The achievements of the International Democratic Women's Movement over the past seven years have been great. In order to further expand the united front of the international women's movement and attract the broadest masses of women from all countries to the movement to defend peace, defend women's rights, and protect children, the Women's International Democratic Federation decided to convene the World Women's Congress last December. So far, nearly 1,000 delegates from 80 countries have accepted the invitation of the Women's International Democratic Federation to participate in the conference, including 15 countries that are not yet members of the Women's International Democratic Federation. This unprecedented conference of great unity of women from various countries will undoubtedly further develop the International Democratic Women's Movement and make a greater contribution to the cause of defending world peace.

### 国际民主妇女运动是为和平而斗争的巨大力量

    国际民主妇女运动是为和平而斗争的巨大力量
    世界妇女大会定于六月五日起在丹麦首都哥本哈根举行。来自世界各国不同种族、不同政治和宗教信仰的妇女代表们，要在这次大会上讨论保卫和平、保卫妇女权利和保卫儿童等有关妇女切身利益的问题。这是国际民主妇女运动中的一件大事。
    国际民主妇女运动是在第二次世界大战刚结束以后就开始形成的。在大战中身受战争灾难的世界各国妇女，在大战结束以后，迫切地感到需要团结起来以保卫和平与她们的切身权利。一九四五年底，四十五个国家的妇女代表在巴黎举行了第一次世界妇女代表大会。大会确定了国际民主妇女运动的四项任务：一、消灭法西斯主义，促进国际合作，建立持久和平；二、组织各国妇女保卫她们的权利；三、保卫儿童和青年；四、加强妇女的友谊和团结。大会并决定成立国际民主妇女联合会，作为领导国际民主妇女运动的常设机构。巴黎大会标志了世界妇女运动的新的历史阶段。各国妇女通过国际民主妇女联合会第一次把自己组织成为一支全世界规模的和平民主力量的大军。这个大会也把各国的妇女运动大大提高了一步，扩大了它们的活动和影响。
    一九四八年十二月，各国妇女代表在布达佩斯举行了第二次世界妇女代表大会。当时以美国为首的帝国主义集团已开始着手组成新的军事侵略联盟，大力准备新的战争，针对这一形势，各国人民也纷纷动员起来展开了广泛的保卫和平运动。布达佩斯大会因此强调指出妇女在保卫和平斗争中的重要作用，和妇女在保卫和平斗争中的巨大任务。大会通过保卫和平宣言，表示了各国妇女反对新战争的意志。
    自布达佩斯大会以来，国际民主妇女运动进一步把妇女保卫和平、反对新战争的斗争和保卫她们切身权利和儿童福利的斗争密切地结合起来。通过这些斗争，国际民主妇女运动迅速地成长为一支声势浩大的力量。在一九四八年第二次世界妇女代表大会时，国际民主妇女联合会已从成立时的四十五个会员国增加到五十六个，会员人数增加了三分之一，达到八千万人。现在，它已团结了六十五个国家中一亿三千五百万有组织的妇女。
    一九四九年召开第一届世界拥护和平大会时，国际民主妇女联合会是主要发起者之一，这届大会开始形成了有组织的世界规模的和平运动。以后，国际民主妇女联合会积极地动员和组织各国妇女，支持维护世界和平的各项号召。
    在国际民主妇女联合会的推动和组织下，各国妇女以不同的方式在保卫和平的斗争中贡献着她们的力量。苏联、中华人民共和国、各人民民主国家的妇女，都在以创造性的劳动，来增强和平民主阵营的力量。在朝鲜和越南，妇女们和全国人民一道，英勇地打击着外国侵略军队，她们在前线和后方创造了许多英雄的事迹。
    资本主义国家的妇女们也积极参加保卫和平的各种斗争。在为禁止原子武器的斯德哥尔摩宣言和要求五大国缔结和平公约宣言征集签名的运动中，成千上万的妇女成为积极的和平战士。她们不顾统治当局的威胁和迫害，不屈不挠地进行着斗争。意大利印刷女工玛尔齐和她的工友安摩尔和倍托尔多，每人为斯德哥尔摩宣言征集了一万二千到一万七千个签名，印度妇女辛格为和平公约宣言征集了两万五千个签名，就是她们中间光辉的范例。
    各国妇女们强烈要求停止朝鲜战争及其他侵略战争，这些战争正使美国和其他国家妇女的丈夫和儿子为着垄断资本家的利益而死去。在美国，妇女在要求停止朝鲜战争的运动中起了很大的作用。她们组织了“拯救我们的儿子委员会”，这个团体现在已在美国中西部地区获得广大人民的支持。美国妇女在要求朝鲜停战的斗争中出现了许多动人的故事，例如旧金山有一个舒纳太太，她从美国西海岸跑到东海岸，为朝鲜的和平而奔走，千百个美国人民写信给她，支持她的争取和平的努力。在英国、加拿大等派有军队侵略朝鲜的国家，妇女们也展开了让她们的丈夫和儿子回家的运动。去年六月二十五日，当美国侵略朝鲜二周年时，英国妇女在伦敦举行了大规模的示威游行，要求停止朝鲜战争。许多在朝鲜的英国战俘和士兵的亲属从全国各地来参加了这次游行。法国妇女坚决要求停止可耻的侵略越南战争。著名的和平女战士雷蒙德·第安卧倒在火车轨道上，阻止运送军火到越南去的火车开行，这种英雄行为表明了法国妇女坚强的斗争意志。在拉丁美洲，英勇的巴西劳动妇女布兰柯喊出的口号“我们的儿子决不到朝鲜去打仗”，成了各国强大抗议运动的信号。巴西、古巴、智利和其他国家的妇女都和全国人民一道纷纷起来进行斗争，使拉丁美洲若干国家政府被迫放弃出兵朝鲜的计划。
    在西德和日本，妇女们积极参加了反对重新军国主义化的斗争。西德妇女展开了反对招募她们的儿子参加“欧洲军”的运动，这个运动获得欧洲其他国家妇女的广泛支持。
    在亚洲和非洲广大的殖民地和半殖民地区域，妇女们也勇敢地参加了反对战争威胁的斗争。
    结合着保卫和平的斗争，国际民主妇女联合会进行了许多保卫妇女切身权利和保卫儿童的活动。在资本主义国家和殖民地中，妇女都处于政治上被剥夺权利、经济上被歧视的地位，这些国家广大妇女正为争取她们的政治和经济权利而斗争。由于战争准备使妇女们和儿童们遭受深重的灾难，在国际民主妇女联合会发起下，六十一个国家不同政治和宗教信仰的五百三十七个代表，去年春天在维也纳举行了国际保卫儿童大会。在筹备这次大会时，三十八个国家成立了全国性的保卫儿童委员会。
    国际民主妇女运动七年多来的成就是伟大的。为了进一步扩大国际妇女运动的统一战线，吸引世界各国最广泛的妇女群众到保卫和平、保卫妇女权利和儿童的运动中来，国际民主妇女联合会在去年十二月决定召开世界妇女大会。到目前为止，已有八十个国家将近一千名代表接受国际民主妇女联合会的邀请参加大会，其中有十五个国家现在还不是国际民主妇女联合会的会员国。这个空前的各国妇女
    大团结的会议，无疑将使国际民主妇女运动进一步开展，对保卫世界和平事业作出更大的贡献。
