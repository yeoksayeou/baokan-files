    The Electoral System of People's Democratic Countries in Central and Southeastern Europe
    Zheng Jiuhao, Zhang Kejing
    At the present stage, the People's Democratic countries of Central and Southeastern Europe are countries of proletarian dictatorship, socialist-type countries. In these countries, the rule of landlords and capitalists has been overthrown, basic means of production and means of production have been taken over by the state, and power has been transferred to the hands of urban and rural laborers headed by the working class. Laborers exercise state power through their elected representative organs, suppress the resistance of the exploiting classes, consolidate national defense, and build a socialist economy to maximize the satisfaction of society's material and cultural needs.
    The nature of the laboring people's regime in the People's Democratic countries determines the democratic nature of the electoral system, and the democratic electoral system guarantees the thorough realization of the laboring people's regime.
    The electoral system of the People's Democratic countries, like the entire state system, exists and develops under new and more favorable historical conditions, in an international environment where the capitalist system has been further weakened and the socialist system has been further strengthened, under the domestic conditions where the democratic forces headed by the working class outweigh the reactionary forces, and with the support and assistance of the Soviet Union. Therefore, the working class that has seized power in these countries can realize the dictatorship of the proletariat in a new form—the form of people's democracy—and can implement a thorough democratic electoral system from the very beginning.
    The electoral system of the People's Democratic countries and the electoral system of the Soviet countries belong to the same type, both demonstrating socialist democracy.
    First, the election is universal. Before the war, these countries, like all bourgeois countries today, did not have genuine universal suffrage. At that time, due to various conditions and restrictions, the broad masses of working people were deprived of the right to vote. The 1938 Hungarian House of Representatives electoral law stipulated that only those who were 26 years old, had six years of residency, ten years of Hungarian citizenship, and had received more than six years of education were eligible to vote. The conditions for women to participate in elections were even higher: they had to be 30 years old, own property, be a university graduate, and have "borne three legitimate children." Now, citizens of the People's Democratic countries have the right to vote without any conditions or restrictions. According to the electoral law, all citizens, regardless of gender, ethnicity, race, religious belief, education level, property status, and residency period, enjoy the right to vote and be elected. In Poland and Czechoslovakia, anyone who is 18 years old has the right to vote, and anyone who is 21 years old has the right to be elected; in Bulgaria and Albania, anyone who is 18 years old has the right to vote and be elected; in Hungary, anyone who is 20 years old has the right to vote and be elected; in Romania, working people who are 18 years old have the right to vote, and working people who are 23 years old have the right to be elected. Thus, except for the mentally ill, those deprived of the right to vote by court judgment, and enemies of the people's democratic system (who account for only about one percent of the total population), about 99 percent of the residents over the age of 18 enjoy the right to vote, including workers, peasants, intellectuals, and the bourgeoisie. This proves that the election is thoroughly universal. Regarding why the bourgeoisie is not deprived of the right to vote, Lenin once said: "The issue of depriving the exploiters of the right to vote is a purely Russian issue, not a general issue of the dictatorship of the proletariat." "When it comes to restricting the right to vote, one should study the specific conditions of the Russian revolution and its special path of development... But it would be wrong to guarantee in advance that the future proletarian revolution in Europe will necessarily or mostly restrict the bourgeoisie's right to vote." ("Selected Works of Lenin," two-volume edition, Volume II, Chinese version, pages 450, 451) However, in the special circumstances of individual countries, this method of depriving exploiters of the right to vote is also necessary. Romania, for example, implemented the deprivation of the right to vote for all past and present exploiters in 1950. This measure was in line with Romania's reality and was a necessary response to the class enemies who attempted to overthrow the people's democratic system. As Lenin taught: "When the people are engaged in the final struggle with the exploiters, there can be no room for the exploiters to set foot in any organ of power." ("Selected Works of Lenin," two-volume edition, Volume II, Chinese version, page 316)
    Secondly, in all People's Democratic countries in Central and Southeastern Europe, all citizens with the right to vote participate in elections on an equal basis. For example, the Polish Constitution stipulates: "Women enjoy all electoral rights equal to those of men" (Article 83), "Active servicemen enjoy electoral rights completely equal to those of residents" (Article 84), and each voter has only one vote. This means that the electoral rights of every citizen with the right to vote are unrestricted and without any differences. In addition, different parts of the population do not have different representative quotas, so the division of electoral districts is also equal.
    Again, elections in the People's Democratic countries of Central and Southeastern Europe are direct. All organs of power, from township and town organs of power to the National Assembly, are directly elected by the voters. Voters can elect representatives who can best serve the people according to their own will. This ensures a close relationship between the electors and the elected, and the voters have the opportunity to supervise the work of the representatives.
    Finally, elections are conducted using secret ballots. Secret ballots ensure that voters can freely express their will without anyone knowing when voting. For this purpose, rooms are set up specifically for voting, and no one is allowed to enter during the voting except the voters. Anyone who interferes with the voting is breaking the law.
    The nomination of candidates in the People's Democratic countries of Central and Southeastern Europe is also the most democratic. Candidates are nominated by various political parties, trade unions, youth organizations, peasant organizations, and other mass organizations. Candidates from various political parties can be jointly nominated by the People's Front or nominated separately. Various people's organizations and other mass organizations can decide to nominate candidates themselves, or they can nominate candidates at workers' congresses, state farm member congresses, or army soldier congresses. Election expenses are borne by the state. The division of electoral districts and electoral sub-districts provides voters with great convenience. The election committee is composed of people's representatives and representatives of social organizations, so the people directly participate in the preparation and implementation of the election work. The counting of votes is stipulated to be subject to mass supervision. Representatives of the People's Front, various political parties, social organizations, and the press can attend, strictly preventing any fraudulent activity.
    Elections in the various People's Democratic countries have become the most extensive form of supervision by voters over the work of representatives and state organs. Representatives are the people's faithful servants, and the people's trust is the basis of all activities of the representatives. Representatives must regularly report to the people on their work and the work of the organs to which they belong. If the representative does not work according to the will of the voters or is incompetent, the voters can withdraw him before the expiration of his term through legal procedures. Regarding this point, Comrade Stalin said: "The representative should know that he is the servant of the people, the envoy sent by the people to the Supreme Soviet, and he should act according to the line instructed by the people. If the representative deviates from the right path, the electors have the right to demand a new election and have the right to tell this representative who has deviated from the right path to get out." (Speech at the voters' meeting in Stalin Electoral District, Moscow City, 1937) Comrade Stalin's instruction is fully applicable to the People's Democratic countries. The realization of this democratic principle strengthens the sense of responsibility of the representatives, improves the work of the representatives, and greatly enhances the prestige of the organs of power.
    From this, it can be seen that the electoral system of the People's Democratic countries is thoroughly democratic and essentially different from the electoral system of bourgeois countries. In modern bourgeois countries headed by US imperialism, "this banner of bourgeois democratic freedom has been thrown aside" ("Stalin's Speech at the 19th Party Congress"). The broad masses of people are indifferent and tired of elections. This situation also existed in the Central and Southeastern European countries before World War II. At that time, the Romanian people had a folk song that said: "God—save me from drought, disease, and elections!" Now, the people of the People's Democratic countries of Central and Southeastern Europe participate in elections very actively, from the preparation of the election to the calculation of the results. Every election has become a festival for the people. In various countries, voters who vote account for almost 98 percent of registered voters, so the representatives elected are mostly representatives of workers and peasants, the best sons and daughters of the people. Among the representatives elected by the Bulgarian National Assembly in 1946, there were 73 workers, 90 peasants, 3 engineers, 15 cooperative workers, and 6 writers and journalists. The majority of the representatives were outstanding anti-fascist fighters. Among the 402 members of the current Hungarian National Assembly, 180 are of worker origin, 124 are of peasant origin, and 97 are laboring intellectuals. From these figures, it can be seen that this regime truly belongs to the people headed by the working class.
    Elections in the People's Democratic countries of Central and Southeastern Europe are of great significance in national life and social life. It absorbs the broad masses of working people to participate in state management and ensures that the people's own representatives are elected to the state organs of power. Under the leadership of the Communist Party and the Workers' Party, the people have continuously improved their awareness in each election, thereby constantly consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat and promoting socialist construction.

    中欧、东南欧人民民主国家的选举制度
    郑九浩  张克敬
    中欧、东南欧人民民主国家在现阶段是无产阶级专政的国家，社会主义类型的国家。在这些国家里，地主资本家的统治已被推翻，基本的生产工具和生产资料已由国家掌握，政权转到了以工人阶级为首的城乡劳动者的手里。劳动者通过自己选出的代表机关来行使国家政权，镇压剥削阶级的反抗，巩固国防，建设社会主义的经济，以求最大限度地满足社会物质和文化的需要。
    人民民主国家劳动者政权的本质，决定了选举制度的民主性，而民主的选举制度又保证了劳动者政权的彻底实现。
    人民民主国家的选举制度，也和整个国家制度一样，是在一种新的更加有利的历史条件下存在与发展着的，是在战后资本主义体系进一步削弱和社会主义体系进一步强大的国际条件下，是在国内以工人阶级为首的民主力量胜过反动力量的条件下，是在苏联的支持和帮助下存在与发展着的。因此在这些国家中取得政权的工人阶级就可能用一种新的形式——人民民主的形式来实现无产阶级专政，就可能一开始就实行彻底民主主义的选举制度。
    人民民主国家的选举制度与苏维埃国家的选举制度属于同一类型，都表现了社会主义的民主主义。
    首先，选举是普遍的。战前这些国家如同现今一切资产阶级国家一样，是没有真正的普选的。在那时，由于各种各样的条件和限制，广大的劳动群众被剥夺了选举权。一九三八年匈牙利众议院的选举法规定年满二十六岁，有六年居住期限，十年匈牙利公民资格，并受过六年以上教育者，才有投票权。妇女参加选举的条件更高：年满三十岁，有财产，高等学校毕业，并须“生过三个合法的子女”。现在人民民主国家公民的选举权，不附有任何条件和限制，依选举法的规定，凡公民不分性别、民族、种族、宗教信仰、教育程度、财产状况及居住期限，都享有选举权与被选举权。在波兰和捷克斯洛伐克，凡年满十八岁者有选举权，年满二十一岁者有被选举权；在保加利亚和阿尔巴尼亚，凡年满十八岁者，有选举权和被选举权；在匈牙利，年满二十岁者有选举权和被选举权；罗马尼亚年满十八岁的劳动人民有选举权，年满二十三岁的劳动人民有被选举权。这样，除精神病患者、被法院判决褫夺选举权者以及人民民主制度的敌人外（这些人仅占居民总数百分之一），在十八岁以上的占百分之九十九左右的居民，都享有选举权，其中包括工人、农民、知识界和资产阶级。这证明了选举是彻底普遍的。关于为什么不剥夺资产阶级选举权这一点，列宁曾说：“剥夺剥削者的选举权问题，是纯粹俄国的问题，而不是一般无产阶级专政的问题”“论到限制选举权问题时，就应该研究俄国革命底特殊条件及其发展的特殊道路……但如果预先担保说，欧洲将来的无产阶级革命，必定是全部或大部分都要限制资产阶级底选举权，那就会是错误的了。”（“列宁文选”两卷集，第二卷，中文本四五○、四五一页）但在个别国家特殊的情况下，这种剥夺剥削者选举权的办法也是必要的。像罗马尼亚就在一九
    五○年实行了剥夺一切过去与现在剥削分子的选举权。这种措施是切合罗马尼亚实际的，是给企图推翻人民民主制度的阶级敌人的必要的回答。正如列宁所教导的：“当人民与剥削者作最后斗争的关头，在任何一个政权机关中都决不能有剥削者插足的余地。”（“列宁文选”两卷集，第二卷，中文本三一六页）
    其次，中欧、东南欧各人民民主国家，凡具有选举权的公民，都在平等的基础上参加选举。例如：波兰宪法规定：“妇女享有与男子同等的一切选举权”（八十三条），“现役军人享有与居民完全平等的选举权”（八十四条），而每一选民只有一个投票权，这就是说，每一个具有选举权的公民的选举权利是不受限制的，也没有任何差别。另外，居民各种不同的部分没有各种不同的代表名额，所以选举区的划分也是平等的。
    再次，中欧、东南欧人民民主国家选举是直接的。凡一切政权机关，从乡镇政权机关直到国民议会，都由选民直接选举产生。选民可以按照自己的意志，选举最能为人民服务的代表。这就保证了选举人与被选举人之间有密切的联系，选民有可能监督代表的工作。
    最后，选举是采用秘密投票方式进行的。秘密投票保证选民在投票时能自由表达自己的意志而不让任何人知道，为此，还设立了专供投票用的房间，在投票时除了选民外，不许任何人入内。任何人有干涉投票的行为，都是犯法的。
    中欧、东南欧人民民主国家候选人的提出也是最民主的。候选人由各政党、职工会、青年团体、农民团体以及其他群众组织提出。各政党候选人可由人民阵线共同提出，也可以单独提出。各人民团体及其他群众组织，可以自行决定提出候选人，也可在职工大会上、国营农庄庄员大会上或军队士兵大会上进行候选人的提名。选举费用由国家来担负。选举区和选举分区的划分，更给予选民以很大的便利。选举委员会是由人民代表和社会团体的代表组成的，这样人民就直接参加了选举的筹备和实施工作。在计算选票时规定了群众的监督，人民阵线、各政党、社会团体和新闻界的代表都可列席，严格防止任何舞弊的情事。
    各人民民主国家的选举，已成为选民对代表的工作和国家机关工作的最广泛的监督方式。代表是人民忠实的勤务员，人民的委托是代表全部活动的基础。代表要定期向人民报告自己的工作和自己所在机关的工作。如果代表不按选民的意志进行工作或者不称职时，选民可以用法定的手续在任期届满前把他撤回。关于这一点，斯大林同志说过：“当代表的人应当知道：他是人民的公仆，是人民派往最高苏维埃的使者，他应当遵循人民所训示他的路线来动作。如果代表竟离开正轨，选举人就有权要求实行新选举，就有权叫这种离开正轨的代表滚开。”（一九三七年在莫斯科城斯大林选区选民大会上的演说）斯大林同志的这个指示，是完全适合于人民民主国家的。这种民主原则的实现，加强了代表的责任心，改善了代表的工作，大大提高了政权机关的威信。
    由此可知，人民民主国家的选举制度是彻底民主的，和资产阶级国家的选举制度有本质的区别。在以美帝国主义为首的现代资产阶级国家里，“资产阶级民主自由的这面旗帜已被抛在一边了”（“斯大林在第十九次党代表大会上的演说”），广大的人民对选举表示冷淡，厌倦，这种情况在第二次世界大战以前的中欧、东南欧各国也存在过，当时罗马尼亚人民有一首民谣说：“上帝——救我免于旱灾，疾病和选举！”而现在中欧、东南欧人民民主国家的人民参加选举，从选举的筹备到计算选举进行的结果都是非常积极的，每次选举都变成了人民的节日。投票的选民在各国都几乎占登记的选民百分之九十八左右，因而选出的代表绝大多数都是工农的代表，人民最优秀的儿女。一九四六年保加利亚国民大会所选出的代表中，有工人七十三人，农民九十人，工程师三人，合作社工作者十五人，作家记者六人等，代表中的多数人都是反法西斯的优秀战士。匈牙利现在的国民议会中四百零二位议员里，工人出身的有一百八十人，劳动农民出身的有一百二十四人，劳动知识分子有九十七人。从这些数字中可以看出这个政权是真正属于以工人阶级为首的人民的政权。
    中欧、东南欧人民民主国家的选举，在国家生活与社会生活中是具有伟大意义的。它吸收了广大的劳动群众参加国家管理，保证把人民自己的代表选到国家政权机关中去。人民在共产党与工人党的领导下，在各次的选举中，一次比一次提高了觉悟，从而不断地巩固着无产阶级专政，推动着社会主义的建设。
