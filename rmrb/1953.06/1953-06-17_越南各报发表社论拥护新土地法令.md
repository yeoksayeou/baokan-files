Xinhua News Agency, June 16th: According to Vietnam News Agency, the Vietnamese "People's Weekly", "Cuu Quoc" (Salvation), "Lao Dong" (Labor) and "Doc Lap" (Independence) newspapers have published editorials supporting the new land law recently promulgated by the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

	The "People's Weekly", the organ of the Vietnam Workers' Party, said in its editorial: The promulgation of the new land law has very important political significance. It proves that President Ho Chi Minh and the government are constantly concerned about the living conditions of the people, especially the peasants. It makes people realize that the land policy of the Party and the government truly lies in guaranteeing the interests of the peasants, and is completely different from the so-called "land reform" policy of the French colonialists and their puppets. The editorial pointed out that fully implementing the land policy will guarantee the victory of the war of resistance.

	"Cuu Quoc" (Salvation), the organ of the Vietnam National United Front, pointed out the importance of implementing the new land law in its editorial. The editorial said that people of all strata of the country will resolutely support the peasants' struggle against the rule of feudal landlords.

	The "Lao Dong" (Labor) newspaper, the organ of the Vietnam General Confederation of Labor, said in its editorial: The physical and mental laborers of Vietnam wholeheartedly support the new land law of President Ho Chi Minh and the Vietnamese government. The implementation of the new land law will further strengthen the alliance between workers and peasants and promote the war of resistance and the democratic and national revolution of Vietnam. The working people of Vietnam will do their best to support and participate in the struggle of the peasants in order to realize this land policy.
