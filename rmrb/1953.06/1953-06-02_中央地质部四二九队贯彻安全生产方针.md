    Central Geological Department Team 429 Implements Safety Production Policy
    The Central Geological Department's Team 429 has reversed its disregard for safety in production and has begun to implement the production policy of "safety first" in an organized and planned manner.
    After Team 429 launched large-scale drilling operations, all personnel were completely ignorant of the rules of this new work, simply emphasizing footage, resulting in frequent accidents that greatly affected the completion of the production plan. From May 1952 to February 20, 1953, a total of 1,658 accidents of varying degrees occurred, resulting in a direct loss of 1.86 billion yuan. The indirect impact on footage, injuries, and deaths were impossible to calculate.
    From mid-February to early March this year, Team 429 comprehensively carried out safety and hygiene inspections, severely criticized the erroneous thinking of cadres who did not pay attention to safety, and educated the masses through concrete facts. Initially, leading cadres took the lead in examining safety awareness, then it went down level by level, all the way to each worker. Because the inspection emphasized the exposure and criticism of erroneous thinking, the causes of accidents were thoroughly revealed.
    The serious bureaucracy of the leading cadres and their neglect of safety awareness were the main causes of accidents. Leading cadres regarded safety and production as contradictory, one-sidedly emphasizing footage, and usually lacked safety production education for workers. The abandoned hole accident on Drilling Rig No. 18 and the shell explosion accident in the repair shop occurred because leading cadres had not delved into the situation in advance to help solve technical difficulties; after the accidents occurred, leading cadres did not give the necessary attention, let alone educate the workers. Some drilling rigs were overheating, but the leading cadres did not investigate deeply to find the cause, simply saying that it was normal for new machines to overheat, resulting in serious downhole accidents. The workers of Team 429 came from all over, and their thoughts and emotions were inconsistent. Coupled with the lack of strict labor discipline education for them, many phenomena of disorganization, indiscipline, blind recklessness, disobedience to command, and failure to follow operating procedures occurred in their work. It was very common for workers to step across belts and climb scaffolding. Wang Mingrun of Drilling Rig No. 6 climbed the scaffolding on the steel cable; Zheng Sihui, a worker of Team 3, started the drilling rig without authorization on a public holiday while watching the site with a health worker. In particular, some demobilized soldiers did not pay attention to safety in production at all. They said, "How can there be soldiers who don't fight, how can there be machine operators who don't have accidents!" The arrogance, complacency, and carelessness of grassroots cadres also hindered the implementation of the safety production policy. When Drilling Rig No. 18 of Team 2 was less than one meter into the opening, squad leader Zhang Shanxiu discovered that the hole was inclined by one degree and suggested improvements to the machine operator Jiang Junshan, but Jiang refused to accept the suggestion, resulting in a serious abandoned hole accident of 113 meters. Substandard technical installation equipment, poor material supply, and lack of practical operating experience were also important factors causing accidents. Judging from the inspection results of Team 1, more than two-thirds of the 210 machine accidents were caused by unstable foundations, careless installation, large machine vibration, and broken diesel engine pipes. The entire team lacked casing, and the parts for 22 Soviet-style drilling rigs were distributed for use on 30 drilling rigs. There were more new workers and fewer old workers, and they were not skilled, often causing downhole accidents such as stuck drills, dropped drill bits, and drill pipes. According to the inspection results of Team 1, such accidents accounted for more than 50 percent.
    The causes of accidents unearthed by layer-by-layer inspections greatly educated grassroots cadres and the vast number of workers. For example, Gao Zhenbin, the machine operator of Machine No. 27 in Tieshan District, actively and proactively conducted inspections among all drilling rig workers after mobilizing everyone to conduct inspections. Xiao Lihua of the repair shop said, "I worked for more than ten years in the old society, and I never heard anyone mention safety in production; only in the new society can workers be cared for in this way." Because the workers' awareness was raised, they not only examined their past disregard for safety, but also consciously exposed long-hidden work-related injuries and downhole machine accidents. For example, Team 3's Machine No. 10 reported only 12 accidents in 1952, but the first inspection revealed 35 accidents, and the second inspection increased to 38 accidents. The repair shop originally reported no accidents, but the first inspection found 156 accidents, and the final number increased to 248 accidents. Through this voluntary disclosure by workers, accidents that had been concealed and unreported in the past were uncovered. Through this inspection, the work responsibility, safety inspection, accident reporting, shift handover, production command, machine repair, and other systems were further clarified and established. Mass security organizations were universally established during the inspection. Each drilling rig elected a safety and hygiene team of three to four people through mass elections. Each lathe elected one security officer. Security branches and teams were established in each detachment and workshop. After mass discussions, Team 2 proposed ten key points in work and thinking, and clearly stipulated eight labor disciplines. This is a powerful guarantee for consolidating the inspection results. In the spirit of solving problems while inspecting, Team 429 stipulated the solutions and timing for the problems that should be solved, and determined which level of organization should solve them. For example, problems belonging to the brigade level were resolved by convening a management committee after the inspection. The same was true for detachments and workshops. After the detachments and workshops inspected, they summarized and announced the results to the masses. After the inspection, fire-resistant sand, fire-resistant hooks, machine guards, safety belts, and safety helmets were immediately added. The lack of casing was the main reason affecting safety in production. Team 429 has actively trial-produced mud mixers to solve this difficulty, and has now initially succeeded. The installation of Drilling Rig No. 19 was incorrect. After inspection, it was immediately stopped and reinstalled, changing the original measures, and safety was guaranteed.
    After the safety production policy was gradually implemented, accidents in Team 429's drilling operations began to decrease, and footage continued to increase. On April 28, Tieshan District had exceeded its April drilling plan by 2.68 percent. (Qi Tao)

    中央地质部四二九队贯彻安全生产方针
    中央地质部四二九队扭转不重视安全生产的思想，开始有组织地、有计划地贯彻安全第一的生产方针。
    四二九队开展大规模钻探工作以后，全体人员对于这个新的工作的规律完全不懂，单纯强调进尺，以致事故频繁，大大地影响了生产计划的完成。从一九五二年五月到一九五三年二月二十日止，共发生大小事故一千六百五十八次，直接损失十八亿六千万元，间接影响进尺和造成伤亡等，无法计算其损失。
    今年二月中旬到三月上旬，四二九队全面开展安全卫生检查工作，严厉地批判了干部不重视安全的错误思想，并通过具体事实，教育了群众。开始领导干部带头检查安全思想，以后层层下去，一直到每一个工人。由于检查中强调了对错误思想的揭发、批判，彻底暴露了事故产生的原因。
    领导干部的严重官僚主义和忽视安全思想，是事故产生的主要原因。领导干部把安全和生产对立看待，片面强调进尺，平时对工人缺乏安全生产的教育。十八号钻机废孔事故和修配车间炮弹爆炸事故的发生，是由于领导干部事先没有深入了解情况，帮助解决技术上的困难；事故发生以后，领导干部也没有给以应有的重视，更没有向工人群众进行教育。有的钻机发热，领导干部没有深入检查，发现原因，即说新机器发热是常事，以致造成严重的孔内事故。四二九队的工人来自各方，大家思想情绪不一致，加上缺乏对他们的严密的劳动纪律的教育，因此，工作中发生很多无组织无纪律、盲目乱干、不听指挥、不按操作规程工作的现象。工人跨皮带、爬三角架的情况，非常普遍。六号钻机王明润攀着钢丝绳上的三角架；三队工人郑四惠在公休日，和卫生员看现场，擅自开动了钻机。特别是有些转业军人，对安全生产的事根本不注意。他们说：“那有当兵不打仗，那有管机器不出事故的呢！”基层干部骄傲自满，麻痹大意，也妨碍了安全生产方针的贯彻和执行。二队十八号钻机在开孔钻进不到一公尺时，班长张善修发现孔斜一度，向机长姜俊山提出改进建议，而姜竟不接受建议，结果造成一一三公尺的严重废孔事故。技术安装设备不合规格，材料供应不好，缺乏实际操作经验，也是造成事故的一个重要因素。从一队检查结果来看，在二一○次机器事故中，三分之二以上的事故是因地基不稳，安装不慎，机器震动大，柴油机气管折断损坏而造成的。全队套管缺乏，以二十二部苏联式钻机配件，分配给三十部钻机使用。新工人多，老工人少，技术不熟练，经常发生卡钻、掉钻头、钻杆等机器孔内事故。一队检查的结果，这类事故在百分之五十以上。
    层层检查所发掘的事故产生的原因，对基层干部和广大职工教育很大。如铁山区二十七号机机长高震斌，在动员大家进行检查以后，积极主动向全钻机工人进行检查。修配车间萧立华说：“我在旧社会干十几年，从没有听人提过安全生产；只有新社会，才能这样关心工人。”由于职工觉悟提高，不仅对过去不注意安全的思想进行了检查，对过去隐瞒很久的工伤机器孔内事故也都自觉地揭露出来。如第三队十号机一九五二年报事故只有十二次，到第一次检查时即发现是三十五次，第二次检查增加到三十八次。修配车间原报没有发生事故，但第一次检查即查出一五六次，最后增加到二四八次。经这次职工自动揭发，把全队过去九分之八隐瞒没有报的事故，都检查出来了。通过这次检查，又进一步明确和建立了工作责任、安全检查、事故报告、交接班、生产指挥、机器检修等制度。在检查中普遍建立了群众性的保安组织，每部钻机都经群众选举产生三人至四人的安全卫生小组。每部车床选举了保安员一人。各分队及车间均成立了保安分会和小组。第二队群众讨论后，提出工作上和思想上十大要点，并明确规定了劳动纪律八条。这对巩固检查成果是有力的保证。在边检查边解决问题的精神下，四二九队把应解决的问题，规定了解决的办法和时间，并确定那一级组织解决。如属于大队的，在检查后，即召开管理委员会解决。属于分队和各车间的，也是这样。在分队和车间检查以后，都先后总结并向群众公布。在检查之后，立即增设了防火砂、防火钩、机器防护罩、保险皮带、保险帽。套管缺乏，是影响安全生产的主要原因，四二九队已积极试制泥浆搅拌器来解决这个困难，现已初步试制成功。十九号机钻机安装不正，经检查立即停止，重新安装，改变了原来的措施，安全得到了保障。
    在安全生产方针逐步贯彻之后，四二九队钻探工作中的事故开始减少，进尺不断增加。铁山区在四月二十八日，已超额百分之二点六八完成了四月份全月的钻探计划。    （戚涛）
