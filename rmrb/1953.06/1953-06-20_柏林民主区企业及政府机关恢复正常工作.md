Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, June 19th (TASS dispatch): The riots, planned and arranged by foreign adventurers, did not receive support from broad sections of the people in Berlin. The purpose of this riot was to disrupt the normal life of the democratic sector of Berlin.

    After martial law was imposed on East Berlin on the 17th, the fascist provocateurs fled to West Berlin. Those caught on the spot have been handed over for trial.

    All industrial enterprises and state and municipal organs in Berlin have resumed normal work.

    In some other cities, attempts were also made to create disturbances, and all were scheduled for the same time. However, the hired agents were unable to realize the plans of the secret organizers of this gamble.

    柏林民主区企业及政府机关恢复正常工作
    【新华社十九日讯】塔斯社柏林十九日讯：按照外国冒险分子的计划布置的骚乱没有得到柏林人民广泛阶层的支持。这个骚乱的目的是破坏柏林民主区的正常生活。
    十七日，东柏林实施戒严后，法西斯挑衅者就逃往西柏林，那些当场抓获的已交付审判。
    柏林一切工业企业及国家和市政机关已恢复正常工作。
    在其他一些城市也有人企图制造骚动，而且都是定在同一个时间。但是，被雇佣的特务分子并没有能够实现这次赌博的秘密的组织者的计划。
