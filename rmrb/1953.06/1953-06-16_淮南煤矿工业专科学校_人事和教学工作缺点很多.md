Many shortcomings in personnel and teaching work

A joint letter from staff and many students of Huainan Coal Mining Industry Technical School: There are many shortcomings in our school's work. The current number of staff exceeds the established quota by more than one-third, and many people are idle with nothing to do. As one comrade said in a letter to the school's Party committee: "I have been at the technical school for a year, and have only worked for eighty-four hours." With the exception of a few comrades, most comrades in the Political Counseling Office work less than two hours a day. There are also many problems in teaching. The physics teacher in the civil engineering department stubbornly brought the five-year physics curriculum from Harbin Institute of Technology to the two-year technical school, which the students cannot accept. The electrical engineering department is severely lacking teachers, and the learning effect is very poor. In the face of a serious shortage of teachers, the school has opened a geology department that it cannot afford to run. The students see that the country urgently needs technical personnel, but they cannot learn what they should be learning. The school's method of remedying the low academic performance is to have each teacher give us a dozen or twenty questions before the exam, and then choose four or five of these questions for the exam. In this way, although we get a passing grade or four or five points, in reality we have not learned many of the things we should have learned.

The leading cadres of our school do not welcome opinions from students, and even adopt extremely wrong attitudes. The students of Geology Class B once jointly wrote a letter to the Central Government, raising opinions on the school's teaching work. The Political Counseling Office told the students who signed the letter: "Doing this is unorganized and undisciplined. You should have first gone through us when writing the letter." They even demanded that the students write self-criticisms. When the East China Education Department sent people to our school to understand the situation, the Political Counseling Office designated students to talk to them, preventing other students from expressing their opinions. We hope that the higher-level education departments will resolve the above issues.

专栏：读者来信摘要

    淮南煤矿工业专科学校
    人事和教学工作缺点很多
    淮南煤矿工业专科学校工作人员和许多同学联名来信：我校各项工作缺点很多。现有工作人员已超过编制三分之一，好多人闲着没事做。正如一位同志给学校党委的信说：“到工专已一年了，只做了八十四小时的工作”。政治辅导处除少数同志外，大部分同志每天工作不到二小时。在教学方面问题也很多。土木科物理老师硬把五年制的哈尔滨工业大学的物理教程搬到二年制的专科学校来，同学们接受不了。电工科因缺乏教师，学习效果很差。在教师严重缺乏的情况下，学校却又开办了无力开办的地质系。同学们眼看着国家迫切需要技术人材，但自己却学不到应学的东西。学校补救学习成绩过低的办法，就是在考试前，由各教课先生给我们十几个或二十几个题，然后从这些题中选考四、五个。这样我们虽然得到及格或四、五分，但实际上却是没有学到应该学到的很多东西。
    我校领导干部对待来自学生中的意见是不欢迎的，甚至采取极端错误的态度。地质乙班的同学曾联名写信给中央，对学校教学工作提出了意见，政治辅导处便向签名的同学说：“你们这样做是无组织无纪律，写信的时候应该首先通过我们。”甚至还要同学写检讨书。华东教育部派人来我校了解情况，政治辅导处指定同学去谈话，不让其他同学去发表意见。上述问题，我们希望上级教育部门予以解决。
