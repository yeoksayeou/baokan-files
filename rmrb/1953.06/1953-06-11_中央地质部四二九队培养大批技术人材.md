Central Geological Department Team 429 has cultivated a large number of technical talents in surveying and mapping, geology, trenching, drilling, chemical analysis, and other fields through a mass technical learning movement carried out in practical work over eleven months.

The exploration work in the Tieshan Mining Area is a very large-scale project. The Central Geological Department transferred personnel needed for the project to Team 429 from Northeast, East China, and Central South China. However, skilled technicians and technical cadres accounted for only slightly less than sixteen percent of these personnel. The majority were recent graduates, demobilized soldiers, and apprentices who had been learning techniques for only a short time. Faced with this situation, the Communist Party organization of the team proposed the policy of vigorously cultivating technical talents in practical work in order to quickly complete the exploration task.

Team 429 used various forms to organize all employees to engage in technical learning. They established a regular technical learning system, with technical personnel taking time out from their work to write lecture notes and giving regular technical lessons. Geological personnel and drilling personnel made a summary after completing each drill, drawing technical experience and lessons from it. They organized more than ninety-five percent of the employees to widely enter into apprenticeship contracts. Each drilling team also established a technical research group. When encountering special circumstances in practical work, they were handed over to the technical research group for study. On the one hand, difficulties in the work were resolved, and on the other hand, workers learned techniques. After receiving systematic political education, the employees of Team 429 demonstrated a high degree of patriotism in learning techniques. They worked all day in the mountains, but the technical learning at night never stopped. Technical personnel often worked late into the night to write lecture notes for the trainees. Mi Houjun, the captain of drill rig No. 7, because the apprentices had a low level of education and could not understand technical theory, he operated together with the apprentices, lecturing while doing. In this way, his daily working hours often exceeded ten hours. The apprentices' enthusiasm for learning techniques was even higher. The seventh drill rig had a total of twenty-four workers, who purchased twelve copies of "Introduction to Drilling" from the Northeast Xinhua Bookstore at one time for self-study.

Through systematic technical learning, Team 429 has cultivated a large number of technicians and technical cadres. For example, the number of drilling equipment has increased more than six times since the initial start of work. Now, the captain, vice-captain, and technicians of each drilling rig are all equipped by newly trained technical personnel, and they are all complete. Each team has also added technical cadres such as recorders, material clerks, and assistants. For example, in the second drilling team, seventy-five out of seventy-eight cadres above the rank of squad leader were newly trained from technicians and apprentices. The number of technical cadres and technicians in the team has reached sixty-eight percent of the total number of people. The rapid growth of technical strength has greatly improved the work efficiency of Team 429. The current drilling speed has increased five times compared to the average in May of last year, and the core recovery rate has also increased by fifty percent.

This year, Team 429 has undertaken an even greater task of cultivating technical talents. They plan to train one thousand geological exploration technical talents for the country within one year. (Ma Guang)

    中央地质部四二九队培养大批技术人材
    中央地质部四二九队，在实际工作中开展群众性的学技术运动，经过十一个月的时间，已培养出了大批测绘、地质、槽探、钻探、化验等各种技术人材。
    铁山矿区勘探工作是一个规模十分庞大的工程，中央地质部从东北、华东、中南各地为四二九队调集了工程需要的人员，但这些人员中熟练的技工和技术干部仅占百分之十六弱，其余大部是刚从学校毕业的学生、转业军人和学习技术不久的徒工。面对这种情况，该队共产党的组织即提出在实际工作中大力培养技术人材的方针，以便迅速完成勘探任务。
    四二九队用多种形式组织全体职工进行技术学习。他们建立了经常的技术学习制度，由技术人员在工作中抽出时间编写讲义，定期上技术课。地质人员和钻探人员每打完一个钻就作一次小结，从中吸取技术上的经验教训。他们组织了百分之九十五以上的职工广泛地订立了师徒合同。各个钻探队又都成立了技术研究组。在实际工作中遇到特殊情况，就交技术研究组研究。一方面解决工作上的困难，另一方面工人又学到了技术。四二九队的职工们，受过系统的政治教育后，在学习技术上表现了高度的爱国主义精神。他们整天工作在山岭上，夜晚的技术学习却从来没有间断。技术人员们，为了给学员编写讲义，经常工作到深夜。第七号钻机机长宓厚君，因为学徒的文化水平低，对技术理论听不懂，他就同学徒一起操作，边做边讲，这样他每天的工作时间常在十小时以上。徒工学习技术的热情更高，第七号钻机共有二十四个工人，他们一次就向东北新华书店购买了十二本钻探概论，进行自修。
    通过系统的技术学习，四二九队培养了大量的技术工人和技术干部。如钻机设备较初开工时增加了六倍多，现在每部钻机的正副机长和技工都由新培养起来的技术人员来配备，而且都齐全。各队还增设了记录员、材料员和助理员等技术干部。如第二钻探队，七十八个班长以上的干部中，有七十五人是从技工和徒工新培养起来的，该队技术干部和技工的人数已达总人数的百分之六十八。技术力量的迅速成长，使四二九队的工作效率大为提高，目前的钻进速度较去年五月平均提高了五倍，岩心采取率也提高了百分之五十。
    今年，四二九队担任了更大的培养技术人材的任务。他们计划，一年内为国家培养一千个地质勘探的技术人材。  （马光）
