The Engineering Director of a Construction Site

The "Gudok" newspaper published an editorial on May 28th, outlining the points that a good engineering director should pay attention to. The abstract is as follows:

Engineer Zhelezny Ivan Gavrilovich enjoys the reputation of "the best engineering director" in the Siberian Railway Construction Trust. The entire construction team he leads consistently overfulfills its tasks, and the quality of the projects delivered is always excellent.

In transportation construction, there are many such advanced engineering directors. They lead while also learning, broadening their horizons, and actively participating in social activities. The engineering director is the leader of production technology and the conveyor of advanced engineering ideas. He has the responsibility to implement all progressive initiatives from scientists, engineers, and Stakhanovite construction workers.

The constant improvement of technical knowledge is the primary requirement for an engineering director. This is especially important now that construction sites are equipped with many mechanical devices, from electric planers, electric drills, and water pumps to powerful tower cranes, excavators, bulldozers, and pavers. Understanding machines, teaching people to use them, and cultivating people's interest in mechanization are among the most important tasks of an engineering director.

The engineering director is also an organizer who widely adopts advanced labor methods. His responsibility is to ensure that every initiative quickly gains the support of all employees and that young workers can learn from experienced construction workers.

In construction, as in other production sectors, properly establishing grassroots plans is a prerequisite for achieving high labor productivity. If the engineering director there helps his employees develop weekly and daily plans, so that people know in advance what tasks they should complete, then people will not waste time every morning on allocating manpower and arranging work, and they will definitely achieve results. Weekly and daily work instruction charts are an efficient plan for organizing weekly work. When participating in the formulation of plans, the engineering director should use his talents to be good at discovering the potential for improving labor productivity and overcoming difficulties.

In our country, there are also engineering directors who work in the field who have not received technical education. They especially need to enrich their knowledge through learning.

Some engineering directors, when implementing technical leadership on construction sites, also have to deal with many economic and administrative affairs. They often need to engage in finding building materials and parts, which takes up a lot of time. In addition, the engineering director is often entrusted with preparing budgets and ordering materials, which should originally be done by the technical sections of each work zone. The engineering director should be freed from these duties outside his scope of responsibility.

The Fight Against Flies – Carriers of Infectious Diseases

The "Medical Worker's Newspaper" published an article on May 19th entitled "The Fight Against Flies – Carriers of Infectious Diseases." The abstract is as follows:

Flies growing in residential areas are direct carriers of intestinal infectious diseases.

Cities are carrying out large-scale and planned work to eliminate flies. Methods based on the latest achievements in parasitology prove that completely or nearly completely eliminating flies is entirely possible. This task is important. Successfully completing this task will reduce summer intestinal diseases.

Unfortunately, there are still some incorrect views among some infectious disease specialists who believe that preventing flies from laying eggs seems impossible and that all measures taken in this regard cannot achieve the goal. The emergence of this view is either due to complete ignorance of fly biology and the main methods of fighting flies or due to unwillingness to organize this struggle.

There are also medical personnel who genuinely believe that houseflies can lay eggs in forests, meadows, and fields, which is a very wrong view. In fact, flies can only reproduce on garbage containing organic matter accumulated near people's homes. The large number of flies in residential areas can explain this point.

Never forget that flies can reproduce not only in the yard but also in the house – at the bottom of uncleared garbage cans, on scraps of prepared food... Timely removal of this garbage can prevent the appearance of flies.

Collecting garbage in garbage cans and carefully cleaning these cans every day can stop the reproduction of flies. The elimination of fly breeding grounds can only be achieved with planned and ubiquitous implementation.

The fight against flies should not only be carried out in summer, it is especially important to eliminate winter flies.

In spring, residential areas must be thoroughly cleaned, and all garbage accumulated in winter must be removed. After the spring cleaning, a summer garbage removal system should be established. Sanitary and anti-epidemic stations should ensure that each garbage removal management office develops a precise schedule for garbage removal, including the dates for removing garbage from each house.

To prevent infectious diseases, in addition to public epidemic prevention measures, all methods of eliminating flies must be used.

In each residential area, a large number of houses should be disinfected, which will also greatly reduce the number of flies in neighboring undisinfected houses. The work of anti-malaria stations proves that thorough disinfection of residential areas with DDT in early spring can effectively eliminate flies throughout the summer.

The task of medical personnel is to correctly and timely organize the use of all methods to completely eliminate flies – carriers of infectious diseases. All measures must be taken to prevent flies from appearing in infectious disease hospitals and in nurseries and wards for children suffering from chronic dysentery. Preventing flies from flying into the room and eliminating flying insects can prevent flies from transmitting diseases.

Extensive health education and the cultivation of active medical workers, and the participation of all residents in the health movement, are the urgent tasks of health agencies.

专栏：苏联报刊论文摘要

    苏联报刊论文摘要
    建筑工地的工程主任
    “汽笛报”五月二十八日发表社论，指出做一个好的工程主任所应注意的问题，摘要如下：
    工程师日列兹奈·伊凡·格夫里劳维奇在西伯利亚铁路建筑托辣斯里享有“最好的工程主任”的荣誉。他所领导的全体建筑员工，一贯地超额完成任务，交出的工程质量也总是优等的。
    在运输事业的建筑工程中，有不少这样先进的工程主任。他们执行领导，同时也进行学习，扩大自己的眼界，并积极参加社会活动。工程主任就是生产技术的领导人，先进的工程师思想的传导者。他有责任把科学家、工程师、斯大哈诺夫式的建筑人员们的一切进步的倡议付诸实现。
    技术知识的经常提高，是对工程主任的首先要求。特别是当现在建筑工地中已装备有从电刨、电钻、水泵，直到强有力的塔形起重机、掘凿机、铲土机、铺路机等许多机械设备的时候，这尤其显得重要。懂得机器，教导人们去使用它，培养人们对机械化的兴趣，这就是工程主任的一个最重要任务。
    工程主任也是一个广泛采用先进劳动方法的组织者。他的责任是要注意使每一件倡议都能迅速地获得全体员工的支持，使青年工人能向熟练的建筑工作者学得经验。
    在建筑事业中，同在其他生产部门一样，正确地建立基层计划，是实现高度劳动生产率的必需条件。如果那儿的工程主任帮助他的员工制定了周和昼夜的计划，使人们事先知道他们所应完成的任务是什么，那儿的人们就不会把每天上午的时间浪费在分配人力和安排工作上面，而且一定可以获得成绩。周和昼夜的工作指示图表，是组织每周工作的一种有效率的计划。工程主任在参加拟订计划时，应当运用自己的才能，善于发掘提高劳动生产率的潜力和克服困难。
    在我国，还有未受过技术教育的实地工作的工程主任。他们特别需要通过学习来充实自己的知识。
    一些工程主任在对建筑工地实行技术领导时，还要处理许多经济的和行政方面的事务。他们常常需要从事找寻建筑材料和零件的工作，在这些事情上要费去很多时间。此外，工程主任常被委托编制预算、订购材料，而这些本来是应由各工段的技术科来做的。应当使工程主任摆脱这些非自己分内的职责。
    对苍蝇——传染病的传播者的斗争
       “医务工作者报”五月十九日发表以“对苍蝇——
    传染病的传播者的斗争”为题的论文。摘要如下：
    生长在居民住宅区的苍蝇，是肠传染病的直接传播者。
    各城市正在进行大规模的有计划的消灭苍蝇的工作。以寄生虫学的最新成就为基础的办法证明：全部或接近全部地消灭苍蝇这件事是完全可以实现的。这个任务是重要的。成功地完成这个任务，夏季的肠病就会减少。
    可惜，在某些传染病学者之间还有一些不正确的见解，他们认为，预防苍蝇产卵好像是不可能的，而且在这方面所进行的一切措施是不能达到目的的。这种见解的产生或者是由于对苍蝇生物学和对苍蝇斗争的主要办法完全无知，或者是由于不愿意组织这个斗争。
    还有这样的医务人员，他们当真地认为，家蝇能够在森林、草地和田野里产卵，这种看法是十分错误的。实际上，苍蝇只能在堆积于人们住宅附近的含有有机体的垃圾上繁殖。居民住宅区有大量苍蝇可以说明这一点。
    决不要忘记，苍蝇不仅能够在院子里，而且也能在屋子里——在清除不净的垃圾箱底、在做好的食物的屑末上……繁殖。适时地清除这些垃圾，就能预防苍蝇的出现。
    把垃圾收集在垃圾箱里，每天仔细地清扫这些箱子就可以终止苍蝇的繁殖。苍蝇产卵地的消灭，只有在有计划和到处进行的情况下，才能实现。
    对苍蝇的斗争不仅应当在夏天进行，特别重要的是要消灭冬蝇。
    在春天，必须对居民住宅区进行彻底的清除，把冬天堆积起来的垃圾全部清除掉。在春季清除以后，应当建立夏季清除垃圾的制度。卫生防疫站应当做到，使各个清除垃圾的管理处制订出清除垃圾的精确进度表，和清除每所房屋的日期。
    为了预防传染病，除却公共防疫措施以外，还须使用一切消灭苍蝇的方法。
    在每个居民住宅区应当对大量的住屋加以消毒，这也会使邻近未经消毒的住屋里大量减少苍蝇。抗疟站的工作证明：在初春使用滴滴涕对居民区住宅进行彻底的消毒，实际上就可以使整个夏天苍蝇绝迹。
    医务人员的任务，就是要正确地和适时地组织使用一切办法，以达到完全消灭苍蝇——传染病的传播者。必须采用一切办法来预防苍蝇在传染病院，在为患慢性赤痢儿童而设的托儿所和病房里出现。防止苍蝇飞入住室，消灭飞虫，我们就可以预防苍蝇传染疾病。
    广泛的卫生教育和医务工作者积极分子的培养、使全体居民参加卫生运动，这就是保健机关刻不容缓的任务。
