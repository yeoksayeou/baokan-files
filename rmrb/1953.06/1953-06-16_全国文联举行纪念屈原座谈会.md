Xinhua News Agency, 15th. The All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles held a symposium on the afternoon of the 15th (the 5th day of the 5th lunar month) to commemorate the 2230th anniversary of the death of Qu Yuan, the great patriotic poet of our country.

The symposium was presided over by Zhou Yang, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles. More than 50 people from cultural and artistic circles participated in the symposium, including Zheng Zhenduo, Ding Xilin, Ouyang Yuqian, Tian Han, Lao She, Ye Shengtao, Cao Jinghua, Sun Fuyuan, Hong Shen, Feng Xuefeng, Sakov, Zhao Feng, Zhou Libo, Sha Ting, Zhao Shuli, Feng Zhi, Yuan Shuipai, Wang Yaping, Zang Kejia, Xu Chi, You Guoen, Wu Xiaobang, Liu Kaiqu, Zhou Weizhi, Zhang Geng, Ma Yanxiang, Wu Xue, Jiang Zhaohe, Gu Yuan, and Lian Kuoru.

Zhou Yang delivered the opening speech. He first explained the significance of commemorating Qu Yuan today and pointed out that the best way to commemorate him is to study his works with a realistic spirit and a scientific historical method, and to find out what in these valuable legacies is worth learning, inheriting, and developing. Then, through correct annotation, translation, and explanation, Qu Yuan's works should be brought to the people, popularized among students and intellectuals, so that Qu Yuan's legacy can be correctly accepted by the people.

Zheng Zhenduo then spoke. He said: Qu Yuan's works are realistic works, which express the most turbulent era in history. Through his own dissatisfaction and misfortune, Qu Yuan expressed the common dissatisfaction and misfortune of the people at that time. He also said: The artistry of Qu Yuan's works is very high, and this high level of artistic cultivation is the fundamental reason why his works can be preserved. Through Qu Yuan's works, we can not only understand the general situation of the era, but also understand the level reached by the entire culture and art of that era.

Feng Xuefeng focused on explaining the popular character of Qu Yuan's works in his speech. He pointed out that Qu Yuan's works reflected the people's creation in the high culture of the State of Chu at that time, and his works were based on folk songs and improved. At that time, the people opposed war and dark and corrupt politics, and Qu Yuan also resolutely opposed war and dark and corrupt politics. Qu Yuan's actions and works clearly reflected the demands of the people at that time, reflecting the irreconcilable contradiction between the people and the feudal ruling class. Therefore, Qu Yuan became a great poet with a popular character.

You Guoen then spoke. He said: Qu Yuan's works have great achievements both in terms of political standards and artistic standards, and the two are unified. He inherited and developed the excellent traditions of ancient Chinese folk literature. To commemorate Qu Yuan, we should learn from his strong and unyielding spirit of loving the motherland and the people, and at the same time learn from his correct creative experience.

    全国文联举行纪念屈原座谈会
    【新华社十五日讯】十五日（旧历五月五日）是我国伟大的爱国诗人屈原逝世二千二百三十周年纪念日。中华全国文学艺术界联合会特在十五日下午举行纪念座谈会。
    座谈会由中华全国文学艺术界联合会副主席周扬主持。参加座谈会的有文化艺术界人士郑振铎、丁西林、欧阳予倩、田汉、老舍、叶圣陶、曹靖华、孙伏园、洪深、冯雪峰、沙可夫、赵沨、周立波、沙汀、赵树理、冯至、袁水拍、王亚平、臧克家、徐迟、游国恩、吴晓邦、刘开渠、周巍峙、张庚、马彦祥、吴雪、蒋兆和、古元、连阔如等五十多人。
    周扬致开会词，他首先说明今天纪念屈原的意义，并指出纪念他的最好方法，是以实事求是的精神和科学的历史的方法研究他的作品，找出在这些宝贵遗产中那些东西是值得我们学习、继承和发展的。然后用正确的注释、翻译和解说的工作使屈原的作品到人民中去，普及到学生中和知识分子中去，使屈原的遗产能为人民所正确的接受。
    郑振铎继起讲话。他说：屈原的作品是现实主义的作品，它表现了历史上一个最动荡的时代。屈原通过自己的不满和不幸，表达了当时人民的共同不满和不幸。他又说：屈原作品的艺术性非常之高，这种高度的艺术修养是他的作品能够保存下来的根本原因。通过屈原的作品，我们不仅可以了解当时时代的一般情况，而且可以了解当时时代整个的文化艺术所达到的水平。
    冯雪峰在讲话中着重解释了屈原作品的人民性。他指出屈原的作品反映了当时楚国的高度的文化中的人民的创造，他的作品是以民歌的形式作基础加以提高的。当时人民反对战争反对黑暗腐败的政治，屈原也坚决反对战争和黑暗腐败的政治。屈原的行为和作品都明确地反映了当时人民的要求，反映了人民和封建统治阶级的无可调和的矛盾，因此屈原才成为伟大的具有人民性的诗人。
    游国恩接着讲话。他说：屈原的作品无论就政治标准和艺术标准来看都有其伟大的成就，而且两者是统一的。他继承和发扬了我国古代民间文学的优良传统。我们纪念屈原，应好好地学习他的爱祖国和爱人民的坚强不屈的精神，同时也要学习他的正确的创作经验。
