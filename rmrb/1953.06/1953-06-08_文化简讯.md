National Model Worker Hao Jianxiu Completes First Semester at Shandong University's Workers and Peasants' Rapid Course Middle School

Hao Jianxiu, a nationally renowned industrial labor model, has completed her first semester at the Workers and Peasants' Rapid Course Middle School attached to Shandong University and has begun specialized studies. Hao Jianxiu was recommended and admitted to the Workers and Peasants' Rapid Course Middle School by the Qingdao Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in December 1952. She had only attended primary school for three years. Thanks to the care and cultivation of the leadership of the Qingdao No. 6 State-owned Cotton Textile Factory, she had a cultural level close to that of a senior primary school student before entering the school. Hao Jianxiu studied very diligently after entering the Workers and Peasants' Rapid Course Middle School. In the final examinations at the end of the first semester in early April this year, her average score in all courses was above 70 points; among them, arithmetic and Chinese were both above 85 points.

Ancient Stone Pagoda Excavated in Lianjiang County, Fujian

During the construction of water conservancy projects in Lianjiang County, Fujian Province, an ancient stone pagoda was excavated under the enemy tower city wall of the South Gate in the county seat. Ancient artifacts such as copper pagodas, copper mirrors, and copper coins were found in the third, fourth, and fifth layers of the stone pagoda. The excavated stone pagoda is 7.9 meters high, and the diameter of the bottom layer is 1.72 meters. The pagoda is octagonal. There are "Chongning Tongbao" coins from the Song Dynasty and copper coins with the "Zhiyuan" era name from the Yuan Dynasty inside the pagoda. This stone pagoda is likely a relic from the Song and Yuan dynasties. The small copper pagoda found in the stone pagoda is 0.167 meters high and the base is 0.08 meters wide, square-shaped, and inscribed with "Respectfully made by Qian Hongchu, King of Wuyue..." and other characters. According to identification, this was made by Qian Hongchu, King of Wuyue during the Five Dynasties period, and can be used for research on the architectural history of the Five Dynasties.
