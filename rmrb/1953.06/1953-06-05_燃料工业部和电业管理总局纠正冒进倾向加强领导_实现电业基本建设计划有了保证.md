    The Central Ministry of Fuel Industry and its subordinate General Administration of Electric Power recently corrected the blind adventurist tendencies in this year's basic electric power construction, reduced some of the unachievable workload, and at the same time, took swift and effective measures to solve many problems in key projects that must be completed, and strengthened inspection and supervision of its subordinate units, creating the necessary conditions for completing this year's plan.
    This year, the task of basic electric power construction is very heavy, more than twice the workload of last year. When drafting this year's plan, the leadership of the Ministry and the General Administration, lacking experience in large-scale construction, did not fully recognize the complexity of basic construction, and at the same time, did not conduct thorough and necessary investigation and research beforehand, including some impossible projects in this year's plan, showing a blind pursuit of speed. Most of these projects lacked complete original and technical data, and the necessary preparatory work before design was insufficient. Of the fifteen projects designed by the Design Bureau of the General Administration of Electric Power in March, thirteen had no project task book. Some new factories lacked topographic surveys, economic investigations, and geological drilling data for the factory site, making the design work blind, which not only wasted design resources but also delayed the construction period. The reconstruction project of the Beijing-Tianjin-Tangshan power grid is a clear example. This is a transmission line project about 270 kilometers long, with six substations. The project is large in scale. It was originally planned to start construction in the second quarter. The design of the single-line diagram started as early as April 1952. At the beginning of the design, there was no project task book or overall design. Problems such as the development of the power grid system, the location of some substations and power plants, and the improvement of the entire system's relay protection system were not decided. Such blind design encountered many difficulties. The layout of the entire system was revised several times. By mid-March, the preliminary design was nearly completed, but because the above-mentioned many fundamental problems were not resolved, it had to be stopped and the forces were concentrated to carry out surveying and investigation work. After the data was complete, the project task book and overall design were made. Eight months of working time and nearly three thousand workdays of designers were almost entirely wasted. Such a situation in which conditions were not met and included in this year's plan for blind design was not an isolated case. At the same time, judging from the design forces that have been organized, it is still difficult to fully complete the planned tasks to ensure the needs of construction. Therefore, judging from the design situation in March, only more than 80% of the planned tasks could be completed.
    The Ministry of Fuel Industry and the General Administration of Electric Power accepted these lessons and conducted a serious review and inspection of the plan. After careful consideration, those projects that were necessary but could not complete the scheduled workload this year were postponed, and at the same time, actively sought ways to solve the problems of these projects. The reconstruction project of the above-mentioned transmission line has been reduced and postponed to next year. The expansion project of the Tianjin Power Plant, which was originally scheduled to be completed this year, was also hastily designed without a project task book, resulting in rework and waste. Now it has been decided to postpone this project to next year. There are also some newly built power plants designed by foreign countries. When compiling the plan, the coordination between the arrival date of the design drawings and the construction progress was not carefully considered, so the plan was not realistic. The Ministry of Fuel Industry and the General Administration of Electric Power have also taken the initiative to reduce the workload of these projects. After the adventurist part was reduced, the plan became more realistic.
    While reducing the plan, the Ministry and the General Administration provided swift and effective assistance to this year's key projects. This year, the electric power system has a huge transmission line project. The state's requirements for this project are urgent, and there are many difficulties in the project. This is the first large-scale transmission line project designed by our designers, and there are many problems that cannot be solved. There are also many problems in the preparation of materials. Liu Lanbo, Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Fuel Industry, and the Deputy Director of the General Administration of Electric Power personally went to the design unit, and invited more than a dozen Soviet experts from the Ministry and other relevant units to help the design unit solve the problems. The Director of the General Administration of Electric Power personally helped solve the material problems. With the strong help of the leadership, the necessary conditions were finally created for the completion of this project. For example, the preparation work of the Central South Electric Power System was originally slow, the site management of the projects under construction was chaotic, the organizational structure was unsound, and there was a universal phenomenon of no one being responsible. In order to break through this weak link, the Director of the Basic Construction Department of the General Administration of Electric Power led an inspection team to conduct an in-depth inspection of the Central South Electric Power System. Now the leadership of the Central South has begun to strengthen, and various management systems have begun to be established. The serious chaos and waste phenomenon on the Zhengzhou construction site has begun to change. The construction force of the Xi'an and Dihua electric power systems is insufficient. The Ministry and the General Administration have timely allocated the construction force and directly assisted in solving the shortage of construction, installation machinery and materials.
    The Ministry of Fuel Industry and the General Administration of Electric Power have also balanced the construction force nationwide. In addition to adjustments within major administrative regions, they have also drawn installation forces from the Northeast and North China to support Xi'an, Chongqing, Dihua, and Zhengzhou. After these efforts, the design, materials, equipment, and construction forces have been largely balanced.
    At present, the problems that need to be further solved in the preparation work for basic electric power construction are: First, from the leadership to the construction units, it is necessary to continue to deepen the understanding of the situation and balance various forces more specifically and meticulously. There are still problems in some projects where the design drawing submission date, the arrival date of materials and equipment at the construction site, and the construction progress are not coordinated. All units should actively find ways to solve these problems (the construction force also needs to be further balanced, for example, the Central South Region lacks installation technicians, while other regions have idle workers). Second, the phenomenon of no one being responsible in construction management and preparation work must be greatly overcome. Because of chaotic management, the responsibility system has not been established or is unsound. Many of the projects that have already started construction are of poor quality, cannot be completed on time, and the waste is quite serious. The progress of preparation work is also slow. The first quarter only completed 39.2% of the original plan (the plan being too high is also a reason). The Ministry and the General Administration have decided to launch a struggle against the phenomenon of no one being responsible and to establish a responsibility system in the second quarter.

    燃料工业部和电业管理总局纠正冒进倾向加强领导
    实现电业基本建设计划有了保证
    中央燃料工业部和所属电业管理总局，最近纠正了今年电业基本建设中的盲目冒进倾向，削减了一些不能完成的工作量，同时，采取迅速有效的措施解决了必须完成的重点工程中的许多问题，加强对所属各单位的检查督促，为完成今年计划创造了必需的条件。
    今年，电业基本建设的任务很大，相当去年工作量的两倍多。在编制今年的计划时，部和总局的领导方面因为缺少进行大规模建设的经验，对于基本建设的复杂性认识不足，同时事先没有进行周密的必要的调查研究，把一些没有可能完成的工程项目列入今年的计划，表现出盲目求快的情绪。这些工程中大都原始资料和技术资料不够齐全，设计前必须的准备工作作得很不够。电业总局设计局三月份中进行设计的十五项工程中十三项没有计划任务书，有的新厂厂址地形测量、经济调查、地质钻探等资料都不够，使设计工作盲目进行，不但浪费设计力量，而且延误工期。京、津、唐电力网的改建工程就是显明的例证。这是一个长约二百七十公里的输电线路工程，中有六个变电所，工程规模很大，原计划第二季开始施工，这个工程早在一九五二年四月即开始设计单线图。开始设计时，计划任务书和总体设计都没有，电力网系统的发展问题，有些变电所和电厂的厂址问题，整个系统的继电保护系统的改善等原则问题都没有决定。这样盲目设计遇到的困难很多，整个系统的布置几经修正，到三月中旬，初步设计已近完成，但因为上述许多原则问题没有解决，只好被迫停止设计，重新集中力量进行勘察调查工作，待资料齐全后，再做计划任务书和总体设计，八个月的工作时间，设计人员的三千个工作日几乎全部浪费。像这样条件尚不具备而列入今年计划盲目动手设计的情况并不是个别的。同时，根据已经组织起来的设计力量看，全部完成计划任务保证施工需要也还有困难。所以，在三月份，就设计情况看，只能完成计划任务的百分之八十多。
    燃料工业部和电业管理总局接受了这些教训，对于计划进行了认真的审核和检查。经过慎重考虑，把那些虽然必要，但是今年没有条件完成预定的工作量的工程，分别予以延期，同时积极设法解决这些工程的问题。上述送电线路的改建工程已被削减，推迟到明年再作。原定今年完工的天津电厂扩建工程，也是没有计划任务书就草率进行设计，结果造成返工浪费，现在这个工程也决定推迟到明年完工。还有一些国外设计的新建电厂，在编制计划时对设计图纸到达日期和施工进度的配合没有周密考虑，以致计划不切实际。燃料工业部和电业管理总局也都主动地减少了这些工程的工作量。冒进部分被削减后，计划就比较切合实际了。
    与削减计划同时，部和总局对于今年的重点工程采取迅速有效的方法给予了帮助。今年电业系统有一个规模巨大的送电线路工程，国家对这个工程的要求急，工程中的困难很多，这是我们的设计人员第一次设计的大规模送电线路工程，其中有许多问题不能解决，在器材准备方面问题也很多。燃料工业部刘澜波副部长和电业总局副局长亲到设计单位，并且邀请了部里和其他有关单位的十几位苏联专家共同帮助设计单位解决问题。电业总局局长亲自动手帮助解决器材问题。在领导方面的大力帮助下，终于为完成这个工程创造了必要的条件。又如中南电业系统原来准备工作进度迟缓，已经施工的工程工地管理混乱，组织机构不健全，普遍存在无人负责现象。为了突破这一薄弱环节，电业总局派基本建设处处长带领一个检查组，深入地对中南电业系统进行了检查。现在中南的领导力量已开始加强，各种管理制度开始建立。郑州工地严重的混乱浪费现象已经开始转变。西安、迪化电业系统的施工力量不足，部和总局已经及时地调配了施工力量，并直接协助解决营造、安装机械和器材不足的问题。
    燃料工业部和电业总局还在全国范围内平衡了施工力量，除在各大行政区之内进行调整外，并抽调东北、华北的安装力量支援西安、重庆、迪化、郑州。经过这些努力以后，设计、材料、设备和施工力量已大体做到平衡。
    目前，电业基本建设准备工作需要继续解决的问题是：一、从领导到各施工单位还须要继续深入了解情况，更具体细致地平衡各种力量。现在部分工程中还存在着设计交图日期、材料设备到达工地日期和施工进度衔接不上的问题，各单位应该积极设法解决这些问题（施工力量也还需要继续平衡，比如中南区缺少安装技工，其他区域则有窝工现象）。二、施工管理和准备工作中的无人负责现象极须大力克服。因为管理混乱，责任制没有建立或不健全，已经开工的工程很多质量低劣，不能按时完成进度，浪费现象相当严重，准备工作进度也较迟缓。第一季度只完成原订计划的百分之三十九点二（计划偏高也是一个原因）。部和总局已决定在第二季度中展开反对无人负责现象和建立责任制的斗争。
