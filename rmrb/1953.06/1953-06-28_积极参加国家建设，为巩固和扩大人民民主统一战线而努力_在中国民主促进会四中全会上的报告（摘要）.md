Actively Participate in National Construction and Strive to Consolidate and Expand the People's Democratic United Front
—Report at the Fourth Plenary Session of the China Association for Promoting Democracy (Abstract)
China Association for Promoting Democracy Chairman Ma Xulun

I. The Current Situation and Our New Tasks

From the Third Plenary Session of the Third Central Council of our association to now, in less than two years, the domestic and international situation has undergone significant changes. The Chinese people have continued to win brilliant victories on all fronts. Our country has made unprecedented and enormous progress in politics, economy, culture, and social life. At present, we are confidently carrying out the construction of the country's first Five-Year Plan. Such splendid and unprecedented achievements are only possible under the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao.

Not long ago, we all studied the speeches and reports of Comrade Stalin and Comrade Malenkov at the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and Premier Zhou Enlai's political report at the Fourth Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. In these speeches and reports, they made outstanding Marxist-Leninist analyses of the current international situation, which made us more clearly realize that the balance of power between the world peace, democracy, and socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and the imperialist aggressive camp headed by the United States has undergone great changes and is undergoing further changes; that is, the peace, democracy, and socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union has been unprecedentedly consolidated and strengthened, while the imperialist aggressive camp headed by the United States is becoming increasingly weakened.

The consistent and unwavering peace policy of the Soviet Union, China, and all People's Democratic countries has won the support of more and more people around the world. Because our peace policy fully conforms to the interests of the vast majority of people in the world. The movement against aggression and for peace, which has been widely launched among various classes and social strata in countries around the world, has become an unprecedentedly powerful force.

The recent statement by the leaders of the Soviet government on the Soviet Union's willingness to resolve international disputes or outstanding international issues on the basis of mutual agreement among the countries concerned has aroused warm welcome around the world. The Soviet statement, coupled with the statements by Premier Zhou of our country and Premier Kim Il-sung of Korea on the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue, has strengthened the confidence of people of all countries in the possibility of easing international tensions.

All of this fully proves that the development of the current situation is increasingly favorable to us and unfavorable to the enemy. In this situation, we can better accomplish the three major tasks of this year. The three major tasks for 1953 decided by the Fourth Session of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference are: (1) Continue to strengthen the struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea; (2) Begin the first Five-Year Plan for national construction; (3) Convene national and local people's congresses at all levels through universal suffrage and formulate a constitution. This is also the current political task of our association. The main purpose of our Third Plenary Session of the Fourth Central Committee is to unify our thinking and understanding based on the requirements of the three major tasks, clarify the future work guidelines, and strive to carry out the three major tasks.

The responsibility of our China Association for Promoting Democracy in continuing to strengthen the struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea is to further mobilize all members and the masses we are connected with, together with the people of the whole country, to support the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army, actively participate in the movement to defend peace, and conduct in-depth patriotic and internationalist education among our members and the masses we are connected with, draw a clear line between the enemy and ourselves, further enhance political vigilance and political responsibility, consolidate the rear of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, and firmly believe in our victory, in order to win the final victory in resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea.

Every member of our China Association for Promoting Democracy must work doubly hard together with the people of the whole country, give full play to the greatest enthusiasm and creativity in our respective work posts, strictly abide by national discipline, and ensure the completion of every specific task and specific plan of national construction. The vast majority of our members are cultural and educational workers and government employees. We must respond to Chairman Mao's call, sincerely learn from the Soviet Union, study the theories of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, and learn from the Soviet Union's advanced scientific experience and technology. With a high sense of responsibility to the country, we must strive to improve our work and ensure the realization of the national cultural and educational plan. At the same time, in each of our work posts, we must practice strict economy, oppose waste, strictly abide by national discipline, actively participate in the struggle against bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of law and discipline, and strictly prevent bad elements from slowing down work and sabotage.

The implementation of universal suffrage and the convening of the National People's Congress and local people's congresses at all levels is a great event in the political life of our people. Now the national universal suffrage movement is about to begin, and our China Association for Promoting Democracy must, together with all democratic parties, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, mobilize the masses to actively participate in this great movement. We must conduct extensive propaganda to our members and the masses we are connected with, conduct in-depth study of various policies and laws related to the People's Congress, criticize those erroneous ideas that view this election with the eyes of bourgeois democracy, and deepen their understanding of the people's democratic power. We must educate and mobilize the masses we are connected with well, highly give play to the spirit of being the masters of the country, and seriously and earnestly participate in this unprecedented democratic movement in Chinese history.

This universal suffrage is a major test for us among the people. The eyes of the people are discerning, and there is only one standard for judging good or bad, that is, the degree and effect of our efforts to serve the people. This universal suffrage is actually the most extensive mass criticism from the bottom up. Through this movement, each of us should be educated so that we can further correct our attitude of serving the people and correct the erroneous work style that is not welcomed by the people.

II. Overview of Association Affairs in the Past Two Years

Comrades! In the past two years, the work of the China Association for Promoting Democracy has mainly been carried out in conjunction with various people's political struggles and social reform movements. Certain achievements have been made in promoting members and the masses we are connected with to actively implement national policies and laws, participate in various political movements, conduct self-education, and develop and consolidate the organization.

Through the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea and defend peace, patriotic and internationalist education has been conducted among members and the masses we are connected with. Pro-American, worship-American, and fear-American ideas have been basically eliminated within our organization. The aggressive nature of imperialism has been recognized. The ideological poisoning contaminated by imperialism has begun to be cleansed. The strength of the peace, democracy, and socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union has been recognized. The practical actions of members and the masses we are connected with to do their job well have been promoted to put them into the struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea.

In the land reform and the suppression of counter-revolutionaries movement, our members, through learning and participating in actual struggles, further recognized the crimes of feudalism and the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, strengthened their revolutionary stance, basically drew a line between the enemy and ourselves, and improved their political awareness.

In the honest and truthful learning movement, most of the members were tested by the revolution.

More than 90% of our members participated in the great "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements. Through the actual exercise of the movement, they recognized the harm of the "three evils" and "five poisons" to the country, distinguished right from wrong, and further clarified the idea of being led by the working class.

In the ideological remolding learning movement, most of our cultural and educational worker members criticized the ideological influence of the bourgeoisie, and individualistic ideas such as being above class and above politics, and further recognized the correctness, profoundness, and greatness of Mao Zedong Thought. Further demands were made to liberate ourselves from the shackles of bourgeois thought, strive to arm ourselves with Marxism-Leninism, and conduct thorough transformation in order to better serve the people.

In democratic construction and in the movement to implement the Marriage Law, our organization also played a certain role.

During the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month" in 1952, the headquarters and various branches organized members and the masses we are connected with to participate in various Sino-Soviet friendship activities. The branches also conducted propaganda and education work related to learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union to members and the masses we are connected with in various ways according to their different situations.

Under the unified leadership of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, we promoted organizations at all levels to lead members to launch the study of the Common Program, as well as the study of Comrade Malenkov's report at the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and the documents mourning the death of Comrade Stalin. Through these studies, our political understanding has been improved to varying degrees.

Our organizations at all levels have also conducted basic education on the united front policy and the history, nature, and tasks of the association to members in various ways, strengthening members' ideological understanding of the united front work and enhancing members' political responsibility.

Recently, local organizations such as Beijing, Shanghai, and Tianjin have organized a number of report meetings introducing the advanced experience of learning from the Soviet Union and improving teaching work, aimed at the needs of members and the masses they are connected with. They have also conducted understanding of the ideological situation of primary and secondary school teachers in learning from the advanced teaching experience of the Soviet Union and carrying out teaching reforms through seminars and grassroots organization reports, playing some role in promoting the national cultural and educational policies and eliminating ideological obstacles.

In August 1952, we held the first national organization and propaganda work report conference. This conference summarized the experience of organization and propaganda work since the Third Plenary Session of the Third Central Committee, and further clarified the nature, tasks, and organization and propaganda work guidelines of the association.

In the past two years, due to the series of work mentioned above, we have closely linked with the masses in our work and expanded the influence of the association. Through the actual contact of various political movements, the political consciousness of petty-bourgeois intellectuals has been generally improved. There are requirements to participate in political organizations in order to further conduct self-education and self-transformation. At the same time, due to the correct leadership and vigorous help of the Chinese Communist Party, the organization of our association has developed relatively rapidly and has been consolidated to a certain extent.

The achievements mentioned above should be attributed to the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the active efforts of all our comrades.

However, it should be admitted that the development of the work of our association is uneven in various places. Our work also has shortcomings, especially in our leadership work, there are still many shortcomings. We should point out these shortcomings in a realistic manner with the spirit of criticism and self-criticism, and correct these shortcomings, so that we can better undertake our tasks.

III. Improve Work, Strengthen Organization, and Strive to Complete New Tasks!

Continuing to strengthen the struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, implement the first Five-Year Plan for national construction, and convene national and local people's congresses at all levels are the main tasks of the people of the whole country at present, and also the current political tasks of our association.

Our country has entered a new period of planned large-scale construction. This is a major event unprecedented in the history of our country. As a component of the Chinese People's Democratic United Front, in addition to continuing to participate in various people's political activities, our association should mobilize our members and the masses we are connected with to actively participate in national construction work. This is also our most central political task.

Chairman Mao told us: "Ideological remolding, especially the ideological remolding of various intellectuals, is one of the important conditions for our country to thoroughly realize democratic reform in all aspects and gradually implement industrialization." Our association is a new democratic political party with the nature of a united front that unites, educates, and transforms petty-bourgeois intellectuals. According to the nature and tasks of the association and the requirements of participating in national construction, the main work of our association is to educate members and the masses we are connected with to understand the relationship between their work and national construction. Require each member to enhance political responsibility, resolutely obey the needs of national construction, do their job well, and conduct self-education and self-transformation from practical work. In the cause of national construction, educating members and the masses we are connected with, through work practice, and constantly improving political understanding in the process of doing a good job in business and improving teaching, will be the most practical and effective way to further conduct self-transformation.

The national cultural and educational construction is closely combined with economic construction and serves economic construction. Eighty-two point five percent of our members are engaged in cultural and educational work, most of whom are primary and secondary school teachers. Therefore, in participating in national construction work, we mainly participate in national cultural and educational construction work, and among them, the work of primary and secondary schools is the focus. That is to say: For the needs of national construction, we must actively play an organizational role to unite cultural and educational workers, mainly primary and secondary school teachers, intensify learning, intensify self-transformation, and actively implement national cultural and educational policies with a spirit of responsibility to the country and the people, do a good job in business, improve the quality of teaching, and lay a good foundation for the country to train qualified construction talents. This is the central link of our future work, and all our work should revolve around this central link. If the work we do can truly play a role in this area, then it will be a contribution to national construction.

Participating in planned national construction work is a new task, a very detailed and specific task. We are still very lacking in experience in this regard, but there is a basic principle that should be affirmed, that is, to face practical work and face grassroots organizations.

Work such as conducting ideological education for members, contacting the masses, and implementing political tasks must start from grassroots organizations. In the great cause of national construction, in order to enable the organization of the association to play a better role in promoting members to do their job well and complete national tasks, we must face the grassroots and vigorously strengthen grassroots organizations. In order to facilitate the combination of members' business and conduct ideological education in a specific and practical way, grassroots organizations should be established as much as possible according to work units.

Past experience has proven that in a unit, the grassroots organization must, under the leadership of the Communist Party, closely combine with the central work of the unit. The work of the grassroots organization of the association should conform to the policy and plan requirements of the unit's administration, and also pay close attention to the connection and mutual cooperation with the trade union, the Youth League, and other friendly party organizations.

Regarding the organizational work policy issue, organizational work should be subordinate to the requirements of the nature and tasks of the association, and subordinate to the central political tasks of our association in a certain period. In the future, organizational work should resolutely implement the policy of combining consolidation and development. We must focus on work, focus on education, enrich the content of organizational life, and closely combine the consolidation and development of the organization. In areas or units where development has been rapid in the past, the number of developments has been large, and grassroots organizations are not sound, grassroots organization work should be strengthened and efforts should be made to consolidate. In areas or units where grassroots organizations are relatively sound and have sufficient development conditions, appropriate development should be carried out through work, while paying attention to consolidation. On the basis of progressive backbones, we should focus on absorbing the intermediate and backward ones; in grassroots organizations that do not have or lack progressive backbones, we should promptly enhance progressive backbones.

Regarding development targets, judging from the work and organizational development in the past two years, it is appropriate to focus on petty-bourgeois intellectuals, including educators, cultural and publishing workers, medical and health workers, scientific workers, government employees, etc., and mainly focus on primary and secondary school teachers and cultural and publishing workers. At the same time, appropriate attention should also be paid to absorbing faculty and staff of universities and colleges. In the above-mentioned various professional circles, we should focus on uniting, striving for, and absorbing influential and representative people. We have already proposed this policy at the National Organization and Propaganda Work Report Conference, but in actual work, we have not understood it clearly enough, and therefore it has not been implemented enough. Attention should be paid to it in the future.

In a number of large and medium-sized cities that have the conditions to establish local organizations, we should first strive to get some influential people from the cultural and educational circles who can serve as leading backbones to join the association, and prepare new local organizations in a step-by-step manner.

We must do the above work well to complete our tasks. We must strengthen political and ideological leadership and improve working methods.

Comrades! Our association, as a component of the Chinese People's Democratic United Front, and as an assistant to the Chinese Communist Party, is facing such a solemn and great cause of national construction. Our responsibility is great and our task is glorious. We must unite more closely and contribute all our strength, actively participate in national construction, and strive to consolidate and expand the People's Democratic United Front. The glorious and victorious banner of Mao Zedong will always guide us forward! (Xinhua News Agency)

    积极参加国家建设，为巩固和扩大人民民主统一战线而努力
    ——在中国民主促进会四中全会上的报告（摘要）
    中国民主促进会主席　马叙伦
    一、目前形势和我们的新任务
    从我会第三届中央理事会第三次全体会议到现在，不到两年的时间，国内国际的形势已经起了重大的变化。我们中国人民在各个战线上都继续赢得了辉煌的胜利。我们国家在政治、经济、文化、社会生活各方面都有了空前的巨大的进步。目前我们正满怀信心地进行国家第一个五年计划建设。这样灿烂的史无前例的成就，只有在中国共产党和毛主席的正确领导下才有可能。
    不久以前，我们大家都学习了斯大林同志和马林科夫同志在苏联共产党第十九次代表大会上的演说和报告，和周恩来总理在中国人民政治协商会议第一届全国委员会第四次会议上的政治报告。在这些演说和报告中，他们对于当前的国际形势作了卓越的马克思、列宁主义的分析，使我们更加清楚地认识到以苏联为首的世界和平、民主与社会主义阵营与以美国为首的帝国主义侵略阵营力量的对比已经有了很大的变化，并且正在发生着进一步的变化；那就是，以苏联为首的和平、民主与社会主义阵营是空前地巩固与强大了，而以美国为首的帝国主义侵略阵营是越来越削弱了。
    苏联、中国和所有人民民主国家的一贯的坚持不渝的和平政策，已获得了全世界越来越多的人民的拥护。因为我们的和平政策，完全符合于全世界最大多数人民的利益。在全世界各国各种不同的阶级和社会阶层中广泛展开的反对侵略，争取和平的运动，已经成为空前强大的力量。
    苏联政府领袖不久以前发表的关于苏联愿意在有关各国相互协议的基础上，解决国际争端或悬而未决的国际问题的声明，引起了全世界热烈的欢迎。苏联的声明，加上我国周总理和朝鲜金日成首相关于和平解决朝鲜问题的声明，使各国人民对于缓和国际紧张局势的可能，加强了信心。
    所有这一切都充分证明了目前形势的发展日益有利于我们、不利于敌人。在这一形势下，我们就能更好地来完成今年的三大任务。中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会第四次会议所决定一九五三年的三大任务为：（一）继续加强抗美援朝斗争；（二）开始国家建设的第一个五年计划；（三）召开普选制的全国及地方各级人民代表大会，制定宪法。这也就是我会当前的政治任务。我们这次召开三届四中全会的主要目的，就是要根据三大任务的要求，统一我们的思想认识，明确今后的工作方针，为执行三大任务而奋斗。
    我们中国民主促进会在继续加强抗美援朝斗争中的责任，就是要进一步动员全体会员和我们所联系的群众和全国人民一道，支援中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军，积极参加保卫和平运动，并在我们会员和所联系的群众中进行深入的爱国主义与国际主义的教育，划清敌我界限，进一步提高政治警惕性和政治责任感，巩固抗美援朝的后方，坚定我们胜利的信心，以争取抗美援朝最后的胜利。
    我们中国民主促进会每一个会员必须和全国人民一道加倍努力，在我们的每一个人的工作岗位上发挥最大的积极性和创造性，严格遵守国家纪律，保证国家建设的每一具体任务和具体计划的完成。我们绝大多数的会员是文化教育工作者和机关工作者，我们必须响应毛主席的号召，诚心诚意地向苏联学习，学习马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林理论，学习苏联先进的科学经验和技术。以对国家高度负责的精神，努力提高工作，保证国家文教计划的实现。同时，在我们每一个工作岗位中，必须厉行节约，反对浪费，严格遵守国家纪律，积极参加反对官僚主义，命令主义和违法乱纪的斗争，严防坏分子怠工和破坏。
    实行普选，召开全国人民代表大会和地方各级人民代表大会，是我们全国人民政治生活中的一个伟大事件。现在全国的普选运动即将开始，我们中国民主促进会必须和各民主党派一道，在中国共产党领导之下，动员群众积极参加这一伟大运动。我们要对会员和所联系的群众进行广泛的宣传，深入地进行有关人民代表大会各项政策法令的学习和批判那些用资产阶级民主的眼光来看待这次选举的错误思想，加深他们对于人民民主政权的认识，必须很好地教育和动员我们所联系的群众，高度发挥国家主人翁的精神，严肃认真地来参加这一中国历史上空前的民主运动。
    这次普选，对于我们来说，是在人民群众中一个重大的考验，人民的眼睛是雪亮的，好坏标准的尺度只有一个，就是为人民服务的努力程度和效果如何。这次普选，实际上也是一个最广泛的群众性的自下而上的批评，通过这一运动，我们每个人都应该受到教育，使我们进一步端正为人民服务的态度，改正为人民所不欢迎的错误作风。
    二、两年来的会务概况
    同志们！两年来，中国民主促进会的工作主要是结合着各项人民政治斗争和社会改革运动进行的，在推动会员和所联系的群众，积极执行国家的政策、法令方面，和参加各项政治运动，进行自我教育方面，以及发展和巩固组织方面，都取得了一定的成绩。
    通过抗美援朝保卫和平运动，对会员和所联系的群众进行了爱国主义与国际主义教育，在我们组织内基本上肃清了亲美、崇美、恐美思想，认清了帝国主义的侵略本质，开始清洗了从帝国主义所沾染的思想毒害，认识了以苏联为首的和平、民主与社会主义阵营力量的强大，推动了会员和所联系的群众以积极做好岗位工作的实际行动投入抗美援朝斗争。
    在土地改革、镇压反革命运动中，我们的会员通过学习和参加实际斗争，进一步认识了封建主义和国民党反动统治的罪恶，坚定了革命立场，基本上划清了敌我界限，提高了政治觉悟。
    在忠诚老实学习运动中，大部分的会员受到了革命的考验。
    我们的会员百分之九十以上都参加了伟大的“三反”、“五反”运动，通过运动的实际锻炼，认识了“三害”、“五毒”对国家的危害性，辨别了是非，进一步明确了以工人阶级为领导的思想。
    在思想改造学习运动中，我们大部分的文化教育工作者的会员批判了资产阶级的思想影响，和超阶级、超政治等的个人主义思想，进一步认识了毛泽东思想的正确、深刻、伟大。进一步要求把自己从资产阶级思想的束缚中解放出来，努力以马克思、列宁主义武装起来，进行彻底改造，以便更好地为人民服务。
    在民主建政，在贯彻婚姻法运动中，我们的组织也发挥了一定的作用。
    在一九五二年“中苏友好月”中，总部及各分会都组织会员和所联系的群众参加各项中苏友好活动，各分会并根据其不同情况通过各种方式向会员和所联系的群众进行了有关学习苏联先进经验的宣传教育工作。
    在中国人民政协全国委员会的统一领导下，我们推动了各级组织带动会员展开了对共同纲领的学习，以及对马林科夫同志在苏联共产党第十九次代表大会上的报告、悼念斯大林同志逝世的文件的学习，通过这些学习，我们的政治认识都有了不同程度的提高。
    我们各级组织并通过各种方式，对会员进行了统一战线政策和会的历史、性质、任务的基础教育，加强了会员对统一战线工作的思想认识，提高了会员的政治责任感。
    最近期间，北京、上海、天津等地方组织针对着会员和所联系的群众的需要，组织了一些有关介绍学习苏联先进经验和改进教学工作的报告会，并通过座谈会、基层组织汇报等方式，进行了解中小学教师在学习苏联先进教学经验，进行教学改革中的思想情况，为推行国家文教政策，扫除思想障碍，发挥了一些作用。
    一九五二年八月，我们召开了第一次全国组织宣教工作汇报会议，这次会议总结了三中全会以来组织、宣教工作的经验，进一步明确了会的性质、任务和组织、宣教工作的方针。
    两年来，由于我们进行了上述一系列的工作，在工作中密切了和群众的联系，扩大了会的影响；经过各项政治运动的实际接触，小资产阶级知识分子的政治觉悟有了普遍的提高，有参加政治组织的要求，以便进一步进行自我教育和自我改造。同时，由于中国共产党的正确领导和大力帮助，我们会的组织较迅速地得到了发展，与一定程度的巩固。
    以上这些成绩的获得，应该归功于中国共产党的正确领导和我们全体同志的积极努力。
    但是，应该承认我们会的工作在各地的发展情况是不平衡的。我们的工作也还是有缺点的，特别在我们的领导工作中还存在着不少的缺点。我们应当实事求是地以批评与自我批评的精神来指出这些缺点，纠正这些缺点，这样，才能更好地来担当我们的任务。
    三、提高工作，加强组织，为完成新任务而奋斗！
    继续加强抗美援朝斗争，执行国家建设的第一个五年计划，召开全国及地方各级人民代表大会，是全国人民当前的主要任务，也就是我们会当前的政治任务。
    我们的国家已经进入有计划的大规模建设的新时期了，这是我国历史上从来未有的大事。作为中国人民民主统一战线的一个组成部分，我们会除了继续参加各项人民政治活动以外，应该动员我们会员和所联系的群众，积极参加国家建设工作，这也就是我们最中心的政治任务。
    毛主席告诉我们：“思想改造，首先是各种知识分子的思想改造，是我国在各方面彻底实现民主改革和逐步实行工业化的重要条件之一。”我们会是一个以团结、教育、改造小资产阶级知识分子为主的统一战线性质的新民主主义政治党派。依据会的性质任务和参加国家建设的要求来说，我们会的主要工作就是要教育会员和所联系的群众认识自己所担负的工作与国家建设的关系。要求每一会员提高政治责任感，坚决服从国家建设的需要，作好各自的岗位工作，从实际工作中来进行自我教育，自我改造。在国家建设事业中，教育会员和所联系的群众，通过工作实践，在搞好业务，改进教学的过程中不断提高政治认识，将是进一步进行自我改造的最切实有效的方法。
    国家的文教建设是与经济建设密切结合，并为经济建设服务的。我们会有百分之八二·五的会员是从事于文化教育工作的，其中大部分的会员是中小学教职员。因此，我们在参加国家建设工作中，主要是参加国家文教建设工作，而其中以中小学的工作为重点。这就是说：为着国家建设的需要，我们必须通过切实具体的工作，积极发挥组织作用去团结文教工作者，主要是中小学教职员，加紧学习，加紧自我改造，积极地、以对国家人民负责的精神来执行国家文教政策，搞好业务，提高教学质量，为国家培养合格的建设人材打下良好的基础，这是我们今后工作的中心环节，我们的一切工作应环绕着这一中心环节。如果我们所做的工作真正能在这一方面发挥作用，那么对国家建设就是有了贡献。
    参加有计划的国家建设工作，是一项新的工作，是非常细致和具体的工作，在这方面我们还十分缺乏经验，但是有一条基本原则是应该肯定的，那就是要面向实际工作，面向基层组织。
    对会员进行思想教育，联系群众，贯彻政治任务等工作，必须从基层组织做起。在伟大的国家建设事业中，要使会的组织在推动会员做好岗位工作，完成国家任务中发挥更好的作用，我们就不能不面向基层，大力加强基层组织，为着便于结合会员的业务，具体切实地进行思想教育，基层组织应尽可能按照工作单位来建立。
    过去的经验证明，在一个单位中，基层组织必须在共产党的领导下，密切结合本单位的中心工作，会的基层组织的工作，应符合于本单位行政的方针与计划的要求，同时也要密切注意与工会、青年团、其他友党组织等的联系及相互配合。
    关于组织工作的方针问题，组织工作应当服从于会的性质任务的要求，服从于我们会一定时期内的中心的政治任务。今后的组织工作，应坚决贯彻巩固与发展相结合的方针。要着重工作，着重教育，充实组织生活内容，使组织的巩固与发展密切相结合。过去发展较快，发展数量较多，基层组织不健全的地区或单位，应加强基层组织工作，力求巩固。在基层组织较健全，有足够发展条件的地区或单位中应通过工作适当发展，同时注意巩固。在有进步骨干的基础上，应着重吸收中间和后进的；在没有或缺少进步骨干的基层组织中，应及时增强进步骨干。
    关于发展对象，根据两年来的工作和组织发展情况来看，以小资产阶级知识分子为主、包括教育工作者、文化出版工作者、医药卫生工作者、科学工作者、机关工作者等，而以中小学教职员、文化出版工作者为主要发展对象是合适的。同时亦应适当地注意吸收高等学校的教职员。在上述各种职业界中均应着重团结、争取、吸收较有社会影响的有代表性的人士，这一方针在全国组织宣教工作汇报会议的时候我们已经提出了的，但是在实际工作中，我们体会得还不够明确，因而也贯彻得不够，今后应予以注意。
    在若干具有建立地方组织的条件的大中城市中，应首先争取一些可以作领导骨干的文教界有影响的人士入会，有步骤地筹备新的地方组织。
    我们要很好地进行上述工作，来完成我们的任务，就必须加强政治思想领导，改进工作方法。
    同志们！我们会作为中国人民民主统一战线的一个组成部分，作为中国共产党的一个助手，面对着国家建设这样庄严伟大的事业，我们的责任是重大的，任务是光荣的。我们要更加团结一致地贡献自己的一切力量，积极参加国家建设，为巩固和扩大人民民主统一战线而奋斗。光辉的、胜利的毛泽东旗帜将永远引导着我们前进！　（新华社）
