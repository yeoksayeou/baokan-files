In this year's spring plowing production, Zhongshan County, Guangdong Province, combined specific people and specific events to implement production policies, eliminating many farmers' ideological concerns and basically stabilizing the new production order. Farmers have high production enthusiasm and have begun to establish the concept of diligent production and patriotic prosperity. Cadres and the masses are confident that the county's total output this year will increase by 15% compared to last year.

Zhongshan County completed the review of land reform work last autumn and before spring plowing this year. In March of this year, it announced the end of land reform throughout the county and the transition to production. During this transition period, farmers were unsure of production policies; cadres lacked a production concept, could not see the future of rural work, were uneasy about rural work, and wanted to return to the city, return to government offices, work in industrial departments, or go to study. Therefore, they were not concerned about or involved in farmers' production; they did not understand it nor did they study it. Some people blindly believed that the main task of leading production in the future was to organize mutual aid teams, and considered that there was success if there were mutual aid teams, and no success if there were no mutual aid teams. As a result, a hasty and冒进 bias was created, which damaged the farmers' enthusiasm for production. In the implementation of free lending, many areas saw forced or disguised forced lending, and the arbitrary use of other people's cattle and farm tools without compensation. Because output was not verified, farmers were afraid that increased production would increase their burden; in the past, when cadres promoted the socialist future, they one-sidedly publicized how socialism would collectivize land and provide abundant food and clothing, without explaining to farmers how to get to socialism, inadvertently spreading the idea of "eating from the big pot." Bad people and loafers took the opportunity to incite the masses to sell their belongings in order to profit from it. Therefore, farmers' thinking was confused, and they were generally afraid of "collective ownership," afraid of "mutual aid," and afraid of increased burdens. Some even took pride in being poor and looked forward to "communism." The phenomenon of extravagant eating and drinking, selling houses, selling cattle, selling farm tools, and cutting down fruit trees, which damaged production, became widespread.

In light of the above situation, when Zhongshan County began its transition to production, it first trained county and district cadres, organized cadres to study the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China's documents on rural work and the People's Daily editorial "What is the Key to Leading Agricultural Production," criticized the idea of being uneasy about rural work, and reviewed past hasty and 冒进 tendencies in leading farmers' production. After studying, most cadres clearly realized that the key to leading rural work in the area at present lay in vigorously publicizing and implementing policies to stabilize the new relations of production. With a clear direction, they were very motivated. After going to the countryside, they first vigorously publicized and implemented production policies. In areas where the busy farming season had already begun, they mainly used small group meetings or individual contact methods for publicity; in areas where the busy farming season had not yet begun, they used farmers' representative meetings and mass meetings for publicity. The main content of the publicity was to explain the "Ten Measures on Launching the Patriotic Agricultural Increase Production Movement" promulgated by the Central South Administrative Committee. By announcing fixed output and publicizing agricultural tax policies, the masses' ideological concerns that increased production would increase their burden were basically dispelled.

Because the policies were only publicized but not specifically implemented, the masses still had many ideological concerns after the start of spring plowing; the difficulties in the production and life of poor peasants and farm laborers had not been resolved. Some cadres in some areas were only satisfied with general meeting publicity, which resulted in the masses becoming bored and dissatisfied. For example, the Eleventh District held a mass meeting that lasted until midnight without solving any specific problems, resulting in the masses gradually disbanding, leaving only a few activists. After the Zhongshan County Committee of the Communist Party of China discovered this situation, it promptly instructed all areas to focus on the current production season, lead farmers in spring plowing production, and implement policies more deeply by starting with the inspection of production and combining specific people and specific events. From then on, cadres working in various villages began to overcome their floating work style, go deep into the fields, go deep into the production process, and discover and solve problems in a timely manner. When Zhangjiabian Township was building water conservancy projects, in order to help poor peasants and farm laborers overcome difficulties in production, it called for the organization of temporary helpers; however, because the township had blindly organized mutual aid teams in the past, violating the principle of "voluntary mutual benefit," many farmers had suffered losses and mistakenly believed that organizing mutual aid teams was "large-scale collectivization," which meant not distinguishing between you and me, so they were unwilling to organize. The leading cadres of the township then convened a meeting of mutual aid team leaders to discuss and criticize the past bias of "large-scale collectivization" (no work recording, no accounting), so that everyone realized that the organization of mutual aid teams must be "voluntary mutual benefit," and realized the reasons for the collapse of the mutual aid teams organized in the past. Those who had taken advantage of others in the past mutual aid teams realized their mistakes and were prepared to make up for the wages of those who had suffered losses. As a result, the collapsed mutual aid teams were restored; the masses' ideological concerns about fearing mutual aid were eliminated.

Zhongshan County concretely implemented policies in various places around spring plowing production, and timely discovered and solved problems such as barren fields, insect pests, and lack of seedlings. For example, in Pinglan Township, many seedlings were damaged by the cold wave; township cadres promptly mobilized the masses to help each other and borrow from each other, so that more than 200 mu of fields could be replanted in time. De Shengjie, a small landowner, rented out seven mu of land last year, but not only did she not receive rent, but she also had to buy grain to pay public grain, so this year she prepared to abandon the seven mu of land; cadres persuaded the tenant farmers to pay rent according to the contract, ensuring timely cultivation. Liang Longtian, a poor peasant in Waisha Township who actively engaged in production and worked hard to become rich, opened up more than ten pieces of wasteland in addition to intensive cultivation. Last year, he harvested more grain, married a wife, built a new house, bought cotton quilts, and raised a big pig. This year, he still has enough grain. Township cadres praised him at the meeting. Zheng Xiujun, a farm laborer in Xiaqiao Township, had always been diligent, but because he mistakenly believed the rumors that "communism" was coming soon, he sold 10,000 jin of pond mud that he had originally prepared for fertilizing, ate it all, and even sold his furniture. After being educated, he regretted being deceived and is now actively engaged in diligent production again. The township used the fact of "Zheng Xiujun turning back to diligent production" to educate the farmers, which played a great role.

In the process of implementing policies, in addition to solving problems by combining specific people and specific events, all localities paid attention to praising positive examples, setting role models; criticizing bad examples, and educating the masses. Liang Huagen, a middle peasant in Qunzhong Township, was afraid of "collectivization" and did not dare to let go and develop production. The township head encouraged him and said, "Look, labor model Luo Xiequan is also a middle peasant. If production is done well, the government will reward him!" His concerns were dispelled, and he immediately cut 20,000 jin of grass fertilizer to apply to the fields. (Report from Guangdong Reporter Station of this newspaper)

### 中山县贯彻政策提高了农民的生产积极性

    中山县贯彻政策提高了农民的生产积极性
    广东省中山县在今年春耕生产中，结合具体人具体事，贯彻生产政策，消除了许多农民的思想顾虑，基本上稳定了新的生产秩序；农民生产情绪很高，开始树立了勤劳生产、爱国发家的观念。干部和群众对于今年全县要比去年增产百分之十五都有信心。
    中山县在去年秋天和今年春耕前先后完成了土地改革复查工作，今年三月宣布全县土地改革结束，转入生产。在这过渡时期中，农民对生产政策不摸底；干部缺乏生产观念，看不到农村工作发展前途，不安心农村工作，想回城市回机关，到工业部门工作或去学习，因此对农民生产不关心、不过问；不懂也不学习。有些人盲目地认为今后领导生产主要就是组织互助组，那里有互助组，就算领导生产有成绩；那里没有互助组就没有成绩。因此，产生了急躁冒进的偏向，伤害了农民的生产积极性。在实行自由借贷中，许多地区发生强迫或变相强迫借贷的现象，和随意使用人家的耕牛、农具而又不给代价的现象。由于产量未核定，农民怕增产会增加负担；过去干部在宣传社会主义前途时，片面地宣传到了社会主义如何地把土地归公和丰衣足食，而没有向农民说明怎样走到社会主义，无形中散布了“吃大锅饭”的思想。坏人、二流子乘机煽动群众出卖东西，以便从中渔利。因此，农民思想混乱，普遍怕“集体归公”，怕“互助”，怕增加负担，有的则以穷为荣，盼“共产”。各地普遍出现了大吃大喝，卖屋，卖耕牛，卖农具，砍果树等破坏生产的现象。
    根据以上情况，中山县在开始转入生产时，首先集训了县、区干部，组织干部学习了中共中央关于农村工作的文件和人民日报社论“领导农业生产的关键何在”，批判了不安心农村工作的思想，检查了过去在领导农民生产上的急躁冒进倾向。大部分干部经过学习，明确认识了当地当前领导农村工作的关键在于大力宣传贯彻政策、稳定新的生产关系。工作有了方向，劲头很大。他们下乡后，就首先大力宣传贯彻生产政策。在农忙已经开始的地区，主要采取开小组会或个别串连的办法进行宣传；在农忙还没有开始的地区，就通过农民代表会议、群众大会进行宣传。宣传的主要内容是讲解中南行政委员会公布的“关于开展农业爱国增产运动的十项措施”。通过宣布固定产量和宣传农业税政策，基本上解除了群众怕增产会增加负担的思想顾虑。
    因为对政策只是宣传而没有具体贯彻，春耕开始后群众的思想顾虑仍然不少；贫雇农的生产、生活中的一切困难还未能解决。有些地区的干部只是满足于一般的会议宣传，结果引起群众的厌烦和不满。如十一区召开群众大会，开到半夜，没有具体解决问题，结果群众逐批散伙，最后只留下几个积极分子。中共中山县委发现这种情况以后，及时指示各地抓紧当前生产季节，领导农民进行春耕生产，从检查生产入手，结合具体人具体事，更深入地贯彻政策。在各村工作的干部从此开始克服漂浮作风，深入田间，深入生产过程，及时发现和解决问题。张家边乡兴修水利的时候，为帮助贫雇农克服生产中的困难，号召组织临时帮工；但由于过去该乡组织互助组时盲目编组，违反“自愿互利”原则，许多农民吃了亏，误认为组织互助组就是“大集体”，就是不分你我，因此不愿组织。该乡领导干部就召开了互助组长会议，讨论批判了过去“大集体”（不对工、不记帐）的偏向，使大家认识到组织互助组必须“自愿互利”，认识了过去组织的互助组垮台的原因。在过去互助组中占了人家便宜的人认识到了自己的不对，都准备给吃亏户找补工资。这样一来，垮台的互助组又恢复起来了；群众害怕互助的思想顾虑消除了。
    中山县各地围绕着春耕生产，具体地贯彻政策，及时发现和解决了荒田、虫害、缺乏秧苗等问题。如平岚乡因受寒流影响，很多秧苗冻坏了；乡干部及时发动群众互助互借，使二百多亩田可以及时补种。小土地出租者德胜姐去年出租七亩田，不但收不到租，自己还要买谷子交公粮，因此今年她准备把七亩田抛荒了；干部说服佃租农民依约交租，做到了及时开耕。外沙乡有一个积极生产、勤劳致富的贫农梁龙添因精耕细作，又开了十多块荒地，去年多打了粮食，娶了媳妇，盖了新房，置了棉被，养了大猪，今年还有足够的粮食。乡干部就在会上表扬了他。下桥乡雇农郑秀君一贯勤劳但由于误信谣言，认为快“共产”了，把原来准备给自己下肥用的一万斤塘泥卖掉吃光，连家具也卖了。经教育后，他后悔自己上了当，现在又积极勤劳生产了。该乡即以“郑秀君回头勤劳生产”的事实来教育农民，起了很大作用。
    各地在贯彻政策中，除了结合具体人具体事解决问题以外，并注意表扬正面的典型，树立榜样；批判坏的典型，教育群众。群众乡中农梁华根怕
    “集体”，不敢放手发展生产，乡长鼓励他说： “你看，劳动模范罗协全也是中农，生产搞好了，政府还给他奖励呢！”他的顾虑解除了，马上去割了二万斤草肥下田。（本报广东记者站）
