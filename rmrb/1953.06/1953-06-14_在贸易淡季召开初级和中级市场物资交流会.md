    Convening Materials Exchange Meetings for Primary and Intermediate Markets During the Off-Season

    In the first quarter of this year, 3,805 primary and intermediate market materials exchange meetings were held across the country (including a small number of specialized exchange meetings), with a total transaction value of 2,324.8 billion yuan. Native and special product transactions accounted for approximately 50% of the total transaction value. Most of the exchange meetings were held before the Spring Festival. In regions where these exchange meetings were held, the needs of the masses for purchasing Spring Festival goods were basically met, Spring Festival prices were stabilized, sales channels were opened for some slow-moving local products, and some means of production needed by farmers were supplied. The exchange meetings held in March mainly supported farmers' spring plowing production, promoted the sale of farmers' local products, and supplied farmers with urgently needed means of production. These exchange meetings implemented the Central Committee's instructions on adjusting commerce and encouraged the enthusiasm of private merchants in their business operations.

    There are still some shortcomings in the organization of materials exchange meetings, which have weakened their due role.

    First, many cadres do not have a sufficient understanding of the role of materials exchange meetings. They do not understand that primary and intermediate market materials exchange meetings are an effective form of giving full play to the role of various economic components under the leadership of the state-owned economy, developing urban-rural materials exchange, and promoting industrial and agricultural production. They clearly see that local farmers urgently need to sell local products and purchase means of production, but they do not actively and purposefully organize materials exchange meetings. This is incorrect.

    Secondly, some cadres of state-owned companies and supply and marketing cooperatives lack a correct understanding of the economic accounting system. Instead of actively accelerating capital turnover and trying to expand purchasing and sales operations as much as possible, they passively reduce purchases and simply compress inventory. At materials exchange meetings, they one-sidedly promote the sale of inventory without actively encouraging private merchants to purchase farmers' local products, making it impossible to find sales channels for some local products that could have been sold. According to the statistics of Anhui Province's 101st exchange meeting, the sales volume of state-owned trading companies accounted for 40.6%, while the purchase volume accounted for only 11.24%. At the Wuhan exchange meeting, state-owned trading companies and supply and marketing cooperatives accounted for 71.31% of the local product transactions, while purchases accounted for only 22.42%. At the Choucheng exchange meeting in Yiwu County, Zhejiang Province, 7,000 dan of brown sugar were put on the market, but state-owned trading companies, supply and marketing cooperatives, and private merchants did not purchase them, which made farmers very dissatisfied.

    Third, some regions, regardless of the needs and possible conditions, blindly hold exchange meetings, lack a clear purpose, simply pursue transaction figures, pay attention to superficial formalities, and make a lot of noise, resulting in many unnecessary losses. The leading organs of Dacheng County, Hebei Province, did not lead farmers to fight drought and sow seeds during the busy farming season, but held extremely extravagant materials exchange meetings. In order to make the conference lively, they brought in opera and circus troupes from other places, with an average of five or six thousand people entering the city to watch the performances every day, but the transaction volume of the conference was very small. The total transaction value of the Xiangnan Administrative Office exchange meeting in Hunan Province was over 89.2 billion yuan, of which forward contracts accounted for 90%. This is the result of not grasping the business policy of first finding sales channels for the local products that the masses urgently need to sell, focusing on spot transactions with cash, supplemented by forward contracts. Although the transaction figures are very large, it is difficult to achieve practical results because forward contracts are highly volatile.

    It is now summer, which is the off-season for trade. Many small local products and some large local products are slow-moving. Therefore, all regions should, according to the principle of necessity and possibility, prepare to hold some primary and intermediate market materials exchange meetings centered on opening up sales channels for local products, and solve the sales problems of farmers' local products in a realistic manner. This is an important link in weathering the off-season and further revitalizing the market. Only by opening up sales channels for local products in the off-season can we increase farmers' purchasing power, support farmers' summer production, and create favorable conditions for industrial products to go to the countryside, so that the urban and rural economy can be further revitalized. To this end, in addition to carrying forward the achievements of the materials exchange meetings in the first quarter and overcoming the existing shortcomings, the following points should also be noted:

    First, the party and government leading organs in all regions should attach importance to the work of materials exchange meetings, lead relevant departments, conduct in-depth investigations and research, find out the situation of local products, and formulate practical and feasible plans for holding materials exchange meetings.

    Second, firmly grasp the policy of opening up sales channels for small local products and some large local products, supporting farmers' summer production and disaster relief work, and hold primary and intermediate market materials exchange meetings well from bottom to top. Small local products are highly localized and generally have sales channels locally. Therefore, local primary market exchange meetings should be held first to solve the sales problems of small local products. Then, the remaining larger quantities of small local products and some large local products that cannot be sold at the primary market exchange meetings should be taken to the intermediate market exchange meetings. This can avoid unnecessary commodity travel and blind circulation.

    Third, in order to make up for the shortcomings of the above-mentioned exchange meetings, port cities can draw on last year's experience and combine urban-rural exchange with domestic and foreign exchange to organize the export of local products. In addition, all regions should also draw on Zhejiang's experience this spring and hold specialized exchange meetings for slow-moving local products to specifically study the production and sales of certain local products and open up sales channels for these local products.

### 在贸易淡季召开初级和中级市场物资交流会

    在贸易淡季召开初级和中级市场物资交流会
    今年第一季度，各地召开的初级、中级市场物资交流会有三千八百零五次（其中包括少数专业交流会），成交总值有二万三千二百四十八亿元，土、特产成交额占成交总值的百分之五十左右。大部分交流会是在春节前召开的。凡是举行了这种交流会的地区，基本上满足了群众购买春节物资的需要，稳定了春节时的物价，给部分滞销土产打开销路，并且供应了部分农民所需要的生产资料。在三月份召开的交流会，以支持农民的春耕生产为主，推销了农民的土产品，供应了农民急需的生产资料。这些交流会贯彻了中央调整商业的指示，鼓舞了私商经营的积极性。
    在举办物资交流会的问题上，还存有若干缺点，因此减弱了它应有的作用。
    第一，有不少干部对物资交流会的作用还认识不够。他们不了解初级和中级市场物资交流会是在国营经济领导下，充分发挥各种经济成份的作用，开展城乡物资交流，促进工农业生产的一种有效的形式。他们明明看到当地农民迫切要求出售土产和购买生产资料，也不积极地、有目的地组织物资交流会。这是不对的。
    其次，某些国营公司及供销社的干部对于经济核算制缺乏正确的认识，他们不是积极加速资金周转，尽量扩大购销业务，而是消极的减少收购，单纯压缩库存；他们在物资交流大会上，片面地推销存货，而不积极带动私商收购农民的土产，使得某些本来可以销出去的土产找不到销路。安徽省一○一次交流会的统计，国营贸易公司销售额占百分之四十点六，而收购额仅占百分之十一点二四；武汉市交流会上成交的土产中，国营贸易公司与供销社销售的占百分之七十一点三一，收购的仅占百分之二十二点四二；浙江省义乌县稠城交流会中，红糖上市七千担，国营贸易公司、供销社、私商都不收购，农民大为不满。
    第三，有些地区不顾需要和可能的条件，盲目召开交流会，缺乏明确的目的，单纯追求成交数字，讲究表面形式，搞得轰轰烈烈，结果造成许多不应有的损失。河北省大城县领导机关在农忙时节，不去领导农民抗旱播种，却举办了极其铺张的物资交流会。为了把大会开的热热闹闹，他们从外地接来大戏和马戏班，每天平均有五、六千人进城看戏，但大会成交额却很少。湖南省湘南行署交流会成交总值八百九十二亿余元，其中期款期货占百分之九十。这是没有掌握首先给群众迫切需要出售的土产品找销路，以现款现货为主，辅之以期款期货的业务方针的结果。虽说成交数字很大，但由于期款期货变化性大，很难收到实际的效果。
    目前已是夏季，正是贸易的淡季，各地有许多小土产和一部分大土产滞销，因此，各地应该根据需要和可能的原则，有准备地召开一些以打开土产销路为中心的初级和中级市场的物资交流会，实事求是地解决农民土产的销路问题。这是稳度淡季、进一步活跃市场的重要环节。只有在淡季给土产打开销路，才能增加农民的购买力，支持农民的夏季生产，并给工业品下乡创造有利的条件，使城乡经济进一步活跃起来。为此，除了应该发扬第一季度物资交流会的成绩和克服存在的缺点以外，还应注意以下几点：
    第一，各地党政领导机关应该重视物资交流会的工作，领导有关部门，进行深入的调查研究，摸清当地土产的情况，制订实际可行的召开物资交流会的计划。
    第二，紧紧掌握为小土产和部分大土产打开销路，支援农民夏季生产和救灾工作的方针，自下而上地开好初级的和中级市场的物资交流会。小土产的地方性很大，一般在本地就有销路，因此，应该首先召开地方性的初级市场交流会，解决小土产的销路问题。然后把初级市场交流会推销不了的剩余的较大宗的小土产和部分大土产，拿到中级市场交流会上。这样可以避免不必要的商品旅行与盲目流转。
    第三，为了弥补上述交流会的不足，口岸城市可以吸取去年的经验，把城乡交流和内外交流结合起来，组织土产出口。此外，各地还应该吸取今春浙江的经验，召开滞销土产专业交流会，专门研究某种土产的产销情况，为这些土产打开销路。
