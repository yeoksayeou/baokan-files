Xinhua News Agency, 5th: Singapore Dispatch: The Malayan tin industry, deeply affected by the American "embargo" policy, has further contracted. Many mines have closed down one after another.

The export of tin from Malaya has plummeted from 6,866 tons in March to 4,813 tons in April. Due to shrinking sales, tin prices have continued to fall. In April, the price of tin fell by nearly 100 Malayan dollars per picul. On April 24, the price of tin fell to 345 dollars per picul, the lowest price since July 1950. Compared with the highest price of 780 dollars per picul in 1951, it has fallen by about 56 percent.

The British colonial government of Malaya admits that due to the sharp drop in tin prices, 20 mines in Perak alone have been closed. According to newspaper reports, by the beginning of May, 30 mines in the Federation of Malaya had been closed, and many other mines are facing the threat of closure.

Xinhua News Agency, 5th: The American policy of suppressing rubber prices by using "embargoes" and other measures has aroused dissatisfaction among British merchants in Singapore. According to United Press International reports, British merchants in Singapore believe that the U.S. government is using tactics such as producing synthetic rubber and refusing to continue purchasing natural rubber to manipulate rubber prices and threaten Malaya. In the "Tanglin Club" of the British in Singapore, "these days, few people hear good words about Uncle Sam," and the United States has been accused of being an "economic thug."

    在美国“禁运”政策的影响下
    马来亚锡业再度萎缩
    新加坡英商不满美国压低胶价
    【新华社五日讯】新加坡消息：深受美国“禁运”政策影响的马来亚锡业，进一步萎缩。许多矿场纷纷倒闭。
    马来亚输出的锡，已由三月份的六千八百六十六吨激减到四月份的四千八百一十三吨。因销路萎缩，锡价不断下跌。在四月份，每担锡跌了将近马来亚币一百元。四月二十四日，锡价跌到每担三百四十五元，为一九五零年七月以来最低的价格，如果把它和一九五一年的最高价格每担七百八十元比较，已经跌了约百分之五十六。
    马来亚英国殖民政府承认，由于锡价猛跌，单单在霹雳州，已有二十个矿场关闭。据报纸消息：到五月初，马来亚联合邦已有三十个矿场关闭，另外还有许多矿场正面临着关闭的威胁。
    【新华社五日讯】美国利用“禁运”等措施压低橡胶价格的政策，引起了新加坡英国商人的不满。据合众社报道，新加坡的英国商人认为，美国政府用生产人造橡胶、拒绝继续收购天然橡胶等操纵橡胶价格的手段，来威胁马来亚。在新加坡英国人的“东陵俱乐部”中，“这些天来很少有人听到关于山姆大叔的好话”，美国已被指责为“经济暴徒”。
