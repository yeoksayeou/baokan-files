    The Shandong Provincial People's Government has achieved some results and gained experience in seriously handling proposals from people's representatives conferences over the past two years. The proposals from the First Shandong Provincial People's Representatives Conference (Second Session) have been basically processed, and the proposals from the Second Shandong Provincial People's Representatives Conference (First Session) are also being processed. The First Shandong Provincial People's Representatives Conference (Second Session) collected a total of 692 proposals. Among these proposals, except for some that cannot be handled due to objective conditions, 374 proposals contained content that the government should and could handle, in whole or in part. These have been submitted to the government or relevant departments for study and handling. Of these 374 proposals, except for three where the address is unknown and are still being investigated, the remaining 371 have been fully processed. For proposals that cannot be processed temporarily, explanations have been provided to the original proposers, basically ensuring that each item is accounted for and each case has a resolution.
    The Shandong Provincial People's Government's success in handling proposals from people's representatives is inseparable from the leadership's attention, repeated inspections, supervision, research, and timely identification and resolution of problems. For example, before June last year, various departments in the province were busy with the "Three-Anti" campaign, which affected the implementation of proposals from the First Shandong Provincial People's Representatives Conference (Second Session). It was not until after June, when the Provincial People's Government issued a notice and organized cadres to go deep into various departments to urge action, that the departments began to report on the implementation of the proposals in September. This urging revealed that some departments had not conducted thorough checks and understanding. In order to report to the higher authorities, they temporarily pieced together some information or simply copied the original handling opinions to get by. Some departments only reported the handling process, such as saying that a certain issue had been transferred to a certain department for handling, but it was unknown whether the issue had been handled or how it had been handled. Some proposals involved more than two departments, but the lead department failed to actively contact relevant departments to handle the matter jointly, instead shifting responsibility to each other, making it impossible to resolve the issue. Some departments, in order to save trouble, merged proposals that should not have been merged, thus only solving the same issues in the proposals, while ignoring the different issues. Some departments did not handle the proposals that should be handled one by one, but wrote comprehensive reports by category, thus failing to resolve the specific issues that needed to be resolved in each case. Some things had already been done, but they still said they were striving to include them in the 1953 plan. In response to these serious irresponsible phenomena, the Shandong Provincial People's Government issued notices and orders in September and October last year, pointing out the problems existing in the handling of proposals, requiring all departments to re-examine the handling of proposals with a responsible attitude, and to handle the unhandled or improperly handled proposals in a timely manner. At the same time, it also sent cadres to various departments to inspect and urge action. In late October, the People's Government convened a meeting of the directors of the secretariat of the directly subordinate departments of the province, summarized the work of handling proposals in the previous stage, and discussed the steps and methods to strive to complete the handling of all proposals in a timely manner. The meeting specifically stipulated: 1. All proposals that were approved for handling, reference handling, or planned handling in the handling opinions must be handled conscientiously, and the handling situation must be reported; 2. When reporting the handling results, a case-by-case reply is required, and only when the contents of the entire proposal are completely consistent can the cases be answered together; 3. The reported results should be specific and clear, and should not be vague or general; 4. If a proposal has several contents, the handling and implementation should be reported at one time. If only one or several of them have been handled, the handling situation should be reported, as well as the handling plan for each item that has not been handled. 5. If several departments handle the matter jointly, the lead department must actively contact the relevant departments to handle the matter conscientiously. After this meeting, all departments paid much more attention to the handling of proposals than before. Except for a small number of proposals that were completed in March this year due to the checking of the situation, the vast majority of the remaining proposals were completed by the end of last year.
    In addition, in order to prepare for the convening of the Second Shandong Provincial People's Representatives Conference (First Session), the province began to issue notices in the winter of last year to solicit proposals from representatives. Since December last year, it has been collecting and sorting out proposals at the same time, reaching 2,080 by the end of January. On February 5th, a proposal sorting committee was convened. After research, the proposals were first sent to the relevant departments to put forward preliminary handling opinions. After being reviewed and approved by the Provincial People's Government, they were handled separately.
    In addition to the leadership's attention, the main experiences of Shandong Province in handling proposals from people's representatives conferences are as follows:
    1. Seriously and solemnly treat proposals from the people, and implement this spirit from the beginning of soliciting proposals. Before soliciting proposals, it is necessary to carry out propaganda and mobilization work among the broad masses of the people, and mobilize the masses to deliberate proposals in checking and discussing government work. After the representatives are elected, they should also go deep into the masses to solicit proposals. So that the proposals can reflect the existing problems and situations in the current work, as well as specific opinions and requirements for strengthening and improving government work. Matters that are purely local in nature or individual specific problems that can be handled and resolved by the local government should be handled and resolved immediately, or discussed and resolved at the county (city) people's representatives conferences. For matters that should be sent to the Provincial People's Representatives Conference for resolution, the special district and county (city) governments should also seriously study and put forward preliminary handling opinions. In this way, it can not only widely solicit the opinions of the people and fully promote democracy, but also quickly solve problems, so that matters, no matter how big or small, are pushed to the Provincial People's Representatives Conference, resulting in the transfer up and down, delaying the time to solve problems, and causing difficulties in handling proposals.
    2. After receiving proposals from various places, in order to be able to combine the specific situation and quickly and correctly handle them, they can be sorted according to the nature of the proposals and sent to the relevant competent departments for research to put forward preliminary handling opinions. And explain clearly to all departments: which proposals should be handled, which proposals can be used as reference, and which proposals can be handled together or should be handled jointly with relevant departments. For urgent problems in the proposals that need to be solved, the handling opinions should be reported while handling them. In this way, a foundation can be laid in the initial handling for seriously handling the things that should be handled and the problems that should be solved in the proposals.
    3. Because the number of representatives' proposals is large, the handling of proposals from one representatives' conference often continues until the next representatives' conference. At the same time, all agencies are busy with work, and there are still shortcomings in the leadership's democratic thinking and democratic style. Therefore, in the entire process of handling proposals, it is necessary to stipulate a strict reporting system, conduct regular inspections, and timely identify and solve various problems in handling proposals, in order to continuously promote this work; and notify the proposers of the results of the handling at any time. Otherwise, it is easy to fall into spontaneous and passive situations.
    4. Handling proposals is a meticulous, complex, and consistently serious and responsible task. Therefore, from the collection of proposals to the completion of handling, it is necessary to designate a dedicated person to be responsible for management. Establish necessary systems and procedures, and implement special files for special cases. Find problems and check them in time to avoid confusion.

### 山东省人民政府认真处理各界人民代表会议的提案

    山东省人民政府认真处理各界人民代表会议的提案
    山东省人民政府认真处理各界人民代表会议的提案，两年来已获得了些成绩和经验。省一届二次各界人民代表会议代表提案已基本处理完毕，省二届一次各界人民代表会议的代表提案也正在处理中。省一届二次各界人民代表会议共征集提案六百九十二件。这些提案中除了一些限于客观条件目前尚不能办理的以外，提案内容全部或一部为政府应该办理也可能办理的计有三百七十四件，现已交政府或有关部门研究办理。在这三百七十四件中除有三件因地址不明正在继续查询办理外，其余三百七十一件已全部办理完毕。对于目前暂时不能办理的提案，都一一向原提案人进行了解释，基本上作到了件件有交代，案案有着落。
    山东省人民政府在处理人民代表提案中，所以能获得成绩，是和领导重视，一再检查、督促和研究，及时发现问题、解决问题分不开的。如去年六月份以前，该省各部门都忙于“三反”，影响了对省一届二次各界人民代表会议代表提案的执行。一直到六月份以后，经过省人民政府发出通知，组织干部深入各部门进行催办后，各部门才从九月份开始，陆续将提案执行情况作了报告。经过这次催办，发现有的部门未作认真深入的检查和了解，为了向上面报告，就临时凑了一些情况，或将原处理意见照抄一遍，应付了事；有的部门仅将办理的过程报告一下，如说某个问题已转某处处理，但该项问题是否已经处理，怎样处理就不知道了；有些提案内容涉及到两个部门以上的，主办部门也未能主动联系有关部门会同办理，反而相互推诿，使问题不能解决；有的部门为了省事，把本不应该合并处理的提案合并处理，因而只能解决提案中相同的问题，不同的问题就忽略过去而得不到解决；有的部门不是将应办的提案逐件处理，而是分类写综合报告，因而也不能解决各案中要求解决的具体问题；有的事情已经办过了，还说争取列入一九五三年计划内。对于这些严重的不负责现象，山东省人民政府在去年九、十月份先后发出通知和命令，指出办理提案中存在的问题，要各部门重新检查提案处理工作，以认真负责的态度，将未办或办得不妥当的提案及时办理；同时又派干部到各部门检查催办。到十月下旬人民政府又召开省直属各部门秘书主任会议，总结了前一阶段处理提案工作，讨论了如何争取及时将全部提案办理完毕的步骤和方法。会上具体规定：一、凡处理意见中批明办理、参考办理、计划办理的提案均须认真办理，并将办理情况报告；二、报告办理结果时要一案一答，整个提案内容完全一致的才能并案答复；三、报告结果要具体明确，不得含糊笼统；四、一个提案中有几项内容的要求一次报告办理执行情况，只办了其中的一项或几项的，应报告已办的情况和未办各项的办理计划。五、几个部门会同办理的，主办部门必须主动联系有关部门认真办理。经过此次会议后，各部门对提案办理工作较前大为重视，除有一小部分提案因查对情况至今年三月份办理完毕外，其余绝大部分提案都在去年年底办完。
    另外，该省为准备召开省二届一次各界人民代表会议，于去年冬天就开始发出通知征集代表提案。自去年十二月份开始即一面收集，一面整理，到一月底已达二千零八十件。二月五日召开了提案整理委员会，经研究后，先将提案送交各有关部门提出初步处理意见，经省人民政府审查批准后即分别办理。
    山东省在处理各界人民代表提案中的主要经验除领导重视外，还有以下几点：
    一、认真严肃对待来自人民群众的提案，从开始征集提案时就要贯彻这种精神。征集提案之先，必须在广大人民群众中进行宣传动员工作，发动群众在检查和讨论政府工作中酝酿提案。代表选出后也应深入群众征集提案。使提案既能反映当前工作中存在的问题与情况，又有加强与改进政府工作的具体意见和要求。纯粹属于地方性的事项或个别具体问题，当地政府能够处理解决的，应立即处理解决，或在县（市）各界人民代表会议上讨论解决。应送省各界人民代表会议解决的，专署、县（市）政府也应认真研究提出初步处理意见。这样，既能广泛征集人民群众意见，充分发扬民主，又可迅速解决问题，不致事无大小，都推到省各界人民代表会议上来，以至上下转送，拖延解决问题的时间，造成处理提案的困难。
    二、收到各地提案以后，为了能够结合具体情况，迅速正确处理，可先按提案性质分别整理，送交有关主管部门研究，提出初步处理意见。并向各部门交代清楚：哪种提案是应该办理的，哪种提案可作为参考的，以及哪种提案可并案处理或者应与有关部门会同办理的。对提案中的急须解决的问题，应一面办理，一面报告处理意见。这样就可在初步处理中，为认真办理提案中应该办理的事情和应该解决的问题打下基础。
    三、由于代表提案的数量较多，处理一次代表会议的提案，往往是延续到下次代表会议之前，同时各机关工作繁忙，领导上的民主思想和民主作风还有缺点。因此，在处理提案的整个过程中，必须规定严格的报告制度、并定期的进行检查，及时发现与解决处理提案中的各种问题，以不断推动这一工作的进行；并将办理有结果的随时通知提案人。否则即易陷于自流和被动。
    四、处理提案是一件细密的、复杂的、自始至终严肃负责的工作，因此，从征集提案到办理完毕，都必须指定专人负责管理。建立必要的制度和手续，实行专案专档。发现问题及时查对，以免紊乱。
