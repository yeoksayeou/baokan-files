    Implement the Electoral Law and Carry Out Universal Suffrage Work
    Jinan City Implements a Household Visit and Registration Method in Key Pilot Areas for Universal Suffrage
    In Jinan City, the electoral districts in the key pilot areas for universal suffrage have announced the list of voters. During the population survey and voter registration, a household visit method was also tested.

    Before the voter list was announced, each electoral district conducted a final review to determine the voter eligibility of a small number of people whose eligibility was difficult to determine during registration. Those who should be deprived of political rights were sentenced by the People's Court. Many electoral districts also broadly understood the voters' situation before the voter list was announced, such as the voters' original organizations, industries, the time they could participate in election activities, and how many activists there were and where they were distributed. After the voter list was announced, voters were immediately divided into groups under leadership to carry out activities. When making the lists, electoral districts with faster progress first made samples, and the district election committee studied and stipulated a unified format and method, and then the electoral districts referred to it for formulation. In order to facilitate public consultation, the format listed names in order of street, house number, household number, etc.

    Some electoral districts also paid attention to listing names in order of age within each household when writing the list, which the masses were satisfied with; some electoral districts did not pay enough attention to the order of listing, and divided the names of the same household into several places, or reversed the order of age, which was not only inconvenient for the masses to consult, but also easily aroused public dissatisfaction. Before making the lists, most electoral districts also carefully selected people with better writing skills to write, and people who were familiar with the residents' situation to proofread, and educated these staff members to enable them to work seriously and responsibly.

    The voter lists were all written in regular script on red paper. After the voter lists were announced, the general public responded very well and were happy to see their names. Some women became particularly active and said, "Today our names are also on the red list, we must carefully check the list to see if any bad people have mixed in and whether any good people have been missed!" A landlord element named Zhang Shuzhen, who concealed his status and was not discovered during the review, was quickly exposed under the careful scrutiny of the masses.

    When conducting population surveys and voter registration in the second batch of electoral districts, in order to learn from experience, the method of door-to-door visits was tested in the Wangfu Pond and Shengfu Qianjie electoral districts. The method of door-to-door visits was formulated on the basis of summarizing and absorbing the experience of the first batch of electoral districts in using registration stations to conduct population surveys and voter registration; therefore, it only differs from the registration station method in specific organization and implementation steps. In order to ensure balanced development with the work of registration stations in other electoral districts, according to the central government's regulations and the population figures of each electoral district, three guidance cadres and twelve technical cadres were transferred under the unified leadership of the universal suffrage working group, and divided into six door-to-door visit working groups, adopting the method of being responsible for different streets. Each group had one person in charge of population survey, one person in charge of voter registration (and issuing voter certificates), and was equipped with two elected review team members and a street propagandist who was most familiar with the residents' situation. Every two groups had a guidance cadre who focused on leading voter review work, and checked and helped the groups solve some temporary problems at any time. The working steps were: first, after in-depth publicity and mobilization and basically clarifying the relevant information on voter eligibility, the street propagandist first notified the residents to prepare door-to-door (and tried to do some simple publicity and explanation work), and then the population survey personnel, voter eligibility review personnel, and voter registration personnel immediately went to conduct registration; in the evening, according to the registration situation records and preliminary checks, they went to a few blank households and households with errors to supplement registration and inquiries to correct errors. The second step was review. After all streets completed registration, they used the population survey form to compare with the voter registration form and the household registration active signature of the police station to check the number of voters and other items for review and correction.

    Practice has proved that the method of door-to-door visits is also feasible. It can not only achieve accuracy, but also has simple procedures and is extremely convenient for the masses, and does not hinder mass production. For example, family labor women, small handicraftsmen, and small vendors can work while registering. They are all very satisfied with this approach and generally reflected: this method is really good, the work is done, and the registration is done, and neither is delayed. The masses greatly praised the hard work of the registration staff. At the same time, because on-site registration is convenient for contacting and relying on the masses, it is also easy to discover black people, black households, and other problems; because it is registered in order of house number and household number by the registration staff, it is also convenient for checking and statistical work. However, some shortcomings were also found, such as it is not easy to combine registration work with in-depth publicity and education, and the review team members are dispersed and it is not easy to give play to the role of organization. In this experiment, there were also individual review team members who were embarrassed to fully exert their role.

    Sichuan Province Has Achieved Preliminary Experience in Mobilizing the Masses in the Typical Pilot Work of Universal Suffrage
    In Sichuan Province, preliminary experience has been gained in mobilizing the masses in the typical pilot work of universal suffrage. More than 130 grassroots election typical pilot townships in the province have now completed population surveys, voter registration, and other work, and have successively entered the stage of resolving cadre-mass relations and deliberating and proposing candidates for representatives. The pilot townships in Jiangjin, Neijiang, Suining, and other counties, where work started earlier, have held election conferences, elected people's representatives, and established township people's governments.

    In the typical pilot work, all counties have paid attention to closely combining universal suffrage with production on the premise of focusing on production. According to the experience of various townships, first start from the demands of the masses and gradually guide the masses to combine universal suffrage with production. For example, when the Jian'ge County working group went to Liuya Township for initial experiments, some working cadres said: The masses have to produce during the day, and they are tired in the evening. Now is not the time for elections. After understanding the situation, the leading cadres of the working group immediately consulted with the township and village cadres and the masses to determine five methods for combining universal suffrage and production, overcoming the thinking of cadres who were generally worried about delaying production. Therefore, they actively participated in universal suffrage publicity and related work. For another example, after the Dazhou County working group went to Luojiang Township, they quickly divided into several working groups, went deep into the fields and courtyards to understand the situation, launched small-scale publicity activities, and helped the masses plant rice seedlings and apply fertilizer, using evenings or production gaps to slowly talk about the significance of universal suffrage and why it is necessary to conduct population surveys and voter registration. Because a close relationship was established between the cadres and the masses, the peasants easily accepted the propaganda. When the working cadres used the method of door-to-door registration to conduct population surveys and voter registration, the masses enthusiastically participated. It only took one day for the sixth village to complete the population survey and voter registration of the entire village. Although the first village was mountainous and the residents were scattered, the three working cadres only took half a day to register 83 households and 318 people. The universal suffrage work in the township was therefore successfully carried out and promoted production.

    Localities have also paid attention to relying on the original cadres and various organizations in rural areas, starting from checking the leadership of production, to resolve the relationship between cadres and the masses, and fully mobilizing the masses to actively participate in universal suffrage. Experience has proved that the masses who have done this well have been well mobilized, and the unity between cadres and the masses has been strengthened. Individual townships did not do this at the beginning, and mobilized the masses without the township and village cadres; the cadres suspected, and the masses also suspected, causing the work to take a detour.

    In addition, regarding the issue of universal suffrage propaganda, various localities have criticized and corrected the hasty method of one-time instillation, and adopted the method of gradual explanation and gradual deepening according to the masses' ideological situation and the order of work development. Some have also combined local living people and real events with recall and comparison methods to improve the peasants' awareness and correct the erroneous thinking of some peasants who only bury their heads in production, care about economic interests, and do not care about political interests.

    Currently, many townships have convened election conferences. Some townships have particularly corrected some cadres' erroneous view of regarding the election conference as a purely lively formality before the election conference, and have carried out meticulous organizational work. For example, before the election conference, Gongnong Township in Neijiang County went deep into the situation and specifically solved various problems such as the need for farmers to leave someone at home to feed the cattle, prevent fires, and the elderly walking, ensuring that 91.6% of the voters participated in the election. In addition to paying attention to solving general problems, the third village of the township also paid special attention to solving the specific problems of female voters, such as taking care of children, cooking, and walking, so that more than 83% of the female voters exercised their right to vote.

    Regarding the above experience, the Sichuan Provincial People's Government and the Provincial Election Committee recently convened a joint meeting of commissioners of various prefectures and team leaders of the universal suffrage base point townships directly led by the province to discuss and summarize, and are preparing to promote these experiences throughout the province.

    贯彻选举法，开展普选工作
    济南市在普选重点试办中试行逐户访查登记办法
    济南市普选重点试办各选区已公布了选民名单，在人口调查选民登记工作中还试行了逐户访查办法。
    选民名单公布前，各选区都对少数在登记时难于确定有无选民资格的人作了最后审查确定。对于应被剥夺政治权利的，由人民法庭宣判剥夺。有许多选区在选民名单公布前，还大体了解了选民情况，如选民原有组织、行业、有那些时间可以参加选举活动，以及有多少积极分子，分布在那些地方等。在选民名单公布后，随即领导选民划分小组展开活动。制榜时，先由进度较快的选区作出小样，经区选举委员会研究规定统一的格式和制法，各选区再参照制定。为了便于群众参阅，格式是按街道、门牌、户数等次第列名。
    有的选区在写榜时还注意了每户按长幼次序列名，群众感到满意；有的选区因为对列名次序注意不够，把同户名单分列在好几处，或把长幼次序倒置，既不便于群众查阅，也容易引起群众不满。制榜前，绝大部分选区也都认真挑选了书写较好的人员书写，和对居民情况较熟悉的人作校对，并对这些工作人员进行了教育，使他们能够严肃认真的工作。
    选民榜都用红纸写的正楷，选民名单公布后，一般群众反映很好，见到自己的名字真是高兴。有些妇女特别积极起来，说“今天自己的名字也一样上了红榜，可得好好查看一下榜上有没有坏人混上来和好人有没有被遗漏！”有一个隐瞒成份、审查时未经发现的地主分子张淑贞，在群众认真查阅下，很快就被检举出来了。
    在第二批选区进行人口调查和选民登记时，为了吸取经验，曾在王府池子和省府前街两个选区试行了逐户访查的办法。逐户访查的办法是在总结和吸取第一批各选区用登记站的办法进行人口调查和选民登记的经验的基础上拟定的；因此，它只在具体组织和进行步骤上与登记站的办法有所不同。为了保证与其他选区登记站的工作平衡发展，根据中央规定和各该选区的人口数字，这两个选区在普选工作组统一领导下抽调了三名指导干部和十二名技术干部，分成六个逐户访查工作组，采取分街负责的办法进行工作。每组有一人主管人口调查，一人主管选民登记（并发选民证），另配备两个民选的审查组员及最为熟悉居民情况的一个街道宣传员，每两个组有一个指导干部着重领导选民审查工作，并随时检查和帮助组里解决一些临时遇到的问题。工作步骤，第一步是在经过深入宣传动员及基本上弄清选民资格的有关情况后，街道宣传员先挨门挨户通知居民准备（并尽量作一些简单的宣传解释工作），然后人口调查人员、选民资格审查人员和选民登记人员即依次紧接前往，进行登记；晚间即根据登记情况记录和初步检查发现的差错，到少数空白户和发生差错的户进行补登和查询，以纠正差错。第二步是复查。各街于全部登记完毕后，即以人口调查表对照选民登记表和派出所户口活签，核对选民人数和其他项目，进行审查改正。
    试验证明，逐户访查的方法也是可行的。它不仅同样可以作到准确无误，而且手续简便，并极便利群众，不致妨碍群众生产。如家庭劳动妇女、小手工业者、小商贩等可以一面工作，一面登记。他们都很满意这样办，普遍反映：这办法真好，活也干了，也登记了，两不耽误。群众对登记人员不辞劳苦的精神十分赞扬。同时，由于到现场登记便于联系群众和依靠群众，也就易于发现黑人黑户和其他问题；由于是按门牌户数顺序并由登记人员亲自前往登记，也便于进行查核统计工作。但也发现一些缺点，如不易结合登记工作进行深入宣传教育，审查组员力量分散不易发挥组织作用，在这次试验中，还有个别的审查组员碍于情面，不能充分发挥其作用的情况。

    四川省普选典型试办工作中已取得发动群众的初步经验
    四川省在普选典型试办工作中，已取得发动群众的初步经验。该省一百三十多个基层选举典型试办乡，目前已完成人口调查、选民登记等工作，先后进入了解决干部、群众关系和酝酿提出代表候选人的阶段。工作开始较早的江津、内江、遂宁等县的试办乡，已开过选举大会，举出了人民代表，成立了乡人民政府。
    各县在典型试办工作中，都注意在以生产为主的前提下，密切结合生产进行普选。根据各乡的经验，首先从群众的要求出发，逐步诱导群众把普选与生产结合起来。譬如剑阁县工作组到柳垭乡实验初期，部分工作干部说：白天群众要生产，晚间又疲乏，现在选举真不是时候。工作组领导干部了解后，立刻和乡村干部及群众商量，确定了五项普选和生产结合的办法，克服了干部因怕耽误生产而普遍产生的换班思想。因而积极地参加了普选宣传和有关工作。又如达县工作组到罗江乡后，很快就分成若干工作小组，深入田间、院子，进行了解情况，展开小型宣传活动，并帮助群众栽秧、施肥，利用晚间或生产间隙，从摆家常慢慢谈到普选的意义，以及为什么要进行人口调查和选民登记等。由于干部和群众之间建立了亲密的关系，农民很容易接受宣传。当工作干部采用逐户登记的方法，进行人口调查和选民登记时，群众都热烈地参加。六村只用了一天的时间就完成了全村的人口调查和选民登记工作。一村虽是山地，居民又分散，但三个工作干部，仅用半天时间就登记了八十三户、三百一十八人。该乡普选工作因此获得顺利开展，并推动了生产。
    各地在试办工作中还注意了依靠农村中原有的干部和各种组织，从检查领导生产入手，来解决干部和群众关系，充分发动群众积极参加普选。经验证明：凡是这样做了的群众，发动的就好，并加强了干部和群众的团结。个别乡开始没有这样做，撇开乡、村干部去动员群众；干部怀疑，群众也怀疑，使工作走了弯路。
    此外，对于普选的宣传问题，各地曾批判和纠正了一次灌输的急躁办法，而采取根据群众思想情况和工作发展顺序，实行逐步交代、逐步深入的办法。有的并结合本地活人活事用回忆对比的方式，提高了农民的觉悟，纠正了部分农民只埋头生产，关心经济利益不关心政治利益的错误思想。
    目前，许多乡已经召开了选举大会。有的乡在选举大会以前特别纠正了一些干部把选举大会当成单纯闹闹形式的错误观点，进行了细致的组织工作。如内江县工农乡在选举大会前，深入了解情况，具体解决了农民们参加会议时家里要留人喂牛、防火以及老年人走路等各种问题，保证了百分之九十一点六的选民参加了选举。该乡第三村除注意一般问题的解决外，还特别注意解决了女选民的看孩子、做饭、走路等具体问题，使百分之八十三以上的女选民行使了她们的选举权利。
    对于以上经验，四川省人民政府和省选举委员会在最近曾专门召开了各专区专员和省直接领导的普选基点乡工作队长联席会议，进行讨论和总结，并准备把这些经验在全省普遍推行。（据新华社讯）
