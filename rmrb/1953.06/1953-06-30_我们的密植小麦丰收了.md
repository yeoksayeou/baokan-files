    Our Densely Planted Wheat Has a Bumper Harvest
    Fu Guangxian and Fu Suzhen, farmers from Xudian Village, Wuzhi County, Henan Province, write: We are members of the Fu Guangying Agricultural Production Cooperative in Liang Xudian, District 1, Wuzhi County. During the wheat competition, our cooperative mobilized the masses of the county, labor models, and experienced old farmers to visit and evaluate. The masses who came to our cooperative saw our 2.07 mu of high-yield land, where the wheat stalks were over four chi tall, the ears were large and plentiful, and the grains were full and dense, with an average of thirty grains per ear. They were all very envious. Our wheat was planted using the newly improved dense planting drill, with a row spacing of four and a half cun. The seeds were the "Bamboo Pole Green" variety, selected from the field last year by ear selection. After careful calculation of ears and grains by comrades from the county and district work teams, each mu can yield more than 800 jin. We have never seen such good wheat. It seems that dense planting can really increase production. Last year, these 2.07 mu of wheat only yielded more than 350 jin per mu, which was planted with an old drill, sparsely planted, and the seeds were also the "Bamboo Pole Green" variety, but it used one-fifth less seed than this year. Now, people in our village believe in the benefits of dense planting.
    Another reason for the bumper wheat harvest is that we strengthened field management this spring. Our cooperative's wheat was irrigated three times in stages, and fertilizer was applied rationally. Women went to the fields to remove all the weeds. All the farmers in the village also learned agricultural techniques from our cooperative. Therefore, this year, our cooperative's 260.07 mu of wheat can yield an average of 368 jin per mu; our entire village's wheat is growing well. The masses say that this year's wheat is better than any other year. Now, our cooperative is leading the entire village in planting immediately after harvesting, preparing to strive for an autumn harvest.

### 我们的密植小麦丰收了

专栏：读者来信摘要

    我们的密植小麦丰收了
    河南省武陟县徐店村农民傅光显、傅素真来信：我们是武陟县一区梁徐店傅光莹农业生产合作社的社员。在小麦评比当中，俺社发动了全县群众、劳动模范和技术老农，进行参观评比。来俺社参观的群众看见俺的二亩零七厘高额丰产地，麦稞长有四尺多高，穗头大又多，籽粒饱又密，每穗平均有三十粒，都很羡慕。俺这麦是用新改的密植耧种的，行距四寸半宽；种籽是“竹杆青”品种，是去年经过田间穗选选出来的。经过县区工作组同志们查穗查籽细算，每亩能收八百多斤。我们从来没有见过这样好的麦子。照这样看来，密植真是能丰产。去年这二亩零七厘麦，每亩只收了三百五十多斤，那是用老耧耩的，种得稀，种籽也是“竹杆青”品种，可是比今年少用了五分之一。现在，我们村里的人都相信密植好了。
    小麦丰收的另一个原因，是今年春天俺加强了麦田管理。俺全社的小麦都分期浇了三遍水，合理施了肥，妇女们都下地拔净了草。全村农民也都跟俺社学习农业技术。所以今年俺全社二百六十亩零七厘小麦，每亩平均可收三百六十八斤；俺全村小麦长的都不错。群众都说今年麦子比那一年都好。现在我们全社正在带动全村随收随种，准备争取秋季丰收。
