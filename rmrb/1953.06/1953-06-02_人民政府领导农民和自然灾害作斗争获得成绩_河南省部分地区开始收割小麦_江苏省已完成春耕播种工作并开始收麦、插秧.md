The People's Government Leads Farmers in Struggle Against Natural Disasters, Achieving Success
Parts of Henan Province Begin Harvesting Wheat
Jiangsu Province Completes Spring Planting and Begins Harvesting Wheat and Transplanting Rice
    The summer harvest and planting preparations in various parts of Henan Province are underway, with some areas already beginning to harvest wheat.
    After Henan wheat suffered severe frost damage, local leadership organs took various effective measures to vigorously lead farmers in irrigating and protecting wheat seedlings, achieving significant results. It is estimated that the province can maintain 63% of its wheat harvest; in areas with light damage and those unaffected by frost, wheat yields may even exceed last year's.
    Now that the wheat is about to ripen, and the province experienced widespread rainfall on May 20th, in order to strive for a greater harvest, a good harvest, and an abundant autumn harvest, farmers in various places are actively carrying out specific preparations for the summer harvest and planting. The Mayingxuan Agricultural Production Cooperative in Huojia County, in order to rationally use labor and farm tools, organized two cultivation teams, with specific divisions of labor according to the technical expertise of the cooperative members, ensuring that the wheat is harvested and brought to the threshing ground as soon as it ripens, completing the harvest in three days to prevent any loss of wheat ears. They are also paying attention to preventing wind, fire, and theft, strictly preventing sabotage by lawbreakers. Simultaneously with the wheat harvest, they are ensuring timely planting of all autumn crops, striving to increase grain production and preparing for long-term emergencies. Last year, the cooperative's autumn crop area was 118 mu; this year, they plan to reduce the amount of fallow dry wheat land and expand the autumn crop area to 140 mu. During the wheat harvest, in addition to assigning eight people to be responsible for threshing and managing the vegetable garden, all other people are participating in drought resistance and planting work.
    The Yang Tianyun mutual aid team in Dianzhuang Township, Sixth District of Luoyang, continuously fought against red spiders, wheat midges, frost damage, and fog damage, and it is estimated that this year's wheat production will not be less than last year's. Team members held tense and excited meetings to study how to carry out the summer harvest and planting work. The team's two carpenters divided the work of repairing plow bottoms, wagon bodies, and roller frames to ensure that the harvest would not be delayed. They also made technical divisions of labor. The team has eleven male laborers and ten female laborers, and everyone will go to the fields during the harvest. When the wheat is transported to the field, team leader Yang Tianyun leads ten men and women to be responsible for threshing, while the remaining team members, led by deputy team leader Yang Shumin, harvest wheat, plow the land, and plant at the same time, ensuring timely planting and leaving no land unplanted.
    The Fifth District of Zhengzhou suburban area suffered very little frost damage, and the wheat is generally growing better than last year. The Chen Guogan mutual aid team in Liuhutong Township implemented a rational division of labor between labor and animal power, and the entire team harvested eight mu of red mang coarse wheat in one night, and planted late autumn crops the very next morning. Chenliu County has had a bumper wheat harvest this year, estimated to increase by 20-30% compared to last year.
    Currently, wheat has begun to be marketed in some areas, and the amount being marketed is increasing daily. State-owned grain and trade departments and cooperatives are seizing the time to carry out business, concentrating their efforts to serve the summer harvest and planting. The Chenliu County Grain Company has purchased barley and peas, and has signed agency purchase and sales contracts with cooperatives to purchase wheat; at the same time, it has prepared 300,000 jin of soybean seeds to supply farmers. The Boai County Supply and Marketing Cooperative, in its work plan to serve the summer harvest and planting, first requires all grassroots cooperatives to do a good job in grain work, ensure stable grain prices and supply to grain-deficient households, and combine this with the completion of procurement plans; at the same time, it is necessary to do a good job in the supply of seeds, fertilizers, waterwheels, and small farm tools. They have formulated supply and procurement plans based on the needs of the masses and the local special products. Jia County held a commodity exchange fair in the urban area, with 80,000 people attending in three days. The trading of farm tools was brisk, and some farm tools were in short supply. The department store market was also very active, with many private merchants selling more than usual.
    In order to help farmers solve seed difficulties, the Central People's Government has allocated a summer planting seed loan of 50 billion yuan to Henan, along with 1.69 million jin of corn seeds. The Henan Provincial People's Government has promptly allocated these to various special districts, quickly lending them to farmers. (Henan Reporter Station)
    Xinhua News Agency: The People's Governments at all levels in Jiangsu Province lead the broad masses of farmers to actively struggle against natural disasters and strive for increased grain production. Now the province has timely completed the spring plowing and planting, and has begun harvesting wheat and transplanting rice.
    The cold wave in December last year and the late frost in April this year caused severe freezing damage to about half of the wheat fields in Jiangsu Province twice. After the disaster occurred, Party and government leadership organs at all levels dispatched a large number of cadres to the disaster areas to lead farmers in carrying out production and disaster relief work. Guan Wenwei, Vice Chairman of the Jiangsu Provincial People's Government, went to the heavily affected area of Huaiyin, pointed out the favorable conditions for overcoming natural disasters to cadres and farmers, explained the rational burden policy and the People's Government's disaster relief measures and determination, and encouraged the confidence of cadres and farmers in production and disaster relief. At the same time, the grain department transferred a large amount of grain, transporting it to the disaster area market day and night to stabilize grain prices. Since January, the People's Bank has successively issued loans of more than 654 billion yuan and relief funds of 60.4 billion yuan to help disaster victims carry out agricultural and sideline production. The trade departments and supply and marketing cooperatives actively opened up sales channels for farmers' local and sideline products. The cooperatives in four counties and cities in Xuzhou Prefecture purchased more than 300,000 reed mats, enabling disaster victims engaged in mat weaving to earn 3,000 to 5,000 yuan per day, appropriately solving their livelihood problems.
    Thanks to the many effective measures taken by the People's Government in Jiangsu Province in a timely manner, the farmers in the disaster areas have received great support both mentally and materially, and have actively taken action to rescue wheat seedlings. In areas that suffered from the cold wave in December last year, 40% of the affected wheat fields were replanted with new wheat in a timely manner. After the frost disaster in April this year, farmers immediately irrigated the seedlings and generally carried out processing and fertilization. Thanks to timely rescue, most of the lightly damaged wheat seedlings re-tillered and germinated, and headed and flowered. Wheat harvesting has now begun in various places. According to preliminary estimates, wheat yields in the areas north of the Yangtze River, which were severely affected, can still reach 40-50%; the SuzhOu and Songjiang prefectures south of the Yangtze River, which were less affected, will exceed last year's harvest.
    Not only has the spring plowing and planting work on more than 30 million mu of land in Jiangsu Province been completed in a timely manner, but it has also been done with more plowing and fertilizer application, and improved cultivation techniques. In Shuyang County, which has suffered from disasters for years, the amount of manure applied to the county's 1.6 million mu of spring fields this year increased by about 10% compared with last year. More than 60% of rice seeds in Wu County, Yixing, Zhenze, Jiangpu and other counties were selected using salt water. More than 90% of farmers in Jiangyin, Kunshan and other places have made qualified seedling nurseries, and the seedlings are generally growing well. After the rainfall in mid-May, single-cropping rice areas have begun transplanting rice seedlings. (Xinhua News Agency)

    人民政府领导农民和自然灾害作斗争获得成绩
    河南省部分地区开始收割小麦
    江苏省已完成春耕播种工作并开始收麦、插秧
    河南省各地的夏收夏种准备工作正在紧张进行中，部分地区已经开始收割小麦。
    河南小麦受到严重的霜灾以后，当地领导机关采取了各项有效措施大力领导农民进行浇麦保苗，收到显著成绩，全省小麦估计可保持六成三的收成；部分轻灾和未受霜灾地区，小麦产量还可超过去年。
    现在小麦即将成熟，五月二十日全省又普遍下雨，为争取麦季多收、收好和秋季丰收，各地农民积极进行夏收夏种的具体准备工作。获嘉县马应选农业生产合作社为合理使用劳动力和农具，组织了两个耕作队，按社员的技术专长具体分工，做到麦子随熟随割随上场，三天收完，保证不丢麦穗；并注意防风、防火、防盗，严防不法分子破坏；和麦收同时，做到所有秋季作物适时下种，力求增产粮食，长期备荒。去年全社秋季作物面积是一百一十八亩，今年计划少留垡旱麦地，扩大秋季作物面积到一百四十亩。收麦中除抽出八个人负责打场和管理菜园外，其余的人全部参加抗旱下种工作。
    洛阳六区佃庄乡杨天运互助组不断地向红蜘蛛、吸浆虫、霜灾、雾灾做了斗争，估计今年小麦不比去年减产。组员们紧张兴奋地开会研究了如何进行夏收夏种工作。全组两个木匠分工修理犁底、车梆、磙框，保证不误收割。他们还作了技术分工，全组男劳动力十一人，女劳动力十人，收割时普遍下地。麦子运到场时，组长杨天运领导男女十人负责碾麦打场，其余组员由副组长杨树敏领导一边割麦、一边犁地下种，保证适时下种，不留白地。
    郑州市郊区第五区受霜灾很轻，小麦一般比去年长得好。刘胡桐乡陈国干互助组实行劳力畜力合理分工，全组八亩红芒糙小麦一夜割完，第二天一早就种上了晚秋。陈留县今年小麦普遍丰收，估计比去年增产二三成。
    现在部分地区小麦已开始上市，上市量并日益增多。国营粮食、贸易部门和合作社，正抓紧时间开展业务，集中力量为夏收夏种服务。陈留县粮食公司已收购大麦和豌豆，并与合作社订立代购代销合同，收购小麦；同时准备了三十万斤黄豆种籽供应农民。博爱县供销合作社在为夏收夏种服务的工作计划中，首先要求各基层社作好粮食工作，保证粮价稳定和对缺粮户的供应，结合完成收购计划；同时要做好种籽、肥料、水车以及小件农具的供应工作。他们已根据群众需要量和当地土产品情况订出了供应和收购计划。郏县举行了城关物资交流会，三天赶会群众达八万人，会上农具交易畅快，部分农具供不应求，百货市场也十分活跃，很多私商卖钱额超过了平时。
    为帮助农民解决种籽困难，中央人民政府已拨给河南夏播种籽贷款五百亿元，玉米种籽一百六十九万斤。河南省人民政府已及时拨给各专区，迅速贷到农民手中。    （河南记者站）
    江苏省各级人民政府领导广大农民积极和自然灾害作斗争，争取粮食增产。现在全省已及时完成春耕春种，并开始收麦、插秧。
    去年十二月的寒流和今年四月的晚霜，使江苏全省约二分之一的麦田，遭受两次严重的冻害。灾情发生后，各地党、政领导机关都抽调大批干部深入灾区，领导农民进行生产救灾工作。江苏省人民政府副主席管文蔚到淮阴重灾区，向干部和农民指出战胜自然灾害的有利条件，讲解合理负担政策以及人民政府的救灾措施和决心，鼓舞干部和农民生产救灾的信心。同时，粮食部门调拨大批粮食，日夜赶运至灾区市场供应，稳定了粮价。人民银行从一月份起，已先后发出贷款六千五百四十多亿元，救济款六百零四亿元，帮助灾民进行农业和副业生产。贸易部门和供销合作社积极为农民的土产品和副业产品打开销路，徐州专区四个县市合作社收购芦席三十多万张，使进行编席生产的灾民，每天能获利三千到五千元，适当解决了生活上的困难问题。
    江苏省由于人民政府及时采取了许多有效的措施，灾区农民在精神上、物质上得到了极大支持，积极行动起来抢救麦苗。去年十二月遭受寒流袭击的地区，受害的麦田有百分之四十及时补种了新麦。今年四月发生霜灾后，农民又立即进行浇水救苗，并普遍进行加工施肥。由于及时抢救，受害轻的麦苗大部重新分蘖发芽，吐穗扬花。现在各地已开始收麦。据初步估计，受灾较重的长江以北地区，麦子还能收四五成；受灾较轻的长江以南苏州、松江两专区，将超过去年的收成。
    江苏省三千多万亩地的春耕春种工作，不但已经及时完成，而且做到多耕多垩，改进了耕作技术。连年受灾的沭阳县，今年全县一百六十万亩春田施粪肥量比去年增加百分之十左右。吴县、宜兴、震泽、江浦等县百分之六十以上的稻种采用了盐水选种。江阴、昆山等地百分之九十以上的农户做了合式秧池，秧苗普遍生长良好。五月中旬降雨后，单季水稻地区已开始插秧。    （新华社）
