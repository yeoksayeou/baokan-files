    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 10th. To shift the losses from business stagnation, the "Coal Mine Operators League," a Japanese coal mining capitalists' organization, is attempting to dismiss 70,000 coal miners under the pretext of "enterprise reorganization." This plan by the coal mining capitalists has immediately met with the resolute opposition of the workers.
    In response to this conspiracy by the capitalists, the Japanese Coal Miners' Union held a central executive committee meeting on May 29th and 30th, deciding to launch a struggle against the capitalists' plan to dismiss large numbers of workers, and put forward demands for improving the wage system, refusing overtime work, and strictly adhering to rest hours.
    The Japanese Coal Miners' Union has established a "Struggle Committee Against Enterprise Reorganization" to specifically lead the coal miners in the struggle against dismissal.

    日本煤矿工会决定展开斗争
    反对资本家企图解雇大批矿工
    【新华社十日讯】东京消息：为了转嫁营业萧条的损失，日本煤矿业资本家的组织“煤矿经营者联盟”企图以“整顿企业”为名，准备解雇七万名煤矿工人。煤矿业资本家的这个计划，立即遭到工人的坚决反对。
    日本煤矿工会针对资本家的这项阴谋计划，在五月二十九和三十日两天召开了中央执行委员会会议，决定对资本家大批解雇工人的计划展开斗争，并提出改善工资制度、拒绝加班工作和严格遵守休息时间等要求。
    日本煤矿工会已成立了一个“反对整顿企业斗争委员会”，来具体领导煤矿工人进行反对解雇的斗争。
