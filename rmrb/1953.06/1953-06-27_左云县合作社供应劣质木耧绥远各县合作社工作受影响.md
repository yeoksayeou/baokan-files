    Zuoyun County Cooperative Supplies Inferior Wooden Seed Drills, Affecting Work of Cooperatives in Suiyuan Counties

    Suiyuan Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative General Agency Gui Sui Supply Wholesale Station writes: At the Gui Sui Municipal Materials Exchange Conference on October 25th last year, the Zuoyun County Cooperative of Shanxi Province signed a contract with our station to supply wooden seed drills. The contract stipulated that the cooperative would supply our station with 2,500 single-seed drills and 1,000 mixed-seed drills, with delivery to be made in one batch in February of this year. Later, the cooperative sent someone to Gui Sui to request a postponement of the delivery date. This would add considerable difficulty to our work of allocating agricultural implements, but in order to accommodate the other party's production situation, we still agreed to postpone the full delivery of the goods until March 24th. However, by March 24th, the other party had not delivered a portion of the wooden seed drills; and even more seriously, the quality of the wooden seed drills that had been delivered was too poor to be used. After we allocated the wooden seed drills to various cooperatives, according to incomplete statistics, the joint cooperatives of only Taolin, Wudong, Zhuozi, Fengzhen and other seven counties had 928 drills stockpiled and unsold, and many farmers requested to return the wooden seed drills they had already purchased. The main problems with the wooden seed drills were that the wood was damp; after being exposed to the wind, the drill legs were uneven, the seeding was uneven, the drill legs were cracked, the drill hoppers were cracked, the drill legs and drill hoppers did not fit together, and the exterior was very rough. Some county joint cooperatives hired people to process the wooden seed drills themselves in order to make them saleable; but once exposed to the wind, the processed wooden seed drills all cracked again.

    The reason for this situation is mainly that the Zuoyun County Cooperative's business perspective is incorrect. It is understood that the cooperative had no preparation for the production of wooden seed drills beforehand, but boasted about it at the Materials Exchange Conference and contacted other units to sign supply contracts. After the contract was signed, although the cooperative began to send people to purchase raw materials and organize production, there was still no one specifically responsible for this work. It was not until we sent someone to urge the collection of wooden seed drills in February that the cooperative adopted a more active attitude. However, with the delivery date approaching, the cooperative rushed to produce using damp wood, simply pursuing quantity and disregarding quality, resulting in dire consequences.

    The Zuoyun County Cooperative's actions have not only caused our province's cooperatives to stockpile large amounts of funds due to unsold wooden seed drills; more seriously, it has affected our province's agricultural implement supply work and damaged the cooperative's credibility among farmers. We believe that the Zuoyun County Cooperative should examine and improve its work style, and should be responsible for the dire consequences caused by its actions.

### 左云县合作社供应劣质木耧绥远各县合作社工作受影响

专栏：读者来信摘要

    左云县合作社供应劣质木耧绥远各县合作社工作受影响
    绥远省供销合作总社归绥供应批发站来信：去年十月二十五日归绥市物资交流大会上，山西省左云县合作社与我站签订供应木耧合同一件。合同规定：该社供应我站分籽耧二千五百张、混籽耧一千张，在今年二月一次交货。后来该社派人来归绥，要求推后交货日期。这对我们调拨农具的工作将增加不少困难，但我们为了照顾对方生产情况，仍同意延迟至三月二十四日前把货全部交清。可是，到三月二十四日，对方还有一部分木耧没有交来；而更严重的是，已交来的木耧质量太次，不能使用。我们把木耧拨给各社后，根据不完全的统计，仅陶林、武东、卓资、丰镇等七个县联社，即积压九百二十八张卖不出去，还有很多农民要求将已买的木耧退回来。木耧的毛病主要是木料湿；经过风吹，耧腿不平，下籽不匀，耧腿裂缝，耧斗裂开，耧腿耧斗不合套，外面很不光滑。有些县联社为了使木耧能够售出，就自行雇人加工；但一经风吹，已经加工的木耧又都破裂。
    产生这一情况的原因，主要是左云县合作社经营观点不正确。据了解，该社事先对生产木耧毫无准备，就在物资交流会上大吹大擂，和别的单位接洽订立供应合同。合同签订后，该社虽开始派人采购原料，组织生产，但仍无专人负责这一工作。直到我们二月间派人催取木耧时，该社才采取了比较积极的态度。但交货日期已近，该社就以湿木料加工赶制，单纯追求数量，不顾质量，因而造成恶果。
    左云县合作社这种做法不但使我省各社因木耧卖不出去而积压大量资金；更严重的是影响了我省各社的农具供应工作，并使合作社在农民中的信誉受到损失。我们认为：左云县合作社应该检查和改进工作作风，并应对他们这种做法所造成的恶果负责。
