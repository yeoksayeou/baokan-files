    Anshan Iron and Steel's Large Rolling Mill Actively Prepares for Production
    [This newspaper dispatch] The entire staff of Anshan Iron and Steel Company's Large Rolling Mill is actively preparing to commence production after the completion of basic construction. The Large Rolling Mill is one of Anshan Iron and Steel's major basic construction projects and is currently under intense construction by various engineering companies. This large-scale, automated rolling mill is designed according to the advanced Soviet rolling technology standards. When production begins in the future, both the rolling technology and organizational management will be complex. In order to prepare for a smooth start-up in the future, Anshan Iron and Steel Company selected outstanding technicians and skilled workers to study and intern in the Soviet Union last year. In July of last year, the Large Rolling Mill was established, and cadres, technicians, and workers were assigned to actively prepare for production. This included organizing everyone to participate in basic construction to become familiar with the machinery and equipment and the quality of the engineering; organizing technicians to study blueprints and materials and compile technical operating procedures, safety regulations, and duty regulations; running training classes to train workers; and preparing production tools and spare parts.
    In March of this year, during the anti-bureaucracy struggle, the Large Rolling Mill, in conjunction with the start-up preparation work, launched a mass inspection campaign, criticizing several erroneous ideas in the preparation work. Some people thought, "Basic construction won't be completed for a while, so we can take our time." Some cadres were clueless about the new automated factory, didn't investigate, were afraid of making mistakes, and were afraid of taking responsibility, so they were passive in their work. Some even thought, "There's nothing to prepare." Some comrades were enthusiastic, but didn't know where to start and were impatient. The inspection found that the main reasons for the slow progress of the preparation work were insufficient ideological leadership, poor planning, more general calls than specific arrangements, and insufficient inspection work. Through criticism and self-criticism, ideological understanding was unified, and all staff members clearly recognized the importance of completing the state's tasks and the importance of seizing the time to fully prepare for a smooth start-up.
    In order to better ensure the successful completion of the preparation work and welcome the start-up, in April, the Large Rolling Mill mobilized the masses to discuss the overall preparation plan, formulated preparation plans for each section, department, and office, and formulated individual guarantee plans and group covenants through mass discussion. The enthusiasm of all staff members for learning advanced experience is extremely high. Party committee, administrative, trade union, and Youth League cadres are learning from the experience of the May 3rd Factory. Technicians spend half an hour every noon teaching old workers to learn Russian and use their evenings to translate technical operating procedures, safety regulations, and duty regulations. A technical research meeting is also organized once a week to listen to lectures by Soviet experts.
    On May 22nd, the Large Rolling Mill's trade union held a general meeting of all staff members, and the administrative department approved the plans of each section, department, and office. At the meeting, each section, department, and office put forward challenge and response conditions to each other, and the chairman of the trade union proposed launching a patriotic red flag competition. All staff members unanimously expressed their determination to guarantee the completion of the preparation work plan ahead of schedule.

    鞍钢大型轧钢厂积极进行生产准备工作
    【本报讯】鞍山钢铁公司大型轧钢厂全体职工积极进行迎接基本建设竣工后开工生产的准备工作。大型轧钢厂是鞍钢巨大基本建设工程之一，现正由各工程公司紧张地进行施工。这个巨大规模的自动化轧钢厂，是以苏联先进轧钢技术标准进行设计的，将来开工生产，在轧钢技术与组织管理方面都很复杂。鞍山钢铁公司为了准备将来顺利开工，去年曾选派优秀技术员及熟练工人去苏联留学实习，并在去年七月成立大型轧钢厂，调配干部、技术人员及工人积极着手进行生产准备工作。如组织大家参加基本建设以便熟悉机械设备及工程质量情况；组织技术员学习图纸资料，编制技术操作规程、保安规程、职责条例等；开办训练班培养工人，以及准备生产工具、备品等项工作。
    今年三月，大型轧钢厂在反官僚主义斗争中，结合开工准备工作开展了群众性的检查工作，批判准备工作中几种错误思想。如有的人认为“基本建设一时还完不了工，可以慢慢来”。某些干部对于新式自动化工厂心中无数，不摸底，怕出错，怕负责，工作被动。甚至有人认为“没有什么好准备的”。又有些同志热情虽高，但不知从哪里着手准备，存在急躁情绪。在检查中找到了准备工作进度缓慢的主要原因：思想领导不够，工作计划性差，一般号召多于具体布置，检查工作做得不够。经过批评与自我批评，统一了思想认识，全体职工明确认识到完成国家任务的重要性，认识到抓紧时间充分做好准备工作是迎接顺利开工的关键。
    为了更好地保证准备工作的胜利完成，迎接开工，在四月份，大型轧钢厂发动群众讨论总的准备工作计划，制订了各工段及科、室的准备工作计划，并经群众讨论订出个人保证计划及小组公约。全体职工学习先进经验的情绪极高。党委、行政、工会、青年团干部正在学习五三工厂经验，技术员每天中午以半小时时间教老工人学俄文，并利用晚上时间翻译技术操作规程、保安规程、职责条例等，每星期还组织一次技术研究会，听苏联专家讲课。
    五月二十二日，大型轧钢厂工会召开全体职工大会，由行政方面批准各科、室、工段的计划。在大会上，各科、室、工段互相提出挑战、应战条件，并由工会主席提出展开爱国主义红旗竞赛，全体职工一致表示决心，保证提前完成准备工作计划。
