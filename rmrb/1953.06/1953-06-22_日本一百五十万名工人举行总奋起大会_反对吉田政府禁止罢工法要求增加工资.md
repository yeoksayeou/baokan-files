Xinhua News Agency, June 21st: Tokyo News: The nationwide struggle of the Japanese working class against the Yoshida government's anti-strike law began on the 20th. Under the auspices of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (commonly known as "Sohyo"), the largest trade union organization in Japan, a general uprising rally of workers against the anti-strike law and demanding wage increases and summer bonuses was held in various parts of Japan on the 20th. "Sohyo" announced that the number of workers participating in the general uprising rally across the country, including workshop meetings, totaled 1.5 million.

In Tokyo, the general uprising rally was held at Hibiya Park Plaza at 1:00 PM on the 20th. Approximately 60,000 members from 50 trade union units, mainly the Japan Electrical Industry Workers' Union and the Japan Coal Miners' Union, participated in the rally. Amidst a sea of flags, workers held up banners opposing the Yoshida government's anti-strike law and demanding wage increases. About 2,000 workers from the Akabane factory of Japan Steel Pipe Company, who are currently on strike, wore white headbands, expressing their determination to fight. The conference passed seven resolutions, expressing opposition to the anti-strike law and the new military buildup budget draft submitted by the Yoshida government to the Diet, opposition to accepting US "Mutual Security Agency Aid," opposition to US military bases, and the overthrow of the Yoshida Cabinet. After the meeting, the worker masses marched in columns on major streets in Tokyo in demonstration.

At the same time, Japanese trade union organizations decided to use strike action to oppose the Yoshida government's anti-strike law. At a national representatives meeting held on the 15th and 16th, the Japan Electrical Industry Workers' Union decided to implement strikes such as stopping power transmission and stopping power generation at any time from the 20th. At the Central Struggle Committee held on the 17th, the Japan Coal Miners' Union decided to conduct strikes at any time after the 20th.
