    Today is June 1st, International Children's Day. Our children are joyfully celebrating their own festival. We, the older generation, also seem to have become younger. We extend our heartfelt congratulations to the free and happy new generation of our country.
    The children of New China are the successors to the great revolutionary and construction cause of our people. Our Party and the People's Government deeply understand the serious significance of nurturing and educating the new generation, and have vigorously carried out mass-based maternal and child health work and children's health care and nursery work under possible conditions, and have achieved great results. In just a few years, we have reformed and trained more than 200,000 midwives, established more than 30,000 midwifery stations and health centers, and gradually promoted the new method of delivery among the broad masses of working women. We have carried out publicity and education on maternal and child health, and ensured the safety of mothers, infants, and young children on an ever-expanding scale. Various types of childcare organizations in factories, mines, government agencies, schools, streets, and the vast rural areas have developed rapidly; the quantity and quality of childcare workers have continued to expand and improve. Maternal and child health and childcare have gradually gained the trust of the masses and the attention of public opinion. Our primary school education has also made great progress and many improvements, with the number of children enrolled increasing greatly year by year, and their new moral qualities are growing. All of this shows that the peaceful and democratic New China, following the victorious progress of social reform and the continuous development of economic construction, is becoming a fertile ground for cultivating "flowers of life" more and more significantly year by year.
    Of course, as far as the current situation is concerned, our work in this area is still far from meeting actual needs. On a national scale, knowledge of maternal and child health and parenting is still very unpopular, and the development of childcare and nursery organizations is extremely uneven. Among the vast number of working women, many mothers have not yet adopted the new method of delivery, many mothers are unable to participate well in production, work, and study because they are burdened by children, and many children have not yet received more reasonable education. This situation requires relevant personnel in various regions to conduct more in-depth and detailed investigation and research work, and to vigorously carry out publicity and education through mass learning organizations such as people's schools, night schools, winter schools, and literacy classes, focusing on the living conditions, production conditions, and ideological conditions of working women, so that they can accept and master maternal and child health knowledge and parenting knowledge, and use practical examples to guide them to use mutual assistance and revolutionary methods to solve the contradictions between their production, work, and parenting tasks. Experience has proved that truly running a midwifery station or health center well and making significant achievements can attract the surrounding masses to automatically learn the new midwifery method and accept health knowledge; truly helping the masses run a busy farming season nursery or baby-holding group well can promote more masses to establish childcare organizations. Therefore, staff in these areas must constantly summarize experience, strengthen political and professional study, continuously improve their political enthusiasm and work ability, and diligently serve the masses and the new generation of New China.
    To cultivate the new generation of New China, we must not only protect the children's physical health, but also cultivate their noble moral qualities according to their physiological and psychological conditions, so that when they grow up, they can become builders of the new society and new life, and become strong fighters for socialism and communism. This is such a glorious and arduous task! This not only requires superior social conditions and the great efforts of educational workers, but also requires a high sense of responsibility from parents. Family education is an important part of children's education. Only with the close cooperation of parents and teachers can the role of children's education be fully utilized. A harmonious family atmosphere and the correct attitude of parents towards their children are necessary conditions for cultivating children's healthy thoughts and feelings. Some parents have not yet fulfilled their responsibilities well in this regard. Some parents completely push the responsibility of educating their children to teachers, some only pay attention to their children's food and warmth, but do not seriously consider how to effectively cultivate their good qualities, and some even habitually use rude attitudes of beating and scolding to treat their children. These are all erroneous ideological styles that parents in New China should not have. According to the opinion of the outstanding Soviet educator Krupskaya, the mother is a "born teacher," and her influence on her children, especially on young children, cannot but leave traces on the development of his or her entire personality and entire future. "People can educate their daughters to be slaves; they can educate them to be petty-bourgeois individualists, indifferent to the surrounding ever-changing life, and hold an attitude of aloofness to this life, that is, only focus on their own small circles; they can also educate a girl to be a collectivist, an active builder of socialism, a person who finds joy in friendly and cooperative labor, in the struggle to achieve great goals—a true communist." This passage from Krupskaya's article published in the eighth issue of the "Young Communist" magazine in 1935 (see the Chinese translation "Basic Problems of Communist Education") should become the motto of parents in New China. And one of the important tasks of childcare workers is to actively strive for the regular cooperation of parents.
    Among our childcare workers, many nursery workers, educators, and primary school teachers are not afraid of hardship, do not care about material treatment, and wholeheartedly serve the children, and have made great contributions to the noble cause of cultivating the new generation. However, some comrades have not yet deeply realized the importance of children's care and education, lack a high sense of honor and responsibility for their work, and even believe that doing this work has no prospect of development, so they are not at ease in their work. This is extremely undesirable. Educating children is a very delicate task, requiring great patience, neither letting them go their own way nor being too hasty, not paying attention to the limits that children can accept, and even more so not using any rude methods that affect children's physical and mental health to force children to obey, in order to replace the cultivation of their conscious discipline. True discipline cannot be cultivated by simple methods. Cultivating children's discipline should be combined with cultivating their initiative, strong will, and fortitude. Only children with such qualities and character can consciously abide by discipline and make abiding by discipline their own habit.
    In the process of cultivating children's new moral qualities and conscious discipline, parents and teachers should always be role models for children to learn from. The children's keen eyes are always watching you, and your every move and every smile will have a profound impact on them. If they see that you are dishonest, they will follow suit and learn hypocrisy; if they see that you are selfless, they will know that selfishness is wrong; if they see that you are extravagant, they will not easily understand that thrift is a virtue; if they see that you are not clean, they will not pay attention to hygiene. This is a very obvious principle. Parents or teachers should pay special attention to cultivating children's interest in labor and labor habits, and should often use their own exemplary actions to inspire their labor concepts and specifically guide them to carry out various appropriate labors according to their physical strength, intelligence, and interests. Love of labor is the most important quality that the people of New China must possess.
    Children need good role models and heroic deeds to inspire their noble and beautiful thoughts and feelings. Parents and teachers should use vivid and inspiring real-life materials to educate them. Writers should plan to write and translate excellent reading materials for them to expand their knowledge, enrich their spiritual lives, and cultivate their new qualities. There are too few good children's books in our country, and this work should be greatly strengthened to give children more and better spiritual food. This is an unshirkable responsibility of writers and painters in New China, and they should actively participate in the great work of "cultivating new human beings" as Gorky said.
    Under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, the people of our country, braving the enemy's artillery fire and overcoming countless difficulties, have opened up such a beautiful garden for the next generation. Let us use more effort to irrigate the "flowers of life."

### 更好地培养我们的新一代

    更好地培养我们的新一代
    今天是六一国际儿童节。我国儿童们正欢欣鼓舞地庆祝自己的节日。我们年长的一代，也仿佛变得更年青了。我们向自由幸福的我国的新一代表示衷心的祝贺。
    新中国的儿童是我国人民伟大的革命和建设事业的继承人。我们的党和人民政府深知抚育和教养新一代的严重意义，在可能的条件下，大力开展了群众性的妇婴卫生工作和儿童保健、保育工作，取得了巨大的成绩。在短短的几年中，我们改造和训练了二十多万接生员，建立了三万多个接生站和保健站等，在广大劳动妇女中逐渐推广了新法接生，进行了妇幼卫生的宣传教育工作，在日渐扩大的规模上保证了母亲和婴儿、幼儿的安全。工矿、机关、学校、街道和广大农村的各种类型的托儿组织，迅速发展；保育工作人员的数量和质量，不断扩大和提高。妇幼卫生和儿童保育事业，日渐取得了群众的信任和社会舆论的重视。我们的小学教育也有了很大的发展和不少的改进，入学儿童逐年大量增加，他们的新的道德品质正在成长。这一切说明了和平民主的新中国，跟着社会改革工作的胜利进行和经济建设事业的不断发展，一年比一年显著地成为培植“生命的花朵”的肥沃园地。
    自然，就目前的情况说，我们在这方面的工作，还远远赶不上实际的需要。就全国范围来说，妇婴卫生知识和育儿知识还很不普及，儿童保育事业与托儿组织的发展极不平衡。在广大的劳动妇女中，许多产妇还没有采用新接生法，许多母亲因受孩子拖累而不能很好地参加生产、工作和学习，许多儿童还没有受到比较合理的教养。这种情况要求各地有关工作人员更深入、更细致地进行调查研究工作，通过民校、夜校、冬学、识字班等群众性学习组织，针对劳动妇女的生活状况、生产状况和思想状况，大力进行宣传教育工作，使她们接受和掌握妇婴卫生常识和育儿常识，并用实际事例引导她们用互助方式和革命办法来解决自己的生产、工作和育儿任务的矛盾。经验证明：真正办好一个接生站或保健站，做出显著的成绩来，便能吸引周围群众自动学习新接生法，接受卫生常识；真正帮助群众办好一个农忙托儿所或抱娃娃组，便能推动更多群众来建立托儿组织。因此，这些方面的工作人员必须经常总结经验，加强政治和业务学习，不断提高自己的政治热情和工作能力，勤勤恳恳地为群众服务，为新中国的新一代服务。
    培养新中国的新一代，不但要保护孩子们的身体健康，而且要根据儿童的生理和心理条件，培养他们的高尚道德品质，使他们长大起来能够成为新社会、新生活的建设者，成为社会主义、共产主义的坚强战士。这是何等光荣而艰巨的工作！这不但需要优越的社会条件，需要保教工作者的绝大努力，而且需要家长们的高度责任感。家庭教育是儿童教育的重要组成部分，只有在家长和教师们的紧密合作下，才能充分发挥儿童教育的作用。家庭的和睦气氛和家长对待孩子的正确态度，都是培养儿童的健康思想感情的必要条件。有些家长在这一方面还没有很好地尽到自己的职责。有的家长把教育孩子的责任完全推给教师，有的仅仅注意孩子们的饱暖，而没有认真考虑如何有效地培养他们的优良品质，有的甚至惯用打骂的粗暴态度对待自己的孩子。这都是新中国的家长们不应该有的错误思想作风。根据苏联卓越的教育家克鲁普斯卡雅的意见，母亲是“天生的教师”，她对儿女的影响，尤其是对年幼的儿女的影响，在他或她的整个人格和整个前途的发展上，都不能不留下痕迹。“人们可以把自己的女儿教养成一个奴婢；可以把她教养成一个小资产阶级个人主义者，对周围瞬息万变的生活漠不关心，对这生活抱着隔岸观火的态度，即只是在自己小圈子里一味钻牛角尖；也可以把一个女孩教养成一个集体主义者，社会主义的积极建设者，在友爱合作的劳动中，在争取伟大目标的斗争中获得乐趣的人——真正的共产主义者。”克鲁普斯卡雅在发表于一九三五年第八期“少年共产主义者”杂志上的一篇文章里所说的这一段话（见中译本“共产主义教育基本问题”），应该成为新中国的家长们的座右铭。而保教工作人员的重要任务之一，也就是主动地争取家长们的经常合作。
    在我们的保教工作人员中，许多保育员、教养员和小学教师都不怕辛苦，不计较物质待遇，全心全意地为孩子们服务，在培养新生一代的崇高事业中有了很大的贡献。但也有些同志还没有深刻认识儿童保教工作的重要性，对自己的工作还缺乏高度的光荣感和责任感，甚至认为做这项工作没有发展前途，因而不安心工作。这是极不应该的。教育儿童是非常精细的工作，需要极大的耐心，既不应放任自流，也不应操之过急，不注意儿童能够接受的限度，更不应用影响儿童身心健康的任何粗暴方法来强迫孩子们服从，以代替他们的自觉纪律的培养。真正的纪律性，决不是用简单的方法能够培养出来的。培养孩子们的纪律性，应该和培养他们的主动性、坚强的意志和刚毅的性格等结合起来。只有具备这样的品质和性格的儿童，才能自觉地遵守纪律，才能使遵守纪律成为他们自己的习惯。
    在培养儿童的新道德品质和自觉纪律的过程中，家长们和教师们应该经常成为儿童学习的榜样。儿童们的敏锐的眼睛时刻注视着你，你的一举一动，一颦一笑，都会给他们以深刻的影响。看见你们不老实，他们就跟着学习虚伪；看见你们大公无私，他们就知道自私自利是不对的；看见你们铺张浪费，他们就不易理解节约是美德；看见你们不爱清洁，他们也不讲究卫生了。这是很明显的道理。做家长或教师的特别要注意培养孩子们的劳动兴趣和劳动习惯，应该经常用自己的模范行动来启发他们的劳动观念，根据他们的体力、智力和兴趣，具体指导他们进行各种适当的劳作。热爱劳动是新中国的人民必须具备的最重要的品质。
    儿童们需要良好的榜样，需要英雄模范事迹来激发他们高尚优美的思想感情。家长们和教师们应该运用生动的、能够鼓舞儿童上进的现实材料来教育他们。作家们应该有计划地为他们编写和翻译优秀的读物，以扩大他们的知识范围，丰富他们的精神生活，培养他们新的品质。我国好的儿童读物太不够了，应该大大加强这方面的工作，给孩子们更多更好的精神食粮。这是新中国的作家们和画家们不可推卸的责任，他们应该踊跃参加高尔基所说的“培养新的人类”的伟大工作。
    我国人民在毛主席和共产党的领导下，冒着敌人的炮火，克服了无比的艰难，为下一代开辟了如此美好的园地。让我们用更多的心血来灌溉“生命的花朵”吧。
