    Economic Achievements of the Bulgarian People
    By Guo Lubelev (Soviet Union)
    The Bulgarian people are confidently advancing along the road to a new life, developing industry, transforming agriculture, and improving their material welfare.
    The communiqué recently published by the State Planning Committee of the Council of Ministers of the People's Republic of Bulgaria and the Central Statistical Bureau on the results of the implementation of the First Five-Year National Economic Plan (1949-1953) is a remarkable illustration of the achievements of the Bulgarian people. Thanks to the selfless labor of the people, Bulgaria has basically completed its Five-Year Plan in four years.
    "The results of the completion of the First Five-Year Plan for the development of our national economy," wrote the Bulgarian newspaper "Rabotnichesko Delo," "show that our people have achieved great success in building socialism and have laid a solid foundation for the further development of productive forces and the more rapid improvement of the material and cultural welfare of the working people. These achievements of ours evoke a sense of pride in the heart of every Bulgarian patriot."
          ★  ★  ★
    In the past, Bulgaria was a backward agricultural country. After being liberated from fascist enslavement by the Soviet army, the Bulgarian working people, under the leadership of the Communist Party, overthrew the anti-people monarchical fascist system and established a people's regime. The people's democratic system has created favorable conditions for the development of the country's productive forces, for eliminating the centuries-old technical and economic backwardness, and the harmful rule of foreign imperialism and the Bulgarian bourgeoisie.
    As early as 1946, at the initiative of the Bulgarian Communist Party, it was decided to begin implementing the national economic plan. The two-year national economic plan for 1947-1948 has been successfully completed.
    The fundamental social reforms, the nationalization of industry, banks, foreign trade, domestic wholesale trade, etc., and the elimination of reactionary forces have established the necessary conditions for Bulgaria's smooth development on the road to socialism.
    At the Fifth Congress of the Bulgarian Communist Party in December 1948, a resolution was adopted on the First Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy.
    "In the First Five-Year Plan," Comrade Dimitrov pointed out, "we can set ourselves the task of laying the foundations of socialism, whether in industry or in agriculture. The First Five-Year National Economic Plan will solve this task. On the basis of this plan, in the immediately following Second and Third Five-Year Plans, the socialist edifice itself will be built, a socialist society will be established."
    The Five-Year Plan stipulates that productive forces should be rapidly developed by means of electrification and industrialization, and that new industrial sectors that Bulgaria had never had before should be established.
    The Bulgarian working people accepted the First Five-Year Plan as a combat action program and enthusiastically set about implementing it. Mass labor competitions and movements to master and apply the advanced experience of the Soviet Union were launched throughout the country. More than three-quarters of the workers in the country were involved in the labor competition. Thousands of advanced workers and production innovators emerged from the ranks of the working class and the working peasants. They are opening the way for everything new and advanced.
    "The people's democratic system," Rabotnichesko Delo pointed out, "has aroused the active creativity of millions of urban and rural workers, giving them the conviction that they are the masters of their destiny and the creators of a new life. New figures have emerged from the ranks of our working class, working peasants, and people's intellectuals, who, inspired by such achievements as were never available or even possible under capitalism, have participated in the cause of peaceful, constructive labor for the benefit and happiness of the people."
    During the years of the First Five-Year Plan, the first socialist labor heroes emerged in Bulgaria. They were cultivated and tempered in the new construction projects, in the boiling labor in the factories, and in the fields of agricultural production cooperatives. Now, the names of these advanced workers are even known abroad: Ferdo Stoimenova, Alexandra Langilova, Todora Stoichkova, Yelishavete Schifanova, Benyu Gencheva, Atanaski Dimitrov and others.
          ★  ★  ★
    Bulgaria's First Five-Year Plan was a year of large-scale industrial construction.
    Within four years of the Five-Year Plan, more than 700 industrial units have been built, expanded, and put into operation in Bulgaria. Among the newly built enterprises are the Stalin Chemical Plant, the large power stations named after Stalin and Chervenkov, and the "Republic" and "Dimitrov" power stations, as well as pulp mills, electrical machinery factories, and so on.
    Due to the commissioning of new factories and the reconstruction of old enterprises, Bulgaria's industrial production has greatly increased. The Five-Year Plan stipulates that industrial production in 1953 should increase by 1.2 times compared with 1948, and by 2.8 times compared with the pre-war year 1939. In fact, in 1952 - the fourth year of the Five-Year Plan - even without including local and cooperative industries, industrial production had increased by 2.4 times compared with 1948, and was equal to 4.3 times the 1939 level.
    The newspaper pointed out that during the Five-Year Plan, Bulgaria's machine manufacturing industry has made great achievements. In 1952 alone, machine manufacturing factories manufactured more than 130 kinds of complex machines and lathes. Bulgaria had not produced these things in the past. Now, in addition to tractors and self-propelled combine harvesters, Bulgaria is able to produce all types of agricultural machinery.
    Coal and mining industries have been greatly mechanized. Soviet machines, including coal mining combines, have been widely used in Bulgaria's coal mining industry. In 1952, 64.5 percent of coal mining work was mechanized, and 91.5 percent of coal transportation work was mechanized. Bulgarian miners have adopted highly productive Soviet labor methods. All this has ensured the growth of the coal mining industry. Compared with 1948, coal production increased by 73.7 percent, greatly exceeding the tasks stipulated in the plan.
    Electricity production has also increased greatly. Electricity production in 1952 increased by 1.5 times compared with the 1948 level. The "Republic" power station, which was put into operation last year alone, generates more electricity than all the old Bulgarian power stations combined.
    "Following the time-tested road of the Soviet people, following the road pointed out by the great teachers of the working people, Lenin and Stalin - which is now the road taken by all people's democratic countries," Rabotnichesko Delo said, "our people are victoriously solving the task of national industrialization, transforming it from a backward agricultural country with only primitive small-scale farming into a country with developed national industry and extensive cooperative and mechanized agriculture. They are building a solid foundation for the continuous growth of the people's welfare."
        ★  ★  ★
    Bulgarian newspapers and periodicals point out that Bulgaria has basically solved the food problem. Having personally experienced the superiority of collective farming, the majority of poor and middle peasants have joined agricultural production cooperatives on a completely voluntary basis. By the end of 1952, the number of agricultural production cooperatives had reached 2,747. They account for 60.5 percent of all cultivated land.
    Due to extensive economic ties with the Soviet Union, Bulgaria has greatly improved the technical equipment of agriculture. 140 state-owned machine tractor stations have been established in Bulgaria, owning more than 12,000 tractors and more than 1,300 combine harvesters. In the past year, almost half of all field work has been mechanized.
    Bulgarian newspapers and periodicals point out that all these measures have increased the yield of grain and industrial crops, and at the same time, the income of working peasants has also increased. In 1952, the average wheat yield of agricultural production cooperatives was 12.6 percent higher than that of individual farming. The total harvest in 1952 was even more than the production level stipulated for 1953 in the Five-Year Plan.
    Bulgarian newspapers and periodicals point out that during the Five-Year Plan period, the material and cultural living standards of the Bulgarian people have also improved. There is no unemployment in the country. Due to the development of all sectors of the national economy, the number of workers and staff has increased by 333,000. The continuous increase in national income has greatly increased the allocation of funds for the social and cultural needs of the working people. The state implements free medical assistance to the people.
    All sectors of the national economy have developed. Due to the increase in the production of various consumer goods and the achievements in agricultural development, it is possible to completely abolish the rationing system. In 1952, Bulgaria twice reduced the state retail prices of industrial products and food. The average annual actual wage of industrial workers increased by 38 percent compared with 1939. The income of working peasants also increased year by year, commodity circulation also expanded smoothly, and state-owned and cooperative trade accounted for 99.3 percent of the total national trade.
    Bulgaria has extensively carried out cultural life construction and housing construction during the Five-Year Plan period. The People's Assembly, state organs, and enterprises have built 3.4 million square meters of housing in cities and villages.
    The network of primary, secondary, and higher education has also developed. The number of specialized personnel with higher education in the national economic sectors is now almost four times that of pre-war, and the number of students studying in secondary vocational schools is five times that of pre-war. Scientific research activities have also expanded. In 1939, the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences did not have a scientific research institute, but now the Academy of Sciences has 31 scientific research institutes attached to it. The total number of scientific research institutes in Bulgaria has now reached 116.
    During the Five-Year Plan period, many new cinemas, theaters and opera houses, schools, hospitals, reading rooms and libraries have been opened in Bulgarian cities and villages.
    "Our small but heroic people are advancing forward with giant strides," wrote Agricultural Banner, "four whole years have quickly passed in the upsurge of enthusiastic construction, in peaceful constructive labor, new cities have been built in the wilderness, strong dams have been built in turbulent rivers. On the original sites of small workshops, modern factory buildings now stand tall. New railway lines have connected our industrial centers with the most remote areas."
           ★  ★  ★
    Bulgarian newspapers and periodicals point out that the Bulgarian people have been able to achieve such outstanding achievements due to the fraternal assistance of the Soviet Union and cooperation with various people's democratic countries.
    Bulgaria's foreign trade volume is growing year by year. According to the magazine New Bulgaria, in 1951, trade with the Soviet Union and the peaceful democratic camp countries accounted for 92 percent of Bulgaria's total foreign trade, while in 1937 it was only 10 percent.
    "The selfless labor of our people," said Comrade Chervenkov, "their concerted efforts to create the foundations of socialism have produced rich fruits, achieved achievements, and made our country develop like a socialist country. Our people are also like a socialist nation - because there is the existence of the Soviet Union and its powerful industrial might in the world, because the Soviet Union helps us, because the people's democratic countries that emerged due to its victory in the Second World War are united around the Soviet Union, we and they are carrying out fraternal cooperation, and helping each other."
    Under the leadership of the Communist Party, the Bulgarian people use their peaceful creative labor to ensure the development of their free motherland, and make important contributions to further strengthening the camp of democracy and socialism, and to the cause of peace.

    保加利亚人民的经济成就
    苏联  郭鲁别夫
    保加利亚人民正在满怀信心地沿着新生活的道路前进，正在发展工业，改造农业，并提高自己的物质福利。
    不久以前保加利亚人民共和国部长会议国家计划委员会与中央统计局所公布的关于第一个五年国民经济计划（一九四九—一九五三年）执行结果的公报，是保加利亚人民的成就的显著说明。由于人民的忘我劳动，保加利亚已在四年之内基本上完成了五年计划。
    “完成第一个发展我国国民经济的国家五年计划的结果，——保加利亚‘工人事业报’写道，——我国人民在建设社会主义中获得了巨大成就，并为进一步发展生产力与更迅速地增进劳动人民的物质与文化福利奠定了稳固的基础。我们的这些成就，在每一个保加利亚的爱国者的心里激起了自豪之感。”
          ★  ★  ★
    在过去，保加利亚是一个落后的农业国。在被苏联军队从法西斯奴役下解放以后，保加利亚劳动人民在共产党的领导之下，推翻了反人民的保皇法西斯制度，建立了人民政权。人民民主制度为本国生产力的发展，为消灭几世纪以来技术与经济的落后，外国帝国主义与保加利亚资产阶级有害的统治的恶果，创造了有利的条件。
    早在一九四六年时，在保加利亚共产党的倡议之下，就已决定开始实行国民经济计划。一九四七—一九四八年的两年国民经济计划已经胜利地完成了。
    由于实行了根本的社会改革，工业、银行、对外贸易、国内批发贸易等的国有化和消灭了反动势力，就建立了保加利亚向社会主义道路顺利发展的必要条件。
    在一九四八年十二月保加利亚共产党第五次代表大会上，通过了第一个发展国民经济的五年计划的决议。
    “在第一个五年计划里，——季米特洛夫同志指出——我们能够为自己提出这样的任务，即无论在工业或在农业中奠定社会主义的基础。第一个国家的五年国民经济计划，就要来解决这一任务。在这个计划的基础上，在紧接着的第二和第三个五年计划中，将要建立起社会主义大厦的本身，建立起社会主义社会来。”
    五年计划规定以电气化与工业化的方法来迅速发展生产力，并建立那些保加利亚从前所没有的新的工业部门。
    保加利亚劳动人民像接受战斗的行动纲领一样接受了第一个五年计划，并满怀热忱地着手实现这个计划。在全国各处展开了群众性的劳动竞赛和掌握与运用苏联先进经验的运动。卷入劳动竞赛的有全国四分之三以上的工人。在工人阶级与劳动农民中涌现出了数千名先进工作者和生产革新者。他们为一切新的和先进的事物开辟着道路。
    “人民民主制度——‘工人事业报’指出，——激起了数百万城乡劳动者的积极创造性，使他们产生了自己是命运的主人和新生活创造者的信念。新的人物从我国工人阶级、劳动农民与人民知识分子的队伍中间产生了出来，他们受了这种在资本主义条件下所未有、也不可能有的成绩的鼓舞，参加了为人民的利益与幸福而进行的和平的建设性劳动的事业。
    就在第一个五年计划的年代里，保加利亚国内便涌现了第一批的社会主义劳动英雄。他们是在新的建设工程中，在工厂里的沸腾的劳动中，在农业生产合作社的田野上培养与锻炼出来的。现在，这些先进工人的名字甚至在国外也是闻名的：费尔多·斯托依缅诺娃，亚历山得拉·兰吉洛娃，托多拉·斯托依其科娃，叶利沙维台·斯契方诺伏依，边纽·根切娃，阿塔纳斯基·季米特洛伏依等人。
          ★  ★  ★
    保加利亚的第一个五年计划，是进行大规模工业建设的年份。
    在五年计划的四年内，在保加利亚建成、扩充与开工的，有七百多个工业单位。在新建成的企业中，有斯大林化学工厂、以斯大林和契尔文科夫为名的大电力站与“共和国”、“季米特洛夫”等大电力站，有纸浆工厂、电气机械工厂等等。
    由于新工厂的开工和旧有企业的重建，保加利亚的工业生产量是大大地增加了。五年计划规定，在一九五三年工业生产量要比一九四八年增加一点二倍，比战前一九三九年增加二点八倍。而实际上，在一九五二年——五年计划第四年时，即使不包括地方的和合作社的工业在内，工业生产量也已增为一九四八年的二点四倍，而等于一九三九年水平的四点三倍了。
    报纸指出，在五年计划期间，保加利亚的机器制造业获得了巨大的成就。仅在一九五二年一年内，机器制造工厂就制造出了一百三十种以上的复杂的机器与车床。这些东西保加利亚在过去是没有生产过的。现在，除了拖拉机与自动推进联合收割机以外，保加利亚已经能够生产一切类型的农业机器了。
    采煤与采矿工业是大大地机械化了。保加利亚的煤矿工业中广泛地采用了苏联机器，包括采煤康拜因机在内。在一九五二年内，采煤工作已有百分之六十四点五机械化了，而运煤工作则有百分之九十一点五机械化了。保加利亚矿工们采用了苏联高度生产的劳动方法。所有这些，保证了采煤工业的增长。与一九四八年比较，采煤量增加了百分之七十三点七，极大地超过了计划所规定的任务。
    电力产量也大大地增加了。一九五二年的电力产量比一九四八年的水平增加了一倍半。仅仅去年开工的一个“共和国”电力站就要比从前旧保加利亚所有电力站发更多的电力。
    “工人事业报”说：“遵循着苏联人民的久经考验的道路，遵循着劳动人民的伟大导师列宁与斯大林所指出的道路——也就是现今所有人民民主国家所走的道路”，“我国人民正在胜利地解决着国家工业化的任务，把它从一个只有原始的小农经济的落后的农业国家，转变成为一个国家工业发达的、拥有广泛合作化与机械化农业的国家。他们正在为人民福利的不断增长建设一个稳固的基础。”
        ★  ★  ★
    保加利亚报刊指出，保加利亚已经基本上解决了粮食问题。由于亲身体验到了集体耕作的优越性，大部分贫农和中农群众已在完全自愿的基础上参加了农业生产合作社。到一九五二年底，农业生产合作社的数目已经达到了二千七百四十七个。它们占有全部耕地的百分之六十点五。
    由于和苏联的广泛的经济联系，保加利亚已大大地改进了农业的技术装备。保加利亚国内已经成立了一百四十个国营机器拖拉机站，它们拥有一万二千多架拖拉机和一千三百多架联合收割机。在过去一年内，几乎所有田间工作的一半左右已经机械化了。
    保加利亚报刊指出，所有这些措施，使得谷物与技术作物的收获量提高了，同时，劳动农民的收入也增加了。在一九五二年内，农业生产合作社的小麦平均收获量较个体经营提高了百分之十二点六。一九五二年的总收获量较五年计划为一九五三年所规定的生产水平还要多。
    保加利亚报刊指出，在五年计划期内，保加利亚人民的物质与文化生活水平也提高了。国内已经没有失业现象。由于国民经济所有部门的发展，工人与职员的数目已经增加了三十三万三千人。国民收入的不断增加，使得用于劳动人民社会文化需要的拨款大大地增加了。国家对人民实行了免费的医疗帮助。
    所有的国民经济部门都有了发展。由于各种日用消费品产量的增加和农业发展的成就，就有可能来完全废除配给制。一九五二年保加利亚两次减低了工业品与食品的国家零售价格。产业工人的每年平均实际工资比一九三九年增加了百分之三十八。劳动农民的收入也一年比一年增加了，商品流通也顺利地扩展了，国营与合作社贸易已占全国贸易总量的百分之九十九点三。
    保加利亚在五年计划期间广泛地进行了文化生活的建设与住宅的建筑。人民议会、国家机关和企业在城市和乡村内建造了三百四十万平方公尺面积的住房。
    初等、中等与高等学校网也发展了。国民经济部门中曾经受过高等教育的专门人材，现在几乎比战前多了四倍，而在中等专业学校中就学的人数比战前多了五倍。科学研究的活动也扩大了。一九三九年保加利亚科学院还没有一个科学研究所，而现在科学院却附设有三十一个科学研究所。保加利亚国内科学研究所的总数现已达一百一十六个之多。
    在五年计划期内，保加利亚的城市和乡村中开设了许多新的电影院、戏剧与歌剧院、学校、医院、阅览室与图书馆。
    “我国人数不多的但是英勇的人民，以巨人般的步伐向前迈进，——‘农业旗帜报’这样写道——整整四年很快地在热烈的建设的高涨中，在和平的建设性劳动中过去了，在荒野上建起了新的城市，在湍激的河流中堵起了强有力的堤坝。在小小的作坊的原址上，现在已耸立起现代化工厂的楼房。新的铁路线已把我国的工业中心与最偏远的地区连接起来了。”
           ★  ★  ★
    保加利亚报刊指出，保加利亚人民之所以能够获得如此优异的成就，是由于苏联的兄弟般的帮助，以及与各人民民主国家之间的合作。
    保加利亚的对外贸易额一年比一年增长。据“新保加利亚”杂志称，在一九五一年，和苏联与和平民主阵营各国的贸易，已占保加利亚对外贸易总额的百分之九十二，而在一九三七年却只有百分之十。
    “我国人民的忘我劳动，——契尔文科夫同志说道，——他们为创建社会主义基础的齐心协力，已产生了丰富的果实，获得了成就，而使我国像一个社会主义国家那样地发展。我国人民，也像一个社会主义的民族那样——因为在世界上有苏联和它的强大工业威力的存在，因为有苏联帮助我们，因为在苏联周围团结着由于它在第二次世界大战中获得胜利而出现的各人民民主国家，我们和他们正进行着兄弟般的合作，正在互相帮助。”
    在共产党的领导之下，保加利亚人民以自己的和平创造性劳动来保证自由祖国的发展，并为进一步加强民主与社会主义阵营，为和平事业作出重要的贡献。
