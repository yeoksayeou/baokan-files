(Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 5th) Academician Ivan Bardin of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, a famous metallurgist, recently published an article in "Pravda" describing the remarkable achievements of the Soviet steel industry in the post-war years and future tasks.

Bardin said: Since 1940, the efficiency of Soviet blast furnaces has increased by an average of 35 percent, and open-hearth furnaces by 42 percent. In recent years, some steel factories have greatly exceeded their planned production capacity. In terms of automating the thermal regimes of blast furnaces and open-hearth furnaces, as early as 1951, 95 percent of pig iron and 87 percent of steel were smelted in furnaces using this system. In 1951, the mechanization and automatic adjustment of basic and auxiliary production processes increased labor productivity in pig iron and steelmaking workshops by 61 percent compared to 1940. In ironmaking, the Soviet Union has achieved great success in expanding blast furnace volume. Currently, more than half of the pig iron produced in the Soviet Union is smelted in blast furnaces with an effective volume of more than 1,000 cubic meters. In steelmaking, Soviet open-hearth furnace workers have surpassed other countries in shortening the steelmaking process and increasing furnace efficiency. In several Soviet smelting plants, production innovators in the steel industry have set world records in productivity. In recent years, the lifespan of open-hearth furnaces has been greatly extended due to the use of high-quality refractory materials and automated thermal regimes. Automatic adjustment devices are also widely used in steel rolling workshops. Currently, the work efficiency of Soviet steel rolling workshops is the highest in the world.

Bardin pointed out: The Soviet Union's Fifth Five-Year Plan stipulates that the increase in the production of pig iron, steel, and steel products in five years will exceed the total increase in ferrous metals during the three pre-war Five-Year Plans. This requires the steel industry to continuously improve labor productivity and better utilize production capacity on the basis of further improving technology and production organization. In the future, it is necessary to fundamentally improve raw material preparation and mineral processing work in order to further improve steel industry operations. Currently, the Soviet steel industry has begun to widely use ore sands with very low iron content. The achievements in magnetic separation, sintering, flotation, vibration, and other mineral processing processes are expected to become the most effective methods for expanding mineral resources and further improving smelting products. Expanding blast furnaces is an important factor in improving blast furnace production efficiency. According to statistics, building one large blast furnace is better than building two small blast furnaces because it not only saves 25 to 30 percent of the money but also reduces the number of workers managing the furnaces and lowers pig iron costs. In steelmaking, we should now shift from using 350-ton open-hearth furnaces to using 450-ton to 500-ton open-hearth furnaces. This can overcome the phenomenon that the production capacity of standard open-hearth furnaces has lagged behind the production capacity of steel rolling workshops in recent years. In steel rolling, it is necessary to manufacture steel rolling machines that can roll various types of steel in the future, and further implement automation and mechanization so that continuous steel rolling devices can perform high-speed steel rolling. In addition, the automation of furnace thermal regimes is also important in steel rolling workshops. Currently, the Soviet Union has stipulated that the steel production process in newly built large steel rolling workshops must be fully mechanized. The current task is to develop automatic adjustment, so that very few people can manage the machines that are working.

    战后苏联钢铁工业获卓越成就
    苏联轧钢车间的工作效率是全世界最高的
    【新华社五日讯】莫斯科消息：苏联科学院院士、著名冶金家伊凡·巴尔金，最近在“真理报”上发表文章，叙述苏联钢铁工业在战后年代中的卓越成就和今后的任务。
    巴尔金说：自从一九四○年以来，苏联高炉的效率平均提高了百分之三十五，平炉提高了百分之四十二。最近几年来，某些钢铁工厂已大大地超过了它们预定的生产能力。在使高炉和平炉热工制度自动化方面，早在一九五一年，就有百分之九十五的铣铁和百分之八十七的钢是在采用这种制度的炉内炼出的。在一九五一年，基本和辅助生产过程的机械化和自动调节，使铣铁车间和炼钢车间的劳动生产率比一九四○年提高了百分之六十一。在炼铁方面，苏联已在扩大高炉容积方面获得了很大的成就。目前苏联生产的铣铁有一半以上是在有效容积为一千多立方公尺的高炉中炼成的。在炼钢方面，苏联平炉工人在缩短炼钢过程和提高炉子的效率方面已超过其他国家。在苏联若干冶炼工厂中，炼钢工业的生产革新者已在生产率方面创造了世界纪录。最近几年中，由于采用了质量很高的耐火材料和自动化热工制度，平炉的寿命已大大延长。轧钢车间也在广泛地使用自动调节装置。目前苏联轧钢车间的工作效率是全世界最高的。
    巴尔金指出：苏联第五个五年计划规定，五年中铣铁、钢和钢材的增产量，将超过战前三个五年计划中黑色金属的总增产量。这要求钢铁工业在进一步改进技术和生产组织的基础上不断提高劳动生产率和更好地利用生产能力。今后必须根本改进准备原料和选矿工作，以进一步改进钢铁业的操作法。目前苏联钢铁工业已开始广泛地使用含铁量很小的矿砂。在磁选、烧结、浮游、震荡和其他选矿过程中获得的成就，预料会成为扩大矿源和进一步改进冶炼产品的最有效的方法。扩大高炉是提高高炉生产效率的重要因素。据统计，建造一个大的高炉胜过建造两个小高炉，因为这样不仅可以省钱百分之二十五至三十，而且可以减少管理炉子的工人，降低铣铁成本。在炼钢方面，现在应该从使用三百五十吨的平炉转向使用四百五十吨至五百吨的平炉。这样就可以克服近几年来标准平炉生产能力落后于轧钢车间生产能力的现象。在轧钢方面，今后必须制造出轧制各种类型的钢的轧钢机器，并进一步实行自动化和机械化，使连续轧钢装置可以进行高速轧钢。此外，炉子热工制度的自动化在轧钢车间也很重要。目前苏联已经规定，要使新建的巨大的轧钢车间的钢材生产过程全部机械化。现在的任务就是发展自动调节，这样就可以由极少的人管理正在工作着的机器了。
