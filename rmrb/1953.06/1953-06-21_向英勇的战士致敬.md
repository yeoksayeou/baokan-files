    Saluting the Brave Warriors
    Yuan Shuipai
    With my eyes closed, I see: an innocent couple, two ordinary Americans, their hands and feet bound to chairs… The forked tongue of the electric current flickers, licking at those two noble lives… The cowardly executioners dare not face their pure gaze, so they blindfold them. The murder is complete! The crime spreads throughout the world! Tearing off the last tattered piece of "civilization," declaring itself
  to be fascist,
    to be the most barbaric murderer,
      to be the mortal enemy of peace! With my eyes closed, I see: two children, one six years old, one ten years old, led by a stranger—the defense lawyer—entering the gloomy prison every month, to embrace and kiss their parents whom they have not seen for three years. "Don't let anything bad happen to our mom and dad!" I see their little hands struggling to write this sentence on paper; the sixty-five-year-old grandmother faints beside the children. Ignoring the angry protests from every corner of the Earth, the murderers, cloaked in the black robe of law, open their blood-stained mouths... With my eyes closed, I see: this group of vipers on Wall Street, heads huddled together,
  writhing,
    hissing:
  "They must die!
        For the sake of our munitions stocks; they must die!
        Because we fear the people,
                fear peace." With my eyes closed, I see: an innocent couple, ordinary American man and woman, steadfastly and solemnly walking to the execution platform, repelling the despicable attempts at coaxing them to surrender, overcoming any threats and death! Ethel Rosenberg, Julius Rosenberg, my respected and brave warriors! You are the glory and pride of the fighting American people. When the high walls of Sing Sing Prison collapse, I will see your giant statues smiling in the port of New York!

    向英勇的战士致敬
    袁水拍闭着眼，我就看见：一对无辜的夫妇，两个普通的美国人，手脚被绑在椅子上。……电流的叉形舌尖在闪动，舐向那两个高贵的生命……卑怯的刽子手不敢面对他们的纯洁的目光，蒙住了他们的双眼。谋杀告成了！罪行传遍世界！撕下了最后一块“文明”的破布片，宣告自己
  是法西斯，
    是最野蛮的杀人犯，
      是和平的死对头！闭着眼，我就看见：两个孩子，一个六岁，一个十岁，由一个陌生人——被告律师的手牵着，每个月走进阴森的死牢，去抱吻他们的别了三年的双亲。“别让我们的爸和妈遭到什么不幸吧！”我看见他们的小手艰难地在纸上写着这句话；六十五岁的老祖母昏倒在孩子们身边。不顾地球上每一个角落的愤怒抗议，披着法律的黑袍的谋杀者张开了他的血嘴……闭着眼，我就看见：华尔街的这群毒蛇，头和头聚拢一起，
  扭动着，
    嘶叫着：
  “他们必须死！
        为了我们的军火股票；他们必须死！
        为了我们害怕人民，
                害怕和平。”闭着眼，我就看见：一对无辜的夫妇，普通的美国男女，坚定地、庄严地走上刑台，打退了卑鄙的诱降，战胜了任何威胁和死亡！伊斯尔·罗森堡，朱利叶斯·罗森堡，我所尊敬的英勇的战士啊！你们是战斗的美国人民的光荣和骄傲，当新新监狱的高墙倒塌的时候，我将看见你们的巨像在纽约港口微笑！
