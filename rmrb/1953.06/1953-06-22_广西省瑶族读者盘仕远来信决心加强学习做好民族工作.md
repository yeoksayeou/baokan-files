Reader's Letters Abstract

    Guangxi Yao Reader Pan Shiyuan Writes a Letter Resolving to Strengthen Learning and Do a Good Job in Ethnic Work
    Pan Shiyuan of the Guangxi Ethnic Work Team writes: I am a member of the Yao people of Guangxi. Before liberation, my family always rented land from landlords, and most of our harvest was paid in rent. When autumn came, there was no food at home, so my father and mother had to go to the mountains to collect "mao chestnuts" and "herbs" to sell in the streets in exchange for some grain to cook porridge. The family didn't even have a quilt. The suffering of hunger and cold was endless.
       In 1949, Guangxi was liberated. We carried out land reform in our hometown, and we were emancipated. My family of six was allocated twelve piculs of rice paddy and a house, and our life immediately changed. Before, we couldn't eat a few meals with oil and salt a year, but now we can eat oil and salt almost every day. In 1950, I went to school; in 1951, the People's Government sent me to Guilin to study; later, I was recommended to study at Southern University. While studying at Southern University, we received the sincere care of the People's Government. Every semester, I received a set of uniforms and a set of clothing of my ethnic group. We ate very well, and received a stipend for pocket money every month. We often visited factories and various exhibitions in Guangzhou. I deeply felt the loveliness of our motherland and the greatness of the achievements of various construction works in recent years; I deeply felt the care of the Party and the People's Government for our minority people.
    After returning to the province, I joined the Guangxi Ethnic Work Team. The great leader of the Chinese people of all nationalities, Chairman Mao, and the Communist Party's education and cultivation of me have made me a cadre of the People's Government. In the future, I will intensify my studies, unite closely with the Han cadres, serve the people wholeheartedly, and do a good job in ethnic minority work. At present, we have studied the Election Law and policies related to the implementation of ethnic regional autonomy, and we will go down to work immediately. I will definitely work actively and dedicate my strength to doing a good job in ethnic regional autonomy and the general election in ethnic minority areas.

### 广西省瑶族读者盘仕远来信决心加强学习做好民族工作

专栏：读者来信摘要

    广西省瑶族读者盘仕远来信决心加强学习做好民族工作
    广西省民族工作队盘仕远来信：我是广西一个瑶族人民。解放以前，我家一直租种着地主的土地，一年的收成大部分都完了租。到了秋天家里没有饭吃，父亲和母亲只得到山上去采些“茅栗”和“草药”到街上去卖，换些粮食回来煮粥吃。一家没有一条被盖。挨饿受冻的苦说也说不完。
       一九四九年广西解放了。我们家乡实行了土地改革，我们翻了身。我家六口人，分得了十二挑谷子田和一座房子，生活马上变了样子。从前我们一年也吃不上几顿有油、有盐的饭菜，现在差不多每天都能吃到油、盐。一九五○年，我进了学校念书；一九五一年，人民政府把我送到桂林去学习；后来，又保送我到南方大学去学习。在南方大学学习时，我们受到人民政府的殷切关怀，每学期我都领到一套制服和一套本民族的服装。我们吃得很好，每月还可领到津贴零用。我们经常参观广州市的工厂和各种展览会。我深切感到我们祖国的可爱和几年来各种建设工作成就的伟大；深切感到党和人民政府对我们少数民族人民的关怀。
    回省后，我就参加广西省民族工作队工作。中国各民族人民伟大的领袖毛主席和共产党对我的教育培养，使我成了人民政府的一个干部。我今后要加紧学习，与汉族干部紧密团结，全心全意为人民服务，做好少数民族工作。目前我们已经学习了选举法和有关实行民族区域自治的政策，马上就要下去工作。我一定积极工作，为做好民族区域自治和少数民族地区的普选工作而献出自己的力量。
