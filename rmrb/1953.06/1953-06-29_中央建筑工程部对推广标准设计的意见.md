    Opinions of the Central Ministry of Construction Engineering on Promoting Standard Designs
    A letter from the General Office of the Central Ministry of Construction Engineering: The "Excerpts of Letters from Readers" column on April 18th published a letter from Sun Dingyi and four others regarding further promoting design standardization in basic construction. After research by our Ministry's Design Institute, it is believed that this suggestion is correct. Our Ministry's original Design Division had done some standard designs, which had a certain effect on construction; however, it did not pay enough attention to the issue of comprehensive standardization. After the institutional adjustment, our Ministry's Design Institute has attached importance to this work and has established a Standardization Section specifically for standardization design work. This work began in mid-April. Several standard designs for standard doors, windows, floor slabs, roof trusses, etc., designed in the past have been sorted out and are being exchanged with the Beijing Design Company (the opinions of the two units have not yet been unified); other various design drawings and unified detailed drawings (structure, equipment, construction) are also being initiated, but no relatively mature sets of products have yet been produced. It is now planned that after the design work comes to an end and the institute unified trial implementation is more mature, our ministry will convene relevant units to study and finalize a plan for promotion.

### 中央建筑工程部对推广标准设计的意见

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    中央建筑工程部对推广标准设计的意见
    中央建筑工程部办公厅来信：四月十八日“读者来信摘要”栏发表了孙定一等五人关于在基本建设中进一步推广设计标准化的建议信。经我部设计院研究，认为这个建议是正确的。我部原设计处虽曾作过一些标准设计，对施工也曾起了一定作用；但对全面标准化的问题还重视不够。经机构调整后，我部设计院已重视这一工作，并成立标准科专门从事标准化设计工作。这个工作已于四月中旬起展开，过去设计的标准门窗、楼板、屋架等数种标准设计已经整理出，正与北京市设计公司交换意见
    （两单位意见尚未统一）；其他各种设计图及统一详图（结构、设备、建筑）等亦正开始进行，尚未作出较成熟的成套的东西来。现拟在设计工作告一段落，就该院统一试行较成熟后，再由我部召集有关单位研究定案推广。
