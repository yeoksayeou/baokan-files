    Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 1st dispatch: East of the North Han River on the Korean Eastern Front is filled with the smoke of battle, and the struggle for "Square Hill" and the surrounding ridges continues. On May 30th alone, our army annihilated more than 300 enemies who came to counterattack.

    The enemy fires an average of more than 26,000 artillery shells at "Square Hill" and its surrounding hilltops every day, and enemy aircraft constantly bomb and strafe this area, coordinating with their companies and battalions of infantry in frantic counterattacks. However, they have all been severely hit by our army. The warriors of our army guarding the mountains report to the command every day: We have repelled the enemy's charge again!

    In the fierce battle, our artillery actively cooperated with the infantry to strike at the enemy who came to counterattack. Whenever the forward infantry sent out a signal requesting artillery support, piercing the thick smoke and flying into the sky, groups of shells would fall into the enemy ranks and explode in a timely manner. Later, the enemy released a large amount of smoke screen before each counterattack, but their attempt to shield the target of our artillery fire also failed. On the afternoon of May 30th, the enemy used two companies of troops to launch a counterattack on a hilltop from three directions under the cover of a smoke screen, but the most forward infantry of our army immediately used a walkie-talkie to notify the artillery of the specific location of the enemy, and immediately countless shells with whistling sounds exploded in the enemy ranks. A few minutes later, our infantry fired a signal from the smoke screen indicating that the enemy's charge had been defeated.

    From the night of May 27th, when our army launched a counterattack on "Square Hill" and nearby hills, to May 30th, our army had annihilated more than 1,300 enemy troops on and around "Square Hill".

    Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 1st dispatch: The senior command of a unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army recently issued a commendation to a night raid team on the Shangganling front that achieved remarkable results.

    This night raid team consisted of five squads. On the night of May 15th, with the coordination of artillery fire, they captured two enemy positions east and southeast of Hill 597.9 in one fell swoop, annihilating nearly 200 Rhee's (South Korean) troops.

    These two enemy positions are only more than 300 meters away from Hill 597.9 of our army. Among them, the "Little Red Hill" position has been attacked by our army six times in just four months from January to April this year, and more than 300 enemy troops have been annihilated successively.

    On the night of the 15th, three squads of our army's night raid team, under the cover of artillery fire, took three minutes to capture the forward positions of these two enemy positions, and then inserted into the center of the enemy's position, launching a fierce close combat with the enemy entrenched in the traffic trenches and hidden bunkers. Combat squad leader Wang Shifu and soldier Zhang Hengju first attacked the enemy's company headquarters, killing the enemy company commander, and then eliminating several enemies in the bunkers. When the two squads led by Xie Kun, the deputy company commander of our army, rushed over eight barbed wire fences from the flanks of the enemy's position and waded through a river ditch waist-deep to attack the mountain, the enemy was already in chaos, but more than 30 enemies were still stubbornly resisting in two large bunkers. Our soldiers Chen Yongqing and Yang Chunlin threw several grenades, destroying these enemies and the two large bunkers together. The final investigation revealed that our army completely annihilated a company and two other platoons of the 28th Regiment of the 9th Division of the Rhee's (South Korean) army, nearly 200 men, on these two positions.

    我军在北汉江以东已歼敌一千三百多名
    志愿军某部通令表扬上甘岭前线一支夜袭队
    【新华社朝鲜前线一日电】朝鲜东线北汉江以东整日烟火腾腾，“方形山”及其周围的山岭的争夺战仍在继续进行。五月三十日一天，我军又歼灭前来反扑的敌人三百多名。
    敌人平均每天向“方形山”及其周围山头发射炮弹两万六千多发，敌机也不停地向这一带山头进行轰炸和扫射，配合他们成连成营的步兵进行疯狂反扑，但是，他们都遭到了我军沉重的打击。守卫在山上的我军勇士们每天都向指挥机关报告说：我们又打退了敌人的冲锋！
    在激烈的战斗中，我军炮兵积极配合步兵打击前来反扑的敌人。每当前沿步兵发出要求炮火支援的讯号穿透浓厚的烟雾飞上高空时，成群的炮弹便适时地落在敌群中爆炸。以后，敌人每次反扑前都放出大量烟幕，但是他们这个遮蔽我军炮兵射击目标的企图也失败了。五月三十日下午，敌人以两个连的兵力在烟幕的掩护下从三方面向一个山头进行反扑，可是我军最前沿的步兵却马上用报话机将敌人所在的具体位置通知了炮兵，立即又是无数带着啸音的炮弹在敌群中爆炸了。几分钟后，我军步兵又从烟幕中打出了击溃敌人冲锋的讯号。
    从五月二十七日夜我军向“方形山”及其附近的山头发起反击时起，到五月三十日止，我军已在“方形山”及其周围山头上歼灭敌军一千三百多名。
    【新华社朝鲜前线一日电】中国人民志愿军某部高级指挥机关最近通令表扬上甘岭前线一支获得显著战绩的夜袭队。
    这支夜袭队由五个班组成。他们于五月十五日夜里在炮火配合下一举攻克了五九七点九高地以东和东南的两个敌军阵地，歼灭李伪军近二百人。
    这两个敌军阵地距我军五九七点九高地仅三百多公尺，其中“小红山”阵地，仅在今年一月至四月的四个月中，就遭到了我军六次袭击，敌军先后被歼三百多名。
    十五日夜里，我军夜袭队三个班在炮火掩护下以三分钟时间攻占了这两个敌军阵地的前沿工事，接着向敌人阵地中心插去，与据守在交通壕和暗地堡里的敌人展开激烈的近战。战斗组长王士福、战士张恒居两个人首先攻打敌人的连部，将敌军连长打死，接着又消灭了好几个地堡里的敌人。当我军副连长谢坤所带领的两个班从敌军阵地侧后冲过八道铁丝网，涉过水深及腰的河沟打上山来的时候，敌人已乱作一团，但还有三十多个敌人躲在两个大地堡里进行顽抗。我军战士陈永清，杨春林投去几个手雷，把这些敌人和两个大地堡一起消灭了。最后清查结果，我军在这两个阵地上全歼守敌李伪军第九师二十八团的一个连和另外的两个排，近二百名。
