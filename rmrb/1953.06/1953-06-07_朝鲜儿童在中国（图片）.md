Korean Children in China

    Responsible comrades from Party and government organizations in various locations frequently visit the Korean children living in our country, showing their love and care for these children who have lost their parents. When Che Bingzheng, Secretary of the CPC Beizhen County Committee of Liaoxi Province, and Fang Huanzhang, the County Head, visited the Korean children residing in the county, the innocent and lively children all ran out to greet them.

    The Chinese People's Delegation to Comfort Korean Children Living in China visited Korean children living in various parts of Northeast China starting on May 16th. The delegation brought a large number of gifts and distributed them to these children who are far from their hometowns due to war disasters. This is the scene when the head of the delegation, Kang Keqing, and others arrived at the Mangyongdae Elementary School in Jilin City, and were warmly welcomed by the Korean children.
    The caregivers at the nursery often accompany the children for walks in the countryside.
    The Korean children living in our country study according to the curriculum developed by the Ministry of Education of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
    These are Korean children at the nursery playing in the playground.
    A close friendship has been established between Korean and Chinese children. At a get-together at the Beizhen Experimental Complete Primary School, Korean children performed dances for the Chinese children. (Photo by Wang Yongxi, reporter for the Northeast Daily)
    The Korean children at the Mangyongdae Elementary School in Jilin City were particularly happy to receive letters of sympathy from students at the Beijing Yuying Elementary School.
    The third-grade Korean children at the Mangyongdae Elementary School in Jilin City wrote to the Korean People's Army during the celebration of the "June 1st" International Children's Day, reporting their happy life in China.
    The children eat nutritious food at every meal, and their weight generally increases by seven or eight kilograms in just six months.
    On Sundays, the Korean children living in Shanhaiguan visit the world-famous ancient Chinese building, the Great Wall.
    Every morning, they do "People's Health Exercises" to exercise their bodies.
    Korean children often travel to various places during their holidays. When they get tired from traveling, they stop to wash their hands in the clear stream.

    儿童们每顿吃的都是营养丰富的食物，仅仅在六个月中，他们的体重一般都增加了七、八公斤。
    星期日，住在山海关的朝鲜儿童们结队游览世界著名的我国古代建筑物——万里长城。
    每天早上起来，他们都要做“人民保健体操”来锻练身体。
