How Anshan Iron and Steel's Production Scheduling Organization Grew
Anshan Iron and Steel Company General Dispatch Room Acting Deputy Director Luo Han

I. A Difficult Beginning

When Anshan Iron and Steel (Angang) established its scheduling organization, it encountered many difficulties.

To ensure and adjust the production of various factories and mines, and to supervise the factories and mines to produce according to the required varieties, it was first necessary to have a set of accurate work plans as a guideline for scheduling work. However, when the company's production department was first established in early 1950 (the company's dispatch room was directly under the leadership of the production department), production was still somewhat blind, and scheduling work could only be a simple recording of production data. In order for the scheduling work to promptly and quickly solve the problems existing in production, there had to be a complete set of communication tools and production indicator charts. But at that time, apart from a few dial-up dedicated telephones, there were no charts of any kind.

The company stipulated that the administrative leadership of the factory and mine dispatch rooms belonged to the production sections of each factory and mine, and the business was uniformly led by the company dispatch room. It also stipulated a method of reporting production status through timed calls. However, some necessary and specific scheduling regulations had not been formulated. Without these regulations, it was impossible to carry out unified scheduling. Although the dispatch room was nominally given certain business powers, the actual issuance of scheduling orders still met with obstacles and did not go smoothly.

The understanding of the scheduling organization by leaders at all levels of factories and mines was also inconsistent. Some believed that scheduling was just "transmission," some believed that scheduling was just "recording," and individual factory directors refused to obey the scheduling. He did not accept the orders issued by the company dispatch room, saying, "Since it is the manager's order, let the manager talk to me." The company's dispatch personnel also harbored a sense of fear towards the factory directors, and dared not talk to them about problems.

More seriously, the dispatch personnel themselves were not at ease. Some believed that scheduling work was not promising and would only become "telephone experts" in the future. Some believed that scheduling work was a great responsibility, strenuous and thankless. Some believed that it was better to work on-site, learn skills, and still be able to get bonus wages. Some believed that since it was just a matter of making phone calls, there was no evidence and it didn't matter if things were done carelessly. Especially technical personnel, who believed that scheduling work was "detached from technology" and requested a change of job.

Anshan Iron and Steel's scheduling work was carried out in the process of overcoming these difficulties.

II. The Key Problem Lies Here

After the company leadership discovered the numerous difficulties encountered in scheduling work, they immediately set about solving them. First, they grasped two key issues. One was the factory and mine leaders' understanding of the scheduling work, and the other was why the scheduling personnel were not at ease in their work.

The reason why the factory and mine leaders' understanding of the scheduling work was not unified was that the company had not explained the reasons well to everyone before deciding to establish this organizational structure, and then issued a document setting a deadline for its establishment. As for why the scheduling organization should be established, what benefits would it bring, what exactly the scheduling work should do, and what unified commands and unified scheduling were, were not explained clearly.

There were two reasons why the scheduling personnel were not at ease in their work. On the one hand, the scheduling personnel bore a great responsibility. All kinds of production-related problems that occurred during their shift had to be handled by the scheduling personnel, but the scheduling personnel did not have a comprehensive understanding of the on-site situation and their technical skills were not high enough, so they sometimes felt caught in a dilemma and felt that they were "unable to cope" and "strenuous and thankless." On the other hand, the scheduling personnel lacked a correct assessment of the importance of this work, thinking that scheduling work was just listening to the telephone, and therefore underestimated scheduling work.

In order to solve these two key problems, the company manager repeatedly raised the importance of scheduling work and how to do scheduling work at every production cadre meeting he convened, and explained it in detail to the leading cadres of various factories and mines. He also personally inspected the scheduling work of major factories, and publicly praised and criticized good and bad examples. At the same time, the dispatch room was authorized to solve some time-sensitive problems, such as emergency vehicle dispatch, rescue liaison in the event of accidents, and power distribution. When scheduling personnel were carrying out scheduling operations, leading cadres would never easily change scheduling orders as long as there were no errors in principle, and they would often pay attention to handling general daily production work through the scheduling organization.

In the third quarter of 1950, the company re-adjusted the scheduling organization structure, changing the shifts to a four-shift system, so that the scheduling personnel who worked in three shifts could get a certain amount of rest time and more study time, and could go deep into the site to study. The scheduling command post was refitted, so that several factories could talk to each other at the same time, and small telephone conferences could be organized when necessary. At the same time, emphasis was also placed on the work of "how to establish the prestige of scheduling."

First, the leadership adopted the method of boldly letting go and encouraging scheduling personnel to resolutely deal with problems. If the scheduling personnel made mistakes in the process of handling problems, the leadership would be fully responsible externally, and internally, the scheduling personnel would be asked to conduct a review and summarize the lessons learned, and the leading cadres would help them analyze the situation. This method of training scheduling personnel was effective. If the scheduling personnel did not handle the problem properly, the leading cadres would take responsibility for him and help him analyze and summarize the situation, helping him to truly understand where the mistake was. In this way, after a mistake was made once, it would not be made again next time; at the same time, the scheduling personnel would also be able to understand how to avoid similar mistakes and gradually dare to deal with problems independently.

Secondly, the leadership also used other methods to establish the prestige of the scheduling personnel. In order to reverse the phenomenon of factory and mine leaders disobeying the company's scheduling commands and factory and mine dispatch rooms emphasizing factory and mine director's orders and resisting the company's scheduling orders, the company organized some small scheduling personnel meetings when necessary, summoning the company's scheduling personnel and the relevant scheduling personnel who violated the orders to reason together. Sometimes the factory director was also brought in. During the conversation, emphasis was placed on criticizing departmentalism. The company leadership emphasized the company's scheduling personnel's opinions as orders that could not be easily changed, and only allowed obedience, not disobedience. If there were errors in the scheduling order, the factory and mine dispatch room could request the company dispatch room to change the order, but before the company dispatch room had changed the issued order, the factory and mine dispatch room still had to work according to the original order. After several similar meetings, the prestige of scheduling was gradually established.

From actually going to the site to study, the scheduling personnel also began to change their understanding and views. When the scheduling personnel saw with their own eyes that the orders they issued had truly become the actual actions of thousands of people on the site, their confidence and sense of responsibility increased, and they also began to realize that scheduling work was a comprehensive technical work.

After the company's work plan was enriched and improved with the development of the production department's work, the principles and directions of scheduling work were further clarified. The past mistakes and shortcomings, such as scheduling personnel not being familiar with the overall business, not grasping the key points, not finding the weak links in production, changing the wrong steel grades, rolling the wrong specifications, using coking coal as fuel coal, and distributing fuel gas equally, were gradually corrected with the improvement of the scheduling personnel's ideological understanding and business ability and the improvement of scheduling work methods. This enabled the leading cadres to gradually get rid of administrativeism, and the phenomena of "seeking the manager for everything" and "factory directors having to do everything themselves" gradually decreased.

III. Assistance from Soviet Experts

From the beginning of the establishment of the scheduling organization at Anshan Iron and Steel, Soviet experts have been giving great care and assistance. At that time, the Soviet expert responsible for assisting the company in improving the scheduling organization was Comrade Jilin Qieyev.

Comrade Jilin Qieyev was very busy, but he still took the time to check the work in the company's dispatch room every day.

In the beginning, he first went to certain factories and mines to understand the operation of some equipment and production situation, and then went to the dispatch room to inquire about the work of the on-duty scheduling personnel. The questions he raised were very broad, but they all belonged to what scheduling work should pay attention to and master. After the questions were raised, the scheduling personnel were required to answer immediately, and they were not allowed to temporarily call the on-site dispatch room to inquire. If they could answer them, he would pat them on the shoulder and say "good" repeatedly; if they could not answer them or if they were evasive, he would criticize them on the spot without hesitation. This method of inspection worked very well. In order to answer his questions, the scheduler had to have a comprehensive understanding of the situation. Over time, he developed a habit of regularly understanding on-site production.

After the scheduling personnel were able to answer the questions about the production situation correctly and in a timely manner, Comrade Jilin Qieyev further helped the scheduling personnel to analyze the problems that occurred in production and guided the scheduling personnel to establish an overall point of view. For example, if the production of the ironmaking plant was abnormal, in addition to the reasons for the ironmaking operation itself, the fluctuations in the quality of sintered ore and coke were also an important factor. To ensure the quality of sintered ore and coke, it was also necessary to pay attention to the proportioning ratio and coal blending ratio, as well as the quality of the ore and the ash content of the incoming coal. The blast furnace gas used in the coking furnace should be ensured to be adequately supplied under any circumstances. After Comrade Jilin Qieyev explained these key issues related to various factories and mines to the scheduling personnel, the scheduling personnel were able to gradually understand why it was necessary to comprehensively analyze the situation when dealing with problems; and how to analyze the problems and conduct scheduling so that the orders would not deviate.

In addition, Comrade Jilin Qieyev also put forward many valuable opinions on how the scheduling organization should use indicator charts to supervise production. Because Anshan Iron and Steel has many factories and mines and complex products, it is necessary to systematically grasp the production of various factories and mines with emphasis, and indicator charts must be formulated according to the work plan and combined with the existing problems. Comrade Jilin Qieyev put forward the principle of attaching equal importance to output and quality, and supplemented and corrected the deviation of the scheduling personnel who neglected quality when preparing indicator charts. He added several items of the main product quality situation in the indicator charts, so that the scheduling work could more comprehensively take care of production.

IV. Expanding Achievements and Moving Forward Steadily

After going through a difficult road in 1950, the scheduling work of Anshan Iron and Steel gradually entered the right track.

In 1951, the dispatch room initially paid attention to mastering the quality problems of the company's main products and cooperated with the work of the technical supervision department. A scheduling order system was established within the company. When it was necessary to use unqualified raw materials in order not to affect production, the dispatch room could issue numbered scheduling orders and conduct reasonable payment through the inspection station of the technical supervision department. In July, the dispatch room implemented the practice of grasping the steelmaking situation of open hearth furnaces in steelmaking plants according to indicator charts. This chart was once used as the original record for the company's rewards and punishments for steelmaking production, and gradually developed into the ability to use indicator charts to grasp the production of various steel rolling plants. After August, power dispatch was gradually strengthened, the liaison with the Anshan Branch Power Dispatch Department of the Northeast Electric Power Bureau was truly established, and the transportation dispatch organization was strengthened. At the same time, the timed telephone reporting system between the manager and the factory directors began to be implemented, which further strengthened the connection between the company and the various factories and mines, saved many unnecessary document transmissions, and solved problems and checked work in a timely manner.

In 1952, in order to continue to strengthen the scheduling work, Anshan Iron and Steel successively determined several periodic meeting systems, such as the company-wide scheduling personnel meeting and the gas discipline inspection meeting. The former was for summarizing experience and promoting experience; the latter was for checking the implementation of gas scheduling discipline. In addition, power supply scheduling regulations were drafted, and the unified oxygen supply of the company was handed over to the dispatch room for reasonable distribution. In the second half of 1952, the company dispatch room organized manpower to rectify several relatively weak factory and mine scheduling organizations, such as gas, oxygen, mineral processing, and scrap iron plants, added personnel, and formulated some concise and useful indicator charts. Several new scheduling organizations were also established, such as the raw material scheduling room of the supply department, the cast pipe scheduling room, and the steel scheduling room of the marketing department. Therefore, the scheduling organization has become an indispensable and important link in the production management organization of Anshan Iron and Steel. The number of schedulers in the company has increased by one and a half times in three years.

V. Work Achievements and Current Problems

In the process of exploration and creation for more than three years, Anshan Iron and Steel's scheduling work has achieved some preliminary experiences and achievements from scratch.

1. Under the high-temperature operating conditions of several main factories of Anshan Iron and Steel, the scheduling staff is responsible for supervising and mastering the timely transportation of raw materials, relatively shortening the roasting time of molten iron and the soaking time of steel ingots, and shortening the production cycle.

2. The mutual cooperation and coordination between workshops and sections are closer than before. In the continuous production of various main factories and mines, due to the establishment of the system of timed reporting and timely reflecting the production situation by the scheduling organization, if a factory suddenly stops production in the entire production system (such as temporary maintenance of the sintering machine, such as abnormal production of the coking furnace), the situation can be timely reflected to the relevant factories through scheduling liaison, and effective measures (such as issuing materials, using reserves) can be taken in time to avoid the danger of insufficient raw material supply.

3. The scheduling telephone not only maintains regular contact with various factories and mines, but also maintains close contact with fire brigades, hospital emergency ambulance teams, and inside and outside factory motorcades. When an accident occurs, emergency deployment of rescue tools and organization of repair personnel can be carried out in time to handle the situation and reduce accident damage. At the same time, when an accident or failure is found in a certain production plant, the relevant plants are notified in time to pay attention. For example, in the event of a power outage, blast furnace shutdown, or insufficient water pressure, the dispatch room can grasp the situation in time, decide on the distribution quantity, and urge the factories to pay attention and prevent accidents.

4. Disputes between certain factories and mines can be resolved quickly and reasonably. This ensures the timely removal of production inconsistencies.

5. Major production events are reflected in a timely manner, prompting the leadership to pay attention to and solve them quickly. The leadership uses the data from the dispatch room to arrange the work for the day and study ways to overcome weak links, thereby avoiding the past shortcomings of being confused and disorganized.

There are still many problems existing in the scheduling work of Anshan Iron and Steel. The main ones are: 1. The organization method of scheduling work is still not satisfactory, and the workshop scheduling organization has not been improved. 2. The company still does not pay enough attention to the training of scheduling personnel. 3. The production of Anshan Iron and Steel is developing rapidly, and the business level of the scheduling personnel cannot keep up with the development needs. 4. The indicator charts are self-contained in each factory and have not been comprehensively unified, and the indication is not sufficient. 5. Some important factors in production cannot be controlled, such as the balanced arrival of cars from the railway bureau. 6. The scheduling tools and studio equipment are still poor. 7. The mining area is far away from the city, and the scheduling organization is not strong enough. These all need to be continuously improved in future practice.

    鞍钢的生产调度组织是怎样成长起来的
    鞍山钢铁公司总调度室代理副主任　罗汉
    一、困难的开端
    鞍钢在成立调度机构的时候，遇到了不少困难。
    要保证和调剂各厂矿的生产，要监督各厂矿按需要品种进行生产，首先就必须要求有一套准确的作业计划，作为调度工作的行动纲领。但一九五○年初公司生产处刚成立（公司调度室属生产处直接领导），当时的生产还有盲目性，调度工作也就只能单纯地作一些生产记录工作。要使得调度工作做到及时迅速地解决生产中存在的问题，必须有一套完善的通讯工具和生产指示图表。但当时除了有几台拨号的专用电话以外，什么图表也没有。
    公司规定了厂矿调度室的行政领导属于各厂矿生产科，业务则统一属公司调度室领导，也规定了定时通话汇报生产情况的办法。但是，一些必要的、具体的调度规程并没有制订出来。没有这些规程，就无法进行统一调度。虽然名义上赋予了调度室某些业务上的权力，但实际调度命令的下达，还是要打折扣、行不通。
    厂矿各级领导对调度组织的认识也不一致。有的认为调度就是“传达”，有的认为调度就是“记录”，个别厂矿长则不服从调度。公司调度室下达的命令他不接受，说“既然是经理的命令，就让经理和我讲吧”。公司调度人员对厂矿长也怀着一种畏惧的心理，不敢找厂矿长谈问题。
    更严重的，还是调度人员本身不安心。有的认为调度工作没出息，将来只好当“电话专家”。有的认为调度工作责任重大，费力不讨好。有的认为不如在现场工作好，学会了本领，还能拿超额奖金。有的认为，反正是打电话办事，说了无凭证，马马虎虎没关系。尤其是技术人员，认为调度工作“脱离技术”，要求调工作。
    鞍钢的调度工作，就是在克服这种种困难的过程中开展起来的。
    二、关键问题在这里
    公司领导方面发现调度工作中遇到的重重困难以后，马上着手解决。首先，抓住了两个关键问题。一个是厂矿领导对调度工作的认识问题，另一个便是调度人员为什么不安心工作的问题。
    厂矿领导对调度工作的认识不统一，原因是公司在确定建立这一组织机构前，没有很好向大家说明原由，便发下一纸公文，限期成立。至于为什么要成立调度组织机构，成立有什么好处，调度工作究竟要做些什么，什么是统一命令和统一调度，都讲得不明白。
    调度人员不安心工作，有两方面的原因。一方面是调度人员所负的责任重大，在值班时发生的有关生产上的各种问题，都要调度人员负责处理，但是调度人员对现场的全面情况不够了解，技术不高，有时弄得左右为难，就感到“吃不消”、“费力不讨好”。另一方面是调度人员对这一工作的重要性缺乏正确的估价，以为调度工作就是听电话，因而轻视调度工作。
    为了解决这两个关键问题，公司经理在每次召集的生产干部会议上，反复地提出了调度工作的重要性，及如何做调度工作等问题，向各厂矿领导干部详加说明。又亲自动手检查了主要厂的调度工作，通报表扬和批评好坏典型。同时，授权调度室负责解决一些有时间性的问题，如紧急时的车辆调度，发生事故时的抢救联络，动力的分配等。调度人员在执行调度业务时，只要原则上没有错误，领导干部决不轻易变更调度命令，并经常注意通过调度组织来处理一般日常生产工作。
       一九五○年第三季度，公司重新调整了调度组织机构，将班次改为四班制，使三班轮流工作的调度人员，能得到一定的休息时间和较多的学习时间，能深入到现场去学习。改装了调度司令台，做到几个厂能在同一时间内互相通话，必要时并可以组织小型的电话会议。同时，也着重进行了“如何树立调度威信”的工作。
    首先，领导方面采取了大胆放手，鼓励调度人员断然处理问题的办法。调度人员在处理问题当中发生了错误，对外由领导完全负责，对内则责成调度人员检讨并总结教训，领导干部帮助他进行分析。这种培养调度人员的方法是有效的。调度人员处理问题不得当，领导干部代他负责，为他进行分析总结，帮助他认识错误，使他真正了解到错误在哪里。这样，错误犯了一次以后，下次就不会再犯了；同时，调度人员也就能懂得如何去避免类似的错误，逐渐敢于独立地处理问题了。
    其次，领导方面也运用其他的方式，来树立调度人员的威信。为了扭转厂矿领导不服从公司调度指挥，及厂矿调度室强调厂矿长命令，对抗公司调度命令的现象，公司在必要时组织一些小型的调度人员会议，召集公司调度人员及有关违抗命令的调度人员到一起，进行评理说理。有时把厂长也找来。谈话中，着重批判本位主义观点。公司领导方面把公司调度人员的意见强调成为不可轻易变更的命令，只许服从，不许违抗。如果调度命令有错误，厂矿调度室可以请求公司调度室变更命令，但在公司调度室没有改变已发布的命令以前，厂矿调度室仍得按原来命令进行工作。经过多次类似这种形式的会议以后，调度威信也就逐步树立起来了。
    从实际下现场学习中，调度人员也开始改变了他们的认识和看法。当调度人员亲眼看到他们下达的命令真正变成现场千百人的实际行动时，信心和责任感增强了，也开始体会到调度工作是综合性的技术工作。
    当公司的作业计划随着生产处工作的开展而得到充实和改善以后，调度工作的原则和方向进一步明确了。过去的错误和缺点，如调度人员不熟悉全面业务，抓不住重点，找不到生产中的薄弱环节，改错了钢种，轧错了规格，把炼焦煤当成了燃料煤，平均分配燃气等等，都随着调度人员思想认识和业务能力的提高及调度工作方法的改善逐步得到了纠正。这就使得领导干部逐步摆脱了事务主义，“有事就找经理”，“厂矿长什么事都要亲自动手”的现象逐渐减少了。
       三、苏联专家的帮助
    从鞍钢开始建立调度组织，苏联专家就一直予以极大的关怀和帮助。当时，负责协助公司健全调度组织的苏联专家是吉林切也夫同志。
    吉林切也夫同志的工作很忙，但他每天都要抽出一定的时间到公司调度室检查工作。
    开始的时候，他首先到某些厂矿了解一部分设备运转和生产情况，然后到调度室来询问值班调度人员的工作。他提出的问题很广泛，但都是属于调度工作应该注意掌握的。问题提出以后，要求调度人员马上回答，不允许临时挂电话去询问现场调度室。能回答得出来的，他就拍拍肩头连声说好；回答不出来的或者是搪塞支吾的，他就毫不客气地当场批评。这样的检查方法很起作用，调度员为了要回答他的询问，必须做到全面了解情况。久而久之，便养成了一个经常了解现场生产的习惯。
    调度人员能做到即时正确地回答生产情况的询问以后，吉林切也夫同志就进一步帮助调度人员来分析生产上发生的问题，引导调度人员树立全面观点。如炼铁厂生产不正常，除了炼铁操作本身的原因外，烧结矿和焦炭质量的波动也是一个重要的因素。要保证烧结矿和焦炭的质量，又必须注意配料比和配煤比，也要注意到矿石质量和来煤灰份，而炼焦炉使用的高炉燃气，更应该保证在任何情况之下供应充足。吉林切也夫同志把这些有关各厂矿之间的联系关键问题向调度人员讲解以后，调度人员也就能逐步地明白了为什么处理问题时必须全面分析情况；如何分析问题进行调度，命令才不致有偏差。
    另外，吉林切也夫同志对调度组织如何利用指示图表监督生产，也提出了不少宝贵的意见。由于鞍钢的厂矿多，产品复杂，要有重点地有系统地掌握各厂矿生产，就必须根据作业计划，结合目前存在的问题来制订指示图表。吉林切也夫同志提出了产量质量并重的原则，补充和纠正了调度人员在编制指示图表时忽略质量的偏差，在指示图表中添加了几项主要产品质量情况的项目，使得调度工作能更全面地照顾生产。
       四、扩大成果，稳步前进
    鞍钢的调度工作，通过了一九五○年一段艰难的道路以后，逐渐步入了正轨。
    一九五一年，调度室初步注意了掌握全公司主要产品的质量问题，配合了技术监督处的工作。公司内部建立了调度命令制度，在必要时为了不影响生产而必得使用不合格的原材料时，调度室可以发布编号的调度命令，通过技术监督处检查站进行合理的支付。七月，调度室实行按指示图表掌握炼钢厂平炉出钢情况。这项图表曾作为公司奖惩炼钢生产的原始记录，并逐步发展成可以利用指示图表掌握轧钢各厂的生产。八月以后，又逐步加强了动力调度，确实建立起与东北电业局鞍山分局电力调度科的联络，并加强了运输调度机构。与此同时，开始实行经理与各厂长之间的定时电话汇报制度，使得公司与各厂矿之间的联系进一步密切了，并节省了许多不必要的公文传递，及时解决问题，及时检查工作。
    一九五二年内，鞍钢为了继续加强调度工作，先后确定了几种定期性的会议制度。如全公司调度人员会议，燃气纪律检查会议。前者是为了总结经验，推广经验；后者是为了检查燃气调度纪律的执行情况。另外，还拟订了供电调度规程，将全公司氧气统一交由调度室进行合理的分配。一九五二年下半年，公司调度室组织人力，整顿了几个比较薄弱的厂矿调度机构，如燃气、氧气、选矿、碎铁等厂，增添了人员，制订了一些简明合用的指示图表。又新建立了几个调度机构，如供应处的原料调度室，铸管调度室，推销处钢材调度室等。因此，调度组织已成为鞍钢生产管理机构中不可缺少的一个重要环节。全公司的调度员人数，在三年中增加了一倍半。
    五、工作的成绩和当前的问题
    鞍钢的调度工作，在三年多的摸索创建过程中，由无到有，已取得了一些初步的经验和成绩。
    1、在鞍钢几个主要厂的高温作业条件之下，调度工作人员负责监督，掌握了原料的及时输送，相对地缩短了铁水焙炼及钢锭的均热时间，缩短了生产周期。
    2、各车间工段相互配合与衔接较前密切。调度组织在连续生产的各主要厂矿中，由于有了定时汇报和及时反映生产情况的制度，因而在整个生产体系中如果发生了某一厂突然停止生产的现象（如烧结机临时检修，如炼焦炉生产不正常），通过调度联络，便能及时将情况反映到有关各厂，及时采取有效措施（如发料，动用贮备量）来避免原料供应不足的危险。
    3、调度电话不但与各厂矿经常取得联系，也与消防队、病院救急车队、厂内外汽车队保持密切联系。当发生事故时，可以紧急出动抢救工具和组织抢修人员，及时进行处理，减少事故损害。同时，在发现某一生产厂发生事故或故障时，及时通知有关厂注意。如停电、高炉休风、水压不够等情况，调度室都能及时掌握，决定分配数量，督促各厂注意，预防事故。
    4、某些厂矿间的纠纷，能得到迅速合理的解决。这样就能保证及时清除生产上的不协调现象。
    5、及时反映生产上的重大事件，促使领导方面注意迅速解决。领导方面根据调度室的资料，布置当日的工作，研究克服薄弱环节的办法，从而避免了过去心中无数忙乱纷纭的缺点。
    鞍钢调度工作中目前存在的问题还很多，主要的是：1、调度工作的组织方法尚不能令人满意，车间调度机构没有健全起来。2、公司对调度人员的培养仍不够重视。3、鞍钢的生产发展很快，调度人员的业务水平跟不上发展需要。4、指示图表各厂自成一套，没有全面统一起来，指示性不够。5、有些生产上的重要因素还不能控制，如铁路局车的平衡到达问题。6、调度工具及工作室设备仍差。7、矿山因远离市区，调度组织不够强大。这些都需要在今后的实践中不断改进。
