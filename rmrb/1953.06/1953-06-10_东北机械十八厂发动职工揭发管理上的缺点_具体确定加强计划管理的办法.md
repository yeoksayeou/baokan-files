The state-owned Northeast Machinery Plant No. 18 has begun to strengthen its planning management work and has launched a mass inspection movement throughout the plant to expose shortcomings in planning management.

Northeast Machinery Plant No. 18 began compiling work plans in the second half of last year, established production instruction charts for workshops, and implemented a warehouse parts control system, initially overcoming the chaotic production situation. However, due to insufficient understanding of the importance of work plans, record-keeping systems, and organized rhythmic production by leading cadres and workers, there were many shortcomings in the compilation and execution of work plans, which gradually became a mere formality. By March of this year, many workshops had even abandoned the formality of work plans, thus failing to achieve balanced production and fully accomplish the state plan. For example, the output of machine tools in the first quarter did not meet the state plan targets; the trial production of two 1Д62 Soviet-style lathes was delayed three times. This type of lathe was originally scheduled to begin mass production in the second quarter, but no groundwork or preparations had been made for various quotas, operating procedures, and tools.

After the First Ministry of Machine Building of the Central Government convened a factory director conference in March of this year, the plant's leading cadres clarified the important role of planning management and that the central link in strengthening planning management was to improve work plans and original records. Therefore, they immediately disseminated this information and organized cadres to study the resolutions of the First Ministry of Machine Building's factory director conference. At that time, cadres and workers generally believed that planning management had nothing to do with them, that the success or failure of planning management was the responsibility of the leading cadres and the planning and production departments, while the planning and production departments complained that others did not provide any data or implement the system. In response to this ideological situation, the leading cadres, on the one hand, reviewed their own shortcomings in neglecting work plans and original records and relaxing leadership over the departments; on the other hand, they cited examples to criticize the "it's not my business" mentality. As a result, many cadres began to examine their shortcomings and expose problems in connection with their own work. At this point, everyone felt that there were countless things to be done to strengthen planning management, and they did not know where to start or how to proceed. After careful research, the leadership came up with a plan for the entire plant's work in the second quarter, centered on strengthening planning management, requiring each department and workshop to develop their own specific implementation plans based on the plant's plan. At the same time, in order to further understand the problems in planning management, so as to find a basis for strengthening planning management, the plant also organized two specialized groups for work plans and original records, respectively, to go deep into the first and second mechanical workshops to focus on understanding the situation, and then convened a plant-wide meeting of recorders' representatives.

The information learned by the specialized groups and the recorders' representatives' meeting showed that there were many reasons why work plans and original plans were not well done, involving many systems, institutions, and personnel, and therefore could not be solved by a small number of cadres working behind closed doors. On May 11, the plant held a mobilization meeting for all employees, where the leading cadres explained the significance of strengthening planning management to all employees and the principle that everyone is responsible for doing a good job in planning management. On the first day after the mobilization meeting, many workers and grassroots cadres fully exposed various shortcomings in planning management, making the leading cadres realize that the key to the success or failure of strengthening planning management lies in the entire workforce, and that this task must be handed over to everyone to do well. Therefore, a mass inspection movement to expose shortcomings in work plans and original record-keeping was launched throughout the plant. This movement continued for ten days.

Workers in each workshop conducted serious self-examinations. For example, worker Xu Shanyong said: "Once the higher authorities assigned me two jobs, giving me three minutes for a four-hole job and five minutes for a two-hole job. I was really angry at the time. I thought: What are the leading cadres doing? Now I realize that if the plan is unreasonable, I am also responsible. The working hours I report are not accurate. I often average the work done in a day over eight hours. How can this enable the leaders to make accurate plans!" Worker Wang Dianhong said: "I do two kinds of work. One kind of work produces defective products, but it does not exceed the work-hour quota, and the other kind of work does not produce defective products, but it exceeds the work-hour quota. So I 'move the work hours,' moving the time for the defective work to the non-defective work, so I can get a quality bonus and save face. This kind of record-keeping is not accurate at all." Worker Zhao Chengcai said: "We also have a responsibility for not being able to achieve production 'rhythm.' We often produce defective products, and a task that can be completed in five days cannot be completed if we produce ten defective products. How can the next process achieve 'rhythm'!" Some workers also examined themselves for doing the easy work first and the difficult work last, which affected the implementation of the work plan; some also examined themselves for holding back and reporting work hours as less than they actually were or as more than they actually were, making the quotas inaccurate.

Many management cadres in departments and workshops also examined the shortcomings in their work. Zhang Yongxin, a planner in the first mechanical workshop, said: "In the past, when I made plans, I never considered the requirements of other workshops. The fitter workshop wanted to assemble on the tenth day, but we only processed on the twentieth day. There was no communication, so the plan was not practical." Recorder Tan Mingchuan said: "We are in charge of records, but we help workers 'move work hours.' We lack initiative. We record whatever the workers report, as long as no one comes to us." The main reasons for the failure to implement work plans examined by the departments and workshops were: the work plans were compiled based on the standard plans of last year, which were not in line with the actual situation; the plans of the workshops were not connected with each other; the responsibilities of the enforcers and planners were unclear, and they could not grasp the production situation. The main reasons for the inaccuracy of the original records were: the recorders were not familiar with the business and lacked initiative; the system was unsound and the procedures were chaotic; the working hours reported by the workers were inaccurate.

Through in-depth inspections from top to bottom, the reasons for the chaos in planning management were widely exposed, enabling all employees to have a deep understanding of the significance and urgency of strengthening planning management. Worker Liu Maoxiang said: "If the quotas are not accurate, the group plans will definitely be inaccurate, which will prevent the production of the workshop and the factory from being 'rhythmic,' and the tasks cannot be completed, thus affecting the entire state's plan. The relationship is really too big." Cong Qinggang, the leader of the fitter workshop group, signed a contract with the recorder to ensure that they would work together to improve the original records.

Based on the situation of the mass inspection, under the principle of steady progress, the plant's leadership has determined the steps and methods to improve planning management:

First, seize the current production tasks, mobilize the masses to study the construction procedures of the 1Д62 Soviet-style lathe, so that all workers can master the new product technology and meet the Soviet quality standards; second, mobilize workers to discuss the June work plan, determine advanced quotas, establish a dispatching system, and improve the relevant systems and institutions; and third, carry out key experiments on hourly record-keeping and promote them. Organize business studies for all cadres and strengthen the responsibility system.

    东北机械十八厂发动职工揭发管理上的缺点
    具体确定加强计划管理的办法
    国营东北机械十八厂开始加强计划管理工作，在全厂开展了揭发计划管理工作中缺点的群众性检查运动。
    东北机械十八厂于去年下半年开始编制作业计划，建立车间生产指示图表，实行仓库掌握零件制度，初步克服了生产中的混乱现象。但是，由于领导干部和职工群众对作业计划、记录制度和组织节奏生产的重要性认识不足，编制和执行作业计划的工作中有很多缺点，使作业计划逐渐流于形式。到今年三月，很多车间的作业计划甚至连形式也没有了，因而还不能做到均衡生产和全面完成国家计划。如第一季度机床产量没有完成国家计划指标；试造二台一Д六二苏式车床延期了三次，这种车床原计划第二季度就要开始大量生产的，但对各种定额、操作程序和工具等都没有摸底和做好准备。
    今年三月中央第一机械工业部召开厂长会议后，该厂领导干部明确了计划管理的重要作用以及加强计划管理的中心环节是搞好作业计划及原始记录，因此就立刻进行了传达，并组织干部学习第一机械工业部厂长会议的决议。当时各级干部和工人普遍认为计划管理与己无关，认为计划管理好坏是领导干部的责任，是计划科、生产科的责任，而计划科、生产科则埋怨别人不供给什么资料、不执行制度。针对这种思想情况，领导干部一方面在干部学习会上检讨了自己忽视作业计划、原始记录，放松对科室领导的缺点；一方面列举实例批判了与己无关的思想。由此，许多干部开始结合本身工作检查缺点，暴露问题。这时候大家感觉到的，就是加强计划管理千头万绪，不知从何着手，摸不着门路。领导方面经过周密研究，拿出了以加强计划管理为中心的第二季度全厂工作计划，要求各科室、车间根据全厂计划，订出各自的具体执行计划。同时，为了进一步摸清楚计划管理中的问题，以便为加强计划管理找到根据，该厂又组织了作业计划、原始记录两个专业小组，分别深入第一、二机械车间，重点了解情况，接着又召开了全厂记录员代表会议。
    专业小组和记录员代表会议了解的情况，说明作业计划和原始计划搞得不好的原因是多方面的，它牵涉到许多制度、机构和人员，因而不是少数干部关门研究所能解决得了的。五月十一日，该厂召开了全厂职工动员大会，领导干部向全体职工说明加强计划管理的意义，说明搞好计划管理人人有责的道理。在动员大会后第一天，许多工人和基层干部充分揭发计划管理的各方面缺点后，使领导干部明确了加强计划管理的成败关键在于全体职工群众，必须把这件事交给大家来做，才能做好。于是，在全厂展开了揭发作业计划、原始记录工作中缺点的群众性检查运动。这个运动连续进行了十天。
    各车间工人都严肃地进行自我检查。如工人徐善勇说：“有次上级布置我干两件活，四个眼的活给我三分钟，两个眼的活给我五分钟，我当时真冒火。我想：领导干部干的什么？现在我认识到计划订得不合理，自己也有责任，我报的工时就不准确，常常把一天干的活用八小时平均一下，这样怎么能使领导上订出准确的计划！”工人王殿洪说： “我干两种活，有一种活出废品了，没超过工时定额，另一种活没废，超过了工时定额，我就来个‘工时搬家’，把废活的时间搬到不废的活上去，既得了质量奖励，脸又好看，这样记录根本不能准确。”工人赵成财说：“生产‘节奏’不起来，我们也有责任，我们干活常出废品，明明五天能完成的任务，出了十个废活就不能完成了，下道工序怎么能‘节奏’！”有的工人还检查自己把好干的活先干、不好干的活后干，影响作业计划的贯彻；有的还检查自己为了留一手，把工时以少报多，或以多报少，使定额不能准确。
    许多科室、车间管理干部也检查了自己工作中的缺点。第一机械车间计划员张永信说：“过去我订计划从不考虑别车间的要求，钳工车间十日要装，而我们二十日才加工干，互不通气，计划就不切实际。”记录员谭明川说：“我们管记录，反而帮助工人‘工时搬家’。工作没有主动性，工人报多少就记多少，只要别人不找我就行了。”各科室、车间检查出作业计划不能贯彻的主要原因是：作业计划是根据去年订的标准计划编的，不切合实际情况；各车间订计划互不联系；执令员、计划员职责不明，不能掌握生产情况。原始记录不准确的主要原因是：记录员不熟悉业务、主动性差；制度不健全、手续混乱；工人报的工时不准确。
    经过从上到下深入的检查，广泛地揭发了计划管理混乱的原因，使全体职工对加强计划管理的意义和它的迫切性有了深刻认识。工人刘茂祥说：“定额不准确，小组计划也一定不准，这就会使车间和工厂生产不能‘节奏’，任务不能完成，因而影响到整个国家的计划。关系真太大了。”钳工车间丛庆刚小组长与记录员订了合同，保证与记录员共同搞好原始记录。
    根据群众检查的情况，在稳步前进的方针下，该厂领导方面已确定了改善计划管理的步骤和办法：
    一、抓紧当前生产任务，发动群众学习一Д六二苏式车床施工程序，使全体工人掌握新产品技术，达到苏联质量标准；二、发动工人讨论六月份作业计划，确定先进定额，建立调度制度，健全有关各种制度和机构；三、展开小时记录的重点试验，加以推广。组织全厂干部业务学习，加强责任制。
