The work of reducing workshop temperatures has been largely completed in national, locally-owned, joint state-private, and private textile enterprises across the country. The installation of a large number of cooling devices has now been basically completed. It is expected that the workshop temperatures in the vast majority of textile factories nationwide will meet the standards set by the Central Textile Industry Ministry this year. Over 740,000 textile workers across the country will enjoy pleasant production in relatively cool workshops this summer.

In textile enterprises, reducing workshop temperatures in the summer is an important measure to improve the labor conditions of textile factories, ensure the health and safety of workers, and an important link to guarantee output, improve quality, and reduce costs. To do a good job in cooling work, the Central Textile Industry Ministry convened the National Textile Cooling and Safety Conference in November last year, which discussed and approved this year's cooling standards and safety technical education system for various regions. In February of this year, training classes for ventilation and cooling cadres were held in Shanghai and Tianjin, and more than 130 billion yuan was allocated as cooling construction funds for state-owned textile factories nationwide. In March, the Central Textile Industry Ministry and the National Committee of the Textile Workers' Union of China issued a joint directive, requiring all bureaus and factories to basically complete the installation of cooling equipment before the end of June, strive to put them into use before the beginning of July, and require all regions to conduct a comprehensive inspection of cooling work in April. They also organized a special inspection team for safety and cooling, focusing on inspecting the safety and cooling preparation work in Shanghai and Central South China. Textile management agencies in major provinces and cities across the country have also done some work to implement the spirit of the Cooling and Safety Conference.

The East China Textile Administration Bureau has invested around 40 billion yuan in 25 of its affiliated state-owned textile, printing, and dyeing factories to focus on installing cooling equipment in the spinning and loom workshops, reducing workshop temperatures and basically eliminating the phenomenon of workers fainting in the workshops. This year, the bureau's investment in cooling equipment reached 56 billion yuan, accounting for more than one-half of the bureau's total investment in basic construction. The bureau has installed a total of 46 sets of large and small cold air equipment in 31 factories. Except for the state-owned Shanghai No. 18 Cotton Textile Factory, all state-owned cotton spinning workshops have installed cold air equipment this year. The Qingdao Textile Administration Bureau has invested 12.2 billion yuan in cooling equipment for its affiliated factories, adding four sets of cold air machines, 480 exhaust fans, and nearly 200 sets of spraying machines, blowers, spray heads, and other equipment to its affiliated cotton mills. In addition, many wells have been dug to make full use of the cold water in the wells to maximize the effect of the cold air machines. Over the past three years, the textile factories under the North China Textile Administration Bureau have installed a number of cooling devices. This year, the bureau invested another 21.2 billion yuan, adding six new air supply fans and planning to dig 14 wells, of which seven have been completed. The Northeast Textile Administration Bureau invested 33 billion yuan this year, and state-owned textile factories throughout the region added 28 new air supply fans, 199 ventilation fans, and nine new wells. It is expected that all of the above equipment will be completed and start supplying air by the beginning of July. The state-owned cotton mills in the Northwest have also installed a number of cooling devices this year, and the cooling installation projects in each factory will be completed by the beginning of July at the latest. Factories such as 610, 611, and 612 in the Southwest have generally installed insulation equipment on machine motors, and opened trenches next to the motors to install exhaust air ducts. The indoor temperature of textile workshops in factories in Central South China has been greatly reduced due to the installation of cooling equipment. The air supply fans in the workshop of the state-owned Wuhan No. 1 Cotton Mill can send 8,500 cubic inches of fresh air into the workshop per minute, ensuring that the workshop temperature does not exceed 93 degrees.

This year, joint state-private and private textile factories have also generally launched cooling work. The Jiangxi Jiujiang Joint State-Private Xingzhong Textile Mill has installed 28 Bunsen-type atomizers in the spinning workshop this year, and renovated the underground ventilation and broken-end cotton suction device ventilation tunnels to exhaust the heat generated by machines and motors. Eight new wells have been dug around the factory buildings, and four sets of Soviet-style small air supply fans have been used to wash the outdoor air with low-temperature water and transport cold air to the workshop to reduce the workshop temperature. The focus of the temperature reduction work at the Hangzhou Joint State-Private Hangjiang Yarn Factory in Hangzhou is the spinning workshop. There are seven specific measures, the largest of which is the installation of a cold air washing room. In addition, under the supervision of the government, the cooling equipment in the workshops of private textile factories in Suzhou, Wuxi, Hangzhou, Wuhan, and other cities has been considerably improved.

This year, the improvement of cooling equipment in textile factories across the country will greatly benefit the health of workers, reduce diseases, and increase production. Due to the preliminary improvement of cooling equipment in the workshop of the Zhejiang Hulin Silk Factory, the attendance rate in May has increased compared to the original plan, which is of great benefit to reducing yarn breakage and substandard cloth. After the state-owned Qingdao No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory adjusted the temperature and humidity of the workshop, the amount of substandard cloth and yarn breakage was greatly reduced, improving quality and increasing tending capabilities, creating favorable conditions for further promoting the Hao Jianxiu work method and the May 1st Weaving work method.

    全国各纺织厂降低车间温度工作基本完成
    七十余万纺织工人今夏将在比较凉爽的车间里愉快地进行生产
    今年全国各国营、地方国营、公私合营、私营纺织企业里都大力进行了降低车间温度的工作。现在，大量降温设备的装置工作已基本完成，预计今年全国绝大多数纺织厂的车间温度，都能达到中央纺织工业部规定的标准。全国七十四万纺织工人今夏将在比较凉爽的车间里愉快地进行生产。
    在纺织企业里，降低夏季车间温度工作，是改进纺织厂劳动条件、保障工人身体健康与安全的重要措施，也是保证产量、提高质量、降低成本的重要环节。为了作好降温工作，去年十一月间，中央纺织工业部就召开了全国纺织降温安全会议，讨论通过了各地区今年的降温标准和安全技术教育制度。今年二月又在上海、天津举办了通风降温干部训练班，并拨款一千三百多亿元，作为全国国营纺织厂的降温建设费用。三月间，中央纺织工业部和中国纺织工会全国委员会发出了联合指示，在指示里要求各局、厂必须在六月底以前基本上完成降温设备安装任务，争取在七月初以前使用起来，并要求各地区在四月份对降温工作进行一次全面检查。他们还组织了安全降温的专门检查小组，有重点地检查了上海和中南的安全降温准备工作。全国各主要省、市的纺织管理机构为了贯彻降温安全会议的精神，也都先后作了一些工作。
    华东纺织管理局曾在所属国营纺织、印染等二十五个厂中，以四百亿元左右的资金，在细纱及布机车间重点装置了降温设备，降低了车间温度，基本上消灭了车间工人晕倒的现象。今年该局在降温设备方面的投资，共达五百六十亿元，占该局基本建设投资总额的二分之一以上。该局在三十一个工厂中设置了大小冷风设备共四十六套，除国营上海第十八棉纺织厂外，全部国营棉纺细纱车间今年都有了冷风设备的装置。青岛纺织管理局在所属各厂降温设备方面的投资达一百二十二亿元，在所属棉纺厂增添了四套冷风机，四百八十台排气风扇和将近二百台的喷雾机、鼓风机、喷雾头等设备。此外，还开掘了很多水井，利用井内的冷水来充分发挥冷风机的作用。华北纺织管理局所属各纺织厂三年来已先后装置了不少降温设备，今年该局又投资了二百一十二亿元，新添了送风机六套，计划打井十四口，现已完成七口。东北纺织管理局今年投资三百三十亿元，全区国营纺织厂新添了送风机二十八部，换气风扇一百九十九部，新掘井九口；以上设备预计七月初可以全部完成，开始送风。西北各国营棉纺厂今年也装置了许多降温设备，各厂降温装设工程最迟在七月初即可全部完成。西南六一○、六一一、六一二等厂普遍在机器马达上安装隔热设备，并在马达旁开地沟，安装排气风管。中南各厂纺织车间因装置了降温设备，室内温度大为降低。国营武汉第一棉纺厂车间里的送风机每分钟可将八千五百立方吋的新鲜空气送入车间，使车间温度最高不超过九十三度。
    今年公私合营和私营纺织厂也普遍展开了降温工作。江西九江公私合营兴中纺纱厂今年在细纱车间设置本生式喷雾器二十八个，改装地道通风和断头吸棉装置通风地道，以排出机器和马达的发热量。在厂房周围新打井八口，用苏联式小型送风机四套以低温水洗涤冷却室外空气，向车间输送冷风，降低车间温度。杭州市公私合营杭江纱厂的降低温度工作是以细纱车间为重点。具体措施有七种，其中规模最大的是装置冷风洗濯室。此外，苏州、无锡、杭州、武汉等市的私营纺织厂在政府的督导下，车间的降温设备都有相当改善。
    今年全国各纺织厂降温设备改善后，将大大有益于工人健康，可以减少疾病，提高生产。浙江虎林丝厂由于初步改善了车间降温设备，五月份出勤率已比原计划提高，对减少断头、减少次布都有很大好处。国营青岛第二棉纺织厂调整了车间温湿度后，次布和断头大大减少，提高了质量和看台能力，为进一步推广郝建秀工作法和五一织布工作法创造了有利的条件。
