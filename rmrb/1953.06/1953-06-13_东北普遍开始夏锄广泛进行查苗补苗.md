    Summer hoeing has universally begun in Northeast China, with extensive seedling inspection and replanting underway.
    This year, the spring sowing work in Northeast China proceeded relatively smoothly and rapidly. After completing wheat sowing in mid-April, various localities generally began sowing in the fields at the end of April, and most of the sowing was completed around May 20th. The sowing period was generally shortened by about ten days compared to previous years. It is estimated that the sown area for various crops can generally be completed according to plan for major grain crops, except for wheat, which is expected to complete 90% of the plan, and cotton, which is expected to complete 80% of the plan. The sown area for soybeans may even exceed the plan. Currently, the weather is favorable with adequate rainfall, and the growth of seedlings is generally good. In the southern regions, wheat is already over a foot tall and has begun to joint; in the northern regions, wheat is already six or seven inches tall. Millet, sorghum, corn, and other crops have generally grown one or two inches. Most of the soybeans have emerged. Cotton seedlings are over three inches tall and growing vigorously.
    One of the characteristics of the spring sowing work in Northeast China is the focused promotion of the abundant harvest experience of Zhaoyuan County and the universal summarization and promotion of local abundant harvest experiences, which improved farming techniques. This year, the area where wheat seeds were disinfected during wheat sowing increased by more than 100,000 hectares compared to last year; the general sowing amount per hectare reached 300 to 350 jin, an increase of about 100 jin compared to the past. Many areas implemented reasonable shallow mulching during soil covering, resulting in even emergence, rapid growth, and good development of wheat seedlings. Field farming techniques have also been significantly improved. According to preliminary statistics from 24 counties in Heilongjiang Province on May 19, over 610,000 hectares of sown land adopted new farming methods and implemented close planting, accounting for 38.5% of the sown area in these 24 counties.
    The 973 agricultural technical guidance stations established in Northeast China were generally able to provide specific guidance to farmers on the use of new farm tools during spring plowing and cultivated a large number of farmer technicians. According to statistics from 26 technical guidance stations in eight counties and cities, including Jixian, Hailun, and Shulan, a total of 3,430 farmer technicians were trained during the spring plowing period. In villages within the scope of the technical guidance stations, most mutual aid and cooperative organizations have formulated production increase plans, improved labor organization, and played a leading and exemplary role for general villages.
    The main reasons for the great achievements in spring sowing in various localities are the earnest implementation of the Central Committee's instructions, treating spring plowing and production as the overriding central task in rural areas, strengthening leadership in spring plowing and production, and beginning to improve work style. Zhaoyuan County adopted a leadership method of "focusing on one point, covering multiple aspects, performing on-site demonstrations, conducting chain visits, and circulating down to the villages." Hailun County cadres obtained and began to promote the experience of "grouping and dividing leadership, dispersing and gathering at times, promoting through typical examples, and spreading layer by layer." Other counties generally also used key leadership methods of dividing areas and sections, assigning responsibilities on a long-term or short-term basis, cadres went deep into villages, met directly with the masses, specifically implemented policies, brought into play the production enthusiasm of the masses, and further consolidated and improved mutual aid and cooperative organizations. During spring plowing, more than 5,200 agricultural production cooperatives were established in various localities. Various types of mutual aid teams have seen new development. During this period, Lin Feng, Vice Chairman of the Northeast Administrative Committee, Du Zheheng, Deputy Director of the Financial and Economic Committee of the Northeast Administrative Committee, and the provincial governors of each province led cadres deep into the countryside to conduct inspections and supervision, which powerfully promoted spring plowing and production.
    In order to further consolidate the victory of spring plowing and ensure a bumper harvest in the autumn, the Northeast Administrative Committee issued instructions on May 21 to carry out summer hoeing work. The masses in various localities have universally turned to summer hoeing. In counties such as Liaoyang and Haicheng, wheat fields have been hoed for the first time, and in some cotton fields in Haicheng County, the first hoeing has been completed. In the southern regions of Liaodong and Rehe Provinces, 20% of sorghum and millet have been hoed for the first time. In Kaiyuan in Liaoxi, Fuyu in Jilin, and Suihua in Heilongjiang, some wheat fields have also been top-dressed once with fertilizer. In order to ensure full seedling establishment and strive for increased grain production, many regions have launched seedling inspection and replanting campaigns.

    东北普遍开始夏锄广泛进行查苗补苗
    今年东北区春耕播种工作进行得较为顺利、迅速。各地自四月中旬完成麦播之后，在四月末普遍开种大田，至五月二十日左右即大部种完。播种期一般的比往年缩短十天左右。各种作物播种面积，估计除小麦可完成计划百分之九十、棉花可完成计划百分之八十以外，主要粮食作物一般可按计划完成；大豆播种面积并可超过计划。目前各地雨水调和，禾苗生育普遍良好，南部地区小麦已有一尺多高，开始拔节；北部地区小麦已高达六、七寸。谷子、高粱、苞米等一般已长出一二寸。豆子已大部出苗。棉苗长出三寸多，生育旺盛。
    东北各地春耕播种工作的特点之一，是有重点地推行了肇源县的丰产经验和普遍总结推广了当地的丰产经验，改进了耕作技术。今年麦播中，小麦种子实行消毒的比去年增加了十余万垧；一般的每垧播种量达到三百斤到三百五十斤，比过去增加一百斤左右。许多地区在覆土时实行了合理浅培，因而麦苗出的齐，长的快，生育良好。大田耕作技术也有了显著改进。据黑龙江省二十四县五月十九日初步统计，在已播种的地中有六十一万多垧采用了新耕作法，实行了密植，占这二十四县已播种面积的百分之三十八点五。
    东北各地已建立起的九百七十三个农业技术指导站，在春耕中多能具体指导农民使用新农具，并培养了大量的农民技术手。据集贤、海伦、舒兰等八个县市的二十六个技术指导站的统计，春耕期间共训练农民技术手三千四百三十人。在技术指导站指导范围内的村屯，多数互助合作组织都订了增产计划，改进了劳动组织，对一般村屯起了带头和示范作用。
    各地春耕播种取得很大成绩的主要原因是认真贯彻了中央的指示，把春耕生产做为农村中压倒一切的中心工作，加强了春耕生产的领导，开始改进了工作作风。肇源县采取了“一点多面，实地表演，连环参观，循环下乡”的领导方法。海伦县区干部取得了并开始推广了“分组、分片领导，时分时散，通过典型，层层推开”的经验。其他各县一般的也都运用了按段分片、常年分工包干、短期分工分片的重点领导方法，干部深入村屯，与群众直接见面，具体地贯彻政策，发挥群众生产积极性，进一步巩固和提高了互助合作组织。春耕中，各地建立了农业生产合作社五千二百多个。各种类型互助组有了新的发展。在这一时期，东北行政委员会林枫副主席、东北行政委员会财政经济委员会杜者蘅副主任以及各省省主席都率领干部深入农村，进行了检查督促，有力地推动了春耕生产。
    为了进一步巩固春耕胜利，确保秋季丰收，东北行政委员会已于五月二十一日发出了开展夏锄工作的指示。各地群众已普遍转入夏锄。辽阳、海城等县麦田已铲完头遍苗，海城县有的棉田已完成头遍铲?。辽东、热河两省南部地区已有百分之二十的高粱、谷子开铲头遍。辽西开原、吉林扶余、黑龙江绥化等县并有部分麦田上了一遍追肥。为保证全苗，力争粮食增产，许多地区展开了查苗补苗运动。（东北行政委员会农业局办公室）
