The anti-waste, anti-irresponsibility, and establishment of a responsibility system movement launched by the basic construction departments under the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry has entered the construction phase. More than ten units, including the Beijing Work Area of the Directly Subordinate Construction Engineering Company of the Ministry of Heavy Industry, the headquarters of the company, the Anshan Iron and Steel Company's Steelmaking Construction Engineering Company, the Second Engineering Company of the Nonferrous Metals Industry Administration, and the Benxi Industrial Engineering Company, have begun to steadily establish various responsibility systems.

These construction units that have begun to enter the stage of establishing a responsibility system have shown a common characteristic in the process of carrying out the anti-waste, anti-irresponsibility, and establishment of a responsibility system movement. That is, the leading cadres of each unit have a very clear understanding of the purpose and requirements of the movement. While mobilizing the masses of employees to expose waste and irresponsibility, they have planned and prepared for the establishment of a responsibility system. Therefore, the movement can smoothly transition from the climax of exposure to the stage of construction. For example, the Beijing Work Area of the Directly Subordinate Construction Engineering Company, when it began to brew the exposure of waste and irresponsibility, established a central group for studying and formulating systems, and began to study and preliminarily formulate the administrative responsibility system, dispatch system, and group economic accounting system for each department, and combined with the preparation of construction, compiled construction organization designs and operation plans. Therefore, after the mass exposure stage ended, the operation plan and the draft of the group economic accounting system were promptly handed over to the worker groups for discussion, and the drafts of other systems were handed over to the relevant departments for discussion and revision. The work area also paid attention to training many cadres while preparing for the construction phase, and these cadres subsequently became the backbone of the construction phase. In addition, during the construction process, lectures and discussions on "Operation Plan," "Dispatch System," and "Group Economic Accounting" were organized to explain the role and content of these systems to employees.

The Anshan Iron and Steel Company's Steelmaking Construction Engineering Company led the employees to analyze typical examples of waste and irresponsibility, find out the causes, and draw conclusions, which prepared the ground for establishing the responsibility system. At the same time, drafts of various responsibility systems were drawn up and promptly submitted to employees for discussion. The Nanhu construction site of the Second Engineering Company of the Nonferrous Metals Industry Administration, after analyzing and studying the shutdowns, rework, and safety accidents that occurred within half a month of the start of construction during the movement, decided to first establish a technical responsibility system including a drawing review system, technical review system, and handover inspection system. The Benxi Industrial Engineering Company, in response to the poor quality of projects last year, first established a technical responsibility system, and then worked hard to establish an administrative responsibility system and a construction responsibility system.

The above-mentioned units paid attention to conducting ideological education for employees in each stage of the movement, criticizing those cadres who treated the establishment of the responsibility system with a wrong attitude, commending those responsible cadres, and promptly eliminating the ideological concerns of technical personnel and staff, listening to their opinions, and respecting their authority. This has enabled the masses of employees to maintain full enthusiasm in the movement. These units also organized employees to study the advanced management systems of the Soviet Union to improve their management skills.

However, some units were caught off guard at the turning point of the movement because they did not prepare well for the construction phase. For example, when the Dalian Chemical Engineering Company and the Jilin Chemical Engineering Company ended the exposure work, the leading cadres did not know how to carry out the construction work in the next stage. Another example is the current movement of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant Engineering Company, which is better than the previous stage, and the masses have been mobilized, but when establishing the responsibility system, they do not distinguish between priorities and emergencies, do not distinguish between primary and secondary, and want to establish various systems such as project management, personnel management, welfare, health, technical safety, and confidentiality regulations. Recently, a total of more than 80 kinds of systems have been drafted and are waiting for review and discussion. On the other hand, the necessary operation plan, dispatch system, and urgently needed technical quality responsibility system after the start of the project, and the responsibility system for the site director, construction worker, and worker group leader have not yet been compiled and formulated, and have not been discussed and implemented first. This disperses the strength, makes the project that has already started still chaotic, and cannot quickly and effectively solve the current main problems. The First Engineering Company of the Nonferrous Metals Industry Administration has been sloppy in establishing the responsibility system. At a technical management professional meeting, it took only one day to discuss the dispatch system, technical responsibility system, quality responsibility system, and measurement and statistics, etc., and as a result, nothing was discussed well. The Eighth Cement Plant of the Building Materials Industry Administration hastily formulated a few systems and wanted to end it after entering the construction phase. These units must better study the instructions of their superiors, learn from the experience of advanced units, and establish a responsibility system in a planned and step-by-step manner to achieve greater results from the movement.

Units that are still in the brewing and exposure stage, such as the Third and Fourth Engineering Companies of the Nonferrous Metals Industry Administration, the Iron and Steel Industry Administration, the Central China Iron and Steel Engineering Company, the Southwest Iron and Steel Engineering Company, the Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Plant, the Yunnan Tin Company, the Dongchuan Mining Bureau, and Factory 501, should select capable cadres, combine with the current work, and make preparations for the establishment of the responsibility system as soon as possible to avoid the "disconnection" phenomenon of the movement at the end of the exposure stage.

### 中央重工业部基本建设施工单位  建立责任制运动进入建设阶段

    中央重工业部基本建设施工单位
    建立责任制运动进入建设阶段
    【本报讯】中央重工业部所属各基本建设施工部门开展的反浪费、反无人负责和建立责任制运动，开始进入建设阶段。重工业部直属建设工程公司北京工区及该公司本部、鞍山钢铁公司炼钢建筑工程公司、有色金属工业管理局第二工程公司和本溪工业工程公司等十多个单位，开始稳步地建立各项责任制。
    这些开始进入建立责任制阶段的施工单位，在开展反浪费、反无人负责和建立责任制运动的过程中，表现了一个共同的特点。这就是各单位的领导干部对于运动的目的和要求有着很明确的认识。他们在发动职工群众揭发浪费和无人负责现象的同时，就有计划地做了建立责任制的准备工作。因此，运动能够顺利地从揭发的高潮转入建设的阶段。例如直属建设工程公司北京工区，在开始酝酿揭发浪费和无人负责现象时，就成立了研究订立制度的中心小组，着手研究和初步拟订各部门的行政专责制、调度制和小组经济核算制，并结合施工的准备工作，编制施工组织设计和作业计划。因此，当群众性的揭发阶段结束后，就及时地把作业计划和小组经济核算制草案交给工人小组讨论，把其他各种制度草案分别交给有关部门讨论修改。该工区在为建设阶段作准备工作时，还注意培养了许多干部，这些干部随后都成了建设阶段的骨干。此外，在建设过程中，还组织了关于“作业计划”、“调度制度”、“小组经济核算”等讲座和讨论会，向职工解释这些制度的作用和内容。
    鞍钢炼钢建筑工程公司，领导职工群众对典型的浪费和无人负责事例进行了分析，找出了原因和作出了结论，为建立责任制做好了准备工作。同时拟订了各种责任制度草案，及时地交给职工讨论。有色金属工业管理局第二工程公司的南湖工地，在运动中分析和研究了开工半个月内发生的停工、返工和保安事故后，决定首先建立包括图纸会审制、技术复查制、交接检验制等的技术责任制。本溪工业工程公司针对去年工程质量低劣现象，首先建立技术责任制，接着抓紧建立行政专责制度和施工责任制。
    上面这些单位，在运动的每一阶段，都注意对职工进行思想教育，批判那些以错误的态度对待建立责任制的干部，表扬那些认真负责的干部，及时地消除技术人员和职员的思想顾虑，倾听他们的意见，尊重他们的职权。这就使职工群众在运动中始终保持着饱满的情绪。这些单位还组织职工学习苏联先进的管理制度，提高他们的管理业务水平。
    但是，有些单位由于没有做好建设阶段的准备工作，在运动转变的关头就手忙脚乱。例如大连化工工程公司和吉林化工工程公司结束揭发工作时，领导干部就不知道怎样进行下一阶段的建设工作。又如石景山钢铁厂工程公司目前的运动较前一阶段开展得较好，群众已发动起来了，但是在建立责任制时不分先后缓急，不分主要次要，把工程管理、人事管理、福利、卫生、技术安全以及保密条例等等各种制度都想建立起来，最近一共草拟了八十多种制度等着审核，讨论。而另一方面工程开工后又必需要的作业计划、调度制度以及急需的技术质量责任制，和工地主任、施工员、工人小组长等的专责制都尚未编制与订立，更没有尽先讨论、执行。这样就分散了力量，使已开工的工程依旧混乱，不能迅速而有效地解决当前的主要问题。有色金属工业管理局第一工程公司在建立责任制时有草率现象，在一个技术管理专业会议上，只用一天时间就讨论了调度制、技术责任制、质量责任制以及测量、统计等问题，结果一样也没有讨论好。建筑器材工业管理局第八水泥厂进入建设阶段后，草率地拟了几条制度就要结束。这些单位必须更好地学习上级指示，学习先进单位的经验，有领导有步骤地建立责任制，使运动收到更大的效果。
    目前尚在酝酿、揭发阶段的单位如有色金属工业管理局第三、第四工程公司，钢铁工业管理局、华中钢铁工程公司、西南钢铁工程公司、马鞍山炼铁厂、云南锡业公司、东川矿务局以及五○一厂等单位，应抽出得力干部，结合当前工作，及早做好建立责任制的准备工作，以免在揭发阶段结束时，使运动发生“脱节”现象。
