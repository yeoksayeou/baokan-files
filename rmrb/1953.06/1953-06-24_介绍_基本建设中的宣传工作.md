Basic construction is an important part of our country's economic construction. Therefore, it is necessary to attach importance to mass propaganda and mobilization work in basic construction, and to use persuasion and education methods to improve workers' political awareness, encourage workers to develop creative labor, and strive to better complete the tasks of basic construction. The Party organizations in the Northeast region have paid attention to propaganda work in basic construction in a timely manner, and have gained initial experience in the past year. This is a correct approach to meet the needs of the country's large-scale economic construction. The book "Propaganda Work in Basic Construction" is a brief introduction to the experience of propaganda work in basic construction in the Northeast region in 1952, and can be used as a reference for political work comrades at all levels in basic construction departments across the country.

The book "Propaganda Work in Basic Construction" collects a total of nine articles. These include an overview of propaganda work in industrial basic construction in the Northeast region in 1952, an introduction to the experience of the Anshan and Harbin Municipal Party Committees in leading basic construction propaganda work, an introduction to the experience of organizing cultural forces to serve basic construction, an introduction to the experience of radio stations and propaganda networks in basic construction sites, and a more comprehensive introduction to the experience of how to lead grassroots organizations in political work in basic construction sites, such as "Political Work in the Concrete Engineering Team of the Anshan Seamless Steel Tube Plant Construction Site." From these articles, we can see some of the experiences gained by Party organizations at all levels in the Northeast region in carrying out propaganda work at basic construction sites in 1952.

First, it is necessary to strengthen and enrich the institutions and forces of political work departments in basic construction. Because basic construction is a completely new work, there are few cadres for Party and mass work, and the Party and League forces are weak. This is one of the characteristics of the initial establishment of basic construction departments. Under these circumstances, the Party committees at all levels in the Northeast promptly carried out various measures to strengthen political work. In addition to sending a large number of political work cadres, political offices (with propaganda sections/groups) were established in various engineering companies and important construction sites, and a political instructor system was established in some newly established engineering teams. Short-term ideological education was also conducted for the cadres newly assigned to the basic construction departments. The propaganda departments of the provincial and municipal Party committees all designated the director or deputy director or the head of the propaganda section to specifically study and lead propaganda work in basic construction. In this way, the phenomenon of no one taking care of propaganda work in basic construction was initially overcome.

Second, attaching importance to the ideological education of workers and mobilizing workers to learn technology and advanced experience are the main methods to improve the working class consciousness and labor enthusiasm of basic construction workers. Basic construction workers come from all directions and lack a correct understanding of the glorious position of basic construction, and their labor enthusiasm is not high. Therefore, after a large number of workers enter the construction site, it is necessary to organize political instructors to compile political teaching materials and propaganda outlines to carry out in-depth propaganda and education, so that they can understand the importance of basic construction and establish the thinking of being masters of the country. At the same time, a portion of the recruited workers will inevitably have lower technical levels and will not be able to meet the needs of the construction tasks. Therefore, it is necessary to carry out production propaganda to ensure the rapid promotion of advanced experience and to support production innovators in a timely manner. Various regions have explored some experience in this regard. The Harbin Municipal Party Committee organized several exhibitions on advanced experience, new operating methods, and improved labor organization, as well as conferences to reward advanced producers. Some construction areas also organized "field training platforms" for practice and technical training classes. Workers learned technology, worked with peace of mind, and labor productivity was thereby improved.

Third, organize cultural service teams to go deep into construction sites to encourage the labor enthusiasm of employees. Another characteristic of basic construction is that most of the construction sites are located in inconvenient suburbs, and the work foundation of trade union cultural and educational departments is weak, so workers lack cultural and recreational activities. The Party committees of various provinces and cities in the Northeast have uniformly organized the cultural and educational forces of their provinces and cities to establish "Basic Construction Cultural Service Teams," which, under the direct leadership of the Communist Youth League committees, cultural and educational bureaus, literary federations, Sino-Soviet Friendship Associations, Xinhua Bookstores, and other units, carry out various propaganda and education work. The main activities of the cultural service teams include: screening films and slides, performing dramas and folk art programs, exhibiting books and pictures (including picture clippings introducing Soviet communist construction and employee life, advanced experience and advanced figures), organizing games (various chess, poker, crown balls, etc.), teaching singing, holding story evenings, game competitions, and various forums. These literary and artistic activities combined with production play a great role in raising workers' ideological awareness and encouraging workers to learn advanced experience. On the basis of in-depth activities at the construction site, the cultural service team, in coordination with the political staff at the construction site, discovers and cultivates activists growing from the workers, and establishes the construction site workers' amateur literary and art group, which lays the foundation for carrying out regular propaganda work among basic construction workers. The experience of various construction sites in the Northeast proves that with the help of the cultural service team, the workers established cultural and entertainment groups and wrote many clappers and shadow plays that combined with production, which powerfully encouraged the production enthusiasm and creativity of the masses.

Fourth, establish and develop a propaganda network, face production, and lay a solid foundation for systematic mass propaganda work in basic construction. In various mass propaganda activities, various construction sites have discovered a large number of activists who have correct thinking and have a certain ability to publicize and mobilize. The propaganda work departments of the Party at the construction sites must formulate plans in a timely manner in accordance with the decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on establishing a propaganda network for the people throughout the Party, and establish a Party propaganda network in the basic construction departments. Here, two erroneous understandings must be corrected: one is that the workers at the construction site are very active and already have entertainment activities, and therefore the important role of establishing a propaganda network is ignored; the other is that the basic construction workers come from all directions and have complex components, and therefore they dare not establish a propaganda network. The experience of the Northeast region in establishing propaganda networks in basic construction departments proves that it is necessary to quickly establish and develop the Party's propaganda network on the basis of the cultural service team going deep into the construction site and carrying out extensive activities, face production, and make propaganda work serve production work. Gradually improve various systems for leading propaganda network work from production propaganda activities, improve the level of propaganda work, and encourage basic construction workers to overfulfill the national plan. This is not only necessary, but also completely possible.

The experience introduced in the book "Propaganda Work in Basic Construction" is of certain reference value for the political work departments of basic construction in various regions. However, the compilation of this book is not perfect. The main problem is that there are fewer specialized and typical experience summaries. For example, there is only one article similar to "The Propaganda Network Work of a Basic Construction Site," the introduction of "The Radio Station in the Anshan Basic Construction Site" is too brief, and there is not even one article introducing the activities of model propaganda workers at the construction site. In fact, for general propaganda work cadres and leaders of grassroots propaganda work, in addition to introducing general work experience, it is very necessary to introduce more specialized experience.

    介绍“基本建设中的宣传工作”

    基本建设是我国经济建设中的重要环节。因此，必须重视基本建设中的群众宣传鼓动工作，以说服教育的方法，来提高工人的政治水平，鼓励工人发扬创造性的劳动，为更好地完成基本建设的任务而斗争。东北区的党组织及时地注意了基本建设中的宣传工作，去年一年以来，已获得了初步经验。这是适应国家大规模经济建设需要的正确作法。“基本建设中的宣传工作”一书，就是一九五二年东北区基本建设中的宣传工作经验的简要介绍，可供各地基本建设部门各级政治工作同志参考。
       “基本建设中的宣传工作”一书，共收集了九篇文章。包括一九五二年东北地区工业基本建设中宣传工作的概述，中共鞍山市委、哈尔滨市委领导基本建设宣传工作的经验介绍，组织文化力量为基本建设服务的经验介绍，基本建设工地中广播站、宣传网等工作的经验介绍，以及较全面地介绍了如何在基本建设工地领导基层组织政治工作方面经验的
    “鞍山无缝钢管厂工地混凝土工程队的政治工作”等。从这些文章中，我们可以看到一九五二年东北区各级党组织在基本建设工地进行宣传工作中所获得的一些经验。
    第一，必须加强和充实基本建设中政治工作部门的机构和力量。由于基本建设是一项完全新的工作，党与群众工作的干部少，党、团力量薄弱，这是基本建设部门初建立时的特点之一。东北的各级党委在这种情况下，及时地进行了加强政治工作的各种措施。除派遣大批政治工作干部外，还在各工程公司及重要工地成立了政治处（下设宣传科、组），在某些新成立的工程队中建立了政治指导员制。并对于新派入基本建设部门的干部，进行了短期的思想教育。各省、市党委宣传部都指定正副部长或宣传处处长专门研究和领导基本建设中的宣传工作。这样，就初步克服了基本建设中宣传工作无人照顾的现象。
    第二，重视工人的思想教育，发动工人学习技术和先进经验，是提高基本建设工人阶级觉悟和劳动热情的主要方法。基本建设工人来自四面八方，对基本建设的光荣岗位缺乏正确认识，劳动热情不高；因此，在大批工人进入工地后，就必须针对他们的思想情况，组织政治教员，编写政治教材、宣传提纲，进行深入的宣传教育，使他们认识基本建设的重要性，树立国家主人翁的思想。同时，招来的大批工人中必有一部分技术水平较低，不能适应建设任务的需要；因此，就必须进行生产宣传，保证先进经验的迅速推广，并及时支持生产革新者。各地在这一方面都摸索到一些经验。哈尔滨市委组织了数次关于先进经验、新操作方法、改进劳动组织的展览及奖励先进生产者的大会。某些工区还组织“野外操练台”进行实习及技术训练班等。工人学到了技术，工作安心了，劳动生产率也因而得到提高。
    第三，组织文化服务队深入工地，鼓舞职工劳动热情。基本建设的另一特点，是工地大部都在交通不便的郊外，工会文教部门的工作基础薄弱，因而工人的文化娱乐活动甚为缺乏。东北各省、市党委都统一组织了本省、市的文教力量，成立了“基本建设文化服务队”，由青年团团委、文教局、文联、中苏友协、新华书店等单位，在工会文教部门的直接领导下，进行各种宣传教育工作。文化服务队的活动内容主要是：放映电影和幻灯，演出戏剧和曲艺节目，展览图书、图片（包括介绍苏联共产主义建设和职工生活、先进经验和先进人物的画报剪贴等），组织游艺（各种棋类、扑克、克朗球等），教唱歌，举办故事晚会、游艺比赛及各种座谈会等。上述这些和生产相结合的文艺活动，对于提高工人的思想觉悟，鼓励工人学习先进经验，是起着很大作用的。文化服务队在深入工地活动的基础上，协同工地政治工作人员，发现和培养从工人中生长的积极分子，成立工地工人业余文艺小组，这便给在基本建设职工中开展经常性的宣传工作打下了基础。东北各工地的经验证明，在文化服务队的帮助下，工人成立了文娱小组，编写了许多结合生产的快板、洋片等，都极有力地鼓舞了群众的生产积极性和创造性。
    第四，建立和发展宣传网，面向生产，为基本建设中系统的群众宣传工作打下坚实的基础。各工地在群众性的各种宣传活动中，发现了大批思想正确，并具有一定宣传鼓动能力的积极分子。工地党的宣传工作部门必须根据中共中央关于在全党建立对人民群众的宣传网决定，及时订出计划，在基本建设部门建立党的宣传网。这里，必须纠正两种错误的认识：一种是认为工地的工人活动性大，并已有了文娱活动，因而忽视了建立宣传网的重要作用；另一种是认为基本建设工人来自四面八方，成份复杂，因而不敢建立宣传网。东北区在基本建设部门建立宣传网的经验证明：必须在文化服务队深入工地展开广泛活动的基础上，迅速建立和发展党的宣传网，面向生产，使宣传工作为生产工作服务。从生产宣传活动中逐步健全领导宣传网工作的各种制度，提高宣传工作水平，鼓舞基本建设工人超额完成国家计划，这不仅是必需的，而且也是完全可能做到的。
       “基本建设中的宣传工作”一书所介绍的经验，对于各地基本建设政治工作部门是有一定的参考价值的。但是，这本书的编写，还有不够完善的地方。主要是专门性的典型经验总结较少。如类似“一个基本建设工地的宣传网工作”这样的文章只有一篇，“鞍山基本建设工地中的广播站”的介绍过于简略了，介绍工地模范宣传员活动的文章一篇也没有。而在实际上，对于一般宣传工作干部和基层宣传工作的领导人来说，除了介绍一般的工作经验以外，多介绍一些专门性的经验，却是十分必要的。
