Large-Scale Huai River Project

One of the massive construction projects in the third year of the Huai River harnessing project - the Sanhe Sluice Gate, towering on the east bank of Hongze Lake, is nearing completion after the tireless efforts of over 60,000 workers, farmers, and soldiers day and night. After the completion of this sluice gate, not only will the floodwaters of Hongze Lake be able to be contained in a controlled manner, reducing the threat of floods to the canal embankments and ensuring the harvest of crops in the Lixiahe area of northern Jiangsu, but it can also be used to irrigate vast farmland. The Sanhe Gate is approximately 700 meters long and has 63 openings.

Soviet water conservancy expert Bukov visited the Sanhe Gate construction site to help us solve difficulties in our work.

Female technicians are surveying the terrain of the Sanhe Gate, preparing to further utilize this control project to develop multi-objective water conservancy construction.

Workers constructing the Fozi Ridge Reservoir installed concrete lifting steel towers to transport concrete to dozens of meters in the air.

The Fozi Ridge Reservoir is also one of the massive construction projects of the Huai River harnessing project. Now, the first phase of construction of this reservoir has come to an end. The construction of this reservoir will reduce part of the flood volume of the Pi River and the Huai River main stream below Zhengyangguan. 500,000 mu of farmland on the right bank of the middle and lower reaches of the Pi River can be irrigated. At the same time, it can also develop shipping and supply a small amount of electricity to rural areas.

Workers at the Fozi Ridge Reservoir construction site are installing giant flood discharge steel pipes.

The Fozi Ridge Reservoir construction site is busy day and night.

In order to comprehensively solve the problem of waterlogging in the Huai River basin, it is necessary to first do a good job in planning and design. This survey team, composed of more than 2,000 people, is working intensively on the豫皖 (Yu Wan) Great Plain.

The first phase of construction of the Fozi Ridge Reservoir has come to an end. Workers are dismantling the formwork used for pouring concrete on the arch dam.

    规模巨大的治淮工程
    第三年度治淮工程中的巨大建设工程之一——耸立在洪泽湖东岸的三河节制闸，经过六万多工人、农民和战士们的日夜努力，其全部建设工程已接近完成阶段。这座水闸建成后，不仅可使洪泽湖的洪水能有节制地拦蓄起来，减轻洪水对运河堤岸的威胁，保证苏北里下河地区庄稼的收成，同时还可以用来灌溉广大的农田。三河闸长约七百公尺，共六十三孔。
    苏联水利专家布可夫到三河闸工地，帮助我们解决工作中的困难。
    女技术人员在测绘三河闸的地形，准备进一步利用三河闸这一控制工程，来发展多目标水利建设。
    建设佛子岭水库的工人们安装了混凝土的升高钢塔，要把混凝土运送到几十公尺的高空中去。
    佛子岭水库也是治淮工程的巨大建设工程之一，现在这座水库的第一期建设工程已告一段落。由于这座水库的兴建，将使渒河和淮河干流正阳关以下的洪水来量减少一部分，渒河中下游右岸的五十万亩农田可得到灌溉，同时还能发展航运和供给农村少量的电力。
    佛子岭水库工地工人们正在安装巨型的泄洪钢管。
    佛子岭水库工地上，日夜都在忙碌着。
    为了全面解决淮河流域地区的内涝问题，必须首先做好规划设计工作。这一支由二千多人组成的测量队，正在豫皖大平原上紧张地工作着。
    佛子岭水库第一期建设工程已告一段落，工人们正在拆除连拱坝上浇筑混凝土用的模子板。
