    Many Factories and Mines Conduct Thorough Ideological Mobilization and Establish Systems to Implement the Suggestions of Soviet Experts

    [Reported by this newspaper] Factories and mines across the country are actively learning and promoting advanced Soviet experiences and implementing the suggestions of Soviet experts, which has improved work and accelerated the progress and quality of both basic construction and production.
    In the construction of the large-scale rolling mill and seamless steel tube plant, two major projects of Anshan Iron and Steel Company, advanced Soviet construction methods were implemented, and five processing plants for concrete mixing, wooden molds, steel bars, riveting, and sanitary pipelines were established successively for factory-based construction, manufacturing various finished or semi-finished products. These processing plants completed the amount of work that would have taken about two years in the past within five months, and the product quality was also much better than that of decentralized manufacturing. Shenyang Smelter implemented the Soviet expert's suggestion of "sulfur addition to remove copper," which increased the quality of electrolytic lead from 99.98% to over 99.99%. After the zinc electrolysis workshop implemented the Soviet expert's suggestion, the actual zinc recovery rate increased by 5%. Northeast 21st Engineering Company accepted more than 300 suggestions from Soviet experts in mechanical installation engineering, which directly ensured the smooth completion of the installation plan. Northeast 401 Factory, during last year's increase production and practice economy campaign, increased production value by 10.1 billion yuan due to the implementation of Soviet experts' suggestions. The quality of products from the Northeast State-owned Third Paper Mill was not high initially, but after accepting the Soviet expert's suggestion, utilizing equipment such as glazing machines and cooling cylinders, and improving the pulping method, the quality problem was basically solved. According to the opinions of Soviet experts, Petroleum Plant No. 9 adopted measures such as "passing water under the furnace, spray cooling, reducing block size, and strengthening ventilation," which increased the amount of ore processed and the oil yield. Xi'an Coal Mine accepted valuable suggestions and advanced technology and experience from Soviet experts in restoring and renovating old mine entrances, changing backward coal mining methods, and improving labor efficiency. At the beginning of the Central Shaft Sinking Project, the single-line operation method was used for rock drilling, and the highest monthly progress record was only 18 meters. Later, more than 30 important suggestions from Soviet experts, such as parallel operation and deep-hole operation, were implemented, and the average monthly progress of shaft construction reached more than 30 meters.
    Thanks to the assistance of Soviet experts, Zhengzhou Power Plant saved a lot of wealth for the country in design and construction. For example, boiler water generally needs to be softened with a softening agent. Based on the local water quality, Soviet experts designed a water treatment room that uses lime to soften hard water, replacing the softening agent imported from abroad with local lime. According to the design standards of Britain and the United States, wooden piles needed to be driven into the yellow soil for the foundation of the main plant building. After testing the soil quality, Soviet experts believed that there was no need to drive piles, which allowed the project to proceed two months ahead of schedule and saved the country more than 1 billion yuan.
    During the first stage of exploration in the Daye Tieshan mining area, the 429 Geological Exploration Team of the Central Geological Department conscientiously studied advanced Soviet geological exploration experience. After observing all the exploration sites, Soviet experts put forward many valuable suggestions. They suggested that geological exploration is a comprehensive work, and various types of work must be closely coordinated to give full play to their effectiveness. This advanced exploration concept was of great help to the geological exploration personnel of the 429 Team. The geological exploration personnel of the 429 Team had doubted for a long time whether there were new mineral deposits in the Daye Tieshan mining area, but after referring to the Soviet experts' suggestions, combining the results of geophysical exploration with the inferences of geological personnel, and conducting drilling, they discovered huge magnetite deposits.
    Some cadres in factories and mines have gained a lot of experience in implementing the suggestions of Soviet experts. Cadres of the Xi'an Mining Bureau believe that to implement the suggestions of Soviet experts, first, the leadership must be determined and must strongly support the staff and masses in overcoming difficulties in the process of implementing the suggestions. Second, it is necessary to strengthen political and ideological leadership, mobilize the masses in depth, and educate workers, technicians, and cadres to overcome conservative ideas and empiricism, and truly recognize that promoting advanced Soviet experience is an important key to rapidly completing the national construction cause. Third, establish and improve necessary systems, overcome spontaneity, conduct in-depth inspections, and ensure the full implementation of Soviet experts' suggestions. The Xi'an Mining Bureau has initially established and implemented the following systems: 1. Soviet Expert Suggestion Manual System. In addition to designating special personnel to be responsible for recording, sorting, and inspecting the suggestions of Soviet experts, the leaders of the Mining Bureau stipulated that the leading personnel and key engineering and technical personnel of each mine (company) department should have special manuals to record the suggestions, decisions, and question-and-answer sessions of Soviet experts, and supervise the construction units to implement them accordingly. 2. Inspection System. It is stipulated that the leading personnel and key engineering and technical personnel of each unit must promptly inspect the implementation of Soviet experts' suggestions. 3. Reporting System. It is stipulated that each unit should sort out and report the content of the suggestions three days after the Soviet experts put forward their suggestions, and submit a written report on the implementation status after the implementation. Important suggestions should also be copied to the Party Committee, the Trade Union, and the Communist Youth League, requiring joint guarantees for implementation. 4. Implementation Responsibility System and Explanation System. It is stipulated that each suggestion should be assigned to a specific person to be responsible for implementation within a time limit, and they must be responsible for explaining the suggestions to the workers in detail. Northeast 21st Engineering Company conducted thorough ideological mobilization among all employees on implementing the suggestions of Soviet experts. Party branches and Communist Youth League branches deeply explained the importance of studying advanced Soviet experience through blackboard newspapers, radio broadcasts, and Soviet Five-Year Plan picture exhibitions, as well as Party members' meetings, Youth League meetings, and symposiums for technicians. Through these publicity and education efforts, the conservative ideas of some employees were broken, and the bourgeois technical viewpoints of some technicians were also criticized. In addition to ideological education, Northeast 21st Engineering Company also established a series of systems to ensure the implementation of Soviet experts' suggestions. For example, the administrative side stipulates that cadres above the level of captain, section chief, department head, and construction site director should regularly check their work based on the suggestions of Soviet experts every week, and check the progress of the project plan and the quality of the project; the trade union side established a "Soviet Advanced Experience Study Day" to mobilize workers to incorporate the implementation of Soviet experts' suggestions into the patriotic conventions of the team and the collective contract. The company also established a Soviet Expert Suggestion Registration Book, stipulating that from translators to field, section, class, and team, they should record in detail the opinions of Soviet experts and specific guidance in operation, and then organize technicians to compile comprehensive technical teaching materials and distribute them to various classes and teams for discussion. In addition, it is also stipulated that the technical guidance of Soviet experts should be used as the main content of technical study for one hour before work and fifteen minutes after work for workers.
    Some factories and mines still have many serious shortcomings in organizing and leading the study of advanced Soviet experience. Among these shortcomings, the main one is that general calls are more frequent than specific organizational leadership. Many units have not designated special personnel to be responsible for this work, and there is no set of methods and necessary systems to ensure the implementation of Soviet experts' suggestions. According to the current situation, in implementing the suggestions of Soviet experts and promoting advanced Soviet experience, the most important thing for factories and mines is to change the generalized leadership methods, strengthen specific leadership, conduct in-depth inspections, and formulate specific plans, designate special personnel to be responsible, and establish necessary systems.

    许多厂矿深入进行思想动员并订出制度
    贯彻执行苏联专家建议
    【本报讯】全国各地许多工厂矿山积极学习与推广苏联先进经验，贯彻执行苏联专家的建议，使工作有了改进，基本建设和生产的进度与质量都有所提高。
    鞍山钢铁公司在建设大型轧钢厂和无缝钢管厂两大主要工程时，推行了苏联先进施工方法，先后建立了工厂化施工的混凝土搅拌、木模、钢筋、铆造、卫生管道等五个加工厂，制造各种成品或半成品。这些加工厂在五个月中完成了过去需时两年左右才能完成的工程量，产品质量也比分散制造的好得多。沈阳冶炼厂贯彻执行了苏联专家“加硫脱铜”的建议，使电铅质量由百分之九十九点九八提高到百分之九十九点九九以上；锌电解车间执行苏联专家的建议后，锌实收率提高了百分之五。东北二十一工程公司在机械安装工程中，接受了苏联专家提出的三百多条建议，这些建议直接保证了安装计划的顺利完成。东北四○一厂在去年增产节约运动中，由于执行了苏联专家的建议，增产所值达一百零一亿元。东北国营第三造纸厂原来产品质量不高，接受苏联专家建议后，利用了光泽机、冷缸等设备，改进了扣解方法，质量问题得到基本解决。石油九厂根据苏联专家的意见，采取了“炉下通水，喷水冷却，降低块度，加强排风”等措施，处理矿量和出油率都提高了。西安煤矿在恢复与改建旧的坑道口，改变落后的采煤方法，提高劳动效率等方面，都接受了苏联专家的宝贵建议和先进的技术与经验。中央竖井井筒工程开始凿岩时，曾采用单行作业法，月进最高纪录仅十八公尺。后来执行了苏联专家提出的平行作业和深孔作业等三十多条重要建议，建井的速度平均月进达三十公尺以上。
    郑州电厂在设计和施工中，由于苏联专家的帮助，为国家节省了大量财富。例如锅炉用水，一般都需要用软水剂软化过。苏联专家根据当地水质情况，设计了用石灰软化硬水的水处理室，用当地的石灰代替从国外来的软水剂。主厂房的地脚工程，按照英美的设计标准，需要在黄土壤中打木桩，苏联专家化验了土质以后，认为不需要打桩，使工程提前了两个月进行，并为国家节省了十余亿元。
    在大冶铁山矿区第一阶段勘探工作中，中央地质部四二九地质勘探队认真学习苏联先进的地质勘探经验。苏联专家在观察了全部勘探工地以后，提出了许多宝贵建议。他们提出：地质勘探是综合性的工作，各种工种要密切配合，才能充分发挥效力。这种先进的勘探思想，对四二九队的地质勘探人员有极大的帮助。四二九队的地质勘探人员们对于大冶铁山矿区是否有新矿藏，曾经在长时间内怀疑过，但是，当他们参照苏联专家的建议，把物理探矿的成果和地质人员的推论结合起来，并进行钻探以后，就发现了巨大的磁铁矿体。
    有些工厂矿山的干部在贯彻执行苏联专家建议方面，有了不少体会。西安矿务局的干部认为贯彻执行苏联专家建议，首先，领导方面必须下定决心，并须在贯彻执行建议的过程中，大力支持职工群众克服困难。其次，必须加强政治思想领导，深入发动群众，教育工人、技术人员、干部克服保守思想与经验主义，真正认识推广苏联先进经验是迅速完成国家建设事业的重要关键。第三，建立与健全必要的制度，克服自流现象，深入检查，保证苏联专家建议的全部贯彻执行。西安矿务局已初步建立并执行了下列制度：1、苏联专家建议手册制度。矿务局领导方面除指定专人负责对苏联专家的建议进行记录整理与检查外，并规定各矿（公司）科的领导人员和主要工程技术人员备专用手册，以记载苏联专家的建议、决定事项和疑问解答等，并据此督促施工单位贯彻执行；2、检查制度。规定各单位的领导人员与主要工程技术人员，必须及时检查执行苏联专家建议的情况；3、汇报制度。规定各单位在苏联专家提出建议三天后，将建议内容整理上报，执行后作出执行情况书面报告，重要建议并抄送党委、工会、青年团，要求共同保证贯彻执行；4、贯彻专责制与交代制度。规定每一建议指定专人负责，限期执行，并须负责将建议向工人群众详细交代。东北第二十一工程公司在全体职工中深入进行了关于贯彻执行苏联专家建议的思想动员，党支部、青年团支部通过黑板报、广播和苏联五年计划图片展览等方式，以及党员、团员大会，小组会，技术人员座谈会等，深入讲解学习苏联先进经验的重要性，通过这些宣传教育工作，打破了部分职工的保守思想，也批判了某些技术人员的资产阶级技术观点。除思想教育外，东北第二十一工程公司也建立了一系列的制度来保证苏联专家建议的贯彻执行。如行政方面规定各队长、场长、股长、工地主任以上的干部，每星期定期根据苏联专家建议检查自己的工作，检查工程计划进度和工程质量；工会方面建立“苏联先进经验学习日”，发动工人把贯彻执行苏联专家的建议订到小组爱国公约和集体合同中去。该公司还建立了苏联专家建议登记簿，规定从翻译人员到场、股、班、组都详细记录苏联专家的意见和在操作中的具体指导，然后组织技术人员综合编成技术教材，发给各班、组讨论。此外，还规定把苏联专家的技术指导作为工人上班前一小时和下班后十五分钟技术学习的主要内容。
    有些工厂矿山在组织领导学习苏联先进经验这一工作中，还有许多严重的缺点。在这些缺点中，主要是一般号召多于具体的组织领导。许多单位没有指定专人负责这项工作，对于贯彻执行苏联专家建议更没有一套办法和必要的制度来保证。根据目前情况，各厂矿在贯彻执行苏联专家建议和推广苏联先进经验方面，最重要的是改变一般化的领导方法，加强具体领导，深入检查，并订出具体计划，指定专人负责和建立必要的制度。
