Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 6th: In view of the fact that the Japanese people's firm opposition to rearmament is seriously hindering the United States and the Yoshida government's ongoing work of rearming Japan, Japanese old militarists, with the support of Japanese Zaibatsu, after nine months of preparation, established a large-scale militaristic organization named "Japan Defense Association" in Tokyo on the 3rd. They attempt to stir up anti-communist sentiment and war mania in Japan, paving the way for large-scale rearmament and the revival of Japanese militarism.

According to Kyodo News Agency, the "Japan Defense Association" announced that it will use huge funds to establish local organizations, and use various propaganda methods to "mobilize public opinion" and "launch a nationwide movement to instill an understanding of the importance of national defense and anti-communism." In addition, the association will also establish investigation and research institutions to "collect information on the military preparations of various countries and communist activities, and support the Security Force and the Police Reserve Force, etc." Kyodo News Agency said: "The scale of this association, its main figures, and financial foundation are different from similar organizations in the past. This is a large-scale organization. It will confront the National Anti-Rearmament Movement, which is mainly composed of workers from the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, and will especially carry out active activities among young people and women."

The main figures of this militaristic organization are all notorious militarists. These include: Kichisaburo Nomura, former admiral of the Japanese Navy who was the Japanese ambassador to the United States when the Pacific War broke out; Teiji Katura, former Japanese minister to the puppet "Manchukuo" and former general of the Army, and others. Ichiro Kiyose, Secretary-General of the Progressive Party, is also a member of this militaristic organization. Representatives of Japanese Zaibatsu, such as Kiyoshi Gō, former president of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Ltd. and current chairman of the "Defense Production Committee," which is called the "command headquarters for promoting rearmament and reviving military demand production," and Ichiro Ishikawa, chairman of the "Federation of Economic Organizations," an organization of Japanese monopoly capitalists, are all sponsors of this organization.

    日本旧军国主义分子
    组织庞大军事机构
    【新华社六日讯】东京消息：鉴于日本人民坚决反对重整军备的意志严重地阻碍着美国和吉田政府正在进行的重新武装日本的工作，日本旧军国主义分子在日本财阀的支持下，经过九个月的筹备，已于三日在东京成立了一个规模庞大的名为“日本防卫协会”的军国主义组织，企图在日本煽起反共情绪和战争狂，为大规模重新武装和复活日本军国主义铺平道路。
    据共同社报道：“日本防卫协会”宣布它将以巨额经费成立地方组织，并利用各种宣传手段，“动员舆论”、“发动全国规模的运动，灌输对国防和反共的重要性的认识”。此外，协会还要设立调查研究机构，“搜集关于各国军备和共产主义活动的资料，扶植保安队和警备队等等”。共同社说：“这个协会的规模、它的主要人物和财政基础都和过去同类的组织不同，这是一个大规模的组织。它将和日本工会总评议会的以工人为主的国民反对重整军备运动相对抗，特别是要对青少年和妇女进行积极活动。”
    这个军国主义组织的主要人物都是臭名远扬的军国主义分子。其中包括：太平洋战争爆发时任日本驻美大使的前海军大将野村吉三郎；前日本驻伪“满洲国”公使、前陆军大将桂定治郎等人。改进党的干事长清濑一郎也是这个军国主义组织的会员。日本财阀的代表人物，如前三菱重工业会社社长、现任被称为“促进重新武装、复兴军需生产的司令部”的“防卫生产委员会”主席的乡古洁、日本垄断资本家的组织“经济团体联合会”会长石川一郎等人，都是这个组织的赞助人。
