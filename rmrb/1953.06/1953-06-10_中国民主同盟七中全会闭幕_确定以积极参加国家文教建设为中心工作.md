Xinhua News Agency, June 9th:

The Seventh Plenary (Enlarged) Session of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League (CDL), lasting thirteen days, victoriously concluded on the 8th. The session summarized the main work of the CDL in the two and a half years since the closing of the Sixth Plenary Session; defined the implementation of this year's three major national tasks, especially active participation in national cultural and educational construction, as the central task of the CDL going forward; revised the League's charter; and elected five additional vice-chairmen of the Central Committee.

The session heard the Central Standing Committee's "Political Report," "League Affairs Report," and "Explanation on the Revision of the League Charter," among other reports, and conducted group discussions on these reports. Speakers at the group sessions and the general assembly unanimously agreed with the content of the above reports and put forward many valuable experiences and opinions on issues such as League affairs, participation in national cultural and educational construction, ideological remolding, and learning from the Soviet Union. During the session, adhering to the principle of proceeding from work, the spirit of criticism and self-criticism was brought into play, and many constructive opinions were put forward on the work of the League and the League's central leadership. A total of thirty-nine proposals were received during the session, which were submitted to the congress by the Proposal Review Committee for approval and were handed over to relevant departments for verification and reference.

The session determined that the China Democratic League is a component of the Chinese People's Democratic United Front and is a new democratic political party of a class alliance nature with petty-bourgeois intellectuals as its main component. The task of the CDL is: under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, to unite and educate intellectuals, mainly petty-bourgeois intellectuals, to consolidate and expand the People's Democratic United Front, to actively participate in people's political activities and the national construction work of new democracy, to thoroughly realize the Common Program, and to advance towards socialism.

Regarding the CDL's future work guidelines, the meeting unanimously agreed that: participation in national cultural and educational construction should be the central task, and League members in national cultural and educational organs should especially actively participate in this central task. All League members should strive to fulfill the country's three major tasks this year in their respective positions. Under the unified leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and administrative organizations at all levels, the League's organizations at all levels should, through the League's ideological education work, help League members and the masses with whom the League is connected to abide by national discipline and do their jobs well; and should also help League members to study Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought on a voluntary basis, and League members in national cultural and educational organs should arm themselves with Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought and conduct self-education and self-remolding. The League's organization must also constantly help League members and the masses with whom the League is connected to seriously learn from the advanced experience and science and technology of the Soviet Union.

The session believes that: in order for the CDL to play its due role in participating in national cultural and educational construction, three major keys must be grasped: First, the League's grass-roots organizations must actively carry out work under the unified leadership of the CCP organizations and administration in their respective organs. Second, the League's leaders at all levels must attach importance to the work of grass-roots organizations, improve and enrich the organizational life of League members, provide specific leadership, supervise and inspect work, and summarize and promote experience. Third, the League's organizations and League members should maintain close ties with the masses with whom the League is connected.

Regarding the CDL's organizational work guidelines, the session believes that: the CDL's organizational work should serve to enable the CDL to better participate in people's political activities and national construction work. The consolidation and development of the CDL's organization should be for the sake of work and proceed from work.

During the session, all attendees and observers participated in a tea party held by the United Front Work Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, and Premier Zhou Enlai of the State Council of the Central People's Government delivered a report at the meeting. The session also invited Minister Li Weihan of the United Front Work Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to give a report, so that everyone had a clearer understanding of the current political situation, the specific tasks of national construction, and the League's central work. The attendees and observers were also invited to participate in receptions hosted by the Higher Education Department of the Central People's Government, the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the All-China Federation of Natural Science Societies, and the All-China Association of Science and Technology Popularization, visited Renmin University of China, Peking University, Tsinghua University, and several middle schools in Beijing, and held a symposium on League affairs.

The session closed on the afternoon of the 8th. At the closing session, the "Resolution of the Seventh Plenary (Enlarged) Session of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League on Various Reports of the Central Standing Committee" was unanimously adopted, as well as the "Resolution of the Seventh Plenary (Enlarged) Session of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League on the Proposal Review Committee's 'Report on the Review of Proposals'," the "Resolution of the Seventh Plenary (Enlarged) Session of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League on Adding Five Vice-Chairmen to the Central Committee to Strengthen the Central Leadership," and the revised "Charter of the China Democratic League." The session finally unanimously passed a telegram of respect to Chairman Mao Zedong, a telegram of respect to the Chinese People's Volunteers, and a telegram of condolence to the families of the martyrs of the CDL.

In order to strengthen the leadership of the CDL Central Committee, and according to the resolutions passed by this session, the session decided to elect five additional vice-chairmen in addition to Chairman Zhang Lan and Vice-Chairman Shen Junru of the CDL Central Committee. Zhang Bojun, Luo Longji, Ma Xulun, Shi Liang, and Gao Chongmin were unanimously elected as vice-chairmen of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League.

In his closing speech, Ma Xulun pointed out that the gains of this session were: full promotion of democracy, strengthening of unity, understanding of the current domestic and international situation, and clarification of the nature, tasks, and current work guidelines of the CDL. Ma Xulun said that the China Democratic League must actively call on League members and the masses with whom the League is connected to make practical efforts to complete the three major tasks of the country this year. Ma Xulun said that the basic task of the CDL is to consolidate and expand the People's Democratic United Front in order to complete the construction of new democracy and advance towards socialism. The CDL must work hard under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, consolidate and develop the organization in its work, and complete the historical tasks of the CDL.
