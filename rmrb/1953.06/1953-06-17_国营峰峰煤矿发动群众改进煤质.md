    The state-owned Fengfeng Coal Mine has launched a mass movement to improve coal quality, and initial results have been achieved.
    A large proportion of the coal produced by the state-owned Fengfeng Coal Mine is supplied to Anshan Iron and Steel Company (Angang). If the quality of the coal is poor, it not only leads to waste in transportation but also directly affects Angang's steel production. Starting last December, under the slogan of "Supporting Angang with Practical Actions," the mine launched a mass movement to improve coal quality. They first worked to unify the thinking of leaders at all levels, then proposed specific measures and established various dedicated organizations. At the end of last year, the mine successively held two coal quality meetings attended by leading cadres from the entire bureau. At the meetings, they criticized erroneous ideas held by some leaders, such as "Poor natural conditions make it impossible to improve quality" and "Picking gangue (waste rock) at the working face is ineffective and affects production." They began to recognize the significant relationship between improving coal quality and national economic construction and people's lives. Subsequently, in January of this year, the "1953 Implementation Measures for Improving Coal Quality Work" were promulgated, proposing various specific measures and establishing dedicated organizations and inspection systems at all levels. Production units in each mine designated specific personnel to inspect the gangue picking situation of workers at each working face underground and at the pithead, as well as the assessment of roof coal seam conditions and gangue content. The inspection results were announced to the workers every day.
    In the work of improving coal quality, Fengfeng Coal Mine fully mobilized the masses of workers. They put forward the slogan of "Three Inspections and Four Prohibitions" (the three inspections are: coal miners, loading workers, and car loaders all participate in inspection; the four prohibitions are: gangue cannot go onto the electric chute, onto the iron shovel, into the mine car, or onto the train), organizing various workers to improve quality from their own work. This call received a response from the masses of workers. They incorporated the requirements for improving quality into the conditions of production competitions and supervised each other, so that improving quality gradually became a conscious action of the masses. The workers of Zhang Qingrong's team at the 210 working face of Mine No. 2 strengthened mutual supervision in their work and improved quality, winning the Coal Quality Excellence Model Award five times in a row. The testing staff also actively participated in the work. They organized workers to study coal washing regulations and went down the pit to check the workers' coal picking.
    Fengfeng Coal Mine has also established many systems to overcome the phenomenon of no one being responsible for quality. These include the gangue picking inspection system, various organizational meeting systems, and quality incentive systems. All these systems that have been well implemented have yielded results. For example, after the establishment of the quality incentive system and the progressive wage system for gangue picking, the workers' morale increased significantly, and the gangue picking rate increased month by month.
    Through the above work, the coal quality of Fengfeng Coal Mine has been initially improved. In the first half of last year, the average gangue content of the coal from Fengfeng Mine No. 2 reached 8 percent. Now it has been reduced to 3.3 percent. In Mine No. 1, the lowest gangue content in April has dropped to 1.6 percent, and the ash content has also generally decreased. From January to April this year, loading workers and gangue pickers alone picked out 7,000 tons of gangue. However, the work of improving coal quality in Fengfeng Coal Mine is not yet consolidated, the degree of mobilizing the masses is not widespread or deep enough, and the trade union has not participated well. Further efforts must be made.

    国营峰峰煤矿发动群众改进煤质
    国营峰峰煤矿开展群众性的改进煤质工作，已收到了初步成效。
    国营峰峰煤矿出产的煤有很多是供给鞍山钢铁公司的。煤的质量如果不好，不仅造成运输上的浪费，而且直接影响鞍钢的钢铁生产。去年十二月开始，该矿在“以实际行动支援鞍钢”的口号下，展开了群众性的改进煤质的工作。他们首先是打通各级领导干部的思想，并提出具体办法，建立各种专职机构。去年底，矿里先后召开了两次全局领导干部参加的煤质会议，会上批判了领导干部中认为“自然条件差，无法改进质量”、“工作面上拣矸不管事，影响生产”等错误思想，开始认识到改进煤的质量对于国家经济建设和人民生活的重大关系。接着在今年一月颁布了“一九五三年提高煤质工作执行办法”，提出了各种具体措施，并建立各级专责机构和检查制度，各矿生产单位都指定专人在坑下井口检查各工作面工人拣碴情况，顶板煤层条件及含碴量的检定，每天把检查结果向工人公布。
    在改进煤质工作中，峰峰煤矿充分发动了工人群众。他们提出了“三检四不上”的口号（三检是：采煤工、撩煤工、装车工都参加检，四不上是：矸石不上电溜子、不上铁铣、不上罐车、不上火车），组织各种工人从本身的工作中来改进质量。这一号召得到了工人群众的响应，他们纷纷把提高质量的要求订入生产竞赛的条件中，相互进行监督，使得改进质量工作逐渐成为群众的自觉行动。二矿二一○掌子面张清荣班的工人，在工作中加强了相互督促，提高了质量，连得了五次煤质优良模范奖。化验工作人员也积极参加了工作，他们组织了工人学习选煤规程，并下坑检查工人的拣煤情况。
    峰峰煤矿还建立了许多制度，以克服质量无人负责的现象。计有检查拣碴制度，各种组织的会议制度、质量奖励制度等。这些制度凡执行得好的都收到了效果，例如质量奖励制度和拣矸累进工资制建立后，工人们情绪显著上升，拣矸率逐月增加。
    经过了以上这些工作，峰峰煤矿煤质已有了初步改善。峰峰二矿去年上半年煤的含矸率平均达百分之八，现在已降低到百分之三点三。一矿四月份含矸最低已降到百分之一点六，灰分也普遍减低。今年一月到四月，仅装车工和拣矸工就拣出了矸石七千吨。但是，峰峰煤矿改进煤质的工作还不够巩固，发动群众的程度还不够普遍深入，工会还没有很好参加，还必须作进一步的努力。
