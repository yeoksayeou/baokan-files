Xinhua News Agency, June 1st—Factories and mines in the North China Iron and Steel Industry System have basically discussed the national production plan. In order to ensure that this year's production plan can be completed in a balanced and comprehensive manner, these units are now continuing to mobilize workers to compile work plans and strengthen dispatching work.

After discussion by the masses of workers, the production plans of these units have generally been revised, and many advanced indicators have emerged. For example, the revised total output value of Tianjin Steel Plant exceeds the national control figure by 16.3 percent, labor productivity increased by 18.5 percent compared with last year, and costs decreased by 7.75 percent compared with last year.

In order to complete this year's production plan in a balanced and comprehensive manner, these units specifically examined the shortcomings in the past implementation of the plan in order to find out the reasons and improve them. In the first quarter of this year, the production plans of these units were not completed satisfactorily. For example, although Tangshan Iron and Steel Plant completed the main product plan in the first quarter, it did not complete the quality indicators and cost plan. The planned output of steel ingots in the first quarter of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant was mainly completed by a crash effort in March. The daily output of the medium-sized rolling mill in the first branch of Tianjin Steel Plant was extremely unbalanced: the highest reached 1,175 percent of the plan, and the lowest accounted for only 1.05 percent of the plan. The production progress of the western mining area of ​​Longyan Iron Mine in the first quarter was also unbalanced: the output in January accounted for only 24 percent of the total quarterly production plan, February accounted for only 25 percent, and March rose to 48 percent. The main reason for this imbalance is the failure to do a good job in planning management, and the first is the lack of practical work plans with a mass foundation. The work plans formulated by these factories and mines in the past have not been discussed by the masses and do not conform to actual conditions. The basic production units and the masses of workers only know the annual, quarterly, or monthly plans in general terms, but they do not know what tasks they should complete every ten days, every week, and every day. Secondly, there is a lack of sound dispatching work, which often hinders the rhythmic progress of production.

After inspection and analysis, the leading cadres of these units further clarified that in order to complete the production plan in a balanced and comprehensive manner, it is necessary to implement planning management, and the important links in implementing planning management are to do a good job in work plans and improve dispatching work. Therefore, starting from May this year, these units, on the basis of discussing the national plan, continued to mobilize the masses of workers to compile work plans and strengthen dispatching work.

After this work started, the leading cadres of various steel plants and mines went to the workshops to publicize the importance of compiling work plans and implementing planning management to the masses of workers. Then they organized various departments and workshops to check the shortcomings in the past work plans and dispatching work. At present, this work is continuing to develop. Among them, Tangshan Iron and Steel Plant has initially determined the methods to improve planning management in the future based on the results of the inspection. These methods are: First, improve the original record system, and require the statistical department to provide correct statistical data, so as to refer to the improvements in production technology in the previous period and find the average advanced quotas as the basis for compiling work plans. Second, fully consider various balancing work to avoid disconnections in production. Third, establish a complete system for the preparation and implementation of work plans, from the plant's overall work plan, the instruction charts of each workshop, to the instruction charts of each shift and group. Fourth, establish a general dispatching office, enrich the planning and dispatching organization of the workshop, strengthen the dispatching force, and give play to the guaranteeing and supervising role of dispatching work on the work plan. Fifth, strengthen the initiative of supply work, and require personnel from the supply department to frequently go into the workshops, and take the initiative to supply raw materials in a timely manner according to the workshop's work plan, so as to ensure the balanced production of the workshop. Tangshan Iron and Steel Plant will mobilize the masses of workers to discuss and prepare the work plan for June according to these new methods.

    抓住计划管理重要的环节
    正发动职工编制作业计划和加强调度工作
    【新华社一日讯】华北区钢铁工业系统的各工厂、矿山已基本上讨论完国家生产计划。为了保证今年的生产计划能够均衡地、全面地完成，现在这些单位正在继续发动职工编制作业计划和加强调度工作。
    这些单位的生产计划，经过职工群众讨论以后，一般地都作了修改，出现了许多先进的指标。例如天津钢厂经过修订后的生产总值超过国家控制数字百分之十六点三，劳动生产率比去年提高百分之十八点五，成本比去年降低百分之七点七五。
    为了均衡地、全面地完成今年的生产计划，这些单位特别检查了过去执行计划中的缺点，以便找出原因，加以改进。今年第一季度中，这些单位的生产计划是完成得不够完满的。例如唐山钢铁厂第一季度虽然完成了主要产品计划，但没有完成质量指标和成本计划。太原钢铁厂第一季度钢锭产量计划，主要是依靠三月份突击完成的。天津钢厂第一分厂中型轧钢机的日产量存在着极不平衡的现象：最高时达到计划的百分之一千一百七十五，最低时只占计划的百分之一点零五。龙烟铁矿西部矿区第一季度的生产进度也是不平衡的：一月份的产量只占全季产量计划的百分之二十四，二月份只占百分之二十五，三月份上升到百分之四十八。造成这种不均衡的主要原因是没有做好计划管理，首先是缺乏切实的有群众基础的作业计划。这些工厂、矿山过去所订的作业计划并未经过群众讨论，不切合实际情况。各基层生产单位和职工群众只笼统地知道全年、全季或全月的计划，可是不知道自己在每旬、每周和每日应该完成什么任务。其次是缺乏健全的调度工作，以致常常妨碍生产的有节奏进行。
    经过检查和分析以后，这些单位的领导干部进一步明确认识了要均衡、全面地完成生产计划，必须实行计划管理，而实行计划管理的重要环节是做好作业计划和健全调度工作。因此从今年五月开始，这些单位在讨论国家计划的基础之上，继续发动职工群众编制作业计划和加强调度工作。
    这一工作开始后，各钢铁厂和矿山的领导干部曾分头深入车间，向职工群众宣传编制作业计划、实行计划管理的重要意义，接着就组织各科室、各车间对过去的作业计划和调度工作中的缺点进行检查。目前这一工作正在继续发展，其中唐山钢铁厂已根据检查结果初步确定了今后改善计划管理的办法。这些办法是：一、健全原始纪录制度，要求统计部门提供正确的统计资料，以便参照前一时期生产技术方面的改进，找出平均先进定额，作为编制作业计划的基础。二、充分考虑各项平衡工作，避免生产中的脱节现象。三、从全厂的作业计划、各车间的指示图表，到每班每组的指示图表，建立一套完整的作业计划的编制执行制度。四、成立总调度室，充实车间计划调度组织，加强调度力量；发挥调度工作对作业计划的保证监督作用。五、加强供应工作的主动性，要求供应部门的人员经常深入车间，根据车间作业计划主动地及时地供应原材料，以保证车间生产的均衡进行。唐山钢铁厂将按照这些新的办法发动职工群众讨论和编制六月份的作业计划。
