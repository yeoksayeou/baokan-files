Since last winter and this spring, rural areas in Southwest China have been carrying out the consolidation of mutual aid and cooperative organizations. This work has now made considerable progress. According to statistics from early April: about 40 percent of the mutual aid and cooperative organizations in Sichuan Province have been consolidated, of which Wenjiang, Nanchong, and Suining prefectures have completed all consolidation work. Leshan and Yibin prefectures have consolidated 60 to 70 percent, and other regions have generally consolidated 20 to 30 percent, with only individual counties not yet starting. The suburban areas of Chongqing Municipality have consolidated 37 percent. Most counties in Guizhou Province have done key consolidation. Thirty-three counties in Yunnan Province have all consolidated a portion. Xikang Province also issued instructions in April to consolidate mutual aid teams in conjunction with spring plowing. Although the consolidation work in various places has developed very unevenly, and the extent to which problems have been solved varies, it has played a certain role in overcoming the impatience and rashness in the mutual aid and cooperation movement and promoting current production.

Over the past six months, various places have gained many experiences and lessons in practical work. Experience has shown that consolidating mutual aid teams must start from solving the problems that most affect unity and production, and must be closely integrated with production, proceeding from production in all aspects. Those who have done so have achieved good results. For example, when Dianzi Township in Jiangjin County, Sichuan Province, carried out consolidation work, it found after publicizing policies that the main problem affecting the unity of mutual aid teams in the township was the failure to implement the policy of mutual benefit: some mutual aid teams had damaged many dragon-bone waterwheels during last year's drought without repairing them, the settlement of labor accounts took too long, and some teams had not yet made up wages. After consolidating based on these situations, other problems were also resolved. The main problem in Chengguan Village, Baiyun Township, Guizhu County, Guizhou Province, during the mutual aid and cooperation movement was impatience and rashness, and blind merging of teams. During consolidation, this problem was first solved, and the large teams that had been forcibly merged were divided into smaller teams again, which everyone was very satisfied with. After the consolidation of mutual aid teams in Bishan County, Sichuan Province, the relatively common phenomenon of low wages and uncompensated use of farm tools was corrected, which stimulated everyone's enthusiasm for mutual aid production. Those who had withdrawn from the mutual aid teams in the past rejoined, and some individual farmers also voluntarily organized themselves. In the process of consolidating mutual aid teams, the Fourth District alone developed twenty-nine new mutual aid teams. Sh膏 Township in Zizhong County, Shanshi Village in Tianchi Township in Yibin County, and others seized the time from after spring sowing to before rice transplanting to carry out consolidation work. During the consolidation, they started by understanding everyone's production situation and soliciting team members' opinions on how to restore mutual aid activities and how to prepare for rice transplanting, focusing on solving the problems of arranging work order and allocating farm tools and labor. In this way, the mutual aid teams that had stopped activities during the slack season were restored during summer production.

However, some areas did the opposite when carrying out work, not starting from the actual problems of the mutual aid teams, but consolidating them based on their own subjective imagination. For example, when S村 in Mengjia Township in Deyang County was consolidating, the cadres subjectively believed that the wages in the mutual aid team were too low, and insisted on raising each work unit to seven and a half jin of rice, which led to the collapse of the mutual aid team. Some mutual aid teams had no problems or minor problems, but the working cadres insisted on consolidating them across the board, which aroused the dissatisfaction of the masses. In the consolidation of Ba Village, Zhima Township in the Fourth District of Zizhong County, production was not integrated, and practical problems were not solved. Three unimportant topics were given to the farmers to answer, resulting in no effective work. Some adopted crude methods of large-scale purging, causing many mutual aid organizations to disintegrate. Some were hasty, such as Xinwu Village in Zunyi County, Guizhou Province, which consolidated fifty mutual aid teams in two nights. Using these wrong methods not only failed to achieve the goal of consolidating and improving mutual aid organizations, but also affected the consolidation of mutual aid teams and the production enthusiasm of the masses.

The reasons for the above shortcomings are, first of all, that cadres are not clear about the policies, principles, and methods of consolidating mutual aid teams, do not understand that consolidating mutual aid teams is a relatively long-term and meticulous work, and have not correctly estimated our current subjective and objective realities, resulting in impatience. Secondly, the ideological boundaries are unclear, and they do not understand that consolidating mutual aid teams is to solve the internal problems of farmers, and persuasive education methods must be used to deal with them, but they mistakenly used many crude methods such as "struggle" and "purge" to deal with problems. This not only did not solve the problem, but also caused disunity among farmers and affected production. These shortcomings and errors must be paid attention to and prevented in future consolidation work.

    西南各地紧密结合生产整理互助组
    部分干部有急躁情绪，采取了粗暴草率的办法，应注意纠正
    去冬今春以来，西南各地农村进行了互助合作组织的整理工作。现在这一工作已作出不少成绩。根据四月上旬的统计材料：四川省的互助合作组织约整理了百分之四十，其中温江、南充、遂宁三个专区已全部整理完毕，乐山、宜宾两个专区整理了百分之六十至七十，其他地区一般地整理了百分之二十至三十，只个别县还没有动手整理。重庆市郊区整理了百分之三十七。贵州省大部分县作了重点整理。云南省三十三个县都整理了一部分。西康省也在四月间发出结合春耕整理互助组的指示。各地的整理工作虽然发展得很不平衡，解决问题的程度也各有不同，但对克服互助合作运动中的急躁冒进思想和做法、推动当前的生产，都起了一定的作用。
    半年多来，各地在实际工作中都取得了不少的经验和教训。经验证明：整理互助组必须从解决最影响团结和生产的问题着手，必须和生产紧密结合起来，一切从生产出发。凡是这样做的都收到了良好的效果。如四川省江津县店子乡在进行整理工作时，经过宣传政策，发现这个乡影响互助组团结的主要问题是没有贯彻互利政策：有些互助组在去年抗旱中用坏了很多龙骨水车没有修补，清工结账时间太长，有的组工资尚未找补等。根据这些情况进行整理后，其他问题都解决了。贵州省贵筑县白云乡程官村在互助合作运动中的主要问题是急躁冒进，盲目并组。整理时，首先解决了这个问题，把勉强合并起来的大组仍分成小组，大家都很满意。四川省璧山县互助组经过整理后，纠正了比较普遍存在的工资偏低和无偿使用农具的现象，激发了大家互助生产的热情，过去退出互助组的又重新加入了，有些单干农民也自愿地组织起来了，仅四区在整理互助组的过程中就新发展了二十九个互助组。资中县石膏乡和宜宾县天池乡山石村等，抓紧春耕播种后到插秧前的一段时间，进行了整理工作。整理时，从了解各人的生产情况和征求组员对如何恢复互助活动及如何准备插秧的意见入手，着重解决了排工先后和农具、劳力的调配等问题。这样，在农闲时停止了活动的互助组，在夏季生产中又恢复起来了。
    有的地区在进行工作时却与上述情况相反，不从互助组的实际问题出发，而是根据自己主观的想像在那里整理。如德阳县孟家乡四村在整理时，干部主观地认为互助组内工资太低，硬要把每个工提高到七斤半米，互助组因此垮了台。有的互助组没有什么问题或问题不大，但工作干部也要一律加以整理，引起群众不满。资中县四区芝麻乡八村，整理中不结合生产，不解决实际问题，出了三个不关痛痒的题目要农民解答，结果工作毫无成效。有的采用大批清洗的粗暴办法，使很多互助组织解体。有的草率从事，如贵州省遵义县新五村，两个晚上就整理了五十个互助组。用这些错误的办法，不仅没有达到巩固与提高互助组织的目的，反而影响了互助组的巩固和群众的生产积极性。
    产生上述缺点的原因，首先是干部对整理互助组的方针、政策、作法不明确，不了解整理互助组是一个比较长期而细致的工作，没有正确估计我们当前的主客观实际情况，产生了急躁情绪。其次是思想界限不清，不了解整理互助组是解决农民内部的问题，必须采用说服教育的方法来处理，而错误地采用了“斗争”、“清洗”等许多粗暴的办法来处理问题。这样不但没有解决问题，反而造成了农民内部不团结的现象，影响了生产。这些缺点和错误，都是在今后的整理工作中必须注意纠正和防止的。
