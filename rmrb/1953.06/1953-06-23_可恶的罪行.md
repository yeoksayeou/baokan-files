    Heinous Crime
    By Ilya Ehrenburg, Soviet Union
    At the last meeting of the World Peace Council, we experienced a moment that no one will ever forget. A Belgian lawyer, a Catholic, stepped onto the stage, his voice trembling with grief and indignation. He announced that a heinous crime had occurred – two innocent people, whom all people of conscience had tried so hard to save, had been murdered in the electric chair. The members of the World Peace Council – Indians and Frenchmen, Russians and Americans, Chinese and Arabs – rose and observed a moment of silence. Just yesterday, everyone believed that if conscience would not stop the murderers, then self-interest would. But the forces of evil have triumphed.
    Everyone knows that the Rosenbergs were innocent. American nuclear energy experts and European jurists, regardless of their political beliefs, said so. The Rosenberg case dragged on for a long time. The innocent couple was sentenced to death, but the execution was delayed again and again. Who knows if this was due to fear or cruelty? The innocent couple was subjected to the most cruel punishment month after month – the torment of anticipated death.
    Millions of men and women have appealed to those who held the Rosenbergs' fate in their hands to stop the executioner's hand. Church figures in Italy and ordinary people in New York, members of parliament in Britain and famous writers from various countries – Thomas Mann, Roger Martin du Gard, Duhamel, Mauriac – pleaded with them. Hélio and the students of Oxford University pleaded with them. Those known for their right-leaning views or agreement with American policies issued appeals to them. The mothers of heroes who sacrificed themselves in the war also made requests to them. All indignant people demanded this. But those who wanted to spread malice, those who tormented innocent people and mocked justice, pretended not to hear.
    The Rosenbergs were honest and brave people. They corresponded with each other while in prison. Anyone who reads these letters cannot help but be moved. They wrote in their letters that they were innocent, and about their two children – one ten years old and the other six. After the Rosenbergs' letters were published, the right-wing pro-American "Le Figaro" wrote: "Only people with great and pure hearts can speak like this."
    Someone tried to tempt them at the last minute: offering them a deal – they could save their lives if they admitted their guilt, making the absurd judges appear justified. They replied: "We are young, we want to live, we want to raise our children, but we cannot tell lies – we are innocent."
    Why were they killed? They were killed to drown the urgent desire for peace in the blood of the innocent, to suppress the desire of the people of all countries, including the American people, to end the era of hatred, lies, and fear. They were killed by those who fear peace. This is not just a crime, it is simply madness.
    When the news of Rosenberg's execution spread around the world, everyone was shocked. Protests shook New York, London, Rome, and Paris. Everyone has a true heart, and no one can coldly watch the innocent be killed.
    The Rosenbergs died because they, like millions of honest people, demanded peace. They died because the war groups needed to find victims, because all the people were elated after the initial agreement was reached in Korea, and because someone on the other side of the ocean still hoped to fool their people, to scare humanity, and to create war.
    No, things will never be as they intended. The blood of two innocent people will unite all those who demand peace more closely. We feel very sorry that the American people were unable to stop this. We know that they, like the people of other countries, are very pained by this despicable act. The Rosenbergs' children will see the realization of the cause for which their parents were martyred – the unity of all mankind, the end of the era of spiritual darkness, and the peace of all mankind. This innocent couple persevered in their long suffering because they were aware of this, and this same understanding will inspire the struggle of the people of all countries for peace.

    可恶的罪行
    苏联  伊里亚·爱伦堡
    在世界和平理事会会议最后一次会上，我们经历了一个谁也永远不会忘记的时刻。一位比利时律师、天主教徒，走上了讲台，他的声音因悲痛的激愤而颤抖着。他宣布说，一件可恶的罪行发生了——一切有良心的人曾极力设法拯救的两个无辜人民被用电椅杀害了。世界和平理事会的理事们——印度人和法国人、俄国人和美国人、中国人和阿拉伯人，都起立默哀，只是在昨天，每个人还都认为，如果良心不会使杀人犯住手，那么自我打算也会使他们住手。但是，恶势力胜利了。
    罗森堡夫妇是无罪的，这一点每个人都知道。美国的有学问的原子能专家和欧洲的法学家，不分他们的政治信仰怎样，也都这样说。罗森堡夫妇的案件拖了很长的时期，这一对无罪的夫妇被判决了死刑，但执行却一拖再拖。谁知道这是由于恐惧还是出于残暴呢？这一对无罪的夫妇一月一月地受着最残酷的刑罚——预料中的死亡——的折磨。
    千千万万的男女都曾吁请罗森堡夫妇命运所系的人停止刽子手的手。意大利的教会人士和纽约的普通人民，英国的议员和各国的名作家——托马斯·曼恩、罗杰·马丁·杜加德、杜阿梅、莫里亚请求他们，赫里欧和牛津大学的学生请求过他们，那些以右倾或同意美国的政策而闻名的人向他们发出过呼吁，那些在战争中牺牲了的英雄们的母亲也向他们提出过请求。一切激愤的人民都这样要求。但是，那些想散布恶毒的人、那些折磨无辜人民和嘲弄正义的人，却装做听不见。
    罗森堡夫妇是正直和勇敢的人。他们在监狱里的时候，曾经彼此通信。谁读到这些信，都不会不为之感动的。他们在信里写到他们是无罪的，写到他们的两个孩子——一个十岁，一个六岁。罗森堡夫妇的信公布之后，右翼亲美的“费加罗报”写道：“只有心地伟大和纯洁的人才能谈得出这样的话。”
    有人曾企图在最后一刻钟诱惑他们：向他们提出一宗交易——只要他们承认他们的罪，让荒谬的法官显得理直气壮，他们就可以保全生命。他们回答说：“我们还年青，我们要活下去，我们要把我们的孩子抚养成人，但是我们不能说谎话——我们是清白无罪的。”
    他们为什么被杀害了呢？杀害他们，是为了用无辜者的血来淹没对和平的迫切愿望，来压制各国人民，包括美国人民在内，要求终止憎恨、谎言和恐惧的年代的愿望。他们是被怕和平的人杀害的。这不单是罪恶，这简直是疯狂。
    当罗森堡被处死的消息传到全世界的时候，每一个人都为之震动。抗议示威震撼了纽约、伦敦、罗马和巴黎。每一个人都有一颗真正的心，没有人能够冷冷地看着无辜者被杀害。
    罗森堡夫妇因为和千千万万正直人民一样要求和平而死去了。他们因为战争集团要找牺牲品，因为在朝鲜取得初步的协议之后所有的人民都欢欣鼓舞，因为大洋彼岸有人仍然希望愚弄他们的人民、恐吓人类、制造战争而死去了。
    不，事情决不会像他们所打算的，两个无罪的人的鲜血将把一切要求和平的人更紧密地团结起来。我们觉得很遗憾，美国人民没有能够制止这件事情。我们知道，他们也和别国人民一样，对于这件卑鄙的行为感到非常痛苦。罗森堡夫妇的孩子将会看到他们的父母殉难的事业的实现——全人类的团结，精神黑暗时代的终止，全人类的和平。这一对清白无罪的夫妇就是意识到这一点而在他们长期的苦难中坚持了下来，同样，这一点认识将会鼓舞各国人民争取和平的斗争。
