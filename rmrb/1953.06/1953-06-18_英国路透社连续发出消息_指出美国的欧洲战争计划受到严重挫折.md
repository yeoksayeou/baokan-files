    British Reuters Continues to Issue News
    Pointing Out That America's European War Plan Has Suffered a Serious Setback
    [Xinhua News Agency, 17th] "The initiative has slipped from the hands of the United States," "the disintegration of the Cold War front," "obstacles to the European Defense Community are increasing," "the differences between Britain and the United States in their attitude towards the Soviet Union seem more difficult to overcome" - these are unfavorable words used by British Reuters in news about the European situation issued continuously on the 14th.
    Reuters correspondent Paul Scott Rankin said in a dispatch from Washington: "Observers believe that recent developments in Western Europe require increasingly urgent attention from the United States. The greatly reduced parliamentary majority of Italian Prime Minister Gasperi's Christian Democratic Party, and the fact that France has not yet formed a government, leaves vast areas of Europe without strong anti-communist leadership. U.S. officials believe that... these developments in Europe seriously threaten the opportunity for Western European countries to ratify and implement the European Defense Community treaty this year."
    On the same day, Reuters reported on comments from several major British newspapers on the same issue. "The Observer" said that recent events seem to have fatally weakened the European Defense Community plan. After citing some events that occurred during "Europe's highly dramatic week," the newspaper said: "What we are now seeing in the situation in Eastern and Western Europe, both in domestic and international politics, indicates the disintegration of the Cold War front." "The Sunday Graphic" published a letter from Rome by its columnist, Crossman, who said: "In Rome, everyone recognizes how terribly fragile and divided Europe is." Regarding the recent Italian elections, he wrote: "No matter who wins the election, the Americans will always lose. Gasperi, who has served as prime minister of Italy's pro-American coalition government since 1948, suffered a major blow, and U.S. Ambassador to Italy Clare Boothe Luce silently witnessed the 'ungrateful' Italians' actions toward her and her puppets."
    In another dispatch from London, Reuters quoted "The Observer" as saying: "The political situation in Europe is becoming increasingly unfavorable to American policies and interests." The dispatch pointed out that the new measures recently taken by Democratic Germany in internal affairs have strengthened the West German desire for German unification and weakened Adenauer's position; coupled with the results of the Italian elections and "the significant increase in the strength of neutral factions in France, all of this has weakened American influence in Europe." The newspaper, in referring to the Soviet Union's recent diplomatic peace steps that have "caused a serious impact" and the deepening of British-American differences, said: "All these developments emphatically illustrate the victory of Malenkov's peace proposals—at least in Western Europe. In particular, there is no greater disappointment and concern than the recognition that obstacles to the European Defense Community are increasing."
    Reuters correspondent Rankin pointed out in the aforementioned Washington dispatch that the United States has been adopting methods of coercion and enticement, but these methods have not only failed but have also been counterproductive. Rankin said: "Dulles threatened this January that unless this treaty (the European Defense Community treaty) is quickly ratified, the United States would have to reconsider its aid program to Europe. ... A committee of the House of Representatives reiterated this threat even more forcefully last week. ... It is generally believed here (Washington) in diplomatic circles that such threats will only weaken the position of pro-American elements in European countries, and will not produce a cooperative response in the legislative bodies of these countries and the voters who elect these bodies. U.S. Ambassador to Italy Luce made the same, but less specific, threat, saying that the United States cannot aid a 'non-democratic' Italy. It is generally believed that this threat did not strengthen Gasperi's party in the recent Italian elections, but rather weakened it."
    When discussing the prospects of the West German Adenauer government, the main reliance of the United States in preparing for a new war in Western Europe, Rankin expressed unease about the possible impact of "East Germany's peaceful, friendly, and reasonable policies" on West German public opinion and the West German elections scheduled for September. He pointed out that despite the obligations assumed by the United States in many agreements unilaterally signed with West Germany to maintain the division of Germany, "in the minds of German voters, a unified Germany is their primary goal."
    Rankin then summarized the conclusion of "some observers" in Washington, saying that after Eisenhower delivered his much-publicized speech on April 16, which supposedly allowed the United States to seize the initiative, "America's policies in recent weeks have once again caused this initiative to slip from the hands of the United States."

    英国路透社连续发出消息
    指出美国的欧洲战争计划受到严重挫折
    【新华社十七日讯】“主动权从美国手中溜走了”，“冷战战线的瓦解”，“欧洲防务集团的障碍正在日益增加”，“英美两国在对待苏联的态度上的分歧似乎更加难于克服了”，这些是在十四日一天里面，英国的路透社连续发出的关于欧洲局势的消息中所用的对美国不妙的字句。
    路透社记者保罗·斯各特·兰金从华盛顿发出的一条消息说：“观察家认为：最近西欧情况的发展，需要美国方面愈来愈迫切的注意。意大利总理加斯贝利的天主教民主党的议会多数席大大减少，法国到现在还没有组成政府，这使得欧洲广大地区没有任何坚强的反共领导。美国官员认为：……欧洲这些发展严重地威胁到西欧各国在今年内批准和实施欧洲防务集团条约的机会。”
    路透社同日报道了英国一些主要报纸关于同一问题的评论。“观察家报”说，最近发生的事件似已致命地削弱了欧洲防务集团计划。该报举出“欧洲高度戏剧性的一周”中所发生的一些事件之后说：“我们现在所看到的东欧与西欧的局势，不论在国内政治和国际政治方面，都表示冷战战线的瓦解。”“星期日画报”刊载该报专栏作家克罗斯曼寄自罗马的信说：“在罗马，每个人都认识到欧洲陷于何等可怕的脆弱和分裂状态。”他就最近举行的意大利选举写道：“不管甚么人竞选成功，美国人总是失败了。一九四八年以来就担任意大利亲美联合政府总理的加斯贝利遭到重大打击，美国驻意大利大使克莱尔·布思·卢斯夫人看到‘不感恩的’意大利人对她和她的傀儡所做的事情默不作声。”
    路透社在另一则伦敦电中引“观察家”的意见说：“欧洲的政治局面越来越不利于美国的政策和利益。”该电指出，民主德国最近在内政方面采取的新措施，加强了西德方面要求德国统一的愿望，削弱了阿登纳的地位；加上意大利选举结果和“法国的中立派势力的显著增加，这一切都削弱了美国在欧洲的势力”。该报在说到苏联最近在外交上采取的和平步骤“引起了严重的影响”及英美分歧加深之后说：“所有这些发展都着重地说明了马林科夫的和平建议的胜利——至少是在西欧。特别是，再没有比人们认识到欧洲防务集团的障碍正在日益增加而引起的那种失望与忧虑更为严重的了。”
    路透社记者兰金在前述华盛顿电中指出，美国一直采取威逼利诱的方法，但是这种办法不但已经失灵而且效果适得其反。兰金说：“杜勒斯今年一月曾经要挟说：除非这个条约（欧洲防务集团条约）迅速得到批准，不然，美国就要重新考虑它对欧洲的援助计划。……众议院的一个委员会在上星期又以更加强硬的方式，重新提出这个要挟。……此间
    （华盛顿）外交界人士普遍认为，这种威胁只会削弱欧洲各国中亲美分子的地位，而不会在这些国家的立法机构以及选出这些机构的选民中产生合作的反应。美国驻意大利大使卢斯夫人提出了同样的、但是措词不那么具体的要挟，她说，美国不能援助一个‘非民主’的意大利。一般认为：这个要挟在这次意大利选举中不但没有加强，反而削弱了加斯贝利党的地位。”
    谈到美国在西欧准备新战争的主要依靠西德阿登纳政府的前途时，兰金对“东德采取的和平、友好和讲理的政策”对西德舆论和定于九月间举行的西德选举可能发生的影响表示不安。他指出：尽管美国承担了许多和西德片面签订的保持德国分裂的协定的义务，但是“在德国选民心目中，统一德国是他们的首要目标”。
    兰金于是总括华盛顿“某些观察家”的结论说，在艾森豪威尔发表他四月十六日那篇被大肆宣传所谓使美国夺得了主动权的演说以后，“美国最近几星期中的政策又使这个主动权从美国手中溜走了”。
