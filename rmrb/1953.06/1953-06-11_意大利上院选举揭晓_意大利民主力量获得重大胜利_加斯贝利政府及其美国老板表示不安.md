Xinhua News Agency, Rome, June 10th: The first results of Italy's second post-war general election show that Italian democratic forces have made great progress in the past five years, while the ruling Christian Democratic Party and its "allies," the Republican Party, the Liberal Party, and the Social Democratic Party, have suffered a shameful defeat.

The already announced results of the Senate election show that the Communist Party and the Socialist Party have achieved significant victories. The two parties together won 34.7% of the total votes. In the last general election in 1948, their share of the vote was 30%. On the other hand, despite the Christian Democratic Party's adoption of various violent and fraudulent methods, the so-called "coalition" of government parties suffered a disastrous drop in total votes from approximately 57% of the total in the last general election (Christian Democratic Party plus Social Democratic Party and Republican Party) to 48.7% (Christian Democratic Party plus Social Democratic Party, Republican Party, and Liberal Party). This "coalition" relied on the Christian Democratic Party's co-opting of three small parties, including the South Tyrol People's Party and the Sardinian Action Party (which together won 1.5% of the votes), to barely exceed a majority (50.2%) for the so-called government party "coalition." The other two right-wing opposition parties, the Monarchist Party and the "Italian Social Movement," together won 13.2% of the votes.

In the approximately 24.3 million votes cast in the Senate election, the Communist Party and the Socialist Party together won nearly 8.5 million votes, an increase of more than 1.7 million votes compared to the last general election.

The distribution of Senate seats had not been fully revealed as of the evening of June 9th. Statistics from approximately half of the Senate electoral districts show that the government "coalition" has lost 18 seats, while the Communist Party and the Socialist Party have gained 7 seats. The allocation of Senate seats does not apply to the provision that the party coalition that obtains a majority of votes can receive an additional 15% "bonus seats," which was forcibly passed by the Gasperi government in parliament.

The results of the House of Representatives have not yet been fully revealed. However, the results of the Senate election have already caused strong unease among government officials, because more than two million young voters aged 21 to 24 are participating in the House of Representatives election, and government officials fear that their votes will make the results even more unfavorable to the government "coalition."

The American bosses of the Italian government have already been unable to hide their disappointment. When reporting the results of the Senate election, the Associated Press said on June 9th: The rising strength of the opposition parties "today undermined Gasperi's hope of producing a pro-Western parliamentary majority capable of ratifying the European Army plan and maintaining Italy's close alliance with the West."

After the Senate election results showed unfavorable to the government "coalition," the government immediately increased the number of fully armed military police guarding the Ministry of Interior building, where the vote counting was taking place. "Unità" issued a warning, pointing out that the government was taking cheating measures to falsify the election results.

    意大利上院选举揭晓
    意大利民主力量获得重大胜利
    加斯贝利政府及其美国老板表示不安
    【新华社十日讯】罗马消息：意大利战后第二次大选的第一个结果显示，意大利民主力量五年来获得了巨大的发展，而执政的天主教民主党及其“同盟者”共和党、自由党和社会民主党遭到了可耻的失败。
    已经揭晓的上院选举结果表明，共产党和社会党得到重大胜利。两党得票共占总数百分之三十四点七，在一九四八年上次大选中，它们得票的比重是百分之三十。另一方面，尽管天主教民主党采取了各种暴力和欺诈的办法，但是所谓政府党派的“联盟”共得票数却从上次大选中占总数约百分之五十七（天主教民主党加社会民主党和共和党）惨跌至百分之四十八点七（天主教民主党加社会民主党、共和党及自由党）。这个“联盟”依靠天主教民主党拉拢了三个小党派包括南蒂罗尔人民党和撒丁行动党（它们总共获得百分之一点五的票数），才使所谓政府党派“联盟”勉强得以超过半数（百分之五十点二）。另外两个右翼的反对党派保皇党和
    “意大利社会运动”共得票百分之十三点二。
    在上院选举的约计二千四百三十万票中，共产党和社会党共得票近八百五十万，比上次大选增多了一百七十多万票。
    上院议席的分配截九日晚尚未完全揭晓。大约半数上院选举区的统计显示，政府“联盟”已失去十八席，共产党和社会党增加了七席。上院席位的分配不适用加斯贝利政府在议会强行通过的、获得过半数票的党派联盟就可获得额外的百分之十五“奖励席”的规定。
    下院的结果还没有完全揭晓。但是上院选举的结果已在政府人士中引起强烈的不安，因为另有二百多万从二十一岁到二十四岁的青年选民参加下院选举，政府人士担心他们的票将使结果对政府“联盟”更加不利。
    意大利政府的美国老板已经掩不住他们的失望。美联社九日在报道上院选举结果的消息时说：反对党派“力量的高涨今天破坏了加斯贝利的希望，加斯贝利曾希望产生一个亲西方的议会多数，能够批准欧洲军计划，并保持意大利与西方的紧密联盟”。
    上院选举结果显示对政府“联盟”不利之后，政府立即增派大批全副武装的军警守卫正在里面进行计票的内政部大厦。“团结报”发出警告，指出政府正采取作弊办法以假造选举结果。
