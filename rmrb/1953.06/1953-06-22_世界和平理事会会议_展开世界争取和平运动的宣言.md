Xinhua News Agency, June 21st dispatch from Budapest: The World Peace Council meeting unanimously adopted a declaration on launching a world movement for peace. The full text is as follows:

	Recent developments have convinced the people of all countries that a peaceful settlement of all international differences is possible.

	The people of all countries know that peace can be achieved through their persistent actions.

	The World Peace Council, meeting in Budapest from June 15 to 20, calls on the people of the world to redouble their efforts to facilitate consultations for the peaceful resolution of outstanding international issues.

	Every country has the right to freely choose its way of life and must also respect the freedom of other countries to choose their way of life.

	In this way, the peaceful coexistence of various systems that everyone needs is possible, and the relations between the people of all countries will be mutually beneficial.

	This coexistence means that all conflicts and disputes should be resolved through consultation.

	The Korean armistice is the prelude to peace. A Korean armistice agreement must be signed immediately on the basis of the agreements already reached. Further delays will cause more sorrow, destruction and suffering. Similarly, other wars and acts of aggression currently being waged against the independence of various countries must also be stopped. Using force to suppress any national liberation movement will only fuel international tensions and create a hotbed of war.

	The German people have the right to reunify their motherland and obtain national sovereignty, while respecting the security of their neighbors and preventing the revival of militarism and the spirit of revenge.

	Japan must restore full national sovereignty on the basis of a peace treaty that is recognized by all relevant countries and guarantees the security of the people of Asia and the Pacific.

	If the people of all countries ensure that their sovereignty is respected, oppose foreign interference in their way of life, and fight against the establishment of military bases and the occupation of any foreign troops, they will be able to guarantee their security and ensure that peace is maintained.

	Gradually establishing security will make it possible to halt the arms race, begin disarmament through consultation, and use the resources hitherto used for destruction and death to improve the living standards of all people.

	Economic and cultural exchanges between all countries must be established on an equal footing, without discrimination, and with due regard to the interests of all countries.

	Consultation will change the course of events. The United Nations can promote this consultation as long as it remains true to the spirit of the United Nations Charter. The United Nations must admit all countries applying for membership. China, like other countries, must be represented in the United Nations by the government it has chosen.

	For these reasons, the World Peace Council has decided to launch a broad international movement for consultation. In this movement, the people of all countries will express, in various organized forms, their desire to see all international disputes and conflicts resolved peacefully.

	Only through continuous action by the people can consultation, agreement and peace be achieved.

### 世界和平理事会会议  展开世界争取和平运动的宣言

    世界和平理事会会议
    展开世界争取和平运动的宣言
    【新华社二十一日讯】据塔斯社布达佩斯讯：世界和平理事会会议一致通过展开世界争取和平运动的宣言，全文如下：
    最近几个月的局势发展使各国人民深信，和平解决所有的国际分歧是可能的。
    各国人民都知道，和平是能够通过他们的坚持不懈的行动获得的。
    从六月十五日到二十日在布达佩斯举行会议的世界和平理事会号召全世界人民加倍努力，促成协商以和平解决争执不决的国际问题。
    每一个国家有权利自由选择它的生活方式，同时也必须尊重其他国家自由选择的生活方式。
    这样，大家需要的各种制度的和平共处才有可能，各国人民之间的关系才是互利的关系。
    这种共处意味着所有的冲突和争端应该通过协商来解决。
    朝鲜停战是和平的序幕。必须在已经达成的协议的基础上立即签订朝鲜停战协定。更多的拖延就会引起更多的悲哀、破坏和痛苦。同样的，现在正在进行的、反对各国人民独立的其他战争和侵略行动也必须加以制止。使用武力压制任何民族解放运动，只会助长国际局势的紧张，并造成战争的温床。
    德国人民一方面有重新统一祖国和获得国家主权的权利，同时要尊重他们邻国的安全，防止军国主义和报复精神的复活。
    日本必须在一个为所有有关国家承认的、并保证亚洲和太平洋各国人民安全的和约的基础上恢复全部国家主权。
    如果各国人民确使他们的主权受到尊重，反对外国干涉他们的生活方式，为反对建立军事基地和任何外国军队的占领而斗争，他们就能够保证他们的安全，确使和平得到维护。
    逐步建立起安全，就会使制止军备竞赛、通过协商来开始裁减军备、并把迄今被用于破坏与死亡的资源用来提高所有人民的生活水平成为可能。
    必须在平等基础上建立所有国家间的经济与文化交流，不得有所歧视，并要顾及所有国家的利益。
    协商会改变事态发展的道路。联合国只要忠实于联合国宪章的精神，就能促进这种协商。联合国必须接纳所有申请加入联合国的国家。中国也像其他国家一样，必须由它所选择的政府在联合国中作代表。
    为了这些原因，世界和平理事会决定发动一个广泛的国际争取协商的运动。在这个运动中，各国人民将以各种各样的、有组织的形式表示他们愿看到一切国际争端与纠纷得到和平解决的要求。
    唯有人民通过不断的行动才能使协商、协议与和平得到实现。
