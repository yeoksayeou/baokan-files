Xinhua News Agency, Prague, June 27th: The Czechoslovak Political and Scientific Knowledge Popularization Association and the Czechoslovak State Film Studio jointly held a gathering in Prague on the 24th. The Czechoslovak Republic film artists delegation, which participated in the "Czechoslovak Republic Film Week" held in various parts of China in April this year, reported on their impressions of their visit to China.

    Dr. Miroslav Fabera, head of the delegation, said: The modesty, politeness, diligence, and bravery of the Chinese people left the deepest impression on us. The enthusiasm of the entire Chinese people for labor makes one deeply believe that the new China under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong will rapidly become a powerful industrial country.

    Lieutenant Colonel Ludvík Ševčík, Director of the Army Film Studio, introduced the grand occasion of the "May Day" parade in Beijing to the audience. He also cited examples of the heroic life of the famous Czech revolutionary and writer Julius Fučík and its inspirational effect on the soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army.

He also described the sincere expressions of the Chinese people's love for the Czechoslovak people that they witnessed during their visit to China.
