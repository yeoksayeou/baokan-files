    Reasons for the Fall of the Mayer Cabinet
    Soviet Union Lasa Jin
    The Mayer cabinet is not the first French cabinet to fall during parliamentary discussions on the state of national finances. Prior to this, a series of cabinets headed by Pleven, Faure, and Pinay had also suffered the same fate at such times. The point of contention was not the fiscal plan itself, but the foreign and domestic policies pursued by the French ruling group, which were clearly reflected in the national budget.
    The Mayer cabinet lasted only four months, from January 8 to May 21. Such short-lived cabinets have long ceased to surprise French public opinion. For example, the Faure cabinet existed for a total of forty days. There was even a cabinet whose life was only... forty-eight hours.
    The frequent changes of cabinets are not accidental in France. As the French democratic press pointed out, the reason for the downfall of successive cabinets is that they inherited the policies implemented by their predecessors that were contrary to the fundamental interests of the French nation.
    In view of the current cabinet crisis, many French newspapers analyzed the political line followed by the Mayer cabinet.
    In France, it is well known that former Prime Minister Mayer was an enthusiastic supporter of the Atlantic bloc and the notorious "European Army." During Mayer's tenure, France was forced to undertake new obligations in the arms race. This determined the further militarization of the national budget.
    As many political figures in France have pointed out, the Mayer cabinet continued the harmful and hopeless war in Vietnam. This war consumes more than 600 billion francs from the French treasury every year. Therefore, it is not accidental that the deficit in the French national budget is as high as 800 billion francs.
    If we also take into account France's foreign trade deficit, rising prices, and the devaluation of the franc, then the disastrous state of French finances is very obvious.
    Continuing to pursue the policies of the Atlantic bloc and waging the Indochina War are the focus of the French government's foreign policy. But this policy does not have the support of the people. Members of parliament have to take this into account.
    The Mayer cabinet submitted the "European Army Treaty" bill to parliament for approval. However, French public opinion correctly saw this treaty as a guise for reviving the German fascist army, and they expressed strong opposition. Not long ago, the parliamentary foreign affairs committee deliberately decided to postpone the discussion and approval of the "European Army" treaty. At the same time, the foreign affairs committee also passed a resolution requesting a four-power conference to resolve major international issues through consultation.
    Whether in the press or in parliament, the call to stop the Indochina War is rising. Progressive parliamentarian Pierre Cot emphasized in a speech to the National Assembly on May 19 that it would be impossible to improve France's financial situation without stopping the Vietnam War. Pierre Cot said: "Public opinion is clear about this, but government officials are far from it..."
    "Liberation" wrote on May 20: "Most French people believe that as long as France continues to bear the heavy burden of the Indochina War and the expansion of armaments, it will be fundamentally impossible to carry out economic, financial and political recovery."
    "Liberation" continued: "This adventure has continued for several years, France is bankrupt, and has lost patience. Now is the time to end it..."
    Recently, what has particularly dissatisfied the public is France's lack of independence in its foreign policy. The Mayer government completely relies on dollar handouts to determine its policies.
    Parliamentarian Fochier severely criticized the government's policy at the parliamentary meeting on May 19. By the way, Fochier belongs to the government's majority group in parliament. He said to Mayer:
    "You go to Washington to kneel like a beggar!"
    Therefore, the fall of the Mayer cabinet signifies the bankruptcy of the French ruling group's foreign policy. As for the domestic policies of the previous cabinet, they also did not receive the support of the majority of the people.
    If the financial bill drafted by the Mayer government is passed, it will not eliminate France's financial difficulties, but will only increase the burden on the French working people. The "savings" mentioned in the bill drafted by the government are in fact further cuts in already extremely tight civilian projects, and are to make the working people bear more indirect taxes. Bourgeois members of parliament had to take into account the mood of the voters, and therefore voted against the government.
    A prominent fact during the Mayer cabinet's tenure was the continuous growth of the strike movement. The working people opposed the high cost of living, demanding increased wages and improved working conditions, and the scale of this struggle is expanding.
    A recent issue of "Prospects" weekly said: "The rapid development of the social movement is unexpected. It has created an environment that is increasingly similar to 1936... The increase in the cost of living has caused such a powerful strike movement, and its development in the country is the same as in 1936."
    The Mayer government's response to this increasingly rising democratic movement and workers' movement was political repression. The famous leaders of the French General Confederation of Labor were arrested and persecuted. André Stil, editor-in-chief of "Humanité," was imprisoned. The parliamentary privileges enjoyed by communist parliamentarians continue to be violated. The Mayer government took various measures to suppress the strike movement of Renault factory workers and dockworkers.
    Mayer asked parliament to grant the government "special powers" to prohibit the strike movement. The Mayer government attempted to make some reactionary amendments to the French constitution, thereby further fascistizing the French political system.
    It is worth noting that Mayer had recruited the well-known traitor and executioner of French patriots, Butmi, into his government, and it was only due to the firm opposition of broad sections of society that Butmi was driven out of the French cabinet.
    At present, the democratic forces in France have proven themselves to be sufficiently strong to resist the attacks of the reactionaries. This was clearly demonstrated in both the recent national municipal elections and the parliamentary elections in the Seine province. Broad sections of voters have expressed their trust in the French Communist Party, because it is a party that defends peace, democracy, progress and national independence.
    Finally, it should be explained the configuration of French parliamentary forces related to the cabinet crisis.
    The government's majority group in parliament is mainly composed of the Catholic "Popular Republican Movement," the so-called "Independents," the Radical Socialist Party, and the vast majority of the Gaullists.
    The Communist parliamentary group in parliament defends the independence of the French nation and firmly opposes the reactionary policies of the Mayer government. The members of the right-wing Socialist Party have also recently become opposition. The leaders of the right-wing Socialist Party, fearing that their influence among the workers would be completely lost, pretended to criticize the policies of the Mayer government, but at the same time, they consistently obstructed the work of the French working people to establish a unified organization to change the current domestic and foreign policies of France.
    As for the members of the Gaullist French People's Rally, they even believed that the reactionary Mayer cabinet was "not strong enough" in suppressing the French democratic movement. As "Le Figaro" pointed out, the French People's Rally promoted the cabinet crisis in order to make it possible for them to participate in the next cabinet.
    Currently, the President of the Republic is holding consultations with leading figures in French politics and representatives of parliamentary groups. The editorial of "Liberation" on May 22 reflects the concerns of the entire French public opinion. The newspaper asked: "What is to be done now? Is it just another change of cabinet, while the current policies remain the same?" There is no doubt that the majority of the French people hope to change France's policies so that they are conducive to peace and to domestic economic and social improvement, and to national independence.

            May 22, Paris.

    迈耶内阁倒台的原因
    苏联  拉萨金
    迈耶内阁已经不是在议会讨论国家财政状况时倒台的第一个法国内阁。在此以前，以普利文、富尔、比内为首的一系列内阁也都在这种时候遭到了同样的命运。争执的问题并不在于这个或那个财政方案的本身，而在于法国统治集团所奉行的对外和对内政策，这种政策明显地表现在国家预算上。
    迈耶内阁从一月八日到五月二十一日，只维持了四个多月。这样的短命内阁早已不再使法国舆论界感到惊奇了。例如，富尔内阁总共存在了四十天。还有过一个内阁，它的生命只有……四十八小时。
    这种内阁的频繁更换在法国并不是偶然的。正如法国民主报刊所指出的，历届内阁倒台的原因都是由于继承了前任内阁所实行的和法国民族根本利益相违背的政策。
    鉴于当前的内阁危机，法国许多报刊分析了迈耶内阁所遵循的政治路线。
    在法国，人们都知道，前任总理迈耶乃是大西洋集团和恶名昭彰的“欧洲军”的热烈拥护者。在迈耶执政期间，法国在军备竞赛方面被迫承担了新的义务。这就决定了国家预算的进一步军事化。
    正如法国许多政治界人士所指出，迈耶内阁在越南继续进行了有害而无望的战争。这个战争每年从法国国库中消耗掉六千亿法郎以上。因此，法国国家预算的赤字高达八千亿法郎，就不是偶然的了。
    如果再估计到法国的对外贸易逆差，物价上涨，和法郎贬值，那末法国财政上的灾难景况就很明显了。
    继续奉行大西洋集团的政策和进行印度支那战争，是法国政府对外政策的重心。但是这种政策得不到人民的支持。议会议员们不得不估计到这一点。
    迈耶内阁曾把“欧洲军条约”的法案提交议会批准。但是法国舆论界正确地看出这个条约是复活德国法西斯军队的幌子，他们表示强烈反对。不久以前，议会外交委员会故意决定延期讨论批准“欧洲军”条约。同时外交委员会并通过决议，要求举行四国会议，以便用协商方式解决国际间的重大问题。
    不论在报刊上或者在议会中，反对继续进行印度支那战争的呼声日益高涨。进步议员皮尔·戈特于五月十九日在国会演说时强调指出，如果不停止越南战争，法国财政状况的改善是不可能的。皮尔·戈特说：“舆论界都明了这一点，然而政府官员们却和它相距很远……。”
    五月二十日的“解放报”写道：“大多数法国人都相信：只要法国继续担负印度支那战争和扩张军备的沉重负担，那就根本不可能来进行经济、财政和政治的恢复工作。”
    “解放报”接着说：“这种冒险迄今已继续了好几年，法国破产了，并且丧失了耐性。现在已经到了让它结束的时候了……。”
    最近以来特别使公众不满的是法国在对外政策中缺乏独立精神。迈耶政府完全依靠美元施舍来决定它的政策。
    议员弗希纳尔在议会五月十九日举行的会议上严厉地批评了政府的政策。顺便提一下，弗希纳尔是属于议会中政府多数集团的。他向迈耶说：
    “你到华盛顿去，是为了像叫化子一样地屈膝！”
    因此，迈耶内阁的倒台意味着法国统治集团对外政策的破产。至于前届内阁的对内政策也同样没有获得大多数人民的支持。
    如果通过迈耶政府起草的财政法案，那决不会消除法国的财政困难，而只会在法国劳动人民身上加重负担。政府起草的法案中所谈到的“节约”，事实上是把已经极度紧缩的民用项目再加以削减，是使劳动人民负担更多的间接税。资产阶级议员不得不考虑到选民的情绪，因此投票反对政府。
    迈耶内阁执政期间的突出事实是罢工运动的不断增长。劳动人民反对生活费用的高涨，要求增加工资和改善工作条件，这个斗争的规模愈来愈扩大了。
    最近一期的“展望”周刊说：“社会运动发展之迅速实出人意外。它已经创造了越来越和一九三六年相类似的环境……生活费用的增加引起了这样强大的罢工运动，它在国内的发展情况和一九三六年一样。”
    对于这种日趋高涨的民主运动和工人运动，迈耶政府的对策是政治镇压。法国总工会的著名领袖被逮捕并遭到迫害。“人道报”总编辑安德烈·斯梯被关进监狱。共产党议员们所享有的议员特权继续受到侵犯。迈耶政府采取了种种措施，用来镇压雷诺工厂工人和码头工人的罢工运动。
    迈耶要求议会赋予政府“特别权力”以禁止罢工运动。迈耶政府试图对法国宪法作一些反动的修改，从而使法国的政治制度进一步法西斯化。
    值得注意的是，迈耶曾把人所周知的叛国分子、法国爱国人民的刽子手布特米收罗在他的政府内，仅仅是由于广大阶层社会人士的坚决反对，布特米才被赶出法国的内阁。
    目前法国的民主力量证明本身是充分地强大，足以抵抗反动派的进攻。无论在最近全国举行的市政选举中和塞纳省的议会选举中，都清楚地表明了这一点。广大阶层的选民都对法国共产党表示信任，因为它是维护和平、民主、进步和民族独立的政党。
    最后应该说明的是和内阁危机有关的法国议会力量的配置情况。
    议会内的政府多数集团主要是由天主教“人民共和党”、所谓“独立派”、激进社会党和绝大多数的戴高乐分子组成的。
    议会内的共产党党团维护法国民族的独立，坚决反对迈耶政府的反动政策。右翼社会党的议员们最近也变成了反对派。右翼社会党的头子们因为害怕自己在工人中间的影响丧失净尽，于是对迈耶政府的政策装模作样地进行批评，但与此同时，他们却一贯地阻挠法国劳动人民为改变目前法国的对内对外政策而建立统一组织的工作。
    至于戴高乐派的法兰西人民联盟的议员们，他们甚至认为反动的迈耶内阁在镇压法国民主运动方面
    “还不够有力”。正如“费加罗报”所指出的，法兰西人民联盟促进内阁危机，是为了使自己有可能参加下届内阁。
    目前共和国总统正向法国政治方面的领袖人物和议会党团的代表们进行商谈。五月二十二日“解放报”的社论反映了法国整个舆论界所深切关怀的问题。该报问道：“现在要怎么办呢？是否是再更换
    一次内阁，而现在的政策却原封不动？”毫无疑问，大多数法国人民希望改变法国的政策，使它有利于和平以及本国经济和社会方面的改进，使它有利于民族的独立。
            五月二十二日，于巴黎。
