Preliminary Experience in Establishing a Scheduling Responsibility System
Li Ganzhong, He Fuben

The First Engineering Company of the Nonferrous Metals Industry Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Heavy Industry had sixteen construction sites last year. The construction sites were very scattered, making it difficult for leaders to grasp the construction situation in a timely manner. Often, one place was busy while another was idle; one place had plenty of materials while another lacked them. The company's supply department did not understand the technical materials and project progress of each site, and therefore could not rationally use materials, nor could it guarantee the timely supply of materials required for the project. For example, the Gongda construction site had three million extra bricks, which other sites needed very much, but the materials department did not know if these bricks could be transferred. Similar situations of not being able to uniformly grasp the situation and uniformly command not only existed in terms of technical supply, but also in various construction sites, where phenomena such as work stoppage waiting for drawings, disjointed processes, and uncoordinated work types were also common.

In order to change this situation, an engineering command room was established at that time. However, the command room could not foresee the situation and prevent accidents. This year, we studied the Soviet scheduling system and decided to try it out. Therefore, we transferred more than ten people, including engineers, construction site directors, technicians, and statisticians, to form a scheduling office, formulate systems, collect data, and begin to implement the project scheduling system in a prepared manner.

Clarify the Role of the Scheduling Responsibility System

The task of the scheduling organization in engineering management is to supervise and regulate project progress to ensure the completion and surpassing of the national plan in terms of quantity and time limit. The scheduling system in engineering is the responsibility of the scheduler, who uses communication and technical tools to conduct centralized scheduling and supervision of construction operations based on the approved monthly, ten-day, and day-and-night operation charts and construction plans. Before we implemented the scheduling system, all cadres did not clearly understand the nature and role of the scheduling system. There were various incorrect views. We repeatedly criticized these incorrect views and explained to everyone: We have already generally formulated monthly and ten-day operation plans last year, compiled instruction charts, had dedicated scheduling personnel, a relatively sound statistical system, and also had telephones and dedicated personnel responsible for communication. We already have the conditions for implementing the scheduling system. At the same time, it was explained that the implementation of the scheduling system cannot be perfect all at once, and experience should be accumulated in the work and gradually improved. The scheduling system is to handle affairs according to plans and systems, not to solve all problems, and in fact it cannot solve them. After this explanation, the cadres began to clarify the nature and role of the scheduling system.

The Implementation of the Scheduling Responsibility System Must Be Based on Plans

If the implementation of the scheduling system is not based on plans, it will not only be impossible to foresee and eliminate work stoppages and other accidents in construction, but will also create more confusion. In this way, the scheduling system will lose its due role. Therefore, the following points should be clearly understood:

1. Due to the characteristics of construction, as well as climate change, insufficient design considerations, etc., changes in plans often occur, and the plans and budgets we currently compile are not very complete; therefore, the situation of supply disconnection and process imbalance cannot be completely avoided, especially it is impossible to completely foresee the events of a season or month before the quarter or month. Therefore, plans are not without changes in the process of execution, and the scheduling organization needs to carry out necessary work. At the same time, when things happen that require additional labor and materials outside the plan, or the construction period must be delayed, it must be approved by the manager in advance; in this way, the manager can be fully responsible for completing the national construction plan. It is now determined to schedule on a daily basis according to the ten-day operation plan. If the change in the construction period is within the scope of the monthly operation plan, the scheduling organization can make a decision directly. If labor and materials are within the plan, but it is known that there is a surplus, the scheduling organization can directly exercise the scheduling power to make up for the deficiencies in other places. In order to ensure the construction of key projects, the scheduling power can also be directly exercised to temporarily suspend other projects due to the mobilization of technical resources without affecting the completion of the plan. In the process of scheduling, changes in technical supply plans and production plans of affiliated enterprises will inevitably be caused. These changes should completely depend on the changes in the construction progress plan. If the changes in labor and materials are caused by incomplete planning, budget omissions, or temporary situations, in general, they should be approved according to certain procedures, and then executed through the scheduling organization; but in order to cope with emergencies, the scheduling organization can schedule first when there is no time to go through certain procedures; but a report must be made to the manager afterwards to complete the procedures.

2. When scheduling technical materials, it is best to use special materials for special purposes. For example, if the second construction site contracts two projects of different parties, and the materials are reserved by Party A, then there is no need to schedule; if emergency use is required and borrowing is necessary, it is best to solve it through a joint meeting of Party A and Party B. If it is self-reserved and commonly used local building materials, then it can and should be scheduled. As for labor, tools, and equipment, of course, they can also be scheduled, and the materials of several projects belonging to one party can also be scheduled. Some people advocate scheduling according to sub-item projects, which will make the scheduling system almost ineffective in regulating and supervising.

3. The scheduling work will be easier if the operation plan is compiled correctly. It should not be thought that with the scheduling system, the operation plan can be less precise, and the budget can be sloppy. On the contrary, the scheduling system itself is to promote and supervise the correct compilation of the operation plan. At present, when compiling the ten-day operation plan, the first construction site still only calculates the project quantity according to the drawings, and does not conduct on-site surveys; when compiling the material usage table, it still uses the quota set by the ministry instead of based on its own specific situation. For example, for the earthwork of eight column bases, the plan is only 1,100 cubic meters, but the actual excavation is 1,300 cubic meters. The increase in labor and tools, and the delay in the construction period caused by this are difficult for the scheduling office to grasp. The scheduling organization has statistics on the execution of the plan every day. The "Daily Report Chart" currently made by the statistical team of the construction site is controlled by the scheduling organization, and the statistical team does the summary work. The scheduling organization reports the progress to the statistics section in ten-day and monthly intervals. This division is neither repetitive nor convenient for work.

Establish a Scheduling Organization and a Scheduling Network

The organization for implementing the scheduling system is the establishment of a general scheduling office in the company, with the deputy manager in charge of construction serving as the director, and the engineer serving as the dedicated deputy director. Underneath are the implementation planning group and the record statistics group; if there is day and night construction, a dedicated duty scheduling director is set up. Part-time schedulers are set up in the technical supply departments such as materials, tools, machinery, transportation, and labor wages, and are directly scheduled by the schedulers of their immediate superiors. The general scheduling office cannot schedule across levels to avoid disrupting the scheduling system. At the directly affiliated construction site, the construction site director in charge of planning serves as the scheduling director, and the various technical supply functional groups serve as schedulers; the scheduling director can set up one or two statistical recorders according to the size of the construction site to assist the scheduling director in his work. After the scheduling order of the general scheduling office reaches the technical supply departments and the construction sites, it must be strictly implemented. The technical supply departments of the company cannot directly issue scheduling orders to the technical supply groups of the construction sites to avoid undermining the principle of regional responsibility. Such a scheduling network is attached to the administrative organizational system.

Some construction sites hope that the general scheduling office will send a scheduling resident to be stationed at the construction site to discover and solve problems in a timely manner, which is not correct. Because sending someone else to live on the construction site cannot understand the situation as well as the construction site director, and therefore cannot perform the scheduling duties well, and it will also damage the scheduling network. The construction site director must serve as the scheduling director, responsible for the implementation of the scheduling system of the entire construction site, and cannot rely on others. In this way, the construction site director can understand the problems in the construction in a timely manner and complete the engineering tasks well.

Carry out Scheduling Work Predictively and Quickly

To make scheduling predictive, it is necessary to master certain data. The system that we initially drafted required a lot of data, and we asked for all the forms from the various departments. The scheduling office seemed to have become a data warehouse. In fact, so much data is not only unnecessary, but it is also impossible to read it all. Our experience is that the so-called certain data should include all statistical data that can judge the construction progress of the entire project and each project section at any time, and the data of materials and supplies and means of production that will be shipped recently. With this data, it is enough.

In order to facilitate the work at the beginning, we chose the most important materials, machinery, and tools for scheduling in the current project, and then gradually increased them. However, it should not be a matter of everything, big and small, all scheduled by the scheduler.

To quickly exert the role of scheduling, there must also be communication tools to make scheduling flexible. The on-site scheduling station should be located on the construction site, use the radio to conduct necessary command of the site, and frequently contact various groups and the company's scheduling office through the telephone. These tasks are completely feasible and necessary at present.

    初步建立调度责任制的体会
    李干忠  何富本
    重工业部有色金属工业管理局第一工程公司去年有十六个工地，施工现场很分散，领导上难于及时掌握施工情况，常常是这里忙，那里闲，这里材料多，那里却缺料。公司的供应部门不了解各个现场的技术物资和工程进度，因而不能合理地运用物资，不能保证按时供应工程所需要的材料。如工大工地多了三百万块砖，别的工地很需要，但材料科不知道这批砖能不能调。类似这种不能统一掌握情况和统一指挥的事情，不仅在技术供应方面存在，而且在各个工地上，停工待图、各个工序不能衔接、各个工种不协调等混乱、脱节现象也是普遍存在的。
    为了改变这种情况，当时曾成立了工程指挥室，但是，指挥室不能有预见性地掌握情况和防范事故。今年，我们学习了苏联的调度制，决心试行。于是便抽调了工程师、工地主任、技术员、统计员等十余人成立了调度室，拟订制度，搜集资料，开始有准备地实行工程调度制。
    明确调度责任制的作用
    工程管理中调度机构的任务在于监督及调节工程进度，以保证在数量上、期限上完成并超过国家计划；工程中的调度制是由调度员负专责，借助通讯与技术工具，根据已批准的月、旬、昼夜作业指示图和施工计划，对施工作集中的调度和监督。我们实行调度制之前，所有干部对调度制的性质和作用没有认识清楚。有各种不正确的看法。我们反复地批判了这些不正确的看法，对大家说明：我们去年已普遍制订了月、旬作业计划，编制了指示图表，有了专责的调度人员，统计制度比较健全，也有电话和专门负责通讯联系的人，已经具备了实行调度制的条件。同时也说明：实行调度制，不可能一下子就搞得十全十美，应在工作中积累经验，逐步改进。调度制是按计划按制度办事，不是一切问题都要它去解决，而且事实上它也解决不了。经过这样的解释之后，干部们才开始明确了调度制的性质和作用。
    调度责任制的实施必须以计划为依据
    调度制的实施，如不以计划为依据，则不仅不可能有预见地消除施工中的停工及其他事故，反而会造成更多的混乱现象。这样，调度制便会失去其应有的作用。因此对下列几点应有明确的认识：
    1、由于施工的特点，以及气候变化、设计考虑不周到等等，往往会引起计划的变更，而且目前我们编制的计划预算也还不是很完备的；因此，供应脱节、工序失调的情况就不可能完全避免，特别是在季度、月度以前就要完全预见到一季一月的事，是不可能的。所以，计划在执行过程中不是没有变动的，需要调度机构来进行必要的工作。同时，当发生计划以外需要增加工料的事情，或工期必须拖后时，则必须事先经过经理批准；这样，经理才能负起全面完成国家建设计划的责任。现在确定以旬作业计划分日来调度，若工期变动是在月作业计划范围以内，可以迳由调度机构做出决定。工料在计划以内，但确知其有多余时，调度机构可直接行使调度权力，以补其他地方的不足。为了保证重点工程的施工，因调动技术资源而使其他工程暂时停工而又不影响计划完成时，也可直接行使调度权力。在进行调度过程中，必然引起技术供应计划、附属企业生产计划的变动，这些变动应该完全依从于施工进度计划的变动。如果是计划不周、预算漏项或临时情况所引起的工料变动，一般的说，应按一定手续经过批准，然后通过调度机构执行；但为了应付紧急情况，在来不及办理一定手续时，可以先由调度机构调度；但事后必须报告经理补办手续。
    2、在调度技术物资时，最好是专料专用。如二工地承包了两个不同甲方的工程，而且材料是由甲方储备的，这就可以不进行调度；假如需用紧急，必须借用时，最好是通过甲、乙双方联席会议来解决。如果是自己储备的而又可以共用的地方建筑材料，则可以而且应该调度。至于劳动力、工具设备，当然也可以调度，属于一个甲方的几个工程的材料也可以调度。有人主张按分部分项工程调度，那就会使调度制几乎不起调节与监督的作用了。
    3、作业计划编制得正确，调度工作就好进行。不应该认为有了调度制，作业计划就可以不要求很精确，预算就可以马马虎虎。反过来讲，调度制本身就是要促进并监督正确地编制作业计划。目前一工地在编制旬作业计划时仍只按图计算工程量，而不到现场勘测；编材料使用表时，仍用部订的定额而不根据自己的具体情况。如八个柱基的土方，计划只一千一百立方公尺，实际挖了一千三百立方公尺。像这样所引起的劳动力、工具的增加，工期的拖后，就很难由调度室来掌握了。调度机构每日有计划执行情况的统计，工地的统计组现在做的“每日汇报图表”就归调度机构掌握，而由统计组做汇总工作。调度机构分旬、分月将进度情况报告统计科，这样划分，既不重复又便于工作。
    建立调度组织和调度网
    执行调度制的机构，是在公司成立总调度室，由管施工的副经理兼主任，工程师任专责副主任，下面分实施计划组、记录统计组；如有昼夜施工时，另设专责值班调度主任。在材料、工具、机械、运输、劳动工资科等技术供应部门设兼职调度员，直接受直属上级调度员的调度。总调度室不能越级调度，以免打乱调度系统。在直属工地由负责计划的工地主任兼调度长，各技术供应职能组分任调度员；调度长根据工地的大小，可设一、二名统计记录员，辅助调度长工作。总调度室的调度命令到达技术供应各科及各工地以后，必须严格执行。公司技术供应各科不能直接向工地的技术供应各组下达调度命令，以免破坏区域责任制的原则。这样构成的一个调度网，是依附于行政组织系统内的。
    有的工地希望总调度室派调度驻在员常驻工地，以便发现问题及时解决，这是不对的。因为另外派人住工地，不可能像工地主任那样了解情况，因而也不可能很好地执行调度职务，并且也会破坏调度网。工地主任必须担任调度长，负责全工地调度制的实施，不能依赖他人，这样，工地主任才能及时了解施工中的问题，很好地完成工程任务。
    有预见地迅速地进行调度工作
    要使调度有预见性，必须掌握一定的资料。我们开始草拟的制度中规定要的资料很多，把各科的表册都要来了，调度室好像成了资料库。事实上那样多的资料不但没有必要，就是看也看不完。我们的体会，所谓一定的资料，应该包括每时每刻可以判断整个工程和每个工程地段的施工进度的一切统计资料，和最近将运到的材料物资和生产手段的资料。有了这些资料就够了。
    为了开始时工作方便，我们选择目前工程中最主要的材料、机械、工具加以调度，然后再逐步增加。但也不能事无分巨细，统统都由调度员调度。
    要迅速发挥调度的作用，还必须要有通讯工具，才能使调度灵活。现场的调度站应该设在施工现场，通过广播机对现场进行必需的指挥，通过电话机与各组和公司调度室经常取得联系，这些工作，在目前是完全可以办得到的，而且也是必要的。
