    The North China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee convened its third conference on handling letters and visits from the people in mid-May. The conference summarized past experiences and held full discussions on how to further strengthen this work in the future.
    Since the North China Bureau convened its second conference on handling letters and visits from the people on March 2, new developments have taken place in the handling of letters and visits from the people throughout the North China region. The number of letters and visits from the people in various regions has greatly increased compared to the past. The General Office of the North China Bureau received and processed an average of 20 letters per day in January and February of this year, which increased to more than 30 letters per day after April. The General Office of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the CPC received a total of 461 letters in the entire year of 1952, and 480 letters this spring alone. According to incomplete statistics, leading organs at and above the county level in Hebei Province have received nearly 30,000 letters from the people this spring. These letters include not only those sent directly by the people but also some from Party and government organs and cadres at all levels.
    The range of issues involved in the content of the people's letters in various regions has also expanded compared to the past. In the past, the letters from the people mainly reflected rural issues, but now the number of issues involving leading organs, factories and mines, schools, hospitals, and cities has greatly increased. In the past, there were more criticisms and reports against district and village cadres, but now criticisms and reports against cadres at and above the county level have also increased. In the first quarter of this year, the Tangshan Special District of Hebei Province received five reports from the masses exposing county-level leading cadres for violating laws and discipline and engaging in bureaucracy. In the past, there were few constructive suggestions in the letters, but now this situation has also changed. For example, the Committee of the CPC in Xingtai County, Hebei Province, recently wrote to the editor of the North China Bureau's Party journal, reflecting that many unreformed landlord elements and bad elements had infiltrated our factories, mines, enterprises, and organs through personal connections, causing great dissatisfaction among the masses. The letter suggested to the leading organs that they prohibit private employment and rectify the organization.
    The work of handling letters from the people in various regions has also become more serious and timely than before. More than 70 percent of the nearly 30,000 letters from the people received in Hebei Province this spring have been processed. As a result of earnest handling, the local leading organs have received more letters and visits from the people, while the number of cases transferred from higher levels has relatively decreased. For example, after the Hebei Provincial Committee of the CPC vigorously handled the case of Niu Luolian in Taidi Village violating laws and discipline and achieved results, the number of letters received from the people in the first quarter of this year exceeded the total number for the entire year last year, while the number transferred from the CPC Central Committee and the North China Bureau decreased by 60 percent compared to last year. In addition to focusing on handling typical cases, some mayors and county heads have stipulated a system of regularly meeting with the masses, and some places have also adopted methods such as handling cases through various meetings (especially people's representative meetings), clearing up backlog cases in order, and cadres going to the countryside with files to investigate and handle cases in conjunction with central tasks. The masses are very satisfied, and the leading cadres also feel that their work is more effective than in the past.
    The conference pointed out that the above achievements show that the work of earnestly handling letters and visits from the people has had a new and positive impact among the masses. Therefore, the people place greater expectations and trust in the Communist Party and the People's Government, and the relationship between the Party and the government and the people is closer. However, various regions must not be complacent and proud because of this. They must regard the earnest handling of letters from the people and cadres as an important front for carrying out the struggle against bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of laws and discipline. In particular, they must follow Chairman Mao's instructions and regard it as "a method for the Communist Party and the People's Government to strengthen their ties with the people," and always pay attention to maintaining and expanding this connection, consolidating the achievements, and further strengthening this work on the existing basis to make it a regularized system.
    The conference also emphasized that due to the continuous improvement of the Communist Party's prestige and the people's awareness, and the further deepening of various tasks, the number of issues raised in the people's letters and visits will increase, and the scope will be wider. Therefore, leading Party and government organs at and above the county level should continue to selectively and emphatically handle a number of typical cases with educational significance, especially at the county level; further improve the handling system; and improve the division of labor and liaison methods between various departments, such as regular joint office work by relevant departments, so as to concentrate forces and handle cases in a timely manner.
    The conference criticized the phenomenon that some leading organs unilaterally put forward subjective requirements such as "investigating and handling within a time limit" and "reporting within a time limit" when transferring cases to lower levels without analyzing the situation, causing difficulties for lower levels to handle the cases, and believed that this must be corrected.
    The conference pointed out that at present, most of the people's letters and visits expose rural problems, but there are also many actual problems in industrial and mining enterprises and cultural, educational, and health departments. The leading organs in various regions should try to strengthen their ties with the workers and staff of factories and mines, open up work in this area, and promptly summarize experiences.
    The conference believes that the cadres who handle letters and visits from the people should have a considerable level of policy understanding and more social knowledge, and be able to closely contact the masses and find a set of working methods in their work. Therefore, Party committees at all levels above the county level should strengthen the education of these cadres, let them participate in necessary meetings, help them summarize experiences, and study their work, so that they can become experts in their work.

    中共中央华北局
    召开第三次处理人民来信、来访工作会议
    中共中央华北局在五月中旬召开了讨论处理人民来信与接见人民群众来访工作的第三次会议。会议总结了过去的经验，并对今后如何继续加强此项工作作了充分的讨论。
    自华北局在三月二日召开讨论处理人民来信和来访工作的第二次会议以来，人民来信、来访工作在华北全区又有新的发展。各地人民来信、来访数量较前大为增加。华北局办公厅今年一、二月份平均每日收到和处理来信二十件，四月份以后每日就增加到三十件以上。中共河北省委员会办公厅一九五二年全年共收到来信四百六十一件，今年春季即收到四百八十件。据不完全统计，河北省县以上各级领导机关，今春收到人民来信已近三万件。这些来信除了由人民群众直接寄来的以外，还包括一部分各级党政机关和干部的来信。
    各地人民来信的内容所涉及的问题的范围也较前扩大。过去人民来信中反映的农村问题较多，现在涉及领导机关、工厂矿山、学校、医院、城市等方面的问题大为增加。过去批评和检举区、村干部的较多，现在对县以上干部的批评、检举也增多了。河北省唐山专区今年第一季度内，群众检举县级负责干部违法乱纪、官僚主义的就有五起。过去来信中建设性的意见较少，现在这种情况也有改变。如中共河北省行唐县委员会最近向华北局的党刊编辑来信，反映农村中不少未经改造的地主分子和坏分子经过私人关系钻入我工厂矿山、企业、机关，群众甚为不满，来信向领导机关提出了禁止私自用人和清理组织的意见。
    各地处理人民来信的工作也较前更加认真、及时。河北省各地今年春季收到的近三万件人民来信，已处理了百分之七十以上。由于认真处理的结果，使当地领导机关收到的人民来信和来访者更为增多，上级转下去的案件则相对减少。如中共河北省委自大张旗鼓地处理了台底村牛洛连违法乱纪案件获得成效后，今年第一季度收到的人民来信数已超过去年一年的总数，而其中由中共中央和华北局转下去的却比去年减少了百分之六十。各地除突出地抓紧典型事件进行处理外，有的市长、县长规定了定期接见群众的制度，有些地方还采取了通过各种会议（特别是人民代表会议）处理案件、排队清理积案、干部携卷下乡结合中心工作调查处理等办法，群众十分满意，领导干部也感到工作比过去更有办法了。
    会议指出：以上这些成绩，说明认真处理人民来信、来访的工作，已在群众中发生了新的良好影响，因此人民群众对共产党和人民政府寄以更大的期望和信任，党和政府同人民群众的关系更加密切。但各地决不可因此自满骄傲，必须把认真处理人民和干部来信看作是开展反官僚主义、反命令主义、反违法乱纪斗争的一条重要战线，尤其要遵照毛主席的指示，把它看作是“共产党和人民政府加强和人民联系的一种方法”，时时注意保持和扩大这种联系，巩固既得成绩，并在现有基础上进一步加强此项工作，使之成为经常化的制度。
    会议又着重指出：由于共产党的威信和群众觉悟的不断提高，各方面工作进一步深入，人民来信、来访中所提出的问题将会增多，范围将会更广。因此，县以上党政领导机关，应继续有选择有重点地处理若干富有教育意义的典型案件，尤其是县一级更需抓紧这一点；进一步健全处理制度；改善各部门的分工与联系办法，如有关部门定期联合办公等，以使力量集中，处理及时。
    会议对有些领导机关向下级转办案件时，不分析情况地一律提出“限期查处”“限期上报”的主观要求，造成下级处理困难的现象，作了批判，认为必须加以纠正。
    会议指出：目前人民来信、来访中，以揭发农村问题为最多，但工矿企业、文教卫生部门实际存在的问题也是不少的；各地领导机关应设法加强与工厂、矿山职工的联系，开辟这一方面的工作，并及时总结经验。
    会议认为：处理人民来信、来访工作的干部，应有相当的政策水平和较多的社会知识，并能密切联系群众，在工作中摸出一套工作方法来。因此，县以上各级党委应加强对这些干部的教育，让他们参加必要的会议，帮助他们总结经验，研究业务，使他们成为工作中的内行。    （新华社）
