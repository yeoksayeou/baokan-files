Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 15th: A unit of the Chinese People's Volunteers, amidst battles and work, actively helped the people of Tieyuan, Pingkang and other places in Korea to complete their spring planting tasks in a timely manner.

Certain areas of Tieyuan County and Pingkang County are close to the front line and are subjected to bombing by enemy aircraft and artillery day and night, which has affected the smooth completion of spring planting by local residents. A unit of the Chinese People's Volunteers, in coordination with the local Korean People's Government, drew up a plan and began to help local residents with spring planting in an organized manner from the beginning of April.

Chinese People's Volunteers commanders and fighters showed a high degree of enthusiasm for labor in spring planting. They filled in the bomb craters densely scattered in the fields, removed a large number of cluster bombs dropped by enemy aircraft in the fields, transported fertilizer to the fields, and loosened the soil with tools used for digging fortifications. Two seven-mile-long canals in the Getianli and Jinguli areas of Pingkang County were severely damaged by enemy aircraft and artillery fire. Commanders and fighters of a unit of the Chinese People's Volunteers organized emergency repair teams to work day and night, enabling more than 2,400 mu of farmland in these two villages to be irrigated in time. More than 700 commanders and fighters of a unit of the Chinese People's Volunteers on the Shangganling front also helped farmers in Xiashongguanli, Pingkang County, to dig a canal more than 100 meters long. In the month of April alone, they helped the Korean people cultivate more than 130 mu of land, sow more than 260 mu of land, repair more than 14,000 meters of canals, build 13 dikes, plant more than 210,000 trees, and help residents build more than 20 houses.

While helping the Korean people with spring planting, the Chinese People's Volunteers also organized a large number of medical personnel to go to various villages to treat Korean farmers. A unit of the Chinese People's Volunteers on the Shangganling front recently vaccinated more than 18,000 Korean people and treated those who were sick.

Chinese People's Volunteers commanders and fighters also saved a large amount of food to relieve Korean farmers who lacked food, and helped them overcome the difficulties of farm tools and seeds. Pingkang County alone received more than 100,000 jin of relief grain and more than 1,000 jin of seeds donated by the Volunteers.

With the active help of the Chinese People's Volunteers, the Korean people demonstrated a high degree of enthusiasm for production. Although the people of Tieyuan County, which is on the front line, suffered from the enemy's frenzied destruction, they still completed the spring sowing task two weeks ahead of schedule.

The Korean people are deeply grateful for the help given to them by the Chinese People's Volunteers. When Chinese People's Volunteers commanders and fighters were cultivating in the fields, Korean elders and children came to deliver water and food, and primary school students also came to the fields to perform慰问 performances.

    志愿军某部帮助朝鲜铁原等地人民进行春耕
    【新华社朝鲜前线十五日电】朝鲜中线中国人民志愿军某部在战斗和工作的空隙中，积极帮助铁原、平康等地的朝鲜人民及时完成了春耕生产任务。
    铁原郡和平康郡的某些地区紧靠着火线，日夜经受着敌机和敌炮的轰击，这些灾害影响到当地居民春耕生产任务的顺利完成。中国人民志愿军某部就配合当地朝鲜人民政府作出计划，从四月上旬开始，有组织地帮助当地居民春耕。
    中国人民志愿军指挥员和战斗员们在春耕生产中表现了高度的劳动热情。他们填平了密布在田里的弹坑，排除了敌机投在田野里的大批子母弹，并且把肥料送到田里，又用挖工事用的工具把地刨松。平康郡葛田里、金谷里一带两条七里长的水渠，在敌机和敌炮的轰击下受到了严重的破坏。志愿军某部的指挥员和战斗员们就组织抢修队日夜进行抢修，使这两个里（村）的两千四百多亩农田及时得到了灌溉。上甘岭前线志愿军某部的七百多个指挥员和战斗员也帮助平康郡下松馆里的农民挖通了一条一百多公尺长的水渠。在四月份一个月中，他们共帮助朝鲜人民耕地一百三十多亩，播种二百六十多亩，修水渠一万四千多公尺，修水堤十三条，植树二十一万多株，并且帮助居民盖房子二十多间。
    在帮助朝鲜人民进行春耕生产时，志愿军部队还组织了大批医疗人员分赴各村为朝鲜农民治病。上甘岭前线的志愿军某部最近就给一万八千多个朝鲜人民注射了防疫针，并且对有病的人进行了治疗。
    中国人民志愿军指挥员和战斗员们还节约了大批粮食救济缺乏粮食的朝鲜农民，并帮助他们克服农具和籽种的困难。仅平康郡一地就得到志愿军捐助的救济粮十多万斤和籽种一千多斤。
    在中国人民志愿军的积极帮助下，朝鲜人民发挥了高度的生产热情。处在火线上的铁原郡人民虽然遭到了敌人的疯狂破坏，但仍提前两周完成了春耕播种任务。
    朝鲜人民对中国人民志愿军给予他们的帮助深为感谢。当志愿军指挥员和战斗员们在田里耕作时，朝鲜老人和儿童都赶来送水送饭，小学生们也赶到田里进行慰问演出。
