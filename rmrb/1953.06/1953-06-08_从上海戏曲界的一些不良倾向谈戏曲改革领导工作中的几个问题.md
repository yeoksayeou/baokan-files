    On Some Problems in the Leadership of Opera Reform Work, Based on Some Undesirable Tendencies in Shanghai's Opera Scene
    Zhong Luo
    For a relatively long period, some undesirable tendencies have existed in Shanghai's opera scene. Due to weaknesses in the leadership of Shanghai's opera reform work, these undesirable tendencies have not been thoroughly overcome.
    These undesirable tendencies are first manifested in the extremely unserious attitude towards the heritage of national opera. The leading organization of Shanghai's opera reform work once seriously and cautiously handled several popular traditional repertoires for performance by state-owned troupes, but this correct attitude did not have the due impact on the broader opera scene. Most private troupes and Pingtan (storytelling) circles have consistently displayed a philistine attitude towards the national heritage. Especially after the National Opera Festival, they used the guise of "national heritage" to bring out feudal and erotic content, such as "He Wenxiu," "Three Smiles," "Yang Naiwu and Xiao Baicai," and even "Visiting the Underworld," which had been explicitly ordered to be discontinued by the central government. They even openly said: "Local authorities have no right to ban performances. By the time you get central approval, after a long delay, we will have already made our money." Some excellent programs from the National Opera Festival were also arbitrarily altered by philistine elements in Shanghai. They suddenly rushed to perform "Autumn River" and then "Butterfly Cup," wantonly ruining the national heritage as a money-making tool. Fearing that short plays would not be popular, they forcibly added all sorts of messy things, stretching them to three and a half hours.
    The second manifestation of undesirable tendencies is the development of the past tendency to compete for novelty and innovation, using bizarre plots or so-called "exoticism" to attract audiences. Shanghai Opera and Yue Opera both staged "Desert Love Song," adapted from the novel "Fifteenth Moon" (by Hai Mo), while the original work had serious errors in ethnic and religious policies. Shanghai Opera also very unseriously staged the Japanese play "Mother, Woman." Yue Opera's "Stealing the Moon from the Jade Palace" boasted a "historical costume palace mega-production," rendering bizarre love "legends"; the vulgarization of performance advertisements is even more widespread.
    The third manifestation of undesirable tendencies is formalism, gimmickry, and vulgar "Shanghai style" in performance. Stage machinery, glittering costumes, shiny nickel-plated props, and flickering red and green lights are becoming increasingly prevalent. In order to cater to the low tastes of the petty bourgeoisie, and for the sake of "box office value," even zombies have been brought onto the stage. Yue Opera's "Yutangchun" uses two scenes to render the "luxurious scenes" of a brothel. Some Pingtan artists have added many vulgar and erotic elements when performing old stories. This bad practice is extremely destructive to art and a waste of the national opera heritage.
    These undesirable tendencies have been around for a long time. Some of Shanghai's main opera genres are entirely products of a semi-feudal and semi-colonial society, while others, although originating from rural areas, have long been steeped in the petty-bourgeois low tastes and the decadent toxins of bourgeois formalism under the influence of imperialist decadent art commodities, losing their original simple content and form. During the long years before liberation, these genres abandoned their excellent old repertoires and traditional artistic methods. This inevitably led to the deterioration of the ideological content and performance techniques of these genres day by day.
    In addition to this historical reason, the emergence of these undesirable tendencies also has its social causes. Following the people's growing need for cultural life, the number of theaters and performance troupes in Shanghai is increasing daily. The low tastes of the petty bourgeoisie give the backward repertoires a market. To date, according to incomplete statistics, there are 28 opera genres in Shanghai, with 10 major genres (with more audiences). There are 168 large, medium, and small-sized troupes; opera performers, including mobile and a small number of unemployed, total 8,300. Most of these troupes and performers are distributed in nearly 200 theaters and storytelling houses, and they come into contact with more than 100,000 audience members every day (not including those listening to broadcasts on the radio).
    This complex and deformed situation, with such a large number, such an unhealthy innate condition, and such a widespread influence, has made the task of opera reform in Shanghai arduous, and also illustrates the importance of ideological leadership in this work. Facts increasingly prove that opera art is an important part of the cultural life of the broad masses of the people. This must be given sufficient consideration. Can we allow so many "Nine Beauties Pictures" and "Ten Beauties Pictures," so many feudal and erotic toxins, to be instilled into the masses through the stage and radio? Can we allow these things to erode the workers, peasants, and young students who make up 50 percent of the audience every moment? Judging from some programs of the recent Shanghai Workers' Literary and Art Festival, the above-mentioned undesirable tendencies have spread to the simple and healthy workers' literary and art activities like a plague. This phenomenon can no longer be ignored.
    The leading organization of Shanghai's opera reform work has made great efforts. These efforts have yielded many achievements, but this does not mean that the fundamental problems of the opera scene have been solved. The neglect of ideological leadership by the leading organization of opera reform work is the main reason why the above-mentioned undesirable tendencies have not been thoroughly overcome. In the ideological leadership work of Shanghai's opera reform, the following issues should be further noted and resolved.
    Strengthening Regular Artistic Ideological Leadership
    On the opera and art front, ensuring the unshakable leading position of the working class ideology and fighting against all kinds of anti-people ideas should be a regular work, not a temporary one. Facing the rampant feudal and philistine toxins, the leadership of Shanghai's opera reform work has struggled. But these struggles are not frequent enough and not serious enough. They have failed to seize some important events and favorable conditions to carry out artistic ideological leadership in a timely manner.
    For example, the National Opera Festival is a major event in the national opera scene, and should become an important driving force for further implementing the opera reform policy and conducting artistic ideological leadership. In fact, it has indeed had a good impact on the state-owned troupes in East China and Shanghai that participated in the festival. However, this favorable condition has not been fully utilized. The entire opera scene has not been organized and led to conduct in-depth rather than superficial learning in accordance with the spirit and requirements of the festival, and in combination with the actual situation of Shanghai's opera scene. Even the cadres of opera reform work have not studied it seriously and systematically. The performances of the Northeast and Central South delegations in Shanghai only passed by in a flurry because of the leadership's relaxation.
    For example, Shanghai's opera reform work has also had many relatively good experiences, such as the creation of Pingtan's "Must Build the Huai River Well" and "Maritime Hero," the adaptation and performance of Shanghai Opera's "Luo Han Qian," and the sorting out of some old and excellent repertoires and the performance of new plays by Huai Opera, which have also had a good impact on the opera scene and the broad audience. It should be said that these are important events in Shanghai's opera reform work. However, the leadership failed to summarize the experience and promote it in a timely manner, so that those good influences could not be further expanded and deepened.
    For example, the leadership is clear about the increasingly serious undesirable tendencies in the repertoire and performances of private troupes since the second half of last year, and the speculative style in dealing with national heritage after the National Opera Festival, but the main cadres have been trapped in bureaucratic and campaign-style work, and have not been able to spare time. It was not until before the Spring Festival this year that several symposiums were convened to conduct criticism and self-criticism, and initially stopped the development of chaotic phenomena. On the other hand, some bad dramas that have appeared in Shanghai's opera scene in the past, such as the vaudeville "Living Bodhisattva," which peddled low tastes under the banner of "suppressing counter-revolutionaries," and the Yue Opera "Lord Xinling," which was a serious anti-historicalism, were not only not strictly criticized, but were instead rewarded. Although this matter has been going on for a long time, its impact has not passed all at once. Vaudeville is still intensifying its sale of low and vulgar tastes, and anti-historicalism tendencies are still everywhere in scripts with historical themes.
    The facts are already very clear. If the regular artistic ideological leadership is relaxed or even abandoned, and the irreconcilable struggle with all anti-people literary and art ideas is relaxed or even abandoned at every moment, then, objectively, the development of undesirable tendencies will inevitably be condoned.
    Seriously Resolve the Script Issue
    The main link in the opera reform work is the script issue. Without scripts, there is no opera. Whether more than 100,000 audiences receive good education or bad education every day, the decisive factor lies in the script. If state-owned troupes have relatively good scripts, they can regularly maintain the quality of performances, thus becoming an important base for conducting revolutionary education for the people. The habitual commercial style of private troupes is extremely unserious in dealing with the script issue. New plays are changed every few days, and playwrights have to produce them roughly and hastily, patching them together; they swarm together, grabbing scripts, and even going to typing agencies to steal other people's scripts, change their appearance, and regard them as their own creations. In this case, many scripts are no longer works of art that infect people in terms of moral quality, but vulgar commodities. This situation shows that if the leadership of opera reform work can grasp this link, it will also grasp the main problem. However, on this issue, the leadership of Shanghai's opera reform work is often in a very passive state.
    In May 1951, the Government Administration Council clearly stipulated in the "Instructions on Opera Reform Work" that the opera reform work in various places should use the main force to examine and approve the most popular old repertoires, and make necessary and appropriate revisions to the bad content and bad performance methods. Among some leading cadres of Shanghai's opera reform work, there is such a theory: "Shanghai relies on new dramas to make a living." The essence of this theory is the lack of a correct understanding of the rich national opera art heritage of thousands of years. Under the control of this one-sided thought, the work of reviewing old repertoires has never been done with the main force. In this way, there is a lack of serious and detailed research on the essence and dross in the heritage, and it is impossible to cope with so many needs with a batch of reviewed repertoires. The chaotic situation of private troupes in the repertoire is inevitable.
    While neglecting the work of reviewing old repertoires, in the work of organizing and leading the creation of new scripts, they have mechanically and vulgarly understood the slogan of literary and art serving politics, and promoted the tendency of formulaic and conceptual creation that replaces the reality of life with policy clauses. For example, during the "Five-Anti" movement last year, the city's Yue Opera playwrights were gathered to create dramas such as "Thousands of Troops" based on newspaper editorials, news, and communications. Because they did not show the true face of life, they were not popular with the audience. Backward masses called them "Liberation Dramas," and the saying "Liberation dramas don't make money, and no one watches them when they cooperate with tasks" became popular in Shanghai's opera scene.
    Recently, the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Culture has promoted some excellent repertoires from the National Opera Festival; in the movement to implement the Marriage Law, the Ministry of Culture has also recommended a batch of repertoires; due to the recommendation of these repertoires, the chaotic phenomenon in Shanghai's opera scene has been reduced to a considerable extent. The Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Culture has also decided that in the future, it will use its main force to lead the opera scene to carry out the work of sorting out and adapting traditional repertoires, as well as creating new repertoires. The creation office of the Municipal Bureau of Culture has reviewed and approved eight small Huai Opera and Huaiyang Opera plays; this year, it plans to sort out 20 more small plays, and adapt and create 16 Peking Opera, Shanghai Opera, Huai Opera, and Pingtan scripts. This work is absolutely necessary. These scripts should not only be supplied to state-owned troupes, but after they are performed in state-owned troupes and gain experience, they should also be supplied to private troupes. So that scripts with better quality can gradually gain more positions and educate more audiences.
    Improve the Relationship Between State-Owned Troupes and Private Troupes
    State-owned troupes should become models for implementing opera reform work. According to the instructions of the Government Administration Council, state-owned troupes (or private-public-assisted troupes) should plan and regularly perform new repertoires, improve theater management, and serve as a base for promoting local opera reform work. The seven state-owned troupes in Shanghai (including the Peking Opera Troupe and Yue Opera Troupe affiliated to the East China Academy of Opera), have relatively high quality, and most of the troupes regularly perform new plays, and the leadership has also spent considerable effort. However, the relationship between state-owned troupes and private troupes is not close, and they have not influenced private troupes well and played an exemplary role. State-owned troupes rarely provide other business assistance to private troupes other than occasionally providing performance scripts. The reasons for this situation are:
    First, some state-owned troupes have concentrated their efforts on improving themselves behind closed doors for a long time, and rarely perform publicly, such as the East China Yue Opera Experimental Troupe. Yue Opera is a genre with more audiences in Shanghai, and the East China Yue Opera Experimental Troupe has gathered more outstanding artists, but it has not performed more plays. As a result, the audience is dissatisfied, and they ask again and again: "Why doesn't our Yue Opera Troupe always perform?" The playwrights of private Yue Opera troupes said: "The East China Academy of Opera has gathered so many Yue Opera playwrights, why don't they produce more good scripts to supply everyone?"
    Second, the leaders of state-owned troupes lack the necessary political and ideological education for the artists, so that some artists have not been seriously transformed after joining the state-owned troupes, showing self-importance, pride, and contempt for other artists. Some artists in the Pingtan circle said: "The People's Pingtan Work Troupe is not letting a hundred flowers bloom, but letting one flower bloom alone." Many artists, after joining state-owned troupes, have alienated their peers and do not interact with each other, let alone ideological and artistic exchanges.
    In fact, this situation can be completely improved. The state-owned Yue Opera Troupe, Shanghai Opera Troupe, and Huai Opera Troupe in Shanghai have better conditions in this regard. They have all been in Shanghai and have countless connections with Shanghai's opera scene. If the leaders attach importance to the exemplary role of state-owned troupes and the promotion of mature experience, they can become important assistants to the leadership of opera reform work.
    Continuously Improve the Quality of Opera Work Cadres
    Opera reform work is a complex and meticulous ideological work; the serious significance of this ideological work and the actual situation of Shanghai's opera scene place demands on opera work cadres that far exceed the current level. This requires opera work cadres (including leading cadres) to study with redoubled efforts to improve themselves. The leadership should also put the work of continuously improving the quality of cadres on its work agenda and give it a considerable position.
    However, the facts are not entirely so. Some cadres are often in a busy and chaotic state of bureaucracy. A leading comrade said that after returning from participating in the festival last year, he was transferred to do other campaign-style work as soon as he got off the train, and he did it for more than a month; then there were other political movements, which also restricted the communication and study work of the festival to a considerable extent. Opera work cadres are busy running around all day. This organization calls them to attend such a meeting, and that organization sends a notice to ask them to attend that kind of meeting, so that they have no time to sit down, keep their minds clear, and calmly consider problems.
    How can ideological work be done well with bureaucratic work methods? They can only run to one or two troupes, talk to one or two people, read one or two scripts, and make one or two immature opinions. How can this meet the needs of the work and the demands of the masses?
    Most of our opera work cadres are hardworking and enthusiastic about the cause of opera reform. Now, we should end the busy and bureaucratic work style and work methods. We should make opera work cadres seriously study their business, improve their business level, and we should make our leadership of opera reform work break through general political principles and slogans, and replace them with concrete, in-depth, and meticulous ideological and artistic leadership. Because opera art is an important position of the Party on the ideological front, it requires our leaders at all levels and every opera worker to attach importance to this ideological work.
    Opera art "should help the country correctly educate the people, educate the people with patriotic, democratic, and socialist ideas, spread new social customs, improve the moral character of the people, and enrich the spiritual life of the people." (Zhou Yang: "Reform and Development of National Opera Art") This serious and glorious task requires Shanghai's opera workers to strengthen ideological leadership work, strengthen regular artistic ideological leadership, seriously and leadly solve the script problem step by step, improve the relationship between state-owned troupes and private troupes, continuously improve the quality of opera work cadres, and at the same time seek improvement in leadership ideology and leadership methods. In this way, we can better stop and correct some of the current undesirable tendencies, so that opera reform work can be further developed.

    从上海戏曲界的一些不良倾向谈戏曲改革领导工作中的几个问题
    钟洛
    较长时期以来，上海戏曲界存在着一些不良的倾向。由于上海戏曲改革领导工作中存在着弱点，这些不良倾向没有得到彻底的克服。
    这些不良倾向首先表现在对待民族戏曲遗产的极不严肃的态度上。上海戏曲改革工作的领导机构，曾经严肃地、慎重地处理过几个传统的流行剧目，由公营剧团演出，但是这种正确的态度并未在广大的戏曲界产生应有的影响。大部分私营剧团和评弹界在对待民族遗产上，一贯地表现了市侩作风。特别在全国戏曲会演以后，他们打着“民族遗产”的幌子，把封建、色情的东西，一齐搬了出来，如“何文秀”、“三笑”、“杨乃武与小白菜”乃至中央所明令停演的“探阴山”等。他们甚至公开说： “地方上无权禁演，等你们拿到中央去批准，时间拖长了，我们的钞票早已捞到手了。”全国戏曲会演的一些优秀节目，在上海也同样被市侩主义者所任意涂改。忽而抢演“秋江”，忽而抢演“蝴蝶杯”，把民族遗产随便糟蹋，当作摇钱树。他们怕小戏不卖座，就硬加进一些乱七八糟的东西，拉长到三个半钟点。
    不良倾向的第二个表现，是发展了过去那种竞尚新奇、标新立异的作风，用离奇情节，或所谓“异国情调”来吸引观众。沪剧和越剧都曾上演了由小说“十五的月亮”（海默作）改编的“沙漠情歌”，而原著在民族政策和宗教政策上都犯了严重的错误。沪剧还极不严肃地上演了日本的剧本“母亲、女人”。越剧“琼宫盗月”，标榜着“古装宫闱历史巨献”，渲染离奇的恋爱“传奇”；演出广告的庸俗化更是普遍现象。
    不良倾向的第三个表现，是表演上的形式主义、噱头主义和庸俗的“海派”作风。机关布景，光片服装，闪闪发亮的镀镍道具，忽红忽绿的灯光，都越变越厉害了。为了迎合小市民的低级趣味，为了“票房价值”，僵尸也搬上了舞台。越剧“玉堂春”用两幕戏的地位来渲染妓院的“豪华场面”。部分评弹艺人在说唱旧书时，更是加进了许多庸俗、色情的东西。这种恶劣作风是极端破坏艺术、糟蹋民族戏曲遗产的。
    这些不良倾向，是由来已久的。上海的一些主要剧种，有的十足是半封建半殖民地的社会的产物，有的虽来自农村，但在帝国主义的堕落的艺术商品影响下，早已浸透了小市民低级趣味和资产阶级的形式主义的腐朽毒素，丧失了原来的朴实的内容与形式。在解放前的长久的年月中，这些剧种抛弃了旧有的优秀剧目和传统的艺术方法。这样，也就必然使这些剧种的剧目思想内容和表演技术一天一天堕落。
    除了这个历史原因以外，这些不良倾向的产生，还有它的社会原因。跟着人民对文化生活的需要的增长，上海的剧团和剧场数量日增。小市民的低级趣味，使落后的剧目得到市场。到目前为止，据不完全的统计，在上海的剧种，有二十八个，主要的
    （观众比较多的）剧种就有十个。大、中、小型的剧团，有一百六十八个；戏曲艺人，如包括流动的和少数失业的在内，一共有八千三百多人。这么多的剧团和艺人，大部分分布在近二百个剧场和书场里，每天接触到的观众，在十万人以上（从收音机里收听广播的，还不计算在内）。
    这种复杂的畸形的情况，数量如此之多，先天如此之不健康，而影响又如此之广泛，就造成了上海戏曲改革工作的繁重性，同时也说明了这一工作的思想领导的重要性。事实日益证明：戏曲艺术是广大人民文化生活中的一个重要部分。这是必须给以足够的估计的。难道我们可以容许那么多的“九美图”“十美图”，那么多的封建的、色情的毒素，通过舞台和电台，灌输给人民大众吗？难道我们可以容许这些东西，每时每刻地侵蚀到占观众百分之五十的工人、农民和青年学生中来吗？从上海最近举行的工人文艺活动会演的一些节目看，上面所说的那些不良倾向，已经像瘟疫一样，传播到朴实的、健康的工人文艺活动中来，这现象是再也不容忽视的了。
    上海戏曲改革工作的领导机构，是作了很大的努力的。这些努力得到不少的成绩，但这并不等于已经解决了戏曲界的根本问题。戏曲改革工作的领导机构对思想领导的忽视，是上述不良倾向没有得到彻底克服的主要原因。在上海戏曲改革的思想领导工作中，下面的几个问题，是应该进一步地注意和加以解决的。
    加强经常性的艺术思想的领导
    在戏曲艺术战线上，确保工人阶级思想的不可动摇的领导地位，和各色各样的反人民的思想作斗争，应该是经常的工作，而不是一时的工作。面对着泛滥着的封建的、市侩主义的毒素，上海戏曲改革工作领导方面是作了斗争的。但是这些斗争不够经常，不够认真。没有能够抓住一些重要的事件和有利条件，及时地进行艺术思想的领导。
    譬如说：全国戏曲会演，是全国戏曲界的一个重大事件，应该成为进一步贯彻戏曲改革政策、进行艺术思想领导的重要推动力量。事实上，在参加了会演的华东和上海各公营剧团中，也确实起了好的影响。但是，这个有利条件没有被充分地利用。没有按照会演的精神和要求，结合着上海戏曲界的实际情况，组织和领导整个戏曲界进行深入的而不是浮面的学习。甚至连戏曲改革工作干部，也没有认真地、系统地学习过。东北区和中南区代表团在上海的演出，由于领导上的放松，也只热闹一阵就
    过去了。
    又如：上海戏曲改革工作也有过不少比较好的经验，如评弹“一定要把淮河修好”、“海上英雄”
    的创作，沪剧“罗汉钱”的改编和演出，淮剧的对
    一些旧的优秀剧目的整理和新戏的演出，在戏曲界和广大观众中，也起了不少好的影响。应该说，这些都是上海戏曲改革工作的重要事件。然而领导上没有及时地总结经验，加以推广，就使得那些好的影响不能更扩大，更深入。
    又如：前面所说的私营剧团从去年下半年以来在剧目和演出方面的日益严重的不良倾向，以及在全国戏曲会演以后对待民族遗产的投机作风，领导方面是清楚的，可是主要的干部一直陷在事务主义和突击性的工作中，始终腾不出手来。直到今年春节以前，才召开了几次座谈会，进行批评和自我批评，初步停止了混乱现象的发展。而在另一方面，对上海戏曲界过去曾出现过的一些坏戏，如挂着
    “镇压反革命”招牌，贩卖低级趣味的滑稽戏“活菩萨”、严重的反历史主义的越剧“信陵公子”等，非但没有予以严格的批评，反而给以奖励。这件事虽说过去很久了，但它的影响却不是一下子就过去了的。滑稽戏至今仍在变本加厉地贩卖低级下流的趣味，反历史主义倾向在历史题材的剧本中，依然到处可见。
    事实已经很明显，如果放松乃至放弃了经常性的艺术思想的领导，放松乃至放弃了每时每刻和一切反人民的文艺思想作不调和的斗争，那么，客观上必然会纵容不良倾向的发展。
    认真地解决剧本问题
    戏曲改革工作的主要环节，是剧本问题。没有剧本，就没有戏曲。每天给十万以上的观众以好的教育还是坏的教育，决定因素在于剧本。公营剧团如果有比较好的剧本，就可以经常地保持演出的质量，因而成为对人民群众进行革命教育的重要阵地。私营剧团的相沿成习的商业化作风，对剧本问题的处理是极不严肃的，几天换新戏，编剧人不得不粗制滥造，东拼西凑；一窝蜂，抢剧本，甚至到誊写社去偷看别人的本子，改头换面，就算作自己的创作。在这种情况下，许多剧本已经不是在道德品质上感染人民的艺术品，而是恶俗不堪的商品了。这种情况就说明：如果戏曲改革工作领导上能抓住这一环节，也就是抓住了主要的问题。可是，就在这问题上，上海戏曲改革工作的领导常常陷于极大的被动。
    一九五一年五月，政务院在“关于戏曲改革工作的指示”中，就明确地规定各地戏曲改革工作，应该以主要力量审定流行最广的旧有剧目，对其中的不良内容和不良表演方法，进行必要的和适当的修改。在上海戏曲改革工作的某些领导干部中，却有这样一种论调：“上海是靠新戏过日子的。”这种论调的实质，即是对千百年来丰富的民族戏曲艺术遗产，缺乏正确的认识。在这种片面的思想支配之下，对审定旧剧目的工作，就始终未用主要的力量去做。这样，对遗产中的精华和糟粕，就缺乏认真的、细致的研究，也无法以一批经过审定的剧目去应付那么多的需要。私营剧团在剧目上的混乱状况，也就势所必然了。
    在和忽视审定旧剧目工作的同时，在组织和领导创作新的剧本的工作中，却又曾机械地、庸俗地理解文艺为政治服务的口号，助长了以政策条文代替生活真实的公式化概念化创作倾向。如去年“五反”运动时，集中了全市越剧编剧人，根据报纸的社论、新闻和通讯，创作了“千军万马”等戏，由于没有表现出生活的真实面貌，不受观众欢迎。落后群众称它们为“解放戏”，上海戏曲界流行着“解放戏不卖钱，配合任务没人看”的说法。
    最近，上海市文化局曾经推广全国戏曲会演中的一些优秀剧目；在贯彻婚姻法运动中，中央文化部也推荐过一批剧目；由于这些剧目的推荐，就在相当程度上减少了上海戏曲界的混乱现象。上海市文化局也决定今后要用主要的力量领导戏曲界进行对传统剧目的整理、改编工作，以及创作新剧目的工作。市文化局的创作室，已经审定了八个淮剧和淮扬剧的小戏；今年还准备再整理二十个小戏，改编和创作十六个京剧、沪剧、淮剧和评弹的剧本。这些工作是完全必要的。这些剧本，应该不仅供应公营剧团，在公营剧团演出并取得经验以后，应该同样地供应给私营剧团。使质量比较好的剧本，逐渐取得更多的阵地，教育更多的观众。
    改进公营剧团和私营剧团的关系
    公营剧团应该成为贯彻戏曲改革工作的榜样。公营剧团（或私营公助剧团），按照政务院的指示，应该有计划地、经常地演出新剧目，改进剧场管理，作为推进当地戏曲改革工作的根据地。上海的七个公营剧团（包括华东戏曲研究院所属的京剧团和越剧团），质量比较高，大部分剧团经常演出新戏，领导方面也化了相当大的气力。但公营剧团和私营剧团的关系不密切，没有很好地影响私营剧团，起示范作用。公营剧团对私营剧团，除掉有时供给演出脚本外，很少有其他业务上的帮助。造成这种情况的原因是：
    第一，有些公营剧团，在长时期内集中力量于关门提高，很少作公开的演出，如华东越剧实验剧团就是这样。越剧是上海观众比较多的剧种，华东越剧实验剧团又集中了比较多的优秀艺人，然而却没有演出比较多的戏。于是观众们不满意了，他们一次一次地问：“我们的越剧团为什么老不演戏呢？”私营越剧团的编剧人说：“华东戏曲研究院集中了那样多的越剧编剧，为什么不多搞些好剧本，供应大家呢？”
    第二，公营剧团的领导上对艺人缺乏必要的政治思想教育，使得某些艺人在加入公营剧团以后，没有得到认真的改造，表现了自高自大，骄傲自满，看不起别的艺人。评弹界有些艺人说：“人民评弹工作团不是百花齐放，是一花独放。”许多艺人在加入公营剧团以后，就和他们的同行疏远了，互相不来往了，更谈不到思想和艺术的交流。
    其实，这种情况，是完全可以改进的。在上海的公营越剧团、沪剧团、和淮剧团，在这方面都有比较好的条件，他们都是一直在上海的，和上海的戏曲界有千丝万缕的联系，如果领导上重视了公营剧团的示范作用和成熟经验的推广，它们可以成为戏曲改革工作领导上的重要助手。
    不断地提高戏曲工作干部的质量
    戏曲改革工作，是一个复杂的、细致的思想工作；这个思想工作的严重意义和上海戏曲界的实际情况，向戏曲工作干部提出的要求，是远远超过目前的水平的。这就要求戏曲工作干部（包括领导干部），加倍努力地学习，提高自己。领导方面也应该把不断地提高干部质量的工作，放在自己的工作日程上，并且给以相当的地位。
    然而事实并不完全如此。目前的一些干部，经常地处于事务主义的忙乱状态中。一位领导同志说，去年参加会演回来，一下火车他就被调去搞其他的突击性工作，一搞就是一个多月；接下去又是其他的一些政治运动，这样在客观上也就在相当程度上限制了会演的传达和学习工作。戏曲工作干部们整天忙于东奔西走，这个机关打电话来找他们开这样的会，那个机关又发通知要他们参加那样的会，使他们没有时间坐下来，保持头脑的清醒，冷静地考虑问题。
    用事务主义的工作方法来做思想工作，怎么能做得好呢？他们只能跑一两个剧团，找一两个人谈谈，看一两个剧本，提一两个不成熟的意见。这样，怎么能满足工作的需要和群众的要求呢？
    我们的戏曲工作干部，绝大部分都是努力的，对戏曲改革的事业，是怀着很大的热忱的。现在，应该结束忙乱和事务主义的工作作风和工作方法，应该使戏曲工作干部认真钻研业务、提高业务水平，应该使我们对戏曲改革工作的领导突破一般的政治原则号召，代之以具体的、深入的、细致的思想和艺术的领导。正因为戏曲艺术是党在思想战线上的一个重要阵地，就要求我们的各级领导干部和每一个戏曲工作者，重视这一个思想工作。
    戏曲艺术，“应当帮助国家正确地教育人民，用爱国的思想，民主的和社会主义的思想教育人民，传播社会的新的风气，提高人民的道德品质，丰富人民的精神生活。”（周扬：“改革和发展民族戏曲艺术”）这个严重的也是光荣的任务，要求上海的戏曲工作者加强思想领导工作，加强经常性的艺术思想的领导，认真地、有领导地逐步解决剧本问题，改进公营剧团和私营剧团的关系，不断地提高戏曲工作干部的质量，同时在领导思想和领导方法上求得改进。这样，才能更好地制止并纠正目前的
    一些不良倾向，从而使戏曲改革工作得到更大的发展。
