　　On the Economic Construction Front of the Motherland

　　Anshan Iron and Steel to Build More Auxiliary Factories

　　In the coming years, the scale and quantity of Anshan Iron and Steel's capital construction will greatly develop. In order to further promote factory construction methods and meet the needs of construction in the coming years, in addition to the cement mixing plant that has already been established, Anshan Iron and Steel will build a new batch of auxiliary factories after June this year, including a quarry, sand quarry, mechanized supply station, metal structure manufacturing plant, mechanical installation and repair plant, prefabricated concrete factory, and the renovated first concrete mixing plant. Next year, a second concrete mixing plant, electrical repair plant, and sanitary equipment processing plant will also be built.

　　Fuxin Ping'an Vertical Shaft Sinking Project Sets New Record

　　After setting a national record of 73.42 meters of monthly progress on the main shaft in March, the Fuxin Ping'an Vertical Shaft Sinking Project team set new records in the May patriotic labor emulation campaign, with 77.1 meters of monthly progress in rock drilling on the main shaft, 85.75 meters of monthly progress in wall lining, and 80.56 meters of monthly progress in shaft completion.

　　The quality of the project has also been greatly improved, and various quality responsibility systems have been established and implemented by all teams. Currently, all employees are working hard to complete the entire shaft project two and a half months ahead of schedule, based on ensuring quality and in the spirit of not being arrogant or impatient, and making persistent efforts.

　　Dalian Steel Plant's Jin Fengzhi Team Increases Production

　　The Jin Fengzhi team of the wire drawing section of the Dalian Steel Plant's wire rod workshop has consistently exceeded the state plan in the labor emulation campaign from January to May this year. The output in April increased by 10 percent compared to March, and the output in May increased by another 5 percent compared to April.

　　In order to improve production, they have established many advanced systems. Each process and each operating position are managed by a designated person through discussion, so the team leader's work is not busy and disorganized. They have established a simple shift handover system, with a designated person responsible for accepting various tools from the previous shift and checking the numbers. As a result, no accidents occurred in January, February, March, or April. A meeting is held five minutes before each shift to discuss the work plan for the day, so that the team members have a clear understanding of the work tasks for the day, and they can fully prepare the raw materials and tools before taking over the shift. A meeting is also held after work, where team members talk to the team leader about the completion of the day's plan and the advantages and disadvantages of the work, and evaluate the performance of each team member. In addition, the team also implemented instruction charts; a team life meeting is held once a week to conduct criticism and self-criticism.

　　Niu Rusen and Others Achieve Remarkable Results in Learning New Lathe Tool Method

　　Niu Rusen, a labor model at Yunnan Iron Factory, and Li Fatian, a model engineer, have successfully learned the Soviet Kolesov new lathe tool method, increasing cutting efficiency by eight times. Based on the principles of the Kolesov new lathe tool method and combined with the actual situation of the factory, they experimented on an existing six-foot lathe with not very strong motor power, and the results were good, with the feed rate increasing by more than four times. Moreover, a very smooth machined surface can be achieved during rough turning, reducing the original process of fine turning. Therefore, the efficiency of the entire cutting work has increased by eight times. (Xinhua News Agency)

　　Technician Liu Anyu Successfully Trials Advanced Cast Iron

　　Technician Liu Anyu of the casting workshop of the state-owned Northwest First Machine Tool Plant successfully trialed the production of advanced cast iron by learning from Soviet advanced experience.

　　The Northwest First Machine Tool Plant needed to melt a kind of advanced cast iron with high mechanical properties for the trial production of Soviet-style grinders this year. Technician Liu Anyu studied the Soviet method of liquid inoculation to melt advanced cast iron and worked with workers with rich furnace operating experience to conduct a series of experiments, and finally succeeded in the trial production. The metallographic structure of this cast iron reached a type A or a mixture of type A and type B, which fully meets the standards. According to calculations, using this method to melt advanced cast iron can reduce the cost by 50,000 yuan for every 50 kilograms melted compared to the general melting method (adding ferrosilicon in the furnace). If an average of 1,200 kilograms are melted per furnace, more than 1.2 million yuan can be saved. (Xinhua News Agency)

　　Zigong Salt Field Improves Salt Quality

　　The salt produced by the Zigong Salt Field in Sichuan last year was of very poor quality. In the Dafunbao district alone, among the 890,000 dan of salt produced from July to November last year, 18,790 dan were rejected salt (waste products), and more than 40,000 dan were substandard inferior salt (containing only 86 to 90 percent sodium chloride). The poor quality of the salt seriously affected the reputation and sales of the Zigong salt industry.

　　In order to improve the quality of salt so that the sodium chloride content could reach 94 percent, the Zigong Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Zigong Salt Affairs Bureau, and the Zigong Municipal Federation of Trade Unions mobilized leading cadres and workers of various factories to conduct a comprehensive inspection of the reasons for the poor salt quality, and summarized and promoted the operating experience of workers from Jiuda Company and the state-owned Xinhua No. 1 Factory. As a result, the rejection rate of state-owned and joint state-private factories in the city fell to 21 per thousand in mid-April, basically eliminating waste products.

　　The workers in the private factories and stoves also worked hard to improve the quality of the salt. Each production shift established a salt quality inspection team to inspect, supervise, and compare each other. The Dafunbao district also organized a working group to go deep into key units, summarized a more systematic operating procedure for charcoal flower stoves for promotion, and launched a red flag competition centered on improving salt quality by district. Now, the rejection rate of private factories has also dropped from more than 15 percent at the end of last year to about 1.6 percent, and large stoves have basically eliminated the phenomenon of rejected salt.

　　Northwest Agricultural College Develops New Method to Control Pea Pests

　　The experimental farm of Northwest Agricultural College has created the "wheat bran sealing method" to kill the main pest of peas—the pea weevil. The insecticidal efficiency can reach more than 90 percent.

　　This method is: after the peas are fully mature, they are harvested and threshed in time, and a quantity of two to twenty shi (approximately 200-2000 liters) is loaded into a mat bag, covered with a foot-thick layer of wheat bran on the top and bottom, and then covered with a large mat bag, with a foot distance between the two mat bags, filled with wheat bran in the middle; or without using a large mat bag, the mat bag containing the peas is surrounded by wheat bran on all sides. In this way, the heat energy decomposed by the moisture in the beans and the carbon dioxide in the bean grains can be used to kill the pea weevil. According to farm experiments, the insecticidal rate can reach 90 to 100 percent. However, this method is not suitable for vegetable peas (white peas) in the Yangtze River basin, because these peas contain too much moisture. Currently, it is suitable for hemp peas in northern Yangtze River (that is, purple flower peas, also known as grain peas). (According to Xinhua News Agency)

　　Xinjiang Continues to Improve the Breed of Native Sheep

　　After completing the lambing of more than 100,000 blue-haired sheep and native sheep hybrids in various parts of Xinjiang Province in May this year, the work of continuing to improve the breed of native sheep will continue. The province will use blue-haired sheep breeding sheep and 150,000 native ewes for mating. Livestock workers from the Northwest Administrative Committee Animal Husbandry Bureau and the Xinjiang Provincial People's Government Animal Husbandry Department who have been dispatched to various sheep farms are conducting identification work on blue-haired sheep breeding sheep. In addition to maintaining and improving the original breeding institutions, Xinjiang Province will also add eleven artificial insemination stations and several natural mating groups in the pastoral areas of Yili, Tacheng, and Dihua prefectures. Currently, 200 students of various ethnic groups are studying hard in the sheep artificial insemination training class, and they will be assigned to various sheep improvement stations after graduation.

　　Construction of the No. 1 Ditch Reconstruction Project in Andong City Begins

　　The No. 1 ditch reconstruction project planned by the Andong Municipal People's Government this year started on June 1.

　　This ditch is 2,150 meters long and is the longest water ditch in the central area of Andong City. The working people living on both sides of it lived by this stinky ditch during the enemy and puppet rule, threatened by mosquitoes, flies and other pests, and could not even open the windows in summer. At that time, they also dreamed of turning it into a culvert, but this was just a fantasy before liberation. Today, this long-standing dream is about to become a reality. The Andong Municipal People's Government regards the construction of this ditch as the key project of Andong City's municipal construction this year, and allocates a huge sum of more than 7 billion yuan for ditch repair expenses. This ditch will be completed in October this year, and at that time, not only will people be able to walk on it, but cars will also be able to pass through.

    自贡盐场提高了盐的质量
    四川自贡盐场去年出产的盐，质量非常坏，单是大坟堡区，去年七月到十一月出产的八十九万担盐里，就有一万八千七百九十担退盐（废品），和四万余担不合标准的劣盐（只含氯化钠百分之八十六至百分之九十）。由于盐质低劣，严重影响了自贡盐业的信誉和销路。
    为提高盐的质量，使盐内所含氯化钠能达到百分之九十四，中共自贡市委会、自贡盐务局、自贡市总工会，发动各厂领导干部和职工普遍检查了盐质低劣的原因，并总结和推广了久大公司和国营新华一厂等单位工人的操作经验，使全市国营及公私合营厂退盐率在四月中旬降低到千分之二十一，基本上消灭了废品。
    私营厂灶中的职工，也都努力提高盐的质量，每个生产班都成立了盐质检查小组，互相检查、督促、评比。大坟堡区还组织了工作组深入到重点单位，总结出较系统的炭花灶操作规程来推广，并以区为单位展开了以提高盐质为中心的红旗竞赛。现在私营厂退盐率也由去年年底百分之十五以上降低到百分之一点六左右，各大型灶已基本上消灭了退盐的现象。（艾风）
    西北农学院研究出治豌豆害虫新法
    西北农学院实习农场创造用“麦糠密闭法”来杀死豌豆的主要害虫——豌豆象。杀虫效率可达到百分之九十以上。
    这种方法是：在豌豆充分成熟后，即时收割打碾，以二石到二十石的数量装入一个席包内，上下铺盖一尺厚的麦糠，外面再套上一个大席包，两席包相距一尺，中间以麦糠填实；或者不用再套大席包，而在放豌豆的席包外面四周以麦糠堆围，这样，便能利用豆内水分所分解的热能与豆粒内的二氧化碳来杀死豌豆象。经农场试验，杀虫率可达到百分之九十到百分之百。但这种方法不适用于长江流域的菜豌豆（白豌豆），因这种豌豆的水分太多，目前所适用的是长江北部的麻豌豆（即紫花豌豆，一名谷实豌豆）。（据新华社讯）
    新疆继续改良土种羊的品种
    新疆省各地在今年五月间将十多万只蓝哈羊和土种羊的杂种羊羔接产完毕后，将继续改良土种绵羊品种的工作。全省将用蓝哈羊种羊和十五万只土种母羊进行交配。西北行政委员会畜牧局和新疆省人民政府畜牧厅派往各地的畜牧工作人员，正在各种羊场进行蓝哈羊种羊的鉴定工作。新疆省除保持和改进原有的配种机构外，最近并将在伊?、塔城、迪化等专区的牧区增设十一个人工授精站和几个自然交配小组。目前已有二百名各族学员，正在绵羊人工授精讲习所紧张地学习，他们毕业后即将分配到各绵羊改进站去工作。（新华社）
    安东市改建第一号沟渠工程动工
    安东市人民政府今年计划改建的第一号沟渠工程，已于六月一日动工。
    这条沟渠全长两千一百五十公尺，是安东市中心区一条最长的水沟。居住在它两旁的劳动人民，在敌伪统治时代成年地生活在这条臭水沟旁边，受着蚊、蝇等病害虫的威胁，夏天连窗户都不能开。那时候他们也曾作过把它修成暗沟的梦，但是这在解放以前只是一个幻想而已。今天，这个多年来的梦想就要变成了现实。安东市人民政府把修建这条沟渠当作安东市今年市政建设的重点工程，拨出七十多亿元的巨款作修沟经费。今年十月这条沟渠就要竣工了，那时，上面不仅可以行人，还可以通行汽车。
