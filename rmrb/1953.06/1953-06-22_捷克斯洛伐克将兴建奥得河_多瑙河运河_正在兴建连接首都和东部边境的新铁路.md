(Dispatch from our newspaper) According to "Prague News Communication": Czechoslovakia is planning to excavate a navigable canal with a length of 307 kilometers. This canal will connect the Oder River and the Danube River in Europe. Its starting point is the city of Koźle (in Poland) at the end of the Oder River, and its ending point is Devin on the north bank of the Danube River in southern Czechoslovakia (near Bratislava). From Přerov, the midpoint of the Oder-Danube Canal, another branch of the canal will be excavated westward. This branch will pass through Brno, the capital of Moravia Province in Czechoslovakia, all the way to Kolín, east of Prague, and connect with the Elbe River. The planned Oder-Danube Canal will have a riverbed width of 41 meters and a depth of 4.5 meters. After completion, it will be navigable for ships with a deadweight of 1,000 tons.

The construction of the Oder-Danube Canal will have a significant effect on the development of Czechoslovakia's economy. First of all, Czechoslovakia can save a lot of transportation costs and promote the exchange of materials and economic cooperation between countries when trading with the Soviet Union, Poland, the German Democratic Republic, and other countries. At present, Czechoslovakia purchases iron ore from Poland and transports it from Koźle to Ostrava. The railway freight for every million tons is 112 million crowns. If it is transported by waterway, the cost will only be 25 million crowns. In the future, after the completion of the Oder-Danube Canal, the iron ore imported by Czechoslovakia from the Soviet Union (accounting for 61.3% of the total annual import of iron ore in 1951) can also be transferred to Czechoslovakia via the Danube-Black Sea Canal.

After the Oder-Danube Canal is opened, it can also solve the problem of water irrigation in the central region of Czechoslovakia. In 1947, due to drought, the harvest of agricultural products in the southern part of Moravia Province was reduced by a value of 5 billion crowns. In the future, 100,000 hectares of land can benefit from the irrigation of the Oder-Danube Canal. Two huge artificial reservoirs—the Vestonice Reservoir and the Hodonín Reservoir—are also planned. Once completed, they can supply water to nearby areas at a rate of 40 cubic meters per second. The yield of many lands currently planted with grains can be greatly increased, and they can be converted to growing vegetables and other cash crops.

According to "Prague News Communication," the excavation of the Oder-Danube Canal will begin during Czechoslovakia's second five-year plan. It is estimated that the completion of the canal will take eight years, and the total project cost will be approximately 25 billion crowns.

Connecting the Oder River and the Danube River is an ideal that the people of Czechoslovakia have cherished since the mid-17th century. However, during the past period of capitalist rule, due to the enormous scale of the project and the huge construction costs, and the inability of the canal builders to immediately profit, construction never began. Only today, when the people of Czechoslovakia have become the true masters of their own country, and under the condition that Czechoslovakia's heavy industry has rapidly developed, can the long-standing ideal of the people of Czechoslovakia be realized.
       Xinhua News Agency, Prague: Czechoslovakia is building a new railway connecting the capital Prague, the Slovak region, and the eastern border. The entire line will be opened to traffic in December this year. At that time, this new railway will become an important route for Czechoslovakia to communicate with the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, and will become an important lever for the development of domestic and foreign economies.

       The construction of the new railway line is one of the important measures of the people's democratic Czechoslovakia. In the capitalist era, Prague only had a single-track railway connected to the eastern border. The ruling class at that time, due to its anti-people policy, tried its best to hinder the normal development of economic relations with the Soviet Union. However, after Czechoslovakia established a people's democratic system, due to the continuous expansion of its economic cooperation with the countries of the peace and democracy camp, and the rapid industrialization of the Slovak region, the old single-track railway winding through mountains, river banks, and valleys has been completely unable to meet the new needs. Therefore, the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia and the government decided to pave the eastern railway into a double track, straighten the route, and rebuild the old line. After this decision was announced, it was enthusiastically responded to by thousands of Communist Party members, members of the Czechoslovak Youth League, and working people. They actively went to work on the railway construction site. Two years ago, construction work first began in the most difficult area—the watershed of a river in Slovakia. The builders excavated millions of cubic meters of soil and rocks, erected dozens of large and small bridges, and dug many tunnels through the mountains. Recently, they overcame the difficulties of the natural environment and built the longest railway tunnel in Central Europe, with a total length of four kilometers. The second track has now been laid for hundreds of kilometers.

       In order to express their love and gratitude to their liberator—the Soviet Union—the working people of Czechoslovakia have called this railway the "Friendship Railway."

    捷克斯洛伐克将兴建奥得河—多瑙河运河
    正在兴建连接首都和东部边境的新铁路
    【本报讯】据“布拉格新闻通讯”消息：捷克斯洛伐克正在计划开凿一条长达三百零七公里的通航运河。这条运河将把欧洲的奥得河与多瑙河连接起来。它的起点是奥得河尽头的科利兹城（在波兰境内），终点是捷克斯洛伐克南端多瑙河北岸的台温
    （在布拉的斯拉伐城附近）。从奥得河—多瑙河运河的中点普列洛夫城起，将再向西开凿另一条运河的支流。这条支流将经过捷克斯洛伐克莫拉维亚省的省会勃尔诺，直至布拉格以东的柯林城，而和易北河相连接。计划中的奥得河—多瑙河运河的河床宽达四十一公尺，深度为四公尺半，开凿完成以后，可通航载重一千吨的船只。
    奥得河—多瑙河运河的兴建，对于捷克斯洛伐克经济的发展，将有很大的作用。首先，捷克斯洛伐克在与苏联、波兰、德意志民主共和国等国进行贸易时，可以节省大量运输费用，而促进各国间的物资交流与经济合作。现在，捷克斯洛伐克从波兰购运铁矿砂，自科利兹运至奥斯特拉伐，每一百万吨的铁路运费是一亿一千二百万克朗，如果改由水路运输，费用只需二千五百万克朗。将来奥得河—多瑙河运河建筑完成后，捷克斯洛伐克由苏联输入的铁矿砂（在一九五一年占铁矿砂全年入口总额的百分之六十一点三），也都可以经由多瑙河—黑海运河转运到捷克斯洛伐克了。
    奥得河—多瑙河运河开通后，还可以解决捷克斯洛伐克中部地区的水利灌溉问题。一九四七年，在莫拉维亚省的南部，由于旱灾而歉收价值达五十亿克朗的农产品。而将来十万公顷的田地就可以得到奥得河—多瑙河运河的灌溉之利。两个巨大的人造蓄水湖——维斯托尼斯蓄水湖与霍多宁蓄水湖也在计划中，一旦完成，就可以向附近地区以每秒钟四十立方公尺的速度供应水量，许多现在种植谷物的土地，产量可大大提高，并可改种蔬菜和其他经济作物。
    据“布拉格新闻通讯”称，奥得河—多瑙河运河将在捷克斯洛伐克的第二个五年计划期间开始开凿。据估计，运河建筑完成需时八年，全部工程费用约为二百五十亿克朗。
    把奥得河和多瑙河连接起来，是捷克斯洛伐克人民自从十七世纪中期以来就怀抱的理想。但是在过去资本主义统治时期，由于工程规模和建筑费用十分浩大，而且运河的兴建者不能立即获利，因此一直没有开始兴建。只有在捷克斯洛伐克人民成了自己国家的真正主人的今天，在捷克斯洛伐克的重工业已有迅速发展的情况下，捷克斯洛伐克人民的这个久远的理想才有可能变为现实。
       【新华社讯】布拉格消息：捷克斯洛伐克正在兴建连接首都布拉格、斯洛伐克地区和东部边境的新铁路，全线将于今年十二月通车。到那时，这条新铁路将成为捷克斯洛伐克和苏联、中华人民共和国来往的重要路线，并成为发展国内外经济的重要杠杆。
       新铁路线的兴建是人民民主的捷克斯洛伐克的重要措施之一。在资本主义时代，布拉格只有一条单轨铁路和东部边境连接。当时的统治阶级由于奉行反人民的政策，曾极力阻挠与苏联的经济关系的正常发展。但捷克斯洛伐克在建立了人民民主制度之后，由于它与和平民主阵营国家间的经济合作的不断扩大，和斯洛伐克地区的迅速工业化，蜿蜒在山间河岸及峡谷间的旧单轨铁路，已完全不能满足新的需要了。因此，捷克斯洛伐克共产党和政府便决定把东部铁路铺成双轨，使路线伸直并改建旧线。这个决定公布以后，获得了成千上万的共产党员、捷克斯洛伐克青年联盟盟员和劳动人民的热烈响应。他们踊跃地到铁路建筑工地工作。两年前，建筑工作首先从最困难的地区——斯洛伐克一条河流的分水岭开始。筑路者曾挖掘了数百万立方公尺的泥土和石块，架起了数十座大小桥梁，并通过大山挖掘很多隧道。最近，他们战胜了自然环境的困难，建成了中欧最长的全长四公里铁路隧道。第二道钢轨现在已经铺设了数百公里。
    捷克斯洛伐克劳动人民为了表示对他们的解放者——苏联的爱戴和感激，已把这条铁路称为“友谊铁路”。
