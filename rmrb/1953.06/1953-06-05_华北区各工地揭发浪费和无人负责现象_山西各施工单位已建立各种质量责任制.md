Waste and Irresponsibility Exposed at Construction Sites in North China; Various Quality Responsibility Systems Established in Shanxi Construction Units
Xinhua News Agency, 4th dispatch – Basic construction departments in various parts of North China are actively launching movements against waste and irresponsibility, and to establish responsibility systems. The North China Construction Engineering Bureau issued instructions to its affiliated construction units as early as mid-April to carry out a mass movement to establish responsibility systems from May to July. As of now, basic construction units in Shanxi, Hebei, Suiyuan, and Tianjin have entered the stage of mass exposure and inspection.

Workers have fully exposed various instances of waste and irresponsibility. Workers at the Second Engineering Company directly under the North China Construction Engineering Bureau submitted 753 written opinions in eleven days from May 18 to 28, of which more than 80% concerned engineering quality, planning, and management. Employees of the First Engineering Company directly under the Mengsui Joint Construction Engineering Bureau discovered during this movement that the company had not yet formulated an overall plan for design, construction, material supply, and financial management for 1953, resulting in confusion and passivity in their work. After discovering these problems, the company's leadership immediately convened a joint meeting of cadres from various departments and construction sites to formulate solutions. The basic construction department of the Shanxi State-owned Jingwei Textile Machinery Manufacturing Plant immediately implemented a responsibility system with posted signs, a bi-daily inspection system for team leaders, and daily quality review meetings for leading cadres in the work area after discovering that the quality of concrete columns in one work area did not meet specifications. Many construction sites in Shijiazhuang also established a "team leader daily report" system during the movement, which played a significant role in project management and statistics.

In carrying out this movement, local organizations of the Communist Party of China at all levels and relevant leading organs have strengthened their leadership in this area. On May 21, the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China issued instructions to various places, requiring basic construction units to establish the party's unified leadership and normal working order through this movement in order to do a good job in construction. On May 7, the Taiyuan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China dispatched four working groups to assist units such as the Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Manufacturing Plant, the Taiyuan Municipal People's Government Construction Engineering Bureau, and the Third Engineering Office in mobilizing the masses, rectifying organizations, and establishing responsibility systems. The North China Construction Engineering Bureau also sent cadres to Tianjin and other places at the end of May to assist relevant units in carrying out the work of establishing responsibility systems.

Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 4th dispatch – Construction units such as the basic construction office of the Shanxi State-owned Jingwei Textile Machinery Manufacturing Plant, the civil engineering and construction team of the Yangquan Mining Bureau, and the locally state-owned Shanxi Provincial Construction Engineering Company and Taiyuan Real Estate Company have established quality responsibility systems, improving the quality of projects.

Before establishing quality responsibility systems, these construction units conducted inspections of phenomena of poor engineering quality. Because leading cadres initially had a blindly optimistic attitude, believing that workers' technical and political levels had improved after winter training, there would be no problems. Therefore, they neglected the work of establishing quality responsibility systems and relaxed quality education for workers. For example, the Shanxi Provincial Construction Engineering Company did not send experienced cadres to lead important projects, and the responsibilities of various professional teams were unclear, with each not taking responsibility for the other. The substandard roof covering of the opening and cleaning room of the Jinhua Textile Factory, which they contracted to build, was discovered on April 1, but no attention was paid to it for twenty days, resulting in more than half of it being made poorly, and it was impossible to find out who should be held responsible.

In quality inspections, they adopted the method of correcting problems while discovering them, and established various quality responsibility systems. After inspecting the shortcomings of unqualified concrete columns in one work area, the basic construction office of the State-owned Jingwei Textile Machinery Factory established a sign-posted responsibility system, a bi-daily inspection system for team leaders, and a daily quality review meeting system for work area directors, trade unions, and the Youth League, reducing the number of unqualified concrete columns from 30% to 7%. After the civil engineering and construction team of the Yangquan Mining Bureau established a departmental inspection responsibility system, bricklaying is now done with full mortar joints, and the walls are level and plumb.

    华北区各工地揭发浪费和无人负责现象
    山西各施工单位已建立各种质量责任制
    【新华社四日讯】华北各地基本建设部门积极展开反浪费、反无人负责和建立责任制运动。华北建筑工程局早在四月中旬就指示所属各建筑单位从五月到七月开展一次群众性的建立责任制运动。到目前为止，山西、河北、绥远和天津等地的基本建设单位，已进入群众性的揭发和检查阶段。
    工人们都充分地揭发了各种浪费和无人负责的现象。华北建筑工程局直属第二工程公司的工人，在五月十八到二十八日的十一天中，就提出了七百五十三件书面意见，其中属于工程质量、计划和管理等方面的意见占百分之八十以上。蒙绥联合建筑工程局直属第一工程公司的职工，在这次运动中检查出该公司至今还未制订一九五三年度的设计、施工、材料供应和财务管理等方面的全盘计划，以致在工作上造成了混乱和被动。该公司的领导方面发现这些问题以后，就立刻召集各部门和工地的干部举行联席会议，制订出解决的办法。山西省国营经纬纺织机械制造厂的基本建设部门，在检查出一工区混凝土柱子质量不合规格的情况后，立刻实行了挂牌责任制、小组长隔日检查制和工区领导干部每日检查质量的碰头会议制度。石家庄市不少工地在运动中还建立了“组长日报”的制度，对工程的管理和统计工作起了很大作用。
    在开展这一运动中，中国共产党各级地方组织和有关领导机关，都加强了对这一方面的领导工作。中共河北省委员会在五月二十一日向各地发出指示，要求基本建设单位通过这次运动，树立起党的统一领导和正常的工作秩序，以便做好施工工作。中共太原市委员会在五月七日派出了四个工作组，帮助太原重型机器制造厂、太原市人民政府建筑工程局、第三工程处等单位发动群众，整顿组织，建立责任制度。华北建筑工程局也在五月底派干部到天津等地，帮助有关单位开展建立责任制的工作。
    【新华社太原四日电】山西省国营经纬纺织机械制造厂基本建设处、阳泉矿务局土木建筑工程队和地方国营的山西省建筑工程公司、太原市地产公司等施工单位，建立质量责任制，提高了工程质量。
    这些施工单位在建立质量责任制以前，都对工程质量低劣的现象作了检查。这些单位因为领导干部开始时存在着盲目乐观情绪，以为工人经过冬训，技术水平和政治水平都提高了，不会有问题。因此就忽视了建立质量责任制的工作，放松了对工人的质量教育。如山西省建筑工程公司对重要工程没有派有经验的干部去领导，各个专业队职责不清，互不负责。他们承建的晋华纺织厂清花间的屋顶盖板不合规格现象在四月一日就发现了，但一直拖了二十天没有注意，以致有一半以上做坏了，也查不出责任应归谁负。
    他们在质量检查中，采取了一面发现问题一面纠正的办法，建立了各种质量责任制。国营经纬纺织机械制造厂基本建设处检查了一工区混凝土柱子质量不合规格的缺点后，随着建立了挂牌责任制、小组长隔日检查制和工区主任、工会、青年团当日研究质量碰头制，使不合规格的混凝土柱子由过去的百分之三十降到百分之七。阳泉矿务局土木建筑工程队建立了分部检查责任制以后，现在砌砖都作到了压浆饱满，墙面横平竖直。
