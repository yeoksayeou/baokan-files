    Poor Student Meals in the Sand Beach Area of Beijing Institute of Geology
    Jiang Chunhua from Beijing Institute of Geology writes: The student meal service in the Sand Beach area of our school has long been without leadership or concern, and is very poorly managed. Our meal expenses are 100,000 or 105,000 yuan, more than 30,000 yuan more than middle schools, but the food we eat is very bad. Dinner is the worst, with only a quarter of a bowl of vegetables, sometimes just boiled radishes. Despite eating so poorly, the meal committee still saves money. In February, there was a surplus of more than 7.8 million yuan, and in other months, the surplus was between 2 and 3 million yuan. When students raised concerns, the meal committee management replied that the surplus was to cover expenses in case the government did not issue funds in time, and to make up for the higher price of meat in the summer. As for the hygiene of the dining hall and food, no one cares about it. Students have raised concerns with the Sand Beach area administrative section, but they don't care, saying it's the responsibility of the main campus dining section; however, we have never seen any responsible comrades from the main campus dining section come to Sand Beach. The responsible comrades of the Party and Youth League organizations in the Sand Beach area also eat in the cafeteria, but they also ignore these problems. The student union also does not pay attention to these problems.

### 北京地质学院沙滩区学生伙食办得很糟

    北京地质学院沙滩区学生伙食办得很糟
    北京地质学院蒋椿华来信：我校沙滩区学生伙食工作长期无人领导和关心，办得很糟。我们的伙食费是十万或十万零五千元，比中学多三万多元，但吃的却非常坏。晚饭伙食最差，菜只有四分之一碗，有时是白水煮萝卜。我们吃得这样坏，但膳团却将钱结余下来。二月份结余了七百八十多万元，其他月份也结余二、三百万元不等。同学们提出意见，膳团管理人员回答是：结余是为了万一政府没有及时发下钱来，可以先垫上，夏天肉价贵了可以补上。至于食堂和食物的卫生情况，更是无人关心。同学们曾向沙滩区行政科提出意见，他们不管，说这是院本部膳食科的事；但是我们却没有见院本部膳食科的负责同志来过沙滩。沙滩区的党团组织负责同志也在食堂吃饭，但对这些问题也置之不理。学生会也不重视这些问题。
