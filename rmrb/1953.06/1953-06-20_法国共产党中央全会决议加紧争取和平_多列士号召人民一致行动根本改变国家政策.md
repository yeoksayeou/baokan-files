Xinhua News Agency, Paris, 19th: According to TASS, the Central Committee of the French Communist Party held a plenary session on the 16th and 17th in Issy-les-Moulineaux, a working-class suburb of Paris.

    Party Secretary Jacques Duclos delivered a report at the morning session on the 16th. Duclos pointed out that the French Communist Party is the defender of the vital interests of the nation, and it is doing its best to strive for the unity of action of the working class, because this is the foundation of the great unity of the people's strength. Duclos said: A policy of national independence, social progress, and defending democratic freedoms that conforms to the needs of France and the aspirations of the people can be defined as follows: Establishing peace in Vietnam, and concluding economic and cultural agreements that conform to the interests of the people of Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, and the French people; rejecting the policy of colonial oppression; refusing to ratify the Bonn and Paris treaties, and resolving all disputes through consultation, thereby preparing favorable conditions for the conclusion of a comprehensive peace treaty; substantially reducing military spending; implementing a fair taxation system; and respecting democratic freedoms and the constitution.

    Party General Secretary Maurice Thorez delivered a brief speech at the closing meeting. He pointed out that today, the program of united action of the masses is a decisive factor. Under the slogan of the united front, workers are taking many actions, conducting large-scale strikes, reaching agreements in elections, and participating in the peace movement in ever-widening circles. The French people are fighting for a fundamental change in French policy. All workers know that only united action can bring about this change.

    Thorez talked about the lessons learned from the experience of the Popular Front formed by the Communist Party, the Socialist Party, and others in 1936, pointing out that the French bourgeoisie and the right-wing Socialist Party leaders are afraid of united action, because united action recently marked the beginning of a broad movement that has the potential to realize some kind of transformation in France. Finally, Thorez urged Communists to overcome all the difficulties on the road forward.

    The plenary session adopted a resolution stating that the measures taken by the Soviet Union to ease international tensions have greatly affected the course of events and public opinion. The French people have never been as clear as they are now that the goal of Soviet foreign policy is only to maintain peace, only to promote international cooperation, and to restore business relations between all countries.

    The resolution emphasized that the struggle for peace must not be relaxed in the slightest, and the French Communist Party must do its utmost to prepare for the upcoming national conference on striving for peace negotiations to be held in Paris. The current tasks are: to stop the war against the people of Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia, to peacefully resolve the German question, and to reject the Bonn and Paris war treaties.

    The resolution analyzed the disastrous consequences of the anti-people and anti-working-class policies implemented by the French ruling clique over the past six years, pointing out that the people's struggle for fundamental policy changes and the working class's desire for united action have become increasingly strong. The resolution emphasized that under the current circumstances, there are favorable conditions for continuously strengthening the united action of the working class, and pointed out that the Communist Party will never confuse the employees of the Socialist Party with the right-wing Socialist Party leaders who attempt to obstruct the united action of the working class and help the bourgeois reactionary regime. All grassroots organizations of the Party must strengthen various forms of united action.

    法国共产党中央全会决议加紧争取和平
    多列士号召人民一致行动根本改变国家政策
    【新华社十九日讯】据塔斯社巴黎讯：法国共产党中央委员会十六日和十七日在巴黎近郊工人区伊西·勒·摩里努举行全体会议。
    党的书记雅克·杜克洛在十六日上午会议上作了报告。杜克洛指出：法国共产党是民族切身利益的保卫者，它竭尽全力争取工人阶级的行动一致，因为这是人民力量大团结的基础。杜克洛说：符合法国要求和人民愿望的民族独立、社会进步和保卫民主自由的政策，可以确定如下：在越南建立和平，缔结符合越南、寮国、高棉人民和法国人民利益的经济和文化协定；拒绝殖民压迫政策；拒绝批准波恩和巴黎条约，用协商方式解决一切争端，从而替缔结全面和平公约准备有利条件；大量削减军费；实行公正的税收制度；尊重民主自由和宪法。
    党的总书记莫理斯·多列士在闭幕会议上发表了简短演说。他指出：在今天，人民群众行动一致的纲领是个决定性因素。在统一战线的口号下，工人正在采取许多行动，进行大罢工，在选举方面取得协议，参加和平运动的阶层愈来愈广。法国人民为争取法国政策的根本改变而奋斗。工人都知道：只有一致行动才能促成这种改变。
    多列士谈到一九三六年共产党联合社会党等组成人民阵线的经验教训，指出法国资产阶级和右翼社会党领袖害怕行动一致，因为行动一致近来标志着一个广泛的运动的开始，有可能在法国实现某种转变。最后，多列士敦促共产党人克服前进道路上的一切困难。
    全体会议通过决议说：苏联为缓和国际紧张局势而采取的措施，大大地影响到事态的进程和社会舆论。法国人民从来没有像现在那样清楚认识到苏联外交政策的目标只是维护和平，只是促进国际合作和恢复一切国家之间的事务关系。
    决议强调：争取和平的斗争千万不能松劲，法国共产党一定要尽全力筹备快要在巴黎举行的争取和平谈判全国会议。当前的任务是：停止反对越南、寮国和高棉人民的战争，和平解决德国问题，拒绝波恩和巴黎战争条约。
    决议分析了法国统治集团六年来执行的反人民反工人阶级的政策的恶果，指出：人民争取根本改变政策的斗争和工人阶级行动一致的愿望已经越来越强烈。决议强调，在目前情况下，有着不断地加强工人阶级一致行动的有利条件，并指出，共产党绝不把社会党员工人和企图阻挠工人阶级行动一致、帮助资产阶级反动政权的右翼社会党领袖混为一谈。党的一切基层组织必须加强各种方式的行动一致。
