Lessons from the Beijing Institute of Iron and Steel Technology Construction Site's Work Schedule
By our reporter Chen Ji

The Beijing Institute of Iron and Steel Technology Construction Site, under the direct administration of the Ministry of Heavy Industry Construction Engineering Company, compiled a work schedule during the establishment of the responsibility system movement. It was initially implemented at the Second Construction Site, but due to lack of experience, unfamiliarity with the actual situation, and not understanding how to correctly compile a work schedule, the compiled work schedule was divorced from reality. After being implemented for a few days, it ran into snags and could no longer be used.

Why did the Beijing Institute of Iron and Steel Technology Construction Site fail in compiling its work schedule? What are some of the lessons?

The basis for the Beijing Institute of Iron and Steel Technology Construction Site's work schedule was unreliable. The work schedule is compiled based on the quarterly plan, construction budget, and construction organization design. Without a correct construction budget, it is impossible to make a realistic work schedule. The Beijing Institute of Iron and Steel Technology Construction Site did not have a dedicated person responsible for making the construction budget. They passed the buck to each other, delaying it for more than twenty days, before producing a budget full of errors. According to this budget, the Second Construction Site stipulated in the work schedule that the earthwork quantity for a foundation project was eighty-six cubic meters; however, during construction, one hundred and thirty-six cubic meters of earthwork were excavated to complete the foundation project. Later inspection revealed that the quantity of earthwork for the heating duct project was forgotten in the budget, resulting in an underestimation of fifty cubic meters of earthwork. Therefore, the Second Construction Site had to temporarily transfer more than ten workers from other construction sites to excavate the earthwork for this foundation project. This disrupted the original labor force requirement plan. According to the budget, the Second Construction Site planned to need 1.8 tons of steel bars, but in reality, six tons of steel bars were supplied, which was still not enough. Thus, the original material requirement plan was also inaccurate. There were also many omissions in the budget. For example, making model boards requires a lot of one-inch wire nails; however, the budget did not calculate wire nails. Work was stopped for two days to purchase this batch of wire nails temporarily. The budget for wood, iron plates, screws, etc., was insufficient, and the specifications were also incorrect, which also affected the accuracy of the work schedule. Site Director Xu Deyi told me: "On the first day of construction according to the work schedule, it was discovered that the project quantity was incorrect, there were not enough people, and materials were also lacking." The concrete workers at the Second Construction Site had only completed half of the concrete project, and the cement that was issued according to the plan was used up. This shows that without a correct budget, there is no accurate work schedule, and chaotic phenomena in construction cannot be avoided.

When compiling a work schedule, it is also necessary to understand the actual labor quota on site. The labor quota originally adopted by the Beijing Institute of Iron and Steel Technology Construction Site was the quota that was not finally confirmed in Northeast China this year. According to the quota, each earthworker should excavate eight cubic meters of earthwork per day, but the workers at the Second Construction Site of the construction site could only excavate a maximum of five cubic meters per day. The quota for bricklayers is that they should lay one thousand bricks per day, but the bricklayers at the construction site could only lay more than seven hundred bricks per day. The work schedule compiled according to this quota is not feasible. Therefore, they currently have to use last year's quota, reduced by 15%, as the basis for paying wages. When the quota is determined in the future, there will be more refunds and less supplements. This objective difficulty has indeed affected the work schedule of the construction site. However, the construction site still does not understand the actual quota on site. In the past, there were no accurate original records, so they could not understand the actual quota achieved on site from the original records. Now, the site director and technicians of the construction site cannot answer these questions: How many bricks can a bricklayer lay in a day? How much cement can a concrete worker mix in a day? Without answering these questions, there is no basis for compiling a work schedule. Even if this kind of work schedule is compiled, it cannot play its role. Our quota does not fall from the sky, but is created by the working masses. Without knowing the actual operating ability of the working masses, it is impossible to find advanced, practical, and feasible quotas to guide workers to continuously improve labor efficiency.

At present, advanced rapid construction methods—parallel flow operation methods—are widely used in construction departments. When compiling a work schedule, we must pay attention to this fact, carefully consider the construction process and construction procedures, and pay attention to the labor organization situation, so that the labor organization can adapt to the rapid construction methods. The Beijing Institute of Iron and Steel Technology Construction Site neglected this point when compiling the work schedule, which also caused some problems. When formulating the project progress, it was assumed that the laborers could dig the foundation trenches of a building in two days, but it was not considered that the concrete workers were slow and could not keep up with the progress. As a result, all the concrete workers in all the construction areas were transferred to the Second Construction Site, and it was not easy to pour the concrete for the foundation trenches in five days. In this way, the two processes cannot work in a balanced manner. When drafting the bricklaying progress, it was stipulated that the bricklayers would build the brick walls of one floor in four days, and the crane would hoist the concrete beams in two days. According to this regulation, the crane could not hoist all the concrete beams in two days anyway. Now, the progress has to be re-arranged so that the crane can catch up with the progress. When pouring the concrete foundation, there must be a setting-out procedure; however, this procedure was not included in the work schedule, which delayed the progress of the original plan. When doing the concrete foundation project, the heating duct project cannot be done at the same time; however, the work schedule stipulates that it should be done at the same time, which also hinders the progress. When digging trenches inside, the excavated soil needs to be transported out; however, the work schedule did not specify the time for transporting the soil, which will also affect the progress of the plan in the future. These facts show that without carefully studying the construction procedures and carefully considering the relationship between the various processes and the situation of the various types of work, it will destroy the work schedule and disrupt the project progress. The labor organization of the Beijing Institute of Iron and Steel Technology Construction Site is also unsound. The technical level of the workers in many bricklaying teams is uneven. Some teams have many technicians, while some teams have almost only one or two technicians. There is also an unevenness in ability between the bricklaying teams and the mortar and brick carrying teams. According to general regulations, a bricklayer should be matched with two mortar and brick carrying workers to work in a balanced manner. However, the number of workers in some mortar and brick carrying teams at the Second Construction Site is the same as the number of workers in the bricklaying teams, and some are even less. In this way, the mortar and brick carrying workers will not be able to keep up with the bricklayers in the future when laying bricks. The Beijing Institute of Iron and Steel Technology Construction Site did not pay attention to solving these problems when compiling the work schedule, and has not changed the labor organization to this day. This is an obstacle to the implementation of the work schedule.

Compiling a work schedule requires not only compiling a progress plan, but also compiling a labor force requirement plan; not only compiling a material requirement plan, but also compiling an equipment, tool, and prefabricated product requirement plan. Failure to compile a work schedule in such a comprehensive manner will also lead to failure. The Beijing Institute of Iron and Steel Technology Construction Site did not compile a work schedule for the precast concrete plant. The precast concrete plant produced blindly without a work schedule, and made many precast concrete products that are not currently needed, but the concrete beams and trapezoidal beams that are urgently needed are not made. This will affect the progress of the entire project.

The Beijing Institute of Iron and Steel Technology Construction Site did not solicit the opinions of construction workers and team leaders in the process of compiling the work schedule. Construction workers and team leaders know the situation below best. If they are consulted in advance, some of the impractical shortcomings in the work schedule can be corrected. After compiling the work schedule, they did not seriously mobilize workers, team leaders, and construction workers to discuss the plan. Some construction workers still do not know what the work schedule is today. Some workers have seen the work schedule, but only discussed it for an hour and did not raise any questions, so they could not correct the shortcomings of the work schedule in advance.

Recently, the Beijing Institute of Iron and Steel Technology Construction Site, under the direct administration of the Ministry of Heavy Industry Construction Engineering Company, accepted these lessons, revised the work schedule to make it more practical, and gave it a guiding role in construction. Before revising the work schedule, they re-examined the construction budget, understood the site situation, and overcame the problem of being divorced from reality. However, while overcoming the problem of being divorced from reality, we must also oppose the idea of perfection. Some people think: "Unless you don't make a work schedule, if you want to make a work schedule, you have to make it so that you don't have to modify it." This view is one-sided. Because it is difficult to avoid things that are partially inconsistent with reality in the original plan. Even a plan made according to the current actual situation may be broken by the workers' high labor enthusiasm in the middle, and it must be modified. The problem is that after discovering a situation that is divorced from reality, we can immediately accept the lessons and revise the original plan. This plan can be realized.

    北京钢铁工业学院工区编制作业计划的教训
    本报记者  陈迹
    重工业部直属建设工程公司北京钢铁工业学院工区在建立责任制运动中，编制了作业计划，并在第二工地初步执行了作业计划，但由于没有经验，不了解实际情况，不懂得怎样正确地编制作业计划，所以编制好的作业计划脱离实际，执行了几天，就碰了钉子，不能再用了。
    北京钢铁工业学院工区在编制作业计划中，为什么会失败呢？有些什么教训呢？
    北京钢铁工业学院工区编制作业计划的根据是不可靠的。作业计划是根据季度计划、施工预算和施工组织设计来编制的。没有正确的施工预算，是不能做出切合实际的作业计划的。北京钢铁工业学院工区在做施工预算时，没有专人负责，互相推诿，拖延了二十多天，才做出一个错误百出的预算来。根据这个预算，第二工地在作业计划里，规定一个基础工程的土方数量是八十六立方公尺；但在施工时，却挖了一百三十六立方公尺的土方，才挖好这个基础工程。后来检查，发现在预算中，忘记计算暖气沟的土方工程的数量，因而少算了五十立方公尺的土方。所以第二工地不得不临时从别的工地增调十多个工人，来挖这个基础工程的土方。这样就打乱了原来的劳动力需要计划。第二工地根据预算，计划需要钢筋一点八吨，但实际上供应了钢筋六吨，还不够用。这样原来的材料需要计划也就不准确了。在预算中，还有许多遗漏的地方。如做模型板，需用很多一寸的洋钉；但预算内，却没有计算洋钉。为了临时购买这批洋钉，停工两天。预算中的木料、铁板、螺丝等，都不够用，规格也不对，因而也影响了作业计划的准确性。工地主任许德义告诉我：“第一天，按照作业计划来施工，就发见工程数量不对头，人不够用，材料也缺少。”第二工地混凝土工人才做好一半混凝土工程，按计划领出的水泥就用完了。这说明没有正确的预算，就没有准确的作业计划，就不能避免施工中混乱的现象。
    编制作业计划，还必须了解现场实际的劳动定额。北京钢铁工业学院工区原来采用的劳动定额，是今年东北没有最后肯定的定额。按定额，每个土工每天应挖八立方公尺的土方，但该工区第二工地的工人每天最多只能挖五立方公尺。瓦工定额每天应砌砖一千块，但该工地瓦工每天只能砌七百多块。根据这个定额编制的作业计划，就执行不通。所以目前只好根据去年的定额，再减少百分之十五，来作为发放工资的根据。等到将来定额确定了，再多退少补。这个客观困难，固然影响了该工区的作业计划，但是，该工区一直到现在，对于现场的实际的定额，还是不了解的。过去没有一个准确的原始记录，因而不能从原始记录中来了解现场实际达到的定额的情况。现在该工区的工地主任、技术员，都不能答复这些问题：一个瓦工一天究竟能砌多少砖？一个混凝土工一天究竟能打多少水泥？答复不了这些问题，编制作业计划就没有根据。这种作业计划，就是编制出来了，也不能发挥它的作用。我们的定额，不是半空中掉下来的，而是工人群众创造出来的。不知道工人群众实际的操作能力，就找不出先进的切实可行的定额，用它来引导工人不断地提高劳动效率。
    目前在施工部门中，普遍采用了先进的快速施工方法——平行流水作业法，在编制作业计划时，就必须注意这个事实，周密地考虑施工过程、施工程序，就必须注意劳动组织的情况，使得劳动组织能够适应于快速施工方法。北京钢铁工业学院工区在编制作业计划时，由于忽视了这一点，因而也发生了一些问题。在制订工程进度时，以为小工能够在两天内把一栋楼房的地槽挖好，却没有考虑混凝土工工作慢，赶不上进度。结果在施工时，把所有工区的混凝土工都调到第二工地，好容易在五天内才打好地槽的混凝土。这样，两个工序之间，就不能均衡地工作。在拟定砌砖的进度时，规定瓦工在四天内砌好一层楼的砖墙，规定吊车在两天内吊装好混凝土大梁。照着这个规定，在两天内，吊车无论如何吊装不完混凝土大梁。现在又只好重新排定进度，使得吊车能够赶上进度。在打混凝土基础时，要有一个放线的工序；但在作业计划中，没有把这个工序计算在内，因而延迟了原计划的进度。在做混凝土基础工程时，不能同时做暖气沟工程；但在作业计划中却规定同时做，也妨碍了进度。在内部挖地槽，需要把挖出来的土搬运出去；但是作业计划，没有规定这个运土的时间，将来也会影响计划的进度。这些事实，说明不周密研究施工程序，不认真考虑各个工序间的关系，各个工种的情况，就会要破坏作业计划，打乱工程进度。北京钢铁工业学院工区的劳动组织也是不健全的。许多瓦工小组的工人技术水平不齐，有些小组有很多技工，有些小组几乎只有一两个技工。瓦工小组和挑浆、挑砖小组之间，也有能力不均的现象。按照一般的规定，一个瓦工，应该配上两个挑浆、挑砖的工人，才能均衡地工作。但第二工地有些挑浆、挑砖小组的工人数目和瓦工小组的工人数目一样，有些还要少一些。这样将来在砌砖时，挑浆、挑砖的工人就要赶不上瓦工。北京钢铁工业学院工区编制作业计划，没有注意解决这些问题，至今未曾改变劳动组织。这对于作业计划的贯彻，是有妨碍的。
    编制作业计划，不但要编制进度计划，而且要编制劳动力需要计划；不但要编制材料需要计划，而且要编制设备、工具、预制品需要计划。不这样全面地编制作业计划，也是要失败的。北京钢铁工业学院工区编制作业计划，没有编制预制混凝土厂的作业计划。预制混凝土厂没有作业计划，盲目生产，做出了许多目前不需要的混凝土预制品，但目前迫切需要的混凝土大梁、梯形梁，却都没有做。这样就会影响整个工程的进度。
    北京钢铁工业学院工区在编制作业计划过程中，没有征求施工员、小组长的意见。施工员、小组长最了解下面情况。如果事先和他们商量，作业计划中有些不切实际的缺点是可以得到纠正的。在编制了作业计划以后，又没有认真地发动工人、小组长和施工员来讨论这个计划。有些施工员在今天还不知道作业计划是什么东西。有些工人虽然看到了作业计划，但只讨论了一个钟头，没有提出什么问题，因而也不能预先改正作业计划的缺点。
    最近重工业部直属建设工程公司北京钢铁工业学院工区接受这些教训，重新修改作业计划，使它能符合实际，发挥指导施工的作用。在修改作业计划以前，重新审查施工预算，了解现场情况，克服脱离实际的毛病。但在克服脱离实际的毛病的同时，也必须反对十全十美的思想。有些人以为：“除非不做作业计划，要做作业计划，就要做到不再修改。”这种看法，是片面的。因为原定的计划，部分地不符合实际的事情，是难于避免的。即使一个根据目前实际情况做出来的计划，在中途也可能被工人的高涨的劳动热潮所冲破，也是要修改的。问题在于发现了脱离实际的情况以后，能够立即接受教训，修改原定的计划，这个计划是能够实现的。
