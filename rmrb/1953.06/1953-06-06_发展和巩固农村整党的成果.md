Developing and Consolidating the Achievements of Rural Party Rectification

The nationwide winter rural Party rectification work has yielded great gains. The vast majority of rural Party members have recognized the beautiful prospects of communism, found their goals, strengthened their communist worldview, and understood that to realize communism in China, they must "organize" and take the road of collectivization and cooperation. However, these gains are still very insufficient and unconsolidated. Therefore, we should do a good job of developing and consolidating the achievements of rural Party rectification.

Developing and consolidating the achievements of rural Party rectification means continuing to strive to raise the standards of Party members, continuing to give play to the Party's leading role in agricultural economic construction, and gradually transitioning the small-peasant economy to a socialist economy through the path of mutual aid and cooperation. To achieve this goal, Party leading organs are required to strengthen the leadership of rural Party grassroots organizations, improve these grassroots organizations, and enable these grassroots organizations to have sufficient capacity to strengthen the ideological and political leadership of rural Party members, so that these grassroots organizations truly become the Party's fighting fortresses in the countryside. At the same time, this will overcome the tendency of county and district Party organizations to detach themselves from grassroots organizations and reality, thereby improving the leadership style and leadership methods of county and district Party organizations and strengthening the Party's leadership over rural work.

Our Party Constitution stipulates the tasks of the Party's grassroots organizations as:

"Conducting propaganda and organization work among the masses of the people to realize the Party's propositions and the various resolutions of higher-level organizations"; "Constantly paying attention to and reflecting to higher-level organs the emotions and demands of the masses of the people, and caring about the political, economic, and cultural life of the masses of the people, and organizing the masses of the people to solve their own problems." This not only requires the Party's grassroots organizations to carry out their work in accordance with these requirements, but also requires higher-level Party organizations to regard the Party's grassroots organizations as fortresses for the Party to carry out work among the masses of the people, as bridges connecting the Party's leading organs and the masses of the people, and to constantly carry out work among the masses of the people through these grassroots organizations. Therefore, working methods that do not go through the Party's grassroots organizations will make it impossible for the Party's grassroots organizations to fulfill their tasks, reduce their role, and gradually lead the work of the Party's grassroots organizations into a state of unguided drift.

It must be seen that in many Party grassroots organizations, the state of unguided drift is very serious when the work before Party rectification or the Party rectification work was done poorly. Some Party grassroots organizations have not held Party meetings for a long time, Party members have not lived a Party life for a long time, and they do not pay Party dues. Some county and district committees do not know how many branches and Party members there are in their counties and districts, let alone understand and study the ideological situation of branches and Party members. In some individual areas, non-Party personnel from counties and districts can also convene branch meetings, and even remove branch secretaries and expel Party members. This phenomenon is intolerable. Although this kind of serious phenomenon has been greatly reduced since Party rectification, phenomena similar to this neglect of the work of Party grassroots organizations are still quite common and serious. During Party rectification, rural grassroots organizations had county and district Party committees to inspect and lead, and there were also Party rectification work teams to provide specific assistance; but after Party rectification, the work of many rural grassroots Party organizations is still in a state of unattended or infrequently managed. This will make it difficult to consolidate the results of this Party rectification, and there is even a danger of abandoning all previous efforts. Therefore, Party committees at all levels must change this leadership style, face the Party's grassroots organizations, go deep into the Party's grassroots organizations, and strengthen the leadership of the Party's grassroots organizations.

The primary method of strengthening the leadership of rural Party grassroots organizations is to strengthen the ideological education of Party members in the Party's grassroots organizations. In this Party rectification, the education of the standards of Communist Party members and the education of the direction of rural economic development were emphasized, and the exploitative thoughts and exploitative behaviors of some Party members were criticized and corrected. These educations played a great role in raising the ideological awareness of Party members a step further. However, non-proletarian ideological consciousness within the Party can never be cleared by one or two educations, especially under the continuous influence of capitalist factors that spontaneously develop around the small-peasant economy, this ideological consciousness is even more difficult to clear. Therefore, a regular ideological education work must be established in order to constantly fight against these non-proletarian ideological consciousnesses, so as to thoroughly eliminate these non-proletarian ideological consciousnesses and maintain the ideological unity of the proletariat. In addition to continuing the education of the standards of Party members, the "Resolution on Mutual Aid and Cooperation in Agricultural Production" of the Central Committee should also be emphasized for the ideological education of rural Party members. This resolution is our Party's program of rural work and the only correct line for organizing the small-peasant economy and gradually transitioning to a socialist economy. Explaining this resolution to rural Party members is a concrete communist education. When conducting this education, the experience of this Party rectification education should be fully absorbed, and the spirit of this resolution should be explained through typical figures and typical examples, using the method of enlightening education with living people and living things. The advantage of this education method is not only that rural Party members can deeply understand the spirit of the Party's policies, but also that there are practical standards to follow. The education of the standards of Party members and the education of the direction of rural development must be carried out repeatedly and constantly. County and district Party committees must grasp this work tightly.

Another method of strengthening the leadership of rural grassroots Party organizations is to effectively help grassroots organizations improve Party life by county and district Party committees, so that rural Party members can fully carry out criticism and self-criticism among themselves, and at the same time enable rural Party members to dare to frequently and promptly make criticisms and suggestions to the leadership of the branch and the leadership of the county and district Party committees. As long as rural branches have regular criticism and self-criticism, the shortcomings and problems that Party members failed to overcome and solve during Party rectification can be overcome and solved, and the various erroneous sprouts in the ideology of rural Party members can be corrected in a timely manner, so as not to develop in a serious direction. Special attention should be paid to educating the leading cadres of grassroots organizations to understand the importance of criticism and self-criticism and the methods of carrying out criticism; to fully promote democracy, and to be good at listening to the opinions of the masses and criticism from below. At the end of Party rectification, many branches conducted branch re-elections on the basis of carrying out criticism and self-criticism, and elected outstanding Party members to lead the branch work, which guaranteed the soundness of the democratic life of the branch. However, many branches have not conducted democratic elections, and the branch committees are designated by the work team. Among these branch committee members, although there are many outstanding members of the Party's grassroots organizations, there are also many who are fundamentally unable to assume the leadership of the branch. Some of them are people who have committed serious mistakes and have lost their prestige, and some are even lawless and undisciplined elements who continue to do evil and need to be expelled from the Party. Because the district committee or the county committee listened to only one side of the story, these people have been occupying the leading position of the branch year after year, hindering the progress of democratic life and criticism and self-criticism within the Party. For such branches, elections should be held again, and lawless and undisciplined elements should be expelled from the Party. While carrying out criticism and self-criticism, it is also necessary to establish other practical and feasible meeting systems, learning systems, and inspection systems to improve Party life in all aspects.

Solving the organizational problems left over from Party rectification is also an important task in strengthening the leadership of rural grassroots organizations and strengthening the leadership of rural branches themselves. In the winter Party rectification, some areas underestimated organizational handling work, or there were views of accommodation and leniency, so that there are still some bad elements in some branches who have not been cleared out of the Party, and some even continue to steal leading positions. Some backward elements in some branches have not been properly dealt with, and these people continue to be passive and do not do Party work and refuse education. Party members who have committed serious mistakes in some branches have not been punished, which has affected the implementation of Party discipline. These phenomena have aroused the attention and dissatisfaction of Party members and the masses, and have affected the purity and consolidation of the Party. Therefore, these problems should be solved in a planned and step-by-step manner. First, bad elements should be cleared out of the Party. This work can be carried out in conjunction with the struggle against bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of laws and disciplines, or in conjunction with the township election work. In addition, for a few backward elements, except for those who voluntarily withdraw from the Party, they should generally continue to be educated, and then dealt with during inspection and summary work or year-end appraisal.

The key to strengthening the leadership of rural grassroots Party organizations lies in improving the leadership style and leadership methods of district and county Party committees. During this rural Party rectification process, it was generally reflected that the leadership of Party committees above the county and district level in various places had serious bureaucratic and subjectivist work styles. In simple terms, too many tasks were assigned to rural grassroots Party organizations, the time to complete the tasks was too short, too few policies were explained, too few methods were taught, and regular education and assistance were even less. In this anti-bureaucracy struggle, many county committees examined this bureaucratic work style and made great changes in the deployment of spring plowing and production. When summarizing the deployment of production work, Zhucheng and other counties in Jiaozhou Prefecture, Shandong Province, convened a Party representative meeting or a three-level cadre meeting by the county committee. At the meeting, the county committee first examined and criticized its own bureaucracy and subjectivism from the perspective of policies and work style. After the county committee's sincere examination, the district and township cadres had the courage to criticize the county committee's leadership style; on the other hand, they automatically examined their own mistakes in their work. After the examination, a group of good people and good deeds were praised, and the correct direction and learning model were established. Finally, tasks were deployed according to the actual situation, and it was guaranteed that the county committee would uniformly grasp various work tasks and uniformly deploy them downward in the future, and resolutely prevent the phenomenon of "five excesses." This greatly encouraged the work enthusiasm of the Party's grassroots cadres, and made them confident in consolidating the achievements of Party rectification.

All county and district Party leaders should follow the "Decision on Leadership Methods" that the Party Central Committee promulgated ten years ago, and earnestly improve leadership methods. A base point area or base point township, base point village should be established in the whole county or district. All work should first be carried out in these base point areas, base point townships, base point villages, to help the cadres of grassroots organizations ideologically and politically to carry out work, create experience, and guide the general. But to do a good job in the base point area, base point township, and base point village, it is necessary to strengthen the allocation of district and township cadres, and transfer a group of cadres with rural work experience and strong leadership ability to serve as the Party work in the base point area, base point township, and entrust them with certain tasks. They should not be transferred their work within three to five years, so that they can work with peace of mind, truly take root in the masses in an area, and achieve practical results. At the same time, we should first focus on helping a township and village branch summarize a relatively complete set of work experience, promote it, so as to improve the ideological work and organizational work level of Party organizations at all levels. As long as the county and district Party committees earnestly improve their leadership style and work style, as long as the county and district Party committees can help rural grassroots Party organizations improve their leadership, develop and consolidate the achievements of this rural Party rectification work, our Party's leadership of rural economic construction will surely be greatly strengthened.

### 发展和巩固农村整党的成果

    发展和巩固农村整党的成果
    全国冬季农村整党工作得到了很大的收获。绝大部分农村党员认清了共产主义美好的远景，找到了奋斗目标，坚定了共产主义人生观，懂得了要在中国实现共产主义，必须“组织起来”走合作化集体化的道路。但是，这些收获还是很不充分、很不巩固的，因此我们应该很好地发展和巩固农村整党的成果。
    发展和巩固农村整党的成果，就是要继续为提高党员标准而奋斗，继续发挥党在农业经济建设中的领导作用，经过互助合作的道路，使小农经济逐渐过渡到社会主义经济。为要达到这个目的，就要求党的领导机关加强对农村党的基层组织的领导，健全这些基层组织，使这些基层组织具有充分的能力来加强对农村党员的思想政治领导，使这些基层组织真正成为党在农村中的战斗堡垒。同时由此克服县区党组织脱离基层组织和脱离实际的作风，从而改进县区党组织的领导作风和领导方法，加强党对农村工作的领导。
    我们的党章上规定着党的基层组织的任务，是
    “在人民群众中进行宣传和组织工作，以实现党的主张和上级组织的各种决议”；“经常注意并向上级机关反映人民群众的情绪和要求，关心人民群众之政治的、经济的、文化的生活。并组织人民群众来解决他们自己的各种问题。”这不仅仅是要求党的基层组织按照这些要求去进行自己的工作，同时要求上级党的组织，把党的基层组织当作是党在人民群众中进行工作的堡垒，是党的领导机关和人民群众联系的桥梁，经常地通过这些基层组织在人民群众中进行工作。因此不通过党的基层组织的工作方法，就会使党的基层组织无法实现自己的任务，降低其作用，使党的基层组织工作逐渐陷于无人领导的自流状态。
    必须看到有许多党的基层组织，在整党以前的工作或整党工作做得很差的情况下，无人领导的自流状态是很严重的。有的党的基层组织长期不开党的会议，党员长期不过党的生活，不缴纳党费，某些县委、区委不了解本县本区有多少支部和党员，自然谈不上了解、研究支部、党员思想情况等问题；有个别地区，县、区非党工作人员到村里也可以召开支部会议，甚至撤销支部书记职务，开除党员党籍。这种现象是不能容忍的。像这种严重现象在整党以后虽然大为减少，但是类似这种忽视党的基层组织工作的现象仍然是相当普遍而严重的。整党的时候，农村基层组织有县区党委来检查领导，还有整党工作组来具体帮助；但是整党以后，不少农村基层党组织的工作仍然处于无人管理或者无人经常管理的状态。这就会使这次整党成果难于巩固起来，甚至于有前功尽弃的危险。因此，各级党委必须改变这种领导作风，面向党的基层组织，深入党的基层组织，加强对党的基层组织的领导。
    加强对农村党的基层组织的领导，首要的方法是加强对党的基层组织中党员的思想教育工作。这次整党中，着重进行了共产党员标准的教育和农村经济发展方向的教育，并批判和纠正了若干党员的剥削思想和剥削行为。这些教育起了很大的作用，使党员的思想觉悟提高了一步。但是，党内的非无产阶级思想意识决不是一次两次教育可以清除的，特别是在周围小农经济自发地发展着的资本主义因素继续不断影响之下，这种思想意识更难于清除。因此必须建立经常的思想教育工作，以便经常和这些非无产阶级思想意识作斗争，以彻底清除这些非无产阶级思想意识，保持无产阶级的思想统一。对于农村党员的思想教育，除了应该继续进行党员标准的教育以外，目前还应着重讲解中央“关于农业生产互助合作的决议”。这一决议，是我们党的农村工作纲领，是使小农经济组织起来逐渐过渡到社会主义经济的唯一正确的路线。向农村党员讲解这
    一决议，就是具体的共产主义教育。进行这种教育时，应该充分吸收这次整党教育的经验，通过典型人物、典型事例，以活人活事进行启发教育的方法来讲解这一决议的精神。这种教育方法的好处，不仅可以使农村党员深刻地体会到党的政策的精神，并且有实际标准可以遵循。党员标准的教育和农村发展方向的教育必须反复进行，经常不断。县区党委必须抓紧这个工作。
    加强对农村基层党组织的领导的另一个方法，就是由县区党委切实帮助基层组织健全党的生活，使农村党员之间能够充分地开展批评和自我批评，同时使农村党员敢于对支部领导和县区党委领导经常及时地提出批评和建议。只要农村支部有了经常的批评和自我批评，党员在整党中未能克服和解决的缺点和问题就可以得到克服和解决，农村党员在思想上的各种错误的萌芽，也就能够得到及时的纠正，而不致向严重方面发展。特别要注意教育基层组织的领导干部懂得批评和自我批评的重要和开展批评的方法；要充分发扬民主，善于听取群众的意见和自下而上的批评。在整党的末期，很多支部都在开展批评和自我批评的基础上进行了支部的改选，把优秀党员选出来领导支部工作，这就保证了支部的民主生活的健全。但是也有不少支部并未进行民主选举，支部委员会是由工作组指定的。这些支部委员中，固然有不少是党的基层组织内的优秀分子，但也有不少是根本不能担任支部领导职务的，其中有些是犯有严重错误的已丧失了威信的人，有些甚至是继续在为非作歹的违法乱纪分子，是需要开除出党的。这些人由于区委或县委偏听偏信，年复一年地占据着支部的领导地位，阻碍了党内民主生活及批评和自我批评的进行。对于这样的支部，就应重新进行选举，并将违法乱纪分子开除出党。而在开展批评和自我批评的同时，还需要建立其他切实可行的会议制度、学习制度、检查制度，从各方面来健全党的生活。
    解决整党时遗留的组织问题，也是目前加强对农村基层组织领导和加强农村支部本身领导中的一项重要工作。冬季整党中，部分地区轻视组织处理工作，或者存在着迁就姑息的观点，以致现在仍有一些支部内的坏分子尚未清洗出党，有的甚至仍旧窃据领导地位。部分支部内的落后分子尚未得到妥善处理，而这些人继续消极不做党的工作，拒绝教育。部分支部中犯严重错误的党员尚未受到处分，影响了党的纪律的执行。这些现象已引起了党内外群众的注意和不满，影响了党的纯洁和巩固。因此，要有计划、有步骤地解决这些问题，首先要将坏分子清除出党。这一工作可以结合反官僚主义、反命令主义、反违法乱纪斗争来进行，或结合乡的选举工作来进行。此外，对于少数落后的分子，除了自愿退党者外，一般应对他们继续进行教育，到检查总结工作或年终鉴定时再进行处理。
    加强对农村基层党组织的领导问题的关键在于改善区县党委的领导作风和领导方法。在这次农村整党过程中，普遍反映各地县委、区委以上的领导存在着严重的官僚主义和主观主义作风，简单说来，就是对农村基层党组织布置的任务太多，完成任务时间太短，政策讲得太少，办法教得太少，经常的教育和帮助更少。在这次反官僚主义斗争中，很多县委都检讨了这种官僚主义作风，并在布置春耕生产等工作中都有很大改变。山东胶州专区诸城等县在总结布置生产工作时，由县委召开党的代表会议或三级干部会议。在会上，先由县委从政策、作风上检查和批判自己的官僚主义、主观主义。在县委诚恳检讨之后，区、乡干部一方面有勇气来批评县委的领导作风；另一方面自动地检讨自己工作中的错误。检查之后，紧接着表扬了一批好人好事，树立了正确的方向和学习的榜样。最后根据实际情况布置任务，并保证以后由县委统一掌握各项工作任务，统一向下布置，坚决防止“五多”现象。这就大大鼓舞了党的基层干部的工作情绪，使他们对巩固整党成果有了信心。
    各县区党的领导今后都应该遵照党中央在十年前就已经公布的“关于领导方法的决定”，切实改进领导方法。应当在全县或全区建立基点区或基点乡、基点村。一切工作首先在这些基点区、基点乡、基点村进行，从思想上、政策上来帮助基层组织的干部进行工作，创造经验，指导一般。但要作好基点区、基点乡、基点村的工作，必须加强区、乡干部的配备，调配一批有农村工作经验和领导能力较强的干部去担任基点区、基点乡的党的工作，交付他们以一定的任务，三五年内不调动他们的工作，让他们安心工作，真正在一个地区的群众中生根，收到实效。同时应首先注重帮助一个乡、村支部总结出一套比较完整的工作经验，加以推广，以提高各级党组织的思想工作和组织工作水平。只要县区党委认真改进领导作风和工作作风，只要县区党委确能帮助农村基层党组织改进领导，发展和巩固这次农村整党工作的成果，我们党对农村经济建设的领导就一定会大大加强起来。
