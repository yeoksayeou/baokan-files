Shanxi Province's farmers in many areas adopted the method of lighting fires and smoking to prevent frost damage to crops during the cold wave in mid-May, with good results.

On May 12th, the Shanxi Provincial Department of Agriculture received a notice from the Central Ministry of Agriculture about an impending cold wave on the 13th and 14th. It immediately notified all levels of government by telephone to organize forces to go deep into the countryside to lead the masses in preventing frost. On the same day, Party and government leading organs in various counties organized a large number of cadres to go to the countryside to carry out frost prevention work. Forty-five counties including Fenyang, Wuxiang, Changzhi, Hongdong, Quwo, and Guo County organized 3,330 cadres, led by county Party secretaries and county heads, to go to the countryside to provide specific guidance to the masses in implementing fire prevention. The leading organs of Jiaocheng County extracted more than 50 cadres to study the technical experience of lighting fires for frost prevention and rushed to various districts overnight to lead the farmers in fighting the frost disaster. Some comrades traversed two mountains about 15 li high in the pitch-black night, running and rushing to several districts more than 100 li away from the county seat. The county and district cadres of the entire county did not sleep for two whole nights, going deep into the fields to lead the masses in frost prevention. Due to the close organization, timely ignition, and mastery of considerable technology in various counties of the Changzhi Special District, the effect was good. The counties in the Yanbei Special District did not understand the technology of lighting fires for smoking, and the effect was not significant. The next day, the Provincial Department of Agriculture broadcast the experience of the Changzhi Special District to various counties by radio and telephone. That night, all counties improved the organization of manpower and the technology of lighting fires for smoking. Zhao County organized 30,000 people to participate in frost prevention work and achieved joint prevention and unified action in every village. Shuoxian and Fenyang counties lit 5,373 piles of fire in 111 villages; cadres and masses in Luowangzhuang, Jiexiu County, created a method of increasing the size of the fire piles and covering the wet firewood with soil, which produced more smoke and lasted longer. One pile of smoke and fire could smoke for three or four hours. In addition, the masses in some places also used tiles, thick paper, and soil to cover cotton seedlings and melons and vegetables to protect them from frost damage.

Through the efforts of cadres at all levels and the broad masses, frost damage in most areas of Shanxi Province was greatly reduced. In Jiexiu County, except for Qiangnan Village, where nearly 10 mu of sweet potatoes and 3 mu of cotton were damaged by frost due to cadre negligence, more than 500,000 mu of crops were not damaged by frost. In Jiaocheng County, of more than 300,000 mu of crops, except for more than 70 mu of cotton seedlings and about half of the melons and vegetables that were damaged by frost, the rest were not damaged. In Quwo County, only 10 percent of the crops in areas where frost prevention measures were taken were damaged by frost, while in areas where prevention was not taken, more than 20 percent were damaged; in Xixian County, only 50 percent of the areas that were prevented were damaged by frost, while about 70 percent of those that were not prevented were damaged.

However, because the temperature change was too great and the weather was too cold this time (some counties in the Linfen and Yuncheng Special Districts in southern Shanxi dropped to minus three degrees Celsius, and Ying County in the Yanbei Special District received two to four inches of snow, with the ground freezing more than one inch deep), coupled with some shortcomings in the frost prevention work, crops such as cotton, beans, spring wheat, and vegetables in many areas still suffered varying degrees of frost damage, with cotton fields being the most severely affected. In Lucheng and other four villages in the Fourth District of Fenyang, 80 percent of the 3,000 mu of cotton fields were damaged by frost; in Yicheng, cotton seedlings were 60 percent damaged by frost after one hour of snowfall; in individual villages in Wanquan County, all cotton seedlings were completely destroyed by frost. In light of this situation, the leading organs of Shanxi Province decided to mobilize the masses to transplant seedlings and replant.

The results of this frost prevention prove that the method of lighting fires for smoking is very effective, but there must be a lot of smoke so that the smoke covers the fields and seedlings; attention must be paid to mastering the time when lighting the fire, neither too early nor too late. According to the general situation, the coldest time is from 3:00 am to 6:00 am in the second half of the night, and crops are most susceptible to frost damage. During this period, it is necessary to observe the thermometer from time to time and grasp the temperature changes. If the temperature drops quickly, prepare when it reaches two or three degrees Celsius, and light the fire when the thermometer reaches one degree Celsius; if the temperature drops slowly, you can light the fire at zero degrees Celsius to avoid wasting firewood by lighting the fire too early or not having an effect if it is too late.

    山西农民与冻害作斗争取得胜利
    山西省许多地区的农民在五月中旬寒流侵袭时，采取点火熏烟办法，预防农作物受冻，效果很好。
    五月十二日，山西省农业厅接到中央农业部关于十三、十四两日将有寒流侵袭的通知，立即用电话通知各级人民政府，组织力量深入农村领导群众防冻。各县党政领导机关当天就组织了大批干部下乡，进行防冻工作。汾阳、武乡、长治、洪洞、曲沃、崞县等四十五个县，组织了以县委书记、县长为首的三千三百三十个干部下乡，具体指导群众实行点火防冻。交城县领导机关抽出五十多名干部，研究了点火防冻的技术经验，星夜赶到各区，领导农民和冻灾作斗争。有的同志在漆黑无光的深夜里，翻过高约十五里的两座山岭，连奔带跑地赶到离县城一百多里的几个区。全县县区干部整整两夜未睡，深入田间领导群众防冻。长治专区各县由于组织严密、点火及时，并掌握了相当的技术，效果良好。雁北专区各县因不懂点火熏烟的技术，收效不大。第二天，省农业厅就把长治专区的经验，用无线电广播和电话通报各县，当夜各县都改进了组织人力和点火熏烟的技术。赵城县组织了三万群众参加防冻工作，并做到了村村联防，一齐行动。朔县、汾阳县一百一十一个村点火五千三百七十三堆；介休县罗王庄干部和群众创造了把火堆加大，在湿柴上面盖土的办法，冒烟较多较久，一堆烟火可以熏三、四小时。此外，有些地方的群众还用瓦片、厚纸和土遮盖棉苗和瓜菜，使它们免受冻害。
    经过各级干部和广大群众的努力，山西省大部地区的冻害大大减轻。介休县除强南村因干部麻痹冻坏将近十亩红薯和三亩棉花外，其余五十多万亩农作物都没有遭受冻害。交城县三十余万亩农作物，除七十余亩棉苗与约半数的瓜菜受冻外，其余的都没有伤损。曲沃县采取了防冻措施的地区，只有百分之十的庄稼受冻，未预防的地区，受冻的在百分之二十以上；隰县预防的地区仅受冻百分之五十，没有预防的受冻百分之七十左右。
    但因这次气温变化太大，天气太冷（晋南临汾、运城两专区有的县降至零下三度，雁北专区应县降雪二——四寸厚，地冻一寸多深），加以防冻工作上又有些缺点，以致不少地区的棉、豆、春麦、蔬菜等作物，仍然遭受了不同程度的冻害，其中以棉田受灾较重。汾阳四区卢城等四村三千亩棉田受冻的有百分之八十；翼城下雪一小时，棉苗被冻坏的有百分之六十；万泉县个别村的棉苗已全部冻坏。根据这种情况，山西省领导机关决定动员群众移苗补种。
    这次防冻的结果，证明点火熏烟的办法很有效果，但必须烟多，使烟笼罩田苗；在点火时必须注意掌握时间，不能过早或过迟。按一般情况，下半夜三时至六时最冷，农作物最易受冻，在这一段时间必须时时观察温度计，掌握温度的变化，如温度下降得快，到二、三度时就进行准备，到摄氏表一度时就可以点火；如温度下降得慢，可以在零度时点火，以免点火过早浪费柴草，过迟不起作用。（于志平）
