Britain, France, and Other Countries Demand the United States Open its Markets

Recently, business figures and their political representatives in Britain and other Western European capitalist countries have been discussing their foreign trade problems with increasing anxiety. Because the United States uses "aid" to bind and damage Western European economies, fiercely squeeze out the traditional forces of Western European countries in the entire capitalist world market, prohibits Western European countries from trading with the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries, and at the same time builds high tariff barriers to restrict Western European goods from entering the American market, the foreign trade of Western European countries is facing a dead end. The resentment of the bourgeoisie in Britain and other Western European countries towards the United States' foreign economic policy is growing stronger and stronger.

In March of this year, British Foreign Secretary Eden formally requested the United States to "trade, not aid" during his visit to the United States. In April, the "European Economic Cooperation Bureau," composed of representatives from eighteen countries, also sent a delegation to the United States with the same request. However, the United States has remained indifferent to this, which cannot but disappoint Britain and other Western European countries greatly. British Chancellor of the Exchequer Butler delivered two consecutive speeches in early May, complaining about the United States' trade restrictions on Britain. The "European Consultative Assembly," composed of parliamentarians from fourteen countries, passed a resolution on May 13 demanding that the United States lower tariffs. At the recent 14th Congress of the "International Chamber of Commerce," representatives from many capitalist countries also expressed their opposition to the high tariffs of the United States. These situations indicate that the demand for the United States to open its markets has become a common call in Western European countries. The long-standing dissatisfaction of Western European countries with various trade restrictions imposed by the United States is now concentrated on the issue of American tariff barriers.

It is completely understandable that Britain and other Western European countries are putting forward the slogan "trade, not aid" to the United States. For several years, the ruling groups of Britain and other Western European countries have sacrificed national sovereignty and accepted enslaving "American aid," thereby implementing the United States' arms expansion and war preparation policies. They had fantasized about using this stopgap measure to overcome their own financial and economic difficulties. But the result is that the United States has taken the opportunity to carry out large-scale expansion, manipulate the economies of Western European countries, destroy the multi-faceted economic ties historically formed between capitalist countries, replace them with unilateral and unequal trade relations between these countries and the United States, and restrict these countries' favorable trade with the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries. This absurd trade policy of the United States has brought great damage to Western European countries and further reduced the already shrunken capitalist world market, leading it into increasing chaos and disintegration. Under these circumstances, the financial and economic crises of Western European countries have deepened, and the trade deficits and dollar shortages that Western European countries are most troubled by have worsened. After accepting "aid," the year with the smallest trade deficit in Western Europe (1950) was still over 2.1 billion US dollars. In 1952, it increased to 3.448 billion US dollars. In 1952, Britain's trade deficit was over 780 million pounds. Dollar shortage has become a common phenomenon in Western Europe. As Butler said: "Wherever you go in Europe, you will see the same dollar gap between the dollar world and the non-dollar world." The United Nations' 1951-1952 World Economic Report also acknowledges that "most countries in the capitalist world are unable to balance their accounts with the United States." Although Britain has tried desperately to reduce imports to save dollars, its gold and dollar reserves fell to the lowest figure since the war in 1952. Faced with such facts, the ruling classes of Britain and other Western European countries have to consider that if they continue to rely solely on "American aid," their interests will be even more threatened and damaged. They hope to earn more dollars by expanding exports to the United States to balance trade in order to maintain their economic position and alleviate their financial and economic crises.

However, Britain and other Western European countries have encountered the serious obstacle of high American tariffs in their efforts to expand trade with the United States. The United States levies tariffs of 40 to 70 percent on imported industrial and agricultural products. The customs declaration procedures in the United States are extremely complicated, with as many as 8,000 tariff categories. According to the American capitalist Ford, "The American tariff regulations are as thick as the Chicago telephone directory...it is a barrier of complicated procedures deliberately designed to exclude imported goods, which is almost impossible to pass through." The United States also implements the so-called "Buy American Act," which stipulates that the US government cannot casually purchase foreign goods unless the price of foreign goods is 25 percent lower than the price on the American domestic market. These measures greatly hinder the entry of foreign goods into the American market. In addition, the United States also imposes artificial restrictions on Britain and other Western European countries on shipping issues. According to the provisions of the so-called "Mutual Security Act," 50 percent of all "American aid" materials must be transported by American ships. In particular, due to the adverse effects of the United States' "embargo" policy, the British shipping industry, which once carried half of the world's sea transport, has declined significantly. On the issue of raw materials, the United States has exhausted all means to monopolize the raw material market of the capitalist world and desperately lowered the prices of industrial raw materials such as rubber, most of which are produced in British imperial territories. On the issue of gold, the United States disregards the interests of the British Empire, which owns 70 percent of the gold production in the capitalist world, and pegs the price of gold to the currently undervalued 1934 level. All of these obviously greatly limit Britain's foreign exchange earnings and make Anglo-American trade relations increasingly worse.

Until now, Britain has not seen any signs of the United States relaxing trade restrictions. Many American capitalists, in order to protect their domestic market sales from the influence of low-priced foreign goods, thereby maintaining their high monopoly prices, insist on implementing an extremely protectionist tariff policy. Taft and many "powerful" Republican congressmen fiercely oppose lowering tariffs and opening markets. They openly expressed their dissatisfaction with Eden's "idea of coming to the United States to sell 'trade, not aid'." Taft even sarcastically said that he only agreed with the second half of this slogan. Republican Congressman Simpson even introduced a bill to Congress demanding the strengthening of tariff barriers and stipulating that the President has no power to reduce tariffs. Senators from fourteen western states have introduced bills to prevent the import of agricultural products. Another thirty-seven bills aimed at restricting imports have also been submitted to Congress. The milk industry, wool production and the woolen industry, the silk industry, the chemical industry, cotton production and the cotton textile industry, the metal mining industry, and a part of the petroleum industry have all requested the strengthening of import restrictions.

It must be pointed out that now is the time when competition in the capitalist world market is becoming more acute and overproduction is becoming more serious. The United States' absurd trade policy has deepened the economic difficulties of capitalist countries and made their sales conditions generally worse, forcing almost all capitalist countries to compete to restrict imports and strengthen trade barriers, thereby creating an extremely tense state of trade relations between capitalist countries. In this tense state, whoever opens the market first will suffer damage. The Washington "Evening Star" wrote that protective tariffs are not a habit unique to the United States, and if the United States lowers tariffs itself, "there is no guarantee that other countries will follow suit." Sibley, chairman of the Cotton Merchants Association, said more bluntly: "Contrary to the propaganda spread, the real solution to the balance of payments lies less in the United States further lowering tariffs than in the actions of other countries." Therefore, it is clear that it is impossible for American monopoly capitalists to abandon protectionist policies. Precisely because of this, Eisenhower did not practice the promise of so-called "free trade" he made in his first State of the Union address, but only proposed extending the "Reciprocal Trade Act" for one year in order to maintain the status quo.

Of course, there are also other American capitalists who advocate lowering tariffs to some extent. Their disputes with those who oppose opening the market reflect the complex contradictions between different capitalist groups in the United States. They are mostly business owners who rely mainly on foreign markets, have strong competitive ability, and require a large number of imported raw materials. Ford recently publicly said: "We businessmen have always welcomed competition." This is because they can completely overwhelm the competition of foreign goods in the domestic market; on the other hand, they have a large amount of investment abroad, so they are eager to expand abroad. These capitalists and their political representatives in the government see that if the opportunities for Western European countries to earn dollars are greatly restricted, it will only force these countries to further reduce their purchases of goods from the United States. They are worried that retaliatory import restrictions between capitalist countries will ultimately be unfavorable to them. At the same time, they are also worried that "if Western Europe cannot export to the United States, they will eventually find a way out to the East" ("Washington Post").

It should be mentioned that even if the United States relaxes restrictions to some extent, just as it has reduced some tariffs in the past, it cannot solve the foreign trade problems of Western European countries. This is because the trade crisis currently encountered by Britain and other Western European countries cannot be resolved by making some concessions in the United States' import and tariff policies. Because the United States has militarized its national economy, the vast majority of people are becoming increasingly impoverished, and the American domestic market is also shrinking day by day. At the same time, American prices fluctuate frequently, and the market is very unstable.

If Britain pins its trade outlet on the American market, it will further deepen Britain's dependence on the United States and will further subject the British economy to the adverse effects of the unstable and gradually crisis-ridden American economy. As British Conservative Member of Parliament Harold Watkinson said, the more Britain relies on the American market, the more "fragile Britain's trading position becomes." More importantly, the United States' relaxation of tariff barriers will inevitably be conditional on Britain and other Western European countries also lowering tariffs, removing import restrictions, and abolishing imperial preferences, which would bring worse economic consequences to Britain and other Western European countries, because the United States and Western European countries differ greatly in terms of economic strength and competitive conditions. In fact, those American monopoly capitalists who tout "free trade," hypocritically advocate opening the American market, and "allowing American friends to also show their skills in the American market" are harboring plans to launch an even greater attack on Western European countries and their traditional markets with eager anticipation.

It can be seen from this that the demand for "trade, not aid" put forward by Britain and other Western European countries to the United States, although completely reasonable, is not a real solution because the United States cannot open its own market according to the requirements of Western Europe.

Butler pleaded with the United States in his speech on March 11 to give Britain "a foothold and a path so that Britain can climb onto the plain of equal cooperation," which is of course unrealistic. American monopoly capitalists, in order to seize their own insatiable profits and to strengthen their control over Britain and other Western European countries, very much hope that Britain and other Western European countries will forever struggle in the deep valley of the dollar shortage. Britain and other Western European countries can only find their own "foothold and path" by striving for their own independent status, getting rid of the restrictions of the United States' restrictive trade and discriminatory policies, and getting rid of the restrictions of the United States' arms expansion and war preparation policies. Under the strong influence of the people, certain business figures and their political representatives in Britain and other Western European countries are increasingly realizing a real way out: that is, implementing an independent and autonomous trade policy, opposing the United States' "embargo" measures, and promoting equal and mutually beneficial trade between the West and the East.

    英法各国要求美国开放市场
    崔奇
    最近以来，英国和西欧资本主义国家的企业界人士及其政治代表，怀着日益增长的不安心情，谈论着他们的对外贸易问题。由于美国利用“援助”束缚和损害了西欧的经济，在整个的资本主义世界市场上猛烈排挤西欧国家的传统势力，禁止西欧国家和苏联及人民民主国家进行贸易，同时又高筑关税壁垒限制西欧各国商品进入美国市场，西欧国家的对外贸易已面临走投无路的境地。英国和西欧国家的资产阶级对美国对外经济政策的愤懑不平的情绪，是越来越强烈了。
    今年三月，英国外交大臣艾登访美时，曾向美国正式提出“要贸易，不要援助”的要求。四月间，由十八个国家参加的“欧洲经济合作局”也派遣代表团赴美，提出了同样的要求。但是美国对此一直采取冷漠态度。这就不能不使英国和西欧国家感到很大的失望。英国财政大臣巴特勒于五月初接连两次发表演说，埋怨美国对英国的贸易限制。由十四个国家议员参加的“欧洲咨询议会”，于五月十三日通过了要求美国降低关税的决议。在最近召开的
    “国际商会”第十四届代表大会上，许多资本主义国家的代表也对美国的高额关税表示反对。这些情况说明，要求美国开放市场，已成为西欧国家的普遍呼声。西欧国家长久以来对美国限制贸易的种种措施的不满情绪，现在正集中在美国的关税壁垒问题上而表现出来了。
    英国和西欧国家向美国提出“要贸易，不要援助”的口号，这是完全可以理解的。数年来，英国和西欧国家的统治集团不惜牺牲国家主权，接受了奴役性的“美援”，从而又执行了美国的扩军备战政策。他们曾幻想用这种饮鸩止渴的办法来克服自己的财政经济困难。但结果是：美国借此大举进行扩张，操纵了西欧的经济，破坏了资本主义国家间在历史上形成的多角的经济联系，而代以这些国家和美国之间的单方面的和不平等的贸易关系，并限制了这些国家与苏联和人民民主国家的有利贸易。美国这种荒谬的贸易政策给西欧国家带来极大的损害，并使战后进一步缩小了的资本主义世界市场，日益陷于混乱和瓦解之中。在这种情况下，西欧各国的财政经济危机日益加深，西欧国家最感苦恼的贸易逆差和美元缺乏问题是更加恶化了。西欧国家接受“援助”后，贸易逆差最少的一年（一九五○年）也在二十一亿美元以上。一九五二年则增为三十四亿四千八百万美元。一九五二年英国的贸易逆差为七亿八千余万英镑。美元荒已成为西欧的普遍现象。正同巴特勒所说：“你走到欧洲任何地方，你都会看到同样的美元世界与非美元世界之间的美元差额问题”。联合国一九五一——一九五二年世界经济报告也承认，资本主义世界“大多数国家都没有能力来平衡他们与美国的账目”。英国虽然用拼命削减入口的办法来节省美元，但是一九五二年它的黄金美元储备却降到战后的最少数字。英国和西欧国家的统治阶级在这样的事实面前，不得不考虑到，如果继续单纯地靠“美援”过活，将使自己的利益受到更大的威胁和损害。他们企望用扩大对美国输出的办法，来赚取较多的美元，平衡贸易，以便保持自己的经济地位，缓和自己的财政经济危机。
    但是英国和西欧国家要扩展对美国的贸易，却碰到了美国高额关税的严重障碍。美国对输入的工业品和农产品要征收百分之四十到百分之七十的关税。美国的报关手续异常复杂，关税类别有八千种之多。据美国资本家福特说：“美国关税条例有芝加哥电话簿那么厚，……是一道蓄意排挤进口货的几乎不可通过的繁杂手续的壁垒”。美国还实行着所谓“买美国货法案”，这个法案规定，美国政府不能随便购买外国货，除非外国货的价格比美国国内市场价格低百分之二十五。这些措施极大地阻碍了外国货进入美国市场。此外，在航运问题上，美国也对英国和西欧国家加以人为的限制。根据所谓
    “共同安全法案”的规定，全部“美援”物资的百分之五十必须由美船装运。特别是由于美国“禁运”政策的恶劣影响，曾经载运世界海运半数的英国航业已显著衰退。在原料问题上，美国竭尽一切手段垄断资本主义世界原料市场，拼命压低大部分都出产在英帝国土地上的橡胶等工业原料的价格。在黄金问题上，美国不顾拥有资本主义世界黄金产量百分之七十的英帝国的利益，而把金价死钉在如今已嫌过低的一九三四年的水平上。所有这些显然都大大地限制了英国的外汇收入，并使英美贸易关系越来越恶化。
    直到现在，英国还看不到美国有放松贸易限制的任何迹象。美国的许多资本家，为了使他们在国内市场上的商品销售不受低价外货的影响，从而维持其高额垄断价格，坚持地主张实行极端保护性的关税政策。塔夫脱和许多“有势力的”共和党议员就激烈地反对减低关税，开放市场。他们对艾登“到美国出售‘要贸易，不要援助’的思想”，公开表示不满。塔夫脱甚至尖刻地说，他只同意这个口号的后半部。共和党众议员辛普生更向国会提出一个法案，要求加强关税壁垒，并规定总统无权降低关税。十四个西部诸州的参议员提出了阻止农产品入口的法案。还有三十七个旨在限制入口的法案也已经提交给国会。牛奶业、羊毛生产和毛织业、丝织业、化学工业、棉花生产和棉织业、金属矿业和一部分石油业，都纷纷要求加强限制入口。
    必须指出，目前正是资本主义世界市场的竞争更加尖锐，生产过剩更加严重的时候。美国荒谬的贸易政策更加深了资本主义国家的经济困难，使它们的销售条件普遍恶化，迫得几乎所有的资本主义国家都竞相限制入口，加强贸易壁垒，从而造成了资本主义国家间贸易关系的异常紧张状态。在这种紧张状态中，谁先开放市场，谁就要受到损害。华盛顿“明星晚报”写道，保护关税并不是美国一国的习惯，如果美国自己降低关税，“其他国家会不会效仿是没有保证的”。棉业商会主席西布勒更直率地说：“与散布的宣传相反，真正解决支付平衡的办法与其说在于美国进一步降低关税，不如说在于其他国家的行动”。因此，显然地，要美国垄断资本家放弃保护政策，是不可能的。正因如此，艾森豪威尔并没有实践他在第一个国情咨文中所提出的所谓“自由贸易”的诺言，而只是提议延长“互惠贸易法”一年，以便维持现状。
    当然，也有另外一部分美国资本家，是主张在某种程度上降低关税的。他们和反对开放市场者发生了争论，反映了美国国内不同的资本家集团之间的复杂矛盾。他们多半是主要依靠国外市场的、竞争能力较强的和需要大量入口原料的企业主。福特最近公开地说：“我们商人向来欢迎竞争”。这是因为他们在国内市场上完全可以压倒外货的竞争；另一方面，他们在国外拥有大量的投资，因此急欲对外扩张。这些资本家及其在政府中的政治代表看到，如果西欧国家赚取美元的机会大受限制，只会迫使这些国家更加减少向美国购买货物。他们担心资本主义国家间报复性的入口限制，最后也将对自己不利。同时他们还担心，“如果西欧不能向美国输出，最后它们就要向东方找出路”（“华盛顿邮报”）。
    应当提到，即使美国在某种程度上放松限制，像它在过去也曾减低过一些关税那样，也是不能解决西欧国家的对外贸易问题的。这是因为目前英国和西欧国家所遭遇的贸易危机，决不是由美国在输入和关税政策上作一些让步就能解除的。由于美国把国民经济军事化，广大人民日趋贫困，美国国内市场也在日益萎缩，同时，美国的物价经常波动，市场非常不稳。
    如果英国把自己的贸易出路寄托在美国市场上，那就会进一步加深英国对美国的依赖性，并将进一步使英国经济受到动荡不稳的和渐渐陷于危机之中的美国经济的恶劣影响。正如英国保守党议员哈罗德·董金逊所说，英国越是依靠美国市场，英国的
    “贸易地位就变得越脆弱”。更重要的是，美国放松关税壁垒必然要以英国和西欧国家也降低关税、撤除入口限制、取消帝国特惠制为条件，那就会给英国和西欧国家带来更坏的经济结果，因为美国和西欧国家就经济实力和竞争条件说来是相差悬殊的。事实上，那些高唱“自由贸易”、假仁假义地主张开放美国市场，“允许美国朋友们也到美国市场上来一显身手”的美国垄断资本家们，心中正怀着跃跃欲试地向西欧国家及其传统市场展开更大进攻的计划。
    由此可见，英国和西欧国家向美国提出的“要贸易，不要援助”的要求，虽然是完全合情合理的；但是由于美国不可能按照西欧的要求开放自己的市场，因此它并不是一条真正的出路。
    巴特勒在三月十一日的演说中，曾恳求美国给英国“指出立脚点和道路，以使英国爬上平等的合作的平原”，这当然是不切合实际的。美国垄断资本家为了攫取自己永不满足的利润，为了加强控制英国和西欧国家，倒是很希望英国和西欧国家永远辗转在美元荒的深谷中。英国和西欧国家只有争取自己的独立地位，摆脱美国的限制贸易和歧视政策的束缚，摆脱美国扩军备战政策的束缚，才能找到自己的“立脚点和道路”。在人民群众的强烈影响下，英国和西欧国家的某些企业界人士及其政治代表人物，正越来越多地认识到一条真正的出路，这就是：实行独立自主的贸易政策，反对美国的“禁运”措施，促进西方和东方之间的平等互利的贸易。
