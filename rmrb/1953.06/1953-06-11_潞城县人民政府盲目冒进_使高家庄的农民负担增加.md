    The Lucheng County People's Government's Blind Impetuosity
    Increased the Burden on Farmers in Gaojiazhuang
    Reader Han Fuwang writes: Last year, the Lucheng County People's Government in Shanxi Province blindly decided to make Gaojiazhuang Village in the Fifth District a model village for "waterwheelization" in the county, forcing farmers in the village to dig wells and purchase waterwheels in large quantities. The farmers' burden was very heavy, but they did not receive any benefits from "waterwheelization."
    Gaojiazhuang Village has a total of 195 households. In 1952, the total value of agricultural income was 377,758,000 yuan, and the agricultural tax was equivalent to 39,200,000 yuan, but the amount used for digging wells and purchasing waterwheels in the whole year was as high as 157,796,000 yuan, accounting for 41.8 percent of the total agricultural income, enough for the village to pay patriotic grain for four years. In June and July of last year, the county successively "pushed" 46 waterwheels, each priced at 2.3 million yuan. At that time, the masses were unwilling to buy them. Feng Laicheng, a staff member of the County Agriculture and Forestry Section, and Gao Xi'en, a civil affairs assistant in the Fifth District, told the masses: "A waterwheel costs 2.3 million yuan and can irrigate 20 mu of land, so you must buy it." The masses were still unwilling to buy it. So they held mass meetings for nine nights in a row and a full three days to distribute them. Wang Pingshun and 20 other farmers were assigned one each, on the grounds that they were relatively wealthy. Farmer Wu Sanma only cultivated five mu of land, but he was also assigned one. Lu Wenzheng, Wang Quanfu, Wang Manxi, and Lu Sanhu four households were living in great difficulty, and were assigned one collectively. Lu Wenzheng was forced to sell nine mu of land.
    How much did these waterwheels really do? According to the investigation: the village has a total of 60 waterwheels, including the old ones. Last year, three of them were not used at all, and the remaining 57 only dealt with the "errand." Each averaged only 3.6 mu of land irrigated. But this spring, the County Cooperative again "pushed" 70 waterwheels to the Gaojiazhuang Joint Village Cooperative, which are still in the cooperative and have not been moved. The masses call waterwheels "black toads" and "money-grabbing donkeys."
    Let's talk about the well-digging situation. Last winter, county cadre Feng Laicheng and district cadre Gao Xi'en, without obtaining the consent of the masses, coordinated with village cadres to measure the land of the masses. Based on the 4,390 mu of beach land in the village, it was stipulated that a well should be dug every 70 steps long and 40 steps wide. The well-digging funds were apportioned to all 114 male laborers and 47 female laborers in the village, with 20,000 yuan per male and 10,000 yuan per female, totaling 2.75 million yuan. Those who dig get the well, those who do not dig pay, regardless of whether the landowners are willing or not. In order to make the wells "east-west aligned and north-south aligned," only 89 of the original 130 old wells in the village were counted. As a result, three wells were dug in the four mu vegetable garden of the old man Lang Sanze. Some 15 mu of wheat fields had ten wells dug in them, destroying many seedlings. The masses said: "Digging wells is like digging graves!" Because every household went to dig wells, those without labor had to spend money to buy wells, and those with labor dug wells to sell for money. All 166 wells dug in this way could not be used in the spring of this year, and 156 of them were backfilled.
    In addition, in 1952, the village also had 14 million yuan for fertilizer, 8 million yuan for water wells, 1.5 million yuan for seeds, 5 million yuan for expanding shares in the village supply and marketing cooperative, 1.1 million yuan for new-style walking plows, 700,000 yuan for books and newspapers, and 597,000 yuan for opera performances, all of which were forcibly apportioned by group, household, or land area. Wang Pingshun, a model worker in water conservancy in the village, had a total labor income of 5.2 million yuan for his family of seven last year, and paid only more than 560,000 yuan in public grain, but the nine expenses for waterwheels, walking plows, fertilizers, water wells, books, tuition, opera, medicine, and supply and marketing cooperative shares amounted to 3,230,300 yuan, leaving only 1,400,700 yuan. More than 100 of the 195 households in the village are in a similar situation.
    However, the county has long believed that Gaojiazhuang has "achieved" in promoting waterwheels, and even commended it in 1952; it was not until April of this year that the problem was discovered and work began to solve it.

### 潞城县人民政府盲目冒进  使高家庄的农民负担增加

    潞城县人民政府盲目冒进
    使高家庄的农民负担增加
    读者韩福旺来信：山西省潞城县人民政府去年盲目决定以五区高家庄村为全县“水车化”的典型村，强迫该村农民大量打井、购买水车等，农民负担很重，但却一点也没有收到“水车化”的好处。
    高家庄村共一百九十五户。一九五二年农业收入总值为三亿七千七百五十八万元，农业税折合三千九百二十万元，但全年用于打井、购买水车等的款项即高达一亿五千七百九十六万元，占农业总收入的百分之四十一点八，够该村交四年爱国公粮。在去年六、七两个月中，县里先后推去了四十六部水车，每部价洋二百三十万元。当时群众不愿购买。县农林科科员冯来成、五区民政助理员高系恩就向群众说：“一部水车，二百三十万元，能浇地二十亩，非买不行。”群众仍不愿买。于是他们就一连召开了九个晚上和整三天的群众会进行分配。王平顺等二十户农民每户被摊派了一部，理由是他们较富裕。农民武三马只种地五亩，但也给分配了一部。鹿文正、王全富、王满喜、鹿三虎四户生活很困难，伙摊派了一部。逼得鹿文正卖掉九亩地。
    这些水车究竟起了多大作用呢？据调查：该村连旧有的水车共有六十部，去年有三部根本没用，其余五十七部只应付了一下“差事”。每部平均只浇地三亩六分。但今年春季县社又给高家庄联村社“推去”水车七十部，直到现在仍存在社里动也未动。群众叫水车为“黑老蟆”“要钱驴”。
    再说打井的情况吧。去年冬季，县干部冯来成和区干部高系恩没有征得群众的同意，就协同村干部测量群众的土地，按全村四千三百九十亩滩地计算，规定每七十步长、四十步宽打井一眼。打井款按全村一百一十四个男劳力和四十七个妇女劳力摊派，男的每人两万元，女的每人一万元，共计二百七十五万元。打者得，不打者出，不管地户愿与不愿。为了使井“东西靠齐，南北对正”，全村原有的一百三十眼旧井，只有八十九眼算在数内。以至在郎三则老汉的四亩菜园地里打了三眼井。有的十五亩麦地里打了十眼井，毁坏了很多成苗。群众说：“打井是打墓子哩！”因为家家去打井，没劳力的只好花钱买井，有劳力的就打井卖钱。这样打出的一百六十六眼井，今年开春就全部不能使用，其中一百五十六眼被填埋。
    此外，该村在一九五二年还有肥料款一千四百万元，水井款八百万元，种籽款一百五十万元，村供销社社员扩大股金五百万元，新式步犁款一百一十万元，书报费七十万元，唱戏费五百九十七万元均是按组、按户或按地亩强迫摊派的。该村水利劳动模范王平顺，全家七口人，去年一年劳动收入总值是五百二十万元，出公粮仅五十六万多元，但出水车、步犁、肥料、水井、书报、学费、唱戏、药剂、供销社股金等九项开支就有三百二十三万零三千元，净剩一百四十万零七千元。类似这种情况，全村在一百九十五户中就有一百户以上。
    但是县里却长期认为高家庄推广水车有“成绩”，并曾在一九五二年作过表扬；直至今年四月份才发现问题，着手解决。
