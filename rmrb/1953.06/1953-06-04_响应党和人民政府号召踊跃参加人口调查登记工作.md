Reader's Letters Abstract

    Responding to the Call of the Party and the People's Government, Actively Participate in Population Census and Registration
    Liang Yimin from Liaoxi Provincial Normal College writes: After studying the "Instruction on Conducting a National Population Census and Registration in Preparation for General Elections" issued by the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government, I deeply realize that it is very necessary to conduct a nationwide population census and registration in preparation for general elections. Because through this population census and registration, we will not only know the exact number of the national population, which is conducive to our upcoming national general election work, but also learn how much labor force, how many young people, adults, and children there are in the country, as well as the distribution of our population, providing favorable conditions for our country's future planned large-scale economic construction and cultural construction. In old China, due to the reactionary rulers not working for the people, they never conducted a serious census and statistics of the national population, making it unclear to us exactly how many people there were in our country. The past saying that "China has a population of 400 million" was estimated from the amount of salt tax collected nationwide, and of course, it was not an accurate figure. However, conducting a nationwide population census and registration in such a large country as ours is indeed a very complex, meticulous, and arduous task. Therefore, it must be carried out under the leadership of the Party and the government, and with the mobilization of people from all walks of life across the country, to complete this great and glorious task. Therefore, I suggest that local people's governments at all levels across the country should attach importance to this instruction, organize staff to study it, and at the same time, actively pay attention to the cadres in their units who can do population census and registration work, and ask them to conduct in-depth study and research, so as to respond to the call of the Party and the government at any time and serve as glorious propagandists and investigators for the population census and registration work.

    响应党和人民政府号召踊跃参加人口调查登记工作
    辽西省师范专科学校梁懿民来信：我学习了中央人民政府政务院关于“为准备普选进行全国人口调查登记的指示”以后，深深地认识到为准备普选，在全国范围内进行一次普遍的人口调查登记，在目前来说是非常必要的。因为通过这次人口调查登记，不仅使我们知道全国人口的确切数字，以利我们即将开始的全国普选工作，而且可以通过这次调查，使我们知道全国有多少劳动力，有多少青年、壮年和儿童，以及我国人口的分布情况，为我们国家今后有计划的大规模经济建设和文化建设，提供有利的条件。在旧中国，由于反动统治者不为人民办事，对全国的人口始终未进行过一次认真的调查统计，使我们对自己国家到底有多少人口弄不清楚，过去所谓“中国人口四万万”的说法，是由全国所收盐税的金额推算出来的，当然不是确切的数字。但是，要在我们这样大的国家内，进行一次全国范围的人口调查登记，确是一个十分复杂细致而艰巨的任务，因此必须在党与政府的领导下，全国各阶层人民动员起来，才能完成这一伟大而光荣的任务。所以我建议全国各级地方人民政府，应重视这一指示，并组织工作人员进行学习，同时应主动注意本单位能作人口调查登记工作的干部，要他们进行深入的学习研究，以便随时响应党和政府的号召，充当人口调查登记工作的宣传员和调查员的光荣任务。
