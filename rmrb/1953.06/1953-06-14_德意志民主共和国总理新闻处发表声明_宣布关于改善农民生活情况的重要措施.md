Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, June 12th (TASS dispatch): The Press Office under the Premier of the German Democratic Republic, Grotewohl, issued a statement. The statement said:

    The government of the German Democratic Republic has noted that recently the government of the Republic has made some mistakes in dealing with the issues of rich peasants and middle peasants. These mistakes are manifested in: decisions regarding wasteland and loans, some special measures concerning supply departments, strict taxation systems, and the neglect of individual farmers by machine and tractor stations. The statement pointed out that serious mistakes were also made in the implementation of the above decisions in various places, resulting in farmers abandoning their estates. The statement declared that the government of the German Democratic Republic has ordered the cancellation of these decisions that hinder the development of farmers' production.

    The government, based on the suggestions put forward at the joint meeting of representatives of working farmers, agricultural production cooperatives, machine and tractor stations, and representatives of the Central Committee of the German Socialist Unity Party, has ordered the prohibition of control over farmers who cannot pay products and taxes in full.

    Farmers (small farmers, middle farmers, and rich farmers) who have abandoned their farms and fled to West Berlin and West Germany can return to their own farms. If this cannot be done in exceptional cases, they should be given full compensation.

    Returning farmers should be given assistance with loans and farm implements so that they can develop their own farms. The Farmers' Bank has the power to grant short-term loans to all farms.

    The legislative body will revise the regulations on the punishment of those who cannot pay products and taxes in full.

    Machine and tractor stations must help individual farmers with cultivation.

    The Minister of Agriculture and Forestry and the State Secretary for Agriculture and Procurement have been instructed to take all necessary measures to guarantee the interests of agricultural production cooperatives.

    德意志民主共和国总理新闻处发表声明
    宣布关于改善农民生活情况的重要措施
    【新华社十三日讯】据塔斯社柏林十二日讯：德意志民主共和国总理格罗提渥领导下的新闻处发表了一个声明。声明说：
    德意志民主共和国政府注意到，最近以来共和国政府在对待富农和中农的问题上犯了若干错误。这些错误表现在：关于荒地和贷款问题的决定，关于供应部门的一些特殊措施，严格的征税制度，以及机器与拖拉机站忽视个体农民的态度等。声明指出，各地在执行上述决定时也犯了严重错误，结果，农民抛弃了他们的庄园。声明宣称，德意志民主共和国政府已下令取消这些阻碍农民生产发展的决定。
    政府并根据劳动农民、农业生产合作社、机器与拖拉机站的代表们和德国统一社会党中央委员会的代表们所举行的联席会议上提出的建议，下令禁止对不能如数缴纳产品和付出税款的农民实行管制。
    抛弃了他们的田庄跑到西柏林和西德去的农民（小农、中农与富农）可以重新回到他们自己的田庄。如果在例外的情况下不能做到这一点，应给予他们充分的补偿。
    对回来的农民应给予贷款和农具的帮助，使他们可以发展自己的庄园。农民银行有权力给予所有的庄园以短期贷款。
    立法机关将修正关于对不能如数缴纳产品和缴纳税款的人的处罚的规定。
    机器与拖拉机站必须帮助个体农民耕作。
    农林部长与农业与采购国务秘书已接到指示，负责采取一切必要措施以保证农业生产合作社的利益。
