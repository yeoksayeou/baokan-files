People's Daily Editorial Department:

    In the news I exposed regarding Wang Zhenhai's violations of law and discipline, published in the People's Daily on January 19th, some of the specific details do not align with the actual situation. This is due to my usual careless and sloppy work style, which should serve as a warning for the future. I now make the following corrections to the main details that do not match the actual situation:

    (1) Regarding the victim Li Xiaoliu's situation: (1) Li Xiaoliu studied at the Rural Normal School in Wuqi County, not at the "Dingxian Simple Normal School"; (2) In 1931, Li Xiaoliu was arrested and detained for three months by the Kuomintang government for participating in the student movement struggle led by our party, not "imprisoned for several years"; (3) On the 26th day of the ninth lunar month in 1944, the enemy arrested Li Xiaoliu, who had been dispatched by our side to work as an intelligence officer in the Zhengding puppet security army, and he was not released until the 15th day of the seventh lunar month in 1945 after the Japanese surrendered, for a total of ten months, not "imprisoned for several years"; (4) In 1947, Li Xiaoliu rejoined the party in the village and served as the village head, but he did not serve as a "member of the Dongniu Village Branch Committee."

    (2) Regarding Zhang Ying and her family situation: (1) Zhang Ying's family used to be a large landlord in Dongniu Village, owning more than 200 mu of land, and was reduced to a middle peasant family after 1933. Therefore, it was incorrect for me to say that her family's class status was landlord during the land reform; (2) In the "Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries" movement in 1951, Zhang Ying's sister-in-law reported to the Wuqi County Public Security Bureau that Li Xiaoliu had colluded with the enemy to kill her husband, Li Shuoyan (who was our party's district committee secretary; Li Shuoyan's death was actually unrelated to Li Xiaoliu). Zhang Ying herself did not "in the capacity of a Communist Party member," take a complaint to the Wuqi County Public Security Bureau to accuse Li Xiaoliu.

    (3) In my letter, I said: "Originally, Wang Zhenhai instructed the Wuqi County Committee to notify the County People's Government to sentence Li Xiaoliu to death immediately... After Wang Zhenhai issued the instruction, hearing inquiries from various parties regarding this incident, it was temporarily changed to a suspended execution, and he secretly reported to the Hebei Provincial Committee, deceiving the Provincial Committee into approving it." This is not consistent with the facts. The actual situation is: In April 1951 (during the Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries movement), Wang Zhenhai went to Wuqi County without informing the prefectural committee to arrange for handling Li Xiaoliu. After Wang Zhenhai's instructions, the Wuqi County Committee blindly, based on the "criminal facts" of Li Xiaoliu introduced by Wang Zhenhai, included Li Xiaoliu in the list of counter-revolutionary criminals sentenced to death with a reprieve, and submitted it to the prefectural committee for approval in May. Wang Zhenhai personally reviewed Li Xiaoliu's case file materials, and on June 2, 1951, he personally took a batch of cases to Hebei Province to report them (including Li Xiaoliu). When reporting the case, he also concealed the fact that Li Xiaoliu was an intelligence officer dispatched by our side, thus deceiving the province into approving it (approving the arrest, and deciding the case after interrogation and verification).

    (4) The mistake of the Dingxian Prefectural Committee in the Wang Zhenhai incident is: severely losing the party's principles, treating this serious issue with an extremely wrong, corrupt, liberal, and conciliatory attitude, playing a role in shielding and condoning the anti-party element Wang Zhenhai. It was not, as I said, that they treated this issue with "personal feelings, hometown connections, and sectarianism," nor did they "organize small cliques" as I said. This statement is somewhat exaggerated and therefore incorrect.

### 范文兴关于揭发王振海事件的几点更正

    范文兴关于揭发王振海事件的几点更正人民日报社编辑部：
    一月十九日人民日报公布的我所揭发的王振海违法乱纪的消息中，有某些具体情节和实际情况不符。这是由于我平日粗枝大叶、马虎了草的工作作风所造成的，值得今后引起警惕。现将其中和实际情况不符的几个主要情节作如下更正：
    （一）关于受害人李小六的情况：（1）李小六曾在无极县城内乡村师范读书，不是在“定县简易师范”读书；（2）一九三一年李小六因参加我党所领导的学潮斗争，被国民党政府逮捕扣押三个月，不是“入狱达数年之久”；（3）一九四四年旧历九月二十六日敌人将被我方派遣至正定伪治安军中作情报工作的李小六逮捕，直到一九四五年旧历七月十五日日寇投降后始被释放，时间共十个月，不是“监禁数年”；（4）一九四七年李小六曾在本村重新入党并担任村长职务，但未任“东牛村支部委员会委员”职务。
    （二）关于张英及其家庭情况：（1）张英的家庭，在过去曾是东牛村拥有二百多亩土地的大地主，一九三三年后降为中农。因此我说她家土地改革时是地主成份是不对的；（2）张英的嫂子在一九五一年“镇压反革命”运动中，向无极县公安局控告李小六曾勾结敌人杀害了她丈夫李硕彦（系我党区委书记，李硕彦遇害实与李小六无关）。张英本人并没有“以共产党员的身份”，携控诉状到无极县公安局控诉李小六。
    （三）我的信上曾说：“原来王振海指示无极县委通知县人民政府对李小六判处死刑立即执行的……，王振海的指示发出后，听到各方面对这一事件的责询，临时改为缓期执行，又亲自秘密报告河北省委，骗取了省委的批准。”这是不符合事实的。实际情况是：王振海在一九五一年四月（正值镇压反革命运动中）曾瞒着地委亲赴无极县，布置搞李小六。无极县委在王振海此次指示后，便盲目根据王振海所介绍的李小六的“罪恶事实”，将李小六列入死刑缓期执行的反革命罪犯的名单中，于五月报送地委审批。王振海亲自审阅了李小六的案卷材料，于一九五一年六月二日亲自携带一批案件赴河北省报案（其中有李小六），报案时又同样隐瞒了李小六当情报员系我方派遣这一事实，因而骗得省的批准（批准逮捕，经审讯证实后再行定案）。
    （四）定县地委会在王振海事件中的错误是：严重丧失党的原则，以极端错误的腐朽的自由主义、调和主义态度对待这一严重问题，起了包庇纵容反党分子王振海的作用。还不是像我所说的，他们是以“私人感情、乡里观念及宗派主义”对待此一问题，也没有像我所说的“组织小的集团”。这种说法是有些夸大的，因而是不对的。范文兴
