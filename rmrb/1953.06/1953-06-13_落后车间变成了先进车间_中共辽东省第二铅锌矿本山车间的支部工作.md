　　A Backward Workshop Transformed into an Advanced Workshop
　　——The Branch Work of the Benshan Workshop of the No. 2 Lead-Zinc Mine in Liaodong Province of the Chinese Communist Party
　　After rectification and learning from the experience of the 53 Factory, the Benshan Workshop Branch of the No. 2 Lead-Zinc Mine in Liaodong Province of the Chinese Communist Party, emphasized the Party's political and ideological leadership, improved the consciousness of Party members and the labor enthusiasm of the workers, and transformed a backward workshop into an advanced workshop. Before the rectification, Party members accounted for nine percent of the total number of employees at that time. The branch's ideological leadership was very poor, and its organizational life was also very lax. As a result, some Party members did not play a significant role in production. The better Party members could only work silently, and some Party members did not work well themselves, but criticized the masses for not producing well. Therefore, the masses had many opinions about the branch. The administrative cadres also did not understand how to rely on the working class and use persuasion and education to lead production, but used disguised coercion or appeasement to maintain production. For example, seeing that workers had too many absences, they stipulated that anyone who did not return after the deadline would be fined cigarettes and apples; fearing that the task would not be completed, they invited production groups with good performance to eat dumplings and large bowls of noodles. As a result, the workers' labor morale was not high, labor discipline was lax, absenteeism was rampant, and production tasks could not be completed frequently. In 1952, the production task was not completed in five months.
　　After rectification and learning from the work experience of the 53 Factory, the Party branch also initially learned the method of ensuring and supervising production and strengthened the Party's political work, thus greatly promoting production. Comparing the production in February 1953 after the rectification with the production in September 1952 before the rectification, level prospecting increased by 15.5 percent, preparation increased by 37.7 percent, and mining increased by 9.8 percent. The workers' labor morale was very high. The phenomenon of absenteeism and laxity in the past no longer exists.
　　The branch has the following characteristics in carrying out political and ideological education:
　　First, in light of the ideological situation inside and outside the Party, and in conjunction with current production work, carry out education on communism, the Communist Party, and the eight standard conditions for Party members, and adhere to a regular Party lesson education system. For example, during the discussion of the national production plan, there was a relatively common conservative ideology inside and outside the Party, emphasizing objective difficulties and hindering the formulation of an advanced production plan. At this time, the branch conducted education based on the second and third of the eight standard conditions for Communist Party members, targeting this conservative ideology. It explained the relationship between today's large-scale economic construction and the realization of communism, and pointed out the attitude that Communist Party members should have towards today's discussion of the national production plan in the course of creating the great cause of communist society. In this way, the lofty ideals of Communist Party members are closely linked with current work, so that every Party member understands that overcoming all difficulties and completing the national production plan is to create conditions for realizing communism, which is what a Communist Party member should do. This also gave each Party member concrete content when making ideological self-examination. Party member Cao Fengtang examined himself and said: During the rectification and study, although he understood that communist society would not come by waiting, but must be led by the vanguard of the working class to lead the masses, give play to labor enthusiasm and creativity, and strive hard to arrive. However, in this discussion of the national production plan, I did not use my brain to find ways to overcome difficulties and improve production efficiency, but bowed my head in the face of difficulties and forgot that I was a Communist Party member. The Party members who managed the wind pressure machine also examined the reasons for the insufficient wind pressure and expressed that they would definitely correct it in the future. Party members from other work sections also put forward advanced plans one after another. In addition to carrying out normal Party lesson education, the branch also seized every opportunity to conduct education on socialist large-scale production anytime and anywhere. For example, when using advanced production tools, they publicize the prospects of production mechanization and encourage everyone to work actively and strive to replace the current physical labor with machines in the future. When implementing the employee health care system, they organize them to discuss the comparison between the new and old societies and explain the consistency between developing production and improving life. From these practical issues, Party members and the masses of workers gradually realized that they had indeed become the masters of the mine, and they gave even greater play to their enthusiasm for labor production.
　　Second, deeply understand the ideological situation of Party members and workers, and correctly solve the ideological problems of backward workers. There were a few Party members and workers in the workshop who showed a negative and weary attitude towards production, so some people believed that these people could not make progress and advocated transferring their work or even expelling them. In order to solve this problem, the branch conducted an in-depth investigation. It found that there were many reasons for this: some were because of life difficulties; some were burdened with the baggage of "qualifications" and complained that the superiors had not reused or promoted him; and some were due to too much criticism and accusations from the leadership, which led to dissatisfaction. The branch specifically analyzed these ideas, based on the principle of striving for education, and adopted different methods according to different situations to conduct patient talks and education. As a result, most of them have changed. The branch deeply realized that in dealing with workers who are temporarily backward, one should adopt the methods of active education and patient persuasion to overcome their backward ideas. For example, frequently summarizing the advanced ideas of advanced workers in production, establishing role models, and calling on them to learn from advanced workers is one of the methods of active education. Once, the branch discovered that youth league member Yu Deshui was very active in production and showed the attitude of a master everywhere. So the branch helped him summarize his thoughts. It turned out that under the rule of the puppet Manchukuo, he was a miner in the mine, and he was beaten and scolded all day long, and he couldn't even earn a pair of shoes. After liberation, under the leadership of the Communist Party, life has risen step by step. He said: "In order to defend the happy life of the masters and build a better tomorrow, we must actively produce." When the branch asked Yu Deshui to make an ideological report to the workshop staff, many Party members and workers listened to it and automatically made ideological comparisons with him. Worker Liu Yongzhang was moved to tears, and he said: "I suffered the same hardship as Yu Deshui in the past. Now my life has improved, but my performance in production is not as good as Yu Deshui. I often complain. Isn't this forgetting my roots?" He wiped away his tears and publicly vowed to "resolutely correct it."
　　Third, through the branch's expanded meeting, organize cadres to study the instructions of the superior, criticize wrong ideas, and unify the thoughts and actions of the Party, government, labor union, and youth league cadres. When discussing the national production plan at the branch's expanded meeting, some cadres reflected: "The quota is too high and cannot be completed." Therefore, they advocated setting the quota lower, which would not only complete the task, but also be able to overfulfill the task. In the discussion, everyone analyzed the specific situation at the time and unanimously believed that the conditions for completing the task were available. Specifically, after the rectification, the ideological awareness and labor enthusiasm of Party members and workers have been significantly improved, and some production teams have greatly exceeded the quota. As long as the Party, government, labor union, and youth league cadres have the same understanding, resolutely fight against conservative ideas, formulate specific plans, and carry them out separately, then this year's production plan can be completed. In order to ensure the completion of the production task, the branch paid attention to the following work in the production process: First, pay attention to giving play to the organizational role of the Party. At the beginning of each month, the branch puts forward specific measures for the Party to ensure production in light of the key issues in production. Party members formulate personal guarantee plans according to the instructions of the branch, which has played a great role in completing the production task. Second, strengthen the ties between the Party and the masses, and pay attention to cultivating activists through various movements and current work, absorbing them to participate in branch meetings, so that they can act together with Party members and strive together to complete the production task. Third, strictly organize life, and hold branch meetings and group meetings twice a month. At these Party meetings, carry out criticism and self-criticism, check and summarize work, commend good ones, criticize bad ones, and constantly improve the ideological awareness of Party members.
　　There are still some shortcomings in the work of the Benshan Workshop Branch, mainly the lack of specific leadership over the labor union and the youth league. Therefore, the organizational role of the labor union and the youth league has not been fully played. This is what we should pay attention to in the future.

    落后车间变成了先进车间
    ——中共辽东省第二铅锌矿本山车间的支部工作
    中共辽东省第二铅锌矿本山车间支部，经过整党和学习五三工厂的经验以后，重视了党的政治思想领导，提高了党员觉悟和工人群众的劳动热情，使落后车间变为先进车间。在整党前，这个支部的党员占当时职工总数的百分之九。支部的思想领导很差，组织生活也很松懈，因之有的党员在生产中作用不大。较好的党员也只能闷着头干，也有的党员自己不好好工作，却批评群众不好好生产，因此，群众对支部有很多意见。行政干部也不懂得依靠工人阶级，用说服教育的方法来领导生产，而是用变象强迫或拉拢的方法来维持生产。如看到工人欠勤过多，就规定凡过期不回来的就罚他香烟和苹果；怕完不成任务，就请生产好的小组吃饺子和大碗面。因之，工人劳动情绪不高，劳动纪律松懈，旷工很多，经常不能完成生产任务，一九五二年就有五个月没有完成生产任务。
    经过整党并学习了五三工厂的工作经验，党支部也初步学会了保证监督生产的方法，加强了党的政治工作，因此，大大推动了生产。以整党后一九五三年二月的生产和整党前一九五二年九月对比，水平探矿提高百分之十五点五，采准提高百分之三十七点七，采矿提高了百分之九点八。工人们劳动情绪很高。过去旷工松懈的现象再也不存在了。
    支部在进行政治思想教育方面，有以下几个特点：
    一、针对党内外的思想情况，结合当前生产工作，进行共产主义、共产党和党员标准八项条件的教育，坚持经常性的党课教育制度。比如，在讨论国家生产计划期间，党内外比较普遍地存在着一种保守思想，强调客观困难，阻碍着先进生产计划的制订。这时，支部便根据共产党员标准八项条件的第二和第三两条的内容，针对这种保守思想进行教育。说明今天大规模的经济建设和实现共产主义的关系，指出共产党员在创造共产主义社会伟大事业的途程中，对待今天讨论国家生产计划应有的态度。这样，把共产党员的远大的理想和当前的工作密切联系起来，使每个党员懂得克服一切困难，完成国家生产计划，就是为了创造条件，实现共产主义，就是共产党员应该作的事。这也使每个党员作思想检查时有了具体内容。党员曹凤堂检查自己说：在整党学习时，虽然懂得了共产主义社会不是等待而来的，必须由工人阶级的先锋队带领广大群众，发挥劳动积极性和创造性，努力争取才能到来。但是在这次讨论国家生产计划中，自己却没有开动脑筋，找寻窍门，克服困难，提高生产效率，而是在困难面前低了头，忘记了自己是一个共产党员。管理风压机的党员们，也检查出风压不够用的原因，表示今后一定要改正。其他各工段的党员，也都纷纷订出了先进计划。支部除了进行正常的党课教育以外，还抓紧一切时机，随时随地进行社会主义大生产的教育。比如在使用先进生产工具时，就向他们宣传生产机械化的远景，鼓励大家积极工作，争取将来全部用机器来代替现在的体力劳动。在实行职工保健制度时，便组织他们座谈新旧社会的对比，讲解发展生产和改善生活的一致性。党员和工人群众从这些实际问题中，逐渐体会到自己确实变成了矿山的主人，更加发挥劳动生产热情。
    二、深入了解党员和工人的思想情况，正确地解决落后工人的思想问题。该车间曾有少数党员和工人对生产表现着消极疲塌的情绪，于是有人便认为这些人不可能进步了，主张调动他们的工作，甚至把他们开除出去。支部为了解决这个问题，进行了深入的调查。发现其中原因很多：有的是因为生活困难；有的是背着“资历”的包袱，埋怨上级没有重用或提拔他；还有的是由于领导上对他批评和指责多了些，存在着不满情绪。支部具体地分析了这些思想、根据争取教育的方针，从不同的情况出发，采取不同的方式，进行耐心的谈话和教育，结果，大都有了转变。支部深深体会到：对待暂时表现落后的工人，克服他们的落后思想，应该采取积极教育、耐心说服的办法。如经常总结生产中先进工作者的先进思想，树立榜样，号召他们向先进工作者看齐，就是积极教育办法之一。有一次，支部发现青年团员于德水，在生产中非常积极，处处表现了主人翁的态度。支部于是帮助他总结思想。原来他在伪满统治下，自己在矿山当矿工，终日挨打受骂，连双鞋都挣不上。解放以后，在共产党的领导下，生活才步步上升。他说：“为了保卫幸福的主人翁的生活，建设更美好的明天，就必须积极生产。”当支部让于德水向车间职工作思想报告时，许多党员和工人听了，都自动地和他作了思想对照。工友刘永章被感动的流下泪来，他说：“我过去和于德水一样受苦，现在我的生活改善了，但对生产的表现却没有于德水好，常常发牢骚，这不是忘了本了吗。”他擦着眼泪，当众宣誓“坚决改正”。
    三、通过支部扩大会议，组织干部学习上级指示，批判错误思想，统一党、政、工、团干部的思想和行动。在支部扩大会上讨论国家生产计划时，有的干部反映：“定额太高，不能完成。”因此，他们主张把定额订得低一点，不仅可以完成任务，而且还能够超额完成任务。在讨论中，大家分析了当时的具体情况，一致认为具备了完成任务的条件。具体表现在整党以后，党员和工人的思想觉悟和劳动积极性都有显著的提高，而且有的生产小组已经大大地超过了定额。只要党、政、工、团干部认识一致，坚决和保守思想作斗争，订出具体计划，分头进行贯彻，那么，今年的生产计划是可以完成的。为了保证生产任务的完成，支部在生产过程中注意了下列的工作：首先注意发挥党的组织作用。在每一个月初，支部即针对生产中的关键问题，提出党保证生产的具体措施，党员根据支部指示，订出个人保证计划，这对完成生产任务起了很大作用。其次，加强党和群众的联系，注意通过各个运动和当前工作去培养积极分子，吸收他们参加支部大会，使他们和党员一道行动起来，为完成生产任务共同奋斗。其三，严密组织生活，每月召开两次支部大会和小组会。在这些党的会议上，开展批评和自我批评，检查和总结工作，表扬好的，批评坏的，不断地提高党员的思想觉悟。
    本山车间支部工作中，还存在着某些缺点，主要是对工会和青年团缺乏具体的领导，因而工会和青年团的组织作用，未能得到充分地发挥。这是今后须要注意的。
