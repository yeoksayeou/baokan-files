    The CCP Central Committee North China Bureau Formulates a Series of Measures to Overcome the "Five Excesses" Phenomenon and Improve Leadership

    [This newspaper reported] The CCP Central Committee North China Bureau, to systematically resolve the "Five Excesses" problem in rural work, sent a large number of cadres led by Comrade Wang Congwu to delve into rural areas to understand the specific situation and inspect the work during March and April this year. In early May, the North China Bureau held five consecutive enlarged meetings. Based on the instructions of the CCP Central Committee, and according to the principles of Comrade Mao Zedong's article "Some Questions Concerning Methods of Leadership," combined with the struggle against bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of law and discipline, and in the spirit of self-criticism, the meetings repeatedly studied the actual situation of various rural tasks, carefully analyzed the "Five Excesses" phenomenon in rural work and its sources. After heated discussions, several basic methods for improving the Party's leadership over rural work were stipulated.

    The meeting unanimously agreed that under the leadership of the great leader Chairman Mao, the Party organizations and the people of North China have achieved great successes in social reform and the overall economic recovery work over the past four years. The level of agricultural production and the degree of "organization" have greatly improved; the production conditions and living conditions of farmers have also improved considerably; cultural, health, and other conditions have also undergone significant changes; the state of the Party's grassroots organizations and the work style of grassroots Party and government cadres are constantly improving, thus further strengthening the ties between the Party, the people's government, and the masses. The worker-peasant alliance is developing on the existing foundation and under new conditions, making the conditions for the Party and the people's government to lead the peasant masses into planned economic construction increasingly enhanced. These achievements are the main and fundamental aspects of rural work and must be affirmed. However, after studying some aspects of rural work, the meeting also pointed out that we must not be complacent with these achievements. We must realistically recognize that in implementing the Party's correct rural policies, certain errors and shortcomings still exist in some specific measures, causing dissatisfaction among some farmers. The most prominent problem since the beginning of this year is a series of problems arising from the excessive and over-hasty tasks set by higher authorities, such as too many meetings, too many forms, too much training, too many organizational titles, and too many concurrent positions for village and township cadres—the "Five Excesses" problem. This not only increases many difficulties for district and township cadres but has also affected agricultural production. In the mutual aid and cooperation movement, the principle of voluntary mutual benefit was violated, blind pursuit of numbers, greed for more and bigger, and forced accumulation of public property occurred. In terms of supplying means of production, forced sales were implemented, creating a burden. The meeting believed that these errors and shortcomings must be treated seriously and conscientiously overcome.

    The meeting analyzed that the main responsibility for the above shortcomings lies with the leading organs, and rural cadres cannot be blamed. The direct causes are mainly the following three aspects: First, when deciding on tasks, many leading organs only look at needs and not at possible conditions, showing blind enthusiasm and wanting to accomplish good things all at once. Some people have also been blinded by victory, overestimating subjective initiative and favorable conditions, thinking that anything they want to do can be done with just an order. Related to this is the growth among many comrades of a careless, casual, and grandiose work style since the national liberation. They write tasks and request materials with a turn of their minds, but they do not carefully consider whether they can be accomplished. These all come from the impatience and fanaticism of the petty bourgeoisie, subjectivism in thinking, and a violation of the principles of seeking truth from facts and acting according to needs and possibilities, which Chairman Mao has repeatedly instructed. Second, when assigning tasks to rural areas, Party and government leading organs often neglect or even forget the current characteristics of the small-peasant economy, excessively emphasize uniformity and planning, and interfere too much with the peasants. Therefore, in practice, they also ignore the complexity and long-term nature of transforming the small-peasant economy, and instead of attracting peasants to organize themselves and improve farming methods through typical demonstrations based on the principle of voluntary mutual benefit, they use various methods to force the masses into mutual aid and cooperation, ordering the promotion of advanced experiences, and subjectively demanding high percentages and large organizations, only caring about exaggeration and not seeking practical results. The result can only be to make peasants doubt agricultural production cooperatives, seriously affecting and even disrupting the normal progress of agricultural production. In addition, the inherent vulnerability of the small-peasant economy is underestimated, while the recovery of its economic strength is overestimated. The living standards of peasants in a few economic crop areas are often used to infer the general situation, resulting in the supply of means of production that exceed their needs and capabilities, and forcing them to purchase through administrative means. The differences between various regions are also often neglected, so in terms of task requirements and working methods, the problems of uniformity and formalism are also committed. Third, after entering the city, leading organs at all levels and in all systems do not understand the rural areas they once knew well. Higher-level organs are busy signing documents, setting tasks, making plans, writing instructions, and creating forms, mechanically transporting advanced experiences, which greatly increases bureaucracy and paperwork. Organs below the county level are busy receiving and sending documents, reading instructions, running errands to convey messages, holding meetings to arrange things, urging for numbers, and filling out forms to write reports. This creates a situation of busywork from top to bottom. In addition, the large-scale transfer of cadres last year weakened the leadership strength in some areas, which also had a certain impact.

    In order to correct these shortcomings, the meeting, after discussion, stipulated the following measures:

    First, review and rearrange rural tasks, changing the current phenomenon of too many tasks and some tasks being required too hastily. In 1953, in addition to agricultural production as the overriding central task, rural work should roughly determine the division of townships and township elections as the second most important task, and education work as the third most important task. The tasks of steadily consolidating primary schools and crash literacy courses should be re-examined in terms of requirements. Urban-rural material exchange conferences should be held in a planned way in coordination with rural production. The work of developing Party and League members should be taken as a regular task of Party and League branches. Health work, rectification of village finances, suppression of counter-revolutionaries, implementation of the Marriage Law, current affairs propaganda, etc., should all be taken as regular rural work, with the relevant departments seriously studying and making plans, and then proceeding in a step-by-step manner after necessary unified arrangements. Books, newspapers, waterwheels, fertilizers, etc., should be supplied in a planned manner according to the actual needs of farmers, but forced sales should not be carried out through administrative orders.

    Second, clean up the numerous types of organizational forms, meetings, training, etc. Various committees and offices currently established in counties, districts, and villages should be abolished if their tasks have been completed; those that are useless to keep and beneficial to abolish should be resolutely abolished, and all tasks should be the responsibility of the relevant departments; temporary committees that do not play a role should be terminated immediately; other committees that are indeed established to concentrate forces and facilitate coordination should be retained separately and their work improved. Patriotic Inspection Days played an important role in the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement. In the future, those who wish to continue this system must closely integrate it with production and daily work, but farmers must not be forced to hold them. In addition, county and district meetings of township cadres should also be uniformly regulated and not be held too often. If they need to be held, they must be well prepared and truly solve problems. Some problems can be solved by county and district cadres going down to convey messages and help with the work.

    Third, it is recommended to re-examine agricultural production indicators and revise excessively high and large production increase targets. Agricultural production plans are undoubtedly necessary as a control figure for leading organs. However, for farmers, any indicator can only be a guiding goal for farmers' efforts through price policies and necessary and feasible economic and political work. Farmers cannot be forced to make plans and act according to plans by administrative means. Digging wells and opening canals, promoting new-style plows, etc., are all necessary, but must be carried out under the principle of voluntary participation by farmers.

    Fourth, realize the Party's unified leadership, overcome bureaucracy, and oppose decentralism. In addition to making overall arrangements for the work of the whole year, Party committees at all levels must also make unified arrangements for the work of each period, with a clear focus and also taking care of the regular work of various departments. To this end, Party committees at all levels must improve their institutions, strengthen collective leadership, and all major tasks must be formally discussed in meetings, and after decisions are passed, they must be checked in an organized and purposeful manner. The main responsible persons must personally go deep into rural areas, factories, mines, schools, and other grassroots units to understand the situation, explain policies and working methods, and summarize experiences. In strengthening inspection work, we must pay attention to opposing decentralism and the practice of random inspections that are neither planned nor targeted.

    The Standing Committee of the North China Bureau unanimously believes that after focusing on solving the problem of rural leadership, it is important to organize inspection work, and in in-depth inspection work, to discover the creations of lower-level cadres and the masses, summarize their experiences, improve work, and use this to continuously enrich the experience of leading organs. This is very important.

    Comrade Liu Lantao, Third Secretary of the North China Bureau, emphasized the following points in the summary of the meeting:

       (1) The excessive number of rural tasks and the "leftist" adventurous tendencies in the mutual aid and cooperation movement are caused by the subjectivist thinking, bureaucratic work style, and decentralist tendencies of the leading organs, which are extremely harmful to the work and must be resolutely corrected and cannot be tolerated to continue. However, we must never treat what must be done, should be done, and can be done as part of the "excessive" part. It seems that there is such an atmosphere now: daring not to issue necessary instructions, daring not to ask for necessary statistics, daring not to talk about production competitions, mutual aid teams, and the development of agricultural production cooperatives, and even feeling that only one or two tasks can be done in rural areas, and nothing else can be done, and doing anything else becomes "Five Excesses." This kind of extreme attitude of not analyzing and denying everything, and the phenomenon of not adopting a positive attitude to improve work, will inevitably commit the error of liquidationism and is extremely harmful to the work.

    (2) When implementing the instructions of higher authorities, Party and government leading organs at all levels must grasp the characteristics of the work in their own regions, analyze various situations, and make specific arrangements. If individual tasks or practices are not suitable for the conditions of the region, they should actively put forward their opinions in the spirit of being responsible to the higher authorities and to the masses; it is wrong to force things down if they cannot be implemented. However, this is by no means opposing centralized leadership, nor can it become an excuse for localists.

       (3) The important weapon to ensure the realization of Chairman Mao's leadership method and working method is to carry out regular criticism and self-criticism, especially bottom-up criticism. We must use all effective methods to closely connect with the masses, go deep into the grassroots in a planned manner, inspect work, summarize work, and adhere to the study of theory and policy. As long as we earnestly do these things, our work will be done better than it is now. This time, we mastered sufficient materials in advance, analyzed and studied the actual situation in rural areas, and repeatedly discussed the method based on Chairman Mao's thought and the instructions of the Central Committee, that is, the method of combining theory with practice, which proved to be very effective and should be continued in the future.

    中共中央华北局定出一系列办法
    克服“五多”现象改进领导
    【本报讯】中共中央华北局为系统地解决农村工作中的“五多”问题，曾于今年三四月间，由王从吾同志率领大批干部，分别深入农村了解具体情况，检查工作。在五月初，华北局连续召开了五次扩大会议。会议根据中共中央的指示，根据毛泽东同志“关于领导方法的若干问题”一文的原则，结合反官僚主义、反命令主义、反违法乱纪斗争，以自我批评为主的精神，反复研究了农村各项工作的实际情况，仔细分析了农村工作中的“五多”现象及其来源，经过热烈讨论，规定了若干改进党对农村工作领导的基本办法。
    会议一致认为，华北的党组织和全体人民在伟大的领袖毛主席的领导下，四年多以来，在社会改革和全体规模的经济恢复工作中，已获得极大成绩，农业生产水平和“组织起来”的程度，都有很大提高；农民的生产条件和生活状况也有相当改善；文化、卫生等状况，亦有显著变化；党的基层组织状况和基层的党、政干部的作风，正在不断改进，因而党、人民政府与群众的联系进一步密切了，工农联盟正在已有的基础和新的条件下更加巩固地发展着，这就使得党和人民政府领导农民群众进入有计划的经济建设的条件日益增长了。这些成绩，是农村工作的主要的和根本的方面，必须加以肯定。但在研究了农村工作的某些情况后，会议同时指出：丝毫也不能以此成绩自满，我们必须实事求是地认识我们在执行党的正确的农村政策中，在某些具体措施上，还存在着若干错误与缺点，引起部分农民的不满。今年以来最突出的就是由于上级机关规定任务过多、过急所产生的一系列问题，如会议多、表格多、训练多、组织名目繁多，乡村干部兼职多等“五多”问题。不仅增加区乡干部很多困难，且已影响到农民生产。在互助合作运动中，违背自愿互利的原则，盲目追求数字，贪多求大，强迫积累公共财产；在供给生产资料方面，强行推销，形成负担。会议认为必须严正对待这些错误和缺点，认真加以克服。
    会议分析了产生以上缺点的主要责任是在领导机关，不能责备农村干部。其直接原因主要有以下三方面：第一、很多领导机关决定任务时，只看需要，不看可能条件，盲目热情，想把好事一下办完。还有些人被胜利冲昏了头脑，过高地估计主观能动性和有利条件，以为想办的事情，只要命令一下，就可办到。与此相连的是在全国解放以后，在不少同志中滋长着一种漫不经心、随随便便和好大喜功的作风，脑子一转，就写任务，要材料，但是能否办到，就考虑不周。这些都是出自小资产阶级的急躁性和狂热病，思想方法上的主观主义，违背了毛主席所一再指示的实事求是、根据需要与可能办事的原则。第二、党政领导机关向农村布置任务时，常常忽视甚至忘记了当前小农经济的特点，过分强调统一性和计划性，过多地干涉了农民，因此，在实践中也就忽视了改造小农经济的复杂性和长期性，不在自愿互利的原则下，用典型示范的方法吸引农民组织起来，改善耕作方法，而用种种办法强制群众互助合作，命令推广先进经验，并主观主义地要求百分比高高的，组织大大的，只顾夸张，不求实效，其结果，只能使农民对农业生产合作社发生疑虑，严重影响以至破坏了农业生产的正常进行。另外，对小农经济本质上的脆弱性估计不足，而对其经济力量的恢复却估计过高，往往以少数经济作物地区的农民生活水平来推论一般地区，以致供给超过他们需要的和力所能及的生产资料，用行政手段强迫购买。各种不同地区的差异性也常常被忽视，因而在任务要求和工作方法上也犯了千篇一律、形式主义的毛病。第三、各级各系统的领导机关，进城以后，对于曾经很熟悉的农村不甚了解，高级一点的机关忙于签署文件，定任务，做计划，写指示，制表格，机械地搬运先进经验，这样官僚主义与文牍主义就大为抬头。县以下机关则忙于收发文件，看指示，跑腿传达，开会布置，催要数字，填表格写报告。因而形成上下交忙的情况。此外去年大批抽调干部，某些地区削弱了领导力量，也有一定的影响。
    为纠正这些缺点，会议经讨论后定出如下办法：
    第一、审查并重新安排农村任务，改变当前任务过多及某些任务要求过急的现象。一九五三年的农村工作，除以农业生产为压倒一切的中心任务外，并大体确定以划乡和乡选为第二位工作，教育工作为第三位工作。稳步整顿小学、速成识字等任务，在要求上均应重新审定。城镇物资交流大会，应配合农村生产有计划的召开。发展党员、团员的工作应当作党和团的支部的经常任务。卫生工作、整顿村财政、镇压反革命、贯彻婚姻法、时事宣传等，均应当作农村经常工作，经主管部门认真研究做出计划，再经过必要的统一布置后有步骤地进行。书报及水车、肥料等，均应切实根据农民的需要，有计划地供给，但不能以行政命令方式强迫推销。
    第二、清理种类繁多的组织形式和会议、训练等。县、区、村目前已建立的各种委员会和办公室，任务已结束者，明令撤消；留之无用、去之有利者，坚决取消，所有任务应由主管部门负责；临时委员会不起作用者，应即结束；其他确为集中力量、便于配合工作而建立的委员会，须分别保留，并健全其工作。爱国检查日在抗美援朝运动中曾起过重要作用，今后凡愿继续维持此项制度者，必须和生产及日常工作紧密结合，但不得强迫农民举行。此外，县、区召集乡的干部会议亦应统一规定，不要过多，需要开的就一定要准备好、开好，真正解决问题。有些问题可采取县区干部下去传达与帮助工作的办法来解决。
    第三、建议重新核定农业生产的指标，修正过高过大的增产指标。农业生产计划，作为领导机关的一种控制数字，这无疑是必要的。但对农民来说，任何指标，只能是通过价格政策及必要的与可行的经济工作和政治工作，作为指导农民的奋斗目标，不能用行政手段强制农民作计划，按计划办事。打井开渠，推广新式步犁等均是必须做的，但必须在农民自愿原则下进行。
    第四、实现党的统一领导克服官僚主义，反对分散主义。各级党委除对全年工作做总的安排外，对每一时期工作也要统一部署，既要有明确的中心，又应照顾各部门的经常工作。为此，各级党委要健全机构，加强集体领导，一切重大工作，一定要经过会议正式讨论，通过决定后，要有组织有目的地进行检查，主要负责人要亲自深入农村、厂矿、学校等基层单位了解情况，交代政策与工作方法，总结经验。在加强检查工作中，必须注意反对分散主义，反对既无计划、又无目标的乱检查的做法。
    华北局常委会一致认为，在集中地解决了农村领导问题之后，重要的是组织检查工作，并在深入的检查工作中，发现下级干部和群众的创造，总结他们的经验，改进工作，并用此来不断地充实领导机关的经验，这是十分重要的。
    华北局第三书记刘澜涛同志在会议总结中，着重指出如下几点：
       （一）农村任务过多以及在互助合作运动中的
    “左”倾冒进倾向，这是由于领导机关的主观主义思想、官僚主义作风和分散主义倾向造成的，对工作的危害极大，必须坚决纠正，绝不能容忍其继续存在。但绝不要把必须做应该做而又可能做的也当成
    “过多”的部分，现在好像有这样一种空气：不敢发布必要的指示，不敢索要必需的统计数字，不敢谈生产竞赛、互助组和农业生产合作社发展的工作，甚至觉得在农村中仿佛只能做一件或两件工作，其他一律不能干了，一干就成了“五多”。这种不加分析、否定一切的极端态度，以及不采取积极态度改进工作的现象，必然会犯取消主义的错误，对工作极端有害。
    （二）各级党政领导机关，在执行上级指示时，必须掌握本地区工作特点，分析各种情况，作具体的布置。如遇个别工作或做法不适合本地区情况时，应本对上负责与对群众负责一致的精神，积极提出意见；既执行不通，硬往下推是不对的。但这样作，绝不是反对集中领导，更不能成为地方主义者的借口。
       （三）保证实现毛主席的领导方法和工作方法的重要武器是开展经常的批评与自我批评，特别是自下而上的批评。要用一切有效的办法密切联系群众，要有计划地深入下层，检查工作，总结工作，坚持理论政策学习。只要认真地做到了这些，我们的工作就会比现在做得好一些。这次会议，我们在事先掌握了充分的材料，分析和研究了当前农村的实际情况，依据毛主席的思想和中央的指示，进行反复讨论的方法，即理论与实际联系的方法，证明效果很好，今后应继续采用。
