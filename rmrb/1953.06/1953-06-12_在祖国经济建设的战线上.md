On the Economic Construction Front of the Motherland
Yanshan Mountain Area is a Rich Iron Ore Deposit of the Motherland
Xinhua News Agency: The 221st Exploration Team of the Ministry of Geology of the Central People's Government, after a year of investigation and research, has confirmed that the Yanshan Mountain area of Hebei Province is another rich iron ore deposit of the motherland.

The Yanshan iron ore layer stretches for hundreds of miles, mostly hematite formed by shallow-sea sedimentation during the Sinian period 600 million years ago. The quality of the iron is very good, and the total thickness of the ore layer reaches a maximum of 5.6 meters, some of which is exposed on the surface.

The 221st Exploration Team began exploration here in June 1952. In order to find iron ore, they crossed mountains and ridges. All the geological staff went through extensive surface surveys and trenching work, clarified the distribution of various rock formations, and repeatedly studied the influence of folds, faults, and deep-seated granite on iron ore in ancient geography and geological structure. They also collected more than 400 kinds of specimens such as hematite, chalcopyrite, malachite, quartzite, and ancient biological fossils.

Currently, large-scale exploration work is underway in the Yanshan area. The 221st Exploration Team has also sent out three teams for general survey, detailed survey, and physical prospecting to conduct exploration in the eastern part of the Yanshan Mountains.

Construction of a Huge Reservoir Project to Harness the Liao River Will Commence
Xinhua News Agency: The first huge project to harness the Liao River—the Dahuofang Reservoir project on the Hun River, a tributary of the Liao River—will officially commence on June 15.

This water conservancy project, which is primarily for flood control and also for benefiting the people, began preparations for various construction activities in February this year. Currently, auxiliary projects are being stepped up near the planned tunnel (aqueduct) project. The Hun River Bridge, which is more than 300 meters long and more than 6 meters wide, has also been successfully built. Now, cars and trucks, as well as tractors helping to transport equipment, are constantly running on it; soon, a double-track narrow-gauge railway will be added on top of it. The Dahuofang Reservoir project is located in Dahuofang Village in the suburban area of Fushun City, on a tributary of the Liao River. The entire project is expected to be completed in 1956. After the reservoir is completed, it will greatly reduce the threat of floods in the lower reaches of the Liao River; the industrial water supply for the industrial and mining areas such as Fushun and Shenyang along the Hun River can also be fully supplied, and part of the farmland on both banks can be irrigated.

Forestry Production in Yichun is Gradually Shifting to Mechanization
Xinhua News Agency: With the development of national economic construction, timber production in the Yichun Forestry Bureau has gradually shifted from manual labor-dependent handicraft production to mechanized production.

This year, in the production tasks of the Yichun Forestry Bureau, 60% of the log-collecting work will be replaced by tractors instead of animal power; most of the timber transportation work will also be carried out by tractors, automobiles, and forest railways, as well as semi-mechanized flatcars, while water transportation relying on natural conditions will only account for 29%. The work of manually hauling timber out of the river is also completely replaced by chain-saw-type river exit machines, tractors, and winches. Some lumberyards have also begun to use chain-saw-type loading platforms instead of manual loading.

After the implementation of mechanization in timber production, the work efficiency of the Yichun Forestry Bureau has been greatly improved. A Stalin-80 tractor can transport the equivalent of ten railway cars of timber, equivalent to the transportation capacity of eighty livestock. Therefore, although the timber production task has doubled year by year, on the contrary, a large number of manpower and livestock can be saved, and the cost of timber production is relatively reduced. At the same time, mechanized production has also created conditions for the realization of year-round operations. The bureau currently has ten logging workshops that have begun to implement year-round operations. In order to further implement mechanized production, the Yichun Forestry Bureau is preparing to try electric saws when harvesting timber this fall. After the successful testing and large-scale application of this logging machine, the entire production process of the bureau from logging to timber transportation will be fully realized by mechanized production.

Yanchang Oil Mine Greatly Increases Production
Xinhua News Agency: The Yanchang Oil Mine in northern Shaanxi has conscientiously implemented the oil extraction technical measures proposed by Soviet experts, and the total oil production in April and May has increased by more than two times compared with the total production in the first quarter of this year.

Soviet oil extraction experts came to the Yanchang Oil Mine in mid-March this year to assist in the work. After gaining an in-depth understanding of the various oil extraction technical measures and oil production effects of this oil mine in the past, he believed that adopting the method of blasting oil layers could increase the production of crude oil. The Yanchang Oil Mine adopted the suggestions of Soviet experts and invited him to work with technicians and oil extraction workers to conduct blasting experiments in three oil wells. As a result, the daily crude oil production of the entire mine doubled compared to before the blasting. They also tested the method of blasting empty wells among various blasting methods and found it to be the most effective, and suggested that it be promoted throughout the mine. Starting from April, the Yanchang Oil Mine conscientiously implemented this suggestion from Soviet experts. They compiled a yearly blasting schedule based on the conditions of each production well, and formulated safe operating procedures for blasting work and a progressive bonus system for exceeding oil production quotas. In April and May, blasting technical measures were carried out in a planned manner. The output of all blasted oil wells has increased tenfold to twentyfold, and the output of Well No. 3 in a certain location has even increased by one hundred and fourteen times compared to before the blasting.

Fushun No. 2 Petroleum Factory Begins Restoration
Xinhua News Agency: The Fushun No. 2 Petroleum Factory, which produces a large amount of synthetic petroleum, has begun restoration work this year. More than a thousand technicians and workers transferred from various places are carrying out intensive labor to restore this factory, which has been out of production for nearly eight years. The tall metal framework of the original ore workshop has already been erected. The temporary substation built specifically for the restoration project has been completed and will soon begin supplying power. Fourteen machinery and electrical manufacturing factories in Northeast China and inside the Customs are manufacturing various equipment and parts for this petroleum factory.

The Fushun No. 2 Petroleum Factory is one of China's large-scale synthetic petroleum factories. In the spring of 1946, the Kuomintang bandits stole a large number of important equipment from here, causing the factory to be paralyzed. In November 1948, the People's Government took over and carried out the work of cleaning up the existing equipment, etc. until May of this year, when it officially began restoration. After the project is fully completed, this factory will not only be able to produce a large amount of crude oil and diesel oil every year, but also be able to process diesel oil and gasoline for the Fushun No. 1 Petroleum Factory, which is opposite it, and produce a large amount of ammonium sulfate for use as agricultural fertilizer.

Xia Yi's Huai River Laborers Invest Surplus Wages in Production
Political Department Compilation Group of the Henan Provincial Huai River Harnessing Headquarters: 10,253 laborers from Xia Yi County, Henan, participated in the Huai River harnessing project, worked for 40 working days, and completed more than 430,000 cubic meters of earthwork for the spring project five days ahead of schedule in mid-May. They saved a total of more than 1.96 billion yuan in wages and various subsidies, and took them home to invest in production. They bought a total of 1,279 head of draught animals, 659 pigs and sheep, and 15,508 pieces of agricultural tools of various sizes such as carts, plows, harrows, sickles, ?, and brooms. At the same time, because this batch of surplus wages was taken home, it not only solved the living difficulties of more than 10,000 laborer families, but also provided mutual assistance and loans, and also solved the living difficulties of many other disaster-stricken households.

On May 17, Xia Yi County held a celebration and commendation meeting for 139 Huai River harnessing labor models and Huai River harnessing cadres. At this meeting, all unanimously passed a report to Chairman Mao on the victorious completion of the Huai River harnessing task five days ahead of schedule this spring, and expressed their infinite gratitude to Chairman Mao. They also reported on the situation of investing surplus wages in production and disaster relief. Finally, all unanimously expressed to Chairman Mao that they will always follow the Communist Party, resolutely complete the Huai River harnessing task, strive to eliminate harm and promote benefits, increase agricultural production, and strive for the happy life of the broad masses of people in the Huai River Basin and for the completion of the great construction of the motherland!

    在祖国经济建设的战线上
    燕然山地区是祖国的富饶铁仓
    中央人民政府地质部二二一勘探队经一年来的调查研究证实，河北省燕然山地区是祖国的又一个富饶的铁仓。
    燕然山铁矿层纵横蜿蜒数百里，大都是远在六万万年以前的震旦纪由浅海沉积下来的水成赤铁矿。铁的质量很好，矿层总厚度最高达五点六公尺，有的显露在外面。
    二二一勘探队是一九五二年六月开始到这里勘探的。他们为了寻找铁矿，翻山越岭，全体地质工作人员经过了浩繁的地面调查工作和槽探后，弄清了各种岩层的分布情形，并反复研究了古代地理、地质构造中的摺皱断层和深成花岗岩对铁矿影响的情况。他们还采集了赤铁矿、黄铜矿、孔雀石、石英岩、古生物化石等各样标本四百多种。
    现在，燕然山地区正在进行大规模的勘探工作，二二一勘探队还派出普查、详查、物理探矿三个队，分别到燕然山脉东部地区进行勘探。（新华社）
    根治辽河的巨大水库工程将动工
    根治辽河的第一个巨大工程——辽河支流浑河大火房水库工程，将在六月十五日正式开工。
    这一以防洪为主，借以兴利的水利工程，在今年二月就开始了各项施工的准备。目前，在计划最先开工的隧洞（输水道）工程附近，正加紧修建着附属工程。全长三百多公尺、宽达六公尺以上的浑河大木桥，也已修建成功。现在浑河两岸的汽车和大车，以及帮助运输器材的拖拉机不停地在上面奔驰着；不久，它的上面还要添铺双轨的轻便铁道。大火房水库工程，在辽河支流抚顺市郊区的大火房村。全部工程预计一九五六年结束。水库修成后，可使辽河下游的洪水威胁大大减轻；浑河沿岸的抚顺、沈阳等工矿区的工业用水也可得到充分供应，并能灌溉两岸的部分农田。    （据新华社讯）
    伊春林业生产逐渐转向机械化
    随着国家经济建设的发展，伊春森林工业局木材生产已由依靠体力劳动的手工业生产，逐步走向机械化生产。
    今年，伊春森林工业局的生产任务中，将有百分之六十的集材工作，由拖拉机代替畜力；运材工作也将大部由拖拉机、汽车和森林铁道以及半机械化平车来操作，靠自然条件的水运只占百分之二十九。用人力从河里向外曳运木材的工作，也完全由刀链式出河机、拖拉机和卷扬机代替操作。部分贮木场并已开始用刀链式装车台代替人力装车。
    木材生产实行机械化后，伊春森林工业局的工作效率大大提高。一台斯大林八十号拖拉机，能装运相等十个车皮的木材，顶八十头牲畜的运输能力。因此，虽然木材生产任务与年倍增，相反的却能节省大批人力、畜力，木材生产成本也相对的降低。同时，机械化生产也为实现常年作业创造了条件，该局目前已有十个伐木车间，开始实行常年作业。为了进一步实行机械化生产，伊春森林工业局已准备在今年秋天采伐木材时试用电锯。这一伐木机器试验成功和大量应用后，该局从伐木到运材的全部生产过程，将完全实现机械化生产。（新华社）
    延长油矿产量大大提高
    陕北延长油矿认真执行苏联专家提出的采油技术措施，四、五两月采油总量比今年第一季度的总量提高了两倍多。
    苏联采油专家今年三月中旬到延长油矿来协助工作。他深入了解这个油矿过去各种采油的技术措施和出油效果后，认为采用爆炸油层的办法，可以使原油的产量提高。延长油矿采用了苏联专家的建议，并请他协同技术人员和采油工人在三口油井中作了爆炸试验。结果，全矿原油日产量比爆炸前增加了一倍。他们并在各种爆炸方法中试验出空井爆炸的方法最为有效，建议在全矿推广。从四月份起，延长油矿认真贯彻苏联专家这个建议。他们根据各生产井情况，编排了全年爆炸程序表，订出了爆炸工作安全操作规程和采油超额累进奖励制度。四、五两月就有计划地进行了爆炸技术措施，凡爆炸过的油井产量都提高了十倍到二十倍，某地第三号井的产量甚至比爆炸前增加了一百一十四倍。（据新华社讯）
    抚顺石油二厂开始恢复
    大量出产人造石油的抚顺石油二厂今年已开始进行恢复工作。由各地调集来的千多名技术工人正在为恢复这座已停止生产将近八年的工厂展开紧张的劳动。原矿车间高大的金属房架已经耸立起来。专供恢复工程用电而修建的临时变电所已经完工，即将开始送电。东北和关内各地还有十四个机械和电器制造工厂给这座石油工厂制造各种设备和配件。
    抚顺石油二厂是我国规模宏大的人造石油工厂之一。一九四六年春天，国民党匪帮从这里盗走了大批重要设备，使这座工厂陷于瘫痪状态。一九四八年十一月，人民政府接管后就进行清理现有设备等工作，到今年五月，正式开始恢复。等到工程全部完成后，这座工厂每年除了可以生产大量原油和柴油以外，还可以为与它相对的抚顺石油一厂加工柴油、汽油，并大量出产作农业肥料用的硫酸錏。
