    Mobilize Women to Actively Participate in the General Election Movement
    Li Qiyang, Deputy Director of the Propaganda and Education Department of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation
    I. The general election movement, unprecedented in Chinese history, is about to begin. The Electoral Law promulgated by the Central People's Government clearly stipulates that "Women have equal rights with men to elect and to be elected" (Article 4). The Central Election Committee pointed out in its instructions on grassroots election work: "The nomination of representatives should take into account the broad popular representation of the People's Congress, that is, attention should be paid to ensuring that all classes and nationalities have a number of representatives in the People's Congress commensurate with their status, and special attention should be paid to the number of women representatives." Vice Premier Deng Xiaoping also pointed out in his explanation of the draft "Electoral Law of the National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China and Local People's Congresses at All Levels":
    "...It must be emphasized that although the draft does not need to specifically stipulate the number of women representatives, attention must be paid to electing an appropriate number of women representatives in the election of representatives to the People's Congresses at all levels. It is inconceivable that a People's Congress without an appropriate number of women representatives would have broad representation."
    The Central People's Government attaches such importance to guaranteeing women's right to vote and to be elected because: First, Chinese women have bravely and actively participated in the revolutionary struggle in the past, and will continue to actively participate in the country's economic, political, and cultural and educational construction in the future. They have been, and will inevitably continue to be, a tremendous force. Realizing equality between men and women in this general election and mobilizing the broad masses of women to participate in the general election will further unleash the immeasurable potential power of women and enhance the enthusiasm and creativity of women in national construction. Second, women account for half of the total population, and it is necessary to fully mobilize the vast majority of women voters to participate in the general election movement in order to ensure the breadth and mass character of the general election movement and to elect people's representatives and people's governments that are unanimously supported by all male and female voters. If the mobilization of women voters is ignored, it cannot be a truly nationwide general election. Third, if each level of the People's Congress contains a certain number of women representatives, it will facilitate the establishment of a closer relationship between the state power and the broad masses of women, facilitate state organs to regularly pay attention to the opinions and demands of women, and consider various measures related to women's liberation at any time, thereby more widely tapping the potential power of women to benefit the country's construction.
    Therefore, educating and organizing female voters to fully and correctly exercise their right to vote and to be elected in the general election movement is one of the important keys to doing a good job in the general election movement. We must widely publicize the important significance of women having equal rights with men to vote and to be elected to all the people, especially to the women of the whole country, and encourage women to strive to realize this with practical actions. Educate the people to value and protect this sacred right of women.
    II. Some people say: Our country is raising the political status of women and trying its best to support women to advance together with men. This is certainly the country's good intention, but women are generally not as good as men. Others say: Women are good at managing household affairs, but not at managing state affairs. Even if they are elected, they will fall down and be useless. Still others say: It is okay for women to do women's federation work, but it is not okay to be township chiefs or district chiefs and lead overall work; how can women lead men? These kinds of statements can be heard everywhere. Men discuss this way, women also discuss this way, and even many cadres discuss this way. But facts prove that these statements are completely wrong.
    When the New China's people's democratic power had not yet been established, when workers and peasants had not yet become masters of the country, many people, including some with good intentions, once thought: "You poor fellows are illiterate and have no learning, how can you manage state affairs?" But everyone knows that, in fact, workers and peasants, under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, and united with all democratic classes, have managed the country very well. Workers and peasants have already used their practical actions to prove that these views are wrong.
    Looking solely at working women, many of those who used to work, do odd jobs, sew, sit by the stove, take care of children, herd cattle and sheep, suffer from landlords' oppression, and suffer from feudal foremen's abuse, have now become labor heroes and model workers. There are also many outstanding women who have become people's representatives, government committee members, street chiefs, township chiefs, district chiefs, mayors, county chiefs, government committee members, etc. Many of them have grown up through the disasters of the old society. During the War of Resistance Against Japan and the War of Liberation, and after the victory of the War of Liberation, in various practical movements, the broad masses of Chinese women have received great training, and their political enthusiasm and degree of awareness have greatly improved. This has greatly changed the face of Chinese women. Many of them have been elected to urban and rural grassroots representative conferences, people's representative conferences at all levels, people's government committees... as representatives and committee members, participating in the management of state affairs. According to statistics, in 1952, women representatives accounted for an average of 15 percent of the total number of representatives in people's representative conferences at the county level nationwide. In the North China region alone, there is one female vice-chairman of the provincial government, one female commissioner, 44 female county chiefs and deputy county chiefs, and 65 female district chiefs and deputy district chiefs. Since the founding of New China, the number of women in government agencies at all levels has greatly increased. They have been tempered by democratic life and have played a significant role in the construction of state power. Facts have proven that Chinese women have become an extremely powerful pillar of state power.
    Because many women in government agencies have been tempered in struggle, they can more deeply understand the emotions and demands of workers, peasants, and especially women. In their work, they can care about the interests of the masses, help the masses solve difficulties, and constantly learn and improve their ability to handle affairs in their work, thereby establishing prestige among the masses, and some are even re-elected. Many women feel from them that the political status of women has indeed been raised. Many old women, young women, and husbands use their experiences to educate their children, wives, and sisters.
    Lenin said: "What we need is for working women to be equal to men not only in law but also in fact. It is necessary to have more working women participate in the management of public affairs and the management of the state." He also said: "Only in this way can women learn quickly and catch up with men." (See Lenin's Collected Works, Volume 25) This truth has been fully realized in the Soviet Union. There is no doubt that it will also be gradually realized in China.
    The above facts fully prove that women can not only manage household affairs, but also manage state affairs; women can not only do women's federation work, but also do leadership work in government construction. We must criticize all kinds of feudal remnant thoughts that despise women in order to fully guarantee the realization of equal rights to vote and to be elected for men and women in the general election movement.
    III. In the past, wherever the Party, the government, and the Democratic Women's Federation paid attention to educating and organizing women to participate in democratic government construction, women actively took action, participated in the election work and the leadership work of government agencies, and made many achievements. However, because the leaders in many places still do not have a sufficient understanding of the political significance of mobilizing women to participate in democratic government construction, and because they underestimate the various difficulties and obstacles in women's participation in government work caused by thousands of years of history in Chinese society, and at the same time, because of the lack of regular education and help from the leadership in the process of women's participation in government work, women's participation in government work has developed very unevenly, and many women in many areas are not interested in participating in government construction. In order to mobilize women to actively participate in the general election, it is necessary to carry out a great propaganda and mobilization work. How to carry out propaganda? We only put forward the following suggestions:
    First, women should be made aware of the important significance of the election movement and its close relationship with women themselves. In order to make this kind of propaganda effective, it should first be explained, based on the main tasks of the local street, town, and township-level government in leading production, etc., the relationship between the grassroots government and the broad masses of people, especially women. For example, those things that have been done successfully and are therefore beneficial to all the people, including women; those things that have been done poorly and therefore damage the interests of the people, including women; and those things in which state government workers have neglected women's rights and do not care about women's hardships, causing women's rights to be seriously harmed. In this way, women can realize the important significance of democratic government construction, realize that loving the country must start from loving the grassroots government, and that protecting the grassroots government must value the current general election work and actively participate in the general election movement. It should be explained that women must not only seek equal status with men in labor production and economic status, but also strive to participate in the general election movement, jointly participate in government with men, manage state affairs, and seek true equality with men in political status from practical actions.
    Second, it is necessary to carry out propaganda based on the specific experience of local women participating in democratic government construction, through real people and real events, and point out specific ways and methods for women to participate in government work. Take the good specific experiences and exemplary figures of women participating in government to grassroots women's representative conferences and women's mass meetings for extensive publicity and organization of discussions to increase the interest and enthusiasm of all women and strengthen women's confidence and courage. In addition to this, attention should also be paid to carrying out propaganda about women's participation in the general election in general mass gatherings, explaining the actual role of women in production and construction and government construction in the region, breaking down men's incorrect idea that women cannot handle state affairs, and making ideological preparations for nominating female representative candidates among men and women.
    Third, call on women to cherish their right to vote. Women should understand who has the right to vote and to be elected, and who does not have the right to vote and to be elected. Call on women to care about voter registration work and actively participate in discussions about voter lists. Secondly, call on women to participate in the nomination of representative candidates seriously and carefully, actively participate in discussions about candidates, and elect those outstanding elements who are truly supported by the masses to the state power organs. Women should be told that when considering election objects, they must proceed from the interests of all the people and all women in the whole village, the whole township, and the entire region, seriously and cautiously raise their hands to vote, and should never give up their right to vote, or echo others, or be emotional, and elect whoever they have good feelings for, or elect whoever they are afraid of, or elect whoever they do not like, etc. These practices are all wrong.
    All women should give the greatest concern to the nomination of female representative candidates, because while male representatives can certainly represent women, women understand women's demands and interests better in comparison. Therefore, in addition to paying attention to the entire list of representative candidates, female voters should pay special attention to the nomination and election of female candidates. To this end, it is first necessary to fully deliberate within grassroots women's representative conferences and women's federation organizations, pay attention to selecting and cultivating female representative candidates who can represent and safeguard the interests of all the people and women, and do a good job of preparation, and then widely publicize it among the entire masses to ensure that a certain number of women are elected among all voters. Of course, this is by no means to say that male representative candidates should be excluded, but should proceed from comprehensive representation, conduct a fair comparison of male and female candidates, and finally make the male and female voters become fair appraisers.
    When publicizing and educating all female voters to carry out election work, it is necessary to appropriately combine it with the spirit of anti-bureaucratism, anti-commandism, and anti-violation of laws and discipline. Clean out bad elements, lawbreakers, and those who have committed serious mistakes and have aroused public outrage from government agencies. To this end, it is necessary to publicize and mobilize women to boldly expose the bad deeds of those bad elements who seriously harm the interests of the masses and the interests of women in order to remove bad elements and improve government work. However, it must be explained that for those cadres who have made general shortcomings and mistakes in their work, regardless of whether they are male or female, the policy of criticism and education with the aim of helping people should be adhered to, and they should be helped from the positive side to improve their ideology and work methods and improve their understanding, and they should not be equated with bad elements. It is wrong to adopt a purely passive attitude of criticism towards the shortcomings and mistakes of cadres. We must believe that the vast majority of cadres are good, are actively working hard and enduring hardships, and their shortcomings can be corrected after education. Bad elements account for only a very small number of the entire cadres, so cleaning out bad elements is by no means "moving stones" or "major reshuffling," and the idea of wanting a "major reshuffling" before the general election must also be corrected.
    Fourth, for women who have already participated in government work, it is necessary to help them summarize their experiences and lessons in participating in government work, help them solve the practical difficulties they encounter in their daily work, strengthen their confidence in work, remove ideological obstacles, and pay attention to commending model figures and model deeds among those women who have participated in government, constantly encourage and help them strengthen their sense of responsibility for the people's cause, strive to improve their political level, cultural level, and ability to handle affairs, closely connect with the masses, maintain a down-to-earth and simple work style, and better learn economic construction knowledge, so that government work can better serve production.
    Fifth, in order to realize the principle of "women have equal rights with men to vote and to be elected" stipulated in the Electoral Law and realize equal rights for men and women in political status, women's federations at all levels need to pay attention to carrying out extensive and in-depth propaganda and mobilization work in the general election and strive to mobilize the largest number of female voters to enthusiastically participate in the general election movement. The more thorough and better the propaganda and mobilization work of women's federations at all levels among women, the more guaranteed the election of female representative candidates will be. At the same time, we cannot ignore the important significance of publicizing women's participation in the general election to the broad masses of people and widely publicizing and introducing female representative candidates, and criticizing the various feudal thoughts that despise women's participation in government. Conversely, if we do not pay great attention to doing a good job of propaganda and mobilization work, then the number and proportion of women among the representatives will lack practical guarantee. Secondly, in order to concentrate our efforts on doing a good job in the general election, in mobilizing women, we must take into account the current production activities of the masses, implement the Central Committee's instructions on taking production as the overriding central task, and combine the general election work with production. Therefore, we should not add many work tasks to them that they cannot manage to avoid increasing the burden on the masses, dispersing the strength of the cadres, and affecting the completion of the main tasks.

    动员妇女群众积极参加普选运动
    中华全国民主妇女联合会宣传教育部副部长  李屺阳
    一中国人民历史上从来没有过的普选运动即将开始了。中央人民政府公布的选举法中明确地规定了“妇女有与男子同等的选举权和被选举权”（第四条）。中央选举委员会在关于基层选举工作的指示中指出：“代表候选人的提名，应注意到人民代表大会的广泛的人民代表性，即应注意到各阶层各民族都在人民代表大会中有与其地位相当的代表名额，尤其要注意到妇女的代表名额。”邓小平副总理在关于“中华人民共和国全国人民代表大会及地方各级人民代表大会选举法”草案的说明中也指出：
    “……必须着重指出，草案中虽无须专门规定妇女代表的名额，但在各级人民代表大会代表的选举中，必须注意选出适当数目的妇女代表。不能设想，没有适当数目的妇女代表的人民代表大会，会具有广泛的代表性。”
    中央人民政府这样重视保障妇女的选举权和被选举权，这是因为：第一，我们中国妇女过去曾英勇地积极地参加了革命的斗争，今后还要积极地参加国家的经济、政治和文化教育的建设事业，她们曾经是而且将来也必然还是一支巨大的力量。在这次普选中实现男女平等，动员广大妇女来参加普选，就能更进一步地发挥妇女的无可限量的潜在力量，提高妇女群众在国家建设中的积极性和创造性。第二，妇女占全体人民的一半，必须充分地动员最大多数的妇女选民参加普选运动，才能保证普选运动的广泛性和群众性，才能选出为全体男女选民所一致拥护的人民代表和人民政府；如果忽视动员妇女选民，就不能成为真正全民的普选。第三，如果各级人民代表大会中都包含一定数量的妇女代表，就便利于国家政权与广大妇女群众之间建立更加密切的联系，便利于国家机关经常注意妇女的意见和要求，随时考虑有关妇女解放的各种措施，从而更加广泛地发掘妇女群众的潜在力量，以利于国家建设的进行。
    正因为这样，在普选运动中教育和组织女选民充分地正确地运用选举权和被选举权，就是做好普选运动的重要关键之一。我们必须将妇女有与男子同等的选举权与被选举权的重要意义，向全体人民群众，特别是向全国妇女群众广泛宣传，鼓舞妇女群众以实际行动去努力实现。教育人民群众重视和保障妇女的这种神圣权利。
    二有人说：我们的国家提高妇女的政治地位，尽力扶植妇女与男子共同前进，这固然是国家的好心肠，但是，妇女总不如男子。还有人说：妇女管家事能行，管国事不行，就是选上也得掉下来，不顶事。也有人说：妇女做妇联会工作还行，当乡长、区长，领导全面工作就不行；那有妇女领导男人的？这种种说法，是到处都可以听得到的。男人这样议论，女人也这样议论，甚至不少干部也这样议论。可是事实证明，这些说法都是完全不对的。
    当新中国人民民主政权还没有建立的时候，当工人农民还没有成为国家主人的时候，很多人，甚至包含某些好心肠的人在内，曾经认为：“你们这些穷小子一字不识，毫无学问，还会管理国家大事吗？”但是谁都知道：事实上，工人农民在毛主席和中国共产党的领导下，和全国各民主阶级团结一致把国家管理得很好。工人农民已经用自己的实际行动来证明了这些看法是错误的。
    单从工农劳动妇女方面看，那些过去做工的、打零工的、做针线活的、坐灶门口的、带娃娃的、放牛羊的、受地主欺凌的、受封建把头虐待的，今天已有很多成为劳动英雄和模范人物。也有不少优秀妇女，当了人民代表、政府委员、街长、乡长、区长、市长、县长、政府委员等等。她们之中有很多人是从旧社会的灾难中磨炼成长起来的。在抗日战争和解放战争时期，在解放战争胜利之后，在各种实际运动中，中国广大妇女都得到了很大的锻炼，她们的政治热情和觉悟程度有了极大的提高。这就使中国妇女的面貌有了极大的改变。她们之中很多人被选入城乡基层代表会、各界人民代表会、人民政府委员会……当了代表，当了委员，参加了管理国家的事业。据统计，一九五二年全国县各界人民代表会议中的女代表平均已占到总数的百分之十五。仅就华北区而论，有女省政府副主席一人，女专员一人，女正副县长四十四人，女正副区长六十五人。自新中国成立以来，各级政权机构中妇女的数量均有很大增加。她们受到了民主生活的锻炼，在国家政权建设工作中起了很大作用。事实证明，中国妇女已经成为国家政权的极其有力的支柱。
    由于很多政权机构中的妇女是从斗争中锻炼出来的，因而她们能够比较深刻地体会到工农劳动人民，特别是妇女群众的情绪和要求。她们在工作中，能够关心群众利益，帮助群众解决困难，并在工作中不断学习，提高自己的办事能力，因而在群众中树立了威信，有的还连选连任。许多妇女从她们身上感到妇女的政治地位确实是提高了。很多老太婆、青年妇女、作丈夫的都以她们的事实教育自己的子女、妻子和姐妹。
    列宁说：“我们所需要的是劳动妇女不仅在法律上而且在事实上与男子平等。一定要让劳动妇女更多地参加管理公共事业和管理国家的工作。”还说：“这样妇女才能迅速学习，迎头赶上男子。”（见列宁全集，第二十五卷）这一条真理已在苏联完全实现了。毫无疑问，它将同样在中国逐步实现。
    以上事实，完全证明了妇女不但能管家事，而且也能管国事；妇女不但能做妇联会的工作，也会做政权建设的领导工作。我们必须批驳轻视妇女的种种封建残余思想，以便充分地保证在普选运动中确实实现男女平等的选举权与被选举权。
    三过去，凡是党、政府和民主妇联注意教育和组织妇女参加民主建政的地方，妇女都积极地行动起来，参加了选举工作和政权机关的领导工作，并作出了不少成绩。但是由于很多地方的领导者，对发动妇女参加民主建政工作的政治意义还认识不足，又由于对中国社会几千年来历史上造成妇女参加政权工作中的种种困难和障碍估计不足，同时，在妇女参加政权工作的过程中，又由于领导上经常地教育和帮助不够，因而妇女参加政权工作还发展得极不平衡，不少地区的不少妇女，对参加政权建设还不感兴趣。为了动员妇女群众积极参加普选，必须进行巨大的宣传鼓动工作。怎样进行宣传呢？我们仅提出以下意见：
    第一，应该使妇女群众认识选举运动的重要意义以及这一运动与妇女的切身关系。为使这种宣传能够有效，首先应该从根据当地街镇、乡区基层政权领导生产等几项主要工作中说明基层政权与广大人民，特别是与妇女的关系。比如那些事情办得有成绩，因而对全体人民有利，对妇女也有利；那些事情办坏了，因而损害了人民利益，也损害了妇女利益；又有那些事情由于国家政权工作人员忽视了妇女的权利，不关心妇女疾苦，使妇女权利受到了严重的损害。这样就可以使妇女认识到民主建政的重要意义，认识爱国家必须从爱护基层政权做起，爱护基层政权必须重视现在的普选工作，积极参加普选运动。应该说明妇女不仅要在劳动生产和经济地位上与男子求得平等地位，还必须努力参加普选运动，与男子共同参加政权，管理国家大事，从实际行动中求得与男子在政治地位上的真正平等。
    第二，要根据当地妇女参加民主建政的具体经验，通过真人真事进行宣传，给妇女指出参加政权工作的具体道路和办法。把妇女参政的好的具体经验和人物事例，拿到基层妇女代表会和妇女群众大会上去，广泛宣传，组织讨论，以提高全体妇女的兴趣和热情，坚定妇女的信心和勇气。除此之外，并应注意在一般群众集会上，也进行有关妇女应参加普选的宣传，说明本地区妇女在生产建设和政权建设中的实际作用，打破男子不相信妇女能办国家大事的不正确思想，并为在男女群众中提出女代表候选人做好思想准备工作。
    第三，要号召妇女珍贵自己的选举权利。要妇女懂得那些人有选举权和被选举权，那些人没有选举权和被选举权。要号召妇女关心选民登记工作，并积极参加选民名单的讨论会议。其次还要号召妇女认真而慎重地参加代表候选人的提名，积极参加对候选人的讨论会议，把那些真正为群众所拥护的优秀分子选举到国家政权机关中来。要告诉妇女群众，在她们考虑选举对象时，必须从全村、全乡、整个地区的全体人民和全体妇女利益出发，严肃地慎重地举手投票，绝不应该放弃自己的选举权利，或随声附和，或感情用事，和谁感情好就选谁，或者害怕谁就选谁，和谁不好就选谁等等，这些作法都是不对的。
    对女代表候选人的提出，全体妇女要予以最大的关心，因为男代表固然可以代表妇女，但比较起来，妇女更懂得妇女的要求和利益，因而女选民除注视整个代表的候选名单之外，特别要注意女候选人的提名和当选。为此，首先须在基层妇女代表会和妇联组织中充分酝酿，注意选择和培养能代表与维护全体人民利益和妇女利益的女代表候选人，做好准备工作，然后在全体群众中广泛宣传，以保证在全体选民中有一定数量的妇女当选。当然这绝不是说，应该排挤男代表候选人，而应从全面的代表性出发，对男女候选人进行公正的评比，最后使男女选民群众成为公正的鉴定人。
    宣传教育全体妇女选民在进行选举工作时，要适当结合反官僚主义、反命令主义、反违法乱纪的精神。把坏分子、违法乱纪分子及犯严重错误而已引起群众公愤的分子从政权机构中清洗出去。为此，必须宣传动员妇女大胆揭发那些严重危害群众利益、危害妇女利益的坏分子的坏事迹，以便去掉坏分子，改善政权工作，但是必须说明，对于那些在工作中犯了一般性的缺点和错误的干部，不分男女，均应坚持与人为善的批评教育的方针，从积极方面帮助他们改进思想作风和工作方法，提高他们的认识，而不应把他们与坏分子同等看待。对于干部的缺点和错误采取单纯消极指责的态度是不对的。我们要相信绝大多数干部都是好的，是积极工作吃苦耐劳的，他们的缺点经过教育之后也是可以改正的。坏分子在整个干部中只占极少数，因之清洗坏分子，绝不是“搬石头”、“大换班”，因而那种在普选前想“大换班”的思想也是必须纠正的。
    第四，对于已经参加政权工作的妇女，要帮助她们总结在参政工作中的经验教训，帮助她们解决在日常工作中遇到的实际困难，加强工作信心，除去思想障碍，并注意表扬那些已参政的妇女中的模范人物和模范事迹，经常地鼓励和帮助她们加强对人民事业的负责精神，努力提高自己的政治水平、文化水平和办事能力，密切与群众的联系，保持踏实朴素的工作作风，更好地学习经济建设知识，使政权工作更好地为生产服务。
    第五，各级民主妇联为了实现选举法规定的“妇女有与男子同等的选举权与被选举权”的原则，实现男女在政治地位上的平等权利，需要注意在普选中进行广泛而深入的宣传鼓动工作，争取把最大多数的妇女选民动员起来，热烈地参加普选运动。各级妇联组织在妇女群众中的宣传鼓动工作做得越深入、越好，对女代表候选人的当选就越有保证。同时，我们也不能忽视向广大人民群众宣传妇女参加普选的重要意义和广泛宣传介绍女代表候选人，批判那种轻视妇女参加政权的各种封建思想。反过来，我们如果不能以大力注意认真做好宣传鼓动工作，那末，代表妇女中的名额和妇女比例，将会缺少实际保证。其次，为了集中力量做好普选工作，在动员妇女中，我们必须照顾到当前群众的生产活动，执行中央关于以生产为压倒一切的中心工作的指示，结合生产来进行普选工作，因而不应在普选中同时附加许多使他们力所不及的工作任务，以免增加群众负担，分散干部力量，影响主要工作的完成。（新华社）
