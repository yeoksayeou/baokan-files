    Learn to Manage Enterprises with Scientific Methods
    To continuously improve and strengthen the management of enterprises is a huge task in economic work. In the past, we summarized and promoted the management experience of the Factory 53, especially its experience in deeply mobilizing the masses and combining political work with production. This is an important aspect of enterprise management. However, in addition to this, we also need to learn another subject, which is to learn the experience of planned management, that is, to learn to manage enterprises with scientific methods. In this regard, Anshan Iron and Steel Company and other factories in the Northeast (including Factory 53) have made some achievements. We should value their experience and learn from and promote their experience.
    Planned management is the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and a science for effectively managing modern socialist industries. To manage modern industrial and mining enterprises well, we must learn and master this science. The requirements of planned management are multifaceted, but the most important is to combine workers' operations with scientific management, which is centrally reflected in a unified plan to organize rhythmic production. Because modern industry is a large-scale, continuous, and complex production, any enterprise needs to cooperate closely with other enterprises and precisely calculate and balance various complex factors within the enterprise, such as the supply of raw materials, the utilization of equipment capacity, the arrangement of machine maintenance, and the organization of labor. In this complex situation, without meticulous plans and scientific management methods, production chaos and disconnection will inevitably occur. In the past, due to the lack of planned management in many factories and mines, production was extremely uneven. Although the state's production plan was exceeded year after year, some backward factories failed to complete their tasks; although the output of industrial products increased year after year, the plan for some major products was not completed; although the output of some factories and mines completed the plan, the variety, quality, and cost accounting failed to complete the plan. At the same time, the uneven production also caused insufficient start-up, overtime work, and increased defective products, which brought great losses to our production. This phenomenon must be overcome quickly.
    At present, the actual situation of enterprise management in our country is still far from the requirements of planned management, which is not surprising. First, most of our existing state-owned enterprises are old enterprises taken over from the enemy and puppet regimes, and their original production organization and management methods were chaotic and backward. Secondly, many of our enterprise management cadres are just beginning to learn to manage enterprises, and their experience is still very lacking. Therefore, we must start from scratch. However, as long as we study the Soviet experience hard and earnestly improve enterprise management, our progress will certainly be rapid. The medium-sized rolling mill of Anshan Iron and Steel Company is one such example. Since this factory studied the Soviet planned management work and implemented operation plans and dispatching work, it quickly reversed the uneven state of production, which was loose at first and then tight. In the first quarter of this year, the equilibrium rate of the factory reached 100 percent for nine weeks, and more than 90 percent for the remaining three weeks. Output, quality, and equipment utilization rate increased, and accidents decreased. Because production was planned, ensuring normal operations, the factory's leading cadres were able to get rid of the state of busyness, take time to study their business, and grasp the main links in production, which also created conditions for overcoming bureaucratic work style. At the same time, since the production activities of each day and each hour have specific regulations, the production tasks and goals of the workers are very clear, and the operation has a direction, they can actively arrange their own work, thereby promoting a series of technical improvements, continuously improving production quotas, and greatly boosting production enthusiasm. Undoubtedly, after such production exercises, the discipline and organization of the working class will be further strengthened and consolidated, and their ability to manage production and their conscious labor spirit will be cultivated. On this basis, the policy of relying on the working class to improve production can be given richer content and further implemented.
    The experience of Anshan Iron and Steel and other enterprises proves that the implementation of planned management should start with the formulation of operation plans and the establishment of dispatching work. The operation plan is the concretization of the production activities of each workshop, section, group, and process and their interconnections, and finally expressed in the form of production instruction charts, which are clear at a glance. Dispatching work is to supervise the implementation of the operation plan, grasp new imbalances in production, and overcome these imbalances. These are two parallel tasks. In order to do a good job in operation planning and dispatching, it is necessary to conduct full deliberations among employees, so that everyone understands the importance and role of planned management, overcomes various ideological obstacles, and guarantees the realization of the plan with conscious labor. It is necessary to closely integrate workers and technicians, give full play to the potential of the enterprise, formulate operation plans based on advanced production plans and quotas, and adjust and modify them at any time according to new achievements in production. It is necessary to make all calculations and statistics simple and clear, practical, and easy for workers to remember and master. It is necessary to establish dedicated agencies and designate dedicated personnel, strictly implement the responsibility system, and drive and promote other aspects of the responsibility system in the production process. In addition, there is a very important experience, that is, to resolutely learn from the Soviet Union and implement the suggestions of Soviet experts. The planned management work of Anshan Iron and Steel Company was established with the advice and enthusiastic help of Soviet experts. From the experience of Anshan Iron and Steel Company, we can see how the combination of the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and the actual production of China quickly changed the face of our old enterprises. At the same time, the experience of Anshan Iron and Steel Company once again proves the unparalleled superiority of socialist enterprises in developing productive forces.
    However, this does not mean that our cadres fully understand the importance of learning planned management—managing modern enterprises with scientific methods. It should be pointed out that even today, many cadres still have a vague understanding of how to manage enterprises. Therefore, although they have done a lot of work, they have not effectively improved the management level of enterprises. For example, many factories and mines have discussed production plans every year, launched labor competitions, and mobilized employees to put forward rationalization proposals. The masses have been mobilized vigorously, and the quantity and quality of products have also been improved. However, due to the lack of scientific management, these achievements are often not consolidated, and the creative labor of the masses is not well organized. Therefore, there is a phenomenon of "advanced planning, active masses, and backward management" and "thousands of new records, but the state plan cannot be completed." There are also some enterprises that are separated from the center of production, organizing workers to participate in political activities, or launching struggles against bureaucracy, which seriously affects production. The reasons for the above situations are, on the one hand, that the leading cadres of these enterprises have not deeply studied production and cannot grasp the basic links in production management, and on the other hand, that many enterprise management cadres have not completely abandoned the handicraft methods of rural work. They mistakenly believe that as long as a mass movement is launched, all production problems can be solved. They do not understand that mass movements can only truly improve production when combined with strengthening production organization and improving production management. The resolution of the Ninth Congress of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks) in 1920 once wrote: "...without scientific production organization, the most extensive labor obligation system and the highest labor heroism of the working class cannot guarantee the construction of a strong socialist economy, and cannot give the country the possibility of getting rid of the clutches of poverty." This passage should arouse our high attention.
    In order to smoothly establish planned management, we must also oppose various excuses and incorrect ideas. For example, some people think that they must wait for other factories or the previous process of the same enterprise to create sufficient conditions for themselves before they can implement planned management. Some people think that basic records and quota management have not been done well, production items are constantly changing, equipment is old, and output quality fluctuates greatly, so there is no basis for formulating operation plans. Some people think that the operation plan cannot be consistent with the actual production situation and needs to be adjusted and modified frequently, and in the past, production was carried out without a plan, so there is no need to formulate a plan. These views are obviously wrong. The production process is certainly affected by many external and internal conditions, but as long as we give play to subjective initiative, we can create conditions for production and change conditions. If everyone sits and waits for others to prepare conditions for themselves, the result will inevitably be nothing. Secondly, the inconsistency between the operation plan and the actual situation and the changes in the operation plan are also inevitable. This also reflects the difference that often exists between our understanding and objective circumstances. Only by facing this difference and studying its causes can we gain experience and improve ourselves. Conversely, if the operation plan is unchanged, it will lose its guiding significance, and there will be no need for leadership. Of course, due to the incompleteness of certain conditions, it may not be done well at the beginning of implementing planned management. This can only be gradually improved in practice and gradually made perfect. The planned management work of some factories and mines in the Northeast has been gradually established through such a process. Of course, we should also prevent practices such as operation plans and instruction charts that are merely formalistic, impractical, unable to guide production, or restricted by charts, limiting the development of production.
    At present, some state-owned enterprises are discussing the national plan, and some have already finished the discussion. In order to consolidate the achievements of discussing and formulating the plan, we must not hesitate to further establish and improve the planned management work on this basis. If we can do this work well, the realization of the 1953 national plan can be strongly guaranteed, and our enterprise management level and production level will certainly be greatly improved.

    学会用科学方法管理企业
    不断地改进和加强企业的管理工作，是经济工作中的一项巨大的任务。过去，我们曾经总结和推广了五三工厂的管理经验，特别是它深入发动群众、政治工作和生产相结合的经验，这是企业管理工作的一个重要方面。但是，除此而外，我们还需要学习另外一个课题，就是要学习计划管理的经验，也就是要学会用科学的方法来管理企业。在这一方面，鞍山钢铁公司和东北其它一些工厂（包括五三工厂在内），已经作出了一些成绩。我们应该重视他们的经验，学习和推广他们的经验。
    计划管理是苏联的先进经验，是最有效地管理现代化的社会主义性质的工业的一种科学。我们要管好现代的工矿企业，就必须学习和掌握这门科学。计划管理的要求是多方面的，但最主要的就是把工人的操作和科学管理相结合，集中表现到统一的计划中去，组织有节奏的生产。因为现代工业是大规模的、连续性的、复杂的生产，任何一个企业要进行正常的作业，既要密切地和其它企业互相配合，又要精密地计算和平衡企业内部的各种复杂因素，例如原材料的供应、设备能力的运用、机器检修的安排、劳动力量的组织等等。在这种复杂的情况中，如果没有周密的计划和科学的管理方法，就将不可避免地引起生产的混乱和脱节现象。过去，由于很多厂矿缺乏计划管理，生产极不均衡，国家的生产计划虽然年年超过，某些落后的工厂却完不成任务；工业品产量虽然年年增加，某些主要产品却没有完成计划；某些厂矿的产量虽然完成了计划，但品种、质量和成本财务却完不成计划。同时，由于生产的不均衡，也就造成开工不足、加班赶工、废品增加的现象，给我们的生产带来了很大的损失。这种现象，是必须迅速克服的。
    目前我国企业管理工作的实际情况，距离计划管理工作的要求还很远，这是不足奇怪的。首先是因为我们现有的国营企业大多是从敌伪手中接收的旧企业，其原有的生产组织和管理方法是混乱和落后的。其次是因为我们的很多企业管理干部，刚刚学习管理企业，经验还十分缺乏。因此我们必须从头学起，从头作起。但是只要我们努力学习苏联经验，认真地改进企业管理，我们的进步也一定是很快的。鞍山钢铁公司中型轧钢厂就是这样的例子之一。这个工厂学习苏联计划管理工作，试行作业计划和调度工作以来，很快地就扭转了生产上先松后紧的不均衡状态。今年第一季度，该厂有九个星期的均衡率达到百分之百，其余三个星期也达到百分之九十以上，产量、质量和设备运用率提高了，事故减少了。由于生产有了计划，保证了正常的作业，工厂的领导干部也就得以摆脱忙乱的状态，抽出时间钻研业务，掌握生产中的主要环节，这也为克服官僚主义作风创造了条件。同时，由于每天每小时的生产活动，都有了具体规定，工人们的生产任务和奋斗目标十分明确，操作有了方向，也就能够主动地安排自己的工作，从而推动了一系列的技术改进，不断地提高了生产定额，大大鼓舞了生产热情。无疑地，经过这样的生产的锻炼，将更加加强和巩固工人阶级的纪律性和组织性，培养他们管理生产的才能和自觉的劳动精神。在这个基础上，依靠工人阶级搞好生产的方针，才能得到更加丰富的内容，并进一步地求得贯彻。
    鞍钢及其它企业的经验，证明了实行计划管理首先应从编制作业计划和建立调度工作着手。作业计划就是各车间、各工段、各小组和各工序的生产活动及其相互联系的具体化，最后并以生产指示图表表示出来，一目了然。而调度工作则是为了监督作业计划的执行，掌握生产中新的不平衡情况并克服这些不平衡状态，这是同时并行的两项工作。为了作好作业计划和调度工作，就必须在职工中进行充分的酝酿，使大家明白计划管理的重要意义和作用，克服各种思想障碍，并用自觉的劳动来保证计划的实现。必须使工人和技术人员紧密结合，充分发挥企业的潜力，根据先进的生产计划和定额编制作业计划，并随时根据生产中的新的成就加以调整和修改。必须使一切计算和统计工作简单明了，切合实际，便于工人记忆和掌握。必须要建立专责的机构和指定专责的人员，严格实行负责制，并在生产过程中带动和推行其它方面的责任制度。除此以外，还有一项极为重要的经验，这就是坚决学习苏联，贯彻苏联专家的建议。鞍山钢铁公司的计划管理工作，是在苏联专家的建议和热情的帮助下建立起来的。从鞍山钢铁公司的经验中，可以看到苏联的先进经验和中国生产的实际相结合以后，如何迅速地改变了我国旧企业的面貌。同时，鞍山钢铁公司的经验，又一次证明了社会主义性质的企业在发挥生产力方面的无比的优越性。
    但是，这并不是说我们的干部已充分地了解了学习计划管理——用科学的办法来管理现代企业的重要意义。应当指出，直到今天还有很多干部对如何管理企业是认识不清的，因此他们虽然作了很多工作，却没有有效地改进企业的管理水平。例如很多厂矿，虽然每年也讨论了生产计划，展开了劳动竞赛，发动职工提出了合理化建议，群众是轰轰烈烈地发动起来了，产品的数量与质量也有所提高；但是由于缺乏科学的管理，这些成绩往往不能巩固，群众的创造性劳动也没有很好地组织起来。因此就出现了“计划先进、群众积极、管理落后”，和
    “新纪录千千万，国家计划完不成”的现象。还有
    一些企业，脱离生产中心，组织工人参加政治活动，或者抛开生产进行反官僚主义斗争，结果严重地影响了生产。产生以上情况的原因，一方面是由于这些企业的领导干部还没有深入钻研生产，抓不住生产管理中的基本环节，另一面是因为很多企业管理干部还没有完全摆脱农村工作的手工业方式，他们错误地认为只要掀起一个群众运动，就可以解决一切生产问题。他们不了解群众运动只有和加强生产组织、改进生产管理相结合，才能真正搞好生产。一九二○年俄共第九次代表大会的决议中曾经写道：“…没有科学的生产组织，最广泛的劳动义务制度与工人阶级最高度的劳动英雄主义，都不能保证建设强大的社会主义经济，并且也不能给国家以摆脱贫困魔爪的可能”。这一段话，应该引起我们高度的注意。
    为了顺利地建立计划管理，还必须反对各种藉口和不正确的思想。例如有人认为必须等待其它工厂或同一企业的上一个工序给自己创造了充分的条件以后，自己才能实行计划管理。有人认为原始记录和定额管理尚未作好、生产项目经常变动、设备陈旧、产量质量波动很大，编制作业计划没有根据。有人认为作业计划不可能和实际生产情况一致，经常要调整修改，而过去没有计划也一样进行了生产，因此不必制定计划。这些看法显然都是错误的。生产的过程固然要受很多外在的和内部的条件影响，但是只要我们发挥了主观的能动性，就可以为生产创造条件，改变条件，如果大家都坐待别人给自己准备好条件，其结果必然会一事无成。其次，作业计划和实际情况的不一致和作业计划的变动，也是必然的。这也正反映了我们的认识和客观情况之间常常存在的差别，只有正视这种差别，研究它的原因，也才能取得经验，提高自己。反之，如果作业计划是不变的，它就会失去指导意义，也就用不着领导了。当然，由于某些条件的不完备，在实行计划管理之初，可能作得很不好，这也只有在实践中逐步加以改进，逐步使之趋于完善。东北若干厂矿的计划管理工作，也正是经过这样的历程而逐步建立起来的。当然，我们应该同时防止徒具形式、不切实际、不能指导生产的作业计划和指示图表，或为图表所束缚，限制生产的发展等作法。
    目前，各国营企业有的正在讨论国家计划，有的已经讨论结束，为了巩固讨论和制定计划的成绩，必须毫不犹豫地在这基础上进一步建立和健全计划管理工作。如果我们能作好这项工作，一九五三年国家计划的实现就能得到坚强的保证，我们企业管理水平和生产水平也一定会大大提高一步。
