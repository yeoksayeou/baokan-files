Xinhua News Agency, June 17th: Tokyo dispatch: On the 15th, under the assistance of the Yoshida government, the U.S. occupation forces forcibly began live ammunition target practice in Uchinada Village. On this day, the people of Uchinada Village, with the support of the broad Japanese people, launched a fierce struggle.

The people of Uchinada Village, who had been engaged in a long-term struggle, disregarded the intimidation of more than 1,000 armed police sent by the Yoshida government and stayed up all night from the evening of the 14th to the morning of the 15th, persistently staging a sit-in protest at the northern end of the target area. More than 1,000 union members and students who came to support the people of Uchinada Village also held demonstrations around the Uchinada Village target range all day long starting from the morning of the 15th. When the U.S. military began firing shells for target practice at 8:00 a.m., the demonstrators linked arms, and with each shell explosion, they shouted the slogan, "Yankees, go home!" The emotionally charged demonstrators persisted until midnight on the 15th before retreating.

The struggle against the Yoshida government's forced designation of Uchinada Village as a U.S. military firing range continues to gain increasing support from the Japanese working class and people. After the Hokuriku Railway Workers' Union made the decision to refuse to transport military supplies for the U.S. military to the Uchinada firing range, the Central Guidance Department of the Japanese Communist Party immediately sent a telegram encouraging this practical action of the union. The Japan Private Railway Workers' Union Federation and people from all over the country also sent telegrams of support to the Hokuriku Railway Workers' Union. At the closing meeting of the Japan Teachers' Union National Congress on the 14th, it was decided to send 60 representatives to Uchinada Village to support the struggle of the local people. About 50 professors from Kanazawa University also issued a joint statement on the 13th opposing the Yoshida government's forced takeover of Uchinada Village as a U.S. military firing range and submitted the statement to the Yoshida government and the Japanese Diet.

The Japanese Communist Party and the left-wing Socialist Party have decided to request the Diet to discuss the Uchinada Village issue when the Diet reconvenes on the 16th.

Xinhua News Agency, June 17th: Tokyo dispatch: The movement of the Japanese people against U.S. military bases is developing nationwide.

The people of Kujukuri Beach in Chiba Prefecture, who have engaged in a long-term struggle, are strengthening their movement to defend their homeland. A delegation of eleven representatives, headed by Sakuragi Masanaka, the mayor of Toyoumi Town, submitted a request to the Governor of Chiba Prefecture on the 12th demanding the removal of the U.S. military's training grounds on Kujukuri Beach. They pointed out that the U.S. military's exercises have seriously affected local fisheries and agriculture, students cannot attend classes, and U.S. military atrocities occur constantly. The representatives also stated that they would launch a vigorous movement to force the U.S. military to withdraw.

In Fukuoka, the city council recently passed a resolution opposing the U.S. Air Force's use of Hakata Bay for seaplanes, because the U.S. Air Force's use of Hakata Bay has greatly reduced fish production. The city council also decided to submit a written opinion to the relevant authorities.

In Yamagata Prefecture, local people are conducting a signature campaign demanding that the U.S. military remove its training grounds within the prefecture.

In Wakayama Prefecture, the fishermen's representatives of Oshima Village in Muro District and the left-wing Socialist Party member of the Diet, Tanaka Okinoshin, went to Prime Minister Yoshida Shigeru's official residence in Tokyo on the 12th to petition against the U.S. military's plan to establish a radar base in the area.

Meanwhile, the movement against the U.S. military's use of the Mount Asama and Mount Myogi areas for military exercises continues to develop. People in Nagano Prefecture and Gunma Prefecture have held parades and demonstrations opposing the U.S. military's establishment of training grounds within their prefectures. The Japan Teachers' Union National Congress, which closed on the 14th, and the Sixth National Congress of the All-Japan Student Self-Government Association Federation, which closed on the 15th, both passed resolutions opposing the U.S. military's use of Mount Asama as a training ground.

Xinhua News Agency, June 17th: Tokyo dispatch: On May 30th, the people of Tokyo held a Peace and Anti-Fascist Assembly to commemorate the "May 30th Incident." May 30th has become a day that the Japanese people cannot forget. On May 30, 1949, the reactionary Japanese government carried out a bloody suppression of the demonstration by the working masses of Tokyo, brutally murdering transportation worker Hashimoto Kinji; on May 30, 1950, the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries armedly suppressed the Tokyo People's Congress and arrested eight Japanese patriots; on May 30, 1952, the Japanese police brutally suppressed mass gatherings throughout the country, massacring and arresting large numbers of patriotic Japanese people.

This year's "May 30th" commemoration assembly in Tokyo was jointly organized by many labor unions, such as the Tokyo branch of the All-Japan Metal Workers' Union, and people's organizations such as the Japan National Relief Association. More than 2,000 people attended the assembly, including victims and their families of the "May 30th," "Matsukawa," "May Day," and other incidents in which the Yoshida government suppressed and persecuted the Japanese people who demanded peace and democracy, defendants on bail, as well as workers, citizens, and students.

At the meeting, the mother of Sakurai Takahiro, a victim of the "May 30th Incident," Okamoto Mitsuo, a defendant in the "May Day Incident," Nikaido Sonoko, a defendant in the "Matsukawa Incident," and representatives of labor unions such as Tokyo Machinery Manufacturing Co. and Nissan Chemical Industries Co. took the stage to speak. They used the bloody facts of their personal experiences to accuse the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries of the bloody suppression of the Japanese people and called on the Japanese people to unite to oppose fascist rule and defend human rights and peace.

    日本人民展开反对美国军事基地的运动
    东京人民举行和平与反法西斯大会纪念“五·三○事件”
    【新华社十七日讯】东京消息：十五日，美国占领军在吉田政府协助下开始强制在内滩村实弹打靶。这一天，内滩村人民在广大日本人民的支援下展开了激烈的斗争。
    进行了长期斗争的内滩村人民，不顾吉田政府派来的一千多名武装警察的威吓，从十四日晚到十五日晨彻夜不眠，在靶场区北端坚持静坐抗议的斗争。前来支援内滩村人民的一千多名工会会员和学生，从十五日清晨起也终日在内滩村靶场周围举行示威。当早晨八时，美军开始发射炮弹进行打靶演习时，示威者挽着臂膀，每有一颗炮弹爆炸，他们就高呼一声“美国佬滚回去！”的口号。情绪激昂的示威群众，一直坚持到十五日午夜才撤退。
    反对吉田政府强制将内滩村划作美军打靶场的斗争，继续获得日本工人阶级和人民越来越多的声援。在北陆铁道工人工会作出了拒绝为美军运输军用物资往内滩打靶场的决定后，日本共产党中央指导部即致电鼓励该工会的这一实际行动。日本私营铁道工会总联合会和全国各地的人民也纷纷致电声援北陆铁道工人工会。日本教职员工会全国大会在十四日的闭幕会议上决定派六十个代表去内滩村支援当地人民的斗争。金泽大学的约五十个教授也曾在十三日发表联合声明，反对吉田政府强制接收内滩村为美军打靶场，并将声明交给吉田政府和日本国会。
    日本共产党和左派社会党已经决定在国会于十六日复会时，要求国会讨论内滩村问题。
    【新华社十七日讯】东京消息：日本人民反对美国军事基地的运动，正在向全国发展。
    曾经进行长期斗争的千叶县的九十九里滨人民，又在加强他们的保卫乡土运动。以当地丰海镇镇长樱井正中为首的十一名代表，在十二日向千叶县知事（县长）提出了撤除美军在九十九里滨的演习场的要求。他们指出：美军的演习使当地的渔业和农业受到严重影响，学生不能上课，并且不断发生美军的暴行。代表们并表示要发动一个强有力的运动使美军撤退。
    在福冈，市议会最近通过一项反对美国空军水上飞机使用博多湾海面的决议，因为美国空军使用博多湾已使鱼产量大为减少。市议会并决定向有关方面提出意见书。
    在山形县，当地的人民正在进行签名运动，要求美军撤除在县境内的演习场。
    在和歌山县，该县所属牟娄群大岛村的渔民代表和左派社会党议员田中织之进，在十二日到东京吉田茂首相的官邸请愿，表示反对美军在该地建立雷达基地的计划。
    同时，反对美军以浅间山和妙义山一带为军事演习场的运动仍在继续发展中。长野县和群马县的人民都举行了游行示威，反对美军在他们县境设立演习场。十四日闭幕的日本教职员工会全国大会和十五日闭幕的全日本学生自治会总联合会第六届全国大会都曾通过决议，反对美军以浅间山为演习场。
    【新华社十七日讯】东京消息：五月三十日，东京人民举行了和平与反法西斯大会，纪念“五·三○事件”。五月三十日，已成为日本人民不能忘记的日子。一九四九年五月三十日，日本反动政府曾对东京劳动群众的示威游行进行血腥镇压，残杀了交通工人桥本金二；一九五○年五月三十日，美、日反动派武装镇压东京人民大会，并逮捕了八名日本爱国者；一九五二年五月三十日，日本警察横暴镇压全国各地的群众集会，大批屠杀和逮捕日本爱国人民。
    东京今年的“五·三○”纪念大会是由全日本金属工会东京分会等许多工会组织和日本国民救援会等人民团体主持召开的。参加大会的有“五·三○”、“松川”、“五一”等日本吉田政府镇压和迫害要求和平民主的日本人民的事件中的被害者和他们的家属、保释中的被告以及工人、市民、学生等二千多人。
    在会上，“五·三○事件”的受害者樱井孝广的母亲、“五一事件”的被告冈本光雄、“松川事件”的被告二阶堂园子等和东京机械制作所、日产化学工业公司等工会的代表都登台讲演。他们用亲身体验的血泪事实控诉美、日反动派对日本人民的血腥镇压，并呼吁日本人民团结起来反对法西斯统治，保卫人权与和平。（附图片）
