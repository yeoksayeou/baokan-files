Xinhua News Agency, Stockholm, May 31st: TASS reports from Stockholm on May 28th: The Swedish bourgeois newspaper "Dagens Nyheter" in Stockholm published several editorials expressing alarm about the consequences of the North Atlantic Military Alliance policy.

	In an editorial titled "Post-War Psychological State," "Dagens Nyheter" stated that including some countries in the North Atlantic Treaty had not helped achieve the so-called "equilibrium." The newspaper said:

	"For example, if Norway, Denmark, or other small countries had not joined the North Atlantic Treaty, it would not have been of any importance to the real balance of power. On the contrary, people fear that including Northern Europe in the North Atlantic Treaty's scope of activities will complicate the recently discussed base issue. This can only worsen the situation."

	The newspaper continued, stating that there had been alliances between great powers in the past, but these alliances were different from the North Atlantic Treaty. In the past, each participating country maintained its sovereignty and implemented its own diplomatic and military policies. "However, within the North Atlantic Treaty, sovereignty is restricted. The so-called joint base master plan, etc., actually seems to mean that the United States is the commanding leader." The newspaper also said that the United States bears the expenses of the North Atlantic Group to some extent, "but this cannot lead to the conclusion that the United States armed forces should occupy bases in every European country."

	In another editorial titled "Applying Pressure on Neighboring Countries," "Dagens Nyheter" discussed the recent statements made by representatives of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's Northern European Command regarding the necessity of stationing foreign troops at bases in Norway. The newspaper said: "These statements convincingly demonstrate that our Scandinavian neighbors are constantly subjected to behind-the-scenes pressure, the purpose of which is to force these countries to no longer resist providing bases and allowing troops to be stationed on their territory."

	"Dagens Nyheter" said: "Military representatives speak bluntly and disregard the status of some small countries or the sense of freedom of their people." The newspaper expressed dissatisfaction with this.

### 瑞典资产阶级报纸  不满北大西洋军事联盟政策

    不满北大西洋军事联盟政策
    【新华社三十一日讯】塔斯社斯德哥尔摩二十八日讯：斯德哥尔摩的瑞典资产阶级报纸“新闻报”登载了几篇社论，对北大西洋军事联盟政策的后果表示惊惶。
    在一篇题为“战后的心理状态”的社论中，“新闻报”说，把一些国家包括在北大西洋公约之内，并没有对达到所谓“均势”有任何帮助。该报说：
    “譬如说，如果挪威、丹麦或其他小国没有参加北大西洋公约，这对真正的势力均衡不会有什么重要性。相反地，人们害怕把北欧包括在北大西洋公约的活动范围之内，将使最近讨论过的基地问题复杂化。这只能使局势恶化。”
    该报接着说，过去在大国之间有过联盟，但是这种联盟与北大西洋公约不同，过去每一个参加国都保持它的主权，执行它自己的外交与军事政策。“可是在北大西洋公约之内，主权受到限制。所谓联合基地的总计划等等，实际上似乎意味着，美国是发号施令的领导国。”该报并说，美国在某种程度上负担北大西洋集团的开支，“但不能因此就得出结论说，美国武装部队应该占领每一个欧洲国家的基地。”
    “新闻报”在另外一篇以“对邻国施行压力”为题的社论中，论及北大西洋公约集团北欧区司令部的代表们在最近所发表的、关于有必要在挪威的基地上驻扎外国军队的声明。该报说：“这些声明有说服力地证明了，我们的斯堪的纳维亚邻国不断受到幕后的压力，这些压力的目的在于迫使这些国家不再抗拒供给基地与容许在它们的领土上驻军。”
    “新闻报”说：“军事代表们讲话时毫不客气，并且毫不顾及一些小国家的地位或它们人民的自由感。”该报对于这一点表示不满。
