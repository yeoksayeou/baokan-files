    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, June 10th: "Komsomolskaya Pravda" published extensive news, documents, and commentaries on June 9th regarding the 12th Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the All-Union Leninist Young Communist League, which was held in Moscow recently. The meeting discussed the issue of the Kuibyshev Oblast Young Communist League organization's participation in striving to fulfill the Five-Year Plan tasks, the issue of the Young Communist League organization's participation in improving the work of general schools for young workers and peasants, and the issue of the Soviet youth delegation's participation in the 4th World Youth and Student Festival for Peace and Friendship.

    The newspaper published the plenary session's decision on the first issue. The decision pointed out: Under the leadership of the Soviet Communist Party organizations, the Kuibyshev Oblast Young Communist League organization has done a great deal of work in attracting young workers and peasants to participate in emulation to complete and over fulfill production plans, improve product quality, and reduce production costs. However, there are shortcomings in the state's Young Communist League organization's work in carrying out emulation among young people. The Young Communist League organizations at all levels in the state have not made good use of socialist labor emulation as one of the main methods of carrying out communist education and improving labor enthusiasm for young people. They have not shown enough creativity and combat effectiveness in carrying out emulation among young people. Many Young Communist League workers and activists rarely consult with enterprise leaders, engineering and technical personnel, and agricultural specialists on socialist emulation issues, often do not know the tasks facing enterprises and collective farms, and do not care about the reasons for the backwardness of individual production departments. Therefore, the work of carrying out socialist emulation among young people is carried out by outsiders, is not specific, and does not take into account the current specific tasks of enterprises and collective farms, but is replaced by general calls. Some Young Communist League committees have attempted to organize socialist emulation among young people outside of the trade union organizations. The Young Communist League organization does not pay enough attention to organizing the labor and life of young workers. The decision instructed the Young Communist League organizations at all levels in the Kuibyshev Oblast to overcome these shortcomings in their work, called on them to attract more young people to socialist emulation, and to give play to the creativity and initiative of young people in realizing the tasks of the Fifth Five-Year Plan. On the basis of strengthening political education and organizational work, it is necessary to enable young workers and peasants to systematically improve labor productivity, master new technologies, and persistently seek and fully use production potential, so as to constantly contribute to the cause of communist construction. The decision emphasized that the Young Communist League organization must take into account the specific tasks of each enterprise department when carrying out emulation among young people. It is necessary to ensure that Young Communist League members and young people actively participate in the construction of the great communist construction project - the Kuibyshev Hydropower Station. The plenary session requested the Young Communist League organization to participate in making a summary of the emulation, and to promote the achievements of advanced producers in the Young Communist League newspaper, radio, youth conferences, and production technology conferences, and strive to make their experience the property of all young people.

    "Komsomolskaya Pravda" also published an editorial on this decision, pointing out that this decision is a broad program for the work of the All-Union Young Communist League organization. The editorial said: The Young Communist League organization will strive to make young people more actively participate in the socialist emulation to strive for the victorious completion of the Fifth Five-Year Plan. The Young Communist League organization will more actively help the Party organization carry out the struggle for a new upsurge in all sectors of the national economy and for the victory of communism in the Soviet Union.

    苏联青年团中央举行第十二次全体会议
    号召更广泛吸引青年到社会主义竞赛中去
    【新华社莫斯科十日电】“青年团真理报”九日以大量篇幅刊载了关于苏联列宁共产主义青年团中央委员会第十二次全体会议的消息、文件和评论。这次全体会议于日前在莫斯科举行。会上讨论了关于古比雪夫州青年团组织参加争取完成五年计划任务的问题，关于青年团组织参加改进工农青年普通学校的工作的问题，以及关于苏联青年代表团参加第四届世界青年与学生和平与友好联欢节的问题。
    该报刊载了全体会议关于第一个问题的决定。决定指出：在苏联共产党组织的领导下，古比雪夫州青年团组织在吸引工农青年参加争取完成和超额完成生产计划、提高产品质量和减低产品成本等竞赛方面做了不少工作。但州青年团组织在青年中开展竞赛工作中存在着缺点。该州各级青年团组织没有很好地运用社会主义劳动竞赛作为对青年进行共产主义教育、提高劳动积极性的主要方法之一。对于在青年中开展竞赛没有表现足够的创造性和战斗性。许多青年团工作者和积极分子很少跟企业领导人、工程技术人员、农业专门人员、生产革新者商量社会主义竞赛问题，常常不知道企业和集体农庄面临的任务，不关心个别生产部门落后的原因，因此在青年中开展社会主义竞赛的工作进行得外行，不具体，不估计企业和集体农庄当前的具体任务，而代之以一般的号召。有些青年团委员会企图离开工会组织在青年中组织社会主义竞赛。青年团组织不够注意组织青年工人的劳动和生活。决定责成古比雪夫州各级青年团组织克服这些工作上的缺点，号召更加广泛地吸引青年到社会主义竞赛中去，发挥青年在实现第五个五年计划任务中的创造性和积极性。要在加强政治教育和组织工作的基础上，使工农青年有系统地提高劳动生产率、掌握新技术、坚持地寻找和充分使用生产潜力，以便经常地对共产主义建设事业有所贡献。决定着重指出，青年团组织在青年中开展竞赛时必须估计到各个企业部门的具体任务。必须保证青年团员和青年们积极参加伟大的共产主义建设工程——古比雪夫水电站的建设工作。全体会议要求青年团组织参加作竞赛总结，在团报、广播和青年会议上，在生产技术会议上推广先进生产者的成就，争取使他们的经验成为全体青年的财产。
    “青年团真理报”并就这一决定发表社论指出，这个决定是全苏联青年团组织工作的广泛纲领。社论说：青年团组织将争取青年更加积极地参加争取胜利地完成第五个五年计划的社会主义竞赛。青年团组织将更加积极地帮助党的组织进行争取国民经济所有部门的新高涨，争取共产主义在苏联的胜利的斗争。
