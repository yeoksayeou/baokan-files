	Our Soviet-Style Life
	Soviet Union  Te. Kuzminova
	Our family suffered misfortune during the Great Patriotic War. My husband sacrificed himself in the battle against the German fascist aggressors. I was left alone with four children. If this had been before the revolution, I really don't know how I would have raised these children. But the Soviet government would not ignore people's misfortunes.
	Immediately after the children lost their father, I received a pension from the state to raise them. I sent my youngest daughter, Margarita, and my son, Leonid, to kindergarten. The kindergarten is not far from our factory. This provides a lot of convenience for mothers, because it eliminates the need to spend a lot of time taking care of the children.
	My children, like all the children in the kindergarten, receive great care. They play happily all day long and do beneficial things. Under the guidance of experienced nursery staff, they learn embroidery, drawing, modeling, reciting poems, singing, and dancing.
	Every summer, Margarita and Leonid go from kindergarten to summer resorts. They play in the forest. Health workers take care of them bathing and sunbathing. When we welcome those children who have grown up healthily and tanned black and red from the summer resorts back to the city, how happy the mothers are!
	The children in the senior classes of kindergarten have already learned many useful things. The nursery staff prepares them for entering elementary school, tells them about their parents' production work, and talks to them about the happy life of Soviet children.
	We have great trust in the child-rearing institutions. The female workers can work in the factory with peace of mind, because their children are reliably entrusted.
	The state spends a large amount of money on child-rearing institutions, and this amount is increasing year by year. Take our Ivanovo as an example. The number of kindergartens and nurseries is increasing year by year, and beautiful and well-equipped buildings are being built for them every year. This shows the Soviet state's concern for the younger generation.
	Now I would like to talk about how our factory committee and the entire fraternal working-class family care about me personally. I didn't have good professional knowledge before. Once the chairman of the factory committee called me in and said to me:
	"Tasia Alekseyevna, do you want to master technology?"
	I thought about it and agreed. After the chairman of the factory committee discussed it with the administration, they told me to learn forging work.
	Technical groups and Stakhanov training classes often worked in our workshop, and I also participated in the technical group study. In the study, I mastered knowledge, consolidated this knowledge with the experience of Stakhanov workers, and became a female worker with a high level of professional skills. The administration valued my diligence and hard work, so they transferred me to be an inspector.
	My work is very much to my liking, and I don't have to worry about the children. Leonid is now twelve years old, and he is in the fifth grade. Every summer he goes to the children's summer camp in the scenic area of ​​New Talyze for vacation. Hundreds of students go there during the summer vacation. They have good food and fun cultural entertainment there.
	When my daughters studied at school, they also went to children's summer camps for vacation. Alipina had an interesting and fascinating trip along the Volga River with other children in a water sports summer camp. The youngest daughter, Margarita, even toured Moscow at the expense of the factory committee.
	Not long ago, at a school meeting, the female teacher asked me to talk to the parents of the students about how I raised my children. What can I say? My children are very diligent, help me with housework, and they hope to become useful people to society. It is not just me who is raising them; the school, the factory, and our country are all helping me raise them. When the children were in kindergarten, they had already developed good habits, and the school consolidated these good habits.
	We have a Children's Palace in Ivanovo. It is one of the best buildings in the city. Elementary school students often go to the Children's Palace after school, study in various technical groups, learn music, and participate in extracurricular recreational activities. These interesting works enrich their knowledge and help them choose their future careers. The youngest daughter, Margarita, also went to the Children's Palace to participate in technical group work. She likes architecture very much. After graduating from the seven-year school, she entered the Ivanovo Industrial School, and she hopes to become an architectural technician. Margarita will be the third technician in our family.
	Alipina loved growing flowers since she was a child, and she likes orchards. After graduating from the Public Construction Technical School, she went to Molotov City to work on urban greening, and she is currently building new street gardens.
	The eldest daughter, Lia, chose another career. She graduated from the Ivanovo Public Nutrition School. She now lives in Gusev City, Kaliningrad Oblast, and works as a production director in the cafeteria. My daughters studied at technical schools for free and also received scholarships.
	My son Leonid likes things about cars. He wants to study at the Automotive Transportation Technical School. But I have another idea. I want him to graduate from the ten-year school and enter a specialized school to become an engineer in the future.
	This is how our family lives. I often think about what the fate of my children would be like without the Soviet regime. In the situation before the revolution, the daughters must have been working for the factory owners. But they grew up in the Soviet era, and in this era they received education, so their fate is happy.
	I want to express my gratitude for the happiness that my children can obtain with Stakhanov-style work.

    我们的苏维埃式的生活
    苏联  特·库兹明诺娃
    我们的家庭在伟大卫国战争时期遭到了不幸。我的丈夫在与德国法西斯侵略者作战时牺牲了。剩下我一个人带着四个孩子。如果这是在革命以前的话，我真不知道怎样抚养大这些孩子。但苏维埃政府是不会不管人们的不幸的。
    孩子们丧失了父亲后，我立刻就从国家领到了养育孩子们的抚恤金。我把小女儿玛尔加丽塔和儿子列奥尼德送进了幼儿园。幼儿园离我们的工厂不远。这给母亲们不少方便，因为这就无需把很多的时间花在照料孩子上面。
    我的孩子和幼儿园中所有的孩子一样，受到很大的关怀。他们一天到晚快乐地游玩，做有益的事情。在一些有经验的保育员的指导下，他们学习刺绣，画画，塑模型，朗诵诗篇，唱歌和跳舞。
    每年夏季，玛尔加丽塔和列奥尼德都要从幼儿园到避暑地去。他们在森林里游玩。卫生工作人员照顾着他们洗澡和进行日光浴。当我们迎接那些从避暑地回到城里来的长得茁壮的、晒得黑红黑红的孩子们时，做母亲的是多么满心地高兴啊！
    幼儿园高级班的孩子们已经懂得了许多有用的东西。保育员使他们为进小学校而有所准备，对他们讲述父母亲的生产工作，跟他们谈苏联儿童的幸福生活。
    我们对教养儿童的机关非常信任。女工们都能很安心地到工厂去工作，因为她们的孩子有了可靠的托付。
    国家把很大一笔钱用在教养儿童机关方面，这笔钱还在一年一年地增加。就拿我们伊凡诺佛来说吧。幼儿园和托儿所的数目年年都在增加，年年都在为它们建筑漂亮和设备很好的房屋。由这一点就可以看出苏维埃国家对年青一代的关心了。
    现在我来谈谈我们工厂委员会和整个友爱的工人大家庭对我个人是如何的关心。我以前没有很好的专业知识。有一次工厂委员会主席把我叫去，对我说：
    “塔西亚·阿列克塞耶夫娜，你想要掌握技术吗？”
    我想了一下就同意了。工厂委员会主席和行政上商量好以后就叫我学做模锻工作。
    技术小组和斯大哈诺夫训练班经常在我们车间里工作，我也参加了技术小组学习。在学习中掌握了知识，用斯大哈诺夫工作者的经验巩固了这些知识，并且变成了一个有高度业务水平的女工。行政上很重视我的勤快和努力，就调我做检查员。
    我的工作很合我的心愿，孩子们也不用我操心。列奥尼德现在已经十二岁，他在五年级读书。每年夏天他都要到新塔利泽一带风景区的儿童夏令营中去休假。暑假期间有几百个学生到那里去。他们在那里既有好吃的东西又有好玩的文化娱乐。
    我的女儿们在学校学习时，也到儿童夏令营度假。阿丽平娜曾在水上儿童夏令营和其他儿童们沿伏尔加河作了一次有趣的，令人神往的旅行。小女儿玛尔加丽塔还由工厂委员会负担费用到莫斯科游览过。
    不久以前，在学校会议上，女教师要我向学生的家长们谈谈我是怎样教养孩子的。我能讲些什么呢？我的孩子们很用功，帮助我料理家务，他们希望成为社会上有用的人。并不单独是我在教养他们；学校、工厂和我们的国家都在帮助我教养他们。当孩子们还在幼儿园的时候就已养成良好的习惯，学校使这些良好的习惯巩固起来。
    我们伊凡诺佛有一所少年宫。这是城里最好的建筑之一。小学生们在课余常到少年宫去，在各种技术小组中学习，还学习音乐，参加课外文娱活动。这些有趣的工作丰富了他们的知识，帮助他们选择未来的职业。小女儿玛尔加丽塔也到少年宫去参加过技术小组工作。她对建筑方面很欢喜。她在七年制学校毕业后，就进入伊凡诺佛工业学校，她希望成为一个建筑技师。玛尔加丽塔将是我们家里第三个技术人员。
    阿丽平娜从小就爱种花，她喜欢果园。她在公共建设技术学校毕业后，就到莫洛托夫城去做城市绿化工作，她目前正在建设新的街心花园。
    大女儿丽雅选择了另一种职业。她是在伊凡诺佛的公共营养学校毕业的。她现在住在加里宁格勒州古塞夫城，在食堂中当生产主任。我的女儿们在技术学校中学习都是免费的，而且还领奖学金。
    我的儿子列奥尼德喜欢汽车方面的事情。他想到汽车运输技术学校学习。但是我有另外一种想法。想叫他在十年制学校毕业后，进入专科学校，将来当一名工程师。
    我们家庭的生活就是这样的。我常常想到，如果没有苏维埃政权的话，我的孩子们的命运不知要怎样。在革命以前的情形下女儿们一定是在替工厂主工作。可是她们是生长在苏维埃时代，在这个时代受教育，所以她们的命运是幸福的。
    我的孩子们能获得这样的幸福，我要用斯大哈诺夫式的工作来表示感谢。
