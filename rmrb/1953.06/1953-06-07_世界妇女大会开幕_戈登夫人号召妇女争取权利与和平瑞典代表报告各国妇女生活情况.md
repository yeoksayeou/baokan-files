Xinhua News Agency, Copenhagen, June 6th: The World Women's Congress opened on the morning of June 5th at the Sports Palace in Copenhagen. The hall was decorated with the flags of various countries and large banners, which read in various languages: "Long Live the World Women's Congress! Women all over the world fight for and defend our rights! Fight to defend our children and our families! Fight for world peace!"

More than 800 delegates and over 1,000 guests from 85 countries are participating in the conference, and some delegates are expected to arrive on the 6th. Representatives from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Vietnam, and Malaya were unable to attend the conference because the Danish authorities refused to issue entry visas.

After the opening of the conference, Ruth Hermann, Chairman of the Danish Democratic Women's League, first congratulated the delegates. Then, the conference unanimously elected a presidium headed by Mrs. Gordon.

In her opening speech, Mrs. Gordon said: Women are facing a great task. The current situation makes all women feel more deeply their responsibility to their children. The last war, as well as the wars currently being waged, are a heavy burden on civilians. It is for this very reason that more and more women are enthusiastically participating in the great peace movement.

Mrs. Gordon said: If women unite their strength, this conference will become a decisive stage in their struggle for their rights and for peace and the happiness of children.

The conference adopted the following agenda: 1. The tasks of women in the struggle to win and defend the rights of women as mothers, workers, and citizens; 2. The achievements and prospects of women's actions to defend peace and the interests of women and children; 3. Election of the leading body of the Women's International Democratic Federation.

Swedish representative Andre Andreen made a report on the first item on the agenda at the afternoon meeting. She described the situation of women in various countries, emphasizing that "we women account for half of humanity, and we know that we should enjoy equal rights with men." Andre Andreen continued: After the Second World War, women intensified their struggle for equality and public opinion support, which led the United Nations to declare the principle of equality between men and women and advise governments to grant women the rights they need. But in fact, these principles are implemented very unsatisfactorily. Many governments ignore this principle, while others only give women certain rights in form without guaranteeing how these rights will be realized. Millions of women have no rights at all. The only exceptions are the Soviet Union, China, and the People's Democratic countries.

When talking about the situation of women in various countries, Andre Andreen cited convincing examples to show that in capitalist countries, dependent countries, and colonial countries, women are discriminated against in education, civil rights, and economic life. For example, women in the United States do the same work as men, but their wages are only 60 to 70 percent of men's, while black women's wages are only 40 percent of white women's.

In the United Kingdom, women's wages are only 53 percent of men's.

Andre Andreen said: As a result of this discrimination, women in capitalist countries cannot participate in public and political life on an equal footing with men. Even in some countries where the law allows them to, they cannot actually do so. For example, in the United States, Spain, Iran, and Brazil, women's political rights are restricted by various conditions such as education, residency requirements, and property.

Andre Andreen elaborated on the serious situation that all working people, including women, are in due to the arms race and war preparations in capitalist countries, as well as the accompanying increase in prices and rents, increased taxes, and increased unemployment. All these, as well as the wars in Korea, Vietnam, and Malaya, have caused the destruction of many families in capitalist countries, colonies, and dependent countries, and have caused the death of millions of people and children.

Andre Andreen said that the situation in the Soviet Union, China, and the People's Democratic countries is completely different, where peaceful construction is underway. She particularly emphasized the equal status enjoyed by women in these countries.

Andre Andreen listed the demands of women and their tasks in the struggle for women's rights, pointing out that women need to enjoy guaranteed rights equal to those of men in all aspects of life. They demand that their families can enjoy happiness, that they no longer have to worry about tomorrow, and that they be free from the danger of new wars. All these demands are realistic and achievable. Andre Andreen urged all women, especially the delegates to the conference, to strengthen the struggle for women's rights and international peace.

### 世界妇女大会开幕  戈登夫人号召妇女争取权利与和平瑞典代表报告各国妇女生活情况

    世界妇女大会开幕
    戈登夫人号召妇女争取权利与和平瑞典代表报告各国妇女生活情况
    【新华社六日讯】据塔斯社哥本哈根六日讯：世界妇女大会于六月五日上午在哥本哈根的体育大厦开幕。会场内悬挂着各国的国旗和大幅标语，标语上用各种文字写着：“世界妇女大会万岁！全世界妇女为争取和保卫我们的权利而斗争！为保卫我们的孩子和我们的家庭而斗争！为争取世界和平而斗争！”
    参加大会的有来自八十五个国家的八百多位代表及来宾一千多人，还有一些代表将于六日到达。由于丹麦当局拒发入境签证，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国、越南和马来亚的代表未能出席大会。
    大会开幕后，首先由丹麦民主妇女联合会主席鲁思·赫尔曼向代表们致贺。接着，大会一致选出以戈登夫人为首的主席团。
    戈登夫人在开幕词中说：妇女们面临着一种伟大的任务。目前的情况使得全体妇女不得不更深深地感觉到她们对自己的孩子的责任。上一次战争以及现在正在进行的战争，是平民的一种沉重负担。正是为了这个缘故，才有越来越多的妇女热心地参加伟大的和平运动。
    戈登夫人说：妇女们把她们的力量联合起来，就将使这次大会成为她们争取自己的权利、争取和平与儿童幸福的斗争中的一个决定性的阶段。
    大会通过以下的议程：一、妇女在争取和保卫妇女作为母亲、工人和公民的权利的斗争中的任务；二、妇女为保卫和平与妇女和孩子的利益而采取的行动的成就与展望；三、选举国际民主妇女联合会领导机构。
    瑞典代表安德烈·安德琳在下午会议上就第一项议程作了报告。她叙述了各国妇女的情况，并强调说：“我们妇女占人类的半数，我们知道我们应享有与男子平等的权利。”安德烈·安德琳接着说：第二次大战以后，妇女加紧争取平等的斗争及舆论的支持，使得联合国宣布了男女平等的原则，并劝告各国政府给予妇女以她们所需要的权利。但是事实上这些原则实行得很不能令人满意。许多政府忽视这个原则，另外一些政府仅在形式上给予妇女某些权利，而没有对于如何实现这些权利提出保证。千百万妇女什么权利也没有。唯一例外的是苏联、中国和各人民民主国家。
    安德烈·安德琳谈到各国妇女的情况时，举出令人信服的例子，说明在资本主义国家、附属国和殖民地国家里，妇女无论在受教育、公民权利和经济生活各方面都受到歧视。例如美国妇女和男子做同样的工作，但所得工资只及男子的百分之六十到七十，而黑人妇女的工资，又只有白人妇女的百分之四十。
    在英国，妇女的工资只有男子的百分之五十三。
    安德烈·安德琳说：这种种歧视的结果，就使得资本主义国家中的妇女不能以平等地位和男子一样地参加公共生活和政治生活。即使在有些国家，法律允许她们，但实际上她们也不能做到这样。例如在美国、西班牙、伊朗和巴西，妇女的政治权利就受到教育、居住期限、财产等种种条件的限制。
    安德烈·安德琳详尽地谈到，由于资本主义国家扩军备战，以及随之而来的物价和房租的上涨，捐税加重，失业人数的增加，全体劳动人民，包括妇女在内，处于怎样严重的情况。所有这些以及朝鲜、越南、马来亚的战争，造成资本主义国家、殖民地和附属国内许多家庭的毁灭，造成千百万人民和儿童的死亡。
    安德烈·安德琳说：苏联、中国和各人民民主国家的情形就完全不同了，那儿正进行着和平的建设。她并特别强调指出这些国家的妇女所享有的平等地位。
    安德烈·安德琳列举了妇女的要求和她们在争取妇女权利的斗争中的任务，她指出，妇女需要在生活的各方面享有与男子平等的有保障的权利。她们要求她们的家庭能享受快乐，她们要求不必再为明天焦虑，要求免于新战争的危险。所有这些要求都是现实而且可以实现的。安德烈·安德琳促请全体的妇女、首先是大会的代表们，加强争取妇女权利及国际和平的斗争。
