    Zhejiang Province Corrects Tendency to Neglect Mountainous Area Production
    Various areas in Zhejiang are strengthening leadership over production in mountainous regions. In the past, many regions led rural production using generalized methods, focusing on plains areas and neglecting mountainous regions. This bias is now beginning to be corrected. The Quzhou Prefectural Commissioner's Office convened a symposium of farmer representatives from mountainous areas to study the problems existing in mountainous area production in the past and methods for improving leadership in mountainous area production in the future. Bai Changyi, Deputy Secretary of the CPC Kaihua County Committee, and others went deep into mountain villages to study methods for increasing the production of mountain crops. The CPC Shouchang County Committee established base point townships in mountainous areas. The CPC Zhuji County Committee also sent special personnel to investigate the situation in mountainous areas and jointly study with local people methods for striving for a bumper harvest in mountainous areas.
    The mountainous area of Quzhou Prefecture is very large, accounting for 83% of the total land area of the entire prefecture. Mountainous area products are also abundant, including native and special products such as pine wood, fir wood, bamboo, tea, and tallow seeds, as well as crops such as corn, sweet potatoes, potatoes, and millet. In addition, there are sideline productions such as papermaking, ash burning, and hunting. Mountainous area farmers mainly rely on corn and sweet potatoes as staple foods, with rice, millet, and potatoes as supplementary foods. In the few years since liberation, the lives of farmers in mountainous areas have been initially improved, and they have basically escaped the poor life of "filling their bellies with wild grass" in the past. However, the improvement in the lives of farmers in mountainous areas is uneven. Areas with fertile soil, abundant native and special products, and relatively convenient transportation (accounting for about 60% of the total mountainous area) have improved faster, while areas with barren soil, few special products, and very inconvenient transportation (accounting for about 40% of the total mountainous area) have improved more slowly.
    According to the reflections of farmer representatives from mountainous areas in Quzhou Prefecture at the symposium: the potential of mountainous area production has not been fully realized, and the yield per unit area of ​​crops and economic crops can be greatly increased. Jin Xiangfu, a farmer from Yejia Yang Township, Jiangshan County, used the improved variety "Fifty Days" sweet potato seedlings last year, and fifty sweet potato plants yielded 380 jin, with an average of more than seven jin per plant; the sweet potatoes of other local farmers generally only yielded about twelve liang per plant. Another example is tung trees produced in the Huangshayao District of Suichang County, which are very profitable, but because farmers do not clear the tung hills, they can only harvest for three years; if the weeds on the tung hills are cleared, they can be harvested for more than ten years. In addition, there are more than 8,744,400 mu of barren mountains in mountainous areas, and many areas have a large number of economic forests (tea trees, tallow trees, etc.) that have not been fully utilized. To realize these potentials, it is first necessary to correctly implement the mountainous area production policy. In the past, many places did not proceed from actual conditions in terms of closing mountains for forest protection and reasonable felling, and did not take into account the needs of the masses, causing adverse consequences. Farmers requested to cut down a few pieces of wood for repairing bridges and farm tools, but it was not approved; when closing mountains, even thatch mountains and firewood mountains were closed, so that the masses had no place to cut firewood or graze. The policy of "whoever plants it harvests it" has not been correctly implemented, and the property of farmers has been infringed upon in some areas. In procurement and supply work, state-owned trade departments and cooperatives have also failed to implement the price policy well and have not correctly grasped the principles of superior quality, superior price, and low quality, low price; some units have a purely profit-seeking viewpoint and a mandatory command style, etc. These situations have hindered the enthusiasm of farmers in mountainous areas for production.
    Based on the problems reflected by the farmer representatives in mountainous areas, the Quzhou Prefectural Commissioner's Office, after research, proposed methods for improving the leadership of mountainous area production:
    (1) Strengthen the leadership of mountainous area production from top to bottom, further overcome the idea among cadres that only emphasizes the production of plains areas and neglects the production of mountainous areas, proceed from reality, and change the bureaucratic work style of being divorced from reality and the masses in leading mountainous area production in the past. Each county and district should have a main leading cadre in charge of mountainous area production, create experience in leading mountainous area production, and summarize and promote it. Strengthen ideological and policy education for cadres in mountainous areas, and hold meetings of cadres in mountainous areas and meetings of farmer representatives in mountainous areas regularly with districts or townships as units to study and arrange mountainous area production work.
    (2) Tap the potential of mountainous area production and improve the lives of farmers in mountainous areas. The main methods are: improve production technology and increase the yield per unit area of ​​corn and sweet potatoes; utilize barren mountains in a planned way, vigorously build timber forests, appropriately build economic forests that sell well, and focus on developing animal husbandry; carry out inter-tillage and weeding for already barren economic forests, improve management technology, increase yield, and improve quality; earnestly strengthen the leadership of supply and marketing cooperatives, rectify the business style, improve business management, so as to invigorate the mountainous area economy, smooth cooperative trade, and help farmers in mountainous areas solve the problem of selling various local and special products and supplying the necessities of life for farmers in mountainous areas; steadily organize scattered farmers in mountainous areas in a leadership-led manner, and rectify the existing mutual aid teams.
    (3) Correctly implement various policies related to farmers in mountainous areas. It is necessary to combine the current interests of farmers with long-term interests and local interests with overall interests from the actual needs of developing mountainous area production and preventing floods, and correct the phenomenon of blindly closing mountains for forest protection in the past that disregarded actual conditions and the current living needs of farmers; mountains and forests that have been closed but should not have been closed should be opened to avoid affecting the production and life of the masses. It is necessary to correctly implement commercial policies, reasonably evaluate and purchase local and special products in accordance with the principles of superior quality, superior price, low quality, low price, and production based on sales, and earnestly correct the phenomenon of infringing on the interests of farmers in mountainous areas in the procurement work of some state-owned companies and cooperatives in the past.
    More than 90% of the area of ​​Kaihua County is mountainous, with very little plains. There are twenty-two townships where farmers rely on growing corn and tea trees for a living. Farmers in mountainous areas urgently demand to improve the planting technology of crops such as corn and tea, increase yields, and improve their lives; but in the past, leading cadres at the county, district, and township levels led mountainous area production by using the methods of leading production in plains areas, and talked about rice cultivation technology and calculated small-plant dense planting accounts at every meeting. The masses were very dissatisfied with this and felt that there was no way to increase the production of mountain crops. Cadres also felt that it was impossible to lead production in mountainous areas. In order to solve this problem, Bai Changyi, Deputy Secretary of the CPC Kaihua County Committee, and Hu Yuhuai, Director of the Agriculture and Forestry Section of the County Government, went deep into Shunshan Village, Huashan Township, the base point in the mountainous area, to study methods for increasing the production of crops such as corn and tea with the farmers. After Comrade Bai Changyi discussed and studied with old farmers and mutual aid team leaders, he summarized the methods for increasing the production of corn and tea, and introduced them to many villages in the mountainous area. After discussion, the farmers in each village changed their thinking that there was no way to increase the production of mountain crops and increased their confidence in increasing production.
    In the past, the leading cadres of Zhuji County did not work in depth and their work style was old-fashioned, with a "pure rice viewpoint." Farmers in mountainous areas reflected: "Government cadres only talk about increasing rice production, and provide a large amount of fertilizer to those who grow rice, but they don't even talk to us in mountainous areas; if we put some bean cake and bittern crystals in the sorghum and sweet potato fields, the county and district cadres will also label us as 'not valuing rice.' If this continues, we can only drink the southeast wind!" In order to change this situation, the CPC Zhuji County Committee sent special personnel to investigate the mountainous area. When studying methods to increase production in mountainous areas with the masses in mountainous areas, the enthusiasm of the masses was very high; they put forward some opinions on product sales and fertilizer loans, and also put forward many methods for increasing the production of mountain crops. The County Committee combined the opinions of the masses and formulated a plan to improve the leadership of mountainous area production; it is now carrying out work according to this plan.

    浙江各地纠正忽视山区生产的偏向
    浙江各地正在加强对山区生产的领导。过去，许多地区用一般化的方法领导农村生产，重视平原地区，忽视山区，这种偏向现在已开始纠正。衢州专署曾召集山区农民代表座谈，研究了过去山区生产中存在的问题和今后改进山区生产的领导工作的方法。中共开化县委副书记等深入山村研究了山区农作物的增产办法。中共寿昌县委在山区设了基点乡。中共诸暨县委也派出专人对山区情况作了调查，和当地群众共同研究了争取山区丰收的办法。
    衢州专区的山区面积很大，占全区土地总面积的百分之八十三；山区的产品也很多，土产特产有松木、杉木、毛竹、茶叶、桕子等，农作物有玉米、蕃薯、洋芋、小米等，另外还有做纸、烧灰、打猎等副业生产。山区农民都以玉米、蕃薯为主粮，大米、小米、洋芋等为辅粮。解放后几年来，山区农民的生活已有了初步的改善，基本上已摆脱了过去那种“野草充肚饱”的贫苦生活。但山区农民生活的改善是不平衡的，土质肥沃、土产特产丰富、交通比较便利的地区（约占全部山区面积的百分之六十）改善得较快，土质贫瘠、土特产少、交通很不便利的地区（约占全部山区面积的百分之四十）改善得较慢。
    据衢州专区山区农民代表在座谈会上反映：山区生产的潜力没有发挥出来，农作物、经济作物的单位面积产量还可以大大提高。江山县叶家洋乡农民金祥富去年采用良种“五十日”薯苗，五十株蕃薯就收了三百八十斤，平均每株有七斤多重；当地其他农民的蕃薯，每株一般只收十二两左右。又如遂昌县黄沙腰区出产桐子，收益很大，但因农民不铲桐山，只能收三年；如果把桐山上的杂草铲除，就可以收到十几年。此外，山区还有八百七十四万四千余亩荒山荒芜着，不少地区还有大批经济林（茶树、桕子等）没有充分利用。要发挥这些潜力，首先要正确地贯彻山区生产政策。过去很多地方在封山护林和合理采伐方面，不从实际情况出发，不照顾群众需要，引起不良后果。农民为了修桥、修农具，要求砍几根木头，也不批准；封山时连茅草山、柴山都封起来，使群众砍柴、放牧的地方都没有。谁种谁收的政策也未正确贯彻，部分地区并侵犯了农民的财产。在收购和供应工作中，国营贸易部门和合作社也没有很好地贯彻价格政策，没有正确掌握优级优价、低级低价的原则；某些单位有单纯营利观点和强迫命令作风等。这些情况都妨碍了山区农民生产积极性的发挥。
    根据山区农民代表反映出来的这些问题，衢州专员公署经过研究，提出了改进山区生产领导工作的办法：
    （一）自上而下地加强对山区生产的领导，进一步克服干部中存在着的只重视平原地区的生产、忽视山区生产的思想，从实际出发，转变过去领导山区生产中脱离实际、脱离群众的官僚主义作风。各县、区应有一个主要领导干部掌握山区生产，创造领导山区生产的经验，加以总结推广。对山区干部加强思想教育和政策教育，定期以区或乡为单位召开山区干部会议和山区农民代表会议，研究、布置山区生产工作。
    （二）发掘山区生产潜在力，改善山区农民的生活。主要的办法是：改进生产技术，提高玉米、蕃薯的单位面积产量；有计划地利用荒山，大力营造用材林，适当营造有销路的经济林，重点发展畜牧业；对已荒芜的经济林，进行中耕除草，改进经营技术，提高产量，提高品质；切实加强对供销合作社的领导，端正经营作风，改善经营管理，以活跃山区经济，通畅合作贸易，帮助山区农民解决各种土产特产的推销和山区农民生活必需品的供应问题；要有领导地稳步地把分散的山区农民组织起来，对现有的互助组应加以整顿。
    （三）正确地贯彻与山区农民有关的各项政策。要从发展山区生产和防止水灾的实际需要出发，把农民的目前利益与长远利益、局部利益与整体利益结合起来，纠正过去那种不顾实际情况、不照顾农民当前的生活需要、盲目封山护林的现象；已封而不应封的山林，应予以开放，以免影响群众的生产和生活。要正确地贯彻商业政策，根据优级优价、低级低价和以销定产的原则，合理地做好土特产的评价、收购工作，切实纠正过去部分国营公司和合作社收购工作中侵犯山区农民利益的现象。
    开化县全境有百分之九十以上的面积是山地，平原很少，有二十二个乡的农民靠种玉米和茶树生活。山区农民迫切要求改进玉米、茶叶等作物的种植技术，增加产量，改善生活；但过去县、区、乡各级领导干部却以领导平原地区生产的办法去领导山区生产，每次开会都讲水稻栽培技术，算小株密植账。群众对这很不满意，感到山上作物增产没有办法。干部也觉得对山区生产无法领导。为了解决这个问题，中共开化县委副书记白长义和县府农林科科长胡玉怀，深入山区基点花桥乡舜山村，和农民研究山区的玉米、茶叶等作物的增产办法。白长义同志和老农民、互助组长座谈、研究以后，把玉米、茶叶的增产办法加以总结，又在山区的许多村子作了介绍。各村农民经过讨论，转变了认为山上作物没法增产的思想，提高了增产信心。
    诸暨县领导干部过去工作不深入，作风老一套，有“单纯水稻观点”。山区农民反映：“政府干部只会讲水田增产，对种稻子的人大量贷肥料，对我们山区连讲都不讲；我们放点豆饼、卤晶在六谷和番芋地里，县区干部还要给我们戴上‘不重视水稻’的大帽子。这样下去，我们只有喝东南风了！”中共诸暨县委为了改变这种情况，派专人到山区作了调查。当和山区群众研究山区增产办法的时候，群众的情绪十分高涨；他们对于产品销路和肥料贷款等提出了一些意见，对于山区作物的增产也提出了许多办法。县委把群众的意见综合起来，制定了改进山区生产领导工作的计划；现在正按照这个计划进行工作。
