The full text of the letter is as follows:

    Young Communist League Members and Youth Comrades of the Motherland! Friends!

    We are the Communication Squad where the Chinese People's Volunteer Army Special-Class Hero Huang Jiguang was stationed before his death. After the Battle of Shangganling, we received thousands of letters of sympathy from you and many books, photos, and the medals and certificates you gloriously obtained and transferred to us. We also received red scarves that many children cherish most. These precious gifts represent the feelings of the people of the motherland and give us great honor and encouragement. Seeing these precious gifts, we feel a hundred times more courageous. Thinking of these gifts, our determination and confidence to defend the motherland and defend peace are even stronger. We would like to express our heartfelt gratitude to you and pay our highest revolutionary respects! And we wish you greater achievements in your respective positions in the cause of building our great motherland, and the emergence of more labor heroes and model workers.

    Comrades! Friends! We are determined to be vigilant at all times, ready to crush any adventurous enemy attacks that would disrupt peace, and fight to the end to defend the construction of the motherland and defend world peace! We must learn from the great collectivist ideology of Communist Party member, model Young Communist League member, and Special-Class Hero Huang Jiguang, learn from his fearless courage and his noble qualities of boundless loyalty to the Party, the motherland, the people, and the cause of peace. We must maintain the lofty honor of the squad where Huang Jiguang was stationed before his death.

    Comrades! Friends! Let us unite more closely to fight together to defend and build our great motherland! Victory and glory must belong to us.

       Wishing you good health!

    Squad Leader Wang Xiwu, Deputy Squad Leader Xiao Dengliang, and all comrades of the Communication Squad of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, where Special-Class Hero Huang Jiguang was stationed before his death.
