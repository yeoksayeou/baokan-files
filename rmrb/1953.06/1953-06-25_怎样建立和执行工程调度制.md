How to Establish and Implement an Engineering Scheduling System

By Our Correspondent Chen Ji

How should an engineering scheduling system be established and implemented? The experiences and lessons learned from the trial implementation of a scheduling system in the Beijing Iron and Steel Industry Institute's construction site can answer this question.

Implementing an engineering scheduling system means carrying out frequent supervision and inspection based on the work plan, rationally allocating labor, materials, tools, and equipment, and preventing and eliminating shortcomings in the execution of the plan to ensure the realization of the work plan. This is the nature and purpose of the engineering scheduling system. Failure to understand this nature and purpose will lead to the failure of establishing an engineering scheduling system. At the beginning of this year, the construction site of the Beijing Iron and Steel Industry Institute established a scheduling office and assigned dispatchers, but it did not play a scheduling role. At that time, people did not understand why a scheduling office was established and regarded the scheduling office as a "secretarial office." The scheduling office had planning, statistics, scheduling, engineering, and construction technology departments, managing all the large and small tasks of the entire construction site. Even if the general affairs section wanted to make two benches or ten washboards, it had to be approved by the scheduling office. The scheduling personnel were signing and stamping documents every day, and they could not do scheduling work at all. In the responsibility system movement, by studying the Soviet experience of implementing the engineering scheduling system, they clearly recognized the nature and purpose of the scheduling system, changed the organization, and separated the planning, statistics, and engineering work so that the scheduling office could truly do scheduling work. The scheduling office was equipped with a scheduling director, dispatchers, and scheduling assistants; dispatchers were assigned to the first, second, and third construction sites, the supply section, the labor organization section, the tool and equipment section, the mechanical team, the plumbing team, the electrical team, and the carpentry shop; daily progress reports for individual projects, construction reports, and semi-monthly reports of stored materials were compiled; regular scheduling meetings were held; and scheduling telephones would be installed. In this way, the construction site of the Beijing Iron and Steel Industry Institute formed a scheduling network and established a scheduling organization. With this scheduling organization, scheduling work can be carried out, and the scheduling role can begin to be played.

The construction work plan is the basis for carrying out scheduling work. Scheduling workers can only work according to the work plan and not according to anything else. Without a work plan, scheduling work loses its working standard; without scheduling work, the realization of the work plan is not guaranteed. The work plan and the scheduling system are inseparable. At the same time as establishing a scheduling system, a construction work plan must be compiled. This is a basic principle. The construction site of the Beijing Iron and Steel Industry Institute compiled a work plan according to this principle. However, the first time the work plan was compiled, it was divorced from reality, which affected the implementation of the scheduling system. The engineering quantities and material requirements in the work plan were very different from the actual situation. On one foundation project, the planned earthwork volume was eighty-six cubic meters, while the actual volume was one hundred and thirty-six cubic meters. It was difficult for the scheduling office to work according to such a plan. In order to support the foundation project, the scheduling office transferred all the concrete workers in the construction site to the second construction site, but it still could not meet the actual needs. It can be seen from this that an inaccurate work plan hinders the progress of scheduling work. The construction site of the Beijing Iron and Steel Industry Institute accepted this lesson and revised the original work plan. However, the second revision of the work plan was delayed for a few days, which also affected the scheduling work. Because of the delay of a few days, the team work plan could not be made out early, and the scheduling personnel did not have a work plan as a basis, so it was not easy to grasp the entire construction situation to carry out scheduling. The accuracy and timeliness of the work plan have such a great effect on the implementation of the scheduling system.

The work plan is certainly the basis for scheduling work, but scheduling workers cannot work with only a work plan; they must also be very familiar with the situation, study the situation, and compare the actual situation with the work plan to discover problems and play a scheduling role. This is the most important condition for implementing the scheduling system. The scheduling office of the Beijing Iron and Steel Industry Institute has learned about some situations and discovered some problems, so it can carry out scheduling work. The scheduling office investigated the material requirements of the second construction site and found that the second construction site lacked formwork and could not pour cement; the scheduling office also learned that the first construction site had some formwork that was not urgently needed, so it transferred these formwork to the second construction site to ensure the needs of the second construction site. If the scheduling office did not know that the second construction site lacked formwork and did not know that the first construction site had formwork that was not urgently needed, then the scheduling office could not flexibly allocate materials and could not realize the role of the scheduler. However, the scheduling personnel of the Beijing Iron and Steel Industry Institute do not have a sufficient understanding of this issue. They did not actively and proactively understand the situation, but emphasized objective difficulties, thinking that "there are not enough people, and the work is passive." This statement is not correct enough. Because the construction site of the Beijing Iron and Steel Industry Institute already has a scheduling network, it can gradually establish a scientific system that is indispensable for scheduling, such as timely reflecting the situation, concentrating the recorded information, reports, and even indicative charts on this basis. If the current conditions are not yet available and experience is lacking, they should also give play to their initiative and patiently and deeply understand more situations. In this way, problems can be foreseen from the comparison of the actual situation and the work plan, and problems can be solved proactively, changing the passive state of work. Otherwise, even if the number of people increases in the future, the work will still be the same passive. At present, because the scheduling office of the Beijing Iron and Steel Industry Institute has not proactively understood the situation, it cannot be as familiar with the dynamics of on-site construction as the back of its hand, and can only rely on the information reflected below to passively solve problems. The cadres below say: "I don't have enough labor here, the scheduling office must quickly think of a solution!" At this time, the scheduling office thinks of a solution and hurriedly transfers labor from other places. If the scheduling office knows in advance what kind of workers a construction site will lack and also knows what kind of workers will be surplus in that place, then the scheduling office can solve this problem as soon as possible. Recently, the steel workers of the second construction site of the construction site stopped work for two days because there was no steel. The scheduling office did not know this situation and could not solve this problem in advance, so it did not avoid this work stoppage accident. This fact shows that it is very important for scheduling personnel to proactively understand the situation and foresee and solve problems.

The engineering scheduling system is an advanced system. Establishing and implementing this system will encounter many ideological obstacles. Without overcoming these obstacles and without resolutely fighting against various incorrect ideas, this system cannot be established and implemented well. In the process of establishing a scheduling system, the construction site of the Beijing Iron and Steel Industry Institute has carried out ideological education, but it is not enough, so that there are still some incorrect ideas among the scheduling personnel and other cadres. Some scheduling personnel were once uneasy about their work, thinking that "doing scheduling work is thankless," and even thinking that "this work is too trivial." This view is wrong. Scheduling work is an indispensable and important work for the construction department. In the past, without scheduling work, the phenomenon of work stoppage waiting for materials, waiting for tools, and waiting for labor was common, which seriously harmed the construction work. Doing a good job in scheduling is not "thankless" or "too trivial," but an important guarantee for changing the chaotic situation in construction management in the past and overcoming waste and no one being responsible. Therefore, scheduling personnel should overcome the mood of uneasiness about work and actively complete this glorious task.

There are also some cadres at the construction site of the Beijing Iron and Steel Industry Institute who do not understand the importance of the scheduling system, do not respect the scheduling personnel, do not obey the scheduling orders, and even refuse to execute the scheduling orders from the perspective of departmental interests. Some cadres used to work in a small unit and are accustomed to decentralized work methods, and are unwilling to accept unified and centralized scheduling command. They often start from the narrow interests of their own unit and want to receive more materials and tools and allocate more labor, always thinking: "As long as my unit is doing well, that's enough." But they do not understand that their over-occupation of materials and labor will hinder the entire project. The second construction site of the construction site once lacked steel, which affected the construction of the concrete project; but the third construction site of the construction site stored more than three tons of steel, which was not used for the time being. The scheduling office of the construction site, starting from the overall situation, decided to transfer the steel from the third construction site to the second construction site, but the cadres of the third construction site refused, refusing to execute this scheduling order with various pretexts. For this reason, the second construction site had to stop work due to lack of steel. This phenomenon shows that departmentalism hinders the implementation of the scheduling system, thereby harming the interests of the whole. This shows that in the process of establishing a scheduling system, this departmentalism must be strictly criticized, so that the prestige of the scheduling personnel can be established and the scheduling system can be implemented. On the other hand, it also shows that the leadership must resolutely support the scheduling and realize the principle that "scheduling orders are the law"; if disorganized and undisciplined behavior is found, it must also be given serious punishment. Of course, scheduling personnel should also act cautiously to ensure that their scheduling orders do not make mistakes. In this way, the phenomenon of harming construction due to errors in scheduling orders can be avoided, and at the same time, the prestige of scheduling work can be truly established among the masses.

    怎样建立和执行工程调度制

    怎样建立和执行工程调度制呢？北京钢铁工业学院工区试行调度制的经验教训，可以答复这个问题。
    执行工程调度制，就是根据作业计划，进行经常的监督和检查，合理地调配劳动力、材料、工具和设备等，防止和消除执行计划中的缺点，来保证作业计划的实现。这就是工程调度制的性质和目的。不了解这个性质和目的，建立工程调度制就要失败。北京钢铁工业学院工区在今年年初曾经成立了调度室，配备了调度员，但是没有发挥调度的作用。当时人们还不了解为什么要建立调度室，把调度室当成了“秘书室”。在调度室内，设立了计划、统计、调度、工务、施工技术等科目，管理了整个工区大大小小的各种工作。总务股要做两个板凳、十块洗衣板，也要调度室批准。调度人员天天批条子、盖章，根本不能做调度工作。在建立责任制运动中，学习了苏联实行工程调度制的经验，明确认识了调度制的性质和目的，改变了机构，把计划、统计、工务等工作划出去，使调度室能够名符其实地做调度工作。在调度室内，配备了调度长、调度员和调度助手；在第一、二、三工地、供应股、劳动组织股、工具设备股、机械队、水暖队、电气队和木工厂配备了调度员；编制了单位工程进度日报、施工报告和库存材料旬报；召开了定期的调度会议；并将设置调度电话。这样，北京钢铁工业学院工区就组成了调度网，建立了调度机构。有了这个调度机构，才能进行调度工作，开始发挥调度的作用。
    施工作业计划是进行调度工作的依据。调度工作者只能根据作业计划而不能根据其他的东西进行工作。没有作业计划，调度工作就失去了工作的标准；没有调度工作，作业计划的实现也就没有了保证。作业计划和调度制是不可分割的。在建立调度制的同时，必须编制施工作业计划。这是一条基本原则。北京钢铁工业学院工区根据这个原则，编制了作业计划。但在第一次编制作业计划时，脱离了实际情况，影响了调度制的实行。作业计划中的工程数量、材料需用量，都和实际情况有很大的出入。在一个基础工程上，计划土方工程量是八十六立方公尺，而实际是一百三十六立方公尺。调度室根据这样的计划，就难以进行工作。调度室为了支援基础工程，曾经把工区内所有的混凝土工，都调到第二工地去，还不能满足实际需要。由此可见：作业计划不准确，对于调度工作的进行是有妨碍的。北京钢铁工业学院工区接受这个教训，修改了原来的作业计划。但在第二次修改作业计划时，又拖延了几天时间，也影响了调度工作。因为拖延了几天时间，班组作业计划便不能及早做出来，调度人员没有作业计划作为根据，就不容易掌握整个施工情况来进行调度。作业计划的准确和及时，对于调度制度的执行就有这样大的作用。
    作业计划固然是调度工作的依据，但是调度工作者仅仅有了作业计划，还不能进行工作；还必须十分熟悉情况，研究情况，以实际情况来和作业计划相对照，才能发现问题，发挥调度的作用。这是贯彻调度制的最重要的条件。北京钢铁工业学院工区调度室曾经了解了一些情况，发现了一些问题，因而才能进行调度工作。调度室曾经调查了第二工地的材料需用的情况，发现第二工地缺少模型板，不能打洋灰；调度室又了解到第一工地还有一些模型板，暂不使用，于是把这些模型板调给第二工地，保证第二工地的需要。如果调度室不了解第二工地缺少模型板的情况，不知道第一工地有着不急用的模型板，那么调度室就不能灵活地调配材料，不能实现调度者的作用。但是，北京钢铁工业学院工区调度人员对于这个问题的认识，还很不够。他们没有积极主动地了解情况，而是强调客观困难，以为
    “人手不够，工作被动”。这种说法是不够正确的。因为北京钢铁工业学院工区已经有了一个调度网，可以在这个基础上逐步建立起及时反映情况、集中情况的记录、报告以至指示图表等为调度所不可少的科学制度来。如果目前条件还不具备，经验缺乏，也应该发挥主动性，耐心地深入地了解更多的情况。这样，才能从实际情况和作业计划的对照中预见问题，主动地解决问题，改变工作的被动状态。否则即使将来人手增多了，工作还会同样的被动。目前北京钢铁工业学院工区调度室因为没有主动地了解情况，所以还不能了如指掌地熟悉现场施工的动态，还只能依靠下面反映的情况来被动地解决问题。下面的干部说：“我这里劳动力不够啦，调度室要赶快想办法呀！”这时候，调度室才想办法，急忙从别的地方去调拨劳动力。如果调度室预先了解情况，知道那个工地将要缺少什么样的工人，也知道那个地方将要多余什么样的工人，那么调度室就可以及早地解决这个问题。最近该工区第二工地钢筋工人，因为没有钢筋，停工两天。调度室不知道这个情况，不能够预先解决这个问题，因而没有避免这个停工事故。这个事实，说明调度人员主动地了解情况，预见地解决问题，是十分重要的。
    工程调度制是一个先进的制度。建立和执行这个制度，会碰到许多思想障碍。不克服这些障碍，不坚决地向各种不正确的思想作斗争，就不能很好地建立和执行这个制度。北京钢铁工业学院工区在建立调度制度的过程中，虽然进行了思想教育，但还不够，以致在调度人员和其他干部中，还有着一些不正确的思想。有些调度人员曾经不安心工作，以为“干调度工作，吃力不讨好”，甚至认为“这个工作太琐碎了”。这种看法是不对的。调度工作是施工部门不可缺少的重要工作。过去没有调度工作，曾经普遍地发生过停工待料、待工具、待劳动力的现象，严重地危害了施工工作。做好调度工作，不是“吃力不讨好”，不是“太琐碎了”，而是改变过去施工管理上的混乱情况，克服浪费和无人负责现象的重要保证。因之调度人员应该克服不安心工作的情绪，积极地完成这个光荣任务。
    北京钢铁工业学院工区还有一些干部，他们不了解调度制度的重要性，不尊重调度人员，不服从调度命令，甚至从本位的利益出发，拒绝执行调度命令。有些干部过去在一个小单位内工作，习惯于分散的工作方法，不愿意接受统一的集中的调度指挥。他们往往从本单位的狭小的利益出发，想要多领到一些材料和工具，多分配到一些劳动力，总觉得：“只要我这个单位工作好就行了。”但他们不了解他们多占领了材料和劳动力，就会妨害整个工程。该工区第二工地曾经缺少钢筋，影响混凝土工程的施工；但该工区第三工地存放了三吨多钢筋，暂时不用。该工区调度室从全局出发，决定把第三工地的钢筋调给第二工地，第三工地的干部却不肯，以各种藉口拒绝执行这个调度命令。由于这个原因，第二工地就为缺少钢筋而不得不停工。这种现象，说明本位主义思想妨害调度制的执行，从而危害了整体的利益。这说明了：在建立调度制的过程中，必须严格地批判这种本位主义思想，这样才能建立调度人员的威信，贯彻调度制度。另一方面也说明了：领导方面必须坚决地支持调度，实现“调度命令就是法律”的原则；如果发现了无组织无纪律的行为，也必须给以严肃的处分。当然，调度人员也应该慎重行事，务使自己的调度命令不发生错误。这样，才可以避免因为调度命令的错误而危害施工的现象，同时才可以使调度工作的威望在群众中真正建立起来。
