He said: Under the correct leadership of the great leader Chairman Mao, the Communist Party of China, and the Central People's Government, the Tibetan people have returned to the prosperous and strong family of the motherland and enjoy equal and free rights. He then pointed out: After the troops of the Chinese People's Liberation Army entered Tibet, they overcame all difficulties, established schools and opened up wasteland for production, and did many things beneficial to the Tibetan people. We Tibetan youth must actively work hard to thoroughly implement the agreement on the peaceful liberation of Tibet, and strive to consolidate the southwest border of the motherland and lead Tibet to prosperity and happiness!

    Lu Qian, a young teacher from Tsinghua University and a representative of the "Rapid Reading Method for Russian Professional Books" creation group, vividly introduced the process of their creation of the "Rapid Reading Method for Russian Professional Books."

Our industrial and commercial circles must actively participate in this construction under the unified planning leadership of the People's Government and the state-owned economy. Our young industrialists and businessmen should play a more active role and strive to manage economic undertakings that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood.

    The speeches of the foreign guests were warmly welcomed by the entire audience. Ya. Hejna, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Youth League, paid tribute to the Chinese youth on behalf of the Czechoslovak youth. He said: Czechoslovak youth are very familiar with the patriotic achievements of Chinese youth and the great achievements Chinese youth have made in industry, agriculture, water conservancy, learning, and other aspects.

Youth in both urban and rural areas of Indonesia know about the great achievements of the Chinese people and Chinese youth in resisting America and aiding Korea and in national construction. What Chinese youth have already achieved and are enjoying today is an encouragement and an ideal for Indonesian youth. Sukatno described the plight of Indonesian youth under imperialist oppression and their heroic struggles, and he expressed his gratitude for the friendship of Chinese youth to Indonesian youth. Sukatno presented the congress with a red banner inscribed with the words "Chinese and Indonesian Youth Unite for Peace" and solemnly presented the congress with an Indonesian national hat.

    Ya. Balcheszak, Secretary of the Central Council of the Polish Youth League, warmly praised the various achievements of the Chinese and Polish peoples and youth in national construction.

Balcheszak presented the congress with four small statues wearing Polish national costumes and two sets of records.

    Gonjadorj, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Mongolian Revolutionary Youth League, told the congress that Mongolian youth are closely watching every success of Chinese youth and share the happiness and pride of Chinese youth. Gonjadorj presented the congress with a red banner.

    I. Hall, Vice Chairman of the British Communist Youth League, said: Many British people and youth are watching with great interest the amazing progress of China since its liberation. She pointed out: Chinese youth are carrying out peaceful construction with confident smiles, which is in stark contrast to the bleak lives of British youth tied to the war chariot of American imperialism. However, a large number of British youth are already fighting for lasting peace, national independence and better living conditions. They also demand an end to the Korean War, increased friendship between the Chinese and British people, and promotion of Sino-British trade. Hall promised to introduce the happy life of Chinese youth to British youth.
