Xinhua News Agency, Paris, June 24th: Following André Marie, Antoine Bidault's efforts to form a cabinet have again failed. Today marks the thirty-fifth day that France has been without a government, reaching a post-war record for the duration of the crisis.

After the successive failures of Reynaud, Mendès-France, and Pildur and Marie to form a cabinet, French President Auriol specifically convened a meeting of all former prime ministers and leaders of all parties, excluding only the Communist Party. Under the leadership of Reynaud, they jointly agreed on a so-called "minimum program" as the basis for an agreement among the various right-wing parties, in order to cobble together a parliamentary majority. This "minimum program" stipulated: granting the government special powers to deal with the financial situation; "reforming" the tax system; increasing the Bank of France's advances to the government, with the nation's "new income" as collateral. The "minimum program" vaguely discussed "stimulating the economy," "guaranteeing full employment," and "building houses," and advocated that the government could force workers to accept "arbitration" in the event of conflicts between workers and capitalists. The "minimum program" also specifically mentioned that the newly formed government should raise the issue of Indochina at the upcoming Bermuda conference of the United States, Britain, and France, and should "protect French interests." The "minimum program" demanded an expansion of government power and advocated "accelerating the discussion of various bills regarding constitutional amendments," especially those concerning the dissolution of the National Assembly in the event of a government crisis. "L'Humanité" pointed out that the repeated government crises were not due to the constitution, but to the growing dissatisfaction of the working class and other strata of the people with the government's policies.

After the "minimum program" was set, Auriol invited former Prime Minister Bidault to form a cabinet on the 21st. Bidault was the prime minister of the government before the fall of the Mayer government, and was notorious for his conspiracy to frame the Communist Party and the failure of his so-called "franc-saving" "experiment." On the evening of the 23rd, Bidault told the president that he could not obtain the necessary majority in parliament and therefore could not accept the task of forming a cabinet.

Amidst the government crisis, the emptiness of the French treasury has become even more critical. On the same day as Bidault's failure, the National Assembly authorized Mayer's "caretaker cabinet" to borrow 50 billion francs from the Bank of France to pay off debts due at the end of the month. In addition, the parliament approved a third extension for the treasury to repay the 80 billion franc advance requested from the Bank of France in March, before Mayer went to the United States.

### 比内的组阁活动又告失败  法国政府危机仍然无法解决

    比内的组阁活动又告失败
    法国政府危机仍然无法解决
   【新华社二十四日讯】巴黎消息：继安德烈·马里之后，安多瓦纳·比内的组阁活动又告失败。到今天，法国已经有三十五天没有政府了，危机的持久达到战后的最高纪录。
    在雷诺、孟戴斯—弗朗斯、皮杜尔及马里先后组阁失败后，法国总统阿里奥尔曾特地召集各前任总理及所有党派领袖会议，单单排除了共产党，而由雷诺领导共同商定了一个所谓“最低纲领”，作为各右翼党派协议的基础，以便凑成一个议会多数。这个“最低纲领”规定：给予政府以特权以便应付财政情况；“改革”税制；增加法兰西银行对政府的垫款，而用国家的“新收入”作垫款担保。“最低纲领”空谈“刺激经济”、“保证充分就业”以及“建筑房屋”，并主张在工人和资本家发生冲突时政府可以强迫工人接受“仲裁”。“最低纲领”还特别提到，新组成的政府应在美英法三国即将举行的百慕大会议上提出印度支那问题，并要“保护法国利益”。“最低纲领”要求扩大政府权力，主张“加速讨论关于修改宪法的各种法案”，特别是关于发生政府危机时解散国民议会的法案。“人道报”指出：政府一再发生危机，不是因为宪法，而是因为工人阶级和其他阶层人民对政府的政策日益不满。
    “最低纲领”定出后，阿里奥尔就在二十一日邀请前任总理比内组阁。比内就是在迈耶政府前倒台的那个政府总理，因诬陷共产党的阴谋和所谓“挽救法郎”的“试验”破产而声名狼藉。二十三日晚，比内告诉总统，他不能够在议会中获得必要的多数，因此无法接受组阁任务。
    在政府危机中，法国国库空虚的情况已经更加危急。在比内失败的同一天，国民议会授权迈耶的“看守内阁”向法兰西银行借款五百亿法郎，以便偿付月底应付的款项。此外，议会又批准国库第三次延期偿还三月间迈耶赴美前夕向法兰西银行要求的八百亿法郎垫款。
