    Poor Planning in Textbook Publishing Increases Burden on Some Students

    Sun Fuqing of the Textbook Section of the Xinhua Bookstore Hunan Branch writes: The work of publishing textbooks by the People's Education Publishing House lacks planning, resulting in waste. The publishing house bound the textbooks for both semesters of the sixth grade of senior primary school for the spring of 1953 into one volume. However, the Central Ministry of Education has stipulated that all primary schools will switch to autumn enrollment starting this autumn, and the original spring enrollment classes will be incorporated into the autumn classes. As a result, there will be no students reading the second half of the sixth-grade textbook next semester. In addition, according to the "1953 Spring Inventory Disposal Situation Table" issued by the publishing house, three textbooks used in the sixth grade—arithmetic, geography, and natural science—will be discontinued in the autumn (Chinese language will continue to be used in the autumn, and history will be used in the autumn after adding a errata sheet). Thus, the three discontinued textbooks cannot be used in the autumn and will become waste paper. This is a huge loss. In Hunan Province alone, a total of 97,000 sets of arithmetic, geography, and natural science textbooks for the sixth grade have been sold, with a total value of over 400 million yuan. Half of them will be discarded without being used, resulting in a loss of over 200 million yuan. Of course, the decision to discontinue some textbooks may not have been foreseeable in advance, but if the textbooks had been bound in separate volumes, this loss could have been avoided.

    教科书出版工作计划不周增加了一部分学生的负担
    新华书店湖南分店课本股孙富卿来信：人民教育出版社出版教科书的工作缺乏计划，以致造成浪费。该社将一九五三年春季高级小学六年级两学期用的课本订成一册出版。但中央教育部规定今秋起小学一律改为秋季始业，原有春季始业班次都将编入秋季班。这样，下学期就没有读六年级下半册课本的学生了。此外，根据该社发下的一九五三年春季存书处理情况表，六年级用的课本中，算术、地理、自然三种教科书在秋季要停用（国语在秋季照用，历史在秋季加勘表后照用）。这样，其中停用的三种课本秋季便不能采用，而将成为废纸。这是一个巨大的损失，只就湖南一省来说，已经卖出的六年级用的算术、地理、自然三种教科书共九万七千套，总值四亿多元，其中一半没有用就作废了，计损失二亿元以上。当然，停用一部分教科书的决定可能事先不能估计到，但假如课本是分册装订的话，这个损失是可以避免的。
