    The World Women's Congress, decided upon by the Women's International Democratic Federation, opened on June 5th in Copenhagen, the capital of Denmark. Women representatives from all over the world will discuss important issues related to women's vital interests at this conference. Their slogan is: "Defend women's rights, women act to protect children and peace!" Women and mothers of all countries, recognizing the significant responsibility they bear for human society, will issue their solemn call at this conference. This conference will help enhance mutual understanding, friendship, and unity among women of all countries, further expand the international united front to defend world peace and protect the rights of women and children, and make new contributions to maintaining peace and striving for the rights of women and children. This is a major development in the international democratic women's movement.
    Today, only women in the Soviet Union, China, and the various People's Democratic countries have achieved genuine liberation on a global scale. They enjoy equal rights with men in political, economic, cultural, and all social aspects of life. In particular, Soviet women, inspired by the ideology of the Party of Lenin and Stalin, are playing a huge role in strengthening the socialist state and in the cause of Soviet communist construction. They actively participate in state management and are engaged in national construction in industry, agriculture, transportation, and cultural and educational sectors. Soviet mothers and children receive special care and attention from the government; last year alone, the state spent 6,355.5 million rubles to subsidize mothers and children. The number of nurseries, kindergartens, and children's homes is rapidly increasing, and all school-age children are able to attend school. Due to the continuous improvement of the living standards of the Soviet people and the development of public health, the average indicators of physical development of Soviet children have been further improved. Women in the People's Democratic countries are emulating the example of Soviet women, actively participating in the work of building a new life in order to defend peace and further improve their own and their children's living conditions, and have achieved remarkable results. Only women in capitalist countries, colonies, and dependent countries are in a completely different situation. There, military budgets are swelling, the tax burden on the people is increasing, prices are rising day by day, peaceful production is shrinking, and unemployment is increasing dramatically. These disasters and the pain of poverty fall first on the working women and children of these countries. Many women in many capitalist countries do not even have formal suffrage, and in general the suffrage of working women in these countries is severely restricted. As for the colonies and dependent countries, under the dual oppression and plunder of foreign imperialism and feudal forces, working women are fundamentally deprived of all rights. In almost all capitalist countries, the phenomenon of unequal pay for equal work between men and women is serious, the interests of women are generally neglected, and children are subjected to all kinds of torture and poisoning, becoming objects of cheap exploitation and enslavement. Driven by hunger, many children in the United States begin to sell their labor from the age of six or seven. In countries such as the United States, Japan, and the Philippines, the crime of child trafficking is openly prevalent. All this shows that in capitalist countries, colonies, and dependent countries, the most basic rights to survival of the vast numbers of working women and children are seriously threatened. The inclusion of the struggle for and defense of the rights of women and children as the primary item on the agenda of this World Women's Congress is based on these actual circumstances.
    Now, the vast numbers of women in these capitalist countries, colonies, and dependent countries are becoming increasingly aware, and they are resolutely rising up to fight for and defend their due rights, and for and defend the rights of their children to survival, health, and education. Their struggle is entirely just and has won the sympathy and support of all progressive people in the world. This World Women's Congress will, under this just sympathy and support, multiply the mutual support among women of all countries, unite the strength of all women of all countries, unite the masses of women in the capitalist camp and in the socialist and peace-loving democratic camp, be confident that different social systems can coexist peacefully, and thus enable women all over the world to further closely link the struggle for women's rights and the protection of women and children with the struggle to defend world peace and democracy. Women in the Soviet Union, our country, and the People's Democratic countries, should further strengthen the power of the peace and democracy camp through creative labor. In Korea and Vietnam, women, together with the people of the whole country, are heroically and tenaciously fighting against foreign aggressors, and they have made amazing contributions to the cause of world peace. In various capitalist countries, colonies, and dependent countries, women have also actively participated in the struggle to defend peace and oppose the threat of war. They have played a great role in the signature campaign for the conclusion of the Five-Power Peace Pact. They have taken practical actions to demand an end to the Korean War, to stop the shipment of munitions to Vietnam and Malaya to carry out massacres, to oppose the rearmament of Japan and West Germany, and to oppose the policy of arms expansion and war preparation. These courageous actions of theirs to defend peace and democracy have won universal praise from the people of the world. They resolutely demand an immediate end to all wars, the easing of international tensions, and the peaceful settlement of all international disputes through consultation. This huge call is having an increasingly powerful echo in international life.
    The movement of women of all countries to strive for democracy, under the banner of the Women's International Democratic Federation, has obviously become an important part of the world people's movement to defend peace. Around the Women's International Democratic Federation, 135 million organized women in 65 countries have already united. The convening of this World Women's Congress further marks the unprecedented development and a new upsurge in the world women's movement. Nearly 1,000 representatives from 85 countries are participating in this conference, and the participating representatives include women of different nationalities, different political views, different religious beliefs, different lifestyles, and different classes and occupations from various countries; as long as they hope for peace and advocate the protection of the rights of women and children, they can be invited to participate. This more fully demonstrates that this conference truly represents the interests and aspirations of women in various countries of the world.
    Chinese women and the Chinese people, under the patriotic and internationalist education of Chairman Mao Zedong and the Chinese Communist Party, deeply understand that the cause of building the motherland and defending world peace are two inseparable glorious tasks. Chinese women have dispatched their own delegation to attend this World Women's Congress, will strengthen ties with women from all over the world, and actively strive for international peace and friendship. The vast number of women in our country are loyal friends of all peace-loving women in the world and will guarantee to faithfully implement the resolutions of the World Women's Congress, unite with all peace-loving women in the world, and jointly strive for international peace and the rights and happiness of women and children.

    世界妇女运动的强大发展
    国际民主妇女联合会决定召开的世界妇女大会，六月五日在丹麦首都哥本哈根开幕了。来自世界各国的妇女代表们，要在这次大会上讨论各项有关妇女切身利益的重大问题。她们的口号是：“保卫妇女权利，妇女们行动起来保卫儿童与和平！”各国的妇女和母亲们认识到自己对于人类社会所负的重大责任，将在这次大会上发出她们庄严的呼声。这个大会将有助于增进各国妇女间的相互了解、友谊和团结，进一步扩大保卫世界和平、保卫妇女儿童权利的国际妇女统一战线，并为维护和平与争取妇女儿童的权利而作出新的贡献。这是国际民主妇女运动的一个重大发展。
    今天，在全世界范围内，还只有苏联、中国和各人民民主国家的妇女得到了真正的解放。她们在政治上、经济上、文化上和一切社会生活中得到了和男子同等的权利。特别是苏联妇女，她们在列宁和斯大林党的思想鼓舞下，正为加强社会主义国家的力量，为苏联共产主义建设事业发挥着巨大的作用。她们积极地参加了国家的管理工作，在工业、农业、运输业以及文化教育部门中从事国家的建设工作。苏联的母亲和儿童们受到政府的特别关怀和照顾，国家仅在去年就支出了六十三亿五千五百万卢布来补助母亲和儿童。托儿所、幼儿园和儿童之家的数目正迅速增加，一切学龄儿童都能够入学。由于苏联人民生活水平的不断提高和公共卫生事业的发展，苏联儿童身体发育的平均指标有了更进一步的提高。各人民民主国家的妇女正效法苏联妇女的榜样，为保卫和平，为争取自身和儿童生活条件的进一步改善，积极地参加建设新生活的工作，并且得到了显著的成绩。只有资本主义国家、殖民地和附属国的妇女则处在完全不同的情况下。在那里，军事预算正在膨胀，人民的捐税负担正在增加，物价一天天上涨，和平生产日益缩减，失业人数急剧增加。这些灾难和贫穷的痛苦，首先落在这些国家的劳动妇女和儿童身上。许多资本主义国家里的许多妇女，有的连形式上的选举权也是没有的，一般地这些国家的劳动妇女的选举权受到了极大的限制。至于在殖民地和附属国内，在外国帝国主义和封建势力的双重压迫和掠夺下，劳动妇女根本被剥夺了一切权利。几乎在所有资本主义国家，男女工人同工不同酬的现象都严重存在，妇女的利益普遍遭受漠视，儿童遭受着百般摧残与毒害，成为廉价的剥削和奴役的对象。在饥饿的驱使下，美国许多儿童从六七岁开始就要出卖自己的劳动力。在美国、日本、菲律宾等国家里，贩卖儿童的罪行公开流行。这些都说明，在资本主义国家、殖民地和附属国里，广大劳动妇女和儿童连最起码的生存权利都受到了严重威胁。在这次世界妇女大会的议程中，把争取与保卫妇女儿童权利放在首要的地位，就是根据这些实际情况出发的。
    现在，这些资本主义国家、殖民地、附属国的广大妇女正在日益觉悟起来，她们坚决地奋起为争取和保卫她们自己应有的权利，为争取和保卫她们的孩子们的生存、健康和受教育的权利而斗争。她们的这种斗争完全是正义的，已经赢得全世界一切进步人类的同情和支持。世界妇女大会就将在这正义的同情和支持之下，百倍地增进各国妇女间的互相支持，团结起各国一切妇女的力量，团结起资本主义阵营各国和社会主义与和平民主阵营各国的妇女群众，确信不同的社会制度是能够和平共处的，因而使全世界妇女一致地把争取妇女的权利及保卫妇女儿童的斗争，和保卫世界和平民主的斗争进一步地密切联系起来。苏联、我国和各人民民主国家的妇女，要进一步用创造性的劳动，来增强和平民主阵营的力量。在朝鲜和越南，妇女和全国人民一道，英勇顽强地打击着外国侵略军，她们对世界保卫和平的事业作了惊人的贡献。在各资本主义国家、殖民地和附属国，妇女们也积极地参加了保卫和平、反对战争威胁的斗争。她们在争取缔结五大国和平公约的签名运动中起了很大的作用。她们以实际行动要求停止朝鲜战争，阻止运送军火到越南、马来亚去进行屠杀，反对重新武装日本和西德，反对扩军备战政策。她们为保卫和平民主的这些勇敢的行动，获得了全世界人民的普遍赞扬。她们坚决地要求立即停止一切战争，缓和国际紧张的局势，用协商办法和平解决一切国际纠纷。这一巨大的呼声正在国际生活中发生日益有力的回响。
    以国际民主妇女联合会为旗帜的各国妇女争取民主的运动，显然已经成为世界人民保卫和平运动的重要的一部分。在国际民主妇女联合会的周围，已经团结起六十五个国家的一亿三千五百万有组织的妇女。这次世界妇女大会的召开，更标志着世界妇女运动的空前发展和新的高涨。参加这次大会的有八十五个国家将近一千名代表，而与会代表中更包括着各国不同民族、不同政治见解、不同宗教信仰、不同生活方式、不同阶层和职业的妇女；只要她们希望和平，主张保护妇女儿童权利，就可以应邀参加。这更充分地显示了这个大会真正代表着世界各个不同国家妇女的利益和愿望。
    中国妇女和中国人民受着毛泽东主席和中国共产党的爱国主义与国际主义的教育，深切地懂得建设祖国与保卫世界和平的事业是两个不可分割的光荣任务。中国妇女已经派遣了自己的代表团出席这次世界妇女大会，将和世界各国的妇女加强联系，积极地为争取国际和平和友谊而努力。我国的广大妇女是世界一切爱好和平的妇女的忠实的朋友，将保证忠实地执行世界妇女大会的决议，与世界一切爱好和平的妇女团结一致，共同为争取国际和平和妇女儿童的权利和幸福而斗争。
