The Guangdong-Guangxi Salt Affairs Bureau began converting salt fields in the autumn of 1951 in some backward small salt regions with high salt production costs, low quality, difficult transportation, dispersed sites, difficult management, and no prospects for development. By the end of 1952, it had eliminated salt fields and stoves with an annual production capacity of over 1.7 million dan (approximately 85,000 metric tons) of small salt, and converted approximately 92,300 salt workers, salt farmers, and their families to other occupations. A total of 6.27595 billion yuan was issued as subsidies and loans to help salt farmers with their conversion. Eliminating backward small salt fields was originally a correct measure to improve the lives of salt farmers and balance production and sales. However, in carrying out the work of converting salt fields, the Guangdong-Guangxi Salt Affairs Bureau only one-sidedly emphasized that backward small salt regions in Guangdong and Guangxi must be eliminated, while neglecting whether there were conditions to solve the livelihood difficulties of salt farmers after conversion. It adopted a very careless approach. The bureau did not conduct investigations and research, and blindly believed that as long as the opportunity of land reform was used to allow salt farmers to receive the same share of land as farmers, the problem could be solved. They completely failed to estimate conditions such as the scarcity of land in coastal areas, the fact that 70 percent of people in salt regions rely on salt production for their livelihoods, and that land reform could not completely solve the livelihood problems of salt farmers after conversion. According to statistics from the Chao-Shan salt fields, converted salt farmers could only receive land that produced an average of 250 jin (approximately 125 kg) of grain per person per year, and some could only receive land that produced 92 jin (approximately 46 kg) of grain per year. Moreover, according to the policy of "whoever plants it harvests it," only 37.5 percent of the rent grain could be obtained after the autumn harvest of that year, and they could not reclaim the land for self-cultivation until the following spring, with harvests in June and July. At the same time, the conversion subsidies for salt farmers were limited, there was no way out for surplus labor, and there was a lack of agricultural production materials (in Hepu, Guangxi, sometimes 20 or 30 people shared one ox, and 20 people shared one plow). Therefore, their lives were very difficult after conversion and could not be sustained for long.

The Guangdong-Guangxi Salt Affairs Bureau did not proceed from actual conditions and simply pursued the number of salt fields eliminated. This fueled the phenomenon of lower-level salt affairs personnel issuing mandatory orders and violating laws and regulations. Cadres in Tiansha Salt Field in Suixi County, in order to complete the task of elimination as quickly as possible, one-sidedly emphasized that salt farmers should sacrifice their personal interests. Wang Xi, a cadre in the Fulu team in Hepu County, Guangxi, told salt farmers: "The elimination is an order. You have to eliminate it even if you don't want to. If you resist, we will detain you." Some cadres even deceived salt farmers, exaggerating the benefits of conversion, saying, "Throw away the broken rice bowl and get a golden rice bowl." Although most of the salt farmers in various places temporarily eliminated the salt fields, they complained afterwards because they had no means of living. In Huilai, Raoping, and other places, many salt farmers went to the cadres' homes with rice bags to beg for food, making many cadres afraid to go home.

The Guangdong Provincial Salt Industry Company did not carefully consider the problem of salt production and sales, and the sales plan it compiled was unreasonable. Therefore, in the areas where salt fields had been eliminated, there was a serious shortage of salt sales. In January and February, about 1,000 to 2,000 people lined up to buy salt in Shantou every day. Later, the policy of limiting purchases was implemented, reducing the limit from 500 jin to 30 jin. In Shantou, Jiangmen, and other places, some farmers could not buy salt even after waiting for several days, and speculative merchants took the opportunity to raise salt prices from the original 1,000 yuan per jin to 4,000 yuan. In the Qinzhou area of Guangxi, salt farmers had to exchange two jin of rice for one jin of salt, and they had to travel dozens of miles to buy one jin of salt. Due to the shortage of salt, most of the salt farmers in the eliminated areas started to cook illegal salt. Salt farmers in Nankang District, Hepu, Guangxi, told comrades from the salt affairs station: "We have a golden mountain but no money to use. No matter what you say, we will cook illegal salt." Salt farmers in Xianchun Township, Raoping, had repeatedly asked the district and county governments to resume salt production, but received no response. They even wanted to fight against the land reform cadres. The social order in the small salt regions was in a very chaotic state.

In order to correct the above-mentioned errors in the work of converting salt fields and solve the problem of livelihood difficulties for converted salt farmers, the CCP Central Committee South China Sub-bureau issued instructions in March of this year on handling the production and livelihood problems of converted salt farmers. It was permitted to organize converted salt farmers with very little land allocated in land reform or who could not maintain their lives at all to resume salt production under leadership and in an organized manner. The amount of salt production to be resumed depended on the amount of land allocated, the amount of production, and the supply and demand of salt. Those salt farmers who had been converted and could maintain their lives by relying on the land allocated in the land reform, and whose agricultural tool problems had been solved, generally would no longer resume salt production. However, immediate and effective assistance should be provided to those who are currently experiencing livelihood difficulties. In areas where salt production has been resumed independently, the local government should call on salt farmers to register and review and handle the matter according to their living conditions.

Currently, 58 percent of the eliminated salt fields in the eastern Guangdong region have been organized to resume salt production. The western Guangdong region and the Guangxi salt field region have also made preliminary plans to organize the resumption of salt production. In other regions, in addition to providing emergency relief, preparations are also being made to solve the current livelihood difficulties and future livelihood prospects of converted salt farmers through measures such as building water conservancy projects, providing production loans, and providing living subsidies. The relevant responsible personnel of the Guangdong-Guangxi Salt Affairs Bureau are being dealt with by the CCP Central Committee South China Sub-bureau and other leading organs.

    两广盐务管理局
    以轻率办法进行废场转业工作造成恶果
    中共中央华南分局已经进行检查处理
    两广盐务管理局从一九五一年秋开始，在部分产盐成本高、质量低、运输困难、场地分散、不易管理、没有发展前途的落后小盐区，进行废场转业工作。到一九五二年底，裁废了每年能产小盐一百七十多万担的盐田和盐灶，转业盐工、盐民和家属约有九万二千三百多人。为帮助盐民转业而发放的补助费以及各项贷款计六十二亿七千五百九十五万元。裁废落后小盐场，原为改善盐民生活，平衡产销的正确措施。但是，两广盐务管理局在进行废场转业工作中，只片面强调两广落后小盐区必须裁废，而忽视了有没有条件解决盐民转业后的生活困难的问题，竟采取了十分轻率的办法。该局不进行调查研究，盲目地认为只要利用土地改革的机会，使盐民分得与农民同等的一份土地，就可以解决问题了。他们完全没有估计到沿海地区土地少，目前盐区人民百分之七十要靠晒盐生活，土地改革不能完全解决盐民转业后的生活问题等条件。据潮汕盐场的统计，转业盐民平均每人只能分到年产二百五十斤粮的田，少的只能分到年产九十二斤粮的田，并且所分到的田，依照“谁种谁收”的政策，在当年秋收后仅能得到百分之三十七点五的租谷，要到第二年春才可以收回自耕，六、七月才有收获。同时，盐民转业补助费有限，剩余劳动力没有出路，又缺乏农业生产资料（广西省合浦盐民，有的二、三十人才分有一条耕牛，二十人才有一付犁耙），因此，他们转业后生活很困难，无法长期维持。
    两广盐务管理局不从实际情况出发，单纯追求裁废盐场的数字，这就助长了下级盐务工作人员强迫命令、违法乱纪的现象。遂溪县恬沙盐场干部为了赶快完成裁废任务，片面强调盐民应牺牲个人利益。广西合浦县福禄组干部王禧对盐民说：“裁废是命令，不愿意裁也得裁，如果你们抵抗，就把你们扣起来。”有的干部甚至欺骗盐民，夸大转业的好处，说什么“丢掉破饭碗，换来金饭碗”。各地大多数的盐民虽然暂时把盐场裁废了，过后因生活无着，就埋怨起来了。惠来、饶平等地，许多盐民拿着米袋到干部家里要饭吃，弄得许多干部不敢回家。
    广东省盐业公司没有很好地考虑食盐产销问题，编造的销售计划是不合理的，因此，在已裁废盐场的地区，就发生了食盐脱售的严重情况。一、二月间，汕头市每天约有一、二千人排队购盐，后来实行限购，由限购五百斤降低到限购三十斤。汕头、江门等地有的农民等几天也买不到盐，投机私商就乘机抬高盐价，由原来的每斤一千多元抬高到四千元。广西钦州一带盐民要以两斤米换一斤盐，并且买一斤盐要跑几十里路。由于食盐供不应求，大部分废场地区的盐民，就纷纷煮起私盐来。广西合浦南康区盐民对盐务所同志说：“靠着金山无钱用，你说什么我们也要煮私盐。”饶平仙春乡盐民曾先后到区政府和县政府要求复晒，都没有得到答复，他们竟要斗争土地改革工作干部。小盐区的社会秩序处于十分混乱的状态。
    中共中央华南分局为了纠正上述废场转业工作中的错误，解决转业盐民生活困难的问题，曾于今年三月发出关于处理转业盐民生产生活问题的指示。准许在土地改革中分得土地很少、根本不能维持生活的转业盐民，有领导、有组织地进行复晒。复晒多少视分得土地的多寡和产量的多少，以及盐的供销情况而定。凡已转业的盐民，依靠土地改革中分得的土地可以维持生活，且农具问题已经解决者，一般不再复晒。但对目前生活有困难者，应立即切实帮助解决。已自行复晒的地区，当地政府要号召盐民登记，并根据其生活状况，审查处理。
    现在粤东区被裁废的盐场，已有百分之五十八组织复晒。粤西区和广西盐场区也已作出初步组织复晒的计划。其余地区，除进行紧急救济外，并准备通过兴修水利、生产贷款、生活补助等办法，解决转业盐民目前的生活困难及今后生活出路。对于两广盐务管理局的有关责任人员，中共中央华南分局等领导机关正在处理中。（本报广东记者站）
