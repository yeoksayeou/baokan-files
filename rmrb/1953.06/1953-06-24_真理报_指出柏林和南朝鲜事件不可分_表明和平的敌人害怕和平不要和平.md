Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, June 23rd - "Pravda" published an editorial on June 23rd entitled "The Bankruptcy of the Adventurous Actions of Foreign Mercenaries in Berlin," pointing out that the adventurous actions of foreign mercenaries in Berlin and the provocations of the Syngman Rhee gang in South Korea are inextricably linked.

The editorial pointed out: This is a criminal conspiracy by the enemies of peace and reactionary groups, who fear peace, do not want peace, and try their best to prevent the easing of international tensions. The editorial said: It is no accident that the adventurous actions of the fascist conspirators in Berlin and the adventurous actions of Syngman Rhee in Korea took place precisely when there were signs of easing international tensions due to the policies of peace-loving forces. The editorial said: The Panmunjom negotiations resulted in the signing of an agreement on the repatriation of prisoners of war. A Korean armistice could have become a reality in the next few days. However, a Korean ceasefire does not suit the enemies of peace who gamble on war. In order to obstruct the signing of the Korean armistice agreement, these extremists have taken criminal provocative actions. Wide public opinion around the world rightly comments that the provocative actions of the Syngman Rhee gang are a direct attempt to undermine the conclusion of the Korean armistice agreement. The editorial said: It is not difficult to understand that the provocations in Berlin and South Korea are pursuing the same goal - to hinder the growing peace forces from easing international tensions, and at the same time to launch reactionary forces, forces of war. The editorial said: The Berlin and South Korean incidents show that the enemies of peace have not stopped using the most extreme means to obstruct the easing of international tensions and to undermine the cause of strengthening cooperation among the people of all countries. At the same time, these incidents show that the strength of the people who are fighting for peace is growing and consolidating, and countering the conspiracies of the enemies of peace. The adventurous actions of foreign mercenaries in Berlin have suffered bankruptcy. The unity and organization of the peace-loving forces, and the consistency of their actions, are a guarantee that the provocative actions of the Syngman Rhee gang and their protectors will also suffer bankruptcy. The editorial concluded: All those who value the cause of peace will draw the necessary conclusions from these events, will tirelessly increase their vigilance, expose the conspiracies of reactionary groups, and will further strengthen the struggle to protect and consolidate peace.

    “真理报”指出柏林和南朝鲜事件不可分
    表明和平的敌人害怕和平不要和平
    【新华社莫斯科二十三日电】“真理报”二十三日以“外国雇佣分子在柏林冒险行动的破产”为题发表社论，指出外国雇佣分子在柏林的冒险行动和李承晚匪帮在南朝鲜的挑衅行动，是彼此不可分地联系着的。
    社论指出：这是和平的敌人、反动集团的罪恶阴谋，他们害怕和平，不要和平，竭力不让国际紧张局势缓和下来。社论说：法西斯阴谋分子在柏林的冒险行动和李承晚在朝鲜的冒险行动，恰好在由于爱好和平的力量的政策而出现了国际紧张局势缓和的标志的时候进行，不是偶然的。社论说：板门店谈判的结果，签订了遣返战俘协议。朝鲜停战本来在最近几天就可能成为现实了。然而朝鲜停火并不适合以战争为赌注的和平之敌的心意。为了阻碍朝鲜停战协定的签订，这些极端分子采取罪恶的挑衅行动。全世界广泛的舆论界正当地评论李承晚匪帮这个挑衅行动是直接企图破坏朝鲜停战协定的缔结。社论说：不难了解，在柏林和在南朝鲜的挑衅行动追求着同一目的——阻碍日益增长的和平力量取得缓和国际紧张局势，同时发动反动力量、战争力量。社论说：柏林和南朝鲜事件说明，和平的敌人没有停止采用最极端手段，以阻碍国际紧张局势的缓和，以破坏各国人民加强合作的事业。同时这些事件说明，为和平而斗争的人民的力量增长和巩固着，给和平的敌人的阴谋以反击。外国雇佣分子在柏林的冒险行动遭受了破产。爱好和平的力量的团结和有组织，他们行动的一致，是使李承晚匪帮及其庇护者的挑衅行动也遭受破产的保证。社论最后说：一切重视和平事业的人们，将从这些事件中作出必要的结论，将不倦地提高警惕性，揭发反动集团的阴谋，将更加加强为保护和巩固和平的斗争。
