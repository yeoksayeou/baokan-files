Soviet Linguistics Doctor Fedlin Writes Article in Memory of Qu Yuan
Moscow Summer Park Hosts Reading of Works by Chinese Writers
(Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 16th) The "Pravda" published an article on the 15th by Soviet linguistics doctor Fedlin entitled "The Great Chinese Patriotic Poet," commemorating the 2230th anniversary of the death of the great Chinese poet Qu Yuan. The article introduced Qu Yuan's life and works and their impact on classical Chinese literature. The article stated: The long history of Chinese literature reflects the profound and unique characteristics of the Chinese people, their culture, science, and art. The founders of Chinese literature and poetry, as well as the outstanding works of classical Chinese writers, are the artistic embodiment of the Chinese people's powerful spiritual strength and their love of freedom. Qu Yuan is one of those immortal poets and writers who stand at the forefront of the world's most outstanding literary creators. Qu Yuan was an outstanding poet of ancient China, whose masterpieces fascinate with their extraordinary imagery, rich vocabulary, and extraordinary poetic imagination. The article continued: The Chinese people, who gave the world a genius like Qu Yuan, are great and full of vitality. Loyalty to the motherland and to the people of the motherland is the source of these geniuses' talent, strong will, and beautiful hearts.

Qu Yuan dreamed of the happiness of his motherland and people; however, in the great national liberation war, under the glorious leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese people have attained this happiness. Thanks to the Chinese people's historically significant victory over their enslavers, a new, free, and democratic system of life has been established. In the young People's Republic of China, the culture of the free people has flourished on an unprecedented scale. The literature of New China highly values and develops the excellent traditions of ancient Chinese literature and is faithfully serving the people in the great cause of building a free and happy new life. The article concluded: Qu Yuan's works are the wealth of the Chinese people, and also the wealth of all progressive humanity, the wealth of all honest people who are fighting to defend peace, culture, national independence, and to establish friendship and cooperation between all nations.

(Xinhua News Agency, 16th) According to TASS, Moscow, 14th: A reading of works by Chinese writers was held in a summer park in Moscow on the 13th. At the meeting, Boris Morgunov, in a special program called "The Sun Shines on China," recited many Chinese literary works to the audience. He first recited Mao Zedong's "Qinyuanchun," followed by some chapters from Ding Ling's "The Sun Shines Over the Sanggan River," winner of the Stalin Prize, and Zhou Libo's "Hurricane," also a Stalin Prize winner. In addition, Morgunov also recited poems by Duanmu Hongliang, Ai Qing, and Lu Dian.

Muscovites welcomed the reading program "The Sun Shines on China." Morgunov has recited twenty-six times at the Palace of Culture of the Stalin Automobile Factory, the Compressor Factory, and the Club of the Kaliber Factory, as well as in concert halls and parks in Moscow.

    苏联语言学博士费德林著文纪念屈原
    莫斯科一个夏季公园举行中国作家作品朗诵会
    【新华社莫斯科十六日电】“真理报”十五日发表了苏联语言学博士费德林的一篇题为“伟大的中国爱国诗人”的文章，纪念中国伟大诗人屈原逝世二千二百三十周年。文章介绍了屈原的生平和创作及其对于中国古典文学的影响。文章说：悠久的中国文学史，反映了中国人民及其文化、科学、艺术的深刻的独有的特点。中国文学和诗的奠基者以及中国古典作家的优秀作品，是中国人民的强有力的精神力量及其对自由的爱好在艺术上的体现。屈原是那些站在世界上最杰出的文学创作者之前列的不朽诗人和作家之一。屈原是中国古代的卓越诗人，他的杰作以其非凡的形象、丰富的语汇和非凡的诗人想像力使人迷恋。文章接着说：给世界以像屈原这样的天才儿子的中国人民，他们的力量是伟大的、生气勃勃的。对祖国、对祖国人民的忠诚，是这些天才儿子的天才、坚强意志和美好心灵的源泉。
    屈原曾梦想过自己祖国和人民的幸福；但是，在伟大的民族解放战争中，在光荣的中国共产党领导之下，中国人民已得到了这个幸福。由于中国人民对他们的奴役者的有历史意义的胜利，新的、自由的、民主的生活制度确立了。在年青的中华人民共和国，自由人民的文化，已以空前的规模蓬勃地繁荣起来。新中国的文学很高地估价和发展古代中国文学的优良传统，而且正在建设自由、幸福的新生活的伟大事业中忠诚地为人民服务着。文章最后说：屈原的作品是中国人民的财富，同时也是全体进步人类的财富，是为维护和平、文化、民族独立和建立各国人民之间的友好与合作而斗争的所有诚实的人们的财富。
    【新华社十六日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科十四日讯：莫斯科的一个夏季公园在十三日举行了中国作家作品朗诵会。会上，鲍里斯·莫尔古诺夫在一个叫作“太阳照耀着中国”的特别节目中，向听众朗诵了许多中国文学作品。他首先朗诵了毛泽东的“沁园春”，接着朗诵了斯大林奖金得奖人丁玲的“太阳照在桑干河上”、斯大林奖金得奖人周立波的“暴风骤雨”中的一些章节。此外，莫尔古诺夫还朗诵了端木蕻良、艾青和芦甸的诗。
