    Korean Children in Bulgaria
    At the foot of the Liulin Mountains near Sofia is a famous hot spring. There, amidst green parks and meadows, are many sanatoriums and convalescent homes. Among them, the largest white building, nestled among chestnut trees and poplar groves, is exclusively for Korean children.
    When these Korean children arrived in Bulgaria, the fields were busy with harvesting. A Red Cross special train sped through the fertile Dobruja plains, the Balkan Mountains, and the vast Plovdiv plain. Locals watched the dark-haired children leaning against the train windows, waving their arms in welcome. Along the way, Young Pioneer members, youth, mothers, and labor heroes came to the stations to warmly welcome these young guests. Bulgarian mothers embraced their small, thin bodies with warm arms, kissing their little faces, and showering these unfamiliar orphans with boundless maternal affection.
    A full year has passed since then. The children have quickly become familiar with this beautiful environment, living a settled and happy life here. This is not only a sanatorium but also a summer camp and a school. The children not only play here but also study general Korean courses and the Bulgarian language. Fifth-grade students are already studying alongside Bulgarian students. They study together, play together, exchange ideas, and deepen their friendship. The Korean children's accounts of their experiences and their homeland often moved the Bulgarian students.
    The Korean children are not lonely at all. Almost every holiday brings visitors. Farmers from nearby agricultural production cooperatives often bring them cakes and fruits. Many visitors inquire about everything with concern, and the children respond by performing Korean, Soviet, and Bulgarian songs and dances as a token of gratitude.
    The Korean children have their own Young Pioneer organization. The Young Pioneer Committee plans and arranges various activities, such as meetings with Bulgarian Young Pioneers or artists, organizing trips, parties, and so on. The committee once held a competition for drawings, poems, and short essays about Stalin's life. The winners received prizes.
    Drawing is the children's favorite activity. Their drawing boards are filled with various interesting subjects: a small house with a large tree in front, a child standing at the door; a People's Army tank on the attack; the snow-capped Mount Paektu, and so on. During the month of Korean-Bulgarian friendship, new content appeared on the drawing boards: the children's gratitude to the Bulgarian people, the young guests on the Red Cross train, visiting Bulgarian farmers, the handshake between Korean and Bulgarian Young Pioneers...
    Every Young Pioneer group has its own meetings. Younger children are taught to cherish time. Children who are late for class are taught: every minute is precious; in just five minutes, a combat hero can create immortal feats for the motherland; in five minutes, a Korean worker can produce thousands of bullets for the front line; similarly, in five minutes, a Young Pioneer can
    learn and do many things. Therefore, children should use every
    minute and not waste it.
    The children sometimes hold meetings under the slogan "Kim Il-sung is our role model." At these meetings, they learn about the life of their beloved leader, read various magazines, articles, and pictures about him, and share their thoughts and experiences after studying. Learning from the example of their leader is the ideal of every Young Pioneer.
    The central slogan for the older children is: "Be excellent students now, and become model citizens in the future!" At meetings, they often discuss their work and their future responsibilities to the motherland. They will become future builders, engineers, teachers, and workers, and they will rebuild the war-torn motherland into a prosperous and thriving country. Therefore, the better they study now, the better they will be able to complete their tasks in the future. Kang Young-nam, a fifth-grade student, said: "Excellent grades are the best gift to our motherland."
    The children love and excel in singing and dancing. Young Pioneer Ma Shen-jian leads the choir. The girls are very fond of dancing. The drama group often performs one-act plays. Sports are also very popular among the children, and they have organized many fitness groups, shooting groups, football teams, and chess groups.
    Inside the children's house is a well-decorated library. The children regularly receive newspapers sent from home, which report on the situation in the motherland to these young citizens. There is also a room dedicated to radio and aviation enthusiasts. There are radios and various parts, airplane models, and so on. Children who love woodworking also made some wooden boxes and hung them in the garden for the birds to nest in.
    On Sundays or holidays, the older children wear white uniforms, red scarves, and go to Sofia to visit, tour, or watch plays. Wherever they go, they receive a warm welcome and care. The Bulgarian people know that caring for these children is supporting and assisting the just struggle of the Korean people. (Attached picture)

    朝鲜儿童在保加利亚
    索非亚附近利乌林山的山脚下有一处著名的温泉。那里，在绿色的公园和草地中间，座落着许多休养所和疗养院。其中位于栗子树和白杨丛中的一座最大的白色建筑，是专供朝鲜儿童们居住的。
    当这些朝鲜儿童来到保加利亚的时候，田间正在紧张地进行收割。一列红十字会的专车，飞奔过肥沃的多布鲁查原野、巴尔干山和普洛夫迪大平原。附近的人们注视着倚在火车窗边的长着一头黑发的孩子，向他们摇着手臂表示欢迎。一路上，少年儿童队员、青年、母亲和劳动英雄们，都来到车站热烈地欢迎这些年幼的客人。保加利亚的母亲们用自己温暖的手臂拥抱着他们的瘦小的身子，吻着他们的小脸，对这些不相识的孤儿们给予无限的母亲的热情。
    从那时到现在，已经过去整整一年了。孩子们已很快地熟悉了这个悠美的环境，在这里过着安定的、愉快的生活。这里不仅是一个休养所，而且也是一座夏令营和一所学校。孩子们不仅在这里玩耍，也在这里学习着朝鲜的一般课程和保加利亚语文。五年级的学生已经和保加利亚学生一起学习了。他们一起研究，一起游玩，彼此交换着心得，增进着友谊。朝鲜小朋友们所讲的自己的遭遇和关于他们祖国的情况，常常激动了保加利亚同学们的心情。
    朝鲜孩子们是一点也不感到寂寞的。几乎每一个假日都有客人来访问。附近农业生产合作社的农民们常常给他们带来一些糕饼和水果，许多访问者关怀地探问着他们的一切，而孩子们就为这些客人表演朝鲜的、苏联的和保加利亚的歌舞，表示答谢。
    朝鲜孩子们有他们自己的少年先锋队组织。少年先锋队委员会计划着和安排着各种活动，例如和保加利亚的少先队员们或艺术家们会见，举办旅行、晚会等等。委员会曾经举办过一次关于斯大林生平的图画、诗歌和短文的比赛。优胜的得到了奖品。
    绘画是儿童们最喜爱的。他们的画板上充满着各种有趣的题材：一所小屋门前长着一棵大树，一个孩子站在门口；一辆进攻中的人民军坦克；覆盖着皑皑白雪的白头山等等。在保朝友好月中，画板上出现了新的内容：孩子们对保加利亚人民的感谢，红十字会列车上的年幼的客人，来访的保加利亚农民，朝鲜和保加利亚少先队员们的握手……
    每一个少先队小组都有自己的集会。较小的孩子们被教导要珍惜时间。对那些上课迟到的孩子这样教导：每一分钟时间都是宝贵的；在短短的五分钟内，一个战斗英雄可以为了祖国创造不朽的功绩；在五分钟内，一个朝鲜的工人能够为前线生产成千发的子弹；同样，在五分钟内，一个少先队员可以
    学到和做到不少事情。因此，孩子们应该利用每一
    分钟的时间，而不要把它浪费。
    孩子们有时在“金日成是我们的榜样”的口号下举行集会。在这种会上，他们学习着自己敬爱的领袖的生平事迹，阅读关于他的各种杂志、文章与图片，并在学习以后谈出自己的心得和体会。学习自己领袖的榜样，是每一个少先队员的理想。
    大一些的孩子们的中心口号是：“现在作优秀的学生，将来作模范的公民！”在会上，他们常常讨论自己的工作，和将来对祖国的责任。他们将成为未来的建设者、工程师、教员和工人，他们将把被战争毁坏了的祖国重建成为一个繁荣兴盛的国家。所以，他们现在学习得愈好，将来也就能把任务完成得愈好。五年级的学生康荣南说：“优秀的成绩，就是对我们祖国的最好的献礼。”
    孩子们都很热爱和擅长歌舞。少先队员马申健领导着合唱队。女孩子们对于舞蹈十分喜欢。戏剧小组则常常演出一些独幕剧。体育运动在孩子们中间也是十分普遍的，他们组织了许多健身小组，射击小组，足球队和象棋小组。
    在孩子们的屋内有一个装饰得很精致的图书馆。孩子们经常得到从国内寄来的报纸，它们向这些小公民们报道了祖国的情况。还有一间屋子是专门为无线电和航空爱好者们设置的。那里有无线电收音机和各种零件，飞机的模型等等。喜爱木工的孩子还做了一些木箱挂在林园里给小鸟做窝。
    到了星期天或休假日，大孩子们就穿着洁白的制服，戴着鲜红的领巾，到索非亚去参观、访问或观剧。无论他们走到那里，总会受到人们的热烈欢迎和关照。保加利亚人民知道，对于这些孩子们的关怀，也就是对于朝鲜人民的正义斗争的支持和援助。（附图片）
