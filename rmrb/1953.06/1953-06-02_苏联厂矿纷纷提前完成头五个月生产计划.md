Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 30th: Factories and mines in various parts of the Soviet Union have fulfilled their production plans for the first five months of this year ahead of schedule. In Moscow, workers at the Carburetor Factory, due to continuous improvements in production methods, especially the promotion of the new high-speed metal cutting method of Va. Kolesov, have completed their May production plan ten days ahead of schedule. Among the advanced enterprises that have completed the five-month plan are the "Metallurgist" Factory, the "Marat" Confectionery Factory, and many mines in the Moscow coal region. The "Metallurgist" Factory is striving to complete the June production plan before June 1. Workers at the "Marat" Confectionery Factory have guaranteed to overproduce products worth 9 million rubles before the end of May. Coal miners in the Moscow coal region have overproduced thousands of tons of coal.

In Azerbaijan, oil workers are constantly reporting their new labor achievements from Baku. The staff of the Burovning Well Drilling Engineering Department not only completed the five-month production plan ahead of schedule but also drilled ten more oil wells than the June production plan, saving the country approximately 2 million rubles. Workers at the Molotov No. 5 Oil Trust, after completing the five-month production plan, have already started production according to the June plan. They added special devices for hanging oil pipes on the oil wells and used new underground well repair methods, which not only reduced working hours but also eased the labor of workers and greatly increased production.

In the Urals, miners at the Magnitnaya Mine in Magnitogorsk have completed the original plan for mining and processing ore for the first five months ahead of schedule. Miners at the Lenin Coal Mine of the Kiesel Coal Industry Trust, responding to the initiative of the "Black Mountain" Coal Mine of the Donbass Stalin Coal Industry Trust, guaranteed to over-excavate and transport 50,000 tons of coal above the plan in the first six months of this year. However, from the beginning of this year to the present, the mine has overproduced about 40,000 tons of coal.

    苏联厂矿纷纷提前完成头五个月生产计划
    【新华社三十日讯】莫斯科消息：苏联各地厂矿纷纷提前完成今年头五个月的生产计划。在莫斯科，碳化器工厂的工人们，由于不断地改进生产方法，特别是由于推行了瓦·科列索夫的高速金属切削的新式车刀工作法，已提前十天完成了五月份的生产计划。在完成五个月计划的先进企业中，还有“冶金者”工厂、“马拉特”糖食工厂和莫斯科煤区的许多矿坑等。“冶金者”工厂正在争取在六月一日以前完成六月份的生产计划。“马拉特”糖食工厂的工人们已经保证，要在五月底以前超额生产价值九百万卢布的产品。莫斯科煤区的采煤工人已超额生产了数千吨煤。
    在阿塞拜疆，石油工人不断地从巴库报告他们新的劳动成就。布若夫宁凿井工程处的工作人员不仅提前完成了五个月的生产计划，而且还超过六月份的生产计划多钻了十个油井，为国家节省了约二百万卢布。莫洛托夫第五号石油托辣斯的工人们在完成了五个月的生产计划之后，已经按照六月份的计划进行生产。他们在油井上添加了悬挂油管的特殊装置，并使用新的地下修井法，结果，不仅减低了工作时间，而且还减轻了工人的劳动，大大地提高了生产量。
    在乌拉尔，马格尼托哥尔斯克的马格尼特纳耶矿山的矿工，已提前完成五个月采矿和对矿砂加工的原定计划。基塞尔煤业托辣斯列宁煤场的矿工，曾响应顿巴斯斯大林煤业托辣斯“黑山”煤场的倡议，保证要在今年头六个月内超计划挖运五万吨煤。但从今年年初到现在，该矿超计划生产的煤已达四万吨左右。
