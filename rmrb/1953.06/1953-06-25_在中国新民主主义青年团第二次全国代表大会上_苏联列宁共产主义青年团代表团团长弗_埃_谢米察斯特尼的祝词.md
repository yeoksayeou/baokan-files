Dear Comrades:

	On behalf of the 18 million members of the All-Union Leninist Young Communist League of the Soviet Union, 19 million Young Pioneers, and all the youth of the Soviet Union, I extend warm and fraternal greetings to you, and through you, to all members of the China New Democratic Youth League.

	The All-Union Leninist Young Communist League regards the China New Democratic Youth League as its own dear brother. The young men and women of our country follow the lives, work, and studies of Chinese youth with the greatest concern, and rejoice in every achievement of Chinese youth with pleasure.

	The China New Democratic Youth League has been established for four years now. These years have been a time of intense and unyielding struggle for the Chinese people under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party to achieve great democratic reforms, a time of restoring the national economy and achieving a fundamental improvement in the nation's economic situation. In the three years since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Chinese people have carried out land reform, completely restored agricultural and industrial production, restored damaged transportation lines, and eliminated inflation. This is a great victory for a people who have dreamed of a bright and happy life for centuries.

	The enemies of the Chinese people estimated that after politically defeating the reactionaries, the Chinese people would not be able to restore the damaged economy and would therefore have to submit to the imperialists. These wishful calculations, as long predicted, have completely gone bankrupt. For the imperialists, the victory of the Chinese people on the economic front is a huge blow to their plans and wishful calculations.

	The free Chinese people are now working enthusiastically, building new factories and mines, establishing powerful power stations, and laying new railways. The large-scale economic construction that has been launched powerfully demonstrates that the Chinese people are gloriously realizing their long-awaited ideal of national industrialization.

	I am very pleased to point out that Chinese youth, led by the China New Democratic Youth League, are at the forefront of the builders of the new, free China. We are delighted by your achievements in rebuilding the Anshan Iron and Steel Works, the Taiyuan Machine Factory, the Dalian Chemical Plant, and the Chongqing Power Station, and in the water conservancy projects in the Northeast and Northwest, and in the Yellow River, Chaobai River, and Huai River basins.

	We warmly salute the young miners and young petroleum workers who are actively involved in the mechanization of coal and oil extraction and the construction of new mines and oil wells. We extend fraternal greetings to the youth of Xiangtan City, Hunan Province, who are successfully transforming this small city into a large industrial center in the country.

	We are also pleased with your achievements in the patriotic movement for increased production and economy in industry.

	At this congress, we must also mention the great victories you have achieved in transforming the Chinese countryside. Chinese young men and women successfully master agricultural machinery, increase crop yields year by year, reclaim new fertile land from rivers and deserts, and actively help organize mutual aid teams and production cooperatives.

	Soviet youth are well aware that you have bravely participated in the action to aid the Korean people.

	The China New Democratic Youth League plays a significant role in the ideological education of Chinese youth, in raising the nation's culture, and in developing literature and the arts. We are well aware of the great work that the organizations of the China New Democratic Youth League are doing in expanding primary, secondary, and higher education, and in eliminating illiteracy.

	The great achievements of the Chinese people and Chinese youth in recent years have been achieved under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party headed by Comrade Mao Zedong. The China New Democratic Youth League has unlimited loyalty and firm confidence in the cause of the Party and is united around the Communist Party. This is the guarantee of your further achievements in mobilizing Chinese youth to build and consolidate the new China in all areas of work.

	Dear Comrades, Soviet youth, like you, are engaged in peaceful and creative labor. Soviet youth live a happy and joyful life, and a broad path towards knowledge, labor, and creation unfolds before them.

	In the short period since the war, the Soviet working people, under the leadership of the Communist Party, have restored the damaged industry, transportation, and agriculture, and have ensured that the production levels of all sectors of the socialist economy have greatly exceeded pre-war production levels. In 1952, the industrial products we produced increased by 2.3 times compared to the pre-war year of 1940, and the total grain harvest greatly increased compared to the pre-war years. Our industry and agriculture have obtained hundreds of thousands of modern new machines and mechanical equipment. Soviet culture and science are flourishing. The average annual expenditure on national education during the post-war period has been more than two and a half times the annual allocation for this area before the war. The Soviet Union is building housing and cultural and living facilities on a large scale. This April, the sixth post-war price reduction was implemented.

	In the recent speeches of Comrades Malenkov, Beria, and Molotov, the policies of the Soviet Communist Party in the current development of the Soviet Union, in the gradual transition from socialism to communism, were clarified. The essence of this policy is: to tirelessly care for the happiness of our working people, the security of our motherland, to continue to consolidate our socialist state, and to unswervingly adhere to the cause of maintaining and consolidating world peace.

	Now, the Soviet people and Soviet youth are closely united around the Party and the government, and they believe that their primary task is to use all means, resources, and all possibilities to unconditionally complete the policies formulated by our Party and move more smoothly along the road of building a communist society.

	These tasks can only be successfully completed under the condition of continuous high growth in production in all sectors of industry and agriculture. Therefore, the Soviet people and all Soviet youth are now working with great enthusiasm in order to victoriously complete the Fifth Five-Year Plan. The Fifth Five-Year Plan stipulates that by the end of 1955, industrial production will increase three times compared to 1940, grain harvest will increase by 40 to 50 percent compared to 1950, and national income will increase by 60 percent in five years.

	The new Five-Year Plan stipulates a series of important measures in cultural construction. At the end of the Five-Year Plan, the transition from seven-year secondary education to complete secondary education will be completed in large cities; and conditions will be prepared for the full implementation of complete secondary education in all remaining cities and villages during the next Five-Year Plan period. Higher education will have a greater scale. The material welfare of the Soviet people will be further improved. At the end of the Five-Year Plan, the real wages of workers will increase by 35 percent, and the income of farmers will increase by 40 percent.

	The All-Union Leninist Young Communist League educates Soviet young men and women in the spirit of constant concern for the interests of the state and the people, and launches competitions among young people in all work sectors fighting for communism. In all sectors of industry and agriculture, the youth educated by the Communist Youth League demonstrate their creativity and initiative.

	In the metallurgical industry, young steelworkers in the Urals and Ukraine initiated rapid metal smelting; young miners in Donbass and Kuzbass launched a competition to maximize the utilization rate of machinery; in the machine manufacturing industry, young workers in Moscow and Leningrad invented high-speed cutting methods; young petroleum workers in Azerbaijan and Bashkir successfully mastered rapid drilling methods; young workers at the Moscow Stalin Automobile Factory put forward valuable suggestions for saving metal; young textile workers in Moscow and Ivanovo achieved great success in the competition to save raw materials and materials and to produce high-quality products. Rural Communist Youth League members in Kuban organized a mass youth movement to implement full mechanization in agriculture.

	Such examples are countless. Soviet youth never stop at the achievements they have already made. Every day, many messages are reported about the outstanding work achievements of our young men and women. All of our achievements are the result of the constant care and concern of the Soviet Communist Party and the Soviet government for young people.

	The Communist Youth League was founded and nurtured by the Communist Party. It is the Communist Party's fighting assistant and reliable reserve. Since its founding, the Leninist Young Communist League has travelled a long and glorious path and has become a mass organization that has cultivated millions of Soviet patriots—active builders of communist society. The Communist Party's constant leadership in the activities of the Communist Youth League is the source of the Communist Youth League's consolidation and strength. Just as living things cannot survive without air and water, the Communist Youth League cannot survive without the constant leadership of the Communist Party. The Leninist Young Communist League is closely united around its mother—the Communist Party. It is infinitely loyal to the Party and is always ready to complete any task assigned to it by the Party.

	Comrades! It is unnecessary to prove to what extent the forces of peace and democracy have grown due to the unity of the peoples of China and the Soviet Union, and due to the continuous strengthening of fraternal, friendly unity among the peoples of all countries fighting against the instigators of a new war.

	The Soviet people and Soviet youth, like all people, abhor war. What we want is: how to consolidate the socialist edifice in which we live, how to make the lives of the Soviet people better. We Soviet youth, together with the entire Soviet people, will continue to firmly and unswervingly implement the policy of consolidating peace and developing international cooperation formulated by the Soviet Communist Party and the Soviet government. Soviet youth, educated in the spirit of proletarian internationalism, will use all their strength to develop and consolidate friendship with all progressive youth around the world.

	The historic achievements of the People's Republic of China have inspired millions of people around the world. These achievements are the great peaceful victories achieved by the great Chinese people, and are their invaluable contribution to the cause of all progressive humanity's struggle for peace and democracy. In Chinese youth, we see brave and resolute fighters for peace and democracy, and the advanced ranks of progressive youth worldwide.

	Dear friends! Strong and unbreakable friendship unites the peoples of China and the Soviet Union. The fraternal ties between the youth of our two countries are growing and strengthening year by year. "Sino-Soviet friendship" is a great and powerful force in the cause of consolidating peace throughout the world. In the history of mankind, past and present, there is no force that can compare with it.

	Chinese youth can be confident that Soviet youth will remain their loyal and reliable friends in the future.

	On behalf of all members of the All-Union Leninist Young Communist League of the Soviet Union, all members of the Soviet Young Pioneers, and all the youth of the Soviet Union, I wish the Chinese youth, led by the China New Democratic Youth League, new and brilliant victories in the cause of building and consolidating their free and great motherland.

	Long live the eternal and unbreakable friendship between the peoples and youth of China and the Soviet Union!

	Long live the glorious and excellent Chinese youth and its advanced ranks—the China New Democratic Youth League!

	Long live the great Chinese people and their vanguard—the Chinese Communist Party!

	Long live Comrade Mao Zedong, the leader of the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese government!

    在中国新民主主义青年团第二次全国代表大会上
    苏联列宁共产主义青年团代表团团长弗·埃·谢米察斯特尼的祝词亲爱的同志们：
    我代表苏联列宁共产主义青年团一千八百万团员和一千九百万少年先锋队队员，我代表苏联全国青年，向你们，并通过你们向中国新民主主义青年团全体团员致以热烈的、兄弟的敬礼。
    苏联列宁共产主义青年团把中国新民主主义青年团看作自己的亲兄弟。我国青年男女以最大的关心注视着中国青年的生活、工作和学习，并且怀着愉快的心情庆贺中国青年的每一个成就。
    中国新民主主义青年团建立到现在已经有四年了。这几年是中国人民在中国共产党领导下为了实现巨大的民主改革而紧张顽强地斗争的年代，是恢复国民经济和实现国家经济情况根本好转的年代。中华人民共和国成立三年多来，中国人民实行了土地改革，完全恢复了农业和工业生产，恢复了遭受破坏的交通运输线，消灭了通货膨胀。这是好几世纪以来一直幻想着光明幸福生活的人民的巨大胜利。
    中国人民的敌人估计，中国人民在政治上战胜了反动派之后，不能恢复被破坏的经济，因此将不得不向帝国主义者屈服。这些如意算盘，正如老早所预料的，已经完全破产了。对于帝国主义者来说，中国人民在经济战线上的胜利，就是对于他们的计划和如意算盘的一个巨大的打击。
    自由的中国人民现在正在热情地劳动着，建设着新的工厂和矿井，建立着强大的发电站，铺设着新的铁路线。已经展开的大规模的经济建设有力地证明，中国人民正在光荣地实现着自己所久已盼望着的国家工业化的理想。
    我要很高兴地指出，以中国新民主主义青年团为首的中国青年走在新的自由中国建设者的前列。你们在重建着鞍山的钢铁工厂、太原机器厂、大连化学厂和重庆的发电站，在东北和西北，在黄河、潮白河和淮河流域的水利工程建筑方面所获得的成就，都使我们感到高兴。
    我们热烈地向积极参与煤和石油采掘机械化以及新矿井和石油井建设工作的青年矿工们和青年石油工人们致敬。我们向湖南省湘潭市的青年们致以兄弟的敬礼，他们顺利地将要把这个小城市改变成为国内巨大的工业中心。
    你们在工业增产节约爱国运动中的成就，也使我们感到高兴。
    在这次大会上也不能不提到你们在改造中国农村方面所获得的巨大胜利。中国青年男女们成功地掌握着农业机器，一年一年地增加着农作物的收获量，从河流和沙漠那里夺回新的肥沃的土地，并积极地帮助组织互助组和生产合作社。
    苏联青年很清楚地知道，你们英勇地参加了援助朝鲜人民的行动。
    中国新民主主义青年团在对中国青年进行思想教育，在提高国家文化和发展文学艺术方面，起着巨大的作用。我们很清楚地知道中国新民主主义青年团的组织在扩展初等、中等和高等学校，以及在扫除文盲中所进行的巨大工作。
    中国人民和中国青年这几年的伟大成就，是在以毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党的领导下获得的。中国新民主主义青年团对党的事业具有无限的忠诚和坚定的信心，并团结在共产党的周围，这就是你们在动员中国青年建设和巩固新中国的一切工作中获得进一步成就的保证。
    亲爱的同志们：苏联青年和你们一样，正在从事着和平的、创造性的劳动。苏联青年过着幸福愉快的生活，在他们面前展开着走向知识、劳动和创造的宽广的大道。
    在战后短短的时间内，苏联劳动人民在共产党的领导下恢复了被破坏的工业、运输业和农业，并保证了社会主义经济各个部门的生产水平大大超过战前的生产水平。一九五二年，我们生产出的工业产品与战前一九四○年相比，增加为二点三倍，谷物总收获量比战前年代大大地增多。我国工业和农业获得了数十万部现代化的新式机器和机械装备。苏联的文化和科学正在蓬勃发展。战后时期每年的国民教育经费的平均数都为战前每年拨给这方面的经费的两倍半以上。苏联正在大规模地建筑着住宅和文化生活设备。今年四月间，实行了战后第六次减低物价。
    在马林科夫同志、贝利亚同志和莫洛托夫同志最近的演说中，表明了在苏联目前的发展情况下、在从社会主义逐渐过渡到共产主义的情况下，苏联共产党的政策。这个政策的实质是：不倦地关怀我国劳动人民的幸福、我们祖国的安全，要继续巩固我们的社会主义国家，要始终不渝地坚持维护和巩固世界和平的事业。
    现在，苏联人民和苏联青年紧密地团结在党和政府的周围，他们认为他们的首要任务就是利用所有的办法、资源以及利用一切的可能性，无条件地完成我们党所制订的政策，更顺利地沿着建设共产主义社会的道路迈进。
    这些任务必须在工业、农业各个部门的生产不断高涨的条件下，才可能顺利完成。因此，苏联人民和苏联全体青年现在正怀着高度的热情从事劳动，以便胜利地完成第五个五年计划，第五个五年计划规定：到一九五五年年底，工业的生产量要增加为一九四○年的三倍，谷物收获量要比一九五○年增加百分之四十到五十，国民收入在五年内将增加百分之六十。
    新的五年计划规定了在文化建设方面的一系列重要措施。在五年计划终结时，在大城市里将要完成从七年制中等教育过渡到完全的中等教育；并将要为下一个五年计划期间在其余的城市和乡村中全部实行完全的中等教育准备条件。高等教育则将具有更大的规模。苏联人民的物质福利将更进一步提高，五年计划终结时，工人的实际工资将增加百分之三十五，农民的收入将增加百分之四十。
    苏联列宁共产主义青年团以经常关怀国家和人民利益的精神教育苏联青年男女，在为共产主义而斗争的一切工作部门的青年中间展开竞赛。在工业和农业的所有部门中，共产主义青年团所教育出来的青年都表现着自己的创造性和主动性。
    在冶金工业方面，乌拉尔和乌克兰的青年炼钢工人发起了快速熔炼金属；顿巴斯和库兹巴斯的青年矿工展开了争取最大限度地提高机械利用率的竞赛；在机器制造工业方面，莫斯科和列宁格勒的青年工人们发明了高速切削法；阿塞拜疆和巴什基尔的青年石油工人们顺利地掌握着快速钻井法；莫斯科斯大林汽车工厂的青年工人们提出了节约金属的宝贵建议；莫斯科和伊凡诺佛的青年纺织女工们在争取节约原料和材料、争取出产优等质量产品的竞赛中获得了很大的成绩。库班的农村的共产主义青年团员组织了争取在农业中实行全盘机械化的青年群众运动。
    这样的例子是数不胜数的。苏联青年决不停止在已达到的成就上。每天都传来许许多多我国青年男女获得显赫的工作成就的消息。我们所有的这些成就，都是苏联共产党和苏联政府对青年经常照顾和关怀的结果。
    共产主义青年团是共产党所创立和抚育长大的，它是共产党战斗的助手，是共产党可靠的后备军。列宁共产主义青年团从创立的时候起，已走过了一条长远的、光荣的道路而成为一个群众性的组织，它培养了千百万的苏维埃爱国者——共产主义社会的积极建设者。共产党对于共产主义青年团活动的经常领导，是共产主义青年团巩固和力量的泉源。正如生物不能离开空气和水而生存一样，共产主义青年团是不能离开共产党的经常领导而生存的。列宁共产主义青年团紧密地团结在自己的母亲——共产党的周围，它无限忠诚于党，随时准备着完成党所交给它的任何任务。
    同志们！由于中苏两国人民的团结，由于为反对新战争挑拨者而斗争的世界各国人民间兄弟般友好团结的不断加强，和平民主力量已增长到何种程度，这是已经用不着证明的了。
    苏联人民，苏联青年，和所有的人一样，是厌恶战争的。我们所想的是：如何巩固我们生活于其中的社会主义大厦，如何使苏联人的生活过得更美好。我们苏联青年，和苏联全国人民一起，今后仍将坚定地、始终不渝地实行苏联共产党和苏联政府所制定的巩固和平与发展国际合作的政策。用无产阶级国际主义精神教养出来的苏联青年，将以全力来发展和巩固与全世界一切进步青年之间的友谊。
    中华人民共和国所获得的历史性的成就，鼓舞了全世界千百万的人民。这些成就，是伟大中国人民所获得的巨大的和平的胜利，是他们对于全体进步人类争取和平民主的斗争事业所作的无可估计的贡献。在中国青年身上，我们看到了为争取和平民主而斗争的勇敢、刚毅的战士，看到了全世界进步青年的先进队伍。
    亲爱的朋友们！坚强的、牢不可破的友谊把中苏两国人民联结在一起。我们两国青年之间的兄弟般的联系，是在逐年地生长着，加强着。“中苏友好”是巩固全世界的和平这一事业的伟大的和强大的力量。在人类的历史上，过去和现在都没有任何力量可以和它相比。
    中国青年可以相信，苏联青年今后仍是他们的忠实可靠的朋友。
    我代表苏联列宁共产主义青年团全体团员和苏联少年先锋队全体队员，代表苏联全国青年，敬祝以中国新民主主义青年团为首的中国青年在建设和巩固自己自由的、伟大的祖国的事业中，获得新的、辉煌的胜利。
    中苏两国人民和青年永恒的、牢不可破的友谊万岁！
    光荣的、优秀的中国青年及其先进队伍——中国新民主主义青年团万岁！
    伟大的中国人民及其先锋队——中国共产党万岁！
    中国共产党和中国政府的领袖毛泽东同志万岁！
