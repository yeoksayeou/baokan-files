    [Report from this newspaper] After the national railway system criticized the mistake of blindly soliciting freight sources, the implementation of planned transportation has improved. In the first quarter, the original planned number of loaded cars was completed by 102.2%, an increase of 24.5% compared with the same quarter last year; among them, the number of cars loaded under the plan accounted for 73.5% of the total number of loaded cars, which was better than last year. The proportion of cars loaded under the plan in April and May was even higher than in the first quarter, basically ensuring the transportation needs of basic construction materials, production supplies, and grain allocation in various places.
    After some local railway departments corrected the mistake of blindly soliciting freight sources, due to a lack of correct understanding of planned transportation, they had a tendency to neglect organizing freight sources and researching freight flows. They relaxed contact with shippers, relaxed the publicity and explanation of planned transportation, waited for shippers to come to them, loaded those who submitted plans, and refused to transport those who did not submit plans. The Zhengzhou Railway Bureau preferred to leave empty cars rather than load tarpaulins. Some places even refused to provide a few cars for transporting seeds and agricultural tools, affecting the completion of certain transportation tasks and wasting transportation capacity.
    Currently, a major problem in planned transportation on the part of shippers is that some economic production departments cannot ship on schedule, which affects the implementation of planned transportation. First, this is reflected in the inaccuracy of shipping plans, which are often changed or canceled, and supplements are frequent. For example, the shipping plan of the Ministry of Light Industry of the Central People's Government in May was changed six times in six days from April 13th to 18th. In March, the Northeast Timber Allocation Bureau planned to ship 600 cars of timber from Lianjiangkou, but only 8.7% was actually completed. This created great difficulties for railway planned transportation and wasted railway transportation capacity. Second, the phenomenon of unreasonable shipping plans is serious. In April, the Harbin Railway Administration found more than 10,000 cars of goods that should not have been included in the plan when reviewing shipping plans. Third, many units did not go to the station for shipping in time after the car request plan was approved, so that railway planned transportation could not be realized evenly.
    These shortcomings in the implementation of shipping plans by various economic production departments are mainly due to insufficient understanding of planned transportation and the unrealistic plans they have prepared. Many units have not established transportation organizations and equipped a certain number of full-time cadres in accordance with the regulations of the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council, so they can only forward the car request plans submitted by their subordinate grassroots units every month, and cannot review and control the plans.
    In order to strengthen planned transportation, railway departments should strengthen planning management, strengthen the organization of freight sources, formulate freight flow charts of major goods to grasp the situation of freight sources and freight flows, and hold shipper meetings regularly to strengthen contact with shippers and urge them to submit and implement shipping plans on schedule. All economic production departments should correct their understanding of railway planned transportation and strengthen transportation work. Economic and financial leading organs at all levels should take the responsibility of supervising and inspecting to avoid violations of planned transportation.

### 全国铁路系统计划运输已有改进  有关部门应进一步保证计划运输的实现

    全国铁路系统计划运输已有改进
    有关部门应进一步保证计划运输的实现
   【本报讯】全国铁路系统批判了盲目招揽货源的错误后，计划运输的执行情况已有改进。第一季度完成了原订计划装车数量的百分之一百零二点二，比去年同季增加百分之二十四点五；其中计划内装车数占总装车数百分之七十三点五，较去年情况为好。四、五月份计划内装车数所占的比例又较第一季度提高，基本上保证了各地基本建设备料、生产供应、粮食调拨等运输需要。
    有些地区铁路部门在纠正盲目招揽货源的错误后，由于缺乏对计划运输的正确认识，曾产生了忽视组织货源、研究货流工作的偏向。放松和货主的联系，放松宣传和解释计划运输，坐待货主上门，提了计划的就给装，没有提计划的一概不运。郑州局宁肯放空车，拒绝装运篷布。有的地方甚至连运输种籽、农具的少数车辆也不给，影响了某些运输任务的完成，也浪费了运输力。
    目前，计划运输中属于货主方面的一个主要问题，是有些经济生产部门不能按期托运，影响计划运输的执行。首先，表现在托运计划不准确，常常变更或取消，追加频繁。如中央人民政府轻工业部五月份的托运计划，从四月十三日到十八日六天中，就变更了六次。三月份，东北木材调配局计划自莲江口运出木材六百车，实际仅完成百分之八点七。这样便给铁路计划运输造成很大的困难，浪费了铁路运输力。其次，托运计划不合理的现象严重存在，哈尔滨铁路管理局四月份在审核托运计划中，就查出一万余车货物不应该列入计划。再次，不少单位在要车计划批准后，没有及时去车站进行托运，致使铁路计划运输不能均衡地实现。
    各经济生产部门执行托运计划中的这些缺点，主要是由于对计划运输认识不足，编制的计划不切合实际。许多单位没有按政务院财政经济委员会的规定，建立运输机构，配备一定数量的专职干部，因此只能将所属基层单位每月所提出的要车计划照转一下，而不能审核和掌握计划。
    为了加强计划运输，铁路部门应加强计划管理，加强组织货源工作；制订主要货物的货流图，以掌握货源、货流情况，并定期召开货主会议，加强和货主的联系，督促他们按期提出和执行托运计划。各经济生产部门应端正对铁路计划运输的认识，加强运托工作。各级财经领导机关应负起督促和检查的责任，以避免违反计划运输事件的发生。
