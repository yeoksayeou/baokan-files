Xinhua News Agency, June 9th: The Swedish Cultural Delegation held a press conference in Beijing on the morning of June 9th. The representatives described their impressions gained during their one-and-a-half-month visit to New China.

The head of the delegation, agronomist Karl-Erik Mekqvist, first read out a statement issued by the delegation on its visit to New China. The statement said that during the one-and-a-half-month period, the delegation visited major cities in China, visited factories, rural areas, schools, nurseries, sanatoriums, hospitals, museums, etc. in China, and met and talked with people from a wide range of social strata in New China.

The statement pointed out the great achievements made by the Chinese people in building their own country in the four years after liberation and the improvement of the living standards of the Chinese people. The statement said: Facts can be seen everywhere proving that the Chinese people have a strong will to rebuild their country, and they are making every effort to complete the Five-Year Plan that began this year. The statement also pointed out that the delegation learned that the government of New China enjoys high prestige and love among the people; all the propaganda tools of New China are used to publicize peace and the importance of international understanding and cooperation. The statement said: After returning to their country, the delegation will do its best to convey the impressions they have gained in China to the Swedish people.

Bishop Theodor Arvidsson expressed his feelings about the religious freedom enjoyed by the people of New China. He said that in Western countries, very little is known about China's development in recent years. Western newspapers often spread many lies about New China, and a correct answer should be given to these lies.

Writer Harold Bayer said: The things that the delegation members saw in China left a deep impression on them. These things are little known in Sweden and Europe. He particularly mentioned the Chinese people's respect for past cultural traditions.

Mrs. Hofsten, editor of the Swedish magazine "Our Housewives," said that she was particularly impressed by New China's cherishing of children. She said: In New China, all the parents and childcare workers we saw were helping and understanding the children with deep love, which deeply moved people in our Western countries.

Member of Parliament Helmer Holmberg talked about the great achievements made by New China in economic construction. He said: In China, everyone is full of confidence in his future. Lawyer Harold Rubinstein talked about his impressions of visiting the courts and prisons of New China, pointing out the superiority of the judicial system of New China.

Architect Mats Linman paid special attention to the enthusiasm of the workers on the construction site and the high enthusiasm for learning of the architecture students in the university, saying that this was something he had never seen before. He also talked about the teaching method of combining theory with practice in architectural teaching.

Dr. Margit Krantz first mentioned the warm hospitality the representatives received in various places. She said: Your Chinese people's desire for peace is strong, and you are a strong force in defending world peace. She was deeply impressed by the patriotic health campaign being carried out by the Chinese people. She mentioned the Chinese people's will to eliminate all infectious diseases, and said: Throughout the entire trip, we have seen the government's emphasis on people's health.

Mrs. Karin Öding, Secretary-General of the Swedish-Chinese Friendship Association, mentioned the general interest of the people of New China in music, and especially praised the Exhibition of Cultural Relics and Pictures of Ethnic Minorities in the Central and Southern District and an introduction to Western music evening that she saw in Hankou.

Karl-Erik Mekqvist, head of the delegation and agronomist, mentioned in his personal speech the Shuangqiao Farm in the suburbs of Beijing, which he visited. He praised the achievements made by the Chinese people in agricultural construction in the short period of only four years since the end of the Liberation War. He said: Workers and peasants are enthusiastically building because they know they are working for their own happiness and a better future.
