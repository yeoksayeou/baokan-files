Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, June 29th: According to a report by TASS, the German News Agency reported that the Democratic League of the German Democratic Republic held a meeting on June 25th and adopted a statement on the events that occurred in the democratic sector of Berlin and other parts of the German Democratic Republic.

The statement said: The fascist provocations in the democratic sector of Berlin and other parts of the German Democratic Republic on June 17, 1953, were defeated. The "Day X," which was long-planned by the Bonn rulers and their foreign protectors, and intended to shake and destroy the foundations of the democratic system of the German Democratic Republic, ended in complete failure.

The statement pointed out: The agitators and organizers of the riots—Adenauer, Kaiser, and Lute—shamelessly wanted to use the victims of the atrocities they created to further incite hatred and discord among the German people. The events of June 17th themselves clearly demonstrate that broad sections of the people, especially the workers, are increasingly aware that the policies of the Adenauer government and its Bonn and Paris military treaties are attempts to intensify the "Cold War" and launch military conflicts. These conspiracies will inevitably be shattered, because the German people are firmly opposed to the conspiracy to launch a fratricidal war, and advocate restoring German unity and concluding a peace treaty.

The Democratic League called on all citizens to unanimously support the policies of the German Democratic Republic and implement the decisions of the government. This is the fastest way to meet the needs of the people.

The statement concluded: Our policy serves the interests of the people, the restoration of national unity, and the cause of defending peace. Now, more than ever, it is necessary for all peace-loving forces in East and West Germany to support the great peace initiatives made by the Soviet Union, People's China, North Korea, and all peace-loving forces for signing the Korean armistice agreement and peacefully resolving all disputes between countries.

    德意志民主共和国民主联盟发表声明
    号召德国人民贯彻执行政府的决定
    【新华社二十九日讯】据塔斯社柏林二十八日讯，德意志通讯社报道：德意志民主共和国民主联盟六月二十五日举行会议，就在柏林民主区和德意志民主共和国其他地方发生的事件通过了一项声明。
    声明说：一九五三年六月十七日在柏林民主区和德意志民主共和国其他地方的法西斯挑衅遭到了失败。波恩执政者及其外国保护人经过长期策划的
    “X日”，本意要动摇和摧毁德意志民主共和国的民主制度的基础，但却以完全失败而告终。
    声明指出：骚动的煽动者和组织者——阿登纳、凯撒、鲁特无耻地想利用他们所制造的暴行的牺牲者进一步煽动德国人民之间的仇恨和纠纷。六月十七日事件本身就明显地证明，广大的人民阶层特别是工人日益理解到，阿登纳政府及其波恩和巴黎军事条约的政策，是企图加紧“冷战”和发动军事冲突的。这些阴谋将必然被粉碎，因为德国人民坚决反对发动同族相杀的战争的阴谋，主张恢复德国的统一和缔结和约。
    民主联盟号召所有的公民一致支持德意志民主共和国的政策，贯彻执行政府的决定。这是一条能够最快地满足人民需要的道路。
    声明最后说：我们的政策是为人民利益、为恢复全国统一和保卫和平的事业服务的。苏联、人民中国、北朝鲜以及一切爱好和平的力量为签订朝鲜停战协定、和平解决各国间的一切争端作了伟大的和平倡议，现在比任何时候都更需要东西部德国所有和平力量来支持这种倡议。
