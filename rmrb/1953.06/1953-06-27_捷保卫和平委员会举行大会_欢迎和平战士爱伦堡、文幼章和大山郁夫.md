Xinhua News Agency, Prague, June 26th: The Czechoslovak Committee for the Defense of Peace held a congress at Charles University to welcome the Stalin International Peace Prize laureates "For Strengthening International Peace," Ilya Ehrenburg (Soviet Union), Wen Youzhang (Canada), and Professor Oyama Ikuo (Japan), who were passing through Prague on their way home after attending the World Peace Council meeting in Budapest. Among those attending the congress were: Anežka Hodinová-Spurná, Chairwoman of the Czechoslovak Committee for the Defense of Peace, composer V. Dobiáš, winner of the Gold Medal of Peace of the Permanent Committee of the World Peace Congress (the former name of the World Peace Council) in 1950, Vítězslav Nezval, winner of the Gold Medal of the World Peace Council, Jan Mukařovský, Rector of Charles University and Academician of the Academy of Sciences, Oldřich John, Chairman of the National Assembly of the Czechoslovak Republic, as well as prominent figures in the Czechoslovak cultural world and social celebrities.

Professor Oyama Ikuo said in his speech that he had received the Stalin International Peace Prize not because of his own merits, but because of the Japanese people's consistent struggle to defend peace. He said that if necessary, he would be willing to defend this honor with his life.

Professor Oyama Ikuo said that the Japanese people are doing their best to oppose the rearmament that foreign countries are forcing upon them. Japanese workers are uniting to fight. Joining the ranks of the peace movement are not only the working people of Japan, but also a large number of capitalists who advocate trade with China and the Soviet Union.

Oyama Ikuo said: The World Peace Council's decision to launch an international campaign for negotiation has given the Japanese people new courage. Inspired by the example of the signing of the POW agreement in Korea, they will carry the struggle for peace to the end until victory is achieved. In this way, the Japanese people can eliminate the guilt they feel towards humanity for not being able to prevent Japanese militarists from bringing war and suffering to vast regions of the world in the past.

Wen Youzhang then spoke, expressing that the Canadian people firmly believe that all international disputes can be resolved peacefully.

Ehrenburg was warmly welcomed at the meeting. He said that the World Peace Council meeting in Budapest was a victory for the defenders of peace, because the people of all countries have begun to intervene in the activities of their governments in a timely and effective manner. At the same time, he emphasized that the struggle for peace must be strengthened.

At the end of the congress, pianist Josef Palenicek played Beethoven's "Appassionata Sonata."

    捷保卫和平委员会举行大会
    欢迎和平战士爱伦堡、文幼章和大山郁夫
    【新华社布拉格二十六日电】捷克斯洛伐克保卫和平委员会在卡罗瓦大学举行大会，欢迎参加世界和平理事会布达佩斯会议后回国途中道经布拉格的“加强国际和平”斯大林国际奖金得奖人爱伦堡（苏联）、文幼章（加拿大）和大山郁夫教授（日本）。参加大会的有：捷克斯洛伐克保卫和平委员会主席安涅日卡·霍迪诺娃—斯普尔纳，一九五○年世界保卫和平大会常设委员会（世界和平理事会从前的名称）金质和平奖章得奖人、作曲家夫·杜比亚斯，世界和平理事会金质奖章得奖人、诗人维捷斯拉夫·奈兹瓦尔，卡罗瓦大学校长、科学院院士扬·穆卡罗夫斯基，捷克斯洛伐克共和国国民议会主席奥德里赫·约翰，以及捷克斯洛伐克文化界的杰出人士和社会名流。
    大山郁夫教授在会上发言说，他不是因为自己的功劳，而是因为日本人民保卫和平的一贯斗争而获得斯大林国际和平奖金的。他说，假如必要的话，他愿意以生命来维护这个荣誉。
    大山郁夫教授说，日本人民正尽全力反对外国强使他们进行的重新武装。日本工人正团结起来进行斗争。参加和平运动队伍的，不仅有全日本的劳动人民，而且还有大批主张与中国和苏联贸易的资本家。
    大山郁夫说：世界和平理事会关于展开国际争取协商运动的决定，给了日本人民新的勇气。在朝鲜签订战俘协议这个例子的鼓舞之下，他们将把争取和平的斗争进行到底，直到取得胜利。这样，日本人民过去因为没有能够防止日本军国主义者把战争和痛苦带给世界广大地区而对人类的负疚才能消除。
    文幼章接着发言，他表示加拿大人民深信一切国际争执问题都可以和平解决。
    爱伦堡在会上受到了热烈的欢迎。他说，世界和平理事会布达佩斯会议是和平保卫者的胜利，因为各国人民已开始恰是时候地、有效地过问他们政府的活动。同时，他强调说，争取和平的斗争必须加强。
    大会结束时由钢琴家约瑟夫·巴伦涅塞克弹奏了贝多芬的“热情奏鸣曲”。
