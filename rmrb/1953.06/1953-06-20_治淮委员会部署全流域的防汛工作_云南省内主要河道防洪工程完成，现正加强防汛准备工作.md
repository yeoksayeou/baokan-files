The Huai River flood season is approaching, and the Huai River Commission is actively deploying flood control work. From May 15th to 22nd, the Upper, Middle, and Lower Reaches Flood Control Conference was held, attended by more than 60 key responsible cadres from Henan, Anhui, Jiangsu provinces, and the Anhui provincial special district Huai River management agencies.

The conference decided that the 1953 Huai River flood control work should be combined with production and disaster relief, and that the Huai River management projects that should be completed during the flood season should be finished. The upper and middle reaches should make the greatest effort to ensure that the "Secure Dike" and "Flood Storage Dike" do not breach at the 1950-type highest flood level; the lower reaches should ensure that the 1931-type highest flood level is not breached; and the area affected by waterlogging in the entire basin should be smaller than last year, with each province and special district putting forward a guarantee plan based on the situation. For the control of floods, the Huai River Commission will control the Wangjiaba Mengwa water inlet gate, Runheji diversion gate, Donghu gate, Dongfei River gate, and Sanhe gate five flood storage gates on the main stream of the Huai River, opening and closing them according to the peak flow and water level controlled by Zhengyangguan; in addition, the upper, middle, and lower reaches will formulate their own control methods according to the existing project conditions.

The conference also decided that each province and special district should establish provincial and special district flood control headquarters based on the Huai River management agencies; the Huai River Commission will establish a flood control general headquarters, directly led by the Central Flood Control Headquarters, and will cooperate with the East China and Central South Flood Control Headquarters. The conference also put forward preliminary opinions on the resettlement and compensation issues in the flood storage areas and flood diversion areas, as well as flood control funds and wages.

Xinhua News Agency: The flood control projects on major rivers in Yunnan Province have been completed one after another. The whole province is strengthening flood control preparations to meet the upcoming rainy season flood season. The completed flood control projects include the Cixiang River flood diversion project in Jinning, the blasting beach project in Gaoguma area of Nanpan River in Yiliang, the straightening of the Matiawan river bend, the straightening of the Panlong River river bend in Kunming City and Kunming County, as well as the construction of flood discharge channels and spillway dam projects, the Dong River embankment protection project in Baoshan, and the Daying River flood control project running through Lianghe, Yingjiang, and Lianshan counties. The above rivers are all major rivers in Yunnan Province and are closely related to the lives of local people. For example, the Cixiang River has flooded for many years, submerging 30,000 to 40,000 mu of local farmland. This year, a pumping station was built upstream of the Cixiang River, and a new 5-kilometer-long river channel was opened to divert two-thirds of the river's floodwater into Dianchi Lake during the rainy season, preventing flooding.

This year, in Yunnan Province's rainy season flood control work, governments at all levels are particularly emphasizing leading farmers of all ethnic groups in mountain stream flood control. Various places will universally excavate mountain gullies to divert mountain floods. The Ministry of Water Resources of the Central People's Government has allocated 1 billion yuan for small-scale mountain stream flood control projects in rural areas. Water conservancy work teams in each special district will be dispatched during the flood season to help farmers carry out flood control work. Now, the water conservancy department of the Yunnan Provincial People's Government has established flood control work agencies and has added hydrological stations to strengthen flood reporting work. All localities are paying attention to patrolling the repaired river dikes and preparing for rescue work.

    治淮委员会部署全流域的防汛工作
    云南省内主要河道防洪工程完成，现正加强防汛准备工作
    淮河汛期即将到来，治淮委员会积极布置防汛工作。五月十五日到二十二日召开的上中下游防汛会议，有河南、安徽、江苏三省及安徽省各专区治淮机关的主要负责干部六十多人出席。
    会议决定：一九五三年的淮河防汛工作应结合生产救灾，并要完成汛期应该完成的治淮工程。上中游以最大努力争取保证一九五○年型最高洪水位
    “确保堤”及“蓄洪堤”不决口；下游保证一九三一年型最高洪水位不决口；全流域内涝受灾面积要比去年缩小，由各省、专区根据情况提出保证计划。对于洪水的控制，治淮委员会掌握淮河干流的王家坝濛洼进水闸、润河集分水闸、东湖闸、东淝河闸及三河闸五个蓄洪闸，根据正阳关控制的洪峰流量和水位情况启闭；此外，上中下游根据现有工程情况，自拟控制办法。
    会议并决定：各省、专区以治淮机构为基础，成立省及专区的防汛指挥部；治淮委员会设立防汛总指挥部，受中央防汛指挥部直接领导，同时与华东、中南防汛指挥部配合。关于蓄洪区、行洪区的迁移安置赔偿问题，以及防汛经费、工资等问题，会议也提出了初步意见。

    云南省内主要河道的防洪工程已陆续完成。全省正加强防汛准备工作，以迎接即将到来的雨季汛期。已完成的防洪工程包括晋宁境内的茨巷河分洪工程，宜良境内南盘江高古马地区炸滩工程和马蹄湾裁湾改直工程，昆明市和昆明县境的盘龙江河湾改直以及兴修泄洪道、溢水坝工程，保山境内的东河培修护堤工程以及贯穿在梁河、盈江、莲山三县境内的大盈江防洪工程等。以上河道都是云南省内的主要河道，和当地人民生活有着密切的关系。如茨巷河历年泛滥，淹没当地农田三四万亩。今年在茨巷河上游建筑抽水站，另辟一条五公里长的新河道，可将该河在雨季中三分之二的洪水量导入滇池，免去泛滥。
    云南省今年的雨季防汛工作，各级人民政府特别着重领导各族农民进行山溪防洪。各地将普遍挖掘山沟，分泻山洪。中央人民政府水利部已拨发十亿元作为农村山溪防洪小型工程的费用。各专区的水利工作队将在汛期内出动，帮助农民进行防洪工作。现在，云南省人民政府水利部门已经设立了防汛工作机构，并已增设水文站以加强报汛工作。各地正注意巡护已修河堤，进行抢险的准备工作。 （新华社）
