    CCP Jiexiu County Songcun Village Branch Summarizes Methods for Leading Agricultural Production

    Li Buguang, Zhang Houqi, and Zhang Guangyao of the CCP Jiexiu County Committee Office, Shanxi Province, wrote: After the spring plowing and sowing ended, the Songcun Village Branch of the CCP Jiexiu County Third District held a general meeting of all party members to seriously examine the branch's leadership in production. Through this examination, they initially explored the following two working methods for leading production.

    I. Use typical demonstrations to break the masses' conservative thinking and promote advanced experiences. For example, the masses in the village were unwilling to apply fertilizer powder to wheat fields. Despite many meetings last year, no one used it. This year, the party branch adopted the working method of typical demonstration. The branch secretary, Song Yuan, and the village chief, Li Xiling (a party member), first applied fertilizer powder to five mu of wheat fields. Within seven days, the five mu of wheat fields changed dramatically. They used this fact to thoroughly promote the benefits of fertilizer powder to the masses. The peasants, seeing with their own eyes that the fertilizer powder was indeed effective, rushed to buy it. As a result, the villagers bought a total of 480 jin and proposed using 2,000 jin for the “autumn land.”

    II. Organize on-site observations, implement technical guidance, and promote production. For example, Li Baoshan's mutual aid team had good corn growth, and farmer Mu Yizhong had a bumper wheat harvest. The branch purposefully organized eight mutual aid team leaders and seven experienced veteran farmers for field observation. Li Baoshan introduced that the corn seedlings grew vigorously because the seeds were soaked, red alum was used to kill insects, seeds were carefully selected, and sand was spread in the fields to transform the soil. The 1.15 mu of corn land originally lacked 50 seedlings, which were later replanted; with each seedling producing one cob, yielding at least half a jin, replanting the 50 seedlings could increase production by 25 jin. This calculation made everyone believe in the practice of "for bumper harvest, all seedlings must be complete." Mu Yizhong's high-yield wheat had large ears that could not be cut through with one sickle because he paid attention to seed selection, close planting, rational fertilization, careful plowing, and meticulous cultivation (the soil in the area was moist, plowed twice, hoed once, and harrowed six times). This observation promoted the checking and replanting of seedlings by four mutual aid teams, including Wang Dingchen's. After returning to his team, Li Baoshan discussed fertilization with his team members and prepared to apply 540 jin of fertilizer powder as top dressing to autumn crops. The villagers' confidence in a bumper harvest was greatly enhanced. Bumper harvest signs were inserted in 21 plots of wheat and autumn land, and initial preparations were made for seed selection during the summer harvest.

    Currently, the Songcun Village Branch is building on this foundation, focusing on checking and transplanting seedlings, equidistant thinning, and ensuring complete seedlings, purposefully carrying out interlinked competitions to promote production.

    中共介休县宋?村支部总结领导农业生产的方法
    中共山西省介休县委会办公室李步光、张厚祺、张光耀来信：中共介休县三区宋?村支部在春耕下种结束后召开了全体党员大会，认真检查了支部对生产的领导。通过这次检查，初步摸索到以下两个领导生产的工作方法。
    一、用典型示范的方法来打破群众的保守思想，推广先进经验。如该村群众不愿在麦田上肥田粉，去年开了多少会，结果谁也没用。今年党支部采取了典型示范的工作方法，支部书记宋员、村长李锡龄（党员）先上了五亩麦田的肥田粉，没过七天，五亩麦田大变了样。他们用这一事实向群众深入宣传肥田粉的好处。农民们亲眼看到肥田粉真顶事，纷纷要买。结果全村农民共买了四百八十斤，并提出“秋地”还要用两千斤。
    二、组织现场观摩，贯彻技术指导，推动生产。如李宝山互助组玉茭长得好，农民穆以忠小麦丰产，支部就有准备地组织了八个互助组长和七个有经验的老农进行田间观摩。李宝山介绍了玉茭苗子长的旺是因为浸了种，上红矾杀虫，精选种籽和地里铺沙改造了土壤。一亩一分五玉茭地原缺五十株苗，后来都补上了；每株苗以一穗计，至少能收半斤，补了五十株即可增产二十五斤。这样一算账，使大家相信了“要丰产、苗十全”的做法。穆以忠的丰产小麦穗头大，一镰割不透，是因为注意了选种、密植和合理施肥、精耕细作（该地土质湿润，共犁过两次，刨过一次，耙过六次）。这次观摩推动了王定臣等四个互助组进行了查苗补苗。李宝山回组后，又和组员讨论施肥工作，准备在秋季作物中上追肥肥田粉五百四十斤。全村农民丰产信心大为提高，二十一块麦秋地都插了丰产牌子，初步作好了夏收时选种的准备工作。
    目前，宋?村支部正在这一基础上，以查苗移苗、等距留苗、保证全苗为中心，有准备地开展联环竞赛，来推动生产。
