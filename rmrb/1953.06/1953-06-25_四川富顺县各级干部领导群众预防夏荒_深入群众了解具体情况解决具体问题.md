Cadres at All Levels in Fushun County, Sichuan Province, Lead the Masses to Prevent Summer Famine
Deeply Understand the Specific Situation of the Masses and Solve Specific Problems
    The leading cadres at all levels in Fushun County, Sichuan Province, learned from the lessons of neglecting to lead the masses to survive the famine during spring plowing and production. During rice transplanting, they loudly put forward the slogan of "economizing to prevent famine, storing grain to prepare for famine" and actively led the masses to engage in production for self-relief to prevent summer famine. At present, some areas with historical famines have curbed the development of summer famine and can gradually overcome it.
    Most district and township cadres conducted typical investigations on the summer famine situation in late April, initially gaining a clear understanding of the situation and root causes of the summer famine, and recognizing the harm of the increasingly severe summer famine to production. According to statistics from 52 villages in the mountainous areas of the county, 1,602 households, accounting for about one-third of the total number of households, would lack grain for 30 to 40 days from rice transplanting to autumn harvest. At that time, the summer famine was just beginning to emerge, because this year's spring famine was serious, broad beans and peas had poor harvests, and last autumn's harvest was also poor. It was estimated that the possibility of the summer famine developing more and more seriously was very high. In order to curb the development of summer famine and lead the masses to successfully overcome the summer famine, the county successively focused on summarizing the spring famine situation in April and May, and got to the bottom of the summer famine. Districts and townships mobilized the masses to find shortcuts for sideline occupations. Areas with existing sideline occupations focused on studying how to improve the quality and specifications of sideline products and expand sales channels; areas lacking sideline occupations mobilized the masses to find them, from the district, the township, neighboring districts and townships, do a little where you can find it, and do it where you can. At the same time, deeply publicize and implement the policy of free lending, and mobilize the masses to help each other and tide over difficulties. Sun Keyu, secretary of the Fushun Ninth District Committee of the Communist Party of China, and Zhou Jiqiu, district head, went deep into the countryside to understand the specific situation and solve specific problems, so that grain-deficient households could also achieve full planting. Fushun implemented the policy of "production for self-relief," widely publicized the policy of developing agricultural production, and promptly dispelled the masses' idea of simply relying on government relief. The Ninth District divided grain-deficient households into three types, lined them up, and solved them specifically: 1. Those with labor were organized into transportation teams, and contracts were signed with cooperatives for transportation, which solved the livelihood difficulties of 35 households. 2. Those lacking labor were organized to engage in sideline occupations with sales channels, mainly weaving "baozis". Chen Xinghai, a Communist Party member in Wanmin Village, Zhonghe Township, took the initiative to sign a "contract to teach and learn" with the grain-deficient households in the village, enabling all the grain-deficient households in the village to learn to weave "baozis" within ten days. 3. The elderly without labor who cannot engage in sideline occupations are given loans for relief by the government. Most district and township leaders attached importance to the sales of sideline products, and supply and marketing cooperatives also closely cooperated with this work.
    When publicizing and implementing the policy of free lending, all localities conducted patient persuasion and education to address the ideological concerns of households with surplus grain, and dealt with the old debts of the past, so as to achieve "voluntary lending and mutually negotiated interest rates." Lin Hanqing (middle peasant), a member of the Gan Shaohua mutual aid group in Fuhe Township, lent out more than twelve piculs of grain in 1951 and 1952 without recovering it. In the past, poor peasants and hired laborers thought, "When it reaches the hands of the poor, they will never have it to give back," and delayed repayment, and the cadres did not care. Therefore, although he heard the propaganda about the policy of free lending, he was still unwilling to lend out a single grain of surplus. After the township cadres learned about this situation, they immediately educated the poor peasants and hired laborers who had borrowed grain and had not repaid it, explaining that things borrowed from others should be returned to others, and it would be easy to borrow again if you repay what you borrowed; the poor peasants and hired laborers who had borrowed grain generally realized that it was wrong not to repay what they had borrowed. Although they were in difficulty, they could not lose their credit. Therefore, they all expressed their willingness to pay off the principal and interest in installments and batches. For example, the hired laborer Jian Shaoqing borrowed five pecks of grain from Lin Hanqing in 1951 and had been dragging his feet on repayment, but after being educated and understanding the policy, he consciously and voluntarily expressed his willingness to pay off the principal and interest together after this year's autumn harvest. After publicizing and explaining the policy and dealing with the old debts, Lin Hanqing voluntarily lent out more than two piculs of grain, enabling their mutual aid group to achieve full planting.
    Due to the implementation of the spirit of "economizing to prevent famine, storing grain to prepare for famine" from top to bottom, many farmers broke with the old habits and saved a large amount of grain during rice transplanting, creating favorable conditions for surviving the summer famine. The Guo Dengbang mutual aid group in Biyun Village, Maqiu Township, held a meeting to discuss the issue of "economizing to prevent famine" during rice transplanting and decided not to eat and drink extravagantly as in previous years during rice transplanting. As a result, the whole group saved two piculs and four pecks of broad beans and drove the farmers in the whole village to save more than twenty piculs of broad beans. They reflected: "In the past, it was 'the rice is yellow, but we starve,' but this year we are not afraid because we have things to prevent famine." The Lai Shaozhang mutual aid group in Junji Village, Shaping Township, also saved more than 300,000 yuan, which can maintain the lives of the whole group for one month. (Yang Shaopu)

    四川富顺县各级干部领导群众预防夏荒
    深入群众了解具体情况解决具体问题
    四川省富顺县各级领导干部接受了在春耕生产中忽视领导群众渡荒的教训，在插秧中就响亮地提出了“节约防荒，储粮备荒”的口号，积极领导群众生产自救防备夏荒。现在，某些有历史性灾荒的地区已制止了夏荒的发展，并可逐步战胜夏荒。
    大部区乡干部在四月下旬，都对夏荒情况作了典型调查，初步做到心中有底，摸清了夏荒的情况、根源，认识了夏荒日益发展对生产的危害性。据全县山区五十二个村的统计，从插秧到秋收要缺粮三十天到四十天的有一千六百零二户，占总户数的三分之一左右。当时夏荒才开始露头，因为今年春荒严重，蚕豆、豌豆歉收，去年秋季收成又差，估计夏荒发展日益严重的可能性是很大的。为了制止夏荒的发展，领导群众胜利渡过夏荒，县里在四、五月份内先后重点总结了春荒情况，摸了夏荒的底。各区乡发动群众自找副业窍门，已有副业基础的地区着重研究提高副业产品的品质规格，扩大销路；缺少副业的地区发动群众大家找，从本区本乡找，邻区邻乡找，找一点作一点，找一处作一处。同时深入宣传贯彻自由借贷的政策，发动群众互助互济，渡过困难。中共富顺九区区委书记孙科玉、区长周继秋等都深入乡村了解具体情况，解决具体问题，使缺粮户也作到了满栽满插。富顺各地都贯彻了“生产自救”的方针，广泛宣传发展农业生产的政策，及时地解除了群众单纯依赖政府救济的思想。九区将缺粮户分成三种类型，排队后具体解决：一、把有劳力的组成运输小组，与合作社订合同搞运输，共解决了三十五户人的生活困难。二、把缺劳力的组织起来搞有销路的副业，主要是编“包子”。中和乡万民村共产党员陈星海并主动地和该村缺粮户订了“包教包学合同”，使全村缺粮户在十天内全学会了编“包子”。三、年老无劳力不能搞副业的，则由政府贷款救济。多数区乡领导都重视了副业产品的销路问题，供销合作社也密切配合了这个工作。
    在宣传与贯彻自由借贷的政策时，各地都针对有余粮户的思想顾虑，进行了耐心的说服教育，并处理了过去旧有的债务问题，做到了“自愿借出，利息互相协商”。富和乡甘少华互助组组员林汉清（中农）在一九五一、一九五二年先后借出了十二石多谷子未收回，以前贫雇农认为“到了穷人手，要得穷人有”，拖延不还，干部也不理。因此他虽听了宣传自由借贷的政策，仍然一颗余粮也不愿再借出。乡里干部了解这一情况后，立即对借了谷子未还的贫雇农进行了教育，说明借了人家的东西应该还给人家，有借有还，再借不难；一般借了谷子的贫雇农也认识到借了不还是不对的，自己虽然困难，但不能失掉信用，因此，他们都纷纷表示愿分期分批的连本带利一齐还清。如雇农简绍清在一九五一年借了林汉清五斗谷子，一直拖着不还，但经教育懂得了政策后，他就自觉自愿地表示在今年秋收后连本带利一齐还清。经过宣传解释政策和处理旧债问题后，林汉清又自愿借出了二石多谷子，使他们互助组做到了满栽满插。
    由于从上而下地贯彻了“节约防荒，储粮备荒”的精神，很多农民打破了旧有的习惯，在插秧中节省了大批粮食为渡夏荒创造了有利条件。马丘乡碧云村郭登榜互助组在插秧时开会讨论了“节约防荒”问题，决定栽秧时不像往年一样大吃大喝。因此，全组节约了二石四斗蚕豆，并带动了全村农民节约了二十多石蚕豆，他们反映：“往年是‘谷子黄，饿断肠’，今年有了防荒的东西就不怕了。”沙坪乡均吉村赖少章互助组也同样节约了三十多万元，可维持全组一月的生活。　（杨绍浦）
