Student Health Problems Should Be Seriously Valued
——A Summary of Readers' Letters

    Recently, we have received many letters from readers reflecting that the health of students in secondary and higher education institutions in some areas is generally declining. A survey conducted by Huaian Normal School in northern Jiangsu at the end of last year showed that only 11.7% of students were in normal health. At the Anhui University Agricultural College, 7% of students suffered from lung disease. At the Nanchang University Engineering College, over 20% of second-year students in the Civil Engineering Department suffered from insomnia. At Tianjin University, 30% of all students suffered from arthritis, and stomach problems, insomnia, and headaches were even more common.

    The readers’ letters indicate that the reasons for this serious situation are:

    1.  The food is too poor, leading to student malnutrition. A letter from students at Guangzhou Industrial School states: “We eat very thin porridge for breakfast every day and have to attend classes starting at 5:00 AM. By the third period, we feel dizzy, tired, and extremely hungry. When lunchtime finally arrives, we want to eat our fill, but often there isn't enough food, and some students can only eat half-full. Students generally lose weight after coming to the school, which affects their health.” A letter from students at Pingyuan Normal College states: “The students, workers, and police officers who eat in the large canteen often have bean curd soup, green radishes, vermicelli, and yellowed spinach. Even these things are in small quantities. Last semester, we could eat meat twice a week on average, but this semester it's only once, and each person can barely get a piece.” Students at Ganzhou Normal School eat as if they are抢饭(qiang3 fan4:抢饭 is a local term meaning to scramble for food), and some students can't eat enough if they eat slowly. Why does the above phenomenon occur? The most common reason is poor food management. For example, a letter from students at the Central University of Finance and Economics states: "Our monthly food expenses are 100,000 yuan, which would allow us to eat relatively well in other schools, but there is serious waste in our school's food management. The canteen operators always prepare food for 1,300 people every day, regardless of whether the number of diners decreases; the uneaten food is wasted.” Many students in their letters also reflect that flies, mosquitoes, sand, nails, rat droppings, and even rats or rags have been found in the food at their schools’ canteens. Many school administrative leaders leave the food work to the management personnel and do not regularly care about or inspect it. Many students raise opinions about the food management, but the leaders do not pay attention to them. In addition, regional price differences in individual areas also affect student food. For example, the Northeast Administrative Committee Education Bureau stated in its reply to this newspaper: Although students in colleges and universities in Northeast China have more than 90,000 yuan of food expenses per month, they can only eat less than one-third of refined grains per week on average. Most schools can only eat two meals of porridge and one meal of dry rice per day. Vegetables are expensive and scarce, and they can only eat meat once a week on average, with each person averaging only two or three liang.

    2.  Excessive coursework and extracurricular activities also affect student health. For example, a letter from students at Guangzhou Industrial School states: “Including reading newspapers and self-study, we study for a total of ten hours a day. Many students become dizzy and exhausted.” A letter from students at Tangshan Railway College states: “Including the collective current affairs study at 3:00 PM, we study for nearly 60 hours a week. The calculation of study hours is also unreasonable. Therefore, we don't even have time to write letters, see a doctor, or wash clothes. We are always very tense from 6:30 AM to 10:30 PM.” In some schools, teachers assign too much and too heavy homework, and many students cannot complete it on time and have to sacrifice rest time. A letter from students at Nanjing No. 1 Middle School states that they study for 11 hours a day and can only sleep for 7 hours. Readers from Jinzhou Municipal High School reflect that the extracurricular homework assigned by the school’s teachers is too deep and too difficult, which not only causes students to have “indigestion” of their coursework but also squeezes out students’ rest time, resulting in increased absences due to illness and impacting health. A letter from readers at Nanchang Normal School reflects that the school has many meetings, with as many as 16 hours of meetings in one week. Some schools have even canceled morning exercises in order to implement new teaching systems.

    3.  The sanitary environment in some schools is too poor, and the medical and healthcare work is not good. For example, a letter from students in the Chemistry Department of Central China Higher Normal School states:
    “More than 50 students in our school have lung disease. The students have suggested that the school's administrative leaders find a way to separate the dormitories of students with lung disease from those of healthy students, but the leaders have refused, citing housing difficulties. More than 60 students in the Chemistry Department live in a small 'large dormitory,' with very little space to walk. The air in the dormitory is very bad, making it very easy to spread disease. The students have been asking to improve this situation since last autumn, but there have been no results until now.” A letter from students at Beijing Institute of Iron and Steel Technology states that 600 to 700 people live in one dormitory, and the air is extremely polluted. Many schools, such as Sunan Industrial College, have similar situations. The area around the canteen and dormitories of Ganzhou Normal School is extremely dirty and smells bad, but the school's leaders turn a blind eye. More than 800 students at Sanyuan Industrial School in Shaanxi eat in the square, and when the wind blows, yellow sand fills the entire dining area. The students asked to build a mat shed, but the Shaanxi Provincial Department of Culture and Education does not care. Many students' letters reflect that there are too few lights in their school's classrooms, reading rooms, and dormitories, and the brightness is too weak, making it inconvenient to study at night and affecting their eyesight. A letter from students at Pingyuan Normal College states: "The medical equipment in our college is extremely simple. The doctors don't examine patients carefully, and they often prescribe medicine before the students have finished explaining their condition.” A letter from readers at Youren Middle School in Ningxiang County, Hunan Province, states that the school's original school doctor had very poor skills. When students went to see him, he would say that they had "caught a cold" in winter and that they had "caught heatstroke" in summer. When students went to get medicine at night, he would sometimes let the students take it themselves. After the teachers and students of the school raised their opinions, a new school doctor was hired this semester, but he was a mentally ill patient who could not work and left after a few days. Now, this school with 388 students does not even have a school doctor.

    In order to improve the health of students and ensure the successful completion of learning tasks, the education departments of local people's governments and school leaders should pay serious attention to the above situations and take practical and effective measures to improve them.

### 应该切实重视学生健康问题——读者来信综述

    应该切实重视学生健康问题
    ——读者来信综述
    最近我们收到很多读者来信，反映某些地区的中等以上学校学生健康状况普遍下降。苏北淮安师范学校在去年年底调查统计，健康情况正常的学生仅占百分之十一点七；安徽大学农学院患肺病的学生占百分之七；南昌大学工学院土木系二年级学生患失眠症的占百分之二十以上；天津大学全校学生患关节炎的占百分之三十，患胃病、失眠、头痛的更为普遍。
    从读者来信反映的情况中可以看出，造成这种严重情况的原因是：
    一、伙食太差，学生营养不良。广州工业学校学生来信说：“我们每天吃了很稀的早饭，要上五点钟的课，第三节课开始，就头晕、疲倦，饿得发慌了。熬到吃中午饭时，想饱吃一顿；但时常饭不够吃，有些同学只能吃到半饱。同学们来校后体重普遍减轻，健康受到影响。”平原师范学院学生来信说：“我们参加大灶用膳的同学、工警，经常吃的是豆沫汤、青萝卜、粉条和发了黄的菠菜等；就是这些东西数量也很少。上学期我们每周平均可吃到两餐肉，这一学期只有一餐了，而且每人差不多只能吃到一块。”赣州师范学校学生吃饭像抢饭一样，有些学生吃慢了就吃不饱。为什么会发生上述现象呢？最普遍的原因是伙食管理不善。如中央财经学院学生的来信中说：“我们伙食费每月是十万元，在别的学校是可以吃得比较好的；但我们学校伙食管理工作中有严重的浪费现象。膳团经办人不管吃饭人数是否减少，每天总是做一千三百人的饭菜；吃不完的就糟塌了。”许多学校的学生在来信中还反映了他们学校学生膳团的饭菜里面曾发现有苍蝇、蚊子、砂土、钉子、老鼠粪，甚至老鼠或抹布等脏物。很多学校的行政领导方面将伙食工作交给管理人员后就算了事，并不经常关心和检查。不少学生对伙食管理情况提出意见，领导方面也不加重视。此外，个别地区因物价的地区差价关系，也影响了学生伙食。如东北行政委员会教育局在答复本报的信中说：东北各高等学校学生每人每月虽有九万多元的伙食费，但每周平均吃不到三分之一的细粮，多数学校每天只能吃两餐稀饭、一餐干饭；蔬菜价贵而且缺少，每周平均只能吃一次肉，每人平均不过二、三两。
    二、课业过重，课外活动过多，也影响了学生健康。如广州工业学校学生来信说：“我们每天连读报、自习在内，共学习十个钟点。好多同学弄得头晕、疲倦不堪。”唐山铁道学院学生来信说：“我们连三点钟集体时事学习在内，每周学习就将近六十小时；学时计算也不合理。因此我们连写信、看病、洗衣服的时间都没有。从早上六点三十分到晚上十点三十分总是非常紧张。”有些学校由于教师布置的课外作业太多、太重，许多学生不能按时完成，不得不牺牲休息时间。南京市第一中学学生来信说，他们每天学习达十一小时，睡眠只能有七小时。锦州市立高级中学读者反映，该校教师指定的课外作业过深过难，不但使学生们课业“消化不良”，并且使学生们休息时间被挤掉，以致影响健康，因病缺席者大为增加。南昌师范学校读者来信反映，该校会议很多，有一个星期中甚至开会达十六小时之多。有的学校因为要实行新教学制度，将广播体操也取消了。
    三、有些学校卫生环境太差，医疗、保健工作情况不好。如华中高等师范学校化学科学生来信说：
    “我校患肺病的同学已有五十余人。同学们曾建议学校行政领导方面设法将患肺病的同学和健康的同学的宿舍分开，但领导方面藉口房屋困难，不予解决。化学科六十多个同学住在一个狭小的‘大寝室’里，连走路的空隙都很小，寝室里空气很坏，非常容易传染疾病。同学从去秋即要求改善这种情况，但直到现在还没有结果。”北京钢铁工业学院学生来信说，该校六、七百人住在一个寝室，空气异常污浊。苏南工专等许多学校也有类似情况。赣州师范学校学生膳堂、寝室周围极为肮脏，臭气四溢，但学校领导方面熟视无睹。陕西三原工业学校八百多学生在广场上吃饭，刮大风时黄沙弥漫整
    个饭场；学生要求搭一个席棚，陕西省文教厅也不管。许多学校的学生来信反映，他们学校的教室、阅览室、寝室中电灯数量既少，光度又弱，晚间学习时很不方便，还影响视力。平原师范学院学生来信说：“我院医药设备极为简陋。大夫看病又不仔细，往往同学还没说完病情，药方就开好了。”湖南宁乡县友仁中学读者来信说，该校原来的校医技术很差，学生们去看病，在冬天他就说是“受了寒”，在夏天他就说是“受了热”。学生们晚上去领药，他有时就让学生自己拿。经该校师生提出意见，本学期换了一个校医，却是一个精神病患者，无法工作，几天就走了。现在这个有着三百八十八个学生的学校，连一个校医也没有了。
    为改进学生健康状况，保证学习任务的胜利完成，各地人民政府教育部门和学校领导方面对以上情况均应引起严重的注意，并采取切实有效的办法予以改善。
