Inexhaustible Potential
——New Achievements in the Promotion of New Farming Methods in Zhaoyuan County

"Not enough labor"
After last year's practical experience, the farmers of Zhaoyuan County fully believed that the new farming method of "equal distance, wide sowing, thinning, seedling preservation, and staged topdressing" was the key to increasing production. However, they still had concerns, fearing that there would not be enough labor to implement the new farming method.

The Zhaoyuan County Party Committee believed that solving the problem of labor consumption was the key to consolidating and improving the new farming method this year. At that time, the farmers' reasons were as follows: various crops emerged almost at the same time, and because of the lack of labor, they could not take care of both millet and soybeans when thinning. According to this situation, the County Party Committee initially studied: if the sowing time could be arranged sequentially according to the habits of various crops, so that their germination period would be slightly staggered, the contradiction of thinning time squeezed together could be solved. Therefore, the County Party Committee sent Propaganda Minister Shi Kaihui to Mengkeli Village for experimentation; if feasible, it would be promoted throughout the county.

Shi Kaihui went to Mengkeli Village to further understand the farmers' distress over "labor consumption." Last year, the village thinned 223 hectares and topdressed 365 hectares, using a total of 5,530 female labor days; 161 women in the village worked for nearly 40 days, but many of them did not meet the technical specifications. This year, it is planned to thin 280 hectares and topdress 400 hectares; if calculated according to last year's labor days, 7,530 female labor days will be required, and the working time will be longer than last year. However, in order not to affect the development of seedlings, all crops must be thinned within 20 days. Therefore, the masses of farmers said: "Time is too tight, and there is not enough labor."

Speaking of thinning seedlings, the women of Mengkeli Village have a deep impression. Last year, when thinning for the first time, everyone had no experience. No one knew how far apart a seedling should be. Some farmers were afraid of thinning their crops badly, so after thinning the first time, they went to check it in a few days. The seedlings were still dense, so they thinned them again. However, the millet had already taken root, and it was difficult to pull it out; sometimes when pulling out this seedling, the next one would move, so they had to pull this one with their right hand and cultivate that one with their left hand. After thinning the millet twice, it was already mid-July, and the soybeans were more than a foot high and had already blossomed, so it was not suitable to thin them again. The most difficult thing was that the millet was sown thickly last year, densely like horsehair, and they didn't know which seedling to pull. If they were not careful, they would break many seedlings. Therefore, last year, it took an average of 15 labor days per hectare of millet to thin.

Potential is tapped
The Zhaoyuan County Party Committee found the direction to solve the problem of labor consumption from these situations. One of the reasons for labor consumption was that they had no experience last year and the millet was planted thickly, making it difficult to thin, but the main reason was that in the past, farmers rarely had a thorough and unified plan for planting, so they planted casually, resulting in busy and wasteful work. The same was true in mutual aid teams. Today, the Li family wants to plant sorghum, and tomorrow, the Luo family wants to plant millet. As a result, everyone wants to be hoed first, and no one is willing to give way. Because being hoed one day later will make a big difference! If this problem cannot be solved, everyone will do their own thing. In the past, the mutual aid team rotation system was not successful for this reason. Last year, after thinning millet twice in Mengkeli Village, the soybeans were already more than a foot high. This year, to further promote the new farming method, it is necessary to "stagger planting."

When Shi Kaihui returned from Mengkeli Village, the county was preparing to convene a rural work conference; therefore, Mengkeli Village's "staggered planting" plan was used as a typical example for full research and discussion. Mengkeli Village's plan was formulated as follows: wheat should be planted by Qingming Festival, millet should be planted within ten days after Qingming Festival, sorghum and millet should be planted during Guyu, soybeans should be planted within ten days after Guyu, and corn should be planted by the beginning of summer; at this time, there are still one month and two days left until Mangzhong, which will be used as time for replanting and transplanting. By Mangzhong, it is estimated that the millet will also grow to more than an inch high, and a one-time fixed seedling method will be adopted to thin the millet in ten days. After thinning the millet, it will be time to thin the soybeans (planned for five days), and thinning sorghum will begin at the summer solstice. This will not only stagger the thinning time, but also solve the rotation problem. Whoever's land sprouts first will be hoeed first, and everyone will have no objection.

Educate farmers with facts
New budding things are often difficult to grow at the beginning. In order to "stagger planting" without delaying the agricultural season, it is necessary to sow early. However, when the Fourth District Committee mobilized the Shen Jie group in Fuxing Village to sow early, some farmers said: "Sow wheat busily during Qingming, and sow the fields during Guyu, this is the old rule." When mentioning sowing millet during Qingming Festival, the masses were even more worried. Old Fengtou of Weixin Village in the Twelfth District said in front of the comrades of the county work team: "I won't plant it even if you cut off my head, I've never heard of sowing millet during Qingming Festival." Others also said: "Sow millet only after sowing sorghum." When asked why, he said: "Early sowing is afraid of freezing, and will produce weeds and old seedlings (stalks that do not bear ears)." Similar problems were encountered in other districts when mobilizing early sowing and staggered sowing. Is it really harmful to sow millet early? The Fourth District Committee heard that Qu Fengwu, a farmer in the district, planted millet three days before Qingming last year, and it grew very tall and had large ears. Each hectare yielded several more stones than others. Jin Fenghua and Li He, farmers in Weixin Village in the Twelfth District, both sowed millet during Qingming in the past two years. Not only were they not frozen, but also during the flood last autumn, their millet had already matured. There was not a single weed, and it averaged more than nine stones per small hectare. Of course, some of the early-sown ones also grew weeds and old seedlings. But that was because the seeds were not properly treated when planting. Some farmers were afraid that the early-sown ones would not sprout, so they desperately sowed more seeds, so that the seedlings squeezed their heads when they sprouted. In the past, they were not accustomed to thinning seedlings, and the seedlings were too dense, so they used hoes to try to loosen the seedling eyes, resulting in damage to the roots of the seedlings, which produced old seedlings. The reason for weeds was mainly that the millet chaff from the previous year fell on the ground and sprouted at a suitable temperature. The work team promptly used these facts to educate the farmers and mobilized Party members, League members, labor models, and cadres to take the lead in sowing, and then launched a competition craze from point to point through visits and competitions. Dou Guangsheng, a labor model in the Second District, sowed millet on March 28, and achieved good results. Leading cadres organized more than 50 people to visit. Before the visit, the masses generally said: "It's too early to sow." After visiting the field, they realized that it was not too early. The next day, three more groups continued to plow. This gradually promoted the entire district.

There are tricks within tricks
It is not enough to just educate the masses to recognize the benefits of early sowing, it is also necessary to solve some specific problems that occur at any time. Five days before Qingming, when agricultural technician Shi Fengming went to Mengkeli Village, Li Yunjian Agricultural Production Cooperative raised such a specific problem: the cooperative has 75 hectares of land, 260 carts of manure have not been sent out, 30 hectares of stubble have not been picked and plowed, and eight houses must be renovated. The cooperative has a total of 21 male laborers and 19 female laborers. According to this situation, plowing cannot be started until Guyu at the earliest. In this way, the "staggered planting" plan cannot be realized. The members were all staring at each other, anxious but helpless. At this time, Shi Fengming remembered the "side-cutting, side-picking, side-planting" farming method and the continuous operation method using new agricultural tools recently summarized by the County Party Committee in Dou Guangsheng Mutual Aid Group in the Third District, and felt confident, so he asked them in return: "When do you usually plant in the past?" The members replied: "Every year, we plow the stubble first, and then plant after sending out the manure." Shi Fengming said: "If we mobilize both male and female labor this year, and coordinate the manpower, can we plow the stubble and plant at the same time?" Fu Baoshan, the deputy director of the cooperative, suddenly realized after hearing this question, and immediately said: "Yes, isn't that continuous operation?" Ruan Xiucheng, a member, still didn't understand; he asked: "How do you connect it?" Fu Baoshan said: "Our cooperative has one stubble cutting machine, two steel shaft carts, plus labor and animal power to cut the stubble, women pick on the side, then planting, filtering manure, and rolling with a roller." Zhang Zhongkui said as soon as he heard it: "It's okay, but it will take a lot of people!" Everyone calculated: the stubble cutting machine uses one person and two horses, picking stubble uses 16 women, sending manure uses two carts, four people, and eight horses, planting uses two plows, all using eight people, and rolling with a roller uses one person, a total of 14 male laborers and 16 female laborers are needed. With this calculation, the cooperative still has three women, seven male laborers, and four horses left. Originally, everyone was worried that there was not enough labor and it was impossible to plant early, but now they were all happy and said: "This is really a trick." They went to the field the next day. After experimenting for a day, an average of two plows planted three hectares, 16 women picked three and a half hectares of stubble, and two carts sent 15 carts of manure. The 30 hectares of stubble can be planted in about ten days. Other people will build houses and engage in sideline businesses. Everyone in the village inside and outside thought this was a rare thing, and praised: "It's good to be organized!" That night, the whole cooperative went back to have a discussion. There are three major advantages to doing this: (1) It can resist drought. In the past, after pulling the stubble and filtering the manure, then planting, the stubble pits were often dry to more than two inches deep; now, planting while cutting ensures that the seeds are planted on wet soil, and germination is fast and good. (2) They can help each other, check each other, reduce wasted work, and improve quality. (3) It can expand the scope of women's participation in labor.

This is the "five-side operation" method of side-cutting, side-picking, side-planting, side-filtering, and side-rolling promoted by Zhaoyuan County in qualified groups and cooperatives. Eleven groups and two cooperatives in Mengkeli Village all implemented this method, promoting 110 women in the village to go to the fields to pick stubble. This was not the case in the spring of the past. "Staggered planting" and "five-side operation method," these tricks may not be applicable everywhere, and it is already too late to use them now. However, the spirit of the Zhaoyuan County Party Committee to constantly study problems starting from the needs of the masses is worth learning.

    挖不尽的潜力
    ——肇源县推广新耕作法中的新成就
    胡佩兰
    “劳力不够用”
    肇源县农民经过去年的实际体验，充分相信了“等距、宽播、间苗、保苗、分期追肥”的新耕作法是增产的关键。但是他们还有顾虑，害怕实行新耕作法时劳力不足。
    肇源县委认为：解决费工问题是今年巩固和提高新耕作法的关键。当时农民提的理由是这样：各种作物差不多都同时出苗，因为劳力不足，间苗时顾了谷子就顾不了大豆。根据这种情况，县委初步研究了一下：如果根据各种作物的习性，循序排列播种时间，使它们的发芽期稍稍错开，就可解决间苗时间挤在一起的矛盾。于是，县委派宣传部长石凯会到孟克里村去作试验；如果可行，就在全县范围内推广。
    石凯会到孟克里村进一步了解了农民对“费工”的苦闷。去年该村间苗二百二十三垧，追肥三百六十五垧，总共用妇女工五千五百三十个；全村一百六十一名妇女作了将近四十天活，但在技术规格上还有很多不合乎要求。今年计划间苗二百八十垧，追肥四百垧；如果按去年的工数计算，要用七千五百三十个妇女工，作活的时间还要比去年长。可是，为了不使小苗发育受影响，全部庄稼必须在二十天以内间完。因此，农民群众说：时间不赶趟，劳力不够用。
    谈起间苗的事，孟克里村妇女的印象可深了。去年初间苗，大家都没有经验。到底是多远一棵合适，人们都不知道。有些农民生怕把他的庄稼间瞎了，因此，头一次间完了苗，过不几天就去看看。苗子还密，又间一次。但是，谷子已经盘根，再拔就费事了；有时拔这棵，旁边那棵又移动了，只好右手拔这棵，左手培着那棵。谷子间过二遍苗，已七月中旬了，黄豆长了一尺多高，已经开了花，再间就不相宜了。最困难的是去年谷子播得厚，密密麻麻像马鬃似的，不知拔那棵好，稍一不慎，就要碰折很多棵。所以，去年间苗时，平均每垧谷子用了十五个工。
    潜力挖出来了
    肇源县委从这些情况中找出了解决费工问题的方向。费工的原因之一，固然是去年没有经验，谷子种得厚，不好间苗，但是最主要的还是因为过去农民种地很少有个周密统一的计划，随便种地，所以忙乱窝工。互助组里也是如此。今天老李家要种高粱，明天老罗家要种谷子，结果，铲?时都要求给自己先铲，谁也不肯让步。因为晚铲一天，就差好大成色呢！这个问题解决不了，就各干各的。往年互助组轮作制度搞不好，原因也在这里。去年孟克里村谷子间完二遍，黄豆已长了一尺多高。今年要进一步推广新耕作法，就必须“排开种”。
    石凯会从孟克里村回来的时候，县里正在筹备召开农村工作会议；于是就以孟克里村的“排开种”的计划为典型，作了充分的研究和讨论。孟克里村的计划是这样订的：清明节种完小麦，清明节后十天内种完谷子，谷雨种完高粱和糜子，谷雨后十天种完大豆，立夏种完苞米；这时离芒种还有一个月零两天，就作为补苗和栽苗的时间。到芒种，估计谷子也将长到一寸多高，采用一次定苗办法，以十天的时间间完谷子。间完谷子正好间大豆（计划五天），夏至开始间高粱。这样不但把间苗时间错开，轮作问题也解决了。谁的地先出苗，就先给谁铲，大家都不会有意见。
    用事实教育农民
    新的萌芽的东西，开始生长时往往是困难的。为了不误农时地“排开种”，就必须适当早种。可是，当四区区委在福兴村沈杰小组动员早种时，有的农民就说：“清明忙种麦，谷雨种大田，这是老规矩。”提到清明节种谷子，群众更有顾虑。十二区维新村老冯头当着县工作组同志的面说：“割掉脑袋我也不种，从来我也没听说过清明节种谷子。”其他的人也说：“种完高粱才种谷子。”问他为什么？他说：“早种怕冻着，要出莠子、出老苗子（不出穗的禾秆）。”其他各区在动员早种、排开种时，都遇到相似的问题。到底早种谷子是不是真有害呢？四区区委听说该区农民曲凤梧去年在清明前三天种的谷子，长得很高，穗头很大，每垧地比别人的多打了好几石。十二区维新村农民金凤有和李合在去年、前年都是在清明种谷子，不但没有冻坏，而且在去秋水涝时，他们的谷子已经成熟了，一个莠子也没有，平均每小垧打了九石多。当然，早种的也有长莠子、长老苗子的。但那是因为种的时候处理种籽不恰当。有的农民怕早种的不出苗，拼命多下种籽，以致出苗时都挤破了头。过去又不习惯间苗，苗出的太稠，就用锄头尽量勒苗眼，结果苗的根部受了损伤，就出了老苗子。出莠子的原因主要是头年的谷秕子掉在地里，在适当的温度下出苗了。工作组及时用这些事实教育了农民并且发动党、团员，劳动模范和干部带头播种，然后通过参观和竞赛的方式，由点到面地掀起竞赛热潮。二区劳动模范窦广生在三月二十八日种了谷子，成绩很好。领导干部组织了五十多人去参观。在参观前群众普遍说：
    “种得太早了。”到地参观后，才知道并不早。第二天就有三个组继续开犁。这样逐渐推动了全区。
    窍门里面有窍门
    只是教育群众认识早种的好处，还是不够的，还必须解决随时发生的一些具体问题。清明前五天，农业科技术员石凤鸣到孟克里村去的时候，李云俭农业生产合作社就提出了这样一个具体问题：全社七十五垧地，有二百六十车粪没有送出去，三十垧楂子没有拣、没有刨，还有八间房子必须翻盖。全社共二十一个男劳力、十九个女劳力。照这种情况，最早也得到谷雨才能开犁。这样，“排开种”的计划也就无法实现了。社员都大眼瞪小眼，干着急没办法。这时石凤鸣想起了县委最近在三区窦广生互助组总结出的“边割、边拣、边种”的耕作法和使用新农具的连续作业法，心中有了底，就反问他们：“往年你们都啥时种呢？”社员回答：“每年是先刨好楂子，送完粪才种。”石凤鸣说：“如果今年把男女劳动力都发动起来，人马都配合好，刨楂子种地同时进行，行不行？”社的副主任傅宝山听这样一问，恍然大悟，马上说：“行呀，那不是连续作业吗？”社员阮秀成这时还有些不懂；问：“你怎样连呢？”傅宝山说：“咱社有一台割楂机，两台钢轴车，加上劳动力、畜力割楂子，妇女在一边拣，随后种的种，滤粪的滤粪，压磙的压磙。”张中奎一听，说：“行是行，这可得要很多人啦！”大伙算一算：割楂子机用一个人、两匹马，拣楂子用十六个妇女，送粪用两辆车、四个人、八匹马，种地两付犁杖全部用八个人，压磙子一个人，共需要十四个男劳动力，十六个女劳动力。这样一算，全社还剩下了三个妇女、七个男劳动力、四匹马。原来都愁着劳动力不够用，无法早种地，现在都乐了，说：“这真是个窍门。”第二天他们就下了地。试验了一天，平均两付犁种三垧，十六名妇女拣三垧半楂子，两个车送十五车粪，十天左右三十垧耲楂可全部种完。其他的人就盖房子、搞副业。村里村外都认为这是稀罕事，赞叹地说：“还是组织起来好！”当天晚上全社回去座谈了一下，这样做有三大优点：（一）能抗旱。往年拉完楂子、滤完粪再种，楂子坑往往旱进二寸多深；现在边割边种，种籽正好点在湿土上，发芽又快又好。（二）可以互相帮助，互相检查，减少窝工，提高质量。
    （三）可以扩大妇女参加劳动的范围。
    这就是肇源县在有条件的组、社推广的边割、边拣、边种、边滤、边镇压的“五边作业”法。孟克里村十一个组、两个社全部实行这种办法，推动了全村一百一十名妇女下地拣楂子。这是往年春天所没有的。 “排开种”“五边作业法”，这些窍门不一定各地都适用，而且现在要用也已经晚了。但是，肇源县委处处从群众要求出发，不断地钻研问题的精神是值得学习的。
