Mobilize the Masses, Implement Strict Systems to Correct Waste of Timber
--Reader Letters and Commentary

    Since the Central People's Government Administrative Council issued the "Instructions on Conserving Timber," many regions and timber-using units across the country have been earnestly implementing it and have made certain achievements. In new construction projects of industrial departments in the Northeast, ordinary houses generally do not use wood for floors and floorboards, thus reducing timber consumption by 10 percent per square meter of construction area compared to the past. The Beipiao Mining Bureau, by strengthening pit prop recovery and adopting "finished supports," saved 1,382 cubic meters of timber in five months. A factory under the Fushun Mining Bureau replaced non-returnable crates with reusable crates for packaging products, saving 1,300 cubic meters of timber in a year. Many enterprises used bamboo and grass materials instead of wooden boards to package goods, thereby achieving certain results in reducing timber consumption. However, it should also be pointed out that not all regions and timber-using units have conscientiously implemented the Administrative Council's instructions. Timber management in many places remains very chaotic, and many units still have serious waste in timber use.

    Recently, reader letters from various places have provided us with many distressing facts in this regard. For example, the timber required by various agencies and enterprises in Beijing is uniformly reviewed and allocated by the Municipal People's Government Finance and Economics Committee, and settlement procedures are handled by the Municipal Finance Bureau. Because most timber-using units apply for allocations with a "better to be generous than lacking" attitude, and the responsible units mentioned above have not strictly reviewed the applications, the amount of timber accumulated in various units is now very large. The Beijing Municipal Finance Bureau alone has accumulated 3,000 cubic meters of matured pine timber, and much of it has begun to rot due to prolonged storage. Furthermore, last year, the supply of creosoted railway ties in the Northeast was less than one-fifth of the required amount; however, the existing creosoting equipment capacity was not fully utilized, and it is estimated that 2 million more railway ties could have been creosoted last year. If these railway ties were creosoted, their service life could be extended from six or seven years to about fifteen years, and these 2 million railway ties could be used to lay more than 1,200 kilometers of railway (equivalent to two Chengdu-Chongqing Railways). Such waste is appalling! The phenomenon of using large timber for small purposes and using high-quality timber for inferior purposes is even more widespread and serious. The 301 Construction Site in the Northeast, due to poor planning, sawed 11-centimeter boards into 8-centimeter boards. The 303 Construction Site sawed 10-meter-long timber into 5-meter-long timber. The Heilongjiang Local Industry Bureau's timber factory used red pine logs to saw box boards; while the box boards cut from veneer by the former Northeast Forestry Department's timber factory were stockpiled for a long time and eventually rotted. The Huangguatun Railway Factory uses 40,000 cubic meters of timber annually. Because the supplied logs do not meet the specifications, much of the sapwood is wasted during processing. The Huanglong Logging Farm in Shaanxi felled 3,000 cubic meters of mine supports, but only more than 400 cubic meters met the specifications. The remaining 2,500 cubic meters were either not long enough or exceeded the diameter specifications. What is infuriating is that these mine supports were all short wooden pillars cut from long timber. They are not suitable for mine supports, and have even fewer uses for other purposes.

    There are many reasons why timber waste is still so common and serious, and the situation is also extremely complex. But the main reason is that timber-using departments do not have a sufficient understanding of the political significance of timber conservation, mistakenly believing that timber is a "natural product" that can be "taken inexhaustibly," and they neither conduct publicity and education on "timber conservation" for their employees nor provide effective inspection and supervision. When using timber, they "take it as they please and cut it arbitrarily." The timber management and allocation departments have long been "clueless." For example, how much timber does Beijing need each year? What kind of timber? How much for construction? How much for furniture? What is the timber processing capacity? These are not precisely grasped by Beijing's timber management and allocation departments. As for which type of timber is most suitable for which purpose, even less research is done. In addition, there is a gap between the timber production season and the demand season, and sometimes the supply lags behind the demand. This has led to the long-term failure to completely overcome the phenomenon of timber waste. It should be pointed out that timber is one of the indispensable and important materials in national construction. Currently, China does not have too much timber available for construction, but rather not enough. Therefore, the seriousness of timber waste lies in the fact that it will directly affect the rapid progress of China's construction work.

    In order to change the above situation, readers suggest:

    1. All timber-using units should vigorously publicize the great significance of timber conservation to their employees: Designers and on-site timber users should be educated not to start solely from aesthetics and ease of operation during design and material allocation, and to cherish timber as much as they cherish hardware materials. On-site timber processing personnel should be required to comprehensively consider the specifications and quantity of timber used for the entire project, and to precisely coordinate the combination of long and short timber for unified cutting to reduce waste.

    2. The unified timber management agencies in each city and unit should grasp the specifications and plans of timber required by each timber-using unit, strengthen research on the rational use of timber, grasp the production of each related timber factory, and gradually implement comprehensive timber processing and unified distribution of components. Last year, a certain engineering office in the Northeast centrally processed more than 40,000 door and window parts for seven projects and then sent them to various construction sites for installation, thus saving more than 5,000 cubic meters of timber. This is a successful example worth learning from.

    3. The timber stockpiled in various units should be cleaned up in a timely manner, and the behavior of serious timber waste should be inspected and dealt with. Through these cleanups and inspections, the important significance of timber conservation should be conveyed to the masses so that the broad masses are mobilized. Only in this way can we guarantee the victorious completion of the arduous task of "conserving timber."

### 发动群众，严格制度纠正浪费木材的现象——读者来信述评

专栏：读者来信摘要

    发动群众，严格制度纠正浪费木材的现象
    ——读者来信述评
    自从中央人民政府政务院颁发“关于节约木材的指示”以后，全国许多地区和用材单位都已在认真执行，并且作出一定的成绩。东北各工业部门的新建工程，一般的房屋都不用木材做地板和楼板，因而每平方公尺建筑面积，比以往少用百分之十的木材。北票矿务局由于加强坑木回收和采用“成品棚子”，五个月中节约木材一千三百八十二立方公尺；抚顺矿务局某厂以活板箱代替死板箱包装产品，一年中节省木材一千三百立方公尺；许多企业单位利用竹料和草料代替木板包装商品，因而在减少木材消耗方面也获得一定的成绩。但还应该指出，并不是所有地区和用材单位都认真负责地贯彻了政务院的指示。不少地方在木材管理上仍然十分混乱，不少单位在用材方面还有严重的浪费现象。
    最近，各地读者来信便在这方面给我们提供了许多令人痛心的事实。如北京市各机关企业所需木材，是由市人民政府财政经济委员会统一批审、调拨，由市财政局办理结算等手续。由于各用材单位申请调拨木材时大多数是“宽打窄用”和“宁多勿缺”，而以上负责单位也未严加审查，以致现在各单位所积存的木材为数甚多。仅北京市财政局便积存松木成材达三千立方公尺，不少木材因为积存时间太久，已经开始腐烂。又如去年东北已经进行防腐的枕木还不够供应量的五分之一；但现有防腐设备能力并未充分运用，据估计去年还可防腐枕木二百万根。这些枕木如果经过防腐，使用年限可以由六、七年延长到十五年左右，而这二百万根枕木可以铺设铁路一千二百余公里（相当于两条成渝铁路）。这样的浪费是惊人的！至于大材小用和优材劣用的现象则更加普遍而严重。东北三○一工地由于计划不周，把十一公分的板材锯成八公分。三○三工地把十公尺的长材锯为五公尺。哈尔滨市地方工业局制材厂用红松原木锯制箱板；前东北林业部制材厂用板皮割制的箱板材却长期积压以至腐烂。皇姑屯铁路工厂每年需用木材达四万立方公尺，由于供应的原木规格不符，加工时许多边材都浪费掉。陕西黄龙伐木场伐制了三千立方公尺的矿柱，合规格的仅四百多立方公尺，其余两千五百多立方公尺不是长度不够就是径级超过规格；令人愤慨的是这些矿柱都是由长材截成的短木柱，作矿柱不适用，其他的用途就更少了。
    木材浪费现象所以还这样普遍和严重，原因很多，情形也极复杂。但主要的是用材部门对于节约木材的政治意义认识不足，错误地认为木材是“自然产物”，可以“取之不尽，用之不竭”，既不向职工作“节约木材”的宣传教育，又缺乏切实的检查督促，使用木材时是“随手拿来，任意割制”。而木材的管理调拨部门则长期“心中无数”。譬如，北京市每年究竟需要多少木材？哪一类的材？建筑料用多少？家具料用多少？制材能力有多大？这些，北京市的木材管理调拨部门是没有精确掌握的。至于那一种材作那一种用途最为恰当，则更少研究。再加上木材生产季节和需用季节还有距离，有时供应且落后于需要。这样就造成木材浪费现象长期没有彻底克服。应该指出：木材是国家建设工作中不可缺少的重要材料之一。我国目前可供建设用的木材不是太多，而是不足。因此，浪费木材的严重性，就在于它将直接影响到我国建设工作的迅速进展。
    为了改变上述情况，读者建议：
    一、各用材单位应该大力向职工宣传节约木材的重大意义：应该教育工程设计者和现场用材人员在设计和配料时不要单纯从美观和操作方便出发，珍惜木材应该如同珍惜五金材料一样；对于现场制材人员，应该要求他们综合整个工程用材规格、数量，把长短木料精密配合起来统一截制，以减少浪费。
    二、各城市各单位统一掌握木材的机构，应该掌握各用材单位所需木材的规格和计划，加强研究木材的合理使用，掌握各有关制材厂的生产，逐步实行木材综合加工和统一分配构件。去年东北某工程处把七个工程用的四万多件门、窗零件，集中加工，然后送往各工地安装，因而节省了五千多立方公尺木材。这是一个成功的例子，值得学习。
    三、对各单位所积压的木材，应该适时清理，对严重浪费木材的行为应该加以检查处理。通过这些清理和检查，把节约木材的重要意义贯彻到群众中去，使广大群众都动起来。这样才能保障胜利地完成“节约木材”的艰巨任务。
