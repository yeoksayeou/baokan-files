Xinhua News Agency, 7th: Zhu Yiduo, head of the Indonesian Trade Union delegation who was invited to China to attend the "May Day" celebrations and the Seventh National Congress of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, delivered a radio speech to the Indonesian people in Guangzhou before returning home on the 1st, praising the achievements of New China.

Zhu Yiduo said: We traveled in northern, eastern and southern China, and directly visited labor heroes, farmers, students, national entrepreneurs, and cultural workers. The result of the visit shows that the Chinese working class and the people have carried out tremendous social reforms.

Regarding the situation in rural China, Zhu Yiduo said: China's land reform has been basically completed, and 700 million mu of land have been distributed to farmers. The economic foundation of feudalism has been overthrown, and productivity has been greatly improved. The Chinese People's Government has also built water conservancy projects to prevent floods and control rivers. We have personally seen a prosperous scene in the countryside. Rural productivity is constantly increasing, farmers' purchasing power is constantly growing, and China is now able to export a large amount of agricultural products. We have also seen many cooperatives in the countryside, supplying the needs of farmers. There were more than 36,000 such cooperatives in 1952, and the number has increased greatly now. Primary schools in rural areas have also developed greatly.

Zhu Yiduo then talked about the situation of China's industrial construction, saying: State-owned factories, mines and other industrial departments have completed democratic reforms, and the management system implemented by the reactionary Kuomintang in the past has been completely abolished. The Chinese working class has truly become the master of the factory, and they have fully exerted their enthusiasm and creativity. We have personally seen many large-scale factories manufacturing machines, and the workers are happily engaged in production competitions. Workers' wages continue to rise, in addition to wages for overproduction. Moreover, workers receive government subsidies in medical care, education, culture and other aspects, and even enjoy free services.

Zhu Yiduo also said: We have also seen the tremendous efforts made by New China in cultural construction. Workers, peasants, young people and children are all studying culture very hard. Factories have equipped workers with places for rest, reading, recreational activities and sports activities. Many factories and mines we have seen have their own cultural and art troupes, as do schools and villages. China has also produced many feature films and documentaries; at present, there are nearly 2,000 theatrical troupes across the country, with 200,000 members.

Zhu Yiduo said: The construction undertakings carried out by New China in a very short period of time have surprised the whole world. Now China's first five-year plan for economic construction has begun. This planned economy is aimed at the interests of the people of the whole country. The entire people of New China have demonstrated their enormous capabilities, so the five-year plan must be achievable, and even achievable ahead of schedule.

Zhu Yiduo came to the conclusion that: "Under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong, the Chinese people and the Chinese working class have not only demonstrated their ability to implement the national economic construction plan, but also demonstrated that they have sufficient strength to defend world peace."

In his speech, Zhu Yiduo called on the Indonesian people and the Indonesian working class to strengthen unity, expand and consolidate the national united front, and oppose imperialism.

    印尼总工会代表团团长朱义多在广州发表广播演说
    向印尼人民介绍新中国建设的伟大成就
    【新华社七日讯】应邀来我国参加“五一”节庆祝典礼和中国工会第七次全国代表大会的印尼总工会代表团团长朱义多，返国前于一日在广州向印尼全国人民发表广播演说，赞扬新中国的成就。
    朱义多说：我们在中国旅行了中国的北部、东部和南部，并直接访问了劳动英雄、农民、学生、民族企业家、文化工作者。访问的结果表明，中国的工人阶级和人民进行了极大的社会改革。
    关于中国农村的情形，朱义多说：中国的土地改革已经基本完成，有七亿亩的土地分配给了农民。封建主义的经济基础已被推翻，生产力大大提高。中国人民政府还兴修水利，以防止水灾和控制河流。我们亲眼看到了农村呈现一片繁荣。农村生产力不断提高，农民购买力不断增长，中国已能够有大量农产品输出。我们还看到了农村中的许多合作社，供应着农民的需要。这样的合作社在一九五二年就有了三万六千多个，现在数目还大大增加。农村里的小学校也有了很大发展。
    朱义多接着谈到中国工业建设的情况说：国营厂矿和其他工业部门完成了民主改革，过去反动的国民党所执行的经营制度已被完全取消。中国工人阶级真正成了工厂的主人，他们充分发挥了积极性和创造性。我们亲眼看见了许多大规模制造机器的工厂，工人们正在愉快地进行生产竞赛。工人的工资继续上升，此外还有超额生产所得的工资。而且工人在医疗、教育、文化等各方面都得到政府的补助，甚至可以享受免费。
    朱义多又说：我们也看到了新中国在文化建设方面进行了如何巨大的努力。工人、农民、青年、儿童都非常努力地学习文化。工厂都给工人设备了休息、阅览、文娱活动和体育活动的场所。我们看到的许多厂矿都有了自己的文艺工作团，学校和乡村里也是如此。中国并摄制了不少故事影片和记录影片；目前全国并有将近两千个剧团，拥有二十万团员。
    朱义多说：新中国在极短的时期内所进行的建设事业已使全世界感到惊奇不已。现在中国第一个经济建设的五年计划已经开始。这种有计划的经济是针对着全国人民利益的。新中国的全体人民已经表现了他们巨大的能力，因此五年计划一定是能够实现的，甚至是可以提前实现的。
    朱义多得出了这样的结论，即：“中国人民和中国工人阶级在毛泽东主席的英明领导下，不仅表现了他们执行国家经济建设计划的能力，而且也显示了他们是有足够的力量来保卫世界和平的。”
    朱义多在演说中，号召印尼人民和印尼工人阶级加强团结，扩大和巩固民族统一战线，反对帝国主义。
