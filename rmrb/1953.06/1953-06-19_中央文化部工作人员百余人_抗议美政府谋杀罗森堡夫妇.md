Over One Hundred Staff Members of the Central Ministry of Culture
Protest U.S. Government's Murder of the Rosenbergs
    A letter from Yin Junyan, Jiang Yufang and 152 other comrades, staff members of the Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government: The Eisenhower government has rejected the Rosenbergs' appeal for the fourth time and is preparing to execute them immediately. Each of us feels extremely indignant! We demand that the U.S. government immediately revoke the death sentence against the Rosenbergs.
    Faced with this serious event, we see even more clearly the despicable face of the reactionary ruling clique in the United States. At the same time, we also deeply feel how noble the excellent qualities of this pair of peace-loving and upright Americans—the Rosenbergs—are, that they love peace and justice more than life itself.
    We lodge a serious protest against the reactionary act of the U.S. government in plotting to murder the Rosenbergs.

    中央文化部工作人员百余人
    抗议美政府谋杀罗森堡夫妇
    中央人民政府文化部工作人员尹君彦、蒋玉芳等一百五十二位同志来信：艾森豪威尔政府已经第四次拒绝罗森堡夫妇的上诉，准备马上杀害他们的性命。我们每一个人都感到万分的愤慨！我们要求美国政府立即撤销对罗森堡夫妇死刑的判决。
    在这个严重事件的面前，我们更进一步看清了美国反动统治集团的卑怯面目。同时，我们也深深感到这一对爱好和平的正直的美国人——罗森堡夫妇，他们爱好和平、爱好正义甚于生命的优良品质，是多么高尚。
    我们对美国政府阴谋杀害罗森堡夫妇的反动行为，提出严重抗议。
