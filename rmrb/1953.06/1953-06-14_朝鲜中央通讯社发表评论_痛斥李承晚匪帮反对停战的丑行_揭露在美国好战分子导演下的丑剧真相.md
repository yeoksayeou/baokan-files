Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, June 13th: The Korean Central News Agency published a commentary on the 11th, exposing the truth of the farce of the "anti-armistice" movement staged by the Li Chengwan gang under the direction of some warmongers in the United States.

The commentary wrote: The signing of the agreement on the repatriation of prisoners of war by the negotiating parties on June 8th has made it possible for the armistice to be realized soon, and has opened the way for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. All people with good will around the world warmly welcome this major event in the current international situation. However, the traitor Li Chengwan is still frantically opposing the unanimous expectations of the world and the urgent demands of the Korean people, clamoring against the Korean armistice, attempting to continue the slaughter and destruction in order to prolong his remaining days in a sea of people's blood.

The commentary pointed out: From the beginning of the armistice negotiations, the traitors, ignoring the resolute protests of the South Korean people, have frequently forcibly mobilized hooligans on the streets and ignorant national school children in order to disguise the ridiculous slogan of "swearing to oppose the armistice" as the demand of the masses, organizing "demonstration processions" and staging the farce of shouting "northward advance." Now, the traitor Li Chengwan has become so arrogant that he has gone from clamoring "swearing to oppose the armistice" to stubbornly driving countless people to continue to die.

The commentary continued: The Li gang shamefully refused to participate in the armistice negotiations and deliberately leaked information about the administrative meetings in order to hinder the progress of the negotiations. On June 7th, when the Li gang saw that the negotiating parties might sign an agreement on the issue of prisoner of war repatriation, they declared martial law in various parts of South Korea and mobilized a group of lackeys to create another arrogant farce of "swearing to oppose the armistice" under the threat of weapons.

The commentary pointed out: The struggles of the bandits are an attempt to incite war and continue to obstruct the realization of peace in Korea. The main problem is not any disagreement between Li Chengwan and his American masters, but that Li Chengwan's "anti-armistice" movement completely reflects the opinions of some warmongers in the United States who are afraid of the Korean armistice. As the entire process of the Korean armistice negotiations over the past twenty-three months has proven, some warmongers in the United States have always stubbornly opposed the realization of the Korean armistice.

The commentary analyzed the factors that led to the agreement on the issue of prisoner of war repatriation, pointing out that this was due to: the heroic power of the Chinese and Korean People's Army on the Korean front; the consistent and sincere efforts of the Chinese and Korean governments to peacefully resolve the Korean issue; the full support of the world's democratic forces, led by the great Soviet Union; and the upsurge of the world's people's peace movement. The commentary pointed out: Washington had to reach an agreement with us in the face of this serious reality. However, despite this, some warmongers in the United States still refuse to recognize this fact. And this is precisely the encouragement for Li Chengwan, who hates peace and fears the armistice. Therefore, we must pay close attention to the Li Chengwan gang's act of openly opposing the agreement on the issue of prisoner of war repatriation, which is encouraged by some warmongers across the ocean.

The commentary said: The Li Chengwan gang opposes the agreement on transferring prisoners of war who are not directly repatriated to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, and threatens to clamor that "those prisoners who are unwilling to return to communist rule...will rise up in revolt against the Indian army." This clearly shows that they are still trying to forcibly detain prisoners of war.

The commentary emphasized: The US side should faithfully abide by and implement the provisions of the agreement and earnestly prevent any dangerous attempts and actions to forcibly detain prisoners of war. This will be another test of the US side's sincerity and practical action in implementing the agreement. All those who are willing to peacefully resolve the Korean issue must be vigilant. It is worth noting that at this very moment, Eisenhower wrote to Li Chengwan saying that the United States is prepared to conclude a so-called "mutual defense treaty" with the Li Chengwan gang after the signing of the Korean armistice agreement.

The commentary asked: Why is it necessary to conclude a so-called "mutual defense treaty"?

The commentary analyzed: On the one hand, the traitor Li Chengwan attempts to provide cannon fodder to his master, standing on the forefront of the war of aggression that some warmongers in the United States fantasize about, once again provoking fratricidal war, causing the people to continue to bleed indefinitely, in order to temporarily maintain his ugly life; on the other hand, if the United States concludes a so-called "mutual defense treaty" with Li Chengwan, its intention is undoubtedly to continue to place the Li Chengwan gang under US military rule, instigating the Li Chengwan gang to sabotage the armistice and peace in Korea, and obstruct the Korean people's own path to unifying Korea, thereby deepening the division of Korea. Doing so is obviously contrary to the desire to achieve an armistice and peacefully resolve the Korean issue, and is obviously in conflict with the goal of the upcoming high-level political conference to seek the peaceful reunification of Korea. Therefore, this is an act of trampling on the legitimate wishes and legitimate rights of the Korean people, and violating the will of peace-loving people around the world.

The commentary concluded: The world's attention is focused on Korea, because the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue will be able to ease international tensions and prepare the conditions for resolving urgent international problems. The signing of the Korean armistice agreement is already in sight. The evil acts of the traitor Li Chengwan gang and some warmongers in the United States in hindering the realization of the armistice will surely be condemned by all the Korean people and the people of the world.

### 朝鲜中央通讯社发表评论  痛斥李承晚匪帮反对停战的丑行  揭露在美国好战分子导演下的丑剧真相

    痛斥李承晚匪帮反对停战的丑行
    揭露在美国好战分子导演下的丑剧真相
    【新华社平壤十三日电】朝鲜中央通讯社在十一日发表评论，揭露李承晚匪帮在美国某些好战分子导演下所演出的“反对停战”运动的丑剧真相。
    评论写道：六月八日谈判双方签订关于遣返战俘问题的协议，使停战不久就可实现，并打开了和平解决朝鲜问题的道路。全世界一切有着善良意志的人们都热烈地欢迎这个目前国际形势中的重大事件。但是，卖国贼李承晚却仍在疯狂地反对全世界一致的期望和朝鲜人民的迫切要求，叫嚷着反对朝鲜停战，企图继续屠杀和破坏，以在人民的血海中，苟延其残喘。
    评论指出：从停战谈判开始的时候起，卖国贼们就不顾南朝鲜人民的坚决抗议，为了把可笑的“誓死反对停战”的口号伪装成群众的要求，而经常强制动员街头上的流氓和无知的国民学校儿童，组织
    “示威行列”，演出高喊“北进”的丑剧。现在，卖国贼李承晚已经狂妄得从叫嚣“誓死反对停战”到固执地驱使无数人民继续死亡的地步了。
    评论接着说：李匪帮可耻地拒绝参加停战谈判，并为阻碍谈判的进展而故意洩露行政性会议的情况。六月七日，当李匪帮看到谈判双方可能签订关于战俘遣返问题的协议时，就在南朝鲜各地宣布了戒严令，动员一群喽囉，在武器威胁下，又一次制造了“誓死反对停战”的狂妄把戏。
    评论指出：匪徒们的挣扎，是企图煽动战争，继续阻挠朝鲜和平的实现。主要的问题不在于李承晚和他的美国主子之间的任何意见分歧，而在于李承晚的“反对停战”运动完全反映了害怕朝鲜停战的美国国内某些好战分子的意见。正如二十三个月来朝鲜停战谈判的全部过程所证明的一样，美国某些好战分子始终顽固地反对朝鲜停战的实现。
    评论分析了使战俘遣返问题达成协议的因素，指出这是由于：朝中人民军队在朝鲜前线发挥了英雄的威力；朝中两国政府为和平解决朝鲜问题作了始终如一的诚挚努力；以伟大的苏联为首的世界民主力量的完全支持；全世界人民和平运动的高涨。评论指出：华盛顿在这严肃的现实面前，不得不与我方达成协议。然而，尽管这样，美国的某些好战分子仍然不肯承认这种事实。而这正是对于憎恶和平、害怕停战的李承晚的鼓舞。因此对于受着大洋彼岸某些好战分子鼓舞的李承晚匪帮公然反对关于战俘遣返问题的协议的行为，我们必须严密注意。
    评论说：李承晚匪帮反对关于将不直接遣返的战俘移交给中立国遣返委员会的协议，而威胁地叫嚣说：“那些不愿回到共产主义统治下的俘虏们……将要起来暴动，对抗印度军队”。这就明白地说明，他们仍在企图强迫扣留战俘。
    评论强调指出：美方应该忠实地遵守和执行协议的规定，认真防止任何强迫扣留战俘的危险企图和行动。这将是对于美方执行协议的诚意和实际行动的又一考验。一切愿意和平解决朝鲜问题的人，都必须提高警惕。值得注意的是，正在这个时候，艾森豪威尔写信给李承晚说，美国准备在签订朝鲜停战协定以后和李承晚匪帮缔结所谓“共同防御条约”。
    评论问道：为什么需要缔结所谓“共同防御条约”呢？
    评论分析说：一方面，卖国贼李承晚企图向他的主子提供炮灰，站在美国某些好战分子所妄想的侵略战争的前哨，再一次挑拨同族内战，使人民继续无限制地流血，以暂时维持他的丑恶生命；另一方面，美国如果和李承晚缔结所谓“共同防御条约”的话，其意图无疑是要把李承晚匪帮继续置于美国的军事统治下，嗾使李承晚匪帮破坏朝鲜的停战与和平，阻挡朝鲜人民自己统一朝鲜的道路，而使朝鲜的分裂深刻化。这样做，显然是与实现朝鲜停战与和平解决朝鲜问题愿望相违背的，显然是和行将召开的高一级政治会议谋求朝鲜的和平统一的目标相抵触的。因此，这是蹂躏朝鲜人民的正当意愿与合法权利，违反全世界爱好和平人民意向的行为。
    评论最后说：全世界的注意力正集中于朝鲜，因为朝鲜问题的和平解决将能够缓和国际紧张局势，并将为解决紧迫的国际问题准备条件。朝鲜停战协定的签订，已经摆在面前了。卖国贼李承晚匪帮和美国某些好战分子妨害实现停战的罪恶行为，必将受到全朝鲜人民和全世界人民的谴责。
