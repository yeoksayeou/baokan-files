    捷克斯洛伐克国民议会通过法案
    取消配给制实行币制改革
    【新华社一日讯】据塔斯社布拉格讯：捷克斯洛伐克共和国国民议会在五月三十日举行会议，全体一致通过了关于取消食品和制成品配给制及实行币制改革的法案。
    法案由共和国总理威·西罗基代表共和国政府和捷克斯洛伐克共产党中央委员会向会议提出。法案规定从今年六月一日起取消配给制，并定出了统一的国定零售价格，以消除商品的配给价格和非配给价格间的差额。法案并规定自六月一日起发行金本位的新克朗，兑换旧克朗。新克朗和苏联卢布的兑换比率为十八比十。
    五月三十一日，捷克斯洛伐克各报全文刊载了国民议会所通过的法案，并发表了财政部部长关于币制改革的步骤的指令，以及国内贸易部部长关于实行食品和制成品国定零售价格的命令。红色权利报发表了题为“币制改革和取消配给制是我们经济上的进一步发展”的社论，指出：币制改革和取消配给制是捷克斯洛伐克人民生活中的极其重要的事件。捷克斯洛伐克人民从此就可以获得价值稳定的克朗，而实行了将近十四年的配给制度也就要完全废除了。这是由于工人阶级和全体劳动人民的努力和苏联的经常帮助的结果。这一措施已为劳动人民的物质和文化水平的进一步提高创造了必要的条件。
