    New Changes
    By Our Correspondent An Gang
    The responsibility system movement established in Anshan Iron and Steel's basic construction units has greatly enhanced the working class's spirit of cherishing state property. Workers have taken action to combat waste and lack of accountability. New labor concepts and labor discipline are being established. The responsibility system movement is a revolutionary ideological movement that has inspired the working class's sense of ownership, giving rise to many exemplary role models.
    
    "Cherish Tools, Recycle Materials"
    
    "Cherish tools, recycle materials"—this slogan, put forward by the workers of the steel rebar and formwork team of the steelmaking construction engineering company, has now become the common slogan of workers on the construction site, and a material recycling campaign is being launched everywhere. The steel rebar and formwork team is the largest engineering team on the large construction site. In exposing waste and lack of accountability, they proposed: "We cannot simply oppose these phenomena while still standing by and watching waste and lack of accountability without doing anything about it." Everyone pitched in to clean up the site, organize the warehouse, and convert wood formwork scattered on the ground into finished products for storage. In the past, steel rebar numbering was often incorrect. This time, everyone built a mat shed warehouse for the steel rebar, established procedures for steel rebar entering and leaving the warehouse, and stipulated a system of division of labor and dedicated custodianship. The steel rebar and formwork team also recovered materials worth 300 million yuan from the construction site. When workers from the formwork installation team of the rolling mill engineering company were repairing old templates, they saw that the ground was full of usable old wire nails and proposed the slogan: "Do not waste or discard a single nail." They picked up the nails one by one from the ground, collecting fifty jin in two days. When two workers from the excavation team of the steelmaking construction engineering company were cleaning up the site, they found thirty jin of cement under the waste materials. They responsibly carried it back and handed it over to the command post and work section. At the time, no one was willing to take care of it. The worker said, "Fine, if you don't care, someone will." So, he carried the cement to the political department and requested a solution. Before "May Day," a comrade from the trade union casually took two good red pine timbers from the site to build a parade float. The workers saw it and criticized him: "Using such good red pine to build a float is a waste of talent. This material should be reserved for use on the construction site." Comrade Zhao Yi of the materials section of the metal structure engineering company was responsible for recycling materials. He did not go home to sleep for more than twenty days. Due to his efforts, he recovered 920 tons of steel.
    
    Now, there are fewer and fewer scattered materials on the construction site, and material recycling has become a movement.
    
    Careful Calculation
    
    As workers' sense of ownership and responsibility has increased, they are carefully calculating all kinds of issues. Before the calculation, it may seem "small," but once calculated, it becomes a large number. Ma Chuanji, a materials distributor in the supply section of the steelmaking construction engineering company, used to distribute materials by "giving as much as was requested" without checking. This time, when the concrete team requested 1,000 grout brushes, Ma Chuanji checked directly with the site to understand the actual needs, and as a result, only thirty brushes needed to be issued. Zhu Shigui and Feng Shiping, workers from the concrete team, were excavating the foundation for the third work section. The foreman asked them to haul the excavated soil out and then haul the soil from outside back to fill the foundation. They felt that this method was somewhat wasteful, so they carefully studied the quality of the excavated soil and found that it was the same as the soil hauled in from outside. They proposed using the excavated soil instead of the hauled-in soil, saving more than 10 million yuan. Zhao Lihua of the mixing team used to think that "you're going to drop grains of rice when you eat, so it doesn't matter if there's a little waste in the project." He poured cement using the "digging the belly" method, which involved using a shovel to cut open the cement bag from the middle, lift the two corners, and pour. He thought this method was effortless, fast, and clean. Now, after calculating, he realized that each cement bag cost 4,500 yuan, and tearing open 1,000 bags would result in a loss of 4.5 million yuan. The next day, he stopped "digging the belly," saving forty-eight cement bags, which he brought back and handed over to the chairman of the trade union. A worker from the steel rebar and formwork team used to waste the most nails, and everyone called him the "Waste Nail King." When he worked, he would always shout "Bring the nails!" and drop them as he used them. This time, he recognized his mistake, went to the department store after work to buy a zipper, and had his wife sew it onto his clothes pocket. When he arrived at the site, he announced to everyone: "From now on, I will put the nails in a pocket with a zipper, so you won't find a single nail." Workers in the fourth work section of the rolling mill construction engineering company had half a cubic meter of concrete left over after completing the foundation in seven days, and there was no way to deal with it. At this time, four comrades from the surveying team saw it after getting off work, so they thought of the fact that the surveying team had seven pile markers that needed to be grouted the next day. In order not to waste this half a cubic meter of concrete, everyone took the initiative to grout the pile markers ahead of time, so that all the concrete was used. The second team assigned a task to three workers, including Gao Youwen. After arriving at the site and calculating, they realized that it would not take three workers, and two people could complete it in one day. They took the initiative to propose to a leading comrade to reduce one person, and they completed the task ahead of schedule.
    
    Careful calculation requires having a clear idea. Comrades in the management departments have begun to pay attention to studying and understanding the work conditions and actual needs on the site, changing the past practice of not going deep into the site and sitting in the office to "issue" materials and "copy" forms. The materials section of the metal structure company has achieved flexible allocation of steel, overcoming the past phenomenon of stockpiling steel on one side while waiting for materials to stop work on the other side. Once, the construction site needed a certain type of channel steel, but there was no stock in the warehouse, and there was not enough time to purchase it. They took the initiative to go to various factories to find it and found that the metal structure factory had twenty-nine pieces in stock, which were immediately allocated to the construction site. Someone on the construction site wanted to claim 300 light bulbs at once. The comrade in charge of materials said, "If it's not urgent, please wait an hour and come back." So, he personally ran to the construction site to check and found that only thirty light bulbs were missing. He then issued thirty light bulbs.
    
    Making full use of waste is also a project that requires careful calculation. Sun Rentao, a worker from the metal structure engineering team, used to throw away the cut iron plates when he was working. This time, he picked up all the discarded iron plates and made screw boxes. The oxygen team lacked gas cylinders and was about to stop work and wait for materials. Everyone thought of a way to use waste to make four gas cylinders, and work did not stop.
    
    Guaranteeing Project Quality
    
    Guaranteeing the highest quality standards of the project and preventing it from being damaged in any way is the most important manifestation of people's improved awareness. In the past, the first team of the steelmaking construction engineering company did not have a division of labor during secondary grouting (i.e., the final pouring of concrete after the machine is installed). If they waited until the wind was blown and the crushed stone was inspected before pouring, not only would the work efficiency be low, but the quality would also be affected. This time, everyone used their brains to study and improve the method, implemented assembly line operations, and divided responsibilities. They also improved the wind pipe and increased the wind power. When the workers were grouting, they found that the machine reinforcement edge was padded with red bricks, which did not comply with the construction operation regulations. They suggested that the foreman replace them with iron pads to ensure the safety of the project. This time, grouting improved work efficiency by 100% and greatly improved project quality.
    
    Carrying Forward the Spirit of Selfless Labor
    
    One day, the Jin Yongcheng group of the concrete team returned to the dormitory after completing the foundation, and it rained. Jin Yongcheng immediately thought that the newly laid foundation would be damaged by the rain. He immediately mobilized five workers and ran back to the site with him in the rain to cover the foundation. After returning, he also helped other workers dry their clothes before going to rest. Workers Ma Chaozhong and Qu Zhaolin were walking halfway home from work when it rained. The two of them ran back to the site from halfway in the rain to find ways to protect the foundation.
    
    The above specific facts tell us:
    
    The basic construction workers of Anshan Iron and Steel have carried forward a highly responsible spirit in the responsibility system movement. The workers' thinking has undergone significant changes in the struggle against waste and lack of accountability. Everyone used criticism and self-criticism to examine the various bad habits left over from the old society and established a sense of ownership. A worker said: "In the past, I felt sad when my own things were lost, but I didn't feel bad when I saw state-owned things being placed and discarded at will. Now, I would rather lose my own things than damage state property." This conscious thought of the working class of cherishing state property is rapidly and widely developing. The task of the Party's ideological work is to vigorously promote advanced thinking and raise it to the level of communist principles to improve the awareness of the working class. Anshan Iron and Steel's basic construction political work pays great attention to commending various model actions and conducting advanced ideological education with living people and events, which has achieved success. The more widespread and in-depth this education is, the more effective the work of establishing the responsibility system will be.
    
    Another important manifestation of the basic construction workers of Anshan Iron and Steel in the responsibility system movement is: correcting mistakes while criticizing them, and being consistent in word and deed. For shortcomings that are exposed that can be corrected immediately, they must use their brains to come up with ways to correct them. The workers said: "We cannot criticize while committing mistakes," "We must manage our homes well and help the leadership solve problems," "We must have practical actions and not just correct errors with our mouths." Under the guidance of advanced thinking, the workers solved problems that had not been solved in the past two years. For example, the fact that the construction site used to be full of materials could not be solved by administrative orders alone. After everyone's awareness was raised, the construction site was cleaned up completely. A nail may seem small, but one team recovered fifty jin in two days. This becomes a big deal. Without the workers' conscious and concrete actions to cherish state property, it would not be possible to eliminate waste in every corner. The workers' practical actions have prepared for the establishment of a good, fast, economical, and safe responsibility system. The slogan "Boldly expose, actively suggest, and jointly solve" put forward by the Anshan Municipal Party Committee and the Iron and Steel Company in the responsibility system movement has encouraged the enthusiasm of the broad masses of workers, inspired them to actively solve various phenomena related to waste and lack of accountability, and formed a heated upsurge of criticizing and improving at the same time, which has a great practical impetus to the establishment and implementation of the responsibility system.

    新的变化
    本报记者  安岗
    鞍钢基本建设单位建立责任制运动大大提高了工人阶级爱护国家财产的精神。职工们已经行动起来为肃清浪费和无人负责现象而斗争。新的劳动观点和劳动纪律正在树立起来。建立责任制运动是一个革命性的思想运动，它激发了工人阶级的主人翁思想，涌现出许多值得人们效法的榜样。
    “爱护工具、回收材料”
    “爱护工具、回收材料”，这个口号是炼钢建筑工程公司钢筋木模队职工提出的，现在已成为工地现场工人的共同口号，到处都展开了回收材料的运动。钢筋木模队是大型工地最大的一个工程队。他们在揭发浪费和无人负责现象中，提出：“不能一边反，一边还看着浪费、无人负责的现象不管。”大家动手清理现场，整理仓库，把散放在地上的木模截长去短改成成品加工入库。过去钢筋编号常有错误，这次大家为钢筋搭起了一座席子仓库，建立了钢筋出库入库的手续，规定了分工专责保管制度。钢筋木模队还从工地拣回了价值三亿元的材料。轧钢工程公司加工厂木模安装队工人修理旧模板时，看到满地都是能使用的旧洋钉，提出：“不能浪费和丢掉一个钉子”的口号，把地下钉子一个个拣起，两天内拣了五十斤。炼钢建筑工程公司挖土队两位工人在清理现场时，从废料底下发现了三十斤洋灰，他们负责地抬回来，交到指挥台、工段。当时没有人愿意管。这位工人说：“好，你们不管有人管。”于是把洋灰抬到了政治处，请求设法解决。“五一”节前，工会一位同志到现场随便拿了两根好红松木准备搭游行彩车，工人们看见了，就提出批评：“你们用这样好的红松木搭彩车，岂不大材小用，这种材料应当留给工地使用。”金属结构工程公司材料科赵义同志负责回收材料，他前后有二十多天没回家睡觉，由于他的努力，回收了钢材九百二十吨。
    现在，工地上散乱的材料越来越少了，回收材料成了运动。
    精打细算
    职工们主人翁思想和责任观念提高了，他们对待各种问题都要算一算细账。这笔账未算前，看起来似乎“不大”，可是一算就成了一笔大数。炼钢建筑工程公司供应科发料员马传骥过去发料是“要多少，给多少”，从不审查。这次混凝土队提出计划要一千把浆刷子，马传骥审查时，直接同现场联系，了解了实际需要，结果只要发三十把刷子就够了。混凝土队工人朱世贵、冯世平在给三工段挖基础时，领工员让他们把挖出来的土拉出去，再把外边的土拉回来填基础。他们觉得这个办法有些浪费，于是，仔细研究挖出来的土质，发现同外面拉进来的土是一样的。他们提议用挖出来的土代替拉进来的土，节省了一千余万元。混合队赵立华，过去认为“吃饭还要掉饭粒，工程浪费一点没有什么”，他倒洋灰是用“掏肚子”办法，就是用铁锹把洋灰袋从当中划开，提两角一倒。他认为这个办法又省劲又快又干净，现在一算账，才知道每个洋灰袋是四千五百元，划破一千个就损失四百五十万元。第二天他就不“掏肚子”了，省了四十八个洋灰袋，带回来交给了工会主席。钢筋木模队一位工人，过去浪费钉子最多，大家叫他“浪费钉子大王”，他工作时就一直喊“拿钉子来”，随用随掉。这次他认识了错误，下工后到百货公司买了个拉链，让他的妻子给缝在衣服口袋上，到现场时向大家宣布：“今后把钉子放在有拉链的口袋里，让你们一个钉子也找不着”。轧钢建筑工程公司第四工段工人七日打完基础后剩下半立方公尺混凝土无法处理，这时测量队有四位同志下班看到，于是想起测量队还有七个桩标要在第二天打灰，为了不损失这半立方公尺混凝土，大家动手提前打好桩标，使混凝土都用上了。二中队分配一件任务给高有文等三个工人，他们到现场一看，计算一下，认为用不了三个工，两个人可以一天干完，他们便主动向一领导同志提出减少一人，还提前完成了任务。
    精打细算必须心中有数。管理部门同志开始注意研究和了解现场工作情况和实际需要，改变过去不深入现场，坐在办公室“照发”材料、“照抄”表格的作风。金属结构公司材料科做到了灵活调拨钢材，克服了过去一边积压钢材一边停工待料的现象。有一次，工地需要某号槽钢，库内没有存货，采购来不及，他们就主动地到各厂去找，发现金属结构一厂积存了二十九根，马上就调拨给工地。工地有人一次要领三百个灯泡，管材料的同志说：“如不急用，请等一个钟头再来”，于是，他就亲自跑到工地上去查看，原来只缺三十个灯泡。他就批发了三十个灯泡。
    充分利用废物也是要精打细算的一个项目。金属结构工程队工人孙仁涛过去作工，把剪下来的铁板都扔掉了，这次他把扔掉的都拣回来，作成螺丝盒子。氧气班缺乏瓦斯罐，眼看就要停工待料，大家想办法利用废物作了四个瓦斯罐，没有停工。
    保证工程质量
    保证工程的最高质量标准，不使它受到一点损害。这是人们觉悟提高的最重要的表现。炼钢建筑工程公司第一小队过去在二次灌浆（即机器安装后最后一次的浇灌混凝土）时没有分工，如果等到吹完风检完石碴再浇灌，不但工作效率低，而且还影响质量。这次大家动脑筋研究改进办法，实行流水作业，分工负责，还改进了风管，加大了风力。工人们在灌浆时发现在机械加固边下面是用红砖垫的，不合施工操作规程，他们建议领工员换用了铁垫，保证了工程的安全。这一次灌浆，提高了工作效率一倍，大大改善了工程质量。
    发扬了忘我的劳动精神
    混凝土队金永成小组一天打完基础回到宿舍，天下雨，金永成马上就想到新打的基础会被雨浇坏的。他立刻动员了五个工人和他一同冒雨跑回现场，盖住基础，回去后还帮助别的工人烤干了衣服后才去休息。工人马朝中、曲兆林下班走在半路，天下雨了，两人就由半路冒雨跑回现场，设法保护了基础。
    上面这些具体事实告诉了我们：
    鞍钢基本建设工人在建立责任制运动中发扬了高度负责的精神。职工们的思想在反浪费、反无人负责现象斗争中起了显著的变化。大家用批评与自我批评的方法检查了旧社会遗留给人们的各种恶习，树立了主人翁的思想。一位工人说：“过去是自己的东西丢掉心中难过，看到国家东西乱放乱扔不心疼。现在是宁可丢了自己的也不能损害了国家的财产。”这种工人阶级的自觉的爱护国家财产的思想正在迅速地普遍地发展。党的思想工作任务就是要大力发扬先进思想，并把它提高到共产主义的原则去提高工人阶级的觉悟。鞍钢基本建设政治工作中十分注意表扬各种模范行动，用活人活事进行先进的思想教育，获得了成功。这种教育越普遍越深入，建立责任制的工作就越有成效。
    鞍钢基本建设工人在建立责任制运动中另一个重要表现是：边反边改，言行一致。凡是揭发出来的可以马上设法改正的缺点，他们都要动脑筋想出办法来改正它。工人们说：“我们不能一边反，一边犯”，“我们要管好家，帮助领导方面解决问题”，“我们要有实际行动，不能光用嘴巴来纠正错误。”在先进的思想引导下，职工们解决了两年来所不能解决的问题。譬如工地上过去满地是材料，这件事光靠行政下命令是解决不了问题的，大家觉悟提高后，工地就被收拾得一干二净。一个钉子，看起来很小，可是一个小队两天就回收了五十斤。这就成了大事。没有工人的自觉的爱护国家财产的具体行动，就不可能把每个角落内的浪费现象消灭掉。工人们的实际行动为建立好、快、省、安全等责任制作了准备。领导方面可以从群众中集中这些行动的经验，并使之成为经常的责任制度。鞍山市委和钢铁公司在建立责任制运动中提出的“大胆揭发，积极建议，共同解决”的口号，鼓舞了广大职工的积极性，启发他们主动地解决各种有关浪费和无人负责的现象，形成了热烈的一边揭发一边改进的热潮，这对于建立和贯彻执行责任制有着极大的实际推动作用。
