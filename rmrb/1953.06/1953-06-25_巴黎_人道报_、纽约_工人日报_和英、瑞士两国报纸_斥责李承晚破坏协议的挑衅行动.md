Xinhua News Agency, Prague, June 24th: An editorial in the Paris "L'Humanité" on June 22nd stated that recent events in South Korea once again prove that despite the repatriation of prisoners of war agreement and the possibility of an armistice in Korea giving people around the world great hope for peace, the creators of war still have no intention of complying with the will of the people and are attempting to continue their frustrated plans by using all kinds of provocative actions, all kinds of violations of their promises, and all kinds of crimes they may commit. Syngman Rhee has transferred most of the prisoners of war from the POW camps to his military camps, "while the U.S. military headquarters pretends not to be related to this matter." The editorial emphasized that this is a destructive act for which the United States cannot shirk responsibility.

"L'Humanité" talked about Syngman Rhee's recent provocative actions, as well as the United States' promise to give him aid and sign a "mutual defense treaty," which encourages his actions, and the fact that the United States has not taken action to retrieve the "released" prisoners of war.

The editorial also said: "The most important thing is: Syngman Rhee's actions towards prisoners of war are aimed at hindering the re-establishment of peace. This action was launched precisely when it seemed that there was nothing else to delay the signing of the armistice agreement."

The editorial concluded: "But this crime, which has been exposed before the people of the world, does not demonstrate their strength, but reveals their weakness and anxiety."

Xinhua News Agency, Prague, June 24th: The New York "Daily Worker" published an editorial on the 19th, condemning the U.S. side's connivance with Syngman Rhee's forced detention of prisoners of war, and calling on the American people to take action to stop this provocative action.

The editorial said: Clark knew about Syngman Rhee's actions in advance and reported them verbatim to Washington. This action makes even those who believe in Truman and Eisenhower's so-called "humanitarian principles" understand that the so-called "no forced repatriation" is nonsense from beginning to end, and its purpose is to cover up the true intention of forced detention.

The editorial said: "In all other cases, the U.S. command has shown itself fully capable of preventing prisoners of war from 'escaping'. It has demonstrated this capability by arbitrarily using rifle butts, bayonets, grenades, poison gas, tanks and flamethrowers. It has demonstrated this capability with the lives of three thousand Korean and Chinese prisoners of war. But how is it that at this very moment, it has become 'incapable' of dealing with this situation?"

The editorial then asked: "How can Eisenhower and his government now say that they have nothing to do with this unprecedented act of betrayal and try to push all the blame onto Syngman Rhee?"

The editorial called on the American people to take immediate action to save peace in Korea, demanding that Washington order the U.S. military authorities in Korea to stop this collective detention of North Korean prisoners of war, and to condemn Syngman Rhee's provocation to world peace with actions, and demanding that Congress conduct an investigation to find out who in the U.S. government and military authorities should be responsible for this war crime.

Xinhua News Agency, June 24th: British and Swedish public opinion strongly condemned Syngman Rhee's provocative actions aimed at undermining the armistice.

The British "Observer" said: Syngman Rhee "hopes to undermine the armistice by the success of the conspiracy to release those prisoners of war who are to be transferred to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission according to the terms of the armistice agreement." The newspaper said, "Even if his hope is shattered, his actions have given us a warning that in the future he may still break his word and undermine the armistice at any time." Therefore, "it is necessary to prevent any further perfidious actions on the part of Syngman Rhee."

The "New Statesman" magazine said: Syngman Rhee's order to "release" Korean prisoners of war "is an irresponsible struggle to undermine the armistice negotiations -- a practice that is standard for Syngman Rhee."

Sweden's "Expressen" said that the United Nations must "expel Syngman Rhee and his regime" if it is to resolve the Korean crisis.

"Aftonbladet" said: "Syngman Rhee is not the same as the Korean people, and when he lived in the United States, he was completely unfamiliar to the Korean people."

    巴黎“人道报”、纽约“工人日报”和英、瑞士两国报纸
    斥责李承晚破坏协议的挑衅行动
    【新华社布拉格二十四日电】巴黎“人道报”六月二十二日的社论说，最近南朝鲜的事件再次证明：尽管遣返战俘的协议以及朝鲜的可能停战使全世界人民心里产生了对和平的巨大希望，战争制造者仍然无意顺从人民的意志，而企图利用各种挑衅行为、各种破坏他们诺言的行为和他们可能干的各种罪行，来继续他们的已受挫折的计划。李承晚已经把大部分战俘从战俘营移到他的军营中去，“而美军司令部却装作与这件事情没有关系的样子”。社论强调指出：但是这是美国不能推卸责任的破坏行为。
    “人道报”谈到了李承晚最近的挑衅行为，以及美国答应给他援助并与他签订“共同防御条约”这种鼓励他的作法，和美国到现在为止并没有采取行动追回“被释放”的战俘的事实。
    社论又说：“最重要的是：李承晚对待战俘的行动，目的在于阻挠重新建立和平。这一行动正是在似乎再也没有任何事情可以拖延停战协定签字的时候发动的。”
    社论结语说：“但是这种已经在全世界人民眼前暴露出来的罪行，决不是说明他们有力量，这表现了他们的孱弱与焦虑。”
    【新华社布拉格二十四日电】纽约“工人日报”十九日发表社论，谴责美方纵容李承晚强迫扣留战俘，号召美国人民行动起来制止这个挑衅行动。
    社论说：李承晚的行动，克拉克将军事先就已经知道，并曾原原本本报告给华盛顿方面。这种行动甚至使那些相信杜鲁门和艾森豪威尔所谓“人道原则”的人们都明白，所谓“不强迫遣返”从头到尾就是无稽之谈，其目的在于掩饰强迫扣留的真正企图。
    社论说：“在其他所有的情况下，美国司令部是表现完全有能力来防止战俘‘逃跑’的。它用任意使用枪托、刺刀、手榴弹、毒气、坦克和喷火器来证明它的这种能力。它用三千名朝中战俘的性命来证明它的这种能力。但是，怎么正好就在这个时候，它又变得‘无能’对付这种情况呢？”
    社论接着问道：“艾森豪威尔和他的政府现在怎么又能说自己跟这种前所未有的背信行动无关，而且设法把全部罪责都推到李承晚身上呢？”
    社论号召美国人民立即行动起来拯救朝鲜和平，要求华盛顿方面命令朝鲜美军当局制止这个集体扣留北朝鲜战俘的行动，并以行动谴责李承晚对世界和平的挑衅，要求国会进行调查，查明在美国政府和军事当局中究竟是谁应对这个战争罪行负责。
    【新华社二十四日讯】英国和瑞典舆论猛烈斥责李承晚企图破坏停战的挑衅行动。
    英国“观察家报”说：李承晚“希望借着释放那些按照停战协定条款要移交给中立国委员会的战俘的阴谋的成功来破坏停战”。该报说，“即使他的这种希望将遭破灭，他的行动已给予我们警告，今后他仍然可能随时背信弃义地破坏停战。”因此，“需要防止李承晚方面再可能有任何背信弃义的行动”。
    “新政治家”杂志说：李承晚“释放”朝鲜战俘的命令“是破坏停战谈判的不负责任的挣扎——这种做法是李承晚的标准行动”。
    瑞典的“快报”说：联合国必须“驱逐李承晚和他的政权”，如果它要解决朝鲜危机的话。
    “晚报”说：“李承晚并不等于朝鲜人民，当他侨居美国的时候，他对于朝鲜人民是完全陌生的。”
