    Tractor Group in the Forest
    By our reporter Chen Yongjin
    In early April, when I arrived again in the Yichun Forestry Area of the Lesser Khingan Mountains, the tractor group had already overfulfilled its task and returned victoriously from the forest. The tractor drivers were busily overhauling their machines, preparing for new tasks. While working in the forest, they not only pulled the wood from the mountains to the riverbank, but also pulled the timber flowing down the river to the shore. This year, tractors completed more than one-third of the timber collection and transportation tasks.
    The process by which these tractor drivers mastered the tractors was tortuous and arduous. The old tractor drivers still clearly remember the scene when they first drove the tractors to Yichun. In June 1950, dozens of tractors arrived by train from Harbin. These tractor drivers were mostly students from the Northeast Forest Industry Bureau's tractor training class. The heavy roar of the tractors brought infinite excitement to the workers in the Yichun Forestry Area who were working hard. Everyone wanted to come and see and touch these excellent machines shipped from the Soviet Union. Some people climbed onto the tractors to experience the feeling of being pulled by a tractor. The tractor drivers felt infinite excitement in this situation, but this excitement did not last long.
    In August, the tractors began their first transportation work. This was the rainy season in the Yichun Forestry Area. On those muddy roads, the tractors couldn't even move with two cubic meters of wood. People's interest in tractors decreased, and all kinds of distrustful words reached the tractor drivers' ears. Some said: This thing is as clumsy as an ox. It can't even move itself, let alone pull big trees! Some said: It's simply a waste of state wealth, insisting on bringing something for cultivating land into the forest. How can this work? Some cadres even lamented: How much are these things worth? If they were bought as horses, how many could you get? Wouldn't that be the same as completing the task? Some comrades explained: These are advanced tools from the Soviet Union. If they weren't useful, the Soviet Union wouldn't manufacture them. But the reply they received was: The Soviet Union is the Soviet Union. Everything depends on the specific situation. Haven't you seen that it works in the Soviet Union, but it doesn't work here? The branch bureau director also lost confidence in the tractors. The tractor drivers experimented arduously for more than twenty days, and the result was failure.
    Winter came. The tractor drivers were eager to complete their tasks in the winter. However, because everyone's skills were not yet proficient, it took half a day or even a whole day to transport one load of wood, and the results were still not good.
    However, they were not intimidated by the difficulties. They went out under the stars and returned wearing the stars. Some people didn't rest or eat for a whole day and night in order to repair the machines. Some people fell asleep with steamed buns in their hands. Some people were knocked down by the smoke from the tractors. When they woke up, they drove the vehicles to pull wood again. Even so, they only made two or three trips a day. They watched as the timber lay on the mountain site without any way to move it.
    At this time, the leadership convened a party and Youth League member meeting to mobilize the masses to find tricks. In order to exchange experiences, the "Forest Tractor Gazette" was published. In the process of finding tricks, Chang Bingheng, a 19-year-old tractor driver, and his assistant Zhang Xianwen first created a new record for tractor pulling wood. At the same time, they also did a good job of maintaining the machinery, ensuring that the tractors did not have accidents. Other tractor drivers also found many tricks, and everyone's experience in mastering the machinery became richer. In a short period of time, more than forty new assistants in the entire tractor team learned how to master the machines. They overfulfilled the transportation task of 8,000 cubic meters of wood that winter, and forty-three labor models emerged. They came down the mountain with glory, and people said: In the end, tractors are the way to go. If it were horse-drawn, there would be no way to complete such a large task.
    In the second winter, the comrades of the tractor team accepted even greater tasks, and they still overfulfilled their tasks. Their skills were more proficient than before, but new difficulties also arose. The timber was felled in the autumn, and many tree trunks were trapped in the mud. Once winter came, they were frozen in the ground. At first, they moved very slowly, but later they realized that the locomotive was too far away from the wood, and it would take a long time to pull the winch. As long as the locomotive was close to the wood, it would save time. After this improvement, Zhang Xianwen's locomotive pulled nine times a day. This locomotive completed 100 days' worth of tasks in 60 days, and there were no accidents all winter. Zhang Xianwen is now a formal driver. Zhang Xianwen's locomotive won three red flags last winter. The first flag was the "Safety" flag. They have never had an accident. They always seriously discuss how to avoid accidents every day and pay attention to the surrounding situation at any time. This rotating red flag has never left their locomotive. The second red flag is the "Forest Iron Ox." This flag shows that their vehicle had the highest attendance rate and completed tasks the fastest. The third is the "Superior" rotating red flag. This flag was taken away by another locomotive once, but they later won it back. The tractor drivers' skills have been generally improved. In 1950, it often happened that locomotives were left on the mountain because they could not pull the wood, and sometimes tractors had to be used to pull tractors. Now these things are gone. Now each timber collection vehicle does not pull two cubic meters, but an average of seven or eight cubic meters. In 1950, the "Stalin 80" timber truck could only pull a hundred or so cubic meters, but last winter it reached two hundred and sixty-six cubic meters.

### 森林中的拖拉机群

    森林中的拖拉机群
    本报记者  陈勇进
    四月初，当我再次到达小兴安岭伊春林区的时候，拖拉机群已经超额地完成了任务，从森林里胜利地回来了。拖拉机手们正在紧张地检修机器，准备迎接新的任务。他们在森林里工作的时候，不仅把木头从山上拉到河边，还要把河里流送的木材拉到岸上来。今年的集材、运材任务，由拖拉机完成的达到三分之一以上。
    这些拖拉机手掌握拖拉机，是经过了一段曲折艰苦的过程的。老拖拉机手们至今还清楚地记得第一次把拖拉机开到伊春时的情景。一九五○年六月，由哈尔滨开来的火车载来了几十台拖拉机。这些拖拉机手多是从东北森林工业总局拖拉机训练班出来的学生。拖拉机的沉重的马达声给伊春林区艰苦工作着的职工们带来了无限的兴奋。谁也愿意跑来看看和用手摸摸从苏联运来的这些优良的机械。有些人爬到拖拉机上尝尝被拖拉机拉着走的滋味。拖拉机手们在这种情况下感到无限的兴奋，可是这种振奋并没有持续多久。
    八月里，拖拉机初次进行运搬工作。这正是伊春林区的雨季。在那泥泞的道路上，拖拉机拉两立方公尺木材还走不动。人们对拖拉机的兴趣减低了，各种各样不信任的话送到拖拉机手的耳朵中来。有的说：这家伙笨得像牛一样，它自己就走不动，还拉什么大树呀！有的说：简直是浪费国家财富，硬把耕地的东西拿到森林里来，这怎么行呢？有些干部甚至惋惜地说：这些东西能值多少钱呀！如果买成马，看能是多少匹；那还不是一样完成任务。有的同志解释说：这是苏联的先进工具，如果不管用，苏联也不制造。但他们得到的回答是：苏联是苏联，啥东西也要看具体情况。你没看见在苏联行，在咱这里就不行吗？分局的局长也对拖拉机丧失了信心。拖拉机手们艰苦地试验了二十多天，结果是失败了。
    冬天来了。拖拉机手们都渴望着在冬天完成任务。但是由于大家的技术还不熟练，运一车木头要化一晌甚至一天的功夫，成绩还是不好。
    但是，他们并没有被困难吓倒。他们都是顶星星出去，戴星星回来。有的人为了修理机器，一天一夜不休息也不吃饭。有的人手里拿着馒头睡着了。有的人被拖拉机冒出来的烟熏倒了，清醒过来，又开着车子拉木头。即使是这样，一天才拉两三趟。眼看着木材躺在山场上没有办法。
    这时领导上召开了党、团员大会，发动群众找窍门。为了交流经验，出版了“森林拖拉机小报”。在摸窍门中间，十九岁的拖拉机手常秉衡和他的助手张宪文首先创造了拖拉机拉木材的新纪录，同时还作好了机械的保养工作，保证了拖拉机不发生事故。别的拖拉机手也摸到了不少窍门，大家掌握机械的经验丰富起来了。在短短的时间内全拖拉机队里就有四十多个新助手学会了掌握机器。他们在这年的冬天超额完成八千立方公尺木材的运输任务，出现了四十三个劳动模范。他们带着光荣下山了，人们都说：到底还是拖拉机行，要是马套子，无论如何也完不成这样大的任务。
    第二年的冬天，拖拉机队的同志接受了更大的任务，他们仍然超额地完成了任务。他们的技术较前熟练了，但新的困难也来了。木材是秋天采伐的，很多树身都陷在泥里，一到冬天就冻在地里了。开始他们搬得很慢，后来他们发觉机车离木头太远，拉绞盘就要占去很长时间；只要把机车靠近木材，就能节省时间。这样改进以后，张宪文的机车一天拉了九次。他这台机车六十天完成了一百天的任务，一冬天也没出事故。张宪文现在已经是正式司机了。张宪文的机车去年冬天得了三面红旗。第一面是“保安”旗，他们从来没有出过事故，他们每天总要认真地讨论如何避免事故，到现场随时注意周围的情况。这面循环红旗始终没有离开他们的机车。第二面红旗是“森林铁牛”，这面旗说明他们的车出勤率最多，完成任务最快。第三面是“优胜”循环红旗。这面旗曾被别的机车夺过去一次，后来又被他们夺回来了。拖拉机手们的技术是普遍地提高了。一九五○年常发生因为拉不动木头而把机车丢在山上的事情，有时还要用拖拉机来拉拖拉机，现在这些事情已经没有了。现在每个集材车不是拉二立方公尺，而是平均拉七、八立方公尺了。一九五○年“斯大林八十号”运材车只能拉百十立方公尺，去年冬天已达到二百六十六立方公尺。
