Xinhua News Agency, Copenhagen, 10th. According to TASS: The World Women's Congress continued its discussion of Mrs. Gordon's report at the morning session on the 8th. The first speaker, Venezuelan delegate Reyes Regal, reported on the situation of Venezuelan women being deprived of their rights and subjected to feudal oppression.

British delegate, Lady Baldwin, reported on the British women's movement to stop the Korean War, fight for peace, and oppose the arms race. She also said that the people of southern England were very grateful for the recent assistance from the people of the Soviet Union and China to the flood victims in their area. Amidst stormy applause, Lady Baldwin walked to the presidium and kissed Li Dequan, head of the Chinese delegation, and Ni. Popova, head of the Soviet delegation.

Ni. Popova, head of the Soviet delegation, delivered a speech which was warmly welcomed by the Congress. She said: The people of all countries are increasingly resolutely rising up against the threat of war and demanding a peaceful settlement of international disputes. Soviet women, like all Soviet people, believe that there is no dispute or outstanding issue that cannot be resolved through negotiations between the countries concerned, through peaceful means. The Soviet government has once again recently demonstrated its peaceful desire to ease international tensions and expressed its willingness to cooperate with other governments to achieve the lofty goal of strengthening world peace and international security. The Soviet people have always believed in the past and now that every nation has the right to determine its own destiny. No one can deprive them of this right, forcing them to accept the way of life, the system and the culture of others.

The Soviet delegation supports the call for women around the world to strengthen the struggle to improve the living conditions of female workers, to resolve international disputes through consultation, to stop the arms race, and to strive for close cooperation and friendship between countries in economic and cultural fields.

Referring to the suggestion that the Congress draft a "Declaration of Women's Rights," Ni. Popova said: The most important thing is to fight for the realization of the declaration, to unite women all over the world in this struggle.

Popova also said: The struggle for democratic rights and freedoms bravely waged by women in many countries is inseparable from the struggle for peace and the happy future of the next generation. The Soviet delegation agrees to establish close ties and unified actions with all national and international women's organizations in order to jointly struggle for peace, for women's rights and for the protection of children.

Pratts-Mills paid tribute to the Congress on behalf of the World Peace Council. When he announced that an agreement on the repatriation of prisoners of war had been signed in Panmunjom on June 8, the hall erupted in stormy applause.

Also speaking at the morning session were representatives from Burma, Switzerland, Chile, Transjordan, Lebanon, Bolivia, and Northern Ireland.

In the afternoon of the 8th, the Congress began group discussions, with all delegates divided into five groups to continue discussing the reports of André Andreen and Mrs. Gordon. The five groups are the Economic and Social Rights Group, the Political and Civil Rights Group, the General and Specialized Education Group, the Struggle for Peace and Friendship between Countries Group, and the Child Protection Group. After extensive discussions, each group will submit recommendations to the Congress on the issues discussed by its group.

The Congress also formed three committees, with representatives from the delegations of all countries participating in the Congress. The first committee is drafting the "Declaration of Women's Rights," the second committee is drafting a letter to women all over the world, and the third committee is drafting a resolution on the activities of the Women's International Democratic Federation.
