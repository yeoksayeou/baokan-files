Xinhua News Agency, Paris, June 11th: Following Radical Socialist Mendès France's failure, Pierre Pflimlin, leader of the French Catholic "Popular Republican Movement," also failed to form a government, continuing the French government crisis, which has persisted for twenty-two days, amid various difficulties.

This former Foreign Minister of the previous government, and also a former French Prime Minister who had twice formed and then seen his government fall, when invited by the French President to form a government, delivered a policy speech in the National Assembly on the 10th, requesting the parliament's approval for him to form a government.

Like those who requested authorization before him, Pflimlin could not but acknowledge the dire financial and economic situation of France. He said: "At the end of each month, the state is in deficit by 50 to 60 billion francs. Our deficit in the European Payments Union has reached a staggering 750 million dollars to date. We have to pay 30 to 50 million dollars to foreign countries every month. If the national treasury does not have additional income, we will indeed be unable to get through the end of June."

However, Pflimlin also stated that his government would not change the policies that had led France to this disastrous situation. He said that he would not consider withdrawing the French colonial army in Indochina, and would expedite the establishment of a war system in Indochina as soon as possible. He emphasized the need to safeguard the interests of French colonists in Tunisia and Morocco. He said he was in favor of convening a Four-Power conference, but also said that a US-British-French conference would help formulate a common program for such a Four-Power conference. He also expressed support for the United States' European "unity" plan. He said his government "will continue to work to establish European political institutions" and intends to ask parliament to approve the European Army Agreement. He also requested expanded government powers. Thus, Pflimlin did not offer any practical solutions to the current French political and economic crisis, but merely repeated old tunes.

After parliamentary debate, an authorization vote was held. The results of the vote were 313 in favor and 228 against. Pflimlin did not obtain the majority required by the constitution.

    法国政府危机延续
    【新华社十一日讯】巴黎消息：继激进社会党的孟戴斯—弗朗斯之后，法国天主教“人民共和党”领袖皮杜尔组阁又告失败，延续了二十二天的法国政府危机继续在种种困难下未能解决。
    这个前任政府的外交部长，也是已经两度组过阁而又倒台的前法国政府总理应法国总统邀请出面组阁时，曾于十日在国民议会发表政策演说，要求议会批准他出来组织政府。
    像在他以前的几个请求授权的人一样，皮杜尔也不能不承认法国财政经济情况的窘迫。他说：“每个月月底国家都亏空五、六百亿法郎。我们在欧洲支付同盟的赤字到今天已经达到七亿五千万美元的庞大数字。我们每个月都要付给外国三千万到五千万美元。如果国库没有额外收入，我们的确无法度过六月底。”
    但是，皮杜尔又表示他的政府将并不改变那个使法国走到这种灾难境地的政策。他说，他将不考虑撤退在印度支那的法国殖民军，而且还要尽快在印度支那建立战争体制。他强调要在突尼斯和摩洛哥保障法国殖民者的利益。他说，他赞成召开四大国会议；但又说美英法三国会议将有助于为这种四国会议拟定一个共同纲领。他还表示拥护美国的欧洲“统一”计划。他说，他的政府“要继续努力建立欧洲政治机构”，并且打算要求议会批准欧洲军协定。他也要求扩大政府权力。这样，皮杜尔并未提出任何解决目前法国政治经济危机的切实办法而只是老调重弹。
    议会辩论后，举行授权投票。表决结果，三百一十三票赞成，二百二十八票反对，皮杜尔没有获得宪法规定的多数票。
