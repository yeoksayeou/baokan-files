    "Ensure the Drilling Rig Never Stops Rotating!"
    Li Wenxian An Zizhen
    Large-scale economic construction cannot be separated from the support of farmers. The drilling workers of Team 221 of the Central Geological Department received tremendous support from the farmer brothers. Water sources were scarce here, and the drilling rig could not operate without enough water. For the drilling rig, water is like blood in the human body, and it cannot stop flowing even for a moment.
    At the beginning of January this year, the drilling rig installation project and the water channel project started simultaneously. The nearby farmers, with the mindset of supporting national industrial construction, expressed their willingness to help Team 221 build the water channel. Every morning, many people carrying hoes and shovels poured out of the mountains and fields. This was the water channel engineering team composed of farmers from nearby villages. They had to cross many mountains and deep gullies to extend the water pipes all the way to the airport on the mountain. However, the wind and snow on the plateau hindered their progress day and night. The ditch they had just dug during the day was filled with heavy snow and sandstorms at night. Day after day passed like this, and the water pipe could never reach the drilling rig. Seeing the rows of drilling towers, already erected on the hillside, unable to rotate due to lack of water, how anxious people were!
    The farmers began to fight against the wind and snow. Zhou Ding (a Communist Party member), the model ditch-digging team leader, braved the bitter cold of about minus thirty degrees Celsius, endured the piercing pain of the cold wind, jumped into the snow ditch that was neck-deep, and used a shovel to clear out the snow. Then, everyone jumped in one after another to clean the snow and lay the long water pipes. During this arduous project, many farmers had their hands and feet frostbitten, and many farmers had their ears frostbitten; however, the enthusiasm to support the country's large-scale economic construction became the power that encouraged them to overcome the cold. Finally, the water pipes were laid to every airport on the construction site. Water poured into the water tanks continuously, and the drilling machine started operating.
    One night at the end of March, when the 505 drilling machine was drilling smoothly, it suddenly stopped. It turned out that the water in the water tank had frozen, and some of the water pipes had burst. The workers had no choice but to melt the snow water, pour it into the drill pipe, and operate intermittently. Some stopped, and some barely rotated. After the farmers in each village heard the news, everyone immediately mobilized. The farmers in Chenjia Kiln beat drums and gongs, the men fed the livestock and prepared water buckets, and the women cooked and steamed dry food. The people drawing water at the well platform were so crowded that water couldn't leak through, and the buckets clanged loudly. Before dawn, farmers from nearby villages, carrying water buckets and leading donkeys, came to deliver water to the drilling machines that were too thirsty to operate. The weather was so cold that snowflakes fell on the ground and formed a thin layer of ice. Li Yumei, a woman from Shenjiazhuang, said, "We can't let the drilling rig lack water! I'll take the lead." She walked in front, using a three-pronged hoe to break the ice while spreading soil along the way, leading everyone to send water to the mountain.
    Some farmers who delivered water from their villages had to climb over two mountains and walk more than seven *li* to reach the airport. There was also a straight slope of more than forty degrees. The mountains were high and the road was slippery, making it very difficult to deliver water. The livestock were so tired that they were steaming all over, and they dared not lift their hooves on the ice and snow. The donkeys in front fell, and the donkeys behind rolled down the slope, making it impossible to move even a step. But when the farmers heard the buzzing sound of the drilling machine after it ran out of water, and looked at the donkeys that dared not take a step, they were all sweating with anxiety. Liu Qizhi, an army volunteer's relative in his fifties, said, "Folks, come on, unload the water buckets from the donkeys, and let's carry them up on our backs." Everyone carried the water up the mountain bucket by bucket, but unexpectedly, there were cracks in the formation, and the water seeped away as soon as it was poured down. They immediately took off the saddle pad pockets and carried clay to the top of the mountain. Everyone carried it for a day and a night, and finally plugged the cracks, and the drilling machine started operating again.
    The farmers supported the country's large-scale economic construction with such a selfless working attitude. Let the workers and farmers unite more closely to build our lovable and great motherland!

    “保证钻机一刻也不停止转动！”
    李文显  安子贞
    大规模的经济建设不能离开农民的支持。中央地质部二二一队的钻探工人就曾得到农民弟兄巨大的支援。这里水源缺乏，而钻机没有足够的水是不能开动的。对钻机来说，水就像人身上的血液，一刻也不能停息。
    今年一月初，钻机的安装工程和水道工程同时开始了。附近的农民抱着支持国家工业建设的心情，纷纷表示要帮助二二一队建设水道。每天早晨，满山遍野涌出很多带镐和铁锹的人们，这就是附近各村农民组成的水道工程队。他们要穿过许多山头和深沟，把水管一直修到山上的机场去。可是高原上的风雪，日夜阻碍着他们前进。白天刚把道沟挖成，夜晚又被大雪和风沙填满了。这样一天一天的过去，水管总是通不到钻机上。眼看着已经矗立在半山腰上的一排排的钻塔因为没有水而不能转动起来，人们是多么着急呀！
    农民们开始向风雪展开了斗争。模范挖沟组长周定（共产党员）在零下三十度左右的严寒里，忍着寒风刺骨的痛苦，跳到齐脖深的雪沟里，用铁锹把雪清理出来。接着，大伙儿一个跟着一个地跳进去，把雪弄干净，铺上漫长的水管子。在这项艰苦的工程中，有多少农民把手脚冻裂，有多少农民把耳朵冻伤；但是，支援国家大规模经济建设的热情，成了鼓舞他们战胜寒冷的力量。最后，水管终于铺到工地的各个机场上了。水滔滔不绝地注入水箱，钻探机开动起来了。
    三月底的一个夜晚，五零五钻探机正在顺利钻进的时候，钻探机忽然停住了。原来是水箱的水凝结了，有的水管冻崩了。工人只好把雪水化开，灌进钻杆里，时开时停。有的停住了，有的勉强转着。这个消息被各村农民听到以后，大家立时就动员起来了。陈家窑的农民打鼓敲锣，男的喂牲口，缥水桶，女的做饭蒸干粮。井台上提水的人们，挤得水洩不通，水桶碰得叮噹乱响。天还不明，附近村庄的农民们，担着水桶，牵着毛驴，给渴得不能开动的钻探机送水来了。天气是那样冷，雪花飘落在地上，结成一层薄冰。申家庄的妇女李玉梅说：“不能让钻机缺水！我领头走。”她走在头里，一面用三齿镐把冰划破，一面顺路撒土，带领着大伙把水送到山上。
    有的村送水的农民，把水送到机场要爬过两个山头，走七里多地，还有一段四十多度的直坡，山高路滑，送水是多么困难啊。牲口累得浑身冒热气，踏着冰雪不敢抬蹄，前边的毛驴跌倒了，后边的毛驴滚了坡，简直一步也不能行走。但是农民们听着钻探机缺水后发出的嗡嗡的叫声，再看看不敢迈步的毛驴，一个个都急得冒汗了。五十多岁的志愿军家属刘岐枝大伯说：“乡亲们，来吧，卸下毛驴上的水桶，咱们往上背吧。”大伙一桶一桶地把水背上山去，不料想地层有了裂缝，水倒下去，哗地一下就渗光了。他们马上就解下鞍子垫上的口袋，往山顶上背运粘土，大伙扛了一天一夜，总算把缝堵住，钻探机又重新开动起来了。
    农民们就是这样以忘我的劳动态度支援着国家大规模的经济建设。让工人和农民更亲密地团结起来，建设我们可爱的伟大祖国吧！
