Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, June 20th: The Korean-Chinese delegation to the Korean armistice talks issued the following communique on June 20th:

    Just ten days after the chief representatives of both sides signed the agreement on the repatriation of prisoners of war, and as the detailed preparations for the signing of the armistice agreement were nearing completion, the South Korean government and army, under the direct control of the US side, with the connivance of the US side and under the name of "release", arbitrarily detained nearly 26,000 of our captured personnel, and openly stated their intention to incorporate them into the South Korean army in order to achieve their goal of forcibly detaining prisoners of war and undermining the Korean armistice.

    On June 20th, our side requested a public meeting of the delegation. At the meeting, our chief negotiator, General Nam Il, read out a letter from Marshal Kim Il-sung, Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army, and General Peng Dehuai, Commander of the Chinese People's Volunteers, to General Clark, Commander-in-Chief of the United Nations Command, on June 19th. The full text is as follows:

    To General Clark, Commander-in-Chief of the United Nations Command:

    We have received your side's letter from General Harrison to General Nam Il of our side on June 18, 1953.

    In your letter, you stated that 25,000 North Korean prisoners of war detained in your prisoner-of-war camps Nos. 5, 6, 7, and 9 "escaped" from the prisoner-of-war camps on June 18th under the prior secret planning and meticulous coordination of the highest level of the South Korean government, with the assistance of South Korean security forces and outside forces. However, South Korea's Syngman Rhee has officially admitted that these prisoners of war were "released" on his orders by the South Korean security forces.

    Only ten days ago, both sides signed an agreement on the repatriation of prisoners of war, yet the South Korean government and army under your direct control have flagrantly and publicly violated this agreement. Under the so-called "release" order, through the internal and external coordination of secret agents, security forces, and outside forces, they coerced 25,000 people, accounting for more than half of the total number of prisoners of war not to be directly repatriated, to leave the prisoner-of-war camps, and openly stated their intention to incorporate them into the South Korean army in order to achieve their goal of forcibly detaining prisoners of war. Furthermore, this situation is still developing, with another 1,813 people forced to leave the prisoner-of-war camps on June 19th. Therefore, we cannot but consider the nature of this incident to be extremely serious.

    The South Korean Syngman Rhee clique has long been clamoring for "opposing the Korean armistice," "advancing north to unify the country," and "releasing all Korean prisoners of war who 'refuse' repatriation." You are not unaware of this issue. However, you have not taken any practical measures to prevent and stop the occurrence of this incident. This proves that you are intentionally condoning the Syngman Rhee clique to realize its long-planned conspiracy to sabotage the prisoner-of-war agreement and obstruct the realization of the armistice. We believe that you must bear the serious responsibility for this incident.

    Our side has repeatedly called your attention to the fact that your side's consistent propaganda of so-called "preventing the forced repatriation of prisoners of war" is completely fabricated and will not happen at all; on the contrary, the possibility of forcibly detaining prisoners of war exists and is increasing at all times, and therefore we must resolutely oppose it. The "release" and coercion of prisoners of war by Syngman Rhee that has now occurred proves that the forced detention that we oppose has further become an indisputable fact. And your side's consistently erroneous position and conniving attitude on this issue cannot but directly affect the outbreak of this incident and the implementation of the armistice agreement that is about to be signed.

    In view of the unusually serious consequences arising from this incident, we cannot but question your side: Can the United Nations Command control the South Korean government and army? If not, then does the Korean armistice include the Syngman Rhee clique? If it is not included, then what guarantee is there for the implementation of the armistice agreement on the South Korean side? If it is included, then you must be responsible for immediately recovering all 25,952 prisoners of war who have "escaped," that is, who have been "released" and coerced into detention and are prepared to be incorporated into the South Korean army, and guarantee that similar incidents will never happen again.

    We await your reply.

    Kim Il-sung, Marshal, Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army
    Peng Dehuai, Commander of the Chinese People's Volunteers
    June 19, 1953

    Attachment: Letter from the Chief Negotiator of the Opposing Side to the Chief Negotiator of Our Side on June 18th

    To General Nam Il, Chief Representative of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers Delegation:

    Between midnight and dawn today, approximately 25,000 North Korean prisoners of war who had refused repatriation after the armistice escaped from United Nations Command prisoner-of-war camps Nos. 5, 6, 7, and 9.

    Statements from senior officials of the Republic of Korea indicate that this action was secretly planned and meticulously coordinated by the highest level of the South Korean government. The prisoners of war received outside assistance when they collectively broke out of the camps. The Republic of Korea Army security forces stationed in the prisoner-of-war camps as guards did not attempt to stop this breakout. All evidence proves that there was actual collusion between the Republic of Korea Army guards and the prisoners of war.

    The Republic of Korea Army security guard forces used in prisoner-of-war camps holding anti-communist prisoners of war were considered particularly suitable because these prisoners of war had been cooperative in attitude while previously detained.

    The Republic of Korea Army security guard forces that have left their posts in the prisoner-of-war camps for non-repatriates are being replaced by the U.S. military.

    Efforts are being made to recover the prisoners of war who are now at large. As of 1:00 p.m. today, 971 escaped prisoners of war have been recovered.

    William K. Harrison, Jr., Lieutenant General, U.S. Army
    Chief Representative, United Nations Command Delegation
    June 18, 1953, at United Nations Command Forward Headquarters.

    金日成元帅和彭德怀将军致函克拉克
    要求立即全部追回被强迫扣留的战俘
    【新华社开城二十日电】朝鲜停战谈判朝中代表团六月二十日发表公报如下：
    正当双方停战谈判代表团首席代表签订了战俘遣返问题的协议仅仅十天以后，停战协定签字的细节准备工作即将完成之际，美方直接控制下的南朝鲜政府与军队，竟在美方纵容之下以“释放”为名，擅自扣留近二万六千名的我方被俘人员，并公开表示准备把他们编入南朝鲜军队，以达到他们强迫扣留战俘、破坏朝鲜停战的目的。
    六月二十日我方要求召开代表团大会的公开会议。会上，我方首席谈判代表南日大将宣读了我方朝鲜人民军最高司令官金日成元帅与中国人民志愿军司令员彭德怀将军在六月十九日致联合国军总司令克拉克将军的信件，全文如下：联合国军总司令克拉克将军：
    我们收到了你方哈利逊将军一九五三年六月十八日致我方南日大将的来信。
    你方在来信中说，被拘留在你方第五、六、七、九号战俘营里的朝鲜人民军战俘二万五千人，是六月十八日在南朝鲜政府最高级的事先秘密筹划和缜密配合之下，并得到南朝鲜警卫部队和外界的援助“越出”战俘营“逃”走的。可是，南朝鲜李承晚却已正式承认，这些战俘是他命令南朝鲜警卫部队“释放”的。
    仅仅在十天之前，双方才签订了关于战俘遣返问题的协议，而在你方直接控制之下的南朝鲜政府和军队，却已悍然地公开破坏了这个协议，在所谓“释放”的命令之下，经过特务、警卫部队和外界的里应外合的行动，胁迫占全部不拟直接遣返的战俘总数一半以上的二万五千人离开战俘营，并公开表示准备把他们编入南朝鲜军队里去，以达到其强迫扣留战俘的目的。并且这一情况还在继续发展，六月十九日又有一千八百十三人被迫离开战俘营。因此，我们对于这次事件的性质，不能不认为是极端严重。
    南朝鲜李承晚集团好久以来即在叫嚷着要“反对朝鲜停战”，“向北进攻，统一全国”，“释放所有‘拒绝’遣返的朝鲜战俘”。你方对于这一问题，不是不知道的。可是你方并未采取任何实际措施，来预防并制止这次事件的发生。这就证明你方是有意纵容李承晚集团去实现其久已蓄意的破坏战俘协议、阻挠停战实现的预谋。我们认为，你方必须负起这次事件的严重责任。
    我方早就一再提请你方注意：你方所一贯宣传的所谓“防止强迫遣返战俘”，完全是无中生有，根本不会发生的；相反地，强迫扣留战俘的可能性却是时刻存在着和增加着的，因而是我们所必须坚决反对的。现在发生的这次李承晚“释放”和胁迫战俘事件，证明我们所反对的强迫扣留已经进一步地成为不容置辩的事实。而你方在这个问题上历来所表现的错误立场和纵容态度，不能不直接影响这次事件的爆发和即将签字的停战协定的实施。
    鉴于这次事件所产生的异常严重的后果，我们不能不质问你方：究竟联合国军司令部能否控制南朝鲜的政府和军队？如果不能，那么，朝鲜停战究竟包括不包括李承晚集团在内？如果不包括在内，则停战协定在南朝鲜方面的实施有什么保障？如果包括在内，那么，你方就必须负责立即将此次所有“在逃”的、亦即被“释放”和胁迫扣留并准备编入南朝鲜军队中去的二万五千九百五十二名战俘，全部追回，并保证以后绝对不再发生同类事件。
    我们等待着你方的回答。
    朝鲜人民军最高司令官  元帅  金日成
    中国人民志愿军司令员  彭德怀
    一九五三年六月十九日
    附：对方首席谈判代表六月十八日给我方首席谈判代表的信朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军代表团首席代表南日大将：
    今天午夜与拂晓之间，约二万五千名曾拒绝于停战后被遣返的北朝鲜战俘越出联合国军第五、第六、第七与第九号战俘营。
    出自大韩民国高级官员的声明，显示这一行动曾经秘密筹划，并由韩国政府的最高一级加以缜密的配合。战俘们集体越营时，曾获得外来的援助。派驻在战俘营作为警卫的大韩民国军保安部队，没有设法阻止这一越营事件。一切证据证明大韩民国军的警卫与战俘间是实际串通的。
    在收容反共战俘的战俘营中所使用的大韩民国军保安警卫部队，曾被认为是特别适宜的，因为这些战俘以前在被扣禁时态度合作。
    已经离开其在不遣返者战俘营的岗位的大韩民国军保安警卫部队正由美军予以接替。
    正在尽力追回现在在逃的战俘。截至今天下午一时为止，逃亡战俘九百七十一名已被追回。
     联合国军代表团首席代表美国陆军中将  威廉·凯·哈利逊
    一九五三年六月十八日于联合国军前进基地总部。
