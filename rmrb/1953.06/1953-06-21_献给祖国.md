Dedicated to the Motherland
Written by Luo Jiannan for the Chinese People's Delegation to Korea for Literary and Artistic Performance

	The spring breeze blows across the Yalu River,
	The motherland's dear ones arrive at the front lines,
	Bringing warmth and hope,
	To chat with the soldiers during a brief respite.
	Seeing the faces of loved ones after a long separation,
	Everyone's heart is filled with warmth,
	As if seeing Chairman Mao,
	Or like seeing our fathers and mothers,
	A thousand words, ten thousand words are hard to express,
	Unsure of which to say first.
	Since crossing the Yalu River,
	We have been fighting at the front lines,
	The hundreds of millions of people of the motherland,
	Support us busily,
	Before summer arrives, single-layer clothing arrives,
	Before the weather turns cold, cotton clothing is sent,
	Donating airplanes and cannons,
	Guaranteeing our victory.
	Gratitude cannot be fully expressed,
	Please take these few words with you:
	Chairman Mao's teachings,
	We will always remember in our hearts,
	The motherland's people's entrustment,
	We will never forget.
	Ammunition depots are full, and granaries overflow,
	Our positions are like steel.
	Everywhere is like Shangganling,
	Everyone wants to be a hero.
	In order to see Chairman Mao,
	Strive to wear a military medal,
	When we meet in Beijing,
	We'll have a longer chat with our loved ones.

    献给祖国
    罗建南为中国人民赴朝慰问文艺工作团而作春风吹过鸭绿江，祖国的亲人到前方，带着温暖与希望，来和子弟叙短长。见了久别的亲人面，个个心里暖洋洋，好像见了毛主席，又像见了爹和娘，千言万语难说尽，不知先说那一桩。自从跨过鸭绿江，一直战斗在前方，祖国人民千千万，支援我们忙又忙，夏天未到单衣到，棉衣送来天未凉，捐飞机又捐大炮，保证我们打胜仗。感激的心情说不尽，几句话儿请带上：毛主席的教导，我们永远记心上，祖国人民的嘱托，我们永远不会忘。弹满库来粮满仓，我们的阵地钢一样。处处都是上甘岭，人人要把英雄当。为了去见毛主席，争取戴上军功章，北京城里见了面，再和亲人叙短长。
