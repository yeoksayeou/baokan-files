From Feeding Horses to Firing Cannons
Sun Jingrui

The day Pan Huiwen departed for Beijing to attend the “May 1st” International Labor Day celebrations, he bid farewell to the regimental leaders. On his way out, he ran into the regimental veterinarian. Upon seeing Pan Huiwen, the veterinarian happily said, "Comrade Pan Huiwen, take your good experience in feeding horses to Beijing and tell Chairman Mao!" Pan Huiwen replied with a smile, "It's not about the experience of feeding horses, but the experience of using cannons now." Pan Huiwen's answer astonished the veterinarian. How could someone who had been a horse feeder for more than four years suddenly start using cannons?

Actually, the time wasn't long, only a little over a year, but the changes in that year or so were enormous.

One night in January 1952, Pan Huiwen couldn't fall asleep. The scene from the mobilization meeting for cultural learning held during the day, and the words spoken by the instructor, were all clearly turning over in his mind. Li Chengming, a fellow horse feeder in his class, asked him, "What's wrong with you?" Pan Huiwen said, "This time we're going to have a cultural transformation! My family hasn't had anyone who could read for generations, and this time I'm going to study hard. Didn't you hear the instructor say that if you want to be a national defense soldier and master technology, you can't do without culture?" The next day, Pan Huiwen used his accumulated ten thousand yuan in allowance to buy a Golden Star fountain pen and a notebook for studying. Before classes even started, he went to the cultural teacher to learn the phonetic alphabet. The cultural teacher said, "What are you rushing for?" Pan Huiwen said, "You don't know how I feel! I wish I could learn culture all at once."

Everyone knew that the work of a horse feeder in a company was busy and tiring. They saw the moon at both ends of the day and had to feed a midnight meal of hay at twelve o'clock at night. Originally, three people fed seven horses, but not long after the cultural learning began, Li Chengming and Song Fu couldn't keep up and went to study after work. This meant that the task of feeding seven horses fell to Pan Huiwen alone. Many people said, "Pan Huiwen is bound to fall behind now!" However, not only did he not fall behind in cultural learning, but he also fed the horses until they were plump and strong.

The comrades in the company were all curious about how he studied. It turned out that he had arranged his work in advance. Take chopping horse grass for example, he chopped enough on Sundays to last for a whole week, which saved him time on weekdays for studying. He also seized the time to study during work hours. Take feeding the midnight hay as an example, feeding the horses required "grasping the hay and the feed," which took at least two hours. He would squat next to the trough, reading his book by the light of a small oil lamp. When he exercised the horses, he would squat on the hillside, writing characters on the ground with a grass stalk. Once, Pan Huiwen was on official business and was caught in a heavy rain on his way back from the city. He walked along, holding an umbrella and reading a book. He tripped over a stone and fell, getting covered in mud from head to toe, which made everyone laugh. Pan Huiwen got up from the mud and continued reading, saying, "If I stumble a little now, I won't stumble badly later."

Eventually, he fell ill from exhaustion. He was sick for five days but didn't say a word. One day in class, he felt like he couldn't hold on any longer. His head felt like it weighed a thousand pounds, and he couldn't lift his head from the desk for a long time. He thought: "Maybe I should rest for a day," but he immediately scolded himself: "I can't rest, if I rest I'll fall behind. I'm a Communist Party member, what difficulties can't I overcome!" He insisted on listening to the lecture. When he heard the teacher call his name, he just struggled to stand up to answer the question when he suddenly saw gold stars in front of his eyes and fell to the ground. When he woke up, the instructor and many comrades were surrounding him. The instructor said with a hint of reproach, "Why didn't you say you were sick sooner?" Pan Huiwen looked at the instructor's warm gaze and said, "The classroom is the battlefield, can a slightly wounded soldier leave the front line?" The instructor said, "It's not entirely comparable, you should rest when you're sick, otherwise you'll damage your body, which is even more not worth it." Li Chengming and Song Fu, standing behind the instructor, came over and held Pan Huiwen's hand tightly, saying with emotion, "You got sick for our sake! We will definitely study hard."

Ten months later, Pan Huiwen went from being illiterate to graduating from elementary school with a high level of culture. One day, the instructor called him to the company headquarters and said, "The higher authorities have decided to transfer you to the artillery training team to study. Pack your things and go!" When Pan Huiwen heard this, his heart pounded wildly. He thought: "They want me to be an artilleryman, can this be true?" But the instructor was already writing him a letter of introduction, and Pan Huiwen involuntarily said, "Instructor, I'm afraid I can't do it?" The instructor looked up and asked him, "Why?" Pan Huiwen said, "My cultural level is not high..." The instructor handed the letter of introduction to Pan Huiwen, shook his hand and said, "You are now a high school graduate."

During the first lesson at the artillery training team, when Pan Huiwen heard it, the military teacher was talking about "calculations," "markers," and "three-way mil formula," a set of things he had never heard of before, and he was immediately confused. He thought, "If I can't learn it, I'll go back to the company." But then he remembered the instructor's words: "Don't forget, you are now a high school graduate." He immediately strengthened his confidence, took out his pen, and wrote down what the military teacher said in his notebook. After class, he took out the military textbook to read and study it in comparison with his notes. If he really couldn't understand it, he would ask his comrades. If he couldn't do arithmetic, he couldn't learn artillery, so he asked platoon leader Jin Yuxian to teach him little by little. Once, he was squatting on the ground in the playground arranging pebbles. His comrades asked him, "What are you doing?" Pan Huiwen said, "I'm practicing multiplication and division!"

When he first started practicing mortar operation, from the cannon entering the position to calculating mil, angle, direction, finding markers, and until the spirit level bubble concentrated to zero... it took thirty minutes each time. As soon as he knelt in front of the cannon, sweat would come out. He thought that if the action was so slow on the battlefield, the enemy would have already attacked, how could he defend the motherland? He secretly made up his mind that no matter how physically tired he was, no matter how hot the southern sun was, he would use extracurricular activities and lunch breaks to carry the cannon to the playground, studying the military textbook while combining it with practical actions to practice hard. In less than a month, Pan Huiwen's aiming time had improved to only four minutes, and the time was still shortening day by day. He was so happy that he wrote a letter to his comrades in the company, saying, "With culture, it's easy to learn anything. I can now operate a cannon."

After graduating from the artillery training team with excellent grades, Pan Huiwen was promoted to deputy squad leader of the seventh squad of the mortar company this January. This is how people's soldiers grow up in the great cultural advance. Today, he is guarding the southern coast of the motherland, aiming the cannon at the turbulent ocean.

    从喂马到开炮
    孙景瑞
    潘惠文出发到北京参加“五一”国际劳动节观礼的那天，向团首长辞行出来，路上碰见了团部的兽医，兽医一见潘惠文，高兴地说：“潘惠文同志，把你喂马的好经验带到北京告诉毛主席吧！”潘惠文笑着回答道：“不是喂马的经验，是使炮的经验了。”潘惠文的回答叫兽医大吃一惊，怎么他当了四年多饲养员，忽然一下子使起炮来了呢？
    说起来时候不算长，才一年多，但这一年多的变化可太大了。
    一九五二年一月的一天夜里，潘惠文怎么也睡不着觉，白天举行的文化学习动员大会的情景，指导员讲的话，都清清楚楚地在脑子里转，同班的饲养员李成名问他：“你是怎么的了？”潘惠文说：“这一下子咱要来个文化大翻身啦！俺家几辈子都没有念过书，这一回我可要好好学。你没听指导员讲，想当国防军掌握技术，没文化不行。”第二天潘惠文就把积蓄起来的十万元津贴费，买了一枝金星钢笔和一个学习本子；还没开课，他就去找文化教员要学注音字母。文化教员说：“你忙啥呢？”潘惠文说：“你可不知道我的心呀，我恨不得一下子学好文化。”
    谁都知道一个连队的饲养员的活儿又忙又累，一天两头见月亮，夜里十二点还得喂一顿夜草。本来是三个人喂七匹马，文化学习开始不久，李成名和宋富两人赶不上，下班学习去了。这一来，七匹马的饲养工作可归了潘惠文一个人。许多人都说：“这下子潘惠文非掉队不行！”可是，他不但在文化学习上没有掉队，而且把马也喂得肉满骠肥。
    连里的同志都奇怪他是怎么学习的呢？原来他把工作事先都安排好：拿铡马草说吧，他在星期天铡出够吃一个星期的来，平日就省出时间来学习了。他还在工作时间抓紧学习，拿晚上十二点喂夜草说，喂马要“把草把料”，喂一顿起码花两个钟头，他就蹲在槽旁边守着小油灯念书。他蹓马时，也蹲在山坡上拿草棍在地上写字。有一回，潘惠文出公差，从城里回来赶上下大雨，他一边打着伞走，一边还拿着书念；一不留神叫石头绊了一个跟头，弄得混身上下满是泥水，惹得大伙都笑了。潘惠文从泥水里爬起来还是念书，他说：“现在栽个小跟头，以后可就不栽大跟头了。”
    到底，他累病了；他病了五天可没啃气。有一天上课，他觉得实在支持不了，脑袋像有一千斤重，爬在桌子上半天抬不起头来。他想：那么，休息一天吧，马上又自己责备自己：“不能休息，一休息就要掉队，我是共产党员，有什么困难克服不了呢！”他仍然坚持听课。当他听到教员叫他的名字时，刚想挣扎着站起来回答问题，突然觉得两眼冒金光，一头栽倒地上。他醒来时，指导员和许多同志都围着他。指导员有点责备似地说：“你怎么有病不早说呢？”潘惠文看了看指导员的温暖的眼光，说：“课堂就是战场，轻伤能下火线么！”指导员说：“不能完全这样比，有病是该休养的，不然身体坏了，就更不合算。”站在指导员背后的李成名和宋富，走过来紧紧握住潘惠文的手，感动地说：“你累病了也是为了我俩呀！我们一定好好学习。”
    十个月后，潘惠文由一字不识到语文高小毕业，文化水平飞快地提高了。一天，指导员把他叫到连部，说：“上级决定调你到炮训队学习，你收拾一下就去吧！”潘惠文一听，心里扑通扑通乱跳。心想：要我去当炮兵，这难道是真事吗？可是指导员已在给他写介绍信了，潘惠文不由自主地说：“指导员，我怕不行吧？”指导员抬头问他：“为什么？”潘惠文说：“我文化水平不高……”指导员把介绍信递给了潘惠文，握住他的手说：“你现在已是个高小毕业生了。”
    在炮训队上第一课时，潘惠文一听；军事教员讲的都是“计算”、“标杆”、“三道米位公式”等一套他头一次听说过的东西，他马上就蒙了。心想：“学不会就回连吧。”可是，他又想起了指导员的话：“不要忘记，你已是个高小毕业生了。”他立刻坚定了信心，掏出笔来，把军事教员讲的东西记在笔记本上。下课后，他又把军事教材拿起来读，和笔记对照着研究，实在弄不通的，就问同志。不会算术，学炮也不行，他就请排长金玉先一点一点地教。有一次，他在操场里蹲在地上摆碎石子，同志们问他：“你干啥呢？”潘惠文说：“我练习一下乘除法！”
    刚开始练习迫击炮操作时，从炮进入阵地到计算米位、角度、方向、找标杆一直到水平汽泡集中到零……每次都得三十分钟，只要在炮前一跪，汗就出来了。他想要是在战场上动作这样慢，敌人早打过来了，还怎么保卫祖国呢？他又暗暗地下了决心，不管身体多么疲乏，南方的太阳多热，他利用课外活动和中午休息时间，把炮扛到操场上，一边看军事教材研究，一边结合实际动作苦苦地练习。不到一个月，潘惠文的瞄准时间便进步到仅需四分钟了，而且，时间一天比一天还在缩短着。他高兴得给本连同志们写了封信，说：“有了文化，学啥都容易啦，我已能操纵一门炮了。”
    潘惠文在炮训队以优秀的成绩结业后，今年一月，升为迫击炮连七班的副班长。人民战士在文化大进军中就这样成长起来了。今天，他正守卫在祖国的南海岸上，把炮口对准了汹涌的海洋。
