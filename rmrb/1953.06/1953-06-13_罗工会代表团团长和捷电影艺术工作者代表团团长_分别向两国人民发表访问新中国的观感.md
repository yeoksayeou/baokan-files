Xinhua News Agency, June 11th: Romanian News Agency, Bucharest Dispatch: The Romanian Trade Union Delegation, which participated in the "May Day" celebrations in Beijing and the Seventh National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions this year, returned to Bucharest on the 9th. After returning to the country, the head of the delegation, Ni·Istrate, told a Romanian News Agency reporter about his impressions of visiting China: The heroic achievements of the Chinese working people and their abundant active strength gave us a deep impression. In China, new construction and the face of New China can be seen everywhere. At the Chinese Trade Union Congress, we witnessed the enthusiastic expression of the working people's love for the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong. The speakers at the conference all emphasized the great and multifaceted assistance of the Soviet Union to the construction of New China.

Xinhua News Agency, Prague, June 11th: Miroslav Fábera, the head of the Czechoslovak Republic Film Artists Delegation who was invited to China in April to participate in the "Czechoslovak Republic Film Week," wrote an article in the "Red Rights Daily" on the 7th, describing his impressions of visiting China. He praised the excellent organization of the film week and the effective preparation of the cities visited by the delegation, and expressed his gratitude to the Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China and the Chinese film workers for their hospitality.

Fábera wrote that we got along with Chinese film workers, writers, directors, actors, and cinematographers like our own brothers. They are very frank and sincere, and they are never tolerant of shortcomings. They are not complacent about the brilliant achievements that the Chinese film industry has made so far.

Fábera said in his article: The members of the delegation spoke with many Chinese people, and these conversations helped the members better understand the enormous changes that have taken place in China. The life experiences that these Chinese people talked about are all a picture of hardship, and the Chinese people have struggled out of this kind of suffering. The experience of each of their struggles proves that the path taken by the Chinese Communist Party under the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong is correct. Now the Chinese people are living in a joyful century. They do not know fatigue and are not afraid of any difficulties. They are so energetic and so full of the spirit of self-sacrifice, these impressions will live in our minds forever.

Fábera concluded: The main link of Czech-Chinese friendship that unites us with Chinese comrades is the love for the Soviet Union and the loyalty to the theories of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin.

    分别向两国人民发表访问新中国的观感
    【新华社十一日讯】罗马尼亚通讯社布加勒斯特讯：今年在北京参加“五一”节观礼和中国工会第七次全国代表大会的罗马尼亚工会代表团已在九日返抵布加勒斯特。代表团团长尼·伊斯特拉特返国后对罗马尼亚通讯社记者发表访华观感说：中国劳动人民的英雄业绩和他们的充沛的活动力量给了我们以深刻的印象。在中国，到处都可以看到新的建设和新中国的面貌。在中国工会代表大会上，我们亲眼看到劳动人民爱戴中国共产党和毛泽东主席的热情表现。大会上发言的人都曾强调指出苏联对新中国建设的巨大的多方面的帮助。
    【新华社布拉格十一日电】四月间应邀到我国参加“捷克斯洛伐克共和国电影周”的捷克斯洛伐克共和国电影艺术工作者代表团团长米罗斯拉夫·法贝拉返国后，在七日“红色权利报”上撰文，叙述访问中国的观感。他赞扬这次电影周的出色的组织工作和代表团所访问的各城市有效的准备工作，并对中华人民共和国中央人民政府文化部和中国电影工作者的招待表示感谢。
    法贝拉写道，我们和中国电影工作者、作家、导演、演员和摄影工作者相处，像亲兄弟一样。他们非常坦率诚恳，对缺点决不宽容，他们对于中国电影事业迄今所获得的辉煌成就，并不自满。
    法贝拉在他的文章里又说：代表团的团员们跟许多中国人谈过话，这些谈话帮助团员们更好地了解了中国所发生的巨大变化。这些中国人所谈到的自己的生活经历，都是一幅历尽苦难的图景，而中国人民就是从这种苦难中奋斗出来的。他们每个人奋斗的经历都证明中国共产党在毛泽东同志的领导下采取的道路是正确的。现在中国人民是生活在一个欢天喜地的世纪里。他们不知道疲倦，不怕任何困难。他们是那样精力充沛，是那样富于自我牺牲的精神，这些印象将永远活在我们的脑海里。
    法贝拉最后说：把我们和中国同志联结在一起的捷中友谊的主要纽带是对苏联的热爱，是对马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林学说的忠诚。
