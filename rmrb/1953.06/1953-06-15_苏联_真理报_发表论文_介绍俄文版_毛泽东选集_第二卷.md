Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, June 14th: The "Pravda" published an article on the 13th written by I. Prishevsky and A. Sobolev, introducing the Russian edition of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" Volume II. The article first pointed out: The Chinese Communist Party possesses rich and multifaceted experience in liberation struggles. Since its establishment, it has led many revolutionary battles, and in the course of these battles, it has united and tempered the strength of the great Chinese people year by year. The theoretical summary of the Chinese Communist Party's experience in leading the revolutionary movement is of great significance not only to Chinese comrades but also to communists in all countries under capitalist rule, especially to communists in colonial and semi-colonial countries. Comrade Mao Zedong, the organizer and leader of the Chinese Communist Party, gives a profound Marxist-Leninist analysis of the Party's activities in his works, scientifically demonstrating the Party's policies and tactics under various historical conditions.

The article then specifically introduced the historical background and content of each work in the Russian edition of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" Volume II. The article emphasized: These works are a program for defeating Japanese imperialism. The Chinese Communist Party creatively applied the theory of Marxism-Leninism to formulate the political line during the Anti-Japanese War, stipulating slogans that met the requirements of the times, and determining the ways and means to defeat Japanese imperialism. The Communist Party's clear and principled line on the issue of the national united front, its correct policies within this front, and its tireless struggle to popularize the united front turned the united front into a powerful weapon in the Chinese people's struggle for liberation, ensuring their final victory over Japanese imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries.

While introducing the military theory in "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" Volume II, the article said: Mao Zedong gave a Marxist-Leninist definition of the nature of the Anti-Japanese War, made a scientific analysis of the factors for the Chinese people's final inevitable victory, revealed the outstanding characteristics of the strategy and tactics of anti-Japanese military actions, and vividly pointed out the significance of guerrilla warfare in the entire chain of military operations. His research on the strategy and tactics of the Anti-Japanese War and guerrilla warfare is an important contribution to the theory of military art. The strategic and tactical principles of the Anti-Japanese War formulated by the Chinese Communist Party reflected the characteristics of the general revolutionary struggle of the people against foreign imperialist oppression and simultaneously striving for democratic revolution and democratic freedom. As the true organizer and leader of the people's war, the Chinese Communist Party mobilized the masses of the people to fight against the Japanese invaders, inspired the Chinese people with confidence in the victory of the struggle, and led them to a great victory.

The article then introduced the content of the struggle to consolidate the Communist Party ranks in "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" Volume II. The article said: The works in the second volume pay great attention to the issue of consolidating the Communist Party as much as possible organizationally and ideologically, and raising the ideological level and combat effectiveness of the Party ranks. In the struggle, the Chinese Communist Party fatally crushed the right-leaning opportunists, safeguarded the independence of the Communist Party in the united front, strengthened its ties with the masses and its vanguard role in the Anti-Japanese War, and became the recognized leader of the national liberation movement. Mao Zedong led the relentless struggle against any deviation from Marxism-Leninism, resolutely criticized dogmatism and empiricism, and achieved the creative application of theory to solve the urgent problems of the Chinese people's liberation struggle. "On Contradiction" played an outstanding role in theoretically opposing dogmatism and empiricism, and politically opposing the phenomenon of subjectivism. This work gave theoretical justification to the Party's policies, pointing out the harm of the vulgarization of Marxism to the work of the Chinese Communist Party.

The article concluded: Mao Zedong's works are a profound theoretical summary of the Chinese revolution's experience. These works further armed the Chinese Communist Party ideologically and theoretically, enhanced the Party's combat effectiveness, and strengthened the Party's leading role in the Chinese people's liberation struggle. These works have enriched the revolutionary theory of Marxism-Leninism.

    苏联“真理报”发表论文
    介绍俄文版“毛泽东选集”第二卷
    【新华社莫斯科十四日电】“真理报”十三日发表伊·普利歇夫斯基和阿·索波列夫写的论文，介绍俄文版“毛泽东选集”第二卷。论文首先指出：中国共产党拥有丰富而多方面的解放斗争经验。它自成立以来领导了许多次革命战斗，在这些战斗过程中一年比一年更加团结了和锻炼了伟大的中国人民的力量。中国共产党领导革命运动的经验的理论总结，不仅对于中国同志，而且对于一切处在资本统治下的国家的共产党员，特别是对于殖民地和半殖民地国家的共产党员，具有巨大的意义。中国共产党的组织者和领袖毛泽东同志，在自己著作中对于党的活动给予深刻的马克思列宁主义的分析，科学地论证了各种历史条件下党的政策和策略。
    论文接着具体地介绍了俄文版“毛泽东选集”第二卷各篇著作的时代背景和内容。论文着重指出：这些著作是战胜日本帝国主义的纲领。中国共产党创造性地运用马克思列宁主义的理论来制订在抗日战争时期的政治路线，规定符合时机要求的口号，确定战胜日本帝国主义的道路和办法。共产党在民族统一战线问题上的明确的有原则的路线，在这个战线内部的正确政策，以及争取统一战线的群众化的不倦的斗争，把统一战线变成了中国人民解放斗争的强大武器，保证了他们最后战胜日本帝国主义和国民党反动派。
    论文在介绍“毛泽东选集”第二卷中的军事理论时说：毛泽东对抗日战争的性质下了马克思列宁主义的界说，对于中国人民的最后必然胜利的因素作了科学的分析，他揭示了抗日军事行动战略与战术的突出特点，生动地指出了游击战在整个军事作战链条中的意义。他的关于抗日战争的战略和战术以及游击战等问题的研究，是对于军事艺术理论的重要贡献。中国共产党所制订的抗日战争的战略与战术原则，反映了反对外国帝国主义压迫并同时为实现民主革命、为民主自由而斗争的人民的普遍的革命斗争的特点。中国共产党作为全民战争的真正的组织者和领导者，动员了人民大众进行反对日本侵略者的斗争，以斗争胜利的信心鼓舞了中国人民，把他们引向了伟大的胜利。
    论文接着介绍了“毛泽东选集”第二卷中关于巩固共产党队伍的斗争的内容。论文说：第二卷中的著作，对于尽量在组织上和思想上巩固共产党，提高党的队伍的思想水平和战斗力的问题，给予很大的注意。中国共产党在斗争中致命地击破了右倾机会主义者，维护了共产党在统一战线中的独立性，加强了同群众的联系和自己在抗日战争中的先锋队作用，成为公认的民族解放运动的领导者。毛泽东领导了反对任何对马克思列宁主义的背离的无情斗争，坚决地批判了教条主义和经验主义，做到了创造性地运用理论去解决中国人民解放斗争的迫切问题。“矛盾论”在理论上反对教条主义和经验主义，在政治上反对主观主义现象的斗争中起了出色的作用，这一著作给党的政策以理论的论证，指明马克思主义的庸俗化对于中国共产党工作的害处。
    论文最后写道：毛泽东的著作是中国革命经验的深刻的理论的总结。这些著作进一步在思想上和理论上武装了中国共产党，提高了党的战斗力，并且加强了党在中国人民解放斗争中的领导作用。这些著作丰富了马克思列宁主义的革命理论。
