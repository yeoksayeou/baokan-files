    Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education's Reply Regarding Repeated Changes to the Graduation Time of the Normal School Spring Class

    Letter from the Jiangsu Provincial People's Government Department of Education: The criticism in the "Readers' Letters" column on May 12th regarding our department's repeated changes to the graduation time of the normal school spring class, resulting in confusion in teaching work, is correct. The facts are as follows: In the spring of 1952, the original Subei Cultural and Educational Office notified Yunhe Normal School to advance the graduation of the class originally scheduled to graduate in the spring of 1954 to the summer of 1953. During the winter vacation of the same year, our department received reports from Yunhe Normal School, Zhenjiang Normal School, and the Nanjing Municipal People's Government Education Bureau (forwarded from Nanjing Normal School and Xiaozhuang Normal School) requesting that the third-year spring class be advanced to graduate this summer. At that time, because the policy of rectifying and consolidating primary school education had been clarified, we believed that it was not necessary to graduate them early in order to ensure the quality of teachers, and we issued the relevant notice on February 24th. Later, we received instructions from the East China Education Bureau requiring our province to advance the graduation of the third-year spring class of normal schools. We repeatedly studied this issue and felt that primary schools needed to be rectified, and there were already many autumn class students graduating this year. If the spring class was graduated early, the problem might be more difficult to handle. We used a long-distance phone call to consult with the East China Education Bureau, suggesting that the third-year spring class should not graduate early. The East China Education Bureau did not approve. Therefore, our department notified the schools again on March 10th that the third-year spring class would still graduate early and adjusted the teaching plan. After that, we received a notice from the Central Government through East China that the third-year spring class should still graduate at the original scheduled time. At the same time, we also understood that it was indeed difficult for the schools to complete one year's curriculum in one semester, so on April 16th, we issued a fourth notice to various normal and junior normal schools that the third-year class would still graduate as scheduled and would not be advanced.

    In order to ensure the quality of teachers and thereby improve the teaching quality of elementary education, the decision to graduate the third-year spring class as scheduled is correct; however, the decision to graduate early was inconsiderate and improperly handled. The reason for this problem is, on the one hand, that our reporting of the situation to the higher authorities was not sufficient. When the higher authorities did not agree with our suggestion, we did not further reflect the situation and put forward opinions, but mechanically arranged for implementation. On the other hand, there were also erroneous ideas in the leadership of this province, believing that it would be difficult to solve the employment problems of these students if they graduated during the winter vacation, so it would be more convenient to solve them together in the summer. This frivolous working attitude is wrong. We are willing to accept this lesson and will earnestly improve our work in the future.

### 江苏省教育厅对反复变更师范春季班毕业时间的答复

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    江苏省教育厅对反复变更师范春季班毕业时间的答复
    江苏省人民政府教育厅来信：五月十二日“读者来信栏”所刊读者对本厅将师范春季班的毕业时间朝令夕改，致使教学工作发生混乱现象的批评是正确的。事实经过是这样：一九五二年春，原苏北文教处曾通知运河师范，将一九五四年春季毕业的班级，提前至一九五三年暑期毕业。同年寒假，我厅接到运河师范、镇江师范、以及南京市人民政府教育局转报南京师范、晓庄师范等校请示将三上春季班提前至今年暑期毕业的报告。当时因整顿巩固小学教育的方针已经明确，为了保证师资质量，我们认为不必提早毕业，并于二月二十四日发出该项通知。后接华东教育局指示，要我省将师范三上春季班提早毕业。我们反复研究了这个问题，觉得小学要整顿，而应届毕业的秋季班学生已经很多，再将春季班提早毕业，问题恐更难处理。我们曾用长途电话向华东教育局请示，建议三上春季班不必提前毕业。华东教育局未准。我厅故又于三月十日通知各校，三上春季班仍提早毕业，并调整了教学计划。此后又奉华东转中央通知，三上春季班仍应按原定时间毕业。同时也了解各校在一学期内完成一学年的课程，确有困难，于是又在四月十六日第四次通知各师范、初师春季班三上年级仍如期毕业，不予提前。
    为了保证师资质量，从而提高初等教育的教学质量，三上春季班如期毕业的决定是正确的；而提早毕业的决定，则是考虑不周和处置不当的。发生这一问题的原因，一方面是我们向上级反映情况还不够充分，上级不同意我们的建议时，又没有进一步反映情况，提出意见，便机械布置执行；另方面在本省的领导上也有错误思想，认为这些学生在寒假毕业，工作很难解决，不如在暑期里一起解决方便。这种轻率从事的工作态度是错误的。我们愿接受这次教训，并在今后工作中切实改进。
