    Situation
    In order to gain experience to guide the province's general election work, the Heilongjiang Provincial Election Committee formed four working groups on April 6, which went to Hailun, Zhaodong, Longjiang, and Baicheng counties respectively, and successively conducted pilot projects for basic-level primary elections in eight villages (including two villages inhabited by ethnic minorities) and a relatively complex district-level town, Changwu Town in Zhaodong County. The work lasted for a total of thirty-five days, ending on May 11.

    The total number of households in the eight villages was 1,619, with a population of 8,075, of which 4,325 were men and women over the age of eighteen, accounting for over 53 percent of the total population of the eight villages. Changwu Town had a total of 2,180 households, with a population of 10,004, of which 5,175 were men and women over the age of eighteen, accounting for over 51 percent of the total population. Since 1949, the eight villages have implemented the system of people's representative conferences, which have generally exercised the functions and powers of the people's congress, and elected village heads, deputy village heads, and government members. Changwu Town implemented the system of people's representative conferences in 1952, but did not exercise the functions and powers of the people's congress. In recent years, under the correct leadership of the Party and the higher-level People's Government, the political power construction in these villages and towns has made significant achievements. The people's representative conferences can generally be held on schedule, and the government's major tasks and the various demands and opinions of the people in their production and life can generally be submitted to the people's representative conferences for discussion and necessary decisions. In particular, issues related to agricultural production have been discussed, decided, and completed through the people's representative conferences in recent years. In recent years, these villages and towns have generally adhered to the system of re-election once a year, and some have been re-elected more than five times. In each re-election, the masses generally valued their right to vote, elected people they were satisfied with as representatives, exposed some bad people and bad deeds, and examined the government's work, thereby accumulating preliminary experience in democratic elections and laying a good foundation for the implementation of basic-level primary elections. However, on the other hand, due to insufficient democratic education in recent years, some village and town cadres have improperly used the system of people's representative conferences, have not respected the people enough, and have not fully promoted democracy. In particular, the publicity and education on primary elections has been very poor since this year, resulting in many people still having vague understandings of the people's congress system. Therefore, after the working group arrived, it carried out relatively widespread and in-depth publicity and mobilization work, generally achieving that every household knew and everyone was aware. More than 90 percent of the voters received education and valued their voting rights. According to the experience of this pilot project, the general ideological pattern of the masses is: not paying enough attention at the beginning of the primary election; after in-depth publicity and mobilization, generally understanding the significance of the primary election, but still some people have doubts, fearing that democracy cannot be truly implemented; until it is proved by facts that the primary election not only truly implements democracy, but also solves the problems that the masses urgently demand to be solved (such as a divorce case in the Thirteenth Village of Zhaodong County, which was unfairly judged by the court in the past, and in this primary election, the president of the County People's Court personally changed the judgment, made corrections and made a review at the mass meeting), the masses have a correct understanding of the primary election, and the enthusiasm for the primary election has greatly increased. According to the statistics of the eight villages, of the 4,174 people with voting rights, 3,352 people participated in the election, accounting for over 80 percent of the total number of voters. Because Changwu Town has little land, many people went to the villages to farm or went out to do odd jobs, so the participation in the election only accounted for over 68 percent of the total number of voters.

    In addition, according to the statistics of the eight villages, among the total of 156 representatives in 1953, there were 104 representatives from 1952 (re-elected), accounting for over 66 percent of the total number of representatives; 69 government members were re-elected, accounting for about 67 percent of the total number of original government members. If the original activists are added, the re-election rate of representatives and cadres is over 80 percent. These figures prove that our basic-level cadres are basically good and the basic-level organizations are basically pure; only individual cadres who have committed serious commandism and violations of law and discipline and a few representatives and cadres who are not supported by the people failed to be elected in this primary election.
      Work Steps
    The work steps are roughly divided into two stages. The first stage is divided into three steps. The first step is: in-depth publicity and mobilization work (including understanding the situation, establishing the election committee, and other preparations for the primary election, etc.), about four to five days. The second step is: population survey and voter registration (including mass ideological deliberation, determining registration stations, dividing election districts, and assigning personnel, etc.), about one to two days. The third step is: review of voter qualifications and nomination of representative candidates (including all meetings and symposium activities of the election committee and voter groups, and the announcement of the list of representative candidates, etc.), about three to four days. The first stage takes about ten days. The second stage is also divided into three steps. The first step is to conduct elections (including announcing the list of official candidates, deliberating on the election, and holding the election meeting, etc.), about three to four days. The second step is: convening the People's Congress (including collecting and handling proposals, making resolutions on major issues, and producing the government committee, etc.), about four to five days. The third step is: convening the government committee and ending the primary election (including implementing the resolutions of the People's Congress, rectifying the organization, revising the system, dividing the work of the members, and summarizing the primary election), about one day; two days in Changwu Town. The second stage takes about eight to nine days.
      First stage
    (A) Widespread and in-depth publicity and mobilization work. After the working group arrived in the villages and towns, it generally first participated in the local Party committee and branch meetings to explain the purpose and draft a list of candidates for the election committee members (to be passed by the People's Representative Conference or the Government Committee), and then organized forces to closely integrate with production and collect information on the masses' thoughts and production. For example, helping production mutual aid groups formulate plans, organizing spring plowing, and solving specific problems in spring plowing, etc., in order to promote production on the one hand and do a good job in the primary election on the other. Experience has proved that as long as the leadership is clear-headed and good at grasping the center, the primary election will not only not affect production, but will instead promote production due to the increase in the enthusiasm of the masses. The main characteristic of the rural areas in Heilongjiang Province this year is that some district and village cadres have a hasty and rash attitude towards the mutual aid and cooperation movement, and have wrongly adopted methods such as blindly forming large groups and expanding the share capital of cooperative members, which has dampened the production enthusiasm of some farmers. Based on this characteristic, the working group first convened meetings of Party members, Youth League members, propagandists, and activists in the villages and towns, or convened meetings of the People's Representative Conference and the Government Committee, to conduct policy make-up lessons, combine the explanation of the significance, policies, requirements, and practices of the primary election, and then further mobilize the propaganda forces, use all possible propaganda tools and propaganda opportunities, and carry out propaganda activities by district and responsibility.

    The main content of the propaganda focuses on the following points. First, what is a primary election? Why do we need a primary election? Explain the great significance, purpose, and requirements of the primary election, and at the same time affirm the achievements of the People's Representative Conference in the past, point out its shortcomings of insufficient democratic spirit, and explain that our country will carry out large-scale economic construction and implement national industrialization in the future, so it is necessary to implement the system of people's congresses at all levels through primary elections, so that our country can be further democratized. Second, what is the difference between this primary election and the village elections in the past? Mainly explain that this primary election will be combined with voter registration and population survey. The masses have many doubts about conducting a population survey. It is necessary to explain the role of the population survey in the national construction plan in combination with the actual situation of the masses. It is necessary to explain why voter registration is conducted and why the citizenship rights of some landlords and old rich peasants are restored. In addition to appropriately explaining Article 4 of Chapter 1 of the Election Law (namely: All citizens of the People's Republic of China who have reached the age of eighteen... have the right to vote and stand for election), it is also necessary to explain the provisions of the Government Administration Council's decision on the division of rural class components related to the change of landlord components. In order to mobilize the masses to review the landlords. Third, why nominate representative candidates? This issue must be fully explained, because the masses' understanding of the principle of democratic centralism is still very vague, understanding democracy as extreme democratization, and opposing leadership and democracy. Fourth, it should be explained that this primary election must be combined with the struggle against bureaucracy, coercion, and violations of law and discipline, but at the same time, it is necessary to enlighten the masses to make a comprehensive estimate of cadres with general shortcomings and prevent bias.

    In addition, in the publicity and mobilization work, special attention should be paid to mobilizing women. Generally, the villages first seize the activists among the women, clear their minds, and then hold various small symposiums or family visits for publicity and education. The content of the propaganda focuses on pointing out the close relationship between the primary election and the vital interests of women, conducting a comparison between the old and new societies, enlightening their sense of being masters of their own affairs, and combining the explanation of local female role models to encourage their enthusiasm for participating in the election.
    (B) Population survey and voter registration. This step is carried out by adopting the method of dividing villages and areas after relatively sufficient publicity and mobilization work. Because this is a new, meticulous, and complex work, the leadership is first required to pay attention to it and make full preparations. In addition to equipping registration personnel and making material preparations (such as registration forms, voter certificates, registration locations, paper, pens, etc.), the more important thing is the ideological preparation of the masses. Generally, mass meetings of resident groups (based on distance of residence or production mutual aid groups) are held separately on the evening before registration, focusing on explaining to the masses why a population survey and voter registration are conducted, what matters should be paid attention to during the registration process, what attitude should be taken, etc., and mobilizing the masses to discuss and deliberate.

    Secondly, the leadership must also initially grasp the situation of the landlords. The method is to first conduct preliminary research by the election committee to determine the objects to be deprived of the right to vote, and then hand it over to the review team for evaluation. The advantage of this is that it saves the review team's time and avoids an excessively wide scope of deprivation. In the process of investigation and registration, the method of centralized registration is generally adopted according to the election district. The advantage is that it saves time and energy, reduces omissions, and is also convenient for comparison to prevent false reports; in order to take care of the production time of the masses, it is generally advisable to conduct it in the rural areas after lunch and in the evening. According to the residential situation, the order of the registration time should be determined and registration should be carried out in batches and at different times to avoid crowding and fatigue for the masses. The registration station generally has five to six people, divided into three groups, two groups for population survey, and one group for voter registration, with two people in each group, one registering the name and the other checking the age comparison table. In this way, a village of about 200 people can complete the entire investigation and registration work in two hours.

    In addition, necessary education and explanation work should also be carried out during the registration process. The general working people should be told that the people should not have any concealment from their country, and those who concealed or falsely reported their age in the past should change it this time; single households and those living with neighbors should set up separate household registrations; the population of those who have gone out and the permanent residents should be strictly distinguished. Landlords or counter-revolutionaries who have restored their civil rights should be encouraged to continue to seek progress, expose bad people, and get close to the government. Those who have been deprived of the right to vote should be told the reasons, and if they disagree, they can appeal to the election committee or the people's court. For new households that have moved in, if the situation is unclear, it is best to tell them to quickly obtain proof from the original place of emigration, and only register the population temporarily, and not issue voter certificates, and determine it before the election; if the place of origin of the immigrant household is too far away to obtain proof in a short time, and no one in the local area can prove that they are bad people, they should still be allowed to conduct voter registration and issue voter certificates to participate in the election before the election.

    The key issue in population survey and voter registration is to clarify the population and ensure the age. The main types of concealment and omissions in the population are: (1) Intentional concealment is mainly by fleeing reactionary landlords and counter-revolutionaries, whose families intentionally conceal and do not report; but there are also individual households who are afraid of apportioning expenses according to the population and deliberately conceal and do not report the population.
    (2) Underreporting due to "carelessness," such as forgetting to report the population of those who have gone out, the elderly, the weak, the disabled, and newborn children, etc. (3) Widows, widowers, and individual households living in remote areas are also easily overlooked.

    Population figures are easy to make mistakes, and they must be repeatedly checked to obtain accuracy. Therefore, statistical work is necessary after investigation and registration. Statistical work should be the responsibility of a dedicated person. In urban areas where the population is concentrated, as many technical cadres as possible should be mobilized (after a certain period of training) to participate.
       (C) Review of voter qualifications and nomination of representative candidates. This step is an important link in the primary election process, and democracy must be fully promoted while tightly grasping the policies. The practice in each village is to first repeatedly discuss and determine the matter through the branch meeting (Party committee) and the election committee, then repeatedly discuss and review it by the masses, and then finalize and announce the matter.

    When reviewing voter qualifications, attention should be paid to cultivating backbones and activists in advance in order to better grasp the overall situation of landlords and other people and provide necessary materials for the review team. However, in order to ensure that "we cannot allow a reactionary element or a landlord class element whose components have not been changed to illegally steal the solemn political rights, nor can we allow a citizen to be wrongly deprived of the solemn political rights," each village adopted the method of combining the review by the review team, the close cooperation of the public security department, and the full discussion of the voter groups. This not only fully promoted democracy, but also tightly grasped the policies. The nomination of representative candidates is generally better with joint nominations (of course, individual nominations are also possible). In areas inhabited by ethnic minorities, joint nominations and joint elections are also appropriate. Individual nominations and separate elections are more likely to cause ethnic estrangement (for example, some ethnic minorities in Xinfacun, Longjiang County, mistakenly believe that the coalition government is formed by the Han and ethnic minorities establishing their own governments and then uniting, or that the establishment of a coalition government does not fall under the leadership of the district, but is uniformly under the leadership of the ethnic minority area, etc.). After the review of voter qualifications and the nomination of representative candidates, the list is announced separately and a notice is issued in the name of the election committee. The form of the announcement should have a legal basis in order to attract the attention of the masses. In urban areas, because the population is large and the area is large, the election districts do not know the representative candidates well. Therefore, when announcing the list of representative candidates, the resumes, advantages, and disadvantages of the candidates should also be printed and distributed to each voter group for discussion, so that the masses can fully familiarize themselves with the situation of the representative candidates.

    When reviewing the voting rights of landlords, the masses should be educated to proceed from a policy perspective and pay attention to preventing the "deduction," "digging," "chasing," and "forcing" of landlord elements, forming a second struggle phenomenon. Reviewing voter rights is an extremely serious task, and it is necessary to emphasize seeking truth from facts, paying attention to policies, and not arbitrarily putting on "hats." When it is found that there is a discrepancy between the facts and the deprivation of democratic rights, the person should be found for a conversation, repeatedly verified, and allowed to appeal to the election committee and the people's court. The election committee and the people's court should be cautious, and prevent both "preconceived notions" and laissez-faire, not adding leadership or making hasty decisions. In addition, when reviewing voter qualifications, it is also necessary to combine it with the work of cleaning up control, re-examine it through the public security department, and announce control for those who should be controlled but have not been controlled, and immediately correct those who have been wrongly controlled.

    After the first stage of work was completed, the working group transferred to other villages, leaving the cadres of the People's Court to continue working. The tasks left to them were: to collect the opinions and requirements of the masses, accept appeals, and discuss with the election committee to resolve them in a timely manner. At the same time, in conjunction with deliberating on the list of representative candidates, assist the village and town cadres in preparing the summary work report, review and revise the production plan, and prepare for the next stage of elections and convening the People's Congress.
      Second stage
       (A) Conduct elections. Before the election, the Party branch and the election committee need to do a good job of preparation. The main task is to further collect the voters' opinions on the representative candidates and finally determine the official list of representative candidates, and at the same time announce the election time, location, etc.

    When the voter groups discuss the list of representative candidates, they should especially fully discuss the candidates in their election district in order to concentrate the votes during the election. At the same time, it is also necessary to clearly explain the matters that should be paid attention to in the election, such as the time, location, method (how many votes or how many hands to raise for several candidates, only less and not more), discipline, carrying the voter certificate, etc. Members of the election committee should have a division of labor and bear the election responsibility in each election district.

    At the beginning of the election meeting, the election discipline should be solemnly announced, a special person should be designated to register the number of participants in the election, maintain order, and elect the presidium. The election can only be officially held when more than half of the voters are present. The presidium focuses on explaining the election methods and procedures to the masses, and specifically introduces the resumes, advantages, and disadvantages of the representative candidates in the election district (the time should not be too long), and then solicits everyone's opinions. If there are no opinions, the election will be held. If there are opinions or someone temporarily proposes another candidate, and someone seconds the proposal, the presidium should first put the newly proposed candidate to a vote, and if the majority agrees, the candidates of the same class as the newly proposed candidate should be put to a vote, as well (if the newly proposed candidate is a woman, one of the existing women candidates should be put to a vote, and other representative candidates who are not women will still be official representative candidates). Finally, one person is determined as the official candidate before the election is held, in order to ensure the original total number of representative candidates of each class. In particular, it is necessary to ensure the election of representative candidates of each class in urban areas. After the election is over, the ballots are reviewed and counted, and the results are announced on the spot and representative certificates are issued. The election method generally adopts a show of hands. However, in order to take care of the special circumstances of voters, such as serious illness and pregnant women, a staggered election method is also adopted, that is, a portion of the ballots is issued, and the supervisors go to the voters to collect the votes.
    (B) Convening the People's Congress. According to our experience, the content of the basic-level People's Congress should be: seriously summarizing the government's work, launching criticism and self-criticism, evaluating the merits and demerits of cadres, and conducting a struggle against bureaucracy, coercion, and violations of law and discipline through the summary of work in order to educate cadres, but also preventing any phenomenon of struggling against cadres.

    The second is to review the production plan (most villages have already made a production plan) and review the implementation of the plan. It is best to combine the typical speeches of the production cooperatives or good production mutual aid groups for full discussion and make necessary decisions.

    The third is to solve the problems that the masses urgently demand to be solved. For example, in Dongfeng Village, Hailun County, the village finance was very chaotic and corruption was serious, and the masses urgently demanded to reorganize the village finance. The representative meeting made a resolution to start the reorganization, and the masses responded well. Other general proposals and requirements should also be assigned to special personnel to be responsible for assisting the representatives in reviewing and handling them, so that each case has a landing place and each matter has an explanation. If there are too many proposals and all of them cannot be processed at one time, a proposal processing team should be established to assist the government in handling them after the meeting.

    As for the production of government members, in principle, they are elected by the people's representatives, but in order to fully promote democracy, the method of first proposing a list of candidates by the election committee, deliberating by the voters, and then electing them by the people's congress is adopted, which can better reflect public opinion and comply with the spirit of the election law. This practice is very popular among the masses.

    Finally, the presidium of the conference should form a leadership core (after the presidium is elected, the election committee is declared over), which is the key to holding a successful People's Congress. The presidium must rely on the representatives, fully promote democracy, and cannot take over everything, but it must also be good at grasping the center, controlling the time, and solving problems. The conference time should not be too long, generally one day is appropriate; urban areas should not exceed two days at most.
       (C) Convening the government committee to end the primary election. The new government committee should discuss how to implement the resolutions of the People's Congress and clarify the responsibilities of the People's Congress and the government committee. Revise and supplement various necessary systems. It should also be determined that the village and town people's congresses will be held once a month, the government committee will be held once every half month, and temporary people's congresses can be held for major issues. The government committee should report its work to the People's Congress on a regular basis, especially the financial revenue and expenditure situation, which must be announced on a monthly and quarterly basis and approved by the People's Congress.

    In order to better concentrate forces to do a good job in production and overcome the phenomenon of "five more," the government committee must also combine the rectification of organizations, mainly the villages and towns below the village, street groups, and mass organizations. In addition, it is necessary to do a good job in the aftermath, summarize the primary election, compile statistical reports, and summarize and report them.
    Several main experiences
       (1) Do a good job of preparation. The first is ideological preparation, especially the ideological preparation of the leadership is very necessary. Because the People's Representative Conference system has been implemented in Heilongjiang Province for many years, not only has it achieved certain results, but it has also gained some experience, which can easily make some leading cadres satisfied with the status quo and produce negative emotions. In particular, the primary election period is during the busy farming season, which can easily make some cadres relax their leadership of this work. Therefore, the first requirement is that the leadership ideology fully recognizes the great significance and complexity of this primary election. Only when the leadership ideology is fully prepared and the leadership is strengthened in actual actions can the smooth completion of the primary election work be guaranteed. The second is the preparation of cadres. Some of the cadres in this working group have not undergone good training, which has led to many problems in the work. Some cannot grasp the policies and form an excessively wide scope of deprivation; some do not know how to follow the mass line. Especially during the population survey, more mistakes occurred in Changwu Town, and agencies and enterprises did not fill out household registrations at the same time, which wasted a lot of time. The third is that the material preparation work should be done well. The voter certificates in Changwu Town were not enough, and voter certificates were not issued during voter registration, and they were reissued later, which was very messy.

    (2) Do a good job of publicity and mobilization. The main experiences are: (A) First, do a good job of training backbones (including village, town, street, and group cadres, etc.). (B) Carry out comparative education based on the masses' thoughts, combined with the masses' own interests and personal experiences. This is the easiest propaganda method to penetrate the hearts of the people and is readily accepted by the masses. (C) The propaganda forms should be diverse. The meeting time should not be too long, generally it is appropriate to hold small meetings in the evening, and attention should also be paid to regional division of labor. (D) "Propagandize what you do." That is, to carry out propaganda closely following the work steps, which is more effective.
       (3) Promote democracy with leadership. First of all, the masses must clearly understand what "democracy" means and what "democratic centralism" means in order to avoid the tendency of extreme democratization. How to implement democracy with leadership? (A) The Party branch, the original basic-level organizations of the village (town), and the election committee explain the policies to the cadres on major issues related to the primary election, so as to avoid confusion due to lack of understanding of the policies. (B) On the premise of leadership, boldly promote democracy, and conduct an evaluation of the merits and demerits of cadres in conjunction with the struggle against bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of law and discipline. Only by carrying out mass criticism and self-criticism can the relationship between cadres and the masses be further close, and the political enthusiasm of the masses can be further improved. Experience has proved that combining the primary election with the struggle against bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of law and discipline not only enriches the content of the primary election, but also greatly improves the prestige of the People's Congress and the government, and further strengthens the connection between the government and the people. (C) Conscientiously and responsibly treat people's proposals. This is also an important aspect of implementing full democracy with leadership. According to the statistics of Chenshi Village and other four villages and one town in Hailun County, there were more than 600 people's proposals. People's proposals must be taken seriously, and the representatives should be informed of those that need to be investigated and understood before being processed; those that can be resolved with general opinions and requirements should be resolved immediately; those that cannot be resolved should also explain the reasons, and those that will be handled slowly should also be explained. It is necessary to ensure that each proposal has a landing place and an explanation in order to further strengthen the relationship between the government and the masses and make the masses infinitely trust their government.

    (4) Closely combine with production and effectively solve the urgent problems of the masses. The first is to take care of the production time of the masses, cherish the people's strength, and make full use of the production gap and evening time for all propaganda, meetings, and other activities related to the primary election. The second is to start from the specific situation, find out the main links in production and the main contradictions in the villages and towns, especially the main problems hindering the smooth progress of the primary election, and solve them. For example, Chenshi Village in Hailun County solved the problem of the masses lacking bean seeds, and Shengli Village and Taiping Village in Baicheng County organized the masses to dig wells to fight drought; the Eighth Village in Zhaodong County tightly grasped the production actions and combined it with the rectification of the branch to transform the political power; the Thirteenth Village handled the wrongly judged divorce case that hindered the smooth progress of the primary election, which strongly supported the primary election and promoted spring plowing. The third is the leadership issue of combining the primary election with production. It is generally better to adopt the method of dividing the work of cadres, and propagandize (including understanding the situation) in the group (production mutual aid group) in the evening, and then follow the group to the fields to help production during the day. Fourth, the main village cadres should be divided into separate leaders for production and primary election to ensure that both production and primary election are not neglected.

    黑龙江省基层普选试点工作的情况和经验
    黑龙江省选举委员会
    情况
    为了取得经验，指导全省普选工作，黑龙江省选举委员会在四月六日组成四个工作组，分别到海伦、肇东、龙江、白城四县，先后试办了八个村
    （其中有两个少数民族聚居村）及一个情况比较复杂的区级镇——肇东县昌五镇的基层普选。工作时间共三十五天，到五月十一日结束。
    八个村的总户数是一千六百一十九户，八千零七十五人，其中男女十八周岁以上的有四千三百二十五人，占八个村人口总数的百分之五十三强；昌五镇总户数是二千一百八十户，一万零四人，其中男女十八周岁以上的有五千一百七十五人，占人口总数的百分之五十一强。八个村自一九四九年以来，都实行了人民代表会议制度，并普遍地代行了人民代表大会职权，选举了正副村长和政府委员；昌五镇在一九五二年实行人民代表会议制度，没有代行人民代表大会职权。几年来，在党与上级人民政府的正确领导下，这些村镇的政权建设工作已有显著成就，人民代表会议一般都能按期开会，每个时期政府的重大工作以及人民群众生产生活中的各种要求与意见，一般的都能提交人民代表会议讨论，并做出必要的决定。特别是有关农业生产问题，几年来都是通过人民代表会议讨论决定和完成的。几年来这些村镇一般都坚持了一年一次的改选制度，有的改选了五次以上。在每次改选中，群众一般都重视了自己的选举权利，选举了自己满意的人当代表，揭发了一些坏人坏事，检查了政府工作，从而积累了民主选举的初步经验，为实行基层普选打下了良好基础。但是另一方面，几年来由于民主教育不够，部分村镇干部运用人民代表会议制度不当，尊重人民代表不够，以及充分发扬民主不足，特别是今年以来关于普选的宣传教育很差，以致部分群众对人民代表大会制度仍有很多模糊认识。为此，工作组到达后，即进行了比较普遍和深入的宣传动员工作，一般做到了家喻户晓，人人皆知。百分之九十以上的选民受到了教育，重视了自己的选民权利。根据这次试点经验来看，群众的思想规律一般是：普选开始时不够重视；经过深入的宣传动员之后，一般都懂得了普选的意义，但还有一部分群众有怀疑，怕不能真正实行民主；及至从事实中证明普选不仅真正实行民主，而且还解决了群众迫切要求解决的问题（如肇东县十三村一件离婚案件，过去法院判得不公，这次普选中，县人民法院院长亲自改判，得到改正并在群众大会上作了检讨），群众对普选有了正确认识，对普选的热情大大提高。根据八个村的统计，有选民权利的四千一百七十四人，参加选举的三千三百五十二人，占选民总数的百分之八十强。昌五镇因为土地少，很多人都下屯种田或出外打零工，因而参加选举的只占选民总数的百分之六十八强。
    此外根据八个村的统计，一九五三年一百五十六名代表总额中，有一九五二年的代表（连选连任）一百零四名，约占代表总数的百分之六十六强；政府委员中有六十九名是连选连任的，约占原政府委员总数的百分之六十七。如果加上原有积极分子，则代表与干部连选连任的均达百分之八十以上。这些数字证明我们基层干部基本上是好的，基层组织基本上是纯洁的；只有个别犯有严重的命令主义与违法乱纪分子和少数为人民所不拥护的代表与干部，才在这次普选中落了选。
      工作步骤
    工作步骤大体上分作两个阶段。第一阶段分作三步。第一步是：深入的宣传动员工作（包括了解情况，成立选举委员会及普选的其他准备工作等），约四至五天。第二步是：人口调查、选民登记（包括群众思想酝酿，确定登记站，划分选区，配备人员等），约计一至二天。第三步是：选民资格审查和代表候选人的提出（包括选举委员会及选民小组的一切会议、座谈活动及代表候选人名单的公布等），约计三至四天。第一阶段共需十天左右。第二阶段也分作三步。第一步是进行选举（包括公布正式候选人名单，酝酿选举，选举大会等），约计三至四天。第二步是：召开人民代表大会（包括搜集处理提案，对重大问题作出决议，产生政府委员会等），约计四至五天。第三步是：召开政府委员会，结束普选（包括贯彻执行人民代表大会的决议，整顿组织，修订制度，委员分工，总结普选），约计一天；昌五镇两天。第二阶段共需八至九天。
      第一阶段
    （甲）普遍深入的宣传动员工作。工作组到达村、镇后，一般是首先参加当地的党委会和支部会，说明来意，拟定选举委员会委员候选人名单
    （在人民代表会议或政府委员会通过），然后组织力量，密切结合生产，搜集群众思想情况和生产情况。如帮助生产互助小组制订计划，组织春耕，解决春耕中具体问题等，以便一面推动生产，一面搞好普选。经验证明，只要领导上头脑清醒，善于抓住中心，普选不但不会影响生产，相反的由于群众积极性的提高，还会推动生产。今年黑龙江省农村中的主要特点，是部分区村干部对互助合作运动抱着急躁冒进情绪，错误地采取盲目编大组、扩大社员股金等作法，挫伤了一部分农民的生产积极性。根据这一特点，工作组首先召开村镇党、团员、宣传员、积极分子会议，或是召开人民代表会议和政府委员会议，进行政策补课，结合讲解普选意义、政策、要求和作法，然后进一步发动宣传力量，利用一切可能利用的宣传工具和宣传机会，分区负责地展开宣传活动。
    宣传内容主要抓住以下几点。一、甚么叫普选？为什么要普选？说明普选的重大意义、目的和要求，同时肯定过去人民代表会议的成绩，指出它的缺点是民主精神不足，说明今后我们的国家要进行大规模经济建设，实行国家工业化，因此就必须实行普选的各级人民代表大会制度，使我们国家进一步民主化。二、这次普选和过去的村选有什么不同？主要说明这次普选要结合进行选民登记和人口调查。群众对进行人口调查有不少疑惑。必须结合群众的实际情况解释人口调查对国家建设计划的作用。要讲解为什么要进行选民登记，恢复一部分地主、旧富农公民权，除了将选举法第一章第四条（即：凡年满十八周岁之中华人民共和国公民……均有选举权和被选举权）适当加以说明外，还必须将政务院关于划分农村阶级成分的决定中有关地主改变成份的规定加以说明。以便发动群众对地主进行审查。三、为什么要提代表候选人？这个问题必须加以充分的说明，因为群众对民主集中制的原则认识还很模糊，把民主了解为极端民主化，把领导与民主对立起来。四、说明这次普选一定要结合反官僚主义，反强迫命令，反违法乱纪的斗争，但同时需要启发群众对有一般缺点的干部要作全面估计，防止发生偏向。
    此外，在宣传动员工作中，应特别注意发动妇女的问题。各村一般是先抓住妇女中的积极分子，打通她们的思想，然后召开各种小型座谈会或家庭访问进行宣传教育。宣传内容是着重指出普选对妇女的切身利害关系，进行新旧社会的对比，启发她们的主人翁感觉，结合讲解当地的妇女模范人物，鼓舞她们参加选举的热情。
    （乙）人口调查与选民登记。这一步是在经过比较充分的宣传动员工作之后，采取分屯分片方法进行的。由于这是一个新的而又细致复杂的工作，因此首先要求领导方面加以重视，并充分作好准备工作。准备工作中除配备登记人员和作物质准备（如登记表格、选民证、登记地点、纸、笔等）外，更重要的是群众思想准备。一般是在登记前晚间分别召开居民小组（根据居住远近情况或按生产互助小组）的群众会，向群众着重说明为什么要进行人口调查与选民登记，登记过程中应当注意那些事项，应抱什么态度等，发动群众讨论酝酿。
    其次，领导方面还必须初步掌握地主的情况。作法是先经选举委员会初步研究，确定被剥夺选举权的对象，然后交给审查小组评定。这样好处是既可节省审查小组的时间，又可避免剥夺面过宽。在调查登记过程中，一般是按照选区采取集中登记办法。好处是既可节省时间、精力，又可减少遗漏，同时还便于评比，防止虚报假报；为了照顾群众的生产时间，一般以在农村午饭后和晚间进行为宜。还应根据居住情况，确定登记时间的先后，分批分时登记，免得群众拥挤和疲劳。登记站一般是五至六人，分三个组，人口调查两个组，选民登记一个组，每组二人，一人登记姓名，一人查年龄对照表。这样，二百人左右的屯子，两小时即可全部结束调查登记工作。
    此外，在登记过程中还应进行必要的教育和解释工作。对一般劳动人民群众应当说明人民对自己的国家不应当有任何隐瞒，过去隐瞒谎报年龄的这次应当更改；独身户和邻家同居的，应当另立户口；外出人口和常住人口要严格分清。对地主或反革命分子恢复公民权者，应当鼓励他们继续求进步，揭发坏人，靠近政府。对被剥夺选民权利的，应当说明原因，如不同意可向选举委员会或人民法庭申诉。对新迁入的户，情况不明时，最好告诉他赶快取得原迁出地人民政府的证明，暂时只登记人口，不发给选民证，待选举时再行确定；如迁入户原地过远，一时取不到证明，而当地又无人证明其为坏人时，选举前仍应允许他进行选民登记并发给其选民证，参加选举。
    人口调查与选民登记的关键问题在于把人口弄清楚，年龄弄确实。在人口上隐瞒遗漏的情况，主要有以下几种：（1）有意隐瞒的主要是逃亡的反动地主和反革命分子，其家人有意隐瞒不报；但也有个别户怕按人口摊花销，故意隐瞒人口不报。
    （2）由于“马虎”少报的，如忘报外出人口、老弱残废和初生小孩等。（3）孤寡及个别居住偏僻户，也很容易被遗漏。
    人口数字很容易弄错，必须反复查对，才能求得准确。因此，调查登记之后统计工作是必要的。统计工作要有专人负责。城镇人口集中，应尽可能多动员一批技术干部（事先经过一定时间的训练）参加。
       （丙）选民资格的审查和代表候选人的提出。这一步是普选过程中的重要环节，必须充分发扬民主，而又紧紧地掌握政策。各村的作法是，先经支部会（党委会）、选举委员会反复讨论确定，再经群众反复讨论审查，然后定案公布。
    在审查选民资格时，事先应注意培养骨干和积极分子，以便更好地掌握地主等的全面情况，为审查小组提供必要的材料。但是为了“我们不能听任一个反动分子或未经改变成分的地主阶级分子非法窃取了庄严的政治权利，我们也不能听任一个公民被错误地剥夺了庄严的政治权利”，各村采取了审查小组审查，公安部门紧密配合，选民小组充分讨论三者结合进行的办法，这样既充分发扬了民主，而又紧紧地掌握了政策。代表候选人的提出，一般以联合提名较好（当然也可以单独提名），少数民族聚居地区也以联合提名，联合选举为宜，单独提名，分别选举，反易引起民族隔阂（如龙江县新发村有的少数民族误认为联合政府是汉人和少数民族各自成立政府后再联合，或认为成立了联合政府就不归本区领导，统一归少数民族区领导等）。选民资格审查和代表候选人提出之后，即分别公布名单，以选举委员会名义发布公告。公告形式应有法律根据，以便引起群众的重视。在城镇因为人口多、地面大，选区对代表候选人多不认识，因此，公布代表候选人名单同时，还应将候选人的简历与优缺点印发各选民小组讨论，以便使群众全面熟悉代表候选人情况。
    在审查地主选民权利时，要教育群众从政策观点出发，注意防止对地主分子的“扣”、“挖”、 “追”、“逼”，形成再次斗争现象。审查选民权利是一件极其严肃的工作，一定要强调实事求是，注意政策，不要随便扣“帽子”。对已被剥夺民主权利而又发现与事实有出入时，应当找本人谈话，反复对证，并允许其向选举委员会和人民法庭申诉，选举委员会和人民法庭应当慎重，既要防止“先入为主”，印象出发，也要防止放任自流，不加领导或者轻率决定。此外，在审查选民资格时，还必须注意与清理管制工作结合，通过公安部门重新加以审查，应管制而没管制的要宣布管制，管制错的立即纠正。
    第一阶段工作结束之后，工作组即转移他村，把人民法庭的干部留下继续工作。留给他们的任务是：搜集群众的意见和要求，受理申诉，商同选举委员会及时予以解决。同时结合酝酿代表候选人名单，协助村、镇干部作好总结工作报告，审查和修订生产计划，为下一阶段选举和召开人民代表大会作好准备。
      第二阶段
       （甲）进行选举。选举前党支部和选举委员会需要做好准备工作。主要是进一步搜集选民对代表候选人的意见，最后确定正式代表候选人名单，同时宣布选举时间、地点等。
    在选民小组讨论代表候选人名单时，应当特别对本选区的候选人进行充分讨论，以便选举时票数集中，同时还必须将选举中应注意的事项，如时间、地点、方法（几个候选人投几票或举几次手，只能少不能多）、纪律、携带选民证等，都一一交代清楚。选举委员会委员要有分工，分别负担各选区选举责任。
    在选举大会开始时，要郑重宣布选举纪律，指定专人登记参加选举人数，维持秩序，推举主席团，选民过半数时始可正式选举。主席团着重将选举方法、程序向群众交代清楚，并具体介绍本选区代表候选人的简历和优缺点（时间不宜过长），然后征求大家意见。如无意见，即进行选举。如有意见或有人临时另提候选人，而又有人附议时，主席团即应首先将新提候选人付表决，多数同意时，即应视新提候选人所代表阶层和原候选人中属于同一阶层的候选人同付表决（如新提候选人为一妇女，即应就原有候选人中之一妇女候选人同付表决，其他不是妇女的代表候选人，仍为正式代表候选人），最后确定一人为正式候选人，再进行选举，以便保证各阶层代表候选人的原定总数。特别是城镇如何保证各阶层代表候选人的当选，尤为必要。选举完了，即审查统计选票，当场公布并发代表证。选举办法一般采用举手选举。但为照顾选民特殊情况，如重病、孕妇等，也采取了交错选举办法，即发一部分选票，由监票员前去就选。
    （乙）召开人民代表大会。根据我们的经验，基层人民代表大会内容应是：认真总结政府工作，展开批评与自我批评，对干部评功评过，通过总结工作进行反官僚主义、反强迫命令、反违法乱纪的斗争，借以教育干部，但也应防止发生任何斗争干部的现象。
    其次是审查生产计划（多数村已经作过生产计划），审查计划执行情况。最好是结合生产合作社或好的生产互助组的典型发言，进行充分讨论，并作出必要的决定。
    第三是解决群众迫切要求解决的问题。如海伦县东丰村，村财政很紊乱，贪污现象严重，群众迫切要求整理村财政。代表会就作了决议，开始整理，群众反映很好。其他一般提案与要求，也要指定专人负责，协助代表审查处理，作到案案有着落，件件有交待。如提案过多，一时不能全部处理，要成立提案处理小组，会后协助政府负责处理。
    至于政府委员的产生，原则上是由人民代表选举，但为了充分发扬民主，采取了先由选举委员会提出候选人名单，经选民酝酿后再由人民代表大会选举的办法，这样更能体现民意，而又符合选举法精神。这种作法很受群众欢迎。
    最后是大会主席团应当形成领导核心（主席团选出之后，选举委员会即宣告结束），这是开好人民代表大会的关键。主席团要依靠代表，充分发扬民主，不能包办，但也必须善于抓住中心，掌握时间，解决问题。大会时间不宜过长，一般以一天为宜；城镇最多也不要超过两天。
       （丙）召开政府委员会结束普选。新的政府委员会应当讨论如何贯彻人民代表大会的决议，明确人民代表大会和政府委员会的职责。修正补充各种必要的制度。并确定村、镇人民代表大会每月召开一次，政府委员会每半月召开一次，临时有重大问题，可召开临时代表大会。政府委员会要定期向人民代表大会报告工作，尤其是财政收支情况，必须按月按季公布，并经人民代表大会审查批准。
    为了更好地集中力量搞好生产，克服“五多”现象，政府委员会还须结合整顿组织，主要是村镇以下的屯，街小组及群众性的组织。此外还要做好善后工作，总结普选，统计表报，汇总上报。
    几条主要经验
       （一）做好准备工作。首先是思想准备，特别是领导思想的准备很为必要。因为人民代表会议制度在黑龙江省已实行多年，不仅已有一定成绩，而且也已取得一些经验，这就很容易使一部分领导干部满足现状，产生消极情绪。特别是普选期间正值农忙季节，也很容易使一部分干部放松对这一工作的领导。因此，首先要求领导思想充分认识这次普选的重大意义和它的复杂性。只有领导思想有了充分的准备，而又在实际行动中加强领导，普选工作的顺利完成才有保证。其次是干部的准备。这次工作组的干部有的没有经过很好训练，以致在工作中发生很多问题。有的掌握不住政策，形成剥夺面过宽；有的不会走群众路线。特别在人口调查时，昌五镇发生的错误更多，机关企业没有同时填户口，以致浪费时间很大。再次是物质准备工作要作好。昌五镇的选民证不够用，在选民登记时没发选民证，后来补发，弄得很乱。
    （二）做好宣传动员工作。主要经验是：（甲）首先作好训练骨干的工作（包括村、镇、街、组干部等）。（乙）针对群众思想，结合群众切身利益、亲身体会，进行对比教育。这是最易深入人心，而为群众乐于接受的宣传方法。（丙）宣传形式要多种多样。会议时间不宜过长，一般以在晚间召开小型会为宜，同时还应注意地区分工。（丁）“做甚么宣传甚么”。就是紧跟着工作步骤进行宣传，这样收效较大。
       （三）有领导地发扬民主。首先要使群众明确认识什么叫做“民主”，什么叫做“民主集中制”，以避免极端民主化的倾向。如何贯彻有领导的发扬民主呢？（甲）有关普选的重大问题，都通过党支部、村（镇）原有基层组织和选举委员会向干部交代政策，免得因为不懂政策而发生紊乱现象。（乙）在有领导的前提下，大胆发扬民主，结合反官僚主义、反命令主义、反违法乱纪的斗争对干部进行评功评过。只有开展群众性的批评与自我批评，干部和群众的关系才能进一步密切，群众的政治积极性才能更加提高。经验证明：普选结合反官僚主义、反命令主义、反违法乱纪的斗争，不仅丰富了普选内容，而且大大地提高了人民代表大会和政府的威信，进一步密切了政府与人民的联系。（丙）认真负责地对待人民提案。这也是贯彻有领导的充分发扬民主的重要一面。根据海伦县诚实村等四个村一个镇的统计，人民提案达六百余件。对人民的提案必须予以重视，需要经调查了解后处理的，应向代表讲清；对一般意见和要求能够解决的立即解决；不能解决的也要说明原因，缓办的也要交代清楚。务使每一提案都有着落、有交代，以便进一步密切政府与群众的关系，使群众无限地信任自己的政府。
    （四）紧密结合生产，切实解决群众的迫切问题。首先在于照顾群众的生产时间，爱惜民力，凡一切有关普选的宣传、会议等活动，尽量利用群众生产间隙与夜晚时间。其次是从具体情况出发，找出生产中的主要环节与村镇的主要矛盾，特别是阻碍普选顺利进行的主要问题，加以解决。如海伦县诚实村解决了群众缺乏豆种的问题，白城县胜利村与太平那村组织群众打井抗旱；肇东县八村紧紧抓住生产行动，结合整顿支部改造政权；十三村处理了阻碍普选顺利进行的离婚错判案，这些都有力地支持了普选，推动了春耕。再次是普选与生产结合的领导问题。一般以采取干部分工包干办法较好，晚间在那组（生产互助组）进行宣传（包括了解情况），白天即跟着该组下地帮助生产。第四，主要村干部要进行分工，分别领导生产与普选，做到生产与普选两不误。
