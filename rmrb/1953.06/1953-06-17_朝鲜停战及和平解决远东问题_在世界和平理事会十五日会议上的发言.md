    Korean Armistice and Peaceful Resolution of the Far East Question
    ——Speech at the World Peace Council Meeting on the 15th
    Guō Mòruò
    The Vice-Chairman of the World Peace Council Standing Committee and Chairman of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, Guo Moruo, delivered a speech entitled "Korean Armistice and Peaceful Resolution of the Far East Question" at the World Peace Council meeting on the 15th. The full text is as follows:
    All existing international disputes can and should be resolved through peaceful negotiations and mutual consultation. This clear principle is now being supported by more and more people around the world. As pointed out in the communique of the Stockholm meeting of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council on May 6, 1953: "The clear truths promoted by the peace movement for several years, and the wise cause supported by the peace movement, have begun to bear fruit." The idea of peace is grasping the masses, and the power of people in various countries to strive for peace is growing stronger.
    This phenomenon is very natural, because maintaining international tension means further intensifying the arms race, continuing to increase military spending, and further impoverishing the lives of the broad masses of people. Conversely, any constructive measures and progress in resolving current international disputes will reduce the danger of war, help alleviate the severe economic crisis caused by the arms expansion movement in various countries, thereby alleviating the anxiety and unease that has been heavily weighing on the hearts of millions of people in recent years.
    It is precisely for this reason that hundreds of millions of people around the world warmly welcome the agreement reached by both sides of the Korean armistice negotiations on the issue of prisoner of war repatriation on June 8, and are eagerly hoping for the realization of the Korean armistice and the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. They unanimously believe that the Korean armistice issue is one of the most important, acute, and difficult international issues at present; if this issue can be resolved reasonably, it will help ease the current international tension, thereby preparing conditions for the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, the Far East issue, and many other outstanding international issues.
    As everyone knows, the achievement of the prisoner of war repatriation agreement, like the resumption of the Korean negotiations, is due to the unremitting efforts of China and North Korea. This agreement stipulates, on the one hand, that the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission shall have full authority, and the detaining side shall not hinder, interfere with, or sabotage it in any way; on the other hand, it stipulates that the side to which the prisoners of war belong shall explain and visit the prisoners of war. Therefore, it makes it possible for all prisoners of war to have the opportunity to exercise their right to be repatriated, which is in line with the principles stipulated in the Geneva Convention.
    From the main content of this agreement, people can more clearly understand that the so-called "no forced repatriation" argument consistently promoted by the US side in the past on the issue of prisoner of war repatriation is actually completely unfounded. Because prisoners of war are originally under the armed control of the detaining side, only the issue of the detaining side forcibly detaining prisoners of war exists, and there can be no question of "forced repatriation" at all. In particular, according to the agreement already reached by both sides, prisoners of war who are not directly repatriated after the armistice will continue to remain in South Korea and be taken care of and handled by the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission chaired by India and with the participation of Poland, Czechoslovakia, Sweden, and Switzerland. This makes the US side's so-called "forced repatriation" assumption lose all pretext.
    However, it must be pointed out that what should really be prevented on the issue of prisoner of war repatriation is the detaining side's forced detention of prisoners of war. People cannot but seriously note that the South Korean Syngman Rhee group is clamoring against the agreement on the repatriation of prisoners of war. Choi Duk-shin, the representative of the Syngman Rhee group participating in the armistice negotiations, openly opposed the provision that all prisoners of war who were not directly repatriated should be handed over to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission in a letter to US Chief Representative Lieutenant General Harrison on May 29, and threatened that "those prisoners who do not want to return to communist rule" will "rise up in revolt against those Indian troops." This is obviously the Syngman Rhee group's clamor to forcibly detain prisoners of war by force. Therefore, people must recognize that the key to the prisoner of war repatriation issue still lies in whether the US side can implement the provisions of the agreement and prevent the occurrence of forced detention of prisoners of war. This will be a new test that the US side will encounter in the process of implementing the agreement after the armistice takes effect. All those who desire a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue should continue to urge the US government to strictly fulfill its obligations to ensure that the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission can successfully complete its mission. After the prisoner of war issue is resolved and the Korean armistice is realized, the common task of people all over the world is to seek a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. In order to achieve the peaceful reunification of Korea, all foreign troops in Korea, including the Chinese People's Volunteers, must be withdrawn, and the Korean people must peacefully resolve their own problems. This is a major principle for truly resolving the Korean issue. This principle is not only in full compliance with the reunification aspirations and independent rights of the Korean people, but is also of great significance for ensuring peace and security in the Far East.
    However, people cannot but note that while the South Korean Syngman Rhee group is clamoring against the prisoner of war repatriation agreement, and while the Korean armistice agreement is yet to be signed and a higher-level political conference is yet to be convened, US President Eisenhower suddenly sent a letter to Syngman Rhee on June 8, claiming that after the conclusion of the Korean armistice agreement, the United States is prepared to negotiate and conclude a so-called "mutual defense treaty" with the Syngman Rhee group. People cannot but regard this statement by the US government as a conspiracy between the US government and the Syngman Rhee group for the political conference. It is quite obvious that the purpose of this conspiracy is either to openly deepen the division of Korea or to encourage the Syngman Rhee group to undermine the Korean armistice and peace. Therefore, this issue cannot but arouse the vigilance of the vast number of people around the world who hope to seek the peaceful reunification of Korea after the armistice.
    Speaking of this, people cannot but seriously note that many signs that have occurred so far cannot but arouse higher vigilance among the people of the Far East and international人士 who are defending the cause of peace. US Secretary of State Dulles, in his speech on April 18 this year, said without concealment that he wanted to "make our Eastern friends—from Japan, Korea, and Taiwan to Indochina and Malaya—face the same enemy, strive for the same purpose, and strengthen cooperation with each other." Recently, this Mr. Dulles' visit to the Near East and the Far East is an attempt to promote this "cooperation."
    The words and actions of Mr. Dulles and the warmongers in the US government prove that they are planning to further promote their policy of organizing a Far East aggressive alliance and creating division in Asia, and are planning to intensify their plan of "Asians fighting Asians."
    The words and actions of Mr. Dulles and the warmongers in the US government also prove that they are determined to continue to occupy China's territory of Taiwan and continue to collude with and assist the remnants of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang and be hostile to the Chinese people.
    There is no doubt that such a policy is extremely unpopular in the Far East and Asia, and it cannot but be opposed by the people of the Far East and Asia.
    The San Francisco unilateral peace treaty and other war treaties concluded between the US government and the Japanese Yoshida government have turned Japan into a US military base and colony, and want to revive Japanese militarism to threaten peace and security in the Far East. The suffering and humiliation felt by the Japanese people under the rule of the US occupation army and the Yoshida traitorous government are difficult to describe in words. Countless small and medium-sized enterprises engaged in peaceful production have been forced to close down. More than 10 million workers are suffering from unemployment. The actual wages of workers have fallen by 50% compared with the eve of the Korean War. More than 360,000 acres of land have been or are being requisitioned as barracks and airports. This has constantly aroused the heroic struggle of the Japanese people for independence, freedom, and democracy. Here, I would like to express my respect to the Japanese people who are standing at the forefront of the struggle. For the sake of the interests of the Japanese people and peace in the Far East, we believe that we must support the just struggle of the Japanese people, oppose using Japan as a base for military aggression and re-militarizing Japan, demand that all foreign troops withdraw from Japan, demand the conclusion of a genuine peace treaty between the countries concerned and Japan, and make Japan a peaceful, democratic, free, and independent country.
    The US government is attempting to interfere in the many military conflicts currently occurring in various parts of Southeast Asia due to the people's struggle for national independence, which is a threat to peace in Southeast Asia. We believe that only by resolving the existing military conflicts in these regions through peaceful consultation on the premise of respecting the independence of Asian nations and the right of the people of all countries to manage their own affairs can peace in Southeast Asia be promoted.
    The Burmese people's protest against the long-term invasion of Burma by the remnant armed forces of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang has been widely supported by the people of the world. We believe that the remnant troops of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang who have violated Burma's independent sovereignty and disrupted peace in Southeast Asia must be completely disarmed, and the foreign forces hiding behind these remnant bandit troops must stop their intervention activities. This will further guarantee peace in Southeast Asia.
    The US government touts so-called "technical assistance" in an attempt to get some Asian countries to provide military bases to the United States, follow the United States in implementing blockades and embargoes, and serve the US's diplomatic policy of dividing Asia. This seriously hinders the development of normal economic and cultural relations between Asian countries, while further infringing upon the independent sovereignty of these "assisted" countries and making the economic situation of these countries increasingly worse. Now these "assisted" countries have begun to express dissatisfaction, and the protests of the broad masses of people against the US intervention policy have become louder and louder. The open resistance of the Ceylon government and people to the US embargo policy is completely understandable.
    Therefore, in order to safeguard peace and security in the Far East and Asia, it is necessary to oppose interference in the internal affairs of other countries, respect the independent sovereignty of all countries, restore normal economic and cultural relations between countries, and develop trade between each other to create conditions conducive to improving people's living standards.
    Ladies and gentlemen, there are many major and complex issues that must be resolved in the Far East and Asia. It would be wrong and unrealistic to force others to accept the prerequisites for reaching an agreement, or to try to solve all these problems all at once. Only by resolving the outstanding issues one by one through consultation among major powers can the international situation be effectively and practically eased and the threat of war be eliminated step by step.
    The measures taken by the people of China and North Korea on the issue of the Korean armistice negotiations, and the joint efforts of the people of all countries in the world, are to promote the realization of the Korean armistice, thereby reducing the threat of a new war, easing the current international tension, and preparing conditions for convening a conference of major powers and peacefully resolving the Far East issue and other international issues.
    Ladies and gentlemen, please allow me to say it again: all remaining international disputes can and should be resolved through peaceful negotiations and mutual consultation. The Korean issue has already opened a path to peaceful resolution through patient consultation. The consultation among major powers that we have called for has been supported by the vast majority of people in the world. Countries with different social systems can coexist peacefully and can develop cooperation in trade, economy, and culture. We Chinese people have always believed in this truth. We warmly support the call for consultation among major powers. We hope to gradually resolve existing international disputes with all countries in the world through consultation, and sincerely hope that the people of all countries in the world will further urge their governments to adopt a spirit of consultation instead of resolving issues by force, and work together to make this a universal movement.
    The international situation can be eased, normal economic and cultural exchanges can be restored, and future human catastrophes can be avoided. The purpose of our consultation movement is to mobilize the peace forces of a wider range of people to make these beautiful hopes a reality as soon as possible.

    朝鲜停战及和平解决远东问题
    ——在世界和平理事会十五日会议上的发言
    郭沫若
    【新华社布达佩斯十六日电】世界和平理事会常务委员会副主席、中国人民保卫世界和平委员会主席郭沫若在世界和平理事会十五日会议上，作了题为“朝鲜停战及和平解决远东问题”的发言，全文如下：
    一切现存的国际争端，都是可以而且应该用和平谈判、相互协商的方式来求得解决的。这一明白的道理，现在已获得愈来愈多的世界人民的拥护了。正如一九五三年五月六日世界和平理事会常务委员会斯德哥尔摩会议公报中所指出：“和平运动几年以来所宣传的明白的真理，和和平运动所支持的明智的事业，业已开始出现成果。”和平的思想正在掌握着广大群众，各国人民争取和平的力量正在愈趋壮大。
    这种现象是很自然的，因为保持国际紧张局势，就意味着进一步加紧进行扩军备战，继续增加军事开支和使广大人民群众的生活更趋贫困；相反地，在解决当前国际争端方面的任何一个建设性的措施和进展，都会减少战争危机，有助于缓和各国因扩张军备运动而招致的严重的经济危机，从而减轻这几年来一直沉重地压在千百万人民心头上的焦虑和不安。
    正是因为这个缘故，所以全世界亿万人民都热烈欢迎六月八日朝鲜停战谈判双方关于战俘遣返问题的协议，并以极度关注的心情热望着朝鲜停战的实现和朝鲜问题的和平解决。他们一致认为：朝鲜停战问题是当前最重要、最尖锐、最困难的国际问题之一；如果这个问题能够得到合理的解决，那就有利于缓和目前的国际紧张局势，从而为和平解决朝鲜问题、远东问题以及其他许多悬而未决的国际问题准备条件。
    大家都知道，战俘遣返问题协议的达成，和朝鲜谈判的恢复一样，是出于朝中两国不懈的努力。这个协议一方面规定中立国遣返委员会应具有充分的权力，拘留方面不得给以任何阻难、干涉和破坏；另一方面又规定战俘所属一方应对战俘进行解释和访问。因此，它就有可能使全部战俘都有行使其被遣返权利的机会，这就符合了日内瓦公约所规定的原则。
    从这个协议的主要内容来看，人们可以更清楚地了解到，过去在战俘遣返问题上美国方面所一贯宣传的所谓“不得强迫遣返”的论调，在实际上是完全无中生有的。因为战俘本来是在拘留一方的武力控制之下的，所以在这里，只有拘留一方用武力扣留战俘的问题，而根本不可能有甚么“强迫遣返”的问题。尤其是根据现在双方已经达成的协议，在停战后未予直接遣返的战俘将继续留在南朝鲜，交由以印度为主席的、并有波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、瑞典、瑞士等国参加的中立国遣返委员会来看管和处理，这就更加使得美国方面所谓“强迫遣返”的假设丧失了一切借口。
    但是必须指出，在战俘遣返问题上真正应该防止的，倒是拘留一方对战俘的强迫扣留。人们不能不严重地注意到，南朝鲜李承晚集团正在叫嚷着反对关于遣返战俘问题的协议。李承晚集团参加停战谈判的代表崔德新在其五月二十九日发表的致美国方面首席代表哈利逊中将的一封信中，公然反对将全部不直接遣返的战俘交给中立国遣返委员会的规定，并威胁着说：“那些不愿回到共产主义统治下的俘虏”将“起来暴动对付那些印度军队”。这显然是南朝鲜李承晚集团要以武力强迫扣留战俘的叫嚣。因此，人们必须认清，战俘遣返问题的关键现在依然在于美方是否能够执行协议的规定，防止强迫扣留战俘的发生。这将是美方在停战生效后执行协议的过程中所要遇到的一个新的考验。一切渴望和平解决朝鲜问题的人们，应该继续督促美国政府严格履行其所承担的义务，以保证中立国遣返委员会能顺利地完成任务。在战俘问题解决和朝鲜停战实现之后，全世界各国人民的共同任务，就是求得朝鲜问题的和平解决。为了实现朝鲜的和平统一，必须撤退在朝鲜的一切外国军队，包括中国人民志愿军在内，必须由朝鲜人自己和平解决自己的问题。这是真正解决朝鲜问题的一个重大原则。这个原则不仅对于朝鲜人民来说，是完全符合于他们的统一愿望和独立权利的；而且对于确保远东和平与安全来说，也是具有重大意义的。
    但是人们不能不注意到：在南朝鲜李承晚集团正叫嚷着反对战俘遣返协议的时候，在朝鲜停战协定尚待签订、高一级的政治会议尚待召开的时候，美国艾森豪威尔总统忽于六月八日致函李承晚，声称在朝鲜停战协定缔结后，美国准备和李承晚集团谈判订立一项所谓“共同防御条约”。对于美国政府的这种声明，人们将不能不认为实际上就是美国政府和李承晚集团对于政治会议的一种预谋。十分显然，这种预谋的目的，不是要公开加深朝鲜的分裂状态，就是要鼓励李承晚集团来破坏朝鲜的停战与和平。因此，这个问题就不能不引起全世界希望停战后谋求朝鲜和平统一的广大人士的警惕。
    说到这里，人们还不能不严重地注意到：迄今为止所已经发生的许多征兆，不能不使远东各国人民以及正在保卫和平事业的国际人士提起更高的警惕。美国国务卿杜勒斯先生在今年四月十八日的演说中，就曾毫不掩饰地说，要“使我们的东方朋友——从日本、朝鲜和台湾到印度支那与马来亚——面对同一敌人，为了同一目的而努力，并加强彼此间的合作。”最近这位杜勒斯先生的访问近东和远东，就是企图推广这种“合作”。
    杜勒斯先生及美国政府中好战分子的言语和行动，证明了：他们正在打算更进一步地推行其组织远东侵略同盟、制造亚洲分裂的方针，正在打算变本加厉地进行其“亚洲人打亚洲人”的计划。
    杜勒斯先生及美国政府中好战分子的言语和行动也证明了：他们决心要继续侵占中国的领土台湾，并继续勾结和援助蒋介石残余匪帮而与中国人民为敌。
    毫无疑问，这样的方针在远东和亚洲是极其不得人心的，它不能不受到远东和亚洲人民的反对。
    美国政府与日本吉田政府缔结的旧金山片面和约及其他战争条约，使日本变成了美国的军事基地和殖民地，并要把日本的军国主义复活起来，以威胁远东的和平与安全，日本人民在美国占领军和吉田卖国政府的统治之下，其所感受的痛苦和屈辱是难以用言语来形容的。无数从事和平生产的中小企业被迫倒闭。一千万以上的劳动者遭受失业的痛苦，工人的实际工资较朝鲜战争前夜又降低了百分之五十。三十六万英亩以上的土地业已或正在被征用作为兵营和飞机场。这样就不断地激起了日本人民争取独立、自由、民主的英勇斗争。在这里，我愿向站在斗争前线的日本人民表示敬意。为了日本人民的利益和远东的和平，我们认为必须支持日本人民的正义斗争，反对以日本为军事侵略基地和使日本重新军国主义化，要求一切外国军队撤出日本，要求缔结有关各国与日本之间的真正和约，并使日本成为和平、民主、自由、独立的国家。
    对于目前东南亚各地人民因争取民族独立而发生的许多军事冲突，美国政府都企图加以干涉，这是对于东南亚和平的威胁。我们认为，只有在尊重亚洲各民族独立和各国人民有权自己管理自己事务的前提之下，采用和平协商的方式来解决这些地区的现有军事冲突，才能有利于东南亚的和平。
    缅甸人民对于蒋介石匪帮的残余武装在缅甸的长期侵略的抗议行动，业已得到了世界人民的广泛支持。我们认为，侵犯缅甸独立主权、扰乱东南亚和平的蒋介石匪帮的残余部队必须全部解除武装，而隐藏在这些残余匪军后面的外国势力必须停止其干涉活动。这样才能使东南亚的和平得到进一步的保证。
    美国政府标榜着所谓“技术援助”，企图使一些亚洲国家对美国提供军事基地、追随美国实行封锁禁运，为美国分裂亚洲的外交政策服务。这样，就严重地妨碍了亚洲各国间的正常经济文化关系的发展，同时更侵犯了这些受“援”国家的独立主权，并使这些国家的经济情况日益恶化。现在这些受“援”国家已经开始表示不满，而广大人民对于美国干涉政策的抗议已经越来越响亮。锡兰政府和人民对于美国禁运政策的公开反抗，是完全可以理解的。
    因此，为了维护远东和亚洲的和平与安全，就必须反对干涉各国内政，尊重各国的独立主权，恢复各国间正常的经济文化关系，并发展彼此间的贸易，以创造有利于改善人民生活水准的条件。
    各位女士，各位先生，远东和亚洲方面必须解决的重大问题是很多很复杂的。要强迫别人接受取得协议的先决条件，或企图一下子把所有这些问题都全部解决，都会是错误的和不切合实际的。只有通过大国协商的方式，对悬而未决的一些问题逐个地加以解决，才能有效而实际地逐步导致国际局势的和缓和战争威胁的解除。
    朝中两国人民在朝鲜停战谈判问题上所采取的措施，和世界各国人民的共同努力，就是为了要促成朝鲜停战的实现，从而减轻新战争的威胁，以和缓现在的国际紧张局势，来替召开大国会议及和平解决远东问题与其他国际问题准备条件。
    各位女士，各位先生，请允许我再说一遍吧：一切尚存的国际争端，都是可以而且应该用和平谈判、相互协商的方式来求得解决的。朝鲜问题已经由耐心协商开辟出了和平解决的门径。我们所号召的大国协商已经得到世界各国人民绝大多数的支持，不同社会制度的国家可以和平共处，可以发展贸易、经济和文化各方面的合作。我们中国人民是一直相信着这个真理的。我们热烈支持大国协商的号召，我们希望和世界各国用协商方式逐步解决现有的国际争端，同时并诚恳地希望世界各国人民更进一步促使各国政府采取协商精神代替武力解决，把这作为一个普遍性的运动而共同努力。
    国际局势是可以缓和的，正常的经济交流和文化交流是可以恢复的，未来的人类浩劫是可以避免的。我们的协商运动的努力就是要发动更广大的人民的和平力量，来使这些美好的希望及早成为现实。
