　　A Village Club in the Mountains
　　Zeng Yuqiu

　　In early summer, we visited Shansha Village in Fu'an County, northeastern Fujian. Outside the village, the wheat fields were a golden expanse, looking truly lovely from afar. A gentle breeze stirred through them, like rolling ocean waves. Some farmers had already started harvesting, painting a moving picture of a bountiful harvest!

　　Everyone I met, whether cadre or farmer, was beaming with joy. They were all boasting about the changes in their mountain village, boasting about the unprecedented harvest of the past decade, and boasting most of all about their club. So, the village cadre immediately took us to visit it.

　　On the cobblestone path leading to the club, a group of children were practicing the postures and movements of playing the waist drum. Although they had nothing on their waists, their hands were waving, their legs were moving, and their mouths were making "dong ba dong ba dong" sounds. As soon as they saw strangers, they scattered like birds, but soon their joyful and clear singing echoed from the other side of the wall. The bright sunshine illuminated the club's tall building, with Chairman Mao's portrait prominently displayed in the center of the wall, surrounded by pictures, banners, and musical instruments. The table was full of various popular readings and picture books. A young girl was leaning against the table, flipping through a Soviet magazine. She was wearing a simple blue outfit, and her thick black hair covered half of her face. Her drooping eyelashes didn't move, she was so absorbed in her reading that even our footsteps didn't draw her attention. It seemed she was completely immersed in the pictures of those rich fields, speeding tractors, and Soviet women in gorgeous clothes. Over there, some children were chattering and playing shuffleboard, bursts of happy laughter erupting from them. A boy was loudly instructing a little girl on how to hit the puck, but the little girl ignored him, confidently aiming at her target. With a "thwack" it went in, and she clapped her hands with joy. In a small square below the club, several young militiamen wearing blue cloth hats were clumsily playing basketball.

　　Seeing this scene, who would have thought that this was the ancestral hall that used to be deserted all year round! Seeing this scene, thinking about the difficult days spent in struggle in the past, who could not feel joy for these resilient people and bless them? Shansha Village was an old revolutionary base area in northeastern Fujian during the Second Revolutionary Civil War, and the center of the revolutionary storm in northeastern Fujian in 1933. Comrades Deng Zihui, Ye Fei, and others led peasant struggles here. Later, the Red Army went north. In those dark years, the Louxia Village, where reactionaries were entrenched, was only two miles away. The reactionaries often came out to carry out frenzied burning, killing, and looting. However, the peasants in this area, rich in revolutionary tradition, did not succumb. They hid in the stone caves behind the mountains and persisted in their struggle against the reactionaries. After liberation, the people of Shansha Village, who had endured many hardships, felt particularly relaxed. The Party and the People's Government helped them reorganize their dilapidated homes, and life became better. However, the remote mountain village was still remote. In the slack farming season, some young people really had nothing to do, and on rainy days, many people just slept with their heads covered. Without proper entertainment, without a place for everyone to gather, how boring it must be! Now, with the club, there are books, paintings, basketball, shuffleboard, northern waist drums, southern folk instruments, a loudspeaker and blackboard newspaper, as well as a phonograph and projector. Whenever it is the slack farming season or at dusk, the villagers come to the club and enjoy themselves, relieving the fatigue of a day's production and spending a meaningful time. Just as the farmer Nai Hong said: "Coming back from the fields, my feet are sore and my hands are weak, but after a trip here, I feel refreshed!" The elderly call the club "the place of peace and happiness." However, it would be wrong to regard this club merely as a place for farmers to entertain themselves and play. No, this club is also a school, spreading the various policies of the Party and the People's Government to the farmers, and educating the farmers about the socialist future. Farmers come here not only to relieve fatigue and enjoy themselves, but also to increase their knowledge and raise their awareness. Zhang Shangmeng, an old man with some education, always brings books borrowed from the club when he herds cattle. The new things in the books are so attractive to the farmers, children, young people and women in the mountain village that they often surround Zhang and listen to him read word by word. I contacted many young farmers, and they almost unanimously told me: "I like to read the heroic stories of the volunteers and books about the Soviet Union the most." Most of them know Huang Jiguang, and also know Qiu Shaoyun, and they prefer to talk about the Soviet Union, about collective farms and tractors. I asked them again: "What other books do you like to read?" A young man hesitated a little embarrassedly before saying: "Books about the Marriage Law." The young people next to him laughed happily, obviously agreeing with this representative answer. They told me that the club had also helped two happy events come to fruition. Shen Xiguang, a young farmer in the village, met Shen Chengmei, a young widow in Yangxi Village. The two became fond of each other and developed a deep and sincere affection. However, in this mountain village, people are not used to this kind of thing! They didn't dare to tell anyone, they just loved each other in their hearts. After the two watched the slideshow and pictures promoting the Marriage Law shown at the club, they made up their minds: "Marriage can be autonomous, this is the decision of the People's Government, we must make our own decisions about our affairs." Later, they also persuaded the elders in their families, and finally became a happy couple. On the day of their wedding, the cadres of the club specially brought a phonograph to celebrate. Now, this young couple work together and go to the club to play together, which is very enviable! Another is a young girl named Zhang Zimei, a quiet girl. Her father always believed that the marriage of his children was a matter for the parents. He often talked to the villagers about his daughter's marriage, and people casually asked: "Do you want a betrothal gift?" The old man jokingly said: "Why not? In the new society, not much is needed, an egg, a pound of sweet potato rice!" But the little girl didn't want her parents to worry about this matter. She had read books and watched slideshows at the club, and made up her mind: "I must never be a leaf floating with the water, whoever my dad tells me to marry, I will marry!" At the club, she met Ma Zhaokang, the young township head of Zhufeng Township. She liked his active work and youthful ability, and the two became fond of each other. She said: "You work hard, I am still young, and I want to study culture, when I am old enough, we'll talk." He said: "You have to study hard, I am waiting." The two spoke their hearts and got engaged. When the girl's father, Zhang, found out, he jokingly told the villagers: "Now it's over, the sweet potato rice is gone, and the eggs are gone too!"

　　The club's slideshows are deeply loved by the farmers, especially when slideshows of Soviet collective farm life are shown, the place is always packed. Those neat and beautiful houses in the countryside, those tractors that can plant a large area of land in the time it takes to smoke a cigarette, those collective farmers in brand-new and beautiful clothes, are all exciting the hearts of the people in the old revolutionary base areas. In the past, everyone had heard of socialism, but only abstractly knew what "upstairs and downstairs, electric lights and telephones" meant. What exactly socialism looks like was always vague. Once the slideshows were shown, their hearts were brightened. It turned out that their loved ones had shed blood and sweat for more than 20 years to create such a scene. Some of the old men said: "Socialism is good, I don't know if I will live to see that time?" Some said: "Being able to do this is not in vain for our struggle!" Young people are even more excited when they see it. They said: "If we can get to this point, we will use as much strength as we have!" Zhang Linzi, a youth league member, is a very active young man. He said to me: "If we can be like the Soviet Union in the future, I can do anything!" Indeed, once, in order to respond to the government's call to increase production, Zhang Linzi led the farmers to the mountains to cut grass and collect green manure. He slipped from the top of a tree and fell down. Everyone exclaimed in alarm, but unexpectedly he scrambled up from the deep grass, indifferently saying: "It's nothing, it's for socialism!" And waved his sickle to cut green fertilizer. People's ideology is changing, and bad habits are changing. After the land reform, township cadre Zhang Chengji developed the idea of "revolutionary success" and didn't even want to be the head of the mutual aid group. After watching the slideshows of the Soviet collective farms, he was enlightened, and with the education of the government, he became active in his work. Chen Naifeng, a young woman, didn't have the habit of working in the past. She put on shoes and socks and refused to go to the fields, thinking that "as long as men have money to spend, women don't have to worry about money." After seeing the scene of Soviet women still working hard, she also slowly changed. Now she can do everything from chopping firewood, carrying manure, and planting crops.

　　In many farmers' homes in the mountain village, Chairman Mao's inspiring inscription is posted: "Carry forward the revolutionary tradition and strive for greater glory." Now, under the leadership of the Party and the People's Government, and with the propaganda and education of the club, Chairman Mao's call is being transformed into practical actions for the masses to strive for a bumper harvest and support the country's great construction. This year's fertilizer accumulation campaign is being carried out with the help of loudspeakers and blackboard newspapers, changing the mountain village's habit of "only planting without fertilizing." In order to solve the difficulty of insufficient fertilizer, they are advocating the accumulation of more green manure. In the past, only one or two loads of fertilizer were applied per mu of land, but this year, 15 loads of fertilizer were applied per mu of land. As a result, wheat production generally increased by 35% compared to previous years. The unprecedented harvest of the past decade is the reward for the hard work of the mountain village farmers.

　　As I ended this pleasant visit, I sincerely congratulated them, congratulated the greater success of the mountain village club, and congratulated the mountain village people for living a happier life and striving for greater glory!

    山村的一个俱乐部
    曾毓秋
    初夏时节，我们访问了福建东北福安县的山下村。村外小麦一片金黄，龙头凤尾地真令人喜爱，微风荡来，像翻腾的海浪，有的农民已经开镰收割，好一幅动人的丰收景象啊！
    我碰到的不论是干部，不论是农民，都是那样欢天喜地的。他们都在夸耀自己山村的变化，夸耀这十年来未有的丰收，而夸耀得最多的还是他们的俱乐部。于是，村干部就立刻带我们去参观。
    在通往俱乐部的鹅卵石铺成的路上，一群孩子正在练习着打腰鼓的姿势和动作，虽然他们的腰间空无所有，可是手在挥舞，腿在移动，嘴里还在发出
    “咚吧咚吧咚”的声音。一看到陌生的人来，他们就像鸟儿一样轰地一下飞跑了，稍停，在墙的那边又响起了他们愉快嘹亮的歌声。灿烂的阳光把俱乐部高大的房子照得透亮，墙壁的正中央是毛主席的肖像，周围挂满了图片、锦旗和乐器，桌上满满地摆着各种通俗读物和各种画报画册，一个年青的姑娘正靠着桌子翻阅一本苏联画报，她穿着一套素净的青色衣裳，浓黑的头发遮住了她的半边脸蛋，垂下的睫毛一动也不动，她看得是那么入神，连我们的脚步都没有转移她的注意。看样子，她已完全沉醉在那些富饶的田野，奔驰的拖拉机和穿着华丽服装的苏联妇女的画面中了。那边，几个孩子正在叽叽喳喳地打康乐球，发出一阵阵愉快的笑声。一个男孩子吵嚷着指导一个小姑娘怎样打那个子儿，可是，小姑娘一点也不理会，很有信心地按着自己已经瞄准的角度打去，“叭”地一声打进去了，她独个儿高兴地拍起手来。俱乐部下面的一个小小的广场上，几个戴着蓝布帽子的青年民兵正在不熟练地打着篮球。
    看到这种情景，谁能想到，这就是过去一年四季荒落落地不见人影的祠堂呢！看到这种情景，想想过去那些在斗争中度过的苦难的日子，谁能不为这些倔强的人民感到快意而为之祝福呢？山下村是第二次国内革命战争时期闽东北的老革命根据地，是一九三三年闽东北革命风暴的中心，邓子恢、叶飞等同志都在这里领导过农民的斗争。以后红军北上了，在那黑暗的年月里，二里路以外就是反动派盘踞的楼下村，反动派经常出来疯狂地烧杀抢掠，可是，这一带富有革命传统的农民，并没有屈服，他们躲进了山后的石洞，坚持与反动派斗争。解放了，经受过重重苦难的山下村人民感到特别轻松，党和人民政府帮助他们重新整顿残破了的家园，生活变得好起来了。可是，偏僻的山村还是偏僻的，在农闲的季节，有些年青人的确闲得无事可干，在下雨的日子，好多人就闷着头睡觉。没有正当的娱乐，没有一个大家集会的场所，该是多么苦闷啊！现在，有了俱乐部，俱乐部里有书，有画，有篮球，有康乐球，有北方的腰鼓，有南方民间的乐器，有广播筒和黑板报，还有留声机和幻灯机，每逢农闲的时候或者黄昏时分，村民就走进了俱乐部，在那里尽情地玩起来，来消除一天生产的疲劳，来度过一段有意义的时光。正像农民奶红所说：“下田回来，本来脚也酸了，手也软了，来这里走上一趟，又满身轻松了！”老年人把俱乐部叫做“安乐所”。可是，要把这个俱乐部仅仅看做使农民娱乐和游玩的地方那就错了，不，这个俱乐部还是一座学校，它在给农民传播着党和人民政府的各项政策，它在给农民进行着社会主义前途的教育，农民到这里来不仅仅消除了疲困，快愉了身心，还增长了见识，提高了觉悟。张尚蒙老头有点文化，放牛的时候都要带上俱乐部借来的书，书里的新鲜事是那样吸引着山村的农民，小孩子，年青人和妇女们，常常把张老头围起来听他一字一句地念。我接触了很多青年农民，他们几乎是一致告诉我：“最喜欢看志愿军的英雄故事和讲苏联的书”。他们大多知道黄继光，也知道邱少云，他们更喜欢谈到苏联，谈到集体农庄和拖拉机。我又问他们：“你们还喜欢看什么书？”一个青年有点不好意思地犹豫了一下才说：“讲婚姻法的书。”旁边的青年都快活地哄笑起来，显然他们同意了这个有代表性的答复。他们告诉我，就在俱乐部里还成全了两桩喜事。村里有个青年农民沈西光，认识了洋西村一个青年寡妇沈成妹，两人要好起来，产生了浓厚而真挚的感情。但是，在这山村啊，人们还没见惯这种事哩！他们也不敢对人讲，只是心心相印而已。两人看了俱乐部放映的宣传婚姻法的幻灯片和图画以后，就拿定主意了：“婚姻能自主，这是人民政府的决定，我们的事情也要自己作主。”以后，他们又说服了家里的老人，终于成了一对美满的夫妻。结婚那天，俱乐部的干部还特地带了留声机去庆贺。现在，这对年青夫妇，一起劳动，一起到俱乐部去玩，好不叫人眼热啊！另一个是年青的姑娘张仔梅，她是个沉沉静静的姑娘。她的父亲一向认为儿女的婚姻就是父母的事，常和村里人谈到她的闺女要嫁，人们也随便发问：“要不要聘礼？”老头也就半开玩笑地说：“怎么不要？新社会，不多要，一个鸡蛋，一斤地瓜米！”可是小姑娘却没要父母担这份心事，她在俱乐部看过书，看过幻灯片，主意拿定了：
    “绝不能一片叶儿随水流，爹叫嫁谁就嫁谁！”在俱乐部里，她认识了主峰乡的青年乡长马照康，她看中他工作积极，年青能干，两人好起来了。她说：“你好好工作，我现在年龄还轻，还要学文化，等年龄够了，再说。”他说：“你要好好学习，我等着。”两人说出心里话，就订婚了。姑娘的爹爹张老头知道了，又给村里人半开玩笑地说：“现在完了，地瓜米去了，鸡蛋也去了！”
    俱乐部的幻灯是深深得到农民喜爱的，尤其放映苏联集体农庄生活的幻灯片时，人来得总是满满的。那些农村中整齐漂亮的房屋，那些一袋烟的工夫就能种完一大片土地的拖拉机，那些穿着崭新的美丽的衣服的集体农民，都在激动着老区人民的心。过去大家也听说过社会主义，但只抽象地知道什么“楼上楼下，电灯电话”，究竟社会主义是何等模样，总是若明若暗的。幻灯片一打，心里才亮了，原来二十多年自己的亲人流血流汗就是为了创造这样的光景。老头子们有的说：“社会主义就是好，咱不知道还活到那时活不到？”有的说：“能做到这个地步，也不枉咱们斗争了一场！”年青人看了更兴奋起来了，他们说：“要能到这个光景，有多少气力就能使上多少！”青年团员张林梓是个挺活跃的青年，他对我说：“要是咱们将来也能像苏联那样，不论什么事我也能干！”的确，一次，为了响应政府的增产号召，张林梓带领着农民上山去砍草积绿肥，他从树顶上一失脚掉了下来，大家都惊惶地“哎呀”一声，想不到他一骨碌从深草里爬起，满不在乎地说：“没啥，为了社会主义嘛！”又挥动着镰刀砍绿肥去了。人们的思想意识在变着，不好的习惯在变着。乡干部张成吉土地改革以后，产生了“革命成功”的思想，连互助组长都不想当了，看了苏联集体农庄的幻灯片，得到了启示，加上政府的教育，工作积极起来了；青年妇女陈乃凤，过去没有劳动习惯，穿起鞋袜，不肯下田，认为“只要男人有钱使，不怕女人没钱花。”看了苏联妇女还在努力劳动的情景，她也慢慢变了，现在砍柴、挑粪、种庄稼样样都能来了。
    山村的很多农民家里，都贴着毛主席激动人心的题字：“发扬革命传统，争取更大光荣”。现在，在党和人民政府的领导之下，在俱乐部的宣传教育之下，毛主席的号召正在变成群众争取丰收支援国家大建设的实际行动。今年的积肥运动正是在广播筒和黑板报的帮助之下展开的，一变山村“只管下种，不管施肥”的习惯，为了解决肥料不足的困难，就提倡多积绿肥，往年一亩地只上肥料一两担，今年一亩地就上了肥料十五担，结果麦子一般地都可比往年增产三成五。十年未有的丰收就是土地给山村农民辛勤劳动的报酬。
    当我结束了这场愉快的访问，我衷心祝贺，祝贺山村俱乐部的更大成功，祝贺山村人民生活得更加幸福，争取更大光荣！
