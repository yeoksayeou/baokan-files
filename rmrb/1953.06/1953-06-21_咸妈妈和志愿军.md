　　Mother Xian and the Volunteer Army
　　Sijin

　　I.
　　Feet treading the unyielding land of Korea,
　　Head covered in the clothing made by heroic Chinese sons and daughters,
　　Crossing mountains covered in white snow,
　　Breaking through ice to wash clothes.
　　The river water gurgles and flows,
　　Mother Xian washes clothes for the Volunteer Army;
　　Not afraid of the bone-chilling cold of the water,
　　Not minding the blood, sweat, and dirt.
　　For the wounded to recover quickly,
　　For the front lines to win victories,
　　Without feeling hardship or fatigue,
　　Busy by the river from morning till night.
　　The river water is clear to the bottom,
　　Clear water is perfect for washing clothes,
　　Washing day after day, month after month,
　　Washing out the deep friendship between China and Korea.

This is a poem sung by a wounded comrade recuperating in a medical clinic of a certain unit of the Volunteer Army, praising the Korean old woman, Xian Zaifu, who loves the Volunteer Army. The medical clinic is stationed in a mountain village near Shangganling in Korea, which is also the hometown of the old woman, Xian Zaifu.

Since the Volunteer Army was stationed here, this old woman Xian has never left, nor has she ever planned to leave. Regardless of the fact that there are rarely peaceful days here, regardless of the fact that the American devils are desperately attacking Shangganling, regardless of the enemy's planes howling overhead and the cannons exploding not far away, these all seem unimportant to old woman Xian. In her opinion, what is important is the presence of the Volunteer Army. As long as there is the Volunteer Army, there can be no enemies; as long as there is the Volunteer Army, there is hope for life; as long as there is the Volunteer Army, the hometown is as solid as a wall of bronze and iron! Whenever she sees the wounded Volunteer Army soldiers coming down from the front lines, her heart feels a sharp pain, both sad and full of respect. She thinks: These lovely children have come all the way here from thousands of miles away, braving bullets and sacrificing their lives, for whom? Isn't it for us? Now that their mothers are not by their sides and they are injured, how can I not take care of them?

So she comes and goes in the wind and rain, not afraid of planes bombing or shells exploding, day after day, month after month, washing and changing clothes for these lovely children, mending and patching, never complaining or saying she is tired. Whenever she delivers the clean and neatly mended clothes to the wounded and sick Volunteer Army soldiers, she always looks at the grateful, tearful eyes of those lovely children, and her face, which has been aged by the war, becomes particularly cheerful. So the wounded and sick Volunteer Army soldiers gradually stopped calling her old woman Xian, and affectionately called her "Mother of the Volunteer Army" or "Mother Xian."

　　II.
　　April 11th was a beautiful sunny day. After lunch, the wounded and sick soldiers leaped out of the air-raid shelter-like wards into the woods to breathe in the fresh air of spring. Some were reading newspapers and playing cards; others were singing and chatting. Just then, the sound of airplane engines came from afar. At this time, Mother Xian was heading back with a basket of washed clothes on her head. Hearing the sound of the plane coming from the southern sky, she quickened her pace. She looked up and saw that the wounded and sick comrades were still chatting in the woods, and she was so anxious that she shouted at the top of her voice: "Bianji wasimida! Hanggong! Hanggong!" As soon as everyone heard Mother Xian shouting "The plane is coming! Take cover..." they all ran into the air-raid shelter.

A buzzing engine sound approached. Just then, the sentry on the hilltop shouted loudly: "Comrades, be careful! 'Little Oil Jug'..." Before the sentry could finish his words, a dozen enemy planes had already dived down one after another, and forty or fifty bombs and gasoline bombs exploded in this area. Immediately, stones and dirt flew, and smoke enveloped the entire mountain. Mother Xian could see clearly: the houses at the foot of the mountain were bombed and collapsed, and several houses were ablaze. Suddenly, Mother Xian put the clothes basket on the ground and rushed like the wind to the few houses where the Volunteer Army supplies were stored. In the blink of an eye, she rushed into the thick smoke and fire. Several soldiers from the nursing squad also rushed in one after another to rescue the supplies piled inside. At this time, her own house also caught fire. When some comrades shouted: "Mother Xian, your house, quickly move things out!" and prepared to rush into her house, Mother Xian immediately stopped them and said seriously: "The public's things are important, hurry up and rescue them!" After speaking, she went back into the fire, put out this pile of fire, and then put out that pile of fire, carried out one pile of supplies, and then went to carry another pile of supplies.

The rescue was over. The wounded and sick comrades were extremely moved and ran to comfort Mother Xian. Only then did Mother Xian catch her breath, pull up the hem of her skirt, and wipe the sweat mixed with smoke and ash from her face. Just then, a soldier with a head injury suddenly threw himself into Mother Xian's arms. He sobbed and tears fell. This soldier's name was Zhang Zhushan, a member of the Youth League. Not long ago, he and his comrades attacked the enemy at night and annihilated a reinforced company of American troops. He was wounded in that battle and then came here to recuperate. In the long and arduous life in the trenches in the past, in the battles amidst smoke and fire, he had never shed a tear. But today, when he saw the Volunteer Army's supplies being rescued pile by pile, when Mother Xian's house was burned to rubble, when he saw Mother Xian's clothes burned, her hair singed, and her face blackened by smoke, when he saw Mother Xian pulling up the hem of her skirt to wipe her face with hands dripping with blood, he could no longer restrain his emotions. He cried bitterly, not just out of sadness, but also out of love, respect, and gratitude. It was an extremely complex and precious emotional surge. But Mother Xian did not cry. She just kept stroking Zhang Zhushan's face, as if a mother was comforting a wronged child. After a while, Zhang Zhushan stopped crying. He wiped the tears from his face and stood in front of Mother Xian, solemnly swearing as if he were standing in front of his commander before a battle: "The American bandits injured you, old lady, just like injuring my own mother. When I return to the front line, I will definitely avenge you and the Korean people!"

How stubborn Mother Xian has become through the tempering of the cruel war! She had never cried. Today, her home has been burned to ashes. She has no place to live, nothing to eat, and nothing to wear, but she did not shed tears. She knows that crying is useless. The enemy gives her only hatred, not tears. But this is only towards the enemy; towards her own people, towards those lovely children she speaks of, Mother Xian is like an extremely affectionate and loving mother. She has indeed shed tears, twice in total. Once, when she learned that the nurse of the medical clinic, Comrade Wang Yuben, had unfortunately sacrificed her life while rescuing the wounded, she cried, and she cried so sadly, with snot and tears. The second time was recently, when those lovely children who had injured their legs and arms helped her build a new house with logs and earth, when a lovely child named Lin Maotang proposed to name the new house "Sino-Korean Friendship Palace," and all the lovely children shouted "Approve, approve," when those lovely children sent her quilts, clothes, shoes, socks, rice, oil, and salt, she couldn't restrain herself, and tears of gratitude poured out. In the shimmering tears, Mother Xian said to everyone: "When I see the injured Volunteer Army soldiers being carried in, when I hear your painful moans, I feel so sad! I understand what this is for, and I also know what I should do. I always feel that if I can't do something for you lovely children, I will be letting down the motherland. You love the people of our country so much, we can never forget you. I feel that the friendship between the Chinese and Korean people is condensed with blood and flesh, and no enemy can break it. Mao Zedong and Kim Il-sung, our great leaders, will always lead us forward to victory!"

　　III.
　　A few days ago, the comrades planted new saplings in the place that had been bombed by enemy planes. They also wrote a poem to sing the praises of their will and ideals:

　　On that hillside permeated with smoke,
　　By that stream filled with bomb craters,
　　Volunteer Army soldiers plant small cedar seedlings,
　　One by one, row by row, diligently.
　　The Volunteer Army is the gardener of the garden of peace,
　　Bringing life and hope to Korea in the flames of war,
　　They plant seedlings and also sow friendship,
　　This friendship will grow together with the seedlings.
　　Let the seedlings grow into dense green shade,
　　Overlooking the growth of democratic Korea,
　　Let friendship be like flowers that never fade,
　　Living forever in the hearts of the Chinese and Korean people.
　　War merchants create disaster and death,
　　We are determined to build a paradise on earth,
　　As long as there is unity of peace-loving people,
　　The invaders' claws will surely be cut off and buried.

    咸妈妈和志愿军
    思进
    一
    脚踏着朝鲜不屈的土地，
    头顶着中华英雄儿女衣，
    翻过白雪覆盖的山，
    敲开冰层把衣裳洗。
    河里的流水哗啦啦地响，
    咸妈妈给志愿军洗衣裳；
    不怕那水冷刺骨痛，
    不嫌那血水汗水脏。
    为了伤员们早健康，
    为了前线上打胜仗，
    不觉苦来也不觉累，
    从早到晚河边忙。
    河里的流水清到底，
    水清正好把衣裳洗，
    天天洗来月月洗，
    洗出了中朝的深厚友谊。
    这是在志愿军某部医疗所里休养的一位伤员同志，歌颂热爱志愿军的朝鲜老大娘咸在福的一首诗。医疗所驻在朝鲜上甘岭附近的一个山村里，这里也就是咸在福老大娘的家乡。
    自从志愿军驻到这里，这位咸老大娘就从来没有离开过，她也从来没有打算要离开。不管这里很少有过平静的日子，不管美国鬼子拚着命向上甘岭进攻，不管敌人的飞机在头上嚎叫，大炮在不远的地方爆响，但对咸老大娘来说，这些都似乎并不重要。在她看来，重要的是有志愿军。只要有志愿军，就不能有敌人；只要有志愿军，就有了生活的希望；只要有志愿军，家乡就和打起了铜墙铁壁一样！每当她看到从火线上下来的志愿军伤员的时候，她的心就感到辣辣的，又是难过，又是崇敬。她就想：这些可爱的孩子，千山万水地来到我们这里，枪林弹雨，流血牺牲，为了谁？还不是为了我们。现在他们的妈妈都没有在他们身边，他们又受了伤，我能不照顾他们吗？
    于是她就风里来雨里去的，不怕飞机炸，也不怕炮弹轰，一天天地、一月月地在为这些可爱的孩子们洗洗换换，缝缝补补，从来不叫一声苦，不说一声累。每当她把洗得干干净净，补得整整齐齐的衣服送到志愿军伤病员们手里的时候，她总是望着那些感激得泪水盈眶的可爱的孩子们一双双的眼睛，她那被战争折磨得非常苍老了的脸上，就显得格外开朗起来。于是志愿军的伤病员们也就渐渐不称她咸老大娘，而亲切地叫她“志愿军的妈妈”或“咸妈妈”了。
    二
    四月十一日，是个大好的晴天。吃过了中饭，伤病员们都从防空洞式的病房里跃到树林里去，呼吸呼吸春天的新鲜空气。他们有的在看书报，打扑克；有的在唱歌，谈笑。就在这时候，远远传来了飞机马达的声音，这时候，咸妈妈正顶着一筐洗净的衣服往回走，她听到从南面天空中传来的飞机声音，就加快了步子。她猛一抬头，看到伤病员同志们还在树林里谈笑，急得她放大嗓子喊：“扁机瓦斯米达！航工！航工！”大家一听是咸妈妈在喊“飞机来了！防空……”一个个都钻到防空洞里去了。
    一阵嗡嗡的马达声迫近了。只听得山顶上哨兵高声喊：“同志们注意！‘小油挑’……”哨兵的话还没有说完，十几架敌机已经一架接一架地俯冲过来，四五十颗炸弹和汽油弹就在这一带爆炸开了，顿时，石块和泥土乱飞，烟雾笼罩了整个山。咸妈妈一旁看得清楚：山下的房屋被炸塌了，有几座房子燃起了熊熊的火焰。突然，咸妈妈把衣服筐子往地下一放，风也似地向堆着志愿军物资的那几间房子冲去，转眼她就冲到浓烟大火中了，看护班的几个战士也先后冲了进去，抢救起堆在里面的物资来。这时候，她自己的房子也起了火，当有的同志一边喊着：“咸妈妈，你的房子，快搬东西！”一边准备冲到她房子里去的时候，咸妈妈立刻拦阻着严肃地说：“公家的东西要紧，快去抢救！”说完，她又钻进大火中去了，扑灭了这一堆火，又扑灭那一堆火，抱出了一堆物资，又去抱另一堆物资。
    抢救结束了。伤病员同志们都感动极了，跑来慰问咸妈妈。咸妈妈这才喘定了气，扯起裙边，擦了一下脸上混合着烟硝灰尘的汗水。就在这时候，一个头部负伤的战士猛地扑在咸妈妈的怀里，只听得他哇一声，眼泪唰唰地掉了下来。这个战士名叫张祝山，是个青年团员，不久以前，他和他的战友们夜袭敌人，消灭了美军一个加强连，在那次战斗中他负了伤，以后就来到这里休养了。过去他在漫长的艰苦的坑道生活中，在烟里来火里去的战斗中，他从没有掉过一滴泪，而今天，当他看见志愿军的物资被一堆堆地抢救出来，咸妈妈的房子被烧成瓦砾时，当他看见咸妈妈的衣服被烧烂了，头发被烧焦了，脸被烟火熏黑了时，当他看见咸妈妈扯起裙边擦脸的双手在滴着鲜血时，他再也抑制不住自己的感情了，他痛哭起来，这不完全是难过，还有爱戴、尊敬、感激，这是一种极复杂也是极可贵的感情的激动。可是咸妈妈却没有哭，她只是用手不停地抚摸着张祝山的脸，好像母亲在安慰一个受了委屈的孩子一样。过了一会，张祝山不哭了，他擦了擦脸上的泪水，站在咸妈妈的面前，好像战斗以前站在首长面前一样庄严地宣誓：“美国强盗炸伤了你老人家，就和炸伤了我的母亲一样，我回到前线，一定要替你和朝鲜人民报仇！”
    在残酷的战争的锻炼中，咸妈妈变得多么倔强啊！她从来没有哭过，今天，她的家被烧成了一把灰，她没有了住的，没有了吃的，也没有了穿的，她也没有流泪，她知道流泪是没有用处的。敌人给她的只有仇恨，没有眼泪。不过这只是对敌人；对自己的人，对她说的那些可爱的孩子，咸妈妈却像一个极富感情的慈爱的母亲。她的确流过泪，一共是两次，一次是当她知道了医疗所的护士王玉本同志为了抢救伤员而不幸牺牲了的时候，她哭了，哭得真是伤心，一把鼻涕一把泪的。第二次就是最近，当那些伤了腿，伤了臂膀的可爱的孩子们一根木头一堆土地帮她把新房子盖好的时候，当一个名叫林茂堂的可爱的孩子提议把这座新房子命名“中朝友谊宫”所有的可爱孩子高喊“赞成，赞成”的时候，当那些可爱的孩子们给她送来了被子、衣服、鞋袜、大米、油盐的时候，她抑制不住了，感激的热泪扑簌簌地流了出来。在闪闪泪光中，咸妈妈对大家说：“我一看到抬来了受伤的志愿军，我一听到你们痛苦的呻吟，我心里真难过！我了解你们这是为了什么，我也知道我应该做些什么，我老是觉得要是不能为你们这些可爱的孩子做点什么事，我就对不起祖国。你们那样爱我们这个国家的人民，我们永远也不能忘记你们，我觉得中国人民和朝鲜人民的友谊是用血肉凝结成的，是任何敌人也打不破的。毛泽东和金日成，我们的伟大的领袖，他们永远领导着我们向胜利前进！”
    三
    前些日子，同志们在被敌机轰炸过的那块地方栽上了新的树苗，他们又做了一首诗来歌颂他们的意志和理想：
    在那硝烟弥漫过的山坡上，
    在那弹坑布满了的溪流旁，
    志愿军战士把小小的杉树苗，
    一棵棵一行行辛勤地栽上。
    志愿军是和平花园的园丁，
    给战火中的朝鲜带来生命和希望，
    他们栽上了幼苗也就种下了友情，
    这友情将和幼苗一起生长。
    让幼苗长成浓密的绿荫，
    俯瞰着民主朝鲜的成长，
    让友情像开不败的花朵，
    永远活在中朝人民的心上。
    战争贩子制造着灾难和死亡，
    我们决心在人间造起天堂，
    只要有爱好和平人民的团结，
    侵略者的魔爪一定被砍断和埋葬。（附图片）
    咸妈妈风也似地向堆着志愿军物资的那几间房子冲去……
