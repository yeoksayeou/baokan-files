They are successfully working to victoriously complete the first five-year plan, which is a contribution to the prosperity and strength of their motherland and the strengthening of world peace.

Today, as peace-loving youth around the world, united with the people of all countries, actively prepare for the Third World Youth Congress and the Fourth World Youth and Student Festival for Peace and Friendship, the victory of your Congress will strengthen the unity of Chinese youth, thereby ensuring greater unity and cooperation among youth worldwide and strengthening our common struggle for peace and friendship among the people of all countries.

To the Dear Delegates of the Second National Congress of the New Democratic Youth League of China:

We, all the Youth League members and youth of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, warmly celebrate the opening of the Second National Congress of the New Democratic Youth League of China.

Over the past four years, the League members and youth in our Chinese People's Liberation Army, like the youth of the whole country, have grown rapidly under the kind care and leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party. The training and education of the Party and the Youth League organizations have continuously improved our political awareness, military skills, and cultural level, and we have played an active role in completing various tasks of the army. We are proud to live in the great era of Mao Zedong; every brilliant achievement of the motherland makes us rejoice, and the strength shown by the National Youth League on all fronts such as the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, various social reforms, and economic recovery over the past four years makes us feel infinitely honored.

The Second National Congress of the New Democratic Youth League of China is being held at a time when our country is beginning to enter a period of planned construction. We believe that this Congress will encourage all League members and the vast number of young people to actively participate in the country's construction cause, and work together with the people of the whole country to gradually realize the country's industrialization and gradually transition to socialism. All the Youth League members and youth of our People's Liberation Army are welcoming the convening of the Congress with their own practical actions, and we earnestly look forward to the tasks given to us by the Congress; we will definitely resolutely implement the resolutions of the Congress, strive to learn advanced Soviet military science and technology, tirelessly improve our military, political and cultural levels, stand vigilantly on the forefront of national defense, and contribute all our strength to building a regularized and modernized national defense army, safeguarding the security and peaceful construction of the motherland, and safeguarding peace in the East and the world!

We wish the Congress a successful victory!

And to all the Delegate Comrades:

All League members and youth of the Chinese People's Volunteers, with incomparable excitement, warmly congratulate the victorious opening of the Second National Congress of the New Democratic Youth League of China, and wish the Congress a complete success.

Standing on the forefront of defending the motherland and safeguarding peace in the Far East and the world, all the League members and youth of the Chinese People's Volunteers, together with the entire army, under the leadership of the Party, resolutely struck at the invaders, and in completing combat, training, fortification, logistics and transportation and various other tasks, in all different services, have demonstrated a high degree of revolutionary heroism, displayed the noble qualities of patriotism and internationalism of Chinese youth, and even emerged heroes and model figures like Huang Jiguang, Luo Shengjiao, and Zhang Jihui, Lu Min, Huang Jiafu, Wang Defu, Lin Bingyuan, Cai Jintong, Yi Caixue, Zhou Lasheng, and Han Decai. The Youth League in the Volunteer Army has become the Party's most capable assistant and reliable reserve force.

Today, as our great motherland has transitioned from a period of economic recovery to a new historical period of large-scale construction, the New Democratic Youth League of China is holding its Second National Congress. This is of great significance for leading all League members and uniting and educating the vast number of young people across the country to actively respond to the call of the Party and Chairman Mao, and work together with the people of the whole country to strive to complete the historical task of gradually transitioning from New Democracy to Socialism. We, all the League members and youth of the Volunteer Army, are determined to redouble our efforts to improve our thinking of patriotism and internationalism, learn advanced Soviet military science, quickly master modern military technology, strengthen our organization and discipline, and in the struggle to defend our beloved great motherland and safeguard peace in the Far East and the world, even more highly promote revolutionary heroism to welcome the Second National Congress of the Youth League; and we are determined to implement the instructions of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party to the Youth League and the resolutions of the Second National Congress of the Youth League with the greatest enthusiasm, loyalty and determination. Under the banner of the great and glorious Chairman Mao, let us bravely advance and strive for greater victories in the cause of defending and building the motherland!

Congratulatory Telegram from the Republican Youth Federation of France

Dear Comrades of the New Democratic Youth League of China:

With the greatest pleasure, through our delegation, we extend to you our warmest respects and congratulate you on the complete success in the task of uniting Chinese youth to fight for the construction of socialism!

We have been detained for eight months at the behest of the French rulers, who are pursuing the imperialists' anti-peace and anti-national independence conspiracies. However, in prison we are encouraged by the example of millions of patriots in all countries struggling for the survival and freedom of the people.

We understand that, as our beloved and tragically deceased Comrade Stalin said, our work is not as difficult as that encountered by the Russian Communists. Therefore, when we see with our own eyes that the powerful Soviet Union has completed great undertakings, it gives us unlimited confidence in the future of the great struggle we are engaged in.

The heroic battles of the Chinese People's Volunteers in Korea and the important contributions made by Chinese youth under the leadership of the great Chinese Communist Party in the struggle for a just and lasting peace, are worthy of the heroes of the Long March and worthy of your leader, the outstanding Chairman of the People's Republic of China, Comrade Mao Zedong.

Comrades, please believe that in every struggle of yours, the French youth, educated in the spirit of proletarian internationalism by the French Communist Party—the party of Maurice Thorez—stand with you.

In August, the youth of our two countries and the youth of the world will meet at the Fourth World Youth and Student Festival for Peace and Friendship, organized by the World Federation of Democratic Youth and the International Union of Students. Together we will draw new strength from this gathering.

Long live the Chinese people and youth led by Comrade Mao Zedong!

Long live the World Federation of Democratic Youth, with the Soviet Lenin Communist Youth League, personally nurtured by Lenin and Stalin, standing at the forefront!

Long live the unbreakable friendship between the youth of China and France!

       法兰西共和青年联盟的贺电亲爱的中国新民主主义青年团的同志们：
    我们以极其愉快的心情，通过我们的代表团，向你们致以最亲切的敬意，并祝贺你们在团结中国青年为建设社会主义而奋斗的任务中获得圆满的成功！
    由于奉行帝国主义者反和平与反民族独立的阴谋的法国统治者的指使，我们已被拘禁了八个月之久。然而我们在监狱中却为各国千百万为争取人民的生存和自由而斗争的爱国者的榜样所鼓舞。
    我们懂得正如我们敬爱的、不幸逝世的斯大林同志所说过的话一样，我们的工作并没有俄国共产党人遇到过的那样困难。所以当我们亲眼看到强大的苏联已经完成了巨大的事业时，使我们对于自己所进行的伟大的斗争的前途具有无限的信心。
    中国人民志愿军在朝鲜的英勇战斗，中国青年在伟大的中国共产党的领导下在争取正义的持久和平的斗争中所作的重要贡献，无愧于长征的英雄们，无愧于你们的领袖、中华人民共和国的卓越主席毛泽东同志。
    同志们，请你们相信：在你们的每一斗争中，法国共产党——莫里斯·多列士的党——以无产阶级国际主义精神教养下的法国青年，都是和你们站在一起的。
    八月里，我们两国青年和全世界青年将在世界民主青联、国际学联所主办的第四届世界青年与学生和平友谊联欢节上会面，我们将一起从这个聚会中吸取新的力量。
    毛泽东同志所领导的中国人民和青年万岁！
    以苏联列宁、斯大林亲自培育成的苏联列宁共产主义青年团站在最前列的世界民主青年联盟万岁！
    中法两国青年牢不可破的友谊万岁！
