Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, June 13th: The Korean-Chinese delegation to the Korean Armistice Negotiations issued the following communiqué on June 13th:

The meetings of the staff officers of both sides continued on June 13th as administrative meetings and are scheduled to continue on June 14th at 11:00 AM.

Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, June 13th: Our special correspondent Wu Min reports: After the adjournment of the plenary session, the two groups of staff officers held meetings simultaneously at Panmunjom for the third consecutive day. The plenary session will not reconvene until the staff officers' meetings yield results.

With the signing of the agreement on the repatriation of prisoners of war having removed the last obstacle to the signing of the armistice agreement, the staff officers' meetings are still being held in secret. Of the 63 draft articles of the armistice agreement, agreement has been reached during the course of the armistice negotiations, but these articles still need to be finalized before the agreement is signed. The changes to the military demarcation line drawn by the staff officers in November 1951 must be delineated and revised to reflect the current front line, which has generally shifted south.

One group of staff officers has been meeting for five days to draft the remaining administrative details prior to the signing of the armistice agreement. This meeting adjourned on the 13th after two hours in a large tent beside the Panmunjom highway and will resume on the morning of the 14th, while the other group of staff officers, with maps, continued to meet in the meeting tent on the afternoon of the 13th.

The series of rapid meetings held by the staff officers with maps indicates that progress has been made in revising the military demarcation line. The staff officers worked on the maps until 12:18 PM on the 13th, then adjourned until 2:00 PM when they resumed the meeting. The work of revising the demarcation line on the map continued until 4:35 PM. The staff officers also worked on the map on the morning of the 12th at 11:00 AM and adjourned after 14 minutes. They resumed work at 2:00 PM and adjourned again after 12 minutes. They reconvened at 5:00 PM and adjourned at 5:57 PM. Both groups of staff officers will continue to meet separately at 11:00 AM on the 14th.

    朝鲜谈判双方参谋人员会议昨天继续举行
    【新华社开城十三日电】朝鲜停战谈判朝中代表团六月十三日发表公报如下：
    六月十三日两个双方参谋人员会议继续举行行政性会议，并定于六月十四日十一时继续开会。
    【新华社开城十三日电】本社特派记者吴敏报道：全体会议休会以后，两组参谋人员接连第三天在板门店同时举行会议，在参谋人员的会议没有得到结果以前，全体会议不致复会。
    由于战俘遣返问题的协议的签字而解除了签订停战协定的最后阻碍以后，参谋人员的会议仍在秘密举行。关于停战协定的六十三条草案，在停战谈判进行的过程中已经获得协议，但在协定就要签订以前，这些条款仍有待于最后确定。参谋人员在一九五一年十一月划定的军事分界线上的改变，必须加以划出和修正，以适应在整个说来已经南移的目前的战线。
    有一组参谋人员的会议已经进行了五天，以拟定停战协定签订以前的其余的行政细节问题。这个会议十三日在板门店公路旁边的大帐篷里举行了两小时以后休会，要到十四日上午再开会，而另一组带着地图的参谋人员，十三日下午继续在会议帐篷内开会。
    带着地图的参谋人员所举行的一连串迅速的会议，显示修改军事分界线的工作已经有了进展。参谋人员十三日上午在地图上一直工作到十二时十八分，以后休会到下午二时又开会。在地图上修改分界线的工作继续进行到下午四时三十五分。参谋人员十二日上午十一时也在地图上工作，在十四分钟以后休会。下午二时他们又恢复工作，经过十二分钟以后又休会。他们在下午五时复会，到五时五十七分休会。这两组参谋人员在十四日上午十一时将继续分别开会。
