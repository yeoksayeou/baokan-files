Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, June 20th: Political figures in New Delhi are greatly concerned about Syngman Rhee's "release" of North Korean prisoners of war. It is generally believed that this incident is very serious.

　　On the 19th, major newspapers in Delhi published this news on the front page. The "Hindustan Standard" headline was "Rhee Ruins Korean Armistice Prospects". The "Statesman" headline was "Rhee Deals a Blow to Armistice".

　　The "Times of India" on June 19th, in an editorial entitled "What Next?", asked: "Is the peace of Asia and the world to be endangered by allowing this fanatic to run amok in Korea?" The paper pointed out that Syngman Rhee had openly opposed the armistice since there was hope for peace, "yet the reaction he aroused in high circles in Washington was so mild that, apart from a few lightly sketched admonitions, they took no action to restrain him." The editorial continued: "Right under the eyes of the Allied forces stationed in Korea, he released tens of thousands of North Korean prisoners of war in order to shamelessly and deliberately undermine the armistice. If he escapes punishment this time, who knows where this completely irresponsible, eccentric, and selfish little man will create trouble next time."

    印度各报对李承晚强迫扣留战俘极为不满
    【新华社新德里二十日电】新德里政界人士对于李承晚“释放”北朝鲜战俘一事感到极大的焦虑，一般人认为这个事件是十分严重的。
    十九日德里各大报都在第一版刊载了这个消息。“印度斯坦旗报”的标题是“李破坏了朝鲜的停战前途”。“政治家报”的标题是“李打击了停战”。
    六月十九日的“印度时报”在题为“下一着将是什么”的社论中问道：“亚洲和世界的和平是否将因纵容这个偏执狂者在朝鲜胡作非为而受到危险？”该报指出，李承晚从和平有实现的希望时起就公开反对停战，“然而他在华盛顿高级人士方面所引起的反应是如此温和，除了几句轻描淡写的忠告之外，他们没有采取任何行动来约束他”。社论又说：“就在驻扎在朝鲜的联军的眼前，他为了无耻地和有意地破坏停战，释放了成千上万的北朝鲜战俘。如果他这次逃脱了惩罚，不知道这个完全不负责任的乖戾的自私小人，下一次又将在那里制造乱子。”
