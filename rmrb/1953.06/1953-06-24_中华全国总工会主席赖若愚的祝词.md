Dear Representative Comrades:

    On behalf of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, I extend warm congratulations to the Second National Congress of the China New Democratic Youth League.

    In the past four years, under the kind care, teaching, and leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong and the Chinese Communist Party, the China New Democratic Youth League has carried out tremendous work among the broad masses of young people and achieved brilliant successes. The broad masses of young people have demonstrated their vigorous spirit and created countless heroic deeds and emerged as many model figures on all fronts of defending and building the motherland. The heroic posture of Chinese youth on all fronts shows that the China New Democratic Youth League has become the core of uniting the broad masses of young people, and has become a powerful assistant and a strong reserve force for the Chinese Communist Party in uniting and educating the younger generation.

    In industrial and mining enterprises, the Youth League and trade union organizations, under the leadership of the Party, have closely cooperated to restore and develop production, and to improve the lives of workers on the basis of developing production, and have made consistent efforts to protect the special interests of young male and female workers. In industrial and mining enterprises and on all production fronts, Youth League members are often an active and powerful force in labor competitions. They lead the broad masses of workers to bravely and enthusiastically participate in the struggle to increase production, improve quality, reduce costs, and increase labor productivity, and have created excellent results. Youth League members are often the most active elements in various activities of the trade union.

    Now, our motherland has begun to enter a new historical period of planned national economic construction. Both the Youth League and trade union organizations are facing the same great and glorious historical task—to realize national industrialization and gradually transition to a socialist society. The glorious China New Democratic Youth League will surely be able to carry forward the glorious tradition of Chinese youth under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, stand at the forefront of the broad masses, and unite the broad masses with its own exemplary actions to bravely undertake the new and glorious historical task.

    With the development of the national economic construction, the ranks of the working class will expand day by day. And the vast majority of the newly added workers will be young people from urban and rural areas. The work of educating new workers, mainly the work of educating young workers, will simultaneously increase the responsibilities of trade union and Youth League organizations. Our primary common task in this regard is to help young workers quickly master technology. We have a responsibility to educate veteran workers to cherish new workers as they cherish their own children, and to patiently help new workers learn technology. At the same time, young workers should also respect their masters, respect the teachings and guidance of technical workers, and conscientiously learn technology.

    We should pay special attention to strengthening the education of young workers in safe operations. When they first enter the factory, everything is new and unfamiliar to them. These new and unfamiliar things may be dangerous to them. In order to prevent accidents, they must be educated in safe operations. At the same time, trade unions and Youth League organizations should also be concerned about the lives of young people who have just left their families and entered factories and mines, and help them solve various problems in their lives.

    Education on labor discipline must also be carried out among young workers, so that the broad masses of young people understand the unity of national interests and individual interests, so as to strengthen the organization and discipline of young workers. And educate them to bravely struggle against all bad phenomena that undermine labor discipline and harm national interests.

    Comrades, our task is arduous, but we are fully confident that as long as we unite more closely around the Chinese Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong, study hard, and work hard, we will surely be able to victoriously realize the historical task of the national construction period.

    I wish the Second National Congress of the China New Democratic Youth League a victorious completion of its historical mission! (Xinhua News Agency)

### 中华全国总工会主席赖若愚的祝词

    中华全国总工会主席赖若愚的祝词亲爱的代表同志们：
    我代表中华全国总工会向中国新民主主义青年团第二次全国代表大会敬致热烈的祝贺。
    四年来，中国新民主主义青年团在毛泽东同志和中国共产党的亲切关怀、教诲与领导之下，对广大青年群众进行了巨大的工作，获得了光辉的成就。广大青年群众在保卫祖国和建设祖国的各个战线上，都显示了他们的蓬勃的朝气，创造了无数英雄事迹，涌现了许多模范人物。中国青年在各个战线上的英雄姿态，说明中国新民主主义青年团，已经成为团结广大青年的核心，已经成为中国共产党团结与教育青年一代的有力的助手和坚强的后备队伍。
    在工矿企业中，青年团和工会组织，共同在党的领导之下紧密地配合在一起，为了恢复与发展生产，为了在发展生产的基础上改善工人的生活，进行了一致的努力，从而也保护了青年男女工人的特殊利益。在工矿企业和一切生产战线上，青年团员们经常是劳动竞赛中的一支活跃的、强大的力量，他们带动着广大的工人群众，勇敢而热情地参加了增加产量、提高质量、减低成本和提高劳动生产率的斗争，并创造了优越的成绩。青年团员在工会的各种活动中经常是最积极的分子。
    现在，我们祖国已开始进入国民经济有计划建设的新的历史时期，青年团和工会组织，都面临着同一个伟大而光荣的历史任务——实现国家工业化并逐步过渡到社会主义社会。光荣的中国新民主主义青年团，一定能够在中国共产党的领导下，发扬中国青年的光荣传统，站在广大群众的前列，并以自己的模范行动团结广大群众勇敢地担当起新的光荣的历史任务来。
    随着国家经济建设事业的发展，工人阶级的队伍将日益扩大。而增加的新工人中，将有极大部分是城市和农村的青年。教育新工人的工作，主要地将是教育青年工人的工作，这就同时增加了工会和青年团组织的责任。我们在这方面的首要的共同任务，就是帮助青年工人迅速掌握技术。我们有责任教育老工人，使他们爱护新工人，像爱护自己的子弟一样；使他们耐心地帮助新工人学习技术。同时，青年工人也应尊敬师傅、尊敬技术工人的教授和指导，用心地学习技术。
    我们应该特别注意加强对青年工人的安全操作的教育。他们刚入工厂，一切事物都是新奇而生疏的，这些新奇和生疏的事物对他们是可能发生危险的，为了防止事故，就必须对他们进行安全操作的教育。同时，工会和青年团组织还应当时刻关怀刚刚离开家庭走入厂矿的青年人的生活，帮助他们解决生活中的各种问题。
    对于青年工人还必须进行劳动纪律的教育，使广大青年了解国家利益与个人利益的一致性，以加强青年工人的组织性和纪律性。并教育他们向一切败坏劳动纪律、危害国家利益的不良现象勇敢地进行斗争。
    同志们，我们的任务是艰巨的，但是，我们完全相信，只要我们更紧密地团结在中国共产党和毛泽东同志的周围，努力学习、努力工作，就一定能胜利地实现国家建设时期的历史任务。
    敬祝中国新民主主义青年团第二次全国代表大会胜利地完成它的历史使命！（新华社）
