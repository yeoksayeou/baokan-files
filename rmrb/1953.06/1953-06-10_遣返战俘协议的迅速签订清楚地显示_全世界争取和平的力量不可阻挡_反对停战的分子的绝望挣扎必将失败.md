    Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 9th – Special correspondent Wu Min reports: After both sides signed an agreement on issues prior to the Korean armistice, the delegation held an administrative meeting at 11:00 this morning. Following the plenary session, staff officers met to discuss the final administrative details before the signing of the armistice agreement.
    Before the agreement on the issue of prisoners of war was signed yesterday, representatives, staff officers, and translators from both sides had met as many as nine times.
    This frequent activity shows that the armistice negotiations, after continuing for twenty-three months, will soon come to a successful conclusion, despite the attempts by those in the United States and South Korea who advocate "going it alone" to obstruct the upcoming armistice.
    It is now clear that the signing of the agreement on the issue of prisoners of war is the final, decisive turning point in the negotiations toward the Korean armistice and cessation of hostilities desired by all peace-loving people in the world. This agreement is a decisive victory in the two-year-long resolute struggle of the people of the world to end the Korean War and ease tensions in the Far East.
    The content of the administrative meeting remains confidential. However, comparing the proposals made by both sides shortly before the administrative meeting and the agreement on the "Terms of Reference for the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission" on the issue of prisoners of war, it can be seen that the armistice was already in sight when the Korean-Chinese side put forward a proposal to resolve the issue of prisoners of war in two steps, thereby paving the way for the resumption of negotiations.
    The eight-point proposal put forward by the Korean-Chinese representatives on May 7th was the key to a swift Korean armistice. World public opinion recognized this fact, so they unanimously and resolutely demanded that this eight-point proposal be used as the basis for reaching an agreement on the issue of prisoners of war.
    The nature of the administrative details still to be resolved after the signing of the agreement on the issue of prisoners of war has not yet been revealed, as the delegations and staff officers from both sides are still holding secret meetings. However, it is clear that once the full text of the armistice agreement is finalized and the demarcation line across Korea is determined, the date for signing the armistice agreement can be agreed upon.
    In November 1951, when the second item on the agenda had been agreed upon, the military demarcation line had already been drawn on the map, and the armies of both sides were to withdraw from this demarcation line to form a demilitarized zone. It was then agreed that this line would be valid if the armistice agreement was signed within thirty days. In order to eliminate the US excuse that the demarcation of the military demarcation line would constitute a "de facto ceasefire," it was stipulated at that time that the demarcation line would be revised according to changes on the battlefront at the time of the signing of the armistice agreement. Since then, the battle line has slowly moved south. However, revising the demarcation line to fit the current line of contact between the two sides will not take too long, based on past experience in demarcating the line.
    The swift signing of the agreement on the repatriation of prisoners of war clearly shows that the world's forces for peace have grown so strong that they can no longer be ignored, and it also marks the failure of those in the United States and South Korea who advocate "going it alone" in attempting to continue and expand the war. The desperate struggle of those who oppose the armistice to obstruct the armistice is doomed to fail.

### 遣返战俘协议的迅速签订清楚地显示  全世界争取和平的力量不可阻挡  反对停战的分子的绝望挣扎必将失败

    遣返战俘协议的迅速签订清楚地显示
    全世界争取和平的力量不可阻挡
    反对停战的分子的绝望挣扎必将失败
    【新华社开城九日电】本社特派记者吴敏报道：在双方就朝鲜停战前夕的问题签订协议以后，代表团在今天上午十一时举行行政性会议。全体会议以后，参谋军官开会，以商定签订停战协定以前的最后行政细节。
    昨天在签订关于战俘问题的协议前不久，双方代表、参谋军官和翻译人员曾经开会九次之多。
    这种活动频繁的情况，说明停战谈判在延续二十三个月以后终将很快地获得顺利的结束，虽然美国的和南朝鲜的那些主张“单独干”的人企图阻挠即将到来的停战。
    现在可以清楚看出，关于战俘问题的协议的签订，是谈判走向全世界一切爱好和平的人们所要求的朝鲜停战和停止敌对行为的最后的、决定性的转折点。这个协议是两年来世界人民为结束朝鲜战争与缓和远东紧张形势而进行的坚决斗争中的决定性胜利。
    行政性会议的内容仍然保持秘密。但是，把举行行政性会议以前不久双方提出的建议和关于战俘问题的“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”的协议比较
    一下，就可以看出，在朝中方面提出分两个步骤来解决战俘问题的建议、从而为恢复谈判铺平道路时，停战就已在望了。
    朝中代表在五月七日提出的八点建议，是迅速达成朝鲜停战的关键，世界舆论认识到这个事实，所以他们一致坚决地要求以这个八点建议作为达成关于战俘问题协议的基础。
    签订关于战俘问题的协议以后，尚待解决的行政细节的性质还没有透露，因为双方代表团和参谋军官还在举行秘密会议。但是，可以清楚看出，一旦停战协定全文定稿、横贯朝鲜的分界线确定后，就可以商定签订停战协定的日期。
    在一九五一年十一月，当议程第二项已达致协议时，在地图上已经划定了军事分界线，双方军队均将撤离这条分界线以形成一个非军事区。当时同意，如果停战协定在三十天之内签订，这条线即属有效。为了消除美国藉口说划定军事分界线将构成一种“事实上的停火”，当时规定分界线将按照在签订停战协定时战线上的变化加以修订。自从那时起，战线已慢慢南移。但是，修定分界线以适合当前双方接触的战线，根据过去划定分界线的经验，将不会需时太久。
    遣返战俘的协议的迅速签订清楚地显示，全世界争取和平的力量增长得如此强大以至它不能再被忽视，并且这也标志着美国的和南朝鲜的那些主张“单独干下去”的一伙人企图继续和扩大战争遭到了失败。反对停战分子阻挠停战的绝望挣扎是注定要失败的。
