Why Have Construction Operation Plans

By our reporter Chen Ji

When the site directors of the Beijing Iron and Steel Industry Institute construction site, under the direct administration of the Ministry of Heavy Industry Construction Engineering Company, recalled the chaotic situations in past construction, they often said, "At that time, we didn't know how much we had to complete each day, how much labor we needed, or how much material we would use." Why did this phenomenon of blind construction occur? Because in the past, there was no construction operation plan, only an annual plan and a quarterly plan. These annual and quarterly plans could not guide construction. Within the annual and quarterly plans, it was impossible to specifically stipulate the amount of work to be done each month, each ten-day period, and each day, and the amount of labor required. It was impossible to separately stipulate the progress and labor for each sub-item project. Of course, it was also impossible to stipulate the work to be done by each construction site, each construction team, and each individual. In the past, making such general plans was also very perfunctory. Technician Fei Yi told me: When he made the plan last year, he divided the annual plan by four to get the quarterly plan; then, based on the quarterly plan, he unrealistically drew up a project schedule. He spent only two hours making this plan and hurriedly handed in the paper. He said, "At that time, the higher authorities wanted a plan, so we had to make a plan to cope with the task." Once this plan was made, it was locked in a drawer, and no one intended to use it. Because the site directors, construction teams, and group leaders, having taken this plan, could not carry out construction according to it.

The construction operation plan is not like this. It is formulated based on the annual plan, quarterly plan, construction budget, and construction organization design. In the construction operation plan, a monthly operation plan for the construction site must be made realistically. In the monthly operation plan, the quantity of sub-item projects and unit projects and the labor required to complete this quantity must be specified. The quantity of projects and labor for each floor and each section must be specified. The materials, equipment, tools, prefabricated parts, etc., required every ten days must be specified. The work to be done each day and the labor required must be specified. The types and grades of workers needed must be specified. Based on this monthly operation plan, the construction team makes the construction team leader's operation plan; the construction team leader and the worker group leader make the team operation plan. With this kind of operation plan, cadres and workers can accurately know how much work to do each month, each ten-day period, and each day, how much labor is needed, and how much material and tools are needed. Cadres and workers, having taken this operation plan, can carry out construction according to it. This can avoid blindness in construction and overcome chaotic phenomena in construction.

Because the operation plan stipulates the responsibilities of the construction site and each unit, and stipulates the responsibilities of the site director, technical personnel, construction workers, material handlers, group leaders, and workers, everyone has a responsibility, knowing the work they should do each day and the goals to strive for. The concrete workers of the Second Construction Site of the Beijing Iron and Steel Industry Institute construction site, having seen the operation plan, once said, "From now on, we can know how much work we do each day, how much money we earn, how much time we spend, and what to do if we fail to complete the task on time." They describe the operation plan as "four knows." This "four knows" summarizes the benefits of the operation plan. Workers who know the work to be done each day will try their best to complete the work. In the initial implementation of the operation plan, the concrete workers of the Second Construction Site of the Beijing Iron and Steel Industry Institute construction site knew that they had to complete the foundation project of a building in five days. But on the first day, they did not complete the quota and could not complete it in five days. They were anxious and immediately improved the labor organization and did complete it in five days. This fact shows that the implementation of the operation plan can guarantee the timely completion of the national plan. Similarly, the site director, having an operation plan, can use it to understand the progress of the project each day and the labor required each day, so as to grasp the entire project and ensure its timely completion. The material department can also guarantee the supply of materials on time according to the operation plan, avoiding the phenomenon of work stoppage due to lack of materials.

One of the main reasons why many capital construction units failed to complete the national plan on time last year was the lack of operation plans. Many projects of the Construction Engineering Company directly under the Ministry of Heavy Industry were delayed last year. Site director Xu Deyi told me that he delayed the foundation project of the Mechanical Museum of the Academy of Sciences in Shenyang by forty days before it was completed. Site director Zhuang Yicheng also told me that he delayed the construction of buildings at the Nanta construction site in Shenyang by a month. They said that at that time, because there was no operation plan, it was not known whether the task could be completed. Xu Deyi said, "All day long, I was in a daze at the construction site, not knowing how much work I had done. When work stopped and labor was wasted, I didn't even know what was going on. It wasn't until after a project was completed that I knew how much time it had taken and how much labor had been used." At that time, the site director relied on the morning meeting every day to understand the situation and allocate tasks. When he heard that the concrete foundation project was completed, he knew that he had to lay bricks on the foundation and then went to find bricklayers. He was lucky if he found bricklayers; if he couldn't find bricklayers, he had to stop work. When he heard that there was no wood, he went to the material department in a hurry to ask for wood. The material department had no wood in reserve, so he had to stop work and wait for materials. The workers said, "In the past, without a plan, we didn't know what to do tomorrow after finishing our work today. As soon as it dawned, we went to work and waited for the construction worker to assign tasks. Sometimes, the construction worker didn't know what task to give, so we had to sit on the ground and wait, which made us really uncomfortable!" In this case, it is unimaginable to complete the task on time.

With an operation plan, not only can the national plan be completed on time, but also construction can be carried out in a balanced manner. So-called balanced construction means completing the plan monthly, every ten days, and daily. If there are negative factors that disrupt this balance, they can also be detected in advance in the operation plan and prevented in time. In the initial stage of implementing the operation plan, the Second Construction Site of the Beijing Iron and Steel Industry Institute construction site found that the concrete project could not be completed on time, which hindered the progress of the entire project. Therefore, it requested the dispatching office to transfer a batch of concrete workers from other construction sites to support the Second Construction Site to ensure that the concrete project could be completed on time. Recently, the Second Construction Site found that the bricklayers' bricklaying speed was too slow, which hindered the progress of the project. Therefore, it was decided to promote advanced bricklaying methods among the bricklayers, improve the labor organization, and increase the bricklaying speed in order to catch up with the progress. This can ensure that every link of the construction unit can complete the task on time according to the operation plan and ensure balanced construction. The result of balanced construction is to avoid rush work in construction.

Without an operation plan, it is impossible to carry out construction in a balanced manner, and it is impossible to avoid rush work in construction. The lessons of many construction units have already illustrated this point. Last year, the Construction Engineering Company directly under the Ministry of Heavy Industry completed only 27.27% of the annual project task in the five months from March to July; but in the three months from August to October, it had to complete 61.49% of the annual project task. That is to say, in three months, it was necessary to rush to complete more than twice the task completed in five months. Why did such an imbalance occur? Site director Zhuang Yicheng said, "Because there was no operation plan, we didn't know the completion of the task, but we blindly thought: It's still early! There are still five or six months to carry out construction! Don't worry about not being able to complete the task! Therefore, the completion of the task in the previous months is usually very bad." When winter was approaching and it seemed that the task could not be completed, but it had to be completed, the method of rush work was adopted, and efforts were made to complete it. Site director Chen Hong once said to me, "When rushing to complete the task, we forgot everything and stayed up for several days, rushing under the dazzling lights! If we could catch up with the progress, it would be a good thing, and we didn't care about the quality. To be honest, even if we caught up with the progress, it would be illegal and undisciplined." How is it illegal and undisciplined? Because in order to rush the progress, workers would inevitably work overtime, violating the Trade Union Law; they would inevitably ignore the quality, violating the operating procedures, and abandoning the quality standards. When the Construction Engineering Company directly under the Ministry of Heavy Industry rushed to complete the task in September and October last year, many workers and cadres were exhausted. The workers said, "At that time, we had to line up early in the morning to see a doctor; we couldn't get our turn until noon. Because there were too many people seeing a doctor." At that time, the quality of the projects rushed out was very bad. The iron tiles of some buildings were blown away by the wind. Many of the plastered whitewashes were cracked. Are these facts not enough to illustrate the serious consequences of rushing to complete construction?

The benefits of construction operation plans are also reflected in their ability to organically organize various departments and various types of work, making them a whole, and carrying out work in a coordinated manner. Because in the operation plan, not only the tasks of the construction unit are determined, but also the tasks of the supply unit and the affiliated factory are determined; not only the work to be done by the bricklayers every day is stipulated, but also the work to be done by the carpenters, concrete workers, steel workers, plumbers, and electricians is stipulated; not only their own tasks are stipulated, but also the relationship between them is stipulated. In this way, the operation plan organizes all units and individuals within the plan and carries out construction in a coordinated manner according to the plan. The labor organization department can adjust the labor force at any time according to the operation plan, avoiding the phenomenon of work stoppage or waiting for people. The material supply department can prepare the materials needed on site in time according to the operation plan, preventing the occurrence of work stoppage due to lack of materials. The affiliated factory can also make prefabricated parts such as doors, windows, and concrete floors according to the operation plan to ensure the needs of the site. Carpenters, bricklayers, concrete workers, steel workers, plasterers, plumbers, and electricians can also carry out construction in a coordinated manner according to the operation plan. This can avoid the phenomenon of mutual disconnection and mutual disconnection in construction.

When there is no operation plan, the various departments and various types of work cannot closely cooperate and connect with each other. When the construction unit starts work, the material department cannot supply the materials, so work has to be stopped. Because the construction unit has no operation plan, it does not know when some materials are needed, how many materials are used every day, and how many materials are still lacking; when it is found that there is a shortage of certain materials on site, it reaches out to the material department to ask for them; the material department does not have this material, so work has to be stopped and waiting for materials. Due to the lack of a plan, it is not known the situation of material use on site. Sometimes, many materials are stockpiled in one construction site, and work is stopped due to lack of these materials on the other hand. In the absence of mutual connection, conflicts often occur between various types of work. The bricklayers build the brick walls, and the plumbers say: "Why didn't you bricklayers leave a place for us? How can we install plumbing pipes?" So the plumbers dug many holes in the brick walls they had built in order to install the pipes. Plumbers and electricians do not contact each other and do their own thing, sometimes even installing plumbing pipes and electrical pipes together. Various types of work also drag each other down under the guidance of no plan. The concrete workers work too slowly, so the bricklayers have to wait until the concrete workers complete the concrete project before they can go up to lay bricks. This chaotic phenomenon of mutual incoordination exists in varying degrees in various construction units. This phenomenon hinders the progress of the project and affects the quality of the project. In order to eliminate this phenomenon, it is necessary to formulate an operation plan, organize various units within the plan, and carry out construction rhythmically like gears.

Of course, in order to enable the construction operation plan to achieve the above-mentioned results, in addition to ensuring that the operation plan is formulated realistically, it is also necessary to establish a sound dispatching organization and designate a special person to be responsible for supervising the implementation of the construction plan; otherwise, the implementation of the operation plan is not guaranteed.

    为什么要有施工作业计划
    本报记者  陈迹
    当重工业部直属建设工程公司北京钢铁工业学院工区的工地主任们，回忆起过去施工中混乱的情况时，常常说道：“那时候，我们每天要完成多少任务，要用多少人工，要费多少材料，我们心中是没有数的。”这种盲目施工的现象，为什么会发生呢？因为在过去没有一个施工作业计划，只有一个年度计划和季度计划。这些年度计划和季度计划，是不能指导施工的。在年度计划和季度计划内，不可能具体地规定每月、每旬、每日所要做的工程数量和所需要的劳动力，不可能分别地规定分项工程的进度和劳动力，当然也不可能规定每个工地、每个施工组和每一个人所要做的工作。过去做这样笼统的计划，也是很敷衍塞责的。技术员费奕告诉我：他在去年做计划时，把年度计划用四来除，得出季度计划；然后根据季度计划，不切实际地画出了工程进度表。他仅仅花了两个小时，就做出了这种计划，匆匆忙忙交了卷。他说：“那时候，上级要做计划，所以我们不得不做个计划来应付差事。”这种计划，做好了，就锁在抽屉内，谁也不准备去用它。因为工地主任、施工组和小组长拿了这种计划，也不能根据它来进行施工。
    施工作业计划就不是这样了。它是根据年度计划、季度计划、施工预算、施工组织设计来制订的。在施工作业计划内，要切合实际地做出工地的月份作业计划。在月份作业计划里，要规定分项工程、单位工程的数量和完成这个数量所需要的劳动力，要规定每层、每段的工程数量和劳动力，要规定每旬所需要的材料、设备、工具、预制品等，要规定每天所要做的工作和所需要的人工，要规定需要那些工种和那些等级的工人。施工组根据这个月份作业计划，做出施工组长的作业计划；施工组长要和工人组长做出班组作业计划。有了这种作业计划，干部和工人就能确切地知道每月、每旬、每日要做多少工作，需要多少人工，需要多少材料和工具。干部和工人拿了这种作业计划，就可以根据它，来进行施工。这样就可以避免施工中的盲目性，克服施工中的混乱现象。
    由于作业计划规定了工地和各个单位的职责、规定了工地主任、技术人员、施工员、材料员、小组长和工人的责任，因此每一个人就有了责任，知道他每天所应该做的工作，所要奋斗的目标。北京钢铁工业学院工区第二工地混凝土工人们，看到了作业计划，曾经说道：“今后我们每天可以知道干多少活；赚多少钱；花多少时间；到了时间完不成任务，应该怎么办。”他们形容作业计划为“四知道”。这个“四知道”概括了作业计划的好处。工人们知道了每天所要做的工作，就会想尽办法，来完成这个工作。在初步执行作业计划时，北京钢铁工业学院工区第二工地混凝土工人，知道要在五天内做好一栋楼房的基础工程。但在第一天，他们没完成定额，不能在五天内做好，他们着急了，马上改善劳动组织，果然在五天内做好了。这个事实，说明作业计划的实行，可以保证国家计划的按期完成。同样的，工地主任有了作业计划，可以根据它来了解每天工程的进度，每天所需要的劳动力，从而可以掌握整个工程，使其按期完成。材料部门也可以根据作业计划，按时保证材料的供应，避免停工待料的现象。
    去年许多基本建设单位没有按期完成国家计划的一个主要原因，就是没有作业计划。重工业部直属建设工程公司去年的许多工程都拖延了工期。工地主任许德义告诉我，他去年在沈阳修建科学院机械专馆的基础工程，拖延了四十天，才完工。工地主任庄以诚也告诉我，他去年在沈阳南塔工地修筑楼房，延误工期一个月。他们说，那时候，因为没有作业计划，能否完成任务是不知道的。许德义说：“一天到晚，在工地里，昏昏沉沉，不知道干了多少活。停了工，窝了工，还不知道怎么一回事，等到做完一个工程，才知道花了多少时间，用了多少人工。”那时候，工地主任靠着每天早晨的碰头会议，来了解情况，来分配任务。当他听说混凝土基础工程完工了，他才知道要在基础上砌砖，才去找瓦工；找到了瓦工，还算幸运；找不到瓦工，只好停工。当他听说没有木料了，才去找材料部门，急着要木料。材料部门没有储备的木料，也只好停工待料。工人们说：“过去没有计划，我们今天干完了活，不知道明天干什么。天一亮，上了班，就等着施工员来分配任务。有时候，施工员也不知道给什么任务，我们只好坐在地上，等待着，等得我们真难受呵！”在这种情况下，要按期完成任务，是不可想像的。
    有了作业计划，不但能按期完成国家计划，而且能均衡地进行施工。所谓均衡地施工，也就是按月、按旬、按日完成计划。如果有了消极的因素，来破坏这种均衡，那么在作业计划里也能够预先发现出来，及时地加以防止。北京钢铁工业学院工区第二工地在执行作业计划的初期，发现混凝土工程不能按期完成，妨碍整个工程的进度，因此请求调度室，从别的工地调来一批混凝土工人，支援第二工地，保证混凝土工程能够按期完成。最近第二工地又发现瓦工砌砖的速度太慢，妨碍工程的进度，因此决定在瓦工中推广先进砌砖法，改善劳动组织，提高砌砖的速度，以便赶上进度。这样就可以保证施工单位的每个环节，能够按照作业计划，按期完成任务，保证均衡地施工。均衡地施工的结果，就避免了施工中的突击现象。
    在没有作业计划的情况下，就不可能均衡地进行施工，也就不可能避免施工中的突击现象。许多施工单位的教训，已经说明了这一点。去年重工业部直属建设工程公司在三月至七月的五个月时间内，仅仅完成全年工程任务的百分之二十七点二七；但在八月至十月的三个月时间内，却要完成全年工程任务的百分之六十一点四九。这就是说，在三个月内，要突击完成比在五个月内所完成的还要多出两倍多的任务。为什么发生这样不平衡的现象呢？工地主任庄以诚说：“因为没有作业计划，不知道完成任务的情况，但还盲目地以为：早得很哩！还有五六个月的时间可以施工呢！不怕完不成任务！因此在前几个月完成任务的情况，照例是很糟糕的。”等到冬季快要来临的时候，眼看任务完不成，但又不能不完成，于是就采用突击的方法，拚命地来完成。工地主任陈鸿曾经对我说：“在突击任务的时候，我们什么事都忘记了，几天不睡觉，在耀眼的灯光下，抢呀！赶呀！能抢上了进度，就算好事，那里还顾得上什么质量好坏呢？老实说，即使抢上了进度，也是违法乱纪的。”怎么是违法乱纪呢？因为要抢进度，势必就要工人加班加点，违反工会法；势必就要忽视质量，违反操作规程，放弃质量标准。重工业部直属建设工程公司在去年九、十月突击任务的时候，不少工人和干部都累垮了。工人们说道：“那时候，我们一清早，就要排队，去看病；排到中午，还轮不到自己。因为看病的人太多了。”那时候，突击出来的工程的质量，都是很坏的。有的楼房盖铁瓦被风刮走了。许多抹好的白灰，都裂开了。这些事实，还不足以说明突击施工的严重恶果吗？
    施工作业计划的好处，还表现在它能够把各个部门、各个工种有机地组织起来，使它们成为一个整体，互相联系地进行工作。因为在作业计划中，不但确定了施工单位的任务，而且确定了供应单位、附属工厂的任务；不但规定了瓦工每天所要做的工作，而且规定了木工、混凝土工、钢筋工、水暖工、电气工所要做的工作；不但规定了他们自己的任务，而且规定了他们相互间的关系。这样作业计划就把所有的单位和个人，组织在计划内，按照计划，协调地进行施工。劳动组织部门可以根据作业计划，来随时调剂劳动力，避免窝工或停工待人的现象。材料供应部门可以根据作业计划，来及时准备现场所需要的材料，妨止停工待料的情况的发生。附属工厂也可以按照作业计划，做出门、窗、混凝土地板等预制品，保证现场的需要。木工、瓦工、混凝土工、钢筋工、抹灰工、水暖工、电气工也可以照着作业计划，协调地施工。这样就可以避免在施工中互不联系互相脱节的现象。
    在没有作业计划的时候，各部门、各工种之间就不能密切地互相配合、互相联系。施工单位开了工，材料部门供应不上材料，就只好停工。因为施工单位没有作业计划，不知道什么时候需要一些什么材料，不知道每天用了多少材料，还缺多少材料；等到发现现场缺少某种材料时，才伸手向材料部门要；材料部门没有这种材料，只好停工待料。由于没有计划，不知道现场使用材料的情况，有时候，在一个工地里，一面积压许多材料，一面因为没有这些材料而停工。在互不联系的情况下，各工种之间也常常发生互相冲突的事情。瓦工砌好了砖墙，水暖工说：“你们瓦工怎么不给我们留下位置？我们怎样安装水暖管道呀？”于是水暖工为了安装管道，又把砌好的砖墙挖了好多洞。水暖工和电气工互不联系，各干各的，有时甚至把水暖管和电气管安在一块儿了。各个工种在没有计划的指导下，也互相拉后腿。混凝土工工作太慢了，瓦工就只好等着，等到混凝土工做好混凝土工程，才能往上去砌砖。这种互不协调的混乱现象，在各个施工单位都或多或少地存在着。这种现象，妨碍工程进度，影响工程质量。为要消除这种现象，就必须制订作业计划，把各个单位组织在计划里，像齿轮一样地有节奏地进行施工。
    当然，要使施工作业计划能够收到上述效果，除了必须把作业计划制订得切合实际外，还要建立健全的调度机构，指定专人负责监督施工计划的执行，否则，作业计划的实现就没有保证。
