Xinhua News Agency, Paris, June 3rd (TASS dispatch): In France, the movement to support the resolutions of the Vienna World People's Peace Congress is gaining increasing momentum.

According to "l'Humanité," municipal councils in many French towns, including those in Seine-et-Oise, Charente, and Pyrénées-Orientales, advocate convening a conference of the five major powers to peacefully resolve international disputes, to cease the Korean War and the Indochina War, and oppose the National Assembly's ratification of the Bonn and Paris war treaties. The Cher department council, on the recommendation of Communist council members, passed a resolution calling for major powers to conclude a peace pact. Representatives of all parties and Communists voted in favor of this proposal.

The National Executive Bureau of the French Farmers' Committee for the Defense of Peace and Agriculture held a meeting in Paris. A resolution was adopted at the meeting to launch a movement among French farmers to strive for the cessation of the Korean War and the Indochina War, to strive for the peaceful resolution of all international disputes, to oppose the National Assembly's ratification of the Bonn and Paris war treaties, and to strive for a "complete change in French policy." The resolution pointed out: French farmers increasingly understand that the unbearable burden caused by the expansion of armaments and war is making French farmers increasingly impoverished. The Executive Bureau also decided to participate in the national conference on striving for peace negotiations, convened by the French National Peace Council on June 27th. Most provinces in France are also preparing to hold farmers' conferences for the defense of peace and agriculture.

    【新华社三日讯】据塔斯社巴黎一日讯：在法国，支持维也纳世界人民和平大会决议的运动开展得越来越广泛。
    据“人道报”报道，法国许多城镇的市政委员会，包括塞纳—瓦斯省、夏朗德省和东比利牛斯省各地市政委员会在内，都主张召开五大国会议来和平解决国际纠纷，主张停止朝鲜战争和印度支那战争，反对国民议会批准波恩和巴黎战争条约。舍尔省议会在共产党议员建议下，通过了决议，要求大国缔结和平公约。各党派的代表和共产党人一起投票赞成这个建议。
    法国农民保卫和平与农业全国委员会执行局在巴黎举行了会议。会上通过决议，要在法国农民中间展开一个运动，争取停止朝鲜战争和印度支那战争，争取和平解决一切国际纠纷，反对国民议会批准波恩和巴黎战争条约，争取“彻底改变法国的政策”。决议指出：法国农民越来越明白：由于扩张军备和战争而造成的不能忍受的负担，使法国农民越来越贫穷。执行局还决定参加法国全国和平理事会订于六月二十七日召开的争取和平谈判全国会议。法国大多数省份也准备召开农民保卫和平与农业会议。
