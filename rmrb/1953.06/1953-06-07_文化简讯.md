	Beijing Film Studio Improves "Newsreel" Production, Completes 19th Issue This Year
	Beijing Film Studio is vigorously improving the production of "Newsreel," ensuring that audiences can see a new issue every week. From January to mid-May this year, nineteen issues of "Newsreel" have been filmed and successively screened for audiences.

	Among the nineteen issues of "Newsreel" that have been completed, some showcase the selfless construction efforts of the Chinese people, such as "Winter Construction of Angang Basic Construction" in Newsreel No. 8, "Angang Worker Zhang Mingshan Successfully Invents Anti-Surround Disk" in No. 13, "Resource Exploration in Daye Mining Area" in No. 14, and "Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant Successfully Trials Thin Steel Sheets" in No. 18. Some depict the great Sino-Soviet friendship, such as "Signing Ceremony of the Final Protocol on the Soviet Union Transferring the China Changchun Railway to Our Country" in No. 1. During the Spring Festival, there were reports on the support of the army and preferential treatment to families of revolutionary martyrs in various places, such as "Comforting the Family of Martyr Dong Cunrui" and "Comforting the Family of Martyr Liu Hulan." There were also reflections of the Chinese people's internationalist spirit, such as "Art Troupe to Comfort the Troops in Korea Arrives at the Korean Front." After the death of Comrade Stalin, two special "Newsreel Specials" mourning Comrade Stalin were quickly completed.

	Beijing Film Studio is currently preparing to film "Newsreel" issues focusing on themes such as "Large-scale Basic Construction of Angang," "Huai River Harnessing Project," "Resource Exploration," "Ma Liu Hai's Advanced Tunneling Method," "Guanting Reservoir," and "Agricultural Production Mutual Aid and Cooperation Movement."

	Wuhan City Launches Ethnic Minority Arts Activities
	Wuhan City recently launched ethnic minority arts activities. The Central South Nationalities Song and Dance Troupe has held five ethnic minority song and dance soirees, featuring performers from more than ten ethnic groups in the Central South region, which have been warmly welcomed by the citizens. On May 27, the Wuhan Cultural Club also held a grand ethnic unity gathering, with more than a thousand people from various ethnic groups joyfully singing and dancing together. The Municipal Federation of Trade Unions' film crew and six projection teams from the Jianghan District have recently been touring factories and suburbs to show films and slides about ethnic minorities. The Municipal People's Broadcasting Station also broadcasts various programs to publicize the people's government's ethnic policies and introduce the lives of ethnic minority people.
