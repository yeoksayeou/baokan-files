This spring, the amount of manure fertilizer applied by farmers in Northeast China generally increased by about 30% compared to last year. The area fertilized has expanded, and the amount of fertilizer applied to the same area has increased. In Shuangfeng Village, Jiaohe County, the fertilized area increased by 20% compared to last year, and the amount of fertilizer applied per hectare increased from 30 cartloads last year to 50 cartloads. In Pingquan County, the fertilized area increased by 10% compared to last year, and the amount of fertilizer applied per hectare increased by 28% compared to last year. In Mengkeli Village, Zhaoyuan County, the total amount of manure fertilizer accumulated by the village increased by one-third compared to last year, with the amount of fertilizer applied per hectare of stubble land increasing from 40,000 jin to 50,000 jin, and the amount applied to plowed stubble land increasing from 5,000 jin to 10,000 jin. In Gaokan Village, a suburb of Shenyang City, the amount of fertilizer accumulated this year increased by 60% compared to last year, and the quality has also improved significantly.

The increase in the amount of fertilizer accumulated in Northeast China this year is inseparable from the development of the manure source excavation campaign. In Dongfeng County, Liaodong Province, the work of excavating manure sources has been carried out well, finding many manure sources that were not widely used in the past. The county originally planned to fertilize 70% of the cultivated land, but as a result, all the cultivated land was fertilized; the amount of fertilizer applied per hectare increased from the originally planned 10 tons to 20 tons. In Sanbaotun and other three villages in the Fourth District of Yi County, Liaoxi Province, pond mud from hemp soaking pools was applied to more than 300 hectares of land.

The combination of manure source excavation work and the patriotic health campaign has also achieved good results. The agricultural departments and health departments of Liaodong Province jointly decided to designate March 10th to April 10th as the "Patriotic Health Campaign Shock Month." During the Shock Month, urban industrial and mining areas cleared garbage and manure, which was transported to rural areas for fertilization. Gaping County excavated a large amount of manure fertilizer near the county seat, and three towns in Hailong County cleared 3.64 million jin of frozen manure and transported it to rural areas.

Although the amount of fertilizer accumulated in Northeast China this spring has increased compared to last year, the shortage of fertilizer is still very serious. According to surveys, according to actual requirements, most areas still lack 15% of the existing fertilizer; individual areas lack 20% or more. Counties such as Shulan and Zhaoyuan have existing manure fertilizer that can only be applied to 50% of the cultivated land, and are still 30% short of the plan.

After the basic completion of spring plowing, farmers in some areas have already started new fertilizer accumulation work, actively exploring fertilizer sources to meet the needs of summer topdressing. Members of the Kaiyuan Qianjin Collective Farm are actively accumulating manure, urine, small ash, kang soil, and sheep manure in order to complete the task of applying topdressing fertilizer to 60% to 70% of the cultivated land. Farmers in Lusheng Village, Hailun County, Heilongjiang Province, after planting major autumn crops, are working from dawn till dusk to carry out manure accumulation work.

### 东北全区今年春季积肥量比去年增加  缺肥现象仍很严重农民正积极准备夏季追肥

    东北全区今年春季积肥量比去年增加
    缺肥现象仍很严重农民正积极准备夏季追肥
    今年春季东北全区农民施用的粪肥，一般地比去年增加了百分之三十左右。施肥面积扩大了，在同一面积上施肥的数量增多了。蛟河县双凤村施肥面积较去年增加百分之二十，单位施肥量由去年每垧地三十车增加到五十车。平泉县施肥面积较去年增加百分之十，单位施肥量较去年增加百分之二十八。肇源县孟克礼村全村所积的粪肥比去年增加三分之一，扣楂地每垧施肥量由四万斤增至五万斤，耲楂地每垧由五千斤增至一万斤。沈阳市郊高坎村今年积肥数量比去年增加百分之六十，质量也有显著提高。
    东北区今年积肥数量的增加，是和开展挖掘粪源运动分不开的。辽东省东丰县挖粪源工作进行的好，找出很多过去没有被普遍利用的粪源。该县原计划在百分之七十的耕地上施肥，结果全部耕地都上了粪；每垧施肥量由原计划十吨增到二十吨。辽西省义县四区三宝屯等三个村挖沤麻池的池泥，上了三百多垧地。
    挖掘粪源工作和爱国卫生运动相结合，也收到了很好的效果。辽东省农业部门与卫生部门曾联合决定从三月十日到四月十日为“爱国卫生运动突击月”。在突击月中城市工矿区清除垃圾粪便，运往农村施肥。盖平县在县城附近挖出大量粪肥、海龙县三个城、镇清出三百六十四万斤冻粪运往农村。
    东北全区今春积肥数量虽然比去年增加了，但缺肥现象仍很严重。据调查，按照实际要求，大部地区现有肥料还缺百分之十五；个别地区缺百分之二十至百分之二十以上。舒兰、肇源等县现有粪肥只能上百分之五十的耕地，按计划尚缺百分之三十。
    春耕基本结束后，目前有的地区的农民又已开始新的积肥工作，积极开辟肥源，以满足夏季追肥的需要。开原前进集体农庄的庄员为了完成在百分之六十到七十的耕地上施用追肥的任务，正积极攒粪尿、小灰、炕土和羊粪。黑龙江海伦县禄生村农民在种完大秋作物以后，又起早贪黑地开展攒粪起肥工作。    （东北行政委员会农业局农产处）
