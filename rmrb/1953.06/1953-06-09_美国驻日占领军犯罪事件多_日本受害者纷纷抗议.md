Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 8th: According to a survey report released by the Japanese police authorities on May 26th, from September 1945, when Japan surrendered, to March of this year, a period of over seven years, the number of criminal cases committed against Japanese citizens by personnel of the so-called Allied occupation forces stationed in Japan, mainly US occupation forces, reached 14,264 cases, even if only those considered "major criminal cases" are counted. The classified figures in this survey report show that among the crimes committed by the occupation forces stationed in Japan, rape cases ranked first, totaling 5,592 cases; theft cases accounted for 4,611 cases; armed robbery and assault cases totaled 3,384 cases; and murder cases numbered 177.

This official figure clearly only reflects a small portion of the countless criminal incidents committed by the US occupation forces stationed in Japan. According to materials released by another Japanese official agency, the Tokyo Procurement Agency (a Japanese agency specializing in handling supplies for foreign occupation forces stationed in Japan), in the year since the San Francisco Separate Peace Treaty with Japan came into effect last April, there have been more than 3,000 cases of atrocities committed by US troops in Tokyo alone.

The crimes of the US occupation forces have aroused righteous indignation among the Japanese public. More and more Japanese victims have shifted from swallowing their anger to actively protesting and demanding compensation for their losses. In Tokyo, 700 Japanese victims of US military atrocities are demanding compensation from the US military. The incident in June of last year in Tokyo where an American soldier beat to death Okubo Yoshio, an employee of the Japan Steel Company, caused angry protests from public opinion, and even the Tokyo Procurement Agency was forced to support the victim's family in their demand for compensation from the US military authorities.

    美国驻日占领军犯罪事件多
    日本受害者纷纷抗议
    【新华社八日讯】东京消息：根据日本警察当局在五月二十六日发表的调查报告，自一九四五年九月日本投降以后到今年三月的七年多期间，以美国占领军为主的所谓盟国驻日占领军人员所犯的侵害日本国民的犯罪案，仅被认为是“主要犯罪案”的就达一万四千二百六十四件。这个调查报告的分类数字表明：在驻日占领军的犯罪案中，以强奸案占第一位，共计五千五百九十二件；偷窃案四千六百一十一件；武装抢劫和殴打案三千三百八十四件；谋杀案一百七十七件。
    这个官方数字显然只能反映数不胜数的美国驻日占领军犯罪事件的一小部分。根据日本另一个官方机关东京调达厅（日本专门办理外国驻日占领军供应事宜的机关）发表的材料，在去年四月旧金山单独对日和约生效以来的一年中，仅东京一地发生的美军暴行就有三千多起。
    美国占领军的罪行已激起日本公众的义愤。越来越多的日本受害人民已从忍气吞声转而积极抗议，并要求赔偿损失。东京有七百起美军暴行的日本受害者要求美军赔偿损失。去年六月在东京发生的美国兵打死日本制钢公司职员大久保义雄的事件，引起了舆论的愤怒抗议，甚至东京调达厅也被迫不能不支持受害者家属向美军当局提出的赔偿要求。
