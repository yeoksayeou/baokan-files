Editor's Note: Since 1949, the Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China has organized an annual survey of basic rural conditions to serve as a basis for determining rural work policies and improving various aspects of rural work. This is a very good approach. Published here is a portion of their survey report from December 1952. Their selection of three relatively advanced villages and two relatively backward villages is representative of the basic situation in rural Heilongjiang Province. It is hoped that the rural work leading organs of all provinces and counties will, within a certain period and on specific issues, select typical villages to conduct similar investigations with rich facts and concrete analysis.

In December 1952, in order to further understand the current rural economic development and various problems in the countryside, and to further improve agricultural production and rural work, we organized more than 50 cadres from relevant departments to conduct economic surveys in five villages in Keshan, Hailun, and Zhaoyuan counties. Minli Village in Keshan, Mengkeli Village in Zhaoyuan, and Jimin Village in Hailun were the advanced villages, while Yanhai Village in Zhaoyuan and Gongnong Village in Keshan were the backward villages.

Concerning Rural Economic Development and Changes in Class Relations

The five villages comprised a total of 1,055 households with 5,530 people, including 1,174 male laborers and 814 female laborers. The cultivated land area was 4,327 hectares. Except for the yellow sandy soil in the two villages in Zhaoyuan, the remaining three villages had black soil and black oil soil, which are of better quality. There were 1,103 draft animals. In 1952, all five villages had a bumper harvest, producing 24,932.11 shi of grain, exceeding the total grain output of 1951 by 66.14%. The unit yield was 5.6 shi per hectare, exceeding 1951 by 67.57%. The best harvest was in Mengkeli Village, Zhaoyuan, where the 1952 grain output exceeded 1951 by 97.5%, and the unit yield exceeded 108%. Due to the bumper harvest, the surplus grain of the farmers in the five villages accounted for 17.43% of the total output in 1952, exceeding 1951 by 9.1%. The marketable grain of the four villages (excluding Yanhai Village) accounted for 42% of the total grain output of the four villages. The largest surplus grain was in Minli Village, Keshan, accounting for 27.24% of the total output. The largest marketable grain was in Jimin Village, Hailun, accounting for 48.6% of the output. (Marketable grain refers to grain that needs to go through the circulation process, while surplus grain refers to the portion remaining after all farmer expenditures.) The main agricultural means of production in the five villages increased in 1952 compared to 1951. Cultivated land increased by 1.89%, draft animals increased by 22.58%, carts increased by 4.2%, and major farm implements increased by 1.98%. The consumption of several major means of livelihood by farmers also increased compared to 1951. For example, cloth increased by 6.19%, cotton increased by 17.4%, salt increased by 5.1%, matches increased by 1.27%, and soybean oil increased by 25.9%. The purchasing power of farmers increased by 16.65% compared to 1951. New changes have taken place in class relations: middle peasants (including well-to-do middle peasants) accounted for 71.67% of the households in the five villages, an increase of 0.39% compared to 71.26% in 1951. Mengkeli Village, Zhaoyuan had the highest proportion of middle peasants, accounting for 82.7%; Gongnong Village had the lowest, accounting for 54.58%. Well-to-do middle peasants in the middle peasant stratum accounted for 23.31% of the households in the five villages, an increase of 4.27% compared to 1951; well-to-do middle peasants in Minli Village accounted for 30.33% of the households, an increase of 7.18% compared to 1951. New rich peasants accounted for 3.03% of the households in the five villages, an increase of 0.18% compared to 1951. New rich peasants in the advanced village of Minli accounted for 1.42%, while those in the backward village of Gongnong accounted for 5.58%. Poor peasants and farm laborers accounted for 24.27% of the households in the five villages (farm laborers 2.56%, poor peasants 21.71%), an increase of 0.43% compared to 1951. Poor peasants and farm laborers in the advanced village of Mengkeli accounted for 15.8%, while those in the backward village of Gongnong accounted for 37.72%. From this, it can be seen that the rural economy has greatly developed. This is reflected in: the total grain output and unit yield have greatly increased, the marketable grain and surplus grain of farmers have increased, and the quantity and quality of the means of production have increased and strengthened. The direct result is the increase in the purchasing power of farmers, and the material conditions for expanding agricultural reproduction are more sufficient. The characteristics of class changes caused by further economic development are: middle peasants continue to account for the vast majority of rural households, and there is no significant change from 1951 on the surface, but well-to-do middle peasants are a faster-growing class among farmers. New rich peasants have developed further. Poor peasants still account for a certain proportion. It can be seen that the proportion of polarization in class changes in advanced villages is very small, while the proportion of polarization towards the two extremes in backward villages is larger. This is a new situation that deserves attention. The specific situation of each class is as follows:

I. Situation of Middle Peasants: Middle peasants (including well-to-do middle peasants) account for 71.65% of the households in the five villages, 73.2% of the labor force, 80.59% of the land, 89.63% of the draft animals, 87.79% of the vehicles, and 89.4% of the farm implements. According to statistics from four villages, middle peasants' surplus grain accounts for 91.39% of the total surplus grain in the four villages. Their marketable grain accounts for 87.67% of the total marketable grain. Middle peasants not only occupy an absolute advantage economically, but also politically. In the five villages, middle peasants and well-to-do middle peasants account for 78.73% of the people's representatives. According to statistics from three villages, they account for 77.4% of the village government committee members. According to statistics from two villages, they account for 74.4% of the mutual aid team leaders. According to statistics from three villages, the family background of Party members is middle peasant and well-to-do middle peasant, accounting for 83.27% of the Party members in the three villages. According to statistics from two villages, the family background of Youth League members is middle peasant and well-to-do middle peasant, accounting for 80.8% of the League members in the two villages. The number of middle peasant households (excluding well-to-do middle peasants) in the two backward villages shows a downward trend year by year. For example, in Yanhai Village, they accounted for 48.04% of the total number of households in 1950, 45.97% in 1951, and 39.23% in 1952.

Well-to-do middle peasants account for 23.31% of the households in the five villages, an increase of 4.27% compared to 1951. (The number of well-to-do middle peasant households in Yanhai Village has shown a trend of increasing year by year, accounting for 20.29% of the total number of households in 1950, 20.64% in 1951, and 31.63% in 1952.) Well-to-do middle peasants account for 49.11% of the middle peasant stratum. Their cultivated land accounts for 67.02% of the cultivated land in the five villages, draft animals account for 80.9%, and carts account for 71.74%. They have relatively complete means of livelihood with good quality, generally owning 7 to 12 hectares of land and 2 to 5 horses or more. They are the strongest class among the farmers. From these five villages, middle peasants have the following characteristics: in addition to being wealthy and having complete means of production, they generally have slight exploitation, which is relatively hidden. They hire a small number of short-term workers, or hire a pig keeper or horse keeper; they use horsepower to exchange for more manual labor within the mutual aid team; they lend surplus grain and surplus capital at interest, or use methods such as pork, grain batches, and raising pigs jointly to exploit in disguised forms. However, some well-to-do middle peasants have strong labor and animal power, and the ratio of labor to land is equal. They have joined agricultural production cooperatives or good mutual aid teams and do not have the above-mentioned forms of exploitation. They have become the most authoritative and enviable class in the countryside.

The entire middle peasant stratum generally has the desire to expand reproduction. In general, middle peasants actively demand to add carts, buy horses, increase farm implements, and produce more grain to catch up with well-to-do middle peasants. They are basically satisfied with getting organized and taking the new road, believing that they can produce more grain. Some well-to-do middle peasants have benefited from better permanent teams or production cooperatives, actively expanding production and resolutely taking the new road. Some are also planning and actively engaged in cattle, horse, sheep, and pig breeding, and engage in handicraft workshops, transportation, etc. Others are somewhat depressed, have concerns about expanding agricultural production, and have an unclear understanding of the direction of development. They "do not know what the future holds," fear being merged into a large pile, and have the negative thoughts of "developing to the end," "maintaining the status quo," and "waiting for poor households." They mistakenly believe that not being allowed to lend at high interest rates, not being allowed to engage in speculation, and not being allowed to bring long-term workers into the group means that development is not allowed. They miss the old road, believing that "to develop, you have to exploit a little." They participate in mutual aid and cooperation organizations somewhat reluctantly, and do not dare to openly hire people to work individually, forming some depression. Some use most of their surplus grain and surplus capital for living consumption, "eat a little, drink a little, wear a little, get a little," and some engage in fake family divisions, "fearing that a big tree will attract the wind." Others want to develop, but are unclear about the direction of operation. They are not very interested in focusing on agricultural development, improving technology, and expanding land investment, and always want to "make money quickly." This is manifested in emphasizing capital and de-emphasizing labor, engaging in "five workshops" (flour workshop, oil workshop, tofu workshop, mill workshop, sugar workshop), pulling carts, and doing petty trading. We analyze the reasons for this: on the one hand, farmers are familiar with the old road and miss it; they know that the new road is good, but they do not fully believe it, and therefore show a certain depression and hesitation. On the other hand, there are some shortcomings and problems in our work and implementation of policies. From these villages, the main problems are: (1) In the spring of 1952, the amount of surplus grain requisitioned was too large, and some district and village cadres adopted coercive methods. Later, interest-free adjustments were adopted in the allocation of grain. (2) The propaganda and implementation of the Party's policies are one-sided. Some people have vaguely proposed "no hiring, no exploitation"; in publicizing the socialist future, they only talk about how good life is, and do not talk enough about improving production. The principle of mutual benefit is not implemented enough within the mutual aid teams; some mutual aid teams and agricultural production cooperatives blindly set up stalls, expand public property, and force carts, horses, and farm implements to be valued and turned over to the public. (3) In actual work, the management policy of focusing on agriculture, improving technology, and expanding land processing has not been grasped enough. (4) The credit cooperation business lags behind rural economic development. (5) The work of encouraging farmers to continuously add carts, buy horses, and expand farm implements within the mutual aid and cooperation organizations has not been done enough. Eliminating the concerns of these middle peasants, especially well-to-do middle peasants, and guiding them to actively expand agricultural re-production is a new problem in the current rural economic development. After our research, we can start from the following aspects: 1. Correctly publicize and implement the Party's comprehensive policies in the countryside, protect farmers' land ownership, resolutely implement the policies of voluntarism, mutual benefit, and democracy in the mutual aid movement, oppose egalitarianism and commandism, implement the principle of "active leadership and steady progress," and overcome the tendency of blind and rash advances. Allow rich peasants to operate legally in society. Unite individual households and support poor households. 2. Repeatedly point out the reasons for getting organized, improving technology, producing more grain, making everyone rich, and taking the new road. 3. Emphasize and grasp technical increase in production, encourage and organize farmers to use surplus capital to add carts, buy horses, expand farm implements, purchase and use pesticides, expand land processing, and focus on agriculture and appropriately promote livestock breeding with conditions. 4. Develop the credit cooperative business.

II. Situation of New Rich Peasants: New rich peasants account for 3.03% of the households in the five villages, 4.43% of the cultivated land, 10.23% of the draft animals, 8.39% of the vehicles, 7.36% of the farm implements, and 3.29% of the male and female labor. The proportion of new rich peasants in advanced villages is small, with Minli Village accounting for 1.42%; the proportion of new rich peasants in backward villages is larger, with Gongnong Village accounting for 5.58% and Yanhai Village accounting for 4.12%. The number of new rich peasants in both villages has been increasing year by year since 1950. In advanced villages, they hire less labor and have more hidden exploitation, which is not very fixed. The forms of exploitation are generally: secretly lending at high interest rates, engaging in speculation and profiteering (such as reselling livestock, reselling grain, etc. Liu Ziyun, a new rich peasant in Gongnong Village, resold more than 40 horses from 1948 to 1952, earning four horses in 1949 alone); hiring workers to operate sideline businesses, using joining the group as a cover, and calling workers outside the group to exchange work within the group; hiring workers under the guise of recruiting relatives to run errands; hiring a large number of short-term workers (in 1952, five new rich peasants in Gongnong Village hired seven long-term workers and four hundred short-term workers). Some even organize fake mutual aid teams for exploitation (such as Li Yougui, a rich peasant in Gongnong Village, with two laborers, 22 hectares of land, and nine horses, organized a mutual aid team of twelve households, including eight poor households without horses, saying it was a "manpower-horse exchange mutual aid team," but in essence it was rich peasant exploitation). Some well-to-do middle peasants secretly envy them, and most farmers despise them. In backward villages, the exploitation of new rich peasants is rampant and blatant. For example, in Gongnong Village, the grain loaned out by six new rich peasants accounts for 48% of the total grain loaned out in the village, with interest rates of 50% or more; five rich peasants openly hire seven long-term workers. A common situation in these five villages is that some district and village cadres verbally promote "no exploitation, no hiring," acting very "leftist," but in actual work, they do not handle it effectively, and they do not recognize hidden forms sufficiently. Some cadres say that they are "well-to-do middle peasants." Many rich peasants also call themselves "well-to-do middle peasants," and carry out rich peasant exploitation under the guise of "well-to-do middle peasants." We believe that the existence and certain development of rich peasants in the countryside at the present stage is unavoidable and not terrible, and it is wrong to propose "eliminate exploitation" and "no hiring." On the other hand, it is also wrong not to restrict the illegal exploitation of rich peasants, not to grasp mutual aid and cooperation in actual work, and to allow the rich peasant economy to run rampant freely. Both of the above errors currently exist and must be overcome.

III. Situation of Poor Peasants: Poor peasants account for 24.27% of the households in the five villages, 18.77% of the labor force, 14.23% of the cultivated land, 4.35% of the draft animals, 4% of the carts, and 3.24% of the farm implements. In the two backward villages, poor peasants and farm laborers account for 32% of the households in the two villages. The reasons for their slow economic development, from their own perspective, are: one is lack of labor, disability, injury, death, and illness (accounting for 15.52% of poor households), two are newly relocated disaster-stricken households (accounting for 29.9%), three are those with many old debts and an empty foundation (accounting for 8.62%), four are those who are in debt from building houses and marrying wives (accounting for 9.22%), five are those without horses or with dead horses (accounting for 15.5%), six are those who "mess around," do not know how to manage, and do not take the right path (accounting for 10.77%), and seven are those who do not work well (accounting for 17.67%). If we examine it from the perspective of work and policy, the following reasons also affect the economic rise of poor peasants: 1. The policy of mutual benefit within mutual aid and cooperation is not implemented enough, and there is general discrimination and exclusion of poor households within the group. The allocation of production tasks, manpower, and animal power is unreasonable. Wealthy households always take advantage, and poor households suffer losses. Poor households do not manage their crops in a timely manner, the cultivation is rough, and they produce less grain, and even abandon land (such as 77 poor households without horses in Gongnong Village abandoning 50 hectares of land, accounting for 80% of the total abandoned land in the village). 2. Mutual aid groups do not combine agriculture with sideline industries enough, and households with carts and horses work individually, not taking poor households along. 3. The State Bank and credit department have egalitarian and fragmented problems in agricultural loans, and cannot fundamentally and systematically solve the problem of means of production for poor households. Poor peasants borrow less, while middle peasants and well-to-do middle peasants borrow more, and poor households borrow more for living expenses and less for means of production. 4. Some burden policies in the countryside are unreasonable, and there is insufficient consideration for poor households under the principle of fairness and rationality. For example, in the reduction and exemption of public grain, middle peasants who should not be reduced and exempted are reduced and exempted, while poor households who should be reduced and exempted are not reduced and exempted; some expenses should be reasonably borne according to labor, land, horses, and vehicles, but are simply allocated equally according to land area. 5. The district and village Party and government leaders have problems in assisting poor peasants to improve their economic situation, one-sidedly exaggerating the shortcomings of a few poor households, not comprehensively analyzing the reasons for their slow rise, working passively, lacking plans, and not being regular. From the investigation of these villages, a lot of work has been done in 1952 to help poor households improve their economic situation, such as adjusting the ratio of manpower and animal power within mutual aid teams, loans from credit departments, and Party education, which has already achieved results. We and the farmers have studied that in the future, in thoroughly implementing the policy of assisting poor farmers, we should mainly focus on the following three points: (1) Thoroughly implement the policy of voluntarism and mutual benefit within mutual aid and cooperation. Cultivation should be adapted to the agricultural season, and poor households should be given equal treatment in agriculture and sideline industries. Discrimination and exclusion against them should be opposed. (2) A portion of the funds from the credit department should be invested in a planned manner, and the main portion should be lent to poor households to help them solve the problem of horses, farm implements, and other means of production, and to overcome egalitarianism. (3) The district and village Party and government leaders should regularly carry out this work in a planned manner, and Party member cadres should play an exemplary role, educate the masses, and make everyone realize that it is an honor to assist poor households under the principle of voluntarism and mutual benefit, so as to form a trend; at the same time, poor peasants should also be educated to work diligently, rely on their own efforts, and quickly catch up with the middle peasants.

The new situation after the bumper harvest in these villages is: the economic situation of farmers participating in agricultural production cooperatives has generally improved. The ten members of the Jia Runtang Cooperative in Hailun have 100 shi of surplus grain, and 16 of the 18 members of the Yang Xianting Cooperative in Keshan had actual incomes in 1952 exceeding those of 1951. The production and living standards of farmers participating in mutual aid teams have also improved. Poor households have also improved in terms of living standards, but there has not been much change in terms of means of production, because mutual aid teams have not been managed well, they either have not participated in mutual aid teams, have no capital, plant less fine grain (soybeans, wheat), and have many old debts; a small portion of the surplus of some poor farmers in 1952 has been pressed into the "public property" of the group. All classes urgently demand to expand reproduction, demand to clarify the direction, demand to establish and develop credit cooperative businesses, demand that supply and marketing work catch up, demand the use of new farm implements, and hope that we will improve the method of grain purchase.

Due to the development of production, the promotion of the mutual aid and cooperation movement, the bumper harvest in 1952, and the significant improvement in mutual aid and cooperation in recent years, the wealth ownership of the original classes in these villages has undergone new increases. Middle peasants, especially well-to-do middle peasants, have developed greatly; new rich peasants have increased, and old forms of exploitation are becoming increasingly hidden; the economic status of poor peasants has improved, but their economic rise is still extremely slow. This is the general situation of class changes in the five villages, which can generally represent the new situation of general economic development and class relations changes in the current rural areas of Heilongjiang Province.

Concerning the Work of Weak Villages

From the investigation of Yanhai Village in Zhaoyuan and Gongnong Village in Keshan, two weak villages, we deeply feel that improving the work of weak villages and changing the slow economic development of weak villages is one of the important links in further improving rural work and comprehensively developing the rural economy. If we do a good job in the work of about 15% of the province's weak villages, our province's rural work will have a great improvement, and the potential agricultural power will be further developed.

The economic development of these two weak villages is slow, the class differentiation is large, the rise of poor peasants and farm laborers is slow, the proportion of middle peasants is smaller than that of general villages, and the development of well-to-do middle peasants is fast, and there are many new rich peasants.

The old road prevails, and poor households are exploited. The new rich peasants and well-to-do middle peasants in the two villages generally have the idea of walking the old road under the banner of the new road. They adopt various hidden or open forms of exploitation. The foundation of mutual aid and cooperation is weak, the mutual aid teams are small and low-level, and individual households account for a certain proportion. The number of organized households in the two villages accounts for 58% of the total number of households. Seasonal teams account for 32.43% of the mutual aid and cooperation organizations, and temporary teams account for 57.46%. Most mutual aid teams have not implemented the policy of mutual benefit. The ratio of manpower and animal power is unreasonable, and the rotation system is also extremely unreasonable. The households without horsepower are always poorly managed. No accounts are settled, no work is found, and wealthy households implement patriarchal leadership in the group, and poor households are bullied.

The agricultural cultivation of the two villages is relatively rough, which affects production development. Gongnong Village has had uncultivated land every year since 1949, and the output has declined year by year.

For such weak villages, the county and district leaders often abandon leadership or lack leadership. District cadres cannot go to weak villages, and sometimes when they go, they do not go deep, do not solve problems, and easily believe false reports.

The Party leadership in these villages is weak: some Party members have serious rich peasant thoughts and exploitation behaviors, and some have degenerated; of the 14 Party members in Yanhai Village, only two female Party members have not participated in exploitation. Five Party members hire workers, and five Party members lend at high interest rates. Guo Zhongxiao, the secretary of the branch, has hired workers for three consecutive years. The common characteristics of Party members in these two villages are: Party members do not implement the Party's mutual aid and cooperation policies, take the lead in working individually, and take the lead in engaging in "two-person cooperatives." They falsely report achievements to the higher levels, oppress the masses at the lower levels, praise new rich peasants, and exclude poor households. Party, government, Youth League, and other organizations are impure. Some bad elements have infiltrated, and some have been usurped by rich peasants. The Party's policies are distorted and undermined. Cadres use the "old road" label to indiscriminately restrict people, but in reality, they abandon leadership over mutual aid teams. On the surface, they blindly call on the masses to engage in large groups and establish production cooperatives, and openly promote egalitarianism in grain purchase: "Lower the high ones, raise the short ones, and wait for the ones that are neither high nor short"; in reality, they do not restrict the illegal exploitation of rich peasants, but support the illegal exploitation of rich peasants, and they do not actively support poor households, but attack poor households; the burden policy is also unfair and unreasonable. The masses' thinking is chaotic, which seriously affects the enthusiasm for production.

In the future, leadership should be strengthened for such weak villages, and the following tasks should be grasped:

1. Thoroughly and correctly publicize and implement the Party's policies in all aspects of the countryside, combine the mass democratic movement from bottom to top, combine village elections, solve some existing problems (such as disbanding village government mess units, canceling extra burdens on the masses, etc.), clarify the masses' thinking, restore the impact, and improve farmers' enthusiasm for production.
2. Conscientiously rectify mutual aid teams, lead low-level teams well, correct the tendency of blindly engaging in large groups and spontaneous cooperatives, conditionally establish credit departments, and crack down on usurious exploitation. The State Bank and credit department can allocate more funds to weak villages, focusing on helping poor households purchase means of production.
3. County and district leaders should formulate plans, assign special personnel to be responsible for the work of weak villages, regularly go deep into weak villages, solve problems, accumulate experience, and prevent the phenomenon of tightening first and then loosening, and lacking regular leadership from occurring.

Improving the work of weak villages is very important. If it is not done well, these villages will be "dead ends" for agricultural production and rural work, which will affect the overall development and improvement of the rural economy and mutual aid and cooperation. As long as we can grasp it, the work will definitely change, and the masses in weak villages are eagerly demanding and waiting for us to strengthen our work.

    黑龙江省五个村经济情况的调查
    中共黑龙江省委调查组
    编者按：中共黑龙江省委从一九四九年起每年都有组织地进行一次农村基本情况的调查，做为决定农村工作政策和改进农村各项工作的根据。这是一种很好的办法。这里发表的是他们在一九五二年十二月间所作的调查报告的一部分。他们所选择的三个工作比较先进的村子和两个工作比较落后的村子，是能够代表黑龙江省农村的基本情况的。希望各省各县的农村工作领导机关都能在一定期间，对一定问题，选择典型乡村进行同样的有丰富的事实和具体的分析的调查。
    在一九五二年十二月间，为了进一步了解当前农村经济发展情况和农村中的各种问题，进一步提高农业生产，改进农村工作，我们组织了所属有关部门的干部五十余人，分别在克山、海伦、肇源三县五个村进行经济情况的调查。克山民立村、肇源孟克里村、海伦济民村三个村是先进村，肇源沿海村、克山工农村是落后村。
    关于农村经济发展和阶级关系变化
    五个村共一○五五户，五五三○人，男劳动力一一七四人，女劳动力八一四人。耕地面积四三二七垧，除肇源两村是黄沙土外，其余三村都是黑土和黑油土，土质较好。耕畜一一○三匹（头）。一九五二年这五个村都丰收，产粮二四九三二点一一石，超过一九五一年粮食总产量百分之六十六点一四。单位产量每垧五点六石，超过一九五一年百分之六十七点五七。收成最好的是肇源孟克里村，一九五二年粮食产量超过一九五一年百分之九十七点五，单位产量超过百分之一○八。因为丰收，一九五二年五个村农民的余粮占总产量百分之十七点四三，超过一九五一年百分之九点一。四个村（缺沿海村）的商品粮占该四个村粮食总产量百分之四十二。余粮最多的是克山民立村，占总产量百分之二十七点二四。商品粮最多的是海伦济民村，占产量的百分之四十八点六。（商品粮是指需要经过流通过程的粮食，余粮是指农民全部开支外的剩余部分。）五个村农业主要生产资料一九五二年比一九五一年都增加了。耕地增加百分之一点八九，耕畜增百分之二十二点五八，大车增加百分之四点二，主要农具增加百分之一点九八。农民几种主要的生活资料的消费量比一九五一年也增涨了。如：布增加百分之六点一九，棉花增加百分之十七点四，盐增加百分之五点一，火柴增加百分之一点二七，豆油增加百分之二十五点九。农民购买力比一九五一年提高了百分之十六点六五。阶级关系有了新的变化：五个村中农（包括富裕中农）占户数百分之七十一点六七，比一九五一年的百分之七十一点二六增加百分之○点三九。中农比重最多的是肇源孟克里村，占百分之八十二点七；最少的是工农村，占百分之五十四点五八。在中农阶层中的富裕中农，占五个村户数的百分之二十三点三一，比一九五一年增加了百分之四点二七；民立村富裕中农占户口百分之三十点三三，较一九五一年增涨了百分之七点
    一八。五个村新富农占户数百分之三点○三，比一九五一年增加了百分之○点一八。先进村民立村的新富农占百分之一点四二，落后村工农村占百分之五点五八。五个村贫农和雇农占户数百分之二十四点二七（雇农百分之二点五六，贫农百分之二十一点七一），比五一年增加百分之○点四三。先进村孟克里村的贫雇农占百分之十五点八，落后村工农村占百分之三十七点七二。由此可见，农村经济有了很大的发展。表现在：粮食总产量与单位产量大大提高了，农民的商品粮和余粮增多了，生产资料的数量质量增多和加强了，其直接结果就是农民购买力的提高，农业扩大再生产的物质条件更加充分。经济进一步的发展所引起的阶级变化的特点是：中农继续占农村户口绝大多数，从表面看比一九五一年无显著变化，但富裕中农在农民中是发展较快的一个阶层。新富农有了新的发展。贫困农民也还占一定比重。可以看出：先进村阶级变化两极分化的比重很小，而落后村阶级向两极分化的比重则较大。这是值得注意的一种新情况。各阶层的具体情况如下：
    一、中农情况：五个村中农（包括富裕中农）占户口百分之七十一点六五，劳动力占百分之七十三点二，土地占百分之八○点五九，耕畜占百分之八九点六三，车辆占百分之八七点七九，农具占百分之八九点四。中农余粮，据四个村统计，占四个村余粮总数的百分之九一点三九。他们的商品粮占商品粮总数的百分之八七点六七。中农不仅在经济上占绝对优势，在政治上亦占优势，五个村的人民代表，中农、富裕中农占百分之七八点七三。据三个村统计，村政府委员中，他们占百分之七七点四。据两个村统计，互助组长中他们占百分之七四点四。据三个村统计，党员的家庭成分是中农和富裕中农的占三村党员数的百分之八三点二七。据两个村统计，青年团员家庭成分是中农和富裕中农的占两村团员数的百分之八○点八。两个落后村的中农（富裕中农除外）户数则有逐年下降的趋势，如沿海村，一九五○年占总户数的百分之四八点○四，一九五一年占百分之四五点九七，一九五二年占百分之三九点二三。
    富裕中农占五个村户口的百分之二三点三一，比五一年增加了百分之四点二七。（沿海村的富裕中农户数有逐年增加的趋势，一九五○年占总户口数的百分之二○点二九，一九五一年占百分之二○点六四，一九五二年占百分之三一点六三。）富裕中农占中农阶层的百分之四九点一一。他们的耕地占五村耕地的百分之六七点○二，种畜占百分之八○点九，大车占百分之七一点七四。他们的生活资料比较齐备，质量也好，一般土地在七至十二垧，耕畜在二匹至五匹马以上。他们是农民中力量最强的阶层。从这五村看，中农具有以下特点：除生活富裕、生产资料齐备外，一般有轻微剥削，且较隐蔽。他们雇少量短工，或雇一个猪倌、马倌；利用马力在互助组内换较多人工；以余粮余资放债，或用猪肉、批粮、分养猪等办法变相剥削。但也有一部分富裕中农人马力强，劳力土地相等，参加了农业生产合作社或好的互助组，没有上述剥削形式。他们已成为农村中最有权威最引人羡慕的阶层。
    整个中农阶层绝大多数有扩大再生产的要求；一般中农积极要求添车买马、增补农具、多打粮食、赶上富裕中农。他们对组织起来走新道路基本上是满意的，认为能多打粮食。一部分富裕中农在较好的常年组或生产合作社中得到了好处，积极扩大生产，坚决走新道路，一部分人也打算和正在积极经营牛、马、羊、猪牧畜业，搞手工作坊、运输业等。另一部分人有些苦闷，对扩大农业生产有顾虑，对发展方向认识不明确，“不知将来到什么份上”，怕归大堆，有“发展到头”“维持现状”
    “等一等贫困户”的消极思想。他们误认为：不许放高利贷，不许投机倒把，不允许带长工入组，就是不允许发展了。他们留恋旧道路，认为“要发展就得剥削点”。他们参加互助合作组织有些勉强，公开雇人单干又不敢，形成了某些苦闷。有人把余粮余资大部分用到生活消费上去，“吃点、喝点、穿点、得点”，还有的搞假分家，“怕树大招风”。另一些人想发展，但对经营方向不明确，对于以发展农业为主、提高技术、扩大土地投资兴趣不大，总想“快门来财”。表现在重资本、轻劳动，搞
    “五坊”（粉坊、油坊、豆腐坊、磨坊、糖坊）、拉脚、作小买卖等。我们分析其中的原因：一方面是农民熟习旧道路，留恋旧道路；知道新道路好，但不完全相信，因此表现出一定的苦闷和犹豫。另一方面是我们工作中和执行政策中有些缺点和问题。从这几个村看，主要是：（1）一九五二年春季征购余粮数量过多，某些区、村干部又采用了强迫命令方式，后来调剂粮食中采用了无利调剂的做法。（2）宣传与执行党的政策有片面性，有人笼统提出“不许雇人，不许剥削”；宣传社会主义前途只讲生活如何好，对于提高生产讲得不够。在互助组内贯彻两利不够；有些互助组、农业生产合作社盲目摆摊子，扩大公共财产，强使车马农具作价归公。（3）对于以农业为主，提高技术，扩大土地加工的经营方针，在实际工作上抓得很不够。
    （4）信贷合作事业落后于农村经济发展。（5）互助合作组织内部鼓励农民不断地添车买马的工作做得不够。消除这部分中农，特别是富裕中农的顾虑，引导他们积极扩大农业再生产，是目前农村经济发展中的一个新问题。经我们研究，可从以下几方面着手：1、正确宣传、执行党在农村的全面政策，保护农民土地所有权，坚决贯彻互助运动中的自愿、互利、民主的政策，反对平均主义、命令主义，贯彻执行“积极领导、稳步前进”的方针，克服盲目冒进偏向。允许富农在社会上合法经营。团结单干户，扶持贫困户。2、反复指出组织起来、提高技术、多打粮食、大家富裕、走新道路的道理。3、强调与抓紧技术增产，鼓励与组织农民以余资添车买马，增补农具，购用农药，扩大土地加工，抓紧农业并适当地有条件地提倡牧畜业。4、发展信贷合作事业。
    二、新富农情况：新富农占五个村户口的百分之三点○三，耕地占百分之四点四三，耕畜占百分之一○点二三，车辆占百分之八点三九，农具占百分之七点三六，男女劳力占百分之三点二九。先进村新富农占的比重小，民立村占百分之一点四二；落后村新富农占的比重较大，工农村占百分之五点五八，沿海村占百分之四点一二，两村从一九五○年以来新富农都是逐年增多的。在先进村，他们雇佣劳动少，隐蔽剥削多，且不大定型。剥削形式大体有：暗地放高利贷，投机倒把（如倒卖牲口、倒卖粮食等。工农村新富农刘子云从一九四八年到一九五二年捣卖四十多匹马，一九四九年一年就赚了四匹马）；雇工经营副业，以入小组做掩护，在组外叫工到组内换工；以招亲戚养跑腿为名来雇工；大量雇短工（工农村一九五二年五户新富农雇了七个长工、四百个短工）。有的甚至组织假互助组进行剥削（如工农村富农李有贵，两个劳动力，二十二垧地，九匹马，组织了一个十二户参加的互助组，其中无马贫困户八户，说是“人马换工互助组”，实质上是富农剥削）。一部分富裕中农暗中羡慕他们，大多数农民鄙视他们。在落后村新富农剥削很猖狂，也很露骨。如工农村，六户新富农放出的贷粮就占全村贷粮总数的百分之四八，利息都在五分以上；五户富农公开雇七个长工。这五个村的共同情况是：某些区、村干部口头宣传“不许剥削人、不许雇工”，表现很“左”，但在实际工作中则处理不力，对隐蔽形式认识不足，有的干部说他们是“富裕中农”。不少富农也自称为“富裕中农”，在“富裕中农”外衣下进行富农剥削。我们认为：在现阶段农村富农的存在和有某些发展，不可避免也不可怕，提出“消灭剥削”、“不许雇人”是错误的。另方面，对富农的非法剥削不进行限制，在实际工作中不抓紧互助合作，听任富农经济自由泛滥，也是错误的。上述两方面错误目前都存在，必须加以克服。
    三、贫困农民情况：贫农占五村户口的百分之二十四点二七，劳力占百分之一八点七七，耕地占百分之一四点二三，耕畜占百分之四点三五，大车占百分之四，农具占百分之三点二四。两个落后村，贫雇农共占两村户口的百分之三二。他们经济发展迟缓的原因，就他们本身来说，一种是无劳力、残废、伤力、死人、得病的（占贫困户百分之一五点五二），二种是新移来的受灾户（占百分之二九点九），三种是旧债多底子空的（占百分之八点六二），四种是盖房子娶老婆负债的（占百分之九点二二），五种是无马、死马的（占百分之一五点五），六种是“瞎倒腾”，不会经营，不走正路的（占百分之一○点七七），七种是劳动不好的（占百分之一七点六七）。如从工作和政策上检查，影响贫困农民经济上升的还有以下几点原因：1、互助合作内部两利政策贯彻的不够，组内普遍歧视和排斥贫困户，生产轮作、人马换工不合理，富裕户处处占便宜，贫困户吃亏，贫困户庄稼侍弄不应时，耕作粗糙，少打了粮食，甚至扔了地（如工农村七十七户无马的贫困户扔了五十垧地，占全村撂荒地的百分之八十）。2、互助组农副业结合不够，有车有马户单干，不带贫困户。3、国家银行、信贷部在农贷方面有平均主义、零碎分散的毛病，不能从根本上有计划地解决贫困户生产资料问题。贫困农民借得少，中农、富裕中农借得多，而贫困户借的生活资料多、生产资料少。4、农村某些负担政策不合理，在公平合理原则下照顾贫困户也不够。如公粮减免，不应减免的中农减免了，应减免的贫困户反而没有得到减免；有些花费应按劳力、土地、马匹、车辆合理负担，却只是平均按地亩摊派。5、区、村党政领导方面扶助贫困农民的工作有毛病，片面夸大少数贫困户的缺点，不从全面分析其上升迟缓原因，工作被动，缺乏计划，没有经常性。从这几个村的调查看：一九五二年扶助贫困户经济上升的工作做了不少，如调整互助组内部人马工比价、信贷部贷款、党内教育等，已收到了效果。我们和农民研究，今后在彻底贯彻扶助贫困农民这一政策中，主要应抓紧下列三条：（一）互助合作内部彻底贯彻自愿两利政策。耕作要适应农时，在农副业结合等方面给予贫困户以平等待遇，反对歧视、排斥他们。（二）部分信贷部的资金应有计划地投放，主要部分应借给贫困户，帮助他们解决马匹、农具及其他生产资料问题，克服平均主义。（三）区、村党政领导方面应经常有计划地进行这个工作，党员干部要起模范作用，教育群众，使大家认识在自愿互利原则下扶助贫困户是光荣的事情，以便形成风气；同时也要教育贫困农民勤劳生产，自力更生，迅速赶上中农。
    这几个村丰收后的新情况是：参加农业生产合作社的农民的经济情况普遍上升。海伦贾润堂社十户社员余粮一百石，克山杨显亭社十八户社员有十六户社员一九五二年实际收入超过了一九五一年。参加互助组的农民的生产和生活也提高了。贫困户在生活方面也有提高，但在生产资料方面变化不大，原因是互助组没有搞好，他们或没有参加互助组，没有资本，种的细粮少（大豆、小麦），旧债多；部分贫困农民一九五二年的少部剩余被压到组内“公共财产”上去了。各阶层一致迫切要求扩大再生产，要求明确方向，要求建立与发展信贷合作事业，要求供销工作赶上去，要求使用新农具，希望我们改进购粮方法。
    由于几年来生产的发展、互助合作运动的推行，加上一九五二年丰收及互助合作有了显著的提高，这几个村原阶层的财富占有都有了新的增涨。中农特别是富裕中农有了很大的发展；新富农有增加，旧的剥削形式日益隐蔽；贫困农民经济地位有改善，但经济上升仍极迟缓。这就是五个村阶级关系变化的总情况，大体上也可以代表黑龙江省目前农村一般的经济发展与阶级关系变动的新情况。
    关于薄弱村的工作
    从肇源沿海村、克山工农村两个薄弱村的调查看，我们深切感到提高薄弱村的工作，改变薄弱村经济发展迟缓的状况，是进一步提高农村工作，全面地发展农村经济的重要环节之一。如果我们把全省约百分之十五左右的薄弱村的工作做好，我省的农村工作将有一个很大的提高，农业潜在力量将能进一步得到发挥。
    这两个薄弱村经济发展迟缓，阶级分化较大，贫雇农上升迟缓，中农比重较一般村小，其中富裕中农发展快，新富农多。
    旧道路占上风，贫困户受剥削。两村的新富农、富裕中农普遍存在打着新道路旗帜走旧道路的思想，他们采取多种多样的隐蔽的或公开的形式进行剥削。互助合作的基础薄弱，互助组小形式低级，单干户占一定比重。两村组织起来户口占总户口百分之五十八。互助合作组织中季节组占百分之三二点四三，临时组占百分之五七点四六。大部分互助组内未贯彻两利政策，人马工比价不合理，轮作制也极不合理，无马力的户侍弄的总是不好。不结账，不找工，富裕户在组内实行家长式的领导，贫困户受欺侮。
    两村的农业耕作都比较粗糙，影响生产发展。工农村一九四九年以来每年都有撩荒地，产量逐年下降。
    对于这样的薄弱村，县、区领导方面常期放弃领导或领导不够，区干部不能去薄弱村，有时去了不深入，不解决问题，轻信假报告。
    这些村子里的党的领导是薄弱的：一部分党员有严重的富农思想和剥削行为，有的已蜕化变质；沿海村十四名党员，未参加剥削的只有两名女党员。五名党员雇工，五名党员放高利贷，支部书记郭忠孝连雇三年大活。这两村党员的共同特点是：党员对党的互助合作政策不执行，带头单干，带头搞什么“二人合作社”。对上假报成绩，对下压迫群众，表扬新富农，排斥贫困户。党、政府、青年团等组织不纯，有的钻进了坏蛋，有的被富农篡夺了领导。党的政策被歪曲、被破坏。干部以“旧道路”帽子到处乱卡人，实际上却放弃对互助组的领导。表面上到处盲目号召群众搞大组，成立生产合作社，在购粮中公开宣传平均主义：“高的削一削，矮的提一提，不高不矮等一等”；实际上不是限制富农非法剥削，而是支持富农非法剥削，不是积极扶持贫困户，而是打击贫困户；负担政策也不公平合理。群众思想紊乱，严重影响了生产积极性。
    今后对于这样的薄弱村应加强领导，抓紧以下工作：
    1、深入地正确地宣传、贯彻党在农村各方面的政策，结合自下而上的群众性的民主运动，结合村选，解决存在的一些问题（如解散村公所伙食单位，取消群众额外负担等），澄清群众思想，挽回影响，提高农民的生产积极性。
     2、切实整顿互助组，领导好低级组，纠正盲目搞大组、搞自发合作社的偏向，有条件地建立信贷部，打击高利贷剥削。国家银行及信贷部可多拨款给薄弱村，着重扶持贫困户购买生产资料。
    3、县、区领导方面应订出计划，派专人负责薄弱村的工作，经常深入薄弱村，解决问题，积累经验，防止先紧后松，无经常领导的现象发生。
    提高薄弱村工作是很重要的。搞不好，这些村子将是农业生产、农村工作的“死角”，将影响农村经济、互助合作的全面发展与提高。只要我们能抓紧，工作面貌一定会改变，薄弱村群众是热烈地要求与等待我们去加强工作的。
