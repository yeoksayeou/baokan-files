Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: Under the rule of monopoly capital in the United States, children suffer all kinds of torture and poisoning, and they are cheap objects of exploitation and enslavement. Many American children, from the moment they are born, become things used for profit in America's money-worshipping society.

In most major cities across forty-eight states of the United States today, there exists a shocking "baby trading market." Many children are treated as "commodities" to be bought and sold even in their infancy.

Approximately two weeks ago, a six-year-old girl named凯泰 (Kǎitài) in Florida became a new sacrifice to the dollar. 凯泰 (Kǎitài)'s money-grubbing father turned training young children in water skills into a profitable business. Before she was even a year old, 凯泰 (Kǎitài) began being submerged in water for crawling practice. In mid-May this year, this abused and emaciated little girl was forced to perform a thirty-three-foot high dive for the amusement of wealthy people. Due to her young age and frailty, she suffered severe injuries upon entering the water. In less than a few hours, this American child, living in the cannibalistic American society, died of internal bleeding.

However, such tragedies of American infants and young children are only fragments of the total suffering of American children today. Millions upon millions of American children are subjected to torment and hardship.

Driven by hunger, many American children begin selling their labor from the age of six or seven. They become one of the most important sources of maximum profit for American monopoly capitalists. In many workplaces, children as young as six or seven often do heavy work alongside adults. Some children work nine and a half to twelve hours a day, but they only receive half the wages of adult workers. In the southern regions of the United States, some children sometimes don't even receive wages after working hard for farmers. According to statistics, there were at least six million children last year who had to work to earn their daily bread.

Poverty is the fate of the vast majority of American children. Even according to U.S. government statistics, nearly 57 percent of American children are from families with incomes below the minimum subsistence level. More than one-fifth of American children live like beasts of burden in families with incomes barely sufficient for minimum subsistence. Countless American children are starving in unemployed families unable to make a living.

This large group of children, aptly described by "New York Times" reporter Freeman as "children who have never enjoyed happiness," mostly live in slums. In New York City alone, more than 500,000 families with children grow up in slums. They never receive the care and support they deserve from society. When they are hungry, they can only tighten their belts; on cold days, they can only tear down advertising posters in front of movie theaters to cover themselves and keep warm; when they are sick, they cannot even get the most basic treatment.

Many American children can't even afford to eat, so going to school naturally becomes an unattainable dream. The rate of out-of-school children is increasing across the United States. In some states, 92 percent of children currently do not receive a complete education. Millions of children have to drop out of school due to their inability to pay tuition fees. Even those children who are fortunate enough to have the opportunity to study do not receive a good education. Because the U.S. government uses huge amounts of tax revenue for expanding armaments and preparing for war, children's education facilities are very poor. For example, according to a survey by the American "Nation" magazine, in Kentucky, three-fifths of schools currently have only one classroom, and one-third of schools have no toilet facilities in the school buildings. In such schools, children are instilled with war hysteria. In elementary schools in American cities, there are so-called atomic bomb prevention drills. The New York City Department of Education even ordered all elementary school students to wear tags with their names on them, saying that when an atomic bomb kills people, bodies can be identified by the tags.

The most insidious poisoning of American children by American monopoly capital is large-scale yellow propaganda. They systematically publish tens of millions of copies of so-called "funny story comic books" that specialize in depicting crime. According to a recent statistic on the content of ninety-two different "funny story comic books" in the United States, two hundred and sixteen of them depict major criminal cases, eighty-six depict pornography, three hundred and nine depict minor criminal cases, five hundred and twenty-two depict assault cases, and fourteen depict techniques for murder for money. These "funny story comic books," coupled with movies, novels, and other forms of poisoning that specifically promote aggression, war, murder, rape, and kidnapping, devastate the minds and bodies of American children, and their morals are deteriorating day by day. The U.S. Department of Social Welfare's Bureau of Education admits that there are currently "more than five million registered children with physical, intellectual, and moral defects" in the United States. The number of juvenile delinquents is increasing. An eleven-year-old girl in Georgia committed the crime of alcoholism, a child in Detroit shot and injured someone at the age of four, and a teenager in Philadelphia who committed car theft as a child was recently arrested for murder for money. Two teenagers beat a pedestrian to death on the road while competing with each other, and another girl killed her mother because her mother blamed her for often returning late at night… Such news is endless in American newspapers. According to statistics, every year in the United States, between 250,000 and 400,000 adolescents under the age of eighteen are imprisoned for crimes. In thirty-four of the forty-eight states in the United States, there are 100,000 children locked up in prisons, living with murderers, rapists, and lunatics in shackles.

### 美国儿童遭受种种摧残和毒害

    美国儿童遭受种种摧残和毒害
    【新华社讯】在垄断资本统治下的美国，儿童遭受着种种摧残与毒害，他们是廉价的剥削和奴役对象。美国许多儿童甚至从出生起，就成为美国金元社会中用来牟利的东西。
    在今日美国四十八个州大多数大城市里，都存在骇人听闻的“婴孩交易市场”，许多儿童还在婴孩期间，就被当作“商品”来买卖。
    大约在两个星期以前，佛罗里达州的一个年仅六岁的小女孩子凯泰，成了美元的新的祭品。凯泰的死要钱的父亲把训练幼儿水技作为一宗赚钱的生意。凯泰在不足周岁时就开始被浸在水里练习爬行。今年五月中旬的一个早上，这个备受虐待和瘦骨??的小女孩被迫从事三十三英尺高台跳水表演，以供有钱人玩赏。由于年幼体弱，她在入水时受了重伤。不到几个钟头，这个生活在吃人的美国社会中的美国儿童就因体内出血而夭折了。
    但是，美国婴孩与幼童的这种悲剧，还不过是今日美国儿童的全部苦痛的一些片断而已。美国千千万万儿童都是受尽磨折，受尽苦难。
    在饥饿的驱使下，美国许多儿童从六七岁开始就要出卖自己的劳动力。他们成为美国垄断资本家最大利润的重要来源之一。在许多工作场所里，六七岁的小孩经常和成年人一起做沉重的工作。有的儿童每天要工作九个半钟头至十二个钟头，但他们领到的工资却只有成年工人的一半。在美国南部地区里有些儿童替农场主辛辛苦苦工作后，有时甚至还领不到工资。这一类为了赚取每日的面包而不得不工作的儿童，据统计去年最少有六百万。
    贫困是美国绝大多数儿童的命运。即使根据美国政府统计材料，美国差不多也有百分之五十七的儿童是收入低于最低生活所需水平的家庭的。五分之
    一以上的美国儿童在收入仅够最低生活水平的家庭中过着牛马般的生活。无数美国儿童在无法维生的失业家庭中挨饿。
    这一大批被“纽约时报”记者费利曼恰当地称为
    “从来没有享受过幸福的儿童”，大多住在贫民窟里。单单在纽约一地，就有五十多万家儿童是在贫民窟中长大的，他们从来没有得到社会应有的照顾与抚养。在饥饿的时候，他们只有勒紧裤带；在大冷天，他们只有扯下电影院门前的广告纸盖在身上御寒；在生病的时候，他们甚至得不到最起码的治疗。
    美国许多儿童吃饭都谈不上，上学自然就更成为无法实现的幻想。美国各地失学儿童的比率正愈来愈大。在美国有些州内，目前百分之九十二的儿童都没有受过完善的教育。上百万的儿童因无法缴纳学费，不得不中途辍学。即便是幸而有机会读书的儿童，也得不到良好的教育。由于美国政府把巨额的捐税收入都用在扩军备战，儿童教育的设施非常恶劣。例如，根据美国“民族”周刊的调查，在肯塔基州内，目前五分之三的学校只有一间教室，三分之一的学校在校舍中没有厕所设备。在这样的学校里，儿童被灌输着战争歇斯底里的思想。在美国各城市的小学校里，都有所谓原子弹预防演习。纽约市教育处甚至曾经命令全体小学生挂上写有自己名字的牌子，说是当原子弹把人炸死后，可以凭牌认尸。
    美国垄断资本对美国儿童的最阴险的毒害还是大规模的黄色宣传。它们有计划地出版成千万份专门描写犯罪的所谓“滑稽故事连环画”。据最近对美国九十二种不同的“滑稽故事连环画”的内容的一个统计，其中就有二百十六篇是描写重大的犯罪案的，八十六篇是描写色情的，三百零九篇是描写较小的犯罪案的，五百二十二篇是描写殴打案的，十四篇是描写谋财害命的技巧的。这些“滑稽故事连环画”加上专门宣传侵略，战争，谋杀，奸淫，绑票的电影、小说以及其他毒害形式，使美国儿童的身心受到摧残，他们的德行一天比一天败坏。美国社会福利部教育局承认：目前美国“已经登记的在体格上，智力上与德行上有缺陷的儿童有五百多万名”。儿童犯罪的数目正愈来愈多。佐治亚州一个十一岁的女孩就犯上酗酒罪，底特律一个儿童四岁就开枪伤人，费城一个在小时犯过汽车盗窃罪的少年，最近又因谋财害命被捕。有两个少年因为互相比高下而在路上打死了一个行人，另外一个女孩子因为她母亲怪她常常深夜不归就杀死了她的母亲……这种新闻在美国报刊上是层出不穷的。据统计，美国每年都有二十五万到四十万十八岁以下的少年儿童因犯罪而入狱。在美国四十八个州的三十四个州里，正有十万儿童被关在牢狱中，和带着铐镣的杀人犯、奸淫犯和疯子生活在一起。
