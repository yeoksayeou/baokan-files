Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, June 16th: The World Peace Council meeting opened on the 15th in the Building and Carpentry Workers' Union Hall here. Attending the meeting were members of the World Peace Council, as well as many prominent figures invited by the Council – leaders of various groups who are engaged in the struggle for peace in their respective countries, but have not yet had direct relations with the World Peace Council, and representatives holding various views. Although these well-intentioned people follow different paths in their activities to strive for peace, and although they hold different views on certain or even many issues that are currently attracting the attention of world opinion, this cannot prevent people from different countries from gathering together to discuss issues of great importance to all countries – the issues of world peace and security, and easing international tensions.
	
    A blue banner was hung on the presidium of the conference, with the word "Peace" written in twenty languages.

    Representatives of Hungarian people's organizations and working people were in the audience. Many journalists from the Hungarian and international press also attended the meeting.

    At the beginning of the first meeting, Tibor Erdey-Grúz, Minister of Higher Education of the Hungarian People's Republic, congratulated the meeting on behalf of the Hungarian government and all the people. Then, Mrs. Isabelle Blume (Belgium), a member of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council, delivered a speech commemorating the outstanding French peace fighter, Yves Farge. The audience stood in silence as she spoke of Yves Farge's great contributions to the cause of peace and his tireless and courageous struggle for peace and friendship between nations.

    Member of the World Peace Council, Emmanuel d'Astier de la Vigerie, delivered the opening speech. He said that the President of the World Peace Council, Frédéric Joliot-Curie, was unable to attend the meeting due to illness, and the Vice-President of the World Peace Council, Pietro Nenni, was also unable to come to Budapest due to the Italian parliamentary elections.

    In his speech, d'Astier de la Vigerie recalled the special meeting of the World Peace Council held in Berlin in July 1952. He pointed out that the Berlin meeting emphasized the German question and the question of stopping the ongoing war, and adopted a resolution on preparing for the World People's Peace Congress. The World People's Peace Congress was held at a time of great international tension. The congress aroused a widespread response around the world and answered most of the questions that troubled the public.

    D'Astier de la Vigerie emphasized that the Vienna Congress called for the world to pay attention to the necessity and possibility of holding negotiations. At the Vienna Congress, the ultimate goal was already set – an agreement among the five major powers, which we call a peace pact. This pact will surely enable international cooperation to be restored and open the way to disarmament.

    The Vienna Congress expressed a universal desire, which the people of all countries expressed unyieldingly, making it possible to resume the exchange of views and hold negotiations again.

    D'Astier de la Vigerie said that while the International Committee for the implementation of the Vienna Congress resolution was carrying out its work, two important things happened. The proposal on the issue of Korean prisoners of war made it possible to reach the first agreement, and most importantly, the armistice negotiations were resumed, thereby opening the road to resolving the Korean War.

    He continued, exchanges of views began. The Soviet government solemnly declared that all unresolved issues, including those with the United States, could be resolved peacefully. In the West, Eisenhower also responded. The first part of his speech was a comment on the Vienna World People's Peace Congress. He condemned war and described the enormous disasters and losses it caused. However, Eisenhower, in the second part of his speech, put forward conditions that would make negotiations impossible. He demanded that the whole of Germany should be armed and join the Western alliance, while the people's democracies should abandon their systems. Nevertheless, the exchange of views continued.

    The Soviet Union responded to Eisenhower through "Pravda." "Pravda" said that it would be ridiculous to expect the Soviet Union to interfere to change the system of the people's democracies or to stop the national liberation movement in colonial countries.

    Nevertheless, the Soviet Union still said that it was ready to negotiate on resolving all disputed issues without any preconditions.

    Therefore, a new situation has emerged, which has aroused great hope all over the world. More and more people are beginning to support the proposal to hold negotiations. In the ruling groups of some countries, some of the most famous political leaders are now also proposing to hold meetings and conduct negotiations, although they had only recently considered expansion of armaments, continuation of the current war, economic difficulties, and the use of force to maintain peace to be unavoidable.

    D'Astier de la Vigerie mentioned the speeches of Churchill and Attlee and the suggestions of the Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference. He also said that some newspapers that had never abandoned hope for a policy of force have now changed their tune. The hope for easing international tensions is growing day by day, gradually replacing the Cold War; the spirit of the crusades, like the spirit of distrust, has receded.

    He said that what we need to do now is to seek new ways to attract all the people and groups who have recognized the necessity and possibility of holding negotiations to the struggle for peace.

    There are still some forces that oppose holding negotiations. Holding limited negotiations to discuss individual issues will help to counter this opposition and open the road to easing international tensions. Up to now, reaching an agreement between the major powers is still our main task. But we have no preconditions. We welcome any peaceful method, initiative, and negotiation to achieve this goal.

    D'Astier de la Vigerie pointed out that opposition to holding negotiations is reflected in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's resolution on continuing to expand armaments, in Adenauer's opposition to holding a Four-Power Conference, in Adenauer's desire to arm Germany, and in Syngman Rhee's statement opposing the agreement on the issue of exchanging prisoners of war. This opposition is also reflected in the talks of some American politicians, who advocate that the United States withdraw from the United Nations and oppose all international cooperation. We must not let those who oppose negotiations prevail. We will never allow the United Nations to be weakened or eliminated. One of the greatest responsibilities of the World Peace Movement is to constantly express support for everyone to cooperate in this international organization. No country should withdraw from this organization. The United Nations can only play a role when it becomes a truly global organization, representing all countries in the world.

    D'Astier de la Vigerie then spoke about the upcoming Bermuda Conference. He said that the Bermuda Conference should not aim to hinder the Four-Power Conference by proposing preconditions.

    D'Astier de la Vigerie pointed out that the agreement on the exchange of prisoners of war in Korea is a prelude to the armistice, and it is expected that the armistice will be achieved in the near future. This agreement is a great victory for peace, and therefore also our victory.

    He pointed out that there are now many new signs that have aroused people's hopes for further easing of international tensions. These signs are: the recent proposal of the German Democratic Republic to provide new prospects for German unification, the Soviet Union's decision on the Austrian and Berlin issues, and the attitude adopted by the Commonwealth.

    D'Astier de la Vigerie finally pointed out that the victories achieved by the forces of peace are not yet consolidated. The signs of easing international tensions are not very reliable. The task of this World Peace Council meeting is to do everything possible to consolidate the victories already achieved by the forces of peace and to ensure new victories. The World Peace Council meeting will support all measures that can accelerate the easing of international tensions. In order to achieve this goal, tens of millions of people should be involved in the efforts to strive for peace.

    Our goal has always been to ensure that decisions reached through consultation prevail over decisions based on force. When the possibility of successful negotiations is very small, we demand negotiations. However, negotiations on a very important Korean issue are finally about to succeed. Now, there are many serious problems in Asia and Europe waiting to be resolved. In Europe, Germany is still divided and occupied, and Austria is also occupied. Some people are still trying to drag them into war alliances. Negotiations must now be held to end this situation and to ensure respect for their independence and security.

    There are no ready-made methods or absolute conventions for negotiations. We can talk from general to specific, or from specific to general. It is necessary for us to open two paths: one is the path of achieving agreements one by one, which will lead to a comprehensive solution; the other is the path of a comprehensive agreement, that is, the conclusion of a peace pact, which will facilitate the solution of individual problems. The people of all countries and their peace-loving forces cannot act separately. They must reach agreements with each other to determine their common goals and methods, to influence public opinion and governments, and to strive for their victory. This is the goal of the World Peace Council.

    After Emmanuel d'Astier de la Vigerie spoke, Jean Lafitte, Secretary-General of the World Peace Council, presented the agenda and procedures of the conference on behalf of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council. He suggested that all issues in the current international situation be discussed under the first item on the agenda, which is entitled: "Holding Negotiations and Easing International Tensions"; the second item on the agenda will discuss the tasks and composition of the World Peace Council.

    The meeting passed the conference agenda.

    Then, Guo Moruo, a member of the World Peace Council, spoke. He talked about the peaceful settlement of the Korean armistice and the Far East issues. (Full text will be published separately)

    The following also spoke: Elfes (Germany), General Cavalcanti (Brazil), Reiner Bovaire (Switzerland), and Salamaya (Colombia).

    The next meeting is scheduled for the morning of the 16th.

    讨论关于世界和平与安全等问题
    世界和平理事会会议开幕
    【新华社十六日讯】塔斯社布达佩斯十六日讯：世界和平理事会会议于十五日在此间建筑业与木工工会大厦开幕。出席会议的有世界和平理事会理事，还有理事会邀请的许多社会名流——他们是在各自国内进行争取和平的斗争、但到现在还没有和世界和平理事会发生直接关系的各种团体的领袖和抱着各种见解的代表。这些善良的人们在争取和平的活动中虽然遵循着不同的道路，对目前世界舆论所注意的某些、甚至许多问题虽然抱着不同的观点，但是这并不能阻止这些不同国家的人们聚集一堂来讨论对所有国家都非常重要的问题——关于世界和平与安全以及缓和国际紧张局势的问题。
    大会主席台上悬挂着一幅蓝色的横旗，旗上用二十种文字写着：“和平”。
    在旁听席上，有匈牙利人民团体和劳动人民的代表。匈牙利和世界各国报界的许多记者也参加了会议。
    在第一次会议开始时，匈牙利人民共和国高等教育部部长蒂波尔·埃尔德·格卢斯代表匈牙利政府和全体人民向会议祝贺。接着，世界和平理事会常务委员会委员伊莎贝丽·布伦姆夫人（比利时）发表演说，纪念卓越的法国和平战士伊夫·法奇。听众们全体肃立，静听她谈伊夫·法奇对于和平事业的伟大贡献和他为争取和平与各国间友谊所进行的不懈的和勇敢的斗争。
    世界和平理事会理事爱麦虞埃·达斯迪埃·德拉维热里致开会辞。他说：世界和平理事会主席弗雷德里克·约里奥—居里因病不能出席会议，世界和平理事会副主席彼特罗·南尼也由于意大利议会选举不能到布达佩斯来。
    达斯迪埃·德拉维热里在发言中追述一九五二年七月在柏林举行的世界和平理事会特别会议，他指出：柏林会议强调提出了德国问题和停止正在进行的战争的问题，会上并通过了一项关于筹备世界人民和平大会的决定。在举行世界人民和平大会的时候，正是国际局势非常紧张的时候。大会引起了全世界广泛的响应，并且答复了使公众感到不安的大部分问题。
    达斯迪埃·德拉维热里强调指出：维也纳大会要求全世界注意到举行谈判的必要性和可能性。在维也纳大会上，已经规定了最后目标——五大国协定，我们称这协定为和平公约，这个公约一定会使国际合作能够恢复，并且打开通向裁减军备的道路。
    维也纳大会表达了一个普遍的愿望，各国人民不屈不挠地表示了这个愿望，这使得恢复交换意见和重新举行谈判成为可能。
    达斯迪埃·德拉维热里说：当执行维也纳大会决议的国际委员会正在进行它的工作时，有两件重要的事情发生了。关于朝鲜战俘问题的建议使得第一个协议得以达成，最重要的是，恢复了停战谈判，通向解决朝鲜战争的道路从而被打开了。
    他继续说：交换意见开始了。苏联政府郑重地宣布：所有争执未决的问题，包括与美国的问题在内，都可以用和平的方法解决。在西方，艾森豪威尔也作了答复。他的演说的第一部分是评论维也纳世界人民和平大会的。他谴责战争和说明战争所造成的巨大的灾害与损失。但是艾森豪威尔在他的演说的第二部分却提出了足以使谈判成为不可能的条件。他要求：整个德国应该武装起来，并且加入西方联盟，同时人民民主国家应该抛弃它们的制度，尽管如此，交换意见仍在继续进行。
    苏联通过“真理报”向艾森豪威尔作了答复。“真理报”说：如果希望苏联出来干涉，以改变人民民主国家的制度或阻止殖民地国家的民族解放运动的话，那未免太荒唐了。
    尽管如此，苏联还是说，它随时准备进行解决所有争执问题的谈判，而没有任何先决条件。
    因此，新的局面出现了，这已经在全世界各地引起了极大的希望，愈来愈多的人民开始支持举行谈判的建议。在某些国家的统治集团中有些最著名的政治领袖现在也提议举行会议并进行谈判，虽然他们就在最近还认为扩张军备、继续目前战争、经济困难以及用武力来维持和平是不可避免的事。
    达斯迪埃·德拉维热里提到邱吉尔和艾德礼的演说和英联邦总理会议的建议。他并说，某些以前从来也没有抛弃过对武力政策的希望的报纸现在也改变了它们的调子。关于缓和国际紧张局势的希望日益增涨，这种希望正逐渐代替着冷战；十字军的精神像不信任的精神一样退到后面去了。
    他说，现在我们所需要做的是寻求新的方法，来把所有凡是已经认识到举行谈判的必要性和可能性的人们和团体吸引到争取和平的斗争中来。
    仍然还有一些势力反对举行谈判。举行有限范围的谈判来讨论个别问题将有助于对抗这种反对的势力，并打开走向缓和国际紧张局势的道路。到现在为止，在大国之间达成协议还是我们的主要任务。但是我们并没有什么先决条件。任何为达到这一目的的和平方法、倡议和谈判，我们都是欢迎的。
    达斯迪埃·德拉维热里指出，对于举行谈判的反对，表现在北大西洋公约组织关于继续扩军的决议上，表现在阿登纳反对举行四大国会议上，表现在阿登纳的武装德国的愿望上，还表现在李承晚发表的反对关于交换战俘问题协议的声明上。这种反对也反映在某些美国政客的谈话中，他们主张美国退出联合国并反对国际间的一切合作。我们决不能让这些反对进行谈判的人占上风。我们决不允许削弱或消灭联合国。世界和平运动最大的责任之一就是不断地表示拥护大家在这个国际机构中合作。没有一个国家应该脱离这个机构。联合国只有在它成为一个真正的世界性机构，代表世界上所有的国家的时候，才能发挥作用。
    达斯迪埃·德拉维热里继而谈到即将举行的百慕大会议。他说，百慕大会议不应抱着提出先决条件来阻挠四国会议的目的。
    达斯迪埃·德拉维热里指出，在朝鲜关于交换战俘问题的协议是停战的序幕，预料在最近将来停战即可实现。这个协议是和平的伟大胜利，因此也是我们的胜利。
    他指出，现在有许多新迹象，引起了人们对于国际紧张局势进一步缓和的希望。这些迹象是：德意志民主共和国最近为德国统一提供新前景的建议、苏联在奥地利和柏林问题上的决定以及英联邦所采取的态度。
    达斯迪埃·德拉维热里最后指出，和平力量所取得的胜利还不很巩固。国际紧张局势缓和的迹象还不十分可靠。这一次世界和平理事会会议的任务是尽一切可能巩固和平力量已经取得的胜利，并保证取得新的胜利。世界和平理事会会议将支持能够加速缓和国际紧张局势的一切办法。为了要达到这个目的，还应该使千千万万的人们参与争取和平的努力。
    我们努力的目标一直是：保证以协商方式得出的决定战胜以武力作为基础的决定。在谈判成功的可能性很小的时候，我们就要求举行谈判。然而，一个很重要的朝鲜问题的谈判终于快要获得成功。现在，亚洲和欧洲还有许多严重的问题等待解决。在欧洲，德国还是分裂着，并被占领着，奥地利也被占领着。有人还企图把他们拖入战争联盟。现在必须举行谈判来结束这种局面，并保证尊重它们的独立与安全。
    谈判并没有现成的方式或绝对的成规。我们可以从一般谈到个别，也可以从个别谈到一般。我们有必要开放两条途径：一条是一个个地取得协议的途径，这样将可以导致全面的解决；另一条是全面协议的途径，也就是缔结和平公约，这将便利个别问题的解决。各国人民和他们爱好和平的力量不能各别地行动。他们必须彼此取得协议，以确定他们共同的目标和方法，以影响舆论和政府，以努力争取他们的胜利。这就是世界和平理事会的目标。
    在爱麦虞埃·达斯迪埃·德拉维热里发言以后，世界和平理事会总书记让·拉裴德代表世界和平理事会常务委员会提出大会议程和程序。他建议，把当前国际形势中的一切问题都归在议程的第一项中讨论，这一项议程名为：“举行谈判及缓和国际紧张局势”；第二项议程将讨论世界和平理事会的任务和组成。
    会议通过了这个大会议程。
    接着由世界和平理事会理事郭沫若发言。他谈到关于朝鲜停战和远东问题的和平解决的问题。（全文另发）
    接着发言的有：艾尔费斯（德国）、卡瓦尔康蒂将军（巴西）、雷纳·波瓦尔（瑞士）、萨拉麦亚（哥伦比亚）。
    下次会议定于十六日上午举行。
