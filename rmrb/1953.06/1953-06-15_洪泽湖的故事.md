The Story of Hongze Lake
By our reporter Bai Yuan

In April this year, at the Sanhe Sluice construction site on the shore of Hongze Lake in the lower reaches of the Huai River, I heard that there was a fishing village called Sanhe Village not far from the sluice gate construction site. I really wanted to see their life, so I went to Jiangba Town next to the construction site to ask where this village was. People told me to inquire on the lake beach. An old man on the lake beach who was selling cigarettes next to the sluice gate construction site said, "There is a Sanhe Village, but no one knows where it is now." But he explained that it is now on Hongze Lake. Standing on the lake beach and looking out over Hongze Lake, there was a vast expanse of lake water, with countless boats floating on it. At this time, someone next to me pointed and told me that there was a group of boats gathered together on the distant lake surface, and those were the boats of Sanhe Village. This is a village on the water. Every morning, they go to the lake together, cast their nets and fish together. Around noon, they take the fish they catch to Jiangba Town to sell, and after eating, they go to the lake again together.

I found them on another evening. At this time, their boats were all docked together. A gentle spring breeze blew from the southeast of Hongze Lake, from the direction of the sluice gate, gently sweeping across the wide surface of Hongze Lake. Among the dozens of fishing boats in this village called Sanhe Village, an old man of fifty-one years old invited me to sit down on the bow of one of the boats. His name is Zhu Genxuan. Sitting next to him was his brother, Zhu Genzhen, who is forty years old this year. They had just finished dinner. Zhu Genzhen's wife was washing the pots and pans at the stern. Two children were running around inside and outside the cabin. Three generations of their family have been fishing on Hongze Lake, but until Zhu Genxuan and Zhu Genzhen took over the life from the previous generation, they still only had a small fishing boat. Later, the War of Resistance Against Japan broke out. Guerrilla forces organized by the Communist Party appeared on Hongze Lake. The people's struggle was boiling in the waves of Hongze Lake. At night, they and everyone else used boats to carry the guerrillas to attack the enemy's strongholds around Hongze Lake, and they often transported grain from the shore to the guerrillas on the lake; during the day, they fished on the lake. Under the protection of the guerrillas, their life began to slowly improve. By the time they defeated Japanese imperialism, they had accumulated some money, so they bought some wood and built a boat themselves. The two brothers separated, letting Zhu Genzhen take his wife and a newborn child to live on this new boat. This was how they each had a home, thinking that they could live a peaceful life. But before long, under the direction of American imperialism, the Kuomintang army replaced the Japanese imperialist army to attack the Chinese people. The war started again.

It was one night in October 1947. Zhu Genzhen's boat was carrying a small team of guerrillas from Hongze Lakekou to the south bank of Sanhe to attack the enemy. But when the guerrillas landed and arrived at the village, the enemy had run away. When Zhu Genzhen's boat was returning in the darkness carrying the guerrillas, it hit a willow stump in the water near the north bank of Sanhe, and the bottom of the boat was punctured. The guerrillas landed on the north bank of Sanhe. Zhu Genzhen and his wife used some rags and cotton to plug the hole, put the child on the boat, and pulled the boat along the riverbank with ropes to a village next to the shore. By this time, it was already dawn. They had a great-aunt living in the village. Zhu Genzhen and his wife stayed at their great-aunt's house, repaired the boat for a day, and planned to return to Hongze Lake after spending the night. The next morning, they carried the child to the shore and saw that the boat was gone. After inquiring, they found out that a Kuomintang Baozhang who had come from the opposite bank during the night had taken their boat away. This homeless couple searched everywhere with their two-year-old child, and finally found out that the boat was tied to a beach next to a village on the opposite bank. They went a long way around, ran to a ferry crossing and crossed the river, and ran straight to the village, staring at their boat, squatting from mid-afternoon until dark. Zhu Genzhen let his wife take the child on the boat, untied the rope, grabbed two oars, and paddled desperately towards the middle of the river. Zhu Genzhen's wife held the child in one hand and rowed the scull with the other. In this way, the two of them drove the boat, speeding through the turbulent waves, and finally returned to Hongze Lake.

The old man Zhu Genxuan finished telling his brother's experience in one breath, then stretched out a hand, patted the boat board beside him, and said, "This is the origin of this boat." The night became quieter and quieter, and the southeast wind blew in gusts from afar, occasionally hearing songs broadcasted from the loudspeaker over at the sluice gate. Zhu Genzhen sat silently next to the old man, listening.

The old man lit the cigarette I handed him, and continued to speak eloquently: "No matter how many tricks the enemy has, when it comes to Hongze Lake, it can't twist us around, but that time was really dangerous..." That was not long after Zhu Genzhen and his wife had snatched the boat back. One evening, they and dozens of other fishing boats docked together. That day, hundreds of guerrillas were living in Jiangba Town. Near dusk, without warning, the enemy entered the town. There was no time for other ways to deal with the enemy, and hundreds of people ran to these dozens of fishing boats together. Across the lake entrance, half a mile away from where these dozens of boats were docked, was a reed-covered beach. All the dozens of boats rowed to the beach. That day, Zhu Genzhen happened to be on the street and didn't have time to get on the boat, so he was captured by the enemy. They pointed their guns at him and asked, "How many guerrillas are on the boats over there!" "There are no guerrillas on the boats," he said. "If there are no guerrillas, what are they doing over there?" "They saw the army coming and were afraid, they are all honest people, General." It was getting dark, they looked at the lake and there was no movement, so they let him go. In the second half of the night, the guerrillas waded through the reeds and returned to Hongze Lake.

In this way, they tangled with the domestic enemy for another two years. In February 1949, the Liberation Army crossed the Sanhe River from the edge of Hongze Lake, and in April crossed the Yangtze River, liberating the entire motherland. Before long, people already felt that everything was over, life was about to start anew, and it was going to be different. People began to think about the future, about a new life. The water of Hongze Lake rose and fell every year, and it hadn't changed in thousands of years. Why shouldn't this lake water be changed? Thinking and thinking, hey, watching this lake of water, it doesn't rise when it should rise, and it doesn't fall when it should fall.

This happened after the second half of 1950. Originally, the rise and fall of the water in Hongze Lake was due to the Huai River. Every year between summer and autumn, when the flood season arrives, the floodwaters of the Huai River pour into Hongze Lake from the upper and middle reaches, and the lake water rises at this time. After the flood season is over, the floodwaters of the Huai River are discharged downstream through Hongze Lake, and the lake water falls. Year after year, the water of Hongze Lake always rises and falls like this. And each rise and fall causes a disaster for the people on both sides of the Huai River. Since Chairman Mao issued the call to "be sure to harness the Huai River well," millions of people have been building reservoirs, sluice gates, digging river channels, and building dikes day and night in the Huai River basin to control the water of the Huai River. It was not long after that that the water in Hongze Lake did not rise when it should have risen. But sometimes, when the sluice gates on the Huai River released water, Hongze Lake rose again. After two years of this, the water in the lake became less and less every day. Because the lake water rose and fell uncertainly, and the water became less and less every day, the fish in the lake also gradually decreased. Fishermen drove their boats on the lake, casting their nets from the lake surface as usual, but when they pulled up the nets, they often only caught many large and small stones from the shallow water. Sometimes, a boat would only catch three or four jins of small fish the size of two or three fingers for the whole day. So the People's Government, cooperatives, and aquatic products companies continuously issued loans, clothes, and food to help them. In order to take better care of the lives of the fishermen, the local government also separated them from the residents on land and organized lake fishermen's villages for them. Then, the People's Government led the fishermen on Hongze Lake to carry out democratic reforms and eliminated the feudal forces of the "net land" [Note] owners. In this way, people's lives and the world around them were changing together, and the changes were so amazing that it felt as if the fishermen who had lived on Hongze Lake for generations were watching the entire lake change. "Now if you go to Hongze Lake, many new lake beaches have emerged from the shallow water," the old man Zhu Genxuan said, pointing to the wide lake water, his eyes flashing with magical light. "At first, when we saw that the water in this lake was different, some superstitious people said that something might have happened to the Water Dragon King. In fact, what Water Dragon King is there? There are only human Dragon Kings," the old man paused, turned his face and looked at the construction site over at Sanhe Sluice, "Look at those who are turning the rivers and seas upside down there, if they are not called human Dragon Kings, what else can they be called?"

Following the eyes of the old man Zhu Genxuan, under the dark night sky, a brilliant electric light shone, and the sound of machines and the sound of metal colliding rumbled in the quiet night. Just as the old man Zhu Genxuan said, those who were turning the rivers and seas upside down were working there day and night. They are building a large sluice gate more than 690 meters long there. Now, the concrete of the sluice gate has been poured, and the gate is being installed. The sluice gate project is nearing completion. It is one of the largest and most modern sluice gates among the many sluice gates built in the Huai River basin. The entire sluice gate needs to install a total of sixty-three gates, each gate is ten meters wide, and all are opened and closed by electricity. After this large sluice gate is completed, closing the gate can store the river water flowing down from the upper and middle reaches of the Huai River in Hongze Lake; then, a waterway to the Yangtze River will be dug from here along the Baoying Lake and Gaoyou Lake in the lower reaches of the Huai River, and all the vast lake water of Baoying Lake and Gaoyou Lake will be drained. Then, the opening and closing of the sluice gate will be used to control a certain flow rate of the waterway to the Yangtze River, so that the Huai River will flow docilely into the Yangtze River. The lake water stored in Hongze Lake can continuously supply the irrigation and shipping water volume of the entire northern Jiangsu Province along its eastern irrigation canal and the southeast waterway to the Yangtze River. How magical! You just have to think: opening the electric switch of the sluice gate, letting the gate automatically open and close, and the water of one lake after another can be drained; arid areas will no longer lack water; places where boats cannot travel can now travel; watching Hongze Lake, which is becoming drier and drier, is about to fill up, and it will be changed again. After storing the water flowing down from the upper reaches of the Huai River in Hongze Lake, the fish from the Huai River will also gather in Hongze Lake to settle down. In this way, Hongze Lake will not only become a large reservoir, but also a large fish reservoir. However, the old man Zhu Genxuan said that they are worried about one thing: after the sluice gate is completed and the entire Hongze Lake is filled with water, the lake surface will be wider and the wind and waves on the lake will be bigger. Only large sailing ships and steamships will be able to sail on the lake, and small wooden boats like theirs will not be able to go to the lake. But, on second thought, there is really no need to worry. We have defeated countless fierce enemies and have a way to change the water of a Hongze Lake. Is there no way to change our small wooden boats?

[Note] In the past, the feudal class occupied plots of lake surface on the lake. Fishermen had to pay them heavy rents to cast their nets and fish there. The feudal rulers called the lake surface they occupied "net land."

    洪泽湖的故事
    本报记者  白原
    今年四月里，我在淮河下游洪泽湖边的三河闸工地上，听说离水闸工地不远，有一个叫三河村的渔民村。我很想去看看他们的生活，于是就到工地旁边的蒋坝镇去问这个村子在什么地方。人们让我到湖滩上去打听。湖滩上一个在水闸工地旁边摆纸烟摊子的老头子说：“是有一个三河村，可是谁也不知道它现在在什么地方。”但他又解释说，它现在是在洪泽湖上。站在湖滩上往洪泽湖上望去，一片茫茫的湖水，无数船只在上面飘荡。这时候，旁边有一个人指点着告诉我，在远远的湖面上，有一群聚在一起的船只，那就是三河村的船只。这是一个水上的村子。每天一清早，他们就一起到湖上去，一同撒网打鱼，快到中午的时候，他们把打到的鱼拿到蒋坝镇上卖了，吃过饭，就又一起到湖上去了。
    我找到他们，那是在另一天的晚上。这时候，他们的船只都在一起靠了岸。轻柔的春风从洪泽湖东南方的水闸那边吹过来，轻轻地掠过洪泽湖的宽阔的水面。在这个叫做三河村的几十只渔船中间，一位五十一岁的老头子招呼我在一只船的船头上坐下来。他的名字叫朱艮宣。旁边坐着他的兄弟，叫朱艮珍，今年四十岁了。现在，他们刚刚吃过晚饭。朱艮珍的妻子正在舱尾刷洗锅碗。两个小孩在舱里舱外跑来跑去。他们一家三代在洪泽湖上打鱼，可是一直到朱艮宣和朱艮珍从前一代人手里把生活接替下来的时候，还是只有一只小小的渔船。后来，抗日战争爆发了。洪泽湖上出现了共产党所组织的游击队。人民的斗争在洪泽湖的波浪里沸腾起来。夜里，他们和大家一起用船只载着游击队去袭击洪泽湖周围敌人的据点，并且还常常从岸上给湖上的游击队运送粮食；白天就在湖上打鱼。在游击队的保护下，他们的生活开始慢慢地好起来。等到打败日本帝国主义那一年，他们已经积聚了一点钱，于是就买了些木料，自己造了一只船，兄弟两个分开来，让朱艮珍带着妻子和一个刚刚生下的小孩住到这只新的船上。这样才算各人都有了个家，心想可以过一过太平日子了。可是没有多久，在美国帝国主义的指使下，国民党的军队代替日本帝国主义的军队来向中国人民进攻。战争又打起来了。
    那是一九四七年十月的一天夜里，朱艮珍的船上载着一小队游击队，从洪泽湖口到三河南岸去袭击敌人。但是游击队上了岸，到了村子里，敌人却跑掉了。当朱艮珍的船在黑夜里载着游击队返回来的时候，在靠近三河北岸的水里撞着一根柳树椿子，把船底撞了一个窟窿。游击队在三河北岸上了岸。朱艮珍和妻子用一些破布和棉花把窟窿塞了塞，把小孩放在船上，就沿着河岸用绳索把船拉到岸旁的
    一个村子前面。这时候天已经明了。他们有一个姑奶奶住在村里。朱艮珍夫妇在姑奶奶家里待下来，把船修整了一天，准备过一夜再回洪泽湖去。第二天清早他们抱着孩子走到岸边一看，船不见了。一打听，原来是夜里从对岸过来的一个国民党保长把他们的船弄走了。这一对无家可归的夫妇抱着两岁大的孩子到处寻找，最后才打听到船被拴在对岸一个村子旁边的河滩上。他们绕了老远，跑到一个渡口过了河，就一直跑到那个村子旁边，瞅着自己那只船，从半下午蹲到天黑。朱艮珍让妻子抱着小孩上了船，把绳索一解，抓着两只桨，拼命向河心里划。朱艮珍的妻子一只手抱着小孩，一只手摇起橹来。就这样，两个人驾着船，在翻腾的风浪里飞奔着，终于回到了洪泽湖上。
    朱艮宣老头子一口气说完了他兄弟的这一段经历，然后伸出一只手来，拍拍身旁的船板说：“这就是这一只船的来历。”夜晚越来越清静，东南风一阵阵地从远方吹过来，偶尔可以听到水闸那边的播音器播送出来的歌声。朱艮珍一直坐在老头子的旁边，默默地听着。
    老头子把我递给他的一根纸烟点燃，又滔滔地说起来了：“不管敌人有多少办法，到了洪泽湖上，它就怎样也扭不过我们，只是那一回，可真险呵，……”那是在朱艮珍夫妇两个把船抢回来不久以后的事情。有一天傍晚，他们和几十只渔船一起靠了岸。那一天有几百个游击队住在蒋坝镇上。快天黑的时候，没有提防，敌人就进了镇。其他对付敌人的办法都来不及了，几百个人一起跑到这几十只渔船上。和这几十只船所停泊的地方相隔有半里路的湖口的对岸，是一片长满苇子的草滩。几十只船通通划到了草滩上。那一天朱艮珍正好在街上，没有来得及上船，就被敌人捉住了。他们用枪口对着他，问：“那边船上有多少游击队！”“船上没有游击队，”他说。“没有游击队，他们都跑到那边去干什么？”“他们看见军队来了害怕，都是一些老实百姓，老总。”天黑了，他们看看湖边没有一点动静，这才放了他。到下半夜，游击队就涉水穿过草滩，回洪泽湖里面去了。
    就这样，他们又和国内的敌人纠缠了两年。一九四九年二月解放大军从洪泽湖边渡过三河，四月渡过长江，解放了整个祖国。不用多久，人们已经感觉到一切都过去了，生活要重新开始，要换一个样子了。人们开始想到将来，想到新的生活。洪泽湖的湖水每年落了又涨，涨了又落，千百年来，也没有变过一回，为什么这一湖的水就不该换一换呢？……想着想着，嘿，眼看着这一湖大水，该涨的时候不涨，该落的时候也不落了。
    这是一九五○年下半年以后发生的事情。本来，洪泽湖的湖水的涨落，都是因为淮河的关系。每年夏秋之间，汛期一到，淮河的洪水从上游、中游滚滚地倾泻到洪泽湖里来，这时候，湖水就涨了。等到汛期一过，淮河的洪水经过洪泽湖从下游排泄出去，于是，湖水就落了。一年过去了又一年，洪泽湖的湖水总是这样涨涨落落。而每一次的涨落，就给淮河两岸人民造成一次灾难。自从毛主席发出了“一定要把淮河修好”的号召以后，数百万人民在淮河流域日日夜夜地修水库，造水闸，挖河道，筑堤防，把淮河的河水管束起来。就是从那以后没有多久，洪泽湖的湖水该涨的时候也不涨了。可是有时候，淮河上面的水闸一放水，洪泽湖却又涨起来，这样过了两年，湖里的水就一天比一天少起来了，因为湖水涨落不定，而且水一天比一天少，湖里的鱼也渐渐减少了。渔民们在湖上驾着船，像往常一样把鱼网从湖面上撒下去，可是等到把网拉起来的时候，从浅水里打上来的常常只是许多大大小小的石头。有时候，一只船整整一天只打到三、四斤两三个指头那么大的小鱼。于是人民政府、合作社、水产公司就连续不断地发贷款，发衣服和粮食来帮助他们。为了更好地照顾渔民的生活，当地政府又把他们和陆上的居民分开来，为他们组织了湖上的渔民的村子。接着，人民政府又领导洪泽湖上的渔民进行了民主改革，消灭了“网地”〔注〕所有者的封建势力。就这样，人们的生活和周围的世界都一起在变化着，而且变化得简直使人感觉到惊奇，就好像世世代代生活在洪泽湖上的渔民眼看着整个湖水在变化的时候一样。“现在你到洪泽湖里面去看看，许多新的湖滩都从浅水里露出来了，”朱艮宣老头子一边说着，一边指着那一片宽阔的湖水，眼睛里闪着神奇的目光。“一开头，眼看着这个湖的水不一样了，有些迷信的人还说，怕是水龙王出了什么事了，其实，有什么水龙王？只有人龙王，”老头子停了一下，转过脸来望着三河闸那边的工地，“你看在那里翻江倒海的，不叫人龙王，还能叫什么？”
    随着朱艮宣老头子的眼睛望过去，在黑夜的天空下面，照耀着一片灿烂的电光，机器的声音，钢铁碰击的声音，在静夜里隆隆地响。像朱艮宣老头子说的一样，那些翻江倒海的人们，正在那里日夜不停地工作着。他们在那里建筑一座六百九十多公尺长的大水闸。现在，水闸的混凝土已经浇灌完毕，正在开始安装闸门。水闸工程快要完成了。那是淮河流域所建筑的许多水闸当中一座最大的也是最新式的大水闸。整个水闸一共需要安装六十三扇闸门，每一扇闸门就有十公尺那么宽，而且全部用电力来开关。这座大水闸建成以后，闸门一关，就可以把从淮河上游及中游流下来的河水储蓄在洪泽湖里面；接着就要从这里沿着淮河下游的宝应湖、高邮湖开凿一条入江水道，把整个宝应湖及高邮湖那一片茫茫的湖水通通流干，然后用水闸的闸门的开关来控制入江水道的一定的流量，使淮河驯服地流入长江。储蓄在洪泽湖里面的一湖大水就可以源源不断地沿着它的东边的灌溉总渠以及东南边的入江水道，供给整个江苏北部的灌溉和航运的水量。真是多么神奇啊！你只要想想：将水闸的电门打开，让闸门自动地一开关，一个湖一个湖的水就能通通倒干；干旱的地方从此再也不缺水了；不能行船的地方能行船了；眼看着一天比一天干了的洪泽湖就要满起来，叫它重新来换一次水。等到把从淮河上流下来的水都储蓄在洪泽湖里面，从淮河里来的鱼也都集中在洪泽湖里安起家来，这样，洪泽湖不仅变成了一个大水库，而且就要变成一个大鱼库了。不过，朱艮宣老头子说，他们正在发愁着一件事情：等到水闸建成以后，把整个洪泽湖的水储满，湖面宽了，湖上的风浪大了，只有大帆船和汽船能够在湖面上航行，像他们现在这样的小木船就不能到湖上去了。但是，只再想想，也实在用不着发愁。我们打败了无数凶恶的敌人，有办法把一个洪泽湖的湖水都换过了，难道还没有办法来把我们的小木船换一换么？
    〔注〕过去封建阶级在湖上霸占着一块一块的湖面，渔民到那里去撒网打鱼，要向他们缴纳很重的租税，封建统治者把他们所霸占的湖面叫做“网地”。
