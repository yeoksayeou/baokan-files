    Reader Letters Processing Situation in the Last Two Weeks

    From May 24th to June 7th, the People's Daily Reader Letters Group received a total of 3,296 reader letters and 819 responses from various agencies to readers' letters. Among them, 1,409 were related to political and legal issues, 1,118 were related to cultural and educational issues, 1,566 were related to industrial, agricultural production and financial issues, and 22 were of other nature. In addition, there were 661 letters from family members of revolutionary soldiers seeking revolutionary soldiers, which were not included in the statistics. 73 letters were published in this newspaper, 802 letters received individual replies from readers, 1,676 letters were transferred to relevant agencies for investigation, processing, reply, or reference, and 1,328 letters were retained by this newspaper for reference and did not require further processing. Some of the processed letters were left over from the past. During the same period, the People's Daily Reader Letters Group sent out 3,831 replies to readers, letters transferring requests to various agencies for investigation and processing, and follow-up letters.
    In these two weeks, some readers' letters reflected the new style and new atmosphere that emerged in some agencies after the struggle against bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of law and discipline. We will select and publish some of these letters, and we hope that comrades working in agencies, departments, factories, mines, and enterprises in various places will continue to reflect the situation and problems in this regard.
    Among the letters related to industrial, mining, and railway enterprises, readers reflected the low quality of coal production, which affected industrial production; reflected the situation of long-term employment and illegal dismissal of temporary workers by certain railway departments and state-owned enterprises; also reflected the situation that construction workers' wages were too high or too low without a certain standard; in addition, they also reflected the occurrence of traffic accidents on some railways and highways. We will select some of these letters for publication, and the rest will be transferred to relevant units for processing.
    Among the letters related to rural work, readers reflected problems in crop pest and disease prevention and control, drought and flood prevention, production and disaster relief, and production leadership. Some of these letters have been transferred to relevant departments for processing, and some with clear explanations are prepared for publication.
    Regarding letters concerning cultural and educational work, readers reflected the lack of a fixed plan for teaching work in some colleges and universities, the frequent occurrence of repeated courses and retakes, and the disconnection between classroom teaching and experiments; reflected the chaotic phenomena caused by weak leadership, undemocratic leadership style, and failure to do a good job in school and college adjustments; also reflected the problems of leaders' lack of concern or heavy workload, and the impact on the health of teachers and students due to poor equipment and sanitary conditions in schools at all levels. Some of these letters have been transferred to the leading organs of cultural and educational departments for processing or reference, some are prepared for further investigation and research and supplementary materials, and some will be gradually sorted out and published. Regarding letters reflecting the ideological situation of graduating students in this period and making suggestions for enrollment work in the next semester, some have been transferred to relevant leading organs for reference, and some are under our study. Some readers' letters inquired and suggested the establishment of correspondence schools and night universities. According to our understanding, the Central Higher Education Department is currently drafting a plan for setting them up and preparing to conduct key pilot projects after the summer vacation.
    During this period, we successively received letters from the vast number of readers protesting the murder of the Rosenbergs by American imperialism, some of which we have comprehensively published. In addition, we also received criticism letters from volunteer soldiers regarding the misdelivery of condolence letters, which have been transferred to the General Association to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea for inspection and processing.
