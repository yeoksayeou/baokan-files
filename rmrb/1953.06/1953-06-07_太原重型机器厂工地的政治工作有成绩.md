Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 5th. The Political Department for Basic Construction at the Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Plant supported the bricklayer Zheng Changyi and others in experimenting with model bricklaying methods, which greatly improved bricklaying efficiency and completed the project ahead of schedule. This fully demonstrates that political work is an important guarantee for the completion of basic construction tasks.

Model bricklaying is an advanced Soviet operating method. Zheng Changyi, Cao Wang, technician Liu Yulu, carpenter Ma Hanqing, and others at the Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Plant construction site studied this method, and their bricklaying skills greatly improved. In mid-April of this year, they used this advanced method to build a 180-meter-long temporary dining hall. As a result, they completed the administrative department's assigned four-and-a-half-day project in three and a half days. The average bricklaying output per worker per day was 2,260 bricks, an efficiency increase of 126 percent compared to last year's highest record.

In order to ensure the success of this experiment and to promote the model bricklaying method, the Political Department for Basic Construction at the Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Plant carried out a series of tasks during this experiment.

First, it unified the thinking and understanding of the leading cadres. When the model bricklaying method was first experimented with, it did not receive enough attention from the leading cadres. They only verbally approved of it but did not provide strong support in practice. After discovering this problem, the Political Department for Basic Construction immediately analyzed and studied it, adopting various methods to require everyone to value this advanced experience. It also convened a cadre meeting to discuss the question of "whether or not model bricklaying is valued." After heated debate, everyone clearly realized that verbal approval alone, without strong support and leadership, did not constitute true valuing. Clarifying this issue was very important. After this discussion, the leading cadres adopted active support measures for the model bricklaying experiment, providing favorable conditions for the experiment.

Next, the Political Department investigated the workers' ideological state and resolved the issue of unity between skilled and unskilled workers. A total of 66 workers participated in this experiment. Disunity existed among them. The unskilled workers said, "It is an honor for the skilled workers to experiment with advanced experiences, but it will exhaust us." The skilled workers said, "The unskilled workers can't keep up, just being enthusiastic on one end is useless." Political workers then separately educated the skilled and unskilled workers, explaining the significance of the model bricklaying method and the principle that the interests of the state and the individual interests of the working class are completely consistent. In this way, the workers' minds opened up. The skilled workers reviewed their past shortcomings in treating the unskilled workers poorly and sent Zheng Changyi as their representative to the unskilled workers' meeting to express their determination to "change their attitude and improve unity." The unskilled workers also realized that their work was not being done for others. They said, "That's right, if the country has a future, why should we worry about not having a future?" Therefore, they all expressed their willingness to listen to the guidance of the skilled workers and do a good job in the experiment. On this ideological basis, all bricklaying teams formulated plans according to the requirements of the model bricklaying method and guaranteed to complete the task ahead of schedule.

After the experiment began, political workers also organized on-site propaganda and mobilization work. They installed loudspeakers on the construction site, hung up propaganda slogans, planted nine red and green flags around the construction site, and posted work progress charts and team plans next to the construction site. This arrangement created a warm atmosphere on the construction site. Political workers used the loudspeaker to conduct propaganda and mobilization among the workers at any time according to the new problems and situations that occurred on the construction site. For example, not long after the start of construction, it was discovered that workers were only concerned with speed and not paying attention to quality. The construction site democratic management committee held a meeting that evening to study the issue, and the next day, the loudspeaker issued the slogan "Quality first, then speed, achieve both quality and speed," which quickly reversed the situation of poor quality. The loudspeaker constantly reminded workers to pay attention to safety in production, called on workers to promote the spirit of mutual assistance, commended workers with outstanding achievements, and introduced their working methods. Because political work was connected to the problems occurring on the scene at all times, the workers' morale was very high, so the experiment proceeded smoothly and completed the planned task one day ahead of schedule.

After the experiment, political workers organized the workers to conduct a summary. The summary included checking the implementation of team plans, individual guarantee conditions, joint contracts, and collective agreements, as well as each person's gains in ideology and technology. During the summary, the workers launched criticism and self-criticism, which further improved their ideological awareness. The workers are also preparing to form a technical research group, and everyone is confident that they will continue to improve on the basis of the success of this experiment.

    太原重型机器厂工地的政治工作有成绩
    【新华社太原五日电】太原重型机器厂基本建设政治处支持瓦工郑长义等试验模型砌砖法，使得砌砖效率大大提高，并且提前完成了工程任务。这件事充分说明政治工作是完成基本建设任务的重要保证。
    模型砌砖是苏联先进的操作方法。太原重型机器厂建筑工地瓦工郑长义、曹旺、技术员刘玉律、木工马汉卿等学习了这个方法，砌砖技术有很大的提高。今年四月中旬，他们试用这一先进操作法建造一座一百八十公尺长的临时饭厅，结果以三天半时间完成了行政方面所指定的四天半的工程，平均每个大工每天砌砖二千二百六十块，砌砖效率比去年最高纪录提高了百分之一百二十六。
    太原重型机器厂基本建设政治处为了保证这次试验的成功，从而使模型砌砖法能够得到推广，曾在这次试验中进行了一系列的工作。
    首先，统一了领导干部的思想和认识。模型砌砖法开始试验时，并没有得到领导干部的足够重视。他们只在口头上赞成，实际上并未给予有力的支持。基本建设政治处发现这个问题后，立即进行了分析和研究，采取了各种办法，要求大家重视这一先进经验，并召开了干部会议，讨论“对模型砌砖法是否重视”的问题。经过热烈的争论以后，大家明确地认识到只有口头上的赞成，而缺乏有力的支持和领导，并不能算作真正重视。把这个问题明确起来非常重要。经过这次讨论以后，领导干部对模型砌砖法的试验采取了积极支持的措施，为这次试验提供了便利条件。
    接着，政治处又调查了工人的思想情况，解决了大工和小工之间的团结问题。参加这次试验的工人共有六十六人，在他们中间存在着不团结的现象，小工说：“大工试验先进经验是他们的光荣，但可要把我们累坏。”大工说：“小工配合不上，光一头热不顶事。”政治工作人员就分头向大工和小工进行教育，对他们说明模型砌砖法的意义，国家利益和工人阶级个人利益完全一致的道理。这样，工人们的思想就开朗了。大工们检讨了过去对待小工态度不好的缺点，派了郑长义为代表，到小工会议上去表示“改变态度、搞好团结”的决心；小工们也认识到自己的工作并不是为别人做的，他们说：“可不是，国家有了前途，我们还愁没有前途吗？”因此都表示要听大工的指导，做好试验。在这种思想基础上，所有瓦工小组都按模型砌砖法的要求，订出了计划，并保证提前完成任务。
    试验开始后，政治工作人员又组织了现场的宣传鼓动工作。他们在工地上安装了扩音器，悬挂了宣传标语，在工地周围插了九面红绿旗，在工地旁边贴着工作进度表、小组计划等。这种布置，使得工地里呈现出一种热烈的气氛。政治工作人员随时根据工地所发生的新问题、新情况，利用广播筒向工人进行宣传鼓动。例如开工不久，就发现工人只图快而不注意质量的问题，工地民主管理委员会当晚就开会研究，第二天在广播筒中发出“先好后快、做到又好又快”的鼓动口号，使得质量不好的情形很快地扭转过来。广播筒时刻提醒工人注意安全生产，号召工人发扬互助精神，表扬成绩优越的工人，并介绍他们的工作方法。由于政治工作每时每刻都结合着现场中所发生的问题，工人们的情绪非常饱满，因此试验进行得很顺利，提前一天完成了预定计划。
    试验结束后，政治工作人员又组织工人进行了总结。总结内容是检查小组计划、个人保证条件、联系合同和集体公约的执行情况，以及每个人在思想上、技术上的收获等。在总结中，工人们展开了批评与自我批评，因而思想觉悟更提高了一步。工人们并准备成立技术研究小组，大家都有信心在这次试验成功的基础上继续提高。
