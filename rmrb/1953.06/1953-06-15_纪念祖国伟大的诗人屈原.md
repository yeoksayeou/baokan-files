    Commemorating the Great Patriotic Poet Qu Yuan
    You Guoren

    I

    Qu Yuan was a descendant of King Wu of Chu and belonged to the same family as the King of Chu. The "Records of the Historian," "Biography of Qu Yuan," says that he was of the same surname as the Chu royal family, and he himself indicated that he was a descendant of Emperor Gaoyang. Gaoyang was Zhuanxu, traditionally regarded as the ancestor of the Chu state, so there is no doubt that Qu Yuan came from a noble family. However, there were close and distant relatives among the nobility. Although Qu Yuan was of the same family as the King of Chu, his relationship with King Huai of Chu was still distant in terms of the clan system. Moreover, the position of the nobility had already been shaken and was a class undergoing differentiation. During the reign of King Dao of Chu, when Wu Qi was in power, he abolished the distant relatives of the royal family, and the descendants of feudal lords had their titles and emoluments confiscated after three generations. From this, Qu Yuan's own position and his feudal relationship with the King of Chu can be imagined. Therefore, he himself said: "I think of the ruler with utmost loyalty, yet forgetting my humble and poor status." "Humble" and "poor" indicate that he was a declining nobleman, not a feudal lord with titles and emoluments or a descendant of a feudal lord.

    If Qu Yuan was not a close nobleman in the Chu state, then how did he attain a prominent position? Of course, old feudal relationships played a role, but mainly it was due to his own talents. Qu Yuan himself said:
    "I have innate beauty, and it is enhanced by cultivated abilities." What were these "cultivated abilities"? Specifically, it was the ability described in the "Records of the Historian," "Biography," as "broad knowledge and strong memory, clear understanding of governance and chaos, and proficiency in rhetoric." Such a talented person like Qu Yuan, in an era when states were vying for supremacy and eager to recruit virtuous scholars, and when he encountered King Huai of Chu, who in his early years was a promising ruler, it was only natural that he would be promoted to the high position of Left Minister. However, the old forces at that time were still considerable, and the bad influences left over from the aristocratic regime had not been completely eliminated. The fate of Wu Qi illustrates this fact. Therefore, in that era of intense struggle between new and old ideas, Qu Yuan's assumption of important positions, and "entering to discuss state affairs with the king and issue decrees; going out to meet guests and respond to the feudal lords," was a very displeasing thing in the eyes of the nobles closely related to the King of Chu. But King Huai insisted on trusting Qu Yuan and asked him to draft constitutional decrees. Constitutional decrees were national laws that everyone had to abide by, which was very inconvenient for the nobles. This matter was very similar to Zichan casting penal laws for the state of Zheng.
    (See "Zuo Zhuan," Sixth Year of Duke Zhao) Zichan's measure was opposed even by Uncle Xiang, a nobleman of the state of Jin, who wrote a letter to责备 him, not to mention the nobles of the state of Zheng. I think that Qu Yuan's being ordered to make constitutional decrees must have aroused the dissatisfaction of a group of nobles close to King Huai, so the Senior Official wanted to take them from Qu Yuan to see if there were any clauses unfavorable to them. The draft was not yet completed, and it was an unpublished document, so it should of course be kept secret, so Qu Yuan had reason to refuse his request. In this way, he not only offended the Senior Official, but also inevitably aroused the suspicion of the close relatives around King Huai, and then the struggle began. Just then, Zhang Yi of the state of Qin came to Chu to conduct activities, attempting to break up the alliance between the states of Qi and Chu. Qu Yuan had always advocated alliance with Qi to resist Qin in diplomacy, so the group of close relatives took the opportunity to spread rumors and alienate him from King Huai. When King Huai was slandered and really did not believe him, they further excluded him, and the result was exile. Looking at Qu Yuan's repeated calling them "clique members," it can be seen how deliberately they colluded with each other to form a group to deal with Qu Yuan, attack Qu Yuan, and persecute Qu Yuan. When Qu Yuan failed in political struggle and was exiled, he repeatedly recalled that King Huai was surrounded and unable to promote the worthy, resulting in the defeat of the imperial chariot. The "Li Sao" especially emphasizes this point. For example, it says:
    "Xia Jie was always disobedient,
    And then he met with disaster;
    Hou Xin was pickled and minced,
    So the Yin dynasty did not last long.
    Tang and Yu were solemn and respectful,
    The Zhou dynasty discussed the Tao without error,
    Promoting the worthy and entrusting the able,
    Following the line and ink without deviation."
    The reason why he had to state these historical facts was to explain why the monarchs of the three dynasties rose and fell, and the main reason was whether they could employ the worthy and able. Yu used Gao Yao, Tang used Yi Yin, and King Wen and King Wu of Zhou employed Lü Shang, so they prospered the country; Xia Jie killed Guan Longpang, and Shang Zhou killed Bigan, so they perished the country. Therefore, his conclusion is to "promote the worthy and entrust the able, following the line and ink without deviation." The worthy and able refers to Qu Yuan himself, and the line and ink refers to the laws of the country, which may refer to the constitutional decrees he was ordered to draft. What does this reflect? Obviously, on the one hand, it reflects Qu Yuan's opposition to aristocratic politics, and on the other hand, it reflects Qu Yuan's regret that King Huai could not adhere to virtuous politics. Since it was still aristocratic politics, then only a few privileged figures could do whatever they wanted, only they could "deviate from the rules and correct mistakes" ("Li Sao"), only they could "violate the law and govern with their hearts" ("Xiwangri"). The key to the rise and fall of the Chu state lay here, and Qu Yuan's personal success and failure in politics also lay here. So he repeated in the back of "Li Sao":
    "Tang and Yu were strict and sought harmony,
    Embracing Gao Yao and being able to adjust...
    Yue wielded a trowel at Fuyan,
    Wu Ding used him without doubt;
    Lü Wang drummed a knife,
    Met King Wen of Zhou and was promoted;
    Ning Qi sang songs,
    Duke Huan of Qi heard and used him as an assistant." Legend has it that a criminal筑于 Fuyan, and Emperor Gaozong of Yin employed him; Lü Wang was a butcher who sold meat in Chaoge, and King Wen of Zhou employed him; Ning Qi was a merchant who personally fed cattle under his chariot, and Duke Huan of Qi employed him. These three typical examples illustrate the effect of virtuous politics. Qu Yuan repeatedly raised them (and "Xiwangri" also mentioned Bailixi, Yi Yin, Lü Wang, Ning Qi, etc.), which is enough to show that he did not rise to power solely based on his noble status, so he emphasized the advocacy of virtuous politics.
    Qu Yuan often compared the worthy to fragrant herbs. When he was Left Minister, he cultivated many talents to help him achieve something; so he said: "I have cultivated nine acres of orchids, and planted a hundred acres of fragrant herbs, separated Ligusticum sinense and Eupatorium fortunei, mixed Asarum heterotropoides and Angelica dahurica. Hoping that the branches and leaves will be luxuriant, I wish to wait for the time when I will harvest." Later, these people could not adhere to justice, and when they saw Qu Yuan lose power, they all changed their minds; so he said very painfully:
    "Even if they wither and die, what harm is there? I grieve for the weeds and filth of the fragrant herbs!" When he considered the issue of leaving the country, he solemnly said: "The times are varied and changeable, so how can I stay? The orchids change and are no longer fragrant, and the fragrant herbs turn into weeds. Why were they fragrant herbs in the past, but now they have become Artemisia selengensis! Is there any other reason? It is the harm of not liking cultivation!" (Above from "Li Sao") It can be seen that Qu Yuan usually cared most about the cultivation of talents, and naturally hated their degeneration the most; because he valued virtuous politics, what good would people with talent but no virtue, who only sought profit, do for the people and the motherland? This was the reason why he felt the most sad, the most disappointed, and had to "follow the auspicious divination of Ling Fen," although this idea was only a reflection of temporary contradictions.

    Qu Yuan had his political ideals. What were these ideals? That was to achieve the prosperity of the Tang, Yu, and Three Dynasties through virtuous politics. This was originally the ideal politics of the Confucian school since the Spring and Autumn period, which, in the words of the poet Du Fu, was to "make the ruler like Yao and Shun, and make the customs pure again." He believed that in the prosperous times of Tang and Yu, the rulers were wise and the ministers were good, and there were many talents. Boyi, Yu, and Ji assisted in governance, so he said: "In the past, the three monarchs were pure and sincere, so they were the place where many fragrant herbs gathered; they mixed Zanthoxylum bungeanum and Cinnamomum cassia, and not only sewed Angelica dahurica and Lysimachia foenum-graecum? Yao and Shun were upright and honest, so they followed the Tao and found the way; why were Jie and Zhou rampant, only taking shortcuts to be in trouble!" Why did Yao and Shun find the way, and why were Jie and Zhou in trouble? The problem is very simple, it only lies in whether they can employ the worthy and able. Therefore, he recalled his efforts to assist King Huai of Chu in administration and said: "Running around back and forth, I followed the footsteps of the previous kings." (Above from "Li Sao") Following the footsteps of the previous kings was Qu Yuan's ultimate political goal and his highest political ideal.

    II

    Due to Qu Yuan's class origin as a declining nobleman, and his long exile and wandering, he had the opportunity to contact the people; and due to the influence of the great era of the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods, his ideology was more or less inclined to the people. This determined that Qu Yuan's vision was relatively broad, not only wanting to get close to the King of Chu as much as possible, but also caring about the people of the Chu state. Therefore, his literary works fully reflected the nature of the people. This full expression of the nature of the people constituted an important part of the realism of Qu Yuan's literature. For example, "Li Sao" says:
    "I sigh deeply and wipe away my tears,
    Grieving for the hardships of the people's lives!"
    It also says: "I resent Ling Xiu's recklessness, and never understanding the hearts of the people."
    It also says: "Heaven has no private favoritism, but chooses assistants based on the virtue of the people...
    Looking forward and looking back,
    Observing the limits of the people's plans."
    "Chousi" also says: "I wish to shake up and run rampant, observing the people's resentments to calm myself." The "people" mentioned above, such as "people's lives," "people's hearts," "people's virtues," and "people's resentments," sometimes refer to the general people, and sometimes even include Qu Yuan himself. Why did he never forget the people? Precisely because he loved the people and sympathized with the people. His measures in internal affairs were "to illuminate the lower with the achievements of the predecessors, and to clarify the ambiguities of the laws" ("Xiwangri"). His advocacy in diplomacy was to unite with the state of Qi to resist the Qin, which was like a tiger and wolf. Clarifying the laws and resisting strong enemies was beneficial to the people. Conversely, "violating the law and governing with the heart," allowing the rulers to violate laws and regulations and do whatever they wanted; or watching the approach of strong enemies, being helpless, only considering personal interests, and blindly compromising and surrendering, was of course harmful to the people. Therefore, Qu Yuan's interests became the interests of the people, and Qu Yuan's likes and dislikes became the likes and dislikes of the people. Basically, he was consistent with the wishes and feelings of the people. Because if the Chu state's dignitaries were allowed to mess around and ruin the country, and let the enemies succeed, it would certainly be unfavorable to Qu Yuan himself; would it be of any benefit to the people? Obviously, it would be of no benefit. This is the unity of personal interests and the interests of the people. The performance in Qu Yuan's entire poem is quite able to represent the feelings of the people, reflect the demands of the people, and meet the wishes of the people. This is the basic characteristic of his literary works.

    Qu Yuan's literary works also fully express his love for the motherland. He loved the homeland of the motherland, loved the mountains and rivers of the motherland, loved the customs and folklore of the motherland, and loved every plant and tree of the motherland, teaching people to have a special sense of intimacy with the motherland and unconsciously generate a love for the motherland. He felt heartache as soon as he left the capital, and never forgot to return for a moment. The further he went, the sadder he became. For example, the "Ai Ying" expresses this feeling most prominently:
    "Leaving my homeland to go far away,
    Following the Yangtze and Xia rivers into exile. Leaving the country gate, my heart is filled with sorrow,
    I set off at dawn. Looking at the long catalpas, I sigh deeply,
    My tears fall like snowflakes. Passing through Xiashou and floating westward,
    I look at Longmen but cannot see it! My soul wants to return,
    How can I forget to return for a moment? Leaving Xia Pu and thinking westward,
    I grieve for my distant hometown!" On the way of exile, he was very depressed, often comforting himself with the scenery of mountains and rivers and local customs to seek temporary pleasure, for example, "Ai Ying" says:
    "Climbing the big tomb to look far away,
    Just to relieve my worries." As in "Si Meiren" says:
    "Spring begins and the year starts,
    The sun comes out slowly.
    I will let my mind wander and enjoy myself,
    Following the Yangtze and Xia rivers to entertain my sorrows.
    Picking the fragrant Lysimachia foenum-graecum,
    Pulling up the old weeds of Changzhou.
    I regret that I cannot reach the ancients,
    Who can I play with these fragrant herbs? ...
    I will wander around to entertain my sorrows,
    Observing the changes of the southern people.
    I secretly feel happy in my heart,
    Raising my confidence without hesitation." However, this was only temporary. In fact, he missed the motherland all the time on the road, especially when the seasons and climate changed, he was very sad ("Chousi": "My heart is full of worries, I sigh alone and increase my sorrow. Thinking of the difficulties that cannot be released, I encounter the long night. Grieving for the movement of the autumn wind, why is it so drifting! Counting only Sun's many angers, hurting my heart with worry!"). He often couldn't sleep at night, and even if he fell asleep, he dreamed several times a night, returning to Yingdu in his dreams ("Looking at the short night of early summer, why is it as long as a year? Only Yinglu's road is far away, my soul leaves nine times in one night: I don't even know the twists and turns of the road, pointing south to the moon and stars. Wishing to go straight but unable to, my soul knows the road's struggles."). Sima Qian said that "although he was exiled, he cared about the Chu state, was concerned about King Huai, and never forgot to return... In one chapter, he expressed his will three times," which can be called a very concise and correct summary.

    Because Qu Yuan insisted on the correct foreign policy, he tirelessly fought with the "clique members" while bitterly persuading King Huai, hoping to reverse the decline and turn danger into safety. Personal interests were not taken into account. So he said: "Only the clique members steal joy, the road is dark and dangerous. How can I fear disasters? I fear the defeat of the imperial chariot." - "Li Sao" The pro-Qin views of the "clique members" led the King of Chu to a dark and dangerous path, which was really frightening. But he was not afraid of suffering any disasters himself, but afraid that the motherland would perish. When the struggle failed and he went from being alienated to being exiled, he was still so selfless, only blaming King Huai for changing his mind repeatedly and being indecisive, making state affairs unmanageable. So he also said:
    "At first, you and I made an agreement,
    But later you regretted and changed your mind.
    I don't find it difficult to leave,
    But I grieve for Ling Xiu's many changes." - "Li Sao" Not only that, but he repeatedly expressed his strong and unyielding spirit, never compromising. For example, he said: "I want to change my ways and follow the customs, but I am ashamed to change my original intention and bend my will." ("Si Meiren") He also said: "I cannot change my mind and follow the customs, so I will be sad and poor to the end." ("She Jiang") He also said: "I would rather die suddenly and be exiled than endure such a state!" Even saying: "It is also what my heart likes, even if I die nine times, I will not regret it!" And saying: "Even if my body is dismembered, I will not change, how can my heart be punished?" (Above "Li Sao") Why was Qu Yuan so tenacious? Because he refused to harm the country for personal interests. He believed that if the imperial chariot was defeated, he would have no personal interests to speak of. He deeply realized that personal interests were included in the interests of the country. In this way, he unified personal interests and national interests. Therefore, in his long exile, he always missed the motherland and did not forget Yingdu ("Ai Ying": "I don't even know that Xia is a hill, how can the two east gates be desolate?"). He always wanted to return to the embrace of the motherland, even if he died, he wanted to go back ("Ai Ying": "Birds fly back to their homeland, and foxes must turn their heads to the hills when they die."). For a period of time, although he conceived of leaving the country, he finally did not want to leave when he saw his "old hometown," and finally only died. This sincere and pure emotion permeated his every poem, which is of course another basic characteristic of his literary works.

    Now let's specifically analyze various aspects of Qu Yuan's literature.

    First, it adopts and develops the forms of folk literature. This form is mainly manifested in the use of a "xi" character universally in or at the end of sentences. According to Qing Dynasty phonologists, the ancient sound of this "xi" character was read as "a," the same as our modern colloquial word. Later generations called this literary style "Sao" style, but the so-called "Sao" style was not created by Qu Yuan. The "Book of Songs" and ancient southern folk songs already had it. Qu Yuan only used it. Secondly, it is manifested in the varying lengths of sentences: he not only broke the square four-character poem form of the past, but also the forms of each poem are not exactly the same, and even the front and back of one poem are different. For example, "Li Sao," "Huai Sha," "Ju Song," "Zhao Hun," and other poems have different forms, and the sentences in the front and back of "Huai Sha" and the beginning and end of "Zhao Hun" are also completely different. It can be seen that Qu Yuan not only adopted folk literature forms, but also constantly developed and changed them.

    Second, it extensively uses the dialects of the Chu state. Dialects are languages that live in the mouths of the people. According to what can now be verified, such words as qiang, jian, fen, ping, xiu, hu, chan, hai, xu, tan, ying, dai, fu, nu, chuan, chanyuan, and chachi have been pointed out and proven by predecessors to be ancient Chu people's spoken language. And the continuous use of one hundred and fourteen "xie" characters in "Zhao Hun" (not counting omissions and variants) also proves that it was the spoken language used by wizards in the old customs of the Chu state when performing incantations, so it reads particularly vividly. I think it must have been more popular in the local area at that time.

    Third, it extensively absorbs myths and legends. Myths and legends are folk oral creations. Qu Yuan's works have absorbed them extensively as literary materials. For example, (1) Nüqi gave birth to nine sons without a husband. (2) Gonggong fought with Zhuanxu and was defeated, his head touched Buzhou Mountain, breaking the sky pillar and severing the earth's axis, causing the sky to tilt to the northwest and the earth to sink to the southeast. (3) Gun died and turned into a yellow bear (three-legged turtle) and entered the Yuyuan Abyss. (4) Yu filled the floods and also asked Yinglong to draw the land with his tail to open the river. (5) Qi's mother, Tushan clan, turned into a stone and gave birth to Qi. (6) Qi stole the "Nine Changes" and "Nine Songs" music and dance of God from heaven. (7) Yi shot ten suns, shooting down nine of them.
    (8) Jian Di swallowed the egg of a swallow and gave birth to Qi. (9) Hou Ji was abandoned on the cold ice, and birds used their wings to cover him. (10) Yi Yin was born in Kongsang. The above are all found in "Tian Wen," and the myth of the black bird giving birth to Shang is also found in "Li Sao" and "Si Meiren." This makes their content richer and more vivid.

    Fourth, it depicts the local customs of the Chu state. "Nine Songs" was originally a folk song of the Chu state for worshiping gods, and Qu Yuan modified it very beautifully. The spirits and shamans were dignified, and the five tones were varied. It was like a vivid local song and dance drama was being performed in a very lively and vivid atmosphere. For example, "Li Sao" mentions the situation of divination, with the words "suo qiong mao yi shi chuan." Qiongmiao is a kind of spiritual grass, and shi chuan is a bamboo cup. Tying grass and judging bamboo and throwing them on the ground to see their upward or downward side to predict good or bad fortune was originally a folk custom of the Chu state. This custom used to be very common in various parts of the south. As for the descent of the shaman Xian in "Li Sao" and the summoning of souls by the shaman Yang in "Zhao Hun," they are all reflections of Chu folk customs.

    Fifth, it is rich in storytelling. Although "Li Sao" is a lyric poem, it has a strong sense of storytelling. At the beginning, it uses a biographical style to narrate its own lineage, ancestors, birth date, and name, and then narrates its own character, talent, aspirations, and experiences. Then, it uses the form of three major dialogues, the accusation of Nu Xu, the divination of Ling Fen, and the descent of the shaman Xian, to enrich the content of the story. After Nu Xu scolded him, he fantasized about going to Chonghua to present his case, followed by knocking on the heaven's gate to seek women. This is the most lively part of "Li Sao" and the time when storytelling develops to its highest peak. Later, Qu Yuan listened to Ling Fen's advice and left his country. He drove a flying dragon, detoured to Kunlun Mountain, set off from Tianjin, arrived at the West Pole, passed through the quicksand and red water, and finally passed Buzhou Mountain, thinking of going to the West Sea. He suddenly saw his motherland in the air and finally couldn't bear to leave. The great "Li Sao" ended like this. This style, which is full of storytelling, also comes from folk literature.

    Sixth, it is extremely rich in imagination. For example, after presenting the case to Chonghua in "Li Sao," he fantasized about knocking on the heaven's gate, riding clouds and dragons, driving the sun and moon, with Feilian and the thunder master serving him. Gusts of wind, clouds, and rainbows all came to welcome him. And when the gates of heaven did not open, he crossed the White River, climbed Langfeng, visited the Spring Palace, and sought the goddesses of the Luo River, circling around in the sky before coming down. It is really an unprecedented new idea. And "Zhao Hun" describes many terrible things in all directions, such as giants thousands of feet tall, nine-headed snakes, red ants like elephants, black bees like gourds, wolves with vertical eyes, and the earth god with nine pacts, which is even more fantasy. If we understand that Qu Yuan's literary materials mostly originated from folk myths, then it is not surprising.

    III

    Qu Yuan is a great poet of our nation who loved the motherland and loved the people.

    During the Warring States Period, many talented people, if they did not encounter opportunities in their own country, mostly ran to other countries to seek the development of their own careers. When King Huai of Chu did not trust Qu Yuan, Qu Yuan could have left, but the result of his consideration was negative. He said:
    "I want to fly high and gather far away,
    The ruler thinks what you will do?
    Wanting to run rampant and lose your way,
    But the will is firm and cannot bear it." - "Xi Song" Later, the situation got worse and worse, and even after repeated exiles, he could still leave, but he finally refused to leave. Although he had not only seriously considered this issue, but also imagined that he had already left, what happened in the end? He turned back on the way to leave the country. It can be seen that he refused to leave the motherland easily for personal reasons. Although he repeatedly considered leaving, he finally overcame it again and again. What a determined will. Therefore, Qu Yuan was a conscious patriot with a high degree of enthusiasm.

    According to Qu Yuan's own account, he was very sympathetic to the people and never forgot the people. Therefore, all his measures and proposals in internal affairs and diplomacy would naturally meet the demands and wishes of the people. To give an example: the Chu state had a wise Prime Minister early on named Ziwu. In order to uphold the dignity of the state's laws, he did not shield his law-breaking clan members and was praised by the people, and the song said he was "upright and fair." The constitutional decrees drafted by Qu Yuan were fair and reasonable, and would of course be welcomed by the people, but precisely because of this, the privileged figures of the nobility would feel inconvenient and would express their opposition, and therefore would try every means to exclude him and frame him. For example, Qu Yuan advocated resisting Qin and opposing pro-Qin, and this view was also consistent with the people of the Chu state at that time. Therefore, later, when King Huai entered Qin and did not return, the people were very heartbroken, and there was even a proverb about three households destroying Qin. Decades later, it was the people of all classes in the Chu state who took up hoes and launched a revolution to overthrow the rule of the Qin state. Those who participated in this anti-Qin movement, as far as can be verified now, there were more than 30 people from Chu alone, including poor tenant farmers, small businessmen, low-level officials, local gentry, and also declining nobles. They all called for the restoration of the Chu state. Could this be an accidental event? It can be imagined that Qu Yuan's literature and ideological actions played a certain role.

    Secondly, Qu Yuan's literature had a great influence on the history of Chinese literature. Qu Yuan's literature has rich life content, very strong realism, and very strong combativeness; it also has a rich sense of the people, a large amount of folk literature materials, and popular folk literature forms that are loved by the people. Therefore, its nature of the people is particularly strong. Chinese literature has always been referred to as "Feng" and "Sao," "Feng" is "Guo Feng," representing "Book of Songs," and "Sao" is "Li Sao," representing "Chu Ci." They are basically the same in the above aspects. Since Qu Yuan left behind many great works, for more than two thousand years, how many literati have not loved them and have not been influenced by them. They constantly imitated its style and style, especially his ideas and passion for loving the motherland and loving the people. Many poets have received a very profound education, such as Du Fu, Bai Juyi, and Lu You, who all admired him and worshiped him very much.

    Such a great poet as Qu Yuan is worthy of our national people's eternal respect and commemoration. We are proud that our motherland has such a great poet.

    纪念祖国伟大的诗人屈原
    游国恩
    一
    屈原是楚武王的后代，同楚王是本家。“史记”“屈原传”说他是楚的同姓，他自己也表明他是帝高阳的苗裔。高阳即颛顼，相传是楚国的祖先，所以屈原是出身于贵族是没有问题的。不过贵族也有亲有疏，屈原虽然与楚王是一家，但在宗法上来说，他同楚怀王的关系还是很疏远的。何况当时贵族地位早已动摇，已经是一种分化着的阶级。楚悼王时，吴起当政，曾经废除公族的疏远者，封君的子孙过了三代就没收他们的爵禄，这样看来，屈原本身的地位和他与楚王的封建关系也就可想而知了。所以他自己说：“思君其莫我忠兮，忽忘身之贱贫。”“贱”和“贫”就说明他是一个没落的贵族，而不是什么拥有爵禄的封君或者封君的子孙了。
    屈原在楚国既不是一个亲近的贵族，那么他又靠着什么获致了显要的地位呢？当然封建的旧关系也是有的，但主要的还是凭他自己的才能。屈原自己说过：
    “纷吾既有此内美兮，又重之以修能。”什么“修能”呢？具体地说，就是“史记”本传所谓“博闻强志，明于治乱，娴于辞令”的本事。像屈原这样一个人材，在那列国争雄，急于延揽贤士的时代，又遇到楚怀王早年正是颇有作为的国君，他会被提拔到职位很高的左徒，那是极其自然的事。可是那时的旧势力仍然不小，贵族政权下所遗留的坏影响并未完全消灭，吴起的结果便说明这
    一事实。因此在那新旧思想激烈斗争的时代，屈原的出任要职，而且“入则与王图议国事，以出号令；出则接遇宾客，应对诸侯”，在与楚王嫡亲的贵族们看来，又是一件非常不顺眼的事。无奈怀王却偏偏信任屈原，叫他草拟宪令。——宪令是国家的法令，大家都要遵守的，对于贵族显要是很不方便的。这一件事和子产为郑国铸刑书极相类似。
    （见昭公六年左传）子产这一措施连晋国的贵族叔向也反对，至于写信责备他，郑国的贵族自然更不消说。我想，屈原奉命制作宪令，必然会引起一班与怀王亲近的贵族们的不满，所以上官大夫打听了这个消息，就想从屈原手里拿过来，看看有什么不利于他们的条款。宪稿还未完成，又是没有公布的文件，当然应该保密，所以屈原就有理由拒绝他的要求。这样，就不但得罪了上官大夫，而且必然会招致怀王左右亲贵的疑忌，于是乎斗争便开始了。恰巧这时秦国的张仪到楚国来活动，企图拆散齐楚两国的联合。屈原在外交上本是主张联齐抗秦的，因此那班亲贵们就乘机造谣，离间他同怀王之间的感情，等到怀王中了谗言，真的不相信他的时候，便进一步排挤他，那结果便是放逐。试看屈原屡次称他们为“党人”，可见他们是如何处心积虑，互相勾结，组成一个集团来对付屈原，打击屈原，迫害屈原。当屈原在政治上斗争失败，被放逐在外的时候，他一再追述到怀王受包围，不能举贤任能，以致皇舆败绩。“离骚”一篇就特别着重这一点。例如说：
    “夏桀之常违兮，
    乃遂焉而逢殃；
    后辛之菹醢兮，
    殷宗用而不长。
    汤禹俨而只敬兮，
    周论道而莫差，
    举贤而授能兮，
    循绳墨而不颇。”
    他所以必须要陈述这些历史的事实，就是要说明三代之君为什么兴，为什么亡，其主要原因在于能否任用贤能。禹用咎徭，汤用伊尹，周文王、武王任用吕尚，所以兴国；夏桀杀关龙逄，商纣杀比干，所以亡国。因此他的结论是要“举贤而授能，循绳墨而不颇”。贤能是屈原指自己，绳墨指国家的法度，可能就是指他奉命所草拟的宪令。这反映什么呢？显然的一方面反映屈原反对贵族政治，一方面又反映屈原痛惜怀王不能坚持贤能政治。既然还是贵族政治，那就只有少数的几个特权人物为所欲为，只有由他们去“偭规矩而改错”（“离骚”），只有让他们“背法度而心治”（“惜往日”）了。楚国兴亡的关键在此，屈原个人在政治上的成功与失败也在此。所以他又在“离骚”后面重复地说：
    “汤禹严而求合兮，
    挚咎徭而能调。……
    说操筑于傅岩兮，
    武丁用而不疑；
    吕望之鼓刀兮，
    遭周文而得举；
    寗戚之讴歌兮，
    齐桓闻以该辅。”传说是一个有罪的人，筑于傅岩，殷高宗举用他；吕望是一个屠夫，卖肉于朝歌，周文王举用他；寗戚是一个商人，亲自饭牛于车下，齐桓公举用他。这三个典型的事例就说明贤能政治的效果。屈原一再地提出来，（“惜往日”也提到百里奚、伊尹、吕望、寗戚等人。）更足以说明他并不是单靠贵族的身分关系上台，所以才强调主张贤能政治。
    屈原常常把贤能的人比作芳草。当他为左徒时，曾经培植不少的人材来帮助自己做一番事业；所以说：“余既滋兰之九畹兮，又树蕙之百亩，畦留夷与揭车兮，杂杜衡与芳芷。冀枝叶之峻茂兮，愿俟时乎吾将刈。”后来这批人不能坚持正义，看见屈原失势，一个个都变了节；所以他就很痛心地说：
    “虽萎绝其亦何伤兮，哀众芳之芜秽！”及至他考虑到去国的问题时还郑重地说：“时缤纷其变易兮，又何可以淹留？兰芷变而不芳兮，荃蕙化而为茅。何昔日之芳草兮，今直为此萧艾也！岂其有他故兮？莫好修之害也！”（以上“离骚”）可见屈原平素最关心人材的培养，自然也最痛恨他们的堕落；因为他注重贤能政治，有才无德，唯利是图的人，对人民对祖国还有什么好处呢？这是他最感到悲痛、感到失望，而不得不“从灵氛之吉占”的原因了，虽然这种想法不过是暂时的矛盾心理的反映。
    屈原是有他的政治理想的。什么理想呢？那就是通过贤能政治以达到唐虞三代之盛。这本是春秋以来儒家的理想政治，用诗人杜甫的话来说，那就是“致君尧舜上，再使风俗淳”。他认为唐虞盛世，君明臣良，人材众多，伯夷、禹、稷相助为理，所以说：“昔三后之纯粹兮，固众芳之所在；杂申椒与菌桂兮，岂惟纫夫蕙茝？彼尧舜之耿介兮，既遵道而得路；何桀纣之猖披兮，夫唯捷径以窘步！”尧舜为什么得路，桀纣又为什么窘步呢？问题很简单，那就只在乎能不能任用贤能而已。所以他追述自己努力协助楚怀王行政的事说：“忽奔走以先后兮，及前王之踵武。”（以上“离骚”）前王的踵武是屈原的最后的政治目的，也是他最高的政治理想。
    二
    由于屈原的阶级出身是一个没落的贵族，以及他的长期放逐长期流浪的缘故，使他有机会接触人民；又由于春秋战国间这个大时代的影响，使他的思想意识就或多或少地倾向于人民。这样就决定了屈原的眼光就比较远大，不但想极力靠拢楚王，而且也关怀楚国的人民。所以反映在他的文学作品上就有了充分的人民性。这种充分的人民性就构成了屈原文学的现实主义的重要部分。例如“离骚”说：
    “长太息以掩涕兮，
       哀民生之多艰！”
    又说：“怨灵修之浩荡兮，终不察夫民心。”
    又说：“皇天无私阿兮，览民德焉错辅。……
    瞻前而顾后兮，
    相观民之计极。”
    “抽思”又说：“愿摇起而横奔兮，览民尤以自镇。”以上所说的“民生”、“民心”、“民德”、“民尤”的那些“民”字，有的是指一般人民，有的连屈原自己也包括在内。他为什么念念不忘人民呢？正因为他是热爱人民同情人民的。他在内政上的措施是“奉先功以照下兮，明法度之嫌疑”（“惜往日”）他在外交上的主张是联合齐国，以抗虎狼之秦。修明法度，抵抗强敌，对人民是有利的。反过来说，“背法度而心治”，听任统治者违法乱纪，为所欲为；或者眼看强敌进逼，束手无策，只从个人利益打算，一味妥协投降，这当然是于人民有害的。所以屈原的利害就会成为人民的利害，屈原的好恶就会成为人民的好恶。在基本上他同人民的愿望和感情是一致的。因为如果听凭楚国的权贵们胡闹，把国家搞坏，让敌人得志，对屈原自己固然不利；对人民来说，有没有好处呢？显然是没有好处的。这就是个人利益和人民利益的统一。在屈原整个诗篇中的表现，就相当地能够代表人民的感情，反映人民的要求，符合人民的愿望，这是他的文学作品的基本特点。
    屈原的文学作品又充分地表现了热爱祖国的情绪。他热爱祖国的乡土，热爱祖国的山川，热爱祖国的风土人情，热爱祖国的一草一木，教人们读了对祖国有特别亲切之感，不觉悠然生其爱恋祖国之心。他一离开国都就痛心，没有一刻会忘记了回来，他走得越远就越难过。例如“哀郢”一篇，这种心情就表现得最为突出：
    “去故乡而就远兮，
  遵江夏以流亡。出国门而轸怀兮，
  甲之鼌吾以行。……望长楸而太息兮，
  涕淫淫其若霰。过夏首而西浮兮，
  顾龙门而不见！羌灵魂之欲归兮，
  何须臾而忘反？背夏浦而西思兮，
  哀故都之日远！”他在放逐途中，非常苦闷，常常借着山川景物，风土人情来安慰自己，以求得暂时的快乐，例如“哀郢”说：
    “登大坟以远望兮，
    聊以舒吾忧心。”又如“思美人”说：
    “开春发岁兮，
    白日出之悠悠。
    吾将荡志而愉乐兮，
    遵江夏以娱忧。
    擥大薄之芳茝兮，
    搴长洲之宿莽。
    惜吾不及古人兮，
    吾谁与玩此芳草？……
    吾且儃佪以娱忧兮，
    观南人之变态。
    窃快在中心兮，
    扬厥凭而不俟。”然而这只是暂时的，其实他在道路之间，无时不怀念祖国，特别是季节和气候变化的时候就非常难过，（“抽思”：“心郁郁之忧思兮，独永叹乎增伤。思蹇产之不释兮，曼遭夜之方长。悲秋风之动容兮，何回极之浮浮！数惟荪之多怒兮，伤余心之忧忧！”）常常夜里睡不着觉，即使睡着了，一夜做上好几次梦，在梦里回到了郢都。（“望孟夏之短夜兮，何晦明之若岁。惟郢路之辽远兮，魂一夕而九逝：曾不知路之曲直兮，南指月与列星。愿径逝而未得兮，魂识路之营营。”）司马迁说他“虽放流，眷顾楚国，系心怀王，不忘欲反。……一篇之中，三致志焉”，可谓一个极其扼要和正确的概括。
    由于屈原坚持正确的外交政策，他一面苦谏怀王，一面同“党人”们作不疲倦的斗争，希望能够挽回颓势，转危为安。个人利害在所不计。所以说：“惟夫党人之偷乐兮，路幽昧以险隘。岂余身之惮殃兮？恐皇舆之败绩。”——“离骚”“党人”们的亲秦的主张把楚王引到黑暗危险的道路上去，这真教人害怕。可是他并不是怕自己遭受任何祸殃，而是怕祖国将会覆亡。及至斗争失败，由见疏而见放，他还是那样不顾自己，只怪怀王三反四复，举棋不定，弄得国事不可收拾。所以又说：
    “初既与余成言兮，
    后悔遁而有他。
    余既不难夫离别兮，
    伤灵修之数化。”——“离骚”不但如此，而且一再表示坚强不屈，绝不妥协的精神。例如他说：“欲变节以从俗兮，愧易初而屈志。”（“思美人”）又说：“吾不能变心而从俗兮，固将愁苦而终穷。”（“涉江”）又说：“宁溘死以流亡兮，吾不忍为此态也！”甚至说：“亦余心之所善兮，虽九死其犹未悔！”又说：“虽体解吾犹未变兮，岂余心之可惩？”（以上“离骚”）屈原为什么这样顽强呢？就因为不肯为了个人利益而危害国家。他认为如果皇舆败绩，他个人没有利益可言。他深深认识到：个人利益即包括在国家利益之中。这样，他就把个人利益和国家利益统一起来。所以他在长期放逐之中总是想念祖国，不忘郢都。（“哀郢”：“曾不知夏之为丘兮，孰两东门之可芜？”）总是想回到祖国的怀抱，死也要回去。（“哀郢”：“鸟飞反故乡兮，狐死必首丘。”）在一个时期中，他虽然设想到去国，而终因看见“旧乡”，宁死也不肯走，最后只有一死而已。这种真挚纯洁的感情就贯彻洋溢着在他的每一首诗篇里面，这当然又是他的文学作品的一个基本特点。
    现在再来具体分析屈原文学的各方面。
    第一是采用民间文学的形式并加以发展。这种形式主要表现在句中或句末普遍地用一个“兮”字。这个“兮”字据清代的音韵学者说，它的古音念
    “啊”，同我们现代的口语词一样。后人称这种文学体裁为“骚”体，其实所谓“骚”体并非屈原所创造的。“诗经”及古代的南方民歌早已有之，屈原不过是沿用而已。其次表现在句法的长短参差上：他不但打破从前那种方块式的四言诗形式，而且各篇的形式也不尽相同，甚至一篇之中前后也不同。例如“离骚”、“怀沙”、“橘颂”、“招魂”等篇固然形式各异，而“怀沙”的前后和“招魂”的首尾与中间的句法也截然不同。可见屈原不但采用了民间文学形式，而且不断地加以发展和变化。
    第二是大量采用楚国的方言。方言是活在人民口头上的语言。据现在可考的，其中如羌、蹇、纷、凭、修、扈、邅、咍、嬃、潭、瀛、軑、泭、笯、篿、婵媛、侘傺等词，已经前人指出并证明确为古代楚国人的口语。而“招魂”一篇一连串用了一百一十四个“些”字（脱简及异文不计），也证明是楚国旧俗巫师施行禁咒时的口语，所以读起来就特别生动。我想在当时当地必然会更受欢迎。
    第三是大量吸收神话和传说。神话和传说是民间的口头创作。屈原作品中曾把它们大量地吸收进来，作为文学资料。例如，（一）女岐无夫而生九子。（二）共工氏与颛顼战败，头触不周山，折天柱，绝地维，使天倾西北，地陷东南。（三）鲧死化为黄熊（三足鳖），入于羽渊。（四）禹填洪水，又使应龙以尾画地开河。（五）启母涂山氏化为石而生启。（六）启上天偷了上帝“九辩”“九歌”的乐舞。（七）羿射十个太阳，射落了九个。
    （八）简狄吞燕卵而生契。（九）后稷被弃于寒冰之上，鸟用翼来掩护他。（十）伊尹生于空桑。以上都见于“天问”，而玄鸟生商的神话又见于“离骚”及“思美人”。这就使得它们的内容更丰富更生动。
    第四是描写楚国的地方风俗。“九歌”本是楚国民间祭神的歌曲，屈原把它修改得非常美妙。其间灵巫偃蹇，五音繁会，俨然是逼真的地方歌舞戏在极热闹极生动的气氛中表演着。又如“离骚”提到占卦的情形，有“索藑茅以?篿”的话。藑茅是一种灵草，?篿是竹桮筊。结草判竹掷地，视其俯仰，以卜吉凶，本是楚国民间的风俗。这种风俗过去南方各地还普遍得很。至于“离骚”的巫咸降神，“招魂”的巫阳招魂，也都是楚国民俗的反映。
    第五是富于故事性。“离骚”虽然是抒情诗，但故事性很强。一开始它就用传记的体裁来叙述自己的世系、祖考、生辰和名字，接着就叙述自己的性格、才能、志愿和遭遇。然后假设女嬃责骂、灵氛占卦、巫咸降神三大段对话的形式来充实故事的内容。在女嬃骂他之后，又幻想就重华去陈词，而继之以叩阍求女，这是“离骚”中最热闹的一段，也是故事性发展到最高峰的时候。其后屈原听了灵氛的劝告，离开祖国了，他便驾着飞龙，转道昆仑山，发天津，至西极，经过流沙赤水，最后路过不周山，想到西海去。他忽然在空中看见祖国，终于舍不得走，伟大的“离骚”也就这样地结束了。这种充满了故事性的作风也是从民间文学中出来的。
    第六是想像力非常丰富。例如“离骚”在陈词重华之后，幻想上叩天阍，驾云乘龙，御日驱月，飞廉雷师供其奔走；飘风云霓都来欢迎。及天门不开，乃济白水，登阆风，游春宫，求宓妃，在天上再兜一个圈子才下来。真是设想新奇，得未曾有。而“招魂”一篇描写四方上下许多可怕的事物，如长人千仞，雄虺九首，赤蚁若象，玄蜂若壶（瓠），豺狼纵目，土伯九约等，更是想入非非。如果我们了解屈原的文学资料多半渊源于民间神话，那就不足为奇了。
    三
    屈原是我们民族的热爱祖国、热爱人民的伟大诗人。
    战国时代许多有才能的人们如果在本国没有遇到机会，就多半跑到别国去以求自己事业的发展。当楚怀王不信任屈原的时候，屈原本来可以走，然而他考虑的结果是否定的。他说：
    “欲高飞而远集兮，
    君罔谓汝何之？
    欲横奔而失路兮，
    盖志坚而不忍。”——“惜诵”后来情况越来越坏，至于一再放逐，他还是可以走的，然而他终于不肯走。虽然他不但郑重地考虑过这个问题，而且设想已经走了，但最后呢？他在去国的途中又折回来了。可见他不肯为了个人打算而轻易离开祖国。虽然一再动念要走，但终于一再地克服它，这是何等坚决的意志。所以屈原是一个自觉的有高度热情的爱国主义者。
    根据屈原的自述，他是非常同情人民的，念念不忘人民的。因此他在内政外交上的一切措施和主张自然会符合人民的要求和愿望。举例来说罢：楚国很早有一个贤明的令尹，名叫子文。为了维护国家法令的尊严，不包庇他的犯法的族人而受到人民的赞美，在歌谣中说他“方正公平”。屈原所草拟的宪令是公平合理的，当然会得到人民的欢迎，但正因为如此，贵族的特权人物才会感到不方便，才会表示反对，因而才会想方设法来排挤他，陷害他。又如屈原主张抗秦，反对亲秦，而这一主张也同当时的楚国人民一致。所以后来怀王入秦不返，人民非常痛心，竟有三户亡秦之谚。数十年后，拿起锄头发动革命，推翻秦国统治的就是楚国各阶层人民。参加这次反秦运动的，现在可考的单楚国就有三十余人，其中有贫雇农，有小商人，有低级官吏，有地方绅士，也有没落的贵族，他们都以恢复楚国相号召，这岂是一件偶然的事吗？可以想像，屈原的文学及其思想行动多少起过一定的作用。
    其次，屈原的文学在我国文学史上发生了极大的影响。屈原的文学有丰富的生活内容，现实性非常的强，斗争性也非常的强；又有丰富的人民意识，大量的民间文学的资料以及通俗的为人民所爱好的民间文学形式，因此它的人民性也就特别强。我国文学向来以“风”“骚”并称，“风”是“国风”，代表“诗经”，“骚”是“离骚”，代表“楚辞”，它们在上述各方面基本上是相同的。自从屈原遗留下来许多伟大的作品以后，二千多年来，多少文人没有不爱好的，没有不受其影响的。他们不断地模仿其体裁和作风，特别是他的爱祖国爱人民的思想和热情。有很多诗人都受到了极深刻的教育，如杜甫、白居易、陆游等都非常向往他，崇拜他。
    屈原这样伟大的诗人，是值得我们全国人民永远崇敬，永远纪念的。我们为着祖国有了这样一个伟大的诗人而感到骄傲。
