Writing a Letter to the Motherland
    Wang Ying
    Here is the position guarded by a unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army artillery. When they received the gifts from the people of the motherland, everyone wanted to immediately write a letter to the motherland to express their joy upon receiving the gifts. However, they were busy building fortifications and couldn't spare the time. During the ten-minute midday break, squad leader Li Hongguo and soldier Gao Guangde didn't rest; instead, they immediately wrote a letter to Chairman Mao. The letter said: "Dear Chairman Mao:
    We will never forget you. Under your leadership, our beloved motherland has become a happy paradise, and five hundred million compatriots are united like brothers and sisters. When we see your picture, we are so happy that we cannot speak. It is as if you have already come to our position and are with us. With you, we will always be victorious."
    There were many more things they wanted to say to Chairman Mao, but they wanted to continue writing, but the ten minutes passed quickly. So, they added the sentence "Wishing you boundless longevity!" and wrote their names before rushing out to continue building fortifications.
    At night, in the tunnel, under the flickering lamplight, the soldiers who were off duty were all burying their heads in writing letters to the motherland. Gao Guangde came back from his shift in the middle of the night, but he didn't go to sleep immediately. He thought: I should also write a letter to the people of the motherland – yes, that's what I'll do.
    "I grew up in the beloved motherland, born into a poor peasant family in old China." As Gao Guangde picked up his pen, he remembered his own painful childhood: he lost his mother at a young age and lived with his father and older brother. He was selling vegetables by carrying a shoulder pole when he was only a teenager. The small age, hundreds of pounds of burden often pressed on his body, less than twenty years old, he pressed his spine bent. "How bitter my childhood was!" As he wrote this, his tears fell like rain. It wasn't until he realized that the handkerchief he was using to wipe his tears was one of the gifts sent by the motherland today that he continued writing:
    "In 1949, our hometown was liberated. The People's Government led us in carrying out land reform, and my family was allocated eight mu of land. We no longer had to pay that ten shi of rent. Do you think my family's life is good or not?
    "I am a youth who has turned over a new leaf, and I know how happiness is obtained. I cannot stand by and watch the American bandits invade our neighbor, Korea. So, in March 1951, I voluntarily joined the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. At first, I only had a full of political enthusiasm of 'Resist America, Aid Korea, Protect Our Homes and Defend Our Country', and I didn't understand combat at all. Now I have mastered weapons and improved my education. In the tempering of war, I have transformed from an ordinary farmer into a soldier capable of operating modern artillery.
    "Dear people of the motherland! Do not worry about us. We have created a position life that you cannot imagine through combat and labor. We have classrooms, dining halls, bathhouses, clubs, Mao Zedong Road, Stalin Street... Comrades sing songs: 'Firmly defend the heroic land, conquer the mountain of culture! Combat is heroic, learning is exemplary!'
    "The beloved motherland has sent us these precious gifts again. I can only swear to you! Beloved motherland! I will always be your brave combatant, forever protecting you – my mother!"
    After Gao Guangde finished writing the letter, he wrote on the envelope:
    "To the beloved motherland – my mother
    To the great people of the motherland"
    On the back, he also wrote a line:
    "Let it fly over countless mountains to Beijing!"
    Gao Guangde read the letter from beginning to end again before he finally breathed a sigh of relief. He wanted to take the letter to the squad leader to see, but when he looked up, the squad leader was not there. It turned out that the squad leader had also gone to another tunnel to write his own letter.
    As soon as it dawned, Gao Guangde hurried to get up and rushed to give the letter to the instructor. Unexpectedly, the instructor's desk was already piled with letters. The instructor read them one by one: Li Tianxiong, commander of the fourth gun and holder of a third-class merit, wrote: "Guarantee loud commands, accurate calculations, and rapid commands." Zhang Daoxiu, telephone squad leader and holder of a second-class merit, wrote: "Guarantee that the line is always open!" Li Jiechen, first gunner and holder of a third-class merit, wrote: "Aim accurately, operate skillfully, and hit the target every time." Xiao Shengwan, observer and holder of a third-class merit, wrote: "Observe carefully and don't let a single American devil escape." Hu Zhangmu, cook, wrote: "Make the rice well, make the dishes fragrant, and let the comrades' faces shine after eating." Li Wanlin, medic, wrote: "I will do a good job in sanitation so that all comrades are healthy and strong, and they will be as lively as dragons and tigers in battle." Wei Tianxi, driver, wrote: "Cherish vehicles as if they were our lives and guarantee the timely supply of grain and ammunition." Yin Weiyi, ammunition transporter, wrote: "Carry grain early and send ammunition late. We are not afraid of difficulties for the sake of victory and will be a steel man on the transportation line!" Su Bingchen, engineer, wrote: "I chisel mountains day and night to build our position home. We will turn the barren mountains into paradise." Liu Shaode, gunner, wrote: "Words are long, but paper is short, so I won't write much more. You build peace, and we defend peace. Let's have a competition! When peace is realized, we will meet again!"...
    The instructor carefully packed these letters and wrote neatly on the envelope:
    "Beloved motherland – my mother, don't worry! We guarantee your safety and wish your construction to progress a thousand miles a day!"

### 给祖国写信

    给祖国写信
    王颖
    这里是志愿军炮兵部队某部守卫的阵地，当他们接到祖国人民的慰问品时，大家都想立刻给祖国写信，表示自己接到慰问品以后欣喜的心情，可是正在做工事，腾不出手来。晌午休息十分钟，班长李鸿国和战士高广德，也不休息了，马上给毛主席写封信。信上写着：“亲爱的毛主席：
    我们永远忘不了您，可爱的祖国在你的领导下变成了幸福的乐园，五万万同胞团结得像兄弟。我们看到你的像片，都高兴得说不出话来，就好像看到你已经来到了我们的阵地，和我们在一起。只要有了你，我们就永远能胜利。”
    要对毛主席说的话多着呢，他们还想写下去，可是十分钟一下子就过去了。于是，又在后面加上一句“祝您万寿无疆！”写上两个人的名字，他们就跑出去继续做工事了。
    入夜，在坑道里，在摇曳的灯光下，换了班的战士都在埋头给祖国写信。高广德半夜换班回来，也没有立刻就睡，他想：还应该给祖国人民写封信——对，就这样决定了。
    “我生长在可爱的祖国，出生在旧中国的贫苦农民之家。”高广德提起笔来就想起自己的痛苦的童年：他从小就死了母亲，跟着父亲和哥哥过活。十几岁就挑担卖菜，小小的年纪，百十斤的担子经常压在身上，不到二十岁，就把脊梁压弯了。“我的童年的生活是多苦啊！”写到这里，他的泪珠扑簌簌地落了下来，直到他发现拿着擦泪的手绢是今天送来的祖国慰问品时，又继续写了下去：
    “一九四九年，我们家乡解放了，人民政府领导我们进行土地改革，我家分了八亩田，再也不要缴那十石租。你想我家生活好不好？
    “我是一个翻了身的青年，我知道幸福是怎样得来的。我不能看着美国强盗侵略我们的邻国朝鲜，就在一九五一年三月自动参加了志愿军。起初我只有满腔‘抗美援朝保家卫国’的政治热情，完全不懂得作战，现在我已掌握了武器，提高了文化。在战火锻炼中，我已经从一个普通的农民，变成一个能够操纵现代化大炮的战士了。
    “亲爱的祖国人民！不必惦记我们。我们用战斗和劳动创造了你们想像不到的阵地生活。我们这里有课堂，有饭厅，有澡塘，有俱乐部，有毛泽东路，斯大林街……同志们唱着歌：‘坚守英雄地，攻克文化山！战斗是英雄，学习是模范！’
    “可爱的祖国又给我们送来这些珍贵的礼物，我只有向您宣誓！可爱的祖国！我永远是您的勇敢的战斗员，永远保卫着您——我的母亲！”
    高广德写完了信，又在信封上写着：
    “寄给可爱的祖国——我的母亲
    伟大的祖国人民收”
    背面还写了一行字：
    “让它越过万重高山飞到北京去吧！”
    高广德又把信从头到尾念了一遍，这才松了一口气。他想把信拿给班长看看，抬头一看，班长不在，原来班长也跑到另一个坑道里去写自己的信去了。
    天刚发亮，高广德赶忙起来，争先把信送给指导员，想不到指导员的桌子上早已堆满了信。指导员一封封地念着：四炮炮长、三等功臣李天雄写道：“保证口令宏亮，计算精确，指挥迅速。”电话班长、二等功臣张道秀写道：“保证人在线通！”一炮手、三等功臣李杰臣写道：“准确瞄准，熟练操作，百发百中。”观测员、三等功臣萧圣万写道：“细心观测，不放走一个美国鬼子。”炊事员胡樟木写道：“饭做好，菜做香，同志们吃了脸发亮。”卫生员李万林写道：“我要做好卫生工作，使同志们人人身体健壮，打起仗来，像生龙活虎一样。”司机魏天喜写道：“爱护车辆如同生命，保证粮弹及时供应。”弹药运输员尹维义写道：“早背粮，晚送弹，为了胜利不怕难，做个运输线上的钢铁汉！”工兵苏炳臣写道：“我日日夜夜凿山开山，建设阵地之家，要把荒山变乐园。”炮手刘绍德写道：“话长纸短，不再多写。你们和平建设，我们保卫和平，就来一个竞赛吧！和平实现，我们再见！”……
    指导员把这些信细心地包装好，在封皮上端端正正地写着：
    “可爱的祖国——我的母亲，不必挂念！我们保证你的安全，祝你的建设一日千里！”
