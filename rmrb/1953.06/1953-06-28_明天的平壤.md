　　Tomorrow's Pyongyang
　　Xin Qin
　　On my desk is a stack of *New Korea* magazines published in Pyongyang. This is a monthly magazine published by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in Chinese, Russian, and English to report on the situation in Korea to foreign countries. I am currently reading the April 1953 issue. Suddenly, on page fifteen, a moving title appeared: "Tomorrow's Pyongyang." With excitement and longing, I read the article.
　　In the beginning of the article, the author briefly described the history, geography, and natural scenery surrounding Pyongyang: this ancient city with more than two thousand years of history has long been "the center of light industry and coal mining in North Korea... It is the largest river port in North Korea. The green waters of the Taedong River, the verdant pines of Moranbong Hill, and the weeping willows of Rungrado Island interweave to form a beautiful landscape."
　　After the liberation of northern Korea, Pyongyang underwent large-scale construction, and its appearance changed day by day. "Many industrial organs appeared at once. Workers' residences, cultural and recreational facilities also increased with the development of factories... The city greatly expanded the water supply area... Most roads have been paved with asphalt and cement... Rest areas and playgrounds have been set up in Moranbong Park... A large theater, the Moranbong Theater, was built... A five-story building of Kim Il-sung University was built on the slope of Ryonghung-ri. In addition, there are many newly built high-rise buildings such as the General Hospital, *Rodong Sinmun* Newspaper, and the Foreign Language School..." The ancient cultural capital regained its youth, blossoming like a flower on the banks of the Taedong River and under Moranbong Hill. Pyongyang became the center of the young republic, a paradise for the people's labor and life.
　　However, the war interrupted the peaceful life of the Korean people, and the claws of the American aggressors reached into the northern part of the peninsula. Thousands of tons of steel, gunpowder, and napalm were poured down from the sky over peaceful towns. Beautiful Pyongyang became unrecognizable, "Many historical relics and monuments, as well as various buildings newly built after liberation, have disappeared without a trace. This ancient city with more than two thousand years of history has been completely reduced to ruins."
　　However, Pyongyang will never yield. "The heroic people of the heroic city enthusiastically responded to the call of their beloved leader Marshal Kim Il-sung, persevering in hard life in basements and air-raid shelters, carrying out various production tasks with the conviction of certain victory, and engaging in the city's restoration work."
　　In May 1952, the Cabinet of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea decided to begin formulating a reconstruction plan for Pyongyang.
　　This plan outlines the future appearance of Pyongyang: residential areas will be built farther away from factory areas, and the former slum areas will be transformed into quiet residential areas with sanitary and cultural facilities. Many high-rise buildings for workers to live in will be built along the river and in the city center. The city center will be set against the backdrop of Namsan Mountain, located on the right bank of the Taedong River. In its center will be Kim Il-sung Square, where a bronze statue of Marshal Kim Il-sung will be erected. The office buildings of various important institutions will be built around the square. Kim Il-sung Square will be connected to the main street of the city, Stalin Avenue, which will be twice as wide as the original. This straight avenue will be 2.3 kilometers long and 45 meters wide. Evergreen trees will be planted on both sides. A park will be built on one side of this avenue, and a new theater will be built in the park. A bronze statue of Comrade Stalin will be erected in front of the theater, expressing the Korean people's eternal gratitude to their liberator. The end of Stalin Avenue is connected to another avenue, from which one can reach Kanggye in the north and Sinuiju in the northwest via the highway. To express their love and respect for the Chinese People's Volunteers and the great leader of the Chinese people, the Korean people decided to name this avenue Mao Zedong Road.
　　The reconstruction plan of Pyongyang pays great attention to the rest and cultural life of the residents. Many tree-lined roads will be opened up between the city streets and the banks of the Taedong River. Weeping willows, the favorite tree of the Korean people, will be planted on both sides, and soft lawns like carpets will be laid. Here, bronze statues of the leaders and heroes of the republic, who will be forever remembered by the Korean people, will also be erected. Moranbong Park will become a cultural and recreational park with various modern cultural facilities. Various stadiums and swimming pools will be built on the green Rungrado Island, making it the city's sports center.
　　A large number of evergreen trees will be planted around the Soviet Army Liberation Memorial Tower on the southern slope of Moranbong Hill. Those scenic spots, historical sites, and cultural relics that have been severely damaged and plundered in the war will be restored to preserve the infinitely valuable heritage of national culture.
　　In the plan, the city will be divided into several residential areas, each with an area of four to eight hectares. Each residential area will have nurseries, kindergartens, gardens, and private carports. In the central open space of the residential area, resting places and children's playgrounds will be set up. Pavilions and fountains will also be set up in the middle. The houses along the central streets of the city will all be built into five-story buildings. Food stores, department stores, bookstores, and pharmacies will be set up on the ground floor of these buildings, while the upper floors will be used for housing, kindergartens, and nurseries.
　　Issues such as water and electricity, transportation, heating, and communication in the city also occupy an important position in the plan and have been properly arranged and resolved.
　　Now the war has not ended, the land of Korea and everything on it are still being destroyed by the invaders, and the Korean people are still living a hard wartime life, but they are already preparing to rebuild tomorrow's Pyongyang and planning for the future. Only those who firmly believe in the sure victory of their just cause, only those who have infinite confidence and the greatest courage in their future, can do this. The plan to rebuild Pyongyang is by no means a fantasy, but a manifestation of the Korean people's strong will and endless creativity. Only those who have defended and rebuilt Stalingrad, only those who are building a new life in China, Poland, the German Democratic Republic... can understand this love for peaceful life and longing for the future.
　　"The working people of Pyongyang, full of confidence in the final victory of the war and the beautiful prospects of the future, have already begun to put this plan into practice," the author said at the end, "In this difficult wartime environment, they have greatly promoted the sorting out of the Stalin Avenue and Kim Il-sung Square base.
　　"In order to restore the green forest areas inside and outside the city that were destroyed and burned by the enemy, thousands of working people and public officials, regardless of the enemy's constant indiscriminate bombing, have launched extensive tree-planting campaigns with new enthusiasm in accordance with the reconstruction plan."
　　Tomorrow belongs to the Korean people. The dawn of peace will eventually shine on Moranbong Hill. On that day, the heroic Pyongyang will be rebuilt from the ruins according to this plan, and the people there will once again breathe fresh, free air and create a new and happier life in a peaceful and quiet environment.

　　明天的平壤
    心钦
    我的桌上摆着一叠平壤出版的《新朝鲜》杂志，这是朝鲜民主主义人民共和国用中、俄、英三种文字向外国报道朝鲜情况的月刊，我正在翻阅一九五三年的四月号。突然，在第十五页上，出现了一个动人的标题：“明日的平壤”，我怀着激动和向往的心情把这篇文章读了一遍。
    在文章的开头，作者简述了平壤的历史、地理和它周围的自然景物：这个已有两千多年历史的古老的城市，很早以来就是“北朝鲜的轻工业和采炭业的中心。……是北朝鲜的最大江港。大同江的碧流、牡丹峰的苍松和绫罗岛的垂柳交织成一幅美丽的风景图”。
    朝鲜北部解放以后，平壤进行了大规模的建设，它的面貌一天天地改变了。“一时出现了许多产业机关。工人住宅、文化和休养设施等也随着工厂的发达而增多起来了。……市内大大扩展了自来水的供应区域……大部分道路也已铺上了柏油和水泥。……在牡丹峰公园里设立了休憩所和游戏场……，盖了一座较大的戏院——牡丹峰剧场。……在龙兴里的土坡上盖了金日成综合大学的五层大厦。此外还有综合医院、劳动新闻社，外国语文学校等新盖的许多高层建筑物……”，古老的文化都城恢复了自己的青春，像一朵鲜花一样，在大同江畔和牡丹峰下盛开起来。平壤成了年青的共和国的中心，成了人民的劳动和生活的乐园。
    但是，战争打断了朝鲜人民的和平生活，美国侵略者的魔爪伸入了半岛的北部。成千成万吨的钢铁、火药和凝固汽油，从和平城镇的上空倾泻下来。美丽的平壤变得面目全非了，“许多有历史价值的古迹和纪念物以及解放后新建的各种建筑物，已经看不见它们的影子，有两千多年历史的这一座古城整个地变成了一片废墟。”
    但是，平壤是永远不屈的。“英雄城市的英雄人民热烈响应敬爱的领袖金日成元帅的号召，在地下室和防空洞里坚持着艰苦的生活，以必胜的信心进行各种生产工作，并从事城市的复兴工作。”
    一九五二年五月，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国内阁决定着手制定平壤市的复兴计划。
    这个计划规划着未来的平壤的面貌：住宅区将建立在离工厂区较远的地方，从前的贫民区将改造成具有卫生和文化设备的安静的住宅区。在江边和城市的中心将建立供工人居住的许多高楼大厦，全城的中心将以南山为背景，而位于大同江的右岸。在它的中央将设立金日成广场，在广场上将建立金日成元帅的铜像，广场的周围将建筑各重要机关的办公大厦。金日成广场和全市的中心街道——比原来的宽度要增加两倍的斯大林大路相连接，这条笔直的大道长二点三公里，宽四十五公尺。在它的两旁，将栽种常青的树木。在这条大路的一边将修建一座公园，公园里还要建筑一座新的剧院，剧院的前面将塑造斯大林同志的铜像。以表现朝鲜人民对自己的解放恩人的永恒的感激。斯大林大路的终点又和另一条大道相连接，从这条大道可以经过公路通达北部的江界和西北的新义州。为了表示对中国人民志愿军和中国人民伟大领袖的热爱和崇敬，朝鲜人民决定把这条大道命名为毛泽东路。
    平壤市的再建计划十分注意居民的休息和文化生活。在从市街到大同江边之间，将开辟很多林荫路，在它的两旁，将栽上朝鲜人民最喜爱的垂杨，铺设像地毯一样的柔软的草地。在这里还将建立被朝鲜人民永念不忘的共和国的领袖们和英雄们的铜像。牡丹峰公园将成为具有各种现代文化设备的文化休息公园。在绿荫掩映的绫罗岛上将建立起各种球场和游泳场，使它成为全城的体育中心地。
    在牡丹峰南坡的苏军解放纪念塔的周围将种植大批常青树木，而对于那些在战争中遭受严重破坏和劫掠的名胜、古迹和文物，将一律加以修复，以保存具有无限价值的民族文化的遗产。
    在计划中，全市将划分成好几个住宅区，每一个住宅区的面积是四至八公顷，在每一个住宅区里都有托儿所、幼稚园、庭园和私用汽车房。在住宅区的中央空地上，将辟设休息场所和儿童游戏场。中间还要设立凉亭和喷水池。市中央街道旁边的房屋将一律建成五层大楼。在这些楼房的底层将设立食品店、百货店、书店和药房，其上则为住房、幼稚园和托儿所。
    市内的水电、交通、取暖和通讯等问题，在计划中也占着重要的地位，而有着适当的安排和解决。
    现在战争还没有结束，朝鲜的土地和它上面的一切仍然在遭受着侵略者的破坏，朝鲜人民还在过着艰苦的战时生活，但是他们却已在准备重建明天的平壤，计划着未来的生活了。这只有坚信自己正义事业的必胜的前途，只有对于自己的未来抱着无限信心和最大勇气的人们，才能够这样。重建平壤的计划绝不是一种空想，而是朝鲜人民的坚强意志和无尽的创造力的表现。这种热爱和平生活，憧憬未来的心情，只有保卫了并重建了斯大林格勒的人们，只有那些正在建设着新生活的中国的、波兰的、德意志民主共和国的……人们，才能够理解。
    “对于战争的最后胜利和未来的美丽远景满怀信心的平壤市劳动人民，已经着手实践这一计划”，作者在最后说，“在这困难的战争环境中，他们已经大大推进了斯大林大路和金日成广场基地的整理工作。
    “为了恢复那些被敌人破坏和烧毁的城里城外的绿林地区，已经有数以千计的劳动人民和公务人员，不顾敌机的不断滥炸，按照再建计划，以新的热情展开了广泛的植树运动。”
    明天是属于朝鲜人民的。和平的曙光终将照耀在牡丹峰上，到那一天，英雄的平壤将在废墟中按照这个计划重建起来，那里的人们将重新呼吸新鲜的自由的空气，在和平的安静的环境中创造新的更幸福的生活。
