Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, June 27th: Dmitri Monin commented on the international labor movement in an article in "Labor News," saying that the Japanese working class is strengthening their struggle for bread and work, democracy and peace. The rapidly developing strike movement in Japan is developing into a struggle for peace and national independence.

Monin mentioned the march and demonstration of tens of thousands of workers held in Tokyo on June 20th by the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (referred to as "Sohyo") to oppose fascist bills and demand increased wages and summer allowances, as well as the demonstrations and short-term strikes held by 1.5 million workers in other industrial centers. He pointed out that the movement protesting the fascist measures of the Yoshida government is only the beginning. The All-Japan Industrial Trade Union Conference, the Japan Electrical Industry Workers' Union, the Japan Coal Miners' Union, the All-Japan Automobile Industry Workers' Union and other trade unions are preparing for battle. Recently, these trade unions have decided to prepare to launch a nationwide strike.

Monin pointed out that the upsurge of strike struggles proves the further political maturity and increasing unity of the Japanese working class. Despite the divisive activities of some trade union leaders, the working class is resolutely fighting for its rights and the unity of its ranks. Committees fighting against the anti-strike law are being organized everywhere by workers belonging to various parties and trade unions.

Referring to the recent heroic struggle of Japanese peasants, supported by the working class, against turning Mount Asama and Uchinada Village into training grounds for the U.S. military, Monin wrote: This movement demonstrates the increasing unity of the working people, and it has developed into a nationwide struggle against the establishment of U.S. military bases and against the Yoshida government's anti-people policies.

Monin went on to say that preparations for the fourth congress of "Sohyo" are now being carried out under the slogan of establishing a united front. This congress will be held from July 8th to 11th. Despite the fact that a splinter organization established by right-wing trade union leaders, the "National Council for the Liaison of Democratic Labor Movements," is doing its best to undermine the unity of "Sohyo," the strength of "Sohyo" is increasing day by day. Its international ties with workers in China and other Asian countries are also expanding.

In conclusion, Monin said that the broad masses of Japanese working people are increasingly aware that only by taking militant action and consolidating unity can the working class repel the attacks of the reactionaries and win victory in the struggle for peace and national independence.

    苏联“劳动报”载文评日本工人运动的发展
    【新华社二十九日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科二十七日讯：德米特里·莫宁在“劳动报”上撰文评论国际劳工运动说：日本工人阶级正在加强他们为争取面包与工作、民主与和平的斗争。日本迅速发展的罢工运动正在发展为争取和平与民族独立的斗争。
    莫宁提到六月二十日日本工会总评议会（简称“总评”）为了反对法西斯法案、要求增加工资和发给夏季津贴在东京主持的几万工人的游行示威，以及在其他工业中心的一百五十万工人所举行的示威游行和短期罢工。他指出：抗议吉田政府的法西斯措施的运动现在还只是开端。全日本产业别工会会议、日本电气产业工会、日本煤矿工会、全日本汽车产业工会和其他的工会都在进行战斗的准备。最近这些工会都决定准备发动全国性的罢工。
    莫宁指出：罢工斗争的高涨，证明了日本工人阶级在政治上进一步的成熟和日益团结。尽管有些工会领袖进行分裂活动，工人阶级还是坚决为争取自己的权利和它的队伍的统一而斗争。为反对禁止罢工法而进行斗争的委员会正在各地由属于各个不同的党派和工会的工人们组织起来。
    莫宁谈到最近日本农民在工人阶级的支持下所进行的反对变浅间山和内滩村为美军演习场的英勇斗争时写道：这个运动证明了劳动人民日益增涨的团结，它已发展成为反对建立美国军事基地和反对吉田政府反人民政策的全国范围的斗争。
    莫宁接着说，召开“总评”第四届大会的准备工作，现在正在建立统一战线的口号下进行着。这次大会将在七月八日到十一日的期间举行。尽管右翼工会领袖建立的一个分裂组织“全国民主主义劳工运动联络协议会”尽其所能地破坏“总评”的团结，“总评”的力量还是日益高涨。它和中国及其他亚洲国家工人的国际性联系也在扩展中。
    莫宁在结语中说，广大的日本劳动人民群众日益明确地认识到：只有采取战斗的行动和巩固团结，工人阶级才能击退反动派的进攻，在争取和平及民族独立的斗争中取得胜利。
