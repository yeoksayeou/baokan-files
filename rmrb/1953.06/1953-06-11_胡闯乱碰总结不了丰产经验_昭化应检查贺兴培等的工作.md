    Random Fumbling Cannot Summarize 丰产 Experiences
    Zhaohua Should Investigate the Work of He Xingpei and Others
    A letter from Liu Bingzhong and other comrades from the Shipan Township Correspondence Group in Zhaohua County, Sichuan Province: The work group composed of He Xingpei, Deputy Section Chief of the Construction Section of the Zhaohua County People's Government in Sichuan, Wang Yongquan, cadre of the Agriculture and Forestry Section, Shu Zhongling, cadre of the Health Section, and five others came to Shipan Township on March 15 to summarize corn 丰产 (bumper harvest) experiences. Instead of understanding the situation, helping and relying on the masses to summarize experiences, they divided into groups of three or four and fumbled around in the villages. At the beginning, they went to the home of a rich peasant named Zhang Yuze and asked without explanation, "How was your corn harvest last year? What experiences do you have to share?" After talking for a long time, they got nothing. They thought this was because the peasants were ideologically conservative. So they ran to the homes of landlords Wu Shide and Wang Yongchang, but the two landlords couldn't say anything of value either. They thought this was because they were worried. In fact, there were many farmers with 丰产 (bumper harvest) experience in corn in the first and second villages, such as Zhang Zhengpei and Zhang Minggui in the first village, and Zhang Mingkuan in the second village, but they didn't meet them. They were just stumbling around in the village. The masses didn't know what they were doing. Because the Marriage Law was being promoted at the time, everyone thought they were collecting materials on past violations of the Marriage Law in the village, which aroused panic among the masses. What was especially serious was that they stayed in the township for three days and went to the home of landlord Dai Ji in nearby Shipan Market to eat every day, eating fish and meat at every meal. On the 17th, when Shipan Market opened, they went to the butcher early in the morning to order pig kidneys, livers, etc. The township cadres' evaluation of them was "What kind of experience are they summarizing? They're just coming down to get a few names, then going back and making it up." Some of the masses said, "The way they work, they are just eating the people's rice for nothing." We suggest that the Zhaohua County People's Government strictly investigate the work of He Xingpei and other comrades who went to the countryside.

### 胡闯乱碰总结不了丰产经验  昭化应检查贺兴培等的工作

专栏：读者来信摘要

    胡闯乱碰总结不了丰产经验
    昭化应检查贺兴培等的工作
    四川昭化县石盘乡通讯组刘秉忠等同志来信：四川昭化县人民政府建设科副科长贺兴培、农林科干部王永全、卫生科干部舒钟灵等八人组成的工作组在三月十五日到石盘乡总结玉米丰产经验，他们不是在了解情况、帮助和依靠群众的基础上总结经验，而是三四个人分作一组到村里胡闯乱碰。他们开头就到一户富农张雨泽家里，青不说白不说便问：“你去年苞谷的收成怎样，有啥经验谈一谈”。谈了半天，啥也没谈出。他们认为这是农民思想保守。于是他们又跑到地主吴世德、王永昌家里去，两户地主也谈不出个名堂，他们认为这是有顾虑。其实一、二村有苞谷丰产经验的农民并不少，比如一村农民张正培、张明贵，二村农民张明宽等，可是他们没有碰上。他们这样到村里乱闯乱碰，群众不知他们是做啥的。因为当时正在宣传婚姻法，大家以为他们是收集村里过去违反婚姻法的材料，反而引起了群众的惊惶。尤其严重的是，他们在该乡住了三天，每天都要跑到附近石盘场上地主戴吉家去吃饭，每顿要吃鱼、肉。十七日石盘逢场，他们一早就到屠夫那里去把猪腰子、肝子等定下。该乡干部给他们的评语是“总结个啥经验，就是下来开上几个名字，回去编编罢了。”还有的群众说：“他们那样工作，白把人民的米吃了。”我们建议昭化县人民政府严格地检查贺兴培等同志下乡的工作。
