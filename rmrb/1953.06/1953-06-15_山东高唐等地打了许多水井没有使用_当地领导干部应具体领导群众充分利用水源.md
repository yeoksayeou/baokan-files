Many Wells Dug in Gaotang, Shandong, and Other Places Are Not Used; Local Leaders Should Concretely Lead the Masses to Fully Utilize Water Sources

In Gaotang, Xin County, Shandong Province, and other places, many wells have been dug, which have played a certain role in combating drought and protecting seedlings. However, the utilization rate of many wells is very low. There were serious shortcomings in the well-drilling work in these places in the past. The leadership did not understand the situation and blindly assigned tasks, lacking in-depth and specific guidance. As a result, many grassroots cadres mistakenly believed that developing water conservancy construction meant only digging wells, and that everything would be fine as long as the wells were dug well. Therefore, they forced the masses to dig wells in a big way. After the wells were dug, they did not actively lead the masses to use them, and then mobilized the masses to dig new wells. By the end of last year, Han Zhang Township in Xin County had dug a total of 91 wells, which is not a small number. However, this spring, the local area was dry, with the soil generally dry to a depth of seven or eight inches. Until the beginning of May, the entire township used well water to irrigate only 31 mu of wheat. This year, the township plans to dig 200 new wells. The masses reflected: "Digging wells is a bottomless pit, only taking money and materials from outside, and we can't see the benefits."

Cadres simply pursue the number of wells dug, and the speed of well increase exceeds the current labor conditions and economic strength of some of the peasant masses. Many well-owning households cannot use the wells immediately because they have no money to borrow waterwheels, or they have borrowed waterwheels but lack labor. Wang Youfang of Yangzaizi Village has a field of seven mu, adjacent to the seven mu field of Gao Longji in the same village. Last year, the cadres said that his land was "suitable for soil quality" and repeatedly mobilized him to dig a well. Wang's economic situation was not good, and he could not afford to dig a well himself, but the cadres insisted that he dig a well. He discussed with Gao Longji to dig a well together (one well can irrigate more than ten mu). However, the cadres did not allow it, saying: "If everyone is like you, how can the tasks assigned by the superiors be completed!" In the end, the two households had to dig one well each. Wang Youfang spent 1.2 million yuan to dig a well in April last year, but he still has no money to borrow a waterwheel.

Because the cadres particularly emphasized digging more wells, the phenomenon of individual farming has increased day by day in well-drilling work. In 1951, Yangzaizi Township of Gaotang County dug 12 wells, of which individual digging accounted for five; in 1952, 153 wells were dug, and individual digging accounted for 52; this year, the township dug another 59 wells, and individual digging accounted for as many as 44. One well is dug for five or six mu of land, and the wells are too dense, wasting water resources. According to statistics, the wells in these two counties are generally used only one-third to one-half of the time, the highest is seven or eight-tenths, and not many are fully used. The wells that are used generally irrigate only one or two mu of land on average, and no more than ten mu at most. Therefore, in Gaotang, Xin County, and other places, we should no longer simply pursue the number of wells dug, but should lead the masses and organize the masses to use the existing wells rationally, give full play to the maximum effectiveness of water resources, and expand the irrigated area. The leading cadres in these places should deeply examine the leading ideology and methods of leadership in the construction of farmland water conservancy in the past, and strengthen policy education and ideological education for grassroots cadres, teaching them to learn to do work with correct methods. We should educate the masses to organize neighbors to use wells and borrow waterwheels on the principle of voluntariness and mutual benefit, and strive to make full use of the existing water sources as soon as possible.

After the wheat harvest, all localities should, according to local conditions, appropriately mobilize the masses to conduct a general inspection of wells and waterwheels, repair the damaged ones in a timely manner, mobilize those who have not borrowed waterwheels to borrow them early and quickly, and cone the wells with insufficient water sources. At the same time, in conjunction with the summer planting work, we should mobilize the masses to do a good job in preparing for irrigation such as "leveling the land," "opening ditches," and "tidying up the ridges," so as to ensure full seedlings and vigorous seedlings, and strive to complete the glorious task of increasing grain production.

    山东高唐等地打了许多水井没有使用
    当地领导干部应具体领导群众充分利用水源
    山东高唐、莘县等地打了不少井，在抗旱保苗上起了一定的作用；但是，有许多井的利用率是很低的。这些地方过去打井工作中有较严重的缺点。领导方面不了解下情，盲目布置任务，缺少深入具体的指导。结果，很多基层干部错误地认为开展水利建设只有打井，只要把井打好万事大吉了。于是大轰大擂地强迫群众打井。井打成了，又不积极领导群众使用，便又动员群众打新井。莘县函丈乡到去年底共打井九十一眼，数量不能算少；但今春当地干旱，一般的地干到七、八寸深，直到五月上旬，全乡只用井水浇麦三十一亩。而该乡今年又计划打新井二百眼。群众反映：“打井是个无底洞，只是向外拿钱拿料，看不见好处在那里。”
    干部单纯追求打井的数字，水井增长的速度就超过了当前一部分农民群众的劳力条件和经济力量。很多井户打了井，因无钱贷水车，或贷了水车而劳力不足，这些井都不能马上利用。杨寨子村王有方有一块七亩大的田，与同村高隆基的七亩田相邻，去年干部说他的地“土质适合”，再三动员他打井。王经济情况不好，自己打不起，但干部一定要他打井。他便同高隆基商定两家伙打一眼（一眼井可浇十多亩）。但干部不准，并说：“如果都像你们一样，上级的任务怎能完成！”最后两户只得各打一眼。王有方去年四月份花一百二十万元打好的井，至今还没钱贷水车。
    由于干部特别强调多打井，在打井工作上出现了日益增加的单干现象。高唐杨寨子乡一九五一年打井十二眼，其中单打者占五眼；一九五二年打井一百五十三眼，单打的五十二眼；今年该乡又打井五十九眼，单打的竟占四十四眼。五、六亩地就打一眼井，井眼过密，浪费水源。据统计：这两个县的井一般只使用三分之一到二分之一，最高的用到十分之七八，全部使用起来的不多。用起来的水井，一般地平均只浇到一、二亩地，多者不超过十亩。因此，当前在高唐、莘县等地，不应再单纯追求打井数字，而应领导群众、组织群众，把已有的井合理地使用起来，发挥水源的最大效能，扩大浇地面积。这些地方的领导干部应深入检查过去对农田水利建设的领导思想和领导方法，并对基层干部加强政策教育和思想教育，教他们学会用正确的方法做工作。应当教育群众，在自愿两利的原则下，组织地邻伙用水井、伙贷水车，争取尽快把现有水源充分地使用起来。
    麦收以后各地应该根据当地情况，适当地发动群众普遍进行一次水井、水车的检查，把损坏的及时修好，动员没贷水车的早贷、快贷，把水源不足的井锥好。同时，还应结合夏种工作，发动群众做好“平地”“开沟”“整畦”等浇地准备工作，保证苗全、苗旺，争取完成增产粮食的光荣任务。 （马滨）
