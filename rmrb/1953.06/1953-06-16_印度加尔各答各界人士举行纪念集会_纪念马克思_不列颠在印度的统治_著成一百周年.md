    Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 15th—People from all walks of life in Calcutta, India, held a meeting on the 10th to commemorate the centenary of Karl Marx's essay "The British Rule in India." This essay was written on June 10, 1853, and published in the "New York Daily Tribune" on June 25 of the same year. On July 22, 1853, Marx wrote another article, "The Future Results of British Rule in India."
    The meeting was presided over by the well-known trade unionist Darani Goswami. When linguist Dr. Mahadev Saha spoke about the great significance of Marx's writings on India, he pointed out that Marx was the first to conduct scientific research on British rule in India and point out the path to liberation for the Indian people. Saha said: For a hundred years, the Marxist movement has developed extensively and deeply in many Asian countries. China, the largest country in Asia, has accepted the path pointed out by this revolutionary scholar, and the people of other colonial countries and dependent countries have also been inspired by Marx's great doctrines.
    The meeting also discussed the issue of translating Marx's works into various Indian languages.

    印度加尔各答各界人士举行纪念集会
    纪念马克思“不列颠在印度的统治”著成一百周年
    【新华社新德里十五日电】印度加尔各答各界人士在十日举行集会，纪念卡尔·马克思的论文“不列颠在印度的统治”著成一百周年。这篇论文是在一八五三年六月十日写成的，同年六月二十五日在“纽约每日论坛报”上发表。一八五三年七月二十二日，马克思又写了“不列颠在印度统治的未来结果”一文。
    集会由著名的工会工作者达拉尼·高斯瓦米主持。语言学家马哈迪夫·萨哈博士在谈到马克思关于印度的著作的伟大意义时指出，马克思是第一个对英国在印度的统治进行科学研究并指出印度人民解放道路的人。萨哈说：一百年以来，马克思主义运动已经在许多亚洲国家中广泛而深入地展开。亚洲最大的国家——中国——已经接受了这位革命学者指出的道路，其他殖民地国家和附属国的人民也受到马克思的伟大学说的鼓舞。
    会上还谈到把马克思的著作译成各种印度语文的问题。
