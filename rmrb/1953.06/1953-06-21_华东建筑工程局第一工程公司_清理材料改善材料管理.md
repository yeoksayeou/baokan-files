China East Construction Engineering Bureau No. 1 Engineering Company

Cleans Up Materials, Improves Materials Management

The China East Construction Engineering Bureau No. 1 Engineering Company, in mid-May, organized all its worksites, material warehouses, and transit stations to conduct a materials inventory and sorting effort. This initial effort clarified material stocks and laid a good foundation for reducing waste and improving materials supply work in the future.

During this inventory, it was discovered that the phenomenon of on-site material accumulation and waste was very serious in the past. Construction departments blindly applied for materials, and material departments blindly prepared and issued materials, resulting in many materials being used randomly and wastefully. According to calculations, after the entire company completes all its carry-over projects, there will still be a large surplus of fourteen major materials. For example, red and black bricks alone will have a surplus of 23.3 million pieces, worth 9.77 billion yuan (old currency). At the same time, some materials such as cement and steel bars are still in short supply. Currently, the No. 1 Engineering Company is planning to allocate surplus materials and purchase certain deficient materials. It is also continuing to mobilize employees to further examine issues in material supply and management, and is preparing to establish and improve various systems for material management.

    华东建筑工程局第一工程公司
    清理材料改善材料管理
    华东建筑工程局第一工程公司，在五月中组织所属各个工地、材料仓库和吞吐站等单位，进行了一次材料清查和整理工作，初步摸清了材料存底，为今后减少浪费、改善材料供应工作打下良好的基础。
    在这次清查中，发现过去现场积压和浪费材料的现象很严重。施工部门盲目地申请材料，材料部门盲目地备料、发料，许多材料被乱拉乱用。据计算，整个公司在完成全部跨年度工程后，还有十四种主要材料要大批多余下来，其中只青砖红砖一项就要多余二千三百三十万块，价值人民币九十七亿七千多万元；同时，有些材料如水泥、钢筋等则还短少。目前第一工程公司正在有计划地调拨多余材料和添购某些欠缺的材料。并继续发动职工进一步检查材料供应和管理方面的问题，准备建立和健全材料管理方面的各种制度。　（据新华社讯）
