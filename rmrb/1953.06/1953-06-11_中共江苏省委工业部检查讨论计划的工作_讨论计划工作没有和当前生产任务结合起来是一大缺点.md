    The Industry Department of the Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party Inspects and Discusses Planning Work
    Discussion of Planning Work Not Integrated with Current Production Tasks is a Major Shortcoming
    At the end of May, the Industry Department of the Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party convened a meeting of responsible cadres from some factories and enterprises to inspect and discuss the work of national planning. The meeting was attended by the Party and government leaders of eight factories and two bureaus, including the state-owned Nanjing Machine Factory, Qishuyan Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory, Nanjing Radio Factory, Radio Factory, Factory 511, Factory 513, Automobile Repair Factory, Nanjing Railway Bureau, Nanjing Electric Power Administration Bureau, and the joint state-private owned Yongli Ning Factory. At the meeting, each factory and bureau reported on their production situation in April, and the Nanjing Machine Factory, Qishuyan Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory, and Yongli Ning Factory respectively introduced their experiences in preparing for discussions on the national plan and mobilizing the masses to formulate advanced targets.
    Judging from the reports of the factories and bureaus, although each unit has recently gained a deeper understanding of the national plan and has made preliminary achievements in implementing the plan, the biggest shortcoming is that they have not closely integrated the discussion of the plan with the completion of current production tasks. Judging from the production situation in April, only a few units completed the planned value and output. The state of being relaxed at the beginning and tense at the end of production is still common. Individual factory leaders have not paid attention to grasping and solving key problems in production, and often pin their hopes on "crash" efforts in the next month or quarter to complete this month's production tasks with the greatest determination. The meeting pointed out that the discussion of the national plan is to better complete and overfulfill the national plan, and that the so-called completion of the national plan refers to the comprehensive completion of various indicators such as value, output, quality, cost, and finance on a monthly and quarterly basis. Therefore, the significance of "grasping the plan" is not only to mobilize the masses to discuss the plan, but also to strengthen planning management on this basis and complete the plan on a monthly basis. In future discussions of the national plan, each unit must clearly divide labor, lead daily production work, and ensure the completion of production tasks. Another important issue is that the political work of each unit is still far behind the current production work. Recently, production accidents have continued to occur in many units, absenteeism has increased, and labor discipline has been relaxed. This phenomenon should be corrected quickly. Each unit must promptly unite the forces of the Party, government, labor union, and youth league, strengthen political work, strengthen political and ideological education for employees, commend advanced figures and advanced ideas, and criticize non-working-class ideologies and behaviors, in order to correctly promote democracy and implement the mass line. In this regard, the Party committees of each unit should formulate plans based on the central tasks of the enterprise, lead the Party, government, labor union, and youth league to formulate plans, and conduct regular inspections.
    Regarding the discussion of the national plan and the work of combining it with production reform, Comrade Xu Jianlou of the Industry Department pointed out that in the preparation work, it is first necessary to organize the study of the significance and indicators of the national plan with sufficient time, especially to organize the study of advanced experience in planning management among cadres, so as to clarify the thinking and unify the steps from top to bottom. The Party, government, labor union, and youth league must also clarify their goals and unify their forces. At present, some units are only engaging in it administratively, and the Party, labor union, and youth league have not acted well. Secondly, before discussing the plan, the leaders must conduct careful research and analysis on all aspects of the enterprise, identify the key to the problem and the potential for production. When the masses discuss the plan, the leadership should transform the national indicators into specific indicators for workshops and teams, so that the masses have a basis for revising quotas. At the same time, it should closely cooperate with political work, promptly establish advanced role models, so that employees clearly recognize the consistency of national interests and personal interests, thereby breaking down conservative ideas, finding shortcuts and tapping potential around key issues, putting forward rationalization proposals, and setting advanced quotas and overproduction targets. On the basis of extensively mobilizing the masses, special attention should be paid to mobilizing veteran workers, mobilizing advanced producers to drive backward producers, and organizing technical personnel to go to workshops purposefully and systematically. Competitions can also be launched in a targeted and step-by-step manner in the discussion of the national plan, depending on the different situations of each unit.

### 中共江苏省委工业部检查讨论计划的工作  讨论计划工作没有和当前生产任务结合起来是一大缺点

    中共江苏省委工业部检查讨论计划的工作
    讨论计划工作没有和当前生产任务结合起来是一大缺点
    中共江苏省委员会工业部于五月底，召集部分工厂企业负责干部举行会议，检查讨论国家计划的工作。到会的有国营南京机器厂、戚墅堰机车车辆修理工厂、南京有线电厂、无线电厂、五一一厂、五一三厂、汽车修配厂、南京铁路分局、南京电业管理局及公私合营永利寗厂等八个厂两个局的党、政负责人。会上各厂、局汇报了四月份生产情况，并由南京机器厂、戚墅堰机车车辆修理工厂及永利寗厂分别介绍了他们在讨论国家计划中的有关准备工作及发动群众制订先进指标等经验。
    就各厂局汇报的情况来看，最近各单位虽然对国家计划有了进一步的认识，并在贯彻计划工作上有了初步成绩，但最大的缺点是，未把讨论计划与完成当前生产任务密切地结合起来。就四月份生产情况来看，完成产值、产量计划的只有少数单位，生产上前松后紧的状态还普遍存在，个别工厂领导上尚未注意掌握和解决生产中的关键问题，用最大决心来完成本月生产任务，往往把希望寄托在下月、下季的“突击”。会议指出：讨论国家计划是为了更好地完成与超额完成国家计划，而所谓完成国家计划是指按月按季全面地完成产值、产量、质量、成本、财务等各项指标。因此“抓计划”的意义就不仅仅在于发动群众讨论计划，而且要求在这一基础上加强计划管理，按月完成计划。在今后讨论国家计划工作中，各单位要明确分工，领导日常生产工作，保证生产任务的完成。另一个重要问题，就是目前各单位的政治工作还远远落后于当前生产工作。最近，很多单位仍不断发生生产事故，缺勤率增高，劳动纪律松懈。这一现象应迅速纠正。各单位必须及时把党、政、工、团的力量统一起来，加强政治工作，加强对职工群众的政治思想教育，表扬先进人物与先进思想，批判非工人阶级的思想行为，以正确地发扬民主和贯彻群众路线。在这方面，各单位党委应根据企业的中心任务，领导党、政、工、团订出计划来，并定期加以检查。
    对于讨论国家计划并结合进行生产改革的工作，工业部徐建楼同志指出：在准备工作中，首先要以充分时间组织关于国家计划意义和指标的学习，特别是在干部中组织关于计划管理先进经验的学习，这样才能使上下思想明确，步调一致。党、政、工、团也要明确目标，统一力量。目前有的单位只是由行政上去搞，党、工会、青年团还没有很好地行动起来。其次在讨论计划之前，领导上必须对本企业各方面的情况进行细致的研究、分析，找出问题的关键和生产潜力所在。在群众讨论计划时，领导方面应把国家指标变为车间小组的具体指标，使群众修改定额时有所依据。同时，应紧密配合政治工作，及时地树立先进榜样，使职工明确认识国家利益与个人利益的一致性，从而打破保守思想，围绕关键问题，找窍门，挖潜力，提出合理化建议，订出先进的定额和超产指标。在广泛发动群众的基础上，应特别注意发动老工人，发动先进生产者带动落后生产者，组织技术人员有目的有计划地下车间。并可在讨论国家计划中，根据各单位不同的情况有目标有步骤地开展竞赛。
