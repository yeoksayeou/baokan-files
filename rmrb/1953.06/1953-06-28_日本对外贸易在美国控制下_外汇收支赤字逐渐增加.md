Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 26: Due to the continuous shrinkage of foreign trade, Japan's foreign exchange deficit is gradually increasing this year.

According to statistics from the Bank of Japan, Japan's overall foreign exchange balance continued to show a deficit in May. Total foreign exchange income in May was $172 million, while total foreign exchange expenditure was $208 million, resulting in a deficit of $36 million.

The fundamental reason for Japan's foreign exchange deficit is that Japan's foreign trade continues to decline under the control of the United States and the competition from Britain, resulting in a huge trade deficit. Statistics from the Bank of Japan show that Japan's foreign exchange earnings from export trade in May were only $89 million, a decrease of more than $5.16 million compared with April. On the other hand, Japan's foreign exchange payments for imports in May remained at more than $190 million. Therefore, the foreign exchange deficit caused by the trade deficit in May reached more than $103.62 million. This is the highest monthly trade deficit record in Japan since March 1951. The Bank of Japan said that the main reasons for the contraction of Japanese exports are the reduction of Japanese exports to the Sterling Area and the United States, and the reduction of shipbuilding income.

Since the outbreak of the Korean War, Japan has mainly relied on U.S. military orders (the so-called "special procurements") to make up for the deficit caused by its huge trade deficit. However, the continuous decline in Japanese exports has gradually made the amount of trade deficit exceed the income from "invisible trade" dominated by U.S. military orders, deepening the crisis of Japan's increasingly militarized and colonialized economy. From the beginning of this year to the end of May, the deficit in Japan's total foreign exchange balance has reached $114 million. In May last year, Japan's foreign exchange balance had a surplus of more than $91 million, and the total surplus in the first half of last year was $247 million.

Regarding the bleak prospects for Japan's trade and foreign exchange balance, U.S. Ambassador to Japan Allison revealed on the 23rd that in the 1953 fiscal year, Japan's trade deficit may reach $1.15 billion. He admitted: "This deficit certainly exceeds the income expected from U.S. special procurement orders, and will reduce (Japan's) foreign exchange reserves by approximately $350 million."

### 日本对外贸易在美国控制下  外汇收支赤字逐渐增加

    日本对外贸易在美国控制下
    外汇收支赤字逐渐增加
    【新华社二十六日讯】东京消息：由于对外贸易的不断萎缩，今年日本的外汇收支的赤字正在逐渐增加。
    据日本银行的统计，日本整个的外汇收支，在五月份继续有逆差。五月份的全部外汇收入是一亿七千二百多万美元，全部外汇支出是二亿零八百多万美元，因此产生赤字三千六百多万美元。
    日本外汇收支逆差的根本原因是：日本的对外贸易在美国的控制和英国的竞争之下，继续衰退，产生巨额入超。日本银行的统计表明，日本五月份的出口贸易所得的外汇仅有八千九百多万美元，比四月份又减少了五百十六万多美元。另一方面，五月份日本为进口而支付的外汇依然有一亿九千多万美元。因此，五月份对外贸易入超所造成的外汇赤字达一亿零三百六十二万多美元。这是自一九五一年三月以来日本每月入超的最高记录。日本银行说，日本出口萎缩的主要原因是：日本对英镑区和对美国的输出缩减，造船的收入也减少了。
    自从朝鲜战争爆发以来，日本主要依靠美国的军事订货（所谓“特需”）来弥补它的巨额贸易入超所造成的赤字。但是，日本出口的不断下降，已经逐渐使入超的数额超过以美国军事订货为主的“无形贸易”的收入，加深了日益军事化和殖民地化的日本经济的危机。自今年年初到五月底为止，日本全部外汇收支的赤字已达一亿一千四百万美元。去年五月份日本的外汇收支是盈余九千一百多万美元，去年上半年总计起来也是盈余二亿四千七百万美元。
    对于日本贸易和外汇收支的黯淡前景，美国驻日大使艾利逊在二十三日透露，在一九五三会计年度中，日本的贸易赤字或许将达到十一亿五千万美元。他承认：“这个赤字当然超过预料可从美国特需订货中所获得的收入，并将使（日本的）外汇储备约减少三亿五千万美元”。
