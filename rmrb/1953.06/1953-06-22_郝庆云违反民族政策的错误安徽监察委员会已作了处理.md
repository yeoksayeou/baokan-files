    Hao Qingyun’s Mistake in Violating Ethnic Policies Has Been Dealt With by the Anhui Supervisory Committee

    A letter from the People's Correspondence Group of the General Office of the Ethnic Affairs Commission of the Central People's Government: The "Summary of Readers' Letters" column on February 26 published our letter regarding "Respecting the Living Habits of Ethnic Minorities." It mentioned that Hao Qingyun, deputy director of the Jiaopo Farm in Mahewan, Feixi County, Anhui Province, and a certain Zhu surnamed section chief of the Yilan County People's Government in Songjiang Province, had violated ethnic policies. We are now informing you of the handling results of the above two matters:

    Hao Qingyun, deputy director of Jiaopo Farm, violated ethnic policies by arbitrarily occupying the Hui Muslim mosque as an office, building a pigsty in the mosque, and eating pork. The Anhui Provincial People's Supervisory Committee has taken the following actions: 1. Convene a Hui Muslim conference, where relevant personnel made public self-criticisms; and give Hao Qingyun a demerit. 2. The farm office was moved out of the mosque; the pigsty was demolished, the water room was repaired, and all original equipment in the mosque was restored. 3. Cai Shensi, the former section chief of the Agricultural Construction Section of the Feixi County People's Government, arbitrarily designated the mosque as a place to stay when making the farm construction plan, and the county magistrate of the county failed to review the plan; they were ordered to make written self-criticisms. The East China Administrative Committee People's Supervisory Committee has also notified the People's Governments and People's Supervisory Organs in various parts of East China of this matter and its handling results to draw attention. After the handling, the Hui Muslims felt deeply satisfied and grateful for the care of the People's Government.

    Regarding the issue of a certain Zhu surnamed section chief of the Yilan County People's Government threatening local Hui Muslims to abolish the mosque, after investigation, it was found that there were some discrepancies with the facts. There were originally two mosques in Yilan County, one in the urban area and one in Dong Sanjiazi Village in the fifth district. When Zhu Shide, the section chief of the Civil Affairs Section of the county, was studying the issue of hiring imams for the mosque in Dong Sanjiazi Village with the village chief Liu Zhenxiang, he said casually, "Can the mosques be merged?" because he was neither familiar with nor paid enough attention to the customs of ethnic minorities. This caused concern among some Hui Muslims. The county People's Government convened a symposium attended by Hui Muslim representatives, where Comrade Zhu Shide made a self-criticism and said that he would strengthen his study of ethnic policies in the future to improve his work. The concerns of the Hui Muslims have been basically eliminated.

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    郝庆云违反民族政策的错误安徽监察委员会已作了处理
    中央人民政府民族事务委员会办公厅人民来信组来信：二月二十六日“读者来信摘要”栏刊出了我们关于“应该尊重少数民族人民的生活习惯”的来信。其中提到安徽省肥西县马河湾焦婆农场副场长郝庆云及松江省依兰县人民政府某朱姓科长违反民族政策的问题，现将上述两事的处理结果告诉你们：
    焦婆农场副场长郝庆云违反民族政策，任意占用回民清真寺做办公室，并在寺内筑猪圈、吃猪肉。此事已由安徽省人民政府人民监察委员会作了如下处理：一，召开回民大会，由有关人员当众检讨；并给郝庆云以记过处分。二，该农场办公室迁出清真寺；拆毁猪圈，修复水房，并恢复寺内一切原有设备。三，肥西县人民政府农建科前科长蔡慎思在造农场建场计划时擅自指定借住清真寺，该县县长对该计划未加审查；责令他们作书面检讨。华东行政委员会人民监察委员会并已将此事及其处理结果通报华东区各地人民政府及人民监察机关，以引起注意。经处理后，回民深感满意，并感激人民政府对他们的关怀。
    关于依兰县人民政府某朱姓科长威胁当地回民群众要撤消清真寺的问题，经了解与事实有些出入。依兰县原有两处清真寺，一在城区，一在五区东三家子村。该县民政科科长朱世德在与东三家子村村长刘振祥研究该村清真寺聘阿訇问题时，因对少数民族风俗习惯既不熟悉，又不够重视，就信口说： “清真寺是否可以合并？”这使某些回民群众发生顾虑。该县人民政府召开了有回民代表参加的座谈会，朱世德同志在会上作了检讨，并表示今后加强学习民族政策，以改进工作。回民的顾虑已基本消除。
