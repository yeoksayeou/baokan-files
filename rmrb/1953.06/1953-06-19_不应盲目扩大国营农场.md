    State-Owned Farms Should Not Be Blindly Expanded

    Our country is now establishing state-owned farms to demonstrate increased production to farmers, unite and guide the peasant masses to advance with us, accumulate advanced agricultural experience, train cadres to manage agriculture scientifically, and prepare for the further development of agriculture and the transformation of small-scale agriculture into large-scale agriculture in the future. The blind expansion of state-owned farms in some areas and the forced exchange of land with farmers directly violate this policy. The result of their actions is not to unite the masses but to infringe upon the interests of the peasants, alienating the masses from us. Their approach is not to lead and influence the masses to increase production but to severely undermine the farmers' enthusiasm for production. Instead of demonstrating advanced management methods and technical experience to the masses, they cultivate crops poorly because they have too much land and cannot take care of it properly.
    The main reason for this phenomenon is that the leading cadres of these farms and the relevant leading organs have not earnestly implemented or correctly understood the current policy of running state-owned farms and have neglected the policies of the Party and the People's Government regarding agricultural production and rural work. They do not consider the current practical needs, nor do they take into account the current possible conditions, but proceed from the subjective desire of "the bigger, the better," blindly expanding the area of ​​the farm, causing many adverse consequences. Last year, the state-owned farm in Yiwu County, Zhejiang Province, already had more than 100 mu of paddy fields and nearly 60 mu of dry land; for a county farm, the cultivated area was already not small. The yield of most crops on the farm last year was lower than that of local farmers, but this year it has blindly expanded by more than 100 mu of cultivated land. Eighty percent of the rice seedlings they planted rotted, which was far inferior to the rice seedlings cultivated by local farmers. The situation of blindly expanding state-owned farms has been discovered to varying degrees in many places in other provinces. This not only loses the practical significance of running state-owned local farms but also poses a serious danger of being divorced from the masses, which should be corrected immediately.
    Some people say that expanding state-owned farms is to expand the effect of demonstration. However, the effect of blind expansion is often counterproductive. State-owned farms must not rely on empty, ostentatious "large scale" to "demonstrate," but should concentrate their efforts on managing the existing land well, demonstrating with effective advanced technologies, and demonstrating with higher yields per unit area. Some leading organs attempt to increase a portion of fiscal revenue through state-owned farms and therefore arbitrarily expand the farms, which is also wrong and unrealistic. In order to increase agricultural products, in the next few years, we can only rely on organized farmers and individual farmers. Without the production enthusiasm of the broad masses of peasants, it is impossible to smoothly achieve the task of increasing agricultural production. Of course, when we run state-owned farms, we must strive to operate them well, never lose money, and strive for a surplus. However, the main purpose of doing so, at present, is still to demonstrate to the masses so that the masses recognize the superiority of advanced agriculture, rather than relying on state-owned farms to increase the state's fiscal revenue.
    The Henan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has already taken appropriate measures to correct the tendency to blindly expand state-owned farms, which is very correct. When dealing with this issue, make sure that the peasants do not suffer losses and give appropriate compensation to the peasants who have suffered losses. Some state-owned farms are inconvenient to operate because they have too little land, and there is no extra land to expand. It may be considered to shut them down. In areas where there is no suitable land, do not establish new farms for the time being. In the future, newly established state-owned mechanized farms can only develop towards reclaimable wasteland. Existing mechanized farms that must adjust their land to facilitate mechanized farming should first formulate proper methods to ensure that the peasants do not suffer losses, and they must be approved by the local party and government leading organs in advance, and then fully discussed and explained among the masses to truly obtain the consent of the peasants before starting. Any tendency of blind advancement is not allowed.

### 不应盲目扩大国营农场

    不应盲目扩大国营农场
    我们国家现在举办国营农场，是为了向农民进行增产示范，团结和引导农民群众和我们一起前进，积累先进的农业经验，培养科学地经营管理农业的干部，为将来农业的进一步发展、变小农业为大农业作准备工作。部分地区盲目扩大国营农场，强制农民调换土地，是直接违背这个方针的。他们这样做的结果，不能团结群众，而是侵犯了农民的利益，使群众疏远我们；他们的做法不是领导和影响群众增产，而是严重地打击了农民的生产积极性；他们不是以先进的经营方法和技术经验向群众示范，反而因为土地多了照顾不好而把庄稼种得很坏。
    产生这种现象的主要原因，是这些农场的领导干部和有关的领导机关没有认真执行或没有正确了解当前举办国营农场的方针，而且忽视了党和人民政府关于农业生产和农村工作的政策。他们既不考虑当前的实际需要，也不顾及当前的可能条件，就从“越大越好”的主观愿望出发，盲目扩大农场面积，引起许多不良的后果。浙江义乌县农场去年已有水田一百多亩，旱地近六十亩；就一个县农场来说，耕地面积已经不算很小了。该场去年绝大部分作物的产量比当地农民的产量还低，但今年又盲目地扩大了一百多亩耕地。他们种的稻秧烂了百分之八十，远不如当地农民培育的稻秧好。这样盲目扩大国营农场的情况，在其他省份的不少地方也都程度不同地被发现了。这不但失去了办国营地方农场的实际意义，而且有严重地脱离群众的危险，这是应当立即纠正的。
    有些人说，扩大国营农场是为了扩大示范的效果。但盲目扩大的效果常常适得其反。国营农场决不能靠空洞的虚有其表的“大规模”来“示范”，而应集中力量把现有的土地经营好，用行之有效的先进的技术来示范，用较高的单位面积产量来示范。有些领导机关企图靠国营农场增加一部分财政收入，因此就随意扩大农场，这也是错误的、不切实际的。为了增加农业产品，在今后若干年内，只能依靠组织起来的农民和个体农民。没有广大农民的生产积极性，要顺利地实现提高农业生产的任务是不可能的。当然，我们举办国营农场，要力求经营得好，绝不能赔钱，并应争取有盈余。但这样做的主要目的，在目前来说，还是向群众示范，使群众认识先进的农业的优越性，而不是靠国营农场来增加国家的财政收入。
    中共河南省委已经采取了适当的措施，纠正盲目扩大国营农场的偏向，这是十分正确的。在处理这个问题时，务使农民不受损失；并对已遭受损失的农民给予适当的补偿。有些国营农场因为土地太少不便经营，而又没有多余的土地足以扩充，可以考虑停办。在没有适当的土地的地区，暂时不要举办新的农场。今后新办国营机耕农场，只能向可垦的荒地发展。已有的机耕农场必须调整土地才利于机耕作业的，应当先定出妥善的办法，保证不使农民吃亏，并且要事先经过当地党政领导机关批准，然后在群众当中进行充分的酝酿和解释，真正取得农民同意以后，才能着手。任何盲目冒进的倾向都是不能容许的。
