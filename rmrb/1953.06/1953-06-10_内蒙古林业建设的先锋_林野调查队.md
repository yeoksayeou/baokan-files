The Forest Survey Team, belonging to the Forestry Department of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region People's Government, began surveying the Greater Khingan Range, once known as the "Sea of Trees," four years ago. At that time, there were only eight surveyors who only knew how to use simple survey methods. Now, this survey team has grown into a team of two hundred people who have mastered the advanced Soviet survey methods. Over the past few years, they have left their footprints on the frozen high mountains, beside the rushing rivers, and in the boundless wilderness. So far, they have completed surveys of forest resources, forest management, logging areas, and afforestation shelterbelts covering ten million hectares.

This is no easy task. In the spring of 1950, when surveying the Sanhe Forest Area, survey team members often braved rain and snow, climbing mountains and crossing ridges. Rain and sweat often soaked their clothes. When they encountered steep mountains where it was impossible to get a foothold, they used shovels to dig soil into steps, crawling up one level at a time. They finally climbed to the more than 2,000-meter-high Amit Peak. On that high peak with thin air, they felt their hands and feet were numb and their breathing was rapid; however, they thought that if they did not endure this hardship, they would not be able to find out the forest distribution, so these difficulties were overcome. In the spring of 1951, they conducted surveys in the sparsely populated upper reaches of the Gan River and Nen River. It was difficult to find a guide to enter the dense forest area of Hong'a. At this time, they met the Oroqen people who lived in this area. At first, they did not dare to approach the survey team, but after the survey team members explained their intentions to them in the Mongolian language, they warmly gave the survey team directions and also sent the survey team a lot of venison and wild boar meat. In 1952, when surveying the Gen River and Yituli River forest areas, even a small area of sparse forest was precisely measured. Their faces were frostbitten, their feet were worn out, and their hands were pricked, but no one complained.

In 1951 and 1952, the survey team completed the area survey and design of afforestation shelterbelts in fourteen banners and counties in the three leagues of Jerim, Ju Ud and Hinggan. Conducting survey and design in this wilderness and desert area is as difficult as surveying the rich resources of the motherland in the deep mountains and ridges. There are no fixed roads, only following the hoof prints of livestock. Every day they encountered strong winds, and the surveyors' eyes were often streaming with tears. However, they knew that their work was closely related to the lives of the broad masses of working people, so they completed their tasks without fear of any hardship.

They also persisted in studying during their hard work. They regularly made study plans and often held quizzes to select models. Team members launched a wave of enthusiasm for learning professional skills, especially learning advanced Soviet survey methods. Now, more than half of the team members have mastered this advanced method.

In 1952, the work efficiency of the entire team increased by one and a half times compared to the past. Surveyor Ao Changling (Mongolian) had little education in the past. He insisted on studying until midnight every night. Therefore, in just a few months, he changed from a layman to an expert.

In the past few years of work and study, they have created many advanced work methods. For example, the "Tributary Watershed Reverse Survey Method" created by Zhang Tiehan increased work efficiency by one time compared to the past mainline measurement method. The shelterbelt survey team collectively created the "Banner Transfer Point Selection Method" and the "One-Sided Measurement Method," which not only improved work efficiency but also saved a lot of manpower and financial resources.

Now, this team is marching towards the northernmost end of the Greater Khingan Range – the Niu'er River Forest Area and the Qigan Forest Area. The forest resources owned by the Greater Khingan Range, with an area of approximately 20 million hectares, will be successively utilized for the motherland's large-scale economic construction.

    内蒙古林业建设的先锋——林野调查队
    王继先
    内蒙古自治区人民政府林业部所属的林野调查队，在四年前就开始到一向被人称为“树海”的大兴安岭进行调查了。当时调查人员只有八名，只会使用简易的调查方法。现在这个调查队已发展成拥有二百人、掌握了苏联的先进调查法的队伍。几年来，他们在冰封的高山上，在奔腾的河川旁，在无垠的旷野里，都留下了自己的足迹。到现在为止，他们已经完成了森林资源、森林经营、伐区调查和包括一千万垧的营造防护林带的调查。
    这是多么不容易的事啊。一九五零年春季调查三河林区的时候，调查队员们经常冒着雨雪，爬山越岭，雨水和汗水常常浸透了他们的衣服。他们遇到根本没法踏脚的陡山，就用铁锹掘土成梯，一级一级地匍匐而上。他们终于爬上了二千多公尺的阿米特高峰。在那空气稀薄的高峰上，他们感到手脚麻木，呼吸迫促；但是，他们想到如果不忍受这点困苦，就无法弄清森林分布情况，这些困难就被战胜了。一九五一年春天，他们在人迹稀少的甘河、嫩江上游调查。进入密林区的红阿，很难找到向导。这时候遇到了深居在这一带的鄂伦春族人民。他们最初不敢接近调查队，但经过调查队员用蒙族语言向他们解说了来意，他们便热情地给调查队指示道路，还送给调查队许多鹿肉和野猪肉。一九五二年调查根河、伊图里河林区时，那怕是一块小小的疎林都经过了精密的测量。他们的脸冻坏了，脚走破了，手刺伤了，但没有一个人发出怨言。
    调查队在一九五一年和一九五二年完成了哲里木、昭乌达和兴安三个盟、十四个旗县的营造防护林带面积勘测工作。在这荒野和沙漠地带进行勘测设计，和在深山峻岭勘测祖国富源时所遇到的困难是一样的。没有一定的道路，只按照牲畜踏过的蹄痕前进。每天都遇着大风，调查员们的两眼经常泪流不止。可是他们知道自己的工作和广大劳动人民的生活是息息相关的，因此就不怕任何艰苦地完成了任务。
    他们在艰苦的工作中还坚持了学习，他们照常订出学习计划，还经常举行测验评选模范。队员们掀起了学习业务，特别是学习苏联先进调查法的热潮。现在已有半数以上的队员掌握了这个先进方法，
    一九五二年全队的工作效率比以前提高了一倍半。调查员敖长令（蒙族）过去念书很少，他每天晚间坚持学习到半夜，因此，在短短几个月内由外行变成了内行。
    在这几年的工作和学习中，他们创造出不少的先进工作法。如张铁汉创造的“支流分水岭反测法”，比过去用主线测量法提高工作效率一倍。防护林带调查队集体创作了“传旗选点法”和“一面测量法”，不仅使工作效率提高，而且节省了大量的人力和财力。
    现在这一支队伍又向大兴安岭的最北端——牛耳河林区、奇干林区进军了。面积约在二千多万垧的大兴安岭所拥有的森林富源，将陆续被利用到祖国大规模的经济建设上去。
