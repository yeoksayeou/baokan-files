Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, June 10th: TASS Moscow, June 8th: Today, "Pravda's" international commentary column published an article by Oliekhov discussing the prospects for Britain's expanding exports to the United States.

The article wrote: Certain British exporters interested in expanding trade have long hoped to gain more free access to the American market. This hope of British exporters illustrates at least two things:

(1) This shows that Britain's need for markets has greatly increased.

(2) Some business people in Britain still have illusions about the United States.

As British newspapers have pointed out, these illusions have now been quickly shattered. Hardly a day goes by without British newspapers and magazines publishing articles or news reports explaining that there is less and less hope for the United States to lower tariff barriers. Furthermore, British business people are increasingly worried that the door to the American market will be closed even more tightly. At the beginning of last year, the United States made promises of reducing tariffs, which generated a lot of hope, but no actual action has been seen to this day. This is the first reason for the shattering of British exporters' illusions. The subsequent actions of the U.S. government have supported increasing, rather than relaxing, American tariffs.

The United States has not even tried to discuss proposals that would benefit British exporters. On the contrary, what has been discussed are measures to strengthen trade barriers. These measures are said to be offset by the president's "compromise" proposal, which is to extend the current Reciprocal Trade Act, which expires on June 12, for another year. Oliekhov pointed out that if Congress passes this proposal, it would, at best, only maintain the status quo. However, the reason the president made this proposal is precisely because powerful business people in the United States are unwilling to open the door to the American market.

Oliekhov quoted some rather depressing predictions made by certain British and American newspapers in this regard. He said that British business people now remember that in the early post-war years, even in 1948, when Britain was not yet considered a strong competitor, the Americans opposed reducing tariffs.

Life itself has led British exporters to the conclusion that now, when Britain is putting forward the slogan of "Trade, not Aid!" and is in unprecedented need of markets, its partner has no intention of allowing it into the American market.

Xinhua News Agency, June 8th: TASS Moscow, June 5th: Mileikovsky, under the title "Absurd Prescription," wrote an article in "Izvestia" commenting on the new American plan for "aid" to Western Europe.

Western European business circles have learned from their bitter experience that American "aid" makes them more financially dependent on the United States, causes long-term balance of payments deficits, and damages the stability of their own currencies. Therefore, after British Chancellor of the Exchequer Butler put forward the slogan of "Trade, not Aid," all the Marshallized countries, whose necks were tightly gripped by American monopoly capital and banks and who were heavily indebted, immediately responded.

If European capitalist countries cannot be satisfied with American "aid" and demand trade—that is, demand markets for their goods—then where they will get dollars has become an open question.

American big businessmen are trying to give this question an answer. One of them is William Draper, who until recently was the special representative of the so-called "Mutual Security Agency." Recently, "U.S. News & World Report" magazine published an interview with Draper, explaining that the "new" plan of American monopoly capitalists is to provide Western Europe with dollars in exchange for their arms exports, and to have American private capital make investments.

Draper said that in the next two or three years, foreign contracts—that is, the United States purchasing weapons in Europe—will turn aid into trade.

Mileikovsky pointed out: In this way, Western European countries become auxiliary workshops for the main armories of the United States. They will not earn money by exporting daily necessities, but by exporting weapons.

Mileikovsky said: It is obvious that the intention of American monopoly capitalists in urging their Western European partners to agree to this plan is to prepare the way for driving them out of the capitalist world market in the future. Increasing American private investment in Western European countries and their colonies is said to be another way for Draper to solve the dollar problem for Western European countries. It is obvious that the purpose of this method is to weaken and enslave America's competitors, so that American monopoly capital can earn maximum profits.

Until now, American monopoly capitalists have insisted on letting the government invest in Western Europe, because after the enslaving loans and "aid" allocations are released, they will soon fall into the hands of monopoly capital and banks as payments for purchasing outdated goods and obsolete weapons.

Today, when this old method of "aid" is clearly not working in Western Europe, the American ruling clique is advising monopoly capitalists to give Western European countries dollar "aid" in the form of private investment. Therefore, Draper requires Western European governments to take measures to ensure that American capitalists are not subject to devaluation losses.

He is also concerned about not letting American monopoly capitalists risk the danger of their enterprises being nationalized when investing in Western Europe.

Mileikovsky concluded: The "new methods" proposed by the United States on the issue of mutual relations in the capitalist world market are nothing more than a continuation of the old policy, the purpose of which is to destroy and weaken its opponents, seize their markets and raw material resources, in order to establish the world economic hegemony of American monopoly capital.

### “真理报”发表专文指出  英国出口商扩大对美输出的幻想已经破灭  “消息报”载文评论美国垄断资本家“援助”西欧的新花样

    “真理报”发表专文指出
    英国出口商扩大对美输出的幻想已经破灭
    “消息报”载文评论美国垄断资本家“援助”西欧的新花样
    【新华社十日讯】塔斯社莫斯科八日讯：今天“真理报”国际述评栏刊载了奥列霍夫的一篇文章，论述英国扩大对美国输出的前途。
    文章写道：某些对扩充贸易有兴趣的英国出口商长久以来一直希望能够比较自由地进入美国市场。英国出口商的这种希望至少说明两件事情：
    （一）这说明英国需要市场的程度已经大为增加；
    （二）英国的某些企业界人士对美国还有幻想。
    如英国报纸所指出，这些幻想现在已迅速破灭。英国报章杂志没有一天不刊载文章或消息，说明美国降低关税壁垒的希望越来越少。此外，英国企业界人士越来越担心美国市场的大门会更加紧紧地关闭起来。去年年初，美国提出减低关税的诺言令人产生了不少希望，可是至今还没看到实际行动。这是使得英国出口商幻想破灭的第一个原因。而美国政府随后的行动是支持增加而不是放宽美国的关税。
    美国甚至并没有设法来讨论对英国出口商有利的建议。相反的，所讨论的倒是一些加强贸易壁垒的措施。这些措施据说被总统的“折衷”建议所抵销了，这项折衷建议就是把到六月十二日满期的目前的互惠贸易法延长一年。奥列霍夫指出，假如国会通过这个建议，充其量也不过是保持现状。但是，总统之所以提出这个建议，正是因为美国有势力的企业界人士不愿意开放美国市场的大门。
    奥列霍夫引述了某些英美报纸在这方面所作的相当沮丧的预测。他说，英国企业界人士现在记起，早在战后头几年，甚至在一九四八年的时候，英国还没有被认为是一个竞争的劲敌，可是美国人就反对减低关税。
    生活本身使英国出口商得到这样的结论：现在当英国提出“要贸易，不要援助！”的口号并空前需要市场的时候，它的伙伴却丝毫没有让它进入美国市场的意思。
    【新华社八日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科五日讯：米列科夫斯基以“荒谬的药方”为题，在“消息报”上撰文评论美国“援助”西欧的新计划。
    西欧商业界从它们惨痛的经验中认识到，美国的
    “援助”使得他们在财政上更加依赖美国，并造成长期的支付逆差，损害了它们本国货币的稳定性。因此，在英国财政大臣巴特勒提出“要贸易，不要援助”的口号以后，所有被美国垄断资本和银行紧勒着脖子、负债累累的马歇尔化国家便立刻响应。
    欧洲资本主义国家如果不能以美“援”为满足，而要求贸易——即为它们的商品要求市场——那么，它们将从哪里得到美元已成为一个公开的疑问了。
    美国大商人试图给这个问题一个答复。其中之一就是威廉·德莱柏，他不久以前还是所谓“共同安全署”的特别代表。最近“美国新闻与世界报道”杂志刊登了一篇德莱柏的访问记，说明了美国垄断资本家的“新”计划是：供给西欧美元以换取它们的武器输出，并由美国私人资本进行投资。
    德莱柏说，在今后两三年内，国外的合同——那就是美国在欧洲购买武器——将使援助变为贸易。
    米列科夫斯基指出：这样，西欧国家就变成美国主要兵工厂的辅助工场，它们将不靠输出日常需要的商品来赚钱，而是以输出武器来赚钱了。
    米列科夫斯基说：很明显，美国垄断资本家所以促使他们的西欧伙伴们同意这个计划，其用意是准备为将来把它们赶出资本主义世界市场开辟道路。增加美国在西欧国家及其殖民地的私人投资，据说是德莱柏的另一个解决西欧国家美元问题的办法。很明显，这一办法的目的就是削弱并奴役美国的竞争对手，以便使得美国垄断资本赚取最大限度的利润。
    至今为止，美国垄断资本家一直主张让政府去向西欧投资，因为奴役性的借款和“援助”的拨款放出来以后，不多久又会作为购买陈旧的商品和过时的武器的付款而落入垄断资本和银行的手中。
    今天，当这种旧的“援助”办法在西欧显然已经吃不开的时候，美国统治集团便劝告垄断资本家用私人投资的形式给西欧国家以美元“援助”。因此，德莱柏要求西欧各国政府采取措施，保证美国资本家不受贬值的损失。
    他也关怀到不让美国垄断资本家在西欧投资冒他们的企业可能被收归国有的危险。
    米列科夫斯基最后说：美国在资本主义世界市场相互关系问题上所提出的“新办法”不过是老政策的继续罢了，其目的是要摧毁并削弱他们的对手、攫取他们的市场和原料资源，以建立美国垄断资本的世界经济霸权。
