Xinhua News Agency, June 4th. Tokyo dispatch: The Central Guidance Department of the Japanese Communist Party issued a statement on the day the Fifth Yoshida Cabinet was formed (May 21), calling on the Japanese people to overthrow the pro-US Yoshida government and launch a struggle to establish a people's government.

The statement first pointed out that the Fifth Yoshida Cabinet was formed amidst the curses of the working class and the anger of the people across the country, and to the cheers of the United States and reactionaries. This Yoshida Cabinet attempts to forcibly implement rearmament, "enterprise rationalization," and fascist policies.

The people across the country only need to look at the list of ministers selected by the Yoshida Cabinet to understand. These people are war criminals at the level of traitors, with their hands stained with the blood of the Japanese, Korean, and Chinese people. The Japanese people are absolutely unwilling to hand over the country's politics to such a government for a long time. The life of this government will be very short. The Fifth Yoshida pro-US reactionary government attempts to pass bills on amending the Police Law, a ban on strikes, and a reactionary bill to provide pensions to former soldiers in this short period.

The statement called on the people across the country to immediately launch a struggle against the Yoshida government under the leadership of the working class. The statement said that the struggle of the working class will be manifested in strikes in various places. In June, a wave of strikes will spread across the country. The movement of industrial and commercial circles demanding Japan-China and Japan-Soviet trade to overcome the economic recession will become stronger than before. The struggle against colonialism and against militarist fascism will develop into a struggle to strike at the foundation of the ruling power of the Japanese ruling class and even the American occupiers.

The statement emphasized that the Japanese Communist Party will stand at the forefront of the people's struggle, do its utmost for the people with loyalty, and fulfill the task of the party as the vanguard of the Japanese working class.

The statement finally called for the overthrow of the Fifth Yoshida pro-US government and the establishment of a new unified people's government.

Xinhua News Agency, June 4th. Tokyo dispatch: The General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo), the largest trade union organization in Japan with approximately three million members, announced on the 2nd that the Sohyo Executive Committee had passed a draft action plan for Sohyo for the next year on the 1st. The draft declared that Sohyo will smash obstacles to peace in the struggle for peace in the future. The draft also strongly criticized Wall Street and monopoly capital in Japan and other countries for deliberately obstructing peace and attempting to continue arms production.

In this draft, Sohyo reiterated its determination to launch a movement to demand wage increases.

    日共号召日本人民打倒吉田卖国政府
    “总评”执委会通过争取和平的行动计划草案
    【新华社四日讯】东京消息：日本共产党中央指导部在第五届吉田内阁成立的当天（五月二十一日）发表声明，号召日本人民打倒吉田卖国政府，展开建立人民政府的斗争。
    声明首先指出：第五届吉田内阁是在工人阶级的诅咒和全国人民的怒骂中，在美国和反动派的欢呼中成立的。这一届吉田内阁试图强制实行重整军备、“企业合理化”和法西斯政策。
    全国人民只要看看吉田内阁所选出的大臣名单，就可以明白。这些人都是两手沾满了日本、朝鲜和中国人民的血迹的战犯一级的卖国罪人。日本人民绝不愿把国家政治长期的交给这样的政府。这个政府的寿命必将是非常短促的。第五届吉田卖国反动政府企图在这短短的时期内通过关于修改警察法的法案，通过禁止罢工法和反动的发给旧军人以年金的法案。
    声明号召全国人民在工人阶级领导下，立即对吉田政府展开斗争。声明说：工人阶级的斗争将表现在各地的罢工中。在六月里，罢工浪潮将开展到全国各地。工商界要求进行日中、日苏贸易以克服经济萧条的运动将比以前壮大起来。反对殖民地化、反对军国主义法西斯化的斗争将发展成为打击日本统治阶级以至美国占领者的统治力量基础的斗争。
    声明强调说：日本共产党将站在人民斗争的最前列，为人民竭尽忠诚，完成作为日本工人阶级先锋队的政党的任务。
    声明最后号召打倒第五届吉田卖国政府；建立新的统一的人民政府。
    【新华社四日讯】东京消息：拥有会员约三百万人的日本最大的工会组织——日本工会总评议会
    （简称“总评”），二日宣布“总评”执行委员会在一日通过的“总评”下一年度行动计划草案。草案宣布“总评”今后要在争取和平的斗争中粉碎反对和平的障碍。草案并强烈指责华尔街和日本等国垄断资本存心阻挠和平和企图继续军火生产。
    在这个草案中，“总评”重申了它要发动要求增加工资运动的决心。
