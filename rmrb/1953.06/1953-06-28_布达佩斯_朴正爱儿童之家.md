　　Budapest "Park Jung-ae Children's Home"
    On the right bank of the Danube, the Hungarian capital of Buda is surrounded by beautiful mountains. In the most beautiful Lengu area of ​​this mountainous Buda city, there live two hundred Korean orphans, including one hundred and fifty-three boys and forty-seven girls. At the invitation of the government of the Hungarian People's Republic, they arrived in Budapest on May 8 this year.
    In a large park, amidst groves of ancient pine and chestnut trees, three houses were built to accommodate these children. This is the "Park Jung-ae Children's Home." Two of them are the main houses, containing bedrooms, classrooms, dining rooms, and cultural centers, as well as some teachers' rooms. The other house is smaller and is a clinic specifically for sick children. Two nurses are here day and night to take care of the sick children, and doctors spend six hours a day serving the children. In this sunny and tidy room, it is decorated with carpets, tablecloths, and curtains, and flowers are placed everywhere.
    Every morning at six thirty, the children are already awake from their dreams, and they fold their beds neatly by themselves. All the girls put their beautiful dolls with Hungarian national characteristics on their bedside, which was a gift from the Hungarian Democratic Women's Federation when they arrived at the Budapest station. Then, they go to a bathroom fitted with glass mirrors to take a bath. After finishing their morning exercises, they line up and hold a flag-raising ceremony. Amidst the sound of the Korean national anthem, the magnificent national flags of Korea and Hungary are slowly raised.
    In the restaurant, the children eat a rich breakfast. They quickly got used to Hungarian food. They were not used to drinking coffee at first, but now they are used to it.
    Classes start at nine o'clock. Students are divided into four classes according to their level, and each group consists of fifteen to twenty people. Two Korean teachers teach them arithmetic and Korean. Hungarian teachers rely on the help of pictures to teach the Korean children five new Hungarian words every day, but they can learn more Hungarian words in their daily lives. The first Hungarian word they learned was "Forward," which the Hungarian Young Pioneers say when saluting. By September this year, they will have learned the equivalent of what is taught in nearby public schools in terms of reading and writing in Hungarian. They often spend their break time during the three hours of class on a sunny and spacious platform.
    At noon, a delicious lunch is being prepared in a modern kitchen. On the lunch menu it says: vegetable soup, braised beef, rice, lettuce, and dessert.
    After lunch, there is a two-hour break. In the afternoon, they will eat some snacks. Before dinner is their playtime, and each class has its own playground. The basketball court is often never empty. The boys like to play ball and play a war game the most. The girls like to sing and play games in a circle. Before eating dinner and lowering the flag, they are always singing or dancing Korean folk songs and dances.
    Korean children quickly became familiar with their new home and liked it very much. Through the love of the entire Hungarian people represented by their teachers, they feel warm caresses and affectionate care. The shadow of war has disappeared from their faces, and their eyes will always be filled with the light of joy.

　　布达佩斯“朴正爱儿童之家”
    在多瑙河右岸的匈牙利的首都布达城被美丽的山峰所环抱。在这多山的布达城的最美丽的泠谷地区，居住着二百名朝鲜的孤儿，其中有一百五十三个是男孩子，四十七个是女孩子。他们是应匈牙利人民共和国政府的邀请，于今年五月八日来到布达佩斯的。
    在一个大公园里，在古松和栗树的丛林中间，修建了三座招待这些儿童们的房屋。这就是“朴正爱儿童之家”。其中两座是主要的房屋，里面有寝室、教室、餐厅和文艺馆以及一些教师的房间。另外一座房屋比较小一些，那是专为有病的孩子们而设的一个医务所。日夜有两个护士在这里照顾着生病的孩子，医生们也每天花六个钟头的时间来为孩子们服务。在这阳光充足的整洁的屋子里，装饰着地毯、桌布和窗帷，还到处摆设着鲜花。
    每天早晨六点半钟，孩童们早已从睡梦中醒来，他们自己把床铺叠得整整齐齐的。所有的女孩子都把她们的带有匈牙利民族色彩的美丽的洋娃娃放在她们的床头上，那是当她们到达布达佩斯车站时，匈牙利民主妇联送给她们的礼物。然后，他们就到一间装置着玻璃镜子的浴室里去洗澡。做完早操后，他们排好队，举行升旗典礼。在朝鲜国歌声中，朝鲜和匈牙利两国壮丽的国旗徐徐升起。
    在餐厅里，孩子们吃着丰富的早餐。他们对匈牙利的饮食很快就习惯起来了。他们起初喝不惯咖啡，现在也习惯了。
    九点钟开始上课。学生根据程度的不同分成四班，又每十五个到二十个人组成一个小组。有两个朝鲜教师教他们算术和朝鲜语文。匈牙利的教师则依靠了图画的帮助每天教那些朝鲜孩子们认识五个匈牙利文的新字，但是他们在日常生活中却能学得更多的匈牙利文字。他们所学的第一个匈牙利字，就是匈牙利少年儿童队在行礼时所说的：“前进”。到今年九月，他们在匈牙利语文的读和写方面，将能学到了相当于附近公立学校里所教的程度。他们在三小时上课中间的休息时间，经常是在阳光充沛的宽广的平台上度过的。
    中午，在有着现代化设备的厨房里，正准备着美味的午餐。在午餐的菜单上写着：蔬菜汤，卤牛肉、米饭、生菜和点心。
    午餐后，有两小时的休息。下午，他们还要吃一些点心。晚饭前是他们游戏的时间，每一班都有他们自己的游戏场。在篮球场上是经常没有空的。男孩子们最喜欢打球和玩一种打仗的游戏。女孩子们则喜欢围着圆圈唱歌和游戏。每当吃晚饭和降旗以前，他们总是在唱着或跳着朝鲜的民间歌舞。
    朝鲜的儿童们很快地就熟习了他们新的家庭而且非常喜欢它。通过他们教师所代表的全匈牙利人民对他们的热爱，他们感受到温暖的爱抚和亲切的关怀。战争的阴影已从他们的脸上消失，他们的眼睛里将永远充满着欢乐的光芒。
