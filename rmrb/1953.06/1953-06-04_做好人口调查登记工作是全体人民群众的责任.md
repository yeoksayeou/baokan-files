    Doing a Good Job in Population Survey and Registration is the Responsibility of All the People

    Hao Zhanbiao from Naobao Village, Fourth District, Sa County, Suiyuan Province writes: The peasants in our village are very much in favor of the national population survey and voter registration being carried out in preparation for the general election, because this is a matter that concerns the vital interests of our people. We have discussed: how can we do this work of great historical significance well? Everyone believes that population survey and registration is a very heavy task. To do this work well, not only the cadres doing election work have a responsibility, but the people of the whole country have a responsibility. In the process of the survey, we must actively participate, register truthfully, and strengthen the supervisory role of the masses. If we find any phenomenon of repeated, omitted, or incorrect surveys, we must declare it to the survey registration station to ensure that the survey work is accurate. We must also be vigilant and prevent sabotage by bad elements, so that the population survey and registration work can proceed smoothly.

    做好人口调查登记工作是全体人民群众的责任
    绥远省萨县四区脑包村郝占标来信：我村农民都非常拥护为准备普选而进行的全国人口调查和选民登记工作，因为这是关系着我们全国人民切身利益的事情。我们曾经讨论过：怎样才能做好这件有伟大历史意义的工作。大家都认为：人口调查登记是件很繁重的任务，要做好这项工作，不仅是做选举工作的干部有责任，全国人民都有责任。在调查过程中，我们一定要积极参加，据实登记，并加强群众的监督作用。如果我们发觉了有调查重复、遗漏或者不正确的现象，一定到调查登记站去声明，保证使调查工作做到准确。我们还要提高警惕，防止坏分子的破坏活动，使人口调查登记工作顺利进行。
