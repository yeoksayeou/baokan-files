    Engineering Scheduling System to Guarantee the Realization of Work Plans
    By our reporter Chen Ji
    Drafting a construction work plan is only the beginning of the work; to truly realize the work plan, it is also necessary to establish an engineering scheduling system to regularly supervise and inspect the execution of the work plan, and to eliminate new imbalances that occur during the execution process. Comrade Stalin taught us at the Sixteenth Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks): "Only bureaucrats can think about planning matters in this way, believing that the work is finished once the plan is made. They do not know that formulating a plan is only the beginning of the planning undertaking. True leadership of the plan only expands after the plan is formulated, after the plan is actually reviewed in various localities, and after the plan is implemented and corrected." Because the situation faced by construction departments is very complex and ever-changing, the drafted work plan cannot completely conform to the actual situation, without any changes at all. In the practice of construction, things that do not conform to the plan will be discovered at any time, and even completely unexpected new situations will be discovered. This requires all construction units to establish an engineering scheduling system, implement regular supervision and inspection, constantly understand the progress of construction, timely and correctly guarantee the supply of labor, materials, machinery, equipment, tools, water, electricity, and semi-finished products, and resolutely prevent and eliminate shortcomings, stoppages, and accidents in the construction process to ensure the realization of the work plan.
    With the establishment of an engineering scheduling system, it is possible to prevent factors that undermine the plan in advance and to fight for the completion and over fulfillment of the work plan. The Beijing Iron and Steel Industry Institute construction area established a scheduling office during the responsibility system movement, and set up dispatchers in various construction sites, engineering teams, and relevant business sections, forming a scheduling network for the entire construction area. The scheduling office collects information on the on-site construction situation through this scheduling network, and then studies these situations based on the work plan, thereby discovering shortcomings in the construction. According to the work plan, the scheduling office of the Beijing Iron and Steel Industry Institute construction area learned about the material storage situation of the material section and found that the required wire nails and screws had not yet been fully purchased. The scheduling office then urged the material section to purchase wire nails and screws as soon as possible to ensure that there would be no work stoppages due to lack of materials in the future. The scheduling office also learned about the progress of the second construction site's project based on the work plan and found that the progress of the fourth building was slow, which would affect the overall project progress; it promptly reminded the second construction site to change the project's procedure to prevent delays in the construction period. The second construction site needed to burn creosote in the foundation project, but did not prepare the creosote; the scheduling office discovered this shortcoming five days in advance and also warned the second construction site to quickly prepare the creosote. Therefore, Xu Deyi, the director of the second construction site, said: "The implementation of the scheduling system has been of great help to us. We are busy with affairs every day, and it is easy to make mistakes. The scheduling office reminds us, so that we can make fewer mistakes and not fail to complete the plan." However, the predictive ability of the scheduling office of the Beijing Iron and Steel Industry Institute construction area is not yet sufficient, and it has not received great results.
    With the establishment of an engineering scheduling system, it is also possible to eliminate shortcomings that have already undermined the work plan, enabling the construction unit to catch up with the construction period and complete the plan on schedule. On June 4th, the scheduling office of the Beijing Iron and Steel Industry Institute construction area heard from the dispatcher of the second construction site that two bricklayer teams at the second construction site could not build brick walls well due to their low technical skills, and had to rework three times, failing to complete the bricklaying project according to plan. The dispatcher immediately transferred thirteen highly skilled bricklayers from the first construction site to support the second construction site, ensuring the progress of the bricklaying project. The director of the second construction site was very happy and praised the benefits of the scheduling system: "In the past, without a scheduling system, we had to stop work due to a shortage of bricklayers; but other units had surplus bricklayers, and they were also allowed to idle, without helping us. Now that we have a scheduling system, there are dedicated people to allocate labor, and the kind of unreasonable phenomenon that occurred in the past will never happen again." The second construction site was once unable to pour cement due to a lack of formwork panels. The scheduling office learned about this situation and immediately investigated the construction area's material reserves, finding that the first construction site had seventy cubic meters of formwork panels that were temporarily not in use, so it transferred this batch of formwork panels to the second construction site, ensuring that the second construction site would not stop work due to a lack of materials. Without a scheduling system, this matter would also be impossible to handle. The head of the material section said it well: "In the past, whoever received the materials would not let go. If one construction site ran out of materials, we would rush to buy them, not knowing that another construction site was still hoarding these materials without using them! Even if we knew, we couldn't transfer them out! Because no one would be willing to take them out! Now that there is a scheduling system, once a scheduling order is issued, those with materials have nothing to say and have to take out the materials, otherwise they will violate the scheduling order and be subject to punishment." They believe that with the implementation of the scheduling system, their work is much easier.
    The establishment of an engineering scheduling system can not only prevent and eliminate defects in construction, but also achieve unified and centralized leadership, avoiding decentralized and multi-headed leadership. In the past, there were several directors in a construction area or construction site. These directors often issued instructions and orders separately, and these instructions and orders often contradicted each other, leaving the cadres below at a loss. The cadres on the site said: "We listened to what this director said and did as instructed; that director ran over and said it wouldn't work! He wanted us to change. We don't know who to listen to." However, with the engineering scheduling system, this kind of chaotic phenomenon can be avoided. The engineering scheduling system stipulates that all relevant work orders and instructions must be uniformly transmitted through the scheduling office, and no individual is allowed to issue orders and instructions arbitrarily. Under the unified command of the scheduling office, not only does it not hinder the authority of the construction leaders, but it also helps the construction leaders to get rid of routine work and better guide the construction work. This is because the scheduling office works under the direct leadership of the construction area director or chief engineer. Issuing the instructions and orders of the construction area director to various units through the scheduling system does not harm the authority of the construction leaders in any way. Because of the scheduling system, the construction leaders can jump out of the routine work of approving notes and issuing instructions. In the past, a construction leader had to deal with the heads of all units every day, solve the trivial problems raised below, listen to the reports of various units, and hold ad hoc meetings every day to understand the situation and discover problems. In this way, this construction worker could not carefully consider problems and solve problems proactively, and could only fall into the passive state of treating the head when it hurts and treating the foot when it hurts. However, with the establishment of a scheduling system, leaders can understand the situation below in a timely manner and proactively solve the problems below through the scheduling system. Some problems that do not need to be solved by the construction leaders can be solved by the scheduling office. In this way, because the leaders have reduced routine work, they can focus their main energy on the main problems in the construction.
    Under the unified command of the scheduling office, it is also possible to command the work of various units from the overall situation, eliminate the phenomenon of mutual disconnection and mutual evasion, overcome departmentalism, and guarantee the realization of the work plan rhythmically and comprehensively. In the absence of a scheduling system, one unit may grab more materials and fight for more labor in order to complete its own tasks, while other units have to stop work due to a lack of these materials and labor. With a scheduling system, this type of situation is not allowed to occur, and labor and materials will be allocated appropriately and reasonably. In the past, one unit could work in a procrastinating manner, regardless of the progress of the entire project; when using a crane, it would use it for an extra day, but not ask whether other units would have to stop work for a day waiting for the crane. After the implementation of the scheduling system, this phenomenon is not allowed to occur, and this unit will be supervised to use the crane on schedule, and no delays are allowed. The scheduling office of the Beijing Iron and Steel Industry Institute construction area once discovered that the processing plant could not complete the prefabrication of concrete beams on time, so the scheduling office asked the processing plant to speed up and catch up with the construction period, so as not to hinder the needs of the site. After the second construction site completed the earthwork project, the plumbing team dug up the earthwork again to install plumbing pipes. The scheduling office discovered this problem and, at the scheduling meeting, asked the plumbing team to install the pipes before doing the earthwork project to avoid damaging the completed earthwork. In the absence of a scheduling system, these problems often cannot be solved, and the various units and trades are not connected to each other, restraining each other, hindering
    the progress of the project, and affecting the completion of the work plan.
    As mentioned above, the implementation of the scheduling system can not only prevent and eliminate factors that undermine the plan, but also achieve unified and centralized leadership, overcome the phenomenon of each doing its own thing, and powerfully guarantee the realization of the work plan.

    保证作业计划实现的工程调度制
    本报记者  陈迹
    编制了施工作业计划，还只是工作的开始；真正要实现作业计划，还必须建立工程调度制，经常地监督和检查作业计划的执行，消除执行过程中发生的新的不平衡的因素。斯大林同志在联共（布）第十六次代表大会上教导我们说：“只有官僚主义者才能这样来想计划上的事情，以为只要计划一经制定，工作便完结了。不知制定计划仅只是计划事业的开始。真正对计划的领导，仅是在计划制定后，在各地方上把计划实际审查后，在计划实行和更正后才扩展的。”由于施工部门面对的情况是十分复杂、变化多端的，编制好了的作业计划，不可能完全符合于实际情况，一丝一毫也不变动。在施工的实践过程中，随时会发现和计划不相符合的事情，甚至会发现完全没有料想到的新情况。这就要求各施工单位必须把工程调度制建立起来，实行经常的监督和检查，不断地了解施工进度的情况，及时地、正确地保证劳动力、材料、机械设备、工具、水、电力和半成品的供应，坚决地防止和消除施工过程中的缺点、停工和事故，以保证作业计划的实现。
    建立了工程调度制，就可以预先防止破坏计划的因素，为完成和超额完成作业计划而斗争。北京钢铁工业学院工区在建立责任制运动中，成立了调度室，在各工地、各工程队和有关的业务股设置了调度员，组成了全工区的调度网。调度室通过这个调度网，搜集现场施工的情况，再根据作业计划来研究这些情况，从而发现施工中的缺点。北京钢铁工业学院工区调度室根据作业计划，曾经了解了材料股储存材料的情况，发现计划上所需要的洋钉、螺丝还没有购齐，调度室遂督促材料股及早购买洋钉和螺丝，保证将来不停工待料。调度室也曾经根据作业计划了解第二工地的工程进度，发见第四栋楼房的进度慢，会影响整个工程进度；便及时地提醒第二工地，要他们改变工程的程序，防止拖延工期的情况发生。第二工地需要在基础工程上烫臭油，但没有准备臭油；调度室在五天前发现这个缺点，也及早地警告第二工地，赶快准备臭油。所以第二工地主任许德义说：“实行了调度制，对我们的帮助很大。我们天天忙于事务，很容易发生差错，调度室提醒我们，使我们可以少犯错误，不至于完不成计划。”但是，北京钢铁工业学院工区调度室的预见性还不够，还没有收到很大的效果。
    建立了工程调度制，还可以消除已经破坏了作业计划的缺点，使得施工单位能够赶上工期，按期完成计划。北京钢铁工业学院工区调度室在六月四日听到第二工地调度员的汇报，知道第二工地两个瓦工小组因为技术低，砌不好砖墙，返工了三次，不能按时完成砌砖工程的计划。调度员马上从第一工地调了十三名技术高的瓦工来支援第二工地，保证砌砖工程的进度。第二工地主任很高兴，赞扬调度制度的好处：“过去没有调度制，我们缺瓦工，只好停工；但别的单位多余瓦工，也让他们窝工，不接济我们。现在有了调度制，有专人来调配劳动力，再也不会发生过去那种不合理的现象了。”第二工地曾经因为缺乏模型板而不能打洋灰。调度室知道这个情况，马上调查了工区的材料储备情况，发现第一工地有七十立方公尺的模型板暂时不用，于是就把这批模型板调给第二工地，保证了第二工地不停工待料。如果没有调度制，这件事也是办不到的。材料股股长说得好：“过去谁领到了材料，谁也不肯放手。一个工地没有了材料，我们急急忙忙去购买，那里还知道另一个工地还积压着这些材料不用呢！即使知道了，也调不出来呀！因为谁都不肯拿出来呵！现在有了调度制，一个调度命令下来，有材料的人没话讲，只好拿出材料，否则违反
    调度命令，会要受处分。”他们认为：实行调度制，他们的工作好办多了。
    工程调度制的建立，不但能防止和消除施工中的缺陷，而且能实现统一的集中的领导，避免分散的多头的领导。过去一个工区或一个工地都有几个主任。这些主任往往分别下达指示，发布命令，这些指示和命令又常常互相矛盾，使得下面的干部无所适从。现场上的干部们说：“我们听了这个主任的话，照样做了；那个主任跑来，连说不行！要我们改变。我们不知道究竟听谁的好。”但是，有了工程调度制度，就可以避免这种混乱现象。在工程调度制中，规定了一切有关的作业的命令和指示，都必须通过调度室统一传达下去，不容许任何个人乱发命令和指示。在调度室的统一指挥下，不仅不妨碍施工领导人员的职权，而且会帮助施工领导人员摆脱事务工作，能够更好地指导施工工作。因为调度室是在工区主任或主任工程师直接领导下进行工作的。把工区主任的指示和命令通过调度系统下达各单位，丝毫也不损害施工领导人员的职权。施工领导人员因为有了调度制度，反而可以跳出了批条子、发指示的事务圈子。过去一个施工领导人员天天要和所有单位的负责人打交道，要解决下面提出的大大小小的琐碎的问题，要听取各个单位的汇报，要每天召开碰头会议，临时了解情况来发现问题。这样，这个施工人员就不能周密地考虑问题，有预见地解决问题，只好陷入头痛医头、脚痛医脚的被动状态中。但是建立了调度制，领导人员就能够通过调度系统，及时地了解下情，主动地解决下面的问题。有些不需要施工领导人员解决的问题，就可以由调度室来解决了。这样，领导人员因为减轻了事务工作，就能把主要精力放在施工中的主要问题上。
    在调度室的统一指挥下，还可以从全局出发，统一地指挥各单位的工作，消除互不联系互相推诿的现象，克服本位主义思想，有节奏地全面地保证作业计划的实现。在没有调度制的情况下，一个单位为了完成自己的任务，可以多抢一些材料，多争得一些劳动力，而别的单位则因为缺少这些材料和劳动力而不得不停工。有了调度制，就不容许这类情况的发生，就会适当地合理地调配劳动力和材料。过去，一个单位可以拖拖踏踏地工作，不管整个工程的进度；在使用起重机时，多使用了一天，却不问别的单位会因为等待这台起重机而停工一天。在实行了调度制后，就不许可这种现象的发生，就会监督这个单位按期用完起重机，不得拖延。北京钢铁工业学院工区调度室曾经发现加工厂不能按时完成混凝土梁的预制工作，于是调度室要求加工厂加紧赶上工期，不能妨碍现场的需要。第二工地做好了土方工程，水暖队却又把土方挖坏，安装水暖管道。调度室发现这个问题，在调度会议上，要求水暖队在做土方工程之前安装管道，以免破坏做好的土方。在没有调度制的时候，常常不能解决这些问题，各单位、各工种间互不联系，互相牵制，妨碍
    工程进度，影响了作业计划的完成。
    如上所述，实行了调度制，不但能防止和消除破坏计划的因素，而且能实现统一的集中的领导，克服各自为政的现象，有力地保证作业计划的实现。
