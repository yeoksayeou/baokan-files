    Administrative Responsibility System is the Foundation of Various Responsibility Systems in Construction
    By our reporter Chen Ji
    In order to overcome the phenomenon of no one being responsible in construction units, it is necessary to establish various responsibility systems, and the most important is to establish an administrative responsibility system. The administrative responsibility system is the foundation of all other responsibility systems. Without an administrative responsibility system, there is no guarantee for the implementation of the construction responsibility system—work plan, project scheduling system, and construction organization design; the realization of technical responsibility system, supply responsibility system, and economic accounting responsibility system is also not guaranteed. The basic requirements for establishing an administrative responsibility system are to implement a unified and centralized leadership in administrative management; to determine the tasks and responsibilities of each unit; to stipulate the responsibility of each person; to establish and improve organizational structures; to clarify the relationship between various units; and to truly realize the system of dedicated personnel for dedicated positions.
    In the general task of completing the national plan, what specific tasks should each unit undertake, and what work should be carried out, must be stipulated in the administrative responsibility system. Without these stipulations, the task is not clear, and the responsibility is not clear.
    Before the establishment of the administrative responsibility system, the Beijing Iron and Steel Industry Institute construction site had some units with unclear tasks. Some units did not do the work they should have done; instead, they did the work they should not have done. The labor organization section of the construction site once replaced the work of the general affairs section, borrowing meal tickets for workers, finding houses, and negotiating transportation, while abandoning the necessary labor organization work of its own unit. Due to the failure to carry out labor organization work, the phenomenon of unreasonable labor organization in the construction site has not been eliminated to this day.
    However, it is not enough to simply stipulate the tasks of each unit. In order to complete various tasks, it is also necessary to stipulate the responsibilities of each unit to avoid mutual shirking of responsibility. Before the establishment of the administrative responsibility system, the Beijing Iron and Steel Industry Institute construction site often experienced the phenomenon of mutual shirking of responsibility due to unclear responsibilities of each unit. Although the materials supply department supplied the materials, it did not care about the quality of the materials and the time of supply. For example, the materials supply department once stored a batch of red bricks this year, some of which were not of the correct specifications and were of poor quality. This problem should have been solved by the materials supply department. However, the cadres of the materials supply department shirked responsibility, saying that they did not understand technology and that the quality of the materials should be resolved by the technical inspection department. Similarly, the materials supply department recently failed to supply wood in a timely manner, affecting construction; but the cadres of the materials supply department said: "We have urged the higher authorities many times, but the higher authorities did not allocate it, how can we be responsible?" If there is an administrative responsibility system, clearly stipulating that the materials supply department should not only ensure the quantity of materials supplied, but also check the quality of the materials, ensure that the materials meet the specifications, and ensure the timeliness of the supply, then this phenomenon of shirking responsibility can be prevented.
    No matter how beautiful and specific the tasks and responsibilities are stipulated, if there is no dedicated person to execute them, it is still a formality. Therefore, in the administrative responsibility system, it is also necessary to stipulate the responsibilities that each person should bear in completing the tasks and responsibilities. This personal responsibility system is the most important part of the administrative responsibility system. Without a personal responsibility system, the realization of the administrative responsibility system is impossible. In the past, the Beijing Iron and Steel Industry Institute construction site did not have a personal responsibility system, forming a phenomenon of "everyone is responsible, but no one is responsible." The labor organization section once had such an incident: The general affairs section requested the section to allocate ten water carriers. The head of the section, upon hearing this request, found ten water carriers from outside; the first deputy head of the section, upon hearing this request, found another ten water carriers; the second deputy head of the section, upon hearing this request, found another ten water carriers. Later, everyone found out that it was duplicated, and they all sent the water carriers back. More than ten days later, when the general affairs section urged them, they recruited another ten water carriers from outside. Such things are not isolated cases in the absence of a personal responsibility system. Due to unclear personal responsibilities, the phenomenon of no one doing things often occurs. Tong Chenguang, head of the supply section, once told me: "In the past, we had a lot of work, but no one was willing to do it, using the excuse that 'This is not my responsibility.' As the head of the section, I had no choice. Because there was no personal responsibility system, I had to allocate all the work myself. No one cared about the work that could not be allocated." But after the establishment of the administrative responsibility system, stipulating the responsibilities of each person, everyone took the initiative to do their job well. Jiang Bo, a tool clerk in the tool equipment section, knew that his responsibility was to keep the tools. He often ran to the warehouse in his spare time to take a look, fearing that the tools would be damaged. He used gasoline to wipe off the rust on the tools, and he was still not at ease. He said: "I feel bad when a tool is broken." Chen Yukun, head of the tool equipment section, said: "In the past, without a personal responsibility system, who cared about these tools? When the tools were broken, no one was responsible, and no one felt bad!"
    While stipulating the responsibilities of each unit and each individual, it is also necessary to improve the organizational structure of administrative management. This is also another important part of the administrative responsibility system. Without a sound organizational structure, without an effective organizational structure that faces the construction, the establishment of an administrative responsibility system is just empty talk.
    Before the establishment of the administrative responsibility system, the organizational structure of the Beijing Iron and Steel Industry Institute construction site was not suitable for the needs of the site. The organization of the construction site was large and had many personnel; but the organization of the construction site, which directly carried out the construction, was very empty. Inside the construction site, there were only the director and a few construction workers and recorders, who were busy and unable to effectively lead the construction. Almost all the technical personnel and management personnel were placed inside the construction site, doing indoor work and unable to directly guide the construction. The characteristic of this kind of organization is that there are many procedures, many signatures and stamps, and many official documents and forms, which hinder the on-site work. At the construction site, to receive a tool, one had to run to several places, stamp six seals, spend four or five hours, and may still not be able to receive it. In the process of establishing the administrative responsibility system, the construction site simplified the organization of the construction site and enriched the construction site. Many technical personnel went to the construction site to specifically solve the problems on the site. In addition, some necessary organizations were established at the construction site. There are also special organizations responsible for the work that no one was responsible for. For example, the construction site has a supply team, responsible for the supply, storage and other work of on-site materials. This avoids the phenomenon of no one being responsible due to the lack of a special organization.
    The decentralized and multi-headed leadership method does not meet the objective requirements of the project. Because the project itself has a centralized nature. The organizational method of the Beijing Iron and Steel Industry Institute construction site did not implement the principle of centralized and unified leadership in the past. The functional organizations of the construction site could directly assign business work to the construction site without going through the construction site director. This not only hindered the enthusiasm of the construction site director, but also created a phenomenon of no one being responsible for the work. The cadres sent by the functional organizations of the construction site worked at the construction site, but were not led by the construction site director, but by the functional organizations. These sent cadres were not responsible to the construction site director, and the construction site director could not manage them either. The construction site directors said: "We have the position but no power, how can we be responsible?" In establishing the responsibility system, the construction site implemented the unified leadership of the construction site director. Functional organizations were also established within the construction site, all under the leadership of the construction site director. The superior functional organizations only have business guidance relationship with the functional organizations of the construction site. The sense of responsibility of the construction site director has therefore been strengthened. In the past, the functional organizations of the construction site and the internal departments of each construction site did not implement a division of labor and unified leadership. Several responsible persons were parallel and could issue orders separately, making the lower level at a loss. To establish an administrative responsibility system, it is necessary to stipulate that the head of a section is the chief responsible person for the section, and other deputy heads assist the head in their work. These section heads can divide the work, but they must be unified under the leadership of the head. This can avoid the chaotic phenomenon of "everyone is responsible, but no one is responsible" in the past.
    To complete a job, it often requires the cooperation of many units. For example, materials supply is by no means a job that the materials supply department can do alone, but requires the cooperation of many units. If the construction technology department does not submit the materials budget in a timely and accurate manner, the materials supply department cannot carry out materials storage work. In establishing the administrative responsibility system, if such interrelationships are not stipulated, irresponsible phenomena of mutual buck-passing and mutual shirking will occur. Since these interrelationships are very complex and involve a wide range, the establishment of the administrative responsibility system must be discussed and negotiated carefully and repeatedly. When drafting the administrative responsibility system, the Beijing Iron and Steel Industry Institute construction site spent a long time on the relationship between various units and held many meetings. They held several "buck-passing meetings" to specifically expose the irresponsible phenomena caused by mutual buck-passing and mutual non-cooperation. In the process of each unit discussing the administrative responsibility system, they also adopted the method of "mutual visits" to solicit the opinions of the other party to supplement the content of the mutual responsibility system. After a unit drafted the administrative responsibility system, it convened a meeting of the heads of the relevant units to jointly review the administrative responsibility system of the unit to prevent the generation of departmentalism. This method is relatively successful. In the administrative responsibility system, in addition to stipulating the relationship between various units, it is also necessary to stipulate the relationship between the various departments of a unit. For example, in the administrative responsibility system of the materials supply department, it is necessary to stipulate the relationship between the planning and allocation, procurement and transportation, accounting, and storage groups. With such stipulations, the irresponsible phenomena of mutual buck-passing and mutual shirking between the various groups within the unit can also be overcome.
    Establishing an administrative responsibility system is an extremely meticulous and complex task. Before establishing this system, it is necessary to fully prepare, carefully study the content of this responsibility system, and establish this system with emphasis and purpose according to the actual situation. When the Beijing Iron and Steel Industry Institute construction site established the administrative responsibility system, the entire construction site had a central team, led by the director of the construction site. Each unit also had a central team, led by the person in charge of each unit. These central teams should draft the basic content of the system and carry out ideological leadership. With these central teams, this system can be established with leadership and preparation, preventing possible deviations. In the process of establishing the administrative responsibility system, the Beijing Iron and Steel Industry Institute construction site experienced some deviations. Some units, when establishing this system, stipulated the content in a very detailed and complex manner. Some people thought: "It's all established at once, so as to avoid trouble in the future." This is incorrect. The content of the administrative responsibility system should be clear, simple, and easy to implement. If the content is too complex and cannot be implemented, it is still useless. Establishing an administrative responsibility system is only the beginning of the work, and the system must be implemented. In the long-term implementation process, this system should be revised at any time according to the results of practice so that it can take effect. Some units, when establishing this system, were very hasty, the content was not specific, and the masses were not fully mobilized to discuss it. The tool equipment section once copied the responsibility system of the tool equipment section and used it as the responsibility system of the section without any changes. This is also incorrect. The establishment of the administrative responsibility system should be based on the shortcomings exposed in the construction in the past and the specific situation of the unit to determine the content of the system. At the same time, the content of the system should be fully grasped by the masses. An administrative responsibility system without a mass base is formal and cannot be implemented. In the process of establishing the administrative responsibility system, the Beijing Iron and Steel Industry Institute construction site corrected these deviations in a timely manner, so it did a relatively smooth job in establishing the administrative responsibility system.

    行政责任制是施工的各种责任制的基础
    本报记者　陈迹
    为了克服施工单位无人负责的现象，就要建立各种责任制度，而最重要的就是要把行政责任制建立起来。行政责任制是其他各种责任制的基础。没有行政责任制，施工责任制——作业计划、工程调度制、施工组织设计的贯彻就没有保证；技术责任制、供应责任制和经济核算责任制的实现也同样没有保证。建立行政责任制的基本要求，就是在行政管理上实行分工而又统一的一元化的领导；确定各单位的任务和职责；规定每个人的责任；建立和健全组织机构；明确各单位相互之间的关系；真正地实现专人专职的制度。
    在完成国家计划的总的任务中，各个单位应该负有那些具体的任务，应该进行那些工作，在行政责任制中都必须加以规定。不规定这一些，任务就不明确，责任就不清楚。
    北京钢铁工业学院工区在建立行政责任制以前，有些单位的任务是不明确的。有的单位，自己应该做的工作，没有做；不应该做的工作，却反而做了。该工区劳动组织股曾经代替了总务股的工作，替工人借饭票，找房子，交涉运输工具，而放弃了本单位必需要做的劳动组织工作。由于没有进行劳动组织工作，该工区劳动组织不合理的现象至今没有消除。
    但是仅仅规定了各单位的任务，还是很不够的。为了完成各项任务，还需要规定各单位的职责，以免互相推脱责任。在建立行政责任制以前，北京钢铁工业学院工区，常常因为各单位职责不清而发生互相推脱责任的现象。材料供应部门虽然供应了材料，但是对于材料的质量和供应的时间，都不过问。比如材料供应部门在今年曾经储备了一批红砖，有些红砖的规格不对，质量不好。这种问题本应由材料供应部门负责解决。但是材料供应部门的干部推说自己不懂技术，认为材料质量的问题应由技术检查部门来解决。同样的，材料供应部门最近没有能及时供应木料，影响施工；但材料供应部门的干部说：“我们向上级催了好多次，上级不调拨，我们怎么负责呀？”如果有了行政责任制，明确地规定材料供应部门不但要保证供应材料的数量，还要检查材料的质量，保证材料合乎规格和保证供应的及时，那么就可以防止这种推脱责任的现象发生。
    尽管任务和职责规定得怎么漂亮，怎么具体，但是如果不规定专人来执行，依然是形式主义的东西。因此在行政责任制中，还应该规定在完成任务和职责中每个人所应该负的责任。这种个人责任制，是行政责任制最重要的一部分。没有个人责任制，行政责任制的实现是不可能的。北京钢铁工业学院工区过去没有个人责任制，形成“人人负责，人人又不负责”的现象。劳动组织股曾经发生过这样一件事：总务股要求该股调给十名挑水工。该股正股长听到这个要求，向外面找了十名挑水工；第一副股长听到这个要求，又找了十名挑水工；第二副股长听到这个要求，又找了十名挑水工。后来，大家发现重复了，又都把找来的挑水工遣回。过了十多天，总务股催问时，才又从外面调了十名挑水工。像这样的事情，在没有个人责任制的情况下，还不是个别的。由于个人责任不清，还常常发生有事无人干的现象。供应股佟晨光股长曾经告诉我：“过去我们有很多工作，叫谁干，谁都不肯干，藉口说：‘这不是我的责任。’我当股长的，也没办法。因为没有个人责任制，什么工作都要由我来分配。分配不出去的工作，就没有人过问。”但是建立了行政责任制，规定了各人的责任，大家都主动地做好自己的工作。工具设备股工具员姜波知道自己的责任是保管工具。他常常在业余时间内，跑到仓库去看看，生怕工具受损失。他用汽油擦掉工具上的铁锈，还不放心。他说：“坏了一件工具，我心里就难受。”工具设备股股长陈玉崑说：“过去没有个人责任制，谁关心这些工具呢？工具坏了，谁也不负责，谁也不难受呵！”
    在规定各单位和各个人的职责的同时，还必须健全行政管理的组织机构。这也是行政责任制的另一方面的重要内容。没有一个健全的组织机构，没有一个面向施工的有效能的组织机构，建立行政责任制就是一句空话。
    北京钢铁工业学院工区建立行政责任制以前的组织机构是不适合现场需要的。工区的机构庞大，人员众多；而直接施工的工地的机构，却非常空虚，在工地内，只有主任和几个施工员、记录员，忙忙碌碌，不能有力地领导施工。所有的技术人员和管理人员，几乎都放在工区内，做着室内工作，不能直接地指导施工。这种机构的特点，就是手续多、签名盖章多、公文表格多，妨碍现场工作。工地里，要领一个工具，就得跑几个地方，盖上六个章，花了四五个钟头，还可能领不着。该工区在建立行政责任制的过程中，简化了工区的机构，充实了工地，许多技术人员下了工地，具体地解决现场上的问题。此外，还在工地成立了一些必要的机构。没有专人负责的工作，也有专门的机构来负责了。比如工地有了供应组，负责现场材料的供应、保管等工作。这样就避免了因为没有专门机构而产生的无人负责的现象。
    分散的多头的领导方式，是不合乎工程的客观要求的。因为工程本身，是具有集中性的。北京钢铁工业学院工区的组织方式，在过去是没有贯彻集中统一的领导原则的。工区的各职能机构可以不通过工地主任，垂直地向工地布置业务工作。这样不但妨碍了工地主任的积极性，也造成了工作中无人负责的现象。工区的各职能机构派出干部，在工地工作，不受工地主任领导，而受各职能机构的领导。这些派出的干部不对工地主任负责，工地主任也管不了他们。工地主任们说：“我们有职无权，怎么负责呢？”该工区在建立责任制中，实行了工地主任的统一的领导。在工地内也设立职能机构，全归工地主任领导。上级职能机构对工地的职能机构，只有业务上的指导关系。工地主任的责任心因而加强了。该工区各职能机构和各工地内部，在过去也没有实行分工而又统一的领导。几个负责人，都是平行的，都可以分头地发号施令，弄得下面无所适从。建立行政责任制，就必须规定一个股的正股长为股内的总负责人，其他副股长辅助正股长工作。这几个股长可以分工，但又要由正股长来统一领导。这就可以避免过去那种“人人负责，人人又不负责”的混乱现象。
    要完成一件工作，常常需要许多单位互相配合。比如材料供应工作，决不是材料供应部门所能单独进行的，而是要靠许多单位来配合进行的。如果施工技术部门不及时而准确地提出材料预算，材料供应部门就不能进行材料储备工作。在建立行政责任制中，不规定这种相互之间的责任制，就会发生互相扯皮、互相推诿的不负责的现象。由于这类相互之间的关系问题是非常复杂的、牵连很广的，在建立行政责任制时，必须细致地反复地讨论、协商。北京钢铁工业学院工区在拟定行政责任制的草案时，对于各单位相互间的关系问题，曾花费了较长的时间，召开了许多次会议。他们曾经召开了几次“扯皮会议”，专门揭发由于互相扯皮、互相不配合而产生的无人负责的现象。在各单位讨论行政责任制的过程中，又采用“互相访问”的方式，征求对方的意见，来补充相互间责任制的内容。当一个单位拟好行政责任制草稿以后，又召开各有关单位的负责人的会议，共同会审这个单位的行政责任制，防止本位主义思想产生。这个方法，是比较成功的。在行政责任制中，除了规定各单位之间的关系而外，在一个单位内，也要规定本单位的各个部门之间的关系。比如在材料供应部门的行政责任制内，就要规定计配、购运、会计、保管等组之间的关系。有了这样的规定，也可以克服本单位内部各组之间互相扯皮、互相推诿的不负责任的现象。
    建立行政责任制，是一项极其细致而又复杂的工作。在建立这个制度之前，要充分地做好准备工作，要仔细研究这个责任制度的内容，要根据实际情况有重点地有目的地来建立这个制度。北京钢铁工业学院工区在建立行政责任制时，全工区有个中心小组，由工区主任来领导。在各单位也有中心小组，由各单位的负责人来领导。这些中心小组，要草拟制度的基本内容，还要进行思想领导。有了这些中心小组，就可以有领导地有准备地来建立这个制度，防止可能发生的偏向。北京钢铁工业学院工区在建立行政责任制的过程中，曾经发生过一些偏向。有些单位在建立这个制度时，把内容规定得很细致，很复杂。有些人以为：“一次都建立好了，免得将来再麻烦。”这是不正确的。行政责任制的内容，应该明确、简单，易于执行。内容太复杂了，不能执行，还是没有用的。建立了行政责任制，还仅仅是工作的开始，还必须贯彻这个制度。在长时期的贯彻过程中，要根据实践的结果，来随时修正这个制度，使它能够发生效力。有些单位在建立这个制度时，非常草率，内容不具体，又没充分发动群众来讨论。工具设备股曾经把工具设备科的责任制抄袭下来，原封不动地当成该股的责任制。这也是不对的。建立行政责任制，应该根据过去所暴露的施工中的缺点和本单位的具体情况，来确定制度的内容。同时要让制度的内容，完全为群众所掌握。没有群众基础的行政责任制，是形式的，是不能贯彻的。北京钢铁工业学院工区在建立行政责任制的过程中，都及时地纠正了这些偏向，因而比较顺利地做好了建立行政责任制的工作。
