Xinhua News Agency, Prague, June 12th: The London "Daily Worker" published an editorial on June 9th, calling on the entire labor movement to "take action to force the government to immediately abolish all restrictions on East-West trade." The editorial severely condemned the new regulations implemented by the U.S. government on June 8th, which struck at other countries' trade with China and prohibited any foreign aircraft and ships carrying goods to China from purchasing fuel and supplies in the United States or any of its territories.

The editorial pointed out that now is the time to completely smash the U.S. policy of restricting British trade with the Soviet Union, China, and the People's Democracies. The editorial said: "While taking steps towards peace, world trade restrictions must be eliminated. In this way, peace will not mean stock market crashes and economic depression, but a great expansion of world trade, giving British workers in basic industries work to do." The editorial added that expanding East-West trade was almost a requirement of every British trade union conference held this year.

The "Daily Worker" editorial said that even the London "Times" had to protest, but the London "Times" described the new U.S. order as "a symbol of a deep divergence in practices" between Britain and the United States, while the "Daily Worker" believes that "the new U.S. order actually symbolizes the determination of American big business to economically strangle Britain." The editorial said that "in today's circumstances," it would be "intolerable and completely suicidal" to silently accept the U.S. ban on British trade.

    伦敦“工人日报”社论号召工人阶级行动起来
    反对美国限制英国与中苏等国贸易的政策
    【新华社布拉格十二日电】伦敦“工人日报”六月九日发表社论，号召整个劳工运动“行动起来，迫使政府立即取消对东西方贸易的种种限制”。社论严厉斥责美国政府在六月八日实行的新条例，这些条例打击了其他国家与中国的贸易，并禁止装载货物前往中国的任何外国飞机和船只在美国或美国的任何属地购买燃料和用品。
    社论指出，现在是彻底粉碎美国限制英国与苏联、中国和人民民主国家进行贸易的政策的时候了。社论说：“在采取走向和平的步骤的同时，必须消除世界贸易限制。这样，和平才不会意味着股票暴跌和经济萧条，而是意味着世界贸易的大大扩展，使英国从事基本工业的工人有工可做。”社论又说，扩展东西方贸易差不多是今年举行的每一个英国工会会议的要求。
    “工人日报”社论说，甚至伦敦“泰晤士报”也不得不表示抗议，但是伦敦“泰晤士报”却把美国的新命令说成是英美两国“在做法上的深刻分歧的象征”，而“工人日报”则认为“美国的新命令实际上是象征着美国大企业要在经济上扼杀英国的决心”。社论说，“在今天的情况下”，如果还忍气吞声地接受美国对英国贸易的禁令，“那就是不可容忍的和完全是自杀的行为”。
