Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, June 9th: Alan Weinington, a reporter for the London Workers' Daily, reported from Panmunjom on the 9th: Secret meetings that are progressing rapidly continue to be held here today. After the representatives of the two negotiating delegations met for twelve minutes, staff officers immediately held a meeting in the same room. All indications still suggest that documents to end this war can be signed soon. Syngman Rhee added a fake air raid on Seoul to his anti-armistice attacks last night, which cannot fool anyone. The United Nations military reporters here—whose residences were bombed last night—do not conceal today that they believe this air raid was carried out by Syngman Rhee as part of his cold war activities against the armistice, also wanting to stimulate some people to participate in his so-called "spontaneous" demonstration today. Syngman Rhee clamors to continue fighting after the armistice agreement is signed. How they can do this is a matter for the Americans who put this puppet on the stage in Korea to decide. The armistice agreement will be signed by Clark on behalf of the United Nations, not by Syngman Rhee. The agreement stipulates that the commanders of both sides prevent anyone from entering the demilitarized zone, order all armed forces under their control—army, navy, and air force—to cease hostilities, punish anyone who violates the agreement, and protect the personnel of the Joint Observer Group and neutral countries. The fact that Syngman Rhee's army cannot hold its main front even with full logistical support from the United States fully demonstrates how impossible Syngman Rhee's absurd dream of "advancing to the Yalu River" is.

Although Syngman Rhee's opposition to the armistice is not only a bargaining chip for this old public enemy of the Korean people, but also a major focus of their desperate struggle to prevent the armistice. The fact that this puppet is now more active only shows that the puppeteers are pulling the strings more urgently. Therefore, he is likely to attempt more barbaric provocations than last night's "air raid." However, there is no reason to believe that they can prevent or delay the rapid signing of the armistice agreement that the world is expecting. The plenary session is scheduled to continue tomorrow—still in secret. Continuing to maintain secrecy after the prisoner-of-war issue has been resolved indicates the possibility that what the world can expect is that once it is made public, the entire agreement that can be signed in a few days will have been completed.

    揭露李承晚破坏朝鲜停战谈判的阴谋
    【新华社开城九日电】伦敦工人日报记者阿兰·魏宁顿九日自板门店报道：今天此间继续在举行进展很快的秘密会议。在双方谈判代表团会晤了十二分钟后，参谋军官们立即就在同一房间里举行会议。一切迹象仍然表示着不久就可以签订结束这个战争的文件。李承晚昨夜在他的反停战的袭击活动中又添上了对汉城进行假空袭，这种假空袭骗不了任何人。此间的联合国军方的记者们——他们的住所昨夜受到空袭——今天并不隐讳他们认为这是李承晚所进行的空袭，作为他反对停战的一部分冷战活动，也是想由此刺激一些人来参加他今天的所谓“自发的”示威。李承晚扬言要在停战协定签字后继续作战，他们怎么能够做到这一点，这是把这个傀儡在朝鲜捧上台的美国人来决定如何办的事情。停战协定将由克拉克代表联合国签字，而不是由李承晚签字。协定规定双方司令官防止任何人进入非军事区，命令他们控制下的一切武装部队——陆、海、空三军——停止敌对行动，惩处破坏协定的一切人，保护联合观察小组人员和中立国人员。李承晚军队目前既有了美国的充分后勤支援，尚且不能守住他们的主要战线，这个事实充分说明了李承晚的“进军鸭绿江”是何等不可能实现的荒唐梦想。
    虽然，李承晚的反对停战，不只是作为这个老朽的朝鲜人民公敌的讨价还价的武器，更可作为他们阻止停战斗争中的垂死挣扎的主要焦点。这个傀儡现在更加活跃的事实，只是表示牵线者牵得更急促了。因此，他很可能企图进行比昨晚的“空袭”更野蛮的挑衅行动。但是，没有理由可以相信他们能够阻止或拖延全世界正在期望着的停战协定的迅速签订。全体代表会议准备在明天继续举行——仍旧秘密举行。在战俘问题解决后继续保持秘密这一事指出了这个可能，即：全世界所可期待的是：一旦公开时，可在数日内签字的全部协定已告完成。
