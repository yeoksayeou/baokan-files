    Xinhua News Agency, June 12th: At this moment when the Korean armistice is in sight, influential figures within the US ruling clique are busy declaring, one after another, that the United States will continue to pursue a policy of large-scale arms expansion and preparation for new wars after the Korean armistice.
    Even before an agreement was reached on the issue of prisoner of war repatriation, Republican leader Taft publicly suggested on June 5th the establishment of an aggressive alliance in the Far East. According to the Associated Press, Taft's proposal was supported by Senator Humphrey and Senator Alexander Wiley, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
    No sooner had the agreement on the repatriation of prisoners of war been reached than some senior US government officials eagerly expressed that the US government had no intention of abandoning its global arms expansion and war preparation plan because peace in Korea was in sight. US Secretary of Defense Wilson testified before the Senate Military Appropriations Subcommittee on the Eisenhower administration's massive arms expansion plan on the 8th, emphasizing that even if peace were achieved in Korea, the US military budget could not be cut. On the 9th, he defended the arms expansion plan before the Senate Appropriations Committee, saying, "Although there is a ceasefire, the war is not over." He repeatedly emphasized that the military budget should not be reduced further. Almost simultaneously, Eisenhower's assistant Adams and US Under Secretary of State Smith also issued similar statements one after another. According to Adams, the United States may be "in danger again" after the Korean Armistice Agreement is signed, so the arms expansion and war preparation movement should not be relaxed. Smith emphasized in a speech that "Korea is only a flank in the conflict surrounding the world," so the United States still "cannot relax."
    At the same time, the US arms expansion work is continuing. The US Department of Defense has ordered the Selective Service System to continue to induct 23,000 people into the army in August.

### 美统治集团的有势力分子宣称  美国在朝鲜停战后仍将推行扩军备战政策

    美统治集团的有势力分子宣称
    美国在朝鲜停战后仍将推行扩军备战政策
    【新华社十二日讯】在这朝鲜停战在望的时刻，美国统治集团中的有势力分子们一个接一个地忙着宣称，美国在朝鲜停战后仍然继续推行大规模扩张军备、准备新的战争的政策。
    还在战俘遣返问题达成协议以前，美国共和党领袖塔夫脱在六月五日曾公开建议在远东成立侵略性的联盟。据合众社报道，塔夫脱的建议得到参议员汉弗莱和参议院外交委员会主席亚历山大·维利的支持。
    遣返战俘问题刚刚达成协议，美国政府一些高级官员就迫不及待地表示美国政府无意因朝鲜和平在望而放弃它全球性的扩军备战计划。美国国防部长威尔逊八日在参议院军事拨款小组委员会上为艾森豪威尔政府的庞大扩军计划作证，强调：即使是朝鲜获致了和平，美国的军事预算也不能削减。九日他又在参议院拨款委员会为扩军计划辩护，他说：“虽然停了火，战争也并没有完结。”他一再强调军事预算不可再减。差不多同时，艾森豪威尔的助理亚当斯和美国副国务卿史密斯也先后发表同样的声明。据亚当斯说，朝鲜停战协定签字后，美国可能“又处在危险中”，因此不应松弛扩军备战运动。史密斯在一次演说中强调“朝鲜不过是围绕全世界的冲突的一个侧翼”，因此美国仍“不能松懈”。
    同时，美国的扩军工作正继续进行。美国国防部已下令征兵局在八月继续为陆军征调二万三千人入伍。
