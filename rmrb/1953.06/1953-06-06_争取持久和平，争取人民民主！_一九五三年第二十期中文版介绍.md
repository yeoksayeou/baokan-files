The organ of the Information Bureau of the Communist and Workers' Parties, "Strive for Lasting Peace, Strive for People's Democracy!" the twentieth issue of the Chinese edition for 1953 has been published.

This issue features an editorial titled "Struggle for the Unity of the Working Class - The Primary Task of the Communist and Workers' Parties," which states: The working people in capitalist countries, colonies, and dependent countries are continuously expanding their struggles to fight for their vital interests, safeguard and consolidate peace, and strive for democracy and national independence. The unity of the working class is the main prerequisite for the success of this struggle. The editorial goes on to say: Recently, in France, Italy, and several other capitalist countries, the Communist parties have achieved great success in uniting the working class and all democratic forces in the struggle to meet current demands, strive for democratic freedoms, and strive for peace and national independence. A characteristic of the growing strike movement in France is the increasing strengthening of the united action of the working class in the struggle to meet economic demands and strive for democratic freedoms. For the first time, the trade union organizations belonging to the French General Confederation of Labor, "Worker's Force," and the French Catholic Labor Confederation, as well as independent trade unions, have united to defend current demands in the Renault factory. In the recent municipal elections in France, the joint electoral lists of Communists and Socialists, proposed based on the minimum program suggested by the French Communist Party, won an absolute majority in dozens of municipal councils. Socialists and Communists also reached an agreement in the election of mayors and deputy mayors in several large cities. In Italy, millions of working people with different political views have united to oppose foreign imperialist enslavement of their country and oppose deceptive election laws. Many members of the Catholic Democratic Party and Social Democratic Party trade unions supported the recent twenty-four-hour strike by more than two million agricultural workers and peasants. In March, 200,000 railway workers in Italy participated in a forty-eight-hour general strike, which was also supported by the Social Democratic Party trade union. The leadership of the Catholic Democratic Party trade union, which undermined the strike, became isolated. In West Germany, Japan, India, Chile, and many other colonies and dependent countries, shining examples of the united action of workers from different parties and different trade unions can be seen. The editorial points out that the reason why some countries have achieved these successes in joint action is entirely because the Communist and Workers' Parties have waged an irreconcilable and unremitting struggle against the right-wing Social Democratic leaders and reactionary trade union bosses every day. Experience shows that the best and most effective way for the proletariat to successfully carry out the struggle for economic demands, democratic freedoms, peace, and national independence is to achieve mass unity in action. Communists must patiently and persistently explain the full significance of the unity of the working class ranks to the Socialist workers in a comrade-like manner, so that they can participate in the joint struggle to defend their vital interests. In order to constantly improve their organizational and ideological work, the Communist and Workers' Parties must wage an irreconcilable struggle against opportunist and sectarian tendencies.

This issue contains an abridged version of the speech delivered by Mátyás Rákosi, General Secretary of the Hungarian Working People's Party, at the voters' meeting in Budapest on May 10th, entitled "Towards New Victories, New Prosperity!" Rákosi analyzed how the People's Independent Front, headed by the Hungarian Working People's Party, had faithfully implemented the previous election program over the past four years, and pointed out the prospects of Hungary's second five-year plan. He talked about the changes that had taken place in the composition of the Hungarian population in the past four years, the achievements in the economic and cultural fields, criticized certain shortcomings in production and the overly complicated system of purchasing agricultural products, and pointed out to the Hungarian people how to do their own work well and fight for world peace. He pointed out that the Hungarian working class has not only increased in number, but also changed in terms of awareness, skills, and culture. More and more laboring peasants have embarked on the road of large-scale socialist economy. Intellectuals have eliminated their doubts about the people's democratic system, and the number of intellectuals from worker and peasant backgrounds has greatly increased. Therefore, the people of the whole country are united as never before. He called on the Hungarian working people to greatly improve labor discipline, increase labor productivity, eliminate waste, reduce costs, implement plans rhythmically, and be vigilant to eliminate certain phenomena of carelessness, complacency, failure to mention shortcomings, concealing shortcomings, or suppressing criticism. He pointed out that with a conscious and selfless working class, hardworking peasants and educated intellectuals, the help of the powerful Soviet Union, and the leadership of the Hungarian Working People's Party, the second five-year plan will surely be realized.

This issue publishes an article by R. Palme Dutt, Vice-Chairman of the Executive Committee of the British Communist Party, "Anglo-American Competition in the Middle East." In his article, Dutt recounted various events in the Middle East, analyzed the ebb and flow of British and American power and the increasingly acute contradictions between them, and pointed out that the people of the Middle East will ultimately determine the fate of the Middle East. This issue also published an article by W. Sokolski, Alternate Member of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party, introducing Polish literature and art: "People's Poland Struggles for Socialist Realism in Literature and Art." The author listed a large number of literary and artistic works, illustrating Poland's achievements, struggles, problems, and future directions in the struggle for socialist realism in literature and art.

This issue also published a letter from R. Ski from Guatemala, entitled "Struggling for the National Independence and Progressive Development of Guatemala." In addition, this issue published a brief report entitled "In the People's Republic of China," introducing the construction of New China and the improvement of workers' lives.

    “争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”一九五三年第二十期中文版介绍
    共产党和工人党情报局机关报“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”一九五三年第二十期中文版已经出版。
    本期以“为工人阶级的统一而斗争——共产党和工人党的首要任务”为题发表社论说：资本主义国家、殖民地和附属国的劳动人民，正在不断地扩大斗争来争取自己的切身利益，维护和巩固和平，争取民主和民族独立。工人阶级的统一是这个斗争获得成功的主要先决条件。社论接着说：最近在法国、意大利和其他若干资本主义国家里，共产主义政党在团结工人阶级和一切民主力量进行争取满足当前要求、争取民主自由、争取和平和民族独立的斗争中，已经赢得了巨大的成就。法国日益增长的罢工运动的一个特点是：争取满足经济要求和争取民主自由的斗争中，工人阶级的一致行动日益加强了。雷诺工厂中属于法国总工会、“工人力量”和法国天主教劳工联盟的工会组织以及独立的工会，已经第一次联合起来保卫当前要求。在法国最近举行的市政选举中，根据法国共产党建议的最低纲领而提出的共产党人和社会党人联合竞选名单，在几十个市政委员会中赢得了绝对多数。社会党人和共产党人在若干大城市的市长和副市长的选举方面，也达成了协议。在意大利，政治见解不同的千百万劳动人民已经联合行动起来，反对外国帝国主义奴役自己的国家，反对骗人的选举法。天主教民主党和社会民主党工会的许多会员支持了两百多万农业工人和农民最近举行的二十四小时罢工。三月间，意大利有二十万铁路工人参加了四十八小时的总罢工，这次总罢工也得到了社会民主党工会的支持。破坏这次罢工的天主教民主党工会的领导机构则陷于孤立。在西德、日本、印度、智利及其他许多殖民地和附属国里，都可以看到不同政党、不同工会的工人们一致行动的光辉范例。社论指出：若干国家所以能在联合行动方面取得这些成就，完全是因为共产党和工人党对右翼社会党领袖和反动的工会头子们每天都进行了不调和的和坚持不渝的斗争。经验表明，无产阶级要胜利地进行争取经济要求、民主自由、和平与民族独立的斗争，最好最有效的方法就是在行动中取得群众性的团结。共产主义者要以同志的态度耐心地和坚持不懈地向社会党劳动者解释工人阶级队伍团结的全部意义，使他们参加到保卫切身利益的联合斗争中来。共产党和工人党为了经常地改进它们的组织工作和思想工作，必须进行不调和的斗争，反对机会主义和宗派主义倾向。
    本期摘要刊载了匈牙利劳动人民党总书记马加斯·拉科西五月十日在布达佩斯的选民大会上的演说，题为“走向新的胜利，新的繁荣！”拉科西分析了以匈牙利劳动人民党为首的人民独立阵线在过去四年中忠实执行上届选举纲领的情形并且指出匈牙利第二个五年计划的前景。他谈到了四年中在匈牙利居民成份方面发生的变化，在经济、文化各方面获得的成就，批评了生产方面的某些缺点和收购农产品制度太复杂的缺点，给匈牙利人民指出如何做好本身工作为世界和平而斗争的方法。他指出：匈牙利工人阶级不仅在数量上增加了，而且在觉悟方面，在技能和文化方面也都有了改变。越来越多的劳动农民走上了大规模社会主义经济的道路。知识分子已消除了对人民民主制度的怀疑，工人和农民出身的知识分子大大增加。因此全国人民空前团结了。他号召匈牙利劳动人民大大改进劳动纪律，提高劳动生产率，消除浪费，降低成本，有节奏地执行计划，并且要提高警惕，肃清某些马虎疏忽、骄傲自满、不提缺点、掩饰缺点或压制批评的现象。他指出：有了有觉悟的忘我的工人阶级，勤劳的农民和有教养的知识分子，有强大的苏联的帮助和匈牙利劳动人民党的领导，第二个五年计划必然能够实现。
    本期刊载了英国共产党执行委员会副主席鲁·帕姆·杜德的文章“英美在中东的竞争”。杜德在他的文章中历述中东的各次事件，分析英美两国势力的消长和它们中间日益尖锐的矛盾，并指出中东各国人民终将决定中东的命运。本期还刊载了波兰统
