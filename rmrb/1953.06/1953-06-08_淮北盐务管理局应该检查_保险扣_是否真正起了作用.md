    Huaibei Salt Affairs Bureau Should Check Whether "Safety Buckles" Are Really Working

    A letter from Yi Yuan and Sang Lin: After the Huaibei Saltworks held a major safety and hygiene inspection last September, exciting news spread throughout the entire saltworks—in adding safety equipment, more than 140 million yuan was spent to install "safety buckles" and "safety sleeves" on all the windmills in the entire facility.

    The inspection summary of the Huaibei Safety and Hygiene Committee, as well as every report from the Party committee, administration, and trade union regarding the improvement of labor protection equipment, also recorded this achievement and reported it to the Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the East China Military and Political Committee.

    However, what is astonishing is that 80 percent of the workers do not use these "safety buckles" and "safety sleeves."

    When we visited the Lao Tangwei production team of the Xigang Institute of the Fangyang Saltworks, this team had a total of eleven windmills, and the "buckles" were nowhere to be found, and the "sleeves" were also scattered remnants everywhere. Salt worker Li Shoufa said, "I have used windmills for more than ten years and have never seen the 'dog's head' bite anyone." (The wooden gears of the windmill are commonly known as "dog's heads," and the "safety sleeve" is fitted on the "dog's head" to prevent accidents.)

    We asked, "According to you, is this 'safety sleeve' useless?"

    "Comrades, think about it, if the windmill awning were useful, why would we throw it aside?" another old worker replied to us in this way.

    A few days later, we passed through Xuwei Town and saw that three or four windmills by the roadside had "sleeves." We became suspicious again: "If it's really useless, why are they using it here?" Later, a worker told me, "The cadres from above have to pass by here when they go down to the salt fields. If you don't put the sleeves on, you will be criticized."

    He also told me: "When the windmill 'safety sleeves' were distributed, the workers raised objections to the saltworks, saying it was a waste. The production section chief of the saltworks took out an official document from the Huaibei Salt Affairs Bureau and said: 'What's the use of you raising objections? This is what the Bureau told us to do!'"

    We believe that if these safety buckles and sleeves are indeed necessary, the Huaibei Salt Affairs Bureau should go deep among the workers to publicize, mobilize, and educate them to use them; if these "buckles" and "sleeves" cannot play their due role because of poor quality, then effective measures should be taken to repair them.

### 淮北盐务管理局应该检查“保险扣”是否真正起了作用

    淮北盐务管理局应该检查“保险扣”是否真正起了作用
    毅远、桑林来信：去年九月间，淮北盐场举行安全卫生大检查以后，全场传开来一件轰动人心的大喜事——在增添安全设备中，花了一亿四千多万元，把全场风车装上了“保险扣”和“保险套”。
    淮北安全卫生委员会的检查总结，党委、行政和工会的每一份关于劳保设备改进的报告，也都记述着这项成绩，并且上报了中共江苏省委和华东军政委员会。
    可是，使人惊异的是这些“保险扣”和“保险套”，百分之八十的工人都没有用它。
    我们访问该场方洋场西港所老唐圩生产组时，这个组共有十一挂风车，“扣”儿都不晓得那儿去了，“套”儿也是残骸遍地。盐工李守法说：“我用了十几年的风车，没见过狗头咬人。”（风车的木齿轮俗称“狗头”，“保险套”是套在“狗头”上，防止发生事故。）
    我们问：“照你说这个‘保险套’子就没个用处吗？”
    “同志你想，那有用的风车蓬子，为什么我们不把它丢在旁边呢？”另一个老工人这样回答我们。
    过几天，我们路过徐圩镇，看见道旁有三四挂风车都有“套子”。我们又怀疑了：“要是真没有用，这儿怎么又用它呢？”后来工人告诉我：“上边干部下圩都要经过这里，不把套子套上可要挨责备。”
    他还告诉我：“当风车‘保险套’发下来时，工人向场里提意见说这是浪费，场里生产股长拿出淮北盐务管理局的公事说：“你们提有什么用？这是管理局叫办的！”
    我们认为：这些保险扣保险套如果确实必需，淮北盐务管理局应该深入工人中间宣传、动员和教育工人使用它；如果这些“扣”儿和“套”儿因为质量不好，不能起到应有的作用，那么应该采取有效的办法补就。
