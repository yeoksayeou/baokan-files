    Shanghai Factories Strengthen Planned Management, Exceeding May Tasks
    Several factories in Shanghai have completed and exceeded their May production plans.
    At the end of April and beginning of May, most factories in Shanghai summarized their production work for the first quarter and April, and discussed their May work plans, which played a role in promoting the completion of May's production tasks. The Pujiang Machine Factory mobilized the masses to discuss the May work plan at the beginning of May and promptly checked the implementation of the production plan. The Party Committee Secretary and the Factory Director frequently went deep into the workshops to understand the production progress and organized technicians to go to the workshops to assist workers in solving technical problems in production, ensuring the completion of the factory's plan. The Sanlian Motor Factory, which had failed to complete its production plan for four consecutive months, also exceeded its production plans for various products in May, except for some resistors, and also completed some of the tasks left over from March and April. The joint workshop of this factory used to formulate work plans very simply and did not mobilize workers to discuss them, so it never completed its tasks. In May, the joint workshop discussed the work plan and strengthened planned management, thus exceeding the task.
    Some factories have strengthened political work, consolidated labor discipline, and carried out mass-based commendations and criticisms in the process of completing their plans. The Wusong Machine Factory, through award evaluation, commended advanced units and individuals in production and criticized certain phenomena of lax labor discipline, giving play to the enthusiasm and creativity of the workers and staff. The Xinhu Steel Factory conducted a review of its past work in mid-May, summarized advanced experiences, and rewarded and commended advanced workers and staff, resulting in a new atmosphere in production. Shanghai Motor Factory, China Electric Company, Shanghai Steel Factory No. 2, and others improved the production enthusiasm of workers and staff through labor competitions. The first and second workshops of Shanghai Steel Factory No. 2 organized labor competitions between workshops and successively created seven new records.
    However, the situation of some factories not paying attention to production plans is still very serious. Although Shanghai Wire Factory improved product quality, it failed to complete its product plan for five consecutive months. Shanghai Tool Factory's production technology management is lax, and it has not completed its product plan for five months this year. In addition, Shanghai Steel Factory No. 1, Shanghai Smelting Factory, Huafeng Steel Factory, Chengfu Iron Factory, and others still have phenomena such as overtime work and conservative production plans. These factories must further improve the level of management work in strengthening planned management.

### 上海若干工厂加强计划管理  超额完成五月份任务

    上海若干工厂加强计划管理
    超额完成五月份任务
    上海市若干工厂已完成和超额完成了五月份的生产计划。
    四月底、五月初，上海市大部分工厂都总结了第一季度和四月份的生产工作，讨论了五月份的作业计划，这对于五月份生产任务的完成起了推动的作用。浦江机器厂在五月初发动群众讨论了五月份作业计划，并及时地检查生产计划的执行情况；党委书记、厂长经常深入车间，了解生产进度，并组织技术人员下车间，协助工人解决生产上的技术问题，使这个厂计划的完成得到了保证。连续四个月没有完成生产计划的三联电机厂，在五月份除一部分电阻器外，也超额完成了其他各种产品的生产计划，同时还完成了三、四月份留下来的一部分任务。这个厂的联合车间，过去制订作业计划非常简单，又不发动工人讨论，因此一向完不成任务；五月份联合车间讨论了作业计划，加强了计划管理，因而超额完成了任务。
    有些工厂在完成计划的过程中，加强了政治工作，巩固了劳动纪律，开展了群众性的表扬和批评。吴淞机器厂通过评奖工作，表扬了生产中的先进单位和先进人物，批评了某些劳动纪律松懈的现象，发挥了职工们的积极性和创造性。新沪钢铁厂在五月中旬把过去的工作做了一次检查，总结了先进经验，奖励和表扬了先进的职工，在生产上因而出现了新的气象。上海电机厂、中国电气公司、上海钢铁二厂等通过劳动竞赛，提高了职工的生产积极性。上海钢铁二厂第一、第二车间，组织了车间之间的劳动竞赛，先后创造了七次新纪录。
    但是，有些工厂不重视生产计划的情况还很严重。上海电线厂虽然提高了产品质量，但连续五个月未完成产品计划。上海工具厂生产技术管理松懈，今年五个月来都没有完成产品计划。此外，上海钢铁一厂、上海冶炼厂、华丰钢铁厂、诚孚铁工厂等，有的仍有加班加点现象，有的生产计划保守。这些工厂必须在加强计划管理工作中，进一步提高管理工作水平。
