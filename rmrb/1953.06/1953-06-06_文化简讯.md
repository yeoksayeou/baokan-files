    Jiangsu People's Broadcasting Station Launches Farmers' Program

    Since April, Jiangsu People's Broadcasting Station has launched a farmers' program to carry out propaganda and education work for farmers to organize, improve farming techniques, increase grain production, and support national industrialization. The radio station uses a variety of lively forms to promote mutual aid and cooperation, and labor competitions. After the station broadcast the news that Chen Yongkang Mutual Aid Group and 17 other units challenged farmers throughout the province, the Bie Xiaogang Agricultural Production Cooperative in Lianshui County immediately held a meeting of cooperative members, discussed and formulated the cooperative's annual production increase plan, proposed to accept the challenge, and challenged farmers throughout the province. The radio station continuously broadcast their challenges and responses, which played a certain role in promoting and encouraging mutual aid groups and individual farmers in various regions. The radio station also held programs such as "Agricultural Science and Technology Talks" and "Production Knowledge Talks" to help farmers learn a lot of production knowledge and improve production techniques. In two months, farmers directly wrote more than 140 letters to the radio station expressing their gratitude and making suggestions for improvement. Now, 546 districts and towns in 74 counties across Jiangsu Province have established radio listening stations; more than 120 fixed listening groups have been established in 16 counties, including Danyang and Suining. Starting in June, Jiangsu People's Broadcasting Station will further consolidate the radio network in rural areas, strengthen ties with listeners, and improve broadcast content based on the ideological situation and needs of farmers.
