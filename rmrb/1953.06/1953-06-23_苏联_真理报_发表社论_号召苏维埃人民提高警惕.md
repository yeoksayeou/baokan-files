Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, June 22nd: The "Pravda" published an editorial on the 21st entitled "Heighten the Vigilance of the Soviet People," stating: The people of all nationalities in the Soviet Union are engaged in peaceful and creative labor. They are consolidating the cause of world peace with their new achievements in economic and cultural development. It is perfectly natural that our country is an indestructible fortress of peace and the main force in preventing the preparation and launching of another war. The starting point of the Soviet Union's policy is that no international dispute cannot be resolved by peaceful means, and this policy is warmly supported by all those who cherish the interests of peace. However, some reactionary forces want to obstruct the peaceful settlement of disputes and prevent the easing of international tensions. Facts have clearly proven that these forces are capable of anything, and they are taking various measures to implement their sinister plans. The sabotage activities carried out by the intelligence agencies of the Atlantic aggressive bloc countries, especially the United States of America, against the Soviet Union and other peace-loving democratic countries clearly prove this. Therefore, Soviet men and women must be extremely vigilant and tirelessly and cautiously guard against the conspiracies of imperialist intelligence agencies. In addition, it must be taken into account that foreign intelligence agencies do not and cannot have any social basis in our country now. Therefore, they are gambling everything on using all kinds of thugs, traitors to the motherland, and former fascist executioners "inherited" by the American intelligence agencies from the German secret police, to implement their plans to carry out sabotage against the Soviet Union.

"Pravda" pointed out that the people recruited by the American intelligence agencies are trained in specialized "schools" established in Western Europe, especially the American-occupied areas of Germany. There, they are taught the "techniques" of sabotage, the use of terrorist means, intelligence gathering, and assassination. Then, these saboteurs and murderers are given weapons, poisons, radio transceivers, and forged documents, loaded onto American planes, flown into our airspace, and parachuted down. The editorial then recounted the fact that the Soviet Ministry of Internal Affairs captured and executed four American airborne agents in the Soviet Union in April this year, and emphasized that the same fate awaits all spies and saboteurs that foreign intelligence agencies attempt to smuggle into our country!

"Pravda" pointed out that smuggling specially trained spies and murderers into our country is only part of the large-scale sabotage activities carried out by the American intelligence agencies against the Soviet Union. It has been verified that these sabotage activities are all instigated by certain reactionary groups in the United States. On October 10, 1951, the United States Congress passed the so-called "Mutual Security Act," which stipulates that the U.S. government should allocate 100 million U.S. dollars for expenses for engaging in sabotage and subversion activities in the territories of the Soviet Union and people's democratic countries. On June 20, 1952, the U.S. Congress passed another bill, which not only stipulated the continued use of the funds allocated in the 1951 act, but also stipulated that funds allocated for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization could be used additionally as funds for sabotage and espionage activities. Recently, on May 5, 1953, the U.S. government submitted to Congress a bill on military aid to foreign countries for the next fiscal year, which also stipulates the allocation of funds for engaging in sabotage and other subversive activities against the Soviet Union and people's democratic countries. On June 13, American newspapers reported that the U.S. government had quietly obtained preliminary consent from Congress to allocate funds for the expenses of "anti-communist underground organizations" in Asia. The Senate and House committees that reviewed the foreign aid bill passed an allocation of 95.7 million U.S. dollars for engaging in such activities in Asia or Europe. Even the American bourgeois newspapers openly talked about the true purpose of the notorious "Mutual Security Act." For example, Leonard Nason, a military commentator for the "Stars and Stripes," wrote that he clearly knew that the United States was engaged in espionage and sabotage activities behind the Iron Curtain, and that these sabotage activities were so large-scale that so many were uncovered. The notorious Republican leader and Governor of New York State, Dewey, openly advocated establishing a complete anti-Soviet spy system. He claimed that for this purpose, the United States should not be picky about the people it hires. This kind of open confession is constantly heard in the U.S. Congress.

"Pravda" pointed out that the American reactionary groups that instigate and direct the American intelligence agencies to carry out sabotage against the Soviet Union are using every possible opportunity to dress themselves up as preachers and hypocritically talk about "morality," "humanity," and "moral standards." But is it moral to recruit spies and saboteurs from former prisoners of war, detainees, and exiles, to use all possible threats to make them traitors to the motherland, to train them as saboteurs and murderers in the secret agencies of the American intelligence agencies, and then send them to the territory of the country they betrayed in order to gather intelligence, blow up factories, and kill people? If this is a "moral" act, then what is an immoral and sinful act? Obviously, the purpose of reactionary bourgeois politicians talking about "humanity" and "morality" is to cover up the sinister sabotage activities carried out by imperialist intelligence agencies against peace-loving countries. They attempt to use this hypocritical preaching to paralyze the vigilance of the people of all countries and to frustrate their will to crush the conspiracies of the enemies of peace. "Pravda" emphasized that a reasonable conclusion can be drawn from this: the struggle to maintain and consolidate peace requires extreme vigilance. Soviet men and women know that several imperialist groups driven by selfish desires are attempting to make the international situation more tense and do not hesitate to use the most despicable means to achieve their goals. Therefore, our people must be vigilant and tirelessly guard against the conspiracies of the enemies of peace.

    苏联“真理报”发表社论
    号召苏维埃人民提高警惕
    【新华社二十二日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：二十一日“真理报”发表题为“提高苏维埃人民的警惕”的社论说：苏联各族人民正在从事和平的创造性劳动。他们正在以他们在经济和文化发展方面的新成就来巩固世界和平事业。这是十分自然的：我们的国家是不可摧毁的和平堡垒、是制止准备和发动另一次战争的主要力量。苏联的政策的出发点是：没有任何国际争端是不可以用和平方法解决的，这个政策受到了一切珍视和平利益的人们的热烈拥护。但是有些反动势力想阻挠争端的和平解决、不让国际紧张局势得到缓和。事实十分清楚地证明了，这些势力是什么事都干得出来的，他们采取各种手段来实行他们的罪恶计划。大西洋侵略集团国家，首先是美利坚合众国的情报机关对苏联和其他爱好和平的民主国家所进行的破坏活动清楚地证明了这一点。因此，苏维埃男女必须极度提高他们的警惕，不懈怠地、谨慎地防备帝国主义情报机关的阴谋。此外，还必须估计到，外国情报机关现在在我们国家没有而且也不可能有任何社会基础。因此，他们就孤注一掷地使用各种暴徒、祖国的叛徒，以及美国情报机关从德国秘密警察那里“继承”下来的前法西斯刽子手们，来实行他们对苏联进行破坏活动的计划。
    “真理报”指出：美国情报机关所招募的人们都在建立在西欧，特别是德国美占区的专门“学校”中受训。在那里，他们被教以破坏、施用恐怖手段、刺探情报和暗杀的“技术”。然后，这些破坏者和杀人犯都被授予武器、毒药、无线电收发报机、伪造的文件，装在美国飞机上，飞到我国领空，跳伞降落。社论接着追述了今年四月间苏联内务部在苏联捕获并枪决四名美国空降特务的事实，并且强调说：同样的命运等待着外国情报机关企图偷运到我国来的一切间谍和破坏者！
       “真理报”指出：偷运受过专门训练的间谍和杀人犯到我国来只不过是美国情报机关对苏联进行的大规模破坏活动中的一部分。经查明，这些破坏活动都是美国某些反动集团所教唆的。在一九五一年十月十日美国国会通过了所谓“共同安全法”规定美国政府拨款一亿美元，作为在苏联和人民民主国家领土上从事破坏和颠覆活动的费用。一九五二年六月二十日，美国国会通过了另一个法案，这个法案不但规定继续支用一九五一年法案的拨款，而且规定可以额外使用拨作北大西洋公约组织之用的款项，作为破坏和间谍活动的经费。最近，一九五三年五月五日美国政府向国会提出的关于下一会计年度给外国以军事援助的法案并规定拨出款项，作为从事对苏联及人民民主国家的破坏及其他颠覆活动的费用。六月十三日，美国报纸报道，美国政府已悄悄地获得国会的初步同意，可以拨款作为亚洲的“反共地下组织”的经费。审查援外法案的参议院和众议院委员会通过拨款九千五百七十万美元作为在亚洲或欧洲从事这种活动的经费。甚至美国的资产阶级报纸也公开谈论恶名昭著的“共同安全法”的真正目的了。例如，“星条报”的军事评论员伦纳德·纳逊写道，他清楚地知道，美国正在铁幕后面从事间谍和破坏活动，这些破坏活动的规模非常大，因此被破获的才有这样多。臭名远扬的共和党领袖、纽约州州长杜威公然主张建立一个完备的反苏间谍系统，他声称，为了这个目的，美国对它所雇用的人不应该仔细挑剔。在美国国会中不断听到这一类的公开招供。
    “真理报”指出，教唆并指导美国情报机关对苏联进行破坏活动的美国反动集团，正利用一切可能的机会装扮成说教者，并假惺惺地谈着“道德”、“人道”和“道德标准”。但是，由从前的战俘、被拘留的和被流放的人们中间招募间谍和破坏者，使用一切可能的威胁手段使他们成为祖国的叛徒、在美国情报机关的秘密机构中把他们训练成为破坏者和杀人犯，然后把他们送到他们背叛了的国家的领土，以便刺探情报，炸毁工厂和杀人，难道这是道德的行为吗？如果这是“道德”的行为，那末，什么才算是不道德的、罪恶的行为呢？显然，反动的资产阶级政客高谈“人道”和“道德”的目的是要掩盖帝国主义情报机关对爱好和平的国家进行的罪恶的破坏活动。他们企图用这种假惺惺的说教来麻痹各国人民的警惕性、来挫折他们的粉碎和平的敌人的阴谋的意志。“真理报”强调说：由此可以得出一个合理的结论：维护和巩固和平的斗争需要极度提高警惕。苏维埃男女知道，被私欲所驱使的若干帝国主义集团正企图使国际局势更加紧张，并不惜使用最卑鄙的手段来达到他们的目的。因此，我们的人民必须警惕地、不懈怠地防备着和平的敌人的阴谋。
