Commemorating the Fifteenth Anniversary of the Publication of "On Protracted War"
    Guo Hua Ruo

    Comrade Mao Zedong delivered a lecture entitled "On Protracted War" at the Anti-Japanese War Research Association in Yan'an from May 26 to June 3, 1938. It was an important theoretical weapon for the Chinese people to defeat Japanese imperialism in the anti-fascist war, a historically significant document in the Chinese people's revolutionary movement, and a great contribution to contemporary Marxist-Leninist military theory.

    In the early days of the War of Resistance Against Japan, precisely when "…the development of objective events has not yet fully exposed its inherent nature, and has not yet clearly presented its face to the people," the publication of Comrade Mao Zedong's brilliant masterpiece "On Protracted War" was of inestimable significance and effect. Based on the experience of past Chinese people's revolutionary wars and the new situation in China, Japan, and the world after the "September 18th" Incident, Comrade Mao Zedong, with his outstanding Marxist-Leninist viewpoints and methods, summarized the ten months of experience in the War of Resistance Against Japan, put forward convincing and sufficient arguments, used rigorous reasoning to analyze the enemy's and our own advantages and disadvantages and their changing trends and prospects, refuted the theory of national subjugation, criticized the theory of quick victory, and convinced those who were "still unclear and not firm, consolidating their confidence in the War of Resistance"; and proposed a complete set of urgent, practical, and correct guidelines and practices for adhering to protracted war to guide the war of resistance of the people of the whole country, especially the military and civilians behind enemy lines. Thus, under the brilliant light of Comrade Mao Zedong's masterpiece "On Protracted War," under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the Chinese people victoriously persisted in this War of Resistance Against Japan, which was "unprecedented in Eastern history and will be great in world history," and finally, in coordination with the Allied forces, especially the Soviet Union's dispatch of troops to Northeast China to fight against Japan, defeated the Japanese fascist aggressors. This was the first victorious war in the history of the Chinese people's national revolutionary war in a century. This war tempered the Chinese people, the Eighth Route Army, the New Fourth Army, and the Communist Party of China. It changed many things, changed the face of China in the past, and greatly promoted the development of Chinese history.

    In this War of Resistance Against Japan, the Kuomintang and the larger and better-equipped troops under its command were passively resisting Japan and actively opposing communism. Those who actively attacked the enemy and contained the Japanese aggression in the East were mainly the Eighth Route Army, the New Fourth Army, and the anti-Japanese guerrillas behind enemy lines in South China, the predecessors of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China. According to the instructions of Comrade Mao Zedong's "On Protracted War" and "Strategic Problems of Anti-Japanese Guerrilla Warfare," they carried out the War of Resistance Against Japan heroically and tenaciously. The Battle of Pingxingguan boosted the morale of the whole country and terrified the enemy. In the long years of the next eight years, without any assistance, under extremely difficult conditions such as the enemy's "three-all policy" (kill all, burn all, loot all), "iron-wall encirclement," and repeated "mopping-up operations," and under the triple attack of the Japanese army, the puppet army, and the Kuomintang anti-communist army, they fought more than 100,000 battles of all sizes with the enemy, resisting more than half of the Japanese army and more than 90% of the puppet army, eliminating more than 1.2 million Japanese and puppet troops, and winning over more than 100,000 Japanese and puppet troops to defect and revolt, greatly containing Japanese imperialism's aggression in the East. This also made a significant contribution to the anti-fascist war of the people of all countries in the world.

    The significance of "On Protracted War" to the Chinese revolution goes far beyond it becoming the decisive factor in guiding the victory of the War of Resistance based on objective conditions; it also lies in the fact that it mobilized and organized the democratic forces of the broad masses of the people during the War of Resistance, preparing a solid foundation for the great victory of the Chinese people in the future. In this speech, Comrade Mao Zedong profoundly analyzed the relationship between war and politics, pointed out the importance of "political mobilization for the War of Resistance," pointed out that "the army and the people are the foundation of victory," and thus determined the strategic policy of the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army: "Independent and autonomous mountain guerrilla warfare" and "Guerrilla warfare is the main form, but do not relax mobile warfare under favorable conditions." During the eight years of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army precisely carried out the instructions of this policy, boldly mobilized the masses behind enemy lines, expanded the anti-Japanese armed forces, and established and expanded the anti-Japanese base areas behind enemy lines, so that they could strike the enemy and persist in the War of Resistance; and when the Kuomintang reactionaries launched a nationwide civil war after Japan's surrender, and launched a heinous attack on the liberated areas, they were able to have the strength to repel their attacks, protect the fruits of victory, and also have the strength to launch a counter-offensive and achieve national victory.

    "On Protracted War" has such great power because it has inestimable value in theory. It is the result of the combination of Marxist-Leninist military theory and the practice of the Chinese revolutionary war, a summary and improvement of the experience of the Chinese people's revolutionary war - including the ten months of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the highest achievement in the history of Chinese military thought, and a great contribution to contemporary Marxist-Leninist military theory.

    "On Protracted War" has power because it represents the long-term interests of the broad masses of the people, and is loved, recited, and followed by the broad masses of the people. It is combined with the broad masses of the people, thus forming a great practical force. Its theoretical value lies first in the fact that it is Marxist-Leninist military theory, the military science of the working class. Based on the views of the Bolshevik Party on the theory and strategy of war, peace, and revolution during the First World War (1916), it distinguishes historical wars into two categories, just and unjust, and clearly expresses our Communist Party's different attitudes towards two different types of wars. We are opposed to imperialist wars of aggression, and the method of opposition is "to try our best to prevent their outbreak before the war breaks out, and after the outbreak, to oppose war with war and to oppose unjust war with just war whenever possible." To oppose imperialist oppression with national liberation wars. This is exactly the argument of Lenin in his book "Imperialism is the Highest Stage of Capitalism." Comrade Mao Zedong further developed the argument that "war is the continuation of politics by special means," following the perfect definition given to general warfare in his book "Strategic Problems of the Chinese Revolutionary War": "War - a supreme form of struggle that has begun since the existence of private property and classes, used to resolve contradictions between classes, between nations, between countries, and between political groups at a certain stage of development." ("Selected Works of Mao Zedong," Volume 1, page 168) In this book, he also gave an essential definition to the War of Resistance Against Japan, pointing out: "The Sino-Japanese War is not any other war, but a war to the death between semi-colonial and semi-feudal China and imperialist Japan in the 1930s." He pointed out that this is the basis of the whole problem. And from this, he derived the basic characteristics of the Sino-Japanese War, which are mutually contradictory, such as the enemy being strong and we being weak, the enemy being small and we being large, the enemy being backward and we being progressive, the enemy receiving little assistance and we receiving much assistance, and comprehensively analyzed these characteristics, rigorously listed the trends and prospects of these objective conditions in the struggle and development under our "new policy of resistance against Japan," and determined the three strategic stages of the War of Resistance Against Japan, and predicted that after the enemy's strategic offensive, there would be a relatively long period of strategic stalemate, and predicted that "interlocking" forms would appear in the war. And he pointed out: "This is a spectacle in the history of war, a great feat of the Chinese nation, and an earth-shattering undertaking." The entire practice of the War of Resistance Against Japan fully proved the correctness of this prediction and judgment. This is a far-sighted political and strategic prediction, because there is creative Marxism as the telescope and microscope of war. The guidelines and practices for adhering to the protracted war suggested in "On Protracted War," especially the strategy and tactics of the War of Resistance Against Japan, have national characteristics and the creativity of the working class, for example: using the form of mobile warfare in the strategic interior line, strategic protractedness, strategic defense, to strive to conduct offensive battles of the exterior line and quick decisions in battles and combat, and sometimes even the mutual coordination of the interior and exterior lines to encircle and annihilate the enemy, and to achieve the purpose of strategically consuming the enemy by annihilation battles in battles and combat. Therefore, this kind of mobile warfare mainly annihilates the enemy in its movement, allowing and requiring its own large-scale advance and retreat; "fighting without a rear." This is different from modern European-style mobile warfare. For example: elevating guerrilla warfare in the War of Resistance Against Japan from the category of tactics to the category of strategy, pointing out: "Guerrilla warfare in China's War of Resistance Against Japan... will perform an unprecedentedly great scene in the history of human warfare," "Without the assistance of guerrilla warfare, the enemy cannot be defeated"; guerrilla warfare must develop into mobile warfare, and in the "second stage of the War of Resistance, guerrilla warfare will rise to the main position, and mobile warfare and positional warfare will assist it." As for "...the mobile warfare in the third stage is not entirely borne by the original regular army, but will be borne by the original guerrilla army, which is raised from guerrilla warfare to mobile warfare, and perhaps a considerable part of it." Putting guerrilla warfare as a strategic stage, giving it the strategic task of developing into mobile warfare, and also requiring it to undertake a part of the strategic counter-offensive, this is a characteristic of the Chinese revolution and a new problem in the history of war. It was under the inspiration of this prediction that the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army made ideological preparations and organizational preparations for the counter-offensive, so that they were able to cooperate with the Soviet army's dispatch of troops to Northeast China in time, carry out the counter-offensive, eliminate the enemy, and expand the liberated areas, so that the population of the liberated areas increased from more than 95 million to more than 150 million, and the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army also increased from more than 900,000 to more than 1.3 million, which laid the foundation for the victory of the subsequent Liberation War. This speech "On Protracted War" demonstrates the great spirit and "heroic and forward spirit" of the modern progressive Chinese people in politics and strategy, and at the same time demonstrates revolutionary activeness, taking "eliminating the enemy" as the main purpose in war, and a high degree of tenacity, predicting that the War of Resistance Against Japan is a "difficult" protracted war, but not afraid of this difficulty, and having the confidence and determination to tenaciously persist to the final victory. This kind of spirit, this kind of ideological style, can only be the ideological manifestation of the new era, progressive people, and advanced class in a just war.

    The theoretical value of "On Protracted War" also lies in the fact that it is a revolutionary historical materialist view of war. It elaborates Lenin's argument that revolutionary war is a "driving force" that accelerates the historical process from a revolutionary point of view, pointing out: "...revolutionary war is an antitoxin, which will not only eliminate the enemy's poisonous flames, but also cleanse its own filth. ...It can transform many things, or open up roads for transforming things"; "The liberation of the Chinese nation will come from this war." It forcefully refutes idealism and mechanism in war with militant dialectical materialism, pointing out that these two erroneous viewpoints "are the epistemological sources of all erroneous viewpoints." It materialistically analyzes "the interrelationship of all factors between the enemy and ourselves" and comes to the conclusion of protracted war and final victory. Its guidance for war and battle, the choice of offense and defense, is not based on its own subjective wishes, but on the superior and inferior strength of the enemy and ourselves. Taking "enemy and ourselves" and "superior and inferior" as the material basis of "offense and defense" and "initiative and passivity," it points out: "War is a contest of strength, but strength changes its original form in the course of war. Here, subjective efforts, winning more battles, and making fewer mistakes are the decisive factors." This is a fundamentally different contrast with reactionary militarists. Those reactionary militarists "usually underestimate the enemy's strength and possibilities strategically, and overestimate their own strength," and are "rigid" tactically (Stalin's order issued on the Red Army Day in 1943). Hitler's attack on the Soviet Union and Japan's attack on China, "as usual," made this mistake, and now the US imperialist's attack on Korea is repeating this mistake "as usual," just like it used to instigate the Chiang bandits to attack the liberated areas, so its future can also be predicted to be "as usual." "On Protracted War" advocates materialism and opposes idealism, but also opposes mechanism, especially "the theory of weapons." It points out: "Weapons are an important factor in war, but not the decisive factor. The decisive factor is people, not things. The comparison of strength is not only the comparison of military and economic strength, but also the comparison of manpower and popular support. Military and economic strength must be controlled by people." And it emphasizes developing "conscious initiative," pointing out: "...everything is done by people,... To do well, one must first have people draw out thoughts, principles, opinions, and propose plans, policies, strategies, and tactics based on objective facts. ...All thoughts that are based on and conform to objective facts are correct thoughts, and all actions based on correct thoughts are correct actions. We must promote such thoughts and actions, and we must promote this kind of conscious initiative." Can it be said that these materialist arguments and outstanding propositions are only useful for guiding war, and have nothing to do with all other work, especially ideological work!

    The theoretical value of "On Protracted War" also lies in the fact that it is an outstanding military dialectic. It uses what Lenin called "the general dialectic...the method of explanation (research)" used by Marx and that we should learn (Lenin: "Talk about the Question of Dialectics") to study the Sino-Japanese War, first analyzing the most basic and most common contradictions in the Sino-Japanese War, thereby exposing all contradictions, analyzing the development of these contradictions from beginning to end, and proposing methods to solve these problems. Everyone knows that the first point of dialectics is: the absoluteness of contradiction, that is, the universality of contradiction. Lenin said: "The division of one into two and our understanding of its contradictory components... is the essence of dialectics," "Development is the 'struggle' of opposites" ("Talk about the Question of Dialectics"). "On Protracted War" elaborates on this point of view and affirms the absoluteness of "the enemy having loopholes to find," specifically pointing out that the Japanese Kou have committed five major mistakes in the ten months of war, thereby determining that there is "the possibility of taking advantage of the enemy's gaps." Everyone also knows that Comrade Mao Zedong's outstanding elaboration in "On Contradiction" is the particularity of contradiction. "On Protracted War" is concrete and vivid in this respect. Putting the Sino-Japanese War in the historical process of capitalist society and the imperialist era, especially the development stage of the 1930s, for observation and research. First, in the contradictions of this stage, find out the most basic and most common contradiction in the Sino-Japanese War, the contradiction between semi-colonial and semi-feudal China and imperialist Japan, and take this essential contradiction as the basis of the problem, thereby deriving the basic characteristics of the two countries, China and Japan, which are mutually contradictory, such as weak and strong, large and small, progressive and backward, and much assistance and little assistance, and pointing out: "War is a competition of these characteristics." In analyzing these contradictions, it is pointed out that the "strength" and "superiority" of the enemy and ourselves are relative. There is weakness in strength, strength in weakness, inferiority in superiority, and superiority in inferiority, which are all mutually permeated, and are also developing and changing, and when the development of the war "reaches a new certain stage, there will be great changes in the degree of strength and the situation of superiority and inferiority, and the result of the enemy's defeat and our victory will be achieved." According to the law of development of these contradictory struggles, it is scientifically foreseen the path that the changes in the strength of the enemy and ourselves will follow in the three strategic stages, especially estimating the changes in the situation of the enemy's superiority and our inferiority from the War of Resistance to the end of the first stage, China will have two different changes: "The first is downward," the second is upward. "The downward thing is the old quantity and quality, mainly manifested in quantity. The upward thing is the new quantity and quality, mainly manifested in quality." It is also estimated that the enemy also has these two downward and upward changes, but it is pointed out: "It must be estimated that the enemy's upward changes are temporary and local." Isn't this the most outstanding dialectical development view! For turning weakness into strength, turning defense into offense, opposing the theory of quick victory and the desperate efforts or fluke mentality of acute illness, and advocating relying on mobilizing the masses, transforming the army, accumulating victories in annihilating the enemy in battles and combat, using the annihilating and consuming nature of mobile warfare and guerrilla warfare to consume the enemy in large quantities, and promoting this gradual change of "quantity" to bring about the fundamental change of the strength of the enemy and ourselves, that is, the "qualitative" change in the strategic offensive and defensive situation of the enemy and ourselves, to achieve the strategic counter-offensive. The transformation of this possibility of development into reality is also specifically pointed out: "The superiority or inferiority of the war power itself is, of course, the objective basis for determining the initiative or passivity, but it is not the real thing of the initiative or passivity. It must go through struggle and the competition of subjective abilities before the de facto initiative or passivity appears. In the struggle, due to the correctness or error of the subjective guidance, it is possible to turn inferiority into advantage and turn passivity into initiative; it is also possible to turn advantage into inferiority and turn initiative into passivity. ...Initiative and victory can be obtained from the hands of the superior and the active, based on the real situation, through the active subjective ability, to obtain certain conditions, and by those who are inferior and passive." Can all of this be said to be just the creation of military theory, and not the development of materialistic dialectics! From this, it can be seen that the achievement of this masterpiece "On Protracted War" in the history of Chinese military thought is unprecedented; and its contribution to contemporary Marxist-Leninist military theory is also great.

    纪念“论持久战”发表十五周年
    郭化若
    毛泽东同志于一九三八年五月二十六日至六月三日在延安抗日战争研究会上，发表了“论持久战”的讲演。它是中国人民在反法西斯大战中战胜日本帝国主义的重要的理论武器，是中国人民革命运动中具有历史意义的文献，是当代马克思、列宁主义军事理论上伟大的贡献。
    在抗日战争的初期，正是“……客观事变的发展还没有完全暴露其固有的性质，还没有将其面貌鲜明地摆在人们之前”的时候，毛泽东同志的辉煌的巨著“论持久战”的发表，其意义与作用显然是难以估量的。毛泽东同志根据过去中国人民革命战争的经验和“九、一八”以后中国、日本和国际的新形势，以卓越的马克思、列宁主义的观点和方法，总结了抗日战争十个月的经验，提出令人信服的充足的论据；用严密的论理，分析了敌我的优劣条件及其变化的趋势与前途，痛驳了亡国论，批判了速胜论，说服了当时“还不明白和还不坚定的人们，巩固其抗战的信心”；又提出整套刻不容缓的、切实可行的、坚持持久战的正确方针与做法，以指导全国军民，特别是敌后军民的抗战。这样，中国人民就在毛泽东同志“论持久战”这一巨著的光辉照耀下，在中国共产党领导下，胜利地坚持了这一“在东方历史上是空前的，在世界历史上也将是伟大的”抗日战争，最后配合盟国特别是苏联的出兵东北对日作战，打败了日本法西斯侵略者。这是中国人民百年来民族革命战争史上第一次胜利的战争。这一战争锻炼了中国人民，锻炼了八路军、新四军，也锻炼了中国共产党。它改变了许多事物，改变了中国往日的面貌，大大地促进了中国历史的发展。
    在这抗日战争中，国民党和它指挥下的数量较多、装备较好的军队，是消极抗战、积极反共的。在抗战中积极打击敌人、箝制日寇在东方的侵略行动的，主要是在中国共产党领导下的八路军、新四军和华南等地敌后抗日游击队，即中国人民解放军的前身。他们根据毛泽东同志“论持久战”和“抗日游击战争的战略问题”的指示，英勇顽强地进行抗日战争。平型关一战，全国振奋，敌胆惊寒。以后八年的长期岁月中，在没有任何接济的情况下，在敌人“三光政策”、“铁壁合围”、反复“清乡”等极端困难的条件下，在日军、伪军、国民党反共军三方面的夹击下，和敌寇进行了大小十余万次的战斗，抗击了半数以上的日军和百分之九十以上的伪军，歼灭日伪军一百二十余万，争取日伪军投诚反正者十万余名，大大箝制了日本帝国主义在东方的侵略行动。这对于世界各国人民反法西斯战争，也给了重大的贡献。
    “论持久战”对中国革命的意义，远不止于它成为在客观条件基础上指导抗战取得胜利的决定因素，还在于它在抗战中动员并组织了广大人民的民主力量，准备了以后中国人民大胜利的坚强基础。毛泽东同志在这一讲演中，深刻地分析了战争与政治的关系，指出“抗日的政治动员”的重要性，指出“兵民是胜利之本”，并由此决定了八路军与新四军的战略方针：“独立自主的山地游击战”和“基本的是游击战，但不放松有利条件下的运动战”。八年抗战中，八路军与新四军正是执行这一方针的指示，在敌后放手发动群众，扩大抗日武装力量，建立并扩大敌后抗日根据地，因此才能够打击敌人，坚持抗战；而在日本投降以后，国民党反动派发动全国性的大内战，向解放区举行罪恶的进攻时，才能够有力量打退其进攻，保护胜利的果实，并且还有力量举行反攻，取得全国的胜利。
    “论持久战”之所以有这样伟大的力量，是因为它在理论上具有难以估计的价值。它是马克思、列宁主义的军事理论与中国革命战争实践相结合的成果，是中国人民革命战争——也包括十个月的抗日战争的经验的总结与提高，是中国军事思想史上的最高成就，是当代马克思、列宁主义军事理论上的伟大贡献。
    “论持久战”之所以有力量，是因为它代表广大人民的长远利益，而为广大人民所喜爱，传诵与奉行。它和广大人民相结合，因而形成了伟大的实际力量。它的理论上的价值，首先在于它是马克思、列宁主义的军事理论，是工人阶级的军事科学。它根据第一次世界大战时期（一九一六年）布尔什维克党在战争、和平及革命问题上的理论与策略的观点，把历史上的战争分清为正义的与非正义的两类，并明确地表示了我们共产党人对两类不同战争的不同态度。对于帝国主义的侵略战争，我们是反对的，反对的方法是“在战争未爆发前，极力阻止其爆发，既爆发后，只要有可能，就用战争反对战争，用正义战争反对非正义战争”。以民族解放战争来反对帝国主义的压迫。这正是列宁在“帝国主义是资本主义底最高阶段”一书中的论点。毛泽东同志又发展了“战争是政治的特殊手段的继续”的论点，继在“中国革命战争的战略问题”一书中所给予一般战争规定的完善的定义：“战争——从有私有财产和阶级以来就开始了的、用以解决阶级和阶级、民族和民族、国家和国家、政治集团和政治集团之间、在一定发展阶段上的矛盾的一种最高的斗争形式。”（“毛泽东选集”一卷，一六八页）在本书中，他又对抗日战争给予本质的定义，指出：“中日战争不是任何别的战争，乃是半殖民地半封建的中国和帝国主义的日本之间在二十世纪三十年代进行的一个决死的战争。”他指出，这是全部问题的根据。并由此引出敌强我弱、敌小我大、敌退步我进步、敌寡助我多助等中日战争中互相矛盾着的基本特点，全面地分析这些特点，严密地论列这些客观条件在我们“新的抗日政策”下斗争与发展的趋势和前途，断定抗日战争发展的三个战略阶段，预见到在敌人战略进攻之后会出现一个较长期的战略相持阶段，预见到在战争中会出现“犬牙交错”的形态。并指出：“这是战争史上的奇观，中华民族的壮举，惊天动地的伟业。”抗日战争的全部实践，完全证明了这一预见与论断的正确。这是远大的政治的战略的预见，这是因为有了创造性的马克思主义做战争的望远镜与显微镜的缘故。“论持久战”中所提示的坚持持久战的方针与做法，特别是抗日战争的战略战术，都具有民族的特点与工人阶级的创造性，例如：用运动战的形式在战略内线、战略持久、战略防御中，争取在战役与战斗中进行外线的、速决的进攻战，有时更以内线与外线的相互配合进攻，以求包围并歼灭敌人，以战役与战斗的歼灭战来达成在战略上消耗敌人的目的。因而这种运动战主要是歼灭敌人于其运动中，允许并要求自己大踏步的进退；“无后方的作战”。这就与现代的欧洲式的运动战有所不同。又如：把抗日战争中的游击战争，由战术的范畴提高到战略的范畴，指出：“中国抗日战争中的游击战，……将在人类战争史上演出空前伟大的一幕”，“没有游击战的辅助，也就不能战胜敌人”；游击战必须向运动战发展，到了抗战“第二阶段，则游击战将升到主要地位，而以运动战和阵地战辅助之”。至于“……第三阶段的运动战，已不全是由原来的正规军负担，而将由原来的游击军从游击战提高到运动战去担负其一部分，也许是相当重要的一部分。”把游击战作为一个战略阶段，给它以向运动战发展的战略任务，并且还要它担任一部分战略反攻，这是中国革命的一个特点，也是战争史上一个新的问题。八路军新四军正是在这种预见的启示下作了反攻的思想准备与组织准备，所以便能够及时地配合苏军的出兵东北，进行反攻，消灭敌人，扩大解放区，使解放区人口由九千五百余万增至一亿五千余万，八路军新四军也由九十余万人增至一百三十余万人，这就打下了以后解放战争胜利的基础。这篇“论持久战”的讲演，无论在政治上、战略上，都表现出现代进步的中国人民的伟大气魄，与“英勇向前的精神”，同时也表现出革命的积极性，以“消灭敌人”为战争中主要的目的，和高度的顽强性，预见到抗日战争是“艰难的”持久战，但不怕这种困难，而有顽强地坚持到最后胜利的信心和决心。这种精神气魄，这种思想作风，只能是新的时代、进步的人民和先进的阶级在正义战争中思想的表现。
    “论持久战”在理论上的价值，还在于它是革命的历史唯物主义的战争观。它以革命的观点发挥了列宁把革命的战争看成加速历史进程的“推动机”的论点，指出：“……革命战争是一种抗毒素，它不但将排除敌人的毒焰，也将清洗自己的污浊。……它能改造很多事物，或为改造事物开阔道路”；“中华民族的解放将从这个战争中得来”。它以战斗的辩证唯物论有力地批驳了战争中的观念论和机械论，指出这两种错误观点“是一切错误观点的认识论上的根源”。它唯物地分析“全部敌我因素的相互关系”，而得出持久战和最后胜利的结论。它对于战争和战役的指导，攻防的选择，也不是从自己的主观愿望出发，而是从敌我实力的优劣出发。把“敌我”“优劣”作为“攻防”和“主动、被动”的物质基础，指出：“战争是力量的竞赛，但力量在战争过程中变化其原来的形态。在这里，主观的努力，多打胜仗，少犯错误，是决定的因素。”这就同反动军事家成了根本不同的对照。那些反动军事家在战略上“照例是把敌人底力量和可能性估计不足，而把自己的力量估计过分”，而在战术上又“是死板的”（斯大林在一九四三年红军节发布的命令）。希特勒进攻苏联同日本进攻中国一样，“照例”地都犯了这种错误，现在美帝国主义的进攻朝鲜又同它过去指使蒋匪帮进攻解放区一样，也“照例”重复了这种错误，因此，其前途也可以预料得到一定是
    “照例”的。“论持久战”主张唯物论，反对观念论，但也反对机械论，特别是“唯武器论”。它指出：“武器是战争的重要因素，但不是决定的因素，决定的因素是人不是物。力量对比不但是军力和经济力的对比，而且是人力和人心的对比。军力和经济力是要人去掌握的。”并强调发扬“自觉的能动性”，指出：“……一切事情是要人做的，……。做就必须先有人根据客观事实，引出思想、道理、意见，提出计划、方针、政策、战略、战术，方能做得好。……一切根据和符合于客观事实的思想是正确的思想，一切根据于正确思想的做或行动是正确的行动。我们必须发扬这样的思想和行动，必须发扬这种自觉的能动性。”这些唯物的论点和卓越的命题，难道可以说仅仅对于指导战争有用，而对于其他一切工作特别是思想工作就无关吗！
    “论持久战”在理论上的价值，又在于它是杰出的军事辩证法。它运用列宁所说的马克思用过而应为我们学习的“一般辩证法……底说明（研究）方法”
    （列宁：“谈谈辩证法问题”）来研究中日战争，首先分析中日战争中最基本的、最平常的矛盾，从而暴露一切矛盾，分析这些矛盾自始至终的发展，并提出解决这些问题的方法。大家都知道辩证法的论点首先是：矛盾的绝对性，也就是矛盾的普遍性。列宁说过：“一分裂为二以及吾人对其矛盾组成部分的认识……，是辩证法底本质”，“发展乃是对立面底“斗争”（“谈谈辩证法问题”）。“论持久战”根据这种观点并发挥了它，不但深刻地分析了中日双方各种矛盾，又肯定“敌人之有岔子可寻”的绝对性，具体指出日寇在十个月战争中已犯了五大错误，从而断定有“乘敌之隙的可能性”。大家也知道，毛泽东同志在“矛盾论”中杰出的发挥是矛盾的特殊性。“论持久战”在这一方面的发挥是具体而生动的。把中日战争放在资本主义社会这一历史过程与帝国主义时代，特别是二十世纪三十年代这一发展阶段中来视察与研究。首先在这一阶段诸矛盾中找出中日战争中最基本的、最普通的、半殖民地半封建的中国和帝国主义的日本之间的矛盾，把这个本质的矛盾作为问题的根据，从而引出中日两国间弱强、大小、进步退步、和多助寡助等互相矛盾着的基本特点，指出：“战争就是这些特点的比赛”。在分析这些矛盾时，指出敌我“强弱”“优劣”都是相对的。强中有弱，弱中有强，优中有劣，劣中有优，都相互渗透着，也都在发展与变化着，在战争发展“到了新的一定阶段时，就将发生强弱程度上和优劣形势上的大变化，而达到敌败我胜的结果”。根据这些矛盾斗争的发展规律，科学地预见到三个战略阶段中敌我力量变化所将循的道路，特别是估计到从抗战到第一阶段末期敌优我劣的形势的变化，中国将有两种不同的变化：“第一种是向下的”，第二种是向上的。“向下的东西是旧的量和质，主要地表现在量上。向上的东西是新的量和质，主要地表现在质上。”又估计到敌人方面也有这两种向下和向上的变化，但指出：“必须估计敌人这种向上变化的暂时性和局部性”。这难道不是最卓越的辩证法的发展观吗？！对于转弱为强、反守为攻，反对速胜论与急性病的拼命主义或侥幸心理，而主张靠发动群众、改造军队，积累战役与战斗中歼敌的胜利，以运动战和游击战的歼灭性和消耗性，大量消耗敌人，把这种“量”的逐渐变化，来促使敌我强弱的根本变化，即敌我战略攻防形势上“质”的变化，而达到战略反攻。这种发展的可能性到实现性的转化，也被具体地指出：“战争力量的优劣本身，固然是决定主动或被动的客观基础，但还不是主动或被动的现实事物，必待经过斗争，经过主观能力的竞赛，方才出现事实上的主动或被动。在斗争中，由于主观指导的正确或错误，可以化劣势为优势，化被动为主动；也可以化优势为劣势，化主动为被动。……主动和胜利，是可以根据真实的情况，经过主观能力的活跃，取得一定的条件，而由劣势和被动者从优势和主动者手里夺取过来的。”所有这些，难道可以说仅仅是军事理论的创述，而不是唯物辩证法的发展吗？！由此可见，“论持久战”这一巨著，在中国军事思想史上的造就，是空前的；在当代马克思、列宁主义的军事理论上的贡献，也是伟大的。
