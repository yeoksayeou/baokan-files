    Two Agricultural Production Cooperatives in Dongxin Village
    Take the Lead in Selling Surplus Grain to the State
    Readers Yan Shi and Ma Linwen write: The peasants of the Xu Xianwen and Zhou Denglin Agricultural Production Cooperatives in Dongxin Village, Changling Third District, are to be commended for taking the lead in selling surplus grain to the state.
    Xu Xianwen, the director of the agricultural production cooperative, upon hearing from the director of the supply and marketing cooperative that their village sold the least grain, only reaching 40% of the supply and marketing cooperative's purchase plan, immediately convened a meeting of cooperative members on the evening of May 21st to discuss selling the cooperative's surplus grain to the state. He first explained the political significance of selling grain this time and then let everyone start a discussion. Cooperative member Chen Fulin said: "The state buys grain to support construction and also gives a 3% to 5% preferential treatment. If our agricultural production cooperative cannot take the lead in this regard, we would be too sorry to the state." Li Gaolin said:
    "Selling corn to buy some bean cake will also benefit our cooperative. Bean cake is a soft feed, and livestock likes to eat it." But some people had ideological concerns. Li Shutang said: "If we really sell the corn, what if the bean cake doesn't come through?" Then several people said that there were no other difficulties, just that the bean cake was worrying. When Xu Xianwen said that the supply and marketing cooperative guaranteed the supply of bean cake, everyone calculated the existing surplus grain in the cooperative and unanimously agreed to sell it to the state. Finally, Xu Xianwen pointed out that there would be a 5% preferential treatment if they gathered two tons. Everyone became even more enthusiastic. Zhang Yongjiu, a member of the management committee, immediately said: "I have 500 jin of surplus grain to sell to the state." Youth League member Wang Yutian said: "I also have 400 jin of surplus grain to sell to the state." Then some reported 1 *shi*, some reported 5 *dou*, totaling more than 4,000 jin. On the evening of May 21st, the Zhou Denglin Production Cooperative in the same village also held a meeting of cooperative members. After discussion, based on the principle of voluntary participation, the cooperative members and their families sold more than 8,000 jin of grain to the state.
    Many mutual aid teams and surplus grain households in the village also held meetings to discuss the issue of selling grain after hearing that the production cooperatives were selling grain.

### 东新村两个农业生产合作社  带头把余粮卖给国家

    东新村两个农业生产合作社
    带头把余粮卖给国家
    读者岩石和马林文来信：长岭三区东新村徐宪文和周登林两个农业生产合作社的农民，带头把余粮卖给国家，值得表扬。
    农业生产合作社主任徐宪文，听到供销社主任说他们村里卖粮的最少，卖给国家的粮数只达到供销社代购计划的百分之四十以后，立刻在五月二十一日晚上，召开了社员大会，商量把社内余粮卖给国家。他首先向大家讲了这次卖粮的政治意义，然后让大家展开讨论。社员陈福林说：“国家买粮是为了支援建设，并且还给百分之三到百分之五的优待。咱农业生产合作社，假如不能在这点上起个带头作用，也太对不起国家了。”李高林说：
    “卖了苞米买些豆饼，对咱社也有好处，豆饼是软料，牲口愿意吃。”但也有人有思想顾虑。李树堂说：“真要把苞米出了手，豆饼上不来怎么办？”接着有几个人都说没有什么别的困难，就是这豆饼叫人担心。当徐宪文说了供销社保证豆饼的供应以后，大家便计算了社内现有的余粮，一致同意卖给国家。最后徐宪文又指出凑足两吨就有百分之五的优待。大家更加踊跃了。管委会委员张永久立刻说：“我有五百斤余粮卖给国家。”青年团员王玉田说：“我有四百斤余粮也卖给国家。”接着有自报一石的，也有自报五斗的，算下来共四千来斤。同村周登林生产合作社在五月二十一日晚，也开了社员大会，经过商量，根据自觉自愿的原则，社员带家属，一共卖给国家八千多斤粮食。
    村内许多互助组和余粮户，听到生产合作社卖粮，也都开会讨论卖粮问题。
