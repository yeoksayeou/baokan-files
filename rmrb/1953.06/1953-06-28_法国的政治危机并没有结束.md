    The French Political Crisis is Not Over
    Tan Wenrui
    Since the Mayer cabinet fell on the 21st of last month due to the split of the parliamentary “majority,” the French government crisis has continued for more than a month. It was only on the 26th of this month that the French National Assembly barely authorized Laniel to form a cabinet. The revolving-door changes of French cabinets and the difficult birth of new cabinets after the fall of the old ones were already commonplace. However, at a time when the international situation is undergoing important changes, the fact that it has taken France so long to produce a cabinet shows that this government crisis in France is more serious than any previous one. The old French politician Herriot also sighed and said: "I can't remember when France has encountered such a bad government crisis as it is now!"
    After the fall of the Mayer cabinet, Guy Mollet of the right-wing Socialist Party and Diethelm of the "Rally of the French People" retreated, knowing they could not succeed, and successively refused the invitation to form a cabinet. Paul Reynaud of the "Independent Republicans," Mendès-France of the Radical Socialist Party, and Bidault of the Catholic "Popular Republican Movement" successively attempted to form a cabinet, but none of them were able to obtain the required majority in the parliament and declared failure. André Marie of the Radical Socialist Party once tried to regroup and carried out a series of lobbying activities, but he was also unable to succeed. Therefore, French President Auriol had to convene a meeting of leaders of various right-wing parties, intending to win them over and form a so-called "national alliance" as the basis for the emergence of a new cabinet. After several days of haggling, the leaders of the various right-wing parties agreed on a so-called "minimum program," and the President then asked former Prime Minister Pinay to form a cabinet again, but the result was still inevitable failure. Finally, the reactionary capitalist Joseph Laniel came forward and pieced together a new cabinet with the support of the most right-wing parties in the National Assembly.
    People know that the Mayer cabinet, like all previous cabinets in France after the war, was forced to resign because it could not overcome the financial and economic difficulties it faced. This is the result of the French ruling group pursuing a policy of subservience to the American war policy. The fall of the Mayer cabinet once again shows that any cabinet in France, if it does not fundamentally change its current policy, cannot avoid a short-lived fate. The reason why the French ruling group has been unable to put together a cabinet for a long time is because, facing the critical economic situation in France, the rising strength of the people, and the huge international call for a peaceful settlement of international disputes, they cannot come up with a clear policy. The French Communist Party once pointed out: to end the French government crisis, only a new policy can be adopted. French public opinion also believes that the problem is to change policies, not to change prime ministers. However, the French ruling group violates the will of the people, has no intention of breaking away from its subservience and dependence on the United States, and attempts to establish a more reactionary government to ensure the continued implementation of policies that will push France towards disaster. This is the reason why Joseph Laniel, a reactionary capitalist who is also an official and a businessman, has come forward to lead the organization of the nineteenth cabinet in France after the war.
    We know that Laniel has always advocated "international cooperation" and "strong defense" with the United States. In his speech requesting authorization from the parliament, he also stated that he would "follow the policies that France has pursued so far" and that he "remains faithful to the Atlantic Alliance." Regarding the colonial war in Vietnam, he only vaguely said: "My government will relentlessly seek opportunities to end this war." All of this determines that Laniel's government will continue to implement policies of aggression and war preparations. Such a government will inevitably be unable to overcome the extremely serious economic crisis facing France. The financial and economic situation in France has deteriorated to such an extent that even the leaders of the various right-wing parties in France have had to admit that France is on the verge of bankruptcy. In his speech requesting authorization from the parliament, Pidault of the Catholic "Popular Republican Movement" said: "At the end of each month, the country has a deficit of 50 to 60 billion francs. Our payments to the European Payments Union have reached a huge figure of 750 million US dollars today. We have to pay 30 to 50 million US dollars to foreign countries every month. If the national treasury has no extra income, we really cannot get through the end of June." Another contender for the new premiership, Renault of the "Independent Republicans," predicted that next year's budget deficit may rise from the current 730 billion to 1 trillion francs; and exclaimed that monetary reserves were shockingly low and that the value of the franc had lost nine-tenths. It is well known that this is the result of the French ruling group succumbing to the American war policy, carrying out the war of aggression against Vietnam, and undertaking the huge arms expansion tasks of the North Atlantic aggressive bloc. France's military adventure in Vietnam spends more than 600 billion francs in military expenditure every year; the implementation of the American arms expansion and war preparation plan devours another several hundred billion francs in military expenditure, which is bound to create a huge and unfillable deficit in the budget. As the French "Liberation Daily" said, "Most French people believe that as long as France continues to bear the heavy burden of the Indochina war and the expansion of armaments, it will be fundamentally impossible to carry out economic, financial, and political recovery."
    The French ruling group still hopes to rely on American "aid" to solve its difficulties. When Laniel requested authorization, he also stated that he was prepared to raise the issue at the Bermuda Conference, requesting the United States to share the heavy burden of the French war of aggression against Vietnam. But facts have already proven that France's attempt to obtain the "aid" it needs from the United States is undoubtedly like seeking the skin of a tiger. At the end of last year, there was a fierce dispute between the United States and France over military orders. In March of this year, the former French Prime Minister Mayer personally went to the United States to beg for aid. He requested the United States to provide one billion US dollars in aid to share 65% of the French war expenses for the war of aggression against Vietnam; but the United States demanded that France cede control over Indochina and only promised to give France 400 million US dollars in "aid." At that time, the Paris "Combat" reflected the disappointment of the French bourgeoisie and said: "For France, people have not promised it anything, but instead demand that it give up everything - even its honor and life."
    The French ruling group's wishful thinking is to place the burden of the economic crisis and arms expansion on the broad masses of the people. They attempt to tighten their exploitation and plunder of the people by continuously reducing civil affairs expenditures and increasing taxes to alleviate the government's financial difficulties. But such a calculation will not be successful. This is a way of cutting flesh to heal sores, which will only deepen the poverty and hunger of the people and further aggravate the economic crisis. Moreover, Laniel's history tells us that this new Prime Minister is an old hand at speculation. He once used the stimulation of the cabinet crisis to engage in large-scale black market trading of the franc, causing the black market price of the franc to fall from 408 francs per US dollar to 414 francs. It is not difficult for us to predict whether this "new" government will bring a stable economy to France or a further deteriorating economic situation.
    Since the French "new" government cannot overcome the economic crisis it faces, it will certainly not be able to overcome the political crisis it faces. We know that with the development of the situation at home and abroad in France, the broad masses of the French people are increasingly strongly demanding a fundamental change in the current domestic and foreign policies, demanding an end to the harmful and hopeless war in Vietnam, stopping arms expansion and war preparations, refusing to participate in the so-called "European Defense Community," and breaking free from the shackles of the United States. If the French ruling group continues to implement its current disastrous policies, it will inevitably be resolutely resisted by the broad masses of the people, making France's internal contradictions more acute and creating an increasingly serious political crisis for the French ruling class. The recent results of the French municipal elections have shown the powerful development of the strength of the French people.
    Some more clear-headed people in the French ruling group have seen the hopeless future of the war of aggression against Vietnam and the disastrous consequences of arms expansion and war preparations, and have begun to feel uneasy about the current policy of following the United States. Some right-wing politicians waving the banner of the middle ground, because they take into account the strong feelings of the people against war and hunger, dare not openly express support for some blatant policies and measures that violate the interests of the people. The differences of opinion within the French ruling group have long been reflected in the long and fierce debate in the parliament on the issue of approving the "European Army." In this government crisis, the internal chaos of the French ruling group is even more apparent. In the various authorization votes in the parliament, not only did the various right-wing party groups deviate from each other, but also many right-wing party groups were inconsistent in their voting, and many members of parliament did not follow their party leaders. Therefore, the various right-wing parties could not successfully gather a new "majority" for a long time. The outgoing Minister of Defense, Plevin, also admitted that "there are huge differences in the parliament on foreign policy and French federal policy," which is "one of the special difficulties of this crisis." Since the Laniel government wants to continue to follow the American war policy, it must guarantee to the United States that France can approve the "European Army" treaty as soon as possible. However, past facts have shown that because the French people firmly oppose this war treaty that betrays the national interests of France, among the more than 500 members of the French National Assembly, more than 300 oppose the ratification of the "European Army" treaty. Although the United States continues to exert pressure, coercing France and other signatory countries to quickly obtain ratification of the "European Army" treaty, the Foreign Affairs Committee of the French National Assembly passed a resolution in the middle of last month indefinitely postponing the discussion on the "European Army" treaty. It will not be without difficulty for the Laniel government to approve the "European Army" treaty, satisfy the United States, and receive more dollars.
    The French government crisis is a reflection of the crisis of the North Atlantic aggressive bloc. It irrefutably proves that the war policy pursued by the United States in Western Europe has suffered a shameful failure. This policy not only brings endless disasters to the people of Western Europe, but also creates insurmountable financial, economic, and political difficulties for the vassal states of the United States. The French political crisis, the great victory of the Italian democratic forces in the elections, and the increasingly deep-rooted Soviet peace policy in Western Europe have caused the warmongers in the American ruling group to feel deeply worried. The American "New York Times" said: "The political situation in Europe is changing, and it seems that its trend will be unfavorable to American policies and interests. ... Unless this trend is stopped, it will be a bad omen for the entire political and strategic policy of the United States and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization." The British "Observer" believes that the situation in Europe shows "the disintegration of the Cold War front." Although the leaders of the right-wing parties in France are still shouting: "My government will definitely affirm France's loyalty to the Atlantic Alliance," Washington has already seen that the strength on which the American Cold War policy relies is "declining." Laniel's authorization is probably also difficult to make the American ruling group feel relieved.
    It should be pointed out that the current international situation is conducive to France breaking free from the shackles of the United States and seeking a path of independent development. Since the Soviet Union proposed a peaceful initiative to resolve international disputes through consultation, the movement to strive for easing tensions has gradually developed in various countries, and this movement is also widely supported in France. France should, in this movement for peaceful consultation, end its disastrous war of aggression against Vietnam and its arms expansion and war preparation movement, and adopt a wise policy that conforms to the interests of the French people. Now, the broad masses of the French people are warmly responding to the call of the French Communist Party, demanding the establishment of a government that safeguards peace, national independence, democracy, and social progress. This is the only way out for France. The French ruling group, of course, has no intention of choosing such a path. On the contrary, the various right-wing parties of the French ruling group are colluding, attempting to use fascist measures such as amending the constitution and expanding the power of the government to maintain its rule. The result of doing so will not only not eliminate the French political crisis, but on the contrary, it will only further deepen the French political crisis.

    法国的政治危机并没有结束
    谭文瑞
    自从迈耶内阁因为议会“多数派”的分裂而于上月二十一日倒台后，法国的政府危机延续了一个多月，到本月二十六日法国国民议会才勉强授权拉尼埃出来组阁。法国内阁走马灯式的更迭，以及内阁倒台后新阁的难产，本来已屡见不鲜。但是，在今天国际局势正发生着重要变化的时候，法国却这样久才产生出一个内阁来，这说明法国的这次政府危机，比起过去任何一次都要严重得多。法国的老政客赫里欧也感叹地说：“想不起来法国什么时候碰到过像现在这样糟糕的政府危机！”
    迈耶内阁倒台之后，右翼社会党的居伊·摩勒和“法兰西人民联盟”的迪埃德姆知难而退，先后拒绝了组阁的邀请。“独立共和党”的保罗·雷诺、激进社会党的孟戴斯——弗朗斯和天主教“人民共和党”的皮杜尔相继尝试组阁，都没有能得到议会中所需的多数票而宣告失败。激进社会党的安德烈·马里曾试图重整旗鼓，进行了一番拉拢活动，也没有能够成功。于是法国总统阿里奥尔不得不召集各右翼党派领袖举行会议，打算从中拉拢，组成一个所谓“全国联盟”，作为产生新阁的基础。各右翼党派领袖经过了几天的讨价还价，商定了一个所谓 “最低纲领”，总统便再请前任总理比内组阁，结果还是不免失败。最后才由反动资本家约瑟夫·拉尼埃出头，在国民议会中各个最右翼的党派支持下凑成了一个新内阁。
    人们知道，迈耶内阁是和法国战后历届内阁一样，由于无法克服它所面临的财政经济困难而被迫辞职的。而这是因为法国统治集团奉行屈从美国战争政策的结果。迈耶内阁的倒台，再一次说明法国任何一个内阁，如果不根本改变现行的政策，就无法避免短命的厄运。法国统治集团之所以长久拼凑不成一个内阁，就是因为它们面对着法国国内危急的经济情况和高涨的人民力量，以及国际间要求和平解决国际争端的巨大声浪，拿不出一个明确的政策来。法国共产党曾经指出：要结束法国的政府危机，只有采取一种新的政策。法国的舆论也认为，问题是要更换政策，而不是更换总理。但是法国的统治集团却违反人民的意志，无意摆脱对美国的屈从和依赖，企图成立一个更加反动的政府，来保证继续执行把法国推向灾难的政策。这就是亦官亦商的反动资本家拉尼埃出来领衔组织法国战后的第十九届内阁的缘由。
    我们知道拉尼埃是一向主张和美国实行“国际合作”以及“坚强的防御”的。在他要求议会的授权演说中，也表示他将“遵循着法国奉行迄今的政策”，他“仍然忠实于大西洋联盟”。关于在越南进行的殖民战争，他也只是含糊地说：“我的政府将毫不松懈地寻求结束这个战争的机会。”这一切就确定了拉尼埃的政府将继续执行侵略和备战的政策。这样的政府，必然不可能克服法国目前极端严重的经济危机。法国的财政经济情况已经恶化到这样的地步，甚至法国各右翼政党的领袖都不得不承认法国已濒于破产的边缘。天主教“人民共和党”的皮杜尔在要求议会授权时所发表演说中就说到：“每个月月底国家都亏空五、六百亿法郎。我们在欧洲支付同盟的赤字到今天已经达到七亿五千万美元的庞大数字。我们每月都要付给外国三千万到五千万美元。如果国库没有额外收入，我们的确无法度过六月底。”另外一个新总理的角逐者“独立共和党”的雷诺则预料：明年的预算赤字可能要从目前的七千三百亿上升到一万亿法郎；并且惊呼货币储备少得惊人，法郎价值已经丧失了十分之九。人所共知，这是由于法国统治集团屈从美国战争政策，进行侵略越南战争和承担北大西洋侵略集团的庞大扩军任务的结果。法国在越南的军事冒险，每年耗费六千亿以上法郎的军费；执行美国的扩军备战计划，又吞噬另外数千亿法郎的军事开支，因而必然要造成预算中无法弥补的巨大赤字。正如法国“解放报”所说的，“大多数法国人都相信：只要法国继续担负印度支那战争和扩张军备的沉重负担，那就根本不可能进行经济、财政和政治的恢复工作。”
    法国统治集团仍然指望依靠美国的“援助”来解救它的困难，拉尼埃要求授权时也表示，准备在百慕大会议上提出，要求美国分担法国侵越战争的沉重负担。但是事实已经证明，法国想从美国得到它所需要的“援助”，无疑是与虎谋皮。去年年底，美法之间就为了军事订单发生过一场激烈的争吵。今年三月间，法国前任总理迈耶亲自赴美乞援，他
    要求美国给予十亿美元的援款，替法国分担百分之
    六十五的侵越战费；但美国要求法国出让对印度支
    那的控制权，只答应给法国四亿美元的“援助”。
    巴黎“战斗报”当时反映法国资产阶级的失望情绪说：“对于法国，人家什么东西都没答应给它，但反而要求它放弃所有的东西——甚至于它的荣誉与生命。”
    法国统治集团的如意算盘，就是把经济危机和扩军备战的重担放在广大人民的身上。他们企图以不断削减民政费用和增加捐税的办法加紧榨取和掠夺人民，来减轻政府在财政上的困难。但这样的算盘是不会如意的，这是一种挖肉补疮的办法，只会加深人民的贫困和饥饿，将使经济危机进一步加剧。而且拉尼埃的历史告诉我们，这位新总理是个专做投机生意的老手。他曾利用内阁危机的刺激，大做法郎的黑市买卖，使法郎的黑市价格从一块美元合四百零八法郎落到四百十四法郎。我们不难预料这个“新”政府将带给法国的是稳定的经济还是更恶化的经济情况了。
    法国的“新”政府既然不能克服它所面对的经济危机，也就一定不能克服它所面对的政治危机。我们知道随着法国国内外局势的发展，法国广大人民愈来愈强烈地要求根本改变现行的内政和外交政策，要求结束有害而无望的越南战争，停止扩军备战，拒绝参加所谓“欧洲防务集团”，挣脱美国的束缚。法国的统治集团如果继续执行现行的灾难政策，必然要遭到广大人民坚决的反抗，使法国的内部矛盾更加尖锐起来，造成法国统治阶级日益严重的政治危机。最近法国市选的结果，已显示了法国人民力量的强大发展。
    法国统治集团中一部分头脑比较清醒的人，看到了侵越战争的绝望前途，以及扩军备战的灾难性后果，对现行追随美国的政策开始感到不安。一些打着中间旗帜的右翼政客，因为考虑到人民反对战争与饥饿的强烈情绪，对于一些露骨的违反人民利益的政策和措施，也不敢公然表示支持。法国统治集团内部的意见分歧，早就表现在议会对“欧洲军”批准问题的长期激烈争吵之中。在这次政府危机当中，法国统治集团内部是更显得混乱了。在议会的各次授权投票中，不仅各右翼党团之间互相背离，而且许多右翼党团的内部在投票时也不一致，很多议员都不追随他们的党团领袖，因此各右翼党派长久不能纠集成功一个新的“多数派”。下了台的国防部长普利文也曾承认：“议会里在外交政策和法兰西联邦政策上存着巨大分歧”，是“这次危机的特殊困难之一”。拉尼埃政府既然要继续追随美国的战争政策，它就必须向美国保证法国能够早日批准“欧洲军”条约。然而，过去的事实说明，由于法国人民坚决反对这一出卖法国民族利益的战争条约，在法国国民议会的五百多名议员中，就有三百多名反对批准“欧洲军”条约。尽管美国不断施以压力，胁迫法国及其他签字国必须赶快使“欧洲军”条约获得批准，法国国民议会的外交委员会却于上月中旬通过了决议，无限期搁置关于“欧洲军”条约的讨论。拉尼埃政府要想批准“欧洲军”条约，使得美国满意，多施舍一些美元，也不会是没有困难的。
    法国政府危机，正是北大西洋侵略集团危机的反映。它无可辩驳地证明了，美国在西欧推行的战争政策已遭到了可耻的失败。这种政策不仅给西欧的人民带来无穷的灾难，而且给美国的仆从国家造成无法克服的财政、经济和政治上的困难。法国的政治危机，意大利民主力量在选举中的巨大胜利，苏联和平政策在西欧日益深入人心，已使美国统治集团中的好战分子深感忧虑。美国“纽约时报”说：“欧洲的政治局面正在起着变化，看来它的趋势对美国的政策与利益是会不利的。……除非这种趋势受到制止，否则它对美国整个政治和战略政策以及北大西洋公约组织都是一种凶兆。”英国“观察家报”认为欧洲的局势显示着“冷战战线的瓦解”。尽管法国的右翼政党领袖还在空喊：“我的政府将肯定法国忠于大西洋联盟”，但是华盛顿方面却已看到了美国冷战政策所赖以支持的力量“正在衰退下去”了。拉尼埃的获得授权，恐怕也难使美国的统治集团宽心些。
    应该指出：目前的国际形势，是有利于法国摆脱美国的束缚，而谋求独立发展的道路的。自从苏联提出协商解决国际争端的和平倡议，争取缓和紧张局势的运动便在各国日渐发展起来，这一运动在法国国内也同样受到广泛的支持。法国应该在这个和平协商的运动中，终止它招致灾难的侵越战争和扩军备战运动，采取一种符合法国人民利益的明智政策。现在法国广大人民正热烈响应法国共产党的号召，要求成立一个维护和平、民族独立、民主和社会进步的政府。这是法国唯一的出路。法国的统治集团当然无意选择这样的一条道路。相反的，法国统治集团各右翼政党竟从事勾结，企图以修改宪法、扩大政府权力等法西斯措施，来维持它的统治。而这样做的结果，不但不能消除法国的政治危机，相反的，它只会使法国的政治危机更进一步加深了。
