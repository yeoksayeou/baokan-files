    Leading Elementary School Students in After-School Activities Requires Attention to Safety
    Editor's Note: Readers Kang Ziyi, Liang Guofan, and others have written to report that the Dicun Central Elementary School in the suburbs of Taiyuan City and the Chencun Elementary School in the first district of Jiang County, Shanxi Province, organized students for after-school labor, and serious casualties occurred due to neglecting safety. This is a painful lesson that should be universally valued by elementary school educators in various regions.
    (I)
    Kang Ziyi, Wang Zhao, and others from Dicun, suburbs of Taiyuan City, wrote: On the afternoon of April 15th, Li Yulun, the principal of Dicun Central Elementary School, instructed teachers Yang Guilin and Tao Lansheng to lead more than 100 students from the whole school to move soil from a kiln at Baobuzui in the village during after-school activities. The cliff at Baobuzui kiln was more than two zhang (approximately 20 feet) high, and the situation was very dangerous. Usually, the villagers did not dare to dig soil there. At that time, villager Huang Xi tried to dissuade them, but Yang Guilin and Tao Lansheng ignored him. Later, a farmer named Wang Lazhu told them, "There is already a crack more than a foot long on the top of the cliff, don't dig anymore!" Yang Guilin and others still did not listen and continued to take the students to dig the soil. As a result, less than ten minutes after they started digging, there was a roar, and a large piece of cliff soil collapsed. At this time, dust filled the sky, and the elementary school students cried in a panic. After the dust settled, it was only discovered that two students were half-buried in the soil. They rescued the two students and took the team back to school. When they returned to school and checked the number of people, they found that two students were missing. Later, although they were dug out of the soil, they could no longer be saved.
    After this incident occurred, the villagers were very dissatisfied, and the parents of the deceased were extremely grief-stricken. Although the village held two large meetings to solicit opinions from everyone, it has been more than a month and no action has been taken. It is suggested that the Taiyuan Municipal People's Government should quickly send people to investigate and take appropriate action.
    (II)
    Liang Guofan from the first district of Jiang County, Shanxi Province, wrote: On the afternoon of May 21st, Xu Zhenzhi, a teacher at Chencun Elementary School in the first district of Jiang County, led eleven elementary school students outside the school to dismantle bricks from an old wall to be used for repairing the school building. Before dismantling the wall bricks, Xu Zhenzhi did not check whether the foundation of the wall was stable. He then led the students to start dismantling. Just after dismantling four bricks, he discovered that the top of the wall was slipping soil. The elementary school students ran away quickly when they heard the sound, but it was too late. This wall, more than two zhang high, fell towards the students, killing one child on the spot, seriously injuring four, and slightly injuring three. I believe that this happened due to the teacher's negligence and lack of a high sense of responsibility towards the students. It is hoped that the educational leading authorities in various regions will strengthen education in this area to prevent the occurrence of similar incidents.

### 领导小学生作课余活动必须注意安全

专栏：读者来信摘要

    领导小学生作课余活动必须注意安全
    编者按：读者康子义、梁国藩等来信，反映太原市郊区狄村中心小学和山西绛县一区陈村小学叫学生作课余劳动，因忽视安全而发生了严重的伤亡事故。这是惨痛的教训，应该引起各地小学教育工作者的普遍重视。
    （一）
    太原市郊区狄村康子义、王照等来信：四月十五日下午，狄村中心小学校长李毓伦叫教员杨桂林、陶兰生在课外活动时间带领全校百余名学生去本村堡?窑搬烧土。堡?窑崖头有二丈多高，形势非常危险，平时老乡们都不敢去挖土。当时村民黄玺曾劝阻他们；但杨桂林、陶兰生置之不理。后来又有一个名叫王拉柱的农民告诉他们说：“崖头上已经有一尺多长的裂缝，你们千万别挖啦！”杨桂林等仍然不听，继续带着学生挖土。结果挖了不到十分钟，轰然一声，大块的崖土倒下来了。这时，尘土漫天，小学生哭闹一团，待尘土消散后，只发现有两个学生被土掩埋了半截身体。他们抢救出这两个学生，就带着队回校了。当返校后清查人数时才发现少了两个学生。后来虽然在土里挖出来了，但已经无法抢救。
    这件事发生后，全村群众非常不满，死者家长更是悲痛万分。村中虽曾召开了两次大会，让大伙儿提意见，但至今已经一个多月还没有处理。建议太原市人民政府应迅速派人调查并作适当的处理。
    （二）
    山西绛县一区梁国藩来信：绛县一区陈村小学教员许珍之在五月二十一日下午课后，带领了十一个小学生去校外拆旧墙的砖头作修建校舍用。拆墙砖前许珍之没有检查墙根是否稳固，就领导学生动手去拆，刚拆得四块砖时，即发现墙顶溜土，小学生们闻声急跑，但已经来不及了，这一堵二丈多高的墙就向着学生倒下，当场砸死儿童一人，四人受重伤、三人轻伤。我认为这是由于教员麻痹大意和对学生缺乏高度责任感而发生的。希望各地教育领导机关加强这一方面的教育，以防止类似事件的发生。
