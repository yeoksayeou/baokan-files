Xinhua News Agency, New York, June 16th: According to TASS, the New York State Council of the US Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) has issued a statement sharply criticizing the policies of the United States government.

The statement said that never in American history has there been such a thorough and unconditional transfer of public institutions to large corporations and financial groups as there is now... A large number of responsible personnel from companies doing business with the government have been appointed as heads of government agencies, which are their biggest customers.

High-level positions and agencies whose duties should have been to improve the welfare of the people are now being handed over to people who were formerly notorious for their extreme hostility to the plans that these positions and institutions should have implemented.

The Council said that the promises widely publicized during the election campaign are now being blatantly undermined, and the government is pursuing a policy that only benefits monopoly capital and trusts. The government has handed over the rights to develop the seabed oil along the US coast, worth between $50 billion and $400 billion to the nation. To achieve this goal, monopoly capital has spared no expense in years of behind-the-scenes activities. In this struggle, the interests of the large oil companies are diametrically opposed to the interests of the American people. The result of the struggle is that the oil companies have prevailed... The government also announced its intention to sell the synthetic rubber factories, built at a cost of $500 million to American taxpayers, to private companies for only 15 percent of their actual value.

The Council said that the authorities have also failed to deliver on their promise to relax the Taft-Hartley anti-labor law; on the contrary, the government has indicated its support for amendments to this law. This would allow the national authorities to take even harsher measures against picket lines and organized worker activities than those stipulated by the Taft-Hartley Act.

    美国“产联”纽约州理事会发表声明
    抨击美国政府彻底为大资本家服务的政策
    【新华社十七日讯】据塔斯社纽约十六日讯：美国产业工会联合会纽约州理事会发表了一篇声明，猛烈抨击美国政府的政策。
    声明说，在美国历史上，从来没有过像现在这样彻底而无条件地把公家机关交给大康采恩与金融集团的情形……与政府做生意的各公司的大量负责人员，都被任命为政府机关的首脑，而这些政府机关正是他们最大的顾客。
    其职责本来应该是改善人民福利的高级职位和机关，现在都交给了那些过去因极端敌视这些职位和机构所应当实现的计划而出名的人了。
    理事会说，竞选期间广泛宣传的诺言现在被横加破坏，政府正在奉行着一个只符合于垄断资本和托辣斯的利益的政策。政府已交出了国家开发沿美国海岸价值达五百亿到四千亿美元的海底石油的权利。垄断资本为了达到这个目的，不惜破费巨资进行了多年的幕后活动。在这个斗争中，大石油公司的利益是与美国人民的利益背道而驰的。斗争的结果是石油公司占了上风……政府还宣布打算把耗费美国纳税人五亿美元建立的人造橡胶工厂，以只及实际价值百分之十五的价格出售给私人公司。
    理事会说，当局也没有实践放松塔夫脱—哈特莱反劳工法的诺言；相反的，政府还表明它支持对这一法律的修正案。这样一来，就会使国家当局能够对罢工纠察线和工人有组织的活动采取比塔夫脱—哈特莱法所规定的更严厉的措施。
