Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing: Jiangning County, Jiangsu Province, a typical pilot area for grassroots elections, implements the policy of combining universal suffrage with production, starting with production to ensure the smooth progress of universal suffrage work.

The universal suffrage work in Hebei Township began before the summer harvest and planting. At that time, farmers were working intensively on preparing for the summer harvest and planting, and many mutual aid teams had not yet settled their work points. The masses were uneasy due to the prolonged drought and urgently demanded solutions to production difficulties. The township election committee then decided to start the universal suffrage work with production.

There are 86 mutual aid teams in Hebei Township, and the organized farmers account for more than 80 percent of the township's households. The township election committee focused on working through the mutual aid teams while also including individual farmers. When publicizing the significance of universal suffrage, all mutual aid teams generally conducted education on the comparison between the old and new regimes and the prospects of cooperation and collectivization, which improved the masses' level of awareness, consolidated and improved the mutual aid teams, and promoted production. Yang Shengshun's mutual aid team in Suncun had not yet settled its work points, the principle of equal value exchange was not being followed, and nominally it was a mutual aid team, but in reality, everyone was doing their own thing. After education, they studied and stipulated wage rates, formulated methods for equal value exchange, and established a democratic management system. Currently, 43 teams in the township have settled their work points, and some mutual aid teams have also supplemented their summer harvest and planting plans. In response to the masses' urgent need to solve water problems due to the prolonged drought, the township election committee first called on the masses to use water economically during the publicity, and at the same time organized the township pond and dam management committee, and each village established 13 pond and dam management groups. They led the masses in drought resistance work. The work teams used these facts to further publicize the people's government's responsible and caring attitude towards the masses' production. Farmers recalled from their actual experience that the reactionary government not only did not care about the people's production but also sabotaged production, deeply realized the nature of the people's regime, further established the idea of being masters of their own affairs, and increased their enthusiasm for participating in universal suffrage.

When publicizing universal suffrage, Hebei Township, in order to take care of the masses' production time, organized propagandists and active elements to conduct publicity in ways such as "delivering to the door" and "delivering to the field." In this way, more than 80 percent of the 1,729 voters in the township received universal suffrage education and understood the principles of universal suffrage. When handling population surveys and voter registration, because the masses were educated and the work teams were able to carry out the work in an organized and planned way during the breaks before and after meals, the voter registration work in each electoral district of the township was generally completed in one and a half to two hours at a time, and in many electoral districts, 100 percent of the voters arrived at the station to register.

    贯彻普选和生产相结合的方针
    江宁县河北乡从生产入手进行普选工作
    【新华社南京讯】江苏省进行基层选举典型试办的江宁县河北乡贯彻普选和生产相结合的方针，先从生产入手，使普选工作顺利展开。
    河北乡的普选工作在夏收夏种前开始，当时农民正紧张地进行夏收和夏种的准备工作，不少互助组尚未清工结账。群众因久旱不雨，思想不安，迫切要求解决生产上的困难问题。乡选举委员会便决定普选工作先从生产入手。
    河北乡全乡有八十六个互助组，组织起来的农户占全乡农户的百分之八十以上，乡选举委员会就着重通过互助组，同时吸收单干户来进行工作。在宣传普选意义时，各互助组普遍进行了新旧政权对比和合作化、集体化前途的教育，提高了群众觉悟水平，使互助组得到了巩固和提高并对生产起了推动作用。四村杨声顺互助组清工结账尚未进行，等价交换不合理，名义上是互助组，实质上是各干各的。经过教育后，研究规定了工资价格，订出了等价交换的办法，并建立了民主管理制度。目前全乡已进行清工结账的有四十三个组，有的互助组还补订出夏收和夏种计划。针对着群众因久旱不雨，迫切要求解决用水问题的情况，乡选举委员会在宣传时首先就号召群众经济用水，同时组织了乡塘坝管理委员会，各村又成立了十三个塘坝管理小组。领导群众进行抗旱工作。工作组用这些事实，进一步宣传了人民政府对群众生产的负责和关心的态度。农民们从实际体验中回忆起反动政府不仅不关心人民生产还破坏生产的事实，深刻地认识到人民政权的性质，进一步树立了当家作主思想，提高了参加普选的积极性。
    河北乡在宣传普选时，为照顾群众生产时间，组织宣传员和群众积极分子，以“送上门”、“送上地”等方式进行宣传。这样就使全乡一千七百二十九个选民中，有百分之八十以上受到了普选的教育，懂得了普选的道理。在办理人口调查、选民登记时，因为群众受到了教育，加上工作组能够利用饭前饭后空隙时间有组织有计划地进行，全乡各选区的选民登记工作一般都在一小时半到二小时内一次完成，很多选区选民百分之百地到站登记。
