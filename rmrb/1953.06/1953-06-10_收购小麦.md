    Purchasing Wheat
    The wheat harvest has begun in China's wheat-producing areas, and large quantities of new wheat are entering the market successively. In order to accommodate farmers selling wheat, meet the needs of cities and industrial areas, and consolidate the already stable prices, grain departments and supply and marketing cooperatives in various regions should actively and promptly carry out the work of purchasing wheat.
    Due to the commencement of the country's new economic construction, the continuous increase in the population of industrial and mining areas and cities, and the continuous improvement of people's living standards, the demand for grain is increasing day by day. However, due to the scattered management and backward production technology of China's small-scale farming economy, the increase in grain production is limited. In recent years, although the amount of grain, especially wheat, sold by farmers has increased, its speed is far from keeping up with the actual demand. This imbalance between supply and demand cannot be completely changed in the next few years. This year, major wheat-producing provinces such as Anhui, Jiangsu, Henan, Shandong, and Shanxi have suffered from cold currents, late frost, pests, hail, and other disasters, resulting in reduced wheat yields. On the other hand, the national wheat planting area this year has increased by more than 47 million mu compared with last year; many lightly affected and unaffected wheat fields have yielded more than last year; many affected wheat seedlings, after being rescued, can still yield no less than last year; and the wheat in the Yangtze River Basin and southern provinces has mostly had bumper harvests. This year, the state has also reduced the total collection of wheat compared to last year in order to reduce and exempt agricultural taxes in disaster areas. This makes it even more necessary to regulate the supply and demand of wheat through planned wheat purchasing work. Grain departments and supply and marketing cooperatives in various regions must correctly grasp price policies, learn from past experiences and lessons in grain purchasing, give full play to the strength of purchasing institutions, actively improve wheat purchasing methods, and supply farmers who sell wheat with the means of production and daily necessities they need, to do a good job in wheat purchasing.
    In order to encourage farmers to increase grain production and sell surplus grain, grain prices were raised to some extent this spring, and the prices of certain industrial products were lowered. The purchase price of wheat this year is also appropriately higher than the same period last year, and the seasonal price difference of wheat has been appropriately reduced, but the purchase price of new wheat is slightly lower than the price of wheat before the new wheat was launched on the market. This measure is absolutely necessary. Grain prices or wheat prices must be adapted to other price levels and the general price index, and a proper and reasonable price difference must be maintained. In the purchase of wheat, the policy of "grading and pricing" and "superior grain at a superior price" must be implemented. Grain departments and supply and marketing cooperatives in various regions should announce purchase prices according to the wheat quality price differences stipulated by the Central Grain Ministry, and strictly prohibit the egregious behavior of downgrading and underweighing. State-owned grain departments and supply and marketing cooperatives should accept all wheat, both good and bad, grade it, price it, and store it separately in order to control more wheat and meet the needs of the country and the people. Private merchants should be allowed to purchase wheat within the state's unified plan, according to a certain proportion of the amount of wheat on the market, but all illegal activities that disrupt the market and engage in speculation should be prohibited.
    According to past experience, it is very necessary to set up wheat purchasing stations in various places to facilitate farmers' sale of wheat. However, state-owned grain departments and supply and marketing cooperatives should have an appropriate division of labor. State-owned grain departments should focus on the purchasing work in the wheat distribution markets of large and medium-sized cities and major county towns, while supply and marketing cooperatives should focus on the purchasing work in small county towns and primary markets below the county level. In wheat markets where both state-owned grain departments and cooperatives have purchasing institutions, or where neither have them, the market can be divided for purchasing under the unified plan of the economic and financial committees at the same level. In areas where the purchasing power of cooperatives is weak, state-owned grain departments may also organize forces to set up stations for purchasing after being approved by the economic and financial committees at the same level. In major wheat-producing areas, the provincial and county-level organizations of grain departments and cooperatives should establish joint offices under the unified leadership of the economic and financial committees in order to maintain close contact and strengthen leadership over wheat purchasing work. Unreasonable phenomena in past grain purchases, such as waiting too long to weigh, waiting too long to issue receipts, waiting too long to withdraw money, and purchasing stations being too far away, which made farmers spend a day and a half selling grain and caused great inconvenience to farmers, must be overcome. Every wheat purchasing station should improve its internal organization, improve work efficiency, simplify purchasing procedures, and not waste farmers' time and labor. Some purchasing stations have implemented parallel assembly line operations for weighing, issuing receipts, and paying, which should be promoted. In the past, some areas mobilized wheat-selling farmers to sell collectively by village in a planned and organized manner, which was very beneficial to improving the efficiency of purchasing work and saving time and effort for farmers and purchasing stations. This method should still be promoted under leadership and with the voluntary participation of farmers. However, the phenomenon of coercion and formalism in collective wheat sales in some areas in the past should be prevented.
    Now, grain departments and supply and marketing cooperatives in various regions should act quickly to vigorously purchase wheat, and be ready to transfer it to each other at any time according to the needs of the whole country to compensate for the shortage of commercial wheat caused by the reduced wheat production in some areas this year. At the same time, commercial departments and cooperatives in various regions should also strive to supply farmers with the means of production and daily necessities they need after selling wheat. First of all, they should investigate and understand the consumption habits of farmers in various major wheat-producing areas for other grain varieties, and transfer coarse grains or rice according to needs and possibilities. Secondly, in order to ensure the bumper harvest of autumn crops, many farmers need a large amount of commercial fertilizer and small farm implements after selling wheat, as well as general merchandise. State-owned commercial and cooperative enterprises should pay attention to investigating and understanding the specific commodity varieties, specifications, and quality needed by farmers in various places after selling wheat, pay attention to uniting private merchants, and do a good job in supplying fertilizers, small farm implements, general merchandise, or other means of production and daily necessities. Doing these things well will ensure the smooth completion of the wheat purchasing work.

### 收购小麦

    收购小麦
    我国各产麦区的小麦已经开始收割，大批新麦正在陆续上市。为了适应农民出售小麦，供应城市和工业区的需要，并巩固业已稳定的物价起见，各地粮食部门和供销合作社应该积极地及时地开展收购小麦的工作。
    由于国家新的经济建设的开始，工矿区和城市人口的不断增加，人民生活水平的不断提高，因而粮食的需要量也日益增大。但是，由于我国小农经济经营的分散和生产技术的落后，粮食的增产受到限制；几年来，农民出卖粮食、特别是出卖小麦的数量虽有增加，但它的速度，还远远赶不上实际的需要量，这种供求关系的不平衡现象，是今后数年内也还不能完全改变的。今年又因为我国安徽、江苏、河南、山东、山西等主要产麦省份，遭受寒流或晚霜、虫、雹等灾害，致小麦产量减少。另一方面，由于本年全国小麦种植面积比上年扩大了四千七百多万亩；许多轻灾和未受灾的麦田还比去年增产；许多受灾的麦苗经过抢救以后，产量仍可不低于去年；而长江流域和南方各省的小麦则大部丰收；今年国家为了减免灾区的农业税，对小麦的总征收量也比去年减少了。这就更加需要通过有计划的收购小麦的工作，来调节小麦的供求情况。各地粮食部门和供销合作社必须正确地掌握价格政策，接受过去收购粮食的经验教训，充分发挥收购机构的力量，积极改进收购小麦的方法，供应出售小麦的农民以他们所需要的生产资料和生活资料，做好收购小麦的工作。
    为了鼓励农民增产粮食和出售余粮，粮价在今年春天已经有所提高了，若干工业品的价格则有所降低。而今年小麦的收购价格，比去年同期又有了适当的提高，小麦的季节差价适当地缩小了，但新麦的收购价比新麦上市前的麦价则略低。这种措施是完全必要的。粮价或麦价必须与其它物价水平和物价的总指数相适应，而保持正当的合理的差价。在收购小麦中，必须贯彻“分等论价”和“优粮优价”的政策。各地粮食部门和供销合作社，应按中央粮食部规定的小麦品质差价，公布收购价格，严格禁止压级压秤的恶劣行为。国营粮食部门和供销合作社对于小麦应该好次都收，分级计价，分级保存，以便掌握更多的小麦，供应国家和人民的需要。对于私商收购小麦，在国家统一的计划内，按小麦上市量的一定比重，是应该被允许的，但对于一切扰乱市场和投机取巧的非法行为，应一律加以禁止。
    根据过去的经验，各地设置小麦收购站，以便利农民出售小麦是很必要的。但国营粮食部门和供销合作社应该有适当的分工。国营粮食部门应以掌握大中城市和主要的县城的小麦集散市场的收购工作为主，供销合作社则应以小县城及县以下的初级市场的收购工作为主。在国营粮食部门和合作社双方都有或双方都没有收购机构的小麦市场，可在同级财经委员会的统一计划下，划分市场进行收购。在合作社收购力量薄弱的地区，经同级财经委员会批准后，国营粮食部门也可组织力量去设站收购。在主要产麦区，粮食部门和合作社的省、县两级组织应在财经委员会的统一领导下设立联合办公室，以便密切联系并加强对小麦收购工作的领导。过去收购粮食中的不合理现象，如过秤要等很久，开条要等很久，取钱也要等很久，收购站距离太远，卖一次粮要花费一天半的时间，使农民感到极大不便的现象必须克服。每一个小麦收购站都应该改进内部组织，提高工作效率，简化收购手续，不浪费农民的时间和劳力。有些收购站实行过秤、开条、付款的平行流水作业法，是应该加以推广的。过去有些地区曾经动员售麦农民以村为单位，有计划有组织地集体出售，这对提高收购工作的效率，节省农民和收购站的时间和力量都是很有好处的，这种办法在有领导和农民自愿的条件下仍然是应该推行的。但过去若干地区在集体售麦时有强迫命令和形式主义的现象，这就应该加以防止。
    现在，各地粮食部门和供销合作社应该迅速行动起来，大力收购小麦，并按全国的需要情况，随时准备互相调拨，以弥补部分地区因今年小麦减产所引起的商品小麦不足的缺陷。同时，各地商业部门和合作社还应该努力供应农民在出售小麦后对于生产资料和生活资料的需要，首先应该调查和了解各个主要产麦区的农民对其他粮食品种的消费习惯，根据需要和可能调进杂粮或大米。其次，许多农民为了保证大秋作物的丰收，他们在出售小麦后需要大量的商品肥料和小件农具，也还需要百货，国营商业和合作社应该注意调查和了解各地农民在售麦后，具体需要的商品品种、规格和质量，注意团结私商，作好肥料、小件农具、百货或其他生产资料和生活资料的供应工作。做好这些工作就能保证小麦收购工作的顺利完成。
