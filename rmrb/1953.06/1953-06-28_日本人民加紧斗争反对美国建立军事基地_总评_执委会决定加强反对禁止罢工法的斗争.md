Xinhua News Agency, June 27th dispatch: Tokyo news: The Japanese people's movement against the United States establishing military bases is constantly developing.

    The struggle of the people of Aomori Prefecture against turning the area around Mount Iwaki within the prefecture into a U.S. military training ground is expanding. Since the U.S.-Japan Joint Committee decided in April to forcibly occupy 4,800 cho (approximately 15 mu per cho) of land in the Mount Iwaki area as a U.S. military training ground, the people of the thirteen cities, towns, and villages in the Mount Iwaki area immediately launched a fierce opposition movement. The mayors, town heads, and village heads of these places also participated in this movement. Many villages in the prefecture have formed alliances against the U.S. forcibly occupying Mount Iwaki as a training ground. The principals of the new secondary schools in Nishitsugaru County, Aomori Prefecture, held a meeting and decided to launch a movement to "oppose turning the homeland into a second Misawa (a large U.S. military base in Aomori Prefecture)." Under pressure from the people of the prefecture, the Aomori Prefectural Government had to refuse the on-site investigation by U.S. military officers sent by the U.S.-Japan Joint Committee. The Vice-Governor of Aomori Prefecture also went to Tokyo to petition the Yoshida government to oppose the U.S. military taking over Mount Iwaki.

    In Hokkaido, fishermen in Oshima Village, Hakodate City, are continuing their struggle against the U.S. military establishing a naval gun firing range. They have launched a signature campaign against the establishment of the firing range and have repeatedly petitioned the local government. The fishermen's struggle has received the support of the working class. The Hakodate Trade Union Conference has sent an investigation team to Oshima Village to carry out an investigation to develop the movement against the U.S. military establishing a naval gun firing range. Now, the movement against the U.S. military establishing a naval gun firing range in Oshima is expanding to the entire city of Hakodate.

    At the same time, the struggle of the people of Nagano Prefecture against the U.S. military using Mount Asama as a training ground is also continuing. The towns of Karuizawa and Komoro at the foot of Mount Asama recently held town meetings for several consecutive days to oppose the U.S. military establishing a training ground in their hometown. The Alliance Against the U.S. Military Establishing a Training Ground in Mount Asama and trade union organizations in Nagano Prefecture are promoting the movement against the U.S. military establishing a training ground by collecting signatures and other means.

Xinhua News Agency, June 25th dispatch: Tokyo news: A recent large-scale war exercise by Japan's disguised army, the "Security Force," has aroused the unease of the Japanese people.

    The "Security Force" exercise was held at the U.S. military training ground at the foot of Mount Fuji under the instructions of the U.S. military authorities. The exercise lasted for three days, starting on the 18th. Participating in the exercise were 7,500 fully staffed "Security Force" combat troops, equipped with aircraft, heavy artillery, and more than 120 tanks and armored vehicles. This was the largest joint land-air exercise by the "Security Force" since its establishment.

    The situation of the "Security Force" equipped with American weapons once again proves that the "Security Force" is indeed an embryo of a new Japanese army fostered as a U.S. mercenary army. Shortly after the end of the exercise, Atsutaro Kimura, Director-General of the "Security Agency," even openly stated on the 23rd in response to questions at the Budget Committee of the House of Representatives that the "Security Force" will not only be used to "maintain domestic peace and order" but will also participate in "foreign operations."

    The Japanese people, who saw the "Security Force" participating in the exercise departing from Tokyo to the training ground, further recognized the true face of the "Security Force." According to a Kyodo News report, when the "Security Force" departed, people along the way said in unison: "No matter how you look at it, it's an army." A housewife, thinking of the "Five-Year Defense Plan" revealed by Atsutaro Kimura, said with apprehension: "Will my fourteen-year-old only son be conscripted into the army when he grows up?" A twenty-year-old worker said: "Although the government says this is not rearmament, judging from this situation, it is completely an army. I am still young, and the thought of conscription makes me shudder."

Xinhua News Agency, June 27th dispatch: Tokyo news: Following the general mobilization rallies held on the 20th by the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (referred to as "Sohyo") in various parts of Japan against the Yoshida government's anti-strike law, the "Sohyo" Executive Committee held a meeting in Tokyo on the 24th and decided to strengthen the struggle against the anti-strike law.

    The "Sohyo" Executive Committee decided to take the Japan Electrical Industry Workers' Union, the Japan Coal Miners' Union, and the Japan Private Railway Workers' Union Confederation, which have already made preparations for strikes, as the center, and further strengthen contact with other trade union organizations to launch a large-scale struggle against the anti-strike law between the end of June and the beginning of July.

    At the same time, the Executive Committee decided to vigorously carry out propaganda work to further expose to the Japanese working class and the broad masses of the people the Yoshida government's aim of using the anti-strike law to deprive workers of their basic rights and revive militarism.

    日本人民加紧斗争反对美国建立军事基地
    “总评”执委会决定加强反对禁止罢工法的斗争
    【新华社二十七日讯】东京消息：日本人民反对美国建立军事基地的运动正在不断发展。
    青森县人民反对把县境里的岩木山一带作为美军演习场的斗争日益扩大。自从四月间美日联合委员会决定要强占岩木山一带的四千八百町步（每町步约合十五市亩）土地作为美军演习场以后，岩木山一带的十三个市、镇和村的人民，立刻展开了激烈的反对运动。这些地方的市长、镇长和村长也都参加了这个运动。县内许多村落都成立了反对美国强占岩木山为演习场的同盟。青森县西津轻郡的各新制中学校长曾举行会议，决定要展开“反对把乡土变成第二个三泽（美国在青森县的一个大军事基地）”的运动。青森县政府在全县人民的压力下，不得不拒绝美日联合委员会派来的美军军官进行实地调查，青森县副县长也到东京向吉田政府请愿，反对美军接收岩木山。
    在北海道，函馆市大岛村的渔民为反对美军设立炮舰打靶场，正在继续进行斗争。他们发起了反对设立打靶场的签名运动，并多次向当地地方政府请愿。渔民的斗争得到了工人阶级的支持，函馆工会会议为开展反对美军打靶场运动，已派出调查团到大岛村进行调查。现在，反对美军在大岛设立炮舰打靶场的运动，正在向全函馆市扩展中。
    同时，长野县人民反对美军要以浅间山为演习场的斗争也在继续展开。浅间山麓的轻井泽町和小诸町不久以前曾连日举行町民大会，反对美军在他们家乡设立演习场。反对美军在浅间山设立演习场同盟会和长野县的工会组织，都在用征集签名和其他的方式推进反对美军设立演习场的运动。
    【新华社二十五日讯】东京消息：日本的变相陆军——“保安队”最近举行的一次大规模战争演习，引起日本人民的不安。
    “保安队”的演习是在美军当局的指示下在富士山脚美军演习场举行的。演习从十八日起举行了三天。参加这次演习的有编制完整的“保安队”战斗部队七千五百人，配备着飞机、重炮和一百二十多辆坦克、装甲车等。这是“保安队”自成立以来规模最大的一次陆空联合演习。
    装备着美国武器的“保安队”演习的情况，再一次证明了“保安队”正是一支被作为美国雇佣军队而扶植起来的日本新陆军的胚胎。在演习结束后不久，“保安厅”长官木村笃太郎于二十三日在众议院预算委员会回答质问时，甚至公开表示，“保安队”不仅将用于“维持国内和平与秩序”，并且也将参加“对外作战”。
    看到参加演习的“保安队”从东京开拔到演习场的情况的日本人民，进一步认清了“保安队”的真面目。据共同社的消息透露，在“保安队”开拔时，沿途的人都异口同声地说：“怎么看，也是军队。”一位家庭主妇联想到木村笃太郎透露的“五年防卫计划”，惶恐不安地说：“我家十四岁的独生子长大了，也要被征去当兵吗？”一个二十岁的工人说：“政府虽然说这不是重整军备，但照这种情况来看，却完全是军队。我的年纪还轻，想到征兵，令人不寒而栗。” 【新华社二十七日讯】东京消息：日本工会总评议会（简称“总评”）继二十日在日本各地举行了反对吉田政府禁止罢工法的总奋起大会之后，于二十四日在东京举行了“总评”执行委员会会议，决定加强反对禁止罢工法的斗争。
    “总评”执行委员会决定以已经作好罢工准备的日本电气产业工会、日本煤矿工会和日本私营铁道工会总联合会等工会为中心，进一步和其他工会组织加强联系，在六月底到七月初之间发动一个大规模的反对禁止罢工法的斗争。
    执行委员会同时决定要大力展开宣传工作，进一步向日本工人阶级和广大人民揭穿吉田政府以禁止罢工法来剥夺工人基本权利和复活军国主义的目的。
