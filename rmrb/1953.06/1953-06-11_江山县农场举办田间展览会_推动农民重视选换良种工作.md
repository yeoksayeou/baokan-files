    Jiangshan County Farm Holds Field Exhibition to Promote Farmers' Emphasis on Selecting and Replacing Good Seeds
    Letter from Wu Jihe, Shangyu District, Jiangshan County, Zhejiang Province: Jiangshan County Farm in Zhejiang Province held a wheat field exhibition on May 13th, conducting field evaluations. Thirteen mutual aid team leaders, technicians, and experienced farmers from Daxi Tan Township, Shangyu District, were invited to participate. They visited the farm's trial plantings of "Zhe Nong No. 17," "Jinhua White Pufmai Wheat," "Hong Zhiliao," "Zhe Nong No. 9," and the local variety "Hong Xu Tieding" wheat from Li Shuixiu, the mutual aid team leader from Sicun. Comrades from the farm and mutual aid team leader Li Shuixiu went to the fields to explain in detail the characteristics and cultivation methods of the wheat varieties.
    Through this wheat field exhibition, after the representatives of each village returned to their villages, they convened meetings of mutual aid team members and mass meetings to publicize the benefits of selecting good wheat seeds, promoting everyone's emphasis on seed selection. For example, in Sicun, Daxi Tan Township, four mutual aid teams formulated plans, deciding to mobilize thirty-eight women to select 630 jin of "Hong Xu Tieding Wheat" by ear and preparing to exchange it with the farm for 118 jin of "Jinhua White Pufmai Wheat." Twenty-nine women in Wucun were also mobilized to participate in wheat seed selection work. I believe that Jiangshan County Farm's practice of educating farmers with examples, promoting seed selection work, and popularizing superior varieties is worthy of emulation by farms in other regions.

### 江山县农场举办田间展览会  推动农民重视选换良种工作

    江山县农场举办田间展览会
    推动农民重视选换良种工作
    浙江省江山县上余区吴佶和来信：浙江省江山县农场在五月十三日举行了一次小麦田间展览会，进行田间评比，被邀请参加的有上余区大溪滩乡十三位互助组长、技术员和老农。他们参观了农场试种的“浙农十七号”“金华白蒲麦”“红知了”“浙农九号”和四村互助组长李水修的本地种“红须铁钉”小麦。农场同志和互助组长李水修亲往田间详细介绍小麦品种特点和栽培方法。
    通过这次小麦田间展览，各村代表们回村后，都分别召开了互助组员会和群众会，向大家宣传做好小麦选种的好处，推动了大家重视选种工作。如大溪滩乡四村就有四个互助组订出计划，决定发动三十八个妇女穗选“红须铁钉麦”六百三十斤，并准备向农场换“金华白蒲麦”一百十八斤。五村也发动了二十九个妇女参加小麦选种工作。我认为江山县农场以实例教育农民，推动选种工作并推广优良品种的作法是值得各地农场效法的。
