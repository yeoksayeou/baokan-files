Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 16th: The Korean-Chinese delegation to the Korean armistice talks issued the following communiqué on June 16th:

    Staff from both sides continued to hold administrative meetings on June 16th.
    Liaison officers from both sides also held a meeting in the afternoon.
    Both sides have scheduled a delegation plenary meeting for the 17th.

Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 16th: Our special correspondent Wu Min reports: The plenary meeting of the delegations from both sides of the Korean armistice talks will reconvene at 11:00 a.m. on the 17th, after a six-day recess. At the same time, staff and liaison officers are finalizing the last administrative details for the signing of the armistice agreement. The resumption of the delegation plenary meeting on the 17th indicates new developments in this preparatory work.

    These developments have come about as a result of the increasing number and length of meetings held in Panmunjom, which remain secret. The number and length of meetings of staff carrying maps and assistants are particularly numerous. On the 15th, staff assistants were seen constantly entering and leaving the meeting place with maps until 7:00 p.m. In the afternoon of the 16th, staff assistants entered the meeting place with glass-covered "shadow boxes"; the "shadow boxes" were equipped with light bulbs for drawing lines on the maps. They worked until the evening. All these signs indicate that the work of redrawing the military demarcation line is progressing rapidly and that a complete agreement is about to be reached.

    朝鲜谈判双方参谋人员继续开行政性会议
    迹象表明重新划定军事分界线的工作进展很快
    【新华社开城十六日电】朝鲜停战谈判朝中代表团六月十六日发表公报如下：
    六月十六日双方参谋人员继续举行行政性会议。
    双方联络官亦于下午举行会议。
    双方并订于十七日举行代表团大会。
    【新华社开城十六日电】本社特派记者吴敏报道：朝鲜停战谈判双方代表团大会在休会六天后，将在十七日上午十一时复会，同时参谋人员和联络官正在完成签订停战协定的最后行政细节。十七日代表团大会的复会表明这项准备工作已有了新的发展。
    这种发展是随着在板门店举行的次数和时间不断增多的会议而来的，这些会议仍然是秘密进行的。携带地图和助理人员的参谋人员的会议的次数和时间都特别多。在十五日，人们看到参谋助理人员不断带着地图进出于会场，一直到下午七点钟。十六日下午，参谋助理人员带着有玻璃盖的“影箱”进入会场；“影箱”上装有电灯泡，是供在地图上画线之用的。他们一直工作到晚上。这一切迹象都表明重新划定军事分界线的工作有了迅速进展，快要达成完全协议。
