Xinhua News Agency, June 8th: According to TASS, Moscow, "Pravda" observer Yefimov, commenting on the recent visit to the United States by Jean Monnet, Chairman of the High Authority of the European Coal and Steel "Community" group, said: The Chairman of the High Authority of the European Coal and Steel "Community" group went at the invitation of the United States government, which is anxious about the situation of this group.

	Among the dozen or so various "European Group" plans, the European Coal and Steel "Community" is the only one that has taken rough shape. The treaty has been concluded, a high-level "supranational" institution has been established, an agreement has been reached on opening a common market for coal and steel, and estimates have been made of the resources and production capacity of each member state. However, when implementing the plans and agreements, it was immediately discovered that these plans and agreements were either unworkable or, if implemented, would deepen the contradictions between the monopoly groups.

	French monopoly capital pressured the government to reduce export taxes on steel products, so that French steel manufacturers could compete more easily in the world market. To counter this situation, West German monopoly capital exerted pressure on the West German parliament, forcing it to immediately pass the Adenauer government's decision to increase the special tax on imported steel from 6% to 12%. On the "common steel market," tariff barriers have been formally abolished, but in reality, the tariff war between the members of the European Coal and Steel Community has intensified.

	The situation in the "common coal market" is no better. The Dutch newspaper "Het Vaderland" said: The European Coal and Steel Community court has received three accusations against the High Authority. Two accusations came from Germans, who protested the abolition of special prices for German coal used for shipping; the third accusation came from the French, who opposed subsidies to Belgian mine owners. In addition, France also demanded that Belgium not be allowed to transport its coal to the French market with the help of subsidies. This is the real situation of the "European Group."

	American monopoly capital originally intended to merge and control Western European industrial resources within the coal and steel "Community," but this effort is encountering increasing obstacles. Britain's refusal to join the group and the dominant position occupied by West German monopoly capital have deepened the divisions between countries.

	These divisions threaten to erupt from within the "Community," which Washington intends to use as the economic foundation for the aggressive "European Defense Community." Monnet's summons to Washington is obviously related to the attempt to prevent this plan from falling through.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, May 5th: "Pravda" published a dispatch from P. Degot in Paris, entitled "The Economic Situation in Western Europe."

	Degot wrote: In the East, that is, in the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries, production is constantly increasing, and the speed of production is steadily increasing, exceeding the highest speed ever achieved by capitalist countries. At the same time, great achievements have been made in planned production and expanded trade. In the West, the situation is just the opposite. Destructive military programs are causing stagnation and reduced production in civilian industries.

	Now, the contradictions between Western European countries are more severe than ever before. Competition in Western European markets and in colonial and dependent country markets has led to fierce struggles between French, British, and West German companies. As the economic crisis looms, this competition is becoming increasingly acute.

	West German companies receive large amounts of dollar subsidies. According to recent figures, the total amount of direct American investment in West Germany has reached 675 million marks, and the total capital of West German companies controlled by the United States exceeds 1.5 billion marks.

	Analyzing the attitude of French manufacturers, Degot pointed out: Even those who are interested in war contracts are very hostile to the Bonn and Paris war treaties. French industrialists fear that after these treaties come into effect, they will no longer be able to obtain lucrative contracts and will allow West German rivals to seize the past.

	The contradictions between American monopoly capital and Western European monopoly capital have intensified in recent months. The incredibly high American tariffs have intensified these contradictions. American protectionist policies make Western European commercial groups very uneasy, because this policy keeps them out of the dollar market.

	Due to the planned refusal of the United States to allow Western European goods to enter its market, some Western European business people are increasingly urgently demanding that trade be restored with the Soviet Union, the People's Democratic countries, and People's China, regardless of American opposition.

	As the dollar continues to dominate the currencies of other Western European countries, it is even more difficult for British and French monopoly capital to compete with their American competitors. The dollar shortage puts pressure on the currencies of most Western European countries, which are also suffering from trade deficits, budget deficits, and inflation, all of which are the inevitable consequences of pursuing Washington's arms race.

	The current feature of Western Europe's economic difficulties is that economic militarization makes economic difficulties even greater and more profound. Throughout Western Europe, the result of economic militarization is increased poverty for the masses. In every country, the purchasing power of the people is lower than before the war, housing conditions are very poor, and the situation is deteriorating as the crisis matures day by day.

	The working people are increasingly aware of the real reasons for their poverty. This awareness is the basis for the broad movement to strive for the satisfaction of the economic demands of the working people, which is developing vigorously among the workers in the French automobile industry, urban transportation, shipping, railway transportation, and public institutions. This also explains the reasons for the strong strikes in France, Italy, and Belgium.

### 美国控制的欧洲煤钢“联营”内部分歧加深  西欧在美国竞争者的压力下经济日益困难

    美国控制的欧洲煤钢“联营”内部分歧加深
    西欧在美国竞争者的压力下经济日益困难
    【新华社八日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：“真理报”观察家叶菲莫夫评论欧洲煤钢“联营”集团高级机构主席让·摩纳最近访美一事说：欧洲煤钢“联营”集团高级机构主席是应美国政府邀请而去的，美国政府正因为这个集团的情况而焦虑不安。
    在十来个各式各样的“欧洲集团”计划中，欧洲煤钢“联营”是唯一已经粗具规模的集团。条约缔结了，一个高级的“超国家”机构建立了，关于开放煤钢共同市场一事已经达成了协议，对各成员国的资源和生产能力也作了估计。但是，在执行计划和协议的时候，立刻就发现：这些计划和协议或者是行不通的，或者是一旦实现就会加深各垄断集团之间的矛盾。
    法国垄断资本使政府减轻钢产品的出口税，好让法国钢铁制造商在世界市场上容易进行竞争。为了对付这种情况，西德垄断资本就对西德议会施用压力，迫使它立刻通过阿登纳政府的决定，把进口钢的特别税从百分之六提高到百分之十二。在“钢的共同市场”上，关税壁垒形式上是取消了，可是实际上欧洲煤钢联营集团各成员国之间的关税战已经更加剧烈。
    “煤的共同市场”的情况也不见得好一些。荷兰报纸“祖国报”说：欧洲煤钢联营法庭已经收到对高级机构的责难三起。两起责难来自德国人，他们抗议取消德国航运用煤的特别价格；第三起责难来自法国人，他们反对给比利时矿主以补助费。此外，法国还要求不准比利时靠补助费的帮助而把它的煤运到法国市场上去。这就是“欧洲集团”的真正情况。
    美国垄断资本原打算把西欧工业资源合并在煤钢
    “联营”内而加以控制，但是这种努力正在碰到越来越大的障碍。英国拒绝参加这个集团以及西德垄断资本占有的支配地位，加深了各国的分歧。
    这种分歧有从“联营”内部爆发的危险，而这个机构是华盛顿打算用来做侵略性的“欧洲防务集团”的经济基础的。摩纳奉召到华盛顿去，显然和要防止这个计划成为泡影的企图有关。
    【新华社八日讯】塔斯社莫斯科五日讯：“真理报”刊载了普·德固发自巴黎的一篇通讯，题为
    “西欧的经济情况”。
    德固写道：在东方，即在苏联和人民民主国家里，生产在不断增加，生产速度在稳步地提高，超过了资本主义国家所曾有过的最高速度。同时，在计划生产和扩大贸易方面都有很大的成就。在西方，情况恰好相反，破坏性的军备计划使得民用工业停滞和减产。
    现在，西欧国家彼此之间的矛盾比以前任何时候都要厉害。西欧市场中以及殖民地和附属国市场中的竞争引起了法国、英国和西德公司之间的激烈斗争。随着经济危机的日益迫近，这种竞争越来越尖锐。
    西德公司得到大量的美元补贴。根据最近的数字，美国在西德的直接投资总数已达到六亿七千五百万马克，受美国控制的西德公司的全部资本超过十五亿马克。
    德固分析法国制造商的态度时指出：即使那些对战争合同感到兴趣的人，也非常敌视波恩和巴黎战争条约。法国工业界人士担心，在这些条约生效之后，它们就再也不能得到利润丰厚的合同，而会让西德的劲敌夺取过去。
    美国垄断资本和西欧的垄断资本之间的矛盾，最近几个月以来已经加剧。美国高得惊人的关税使得这些矛盾更加激烈。美国的保护主义政策使西欧商业集团非常不安，因为这种政策把它们关在美元市场的门外。
    由于美国有计划地拒绝让西欧商品进入它的市场，有一些西欧工商界人士日益急迫地要求不顾美国的反对，而与苏联、人民民主国家及人民中国恢复贸易。
    由于美元继续左右其他西欧国家的货币，英国和法国垄断资本就更难斗得过它们的美国竞争者。美元荒使大多数西欧国家的货币受到压力，这些国家同时还遭受到贸易逆差、预算赤字和通货膨胀的困难，所有这些都是奉行华盛顿所进行的军备运动的不可避免的后果。
    目前西欧经济困难的特点是：经济军事化使得经济困难更加增加和深刻化。在整个西欧，经济军事化的结果使得群众更加贫困。无论在那一个国家，人民的购买力都比战前降低，居住情况很坏，随着危机一天天在成熟，情况日趋恶化。
    劳动人民越来越了解到他们贫穷的真正原因。这种觉悟是争取满足劳动人民经济要求的广大运动的基础，这种运动在法国汽车工业、城市交通、航运、铁路运输和公共机关的工作人员中都在蓬蓬勃勃地发展着。这也说明了法国、意大利和比利时的强有力的罢工的原因。
