How to Publicize "The State Plan is the Law"

Our newspaper has repeatedly publicized the principle that "the state plan is the law." Have all enterprise leaders and general workers deeply understood this principle and firmly established the concept of resolutely completing the state plan? The fact is not so. In our enterprises, there are still many people who lack a serious sense of responsibility for completing the state plan, which is an important reason why many units cannot complete the state plan in a balanced and comprehensive manner. Therefore, our newspaper should not only repeatedly publicize this principle theoretically, but also be good at using concrete facts to vividly illustrate it, and use its own reports to specifically answer this important question raised in real life. In this regard, the Shenyang Daily's continuous reports on "The Long-Term Failure of the Electric Engineering Plant No. 15 to Complete its Tasks Resulting in Serious Consequences," which began on May 18, is a good example.

Based on the serious situation in which many state-owned factories in Shenyang City failed to complete the state plan in the first quarter, the Shenyang Daily, after investigation and research, put forward criticisms of the Electric Engineering Plant No. 15. The plant failed to complete the state plan for nine consecutive months from August last year to April this year, thus causing serious consequences that damaged the country's economic construction. The Shenyang Daily used vivid examples to highlight these consequences. According to the newspaper's investigation, merely because the plant's main product, high-voltage switchboards (an important piece of equipment in substations), failed to be delivered on time, the progress of certain important capital construction projects and production of forty-five units, including Anshan Iron and Steel Company, Northeast Electric Power Administration, and a hydropower station in Northwest China, was seriously affected. For example, in order to expand production, the Northeast Paper Mill No. 3 built a new-style ultra-high substation, and its main equipment, high-voltage switchboards, was ordered from the Electric Engineering Plant No. 15. According to the contract, the delivery should have been made at the end of last year, but the plant delayed the delivery for more than three months, which greatly affected the paper mill's capital construction project. Another example is that in order to build the Northwest, the state built a new type of hydropower station in a certain place, and the high-voltage switchboards needed for this power station were also ordered from the Electric Engineering Plant No. 15. The power station's project was completed at the end of last year, but because the plant delayed the delivery for more than two months, the power station could not transmit electricity on time, affecting the need to supply industrial production. Furthermore, a newly built substation in western Liaoning Province also could not be completed on time due to the Electric Engineering Plant No. 15's delayed delivery, which caused three factories with thousands of workers to be unable to start work due to lack of electricity. These facts revealed by the Shenyang Daily vividly illustrate a principle, that is: in the country's planned large-scale economic construction, if any enterprise cannot accurately complete the state's tasks, it will not only be a loss to the enterprise itself, but will also inevitably hinder other enterprises and affect the progress of the entire national construction.

The Shenyang Daily not only profoundly revealed the above shortcomings, but also analyzed the root causes of these shortcomings. The Shenyang Daily pointed out that the reason why the Electric Engineering Plant No. 15 could not complete the state plan for a long time was that the plant's leading cadres treated the management of the enterprise with a bureaucratic attitude, did not study their work diligently, and rarely went deep into the grassroots to understand the production situation and problems in the work, which led to the abnormal confusion of the department work, unclear responsibilities between departments, no contact with each other, and a serious phenomenon of no one being responsible and irresponsibility; at the same time, the plan management was very weak, the original records were not a true reflection of the actual situation, and the accuracy of quota management and work plans was very poor, forming a situation of "planning is planning, and doing is doing." These many serious shortcomings in enterprise management made the plant's production long-term in an unreasonable state. The Shenyang Daily depicted a picture of the plant's chaotic production situation: sometimes slack, sometimes tight, with monthly crash programs. On the one hand, equipment was often stopped and the utilization rate was very low. For example, in February of this year, it only reached 38 percent, and at one time, the man-hours waiting for materials accounted for 28 percent of the total man-hours. On the other hand, the phenomenon of overtime work was serious. For example, at the end of last year, seeing that the annual production plan was about to fail, the Party organization mobilized Party members and activists to take the lead in working overtime, and department heads, technicians, and general staff all put down their work and went to the workshops to work with the workers, and even the courtyard and office became work sites. The lack of a sound management system in the plant's production process, and its frequent state of chaos, naturally led to its long-term failure to complete the state plan.

Because the facts revealed by the Shenyang Daily about the Electric Engineering Plant No. 15's inability to accurately complete the state plan were a problem with universality, and the contradiction pointed out by the newspaper that the plant's enterprise management work was far behind the requirements of production development was a common contradiction existing in many enterprises; therefore, once this problem was seriously raised by the newspaper, it played a relatively widespread educational role among the masses. Through the education of the newspaper, the workers of the Electric Engineering Plant No. 15 realized the significance of completing the state plan. Cong Peimin, the head of the business section, wrote to the newspaper: "In the past, we also talked about the need to establish the view that 'the state plan is the law,' but we were not clear in our minds why we must establish this view; in the past, we also talked about the need to serve large-scale economic construction, but we rarely linked it to the actual situation of our factory. After the newspaper revealed the losses our factory caused to the country this time, I understood these principles and therefore felt very ashamed." Workers from units such as the Mechanical Plant No. 2, No. 4, No. 7, and the Electric Engineering Plant No. 5, studied the Shenyang Daily's report on the Electric Engineering Plant No. 15 and conducted preliminary discussions. Jiang Yushu, the deputy section chief of the inspection section of the Electric Engineering Plant No. 5, said in the discussion: "The lessons of the Electric Engineering Plant No. 15 have made us realize that there are mutual connections between factories, between sections of a factory, and between sections and workshops, just like a clock, it won't work without a single part. Therefore, each unit must play its due role to make the entire country move towards industrialization." Zhao Hanlin, the deputy director of the Mechanical Plant No. 4, and Lu Fengyi, the deputy director of the Electric Motor Plant, also combined the shortcomings of their factories in completing the state plan and enterprise management, and made self-criticisms in the newspaper.

To struggle for the resolute completion of the state plan is a regular and important propaganda task of our newspapers during the period of national economic construction. Newspapers should be good at promptly commending those units that complete and exceed the state plan in a balanced and comprehensive manner, and promptly criticizing those units that cannot complete the state plan, while analyzing the reasons for good or bad completion, and pointing out ways to improve production. The Shenyang Daily chose the Electric Engineering Plant No. 15 as a typical example to powerfully carry out the propaganda of "resolutely completing the state plan," which is correct. However, there are still areas for improvement in the Shenyang Daily's publicity in this regard. For example, the newspaper raised this issue relatively late. Although the newspaper had revealed the fact that the Electric Engineering Plant No. 15 had failed to complete its production tasks for a long time as early as April 1, it did not attract the attention of the masses because the issue was raised in a disorganized and unhighlighted manner; it played a great role when the issue was clearly raised again on May 18. Furthermore, there is still an erroneous idea among some cadres that "capital construction is the first priority, and production is not important," and the example of the Electric Engineering Plant No. 15 is enough to powerfully criticize this idea; however, the newspaper has not yet criticized this issue in connection with this problem. Our newspapers should thoroughly criticize all kinds of ideas that neglect production and the completion of the state plan from various aspects, and should use vivid facts to sound the alarm to those who hold this idea, and educate them to establish the concept that "the state plan is the law."

### 怎样宣传“国家的计划就是法律”

专栏：报纸工作述评

    怎样宣传“国家的计划就是法律”
    我们的报纸曾经一再宣传过“国家的计划就是法律”的道理。是不是所有的企业领导者和一般职工都深刻地认识了这个道理，并牢固地树立起坚决完成国家计划的观念呢？事实并非如此。在我们的企业里，还有不少人对于完成国家计划缺乏严肃的责任感，这就是许多单位不能均衡地、全面地完成国家计划的一个重要原因。因此我们的报纸不仅应该反复地从理论上宣传这个道理，而且应该善于用具体事实来生动地阐明它，用自己的报道来具体地解答现实生活中提出的这一重要问题。在这一方面，沈阳日报从五月十八日开始对“电工十五厂长期完不成任务造成严重恶果”的连续报道，是一个较好的例子。
    沈阳日报根据沈阳市许多国营工厂第一季度没有完成国家计划的严重情况，经过调查研究，提出了对电工十五厂的批评。该厂从去年八月到今年四月一连九个月没有完成国家计划，因而造成损害国家经济建设的严重后果。沈阳日报运用鲜明的事例突出地宣传了这种后果。据该报调查，仅仅由于该厂主要产品高压开关板（是变电所中的一种重要设备）一项未能按时出厂，就严重地影响了鞍山钢铁公司、东北电业管理局、西北某水力发电站等四十五个单位的某些重要基本建设工程和生产的进行。例如东北造纸三厂为了扩大生产，修建了一座新式特高变电所，其主要设备高压开关板就是在电工十五厂订制的，按照合同规定应该在去年年底交货，但该厂拖延了三个多月才交货，因而使得造纸三厂的这项基本建设工程大受影响。又如国家为了建设西北，在某地修建了一座新型水力发电站，这个发电站所需要的高压开关板也是在电工十五厂订制的。去年年底发电站的工程已经完成，但因为该厂拖延了两个多月才交货，致使发电站不能按时送电，影响了供应工业生产的需要。再如辽西某新建变电所同样因为电工十五厂拖延交货，工程不能按时完工，以致三个拥有数千工人的工厂因缺电而不能开工。沈阳日报所揭发的这些事实生动地说明了一个道理，那就是：在国家有计划的大规模经济建设中，任何一个企业不能准确完成国家的任务，将不仅是这个企业本身的损失，而且必然会妨害其他企业和影响整个国家建设的进行。
    沈阳日报不只深刻地揭发了上述缺点，并且分析了这些缺点产生的根源。沈阳日报指出电工十五厂所以长期不能完成国家计划的原因，在于该厂领导干部以官僚主义态度对待企业的管理工作，不钻研业务，很少深入下层了解生产情况和工作中的问题，以致科室工作异常混乱，科室之间职责范围不清，互不联系，无人负责和不负责任的现象严重；同时计划管理十分薄弱，原始纪录不是实际情况的真实反映，定额管理和作业计划的准确性很差，形成“计划是计划，干是干”。企业管理方面的这许多严重缺点，使得该厂的生产长期处于不合理的状态。沈阳日报描绘了该厂生产混乱情况的一幅图画：忽松忽紧，月月突击，一方面，设备时常停歇，运用率很低，像今年二月份只发挥了百分之三十八，有一时期停工待料的工时竟占总工时百分之二十八；另一方面，加班加点现象严重，例如去年年底因为眼看全年生产计划要落空，党组织就动员党员和积极分子带头加班加点，科长、技术人员和一般职员都放下自己的工作，下车间和工人一道干活，连院子、办公室也变成了作业现场。该厂生产过程缺乏完善的管理制度，经常处于混乱状态，则长期不能完成国家的计划，就是很自然的事了。
    由于沈阳日报所揭发的电工十五厂不能准确完成国家计划的事实是带有普遍性的问题，而该报所指出的该厂企业管理工作远远落后于生产发展的要求又是许多企业共同存在的矛盾；因此这个问题一经报纸严重地提出，就在群众中起了较为广泛的教育作用。电工十五厂职工通过报纸的教育，认识了完成国家计划的意义。业务科长丛培民给报纸写道：“过去我们也谈到必须树立‘国家的计划就是法律’的观点，但究竟为什么必须树立这种观点，思想上是不明确的；过去我们也谈到必须为大规模经济建设服务，但很少联系到本厂的实际。在这次报纸揭发我厂给国家造成的损失后，我明白了这些道理，因此感到很惭愧。”机械二厂、四厂、七厂和电工五厂等单位的职工，都学习了沈阳日报关于电工十五厂的报道，并进行了初步讨论。电工五厂检查科副科长蒋玉树在讨论中说：“电工十五厂的教训使我们认识到厂与厂之间、一个厂的科与科之间、科与车间之间都是互相关联着的，就好像一个钟表，缺少一个零件也不行。所以每个单位都必须发挥它应有的作用，使整个国家向着工业化前进。”机械四厂副厂长赵翰林、电机厂副厂长吕凤仪等并联系本厂在完成国家计划和企业管理方面的缺点，在报上作了自我检查。
    为坚决完成国家计划而斗争，是我们报纸在国家经济建设时期一项经常的重要的宣传任务。报纸要善于及时表扬那些均衡地、全面地完成和超过国家计划的单位，并及时批评那些不能完成国家计划的单位，同时分析完成得好或完成得不好的原因，指出改进生产的途径。沈阳日报选择了电工十五厂作为典型，有力地进行了“坚决完成国家计划”的宣传，这是正确的。但是，沈阳日报在这一方面的宣传还有值得改进的地方。如该报提出这个问题为时较晚，该报虽然在四月一日就曾揭发了电工十五厂长期不能完成生产任务的事实，但由于问题提得凌乱而不突出，因此并未引起群众的注意；到五月十八日再次明确提出这一问题，就起了很大作用。又如目前在某些干部中还存在着“基本建设第一，生产不重要了”的错误思想，而电工十五厂的例子正足以有力地批驳这种思想；可是该报还没有联系这个问题来进行批评。我们的报纸应该从多方面来深入地批判各种各样忽视生产、忽视完成国家计划的思想，应该用活生生的事实向存有这种思想的人敲警钟，教育他们确立“国家的计划就是法律”的观念。
