Guangdong Province Vigorously Rescues Flood Victims

From the end of May to the beginning of June, heavy thunderstorms occurred in the coastal and riverine areas of Guangdong Province. Mountain torrents erupted, and the water levels of various rivers rose sharply. The Zengjiang and Longjiang rivers have exceeded the highest recorded flood levels. Thirty-six counties in the province have suffered varying degrees of flooding. In Longmen County, mountain torrents struck fiercely, with floodwaters reaching a height of thirteen feet, submerging four villages to three inches above the rooftops and collapsing more than 1,400 houses. In the severely affected areas of Lufeng County, rice paddy production is estimated to be reduced by about 50%.

After the floods occurred, the Provincial People's Government held three emergency meetings and established a joint headquarters for flood prevention, typhoon defense, production, and disaster relief. On June 7th, it issued an emergency directive on flood prevention, rescue, and disaster relief work, proposing five emergency measures. The Secretary-General of the Provincial People's Government and two Deputy Directors of the Civil Affairs Department and the Department of Agriculture and Forestry led working groups to the disaster areas to direct operations on the ground and resolve difficulties. Disaster areas immediately suspended other work and urgently mobilized manpower and resources for rescue. The person in charge of the provincial headquarters and responsible cadres of the Yuezhong Administrative Office were frequently stationed in Shilong and Shitan, key areas downstream of the Dongjiang River, directing the dispatch of ships, grain, and other supplies to support the disaster areas. In the extremely important Shijiao Embankment (dike) in Qingyuan County, five or six hundred cadres and tens of thousands of people guarded it day and night. The Provincial People's Government has already allocated 5 billion yuan each to eastern and central Guangdong and 2 billion yuan to northern Guangdong for emergency relief after the floods. The General Headquarters has decided to allocate an additional 20 billion yuan in agricultural loans to the disaster areas. Supply and marketing cooperatives have decided to purchase 10 billion yuan worth of local specialty products in the disaster areas. People from all walks of life are also concerned about the disaster-stricken masses. Various organizations have voluntarily donated materials to the disaster areas to express their sympathy. The troops stationed in Guangdong donated one million jin of grain for the disaster victims. Through the active rescue efforts of cadres and the masses, the disaster victims have been initially resettled, and their morale for production is gradually stabilizing. They are vigorously carrying out replanting and supplementary planting. Now, the floodwaters in various rivers are gradually receding, and the people in various places are continuing to step up the guarding and repair of important dikes.

    五月底六月初，广东省沿海沿江地区发生大雷雨，山洪暴发，各江水位暴涨，增江、龙江已超过有记录以来的最高洪水位，全省有三十六县遭受不同程度的水灾。龙门县山洪猛袭，洪水高至一丈三尺，有四个村超过屋顶三寸，塌房一千四百多间；陆丰县受灾严重地区稻田约减产百分之五十。
    水灾发生后，省人民政府召开了三次紧急会议，并成立了防汛防风生产救灾联合总指挥部，于六月七日发布防汛抢险救灾工作的紧急指示，提出五项紧急措施；省人民政府秘书长和民政厅、农林厅的两个副厅长都率领工作组分赴灾区，就地指挥，解决困难。灾区立即暂停其他工作，紧急动员人力物力抢救。省指挥部负责人及粤中行署负责干部经常在东江下游关键地区的石龙、石滩指挥，调度船只、粮食等支援灾区。在极为重要的清远县石角围
    （堤），每天有五、六百干部和数万群众守护。省人民政府已拨给粤东、粤中救济款各五十亿元，粤北二十亿元，作为洪灾后急救之用。总指挥部已决定增拨灾区农贷二百亿元。供销合作社已决定以一百亿元在灾区收购土特产品。各界人民对受灾群众也很关怀，各机关自动捐献物资到灾区慰问，驻粤部队为灾民捐出了一百万斤粮食。经过干部、群众的积极抢救，灾民已初步得到安置，生产情绪渐趋稳定，正大力进行改种、补种。现在各江洪水陆续下退，各地人民对各重要堤围仍在继续加紧守护抢修。
