	Revolutionary Writer Jiang Guangci's Remains Reburied in Hongqiao Cemetery
	Today (June 30th) marks the 22nd anniversary of the death of the revolutionary writer Jiang Guangci. Jiang Guangci, originally named Jiang Guangchi, actively participated in student movements during the May Fourth period. Soon after, he joined the Chinese Communist Party and was sent to study in the Soviet Union. He loved literature and wrote many poems abroad, most of which were collected in his later published poetry collection "New Dream." After returning to China, he taught at Shanghai University. At the end of 1927, he organized the "Sun Society" and published the "Sun Monthly" in January of the following year. Subsequently, he edited revolutionary publications such as "New Current," "Pioneer," and "Sea Breeze."
	Jiang Guangci's important works include the poetry collections "New Dream" and "War Drums," novels "The Wandering Boy," "On the Yalu River," "The Shorts Party," "Wild Sacrifice," "The Last Smile," and "The Wind in the Fields," etc. He also translated Libedinsky's "A Week," Romanov's "Love's Divide," and the Soviet short story collection "Winter's Spring Smile," etc. His major works have been compiled into the "Selected Works of Jiang Guangci" (Kaiming Bookstore edition).
	In the summer of 1931, Jiang Guangci died of intestinal tuberculosis in Shanghai. His remains were buried in Shanghai Cemetery. During the period of enemy occupation and puppet regime, the site was flooded due to the planned construction of an airport in the area. Recently, the Shanghai Federation of Literary and Art Circles, together with Jiang's friends, searched for clues from various sources and finally found the remains, which have now been officially reburied in Hongqiao Cemetery. The inscription on the tombstone, "Tomb of the Writer Jiang Guangci," was written by Chen Yi, the Mayor of Shanghai. Shanghai literary and art circles attended the funeral.
