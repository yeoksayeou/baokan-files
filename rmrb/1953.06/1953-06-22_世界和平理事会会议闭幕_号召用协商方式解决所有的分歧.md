Xinhua News Agency, June 21st dispatch from Budapest: The World Peace Council meeting closed on the 20th. The closing session was chaired by Japanese representative Ikuo Oyama.

Gabriel d'Arboussier (Black Africa), member of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council and Vice-President of the Council, presented the draft declaration on launching a world movement for peace, prepared by the meeting's General Political Issues Committee. He reported on the work of the Political Committee, saying: After studying all the proposals, especially that of Mr. Soek, head of the Indian delegation, the Political Committee drafted a declaration on launching a world movement for peace.

D'Arboussier said that this document was formulated based on four concepts: Under the current circumstances, the principle of peaceful coexistence of various systems and regimes is not only necessary but also possible and beneficial to all; peaceful coexistence can only be guaranteed through consultation and negotiation to resolve all differences; many issues threaten world peace, so it is essential to strive for negotiated solutions; and finally, despite the undeniable victories we have achieved, we cannot relax our efforts, for the results will be undone if we slacken even slightly.

D'Arboussier read out the draft declaration, which was unanimously and enthusiastically adopted by the meeting participants.

Next to speak was Emilio Sereni (Italy), member of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council. He informed the assembly that the committee discussing ways and means of promoting negotiation to ease international tension had adopted several decisions.

Following this, a group of Hungarian children entered the venue. A girl, representing the children, saluted the assembly and asked the representatives to strengthen the fight for peace.

After a brief recess, the meeting continued, chaired by Dastier de la Vigerie (France).

Pierre Cot (France) spoke, emphasizing that the struggle to ease international tension is now the primary task of peace fighters. However, easing international tension is not the same as peace. We must strive for peace and international cooperation.

Pierre Cot pointed out that there is hope for easing international tension. He emphasized that peace fighters will welcome any proposal advocating consultations aimed at easing international tensions. Pierre Cot said: A temporary agreement, even if limited in scope, is better than a comprehensive but unattainable agreement.

Soek, head of the Indian delegation, also spoke at the closing session. He said: This Budapest meeting of the World Peace Council is a great step forward in the struggle for peace. He emphasized the importance of launching a movement for consultation and negotiation everywhere.

Dastier de la Vigerie expressed his gratitude to all those who were invited to participate in the meeting for their contributions to the cause of peace, and expressed sincere thanks to the Hungarian people for their hospitality.

Dastier de la Vigerie read out the draft declaration of the World Peace Council, which was unanimously adopted.

The full text of the declaration is as follows:

“Great hope has emerged. Now everyone sees that agreement is possible. Slaughter can end. The 'Cold War' can be stopped.

At this moment, we solemnly call on the people of all countries to demand that their governments consult and reach agreements.

We all have a responsibility to support every action that seeks to resolve disputes peacefully, no matter which government that action may come from. We have a responsibility to thwart the activities of those who obstruct and delay agreements.

We have the ability to achieve peace. We have a responsibility to win peace.”

With this, the World Peace Council meeting was adjourned.

Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, June 21st: The World Peace Council held its closing session on the 20th.

At the beginning of the meeting, everyone stood in silence to mourn the Rosenbergs, who were illegally executed by the U.S. government. The chairman of the meeting, Japanese representative Ikuo Oyama, said that the meeting expressed great anger at this unjust act by the U.S. government, and called on everyone to redouble their efforts to eliminate all unjust acts.

In the speeches at the meeting, the speech by Pierre Cot, who had just arrived from France to attend the closing session, was warmly welcomed by the participants. When he called on everyone to work harder to ensure that the flame of easing international tensions would not be extinguished by malicious winds, and to let this flame burn brighter and bring light and life to people, the entire audience stood up, and applause continued for a long time.

The presentation of flowers by Hungarian children was the most moving scene at the closing session. Hungarian Young Pioneers wearing red scarves poured into the venue from both sides. They threw flowers at the representatives. A Hungarian child addressed the meeting, saying that we Hungarian children are prepared to dedicate the most beautiful flowers to the person who can utter the most beautiful words. There are many beautiful words, but only one word can encompass all beautiful words, and that is: "Peace."

As the meeting was about to end, the chairman announced that the World Peace Council Declaration had been adopted by all representatives, and he said: "From tomorrow on, this declaration will be the declaration of the people of the world." At this moment, a storm of applause resounded throughout the venue.

    世界和平理事会会议闭幕
    号召用协商方式解决所有的分歧
    【新华社二十一日讯】据塔斯社布达佩斯讯：世界和平理事会会议在二十日闭幕。闭幕会议由日本代表大山郁夫担任主席。
    世界和平理事会常务委员会委员、理事会副主席加布里尔·达波赛（黑非洲）提出了会议关于一般政治问题委员会拟订的展开世界争取和平运动的宣言草案，他报告政治委员会的工作说：政治委员会在研究了所有的建议、特别是印度代表团团长索克的建议后，拟定了一项关于展开世界争取和平运动的宣言草案。
    达波赛说，这一文件是根据四个概念制定的，在目前情况下，各种制度和政权和平共处的原则不仅是必要的，而且是可能的，对大家有利的；唯有通过协商，解决所有的分歧，和平共处才能得到保证；现在有许多问题威胁着世界和平，因此努力争取以协商方式解决这些问题是十分必要的；最后，也就是第四个概念是，尽管我们已经取得了许多无容置疑的胜利，可是我们不能松懈我们的努力，如果我们稍有懈怠，结果就会前功尽弃。
    达波赛宣读了这个宣言草案，参加会议的代表一致地并且十分热烈地通过了这个宣言草案。
    接着发言的是世界和平理事会常务委员会委员埃米略·塞伦尼（意大利），他告诉大会，讨论进行提倡协商来缓和国际紧张局势的运动的方式与办法的委员会已经通过几项决定。
    接着，一队匈牙利儿童进入会场。一个女孩代表儿童队向大会致敬，并且要求代表们加强争取和平的斗争。
    会议休会片刻以后继续进行，由达斯迪埃·德拉维热里（法国）担任主席。
    皮埃尔·戈特（法国）发言，他强调指出，现在，争取缓和国际紧张局势的斗争是和平战士的主要任务。但是国际紧张局势的缓和并不等于和平。我们必须争取和平与国际合作。
    皮埃尔·戈特指出，缓和国际紧张局势已有希望。他强调指出，和平战士将欢迎任何主张举行旨在缓和国际局势的协商的建议。皮埃尔·戈特说：一个虽然是暂时的、虽然是范围有限的协议，还是比一个全面的、但是不能达到的协议要好。
    印度代表团团长索克也在闭幕会议上发言。他说：这次世界和平理事会布达佩斯会议在争取和平的斗争中是一个巨大的进展。他强调指出在每一个地方展开争取协商的运动的重要性。
    达斯迪埃·德拉维热里对于所有被邀请参加会议的人们对和平事业的贡献表示谢意，并对匈牙利人民的殷勤招待表示诚挚的感谢。
    达斯迪埃·德拉维热里宣读了世界和平理事会宣言草案，它得到了全体一致通过。
    宣言全文如下：
    “很大的希望已经出现了。现在每个人都看到协议是可能的。屠杀能够结束。‘冷战’能够制止。
    在这个时刻，我们庄严地号召各国人民要求他们的政府进行协商并达成协议。
    我们大家有责任支持用和平方式解决争端的每一个行动，不管这种行动可能来自那个政府。我们有责任挫败那些阻挠并拖延协议的人的活动。
    我们有能力实现和平。我们有责任来赢得和平。”
    至此，世界和平理事会会议即宣告结束。
    【新华社布达佩斯二十一日电】世界和平理事会二十日举行闭幕会议。
    会议开始时，全体起立为被美国政府非法处死的罗森堡夫妇致哀。会议主席、日本代表大山郁夫说，会议对于美国政府这一非正义的行动表示极大的愤怒，会议号召大家加倍努力来扫除一切非正义的行为。
    在会议的发言中，刚从法国赶来参加闭幕会议的皮埃尔·戈特的发言受到了与会者的热烈欢迎。当他号召大家更加努力使缓和国际局势的火焰不要被恶毒的邪风所吹灭，让这个火焰燃烧得更明亮并给人们带来光明和生命时，全场起立，掌声经久不息。
    匈牙利儿童的献花是闭幕会议上最动人的场面。围着红领巾的匈牙利少年先锋队队员们从两边涌进了会场。他们向代表们的身上抛掷鲜花。一个匈牙利儿童向会议致词说，我们匈牙利的孩子们准备把最美丽的鲜花献给那个能够说出最美丽的字眼的人，有许多美丽的字眼，但只有一个字眼能把一切美丽的字眼包括在内，那就是：“和平”。
    当会议快结束时，会议主席宣布世界和平理事会宣言已为全体代表所通过，他并说：“从明天起这个宣言就将是世界人民的宣言了”。这时，暴风雨般的掌声响彻全场。
