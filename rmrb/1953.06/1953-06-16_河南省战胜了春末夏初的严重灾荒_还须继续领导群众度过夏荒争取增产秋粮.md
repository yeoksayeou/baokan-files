Henan Province's Party committees at all levels led the masses in overcoming a severe drought in late spring and early summer this year. In the process of overcoming difficulties, they strengthened the unified leadership of the Party, changed leadership methods and work styles, increased the confidence of the peasant masses in fighting natural disasters, and strengthened the connection between the Party and the broad masses. On April 11, just as the entire province was carrying out spring plowing and sowing intensively, it was suddenly hit by severe frost. Wheat in 97 of the province's 117 counties was affected, and people's production and lives were severely impacted. At that time, the masses were pessimistic and disappointed, their thinking was confused; cadres were anxious and at a loss, and the grain market situation was very tense for a time.

At the advent of the drought, the Henan Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial People's Government immediately convened an emergency meeting, thoroughly and comprehensively analyzed the situation, redeployed work, and determined that production for disaster relief was the central task overriding all others in the province. They were determined to strengthen economic work, mobilize all cadres to recognize the serious situation caused by the frost and the favorable conditions for overcoming the drought, resolutely rely on and organize the masses to overcome difficulties and defeat the drought. The entire province organized and mobilized tens of thousands of cadres (an average of more than three per township), led by cadres responsible at all levels of the Party committee, to go deep into the disaster areas, vigorously lead the masses in protecting wheat, replanting seedlings, and preparing for drought, to ensure good spring plowing and sowing, and strive to increase autumn grain production.

The trade departments also fully supported production and disaster relief, strengthening the work of purchasing local and special products and supplying production materials. By the end of April, the total value of local cloth, reed mats, lime, millstones, straw hats, etc. purchased by supply and marketing cooperatives from disaster victims alone was 106.6 billion yuan. At the same time, more than 11,000 liberation-type waterwheels were supplied. In March and April, more than 87.4 million jin of fertilizer (excluding chemical fertilizers, most of which was processed locally from sesame, beans, cotton kernels, etc.), 3,000 sprayers, 10 million jin of various insecticides, and 12,800 pieces of various small farm implements were supplied. The grain departments earnestly grasped the correct policy, ascertained the grain situation, carried out planned transfer and supply, controlled grain prices, stabilized the market, and resolutely stopped and cracked down on illegal private merchants taking the opportunity to disrupt the grain market.

Cadres in the disaster areas deeply understood the suffering of the peasants, listened to their demands, universally shared joys and sorrows and labored alongside them, and learned and applied the working methods of relying on the masses, mobilizing the masses, focusing on creating experience, and promoting overall work. For example, Wang Desheng, the secretary of the CCP township branch in Yanzhuang Township, Linru County, Xuchang Prefecture, which was severely affected by the disaster, first watered three mu of his own wheat after the frost disaster and applied fertilizer, and the wheat turned green and revived. He immediately held a township branch meeting to mobilize all party members to set an example for the peasants to visit, promoting the watering of more than 1,700 mu of wheat in the township and digging 19 wells. The county party committee convened a meeting of cadres above the level of work team leader, introduced this experience, and organized some experienced old farmers to accompany the work team to participate in the peasant representative meetings of various districts and townships, using their personal experience to carry out propaganda and mobilization, and widely organize the masses to visit the townships that had already watered wheat nearby. In this way, the county promoted the watering of 50,000 mu of wheat. After the entire prefecture vigorously led the masses to water wheat to protect seedlings, another rain fell, and the wheat seedlings gradually improved, greatly reducing the degree of drought, and breaking the old habit of peasants not watering wheat. The 4,594 waterwheels originally planned to be supplied to the peasants in the entire prefecture were snapped up by the peasants, and another 3,000 were added. In the spring plowing production and production disaster relief work, cadres in many areas studied the CCP Central Committee's "Instructions to Party Committees at All Levels on Spring Plowing Production" and changed their leadership methods and work styles. The CCP Xinxiang Prefectural Committee and its subordinate departments, and the cadres of various counties and districts, seriously and conscientiously conducted in-depth inspections from the perspectives of guiding ideology, organizational leadership, and work style regarding the reasons for not "regarding production as the central task overriding all others." They emphasized the need to be "focused," "in-depth," and "thorough" in spring plowing production and production disaster relief, and opposed decentralism; at the same time, they emphasized that all departments should serve production disaster relief in their respective business positions. The entire prefecture organized more than 4,000 cadres to go to the countryside to lead the masses in production and disaster relief. The agricultural technology departments and farms studied the laws of wheat disaster and remedial measures, and provided technical guidance; the financial and trade departments actively improved their business and vigorously cooperated. For example, the grain department guaranteed the supply of grain to disaster victims and grain-deficient households; the bank's second-quarter loan plan was 27 billion yuan, and from early April to mid-May, more than 17 billion yuan was lent out; the cooperative sold 2,000 waterwheels in April, and another 1,600 in early May. The work of all departments was concentrated and unified under the central task of production disaster relief.

After Zhengzhou Prefecture suffered a frost disaster, the Party committee strengthened the political and ideological education of cadres, controlled work tasks, and concentrated cadres' efforts to lead the masses in watering wheat to protect seedlings, develop sideline production, and collect substitutes for food to overcome the disaster. In addition, areas such as Anyang and Puyang Prefectures also strengthened the unified leadership of the Party, and cadres studied Ren Guodong's working methods. The atmosphere of leadership taking the lead, grasping key points, and going deep into the production process has taken shape.

After the tense work of cadres and the masses, spring sowing was completed in all parts of the province, most of the wheat seedlings improved, production preparation for the drought was carried out, and the mood of the peasants stabilized. The masses also had a cordial attitude towards the cadres; when the work teams left many villages, the masses were reluctant to part.

The main problems existing in the current rural work in Henan are: although the spring drought has basically been overcome, due to reduced wheat production (the average harvest in the province is about 60%, but it is very uneven), a severe summer drought is following closely behind; although the mood of the masses has been initially stabilized, it is not yet consolidated, and the implementation of production policies is still very poor; although the thinking and work style of cadres have been improved, they are still not familiar with production policies, lack experience in leading production and construction, and cannot penetrate deeply; although the phenomenon of "five excesses" has been initially reversed, new working methods, work systems, and organizational structures have not yet been established; and economic work still needs to be strengthened.

In late May, the Henan Provincial Party Committee convened an expanded meeting of the Provincial Party Committee, which summarized the spring work and determined the future work guidelines in light of the actual work situation in the province. In addition to calling on the entire Party to continue to learn how to do a good job in economic work, the meeting emphasized the need to seize the summer harvest and summer planting, ensure timely sowing, and strive for a bumper autumn harvest in specific rural work; and to pay attention to conscientiously implementing production policies and legally reducing and exempting policies in the summer harvest and summer requisition. At the same time, it pointed out that it is necessary to prevent and overcome the complacency of cadres, continue to organize forces to go deep into the disaster areas, verify the disaster situation, and vigorously lead the masses throughout the province to overcome difficulties and survive the summer drought.

    河南省战胜了春末夏初的严重灾荒
    还须继续领导群众度过夏荒争取增产秋粮
    河南省各级党委在今年春末夏初领导群众战胜了严重的灾荒。在克服困难的过程中，加强了党的统一领导，改变了领导方法和领导作风，提高了农民群众和自然灾害作斗争的信心，密切了党和广大群众的联系。四月十一日，正当全省紧张进行春耕播种的时候，突遭严霜袭击，全省一百一十七个县中有九十七个县的小麦受灾，人民的生产和生活受到严重的影响。当时，群众悲观失望，思想混乱；干部焦躁惶惑，束手无策；粮食市场情况一时非常紧张。
    中共河南省委和省人民政府在灾荒临头之际，立即召开紧急会议，深入地全面地分析了情况，重新部署了工作，确定以生产救灾为全省压倒一切的中心任务，切实加强经济工作；动员全体干部认清由霜灾所引起的严重情况和战胜灾荒的有利条件，坚决地依靠和组织群众克服困难，战胜灾荒。全省组织动员了几万干部（平均每乡在三人以上），由各级党委负责干部率领，深入灾区，大力领导群众保麦、补苗、生产备荒，保证做好春耕播种，力争增产秋粮。
    贸易部门也以全力支持生产救灾，加强了收购土产特产和供应生产资料的工作。到四月底，仅供销合作社收购灾民的土布、苇席、石灰、磨石、草帽等的总值就有一千零六十六亿元，同时供应了解放式水车一万一千多部。三、四月份供应肥料（除化学肥料外，大部是在当地收购芝麻、豆、棉仁等加工的）八千七百四十余万斤，喷雾器三千部，各种杀虫药剂一千万斤，各种小农具一万二千八百件。粮食部门切实掌握正确方针，摸清了粮食情况，进行有计划的调运、供应，掌握粮价，稳定市场，坚决制止和打击了不法私商乘机捣乱粮食市场的行为。
    灾区的干部深切体察了农民的疾苦，倾听了农民的要求，普遍与农民共甘苦、同劳动，学习和运用了依靠群众、发动群众，重点创造经验推动全面的工作方法。例如受灾严重的许昌专区临汝县阎庄乡中共乡支部书记王德胜，在霜灾发生后，自己首先浇了三亩麦，上了肥田粉，麦子返青复活了，立即开了乡支部会，动员全体党员做出榜样让农民参观，推动全乡浇麦一千七百多亩，并打了十九眼井。县委召开了工作组长以上的干部会，介绍了这个经验；并组织了一部分有经验的老农，随工作组参加各区、乡的农民代表会，以亲身经验进行宣传动员，广泛组织群众到就近已经浇麦的乡参观。这样，推动全县农民浇麦达五万亩。全专区大力领导群众浇麦保苗后，又落了一场雨，麦苗逐渐好转，灾荒程度大为减轻，并由此打破了农民不浇麦的旧习惯。全专区原计划供应农民的四千五百九十四部水车，被农民争购一空，又追加了三千部。在春耕生产和生产救灾工作中，不少地区的干部学习了中共中央“关于春耕生产给各级党委的指示”，改变了领导方法和领导作风。中共新乡地委及所属各部门，各县、区干部，严肃认真地从指导思想、组织领导和工作作风上，深入检查了没有“把生产当作压倒一切的中心任务”的原因，强调了在春耕生产和生产救灾工作中要“集中”、“深入”、“钻研”，反对分散主义；同时也强调各部门应在自己的业务岗位上为生产救灾服务。全专区组织了四千多名干部下乡领导群众生产救灾，农业技术部门和农场研究了小麦受灾的规律及补救办法，进行技术指导；金融贸易部门则积极改进业务，大力配合。如粮食部门保证了对灾民及缺粮户的粮食供应；银行第二季度贷款计划为二百七十亿元，从四月上旬到五月中旬即贷出一百七十余亿元；合作社四月份销水车二千部，五月上旬又销了一千六百部。各部门的工作在生产救灾的中心任务下集中统一起来了。
    郑州专区遭霜灾后，党委加强了对干部的政治思想教育，控制了工作任务，使干部集中力量领导群众浇麦保苗，开展副业生产，采集代食品，战胜了灾荒。此外如安阳、濮阳等专区也加强了党的统一领导，干部学习了任国栋的工作方法，领导带头、掌握重点、深入生产过程已形成风气。
    经过干部群众紧张工作，全省各地春播完成了，麦苗大部好转，生产备荒工作开展起来了，农民情绪稳定了。群众对干部的态度也亲切了；不少村庄工作组走时，群众依依不舍。
    当前河南农村工作中存在的主要问题是：春荒虽已基本度过，但由于小麦减产（全省收成平均约六成左右，但很不平衡），严重的夏荒接踵而来；群众情绪虽初步稳定，但还不巩固，生产政策贯彻得还很差；干部思想和工作作风虽有提高和改进，但对生产政策还不熟悉，对领导生产建设还缺乏经验，钻不进去；“五多”现象虽初步扭转，但新的工作方法、工作制度、组织机构还没有建立起来；经济工作也还需要继续加强。
    五月下旬，中共河南省委召开了省委扩大会议，总结了春季工作，针对着当前全省的实际工作情况确定了今后工作方针。会议除号召全党继续学习做好经济工作外，对农村的具体工作强调抓紧夏收夏种，保证及时播种，争取秋季丰收；并注意在夏收夏征中认真贯彻生产政策和依法减免政策。同时指出：必须防止和克服干部的麻痹自满情绪，继续组织力量，深入灾区，查实灾情，大力领导全省群众克服困难，度过夏荒。    （本报河南记者站）
