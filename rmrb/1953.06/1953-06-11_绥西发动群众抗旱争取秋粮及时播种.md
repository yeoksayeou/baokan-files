Sui Xi Mobilizes the Masses to Fight Drought and Strive for Timely Planting of Autumn Grain

The Yellow River water level has dropped to an unprecedented level, making it difficult for various main canals in the Sui Xi area to draw water. The Shanba Special District has transferred a large number of cadres to various counties to lead drought prevention and drought resistance work. In the western part of Suiyuan, most of the irrigation depends on the Yellow River canal water. Many cadres and masses believe that the Houtao area does not rely on rainfall for food, and they do not pay much attention to drought prevention and drought resistance. However, since the spring of this year, the Yellow River water level has dropped to an unprecedented level. In late May, the inflow was only 307 cubic meters per second (compared to 1,700 cubic meters per second at the same time last year), which is unprecedented in recent years. Only three of the eight major canals in Sui Xi can draw a small amount of water, five canals cannot draw water, and all fourteen small canals directly connected to the Yellow River cannot draw water at all. Therefore, drought has seriously threatened the planting work in Sui Xi and the wheat and summer crops that need irrigation.

The CCP Shanba Prefectural Committee convened an emergency meeting of the Prefectural Committee members, the Director of the Special District Water Conservancy Bureau, and the Director of the Huangyangzha Engineering Office on the night of May 25th, and decided to transfer cadres from various departments to form drought prevention and drought resistance work teams to go to various counties to organize the masses to fight drought. Members of the Prefectural Committee, Deputy Commissioners of the Commissioner's Office, and cadres at the section chief level all participated in this work. The specific measures for drought resistance are as follows:

I. Strengthen ideological leadership in drought prevention and drought resistance. Each county convened an emergency mobilization meeting at the county level on May 27th to study emergency measures suitable for local drought resistance, and organized drought resistance work groups headed by county leaders to go to various districts, mobilizing at all levels to overcome negative waiting, complacency, and pessimism, and mobilizing the masses to participate in the struggle against drought.

II. Strive to expand water sources, conserve water, and strive to irrigate more land. County leading cadres and directors of water conservancy bureaus personally went to the canal mouths of various main canals to do their best to dredge small channels and expand water sources according to the specific conditions of the canals; and strengthen embankment protection to prevent any branch canals and sub-branch canals from breaching. At the same time, cooperate in promoting the high-yield experience of "shallow irrigation" to achieve shallow irrigation, rapid rotation, and day and night rotation irrigation; and formulate a temporary water use system to implement mutual assistance in irrigation.

III. Extensively study the experience of drought resistance and prevention over the years with the masses, seize successful examples to expand publicity, educate the masses with the experience of the masses, and strive to plant as much as possible. Supply and marketing cooperatives should promptly supply early-maturing crop seeds (small red millet and buckwheat) for planting in drought-stricken areas and replanting after wheat harvest.

    绥西发动群众抗旱争取秋粮及时播种
    黄河水位空前下降，绥西地区各干渠进水困难，陕坝专区抽调大批干部到各县领导防旱抗旱工作。绥远西部地区，大部靠黄河渠水灌溉，不少干部及群众认为后套不靠天雨吃饭，对防旱抗旱很不重视。但自今年春季以来，黄河水位空前下降，五月下旬每秒进水量仅三○七立方公尺（去年此时为每秒一七○○立方公尺），为几年以来所未有。绥西八大干渠只有三个渠能少量进水，五个渠不能进水，有十四个直通黄河的小干渠全部不能进水。因此，干旱已严重地威胁着绥西的播种工作和需要浇水的小麦及夏禾。
    中共陕坝地委于五月二十五日连夜召集地委委员、专区水利局长及黄杨闸工程处长等开紧急会议，决定抽调各部门干部组织防旱抗旱工作团，分赴各县组织群众抗旱。地委委员，专署正副专员及科长级干部全体参加了这个工作。抗旱的具体措施如下：
    一、加强防旱抗旱的思想领导。各县于五月二十七日召开县一级抗旱紧急动员会议，研究适合当地抗旱的紧急办法，并以县领导同志为首组织抗旱工作组，分赴各区，层层发动，克服消极等待、麻痹大意及悲观失望情绪，动员群众参加防旱抗旱斗争。
    二、努力扩大水源，节约用水，争取多浇地。各县领导干部及水利局长等亲到各干渠渠口，按照渠道具体情况，尽力疏通小道，扩大水源；并加强护堤工作，不使任何支渠及支子渠决口。同时，配合推广“浅浇”的丰产经验，做到浅浇、快轮、日夜轮浇；并制定临时用水制度，实行互助浇地。
    三、广泛地和群众研究历年抗旱防旱经验，抓住成功的事例扩大宣传，用群众的经验教育群众，尽量争取种上。供销合作社应及时供应早熟作物种子（小红糜及荞麦），以备旱灾区播种及麦收后复种。（王志民、赵国兴）
