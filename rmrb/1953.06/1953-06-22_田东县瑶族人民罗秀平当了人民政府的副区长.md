    Luo Xiuping, a Yao Nationality Person from Tiandong County, Becomes Deputy District Head of the People's Government
    Letter from Huang Fengxiang, a reader in Tiandong County, Guangxi Province: Luo Xiuping, a Yao nationality person from Meilin Township, Sixth District of Tiandong County, is a figure beloved by the local Yao people. Now, he has become the Deputy District Head of the Sixth District of Tiandong County.
    Comrade Luo Xiuping lost his parents when he was very young and lived a life of hardship. He worked as a hired laborer for landlords from the age of eleven, enduring beatings and scolding every day. At the age of sixteen, he entered a normal school; three years later, he became a primary school teacher in the Sixth District of Tiandong County. At this time, his life was still very difficult. At the same time, he saw that the Yao working people also lived the same difficult lives under the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, which made him gradually recognize the crimes of the Kuomintang rule. In 1949, he finally joined the Zuojiang Guerrilla. Under his leadership, thirty-one Yao people also joined the revolution.
    After liberation, he served as the production committee member of Jiefang Township, a Yao nationality settlement area in Tiandong County. In the work of suppressing bandits, he actively mobilized the masses and was often responsible for leading the way to pursue and suppress bandits, and his work was very successful. Therefore, in November 1950, he was elected as a county people's representative; later he was elected as a people's representative of the Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Region and the entire province. Before each meeting, he could go deep into the masses to collect opinions; after returning, he would convey the spirit of the resolutions in the meeting to the masses in detail and organize the masses to implement them.
    Comrade Luo Xiuping's progress has been rapid under the constant cultivation and education of the Party and the People's Government. He uses hard work to respond to the care of the Party and Chairman Mao for the Yao people. He closely connects with the local masses, publicizes policies to them, and organizes them to work hard for their greater happiness. The Yao masses in various townships of the Sixth District all know the name Luo Xiuping and trust him very much. Recently, he was appointed as the Deputy District Head of the Sixth District of Tiandong County. The Yao people all said with great joy: Under the leadership of the Communist Party, our Yao people have also become district heads!

专栏：读者来信摘要

    田东县瑶族人民罗秀平当了人民政府的副区长
    广西省田东县读者黄凤翔来信：田东县六区梅林乡的瑶族人民罗秀平，是当地瑶族人民所爱戴的人物。现在，他当了田东县第六区的副区长。
    罗秀平同志很小时就死了父母，一直过着苦日子。他从十一岁起就给地主打工，整天挨受打气。十六岁时，他进师范学校念书；三年后，在田东县六区做小学教师。这时，他生活仍然十分困苦。同时，他看到了瑶族劳动人民在国民党反动统治下也过着同样的困苦生活，这使他慢慢认识了国民党统治的罪恶。一九四九年他终于参加了左江游击队。在他的带动下，有三十一个瑶族人民也参加了革命。
    解放后，他担任了田东县瑶族聚居区解放乡的生产委员。在剿匪工作中，他积极发动群众，并经常负责带路追剿土匪，工作很有成绩。因此，在一九五○年十一月，他当选为县人民代表；以后又被选为桂西僮族自治区和全省的人民代表。他每次去开会以前，都能深入群众搜集意见；回来又都将会议中决议的精神向群众详细地传达，组织群众来执行。
    罗秀平同志在党和人民政府不断的培养教育下，进步是很快的。他用努力工作来回答党和毛主席对瑶族人民的关怀。他密切地联系着当地群众，向他们宣传政策，并组织他们为谋求自己更大的幸福生活而努力。六区各乡的瑶族群众都知道罗秀平这个名字，并很信任他。最近他被任为田东县第六区的副区长。瑶族人民都兴高采烈地说：在共产党领导下，我们瑶族人民也当上了区长！
