    The Yangzhou Grain Department Should Not Neglect Grain Transportation and Disaster Relief Work
    A letter from Zhang Guisheng and more than 20 representatives of 57 private boats in Yixing Port: We are boatmen from Yixing County Port. In response to the government's call to transport grain to relieve the disaster-stricken people in northern Jiangsu, we voluntarily signed up to participate in the grain transportation work. During our work, we found that the Yangzhou Grain Department has serious bureaucratic work styles. For example, when we transported 2.3 million catties of grain to Yangzhou for unloading at 8:00 AM on May 16th, the cadres of the Yangzhou Directly Subordinate First Warehouse and the Northern Jiangsu Rice Mill were indifferent. They rigidly enforced their work schedules, working from 8:00 AM to 11:30 AM in the morning and from 1:30 PM to 5:30 PM in the afternoon. Moreover, they only used four scales to receive grain each day. We reported this situation to Section Chief Chen of the Northern Jiangsu Rice Mill, but Section Chief Chen replied, "Huaiyin and Yancheng are disaster areas, but Yangzhou is not a disaster area, so this has nothing to do with us." Another example is that on the 19th, the rice on one boat was almost unloaded, with only a little over two hundred catties remaining, but the end of the working day had arrived. The boatmen requested to unload it all that day, but the comrades of the First Warehouse, for their personal rest, actually said that the time was up and that they would unload it tomorrow, refusing to work an extra hour or two. On another occasion, we saw a lot of rice being scattered on the ground when the grain was being put into the warehouse. In order to prevent the grain from being lost, we organized the boatmen's family members to pick up the rice scattered on the ground, intending to hand it over to the grain receiving warehouse. Unexpectedly, we were stopped by the factory's guards. Director Zhu of the First Warehouse even ridiculed us, saying, "I have never seen such boatmen" (meaning that we boatmen were stingy and wanted to take advantage, even sweeping up one or two grains of rice).
    The above situation has created a very bad impression among our boatmen. Therefore, we request that the relevant departments quickly send personnel to inspect and order those bureaucrats who do not care about the interests of the masses to make a profound self-criticism.

### 扬州粮食部门不该漠视运粮救灾工作

专栏：读者来信摘要

    扬州粮食部门不该漠视运粮救灾工作
    宜兴港五十七条民船的代表张贵生等二十余人来信：我们是宜兴县港籍的船民，为了响应政府运粮救济苏北灾民的号召，我们自动报名参加运粮工作。在工作中我们发现扬州粮食部门，存在着严重的官僚主义作风。比如当我们把二百三十万斤粮食在五月十六日上午八时运到扬州下卸时，扬州市直属第一仓库及苏北机米厂干部却漠不关心，他们生硬执行作息制度，每天上午八点钟办公，十一点半下班，下午一点半办公，五点半休息。而且每天只以四架磅秤来收粮。我们向苏北机米厂的陈股长反映了这种情况，而陈股长却回答说：“淮阴、盐城是灾区，我们扬州又不是灾区，这与我们无关。”又如十九日有一只船的稻子已快卸清，仅剩下二百余斤，但下班时间已到，船民要求当天卸清，而第一仓库的同志为了个人休息，竟说时间已过，明天再卸，不肯再多作一、两小时的工作。另一次，我们见粮食入库时，撒了不少稻子在地上，为了不使粮食遭受损失，我们便将船民家属组织起来，把抛撒在地上的稻子拣拾起来，准备交给收粮仓库，没想到竟遭到厂方警卫员的阻止。第一仓库的朱主任还讥笑我们说：“我从来没有看见过这样的船民”（意思是说我们船民小气，想占便宜，连一粒二粒稻子都要扫起来）。
    以上情况在我们船民中造成很恶劣的影响，因此我们要求有关部门迅速派员检查并责令那些不关心群众利益的官僚主义分子作深刻的检讨。
