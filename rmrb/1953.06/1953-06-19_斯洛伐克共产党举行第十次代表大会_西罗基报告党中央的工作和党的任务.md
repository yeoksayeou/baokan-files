Xinhua News Agency, Prague, June 18th: The Tenth Congress of the Slovak Communist Party was held in Bratislava from the 13th to the 15th, according to TASS.

At the opening of the meeting, Viliam Široký, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Slovak Communist Party, delivered a report on the work of the Central Committee of the Slovak Communist Party and the tasks of the Party.

Široký first analyzed the current international situation in his report. He pointed out that under the leadership of the Soviet Union, the camp of peace, democracy, and socialism has grown stronger and continues to engage in the struggle to safeguard peace with ever-increasing prestige and strength. The characteristic of the current international situation is that the people's desire for peace has reached a worldwide scale and is playing an important role in the development of the international situation. The Soviet Union's unwavering policy of peace has been actively supported by millions of peace-loving people in all countries of the world. Speaking of the domestic situation, Široký pointed out the remarkable achievements made by Slovakia on the national economic front. In industry, compared with 1937, industrial production in the first quarter of this year has increased by 4.5 times. During the same period, heavy industrial production has increased to seven times the pre-war level. By the end of 1952, the production of means of production accounted for 54.9 percent of the total industrial production. During the Two-Year Plan (1947-1948) and the first four years of the Five-Year Plan (1949-1953), more than 100 new and rebuilt large industrial enterprises were constructed. Dozens of large factories currently under construction will soon be officially put into production. In agriculture, by the end of April this year, there were 1,709 unified agricultural cooperatives of the third and fourth types (Note: The third type of cooperative has eliminated field boundaries, carries out collective labor, and the total income of the cooperative is mainly distributed according to the labor of the members, with a small portion of the income distributed according to the area of land each person contributed to the cooperative. In addition to completely eliminating field boundaries and implementing collective farming, the fourth type of cooperative distributes the total income of the cooperative entirely according to the principle of "distribution according to work"). Together with state-owned farms, they account for 45 percent of the total cultivated land. The degree of agricultural mechanization has also been greatly improved. At the beginning of this year, the number of tractors in machine tractor stations has increased to 11 times that of 1949, combine harvesters to 6 times, sheaf binders to 34 times, and threshing machines to 36 times. Široký also talked about the great achievements of the Slovak people in culture and education, and emphasized that the above achievements are closely related to learning and promoting the advanced experience of the Soviet Union.

Široký then talked about the problems existing in Slovakia's industrial and agricultural construction and the tasks of the Party. He pointed out that the Party and trade unions must ensure the full and balanced completion of the Five-Year Plan in terms of quantity and quality, and implement the strictest economy; politically and economically strengthen the unified agricultural cooperatives, and create conditions for further expanding the cooperative movement; and vigorously improve the work of machine tractor stations and state-owned farms.

Finally, Široký talked about the life and development of the Party. He emphasized that this year is the last year of the Five-Year Plan. We are faced with complex and arduous tasks, but at the same time, we are faced with the prospect of further prosperity in the country's economy and culture. However, because the Party has gained rich experience in the process of building socialism and is following the correct path, we are confident that we can solve the problems that the bourgeois government cannot solve, complete the tasks of the last year of the first Five-Year Plan, and ensure greater development in the economic and cultural fields.

During the congress, Antonín Zápotocký, representative of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia and President of the Republic, attended the congress and delivered a congratulatory speech, which was warmly welcomed by all the delegates.

The congress also heard a report from Jožo Hojč on the work of the Party Central Control Commission.

After full and enthusiastic discussions on the above reports, the delegates to the congress adopted corresponding resolutions. Finally, the congress elected new members and alternate members of the Central Committee of the Slovak Communist Party and members of the Control Commission. The congress also adopted a congratulatory telegram to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia.

Furthermore, to celebrate the successful conclusion of the Tenth Congress of the Slovak Communist Party, 120,000 working people in Bratislava held a grand rally on the 15th.

    西罗基接着谈到了斯洛伐克工农业建设中所存在的问题和党的任务。他指出：党和工会必须保证充分均衡地在数量和质量上完成五年计划，实行最严格的节约；在政治上和经济上加强统一农业合作社，为进一步扩大合作运动创造条件；大力改善机器拖拉机站和国营农场的工作。
    最后，西罗基谈到了党的生活和发展。他强调说：今年是五年计划的最后一年。我们面临着复杂而艰巨的任务，但同时又面临着国家经济和文化进一步繁荣的前景。但是，由于党在建设社会主义的过程中已获得了丰富的经验，走着正确的道路。因此，我们有把握解决资产阶级政府所不能解决的问题，完成第一个五年计划最后一年的任务，保证经济和文化方面得到更大的发展。
    大会进行期间，捷克斯洛伐克共产党中央委员会代表、共和国总统安·萨波托斯基曾参加大会并致祝辞，受到全体代表的热烈欢迎。
