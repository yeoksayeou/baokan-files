Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, June 20th: Special Correspondent Wu Min reports: Marshal Kim Il-sung, Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army, and General Peng Dehuai, Commander of the Chinese People's Volunteers, in their letter to General Clark, Commander of the US Forces, reminded the world to pay attention to the extremely serious consequences caused by the US’s permissive attitude towards Rhee Syngman's sabotage of the prisoner-of-war agreement and the forced retention of more than 25,000 Korean prisoners of war. General Nam Il read Marshal Kim Il-sung's and General Peng Dehuai's letter at the plenary session held in Panmunjom today. Before reading the letter, General Nam Il said: The minutes of today's plenary session will be published.

Observers here point out that answering the serious questions raised in Marshal Kim Il-sung's and General Peng Dehuai's letter will be another decisive test of the US side's sincerity in the ceasefire and its credibility in abiding by the agreement. The serious questions are:

Can the United Nations Command control the South Korean government and army? If not, does the Korean ceasefire include the Rhee Syngman group? If it does not include the Rhee Syngman group, what guarantee is there for the implementation of the ceasefire agreement in South Korea?

The letter pointed out that if the Korean ceasefire includes the Rhee Syngman group, then the US must be responsible for immediately recovering all 25,952 prisoners of war forcibly detained by Rhee Syngman and ensuring that similar incidents never happen again.

Observers say that Clark's response to these serious questions will further determine the progress of the ceasefire negotiations. It will show whether the US military command will continue to adopt a permissive attitude towards Rhee Syngman's serious crime of sabotaging the prisoner-of-war agreement, thereby encouraging him to carry out new acts of sabotage, or whether it will take effective steps to recover all "released" prisoners of war and ensure that no further acts of sabotage occur.

After today's plenary session, there was no staff meeting or translator meeting. This is the second day that there has been no meeting on the administrative details of signing the ceasefire agreement. No date has been set for the next staff meeting or delegation meeting.

According to US sources, the number of prisoners of war forced to leave the POW camps is increasing. On June 18 (the first day of this serious incident), Clark Headquarters announced the number was 25,000. The next day, this number increased to 25,952. Today, another 45 people were forced to leave the POW camps.

Obviously, with the connivance of the US, this serious incident has become increasingly dangerous. Because the US military command has not taken responsible action, this has encouraged Rhee Syngman's conspiracy to obstruct the ceasefire at the last moment.

    美方如何答复我方提出的严重的问题
    将进一步决定停战谈判的进展
    【新华社开城二十日电】本社特派记者吴敏报道：朝鲜人民军最高司令官金日成元帅和中国人民志愿军司令员彭德怀将军在给美军司令克拉克的信里面，提醒全世界重视由于美国纵容李承晚破坏战俘协议、强迫扣留两万五千多名朝鲜战俘的默许态度而造成的极端严重的后果。金日成元帅和彭德怀将军的信是由南日大将今天在板门店举行的全体会议上宣读的，南日大将在宣读这封信之前曾说：今天的全体会议的议事记录将公开发表。
    这里的观察家指出：对金日成元帅和彭德怀将军的信中提出的严重的问题给予答复，将是对美方的停战诚意和遵守协定的信用的另一个具有决定意义的考验。严重的问题是：
    究竟联合国军司令部能否控制南朝鲜的政府和军队？如果不能，那么，朝鲜停战究竟包括不包括李承晚集团在内？如果不包括在内，则停战协定在南朝鲜方面的实施有什么保障？
    这封信指出：如果朝鲜停战包括李承晚集团在内，那么，美方就必须负责立即把李承晚强迫扣留的二万五千九百五十二名战俘全部追回，并保证以后绝对不再发生同类事件。
    观察家们说：克拉克对这些严重的问题的答复将进一步决定停战谈判的进展。它将说明美军司令部是要继续对李承晚破坏战俘协议的严重罪行采取纵容默许的态度，从而鼓励他进行新的破坏行动，还是要采取有效的步骤以追回一切“被释放”的战俘，并保证不再发生任何进一步破坏协定的行动。
    在今天的全体会议之后，没有举行参谋人员会议或翻译人员会议。这是第二天没有就签订停战协议的行政细节问题举行会议了。也没有规定举行下一次参谋人员会议或代表团大会的日期。
    从美方的消息看来，被迫离开战俘营的战俘的人数愈来愈多。六月十八日（这个严重事件发生的第一天），克拉克总部宣布人数是二万五千人。第二天这个人数增加到二万五千九百五十二人。今天又有四十五人被迫离开战俘营。
    显而易见，在美方纵容下，这个严重事件已经变得愈来愈危险。由于美军司令部没有采取负责的行动，这就鼓励了李承晚在最后的时刻阻挠停战的阴谋。
