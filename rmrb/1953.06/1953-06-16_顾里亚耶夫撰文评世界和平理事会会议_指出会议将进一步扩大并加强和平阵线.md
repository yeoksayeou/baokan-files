Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 15th. Gu Liayev, Secretary of the Secretariat of the World Peace Council, published an article in "Labor News" on the 14th, commenting on the World Peace Council meeting that opened in Budapest on the 15th. The article said that world public opinion is looking forward to this meeting with great interest, because the prestige of the World Peace Council—the leading force of the peace movement—has increased, and it has carried out many activities in the struggle to resolve international disputes. Since the closing of the World People's Peace Congress, the international situation has undergone important changes, which have created new and more favorable conditions for maintaining peace.

Gu Liayev emphasized that those who advocate the use of force as a means of resolving international disputes are trying to convince the people that war is inevitable and that the people are powerless to avoid war, but they have suffered serious failures. The people of the world have personally seen how powerful actions such as the hundreds of millions of signatures on the Stockholm Appeal demanding the banning of atomic weapons and the subsequent signature campaign for the declaration demanding a peace pact between the five major powers are. Recent developments in the international situation have told the people that they have the power to ease international tensions and to change future developments in favor of peace. The broad masses of the people have come to understand even more: if the people take on the cause of maintaining peace and maintain it to the end, peace can be maintained and consolidated.

Gu Liayev pointed out that the Soviet government's peace policy is an inspiring force, making honest people believe that lasting peace can certainly be won. The people of all countries have welcomed with great satisfaction the Soviet government's proposals for a speedy resolution of the Korean and German issues. Gu Liayev said that the most urgent task at present is to make the Korean armistice negotiations lead to the realization of an armistice in Korea. Undoubtedly, public support can have a great impact on the negotiations and the final resolution of the Korean issue. Peace-loving people also understand the importance of a speedy treaty with a unified and democratic Germany.

Gu Liayev said that since the World People's Peace Congress, the peace movement of the people of all countries has made considerable progress. The movement is more organized, and national and local committees in various countries have learned how to establish contact with various groups and individuals striving for peace to achieve concerted action. This World Peace Council meeting will make an extremely important contribution to further expanding and strengthening the powerful peace front. The World Peace Council, the leading center of all people striving for peace, has always pointed out the correct solutions to important international issues. Undoubtedly, this meeting will adopt resolutions to further strengthen the struggle for peace and friendship among the people of all countries.

    顾里亚耶夫撰文评世界和平理事会会议
    指出会议将进一步扩大并加强和平阵线
    【新华社十五日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：世界和平理事会书记处书记顾里亚耶夫十四日在“劳动报”发表文章，评论十五日在布达佩斯开幕的世界和平理事会会议。文章说，世界公众以极大兴趣期望着这次会议，因为世界和平理事会——这一和平运动的领导力量的威望增加了，它在争取解决国际争端的斗争中进行了不少活动。从世界人民和平大会闭幕以来，国际形势有了重要的变化，这已为维护和平创造了新的、更加有利的条件。
    顾里亚耶夫着重指出，鼓吹以武力作为解决国际争端的手段的人，企图叫人民相信战争是不可避免的，叫人民相信人民无力避免战争，但是他们已遭到严重的失败。全世界人民已经亲自看到，在要求禁止原子武器的斯德哥尔摩宣言上的数亿人的签名和后来的要求五大国缔结和平公约宣言签名运动这一类行动具有多么大的力量。最近国际形势的发展已经告诉人民，他们是有力量来缓和国际紧张局势，来改变未来的事态发展使其有利于和平的。广大的人民已经更加了解：假如人民把维护和平的事业担当起来，并把它维护到底，和平就能够维护和巩固。
    顾里亚耶夫指出，苏联政府的和平政策是一个鼓舞的力量，它使得正直的人民相信持久的和平是一定可以争取得来的。各国人民极为满意地欢迎苏联政府提出的关于迅速解决朝鲜和德国问题的建议。顾里亚耶夫说，目前最急要的任务是使朝鲜停战谈判导致朝鲜停战的实现。无疑的，公众的支持能对谈判和朝鲜问题的最后解决产生极大的影响。爱好和平的人民也了解到迅速与统一、民主的德国缔结和约的重要性。
    顾里亚耶夫说，从世界人民和平大会以来，各国人民的和平运动已经有了相当大的开展。运动更有组织了，各国全国性的和地方性的委员会已经学会应该怎样和各种争取和平的团体和个人建立联系，以取得一致的行动。这一次世界和平理事会会议对于进一步扩大并加强强大的和平阵线，将有极为重要的贡献。全体争取和平的人民的领导中心——世界和平理事会，一向对重要的国际问题指出正确的解决方法。无疑的，这次会议将通过进一步加强争取和平与各国人民友好的斗争的决议。
