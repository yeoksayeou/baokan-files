    The Pingliang Special Office of Gansu Province Should Examine the Work of Wang Zongyao and Others
    A letter from Ximuzawa, Jieshipu, Jingning County, Gansu Province: The Pingliang Special Office dispatched a production work group to work in the Fourth District of Jingning County. The leader of the work group was Wang Zongyao. The cadres of this group were indifferent to the production of the masses, spending most of their time sitting in the District People's Government office. When they occasionally came out, they would stroll around Jieshipu Street for fun. They did not seriously participate in meetings related to production work convened by the district. For example, once the district held a meeting of mutual aid team leaders for the entire district, Wang Zongyao called the district clerk Li Yujie and instructed, "Take good notes, organize the materials when you get back, and send them to me later!" He himself did not attend the meeting, but sat outside the venue sunning himself.
    The work group cadres had a very poor relationship with the local cadres and the masses. They often said in front of the cadres: "The masses here are really backward and have no production capacity at all." They also spoke ill of the cadres in front of the masses. This caused unrest in the work morale of the cadres, confusion in the thinking of the masses, and mutual resentment between cadres and the masses. The masses of Zhongcun Township, Jieshi Township, commented on the work group: "The production work group eats the people's steamed buns and does nothing all day long, swaggering around Jieshipu Street like bureaucrats." The Fourth District Chief once reported the opinions of the masses to Wang Zongyao, but Wang Zongyao ignored them.
    The current central task of the Fourth District is to lead the peasants in production for self-relief. Wang Zongyao did not care about the work of production for self-relief, but criticized the district and township cadres, saying: "There are conditions here to build water mills, why don't you lead the peasants to build water mills?" The peasants were very angry when they heard these words, and some said: "We don't have food or seeds right now; you don't think of ways to solve our problems, but you want us to build water mills!"
    I believe that the Pingliang Special Office should quickly examine the work of this production work group led by Wang Zongyao.

### 甘肃省平凉专署应该检查王宗尧等的工作

专栏：读者来信摘要

    甘肃省平凉专署应该检查王宗尧等的工作
    甘肃省静宁县界石铺西木泽来信：平凉专署派了一个生产工作组到静宁县第四区工作。工作组的组长是王宗尧。该组干部对群众的生产漠不关心，每天多半时间坐在区人民政府里。他们偶尔出来了，就跑到界石铺街上蹓着玩。区里召开有关生产工作的会议，他们也不认真参加。如有一次区里召开全区互助组长会议，王宗尧就把区文书李毓杰叫来，吩咐说：“把笔记记好，下去把材料整理好，回头给我送来！”他自己不去参加会议，却坐在会场外晒太阳。
    工作组干部和当地干部、群众的关系很不好，他们经常在干部面前说：“你们这里的群众真落后，没有一点生产能力。”在群众面前又说干部不好。这样闹得干部工作情绪不安，群众思想混乱，干部群众互相瞒怨。界石乡中村群众对工作组的意见是：“生产工作组吃上人民的蒸馍，一天到晚无事做，在界石铺街上大摇大摆耍官僚。”四区区长曾向王宗尧反映过群众的意见，而王宗尧却置之不理。
    四区目前的中心工作是领导农民生产自救。王宗尧不管生产自救工作，却批评区乡干部说：“这里有条件修水磨，你们为啥不领导农民修水磨呢？”农民们听了这些话很气愤，有的说：“我们当前没有吃的，没有种籽；你不给我们想办法解决，却叫我们修水磨！”
    我认为：平凉专署应该迅速检查王宗尧领导的这个生产工作组的工作。
