    Lake West Special District Takes Effective Measures to Prevent Pesticide Poisoning Incidents
    A letter from the Lake West Special District, Shandong Province: The "Reader's Letters Summary" column on May 4th published reader Yang Xixian's suggestion regarding "Local People's Governments should educate farmers to properly store toxic pesticides," which mentioned that incidents of farmers accidentally ingesting pesticides and being poisoned had occurred multiple times in Jinxiang and other counties in our district. In the past, our education of the masses in this area was insufficient, and we failed to explain the methods for preventing poisoning in detail when promoting toxic pesticides, which led to continuous incidents of human and animal poisoning this spring. From March to mid-April alone, seven poisoning incidents occurred in five counties in our district, namely Shanxian, Fucheng, Jinxiang, Jiaxiang, and Chengwu, with 134 people poisoned, of whom nine unfortunately died. These tragic incidents were mainly caused by our insufficient concern for the lives of the people.
    The above situation has aroused the high alert of the leading comrades of the Special District. Commissioner Shang Gedong convened a production work meeting (attended by relevant departments such as the local party committee, the Special District Office, the Special District Cooperative, and the Special District Technology Extension Institute), and made a special study of this, notifying all levels of the People's Government and cooperatives under its jurisdiction on April 8th to take the following measures to prevent the occurrence of pesticide poisoning incidents:
        (1) When cooperatives at all levels promote toxic pesticides, they must patiently explain to the masses the methods of use and placement.
        (2) Pesticides previously stored in the hands of farmers should be registered by the People's Government in collaboration with the cooperatives. (After registration, they will not be taken back during spring sowing, but will continue to be used for spring planting.) In the future, farmers who purchase and use toxic pesticides should be introduced by the Township People's Government and registered with the cooperative; and it is advocated that mutual aid teams or several households purchase together and collectively store and use them.
        (3) District and township cadres and grassroots cooperative cadres should go deep into farmers' households at any time during the sowing period to check the use of pesticides and explain the methods of use. If there is any pesticide left over after sowing, it can be recovered by the grassroots cooperative at the original price to avoid storage in the hands of the masses.
        (4) Strengthen anti-poisoning education, and pay attention to anti-poisoning work when using pesticides.

### 湖西专署采取有效措施防止发生农药中毒事件

    湖西专署采取有效措施防止发生农药中毒事件
    山东省湖西专署来信：五月四日“读者来信摘要”栏刊登读者杨希贤关于“各地人民政府应该教育农民妥善保管有毒农药”的建议，其中提到我区金乡等县多次发生农民误食农药而中毒的事件。我们过去在这方面对群众教育不够，在推销有毒农药时没能详细交代防毒办法，因而今春各地连续发生了人畜中毒事件。自从三月份到四月中旬，我区单县、复程、金乡、嘉祥、城武五县就发生中毒事件七起，中毒者一百三十四人，其中九人不幸身死。这种惨痛事件，主要是我们对人民群众的生命关心不够造成的。
    以上情况，已经引起专署领导同志的高度警惕。尚格东专员召开生产办公会（地委、专署、专区合作社、专署技术推广所等有关部门参加），对此专门作了研究，于四月八日通报所属各级人民政府及各级合作社，采取如下措施，防止发生农药中毒事件：
       （一）各级合作社推销有毒农药时，必须向群众耐心讲明使用和放置的办法。
       （二）过去存放在农民手中的农药，由人民政府协同合作社进行登记。（登记后在春播中不收回，仍用于春种）今后农民购用有毒农药，应由乡人民政府介绍，向合作社登记；并提倡互助组或数户伙买，集体保管、使用。
       （三）区乡干部和基层合作社干部，在播种时期要随时深入农户，检查农药的使用情况，讲解使用办法。售出的农药在播种后如有剩余，可由基层社原价收回，以免在群众手中存放。
       （四）加强防毒教育，使用农药时要注意防毒工作。
