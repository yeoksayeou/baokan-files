    [This report] With the development of the motherland's construction, the scale of the lumber industry in Northeast China is expanding and its output is rapidly increasing. In the Northeast forest region, dozens of lumber mills with new equipment have been built. These lumber mills can produce nearly 10,000 cubic meters of lumber per day, which can not only meet the needs of China's construction projects, but also, because the lumber mills are located in the forest region, raw logs can be processed into finished lumber on the spot and then transported to various places. Compared with transporting raw logs, this can save the country 25,000 railcars per year. During the Liberation War, workers in the lumber mills in Northeast China produced more than 16.5 million railway sleepers to repair railways in the newly liberated areas, which could be used to build more than 10,380 kilometers of railways. After the liberation of the whole country, the lumber industry in Northeast China replaced handicraft production with mechanical production, and production efficiency has increased several times over. In recent years, the lumber mills in Northeast China have produced more than 10 million cubic meters of lumber. Some of this lumber has been shipped to faraway Xinjiang, some to the construction sites of the Huai River project, some to the Tianlan Railway as sleepers, and some to Beijing to build our capital.
    In recent years, the workers in the lumber industry in Northeast China have displayed a high degree of initiative and creativity. They have created hundreds of advanced experiences. In 1952 alone, they created more than 170 advanced experiences, including "automatic rollers," "adhesive applicators," and "meter-based lumber measurement," all of which have been fully promoted. Zhang Qinggui, a worker at the Nancha Lumber Mill, created "meter-based lumber measurement," which can save 40,000 cubic meters of lumber every year. The lumber mills have continuously launched production competitions to ensure the completion and overfulfillment of state plans. In 1952, the lumber mills completed 118.3 percent of their annual tasks. Workers at the Dunhua, Mingyuegou, Mudanjiang, and Erdaohaozi lumber mills completed their annual tasks in ten months. On the basis of completing their tasks, all workers increased production and saved wealth worth 470,000 tons of grain for the country throughout the year.
    Due to the increased political awareness of the workers and the adoption of advanced production technologies, labor productivity has increased year by year and month by month. For example, taking the average output of production teams in 1948 as 100, it rose to 148 in 1949, 421 in 1950, and 562 in 1952. The production plan target for 1953 was increased by 24 percent compared to 1952. The lumber yield rate increased from 71 percent in 1949 to 83 percent in 1952. Due to the increase in the lumber yield rate, 240,000 cubic meters of lumber can be produced each year.
    The rapid development of the lumber industry in Northeast China is inseparable from the warm assistance of Soviet experts. In 1949, a batch of lumber in various lumber mills could not be transferred out in time. After a long period of wind, rain, and sun exposure, some of the lumber had cracked and some had become moldy. The factories adopted the Soviet Union's rational lumber storage experience introduced by Soviet experts, so that the stored lumber would not become moldy or rotten. With the help of Soviet experts, a large-scale lumber mill was built in mid-April this year on the south bank of the Songhua River in Jiamusi City. The lumber mill has added automated equipment. Automatic conveyors can drag the produced lumber all the way to the lumber selection factory. The lumber selection factory can automatically select lumber, and sawdust conveyors can blow sawdust out of the basement. This newest lumber mill points out the direction for the further development of China's lumber industry.
    China's planned economic construction has further encouraged the labor enthusiasm of all workers in the lumber industry in Northeast China. When discussing the state plan, 18 lumber mills raised the state plan target by 5.6 percent. Workers in various factories have also found many tricks, learned and promoted advanced experiences, especially advanced Soviet experiences, revised team covenants, signed contact contracts and collective contracts, and launched production competitions. In the competition, their slogans are: "Resolutely complete the task, and do not let any basic construction site in the motherland lack lumber; do not let a single piece of lumber that does not meet quality specifications be transported to the basic construction site."

    东北制材工业迅速发展
    【本报讯】随着祖国建设事业的发展，东北制材工业规模日益扩大，产量迅速提高。在东北林区里，已建设了数十个有新型装置的制材厂。这些制材厂每天能生产近一万立方公尺木材，不仅可以供应我国建设工程的需要，并且，由于制材厂在林区，原木可以就地制成成材，再运到各地去，比起运输原木来，每年可以给国家节省两万五千个车皮。在解放战争中，东北各制材厂职工为给新解放区修复铁路，生产了一千六百五十余万根枕木，这些枕木可供修筑长达一万零三千八百多公里的铁路。全国解放后，东北制材工业以机械生产代替了手工业式的生产，生产效率成倍地提高了。这几年，东北各制材厂共生产了一千余万立方公尺木材。这批木材有的运到遥远的新疆；有的运到修治淮河的工地上；有的运到天兰铁路作枕木；有的运到北京建设我们的首都。
    几年来，东北的制材工业的职工发挥了高度的积极性和创造性，他们曾创造了数百种先进经验，仅一九五二年一年内，他们所创造的先进经验就有一百七十余种，其中“自动磙子”、“贴比器”、“公尺量材”等先进经验都已全面推广。南岔制材厂工人张清贵创造的“公尺量材”，每年可以节省四万立方公尺木材。各制材厂接连不断地开展了生产竞赛，以保证完成和超额完成国家计划。一九五二年各制材厂完成了全年任务的百分之一百十八点三。敦化、明月沟、牡丹江、二道河子等制材厂职工十个月工夫就完成了全年任务。在完成任务的基础上，全体职工全年又给国家增产和节约了价值四十七万吨粮食的财富。
    由于职工政治觉悟的提高，由于采用先进的生产技术，劳动生产率逐年逐月地提高了。如以一九四八年生产小组的平均产量为一百，一九四九年就上升为一百四十八，一九五○年为四百二十一，一九五二年为五百六十二。而一九五三年的产量计划指标比一九五二年又提高了百分之二十四。木材出材率则由一九四九年的百分之七十一提高到一九五二年的百分之八十三。由于出材率的提高，每年能多生产二十四万立方公尺木材。
    东北制材工业的迅速发展是与苏联专家的热诚帮助分不开的。一九四九年，各制材厂有一批木材未能及时调拨出去。这些木材经过长时间的风吹、雨淋、日晒，有的已经裂纹，有的已经生霉。各厂采纳了苏联专家介绍的苏联的合理积材经验，使积存的木材不会生霉腐朽。在苏联专家的帮助下，今年四月中旬，在佳木斯市松花江南岸，又建立了一座规模宏大的制材厂。这座制材厂添置了自动化的设备，自动传带可以把生产出的成材一直拖到选材厂，选材厂能自动选材，锯沫输送机能把锯沫从地下室里吹送出去。这个最新式的制材厂，给我国制材工业指出了进一步发展的方向。
    我国开始进行有计划的经济建设，更加鼓舞了东北制材工业全体职工的劳动热忱。各制材厂职工在讨论国家计划时，有十八个厂把国家计划指标提高了百分之五点六。各厂职工又找到很多窍门，学习和推广先进经验，特别是苏联的先进经验，修订了小组公约，签订了联系合同和集体合同，展开了生产竞赛。在竞赛中，他们的口号是：“坚决完成任务，不让祖国各个基本建设工地缺少木材；不让一根不合质量规格的木材运到基本建设工地去。”
