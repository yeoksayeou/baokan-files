Thirty-five trolleybuses and thirteen buses dedicated to children, filled with laughing children, drove through the bustling streets of the capital, taking them to various scenic spots.

The weather was clear this morning. In every park, there were Young Pioneers wearing red scarves and children wearing beautiful new clothes strolling around. Their joyful songs echoed from the calm lake surface and the green trees.

In various scenic spots, there were also children's picture reading stations for children to read. In the Working People's Cultural Palace, Beihai Park, and Zhongshan Park, many pictures related to children's lives have been on display since yesterday. These exhibitions will continue for ten days.
