Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, June 25th: According to TASS, the working people of the German Democratic Republic believe that the fascist provocations launched by foreign employers in Berlin are an attack on their vital interests and the interests of all German patriots who are fighting for peace and German unity. The working people held rallies throughout the country, expressing their trust and loyalty to the Republic's government and the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party.

On the 23rd, workers from many large factories in the democratic districts of Berlin held large-scale rallies. Walter Ulbricht, Vice-Premier of the German Democratic Republic and General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of German, spoke at a workers' rally at the "October 7th Machine Manufacturing Plant." He explained the recent measures taken by the government of the German Democratic Republic and the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of German to further improve the material living conditions of the working people. He emphasized the need to listen to the opinions of the workers and strengthen the ties between the Party and the working masses. He called on everyone to work together to accelerate the implementation of the resolutions of the Party Central Committee. Twenty-eight people spoke during the discussion, expressing their warm support for the government's measures and criticizing the serious shortcomings in the work of government agencies, trade union committees, and other group organs.

Otto Grotewohl, Premier of the German Democratic Republic and Chairman of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, delivered a speech at a rally of three thousand workers at a transformer manufacturing factory in the Köpenick district. Grotewohl spoke about the recent events in Berlin, exposed the West Berlin agitators who attempted to incite workers to riot, and pointed out the methods for implementing the decisions passed by the Party Central Committee.

The workers unanimously passed a resolution condemning the actions of the West Berlin agitators and expressed their full confidence in the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany and the government.

Large-scale rallies were also held in large factories in other cities of the German Democratic Republic.

At rallies held in various industrial sectors in Leipzig and the Leipzig district, participants unanimously condemned the fascist provocations and pledged to support the decisions of the Party and the government.

Railway workers in the Magdeburg district passed a resolution at their rally guaranteeing support for the government of the German Democratic Republic.

The overwhelming majority of farmers also welcomed and supported the government's decisions.
