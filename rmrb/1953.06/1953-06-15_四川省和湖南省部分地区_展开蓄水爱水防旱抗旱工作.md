    Sichuan Province and some areas of Hunan Province are launching summer water storage, water conservation, drought prevention, and drought resistance work. Party and government leading bodies at all levels in these areas are vigorously educating farmers on the ideas of "Man can conquer nature" and "Long-term drought resistance," reversing the farmers' apathetic and lax attitude towards drought prevention and drought resistance. In Wenjiang, Luzhou, Yibin, Wanxian, Nanchong and other special districts of Sichuan Province, farmers are actively repairing ponds, weirs, ditches, canals, and tools such as waterwheels and treadmills. Baolin Township in Qionglai County has repaired 39 leaking ponds and 17 leaking weirs, and repaired 10 treadmill piers for water storage and drought prevention. In Jiajiang County, the larger water conservancy project, Longtou Weir, has established five management stations to promote economical water use methods such as frequent watering, rotational watering, and shallow watering, providing sufficient water for more than 4,000 mu of previously water-deficient fields. In the areas of Dazhou Special District, such as Xuanhan and Wanyuan Counties, which are experiencing drought, the drought situation has basically improved after rushing to build river weirs and waterwheels to irrigate the fields. In Xin’guan Township, Shimen County, Hunan Province, an inspection of 132 ponds revealed that only 37 were filled with water. Farmers then seized the opportunity to store water after rain and use waterwheels to draw water, and now the number of ponds filled with water has increased to 116, and the remaining 16 ponds are also being filled.

    四川省和湖南省部分地区
    展开蓄水爱水防旱抗旱工作
    四川省和湖南省部分地区正在展开夏季蓄水爱水、防旱抗旱工作。这些地区各级党、政领导机关，都大力向农民进行“人定胜天”、“长期抗旱”的教育，扭转了农民对防旱抗旱的麻痹松懈情绪。四川省温江、泸州、宜宾、万县、南充等专区，农民正积极检修塘、堰、沟、渠和水车、筒车等工具。邛崃县宝林乡已修补好三十九口漏塘和十七道漏堰，修好筒车墩十处，蓄水防旱。夹江县较大的水利工程龙头堰成立五个管理站，推广勤浇、轮浇、浅浇等经济用水的方法，使原来缺水的四千多亩田有了充足的用水。达县专区宣汉、万源等县呈现旱象的地区，经过抢筑河堰和车水灌田，旱情已基本好转。湖南省石门县新官乡一百三十二口塘，经检查发现，灌满水的只有三十七口塘；于是农民们抓紧雨后蓄水和车水，现在灌满水的已增加到一百十六口塘，其余十六口塘也正在灌水中。 （新华社）
