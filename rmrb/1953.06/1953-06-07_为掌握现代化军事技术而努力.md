    Strive to Master Modern Military Technology
    A Short Comment
    The Chinese People's Army is marching towards regularization and modernization. In order to accelerate the process of regularization and modernization to defend our motherland and safeguard peace in the Far East and the world, the urgent task of all servicemen is to learn from the great Soviet army, to learn from the advanced military experience of the Soviet army, and especially to learn from the advanced military technology of the Soviet army.
    As everyone knows, the soldiers of our People's Army have a high degree of political consciousness and therefore have always possessed inherent bravery, which is extremely valuable. However, the experience of the Soviet army in defeating the fascist aggressors in the Second World War and the experience of the Chinese People's Volunteers in fighting against the American aggressors teach us that to defeat a powerful enemy armed to the teeth, it is not enough to rely solely on courage and political consciousness; we must further master modern military technology.
    Comrade Stalin repeatedly taught the Soviet army that it must steadfastly study modern military science and master combat skills. Comrade Stalin criticized those who were merely satisfied with courage, saying: "Many of us are always boasting of their courage. But if they are not proficient in combat techniques, relying solely on courage is useless. Courage alone, hatred of the enemy alone, is not enough. Everyone knows that the American Indians are very brave, but they are powerless when they use their bows and arrows against the white people armed with guns." (See Yakolev, "On a Great and Simple Man.") Therefore, in his order of May 1, 1942, Comrade Stalin demanded that the soldiers of all branches of the Soviet army "master their weapons and become skilled craftsmen in their profession," and the order also stated: Only in this way can they "learn to shoot the enemy with a hundred shots," "learn the art of defeating the enemy." Commander-in-Chief Zhu, in his book "On the Liberated Area Battlefield," also taught us when discussing the issue of training troops: "In the past, there was a tendency in our army to disrespect physical strength and technology, as if it were enough for the army to have political consciousness. This is very wrong. In the past, didn't we also win battles? Yes, we won battles in the past, but winning battles does not mean that our technology is already good enough. If we have political consciousness, plus good physical strength and good technology, we can win even greater victories with fewer casualties." Facts have also proven that only by mastering technology and being proficient in the weapons in hand can we exert the maximum power of the weapons and fatally strike the enemy. In the past revolutionary wars, especially in the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, the Chinese People's Army has indeed produced many heroic figures who possessed both courage and mastered combat skills. They created brilliant achievements, greatly enhanced the power of our army, and severely struck the enemy. Among the representatives of the Chinese People's Volunteers who returned to participate in the "May 1st" celebrations not long ago, there were many such heroic figures. For example, Huang Jiafu, a demolition expert of the Volunteers, bravely and ingeniously completed fifteen demolition missions in a row in the battle against the enemy west of Guandal里, annihilating more than 200 enemies. Ma Xinnian, a soldier of the Volunteers, killed or wounded more than 80 enemies with grenades and hand mines in the battle to defend a certain position on Shangganling for five days and four nights; Liu Si, an anti-aircraft gunner of the Volunteers, shot down or damaged 28 enemy planes on an anti-aircraft artillery position guarding an important bridge in a certain area. In the cold-blooded killing of enemies movement on the Korean front, excellent snipers continued to emerge. For example, Zhang Taofang, a young sniper who recently appeared in the Volunteer positions on the Shangganling front, is an example of constantly mastering and improving military technology in the cold-blooded killing of enemies movement. Therefore, he was able to kill or wound 211 enemies who were trying to escape death by various means with 437 bullets in 31 days, including 55 bullets to eliminate 51 enemies in five days from April 8 to 12. Because they mastered excellent shooting techniques, they made the enemy afraid to show their faces, so the heroic words "Don't let the enemy lift their heads" resounded on many of our army's positions. The brilliant battle examples created by these heroic figures are worth learning by all servicemen. All servicemen should constantly improve their combat skills, shoot the enemy with a hundred shots, and learn the art of defeating the enemy.
    Modern military technology is a complex science, and to learn and master it, one cannot rely solely on existing experience and a little existing cultural and scientific knowledge. Comrade Stalin once taught us: "Especially in national defense, it is even more impermissible to use one's working-class or peasant origin to explain one's lack of education, one's lack of technical preparation, rudeness, or insensitivity. Because the enemy will never yield to us because of our social origin. Precisely because we are workers and peasants, we should be thoroughly prepared in all matters, no less than the enemy." (See Yakolev, "On a Great and Simple Man.") Therefore, all servicemen must deeply recognize that cultural and scientific knowledge is the key to mastering modern military technology, and they must constantly improve their cultural and scientific level in order to constantly improve their military technology. The cultural learning movement of the People's Army for more than a year has fully proven how important it is to improve culture for mastering modern military technology. Pan Huiwen, a soldier in a certain unit, was an illiterate feeder a year ago, but after cultural learning, he is now the deputy squad leader of an artillery squad operating modern artillery. Li Fujian, an engineer soldier in a certain unit, was worried half a year ago that he could not use road-building machines and could not serve the construction of the motherland better. After half a year of hard study, he is now skillfully driving a bulldozer to open up roads. Such examples can be said to be emerging every day in the People's Army now. But we should not be satisfied with the current achievements, because this is far from fully adapting to the needs of building a modern national defense army. Therefore, every revolutionary soldier must strive to consolidate the results of past cultural learning, and continue to adhere to cultural learning during the regular training period of the troops in the future, and continue to improve the level of cultural and scientific knowledge, so as to create more favorable conditions for further mastering and improving military technology.
    To build a strong, regularized and modernized national defense army is one of our current urgent tasks. Let us work harder and more tenaciously to learn and improve modern military technology.

    为掌握现代化军事技术而努力
    微言
    中国人民军队正在向正规化现代化建设的道路迈进。为了加速正规化现代化的过程以保卫我们祖国和保卫远东与世界和平，全体军人的迫切任务，就是向伟大的苏联军队学习，学习苏联军队的先进军事经验，特别要学习苏联军队的先进军事技术。
    人所共知，我国人民军队的战士，具有高度的政治觉悟，因而一向具有勇敢的本色，这是极其可贵的。但是，苏联军队在第二次世界大战中打败法西斯侵略者的经验和中国人民志愿军对美国侵略者作战的经验教导我们，要战胜武装到牙齿的强大敌人，绝不能单凭勇敢和政治觉悟，还必须进一步掌握现代军事技术。
    斯大林同志曾一再教导苏联军队必须坚韧地学习现代军事科学，掌握战斗技术。斯大林同志曾对那些仅仅满足于勇敢精神的人作过批评，他说：“我们有很多人总是夸耀自己的勇气。可是若不精通战斗技术，而只依胆量是毫无用处的。只是勇敢，只是仇恨敌人，是不够的。谁都知道：美洲的印第安人是很勇敢的，可是他们用自己的弓箭来反对以枪械武装起来的白种人，是无能为力的。”（见雅可福列夫著：“论伟大而质朴的人物”一文。）因此，斯大林同志在一九四二年五月一日的命令中要求苏联军队各兵种的战士们要“精通自己的武器，成为熟悉本行技艺的匠师，”命令中还说：只有这样才能“学会百发百中射击敌人”，“才能学会战胜敌人的艺术。”朱总司令在“论解放区战场”一书中谈到练兵的问题时也曾教导我们：“过去我们军队中，有不尊重体力与技术的倾向，似乎以为军队只要有了政治觉悟就够了。这是很错误的。过去，我们不是也打了胜仗么？不错，过去也打了胜仗，但打了胜仗不是说我们的技术已经好了，已经够了。我们有了政治觉悟，再加上体力好、技术好，就可以打更大的胜仗，更少伤亡。”事实也证明：只有掌握了技术，精通了手中的武器，才能发挥武器的最大威力，致命地打击敌人。中国人民军队在历次革命战争中，特别是中国人民志愿军在抗美援朝的战争中，的确出现了不少既具有勇敢精神又掌握了战斗技术的英雄人物，他们创造了光辉的战绩，大大提高了我军的威力，严重地打击了敌人。不久以前归国参加“五一”节观礼的中国人民志愿军代表中就有不少这样的英雄人物。例如志愿军爆破手黄家富，在官岱里以西反击敌人的战斗中，一个人勇敢、机智地连续完成十五次爆破任务，歼灭敌人二百多名。志愿军战士马新年在上甘岭坚守某阵地五天四夜的战斗中用手榴弹和手雷杀伤了八十多个敌人；志愿军高射炮手刘四在保卫某地一个重要桥梁的高射炮阵地上击落击伤敌机二十八架。在朝鲜前线的冷枪杀敌运动中，优秀的狙击手更是不断涌现。例如最近在上甘岭前线的志愿军阵地上出现的青年狙击手张桃芳，就是在冷枪杀敌运动中不断掌握和提高军事技术的范例。因此，他才能在三十一天中，用四百三十七发子弹打死打伤企图用各种办法逃避死亡的二百一十一名敌人，其中从四月八日到十二日的五天中曾用五十五发子弹，消灭了五十一个敌人。由于他们掌握了优等的射击技术，打得敌人不敢露面，所以在我军很多阵地上响着“不让敌人抬起头来”的豪语。这些英雄人物创造的光辉战例是值得全体军人学习的。全体军人都应不断地提高自己的战斗技术，百发百中地射击敌人，学会战胜敌人的艺术。
    现代军事技术是一门复杂的科学，要学习和掌握它，就不能单凭已有的经验和已有的一点文化科学知识。斯大林同志曾经教导我们：“特别在国防事业中更不允许拿工农出身来解释自己教育程度的不足，来解释自己没有技术准备、粗鲁或不通事理。因为敌人绝不会因我们的社会出身而向我们让步。正因为我们是工农，我们更应当在一切问题上都有周详完备的准备，毫不亚于敌人才对。”（见雅可福列夫著：“论伟大而质朴的人物”一文。）因此，全体军人必须深切认识，文化科学知识是掌握现代军事技术的锁钥，必须不断提高自己的文化科学水平，才能不断提高自己的军事技术。人民军队一年多来的文化学习运动已经充分证明，提高文化对于掌握现代军事技术的作用该是多么重大。某部战士潘惠文，一年以前还是一个不识字的饲养员，可是经过文化学习以后，现在已经成为一个操纵着现代化大炮的炮兵班副班长了。某部工兵战士李孚俭，半年以前还在苦恼着自己不会使用筑路机器不能为祖国建设更好地服务，经过他的半年苦学以后，已经熟练地驾驶着推土机在开辟公路了。这样的事例在人民军队中现在可以说是每日每时地在涌现。但我们不应该满足于现在的成就，因为这还远不能完全适应建设现代化国防军的需要。因此，每一个革命战士都必须努力巩固以往文化学习的成果，并在今后部队经常的正规训练时期，继续坚持文化学习，继续提高文化和科学知识的水平，为进一步掌握和提高军事技术造成更加有利的条件。
    为建设一支强大的正规化、现代化的国防军而奋斗，是我们当前的迫切任务之一。让我们更加奋勉和更加顽强地学习和提高现代军事技术而努力吧。
