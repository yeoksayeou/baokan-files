Xinhua News Agency, Paris, June 27th: After the French government crisis lasted for thirty-seven days, big capitalist Joseph Laniel requested authorization from the National Assembly on the 26th to form a "new" government. Laniel is the second person after Pinay to conduct cabinet formation activities based on the "minimum program" jointly drafted by leaders of various right-wing parties. The National Assembly, which had previously rejected authorization for four prime ministerial candidates, including Reynaud, accepted his request this time.

Laniel is a big boss of textile factories and a landlord, belonging to the "Independent Republican Party" like Reynaud and Pinay. He once served as Deputy Minister of Finance under "French Surrender Premier" Reynaud. After the liberation of France, he served as Minister of Post and Telecommunications and Minister of State. He has always been a relatively inconspicuous figure on the political stage. United Press International said that it was precisely for this reason that he was accepted by the various right-wing parties in the parliament.

On the 26th, Laniel delivered a policy speech in the National Assembly. This speech showed that he was no different from his predecessors. He said that the French government should continue to be loyal to the North Atlantic Alliance and would propose at the upcoming Bermuda Conference that France could not solely shoulder the burden of the Indochina war of aggression. Regarding the Four-Power Conference, he said that his government was prepared to negotiate with those who "produce concrete evidence to prove their goodwill." He was prepared to ask the parliament to approve the "European Army" treaty and the "European Political Community" plan. He demanded the imposition of new taxes, demanded "privileges," and demanded "the most rapid and thorough revision of the constitution possible."

During the debate, Communist Party member Pierre Villon pointed out that Laniel was an "out-and-out reactionary capitalist" and advocated refusing to approve him as Prime Minister. As a result of the vote, Laniel obtained the right to form a cabinet with 398 votes in favor, but there were 206 votes against.

    法国反动资本家拉尼埃组阁
    宣布继续效忠北大西洋侵略集团
    【新华社二十七日讯】巴黎消息：在法国政府危机延续了三十七天之后，大资本家约瑟夫·拉尼埃于二十六日要求国民议会授权他出来组织“新”政府。拉尼埃是继比内之后根据各右翼政党领袖共同拟订的“最低纲领”进行组阁活动的第二个人。曾经拒绝授权雷诺等四个总理候选人的国民议会，这次接受了他的请求。
    拉尼埃是纺织工厂的大老板兼地主，和雷诺、比内同属“独立共和党”。他曾经做过“法国投降总理”雷诺的财政部副部长；法国解放后，又做过邮电部长和国务部长。在政治舞台上，他一向是不大露面的脚色。合众社说：正是因为这样，他才被议会中各右翼政党接受。
    二十六日，拉尼埃在国民议会发表政策演说。这篇演说表明：他和他的前任并没有什么不同。他说，法国政府要继续忠于北大西洋联盟，并将在快要举行的百慕大会议上提出法国不能单独挑起印度支那侵略战争的重担。关于四国会议，他说，他的政府准备和“拿出具体证据来证明其善意”的人进行谈判。他准备要求议会批准“欧洲军”条约和“欧洲政治集团”计划。他要求征收新税，要求“特权”，并且要求“尽可能迅速、彻底地修改宪法”。
    在辩论中，共产党议员皮埃尔·维戎指出拉尼埃是个“反动透顶的资本家”，主张拒绝批准他做总理。表决结果，拉尼埃因有三百九十八票的赞成而获得了组阁权，但有二百零六票反对。
