    Xinhua News Agency report: A large amount of wheat has been put on the market in various places, and the national procurement plan for May has been overfulfilled. The wheat-marketing regions include: Sichuan, Yunnan, and Xikang in the Southwest region; Zhejiang, Fujian, Anhui, and Jiangsu in the East China region; Jiangxi, Guangdong, Guangxi, Hunan, and Hubei in the Central South region; and parts of Hebei, Henan, Shandong, and Shanxi provinces, which are major wheat-producing regions in our country.
    Although the amount of wheat produced in the provinces of the Yangtze River Basin and south of the Yangtze River is not large, because they are rice-producing areas, farmers sell wheat as a commercial grain. Therefore, after wheat was put on the market successively in various places, state-owned grain companies and cooperatives began to purchase it in the primary market one after another. The amount of wheat put on the market in the above-mentioned areas generally increased in May, and the national procurement plan for May has been overfulfilled, with East China completing 131.94 percent. The wheat harvest in Southwest China was good this year, and farmers actively sold wheat to the state. Since the wheat along the Yangtze River in Sichuan was put on the market successively in late May, procurement work has been carried out intensively in various places. State-owned grain companies and cooperatives have set up more than 100 purchasing points in each special district, making it very convenient for farmers to sell grain. The province can collect millions of catties of grain every day. The wheat purchased by the state generally accounts for about 80 percent of the amount on the market. Farmers in Guizhou Province have a large surplus of grain to sell, and in Zunyi, Anshun, and other special districts of the province, much of the wheat sold by farmers is last year's old grain. The Grain Bureau of the Yunnan Provincial People's Government has also sent four groups of cadres to the procurement areas to assist in the procurement work. Zhejiang Province in East China has had a bumper wheat harvest this year. In addition to the local state-owned grain companies, 1,800 grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives are purchasing on behalf of the state. In Anhui Province's Wuhu, Anqing, Liu'an, Chuxian special districts and Jiangsu Province's Jiangning, Liyang, Luhe, Tongbei, Yizheng, Jiangdu and other 16 counties, a large amount of wheat and barley is put on the market every day; the quality of wheat and barley on the market in Anhui Province is very good, with very little moisture and impurities, and most of them can meet the standards stipulated by the state-owned grain companies, and state-owned grain companies and supply and marketing cooperatives are starting to purchase in large quantities. Rural supply and marketing cooperatives have added many purchasing points in various places, with 158 purchasing points in Wuhu Special District of Anhui Province alone. The grain and cooperative departments of Jiangning, Gaochun, Taicang and other counties in Jiangsu Province have also supplied the purchased barley and Yuan wheat to the farmers in Huaiyin and other regions. Wheat procurement work in the Central South region is also underway. In the procurement, prices are set according to grade, and the state's price policy is implemented, which is welcomed by farmers.
    New wheat has been put on the market in parts of Hebei, Henan, Shandong, Shanxi and other major wheat-producing provinces in our country. In Hebei Province's Handan Special District, wheat-producing areas such as Cixian County and Daming County, new wheat began to be put on the market successively in late May. In the southern part of Henan Province, new wheat is gradually being put on the market. Currently, the daily amount of new wheat on the market in Xinyang Special District reaches more than 80,000 catties. There is also a lot of new wheat on the market every day in Nanyang and Shangqiu Special Districts. In the Lunan area of Shandong Province, new wheat will be put on the market in large quantities in mid-June, and only wheat from Yixian County, Heze County and other counties is currently on the market. In the Yuncheng Special District of Shanxi Province, wheat is being harvested in Ruicheng, Yishi, Anyi, Pinglu, Yongji, Yuxiang and other places. After the new wheat was put on the market successively, wheat prices began to fall. In Xinjiang, Fenyang and other places in Shanxi Province, grain prices fell by about 200 yuan per catty. In some areas in the southern part of Shanxi Province, although they suffered varying degrees of hail disasters this year, after rescue, the yield per mu generally reached about 80 catties.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 3rd] Shaanxi Province, one of the major wheat-producing areas in our country, has had a bumper wheat harvest this year. According to comrades from the leading organs of some special districts in the wheat-producing areas of Shaanxi Province who told reporters on the phone: the one million mu of wheat in Nanzheng Special District in the south has achieved a bumper harvest unprecedented in recent years, with an average yield of 180 catties per mu. In Baoji Special District's Fengxiang, Qishan and other eight counties (cities) in the Guanzhong area, the average wheat harvest is about 180 catties per mu, an increase of 15% compared with last year. In Weinan Special District's Huaxian, Huayin, Baishui and other ten counties, the average wheat harvest is 169 catties per mu, an increase of 30% compared with last year. The yield of "Bima No. 1" and "6028" improved wheat varieties in the nearly three million mu of improved variety demonstration areas is even higher, with "Bima No. 1" wheat averaging about 300 catties per mu. The reporter learned from visits along the Longhai Railway: The Leizhiping mutual aid group in Chelei Village, Weinan County, can harvest an average of 390 catties per mu from more than 50 mu of wheat fields; the Shen Shengquan mutual aid group in Mao Liu Village, Xianyang County, can harvest an average of more than 400 catties per mu from eight mu of wheat fields. Both of these mutual aid groups are better mutual aid groups in the local area. The province has more than 23 million mu of wheat fields this year, an increase of 4.5% over last year, therefore, this year's total wheat output will greatly exceed last year.
    Currently, the wheat in Nanzheng Special District in southern Shaanxi Province has been harvested, and the new wheat is about to be put on the market. The wheat in the Guanzhong area has also begun to be harvested, and it is expected to be harvested by mid-June.
    The reason for the widespread bumper wheat harvest in Shaanxi Province this year is that, in addition to timely rainfall, the main reason is that the leading organs at all levels vigorously led farmers to improve farming techniques and overcome natural disasters and insect pests. Governments at all levels in the Guanzhong area mobilized more than 100,000 farmers to promptly capture and destroy wheat-sucking bugs, ensuring a bumper wheat harvest.

    长江流域和长江以南各省产麦数量虽然不大，但因都是产米地区，农民把小麦作为商品粮出售。所以，各地小麦陆续上市后，国营粮食公司和合作社即在初级市场上先后开始收购。五月份上述地区上市量普遍增加，五月份全国收购计划已超额完成，华东区完成了百分之一百三十一点九四。今年西南各地小麦收成较好，农民积极把小麦卖给国家。四川沿长江两岸的小麦自五月下旬陆续上市后，各地收购工作紧张进行。国营粮食公司和合作社在每个专区都设有一百多个收购点，农民售粮非常方便。全省每天可收粮数百万斤。国家收购的小麦一般占上市量百分之八十左右。贵州省农民有大批余粮需要出售，该省遵义、安顺等专区，许多农民出售的小麦都是去年的陈粮。云南省人民政府粮食局也先后派出四批干部到收购地区协助收购工作。华东区浙江省今年小麦获得了丰收。除当地国营粮食公司收购外，还有一千八百个基层供销合作社代国家收购。安徽省的芜湖、安庆、六安、滁县等专区和江苏省的江宁、溧阳、六合、铜北、仪徵、江都等十六个县每天有大批的小麦、大麦上市；安徽省上市的小麦、大麦的质量很好，所含水分和杂质极少，大部分都能达到国营粮食公司规定的标准，国营粮食公司和供销合作社正开始大量收购。农村供销合作社已在各地增设了很多收购点，仅安徽省芜湖专区就有一百五十八个收购点。江苏省的江宁、高淳、太仓等县粮食、合作部门并把已收购到的大麦和元麦，供应淮阴等地区农民的需要。中南区的小麦收购工作也正在进行。各地在收购中，实行分等论价，贯彻国家的价格政策，受到农民的欢迎。
    我国主要产麦区河北、河南、山东、山西等省部分地区，新麦已经上市。河北省邯郸专区磁县、大名等产麦区，自五月下旬新麦就开始先后上市了。河南省南部地区，新小麦正逐渐上市。信阳专区目前每日新小麦上市量达八万多斤。南阳、商邱专区每日上市的新小麦也不少。山东省鲁南地区新麦将于六月中旬大量上市，现上市的只有峄县、菏泽等县的小麦。山西省运城专区芮城、猗氏、安邑、平陆、永济、虞乡等地的小麦正在收割。新麦陆续上市后，麦价开始回落。山西省新绛、汾阳等地，粮价每斤回落二百元上下。山西省南部部分地区，今年虽遭受了轻重不同的雹灾，但经过抢救后，每亩收成一般也达八十斤左右。
    【新华社西安三日电】我国主要产麦区之一的陕西省，今年小麦普遍丰收。据陕西省产麦地区的一些专区领导机关的同志在电话中告诉记者说：南部南郑专区一百多万亩小麦，获得了近几年来未有的大丰收，每亩平均产量可达一百八十斤。关中地区宝鸡专区凤翔、岐山等八县（市），平均每亩小麦可收获一百八十斤左右，比去年增产一成半。渭南专区华县、华阴、白水等十县，平均每亩小麦可收获一百六十九斤，比去年增产三成。各地良种推广区近三百万亩。“碧蚂一号”、“六零二八号”良种小麦产量更高，其中“碧蚂一号”小麦每亩平均产量达到三百斤左右。记者在陇海铁路沿线地区访问了解：渭南县车雷村雷志平互助组五十多亩麦田，平均每亩可收三百九十斤；咸阳县帽刘村沈生权互助组八亩麦田，平均每亩可收四百多斤。这两个互助组都是当地较好的互助组。全省今年有二千三百多万亩麦田，较去年增加百分之四点五，因此，今年小麦总产量将大大超过去年。
    目前，陕西省南部南郑专区的小麦已收割完毕，新麦即将上市。关中地区的小麦也已开镰收割，预计到六月中旬就可收割完毕。
    今年陕西省小麦普遍丰收的原因，除雨水适时外，主要是各地领导机关大力领导农民改进了耕作技术，战胜了天灾和虫害。关中地区各级人民政府曾动员十多万农民，及时捕灭了小麦吸浆虫，保证了麦子的丰收。
