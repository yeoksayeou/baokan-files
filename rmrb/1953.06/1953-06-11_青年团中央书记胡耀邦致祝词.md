    Hu Yaobang, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League, delivered a congratulatory speech at the Second National Congress of the All-China Youth Federation, congratulating the success of the congress.

    Hu Yaobang said: Chinese youth have a glorious tradition of patriotism. Under the teachings of Chairman Mao and the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, Chinese youth actively participated in the revolutionary struggles against imperialist aggression and domestic reactionaries. After the founding of the People's Republic of China, Chinese youth actively participated in the Resist-America, Aid-Korea Movement, various social reform movements, and production movements. In this new historical period, Chinese youth will contribute even more to the country in various construction work posts. This is a new task given to the youth by the motherland, and it is also the greatest trust and expectation for the younger generation. Chinese youth will never fail this trust and expectation.

    Now our motherland is beginning planned construction. In the construction cause of the motherland, economic construction is the long-term central task of the people of the whole country, and the center of economic construction is industrial construction. All our work must be subordinate to this central task, subordinate to the requirements of developing industry; however, our construction work in all aspects is an indispensable part of the entire national construction cause. Any department must rely on the cooperation and mutual support of various aspects of work. The motherland requires youth to adhere to and cherish their work posts. We must realize that all work that is beneficial to the people is the work that the motherland requires us to undertake, and all undertakings related to the national construction cause are the undertakings that the motherland needs. Therefore, our task is to engage in creative labor diligently, wholeheartedly, and vigorously in our own work posts, and strive to obtain positive labor results, so as to win victory and add glory to the great cause of building the motherland.

    However, the construction cause is complex and arduous, which not only requires youth to have labor enthusiasm, but also requires rich labor knowledge and experience. This requires learning, persistently and tirelessly learning, especially learning in practical work, so that they can become people who are good at labor. The motherland's requirements for youth in construction are to study culture, science, and technology hard, study revolutionary theory, improve political awareness, learn from the glorious example of Soviet youth, learn from Soviet advanced science and advanced experience, so that they can labor intelligently for the construction of the motherland, overcome difficulties, and consciously connect their daily and hourly labor with the socialist future of the great motherland, and with the more happy and beautiful future of the younger generation. This responsibility is the great happiness and glory of Chinese youth.

    The construction cause of our country is a truly great cause. The purpose we want to achieve in this construction cause is to transform an economically backward agricultural country into a powerful industrial country with a high level of technology. This requires gradually realizing the industrialization of the country and gradually transitioning to socialism on this basis. Obviously, this is by no means an undertaking that a few people can accomplish. This requires uniting the people of the whole country to participate together, and it also requires uniting all youth to participate together. This congress fully demonstrates that Chinese youth are united and closely united under the banner of Mao Zedong. However, in terms of the state of the youth movement, the unity of youth in all aspects is not extensive enough. Whether it is the Chinese New Democratic Youth League, which is the core force of the youth, or the All-China Youth Federation, which is a mass organization of the youth, the contact with the youth of various fraternal nationalities, youth from the industrial and commercial circles, youth from the religious circles, young scientific and technological workers, and many other unorganized youth in the society is not close enough. We must strengthen our work in this area in the future.

    It should also be pointed out that the construction cause of our country is inseparable from the cause of defending world peace. On the one hand, the help and support of the world peace and democratic forces headed by the Soviet Union is an indispensable condition for the construction cause of our country. On the other hand, every achievement we make in the construction cause is an important contribution to the struggle to defend world peace. We are united with the youth of the whole world. We must continue to strengthen and expand this unity in the future.

    We fully believe that this congress will surely become a powerful congress to mobilize the youth of the whole country to invest in the national construction cause. All members of our Chinese New Democratic Youth League will unite closely with the youth of the whole country, faithfully implement the resolutions of the congress, and strive for their implementation. We have no doubt that the youth of the whole country will enthusiastically respond to the call of the motherland, and under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, with selfless labor and unremitting learning, give full play to their initiative and creativity, and strive to defend and build our great motherland, to gradually realize industrialization and gradually transition to a socialist society.

### 青年团中央书记胡耀邦致祝词

    青年团中央书记胡耀邦致祝词
    中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会书记胡耀邦在中华全国青年第二次代表大会上致词祝贺大会的成功。
    胡耀邦说：中国青年是具有光辉的爱国主义的传统的。在毛主席的教诲下，在中国共产党的领导下，中国青年曾积极参加反对帝国主义侵略和国内反动派的革命斗争，在中华人民共和国成立以后，中国青年又积极参加了抗美援朝运动、各种社会改革运动和生产运动。在这个新的历史时期，中国青年又将在各种建设工作岗位上为国家贡献更多的力量。这是祖国给予青年的新任务，也是对青年一代最大的信任和期望，中国青年是绝不会辜负这种信任和期望的。
    现在我们祖国正在开始有计划建设，在祖国的建设事业中，经济建设工作是全国人民长期的中心任务，经济建设的中心又是工业建设。我们的一切工作都要服从于这一中心任务，服从于发展工业的要求；但是，我们各方面的建设工作，都是整个国家建设事业不可缺少的一部分，任何一个部门都必须依靠各方面工作的彼此配合和互相支援，祖国要求青年坚持和珍视自己的工作岗位。我们要认识到一切有益于人民的工作，都是祖国要求我们担当的工作，一切与国家建设事业有关的事业，都是祖国所需要的事业。因此我们的任务就是在自己的工作岗位上，勤勤恳恳、全心全意、生气勃勃地从事有创造性的劳动，并力求获致积极的劳动成果，为建设祖国这一伟大事业争取胜利和增添光辉。
    但是建设事业是复杂的，艰巨的，这就不仅要求青年有劳动的热情，而且还要有丰富的劳动知识和经验，这就需要学习，顽强地、不倦地学习，特别要在实际工作中学习，使自己成为一个善于劳动的人。祖国对青年在建设中的要求是，要努力学习文化、科学、技术，学习革命理论，提高政治觉悟，学习苏联青年的光辉榜样，学习苏联的先进科学和先进经验，从而能够很有智慧地为祖国的建设而劳动，战胜困难，把自己每日每时的劳动，自觉地联系到伟大祖国的社会主义的前途，联系到青年一代更加幸福美好的将来，这种责任就是中国青年的莫大幸福与光荣。
    我们国家的建设事业，是真正伟大的事业。我们在这一建设事业中所要达到的目的是要把一个经济上落后的农业国家变为一个强大的有高度技术水平的工业国家，这就要逐步实现国家的工业化，并在此基础上逐步过渡到社会主义。很显然，这决不是少数人所能完成的事业。这需要团结全国人民共同参加，也就需要团结全体青年来共同参加。这次大会充分地表现着中国青年是团结的，是紧密团结在毛泽东的旗帜之下的。但是，就青年运动的状况来说，各方面青年的团结是还不够广泛的，无论作为青年的核心力量的中国新民主主义青年团，或作为青年的群众组织的中华全国民主青年联合会，对于各兄弟民族青年、工商界青年、宗教界青年、青年科学技术工作者以及社会上其他许多无组织的青年的联系是还不够密切的。我们今后一定要加强这方面的工作。
    还要指出：我们国家的建设事业，是和保卫世界和平的事业分不开的。一方面，以苏联为首的世界和平民主力量的帮助和支援是我们国家建设事业不可缺少的条件，另一方面，我们在建设事业上的每一个成就也就是对于保卫世界和平斗争的重要贡献。我们是和全世界青年团结在一起的。我们今后要继续加强和扩大这个团结。
    我们完全相信，这次大会，必能有力地成为动员全国青年投入国家建设事业的大会。我们中国新民主主义青年团的全体团员将和全国青年亲密团结起来，忠实执行大会的决议，为其贯彻实现而奋斗。我们毫不怀疑，全国青年一定热烈响应祖国的号召，在毛主席和中国共产党领导下，以忘我的劳动，不懈的学习，充分发挥自己的积极性和创造性，为保卫和建设我们伟大的祖国，为逐步实现工业化并逐渐过渡到社会主义社会而奋斗。    （新华社）
