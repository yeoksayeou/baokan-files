Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 12th. German Communist Party Chairman Max Reimann published an article in the German Communist Party's central organ, "Freies Volk," on the 10th, welcoming the progress made in the Korean armistice negotiations regarding the repatriation of prisoners of war. He said: Like all peace-loving people around the world, the people of West Germany are extremely excited to welcome the news of the agreement reached in Panmunjom. This is a great victory won by the heroic Korean people, who are fighting for their freedom, with the support of the Chinese People's Volunteers.

Reimann also said: The agreement in Korea is also a victory for the peace camp. The agreement was reached also because the Soviet Union has made unremitting efforts to restore peace in Korea.

Reimann condemned the American warmongers and their running dog, Syngman Rhee, for their conspiracy to obstruct the realization of the armistice. He pointed out that the world peace front is very strong, and the warmongers are bound to fail.

Reimann concluded: There is no doubt that the Korean agreement, which was achieved through the struggle of the world's peace forces, will also lead to the resolution of other international disputes. The first of these is a peaceful solution to the German question.

Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 12th. Berlin's democratic newspapers continued to publish news about the Korean armistice negotiations and reactions from around the world in prominent positions on the 11th. "Neues Deutschland" published the full text of the June 9th "People's Daily" editorial from Beijing on the 11th. Many newspaper headlines pointed out that the progress of the Korean armistice negotiations is an encouragement for the peaceful resolution of the German question and the German people's struggle for national unification and national independence.

According to a report by the German News Agency, Franz Franek, a famous labor hero from the Zwickau coal mine and a National Prize winner, welcomed the agreement in Panmunjom, saying: "This is a promising sign of a general relaxation of international tensions." He said: "The time has come to hold negotiations to peacefully resolve the German question. The time has never been as favorable as it is today." Rolf Kahlfass, the chief judge of the Halle district, said: "An agreement has finally been reached, which gives all German patriots new strength in their own national struggle."

A message from Nuremberg, West Germany, from the German News Agency, shows that the progress of the Korean armistice negotiations has aroused a warm response among the people of West Germany. Metal worker Hans Keffer said: "Preventing a war is easier than ending a war, but we must not slacken our efforts to defend peace." Nuremberg's famous doctor, Grinbaum, said: "What is possible in Korea should also be possible in Germany. If Germany remains divided, it will be a major threat to peace."

Xinhua News Agency, Prague. The Czechoslovak Ministry of National Defense's organ, "People's Defense Daily," commented on the Korean armistice negotiations on the 10th, saying: "Peace-loving people all over the world welcome the recently signed agreement on the repatriation of prisoners of war with great pleasure." It said: "The days of ending terrible bloodshed and the suffering of the people are coming. The Korean people, who are defending their freedom and independence with the support of the Chinese People's Volunteers, will be able to return to a peaceful life and will be able to solve their future problems themselves."

"People's Defense Daily" said: Peace in Korea will help ease international tensions and strengthen peace and security in the Far East and the world. This bright future is possible because the Korean and Chinese sides have made tremendous efforts to overcome the obstacles created by the other side. The correctness of the Soviet policy principle that all international disputes can be resolved through negotiation has once again been proven. This proof gives the people of the world new strength in their struggle for peace.

The Czechoslovak Trade Union Central Council's organ, "Labor Daily," pointed out in a short commentary on the 11th that the news of the Korean armistice negotiations is encouraging. The newspaper condemned Syngman Rhee's conspiracy to undermine the realization of peace.

    德国共产党主席雷曼和德国人民
    对朝鲜停战谈判的进展表示热烈欢迎
    捷克斯洛伐克报纸指出朝中方面作了巨大努力
    【新华社柏林十二日电】德国共产党主席马克思·雷曼十日在德国共产党中央机关报“自由人民报”上发表文章，欢迎朝鲜停战谈判关于战俘遣返问题获致协议的进展。他说：像全世界所有爱好和平的人民一样，全西德的人民极兴奋地欢迎在板门店取得协议的消息。这是为自己的自由而斗争的英雄的朝鲜人民在中国志愿军的支持下取得的巨大胜利。
    雷曼又说：朝鲜的协议也是和平阵营的胜利。这所以能达成协议，也是因为苏联为恢复朝鲜和平作了不断的努力。
    雷曼谴责美国的战争贩子和他们的走狗李承晚企图阻挠停战实现的阴谋。他指出，世界和平阵线非常强大，战争贩子们是势必要失败的。
    雷曼最后说：毫无疑问，因为世界和平力量的斗争而达成的朝鲜协议，也会使其它国际纠纷得到解决。这首先就是和平解决德国问题。
    【新华社柏林十二日电】柏林民主报纸十一日继续以显著地位刊载关于朝鲜停战谈判的消息和全世界的反应。“新德意志报”十一日刊载了北京“人民日报”六月九日的社论全文。许多报纸的标题都指出，朝鲜停战谈判的进展，对于和平解决德国问题与德国人民争取全国统一和民族独立的斗争，是一个鼓舞。
    据德意志通讯社报道，兹维考煤矿的著名劳动英雄、国家奖金得奖人弗兰兹·弗兰湼克欢迎板门店的协议说：这是国际紧张局势普遍缓和的有希望的迹象。他说：“这是举行谈判来和平解决德国问题的时候了，时机从来没有像今天这样有利的。”哈雷专区的首席法官罗尔夫·考尔法希说：协议终于达成了，这使所有德国爱国者在他们自己的民族斗争中得到了新的力量。
    德意志通讯社来自西德纽伦堡的消息表明，朝鲜停战谈判的进展，在西德人民中引起热烈的反应。金属工人汉斯·克弗尔说：“防止一个战争要比结束一个战争容易些，但是我们决不能松懈我们保卫和平的努力。”纽伦堡的著名医生格林博姆说：“在朝鲜可能办得到的事情，在德国也应该是可能的。德国假如还是这样分裂下去，就会是对和平的一个重要的威胁。”
    【新华社布拉格讯】捷克斯洛伐克国防部机关报“人民防线报”十日评论朝鲜停战谈判问题说：“全世界爱好和平的人民以极愉快的心情来迎接最近签订的关于战俘遣返的协议。”它说：“结束可怕的流血和人民的苦难的日子将要到来了。在中国人民志愿军的支援下保卫他们的自由和独立的朝鲜人民，将可能重过和平的生活，并可能由他们自己来解决他们将来的问题。” 
    “人民防线报”说：朝鲜的和平将有助于缓和国际紧张局势及加强远东与全世界的和平安全。这种光明前途之所以成为可能，是因为朝中方面在克服对方所制造的障碍上已作了巨大的努力。一切国际纠纷可以用协商方式来解决，这一苏联政策原则的正确性，又一次得到了证明。这一个证明使世界人民在他们为争取和平的斗争中得到了新的力量。
    捷克斯洛伐克工会中央理事会机关报“劳动报”十一日在短评中指出，朝鲜停战谈判的消息是令人鼓舞的。该报斥责李承晚破坏实现和平的阴谋。
