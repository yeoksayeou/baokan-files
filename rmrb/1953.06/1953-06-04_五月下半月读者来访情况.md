Reader Visits in the Second Half of May

In the second half of May, this newspaper received a total of 245 visitors, with 93 issues discussed. Among them, there were 27 cases criticizing the People's Courts in some areas for not handling cases promptly, and criticizing certain district and village cadres for coercive orders and illegal and undisciplined behavior. There were still many requests for resolving disputes over houses, land, and creditor's rights, and requests for job introductions. For these issues, we have taken action according to the nature of the problem: some visitors were directed to relevant departments to resolve the issues themselves; for the more important issues, this newspaper sent letters to relevant departments requesting investigation and handling, and will reply to the visitors after receiving the results. The following issues are worth mentioning:

	Just as the Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau is vigorously rectifying traffic order, Zhao Qingrong, a tricycle worker, visited this newspaper and offered three positive suggestions for strengthening tricycle management. He said: "Currently, there are still many tricycle workers who have not strictly implemented the regulations that they must wear badges to drive, which adds to the difficulties in traffic management; secondly, since there is no limit to the load capacity of tricycles, some tricycle workers, in order to make more money, carry excessive loads, resulting in traffic accidents; thirdly, since there are no uniform regulations for fares, and the tricycle workers' union does not conduct regular ideological education for tricycle workers, disputes caused by some tricycle workers arbitrarily charging fares and deceiving passengers (especially farmers and cadres from other places coming to Beijing) continue to occur, which not only hinders traffic order but also gives customers a bad impression. Therefore, he suggested that the Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau and the tricycle workers' union cooperate with each other to strengthen ideological education and organizational management for tricycle workers, strictly implement the regulations that those without badges are not allowed to drive, and promptly study specific methods for tiered pricing and quantitative load limits. We believe that visitor Zhao Qingrong's opinions are very good, and we ask the above-mentioned authorities to carefully study them and reply to us with the results of their study.

	Two workers from the Dyeing and Weaving Factory No. 1, which is affiliated with the Beijing Municipal Industrial Company, came to this newspaper to report that the factory director and engineering staff did not value the opinions of the workers, and did not mobilize the workers to discuss production plans during the production competition campaign, which led to low worker morale and other problems. After we conveyed the above opinions to the company's leadership, they quickly sent comrades from the company's supervision office to this newspaper to understand the workers' full opinions, and stated that they would further investigate the workers' opinions and production situation in the factory, and then study and handle the matter.

	During this half-month, four government workers and students from Hunan, Rehe, Shanxi, and Shaanxi who came to Beijing for medical treatment requested this newspaper to help them solve difficulties in treatment and finances. Before coming to Beijing, they had not contacted relevant hospitals or completed treatment or hospitalization procedures; after arriving in Beijing, due to the limitations of equipment and conditions in various hospitals, they could not receive timely treatment, and had to wait again and again, resulting in worsening illness or financial difficulties. Some of them had their treatment problems resolved through our contact with relevant hospitals within the realm of what was possible, but some could only be advised to return to their place of origin for treatment. Therefore, people coming to Beijing for medical treatment must first contact relevant departments or hospitals in Beijing and complete the procedures; otherwise, it will be detrimental to their health and finances. We hope that local authorities will also pay attention to and strictly control this issue, so as to avoid difficulties for patients in Beijing.

### 五月下半月读者来访情况

    五月下半月读者来访情况
    五月下半月本报共接待来访者二百四十五人，谈问题的有九十三起。其中对某些地方人民法院处理案件不及时，对某些区村干部的强迫命令和违法乱纪行为提出批评的共有二十七起，要求解决房、地、债权纠纷和介绍职业的仍然很多。对于这些问题，我们已根据问题性质进行了处理：有的介绍来访者到有关部门自行解决；其中比较重要的问题，则由本报函请有关部门调查处理，待有结果后再答复访者。这里值得提出的有下列几个：
    正当目前北京市公安部门大力整顿交通秩序的时候，三轮车工人赵庆荣来访问本报，他对加强三轮车管理方面提出了三点积极建议。他说：“现在还有不少三轮车工人没有严格执行必须配带胸章方能驾驶的规定，这就给交通管理上增加了困难；其次，由于三轮车载重量没有限制，有的三轮工人为贪图更多的运费，载货过重，以致造成车祸；第三、由于车价没有统一规定，而三轮车工会对三轮车工人的思想教育又不够经常，以致由于有些三轮车工人乱要车钱，欺骗乘客（尤其对于农民和外地来京干部）而引起的争吵事件不断发生，这不但有碍交通秩序，同时也给顾客一种不良的印象。因此他建议北京市公安部门和三轮车工会组织互相配合，对三轮车工人加强思想教育与组织管理，严格贯彻无胸章者不得行车的规定，并迅速研究分段定价、载重定量的具体办法。我们认为访者赵庆荣的意见很好，请上述机关慎重研究，并将研究结果答复我们。
    北京市实业公司所属染织一厂有两位工人来本报，反映该厂厂长和工务人员不重视工人意见，在生产竞赛运动中没有发动工人讨论生产计划，以致工人生产情绪不高等情况。我们将上述意见转告该公司领导方面后，他们很快就派公司监察室的同志来本报了解工人的全部意见，并表示将深入该厂进一步调查工人意见和生产情况，然后研究处理。
    在这半个月中，曾有四个从湖南、热河、山西、陕西等地来京治病的机关工作人员和学生，要求本报帮助他们解决治疗、经济等困难。他们在来京之前没有和有关医院取得联系，办妥治疗或住院等手续；到京后，由于各医院设备和条件的限制，他们不能及时得到治疗，一等再等，以致病势加重或经济发生困难。其中有的经本报与有关医院联系，在可能的条件下，解决了他的治疗问题，但有的只得劝他回原地治疗。因此，来京治病的人事先必须和北京有关部门或医院取得联系，办妥手续；否则对自己的健康和经济都是不利的。希望各地机关也能注意并严格掌握这个问题，以免病人在京发生困难。
