    Xinhua News Agency, June 5th: The Second National Education Work Conference, convened by the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government, opened in Beijing on June 5th. Participants in the conference included leading members of the Ministry of Education of the Central Government, the Education Bureaus of the Major Administrative Areas, the Education Departments and Bureaus of various provinces and cities, and some primary school principals and teachers from the North China region.

    The tasks of this conference are: to discuss and determine the working guidelines for general education and teacher training; to study how to rectify primary schools; to agree on a plan to run a number of middle schools and teacher training schools well with a focus, and to study how to complete the enrollment tasks for middle schools and teacher training schools this year; in addition, to preliminarily exchange opinions on the division of responsibilities, organizational structure, and the establishment of necessary working systems for education administrative departments at all levels. The conference will focus on the issue of rectifying primary school education.

    Guo Moruo, Director of the Cultural and Educational Committee of the Central People's Government, spoke at the opening meeting. He pointed out: The convening of this conference is necessary and timely. Our country has entered a period of planned economic construction. During this period, the state has also put forward new and arduous tasks for educational construction. That is, it must properly adapt to the needs of economic construction and train a large number of qualified construction talents for the country. In the past three years, significant achievements have been made in the restoration, reform, and development of education, but the development of education still carries great blindness. The use of manpower, material resources, and financial resources has not been well concentrated on key undertakings, and many tasks have tended to be greedy and rash, seeking only quantity and neglecting quality. At the same time, there is a lack of in-depth inspection and practical investigation and research in the work, so education work is in a rather serious passive state. In response to the above serious shortcomings, future education work must implement the general guideline of cultural and educational construction determined by the Central Committee: "Rectification and Consolidation, Focused Development, Guarantee of Quality, and Steady Progress." The implementation of this guideline is to closely cooperate with the country's economic construction, cultivate qualified construction talents, and prepare for the planned development of cultural and educational undertakings in the future. Director Guo Moruo pointed out: Looking at the entire education system, higher education is the focus, and general education is the foundation. In general education, there should also be a focus. First, run high schools well to prepare reserve forces for cultivating advanced construction talents; second, run teacher training schools at all levels well, especially higher normal colleges, to prepare talents for cultivating talents. He finally pointed out that to implement the guideline of "Rectification and Consolidation, Focused Development, Guarantee of Quality, and Steady Progress," it is also necessary to oppose departmentalism and conservatism; oppose the one-sided mass viewpoint that does not conform to the fundamental and long-term interests of the country. At the same time, and more importantly, education administrative departments at all levels should in the future constantly and tirelessly carry out a resolute struggle against the bad phenomena of bureaucracy.

    Zhang Xiruo, Minister of Education of the Central People's Government, made a report on education work at the meeting, pointing out that there are currently two serious imbalances in education work, namely the imbalance between education and the national economy, and the imbalance within the education system. Correctly and systematically solving this imbalance is the central requirement of future education work. Based on the above situation, the focus of general education in the future should be on strengthening ordinary middle schools, especially high schools, and the key is to vigorously strengthen and develop higher normal colleges to train middle school teachers. These schools should continue to implement the policy of opening up to workers and peasants, and pay more attention to increasing the proportion of workers. Other aspects such as primary schools, worker-peasant spare time education, secondary normal schools, kindergartens, etc., should focus on rectification and consolidation, generally not developing, and junior high schools do not need to develop greatly. Then, he put forward detailed methods and requirements for running complete middle schools and high schools well, improving and cultivating teachers, and rectifying primary schools, and submitted them to the conference for discussion.

    全国教育工作会议开幕
    会议以整顿小学教育为中心议题并讨论普通教育和师范教育方针
    【新华社五日讯】中央人民政府教育部召开的第二次全国教育工作会议六月五日在北京开幕。参加这次会议的有中央教育部及各大行政区教育局，各省、市教育厅、局的负责人和华北区的部分小学校长和教师。
    这次会议的任务是：讨论和确定普通教育和师范教育的工作方针；研究如何整顿小学；商定有重点地办好一批中学、师范学校的方案和研究如何完成中学、师范学校今年的招生任务；此外，对各级教育行政部门分工职掌、机构设置以及建立必要的工作制度问题初步交换意见。会议的中心将着重研究整顿小学教育问题。
    中央人民政府政务院文化教育委员会主任郭沫若在开幕会上讲话。他指出：这个会议的召开是必要的和适时的。我们国家已进入有计划的经济建设时期。在这一时期中，国家同时也给教育建设提出了新的艰巨任务。这就是必须妥当地适应着经济建设的需要，为国家培养出大量的合格的建设人材。过去三年教育工作在进行恢复、改革和发展方面已获得了显著的成绩，但在教育工作的发展上还带着极大的盲目性，人力、物力、财力的使用没有很好地集中到重点事业上，许多工作存在着贪多冒进、只求数量忽视质量的偏向。同时在工作上又缺乏深入的检查和切实的调查研究，因此教育工作就处于相当严重的被动状态。针对以上的严重缺点，今后的教育工作必须贯彻中央确定的“整顿巩固，重点发展，保证质量，稳步前进”的文教建设的总方针。贯彻这一方针是为着密切配合国家的经济建设，培养合格的建设人材，并为今后文教事业的有计划地发展作好准备。郭沫若主任指出：以整个教育看，高等教育是重点，普通教育是基础，在普通教育中，同样要有重点，首先是办好高中，准备好培养高级建设人材的后备力量；其次要办好各级师范，特别是要办好高等师范，准备培养人材的人材。他最后指出：要贯彻“整顿巩固，重点发展，保证质量，稳步前进”的方针，还必须反对本位主义、保守主义；反对不合乎国家的根本长远利益的片面群众观点。同时，更重要的是今后各级教育行政部门，应该经常不倦地与官僚主义的恶劣现象进行坚决的斗争。
    中央人民政府教育部部长张奚若在会上作了关于教育工作的报告，指出当前教育工作严重地存在着两种不平衡状况，即教育事业和国民经济之间的不平衡以及教育事业内部的不平衡。正确地和有步骤地解决这个不平衡问题是今后教育工作的中心要求。根据上述情况，今后普通教育的重点应放在加强普通中学，尤其是高中，而其关键是大力加强和发展高等师范，培养中学师资。这些学校都应继续贯彻向工农开门的方针，更应注意增加工人成份。其他如小学、工农业余教育、中等师范、幼儿园等应着重整顿巩固，一般地不作发展，初中也不必大发展。接着他就办好完全中学和高中、提高和培养师资、整顿小学等方面分别提出了详细的办法和要求，提交大会讨论。
