    The Second National Youth Congress, reflecting the high enthusiasm and heroic deeds of young people from all walks of life and all ethnic groups across the country in defending and building the motherland, summarized the valuable experiences of the youth movement over the past four years, determined the future direction and tasks of youth work, and called on the young generation of our country to better strive for the planned construction of the motherland. This is a historically significant meeting for the youth of the country. The heartfelt speeches of the youth representatives from various countries who were invited to attend the conference demonstrated the deep friendship of democratic youth from various countries towards the youth of our country, which further enriched the content and significance of the conference, promoted mutual understanding between Chinese and foreign democratic youth, and strengthened their close unity in the great cause of safeguarding peace and democracy.

    Since the First National Youth Congress held in 1949, tremendous and profound changes have taken place in both China and the world. Under the increasingly strong situation of world peace and democratic forces, the people of our country, closely united under the banner of Mao Zedong, have been advancing with heroic steps, overcoming various difficulties, and leaping from one victory to another. Today, our great motherland calls on the people of the whole country to use their intelligent minds and hardworking hands to plan and build our new society and new life, and gradually pave the way to socialism and communism. This is precisely the time when young people, who are particularly rich in ideals and enthusiasm, can fully exert their wisdom and strength.

    In the past four years, the vast number of young people in our country have experienced profound social changes, received rich and vivid practical education, and universally improved their ideological level and political awareness, recognizing the supreme glory of serving the motherland and the people. On all fronts and in various jobs, many young people have been fighting, working, and studying selflessly, making great contributions and meritorious deeds to the motherland and the people. All of this has provided an unprecedentedly broad and solid foundation for the youth movement in our country, enabling the national youth to unite more widely and closely under the general goal of defending and building the motherland, united around Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, and to serve the people more actively and effectively. This is the practical significance of this congress and its various resolutions.

    In order to realize the resolutions of this congress, young people across the country should first seriously sum up their work experience and learning experience, and resolutely remove all stumbling blocks that hinder their progress. The vast number of young people are willing to devote themselves to the most intensive jobs in economic construction, which is in line with the needs of the country and is fully worthy of encouragement. However, it is undeniable that many young people still lack sufficient understanding of the complex and arduous task of national construction, and still have various unrealistic ideas. Some young people oppose economic construction work to other work, believing that only by going to large factories and large construction sites can the aspirations of young people be realized, while office work, school work, rural work, etc., are not exciting enough and do not smell of economic construction; some even think that doing these jobs is a "waste of youth." Young comrades with this kind of thinking may not necessarily see the "excitement" they imagine even if they go to large factories and large construction sites, because fantasy and reality are always two different things. And even if you see the excitement, so what? The key to the problem is not whether the work is exciting, but whether you have the spirit of hard work and the perseverance to overcome difficulties. If you do not make practical efforts, and only feel that this is not interesting enough, that there are difficulties there, and that you always think other things are better, then that is truly "wasting youth."

    Youth is a great creative force, but only when it is combined with a realistic spirit can it fully exert its role. Our economic construction is not empty talk. We have huge natural resources, a people's government that can utilize these resources and is warmly supported by the people of the whole country, the wise leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, the assistance of the Soviet Union and various people's democratic countries, and the construction foundation provided by more than three years of economic recovery and development. But these are not enough, and we must add the subjective efforts of the people of the whole country. Economic construction requires the accumulation of funds, so we must practice economy and oppose waste; economic construction requires science and technology, so we must overcome the strongholds of science and technology; economic construction requires a large number of vibrant, virtuous, and talented cadres, so we must work and study diligently and train ourselves to become such cadres; economic construction requires the cooperation of all aspects of work, so we must strive to do our job well, train ourselves and improve ourselves in practical work, and gradually make ourselves experts in a certain field. Large industry and small industry must be linked together, state-owned enterprises and private enterprises must be linked together, industrial construction and other economic construction must be linked together, economic construction must be linked to all aspects of life, work and study, and must be linked to the daily labor results and academic achievements of each person. We must make everything revolve around economic construction and serve economic construction in all aspects. In the cause of economic construction, everyone should give full play to a high degree of initiative, enthusiasm, and creativity in their respective posts, and use every brick and tile to build our motherland.

    The youth of New China must have ideals and ambitions, and must have longing for the prospects of socialism and communism, but they must transform this ambition and longing into concrete strength to push themselves to move forward steadily and calmly. Young people need enthusiasm and courage, but they also need real skills and the perseverance to overcome difficulties. Comrade Stalin said at the Eighth Congress of the All-Union Leninist Young Communist League in 1928: "Comrades, it must be understood that the conditions of the current struggle are different from those during the Civil War. During the Civil War, enemy positions could be taken by attack, courage, force, and cavalry-like charge. Now, under the conditions of peaceful economic construction, a cavalry-like charge can only ruin things. Courage and force are as necessary now as before. However, courage and force alone will not go very far." This profound instruction has great educational significance for the youth of New China.

    In order to correct one's own thinking and style of work, studying the works of Lenin and Stalin and learning from the experience of Soviet socialist construction is of paramount importance. From these studies, you can not only see the brilliance of mankind's highest ideals, but also see a high degree of down-to-earth and realistic spirit; you can not only gain the firm confidence necessary for building the motherland, but also obtain living examples of constantly overcoming difficulties on the road to victory; you will not only see the selfless activities of old Bolsheviks who have been tempered in the fire, but also see how the vibrant younger generation is tempering their political qualities in the solemn cause of labor construction, learning real work skills, and conquering solid scientific fortresses.

    The youth of New China, growing up in the era of socialism and people's democracy, must possess the noblest qualities as described by Kalinin, "that is, to be good at working happily even in ordinary and commonplace environments, to be good at overcoming the obstacles that arise every day, so that the various obstacles that appear before him in daily life every day and every hour will not extinguish his high spirits, to make these difficult and troublesome daily obstacles develop and consolidate his tension, and to make him see the ultimate goal in this ordinary work, and never forget the ultimate goal for which communism strives." Because only this daily hard work can truly promote the development of the times and realize our "ultimate goal."

    Our motherland is a broad and brand-new world. As long as you abandon any unrealistic ideas and develop a hard-working and pragmatic style, everyone can gain their own honor from practical work. Let this congress be a sign of a new stage in the youth movement of our country, and let the youth of the whole country strive to implement the resolutions of this congress!

### 为实现全国青年第二次代表大会的决议而奋斗

    为实现全国青年第二次代表大会的决议而奋斗
    中华全国青年第二次代表大会，反映了全国各阶层、各民族广大青年保卫祖国、建设祖国的高涨热情和英勇事迹，总结了四年来青年运动的宝贵经验，确定了今后青年工作的方针和任务，号召我国年青的一代，更好地为祖国有计划的建设事业而奋斗。这是全国青年具有历史意义的大会。应邀出席大会的各国青年代表们的恳切致词，表明了各国民主青年对我国青年的深厚友谊，这就益发丰富了大会的内容和意义，促进了中外民主青年的相互了解，加强了彼此在保卫和平民主的伟大事业上的亲密团结。
    从一九四九年举行的中华全国青年第一次代表大会以来，全中国、全世界都发生了巨大的、深刻的变化。在世界和平民主力量日益强大的形势下，紧紧团结在毛泽东旗帜下的我国人民，跨着英雄的脚步，克服了种种困难，从一个胜利跃进到另一个胜利。今天，我们伟大的祖国号召全国人民用聪明的头脑和勤劳的双手，有计划地建设我们的新社会、新生活，逐步铺设通向社会主义、共产主义的大道。这正是特别富有理想和热情的青年们充分发挥智慧和力量的时候。
    在过去的四年中，我国广大青年经历了深刻的社会变革，受到了丰富生动的实际教育，普遍提高了思想水平和政治觉悟，认识了为祖国和人民服务的无上光荣。在各个战线上，在各种工作岗位上，许多青年忘我地战斗着，工作着，学习着，对祖国和人民有很大的贡献，立下了很大的功劳。这一切为我国青年运动提供了空前广泛而坚实的基础，使得全国青年能够更广泛、更紧密地团结在保卫祖国、建设祖国的总目标下，团结在毛主席和共产党的周围，更积极、更有效地为人民服务。这就是这次代表大会及其各项决议的现实意义。
    为了实现这次代表大会的决议，全国青年首先应该认真总结自己的工作经验和学习经验，坚决扫除一切阻碍自己前进的绊脚石。广大青年愿意投身到经济建设最紧张的工作岗位上去，这是与国家的需要相符合的，是完全值得鼓励的。但是，不可讳言，不少青年对于复杂艰巨的国家建设事业，还缺乏足够的认识，还有各种不切实际的想法。有些青年把经济建设工作跟其他工作对立起来，认为只有到大工厂、大工地去，才能实现青年人的抱负，而机关工作、学校工作、农村工作等等，都不够轰轰烈烈，嗅不到经济建设的气味；甚至认为做这些工作，就是“浪费青春”。抱着这种思想的青年同志即使到了大工厂、大工地，也不一定能看出他们想像中的“轰轰烈烈”，因为空想和现实总是两回事。而且即使看到了轰轰烈烈，又怎样呢？问题的关键不在于工作是否轰轰烈烈，而在于你有没有刻苦钻研的工作精神和不怕困难、勇于克服困难的工作毅力。如果不作实际的努力，只觉得这里不够味，那里有困难，这山望见那山高，那才是真正“浪费青春”。
    青春是伟大的创造力量，但只有跟实事求是的精神结合起来，才能充分发挥这种力量的作用。我们的经济建设不是一句空话。我们有巨大的天然富源，有能够利用这些富源、为全国人民热烈拥护的人民政权，有毛主席和共产党的英明领导，有苏联和各人民民主国家的帮助，有三年多经济恢复和发展工作所提供的建设基础。但光有这些还不够，还得加上全国人民的主观努力。经济建设需要资金的积累，我们就得身体力行地提倡节约，反对浪费；经济建设需要科学技术，我们就得百折不挠地攻下科学技术的堡垒；经济建设需要大量生气勃勃、德才兼备的干部，我们就得勤勤恳恳地工作和学习，把自己锻炼成这样的干部；经济建设需要各方面工作的配合，我们就得努力做好本岗位的工作，在实际工作中锻炼自己，提高自己，逐步使自己成为某一方面的专才。大工业和小工业必须联系起来，国营企业和私营企业必须联系起来，工业建设和其他经济建设必须联系起来，经济建设和各方面的生活、工作和学习都必须联系起来，和每一个人的日常劳动成果和学习成绩也必须联系起来。我们要使一切都围绕着经济建设而活动，从各方面为经济建设服务。在经济建设事业中，个个人都应该在本岗位上发挥高度的主动性、积极性和创造性，用一砖一瓦来建设我们的祖国。
    新中国的青年要有理想和抱负，要有对于社会主义、共产主义远景的憧憬，但必须把这种抱负和憧憬转化为具体的力量，推动自己踏踏实实地沉着前进。青年人需要热情和勇敢，同时也需要真实的本领和克服困难的毅力。斯大林同志一九二八年在苏联列宁共产主义青年团第八次代表大会上说：“同志们，必须懂得现在的斗争条件比起国内战争时期是不同了。在国内战争时期，敌人阵地是可以用攻打、勇敢、猛力、骑兵似的冲锋取得的。现在，在和平经济建设条件下，用骑兵似的冲锋只能是把事情搞坏。勇敢和猛力现在也如以前一样是需要的。但是，只靠勇敢和猛力是走不很远的。”这个深刻的指示，对于新中国的青年，有绝大的教育意义。
    为了端正自己的思想作风，学习列宁、斯大林的著作，学习苏联社会主义建设经验，就有头等重要的意义。从这些学习中，你不但可以看到人类最高理想的光辉，而且可以看到高度的脚踏实地、实事求是的精神；你不但可以取得为建设祖国所必需的坚定信心，而且能够取得在胜利途程上不断克服困难的活生生的榜样；你不但会看到百炼成钢的老布尔什维克们的忘我活动，而且会看到生气勃勃的年青的一代怎样在劳动建设的庄严事业中锻炼自己的政治品质，学习真实的工作本领，攻下坚固的科学堡垒。
    生长在社会主义和人民民主时代的新中国青年，必须具有像加里宁所说的那种最高贵的品质，“就是要善于在普通平常环境中也兴高采烈地工作，要善于逐日克服不断发生的障碍，要使实际生活中每日每时在他面前出现的种种障碍，不致于扑灭他的高涨情绪，要使这些困难麻烦的日常障碍，反而能发展并巩固他的紧张精神，要使他在这种寻常工作中看清终极目标，永远也不忘记共产主义所奋斗的这种终极目标。”因为只有这种日常的刻苦努力，才能真正推动时代的发展，才能实现我们的“终极目标”。
    我们的祖国是宽广的崭新的天地，只要丢掉任何不切实际的想法，养成艰苦踏实的作风，个个人都能够从实际工作中取得自己的荣誉。让这次代表大会成为我国青年运动新阶段的标志，让全国青年都为实现这次大会的决议而奋斗吧。
