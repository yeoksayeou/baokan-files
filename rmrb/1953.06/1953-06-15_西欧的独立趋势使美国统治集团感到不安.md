    Xinhua News Agency, June 14th: "The sensational speech by U.S. Republican leader Taft has strengthened the trend in Western European capitals to regain political, economic, and military independence on the continent." This was stated in a Bonn dispatch published by the West German "Eight O'Clock Journal" on May 29th. The dispatch also pointed out that talk of "European neutrality" and a so-called "third force" between East and West is circulating in Paris and London. The newspaper also said that diplomatic circles are rumored that Churchill has a plan to unite Britain, France, Italy, and West Germany, along with their colonies, to form a third bloc parallel to the Soviet Union and the United States.

    This trend of Western Europe going its own way, coupled with some recent significant developments in Western European politics—the great victory of democratic forces in the Italian elections, the protracted French government crisis, and the unprecedentedly high call for consultations with the Soviet Union to resolve international disputes—has made the United States very uneasy. "The political situation in Europe is changing, and it seems that its trend can only be unfavorable to American policies and interests," worried "New York Times" reporter Sulzberger in his dispatch from Paris. He admitted that things like the results of the Italian elections, the continuing government crisis in France, and the Soviet "peace offensive" all show that the forces supporting the U.S. Cold War policy are "declining." Sulzberger said: "Unless this trend is checked, it is a bad omen for the entire U.S. political and strategic policy and for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization." According to him, the number of people in Western European countries who are inclined towards the North Atlantic Alliance and pro-Americanism has "obviously decreased."

    Associated Press reporter James Marlowe issued a dispatch from Washington on the 11th, revealing the annoyance of the American ruling clique with the increasing reluctance of Western European countries to continue following the American war and Cold War policies. Marlowe said: "Cracks in unity have appeared." He complained about "aging and tired Western Europe," saying: "They want nothing more than peace; they fear nothing more than war caused by American actions that may provoke an offensive." He also blamed Western European countries for not being enthusiastic about continuing the Korean War. He said: "Although the United States bears almost all the burden of the West in terms of manpower and money, Western European countries are gradually getting tired of this war." He also said that although these countries are still "clearly trying to rearm, they are basically very tired of it." What makes Marlowe even more troubled is that despite the efforts of the United States and its agents in Western Europe to promote the "threat of Soviet aggression," the facts of the past three years have convinced many Western Europeans that "Russia will not attack at all." Therefore, Marlowe believes that the problem now facing Eisenhower is that he "not only has to deal with the Chinese and the Russians, but also with the leaders of Western democracies."

### 西欧的独立趋势使美国统治集团感到不安

    西欧的独立趋势使美国统治集团感到不安
    【新华社十四日讯】“由于美国共和党领袖塔夫脱所发表的耸人听闻的演说，西欧各国的首都加强了夺回大陆的政治、经济及军事方面的独立性的趋势。”这是西德“八点钟报”在五月二十九日发表的波恩通讯中所说的。这篇通讯还指出在巴黎和伦敦流传着关于“欧洲中立”和所谓东西方之间的“第三种力量”的说法。该报并说，外交界正传说邱吉尔有一个计划，准备联合英、法、意、西德四国及其殖民地，以组成与苏、美并列的第三个集团。
    西欧方面这种自行其是的趋势，加上西欧政治上最近的一些意义重大的发展——意大利大选中民主力量的巨大胜利，法国政府危机的旷日持久以及要求与苏联协商解决国际争论的呼声空前高涨，使美国方面很不安。“纽约时报”记者苏兹贝格在他的自巴黎发出的电讯中忧虑地说：“欧洲的政治局面正在起着变化，看来它的趋势对美国的政策与利益只会是不利的。”他承认，像意大利选举结果，法国持续的政府危机和苏联的“和平攻势”这些事情都说明，美国冷战政策所赖以支持的力量“正在衰退下去”。苏兹贝格说：“除非这种趋势受到制止，否则它对美国整个政治和战略政策以及北大西洋公约组织都是一种凶兆。”照他的说法，在西欧国家中，倾向北大西洋联盟和亲美的人“显然已经减少了”。
    美联社的记者詹姆斯·马劳十一日从华盛顿发出一则电讯，透露了美国统治集团因西欧国家愈来愈不愿继续追随美国的战争和冷战政策而感到的恼怒。马劳说：“团结的裂痕已经出现。”他埋怨“衰老而疲惫的西欧”说：“它们什么都不想要，就是要和平；它们什么都不怕，就是怕由于美国采取可能引起进攻的行动”而引起战争。他并责备西欧国家不热心于继续进行朝鲜战争。他说：“尽管美国在人力与金钱方面几乎负担了西方所有的负担，西欧各国还是渐渐厌烦起这个战争来。”他还说，这些国家虽然还“显然在竭力重整军备，可是基本上它们还是很感到厌倦”。更加使得马劳头痛的是：尽管美国及其在西欧的代理人竭力宣传“苏联侵略的威胁”，但三年来的事实已使许多西欧人相信“俄国根本不会进攻”。因此马劳认为，现在摆在艾森豪威尔面前的难题是他“不仅要对付中国人和俄国人，而且还要对付西方民主国家的领袖们”。
