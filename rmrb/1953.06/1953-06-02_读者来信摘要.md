Reader Letters Summary

    The Heishan County People's Court Should Not Delay Handling the Yang Guangcai Murder Case
    Reader Xie Donghai writes: The Heishan County People's Court in Liaoxi Province has been slow to handle the Yang Guangcai murder case. Yang Guangcai was 28 years old, a Communist Party member, secretary of the Zhangjia Wobeng Village branch in the sixth district of Heishan County, and director of the village's cooperative. He was always active in his work and deeply loved by the masses. The village chief, Qin Fengqi, was a bad element. During the land reform, he embezzled the fruits of the masses' struggle, beat and scolded people at will, arbitrarily conscripted labor in the village to work for himself, set up gambling dens and skimmed profits, and privately pocketed the telegraph poles and construction stones donated by the masses to the People's Government. The masses and other cadres in the village had struggled against Qin Fengqi's illegal and undisciplined behavior and reported it to the higher-level People's Government. Yang Guangcai was the most active in these struggles, and Qin Fengqi held a grudge against him, regarding him as a thorn in his side. Last March, the district People's Government confirmed Qin Fengqi's bad behavior and removed him from his position as village chief. As a result, Qin Fengqi harbored even greater resentment towards Yang Guangcai. On the morning of May 28th last year, Qin Fengqi went to the cooperative and stabbed Comrade Yang Guangcai four times in a row. Two hours later, Yang Guangcai unfortunately died from his injuries. The culprit fled in fear of punishment but was caught by local primary school students and sent to the Heishan County People's Court for handling. It has been almost a year now, but the county People's Court has been delaying the matter. Comrade Yang Guangcai's mother cries every day, devastated by this, and the masses are also very dissatisfied. I suggest that the higher-level People's Court promptly investigate and handle this matter.
    The Yantai City People's Court and Public Security Bureau Should Not Ignore Yang Jianqiang's Accusation Letter
    Reader Yang Jianqiang writes: The Yantai City People's Court, Public Security Bureau, and the Yantai Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and other agencies are extremely irresponsible in handling letters from the people. I wrote a letter accusing counter-revolutionary elements, which was forwarded by the Shandong Provincial People's Court to the Yantai City People's Court this January, requesting them to handle it in conjunction with the Yantai City Public Security Bureau and the relevant departments of the Yantai Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. The plaintiff and I went to the city court to inquire about it three or four dozen times, and the city court kept pushing the matter to the municipal committee. The plaintiff and I then went to ask the municipal committee, and the municipal committee said, "The materials are only kept here for reference. The problem still needs to be handled by the court; we don't care." We went back to the court, and the court said that the Public Security Bureau should handle it. But the Public Security Bureau remained indifferent. I wrote a letter to the Public Security Bureau, stating that if the case was not handled, there was a risk of loss of life. The Public Security Bureau only replied, "Don't worry, the problem will eventually be resolved." Afterwards, nothing was done. We request the Shandong Sub-Bureau of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Shandong Provincial People's Government People's Supervision Committee to promptly investigate and handle the matter.
    Attention Should Be Paid to the Content of Books When Publishing Children's Literature
    Ma Jingmin from the Lizhai Complete Primary School in Luoyang County, Henan, writes: The Shanghai Children's Publishing House reprinted 10,000 copies of the old opera script "Liang Zhu Marriage" in February of this year. Booksellers are promoting this opera script to schools. The story of Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai is one of China's beautiful folk legends. However, the content of this book is full of clichés and has a strong feudal superstitious flavor. The book begins with: "Recite a poem to appease the deity, present the Jade Venerable above, the Golden Boy and Jade Girl descend to the world, destined to be unmarried for three lifetimes." Later, it says that Zhu Yingtai's fiancé, Ma Sanlang, weeps before the King of Hell after his death, saying that Liang Shanbo has seized his wife. The King of Hell checks his lifespan and finds that it has not ended, releases him to return to the world, and tells him that Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai are the Golden Boy and Jade Girl and cannot marry mortals. When publishing children's literature, the educational effect of the book's content on children should be considered first. It is wrong to reprint an old opera script with such erroneous content.
    The Health of Pregnant Actresses Should Be Protected
    Ding Fan of the Cultural Troupe of the Logistics Department of the Northeast Military Region writes: Recently, I saw the Jiaohe County Pingju Opera Troupe perform "Loyal Martyrs and Loving Couple" in Jiaohe County. The two actresses who played the daughter of a mountain village chieftain and a certain soldier, respectively, were both pregnant. The actress playing the chieftain's daughter had a particularly heavy role, appearing on stage in almost every scene from beginning to end. In addition to singing and acting, she also had to fight with people, flip somersaults on stage, lie on her stomach, and spin with a gun. Although this actress performed very hard, because the role was heavy and she was pregnant, her performance was still difficult, her breathing was tight, and her movements were slow. Not only did it fail to achieve the desired performance effect, but it also made the audience worried about her. I believe that allowing pregnant actresses to perform intensely physical martial arts scenes is harmful to their health and hope that it will attract sufficient attention from the relevant theater troupes.

    读者来信摘要
    黑山县人民法院不应拖延处理杨广财被杀事件
    读者谢东海来信：辽西省黑山县人民法院迟迟不处理杨广财被杀事件。杨广财年二十八岁，共产党员，黑山县六区张家窝棚村支部书记，也是该村合作社主任，他一向工作积极，深为群众爱戴。该村村长秦凤岐是个坏分子，土地改革中曾经贪污群众斗争果实，随便打人骂人，随便在村中抽工为他自己干活，设赌抽头，强奸妇女，私吞群众捐献给人民政府的电线杆和建筑用的石头等。村中群众和其他干部曾经向秦凤岐的这些违法乱纪行为作过斗争，向上级人民政府反映过，其中斗争最积极的就是杨广财，因此被秦凤岐怀恨在心，把他看作眼中钉。去年三月，区人民政府证实了秦凤岐的恶劣行为，遂撤了他村长的职务。于是，秦凤岐对杨广财更加怀恨。去年五月二十八日清晨，秦凤岐竟到合作社向杨广财同志连刺四刀。两小时后，杨广财因伤重不治，不幸死去。凶犯畏罪潜逃，被当地小学学生捉住，并送黑山县人民法院处理。到现在快一年了，但县人民法院对这事一直拖延未办。杨广财同志的母亲每天为这事哭得死去活来，群众也很不满意。我建议上级人民法院迅速检查处理。
    烟台市人民法院和公安局等不应该不理杨健强的检举信
    读者杨健强来信：山东省烟台市人民法院、公安局和中共烟台市委等机关对待人民来信极不负责。我写的一封检举反革命分子的信，于今年一月经山东省人民法院转交烟台市人民法院，请他们会同烟台市公安局和中共烟台市委等有关部门处理。我和控诉人连续到该市法院问过三、四十次，该市法院都把这事推给市委。我又和控诉人去问市委，市委说：“材料不过是留在这里参考一下，问题还得法院处理，我们不管。”我们再去法院，法院又说要公安局处理。但公安局也不闻不问。我便写信给公安局，说明再不处理此案就有发生人命的危险。公安局仅回信说：“不要发急，问题始终要处理的。”以后仍然没有处理。我们要求中共中央山东分局和山东省人民政府人民监察委员会迅速检查处理。
    出版儿童读物时应注意书籍内容
    河南洛阳县立潘寨完全小学马敬民来信：上海儿童出版社在今年二月间翻印了旧唱本“梁祝姻缘”一万册。书商把这种唱本向学校推销。梁山伯与祝英台的故事是我国优美的民间传说之一。但这本书内容，却充满陈词滥调，带有浓厚的封建迷信色彩。该书开头即是：“吟诗一首安神位，表起上方张玉尊，金童玉女降下界，夫妇三世不成婚”。后面又说祝英台的未婚夫马三郎死后至阎君面前泣诉，说梁山伯霸占其妻；阎君查其阳寿未终，放他还阳，并告诉他，梁山伯与祝英台是金童玉女，不能与凡人婚配等。出版儿童读物首先应考虑书籍内容对儿童的教育作用，翻印这样内容有错误的旧唱本是错误的。应该保护怀孕女演员的健康
    东北军区后勤政治部文工团丁帆来信：日前我在蛟河县城内看了蛟河县评剧团演出的“忠烈鸳鸯”。剧中饰某山寨寨主的女儿及饰某小卒的两个女演员，都是怀了孕的。饰寨主女儿的女演员的戏特别重，从头到尾差不多场场出台，除了唱戏做戏之外，还要与人对打，还要在台上翻鹞子、卧鱼、拖着枪旋转等。这个女演员在表演时虽然很卖力，但是因为戏很重，加之她又怀了孕，所以表演仍感困难，呼吸紧迫，动作也很迟缓，不但未收到应有的演出效果，反而使观众替她捏着一把汗。我认为让怀孕的女演员演出打得很激烈的武戏，是有损其健康的，希望能引起有关剧团足够的注意。
