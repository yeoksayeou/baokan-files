Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, June 1st: Technicians at the Kirov Factory in Leningrad, USSR, have recently proposed an initiative to promote advanced technical methods at every workstation. Technicians from the No. 10 Mechanical Workshop of the Kirov Factory, when proposing the initiative, guaranteed that this year they would use the promotion of advanced technical methods to help workers increase labor productivity by 35 percent, reduce product costs by 30 percent, and save 500,000 rubles in tool expenses, as well as a large amount of electricity and metal. The various advanced methods they have proposed during the movement have already achieved significant results. Technicians A. Annishi and foreman V. Mazanov, by revising the machining allowance (note: referring to the size of the workpiece before machining), have enabled the factory to save 27 tons of non-ferrous metals annually. Technician V. Smirnov proposed a rationalization suggestion that could save the factory 20 tons of steel annually. Technician I. Abigov adopted a device that allows seven six-sided parts to be cut simultaneously, whereas previously only two could be cut. Turner V. Karasev, in cooperation with technician O. Pavlov, adopted the Kolesov's tool operation method and Ryzhkov's vibration eliminator to finish many parts, which can increase labor productivity fourfold. Various workshops in the Kirov Factory have responded to the initiative to promote advanced technology at every workstation.

    创议在每个工作地点推行先进技术方法
    【新华社莫斯科一日电】列宁格勒基洛夫工厂的技术人员，最近提出了在每个工作地点推行先进技术方法的创议。基洛夫工厂第十号机械车间的技术人员在提出创议时，保证今年用推行先进技术方法，来帮助工人提高劳动生产率百分之三十五，减低产品成本百分之三十，节约工具费五十万卢布和大量电力和金属。他们在运动中提出的各种先进方法已获得了很大的成效。技师阿·安尼希和领班维·马扎诺夫由于改订了加工留量（按：指加工前制件的大小），使该厂一年节省二十七吨有色金属。技师维·斯米尔诺夫提出一件合理化建议，可以使该厂一年节省二十吨钢材。技师伊·阿比戈夫采用一种装置，使得同时可以削截七个六面的零件，而在以前只能削截两个。车工维·卡拉谢夫在技师奥·巴夫洛夫的合作下，采用了科列索夫的车刀工作法和雷日科夫的振动消除器来车光许多零件，可以使劳动生产率提高四倍。基洛夫工厂各个车间都响应了在每个工作地点推行先进技术的创议。
