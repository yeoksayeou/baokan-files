Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 3rd. The intense fighting on "Square Mountain," east of the North Han River on the Korean Eastern Front, has gradually subsided, and the smoke filling the valley is slowly dissipating.

In the past few days, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army soldiers on "Square Mountain" have crushed the enemy's frantic counterattacks in fierce battles and are actively constructing this newly captured position. They cleared the enemy corpses from the hilltop, repaired the collapsed fortifications, and cleaned the original enemy tunnels, spreading newly captured blankets in the resting areas. At the same time, they also built new fortifications according to the needs of the battle.

At certain times, cooks deliver meals to the tunnels, as well as mooncakes, candies, and other foods. Even during the intense fighting, the soldiers can receive pineapple, snow pear, and other canned fruits, and fresh apples specially sent by the command to quench their thirst. These items come from Jilin in Northeast China, Yantai in Shandong, and distant Shanghai and Guangzhou. Many books, newspapers, and recreational equipment have also been sent to the forward fortifications along with large quantities of ammunition.

Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 3rd. The Chinese People's Volunteer Army received warm support from the Korean people in the battle on the "Square Mountain" position on the Eastern Front. After the battle to counterattack "Square Mountain" began on the night of May 27th, the stretcher teams composed of Korean people from villages near the front line disregarded the enemy's air and artillery blockade and rushed to the casualty transfer station overnight to bring the Volunteer Army wounded who had just been rescued from the battlefield safely to the rear. Some stretcher bearers were injured by enemy fire on the way, and another person immediately stepped up to replace them. Young women also carried stretchers in the dark, traversing mountains to transport the wounded. In order to shorten the transfer time and reduce the suffering of the wounded, the repair teams, braving enemy air raids, repaired a small road from the casualty transfer station to the casualty receiving station in one day.

During the battle, many Korean people went to the Volunteer Army casualty receiving station to check blood types and requested to donate blood to the wounded Volunteer Army soldiers. Korean young women Kim Gye-jung and Kwon Myung-gwi rushed to transfuse 200cc of fresh blood to a critically injured soldier.

Korean women near the war zone set up many comfort stations along the roads where the wounded passed. As soon as the stretchers carrying the wounded stopped, two Korean women would bring warm water to wipe the faces and hands of the wounded, and then present them with flowers of glory. Korean woman Kang Bok-gui took out honey she had saved since 1951 to cook rice porridge for the wounded soldiers, and Li Bok-gui and Kim Yeon-ok, family members of Korean People's Army soldiers, cooked a lot of yeast sugar, packed it in small paper bags, and sent it to the wounded Volunteer Army soldiers. Li Chun-nyeo, a member of the Democratic Women's League, wrote words of gratitude in both Korean and Chinese on her beloved red silk handkerchief and gave it to Wang Zhenxing, a young Volunteer Army soldier who had performed meritorious service in killing the enemy and had been wounded in his left eye.

    我军战士在“方形山”上积极修建新阵地
    朝鲜人民热烈支援我军反击“方形山”的战斗
    【新华社朝鲜前线三日电】朝鲜东线北汉江以东“方形山”上，激烈的战斗渐渐和缓下来，弥漫在山谷中的硝烟正渐渐消散。
    几天来，“方形山”上的中国人民志愿军战士在激烈的争夺战中，粉碎了敌人的疯狂反扑，并积极修建这座新攻占的阵地。他们清除了山头上的敌军尸体，修好了炸塌的工事并把原来敌人的坑道打扫干净，在休息的地方铺上新缴获的毛毯。同时，他们还按照战斗的需要修建了新的工事。
    在一定的时候，炊事员把饭菜送到坑道里，另外还有月饼、糖果等食品。就是在激烈的战斗中，战士们也能得到指挥机关特地送来的菠萝、雪梨等水果罐头和鲜苹果来解渴。这些东西来自祖国东北的吉林、山东的烟台和遥远的上海和广州。许多书报和文娱器具也已伴随着大量的弹药送到前沿工事。
    【新华社朝鲜前线三日电】中国人民志愿军在东线“方形山”阵地作战中，得到朝鲜人民的热烈支援。五月二十七日夜间，我军反击“方形山”的战斗开始后，接近前线的各村朝鲜人民组成的担架队，就不顾敌机敌炮的封锁，连夜赶到伤员转运站集合，把刚从战场上抢救下来的志愿军伤员安全地送到后方去。有的担架队员在路上被敌人的炮火打伤了，另一个人就马上走上来接替他。年青的妇女们也在黑夜里抬着担架，翻过大山运送伤员。抢修队员们为了缩短转运时间，减少伤员的痛苦，也冒着敌机袭扰，在一天内修好了一条从伤员转运站通到伤员收容所去的小路。
    在战斗中，许多朝鲜人民都到志愿军伤员收容所去检验血型，要求给志愿军伤员输血。朝鲜青年妇女金桂仲、权明贵抢着给一个伤势危急的重伤员输了二百西西鲜血。
    战区附近的朝鲜妇女们在伤员经过的路上设立了许多慰问站，从这里过路的抬着伤员的担架刚一停放，就有两个朝鲜妇女端来温水，给伤员擦脸、洗手，然后献上光荣花。朝鲜妇女姜福贵拿出从一九五一年保存到现在的蜂蜜为伤员熬米汁，朝鲜人民军战士家属李福贵、金莲玉熬了很多酵糖，装在小纸袋里送给志愿军伤员吃。民主妇女同盟盟员李春女在自己心爱的红绸手帕上用朝中两国文字写了感激词，赠给一位杀敌有功、左眼负了伤的志愿军青年战士王振兴。
