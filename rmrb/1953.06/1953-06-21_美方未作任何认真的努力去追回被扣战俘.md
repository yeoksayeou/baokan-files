Title: US Side Made No Serious Effort to Recover Detained POWs

Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, June 20th: Special Correspondent Jiang Nan reports: The US negotiating representative, Harrison, said in his letter to the Korean-Chinese side on the 18th that the US side "is making every effort to recover" the detained prisoners of war. However, one can only judge the value of Harrison's words based on the actions of the US side.

The fact is that the US side has so far made no serious effort to recover the more than 25,000 prisoners of war abducted by the Lee Seung-man bandit gang. Lee Seung-man's military police are escorting prisoners of war, formed into small teams of more than ten people, openly into cities such as Busan in front of American military police. They change the prisoners of war into civilian clothes, issue them "identity cards" and "citizenship certificates," and then force them to report to Lee Seung-man's military training centers according to "military conscription orders." An International News Service dispatch from Busan on the 19th stated that US military police jeeps slowly drove past a group of prisoners of war being escorted away by the Lee Seung-man bandit gang on a main street, fifty feet away, "but the US military police were ordered not to interfere with any escaping prisoners of war."

Some American patrols are merely putting on a show, conducting futile searches near the prisoner of war camps, even though they clearly know that these prisoners of war are no longer near the camps. According to an Associated Press reporter in Seoul on the 20th, "American patrols today are half-heartedly searching for 26,000 missing prisoners of war." Moreover, the US side not only has not recovered those prisoners of war, but also on the 20th, it condoned the Lee Seung-man bandit gang continuing to escort prisoners of war from the prisoner of war camps. Just on the evening of the 19th and the morning of the 20th, another 45 prisoners of war were forced away from the prisoner of war camps by the Lee Seung-man bandit gang. This is the third consecutive day that the same incident has occurred. In an American officers' mess in Busan, more than ten prisoners of war were also taken away by the Lee Seung-man bandit gang, and two American guards did not attempt to stop them at all.

What should be alarming to world public opinion is that the US side is releasing air, saying that it is impossible to recover those "released" prisoners of war. The United Press International correspondent in Seoul, who has always been known for spreading rumors to confuse the public on orders in the endeavor to sabotage the realization of the armistice, clamored on the 20th: to recover those prisoners of war "is as difficult as finding a snowball in hell." However, even the United Press International reporter himself knows that he does not have to go to hell to find these detained prisoners of war. The Lee Seung-man bandit gang now openly allows American reporters to visit the escorted prisoners of war under the supervision of South Korean guards. The United Press International correspondent in Busan reported such a visit on the 18th. The question is whether the US side, as Harrison said, is going to recover these prisoners of war from the Lee Seung-man bandit gang. According to an International News Service dispatch from Busan on the 19th, a senior spokesman for the US prisoner of war camp command said that the US Far East Command "has been notified not to order in-depth search operations."

From these signs, does the US side think that it cannot control the Lee Seung-man group? Does it think that the Korean armistice does not include the Lee Seung-man puppet army? Does it think that the Lee Seung-man group can be free from any agreement, and therefore this group that is deliberately continuing the war can also be free from any restrictions? If the US government thinks so, it should announce this publicly.

### 美方未作任何认真的努力去追回被扣战俘

    美方未作任何认真的努力去追回被扣战俘
    【新华社开城二十日电】本社特派记者江南报道：美方谈判代表哈利逊在他十八日给朝中方面的信中说：美方“正在尽力追回”已被扣留的战俘。但是，人们只能从美方的行动来判断哈利逊这句话究竟有多少价值。
    事实是，美方迄今为止并没有作任何认真的努力去追回那二万五千多被李承晚匪帮绑架去的战俘。李承晚的军事警察正在押着编成十多个人一小队的战俘，堂而皇之地当着美国宪兵的面走进釜山等城市。他们给战俘换上平民服装，发给他们“身份证”和“公民证”，然后强迫他们按照“军事征召令”到李承晚的军事训练中心去报到。国际新闻社十九日从釜山发的一条消息说，美国宪兵的吉普车从一条大街上离开被李承晚匪帮押走的一批战俘五十呎以外缓缓开过，“但是美国宪兵奉命不得干涉任何逃跑的战俘”。
    有些美国巡逻兵只是装腔作势地在战俘营附近的地方进行徒然的搜索，虽然他们明明知道这些战俘早已不在战俘营附近。据美联社记者二十日自汉城报道，“美国巡逻兵今天半心半意地在搜索二万六千名失踪的战俘”。而且，美方不仅没有把那些战俘追回，而且在二十日又纵容李承晚匪帮继续从俘虏营中押走战俘。就在十九日晚上和二十日早上，又有四十五名战俘被李承晚匪帮从战俘营中逼走，这是接连第三天发生同样的事件了。在釜山一个美国军官餐厅中也有十多名战俘被李承晚匪帮带走，两个美国卫兵根本没有试图去阻止他们。
    值得世界舆论警惕的是，美方正放出空气，说什么追回那些被“释放”了的战俘是不可能的。向来在破坏停战实现的勾当上以奉命造谣惑众著名的合众社驻汉城记者，在二十日就扬言：要想追回那些战俘“真像要想在地狱里找一个雪球那样困难”。但是，就是合众社的记者自己也知道，他用不着下地狱就可以找到这些被扣留的战俘。李承晚匪帮现在公开容许美国记者访问在南朝鲜卫兵监视下的被押走的战俘，合众社驻釜山的记者在十八日就曾经报道过这种访问。问题在于美方是不是像哈利逊说的那样，去向李承晚匪帮追回这些战俘。据国际新闻社十九日从釜山发的一条消息说，美方战俘营司令部的一个高级发言人说，美军远东司令部“已经接到通知，不叫它下令进行深入的搜捕运动”。
    从这些迹象看来，美方是不是认为它无法控制李承晚集团呢？是不是认为朝鲜停战并不包括李承晚伪军呢？是不是认为李承晚集团可以不受任何协议约束因而对这个蓄意继续战争的集团也可以不受任何约束呢？如果美国政府认为是这样，它就应该公开宣布这点。
