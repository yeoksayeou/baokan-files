How Did Cadres in Xinxiang Special District Learn Agricultural Technology?
Yang Huiren, Head of the Agricultural Technology Guidance Station, Xinxiang Special District, Henan Province

The primary task of current rural work is to overcome natural disasters and increase grain production. Rural work cadres, in order to lead agricultural production, must learn basic agricultural techniques in addition to studying policies.

In learning agricultural techniques, cadres often face two kinds of ideological obstacles: One is to view agricultural technology as too mysterious, believing that they have not attended agricultural schools and do not understand "nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium" or "666," and are completely ignorant of "careful selection of improved varieties" and "rational irrigation." Therefore, when encountering difficulties, they ask their superiors for solutions and cannot help farmers solve specific problems. Farmers' attitude towards the cadres is cold, and the cadres themselves are also very distressed. The other is to belittle agricultural technology, believing that "farming doesn't need to be learned," and "as long as the political awareness of the masses is raised, they will naturally be active in farming, without needing to guide them technically." However, constantly shouting empty political slogans to the masses cannot solve the specific problem of how to further increase production, and thus they become detached from the masses, and also feel distressed.

How should rural work cadres learn agricultural production techniques and achieve specific leadership in production? The Xinxiang Special District in Henan Province has explored the following experiences over the past three years:

Go Deep into the Masses and Fields, and Conduct Hard and Detailed Investigation and Research

Rural work cadres should have a high degree of enthusiasm for leading agricultural production and helping farmers produce more grain; they should conduct investigation and research by going deep into the masses and fields during each agricultural season. The Xinxiang Special District began mobilizing farmers to select wheat seeds in 1950. That year, wheat stripe rust was very serious, and the masses said, "Why select seeds when they are jaundiced?" They believed that "what is sown in the ground is harvested by heaven," and "crops are a matter of luck, relying entirely on chance." At that time, the leading comrades of the Special District called on cadres to help the masses select and retain varieties with high yield and strong resistance to rust. At that time, most cadres still did not pay attention to this issue and did not know how to start, nor did they recognize what a good variety was. Some cadres who went deep into the fields to conduct investigation and research better led the seed selection work. Dang Fachun, the director of the Wuzhi County Farm, visited the fields in various districts before the wheat harvest, asked the masses which wheat was the best, and specifically compared the size of the ears and the severity of diseases. The results of the investigation showed that "Tiebazhi" wheat (the "Pingyuan 50 Wheat" widely promoted locally now) and "124 Wheat" from Kaifeng, as well as "Zhuganqing" and "Ermang Wheat," had high yields and light diseases. He consulted with the farmers and carried out field seed selection. After continuous evaluation, breeding, and promotion in 1950 and 1951, by 1952, the area of improved variety wheat fields in the county reached 60% of the total wheat field area, and the total output increased by 25% compared with 1951. Now, the farmers in Wuzhi County deeply feel that "seed selection is a major event." Other counties such as Huojia, Wenxian, and Qinyang have also seen such cadres. Lang Erhu (former director of Huojia County Farm) and Hou Gaoliang (former director of the county construction section) in Huojia County had never even seen cotton fields before, let alone cotton cultivation techniques. At that time, there was not a single agricultural technician in the county, and the farm only had one promoter, Sun Guisheng, a middle school student who only started working after liberation and was even more of a layman in technology. However, because the county leaders attached importance to agricultural technology guidance, they guided them to learn from the farmers and to observe and study in the fields. In just two years, they all understood general agricultural knowledge and learned techniques such as cotton pruning.

Learn from Labor Models' High-Yield Experiences on the One Hand, and Learn Scientific Knowledge from Technical Personnel on the Other

Learning from labor models and summarizing their high-yield experiences is one of the important methods of learning production technology. In the past, most rural work cadres in the Xinxiang Special District lacked methods for how to rationally irrigate and fertilize wheat, and how to increase yields in dry land; therefore, they could not put forward specific plans for leading wheat high-yield, and could only vaguely call for "deep plowing and careful cultivation," "heavy fertilizer and frequent watering," and "dense planting." Farmers said, "Wheat will lodge with too much fertilizer," "Dry land can only wait for rain," "Watering will result in sterile grains," and "Dense planting is afraid of poor ventilation and easy to get jaundice." The cadres were unable to answer. Later, after summarizing the experiences of local high-yield models, everyone had a way to answer the farmers' questions. They compared the wheat high-yield experiences of labor models such as Guo Jianwen in Wuzhi County, and summarized the wheat field management experience of "timely, appropriate amount, three fertilizations, and five waterings," which had good promotion effects. This broke the cadres' distress of not being able to lead the masses in wheat cultivation.

In the past two years, counties in the Xinxiang Special District have also invited high-yield labor models to give lectures to cadres, turning many cadres who were laymen in agricultural production into experts. Zhang Tushu, a high-yield millet model in Wenxian County, and Ma Yingxuan, a high-yield cotton model in Huojia County, have given many reports at civil schools and expanded cadre meetings in the county. Cadres who listened to their reports said: Listening to a lecture from a labor model adds another method to leading production.

The experiences of labor models are sometimes fragmented and incomplete. Therefore, it is also necessary to learn from technical personnel. For example, no rural work cadre in the entire Special District recognized "blind weevils" (a kind of pest) on cotton in previous years; the masses called it "hemp leaf madness" and could not control it. Cadres in the Huojia County Construction Section were stumped by the farmers' questions, so they asked the technical cadres of the North China Scientific Research Institute, and then they understood that it was a pest and could be controlled by spraying "666 powder." A technical promoter at the Jiyuan County Farm found that he did not recognize wheat diseases and insect pests, so he wrote a letter, attached a specimen of the affected wheat, and inquired from the North China Scientific Research Institute, and the problem was also solved.

State-Owned Farms Should Become an Important Base for Technical Education for Cadres

State-owned farms have better production conditions and more accurate technology. They are the best places for cadres and the masses to learn technology. Xinxiang County is a cotton-producing area, with a total of 250,000 mu of cotton planted in the county. However, in the past, it has not been possible to implement cotton yield increase technology to the masses; not only did the masses not believe it, but even the district and village cadres said that Qu Yaoli's experience could not be applied to Xinxiang. They were afraid that dense planting would lead to crazy growth, and believed that cotton fields should not be heavily fertilized. In 1952, county leading cadres guided the farm to create experience in cotton sowing, thinning, pruning, fertilization, and watering. In each season, they mobilized cadres from the entire county to visit the farm's cotton field management. At the beginning, some people saw that the cotton was planted at 3,600 plants per mu, thinking it was too dense, saying "the seedlings are good" but fearing that they would not produce bolls. During the third visit in the autumn, everyone saw that the cotton bolls were growing abundantly and large, and the conservative idea of not wanting dense planting was broken. The county leading cadres believed that the farm's high-yield demonstration had great educational significance for cadres and the masses. After the farm's cotton achieved a high yield (receiving 470 jin per mu), the high-yield experience was printed into a booklet for cadres throughout the county to study. There are many similar examples in other counties. For example, the comparative trial of eight wheat varieties on the Jiyuan County Farm, the cotton and grain high-yield trials on the Wuzhi and Huojia County Farms, and the technical improvement of composting straw into manure have all become good learning materials for cadres throughout the county. After the cadres in Xiuwu County learned the method of using arsenic to kill insects from the farm, they conducted typical experiments among the farmers. The farmers saw the actual effect of arsenic in pest control with their own eyes, and automatically requested to buy medicine to control pests. The entire village of Xizi, with 610 mu of wheat land, universally applied medicine to control insects once, and as a result, no insect pests occurred.

Combine the Advanced Experience and Scientific Theory Learned with the Local Reality

In the past two or three years, the Xinxiang Special District has also organized the vast number of rural work cadres to systematically study the Soviet wheat cultivation experience introduced by Soviet expert Lysenko, Qu Yaoli's cotton high-yield experience, the trial outline for high-yield wheat cultivation issued by the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government, and Guo Jianwen's wheat high-yield experience in Wuzhi County, through methods such as running agricultural technology training courses. In the process of learning, closely linking with reality and paying attention to solving the problems in current practical work, the effect was great, and everyone's technical knowledge level has been improved. After the cadres of the Wuzhi County Farm studied the theory of dense wheat planting, they studied with several old farmers the issue of whether dense planting could be promoted. At the beginning, some people were skeptical about dense planting. Labor model Lian Yongfu said that Lian Zhuyi in his village used to have four mu of wheat fields, sowing 18 jin per mu, and one year the average yield was over 1,000 jin per mu. Other farmers introduced the experience of obtaining high yields from densely sown vegetable gardens in small plots. Everyone compared these facts with the theory they had learned, and more accurately understood the principle that dense planting can increase production, and had the confidence to learn dense planting. The cadres and farmers conducted research in this way in connection with reality, had a better understanding in their hearts, and promoted the experience of dense wheat planting to the masses by using the facts of dense planting and high yield that already existed among the masses. Last year, many farmers in the county modified 300 broad drills, changing the 7-inch row spacing to 4.5 to 5 inches. Densely planted wheat accounted for about 30% of the total wheat planting area in the county.

    新乡专区干部是怎样学习农业技术的
    河南省新乡专区农业技术指导站站长  杨惠人
    当前农村工作的首要任务就是战胜自然灾害，增产粮食。农村工作干部要领导农业生产，除了学习政策之外，还必须学习普通的农业技术。
    干部在学习农业技术当中，往往有这样两种思想障碍：一种是把农业技术看得太神秘，认为自己没有进过农业学校，既不懂“氮、磷、钾”，又不懂“六六六”，什么“精选良种”、“合理灌溉”也一窍不通。因此，一碰到困难就向上级要办法，不能帮助农民解决具体问题。农民对干部的态度冷淡，干部自己也很苦闷。另一种是轻视农业技术，认为“庄稼活不用学”，“只要群众政治觉悟提高了，自然会积极种地，用不着从技术上指导他们。”但是，老是向群众喊空洞的政治口号，不能解决怎样进一步增加生产的具体问题，也就脱离了群众，于是也苦闷起来。
    农村工作干部究竟应该怎样学习农业生产技术，并实现对生产的具体领导呢？河南省新乡专区三年来摸索到这样一些经验：
    深入群众深入田间，艰苦细致地进行调查研究
    农村工作干部对于领导农业生产、帮助农民多打粮食，要有高度的热情；要在各个农事季节里，深入群众、深入田间进行调查研究。新乡专区在一九五○年开始发动农民选麦种，那一年麦子黄锈病很严重，群众说：“黄疽了还选什么种？”他们认为
    “种在地，收在天”，“庄稼是撞稼，全靠撞运气”。专区领导同志当时就号召干部帮助群众选留产量大且抗锈力强的品种。当时，多数干部仍然不注意这个问题，也不知道应该怎样下手，不认识什么是良种。有些干部深入田间进行了调查研究，就较好地领导了选种工作。武陟县农场场长党发春，在麦收前就到各区进行田间参观，向群众访问那一种麦子最好，具体比较麦穗大小和病害轻重。调查的结果，发现“铁巴枝”小麦（即现在当地普遍推广的“平原五○麦”）和开封“一二四小麦”及“竹竿青”、“二芒麦”等几种麦子的产量大、病害轻。他就和农民商量，开展了田间选种工作。经过一九五○年和一九五一年的连续评选和繁殖、推广，到了一九五二年，全县采用良种麦田面积就达到了麦田总面积的百分之六十，总产量比一九五一年增加了百分之二十五。现在武陟县农民已深切感到“选种是件大事”。其它如获嘉、温县、沁阳等县，都出现了这样的干部。获嘉县郎二虎同志（前任县农场场长）、侯高亮同志（前县建设科长），过去连棉田都没见过，更不用说棉花栽培技术了。当时，全县没有一个农业技术员，农场只有一个推广员孙桂生，是个中学生，在当地解放后才参加工作，对技术更是外行。但由于县领导同志重视农业技术指导工作，指导他们深入农民中去学习，到田间去观察、钻研，仅两年时间，他们都懂得了一般的农业知识，学会了棉花整枝等技术。
    一方面向劳动模范学习丰产经验，一方面向技术人员学习科学知识
    向劳动模范学习，总结劳动模范的丰产经验，是学习生产技术的重要方法之一。新乡专区多数农村工作干部过去对于小麦如何合理浇水、合理施肥，旱地如何提高产量，都缺乏办法；因此对于领导小麦丰产提不出具体方案，只能笼统地号召“深耕细作”“粪大水勤”“密植”。农民说“小麦肥多要倒伏”，“旱地只能等下雨”、“浇水就要结粃籽”，“密植怕不透风，容易生黄疽”，干部也无从回答。后来总结了本地丰产模范的经验，大家就有办法回答农民的疑问了。他们把武陟县郭建文等劳动模范的小麦丰产经验进行比较，就总结出了“适时、适量、三肥、五水”的麦田管理经验，推广效果良好。这就打破了干部不会领导群众栽培小麦的苦闷。
    两年以来，新乡专区各县还请丰产劳动模范给干部上课，使很多对农业生产外行的干部变成内行。温县谷子丰产模范张图书、获嘉县棉花丰产模范马应选，在民校、在县扩大干部会上，都做过多次报告。听他们报告的干部说：听劳动模范讲一课，领导生产的办法就多一条。
    劳动模范的经验，有些是片断的、不完整的。因此，还必须向技术人员学习。例如棉花上的“盲桩象”（一种害虫），前几年全专区的农村工作干部谁也不认识；群众说是“麻叶疯”，无法防治。获嘉县建设科干部被农民问住了，便向华北科学研究所的技术干部询问，以后就懂得了它是一种害虫，喷射“六六六粉”就可以防治。济源县农场一个技术推广员发现了小麦病虫害不认识，就写了一封信，附上受害小麦标本，向华北科学研究所询问，问题也解决了。
    国营农场要成为对干部进行技术教育的重要据点
    国营农场的生产条件较好，技术比较准确，它是干部和农民群众学习技术的最好场所。新乡县系棉产区，全县共种植棉花二十五万亩。但是过去一直不能把棉花的增产技术贯彻到群众中去；不但群众不相信，连区村干部也说曲耀离的经验不能运用到新乡。他们怕密植了会长疯，认为棉田不能多上肥。一九五二年，县领导干部指导农场先在棉花播种、间苗、整枝、施肥、浇水等方面创造经验。在每个季节，都发动全县干部到农场去参观棉花的田间管理。开始，有的人看棉花每亩种了三千六百株，认为过稠了，嘴里说“苗不错”，心里却怕不结桃。在秋季第三次参观时，大家看见了棉桃长得又多又大，不愿密植的保守思想就打破了。县领导干部认为农场的丰产示范对干部和群众教育意义很大，在农场的棉花获得丰产以后（每亩收到四百七十斤），就把丰产经验印成小册子供全县干部学习。其他各县这类例子也很多。如济源县农场的八个小麦品种的比较试验，武陟、获嘉县农场的棉粮丰产试验，及庄稼稭沤粪的技术改良等，都成为全县干部的很好的学习材料。修武县干部从农场学习了用砒霜杀虫的办法以后，就在农民中进行典型试验。农民们亲眼看到砒霜治虫的实效，便自动要求买药治虫。西子村全村六百一十亩麦地普遍用药治虫一遍，结果就没有发生一点虫害。
    把学到的先进经验和科学理论和当地的实际结合起来
    新乡专区在两三年来，还通过举办农业技术训练班等办法，组织广大农村工作干部比较系统地学习了苏联专家卢森科所介绍的苏联小麦栽培经验、曲耀离的棉花丰产经验、中央人民政府农业部颁发的小麦丰产栽培试行纲要、武陟县郭建文的小麦丰产经验。在学习过程中，密切地联系实际，注意解决当前实际工作中的问题，收效很大，使大家的技术知识水平都提高了一步。武陟县农场干部学习了小麦密植理论后，就同几个老农研究密植能不能推广的问题。开始，有些人对密植半信半疑。劳动模范连永福说，他村连朱娃过去有四亩麦田，每亩下种十八斤，有一年每亩平均收麦千斤以上。又有别的农民介绍了小块菜园密植撒播获得丰产的经验。大家把这些事实和学到的理论一对照，就更确切地明白了密植可以增产的道理，都有了学习密植的信心。干部和农民这样联系实际进行研究，心中更有了数，便用群众中已有的密植丰产的事实向群众推广小麦密植经验。去年，全县就有不少农民把宽耧改修了三百张，把七寸行距改为四寸半至五寸，全县密植小麦约占小麦播种总面积的百分之三十。
