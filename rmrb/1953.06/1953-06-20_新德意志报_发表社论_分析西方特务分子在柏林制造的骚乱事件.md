Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, June 19th: According to TASS, Berlin, June 19th, "Neues Deutschland" published an editorial on June 18th titled "What Happened in Berlin?" stating that the direct cause of the Berlin riots is inseparable from the recent developments in the German Democratic Republic. The government's announcement of new measures had an effect within hours. This alarmed the warmongers in West Germany and West Berlin, so they hastily carried out this extreme act of provocation.

The editorial analyzes the situation, saying: The government of the German Democratic Republic is taking many measures to relax the inter-zone pass system, help private enterprises and private businesses, and give escaped wealthy farmers the opportunity to return to their estates. At a time like this, fascist spies sent tens of thousands of provocateurs, attempting to obstruct the work of the government of the German Democratic Republic at all costs. They took advantage of the relaxed traffic between East and West Berlin to organize large numbers of bad elements to enter the democratic zone.

Anyone who analyzes these facts will see the essence of the problem. Of course, this is not a production quota issue. When the government made a decision and satisfactorily resolved the production quota issue, things became very clear. It was precisely at this moment that the provocateurs began their provocative actions.

Western spies are doing their best to obstruct the large-scale construction underway in the German Democratic Republic. They want to undermine the unity of Germany, which has made considerable progress due to the measures taken by our government. They want to preserve Adenauer's and the American military policies that are suffering even more obvious defeats at all costs, and they want to shamelessly strike at the vital interests of the German people.

For this purpose, American officers appeared in full uniform in the democratic zone and in the demonstration lines of fascist spies, directing activities that incited popular unrest. For this purpose, American cars equipped with radios were specially driven to provide fascist spies with various instructions. For this purpose, American planes flew over the democratic zone and dropped leaflets calling for continued strikes. This provocation ultimately failed. They caused some enterprises to shut down, they created a few hours of chaos, and they incited unrest among some people, but the vast majority of the people were not only not incited, but also hated this incitement.

It is precisely for this reason that it can now be said that this major provocation, which was prepared for a long time by Western spies and carried out using their entire machine, has failed, and this will have far-reaching implications.

The editorial continued: The provocation was a complete failure because the forces of peace will not allow the people, including our German people, to be dragged onto the road to war. However, it is shameful that the German working people allowed themselves to be influenced by the West German provocateurs, who are not difficult to see through, and that the workers of Berlin did not stop this insult to their city themselves, but rather the occupying authorities took martial law measures and protected the vital interests of the German people and the people of the world with the necessary courage.

Indeed, the working-class parties must seriously consider how such a thing could have happened. How could a portion of the Berlin working class (who are undoubtedly all good and honest people) have been affected by a sense of distrust? How could this portion of the working people have been unaware that they were being used by fascist forces? Undoubtedly, our party has serious shortcomings here. Our party must better learn to respect the masses, unite them, and care about their daily lives. There is no doubt that, relying on relentless criticism and self-criticism, the Socialist Unity Party of Germany can cope with this task.

### “新德意志报”发表社论  分析西方特务分子在柏林制造的骚乱事件

    “新德意志报”发表社论
    分析西方特务分子在柏林制造的骚乱事件
    【新华社十九日讯】据塔斯社柏林十九日讯：六月十八日，“新德意志报”以“柏林发生了什么事情？”为题发表社论说：柏林骚乱的直接原因与德意志民主共和国最近的局势发展是分不开的。在政府公布了新措施几小时后，这些措施就已经发生了效果。这使得西德和西柏林的战争贩子感到惊慌，所以他们急忙进行这次极端的挑拨行动。
    社论分析事件的情况说：德意志民主共和国政府正在采取许多措施，放松区际通行证的制度，帮助私人企业和私人商业，给予逃亡的富有农民回到自己庄园的机会，在这样的时候，法西斯特务分子派来了成千上万的挑拨者，企图不惜任何代价阻挠德意志民主共和国政府的工作。他们利用东西柏林之间交通放宽的机会，组织坏分子大批进入民主区。
    任何人只要分析这些事实，就会看出问题的本质。当然这不是一个生产定额问题。在政府作出决定，圆满地解决了生产定额问题的时候，事情变得十分明显，正是在这个时刻，挑衅分子开始了他们的挑衅行动。
    西方特务分子尽力要想阻挠德意志民主共和国内进行的大规模建设。他们要破坏由于我们政府采取的措施，已有相当进展的德国的团结。他们要不惜一切代价，保留阿登纳和正遭受更明显的挫败的美国人的军事政策，他们要卑鄙无耻地打击德国人民的切身利益。
    为了这个目的，美国军官们穿着全副军装出现在民主区和法西斯特务的示威队伍中，指挥煽动人民骚乱的活动。为了这个目的，装有无线电的美国汽车特地开来给予法西斯特务种种指示。为了这个目的，美国飞机飞到民主区上空，并且撒下号召继续进行罢工的传单。这种挑衅终于失败了。他们使得一些企业停工，他们制造了几小时的混乱，并且煽动了一部分人民的骚乱，但是绝大多数人民不但没有受煽动，而且仇恨这种煽动。
    正是为了这个缘故，现在可以说，西方特务所准备已久并且利用了他们整套的机器来进行的这种大挑衅已经失败了，这将有深远的影响。
    社论继续说：挑衅是彻底失败了，因为和平的力量不让人民、包括我们德国人民在内，被拖到战争的道路上去。但是，德国劳动人民竟让他们自己受那些并不难看穿的西德挑拨者的影响，柏林的工人不能自己来制止这种对他们的城市的污辱而只是占领当局采取了戒严办法，以必要的魄力才保护了德国人民及全世界人民的切身利益，这是可耻的。
    的确，工人阶级政党必须严重地思考一下，这样的事情怎么竟能发生？怎么柏林工人阶级的一部分人（他们无疑全是善良的正直人）竟会受到不信任的情绪的影响？怎么这一部分劳动人民竟会不觉察到他们是受了法西斯力量的利用？无疑，我们的党在这里有着严重的缺点。我们党必须更好地学习尊重群众，团结他们，关心他们每天的生活，毫无疑问，依靠着不容情的批评与自我批评，德国统一社会党是可以应付这一任务的。
