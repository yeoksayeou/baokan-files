Xinhua News Agency, Berlin dispatch: West German monopoly capital is rapidly restoring its former position in the world market.

West German capital is expanding in countries that have long benefited Britain.

The Henschel company of Kassel has established an automobile manufacturing plant in South Africa. The Henkel Aircraft Company has established a factory there to manufacture diesel motorcycles and aircraft. Ruhr-Hehlen, Krupp, and Duisburg's Leygen joint-stock companies, Bremen's Borgward Automobile Company, Siemens United Factories, and other West German enterprises have infiltrated South Africa.

The Latin American market is a special target for West German monopoly capital in its foreign trade expansion. West German exports to Latin America are increasing rapidly. Since 1949, they have increased tenfold. In 1951, West German exports ranked third in Latin America.

Due to West German competition, British export capital is continuously losing markets.

Paris' "Le Monde" reported that West German monopoly capital has established a widespread network of institutions in South America, systematically monitoring the fluctuations of the Argentine market, and reporting first-hand information on the prices of goods offered to Argentina by other countries to the Foreign Trade Department in Bonn. Based on these materials, German merchants intentionally accept some losses in pricing in order to obtain more orders.

West German industrialists are undertaking large-scale construction in many Latin American countries. Mannesmann is building a steel factory in Brazil with an annual output of 250,000 tons of steel. Krupp Locomotive Manufacturing Factory now has a basic capital of five million US dollars in Sao Paulo. German Electrical Company and Siemens-Schuckert Electrical Pottery Factory are currently building a 30 million US dollar power plant in San Nicolas, Argentina. Daimler-Benz joint-stock company has branches in Brazil and Argentina. Borgward joint-stock automobile company has enterprises in Argentina and Brazil.

West Germany is striving to get rid of American "guardianship" as quickly as possible. The Dusseldorf weekly "Forward" recently wrote: "Germany must strengthen its power within the European Defense Group and use all economic and political means to get rid of American financial and political guardianship."

In terms of export volume to Latin America, West Germany has surpassed France and is catching up with Britain. In many cases, German goods have excluded American goods. "The New York Times" wrote in March 1952: The revived German industry has become America's most dangerous rival in the Latin American market.

West German industrialists are making every effort to expand trade with Colombia, Uruguay, Brazil, and other South American countries.

Special banks and lending institutions that were established with the support of the American occupation authorities and are partially funded to conduct foreign trade have played an important role in expanding West German foreign trade and exporting capital. These banks include the Export Loan Bank, which opened in Frankfurt am Main in the spring of 1952, and the Schacht-Ludewig Bank, opened by war criminal Schacht in Hamburg in early 1953, and the Schacht United Bank, opened in Dusseldorf.

Bank capital is rapidly infiltrating Latin American countries. Deutsche-Sudamerikanische Bank has reopened branches in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and Mexico.

    西德垄断资本和英、美、法等国争夺市场
    【新华社十五日讯】据塔斯社柏林讯：西德垄断资本正迅速恢复它们昔日在世界市场上的地位。
    西德资本正在长久以来一直使英国获利的国家中扩张。
    卡塞尔地方的汉舍尔公司已在南非建立了一个汽车制造厂。亨克尔飞机公司已在该地建立了一个工厂制造柴油摩托和飞机。鲁尔·海伦、克虏伯和杜伊斯堡的莱根这几个合股公司、不来梅地方的包尔格瓦德汽车公司、西门子联合工厂和其它西德企业已经渗入了南非。
    拉丁美洲市场是西德垄断资本在对外贸易扩张方面的一个特别目标。西德向拉丁美洲的输出量正迅速增加。自一九四九年以来，已经增加了十倍。在一九五一年，西德输出量在拉丁美洲占第三位。
    由于西德的竞争，英国的输出资本正接连地丧失市场。
    巴黎“世界报”报道说：西德垄断资本已在南美建立了一个密布各地的机构网，有计划地注视阿根廷市场的涨落，并把其它国家向阿根廷开列的货物价格的第一手情报报告波恩的对外贸易部。根据这些材料，德国商人作价时有意地吃一些亏，以便得到更多的订货。
    西德工业家正在许多拉丁美洲国家内进行大规模的建筑。麦尼斯曼公司正在巴西建造一个每年能出产二十五万吨钢铁的钢铁工厂。克虏伯机车制造工厂现在在圣保罗有基本资本五百万美元。德国电气总公司和西门子—舒克德电机陶器厂，现正在阿根廷的圣尼古拉建造一座价值三千万美元的电力厂。戴姆勒—本兹合股公司在巴西和阿根廷有分厂。包尔格瓦德合股汽车公司在阿根廷和巴西有企业。
    西德正在尽力尽速摆脱美国的“监护”。杜塞尔多夫的“前进”周刊最近写道：“德国必须加强它在欧洲防务集团内部的势力，并用一切经济和政治的办法来摆脱美国的财政和政治的监护。”
    在向拉丁美洲的出口量方面，西德已经超过了法国，并正赶上英国。在许多情况下，德国货排除了美国货。“纽约时报”在一九五二年三月写道：复活的德国工业已经成了美国在拉丁美洲市场上最危险的敌手。
    西德工业家正在尽力扩充与哥伦比亚、乌拉圭、巴西和其它南美国家的贸易。
    在美国占领当局的支持下成立半资助对外贸易的特别银行和贷款机构，在扩张西德对外贸易和输出资本方面发挥了重要作用。这些银行包括一九五二年春天在美因河上的法兰克福开办的出口贷款银行，以及一九五三年年初战犯沙赫特在汉堡开办的沙赫特—卢德韦希银行和在杜塞尔多夫开办的沙赫特联合银行。
    银行资本正迅速渗入拉丁美洲国家。德意志—南美银行在阿根廷、巴西、智利和墨西哥又再次开设了分行。
