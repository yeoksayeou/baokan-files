    Shandong Province Disaster Area Supply and Marketing Cooperatives
    Vigorously Develop Supply and Marketing Businesses to Support Disaster Victims' Production and Self-Salvation
    Since the beginning of spring, supply and marketing cooperatives at all levels in the disaster areas of Shandong Province have vigorously developed supply and marketing businesses to support disaster victims in production and self-salvation.
    Supply and marketing cooperatives at all levels in Shandong Province first actively helped disaster victims sell local and sideline products. Through internal exchange meetings between cooperatives, they organized cooperatives in non-disaster areas to purchase products from cooperative members in disaster areas; higher-level cooperatives actively tried to open up sales channels for local and sideline products purchased by grassroots cooperatives. According to statistics from thirty-one counties including Dongping and Liangshan from February to May alone, they sold thirty-two kinds of products from farmers, such as homespun cloth, reed mats, black bowls, eggs, wool, and scallions, worth more than 22.6 billion yuan. At the same time, supply and marketing cooperatives at all levels also promptly supplied farmers with a large number of means of production and daily necessities. According to incomplete statistics from January to April, the province has sold 22.98 million catties of chemical fertilizers, 293.7 million catties of cake fertilizer, 36.3 million catties of various miscellaneous fertilizers, 18,900 waterwheels, and 21,200 various new-style walking plows to farmers. Especially in some areas, after wheat and spring seedlings suffered from varying degrees of natural disasters such as frost, insects, and hail, cooperative cadres went deep into the countryside to organize farmers to rescue the affected crops and actively supplied pesticides. For example, after an insect plague occurred in Yexian County, the county federation and grassroots cooperatives organized more than 130 cadres to go to the countryside to guide farmers in using pesticides to eliminate the insect plague. As of May 20, the Shandong Provincial Cooperative General Office had allocated more than 300,000 catties of various pesticides and more than 27,000 sprayers to grassroots cooperatives in various places. Junan County has sold 715 catties of arsenic; the county used 666 powder to kill red spiders, and six districts rescued 1,580 mu of wheat from insect damage. Supply and marketing cooperatives in areas affected by insect plagues throughout the province are continuing to supply pesticides and pesticide machinery, and are organizing farmers to rescue affected crops.
    With the development of supply and marketing business, the cooperative also widely organized disaster victims to participate in processing, transportation and temporary short-term work to increase the living income of disaster victims. From January to April, Junan, Dongping, Yinan and other nine counties spent more than 1.28 billion yuan in wages for organizing disaster victims to transport salt, coal and grain for the cooperative. The cooperatives in five counties of Linyi Prefecture organized 27,585 disaster victims and 5,363 large and small vehicles to participate in transportation, enabling the disaster victims to earn 761.5 million yuan in wages, which can buy more than 1.16 million catties of coarse grains. Twelve grassroots cooperatives in Junan County organized 9,177 disaster victims to engage in transportation work in April and May, enabling the disaster victims to earn more than 130 million yuan in freight. Therefore, the disaster victims unanimously reflected: "With the help of the cooperative, we have the confidence to survive the famine."
    The basic reason for obtaining the above achievements is that most cooperatives, under the leadership of the local party committee, have deeply carried out the struggle against bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of laws and disciplines, improved the political consciousness of cadres, and clarified the policy of serving farmers' production. The cooperatives in the disaster area have even made disaster relief work the central task. However, some cooperatives still have serious bureaucracy and capitalist profit-seeking ideas in the work of selling local products in the disaster area, which should be corrected quickly.

    山东省灾区供销合作社
    大力开展供销业务扶持灾民生产自救
    山东省灾区各级供销合作社，入春以来，大力开展供销业务，扶持灾民生产自救。
    山东省各级供销合作社首先积极帮助灾民推销土产品和副产品。通过合作社之间的内部交流会，组织非灾区的合作社收购灾区合作社社员的产品；上级社积极设法为基层社收购的土产品和副产品打开销路。仅据东平、梁山等三十一个县在二月份到五月份的统计，即推销了农民的土布、苇席、黑碗、鸡蛋、羊毛、大葱等三十二种产品，价值二百二十六亿余元。同时，各级供销合作社还及时供应了农民大批生产资料和生活资料。据一月份至四月份不完全统计，全省已销售给农民化学肥料二千二百九十八万斤、饼肥二亿九千三百七十余万斤、各种杂肥三千六百三十余万斤、水车一万八千九百余部、各种新式步犁二万一千二百余部。特别在部分地区小麦、春苗遭受了不同程度的冻、虫、雹等自然灾害后，合作社干部都深入农村，组织农民抢救受灾作物，并积极地供应了农药。如掖县发生虫灾后，县联社、基层社即组织了一百三十余名干部下乡指导农民使用农药，消灭虫灾。山东省合作总社到五月二十日止，已调拨到各地基层社有各种农药三十余万斤、喷雾器二万七千余架。莒南县已销售信石七百一十五斤；该县用六六六药粉杀红蜘蛛，六个区即抢救受虫害小麦一千五百八十亩。全省各地发生虫灾地区的供销合作社，现正继续供应农药和农药器械，组织农民抢救受灾作物。
    随着供销业务的开展，合作社还广泛地组织灾民参加加工、运输和临时短工等工作，以增加灾民的生活收入。一月至四月，莒南、东平、沂南等九个县因组织灾民给合作社运盐、煤炭及粮食而支出的工资，达十二亿八千余万元。临沂专区五个县的合作社组织灾民二万七千五百八十五名、大小车五千三百六十三辆参加运输，使灾民获得工资七亿六千一百五十余万元，可买粗粮一百一十六万余斤。莒南县十二处基层社，在四、五月份组织了九千一百七十七名灾民从事运输工作，使灾民挣得运费一亿三千多万元。因此灾民一致反映：“有了合作社的帮助，我们渡荒就有信心了。”
    获得上述成就的基本原因，是大部合作社在当地党委的领导下，深入地开展了反官僚主义、命令主义、违法乱纪的斗争，提高了干部的政治觉悟，明确了为农民生产服务的方针，灾区的合作社更把生产救灾工作当成了中心工作。但有的合作社在推销灾区土产的工作中，还存在着严重的官僚主义和资本主义的营利思想，应该迅速改正。
