    Commemorating the 30th Anniversary of the Death of Bulgarian Revolutionary Poet Smirnenski
    Gao Shu
    Today is the 30th anniversary of the death of the outstanding Bulgarian revolutionary poet Smirnenski. Georgi Dimitrov, the great revolutionary leader of the Bulgarian people, said in 1948, during the 25th anniversary of the death of Bulgarian people's poet and revolutionary fighter Hristo Smirnenski: "It can be boldly said that, in terms of his combative and literary genius and nature, Smirnenski is our Bulgarian Mayakovsky." Although Smirnenski died at the young age of twenty-five, when his creative path had just begun, his passionate, fiery poetry and his resolute fighting spirit are still deeply rooted in the hearts of the Bulgarian people. As Vulko Chervenkov, the beloved leader of the Bulgarian working people, said: "In these twenty years, on the streets of towns and cities, in the fields, during strikes and demonstrations, in detention rooms, prisons, and concentration camps, in the Balkan Mountains, anti-fascist fighters sang Smirnenski's poems in order to struggle, to perform meritorious deeds, to endure the enemy's torture, and to die with composure. Smirnenski invisibly walked at the forefront of the victorious uprising of the working people on September 9, 1944. In our days, we feel that he is with us, that he lives with us like a talking, living person."
    The short life of Hristo Smirnenski (1898-1923) was full of struggle. When he was only a fifteen-year-old boy, the Greek army set fire to the city of Kukush, and Smirnenski's family, along with almost all the residents of the city, were forced to leave their homes. Some terrible scenes during the escape deeply impressed this sensitive young man with the suffering inflicted by foreign aggression and the tragedy of his homeland, which had become ruins. After a period of wandering, in the autumn of that year, Smirnenski entered a vocational school in Sofia. To help with the living expenses of his family of six, he sold newspapers after school. This studious young man read almost all the materials in the newspapers, and he paid great attention to the political events reported in the newspapers with great interest, which greatly broadened his horizons. The life of this period began to be reflected in a series of moving works by this future proletarian poet. He began to fight against the real society with his pen. In his early poems, he expressed his critical attitude towards reality; he exposed the rulers' cruel plunder of the working people. In his life after being drafted into the army, especially after experiencing the soldiers' uprising caused by the influence of the Great October Revolution and the unbearable conditions at the front, Smirnenski saw clearly the ugly face of the Bulgarian reactionary rule. After the Vladaya Uprising, he wrote a sharp political satire poem, exposing the traitorous policies of the Bulgarian bourgeois rulers.
    Political maturity and artistic maturity grew simultaneously in this young man. The impression of the Vladaya Uprising, the consolidation of the Soviet socialist state, the unprecedented upsurge of the working class revolutionary movement in Bulgaria and the world, and the strong activities of the Bulgarian Communist Party all played a decisive role in educating Smirnenski as a communist fighter. In 1920, Smirnenski joined the Communist Youth League, and the following year he joined the Bulgarian Communist Party.
    From this time until June 18, 1923, when tuberculosis took his young life, Smirnenski was fighting at all times. Communist ideas gave his great talent even more powerful wings. His fiery poems were filled with a communist optimism that had unwavering faith in the future happiness of the working people. He praised the great October Socialist Revolution; he praised the indestructible strength of the Soviet Union; he praised the victory of the German working class. Smirnenski became the most beloved poet of the broad working people of Bulgaria.
    As a poet, Smirnenski walked at the forefront of class struggle. The poet used his pen to sing praises of the proletarian revolutionary cause to which he was dedicated, encouraging millions to follow the banner of the Party and advance. At the same time, the noble qualities of the revolutionary enriched his poetry with rich content. In Bulgarian revolutionary literature, Smirnenski is the founder of Bulgarian proletarian, socialist realism poetry. He was also a remarkable and talented language artist with versatile creative talents. From his collection of poems "The Dawn is Coming!", we can see that he creatively and brilliantly developed the tradition of Dimitar Polyanov, the founder of Bulgarian literature. At the same time, his poems, like Hristo Botev's songs of the Bulgarian people's national liberation struggle against Turkish feudal oppression, sang about the revolutionary events of his time, and the powerful revolutionary upsurge of the working class around the world. Despite his early death, he left behind a rich literary heritage of different styles. All Bulgarian proletarian poets after Smirnenski learned from his high Party spirit and high artistic talent. Vulko Chervenkov said: "Smirnenski and Nikola Vaptsarov are, after Hristo Botev, the highest peaks reached by Bulgarian revolutionary poetry up to now."
    Smirnenski's Mayakovsky-style fighting revolutionary poems have been recited among the people of Bulgaria year after year. Especially in those difficult years of guerrilla warfare, no guerrilla fighter did not know Smirnenski's name, and no guerrilla fighter had not read his poems. At campfires in the dense forests and mountains, the fighters enthusiastically and movingly recited his poems full of fighting power, such as "Coal Miners", "Red Cavalry Regiment", "All of Us - Are People of Mother Earth", etc. These beautiful and moving poems were deeply instilled in the hearts of hundreds of thousands of guerrilla fighters, encouraging their fighting. In the cities, people excitedly read Smirnenski's dagger-like satirical poems from public or secret publications. These poems nakedly exposed the Bulgarian reactionary rule's cruel oppression of the working people and its traitorous policies, and also exposed and accused the imperialists' plundering conspiracies. All these poems have taken root, blossomed, and borne fruit forever in the hearts of the Bulgarian working people.
    Smirnenski gained such a lofty position in the hearts of the Bulgarian people not only because of the brilliant achievements of his revolutionary poems, but also because he was a great fighter and a loyal son of the Bulgarian working people. His noble qualities of loyalty to the people and loyalty to the Party have also become examples for the broad masses to learn from. He bravely participated in the Party's struggle, faithfully carried out the Party's tasks, and never refused any dangerous or arduous tasks. He protected the workers' demonstrations; he guarded the Party's club with a gun at night; during the election struggle, he was a tireless agitator. Smirnenski's ability to express the magnificent cause of the proletarian revolution with such convincing and moving images in art is inseparable from the fact that he himself was a witness and enthusiastic participant in the upsurge of the Bulgarian workers' movement. He was in the same Party group as Vulko Chervenkov, which gave him even more superior education. Vulko Chervenkov gave a very high evaluation of his life, saying:
    "Smirnenski was at the center of the political struggle, matching the tip of his fiery pen to a bayonet, a fighting bayonet, fighting shoulder to shoulder with his enslaved brothers."
    Today, as the Bulgarian people warmly commemorate the 30th anniversary of Smirnenski's death, the Bulgarian people have victoriously established their own people's republic and are confidently marching towards the road of socialism. Smirnenski's great revolutionary poetry, which once burned like a flame in the hearts of the Bulgarian people, will continue to be the force that inspires them to move forward; and with the upsurge of the worldwide movement to defend peace and oppose war, his fighting works will also be added to the treasure house of human progressive literature, and will be loved and recited by the working people of all countries.

    纪念保加利亚革命诗人斯米尔宁斯基逝世三十周年
    高澍
    今天是保加利亚出色的革命诗人斯米尔宁斯基逝世三十周年纪念日。保加利亚人民伟大的革命领袖季米特洛夫，在一九四八年纪念保加利亚人民诗人、革命斗士赫里斯托·斯米尔宁斯基逝世二十五周年时，曾说：“可以大胆地说，就其战斗的、文学创作的天才和性质说，斯米尔宁斯基是我们保加利亚的马雅可夫斯基。”斯米尔宁斯基虽然在仅仅二十五岁、他的创作道路刚刚开始的时候就去世了；可是，他的热情的、火焰般的诗歌和他的坚决的战斗精神，至今还是深深地留在保加利亚人民的心里。正像保加利亚劳动人民敬爱的领导者维·契尔文科夫所说的：“在这二十年中，在各城各镇的街道上，在田野上，在罢工和游行示威的时候，在禁闭室、监牢和集中营里，在巴尔干的群山中，反法西斯主义的战士们口里都唱着斯米尔宁斯基的诗歌，去斗争、去建立功勋、受敌人的拷刑和从容就义。斯米尔宁斯基不现形迹地走在一九四四年九月九日劳动人民胜利起义的最前列。在我们的日子里，我们感到他和我们在一起，感到他像会说话的活人一样，跟我们活在一起。”
    赫里斯托·斯米尔宁斯基（一八九八—一九二三）底短促的一生，是充满着战斗的。当他还只是十五岁的少年时，希腊军队放火烧毁库古斯城，斯米尔宁斯基一家和城中几乎所有的居民，都被迫离开家乡。逃亡途中的一些可怕景象，使这个敏感的少年人深刻地体验了异族侵略所给予的痛苦和那已经成为瓦砾的故乡的悲剧。经过一个时期的流浪之后，这一年秋天，斯米尔宁斯基进了索菲亚的职业学校。为了帮助六口之家的生活费，他在放学后就卖报。这个好学的青年人几乎读遍了报纸上所有的材料，他以很大的兴趣注意报纸上的那些政治事件，这些都大大地打开了他的眼界。这个时期的生活，开始反映到这位未来的无产阶级诗人
    一连串的、动人的作品中。他开始用笔和现实社会作斗争。在他早期的诗里，表现了他对现实的批判态度；他揭露了统治者对劳动人民的残忍掠夺。在被征入伍后的生活中，特别是经历了由于伟大的十月革命影响和前线不堪忍受的条件而引起的士兵的起义，使斯米尔宁斯基看清了保加利亚反动统治的丑恶面目。在勃拉达斯起义后，他写了一首尖锐的政治讽刺诗，揭露保加利亚资产阶级统治者的叛国政策。
    政治上的成熟和艺术上的成熟，在这个年青人身上同时增长着。勃拉达斯起义的印象，苏维埃社会主义国家的巩固，保加利亚及全世界工人阶级革命运动的空前高涨，保加利亚共产党强有力的活动，对教育斯米尔宁斯基作为一个共产主义战士，都起了决定性的作用。一九二○年，斯米尔宁斯基加入共产主义青年团，第二年就加入了保加利亚共产党。
    从这时起，直到一九二三年六月十八日，结核病夺去了他底年青的生命为止，斯米尔宁斯基是时时刻刻都在战斗着的。共产主义的思想更给了他巨大天才以强有力的翅膀。他底火焰般的诗篇，充满了对劳动人民未来幸福具有毫不动摇信心的共产主义的乐观主义精神。他歌颂了伟大的十月社会主义革命；歌颂了苏联的不可摧毁的力量；歌颂了德国工人阶级的胜利。斯米尔宁斯基成了保加利亚广大的劳动人民所最敬爱的诗人。
    作为一个诗人的斯米尔宁斯基，是走在阶级斗争的最前列的。诗人用笔歌颂他所献身的无产阶级革命事业，鼓舞千万人跟随着党的旗帜前进。同时，革命者的崇高的品质，又给他的诗以丰富的内容。在保加利亚的革命文学中，斯米尔宁斯基是保加利亚无产阶级的、社会主义现实主义的诗歌的创始者。他也是一位具有多方面创作才能的、了不起的天才语言艺术家。从他的诗集“光明是要来的！”里，我们能看到：他创造性地光辉地发展了保加利亚文学奠基人季米特里·波略诺沫的传统。同时，他的诗篇，又像赫里斯托·波切夫歌唱保加利亚人民群众反对土耳其封建压迫的民族解放斗争那样，歌唱着自己时代的革命事件，和全世界工人阶级强大的革命高涨。尽管他去世得早，还是留下了体裁不同的丰富的文学遗产。所有斯米尔宁斯基以后的保加利亚无产阶级诗人，都向他的高度的党性和高度的艺术才能学习。维·契尔文科夫说过：“斯米尔宁斯基和尼·瓦普查罗夫，是赫里斯托·波切夫之后，保加利亚革命诗歌直到现在所达到的最高的顶点。”
    斯米尔宁斯基的马雅可夫斯基式的战斗的革命诗歌，在保加利亚的人民群众中年年月月地传诵着。特别是在那些艰苦的游击战争年代里，没有一个游击队员不晓得斯米尔宁斯基的名字，没有一个游击队员没有念过他的诗。在密林和山地里的营火会上，战士们热情地、动人地朗诵着他那充满着战斗力量的诗篇“煤矿工”、“红色骑兵连”、“所有我们——都是大地母亲的人”等。这些美丽而动人心弦的诗歌，深深地注入成千成万的游击队员心中，鼓舞着他们的战斗。在城市里，人们从公开的或者秘密的刊物上，兴奋地念着斯米尔宁斯基的像匕首一样的讽刺诗。这些诗，赤裸裸地揭露了保加利亚反动统治对劳动人民的残酷压迫和它的叛国政策，也揭发和控诉了帝国主义者的掠夺阴谋。所有这些诗，都在保加利亚劳动人民的心底永远地扎了根，开了花，结了果。
    斯米尔宁斯基在保加利亚人民心中获得如此崇高的地位，不仅是由于他的革命诗篇光辉灿烂的成就，还因为他是一个伟大的战士，是保加利亚劳动人民的忠实的儿子。他底忠于人民、忠于党的高贵品质，同样也成为广大人民学习的榜样。他勇敢地参加党的斗争，忠实地执行党的任务，从不拒绝任何危险的或是艰巨的任务。他保护着工人的示威游行；他在党的俱乐部里持枪守夜；在进行选举斗争的时候，他是一个永远不知道疲倦的鼓动家。斯米尔宁斯基在艺术上能够以那样令人信服的、动人的形象，表现无产阶级革命的壮丽事业，和他自己是一个保加利亚工人运动高涨的目击者和热情的参加者是分不开的。他曾经和维·契尔文科夫同在一个党小组里，这更使他获得了优越的教育。维·契尔文科夫对他的一生，给予了极高的评价，他说：
    “斯米尔宁斯基处在政治斗争的中心，把自己火焰般的笔尖配到刺刀上，战斗的刺刀上，跟奴隶弟兄并肩作战。”
    在保加利亚人民热烈地纪念斯米尔宁斯基逝世三十周年的今天，保加利亚人民已经胜利地建立了人民自己的共和国，并且满怀信心地朝着社会主义的道路迈进。斯米尔宁斯基伟大的革命诗歌，过去曾经火焰般地燃烧在保加利亚人民的心中，今后仍然是鼓舞他们前进的力量；并且随着全世界保卫和平、反对战争的运动的高涨，他的战斗的作品也将加入到人类进步文学的宝库中，而为各国劳动人民所喜爱和传诵。（附图片）
