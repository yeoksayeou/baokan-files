    Can People with Disabilities Attend General Schools?
    Editor's Note: We have continuously received letters from readers reflecting the phenomenon that schools in some areas refuse to admit people with disabilities, or even those with minor physical defects. Readers Xiao Hongzhang, Zhang Wenhai, and others have raised the question of whether people with disabilities or physical defects can attend general schools. The Ministry of Education's brief reply is as follows:
    In New China, everyone has the right to education; people with disabilities or physical defects are no exception. As long as they have the ability to listen, read, write, and speak, they can apply to general schools. If their exam results meet the admission standards, the school should admit them. Only when their physical condition already affects the learning of major subjects or is not suitable for the requirements of the applied subject can they be considered "physically unqualified." If a person with a physical disability attends a general school, and their physical condition is not suitable for physical education, the school may, based on the specific circumstances, approve partial or full exemption. As for those with disabilities who have lost their sight, hearing, or speaking abilities, they are not suitable for attending general schools, but can apply to special schools for the blind or deaf-mute, etc.
    Currently, some schools abuse the reason of "physical unqualified," arbitrarily rejecting applicants without considering whether their physical condition has affected their learning. This is incorrect.

    残废者是否可入一般学校学习
    编者按：我们不断接到读者来信反映，某些地区的学校有拒绝残废者、甚至仅有轻微生理缺陷者入学的现象。读者萧鸿章、张文海等的来信中并且提出了残废者或有生理缺陷者是否可以入一般学校学习的问题，现经教育部简复如下：
    在新中国，人人都有受教育的权利；残废者或有生理缺陷者也不例外。只要他们具有听讲、阅读、书写、说话等能力，都可投考一般学校。如果考试成绩合乎录取标准，学校就应该录取；只有在他们的身体状况已经影响主要学科的学习或不适合所报考学科的要求时，才能被认为“体格不合格”。肢体残废者入一般学校学习，如身体状况不宜上体育科，学校可以根据具体情况准予部分免修或全部免修。至于已经丧失视觉、听觉或说话能力的残废者，不适于入一般学校学习，则可以报考专为他们设立的盲校或聋哑学校等。
    目前部分学校滥用“体格不合格”的理由，不考虑报考者的身体状况是否已致影响学习而任意拒绝其入学，这是不对的。
