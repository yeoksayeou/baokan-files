    Harbin Municipal Consumer Cooperative Re-examines Member Composition
    A letter from the Harbin Municipal Cooperative Federation states: The criticism in the "Brief Economic Commentary" on page two of the People's Daily on March 30 regarding the erroneous admission of capitalists as members by some of our city's cooperatives is correct and profound, and we fully accept it. The consumer cooperatives in various districts of our city have a simplistic task-oriented view in developing membership and expanding shares. In order to increase capital stock, they neglected the examination of member qualifications, thus admitting some capitalists as members. This is indeed a serious error in principle. As the "Brief Economic Commentary" said, they "have not truly understood the nature of the cooperative," nor have they deeply understood that "its business policy should be to serve the masses of members, and should never be for the sole purpose of profit." The reason why such serious errors occurred in grassroots cooperatives is inseparable from the weak ideological leadership and bureaucratic work style of the leading cadres of the Municipal Federation. The Municipal Federation neglected policy education in the development process of the cooperatives, and therefore it was impossible to strictly carry out the business and organizational work of the cooperatives in accordance with the guidelines and policies, so this phenomenon occurred in many district consumer cooperatives and was not corrected for a long time.
    In order to effectively correct the above errors, in addition to instructing the Xifujia District Cooperative to review the composition of its members, we also took into account that this phenomenon is relatively common in the consumer cooperatives of various districts in Harbin (some have been corrected in the past, but not thoroughly). Therefore, in the cooperative work conference convened by the Municipal Party Committee in April, special instructions were given: in the work of establishing and improving democratic management in the second quarter, members should be reviewed to purify the cooperative organization.

### 哈尔滨市消费合作社重新审查社员成分

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    哈尔滨市消费合作社重新审查社员成分
    哈尔滨市合作社联合社来信：人民日报三月三十日二版的“经济生活简评”中对我市某些合作社错误地吸收资本家为社员的批评是正确的、深刻的，我们表示完全接受。我市各区消费合作社在发展社员和扩股工作中存在着单纯任务观点。为了扩大股金，便忽视了对社员条件的审查，因而把一些资本家也吸收为社员。这确是原则性的严重错误。正如“经济生活简评”中所说：“还没有真正懂得合作社的性质”，也没有深刻了解“它的经营方针应该是为社员群众服务，绝不应当以单纯营利为目的。”而基层社之所以产生如此严重的错误，又和市联社的领导干部对下级社的思想领导薄弱和官僚主义的工作作风分不开的。市联社在合作社的发展过程中忽视政策教育，因而也就不可能严格地按照方针政策进行合作社的业务工作和组织工作，所以这一现象在不少地区消费合作社中发生而在较长期内没有被纠正。
    为了切实地改正上述错误，我们除已指示西傅家区合作社对社员成分进行审查外；又鉴于这一现象在哈市各区消费社是比较普遍的（有些过去已纠正过，但还不彻底），所以在四月市委召开的合作工作会议中特别作了指示：在第二季度建立与健全民主管理工作中，应对社员加以审查，以纯洁合作社组织。
