    The Evolution of the Soviet Electoral System
    Wang Shui
    The great October Socialist Revolution created the first country in human history without an exploitative system, and Soviet socialist democracy became the true and highest type of democracy in the world. The Soviet electoral system, from the very beginning, possessed great revolutionary and democratic qualities. As Lenin pointed out: "The socialist nature of Soviet democracy, i.e., proletarian democracy specifically implemented at present, lies in: first, the electorate being the exploited working masses, excluding the bourgeoisie; second, abolishing all bureaucratic formalities and restrictions in elections, with the masses themselves deciding the election procedures and terms, and electors having complete freedom to recall those elected; third, building a vanguard of workers, i.e., the best mass organization of the large industrial proletariat, which enables this vanguard to lead the broadest masses of the exploited, absorb them into independent political life, provide them with political training based on their own experience—and thus, for the first time ever, begin to enable truly all the people to learn to manage the state and begin to manage the state." (The Immediate Tasks of the Soviet Government)
    The democratic nature of the Soviet electoral system has been gradually promoted and improved. From the history of its development, it can be roughly divided into two stages. The first stage was from the victory of the October Revolution to the promulgation of the Stalin Constitution. The most important characteristics of the people's political and economic life in this stage were: suppressing the resistance of the overthrown classes, organizing national defense to prevent interventionist aggression, restoring industry and agriculture, and preparing conditions for the elimination of capitalist elements. Some of the main features of the electoral system at this stage were adapted to these basic conditions and tasks. The first was, as proposed in the "Draft Declaration of Rights of the Exploited and Working People," that "exploiters must not be allowed to participate in any organ of power at the juncture when the people are making the final fight against the exploiters." Therefore, it was stipulated that the exploiting classes and other counter-revolutionary elements should be deprived of the right to vote. In addition, differences in the proportion of representatives elected from urban and rural areas, the indirect election system for Soviet congresses above the county level, and open voting methods were also stipulated. These principles were basically maintained until the promulgation of the Stalin Constitution. After the promulgation of the 1936 Stalin Constitution, it marked the second stage of the development of the Soviet electoral system. At this time, the socio-economic foundation and the balance of class forces in the Soviet Union had undergone fundamental changes: a new socialist industry had been successfully established, collective farms had triumphed, the exploiting classes had been eliminated, and the activities of domestic counter-revolutionary elements had been suppressed. In addition, the boundaries between the working class, peasants, and intellectuals were blurring; the psychology of mutual distrust between nationalities had disappeared, and feelings of mutual love had developed, thus creating a truly fraternal cooperative relationship among all nationalities within a unified alliance of states. These fundamental changes in class and national relations made it possible for the Soviet electoral system to abolish some of the temporary measures adopted during the transition period and to further democratize, that is, to replace restricted elections with universal elections, to replace incompletely equal elections with completely equal elections, to replace indirect elections with direct elections, and to replace open voting elections with secret ballot elections. This change, as stated in the "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)," meant that "many major changes have taken place in Soviet life."
    Now, let us discuss the evolution of the Soviet electoral system in various aspects: From Restricted Elections to Universal Elections
    The election method of the Soviet of Workers', Soldiers', and Peasants' Deputies, established in 1917, was created by the masses themselves in the struggle against the enemy and was formulated based on the Marxist theory of state power developed by Lenin and Stalin. Some of its basic principles became the basis for formulating the electoral system in the early days of the Soviet Union. One of the most important features of the election method was to exclude exploiters, clergy, and White Guards from the elections. The 1918 Constitution of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (hereinafter referred to as the Soviet Russian Constitution) stipulated the deprivation of the right to vote for the following persons: (1) those who use hired labor for the purpose of seeking profits; (2) those who live on non-labor income, such as interest on funds, interest on enterprises, and property income; (3) private merchants, traders, and commercial intermediaries; (4) clergy and religious priests; (5) employees and agents of the old police agencies, gendarmerie special corps, and security offices, as well as the old Russian royal family. This provision was entirely based on the specific conditions of Russia and was naturally formed in the process of revolutionary struggle. These elements had engaged in open war against the people and resisted Soviet laws; therefore, depriving them of the right to vote was the Soviet regime's response to their resistance. This measure eliminated the influence of capitalists and rich peasants on individual backward workers, ensured the consolidation of the Soviet regime, and enabled the task of eliminating exploiters to be successfully realized.
    Regarding the nature of this restriction on voting rights, Lenin repeatedly explained that it was completely unlike that of bourgeois countries, which deprived some citizens of the right to vote for life. It was only a temporary measure and not a "necessary symbol of the logical concept of dictatorship, nor a prerequisite for this historical and class concept."
    During the New Economic Policy period in 1924, various counter-revolutionary elements adopted the tactic of "secret sabotage." Reactionary classes such as rich peasants conspired to use Menshevik and Trotskyite elements within the Communist Party (Bolsheviks) to propose allowing counter-revolutionary representatives to participate in the Soviets, depriving middle peasants of the right to vote, and expelling them from the Soviet grassroots regime. At that time, in addition to exposing and criticizing this rich peasant line by the Communist Party (Bolsheviks), the Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union also issued instructions on election matters in January 1925, emphasizing the implementation of a more decisive class policy and strictly prohibiting those deprived of the right to vote from participating in elections. By 1930, the policy of comprehensive collectivization and the elimination of rich peasants had been gradually implemented, and the initial victory of socialist construction gradually restored the right to vote to the children of rich peasants and some former rich peasants, and prohibited the deprivation of the right to vote to the children of rich peasants who reached adulthood in 1925.
    People's ideology often lags behind objective reality. When the draft of the Stalin Constitution was submitted for nationwide discussion, many people still advocated depriving clergy, former White Guards, and those who did not participate in beneficial social labor of the right to vote. Stalin criticized this opinion and pointed out: "The Soviet regime's deprivation of the right to vote for those who do not work and exploiters was not a permanent measure, but a temporary one, until a certain period. ... In the past period, we have eliminated the exploiting classes, and the Soviet regime has become an invincible force. Has the time not come to review this law? I think it has." (Report on the Draft Constitution of the USSR) At that time, he also explained the reasons for restoring the voting rights of these people: first, these people were not completely hostile to the Soviet regime; second, through the party's propaganda and education, the people would not elect enemies to their highest organs. Based on the above reasons, the Stalin Constitution stipulated the thorough implementation of a completely universal election system, that is, all Soviet citizens who have reached the age of eighteen [Note], regardless of race or nationality, regardless of belief, regardless of education level, regardless of length of residence, regardless of social origin, property status, and past activities, have the right to vote and stand for election (Article 135), women have the same right to vote and stand for election as men (Article 137), and citizens serving in the Soviet army have the same right to vote and stand for election as all citizens (Article 138). These provisions marked the victory of socialism and the increasing consolidation of the Soviets, meaning that the democratic system of Soviet elections was further expanded and improved.
    Because of this, Soviet elections can attract the largest number of voters to participate in the elections. For example, in the election of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union on March 12, 1950, 99.98 percent of voters participated, and the degree of its popularity reached the highest peak in the history of all countries in the world.
    From Incompletely Equal Elections to Completely Equal Elections
    Based on the principles established by the Soviet of Workers', Soldiers', and Peasants' Deputies, differences were stipulated in the proportion of representatives elected between workers and peasants. This unequal proportion was stipulated in the 1918 Soviet Russian Constitution and confirmed by the 1924 Soviet Constitution. Article 25 of the Soviet Russian Constitution stipulated: The All-Russian Congress of Soviets shall be composed of the following quotas: the City Soviet shall send one representative for every 25,000 voters, and the County Soviet Congress shall send one representative for every 125,000 residents. The congresses of Soviets at all levels in the local areas are also stipulated according to this five-to-one principle. In addition to this, the Soviet electoral system in the early days also stipulated that urban areas and workers' districts enjoy dual rights and the method of direct election of upper-level representatives by social organizations. For example, in order to enable urban areas and workers' districts to enjoy direct representation in the high-level Soviets, the Soviet Russian Constitution stipulated that, in addition to electing county representatives, workers' districts could also directly elect representatives to provinces and counties; all cities could directly elect representatives to the All-Russian Congress of Soviets. This made workers' districts and urban areas actually enjoy dual voting rights. In addition, the representatives of various cities in the high-level Soviets were not only elected by the general assembly of the city Soviets, but also partly elected by trade unions and party organizations. In 1920, the highest number of representatives elected by social organizations accounted for 7.6 percent of the total number of representatives to the Provincial Soviet Congress. This system was completely abolished in 1925.
    The above-mentioned differences in the proportion of elections between workers and peasants and some preferential treatment for worker elections were also determined by real life in the process of class struggle. Molotov explained in the article "On the Revision of the Soviet Constitution": "This superior position of the workers was implemented when the peasants were still completely small producers (small private owners) and the influence of rich peasants in the countryside was still very strong. This superior position consolidated the leading role of the working class in the Soviet state, helped consolidate the Soviet regime, and also guaranteed the extensive assistance of the proletarian dictatorship to the working peasants in the development of rural economy and subsequently in the socialist transformation of the countryside. The party pointed out long ago that in order to protect the achievements of the proletarian revolution, this superior position of the workers was necessary at that time, but at the same time it must be emphasized its temporary nature." Regarding the formation of the legal basis for this difference in the proportion of elections between workers and peasants, Lenin once explained and especially emphasized its temporary nature. He pointed out in the report on the party program at the Eighth Party Congress of the Communist Party (Bolsheviks) in 1919: "Methods such as the inequality between workers and peasants are not necessarily stipulated in the constitution at all. The constitution explicitly stipulates them only after these methods have been realized. ... They drafted this constitution according to how it was drafted in actual life. The development of proletarian organizations is much faster than the development of peasant organizations, which makes workers the pillar of the revolution and gives workers an actual superior position. The task in the future is to gradually transition from this superior position to an equal position between workers and peasants."
    Due to a series of political, social, and economic reforms in the Soviet Union, by 1936, the Soviet countryside had undergone some fundamental changes: the rich peasants had been eliminated, the peasants had completely freed themselves from exploitation; the vast majority of peasants had become collective farm peasants, and the economic foundation of the peasants was no longer private ownership, but collective ownership. These changes showed that the boundary between workers and peasants was gradually disappearing. These changes in basic conditions enabled the Soviet elections to adopt completely equal elections without any differences.
    The 1936 Stalin Constitution embodied this principle of complete equality. It stipulated that every citizen has one vote, and all citizens participate in elections on an equal basis. The election regulations for the Supreme Soviet stipulated that representatives participate in elections according to electoral districts, regardless of cities and villages, and each 300,000 people are divided into electoral districts. All electoral districts can only elect one representative to the Union Soviet, which means that all electoral districts and all voters in electoral districts are completely equal to each other. Secondly, the equality reflected in the election of the Soviet of Nationalities is: each member republic elects 25 representatives, each autonomous republic elects 11 representatives, each autonomous region elects 5 representatives, and each national district elects 1 representative, jointly forming the Soviet of Nationalities. This electoral system "fully conforms to the great principles of the Leninist-Stalinist national policy, that is, to guarantee the strong economic, political, and cultural growth of the many nationalities of the Soviet Union united in a unified, fraternal, and multi-ethnic socialist worker-peasant state." (Vyshinsky: Answers to Questions on the 1937 Election Regulations of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union)
    From Indirect Elections to Direct Elections
    Indirect election means that the representatives of the high-level state power organs are not directly elected by the voters, but are elected by the "electors" elected by the voters. The higher the level, the more levels it passes through, so we sometimes call it a multi-level election.
    According to the 1918 Soviet Russian Constitution, the electoral system at that time had two methods: direct election and indirect election. Representatives of the city and village Soviets, which are the basic-level political power units, are directly elected by the voters (single level); representatives of the County Soviet Congress are elected by the general assembly of the township and county-administered city Soviets (two levels); representatives of the Provincial or County Soviet Congress are elected by the general assembly of the County Soviet and the representatives of the City Soviet (three levels); representatives of the Soviet Congress of the Union Republic are elected by the Provincial, County, and City Soviet Congress (four levels). The Soviet Constitution formulated in 1924 stipulated that the representatives of the Soviet Congress of the Soviet Union were also indirectly elected, that is, elected by the County (Provincial) and Republic Soviet Congresses that do not have counties.
    This multi-level election system was also stipulated by the domestic political and economic situation in the Soviet Union at that time. In the early days of the founding of the Soviet Union, it encountered civil war, imperialist intervention, and the sabotage of domestic counter-revolutionary elements; there were still some uncoordinated relations between urban and rural areas and between workers and peasants; and the masses still had some degree of doubt about the Soviet regime. Therefore, only two methods, direct election and indirect election, could be implemented in parallel. Lenin explained this method: "The adoption of indirect elections for non-local Soviets makes it easier to hold the Soviet Congress, makes all agencies cheaper and more flexible, and makes them closer to workers and peasants in times of intense life and need to quickly recall their local representatives or send them to participate in the National Soviet Congress." (The Proletarian Revolution and the Renegade Kautsky) Although this election method had some shortcomings, it "was necessary in the past and has completely proven to be correct." Therefore, "in the years of civil war and even in many years after that, our economic, cultural, and socio-political conditions made it difficult for us to transition from multi-level elections to direct elections" (Vyshinsky: Answers to Questions on the 1937 Election Regulations of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union). Even so, due to the class and democratic nature of the Soviet regime, representatives cannot work smoothly if they do not maintain close contact with the voters in their work area. Therefore, although there are obstacles in the connection between voters and representatives in form, this does not decisively affect the democratic and revolutionary nature of the regime.
    The 1936 Stalin Constitution stipulated that "all Soviets of Workers' Representatives, from the Village and City Soviets of Workers' Representatives to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, shall be directly elected by citizens." (Article 139) The multi-level election system that had been in effect for nearly 20 years was declared to be over, and the democratic election system was further improved. The implementation of the direct election system further enhanced the prestige of the Soviet power organs at all levels and strengthened the connection between these organs and the broad masses of working people, thereby advancing the entire work of the Soviet leadership organs.
    From Open Voting Elections to Secret Ballot Elections
    The 1918 Soviet Russian Constitution and the 1924 Soviet Constitution did not specify the voting method, but in fact they were all conducted by open voting. In the 1925 "Instructions of the All-Russian Central Executive Committee on the Election Procedures of the City and Village Soviets and the Convening Procedures of the Soviet Congress," it was clearly stipulated that "elections shall be held by open voting method." As for the so-called open voting method, as Vyshinsky said in "Answers to Election Questions," in fact, many of them adopted the "simple method of raising hands." The reason for adopting this method, in addition to the political and social conditions at that time, was also that the cultural level of most voters was low. According to the Russian literacy statistics table quoted by Lenin in "Excerpts from Diaries," in 1920, there were only 319 literate people per 1,000 Russians.
    After the implementation of the compulsory education system and adult literacy programs in 1930, the number of illiterate people had been greatly reduced by the time the Stalin Constitution was promulgated. Therefore, the Stalin Constitution stipulated that "the election of representatives shall be conducted by secret ballot." (Article 140) In addition, the election regulations specifically stipulated measures to ensure the implementation of secret ballots.
    Changing to the secret ballot method can ensure that voters can express their will more freely and independently, ensure that voters are not bound by "face," and do not face mental threats for not voting for someone. At the same time, the secret ballot method is also one of the important means of criticism and self-criticism. It can supervise the representatives from below and urge the representatives to pay more attention to public opinion and treat their work more sincerely. The change to the secret ballot method marked a further development of socialist democracy.
    From the evolution of the Soviet electoral system and from the instructions of Lenin and Stalin on elections, we can understand that the electoral system is a reflection of the country's real life. It should adapt to the development of social politics and adapt to the requirements of the revolutionary situation. The electoral system is created by the masses of the people in the revolutionary struggle and is subject to class struggle. The provisions of the electoral system should focus on actual democracy, and not necessarily on form. When various conditions are not yet available, the electoral system must have some temporary and adapted restrictive provisions; and when various conditions are available, the electoral system can be gradually perfected and thoroughly implement the principles of "universal, equal, direct, and secret" elections.
    [Note] In December 1945, the two houses of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union passed the proposal of the Legislative Committee, and the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet issued an order on the election of the Supreme Soviet, stipulating that the age qualification for being elected as a representative of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union was raised from 18 to 23, and the representatives of the Supreme Soviets of the member republics and the autonomous republics were raised to 21. This order was approved by the First Congress of the Second Session of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union in 1946, and the constitution was revised.

    苏联选举制度的演变
    王水
    伟大的十月社会主义革命，创造了人类历史上第一个没有剥削制度的国家，苏维埃社会主义的民主，成为世界上真正的、最高类型的民主。苏联的选举制度，从一开始就具有极大的革命性与民主性。这正如列宁所指出的：“苏维埃民主制，即目前具体实施的无产阶级民主制的社会主义性质就在于：第一，选举人为被剥削的劳动群众，而资产阶级则不在其列；第二，废除了选举上一切官僚主义的形式手续和限制，群众自己决定选举手续和期限，选举人有召回被选举人的完全自由；第三，建成劳动者先锋队，即大工业无产阶级的最优良的群众组织，此种组织，使这先锋队能够领导最广大的被剥削群众，吸收他们参加独立的政治生活，根据他们自身的经验给他们以政治训练，——因而是空前第一次着手来使真正全体人民都学习管理国家，并开始管理国家。”（苏维埃政权的当前任务）
    苏联选举制度的民主性质，是逐渐发扬、逐步完备起来的。从它发展的历史看，大体可分作两个阶段。由十月革命胜利到斯大林宪法颁布以前，是第一个阶段。这一阶段的人民政治生活和经济生活的最主要特征是：镇压已被推翻的阶级的反抗，组织国防以防干涉者侵袭，恢复工业和农业，准备消灭资本主义因素的条件。这一阶段选举制度的若干主要特点，是和这些基本情况、基本任务相适应的。首先是像“被剥削劳动人民权利宣言草案”所提出的“当人民与剥削者作最后斗争的关头，在任何一个政权机关中都决不能有剥削者插足的余地”，因此规定褫夺剥削阶级及其他反革命分子的选举权。此外，还规定了城乡选举代表比例的差别，县以上苏维埃代表大会的间接选举制，以及公开投票方法等。这些原则，基本上维持到斯大林宪法颁布的时候。一九三六年斯大林宪法颁布以后，是苏联选举制度发展的第二个阶段。在这时苏联的社会经济基础和阶级力量对比关系业已发生了基本变化：新的社会主义工业已建立成功，集体农庄已经胜利，剥削阶级已被消灭，国内反革命分子活动已被镇压下去。此外，工人阶级、农民、知识界间的界线在泯灭着；各民族间互不信任的心理已消失，而互相友爱的情感已经发展，并因此造成了各族人民在一个统一联盟国家体系中真正兄弟合作的关系。以上这些阶级关系、民族关系的基本变化，已使得苏联的选举制度有可能废止在过渡时期所采用的若干临时办法，进一步民主化，即以普遍的选举代替有限制的选举，以完全平等的选举代替不完全平等的选举，以直接的选举代替多级的选举，以秘密投票的选举代替公开投票的选举。这种变化，正如“联共（布）党史”所说的，苏联“生活中已发生了许多重大的变更”。
    现在把苏联选举制度在各方面的演变，分述于下：由有限制的选举到普遍的选举
    一九一七年定出的工农兵代表苏维埃的选举办法，是在与敌人斗争中由群众自己所创造的，是根据列宁、斯大林所发展了的马克思主义的国家政权学说所制定的。它的若干基本原则，成为苏联建国初期制订选举制度的基础。选举办法中最主要特点之一，便是将剥削者、僧侣及白卫分子摈除于选举之外。一九一八年俄罗斯苏维埃联邦社会主义共和国宪法（以下简称苏俄宪法）规定了剥夺以下各种人的选举权：（一）以谋取利润为目的而使用雇佣劳动的人；（二）依靠非劳动之收入如资金生息、企业生息、财产收入等为生的人；（三）私商、贸易及商业中间人；（四）僧侣及宗教祭司；（五）旧警察机构、宪兵特别团及保安所的职员与代理人，以及旧俄皇族。这种规定，完全是根据俄国的具体条件，是革命斗争进程中所自然形成的。这些分子进行过反对人民的公开战争，反抗过苏维埃法律；因此，褫夺他们的选举权，就是苏维埃政权对他们这种反抗行动的回答。由于这种措施，消除了资本家与富农对个别落后劳动者的影响，保证了苏维埃政权的巩固，使消灭剥削者的任务得以顺利实现。
    关于这种限制选举权的性质，列宁曾一再解释它完全不像资产阶级国家那样，剥夺某些公民终身的选举权，它只是暂时性措施，而不是“专政这一逻辑概念的必要标志，它不是这一历史概念与阶级概念的必备条件”。
    一九二四年新经济政策时期，各种反革命分子采用了“秘密破坏”战术，富农等反动阶级阴谋利用在联共（布）党内的孟什维克及托派分子，提议容许反革命代表参加苏维埃，剥夺中农选举权并将他们驱逐出苏维埃基层政权。当时除由联共（布）党暴露并批判了这种富农路线外，苏联中央执行委员会并于一九二五年一月发布关于选举事宜的指示，强调推行更决定性的阶级政策，严格禁止被剥夺选举者参加选举。到一九三○年全面集体化及消灭富农政策已逐步实施，社会主义建设初步胜利，才渐渐恢复富农子弟及过去某些富农的选举权，并禁止剥夺一九二五年成年的富农子弟选举权。
    人们的思想意识常常是落后于客观实际的。在斯大林宪法草案交付全民讨论时，仍有不少人主张褫夺僧侣、从前白卫分子和不参加有益社会劳动的人们的选举权。斯大林批判了这个意见，并指出：“苏维埃政权从前褫夺那些不劳动分子和剥削分子的选举权，并不是一种永久的办法，而是暂时的，到一定时期为止的办法。……在过去这一时期中，我们已经把剥削阶级消灭了，而苏维埃政权则已变成为不可战胜的力量了。难道还没有到审改这种法律的时候么？我认为是已经到了。”（论苏联宪法草案的报告）当时，他还说明了恢复这些人的选举权的理由：第一、这些人并非完全是敌视苏维埃政权的；第二、经过党的宣传教育，人民不会把敌人选到自己的最高机关中去。基于上述理由，斯大林宪法规定彻底实行完全的普遍选举制，即凡年满十八岁的苏联公民〔注〕，不分种族及民族，不分信仰，不分教育程度，不问居住期限，不问社会出身、财产状况以及过去活动如何，皆有选举权及被选举权（一三五条），妇女有与男子同等之选举权及被选举权（一三七条），在苏联军队中服务之公民，有与一切公民同等之选举权及被选举权（一三八条）。这些规定，标志着社会主义胜利与苏维埃的日益巩固，意味着苏联选举的民主制度更加扩张，更加完备。
    正因为如此，所以苏联的选举才能吸引最大多数的选民参加选举。例如一九五○年三月十二日苏联最高苏维埃的选举，选民有百分之九九点九八参加，其普及的程度，达到世界各国历史上的最高峰。
    由不完全平等的选举到完全平等的选举
    根据工农兵代表苏维埃所建立的原则，曾规定工人与农民间在代表选举比例上的差别。这个不平等的比例并曾规定在一九一八年苏俄宪法上，又经一九二四年苏联宪法加以确认。苏俄宪法第二十五条规定：全俄苏维埃代表大会按下列名额组成之，市苏维埃按每选民二万五千人选派代表一人，郡苏维埃代表大会按每居民十二万五千人选派代表一人。地方各级苏维埃代表大会，亦均按此五比一的原则规定之。除此之外，苏联初期选举制度，还规定了市区、工人区享有两重权益和经由社会组织直接选举上级代表办法。例如，为使市区及工人区在高级苏维埃中享有直接代表权，苏俄宪法便规定，工人区除选县代表外，同时对省、郡亦得直接选举代表；各市则均可直接选举全俄苏维埃代表大会代表。这样就使工人区及市区实际上享有两重选举权。此外，当时各市在高级苏维埃的代表，不仅由各市苏维埃全体大会选举，还有一部分是经由工会和党组织所选出。一九二○年这种由社会组织所选出的代表人数，其最高额有的占省苏维埃代表大会代表总数的百分之七点六，这种制度，到一九二五年才完全废止。
    关于以上这种工农间选举比例的差别及对于工人选举的若干优待，也是在阶级斗争过程中，由现实生活本身所决定的。莫洛托夫在“关于苏联宪法的修正”一文中曾说明：“工人方面的这种优越地位，是当着农民还完全是小生产者（小私有者）并且富农在乡村中的势力还是很大的时候，被实行了的。这种优越地位巩固了工人阶级在苏维埃国家中的领导作用，帮助了苏维埃政权的巩固，同时也保证了无产阶级专政在发展农村经济上以及随后在农村的社会主义改造上，对于劳动农民的广泛援助。党早就指出，为了保障无产阶级革命成果，工人方面的这种优越地位在当时是必要的，但同时又必须强调它的临时性质。”关于这种工农选举比例差别法律基础的形成，列宁曾有过解释，并特别强调了它的临时性。他在一九一九年联共第八次党代表大会上关于党纲的报告中即指出：“像工人与农民不平等这类的办法，就根本不是宪法上所必须载定的。宪法是在这些办法业已实现以后，才把它们明文规定下来。……他们是按照实际生活所拟订的那样来拟订了这宪法。无产阶级组织的发展比农民组织的发展快得多，这就使工人成了革命的支柱，而给了工人实际上的优越地位。往后的任务就是要从这种优越地位逐渐过渡到工农间的平等地位。”
    由于苏联在国内经过一系列政治的、社会的、经济的改革，到一九三六年时苏联农村已经产生了一些根本的变化：富农已被消灭，农民已完全摆脱剥削；绝大多数农民已成为集体农庄的农民，农民经济基础已不是私人所有制，而是集体所有制。这些变化表明：工人与农民之间的界线是在日渐泯灭。这些基本条件的变化，便使苏维埃选举有可能采用无任何差别的、完全平等的选举。
    一九三六年斯大林宪法中体现了这种完全平等的原则。它规定每一公民均有一票选举权，一切公民都在平等基础上参加选举。在最高苏维埃选举条例中，规定代表均按选区参加选举，不分城市和乡村，每三十万人划一选区，所有选区都只能选一名代表到联盟苏维埃，也就是各个选区间、各个选区的选民间，彼此都完全平等。其次，表现在民族苏维埃选举上的平等则为：每一盟员共和国选代表二十五名，每一自治共和国选代表十一名，每一自治省选代表五名，每一民族州选代表一名，共同组成民族苏维埃。这种选举制度，“完全符合列宁斯大林民族政策的伟大原则，即保证着团结在统一的兄弟般的多民族的、社会主义的工农国家里的苏联许多民族强大经济的、政治的与文化的增长。”（维辛斯基：关于一九三七年苏联最高苏维埃选举条例的问题解答）
    由间接选举到直接选举
    间接选举，意思是指高级政权机关代表会议的代表，不是由选民直接选出，而是经由选民所选出的“选举人”所选举的。这种选举办法，愈到高级则经过的层级也愈多，因此，我们有时就称之为多级选举。
    按照一九一八年苏俄宪法的规定，当时的选举制度有直接选举和间接选举两种方式：基层政权单位的市和乡村苏维埃代表，由选民直接选举（单级）；县苏维埃代表大会代表，由乡及县辖市苏维埃全体大会选举（两级）；省或郡苏维埃代表大会代表，由县苏维埃全体大会及市苏维埃代表选举（三级）；联盟共和国苏维埃代表大会代表，则由省、郡及市苏维埃大会选举（四级）。一九二四年制订的苏联宪法，规定苏联苏维埃代表大会代表，也是间接选举，即由郡（省）及不设郡的共和国苏维埃代表大会选出。
    这种多级选举的制度，也是由当时苏联国内的政治、经济情况规定的。苏联建国初期曾遭遇到内战、帝国主义干涉和国内反革命分子的破坏；城乡、工农关系还有某些不协调；群众对苏维埃政权还怀着某种程度的疑虑。因此，便只能是直接选举和间接选举两种办法并行。列宁关于这种办法曾解释说：“对于非地方性的苏维埃采用非直接的选举制，就使苏维埃代表大会易于举行，使全部机关更加便宜和更加灵活，使其在生活紧张与需要能急速召回自己地方代表或派遣他们去参加全国苏维埃代表大会的时期，更加接近工农。”（无产阶级革命与叛徒考茨基）这种选举办法，尽管有某些缺点，但是，它“在过去却曾是必要的，而且也完全证明是正确的”，因此，“在内战的年代里，甚至在以后的许多年内，我们经济、文化及社会政治的状况，都使我们难以由多级选举过渡到直接选举”（维辛斯基：关于一九三七年苏联最高苏维埃选举条例的问题解答）。虽然如此，由于苏维埃政权阶级的、民主的性质，代表若不和他工作区域内选民取得密切联系，便无法顺利地进行工作，因而尽管在形式上存在着选民与代表在联系上的障碍，但这并不能决定地影响其政权的民主性与革命性。
    一九三六年斯大林宪法颁布，规定“凡一切劳动者代表苏维埃，自乡村及城市劳动者代表苏维埃起，至苏联最高苏维埃止，皆迳由公民直接选举之。”（一三九条）施行近二十年的多级选举制便宣告终结，民主选举制度更加完备了。直接选举制的实行，更加提高了苏维埃各级政权机关的威信，加强了这些机关同广大劳动人民的联系，从而使得苏维埃领导机关的全部工作向前推进一步。
    由公开投票选举到秘密投票选举
    在一九一八年的苏俄宪法及一九二四年的苏联宪法上，对于投票方法并未加以规定，但事实上都是以公开投票法进行的。在一九二五年“全俄中央执行委员会关于市、村苏维埃选举程序及苏维埃代表大会召开程序的指示”中，开始明文规定“选举依公开的投票方法来举行”。所谓公开投票方法，照维辛斯基在“选举问题解答”中所说的，实际上很多是采用了“简单的举手方法”。采用这种方法的原因，除了当时的政治社会条件之外，还在于大部分选民的文化程度低。根据列宁在“日记摘录”中所引证的俄国识字人数统计表说明，在一九二○年时，每一千个俄国人中，识字人数只有三一九人。
    一九三○年推行强迫教育制和成人补习办法以后，到斯大林宪法颁布时，文盲数字已大为减少。因此，斯大林宪法规定“代表之选举用秘密投票法行之。”（一四○条）此外在选举条例中，并具体规定了保障施行秘密投票的办法。
    改用秘密投票法，就可以保证选民能够更自由地独立地表示他们的意志，保证投票人不受“情面”拘束，不致因不投某人的票而受到精神威胁。同时，秘密投票法，也是批评和自我批评重要手段之一。它可以从下面实行对代表的监督，促使代表更多地注视社会舆论，更诚恳地对待自己的工作。改用秘密投票方法，标志了社会主义民主的进一步发展。
    从苏联选举制度的演变中，从列宁、斯大林关于选举的指示中，我们可以体会到：选举制度是国家的现实生活的反映，它应该适应于社会政治的发展情况，适应于革命形势的要求。选举制度是人民群众在革命斗争中创造的，是服从于阶级斗争的。选举制度的规定，应该着眼于实际的民主，而不一定计求于形式。当各种条件还不具备时，选举制度便必须有某些临时性的与此适应的限制的规定；而到各种条件具备后，选举制度就可以逐渐完备化，彻底实行“普遍、平等、直接、不记名”的原则。
    〔注〕一九四五年十二月，苏联最高苏维埃两院通过法制委员会的提议，并由最高苏维埃主席团发布关于最高苏维埃选举的命令，规定苏联最高苏维埃代表被选年龄资格，从十八岁提高到二十三岁，各盟员共和国及各自治共和国最高苏维埃代表则提高到二十一岁。此项命令复经一九四六年苏联最高苏维埃第二届第一次大会批准，并将宪法加以修改。
