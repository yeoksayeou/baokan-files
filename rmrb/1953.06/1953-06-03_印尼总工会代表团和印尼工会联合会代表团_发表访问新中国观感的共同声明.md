(Xinhua News Agency) The delegation of the Indonesian Central Trade Union and the delegation of the Indonesian Trade Union Federation read out a joint statement signed by all members of the two trade union delegations on their impressions of visiting New China at a reception held by the Zhejiang Provincial and Hangzhou Municipal Federation of Trade Unions on the evening of May 28. The full text of the statement is as follows:

The Indonesian Central Trade Union and the Indonesian Trade Union Federation are the two largest trade union organizations in Indonesia. At the invitation of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, they participated in the "May Day" International Labor Day celebrations held in Beijing in 1953 and attended the Seventh National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions. Subsequently, they visited various parts of New China (from Shenyang in the north to Guangdong in the south).

The Indonesian trade union delegation, representing the Indonesian Central Trade Union and the Indonesian Trade Union Federation, has personally witnessed the social changes in Asia's largest country, namely the change from an agricultural country to an industrial country. This change is now being intensified by the first great five-year economic and industrial construction plan.

The Indonesian trade union delegation, along with trade union representatives from Asia, Europe, Africa, and Australia, had the opportunity to visit factories, cities, and rural areas, and personally witnessed the living conditions of all classes of people in China after they were freed from the corrupt Kuomintang government supported by imperialism. In particular, they saw the heroic spirit of patriotism displayed by the working class of New China in their creative labor emulation for the construction of their own country. Because the government of the People's Republic of China is very concerned about the material and spiritual life of the workers, the living standards of workers in New China are improving day by day, and more and more newly built workers' residences, sanatoriums, hospitals, nurseries, and spare-time schools are being built. Labor insurance, pensions, social welfare and other undertakings have received full attention from trade unions and the government.

Through this visit, the Indonesian trade union delegation is also deeply convinced of the important role of workers in building the motherland. Only when workers realize that their blood and sweat are for their own motherland, and not for the exclusive possession of capitalists, can they have an enthusiastic and energetic working spirit.

In the struggle for complete national independence, the working class occupies a major position. Taking the struggle experience of Shanghai workers as an example, the Indonesian trade union delegation realized how acute the struggle of Shanghai workers was against the oppression of Japanese fascism and the Kuomintang. The inhumane massacre of worker leaders by Japanese fascists and the Kuomintang did not intimidate the patriotic Shanghai workers. They continued to fight for their rights until the People's Liberation Army entered Shanghai.

Now, the basic task of Chinese trade unions is to mobilize all forces to increase production in order to realize the first five-year plan.

Seeing the ability and facts shown by Chinese workers in building the Guanting Reservoir and manufacturing various kinds of machines, the Indonesian trade union delegation believes that Chinese workers will surely complete their tasks and achieve brilliant achievements.

The increasing prosperity of New China and the increasing improvement of workers' lives are of great contribution to world peace and international trade. For Indonesia, this will give great encouragement to the Indonesian people, who have always been constrained by the Round Table Conference Agreement and are now striving for complete independence.

The Indonesian trade union delegation hopes that the Indonesian working class can also obtain the same life as Chinese workers, and be able to immediately contribute their strength to the construction of the motherland in line with national interests.

There are many things that New China's workers are worth learning from by the Indonesian workers. The pre-liberation struggle experience and the current construction experience are all worth learning from by the Indonesian workers. The Indonesian trade union delegation, representing the Indonesian Central Trade Union and the Indonesian Trade Union Federation, calls on members of the Indonesian Central Trade Union and the Indonesian Trade Union Federation, other trade union members, and Indonesian workers who have not participated in trade union organizations to more actively organize a united front of workers. With the united strength of the workers, the Indonesian workers will surely be able to follow the path of China, that is, to get rid of the shackles of imperialism and thus build their own motherland.

We express our gratitude to the Chinese Trade Union for the opportunity given to us, and hope that the friendship between the working classes of China and Indonesia will be further consolidated.

    印尼总工会代表团和印尼工会联合会代表团
    发表访问新中国观感的共同声明
    【新华社讯】印尼总工会代表团和印尼工会联合会代表团于五月二十八日晚在浙江省和杭州市总工会联合会举行的招待会上，宣读了由两工会代表团全体签名的访问新中国观感的共同声明，声明全文如下：
    印尼总工会与印尼工会联合会是印尼两个最大的工会组织，它们应中华全国总工会的邀请，参加了在北京举行的一九五三年“五一”国际劳动节庆祝典礼，并出席了中国工会第七次全国代表大会，随后即到新中国各地（从北方的沈阳到南方的广东）参观游览。
    代表印尼总工会与印尼工会联合会的印尼工会代表团，已亲眼看到亚洲最大国家的社会变化，即从农业国走向工业国的变化。这一变化现在正由于第一个伟大的五年经济与工业建设计划正在加紧地进行着。
    印尼工会代表团同亚洲、欧洲、非洲、澳洲等工会代表，已获得机会参观工厂、城市和农村，而且亲眼看到中国各阶层人民在摆脱了为帝国主义所支持的腐败的国民党政府以后生活状况，特别是看到了新中国工人阶级在为了自己国家的建设而进行创造性的劳动竞赛中，所表现的爱国主义的英雄精神。由于中华人民共和国政府很关怀工人的物质与精神生活，新中国工人的生活正在日益提高，新建筑起来的工人住宅、疗养院、医院、托儿所和业余学校越来越多。劳动保险、养老金、社会福利等事业，得到了工会和政府的充分关怀。
    通过这次参观，印尼工会代表团也深信工人在建设祖国中的重要地位。只要工人认识他们所流的血汗是为了自己的祖国，而不是为了独占资本家的时候，他们才有热情充沛的劳动精神。
    在争取完全的民族独立的斗争中，工人阶级占着主要的地位。以上海工人的斗争经验为例，印尼工会代表团认识到上海工人在反对日本法西斯主义的压迫与国民党的压迫的斗争是何等的尖锐。日本法西斯与国民党对工人领袖的惨无人道的屠杀，并没有吓倒具有爱国主义精神的上海工人，他们为争取自己的权利而继续斗争，直到人民解放军进入上海。
    现在中国工会的基本任务，就是动员一切力量来提高生产，以便实现第一个五年计划。
    看到了中国工人在建筑官厅水库和制造各种各样的机器当中所表现的能力和事实，印尼工会代表团认为中国工人必能完成其任务并获得辉煌的成就。
    新中国的日益繁荣，工人生活的日益提高，对世界和平及国际贸易是有重大的贡献的。对印尼来说，这将给予一向受着圆桌会议协定的约束而现在正在为争取完全的独立的印尼人民以巨大的鼓舞。
    印尼工会代表团希望印尼工人阶级也能获得像中国工人一样的生活，能够即刻为符合民族利益的祖国建设而贡献自己的力量。
    新中国工人有许多东西是值得印尼学习的，解放前的斗争经验和现在的建设经验，都是值得印尼工人学习的。代表印尼总工会和印尼工会联合会的印尼工会代表团，呼吁印尼总工会和印尼工会联合会的会员，其他工会会员以及没有参加工会组织的印尼工人更积极地组织工人统一战线。以工人团结一致的力量，印尼工人必能走向中国的道路，即摆脱帝国主义的束缚从而建设自己的祖国。
    我们对中国工会所给予我们的机会表示感谢，并希望中国和印尼两国工人阶级的友谊进一步巩固起来。
