    A Lesson Worth Learning
    By our reporter Wang Qi
    The No. 19 drilling rig was selected as a model drilling rig last October. However, during the safety inspection in February of this year, the factory frame of the No. 19 drilling rig was unsafe, the tripod was not straight, and everything was not up to standard. As a result, the production progress declined, and the task for the first quarter was not completed. The rig leader Yang Chunmao was not at ease with his work and requested a job transfer. Everyone said: The No. 19 model drilling rig has become a "troublesome" drilling rig.

    An Unhealthy Start
    The drilling work of Team 429 only started comprehensively in July last year. In October, the leading cadres proposed to select model drilling rigs, model teams, and model individuals. The conditions for selecting models were very comprehensive, and the selection time was half a month. The steps for selecting models were: first, the drilling rig personnel discussed, then the team discussed, and then the model selection committee of the team headquarters discussed; the entire work was controlled by the model selection committee. At the beginning, when the model selection committee discussed whether the No. 19 drilling rig and another drilling rig were models, a fierce debate occurred. Some people believed that the No. 19 drilling rig had not completed its task for a month and should not be rated as a model drilling rig; and some people believed that the other drilling rig had an accident and should not be rated as a model drilling rig. The two sides held their own opinions, and the leading cadres were not sure and could not make a correct conclusion for a long time. In the end, they had to rate both drilling rigs as model drilling rigs. This kind of chaotic thinking was also common among the masses. Take the No. 19 drilling rig as an example: In order to select a model team, the rig leader Yang Chunmao summoned the team leaders in advance to deliberate on selecting Yang Changfu's team as a model, but everyone rejected it in the formal meeting. From then on, the three shifts were not united and each did their own thing. When people were transferred out of Yang Changfu's team, no other team was willing to transfer people in. Some people who were not rated as models had negative thoughts and wanted to quit. The model selection committee did not understand this situation at all. Leading cadres had also sent people to the No. 19 drilling rig to investigate in order to understand the situation in depth. But the materials obtained were all good, without any shortcomings. One of the model deeds said that the No. 19 drilling rig had fully promoted the advanced experience of the one-time sand filling method, but Wang Rongsheng, the leader of one of the three shifts, said: "I used to fill sand like this, and I still fill sand like this now. I have never heard of any one-time sand filling method."
    The No. 19 model drilling rig thus flashed in the pan, and unhealthy seeds were sown at the moment of its birth.

    Is Meeting Important or Production Important?
    Holding meetings and production are not inherently opposed; holding meetings is directly and indirectly for the purpose of improving production. However, this issue became a major problem in the mind of Yang Chunmao, the leader of the No. 19 drilling rig. At the beginning of this year, Team 429 held a team-wide cadre rectification summary work conference, which lasted for more than twenty days. Leading cadres at the time emphasized the importance of this conference. Yang Chunmao, the leader of the No. 19 drilling rig, was also one of the participants. In the middle of the meeting, Yang Chunmao asked to go to the drilling rig to take a look, but the deputy captain did not approve it. When the leading cadres discovered during the safety inspection in February that the installation of the No. 19 drilling rig was very substandard and had to be reworked, they convened many meetings to criticize Yang Chunmao for being irresponsible. Yang Chunmao went to Huangshi City for a week-long meeting in December last year, and then conveyed it for several days, totaling more than ten days. When Yang Chunmao returned from Huangshi City, he saw that the production situation of the drilling rig was not good, and he had also reported it to the deputy captain, but it was not resolved. Yang Chunmao felt a little discouraged, thinking, "It doesn't matter whether I do this rig leader or not." Yang Chunmao held several positions: rig leader, trade union youth committee member, youth league branch secretary, technical research group leader, and safety inspection committee member. He usually had to attend a meeting every day, plus the twenty-odd days of the summary work meeting, which inevitably affected the time he spent mastering production. Leading cadres did not discover and solve these problems in time, but only convened meetings to criticize Yang Chunmao after the accident occurred, and insisted that Yang Chunmao be responsible: "You are the rig leader, you must be responsible!" Yang Chunmao said: "I am the rig leader, I should be responsible, but how can I be responsible if I am not on the drilling rig?" Leading cadres believed: "You must be responsible even if you are not there!" Yang Chunmao went home and cried several times in anger. In the end, he still made a public self-criticism. However, his thinking did not completely solve the problem. Even now, when he talks about this matter, he still says: "I can't tell whether holding meetings is more important or production is more important? The things that the leaders publicly announced have been overturned." From then on, he developed a kind of negative distrust of the leadership, and his work became even more uneasy. Speaking of this matter, some leading cadres also couldn't figure it out. They emphasized that they had provided a lot of help to the work of the No. 19 drilling rig. What help was that? In order to take care of Yang Chunmao's many affairs, a honest person, Ji Anpu, was specially transferred to be the deputy rig leader; the "difficult to lead people" were removed by various means; in order to maintain the model title of the No. 19 drilling rig, Yang Chunmao was not asked to drill deep wells; in order to take care of Yang Chunmao's emotions, he was allowed to go to Huangshi City for a meeting, and he was welcomed when he returned; and during the safety inspection, how many meetings were held to ask Yang Chunmao to admit his mistakes, and so on. These tasks, one after another, were indeed numerous, but they just happened to miss the most central problem of the No. 19 drilling rig, that is, the disunity and slack in production that arose from the initial selection of models, resulting in the current situation.

    A Lesson Worth Learning
    What is the situation of the No. 19 drilling rig now? All the workers still want to maintain the title of model drilling rig, but the burden of "model becoming trouble" is suffocating them. Leading cadres are at a loss as to what to do with the No. 19 drilling rig, letting it develop on its own. When they talk about it, they only feel "headache" and have not fully realized the significance of this failed lesson. Work is very busy, and appeals and arrangements are coming one after another. In March, the work of the second model selection was arranged again. This is a matter that deserves attention, especially in the second model selection, if leading cadres and the masses (especially leading cadres) do not clearly recognize the harm of treating models with a bureaucratic attitude, it will be very difficult to avoid repeating the situation that occurred in the No. 19 drilling rig.

### 一个值得吸取的教训

    一个值得吸取的教训
    本报记者  汪琦
    十九号钻机去年十月被选为模范钻机。但在今年二月安全大检查时，十九号钻机厂房架子不安全，三角架不正，一切都不合规格，因此生产进度下降，第一季没有完成任务。机长杨春茂工作不安心，要求调工作。大家都说：十九号模范钻机变成“麻烦”钻机了。
    不健康的开始
    四二九队的钻探工作，去年七月份才全面展开。十月份，领导干部提出要评选模范钻机、模范班和模范人。评选模范的条件非常全面，评选模范的时间是半个月。评选模范的步骤是：先由钻机人员讨论，分队讨论，而后由队部评选模范委员会讨论；整个工作由评选模范委员会掌握。开始，评选模范委员会讨论十九号钻机和另一个钻机是不是模范时，曾发生了一场激烈的争论。有些人认为十九号钻机有一个月没有完成任务，不应当评为模范钻机；又有一些人认为另一个钻机出了一次事故，不应评为模范钻机。两方面各执一词，领导干部心里没有底，很久不能做出正确的结论。最后，只好把两个钻机都评为模范钻机。这种混乱思想，在群众中也普遍存在。就拿十九号钻机来说吧：为了选模范班，机长杨春茂事先召集班长酝酿要选杨长富班为模范，但在正式开会时，大家却否定了。从此以后，三班不团结，各干各的。杨长富班调人出去了，要从别班调人去，那一班也不肯。有些没有被评为模范的人有消极思想，想不干了。评选模范委员会对这种情况一点不了解。领导干部为了深入了解情况，也曾派人到十九号钻机调查过。但所得到的材料都是好的，没有一点缺点。模范事迹中有一条说，十九号钻机全部推广了一次投砂法的先进经验，而三班中有一个班的班长王荣生却说：“我过去是这样投砂，现在还是这样投砂，没有听说过什么一次投砂法。”
    十九号模范钻机就这样昙花一现，在它诞生的那一刻就已经埋下了不健康的种子。
    开会重要还是生产重要
    开会和生产本来不是对立的，开会是直接间接为了搞好生产的。可是，这个问题在十九号钻机机长杨春茂的思想上却成了很大的问题。今年年初，四二九队开全队的干部整训总结工作大会，一开就开了二十几天。领导干部当时十分强调这个大会的重要性。十九号钻机机长杨春茂也是参加者之一。开会中间，杨春茂要求到钻机上看看，分队长没有批准。等到二月份安全大检查时，领导干部发现了十九号钻机安装十分不合规格，必须重新返工，召开了许多次会议，批评杨春茂不负责任。杨春茂去年十二月到黄石市开了一星期会，回来又传达了几天，一共是十几天。当杨春茂从黄石市回来时，就看到钻机的生产情况不好，也曾向分队长反映过，但没有得到解决。杨春茂心里就有些灰心，心想：“这个机长干也可以不干也可以。”杨春茂身兼数任：机长、工会青工委员、青年团支部书记、技术研究组组长、安全检查委员，平时一天就要开一个会，又加上二十几天的总结工作的会，势必影响掌握生产的时间。领导干部没有及时发现和解决这些问题，只是在事故发生以后才开会批评杨春茂，一定要杨春茂负责：“你是机长，你就要负责！”杨春茂说：“我是机长，我应该负责，可是，我不在钻机上怎样负责呢？”领导干部认为：“不在也要负责！”杨春茂回家气得哭了几次，最后，他还是当众作了检讨。可是，他的思想上完全没有解决问题，直到现在谈起这件事来，他还说：“我也说不上开会重要还是生产重要？领导上公开宣布的事又推翻掉了。”从此以后，他就产生了一种消极的不相信领导的思想，工作更不安心。谈起这件事来，有些领导干部也想不通，他们强调对十九号钻机的工作曾作了不少的帮助。有那些帮助呢？为了照顾杨春茂事情多，特别调了一个老实人纪安普去做副机长；把“不好领导的人”设法调走；为了保持十九号机的模范称号，不叫杨春茂去打深钻；为了照顾杨春茂的情绪，让他去黄石市开会，回来时又欢迎；而安全检查时，又开了多少次会，要杨春茂承认错误等等。这些工作一件又一件地确实不少，但是，恰巧没有抓住十九号机最中心的问题，即从开始评选模范时所产生的不团结和生产上松劲的问题，以致造成今天的局面。
    值得吸取的教训
    现在，十九号钻机怎样呢？全体工人还想保持住模范钻机的称号，可是，“模范成了麻烦”的负担又压得他们透不过气来。领导干部对十九号钻机束手无策，听其发展，谈起来只觉得“伤脑筋”，并没有全部认识这次失败教训的意义。工作很忙，号召和布置一个接着一个，三月份又把第二次评选模范的工作布置下去了。这是一件值得引起注意的事，特别是在第二次评选模范中，如果领导干部和群众（尤其是领导干部）不清楚认识到以官僚主义的态度对待模范的害处，要想不重复十九号钻机所发生的情况，是十分困难的。
