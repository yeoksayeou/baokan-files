Xinhua News Agency, 18th dispatch: According to TASS news: Many factories and mines in the Soviet Union have completed their production plans for the first half of 1953 two or three weeks ahead of schedule. Dozens of factories in Moscow have already completed their half-year plans ahead of schedule. The "Barometer" factory, the "Metallurgist" factory, and many textile factories are now producing products for the second half of the year. The "Barometer" factory in Moscow completed its half-year plan on June 13th, and the factory is now able to produce five new types of precision measuring instruments. Good news of Soviet miners completing their plans ahead of schedule has also come from various mining areas. The No. 17 mine of the "Chistiakovoantratsit" Trust in the Donbass coal region completed its plan for the first half of the year as early as June 9th. The average coal output of the mine has increased by 28 percent compared to last year, reaching the level stipulated by the Five-Year Plan for 1955, and the labor productivity of coal miners has increased by 30 percent. The largest Zhdanov mine in the Karaganda coal region of the Kazakh Republic also shipped the last train of coal for this year's first half plan on the 15th. All mine shafts have adopted the advanced method of working according to the indicated charts in one cycle per day and night. Since the beginning of the year, the mine has saved more than 500,000 rubles for the state. In addition, a meat joint factory in Baku, the capital of the Azerbaijan Republic, also completed its half-year plan more than 20 days ahead of schedule in early June, with products increasing by 50 percent compared to before the war. The Kiev Machinery Factory also shipped a large number of small trucks that were overproduced on the 15th. The factory has now begun to produce 20 new types of equipment for the construction industry, including machine tools for manufacturing terracotta pipes and granite decorations, and machinery for transporting bricks.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 17th dispatch: The production of Soviet textile industry products is constantly increasing, and many giant textile enterprises are being built and renovated vigorously throughout the country. Soviet textile industry factories have successfully completed and exceeded the plan for the first five months of this year, producing a total of 27 million meters of cloth more than planned. Many textile factories are being expanded. The second part of the Stalinabad Textile Joint Factory is being built rapidly. This joint factory will add new spinning mills, weaving mills, and expand the finishing mill. After the completion of the new factory, its production capacity will almost double. In Leningrad, the printed cloth factory, which produces 65 kinds of printed cloth, is now also adding workshops, preparing to increase its output by 50 percent. The "Female Proletarian" Joint Factory, the oldest in Kalinin, has added a weaving mill and renovated the finishing mill. It is expected that this year's output will increase by more than 40 percent compared to last year. The Smolensk Flax Joint Factory, which was destroyed in the Great Patriotic War, has not only rebuilt the flax combing, spinning, and weaving factories, but also expanded the finishing mill and equipped it with a large number of the latest machinery and equipment. At the same time, many new textile enterprises are being built. A velvet woolen joint factory has been built in the eastern end of Krasnodar. This is the first large textile factory in Kuban. Now, the first part of the factory has started operation. Most of the workers are young people. Every female worker has a cultural level of seventh grade or above. The area around the factory was originally barren, but now a town has sprung up. The second part of the factory will begin construction before the end of the Fifth Five-Year Plan. A large-scale yarn factory is being built on the outskirts of Kherson, downstream of the Dnieper River. Currently, the walls of the spinning workshop are being built on the construction site. The foundations of other workshops have also been laid; workers' residences are also under construction. The future workers of the factory are studying and improving their technology in Moscow, Leningrad, and Ivanovo. At the southern end of Engels City, east of Saratov, the plant of a giant cotton textile joint factory is being built. It will be one of the largest textile enterprises in the Soviet Union.

    苏联许多厂矿提前完成半年计划
    新建和扩建许多巨型纺织工厂，产量不断增加
    【新华社十八日讯】据塔斯社消息：苏联有许多厂矿已提前两星期或三星期完成了一九五三年上半年生产计划。莫斯科目前已有几十个工厂提前完成了半年计划。“气压计”工厂、“冶金工人”工厂和许多纺织厂现在都在生产着下半年的产品。莫斯科“气压计”工厂的半年计划是在六月十三日完成的，该厂现在已能生产五种新式精确测量仪器。苏联矿工提前完成计划的捷报也纷纷从各矿区传来。顿巴斯煤区“齐斯申科汪特拉齐特”托辣斯第十七号矿场，早在六月九日就完成了上半年的计划。矿场的平均采煤量比去年提高了百分之二十八，达到了五年计划为一九五五年规定的水平，采煤工人的劳动生产率已提高了百分之三十。哈萨克共和国卡拉干达煤区最大的日丹诺夫矿场，也在十五日运出了今年上半年计划的最后一列车煤。所有矿坑都采用了一昼夜一循环按指示图表工作的先进方法。自年初以来，该矿场已为国家节省了五十多万卢布。此外，阿塞拜疆共和国首都巴库的一座肉类联合工厂，也在六月上旬提前二十多天完成了半年计划，产品比战前增多了百分之五十。基辅机械工厂也在十五日运出了超额出产的大批小型货车。这个工厂现在已开始生产二十种建筑业用的新式设备，其中有制造陶土管和花岗石装饰品的机床，运输砖块的机械等。
    【新华社莫斯科十七日电】苏联纺织工业产品的生产量不断增加，各地正在大力建筑和改建着许多巨型纺织企业。苏联纺织工业工厂已胜利地完成并超过了今年头五个月的计划，总共多生产了二千七百万公尺布匹。有许多纺织工厂正在扩充。斯大林纳巴德纺织联合工厂的第二部分正在迅速兴建。这个联合工厂将增建新纺纱厂、织布厂，并扩大整理厂。新厂落成后，它的生产能力将差不多增加二倍。在列宁格勒，出产六十五种花布的印花布工厂，现在也在增添车间，准备把产量提高百分之五十。加里宁市历史最悠久的“女无产者”联合工厂已经增建了织布厂，改建了整理厂。预计今年产量将比去年增加百分之四十以上。在卫国战争中被毁坏的斯摩棱斯克亚麻联合工厂，不仅重建了梳麻、纺麻、织麻等厂，而且还扩大了整理厂，装备了大批最新式的机器设备。和这同时，许多新的纺织企业正在兴建起来。在克拉斯诺达东端，已建筑起一座丝绒呢子联合工厂。这是库班第一座大纺织厂。现在，该厂的第一部分已经开工。大部分工人都是青年。每个女工都具有七年级以上的文化水平。工厂周围原来是荒芜的地区，现在已兴起了一个市镇。工厂的第二部分将在第五个五年计划结束前动工建筑。在第聂伯河下游的刻松市郊，正在兴建一个规模宏大的纱厂。目前，工地上正在砌纺纱车间的墙壁。其他车间的地基也已建好；工人住宅也在建筑中。该厂未来的工人正在莫斯科、列宁格勒和伊凡诺佛学习和改进技术。在萨拉托夫东面的恩格斯市南端，正在建筑一个巨型棉织联合工厂的厂房。它将是苏联最大的纺织企业之一。
