Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, June 14th. The Korean Armistice Negotiation Korean-Chinese Delegation issued the following communique on June 14th:

On June 14th, the staff officers of both sides continued administrative meetings, and it was decided to continue the meeting at 11:00 AM on the 15th.

Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, June 14th. Our special correspondent Wu Min reports: On the 15th, in addition to the staff officers holding two meetings to finalize the administrative details before the signing of the armistice agreement, liaison officers from both sides will also hold a meeting at 9:30 AM. The increase of meetings for staff officers and liaison officers to three per day indicates that the preparations for signing the armistice agreement are progressing smoothly since a complete agreement on the POW issue was reached six days ago.

Since the delegation meetings were adjourned to finalize the administrative details, staff officers have been divided into two groups, meeting simultaneously at Panmunjom every day. Over the past few days, the group of staff officers working in front of the open maps has been particularly busy, holding several meetings a day. This morning, the group of staff officers working in front of the maps began a meeting at 11:00 AM, recessed at 11:17 AM, continued the meeting at 11:40 AM, recessed again at 12:47 PM, and will hold another meeting tomorrow.

All meetings held in Panmunjom are still conducted in secret. However, the final administrative details that must be finalized before the armistice agreement is signed will include: revising the military demarcation line to conform to the current battle line; finally determining the text of the sixty-third article of the armistice agreement; and preparing for the signing ceremony of the armistice agreement.

    朝鲜谈判双方参谋人员继续开行政性会议
    【新华社开城十四日电】朝鲜停战谈判朝中代表团六月十四日发表公报如下：
    六月十四日两个双方参谋人员会议继续举行行政性会议，并定于十五日上午十一时继续开会。
    【新华社开城十四日电】本社特派记者吴敏报道：十五日除了参谋人员将举行两个会议，拟出停战协定签订前的最后行政细节外，双方联络官还将在上午九时三十分举行会议。参谋人员和联络官的会议增加到一天三个，表明六天前在战俘问题完全达成协议以后，签订停战协定的准备工作获得顺利进展。
    自从代表团会议休会以待拟出最后行政细节以来，参谋人员每天都分成两组同时在板门店举行会议。在过去几天中，双方在摊开的地图面前工作的那一组参谋人员更是特别忙，一天会谈好几次。今天早晨在地图面前工作的那一组参谋人员在十一时开始举行会议，到十一时十七分休会，在十一时四十分又继续开会，到十二时四十七分再休会，明天再举行会议。
    在板门店举行的一切会议，仍旧是秘密进行的。但是在停战协定签订前必须拟出的最后行政细节，将包括：修正军事分界线，使之符合目前的战线；最后确定停战协定六十三款的本文，和签订停战协定仪式的准备工作。
