Xinhua News Agency, Rome, June 15th: The Italian newspaper "Unità" published Palmiro Togliatti's remarks on the situation after the Italian elections. Speaking of the victory achieved by the progressive parties, Togliatti said: "Our victory is the most significant and noteworthy result of this election... We Communists, encountered the consistent tactics of the reactionaries, who mobilized reactionary trash and used the blind fear of the most backward segments of the population to oppose us. The ecclesiastical authorities carried out a campaign of intimidation that blatantly violated national laws, and we felt more than anyone else the unprecedented interference and arbitrary pressure of the government authorities. Almost all newspapers and radio stations directed their full firepower at us. Nevertheless, we have moved forward, and the results prove that more citizens support us, agree with our program, and trust us. In particular, an analysis of the election results shows that the majority of young people under the age of twenty-five, who do not have the right to vote in the Senate elections, are looking to us. It should be pointed out first of all that the anti-communist movement has suffered a serious defeat... The election results themselves prove the consolidation of our party. We call on all our organizations to use the results of this election to consolidate all our political and mass organizations, especially the Communist Party organizations, in order to establish the closest ties with the masses who voted for us and to eliminate our remaining weaknesses."

Togliatti pointed out regarding the policies that should be implemented after the election: One should not rush to draw conclusions or paint a distant future because the situation is very complex due to the existence of many contradictory factors. Anyone who truly wants to seriously assess the situation and point out the correct path forward should first consider the people's verdict. The voters condemned the fraudulent election law, which means they explicitly expressed dissatisfaction with those political activists and organizations that forced Italy to accept this election law, brought Italy's political life to a standstill for a whole year, openly undermined the legitimate rights of the legislative body, and weakened the authority of the Republic's constitution. The fraudulent election law secured seats mainly to achieve the following goals: to maintain the current government dominated by the clericals, to enable the clericals to amend the constitution for reactionary purposes, to restrict and suppress democratic freedoms, and to continue to pursue a cold war policy at home and abroad. The fraudulent election law suffered a defeat, especially as the left-wing and center parties opposing the government won about ten million votes, which should be enough to abandon the government's policy.

Togliatti continued: "The initiators of the election knew very well that in truly free elections, that is, without intimidation from the government and ecclesiastical authorities, and without fraud, the results would be more favorable to us, to the Socialist Party, and less favorable to the clerical parties. Some people have concluded, based on the number of votes and seats of the Christian Democratic Party, that nothing needs to be changed and that things should continue as before. To draw such a conclusion is to fail to see the facts and to ignore the will of the people. If the Christian Democratic Party continues in this way, there will be a long period of great confusion and either hidden or open political crisis.

"The Christian Democratic Party must understand its responsibility, move towards democracy, or at least, new forces must emerge within its ranks, understanding that the country and all parties need to do this. The Cold War against approximately ten million voters must be stopped. The intention to push the advanced parties of the people out of social life and the leadership of national policy must be abandoned forever.

"The parties should objectively compare and study their respective positions and programs and, if possible, should try to reach an agreement.

"The situation where the state apparatus and its most important institutions serve as tools for the clerical parties to deal with the people must end. Finally, a foreign policy that serves the anti-communist Americans, which severely damages our independence and exposes us to terrible war threats, should no longer be implemented. Our policy should not be manipulated by the American ambassador. Our policy should conform to the will of the people and the interests of the nation. Therefore, we propose: Unite to fight against the poverty of the people, to ease the tense international situation, and to solve major national problems. It is precisely this tense situation that the majority of the Italian people want to change."

    陶里亚蒂谈意大利选举后的情况
    号召人民继续努力以缓和国际紧张局势
    【新华社十五日讯】据塔斯社罗马十三日讯：意大利“团结报”刊载帕尔米罗·陶里亚蒂关于意大利选举后的情况的谈话。陶里亚蒂讲到进步党派获得的胜利时说：“我们的胜利是这次选举的最为巨大的和值得注意的结果……我们共产党人，碰到了反动派一贯的手法，他们动员反动垃圾和利用最落后的居民阶层的盲目恐惧来反对我们，教会当局进行的国家法律明文禁止的违法恐吓运动正是针对着我们，我们比任何人更感受到政府当局空前的干涉和专横的重压。几乎所有的报纸和电台用全部火力对准我们。虽然如此，我们向前迈进了，结果证明了又有更多的公民支持我们，赞同我们的纲领和信任我们。特别是，分析一下选举的结果就可看出，大部分没有权利在上院选举中投票的、二十五岁以下的青年们瞩望着我们。首先应当指出：反共运动已遭受到严重的失败……。选举结果的本身证明我们党的巩固。我们号召我们的一切组织利用这次选举结果来巩固我们一切政治、群众的组织，首先是共产党组织，以便与给我们投票的群众建立起最密切的联系，消除我们还存在的弱点。”
    陶里亚蒂就选举后应当执行的政策指出：不应当急急忙忙地得出结论，描绘出远景，因为，由于存在着许多矛盾的因素，局势是十分复杂的。凡是要真正严肃地估计局势和指出正确前途的人，都应当首先要考虑到人民作出的判决。选民谴责欺骗的选举法，这就是说，他们明确地表示不满那些政治活动家和组织，这些政治活动家和组织为了强迫意大利接受这个选举法，使意大利的政治生活停顿了整整一年；公开地破坏立法机关的合法权利和共和国的宪法，使得立法机关权威下降。欺骗的选举法骗取议席，主要是为了达到下列目的：维持现在教权派专权的政府，使教权派有可能修改宪法以达到反动目的，限制和压抑民主自由，继续在国内外执行冷战政策。欺骗的选举法招致失败，尤其是反对政府的左翼党派和中间党派获得约一千万张选票，就一定能够抛弃政府的这种政策。
    陶里亚蒂继续说：“选举的发起人清楚知道，在真正自由的选举下，就是说没有政府和教会当局的恐吓，没有舞弊，那么，竞选的结果对我们、对于社会党就会更为有利，而对于教会党派就会更为不利。某些人根据天主教民主党的选票数目和议席的多少，就作出了结论：什么也用不着改变，只有照着老路走。作出这样的结论，就等于是没有看到事实，没有注意到人民的意志。要是天主教民主党照着这个样子干下去，就会有一段很长时期巨大混乱和或隐蔽或公开的政治危机。
    “必须使天主教民主党明白，它的责任，走向民主，或是，至少也必须使它的队伍中出现新的力量，明白国家和所有党派需要这样做。必须停止对为数约有一千万选民的冷战。必须永远摈弃从社会生活中和国家政策的领导机构中把人民的先进党派推出去的意图。
    “各党应当客观地对照研究一下各自的立场和纲领，要是可能的话，应当设法达成协议。
    必须结束这种情况：国家机关和它的最重要机构作为教会党派对付人民的工具。最后，不应当再执行为反共的美国人服务的外交政策，这种政策使得我们的独立受到严重的损害和使我们遭到可怕的战争威胁。我们的政策不应当受美国大使的操纵。我们的政策应当符合人民的意志和民族的利益。因而我们建议：联合起来向人民的贫困进行斗争，以缓和紧张的国际局势，解决重大的民族问题。意大利大多数人民希望改变的正是这种紧张局势。”
