Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, June 22nd: The Syngman Rhee gang, increasingly rampant under the connivance of the U.S. side, abducted another group of POWs from the Sangmudae POW camp on the night of the 21st. The U.S. POW camp authorities did not explain how this group of POWs was abducted by the Syngman Rhee gang, nor would they say how many people were abducted.

Consistent with this ambiguous attitude, the commander of the Korean Transportation Zone of the U.S. POW camp headquarters, Herron, tried his best to deny that the Syngman Rhee gang had ever used tanks and trucks to transport POWs. Although the statement issued by the U.S. POW camp headquarters affirmed that the POWs were transported by trucks with the assistance of tanks by the Syngman Rhee gang, Herron insisted that the tanks and trucks that appeared near the POW camp were "only two damaged" tanks and several trucks, which were "driven there together from the firing range." Regarding Herron's statement, even reporters from the United Press could not help but question: How could Herron be sure that tanks were not used in the POWs' escape? Why would tanks be driven from the firing range to the vicinity of the POW camp in the middle of the night? Herron's spokesperson was unable to answer these two questions.

For the fourth consecutive day, the U.S. side has connived at the Syngman Rhee gang abducting a group of POWs from the POW camp, and then tried its best to cover up the truth of the incident. Is this what Clark calls "taking practical measures to find the POWs back"?

    李承晚又从尚武台战俘营押走一批战俘
    【新华社开城二十二日电】在美方纵容下越来越猖狂的李承晚匪帮，在二十一日晚上从尚武台战俘营中又押走了一批战俘。美方战俘营当局没有说明这批战俘是怎样被李承晚匪帮押走的，也不肯说明被押走的有多少人。
    和这种暧昧的态度一致的，是美方管辖战俘营司令部的朝鲜交通区司令赫伦竭力否认李承晚匪帮曾经用坦克和卡车运走战俘。虽然美方战俘司令部发表的声明肯定地说，战俘们是被李承晚匪帮在坦克协助下用卡车运走的，但是赫伦却硬说，出现在战俘营附近的“仅仅是二辆已经损坏的”坦克和几辆卡车，它们是“一同从打靶场开到该处的”。对于赫伦的声明，连合众社的记者也不能不提出疑问：赫伦怎么能够肯定在战俘脱逃的过程中没有使用坦克？怎么会在三更半夜里把坦克从打靶场开到战俘营附近？赫伦的发言人对于这两个问题都没有能够答复。
    美方接连第四天纵容李承晚匪帮从战俘营里押走一批战俘，事后又竭力掩饰事件的真相。这就是克拉克所说的“采取实际可行的措施把战俘找回来”吗？
