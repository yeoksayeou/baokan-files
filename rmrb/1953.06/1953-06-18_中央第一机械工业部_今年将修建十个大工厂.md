The Central First Ministry of Machine Building
To Build Ten Large Factories This Year

[This newspaper dispatch] This year, the Central People's Government's First Ministry of Machine Building will construct ten large factories that are crucial to the development of the national economy.

The First Ministry of Machine Building's capital construction investment this year is 2.8 times that of last year, with half of it being used for these ten key projects. Among these ten key projects, four are newly built factories: Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Factory, No. 652 Automobile Manufacturing Factory, Northeast Cutting Tool and Measuring Tool Factory, and Northeast Electrical Engineering Factory No. 4; six are renovated and expanded factories: Fushun Electrical and Mechanical Factory, Northeast Machinery Factory No. 1, Northeast Machinery Factory No. 2, Northeast Electrical Engineering Factory No. 7, Northeast Pneumatic Tool Factory, and a shipyard.

The old machine factories in our country were basically repair shops and could not manufacture machines. After more than three years of renovation and adjustment, most of these factories are now able to manufacture machines, and the quantity and variety of production have increased, and the quality has also improved. However, from the perspective of national construction needs, my country's machine industry is still very backward, with few varieties and low output. Most of the medium-sized, large-sized, and high-precision machines cannot be manufactured. After the ten factories planned to be built this year are successfully constructed, this situation will be initially changed.

The Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Factory is the first newly built medium and heavy machinery manufacturing factory in our country, and it is planned to be completed in 1955. It will manufacture large-scale rolling steel equipment and coking equipment, and manufacture medium and heavy-duty bridge cranes. The No. 652 Automobile Manufacturing Factory is the first automobile manufacturing factory in our country. All of its advanced technology and equipment from the Soviet Union are adopted, and the production process is mechanized and automated. The construction of this factory is of great significance for strengthening transportation work in planned economic construction and consolidating national defense. The Northeast Cutting Tool and Measuring Tool Factory, the first factory in our country to manufacture precision cutting tools and measuring tools, will be completed in 1954. Cutting tools and measuring tools are indispensable tools in the machinery manufacturing industry, but most of the cutting tools and measuring tools used in our country now have to be purchased from abroad. After the Northeast Cutting Tool and Measuring Tool Factory is put into production, this problem can be partially solved. The Northeast Electrical Engineering Factory No. 4 started construction in 1951 and will be completed in 1955. The electrical appliance industry is a relatively weak link in my country's various industries, and the manufacture of power generation equipment is even more backward. Until now, my country does not have a factory that can mass-produce medium and large-sized power generation equipment. After the Northeast Electrical Engineering Factory No. 4 is completed, it will specialize in mass-producing medium and large-sized hydro-turbogenerators and thermal power generators. Part of the power stations to be built in my country's first five-year plan will obtain the required equipment from this factory.

The six factories including Fushun Electrical and Mechanical Factory, Northeast Machinery Factory No. 1, Northeast Machinery Factory No. 2, Northeast Pneumatic Tool Factory, and Northeast Electrical Engineering Factory No. 7 are being renovated and expanded on the original basis. The Fushun Electrical and Mechanical Factory started construction this year and will be completed the year after next. It will manufacture large-scale mining machinery, which will have a great effect on accelerating the development of my country's fuel industry and ferrous and non-ferrous metal industries. The renovation projects of Northeast Machinery Factory No. 1, Machinery Factory No. 2, and Pneumatic Tool Factory all started this year and will be completed next year. Machinery Factory No. 1 will manufacture medium-sized lathes that are urgently needed in my country's industry. Machinery Factory No. 2 will supply crushers and ball mills needed by the iron and steel industry and the non-ferrous metal industry. The Pneumatic Tool Factory will manufacture various types of pneumatic tools directly used in capital construction, such as riveting machines, rock drills, and pneumatic shovels. The renovation project of Northeast Electrical Engineering Factory No. 7 started this year and will be completed the year after next. It will produce wires and cables that are urgently needed in capital construction. After these factories are renovated and expanded, their appearance will be fundamentally changed. For example, the Fushun Electrical and Mechanical Factory was originally only a factory that made some repair parts for coal mines. After renovation and expansion, the factory buildings will increase by 2.2 times, and the annual output will be 3.5 times higher than the current highest annual output; the products are not only repaired parts, but also huge mining machinery. For example, a three-cubic-meter electric shovel weighs 150 tons, and each dig is almost equal to one person's work for a day. The renovation projects of Northeast Machinery Factory No. 1 and Electrical Engineering Factory No. 7 are designed by Soviet experts, and the technology is very advanced. The entire production process is a assembly line, and the machines used are also new. Soviet experts have given thorough consideration to the safety and welfare of workers, so fire prevention, thermal insulation, and technical security equipment are very complete.

    中央第一机械工业部
    今年将修建十个大工厂
    【本报讯】今年，中央人民政府第一机械工业部将修建十个对国民经济的发展有决定意义的大工厂。
    第一机械工业部今年的基本建设投资相当于去年的二点八倍，其中有一半是用在这十个重点工程上。这十个重点工程中，有四个是新建设的工厂，即太原重型机器厂、六五二汽车制造厂、东北刃具量具厂和东北电工四厂；有六个是改建和扩建的工厂，即抚顺机电厂、东北机械一厂、东北机械二厂、东北电工七厂、东北风动工具厂和一个造船厂。
    我国旧有的各机器厂，基本上是修配厂，不能制造机器。经过三年多来的改造和调整，现在这些工厂大都能够制造机器了，而且生产的数量和品种有增加，质量也有提高。但是，从国家建设的需要来说，我国的机器工业还是十分落后的，品种和产量都少，中型的、大型的和精密度高的机器大部不能制造。今年计划修建的这十个工厂建设成功以后，这种情况就将初步改变。
    太原重型机器厂是我国新建的第一个中型和重型机器制造厂，计划一九五五年建成。它将制造大型的轧钢设备和炼焦设备，制造中型和重型的桥式吊车。六五二汽车制造厂是我国第一座汽车制造厂，全部采用苏联先进的技术和设备，生产过程都是机械化、自动化的。这个工厂的兴建，对于加强有计划的经济建设中的运输工作和巩固国防都有重大的意义。我国第一个制造精密的刃具和量具的工厂——东北刃具量具工厂，将在一九五四年建成。刃具、量具是机械制造业中不可缺少的工具，但是我国现在所用的刃具和量具大部分要向国外购买，东北刃具量具厂投入生产后，就可以部分地解决这个问题。东北电工四厂从一九五一年开始建设，将在一九五五年建成。电器工业是我国各种工业中比较薄弱的一环，其中发电设备的制造更加落后，直到现在，我国还没有一个能够大量制造中型和大型发电设备的工厂。东北电工四厂建成后，就将专门大量制造中型和大型的水轮发电机和火力发电机。我国第一个五年计划中所要建设的一部分电站，就将从这个工厂得到所需的设备。
    抚顺机电厂、东北机械一厂、东北机械二厂、东北风动工具厂、东北电工七厂等六个工厂是在原有的基础上改建和扩建的。抚顺机电厂今年开始建设，后年完成。它将制造大型的矿山机械，对加速我国燃料工业、黑色及有色金属工业的发展，将有极大作用。东北机械一厂、机械二厂和风动工具厂的改建工程，都是从今年开始，明年完成。机械一厂将制造我国工业上迫切需要的中型车床。机械二厂将供给钢铁工业和有色金属工业所需要的破碎机和球磨机。风动工具厂将制造各式直接用于基本建设的风动工具，如铆钉机、凿岩机、风铲等。东北电工七厂的改建工程从今年开始，后年完成。它将生产基本建设中迫切需要的电线和电缆。这些工厂经过改建和扩建以后，面貌将根本改变。如抚顺机电厂原来只是给煤矿作一些修配部件的工厂，经过改建和扩建后，厂房将增加二点二倍，年产量要比现在的最高年产量高三倍半；产品也不只是修配的部件，而是巨型的矿山机械。如三立方公尺的电铲，有一百五十吨重，每挖一次土几乎等于一个人的一天工作量。东北机械一厂和电工七厂的改建工程，都是由苏联专家设计的，技术方面很先进，全部生产过程都是流水作业，采用的机器也是新式的。电工七厂原来只生产电线，改建和扩建后，产量和品种都将大大增加：橡皮线将增加十二倍，压延及拉线将增加五倍，并可生产电讯电缆。同时，苏联专家对工人的安全和福利考虑得很周到，因此，防火、保暖及技术保安设备都很完善。
