Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, 3rd – Zhejiang Province has comprehensively launched a pilot program for grassroots elections. As of now, 137 townships and towns across the province are conducting pilot elections. Seventeen pilot townships in twelve counties, including Hang County, Fuyang, and Jiashan, have completed the work of population survey and voter registration. Most of the remaining pilot townships are carrying out propaganda and education, dividing electoral districts, and preparing for population surveys and voter registration.

In carrying out the pilot grassroots elections, all counties have grasped the principle of not hindering production, closely integrating the pilot elections with production. After the election work teams of most counties arrived in the pilot townships, they first convened meetings of all township and village cadres and active elements among the masses. On the one hand, they studied the policies and methods of the general election, so that grassroots cadres understood the great significance of the general election; on the other hand, they started with inspecting and leading production, combined it with extensive publicity about the election, and made all preparations for the election. The work teams themselves also appropriately drew out a portion of their strength to specifically manage a mutual aid team, using the method of "creating experience to promote comprehensiveness" to do a good job in production and election work. After the Fenghua County election work team arrived in Shujia Township in the county, the township was facing a drought. The work team vigorously mobilized the masses to fight the drought, protect seedlings, and rush planting, and initially resolved the historical water conservancy disputes between Shujia and Wudun villages, helped Mentou village install water pumps, and develop water sources, ensuring the seedling protection work for 400 mu of early autumn crops in the village. In leading production, they also combined it with election propaganda. Therefore, the enthusiasm of the masses in the whole township was very high, and the villages were filled with a joyous atmosphere in welcoming the general election.

In leading production, pilot townships in various counties combined it with election propaganda at any time and any place, thereby also promoting production. Some cadres in Changshan Township, Fuyang County, helped the masses with production in the fields during the day, conducted field propaganda, and used their spare time in the evening to hold forums for fishermen and handicraft workers to conduct in-depth propaganda. They also mobilized propagandists throughout the township to go deep into mutual aid teams to conduct propaganda, so that the vast majority of the masses in Changshan Township understood the great significance of the general election. Through election propaganda, Hejia Township in Changshan County increased women's enthusiasm for production and implemented the principle of equal pay for equal work for men and women within the mutual aid teams. A total of 250 women in the township participated in summer harvesting and planting.

In carrying out the work of population survey and voter registration, the grassroots election pilot townships in various counties made sufficient preparations in advance, so that this work was carried out quickly without delaying production. After the election work teams of Hang County, Fuyang County, and other counties arrived in the pilot townships, they first grasped the original household registration books of the townships, and jointly verified and discussed with the township cadres and voter qualification review teams to first have a clear understanding in their minds. Then, relying on the mutual aid teams (absorbing individual farmers to participate) or through farmer family meetings, they mobilized them to prepare drafts of everyone's date of birth and name in advance. During registration, the two parties compared them, and the registration was completed quickly. The work teams also arranged the order of registration. Disputes over voter qualifications were generally left to be handled individually after the vast majority of voters had been registered.

After being publicized, the masses in the grassroots election pilot townships in various counties expressed their warm support for the general election. Voters took good care of and valued the voter certificates they received. An old woman in her sixties in Bainiushan Township, Changhua County, said: "I will put this voter certificate in a box and take good care of it. When the election comes, if I can't walk, I will ask someone to carry me to the election." When the farmers in Dong'an Township, Hang County, went to register, they happily put on new clothes. Sun Caihong, an old lady in her seventies, used to scold anyone who asked her to attend a meeting. This time, she put on new clothes and rushed to the survey registration station early in the morning to wait.

    浙江基层选举典型试办工作展开
    正确掌握不误生产的原则受到群众的欢迎
    【新华社杭州三日电】浙江省基层选举的典型试办工作已全面展开。截至目前为止，全省已有一百三十七个乡、镇正在进行普选的试办工作。杭县、富阳、嘉善等十二个县的十七个试办乡已经完成了人口调查与选民登记等工作，其余大部分试办乡正在进行宣传教育、划分选区以及办理人口调查和选民登记的准备工作。
    各县在进行基层普选试办的工作中，都掌握了不误生产的原则，使试办普选与生产紧密地结合进行。大部分县的普选工作队到达试办乡之后，首先就召开全体乡、村干部和群众积极分子会议，一方面学习普选的政策与做法，使基层干部了解到普选的重大意义；一方面从检查生产、领导生产着手，结合进行有关普选的广泛宣传，做好有关普选的一切准备工作。工作队本身也适当抽出一部分力量，具体掌握一个互助组，运用“创造经验，推动全面”的方法，来做好生产与普选工作。奉化县普选工作队在到达该县的舒家乡后，该乡正面临旱灾，工作队就大力发动群众进行抗旱、保苗、抢种，初步解决了舒家、吴墩二村历史性的水利纠纷问题，帮助门头村装置打水机，开辟水源，保证了该村四百亩早秋的保苗工作。在领导生产中，他们又结合进行普选的宣传，因此，全乡群众情绪都很高，各村都充满了迎接普选的喜气洋洋的景象。
    各县试办乡在领导生产中，都随时随地结合进行普选的宣传，从而又推动了生产。富阳县长山乡的部分干部白天下田帮助群众生产，进行田间宣传，晚上利用空闲时间，又分别召开渔民、手工业者的座谈会，进行深入宣传，并且还发动全乡的宣传员，分头深入互助组宣传，这样使长山乡绝大部分群众都了解了普选的重大意义。常山县何家乡通过普选宣传，提高了妇女生产积极性，并在互助组内贯彻了男女同工同酬的原则，全乡共有二百五十名妇女投入夏收、夏种。
    各县基点乡在进行人口调查与选民登记的工作中，大部分在事前作好了充分的准备，因此使这项工作进行得既迅速，又不耽误生产。杭县、富阳等县的普选工作队到达试办乡之后，首先就掌握住各乡原有的户口册，和乡干部及选民资格审查小组共同核对讨论，首先做到心中有数；然后依靠互助组
    （吸收单干农民参加）或通过农民家庭会议，动员他们事先拟好每个人的出生年月、姓名的草稿，到登记时，双方一对照，就很快地登记了。工作队还把登记的次序排列好，关于选民资格的争论问题，一般都留待绝大部分选民登记结束后，再个别处理。
    各县基层选举试办乡的群众受到宣传以后，对普选都表示热烈的拥护。选民领到了选民证，都非常爱护与重视。昌化县白牛乡一位六十余岁的老太婆说：“我要把这张选民证好好的放在箱子里，到选举的时候，我不能走，请人背着也要去选举。”杭县东安乡的农民去登记的时候，都兴高采烈地换上新衣。七十多岁的老太太孙彩虹过去谁叫她开会就骂谁，这次登记时，她换上新衣，一清早就赶到调查登记站去等候。
