    Friendship
    Wang Xiaochou

    This was in May of 1951, when the Fifth Phase Offensive had already begun. Our Volunteer Army unit had just crossed the Imjin River, and day was about to break. To avoid air raids, we all quickly ran into a mountain gully.

    Comrade Zhang Hongsheng of the cooking squad was carrying a field kitchen pot on his back, walking at the rear. As he walked, he suddenly discovered a person lying on the road, who looked like a soldier from the Korean People's Army. He walked closer for a careful look, and oh my! It was indeed him. This person was covered in blood, with four or five wounds. His thigh was blown off, and the ribs on his chest were broken. Because of excessive blood loss, his face was sallow, and he couldn't even open his eyes. He thought: The rescue team must not have arrived yet. So, he asked him in Korean, "Comrade, how are you?" The wounded soldier slowly opened his eyes and looked at him, then looked at the sky, and shook his head, meaning, "You should leave quickly! I'm not going to make it. Don't wait for the planes to come and bomb us together." At this moment, Zhang Hongsheng's tears streamed down. He thought, "I would rather be bombed to death here than leave this severely wounded Korean comrade here unattended!" Immediately, he took out a first-aid kit from his bag and gently wiped the blood from the wounded soldier's wounds with his own towel, then applied the medicated cloth. Then, he gently carried the wounded soldier on his back and ran five or six *li*, found a sheltered place, and slowly put the wounded soldier down. Afraid that the planes would see him, he pulled a lot of dry grass to camouflage the wounded soldier, before taking a breath and wiping the sweat from his face. At this point, he felt that this wasn't good enough. "If you're going to help, do it thoroughly." So, he simply took out the small iron shovel he had picked up from the American devils and dug an air-raid shelter nearby. Seeing that the cave was very damp, he thought, "I can't let the wounded suffer." So he took off his cotton-padded coat and laid it in the air-raid shelter, gently carried the wounded soldier into the air-raid shelter. Seeing that the wounded soldier had nothing to rest his head on, he gently lifted his head and used his bag as a pillow, before breathing a sigh of relief and saying, "Now there's nothing to fear."

    The cook platoon leader came with a bowl of fried noodles and a small can of water, and said to Zhang Hongsheng: "We have been looking for you for a long time, why don't you go to eat? We have to leave to fight this afternoon, you are tired carrying the pot, everyone asked me to bring you more to eat." Zhang Hongsheng was very hungry, but he stopped after taking a bite of the bowl, because he thought of the wounded. He ran to the air-raid shelter and whispered to the wounded soldier: "Comrade, are you hungry, eat some fried noodles!" The wounded soldier opened his eyes and slowly said in broken Chinese: "I don't eat, you eat, so you can fight the American devils. I will eat after I get to the rear." "No, it doesn't matter if I'm a little hungry, how can you bear such a heavy injury?" Zhang Hongsheng said, picking up a small copper spoon and feeding the fried noodles to the wounded soldier's mouth spoonful by spoonful. The wounded soldier was so moved that tears flowed down the corners of his eyes, and he murmured, "You are even closer than my own parents."

    The American planes came, firing machine guns and dropping bombs towards this mountain. Shrapnel flew all over the place. He moved the wounded soldier further inside, but he crawled to the entrance of the shelter. The wounded soldier said, "Come inside!" "No, I'll stay here. I can't let you get hurt a second time." At this moment, the wounded soldier looked very excited, but he couldn't speak.

    It was getting dark, and the rescue team arrived. He carried the wounded soldier down the mountain and handed him over to the rescue team, saying: "You hurry up and take him down, his injuries are very serious, we are about to leave." He also said to the wounded soldier: "You have a good rest, and when your injury is healed, let's go fight the American devils together." The wounded soldier gritted his teeth, stretched out his wounded right arm, and tightly held Zhang Hongsheng's hand, saying, "You go, Comrade. I can only recover quickly and return to the front to eliminate the American devils to repay you. Now I'm going back to the rear to recuperate. When I get to the rear, I will definitely tell the children to never forget the kindness of the Chinese People's Volunteers." (Attached picture)

    这是一九五一年的五月间，五次战役已经开始。我们志愿军某部刚渡过临津江，天要大亮了。为了避免空袭，我们都很快地跑进一个山沟里。
    炊事班的张洪生同志，背着口行军大锅，走在后面。走着，走着，他忽然发现公路上躺着个人，看样子好像朝鲜人民军。他走到跟前，仔细一看，哎呀！正是，这个人浑身血淋淋的，有四五处伤，大腿都炸断了，胸脯上的肋条也被打断了，因为流血过多，脸焦黄，连眼都睁不开了。他想：这准是救护队还没来呢。于是，他就用朝鲜话问他：“同志，怎么样？”伤员慢慢地睁开眼看了看他，看了看天，又摇了摇头，意思是说：“你快走吧！我不行了，不要等着飞机来了一块炸着。”这时候张洪生的眼泪流出来了。他想：“我宁愿叫飞机炸死在这里，也不能把这受了重伤的朝鲜同志扔在这儿不管呀！”他紧接着就从挎包里掏出一个救急包来，并且用自己的手巾，轻轻地给伤员把伤口的血擦干净，再拿药布缠好。然后他又把伤员轻轻地背起来，一气跑了五六里地，找了个避风的地方，把伤员慢慢地放下。他又怕飞机看见，就拔了许多干枯的草给伤员伪装好，才喘了口气，擦了擦脸上的汗。这时候，他又觉得这还不妥，“要帮助，就彻底。”索性解下他拣的美国鬼子的小铁锨来，在附近挖了个防空洞。看了看洞里很潮，他想：“我决不能让伤员受罪。”于是又把自己的棉袄脱下来，铺在防空洞里，轻轻地把伤员抱到防空洞里。看伤员没有枕的，就用两手微微搬了搬他的头，把自己的挎包给垫上，才松了口气说：“这就不怕了。”
    炊事班长端着一碗炒面，提着一小罐水走来，对张洪生说：“我们找了你好久了，怎么你不去吃饭呢？下午还得出发打仗，你背着锅很累，大家叫我多给你送点来，吃吧。”张洪生本来很饿，可是，端起碗来吃了一口就停住了，原来他又想起了伤员。他连忙跑到防空洞里小声地对伤员说：“同志，你饿了吧，吃点炒面吧！”伤员睁开眼，慢吞吞地用不熟练的中国话说：“我不吃，你吃吧，好打美国鬼子。我到后方再吃吧。”“不能，我饿着点不要紧，你挂这么重的花还顶得住？”张洪生说着，就拿起小铜杓一杓一杓地把炒面送到伤员嘴里，感动得伤员眼泪顺着眼角往下流着，并且喃喃地说：“你真比我的亲爹亲妈还亲。”
    美国飞机来啦，向这个山又打机枪，又投弹，弹片嗖嗖地在头上乱飞，他把伤员往里搬了搬，自己却爬在洞口上。伤员说：“里边来吧！”“不，就在这里，我不能叫你再负第二次伤。”这时候伤员看样子非常激动，但他说不出话。
    天黑了，救护队来啦，他把伤员背下山，交给救护队说：“你们赶快把他抬下去吧，他的伤挺厉害，我们快要出发了。”又对伤员说：“你好好休养吧，等伤好了咱们再一块去打美国鬼子。”伤员咬着牙，伸出那挂了花的右臂，紧紧地握住张洪生的手说：“你去吧，同志。我只有很快养好伤，再回到前方，消灭美国鬼子来报答你吧。现在我回后方去休养，到了后方，我一定跟孩子们说，让他们永远都不能忘了中国人民志愿军的恩情。”（附图片）
