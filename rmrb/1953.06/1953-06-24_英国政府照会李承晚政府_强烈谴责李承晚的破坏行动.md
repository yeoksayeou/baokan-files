Xinhua News Agency, London, June 23rd: British Prime Minister Winston Churchill read a note from the British government to the Syngman Rhee government in the House of Commons on June 22nd. The note strongly condemned Syngman Rhee's sabotage in "releasing" prisoners of war.

The note stated: "Her Majesty's Government was greatly shocked to see the statement issued by the President of South Korea, Syngman Rhee, on June 18th. In the statement, Syngman Rhee said that he had arbitrarily ordered the release of certain Korean prisoners of war. Her Majesty's Government is deeply concerned to see the subsequent events of thousands of prisoners of war escaping from prisoner-of-war camps under the jurisdiction of the United Nations Command.

"As a member of the United Nations with troops participating in the Korean War, Her Majesty's Government strongly condemns this act of betrayal that violates the authority of the United Nations Command, an authority that Korea agreed to in 1950."

The note stated that the British government "is anxiously watching the development of events which may have serious consequences."

The note believes that "unless Korea has a government willing to cooperate loyally with the United Nations Command," all achievements will be jeopardized.

Churchill said in the House of Commons that "the situation is obviously very serious and fraught with danger." "In my opinion, we must express a firm attitude." "It now seems very wise to recover the released prisoners of war - as demanded by the Chinese and North Korean Communists."

Churchill's criticism of the Syngman Rhee clique was applauded by members of the House of Commons.

    英国政府照会李承晚政府
    强烈谴责李承晚的破坏行动
    【新华社二十三日讯】伦敦消息：英国首相邱吉尔于六月二十二日在下议院宣读了英国政府致李承晚政府的照会。照会强烈地谴责李承晚“释放”战俘的破坏行动。
    照会说：“女王政府看到韩国总统李承晚在六月十八日发表的声明后大为震惊。李承晚在声明中说，他已自作主张地下令释放某些朝鲜战俘。女王政府看到后来发生的若干联合国军司令部管辖下的俘虏营中成千上万的战俘逃跑的事件，深切地感到忧虑。
    “作为一个有军队参加朝鲜战争的联合国的成员，女王政府强烈谴责这种侵犯联合国军司令部的权限的背叛行为，这种权限是韩国在一九五○年曾经同意的。”
    照会说：英国政府“焦急地注视着这种可能产生严重后果的事件的发展”。
    照会认为，“除非韩国有一个愿意和联合国军司令部忠诚合作的政府”，否则一切成果将遭受危害。
    邱吉尔在下议院说，“事态显然非常严重并充满着危险。”“照我看来，我们必须表示坚定的态度”。“现在看来，追回被释放的战俘——像中国与北朝鲜共方所要求的——是十分明智之举。”
    邱吉尔对李承晚集团的抨击受到下议院议员们的欢呼。
