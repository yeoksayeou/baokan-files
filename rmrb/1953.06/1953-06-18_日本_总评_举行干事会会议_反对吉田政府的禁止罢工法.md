Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo: The Japanese working class is preparing to rise up and fight back against the Yoshida government's reactionary measures, such as the formulation of an anti-strike law.

The General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (referred to as "Sohyo"), the largest trade union organization in Japan, held an executive committee meeting on the 6th. In response to the situation where the Yoshida government will submit fascist bills such as the anti-strike law to the Diet around June 20th, the meeting discussed and determined the fighting policy.

The executive committee meeting determined that "Sohyo" will fight against the Yoshida government's anti-strike law. In order to fight back against this fascist bill, "Sohyo" will put forward demands for increased wages and the issuance of summer allowances, and will simultaneously hold general mobilization rallies across the country to launch a struggle to realize these demands.
