Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, June 25th: A grand meeting commemorating the third anniversary of the Fatherland Liberation War of Korea was held in Pyongyang on the evening of the 24th. Attending the meeting were Kim Tu-bong, Park Jung-ai, He Gayi, Park Chang-ok, Jung Il-ryong, Choi Yong-kun and other leaders of the Korean Party, government, and military, heads of various democratic parties and social organizations, senior generals of the Korean People's Army, combat heroes, labor heroes from the Pyongyang area, and representatives from all walks of life, totaling over a thousand people. Diplomatic envoys from various brother countries stationed in Korea were also invited to attend. A delegation of 34 members from the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, headed by General Zhang Nansheng, was also invited to participate in the meeting.

Choi Jong-hak, Director of the General Political Bureau of the Korean People's Army, delivered a report at the meeting. He pointed out: The Korean military and civilians have waged a heroic struggle and achieved great victories over the past three years. The joint operations of the Korean and Chinese people's armies have dealt annihilating blows to the enemy. The superior strategies and tactics of the Korean and Chinese people's armies and the heroic and tenacious spirit of the vast number of combatants will forever shine in our war history. As of May 25 this year, 431 Heroes of the Republic and 488,239 recipients of medals and orders have emerged in the Korean People's Army. He pointed out that the reasons for the victory were the wise leadership of Marshal Kim Il-sung and the application of Stalin's scientific strategy, which cultivated a large number of excellent military cadres; the unparalleled heroic struggle of the Korean military and civilians and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army; the great achievements and superiority of the people's democratic system of the Republic during the period of peaceful construction; and the warm support of the people of democratic countries, headed by the Soviet people. Under the leadership of the great Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong, the fraternal Chinese people not only provided spiritual and material assistance to the Korean people but also dispatched heroic volunteer forces to Korea to fight, demonstrating a new example of internationalist assistance. The Chinese People's Volunteer Army cherished and respected every mountain, river, tree, and blade of grass in Korea, and fought closely alongside the Korean People's Army, displaying unparalleled heroism and bravery. The Korean people express their warm gratitude and honor to the heroic commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Chinese Communist Party and its leader, Chairman Mao Zedong, who have aided us with their blood. When Choi Jong-hak reported to this point, the entire audience stood up and burst into prolonged applause.

Choi Jong-hak then emphasized that due to our consistent efforts, the only obstacle to achieving a Korean armistice has been removed, and an agreement on the repatriation of prisoners of war has been signed. However, before the ink was dry on the signatures, the Syngman Rhee gang, with the connivance of the US side, "released" our captured personnel, attempting to incorporate them into the Syngman Rhee puppet army. This has aroused the indignation of kind people all over the world. The US side must clearly express its attitude, and if it is sincere in achieving an armistice, it should immediately take corresponding measures. Choi Jong-hak called on the commanders and fighters of the Korean People's Army and the Korean people to unite more closely around the Party and the leader, further heighten their vigilance, strengthen the struggle for the realization of the armistice and the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue, strengthen the friendship and solidarity with the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the peace-loving people of the world, headed by the Soviet and Chinese peoples, and advance more bravely towards victory.

General Zhang Nansheng, the chief representative of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army delegation, delivered a speech at the meeting. On behalf of Commander Peng Dehuai and all commanders and fighters of the Volunteer Army, he extended his highest respect to the heroic Korean people and their beloved leader Marshal Kim Il-sung, who have defended the independence of their country and made great contributions to the cause of world peace. He pointed out the great and unbreakable unity of the Korean and Chinese people's armies and the great victories that have been achieved. He said: We have always advocated reaching a Korean armistice agreement on a fair and reasonable basis to open the way for a peaceful settlement of the Korean issue. However, the anti-armistice elements in the United States and the Syngman Rhee clique have consistently delayed and disrupted the negotiations. Just ten days after an agreement was reached on the issue of prisoner of war repatriation, the "United Nations Command" actually connived with the Syngman Rhee clique to forcibly remove more than 26,000 captured personnel of the Korean People's Army from prisoner of war camps around the 18th to the 20th, implementing forced detention and seriously undermining the agreement. This blatant act of undermining the agreement and forcibly detaining prisoners of war once again tells us that the Syngman Rhee bandits and the anti-armistice elements in the United States who support them are still painstakingly obstructing and sabotaging the armistice. We must remain vigilant at all times, smash any shameless schemes of the enemy, and strive for the realization of a Korean armistice and for a peaceful settlement of the Korean issue.

Then, the Volunteer Army delegation presented the meeting with a huge banner respectfully presented by Commander Peng Dehuai leading all commanders and fighters of the Volunteer Army. The banner was embroidered with the words: "Long live the unbreakable fighting friendship between the Chinese and Korean peoples forged in blood!"

The meeting finally adopted congratulatory telegrams to Chairman Malenkov, Premier Kim Il-sung, and Chairman Mao Zedong.

    纪念朝鲜祖国解放战争三周年
    平壤市各界隆重举行报告大会
    【新华社平壤二十五日电】平壤市纪念祖国解放战争三周年报告大会，在二十四日晚间隆重举行。出席大会的有，金枓奉、朴正爱、许嘉谊、朴昌玉、郑一龙、崔庸健等朝鲜党、政、军首长，各民主政党、社会团体负责人，朝鲜人民军高级将领、战斗英雄，平壤地区的劳动英雄和各界人民代表等共一千多人。各兄弟国家驻朝鲜的外交使节都应邀到会。以张南生将军为首的中国人民志愿军代表团一行三十四人，也应邀参加了大会。
    朝鲜人民军总政治局局长崔宗学在大会上作报告。他指出：朝鲜军民三年来进行了英雄的斗争，取得巨大的胜利。朝中人民军队的并肩作战，给了敌人以歼灭性的打击。朝中人民军队优越的战略战术和广大战斗员的英勇顽强精神，将在我们的战争史上永远放射光芒。到今年五月二十五日为止，朝鲜人民军中涌现出四百三十一名共和国英雄和四十八万八千二百三十九名勋章和奖章获得者。他指出：取得胜利的原因是由于金日成元帅的英明领导和应用斯大林的科学战略，培养了大批优秀的军事干部；朝鲜军民和中国人民志愿军的英勇无双的斗争；共和国人民民主制度在和平建设时期所取得的巨大成就及其优越性；以苏联人民为首的各民主国家人民的热烈声援。兄弟般的中国人民在伟大的中国共产党和毛泽东主席的领导下，不但在精神上和物质上援助朝鲜人民，而且派遣英雄的志愿军部队入朝作战，表现了国际主义援助的新榜样。中国人民志愿军爱护与尊重朝鲜的一山一水、一草一木，和朝鲜人民军紧密地并肩作战，发挥了无比英雄与勇敢的精神。朝鲜人民要向以鲜血援助我们的英雄的中国人民志愿军指战员和中国共产党及其领袖毛泽东主席，致以热烈的感谢与荣誉。当崔宗学报告到这里时，全场起立，响起了经久不息的掌声。
    崔宗学接着强调说：由于我方一贯的努力，扫除了实现朝鲜停战的唯一障碍，签订了关于战俘遣返问题的协议。但是，签字的墨迹未干，李承晚匪帮就在美方纵容下“释放”我方被俘人员，企图把他们编入李承晚伪军。这已引起了全世界善良人们的激愤。美方必须明确地表示自己的态度，如有诚意实现停战，那就应立即采取相应的措施。崔宗学号召朝鲜人民军指挥员、战斗员和朝鲜人民，更紧密地团结在党和领袖的周围，进一步提高警惕，加强为停战实现及朝鲜问题和平解决的斗争，加强和中国人民志愿军及以苏联人民与中国人民为首的全世界爱好和平人民的友谊团结，更勇敢地向胜利前进。
    中国人民志愿军代表团首席代表张南生将军在会上致词。他代表彭德怀司令员和全体志愿军指挥员、战斗员，向保卫祖国独立并对世界和平事业作了伟大贡献的英雄的朝鲜人民及其敬爱的领袖金日成元帅，致以崇高的敬礼。他指出了朝中人民军队的伟大的牢不可破的团结和已经取得的巨大胜利。他说：我们一向主张在公平合理的基础上达成朝鲜停战协议，以打开和平解决朝鲜问题的道路。但是美国的反停战分子和李承晚集团却一贯地拖延和破坏谈判。就在战俘遣返问题方达成协议还不过十天的时候，“联合国军”司令部竟纵容李承晚集团在十八日到二十日前后强迫二万六千名以上的朝鲜人民军被俘人员离开战俘营，实行强迫扣留，严重地破坏了协议。这种明目张胆的破坏协议强迫扣留战俘的猖狂行为，再一次告诉我们：李承晚匪徒以及支持他们的美国的反停战分子仍在处心积虑地阻挠和破坏停战。我们不论在任何时候都应提高警惕，粉碎敌人任何无耻的阴谋，为实现朝鲜停战，为和平解决朝鲜问题而奋斗。
    接着，志愿军代表把彭德怀司令员率志愿军全体指挥员、战斗员敬赠的巨幅锦旗献给大会。锦旗上绣着：“中朝人民以鲜血凝结成的牢不可破的战斗友谊万岁！”
    大会最后通过了给马林科夫主席、金日成首相和毛泽东主席的致敬电。
