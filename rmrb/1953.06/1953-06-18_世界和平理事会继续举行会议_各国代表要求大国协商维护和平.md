Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, June 17th: The World Peace Council continued its meeting on June 16th, chaired by Dabo Sai.

    Vincent Massey, Chairman of the Canadian Peace Congress and member of the World Peace Council, spoke first. In his speech, he discussed the tasks of the Canadian peace movement, pointing out that its main purpose is to promote an agreement among the five major powers to declare that they will never wage war against each other.

    Dr. Massey believes that a people's vote should be held worldwide to show governments that the people demand consultations leading to peace.

    Massey mentioned the speeches of Churchill, the Archbishop of York, and others, as well as the recent resolutions passed by the Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference. He emphasized that there is no doubt now that consultations are necessary and possible. It is important to eliminate the threat of war and the threat of the use of force.

    He pointed out that the wars currently being waged in the colonies threaten peace. Dr. Massey said that a Magna Carta needs to be won for the people of Africa and other colonies, allowing them to freely decide against allowing a minority of rulers to enjoy privileges.

    The next speaker was Boucek, a metalworker from Czechoslovakia and a member of the World Peace Council. He said: The people of Czechoslovakia sincerely desire peace and believe that all issues can be resolved through consultation. The Czechoslovak government and people have consistently adopted a policy of maintaining peaceful and friendly relations with all countries. We believe that the German issue can be resolved based on the principles of the Potsdam Agreement, and by concluding a peace treaty with Germany, according to the proposals of the Soviet government, which strictly adheres to this agreement. This agreement has not been observed in West Germany, where remilitarization is underway, revanchist sentiments are reviving, and war bases have been established. This is something we cannot agree to. All of this endangers the security of our country and all of Germany's neighbors. Czechoslovakia suggests that the entire Germany should fully comply with the principles of the Potsdam Agreement; resume negotiations for a peace treaty with Germany; and declare the "General Treaty" and the "European Defense Community" treaty invalid, as these are aggressive treaties.

    The next speaker was Riccardo Lombardi of Italy, a member of the World Peace Council, who spoke about the economic situation in capitalist countries and the possibility of expanding world trade and easing international tensions.

    Pastor Martin Niemöller, a West German representative invited to attend the meeting of the World Peace Council, spoke about the issue of countries reaching agreements to coexist peacefully and about the activities of the German church in striving for German unification. He said: After the recent implementation of church-related measures in the German Democratic Republic, the German people have gained new hope—the hope of successful consultations, the hope of a peaceful resolution to the German issue. We see actions that are truly conducive to peace.

    Pastor Niemöller concluded by calling on all Christians to strive for peace and peaceful coexistence.

    The next speaker was Pastor Førbeck of Norway, who said: Norway, along with Denmark, has joined the North Atlantic Treaty. However, opposition to this treaty is very widespread, and if the issue were put to a vote today, the majority of our people would certainly vote against it. At the same time, the establishment of foreign bases in Norway has also met with great opposition. Dependence on the United States has caused economic and financial difficulties for Norway. It is because of this that the Nordic countries are very concerned about the easing of international tensions. Førbeck emphasized that the world-scale peace movement, which represents the vast majority of the people, is of decisive importance in easing international tensions. Governments that satisfy the people's deep desire for peace, and those that help ease international tensions, should receive the gratitude of mankind. Now, the Soviet Union and many countries united with it have shown that they are extremely willing to reach an understanding with the West, and all good people are waiting with great interest for similar positive actions from Western countries.

    Førbeck pointed out that ordinary people must strengthen their relationships and friendships with each other. We must assure each other that each of us will call on our own compatriots to fight for peace and national independence. This will create a general public opinion that will force governments to pay attention to the people's demands for peace. Our task is to continue the struggle for peace and against war, and never relax our efforts just because the "Cold War" has eased somewhat.

    British representative James Figgins pointed out the increasingly sharp contradictions between the interests of the Commonwealth countries and all Sterling Bloc countries and the interests of the United States. He described China's position in international trade, and he demanded the lifting of restrictions on trade with China and the abolition of the U.S. Battle Act.

    Dechin Chimaung of Burma spoke about the issue of Kuomintang bandits invading Burma. He said that the Burmese people are determined to drive out the Kuomintang invaders. He emphasized that the U.S. government must be held responsible for the current situation. He explained the demands of the Burmese people, saying that the Kuomintang representatives should be expelled from the United Nations. The Burmese people hope for a ceasefire in Korea. The U.S. government should recognize the peaceful coexistence of two different social systems and conclude a peace treaty with the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, the United Kingdom, and France. Austrian representative Fischer pointed out in his speech that the United States is obstructing the conclusion of a peace treaty with Austria. The division of Germany and the revival of German imperialism in West Germany is a threat to Austria. There is only one way for Austria to get rid of the current burdens—to abandon the policy of war preparation, expand economic and political relations, and achieve a neutral and independent status. This is the goal of Austrian peace fighters.

    Han Xueye, the representative of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, said: The Korean people hope for an early realization of a ceasefire in Korea. The people of the world are looking forward to this matter. What made the U.S. side agree to resume the suspended armistice talks and sign the agreement on the issue of prisoners of war? The first reason for this is the proposal of our government and the government of the People's Republic of China, which once again showed the world that they are following a wise policy of peace, based on friendship between countries and aimed at peaceful cooperation between countries. The second reason is that neither the cruel battles nor the barbaric bombing can frustrate the heroic will of the Korean people. With the brotherly assistance of the Chinese People's Volunteers, the Korean people are defending their independence. The third reason is the tireless struggle of peace fighters around the world.

    Han Xueye continued, the entire Korean issue can only be resolved satisfactorily when foreign troops withdraw from Korea and the Korean people are given the opportunity to decide their own future. Our task and the task of all peace fighters is not only to strive for a ceasefire in Korea, but also to make this agreement a first step towards a comprehensive solution to international disputes and war.

    The Korean representative finally said: In order to consolidate and maintain peace, it is necessary to conclude a peace treaty among the five major powers, admit the legitimate representatives of the great Chinese people to the United Nations, and peacefully resolve the German issue and the Asian issues. In other words, it is necessary to resolve one by one all the outstanding issues that are aggravating the international situation and could become the fuse for a new world war. All these issues can be resolved through peaceful consultation.

    Australian Senator Morrow, representing the Australian Peace Committee, congratulated the conference. He talked about the policy of rearming Japan and the threat of the ANZUS treaty to Australia. This has made the Australian people deeply uneasy.

    Also speaking at the morning session were World Peace Council members Ivor Montagu (United Kingdom), Carlos Leon (Venezuela), and World Peace Council member Petros Kokkalis (Greece).

    世界和平理事会继续举行会议
    各国代表要求大国协商维护和平
    【新华社十七日讯】据塔斯社布达佩斯十七日讯：六月十六日，世界和平理事会继续举行会议，由达波赛担任主席。
    加拿大和平大会主席、世界和平理事会理事文幼章首先发言。他在演说中谈到了加拿大和平运动的任务，他指出这一运动的主要目的就是要促使五大国达成协议，宣布彼此互相决不作战。
    文幼章博士认为应该在全世界举行一次人民投票，向各国政府表明，人民要求举行导向和平的协商。
    文幼章提到邱吉尔、约克大主教及其他人的演说，也提到最近英联邦总理会议所通过的决议。他强调说，举行协商是必需的，也是可能的，这一点现在已毫无疑问了。消除战争威胁和消除使用武力的威胁是很重要的事。
    他指出，目前在各殖民地进行的战争威胁着和平。文幼章博士说，需要为非洲和其他殖民地人民争取得一个大宪章，使他们可以自由决定不让少数统治者享有特权。
    接着发言的是捷克斯洛伐克五金工人、世界和平理事会理事鲍契克。他说：捷克斯洛伐克人民真诚地期望和平，认为所有问题都可以通过协商解决。捷克斯洛伐克政府和人民一贯采取与所有国家保持和平友好的政策，我们认为德国问题可以根据波茨坦协定的原则来解决，按照严格遵守这个协定的苏联政府的建议，缔结对德和约。这个协定在西德没有得到遵守，在那里，重新军国主义化在进行，报复主义的情绪在复活，战争基地已建立起来。这是我们不能同意的。所有这些都危害了我们国家及德国所有邻国的安全。捷克斯洛伐克建议：整个德国要完全遵守波茨坦协定的原则。恢复缔结对德和约的谈判。宣布“一般性条约”和“欧洲防务集团”条约无效，这些条约是具有侵略性的条约。
    接着发言的是世界和平理事会理事、意大利的理卡多·龙巴迪，他谈到资本主义国家的经济情况和扩大世界贸易与缓和国际紧张局势的可能性。
    应世界和平理事会邀请参加会议的西德代表马丁·尼穆勒牧师在发言中谈到各国达成协议以和平共处的问题，并谈到了德国教会争取德国统一的活动。他说：在德意志民主共和国最近实施与教会有关的措施后，德国人已经获得新的希望——举行成功的协商的希望、和平解决德国问题的希望，我们看到了真正有利于和平的行动。
    尼穆勒牧师最后号召所有基督教徒为争取和平及和平共处而努力。
    接着发言的是挪威的福贝克牧师，他说：挪威与丹麦一道加入了北大西洋公约。但是对于这个公约的反对已经非常普遍，假如今天把这个问题交付表决的话，我国人民大多数必然会投票反对这个公约。同时，在挪威建立外国基地也遭到了极大的反对。对美国的依赖使挪威发生了经济和财政的困难。就是因为这样，所以北欧国家都非常关心国际紧张局势的缓和。福贝克强调指出，代表广大人民的世界规模的和平运动对于缓和国际紧张局势是有决定性的重要意义的。那些满足人民的深挚的和平愿望的政府，那些帮助国际紧张局势趋于缓和的政府是应该得到人类的感激的。现在，苏联和与它团结一致的许多国家已经表明它们极愿与西方获致谅解，所有的善良人们都怀着极大的兴趣在等待着西方国家同样的积极行动。
    福贝克指出，一般的人民必须加强他们彼此间的关系和友谊。我们必须互相保证，我们每个人都要唤起我们本国的同胞为和平与民族独立而斗争。这样就会造成一种普遍的舆论，将使各国政府不得不注意人民大众对和平的要求。我们的任务是继续进行争取和平、反对战争的斗争，决不因“冷战”已经比以前和缓就放松我们的努力。
    英国代表詹姆斯·费金斯发言指出了英联邦国家和所有英镑集团国家的利益与美国利益之间的日益尖锐的矛盾。他叙述了中国在国际贸易中的地位，他要求取消对于中国贸易的限制，并废除美国巴特尔法。
    缅甸代表德钦漆貌谈到国民党匪帮侵略缅甸的问题。他说，缅甸人民决心驱逐国民党侵略者。他着重指出，美国政府要对目前的形势负责。他说明缅甸人民的要求说，应该驱逐国民党代表出联合国。缅甸人民希望朝鲜停战。美国政府应该承认两种不同的社会制度和平共处，并和苏联、中华人民共和国、英国和法国缔结和平公约。奥地利代表费希尔在发言中指出，美国阻挠对奥和约的缔结。德国的分裂和德国帝国主义在西德的复活对奥地利是一个威胁。奥地利要摆脱目前的负担只有一个办法——放弃备战政策，扩大经济和政治关系，取得中立和独立的地位。这是奥地利和平战士们的目标。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代表韩雪野发言说：朝鲜人民希望早日实现朝鲜停战。全世界人民都期望着这件事情。使美国方面同意恢复中断了的停战谈判并签订战俘问题协议的是什么呢？使美方这样做的第一个原因是，我国政府和中华人民共和国政府的建议，这个建议再一次向全世界说明它们遵循着明智的和平政策，这种政策以各国之间友好为基础，以各国间彼此和平合作为目的。第二个原因
    是，不论是残酷的战斗，还是野蛮的轰炸都不能挫
    折朝鲜人民的英雄意志，在中国人民志愿军兄弟般
    的援助下，朝鲜人民正保卫他们的独立。第三个原因是，全世界和平战士的不倦的斗争。
    韩雪野继续说，只有外国军队撤出朝鲜，并给予朝鲜人民决定他们自己的前途的机会，整个朝鲜问题才能圆满解决。我们的任务和所有和平战士的任务不仅是要争取实现朝鲜停战，而且是要使这个协议成为走向全面解决国际分歧和战争的第一步。
    朝鲜代表最后说：为了巩固并维护和平，有必要缔结五大国和平公约，接纳伟大中国人民的合法代表参加联合国，和平解决德国问题和亚洲的问题。换句话说，有必要逐个地解决一切悬而未决的问题，这些问题使国际形势恶化，会成为引起新的大战的导火线。所有这些问题都能以和平协商方式得到解决。
    澳大利亚参议员莫罗代表澳大利亚和平委员会向大会表示祝贺。他谈到了重新武装日本政策和美澳新战争公约对澳大利亚的威胁。这已使得澳大利亚人民深为不安。
    在上午会议上发言的还有世界和平理事会理事艾弗·蒙塔古（英国）、卡洛斯·利恩（委内瑞拉）、世界和平理事会理事彼得罗斯·科卡利斯（希腊）。
