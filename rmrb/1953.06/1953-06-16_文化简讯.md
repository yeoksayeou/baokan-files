　　People's Literature Publishing House Publishes Works Commemorating Qu Yuan

　　To commemorate the 2230th anniversary of the passing of China’s great poet Qu Yuan, the People's Literature Publishing House has published five works: "Collected Annotations of Chu Ci," "Illustrations of Chu Ci," "Modern Translation of Qu Yuan's Fu," "Collected Works of Qu Yuan," and "Qu Yuan." These will be distributed by Beijing Xinhua Bookstore starting from the 15th.

　　"Collected Annotations of Chu Ci" was compiled and published by Zhu Xi in the second year of Duanping of the Song Lizong period (1235 AD), including eight volumes of "Chu Ci Collected Annotations," two volumes of "辩证" (辯證, Biànzhèng, Discernment), and six volumes of "Postscript." This is the oldest and most complete engraved edition of "Chu Ci" known today. It contains relatively accurate annotations and necessary textual research on all of Qu Yuan's works.

　　"Illustrations of Chu Ci" are paintings drawn by artists of past dynasties based on Qu Yuan's works. The content includes six kinds, totaling 210 paintings, including the "Nine Songs Illustration" traditionally attributed to Li Gonglin, Wen Zhengming's "Lord Xiang and Lady Xiang," Chen Hongshou's "Nine Songs Illustration," Xiao Yuncong's "Li Sao Illustration," and Men Yingzhao's "Supplementary Li Sao Illustration." The beginning of the volume also includes four portraits of Qu Yuan.

　　"Modern Translation of Qu Yuan's Fu" includes all twenty-five of Qu Yuan's works translated and annotated into vernacular Chinese by Guo Moruo, namely "Li Sao," "Nine Songs" (eleven poems), "Heavenly Questions," "Nine Chapters" (nine poems), "Summoning the Soul," "Divining a Home," and "The Fisherman."

　　"Collected Works of Qu Yuan" is annotated by Wen Huaisha, divided into two parts: the first half includes twenty-one poems, namely "Li Sao," "Nine Songs" (eleven poems), and "Nine Chapters" (nine poems); the second half includes five poems, namely "Heavenly Questions," "Summoning the Soul," "Distant Excursion," "Divining a Home," and "The Fisherman."

　　"Qu Yuan" is a five-act historical drama written by Guo Moruo in 1942. This play has been performed many times in China and has also been staged in the Soviet Union. This new version has been revised by the author multiple times.
