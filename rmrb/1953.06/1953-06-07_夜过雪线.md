    Night Crossing the Snow Line
    Xiang Benxi
    Winter in the Kangzang Plateau. Day and night, fierce winds whip up heavy snow, and everything is a vast expanse of white.
    It was here, one late night, that a convoy of vehicles, with the roar of their engines, cut through the wind and snow, heading straight for Que'er Mountain. To ensure the supply of materials for the road-building troops, they accepted an urgent mission: to cross the mountain range overnight and deliver the supplies to the Jinsha River.
    On both sides of the road, thick snowdrifts piled up more than a person high, leaving a path in the middle. The snow on the road was also a foot thick. The vehicles rolled through the snow, carving out two deep snow ruts. The muddy water and snowflakes in the ruts froze into hard ice blocks, which were smooth and slippery. At first, the assistant got out to lay down wooden blocks, and the driver applied the brakes on top of them. Although it was slow, they could barely move forward. Later, near the top of the mountain, as the slope increased, even with the wooden blocks and the brakes applied, the tires seemed to be covered in oil and kept sliding downwards. At this point, if the driver did not handle the steering wheel skillfully and steadily, the rear of the car would swerve, and there would be a risk of overturning.
    "Everyone quickly put on the anti-skid chains," platoon leader Tao Xiang shouted as he jumped out of the car.
    Clang, clang, clang! The drivers and co-drivers of each vehicle busied themselves, pulling and hanging the chains. Their hands were frozen stiff, and their feet were numb. The towel wrapped around their necks was as hard as a wooden frame. The snowflakes on the brims of their hats had frozen into icicles...
    "Ouch!" This was a scream from Xiao Hu.
    "What's wrong, Xiao Hu!" Zhang Yuancai quickly ran over.
    "It's nothing, it's nothing! Everyone, hurry up and put them on!"
    It turned out that nineteen-year-old Hu Xiaoxing's hands were freezing and stiff, but he didn't care at all. He grabbed the cold chain with force, and who knew that his hand would stick to the chain. He shook it hard, tearing off a large piece of skin, and fresh blood dripped down. The pain made him cry out, "Ouch!" When he heard his comrades' concerned inquiries, he immediately felt that he shouldn't have made such a fuss, so he wrapped a handkerchief around the wound and vigorously went back to work.
    The chains were installed, and the convoy's engines roared again, but the ice in the snow ruts was harder than stone. The iron chains pressed on it, only carving out white marks, and still slipping and sliding.
    What to do?
    "Platoon leader, I've got it, I've got it," Zhang Yuancai said excitedly, "Let's take the tattered tarpaulins, luggage rolls, everything, and spread them on the ground, and push to guarantee to get up there." When second platoon leader Tao Xiang heard that they were going to use everyone's luggage rolls as padding, he hesitated a little, as if asking for their opinions. He only heard: "Good idea, good idea, come on!" So some people got out of the car to unload luggage, and some spread it on the ground. In an instant, they covered a large section of the road. Some comrades even spread their own coats on the road.
    As the cars moved, people began to sing "Heave-ho" songs. Before long, the first car reached the ridge.
    Everyone was truly happy about it.
    Going back was downhill. Xiao Hu saw the bright and smooth road surface and became excited. He said with a smile, "Come on! Let's take a ride on the 'elevator'!" With that, he squatted down, stretched out his legs, and slid down, whoosh! So, everyone followed suit and slid down.
    Xiao Hu said proudly, "This thing is probably more exciting than the elevator in the Beijing Hotel!"
    "Hey! Old Wu! Write a letter and tell your wife, brag a little, that it's not easy to take the 'elevator' on Que'er Mountain!" Zhang Yuancai joked with Old Wu.
    "Ha... haha" A burst of happy laughter.
    After pushing the cars, everyone was covered in sweat, and the sweat on their faces melted the snowflakes, steaming with heat.
    The platoon leader said, "Comrades! To celebrate the victory, let's dance!"
    "Okay! Agreed!" With that, they supported each other and sang and danced to their hearts' content on Que'er Mountain, which was more than 5,000 meters above sea level at minus thirty degrees.
    The east turned white. Facing the dawn, the mighty convoy headed straight for the Jinsha River.

    夜过雪线
    项本习
    冬天的康藏高原。昼夜狂风卷着大雪，到处是白茫茫的一片。
    就在这里，一次深夜，随着马达的轰鸣，一队汽车披风破雪直奔雀儿山而来。为了保证筑路部队的物资供应，他们接受了紧急任务：连夜翻过岗去，把物资送到金沙江边。
    公路的两旁，积成了一人多高的厚厚雪墙，中间闪开一条道路，路上积雪也有尺把厚光景，车辆从积雪里滚过去，轧出两道深深的雪槽。雪槽里的泥水和雪花冻成硬梆梆的冰块，又光又滑。起先，助手下来铺三角木，驾驶员在上面拉煞车，走得虽慢，还可勉强前进；后来，快到山顶的地方，因山的坡度增大，就是垫上三角木，拉上煞车，轮胎也像沾上油一样，直往下滑，这时，驾驶员的方向盘要不掌握灵活稳当，汽车屁股一歪，就有覆车的危险。
    “大家赶快挂防滑链条。”排长陶祥一边跳下车来，一边发出了号令。
    哗哩哗啦！各车的正副司机忙碌起来，拉的拉，挂的挂。手冻僵了，脚冻麻木了，围在?子上的毛巾硬得像套着一个木框。帽沿上的雪花凝成了冰棱子……
    “哎呀！”这是小胡的一声尖叫。
    “怎么啦？小胡！”张元才赶快跑过去。
    “不怎的，不怎的！大家快挂呀！”
    原来十九岁的胡小兴，两手冻的发僵，他可全不在意，用劲一抓冰冷的链条，谁知手被链条黏住了，他用力一甩，拉掉了一大块肉皮，鲜血一滴滴往下流。他疼得不禁失声叫道：“哎呀！”当他听到伙伴们关切的询问时，立刻觉得自己不该大惊小怪，于是他把手帕往伤口上一包，又起劲地工作起来。
    链条挂好了，车队的马达又发出了一阵轰鸣，但雪槽里的冰结得比石头都硬，铁链条压在上面，只刻出一道道的白印子，还是?哧?哧地直打滑。
    怎么办？
    “排长有了，有了，”这是张元才兴奋的声音“咱们把破篷布、行李卷、一古脑都弄下来铺在地上，一推保管上去了。”二排长陶祥听到要拿大家的行李卷垫，还有点犹豫，好像征求意见似的向大家看。只听得：“好办法，好办法，快来吧！”于是大家就有的上车卸行李，有的在地下铺，一霎时就把一大节车道铺满了；有的同志连自己的大衣都铺在车道上。
    随着汽车的移动，人们开始唱起“拉号子”的歌声。不一会第一辆汽车就到达岭上了。
    大家真是乐得什么似的。
    往回走是下坡路，小胡看见明亮光滑的路面，兴头来了，笑着说：“来！咱们坐趟“电梯”吧！说着，他屁股往下一蹲，两腿一伸，哧溜！滑下去了。于是，大伙也跟着滑了下来。
    小胡得意地说：“这玩艺儿，恐怕比北京饭店的电梯还带劲哩！”
    “喂！老邬！写信告诉你的老婆，吹一下牛皮，雀儿山上坐‘电梯’，可不简单哪！”张元才开老邬的玩笑。
    “哈……哈哈”一阵快乐的閧笑。
    汽车推完了，大家都累得通身大汗，脸上的汗水溶着雪花一阵阵地冒着热气。
    排长说：“同志们！为了庆祝胜利，咱们来跳个舞吧！”
    “好！要得！”说着，他们就一个搀一个，在这零下三十多度拔海五千公尺的雀儿山上，尽情地歌舞起来。
    东方发白。迎着黎明，浩浩荡荡的车队直奔金沙江而去。
