    On the Battlefront of National Economic Construction
    First Phase of the Fozi Ridge Reservoir Project Completed
    The first phase of the Fozi Ridge Reservoir project on the Huai River has been completed, and the earth dam built to facilitate the second phase of construction has also been successfully closed. The construction of the Fozi Ridge Reservoir is basically divided into two phases: the first phase involves constructing the western half of the multiple-arch dam on the west bank of the Pi River; the second phase involves constructing the eastern half of the multiple-arch dam on the east bank of the Pi River, and continuing the unfinished work on the western half. Since construction began last year, large-scale foundation clearing and grouting work (injecting cement slurry into the rock crevices) have been carried out at the western half of the multiple-arch dam site, and the dam body made of concrete has been poured on the solid rock. As of mid-May, the Fozi Ridge Reservoir project had poured 60,000 cubic meters of concrete, accounting for approximately 29% of the total task; grouted more than 5,300 meters, accounting for approximately 30% of the total task; completed 720,000 cubic meters of earthwork, accounting for approximately 60% of the total task; and completed 500,000 cubic meters of stonework, accounting for approximately 95% of the total task. In addition, five of the eleven sluice gates on the multiple-arch dam have been installed. The design work for the Fozi Ridge Reservoir hydroelectric power station has also been completed. The western half of the project is currently continuing to pour concrete, and foundation clearing on the eastern half of the dam site is about to begin.
    The multiple-arch dam of the Fozi Ridge Reservoir is the first high dam built with reinforced concrete in New China. The achievements made in the first phase of the reservoir project are a manifestation of the rapid progress of our country's water conservancy construction. (According to Xinhua News Agency)
    Reconstruction Project of State-owned Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Plant Under Full-Scale Construction
    The reconstruction project of the state-owned Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Plant in Anhui Province began full-scale construction on May 27. Three months ago, this was a ruined iron and steel plant abandoned for nine years and severely damaged; now, more than 1,000 workers are working hard to revive this iron and steel plant, which will have twice the original output. The foundation work for the hot blast stove began pile driving on May 29; workers in mechanical, electrical, civil engineering, and hoisting and transportation trades have also started intensive parallel operations. Workers from the Taiyuan engineering team, who are riveting four hot blast stoves, had installed the four hot blast stoves to the eighth layer by May 3. Workers in the hoisting and transportation team and riveters in the mechanical team dismantled two dilapidated blast furnaces two days ahead of schedule at the end of May. Due to the workers' active efforts to improve operations, the hoisting workers saved 99 workdays compared to the original estimate, and the riveters completed the plan with less than half the manpower.
    Currently, all engineering teams have begun to convey and discuss the overall project schedule, and are preparing to further mobilize workers to schedule specific construction plans for each trade. (According to Xinhua News Agency)
    Yumen Oilfield Actively Implements Soviet Experts' Suggestions, Drilling Speed and Oil Production Increased in May
    Soviet experts arrived at the Yumen Oilfield in early May, first visiting various plants and teams, and then participating in a work inspection meeting held by the Mining Bureau for the Drilling Department and the Oil Production Plant. At the meeting, based on the suggestions of the Soviet experts, the monthly plans for the Drilling Department and the Oil Production Plant for May were revised: the drilling footage plan for the Drilling Department was increased by 31% compared to the original plan; the crude oil production volume of the Oil Production Plant was increased by 92%. Afterwards, the experts personally went to the site to understand the geological and drilling work situation, and put forward many valuable suggestions.
    As a result of actively implementing the suggestions of Soviet experts, new atmospheres have emerged in various plants and teams, and labor productivity has been greatly improved. According to the experts' suggestions, comrades from a certain well used double pumps and drill bits suitable for the current formation during drilling, and the average drilling speed increased by 1.48 times in the same formation; after the No. 1 oil separation station of the Oil Production Plant implemented the suggestion of universal well opening and increasing the oil nozzle, the daily output increased to nearly five times. As of the end of May, the Drilling Department completed the May drilling plan three days ahead of schedule, exceeding the April plan by more than double; the Oil Production Plant also overfulfilled the May production plan.

    Shaoyang Sulfuric Acid Plant in Hunan Successfully Trials Coal Pyrite Ore to Produce Sulfuric Acid
    The raw materials used by the local state-owned Shaoyang Sulfuric Acid Plant in Hunan to manufacture sulfuric acid were previously pure sulfur extracted by indigenous methods. Therefore, the extraction efficiency was low, labor-intensive, and the price was very expensive. For three years, there were few profits turned over to the state. After the nationwide planned economic construction began, in order to support basic construction, the factory's employees proposed using coal pyrite ore to manufacture sulfuric acid in a rationalization proposal. After overcoming various difficulties, this sulfuric acid was finally successfully tested, which solved a major problem in production. The quality of sulfuric acid manufactured with coal pyrite ore is excellent, the raw material cost is reduced by half, and more than 100 million yuan can be saved for the country every month.
    Tokyo Bay Fishing Grounds are Rapidly Recovering and Developing
    China's famous fish producing area, Tokyo Bay fishing grounds, is rapidly recovering and developing. In the first year after liberation—1951, Tokyo Bay fishing grounds had a bumper fish harvest unprecedented in 25 years, with a fish production of approximately 15,660 tons. In 1952, fish production soared to 32,912 tons. This year, the fishermen of Tokyo Bay have set a fishing plan to increase production by 10% compared to last year. Currently, fishermen are actively building fishing boats and replenishing fishing nets and other tools to welcome the big fishing season that begins in late September.

    Large Yellow Croaker Bumper Harvest in the Waters of the Zhoushan Islands
    The large yellow croaker season in the waters of the Zhoushan Islands in Zhejiang Province is at its second peak. More than 45,000 organized fishermen from more than a dozen coastal counties in Taizhou, Wenzhou, Zhoushan, Ningbo and other regions are driving more than 10,000 fishing boats to catch them intensively.
    Now, the fish schools are gradually moving north, and the center of the fishing grounds has shifted from Maotou Yang and Da’mu Yang in the southern seas to Daiqu Yang in the northern seas. The first batch of large yellow croaker fishing season in Maotou Yang, Da’mu Yang, and Daiqu Yang this year has come to an end. More than 380,000 dan of fresh fish were caught in the seven days from May 9 to 15. Among them, Maotou and Da’mu Yang produced more than 300,000 dan, greatly exceeding the harvest of the first season at the beginning of last year. Maotou Yang only produced 150,000 dan in the entire season last year, and the first batch alone this year produced more than 180,000 dan. The high catches of fishing boats reached 140 dan to more than 200 dan per pair (two boats) per day. This is another large yellow croaker bumper harvest after the small yellow croaker bumper harvest in the Zhoushan coastal area, which has not been seen for several years.

    在祖国经济建设的战线上
    佛子岭水库第一期工程告一段落
    淮河佛子岭水库第一期工程告一段落，为便于第二期工程施工而建筑的土围坝也已胜利合龙。佛子岭水库的施工程序基本分为两期：第一期在淠河西岸建筑连拱坝西半边工程；第二期在淠河东岸建筑连拱坝的东半边工程，并继续进行西半边未完工程。从去年开始施工后，连拱坝西半边坝址已进行了大规模的清理基础工作和灌浆工作（在岩石的缝隙中灌进水泥浆），并在坚固的岩石上浇筑混凝土的坝身。到五月中旬为止，佛子岭水库工程已浇筑混凝土六万立方公尺，约占总任务百分之二十九；灌浆五千三百多公尺，约占总任务百分之三十；完成土工七十二万公方，约占总任务百分之六十；完成石工五十万公方，约占总任务百分之九十五。另外，连拱坝上的十一道闸门已有五道闸门装好。佛子岭水库水力发电站的设计工作也已完成。西半边的工程目前继续浇筑混凝土，东半边坝址即将开始清理基础。
    佛子岭水库的连拱坝，是新中国第一座用钢筋混凝土建筑的最高的水坝。水库第一期工程所得到的成就，是我国水利建设事业突飞猛进的表现。（据新华社讯）
    国营马鞍山炼铁厂的重建工程全面施工
    安徽省国营马鞍山炼铁厂的重建工程，已在五月二十七日全面施工。三个月前，这里是一座停工九年毁坏严重的炼铁厂废墟；现在，一千多工人正在为复活这个比原来产量提高两倍的炼铁厂进行着紧张的劳动。修筑热风炉的基础工程，从五月二十九日就开始了打桩工作；机械、电气、土木建筑和起重运输等工种的工人，也都开始了紧张的平行作业。正在铆造四座热风炉的太原工程队的工人，到五月三日已把四座热风炉装到第八层。起重运输队的起重工和机械队的铆工，在五月底提前两天拆完了两座破旧高炉。由于工人们积极想办法改进操作，起重工比原估工数节省了九十九工，铆工也只花了不到一半的人工就完成了计划。
    目前，各工程队已开始传达和讨论全部工程进度计划，并准备进一步发动工人排定各个工种的具体施工表。（据新华社讯）
    玉门油矿积极执行苏联专家建议五月份钻进速度和采油量都提高
    苏联专家五月初到达玉门油矿，首先参观了各厂、队，接着又参加了矿务局召开的钻井处和采油厂工作检查会议。在会上，根据苏联专家建议，修订了钻井处和采油厂五月份的月度计划：钻井处进尺计划比原计划增加了百分之三十一；采油厂原油生产量增加百分之九十二。以后，专家们亲自到现场了解了地质和钻井工作的情况，提出了许多宝贵的建议。
    积极执行苏联专家建议的结果，各厂队都出现了新的气象，劳动生产率已大大提高。某号井的同志们根据专家的建议，钻井时开双泵并使用了适合于目前地层的钻头，在同样地层，平均钻进速度提高了一点四八倍；采油厂一号选油站执行了普遍开井、加大油嘴的建议后，每日产量增加到将近五倍。截至五月底，钻井处提前三天完成五月份钻进计划，超过四月份计划一倍以上；采油厂也超额完成了五月份的生产计划。（孙雁）
    湖南邵阳硫酸厂试用煤磺矿石制造硫酸成功
    湖南地方国营邵阳硫酸厂以前制造硫酸的原料，是用土法提炼出来的纯硫磺，因此提炼效率低，费人工，价格很贵，三年来很少有利润上缴。全国有计划的经济建设开始后，该厂职工为了支援基本建设，在合理化建议中，提出用煤磺矿石制造硫酸，克服了各种困难后，这种硫酸终于试验成功，这就解决了生产上的很大问题。用煤磺矿石制造的硫酸品质十分优良，原料成本降低了一半，每月可替国家节约一亿元以上。
    东京湾渔场正在迅速恢复发展
    我国著名鱼产区东京湾渔场，正在迅速恢复发展。解放后第一年——一九五一年，东京湾渔场鱼产丰收为二十五年来所未有，产鱼量约在一万五千六百六十吨。一九五二年，产鱼量激增到三万二千九百十二吨。今年东京湾渔民又订出了比去年增产一成的捕鱼计划。目前渔民们正积极修建渔船，添补渔网等工具，迎接九月下旬开始的大渔汛期。（据新华社讯）
    舟山群岛洋面大黄鱼丰收
    浙江省舟山群岛洋面各渔场大黄鱼汛正值第二水旺汛，台州、温州、舟山、宁波等专区沿海十多个县的四万五千多有组织的渔民，正驾着一万多条渔船紧张捕捉。
    现在，鱼群逐渐北移，渔场中心已由南洋的猫头洋、大目洋转入北洋的岱衢洋。猫头洋、大目洋、岱衢洋今年第一水大黄鱼初汛已告结束，从五月九日到十五日的七天中即捕获鲜鱼三十八万多担。其中猫头、大目两洋即产三十万担多，大大超过去年初汛的收获。猫头洋去年全汛仅产十五万担，今年第一水即产十八万担以上。渔船捕获量高的，每对
    （两条）一天达一百四十担到二百多担。这是继舟山沿海小黄鱼丰收以后又一次几年未有的大黄鱼大丰收。（据新华社讯）
