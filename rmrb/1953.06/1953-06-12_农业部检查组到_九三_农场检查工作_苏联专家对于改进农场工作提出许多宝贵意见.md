The Ministry of Agriculture's inspection team, organized by the Central People's Government's Ministry of Agriculture, conducted thorough inspections of various departments, operational areas, and production teams at the state-owned "Jiusan" mechanized farm during the spring plowing season. Comrade Balykin, General Advisor of the Central People's Government's Ministry of Agriculture and Soviet agricultural expert, and machine expert Comrade Legigein also participated in the inspection. The Soviet experts presented inspection reports to all cadres at the farm. Both experts offered many concrete suggestions regarding business management and machine work. Soviet expert Legigein, upon seeing uncovered oil drums carelessly left in the open at the Fourth Production Team of the First Operational Area, patiently explained that oil mixed with sand would increase wear and tear on the parts.

Throughout the inspection process, Balykin and Legigein demonstrated a clear commitment to relying on the workers to run the farm well. Every time they arrived at an operational area, they would delve into the production teams and fields to understand the tractor drivers' work and living conditions, and discuss methods for improving work on the spot. They especially valued the farm's cultivation of its employees and the democratic life within the farm, repeatedly asking the tractor drivers: "During production, do the farm manager and other leading cadres often come here? Do they discuss the progress of production with you and offer assistance?" While inspecting the livestock farm, Balykin asked a comrade in charge of the livestock farm why they weren't breeding horses. The reply was: "The bureau didn't assign us the task, and we can't do anything even if we want to breed them." Balykin said, "As long as your opinion is correct, you should realize it through superiors and newspapers." The experts attached great importance to the timely exchange of experiences between operational areas and between teams.

The experts called on the workers not to surrender to difficulties, to fight against nature, and to use scientific methods to solve technical difficulties. Some comrades at the farm emphasized that the rainy season would cause losses to the wheat harvest. Balykin said: The only way to avoid losses from the rainy season is to shorten the growing season. Vernalization of seeds and sunning seeds can cause seeds to emerge earlier and crops to mature earlier. Therefore, this agricultural technique should be widely implemented on the farm. Comrades at the livestock farm pointed out that the soil and water here are deficient in iodine, and sheep are prone to foot rot, resulting in a high mortality rate. Balykin believed that regional diseases of livestock can be overcome by improving feed and will not affect the development of sheep flocks here.

Balykin and Legigein paid close attention to the relationship between the farm and the surrounding peasants and the farm's demonstration effect on the peasants. The inspection team took time out of their busy schedule to visit the newly established collective farm, Xinsheng, near the farm.

Zhang Kaining, a cadre from the People's Supervision Office of the Central People's Government's Ministry of Agriculture, at a cadre meeting, criticized "Jiusan" Farm's lack of sound systems for the safekeeping of machinery, the serious phenomenon of dismantling machinery, as well as substandard plowing quality and excessively low wheat germination rates causing waste. He suggested that the farm launch an in-depth inspection and discussion of the above-mentioned serious phenomena among all employees. He also suggested that the farm report the results of the inspection to the Central People's Government's Ministry of Agriculture. Zhang Kaining also suggested that the farm promptly establish a people's supervision group within the farm to promptly absorb the opinions of the masses of employees throughout the farm and better improve their work. After this inspection, all employees of the farm further clarified their future goals and directions for improving their work.

    农业部检查组到“九三”农场检查工作
    苏联专家对于改进农场工作提出许多宝贵意见
    中央人民政府农业部所组织的国营农场检查组，在春耕期间，曾深入到国营“九三”机械农场的各部门、各作业区、各生产队检查工作。中央人民政府农业部总顾问苏联农业专家巴列金和机务专家列吉庚也参加了这次检查。苏联专家向全场干部作了检查报告。在经营管理方面、机务工作方面，两位专家都提出了许多具体的意见。苏联专家列吉庚在第一作业区第四生产队看见机油桶没有盖子，随便放在露天地里，便耐心地告诉大家：搀着沙子的机油会增加零件的磨损。
    在检查工作的过程中，巴列金和列吉庚体现出明确的依靠职工办好农场的思想。他们每到一个作业区，都要深入生产队、田间了解拖拉机驾驶员的作业和生活情况，并就地商谈改善工作的方法。他们尤其重视场方对职工的培养和场内的民主生活，不止一次地询问拖拉机驾驶员们：“在进行生产中，场长和其他领导干部常到你们这里来吗？跟你们在一起谈生产工作进行的情况并给你们帮助吗？”在畜牧场检查工作的时候，巴列金问畜牧场的一位负责同志为什么不繁殖马，回答说：“局里没给任务，我们想繁殖也无能为力。”巴列金说：“只要你们的意见是正确的，你们就应通过上级和报纸使它实现。”专家极重视作业区与作业区之间、队与队之间及时地交流经验。
    专家们号召职工不要向困难投降，要向自然作斗争，要用科学的方法解决技术上的困难。场里有的同志强调这里的雨季要给麦收造成损失。巴列金说：避免雨季损失只有缩短生长期。种子春化及晒种可以使种籽提早出苗，作物提前成熟，因此，在农场中应当广泛地实行这个农业技术。畜牧场的同志提出这里的水土缺碘质，羊容易生烂蹄病，因而死亡率很高。巴列金认为牲畜地区性的病，可以用改良饲料的办法来克服，并不影响这里发展羊群。
    巴列金和列吉庚很注意农场与周围农民的关系，农场对农民的示范作用；检查小组在百忙中抽空到农场附近的新生集体农庄进行了访问。
    中央人民政府农业部人民监察室干部张开宁在干部大会上，对于“九三”农场在机械保管方面缺乏健全的制度和拆卸机械的严重现象，以及翻地质量不合规格和小麦发芽率过低造成浪费的现象，一一提出批评；他建议场方发动全场职工，对上述严重现象进行深入检查与讨论；并将检查的结果汇报中央人民政府农业部。张开宁并建议场方迅速在场内成立人民监察组，以便及时地吸取全场职工群众的意见，更好地改进工作。经过这次检查，全场职工更进一步明确认识了今后的奋斗目标及改进工作的方向。    （文戎、童代澍）
