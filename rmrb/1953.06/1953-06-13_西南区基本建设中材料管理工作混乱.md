Title: Chaotic Materials Management in Basic Construction in the Southwest Region

The materials allocation and procurement work in basic construction in the Southwest region is extremely chaotic, resulting in serious waste. Many units do not conduct serious investigation and research, and do not implement the policy of using local materials, blindly allocating and purchasing various materials and equipment. The Chongqing 507 Factory's project needed cobblestones. There are a large number of cobblestones on the riverside near the factory. The factory did not use local materials, but transported limestone with poorer quality than cobblestones from hundreds of miles away. The sand needed for the project was not taken from the riverside, but transported from Jianyang, hundreds of miles away. The bricks used by the 610 Factory and the Chongqing Xiaolongkan construction site were not directly transported via the Jialing River, but were transshipped via the Yangtze River, requiring an additional 3 million yuan in transshipment fees per 10,000 bricks. The phenomenon of materials needed for basic construction near the Yangtze River being transported to the Jialing River basin for allocation is even more common. This chaotic allocation and purchase has resulted in the freight of building materials in the Chongqing area accounting for a very large proportion of the cost.

In addition, some equipment and devices can be bought in the Southwest or domestically, but because there is no in-depth investigation and there is a lack of contact between equipment management departments and user departments, blind ordering from outside the region or from foreign countries occurs. Ordering from outside the region and from foreign countries is also uncertain, causing the project to be delayed for a long time. The Southwest Coal Mine Administration urgently needed a large number of galvanized iron pipes in its basic construction, and searched for a long time in foreign countries and other domestic regions, before finally buying them in Shanghai. However, the equipment company near the bureau had a large stock, and the price was 39 percent lower than in Shanghai. The Southwest Geological Bureau found equipment it could not buy abroad in its own warehouse.

The waste in material supply work is also manifested in the fact that material supply plans do not have accurate basis, but are based on estimates, resulting in blind purchases and a large amount of backlog. The 507 Factory project allocated 3,000 tons of cement in the first quarter, but only used 650 tons. After the completion of the Southwest Postal and Telecommunications School project, the Chongqing Xiaolongkan construction site and the 497 Factory project, it was discovered that a total of 100,000 extra bricks and tiles, and 140,000 catties of river sand were purchased. Some of these materials were transferred out after spending a large amount of freight, some were backlogged, and some were completely scrapped. The Southwest Construction Engineering Bureau's directly affiliated units have not yet finished dealing with the stagnant materials from the past, and according to incomplete statistics, the recent stagnant materials have reached more than 8 billion yuan.

In addition, failure to allocate or purchase in strict accordance with the required specifications of the project has also caused a lot of waste. The timber purchased and allocated by the Materials Supply Department of the Southwest Construction Engineering Bureau in the Leshan area of Chengdu did not meet the specifications. After being allocated to various engineering offices, some could not be used, some had to be returned back and forth, and some had to be processed separately, or large materials were used for small purposes and good materials were used for inferior purposes.

The material management work on the construction site is even more chaotic. Some materials are used but not claimed, or claimed but not used; some have materials but no accounts, or have accounts but no materials; some return materials without claiming them. Many construction sites do not have a material receipt and issuance system at all. As soon as the materials arrived at the 201 construction site of the Southwest Construction Engineering Bureau, everyone took them at will. Four projects on the construction site are about to be completed, but the material accounts have not been touched. Although some construction sites have established a material requisition system, it is only in name. The material names, specifications, and unit prices are not uniform, the material requisition has no standards, the project names are filled in randomly, and the materials are misappropriated from each other. The 507 Factory construction site accounted for 400 bamboo poles issued, but 660 poles were returned. The 46th project of the First Engineering Office of the Southwest Construction Engineering Bureau did not receive asbestos tiles at all when making the foundation, but returned dozens of various asbestos tiles. The chaotic material management work will also give a few bad elements the opportunity to steal state assets.

The above situation should be paid attention to and corrected by the relevant basic construction departments in the Southwest.

### 西南区基本建设中材料管理工作混乱

    西南区基本建设中材料管理工作混乱
    西南区基本建设中的材料调拨和采购工作极其混乱，造成严重的浪费现象。许多单位不认真调查研究，没有贯彻就地取材的方针，盲目调拨和采购各种材料与设备。重庆五零七厂的工程要用鹅卵石，该厂附近的江边就有大量鹅卵石，该厂不就地取材却从百里以外调运比鹅卵石质量差的石灰石，工程需用的砂子也不从江边就地取用，而从数百里以外的简阳运来。六一零厂和重庆小龙坎工地用的砖不经嘉陵江直接调运，而经长江转运，每万匹砖需多用转运费三百万元。长江附近基本建设需用的材料到嘉陵江沿岸去调运的现象更是普遍。这种乱调、乱购的结果，使目前重庆区建筑材料运费在成本中占了极大的比重。此外，有些器材设备本来在西南或国内就可以买到，但因为没有深入调查，器材经营部门和需用部门也缺乏联系，所以造成盲目地向区外或国外订货的现象，而区外与国外订货又无把握，工程因之长期拖延。西南煤矿管理局基本建设中急需大批白铁管，先后在国外和国内其他地区找了很长时间，最后才在上海买到。可是该局附近的器材公司存货很多，而且价格还比上海低廉百分之三十九。西南地质局在国外没有买到的器材，却在自己的仓库里找到了。材料供应工作的浪费还表现在材料供应计划没有精确依据，只凭估计，就盲目购买，造成大量积压。五零七厂工程第一季度调拨了三千吨水泥，实际只用了六百五十吨。西南邮电学校工程，重庆小龙坎工地和四九七厂工程，完工后发现共多购买了砖瓦十万匹，河沙十四万斤等，这些材料有的花了一大笔运费才转运出去，有的只得积压，有的完全报废了。西南建筑工程局直属各单位过去的呆滞材料还没有处理完毕，最近的呆滞材料据不完全统计又达八十亿元以上。此外，由于不认真按照工程需要规格调拨或采购，也造成许多浪费。西南建筑工程局材料供应处在成都乐山一带采购、调拨的木材，都不合规格，拨给各工程处后，有的不能用，有的要往返退换，有的需另行加工，或者就大材小用、优材劣用。
    工地的材料管理工作更乱。有的是用而未领或领而未用；有的是有料无账，或有账无料；有的没有领料就跑来退料。许多工地根本没有材料收发制度。西南建筑工程局二零一工地材料一到，大家就随便取用，该工地四个工程即将完工，但材料账却原封未动。有些工地虽建立了领料制度，但是有名无实，材料名称、规格单价都不统一，领料漫无标准，对工程名称乱填，材料互相挪用。五零七厂工地账上发出楠竹四百根，退料却有六百六十根，西南建筑工程局第一工程处第四十六号工程在做基脚时根本没有领过石棉瓦，却退回各种石棉瓦几十张。材料管理工作的混乱并会给少数坏分子以盗窃国家资财的空隙。
    以上情况，西南有关基本建设部门应引起注意并加以纠正。
