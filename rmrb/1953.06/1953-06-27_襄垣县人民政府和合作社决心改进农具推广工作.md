    Xiangyuan County People's Government and Cooperatives Determined to Improve Farm Implement Promotion Work

    Letter from the Xiangyuan County People's Government, Xiangyuan County Cooperative Union, Shanxi: The "Reader's Letters in Brief" column on April 26th published a letter from Lian Muwang and Lian Zengyun, farmers of Huanglou North Village in our county, reflecting shortcomings in our county's work last year in promoting new-style walking plows, waterwheels, and pesticides. This reflection is consistent with the facts. In the drought prevention and resistance work in 1952, we did indeed make the mistake of using purely administrative orders to carry out the work; the installation of waterwheels in Huanglou North Village is one such fact. At that time, the village cadres and the masses did not understand why they should install waterwheels in their minds. Zhao Fuquan, the district civil affairs assistant, without asking about the specific conditions, allowed seven households in Huanglou North Village and the Zhaozhuang-affiliated Simugou Village to jointly purchase a waterwheel and install it in the Yinshui ditch. As a result, the flat land was very wet and did not need water, the slope was uneven and could not be irrigated, and the water source was insufficient. After the installation, not even one mu was irrigated.

    In terms of the promotion of walking plows, the purchase and use of walking plows by the masses was not entirely voluntary. The village purchased eight walking plows one after another, and more than 30 people studied the use of the technology in the county and district. However, because the county and district cadres did not fully master the technology either, and the instruction was not thorough enough, only five people in the village had a good grasp of the technology of using walking plows after studying, and generally mastered the depth adjustment. Therefore, each walking plow only tilled an average of 42 mu of land in the summer and autumn seasons. However, last autumn, some members of Ma Genwang's group could not take turns to use the new-style walking plow for tilling, and raised some opinions, which shows that not all the masses were against using walking plows, but that many farmers did not know how to use them and some of the masses were not accustomed to using them. As for carrying both new and old plows to the fields, that is indeed the case. According to the masses: on the one hand, they were prepared to use the old plow when the new plow was not easy to use, and on the other hand, they had to use the old plow to till the sloping corners at the end.

    There was a phenomenon of assigning quotas in the promotion of pesticides. Last year, the village first purchased nine jin of copper sulfate and one jin and twelve liang of red alum, which were distributed to each group according to the amount of land in the mutual aid group; these two kinds of pesticides were completely used up. However, in order to complete the sales task, the cooperative sold one jin and eight liang of cotton aphid soap and one jin and six liang of DDT to the village, regardless of whether the masses needed them. Because the village had no sprayers and no cotton aphids had occurred, these two kinds of pesticides are still stored in the group leader's home.

    The reader's reflection that we will still assign the village the task of "promoting" walking plows and pesticides this year is a concern caused by our past coercive command style in the masses; in fact, our county has not assigned such tasks to the villages this year.

    The coercive command style in our county's past promotion of production materials is inseparable from the bureaucracy of the leadership. We lacked policy education and specific guidance for the cadres, resulting in turning good things into bad things and causing dissatisfaction among the masses. We have organized cadres to go deep into the villages for a general inspection. Waterwheels, walking plows, and pesticides that were not truly voluntarily purchased by the masses and that are indeed unusable will be properly disposed of. Among them, the waterwheel in Huanglou North Village has been decided to be transferred to other villages in need. As some of the masses in the village have begun to enjoy using the purchased walking plows, we will further strengthen technical guidance and help the masses use them, so as to gradually give play to their effectiveness.

### 襄垣县人民政府和合作社决心改进农具推广工作

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    襄垣县人民政府和合作社决心改进农具推广工作
    山西襄垣县人民政府、襄垣县合作社联合社来信：四月二十六日“读者来信摘要”栏刊登我县黄楼北村农民连木旺、连曾云来信，反映我县去年推广新式步犁、水车、药剂工作中的缺点。这一反映是合乎事实的。一九五二年防旱抗旱工作中，我们确实有单纯用行政命令手段进行工作的错误；黄楼北村安装水车就是事实之一。当时该村村干部和群众对为什么要安水车思想上搞不通，区民政助理员赵富全不问具体条件如何，就让黄楼北村七户和赵庄属四亩沟村伙买水车一部，安在阴水沟地。结果，平地很湿不用水，坡地不平不能浇，水源又不足，安起后一亩也没浇过。
    在步犁推广工作方面，群众购用步犁不是完全自愿的。该村先后购买了步犁八张，同时先后有三十余人分别在县区学习使用技术。但由于县区干部对技术也没有完全掌握，传授不够透彻，结果学习后该村只有五个人使用步犁的技术较好，一般能掌握了深浅调度。因此，夏秋两季每张步犁平均只耕地四十二亩。可是，去年秋季马根旺组有些组员轮不到用新式步犁耕地，曾提出意见，这说明并不是全部群众反对用步犁，而是有不少农民不会使用和部分群众还不习惯使用。至于扛新旧两张犁上地确是事实。据群众说：这一方面是准备在新犁不好用时用旧犁耕，另一方面是最后要用旧犁耕斜角部分。
    在药剂推销工作上是有摊派现象的。该村在去年先购买王铜九斤、红矾一斤十二两，按互助组土地多少分配各组；这两种药剂完全用了。但合作社为了完成推销任务，不问群众是否需要，又推销给该村棉蚜皂一斤八两、滴滴涕一斤六两。因为该村既无喷雾器又未发生棉蚜，这两种药至今还在组长家里放着。
    读者反映我们今年还要分配该村“推广”步犁、农药的任务，这是过去我们强迫命令作风在群众中引起的顾虑；实际上今年我县并没有分配各村这种任务。
    我县过去推销生产资料工作中的强迫命令作风是与领导方面的官僚主义分不开的。我们对干部缺乏政策教育和具体指导，结果把好事办成坏事，引起群众的不满。我们已组织干部深入各村普遍检查。不是群众真正自愿购置的水车、步犁、药剂，而且确实无条件使用的，都进行适当的处理。其中黄楼北村的水车决定调剂给其它需用的村子。该村所买步犁，因部分群众已开始乐于使用，今后我们将进一步加强技术指导，帮助群众使用，逐渐发挥其效能。
