    Handicraft Production Should Be Valued

    Editor's Note: The following selected three letters reflect two erroneous attitudes of some units towards handicraft production: One is blind development without considering needs and possibilities, leading to oversupply. When things become unmanageable, they adopt a nihilistic attitude and simply abandon it. The approach of the Shashi Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company to the hand-woven fabric industry falls into this category. The other erroneous attitude is the abandonment of necessary support and care for handicraft production that is possible and needed for development, resulting in the near closure of handicraft production needed by farmers, affecting the supply to the broad masses of people. The gradual reduction of handicraft households in Mingshui County, Heilongjiang, is an example of this. We hope these readers' letters will attract attention from various regions, strengthen leadership over handicrafts, and earnestly examine and resolve the current problems in handicraft production to unleash the productive enthusiasm of handicraftsmen.

    Hubei Shashi Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company Should Examine
    Its Erroneous Practices in Dealing with the Hand-Woven Fabric Industry

    Letters from Hu Songze and Zhao Zuyi of the Shashi Handicraft Weaving Production Cooperative, Hubei: In September 1951, Shashi had more than 200 hand looms. These weaving households mostly produced and sold their own products, and business was very good. In early 1952, the Shashi Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company and the Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce blindly called on other industries to universally switch to the weaving industry and forced the original weaving households to process exclusively for the company, forbidding them from selling on their own, otherwise, they would not be sold cotton yarn. Under such circumstances, the number of looms in the city increased to over 1,000 for a time, resulting in an oversupply. At the same time, the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company did not provide practical guidance and supervision to the processing households, and did not pay attention to quality when receiving goods, resulting in an accumulation of more than 40,000 bolts of various colored fabrics, worth more than 7.6 billion yuan in cash. It is estimated that these fabrics will not be sold out within a year. Under such circumstances, the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company asked us to "produce and sell on our own," abandoning us. However, they raised the yarn price by 30,000 yuan per small bundle compared to the processing price, forcing many looms to stop production, seriously affecting the lives of workers.

    We believe that the Shashi Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company's practice of blindly developing the hand-woven fabric industry beforehand and sitting idly by while it collapses afterward is wrong.

    Why are there Fewer and Fewer Handicraft Households in Mingshui County, Heilongjiang?

    Letter from reader Wang Zhenhua: After reading the People's Daily editorial on April 23, "Handicraft Production Must Be Valued," I was reminded of some situations and problems in Mingshui County, Heilongjiang Province, where the number of handicraft households is gradually decreasing. According to statistics in January 1952, there were 189 handicraft households in the county, but by December of the same year, there were only 125 left. Currently, the number of handicraft households in the county is still decreasing. The decrease in the number of handicraft households is partly due to products not suitable for people's needs or oversupply, but some should not have closed down but did. For example, the blacksmith shops that made sickles and hoes numbered 25 in the county the year before last, but by the end of last year, there were only nine left, and five of them were about to close down. The main reason for the decrease in blacksmith shops is the inability to buy raw materials. The scrap iron from farmers' homes is all purchased by the cooperatives in each township and supplied to the production cooperatives for use, not sold to private households; and the industrial and commercial departments do not help them solve the raw material problem, allowing them to go to Harbin and other places to purchase on their own, but they often return empty-handed and cannot produce. For example, there were two plowshare (agricultural tool) furnaces in the county. One was under the leadership of the county cooperative and formed a plowshare furnace production cooperative, and the raw materials were supplied by the township cooperatives through the unified purchase of scrap iron. The other private plowshare furnace has been closed down because it cannot buy raw materials. In fact, the iron purchased by the cooperative is not used up; and the plowshares produced by the production cooperative cannot meet the needs of the farmers. It is estimated that the county needs to replenish 6,000 plowshares every year, while the plowshare production cooperative can only supply 4,000.

    I believe that the situation in Mingshui County, where some handicraft industries that need and can be developed are closing down due to the lack of appropriate assistance, is serious. The local government should conduct an in-depth examination of these issues and correct the erroneous attitude of neglecting handicraft production.

    The Blind Development of Handicraft Production in Zhumadian Resulted in the Collapse of Most Groups

    Letter from Shao Yunpei, Shi Zhimin, and Gan Yurun of the Zhumadian Town Cooperative General Society, Henan: From April to September last year, the Zhumadian Town Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, without considering actual needs and possibilities, blindly organized 72 handicraft production mutual aid groups, including chalk making, bamboo ware, wooden ware, toothbrush making, leather, umbrellas, soap, lime, straw hats, as well as blacksmithing, papermaking, clothing, rope making, barbering, grinding tofu, and frying fried dough sticks and other ten types of industries. Most of the members of these production mutual aid groups were put together temporarily, and the production conditions and equipment were very poor. As a result, due to the inability to buy raw materials, the inability to find sales channels for finished products, and poor management, most of them collapsed (a few groups were converted into shopkeepers). By the end of January this year, only 11 mutual aid groups remained in the town, and these mutual aid groups also had many problems and were in danger of collapsing.

### 应当重视手工业生产

专栏：读者来信摘要

    应当重视手工业生产
    编者按：下面选登的三封来信，反映了某些单位对待手工业生产的两种错误态度：一种是不根据需要和可能盲目发展，弄得供过于求，不可收拾时，又采取了取消主义的态度，干脆放任不管。沙市花纱布公司对待手工织布业的作法就属于这一种。另一种错误的态度，是对于可能和需要发展的手工业生产，却放弃了必要的扶持和关心，结果使那些农民需要的手工业生产不得不濒于歇业，影响了对广大人民的供应。黑龙江明水县手工业户逐渐减少的情况就是一个例子。我们希望这些读者来信能引起各地的重视，加强对手工业的领导，并切实检查和解决目前手工业生产中的问题，以便发挥手工业者生产的积极性。
    湖北沙市花纱布公司应检查
    对待手工织布业的错误做法
    湖北沙市手工业织布生产合作社胡松泽、赵祖义来信：一九五一年九月，沙市原有手工织布机两百多部，这些织布户多系自产自销，生意很好。一九五二年年初，沙市花纱布公司和市工商局盲目地号召其他行业普遍转入织布业，并强制原有织布户一律代公司加工，不得自行销售，否则不卖给棉纱。在这样的情况下，全市织布机一时竟增到一千多部，产生了供过于求的现象。同时也由于花纱布公司对加工户不给以切实的指导、监督，收货时不注意质量，因此积压了各色布四万多匹，折合现金七十六亿余元。这些布估计在一年内也销售不完。在这种情况下，花纱布公司就要我们“自产自销”，把我们推开不管了。但他们却又把纱价较加工时每小捆提高了三万元，迫使很多织布机因此停工，严重地影响了工人的生活。
    我们认为，沙市花纱布公司对手工织布业在事前盲目发展，事后又坐视倒闭的作法是错误的。
    黑龙江明水县的手工业户为什么愈来愈少
    读者王振华来信：读了四月二十三日人民日报社论“必须重视手工业”以后，使我联想到黑龙江省明水县手工业户逐渐减少的一些情况和问题。据一九五二年一月统计，全县有手工业一八九户，到同年十二月只剩下一二五户了，目前该县手工业户还在继续减少中。手工业户的减少，固然有一部分是因为不适于人民需要或供过于求，但有一部分却是不应该歇业而歇业了。例如制造镰刀、锄头的铁匠炉，在前年全县有二十五户，到去年年底只剩下了九户，其中有五户也将要停业。铁匠炉减少的原因，主要是买不到原料。当地农民家中的废铁都由各乡合作社统一收购，供给生产合作社使用，不卖给私营户；而工商部门又不帮助他们解决原料问题，听任他们自己到哈尔滨等地去收购，结果往往还是空跑回来，无法生产。如该县原有制造铧子（农具）炉两户，有一户在县合作社领导下，组成了铧子炉生产合作社，原料由各乡合作社统购废铁供给；另一户私营铧子炉因为买不到原料已经停业。实际上，合作社收购的铁，本身是用不完的；而生产合作社生产的铧子，又不能满足农民的需要。据估计：全县每年需要添补犁铧六千个，而铧子生产合作社仅仅只能供给四千个。
    我认为明水县一部分需要与可能发展的手工业，因为得不到适当的扶助而歇业的情况是严重的，当地政府应对这些问题进行一次深入的检查，纠正忽视手工业生产的错误态度。
    驻马店盲目发展手工业生产组结果大部垮台
    河南驻马店镇合作总社邵云霈、史致民、甘雨润同志来信：中共驻马店镇委会在去年四月至九月间，不根据实际需要和可能，盲目地组织了七十二个手工业生产互助小组，包括制粉笔、竹器、木器、牙刷、皮革、雨伞、肥皂、石灰、草帽，以及打铁、造纸、成衣、打绳、理发、磨豆腐、炸油条等十几种行业。这些生产互助组的成员，大部分是临时凑起来的，生产条件和设备都很差。结果由于买不到原料，成品找不到销路和经营不善等原因，绝大部分垮了台（其中有个别组转为座商）。到今年一月底，全镇只剩下十一个互助小组，而这些互助组也存在很多问题，有趋于垮台的危险。
