Xinhua News Agency, June 12th: The Guanting Reservoir project on the Yongding River achieved remarkable results in the "Red May" competition. All major projects have been completed ahead of schedule according to plan, providing a reliable guarantee for blocking floods during this year's flood season.

During the "Red May" competition, engineering and technical personnel established the idea of relying on the masses of workers and handed over the project plans to the masses, which inspired the labor enthusiasm and creativity of the vast number of employees, becoming the key to the early completion of the project. Engineers Huang Yuting and He Liang went to the workers' sheds many times to explain the significance of the dam project and the construction plan in plain language to the migrant workers. The on-site engineers and the cadres of the migrant worker brigades also established a "meeting," specifically studying the project requirements and construction arrangements before each work shift, so that everyone participating in the construction had a clear understanding and actively contributed their wisdom and strength. The impermeable material (clay) part of the dam center, which controls the progress of the dam project, was built to a height of 20 meters on June 1st, one day ahead of schedule, providing a reliable guarantee for the dam to block floods during the flood season. The overflow dam project on the east side of the dam, and the project of pouring 1,600 cubic meters of concrete on the west wall, were successfully completed on May 24th, seven days ahead of schedule, which strongly supported the progress of the dam project.

In addition, the concrete project for pouring the rear frame of the tower pier of the water inlet tower of the aqueduct has been completed six days ahead of schedule as originally planned. This created favorable conditions for the construction of the water inlet tower throughout the year. The entire concrete project of the stilling basin, totaling more than 4,000 cubic meters, was successfully poured four days ahead of schedule. Currently, the workers are working hard to dismantle the formwork and open the temporary water retaining wall to prepare for water diversion. The early completion of this project will reduce the threat of floods in front of the dam before the flood season and ensure the smooth progress of dam construction.

In early June, the Guanting Reservoir Committee of the Communist Party of China preliminarily summarized the experience and achievements of the "Red May" labor competition and called for continued patriotic labor competitions. The 40,000 employees are holding a common determination: to strive for greater victories, ensure flood control during the flood season, and welcome "July 1st."

    永定河官厅水库各项主要工程提前完工
    今年伏汛期拦阻洪水已有可靠的保证
    【新华社十二日讯】永定河官厅水库工程红五月竞赛成绩显著，各项主要工程都按计划提前完工，今年伏汛期拦阻洪水已有可靠保证。
    红五月竞赛中，工程技术人员树立依靠工人群众的思想，把工程计划交给群众，启发了广大职工的劳动热情和创造性，成为工程提前完成的关键。工程师黄宇庭、何量曾多次到工棚里，通俗地给民工们讲解拦河坝工程的意义和施工计划。现场工程师和民工大队干部还建立了“碰头会”，每上班前具体研究工程要求和施工布置，使所有参加施工的人作到心中有数，积极贡献出自己的智慧和力量。控制拦河坝工程进度的坝中心不透水料（粘土）部分，于六月一日按计划提前一天建筑到二十公尺高，拦河坝在汛期拦洪已有可靠保证。拦河坝东边的溢洪道工程，西边墙浇筑混凝土一千六百公方的工程，早于五月二十四日按计划提前七天胜利完成，有力地配合了拦河坝工程的进展。
    另外，有关输水道进水塔浇筑塔墩后部框架部分的混凝土工程，已照原计划提前六天完工。给进水塔全年施工创造了有利条件。静水池全部混凝土工程四千多方公尺，提前四天浇筑成功，现工人们正紧张地拆除模型板和打通临时挡水墙，准备导水。这一工程提前完工，将减免伏汛前拦河坝前的洪水威胁，保证筑坝顺利进展。
    六月初，中共官厅水库委员会初步总结了红五月劳动竞赛的经验和成就，号召继续开展爱国主义劳动竞赛。四万员工抱着共同的决心：争取更大胜利，确保汛期拦洪，迎接“七一”。
