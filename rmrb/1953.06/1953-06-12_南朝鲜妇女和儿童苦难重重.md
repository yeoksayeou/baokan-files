Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 11th—Under the rule of the American aggressor troops and the Syngman Rhee bandit gang, South Korean women and children are suffering in dire straits. According to news from Seoul, since the US-Rhee bandits launched the war, they have been conscripting cannon fodder everywhere in South Korea and massacring patriotic people, which has taken the husbands of more than 500,000 South Korean women. Many women, even young girls, have been forcibly dragged into military brothels by the US-Rhee bandit troops and brutally ravaged by them. Because they cannot endure the inhuman life of humiliation and starvation, incidents of South Korean women committing suicide with their children by jumping into rivers and wells are endless. Many mothers are forced to abandon their own flesh and blood; in Busan alone, more than 660 babies and children have been abandoned in the past year. According to the Syngman Rhee puppet government, there are now 320,000 homeless vagrant children in South Korea who live by begging on the streets of Seoul, Busan, and Daegu. Tens of thousands of children are forced to become thieves. The infant mortality rate in South Korea has reached 22 percent.

    南朝鲜妇女和儿童苦难重重
    【新华社平壤十一日电】在美国侵略军和李承晚匪帮的统治下，南朝鲜妇女和儿童正在水深火热中受着煎熬。据汉城消息，美、李匪帮发动战争以来，在南朝鲜到处强征炮灰，屠杀爱国人民，已夺去了五十多万南朝鲜妇女的丈夫。许多妇女以至幼女被美、李匪军强拉到军妓院，惨遭美、李匪军的蹂躏。因为忍受不了污辱和挨饿的非人生活，南朝鲜妇女抱着儿女投江跳井自杀的事件层出不穷。许多母亲被迫丢弃亲生骨肉，仅仅在釜山市，一年来就有六百六十多个婴儿和儿童被遗弃。据李承晚伪政府透露，现在南朝鲜有三十二万无家可归的流浪儿童，他们在汉城、釜山和大邱的街头靠讨饭为生，成千上万的儿童被迫沦为小偷。南朝鲜的婴儿死亡率已达到百分之二十二。
