    Shijiazhuang Industrial School Disregards Student Health
    Letters from two teachers and one student at Hebei Province's Shijiazhuang Industrial School: Our school's administrative leaders adopt an irresponsible attitude towards student health. On June 2nd, more than forty students suddenly experienced vomiting, diarrhea, and high fevers. At the time, the school leaders did not pay attention to this situation. By the morning of the next day, the number of sick students suddenly increased to more than one hundred and seventy (more than a quarter of the total student population), and the symptoms were similar. The reason for this situation is that the school leadership usually doesn't pay attention to student meals. The student canteen management personnel are largely unclear about how many people eat each day or how much grain is needed. Therefore, a lot of steamed buns or corn bread are often left over. Sometimes the food has been sitting for two or three days, has hardened and gone bad, but the administrators still insist that the students eat it, otherwise they won't make new food. There are many bugs in the cold vegetable dishes, sometimes even live ones, and students feel like vomiting after eating them. Students have many opinions about the food, and the opinion book is filled, but the canteen administrators only "explain," and the school leaders do not deal with it. The students' drinking water situation is also very bad. There are three male and female toilets near the drinking water well, with many flies and unclean water sources. Our teachers and students have twice suggested to the school leaders that the toilets be moved, and the reply is always: "It will be done soon," but nothing happens after that. There is only one school doctor in the whole school, but there are too many patients who need treatment and care, and they simply cannot cope, so many patients do not receive timely diagnosis and treatment. The classroom lights are too dim, and after students study on their own at night, some of them experience dizziness and blurred vision, causing many students to become nearsighted or suffer from insomnia and other illnesses. Students have raised concerns more than once, but the situation has not improved to this day.
    In addition, the schoolwork is too heavy, and many courses use university or college lecture notes. The time that general students participate in club activities exceeds three hours per week, sometimes reaching five or six hours; student cadres and Communist Youth League members generally spend more than five hours, and some even reach eight hours.
    The above situation is very harmful to students' health. We hope that the school leaders will quickly pay attention to this situation and improve it.

### 石家庄工业学校不重视学生健康

专栏：读者来信摘要

    石家庄工业学校不重视学生健康
    河北省石家庄工业学校两位教员和一位学生来信：我校行政领导干部对学生健康采取不负责任的态度。六月二日，有四十多个学生突然上吐下泻，发高热。当时学校领导干部对这种情况不加注意。第二天上午，患病的同学突然增加到一百七十多人
    （占学生总人数四分之一强），病情都相仿佛。发生这种情况的原因是：学校领导方面平时对学生伙食不闻不问。学生膳团管理人员对每天究竟有多少人吃饭、需粮食多少都不大清楚，所以经常剩下很多的馒头或窝窝头，有时食物已经搁了两三天，已经发硬和变味了，管理员还一定要学生吃，否则就不做新的。凉拌的蔬菜里虫子很多，有时甚至还有活虫，同学们吃完就想吐。学生对伙食意见很多，意见簿写满了，而伙食管理员只是“解释解释”，学校领导方面也不加处理。学生饮水状况也很坏，饮水井附近有男女厕所三个，苍蝇很多，水源不洁。我校师生曾向学校领导方面两次提出迁移厕所的意见，答复总是：“很快就办”，但以后就无下文。全校只有一名校医，而需要治疗、照顾的病号太多，根本忙不过来，许多病号因而得不到及时的诊治。教室电灯光太暗，同学晚上自习后，有的人就头昏眼花，致使许多学生成了近视眼或者患了失眠等病症。同学们不止一次地提意见，但直到今天情况还没有改善。
    此外，学校功课太重，许多课程采用了大学或专科学校的讲义。一般学生参加的社团活动时间每周都超过三小时，有时到五、六小时；学生干部和青年团员普遍在五小时以上，甚至有达八小时的。
    上述情况对学生健康的危害很大。希望学校领导方面迅速重视这种情况，并予以改善。
