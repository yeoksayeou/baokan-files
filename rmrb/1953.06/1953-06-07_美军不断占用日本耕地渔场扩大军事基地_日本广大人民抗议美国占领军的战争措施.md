Xinhua News Agency, June 5th, Tokyo dispatch: The establishment of military bases by the United States in Japan has severely impacted the area of Japanese farmland. According to a recent survey report by the Yoshida government's Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, in the past year, the Yoshida government has allocated 170,000 acres (one acre equals six Chinese mu) of farmland and forest to the U.S. occupation forces stationed in Japan for use as airfields and training grounds, based on the U.S.-Japan "Administrative Agreement." The survey report reveals that the Yoshida government is preparing to allocate another 190,000 acres of land to the U.S. occupation forces.

As the Yoshida government actively conducts combat training for the "Security Forces" and prepares to expand the "Security Forces" personnel, the land occupied by the "Security Forces" will also increase significantly. The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry's survey report indicates that the land currently occupied by the "Security Forces" is 4,000 acres and will be expanded nearly tenfold, reaching a total of 39,000 acres. The large amount of farmland requisitioned for military use is further worsening the already insufficient food situation in Japan. The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry admits that the requisitioning of farmland by the U.S. occupation forces and the Japanese "Security Forces" will reduce Japan's rice production by more than 4.7 million liters (one liter equals one Chinese deciliter) annually.

The endless expansion of military bases in Japan by the U.S. occupation forces has aroused increasingly widespread opposition from the Japanese people. Recently, the U.S. military's demand to use Mount Asama (between Gunma and Nagano prefectures), a scenic spot and geological research site, and Mount Myogi in Gunma Prefecture as mountain combat training grounds for the U.S. military has aroused angry protests among people of all walks of life. On May 27th, the Nagano Prefectural Assembly unanimously passed a resolution opposing the U.S. military's occupation of Mount Asama. On June 1st, representatives of more than 70 organizations, including the Nagano Prefectural Anti-Military Base Alliance, and representatives of the people of Gunma Prefecture, totaling 80 people, went to Tokyo to submit a resolution opposing the U.S. military's establishment of training grounds on Mount Asama to the Yoshida government and the Speaker of the Japanese Diet. People from all walks of life in Nagano and Gunma prefectures have formed the Anti-Myogi Mountain and Asama Mountain Training Ground Alliance, and on the 3rd, they submitted a resolution firmly opposing the U.S. military's use of Mount Myogi and Mount Asama as training grounds to the Yoshida government. On the same day, a delegation of 45 representatives of residents from Gunma and Nagano prefectures went to the U.S. Far East Army Headquarters in Yokohama to protest the U.S. military's attempt to establish military training grounds in these two prefectures.

Xinhua News Agency, June 5th, Tokyo dispatch: The U.S. military bases scattered throughout Japan not only occupy a large amount of Japanese territory but also extend into large areas of Japanese territorial waters and the seabed, destroying the livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of Japanese fishermen.

There are a total of 36 U.S. military bases in Japan related to fishing, including 17 belonging to the Navy, 12 to the Air Force, and 7 to the Army. Large areas of the sea near these bases have been designated as off-limits to fishermen. In addition, the U.S. military has designated sea areas equivalent to one-eighth of Japan's total land area around Japan as training grounds, where U.S. warships rampage, and shells and bombs fly around during exercises, often injuring Japanese fishing boats and fishermen. Furthermore, the United States has laid so-called anti-submarine nets in fishing areas such as Tokyo Bay and Sasebo, prohibiting fishing with nets by all fishing boats, regardless of size.

U.S. military facilities have greatly affected Japan's fish production. According to statistics, the average annual fish production in the Tokyo Bay fishing ground was 11,594,400 kan (one kan equals 7.5 Chinese jin) from 1948 to 1950. After the U.S. military laid anti-submarine nets in 1951, fish production decreased by more than half, causing fishermen to lose 2.3 billion yen, and more than 20,000 fishermen lost their livelihoods. The proportion of losses suffered by fishermen near Sasebo due to U.S. anti-submarine nets is even greater. From 1948 to 1950, the average annual fish production in this area was 752,000 kan, which decreased by more than 75 percent in 1951, with only 182,000 kan produced. The U.S. military's use of the fishing area along the Kujukuri beach as a firing range has caused even more appalling losses to Japanese fishermen. Before the war, the average annual fish production in this area was 30 million kan, but after the war, the average annual fish production was only 780,000 kan. In total, more than 210,000 fishermen across Japan have been deprived of their livelihoods due to the U.S. turning Japan into a military base, with an annual loss of more than 66.6 million kan of fish production.

The destruction of the lives of the Japanese people by the U.S. coastal military bases has made the anger of the Japanese people increasingly high. The Ishikawa Prefecture's strong opposition to turning the prefecture's Uchinada Village into a permanent firing range for the U.S. military is a typical example. According to Kyodo News, the Yoshida government, "disregarding the opposition of the local people, and even disregarding the unanimous opposition of all the people of Ishikawa Prefecture," decided on the 2nd to continue to provide Uchinada Village in Ishikawa Prefecture, on which the people mainly rely on fishing for their livelihood, to the U.S. military as a firing range indefinitely, which has "caused a fierce opposition movement." Kyodo News said: "The breadth of the strata of this movement is unmatched by similar movements in the past. Therefore, if the government intends to get by with a perfunctory approach, a major upheaval will inevitably occur."

### 美军不断占用日本耕地渔场扩大军事基地  日本广大人民抗议美国占领军的战争措施

    美军不断占用日本耕地渔场扩大军事基地
    日本广大人民抗议美国占领军的战争措施
    【新华社五日讯】东京消息：美国在日本建立军事基地，使日本耕地面积受到严重的影响。根据吉田政府农林省最近的调查报告，吉田政府一年来根据美日“行政协定”划给美国驻日占领军做飞机场和练兵场的耕地和森林已达十七万英亩（一英亩合六市亩）。调查报告透露，吉田政府正准备再将十九万英亩的土地划给美国占领军。
    随着吉田政府积极对“保安队”进行作战训练，并准备扩大“保安队”兵员，“保安队”占用的土地也将大量增加。农林省的调查报告表明：“保安队”占用的土地现有四千英亩，将扩充到近十倍，共达三万九千英亩。大量的耕地被征作军用，使本来已感不足的日本粮食的情况更加恶化。农林省承认，美国占领军和日本“保安队”对耕地的征用将使日本米产量每年减少四百七十多万公升（一公升等于一市升）。
    美国占领军漫无止境地扩大它在日本的军事基地，激起日本人民越来越广泛的反对。最近美军要求以日本的名胜地和地质研究场所浅间山（在群马县和长野县之间）、群马县的妙义山做美军山地作战训练场的事情，在广大阶层人民中间引起了愤怒的抗议。长野县议会在五月二十七日全体一致通过决议，反对美军占用浅间山。六月一日，长野县的反对军事基地同盟等七十多个团体的代表八十人和群马县人民代表，到东京向吉田政府和日本国会议长提出反对美军在浅间山设置演习场的决议书。长野县和群马县各阶层人民已组成反对妙义山和浅间山两演习场同盟，并在三日将坚决反对美军以妙义山和浅间山为演习场的决议书提交吉田政府。同日，由群马县和长野县居民代表四十五人组成的代表团到设在横滨的美国远东陆军司令部，抗议美军企图在这两县设立军事训练场。
    【新华社五日讯】东京消息：遍布在日本的美国军事基地不仅霸占了日本的大量领土，而且伸入到日本大片领海和海底，破坏了数以十万计的日本渔民的生计。
    美国在日本的与渔业有关的军事基地共有三十六个，其中属海军的十七个、属空军的十二个、属陆军的七个。在这些基地附近都划出面积很大的海面禁止渔民捕鱼。此外，驻日美军并在日本四周划出相当于日本全国陆地面积八分之一的海面做演习场，在这里，美国军舰横冲直撞，演习时炮弹和炸弹乱飞，经常伤害日本的渔船和渔民。此外，美国还在东京湾和佐世保等渔场区布设了所谓防潜艇网，无论大小渔船都不准下网打鱼。
    美国的军事设施大大地影响了日本的鱼产量。据统计，东京湾渔场的鱼产量从一九四八年到一九五○年每年平均为一千一百五十九万四千贯（每贯合七点五市斤），一九五一年美军布设防潜艇网后，鱼产量减少了一半以上，渔民损失二十三亿日元，二万多渔民丧失了生计。佐世保附近的渔民受美国防潜艇网的损失比例更大。一九四八年到一九五○年这一带每年平均产鱼七十五万二千贯，一九五一年减少了百分之七十五以上，只产鱼十八万二千贯。美军以九十九里海滨沿岸的渔场区做打靶场使日本渔民遭到的损失更为惊人。战前这一带每年平均产鱼三千万贯，战后每年平均鱼产量只有七十八万贯。总计日本全国由于美国把日本变为军事基地而被剥夺了生计的渔民共达二十一万多人，每年鱼产量损失六千六百多万贯。
    美国沿海军事基地对日本人民生活的破坏已使日本人民的愤怒越来越高涨。石川县全县强烈反对把该县的内滩村变为美军的永久打靶场的运动，就是一个典型例子。据共同社报道，吉田政府“不顾当地人民的反对，甚至不顾全石川县人民的一致反对”，在二日仍决定将石川县内人民主要赖渔业维生的内滩村继续无限期供美军作打靶场，已“引起了猛烈的反对运动”。共同社说：“这个运动的阶层的广泛是过去这类运动所不能比拟的。因此，政府如果打算只以敷衍一时的办法搪塞过去，就不可避免地会发生一场大风潮。”
