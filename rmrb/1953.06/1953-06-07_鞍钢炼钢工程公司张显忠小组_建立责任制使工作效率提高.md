Zhang Xianzong group workers of the Concrete Team of the Steelmaking Engineering Company of Anshan Iron and Steel Company strengthened their sense of responsibility in the movement against waste, against lack of responsibility, and for the establishment of a responsibility system, which greatly improved the work of the whole group. For example, when pouring the foundation of the water supply station of the large rolling mill, they inspected the construction according to the regulations and found that two supports of the "box plate" were not strong and there were large gaps in many places. At this time, the workers of the Zhang Xianzong group repaired it themselves, avoiding a serious accident caused by the "box plate" expanding during construction and forcing work to stop. In mid-May, when the group workers carried out the second pouring (pouring concrete under the machine base), they jointly studied and improved the tools used for blowing, increasing the wind power, which resulted in the dirt on the surface of the foundation being blown away quickly and cleanly. The work that originally took six days to complete is now completed in just over three days, allowing some machinery to be tested earlier and providing advanced methods for improving the second pouring work of the entire site.

    鞍钢炼钢工程公司张显忠小组
    建立责任制使工作效率提高
    国营鞍山钢铁公司炼钢工程公司混凝土队张显忠小组的工人，在反浪费、反无人负责和建立责任制运动中，加强了责任观念，使全组工作有了很大的改进。如在浇灌大型轧钢厂给水站基础时，施工前按照制度进行了检查，结果发现“盒子板”有两处支撑不牢固，好多地方还有很大空隙。这时，张显忠小组的工人就自己动手修理好，避免了施工中因“盒子板”涨开而造成被迫停工的严重事故。五月中旬，该小组工人进行第二次浇灌（机座下部浇灌混凝土）时，共同研究改进了吹风用的工具，加大了风力，结果使基础面上的脏东西吹得又快又干净，原先要六天做完的工作，现在三天多就完成了，部分机械因此可以提前试运转，并为改进整个工地的第二次浇灌工作提供了先进的方法。
