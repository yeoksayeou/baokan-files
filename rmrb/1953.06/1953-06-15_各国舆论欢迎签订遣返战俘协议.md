Xinhua News Agency, Prague, June 14th: The Romanian newspaper "Spark" published a lengthy commentary on the 12th, stating that the Panmunjom agreement on the issue of prisoners of war, which is universally welcomed by the people of the world, opens up prospects for ending the Korean War and peacefully resolving the Korean issue. At the same time, this is also an important step forward in easing international tensions, which the people are eagerly hoping for.

"Spark" continued: Undoubtedly, the achievement of this agreement and every step taken towards achieving the goals of a ceasefire and peaceful resolution of the Korean issue are a great achievement of the forces of peace. The Romanian people, like all peace-loving people, know that in order to rapidly stop the bloodshed in Korea, the people need now more than ever to resolutely express their will to strive for peace.

Xinhua News Agency, Prague, June 14th: The New York "Daily Worker" published an editorial on June 9th, welcoming the agreement on the issue of prisoners of war and the prospect of a Korean armistice, considering it a great victory for the people over the warmongers, speculators, and their political lackeys. The editorial pointed out: only "due to the brave and persistent struggle of the Korean people, the Chinese people, and the Soviet people, and due to the brave and persistent struggle of democratic forces in other countries and within the United States, have the belligerents been compelled to bring the armistice negotiations to their current stage of progress."

The editorial warned that the likes of Eisenhower, McCarthy, Taft, and Knowland in Washington are still trying to prevent China from joining the United Nations and continue to collude with the politically bankrupt bandit gangs of Syngman Rhee and Chiang Kai-shek. The editorial referred to the "mutual assistance agreement" that Eisenhower promised to conclude with Syngman Rhee, and asked: "Isn't this attitude towards the Syngman Rhee bandit gang the same as Truman's past attitude of interfering in the Korean civil war?"

The editorial continued: Continuing to infringe upon China's sovereignty, controlling Taiwan and funding the Chiang bandit gang is an act of hostility towards the great Chinese people, who account for a quarter of the world's population, and it is by no means a path to genuine peace.

The editorial said: "Once a Korean armistice is achieved, it will not be a gift from the warmongers and interventionists, but an armistice that the people have forced the warmongers to realize!"

The "Daily Worker" concluded: There will be many problems after the armistice and ceasefire, but no problem cannot be resolved through negotiation. The editorial concluded: "Now, on the eve of the ceasefire, the victory that the people have won over the warmongers should inspire us to make new efforts."

Xinhua News Agency, Prague, June 14th: The French newspaper "L'Humanité" published editorials on June 8th and 9th, commenting on the great significance of the agreement on the issue of prisoners of war and the imminent armistice in the Korean armistice negotiations. The newspaper believes that this finally proves that the efforts and repeated initiatives of the Soviet Union, China, and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to seek peace have been fruitful. "L'Humanité" recalled how the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers defeated the fierce military offensive of the world's largest imperialism and its satellite countries, who used various inhumane and illegal methods of warfare, including terror bombing, the dropping of napalm bombs, and germ warfare, to deal with the Korean people and army. The newspaper also said: "This proves once again that nothing can defeat a nation determined to defend its freedom, and that such a nation will inevitably achieve victory, no matter the circumstances."

"L'Humanité" said that in Korea, the spirit of solving problems through negotiation has triumphed over the spirit of "solving problems by force," which points out a way to solve other wars and international problems in a peaceful manner. This is a major contribution to defending world peace.

But L'Humanité warned that it would be a big mistake to think that all parties would willingly sign the armistice agreement. Yes, Eisenhower admitted that "we have no reason to prolong the war" and reluctantly bowed to the Sino-Korean peace proposals and the world's strong condemnation of the American aggression against Korea. But in the same document, Eisenhower supported Syngman Rhee's plan, whose so-called resistance was merely a disguise for the United States' future plans to re-invade.

"L'Humanité" warned that the imperialists will never abandon their plans for suppression and force. Therefore, it is still necessary to maintain constant vigilance and the actions of the masses must be constantly maintained.

Xinhua News Agency, June 14th: TASS Delhi, June 12th: Dr. Saifuddin Kitchlew, Chairman of the All-India Peace Council, held a press conference in Delhi on the 11th. He emphasized that the agreement on the repatriation of prisoners of war signed in Korea has created an atmosphere conducive to further easing international tensions and achieving an armistice in Korea.

Kitchlew finally announced that an Indian delegation of twenty people will go to Budapest to attend the World Peace Council meeting.

Xinhua News Agency, Prague, June 14th: The London "Daily Worker" of June 11th reported that the British National Women's Congress issued a statement saying that the news of the agreement on the Korean prisoner of war issue was "received with extreme joy by everyone, especially the mothers and wives of soldiers in Korea." The statement continued, "We know that this is only the first step in our efforts to achieve lasting peace. We are encouraged by the news that the people's efforts to strive for peace have finally yielded results, and we call on women everywhere to join us in going to the House of Commons on June 25th. Let us tell our parliamentarians that now that peace in Korea is in sight, we want our people to come home quickly.

We must let the government know that British women demand that the conference of great powers not be delayed. We must insist that if the United States hesitates, then Britain must take the initiative."

Xinhua News Agency, June 14th: Yangon News: Burmese newspapers denounced the Syngman Rhee bandit gang's clamor against the armistice. The "New Era Daily" said that Syngman Rhee's recent clownish attitude is extremely ridiculous. This Syngman Rhee, who is riding in a United Nations jeep on the Seoul highway, must regard himself as the greatest anti-communist hero of the contemporary era, but the cool-headed world is laughing at him. The newspaper pointed out that it is noteworthy that when the whole world is making tense efforts for peace, the weak Syngman Rhee dares to be reckless and clamor for war. The newspaper said that observers have to suspect whether this war clamor is Syngman Rhee's true voice, or whether he is just a scapegoat acting as a megaphone.

The "Progress Daily" pointed out that Syngman Rhee has no power without his American masters, and today he dares to clamor arrogantly for a separate war. This is obviously the result of his masters' instigation, which should arouse the attention and vigilance of the whole world.

    各国舆论欢迎签订遣返战俘协议
    【新华社布拉格十四日电】罗马尼亚“火花报”十二日发表长篇评论说：全世界人民普遍欢迎的板门店关于战俘问题的协议，开拓了停止朝鲜战争与和平解决朝鲜问题的前景。同时，这也是在人民所热切渴望的缓和国际局势方面的一个重要进展。
    “火花报”继续说：无疑的，这个协议的达成以及朝着实现停战与和平解决朝鲜问题的目标所迈进的每一步，都是和平力量的伟大成就。罗马尼亚人民和所有爱好和平的人民一样，都知道为了要使朝鲜的流血迅速停止，人民在现在比任何时候都更需要坚决地表示他们争取和平的意志。
    【新华社布拉格十四日电】纽约“工人日报”六月九日发表社论，欢迎关于战俘问题的协议和朝鲜停战的前景，认为这是人民对战争制造者和投机商人以及他们的政治走狗所取得的伟大胜利。社论指出：只是“由于朝鲜人民、中国人民和苏联人民的勇敢而坚持的斗争，由于其他国家和美国国内的民主力量的勇敢而坚持的斗争，好战者才不得已而使停战谈判进入目前有进展的阶段”。
    社论警告说，华盛顿的艾森豪威尔、麦卡锡、塔夫脱和诺兰之流，仍然企图阻止中国加入联合国，并且继续与李承晚、蒋介石这些政治破产了的匪帮勾结。社论谈到艾森豪威尔答应和李承晚缔结的
    “互助协定”，它问道：“这种对李承晚匪帮的态度，和杜鲁门过去所采取的干涉朝鲜内战的态度，不是一样的吗？”
    社论继续写道：继续侵犯中国的主权，控制台湾并且资助蒋匪帮，这是对占世界人口四分之一的伟大的中国人民的一种敌对行为，同时这决不是通向真正的和平的道路。
    社论说：“朝鲜停战一旦实现，那也不是战争制造者和干涉者送的礼物，而是人民迫使战争制造者实现的停战！”
    “工人日报”结语说：在停战和停火以后还会有许多问题，但是没有任何问题是不能够通过谈判来解决的。社论最后说：“现在，在停火的前夕，人民向战争制造者所取得的胜利，应该鼓舞我们进行新的努力。”
    【新华社布拉格十四日电】六月八日和九日的法国“人道报”发表社论，评论朝鲜停战谈判中关于战俘问题的协议和即将实现的停战的重大意义。该报认为这终于证明了苏联、中国和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国谋求和平的努力和多次主动是有成果的。“人道报”回忆朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军如何战胜了世界上最大帝国主义及其卫星国的凶恶的军事进攻，帝国主义者们曾用各种不人道和非法的战争方式，包括恐怖空袭、投掷凝固汽油弹、细菌战来对付朝鲜人民和军队。该报又说：“这再一次证明，没有一样东西能打得倒一个决心要保卫自己的自由的民族，不论形势怎么样，这样的民族必然会得到胜利。”
    “人道报”说，在朝鲜，以谈判来解决问题的精神战胜了“武力解决”的精神，这事指出了一条用和平方式来解决其他战争以及国际问题的道路。这在保卫全世界和平上是个重大的贡献。
    但是人道报警告说，如果以为各方都会甘心情愿地签订停战协议，那就大错特错了。是的，艾森豪威尔承认“我们没有一点理由来延长战争”，并且无可奈何地在中朝的和平建议以及全世界对美国侵略朝鲜的强有力指责面前低头。但是艾森豪威尔在同一文件中又支持了李承晚的计划，后者的所谓反抗不过是掩饰美国将来打算重新侵略罢了。
    “人道报”警告说，帝国主义绝不会放弃它们的镇压和武力计划。因此，今后仍然必需经常保持警惕，必须经常保持人民大众的行动。
    【新华社十四日讯】塔斯社德里十二日讯：全印和平理事会主席赛福丁·克其鲁博士十一日在德里举行记者招待会。他强调说：在朝鲜签订的关于遣返战俘的协议，已经产生了有利于进一步缓和国际紧张局势和实现朝鲜停战的气氛。
    克其鲁最后宣布：一个由二十人组成的印度代表团将前往布达佩斯参加世界和平理事会会议。
    【新华社布拉格十四日电】六月十一日的伦敦“工人日报”报道，英国全国妇女大会发表声明说：朝鲜战俘问题获得协议的新闻，“受到大家极其高兴的欢迎，尤其是在朝鲜的士兵的母亲和妻子们”。声明继续说，“我们知道，这不过是我们为谋取持久和平所作的努力的第一步。人民争取和平的努力终于取得成果的消息使我们鼓舞，我们号召各处的妇女在六月二十五日和我们一起到下议院去。让我们告诉我们的议员，现在朝鲜和平已经在望了，我们要我们的人赶快回来。
    我们一定要让政府知道，英国妇女要求不要拖延大国会议的举行。我们一定要坚持：如果美国犹豫不决的话。那么英国必须采取主动。”
    【新华社十四日讯】仰光消息：缅甸报纸痛斥李承晚匪帮的反对停战的叫嚣。“新时代日报”说，李承晚近来表现的小丑态度极为可笑。这位坐在联合国吉普车里驰骋在汉城公路上的李承晚，一定把自己看作是当代最伟大的反共英雄，可是冷静的世界却在嘲笑他。该报指出，当全世界正在为和平而紧张努力的时候，软弱的李承晚却敢胆大妄为，叫嚣战争，这是值得注意的。该报说，观察家们不得不怀疑，这种战争叫嚣是不是李承晚的真正呼声，还是他只不过是一只充当传声筒的替死的羔羊。
    “进步日报”指出，李承晚离开他的美国主子就没有半点力量，今天竟然敢狂妄地叫嚣单独进行战争，这显然是他的主子教唆的结果，这一点应该引起全世界的注意和警惕。
