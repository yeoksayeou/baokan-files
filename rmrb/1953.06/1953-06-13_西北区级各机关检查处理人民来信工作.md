Northwest Region level organs, since the beginning of the anti-bureaucracy struggle in February of this year, have all, in accordance with the central instructions, conducted an inspection of the work of handling people's letters and visits. The General Office of the Northwest Administrative Committee convened a reporting meeting of its subordinate organs. The Discipline Inspection Commission of the CCP Central Committee Northwest Bureau and the Northwest People's Supervisory Committee both held two meetings on handling people's letters in March of this year. On May 8, the CCP Central Committee Northwest Bureau convened a special meeting on the work of handling people's letters and visits, bringing together forty-eight units, including Party and government organs, industrial and mining enterprises, health departments, and mass organizations at the Northwest Region level. At the meeting, Comrade Ma Wenrui, Deputy Secretary of the CCP Central Committee Northwest Bureau, gave a report and determined the steps and methods for the Northwest Region organs to conduct key in-depth inspections and handle problems.

From the results of this inspection, since the "Three-Anti" movement last year, the Northwest Region organs have generally improved their handling of people's letters. Many organs have begun to attach importance to this work, assigning dedicated personnel to be responsible and establishing and improving systems for receiving, registering, forwarding, urging, reporting back, summarizing, and reporting. Some have also formulated detailed rules for handling people's letters and stipulated that responsible cadres should personally review important letters. For example, the Judicial Administration Section of the Northwest Branch of the Supreme People's Court is very serious about answering policy-related questions. Sometimes a draft goes through several revisions, and the drafter or the leading cadre who reviews the draft consults reference books and relevant documents to find theoretical and legal bases, and conducts repeated research. Sometimes they also convene meetings of relevant cadres to collectively discuss.

Due to the increasing importance attached to people's letters by the organs, the people's trust in the Party and the People's Government has increased, and the number of letters has also gradually increased. According to statistics from the General Office of the CCP Central Committee Northwest Bureau, the Discipline Inspection Commission of the Northwest Bureau, the Northwest Administrative Committee, and the Northwest People's Supervisory Committee: a total of 4,442 letters from the people were received in 1952 (excluding denunciation letters during the "Three-Anti" movement), an increase of 2,159 over 1951. The problems reflected covered many aspects. Especially after the struggle against bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of law and discipline began this year, some bad people and bad deeds have been exposed and dealt with in various places, which has encouraged and supported the broad masses of people to fight against violators of law and discipline and bureaucrats, and the number of people's letters has increased significantly. The number of letters received by the General Office of the Northwest Bureau in April this year increased fourfold compared with the average monthly number of letters received in 1952. The events reflected in these people's letters are mostly true and extremely rich in content, enabling the leading organs to discover many problems. For example, all fifty-five letters from the masses accusing cadres that were transferred by the General Office of the Northwest Administrative Committee in 1952 to various places for investigation and handling and had already been reported as closed, were factual. The masses in Dabaizi Village, Xingping County, Shaanxi Province, reflected that the local primary school was engaged in the "Three-Anti" movement in a chaotic manner, putting forward the slogan of "anti-theft, anti-truancy, anti-beating and scolding," and forcing students to confess in public meetings in a struggle-like manner, causing chaos in the school and having a very bad impact on the masses. After the Northwest Education Bureau transferred the case to the Shaanxi Provincial Department of Culture and Education for investigation and handling and notified various places, it played a great role in correcting the chaotic phenomena in many schools at that time. Another example is that in January 1952, Shi Hanjie, a cadre of the Northwest Public Security Department, reflected that his mother was being treated for an eye disease in the ophthalmology department of the Affiliated Hospital of the Northwest Medical College, and improper handling led to symptoms such as right eye fusion after the operation. After investigation and understanding by the Northwest Health Bureau in coordination with the Xi'an People's Court, it was proved that there were indeed improprieties, and a meeting of ophthalmologists from major hospitals in Xi'an was convened to discuss and study, correct the irresponsible work style of the ophthalmology department of the Affiliated Hospital of the Northwest Medical College, and educate the medical staff.

Although the work of handling people's letters in the Northwest Region organs has improved, the inspection has also exposed many shortcomings and serious problems. Specifically, these are reflected in:

1.  Many organs lack inspection and leadership in handling people's letters, and some even ignore them. There are still not many leading cadres who personally review and handle people's letters and receive people's visits. Some cadres believe that the work of handling people's letters and visits has "no great future," and some regard the opinions of the masses as "trouble" and "for personal gain," etc.; therefore, they adopt a perfunctory attitude, do not carefully study the people's letters, simply copy and forward them, push them out the door, and do not urge them to be handled, or even if they are urged, they are not handled. Some directly responsible units do not investigate and handle the received letters in a timely manner, forming a serious backlog. According to incomplete statistics from the departments of the Northwest Administrative Committee, 1,039 letters transferred down in 1952 were not reported as closed, accounting for 40% of the total number of letters received throughout the year. In industrial and mining enterprises, neglecting the opinions of employees is also quite serious. For example, the Yumen Oil Mine had more than 1,000 rationalization proposals from employees accumulated around April last year.

2.  The system is not sound, there are too few full-time cadres, and the responsibilities of part-time cadres are not clear. Before the start of this anti-bureaucracy struggle, many organs did not even have a receiving and registering system, and some mixed them up with general official documents, making it impossible to find out how many people's letters were received in 1952 and how they were handled. Setting up suggestion boxes is also not common, and some are just formalities. For example, when the Northwest Branch of the People's Bank of China recently inspected the suggestion box, it found that a letter had been placed in it for more than half a year. Forty-two letters from the masses were also accumulated in the suggestion box of the former Northwest Finance Department. Many organs lack periodic inspection, summary, and reporting systems, lack unified management, and are in a state of chaos. There is also a lack of contact between units, and some shirk responsibility to each other, causing the masses to run back and forth, and the problems cannot be solved.

3.  Individual organs not only do not seriously handle people's letters, but also conceal the truth and make false reports to higher authorities. For example, in August last year, in order to establish a mechanized farming practice farm, the Northwest Agricultural College decided without authorization to take back more than 1,100 mu of land leased to 137 peasant households in six nearby villages, and forced the peasants to put their fingerprints on the lease accounts. The peasants were very dissatisfied and wrote to Chairman Mao three times. However, when the Northwest Bureau transferred the letters from the masses to the college to be responsible for handling, the college still believed that the occurrence of the matter was due to "the ideological problems of a few peasants not being resolved," and only sent a work team to conduct a "persuasion" and announced that those with more labor could be absorbed as farm workers, and then reported to the Northwest Bureau that "the problem has been resolved." In fact, the peasants' problems were not resolved. Moreover, there were phenomena of work team cadres threatening and insulting the peasants, which caused even greater dissatisfaction among the peasants. It was not until the Northwest Bureau sent a work team this year that the problem was properly resolved. These facts all show that some organ cadres still have serious bureaucratic work styles, lack a mass viewpoint, and do not understand the important significance of handling people's letters and the consistency of being responsible to the Party and being responsible to the people.

After this inspection, the cadres' understanding has been significantly improved, and they have generally adopted a more serious and responsible attitude towards handling people's letters, and the processing speed has also been improved. According to the inspection by the Discipline Inspection Commission of the Northwest Bureau and the Northwest People's Supervisory Committee: since the meeting held on March 20, most units have been able to seriously carry out this work. The Discipline Inspection Commission of the Northwest Bureau completed seven of the ten cases that were scheduled to be closed by the end of March as scheduled. The Northwest People's Supervisory Committee has reported the closure of 80 of the 191 cases scheduled to be closed; among them, ten units and thirty-seven cases were fully closed from March 20 to the end of the month; seven units reported the closure of more than half of the cases; and those who failed to close the cases as scheduled also stated their reasons.

In order to continue to strengthen this work, Comrade Ma Wenrui, Deputy Secretary of the CCP Central Committee Northwest Bureau, gave further instructions at the Northwest Bureau's meeting on the work of handling people's letters and visits by the Northwest Region organs on May 8: 1. Leading cadres of all organs and organizations must understand the important significance of the work of handling people's letters and visits, attach sufficient importance to it, strengthen inspection and leadership, and regard it as a regular and important responsibility. For policy-related and important people's letters and visits, leading cadres should personally review or handle them. The main leading organs (such as the General Office of the Northwest Bureau and the General Office of the Northwest Administrative Committee) should hold regular special meetings of various organs and units to handle people's letters, inspect the work situation, summarize experiences, and help various organs solve difficulties in their work. Units and cadres who are serious and responsible in handling people's letters and visits should be commended; organs and cadres who disregard people's letters and visits, delay and accumulate them, and do not handle them seriously must be criticized, and those with serious circumstances should be given necessary disciplinary sanctions by the Party's Discipline Inspection Commission and the People's Supervisory Committee, and announced in the newspapers. 2. Improve the working system for handling people's letters and visits: First, units that do not have a dedicated person in charge should designate qualified cadres from the existing personnel to manage or concurrently manage the work. Second, improve the necessary systems such as receiving, registering, forwarding, urging, reporting back, reviewing, summarizing, and reporting. The主管 (zhuguan) cadres should report the situation to the leadership regularly. Generally, the transfer of letters should not exceed three days. And the deadline for closing the case should be set according to the size and complexity of the problem. Third, relevant organs should set up suggestion boxes in appropriate locations and assign dedicated personnel to be responsible for managing and opening the letters in a timely manner. Fourth, units with reception rooms or inquiry offices must strengthen leadership. Be sure to warmly receive the visiting masses, record the issues discussed, and study and handle them. 3. Letters and visits that report and accuse general cadres can be transferred to the organization where the cadre is located for processing. If the defendant is a responsible cadre, it should be handed over to the higher-level organ for investigation and handling. Do not indiscriminately transfer all cases to the organization where the person concerned is located, let alone directly transfer the accusatory letter to the defendant. 4. When investigating and handling cases, it is necessary to conduct in-depth investigation and research, rely on the masses, find out the facts, analyze them carefully, and handle them correctly. Resolutely oppose the bureaucratic work style of irresponsibly and hastily dealing with matters, oppose starting from impressions, subjective conjecture, or listening to one side of the story, or mixing in personal elements. 5. For major problems that are complicated, serious in nature, and accumulated, the leading organs should organize relevant units to conduct inspections in the near future, and typical cases should be handled seriously in a big way. If there are circumstances of covering up, concealing errors, and making false reports to higher authorities, the personnel concerned should be subject to disciplinary action. Strikers and retaliators must be dealt with strictly. 6. After the problem is investigated and resolved, the accuser and the appellant should be answered in writing or orally. If the person still has objections, it should be reconsidered. If it is indeed handled improperly, it should be restudied and handled. Those who reflect the true situation and resolutely fight against bad people and bad deeds should be supported and commended; those whose reports are inconsistent with the facts should be clarified to the person. 7. Each organ should, according to the size and urgency of the problem, sort the accumulated cases that have been inspected, and solve them quickly in a planned way.

Since May, the Xi'an Masses Daily has also published articles on people's letters and self-criticisms from several organs in the Northwest Region with considerable space, and on May 8, it prominently exposed the news that Zhu Maoqing, Director of the Xi'an Municipal Bureau of Culture and Education, was punished by Party discipline for treating people's letters with a bureaucratic attitude, causing 1,154 people's letters to be accumulated for as long as a year (the vast majority of which were shelved untouched). These have played a certain role in the future work of handling people's letters in the Northwest Region.

    西北区级各机关检查处理人民来信工作
    西北区各机关自今年二月反官僚主义斗争开始后，均按照中央指示精神，对处理人民来信、来访工作进行了一次检查。西北行政委员会办公厅召开了所属机关的汇报会议。中共中央西北局纪律检查委员会、西北人民监察委员会都在今年三月分别召开过两次有关处理人民来信的会议。五月八日，中共中央西北局又召集西北区一级党、政机关、工矿企业、卫生部门、群众团体等四十八个单位，专门开了处理人民来信、来访工作会议。会上，中共中央西北局副书记马文瑞同志作了报告，并确定了西北区各机关进行重点深入检查和处理问题的步骤和办法。
    从这次检查的结果看，西北区各机关自去年“三反”运动后，对于处理人民来信工作一般地都有了改进，许多机关对这一工作都已开始重视，指定专人负责，建立和健全了收发、登记、转办、催办、回报、总结、报告等制度，有的还制订了处理人民来信工作细则，并规定负责干部亲自批阅重要信件。如最高人民法院西北分院司法行政处，对于政策性的问题解答非常认真，有时一稿经过几次修改，拟稿人或核稿的领导干部，对一个重要问题的解答，都翻阅参考书和有关文件，寻找理论上、法律上的根据，进行反复研究；有时还召开有关干部会议，集体讨论。
    由于各机关对人民来信逐渐重视，群众对党和人民政府的信任提高了，来信也逐渐增多了。据中共中央西北局办公厅、西北局纪律检查委员会、西北行政委员会、西北人民监察委员会统计：一九五二年共收到人民来信四千四百四十二件（“三反”运动中的检举信未包括在内），比一九五一年增加二千一百五十九件，反映的问题包括很多方面。尤其是今年反对官僚主义、命令主义和违法乱纪的斗争开始后，各地揭发和处理了一些坏人坏事，鼓舞和支持了广大人民群众向违法乱纪分子和官僚主义分子作斗争的勇气，人民来信更显著增加。西北局办公厅今年四月份的来信比一九五二年每月平均来信数增加了四倍。这些人民来信中所反映的事件，绝大部分是真实的，内容极为丰富，使领导机关发现了许多问题。如西北行政委员会办公厅一九五二年转交各地查办已经报结的五十五件群众控告干部的来信，全部是事实。陕西兴平县大堡子村群众反映该村普通小学乱搞“三反”运动，提出“反盗窃、反逃学旷课、反打人骂人”的口号，用斗争的方式强迫学生在大会上坦白，造成学校混乱，对群众影响很坏。经西北教育局转陕西省文教厅查处并通报各地后，对纠正当时许多学校中的混乱现象起了很大作用。再如一九五二年一月西北公安部干部史汉杰反映他的母亲在西北医学院附设医院眼科治病，因处理不当，致使动手术后引起右眼合并等症状。经西北卫生局协同西安市人民法院调查了解后，证明确有不当之处，即召开西安市各大医院的眼科医师会议讨论研究，纠正了西北医学院附设医院眼科的不负责任作风，并教育了医务人员。
    西北区各机关处理人民来信工作虽有改进，但检查中也暴露出不少缺点和严重问题。具体表现在：
    一、许多机关对处理人民来信工作缺乏检查和领导，有的甚至不闻不问。领导干部亲自批办人民来信和接见人民来访的还是不多。有些干部认为处理人民来信、来访工作“前途不大”，有的把群众意见看成是“找麻烦”，“为了个人利益”等等；因而采取应付态度，对人民来信不细心研究，简单地照抄照转，推出门了事，不催不动，甚至催也不动。有些直接承办单位对收到的信件不及时查办，形成严重积压现象。据西北行政委员会各部门的不完全统计，一九五二年转下去的来信有一千零三十九件没有报结，占全年来信的百分之四十。在工矿企业中，忽视职工意见也相当严重。如玉门油矿在去年四月前后就积压职工合理化建议一千余条。
    二、制度不健全，专职干部太少，兼职干部的责任不明确。不少机关在这次反对官僚主义斗争开始前，连收发、登记制度都没有，有的和一般公文混同起来，一九五二年究竟收到多少人民来信，如何处理，都无法查清。设立意见箱也不普遍，有些还是形式。如人民银行西北区行最近检查意见箱时，发现有一封信已放了半年多。原西北财政部的意见箱内，也积压了四十二件群众来信。很多机关没有定期的检查、总结、报告制度，缺乏统一管理，处于混乱状态。各单位之间也缺乏联系，有的相互推诿，使群众跑来跑去，问题得不到解决。
    三、个别机关不但不认真处理人民来信，反而隐瞒真象，向上级作假报告。如西北农学院在去年八月为了成立机耕实习农场，擅自决定收回出租给附近六个村子一百三十七户农民的一千一百余亩土地，并强迫农民在租账上盖指印，农民非常不满，曾三次给毛主席写信。但当西北局将群众来信转去要该院负责处理时，该院还认为事情的发生是“少数农民思想没搞通”，仅派出工作组去进行了一次“说服”，宣布了一下劳动力多的可被吸收当农场工人，就向西北局报告“问题业已解决”。事实上农民的问题并没有解决。而且工作组干部中还有威胁和辱骂农民的现象，更引起农民不满。直到今年西北局派去工作组，问题才适当解决。这些事实，都说明了有些机关干部还存在着严重的官僚主义作风，缺乏群众观点，不了解处理人民来信的重要意义和对党负责与对人民负责的一致性。
    经过这次检查，干部的认识均有显著提高，对处理人民来信一般都采取了比较认真负责态度，处理速度也有提高。据西北局纪律检查委员会、西北人民监察委员会的检查：自三月二十日召开会议后，多数单位都能认真进行这一工作。西北局纪律检查委员会限期三月底报结的十件案件，如期报结了七件。西北人民监察委员会限期报结的一百九十一件案件，已报结八十件；其中，从三月二十日到月底全部报结的有十个单位，三十七件；报结一半以上的有七个单位；未能如期报结的也声明了理由。
    为了继续加强这一工作，中共中央西北局副书记马文瑞同志在五月八日西北局召开的西北区各机关处理人民来信、来访工作会议上再度作了指示：一、各机关、团体领导干部，必须了解处理人民来信、来访的工作的重要意义，予以足够的重视，加强检查、领导，并作为自己经常的一项重要责任。对于带有政策性的及重要的人民来信、来访，领导干部应亲自批办或亲自处理。各主要领导机关（如西北局办公厅、西北行政委员会办公厅），应定期召开各机关各单位处理人民来信的专门会议，检查工作情况，总结经验，并帮助各机关解决工作中的困难。对于认真负责处理人民来信、来访工作的单位和干部，应予表扬；对于漠视人民来信、来访，拖延积压、不认真办理的机关和干部，必须予以批评，情节严重者，由党的纪律检查委员会及人民监察委员会给以必要的处分，并在报纸上公布。二、健全处理人民来信来访的工作制度：第一、凡没有专人负责的单位，应在现有人员内指定称职干部专管或兼管。第二、健全收发、登记、转办、催办、回报、审核、总结、报告等必要的制度。主管干部要定期向领导上汇报情况。凡转办信件，一般不得超过三天。并应根据问题大小、复杂程度，限期报结。第三、有关的机关应在适当地点设置意见箱，并指定专人负责管理，及时开取信件。第四、凡设有接待室或问事处的单位，必须加强领导。对来访群众一定要热情接待，所谈问题要作记录和研究处理。三、对于检举、控告一般干部的来信、来访，可转交该干部的所在机关组织处理。如被告人为负责干部，则交上一级机关查处。不得无分别地统交当事人所在机关组织处理，更不能将控告信直接转交给被告人。四、查处案件时，必须进行深入的调查研究，依靠群众，查清事实情况，缜密分析，正确处理，不要轻易下结论。坚决反对不负责任草率从事的官僚主义作风，反对从印象出发、主观臆断、或偏听一面之词，或掺杂个人成份。五、对于积压的情况复杂、性质严重的重大问题，应在最近期间由各领导机关组织有关单位进行检查，典型案件应大张旗鼓地严肃处理。如有包庇、隐瞒错误及给上级作假报告的情事，有关人员应受到纪律处分。对打击、报复分子必须严格处理。六、问题查清处理后，应书面或口头答复控告人和申诉人。如本人仍有意见时，应重加考虑。确实处理不当者，应重新研究处理。对反映真实情况，坚决与坏人坏事作斗争的群众或干部，应予支持表扬；与事实有出入者，应向本人讲明。七、各机关对于检查出的积压案件，应按问题大小、缓急，进行案件排队，有计划地迅速解决。
    西安群众日报五月份以来，也以相当篇幅登载了有关人民来信的文章和西北区若干机关的检讨，并在五月八日以显著地位揭发了西安市文教局局长朱茂青以官僚主义态度对待人民来信，使一千一百五十四件人民来信积压达一年之久（其中绝大部分竟原封不动地搁置起来），因而受到党纪处分的消息等。这些都对西北地区今后处理人民来信工作起了一定作用。
