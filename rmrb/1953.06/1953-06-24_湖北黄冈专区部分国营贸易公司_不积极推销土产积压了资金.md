Some state-owned trading departments in Huanggang Prefecture, Hubei Province, do not care about the interests of the masses and fail to actively promote farmers' local products, which has seriously affected farmers' production and tied up a large amount of capital. For example, Qichun County recently experienced a drought, and farmers urgently needed to sell accumulated local products such as sugar, tobacco, lotus root flour, and raw materials for straw hats, but the state-owned stores in the county adopted a passive attitude towards promoting local products. This spring, the county's state-owned stores invested only 9.9 million yuan in local products, a decrease of 43 percent compared with the spring of last year. From January to April this year, the funds invested in local products also decreased month by month. It is estimated that February decreased by 38 percent compared with January, March decreased by 14 percent compared with February, and the first and middle ten days of April decreased by 12 percent compared with the same period in March, resulting in a large number of farmers' local products being unable to be sold. For example, in the four districts of Baishui, Tanlin, etc. in the county, the stock of raw materials for straw hats in the hands of farmers reached about 100,000, and they have not been processed due to lack of purchasers. These currently are fast-selling local products, but have become waste products because the state-owned trading companies do not actively organize sales, which seriously affects local production and disaster relief work.

More seriously, some cadres in state-owned trading departments mistakenly believe that local products are slow-moving and that purchasing local products does not conform to the principle of economic accounting. Therefore, they would rather tie up capital than purchase them. Some even adopt the strategy of "snapping up popular items and pushing unpopular ones." For example, the Huanggang Tobacco and Hemp Company only purchases locally produced tobacco leaves but not locally produced hemp, while the Guangji Tobacco and Hemp Company only purchases locally produced hemp but not locally produced tobacco leaves. As a result, a large amount of capital is tied up. According to statistics from state-owned trading departments in the entire prefecture in late April, bank loans of 11.8 billion yuan and 4 billion yuan deposited in banks were "sleeping" in the banks. The one-sided economic accounting thinking of these state-owned trading departments should be corrected immediately.

    湖北黄冈专区部分国营贸易公司
    不积极推销土产积压了资金
    湖北省黄冈专区部分国营贸易部门不关心群众利益，不积极推销农民的土产品，严重影响了农民的生产，并积压了大批资金。如蕲春县最近发生旱灾，农民急需出售积存的糖、烟、藕粉、草帽原料等土产，但该县国营商店对推销土产采取了消极态度。今年春季，该县国营商店投放在土产方面的资金只有九千九百多万元，比去年春季减少了百分之四十三；从今年一月份到四月份，对土产投放的资金也逐月下降，计今年二月份比一月份下降百分之三十八，三月份比二月份下降百分之十四，四月份上、中旬比三月份同期又下降了百分之十二，致使农民大批土产推销不出去。如该县白水、谭林等四个区，农民手中积存草帽原料一项即达十万顶左右，因无人收购，尚未加工，这些目前正是畅销的土产品，就因国营贸易公司不积极组织推销而变成废品，严重影响了当地的生产救灾工作。
    更严重的是，有些国营贸易部门的干部错误地认为土产是滞销品，收购土产不符合经济核算的原则，因此宁肯积压资金也不愿收购；有的即使收购，也是“抢热推冷”，如黄冈烟麻公司只收购当地出产的烟叶而不收购当地出产的麻，广济烟麻公司只收购当地出产的麻而不收购当地出产的烟叶。结果，大量资金被积压。据全专区国营贸易部门四月下旬的统计，银行贷款一百一十八亿元及存在银行的四十亿元都在银行里“睡觉”。这些国营贸易部门的片面的经济核算思想应即纠正。
