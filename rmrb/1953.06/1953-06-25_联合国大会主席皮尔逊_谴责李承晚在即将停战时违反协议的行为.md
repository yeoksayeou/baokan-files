Xinhua News Agency, June 24th: New York dispatch: United Nations General Assembly President Pearson wrote a letter to Syngman Rhee on the 22nd, condemning his actions of "releasing" prisoners of war and violating the agreement.

Pearson's letter stated: "As President of the United Nations General Assembly, I was shocked to hear that you have approved unilateral action to release non-repatriated North Korean prisoners of war from United Nations Command prisoner-of-war camps in Korea."

The letter stated: The action taken by Syngman Rhee is "extremely regrettable." "Since the armistice negotiations at Panmunjom have made progress... this action of releasing North Korean prisoners of war from United Nations Command prisoner-of-war camps is particularly shocking."

The letter stated: The action of releasing North Korean prisoners of war taken with Syngman Rhee's consent violates the agreement reached by both parties on June 8, 1953, "and this happened just as the war is about to end, and when the issue of a unified Korea and other related Korean issues can be handled by a political conference including all relevant parties."

The letter stated: "In July 1950... you were responsible for promising to hand over the 'command' of the South Korean army, navy, and air force to the United Nations Command. Your above actions violate this responsibility.

"As President of the United Nations General Assembly, I believe it is my responsibility to bring the seriousness of this situation to your attention. I hope and believe that you will cooperate with the United Nations Command so that it can continue and resolutely strive for an early and glorious armistice."

    联合国大会主席皮尔逊
    谴责李承晚在即将停战时违反协议的行为
    【新华社二十四日讯】纽约消息：联合国大会主席皮尔逊在二十二日写信给李承晚，谴责他“释放”战俘、违反协议的行为。
    皮尔逊的信件说：“作为联合国大会主席，我听到你已批准片面行动，把非遣返的北朝鲜战俘从朝鲜联合国军战俘营释放的时候，我感到十分震惊。”
    信件说：李承晚采取的行动，是“极其令人遗憾的”。“由于在板门店的停战谈判已获得进展……因此，这种从朝鲜联合国军战俘营释放北朝鲜战俘的行动更是特别令人震惊。”
    信件说：在李承晚同意之下采取的释放北朝鲜战俘的行动，违犯了双方在一九五三年六月八日所达成的协议，“而这件事正好发生在战争即将停止的时候，在统一朝鲜的问题及其他有关的朝鲜问题都可以由包括有关各方面的政治会议来加以处理的时候”。
    信件说：“一九五零年七月间，……你负责答应把韩国陆海空军的‘指挥权’交给联合国军司令部。你上述的行动违背了这个责任。
    “作为联合国大会主席，我认为我有责任提请你注意这种情况的严重性。我希望并相信你将与联合国军司令部合作，使它能继续并坚决地努力求得早日实现光荣的停战。”
