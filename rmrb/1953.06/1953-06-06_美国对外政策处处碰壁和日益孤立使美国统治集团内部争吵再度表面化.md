Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 5th: American foreign policy's repeated setbacks and growing isolation have brought internal disputes within the American ruling group to the surface again, as evidenced by a recent foreign policy speech by influential Republican Senator Taft.

    In his speech on May 26th, Taft advocated that the United States simply "forget the United Nations" in the East, "expressed doubts" about the feasibility of the U.S. government's North Atlantic military alliance policy, and believed that the United States should not attempt to wage wars with its own troops on the Eurasian continent. In explaining these arguments, he revealed that he had completely lost confidence in current U.S. policy. He complained that the United Nations had ceased to be an "effective tool" in the hands of the United States and worried that the majority the United States has hitherto manipulated in the UN General Assembly would "turn against" the United States. He said that he did not advocate using American troops on the Asian continent, "for the simple reason...that our numbers are too small in comparison." He also did not believe that the United States' strength "could effectively defend Europe." He added that to maintain a "general policy of a worldwide front against Communism, there is another difficulty," namely, obtaining "genuine sympathetic support in this regard from our allies." He pointed out that Britain, France, etc., are "very eager to reconcile with Russia and restore trade as much as possible, which means...the entire anti-Russian military alliance is weak." He pointed out that although the United States has invested tens of billions of dollars in "maintaining this worldwide alliance against the Soviet Union," he hoped that this work could be carried out, but he doubted whether it could last long.

    Taft's speech received open support from some Republican members of the U.S. Congress, such as Representative Burdick, Senator McCarran, and Representative Gross. The opinions expressed by these members reflected the annoyance felt by the American ruling group at the setbacks and growing isolation of the United States in diplomacy. Burdick agreed that the United States should no longer care about its Western European "allies," saying, "That way, we don't have to spend money to maintain the facade for the rapidly declining British Empire."

    Other important Republican senators, such as Senator Smith and Senator Ferguson of the Foreign Relations Committee, declined to express their agreement or disagreement with Taft's views.

    On May 28th, when answering questions at a press conference, Eisenhower admitted that Taft's speech reflected an unpleasant mood in American diplomacy, but he said that Taft's proposed approach of "going it alone" was actually unworkable because the United States really could not go it alone. Although Eisenhower tried to downplay the seriousness of the internal disputes within the American ruling group revealed by Taft's speech in his remarks, he admitted that differences did exist.

    Eisenhower's views received support from another faction within the American ruling group. Acheson, President of the American Association for the United Nations, refuted Taft's "going it alone" argument, saying that it would only "bring major disasters." He pointed out that the United States was relying on the United Nations to find "moral and legal" cover for its actions in Korea, without which "many countries would consider it imperialist intervention." Democratic Senator Green pointed out that Taft's approach would only "divide the United States from its allies." Columnist Lippmann said Taft's views were a "dangerous mistake" because, he said, if the United States lost its "Western allies," its strategic air force would lose its effectiveness.

    However, another columnist, Lawrence, and "The Wall Street Journal" blamed Eisenhower for making hasty comments without having studied the full meaning of Taft's speech.

    This public disagreement among the leading figures of the American ruling group is actually a development of the public dispute that took place more than two years ago, and due to Taft's current position, this disagreement has a more profound significance. Back then, Taft was attacking the Truman administration as the leader of the "opposition party," placing the responsibility for the failures entirely on the ruling Democratic Party. Now, Republican Eisenhower has replaced Democrat Truman as president for more than four months, and Taft himself is the main pillar of this government in Congress. He participates in various important government decisions; as he said in his speech, he has the opportunity to participate in discussions on foreign affairs in the Foreign Relations Committee and in meetings convened by the President with members of Congress, but his current conclusion is still that he "feels the enormous difficulty of all these problems, and now there seems to be no satisfactory solution." His current position gives his words even greater authority.

    Taft's speech has aroused much comment at home and abroad. The West German newspaper "General News" pointed out that since Eisenhower came to power, apart from following Truman's old path, he has not achieved any success, and many Republicans have felt "disappointed." The newspaper said: "Some people accuse Eisenhower of being too close to Truman's policies, and say that Eisenhower has not fundamentally changed the situation in Korea, Taiwan, and elsewhere. Taft has become the spokesman for these people."

    After Eisenhower came to power, he proved equally helpless in the face of the huge pile of problems left by Truman. This is the fundamental reason for the deepening of the disagreements. A dispatch from Agence France-Presse stated: "The problem of foreign aid, the problem of Western European unity, the problem of a Korean armistice, the problem of international trade, and the problem of American Far Eastern policy have brought the struggle that has been going on in secret into the open."

### 美国对外政策处处碰壁和日益孤立使美国统治集团内部争吵再度表面化

    美国对外政策处处碰壁和日益孤立使美国统治集团内部争吵再度表面化
    【新华社五日讯】华盛顿消息，美国有势力的共和党参议员塔夫脱新近发表的外交演说，使得两年多以前曾经爆发过的美国统治集团中关于外交政策的争吵又一次表面化。
    塔夫脱在他五月二十六日发表的那个演说中主张美国在东方干脆“忘掉联合国”，对美国政府的北大西洋军事集团政策的可行性“表示怀疑”，并认为美国不应当企图以自己的军队在欧亚大陆上进行战争。他在解释他的这些主张时透露他对于美国现行政策已完全失掉信心。他抱怨联合国已不能成为美国手中的一个“有效的工具”，并担心美国迄今在联合国大会中操纵的多数会“转而反对”美国。他说他不主张美国在亚洲大陆用兵，“唯一的理由是……我们的人数在对比之下实在是太少了”。他也不认为美国的力量“能够有效地保卫欧洲”。他还说，要维持一个“反对共产主义的世界阵线的总政策还有另外一个困难”，那就是取得“盟国在这方面的真正的同情支持”。他指出英国、法国等等“非常急于与俄国和解并尽量恢复贸易，这意味……整个反俄军事同盟是软弱的”。他指出，虽然美国化成十亿美元于“保持这个世界范围对付苏联的联盟”，他也希望这个工作能够贯彻，但他怀疑这能否保持长久。
    塔夫脱的演说，得到美国国会中一部分共和党议员的公开支持，如众议员伯迪克，参议员麦卡伦，众议员格鲁斯等。这些议员所发表的意见都反映了美国统治集团对于美国在外交上处处碰壁和日益孤立的形势所感到的恼怒。伯迪克赞成美国不再管它西欧的“盟国”，他说：“那样我们就可不必再拿出钱来替很快地衰落下去的大英帝国维持门面了。”
    另外一些重要的共和党议员如参议员外交委员会委员史密斯和福格逊拒绝对塔夫脱的主张表示可否。
    五月二十八日，艾森豪威尔在记者招待会上回答问题时承认，塔夫脱的演说是反映了美国在外交上一种不如意的情绪，但他说塔夫脱提出“单独干”的作法实际上是行不通的，因为美国实在单干不了。虽然艾森豪威尔在谈话中竭力想冲淡塔夫脱的演说所暴露的美国统治集团内部争吵的严重性，但他承认分歧的确存在。
    艾森豪威尔的意见得到美国统治集团中另外一部分势力的支持。美国联合国同志会会长埃契尔堡格反驳塔夫脱的“单独干”的主张说那只会“带来重大的灾害”。他指出，美国正是依靠联合国，才给自己在朝鲜的行径找到“道义上和法律上的”掩饰的，没有这一点，“许多国家就会认为这是帝国主义的干涉”了。民主党参议员格林指出：塔夫脱的作法只会使美国和它的“盟国分裂”。专栏作家李普曼说塔夫脱的意见是“危险的错误”，因为，他说，美国如果失掉它的“西方盟国”，它的战略空军就会失去作用。
    但是另一专栏作家劳伦斯和“华尔街日报”却责怪艾森豪威尔未曾研究塔夫脱的演说的全部意思就冒失地进行评论。
    美国统治集团首脑人物之间这次公开的意见分歧实际上是两年多前那次公开化的争吵的发展，由于塔夫脱现在的地位，这次分歧具有了更深刻的意义。当年，塔夫脱是以“在野党”领袖的身分攻击杜鲁门政府，把失败的责任完全推在执政的民主党头上。现在，共和党的艾森豪威尔已代替民主党的杜鲁门执政四个多月，而塔夫脱自己是这个政府在国会里的主要靠山，他参与政府的各种重要决策；如他在演说中所说，他有机会参加外交委员会和总统所召开的、与国会议员间的会议关于外交问题的讨论，但是他现在的结论仍是“感到所有这些问题的巨大困难，并且现在似乎决没有一种令人满意的解决办法”。他目前的地位使他这句话具有更权威的意义。
    塔夫脱的演说发表后引起了美国国内外许多评论。西德的“一般新闻”指出，由于艾森豪威尔上台以后，除了遵循杜鲁门的老路，并无任何成绩，很多共和党人已感到“失望”。该报说：“有些人指责艾森豪威尔太接近于杜鲁门的政策，并说艾森豪威尔根本没有改变朝鲜、台湾和别处的局势，塔夫脱成为这些人的发言人了。”
    艾森豪威尔上台之后，在杜鲁门留下来的一大堆问题面前，证明同样是束手无策。这就是分歧的深刻化的根本原因。法新社的一则消息这样说：“援外问题、西欧国家团结问题、朝鲜停战问题、国际贸易问题、美国远东政策问题使一直秘密在进行的斗争公开了。”
