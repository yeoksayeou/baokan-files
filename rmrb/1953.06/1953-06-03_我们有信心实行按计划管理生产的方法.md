    We Are Confident in Implementing Planned Production Management Methods
    Wang Wenshan, Labor Model of Shenyang City, Director of Workshop Two, Northeast Machinery Factory No. 1

    I am a workshop director promoted from among the workers, and in the past, I didn’t understand how to implement planned management in a workshop. My comrades in the workshop and I learned what planned management is and how to improve it after studying the People's Daily editorial "Establishing Planned Management on the Basis of Discussing Plans." This editorial pointed out some shortcomings in current enterprises, and pointed out that in order to overcome these shortcomings, we must first improve planned management in a planned and step-by-step manner (such as work plans, quotas, original records, etc.) and establish various responsibility systems (such as administrative specialized responsibility system, technical responsibility system, technical supply responsibility system, etc.). To achieve this goal, based on current conditions, when formulating work plans, we should first study the state's planned tasks, conduct various balancing work, and correctly calculate production capacity, rationally organize labor, and carefully analyze original records, etc. This editorial pointed out the path to planned management for us.

    We realized that to strengthen planned management, we must first have correct quotas. Correct quotas are based on correct original records, so we decided to start with rectifying original records. We examined the original records of the past and found many problems. In the past, our original records were like this: "estimated recording" at the beginning, because production was not standardized at that time, various management systems had not been established or were not sound, and no piecework wage or bonus systems had been implemented, so the product man-hours were recorded high or low, which had no impact on workers' wages. When the recorder asked the workers how many man-hours this work took, the workers sometimes didn't bother to answer, and the recorder, in order to cope with the errand, casually "estimated" and recorded it. After the implementation of the bonus wage system, because workers could not get bonuses without the recorder recording their work, the recorder was not in a hurry to ask the workers, but waited for the workers to report. The recorder recorded whatever the workers reported. This kind of "reporting and recording" was certainly not very accurate. Later, our factory's production became standardized, and a piecework wage system was implemented. In order to avoid workers falsely reporting records and to implement economic accounting, the leading comrades pointed out that it was not enough for the recorders to stay in the office; they had to go to the work teams. After this, there was some progress in calculating intermittent working hours, but it was still unclear how much time it took to make a product. Many workers were unwilling to report the actual working hours for completing products. In this way, of course, we could not grasp the laws of production based on the original records. Especially when producing new products, the quotas for various product components were different. Therefore, the plan was sometimes tight and sometimes loose, affecting balanced production.

    Why was the original record work not done well? The main reason is that we did not attach importance to this work in the past, and we did not know the importance of original record work. Recently, we implemented the Soviet experience of hourly production progress and mobilized the masses to improve original record work. We set up a "hourly progress indicator board" on each machine tool, on which the production plan was written. Workers wrote down their progress in completing the plan every hour, and the recorder inspected each machine tool every hour, copied the information filled in by the workers onto the record sheet, and supervised and educated the workers to fill in the true situation. In improving the record system, we also linked it to the wage issue. Because in the past, piecework was calculated on a per-machine basis, and two or three people worked on a lathe in shifts, and the wages they earned were divided equally. Some wage distributions based on technical grade were also unreasonable, and some young workers often did more work than the old technicians but received less pay. Therefore, every time wages were paid, some people were always emotional, and production was not very good. Another drawback of piecework by machine tool is that when defective products are produced, it is impossible to determine who is responsible, and the workers do not strive to improve their skills. This time, we changed to individual piecework according to the principle of more work, more pay, and less work, less pay. Whoever produces defective products has their wages deducted. Because the interests of the state are combined with the interests of the individual, the workers' enthusiasm for production has been greatly improved. For example, the production efficiency of the spindle has increased three times, and the scrap rate of the headstock has decreased by thirty-two percent. Moreover, doing so can also gradually make the records accurate, laying the foundation for formulating various quotas and implementing planned management.

    In rectifying the original records, it was revealed that the responsibilities of workshop management personnel were unclear. For example, the responsibility of the execution group should be to check and supervise the completion of production tasks, report production to the workshop director and factory director, and understand the tasks for the next month and the material preparation situation in the warehouse, but our execution group did not play this role, but mainly went to negotiate some technical issues with tools and fixtures. The responsibilities of the section chiefs, engineers, and others were also unclear. The section chief was trapped in the affairs all day long and had little time to consider improving production management. I was also busy to death all day long, going wherever I was needed. I could not often grasp the key issues and solve them. I worked very hard, but production was not good. We held a Party branch meeting to study this issue and decided to establish a management responsibility system. Then, we held a workshop management personnel meeting to explain the importance of establishing a management responsibility system to the management personnel and led them to study this issue. They exposed the phenomenon of no one being responsible for workshop management, analyzed the reasons, and finally clarified the scope of responsibilities. Now, the statistics group is responsible for analyzing and calculating the average advanced quota based on the original records and statistics; the execution group is responsible for supervising and checking the implementation of the work plan and notifying the planning group in advance about the material preparation situation in the warehouse; the technical group is responsible for technical supply issues such as tools and fixtures; and the planning group is responsible for creating work plans. In this way, with correct quotas, knowing the material preparation situation, and someone checking and solving problems in production, the work plan is easier to implement. We also changed the skilled section execution staff to scheduling recorders, specializing in managing production scheduling and one-hour record work, overcoming the shortcomings of the past when recorders did not understand production and asked workers everything, which could not guarantee the accuracy of the original records.

    Now, our workshop is not as chaotic as it used to be, and the cadres and workers have a clear understanding. In the past, our plans were very conservative. It was not that we deliberately wanted to be conservative, but mainly because we did not have a clear understanding in our minds. Take wage evaluation as an example. The factory asked the workshop to nominate the quota, and the workshop asked the section to nominate, and the section distributed it to each group. The group leader did not have a clear understanding in his mind, and felt that the workers in the group were about the same, and did not know who to nominate. So, almost all the people in the group were nominated to the section. The section chief reduced some according to the proportion and nominated them to the workshop. The list sent by the section exceeded the quota, and the workshop director had no choice but to convene a meeting of section chiefs and group leaders to study. At the meeting, each group said that their group was good, and there was no result after a few days of arguing. The workshop director had no choice but to decide casually. In this way, errors were inevitable. Therefore, when the list of wage increases was announced, the workers came to the workshop director, some asking why their wages could not be increased; others said that if their wages could not be increased this time, then the director should point out their shortcomings as a goal for struggle. The workshop director was "checkmated" and had no way out. Okay, let's talk at length and "get through their thinking." To be honest, workshop cadres are most afraid of evaluating wages and bonuses. This is mainly because they do not have a clear understanding in their minds.

    Our strengthening of planned management is only the beginning, and there are still many problems in production, such as the coordination between various departments is not good enough. However, we have finally learned from our work where to start strengthening planned management. We are now preparing to learn from the scheduling system experience of the former Sino-Soviet Changchun Railway, so as to achieve one scheduling per day, so as to make a shift plan in one day, and strengthen the guiding role of the plan. We are confident in gradually achieving planned production management.

    我们有信心实行按计划管理生产的方法
    沈阳市劳动模范  东北机械一厂二车间主任  王文山
    我是从工人中提拔起来的车间主任，过去不懂得怎样在一个车间实行计划管理。我和车间的同志们，是学习人民日报“在讨论计划的基础上建立计划管理”的社论以后，才知道什么是计划管理和怎样改善计划管理的。这篇社论指出了现在企业中的一些缺点，指出要想克服这些缺点，首先要有计划地、有步骤地改善计划管理（如作业计划、定额、原始记录等），建立各种责任制（如行政专责制、技术责任制、技术供应责任制等）。要达到这个目的，根据现在条件，在制订作业计划时，应首先研究国家的计划任务，进行各种平衡工作和正确计算生产能力，合理组织劳动力，详细分析原始记录等。这篇社论给我们指出了到达计划管理的道路。
    我们认识了要加强计划管理得先有正确定额。正确的定额是以正确的原始记录作根据的，所以我们决定先从整顿原始记录开始。我们检查过去的原始记录，发现有许多毛病。在过去，我们的原始记录是这样的：开始时“估录”，因为那时候生产不正规，各种管理制度还没有建立或者不健全，也没实行超额奖励制度和计件工资，所以产品工时记得高或低，对工人工资没有影响。记录员去问工人这个活做多少工时，工人有时都不爱答理，记录员为应付差事，就随便“估”一下就记上了。开始实行超额奖励的工资制度以后，因为工人做出活来不经过记录员记账就得不到超额奖，所以记录员也不着急去问工人，而等着工人来报。工人报多少记录员就记多少。这种“报录”当然不是很准确的。后来，我们厂里的生产正规了，实行计件工资制了。为了避免工人虚报记录，以便实行经济核算制，领导同志指出记录员只呆在屋里是不行的，必须到小组去。这以后，在计算间断工时方面有些进步，但是做一件什么样产品得多少时间还是记不清。很多工人都不愿报真实完成产品的工时，这样，当然不能根据原始记录来掌握生产规律，特别是生产新产品时，各种产品部件的定额高低不一样。因此，计划也是一会紧一会松的，影响均衡生产。
    原始记录工作为什么做得不好呢？主要是我们过去在思想上没有重视这个工作，不知道原始记录工作的重要。最近，我们实行苏联按小时进度生产的经验，发动群众改进原始记录工作。我们在每个机床上设立一块“时进度指示板”，上面写上生产计划，工人按小时写上自己完成计划的情况，记录员每小时到各机床巡视一次，把工人填写的情况抄在记录表上，并且监督和教育工人填写真实情况。在改善记录制度时，又联系到了工资问题。因为过去是以机床为单位计件的，两个人或三个人在一台车床上倒班干活，得的工资都是平均分。有些按技术等级分工资的也不合理，往往有些青工比老技工干的还多但工资却拿得少。所以，每逢发工资时，总有一些人闹情绪，生产不太好。按机床计件还有一个缺点，就是出了废品分不出是谁的责任，工友们也不努力钻研技术。这次我们按多干多得、少干少得的原则，改为个人计件，谁出了废品扣谁的工资。由于把国家利益和个人利益结合起来了，工人的生产积极性就大大地提高了。如主轴的生产效率提高了三倍，床头箱废品率降低了百分之三十二。并且，这样做还可使记录逐渐走向准确，为制订各种定额，实行计划管理打下了基础。
    在整顿原始记录中暴露了车间管理人员职责不明。如执令组的责任应该是检查督促完成生产任务，向车间主任、厂长报告生产情况，了解下月任务和仓库备料情况，但是我们的执令组没有起到这个作用，而主要是经常去交涉工具、卡具技术上的一些事情。工段长、工程师等责任范围也不清，工段长整天陷在事务坑里，很少有时间去考虑改进生产管理。我也是一天忙的要命，哪儿找上哪儿去，不能经常抓住关键问题，并加以解决，挺辛苦，但生产搞不好。我们开了党支部会议，研究这个问题，决定建立管理责任制。接着，我们召开了车间管理人员会议，对管理人员说明建立管理责任制的重要，并领导他们研究这个问题。他们揭发了车间管理方面的无人负责现象，分析其原因，最后划清了职责范围。现在，统计组负责按原始记录分析、统计平均先进定额；执令组负责督促、检查作业计划的实现和事先通知计划组关于仓库备料情况；技术组负责工具、卡具等技术供应问题；计划组负责编造作业计划。这样，有了正确定额，知道了材料准备情况，有人检查和解决生产中的问题，作业计划也就好实现了。我们还把有技术的工段执令员，改为调度记录员，专门掌管生产调度和一小时记录工作，克服了过去记录员因不懂生产什么都问工人，不能保证原始记录的准确的缺点。
    现在，我们车间不像过去那样忙乱了，干部和工人心里有数了。过去我们的计划订得很保守，倒不是我们故意要保守，主要是由于心中没有数。拿评工资来说吧，厂里叫车间提名额，车间就叫工段提，工段就分配给各小组，小组长心里也没有数，觉得小组里工人都差不多，不知提谁好，所以一提就差不多全小组的人都提到工段来；工段长按比例减少一些又提到车间。工段送来的名单超过了定额，车间主任没有办法，就召集工段长、小组长开会研究。会上，每一小组都说自己的小组好，闹几天也没有个结果。车间主任没办法，就随便决定了。这样，当然难免出错。因此，当提高工资的名单公布后，工人都来找车间主任了，有的人问为什么他的工资不能提高；有的说这次我的工资不能提高，那么，你给提一提缺点吧，好作为奋斗目标。车间主任被“将军”得连一点办法也没有，好，说长说短，“打通思想”吧。说实在话，车间干部最怕评工资和评奖。这主要是心中没有数的原故。
    我们加强计划管理还只是开头，生产上还存在着好多问题，如各个部门配合得还不够好。但是，我们终于从工作中认识了加强计划管理应从哪里下手了。我们现在准备学习以前中长铁路的调度制度经验，以便作到一天一调度，作到一天就能作出班计划，加强计划的指导作用。我们有信心逐步地作到计划管理生产。
