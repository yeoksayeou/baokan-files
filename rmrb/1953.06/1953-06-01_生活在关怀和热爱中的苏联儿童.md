    Soviet Children Living in Care and Love
    Li He
    I remember once, I was a guest at the home of Comrade Borisov, chairman of the Zhdanov Collective Farm in the Istrinsky District of Moscow Oblast. Borisov had six children at the time, and he stroked the hair of his toddler daughter and said to me, "When I see children, I forget the fatigue of the day. Isn't everything we do for the happiness of future generations?"
    The same words can be heard everywhere in the Soviet Union. In the Soviet Union, the many places I have been and the many people I have visited have given me a strong feeling that the Soviet people all share one thought: children are the future, hope, and happiness of mankind. This idea of the Soviet people is inseparably linked with their ideal of building communism. Therefore, in the Soviet Union, you can see people's meticulous care for children everywhere, and you can feel that Soviet children are the happiest in the world everywhere.
    I met many "Heroic Mothers" in the rural areas of Azerbaijan who had more than ten children. These mothers with many children enjoy great glory and live very happily. They are not only able to give birth safely, but also able to raise their children educationally, partly because of the superior living conditions in socialist society, and partly because of the state's respect and care for them. The Soviet government provides billions of rubles in subsidies to mothers with many children and single mothers every year.
    I have been to nurseries and kindergartens in Soviet factories and collective farms, and to Soviet primary and secondary schools. There are comfortable houses and perfect facilities there, and what I envy most is the large number and education of the childcare staff. There is often one childcare worker for every few children in the nursery, and an average of one secondary school graduate teacher for every thirty children in the primary school. This is a touching figure. In Soviet factories and collective farms, people are making every effort to improve mechanization and save labor, but they are so willing to spend manpower in raising children. This shows that in socialist society, people, children, are the most precious things.
    I visited the Moscow "Young Pioneer Palace," the Tbilisi "Children's Railway Station," and other children's extracurricular activity places. What attracted my attention most there was not the children's happy entertainment and organized life, but their activities in developing creativity and talent in games. They are seriously making models of airplanes and ships, driving trains, writing poetry, or painting there. They are the creators of future society—engineers, writers, painters, musicians... In 1923, the Soviet Union established the first "Young Pioneer Palace" in Moscow, and now there are 1,269 Young Pioneer Palaces and "Young Pioneer Houses" throughout the Soviet Union. In addition, the Soviet Union also has 417 Young Technicians' Stations and 231 Young Natural Scientists' Stations. These institutions attract countless young children. For example, in the Moscow "Young Pioneer Palace," more than 200,000 children go to play every year; 3,000 children regularly participate in the activities of its 143 groups, workshops, art rooms, and laboratories; and 600 children participate in its song and dance troupe. In 1935, the Soviet Union built the first children's railway in Tbilisi, and now, twenty-two children's railways have been built successively in Moscow, Leningrad, Kharkov, Minsk, Alma-Ata, Tashkent, and other places. These narrow-gauge railways are very interesting. They are each one and a half to two kilometers long, with railway stations, one to three locomotives, and three to twelve small carriages. The trains are managed by children aged eleven to seventeen, and the passengers are also children. Many young railway workers go to railway schools after they grow up and then work on the railway.
    I also went to the Moscow Children's Bookstore and saw the children's books displayed in various bookstores and libraries. The Soviet Union not only publishes a large number of diverse children's books, but also has many writers who specialize in serving children. According to statistics, the Soviet State Children's Book Publishing House has published 41,000 kinds of children's books, with a total circulation of 1.6 billion copies. One out of every nine books printed by the state is for children. This year, Soviet children will receive 450 new books, totaling 59 million copies. Now, the Soviet Union not only has children's literature writers, but also many famous scientists, such as Lepeshinskaya, are writing for children. In addition, there are 23 children's magazines and 20 children's newspapers published for children throughout the Soviet Union.
    I have also been to children's summer camps and children's theaters and other rest and entertainment places, and saw the Soviet people's concern for the physical and mental health development of children. Children's summer camps are all set up in the most scenic places, welcoming the young generation to spend their holidays happily and healthily every summer. Children generally have the opportunity to go to summer camps. The Soviet government will spend more than 500 million rubles on summer camps this year. This year, 2.75 million children will go to summer camps run by trade unions to rest. There are now 140 children's theaters and puppet theaters throughout the Soviet Union, with 11 million young audiences annually. The Moscow Children's Theater has highly skilled actors performing wonderful and educational dramas for children. Film companies also produce children's films, allowing these builders of future communist society to receive education in entertainment. (Xinhua News Agency) (Attached picture)

    生活在关怀和热爱中的苏联儿童
    李何
    记得有一次，我在莫斯科州伊斯特林区日丹诺夫集体农庄主席波里梭夫同志家里作客。波里梭夫当时有六个孩子，他摩抚着咿呀学语的小女儿的头发对我说：“我看见了小孩就忘记了一天的疲劳。我们的一切不就是为着人类后代的幸福吗？”
    同样的话在苏联到处可以听到。在苏联，我所到过的许多地方和我所访问过的许多人，都给我一个强烈的感觉，那就是苏联人都共有一个思想：儿童就是人类的未来、希望和幸福。苏联人的这种思想是和他们建设共产主义的理想一脉相连的。所以在苏联，随时随地可以看到人们对儿童的无微不至的关怀，随时随地可以感觉到苏联儿童是全世界最幸福的。
    我曾在阿塞拜疆的农村遇见了许多“母亲英雄”，她们有十个以上的孩子。这些多子母亲都享受着很大的光荣，生活得非常愉快和幸福。她们不但能够安全地生育，而且能够有教育地抚养自己的儿女，这一方面是因为社会主义社会生活条件优越，另一方面是由于国家对她们的尊重和照顾。苏联政府每年就给多子母亲和单身母亲们几十亿卢布的补助金。
    我到过苏联的工厂和农庄的托儿所和幼儿园，到过苏联的小学和中学，那里有舒适的房舍，有完善的设备，而最使我羡慕的，是那里的抚教人员的众多和有教养。托儿所里常常是几个儿童有一个保育员，小学校里平均三十个儿童有一个中学毕业的教员。这是令人感动的数字。在苏联工厂、农庄里，人们正不遗余力地努力提高机械化和节省人力，但在抚育儿童方面又这样肯花人力。这说明：在社会主义社会里，人、儿童真是最宝贵的东西。
    我参观过莫斯科的“少年先锋队之家”、第比利斯的“儿童铁路车站”和其他儿童课外活动场所。那里最吸引我注意的不是儿童们的愉快的娱乐和有组织的生活，而是他们在游戏中发展创造性和才能的活动。他们在那里认真地制造着飞机和轮船的模型，驾驶着火车，写诗或绘画。他们就是未来社会的创造者——工程师、作家、画家、音乐家……一九二三年，苏联在莫斯科建立起第一个“少年先锋队之家”，而现在全苏联已有一千二百六十九个少年先锋宫和“少年先锋队之家”了。此外，苏联还有四百一十七个少年技术站和二百三十一个少年自然科学站。这些机构吸引了无数的少年儿童。例如，在莫斯科“少年先锋队之家”，每年去玩的儿童就有二十多万；经常有三千个儿童参加它的一百四十三个小组、工艺室、艺术室、实验室的活动；有六百个儿童参加它的歌舞团。一九三五年，苏联在第比利斯建立了第一条儿童铁路，而现在，在莫斯科、列宁格勒、哈尔科夫、明斯克、阿拉木图、塔什干等地，已经先后建筑了二十二条儿童铁路了。这些窄轨铁道是非常有趣的。它们各长一公里半到两公里，有火车站，有机车一到三辆，小车厢三个到十二个。管理火车的都是十一岁到十七岁的儿童，乘客也是儿童。许多少年铁道工作者长大以后就进铁道学校，然后在铁道上工作。
    我还到过莫斯科儿童书屋，看见过各个书店里、图书馆里摆满着儿童读物。苏联不仅出版大量的多种多样的儿童读物，而且有许多专为儿童服务的作家。据统计，苏联国立儿童书籍出版局已经出版了四万一千种儿童书籍，共印行十六亿册。国家每印刷九册书籍就有一册是给儿童的。今年苏联儿童将得到四百五十种新书，共五千九百万册。现在，苏联不仅有儿童文学作家，而且许多著名的科学家，如列皮辛斯卡雅等人都为儿童写作。此外，全苏联还为儿童出版着二十三种儿童杂志和二十种儿童报纸。
    我也到过儿童夏令营和儿童戏院等休息和娱乐场所，看到了苏联人对于儿童身心健康发展的关怀。儿童夏令营都是设立在风景最优美的地方，每年夏季迎接幼小的一代愉快而健康地消度假日。儿童们普遍得到去夏令营的机会。苏联政府今年将为夏令营支出五亿卢布以上。今年将有二百七十五万儿童到工会办的夏令营去休息。全苏联现在有一百四十个儿童戏院和傀儡戏院，每年有少年观众一千一百万。莫斯科儿童剧院有技艺高超的演员为儿童演出富有教育意义的精彩戏剧。电影公司也出产着儿童片，让这些未来的共产主义社会的建设者们在娱乐中接受教育。（新华社）（附图片）
