Reader's Letters Abstract

    Jiangxi Province, Leping County Seventh District People's Government, Zhan Xinzhong writes: The Construction Section of the Leping County People's Government distributed and promoted three improved rice varieties in our district this spring, namely Nanxin No., Long-grain Indica, and Gannan No., totaling 23,472 jin. They publicized the benefits of improved rice varieties to the masses and explained that these improved varieties were selected by single-panicle selection and bulk selection from the Fourth District of the county (the high-yield area of the entire special district). The masses in our district were very happy, and many farmers traveled more than 60 li to exchange 115 jin of unhusked rice for 100 jin of improved rice seeds. However, when the farmers exchanged for the seeds and took a look, they found that the grains were mixed in size, the colors were uneven, and there were many barnyard grasses. The farmers reflected: "Long-grain Indica is so-so, but the other two varieties are not as good as our ordinary rice. Using this kind of rice as seed is not as good as using our own rice seeds." We had no choice but to mobilize the farmers to carry out grain selection, wind selection, water selection, seed soaking, and other work. As a result, some farmers still used their own rice seeds and ate the improved seeds they had exchanged for at a high price. After sowing, it happened to be continuous spring rain, and it was cold for ten consecutive days, resulting in seedling rot. According to the investigation, the seedling rot was the most serious in the improved varieties. This situation has caused losses to the farmers' production and has created difficulties for the future promotion of improved varieties. The Construction Section of Leping County blindly promoted improved varieties without asking about the quality, resulting in bad consequences. They should conduct a profound self-criticism and examine the seed selection work in the Fourth District of Leping last year.

    江西乐平县人民政府建设科盲目推广品质低劣的“良种”
    江西省乐平县第七区人民政府詹新中来信：乐平县人民政府建设科在今春分配我区推广南新号、长粒籼、赣农三种改良稻种共二万三千四百七十二斤。他们向群众宣传了改良稻种的好处，并说明这些良种是本县四区（全专区丰产区）经单穗选和块选选出的。我区群众很高兴，很多农民跑了六十多里路去用一百十五斤谷换一百斤改良稻种。但是，农民换回种籽一看，却是颗粒大小混杂，色泽红白不一，稗草很多。农民们反映：“长粒籼还马马虎虎，另两种还不如自己的常谷。这种谷做禾种，还没有自己的谷种好。”我们没办法，只得动员农民再进行粒选、风选、水选、浸种等工作。结果，一部分农民仍用自己的谷种，把高价换来的改良种吃了。播种后，恰遇春雨连绵，一连寒冷了十来天，产生了烂秧现象。根据调查，烂秧情况最严重的又是改良种。这种情况，已使农民的生产受到损失，并给今后推广改良品种工作造成了困难。乐平县建设科不问质量，盲目推广改良品种，以致造成恶果。他们应该作深刻检讨，并对乐平四区去年的选种工作进行检查。
