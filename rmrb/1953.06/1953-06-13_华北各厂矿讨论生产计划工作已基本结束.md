    North China Factories and Mines Basically Conclude Production Plan Discussions
    The work of discussing the national production plan in factories and mines in North China has basically concluded by the end of May. Currently, many factories in Tianjin, Tangshan, Shijiazhuang and other places are rectifying original records and formulating work plans to further strengthen plan management; more than 30 factories in Shijiazhuang, Zhangjiakou, Baoding and other places have signed collective contracts or liaison contracts to ensure the realization of the national production plan.
    After this plan discussion, the national plan concept of the workers in many factories and mines has been strengthened. Workers of the Wang Tuni roving group in the fine yarn workshop of the Jinhua Textile Factory in Shanxi Province, realized that the national plan is a guide for the progress of building the motherland, and that an impractical plan is an obstacle to progress. Therefore, when formulating the group plan, they looked for technical tips in many ways to shorten the roving time and reduce yarn breakage. Workers of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant adopted the method of "technical meeting," and organized rotating performances of advanced operating methods to generally improve the technical level and formulate an advanced plan. Many workers understand that without an overall concept, balanced production will be destroyed, so they strengthened the connection between upper and lower processes and departments. After the Shijiazhuang Knitting Factory strengthened the connection between workshop team leaders and receiving and dispatching, it has been able to understand the inventory of semi-finished products in time and maintain normal production progress.
    The situation of completing the national production plan has also been greatly improved. After discussing and revising the plan, eight factories including Beijing North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory and Factory 546 generally began to complete the national plan on a ten-day and monthly basis, changing the past phenomenon of being loose in the front and tight in the back. The workers of the steelmaking department of Tianjin Steel Plant can master the production progress stipulated in the work plan. Everyone knows through calculation that if they fail to complete the production task for one minute, it will bring losses to the country. Beijing Shijingshan Power Plant once inspected the implementation of the plan by 62 groups. As a result, they generally were able to complete the production plan, and ten groups made excellent achievements. (Xinhua News Agency)

### 华北各厂矿讨论生产计划工作已基本结束

    华北各厂矿讨论生产计划工作已基本结束
    华北各工厂、矿山讨论国家生产计划的工作已在五月底基本结束。目前天津、唐山、石家庄等地不少工厂在整顿原始记录，制订作业计划，以进一步加强计划管理；石家庄、张家口、保定等地有三十多个工厂签订了集体合同或联系合同，以保证国家生产计划的实现。
    经过这次讨论计划以后，许多工厂、矿山的职工都加强了国家计划观念。山西省晋华纺织厂细纱间王兔妮落纱小组工人，认识到国家计划是建设祖国前进的指路标，计划不切实际就是前进的障碍。因此，他们在制订小组计划时，多方面寻找技术窍门，缩短落纱时间和减少断纱。太原钢铁厂职工采取“技术会师”的办法，有组织地轮流表演先进操作法，普遍提高技术水平，制订了先进的计划。许多职工懂得了没有整体观念，就会破坏均衡的生产，因而加强了上下工序和部门之间的联系。石家庄针织厂加强了车间小组长和收发之间的联系后，已能及时了解半成品的存量，保持了正常的生产进度。
    完成国家生产计划的情况也有了很大改善。北京市华北农业机械总厂、五四六工厂等八个工厂在讨论修订计划后，一般都开始作到按旬按月的完成国家计划，改变了过去前松后紧的现象。天津钢厂炼钢部工人都能掌握作业计划中规定的生产进度，每人经过计算都知道，如果有一分钟完不成生产任务，就会给国家带来了损失。北京石景山发电厂曾经对六十二个小组检查了执行计划的情况，结果一般都能完成生产计划，并有十个组做出了优良的成绩。（新华社）
