Xinhua News Agency, Rome, June 22nd: According to TASS, the leadership of the Italian Communist Party held a meeting in Rome on June 17th and 18th to study the results of the recent parliamentary elections. The meeting passed a resolution stating: "The Italian people have achieved a victory because, after a long and arduous struggle, they finally defeated the hateful electoral law, which would have allowed Italy to produce representatives who did not conform to the will of the people, thereby ensuring five years of arbitrary reactionary rule. … The failure of the deceptive electoral law is a victory for democratic forces, and a shameful failure for the leaders of the Christian Democratic Party, the Social Democratic Party, the Liberal Party, and the Republican Party. … The victory of the Communist Party is the inevitable result of our party's more than five years of resistance and struggle against conspiracies to isolate our party from the people, declare it illegal, isolate it, and destroy it. … The Communist Party's victory in the election is also a victory for the international and domestic peace policies advocated by the Communist Party. This victory means that the people are increasingly widely supporting the Communist Party's program of struggle, namely, opposing poverty and implementing social reforms in a timely manner in accordance with the Constitution of the Republic to improve the people's living standards. The Communist Party's victory in the election means that the policies pursued by the Christian Democratic Party and its allies since 1948 have been openly condemned; their policies are to prepare for war, incite hatred and disputes at home, and maintain privileges and social injustices."

The resolution also stated: "In the situation created after the elections on June 7th and 8th, the leadership of the Communist Party believes and emphasizes first and foremost that this election must be democratically assessed; it must be announced that the current policies must be changed as demanded by the left-wing parties. Millions of people, through elections, advocate changing current policies. The Communists understand that Italy must have a stable government, and have concluded on this point. The Communists understand that, under the current parliamentary circumstances, it is only possible to establish a stable government on the basis of agreements reached by all political parties. However, to achieve such an agreement, it is impossible not to take into account the true intentions of the people and the opinions of the millions of voters who voted for the Communist Party and the Socialist Party, who demand the implementation of new policies that advocate peace and social reform. This is precisely the kind of policy that Italy needs to implement today. Any attempt to deny this necessity and evade this necessity will only complicate the domestic situation." The leadership of the Communist Party decided to instruct the Central Committee to further study the election results and further clarify its position.

    意共代表千百万人民要求改变现行政策
    主张各党派在协议基础上建立稳定的政府
    【新华社二十四日讯】据塔斯社罗马二十二日讯：意大利共产党指导处于六月十七、十八两日在罗马举行会议，研究了最近的议会选举的结果。会上通过决议说：“意大利人民取得了胜利，因为他们经过了长期艰苦的斗争之后，终于击败了可恨的选举法，这种选举法会使意大利产生出不符合人民意志的代表，从而保证为期五年的为所欲为的反动统治。……骗人的选举法的失败，就是民主势力的胜利，也就是天主教民主党、社会民主党、自由党、共和党领导人物的可耻的失败。……共产党的胜利是我们党在五年多来与企图将我党与人民隔离开来、宣布它为非法、孤立它并摧毁它的阴谋进行反抗与斗争的必然结果。……共产党在选举中的胜利，也就是共产党所主张的国际、国内和平政策的胜利。这一胜利意味着：人民日益广泛地支持共产党的斗争纲领，即反对贫困，按照共和国宪法及时地进行社会改革以提高人民的生活水平。共产党在选举中的胜利意味着：天主教民主党及其同盟者自一九四八年以来所奉行的政策受到了一次公开的谴责，他们的政策就是准备战争、在国内煽动仇视与纠纷、维护特权和社会上不合理的现象。”
    决议又说：“在六月七、八两日选举之后所造成的形势中，共产党指导处认为并首先着重指出，必须民主地估计这一次选举；必须宣布按照左翼政党所要求的那样来改变现行的政策。千百万人民通过选举主张改变现行政策。共产党人明白意大利必须有一个稳定的政府，而且在这一点上作了结论。共产党人了解到，在目前的议会情况下，只有在各政治党派取得协议的基础上，才有可能建立起一个稳定的政府。但是，要达到这种协议，不能不考虑到人民的真正意向和投票赞成共产党和社会党的几百万选民的意见，他们要求执行主张和平与改革社会的新政策。今天意大利需要执行的正是这样的一种政策。一切否定这种必要和回避这种必要的企图，只会使得国内局势复杂化。”共产党指导处决定责成中央委员会进一步研究选举结果和更加明确自己的立场。
