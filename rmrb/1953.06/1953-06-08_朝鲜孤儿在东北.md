Korean Orphans in the Northeast
Chinese People Console the Korean Children's Delegation in China, Jilin Branch

Taking the Changtu railway line to Longjiabao, and then crossing a wide and fertile land, you can see a school building with a small sports ground. This is the Jilin Jiutai County Korean First Nursery, home to one hundred and thirty-two Korean orphans, and thirty-nine teachers and staff from Korea. These children were rescued from the fires of war, from enemy bombing. When the children first arrived from Korea, wearing newly issued cotton clothes, they were too weak to bear the weight. Looking at their sallow faces, the Chinese mothers could not help but shed tears. But now, these little guests are completely changed; their rosy little faces look like round apples. Boys wearing little navy hats, and girls wearing turquoise wide-brimmed hats and turquoise dance dresses, swing on the swings, ride on rocking horses, and slide down the slides on the sports ground like angels. In the clean dormitories, there is a row of colorful little quilts, and the nannies have pasted some colorful pictures and tied some colorful flags, making the room look peaceful and beautiful. The children no longer hear the ghostly wailing of enemy planes. Although they are young, the war has taught them many things; they know what they should do and know that they must study hard for their motherland. The Chinese people care for them like their own children, providing care and assistance. The Korean teachers, nannies, and all staff educate them according to the Korean education system and living habits, and even the Chinese chefs carefully learn to cook Korean-style dishes. The children say: "We feel like we are living in our own motherland, in our own home."

On the eve of International Children's Day, the Chinese People's Delegation to Console Korean Children in China arrived in the Northeast, bringing the feelings and gifts of the Chinese people – all kinds of toys, musical instruments, record players, medical supplies, stationery, sweets, and so on. The children were extremely happy and felt warm. They felt loved and cared for by many peace-loving parents. In the joyous atmosphere, seven-year-old Li Haizi was so moved that she began to cry softly.

When she first arrived in China, Li Haizi didn't cry or laugh all day, remaining silent, thinking deeply like an adult. Everyone understood what was happening, there were too many such children in Korea. Chinese doctors treated the children's physical wounds; Chinese parents and children treated the wounds in the children's hearts, and their Amni (children call their nannies and teachers Amni or Abaji [Note]) carefully took care of them. Later, Li Haizi gradually became happier. But from her small eyes, people could clearly see that she had not forgotten how her mother died. She finally said it:

"...I saw my mother fall down. I wanted to run to hug her, but suddenly something very heavy knocked me down. When I woke up, I immediately remembered my mother. Why hadn't my mother come to hug me and kiss me yet? I looked up and suddenly found my mother lying stiff in a pool of blood. Little Hui Shu was crawling over to grab her mother, but her mother had completely changed. Her body was covered in blood, and both her legs had been blown off. Those American ghost planes were still buzzing overhead; I forgot everything and desperately threw myself at my mother. I wanted to hug her neck. Suddenly, I found that one of my hands was gone. I used my remaining hand to hold my mother's head and pressed my face against her cold face. I didn't know anything. The sound of explosions woke me up again. Rows of houses were collapsing in smoke, and a little friend who I used to play with, was blindly grabbing and rolling on the ground with blood flowing from his eyes..."

Why was Li Haizi crying? The hearts of Chinese parents moved her. She understood that in addition to American shells, there were these kind hearts.

Among the more than 20,000 Korean orphans in the Northeast, no one knows how many have had such tragic experiences. They understand love and hate. Among the older orphans, we see some young heroes who have won medals for meritorious service and honorary medals. Deep love and hate make the orphans brave and strong. Their hatred for the American aggressors and their determination for revenge drive them to study harder. Most of the children get full marks in tests. The children love and miss their motherland, and they draw the landscapes of their motherland. A little child heard a bird call that he often heard in Korea, and he happily ran to tell Amni: "The Korean birds have also come to China with us." They can't forget their motherland, and therefore they can't forget their hatred.

Among the children's teachers and nannies, some were originally educators, and others returned from the army. On the battlefield, they were heroes; among the children, they are a mother or father, and the children call them that. They educate the children more earnestly and patiently than at any other time. They research and compile teaching materials themselves, and they bring revolutionary optimism to every child.

These children are also warmly welcomed by Chinese cadres and the masses. Chinese children have planted many small trees with green branches and leaves in the spacious backyard for their Korean little brothers and sisters, and send them letters from Beijing, the Southwest, and other places, sending them their beloved little gifts and their own drawings. District Chief Cai Benlong found that the children lacked a harmonium, so he personally took the train to Changchun to buy one, and personally carried it from the station to the nursery; the cadres come to see them every few days, to understand their needs and difficulties. Chinese mothers wash the children's clothes and quilts, and send fresh chicken eggs for the children to eat. Chinese mothers in distant places, knowing that someone is going to the Northeast, some of them write letters to the children while supporting their illness, ask people to buy toys from the street, and ask people to bring them to the Northeast. All this not only shows the hearts of Chinese mothers and children, but also shows the unbreakable deep friendship between the peace-loving Chinese and Korean people.

[Note] "Amni or Abaji" means "Mother or Father"

    朝鲜孤儿在东北
    中国人民慰问住我国朝鲜儿童代表团吉林分团
    坐长图线的火车到龙家堡，再穿过一片宽阔而肥沃的土地，就可以看见一所校舍，有一个小小的运动场。这是吉林九台县朝鲜第一爱育园，这里住着一百三十二个朝鲜的孤儿，和来自朝鲜的三十九位教师和工作人员。这些孩子都是从战争的炮火中，从敌人的轰炸下被抢救出来的。孩子们刚从朝鲜来时，穿上新发的棉衣，他们竟衰弱得架不住。看着他们黄蜡似的面孔，中国的妈妈们禁不住流眼泪了。可是现在，这些小客人完全改变了，红润的小面孔真像圆圆的苹果。戴着小海军帽的男孩，和戴着翠蓝色宽沿帽、穿着翠蓝色小舞衣的女孩，像天使一样在运动场上荡着鞦韆、骑着木马、溜着滑梯。在整洁的寝室里，摆着一溜花花绿绿的小被子，褓姆们为他们贴上一些彩色画片，结上一些彩旗，屋子里显得恬静而美丽。孩子们再听不到像鬼号似的敌机声了。他们年纪虽小，但战争使他们懂得了很多事情，他们懂得应该怎样做，懂得要为祖国努力学习。中国人民像爱自己孩子似地爱护他们，照顾和帮助他们。朝鲜的教师、褓姆和一切工作人员都依照着朝鲜的教育制度和生活习惯来教育他们，连中国的厨师也精心学习烹调朝鲜风味的菜食。孩子们说： “我们好像是住在自己的祖国、自己的家里一样。”
    在国际儿童节前夕，中国人民慰问住中国朝鲜儿童代表团到了东北，带来了中国人民的情意和礼物——各种各样的玩具、乐器、留声机、医药用品、文具、糖果等等。孩子们全高兴极了，他们感到温暖。他们觉得被许多爱好和平的父母爱抚着、关注着。在欢乐的气氛中，忽然七岁的李海子感动得轻声哭了起来。
    刚到中国的时候，李海子整天的不哭也不笑，沉默着，像一个大人一样地在深思着什么。谁都明白这是怎么一回事，朝鲜这样的孩子是太多了。中国的医生治疗着孩子们身体上的创伤；中国的父母和儿童治疗着孩子们心里的创伤，他们的阿姆尼（孩子们喊他们的褓姆、教师为阿姆尼或阿巴几〔注〕）小心翼翼地护理着他们。以后，李海子渐渐愉快起来了。但是从她的小眼睛里，人们完全可以看得出她并没有忘记妈妈是怎样死的。她终于说出来了：
    “……我看见妈妈倒下去，我正想跑去抱住妈妈，忽然一个很重的什么东西把我摔倒了；等我醒来，我立刻记起妈妈，妈妈为什么还没来抱我，亲我呢？我抬起头来，忽然发现妈妈直挺挺地倒在血地里，
     小惠淑正爬过去抓住妈妈，妈妈全变了，身上鲜血淋淋，两条腿被炸掉了。那些美国的鬼飞机还在头上直嗡嗡；我什么都忘了，拚命朝妈妈扑过去，我想搂住妈妈的脖子。突然我发现我的一只手也不见了，我用剩下的一只手抱着妈妈的头，把我的脸贴在她冰凉的脸上。我什么都不知道了。爆炸的声音又把我惊醒。成排的房子冒着烟在倒塌，和我常在一块玩的一个小朋友，两眼流着血在地上瞎抓乱滚……”
    李海子为什么哭呢？中国父母的心感动着她。她懂得除了美国的炮弹外，还有这些善良的心。
    在东北二万多个朝鲜孤儿中，有这样惨酷的遭遇的不知有多少。他们懂得爱和恨。在较大的一些孤儿里，我们看见一些得过军功章、荣誉章的小英雄，深刻的爱和恨，使孤儿勇敢而坚强。他们对美国侵略者的痛恨和复仇的决心，使他们加紧学习，大部分孩子在测验时都得到了满分。孩子们热爱和怀念着祖国，他们画着祖国的山水。一个小孩子听见一只在朝鲜常听到的鸟叫，他高兴得跑去告诉阿姆尼：“朝鲜的小鸟也跟我们一块儿来中国了。”他们是忘不了祖国，因此也忘不了仇恨。
    在孩子们的老师和褓姆中，一部分原是教育工作者，另一部分是从部队回来的。在战场上，他（她）们是英雄；在孩子们中，他们是一个妈妈或爸爸，孩子们也这样呼喊他们。他们比任何一个时期更认真、更耐心地教育着孩子。他们自己研究和编写教材，他们把革命的乐观情绪带给了每个孩子。
    这些孩子，同样受到中国干部和群众的热烈欢迎。中国的孩子们，给朝鲜的小弟妹们在宽敞的后园种上了很多青枝绿叶的小树，从北京、从西南、从其他各地寄信给他们，寄自己心爱的小礼物给他们，寄自己画的画页给他们。区长蔡本龙发现孩子们缺少一架风琴，他亲自坐火车到长春采买，又亲自从车站背着送到爱育园；干部们三天两头的来看望他们；了解他们的需要和困难。中国的妈妈们给孩子们洗刷衣被，送新鲜的鸡子给孩子们吃，在远方的中国妈妈们，知道有人去东北，她们中间有的扶着病给孩子们写信，托人从街上买回玩具，又托人带到东北。这一切不但表现了中国的母亲和孩子的心，而且表现了热爱和平的中朝两国人民的牢不可破的深厚友谊。
