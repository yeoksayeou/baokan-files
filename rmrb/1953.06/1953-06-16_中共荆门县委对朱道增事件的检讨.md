Response to People's Daily Readers' Criticism and Suggestions

    CCP Jingmen County Committee's Self-Criticism on the Zhu Daozeng Incident
    The CCP Jingmen County Committee wrote: Your newspaper published on March 13th a reader, Wang Xiangcheng's, criticism of Zhu Daozeng, the Fifth District Chief of our county, for violating laws and discipline and illegally disbanding the Shihuiqiao Town Women's Federation organization. After investigation, it is proven that the vast majority of the criticism is factual. Indeed, Zhu Daozeng's poor work style and serious detachment from the masses have had a very negative impact on the prestige of the Party and the People's Government. However, Zhu Daozeng's mistakes are mainly due to the bureaucracy of our county committee – we usually lack in-depth understanding of our cadres, and our education is very poor, especially in terms of policies and working methods, which we do not adequately explain to our cadres. Therefore, we should bear certain responsibility for Zhu Daozeng's mistakes. Now, in addition to ordering Zhu Daozeng and the Fifth District Committee to make self-criticisms and re-addressing the marriage issue of Song Zhaolian, the finance and grain cadre of the district, in order to educate cadres and restore the prestige of the Party and the People's Government, the Party has decided to give Zhu Daozeng a public warning as a disciplinary action and recommend that the administration give him a demerit. The People's Daily's exposure of the Zhu Daozeng incident has alerted us. In the future, we must work hard to overcome bureaucracy.

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    中共荆门县委对朱道增事件的检讨
    中共荆门县委来信：你报三月十三日刊登读者王相成对我县第五区区长朱道增违法乱纪、非法解散石回桥镇妇女联合会组织的批评，经检查后，证明绝大部分是事实。的确，朱道增的恶劣作风和严重脱离群众的行为，使党和人民政府的威信受到很不好的影响。但朱道增的错误，主要是由于我们县委的官僚主义造成的——平常我们对干部缺乏深入了解，教育也很差，特别是在政策上和工作方法上对干部交代得更是不够。所以朱道增的错误，我们应该负一定责任。现在，我们除已责令朱道增和第五区区委作了检讨、对该区财粮干事宋兆廉的婚姻问题重作处理外，为了教育干部，挽回党和人民政府的威信，党内已决定给朱道增以当众警告处分，并建议行政上给予记过处分。人民日报对朱道增事件的揭发引起了我们的警惕，今后我们要很好地克服官僚主义。
