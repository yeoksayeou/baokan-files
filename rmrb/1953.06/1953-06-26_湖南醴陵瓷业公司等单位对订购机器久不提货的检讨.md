    Self-criticism of Hunan Liling Ceramics Company and Other Units for Long Delays in Picking Up Ordered Machines

    The "Reader's Letters Summary" column on May 15 published a reader's letter from Yang Dehui criticizing the Jingdezhen Demonstration Ceramics Factory in Jiangxi and the Hunan Liling Ceramics Company (the original criticism mistakenly referred to the Liling Enterprise Company) for ordering machines from the Tangshan Ceramics Machinery Factory and failing to pick them up for a long time. The reply letters from the relevant units are now excerpted and published below:

    Letter from the Industry Department of the Jiangxi Provincial People's Government: Our department's Jingdezhen Demonstration Ceramics Factory ordered ceramic machines from the Tangshan Ceramics Machinery Factory in January 1952 and failed to pick them up on time, causing difficulties for the work of the Tangshan Ceramics Machinery Factory. This attitude of not complying with the contract is wrong. Now, due to changes in the basic construction plan figures, the Jingdezhen Demonstration Ceramics Factory was ordered to shut down in February of this year. We are preparing to build a warehouse to store these ceramic machines and have decided to send someone to Tangshan in June to inspect the machines and arrange for their transportation.

    Letter from Hunan Liling Ceramics Company: Our company ordered ceramic machines from the Tangshan Ceramics Machinery Factory but failed to transport them on time. On the one hand, this was due to several changes in our company's factory construction plan, but mainly because our understanding of strictly implementing contracts was not clear. We sincerely accept the reader's criticism. In addition to sending someone to pick up the machines on May 4, we are determined to correct this work style.

### 湖南醴陵瓷业公司等单位对订购机器久不提货的检讨

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    湖南醴陵瓷业公司等单位对订购机器久不提货的检讨
    五月十五日“读者来信摘要”栏刊载了读者杨德辉批评江西景德镇示范瓷厂和湖南醴陵瓷业公司
    （原批评信误为醴陵企业公司）向唐山窑业机器厂订购机器后长期不提货的来信，现将有关单位的答复信摘要发表于后：
    江西省人民政府工业厅来信：我厅所属景德镇示范瓷厂于一九五二年一月向唐山窑业机器厂订制陶瓷机器不按时提货，使唐山窑业机器厂的工作遇到困难，这种不遵守合同的态度是错误的。现在由于基本建设计划数字变更，景德镇示范瓷厂已于今年二月奉令停办。我们正筹建储存该项陶瓷机器的仓库，并决定在六月份内，即派人去唐山验收机器，办理提运。
    湖南醴陵瓷业公司来信：我公司在唐山窑业机器厂订购陶瓷机器，过期没提运，一方面固然因为我公司建厂计划曾有数次变更，但主要的还是因为我们对严格执行合同的思想不明确。我们诚恳接受读者批评，除已于五月四日派人前往提运外，并决心改正这种工作作风。
