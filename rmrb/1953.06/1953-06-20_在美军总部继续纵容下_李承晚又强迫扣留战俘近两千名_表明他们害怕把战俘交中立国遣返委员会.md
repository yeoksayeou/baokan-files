Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 19th – Special correspondent Jiang Nan reports: With the continued connivance of the U.S. side, another one thousand eight hundred and thirteen non-directly repatriated Chinese and Korean People's Army prisoners of war were coerced by the Syngman Rhee gang this morning to leave the prisoner-of-war camp and join the Syngman Rhee puppet army.

After the Syngman Rhee gang "released" 25,000 prisoners of war, the commander of the U.S. prisoner-of-war camp, McGarr, not only failed to take necessary measures on the 18th, but also declared, "If they want to do it again tonight, they can still do it." He said that he would continue to use South Korean guards to guard those prisoners of war who had not been coerced by the Syngman Rhee gang to leave the prisoner-of-war camp.

According to a United Press report from Busan on the 18th, senior South Korean officials in Busan declared that most of the "released" prisoners of war would be incorporated into the Rhee puppet army. The United Press said that prisoners of war from the Nonsan and Sangmu-dae prisoner-of-war camps had been escorted by Syngman Rhee's military police directly to nearby military training bases of the Rhee puppet army. Prisoners of war "released" from other prisoner-of-war camps were escorted by South Korean police and troops to Busan and Seoul, where they were dressed in civilian clothes and forced to report to Syngman Rhee's conscription stations. The Syngman Rhee gang issued a strict "military conscription order" on the same day that they "released" the prisoners of war, and they made no secret of their intention to use these "released" prisoners of war to quickly form four new divisions.

The U.S. side is now spreading rumors that they will "catch back" these prisoners of war who were "released" with their tacit approval, and they say that they have already "caught back" nearly a thousand prisoners of war. But anyone can see that this is just a gesture to deceive public opinion. The commander of the U.S. prisoner-of-war camp, McGarr, admitted that these one thousand prisoners of war were not "caught back," but returned voluntarily. They had apparently escaped the control of the Rhee gang and returned after being coerced by the Syngman Rhee gang to leave the prisoner-of-war camp. They preferred to stay in the prisoner-of-war camp so that they would have the opportunity to be repatriated home after the armistice. McGarr also openly declared that it was impossible to "catch back" those prisoners of war who had been taken away by the Syngman Rhee gang. Moreover, according to a United Press report from Busan on the 19th, small groups of prisoners of war were escorted through the center of Busan, where U.S. military police were patrolling. "A U.S. military policeman who asked not to be named said that he had received orders not to interfere with this action."

For two consecutive days, the U.S. side has allowed the Syngman Rhee gang to "release" large numbers of prisoners of war from U.S.-controlled prisoner-of-war camps and forcibly detain them to serve as cannon fodder. The U.S. side has consistently failed to take any decisive measures to reverse this situation. This breach of the agreement by the U.S. side gives world opinion ample reason to question the U.S. government's "sincerity" in achieving an armistice in Korea.

Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 19th – Special correspondent Wu Min reports: General Nam Il ordered his liaison officer on the afternoon of the 19th to notify the U.S. liaison officer that the representatives of both sides should reconvene at 11:00 a.m. on the 20th due to a major event. This is likely related to the serious violation of the agreement involving the large-scale transfer of Korean People's Army prisoners of war to Syngman Rhee. After many days and nights of busy activity in Panmunjom, the 19th was very quiet.

Syngman Rhee, with U.S. connivance, "released" 25,952 Korean People's Army prisoners of war on the 18th and 19th. Syngman Rhee and the U.S. warmongers' final provocative act to obstruct the armistice at a time when the signing of the armistice agreement is imminent has aroused extreme public indignation.

Observers here point out that all evidence proves that this conspiracy to violate the recently signed agreement on prisoners of war was prepared by Syngman Rhee long ago, and that the U.S. military authorities were aware of it. The U.S. military headquarters cannot evade responsibility for this serious breach of the agreement, for restraining all troops under its command—including the Syngman Rhee troops—from fulfilling the solemn obligations that have been announced to the world.

A United Press dispatch from Tokyo reported that Clark had notified Washington of Syngman Rhee's actions to undermine the imminent armistice agreement, but had not taken any measures to prevent Syngman Rhee's conspiracy to violate the agreement and detain prisoners of war from being realized.

On the contrary, there was encouragement. Syngman Rhee said in his statement, "Most of the United Nations forces authorities with whom I have discussed our hope to release these prisoners sympathize with us and agree with us in principle."

Before this unilateral "release" of Korean prisoners of war, strong world opinion demanding peace had forced the U.S. representatives to withdraw their counterproposal of May 13 to hand over the Korean prisoners of war to Syngman Rhee, and had signed an agreement to hand over all non-directly repatriated prisoners of war to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission for custody.

Observers believe that this serious violation of the agreement on prisoners of war is tantamount to a public admission that they are afraid to hand over non-directly repatriated prisoners of war to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, lest these prisoners of war exercise their right to be repatriated. The blatant detention of Korean prisoners of war marks the complete bankruptcy of the hypocritical excuses of "voluntary repatriation" and "non-forcible repatriation," and cannot withstand the test of even handing over prisoners of war to neutral countries for custody and handling. This proves that they are deeply afraid that the prisoners of war will resolutely demand to go home. Returning Korean prisoners of war have testified that Syngman Rhee sent thousands of agents disguised as prisoners of war into the prisoner-of-war camps to intimidate the prisoners of war and to say on their behalf that they would "oppose explanation" and would "refuse repatriation."

This "release" of Korean prisoners of war is clearly nothing more than transferring the prisoners of war from the prisoner-of-war camps to the hands of Syngman Rhee's military police. Syngman Rhee announced, "The provincial governors and police officers have been ordered to do their best to take care of these released prisoners of war." Syngman Rhee's military personnel took them to nearby military centers in South Korea in order to force them to join the puppet army.

Syngman Rhee and the U.S. anti-armistice elements have exposed themselves before the world as heinous violators of solemn agreements and the Geneva Conventions. Their plans to "unify Korea" by force and to demand the detention of prisoners of war at the conference table to obstruct the armistice have failed, and the signing of the armistice agreement is imminent. Their last resort is to use such provocative actions as blatant violation of the agreement to deceive the world's demand for an armistice. Syngman Rhee's forced detention of 25,952 prisoners of war is a provocation and a warning, urging world opinion demanding peace to double its vigilance and exert its utmost efforts to urge the U.S. government to order Syngman Rhee's government and army to strictly abide by the solemn agreement and immediately send this batch of 25,952 abducted prisoners of war back to the prisoner-of-war camps so that they can be handed over to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission for custody and handling after the armistice.

### 在美军总部继续纵容下  李承晚又强迫扣留战俘近两千名  表明他们害怕把战俘交中立国遣返委员会

    在美军总部继续纵容下
    李承晚又强迫扣留战俘近两千名
    表明他们害怕把战俘交中立国遣返委员会
    【新华社开城十九日电】本社特派记者江南报道，在美方继续纵容之下，又有一千八百十三名不直接遣返的我朝鲜人民军被俘人员，在十九日早晨被李承晚匪帮胁迫离开战俘营去参加李承晚伪军。
    在李承晚匪帮“释放”了二万五千名战俘之后，美方战俘营司令麦克加尔在十八日不但没有采取应有的措施，反而宣称，“如果他们今晚还想干一下的话，他们还是可以干。”他说，他将继续用南朝鲜卫兵来看守那些没有被李承晚匪帮胁迫离开战俘营的战俘。
    据美联社釜山十八日电报道说，在釜山的南朝鲜高级官员宣称，大多数被“释放”的战俘将被编入李伪军。美联社说，从论山和尚武台战俘营出来的战俘，已经被李承晚的军事警察押送着直接开往附近李伪军的军事训练基地。从其他战俘营“释放”出来的战俘被南朝鲜的警察和军队押送着进入釜山、汉城，换上了平民的服装，同时被迫向李承晚的征兵站报到。李承晚匪帮在“释放”战俘的同一天颁布了严格的“军事征召令”，他们毫不掩饰他们要利用这些被“释放”的战俘迅速编成四个新的师。
    美方现在放出空气，说他们要把这些在他们默许之下被“释放”的战俘“抓回来”，并且说他们已经“抓回来”了将近一千名战俘。但是谁都可以看得出来这只不过是一种用来欺骗舆论的姿态。美方战俘营司令麦克加尔承认，这一千名战俘并不是什么“抓回来”的，而是自动回来的。他们显然是在被李承晚匪帮胁迫离开战俘营以后，设法逃脱李匪帮的控制而逃回来的。他们宁愿留在战俘营里，以便在停战以后能有被遣返回家的机会。麦克加尔还公开宣称，要“抓回来”那些被李承晚匪帮带走的战俘是不可能的。而且，据美联社釜山十九日电说，一小队一小队的战俘被押着经过釜山市中心区，在那里有美国宪兵在巡逻着。“一位要求不把他的名字说出来的美国宪兵说，他接到命令叫他不要去干涉这种行动。”
    接连两天，美方听任李承晚匪帮从美方控制的战俘营里“释放”大批战俘并强迫扣留他们充当炮灰，美方始终没有采取任何断然措施来挽回这个局面。美方这种破坏协议的行为，使全世界舆论有充分的理由质问美国政府，它在朝鲜实现停战的“诚意”究竟在什么地方呢？
    【新华社开城十九日电】本社特派记者吴敏报道：南日大将十九日下午已经命令他的联络官通过美国联络官提出通知，因有重大事件双方代表团应在二十日上午十一时复会。这大约是和朝鲜人民军被俘人员被大批地交给李承晚这种严重的破坏协议的事件有关。板门店经过许多昼夜的忙碌活动以后，十九日很沉寂。
    李承晚在美国纵容之下于十八、十九两日“释放”了二万五千九百五十二名朝鲜人民军被俘人员，李承晚以及美国的好战分子们在这个停战协定的签字已经迫在眼前的时候还要来阻碍停战的最后挑衅行为，已经引起公众的极端愤慨。
    这里的观察家指出，一切证据都证明了这次破坏最近签订的关于战俘问题的协议的阴谋是李承晚老早就准备好了的，而且美国军事当局是知情的。美军总部对于这个严重破坏协议的行为，对于约束在它指挥下的一切部队——包括李承晚部队在内——履行已向世界宣布的庄严的义务，是无法逃避责任的。
    合众社东京的一个电讯报道，克拉克已把李承晚破坏即将来到的停战协定的行动通知华盛顿，但是并没有采取任何措施阻止李承晚的破坏协议、扣留战俘的阴谋的实现。
    相反地，有的是鼓励。李承晚在他的声明中说，
    “凡是我曾和他谈过我们希望释放这些俘虏的大多数联合国军方面的当局人士，都是同情我们并且在原则上赞成我们的。”
    这种片面“释放”朝鲜战俘的行为发生之前，要求和平的强大世界舆论已迫使美方代表收回他们五月十三日提出的主张把朝鲜战俘交给李承晚的反建议，并且在把所有不直接遣返的战俘交由中立国遣返委员会收容的协议上签了字。
    观察家们认为，这种严重破坏关于战俘协议的行为，等于公开供认他们害怕把不直接遣返的战俘交给中立国遣返委员会，唯恐这些战俘行使他们被遣返的权利。公然扣留朝鲜战俘的行为，标志着“自愿遣返”和“不强迫遣返”的虚伪藉口的彻底破产，经不起即使把战俘交给中立国看管和处理这样的考验。这证明了他们深怕战俘们会坚决要求回家。归来的朝鲜被俘人员证明说，李承晚派了几千名特务假装战俘混进战俘营中，恐吓战俘并代替他们说，他们将“反对解释”，并将“拒绝遣返”。
    这种“释放”朝鲜战俘，显然不过是把战俘从战俘营转移到李承晚的军警手中罢了。李承晚宣布，“各道长官和警察官员已奉命尽力照料这些被释放了的战俘”。李承晚的军事人员把他们带到在南朝鲜的附近军事中心，以便强迫他们参加傀儡军。
    李承晚和美国反停战分子在世界面前暴露出是庄严协定和日内瓦公约的罪恶的破坏者。他们要想用武力来“统一朝鲜”并且在会议桌上要求扣留战俘以阻碍停战的计划失败了，停战协定的签字已迫在眼前。他们最后的一着就是用公然破坏协议这种挑衅行动来愚弄世界对停战的要求。李承晚的强迫扣留二万五千九百五十二名战俘，是一种挑衅，也是一种警告，要世界要求和平的舆论加倍提高和运用最大的警惕，来督促美国政府命令李承晚的政府和军队严格遵守庄严的协议，立即将这批被劫夺的二万五千九百五十二名战俘送回战俘营，以便在停战后交给中立国遣返委员会看管和处理。
