Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, June 3rd: Yefremov published an article in "Red Star", commenting on France's economic difficulties.

Yefremov said: U.S. "aid" is disintegrating the French economy and leading France to disaster. Materials published in the French monthly "New Democracy" show that during the implementation of the Marshall Plan from 1947 to 1951, a full 220.7 tons of gold were transferred from French banks to the vaults of Wall Street. At the same time, France's foreign debt increased from 33 billion francs to 1,267 billion francs, and the number of industrial and commercial bankruptcies roughly tripled.

U.S. monopoly capital is doing everything possible to seize France's position in the capitalist world market. The infiltration of U.S. capital into France's sphere of influence has caused enormous difficulties for French exports. France, which originally had economic ties with many countries, has gradually become unilaterally connected with the United States. This relationship has caused France great losses. France pays very high prices for U.S. goods. For example, France has to buy coal from the United States at a price higher than that of West European coal. However, the United States and other countries in the dollar zone are using high tariffs to resist French goods. The height of these tariffs can be seen from the fact that the United States often taxes imported French shoes at as much as 40 percent of their price. All of this has led to a continuous deterioration of France's foreign trade deficit. In 1950, the deficit was 102 billion francs; in 1951 it increased to 342 billion francs, and in 1952 it jumped to 413 billion francs.

At the same time, under the pressure of U.S. monopoly capitalists, France has greatly reduced its trade with countries of the democratic camp. The French "Communist Handbook" states: "France now does business as if there are no 800 million customers, accounting for one-third of all mankind, in the world. It is very obvious that this situation is absurd and intolerable."

Although the French ruling clique is placing the heavy burden of military expenditure on the people, the French financial system is still collapsing due to the huge military expenditure. The national budget deficit is 804 billion francs, inflation continues, and the amount of paper money issued has reached the astronomical figure of 2,124 billion francs. The value of the franc continues to fall.

Economic sectors not directly related to military orders are in a very difficult situation. According to the General Confederation of Labor, French shoe production has decreased by 36 percent compared with the pre-war year of 1938. The output of textiles in the first half of 1952 was only 83.3 percent of the level of 1929. The situation in heavy industry is not much better.

Yefremov concluded by writing: Due to these difficulties, French bourgeois groups are increasingly demanding to break away from the control of U.S. monopoly capitalists, because they also want to seek maximum profits. "Le Monde" pointed out: French capitalists are angered by the U.S. attempt to encroach on their interests and rights. French industrialists have expressed increasing dissatisfaction with the ban on doing business with the Soviet Union and other democratic countries.

Xinhua News Agency, Paris, June 4th: According to Agence France-Presse, Paris, France's debt to the European Payments Union in May was between approximately $54 million and $60 million; while the debt in April was $51.6 million, and in March it was $19.4 million. Agence France-Presse quoted the opinion of "authoritative sources" in Paris as saying: The sharp increase in the foreign payment deficit in April and May was mainly because French exporters, fearing a domestic "adjustment" of the currency system, were reluctant to remit the foreign exchange they earned back to the country.

### 美国的“援助”使法国经济情况越来越坏  法国资产阶级强烈要求摆脱美国控制

    美国的“援助”使法国经济情况越来越坏
    法国资产阶级强烈要求摆脱美国控制
    【新华社六日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科三日讯：叶夫雷莫夫在“红星报”发表文章，评论法国的经济困难。
    叶夫雷莫夫说：美国的“援助”正在瓦解法国的经济，把法国引向灾难。法国“新民主”月刊发表的材料说明：在一九四七年到一九五一年马歇尔计划实行期间，整整有二百二十点七吨的黄金从法国的银行转移到华尔街的保险箱里。同时，法国的外债从三百三十亿法郎增加到一万二千六百七十亿法郎，工商业破产的数目大约增加了三倍。
    美国垄断资本千方百计地夺取法国在资本主义世界市场上的地位。美国的资本渗入法国势力范围，使法国的输出遭到巨大的困难。法国本来和许多国家有经济联系，现在却渐渐变成了和美国的单边联系。这种关系使法国遭到巨大损失。法国为美国货付出很高的价钱。例如法国不得不以高于西欧煤的价钱向美国买煤。但美国和美元区的其它国家却以提高关税来抵制法国货。这种关税之高可以从这个事实看出：美国对于入口的法国鞋抽税往往高达价格的百分之四十。所有这些都使得法国对外贸易逆差不断恶化。在一九五○年，逆差是一千零二十亿法郎；一九五一年增加到了三千四百二十亿法郎，一九五二年又跃升到四千一百三十亿法郎。
    同时，在美国垄断资本家的压力下，法国大大削减了对民主阵营各国的贸易。法国“共产主义手册”说：“法国现在做生意就好像世界上并没有占全人类三分之一的八亿顾客存在一样。非常明显，这种情况是荒谬而不能容忍的。”
    虽然法国的统治集团把军事开支的重担加在人民肩上，但是法国财政制度仍因庞大的军事开支而土崩瓦解。国家预算赤字达八千零四十亿法郎，通货膨胀在继续，纸币发行量已经达到二万一千二百四十亿法郎的天文数字。法郎的价值在继续下跌。
    和军事定货没有直接关系的经济部门处境都非常困难。根据总工会的材料，法国鞋子的产量比战前一九三八年减少了百分之三十六。纺织品的产量在一九五二年上半年只有一九二九年的水平的百分之八十三点三。重工业的景况也不见得好一些。
    叶夫雷莫夫最后写道：由于这些困难，法国资产阶级集团正越来越强烈地要求摆脱美国垄断资本家的控制，因为他们也要谋取最高利润。“世界报”指出：法国资本家对美国企图侵占他们的利益和权利感到愤怒。法国工业家已表示愈来愈不满于禁止他们和苏联及各民主国家做生意。
    【新华社四日讯】据法国法新社巴黎消息透露，五月份法国对欧洲支付同盟各国的负欠约在五千四百万美元到六千万美元之间；而四月份的负欠是五千一百六十万美元，三月份是一千九百四十万美元。法新社引巴黎“权威人士”的意见说：四、五月份对外支付赤字急遽增加，主要是因为法国出口商恐怕国内要“调整”币制，而迟迟不肯把赚得的外汇汇回国。
