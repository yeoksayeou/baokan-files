On the Front Lines of National Economic Construction

    Northeast Electrical Engineering Plant No. 5 Successfully Trial-Produces Large Transformer
    Northeast Electrical Engineering Plant No. 5 has successfully trial-produced a large transformer of 66,000 volts and 10,000 kilovolt-amperes. The experiment was conducted on May 31, and the effect was good, with the quality meeting the standard requirements. This large transformer is manufactured according to the most advanced Soviet standards. It can supply power for the substation needs of three factories with 5,000 people each or a city with a population of 200,000. This is of great significance to China's rapidly developing industry and current capital construction.
    In the process of trial-producing large transformers, Northeast Electrical Engineering Plant No. 5 received significant assistance from Soviet experts. At the same time, the workers also demonstrated a high degree of initiative and creativity, found many tricks, and solved equipment and technical difficulties. For example, the large transformer itself weighs 35 tons, while the assembly workshop only has a 15-ton crane. Zhao Pujun, the workshop foreman, proposed dividing the large transformer into three parts for lifting, overcoming the difficulty of the crane's limited capacity. Worker Su Shouquan created the "internal winding method," which doubled the winding efficiency. In addition, the workers also created insulation angle rings and several tools. Therefore, the large transformer, which was originally planned to be trial-produced by the end of June, was completed one month ahead of schedule on May 29. (Xinhua News Agency)

    China's First Gallnut Plastic Factory Starts Production
    The newly built Chongqing Gallnut Plastic Factory, a local state-owned enterprise in Chongqing, started production on March 15. This is China's first plastic factory (commonly known as a bakelite factory) that uses its own raw materials for production.
    The plastics industry is one of the emerging chemical industries in the world, with only over fifty years of history. There are many types of plastics, and they have a wide range of uses. Products made of plastic are resistant to acid, alkali, heat, and electricity. Its greatest use is in the manufacture of electrical equipment, but it can also be used to manufacture various utensils, ornaments, toys, and other daily necessities.
    The raw material for the production of gallnut plastic is Chinese gallnut. The output of Chinese gallnut in southwestern China ranks first in the world. In 1951, the Southwest Financial and Economic Committee hired Professor Xu Xi and others from Chongqing University to study the use of gallnut to manufacture industrial products, and established a Gallnut Plastic Guidance Research Group, led by Professors Xu Xi and Yue Yilun, to conduct research and guide experiments in the Chemical Engineering Department of Chongqing University. After more than a year, they finally succeeded in experimenting with gallnut plastic.
    Currently, the electrical equipment molded by this factory using self-made gallnut plastic has a voltage-withstanding performance nine times higher than that of electrical equipment made of foreign plastic, a melting point six times higher, and a gallnut purity that has reached 98%, exceeding the gallnut purity of the United States and Britain by more than 18%. It is also superior to foreign goods in terms of acid and alkali resistance.

    Shanxi State-Owned Jingwei Textile Machinery Factory Successfully Trial-Produces Rieter Comber
    Shanxi State-Owned Jingwei Textile Machinery Factory has successfully trial-produced the Rieter comber.
    The Rieter comber is an advanced textile machine with many advantages: First, domestic combers generally use belt drives, while the Rieter comber's transmission method mostly uses gears and long shafts, which not only ensures correct relationships between parts and improves efficiency, but is also particularly safe; Second, its transmission gears are concentrated in a gear box, which can adjust the speed and handle head-end failure in a timely manner, reducing cotton waste; Third, the cam track adjustment mechanism is concentrated in a semi-circular wall, reducing a lot of calibration time and saving a lot of labor; Fourth, the cylinder outer diameter is 20% smaller than general ones, the number of flats is 25% less than general ones, and the number of revolutions is 22% higher; Fifth, the machine body is stable and does not vibrate.
    The successful trial production of the Rieter comber is only the beginning of the arduous trial manufacturing work of the Shanxi State-Owned Jingwei Textile Machinery Factory. Currently, the factory's employees are working hard to successfully trial-produce the entire process of spinning machines such as scutchers, drawing frames, roving frames, spinning frames, and spindles.

    Shandong Construction Engineering Company Completes Eighteen Projects
    Shandong Construction Engineering Company has completed eighteen projects. The construction progress of this batch of projects is generally faster than last year. Except for the dormitory projects of the Institute of Technology and Hengtai Match Factory, which were completed a few days late, other projects were completed on schedule or ahead of schedule. The quality of most projects is close to requirements, and some projects have also achieved great results in saving, reducing project costs.
    The main reason why this batch of projects is better than last year is that the majority of construction workers have improved their political awareness and brought their initiative into play during winter training. They found many tricks and put forward rationalization proposals in the competition. For example, workers from the Fifth Construction Team found that placing the concrete mixing board on the platform and pouring the concrete into the wall with a shovel after mixing, eliminated the need for porters and transportation time. As a result, the concrete project in the basement was completed in only twelve hours, twice as fast as originally planned, and the quality was also good. For example, the workers at the Twelfth Construction Team's construction site proposed using cornice walls instead of wooden purlins, saving fifty-eight purlins. Due to the active efforts of the workers, the project progressed rapidly, the quality of the project was also improved, and a large amount of labor and materials were saved.
    Now, the above-mentioned completed construction sites are adjusting their organizations to meet the more arduous tasks in the second half of the year.

    Jiangsu Province Achieves Overall Good Harvest of Spring Silkworm Cocoons
    Jiangsu Province has achieved an overall good harvest of spring silkworm cocoons. Cocoon purchasing stations in various places have begun purchasing.
    This year, silkworm farmers in 42 counties and cities in the spring silkworm cocoon producing areas of Jiangsu Province have generally organized spring silkworm joint rearing groups based on agricultural production mutual aid teams. They widely promoted the high-yield experience of silkworm rearing models and scientific silkworm rearing techniques such as "sparse feeding with sufficient food" and "thin leaves and frequent feeding" through observation meetings and technical exchange meetings. As a result, the silkworm age was generally shortened, the silkworms were physically healthy, and an overall good harvest was achieved. It is estimated that the average unit yield of spring silkworm cocoons in the province this year has increased by 10% compared with last year. Nanlong Village, a silkworm mulberry high-yield village in Wuxi County, increased the amount of cocoons produced per money of silkworm eggs by 20% compared with last year. The collective silkworm rearing group led by Zhong Laomao, a silkworm rearing model in Wu County, originally planned to produce 28 catties of cocoons per money of silkworm eggs, but as a result, they produced 30 catties. The output of spring silkworm cocoons in Jianhu and other counties in northern Jiangsu also increased by more than 20% compared with last year.
    The Jiangsu Provincial People's Government Finance and Economics Committee established a Cocoon Purchasing Office as early as April. From May 28, purchasing stations in various places have successively opened to purchase cocoons. (Xinhua News Agency)

    Xinjiang Province's Aircraft Locust Control is Effective
    Xinjiang Province's aircraft locust control work is effective. From May 22 to 30, in the nine days, the aircraft locust control area has reached 150,000 mu in the locust-stricken areas of Dihua, Shawan, Wusu, Suilai, Qiande, and Yanqi counties. According to on-the-spot inspections in farmland and pastures, it has been proven that 24 hours after spraying powder or poison bait by aircraft, the mortality rate of locusts reaches 80% to 90%. Farmers and herdsmen of all ethnic groups carried flowers to temporary airports to pay tribute to Soviet locust control experts and People's Government locust control technicians. Farmers of all ethnic groups in Sui County also organized condolence groups, bringing chickens, eggs, milk, fresh fruits, etc., to the temporary airport to express their condolences.

    在祖国经济建设的战线上
    东北电工五厂试制大型变压器成功
    东北电工五厂试制六万六千伏特、一万千伏安的大型变压器成功。五月三十一日进行试验，效果良好，质量达到标准要求。这个大型变压器，是按照苏联最先进的标准制造的。它可以供给三个五千人的工厂或二十万人口的城市变电使用。这对于我国迅速发展的工业和当前的基本建设有很大意义。
    东北电工五厂在试制大型变压器的过程中，得到了苏联专家的重大帮助。同时，职工们也发挥了高度的积极性和创造性，找出了很多窍门，解决了设备上和技术上的困难。如大型变压器本身重量有三十五吨，而装配车间只有十五吨的吊车，车间工长赵普俊提出把大型变压器分成三部分来吊，克服了吊车能力小的困难。工人苏守全创造了“里部卷线法”，使卷线效率提高了两倍。此外，工人们还创造了绝缘角环和若干种工具。因此，原计划六月底试制成功的大型变压器，到五月二十九日就提前一个月完成任务。（据新华社讯）
    我国第一个棓酸塑料厂开工生产
    重庆新建的地方国营重庆棓酸塑料厂已于三月十五日开工生产。这是我国第一个用自己的原料进行生产的塑料工厂（即一般说的电木厂）。
    塑料工业是世界上新兴的化学工业之一，至今仅有五十多年的历史。塑料的种类很多，用途广泛，以塑料制成的东西能耐酸、耐碱、抗热、绝电，它的最大用途是制造电工器材，同时还可以制造各种器皿、饰物、玩具等日常用品。
    生产棓酸塑料的原料是我国出产的五棓子。我国西南地区五棓子的产量居世界第一。西南财政经济委员会于一九五一年聘请了重庆大学徐僖教授等研究用五棓子制造工业用品，并成立了棓酸塑料指导研究组，由徐僖、乐以伦两教授负责领导研究工作，并指导重庆大学化工系进行试验。经过一年多的时间，终于将棓酸塑料试验成功。
    目前这个厂用自制的棓酸塑料塑造的电工器材，承电压的效能比外国塑料所制成的电工器材高过九倍，熔点高出六倍，棓酸的纯度已经达到百分之九十八，超过美、英棓酸百分之十八以上，在耐酸、耐碱各方面也比外货优良。
    山西国营经纬纺织机械制造厂试制立达式梳棉机成功
    山西国营经纬纺织机械制造厂试制立达式梳棉机成功。
    立达式梳棉机是一种先进的纺织机器，优点很多：第一、国内一般梳棉机是皮带传动，而立达式梳棉机的传动方法，绝大部分是用齿轮及长轴，这不但使各部关系正确，效率提高，而且特别安全；第二、它的传动齿轮集中在一个齿轮箱内，可以及时调节速度和处理断头故障，减少棉芒浪费；第三、曲轨调节机构集中在半圆墙内，减少很多校准时间，还能节省大量人工；第四、锡林外圆较一般的缩小百分之二十，盖板数量较一般的减少百分之二十五，转数增加百分之二十二；第五、机身稳，没有震动。
    立达式梳棉机试制成功，仅仅是山西国营经纬纺织机械制造厂艰巨的试造工作的开始，目前该厂职工正为试制清花机、并条机、粗纺机、精纺机、纱锭等全程纺纱机的成功而努力。
    山东建筑工程公司十八处工程完工
    山东建筑工程公司已有十八处工程完工。这批工程的施工进度，一般比去年为快。除工学院和恒泰火柴厂的职工宿舍工程延期几天完工外，其他工程都按期或提前完工。大部工程质量接近要求，有些工程在节约方面也收到很大的成绩，降低了工程成本。
    这批工程所以比去年好，主要原因是广大建筑工人在冬训中提高了政治觉悟，发挥了积极性。他们在竞赛中找出了很多窍门和提出合理化建议。如第五施工所工人找出把混凝土搅拌板放在平台上，混凝土搅好后只要用铁铲往墙内灌，省去搬运工人和搬运时间，结果只用十二小时就完成了地下室的混凝土工程，比原计划快了一倍，并且质量也好。又如第十二施工所工地的工人，提出用檐墙代替木檩，节省了五十八根檩条。由于工人们的积极努力，因此工程进展迅速，工程质量也有提高，并节省了大批人工和物料。
    现在，上述完工工地，正在调整机构，以迎接下半年的更加艰巨的任务。
    江苏省春蚕茧全面丰收
    江苏省春蚕茧全面丰收。各地蚕茧收购站已开始进行收购工作。
    今年，江苏省春蚕茧产地四十二个县、市的养蚕农民，普遍以农业生产互助组为基础组织了春蚕共育组。他们运用观摩会、技术交流会等方式，广泛推广养蚕模范的丰产经验和“疏饲饱食”、“薄叶勤喂”等科学养蚕技术，因而蚕龄普遍缩短，蚕儿体质健康，获得了全面丰收。据估计，今年全省春蚕茧单位产量平均比去年增加一成。无锡县蚕桑丰产村——南?村每钱蚁蚕产茧量比去年增加二成。吴县养蚕模范钟老毛领导的集体养蚕组，每钱蚁蚕原计划产茧二十八斤，结果产了三十斤。苏北建湖等县春蚕茧产量也比去年增加二成以上。
    江苏省人民政府财政经济委员会早在四月间就成立了蚕茧收购办公室。五月二十八日起，各地收购站已陆续开秤收茧。（据新华社讯）
    新疆省飞机灭蝗有成效
    新疆省飞机灭蝗工作有成效。从五月二十二日到三十日的九天中，在迪化、沙湾、乌苏、绥来、乾德和焉耆等县蝗灾区，飞机灭蝗面积已达十五万亩。根据农田和牧场中的实地检查，证明飞机喷撒药粉或毒饵二十四小时后，蝗虫死亡率达百分之八十至九十。各民族农民、牧民纷纷携带着鲜花，到临时机场向苏联治蝗专家和人民政府灭蝗技术人员致敬。绥县的各民族农民还组织了慰问团，带着鸡、鸡蛋、牛奶和鲜果等，到临时机场去慰问。
