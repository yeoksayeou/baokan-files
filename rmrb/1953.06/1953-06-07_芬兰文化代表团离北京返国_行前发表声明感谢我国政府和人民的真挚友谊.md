    The Finnish Cultural Delegation visited China for six weeks at the invitation of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs, traveling several thousand kilometers in various places. Everywhere we went, we encountered the most sincere friendship and hospitality. For this, we want to most sincerely thank Chairman Mao, the People's Government, the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs, and everyone who gave us valuable assistance during our journey.

    From countless facts and detailed situations, we were able to see with our own eyes the tremendous changes that have taken place in the Chinese people as a result of winning independence and freedom. We have seen rapid progress in the economic and cultural fields. We were deeply moved by the sincere friendship and respect of the Chinese people for our country and our people in the distance. Everywhere we saw evidence that the Chinese people, in carrying out peaceful construction, are how eager for peace and friendship between all peoples of the world, and are doing everything in their power to defend world peace.

    We wish good health to the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, and hope that he will continue to lead the Chinese people in their tireless advance towards a better life for themselves and the happiness of all mankind for many, many years to come. We hope that the 500 million cultured Chinese people will achieve the greatest victory in realizing their lofty ideals.

    Long live the eternal friendship between the Chinese and Finnish people!
    Long live world peace!
