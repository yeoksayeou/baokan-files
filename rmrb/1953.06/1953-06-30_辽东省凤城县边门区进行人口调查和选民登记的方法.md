Methods for Population Survey and Voter Registration in Bianmen District, Fengcheng County, Liaodong Province
The Liaodong Provincial Election Committee began a pilot project for grassroots general elections in Bianmen District, Fengcheng County, on May 23rd. In the first stage of the pilot, it took about three days to complete the population survey and voter registration for the entire district. The boundaries of who had and did not have civil rights were clearly defined, further enhancing the people of the district's understanding of the importance of civil rights.

Before conducting the population survey and voter registration, Bianmen District widely publicized the significance of the general election and the solemnity of democratic rights. The publicity in general villages was relatively good, but in some villages, the publicity was not deep or thorough enough, so that the masses still did not clearly understand the significance of the population survey. After inspection, and in response to the ideological concerns of the masses, the policies were repeatedly publicized, especially detailed explanations were given on the issue of reporting age truthfully. According to statistics from seventeen villages, 548 people corrected their age during registration. In the publicity, the issue of changing the class status of landlords and former rich peasants was also explained in detail. Initially, cadres and activists from the land reform generally advocated not granting them civil rights; they were even more reluctant to grant changes to landlords who had worked in the reactionary government; and they were unwilling to grant changes to those who often committed minor mistakes or engaged in fighting and cursing. However, some masses who had relatives, friends, or belonged to the same clan as the landlords, such as in Zhangjia Village, advocated that landlords and former rich peasants could completely change their class status. In response to these ideological situations, the standards for changing landlord status were emphasized, explaining why changes were necessary, what benefits would accrue to the consolidation of the people's democratic dictatorship if qualified people were changed, and what harm would result from casually changing the status of those who were not qualified. Through such education, the political consciousness of the masses was further raised, they recognized the solemnity of political rights, and they were very serious and cautious about this work.

Before conducting the population survey and voter registration, Bianmen District made full preparations. The main preparation was the training of election technical cadres. The source of technical cadres was basically local recruitment, because they were local people, familiar with the situation, and convenient for carrying out the work. The training process was that the village election committee first hired some politically reliable people with form-filling ability according to the population ratio (one technical cadre per 500 people), who were instructed by the technical cadres trained in the district, and a member of the election committee was responsible for leading their study, explaining to them the purpose of voter registration, the content of registration, the registration method, and the matters that should be paid attention to in the work, so that they were familiar with the business. They were also given the original household registration books as a reference for familiarizing themselves with the situation. The second was to organize a voter qualification review group. After the review group was formed, the members of the review group were given policy education so that they understood the policies, clarified the standards, and understood the past crimes of those who had been deprived of civil rights and their performance since the land reform. Then, through the symposiums of the party branch, public security and defense team members, and activists, opinions were exchanged on whether to change the class status and whether to continue to deprive civil rights. After the above work was done, the review group personnel and technical cadres were organized according to the electoral districts and the registration areas were divided, and members of the election committee were assigned to be responsible for guidance. Before the universal registration began, a survey and registration were first carried out in one electoral district, learning while doing, discovering problems, and summarizing experience, and then fully unfolding. Experience has proved that this method is applicable to every link in the election work.

The population survey and voter registration of each village in Bianmen District were basically carried out on the basis of small fortresses or courtyards, using the method of "small, flexible, and mobile registration stations," and only for individual addresses that were too scattered or in special circumstances, the method of household visits and registration was adopted. The time for investigation and registration was generally used during production gaps. Some villages registered all day long, which could also work, because most of those who came to register were women, which did not affect the men's production in the fields, but misreporting often occurred. Some villages completely adopted the method of household visits and registration, which was not only inconvenient for the masses, but also could not absorb voters to participate, and the educational effect was not great. Hejia Village rushed to complete the task in one day and one night in order to save trouble, which made the masses dissatisfied and made many mistakes, messing up the entire register.

According to the experience of Bianmen District, there are three ways to conduct voter registration and population surveys. One is: after the population registration is completed for the general basic masses, voters are registered and voter certificates are issued. For landlord elements, after the review group decides that they have civil rights, voter registration is carried out on the spot and voter certificates are issued; those who do not have civil rights are told the reasons why they are not given voter certificates. If they disagree with the opinion of the review group, they can be told to appeal to the election committee and the people's court. This is not only fast and prudent, but also can obtain the supervision and assistance of the masses, and the masses can further realize the solemnity of voter rights and the importance of voter certificates. This is how Laoyemiao Village did it. After the registration was completed, it also separately convened meetings of landlord elements who had obtained civil rights and those who had not obtained civil rights according to electoral districts (and absorbed active members of the masses to participate) to educate them and encourage them to strive for progress. However, adopting this method requires the above preparations to be done before the population survey.

Another method is: basic masses carry out voter registration and receive voter certificates at the same time as population registration; landlord elements and other people deprived of civil rights only carry out population registration, not voter registration, and another meeting is convened to review their civil rights. For example, in Renhe Village, after the population survey and voter registration of the general masses, the review group was responsible for convening a voter meeting in the electoral district in the evening to discuss and review the civil rights of landlord elements, and submit the review opinions to the election committee for approval, and then announce them and explain the reasons. Those who are granted civil rights will be registered on the spot and issued voter certificates; those who are not granted civil rights will also be shown the way out. This approach has great educational significance.

Another method is: first carry out population registration, then carry out voter registration for the general masses, issue voter certificates, and finally convene a voter meeting to review landlord elements and decide whether to grant them civil rights. The effect of this approach is not as good as the previous two.

In order to make the population survey and voter registration work accurate and practical, most villages in Bianmen District conducted a comprehensive review or a key sampling inspection after the registration was completed, and found many problems. The main problems were more errors in age, ethnicity, and the distinction between permanent residents and people outside the area. There were also many omissions. The reasons are: some villages did not pay enough attention, the education of technical personnel was poor, they simply wanted to complete the task, only seeking speed, not accuracy, and some even copied the original household registration books; the education of the masses was also insufficient, and the masses were not given enough attention.

    辽东省凤城县边门区进行人口调查和选民登记的方法
    辽东省选举委员会从五月二十三日开始，在凤城县边门区进行了基层普选典型试办工作。在试办的第一阶段，大约用了三天时间，完成了全区的人口调查和选民登记。划清了谁有公民权谁无公民权的界限，使该区人民进一步认识了公民权利的重要意义。
    边门区在进行人口调查、选民登记工作之前，对普选的意义和民主权利的庄严性，进行了广泛的宣传。一般的村都宣传得较好，但也有的村宣传得不深不透，使群众对人口调查的意义仍然认识不清。经检查以后，又针对群众的思想顾虑，反复宣传了政策，特别对实报年龄的问题作了详尽的解释，据十七个村统计，在登记时更正年龄的有五百四十八人。在宣传中，对于改变地主、旧富农分子的成份问题，也作了详细解释。开始，干部和土地改革时的积极分子，多数主张不给他们公民权利；对在反动政府做过事的地主更不愿给改变；对那些常犯小毛病、打仗骂人的，也不愿给改。但有些与地主分子有亲戚、朋友关系和同一宗族的群众，如张家村，则主张地主、旧富农分子可以完全改变成份。针对这些思想情况，着重讲解了改变地主成份的标准，为什么要改变，够条件的改变对巩固人民民主专政有什么好处，不够条件就马马虎虎给改变有什么坏处。通过这样的教育，群众的政治觉悟进一步提高了，认识了政治权利的庄严性，对这一工作十分认真慎重。
    边门区在进行人口调查和选民登记之前，作了充分的准备工作。主要是对选举技术干部的培养和训练做了准备，技术干部的来源，基本上采取就地取材的办法。因为他们是本地人，熟悉情况，进行工作方便。训练的过程是先由村选举委员会按人口比例（每五百人一名技术干部），聘请一些政治上可靠、有填表能力的人，由在区里受过训练的技术干部进行传授，并由一选举委员会委员负责领导他们学习，向他们讲解选民登记的目的，登记内容，登记方法以及工作中应注意的事项等，使他们熟悉业务。并把原户口簿交给他们，作为熟悉情况的参考。第二是组织选民资格审查小组。审查小组组成后，对审查小组成员进行了政策教育，使他们懂得政策，明确标准，并弄清过去被剥夺公民权的人的罪恶事实以及自土地改革以来的表现，然后通过党支部、治安保卫小组人员和积极分子的座谈会，交换应否改变成份和应否继续剥夺公民权的意见。以上工作做好后，即将审查小组人员和技术干部按选区编好划分登记区域，由选举委员会委员分工负责指导。在普遍开始登记前，首先在一个选区进行调查登记，边做边学，发现问题，总结经验，然后全面铺开。经验证明，这样的方法，适用于选举工作中的每一个环节。
    边门区各村的人口调查和选民登记，基本上是以小堡子或以院落为单位，采用“小型的、灵活的、游动性的登记站”的办法进行的，仅对个别住址太分散或情形特殊的，采取逐户访查登记的办法。调查、登记的时间，一般是利用生产空隙。有的村是整天进行登记，这样做也能行得通，因到场登记的多是妇女，不影响男人下地生产，但常发生误报现象。有的村完全采取逐户访查登记的方法，结果是既不便利群众，又不能吸收选民参加，教育作用也不大。赫家村因为图省事赶任务，突击了一天一夜，群众不满，且差错很多，把整个表册搞乱了。
    据边门区的经验，进行选民登记和人口调查的办法有三种。一种是：对一般基本群众，在人口登记完后，即登记选民，并填发选民证。对地主分子，经过审查小组决定，有公民权的当场进行选民登记，填发选民证；无公民权的即对其说明不给选民证的理由，如本人不同意审查小组的意见，可告诉他向选举委员会和人民法庭申诉。这样做不仅迅速慎重，且可以取得群众的监督和协助，群众也能从中进一步认识到选民权利的庄严性与选民证的重要。老爷庙村就是这样做的，登记完后，还按选区分别召集得到公民权和没得到公民权的地主分子开会（并吸收群众积极分子参加），向他们进行教育，鼓励他们力求进步。但采用这种办法，在人口调查前必须做好上述准备工作。
    另一种是：基本群众在人口登记同时，也进行选民登记，领选民证；地主分子和其他被剥夺公民权利的人，则只进行人口登记，不进行选民登记，另外召集会议，审查他们的公民权。如人和村，在人口调查、一般群众进行选民登记之后，由审查小组负责在晚间召集本选区的选民会议，讨论审查地主分子等的公民权，将审查意见报选举委员会批准，然后公布，并说明原因。对给予公民权的，当场登记，发给选民证；不给公民权的，也向他们指明出路。这种做法教育意义很大。
    再一种办法是：先进行人口登记，然后再进行一般群众的选民登记，填发选民证，最后召开选民会议审查地主分子，决定给不给他们公民权。这种做法的效果，不如前两种。
    为使人口调查、选民登记工作做到切实准确，边门区大部分村在结束登记后进行了全面复查或重点抽查，结果发现很多问题。主要是年龄、民族、常住人口与在外人口的区分的差错较多。遗漏的也不少。原因是：有的村重视不够，对技术人员教育差，单纯为了完成任务，只求快，不求准确，甚至有的照原户口册子抄一下；对群众教育也不够，没引起群众的重视。（辽东省选举委员会）
