Two Letters, One Heart

I. Dear Volunteer Army Uncle Huang Jiafu:

I am a little farm girl named Yang Shiying from Miaogou, Minxian County, Gansu Province. There are five people in my family: my father, mother, older brother, sister-in-law, and me. Before liberation, we lived in hunger and tears. After liberation, our lives have been getting better day by day, and I can also study at the village school. My father tells everyone, "If it weren't for Chairman Mao, we wouldn't have what we have today!" I often think, "If it weren't for Chairman Mao, I wouldn't be able to study, wouldn't know how to make an embroidered pouch for you, and you wouldn't write to me from so far away in Korea!"

I remember it was in the autumn of the year before last. Chairman Mao's cadres came to our village and told everyone about the atrocities of the American devils in Korea and the story of the Volunteer Army uncles saving Korean children, which moved me deeply. One sentence I will never forget. They said, "If it weren't for the Volunteer Army comrades protecting our motherland and children, the children of the motherland would suffer the same tragic fate as the Korean children!" Later, I often saw various photos of the Volunteer Army uncles in pictorials, and heard stories of your heroic battles from teachers at school. The more I learned, the more I felt that the heroic uncles were so great and so lovable.

From then on, I often wondered: what can I do to express my feelings for the Volunteer Army uncles? Money? The Volunteer Army uncles don't have to worry about food or clothing. Towels and sweets? Not good enough. Later, I saw the aunts and aunties in our village were making embroidered pouches for you, with all sorts of patterns. I thought I would also make an embroidered pouch for you. Firstly, you could use it to hold needles and thread, and secondly, I could embroider all my love and admiration for you on it. Once I made up my mind, I gave the money I had saved to my father and asked him to buy some patterned cloth and thread for me. I also asked my sister-in-law to help me cut out the pattern and match the colors. It took me three days to make it. But the more I looked at it, the more I felt it was not good enough. If I made another one, it would take several more days. What if everyone else sent theirs away! Later, I thought: the pouch may not be good, but my heart is there. As long as I embroider my name on it, and let the Volunteer Army uncles know that this was sent to him by a child of the motherland, he would definitely like it. So, I put it together with the many embroidered pouches made by the aunties and aunties in the village and sent it to the front lines in Korea. From that day on, I often thought: when will the embroidered pouch be delivered to the hands of the heroic uncles!

Finally, the good news came. On November 30th last year, the *People's Daily*'s "Resist America, Aid Korea" special issue published a Korean dispatch entitled "Demolitionist and Embroidered Pouch." The article said that my embroidered pouch was delivered to you and encouraged you to bravely engage in battle. In just one battle in which our army launched a counterattack against the enemy west of Guandal里, you alone completed fifteen consecutive demolition missions, annihilating more than two hundred enemies, and won the glorious title of "First-Class Demolition Hero." This January, when the Second Chinese People's Delegation to Korea came to Minxian County to report, they also told me this news. They even came to my home and personally handed me the letter you wrote to me and gave me many books and newspapers. Later, Comrade Miao, the County Party Secretary of our county, and Comrade Wang, the County Magistrate, also gave me many towels and sweets, and invited me to dinner and took photos... I feel like I'm dreaming! A comrade named Feng Yousong, who lives in the Northeast, saw the article "Demolitionist and Embroidered Pouch" in the newspaper and specially sent me a statue of Chairman Mao, which was given to him by a Volunteer Army air force friend. He also wrote in the letter: "Given to Yang Shiying, the good daughter of the motherland!"

Uncle, all of this moves me deeply, and makes me know that every stitch and thread from the motherland will add to the combat power of the uncles. This time, I asked my father to buy two pairs of socks, put soles on them, and embroidered flowers on them. I also enclosed a photo of myself with the letter to you, hoping that you will fight more heroically and strive for greater victory. As for me, I will study harder and strive to write a letter to you in my own handwriting within a year. My father and brother also said: from now on, we will work even harder to produce and support the uncles in defending our country!

II. Dear Sister Yang Shiying:

When I received your letter, photo, and socks embroidered with bright flowers this time, it was no longer in the fighting Korea, but in the heart of the motherland—Beijing. I received your letter and precious gifts not long after I came to Beijing to participate in the Volunteer Army's "May Day" National Day Observation Delegation. It's truly a "double blessing!" Seeing your smiling face in the photo is like seeing all the happy children of the motherland. I read your letter over and over again, and was moved to tears many times.

On "May Day," we saw our Chairman Mao on the reviewing stand in front of Tiananmen Square. His health is so strong, it is truly the greatest happiness for the Chinese people and gives us the greatest comfort. The slogan "Long live Chairman Mao" is too familiar, but shouting it at this time feels particularly meaningful. That day, 500,000 people passed by Tiananmen Square under our reviewing stand, including workers, farmers, students, and cadres. They all waved red flags, held flowers, and shouted "Long live Chairman Mao" and "Long live the Volunteer Army." That day, members of the Korean Democratic People's Republic's visiting Railway Art Troupe, the Mongolian People's Republic's Art Troupe, and the Polish People's Republic's Mazowsze Song and Dance Ensemble also participated in our parade and cheered and waved to us in the same way. At that time, I thought: "With so many people in the motherland supporting us, and so many peace-loving people in the world supporting us, how can we fail to resist America and aid Korea?"

In Beijing, we also gave many reports to workers, farmers, and students. Everywhere we went, we were warmly welcomed by the masses. Many times, we were lifted up and cheered by people. I remember in Fengtai, four children wearing red scarves ran up to me, shook my hand warmly, hugged me, kissed me, and called me "Volunteer Army Uncle" one after another. Finally, they put their red scarves around my neck. Sister Shiying, can you guess what I said to the children at that time? I didn't say anything. It felt like something was stuck in my throat, and I couldn't speak, and I just wanted to cry. When I saw these innocent, lively, and enthusiastic children, I couldn't help but think of the equally lovely Korean children. In Suguo里, Changdao Township, lived an old woman named Park. She had five children—three boys and two girls, the oldest was only fifteen years old, and four were studying at school. As soon as they came back from school, they would run to our barracks to play, sing and dance for us, and call us "吉温棍董姆!" (Volunteer Army Comrades!) We also often helped Old Woman Park and the children carry water, shovel grass, feed the cattle, and hoe the land... But, an unfortunate thing happened. One night, just as the children came back from school and were eating dinner prepared for them by their mother, an enemy shell flew over and hit their house. The house was destroyed, and Old Woman Park and her five children said goodbye to us forever. The misfortune of their whole family brought us so much grief and anger! Comrades who had never shed tears before all cried until their eyes were red. With tears in our eyes, we convened party branch, youth league branch, and class discussion meetings, and decided to avenge Old Woman Park and her children, and to protect the thousands of small lives in the motherland. Today, seeing these children in Beijing who can put red scarves around my neck, how can I not be both excited and grieved? I feel that my blood has not been shed in vain, and I will fight more heroically to protect their happy lives forever!

Dear Sister Shiying, there are too many things I have seen, heard, moved, and educated me in Beijing to describe them all at once. What else should I say to you? I can only assure you again: maintain glory, kill more enemies, and strive for more merit! At the same time, I hope that you can study hard and become a useful talent for the construction of the motherland in the future. This time in Beijing, the Chinese People's Resist America, Aid Korea General Association gave me a Jin Xing fountain pen, as well as a beautiful diary, ten art postcards, and photos I took in Beijing, all given to you by the people of the motherland, as a souvenir!

    两封信  一条心
    一亲爱的志愿军黄家富叔叔：
    我是住在甘肃省岷县庙沟的一个农家小姑娘，叫杨世英。家中共五口人：爹、妈、哥哥、嫂嫂和我。解放前，我们的日子都是在饥饿和眼泪中度过的，解放后，生活才一天天地好起来，我也能在村里的小学校念书了。爹见人就说：“要不是毛主席，我们那有今天！”我也常想：“要不是毛主席，我那能念书，那能知道给叔叔做绣花荷包，叔叔也不会从那么远的朝鲜给我写信呀！”
    记得是前年秋天吧，毛主席的干部到我们村上来，给大家讲了美国鬼子在朝鲜的暴行和志愿军叔叔救朝鲜小孩的故事，很使我感动。有一句话我永远也不会忘记。他们说：“要不是志愿军同志保卫着我们的祖国和孩子，祖国的孩子们也会遭到和朝鲜孩子同样的悲惨命运！”后来，我又常常在画报上看到志愿军叔叔的各种照片，在学校里听老师讲你们英勇战斗的故事，越来我越觉得英雄的叔叔们太伟大，太可爱了。
    从此，我就常想：用什么办法来表达自己对志愿军叔叔的心意呢？钱吧，志愿军叔叔不愁吃不愁穿的；毛巾、糖果吧，也不够好。后来看到我们村上的姨姨和婶婶们，都在给叔叔赶制绣花荷包，什么花样都有，我想我也给叔叔做个绣花荷包吧，一来叔叔可以用它来装针线，二来还能把我爱慕你们的心意全都绣在上面。主意一拿定，我就把自己攒下来的钱交给爹，叫他代我买一些花布和花线来，又央请嫂嫂帮我剪样子、配颜色，化了三天功夫，把它做成了。可是我看来看去，总觉得不好。再做一个吧，又得好几天，人家的都送走了怎么办！后来我想：荷包不好，心意全在，只要绣上我的名字，让志愿军叔叔知道这是祖国的孩子送给他的，他一定会很喜欢的。就这样，我把它和全村婶婶姨姨们做的许多绣花荷包放在一起，寄到朝鲜前线了。打那天起，我就常常想着：绣花荷包什么时候才能够送到英雄叔叔们的手中呢！
    好消息终于传来了。去年十一月三十日人民日报
    “抗美援朝专刊”上，登了一篇“爆破手和绣花荷包”的朝鲜通讯，文中说我的那个绣花荷包送到了你的手中，还鼓舞着你英勇地投入了战斗。仅在我军向官岱里以西的敌人发起反击的一次战斗中，叔叔你一个人就完成了连续十五次的爆破任务，一人歼灭了敌人二百多名，并获得了“一级爆破英雄”的光荣称号。今年元月，中国人民第二届赴朝慰问团到岷县做传达报告的时候，又把这个消息告诉了我，他们还亲自到我家里来了一趟，把你给我写的信亲手递给我，并送给了我许多书籍和报纸。以后，我们县里的县委书记苗叔叔和县长王叔叔，也送给了我许多毛巾和糖果，又请我吃饭、照像……，我觉得这都好像在做梦一样！远在东北的一个冯友松同志，在报纸上看到了“爆破手和绣花荷包”的文章后，特地给我寄来了一个毛主席的塑像，这是他的一个志愿军空军朋友赠给他的。他还在信上写着：“转赠给祖国的好女儿杨世英！”
    叔叔啊，这一切都使我深受感动，使我知道了祖国的一针一线都会给叔叔们增添着战斗的力量。这次，我又托爹买了两双袜子，上了底，绣了花，和我的一张照片随信寄给叔叔，希望叔叔更英勇地战斗，争取更大的胜利。我呢，要更加努力学习，争取在一年内能给叔叔亲笔写信。爹和哥哥也说：今后要更加劲地生产，支援叔叔们保家卫国呢！

    二亲爱的杨世英妹妹：
    我这次接到你的信、像片和绣着鲜艳花朵的袜子，已经不是在战斗的朝鲜，而是在祖国的心脏——北京了。我参加志愿军“五一”节归国观礼代表团来到北京不久，就接到你的来信和珍贵礼品，真是“双喜临门”啊！从像片上，看到了你的笑脸，就好像看到祖国所有幸福的孩子一样。你的来信我也是读了又读，好几次被感动得淌下眼泪来。
    “五一”节那天，我们在天安门前的观礼台上看到了咱们的毛主席。他老人家的身体那么健壮，真是中国人民的最大幸福，也使我们得到了最大安慰。“毛主席万岁”这口号喊得太熟了，但在这时喊起来，特别觉得有意义。那天，有五十万人在天安门前，在我们的观礼台下边通过，有工人、有农民、有学生、有干部，他们都打着红旗，举着鲜花，喊着“毛主席万岁”、“志愿军万岁”。那一天，还有朝鲜民主主义人民共和国访华铁道艺术团、蒙古人民共和国艺术团、波兰人民共和国玛佐夫舍歌舞团的团员们，也参加了我们的游行队伍，他们同样地向我们欢呼和招手。当时我想：“有这么多祖国人民支援我们，有这么多世界爱好和平的人民支援我们，抗美援朝还能不胜利吗？”
    在北京，我们还向工人、农民、学生作了很多报告。每到一个地方，都受到了群众的热烈欢迎。有很多次我们被人们抬起来欢呼。记得在丰台，四个戴着红领巾的孩子跑到我的跟前，和我亲热的握手，抱我，吻我，一句接一句地叫着“志愿军叔叔”，最后，他们把自己的红领巾戴到我的脖子上。世英妹妹，你猜我当时对孩子们说了些什么呢？啥也没说，喉咙上好像塞了块什么东西，说不出话来，直想流泪。我看到这些天真活泼热情的孩子，就不由得想起了和这些孩子同样可爱的朝鲜的孩子们。在昌道面苏国里，住着一个朴老大娘，她有五个孩子——三个男孩，两个女孩，最大的才十五岁，四个都在学校里念书。他们一下学回来，就跑到我们营房里来玩，给我们唱歌、跳舞，叫我们
    “吉温棍董姆！”（志愿军同志！）我们也常常帮助朴老大娘和孩子们抬水、铲草、喂牛、锄地……。可是，不幸的事情发生了。一个夜晚，孩子们刚下学回来，吃着妈妈给他们准备好了的晚饭，敌人的一个炮弹飞来，正打在他们的房子上，房子被炸毁了，朴老大娘和她的五个孩子就这样和我们永别了。他们全家的不幸，给我们带来了多大的悲痛和愤怒啊！从来没有掉过泪的同志都哭红了眼睛。我们含着泪召开了党小组、团小组和班的讨论会，决定要给朴老大娘和她的孩子报仇，要保卫祖国的千万个小生命。今天，在北京看到了这些能给我亲手戴红领巾的孩子们，我怎么能不一面兴奋又一面悲痛呢？我觉着我的鲜血没有白流，我要更英勇地战斗来保卫他们永远幸福地生活下去！
    亲爱的世英妹妹，在北京我所看到的、听到的、感动了我教育了我的事情太多了，一下也说不完。我还应该对你说些什么呢？只有再次向你保证：保持光荣，多杀敌人，争取功上加功！同时也希望你能够努力学习，将来成为建设祖国的有用人才。这次在北京，中国人民抗美援朝总会赠给我一支金星钢笔，还有祖国人民送给我的一本漂亮的日记本、十张美术明信片和我在北京拍的照片，都寄给你，作为纪念吧！
