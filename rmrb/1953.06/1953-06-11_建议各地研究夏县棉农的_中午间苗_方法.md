    Suggest All Regions Study the "Midday Thinning" Method of Cotton Farmers in Xia County
    Zhang Siduan of the North China Agricultural Science Research Institute writes: Most cotton fields are now in the thinning stage. As the saying goes, "Thinning early by an inch is better than applying fertilizer." However, some cotton farmers cannot accurately distinguish between diseased and pest-infested seedlings and strong seedlings, fearing a lack of seedlings in the future, and advocate for "late thinning." This practice is detrimental to cotton seedlings. In Xia County, Shanxi, I discovered the "midday thinning" method of cotton farmers, which can overcome the above difficulties.
    After being exposed to the hot sun, cotton seedlings with roots affected by diseases and pests, or those sown too deep or too shallow with few lateral roots, will gradually begin to wilt around 10:00 AM and only return to normal around 4:00 PM. Healthy cotton seedlings without diseases and pests do not exhibit this phenomenon. Therefore, cotton farmers in Xia County use this pattern of midday cotton seedling wilting and non-wilting to remove bad cotton seedlings early, promoting the early development of good cotton seedlings to increase cotton production. It is hoped that all regions will pay attention to researching and implementing this method.

### 建议各地研究夏县棉农的“中午间苗”方法

    建议各地研究夏县棉农的“中午间苗”方法
    华北农业科学研究所张四端来信：现在大部棉田正在间苗时期，俗话说：“早间一寸，胜似上粪”。但有些棉农由于不能准确地分辨已经发生病虫害的和发育健壮的棉苗的区别，唯恐将来缺苗，就主张“晚定苗”。这种做法对棉苗是不利的。我在山西夏县发现棉农的“中午间苗”方法，能克服上述困难。
    棉苗经过炎热的阳光照晒后，凡是根部受过病虫侵袭或播种过深过浅、生支根少种种发育不良的棉苗，到上午十时便开始逐渐呈凋萎，约到下午四时才能恢复常态；而无病虫害的、发育健壮的棉苗则没有这种现象。因此夏县棉农就利用中午棉苗凋萎、不凋萎这一规律，及早把坏棉苗间去，促进好棉苗提早发育，以增加棉花的产量。希望各地注意研究并试行。
