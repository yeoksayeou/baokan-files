    "American Soldiers Forbidden"
    Huang Gang
    In early March of this year, Japanese people living near American military bases held a meeting of student parents and teacher representatives from more than twenty American military bases across the country to protect children's education. They protested the negative impact of the American military's licentious behavior on children and raised the issue of the "noisy sounds" of American bombers and jeeps being harmful to children's education. The American and Japanese ruling groups, attempting to quell this rising anger among the masses, have reluctantly designated the school areas near American military bases in Japan as areas where "American soldiers are forbidden."
    "American Soldiers Forbidden" – this indicates a practical progress in the struggle of the Japanese people. If "American soldiers are forbidden" in school areas, then this accurately marks the nature of the American army; it indicates that wherever American troops go, they are incompatible with cultural and educational endeavors, with the requirements of peace and health; wherever American troops are stationed: venereal disease and prostitutes follow, young girls dare not approach the American barracks, military trucks can drive over the heads of children at any time, every mother worries about the youth of her children, and every teacher is angered by the loss of moral standards! Thus: "American Soldiers Forbidden," vividly portrays the nature of the American army itself as spreading sin; the American army is a plague to children, who can say it isn't?
    "Yankees, go home!" This is the angry voice of the Japanese people, and we believe they will gradually achieve complete victory.

    “禁止美军入内”
    黄钢
    今年三月初，居住在美军基地附近的日本人民，为着保卫儿童教育，开了一个全国二十多处美军基地的学生家长和教师代表的会议，抗议美军放荡行为对儿童的恶劣影响，提出美军轰炸机和吉普车“嘈杂的声音”对儿童教育有害的问题。美、日统治集团企图平息群众中这种日益高涨的愤怒，迫不得已，现已将日本美军基地附近的学校区域，指定为“禁止美军入内”的范围。
    “禁止美军入内”——这表明了日本人民斗争中的一个实际进展。既是在学校区域“禁止美军入内”，那么，这也就恰到好处地标示出美国军队的性质；这是标示出；美军足迹所到之处，与文化教育事业、与安静和健康的要求，是势不两立的；凡是美军驻留的地方：花柳病和妓女就跟踪而至，少女们从不敢走近美军的兵营，军用卡车随时会开过儿童的头顶，每一个母亲会为着孩子们的青春而忧虑，每一个教员都激愤于道德标准的丧失！于是：“禁止美军入内”，这就活画出美军本身散布罪恶的性质；美军对于儿童就是瘟疫，谁能说不是呢？
    “美国佬，滚回家去！”这是日本人民愤怒声音，相信他们会逐步得到完全的胜利。
