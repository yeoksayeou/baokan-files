The CPC Teng County Committee of Shandong Province has achieved significant results in leading the masses to rescue disaster victims, and has gained some experience in leading the masses to fight against natural disasters.

In mid-April, the Teng County area was hit by a cold wave, and wheat suffered severe damage. More than 1.83 million mu of wheat in the area suffered varying degrees of frost damage, accounting for 36.8 percent of the area's wheat fields. The wheat seedlings that were not directly damaged were also greatly affected and temporarily stopped growing. After the frost disaster, the farmers' enthusiasm for production was severely hit, and their thinking was once extremely chaotic, which greatly affected wheat field management and spring sowing.

The CPC Teng County Committee and the Teng County Commissioner's Office correctly assessed this serious situation, immediately issued emergency instructions, and sent inspection teams deep into the disaster areas to express their condolences to the masses. They also held discussions with experienced farmers and experimented with rescue measures. On April 18, they held an emergency meeting of county heads and leaders of the spring plowing production inspection teams dispatched by the prefectural committee to various counties, and determined that rescuing wheat, overcoming disasters, and ensuring the success of spring plowing and sowing were the overriding central tasks at present. At the same time, they analyzed the importance and favorable conditions for overcoming disasters, adopted rescue measures such as watering wheat, hoeing wheat, applying topdressing fertilizer, replanting, and interplanting, and organized all available forces to participate in the wheat rescue campaign. They also instructed relevant departments to vigorously serve this central task and to postpone or suspend work that could be delayed or suspended. They also particularly emphasized the spirit of fighting against bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of laws and discipline in this campaign, and changing leadership style and work style. After the meeting, the counties dispatched a total of 556 cadres (80 dispatched by the prefectural committee) to go deep into the countryside. In half a month, great achievements were made. The morale of the masses shifted from chaos to stability, and they actively rescued the wheat. According to incomplete statistics, the entire area (excluding Pingyi County) watered 167,186 mu of wheat and hoeed 437,066 mu of wheat. Five counties dug 737 new wells, sold 861 waterwheels, and applied 278,517 jin of chemical fertilizer (excluding Fushan County). Xuecheng and Teng County replanted 818 mu of early-maturing crops. In addition, small rains fell in some areas, and most of the disaster-stricken wheat seedlings turned green and sprouted. At that time, it was estimated that the average wheat yield would be reduced by about 50 percent. Now, according to typical investigations, the wheat harvest in the entire area can reach 60 to 70 percent.

In leading the masses to rescue frozen wheat, the Teng County Committee realized that this was an arduous and meticulous political mobilization and organizational work, a process of educating the masses to believe in science and establish the confidence that "man can conquer nature," and a task that required the mobilization of the entire population and had strict time constraints. In the process of completing such an arduous task, a better leadership method combining point and area was used. After the frost disaster occurred, the masses' superstitious and conservative ideas were deepened. When the masses were pessimistic and disappointed, they urgently demanded leadership, saying, "Why doesn't Chairman Mao come up with an idea?" But on the other hand, due to heavier superstitious and conservative ideas, they did not accept rescue measures such as watering wheat, hoeing wheat, and applying topdressing fertilizer. Some farmers said, "It won't work even if you water sesame oil," "Well water will kill the wheat," "Heaven is in charge, how can people stop it?" At this time, typical examples must be used to educate the masses in order to quickly mobilize the masses.

First of all, they strengthened ideological education for Party members and League members, so that Party members and League members took the lead in action and influenced the masses. Party members and League members took the lead themselves or persuaded their families to take the lead in watering wheat, and many masses followed suit. The prefectural committee and county committee concentrated their efforts to go deep into the countryside, starting from typical examples based on the actual situation of the disaster, the mass base, and objective conditions, to mobilize the masses and launch the campaign. Leading cadres at all levels of the prefectural committee, county, and district personally went deep into villages, groups, households, and even typical figures to hold discussions and visit disaster relief experiences, set an example, and promote the general, so that the wheat rescue campaign gradually unfolded from points to areas. Wang Jiayi, an organization cadre in the Third District of Fushan County, discovered the experience of farmer Yang Fengwen in Dongguo Township watering wheat and sprouting, so he introduced it to the masses and organized them to visit. After the masses visited, they believed that watering wheat could indeed make the frozen wheat seedlings turn green and sprout, so they actively took action. As of April 26, the entire township had dug three wells (there were 16 existing wells) and four water pits, mobilizing 146 households to water 112 mu of wheat. After the masses of Chenzhuang in Qufu County visited the example of the mutual aid team leader applying fertilizer to the frozen wheat fields, making the frozen wheat turn green and sprout, they generally applied fertilizer.

Carrying out the campaign on the basis of mutual assistance and cooperation can make the development of the campaign more extensive and rapid. Because the organized farmers accept new things faster than individual farmers, and once they take action, it is several households or dozens of households, so the impact is great and the persuasiveness is strong. After 38 mutual aid teams in Zhuangtou Township, Seventh District of Teng County, acted one after another, Zhang Zhenglang, an individual household who had always opposed watering wheat, said anxiously, "We can't delay, we have to water quickly!" Tian Zhenju's mutual aid team in Shilipu Township, Eleventh District of the county, watered more than 6 mu of wheat in one day, driving 53 households in the township to quickly water 155 mu of wheat.

In addition, relevant departments also implemented the spirit of opposing bureaucracy, opposing commandism, and opposing violations of laws and discipline in their actual work, reversing the old style of non-cooperation and waiting for the masses to come to them. They were able to actively serve this central task, and loans and material supplies were unprecedentedly timely, which not only strengthened the relationship with the masses, but also developed business.

    中共山东滕县地委领导群众救灾有成绩
    在和自然灾害作斗争中有效地运用典型推动一般
    中共山东滕县地方委员会领导农民抢救受冻小麦有显著的成绩，并且取得了领导群众与自然灾害作斗争的一些经验。
    滕县地区四月中旬受寒流侵袭，小麦遭到严重摧残。全区约有一百八十三万余亩小麦受到了轻重不同的冻灾，占全区麦田面积的百分之三十六点八。未被直接冻坏的麦苗也受到极大影响，曾一时停止发育。冻灾发生后，农民生产情绪受到严重打击，思想一度极为混乱，使麦田加工和春季播种工作都受到很大影响。
    中共滕县地委、滕县专署正确估计了这种严重情况，即时发出了紧急指示，派出检查组深入灾区慰问群众，并与老农座谈，试验抢救。四月十八日又召开了县长和地委派赴各县的春耕生产检查组长的紧急会议，确定了以抢救小麦、战胜灾害、保证搞好春耕春种为当前压倒一切的中心任务。同时分析了战胜灾害的重要意义和有利条件，采取了浇麦、锄麦、追肥和补种、间种的抢救办法，组织了所有可以组织的力量投入救麦运动；并责成有关部门大力为这个中心任务服务，把可以缓、停的工作都缓、停下来。他们并且特别强调了在这一运动中贯彻反对官僚主义、反对命令主义和反对违法乱纪的斗争精神，改变领导作风和工作作风。会后各县共抽调了五百五十六名干部（地委抽调八十名）深入乡村；半个月中，做出了很大成绩。群众情绪由混乱转向稳定，积极抢救了小麦。据不完全统计：全专区浇麦（缺平邑县）十六万七千一百八十六亩，锄麦四十三万七千零六十六亩；五个县新打井七百三十七眼，推销水车八百六十一部，施化学肥料（缺凫山县）二十七万八千五百十七斤。薛城、滕县补种早熟作物八百十八亩。再加部分地区落了小雨，受灾小麦大部返青发芽。当时估计小麦平均要减产五成左右；现根据典型调查，全区小麦收成可达六七成。
    滕县地委在领导群众抢救受冻小麦中，认识到这是个艰苦细致的政治动员工作和组织工作，是教育群众相信科学、树立“人定胜天”的信心的过程，是要全民发动而且带有严格的时间性的任务。在完成这样一个艰巨的任务的过程中，较好地运用了点面结合的领导方法。冻灾发生后，群众迷信保守思想更加深了。群众悲观失望时，迫切要求领导，说：“毛主席怎么还不出主意？”但另一方面，由于迷信保守思想较重，他们又不接受浇麦、锄麦和追肥等抢救办法。有的农民说：“浇香油也不行”， “井水浇地凉死麦”，“老天爷当家，人哪能挡住天？”这时，必须用典型实例来教育群众，才能把群众迅速发动起来。
    他们首先对党员、团员加强了思想教育，使党员、团员带头行动，影响群众。由党员、团员自己带头或说服家庭带头浇麦，许多群众也跟着行动起来。地委、县委都集中力量深入农村，根据灾情、群众基础、客观条件等实际情况，从典型做起，发动群众，开展运动。地委和县、区各级领导干部，都亲自深入到村、组、户以至典型人物，座谈与访问救灾经验，作出样子，推动一般，使抢救小麦的运动逐步由点到面地展开。凫山县三区组织干事王家义，发现了东郭乡农民杨丰文浇麦发芽的经验，就向群众介绍，并组织群众参观。群众参观后相信了浇麦确实能使受冻的麦苗返青发芽，便积极行动起来。至四月二十六日止，全乡挖了三眼井（原有十六眼井）、四个水坑，发动了一百四十六户，浇麦一百十二亩。曲阜县陈庄群众参观了互助组长在受冻的麦田里施肥田粉，使冻麦返青发芽的实例后，便普遍施了肥田粉。
    以互助合作为基础来开展运动，可使运动的发展更加广泛迅速。因为组织起来的农民在接受新事物上较单干农民快，而且一行动就是几户、几十户，因此影响大，说服力强。滕县七区庄头乡三十八个互助组相继行动起来以后，急得一向反对浇麦的单干户张正郎说：“不能迟延了，得快浇啦！”该县十一区十里铺乡田振举互助组一天浇麦六亩多，带动全乡五十三户迅速浇麦一百五十五亩。
    此外，各有关部门在实际工作中也贯彻了反对官僚主义、反对命令主义、反对违法乱纪的精神，扭转了互不配合，坐待群众上门的旧作风，都能积极地为这一中心工作服务，贷款和物资供应空前及时，既密切了和群众的关系，又开展了业务。
