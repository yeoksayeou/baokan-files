    Suggestion to the Central Ministry of Transportation to Fully Utilize the Large Number of Auto Parts Scattered Throughout Various Locations
    Peng Guohai writes: During the period of the Kuomintang reactionary rule, in order to achieve its goal of economic aggression, American imperialism dumped a large number of auto parts in China. It is estimated that these parts amount to approximately 120,000 boxes, most of which are scattered in Kunming, Guiyang, Chongqing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Changsha, and other places, with some being stockpiled in other transportation departments. After the nationwide asset inventory and capital verification work, and the establishment of a special organization by the Central People's Government Ministry of Transportation to handle them, these parts have undergone a certain amount of valuation work. However, because the handling of these parts was not closely integrated with the handling of old and scrap vehicles, and there was a lack of unified control, these parts have not been fully utilized. As a result, on the one hand, some vehicle repair units have suspended work due to the unavailability of parts, and on the other hand, a large number of parts are stockpiled without finding customers, causing considerable losses to the state.
    I believe that if we can fully utilize our existing tens of thousands of boxes of parts when handling old and scrap vehicles in various places, we can assemble a significant number of trucks, which will play a great role in national economic construction. Although some places are already doing this, there is a lack of a comprehensive handling plan. Therefore, I suggest that the Central Ministry of Transportation take unified control of these parts, supply them to various places in a planned manner, and appropriately establish some vehicle assembly plants based on the different needs and conditions of various places, and mobilize the broad masses of workers to handle these parts. In short, this large amount of material should be handled quickly; otherwise, as time goes by, its loss and scrap rate will increase significantly. This deserves serious attention.
    Editor's Note: We believe that Comrade Peng Guohai's suggestion is very important. Although the Central People's Government Ministry of Transportation established the National Old and Scrap Vehicle Repair and Handling Committee in August 1950 to be responsible for this handling work, these parts are still scattered in various places and have not been reasonably utilized, which should be paid attention to. Comrade Peng Guohai's suggestions on specific handling methods in the future can also be used as an important reference.

### 建议中央交通部充分利用散置各地的大批汽车配件

专栏：读者来信摘要

    建议中央交通部充分利用散置各地的大批汽车配件
    彭国海来信：在国民党反动统治时期，美帝国主义为了达到经济侵略的目的，曾在中国抛售了大批的汽车配件。这些配件据估计约有十二万箱，大部分散置在昆明、贵阳、重庆、上海、广州、长沙等地，还有一部分则被积压在其他运输部门。经过全国性的清理资产核定资金工作和中央人民政府交通部成立专门机构处理后，这些配件已经过一定的估价工作，但是，因为这项配件的处理没有和旧废汽车的处理紧密结合，同时缺乏统一的掌握，使这批配件没被充分利用。这样，一方面某些整修汽车的单位因购买不到配件而停工待料，另一方面大批配件积压着找不到顾主，使国家受到不少损失。
    我认为：如果各地在处理旧废汽车时能够充分利用我们现存的这十几万箱配件，就可以装配成不少辆卡车，对国家经济建设会起很大的作用。目前各地虽然也有这样做的，但都缺乏全面的处理计划。因而我建议中央交通部统一掌握这批配件，有计划地供应各地使用，并可依据各地不同需要与条件，适当设立一些汽车装配厂，发动广大职工群众处理这批配件。总之，这一大批物资应该迅速处理；否则随着时间的推移，它的损耗量与报废率就将大增。这是值得严重注意的。
    编者按：彭国海同志的建议，我们认为是很重要的。虽然中央人民政府交通部在一九五零年八月成立了全国旧废汽车整修处理委员会，负责进行这项处理工作，但是这批配件至今还被散置在各地未能得到合理利用，这是应该引起注意的。彭国海同志关于今后具体处理办法的建议，也可作为一个重要参考。
