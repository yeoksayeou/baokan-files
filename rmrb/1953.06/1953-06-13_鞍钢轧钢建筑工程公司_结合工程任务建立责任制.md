    Angang Steel Rolling Building Engineering Company
    Establishes Responsibility System Combined with Engineering Tasks
    The work of establishing a responsibility system at Angang Steel Rolling Building Engineering Company has gained preliminary experience.
    In the first stage of the movement, the Steel Rolling Building Engineering Company focused on ideological construction among the masses. They commended workers and technicians with advanced thinking and deeds, such as Dong Lianjiang, who consistently cherished state property; Zhang Shunlai, who consistently maintained excellent engineering quality; and Wei Junmao, a technician who was consistently responsible for engineering, which encouraged all employees to learn from advanced thinking. At the same time, they organized mass, conscious, and focused inspections and criticisms of the phenomenon of no one being responsible directly related to the project (such as the slag pit project, etc.), which had been exposed, enabling people to deeply understand the serious harm caused to project quality by the lack of responsibility. They used good and bad comparisons for ideological education, establishing in the minds of employees the concept of being masters who cherish state property, the concept of the overall situation, and the idea of comprehensively completing tasks, which rooted advanced thinking among the masses, thus forming the ideological foundation for establishing the responsibility system. Their experience proves that as long as the thinking of the masses is straightened out and thoroughly understood, they will proactively demand the establishment of a responsibility system, enabling the movement to smoothly transition into the stage of establishing a responsibility system.
    Establishing a responsibility system is the final and most important stage of the movement. It is imperative to fully estimate the complexity of this work and not relax leadership or let it fizzle out. The Steel Rolling Building Engineering Company continues to adhere to the policy of mobilizing the masses and closely integrating with engineering tasks. They carefully study the basic situation of the unit and the main problems in the work as the starting point for establishing the responsibility system. They first considered that the start of construction at the thin plate rolling mill construction site and the completion of the seamless steel pipe plant were the two major tasks they faced, and the responsibility system must be in place to ensure the completion of these two major engineering tasks. They also estimated the characteristics of the two major projects: the thin plate rolling mill construction site would start large-scale construction in June, pouring foundations, and quality must be emphasized first; the seamless steel pipe plant construction site was the final stage of the project, with parallel operations, which was very complex, and mutual cooperation must be emphasized to jointly ensure the completion of the task on schedule. Therefore, the content of the responsibility system for the two major projects should also be different according to the specific circumstances. This method of starting from reality prevents formalism in setting responsibility systems and the deviation of the movement from engineering tasks.
    How to get started?
    The approach of the Steel Rolling Building Engineering Company is: first, the leadership must have a clear understanding and prepare in advance. The most important thing is to revise the draft of the overall operation plan to make it accurate and balanced, so as to establish the main responsibility system on the basis of the operation plan. The Steel Rolling Building Engineering Company checked and revised the overall plan in accordance with the tasks assigned by the state, drawing on past construction experience and lessons learned, and the problems raised by the masses this time. They invited Soviet experts, managers of various professional engineering companies, and captains of engineering teams to a work plan balancing meeting. At the meeting, the company first put forward the monthly work plan for the thin plate rolling mill and the completion plan for the seamless steel pipe plant, and then repeatedly discussed them in large and small meetings. The content of the discussion included construction period, delivery date of design drawings, equipment, materials, processing orders, construction equipment and tools, and labor. During the discussion, the preparation work for construction was checked, the specific responsibilities of each unit for the project and the deadline for completing the task were clarified, and methods for mutual cooperation were studied to balance the progress of the project and strive to gradually eliminate phenomena such as idleness, waiting for materials, and waiting for drawings. When the operation plan is more accurate, the responsibility system can play a better role. After the revised overall engineering plan is approved by the higher authorities, the company will send the main points of the overall plan to the masses for discussion, revision, and supplementation. Then, each department and individual will put forward their own guarantee plan, and the administrative and technical management departments will put forward a plan of measures to ensure that technical management and material supply work are done in a timely manner. The workers put forward specific plans to ensure good, fast, economical, and safe work. After the plan is determined, the basic method for realizing the plan is to establish a responsibility system. Therefore, the issue of establishing a responsibility system must be resolved at the same time as mobilizing the masses to discuss the plan. The responsibility system should be established on the basis of ensuring the completion of the plan. The plan is the program for the joint action of various departments. Starting from the discussion and inspection of the plan makes the responsibility system the basic means to complete the plan, which closely combines the responsibility system with the engineering tasks.
    Second, among the workers, it is necessary to analyze and study the materials revealed to determine the future responsibility system; at the same time, it is also necessary to emphasize the study and discussion of advanced Soviet technical operating procedures. Only when workers master the technical operating procedures can they better achieve the requirements of "good, fast, economical, and safe." This year, there have been many changes in the construction of the thin plate rolling mill compared to last year. For example, with the help of Soviet experts, we have promoted construction according to the construction operation design, and the degree of mechanization of construction has also increased compared to last year. Workers will use new tools that they have not used in the past, such as concrete conveying pumps, diesel pile drivers, and mortar pumps. If workers cannot master the technical operating procedures well, it will affect the quality and progress of the project. Considering the need for large-scale construction in June, the Steel Rolling Building Engineering Company combined the establishment of a good, fast, economical, and safe responsibility system with mobilizing workers to study and discuss technical operating procedures, and mobilized everyone to put forward rationalization proposals to supplement technical operating procedures based on past construction experience and lessons learned in the study of operating procedures. Workers who learn technical operating procedures well and improve their technical level can make the responsibility system be implemented and consolidated.
    At the same time, the Steel Rolling Building Engineering Company also widely mobilized workers to discuss the responsibility system for ensuring good, fast, economical, and safe work in conjunction with solving various problems revealed. The workers first discussed the issue of ensuring project quality and operational safety, and put forward the slogans and methods of "guaranteeing quality, guaranteeing specifications, and guaranteeing standards." In order to realize these slogans, they put forward a "three-level inspection system," that is, self-inspection, mutual inspection, and leadership inspection. When discussing speed and economy, the workers proposed to use methods of finding tricks, finding key points, or experience to solve the problems of speed and economy. The practice of the Steel Rolling Building Engineering Company proves that mobilizing workers to summarize past experiences and lessons learned, and using workers' simple language to put forward slogans for future actions is an important way to establish a good, fast, economical, and safe responsibility system among workers.
    Third, further mobilize technicians, clerks, and office workers to participate in the work of establishing a responsibility system. The method of establishing a responsibility system in the management and technical departments is, on the one hand, for the management and technical departments to study the problems that have been revealed, summarize work experience, formulate or revise draft administrative responsibility systems at all levels, rules of duty for technicians, methods for drawing review, and draft quality inspection responsibility systems. Each business section puts forward the main draft responsibility systems according to the scope of business. These responsibility systems must be repeatedly discussed to make them practical and able to directly promote current work. On the other hand, the leadership must start from checking the preparation work for commencement of work to establish the most urgent responsibility system. After the Steel Rolling Building Engineering Company checked the construction preparation work of its department, it found that much of the processing order work had not been done well, and some did not even clarify whether orders had been placed and the delivery time. The inspection revealed a lack of a foundation responsibility system, and technicians and foremen did not divide the work for foundation pouring. They solved these problems and also established the future responsibility system. In the inspection, it was fully seen that after the fight against waste and against no one being responsible, the initiative of technicians and management personnel has been significantly enhanced. The finance department has determined the basic recording method for large-scale commencement of work, the design section has cleared up the drawings and made a method for drawing review and technical inspection, and the planning section has started to prepare monthly, weekly, and daily work plans. Everyone actively cooperates with the work around the engineering tasks, and uses an active and responsible spirit to perform the work they are responsible for, which is the most valuable new atmosphere.
    In the work of establishing a responsibility system, the Steel Rolling Building Engineering Company paid special attention to strengthening the responsibility of the leadership. For example, promptly put forward engineering plans, draft responsibility systems, and various specific measures, and mobilize the masses from top to bottom to discuss; pay attention to strengthening ideological work to prevent the phenomenon of simply discussing empty clauses; and in the leadership discussion, pay attention to summarizing the opinions of the masses and putting forward action slogans that are readily accepted by the masses to promote everyone's enthusiasm politically.

    鞍钢轧钢建筑工程公司
    结合工程任务建立责任制
    鞍钢轧钢建筑工程公司建立责任制度的工作，已获得了初步经验。
    轧钢建筑工程公司在运动的前一阶段注意了群众中的思想建设工作。他们表扬了有先进思想和先进事迹的工人、技术人员。如一贯爱护国家财产的董连江、一贯保持优良工程质量的张顺来、一贯对工程负责的技术人员韦君茂等，鼓舞了全体职工向先进思想学习的热情。同时，他们把揭发出来的同工程有直接关系的无人负责现象（如铁渣坑工程等）组织群众性的自觉的重点检查与批判，使人们深刻地认识到无人负责对工程质量所造成的严重危害。他们用好坏对比的方法进行思想教育，在职工中树立了爱护国家财产的主人翁观念、整体观念和全面完成任务的思想，在群众中扎下了先进思想的根子，这就成了建立责任制的思想基础。他们的经验证明：只要群众的思想搞通，搞透，便会主动地要求建立责任制，使运动顺利地转入建立责任制阶段。
    建立责任制是运动最后的也是最重要的一个阶段，一定要充分估计到这个工作的复杂性，不可放松领导，虎头蛇尾。轧钢建筑工程公司继续坚持发动群众、紧密结合工程任务的方针。认真研究本单位的基本情况和工作中的主要问题，作为建立责任制的出发点。他们首先考虑到：薄板轧钢厂建筑工地开工和无缝钢管厂的竣工是他们面临的两大任务，责任制必须为了保证完成这两大工程任务。他们又估计到两大工程的特点：薄板轧钢厂工地六月份要大量开工，浇灌基础，必须首先强调质量；无缝钢管厂工地是结尾期的工程，平行作业，十分复杂，必须强调相互配合，共同负责保证按期完成任务。因此，根据具体情况的不同，两大工程责任制的内容也应有所不同。这种从实际出发的方法，防止了订责任制时的形式主义及运动与工程任务脱节的偏向。
    怎样入手呢？
    轧钢建筑工程公司的做法是：第一，领导上心中有数，事前做好准备工作。最重要的是修订总的作业计划草案，使之准确、平衡，以便在作业计划基础上建立主要的责任制。轧钢建筑工程公司按照国家交付的任务，吸收过去施工中的经验教训和这次群众提出来的问题，检查修正总的计划。他们约请苏联专家、各专业工程公司经理、工程队队长开作业计划平衡会议。在会上由公司首先提出薄板轧钢厂的月作业计划和无缝钢管厂的竣工计划，然后在大会上小会上进行反复讨论。讨论的内容包括工期、设计图纸交付日期、设备、材料、加工订货、施工设备与工具、劳动力等方面问题。在讨论中，检查了施工准备工作的情况，明确了各单位对工程应负的具体责任和完成任务的期限，并研究出相互配合工作的办法，使工程进度达到平衡，争取逐步消除窝工、待料、待图等现象。作业计划订得比较准确了，责任制就可以更好地发挥作用。修订后的总的工程计划经上级批准后，即由公司把总计划的要点发到群众中讨论、修正和补充。然后由各部门各个人提出自己的保证计划，行政技术管理部门提措施计划，保证及时做好技术管理和材料供应工作。工人们提保证达到好、快、省、安全的具体计划。计划确定后，使计划实现的基本方法就是建立责任制，因此，在发动群众讨论计划中必须同时解决建立责任制的问题。责任制应当建立在保证完成计划的基础上。计划是各个部门共同行动的纲领。从讨论和检查计划入手，使责任制成为完成计划的基本手段，这就使责任制紧紧地结合了工程任务。
    第二，在工人中要一面根据揭发出来的材料分析研究，确定今后的责任制度；一面还要强调学习讨论苏联先进的技术操作规程。工人们只有掌握了技术操作规程，才能更好地达到“好、快、省、安全”的要求。今年薄板轧钢厂施工比去年有不少变化，如我们在苏联专家帮助下推行了按照施工作业设计进行施工，施工的机械化程度也比去年增加，工人们将要使用过去没有用过的混凝土输送泵，柴油打桩机和灰浆泵等新式工具。如果工人不能很好掌握技术操作规程，就会影响工程的质量和进度。轧钢建筑工程公司考虑到六月份大量施工的需要，把建立好、快、省、安全责任制同发动工人学习讨论技术操作规程结合起来，发动大家按照过去施工的经验教训，在学习操作规程中，提合理化建议，补充技术操作规程。工人们学好技术操作规程，提高了技术水平，才能使责任制得到贯彻和巩固。
    与此同时，轧钢建筑工程公司又普遍发动工人结合解决揭发出来的各种问题，讨论保证好、快、省、安全的责任制。工人们首先讨论了保证工程质量和操作安全问题，提出了“保质量，保规格，保标准”的口号和办法，为了实现这些口号，提出了“三关检查制”，即自己检查，互相检查和领导检查的制度。在讨论快和省的时候，工人们提出要用找窍门，找关键，或经验的办法来解决快和省的问题。轧钢建筑工程公司的做法证明，发动工人总结过去的经验教训，用工人朴素的语言提出今后的行动口号，是在工人中建立好、快、省、安全责任制的一个重要办法。
    第三，进一步发动技术人员、职员、机关工作人员参加建立责任制的工作。在管理和技术部门建立责任制的方法，一方面是由管理和技术部门研究已经揭发出来的问题，总结工作经验，制订或修订各级行政负责制草案、技术人员职责条例、图纸会审办法和质量检查责任制等草案，各业务科按业务范围提出主要的责任制草案，这些责任制都要经过反复讨论，使之切合实际，能够直接推动当前工作；另一方面，领导上要从检查开工准备工作入手建立当前最迫切需要的责任制度。轧钢建筑工程公司检查本部门施工准备工作后，发现许多加工订货工作尚未做好，有的连是否已经订货和交货时间都没有弄清楚；检查出缺少基础负责制，技术员和领工员对基础浇灌工作没有分工等等问题。他们解决了这些问题，同时也树立了今后的责任制。在检查中充分看到：技术人员和管理人员经过反浪费、反无人负责斗争后，工作的主动性显著增强了，财务部门确定了大量开工时的基层记录办法，设计科查清了图纸并订出图纸会审、技术检查的办法，计划科着手准备月、周和日的作业计划，大家围绕着工程任务主动配合工作，用积极负责的精神来执行自己所担负的工作，这是最可宝贵的新气象。
    轧钢建筑工程公司在建立责任制的工作中，特别注意了加强领导的责任。如及时提出工程计划、责任制草案和各种具体措施，由上而下发动群众讨论；注意加强思想工作，防止单纯讨论空洞条文的现象，在领导讨论中注意总结群众的意见，提出为群众所乐于接受的行动口号，从政治上发扬大家的积极性。（安岗）
