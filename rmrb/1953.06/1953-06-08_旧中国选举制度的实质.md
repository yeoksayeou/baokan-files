    The promulgation of the "Election Law of the National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China and Local People's Congresses at All Levels" marks a new stage in the development of China's people's democratic politics.
    This new election system is only possible today, after the great victory of the Chinese people's revolution. Before this, in old China, constitutions had existed, and elections had taken place, but they were all tools for the reactionary ruling class. What actually existed was the cannibalistic politics of feudal, comprador-fascist dictatorship. As we welcome universal suffrage today, examining the essence of the hypocritical and reactionary election systems of old China will help us to more deeply appreciate the superiority of today's people's new China election system.
    I
    In 1900, the Eight-Nation Alliance of the United States, Britain, Germany, Japan, and others used unprecedentedly brutal means to suppress the Chinese people's uprising against foreign imperialism, while the Manchu Qing dynasty once again betrayed the people, kowtowing to the robbers and signing a shameful treaty. In 1905, Sun Yat-sen's Tongmenghui (Revolutionary Alliance) was established in Tokyo, and the following year saw the outbreak of the Ping-Liu-Li Uprising. These facts illustrate that the oppressed and exploited Chinese people were unwilling to live as before, and at the same time, the Manchu Qing dynasty could no longer rule as before.
    A drowning man will clutch at a straw; a dying dynasty likewise seeks salvation in a parliament. The reason why the Manchu Qing dynasty began preparing to establish the Zizhengyuan (central) and Ziyiju (local) in 1906 was precisely to缓和 the growth of the revolutionary movement at that time. The Zizhengyuan and Ziyiju were merely "meetings of the gentry" or "consultative" legislative bodies in nature, which was precisely the straw that the dying Qing Dynasty wanted to grasp.
    The election of members of the Zizhengyuan, according to the regulations, was divided into "imperial selection" and "mutual selection," each with a hundred members, all required to be at least thirty years old. What is meant by "imperial selection"? This term is still an "outstanding" creation in the history of world election systems. The so-called "imperial selection" was the direct appointment by the Manchu Qing Emperor. The qualifications for being appointed stipulated: 1. Qing imperial clansmen, princes, dukes, and hereditary nobles; 2. Manchu and Han hereditary nobles; 3. Outer Mongolian princes, dukes, and hereditary nobles; 4. Imperial clansmen of the Gioro lineage; 5. Officials of the various ministries and yamen from the fourth rank to the seventh rank; 6. Acclaimed scholars and learned Confucianists; 7. Those who pay a large amount of taxes. In short, these people were all upper-level members or loyal slaves of the ruling group of the royal family, nobles, officials, and landlords. What is meant by "mutual selection"? It was the mutual selection of candidates by the members of the Ziyiju of each province, and then the governors and viceroys of each province would circle half of them as elected. Needless to say, the people "mutually selected" in this way were of the same ilk as those "imperially selected."
    According to the regulations of the Ziyiju, the qualifications for both electors and those being elected were very strict. First, there was an age restriction: electors had to be at least 25 years old, and those being elected had to be at least 30 years old. Second, there was a gender restriction: both electors and those being elected were limited to males. Third, there was a residency restriction: those residing in the province had to have resided there for more than ten years to have the right to vote and be elected. Fourth, there were qualification restrictions, including property, education, social experience, and other items, namely: 1. Having handled public welfare affairs in the province for more than three years; 2. Having graduated from a secondary school or above; 3. Having the background of a Juren, Gongshi, or Shengyuan; 4. Having served as a substantive official of the seventh rank or above for civil officials or the fifth rank or above for military officials; 5. Having business capital or real estate worth more than 5,000 yuan in the province, or having business capital or real estate worth more than 10,000 yuan in the place of residence for those residing in the province. In addition, there were many negative restrictions. In short, there was no place for the masses of people here; nobles and officials controlled everything. Straws cannot save a drowning man, and the Zizhengyuan could not save the demise of the Manchu Qing dynasty. The tide of the Xinhai Revolution in 1911 finally swallowed up the Manchu Qing imperial system.
    II
    As an old democratic revolution, the Xinhai Revolution, due to the economic and political weakness of the bourgeoisie that led this revolution, and due to their incomplete revolution, did not liberate the masses of the people; the fruits of victory were plundered by the big landlords and big bourgeoisie.
    Therefore, the parliament at that time, and the elections at that time, could only be hypocritical facades. The so-called parliament was nothing more than a tool for warlord autocracy.
    Let's take a look at what tricks these parliaments and elections were playing!
    In August 1912, the then so-called "President" Yuan Shikai promulgated a series of election regulations, which was the beginning of China's election system with an old democratic flavor but still essentially a reactionary dictatorship of big landlords and big bourgeoisie. According to Articles 4, 6, and 7 of the Election Law for Members of the House of Representatives, those who had the right to vote must first be males who were at least 21 years old, secondly, they had to have resided in the electoral district for more than two years before compiling the voter list, and thirdly, they had to have one of the following qualifications: 1. Paying direct taxes of more than two yuan per year; 2. Having real estate worth more than 500 yuan; 3. Graduating from a primary school or above, or having qualifications equivalent to graduating from a primary school or above. Those who had the right to be elected must also be at least 25 years old. If they were a minority, they must be proficient in Chinese. The broad masses of workers and peasants who were illiterate, primary school teachers, and students in various schools were either not given the right to vote, or their exercise of the right to vote was suspended. As for the members of the Senate, according to the Election Law for Members of the Senate, they were elected by the provincial assemblies. The qualifications for electors and those being elected in the provincial assemblies were exactly the same as those in the Election Law for Members of the House of Representatives.
    This kind of election system, like the election systems of capitalist countries such as the United States, Britain, and France, was a system in which a few people enjoyed democracy and freedom, while the majority were excluded from political life. First, it excluded women, who accounted for half of the population; secondly, it used provisions on property, education, and other qualifications to exclude the broad masses of working people, especially the working class and the peasantry; similarly, it also excluded young intellectuals; finally, by making proficiency in Chinese a condition, it excluded ethnic minorities. May I ask how many people are left who enjoy the right to vote?
    This is only expressed in writing; as for the actual situation, it is more than that. "Originally, the so-called members of parliament, apart from a few individual members, were not truly elected by the people. This was just a batch of political money transactions. During the preliminary election, the so-called 'candidates' in various places (most of whom belonged to bureaucrats, politicians, party hacks, and the original local bullies and evil gentry), they arbitrarily falsified voter lists, hired people to vote 'electing' themselves, and among the 'candidates,' they also made a round of transactions with each other. Whoever had the greater influence and spent more money could be 'elected.' After this buying and selling in the preliminary election, those who were 'elected' also got the opportunity to do a bigger business in the 're-election,' seeing who had the greater influence and who spent more money to buy votes, he would sell the votes to whom. In this way, he not only recovered the capital he invested in the preliminary election, but also made money again; and whoever spent more money, of course, bought more votes, and could be 'officially elected' as a member of parliament. Once this batch of members of parliament arrived in Beijing, they could do an even bigger business, selling to this party, selling to that party." (Chen Boda: "Yuan Shikai, the Thief Who Stole the Country," pages 27-28) Selling to this warlord, selling to that warlord. The last transaction of these members of parliament was the infamous Cao Kun bribery election in 1923. Each of them received a bank check for five thousand yuan and unanimously elected Cao Kun as president. The ridicule of "piglet parliament" and "piglet members of parliament" became the most shameful names in the history of Chinese elections.
    Such an old parliament actually played the role of a vase, so naturally it could not escape the fate of a vase. In just over a decade, it was dissolved twice. When it was dissolved, the warlords still had to find another satisfactory ornament. How was this ornament produced? The first was Yuan (Shikai)'s "National Assembly." Please see the secret telegram of the "National Assembly Affairs Bureau" of Yuan's henchmen at the time: "The preliminary elected candidates of the National Assembly in various counties are actually the pivot for producing national representatives, and should be given special attention. The preliminary election supervisors in various counties should be able to understand this in detail and make good use of it; as far as possible, before holding the preliminary election, first carefully examine those who have the qualifications to be elected, and select those who are pure in nature and consistent in purpose, and can conform to the scope, and pre-design them as preliminary elected candidates. Then, devise ways to direct the electors and properly control them. If there are any obstacles that are difficult to overcome, it is okay to add invisible coercion." What a "detailed understanding and good use"! Even today, through this passage, we can fully "understand in detail" the truth of the elections at that time, without the need for more explanation. We must remember: it was this "National Assembly" that conducted the "state system" vote at the end of 1915, "electing" Yuan Shikai as the "Emperor of the Chinese Empire."
    The second is Duan (Qirui)'s "New Parliament" (commonly known as the Anfu Parliament). How was this "New Parliament" produced? According to Duan's "Election Law for Members of the Senate of the New Parliament," members of the Senate were elected by the local election committees and the central election committee through mutual selection. The primary electors of the local election committees must have one of the following qualifications: 1. Paying direct taxes of more than 500 yuan per year or having real estate worth more than 50,000 yuan; 2. Having served as an official above the rank of Jianren for more than three years or having served as an official above the rank of Jianren for more than one year; 3. Having graduated from a higher specialized school or above and having worked for more than three years. In the central election committee, the property qualification for those who enjoyed the qualification to mutually select senators was raised to more than one million yuan, and the annual direct tax payment was raised to more than one thousand yuan; the official qualification was raised to retired president, vice president, state councilor, or having served as a special appointee official for more than one year; the education qualification was also raised to university graduation and having worked for more than three years. The Election Law for Members of the House of Representatives also raised the property qualification for electors of members of the House of Representatives to real estate worth more than one thousand yuan or an annual direct tax payment of more than four yuan. This kind of restriction on election qualifications is difficult to find in any election law in the world. It most wantonly and crudely deprived the working people and even the petty bourgeoisie of their right to vote, while nakedly guaranteeing the monopolized right to vote of the big landlords, big compradors, and their political representatives, the big bureaucrats. The "achievement" of this "New Parliament" was to help its master Duan Qirui sell the Gao-Xu and Shun-Ji railways and elect Xu Shichang, a remnant of the Manchu Qing dynasty, as president.
    III
    Chiang Kai-shek, who betrayed the revolution, launched a sudden attack on the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people to gain the favor of imperialists and feudal lords, and established a fascist new-style counter-revolutionary dictatorial rule. This reactionary group, which included big landlords, big compradors, big bureaucrats, big warlords, as well as ruffians, thugs, bandits, and party hacks, used the counter-revolutionary armed forces and special agent organizations trained by imperialists as tools of its reactionary dynasty. At the beginning, it was not even prepared to use the election system as a fig leaf for its dictatorial rule.
    In 1931, Japanese imperialists launched the "September 18th" Incident. After that, social class relations showed great changes. Not only did workers, peasants, and the petty bourgeoisie more actively rise up to oppose Chiang Kai-shek's rule, but also the contradictions between the liberal bourgeoisie and the Chiang Kai-shek government became increasingly significant and deepened. Faced with the people's anti-Japanese movement, Chiang Kai-shek was even more afraid of the crisis of the revolution, so he put forward the slogan of "ending political tutelage" and "convening the National Assembly." It was also under these circumstances that the "Organic Law of the National Assembly" and the "Election Law for Representatives of the National Assembly" were promulgated in 1936, and so-called elections were conducted according to these laws.
    According to these two laws, the representatives of the pseudo-National Assembly were divided into three types: ex officio representatives, ex officio non-voting representatives, and "elected" representatives. The central executive committee members and supervisory committee members of the reactionary Kuomintang were ex officio representatives; the alternate central executive and supervisory committee members of the reactionary Kuomintang, the pseudo-chairman and members of the pseudo-National Government, the pseudo-chiefs of the pseudo-Yuan, ministries, and councils, and the personnel specially permitted by the presidium of the pseudo-National Assembly were ex officio non-voting representatives. As for the "elected" representatives, we can look at them from both the right to vote and the right to be elected. On the right to vote side, according to the regulations, all Chinese people who are at least 20 years old and have taken the "citizen oath" have the right to vote. However, "those who have been convicted of betraying the National Government or are still wanted shall not have the right to vote." To translate it into plain language, it means: all those who swear allegiance to the Chiang family court have the right to vote, and all those who engage in revolutionary activities, oppose the rule of the Chiang bandit gang, and have suffered persecution from the Chiang bandit gang do not have the right to vote. Looking at it from the side of the right to be elected, each election area is selected by the heads of the pseudo-townships, towns, and neighborhoods, the staff of the organs of various professional groups and overseas Chinese groups, and the heads of various military and military academies to recommend candidates for representatives with a number of times the quota, and the pseudo-provincial government signs its opinions, and then the pseudo-National Government designates two or three times the number of people as formal candidates. Finally, the voters circle one person among the candidates as the elected representative. In summary, the "elected" representatives are first recommended by the pseudo-township, town, and neighborhood heads who serve as small Chiang Kai-sheks, then signed by the Chiang's provincial government, then designated by Chiang Kai-shek himself, and finally circled by "citizens" who have sworn allegiance to Chiang Kai-shek. Compared with the "imperial selection" of the Manchu Qing dynasty, if there is any difference, it is only that the means of deception are more skillful. The election situation at that time was just as reported by the Observation magazine: "It caused a stir throughout the country, the people were uneasy, the public and private wealth was greatly consumed, and the social morality and order were severely damaged... The spiritual and material losses are incalculable. Some people compare it to a 'election disaster,' and believe that no disaster of flood, drought, wind, or fire is as universal and deep as this 'election disaster'."
    The counter-revolutionary dictator Chiang Kai-shek was not even interested in the "National Congress" he created himself, and it was not convened for a long time. It was not until the victory of the Anti-Japanese War that the slogans of "opposing the Kuomintang's one-party dictatorship" and "establishing a democratic coalition government" became the unanimous voice of the broad masses of the people that Chiang Kai-shek "wanted to regard the so-called 'National Congress' as a magic weapon to worship, first to resist the coalition government, second to maintain dictatorial rule, and third to prepare for the reason for the civil war." Therefore, "ignoring the demands of the broad masses of the people and all democratic parties, he stubbornly convened a so-called 'National Congress' monopolized by the Kuomintang's anti-people group," "pretending to 'return power to the people,' but in reality, it was still 'returning power' to the anti-people group within the Kuomintang." ("Selected Works of Mao Zedong," Volume 3, pages 1091, 1092) This Chiang's "National Congress," in addition to the representatives "imperially selected" by Chiang Kai-shek eight years ago, was joined by the clowns of the two political beggar parties—the Youth Party and the Democratic Socialist Party—who were elected according to the so-called "Supplementary Regulations on the Election of Representatives of the National Congress." But this play was so unpopular that, as the editorial of the Liberation Daily said: "Breaking iron shoes, nowhere to find a cheering spectator." Not only the Communist Party, but also the Democratic League and many righteous people refused to participate in this Chiang's "National Congress." Those who participated in this "National Congress" were called "fallen into the water" by the people, and called "falling into the fiery pit of a brothel." A pseudo-constitution "formulated" by the piglets of this National Congress was as infamous as the "constitution" of Cao Kun's piglet National Congress.
    Before Yuan Shikai died, he wanted to have the addiction of being an emperor. Chiang Kai-shek also wanted to have the addiction of being a "president" before rolling to Taiwan. Under the control of this greed, a series of pseudo-election regulations were announced again in the Chiang-controlled area, and another round of pseudo-elections was staged. According to the pseudo-National Congress Representative Election Law, elections were "carried out by universal, equal, direct, and unsigned list voting." "Citizens of the Republic of China who are at least 20 years old have the right to vote; those who are at least 23 years old have the right to be elected." However, the important thing is not how Chiang Kai-shek's clauses are written, but the reality of the Chiang dynasty. From the various reports in the publications of the Chiang-controlled area at that time, let's list a few briefly: First, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang's "central determination method stipulates that whether it is a representative of the National Congress or a legislator, they are absolutely controlled." This determination is "also called imperial determination." Second, before the election, the three reactionary parties of the Kuomintang, the Youth Party, and the Democratic Socialist Party conducted months of spoils negotiation under the smoke screen of the pseudo-Political Consultative Conference, and as a result, a robbers' agreement of mutual concessions and guaranteed election was established. Third, "A certain rich man had already spent a lot of money to run for election, but after two written threats and one time four people went upstairs and taught him a lesson with a pistol, he was discouraged and withdrew from the election." Fourth, "The party officials disarmed the union's election certificates... The heads of each unit are responsible for gathering fifty literate workers or handymen, and they cast 3,150 votes for a certain person in two days. These fifty voting experts have to eat... so they need money, and the voting affairs fee is 4 million, which is distributed to each employee." Fifth, before the election, a large number of people who did not actually exist were temporarily added to the voter list in order to receive more election certificates. "After receiving the election certificates, the masters of carving seals were busy." Sixth, use ticket peddlers to "guarantee tickets," 50,000 yuan per ticket, one hand handing over the ticket, one hand handing over the money. "Most of the pseudo-township and bao heads have the qualifications to be ticket peddlers, playing a very important role." Seventh, they brought four or five hundred soldiers to the polling place to vote, and vigorously campaigned at the entrance of the polling place, "advising" people to vote for a certain person. Eighth, it is estimated that the activity expenses spent by each candidate averaged 500 million Chiang's currency. There are about 2,000 places for "National Congress" and "legislators." Assuming that the activity expenses spent by each candidate for each quota are conservatively estimated at 1 billion yuan, then the total cost is more than 2 trillion yuan... All means of deception, deception, bribery, enticement, assassination, and armed fighting were used. The bizarre ugliness is simply endless. Compared with Yuan Shikai and Cao Kun's methods, it is really a small trick compared to a big one.
    The end of the pseudo-election farce is often followed by the demise of the "dynasty," which is the logic of history. Not long after Chiang Kai-shek put on the shroud of "president," he was swept out of mainland China by the people's iron broom.
    Through a difficult and tortuous path, the Chinese working class and the Chinese people finally defeated the rule of powerful imperialism and its running dogs in China. Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, thanks to the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and thanks to the efforts of the people, great victories have been achieved on various fronts, which have created the necessary conditions for large-scale planned economic construction and cultural construction, and have also created the necessary conditions for implementing a truly universal and equal election system. Democracy and freedom have become a reality today. We are about to conduct an unprecedented universal suffrage on a national scale. The development of history tells us that all hypocritical and deceptive election systems utilized by the reactionary ruling class are bound to go bankrupt, while the new democratic election system that has won victory and truly belongs to the people.

    旧中国选举制度的实质
    戴修瓒  吴传颐  李浩培
    “中华人民共和国全国人民代表大会及地方各级人民代表大会选举法”的颁布，标志着我国人民民主政治发展的新阶段。
    这种新的选举制度只有在中国人民大革命取得伟大胜利的今天才有可能实现。在这以前，在旧中国，宪法，已有过了，选举，也有过了，可是那都是反动统治阶级的御用工具。实际存在的只有封建买办法西斯专政的吃人政治。在迎接普选的今天，我们来考察一下旧中国的那些虚伪的反动的选举制度的实质，会使我们更深切地体会今天人民的新中国选举制度的优越性。
    一
    一九○○年美英德日等八国联军用空前残暴的手段镇压了中国人民反对外国帝国主义的起义，满清王朝却又一次叛卖了人民，向强盗们屈膝，缔结了可耻的和约。一九○五年孙中山的革命同盟会在东京成立，翌年跟着就爆发了醴萍之役。这些事实说明了被压迫被剥削的中国人民不愿照旧生活，同时，满清王朝也不能照旧统治下去。
    快被淹死的人，总想抓住一根稻草；临终的王朝，也同样地想乞灵于国会。一九○六年满清王朝之所以开始筹设资政院（中央）和谘议局（地方），正是为了想缓和当时革命运动的增长。资政院和谘议局从性质上说仅仅是“缙绅会议”或“谘议的”立法机关，这正是垂死的满清所想抓住的稻草。
    资政院议员的选举，按照章程分为“钦选”和“互选”两种，它的人数各为一百，年龄一律要满三十岁。什么叫做“钦选”呢？这个名词在世界选举制度史上还是“杰出”的创作。所谓“钦选”就是满清皇上直接的任命。被任命的资格规定：一、清宗室王公世爵，二、满汉世爵，三、外藩王公世爵，四、宗室觉罗，五、各部院衙门四品以下七品以上的官员，六、硕学通儒，七、纳税多额者。总之，这些人都是皇室、贵族、官僚、地主等统治集团的上层分子或忠实奴才。什么叫做“互选”呢？是由各省谘议局议员互选候补当选人，再由各省督抚圈定一半，作为当选。不消说，这样“互选”出来的人物，和“钦选”的都是一邱之貉。
    按照谘议局的章程，选举和被选举的资格都是很严格的。第一是年龄的限制，选举人须满二十五岁，被选举人须满三十岁。第二是性别的限制，选举人和被选举人一律以男性为限。第三是居住期限的限制，寄居本省须满十年以上，才有选举权和被选举权。第四是资格的限制，这里包括了财产、教育、社会经历等项目，即：一、曾在本省办理公益事务满三年以上；二、曾在中等以上学校毕业；三、有举贡生员的出身；四、曾任实缺职官文七品武五品以上；五、在本省有五千元以上营业资本或不动产，寄居本省的则要在寄居地方所有营业、资本或不动产达一万元以上。此外，还有很多消极的限制。总之，这里决没有人民大众的份，贵族官僚把持了一切。稻草救不了快淹死的人，资政院也挽救不了满清王朝的灭亡。一九一一年辛亥革命的浪潮，终于把满清帝制吞没了。
    二
    作为旧民主主义革命的辛亥革命，由于领导这革命的资产阶级在经济上政治上的软弱性，由于他们革命的不彻底性，所以并没有使人民大众获得解放；胜利的果实是被大地主大资产阶级劫夺了。
    因之，当时的国会，当时的选举，也只能是虚伪的招牌。所谓国会，不过是军阀专制的御用工具。
    我们且看看这些国会和选举是玩的什么把戏吧！
    一九一二年八月，当时的所谓“大总统”袁世凯公布了一系列的选举法规，这是中国带有旧民主气味而本质上仍是大地主大资产阶级反动专政的选举制度的开始。依众议院议员选举法第四、六、七各条，有选举权的首先必须是年满二十一岁的男子，其次要在编制选举人名册以前，在选举区内居住二年以上，第三须具有下列资格的一种：一、年纳直接税二元以上；二、有值五百元以上的不动产；三、在小学校以上毕业或有与小学校以上毕业相当的资格。有被选举权的，还须年满二十五岁。要是少数民族，必须通晓汉语。不识文字的广大工农群众，小学校教员和各学校肄业生，或者干脆不给他们选举权，或者停止他们选举权利的行使。至于参议院议员，依参议院议员选举法，由省议会选举。而省议会的选举人和被选举人资格的规定，和众议院议员选举法一模一样。
    这种选举制度和美英法那些资本主义国家选举制度一样，是一个少数人享有民主和自由，而多数人被排斥于政治生活之外的制度。它首先排斥了占人口半数的妇女；其次，它利用关于财产、教育等资格的规定排斥了广大劳动人民，特别是工人阶级和农民阶级，同样，它也排斥了青年知识分子；最后，以通晓汉语为条件，它排斥了少数民族。试问这样留下来享有选举权利的人，还有多少呢？
    这只不过是表现在文字上的，至于实际的情况，还不止此。“原来所谓国会议员，除了若干个别的议员之外，并不是真正由人民选举出来的。这只是一批政治的金钱买卖。在初选时候，各地方的所谓 ‘候选人’（其中大部分属于官僚、政客、党棍和原来的劣绅、土豪一类），他们任意假造选举名册，雇人投票‘选举’自己，并且各‘候选人’之中又互相做一番买卖，谁的势力越大，花钱越多，谁就越能当
    ‘选’。在初选中这末买卖之后，‘当选’的，也就得了机会，可以在‘复选’中做一番较大的买卖，看谁的势力大，谁买票的钱多，他就卖票给谁。这样，他就不但捞回了在初选中投下的本，并且还重新赚了钱；而谁花钱越多的，买的票数当然也越多，也就可以‘正式当选’做起国会议员了。这批议员
    一到了北京，便又可以做一番更大的买卖，卖给这党，卖给那党”。（陈伯达：“窃国大盗袁世凯”第二十七—二十八页）卖给这个军阀，卖给那个军阀。这些议员们的最后一次买卖，就是臭名远扬的一九二三年曹锟贿选。他们每人得到了五千元的银行支票，一致选举曹锟做总统。“猪仔国会”，“猪仔议员”的笑骂，成了中国选举史上最可耻的名称。
    这样的旧国会实际上是担当花瓶的角色，因此自然也免不了花瓶的命运。短短十多年里，就遭到两次解散。当它被解散后，军阀们还少不得要另找一个惬意的装饰品。这种装饰品是怎样搞出来的呢？第一个是袁（世凯）记“国民代表大会”。请看当时袁氏党徒的“国民会议事务局”的秘密电报：“国民会议各县之初选当选人，实为产出国民代表之机枢，允宜特别注意。各县初选监督当能体会入微，善为运用；尽可能于未举行初选之前，先将有被选资格之人，详加考察，择其性行纯和，宗旨一贯，能就范围者，预拟为初选当选人。再将选举人设法指挥，妥为支配。果有滞碍难通处，不妨隐加以无形之强制。”好一个“体会入微，善为运用”！就在今天，通过这一段文字，我们对当时的选举真相，也足能“体会入微”，不需要更多的说明了。我们必须记住：就是这个“国民代表大会”，在一九一五年底进行了“国体”投票，“选举”袁世凯为
    “中华帝国皇帝”。
    第二个要数段（祺瑞）记“新国会”（通称安福国会）。这个“新国会”又是怎样搞出来的呢？依段记“新国会”参议院议员选举法，参议院议员由地方选举会选举和中央选举会互选。地方选举会的初选人必须具有下列资格之一：一、年纳直接税五百元以上或有不动产五万元以上；二、曾任荐任以上官职满三年或曾任简任以上的官职满一年；三、曾在高等专门以上学校毕业并任事满三年。在中央选举会中享有互选参议员资格的人，依该法财产资格提高到一百万元以上，年纳直接税一千元以上；官僚资格则提高到退职大总统、副总统、国务员或曾任特任官一年以上；教育资格也提高到大学毕业并任事满三年。众议院议员选举法也把众议员选举人的财产资格提高到一千元以上的不动产或年纳直接税四元以上。这种选举资格的限制，在世界任何选举法中都是很难找到的。它最蛮横地最粗暴地剥夺了劳动人民甚至小资产阶级的选举权利，同时赤裸裸地保证了大地主大买办和他的政治代表大官僚的垄断选举权。这个“新国会”的“功绩”，就是帮同他的主子段祺瑞出卖高徐、顺济两铁路，并选出满清余孽徐世昌为总统。
    三
    叛卖革命，对中国共产党和中国人民进行突然的袭击，以取得帝国主义者和封建主宠信的蒋介石，更建立了法西斯式的新式的反革命独裁统治。这个包括了大地主、大买办、大官僚、大军阀以及流氓、地痞、匪徒、党棍的反动集团，以帝国主义训练出来的反革命武装和特务组织为工具的反动王朝，在开始时根本还没有准备把选举制度拿来作为自己独裁统治的遮羞布。
    一九三一年，日本帝国主义者发动了“九一八”事变。之后，社会阶级关系显出了很大的变化，不但工人、农民和小资产阶级更加积极地起来反对蒋介石统治，而且自由资产阶级和蒋介石政府的矛盾也日益显著与加深。蒋介石在人民的抗日运动面前，更加害怕革命的危机，于是提出了“结束训政”
    “召开国民大会”的口号。也就在这种情况下，一九三六年公布了“国民大会组织法”和“国民大会代表选举法”，同时根据这些法令进行了所谓选举。
    依照这两个法律，伪国民大会的代表，分为当然代表，当然列席代表和“民选”代表三种。反动的国民党的中央执行委员和监察委员是当然代表，反动的国民党的候补中央执监委员、伪国民政府主席和委员、伪各院部会的伪长官以及伪国民大会主席团特许的人员是当然列席代表。至于“民选”代表，可以从选举权和被选举权两方面来看。在选举权这一方面，依规定凡年满二十岁的中国人民，经“公民宣誓”者，都有选举权，可是，“背叛国民政府经判决确定或尚在通缉中者，不得有选举权。”把它译成明白的语言，就是说：凡是宣誓效忠蒋家朝庭的就有选举权，凡进行革命活动，反对蒋匪帮统治，遭受过蒋匪帮迫害的一律没有选举权。再从被选举权这方面来看，各选举区域由伪乡、镇、坊长、各职业团体和各华侨团体的机关职员及各军队军校的长官推选应出代表名额若干倍的人为候选人，经伪省政府签注意见，再经伪国民政府指定二倍或三倍的人数为正式候选人。最后由选举人就候选人中圈定一人为当选代表。总结起来，“民选”代表，先由作为小蒋介石的伪乡镇坊长推选，再由蒋记省政府签注，再由蒋介石自己指定，最后经由向蒋介石宣誓效忠的“公民”圈出。这和满清王朝的“钦选”比起来，要说不同的话，那就是欺骗手段的更为巧妙而已。当时的选举情况，正如观察杂志所报道：“闹得举国骚然，鸡犬不宁，公私耗财之巨，社会风纪秩序破坏之烈……精神物质一切损失之无法计算。有人比之为‘选灾’，而且认为水灾、旱灾、风灾、火灾任何一种灾也没有这‘选灾’普遍而深入。”
    反革命独裁者蒋介石，连它自己一手制造的“国大”也不感兴趣，久久没有召开。直到抗日战争胜利，“反对国民党一党专政”“成立民主联合政府”的口号，成了广大人民的一致呼声时，蒋介石才“想把所谓‘国民大会’当作法宝，祭起来，一则抵制联合政府，二则维持独裁统治，三则准备内战理由。”因此，“不顾广大人民和一切民主党派的要求，一意孤行地召开一个由国民党反人民集团一手包办的所谓‘国民大会’”，“装模作样地‘还政于民’，实际上，依然是‘还政’于国民党内的反人民集团。”（“毛泽东选集”第三卷一○九一、一○九二页）这个蒋记“国大”，除了早在八年前蒋介石“钦选”的代表外，再加上依所谓“国民大会代表选举补充条例”而选出的两个政治乞丐党——青年党、民社党的丑角们登场。可是这出戏唱得如此冷场，正如解放日报社论所说的：“踏破铁鞋，无处觅到一个喝彩的看客。”拒绝参加这个蒋记“国大”的，不仅有共产党，而且有民主同盟和许多正义人士。参加这“国大”的，都被人民叫做“落水”，叫做
    “堕入妓院的火坑”。这个国大的猪仔们所“制定”的一部伪宪法，和曹锟猪仔国会的“宪法”，前后媲臭。
    袁世凯临死之前，想过一过皇帝瘾。蒋介石在滚去台湾以前也想过一过“总统”瘾。在这种贪欲支配下，在蒋管区里，又一次公布了一系列伪选举法规，又大闹了一番伪选。依伪国大代表选举法，选举“以普遍、平等、直接及无记名单记法投票行之”，“中华民国国民，年满二十岁，有选举权；年满二十三岁，有被选举权”。可是，重要的事情不在于蒋介石的条文如何写法，而在蒋记王朝的实际。从当时蒋管区刊物形形色色的报道中，大略列举几条来看吧：第一，蒋介石匪帮“中央的圈定办法规定了下来，无论是国大代表和立法委员，都绝对的控制”“一切指定，不但不能选择党，连党内也不许选择人。”这种圈定，“又称钦定”。第二，在选举之前，国民党青年党民社党三个反动党派，在伪政协的烟幕下，进行了几个月的分赃谈判，结果成立了互相退让，保证当选的强盗协议。第三，“某富翁为了竞选已经花了不少的钱，可是经过两次书面威胁，一次四个人上楼拿出手枪教训了他一顿，他就气馁退出竞选。”第四，“党官把工会的选举权证缴械后……各单位主管人负责凑出会写字的工人或杂役五十名，分别在两天投完三千一百五十张选某某的票。这五十名投票专家要吃饭，……因此要钱用，派投票事务费共四百万，摊到每一员工身上。”第五，在选举前，在选举人名册上，临时增加了一大批实际上并无其人的人，以凭多领选举权证。“选举证拿到之后，忙坏了刻图章的师傅。”第六，利用票贩子“包票”，每票五万元，一手交票，一手交钱。“大多数伪乡保长都有做票贩子的资格，扮演一个非常重要的角色”。第七，带了兵士四五百人到场投票，并在投票场门口大肆活动，“劝导”投某某的票。第八，据估计每个候选人所花活动费平均蒋币五亿元，“国大”和“立委”的名额约有二千左右，每一名额若干竞选人所耗费的活动费，假定最保守地以十亿元计，则合算起来，耗费当在两万亿元以上……一切蒙蔽、欺骗、收买、利诱、暗杀、械斗等手段全都利用了。光怪陆离的丑态，简直写不完。袁世凯曹锟的手段和这比起来，真是小巫见大巫了。
    伪选丑剧的结束，往往跟到来的是“王朝”灭亡，这是历史的逻辑。蒋介石披上了“总统”的寿衣后不久，就被人民的铁的扫帚扫出中国大陆了。
    中国工人阶级和中国人民通过了艰难曲折的途径，终于战胜了强大的帝国主义及其走狗在中国的统治。中华人民共和国成立以来，由于中国共产党和毛主席领导的正确，由于人民的努力，在各种战线上取得了伟大的胜利，已经为有计划的大规模进行经济建设和文化建设创造了必要的条件，同样也已经为实行真正普遍平等的选举制创造了必要的条件。民主和自由，在今天已成为现实。我们即将进行全国范围的史无前例的普选。历史的发展告诉我们：一切为反动统治阶级所利用的、虚伪的欺骗的选举制度必然破产，而获得胜利的、真正属于人民的是新民主主义的选举制度。
