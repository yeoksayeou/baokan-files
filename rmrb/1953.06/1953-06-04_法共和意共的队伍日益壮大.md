Xinhua News Agency, 3rd: The May 22nd edition of "For Lasting Peace, For People's Democracy!" reported: French working people, responding to the Communist Party's movement to recruit new members in commemoration of Comrade Stalin, enthusiastically joined the ranks of the Party.

    The movement to recruit new members is unfolding amidst the movement demanding the unity of the working class and the large-scale actions of working people to fight for the satisfaction of their immediate demands. By early May, the Seine Provincial Committee of the French Communist Party had already recruited 2,687 new members; the Seine-et-Oise Provincial Committee had recruited 827 new members; and other local Party organizations had recruited 10,000 new members.
    The Party organization in the Bouches-du-Rhône province achieved great success. On May Day, Party organizations there recruited 1,460 new members. The Party organization in the 4th district of Marseille recruited 236 new members in eight weeks.
    With the increase in Party members, new grassroots Party organizations are being established. For example, in the La Timone district of Marseille, five new factory Party groups were established on the day that André Stil, editor-in-chief of "l'Humanité," trade union leader Lucion Molino, and André Doé were arrested.
    Xinhua News Agency, 3rd: According to "For Lasting Peace, For People's Democracy!," the Italian Communist Party Central Committee's movement to recruit 100,000 new members in commemoration of Stalin is expanding. The Communist Party's active struggle, standing at the forefront of democratic forces against deceptive election laws, has promoted the development of this movement.
    Within twenty days of the start of the movement in March, according to incomplete materials, 15,357 progressive workers had joined the Party.
    Party organizations in various places achieved further successes in April. In seven days, fourteen of the one hundred and thirty district committees of the Party in Naples recruited a total of 200 workers into the Party. In the process of recruiting new members, many new district committees were established.

    法共和意共的队伍日益壮大
    【新华社三日讯】五月二十二日出版的“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”报道：法国劳动人民响应共产党为纪念斯大林同志而发动的吸收新党员运动，踊跃参加了党的队伍。
    吸收新党员的运动是在要求工人阶级团结一致的运动中、在劳动人民为争取满足其切身要求的大规模行动中展开的。到五月初，法国共产党塞纳省委员会已经吸收了二千六百八十七个新党员；塞纳—瓦斯省委员会吸收了八百二十七个新党员；其他地方的党组织吸收了一万个新党员。
    罗尼河口省的党组织取得了巨大的成就。在“五一”节这一天，党的各个组织就吸收了一千四百六十个新党员。马赛第四选区的党组织在八个星期里吸收了二百三十六个新党员。
    随着党员的增加，新的基层党组织纷纷成立。例如马赛的拉蒂蒙纳区，在“人道报”总编辑安德烈·斯梯、工会领袖吕希欧·摩林诺和安德烈·道埃被捕的那一天，就成立了五个新的工厂党小组。
    【新华社三日讯】据“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”报道：意大利共产党中央委员会为纪念斯大林而发动的征收十万新党员的运动，规模日益扩大。共产党站在民主力量前面、反对骗人选举法的积极斗争，促进了这一运动的发展。
    在三月份运动开始后二十天内，根据不完全的材料，就已有一万五千三百五十七个进步的劳动者入党。
    各地党组织在四月间获得了进一步的成就。在七天中，党在那不勒斯的一百三十个区委中，有十四个区委共吸收了二百名劳动者入党。在征收新党员的过程中，成立了许多新的区委。
