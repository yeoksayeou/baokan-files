Xinhua News Agency, May 31st dispatch from Moscow: Pravda recently published a travelogue about Thailand by O. Orestov. In the article, the author reveals that the Thai rulers, with the support of the United States government, are expanding their military and preparing for war. He points out that Thailand's military and police maintenance costs were 488.7 million baht in 1950, but have increased to 1.4919 billion baht this year.

Orestov writes that Thailand is being dragged, day by day, into the imperialists' plans to destroy the national liberation movements in Malaya and Indochina. The Thai military is preparing to stand on the side of the French armed forces and interfere in Indochina's affairs. Recently, the "Bangkok Tribune" and "Nangsuephim Thai" reported that Thailand has promised to send 8,000 soldiers this year to help the French occupation forces in Indochina. According to Burmese newspaper reports, the remnants of Chiang Kai-shek's bandits, who are running rampant in Burma, are using the Thai border as their rear base. They unscrupulously enter Thailand, obtain weapons and other military supplies, medicines, and food, and then sneak back into Burma. Not long ago, the Kuomintang remnants launched an offensive against southern Burma from Thai territory.

Orestov points out that the United States is systematically transporting airplanes, tanks, cars, weapons, and ammunition to Thailand; it has even promised to transport jet aircraft. A large number of military advisors and instructors from foreign countries are stirring up artificial war hysteria, placing a heavy burden on the people.

Orestov writes that farmers in southern and northeastern Thailand are starving, while Thai rice is being shipped to Korea free of charge to meet the needs of the "United Nations Forces." Many Thai farmers have been driven out of areas where military facilities are being built. "Thai Voice" reported that rice fields cultivated by farmers in seven districts of Pathum Thani Province have been confiscated to build barracks; farmland of farmers in Nakhon Sawan Province has also been requisitioned to build military airports.

Xinhua News Agency, May 31st dispatch from Bangkok: The "Bangkok Post" reported that a batch of weapons, ammunition, and other military supplies for use by the Thai armed forces arrived in Bangkok on May 22nd by special ship. This batch of military supplies was transported from an American supply base in the Pacific region by the "Gerritse Victory" ship. As a result, Thailand has received a total of six ships of military supplies in May.

Prior to this, many American military supplies had been transported by air to Don Mueang Airport for use by the Thai army and police.

    美国指使泰国进行扩军备战
    妄想利用泰国干涉东南亚人民的斗争
    【新华社三十一日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：真理报最近刊载了奥·奥列斯托夫的一篇泰国旅途随笔，作者在文章中揭露泰国统治者在美国政府支持下扩军备战的情况，指出泰国的军警维持费在一九五○年是四亿八千八百七十万铢，而在今年已增为十四亿九千一百九十万铢。
    奥列斯托夫写道，泰国正在一天一天被拖进力图摧毁马来亚和印度支那的民族解放运动的帝国主义者的计划中去。泰国军方正在准备站在法国武装部队一边，干预印度支那的事情。最近“曼谷论坛报”和“南锡平卓报”报道，泰国已答应在今年派遣八千士兵去帮助在印度支那的法国占领军。根据缅甸报纸的消息，在缅甸胡作非为的蒋介石残匪，正以泰国国境作为他们的后方基地。他们肆无忌惮地走进泰国境内，取得许多武器和其他军用品、医药和粮食然后窜回缅甸。不久以前，国民党残匪就是从泰国国土向缅甸南部进攻的。
    奥列斯托夫指出，美国正在有计划地把飞机、坦克、汽车、武器和弹药运往泰国；甚至还答应把喷气式飞机运去。从外国派来的大批军事顾问和教官在煽起人为的战争歇斯底里，使人民感受到沉重的负担。
    奥列斯托夫写道，泰国南部和东北部的农民处在饥馑中，而泰国大米却在免费运往朝鲜，以满足“联合国军”的需要。泰国许多农民从建立军事设备的地区被赶出，“泰声报”报道巴吞尼府七个县的农民所耕种的稻田都被没收来建筑兵营；北榄坡府的农民耕地也被征用来建筑军用飞机场。
    【新华社三十一日讯】塔斯社曼谷二十九日电：“曼谷邮报”报道，供给泰国武装部队使用的一批武器、弹药和其他军用品，在五月二十二日由专船运抵曼谷。这批军火是由“杰利兆胜利号”轮船从太平洋区域一个美国供给基地赶运来泰国的。这样一来，泰国在五月份已共收到六艘轮船的军火。
    在这以前，已有许多美国军火由飞机运抵廊曼飞机场，以供给泰国军队和警察使用。
