To coordinate with the nation's large-scale economic construction, the postal and telecommunications departments are gradually strengthening postal and telecommunications work in basic construction sites and factories and mining areas. In the past, although the postal and telecommunications departments had done some work in this area, such as organizing two temporary postal and telecommunications bureaus and some temporary service groups at the Huai River management construction site; setting up three temporary post offices at the Tianlan Railway construction site; establishing many service groups and agency offices near other basic construction sites; and focusing on erecting some lines in telecommunications and opening telegraph and telephone services in large industrial and mining areas; and sending hundreds of radio stations to the Huai River management, flood control, Fengfeng Mining Area, Changzhi Mining Area, and geological survey teams to undertake telegraph communications, etc., the objective needs were far from being met. This was because the postal and telecommunications departments had made mistakes in the past in their guiding ideology for operations, holding one-sided task views and one-sided profit-seeking views, and did not have enough understanding of the economic construction situation. For example, at the Anshan construction site, workers had to wait for several hours to remit money or send registered letters, so they had to ask for leave to stand in line. Last year, workers at many construction sites in the suburbs of Beijing had to ask for leave to come to the city to mail letters and remit money; and the business hours of the post office branches in the city were the same as the workers' hours, so the workers made a wasted trip when they came to remit money after work. After reviewing the biases in their work this time, the postal and telecommunications departments have criticized and begun to change their erroneous management thinking, and have realized that the postal and telecommunications departments should vigorously cooperate with the needs of construction sites and factory and mining areas for postal and telecommunications services, and better serve basic construction. At present, the postal and telecommunications departments are comprehensively strengthening this aspect of their work. For example, in Anshan, in addition to adding necessary business locations and increasing service personnel, they are also preparing to install 1,600 automatic telephone exchange equipment. In order to meet the needs of workers at basic construction sites in the suburbs, the Beijing Post Office has specially organized mobile post offices to patrol and serve various construction sites, which has been welcomed by the vast number of workers. The Tianjin Post Office has specially set up a post office at the Wangchuanchang construction site and conducted radio propaganda to explain the address of the post office, the business handled, and general business knowledge, which has made the workers feel extremely convenient. The Tianjin Post Office has also organized mobile service groups for dozens of brickyards in the suburbs, taking turns to serve each brickyard and maintaining close contact with the trade unions of each brickyard, agreeing on the dates of service, and leaving remittance forms, purchase order forms, and insured envelopes in advance so that workers can fill them out earlier, so as to avoid temporary confusion and congestion and save time. The Shanxi Provincial Postal and Telecommunications Administration, the Hebei Provincial Postal and Telecommunications Administration, the Songjiang Provincial Postal and Telecommunications Administration, and the Taiyuan Post Office have all focused on strengthening the postal and telecommunications work in basic construction sites and factory and mining areas, which has been supported by the workers. Many model postal and telecommunications workers have been called "living post kiosks" by the workers. The postal and telecommunications business has also been generally developed as a result, with the postal and telecommunications business in the first quarter exceeding the original plan by 23%.

However, the postal and telecommunications work in basic construction and factory and mining areas should be further strengthened. Some postal and telecommunications cadres have not yet regarded this work as a priority. Some believe that strengthening the work can only be done by increasing personnel and setting up more bureaus, so they simply ask the higher authorities to increase personnel and invest in building bureaus, and do not pay enough attention to how to adjust labor organization, improve work, and maximize the efficiency of postal and telecommunications bureaus and postal and telecommunications workers.

    邮电部门配合有计划的经济建设
    加强工地和工矿地区的邮电工作
    邮电部门为配合国家大规模的经济建设，正逐步加强基本建设工地和工厂矿区的邮电工作。过去邮电部门虽然在这方面做了一些工作，如在治淮工地组织了两个临时邮电局和一些临时服务组；在天兰铁路工地曾设了三个临时邮局；在其他基本建设工地附近设立了不少服务组和代办所；电信方面也曾经重点地架设了一些线路，开放大工矿区的电报电话；向治淮、防汛、峰峰矿区、长治矿区及地质勘测队等派出了数以百计的电台，担负电报通信等，但由于过去邮电部门在经营指导思想上犯有片面任务观点和片面营利观点的错误，对经济建设情况也了解不够，还远远未能满足客观的需要。如在鞍山工地，工人们因为汇款或寄挂号信要等几个钟头，因而不得不请假去站队。北京郊区许多建筑工地的工人去年曾因寄信汇款要请假到城里来；而城里各邮政支局上下班时间和工人一样，工人下了班来汇款结果白跑一趟。邮电部门这次检查了工作中的偏向之后，已经批判并开始转变错误的经营思想，并认识到邮电部门应该大力配合工地和工厂矿区对邮电的需要，更好地为基本建设服务。目前邮电部门正在全面加强这一方面的工作，如在鞍山除了增设必要的营业处增加服务人员外，并准备加装一千六百号自动电话交换机设备。北京邮局为了满足郊区基本建设工地工人的需要，专门组织了行动邮局，分别巡回到各工地服务，得到了广大工人的欢迎。天津邮局专门在王串场工地设立了一个邮局，并进行广播宣传，说明邮局的地址、经办业务及业务常识等，使工人感到极大方便。天津邮局对市郊的几十个窑厂还组织了流动服务组，分班轮流去各窑厂服务，并和各窑厂工会取得了密切的联系，约定来服务的日期，预先留下汇票请购单、保价信封等以便工人早些填好，免得临时忙乱拥挤，节省时间。山西省邮电管理局，河北省邮电管理局，松江省邮电管理局，太原邮局等都着重加强了基本建设工地和工厂矿区的邮电工作，得到工人的拥护，许多模范邮电职工被工人称为“活邮亭”。邮电业务也因此普遍得到发展，第一季度的邮电业务已超过原计划百分之二十三。
    但目前基本建设与厂矿地区的邮电工作还应进一步加强。部分邮电干部还没有把这一工作当作重点，有的认为要加强工作只有增加人员，多设局，因而单纯向上级要求增加人员和建局投资，对如何调整劳动组织、改进工作，发挥邮电局所和邮电职工的最大效率重视不够。
