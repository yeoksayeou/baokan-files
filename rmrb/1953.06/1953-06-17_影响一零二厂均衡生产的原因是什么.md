What are the Reasons Affecting Balanced Production at Factory 102?
Wang Wei
Although Chongqing State-owned Factory 102 completed its production tasks for the first quarter and April this year, it did so under very unbalanced conditions. As the workers said, "We produce at the beginning of the month, step up production in the middle of the month, and desperately produce at the end of the month!" Taking the production situation of the main steelmaking workshop in April as an example: the first ten days completed 22.53 percent of the total monthly production task, the middle ten days completed 30.99 percent, and the last ten days completed 54.08 percent. Looking at the completion of varieties, the balance rate of steel ingots in the first quarter was 94 percent, and steel材was 82 percent; in the first quarter, the monthly balance rate also showed a situation of being loose at the beginning and tight at the end.

Why has Factory 102 had an unbalanced production situation for a long time? Objectively, because the monthly orders are almost determined at the end of the month or even the beginning of the next month, and the tasks are constantly changing, there are no reserves for the turnover of steel ingots and steel billets; on the other hand, the products have many varieties and are complex, with 148 kinds of products in April, so it is not easy to master the specifications and technical aspects of the products.

There are also imbalances between workshops. For example, the billet opening capacity of workshop four is about twice the steelmaking capacity of workshop two, while the steel rolling capacity of workshop three cannot meet the needs of workshop two; moreover, workshop three's own production is also unbalanced. According to preliminary estimates, the utilization rate of existing equipment in workshop three's rolling mill before April only reached 48.71 percent, while the capacity of workshop three's steel heating furnace can only meet half of the utilization rate requirements of the existing equipment of the rolling mill.

However, the more important reason affecting balanced production is the weakness and chaos of planning management.

From the perspective of work plans, the leadership did not pay attention to them in the past, and some workshops did not even have work plans. The general work plan, because there is no correct quota and original record as a basis, and it has not been seriously discussed by the masses, is only formulated by the production section based on the production situation of the previous month, relying on the estimates of the workshop director and planner. In addition, the work of the production section is not sound, and there is a lack of necessary statistical charts and balance charts, so the formulated work plan is not accurate. For example, when the production section arranged the work plan for workshop three in April, it underestimated the proficiency of the workshop workers in rolling silicon-manganese steel, so the original planned target was very conservative. After discussion by the masses, it was increased by 13 percent, and the actual completion number exceeded the revised plan by 4 percent. Such a work plan, of course, loses its role in guiding production.

The problems existing in the work plan expose the fact that the original records are very unsound. On the one hand, because of the lack of necessary measuring tools, the records are inaccurate. For example, there is no second hand on the clock in workshop four, and workers count "one, two, three" to calculate seconds, so the time record for rolling steel is inaccurate; sometimes the scale is inaccurate, and there have been strange phenomena where the steel材 after opening the billet and rolling is more than the steel billet, and the steel billet is more than the steel ingot. On the other hand, there is a lack of necessary political education and business education for grassroots recorders. According to statistics, out of 113 grassroots recorders in the factory, 103 are part-time, and most of them are not at ease with the recording work. In addition, they lack business knowledge, some record what should not be recorded, and do not record what should be recorded, even tampering with records, arbitrarily increasing or decreasing the consumption records of raw materials, and recording output and quality based on subjective guesswork. In addition, the entire original record lacks technical records, so there is no basis for formulating technical measures. In short, the current original records cannot meet the requirements of statistics, analysis, and research.

The chaos in scheduling and the phenomenon of no one being responsible also make the implementation of the work plan lack a definite guarantee. Because the scheduling work lacks a special organization and a unified system, it is very passive. It is not the scheduling that directs production, but production that dominates scheduling. The production section, which is responsible for scheduling, not only cannot control the production situation of the entire factory, but even does not know enough about the products of the workshop by the end of the month; therefore, it only solves the problem when it occurs and is brought to its attention; because there is no preparation when solving the problem, it has to rob Peter to pay Paul, disrupting the progress of production. For example, the cold-drawn steel材, a newly manufactured product of workshop seven, was delayed by a month compared to the original plan because the preparation of the mold and the scheduling work were not done well. In addition, the scope of scheduling is too narrow. At present, it generally only considers the scheduling of steel, and the allocation of labor, the allocation of electricity, and the allocation of raw materials are not mentioned. In the past, it often happened that when preparing to smelt a certain kind of steel, it was temporarily discovered that there was no certain raw material, so it had to be stopped or changed. The failure to solve the supply problem of石白bricks and low-silicon iron powder in April in a timely manner affected the furnace repair work, resulting in the unbalanced situation of loose at the beginning and tight at the end of the steelmaking workshop production in April. The workshop itself also often affects the normal progress of production due to poor scheduling and coordination between work sections and processes. Workshop two often wastes a lot of production time and disrupts the work plan due to improper scheduling of the crane, the scheduling of steel grades, and the cooperation between the steel blowing furnace and the steelmaking furnace.

In addition, the unsound inspection and testing system also affects the balance of production. Most of the many major accidents that occurred in the factory were due to the lack of a sound machine equipment inspection and maintenance system. The balanced production rate of workshop four in the first ten days of April was 90.95 percent, but in the last ten days, the equilibrium rate dropped to 74.99 percent due to an accident with the steam hammer, which affected billet opening. Because workshop two was rushing to complete the task and grab output at the end of the month, there was no normal furnace repair and maintenance plan. The furnace repair time increased at the beginning of the month, which affected production, so the equilibrium rate in the first ten days of April only reached 69.98 percent. The product inspection problem has not been well resolved for a long time. Sometimes it is only determined that the product is not up to standard when it is about to leave the factory, so it has to be re-smelted and re-rolled temporarily. This not only caused the situation of being loose at the beginning and tight at the end, but also disrupted the original plan.

The above situation shows that to achieve balanced production, it is necessary to establish planning management. The factory leadership is now consciously asking workers to discuss the problem of unbalanced production when discussing the June production plan, in addition to discussing production targets, based on the problems in planning management revealed and exposed by the workers in the discussion of the plan and the anti-bureaucracy campaign, and to establish a collective concept of unity, mutual assistance, and obedience to scheduling among the workers; discuss the shortcomings of original records and study ways to overcome these shortcomings.

Facts have proved that mobilizing the masses to discuss the plan is an important method to realize planning management. For example, after the workers in workshop two revealed the chaos and the phenomenon of no one being responsible for the furnace repair and maintenance work during the discussion of the plan, the administration promptly appointed a dedicated engineer and foreman to be responsible for the furnace repair work, and initially formulated the responsibility system for furnace repair based on the opinions of the workers. Therefore, the furnace overhaul in May was reduced from the highest 52 hours in the past to 19 to 21 hours, breaking the quota and overcoming the phenomenon of loose at the beginning and tight at the end caused by furnace repair.

The factory administration is now focusing on rectifying original records, mobilizing the masses to discuss and revise quotas, planning to establish a scheduling organization, and opening training classes for dispatchers; and establishing various responsibility systems through the above work.

    影响一零二厂均衡生产的原因是什么
    王纬
    重庆国营一零二厂虽然完成了今年第一季同四月份的生产任务，但是在一种很不均衡的情况下完成的。正如工人们所说：“我们是月初生产，月中加紧生产，月底拚命生产！”以主要的炼钢车间四月份的生产情况来看：上旬完成全月生产任务的百分之二十二点五三，中旬完成百分之三十点九九，下旬完成百分之五十四点零八。再以品种完成的情况来看，第一季度钢锭的均衡率为百分之九十四，钢材为百分之八十二；第一季中，每月均衡率的情况也显得前松后紧。
    为什么一零二厂生产上长期存在着不均衡的状况呢？在客观上，由于每月订货差不多要在月底甚至下月初才能确定，而且任务经常变动，以致钢锭、钢胚的周转没有储备；另一方面，产品的花色多，种类复杂，四月份的产品达到一百四十八种，因而对产品的规格、技术方面不易掌握。
    车间与车间也存在着不平衡的情况，如四场的开胚能力约大过二场炼钢能力的一倍，而三场的轧钢能力又不能满足二场的需要；而且三场本身的生产也不平衡，据初步测定，四月以前三场轧钢机的现有设备利用率只达到百分之四十八点七一，而三场烘钢炉的能力，又只能满足轧钢机现有设备利用率的要求的一半。
    但是，影响生产均衡更主要的原因，是计划管理的薄弱与混乱。
    从作业计划来看，过去领导不重视，有的车间甚至连作业计划都没有。一般的作业计划，因为没有正确的定额与原始记录作为依据，又没有认真通过群众讨论，只是生产科根据上月的生产情况，依靠车间主任与计划员的估计而订出的，加以生产科的工作不健全，缺乏必要的统计图表与平衡图表，所以制订出来的作业计划不确切。如四月份生产科排三场的作业计划时，对车间工人轧矽锰钢的熟练程度估计不足，所以原订的计划指标很保守，经群众讨论后提高了百分之十三，而实际完成数又较修订计划超过百分之四。像这种作业计划当然失掉了指导生产的作用。
    作业计划上存在的问题，暴露出原始记录很不健全。一方面因为缺乏必要的量具，所以记录不准确。如四场时钟上没有秒针，工人凭嘴数“一、二、三”来计算秒，结果轧制钢的时间记录便不准确；有时磅秤不准，发生过钢锭经过开胚、轧制后，钢材多于钢胚，钢胚多于钢锭的奇怪现象。另一方面，对基层记录员缺乏必要的政治教育与业务教育。据统计，全厂一百一十三个基层记录员，一百零三个是兼职的，他们大都不安心记录工作。加以缺乏业务知识，有的不该记的记了，该记的没有记，甚至涂改记录，任意增减原材料的消耗记录，对产量、质量凭主观猜想记录等等。此外整个原始记录中又缺乏技术性的记录，因而制订技术措施时，缺乏依据。总之，目前的原始记录不能满足统计、分析与研究的要求。
    调度上的紊乱与无人负责现象，也使作业计划的执行没有确切的保证。调度工作因为没有专门的机构与统一的制度，所以很被动，不是调度指挥生产，而是生产支配调度。负责调度的生产科，不但控制不住全厂的生产情况，甚至到月底时对车间的产品都不够了解；所以一直到问题发生，找上门来才去解决；解决时因为没有准备，所以只好挖东墙补西墙，把生产的进度打乱了。如七场新制产品冷拉钢材，因为模子的准备与调度工作未作好，以致较原计划拖延了一个月。另外，调度的范围太狭小，目前一般仅仅顾及钢的调度，至于劳动力的调配、电力的调配、原材料等调配就谈不到了。过去往往准备冶炼某种钢，临时发现因为没有某种原材料，只好停炼或改炼。四月份石白砖与低矽铁粉的供应问题没有及时解决，影响修炉工作，以致造成四月份炼钢车间生产上前松后紧的不均衡状况。车间本身也往往因为工段与工段、工序与工序的调度与配合不好，影响生产正常进行。二场常常因为行车的调度、钢色的调度，吹钢炉与炼钢炉的配合不当，耽误很多生产时间，打乱作业计划。
    此外检修与检验制度不健全，也影响生产的均衡。全厂发生的许多重大事故，其中大部分是因为没有健全的机器设备检修与维护制度。四场四月上旬生产均衡率为百分之九十点九五，但下旬因为汽锤发生事故，影响开胚，均衡率便降为百分之七十四点九九。二场因为月终赶任务，抢产量，没有正常的修炉护炉计划，到月初修炉时间增多，影响生产，所以四月上旬的均衡率只达到百分之六十九点九八。产品的检验问题，长期没有得到很好的解决，有时直到产品要出厂时，才判定出来不合规格，只好临时补炼补轧。这样不但造成前松后紧，也打乱了原来的计划。
    从以上情况说明，要达到均衡生产，必须建立计划管理。工厂领导上现正根据工人在讨论计划与反官僚主义中揭发与暴露出来的计划管理上的问题，有意识地要工人在讨论六月份生产计划时，除了讨论生产指标外，还着重讨论生产不均衡问题，在工人中树立团结互助、服从调度的整体观念；讨论原始记录的缺点，研究克服这些缺点的办法。
    事实证明，发动群众讨论计划是实现计划管理的重要方法。如二场工人在讨论计划时，揭发修炉护炉工作的紊乱与无人负责现象后，行政上及时指定专责工程师与工长负责修炉工作，根据工人意见初步订出修炉的责任制，因此五月份炉子中修便由过去最高的五十二小时降低到十九小时至二十一小时，突破了定额，也克服了因修炉而造成的前松后紧现象。
    工厂行政上现正着手重点整顿原始记录，发动群众讨论修订定额，筹划建立调度组织，开办调度员训练班；并通过以上工作建立各种责任制。 （原载重庆新华日报）
