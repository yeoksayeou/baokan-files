Xinhua News Agency, June 15th: Tokyo dispatch: The evening of the 14th was the deadline set by the Yoshida government for the people of Uchinada Village in Ishikawa Prefecture to move out of the U.S. military firing range area. The struggle of the people of Uchinada Village against the Yoshida government's forced seizure of Uchinada Village is also becoming increasingly intense.

On the 14th, the Yoshida government dispatched 700 armed police to patrol around the U.S. military firing range in Uchinada Village, attempting to suppress the local people's resistance by force and forcibly implement the shameful decision to allow the U.S. military to begin target practice in Uchinada Village from the 15th. At noon on the 14th, when the Uchinada Village Council held an emergency meeting to decide whether to accept the Yoshida government's decision to designate Uchinada Village as a permanent firing range for the U.S. military, the Yoshida government actually ordered 50 armed police wearing helmets to rush into the meeting place, attempting to suppress the local people's opposition in order to force the Village Council to make a decision that violated the people's will. The police also injured several demonstrating members of the public on the spot. Prior to this, the Yoshida government had already injured a demonstrator on the evening of the 13th.

However, the Yoshida government's tyrannical suppression cannot suppress the fighting will of the people of Uchinada Village, who are fighting bravely with the support and encouragement of the broad masses of the Japanese people. From early morning on the 14th, about 200 residents of Uchinada Village conducted a sit-down protest outside the main gate of the firing range. They sat on the scorching sand, holding up straw mats with slogans written on them such as "Swear to Defend Uchinada," protesting the Yoshida government's traitorous decision to permanently allocate Uchinada Village to the U.S. military as a firing range. Members of the National Railway Workers' Union and other trade unions, about 300 people, came to Uchinada Village early in the morning to support and encourage the local people's struggle. Representatives of the All-Japan Federation of Student Self-Government Associations and students from Doshisha University also came to support and participate in the local people's sit-down protest. The Hokuriku Railway Workers' Union held an emergency meeting of its executive committee on the 14th and decided to intensify the implementation of its decision to refuse to transport military supplies destined for the Uchinada firing range from noon on the 14th.

Xinhua News Agency, June 15th: Tokyo dispatch: Japanese workers employed by the U.S. occupation forces in Japan are opposing the U.S. making Japan a military base and demanding the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Japan.

The All-Japan Garrison Forces Union, which has 80,000 members, held its eighth regular congress on May 30th and 31st. The congress decided that the fighting policy for this year is: to defend peace, oppose rearmament, demand the revision of the U.S.-Japan "Administrative Agreement," oppose the U.S. making Japan a military base, and oppose infringement on trade union rights, etc. The congress also put forward demands such as paying retirement allowances in cash before the effective date of the San Francisco Peace Treaty and opposing unfair revisions of labor contracts.

Prior to this, the Hiroshima Prefecture branch of the union held a congress on May 24th. Discussions were centered on the issue of the withdrawal of U.S. troops stationed in Japan. The congress unanimously agreed that U.S. troops stationed in Japan should withdraw immediately. The Gunma Prefecture branch of the union also recently passed a resolution stipulating that upholding peace and independence, opposing rearmament, and opposing conscription should be the fighting policies for the future.

    绝不允许自己的田园变成美军的打靶场
    日本内滩村人民在工会支援下坚持斗争
    【新华社十五日讯】东京消息：十四日晚是吉田政府迫令石川县内滩村人民移出美军打靶场区域的最后限期。内滩村人民反对吉田政府强制接收内滩村的斗争也正越来越强烈。
    吉田政府在十四日派出了七百名武装警察到内滩村美军打靶场周围巡逻，企图以武力镇压当地人民的反抗，强制执行自十五日起让美军在内滩村开始打靶的可耻决定。十四日中午，当内滩村村议会举行紧急会议，决定是否接受吉田政府将内滩村划作美军永久的打靶场的决定时，吉田政府竟命令五十名头戴钢盔的武装警察冲入会场，企图压制当地人民的反对，以便迫使村议会作出违反人民意志的决定。警察并当场殴伤示威的群众数人。在这以前，吉田政府已经在十三日晚打伤了一个示威群众。
    但是，吉田政府的横暴镇压并不能压制内滩村人民的斗争意志，他们正在日本广大人民的支援和鼓舞下英勇地斗争。从十四日一早起，内滩村居民约二百人就在打靶场的正门外进行静坐斗争，他们高举写着“誓死保卫内滩”的口号的草席坐在灼热的沙滩上，抗议吉田政府将内滩村永久划给美军做打靶场的卖国决定。国营铁道工会和其他一些工会的会员约三百人一早就来到内滩村，支援和鼓舞当地人民的斗争。全日本学生自治会总联合会的代表和同志社大学学生也前来支援和参加当地人民的静坐斗争。北陆铁道工人工会在十四日举行了执行委员会紧急会议，决定从十四日中午起加紧实行拒绝运输送往内滩打靶场的军用物资的决定。
    【新华社十五日讯】东京消息：美国驻日本占领军雇用的日本工人，反对美国使日本军事基地化，要求美军撤离日本。
    拥有会员八万人的全日本驻军工会在五月三十日和三十一日两天召开第八次定期大会。大会决定本年度的斗争方针是：保卫和平，反对重整军备，要求修改美日“行政协定”，反对美国使日本军事基地化和反对侵害工会权益等。大会并提出以现款支付旧金山和约生效以前的退职金和反对不公平地修改劳工合同等要求。
    在此以前，该工会的广岛县分会曾于五月二十四日举行大会。会上以驻日美军撤离日本问题为中心，进行了讨论。大会一致认为，美国驻军应该立即撤离日本。该工会的群马县分会也在不久前作出决议，规定以拥护和平和独立、反对重整军备、反对征兵等作为今后的斗争方针。
