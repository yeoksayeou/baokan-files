Newspaper Work Review

    Deepen the Publicity of Typical Good People and Good Deeds
    In recent months, the resolute struggle carried out by newspapers in various regions against bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of law and discipline has not only greatly encouraged the political enthusiasm of the people but also greatly improved the political and ideological level of the broad masses of cadres, enabling them to deeply realize that these bad phenomena are the remnants of the reactionary ruling class's bureaucratic style reflected within our Party and the People's Government. It is necessary to resolutely overcome these bad work styles to effectively serve the people. But how to establish a correct work style? This is not a problem that has been completely solved for every cadre. On the contrary, a fairly common feeling of "bureaucracy and forced orders are wrong, but the mass line is not understood" exists among many cadres, especially grassroots cadres. This requires our newspapers, after focusing on exposing some typical bad people and bad deeds, to not only closely integrate the anti-bureaucracy struggle with daily work and carry it out regularly but also pay attention to commending typical good people and good deeds, so that all Party members and cadres and the masses can learn from these good examples, promote righteousness, and overcome evil. Shandong Dazhong Daily, Liaoxi Daily, Hebei Daily, New Hunan Daily, Nanjing Xinhua Daily, Henan Daily, and other newspapers have noticed the publicity in this area, among which Shandong Dazhong Daily and Liaoxi Daily have achieved more success.
    Shandong Dazhong Daily conducted timely and extensive commendation of typical good people and good deeds. After exposing typical bad people and bad deeds such as the "Bai Chunxi Incident," the "Zhao Wangtang Village Incident," and the "Maggot-Infested Patient Zhang Kejing Death Incident," as the anti-bureaucracy struggle in Shandong deepened, the newspaper began in April to cooperate with the continued development of the anti-bureaucracy struggle, while continuously reporting typical good people and good deeds from various regions that could embody the correct work style and work methods of the Party and the People's Government. Most of them were commendations of grassroots cadres and grassroots organizations. For example, commending Wang Yuhuai, the township head of Wanli Township in Zhucheng County, Chen Weilan, the district head of the 12th District of Fei County, and the Party General Branch of Taoyuan Township in Jiaohe County, etc. This is entirely necessary. Because the vast number of grassroots cadres and grassroots organizations need to learn the viewpoint of serving the people wholeheartedly and the work methods of the mass line from concrete and vivid examples. However, Dazhong Daily has also not neglected to commend typical good people and good deeds among leading cadres in leading organs, especially typical good people and good deeds that are closely combined with the current central work. For example, on April 8, the newspaper prominently reported that the Junan County Party Committee changed its general leadership style, systematically summarized the land improvement experience of turning thin land into fertile land, and the experience of improving farming techniques centered on seedling protection, thereby finding the key to further increasing production. The newspaper also published an editorial for this purpose, calling on various regions to learn from the leadership methods of the Junan County Party Committee,
    "Immediately go deep into the current spring plowing and production campaign, go to the front line of agricultural production, be determined to delve into it, study and solve specific problems in production, concentrate the creativity of the masses, summarize and analyze the experience of the masses, grasp the key to increasing production in the local area, and correctly guide the spring plowing and production campaign." Then, in the editorials on spring sowing and drought resistance on April 19 and May 8, the newspaper repeatedly proposed to promote and apply the mass line work methods of the Junan County Party Committee and other units to the current production leadership. The newspaper also carried out powerful publicity on the model examples of the Guangrao County Party Committee discovering the experience of resisting alkali and protecting land, and the Licheng County Party Committee creating good methods for production and disaster relief, which all came "from the masses and went to the masses." After newspaper publicity, these typical good people and good deeds were not only learned by many regions but also became a force to promote current work. As the newspaper pointed out in its May 26 editorial summarizing spring production, the most important reason why spring production in Shandong Province this year has been going well is that the work style of leaders and cadres at all levels has undergone major changes, specific leadership has been strengthened, and the mass line has been adopted.
    Working method.
    Liaoxi Daily's publicity on typical good people and good deeds was more concentrated and powerful. On March 22, the newspaper published the news that the Liaoxi Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial People's Government had severely dealt with the serious violations of law and discipline by village chief Bao Haishan and other bad elements in Fulongshan Village, Sixth District, Jinxi County, and then continuously published letters from the vast number of readers criticizing this incident and supporting the Party and government leading organs in severely dealing with bad people and bad deeds. On April 5, the newspaper also published an editorial entitled "Correctly Learn the Lessons of the 'Fulongshan Incident'," further clarifying the policy boundaries of the anti-bureaucracy struggle and criticizing the negative thoughts and emotions of some district and village cadres who were afraid of taking responsibility for their work and being punished in the anti-bureaucracy struggle. After continuously criticizing this typical bad people and bad deeds, the newspaper reported on April 8 in a prominent position on the example of Tong Yulan, the Party branch secretary and model village cadre of Litun Village, First District, Beizhen County, who cared about the lives and suffering of the masses and led the masses in struggle and production with the work method of the mass line, and published the decision of the Provincial People's Government to reward Litun Village and Tong Yulan, and also published an editorial calling on district and village cadres to learn from Tong Yulan. Then, a special column "Learning Tong Yulan's Correct Work Style and Work Methods" was opened to continuously report on Tong Yulan's model deeds and the effect of district and village cadres learning from Tong Yulan. Liaoxi Daily vigorously exposed typical bad people and bad deeds, and then strongly publicized typical good people and good deeds, which clearly delineated the boundaries between good and bad, right and wrong for the vast number of district and village cadres, and specifically pointed out the direction of their efforts. Therefore, once Tong Yulan's model deeds were publicized in the newspaper, it naturally set off a wave of learning among the vast number of cadres. Liaoxi Daily focused on reporting the effect of this learning to promote more people to participate in the learning. For example, on the same day that the Party branch of Baitaizi Village, 11th District, Jin County, received the newspaper, it organized Party members, village cadres, etc. to study. The branch organization committee member and the village women's association director kept the newspaper containing Tong Yulan's deeds in their pockets all day long, and took it out to study whenever they had time. Chen Shuli happily said after studying: "This time, after studying Tong Yulan's work style and work methods, I have found the direction and have confidence in my work." The learning method adopted by the Party branch of Suotun Village, Fourth District, Beizhen County, was: study while checking, and act while checking. For example, if the statistics committee member was afraid of difficulties in his work, he would specifically study how Tong Yulan overcame difficulties and did a good job; if the civil affairs committee member could not carry out criticism and self-criticism, he would specifically study how Tong Yulan checked his shortcomings and corrected his shortcomings. At that time, agricultural production in Liaoxi Province was facing the threat of spring drought, so Tong Yulan's mass line work method of leading the masses of Litun Village to divert water for irrigation quickly became the most practical learning content for district and village cadres throughout the province. After learning about Tong Yulan's deeds, Cai Xingyou, the Party branch secretary of Xinglongshan Village, Third District, Zhangwu County, and Liu Delin, the organization committee member, seriously examined the shortcomings of not following the mass line in the past work of the branch with the spirit of criticism and self-criticism, and then mobilized the masses to use river water for irrigation, so that more than 500 hectares of land in the village were exempted from the threat of spring drought, creating new experience and setting a new example for the province to carry out mass small-scale water conservancy. Liaoxi Daily made many timely reports on examples of promoting drought resistance work by learning Tong Yulan's work methods.
    The publicity of Dazhong Daily and Liaoxi Daily on typical good people and good deeds proved that vivid examples have the greatest persuasive power; as long as newspapers are good at grasping such examples and carrying out powerful publicity, they can produce the widest social impact. When the struggle to oppose bad people and bad deeds reaches a certain stage, the timely use of the examples of good people and good deeds by newspapers to educate the vast number of cadres will greatly help them to effectively overcome bureaucracy and commandism. Therefore, our newspapers, especially those newspapers in areas where the anti-bureaucracy struggle has just begun and has not yet been carried out in depth, in addition to continuing to expose and criticize typical bad people and bad deeds, should also be good at promoting typical good people and good deeds in Party organizations and state organs; and be able to report on a good example in a concrete and in-depth manner, preventing the shortcomings of introducing good people and talking more about the past and less about the present, and talking more about abstract principles and less about concrete examples; at the same time, the examples of good people and good deeds that are commended must be truthful and appropriate, and we must accept the lessons of some newspapers in the past that reported false models, and prevent any untruthfulness and exaggeration. Only when our newspapers conduct an irreconcilable and solemn struggle against bad people and bad deeds, and enthusiastically commend and praise good people and good deeds, can our newspapers fully play their fighting role and educational role. Naturally, the publicity of Dazhong Daily and Liaoxi Daily in this area is not without shortcomings. For example, although Dazhong Daily has more extensively commended good people and good deeds, it has not done enough to grasp typical examples and carry out more concentrated, systematic, and prominent publicity; therefore, many grassroots cadres commended by the newspaper have not been able to fully arouse deep repercussions among the masses. Although Liaoxi Daily has clearly established a banner like Tong Yulan, the combination of typical commendation and general commendation is not enough, which also weakens the effect of publicity, and these should continue to be improved.

### 深入宣传典型的好人好事

专栏：报纸工作述评

    深入宣传典型的好人好事
    各地报纸近几个月来对官僚主义、命令主义和违法乱纪现象所进行的坚决斗争，不仅大大鼓舞了人民群众的政治积极性，而且大大提高了广大干部的政治思想水平，使他们深刻地认识到，这些坏现象是反动统治阶级官僚作风的残余在我们党和人民政府内部的反映，必须坚决地克服这些坏作风，才能够有效地为人民服务。但是怎样树立正确的作风？这对于每一个干部来说，并不是已经完全解决了的问题。恰恰相反，在许多干部特别是基层干部中，相当普遍地存在着“官僚主义和强迫命令不对，群众路线又不会”的苦闷。这就要求我们的报纸在注重揭露一些典型的坏人坏事以后，除了将反官僚主义的斗争密切结合日常工作经常开展以外，还应同时注意表扬典型的好人好事，使全体党员和干部群众向这些好的典型看齐，以发扬正气，压倒邪气。山东大众日报、辽西日报、河北日报、新湖南报、南京新华日报、河南日报等报已注意到这一方面的宣传，其中以山东大众日报和辽西日报做得较有成绩。
    山东大众日报对好人好事的典型进行了适时的、广泛的表扬。在揭发“柏春溪事件”、“赵王堂村事件”、“病员张克敬生蛆致死事件”等典型的坏人坏事之后，随着山东地区反官僚主义斗争的深入开展，该报从四月份开始就配合反官僚主义斗争的继续展开，同时陆续报道了各地能够体现党和人民政府政策的正确的工作作风和工作方法的典型的好人好事。其中以表扬基层干部和基层组织的占多数。例如表扬诸城县万里乡乡长王玉怀、费县十二区区长陈维兰、胶河县桃源乡党总支等等。这是完全必要的。因为广大基层干部和基层组织更加需要从具体生动的范例中学习全心全意为人民服务的观点和群众路线的工作方法。但是大众日报也没有忽视表扬领导机关领导干部中典型的好人好事，特别是和当前中心工作紧密相结合的典型好人好事。例如该报曾在四月八日突出地报道了莒南县委转变一般化领导作风，深入农民群众系统地总结变薄地为肥地的整地经验，和以保苗为中心的改进耕作技术经验，从而找到了进一步增产的关键。该报并为此发表社论，号召各地学习莒南县委的领导方法，
    “立即深入到当前的春耕生产运动中去，亲临农业生产的前线，下决心钻进去，研究和解决生产中的具体问题，集中群众的创造，总结分析群众的经验，抓住当地增产的关键，正确地指导春耕生产运动”。接着在四月十九日、五月八日有关春种和抗旱的社论中，该报又一再提出要将莒南县委等单位的群众路线工作方法加以发扬光大运用到当前的生产领导中去。该报对于广饶县委发现抗碱保地经验、历城县委创造生产救灾好办法等“从群众中来，到群众中去”的模范事例，同样进行了有力的宣传。经过报纸宣传，这些典型的好人好事不仅为很多地区所学习，而且成为推动当前工作的一种力量。正如该报在五月二十六日的社论中总结春季生产时所指出的，今年山东地区春季生产所以进行得好，最重要的原因在于各级领导和干部的工作作风有重大转变，加强了具体领导，采取了群众路线的
    工作方法。
    辽西日报在表扬典型的好人好事方面，宣传得更为集中有力。该报曾在三月二十二日发表了辽西省委和省人民政府严正处理锦西县六区富隆山村村长包海山等坏分子严重违法乱纪案件的消息，其后连续发表了广大读者批判这一事件和拥护党政领导机关严肃处理坏人坏事的来信。四月五日该报又以“正确地吸取‘富隆山事件’的教训”为题发表社论，进一步阐明反官僚主义斗争的政策界限，并批判了部分区村干部在反官僚主义斗争中不敢负责工作、怕受处分等消极思想和情绪。该报在连续地批判了这一典型的坏人坏事后，在四月八日以显著地位报道了北镇县一区李屯村党支部书记、模范村干部佟玉兰关心群众生活和疾苦、以群众路线的工作方法领导群众斗争和生产的范例，并发表了省人民政府奖励李屯村和佟玉兰的决定，同时发表社论，号召区村干部向佟玉兰学习。接着就辟了专栏“学习佟玉兰的正确工作作风和工作方法”，对佟玉兰的模范事迹和区村干部学习佟玉兰的效果进行了连续报道。辽西日报在大力揭发典型的坏人坏事后，又对典型的好人好事进行了强烈的宣传，这就给广大区村干部清楚地划出了好和坏、正确和错误的界限，并为他们具体地指明了努力的方向。因此佟玉兰的模范事迹一经报纸宣扬，很自然地在广大干部中掀起了学习的热潮。辽西日报着重地报道了这一学习的效果，用以推动更多的人参加学习。例如锦县十一区白台子村党支部在接到报纸的当天，就组织党员、村干部等进行学习。支部组织委员、村妇女会主任把刊载佟玉兰事迹的报纸整天装在口袋里，有空就拿出来学习。陈书礼在学习后高兴地说：“这回学习了佟玉兰的工作作风和工作方法，我找到了方向，工作有了信心。”北镇县四区索屯村党支部采取的学习方法是：一边学习，一边检查，一边行动。例如统计委员工作怕困难，就专门学习佟玉兰是怎样战胜困难，做好工作的；民政委员不能开展批评与自我批评，就专门学习佟玉兰是怎样检查缺点，改正缺点的。当时辽西省农业生产正遭遇春旱的威胁，因此佟玉兰领导李屯村群众引水灌溉的群众路线工作方法，就很快成为全省区村干部最实际的学习内容。彰武县三区兴隆山村支部书记蔡兴有、组织委员刘德林学习了佟玉兰的事迹后，就以批评和自我批评精神认真检查了过去支部工作中不走群众路线的缺点，进而发动群众利用河水灌溉，使全村五百多垧地免除了春旱威胁，创造了新的经验，给全省开展群众性小型水利树立了新的榜样。类似这种学习佟玉兰的工作方法推动了抗旱工作的例子，辽西日报作了很多及时的报道。
    大众日报和辽西日报关于典型的好人好事的宣传，证明了活生生的榜样具有最大的说服力量；只要报纸善于抓住这种榜样进行有力的宣传，就可能产生最广泛的社会影响。在开展反对坏人坏事的斗争到达一定阶段的时候，报纸及时地运用好人好事的榜样来教育广大干部，将极大地帮助他们切实有效地克服官僚主义和命令主义。因此我们的报纸，特别是那些反官僚主义斗争刚刚开始和尚未深入开展的地区的报纸，除应该对典型的坏人坏事继续揭发和批判以外，还应该善于发扬党组织和国家机关中典型的好人好事；并能以一个好典型，作具体而深刻的报道，防止介绍好人谈过去多谈现在少，谈抽象原则多谈具体事例少的毛病；同时，对于所表扬的好人好事的典型，还必须做到真实和恰当，要接受过去某些报纸报道假模范的教训，防止任何的不真实和夸大。只有当我们的报纸对坏人坏事进行不调和的严正的斗争，而又对好人好事进行满腔热情的表扬和歌颂，我们的报纸才能够全面地发挥它的战斗作用和教育作用。自然，大众日报和辽西日报在这方面的宣传也不是没有缺点的。例如大众日报虽曾较为广泛地表扬了好人好事，但紧紧抓住典型进行更为集中、系统、突出的宣传还做得不够；因而该报所表扬的许多基层干部，在群众中还不能充分地引起深刻的反响。辽西日报虽则鲜明地树立了佟玉兰这样的旗帜，但典型的表扬和一般的表扬结合得不够，同样削弱了宣传的效果，这些都应该继续加以改进。
