    Xinhua News Agency, Copenhagen, June 9th: According to TASS, at the World Women's Congress on the 7th, Mrs. Gordon, President of the Women's International Democratic Federation, gave a report on the second item on the agenda. In her report, she pointed out that, in addition to fighting for their own rights, women all over the world are also facing another extremely important task: to strive to maintain peace and defend children. The importance of the struggle of women today, together with everyone, to strive to maintain international peace and to strive for peaceful solutions to all international problems, far exceeds all women's movements in history. Women have become a vast, active, and practical force in the people's movement for peace in various countries. Women of all social classes and all political and religious beliefs participate in this movement.

    Mrs. Gordon cited specific examples to vividly illustrate how women in various countries are fighting to win peace, oppose the current war, especially the Korean War, and how they are striving to conclude a Five-Power Peace Pact and demanding a ban on weapons of mass destruction.

    She said that in Latin American countries, the struggle against the Korean War has developed to an unprecedented scale. In Argentina, a wave of demonstrations against the Korean War has swept the country. In Cuba, more than 300 mothers' committees against sending troops to Korea have been established throughout the country. In Brazil, the people's movement against sending soldiers to Korea was first launched by women. Due to the strong protest movement of the people, Latin American countries, with the exception of Colombia, have not sent soldiers to Korea.

    In some other countries, there have also been movements of mothers protesting against sending their children to fight in Korea. In Smyrna, Turkey, when a troop transport ship was about to set sail for Korea, a large group of women gathered and shouted: "Give us back our children!" In the United Kingdom, the movement to achieve a ceasefire in Korea has almost reached a national scale. In the United States, in addition to groups such as the "American Women for Peace Committee," many new groups and organizations are now being established across the country. Among them, the "Three Mothers Group" established in Washington State collected 30,000 signatures for a declaration demanding a ceasefire in Korea, and Illinois first launched a "Save Our Sons" movement. The "Parents Alliance of Soldiers Fighting in Korea" currently has branches in many states across the country.

    In Italy, the Italian Women's League is conducting an extensive campaign to achieve a ceasefire in Korea. Italian women sent a total of 43,000 postcards to the American Embassy in Rome, demanding an end to the Korean War. French women oppose all current wars, mainly demanding an end to the war against the Vietnamese people, demanding the recall of French troops, and demanding negotiations with the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

    Mrs. Gordon then spoke about the participation of women in colonies and dependent countries in national liberation movements. She said: The example of Chinese women has inspired women in Asian and African countries who are fighting for national independence.

    In her report, Mrs. Gordon spoke about the active participation of women in the Soviet Union, China, and other people's democratic countries in the movement to defend peace, and the great achievements they have made in the labor of peaceful construction. She also spoke about the activities of the Women's International Democratic Federation in protecting children, and analyzed the great development of the international women's movement.

    Mrs. Gordon pointed out that unity is the most important condition in the struggle for women's rights, for the safety of children, and for the establishment of peace. She cited many examples to illustrate that women in different countries are becoming more and more aligned on various issues.

    Mrs. Gordon said: Never before has there been such a great possibility of establishing peace as there is now. Recently, the Soviet Union, China, and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea have taken certain steps aimed at resolving intractable international issues. The powerful movement of people in various countries to defend peace has forced the leaders of the United States and the United Kingdom to issue statements that can be considered by the people of all countries to be meaningful in resolving international problems through peaceful means. We will welcome and agree to any steps aimed at resolving international disputes, easing the threat of war, stopping the arms race, and improving the living conditions of the people. At the same time, we must never forget that there is still a force hindering the peaceful resolution of international disputes, continuing to prepare for new wars, and opposing a ceasefire in Korea.

    When talking about the tasks facing the international women's movement, Mrs. Gordon said: Women must fight to stop the Korean War, and must firmly advocate that the Four Great Powers hold negotiations in the spirit of respecting the Potsdam Agreement to resolve the German issue. She said: The task of all women is to strive for the conclusion of a peace pact, to strive for the prohibition of atomic weapons, bacteriological weapons and other weapons of mass destruction. Another main task of women's struggle is to strive for the national independence of their countries. Women must work to ensure that their governments defend their country's national sovereignty and respect the national interests of other peoples.

    Mrs. Gordon concluded by saying: Peace can be consolidated as long as the people of all countries establish friendly cooperation in economic and cultural life. We women must strive to promote cooperation and friendship among the people of all countries living under different systems.

    戈登夫人报告摘要
    【新华社九日讯】据塔斯社哥本哈根八日讯：在世界妇女大会七日会议上，国际民主妇女联合会主席戈登夫人就第二项议程作了报告。她在报告中指出，全世界妇女除了为争取自身的权利而斗争外，还面临着另一极端重大的任务：争取保持和平，保卫儿童。妇女今天和大家一道，共同争取保持国际和平并争取和平解决一切国际问题，这种斗争的重要性远超过历史上一切的妇女运动。妇女已在各国人民争取和平的运动中成了一支浩大、积极和实际的力量。一切社会阶层和一切政治及宗教信仰的妇女都参加了这个运动。
    戈登夫人引证具体的事例，生动地说明了各国妇女怎样进行斗争，以争取和平，反对目前正在进行的战争，特别是反对朝鲜战争，以及她们怎样在争取缔结五大国和平公约，要求禁止大规模杀人武器。
    她说，在拉丁美洲各国，反对朝鲜战争的斗争发展到空前巨大的规模。在阿根廷，反对朝鲜战争的示威的浪潮已席卷全国。在古巴，全国成立了三百多个反对派遣军队到朝鲜去的母亲委员会。在巴西，反对派遣士兵前往朝鲜的人民运动是妇女最先发动的。由于人民这种强大的抗议运动，拉丁美洲国家，除了哥伦比亚之外，都没有派士兵到朝鲜去。
    在其他一些国家里，也发生母亲抗议把她们的孩子送到朝鲜去作战的运动。在土耳其的士麦那港，当一艘运兵船起锚开往朝鲜的时候，大批妇女聚集起来，高呼：“把我们的孩子还给我们！”在英国，争取朝鲜停战的运动已经近乎全国的规模。在美国，除了“美国妇女争取和平委员会”等团体之外，现在全国各地正在成立许多新的团体和组织。其中，华盛顿州成立的“三母亲团”为要求朝鲜停战的宣言征集了三万人的签名，伊利诺斯州最先发起了一个“拯救我们的儿子”运动。“在朝鲜作战军人父母联盟”，目前已在全国许多州有了分支组织。
    在意大利，意大利妇女联盟进行了一个广泛的争取朝鲜停战的运动。意大利妇女共寄出四万三千张明信片给罗马美国大使馆，要求停止朝鲜战争。法国妇女反对目前进行中的一切战争，主要是要求停止对越南人民的战争，要求召回法国军队，并要求与越南民主共和国政府举行谈判。
    戈登夫人继而谈到殖民地和附属国妇女参加民族解放运动的情况。她说：中国妇女的范例鼓舞了亚洲和非洲国家中正在为民族独立而斗争的妇女。
    戈登夫人在报告中谈到了苏联、中国和其他人民民主国家妇女积极参加保卫和平运动，在和平建设的劳动中创造巨大成就的情况。她还谈到国际民主妇女联合会在保卫儿童方面的活动，并分析了国际妇女运动的巨大发展。
    戈登夫人指出，在争取妇女权利、争取儿童安全、争取建立和平的斗争中，团结是最重要的条件。她举出许多例子，说明不同国家的妇女在种种问题上意见越来越一致。
    戈登夫人说：从来也没有像现在这样有这么大的建立和平的可能性。最近，苏联、中国、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国采取了某些旨在解决争执不下的国际问题的步骤。各国人民保卫和平的强大运动迫使美国和英国的领袖发表了能被各国人民认为是有意思以和平方法解决国际问题的声明。我们将欢迎并同意任何旨在解决国际争端、缓和战争威胁、停止扩充军备运动、改善人民生活情况的步骤。同时我们决不应该忘记，仍然还有一种势力在阻挠和平解决国际争端，在继续准备新战争，并反对在朝鲜停战。
    戈登夫人谈到国际妇女运动所面临的任务时说：妇女们必须为争取停止朝鲜战争而斗争，必须坚决主张四大国本着尊重波茨坦协定的精神举行谈判，来解决德国问题。她说：全体妇女的任务便是为争取缔结和平公约、争取禁止原子武器、细菌武器和其他大规模杀人武器而奋斗。妇女斗争的另一主要任务便是争取她们国家的民族独立，妇女必须努力使她们的政府保卫本国的国家主权，并且尊重其他人民的民族利益。
    戈登夫人最后说：只要各国人民在经济和文化生活方面建立友好合作，和平就能巩固。我们妇女必须努力使生活在不同制度下的各国人民合作与友好。
