On the Economic Construction Front of the Motherland

    **Early Fulfillment of the First Half-Year State Plan**

    The Northeast Machinery Plant No. 12 victoriously completed the first half-year state plan on the 14th of this month, sixteen days ahead of schedule.

    To welcome "July 1st," the workers of the Northeast Machinery Plant No. 12 launched a "percentage" competition between different work types and departments on the basis of the "Red May" competition. During this competition, they focused on key issues and promoted the advanced experience of the Soviet "stage division of labor system" throughout the factory. In the molten iron furnace area, they promoted the advanced experiences of process cards, the three-row air vent suggested by Soviet experts, and the gate air vent developed by the workers themselves. In the four-column group, they promoted the standard casting sprue experience. In the planing team, they implemented labor division specialization, which greatly improved production efficiency.

    At the same time, the factory promoted the advanced experience of organizing rhythmic production according to indicator charts, completing production plans on a daily, ten-day, and monthly basis, so that the finished product equilibrium rate remained above 95 percent and the process equilibrium rate reached over 85 percent.

    The workers of the Northeast Machinery Plant No. 12 are now continuing their efforts to exceed the first half-year state plan by 10.69 percent by the end of June, as a gift to the Party's birthday. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

    The state-owned Tianjin Bicycle Factory has completed its production plan for the first half of this year twelve days ahead of schedule. The output of Flying Pigeon bicycles exceeded the national production plan by 0.533 percent.

    In the process of discussing and implementing the production plan in the first half of this year, the Tianjin Bicycle Factory continuously discovered weak links and overcame them. In the second quarter, the bicycle factory also signed a collective contract and further improved the operation plan and production scheduling system, ensuring the reliable completion of the production plan. By the first half of June, the forty-four measures to improve production and eleven measures to improve living welfare stipulated in the collective contract had been realized, which greatly improved production. A few work sections and production teams have been able to complete their production plans on a ten-day basis. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

    **"May 3rd Comprehensive Kiln Firing Method" Successfully Tested**

    The "May 3rd Comprehensive Kiln Firing Method" has been successfully tested at the Anshan City Kiln Industry Company. The output of red bricks per kiln has increased by 83.7 percent compared to the past, and the quality of first-class red bricks has also increased by 1.11 percent compared to the past. The Anshan City Kiln Industry Company can now fully supply Anshan's current large demand for red bricks using existing equipment. This not only saves the large investment originally planned for building 30 percent new kilns, but also increases the nation's wealth by 45 billion yuan annually.

    The "May 3rd Comprehensive Kiln Firing Method" was successfully summarized by the Northeast Administrative Committee Local Industry Bureau in March this year based on the Soviet Duvanov "fast firing method" and the advanced experience accumulated by the kiln industry companies in Shenyang, Changchun, Liaoyang, Anshan and other cities over the years. Its main features are: when loading the kiln, the past dense loading is changed to sparse loading; when firing the kiln, firing is carried out according to the different temperatures of the kiln, and coal is added at regular intervals and in fixed quantities, so that the progress of the fire is kept uniform and rapid, avoiding a large number of defective products caused by uneven fire intensity. In addition, in the past, the curved parts at both ends of the kiln were not filled with brick blanks because the bricks were not fired well. Now, the loading method of dense inside and sparse outside is adopted, so that the amount of fire received by the curved parts of the kiln and the plane parts of the kiln is equal, and the curved parts of the kiln can also fire bricks, and the quality is the same as that fired in the plane parts, which greatly improves the volume utilization rate of the kiln.

    During this experiment, representatives from six provinces including Songjiang, Jilin, and Rehe, and cities including Shenyang, Fushun, and Benxi participated. They are preparing to promote this experience in their local areas. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

    **Yunnan Tin Industry Company Vigorously Carries Out Capital Construction**

    The state-owned Yunnan Tin Industry Company is vigorously carrying out capital construction. The state's investment in the capital construction of the Yunnan Tin Industry Company this year exceeds the total investment made by the state in the past three years. The company's capital construction tasks this year include a 16-kilometer-long aerial ropeway, a new-type concentrator, a thermal power plant, and more than 40,000 square meters of newly built factory buildings, employee dormitories, and hospitals. The aerial ropeway, concentrator, and thermal power plant all have preliminary mechanized and automated equipment. Drainage equipment is installed in the concentrator's factory building to keep the factory building dry, and the concentrator workers will no longer be working in water every day. The thermal power plant has automatic coal loading equipment and controllers, as well as steam condensation equipment, which allows all the distilled water to be recycled. With these new-style equipment, production efficiency will be greatly improved. The concentrating capacity of the newly built concentrator is three times that of the Gejiu concentrator, but the number of workers can be reduced by two-thirds.

    The above projects are being actively constructed. The construction site is filled with a tense atmosphere. Trucks carrying various steel materials, cement, timber, and machines, and hundreds of oxcarts and mules are busy carrying bricks and stones. On April 27, the newly built thermal power plant began to supply electricity. (Our reporter station in Chongqing)

    **People in Northwest China Actively Report Mineral Deposits**

    People in Northwest China are actively reporting the mineral outcrops they have discovered to relevant departments. The Northwest Geological Bureau has received more than 40 letters from the public reporting mineral deposits from January to the present. In the Gansu area, nearly 30 letters reporting mineral deposits have been received from September last year to May this year. The types of mineral samples include iron, manganese, gold, silver, lead, petroleum, coal, asphalt, mica, copper, and many others. These mineral outcrops are spread throughout the five provinces of Northwest China.

    According to the results of preliminary chemical analysis of these mineral outcrops, some of them are very important minerals, and the mineral composition content is very high. Some minerals contain 82.48 percent lead, some minerals contain 48.53 percent manganese, and some minerals contain 64.69 percent iron. These minerals are of great importance to our country's economic construction.

    In order to further organize and lead the masses to do a good job in reporting mineral deposits, the Northwest Geological Bureau has established a "Public Mineral Deposit Reporting Section," formulated measures to reward the public for reporting mineral deposits, and dispatched outcrop teams at any time to conduct mobile geological reconnaissance based on the clues reported by the public.

    **Shenyang Machine Workers Have a Comfortable Sanatorium**

    On the east side of Yunfeng Street in Tiexi District, Shenyang, there is a very beautiful two-story building. The building is surrounded by flowers and trees planted in rows in the courtyard. This is the sanatorium for machine workers in Shenyang City. In the increase production and practice economy movement in 1951, the machine workers in Shenyang City created wealth worth 860,000 tons of grain for the country, and in the first half of 1952, they created wealth worth 630,000 tons of grain for the country. On the basis of developing production, the Party and the People's Government took care of the needs of the machine workers and decided to build this sanatorium.

    The sanatorium has a total of 200 beds, with X-ray rooms, laboratory, injection room, pharmacy, etc. There is also a club where convalescents go every day to listen to the radio, sing songs, play table tennis, and engage in various cultural and recreational activities.

    Four groups of convalescents have already recovered and been discharged from the hospital. They have played a more active role in their production posts. For example, after returning to the factory, veteran worker Ma Wanzhong found two tricks to improve a certain product, which often had 30 percent defective products, to consistently produce 100 percent excellent products.

    在祖国经济建设的战线上
    提前完成上半年国家计划
    东北机械十二厂在本月十四日提前十六天胜利完成了上半年国家计划。
    东北机械十二厂的职工们为了迎接“七一”，在“红五月”竞赛的基础上展开了同工种之间和科室之间的“百分”竞赛。在这次竞赛中，他们围绕着关键问题，在全厂推广了苏联“阶段分工制”的先进经验，在化铁炉方面推广了工艺卡片、苏联专家建议的三排风眼和职工们研究出来的闸门风眼等先进经验，在四柱组推广了标准浇铸水口经验，在刨工班实行了劳动分工专业化，使生产效率大大提高。
    同时，在竞赛中全厂推广了按指示图表组织有节奏生产的先进经验，做到按日按旬按月地完成生产计划，使成品均衡率始终保持在百分之九十五以上，工序均衡率达到百分之八十五以上。
    东北机械十二厂职工现在正继续努力，争取到六月末超过上半年国家计划百分之十点六九，做为给党的生日的献礼。（据新华社讯）
    国营天津自行车厂已提前十二天完成今年上半年的生产计划。飞鸽牌自行车的产量超过国家生产计划的百分之零点五三三。
    天津自行车厂今年上半年在讨论和执行生产计划的过程中，不断发现薄弱环节并加以克服。第二季度内，自行车厂还签订了集体合同，并进一步健全了作业计划和生产调度制度，使生产计划的完成得到可靠保证。到六月上半月，集体合同规定的四十四项改进生产和十一项改进生活福利的措施已经实现，使生产得到很大提高。少数工部和生产班已能做到按旬完成生产计划。（据新华社讯）
    “五三综合烧窑法”试验成功
    “五三综合烧窑法”，已在鞍山市窑业公司试验成功。每窑红砖产量比过去提高了百分之八十三点七，质量方面一级红砖也比过去提高了百分之一点一一。鞍山市窑业公司现在只要利用现有的设备就可以充分供应鞍山市目前对红砖的大量需要。这样，不但节省了原来准备增建百分之三十新窑的大量投资，而且每年还可以为国家增产四百五十亿元的财富。
    “五三综合烧窑法”，是东北行政委员会地方工业局在今年三月根据苏联杜瓦诺夫“快速烧火法”，和沈阳、长春、辽阳、鞍山等市窑业公司历年所积累的先进经验总结成功的。它的主要特点是：装窑时，把过去的密装改为稀装；烧窑时，根据窑的各种不同的温度进行烧火，定时定量的添煤，使火的进度保持均匀、迅速，避免因火力强弱不均而造成的大量废品。另外，过去窑的两头弯处因烧不好砖而不装砖坯，现在采用了里密外稀的装法，使窑的弯处和窑的平面处得到的火量均等，窑的弯处也能烧砖，质量和平面处烧的一样，大大提高了窑的容积利用率。
    这次试验时，松江、吉林、热河等六省和沈阳、抚顺、本溪等市都派代表参加，他们准备回本地推广这一经验。（据新华社讯）
    云南锡业公司大力进行基本建设
    国营云南锡业公司正大力进行基本建设。今年国家对云南锡业公司基本建设的投资，超过过去三年来国家投资的总和。该公司今年的基本建设任务，包括有长达十六公里的架空索道、新型选矿厂、火力发电厂和新盖的四万多平方公尺的厂房、职工宿舍、医院等。架空索道、选矿厂和火力发电厂都有初步的机械化、自动化设备。在选矿厂的厂房里安装有排水设备，能使厂房内保持干燥，选矿工人们将不再天天踏在水里工作了。火力发电厂有自动上煤设备和控制器，还有蒸气凝结设备，这可以使全部经过蒸溜的水巡回应用。由于有这些新式的设备，生产效率将大大提高。新建的选矿厂的选矿量为个旧选矿厂的三倍，工人却可以减少三分之二。
    以上各种工程，正在积极进行建筑中。工地上充满了紧张的气氛。载运各种钢料、水泥、木材、机器的卡车和数以百计的牛车、骡马忙碌地驮运着砖、石。四月二十七日，新建的火力发电厂已开始送电。（本报重庆记者站）
    西北各地人民积极报矿
    西北各地人民，积极地把他们所发现的矿苗，报告给有关部门。西北地质局从今年一月到现在，共收到了群众报矿信四十多封。甘肃地区，从去年九月到今年五月，收到了报矿信将近三十件。矿样种类有铁、锰、金、银、铅、石油、煤、沥青、云母、铜等多种。这些矿苗遍及西北五省。
    这些矿苗经初步化验的结果来看，其中有些是很重要的矿产，并且矿质成份含量很高。有的矿含铅占百分之八十二点四八，有的矿含锰占百分之四十八点五三，有的矿含铁占百分之六十四点六九。这些矿产对于我们国家的经济建设作用很大。
    西北地质局为进一步组织领导群众做好报矿工作，已成立了“群众报矿科”，制订了群众报矿奖励办法，并随时派遣露头队，根据群众报矿线索进行机动的地质预察。
    沈阳机器工人有了舒适的疗养院
    在沈阳铁西区云峰街路东，有一座很美丽的两层楼房。楼房四周和院内，种着花草和成行的树木。这就是沈阳市机器工人的疗养院。沈阳市的机器工人，在一九五一年增产节约运动中，给国家创造了价值八十六万吨粮食的财富，一九五二年上半年又给国家创造了价值六十三万吨粮食的财富。在发展生产的基础上，党和人民政府照顾机器工人的需要，决定修建了这个疗养院。
    疗养院一共有二百个床位，有X光室、化验室、注射室、药局等。另外还有俱乐部，疗养员每天到那里听广播、唱歌、打乒乓球，作各种文化娱乐活动。
    这里已有四期疗养员恢复健康出了院。他们在生产岗位上，更加发挥了积极性。如老工人马万忠回厂不久，找了两个窍门，使经常有百分之三十废品的某种产品，提高到经常出百分之百的优良品。
