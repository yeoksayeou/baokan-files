Achievements in Cultural Learning by the People's Liberation Army Constructing the Kangzang Highway

The People's Liberation Army Tibet Military Region troops stationed along the Kangzang Highway have persisted in cultural learning during highway construction and transportation work, and have achieved great results. Illiteracy has now been eliminated throughout the army, and 40% of the soldiers have reached the level of elementary school. Generally, they can read popular newspapers and periodicals, and some can even read Chairman Mao's works. On the construction sites, the construction troops persist in four to four and a half hours of cultural learning per week. To consolidate their learning results, soldiers often use stones as blackboards during rest periods to practice writing characters and sentences. The transportation troops, taking into account the characteristics of their scattered and mobile work, have launched a red flag competition, still ensuring three hours of study time per week. Many learning models have emerged in the learning process. One unit of the construction troops, for example, has one-third of its members selected as learning models.

A New Method for Learning Tibetan Developed by the National Language Class of the National School of the Tibetan Autonomous Region of Xikang Province

Han students in the National Language Class of the National School of the Tibetan Autonomous Region of Xikang Province have creatively developed a new method for learning Tibetan, which has accelerated the learning progress. The students in the National Language Class have only formally studied Tibetan for two months and have already learned Tibetan phonetics and more than 700 new words, and can write notes in Tibetan. In addition to adopting the crash course phonetics method used by the Tibetan class of the Central Institute for Nationalities, they have developed a new learning method, that is, according to the characteristics of many Tibetan homophones, homographs, and synonyms, they memorize new words in groups and in a circular manner. When memorizing new words, they often connect with the text and recall the meaning of the text while reading. At the same time, they have also organized learning mutual aid groups to help each other learn. This new method of learning Tibetan has been valued by the Kangding Local Committee of the Communist Party of China, which is preparing to continue to enrich and improve it in order to create a more complete crash course Tibetan learning method.

Gansu and Xinjiang Send Film Teams to Minority Areas to Show Movies

Gansu Province and Xinjiang Province have recently sent many film work teams to various minority areas to show movies and slides.

Gansu Province has sent more than 30 film teams, carrying films such as "Great Unity of Chinese Nationalities," "March into Tibet," "Victory of the People of Inner Mongolia," and "Happy Xinjiang," to the areas inhabited by the Zuni, Xiahe, and Xihai Gu minorities and areas inhabited by mixed ethnic groups.

The three pastoral film education work teams sent by Xinjiang Province, carrying films with Uyghur, Kazakh, and other ethnic language explanations such as "Liberated China," "Great Unity of Chinese Nationalities," "Happy Xinjiang," "Long Live Peace," "South and North Wars," and the Soviet Union's "Kazakhstan" as well as slides on the development of animal husbandry production, went to the Ashan and Tacheng regions in northern Xinjiang to show them. The staff of these three film education work teams are all cadres of various ethnic groups such as Uyghur and Kazakh, who have just graduated from the Xinjiang Provincial Film Training Class.

The various film teams were warmly welcomed by the herdsmen after arriving in the pastoral areas of the two provinces. Tibetan herdsmen in southern Gansu rode horses and fired guns on the grassland to welcome them. When the herdsmen saw Chairman Mao appearing on the screen, they waved their hats and cheered or rode around the field once to express their infinite respect for Chairman Mao.

    修筑康藏公路的解放军学习文化有成绩
    驻康藏公路沿线的中国人民解放军西藏军区部队，在修筑公路和运输工作中，坚持文化学习，已有很大成绩。现在全军已经消灭了文盲，有百分之四十的人达到了初小程度，一般都能阅读通俗报刊，有的还能读毛主席的著作。筑路部队在工地上，每周坚持四小时到四个半小时的文化学习，为了巩固学习成果，战士们在休息时间，还常常把石头当黑板，练习写字和写话。运输部队针对分散和流动的工作特点，展开红旗竞赛，每周仍保证三小时的学习时间。在学习中，各部涌现了许多学习模范，筑路部队某部就有三分之一的人当选了学习模范。
    西康省藏族自治区民族学校语文班研究出一种学习藏文的新方法
    西康省藏族自治区民族学校民族语文班的汉族学员，创造性地研究出了一种学习藏文的新方法，使学习进度加快。民族语文班的学员正式学习藏文才两个月，已经学会了藏文拼音和七百多个生字，并且能够用藏文写便条。学员们在学习中，除了采用中央民族学院藏文班所使用的速成拼音法外，他们研究出一种新的学习方法，即按照藏文同音、同形、同义字多的特点，分组记忆、循环记忆生字，记生字时要常联系课文和边读课文边回忆课文意义。同时，他们还组织了学习互助组，互助学习。这种学习藏文的新方法，已为中共康定地方委员会重视，准备继续充实提高，以创造一种较完整的藏文速成学习方法。

    各个电影队到达两省少数民族的牧区后，受到牧民的热烈欢迎。甘肃南部的藏族牧民在草原上骑马鸣枪赶来欢迎。牧民们看到毛主席在银幕上出现时，他们都挥帽欢呼或骑马绕场一周，表示对毛主席的无限尊敬。
