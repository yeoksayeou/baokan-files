Jilin Province has carried out a series of preparatory work to implement the "Instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on the Theoretical Education of Cadres in 1953-1954."

The Jilin Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and Party committees at all levels have conscientiously implemented the central instructions. The Provincial Committee has held meetings to discuss the central instructions and conveyed the content of the Northeast Regional Theoretical Education Symposium. Thirty-five part-time teachers for the intermediate group and thirty-four teachers for the primary group have now been designated for the directly affiliated organs of the province. It has also been decided to hold a one-year training class for full-time teachers of the primary group. The Party Committee of the directly affiliated organs of the province also convened a meeting of general branch secretaries and activists to mobilize everyone to meet the new high tide of learning and discuss how to implement the new study plan. The general branch secretaries and administrative leaders of various organs also conducted in-depth mobilization and made ideological preparations for the implementation of the new study plan.

The amateur political school of the directly affiliated organs of the province. In order to eliminate the shortcomings of large classes being inconvenient for linking with reality and having too many people, three branch schools have been established for the health, commerce, and forestry systems.

To prepare guiding forces, the Propaganda Department of the Provincial Party Committee has held two training classes for part-time theoretical teachers and instructors of the primary group who are off-duty. The first phase ended on April 9th, with the participation of 174 teachers from organs directly under the county and factories and mines within the county, as well as study instructors from organs directly under the province, city, and county. The second phase also ended on June 5th. Eighty-eight part-time theoretical teachers and instructors from organs in county towns and some factories and mines were trained. The training class mainly studied the first four chapters of the "Reader on Common Knowledge of Economic Construction" (the remaining chapters will be studied in phases later) and studied teaching methods in order to undertake the task of lecturing or tutoring on the primary group courses in various counties. In addition, a study and research meeting for intermediate group instructors will be held from June 10th to the end of June to study the content and key points of tutoring for Chapters 9 to 12 of the "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)."

According to the instructions of the Central Committee, all localities have reorganized the study organizations and prepared guiding forces in accordance with the conditions for grouping. At present, 433 people in the province are participating in advanced group studies, 6,458 are participating in intermediate group studies, and 35,311 are participating in primary group studies (some factories and mines are not included). There are a total of 101 intermediate group teachers (all part-time), 368 primary group teachers (2 full-time, the rest part-time), 102 intermediate group instructors, and 527 primary group instructors (all instructors are part-time, Jilin and Changchun cities are not included).

The instructions of the Central Committee have become a huge force for promoting the theoretical study of cadres throughout the province. The blackboards in some organs have become active, publishing many cadres' determination to study. Many comrades from the Jilin Provincial Committee of the Communist Youth League and the Jilin Provincial Taxation Bureau have formulated personal study plans and are actively preparing to meet the new study tasks. The cadre amateur political school of the directly affiliated organs of the province purchased 1,080 copies of the "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)" for the students, and subscribed to 1,580 copies of the book "On Socialist Economic Construction in the Soviet Union" for the intermediate group.

At present, the primary groups in various counties and directly affiliated organs of the province have started classes, and the intermediate groups are reviewing the "History of the Communist Party of China," which will end on June 15th, and then they will preview the "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)." The advanced group began studying Chapters 7 and 8 of the "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)" in late May. In order to enable the advanced group to study this course well and earnestly guide the study of cadres below, a plenary meeting of the advanced group was convened on May 30th, and Comrade Fu Zhensheng, Deputy Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, made a mobilization. The theoretical study of cadres throughout the province is entering a new high tide of learning.

    吉林省积极准备执行新的学习计划
    为了贯彻中共中央“关于一九五三—一九五四年干部理论教育的指示”，吉林省已进行了一系列的准备工作。
    中共吉林省委和各级党委都认真贯彻中央指示。省委已召开会议，讨论中央指示，并传达了东北区理论教育座谈会议的内容。现已指定了省直属机关的中级组兼职教员三十五名，初级组教员三十四名。且确定举办初级组的专职教员一年制培训班。省直属机关党委亦召开了总支书记和学习活动分子会议，动员大家迎接新的学习高潮，讨论如何执行新的学习计划。各机关总支和行政负责同志亦进行深入动员，对执行新的学习计划做了思想准备。
    省直属机关业余政治学校。为消除上大课不便于联系实际而且人数过多的缺点，又成立了卫生、商业、林业等三个系统的分校。
    为准备指导力量，省委宣传部已举办了两期离职的初级组兼职理论教员、辅导员训练班。第一期在四月九日即已结束，参加学习的有县直属机关及各县境内厂矿的教员和省、市、县直属机关学习辅导员一百七十四人。第二期也于六月五日结束。受训的是各县城镇区机关及部分厂矿的兼职理论教员和辅导员共八十八人。训练班主要是学习“经济建设常识读本”的前四章（其余各章以后再分期学习），并研究教学方法，以便担任各县初级组课程的讲授或辅导任务。另外，将于六月十日至六月底举办中级组辅导员业余学习研究会，研究“联共（布）党史”第九章至十二章的内容和辅导要点。
    根据中央的指示，各地已都按照编组条件，整顿了学习组织，准备了指导力量。现在全省参加高级组学习的有四百三十三人，参加中级组的有六千四百五十八人，参加初级组的有三万五千三百十一人
    （有一部分厂矿未计入）。共有中级组教员一百零一人（全部兼职），初级组教员三百六十八人（专职二人，余均兼职），中级组辅导员一百零二人，初级组辅导员五百二十七人（辅导员均系兼职，吉林、长春两市均未计入）。
    中央的指示成了推动全省干部理论学习的巨大力量。有些机关的黑板报都活跃起来了，刊登着许多干部的学习决心。青年团吉林省委、吉林省税务局的很多同志都订了个人学习计划，积极准备迎接新的学习任务。省直属机关的干部业余政治学校给学员代买的“联共（布）党史”就有一千零八十本，代订中级组用的“论苏联社会主义经济建设”一书有
    一千五百八十本。
    目前，各县和省直属机关初级组已开课，中级组正复习“中共党史”，六月十五日结束后即将预习
    “联共（布）党史”。高级组已于五月下旬开始学习“联共（布）党史”第七、八两章。为了使高级组学好这门课程并认真指导下面干部的学习，于五月三十日召集了高级组全体会议，省委副书记富振声同志又作了动员。全省干部理论学习正进入一个新的学习高潮。
