    Northeast's First Phase of Construction Projects Fully Underway
    All Units Universally Launch Responsibility System Campaign

    [Report from this newspaper] The first phase of capital construction projects in the Northeast region this year has generally commenced, and all construction units are vigorously launching a responsibility system campaign. To date, the total construction area started in the region has reached 2.63 million square meters. These projects include over 300,000 square meters of important factory buildings and major civil engineering projects such as the Harbin Medical University, Shenyang Agricultural College, and the Changchun Comprehensive Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. In Anshan, civil engineering projects that have commenced account for more than 60% of the annual plan; in Shenyang, they account for 36%, and in Harbin, 32%.

    This year, the Anshan Iron and Steel Company's large rolling mill and seamless steel tube plant, Mechanical Factory No. 7, the electromechanical installation projects of the power system, and the seven and a half pairs of vertical shafts under continued construction in the coal mining system have all started on schedule, with rapid progress. The Anshan Iron and Steel Company's large rolling mill has already completed 51.2% of its annual mechanical installation plan; the mechanical installation work of the seamless steel tube plant has been basically completed, except for electrical installation. The power system has successfully completed the installation of two giant generators and has begun the installation of new giant generators. Mechanical Factory No. 7 has also completed 39% of its annual planned number of installations. The seven and a half pairs of vertical shafts under continued construction in the coal mines had completed 48.5% of the annual planned workload by the end of April; the construction of two open-pit mines had completed 68.5% of the annual stripping volume by May 15, with the Fuxin Haizhou open-pit mine expected to start production in early July. For the newly built and renovated twenty-one inclined shaft projects, the tunneling completed 37.7% of the annual plan by May 15, and the masonry completed 36.5% of the annual plan.

    In terms of resource exploration, hundreds of drilling rigs are currently conducting drilling projects for ferrous metals, non-ferrous metals, and coal mines in twelve key mining areas. Geological prospecting and detailed surveys in key areas have also begun. In urban construction projects, the construction of water and sewage systems, water sources, gas pipelines, important railways, and bridges in cities such as Shenyang, Anshan, Harbin, Changchun, and Dalian has largely commenced. The construction of a 99.5-kilometer-long forest railway and a newly built 275-kilometer-long highway has also begun.

    The progress of the projects that have commenced varies due to differences in the quality of preparatory work, the strength of leadership, and other related conditions. Generally, they can be divided into the following three categories: The first category includes projects with better start-up conditions, such as the large rolling mill, seamless steel tube plant, and thin plate plant construction sites of Anshan Iron and Steel Company, a certain generator installation site, the Fuxin Haizhou open-pit mine, Construction Site 105, and the large motor workshop construction site of Electric Factory No. 4. These projects are characterized by: 1. The preparation of a relatively complete construction organization design before construction, ensuring the planned supply of materials, prefabricated components, tools, and water and electricity. 2. Determining the project progress and construction operation plan based on average advanced quotas and reasonable construction methods, and after discussion by the workers, making specific regulations according to the different situations of different types of work and shifts/groups. On this basis, establishing contact contracts between construction personnel and work sections, between work sections, and between work sections and groups to ensure mutual compliance with the project instruction charts. 3. Setting technical quality standards for each part and item of the project, along with operating procedures, and educating workers through oral instruction and model exhibitions so that they can accept and apply them, and establishing independent quality inspection organizations and mass quality inspection systems for both parties (甲乙). 4. Both parties (甲乙) have the spirit of actively completing the national construction plan, cooperating with each other, taking the initiative to overcome difficulties, and dividing labor to solve problems. Some have even established joint offices or held bi-daily meetings to exchange opinions and promote work in a timely manner.

    The second category has general technical and material preparations, but they are not thorough enough; the preparation of organizational work is also insufficient, so the construction organization design and construction operation plan are not completely practical, and the technical quality standards and technical operating procedures are not complete, especially the failure to seriously mobilize workers to discuss and implement them; construction management is generally generalized, so at the beginning of construction, there are more or less problems in the quality of basic engineering, labor organization, and employee life support. However, because both parties (甲乙) can actively and proactively negotiate to solve problems and are strengthening leadership over the construction site, the situation is improving through mobilizing employees to establish a responsibility system. This type of unit accounts for a relatively large proportion of the units that have started construction.

    The third category is characterized by relatively chaotic construction conditions, slow construction progress, frequent quality accidents, and significant waste. For example, the construction site of Harbin Factory 674 had more than 20 quality rework accidents within 14 days after the start of construction. Another example is the renovation project of the Shenyang Pneumatic Tool Factory. The plan was not realistic, and the replacement of the roof was actually completed in one and a half months, but the plan was half a month. Eighty percent of the factory's mechanical equipment installation did not meet the quality requirements. This situation is quite common on other scattered small construction sites.

    The fundamental reasons for the chaos on certain construction sites are: 1. The relationship between the two parties (甲乙) is uncoordinated, shirking responsibility and emphasizing the so-called "the other party is responsible for the problem"; on individual construction sites, the two parties (甲乙) are being emotional without principle, even to the point where Party A does not understand Party B's construction site organization and work plan, and Party B does not even know who Party A's construction site representative is, so not only can difficulties that can be overcome not be overcome, but also man-made difficulties are increased. 2. Insufficient attention is paid to ensuring project quality, especially the extremely important quality of basic engineering. Some construction sites only seek to complete the task one-sidedly; some adopt a segmented approach of organizing construction first and then ensuring quality; some conduct responsibility system movements in isolation, which are not well integrated with ensuring project quality; and some even affect project quality due to saving materials or using waste materials. The quality inspection organizations of these units are not sound, and the number of technical personnel equipped at the construction site is also very small. 3. The leading cadres of these units have conservative thinking and bureaucratic work styles, and they do not actively mobilize all employees and rely on all employees to overcome difficulties, but often emphasize objective difficulties, such as weak technical strength, failure to meet labor wage quotas, etc., but they lack the spirit of how to give full play to subjective initiative and study how to overcome these difficulties. Many units are also doing a very poor job in employee safety and welfare, such as the phenomena of leaky temporary housing and eating undercooked food on certain construction sites in Shenyang, which have not been improved in a timely manner. 4. A large number of administrative management personnel and work cadres who have been newly transferred to the capital construction department are unfamiliar with the business and lack work experience, and the leadership has not done enough to explain the methods and introduce experience to them, resulting in many loopholes in their work.

    The main reason for the above-mentioned problems that have occurred and exist in certain projects in the Northeast region is that no one is responsible for the construction. Currently, the entire region is widely carrying out the responsibility system campaign, so that the situation of the second and especially the third categories of projects can be rapidly improved and gradually catch up with the first category of projects, so as to achieve the comprehensive requirements of good, fast, economical, and safe.

    东北第一期工程全面开工
    各单位普遍开展建立责任制运动
    【本报讯】东北区今年第一期基本建设工程已普遍开工，各工程单位正大力开展建立责任制运动。到目前为止，全区开工的建筑工程面积已达二百六十三万平方公尺。在这些开工的工程中，包括三十余万平方公尺的重要厂房工程及哈尔滨医科大学、沈阳农学院、中国科学院长春综合研究所等重大的土木建筑工程。鞍山已开工的土木建筑工程占全年工程百分之六十以上，沈阳已开工的土木建筑工程占全年工程百分之三十六，哈尔滨已开工的土木建筑工程占全年工程的百分之三十二。
    今年鞍山钢铁公司大型轧钢厂和无缝钢管厂，机械七厂，及电业系统的机电安装工程和煤矿系统今年续建的七对半竖井工程，也都准时开工，工程进展很迅速。鞍山钢铁公司大型轧钢厂今年机械安装已完成全年计划的百分之五十一点二；无缝钢管厂除电气安装外，机械安装工程已基本完成。电业系统已顺利完成两座巨型发电机的安装，并又开始了新的巨型发电机的安装工作。机械七厂也已完成全年计划安装台数的百分之三十九。煤矿续建七对半竖井工程，截至四月底已完成全年计划工程量百分之四十八点五；两处露天矿建设截至五月十五日已完成全年剥离量百分之六十八点五，其中阜新海州露天矿可在七月初开始生产，新建及改建二十一处斜井工程，截至五月十五日掘进完成年计划的百分之三十七点七，砌?完成年计划百分之三十六点五。
    在资源勘察方面，现已有数百台钻探机在十二个重点矿区进行黑色金属、有色金属和煤矿的钻探工程。重点地区的地质普查、精查工作也已开始。城市建设工程方面，沈阳、鞍山、哈尔滨、长春、旅大等城市的上下水道、水源地、煤气管道、重要铁路、桥梁等工程已大部开工。全长九十九点五公里的森林铁路工程及新建全长二百七十五公里的公路工程，也已开工。
    现已开工的工程，由于准备工作的好坏不同，领导力量的强弱不同，以及其他有关条件的不同，发展仍是不平衡的。大致可划分为以下三类：第一类是开工情况较好的，如鞍钢的大型轧钢厂、无缝钢管厂、薄板厂工地，某地发电机安装，阜新海州露天矿，一○五工地，电工四厂大型电机车间工地等。这类工程的特点是：一、在施工前编制了较为完善的施工组织设计，保证了材料、预制品、工具及水、电等有计划的供应。二、依据平均先进定额和合理的施工方法来确定工程进度和施工作业计划，并经过工人群众的讨论，分工种和按班组的不同情况，做出具体规定，在此基础上订立施工员与工段、工段与工段、工段与小组等的联系合同，以互相保证按工程指示图表进行作业。三、分部、分项订出工程的技术质量标准，连同操作规程，采取口授和模型展览等方式向工人进行教育，使工人能接受运用，并建立甲乙双方独立的质量检查组织及群众性的质量检查制度。四、甲乙双方都具有积极完成国家建设计划的精神，互相合作、主动克服困难，分工解决问题，有些还成立联合办公室或建立隔日会议，及时交换意见，推动工作。
    第二类的情况是有了一般的技术物质准备，但还不周密；组织工作的准备也不充分，因而施工组织设计和施工作业计划不完全切合实际，技术质量标准和技术操作规程也不完备，特别是没有认真地发动工人来讨论贯彻；施工管理一般化，因而在开工之初，在基础工程质量、劳动力组织、职工生活供应各方面，都或多或少地存在些问题。但由于甲乙双方还能积极主动地协商解决问题，并正在加强对工地的领导，通过发动职工建立责任制度，使情况得到好转。这一类型的单位在已开工的单位中所占比重比较大。
    属于第三类的施工情况比较混乱，施工进度迟缓，质量事故频繁，浪费很大。如哈尔滨六七四厂工地在开工后的十四天内，发生质量返工事故达二十余次。再如沈阳风动工具厂厂房改建工程，计划不切合实际，换房盖工程实际得一个半月才能竣工，但计划却是半个月。该厂机械设备安装后百分之八十不合质量要求。在其他分散的小型工地上，这种情况是相当普遍的。
    某些工地发生混乱现象的根本原因是：一、甲乙双方关系不协调，互相推诿，强调所谓“出了问题由对方负责”；个别工地的甲乙双方，无原则地闹意气，甚至甲方不了解乙方的工地组织配备及工作计划，而乙方连甲方的工地代表是谁都不知道，因而不仅是可能克服的困难不能克服，而且增加了人为的困难。二、对保证工程质量特别是极重要的基础工程质量，重视不够，有些工地只求片面完成任务；有些是采取了先组织开工再搞质量的分割做法；有些则孤立地搞责任制运动，与保证工程质量结合得不好；甚至有因节省材料或利用废材而影响工程质量的。这些单位质量检查组织不健全，工地配备的技术人员也很少。三、这些单位的领导干部有保守思想和官僚主义作风，不积极发动全体职工、依靠全体职工来克服困难，而经常强调客观困难，如技术力量弱、劳动工资定额达不到等等，但如何发挥主观能动性，研究如何克服这些困难的精神则很差。不少单位对职工的安全、福利做得也很差，如沈阳某些工地的暂设工房漏雨及吃生饭的现象，没有得到及时的改善。四、一大批新调到基本建设部门的行政管理人员与工作干部，业务生疏，缺乏工作经验，领导上向他们交代办法、介绍经验做得不够，以致在工作中发生了许多漏洞。
    东北区某些工程中发生与存在以上问题，主要原因是施工中无人负责。现全区正在广泛开展建立责任制运动，要使第二类特别是第三类工程情况迅速地得到改善，逐渐赶上第一类工程，以达到好、快、省与安全的全面要求。
