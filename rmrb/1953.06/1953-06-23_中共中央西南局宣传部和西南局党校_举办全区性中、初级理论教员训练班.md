    The Propaganda Department and Party School of the Southwest Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, in accordance with the "Directive of the CPC Central Committee on the Theoretical Education of Cadres in 1953-1954," jointly organized intermediate and junior theory instructor training classes in late April. After nearly a month of preparation, classes began in mid-May. A total of 60 theory instructors from intermediate groups of organs above the prefectural committee level in the Southwest region, 7 education cadres managing the theoretical study of the intermediate groups, 103 theory instructors from junior groups of first-level organs in the Southwest and Chongqing, and 82 education cadres managing the theoretical study of the junior groups participated in the training classes, all concentrated at the Party School of the Southwest Bureau for study. The theory instructors in the intermediate groups generally have a high school education or above and are party member cadres at or above the county level. The content of their study is Chapters 9 to 12 of the "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)" and the 26 articles that the CPC Central Committee has stipulated as required reading for senior groups. The theory instructors in the junior groups generally have a high school education or above and are party member cadres at or above the district level. The content of their study is the "Reader of Common Knowledge of Economic Construction" serialized in the junior edition of "Study" magazine. The training time is scheduled for three months.

    Comrade Liao Jingdan, Deputy Director of the Propaganda Department of the Southwest Bureau, gave the first lecture to the training class on May 20. Based on the central instructions, he explained the purpose and significance of studying theory, especially studying economic construction theory, at the present time. At the same time, he gave instructions on the responsibilities of theory instructors and the attitudes and methods that should be adopted in learning, as well as the key points for the intermediate group to study the "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)." Comrade Deng Chenxi, Director of the Southwest Office of the All-China Federation of Cooperatives, is lecturing on Chapter 9 of the "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)" and the related eight articles in the intermediate group's curriculum. He is expected to give four lectures and has already given two. The courses for the junior group have also begun. Some responsible comrades from the bureaus of the Southwest Financial and Economic Committee system are lecturing for the junior group theory instructors.

    The Party School of the Southwest Bureau is responsible for formulating the learning points for each chapter of the training class and providing them to the students as guidelines for reading. In order to ensure that the students can truly undertake teaching work when they return in the future, at the end of each chapter of study, each person is required to independently write a personal lecture outline. After selection and multiple studies and revisions by the group and the entire class, a unified and roughly usable lecture outline is compiled at the end of the training class and distributed to each person to take back as a basis for future lectures.

    The propaganda departments and party schools of the Sichuan, Guizhou, and Yunnan provincial party committees will all hold training classes for theory instructors in the junior groups. Sichuan and Guizhou provinces have already formulated specific plans.

    In addition, at the same time as preparing for the above-mentioned theory instructor training classes, the Propaganda Department of the Southwest Bureau notified the propaganda departments of the provincial (municipal) party committees to carefully organize the end-of-term examinations and the work of adjusting the grades of cadres in theoretical study. It was determined that senior cadres and senior groups currently studying the book "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR" must make a good end to the course before the end of June, so that they can start studying Chapters 9 to 12 of the "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)" in July in accordance with the unified regulations of the CPC Central Committee. The intermediate groups currently studying "History of the Communist Party of China" and the junior groups studying "Political Common Sense" must end their courses by the end of September at the latest, so that they can appropriately switch to the study of the "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)" (intermediate group) and the "Reader of Common Knowledge of Economic Construction" (junior group). The main provisions for the concluding work of the current courses are: (1) Those who study the book "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR" should each write an article on their learning gains. Those who study the courses "History of the Communist Party of China" and "Political Common Sense" must first review and then take a test before the end of the course. (2) The level of study should be adjusted mainly based on the results of the end-of-term examinations and daily study, and the tendency to regard the level of study as a political treatment should be effectively corrected.

    中共中央西南局宣传部和西南局党校
    举办全区性中、初级理论教员训练班
    中共中央西南局宣传部和西南局党校根据“中共中央关于一九五三——一九五四年干部理论教育的指示”，于四月下旬共同筹办了中级和初级理论教员训练班。经过将近一月的筹备，已于五月中旬开学。参加训练班的共有西南全区地委以上机关中级组理论教员六十名，管理中级组理论学习的教育干部七名，西南一级机关和重庆市各机关初级组理论教员一百零三名，管理初级组理论学习的教育干部八十二名，全部集中西南局党校学习。中级组理论教员一般都是具有高中以上文化水平的县级以上党员干部；学习内容为“联共（布）党史”第九章至第十二章和中共中央规定高级组必读的二十六篇文章。初级组理论教员一般都是具有高中以上文化水平的区级以上的党员干部；学习内容为“学习”杂志初级版连载的“经济建设常识读本”。训练时间预定三个月。
    西南局宣传部副部长廖井丹同志，于五月二十日给训练班讲了第一次课，他根据中央指示，说明当前学习理论，特别是学习经济建设理论的目的与意义，同时对理论教员的责任和学习中应有的态度与方法，以及中级组学习“联共（布）党史”的重点均作了指示。中级组课程中的“联共（布）党史”第九章及有关的八篇文章，由中华全国合作社联合总社西南区办事处主任邓辰西同志讲授，预计讲四次，现已讲过两次。初级组的课程也已开始讲授，为初级组理论教员讲课的，有西南财委系统各局的
    一部分负责同志。
    训练班的辅导工作，由西南局党校负责拟定每一章的学习要点，供给学员作为阅读时的要领。为使学员们将来回去确能担任讲授工作，在每一章学习告一段落时，要求每人独立编写一份个人的讲授提纲，经过小组和全班的选择和多次的研究、修改，于训练班结束时，再编成一份统一的大致可用的讲授提纲，发给每个人带回去作为将来讲课的依据。
    四川、贵州、云南等省委宣传部和党校，均将举办初级组的理论教员训练班，四川、贵州两省业已订出具体计划。
    此外，与筹办上述理论教员训练班同时，西南局宣传部通知各省（市）委宣传部，要很好地组织在职干部理论学习的期终考试和调整编级的工作。确定目前学习“苏联社会主义经济问题”一书之高级干部和高级组，均须于六月底以前作一很好的结束，以便于七月份开始按照中共中央统一规定学习“联共（布）党史”第九章至第十二章。目前学习“中共党史”之中级组和学习“政治常识”之初级组，最迟须于九月底结束，以便适时地转入“联共（布）党史”（中级组）和“经济建设常识读本”（初级组）的学习。现行课程的结束工作，主要规定两项：（一）学习“苏联社会主义经济问题”一书者，每人就学习收获写一篇文章，学习“中共党史”和“政治常识”课程的，均须于结束前先经复习然后举行测验。（二）主要根据期终考试和平日学习的成绩评定，调整学级，切实纠正把编级看成政治待遇的偏向。
