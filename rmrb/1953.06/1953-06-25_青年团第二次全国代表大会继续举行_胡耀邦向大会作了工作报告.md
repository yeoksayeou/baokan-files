    Second National Congress of the Communist Youth League Continues
    Hu Yaobang Delivers Work Report to the Congress
    [Xinhua News Agency, June 24th] The Second National Congress of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League continued on the 24th.
    The executive chairmen of the congress were Liao Chengzhi, Li Chao, Jia Shouyi, Wu Qunbo, and Huang Jiafu. At today's congress, Hu Yaobang, secretary of the First Central Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League, delivered a report entitled "Unite the Youth of the Whole Country, and Advance Courageously in the Great Ranks of Building the Motherland."
    Hu Yaobang said that at this congress, we will review what we have done for the motherland and study how we should respond to the motherland's hopes for us in the new era. After describing the work achievements and experiences gained by the Chinese New Democratic Youth League in the past four years, he pointed out: Now our motherland has begun to enter a period of construction. During the construction period, the general task of the Youth League is to unite the youth of the whole country under the leadership of the Party and under the teachings of Chairman Mao to work selflessly for the construction of the motherland and to study diligently for the construction of the motherland. In the great struggle to build the motherland, we must assist the Party in educating League members and youth with Marxism-Leninism, so that they become a young generation that loves the motherland, is loyal to the people, knowledgeable, disciplined, brave, hardworking, energetic, and unafraid of any difficulties, follow the direction pointed out by our great leader Chairman Mao, and strive to realize national industrialization and gradually transition to a socialist society.
    In his report, Hu Yaobang explained the specific tasks of the Youth League on various fronts and pointed out the importance of tirelessly strengthening the friendship and unity between Chinese youth and peace-loving and democratic youth of all countries.
    Then, he focused on the core issue in the current youth movement—the combination of learning and work. He emphasized that youth and League members must have both a communist outlook on life and morality, and a proficiency in professional knowledge.
    Hu Yaobang pointed out that the organizational work of the Youth League must adopt a policy of consolidation and forward development in the coming period. It is necessary to consolidate the organization of the League ideologically, politically, and organizationally. This requires strengthening the education of League members, vigorously training cadres, improving grassroots organizations, enhancing the organization and discipline of the League, and making necessary adjustments to some loose organizations.
    Hu Yaobang concluded by saying that all the work of the Youth League is carried out under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. All our achievements should be attributed to the glorious and great Chinese Communist Party and our great leader and teacher Chairman Mao. The great Chairman Mao is always concerned about the growth of our young generation's communist qualities and construction talents. We will never fail the expectations of the Party and Chairman Mao, and we will always be loyal to the Party and loyal to the cause of the people.
    On the morning of the 24th, 790 delegates attended the congress, and 147 people attended as observers. All the representatives unanimously approved the agenda of the congress, the list of members of the credentials committee, and the list of members of the proposals examination committee.
    Kang Nai'er, secretary-general of the congress, announced that the congress had received 238 congratulatory telegrams and letters from home and abroad, and read out on the meeting congratulatory telegrams from Nguyen Lam, member of the Standing Committee of the Vietnamese Youth League and secretary of the Vietnamese Youth National Salvation Corps; the Central Committee of the Romanian Labor Youth League; the Central Committee of the Burmese People's Youth League; the Northeast Bureau of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party; and all members of the Communist Youth League of the Railway Corps of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, and the Anshan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party.
    In the afternoon of the 24th and the morning of the 25th, all the representatives will discuss in groups the important instructions on the work of the Youth League in the congratulatory speech by Comrade Liu Shaoqi, representative of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, and the work report of Hu Yaobang.

    【新华社二十四日讯】中国新民主主义青年团第二次全国代表大会二十四日继续举行。
    大会执行主席为廖承志、李超、贾守义、吴群波、黄家富。在今日的大会上，中国新民主主义青年团第一届中央委员会书记胡耀邦向大会作了题为“团结全国青年，在建设祖国的伟大行列中奋勇前进”的报告。
    胡耀邦说，在这次大会上，我们将回顾一下我们为祖国作了些什么，研究一下我们应该如何地回答祖国对我们在新时期的希望。他在叙述了四年来中国新民主主义青年团的工作成绩和取得的经验后指出：现在我们祖国已开始进入建设时期，在建设时期，青年团的总任务就是，在党的领导下，在毛主席的教诲下，团结全国青年为建设祖国而忘我地劳动，为建设祖国而奋发地学习。在建设祖国的伟大斗争中，协助党以马克思列宁主义教育团员和青年，使他们成为热爱祖国、忠于人民、有知识、守纪律、勇敢勤劳、朝气蓬勃、不怕任何困难的年轻的一代，遵循我们伟大领袖毛主席指引的方向，为实现国家工业化和逐步过渡到社会主义社会而奋斗。
    胡耀邦在报告中分别说明了青年团在各个战线上的具体任务，并指出努力不懈地加强中国青年和世界各国爱好和平民主的青年的友谊和团结的重要性。
    接着，他又着重提出了当前青年运动中的核心问题——学习和工作相结合的问题，他强调地说，青年和青年团员既要有共产主义的人生观和道德观，又要有精通业务的知识。
    胡耀邦指出：青年团的组织工作在今后一个时期内，必须采取巩固地向前发展的方针。必须从思想上、政治上和组织上来巩固团的组织，这就要加强对团员的教育，大力培养干部，健全基层组织，增强团的组织性和纪律性，并对某些散漫的组织作必要的整理。
    胡耀邦最后说：青年团的一切工作都是在中国共产党的领导下进行的。我们的一切成就都应归功于光荣的伟大的中国共产党和我们伟大的领袖和导师毛主席。伟大的毛主席时时刻刻关怀着我们青年一代的共产主义品质和建设才能的成长。我们绝不辜负党和毛主席的期望，我们永远忠实于党，忠实于人民的事业。
