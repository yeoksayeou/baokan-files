Xinhua News Agency, June 25th: According to Vietnam News Agency, on June 19th, the Vietnamese People's Army suddenly attacked the French-occupied Haiphong Port, burning a large amount of gasoline and ammunition stored by the French army, causing heavy losses to the French army. According to preliminary statistics, the People's Army burned one French army ammunition depot, one gasoline depot, and one lubricating oil depot, as well as 8,000 barrels of kerosene (totaling 1.6 million liters) in this attack.

The People's Army also destroyed 70 French military vehicles.

The burned gasoline and lubricating oil depots had a total of sixteen oil pools, storing a large amount of fuel; the ammunition depot stored a large amount of artillery shells and bombs for the French army on the North Vietnamese battlefield. These oil depots and ammunition depots started burning at 1:00 AM on the 19th and had not been extinguished by late at night.

Xinhua News Agency, June 25th: According to Vietnam News Agency, from early March to mid-May, the Vietnamese People's Army continuously attacked the French army's important transportation lines and strongholds on the north bank of the Red River, eliminating a large number of French troops in the provinces of Kien An, Hai Duong, Hung Yen, and Thai Binh.

According to statistics, during this period, the People's Army eliminated a total of 4,796 French troops, of which 2,016 surrendered or were captured.

The People's Army captured 499 machine guns, 1,300 rifles and pistols, 22 mortars and rocket launchers, and a large amount of ammunition and equipment. These weapons and ammunition are enough to equip a regular regiment. The People's Army also destroyed 454 French military vehicles, 30 train cars and locomotives, 85 tons of ammunition, and a large amount of gasoline.

Xinhua News Agency, June 21st: According to Vietnam News Agency, North Vietnam, June 19th: The Vietnamese People's Army continues to attack French strongholds and transportation lines in the rainy Red River Delta.

In the first seven days of June, the People's Army launched several attacks in the provinces of Nam Dinh and Quang Yen, eliminating three French strongholds and killing more than 350 French troops.

During these seven days, the People's Army continuously attacked the French transportation lines from Hanoi to various places, sinking a French gunboat between Hanoi and Nam Dinh, and severely damaging a French steamer between Hanoi and Son Tay. Prior to this, the People's Army had destroyed five French vehicles on Highway No. 5 from Hanoi to Haiphong, including two tanks.

In the Northwest region, on May 23rd, the People's Army ambushed two French platoons at a pass northeast of Lai Chau, killing and wounding 43 French troops.

Xinhua News Agency, June 19th: According to Vietnam News Agency, more and more Bao Dai puppet soldiers are unwilling to serve as cannon fodder for the French aggressors. Some puppet soldiers cut themselves with knives to avoid going out on patrol or participating in combat; some puppet soldiers deserted the enemy ranks.

In Thanh Liem County, Ha Nam Province, recently about 50 puppet soldiers surrendered to the people. In some other counties in the province, many puppet soldiers resolutely fought and deserted the puppet army. French officers are now less willing to allow puppet soldiers to go home on leave, fearing that they will never return.

In Bac Ninh Province, more than 300 puppet soldiers deserted the enemy ranks in the first four months of this year. The people of the province resolutely resisted the French colonialists' forced conscription, saving more than 800 young people from being seized as cannon fodder.

    越南人民军英勇袭击海防港获得重大战果
    红河北岸人民军两个多月歼灭法军四千七百余人
    【新华社二十五日讯】据越南通讯社讯：六月十九日，越南人民军突然袭击法军侵占的海防港，烧毁法军储存的大量汽油和弹药，使法军遭到惨重损失。据初步统计，人民军在这次袭击中共烧毁法军弹药库、汽油库和润滑油库各一座，以及火油八千桶（共计一百六十万公升）。
    人民军同时击毁法国的军用车辆七十辆。
    被烧毁的汽油库和润滑油库共有十六个油池，存有大量油料；弹药库则贮存有供北越战场法军使用的大量炮弹和炸弹。这些油库和弹药库从十九日早晨一时开始燃烧，到深夜还未熄灭。
    【新华社二十五日讯】据越南通讯社讯：从三月初到五月中旬，越南人民军不断进攻红河北岸的法军重要交通线和据点，在建安、海阳、兴安、太平等省歼灭大量法军。
    据统计，在这期间，人民军共歼灭法军四千七百九十六人，其中投降和被俘的共二千零一十六人。
    人民军共缴获机枪四百九十九挺、步枪和手枪一千三百支、迫击炮和火箭炮二十二门，以及大量的弹药和装备。这些武器和弹药足够装备一个正规团。人民军同时击毁法军军用车辆四百五十四辆、车皮和机车三十辆、弹药八十五吨和许多汽油。
    【新华社二十一日讯】据越南通讯社北越十九日讯：越南人民军在多雨的红河三角洲继续袭击法军的据点和交通线。
    在六月份的头七天中，人民军曾在南定、广安等省多次出击，拔除法军据点三处，歼灭法军三百五十多人。
    在这七天中，人民军不断袭击从河内通到各地去的法军交通线，在河内、南定间击沉法军炮艇一艘，在河内、山西间又重创法军汽船一艘。在此以前，人民军曾在河内通往海防的第五号公路上击毁法军车辆五辆，其中有两辆坦克。
    在西北地区，人民军五月二十三日在莱州东北的一个隘口处截击法军两个排，打死打伤法军四十三人。
       【新华社十九日讯】据越南通讯社讯：愈来愈多的保大伪军士兵不愿替法国侵略军当炮灰。有些伪军士兵用刀子割伤自己，以便逃避出去巡逻或参加作战；有些伪军士兵脱离了敌人的队伍。
    在河南省清廉县，最近约有五十名伪军归顺了人民。在该省其他一些县份，很多伪军士兵，坚决进行斗争，脱离了伪军。法国军官现在不大敢让伪军请假回家，因为害怕他们一去再也不回来。
    在北宁省，今年的头四个月有三百多名伪军脱离敌人的队伍。该省人民坚决反抗法国殖民者强征壮丁，使八百多个青年免于被抓去充当炮灰。
