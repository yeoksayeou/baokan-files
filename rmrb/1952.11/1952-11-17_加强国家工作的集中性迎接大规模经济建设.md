    The 19th meeting of the Central People's Government Committee passed the "Decision on Changing the Structure and Tasks of the People's Governments (Military and Administrative Committees) of Greater Administrative Areas," the "Resolution on Adjusting the Establishment of Provinces and Regions," and the "Resolution on Establishing Additional Agencies of the Central People's Government." These decisions and resolutions are important measures to adapt to the new situation and new tasks of the large-scale planned economic and cultural construction that will begin nationwide in 1953, to strengthen the "leadership of the Central People's Government over various tasks," and to strengthen the organization and leadership responsibilities of provincial and municipal people's governments. It is also a major constructive improvement in the construction of political power since the establishment of the Central People’s Government.
    The People's Governments or Military and Administrative Committees of the Greater Administrative Areas were established at the beginning of the founding of New China. On the one hand, they were representative organs of the Central People's Government; on the other hand, they were the highest organs of local power. This form of organization was absolutely necessary when the country had just been liberated and the development of work in various regions was uneven. As pointed out in the Common Program, this is a measure that "is conducive to national unity and also conducive to adapting to local conditions." The facts of the past three years have also fully proved this. In the past three years, we have carried out three major movements nationwide: land reform, suppression of counter-revolutionaries, and resistance to the US and aid to Korea, as well as large-scale mass-based reform work. In order to strengthen the leadership over these movements and various reform tasks, based on the unified guidelines and policies formulated by the Central Government, and based on the specific conditions of various regions, relying on some strong leading organs of the major administrative regions that are sufficient to represent the Central Government, adapting to local conditions, leading local governments at all levels, deeply mobilizing the masses, and concretely implementing the central government's policies, this is completely in line with the interests of the people's democratic revolution. Under the unified guidance of the Central Government, the People's Governments or Military and Administrative Committees of the Greater Administrative Areas have formulated some local specific regulations, specifically stipulating the methods and steps for carrying out various movements, and promoted various reform tasks, which undoubtedly played a great role. In addition, in the past three years, we have also carried out arduous economic recovery and reconstruction work across the country. In these tasks, due to the uneven economic development in various regions, and due to the differences in the timing of the liberation and democratic reforms in various regions, we could not force a unified pace of work. Therefore, it was also necessary for the Central Government to authorize the leading organs of the Greater Administrative Areas to adapt to the situation, weigh the priorities, and strive to restore and reconstruct the economy. Under the unified leadership of the Central Government, the Greater Administrative Areas have basically completed the work of economic recovery and reconstruction in the past three years. Northeast China began large-scale economic construction with key focuses in 1952; and the national industrial and agricultural production this year has generally exceeded the highest pre-war levels. These are all major achievements that cannot be ignored.
    However, after three years of various social reform movements and economic recovery and reconstruction work, we are now facing a new situation and new tasks. That is, starting from 1953, we will end the country's economic recovery and reconstruction work and begin large-scale planned economic and cultural construction across the country, in order to put our country on the road to industrialization as soon as possible. In the future, in addition to the movement to resist the US and aid Korea, because of the US imperialism's insistence on detaining prisoners of war, continuing the war of aggression against Korea, we must continue to resolutely carry it out. Other various mass political movements have generally been completed, and the high tide of economic construction is about to begin.
    In order to smoothly carry out national economic construction, we need to make a lot of preparations. First of all, we must strengthen the planning of the national economy. Planned leadership of economic construction is the concentrated manifestation of the economic superiority of new democratic and socialist countries. We must organize our production according to the principles of a planned economy. In order to strengthen planning, we must also strengthen the unified and centralized leadership of the Central Government, so as to understand the situation in all aspects in a timely manner and ensure the necessary cooperation between various economic links. Therefore, the situation of greater decentralization to local governments over the past three years can no longer be adapted to today's situation. In the past, the leadership of military work, the leadership of foreign affairs work, and the leadership of public security work were unified and centralized. In the future, the unification and centralization of other aspects of work should also be further strengthened. This is the case for economic work, for cultural and educational work, and for political work.
    The first measure to strengthen unification and centralization is to streamline the levels of political power and strengthen the leadership of the central government and provinces and cities. What must be changed first is the structure and tasks of the People's Governments (Military and Administrative Committees) of the Greater Administrative Areas. According to the resolution of the 19th meeting of the Central People's Government Committee, the principle of this change is: to change all People's Governments or Military and Administrative Committees of the Greater Administrative Areas into Administrative Committees, which are only representative organs of the Central People's Government and not the highest local political power organs. The original departments of the Greater Administrative Areas are uniformly changed into bureaus or offices, one type of which is directly under the Administrative Committee of the Greater Administrative Area, and the other type of which is directly taken over by the central ministries and entrusted to the Administrative Committee of the Greater Administrative Area for management on their behalf. The original four sub-committees for political and legal affairs, financial and economic affairs, cultural and educational affairs, and people's supervision, as well as the General Office, of the Greater Administrative Areas, are still retained to assist the Administrative Committee in contacting various departments.
    Another aspect of strengthening unification and centralization is to adjust and add central agencies to ensure the enrichment and soundness of the central leadership. According to the resolution of the 19th meeting of the Central People's Government Committee, what needs to be done at present is: first, to establish the State Planning Commission of the Central People's Government in order to strengthen the implementation of the national planned economy; and second, to establish the Ministry of Higher Education of the Central People's Government in order to strengthen the training of senior specialized talents to serve national construction. At the same time, in order to improve the cultural level of the people and enhance the people's physical fitness, and to prepare forces for national construction in all aspects, it was decided to establish the Committee for Eliminating Illiteracy and the Sports Commission of the Central People's Government. This is another major measure following the "Resolution on Adjusting the Structure of the Central People's Government" passed by the 17th meeting of the Central People's Government Committee to adjust and strengthen the financial and economic departments. This will greatly promote the centralization and planning of national work.
    The 19th meeting of the Central People's Government Committee also decided to adjust the establishment of provinces and regions, which is also completely correct. The division of provinces and regions in our country is mostly based on the original establishment, but some provinces and regions have been changed in the past three years due to the development of revolutionary work and objective needs. Some were newly divided based on the development of the War of Resistance Against Japan or the War of Liberation, such as Pingyuan, Southern Jiangsu, and Northern Jiangsu; some were temporarily divided into several regions due to the vast territory and large population after liberation, such as Sichuan, which was divided into four regions: Eastern Sichuan, Western Sichuan, Southern Sichuan, and Northern Sichuan; and some were divided into some regions originally belonging to other provinces and regions due to the original region being too small, such as Chahar. The division of these provinces and regions was reasonable at the time, and it is equally reasonable to readjust them now.
    Obviously, the various decisions and resolutions of the Central People's Government Committee are completely in line with the needs of the current situation. These are important measures to further strengthen national unification and centralization. Therefore, we must ensure their thorough implementation in order to accept the task of large-scale national economic construction.

### 加强国家工作的集中性迎接大规模经济建设

    加强国家工作的集中性迎接大规模经济建设
    中央人民政府委员会第十九次会议，通过了“关于改变大行政区人民政府（军政委员会）机构与任务的决定”、“关于调整省、区建制的决议”、“关于增设中央人民政府机构的决议”。这些决定与决议，都是为了适应一九五三年即将开始的全国大规模的有计划的经济建设与文化建设的新形势和新任务、为了加强“中央人民政府对各项工作的领导”和加强省、市人民政府的组织与领导责任的重要措施，也是中央人民政府成立以来在政权建设工作中的一次巨大的建设性的改进。
    大行政区人民政府或军政委员会，是在新中国初建之时成立的。它在一方面是中央人民政府的代表机关；另一方面它又是地方政权的最高机关。这种组织形式，在全国刚刚解放、各地区工作发展不平衡的情况下，是完全必要的。正如共同纲领中所指出的，这是一种“既利于国家统一，又利于因地制宜”的措施。三年来的事实也完全证明了这一点。三年来，我们在全国进行了土地改革、镇压反革命、抗美援朝的三大运动和规模浩大的群众性的各项改革工作。为了加强对这些运动和各项改革工作的领导，根据中央制订的统一的方针和政策，又根据各地区的具体情况，依靠一些坚强的足以代表中央的各大行政区的领导机关，因地制宜地领导地方各级政府，深入地发动群众，具体贯彻中央的方针与政策，这是完全符合于人民民主革命的利益的。各大行政区人民政府或军政委员会，过去在中央的统一方针下，制订了一些地方性的单行条例，具体地规定了各项运动进行的方法和步骤，推动了各项改革工作，这些无疑地都起了很大的作用。此外，过去三年中，我们在全国还进行了艰巨的经济恢复与改建的工作。在这些工作中，由于各地经济发展的不平衡，由于各地区的解放和民主改革的实施有先后的差别，工作步调也不能强求一致，因而中央授权各大行政区领导机关，适应情况，权衡轻重缓急，努力恢复与改建经济，也是必要的。各大行政区在中央统一领导之下，三年来在基本上完成了经济恢复与改建工作。东北区一九五二年已开始了有重点的大规模经济建设；全国工农业生产，今年一般地也都超过战前最高水平。这些都是不可忽视的重大成绩。
    但是，经过了三年来的各项社会改革运动及经济恢复与改建工作以后，目前我们正面临着一种新的形势和新的任务。这就是从一九五三年开始，我们即将结束国家经济的恢复和改建工作，开始全国大规模的有计划的经济建设与文化建设，以便尽快地使我国走上工业化的道路。今后，除了抗美援朝运动，由于美帝国主义坚持扣留战俘的荒谬主张，继续侵朝战争，使我们必须继续坚决进行以外，其它各种群众性的政治运动大体已经完成了，经济建设的高潮即将开始了。
    为了顺利地进行国家的经济建设，我们需要作很多的准备工作。首先必须加强国家经济的计划性。对于经济建设有计划的领导，乃是新民主主义和社会主义国家经济优越性的集中的表现。我们必须根据计划经济的原则，来组织我们的生产。而为了加强计划性，又必须加强中央的统一和集中的领导，以便及时了解各方面的情况，确保各个经济环节之间的应有的合作。因此，三年来地方分权较多的情况，就不再能够适合于今天的形势了。过去，军事工作的领导、外交工作的领导、公安工作的领导都是统一和集中的。今后，其它各方面的工作也都要进一步加强统一和集中。经济工作如此，文化教育工作如此，政治工作也应如此。
    加强统一和集中的第一个措施，就是精简政权层次，加强中央和省、市的领导。首先必须改变的是大行政区人民政府（军政委员会）的机构与任务。根据中央人民政府委员会第十九次会议的决议，这项改变工作的原则是：将大行政区人民政府或军政委员会一律改为行政委员会，仅为中央人民政府的代表机关，而不作为地方的最高政权机关。原有大行政区的各部一律改为局或处，其中一类是直属于大区行政委员会的，一类是由中央各部直接接管而委托大区行政委员会代管的。原有大行政区的政治法律、财政经济、文化教育、人民监察四个分委员会和办公厅，仍然保留，协助行政委员会与各部联系。
    加强统一和集中的另一方面工作，就是调整与增设中央机构，保证中央领导机构的充实和健全。根据中央人民政府委员会第十九次会议的决议，目前须要着手进行的，一是为了加强国家计划经济的执行而成立中央人民政府国家计划委员会；一是为了加强培养为国家建设服务的高级专门人才而成立中央人民政府高等教育部；同时为了提高人民群众文化程度和增强人民的体质，为国家各方面建设工作准备力量，决定成立中央人民政府扫除文盲工作委员会和体育运动委员会。这是继中央人民政府委员会第十七次会议通过“关于调整中央人民政府机构的决议”，调整与增强财经各部门之后的又一重大措施。这样就使中央人民政府的领导机构更加完备，更加健全。这将大大地推进国家工作的集中性与计划性。
    中央人民政府委员会第十九次会议还决定调整省、区的建制，这也是完全正确的。我国省、区的划分，目前大部分都是按照原有建制的，但某些省、区，由于革命工作发展的情况和客观的需要，过去三年中，曾有变动。有的是依据抗日战争或解放战争发展的形势，作了新的划分，如平原、苏南、苏北；有的是因地广人多、解放后为了便于领导，临时划成几个地区的，如四川被划为川东川西川南川北四个区域；还有一些则由于原有地区过小，划入了一部分原属其它省、区的地区，如察哈尔就是这样的。这些省区的划分在当时是合理的，现在重新加以调整同样是合理的。
    显然的，中央人民政府委员会的各项决定和决议，完全符合于目前形势的需要。这些都是进一步加强国家统一和集中的重要措施。因此，我们必须保证其彻底实现，以便接受国家大规模的经济建设的任务。
