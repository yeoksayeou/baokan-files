    Learning from the Great Artists of the Soviet Union
    Mei Lanfang
    How grateful we are to our dear Comrade Stalin and the Arts Committee of the Soviet Council of Ministers! During the great "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month," they sent the most famous Soviet artists to visit China, giving the Chinese people and our comrades engaged in artistic work this exceptionally valuable opportunity for practical learning.
    I am immensely honored to be able to see the performances of the famous Soviet artists and the Soviet Army Alexandrov Red Flag Song and Dance Ensemble! Each of their performances is extremely wonderful. I believe that only in the great Soviet state can there be such beautiful art and such outstanding artists.
    Every performance reached a high level of achievement and a state of perfection, leaving people in awe! Allow me, from the perspective of an actor, to briefly explain my understanding of Soviet art, taking the graceful dances of the Soviet artists as an example.
    Ulanova's performance is a high form of classical dance art. From her dance, one can see how soft, light, and beautiful her every movement is! The several poses in which Kondratov lifts her present themselves to us like the most adorable living plaster statues. The outstanding performance of such a talented artist is admirable.
    Sokolova and Pomazkov's performance of "The Hunter and the Bird" is wonderful. This dance can transform the object about to be fiercely shot into the closest companion in an extremely harmonious and natural way. It is extremely rare to complete such a complex transformation of "turning enemies into friends" in such a short dance! In particular, Comrade Sokolova, in her role as the little bird, completely transforms into the character, becoming so gentle, charming, lively, and lovable. During her performance, we, the audience, completely forget about Comrade Sokolova, because she uses a supreme artistic power to guide the audience into a poetic realm, completely unfolding the impression of a wonderful and lovable little bird in the minds of the audience. This should be said to be even more commendable than an actor's skill in transforming into a character in a play, whether it is this kind of person or that kind of person.
    The outstanding performance of Karachova and Putchin's soft gymnastics is also something I have never seen before in my life. If Putchin's performance is compared to a high mountain, then Karachova's performance is like a cloud of rosy dawn surrounding the mountain! This dance of strength and softness constitutes an extremely varied and beautiful picture. What is especially worth mentioning is that their thrilling and tense performance is actually performed so lightly that the audience completely forgets the feeling of worry and heaviness. How can such a wonderful state be achieved? It should be said to be a miracle!
    Due to limitations of space and time, it is not yet possible to conduct a comprehensive and systematic study and analysis of all the wonderful programs, but it can be said with certainty that all the performing arts are filled with a vigorous, healthy, and joyful spirit of revolutionary optimism, and this spirit greatly moves us! We are thus more clearly aware that the reason for such a high level of achievement in art is entirely the result of the long-term diligent study and hard practice of Soviet artists in the cause of communist construction. This is of extremely great significance for the encouragement and inspiration of our Chinese art workers. Therefore, how we can more effectively learn from Soviet artists in the future, learn from their noble qualities, learn from their outstanding creations, learn from their advanced experience, and learn from their spirit of faithfully pursuing art with diligent study and hard practice, is an important topic for the Chinese art world. I myself am willing to encourage this together with comrades engaged in artistic work.

    向苏联伟大的艺术家们学习
    梅兰芳
    我们多么感谢亲爱的斯大林同志和苏联部长会议艺术委员会啊！在伟大的“中苏友好月”中，他们派出苏联最著名的艺术家们访问中国，使中国人民和我们从事艺术工作的同志们得到这个异常珍贵的实际学习的机会。
    我能够看到苏联著名艺术家和苏军亚历山大罗夫红旗歌舞团的演出，感到无上光荣！他们的每一个节目的演出，都是极其精彩的，我认为只有在伟大的苏维埃国家，才会有这样优美的艺术，才会有这样杰出的艺术家。
    每一个节目的表演，都达到了高度的成就，都达到了炉火纯青的境界，令人惊叹观止！让我从作为一个演员的角度，仅就苏联艺术家的优美的舞蹈为例，来概括地说明我对苏维埃艺术的认识。
    乌兰诺娃的表演，是一种高度的古典舞蹈艺术，从她的舞蹈里，看出她的一起一落，是何等柔和轻松而美丽！康德拉托夫把她举起来的几个姿势呈露在我们面前的，就好像是一尊最可爱的、活的石膏像似的。这种天才艺术家的卓越表演，是令人敬佩的。
    索科洛娃和波马兹科夫的“猎人与鸟”的表演，是奇妙的。这个舞蹈能够极其和谐自然地把正要猛烈射击的对象，变成最亲密的友伴；在这样短短的舞蹈中，完成了这样复杂的“化敌为友”的转化，是极其难能的！特别是索科洛娃同志饰演小鸟，作到完全化为角色，化得那样轻柔依人，那样活泼可爱，我们观众在她的表演过程中，完全忘却了索科洛娃同志，因为她以一种最高的艺术力量，把观众诱导到一种诗的境界，在观众的心目中，完全展开了一只美妙可爱的小鸟的印象。这比演员在戏剧中饰演这一种人或者那一种人的化为角色的功夫，应该说是更为难能的。
    卡拉巧娃和普奇岑的柔软体操的杰出的表演，也是我生平见所未见的。如果把普奇岑同志的表演，比作一座高山，那么卡拉巧娃的表演，恰似一片绕山的云霞！这刚与柔的交舞，构成了极其多变的美丽的画面。尤其值得提出的，是他们那样惊险紧张的表演，竟会演得如此轻松，使观众完全忘却了耽心、沉重的感觉。何以达到这样美妙的境界呢？应该说是一种奇迹！
    因为篇幅和时间的限制，所有的优美的节目，暂时还不可能作全面的系统的研究和分析，但是可以肯定的说，所有的表演艺术，都是充溢着生气蓬勃健康愉快的革命乐观主义的精神，这种精神给我们极大感动！我们从而更明确了在艺术上所以有如此高度的成就，完全是苏联艺术家在从事共产主义建设事业中长期地勤学苦练的结果。这对于我们中国艺术工作者的鞭策和鼓舞，是有极其重大的意义的。因此，我们今后如何更切实有效地向苏联艺术家学习，学习他们高贵的品质，学习他们卓越的创造，学习他们先进的经验，学习他们忠实于艺术勤学苦练的精神，是我们中国艺术界重要的课题。我自己愿和从事艺术工作的同志们共勉。
