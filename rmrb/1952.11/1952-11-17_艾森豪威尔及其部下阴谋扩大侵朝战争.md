Xinhua News Agency, November 16th: The American election has just concluded, and Eisenhower's promises to the American voters about quickly ending the Korean War are still ringing in their ears. However, news from American news agencies reveals that what Eisenhower and his subordinates have been secretly planning is not to seek peace in Korea, but to continue and expand America's military adventure in Korea.

According to an Associated Press dispatch from San Francisco on the 8th, "officials" and "military figures" in Washington have prepared several plans for Eisenhower, including using the remnant troops of the Kuomintang in Taiwan, expanding the use of South Korean troops, and assembling more troops to launch a "new offensive aimed at driving the Communists out of Korea."

Another International News Service dispatch from Washington on the same day corroborates this: as early as before being elected, Eisenhower and his strategists had already discussed this strategy of "driving the Communists out of Korea." International News Service reported Republican Senator Flanders as saying that Flanders had discussed strategies for "ending the war" with Eisenhower before the presidential election. Flanders proposed a plan: "to establish a neutral zone along the Yalu River," and then "to have the United Nations be responsible for the reconstruction of Korea." Eisenhower was "quite interested" in his plan. Flanders also said that Eisenhower had asked him to seek Dulles' opinion. Dulles later wrote to Eisenhower expressing his approval.

People remember that establishing a so-called "buffer zone" or "neutral zone" along the Yalu River, with the United States controlling all of Korea under the banner of the "United Nations," was precisely the atmosphere spread by the American side when MacArthur's invading army launched a large-scale advance towards our northeastern border the winter before last. Its purpose was to cover up MacArthur's conspiracy to occupy all of Korea and then invade our Northeast.

News from American news agencies indicates that while Eisenhower was talking big about his deceptive promises of quickly ending the Korean War on the eve of the election, what he was actually considering was how to complete the task that MacArthur had already failed at. If Eisenhower is still unwilling to accept the lessons MacArthur learned, then he will inevitably suffer an even greater defeat.

    艾森豪威尔及其部下阴谋扩大侵朝战争
    【新华社十六日讯】美国大选刚刚结束，艾森豪威尔对美国选民所作的迅速结束朝鲜战争的许诺言犹在耳，美国通讯社就传出了消息，透露艾森豪威尔及其部下一直在秘密盘算着的却不是觅致朝鲜的和平，而是继续和扩大美国在朝鲜的军事冒险。
    据美联社旧金山八日电透露，华盛顿的“官员”和“军方人士”已经给艾森豪威尔准备好了几个方案，其中包括使用台湾国民党残匪军队，扩大使用南朝鲜军队以及调集更多军队来发动一个“旨在把共产党赶出朝鲜的新攻势”。
    另外一则国际新闻社同一日发自华盛顿的消息不谋而合地证实：早在当选以前，艾森豪威尔就已经和他的策士们计议了这种“把共产党赶出朝鲜”的方策。国际新闻社报道共和党参议员弗兰德斯的话说：弗兰德斯在总统选举前曾和艾森豪威尔商议过“结束战争”的方策。弗兰德斯提出了一个方案，这个方案是：“沿鸭绿江成立一个中立区”，然后“由联合国来负责朝鲜的复兴工作”。艾森豪威尔对他的这个方案“颇感兴趣”。弗兰德斯还说：艾森豪威尔曾要他征求杜勒斯的意见。杜勒斯后来写信给艾森豪威尔表示赞许。
    人们记得：沿鸭绿江成立所谓“缓冲区”或“中立区”而由美国在“联合国”招牌下支配全朝鲜，正是前年冬季麦克阿瑟侵略军大举向我国东北边境推进时美国方面散布出来的空气，其目的在于掩护麦克阿瑟企图占领全朝鲜并进窥我国东北的阴谋。
    美国通讯社透露的消息表明，当艾森豪威尔在大选前夕大谈其迅速停止朝鲜战争的骗人诺言时，他实际在考虑的却是如何能完成麦克阿瑟已经破产了的事业。艾森豪威尔如果还不甘心接受麦克阿瑟所受的教训，那么，他必将遭受更大的失败。
