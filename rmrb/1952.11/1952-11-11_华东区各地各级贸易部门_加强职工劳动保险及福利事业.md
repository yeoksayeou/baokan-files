    Trade Departments at All Levels in East China Strengthen Labor Insurance and Welfare for Employees
    Since the East China Military and Political Committee's Trade Department and the commercial departments, offices, and bureaus of various provinces and cities have launched labor emulation drives, three months have passed. The past phenomenon of neglecting labor insurance and welfare for employees has been gradually corrected, which has played a certain role in promoting the labor emulation movement.
    In the past three months, trade administrative departments at all levels in East China have signed eleven collective labor insurance contracts and similar labor insurance methods and regulations with trade unions to alleviate the various difficulties encountered by employees in production and life. Among the 8,000 employees of East China regional companies alone, 4,250 have enjoyed labor insurance benefits. At the beginning of August this year, the East China Trade Department and the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce successively issued "Measures for Relief of Employees with Living Difficulties," which solved many living difficulties for 15,000 employees of state-owned companies at the regional and municipal levels. The relief measures stipulate that employees facing difficulties such as low wages or excessive family size leading to financial hardship, inability to afford medical treatment for sick relatives, or work stoppage due to illness without medical expenses, can receive temporary relief and long-term subsidies ranging from 22 wage points to 200 wage points at a time. The East China Trade Department and the commercial departments, offices, and bureaus of various provinces and cities have successively absorbed trade unions to participate in the establishment of welfare committees or medical institution management committees and other organizations, vigorously developing welfare undertakings. Up to now, in Shanghai, Nanjing, Hangzhou, Jinan, Qingdao, Wuxi, Hefei, Yangzhou, and other places, six employee hospitals, nine employee medical clinics and outpatient clinics, two employee sanatoriums, twelve employee nurseries, five lactation rooms, and three employee children's schools have been established or are being established. The Central People's Government has allocated 48.75 billion yuan to the state-owned trade departments in the East China region to build employee dormitories. Construction has begun in various places, and it is estimated that more than 4,000 employee dormitories will be built in major, medium, and small cities in East China within the year. These labor insurance and welfare undertakings have solved many specific difficulties for employees, making their labor enthusiasm even higher. In the past three months, trade departments at all levels in East China have achieved remarkable results in the labor emulation drive, and the improvement of labor insurance and welfare has played a significant role.

    华东区各地各级贸易部门
    加强职工劳动保险及福利事业
    华东军政委员会贸易部及各省市人民政府商业厅、处、局自开展劳动竞赛以来，已经三个月了。过去对职工的劳保福利事业不注意的现象已逐步纠正，这对推动劳动竞赛运动起着一定作用。
    三个月来，华东区各地各级贸易行政部门已和工会订立了十一份劳动保险集体合同和类似劳保合同的办法与规定，以减轻职工在生产、生活中所遇到的各种困难。仅华东区级公司八千职工中，即有四千二百五十人享受了劳保待遇。今年八月初华东贸易部及上海市工商局相继颁发了“职工生活困难救济办法”，给区、市两级国营公司一万五千职工解决了不少的生活困难问题。救济办法规定：凡职工发生工资低或家庭人口过多以致生活困难、亲属疾病无力治疗、因病停工无医疗费等困难，都可一次享受二十二个工资分至二百个工资分的临时性的救济和长期性的补助。华东贸易部及各省市商业厅、处、局都先后吸收工会参加，成立了福利委员会或医疗机构管理委员会等组织，大力举办福利事业。至目前为止，在上海、南京、杭州、济南、青岛、无锡、合肥、扬州等地，已举办或正在举办的有职工医院六所、职工医疗所和门诊所九所、职工疗养所两处、职工托儿所十二处，哺乳室五处、职工子弟学校三所。中央人民政府拨给华东全区国营贸易部门四百八十七亿五千万元建筑职工宿舍，各地已开始动用，预计年内将在华东各大、中、小城市建筑四千余间职工宿舍。这些劳保福利事业，给职工解决了许多具体困难，使他们的劳动热情更加提高。三个月来华东区各级贸易部门在劳动竞赛中取得显著成绩，劳保福利事业的改进是起了很大作用的。
