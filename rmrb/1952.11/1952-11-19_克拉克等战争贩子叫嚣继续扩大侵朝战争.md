Title: War-Mongers Like Clark Clamor to Continue Expanding the War of Aggression Against Korea

Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 18th: While Acheson is hypocritically claiming at the United Nations General Assembly that he is willing to end the Korean War, other American military and political figures are shouting in a completely different tone, demanding that the war be continued on a large scale.

Chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, Bradley, publicly promoted the "importance" of the Korean War in Washington, saying: "This is not the time to retreat or slacken." U.S. Deputy Secretary of Defense, Foerst, said: "General Clark and other military leaders doubt that there will be a negotiated peace in Korea in the foreseeable future." On the 15th, the American news agency revealed that Clark had requested an increase of three to four American divisions to "prepare for a new large-scale offensive against the Chinese and North Korean communists." This request is said to have been supported by senior Pentagon figures—including Deputy Secretary of Defense Foerst and members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. These messages make the intention of the American aggressors to continue the Korean War even more obvious.

In order to achieve the goal of continuing the Korean War, the American warmongers have cleverly set several traps. But these traps are only tightening their grip on their own feet, which are deeply mired in the Korean War quagmire.

Wall Street's new agent, Eisenhower, proposed a policy of using the Syngman Rhee puppet army to die for the Americans, in order to deceive the American people and ease their dissatisfaction. When Eisenhower tricked enough votes to go to Georgia to play golf, tens of thousands of American soldiers and Rhee puppet soldiers had already been driven to test this "new policy" of using the Rhee puppet army as a vanguard on a large scale in the barren mountains south of Kimhwa, Korea. But the military reality of the Korean battlefield shows that the results of this experiment are very bad. In October, not only were more than 38,000 Rhee puppet soldiers annihilated, but the number of American troops annihilated also reached an unprecedented 24,000. This means that the Rhee puppet army can be sacrificed in large numbers, but it cannot die in place of the American troops.

Another trap of the American warmongers is to first have the United Nations General Assembly rubber-stamp the "no forced repatriation of prisoners of war" seal used by the United States to close the door to the Korean armistice, and then ask other countries for people and money, dragging them by the nose into more intense war. Now Acheson is using rhetoric to carry out the first step of the plan at the United Nations General Assembly, with the young fellows Eden and Schuman assisting. But this plan is facing increasingly widespread opposition from peace-loving people around the world, and this trap will undoubtedly make the American aggressors increasingly isolated.

In order to deceive world public opinion, Washington is still clinging to the old trap of "no forced repatriation of prisoners of war." The more they know that adhering to this absurd proposition will inevitably lead to the collapse of the armistice negotiations, the more they adhere to this proposition. At the United Nations General Assembly, American representatives have been unable to defend their claims that completely violate the Geneva Conventions, and have had to bring out the even more absurd old tune of prisoners of war requesting "asylum." They want the world to believe that prisoners of war would rather never see their wives and children for the rest of their lives than yearn for masters of typical American "asylums" like Dodd and Bonner.

The farce of "voluntary repatriation" has already led to the United States' unprecedented moral bankruptcy. The result of insisting on this farce will cause the American aggressors to be despised by more people.

Those here point out that in the forty days since the U.S. side suspended the meeting, developments have increasingly clearly demonstrated the U.S. government's determination not to have an armistice, but at the same time, it has become increasingly clear that the future for the American aggressors to continue the Korean War is extremely unfavorable. For other countries in the United Nations, the war clamor of Clark and his ilk is a dangerous signal; if they support the U.S. government's unreasonable proposition of "no forced repatriation of prisoners of war," then they will be paving the way for the United States to expand the Korean War.

### 克拉克等战争贩子叫嚣继续扩大侵朝战争

    克拉克等战争贩子叫嚣继续扩大侵朝战争
    【新华社开城十八日电】当艾奇逊在联合国大会上假惺惺地声称愿意结束朝鲜战争的时候，美国的其他军政要人却在用完全不同的腔调高喊着要继续大规模进行战争。
    美国参谋长联席会议主席布莱德雷在华盛顿公开宣扬朝鲜战争的“重要”，他说：“这不是撤退或松劲的时候。”美国国防部副部长浮斯特说：“克拉克将军及其他军事领袖都怀疑在可以预见的将来朝鲜会有一个谈判而成的和平。”十五日，美国通讯社更透露克拉克要求增加美军三到四个师，以“准备一次新的对中国与北朝鲜共军的大举进攻”。这个要求据说已得到五角大楼的高级人物——包括国防部副部长浮斯特和参谋长联席会议人员——的支持。这些消息使美国侵略者继续朝鲜战争的意图更加明显了。
    为了达到继续朝鲜战争的目的，美国战争贩子们曾自作聪明地设下了几重圈套。但是这些圈套只是越来越紧地套住了他们自己深陷在朝鲜战争泥淖中的双脚。
    华尔街的新代理人艾森豪威尔提出了用李承晚伪军给美国人替死的政策，来欺骗美国人民，缓和他们的不满。当艾森豪威尔骗得了足够的选票，到佐治亚州去打高尔夫球的时候，成万的美国士兵和李伪军士兵，已被驱使着在朝鲜金化以南的一片荒山中大规模地试验这种用李伪军挡头阵的“新政策”。但是朝鲜战场的军事现实说明了这种试验结果十分不妙。在十月份，不但李伪军被歼灭了三万八千多人，美军被歼的数字也空前地达到了二万四千多人。这就是说，李伪军可以大批殉葬，但不能给美军替死。
    美国战争贩子的另一个圈套，是首先要联合国大会在美国用来封闭朝鲜停战之门的“不强迫遣返战俘”的封条上盖一个橡皮图章，然后向其它国家要人要钱，把它们牵着鼻子拖进更炽烈的战火中去。现在艾奇逊正在联合国大会上花言巧语地进行第一步活动，小伙计艾登和舒曼在一旁帮腔。但是这一计划正遭受到全世界爱好和平人民越来越普遍的反对，这个圈套无疑将使美国侵略者自己日益趋于孤立。
    为了蒙蔽世界舆论，华盛顿仍在坚持“不强迫遣返战俘”的老圈套。他们越是知道坚持这个荒谬主张将不可避免地导致停战谈判的崩溃，他们就越是坚持这个主张。在联合国大会上，美国代表们已无法为他们完全违反日内瓦公约的主张辩护，只好又搬出更荒唐的所谓战俘要求“避难所”的老调。他们要全世界相信战俘宁愿一生不见妻子儿女，而留恋着杜德、波纳这样典型的美国“避难所”主人。
    “自愿遣返”的丑剧，早已招致了美国道义上的空前破产。坚持这场丑剧的结果，将使美国侵略者遭到更多人的唾弃。
    此间人士指出：自美方中断会议以来的四十天中，事态的发展越加明显地证明美国政府决心不要停战，但同时也越加清楚地显示出美国侵略者继续朝鲜战争的极不美妙的前途。对于联合国中的其他国家来说，克拉克之流的战争叫嚣是一个危险的信号；如果它们支持美国政府的“不强迫遣返战俘”的无理主张，那末它们就是替美国扩大朝鲜战争开辟了道路。
