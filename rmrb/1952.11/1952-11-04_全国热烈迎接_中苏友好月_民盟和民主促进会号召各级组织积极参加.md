Xinhua News Agency, 3rd: People in cities across the country are enthusiastically and intensely preparing for the upcoming "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month." Many cities are already displaying a joyous festive atmosphere. In Chongqing, a propaganda team of over 10,000 people is about to begin its activities, and the windows of shops in the city center are decorated with various pictures related to the Soviet Union. On the streets of Dihua, propaganda vehicles organized by the Xinjiang Office of the China Film Corporation and various cinemas, as well as buses plastered with celebratory slogans, are running back and forth; citizen Yangko teams and ethnic song and dance troupes of Uyghur and Kazakh women are also actively publicizing the Soviet Union's sincere and selfless assistance to the Chinese people and distributing promotional materials. Wang Hanguo, a farmer representative from Guangdong Province who has visited the Soviet Union, is enthusiastically giving reports to the citizens of Guangzhou about his visit. Pre-sale ticket purchases for Soviet films are very enthusiastic in major and medium-sized cities, with over 150,000 people registered in Kunming, a city with a population of over 300,000.

Workers in various regions are even more enthusiastically launching movements to learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and engaging in production increase competitions. Many production teams at Chongqing Steel Plant No. 101 held symposiums to recall the help Soviet experts provided to the plant in terms of production technology. After the meetings, the steelmaking workshop launched a production competition to learn the Soviet "fast steelmaking method," which reduced the average daily smelting time per furnace by three hours and set a new record. Workers in the riveting workshop also learned the Soviet "two-handed electric welding method," which doubled the production speed. Workers and cadres of the Sino-Soviet Petroleum Joint-Stock Company in Xinjiang Province are widely learning Russian and launching a movement to learn production technology from Soviet experts. The Xi'an City Federation of Trade Unions is organizing labor models with significant achievements in learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union to perform demonstrations in order to promote the advanced production experience of the Soviet Union. In order to express their gratitude to Soviet experts, the workers of Dihua not only took practical action by launching production competitions to welcome the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month" but also wrote letters to Soviet experts to express their heartfelt love.

People everywhere are eagerly looking forward to the arrival of the Soviet delegation of art and science workers and the Soviet Army Red Flag Song and Dance Ensemble. In many cities, people are actively inquiring with local Sino-Soviet Friendship Associations about news of the Soviet representatives. The train station in Wuhan has been decorated. The Tianjin Locomotive Section of the Tianjin Railway Sub-bureau has also specially prepared two locomotives for our dear Soviet friends, with the paint freshly applied and looking very beautiful. Workers of various ethnic groups in Dihua have organized four waist drum teams and two song and dance troupes, and are rehearsing wonderful ethnic programs, preparing to sing and dance for Soviet friends during the Sino-Soviet friendship activities.

[This newspaper reported] According to Xinhua News Agency: The China Democratic League and the China Association for Promoting Democracy have respectively called on organizations at all levels to actively mobilize all members and associates to participate in the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month" movement.

The headquarters of the China Democratic League convened a meeting of the Central Standing Committee on November 3rd. The meeting passed instructions regarding the holding of "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month," to be issued to organizations at all levels of the league. The meeting also decided to establish a "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month" office at the headquarters of the Democratic League and set out a work plan to promote the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month." In its instructions to organizations at all levels, the Democratic League first required that all organizations must attach importance to the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month" movement and regard this movement as an important political task for the current period. The instructions then required all members to deeply appreciate the significance of Sino-Soviet friendship and the truth of "leaning to one side" during this period, to intensify the study of the Soviet Union's experience in national construction, experience in scientific and technological work, experience in literary, artistic, cultural, and educational work, and the great revolutionary theories of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, in order to further implement the self-education and self-transformation of Chinese intellectuals. The instructions also required organizations at all levels to cooperate with local Sino-Soviet Friendship Associations and local consultation committees, seize the time to mobilize members and the masses, actively organize and participate in various celebrations, and warmly receive Soviet representatives and experts. During this period, they should also widely contact people in cultural and educational circles and hold various symposiums and lectures.

The China Association for Promoting Democracy issued a notice to organizations at all levels, requiring local branches to educate members and the masses they are connected with to further recognize the international significance of the October Revolution and the great role the Soviet Union plays in safeguarding world peace, to understand from concrete facts that Sino-Soviet friendship is becoming more and more consolidated and developed, and that the power of the Sino-Soviet alliance is invincible in the world. They were also asked to introduce the great construction achievements of the Soviet Union and set off a wave of further learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union in politics, economics, culture, science, and other fields. The notice also required that: Where conditions permit, small-scale celebrations, reports, and symposiums should be held, and the content should be combined with the needs of members and the masses. In addition to general publicity, more attention should be paid to introducing advanced Soviet teaching experience to primary and secondary school teachers, and talking about their personal experience of the selfless assistance the Soviet Union has given us in educational reform. In addition, they can also be organized to write articles for publication in association journals or other newspapers and magazines, and to study the documents and reports of "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month," as well as the documents of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference and the 19th Congress of the CPSU. Other activities such as organizing them to watch Soviet films, listen to "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month" radio programs, and hold Soviet photo exhibitions can all be carried out in coordination with the unified arrangements of local authorities.
