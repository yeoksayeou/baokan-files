Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, November 13th: Around 15:40 on November 8th, the U.S. side once again violated the agreement by dispatching four military aircraft to intrude into the airspace over the Panmunjom conference area. During the investigation by security officers from both sides, three of our military police officers who witnessed the incident unanimously confirmed that the U.S. aircraft intruded into the conference area and bombed our positions near the conference area; one of them even clearly identified the markings of the U.S. aircraft with binoculars. However, the other party, disregarding the facts, tried its best to deny it. This irresponsible attitude of the U.S. side shows that they are increasingly unwilling to abide by the conference area agreement and maintain order in the conference area.

    美机又破坏协议侵入会场区
    【新华社开城十三日电】十一月八日十五时四十分左右，美方又一次破坏协议，派遣军用飞机四架侵入板门店会场区上空。在双方安全军官进行调查时，目击这一事件的我方军事警察三人，一致证实美机侵越会场区向会场区附近我方阵地进行轰炸；其中一人并曾用望远镜清楚辨明美机标志。但是对方仍不顾事实，极力企图抵赖。美方这种不负责任的态度，显示他们已经愈来愈无意遵守会场区协议和维持会场区的秩序。
