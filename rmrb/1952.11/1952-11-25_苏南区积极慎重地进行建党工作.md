    South Jiangsu Region Actively and Cautiously Carries Out Party Building Work
    Zhou Qingyu

    Editor's Note: The party building work in the South Jiangsu region is generally good in terms of organizing strength, cultivating objects, and adhering to standards. In particular, the party's leading organs are good at grasping the characteristics of the new areas, appropriately adopting the training class method under the condition of full preparation; at the same time, according to the changes in the subjective and objective conditions of party building, they timely put forward new approaches, effectively ensuring the implementation of the active and prudent party building policy. This experience can be used for reference in various places.

    I

    The party building work in the South Jiangsu region is being carried out in strict accordance with the active yet prudent policy put forward by the Party Central Committee. More than 10,000 new party members have been admitted in the first phase.

    South Jiangsu was liberated in 1949, and the party's foundation was very weak. A large part of the villages had not established party organizations, and the organizational structure of most district committees was not substantial enough. In the cities, there were also many factories that had not established party organizations. On the other hand, in the past three years, more than 200,000 activists have emerged from various mass movements, many of whom are eager to join the party; at the same time, many factory and rural work cadres have also reflected: the task of economic construction is heavy, and we must establish strong fortresses in factories and rural areas to lead the great production and construction work. These situations require the party in South Jiangsu to actively and prudently carry out party building work in accordance with the policy put forward by the Party Central Committee.

    From August of last year to June of this year, the cities and counties of South Jiangsu carried out the following preparatory work for party building: (1) Universally trained party building backbones. A total of 602 party building backbones were directly trained by the South Jiangsu District Party Committee, some of whom were teachers of the county's party building training classes, and some were party organizers; 3,540 party building backbones were trained by the local party committees. (2) Universally and extensively cultivated party building objects, and carried out systematic education on communism and the Communist Party. According to incomplete statistics, about 20,000 people in the region received this education. (3) Conducted typical experiments under leadership. The South Jiangsu District Party Committee directly led five typical experimental points. The Minister of Organization personally served as a party class teacher in a typical village, and Secretary Chen Pixian personally grasped the work of the typical village. The typical examples of the counties were also mostly led by the organization minister of the county party committee. These active measures laid a good political, ideological, and organizational foundation for party building work.

    In order to concentrate leadership, the South Jiangsu District Party Committee decided to adopt the method of building the party through party building training classes: all development objects who basically meet the conditions for joining the party, after strict review by the district committee and approval by the county committee, are concentrated in the party building training class to receive education on communism, the Communist Party, and the eight conditions for the standards of Communist Party members. This can continue to improve their communist consciousness and further conduct review work. Then, those who meet the standards of party members are individually admitted into the party in accordance with the procedures for joining the party stipulated by the Central Committee. This not only solves the difficulty of insufficient subjective strength, but also achieves strict control and guarantees the quality of party members.

    In order to do a good job in the party building work of the party building training classes, the South Jiangsu District Party Committee utilized and organized all possible forces: first, the propaganda departments and organization departments of the county and city party committees, in addition to retaining a small number of cadres to adhere to daily work, invested most of their cadres in party building work; the task of the district party committees was to combine with the central work to sort, register, and review the activists. Second, select and appoint a sufficient number of fixed organizers, and stipulate that all fixed organizers should be temporarily transferred from their original positions to specialize in the work of developing the party. Other party members who meet the conditions of organizers and can do party building work are designated by the district party committee as temporary organizers, and assume a certain amount of party development work in conjunction with their own work. According to current statistics, there are already more than 1,500 fixed organizers and temporary organizers in the South Jiangsu region. Third, organize party building work teams to focus on conducting party building work in a small number of larger factories. Fourth, each county draws six or seven serving cadres to study party building work experience at the party school of the South Jiangsu District Party Committee.

    II

    In August of this year, all counties in South Jiangsu comprehensively launched party building work. At that time, each system wanted to use the slack farming season to train cadres in their own departments: the Women's Federation wanted to run women's training classes, the Youth League wanted to train youth work cadres, the Farmers' Work Committee wanted to train mutual aid team backbones, and the militia headquarters and cooperatives all wanted to transfer a group of cadres for training. Different work teams often came to the factory with different tasks and requirements: the trade union department engaged in democratic reform and working hours reform, the public security bureau engaged in economic security, and the culture and education department engaged in rapid literacy. This led to the phenomenon of competing for cadres and time. In order to coordinate and echo each other in various tasks, the South Jiangsu District Party Committee proposed the policy of unifying thinking, unifying leadership, overcoming departmentalism, and establishing the concept of party building. It is stipulated that all party development objects must first be transferred to the party building training class to study, and on this premise, appropriately take care of the training of various business cadres. In the cities, it is clearly stipulated that on the premise of doing a good job in the central work, the division of labor and responsibility should be carried out according to actual needs to complete the party building work and the work of various departments.

    Under the guidance of unified thinking, the party building training classes in various counties, in addition to carrying out education on communism, the Communist Party, and the eight conditions for the standards of Communist Party members, also conducted necessary business education at the end of the training class. For example, education on branch work, democratic construction of political power, mutual aid and cooperation, marriage law, and propaganda network. The leadership of various mass organizations also helped the party organization to investigate development objects. In this way, mutual coordination and mutual echo were achieved. In particular, party building education played a decisive role in consolidating various organizations. Regarding the issue of combining urban party building work with central work, more mature experience has been gained in Wuxi, Changshu, and other cities. Especially in Changshu City, under unified leadership, combined with the central work of democratic reform, various forces were naturally attracted to democratic reform and party building work. Lei Tao, a cadre of the Public Security Bureau, was originally sent to the factory to establish a public security protection committee and develop a picket team. When he first arrived at the factory, he saw that everyone was very busy and did not know where to start. Later, under the unified leadership of the South Jiangsu District Party Committee work team branch, he not only completed his work tasks, but also did party building work.

    There were also individual counties where party building work lacked unified leadership, and even the party's organizational work and propaganda work could not be carried out in a unified manner. For example, the organization minister and propaganda minister of Jiangning County Committee did not move in the same direction. The students of the party building training class said: "Minister Song wants education, and Minister Chen wants development." This phenomenon will only cause losses to party building work. Due to the timely inspection and rapid correction by the South Jiangsu District Party Committee, party building work was able to develop smoothly.

    III

    The party building education work in the South Jiangsu region was carried out in a prepared, planned, and led manner. In the past year, almost all the strength of the Education Department of the Propaganda Department of the South Jiangsu District Party Committee has been put into party building education work. During the typical party building experiment last year, Chen Pixian, Secretary of the South Jiangsu District Party Committee, and many cadres of the Propaganda Department and Organization Department had to study the experimental work of typical villages and typical factories almost every week. In November last year, the South Jiangsu District Party Committee specifically convened a party building education work conference to conduct a preliminary inspection of the education work of the typical experiment; and discussed the issue of education methods regarding communism and the Communist Party. Before the opening of the first phase of the party building training class, the South Jiangsu District Party Committee clearly put forward the following points that should be paid attention to when conducting education on communism and the Communist Party: (1) Focus on positive explanations, and combine them with discussions and necessary ideological examinations to achieve the purpose of helping digestion; (2) Focus on establishing the standards of party members, and pay attention to linking with reality and criticizing some representative confused thoughts; (3) Proceed from reality, focus on the ideological situation of the students, and connect with the current movement and central work.

    In the rural areas, South Jiangsu has the following experience on how party building education should be linked to ideological reality: First, when conducting education on the standards of Communist Party members, attention should be paid to the education of two roads, and the direction of agricultural production development should be clearly pointed out. Ideologically establish that Communist Party members should not take the road of rich peasants who become rich through exploitation, but should take the road of organizing mutual assistance and cooperation, gradually moving from small-scale production to collectivized large-scale production. And on the basis of solving this fundamental ideological problem, incidentally solve other problems, such as criticizing and overcoming the selfish and conservative backward thinking of peasants, establishing the communist thought of selfless collectivism, and criticizing and overcoming the work style of coercion and command, establishing the work methods and style of the mass line.

    The second important experience is that education work and organizational work must be closely linked and must not be mechanically separated. That is to say, the entire process of education work is also the process of organizational review. Therefore, when party building objects first arrive at the training class, they should be classified and sorted according to existing materials and specific circumstances for a preliminary review. A further review will be conducted when conducting education on the standards of party members. If it is believed that the party building training class is simply handling the formalities for joining the party and neglecting ideological education; or simply emphasizing education and neglecting in-depth investigation, it will cause the deviation of impure organization and reduced standards.

    IV

    The South Jiangsu District Party Committee pays attention to strictly controlling the work of admitting new party members. Originally, many of the objects that the district party committees expected to develop could not join the party after education and review. A total of 10,193 people were trained in the first phase of the rural party building training class, of which only 5,901 were admitted as new party members, accounting for just over one-half of the number of trainees. Many county party building training classes changed their original development plans after education and review: for example, the Danyang County Party Committee originally planned to develop 80% in the party building training class, but in the process of education and review, it was found that the district committee's review of the transferred trainees was extremely rough (which of course also reflected the county committee's rough review), so it had to reduce the original plan to 26-27%. This fact: on the one hand, it reflects that the selection of activists by some district committees is rough and not careful; but on the other hand, it reflects that the counties are generally serious and prudent in the work of admitting new party members. According to the feedback from several county and district party committees such as Wuxi, Jiangyin, and Wujin, the new party members have very high enthusiasm for work after returning. The new party members in the factories ask the branch for work, and so do the new party members in the rural areas. The masses said that they have changed: their attitude towards the masses has become kinder, and their work enthusiasm has increased.

    The key to the success of this party building work in the South Jiangsu region lies in their ability to correctly implement the Party Central Committee's active and prudent party building policy of preparation, planning, and leadership. When implementing such a policy, the South Jiangsu District Party Committee also promptly grasped the main links of the current work. In the party building preparation period, it grasped the link of "careful planning and organizing forces"; when party building work was fully launched, it grasped the link of "unifying thinking and unifying leadership"; when carrying out the work of admitting new party members, it grasped the link of "adhering to standards and strict procedures"; and in the entire party building work process, it also paid attention to the link of "intensifying inspection and summarizing experience," and combined the party's propaganda work and organizational work.

    V

    After the first phase of party building, party organizations have been established in most areas of South Jiangsu, and the subjective strength of party building has been greatly enhanced; on the other hand, the most outstanding of the activists who have emerged from the various movements in factories, rural areas, and organs have been largely or partially admitted into the party. This reflects that the subjective and objective conditions of party building in the South Jiangsu region have undergone significant changes. However, some comrades in individual counties and districts cannot see this change, and are still satisfied with the party building method of training classes, believing that "training class party building is fast and good," so the branches, which originally had the strength to undertake party building work, still rely on training classes to carry out development work.

    In order to effectively implement the Party Central Committee's active and prudent party building policy, ensure the quality of the party, and adhere to the standards of party members, after the first batch of new party members were developed, the South Jiangsu District Party Committee required party committees at all levels to earnestly check the quality of the new party members, and educate cadres to deeply understand the spirit of the Central Committee on party building through checking and summarizing work. The District Party Committee decided that in the future, the work of admitting new party members will generally not be carried out in party building training classes, because training class party building is a special party building method under special circumstances, not the only constant and unchanging method. That is to say, in the new area, when the objective conditions for party building are fully mature, but the original party foundation is very weak, there are few party building backbones, and the leadership lacks party building experience, it is entirely necessary to appropriately adopt the training class method to carry out party building, concentrate forces to conduct education, review, and individually develop. But in another situation, that is, in most areas, the party organization has been established, and the subjective strength of party building has been strengthened, party building work should be carried out by relying on the party's grass-roots organizations in the current production movement. Because carrying out party development work through the current movement and struggle is the fundamental principle of our party's party building. And training classes generally only undertake the task of educating, improving, and reviewing and investigating, and submit the assessment results to the local branch for reference. Only some units without party branches and some temporary branches that are not yet capable of admitting new party members can handle the formalities for admitting new party members through party building training classes.

    苏南区积极慎重地进行建党工作
    周擎宇
    编者按：苏南区的建党工作，在组织力量、培养对象、坚持标准等方面，一般是比较好的。特别是党的领导机关善于掌握新区特点，在充分准备的条件下，适当地采用训练班的方式；同时，按照建党的主观与客观条件的变化，及时地提出新的做法，有效地保证了积极慎重的建党方针的贯彻。这个经验可供各地参考。
    一
    苏南区的建党工作是切实按照党中央所提出的积极而又慎重的方针进行的。第一期已接收新党员一万多名。
    苏南是一九四九年解放的，党的基础很弱，农村尚有大部分乡没有建立党的组织，大部分的区委组织机构也不够充实。在城市，也有很多工厂没有建立党的组织。而在另一方面，三年来从各种群众运动中涌现出二十多万积极分子，其中有不少的人迫切要求入党；同时，许多工厂、农村的工作干部也纷纷反映：经济建设的任务大，必须在工厂农村中建立起坚强的堡垒，领导伟大的生产建设工作。这些情况要求苏南的党：必须按照党中央所提出的方针，积极而又慎重地进行建党工作。
    苏南各市、县就在去年八月至今年六月这一期间，进行了下列的建党准备工作：（一）普遍训练建党骨干。由苏南区党委直接训练的建党骨干共六百零二人，其中一部分是县的建党训练班的教员，一部分是党的组织员；由各地委训练的建党骨干有三千五百四十人。（二）普遍大量地培养建党对象，进行系统的共产主义和共产党的教育。据不完全统计，全区受到这种教育的约有两万人左右。（三）有领导地进行典型试验。苏南区党委直接领导了五个典型试验点，组织部长亲自到典型乡担任党课教员，书记陈丕显亲自掌握典型乡的工作。各县的典型也多由县委的组织部长领导。这些积极措施，为建党工作打下了政治上、思想上、组织上的良好基础。
    为了集中领导，苏南区党委决定采用建党训练班建党的方式：凡基本上具备入党条件的发展对象，经过区委的严格审查和县委的批准，集中到建党训练班来受一次共产主义、共产党和共产党员标准的八项条件的教育。这样可以继续提高他们的共产主义的觉悟，并进一步进行审查工作。然后将其中具备了党员标准的人，按照中央所规定的入党手续，个别接收入党。这不但解决了主观力量不足的困难，而且做到了严格控制，保证了党员的质量。
    为了做好建党训练班的建党工作，苏南区党委运用与组织了各方面可能运用的力量：首先各县、市委宣传部、组织部除留少数干部坚持日常工作外，将大部分干部投入建党工作；各区委的任务则是结合中心工作对积极分子进行排队、登记、审查工作。其次，选择、委任足够数量的固定组织员，并规定所有固定组织员一律暂时调离原工作岗位，专作发展党的工作。其他具备组织员条件而又可能做建党工作的党员，则由区党委指定为临时组织员，结合本身工作，担负一定的发展党的工作。按目前统计，苏南全区已有固定组织员和临时组织员一千五百余人。第三、组织建党工作队，有重点地到少数较大的工厂进行建党工作。第四、每县抽调六、七个在职干部到苏南区党委党校学习建党工作经验。
    二
    今年八月苏南各县全面开展了建党工作。当时，各个系统都要利用农闲期间训练本部门的干部：妇联要开办妇女训练班，青年团要训练青年工作干部，农民工作委员会要训练互助组的骨干，民兵总队部、合作社都想抽调一批干部进行训练。常常有不同的工作组带着不同的任务和要求到工厂工作：工会部门搞民主改革和工时改革，公安局搞经济保卫，文教部门搞速成识字。这就发生了争干部、争时间的现象。为使各项工作互相配合、互相呼应，苏南区党委提出了统一思想、统一领导，克服本位主义，树立建党观念的方针。规定凡是党的发展对象必须首先抽调到建党训练班学习，并在这样的前提下，适当地照顾各种业务干部的训练。在城市，则明确规定在做好中心工作的前提下，按照实际需要分工负责，来完成建党工作和各部门工作。
    在统一思想的指导下，各县建党训练班除了进行共产主义、共产党和共产党员标准的八项条件的教育外，并在训练班的结束期间进行了必要的业务教育。例如关于支部工作、民主建政、互助合作、婚姻法、宣传网等教育。各群众团体的领导方面也帮助党的组织考察发展对象。这样，便做到了互相配合，互相呼应，特别是建党的教育对于巩固各种组织，起了决定性的作用。关于城市建党工作与中心工作结合进行问题，在无锡、常熟等市都有较成熟的经验。特别是常熟市，在统一领导之下，结合民主改革这一中心工作，很自然地把各种力量吸引到民主改革和建党工作中来。公安局干部雷陶本来是到工厂建立治安保卫委员会和发展纠察队工作的，刚到厂里，看到大家很忙，自己不知道从何着手。后来在苏南区党委工作队支部的统一领导下，他既完成了自己的工作任务，又作了建党工作。
    也有个别县的建党工作由于缺乏统一领导，连党的组织工作与宣传工作也不能统一进行。例如：江宁县委的组织部长和宣传部长步调就不一致，建党训练班的学员说：“宋部长要教育、陈部长要发展”。这种现象只会使建党工作遭受损失。由于苏南区党委的及时检查和迅速纠正，使建党工作得以顺利地发展。
    三
    苏南区的建党教育工作是有准备、有计划、有领导地进行的。一年来苏南区党委宣传部教育处的力量几乎全部放在建党教育工作上。在去年建党典型试验期间，苏南区党委书记陈丕显和宣传部组织部的好多干部差不多每周要研究一次典型乡和典型厂的试验工作。去年十一月间苏南区党委曾专门召开了一次建党教育工作会议，对典型试验的教育工作做了初步的检查；并讨论了关于共产主义和共产党的教育方法问题。在第一期建党训练班开办以前，苏南区党委即明确提出进行共产主义和共产党教育时应注意以下几点：（一）要以正面讲解为主，并结合讨论和进行必要的思想检查，以达到帮助消化的目的；（二）要着重树立党员标准，并注意联系实际和批评一些带有代表性的糊涂思想；（三）从实际出发，针对学员思想情况，并联系当前运动和中心工作。
    在农村，关于建党教育应如何联系思想实际的问题，苏南区有如下的体验：第一，在进行共产党员标准的教育时，要注意两条道路的教育，要明确指出农业生产的发展方向，从思想上确立共产党员不应走剥削致富的富农道路，而应走组织起来互助合作，由小生产逐步走向集体化的大生产的道路。并在解决这一根本思想问题的基础上，附带解决其他问题，如批判与克服农民的自私自利的保守落后思想，确立大公无私的集体主义的共产主义思想，批判和克服强迫命令的工作作风，确立群众路线的工作方法和作风。
    第二个重要体验，就是教育工作和组织工作必须密切联系，不容机械分离。这就是说，整个教育工作的过程也就是组织审查的过程。因此，建党对象初到训练班时，就应该根据已有的材料，按照具体情况进行分类排队，作一次初步审查。在进行党员标准的教育时再作进一步审查。如果认为建党训练班只是单纯地办理入党手续而忽视思想教育；或者单纯地强调教育而忽视深入考察，都会造成组织不纯和降低标准的偏向。
    四
    苏南区党委对接收新党员的工作是注意严格控制的。原来各区委预计可以发展的对象，经教育审查结果，就有不少人不能入党。农村第一期建党训练班共训练一万零一百九十三人，其中接收为新党员的仅五千九百零一人，占受训人数的二分之一强。许多县的建党训练班在教育审查以后，改变了原定发展计划：如丹阳县委原拟在建党训练班中发展百分之八十，但在教育审查过程中发现区委对于调训对象的审查工作极其粗糙（当然也反映了县委审查粗糙），只好将原计划降低到百分之二十六、七。这一事实：一方面反映了某些区委对积极分子的选拔粗糙不细致；但另方面，反映了各县在接收新党员的工作上一般还是严肃慎重的。据无锡、江阴、武进等几个县委、区委反映，新党员回去以后工作积极性很高，工厂里的新党员向支部要工作，农村的新党员也是如此。群众都说他们变了：对群众的态度和善了，工作的劲头大了。
    苏南区这次建党工作所以获得这样的成绩，关键在于他们能够正确地执行了党中央的有准备、有计划、有领导的积极而慎重的建党方针。在贯彻执行这样的方针时，苏南区党委又及时地抓住了当前工作的主要环节。在建党准备时期抓住了“精密计划、组织力量”的环节；在建党工作全面展开时掌握了“统一思想、统一领导”的环节；在进行接收新党员工作时掌握了“坚持标准、严格手续”的环节；在整个建党工作过程中又注意了“加紧检查、总结经验”的环节，并把党的宣传工作和组织工作结合起来。
    五
    经过第一期建党，苏南多数地区已经建立了党的组织，建党的主观力量已经大大增强；而另一方面，在工厂、农村、机关历次运动中所涌现出的积极分子，其中最优秀的已大部或部分地被接收入党。这反映了苏南区建党的主客观情况已经有了显著的变化。可是，有个别县、区的同志却看不到这种变化，依然满足于训练班建党方式，认为“训练班建党又快又好”，因而本来有力量担负建党工作的支部，仍依赖训练班来进行发展工作。
    为了有效地贯彻党中央积极慎重的建党方针，保证党的质量，坚持党员标准，在第一批发展新党员后，苏南区党委要求各级党委认真地检查新党员的质量，通过检查总结工作，教育干部深刻领会中央的建党精神。区党委决定今后接收新党员工作，一般地不在建党训练班进行，因为训练班建党是在一种特殊情况下的一种特殊的建党方式，不是唯一的经常不变的方式。这就是说，在新区建党客观条件已完全成熟，但是原有党的基础很弱，建党骨干又少，领导上又缺乏建党经验的情况下，适当地采用训练班方式进行建党，集中力量进行教育、审查并个别发展，这是完全必要的。但在另一种情况下，即在多数地区党的组织已经建立，建党的主观力量已经加强的情况下，建党工作则应在当前的生产运动中依靠党的基层组织来进行。因为通过当前的运动和斗争进行党的发展工作是我党建党的根本原则。而训练班一般地只担负起教育提高和审查考察的任务，并将考核结果交当地支部参考。只有某些没有党的支部的单位和某些尚无力接收新党员的临时支部，可由建党训练班办理接收新党员的手续。
