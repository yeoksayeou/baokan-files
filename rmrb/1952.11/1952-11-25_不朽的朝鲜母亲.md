    The Immortal Korean Mother
    By Xie Zhilin, Xinhua News Agency Correspondent

    On a hillside about ten miles southwest of Unsan City in northern Korea, there is a grave where an immortal Korean mother is buried. Next to the grave are five tombs of Volunteer Army martyrs who sacrificed their lives in the First Campaign. When people come to these graves, they silently and respectfully remember the martyrs who gloriously sacrificed in the struggle against the common enemy of China and Korea—the American aggressors—and this immortal Korean mother.

    Two years ago, Volunteer Army soldiers personally buried this immortal Korean mother here. At that time, the troops advanced rapidly south, and there was no time to tell the Korean people the details of this matter. It was not until last spring, when soldiers of a certain unit of the Volunteer Army came to the tomb for a solemn memorial ceremony, that the local people learned from a soldier named Li Zhihuang about the moving deeds of this immortal Korean mother during her lifetime.

    This immortal Korean mother worked in a textile factory in Pyongyang before the war. Her husband joined the People's Army after the outbreak of the war. At that time, she was already pregnant. A few days before the enemy occupied Pyongyang, she fled with her seven-year-old child, Jin Yongzhu. On October 26, 1950, the mother and son came to the Unsan area and encountered the Volunteer Army's outpost guard on a mountain ridge. At that time, she was about to give birth, so the Volunteer Army soldiers sent her and her child out of the line of fire. The next day, she gave birth to a child under the care of the Volunteer Army. Her postpartum body was still considered healthy, but the newborn infant died due to the hardships of the war. In the intervals of intense fighting, the Volunteer Army soldiers took turns to bring her water and food, and also sent her and her child cotton military uniforms to keep them warm. This Korean mother was so moved by the sincere care of the Volunteer Army soldiers that she shed tears.

    A few days later, she noticed that the soldier Li Zhihuang, who often came to take care of her, was gone, and the other soldiers were also saddened by something. She repeatedly asked the soldiers and learned that Li Zhihuang had not returned from a reconnaissance mission and his whereabouts were still unknown. At this time, her body had gradually recovered, and she immediately asked to go behind enemy lines to find out about Li Zhihuang's whereabouts. She repeatedly said to a regimental commander of the Volunteer Army: "You are willing to shed blood and sacrifice for the sake of aiding our motherland, and I should do something for my motherland even more. Please allow me to fight the enemy for my motherland!"

    Thus, this Korean mother took her seven-year-old child and a hand grenade hidden in her arms and headed straight for the enemy-occupied area. As a result of her inquiries everywhere, she finally learned about Li Zhihuang's whereabouts from the Korean elderly, women, and children who had not had time to evacuate: Li Zhihuang had unfortunately fallen into the hands of the enemy during reconnaissance and was imprisoned in a house in a mountain gully. So she immediately tried to rescue this soldier. She found a sickle for her child and asked the child to give the sickle to the Volunteer Army uncle when she was entangled with the enemy. She instructed the child to escape with Li Zhihuang from the back hillside and throw a small stone at her as a signal. Her last words to the child were: "As for me... when you hear the hand grenade explode, don't expect your mother anymore. Don't be sad, the Volunteer Army uncles will take care of you, and our General Kim Il-sung will raise you to adulthood, but you must firmly remember the hatred for the enemy!" The child silently agreed, and he followed his mother to the place where Li Zhihuang was imprisoned.

    In a mountain gully, there were four houses. The enemy had set up a temporary prison here, and five American soldiers were guarding it. The two American soldiers outside the house saw a middle-aged woman coming with a child and indecently went up to stop her. She took the opportunity to curse loudly, which alarmed the other three American soldiers in the house. When the enemy was entangled by her, she gave the child a hint. At this time, the child cleverly slipped to the house and told Li Zhihuang with gestures that he was here to rescue him. He cut the rope binding Li Zhihuang with a sickle. Li Zhihuang immediately took the sickle and quietly walked out of the back door with the child. At this time, the child still heard his mother's voice arguing with the enemy, so he threw a stone at his mother, telling her that he and Li Zhihuang had safely escaped. Soon the hand grenade exploded, and this great Korean mother gloriously sacrificed herself for the motherland while killing the enemy soldiers.

    Li Zhihuang returned to the troops and reported the whole process to everyone. The regimental commander and the soldiers had infinite respect and mourning for this heroic mother. After the victory of the Unsan battle, they buried the remains of this immortal Korean mother and the martyrs of the Volunteer Army together. The orphan Jin Yongzhu was also transferred to the Korean government's Aiyu Hospital under the care of the Volunteer Army soldiers.

    Now, on the tomb of this heroic Korean mother, there are evergreen pine and cypress trees growing. The achievements she made in the struggle against the common enemy of the Chinese and Korean people—the American aggressors—will be immortal.

    不朽的朝鲜母亲
    新华社记者  谢芝麟
    在朝鲜北部云山城西南十多里的山坡上，有一个安葬着一位不朽的朝鲜母亲的坟墓。在墓的旁边，还有五个在第一次战役中牺牲的志愿军烈士的坟墓。人们走到这些坟的旁边，都用最崇敬的心情默念在反对中朝两国共同敌人——美国侵略者斗争中光荣牺牲的烈士和这位不朽的朝鲜母亲。
    两年以前，志愿军战士们亲手把这位不朽的朝鲜母亲埋葬在这里。当时部队迅速南进，没有来得及把这件事情的底细告诉朝鲜人民，直到去年春天，志愿军某部战士们到墓前进行隆重的祭奠时，当地人民才从一位战士李治黄的口中知道了这位不朽的朝鲜母亲生前的动人事迹。
    这位不朽的朝鲜母亲，战前在平壤的一个纺织厂里工作。她的丈夫在战争爆发后参加了人民军。那时，她已经怀了孕。当敌人侵占平壤的前几天，她带着七岁的孩子金永洙逃难。一九五零年十月二十六日，母子两人来到云山地区，在一座山岭上遇到了志愿军的前哨警戒部队。那时她已到临产期了，志愿军的战士们便把她和她的孩子送出了火线。第二天，她就在志愿军的照顾下生了孩子。她产后的身体还算健康，可是新生的婴儿却因战争的折磨而死去。志愿军战士们在紧张战斗的空隙中，轮流地为她送水、送饭，还给她母子两人送去御寒的棉军衣。这位朝鲜母亲在志愿军战士们的热诚照顾下感动得流下了热泪。
    几天后，她发觉经常来照顾她的战士李治黄不见了，其他的战士也在为一件什么事情而难过着。她向战士们再三追问，才知道李治黄出去执行侦察任务时没有回来，直到现在还是下落不明。这时，她的身体已经渐渐复元了，她立刻要求到敌后去探听李治黄的消息，她再三向志愿军的一位团长说：“你们为了援助我们的祖国不惜流血牺牲，我更应该给自己的祖国做一点事情，请允许我为了我的祖国去和敌人进行斗争吧！”
    这个朝鲜母亲就此带着七岁的孩子，怀里藏着一个手榴弹，一直向敌占区走去。她到处探听的结果，终于从没有来得及撤退的朝鲜老人、妇女和儿童那里知道了李治黄的下落：李治黄在进行侦察时不幸落到了敌人的手里，被囚禁在一处山沟中的房子里。于是她立刻想办法赶去营救这个战士。她给孩子找了一把镰刀，要孩子在她和敌人纠缠时，想法把镰刀送给志愿军叔叔，她嘱咐孩子，要他和李治黄脱险后一起从后山坡上转出去，并且向她丢一块小石子做信号。她给孩子的最后遗言是：“至于我……你听到手榴弹响，就不要再盼望妈妈了。你不要伤心，志愿军叔叔是会照顾你的，还有我们金日成将军会把你抚养成人，但你必须牢牢记住对敌人的仇恨！”孩子默默地答应了，他跟随着母亲向监禁着李治黄的地方走去。
    在一条山沟里，有四间房子。敌人在这里设立了临时监狱，并且有五个美国兵在警戒着。屋外的两个美国兵看见过来了一位带着孩子的中年妇女，就下流地上去拦住她，她乘机大骂起来，以致把屋子里另外三个美国兵也惊动出来。敌人被她纠缠住了，她就向孩子暗示了一下。这时，孩子便乖巧地从一边溜向屋里，用手势告诉李治黄他是来搭救他的。他用镰刀割断了捆缚李治黄的绳子。李治黄马上接过镰刀，就和孩子从后门悄悄地走了出去。这时孩子还听到母亲正在同敌人纠缠的声音，便向母亲那边抛了一块石头，告诉他和李治黄已安然脱险了。不久手榴弹爆炸了，这位伟大的朝鲜母亲，在打死兽兵的同时，自己也光荣地为祖国牺牲了。
    李治黄回到部队，向大家报告了这件事情的经过。团长和战士们都对这位英雄的母亲怀着无限的敬意和悼念。云山战斗胜利后，他们便把这位不朽的朝鲜母亲的遗体和志愿军的烈士埋葬在一起。孤儿金永洙也在志愿军战士们的照料下，转送到朝鲜政府的爱育院里。
    现在，这位英雄的朝鲜母亲的墓上，正生长着终年长青的松柏。她在反抗中朝人民共同敌人——美国侵略者的斗争中所建立的功绩永垂不朽。
