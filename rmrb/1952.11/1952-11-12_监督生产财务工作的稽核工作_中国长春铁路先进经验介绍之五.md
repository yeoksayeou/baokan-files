Supervising the Auditing Work of Production and Finance
——Introduction to Advanced Experiences of China Changchun Railway (5)
Ye Keming, Chief Auditor of the Supervisory Board of China Changchun Railway Company

For more than two years, under the direct assistance of Soviet experts, the auditing work of the China Changchun Railway has developed into an effective system for supervising the production, finance, and business management of all railway agencies, enterprises, and organizations. Since the Chinese People's Railways had not previously established an auditing system, the experience of the China Changchun Railway in implementing auditing work is particularly valuable.

Although the China Changchun Railway encountered some difficulties and obstacles in implementing auditing work, it has played a significant role in supervising and assisting in the completion of production and financial plans. Over the past two years (May 1950 to the first half of 1952), 4,887 cases of over-planned expenditures were uncovered and prevented; in the first half of 1952 alone, it assisted the administration in identifying and stopping the phenomenon of exceeding the quota by 6,659 people. Auditing personnel regularly inspect the use of working capital by various economic accounting units. From the second half of 1951 to the first half of 1952, over-standard reserve materials worth 344.6 billion yuan (including finished products, semi-finished products, obsolete and waste materials, etc.) were found.

The auditing personnel of the China Changchun Railway closely monitor the railway's income, inspected 1,888 trains, issued 388 letters of recommendation for improving railway income, and discovered many instances of missed and under-collected payments, actively urging various units to recover them. One of the regular and important tasks of auditing work is anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy. In the past two years, the implementation of the Bureau Director's orders has been inspected 2,288 times, and 482 cases of violations of orders have been found. In order to overcome the waste of locomotive and vehicle utilization, 93 suggestions were put forward, and the consumption of materials and fuel was inspected on-site 941 times, and discrepancies between accounts and materials were inspected 781 times. For those who were guilty of corruption and dereliction of duty, it was recommended that the administration give them the punishment they deserved. In order to improve the quality of accounting and statistics work throughout the railway, treasuries were inspected 597 times, and 534 cases of violations of financial discipline were found, such as misuse of subjects, illegal expenditures, and unplanned expenditures. In addition, resolute struggles were carried out against the phenomenon of falsely reporting achievements.

Of course, auditing work is not only for exposing mistakes, but more importantly for improving work. Over the past two years, a total of 1,606 letters of recommendation for improving work have been issued, thereby improving the work. Auditing personnel have made 52 analyses of operations and 139 analyses of final accounts. These analyses reflect the overall picture of enterprise management and directly help administrative leaders to grasp the business.

The Auditing Bureau is directly under the Supervisory Board of the China Changchun Railway. In order to carry out supervision and inspection work specifically, the Auditing Bureau has established auditing sections along each line according to the boundaries of the sub-bureaus under the jurisdiction of the Bureau.

The experience of the China Changchun Railway's auditing work proves that in addition to the administrative management机构 itself regularly inspecting the work, it is also necessary to establish independent organizations and systems dedicated to supervision in order to expose the shortcomings in production and financial work ruthlessly and deeply, to effectively supervise the administration to improve work and overcome shortcomings, and to help administrative leaders in a timely manner to not only handle production and financial issues from the needs of the work, but also to consider issues from the perspective of complying with the state-approved production and financial plans. Therefore, those who believe that strengthening inspection work from the administrative aspect can replace auditing work are inappropriate.

The China Changchun Railway implements the auditing system, adopting a method that emphasizes both ex-ante auditing and ex-post supervision. Ex-ante auditing means that all withdrawals of railway cash, issuance of materials, and signing of sales contracts must be approved in advance by the auditing authority or auditor, and stamped with an approval stamp on the document to be legal. If the auditor does not agree to the payment but the head of the unit insists on payment, the head still has the right to pay, but must bear full responsibility for the payment, and must submit a written explanation to the auditing authority within three days for handling by the higher level. By the end of 1950, all units of the China Changchun Railway had implemented the ex-ante auditing system. Since then, there have been 3,347 cases of payments that auditors disagreed with, so ex-ante auditing is the most effective way to prevent non-productive payments, prevent exceeding quotas, prevent unplanned expenditures, and prevent the railway from suffering losses in transactions.

Ex-post supervision is divided into two methods: one is to conduct a comprehensive supervision of the production and financial work of a business unit within a certain period. All documents, cards, contracts, records, plans, final accounts, accounts, statistics, reports, and other documents, as well as cash materials, etc., must be inspected and audited to determine the overall situation of the unit's management and whether the economic accounting system is developing steadily, so comprehensive supervision can reflect the entire situation of enterprise management and is the main method of supervising enterprises. The second is partial supervision, that is, supervision on specific issues. Such as inspection of the implementation of a certain order of the Bureau Director, such as inspection of full loading, over-axle, and 500-kilometer movement. This kind of supervision plays a role in promoting the implementation of orders and resolutions.

In the past two years, the China Changchun Railway has conducted 197 comprehensive supervisions and 1,539 partial supervisions. The problems and shortcomings found in each inspection are recorded, and the supervisors and the heads of the supervised units must personally sign the records. The heads of the supervised units must also submit explanations for clarification or self-criticism. Facts have proved that holding a meeting of cadres and worker representatives with the participation of supervisors after each supervision, and展开批评与自我批评展开批评与自我批评conducting criticism and self-criticism, is the most effective way to improve work. In order to help the progress of the work of various units, after the comprehensive supervision, a re-examination is carried out after a certain period to promote the improvement of the work of various units.

Because the China Changchun Railway adopted two auditing methods, ex-ante auditing and ex-post supervision, it has conducted systematic, timely, and effective supervision of production and financial work.

However, the top-down supervision implemented by state organs must be closely combined with the supervision of the Party and the bottom-up supervision of the masses in order to play a more effective supervisory role. However, in the past period, many Chinese auditors of the China Changchun Railway believed that auditing work was purely a business work, and that they had completed their tasks by conducting inspections based on business knowledge, making records, and making suggestions. This purely business viewpoint is incorrect. After the Party's education, especially after the great "Three-Anti" Movement, the auditing personnel reviewed and corrected this purely business viewpoint divorced from politics, and initially clarified the principle that auditing work must be combined with the supervision of the masses, and realized the importance of relying on the masses and the organizations of the masses, and clarified that relying on the Party's organization is the key to doing a good job in auditing work.

Experience has proved that after the auditing work is combined with the supervision of the masses, the horizons of the auditing personnel have been broadened and the power of supervision has been strengthened. Many problems that are not easily detected by auditing personnel have been reflected by auditors who are not separated from production. For example, some auditors who are not separated from production revealed that some locomotive depots were doing black work and spreading the costs in repairs, as well as the phenomenon of many units keeping off-book products. Due to the provision of clues by the masses, a large number of illegal incidents were found. The incident of a sub-bureau falsely reporting a major repair final account of 213 million yuan is an example.

The auditing work of the China Changchun Railway has not been carried out smoothly. In the process of carrying out auditing work, struggles have been carried out against the erroneous thoughts and work styles of some cadres—especially those with economic control. To do a good job in auditing work, it is necessary to require cadres to shift from not paying attention to auditing work to paying attention to it, from not accepting criticism to accepting criticism, from not implementing suggestions to implementing suggestions, especially to require cadres to lead production and progress to leading production and financial work, that is, to improve financial viewpoints and strengthen supervision of financial work. It is undeniable that in the past two years, after various struggles, most of the cadres of the China Changchun Railway have made significant progress in these aspects, and most of the cadres have realized that the goals of auditing work and administrative work are consistent. The criticism and suggestions of auditing staff are not picking on the faults of administrative cadres, but directly helping administrative cadres to improve the management of enterprises, so that the economic accounting system can be implemented and consolidated. At present, a strict atmosphere of abiding by financial regulations has been initially established among the cadres of the China Changchun Railway. All these advances are important conditions for the smooth development of auditing work and the great achievements it has achieved, and also an important guarantee for the China Changchun Railway to complete and overfulfill its production and financial plans, eliminate overspending, and have huge savings.

Experience proves that auditing work is not only a business work, but also a propaganda and education work. Auditors must often use propaganda and education methods, use the weapon of criticism and self-criticism to help administrative cadres consciously attach importance to economic work. Abide by financial discipline. This is the main key to improving production and financial work.

Because the auditing personnel of the China Changchun Railway conduct inspection work in a realistic manner, and point out the shortcomings in the work with real evidence instead of relying on hearsay, this inspection is convincing. At any meeting, the auditing personnel do not relax to put forward criticism and suggestions, and each inspection compares the previous inspection with the current inspection to explain the situation of cadres correcting their shortcomings. Auditors have conducted and will continue to conduct serious struggles against those who refuse criticism. All this shows that auditing work is of practical help to the improvement of cadres' thinking.

In order to improve the quality of auditors, the China Changchun Railway held two training courses in 1951, which were entirely taught by Soviet experts. In addition, in spare-time education, Soviet experts taught at least 1,560 hours of courses. Under the direct training and education of Soviet experts, all auditors have learned to undertake the task of ex-ante auditing, and most auditors can conduct comprehensive document supervision, operation analysis, or analysis of final accounts and balance sheets.

This auditing force, which appeared for the first time on the Chinese People's Railways, has grown from nothing and developed. The establishment and development of the auditing system of the China Changchun Railway is a good start. We can foresee that the auditing system, which has important political and economic significance, will be valued by the Chinese people and gradually promoted, because it is the most effective and suitable system for consolidating the victory of the "Three-Anti" Movement, because it is an important link in implementing and consolidating the economic accounting system and guaranteeing the completion of production and financial plans.

    监督生产财务工作的稽核工作
    ——中国长春铁路先进经验介绍之五
    中国长春铁路公司监事会总稽核  叶克明
    两年多来，中长铁路的稽核工作，在苏联专家直接帮助下，已经发展成为监督铁路一切机关企业及组织的生产财务和业务管理的有效制度。由于中国人民铁路向未建立过稽核制度，所以中长铁路执行稽核工作的经验，就非常宝贵了。
    中长铁路在执行稽核工作过程中虽然遇到一些困难和阻碍，但稽核工作在监督与帮助生产财务计划的完成方面，已发挥了巨大的作用。两年多来（一九五○年五月至一九五二年上半年），揭发与防止超计划的支出共有四千八百八十七件；仅一九五二年上半年，即协助行政查出并制止了超过定员六千六百五十九人的现象。稽核人员经常检查各经济核算单位关于流动资金运用的情况。自一九五一年下半年至一九五二年上半年，共查出价值三千四百四十六亿元的超标准储备材料（包括成品、半成品、呆废料等）。
    中长铁路的稽核人员密切地关心铁路的收入，曾检查过一千八百八十八次列车，发出改善铁路收入的三百八十八件建议信，并发现很多漏收、少收款项的现象，积极地督促各单位追收。稽核工作的经常重要任务之一是反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义。二年来，检查管理局长命令的贯彻执行情况，共有二千二百八十八次，曾发现违背命令的有四百八十二件。为了克服机车、车辆运用上的浪费现象，曾提出九十三件建议，并到现场检查材料、燃料的消耗的情况达九百四十一次，检查账料不合的情况，也达七百八十一次。对于贪污渎职人员，均建议行政给以应得的处分。为了提高全路会计统计工作的质量，曾检查金库五百九十七次，发现违反财务纪律的有五百三十四件，如乱用科目、非法开支、无计划开支等。此外对于伪报成绩的现象，也进行了坚决的斗争。
    当然稽核工作不仅仅是为了揭发错误，更重要的是为了改善工作。二年多来，共发出一千六百零六件改善工作的建议函，从而改善了工作。稽核人员共作运营工作的分析五十二件，作决算的分析一百三十九件，这些分析都反映了企业经营管理的全貌，直接帮助了行政领导干部对业务的掌握。
    稽查局直属于中长铁路的监事会。为了具体地进行监察与检查工作，稽核局又按管理局所属各分局的界限，建立各沿线的稽核股。
    中长铁路稽核工作的经验证明：除了行政管理机构本身须经常检查工作以外，还必须建立独立的专司监督的组织和制度，才能无情地、深刻地揭发生产财务工作中的缺点，才能有效地监督行政改进工作克服缺点，才能及时地帮助行政首长不但从工作的需要上来处理生产财务问题，而且还要从遵守国家批准的生产财务计划上来考虑问题。因而那些认为从行政方面加强检查工作就可以代替稽核工作的论调，是不妥当的。
    中长铁路实行稽核制度，采取了事先稽核与事后监察并重的方式。事先稽核就是：凡动支铁路现金、发放材料、签定买卖合同等，均需于事先取得稽核机关或稽核员同意，并在文件上加盖同意戳记，方为合法。如稽核员不同意支付而单位首长坚持支付时，则首长仍有权支付，但须对该项支付担负完全责任，并须在三天内，向稽核机关提出理由书，由上级处理。在一九五○年末，中长铁路全部单位，均已实行了事先稽核的制度。自此以后，稽核员不同意的支付共有三千三百四十七次，所以事先稽核是防止非生产的支付，防止超过定员，防止无计划的开支和防止铁路遭受交易上的损失的最有效的方法。
    事后监察分为两种方式：一种是在一定期间内，对于一个业务单位的生产财务工作进行全面的监察。所有一切单据、卡片、合同、记录、计划、决算、账表、统计、报告等文件以及现金材料等，均须实行检查审核，从而判明该单位经营管理的全面情况及经济核算制是否在巩固的发展，所以全面监察能反映企业经营管理的全部情况，是监督企业的主要方法。第二种是部分监察，也就是对专门问题的监察。如对管理局长某一命令执行情况的检查，如对满载、超轴、五百公里运动的检查等。这种监察，对于贯彻命令、执行决议，有着推动的作用。
    二年多来，中长铁路已进行全面监察一百九十七次，部分监察一千五百三十九次。每次检查出来的问题和缺点，都作成记录，监察人员和被监察的单位的首长都须亲自在记录上签字。被监察的单位的首长还须提出说明书，进行申述或检讨。事实证明：每次监察以后，召开有监察人员参加的干部和职工代表会议，展开批评与自我批评，是一种最有效的改进工作的方式。为了帮助各单位工作的进步，在全面监察以后，经过一定期间，再进行一次复查，以促进各单位改进工作。
    中长铁路因为采用了事先稽核和事后监察的两种稽核方式，所以对于生产财务工作进行了系统的、及时的、有效的监督。
    但是国家机关所实行的自上而下的监督，必须和党的监督、群众自下而上的监督密切地结合起来，才能发挥更有效的监督作用。但过去一个时期，中长铁路不少中国稽核员曾认为稽核工作单纯是个业务工作，以为凭着业务知识进行检查，作完记录，提出建议，就算完成了任务。这种单纯业务观点是不正确的。经过党的教育，特别在伟大“三反”运动以后，稽核人员检讨了并纠正着这种脱离政治的单纯业务观点，初步明确了稽核工作必须和群众的监督相结合的道理，认识到依靠群众，依靠群众的组织的重要性，明确了依靠党的组织是作好稽核工作的关键。
    经验证明：稽核工作和群众的监督相结合以后，稽核人员的眼界就扩大了，监督的力量也加强了。有许多问题是不容易被稽核人员查觉的却被不脱离生产的稽核员反映出来了。比如有些不脱离生产的稽核员揭发了某些机务段做黑活，而把费用摊在检修中，以及许多单位保留账外品等现象。由于群众供给线索，查出大量违法事件。一分局伪报二亿一千三百万元的大修决算的事件，就是一例。
    中长铁路的稽核工作，并不是一帆风顺地开展起来的。在开展稽核工作过程中，曾经和某些干部——尤其是具有经济支配权的某些干部的错误思想作风进行了斗争。要做好稽核工作必须要求干部对稽核工作由不重视转为重视，由不接受批评转为接受批评，由不执行建议变为执行建议，特别要求干部由单纯领导生产进步到领导生产财务工作，也就是提高财务观点，加强对财务工作的监督。不可否认，二年多来，经过各种斗争，中长铁路大部分干部在这些方面已经有了显著的进步，大部干部已认识到稽核工作与行政工作的目标是一致的。稽核工作人员的批评与建议，不是在挑行政干部的毛病，而是直接帮助行政干部对企业经营管理的改进，从而使经济核算制得以贯彻与巩固。目前在中长铁路的干部中，已初步树立了严格遵守财务制度的风气。所有这些进步，正是稽核工作能够顺利开展并获得很大成绩的重要条件，同时也是中长铁路完成并超额完成生产财务计划，消灭超支，并有巨额节约的重要保证。
    经验证明：稽核工作不单是个业务工作，而且也是宣传教育工作。稽核工作者必须经常用宣传教育的方法，运用批评自我批评的武器，来帮助行政干部自觉地重视经济工作。遵守财务纪律。这是改进生产财务工作的主要关键。
    由于中长铁路稽核人员实事求是地进行检查工作，不根据道听途说而找出真凭实据来指出工作中的缺点，因此这种检查是有说服力的。在任何会议上，稽核人员都不放松提出批评与建议，每次检查都将上次检查与本次检查来加以比较，以说明干部改正缺点的情况。稽核工作者曾对那些拒绝批评的人们，进行过并将继续进行着严肃的斗争。所有这一切，都说明了稽核工作对于干部思想的提高是有实际帮助的。
    为了提高稽核员的质量，中长铁路在一九五一年内曾举办过两期训练班，完全由苏联专家讲课。此外，在业余教育中，苏联专家讲授了至少有一千五百六十小时课程。在苏联专家直接培养、教育下，全体稽核员均已学会担当事先稽核的任务，有大部分稽核员已能作全面文件监察、运营分析或决算与资产负债表的分析。
    在中国人民铁路上第一次出现的这一支稽核力量，已经从无到有，并且发育、成长起来。中长铁路稽核制度的建立与发展，是一个良好的开端。我们可以预见：具有重要政治与经济意义的稽核制度，势将被中国人民所重视而逐渐地被推广起来，因为它是巩固“三反”胜利的一种最有效的与最适宜的制度，因为它是贯彻与巩固经济核算制，保证生产财务计划完成的一个重要环节。
