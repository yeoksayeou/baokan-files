    Curriculum for Implementing Production and Financial Plans—Technical Organizational Measures Plan
    ——Introduction to Advanced Experience of Changchun Railway in China (II)
    Li Junping, Assistant Chief Engineer of China Changchun Railway Administration
    Under the enthusiastic guidance of Soviet experts, the China Changchun Railway has formulated a technical organizational measures plan. This is the advanced experience of Soviet socialist enterprise management. The China Changchun Railway has three important documents: the production and financial plan, the technical organizational measures plan, and the collective contract. The production and financial plan tells us "what to do" and stipulates our production tasks. The technical organizational measures plan is a supplementary document to the production and financial plan, telling us "how to do it" and what methods we should use to complete production tasks.
    After the China Changchun Railway formulates its production and financial plan, it is necessary to formulate a technical organizational measures plan. Based on the production characteristics, equipment level, utilization efficiency, and worker skill level of the China Changchun Railway, improvement measures for work organization and technology are drafted for each work link and each work process throughout the year. These measures not only address the weaknesses in the work but also pay attention to adopting advanced technical operation methods and the advanced experience of model workers. With this technical organizational measures plan, leaders and staff can correctly organize the production process, practice thrift, and leverage the internal potential of the enterprise to improve productivity and enterprise profits.
    The content of the technical organizational measures plan is very specific. The plan not only specifies the implementation period, location, and person in charge, but also expresses the economic effects of implementing the plan in actual monetary terms.
    The formulation of the technical organizational measures plan is conducted in an organized, led, and step-by-step manner. First, the chief engineer of the China Changchun Railway Administration analyzes the requirements of the production tasks stipulated in the annual production and financial plan, and refers to last year's work summary and the advanced working methods of various business departments. Then, the chief engineers and advanced workers of various departments of the Administration are convened to jointly formulate a preliminary outline of the technical organizational measures plan, stipulating the key points that each department should implement and the advanced experiences and new technical methods that must be promoted. This preliminary outline is distributed to various sub-bureaus and on-site stations and sections. Each station and section formulates its own measures plan and specific supplementary items based on its own annual production and financial plan and specific circumstances. Advanced workers must be invited to participate in the formulation of the unit's measures plan. After the unit's measures plan is drafted, the unit will convene workshop group meetings and general meetings of all employees to discuss and approve it, and submit it to the superior for approval. After receiving the plans from various stations and sections, the sub-bureaus and various competent departments will review, analyze, and compile them into a comprehensive plan for the entire sub-bureau, which will be submitted to the Administration's technical meeting for discussion and approval, and finally approved by the Director of the Administration and promulgated by order.
    After receiving the technical organizational measures plan approved by the superior, each sub-bureau, station, and section, with the help of the Party committee, trade union, and Youth League, will further disseminate and discuss it, so that each group, workshop, and even every worker and staff member clearly understands which technical organizational measures they should take, how to do it, and what requirements should be met. Then, they will earnestly implement it in accordance with the specified time and designated person in charge. During the implementation process, continuous attention should be paid to the new methods and technologies emerging among the masses, and the new methods and technologies proposed by the masses should be supported, summarized, and promoted in a timely manner to enrich the original measures. At the same time, various short-term training courses should be organized and demonstrations and performances should be held to enable workers to master advanced technologies and advanced working methods. This prepares the conditions for the implementation of technical organizational measures.
    The first technical organizational measures plan of the China Changchun Railway in 1951 was compiled under the specific guidance of Soviet experts. The content of this year's technical organizational measures plan is more complete, and the value of savings is even greater. For example, last year's savings amounted to 59.1 billion yuan; this year's savings increased to 99 billion yuan. As a result of implementing technical organizational measures, each department has achieved brilliant results. The transportation department has implemented advanced shunting methods, thereby increasing the labor productivity of shunting groups by 19.4 percent. The average weight of freight trains increased by 158 tons. The locomotive department has implemented technical organizational measures, shortening the turnaround time for locomotive washing and inspection by 7 hours, and increasing the washing and inspection mileage of freight locomotives from 4,450 kilometers to 5,400 kilometers. The promotion of advanced working methods in departments such as rolling stock, civil engineering, business, telecommunications, and materials has saved the state a large amount of wealth. The business department promoted Yang Maolin's loading method, saving 12,144 freight cars and 25 billion yuan in expenses. All departments across the railway have also achieved great results in saving materials. The original plan was to reduce material expenditure by 51.3 billion yuan, but 50.2 billion yuan in material expenditure had already been saved within half a year.
    In the implementation of technical organizational measures, the entire railway widely launched a rationalization proposal movement. The total number of rationalization proposals put forward in 1950 was only 1,980, which increased to 7,310 in 1951. Within the first nine months of 1952, the entire railway had put forward 11,146 rationalization proposals, of which 5,101 were adopted, 3,616 were promoted, and more than 15 billion yuan was saved.
    From the results of the past two years, the technical organizational measures plan is a powerful guarantee for completing the production and financial plan and implementing the increase production and practice economy campaign, an effective method for comprehensively and systematically leveraging the internal potential of the enterprise, saving expenses, and increasing accumulation, and a powerful lever for systematically promoting advanced technologies and advanced methods. With it, the labor competition enthusiasm of employees will be further consolidated and enhanced. Therefore, in the future, we should humbly learn from Soviet experts, inherit and consolidate these advanced experiences to further improve the people's railway. (Attached pictures)

    实现生产财务计划的课程表—技术组织措施计划
    ——中国长春铁路先进经验介绍之二
    中国长春铁路管理局助理总工程师  李均平
    在苏联专家热心指导下，中国长春铁路编制了技术组织措施计划。这是苏联社会主义管理企业的先进经验。中国长春铁路有三个重要的文件，这就是生产财务计划，技术组织措施计划和集体合同。生产财务计划是告诉我们“做什么”，是规定我们生产任务的。技术组织措施计划是生产财务计划的补充文件，是告诉我们“怎样做”，是告诉我们应该用什么方法完成生产任务的。
    在中长铁路编定生产财务计划以后，要编制技术组织措施计划。根据中长铁路的生产特点、设备水平、使用效率、工人技术水平，按着每一工作环节，每一工作过程，分别地拟出在全年内改进工作组织，改进技术的措施。这个措施，不仅针对了工作中的弱点，而且注意到采用先进技术操作方法和模范工作者的先进经验。有了这种技术组织措施计划，领导者和工作人员，就可以正确地组织生产过程，厉行节约，发挥企业内部潜在的能力，以便提高生产率和企业的利润。
    技术组织措施计划的内容非常具体。在计划中，不但规定了实行期限、地点、负责执行人，而且还以实际金额表示由于实现计划而产生的经济效果。
    技术组织措施计划的编制，是有组织、有领导、有步骤地进行的。首先由中国长春铁路管理局总工程师分析本年生产财务计划内所规定的生产任务的要求，并参考去年的工作总结和各业务部门的先进工作方法，然后召集管理局各处总工程师、先进工作者，共同拟定技术组织措施计划的初步纲要，规定各部门应该实施的重点和必须推行的先进经验和新技术方法。把这个初步纲要分发到各分局和现场各站、段之后，各站、段根据本年自己的生产财务计划和具体情况，制定出本单位的措施计划和具体补充项目。在制定本单位措施计划时，必须邀请先进工作者参加。当本单位的措施计划拟好以后，本单位要召开车间小组会议，全体员工大会，进行讨论、通过，并呈报上级批准。分局及各主管处接到各站、段的计划后，加以审查、分析，编制成全分局的综合计划，交给管理局技术会议讨论、通过，最后由管理局长批准，以命令公布之。
    各分局各站、段接到上级批准的技术组织措施计划之后，依靠党委、工会、青年团的帮助，再进行传达讨论，使每个小组、车间以至每一个工人、职员明确了解到自己应当作那几项技术组织措施，如何作法，要达到什么样的要求等，然后按照规定的时间和指定的负责人，认真地去执行。在执行过程中，要不断地注意在群众中涌现出的新方法和新技术，并且还要及时地支持、总结和推广群众所提出来的新方法和新技术，以丰富原规定的措施；同时，还组织各种短期训练班，举行示范、表演，使得工人掌握先进技术和先进工作方法。这样就为技术组织措施的实现准备了条件。
    一九五一年中长铁路第一个技术组织措施计划，是由苏联专家具体指导下编制成的。今年的技术组织措施计划的内容更加完善了，节约的价值也更大了。如去年节约额五百九十一亿元；而今年节约额增至九百九十亿元。各个部门由于实行技术组织措施，各个部门都获得了辉煌的效果。车务部门贯彻了先进调车方法，因而调车组的劳动生产率提高了百分之十九点四。货物列车平均重量增加了一百五十八吨。机务部门实行技术组织措施，机车洗检的停留时间缩短了七小时，货运机车的洗检走行公里由四千四百五十公里提高到五千四百公里。在车辆、工务、商务、电务、材料等部门推行了先进工作方法，都节省了国家大量的财富。商务部门推行了杨茂林装车法，节省车皮一万二千一百四十四辆，节约经费二百五十亿元。全路各部门在节约材料方面，也有很大效果。全路原计划减低材料支出五百十三亿元，而在半年内即已节约材料支出五百零二亿元。
    实行技术组织措施中，全路广泛地展开合理化建议运动。一九五○年提出的合理化建议总数仅一千九百八十件，一九五一年就增加到七千三百一十件。一九五二年九个月内全路提出的合理化建议已有一万一千一百四十六件，其中采纳的有五千一百零一件，推行的有三千六百十六件，节省了一百五十亿多元。
    从两年来实行的结果看来，技术组织措施计划是完成生产财务计划和贯彻增产节约的有力保证，是完整而系统地发挥企业内部潜力、节省开支、增加积累的有效方法，也是有组织地推行先进技术、先进方法的有力杠杆。有了它，员工的劳动竞赛热情就会更加巩固和提高。因此今后我们就应该虚心地向苏联专家学习，继承并巩固这些先进经验，以进一步办好人民铁路。（附图片）
