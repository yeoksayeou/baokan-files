    Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 20th: A frontline correspondent for this agency reports: On the hills near the battle-scarred Shangganling, a Matrosov-like combat hero has emerged – Huang Jiguang, a communications soldier of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. He is a great soldier of whom the Chinese people can be proud.
    During a counter-attack, an enemy firing point suddenly appeared on the path of our army's assault. Three machine guns fired wildly, blocking our advance. The commander said to the assault team, "Who will take it out?" A young communications soldier, Huang Jiguang, replied, "I will!" Huang Jiguang knew that the homeland people's comfort delegation had arrived on the Korean front. He said confidently to his comrades, "Tell the homeland people's comfort delegation to await news of my victory!" Then he said, "Comrades, prepare to charge!" He then charged forward with hand grenades. The enemy's machine-gun fire was extremely fierce, and he was hit by several bullets not far after he rushed out. The comrades behind him saw him stagger, but he continued to rush towards the enemy bunker. When the enemy's bullets hit Huang Jiguang's body again, he had already pounced on the enemy's fortifications and used his body to block an enemy gun aperture that was firing. Then, his comrades launched the assault. At this moment, two other machine guns on the enemy's firing point started up again. In this critical moment, Huang Jiguang stretched out an arm and stuffed a hand grenade into the enemy's firing point. With a thunderous roar, the enemy's firing point was completely destroyed.
    After the battle ended, comrades found nine machine gun bullet holes in Huang Jiguang's body. A commander said with deep emotion, "Matrosov, the Chinese Matrosov!" On the phone, Huang Jiguang's comrades told his heroic deeds to the representatives of the homeland people's comfort delegation who had come to this front line. They said, "Please tell Chairman Mao that he is his good soldier; please tell the people of the motherland that he is their good son – an ordinary soldier of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, Comrade Huang Jiguang, before his glorious sacrifice, asked us to tell you that he had fulfilled his responsibility to the motherland and the cause of peace."

    马特洛索夫式的中国人民志愿军战斗英雄
    黄继光舍身炸敌堡扫清进军道路
    【新华社朝鲜前线二十日电】本社前线通讯员报道：在战火纷飞的上甘岭附近的山岭上，出现了一位马特洛索夫式的战斗英雄——中国人民志愿军某部通讯员黄继光。他是中国人民值得骄傲的伟大的战士。
    在一次反击战中，我军的冲锋道路上突然出现了一个敌人的火力点，三挺机关枪疯狂地扫射着，挡住了我军前进的道路。指挥员对突击队员们说：“谁去干掉它？”一个年青的通讯员黄继光答道：“我去！”黄继光知道祖国人民慰问团到了朝鲜前线，他满怀信心地向战友们说：“告诉祖国人民慰问团，听我胜利的消息吧！”接着他又说了一声：“同志们准备冲！”便提着手雷向前冲去。敌人的机枪扫射得十分猛烈，他刚冲过去不多远，身上就中了几颗子弹；后面的战友们只见他摇幌了一下，又向着敌人地堡扑去。当敌人的子弹再次射中了黄继光的身体的时候，他已经扑到敌人的工事上，并用身体堵住了一个正在发射的敌人的枪眼。接着，他的战友们便发起了冲锋。这时敌人的火力点上另外两挺机枪又叫起来，正在这个紧急的时候，黄继光伸出了一只手臂，把一颗手雷塞进敌人的火力点里，轰然一声，敌人的火力点被完全炸毁了。
    战斗结束以后，战友们在黄继光的身上找到九个机枪子弹射透的洞口。一个指挥员带着深厚的感情连声地说道：“马特洛索夫，中国的马特洛索夫！”在电话里，黄继光的战友们把他的英雄事迹告诉了来到这一线阵地上的祖国人民慰问团的代表们，他们说：“请你们转告毛主席，是他的好战士；请你们转告祖国人民，是他们的好子弟——中国人民志愿军的普通一兵黄继光同志，在光荣牺牲前，叫我们告诉你们，他为祖国与和平事业尽到了责任。”
