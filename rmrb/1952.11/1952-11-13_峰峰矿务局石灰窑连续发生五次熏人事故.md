To the Editor: We are workers of the state-owned Fengfeng Mining Bureau. We want to expose the erroneous thinking of the leaders at all levels of the Shihuiyao (Lime Kiln) of the Subsidiary Industry Section of the Basic Construction Department of the Fengfeng Mining Bureau, who are solely pursuing the completion of tasks and neglecting the safety of workers' lives. This erroneous thinking has already resulted in five successive cases of people being suffocated: twenty-one workers have been overcome by fumes, and one worker almost lost his life.

In order to get the lime kiln to produce more lime, the Sand and Gravel Plant of the Basic Construction Department of the Mining Bureau decided to adopt the method of loading the kiln and lighting the fire at the same time. That is to say, the kiln was lit before it was full, and the workers were told to continue loading on top of the kiln that was already on fire. However, they did not consider the workers' safety. Five or six lime kilns were lit at the same time, and the entire area was filled with carbon smoke and the smoke from burning lime. All the loading workers and on-site staff were overwhelmed. On September 9th, five workers suffered from headaches and nausea and had to rest for half an hour before returning to normal. On the 10th, another seven workers successively felt headaches. The leadership still did not pay attention to this problem. On the afternoon of the 11th, at about 5 p.m., three workers were overcome by fumes and had headaches. Zhang Yonghong fainted not far after leaving the kiln. He was sent to the hospital for artificial respiration and only regained consciousness after more than two hours. After this incident, the leadership did some research, but still did not take effective measures to prevent accidents. Therefore, on the 12th and 13th, three workers each day were overcome by fumes and suffered headaches.

We believe that the leadership of the Sand and Gravel Plant are solely pursuing increased production and neglecting the safety of workers' lives, and even after accidents occur, they do not take steps to prevent them. This is intolerable. We have seen that the People's Daily often solves various problems for workers, so we are telling you about this situation in the hope that you will assist in solving it.

### 峰峰矿务局石灰窑连续发生五次熏人事故

    峰峰矿务局石灰窑连续发生五次熏人事故
    编辑同志：我们是国营峰峰矿务局的工人。我们要揭发峰峰矿务局基本建设处副业科砂石厂石灰窑各级领导干部单纯追求完成任务、忽视工人生命安全的错误思想。这种错误思想，已经连续造成了五次熏人事故：有二十一个工人被熏倒，其中一个工人几乎丧失性命。
    矿务局基本建设处砂石厂为了让石灰窑多出石灰，就决定采取一面装窑、一面点火的办法。也就是说，石灰窑还没装满就点上了火，叫工人在已经点上了火的窑上继续运装。但他们对工人安全问题却没考虑，五六个灰窑一齐点上火，全场迷漫着炭烟和烧石灰的烟，所有装窑工人和在场的工作人员都被熏得受不了。九月九日，有五个工人被熏得头痛、作呕，下窑休息了半小时才恢复正常。十日，又有七个工人先后感到头痛。领导方面还是不重视这个问题。十一日下午五时多，有三个工人被熏得头发痛；其中张永红走下窑没多远，就晕倒了。经送医院施行人工呼吸，过了二个多小时才清醒过来。出了这个事件以后，领导方面算是研究了一下，但仍没有采取有效的防止事故的办法。因此，十二、十三两日各有工人三个被熏得头痛。
    我们认为，砂石厂领导方面单纯追求增产而忽视工人生命安全，甚至在发生事故后也不设法防止，这是令人不能容忍的。我们看到人民日报经常给工人解决各种问题，所以把这个情况告诉你们，希望你们协助解决。  王学祖  史书业
