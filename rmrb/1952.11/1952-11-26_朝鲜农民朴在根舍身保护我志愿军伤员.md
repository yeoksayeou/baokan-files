Xinhua News Agency, Kimhwa Front, Korea, November 25th: This reporter from the front reports: In the Korean people's stretcher team supporting the Battle of Triangle Hill, there was a farmer named Park Jae-geun, who risked his life to protect the safety of wounded Chinese Volunteer soldiers during an enemy air raid. Chinese People's Volunteer soldiers at the Kimhwa front and Korean residents near the rear are reverently praising Park Jae-geun, who demonstrated a noble spirit of internationalism, as the Korean Luo Shengjiao.

The story unfolded as follows: In the pitch-black night, enemy artillery shells continuously burst with flashes of light, and flares illuminated the steep cliffs and mountain ridges. In this moment of battle, Park Jae-geun and the stretcher team were moving steadily along the mountain ridges of the front line. Park Jae-geun warmly cared for the wounded Chinese Volunteer soldier lying on the stretcher, checking whether the soldier's blanket was letting in the wind and comforting the soldier in broken Chinese. During breaks, Park Jae-geun would also gesture to ask the soldier if he wanted water. When the soldier expressed his gratitude, he would smile and say, "China and Korea are one family."

Suddenly, the air defense sentry sounded an air raid alarm. After the stretcher team concealed the wounded by the roadside, enemy planes flew overhead. A string of sparks told Park Jae-geun that the enemy planes were dropping fragmentation bombs. At that moment, a noble thought surged into his mind – he must protect the Chinese friends who had shed blood for the Korean people. He had just turned over and lay on top of the wounded soldier when he heard a "boom." The fragmentation bomb dropped by the enemy plane exploded in the air, and a piece of shrapnel entered Park Jae-geun's body.

When Park Jae-geun woke up in the Volunteer Army hospital, his first words were: "Did the wounded comrade return? Was he wounded again?" The nurses, moved to tears, told him, "The wounded soldier was not injured again and has been safely sent to the hospital. Rest and recuperate!" Park Jae-geun closed his eyes peacefully. Later, this great Korean farmer gloriously sacrificed his life due to severe injuries and excessive blood loss.

On November 10th, the people of the martyr's hometown – Lankok Township, Hwacheon County – and representatives from the Volunteer Army units on the Kimhwa front held a grand memorial service to mourn Park Jae-geun, the immortal internationalist fighter who will forever live in the hearts of the Chinese and Korean people.

    朝鲜农民朴在根舍身保护我志愿军伤员
    【新华社朝鲜金化前线二十五日电】本社前线通讯员报道：在支援上甘岭战斗的朝鲜人民的担架队里有位名叫朴在根的农民，他在敌机的袭击下用自己的生命保护了志愿军伤员的安全。在金化前线的中国人民志愿军战士们和近后方的朝鲜居民们，都敬仰地把发扬了崇高的国际主义精神的朴在根誉为朝鲜人民的罗盛教。
    事情的经过是这样的：在漆黑的夜里，敌人打来的炮弹不时地迸发着火光，此起彼落的照明弹照亮了陡壁和山岭。在这战斗的时刻，朴在根和担架队员们正迈着稳健的步子在战线的山岗上行进。朴在根热切地照顾着躺在担架上的志愿军伤员，他一会儿看一看伤员的被子漏不漏风，一会儿用生硬的中国话安慰着伤员。在休息时，朴在根又用手势比划着问伤员要不要水喝。当伤员向他表示感谢时，他就笑着说：“中国、朝鲜，一家人。”
    突然，防空哨兵发出了空袭警报。当担架队员们把伤员们隐蔽在路边以后，敌机飞到了他们的上空。一串串的火花告诉朴在根：敌机在投杀伤弹了。这时在他心中立刻涌现出一个崇高的念头——必须保护已经为朝鲜人民流了鲜血的中国友人。他刚刚翻身伏在伤员身上，就听到“轰隆”一声，敌机投下的杀伤弹在空中爆炸了，一块弹片打进了朴在根的身体。
    朴在根在志愿军医院里苏醒过来后的第一句话就问：“伤员同志回来了没有？负伤没有？”护士们感动得含着泪花告诉他：“伤员没有再负伤，已经安全地送到医院里来了。你好好安心休养吧！”朴在根安祥地闭上了眼睛。后来，这位伟大的朝鲜农民因为伤势过重、流血过多而光荣牺牲了。
    十一月十日，烈士的家乡——淮阳郡兰谷面县里的朝鲜人民和金化前线志愿军部队派来的代表举行了隆重的追悼会，悼念这位将永远活在中朝人民心里的不朽的国际主义战士朴在根。
