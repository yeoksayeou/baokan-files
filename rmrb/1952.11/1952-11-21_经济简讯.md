    Anshan Iron and Steel Company's Open Hearth Furnace Continuously Sets New National Records
    In the process of promoting the Soviet Union's advanced "fast steelmaking method" and other operating methods, the No. X open hearth furnace of the Anshan Iron and Steel Company's Steelmaking Plant continuously set new national records for large open hearth steelmaking on November 6th and 8th. The time for each steelmaking cycle was shortened to 8 hours and 50 minutes on November 6th; on November 8th, it was further shortened to 8 hours and 19 minutes. This reached the standard for fast steelmaking (the plant's quota for steelmaking time is 10 hours, and shortening it to below 9 hours is considered fast steelmaking). The average utilization coefficient of this open hearth furnace bottom area has increased from 5.11 in 1950 to 7.05 now. The steelmaking time and utilization coefficient achieved by this furnace this time have greatly exceeded the steelmaking level of similar open hearth furnaces in various capitalist countries.
