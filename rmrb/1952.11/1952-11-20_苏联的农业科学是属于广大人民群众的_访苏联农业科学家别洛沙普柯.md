The Soviet agricultural network, composed of millions of state farms, collective farms, agricultural machinery stations, and agricultural scientific research institutions, is practically a huge academy of agricultural sciences, and can also be said to be a huge new type of agricultural university. The entire Soviet land, in the hands of the Soviet people – the great transformers of nature – is being transformed into a tidy and beautiful large garden, covered in greenery.

On an afternoon before the 35th anniversary of the October Revolution, we interviewed Beloshapko, a member of the Soviet cultural workers delegation, head of the Agronomy Department of the Timiryazev Agricultural Academy of the Soviet Union, and a Master of Agronomy. We asked her some questions and listened quietly to her talk like elementary school students; her words became increasingly clear to me as a magnificent picture.

We asked: What is the relationship between agricultural scientists, practical workers, and peasant masses in the Soviet Union? How does the Soviet Union scientifically summarize the advanced experiences created by the peasant masses? What systems and methods does the Soviet Union have for promoting high-yield experiences and science and technology? How is Soviet agricultural education combined with the actual practice of agricultural production? What measures will Soviet agricultural workers take to realize the new requirements for agriculture put forward by the 19th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party?

Beloshapko said: These questions are interrelated, and I will give a comprehensive answer. First and foremost, the Party of Lenin and Stalin gradually centralized the extremely scattered small-peasant economy, turning it into large-scale socialist agriculture. The socialist agricultural system opened up a broad road for science. In this way, agricultural scientific research and agricultural machinery can fully and rapidly exert their power. Then she explained that the nature of Soviet agricultural science itself also determines that it must be closely integrated with practice. World-renowned Soviet agricultural scientists such as Timiryazev (1843-1920), the soil scientist Williams (1863-1939), and the biologist Michurin (1855-1935) discovered new laws of the relationship between soil and biology, new laws of plant and animal life and heredity, and put agricultural science on the only correct dialectical materialist basis. They declared: Man can and must master the laws of nature, and control and transform nature according to human will. The army of Soviet agricultural scientists, advancing under the light of the doctrines of these scientists, closely integrated with practical workers and the peasant masses, has enabled many crops to achieve increasingly large harvests, and many kinds of livestock to become faster-breeding and better-quality breeds.

Beloshapko casually gave a few examples: In Siberia, a place with poor natural conditions, a female collective farm member named Sergeyeva harvested 101 quintals (equivalent to 20,200 Chinese Jin) of spring wheat per hectare (equivalent to 15 Chinese Mu); that is, more than 1346 Jin per Mu. Kelekiya Geabaovuta, a production team leader of the collective farm named "Marx", harvested 203 quintals of corn per hectare (equivalent to 40,600 Chinese Jin) on two hectares; that is, more than 2706 Jin per Mu. Zhirayev Ibrai, a socialist labor hero of the "Koreitu" collective farm, harvested 162 quintals of rice per hectare (equivalent to 32,400 Chinese Jin) on ten hectares; that is, 2160 Jin per Mu. The "Stalin" collective farm in Moscow Oblast can produce an average of 10,000 liters (liters are equivalent to Chinese Shi Sheng) of milk per cow per year. She said: Such high yields exist in various regions and various crops in the Soviet Union. The total output of spring and winter crops sown annually in the Soviet Union increases by hundreds of millions of Poods (each Pood is equivalent to 32.67 Chinese Jin) every year. In the meantime, scientists have played a huge role; advanced agricultural science is not empty talk, not a decoration, but a force that adds huge wealth to the agricultural economy. The achievements of Soviet agriculture that Beloshapko talked about proved Williams's famous saying: There is no bad soil, only bad cultivation techniques. This also shows that: once the land does not belong to those who only care about personal profits but belongs to the socialist country that only cares about the happiness of all the people, its productivity is endless. Beloshapko said in a firm and powerful voice: There will be no end to the harvest, and science and technology are improving year by year, and the harvest will also improve accordingly.

We know that Timiryazev has a famous saying: "Science should come down from its throne and speak in the language of the people." Soviet science is precisely such a science. Beloshapko said: Soviet agricultural scientists are closely integrated with production practice and closely linked with the masses of the people. The Soviet agricultural scientific research institutions and agricultural production experts are closely combined, creating many new and good working methods. These advanced working methods can be implemented in most collective farms and state farms. Soviet collective farmers have a spirit of collectivism and are not conservative; if one person or one farm creates a good experience, they will immediately and proactively spread it, and often first spread it to their opponents who are engaged in socialist competition with them. If a farm achieves a high yield using one method, many farms will soon achieve the same results, and often develop the original method to make it even better. When using these methods, they are not copied in their entirety, but are flexibly applied under scientific guidance according to different climates and soils.

Beloshapko said: In the Soviet Union, the promotion of advanced experience and science and technology is regarded as a huge task, carried out on a national scale. The Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party and the Council of Ministers have made a resolution requiring the universal promotion of the experience of advanced agricultural producers and the latest agricultural science and technology to further improve agricultural production. Due to the decision of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party and the Council of Ministers, a General Administration of Agricultural Science Popularization was established in the Ministry of Agriculture of the Soviet Union and the Ministry of Agriculture of the Ukrainian Republic, and a Bureau of Agricultural Science Popularization was established in the Ministries of Agriculture of other republics. Their basic task is to apply theorized agricultural knowledge to actual production in a planned and systematic way, and to spread new working methods to the peasant masses through various methods. Agricultural scientists often give popular science lectures to collective farmers, and the topics of the lectures are closely integrated with production, such as "On the Theory of Grassland Crop Rotation," "New Methods of Irrigating Fields," and "Mechanization of Basic Agricultural Production Processes," etc. In conjunction with these reports, relevant films are also shown. The state's film studios have specially made many films related to agricultural science and technology and advanced experience for farmers. These films have the most correct scientific ideas and are explained in the most popular language, and are very popular among the masses. In order to enable the peasant masses to have more systematic scientific knowledge, three-year non-detached from production agronomy training classes and animal husbandry training classes have been established in various collective farms. Agricultural scientists enthusiastically write teaching materials and manuals for these training classes, answer questions, and participate in class discussions ("Seminars"). Various short-term training classes with a duration of one year, half a year, and three months are also set up in various collective farms, where tractor station directors, farm agronomists, and animal husbandry experts teach specialized courses. In addition, in order to provide every farmer with the opportunity for further study, the state's agricultural science institutions have also compiled and printed a large number of correspondence course materials, allowing farmers to study at home. Academicians of the Soviet Academy of Sciences and university professors are not academic figures, they all directly participate in the work of farms, guide many farms to conduct large-scale experiments with new methods, and systematically study and summarize the good experiences created by the masses.

She also said: Not only agricultural scientists participate in the work of promoting science and technology, but also many practical workers and advanced farmers participate. In most collective farms, agricultural culture halls or laboratories have been established. It is a stronghold for popularizing and improving agricultural culture. It experiments with new production methods and new varieties, and after verification, it is widely promoted. The hall also displays the methods and achievements created by advanced producers for everyone to learn from.

From Beloshapko's conversation, we can see that the Soviet peasants are no longer people who suffer in the fields, but are gradually becoming creative scientific workers; they are no longer manipulated by nature, but are gradually becoming the masters of nature. As Michurin said: Collective farmers are different from farmers in the history of all ages and countries. They are a completely new type of farmer. They arm themselves with science and technology, fight against the natural environment miraculously, and deal with nature with the views of innovators. Beloshapko described to us the Great Stalin Plan for Transforming Nature and said: This plan is being rapidly realized, and Soviet agriculture is being further mechanized and electrified. A complete set of comprehensive agricultural science and technology concerning cultivation, breeding, fertilization, and irrigation is being promoted and developed. The ranks of agricultural technical cadres and advanced agricultural producers are expanding and improving. These are the reliable guarantees for the successful completion of the requirements for agriculture at the 19th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party.

We asked: Can you introduce your personal experience to the Chinese people? She smiled modestly and said: It's not easy to say that, let's talk about it simply.

Beloshapko's experience also clearly illustrates that Soviet culture and science belong to the people. From her simple narration, we know that this scientist, who is now sitting here talking about the achievements and advanced experience of Soviet agricultural science, was a girl who was cruelly exploited on the land of landlords and rich peasants 35 years ago. She said: I was born in 1905 into a worker's family in Ukraine. When I was ten years old, I went out to work as a hired laborer for others. The October Revolution completely changed my family and gave me the opportunity to go to school. In my youth, I was a member of the Communist Youth League and did propaganda work and agricultural science popularization work in the countryside. Later, according to my own wishes, I entered the Agricultural College named after the agricultural scientist Timiryazev. After graduating from the Agronomy Department, I stayed at the school to do postgraduate studies and obtained a Master of Agronomy degree. Now, I am the head of the Agronomy Department in the agricultural college where I originally studied. - She talked with great interest: "There are more than 1,200 students of all nationalities in my department, most of whom are children of workers and peasants, and there are also some Chinese students." - She also mentioned: Because she worked very well, the government awarded her a glorious medal; during the Patriotic War, she won the Medal for the Defense of Moscow. She said: There are many, many women like me in the Soviet Union. They are from workers and peasants or daughters of workers and peasants, and now they are engaged in scientific research, state power work, or other glorious work. Thanks to the care of the Party and Comrade Stalin, Soviet women have become a huge force. She said: "It is precisely because of the Party and Stalin that I can have such an honor - to meet the liberated Chinese people on the 35th anniversary of the October Revolution and the 'Sino-Soviet Friendship Month'. Please convey my respects to the Chinese women and the Chinese people who have contributed their strength to defending peace, and especially hope that Chinese women will be further liberated and achieve more brilliant achievements in economic construction and cultural activities." At the end of the conversation, she enthusiastically and excitedly cheered: "Long live Comrade Mao Zedong, the great leader and closest friend of the Chinese women and people! Long live Comrade Stalin, the wise mentor of progressive mankind all over the world and the builder of the world peace and democracy fortress!"

When we parted, we greeted her and thanked her for spending three hours of precious time for us. She said: "When I arrive in China, my time will be yours." A simple sentence contains such deep friendship! (Attached picture)

    苏联的农业科学是属于广大人民群众的
    ——访苏联农业科学家别洛沙普柯
    燕凌
    由千百万国营农尝集体农庄、农业机器站和农业科学研究机关所组成的苏维埃农业网，简直是一个巨大的农业科学院，也可以说是一个巨大的新型的农业大学。整个苏维埃的土地，在苏联人民——伟大的自然改造者的手里，正在变成一个遍地绿色的整洁的美丽的大花园。
    在十月革命三十五周年纪念日前的一个下午，我们访问了苏联文化工作者代表团团员、苏联蒂米利亚泽夫农业学院农学系主任、农学硕士别洛沙普柯。我们提出一些问题向她请教，像小学生一样静静地听着她的谈话；她的语言在我面前越来越清晰地变成这样一幅壮丽的图画。
    我们问：苏联的农业科学工作者、实际工作者、农民群众之间的关系是怎样的？苏联怎样科学地总结农民群众创造的先进经验？苏联在推广丰产经验和科学技术方面有些什么制度和办法？苏联的农业教育是怎样和农业生产的实际相结合的？苏联农业工作者将采取什么办法实现联共第十九次代表大会对农业方面提出的新要求？
    别洛沙普柯说：这些问题都是互相有关的，我要作一个综合的答复。首先最重要的是，列宁和斯大林的党把极为分散的小农经济逐步集中起来，使它变成了大规模的社会主义农业。社会主义农业制度给科学开辟了一条宽阔的道路。这样，农业科学研究工作和农业机器就能够充分地迅速地发挥出它们的力量来了。接着她说明了苏联的农业科学本身的性质也决定了它必然是要和实际密切结合的。苏联的世界闻名的农业科学家蒂米利亚泽夫（一八四三——一九二○）、土壤学家威廉斯（一八六三——一九三九）、生物学家米丘林（一八五五——一九三五）等，发现了土壤和生物的关系的新规律，发现了植物动物的生活和遗传的新规律，把农业科学放到了唯一正确的辩证唯物主义的基础上。他们宣告：人可以而且必须掌握自然的规律，按照人类的意愿支配自然、改造自然。在这些科学家的学说的光芒照耀下前进的苏联农业科学工作者的大军，与实际工作者、农民群众紧密结合，使许多种作物得到了越来越大的丰收，使许多种牲畜变成繁殖得更快、质量更好的品种。
    别洛沙普柯随便举出了几个例子：在西伯利亚那样自然条件不好的地方，一个集体农庄女庄员谢尔盖也娃种的春小麦，在每公顷（合中国十五市亩）土地上收获了一百零一公担（合中国二万零二百市斤）；也就是说，每亩收了一千三百四十六斤多。以“马克思”为名的集体农庄的一个生产小组长柯列基亚·格阿保夫塔种的两公顷玉米，每公顷收了二百零三公担（合中国四万零六百市斤）；也就是说，每亩收了二千七百零六斤多。“柯雷图”集体农庄的一位社会主义劳动英雄日拉也夫·伊布来伊种的十公顷稻子，每公顷收了一百六十二公担（合中国三万二千四百市斤）；也就是说，每亩收了二千一百六十市斤。莫斯科州的“斯大林”集体农庄，平均一只奶牛一年能产一万公升（公升和中国的市升相等）牛奶。她说：像这样的高额产量，在苏联各个地区、各种作物中都有。苏联每年播种的春季、冬季作物的总产量每年成亿普特（每普特合中国三十二点六七市斤）地增加。在这中间，科学工作者起了巨大的作用；先进的农业科学不是空谈，不是装饰品，而是为农业经济增加巨大财富的一支力量。别洛沙普柯谈到的苏联农业的成就，证明了威廉斯的至理名言：没有不好的土壤，只有不好的耕作技术。这也说明了：土地一旦不属于只关心私人的利润而属于只关心全体人民的幸福的社会主义国家，它的生产力是无穷无尽的。别洛沙普柯用坚定而有力的声调说：收成是不会有止境的，年年科学技术都在提高，收成也就会随着提高起来。
    我们知道，蒂米利亚泽夫有一句名言：“科学应该从它的宝座上走下来，并且用人民的语言说话。”苏联的科学正是这样的科学。别洛沙普柯说：苏联的农业科学工作者是和生产实践密切结合的，是和人民群众密切联系的。苏联的农业科学研究机关和农业生产能手紧密结合，创造了许多新的好的工作方法。这些先进工作方法在大部分集体农庄，国营农场都能推行。苏联集体农民是有集体主义精神的，不保守的；一个人、一个农庄创造了好的经验，就马上主动地传播开去，而且往往首先传播给正和他们进行社会主义竞赛的对手。一个农庄用一种方法丰产了，不久许多农庄也就都得到了同样的成绩，而且往往又发展了原来的方法，使它更加完善。各地运用这些方法时也不是原封搬运的，而是在科学的指导下按照不同的气候和土壤灵活地运用。
    别洛沙普柯说：在苏联，推广先进经验和科学技术是被当作一个巨大的任务，在全国的规模上进行着的。联共中央和部长会议曾经作出决议，要求普遍推广农业先进生产者的经验和最新的农业科学技术，以促使农业生产进一步地提高。由于联共中央和部长会议的决定，在全苏农业部和乌克兰共和国农业部各设了一个农业科学普及总局，在其他共和国的农业部设了农业科学普及局。它们的基本任务是有计划地有系统地把理论化了的农业知识应用到实际生产中去，把新工作方法通过各种方式传播到农民群众中去。农业科学工作者经常向集体农民作通俗的科学讲演，讲演的题目是和生产密切结合的，如“关于草田轮作制的学说”、“灌溉田地的新方法”、“农业生产基本过程的机械化”等等。配合这些报告，还放映有关的电影。国家的电影制片厂特别为农民拍制了许多有关农业科学技术和先进经验的影片，这些影片有最正确的科学思想，用最通俗的语言解说，很受群众欢迎。为了使农民群众有更系统化的科学知识，各集体农庄都设立了三年制的不脱离生产的农艺训练班和畜牧训练班。农业科学工作者非常热心地为这些训练班写教材、编手册、解答问题，参加课堂讨论（“习明纳尔”）。各集体农庄还设有以一年、半年、三个月为期的各种短期训练班，由拖拉机站主任、农庄的农学家、畜牧专家讲专门的课程。此外，为了每个农民都有进修的机会，国家的农业科学机关还编印了大量的函授教材，让农民在家里也可以进修。苏联的科学院院士、大学教授都不是学院式的人物，他们都直接参加农场的工作，指导许多农庄大规模地进行新方法的实验，有系统地研究和总结群众创造的好经验。
    她还说：不仅农业科学工作者参加推广科学技术的工作，许多实际工作者和先进的农民也参加。在大部分集体农庄中，都建立了农业文化馆或实验室。它是普及和提高农业文化的据点。它实验新的生产方法，新的品种，核定以后就普遍推广。在馆里还陈列着先进生产者创造的方法和成绩，供大家学习。
    从别洛沙普柯的谈话中，我们可以看到，苏联的农民，不再是在田地上受苦的人，而渐渐成为有创造性的科学工作者；不再是被自然摆弄来摆弄去的，而渐渐成了大自然的主人。正如米丘林所说的：集体农民和各时代各国家的历史上的农民都不相同，他们是一种完全新型的农民，他们用科学技术把自己武装起来，奇迹似地和自然环境作斗争，用革新者的见解对付自然。别洛沙普柯向我们描述了伟大的斯大林改造自然计划之后说：这计划正在迅速地实现着，而且苏联农业正在进一步机械化，电气化，关于耕作、育种、施肥、灌溉的一整套综合性的农业科学技术正在推广着、发展着，农业技术干部和农业先进生产者的队伍正在扩大着、提高着。这些就是联共第十九次代表大会对农业方面的要求能够胜利完成的可靠的保证。
    我们问：能不能向中国人民介绍一下您个人的经历呢？她谦虚地笑着说：这不大好说，简单地谈谈吧。
    别洛沙普柯的经历也鲜明地说明了：苏联的文化科学是属于人民的。从她的简单叙述中，我们知道：现在坐在这里畅谈苏联农业科学的成就和先进经验的这位科学家，在三十五年以前却是一个在地主、富农的土地上受着残酷的压榨的女孩子。她说：一九零五年，我生在乌克兰一个工人的家庭里。十来岁的时候，就出去给人家当雇工。十月革命使我的家庭完全变了样，使我有了进学校读书的机会。在青年时代，我是一个共产主义青年团团员，在农村中做过宣传工作和农业科学普及工作。后来，按照自己的志愿进了以农业科学家蒂米利亚泽夫为名的农业学院。在农学系毕业后，留校做研究生，得到了农学硕士的学位。现在，就在我原来读书的这个农业学院做农学系主任。——她非常有兴趣地谈到：“我那个系里有各民族的学生一千二百多人，大多数是工人农民的子弟，其中还有一些中国留学生。”——她还谈到：因为她工作得很好，政府颁发给她一个光荣奖章；在卫国战争年代，她获得了保卫莫斯科奖章。她说：像我这样的女性，在苏联是很多很多的。她们出身工农或者是工人农民的女儿，现在参加了科学研究工作、国家政权工作或者其他光荣的工作。由于党和斯大林同志的关怀，苏联妇女成为一支巨大的力量。她说：“也正是因为有了党和斯大林，我才能有这样的光荣——在这十月革命三十五周年和‘中苏友好月’的日子和解放了的中国人民见面。请向在保卫和平中献出了自己的力量的中国妇女和中国人民转达我的敬意，特别希望中国妇女进一步得到解放并在经济建设和文化活动中得到更光辉的成就。”谈到最后，她热情地兴奋地欢呼起来：“中国妇女和人民的伟大领袖和最知己的朋友毛泽东同志万岁！全世界进步人类的英明导师、世界和平民主堡垒的建筑者斯大林同志万岁！”
    离别时，我们向她致意，感谢她为我们用去了三个钟头珍贵的时间。她说：“我到了中国，我的时间就是你们的了。”简单的一句话，包含了多么深厚的友情！（附图片）
