    My Job is Guaranteed
    Comrade Editor: My name is Jia Zhenfa. I used to be an unemployed worker, but now I am a salesperson at the Beijing Department Store. I want to tell you about my inner joy. My family was originally poor peasants. Forced by life, I came to Beijing at the age of twelve to be an apprentice in a silk thread shop, living a life like a beast of burden, working eighteen hours a day. I remember once when I was working the night shift, I was hungry and wanted to eat a corn bun, but the shopkeeper saw me and slapped me in the face. Another time, I went to fetch water for the shopkeeper at night, and because I was too tired from work and didn't get enough sleep, I fell asleep by the water tank while fetching water. As a result, I was beaten by the shopkeeper again. In winter, my hands and feet were so frozen that they bled, and I couldn't even get a pair of shoes to wear. Let's not talk about it anymore, there's no end to the suffering. After "graduating" from the apprenticeship, I continued to suffer hardship and persecution, not to mention the threat of unemployment. A long string of bitter days passed, and finally I looked forward to liberation, with a real trade union, and our working hours were shortened. In May of this year, I became unemployed due to industry adjustments. I knew it was temporary, but I always had a somewhat heavy feeling in my heart. After the People's Government let me participate in the Beijing Chongwen District Unemployed Workers Study Class, that temporary heavy feeling disappeared. After the Central People's Government Council of Administration's "Decision on Labor Employment Issues" was announced, on September 1st we were transferred to the Beijing Unemployed Workers Retraining Class for study. Soon I was assigned to the fourth branch of the Beijing Department Store as a salesperson. My job is guaranteed. I continue to study while I work. Now I have put on new clothes. In addition to living expenses, I can save a portion of my salary to the People's Bank every month. How delighted I am! This was something I couldn't even dream of before liberation. In the future, I guarantee to use practical actions to do my job well to welcome my new life, to thank Chairman Mao and the People's Government.

    我的职业有了保证
    编辑同志：我叫贾振发。我本是一个失业工人，但现在我已经是北京市百货公司的售货员了。我要把我内心的愉快情绪告诉你。我家原是贫农，迫于生活，我从十二岁起就来北京做丝线铺的学徒，过那牛马般的每天工作十八小时的日子。记得有一次上夜班，我肚子饿想吃个窝窝头，被掌柜看见了，他便打了我一个耳光。还有一次夜里，我去给掌柜打水，因为工作得太累了，睡觉又不够，所以打水时就爬在水缸边睡着了。结果我又被掌柜打了一顿。冬天，我的手脚冻得冒鲜血，也得不到一双鞋子穿。不再说了吧，那些苦头是说不完的。“出师”以后，继续受苦受迫害不必说，还要受着失业的威胁。一长串苦日子挨过去了，好容易盼到了解放，有了真正的工会，我们的工时才缩短了。今年五月，我因行业调整而失业了。我明知道那是暂时的，但内心总或多或少有着沉重的感觉。人民政府让我参加北京市崇文区失业工人学习班后，我那一时的沉重的感觉消除了。中央人民政府政务院“关于劳动就业问题的决定”公布后，九月一日我们又被调到北京市失业工人转业训练班学习。很快地我就被分配到北京市百货公司第四门市部当售货员。我的职业有了保证。我一面工作一面继续学习。现在我已经穿上新衣服。我的工资，除了生活费用外，每月还可以剩下一部分存到人民银行。我是多么欣喜！这在解放以前真是做梦也梦不到的事。今后我保证用做好工作的实际行动来迎接我的新生活，以答谢毛主席、人民政府。
