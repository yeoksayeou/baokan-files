    In Our Country's Economic Construction, the Soviet Union's Advanced Experience and Technology Play a Significant Role
    Over the past three years, the Soviet Union's advanced experience and technology have played a significant role in our country's economic construction. Combined with the creativity and labor enthusiasm of our country's working class, it is accelerating the process of our country's industrialization.
    The construction of modern new factories, new mines, as well as new railways, ports, and agricultural, forestry, and water conservancy projects, is decisive for the speed of our country's economic construction and industrialization. Because of the importance attached to learning from the Soviet Union's advanced socialist experience from the very beginning, our country's capital construction is advancing at an accelerated pace. Geological exploration is the primary link in capital construction. In this regard, excellent results have been achieved by learning the Soviet "rapid drilling method." After the Ma Wenzhi team of the Fuxin Mining Bureau successfully learned the "rapid drilling method," the average drilling efficiency increased by nearly three times. The "rapid drilling method" provides a shortcut for our country's upcoming large-scale geological drilling work, and it will play a huge role in promoting the development of the ferrous metal, coal, and non-ferrous metal mining industries. Correct design is an important task to ensure the quality and safety of capital construction projects and save state investment. The Northeast People's Government's Ministry of Industry has formulated "Provisional Standards for Structural Design of Buildings" based on Soviet advanced technical specifications. According to this new standard, the state can save a lot of materials and funds. For example, after the Civil Architecture Design Company of the Northeast Industrial Department designed according to the new standard, it can save the state about 10 billion yuan this year in concrete alone. Civil engineering is a very large and time-consuming part of capital construction. The Soviet Union's advanced experience in this area has increasingly demonstrated its great value. The nationally renowned Su Changyou bricklaying team, using the Soviet Union's advanced "sectional continuous bricklaying method" and "Savelyevkin two-handed mortar squeezing method," has rapidly increased bricklaying efficiency by four times. After the Su Changyou team's bricklaying method was promoted nationwide, it triggered many new reforms and innovations in carpentry, plastering, caulking, concrete work, and the entire construction project. It has transformed the original scattered individual labor into a collective operation with scientific division of labor, greatly shortening the construction time of new projects and accelerating the training of a large number of skilled workers, preparing important conditions for civil engineering in large-scale capital construction. In other work such as machine installation, the Soviet Union's advanced experience has also shown its superiority.
    In the newly built Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, Tianshui-Lanzhou Railway, Tanggu New Port, and the Huai River control and Jingjiang flood diversion projects, the help of the Soviet Union's advanced experience is very significant. For example, in railway new line projects, due to learning from the Soviet Union's mountain road construction experience, especially such as "layered filling and tamping method," not only is the track laying process shortened, but also the quality of the railway is greatly improved.
    Over the past three years, the recovery, transformation, and development of our country's industry, agriculture, and transportation have also been greatly helped by the Soviet Union's advanced experience.
    The "economic accounting system" unique to the socialist Soviet Union has been designated as the basic principle of management and operation of people's enterprises since liberation. The implementation of the "economic accounting system" can not only highly promote the enthusiasm of enterprise management, but also realize the state's highly centralized planned management, ensuring the accumulation of funds for our country's industrialization. The "economic accounting system" has been promoted in our country's railways and state-owned industrial and mining enterprises, and is currently beginning to be promoted in state-owned farms. In 1951, state-owned industrial and mining enterprises saved a large amount of working capital for the state simply by implementing the first step of the "economic accounting system" - clearing assets and verifying funds. The People's Railway has fundamentally changed the situation of railways losing money year after year during the Kuomintang rule because it has focused on promoting the economic accounting system for the past three years. It has overfulfilled the state's transportation tasks and financial income tasks, accumulating huge amounts of funds for the state. The effectiveness of the "economic accounting system" is also clearly reflected in the increasing proportion of state-owned enterprises' profits turned over to the state in our country's fiscal revenue. Although the implementation of the "economic accounting system" is still only a beginning in the country, its great value will definitely become increasingly apparent in the future.
    The Soviet Union's advanced production technology plays a significant role in improving the production efficiency of our country's industry, agriculture, and transportation. Many industrial systems have changed their past backward semi-colonial production appearance due to the promotion of the Soviet Union's advanced technical experience. For example, the "new coal mining method" not only provides conditions for safe production, but also generally increases the coal recovery rate from 30% to 75%, and the full-staff efficiency of coal mining increases by nearly one time. The "high-speed cutting method" has generally increased the production efficiency of various machine tools in our country by four to five times, thus greatly advancing the productivity of our country's machining. Currently, the highest cutting speed has reached 1,507 meters per minute, an increase of nearly 30 times compared to before. In agriculture, the Soviet Union's advanced farming methods and cropping systems, such as "deep plowing, close planting, pruning," "dry direct seeding of rice," and "pasture field rotation system," also greatly help our country's agriculture fully cultivate and utilize land fertility and increase yield per unit area. For example, after the Shuangqiao Practice Farm implemented the advanced farming method of "deep plowing, close planting, pruning," the average yield of seed cotton per mu increased from 34 jin in 1949 to 296 jin in 1951, and this year it has increased to 350 jin to 400 jin. After the close planting method is adopted in wheat producing areas, the yield per mu can also be doubled. According to the results of the trial implementation of "dry direct seeding of rice" in the Lutai State Farm, the average yield of 13,000 mu of rice can reach 700 jin per mu, of which 30 mu of high-yield land reaches more than 1,500 jin per mu. In addition, such as "open hearth fast steelmaking method" and "blast furnace full wind fast charging smooth operation method" in the steel industry, "fast repair method" in the power industry, "single-row towing method" in the shipping system, and the experience of "500 daily vehicle kilometers" in the railway system, all play a significant role in realizing the potential for production, thereby achieving increased production, improved quality, reduced costs, and improved technical level of employees.
    Adapting to the improvement of production technology, the advanced experience in production organization and management methods of the Soviet Union has begun to greatly change the face of our country's state-owned enterprises. In units that implement "organized rhythmic production according to instruction charts" in the machine manufacturing industry, various departments coordinate and operate rhythmically as precisely as a clock, so that production reaches a new and higher balance on the basis of breaking through the original level of efficiency in certain types of work, providing a strong guarantee for completing and exceeding the production plan. For example, as a result of promoting this advanced experience in the Northeast Third Machine Factory, it has been able to complete the national production plan evenly every month since April this year, and both output and quality have been significantly improved. Similarly, the "cyclic production time chart system" promoted in the coal mining industry and the "tight operation chart" promoted in the railway system are consistent with the spirit of this advanced experience.
    Socialist countries not only attach importance to science and technology and machines, but also attach importance to the people who master science and technology and machines. The "production responsibility system" unique to the Soviet Union is the best experience to give play to the sense of responsibility of the workers as masters. After this system is universally promoted in our country's state-owned enterprises, it quickly changes the phenomenon of no one being responsible left over from the old enterprises. The "rationalization proposal" that has formed a mass movement has greatly stimulated the creative wisdom and enthusiasm for building the motherland of our country's workers and technicians. Tens of thousands of rationalization proposals related to improving tools, operating methods, labor organization, and the entire production management work are constantly emerging in various enterprise departments, making significant contributions to production. The "Kovalev working method" provides the best method for concentrating mass wisdom and discovering advanced experience and advanced technology. After preliminarily learning this experience, the textile industry summarized the well-known "1951 weaving method," and labor model Jiang Wanshou created the "summer clothing unified operation method," which has achieved great results in improving work efficiency.
    The experience of the Soviet Union's 35 years of economic construction was improved and created on the basis of critically absorbing the science and technology of capitalist countries, is armed with Marxist-Leninist thought, and is the most advanced and scientific experience in the world. Undoubtedly, with the help of these advanced experiences, the beautiful prospect of the new China's industrialization will surely arrive ahead of schedule.  (Xinhua News Agency)

    在我国经济建设事业中
    苏联先进经验和先进技术发挥重大作用
    苏联先进经验和先进技术三年来在我国经济建设事业中发挥了重大作用，它和我国工人阶级的创造性、劳动热情结合起来，正加速着我国工业化的进程。
    建设现代化的新工厂、新矿山以及新的铁路、港口、农林水利事业等，对于我国经济建设的速度和工业化的速度来说是决定性的事情。由于一开头就重视学习苏联社会主义的先进经验，我国的基本建设正在加快步伐前进。基本建设中地质勘察是首要的环节，在这方面由于学习了苏联的“快速钻探法”，已表现优异的成绩。阜新矿务局马文志小组学习“快速钻探法”成功后，平均钻探效率提高将近三倍。“快速钻探法”给我国即将大规模进行的地质钻探工作提供了捷径，它对于黑色金属、煤炭和有色金属采掘业的发展，将起巨大的推动作用。正确的设计是保证基本建设工程质量和安全，节约国家投资的一项重要工作。东北人民政府工业部根据苏联的先进技术规范制订了“建筑物结构设计暂行标准”。根据这个新标准，可以为国家节约大量的材料和资金。如东北工业部土木建筑设计公司按照新标准进行设计后，仅混凝土一项，今年就能为国家节约一百亿元左右。基本建设中土木工程是很浩大很费时间的。苏联的先进经验在这方面已日益显示出它的巨大价值。全国著名的苏长有砌砖小组，运用苏联先进的“分段连续砌砖法”和“沙夫留金双手挤浆法”，使砌砖效率迅速提高四倍；苏长有小组的砌砖法在全国推广后引起了木工、抹灰工、抅缝工、混凝土工等工种和整个建筑工程上许多新的改革和创造。它使原来分散的个体劳动改变为有科学分工的集体操作，大大缩短了新建工程的施工时间，并且加速培养出大批技术工人，为大规模基本建设的土木工程准备了重要的条件。其他在机器安装等工作上，苏联先进经验也同样显示出它的优越性。
    在新建的成渝铁路、天兰铁路、塘沽新港和治淮、荆江分洪等巨大工程中，苏联先进经验的帮助都是很大的。如铁路新线工程，由于学习了苏联的山地筑路经验，特别如“分层填土打夯法”等，不只铺轨过程缩短，并且铁路的质量也大为提高。
    三年多来，我国工业、农业和运输业的恢复、改造和发展，也取得了苏联先进经验的巨大帮助。
    社会主义苏联特有的“经济核算制”，解放以后即被定为人民企业经营管理的基本原则。实行“经济核算制”，既能高度发扬企业经营的积极性，又能实现国家高度集中的计划管理，使我国工业化资金的积累得到有力保证。“经济核算制”已在我国铁路及国营工矿企业中推行，目前并开始推行到国营农场中去。一九五一年各国营工矿企业仅仅在实行“经济核算制”的第一步——清理资产、核定资金的工作中，就为国家节约了大量的流动资金。人民铁道由于三年来重点推行了经济核算制，就超额完成了国家的运输任务和财务收入任务，根本改变了国民党统治时期铁路年年亏本的情况，为国家积累了巨额的资金。“经济核算制”的成效从我国财政收入中国营企业利润上缴比重的增长上，也清楚地反映出来。“经济核算制”的实行在全国虽还只是开端，但它的巨大价值在今后一定会日益显示出来。
    苏联的先进生产技术对于我国工业、农业和运输业生产效率的提高，起显著的作用。许多产业系统由于推广苏联先进技术经验，已经改变了过去落后的半殖民地化的生产面貌。如“新采煤法”不但提供了安全生产的条件，而且使煤的回采率普遍由百分之三十提高到百分之七十五，采煤的全员效率提高将近一倍。“高速切削法”使我国各种机床的生产效能普遍提高四倍到五倍，因而使我国机械加工生产率大大跃进一步。目前最高的切削速度已经达到每分钟一千五百零七公尺，较前提高近三十倍。在农业方面，苏联先进的耕作方法和农作制度如“深耕、密植、整枝”、“水稻旱直播”“牧草大田轮作制”等，也大大地帮助我国农业充分培养和利用地力，提高单位面积产量。例如国营双桥实习农场实行“深耕、密植、整枝”的先进耕作方法后，每亩籽棉的平均产量由一九四九年的三十四斤提高到一九五一年的二百九十六斤，今年又提高到三百五十斤到四百斤。小麦产地采用密植法后，每亩产量亦可增加一倍。根据国营芦台农场试行“水稻旱直播”的结果，一万三千亩水稻的平均产量可达每亩七百斤，其中有三十亩丰产地达到每亩一千五百斤以上。此外如钢铁工业中的“平炉快速炼钢法”、“高炉全风快料顺行法”，电力工业中的“快速检修法”，航运系统中的“一列式拖带法”，铁路系统中的“五百日车公里”的经验等，对于发挥生产潜在能力，从而达到增加产量、改进质量、降低成本、提高职工技术水平，都起了重大作用。
    适应着生产技术的提高，苏联的生产组织和管理方法上的先进经验已开始使我国国营企业的面貌大大改观。机器制造工业实行“按指示图表组织有节奏生产”的单位中，各部门协调地像钟表那样精确地有节奏地动作，使生产在某些工种效率突破原有水平的基础上，达到了新的更高的平衡，给完成与超过生产计划提供了有力保证。如东北第三机器厂推行这个先进经验的结果，今年四月份起每月就都能均衡地完成国家生产计划，产量和质量都得到显著提高。同样地，煤矿工业中推行的“循环生产时间图表制”和在铁路系统中推行的“紧密运行图”，都是和这一先进经验的精神一致的。
    社会主义国家不仅重视科学技术和机器，而且重视掌握科学技术和机器的人，苏联所特有的“生产责任制”就是发挥职工主人翁责任感的最好的经验，这个制度在我国国营企业中普遍推行后，迅速地改变了旧企业所遗留下来的无人负责的现象。已形成群众性运动的“合理化建议”大大地激发了我国工人和技术人员的创造智慧和建设祖国的热情。成千成万有关改进工具、操作方法、劳动组织和整个生产管理工作的合理化建议，在各个企业部门不断涌现出来，对生产作了重大的贡献。“郭瓦廖夫工作方法”更给集中群众智慧和发现先进经验、先进技术提供了最好的方法。初步学习这一经验后，纺织工业中总结出了闻名的“一九五一织布工作法”，劳动模范姜万寿创造了“夏服统一操作法”，对于提高工作效率都取得了很大的成效。
    苏联三十五年来经济建设的经验，是在批判吸收资本主义各国科学技术的基础上提高和创造出来的，是用马克思列宁主义思想武装起来的，是世界上最先进的最科学的经验。无疑地，获得了这些先进经验的帮助，新中国工业化的美丽远景一定会提前到来。   （新华社）
