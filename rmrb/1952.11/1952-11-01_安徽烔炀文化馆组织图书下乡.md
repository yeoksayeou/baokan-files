    Anhui Tongyang Cultural Center Organizes Book Distribution to the Countryside

    To the Editor:
    The Tongyang People's Cultural Center in Anhui Province, adhering to the policy of serving the countryside, has been conducting book distribution to the countryside in a planned and systematic manner.

    We organize "book distribution to the countryside" in the following ways: First, we establish "mobile book groups" in larger villages, with one group leader responsible for lending books. Since 1952, we have established 27 groups in the three townships of Shanqiao, Jizhong, and Xinmin, each group equipped with 30 to 60 books (comic books accounting for two-thirds). They circulate every seven days in turn (the masses mostly request circulation every half month). Thanks to the help of village cadres, the books are all borrowed as soon as they arrive. Second, based on mutual aid teams, we mobilize farmers with a certain level of education to form "reading groups" for systematic reading. On the principle of voluntary participation by the masses, we have successively established 65 groups with a total of 356 members. Each person can borrow one book at a time and exchange books with each other. Third, we strive for the help of primary school and agricultural school teachers. For example, the five mobile book groups in Shanqiao Township were initially set up by teachers. They first used the method of teaching apprentices, and now they have been handed over to the farmers themselves to manage. As for teachers, we individually issue them library cards (93 people), and each person can borrow three books at a time. In addition to reading themselves, they also lend them to farmers. Fourth, in remote villages, we establish "book lending points" or "book service stations." We have now established five such points, each station being managed and books being lent by a person elected by the masses. This solves the difficulty of borrowing books for the masses in remote areas. For example, Huang Youwen, a farmer from Huangwa Village, Sima Township, 20 miles away from the cultural center, said: "Since the establishment of the book lending point, we don't have to travel far to borrow books, which is very convenient. Chairman Mao takes care of everything!"

    Several years of work have proven that organizing book distribution to the countryside is a way to connect with the masses and is an important working method for our rural cultural centers. At the beginning, only more than 500 books from the Tongyang Cultural Center were circulating in the countryside every day. After the establishment of the mobile groups, the number of books distributed to the countryside increased to 1,723. Our work has also proven that the combination of reading groups and farmers' production mutual aid teams is an effective way to solve the problem of farmers having time to read and study during the busy farming season. Because after the mobile book groups distribute the books evenly to the mutual aid teams in the whole village, the team members can take the books to the fields and read them during breaks. Another point is that when books arrive in each group, popular comic books are always borrowed first by the masses. Farmers reflect that "there are too few comic books, not enough to read." This shows that in order for books to be welcomed by the masses, we must understand the needs of the masses when allocating books, and at the same time pay attention to the content being easy to understand. We must constantly accept the opinions of the masses and improve our work.

    安徽烔炀文化馆组织图书下乡
    编辑同志：安徽省烔炀人民文化馆，本着面向农村的方针，有计划有步骤地开展了图书下乡的工作。
    我们组织“图书下乡”的方式有下列几种：一、在较大的村庄，建立“图书流动组”，每组设组长一人，负责出借图书。从一九五二年起我们先后在山桥、济众、新民等三乡建立了二十七个组，每组都配有三十至六十本的图书（连环画占三分之二）。每七天依次流动一次（群众多要求每半月流动一次）。由于取得了村干部的帮助，书一到就被借得光光的。二、在互助组的基础上，发动具有一定文化程度的农民组成“读书小组”，有系统地进行阅读。在群众自愿的原则下，先后建立了六十五个组，组员共有三百五十六人。每人每次可借一本书，并可互相交换阅读。三、争取小学和农校教师的帮助。如山桥乡五个图书流动组，起先就是由教师们搞起来的。他们先是用教徒弟的方式，现在已移交给农民们自己搞了。至于教师，我们个别发给借书证（有九十三人），每人每次可借三本书。他们除自己进行阅读外，还借给农民看。四、在路远的乡村，成立“借书处”或“图书服务站”。现已成立五处，每处每站都由群众推选一人负责管理和出借图书。这样就解决了路远的群众借书的困难。如离文化馆二十里的驷马乡黄洼村农民黄有文说：“自借书处成立后，我们借书不用跑路了，方便得很。毛主席样样都照顾的周到！”
    几年来的工作证明组织图书下乡是联系群众的工作方式，是我们农村文化馆的重要的工作方法。烔炀文化馆的图书开始时每天只有五百多本书在乡村中流动，成立流动组之后，下乡的图书增到一千七百二十三本。我们的工作也证明了，读书小组和农民生产互助组的互相结合，是解决农民在农忙时能有时间看书学习的有效办法。因为图书流动组把图书平分给全村互助组以后，组员们便可以把书带下田去，利用休息时间进行阅读。还有一点，图书到各组时，通俗的连环画册总是先被群众借完，农民们反映说：“连环画册太少，不够看”。由此可见，要使图书受到群众欢迎，在调配图书时必须了解群众的要求，同时要注意内容的通俗。我们一定要不断接受群众的意见，改进工作。    何竟成
