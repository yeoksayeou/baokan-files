    An Advanced New-Type Village—Xigou Village
    Chen Jie, Man Hui, Xian Fu
    Formerly a Barren and Impoverished Mountain Village
    Xigou Village in Pingshun, Shanxi, was originally a barren and impoverished mountain village. Its fifty-one households, totaling two hundred and thirty-seven people, were scattered across nine natural villages. The four hundred and seventy-three mu of cultivated land were divided into more than two thousand plots, of which terraced fields accounted for over sixty percent. Before the War of Resistance Against Japan, sixty percent of the village's land was controlled by landlords and rich peasants who accounted for less than six percent of the village's population. The peasants toiled all year round but could not achieve basic sustenance, living a life of hardship with "bran and vegetables for half the year." In 1943, the Japanese invaders carried out brutal burning, killing, and looting here, killing seventeen people with labor power, burning down half the houses, destroying one-third of the farm tools, and driving away seven head of livestock. Production was severely damaged, and the lives of the peasants became even more painful.
    The leadership of the Communist Party enabled the people of Xigou Village to forever escape disaster and suffering. Responding to the Party's call, the people of Xigou Village actively fought against the enemy, implemented rent and interest reduction, land reform, and mutual aid in production, finally transforming a remote and poor mountain gully into an advanced new-type village.
    Embarking on the Road of Cooperativization
    As early as 1943, under the leadership of Li Shunda, the secretary of the CCP branch and a model worker, the peasants of Xigou Village, following Chairman Mao's instruction to "get organized," organized mutual aid teams. Over the past ten years, the village's mutual aid teams have been developing and consolidating. The development of the rural economy and the improvement of production conditions have made the peasants feel that the mutual aid teams, with their collective labor and decentralized management, could no longer meet the needs of further expanding reproduction, and they demanded that the form of labor organization be raised to a higher level. In the winter of 1951, the Party branch, based on the Li Shunda mutual aid team, led twenty-one peasant households to form an agricultural, forestry, and animal husbandry production cooperative. Now, out of the village's fifty-one households, only three households without labor power have not joined the cooperative (they are also preparing to join). The village's supply and marketing cooperative has also seen new developments, and all farmers over the age of sixteen have joined the supply and marketing cooperative. The supply of their production and living materials and the sale of agricultural products are almost entirely the responsibility of the supply and marketing cooperative. This autumn, the supply and marketing cooperative added credit services, absorbing the farmers' scattered funds for investment in production. The entire village has embarked on a comprehensive cooperativization path of integrated development of production, supply and marketing, and credit cooperatives.
    Due to the implementation of mutual aid and cooperation, the production of Xigou Village has developed year by year, and the farmers' production technology and investment strength have continuously improved. Since 1949, in terms of basic land construction and technological improvements, the village has built four hundred and sixty-eight zhang of collapsed embankments; leveled sixty-five mu of land using the method of internal cutting and external padding; turned twenty-one mu of sloping land into terraced fields; and repaired eleven mu of river滩 land. Ten water storage ponds have been dug; the cultivated land area has been expanded by thirty-eight mu. In 1950, the average application of fertilizer was eighty-five dan per mu, last year it was an average of one hundred dan, and this year it is one hundred and twenty-five dan. Fertilization is carried out three times a year according to the needs of crop development. This year, deep plowing was carried out on fifty-five percent of the cultivated land using new-style walking plows. The number of cultivations has increased from two to three or four times. Last year, improved varieties were promoted on more than eighty percent of all land, and this year, all major autumn crops are planted with improved varieties. This year, the Soviet Union's advanced experience of rational close planting was also promoted, increasing the number of corn plants from one thousand to one thousand five hundred per mu, and millet plants from fifteen thousand to over twenty thousand per mu; and three seedling fixings were implemented to ensure complete seedling emergence. In terms of production investment, according to a survey of twenty-six households, investment in 1949 accounted for twenty-seven percent of total expenditure, last year it accounted for fifty-two percent, and this year it accounts for fifty-seven percent.
    The collective ideology of the village's farmers has gradually increased, and socialist public property has expanded year by year. At present, the village has a total of six hundred and fourteen public sheep, twenty-five head of livestock, seventeen pigs, and one hundred and thirty-three pieces of various new and old farm tools. These public properties are worth about one hundred million yuan, equivalent to the total agricultural income of the entire village for one year.
    Agriculture, Forestry, and Animal Husbandry are Developing
    Mutual aid and cooperation have enabled the agricultural, forestry, and animal husbandry industries of Xigou Village to develop rapidly.
    In 1950, the total value of various crop income was 81.2 million yuan. In 1951, the total income value was 87.52 million yuan. It is estimated that the total output value this year can reach 100.23 million yuan, an increase of 2.3 times compared to the pre-war period, exceeding 54.6 percent compared to 1949. The increase in yield per unit area is even more obvious. In 1950, the average harvest per mu was 345 jin, in 1951 it was 370 jin, and this year it is 419 jin.
    The farmers of Xigou Village have correctly implemented the policy of developing production in mountainous areas. In the past three years, they have cooperatively afforested 530 mu, with a survival rate of about 70 percent. Five thousand seven hundred and fifty-two trees have been planted, of which more than half are dried fruit trees and fruit trees. The original 650 mu of forest mountains have all been pruned. A half-mu nursery has also been newly opened. If the forest area can be planned and technical management can be strengthened, and attention can be paid to grafting, the entire gully can be greened in the next few years. At that time, the production of fruit trees will become the main income of the farmers in Xigou Village.
    In terms of animal husbandry, in 1949 there were 49 head of livestock and 115 sheep. Over the past three years, through breeding and purchasing, livestock has increased rapidly. There are now 72 head of livestock such as mules, horses, donkeys, and cattle, 614 sheep, and 23 pigs. The total value of the above is 92.32 million yuan, an increase of 41.7 percent compared to 1949. Eighty percent of the livestock are female animals, and there are breeding animals such as cattle and donkeys. As long as they are carefully fed, the animal husbandry industry can be developed on a large scale.
    Farmers' Incomes Increase Year by Year
    With the rapid development of production, the incomes of the farmers in Xigou Village have increased year by year. In 1951, there were 39 households with surplus grain in the village, accounting for more than 70 percent of the total number of households. Therefore, the lives of the masses have been significantly improved. In the past three years, 45 new houses and 3 cave dwellings have been built in the village. Including those built before 1949, the houses destroyed by the Japanese invaders have been basically restored. Three years ago, the vast majority of farmers relied on weaving their own homespun cloth for clothing. In 1949, only four households in the village bought more than forty chi of commercially produced cloth. But since last year, the situation has been very different. According to the statistics of the village's supply and marketing cooperative from the end of last year to September this year, a total of 1,625 chi of commercially produced cloth (an average of 31 chi per household) were supplied to the cooperative members. Before the war, farmers ate an average of six dou of coarse grains per person per year. In 1949, they ate an average of two shi and one dou per person, and in 1951 they ate an average of three shi and seven sheng per person, an increase of four times compared to before the War of Resistance. When farmers describe the changes in their lives, they say: Before the war, it was "thin soup and vegetables for everyday meals, eating a meal of millet was like celebrating the New Year." Three years ago, it was "yellow cakes, millet rice, eating a meal of white flour was rare." Now it is "rice and flour life has become varied, oil, salt, seasoning, vinegar and sauce are added." They also said: "In the past, we didn't mind if rice was bland, now we pay attention to the fragrance and sweetness when we eat." Now every family lights kerosene lamps, saving sesame oil to improve their meals. But the farmers of Xigou Village are not satisfied with this. They say: "Good days have just begun, and even better days are ahead. We will strive for the transition to a socialist society under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao."
    The Era of No Culture is About to Pass
    In the past, there was no elementary school in Xigou Village at all. Only four people in the village had a rudimentary knowledge of writing. Farmers everywhere felt the difficulty of not being able to read. In 1948, the construction of an elementary school began, and everyone saw this as a great happy event, and sent their children to school as soon as it opened. In the past three years, twelve people have graduated from junior primary school, of which ten have continued their studies, one has been admitted to junior high school, and nine have entered senior primary school.
    In 1950, two year-round people's schools were established in the village, divided into cultural classes and general classes. People who knew more characters entered the cultural class, and illiterates entered the general class. All adults in the village have been enrolled in school. The twenty-nine people in the cultural class all have a complete set of stationery and some books, and some people have even bought fountain pens. In July this year, a rapid literacy campaign was launched in the village. After twenty-seven days of learning, ten of the forty-one illiterate or poorly literate adults in the village have learned 2,500 characters, eight have learned 2,000 characters, nineteen have learned about 1,500 characters, and four have learned about 1,000 characters. At the graduation ceremony for the rapid literacy class students on July 25, they also formulated a plan to consolidate and improve their learning achievements. They are preparing to eliminate all illiteracy by the end of this year. Now every student always has a book with them and studies whenever they have time. The era of no culture in Xigou Village is coming to an end.
    In 1950, a small library was established in the village. The library has a total of 375 kinds of books and pictures on science and technology, maternal and child health, Soviet picture libraries, and anti-US aggression and aid Korea small series. Since the launch of the rapid literacy campaign, even more people have been borrowing books and newspapers, and the newspaper reading group has become even more active. At present, the village subscribes to three copies of the Shanxi Daily, two copies of the Shanxi Pictorial, six copies of the Shanxi Peasant Newspaper, and one copy each of the Shanxi Youth Newspaper, the People's Daily, and the Children's Newspaper. They have established a system of regular newspaper reading, and the production team is also a newspaper reading team. In August this year, a radio was installed in the village, which regularly listens to current affairs, political news, and broadcasts of advanced experiences in production. This has added new content to the political and cultural life of the village's farmers.
    With the improvement of living standards, the farmers of Xigou Village have developed clean and hygienic habits. In addition to regularly cleaning the streets and courtyards, they also pay attention to maternal and child health. This spring, four women received training in new-method delivery. The village also has a delivery kit, and is now jointly establishing a delivery station with neighboring villages. This year, seven babies were delivered using the new method, and both adults and children are healthy. Every woman under the age of forty-five in the village has two sanitary belts. In the past three years, adults and children have been vaccinated against smallpox and inoculated every year, and livestock have also implemented "looking after the trough insurance" (a livestock health care system established by livestock farmers and veterinary stations). Since the government called for the launch of a mass patriotic health campaign this year, the village houses and courtyards have generally been painted with lime once, and all toilets have wooden lids. The slogan raised by the masses is: "See a doctor when you are sick, pay attention to hygiene when you are not sick, and build a new Xigou with both people and wealth flourishing."
    Loving the Motherland and Actively Responding to the Government's Call
    Because the Party branch has strengthened its political leadership, often leads everyone to study current events and various policies and laws, and regularly conducts criticism and self-criticism within the mutual aid team and the agricultural, forestry, and animal husbandry production cooperative, the farmers' patriotic political enthusiasm is always full. They said: "The country is our people's country, and we should respond to all the country's calls with practical actions." In the winter of 1950, when the anti-US aggression and aid Korea movement had just begun, each mutual aid team and farm household generally formulated patriotic pacts. This year, the "Patriotic Day" system was promoted on the basis of the implementation of the patriotic pacts. The first day of each month is a "Patriotic Day." On this day, the village launches a mass inspection movement to carry out self-education. The "Patriotic Day" system has powerfully promoted the development of various tasks. Last year, the Anti-US Aggression and Aid Korea General Association called for the launch of the "patriotic donation movement." Li Shunda, on behalf of the masses of Xigou Village, first proposed to the farmers of the entire province to donate the "Patriotic Farmer" plane. The village donated 930,000 yuan. All eighteen militiamen are "ready to respond to the call of the motherland and defend national defense." The village's patriotic public grain is delivered well and quickly. Everyone is also extremely concerned about the families of the military. In 1951, the yield per mu of the seven military families in the village was five jin more than the average yield of the masses. This year, a contract production system was implemented, and the land of the military families was planted very well.
    The Party branch and the village government correctly implemented the Marriage Law. The phenomenon of arranged marriages by parents has been completely eliminated in Xigou Village. Women participate in production, learning, and various political activities the same as men, and the social and family status of women has been unprecedentedly improved. This year, the work days of the ninety-three women who participated in labor in the village accounted for about thirty percent of the total number of agricultural work days, and they received equal pay for equal work. Seventeen young women participated in the study of the rapid literacy method, and each person learned an average of more than 1,500 characters. Shen Jilan, a woman, was elected as a member of the county people's government. Therefore, many new-type families with united production, democracy, and harmony have emerged in Xigou Village.
    This summer, Xigou Village has formulated a three-year construction plan. The total income of agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry in the next three years will be increased to 134.9 percent on the basis of 1951. In the next three years, the relocation and merging of villages will be completed, and 62 houses will be built to solve the problem of scattered villages. On the basis of comprehensive cooperativization, various tasks in Xigou Village are continuing to advance in a planned manner.

    一个先进的新型农村—西沟村
    陈杰  满会  先付
    原来是地瘠民贫的小山庄
    山西平顺西沟村原是个地瘠民贫的小山庄。五十一户，二百三十七人，分住在九个自然庄内。四百七十三亩耕地，就分了两千多块。其中梯田占百分之六十以上。抗日战争以前，全村百分之六十的土地都操纵在占全村人口不到百分之六的地主富农手中。农民终年勤劳，不得温饱，过着“糠菜半年粮”的痛苦生活。一九四三年，日寇在这里进行残酷的烧杀抢掠，杀死十七个有劳动力的人，烧毁一半房子，三分之一的农具，还牵走七头牲口。生产遭到严重破坏，农民的生活更加痛苦。
    共产党的领导使西沟村人民永远摆脱了灾难和痛苦。西沟村的人民响应党的号召，积极对敌斗争，实行减租减息，土地改革，互助生产，终于把一个荒僻的穷山沟变成了先进的新农村。
    走上合作化的道路
    远在一九四三年，西沟村的农民就在中共支部书记、劳动模范李顺达的领导之下，遵照毛主席“组织起来”的指示，组织了互助组。十年来，全村的互助组一直是在发展着和巩固着。农村经济的发展，生产条件的改善，使农民们感到集体劳动、分散经营的互助组，已经不能满足进一步扩大再生产的需要，他们要求把劳动组织形式再提高一步。一九五一年冬，党支部以李顺达互助组为基础，领导二十一户农民，组成了一个农林畜牧生产合作社。现在全村五十一户，仅有三个无劳力户没有入社（他们也在准备入社）。村供销社也有了新的发展，全村十六岁以上的农民都参加了供销社。他们的生产、生活资料的供应和农产品的推销，几乎完全是由供销社负责的。今年秋天，供销社又增加了信用业务，吸收农民的零散资金投入生产。全村已走上生产、供销、信用三种合作社相互结合共同发展的全面合作化的道路。
    由于实行了互助合作，西沟村的生产逐年发展，该村农民的生产技术和投资力量不断提高。从一九四九年以来，在土地基本建设和改进技术方面，全村共垒起塌岸四百六十八丈；用里切外垫的办法，平整了六十五亩土地；把二十一亩坡地变成梯田；修河滩地十一亩。打蓄水池十个；扩大耕地面积三十八亩。一九五零年每亩平均施肥八十五担，去年平均一百担，今年一百二十五担。每年都是根据庄稼发育的需要进行三次施肥。今年耕地的百分之五十五使用新式步犁进行了深耕。耕作次数已由两次提高到三、四次。去年全部土地的百分之八十以上推广了良种，今年全部大秋作物种的都是优良品种。今年又推广了苏联的合理密植的先进经验，玉茭由每亩一千株增到一千五百株，谷子由每亩一万五千株增到二万株以上；并实行了三次定苗，保证了出苗齐全。在生产投资方面，据二十六户的调查，一九四九年的投资占总支出的百分之二十七，去年占百分之五十二，今年占百分之五十七。
    全村农民的集体主义思想逐渐增强，社会主义性质的公共财产逐年扩大了。现全村共有公共羊六百十四只、牲口二十五头、猪十七口，各种新旧农具等一百三十三件。这些公共财产约值一亿元，相当于全村一年农业的总收入。
    农林畜牧在发展
    互助合作使西沟村的农林畜牧事业日新月异地发展着。
    一九五零年各种农作物收入总值为八千一百二十万元。一九五一年收入总值为八千七百五十二万元。预计今年生产总值可达到一亿零二百三十万元，较战前提高了二点三倍，超过一九四九年百分之五十四点六。单位面积产量的提高更为明显，一九五零年每亩平均收获三百四十五斤，一九五一年为三百七十斤，今年为四百一十九斤。
    西沟村农民正确贯彻了山区发展生产的方针，三年来已合作造林五百三十亩，成活率达百分之七十左右。植树五千七百五十二株，其中干果树、水果树占半数以上。原有的六百五十亩林山都进行了修剪。还新辟了半亩育苗圃。如能有计划地划分林区，加强技术管理，重视接木工作，今后数年内可以绿化全沟，那时果木的生产将成为西沟村农民的主要收入。
    在畜牧业方面，一九四九年原有牲口四十九头，羊一百一十五只。三年以来一面繁殖，一面购买，牲畜已迅速增加，现有骡、马、驴、牛等牲口七十二头，羊六百一十四只、猪二十三口。以上总值九千二百三十二万元，比一九四九年增加百分之四十一点七。牲口当中百分之八十是母畜，并有牛、驴等种畜，只要加意喂养，畜牧事业即可大量地发展起来。
    农民的收入逐年增加
    随着生产的迅速发展，西沟村农民的收入逐年增加。在一九五一年，全村有余粮的农户已有三十九户，占总户数的百分之七十以上。因此，群众的生活有了显著改善。近三年内全村新建房屋四十五间，窑三孔。连一九四九年以前修建的在内，已把日寇烧毁的房子基本上恢复起来。三年以前，绝大多数农民依靠自己织土布穿衣，一九四九年全村仅有四户买了四十多尺市布。但从去年以来，情况大不同了。据村供销社从去年底到今年九月的统计，十个月中共供给社员一千六百二十五尺市布（每户平均三十一尺）。战前农民每人每年平均吃六斗粗粮，一九四九年每人平均吃两石一斗，一九五一年每人平均吃三石零七升，较抗战前提高了四倍。农民们描述他们生活的变化时说：战前是“糠汤菜水家常饭，吃顿小米顶过年。”三年前是“黄圪?，小米饭，吃顿白面是希罕。”现在是“米面生活变花样，油盐调料加醋酱”。又说：“从前有米不嫌淡，现在吃饭讲香甜。”现在家家都点煤油灯，省下麻油改善伙食。但西沟村的农民并不以此为满足，他们说：“好日子才开了头，更好的日子在后头。我们要在共产党、毛主席的领导下，为走向社会主义社会而奋斗。”
    没有文化的时代就要过去了
    过去，西沟村根本没有小学。全村仅四个人粗通文字。农民处处感到不识字的困难。一九四八年开始建立小学，大家把这看做一件大喜事，一开学就送子女入了学。三年来初小毕业的有十二人，其中继续升学的十人，已有一人升入初中，九人入了高小。
    一九五零年，全村成立了两所常年民校，分为文化班、普通班两班。识字多的人入文化班，文盲入普通班。全村的成年人已全部入学。文化班的二十九人都有一套完整的文具和一部分书籍，有一部分人还买了自来水钢笔。今年七月，全村开展了速成识字运动。全村四十一个不识字或识字不多的成年人，经过二十七天的学习，已有十人认识了二千五百字，八人认识了二千字，十九人认识了一千五百字左右，四人认识了一千字左右。在七月二十五日庆祝速成识字班学员毕业的大会上，他们又订出了巩固和提高学习成绩的计划。准备在今年年底消灭全部文盲。现在每个学员都是书不离身，有空就学习。西沟村没有文化的时代快要过去了。
    一九五零年村内建立了一所小型图书馆。馆内有科学技术、妇婴卫生的书籍、图画、苏联画库、抗美援朝小丛书等共三百七十五种。自开展速成识字运动后，借阅书报的人更多，读报组也更加活跃了。现全村订有三份山西日报，二份山西画报，六份山西农民报，山西青年报、人民日报、少年儿童报各一份。他们规定了定期读报的制度，生产小组也是读报小组。今年八月村内更安装了一架收音机，经常收听时事、政治新闻和生产上的先进经验的广播。这又给全村农民的政治文化生活增加了新的内容。
    随着生活的提高，西沟村的农民已养成了清洁卫生的习惯。他们除了经常注意打扫街院外，也注意了妇婴卫生。今年春季有四个妇女受过新法接产的训练。村内并设有接产箱，现在正和邻村联合成立接产站。今年用新法接产了七个婴儿，大人小孩都健康。该村四十五岁以下的妇女，每人都有了两条卫生带。三年来大人小孩每年都种牛痘、打防疫针，牲口也都实行“看槽保险”（是养畜户和兽医站订立的一种牲畜保健制度）。自今年政府号召开展群众性的爱国卫生运动以来，全村屋院一般都用石灰涂刷了一次，所有厕所都有木板盖。群众提的口号是：“有病请医生，无病讲卫生，建立人财两旺的新西沟”。
    热爱祖国积极响应政府的号召
    由于党支部加强了政治领导，经常领导大家学习时事及各项政策法令，并在互助组和农林牧生产合作社内部经常进行批评和自我批评，因此，农民爱国主义的政治热情经常是饱满的。他们说：“国家是咱们人民的国家，咱们应该用实际行动来响应国家的一切号召。”一九五零年冬季抗美援朝运动刚开始，各互助组和农户就普遍订立了爱国公约。今年又在执行爱国公约的基础上推行了“爱国日”制度。每月初一过“爱国日”。在这一天，村内开展群众性的检查运动借此来进行自我教育。“爱国日”制度有力地推动了各项工作的开展。去年抗美援朝总会号召开展“爱国捐献运动”，李顺达代表西沟村群众，首先向全省农民提出捐献“爱国农民号”飞机的建议。全村捐了九十三万元。十八个民兵都是“随时响应祖国召唤，保卫国防。”全村的爱国公粮交的又好又快。大家对军属也极其关心。一九五一年全村七户军属的产量每亩比群众的平均产量多五斤。今年更实行了包产制，军属的地都种得很好。
    党支部和村政府正确贯彻了婚姻法。西沟村已完全消灭了家长包办婚姻的现象。妇女和男人一样的参加了生产、学习和各种政治活动，妇女的社会地位和家庭地位空前提高。今年全村九十三个妇女参加劳动的工数占农业总工数的百分之三十左右，并取得了同工同酬的待遇。十七个青年妇女参加了速成识字法的学习，每人平均认识了一千五百多字。妇女申记兰被选为县人民政府委员。因此，西沟村出现了许多团结生产、民主和睦的新型家庭。
    今年夏天，西沟村已订出三年建设计划。三年内农林畜牧业的总收入将要在一九五一年的基础上，提高到百分之一百三十四点九。三年内要完成移住并庄，盖房六十二间，解决村庄分散的问题。西沟村的各项工作在全面合作化的基础上，正有计划地继续前进。
