    The Workers' Families of the Wangjiayuan Mine Organized Mutual Aid Groups
    Editor: The workers' families of the Wangjiayuan Mine in the Pingxiang Coal Mine, Jiangxi, live very scattered and have little contact with each other. In the past, when a wife gave birth, the husband had to take five or six days off work to take care of her. If labor started at night, there was no one to find a doctor. To solve this problem, under the leadership of Xiao Xuanlan, the workers' families organized six mutual aid groups according to the distance of their residences. On the evening of August 8, when worker Zhang Chengshui's wife gave birth, Zhang Chengshui went to work, and Cheng Chungui, a member of the mutual aid group, climbed over several mountains to find a doctor. On October 20, Hu Meijun and Hu Bijun, members of the mutual aid group, saw that Zheng Dongsheng's wife was about to give birth, and they immediately went to find a doctor and also cooked Zheng Dongsheng's meals. In addition, each mutual aid group also mobilized pregnant women to attend meetings to listen to doctors explain new delivery methods and methods for protecting babies. These activities of the mutual aid groups have solved some of the difficulties of the families, enabling the miners to work more at ease.    Wang Chongding

    王家沅矿场的职工家属组织了互助组
    编辑同志：江西萍乡煤矿王家沅矿场的职工家属，住得很分散，互相联系很少。过去，妻子生小孩，丈夫就要请五、六天假在家照顾，遇到夜间临产，就没人给找医生。为解决这问题，职工家属在萧萱兰领导下，按住地远近，组织了六个互助组。八月八日晚，工人张成水的妻子生小孩，张成水上班去了，互助组组员程春贵，爬过几个山给找来医生。十月二十日互助组员胡美君、胡碧君，见郑冬生妻子要生小孩，也马上去找医生，并把郑冬生吃的饭也做好了。另外，各互助组还发动孕妇参加会议，听取医生讲解新接生法和保护婴儿的方法等。互助组的这些活动，解决了家属的某些困难，使矿工更能安心生产。    王崇鼎
