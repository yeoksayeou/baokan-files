    Tangshan Municipal People's Government Values Public Opinion
    City Traffic Safety Problems Basically Solved
    Editor: After the "Reader's Letters" page on May 21st raised the issue of traffic safety in Tangshan, the Construction Bureau of the Tangshan Municipal People's Government and other relevant departments paid great attention to this issue and took some necessary measures to avoid traffic accidents. Protective wire mesh has been erected in dangerous areas where railways pass through factories and mines; traffic police have been added at key traffic intersections. The Construction Bureau recently made fourteen warning umbrellas and installed safety lights and bells, which are placed at important traffic posts.
    What is particularly exciting is that Tangshan is undergoing a large-scale municipal construction project, and the problem of traffic safety in the city will be basically solved. According to incomplete statistics from the Construction Bureau, the total length of roads that have been repaired and are being repaired this year is approximately 17,477 meters, with an area of approximately 179,471 square meters. The Qiaotun underpass is a vital north-south traffic artery in Tangshan, and vehicles from the surrounding countryside and workers from various factories must pass through here. However, the original underpass was only two meters high and three and a half meters wide, making it impossible for even large vehicles carrying goods to pass through, let alone cars. From mid-July, the Construction Bureau and the Tianjin Railway Administration have jointly constructed this underpass. After the renovation, the underpass will have two lanes, each six meters wide and five point eight meters high, allowing large trucks to pass through smoothly in both directions. The four roads leading to the underpass (totaling 1,447 meters in length) are also being renovated and converted into eight- to thirteen-meter-wide cement roads with sidewalks on both sides. It is said that this project will be completed in mid-November. In addition, some buildings that seriously hindered traffic have been demolished after the Municipal People's Government fully persuaded and mobilized the homeowners and residents, thus resolving the local traffic safety problem.
    The 500,000 people of Tangshan unanimously and enthusiastically support and sincerely thank the People's Government for these measures. Everyone has further recognized that the People's Government truly values ​​public opinion and does good things for the people, and has further realized the superiority of our national system. Chang Jing'an, an old worker at the Qixin Cement Plant, said to me: "The People's Government is really doing good things for us! In the past, road repairs were intended for officials to use; now it's not like that, we want to use that road, and the People's Government is repairing that road."
    The above measures are only the beginning of Tangshan's municipal construction. Tangshan, like our great motherland, will become more prosperous day by day. The Tangshan Urban Planning Committee is planning to expand the urban area, relocate the commercial district, and build Tangshan into a modern city. At that time, the city streets will be tidy, the traffic order will be in good order, and the face of Tangshan will be greatly changed. All of us in the city are determined to work hard to achieve this day as soon as possible. Feng Chun

    唐山市人民政府重视群众意见
    市内交通安全问题已基本解决
    编辑同志：五月二十一日“读者来信专页”提出了唐山市的交通安全问题以后，唐山市人民政府建设局和其他有关部门非常注意这个问题，并采取了一些必要的措施，以避免交通事故的发生。各厂矿铁道通行的危险地段，都设立了铁丝防护网；各交通要道都添加了交通岗哨。建设局最近制做了十四个警伞，并安装安全灯和警铃，设在各重要交通岗位上。
    人们特别兴奋的是，唐山市正在进行着大规模的市政建设工程，市内交通安全问题将获得基本解决。据建设局不完全统计：今年已经修好和正在修理的马路，全长约一万七千四百七十七公尺，面积约十七万九千四百七十一平方公尺。乔屯地道桥是唐山市贯通南北的交通要道，从四乡来的车辆和各工厂的工人们都要从这里通过。可是原来的地道桥通道只有两公尺高、三公尺半宽，不用说汽车，就连装载货物多的大车都不能通过。从七月中旬起，建设局和天津铁路管理局已经联合修建这座地道桥。修好以后，地道桥将有两个通道，每个宽六公尺、高五点八公尺，双行的大卡车也可以畅通。通往地道桥的四个马路（全长一千四百四十七公尺），也正在翻修，改成宽八公尺到十三公尺的水泥路，两旁并有行人道。这个工程，听说在十一月中旬可以全部完工。此外，一些严重妨碍交通的建筑物，经市人民政府向房主和住户作了充分的说服动员工作后，也被拆除了，使当地交通安全问题得到了解决。
    唐山市五十万人民一致热烈拥护和衷心感激人民政府这些措施。大家进一步认识到人民政府是真正重视群众意见和给人民办好事的，也进一步体会到了我们国家制度的优越性。启新洋灰厂老工人常敬安对我说：“人民政府真给我们办好事啦！在过去，修马路是预备给当官人走的；现在不那样了，我们要走那条路，人民政府给修那条路。”
    以上这些措施还只是唐山市市政建设的开端。唐山市和我们伟大的祖国一样，将一天天走向繁荣。唐山市都市建设计划委员会正计划扩大市区，迁移繁华区，把唐山市建设成一个现代化的城市。那时，市区街道整齐，交通秩序井然，唐山市的面貌将大大改变。我们全市人民都决心为争取这一天早日到来而努力。枫椿
