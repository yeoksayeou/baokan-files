Tikhonov, head of the Soviet cultural workers delegation, spoke. He said: "'Sino-Soviet Friendship Month' begins on the eve of the glorious festival of the laborers of the world, the 35th anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution. This is the special significance of our friendly festival. On this day, the people of China and the Soviet Union greet each other with brotherly goodwill.

The peace-loving people of all countries look at the love and friendship between our two peoples with trust and admiration, and congratulate our two peoples on their peaceful alliance." Tikhonov's speech was met with continuous stormy applause.
    Premier Zhou Enlai spoke. Premier Zhou first congratulated the festival of the working people of the world - the 35th anniversary of the Great Soviet October Socialist Revolution. He said: "On behalf of the Chinese people, the Chinese government, and the Chinese Communist Party, let me extend warm congratulations to the great Soviet people, to the great teacher of progressive mankind around the world and the most beloved friend of the Chinese people, Comrade Stalin."

Then, Premier Zhou Enlai summarized the great significance of the Soviet October Socialist Revolution, the enormous role of the Sino-Soviet friendly alliance in maintaining world peace, and the selfless assistance given by the Soviet Union to China in various aspects over the past three years, and emphasized: "There is no doubt that continuing to strengthen the friendly cooperation between the people of China and the Soviet Union, and better learning the revolutionary theories of Lenin and Stalin and the advanced experience of Soviet socialist construction, is of extremely great significance for the victory of our country's upcoming large-scale economic construction. It is equally unquestionable that the Soviet Union's infinitely warm assistance to our country cannot but arouse the Chinese people's increasingly deep and strong 'trust, sympathy, and support' for the Soviet people, as Comrade Stalin hoped." When Premier Zhou Enlai spoke, enthusiastic applause rang out continuously throughout the hall.
    Gudev, Chargé d'Affaires ad interim of the Soviet Embassy, spoke. He said: The October Socialist Revolution opened a new era in the history of human development. The great October Socialist Revolution established brotherly relations between the people of the Soviet Union and China. The enemies of the Soviet and Chinese peoples have tried every means to hinder the establishment of friendly relations between our two great peoples, because they fear this friendship. The victory of the Chinese people and the establishment of the People's Republic of China paved the way for the development of brotherly friendship between the Soviet Union and China. He pointed out: "The recent successful talks between the Soviet government and the delegation of the government of the People's Republic of China once again demonstrated the development of Soviet-Chinese friendship and the consolidation of the Soviet-Chinese alliance." When Gudev spoke, the entire hall applauded warmly.
    Qian Junrui, Secretary-General of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, read the congratulatory telegram to Marshal Stalin. After reading, all attendees stood up in unison and applauded enthusiastically for a long time.
    The conference concluded with the band playing "The Hearts of the People of the World are One." (Attached picture)
