Comrade Jinming:
    You know how happy I am writing this letter to you! Since receiving the good news of your meritorious service, comrades at the Fengtai Vehicle Depot and neighbors have been congratulating me. Jinming, please accept their congratulations, which I am passing on, and my own congratulations to you.

    The Fengtai Vehicle Depot has already held a celebration and commendation meeting for you. Mom and I sat at the very front of the venue. The table was covered with a blanket, decorated with flowers, and tea was served. On the stage was a framed certificate of your meritorious service, attracting countless eyes. Comrade Liu Qi, the chairman of the trade union, reported on your heroic deeds. Female worker committee member Yan Yuling read out the words on the certificate of merit, word by word. Each sentence was followed by applause. Amidst the applause, Mom and I went up to the stage, and Comrade Liu Qi personally pinned honorary flowers on us. Our child also had a big red flower pinned on his chest, making his little face glow red. My face felt a little red too. I didn't say it, but I was thinking of what you said when you left: "I am going to resist America and aid Korea, and I will definitely strive to earn merit. You wait for good news!" I finally waited for good news.

    That day, after the trade union took a photo of our whole family, everyone surrounded us and escorted us all the way to our home—the new workers' dormitory.

    Oh, I forgot, I haven't told you about the new dormitory yet! A few days ago, Comrade Liu Lianggui came to our house and said: "Sister-in-law Li, the railway has built new houses, and the trade union wants me to ask for your opinion on whether you would like to move in. The first new houses built are reserved for families of honored military personnel." I discussed it with Mom, and she was so happy she could barely speak. On the day of the move, many people from the depot came. They had all come to help without resting after working the night shift. I didn't recognize most of them, and I felt a little embarrassed. But when I was being polite, they said: Brother Li is resisting America and aiding Korea for everyone, this little thing is nothing. They also said: If there is anything in the future, just send a message, and we will come. Really, the comrades treat our family too well.

    The house number of our new home is 98, north-facing, with snow-white walls, cement floor, white ceiling, glass windows, and glass doors. There is plenty of light, and it's really beautiful. Our family occupies one and a half rooms, which is quite spacious. When we first moved in, Mom held Guangrong (光荣, meaning "glory") and looked here and there, making her very happy.

    In your last letter, you said that my letters were not clear enough and that I should study hard. I am preparing to join a literacy class, and Mom agrees. She said, "Go ahead and don't worry, leave the children to me!" Our children are very healthy. Yingchun (迎春, meaning "welcoming spring") runs around playing everywhere; Guangrong is also very lively. Mom is very healthy. These days, she is busy catching mice everywhere. She says: "Exterminate the flies and mice, and defeat the American imperialists' germ warfare!"

    Wife, Liu Xiuyin

### 军属刘秀银写给志愿军功臣李金明的一封信

    军属刘秀银写给志愿军功臣李金明的一封信金明同志：
    你知道我在给你写这封信时，心里是多么高兴啊！自从接到了你的立功喜报以后，丰台车辆段的同志们和街坊、邻居，见了我就道贺。金明，请你接受我转达的他们的祝贺，和我自己对你的祝贺吧。
    丰台车辆段已经给你开了庆功贺喜大会。我和妈坐在会场的最前面。桌上铺着毯子，放着鲜花，沏着茶。主席台上放着一个镜框，框内夹着你立功的奖状，无数双眼睛被它吸引着。工会主席刘启同志向大家报告了你的英勇事迹。女工委员阎玉苓，一个字一个字地念着立功奖状上的词句。念一句，大家鼓一次掌。在掌声中，我和妈走上了主席台，刘启同志亲自给我们带上了光荣花。咱孩子的胸脯上也挂了一朵大红花，把小脸都映红了。我的脸也觉着有点发红。嘴里没说，心里在想着你临走时的话：“我去抗美援朝，一定争取立功，你等着听好消息吧！”我终于等到好消息了。
    那天，工会给咱全家照了一张相之后，大伙簇拥着，一直把我们送到了咱家——新的工人宿舍。
    咳，我倒忘了，还没把新宿舍的事告诉你呀！前些日子，刘良桂同志到咱家说：“李大嫂，铁路上盖了新房子，工会要我征求你的意见，看你愿不愿搬去。第一次盖的新房子，先尽光荣军属住。”我跟咱妈一商量，她高兴得几乎说不出话来。搬家那天，段上来了很多人，他们都是下夜班没休息就来帮忙的。多数同志我都不认识，真觉得有点不好意思。可是我一客气，他们就说：李大哥抗美援朝为大家，这点小事算啥。还说：以后有事，只要捎个信，我们就来。真的，同志们待咱家太好了。
    咱们新房子的门牌是九十八号，北房，雪白的墙，洋灰地，白顶棚，玻璃窗户，玻璃门，光线充足，可真漂亮。咱家住一间半，挺宽阔的。刚搬进来时，咱妈抱着光荣儿，瞧瞧这儿，看看那儿，可把她老人家乐坏了。
    上次你来信说，我写的信不够清楚，要我好好学习。我正准备参加识字班，妈也同意。她说：“放心去吧，把孩子交给我！”咱的孩子都很健壮。迎春会到处跑着玩了；光荣也很活泼。咱妈挺健康。这两天，他忙着到处捕耗子，她说：“把苍蝇、耗子打尽，打败美国鬼子的细菌战！”
    妻  刘秀银
