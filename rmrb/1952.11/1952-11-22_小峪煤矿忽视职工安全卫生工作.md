    Xiaoyu Coal Mine Neglects Employee Safety and Health Work
    To the Editor: The leading cadres of the Xiaoyu Coal Mine in Datong, Shanxi Province, neglect the safety and health of their employees, resulting in continuous casualties and many employees suffering from sores and illnesses.
    The mine's underground ventilation is poor, and the temperature is too high. Workers in the workface cannot bear the heat and cannot get hot water to drink. At the same time, there are no toilet facilities underground, so workers have to defecate and urinate everywhere, filling the place with a foul odor. The workers' dormitories and canteens are even dirtier. Not only are there many insects on the ceiling, but insects and insect droppings are often found in the pots, food, bowls, and water. As a result, many workers suffer from sores and illnesses. According to statistics from September of this year, out of more than five hundred employees, one hundred and twenty-five had sores and thirty-nine were ill. In addition, six workers have been killed by rockfalls since July of last year. However, these serious problems have not attracted the attention of the mine's leading cadres. Therefore, I suggest that the higher-level leading organs of the mine should quickly go deep into the field, investigate, and deal with the matter properly.

    小峪煤矿忽视职工安全卫生工作
    编辑同志：山西大同小峪煤矿领导干部忽视职工安全卫生工作，以致不断发生伤亡事故，还有很多职工生疮害病。
    该矿矿下通风不良，温度太高，工人在工作面工作时，热得受不了，又喝不到开水。同时，坑下没有厕所设备，工人们不得不到处大、小便，弄得到处充满臭味。工人的宿舍、食堂更脏，不但房顶上有很多虫子，而且锅、饭、碗、水里，也常发现虫子和虫子粪。因而，工人生疮害病的很多。据今年九月份统计，五百多名职工中，有一百二十五名生疮，三十九名害病。另外，从去年七月到现在，砸死工人六名。但这些严重问题，并未引起该矿领导干部的注意。因此，我建议该矿的上级领导机关，应迅速深入现场，加以调查，并作妥善处理。
