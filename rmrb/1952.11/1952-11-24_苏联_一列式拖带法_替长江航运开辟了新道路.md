    The Soviet "single-row towing method," an advanced experience in inland river shipping, has greatly improved the efficiency of barge transportation on the Yangtze River, China's major water transportation artery, since its implementation. The beautiful and magnificent Yangtze River will contribute even more to the country's transportation industry.

    The "single-row towing method" is an advanced barge transportation method in the Soviet inland river shipping industry. This method involves arranging several barges into a long row of different formations, utilizing tugboats for towing, based on factors such as the direction of travel (upstream or downstream), water flow speed, waterway conditions, and vessel performance. Its advantages are reducing water resistance, fully leveraging the tugboat's traction efficiency, achieving "more towing, faster speed, lower cost, and higher efficiency," while also ensuring safe navigation. In the past, barge transportation on the Yangtze River mostly employed the British and American "parallel method," attaching barges to both sides of the tugboat or arranging them side by side behind the tugboat. Using this method, vessels experienced significant water resistance, resulting in low speed and small towing capacity. Each tugboat could only tow two barges, with each horsepower capable of towing only two to three tons of cargo. Now, with the application of the "single-row towing method," each tugboat can tow up to six barges, increasing the towing capacity per horsepower to ten to twelve tons.

    Barge transportation is the most common and economical mode of transportation in inland river shipping, and the widespread adoption of the "single-row towing method" on the Yangtze River has significant implications for the development of inland river shipping. Since October of last year, sailors and technicians from the Yangtze River Navigation Administration, under the guidance of Soviet inland river shipping expert Romanov and water conservancy expert Bukov, have launched a surge in learning the "single-row towing method" and achieved great success. Over the past year, more than 70% of the tugboats under the Yangtze River Navigation Administration have implemented the "single-row towing method," resulting in a general increase in transportation efficiency of more than double. Now, if you chat with any sailor or deckhand from the Yangtze River Navigation Administration, they will enthusiastically tell you about the benefits of the "single-row towing method." I once had a discussion with the crew of a small "Guoyun" vessel; they said that before the implementation of the single-row towing method, for more than ten years, this 320-horsepower tugboat had never exceeded a towing capacity of 600 tons from Shihuiyao to Hankou. However, after implementing the single-row towing method, they first towed 960 tons, then 1,050 tons, and the fifth time even reached 1,431 tons, while the travel time was reduced from 41 hours to 31 hours. The crew members excitedly said:

    "Each time we load more and travel faster. Now I really can't say how much this ship can tow or how fast it can go. The Soviet elder brother's method is really excellent!"

    When the "single-row towing method" began to be promoted on the Yangtze River, it encountered resistance from various conservative ideas. Some veteran sailors said:

    "I've worked on the river for more than ten years and have never seen this 'dragon-like' towing method. This method is very dangerous!" Some technicians said:

    "The single-row towing method can only be used for towing in the narrow Tianjin inner harbor. The Yangtze River has a wide surface area and fast currents, so this towing method cannot be used." Some even brought out the outdated British and American "navigation regulations" and said, "The 'single-row towing method' does not comply with navigation regulations and cannot be implemented!" In response to these conservative ideas, the Yangtze River Navigation Administration, on the one hand, conducted propaganda and education for sailors and technicians, and on the other hand, conducted on-site experiments to prove the superiority of Soviet advanced experience with facts. On October 10th of last year, the leaders of the Shanghai Branch of the Yangtze River Navigation Administration decided to have the "Guoqing" vessel conduct the first trial of the single-row towing method on the Yangtze River, while also sending the "Guoshan" vessel to sail upstream from Nanjing to Yuxikou using the British and American "parallel method." The results of the trial voyage showed that the "Guoqing" vessel arrived at its destination safely three hours earlier than using the "parallel method," saving one and a half tons of fuel and thirty-six taels of boiler water oil. Although the "Guoshan" vessel increased its speed compared to normal, it still arrived at its destination one hour after the "Guoqing" vessel. The successful trial voyage of the "Guoqing" vessel powerfully struck down conservative ideas and educated the sailors and technicians of the Yangtze River Navigation Administration. Subsequently, the Guodu, Guokang, Guohai, and other vessels in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River universally learned and adopted this advanced towing method. In April of this year, the tugboats participating in the Jingjiang flood diversion project in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, under the guidance of Soviet water conservancy expert Bukov, also began to implement the single-row towing method. At that time, in order to complete the urgent transportation task of the Jingjiang flood diversion, Bukov imparted the experience of the single-row towing method to the sailors, and transportation efficiency immediately increased by 150%. Inland river shipping expert Romanov also personally conducted experiments on the shipping lanes near Hankou. Thanks to the sincere help of Soviet experts, the "single-row towing method" was finally promoted throughout the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River. In the tributaries of the Yangtze River, such as the winding, narrow, and shoal-filled Xiangjiang River, the single-row towing method was also applied. Now, on the beautiful banks of the Yangtze River, you will often see a tugboat towing a long line of barges, just like a locomotive pulling a long line of carriages, traveling back and forth on the great river.

    苏联“一列式拖带法”替长江航运开辟了新道路
    新华社记者  林耀
    苏联内河航运先进经验“一列式拖带法”，在我国水上运输大动脉——长江中推行以后，长江上的拖驳运输效率大大提高。美丽雄伟的长江，将为祖国的运输事业贡献出更大的力量。
    “一列式拖带法”是苏联内河航运事业中，先进的拖驳运输方法。这个方法是根据航行方向（上水或下水）、水流速度、航道和船只性能等情况，把几只驳船编成一长列各种不同的队形，利用拖轮拖带。它的优点是可以减少江水阻力，充分发挥拖轮的牵引效率，做到“拖得多、行得快、成本低、效率高”，航行也很安全。过去，长江上的拖驳运输大多采用英美的“并列法”，将驳船绑附拖轮的两侧，或将驳船并排尾随拖轮。采用这种办法，船只遭受江水阻力很大，速度低，拖运量小。每只拖轮只能拖两只驳船，每匹马力只能拖两吨到三吨货物。现在运用“一列式拖带法”，每只拖轮最多可以拖六只驳船，每匹马力的拖带量提高到十吨到十二吨。
    拖驳运输是内河航运中最普遍、最经济的运输方式，“一列式拖带法”在长江航运上普遍采用，对发展内河航运有极大意义。从去年十月起，长江航务管理局的海员和技术人员就在苏联内河航运专家罗曼诺夫和水利专家布可夫的指导下，掀起了学习“一列式拖带法”的热潮，取得了很大成绩。一年多来，长江航务管理局已有百分之七十以上的拖轮实行了“一列式拖带法”，运输效率普遍提高一倍以上。现在，你随便和长江航务管理局的那一位海员、水手们闲谈，他都会滔滔不绝地把“一列式拖带法”的好处告诉你。我曾经和一只不大的“国运”号轮船的船员们在一起座谈；他们说在没有实行一列式拖带法以前，十多年来，这只三百二十匹马力的拖轮，从石灰窑到汉口的拖载量最多没有超过六百吨，可是实行一列式拖带法以后，他们第一次拖了九百六十吨、第二次拖了一千零五十吨、第五次竟拖到一千四百三十一吨，而航行时间却由四十一小时缩短到三十一小时。船员们兴奋地说：
    “一次比一次装得多、跑得快，现在我真说不出这只船到底能拖多少？能跑多快？苏联老大哥的办法真是好极了！”
    在“一列式拖带法”开始在长江推广的时候，遇到了各式各样保守思想的抵抗。有的老海员说：
    “我在河下干了十多年，从没有看见过这种‘一条龙’的拖船法，这办法很危险！”有的技术人员说：
    “一列式拖带法只能在狭小的天津内港拖运，长江江面宽，水流急，不能用这种拖带法。”有的竟把英美式的腐旧的“航行规章”捧出来说：“‘一列式拖带法’不合航行规章，不能行！”针对以上各种保守思想，长江航务管理局一方面对海员和技术人员进行宣传教育，一方面进行实地试验，用事实来证明苏联先进经验的优越性。去年十月十日，长江航务局上海分局领导方面决定以“国青”轮在长江首次试行一列式拖带法，同时又派“国山”轮仍用英美式的“并列法”同时自南京上驶至裕溪口。试航结果，“国青”轮较过去用“并列法”提早三个小时平安地到达了目的地，节省了一吨半燃料和三十六两调水油。“国山”轮虽然比平时速度增加，但仍在国青轮到达一小时后，才到达目的地。“国青”轮试航成功，有力地打击了保守思想，并教育了长江航务管理局的海员和技术人员。接着长江下游的国都轮、国康轮、国海轮等等都普遍学习与采用了这一先进的拖带法。今年四月，长江中游参加荆江分洪工程的拖轮，在苏联水利专家布可夫指导下，也开始实行了一列式拖带法。当时为了完成荆江分洪的紧迫运输任务，布可夫把一列式拖带法的经验传授给海员，运输效率立即提高了百分之一百五十。内河航运专家罗曼诺夫并在汉口附近的航线上亲自试验。由于苏联专家真诚的帮助，“一列式拖带法”终于在长江的中、下游全部推广。在长江的支流，如弯曲、狭窄、多滩的湘江，也运用了一列式拖带法。现在，在优美的扬子江畔，会不时地看到一只拖轮拖着一长列的驳船就像机车牵引着一长列的车厢一样在大江中往返行驰。
