    Lenin and Stalin were the leaders and organizers of the Great October Socialist Revolution
    Master of Soviet History  Bakhshiev
    The Soviet people and the working people of all countries are warmly celebrating the thirty-fifth anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution. The Great October Socialist Revolution opened a new era in human history—an era of the collapse of capitalism and the victory of communism. For thirty-five years, the victorious socialist state of the Soviet Union has illuminated the path to freedom and happiness for the people of the world like an eternal torch. Now, the Soviet Union leads a powerful international camp defending peace and democracy. For the first time in history, a powerful and united camp of peace-loving forces has emerged. In capitalist countries, the organization of the working class has grown, and powerful international democratic organizations of workers, peasants, women, and youth have been established. Communist parties, which are carrying out a heroic struggle to safeguard the cause of peace, have grown and been consolidated. The tide of hatred and resistance of all peoples against American imperialism is rising higher and higher. American imperialism is now not only an aggressor but also a world gendarme striving to stifle freedom and cultivate fascism everywhere.
    The international significance of the October Socialist Revolution, the power of its influence on the entire course of world history, the greatness of its inspirers and organizers, Lenin and Stalin, and the power of the heroic Communist Party they created, are expanding profoundly year by year.
    Under the leadership of Lenin and Stalin, the Communist Party won over the broad masses of working people to the invincible banner of Marx-Engels-Lenin-Stalin and educated them in the spirit of revolution. Lenin and Stalin tempered the Party in an irreconcilable struggle against opportunists and all enemies of the working people. Lenin and Stalin armed the Party with advanced theories and ideologies, scientific programs and organizational principles, and brilliant strategies and tactics—the science of leading the proletariat in class struggle. Based on an analysis of the balance of class forces in the era of imperialism, Lenin and Stalin proved that the proletariat could and should be the leader of the bourgeois democratic revolution achieved in alliance with the peasantry. Lenin and Stalin pointed out the brilliant prospect of the transformation of the bourgeois democratic revolution into a socialist revolution, thereby enriching Marxism with the latest revolutionary theory. Based on the most profound analysis of the dying stage of capitalism—imperialism, Lenin and Stalin created the brilliant theory of the possibility of the victory of socialism in one country, created the Soviet regime as the best state form of the dictatorship of the proletariat, and determined the special form of the class alliance of the proletariat and the peasantry with the proletariat playing a leading role as the dictatorship of the proletariat. Lenin and Stalin formulated a complete doctrine on the national question, on the national revolution in the era of imperialism; they linked the national question in the colonies with the question of overthrowing capitalism.
    Lenin-Stalin's theory of socialist revolution pointed out a bright prospect for the struggling proletariat and inspired their initiative in attacking the imperialist bourgeoisie in their own countries.
    The Lenin-Stalin Party firmly led the Russian working class and peasants in attacking the Tsarist system and capitalism. In February 1917, the bourgeois democratic revolution triumphed in Russia, the Tsarist system was overthrown, and Soviets of Workers', Soldiers', and Peasants' Deputies were established throughout the country. Simultaneously with the emergence of the Soviets, a bourgeois provisional government was also established. Under the leadership of Lenin and Stalin, the Bolshevik Party launched preparations for the broad masses of working people to overthrow the bourgeoisie, which had seized power with the help of the Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries. The tasks mentioned in Lenin's "April Theses," Lenin's speeches, and Stalin's writings became the program of action for the Party and the working class.
    After July, when the bourgeois provisional government, relying on the support of the Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries, shot and killed workers and soldiers in Petrograd who demanded the transfer of power to the Soviets and the cessation of the imperialist war, the domestic political situation became sharply intensified. At that time, Russia's economic crisis grew. The capitalists attempted to strangle the Russian revolution with the lean hands of hunger. The First World War, which had already sacrificed millions of people, continued. In 1917, the new beast of imperialism, the United States, which was trying to dominate the world, joined the war against Germany. American billionaires did everything possible to support the counter-revolutionary provisional government in Russia and supplied it with billions of dollars to suppress the Russian revolution and enslave Russia. In those years, the counter-revolutionary provisional government of the Russian bourgeoisie carried out brutal persecution of the Bolshevik Party, which fought heroically for the interests of the working people. Lenin had to go into hiding. Stalin saved the precious life of the great leader of the working people, protecting him from the persecution of the counter-revolutionary provisional government's secret agents and executioners. Stalin maintained contact with Lenin and directly led all the Party's activities. Under these difficult conditions, the Party's Sixth Congress was held secretly from July 26 to August 3. The Congress united around Stalin, who upheld Lenin's doctrine that socialism could be victorious in one country. Stalin resolutely pointed out all attempts by the Trotskyites and Bukharinites—who were then hidden enemies of Leninism—to stop the Russian revolution at the bourgeois democratic stage. Those who lacked confidence and capitulators, who fawned on the capitalist West and the opportunism of the Second International, proposed the possibility that the Russian socialist revolution would be dependent on the proletarian revolution in the West. Stalin, in exposing the opportunists and capitulators, said: "It is very possible that it is Russia that will become the country that opens the road to socialism...It is necessary to abandon the antiquated notion that only Europe can show us the way" (Russian edition of "Biography of Stalin," pages 63-64).
    Under Stalin's leadership, following Lenin's instructions, the Sixth Congress directed the Communist Party towards armed uprising and towards the realization of the dictatorship of the proletariat in Russia.
    Lenin and Stalin bravely and confidently, firmly and cautiously, led the Party and the working class towards the socialist revolution.
    On October 7, Lenin secretly arrived in Petrograd. He fully agreed with the plan for an armed uprising formulated by Stalin. On October 10, a meeting of the Central Committee was held, at which Lenin gave a report and put forward the historic resolution on armed uprising. The Central Committee rejected the surrender proposals of the traitors Zinoviev, Kamenev, and Trotsky, who opposed the armed uprising, adopted Lenin's resolution, and began to promote its realization. On October 16, the Central Committee elected the Party Central Committee, headed by Stalin, to lead the uprising.
    No matter how much it mobilized all counter-revolutionary forces, no matter how much the American, British, and French imperialists helped the provisional government, no matter how much the betrayal of Zinoviev, Kamenev, and Trotsky sold out the Bolshevik Party's plan to the bourgeoisie—nothing could stop the forward development of the socialist revolution. On October 24, the Bolshevik newspaper "Worker's Path" published Comrade Stalin's article calling on the masses to overthrow the provisional government. From the night of October 25 to 26, workers—Red Guards, revolutionary soldiers, and sailors, following the call of Lenin and Stalin, attacked the Winter Palace and arrested Kerensky's counter-revolutionary government.
    The cruiser "Aurora," with its cannon fire, announced that October 25, 1917, was the beginning of the Great Socialist Revolution. On the night of October 25 (November 7, Gregorian calendar), while the invincible armed uprising of the working people was in full swing, the Second Congress of Soviets declared that all power in the country was transferred to the Soviets of Workers', Peasants', and Soldiers' Deputies. The Congress passed decrees on ceasefire and the establishment of a democratic and just peace among all nations, and also passed decrees that all land be transferred to the ownership of all the people and be handed over to the working peasants without compensation. The Congress formed the world's first truly people's, workers' and peasants' government, headed by Lenin and with Comrade Stalin participating.
    The news of the victory of the socialist revolution and the news of the birth of the Soviet regime spread throughout the country. The whole country followed Petrograd and Moscow. The great Lenin called this period the triumphal march of Soviet power.
    During the eight months from February to October 1917, the Lenin-Stalin Party completed enormous and extremely difficult work—winning over the majority in the working class and the Soviets, and attracting millions of peasants to the socialist revolution. The Party snatched the working people away from the influence of the petty-bourgeois parties of the Mensheviks, Socialist-Revolutionaries, and anarchists, and thoroughly exposed the policies of these parties aimed against the interests of the working people. The Party carried out tremendous political work on the front lines and in the rear, and prepared the masses for the October Socialist Revolution. Under the brilliant leadership of Lenin and Stalin, the Bolshevik Party was adept at merging the general democratic movement of all nationalities for peace, the democratic movement of peasants to seize the land of landlords, the national liberation movement of the oppressed nationalities of Russia for national equality, and the socialist movement of the proletariat to overthrow the bourgeoisie and establish the dictatorship of the proletariat into a single revolutionary torrent. All of this thoroughly resolved the fate of capitalism in Russia.
    The October Socialist Revolution seized the means of production from the landlords and capitalists and turned the land, factories, railways, and banks into the socialist property of all the people. The October Revolution established the power of the working people in the country in the name of the Soviets. The October Revolution led all the people of Russia, freed from capitalism and national oppression, onto a new and happy life. The victory of the Great October Revolution was the victory of the Lenin-Stalin doctrine on proletarian revolution. The October Revolution fundamentally changed the face of the world, dividing the whole world into two systems—the socialist system and the capitalist system. In the Soviet state, for the first time in history, the working people firmly defeated the exploiters and oppressors. A new Soviet state—a state of the working people, created by the genius of Lenin and Stalin—was established on one-sixth of the land of the world, and this state became a powerful tool in the hands of the working class and all the people for building a socialist society.
    The Great October Socialist Revolution freed the Russian people from the enslavement of international imperialism. The working people of the young Soviet Republic defeated the armies of foreign interventionists, who colluded with domestic counter-revolutionary forces to try to restore the power of the exploiters in our country. The Soviet regime realized the long-cherished aspirations of the working people. They gained peace and freedom, they became equal and true masters of their own lives, and became builders of a socialist society. The Soviet state, led by the Communist Party, broke free from the oppression of imperialism and rapidly embarked on the road of victorious socialist construction. Lenin said on the day of the victory of the October Revolution: "A new stage in Russian history has come from now on, and this third Russian revolution will definitely lead to the victory of socialism in the end" (Russian edition of Lenin's Collected Works, Volume 26, page 208). The genius of the founder and leader of the Communist Party and the Soviet state has been realized. Under the leadership of Stalin—the great successor to Lenin's cause—the Communist Party led the Soviet people to the victory of socialism in a short historical period. The socialist society of the Soviet Union is a living embodiment of the ideas of Lenin and Stalin.
    In the thirty-five years since the victory of the October Socialist Revolution, tremendous changes have taken place in the lives of all nationalities. The Soviet people built socialism, defended the freedom and independence of their motherland in the cruel war against the German fascist aggressors, rapidly restored the economy destroyed by the war, and are now enthusiastically building the material and technical foundations of communism. As a result of the world-historical victory of the Soviet Union in the Great Patriotic War and the liberation struggles of the oppressed nations, China, Korea, and Vietnam in Asia, and Poland, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania, and Albania in Europe, all broke free from the imperialist system. Together with the Soviet Union, they formed a unified and powerful democratic camp confronting the imperialist camp. The Soviet Union naturally leads this peace-loving democratic camp, and the Soviet Union firmly and consistently defends the policy of maintaining and consolidating peace among all nations. The forward development of the world workers' movement and the national liberation struggles of the people in colonies and dependencies proves the invincibility of the ideas of the Great October Revolution.
    The magnificent achievements of the communist builders of the Soviet Union and the achievements of the people of the people's democratic countries are inspiring the working people of capitalist countries to participate in the victorious struggle for peace, freedom, and democracy. Malenkov said: "Lenin and Stalin's ideas illuminate the tasks and prospects of the struggle of the masses of all countries against imperialism, for peace, democracy, and socialism with the brilliant light of revolutionary theory" ("Pravda," October 6, 1952).
    All progressive humanity associates its best hopes and aspirations with the names of Lenin and Stalin—the inspirers and organizers of the Great October Revolution. (Attached picture)

    列宁和斯大林是伟大十月社会主义革命的领袖和组织者
    苏联历史学硕士  巴赫希耶夫
    苏联各族人民和世界各国的劳动人民热烈地庆祝伟大的十月社会主义革命的三十五周年。伟大的十月社会主义革命开辟了人类历史上的新纪元——资本主义崩溃和共产主义胜利的纪元。在三十五年期间，胜利了的社会主义国家苏联像永不熄灭的火把一样照耀着全世界人民走向自由与幸福的道路。现在，苏联领导着强大的保卫和平与民主的国际阵营。强大的和团结一致的爱好和平的阵营，在历史上第一次出现了。在各资本主义国家里，工人阶级的组织性成长起来，工人、农民、妇女和青年的强大的民主国际组织建立了。进行着维护和平事业的英勇斗争的共产党，成长起来和巩固起来了。各族人民对美帝国主义的仇恨和反抗的浪潮愈益高涨了。美国帝国主义现在不仅是侵略者，而且是竭力到处窒息自由和培植法西斯主义的世界宪兵。
    十月社会主义革命的国际意义、十月社会主义革命对世界历史全部进程影响的力量、它的鼓舞者和组织者列宁和斯大林的伟大以及为他们所创建的英勇的共产党的威力，逐年深远地扩展着。
    在列宁和斯大林的领导下，共产党把广大的劳动群众争取到马克思—恩格斯—列宁—斯大林的不可战胜的旗帜下，并以革命的精神教育他们。列宁和斯大林在与机会主义者和劳动人民的一切敌人的不调和的斗争中，使党获得了锻炼。列宁和斯大林用先进的理论和思想体系、科学的纲领和组织的原则、英明的战略和策略——领导无产阶级进行阶级斗争的科学——把党武装起来了。根据对帝国主义时代阶级力量对比的分析，列宁和斯大林证明了无产阶级能够而且应当是联合农民所实现的资产阶级民主革命的领导者。列宁和斯大林指出了资产阶级民主革命转变为社会主义革命的光辉远景，从而以最新的革命理论丰富了马克思主义。根据对资本主义的垂死阶段——帝国主义的最深刻的分析，列宁和斯大林创造了关于社会主义在一个国家内胜利可能的天才的理论，创建了作为无产阶级专政最好的国家形式的苏维埃政权，确定了作为无产阶级起着领导作用的无产阶级与农民的阶级联盟的特殊形式的无产阶级专政。列宁和斯大林制定了关于民族问题、关于帝国主义时代殖民地的民族革命的完整学说；他们把殖民地的民族问题与推翻资本主义的问题联系起来。
    列宁—斯大林的社会主义革命的理论，指给斗争中的无产阶级以光明的远景，鼓舞起他们在向其本国的帝国主义资产阶级进攻的事业中的主动性。
    列宁—斯大林的党坚定地领导了俄国的工人阶级和农民向沙皇制度和资本主义进攻。一九一七年二月，资产阶级民主革命在俄国战胜了，沙皇制度被推翻了，工农兵代表苏维埃在全国各地产生了。与苏维埃产生同时，资产阶级的临时政府也成立了。在列宁和斯大林的领导下，布尔什维克党展开了广大劳动群众为推翻借孟什维克和社会革命党人的帮助而掌握政权的资产阶级的准备工作。在列宁的“四月提纲”、列宁的演说中和斯大林的著作中所提到的任务，便成为了党和工人阶级的行动纲领。
    在七月以后，当依靠着孟什维克和社会革命党人支持的资产阶级临时政府，在彼得格勒枪杀要求把政权转归苏维埃和停止帝国主义战争的工人和士兵的时候，国内的政治情况急剧地尖锐化了。当时，俄国的经济危机增长了。资本家企图用饥饿的瘦手扼杀俄国的革命。已牺牲了数百万人的第一次世界大战仍在继续进行。一九一七年，帝国主义新野兽和妄图统治世界的美国参加了反对德国的战争。美国的亿万富翁们千方百计地支持俄国的反革命临时政府，并以数十亿美元供给它，以便去镇压俄国的革命和奴役俄国。在这岁月中，俄国资产阶级的反革命临时政府向争取劳动人民的利益而英勇战斗的布尔什维克党进行了残酷的迫害。列宁不得不隐蔽于地下。斯大林挽救了劳动人民的伟大领袖的珍贵生命，使之免受反革命的临时政府的暗探和刽子手的迫害。斯大林保持着与列宁的联系，并直接领导着党的全部活动。在这些困难的条件下，党的第六次代表大会于七月二十六日至八月三日秘密地举行了。代表大会团结在坚持列宁关于社会主义可以在一个国家内胜利的学说的斯大林周围。斯大林坚决地指出了托洛茨基分子和布哈林分子——当时他们还是列宁主义的隐蔽敌人——把俄国的革命停止在资产阶级民主阶段的一切企图。缺少信心的人和投降分子，摇尾乞怜于资本主义的西方和第二国际的机会主义，他们提出了俄国的社会主义革命以西方无产阶级革命为转移的可能性。斯大林在揭穿机会主义者和投降分子时说：“很有可能正是俄国会成为开辟走向社会主义道路的国家……必须抛弃认为只有欧洲才能给我们指示道路的陈腐观念”（俄文版“斯大林传略”第六十三页—六十四页）。
    在斯大林的领导下，遵照着列宁的指令，第六次代表大会把共产党指向武装起义，指向在俄国实现无产阶级专政。
    列宁和斯大林勇敢地和自信地、坚定地和谨慎地把党和工人阶级引向社会主义革命。
    十月七日，列宁秘密地来到彼得格勒。他完全赞同斯大林所制定的武装起义的计划。十月十日召开了中央委员会会议，在会议上，列宁作了报告并提出了武装起义的历史性的决议。中央委员会拒绝了反对武装起义的叛徒季诺维也夫、加米涅夫和托洛茨基的投降建议，通过了列宁的决议并动手促其实现。十月十六日，中央委员会选举了以斯大林为首的领导起义的党中央。
    无论动员了一切反革命的力量，无论美国、英国和法国的帝国主义分子对临时政府的帮助，无论是把布尔什维克党的计划出卖给资产阶级的季诺维也夫、加米涅夫和托洛茨基的叛变——无论什么都已不能制止社会主义革命的向前发展。十月二十四日出版的布尔什维克报纸“工人之路”发表了斯大林同志号召群众推翻临时政府的文章。从十月二十五日到二十六日的夜间，工人——赤卫队、革命的军队和水兵，遵照列宁和斯大林的号召进攻冬宫，并逮捕了克伦斯基的反革命政府。
    “阿芙乐尔”巡洋舰以自己的炮声，宣告了一九一七年十月二十五日是伟大的社会主义革命的开始。十月二十五日（公历十一月七日）夜间在劳动人民所向无敌的武装起义正酣的时候，第二次苏维埃代表大会宣告了国内一切政权转归工人、农民和士兵代表的苏维埃手中。代表大会通过了停战和建立各民族之间的民主的、公正的和平法令，还通过了一切土地转归全人民所有和无报酬地交归劳动农民使用的法令。代表大会组成了世界上第一个真正人民的、工农的、以列宁为首的有斯大林同志参加的政府。
    关于社会主义革命胜利的消息，关于苏维埃政权诞生的消息在全国传布开了。全国都追随着彼得格勒和莫斯科。伟大的列宁把这个时期叫做苏维埃政权的凯旋行进。
    从一九一七年二月到十月这八个月期间，列宁—斯大林党完成了巨大的和极困难的工作——在工人阶级中和苏维埃中争取到大多数，并把数百万农民吸引到社会主义革命方面来。党从孟什维克、社会革命党人、无政府主义者的小资产阶级政党的影响下把劳动人民夺取过来，并彻底地揭露了这些政党旨在反对劳动人民利益的政策。党在前线与后方展开了巨大的政治工作，并为十月社会主义革命准备了群众。在列宁和斯大林的英明领导下，布尔什维克党善于把各族人民争取和平的总的民主运动、争取夺取地主土地的农民民主运动、被压迫的俄国各族人民争取民族平等的民族解放运动和无产阶级争取推翻资产阶级确立无产阶级专政的社会主义运动汇合成一条总的革命洪流。所有这些彻底地解决了俄国资本主义的命运。
    十月社会主义革命从地主和资本家那里夺取了生产资料并把土地、工厂、铁路、银行变成全人民的、社会主义的财产。十月革命在国内确立了以苏维埃为名的劳动人民的政权。十月革命使摆脱了资本主义和民族压迫的俄国全体人民走上新的、幸福的生活。伟大的十月革命的胜利，就是列宁—斯大林关于无产阶级革命学说的胜利。十月革命根本改变了世界的面貌，把全世界分成了两个制度——社会主义制度和资本主义制度。在苏维埃国家中，劳动人民有史以来第一次牢固地战胜了剥削者和压迫者。在世界六分之一的土地上确立了为列宁和斯大林的天才所创造的新的苏维埃国家——劳动人民的国家，这个国家在工人阶级和全体人民的手中成为建设社会主义社会的强有力的工具。
    伟大的十月社会主义革命使俄国人民免于国际帝国主义的奴役。年青的苏维埃共和国的劳动人民击溃了外国干涉者大军，这些外国干涉者们勾结着国内反革命的力量企图在我国恢复剥削者的政权。苏维埃政权实现了劳动人民的宿愿。他们得到了和平和自由，他们成了自己生活的平等的和真正的主人，成为社会主义社会的建设者。为共产党所领导的苏维埃国家，从帝国主义的压制中挣脱出来，急速地步入胜利的社会主义建设的道路。列宁在十月革命胜利日说过：“俄国历史上的新阶段从此而来到，这个第三次俄国革命最后一定能导致社会主义的胜利”（俄文版列宁全集第二十六卷，二○八页）。共产党和苏维埃国家的奠基者和领袖的天才预见实现了。在斯大林——列宁事业的伟大继承者——的领导下，共产党在短的历史期间内把苏联人民引向了社会主义的胜利。苏联的社会主义社会，就是列宁和斯大林思想的活生生的体现。
    从十月社会主义革命胜利日以来的三十五年中，在各族人民的生活中发生了巨大的变化。苏联人民建设了社会主义，在与德国法西斯侵略者的残酷的战争中保卫了祖国的自由与独立，迅速地恢复了为战争所破坏的经济，现在正热烈地建设共产主义的物质—技术基础。由于苏联在伟大的卫国战争中所获得的全世界历史性的胜利和被压迫各民族的解放斗争的结果，在亚洲的中国、朝鲜、越南，在欧洲的波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、保加利亚、匈牙利、罗马尼亚和阿尔巴尼亚都从帝国主义的制度中挣脱出来。它们和苏联共同组成了与帝国主义阵营对抗的统一的强有力的民主阵营。苏联很自然地领导着这个爱好和平的民主阵营，苏联坚定地和始终不渝地保卫着维持和巩固各民族之间的和平的政策。世界工人运动和殖民地、附属国的人民的民族解放斗争的向前发展的进程，证明了伟大的十月革命的思想的不可战胜性。
    苏联的共产主义建造者的宏伟成就，各人民民主国家人民的成就，鼓舞着资本主义国家的劳动人民参加争取和平、自由和民主的胜利斗争。马林科夫说：“列宁和斯大林的思想以革命理论的灿烂光辉照亮着各国人民大众反对帝国主义、争取和平、民主和社会主义的斗争的任务和远景”（一九五二年十月六日“真理报”）。
    全体进步人类把自己最好的希望和意向与列宁和斯大林——伟大十月革命的鼓舞者和组织者的名字联系在一起。（附图片）
