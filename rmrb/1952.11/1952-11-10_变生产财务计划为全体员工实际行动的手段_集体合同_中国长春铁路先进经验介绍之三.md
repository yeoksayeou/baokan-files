The Means of Transforming Production and Financial Plans into Practical Actions for All Employees – Collective Contracts
—Introduction to the Advanced Experience of Changchun Railway in China (Part 3)
He Jiqun, Chairman of the China Railway Union, Central-South District Committee
Song Ligang, Assistant Director of the China Changchun Railway Bureau

    In order to fulfill and overfulfill the production and financial plans, and in order to enhance the sense of responsibility of administrative departments and trade union organizations for improving the material living standards and cultural health of workers, engineers, technicians, and staff of the enterprise, the Changchun Railway administrative departments and all employees signed collective contracts in both 1951 and 1952. In the collective contracts, the enterprise administration and all employees, represented by the trade union, put forward guarantee conditions. In the 1951 collective contract, employees guaranteed to fulfill 100% of the state transportation plan's loading quota and 100% of the quality of loading important materials, stipulating that the cost per converted ton-kilometer would not exceed 73.1 yuan. Regarding cadre training, it was stipulated that 4,730 new cadres would be trained. In terms of employee welfare, the administration specifically stipulated the amount of money allocated for building housing, the construction area, the location, etc., and also stipulated the purchase of 3,450 tons of potatoes, 36 tons of fish, 500 tons of soybean oil... etc., for employee meals.
    The signing of the collective contract was warmly welcomed by the employees. When the 1951 collective contract was submitted to all employees for discussion, they raised 6,074 suggestions, of which 65% were related to production improvements and 35% were related to welfare, living, and cultural demands. All of these more than 6,000 suggestions were resolved. Among them, 3,484 suggestions were entered into the special registers of grassroots units; 1,736 suggestions were entered into the special registers of the sub-bureaus; and 453 suggestions were submitted to the Bureau for joint consultation and resolution by the trade union and the administration. Therefore, the employees were very excited. Sun Guocai of Daguantun Station excitedly said, "This contract is like the law, and like parents taking care of their children." Han Xishan, an old worker at the Dashiqiao Locomotive Depot, said, "In the past, workers made guarantees to the administration on how to complete the production plan, but the administration never guaranteed anything to the workers; this time, both sides have guarantees, and even things that the workers didn't think of have been stipulated!" As a result, employees were particularly concerned about production, and they put forward guarantee conditions and rationalization proposals, demanding to overfulfill the state plan. This not only enhanced the spirit of responsibility of the cadres of various business organizations to the country and the workers, but also made the workers more deeply aware of their position as masters of the country. They often inquired about the progress of the contract's fulfillment, sharply criticized personnel and organizations that did not conscientiously implement the contract, and put forward various suggestions for improving production and work.
    After the Changchun Railway signed the collective contract, the bureau director personally convened a telephone conference attended by cadres at all levels and reported on how to implement the contract at the cadre meetings of each sub-bureau and station/depot. Each sub-bureau also organized cadres at all levels to study and discuss the collective contract. For example, after studying the collective contract, the Hailar Sub-district Trade Union organized four working groups to publicize the collective contract along the line. The Dalian, Mudanjiang, and Harbin Sub-bureaus also convened cadre meetings to implement the collective contract. Due to the widespread publicity, the masses understood the collective contract and strengthened their conviction in its implementation.
    In order to fulfill the collective contract, the administration and trade union of Changchun Railway launched a large-scale production competition in earnest. Based on the production and financial plans, all employees put forward guarantee conditions for competition within their units and individually. At the end of 1950, the number of people participating in the competition was 18,176, and by the end of 1951, it had increased to 60,859, reaching 83,131 in September of this year. This truly mass-based, large-scale production competition ensured the fulfillment of the collective contract.
    In the process of implementing the collective contract, Changchun Railway conducted mass inspections. With the help of Soviet experts, they inspected each clause of the collective contract and each item in the special registers according to the contract; they criticized those that were not implemented or not thoroughly implemented and set deadlines for completion. When the Shenyang Sub-bureau inspected the collective contract, they conducted a pilot project at the Changchun Locomotive Depot. The cadres participating in the inspection studied the "Mass Inspection of the Implementation of Collective Contracts" by Soviet author Gudkov, and also studied the methods of mass inspection of collective contracts with Soviet experts. Then, under the auspices of the trade union in the depot, six inspection groups were established to mobilize the masses to make suggestions. The trade union was to sort out the suggestions made by the masses, submit them to the inspection group for study, and then send them to the relevant departments for resolution. After the pilot project, a general inspection was carried out in all units of the entire sub-bureau. This kind of mass inspection is of great significance for implementing the collective contract.
    Because the business of the railway is extraordinarily complex and the relationship between the various units is very close, it is necessary to require the entire bureau to implement the collective contract in a consistent manner, and it is necessary to stipulate the collective contracts and contact contracts for each station, depot, and factory. Each unit also had to distribute the draft contact contract to each production team. Based on their own scope of work, the teams and individuals put forward guarantee conditions, and then held a regional conference to sign the contact contracts. In order to ensure the balance of work in each workshop, the grassroots trade unions also launched workshops and teams to establish contact contracts with each other. Due to the close cooperation between the units and teams, the joint labor organization was strengthened and transportation efficiency was improved.
    The experience of Changchun Railway in signing collective contracts is successful. In the process of signing and implementing collective contracts, the main experiences are:
    First, the drafting and preparation of the collective contract should be carried out from top to bottom, in an organized and led manner. This is the primary step in drawing up a good collective contract. It is necessary to base it on the production and financial plans, with each department putting forward specific measures and guarantees to complete the state plan, and to resolve employee problems in an organized and led manner based on government decrees, production and financial plans, and state allocations. Only in this way can the drafted contract meet the requirements of the administration and all employees, and can it truly transform the production and financial plans into practical actions for all employees.
    Second, after the contract is drafted, all employees must be mobilized to discuss it, and the process of discussing and studying the collective contract is also the process of mobilizing all employees to participate in democratic management, carry out production reforms, and ensure the completion of state tasks. Therefore, if we can earnestly launch a mass movement to discuss the collective contract every year, we will lay a favorable foundation for the completion of the task for that year.
    Third, in the process of implementing the contract, mass inspections must be carried out quarterly. This inspection should preferably be combined with the current production tasks so that it becomes a powerful organizational means to promote production and thus improve the lives of employees. For example, the collective contract inspection work currently being carried out by Changchun Railway is combined with the competition movement launched to welcome the great Soviet October Revolution Day and to ensure the completion of the fourth quarter and the entire year's production and financial plans.
    Fourth, after the collective contract for the entire railway is signed, it is best to sign on-site collective contracts, that is, the collective contracts for each station and depot. Because in the on-site collective contract, the cost of the business unit can be stipulated, and the conditions can be stipulated more specifically to solve specific problems in production and among the workers. The guarantee conditions stipulated in the collective contract for the entire railway are often the general conditions for the entire railway. Without the on-site contract, there will be certain limitations in solving problems more specifically and in contacting the masses more closely. Therefore, it is necessary to sign an on-site contract.
    Fifth, leaders at all levels must attach importance to the collective contract. Because the collective contract is a document that combines the interests of the state and the interests of employees, the administration and the trade union more closely and correctly. It is a specific political education document for the employee masses, and it is an effective tool to ensure the completion of the production and financial plans. If we underestimate its role and do not implement it earnestly, it will become a formality and cause adverse effects.

    变生产财务计划为全体员工实际行动的手段——集体合同
    ——中国长春铁路先进经验介绍之三
    中国铁路工会中长区委员会主席  何计君
    中国长春铁路管理局助理局长    宋力钢
    为了完成和超额完成生产财务计划，为了提高行政部门和工会组织对改善本企业工人、工程技术人员和职员的物质生活以及文化卫生的责任感，中长铁路行政部门和全体职工，在一九五一年和一九五二年均签定了集体合同。在集体合同中，企业行政和以工会为代表的全体员工都提出了保证条件。在一九五一年度的集体合同中，职工保证百分之百地完成国家运输计划的装车数，而且百分之百地保证重要物资的装车质量，并规定每一换算吨公里的成本不高于七十三点一元。在培养干部方面，规定培养新干部四千七百三十人。在员工福利方面，行政方面具体地规定了修筑住宅的钱数、建筑面积、地区等，也规定了要购买马铃薯三千四百五十吨，鱼三十六吨，豆油五百吨……等等用在职工伙食方面。
    集体合同的签订，受到了员工热烈的欢迎。一九五一年集体合同交给全路员工讨论时，员工们提出了六千零七十四条意见，其中有关生产改进的占百分之六十五，有关福利、生活和文化要求的占百分之三十五。这六千多条意见，都得到了解决。其中有三千四百八十四条意见注入基层单位的特别清册中；有一千七百三十六条意见注入分局的特别清册中；有四百五十三条意见提到管理局，由工会和行政共同协商解决。因此，员工们非常兴奋。大官屯车站孙国才兴奋地说：“这个合同像法律一样，又像父母照顾孩子一样。”大石桥机务段老工友韩喜山说：“过去工人向行政提出保证怎样来完成生产计划，就没有提出过行政向工人保证什么；这次双方都有保证，连工人没有想到的都给订上啦！”因而员工对生产特别关心，纷纷提出保证条件和合理化建议，要求超额完成国家计划。这就不仅提高了各业务机构的干部对国家和工人负责的精神，同时也使工人们对于主人翁的地位体贴得更深刻。他们常常询问合同的完成情况，对于不认真执行合同的人员与机关进行尖锐的批评，并提出各种改进生产与工作的意见。
    中长铁路签订集体合同以后，局长亲自召开各级干部参加的电话会议，并且在各分局和站、段的干部会议上，报告如何执行合同的问题。各分局也要组织各级干部学习和讨论集体合同。如海拉尔分区工会在学习集体合同以后，组织了四个工作组分别到沿线宣传集体合同。大连、牡丹江、和哈尔滨分局也都召开了贯彻集体合同的干部大会。由于广泛地进行了宣传，群众就都明白了集体合同，加强了执行集体合同的信念。
    为了完成集体合同，中长铁路的行政和工会认真地展开大规模的生产竞赛。全体员工根据生产财务计划，纷纷提出本单位和个人的竞赛的保证条件。一九五零年底参加竞赛的人数是一万八千一百七十六人，而在一九五一年底增加到六万零八百五十九人，在今年九月份就达到了八万三千一百三十一人。这种真正群众性的大规模的生产竞赛，就保证了集体合同的完成。
    在执行集体合同的过程中，中长铁路进行了群众性的检查。他们在苏联专家的帮助下，按照集体合同的条文和合同中的特别清册的各个项目，逐条检查；对未执行的和执行不彻底的要进行批评，并要限期完成。沈阳分局检查集体合同时，在长春机务段进行了试点。参加检查的干部学习了苏联古得阔夫著的“集体合同履行情况的群众性检查”，又和苏联专家研究了群众性的检查集体合同的方法，然后在该段工会主持下，成立了六个检查组，发动群众提意见。工会要把群众提出的意见加以整理，交检查组研究后，送给有关部门解决。在试点之后，便在全分局各单位进行普遍的检查。这样群众性的检查，对于贯彻执行集体合同，是有很大作用的。
    因为铁路的业务是异常复杂的，而各单位的关系是十分密切的，所以必须要求全局实行集体合同的步骤一致，必须要求订出各站、段、厂的集体合同和联系合同。各单位还要把联系合同草案发到各生产小组。小组和个人根据自己的工作范围，提出保证条件，然后再举行地区性的签订联系合同的大会。各基层工会为了保证各车间的工作平衡，又发动车间和小组互相订立联系合同。由于各单位小组之间密切配合，因而加强了联合劳动组织，提高了运输效率。
    中长铁路签订集体合同的经验是成功的。在签订与执行集体合同的过程中，主要的经验是：
    第一，要自上而下，有组织、有领导地进行集体合同的起草准备工作。这是订好集体合同的首要步骤。必须以生产财务计划为基础，各部门提出完成国家计划的具体措施和保证条件，并以政府法令、生产财务计划与国家的拨款情况为依据，有组织、有领导地解决职工的问题，这样起草的合同，才能够符合于行政和全体员工的要求，也才能真正把生产财务计划变为全体员工的实际行动。
    第二，合同起草之后，必须发动全体职工进行讨论，而讨论与研究集体合同的过程，也就是发动全体员工参加民主管理，进行生产改革，保证完成国家任务的过程。因此我们能够每年认真地展开一次群众性的讨论集体合同的运动，我们就能为当年的任务完成奠定了有利的基础。
    第三，在执行合同的过程中，必须按季进行群众性的检查工作。这种检查最好能与当前的生产任务相结合，使之成为推动生产从而改善职工生活的有力的组织手段。譬如目前中长路正在进行的集体合同检查工作，就是和为迎接伟大的苏联十月革命节、保证完成第四季度与全年的生产财务计划而展开的竞赛运动相结合的。
    第四，全路的集体合同签订之后，最好还要签订现场的，即各站、段的集体合同。因为在现场集体合同内，可以规定本业务单位的成本，可以更具体地规定条件，以解决生产上与工人中的具体问题。而全路集体合同所规定的保证条件时常是全路的总括条件。如果没有现场的合同，那么对于更具体地解决问题，更密切地联系群众是有一定的限制的。因此签订现场的合同，是必要的。
    第五，各级领导必须重视集体合同。因为集体合同是使国家利益与职工利益、行政与工会更密切而正确地结合起来的文献，是向职工群众进行具体的政治教育文件，是保证完成生产财务计划的有效工具。如果我们对其作用估计不足，而不去认真地执行，那么就会流于形式，造成不良的效果。
