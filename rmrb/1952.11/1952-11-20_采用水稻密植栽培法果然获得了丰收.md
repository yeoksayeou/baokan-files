    Indeed, Bumper Harvest Achieved by Adopting Close Planting of Rice
    Editor: This spring, one evening, our mutual aid team studied Chen Yongkang's experience in achieving high rice yields as reported in the newspaper. I went back to bed, tossing and turning, thinking: In the past, when I was oppressed and exploited, I also farmed, and I often saw some particularly good rice seedlings, but I didn't have the heart to study the reason behind it. The Communist Party led me to turn over a new leaf, and also led us to engage in production. Our mutual aid team was rated as a model mutual aid team in the county last year, and I myself became the head of the mutual aid team and a labor model in the county. Therefore, I should take the lead in accepting advanced production experiences. I decided to take 1.86 mu of land to experiment with the "small seedling close planting" method. At the mutual aid team meeting, I led the team members to study this method and told everyone my thoughts and determination. Team member Chen Jinfu said: "I have been farming since I was sixteen, and now I am forty. I have never heard of the small seedling close planting method. You should just plant it yourself." I thought: If it grows well, it can be promoted next year. If it doesn't grow well, at most the yield will be reduced a little, but it won't be a complete crop failure. So I was still determined to plant it. When transplanting the seedlings, I asked a few comrades to go with me. At that time, many people came to watch. Chen Jinyuan, who was sixty-four years old, said: "It is useless to plant like this." Many others said sarcastic remarks. But I was not discouraged and still did it. Later, the rice grew thick stalks and lush leaves, and people couldn't even walk through it. When the rice heads bent over, they looked even better. I was very happy. At this time, the reaction of the masses was different. They all said that this rice was the best in the whole village. At harvest time, all the team members came to help me thresh the rice. The 1.86 mu of land yielded a total of 1214 jin of dry rice, an average of 653 jin per mu, an increase of 277 jin compared to last year. Above my field was Jiang Guotu's 1.9 mu of land, which only yielded 560 jin in total. Below was Chen Jinfu's 1.7 mu of land, which averaged 350 jin per mu. Seeing these facts, everyone believed in the benefits of the "small seedling close planting" method. Teng Xianjie, the village production committee member, said: "A tree that is large cannot be blown down by the wind. The 'small seedling close planting' method can indeed increase production. This year I didn't believe it and dared not plant it, but next year I must plant several more mu." Village chief Zhao Peirong said: "To increase production, we must change the old methods and learn new experiences."

### 采用水稻密植栽培法果然获得了丰收

    采用水稻密植栽培法果然获得了丰收
    编辑同志：今年春天一个晚上，我们互助组学习了报上登的陈永康的水稻丰产经验。我回去睡在床上，翻来复去地想：在过去受压迫受剥削的时候，我也种田，也常看到有一些特别好的禾苗，就是没有心思去研究它的道理。共产党领导我翻了身，又领导我们搞生产，我们的互助组在去年被评为县的模范互助组，我自己又当了互助组长，成了县的劳动模范，这就应该带头接受先进生产经验了。我打定主意拿出一亩八分六厘田来试验“小株密植”法。我在互助组会上领导组员研究这个方法，并且把我的想法和决心告诉大家。组员陈金富说：“我十六岁种田，现在四十岁了，没有听说过小株密植法，只有你自己去种吧。”我想：如果种得好，明年可以推广，种得不好，顶多也不过是减产一些，总不会颗粒不收。所以我还是决心要种。插秧时我叫了几个工作同志一道去插，当时有很多人跑来看；六十四岁的陈金元说：“这样种田是没有用的。”还有好多人说讽刺话。但是我没有灰心，还是作了。后来稻子长得梗粗叶茂，人也走不进去。稻头弯钩时，长得更好了。我心里非常高兴。这时群众的反映就不同了，都说这块稻算全村第一。收割时，全体组员都来帮我打稻，一亩八分六厘田，共收了一千二百十四斤干谷，平均每亩收六百五十三斤，比去年增加二百七十七斤。在我这块田上边的是蒋国土的一亩九分田，总共只收了五百六十斤，下边的是陈金富的一亩七分田，平均每亩收三百五十斤。大家看到这种事实，都相信了“小株密植”法的好处。村生产委员滕先杰说：“树多大风吹不倒，‘小株密植’法的确能提高产量，今年我不相信，不敢种，明年一定要多种几亩。”村长赵培荣说：“要增产只有改变老办法，学习新经验。”
