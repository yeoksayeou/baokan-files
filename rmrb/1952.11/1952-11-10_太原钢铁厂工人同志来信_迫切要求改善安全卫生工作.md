    Letter from Workers of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant
    Urgent Request for Improvement of Safety and Health Work
    Editor: We are a group of workers from the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant. Since liberation more than three years ago, our political status has been raised and our lives have improved; but there is still a big knot in our hearts. The labor protection and sanitation work in our factory is really poor, and our health and even our lives are still seriously threatened. We have raised opinions to the factory leadership more than once, requesting to improve the safety and health work in the workshops. The leading cadres do not pay attention to it, and many problems that can be solved have not been solved for a long time, because they do not understand our suffering. We really can't bear it anymore. In order to better improve production, we have to protect our bodies. We hope that you will convey our situation and demands to the Central Government, and be sure to urge the factory leadership to solve our problems as soon as possible.
    Editor: Do you know in what kind of environment we are working? If you come to our rolling mill, you will know: In the rolling mill workshop, the high heat radiated from the heating furnace and the red-hot steel bars is difficult for the human body to resist, especially in summer, when the workshop temperature generally reaches 120 degrees Fahrenheit. Under these circumstances, it is not only difficult to work, but also easy to have accidents. At the employee representative meeting held in April, the workers proposed to install ventilation pipes. The leadership did not accept it and insisted on using the existing electric fans in the factory to blow air. In fact, it is useless to install electric fans. As soon as the electric fan is turned on, the iron filings on the ground and the furnace ash from the heating furnace are blown up, which is both blinding and hinders work, and it also hurts the body to breathe into the lungs. Workers would rather suffer from the heat than dare to turn on the electric fan. What is especially intolerable is that the rolling mill workers work continuously for eight hours in this high-temperature workshop, and even the most basic requirement of drinking cold boiled water was not resolved until September. Is this treating us workers as the masters of the factory? The workers who transport steel ingots are often dazed by the red-hot steel ingots that have just been poured, and even accidents occur; but the administration does not issue suitable high-temperature protective clothing. Under these harsh working conditions, the workers still strive to improve production in the patriotic production competition. They have increased from transporting seven layers of steel ingots per vehicle to nine layers. The workers are working regardless of everything, but the leaders do not care about us, they only know about production tasks. The rolling mill department has such bad labor conditions and poor sanitation work, that the number of work-related injuries and illnesses in August accounted for 54 percent of all employees. This is a serious loss, and it really hurts to talk about it.
    Here, let me tell you about the working environment of the five famous types of workers in our factory – the "Red People", "White People", "Earth People", "Black People" and "Green People": The "Red People" are the workers in the crushing workshop of our iron smelting department. The "Earth People" are the workers in the refractory materials department who crush crucible stones. The "White People" are the workers in the gypsum room. The working environment of these three types of people has not improved at all in the past three years. They are all because the workshop has no dust-proof equipment and no effective protective masks, not only have their clothes and skin changed color, and their eyes have changed color, but even their sputum and feces have changed color. Their bodies have been severely damaged, and many of them have contracted eye diseases, lung diseases, and gastrointestinal diseases. According to the physical examination results of 125 workers in the crucible stone crushing workshop, 38 people have already contracted lung disease, and more than 30 people cough very badly. From July 1950 to September 1952, six old workers with six to ten years of service have died one after another in this workshop due to occupational diseases.
    The "Green People" are the workers in the pitch oil production section of our coking department. Because the ventilation equipment in the coal tar room is not good, the circular machine for making pitch and the pool for storing coal tar are all set up in the workshop. Every time coal tar is produced, the yellow coal tar smoke that comes out will stay in the workshop for three hours; moreover, the chimney of the coal tar pot outside the workshop is low, and the coal tar smoke that comes out also runs into the workshop. In order to watch the machine produce pitch oil, no matter how much oil smoke there is in the workshop, we workers cannot leave the workshop. The pitch smoke, which contains toxic and corrosive properties, first corrodes our faces to a greenish color, then corrodes them and breaks them, oozing yellow water, and finally becomes small scars. Breathing pitch smoke into the lungs also corrodes the lungs. Now, all twelve workers who watch the coal tar pot have contracted lung disease and rib poisoning, and the four workers in the crystallization chamber also have illnesses, and two of them have become "night blind".
    The "Black People" are the workers on our coke ovens. They load coal, push coal and push coke on the hot coke ovens. The old coke ovens emit smoke from all the holes and seams, especially when the furnace cover is opened to load coal every twenty-six minutes, the coal smoke that comes out is even greater. Workers do not have protective masks, and even wearing masks cannot block the coal smoke. The health of the workers has been severely damaged. Now, nine of the furnace loaders have contracted serious lung diseases. After worker Zhang Yushan took a month off due to illness, the sputum he coughed up was still black. It is conceivable how serious the coal gas poisoning is for our workers on the coke ovens. This summer, a leading cadre from our factory came to the coke oven. He shouted that he was dizzy after standing there for less than half an hour and hurried away. Now we want to ask him: "You can't stay on the coke oven for half an hour, but we have to work on the coke oven for eight hours every day. Why have you been ignoring our suggestions for improving the safety and sanitation of the coke oven for the past three years?"
    Many workers in our factory do not have changing rooms. In order to put tools and change work clothes to and from work, we built a shed ourselves with mats and wooden sticks. There are no wardrobes, so we made small wardrobes ourselves with wooden boards. Dirty clothes, stinky socks, and a day's worth of meals are all put together, and the smell is really disgusting. We feel nauseous as soon as we take out our meals. After launching the patriotic health campaign, we repeatedly asked the leaders to solve the problem of wardrobes, and the health inspection team also urged the leaders to solve it, but it has not been resolved.
    There is one more thing to mention. There is a group of workers in our factory who work in the open air and transport ore. Because they do not have a place to rest (there are two mat sheds with furniture and clothes boxes, but no place for people to rest), on sunny days, they rest in the open air in disarray, letting the wind blow and the sun shine; on rainy days, they have nowhere to shelter from the rain, and several people squat together and shiver from the cold. Our leading cadres have never asked or cared about this situation, but they have built a building with a budget for building a rest room for the workers.
    Is there no way to improve the safety and sanitation work in our factory? No. We not only make requests, but also come up with some effective methods, but the leading cadres do not accept them. For example, in order to completely solve the problem of dust inhalation by workers in the crushing workshop of the refractory materials department, we have constantly suggested that leading cadres convert wet grinding to dry grinding. And we know that there are some large materials in the factory that can be used for converting to dry grinding; but for three years, the leading cadres have been delaying this suggestion, or saying that there is no money, and it has not been resolved until today. In order to avoid the problem of workers in the coal tar room getting pitch poisoning, we also made specific suggestions, but because they did not seriously accept the workers' opinions, the problem has not been resolved. For example, in order to solve the problem of workers in the crushing workshop of the iron smelting department inhaling red ore powder, we suggested installing dust-proof equipment next to the hoist and changing the manual sieve to an automatic sieve. Our leading cadres first said that the production task was busy and there was no time to study it; later they said that our suggestion could not completely solve the problem, and just ignored it. In short, our leading cadres not only do not care about the workers' demands for safe production, but also bury the workers' correct suggestions, which makes the factory's safety and sanitation work not improved for a long time, causing serious illnesses and deaths among the workers. The factory's leading cadres should be held responsible for these. We have reason to ask the leading cadres to publicly examine the idea of not paying attention to the workers and to quickly improve the factory's safety and sanitation work.

    太原钢铁厂工人同志来信
    迫切要求改善安全卫生工作
    编辑同志：我们是太原钢铁厂的一群工人。解放三年多以来，我们的政治地位提高了，生活改善了；可就是心里还有一个大疙疸。我们厂里的劳动保护和卫生工作做的实在太差，我们的健康甚至生命还受着严重的威胁。我们不只一次地向厂的领导方面提出意见，要求改善车间的安全卫生工作。领导干部不重视，许多可以解决的问题，长期不给解决，因为他们并不了解我们的疾苦。我们实在忍受不住了，为了更好地提高生产，我们也不得不保护自己的身体。希望你们把我们的情况和要求转告中央，一定要督促厂的领导方面早日解决我们的问题。
    编辑同志：你知道我们是在怎样的环境里工作着？如果你到我们的轧钢部来看看，你就会知道：在轧钢车间里，加热炉和烧红了的钢条放射出来的高热，人的身体是难以抵抗的，特别是夏天，车间温度一般都高达华氏一百二十度。在这种情况下，不仅工作困难，而且容易出事故。在四月间召开的职工代表会议上，工人们提出安装通风管的建议。领导方面不接受，坚持利用厂里既有的电风扇扇风。实在说，安了电扇也用不着。电扇一开，地上的铁屑和加热炉的炉灰都吹起来了，既迷眼睛、有碍工作，呼吸到肺里还有伤身体。工人宁可受热，也不敢开电扇。尤其不能容忍的，轧钢工人在这种高温车间连续工作八个小时，就连最起码的喝凉开水的要求，一直拖延到九月间才得到解决。这是把我们工人当作工厂的主人来看待吗？运搬钢锭的工人，经常被这些新倒出来的通红的钢锭烤得头发昏，甚至发生事故；但行政方面却不发给适用的防护高温的服装。在这种恶劣的劳动条件下，工人们在爱国生产竞赛运动中还是努力提高生产，他们由每车运送七层钢锭增为九层。工人们是在不顾一切地劳动着，领导上却不关心我们，只知道要生产任务。轧钢部就是因为劳动条件太坏，卫生工作太差，八月份工伤、疾病人数占全部职工的百分之五十四。这是多严重的损失，说起来真是心疼。
    这里，再把我们厂里有名的五种工人——“红人”“白人”“土人”“黑人”“青人”的劳动环境说给你们听听：“红人”是我们炼铁部破碎工场的工人。“土人”是耐火材料部粉碎坩子石的工人。“白人”是石膏房的工人。这三种人的工作环境，三年多以来没有一点改善。他们都是因为车间没有防尘设备，没有有效的防护面具，不仅衣服和皮肤变了色，眼睛变了色，连吐的痰和大便也都变了色。他们的身体已经受到了严重的损害，其中许多人得了眼病、肺病和肠胃病。据粉碎坩子石车间一百二十五个工人的身体检查结果，现在已有三十八人得了肺病，有三十多人咳得很厉害。从一九五○年七月到一九五二年九月，这个车间先后因职业病已经死了六个六年至十年工龄的老工人。
    “青人”是我们炼焦部副产股制沥青油的工人。因为焦油房的通风设备不好，制沥青的圆型机和装焦油的池子都设在车间内，每当出一次焦油时，冒出来的黄色的焦油烟就要在车间里停留三个小时；而且车间外边的焦油锅的烟筒低，冒出来的焦油烟也跑到车间里来了。为了看机器生产沥青油，车间里的油烟怎样多，我们工人也不能离车间，含有毒质和腐蚀性能的沥青烟，先把我们的脸腐蚀成青色，然后就腐蚀破了，流黄水，最后成了一块一块的小疮疤。沥青烟呼吸到肺里，把肺也腐蚀坏了。现在，我们看焦油锅的十二个工人都得了肺病和肋骨中毒病，结晶室的四个工人也都有了病，而且两个人已变成了“夜盲”。
    “黑人”是我们炼焦炉上的工人。他们在火热的焦炉上装煤、推煤和推焦炭。老旧的炼焦炉，各个孔缝都往外冒烟，特别是每隔二十六分钟把炉盖打开装煤时，冒出来的煤烟更大。工人们没有防护面具，带上口罩也隔不住煤烟薰，工人们的健康受到了严重的损害。现在装炉工人已经有九个人得了严重的肺病。工人张玉山得病休养一个月以后，吐出痰还是黑色的。可想而知，我们工人在焦炉上中的煤气毒是多么严重。今年夏天，我们厂里的一位领导干部来到焦炉上，没站半小时，就喊头昏，急忙跑下去了。现在我们要问他：“你在焦炉上不能停留半小时，我们每天却要在焦炉上劳动八小时。你为什么三年来对我们改善焦炉安全卫生的建议一直是不理呢？”
    我们厂里有许多工人没有更衣室。为了放工具和上下班更换工作衣服，我们自己用席子和木棒子搭起了一座席棚子。没有放衣服柜子，我们自己用木板钉了小衣柜。脏衣服、臭袜子和一天的饭都放在一起，臭味实在难闻，我们一拿出饭来就呕心。开展爱国卫生运动后，我们再三要求领导上解决衣服柜子，卫生检查组也催促领导同志解决，但也没有得到解决。
    还有一件事要提一提，我们厂里有一批在露天工作的、运搬矿石的工人，他们因为没有休息的房子（有两间席棚子，放着家具和衣服箱子，没有人休息的地方），晴天时，东倒西卧地在露天里休息，任凭风吹日晒；下雨天，无处避雨，一个劲儿叫雨淋，几个人蹲在一起冻的直发抖。我们的领导干部对于这种情况从来不闻不问，熟视无睹，却把一笔给工人盖休息室的预算，建筑了一座楼房。
    我们工厂的安全卫生工作，是不是没有办法改善呢？不是的。我们不仅提出要求，而且想出一些有效的办法，可就是领导干部不接受。譬如：为了彻底解决耐火材料部粉碎车间工人呼吸尘土的问题，我们曾不断建议领导干部把湿碾改装成干碾。而且我们知道厂里有一些大件材料，可以作改装干碾用；可是三年来领导干部对这个建议一味拖延，要不就是说没有钱，直到今天也没解决。为避免焦油房工人中沥青毒的问题，我们也提了具体建议，因为他们没有认真地接受工人的意见，问题还是没解决。再如：为了解决炼铁部粉碎工场工人呼吸红矿石粉的问题，我们建议在卷扬机旁安装防尘设备，把人工筛子改成自动筛子。我们的领导干部先是说生产任务忙，没时间研究；后来又说我们的建议不能彻底解决问题，就这样置之不理了。总之，我们的领导干部不仅不关心工人对安全生产的要求，而且埋没了工人的正确建议，这就使得厂里的安全卫生工作长期没有改善，造成了工人严重的疾病和死亡事故，这些都应该由厂的领导干部负责任。我们有理由要求领导干部公开检查不重视工人的思想，赶紧改善工厂的安全卫生工作。
