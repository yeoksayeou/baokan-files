    Beijing Grain Company's Yongdingmen South Warehouse Should Not Neglect the Safety of Stevedores
    Comrade Editor: The administrative leaders of the Yongdingmen South Warehouse of the China Grain Company's Beijing branch neglect safety work. During the safety campaign in July, the stevedores, based on work needs, submitted a budget and specific plans to the warehouse's administrative leaders for adding necessary tools, lighting, and a break room. The administration promised to add these at the time. However, without a thorough inspection later, the warehouse leadership emphasized that there were enough tools and that there was a surplus, so they were not fully supplied. Workers had to wait in two or three teams to use one ladder, and some workers, becoming impatient, found broken ladders and used them after wrapping them with hemp rope. The ditch covers added by the warehouse were mostly made of rotten wood. When workers stepped on them while carrying bags of grain, they would break, causing leg injuries.
    On October 27, when the tool inspection team composed of the Beijing Transportation Company's Joint Safety Production Office and relevant units came to the warehouse for inspection, Director Liu of the warehouse even said that there were 116 ladders and that the ditch covers had been completely supplied. However, after inventory, it was found that most of the ladders and ditch covers were unusable. For example, out of 54 fir ladders, only three could be used. Out of 29 ditch covers, only twelve could be used with difficulty.
    As for the lighting, although seven lamps were purchased, the light poles were very low, and some places were not illuminated. Three months ago, the warehouse decided to build twenty worker rest rooms, but only twelve have been built so far, and the warehouse's more than 300 workers have no place to rest.
    The above problems are very serious, and I hope the administrative leaders of the warehouse will quickly find a way to solve them.

### 北京粮食公司永定门南仓库不应忽视装卸工人的安全

    北京粮食公司永定门南仓库不应忽视装卸工人的安全
    编辑同志：中国粮食公司北京市公司永定门南仓库的行政领导干部忽视安全工作。该仓库在七月份开展安全运动时，装卸工人们曾根据工作需要，向该仓库行政领导提出添置必要的工具、照明、休息室的预算和具体计划，当时行政方面曾答应添设。但后来未经认真检查，该仓库领导方面便强调工具够用，有富余，因之未给添齐。工人在工作中只好两三个小队等待一个梯子使用，有的工人等急了就找破梯子缠上麻绳使用。仓库方面所添的盖沟板，大都是用朽木料作成的，工人扛着粮食包一蹬上去就折断，致摔伤工人的腿。
    十月二十七日北京运输公司安全生产联合办公室和各有关单位所组成的工具检查组，到该仓库进行检查时，该仓库刘主任还说梯子有一百一十六个，盖沟板也添齐了。但经清点后，发现梯子、盖沟板多数不能使用，如杉槁梯子共五十四个，其中能使用的只有三个，盖沟板共二十九块，勉强能用的只十二块。
    至于照明灯，虽然买了七个，但电灯杆很低，好些地方照不到。三个月前该仓库曾决定修建二十间工人休息室，但直到现在只盖了十二间，该仓库有三百多工人没有休息场所。
    上述问题十分严重，我希望该仓库的行政领导干部迅速设法解决。    陈用中
