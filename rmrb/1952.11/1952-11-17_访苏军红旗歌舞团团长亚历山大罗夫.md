Comrade Stalin, whom we deeply respect, has sent one of the Soviet Union's finest musical performance groups – the Soviet Army Red Flag Song and Dance Ensemble – to our country. In recent days, the Red Flag Song and Dance Ensemble's performances in Beijing have been warmly loved by the people of our country. The majestic singing, joyful dances, and beautiful music have left a deep impression on the audience.

The choir members, dressed in gray-green uniforms and wearing red-bordered military caps, stand in neat arcs, with the orchestra seated in front. Almost everyone has medals and honors pinned to their chests, shining gold in the sunlight. This is the radiance of meritorious service to the motherland, the radiance of artistic achievement. When you look at their faces and listen to their singing, you will naturally think of their past. They have experienced arduous struggles. They have traveled all over the vast Soviet land. From Moscow to the distant frontiers, from the southern foothills to the Arctic Ocean, they are welcomed everywhere by the Soviet Army and the Soviet people.

The great poet Neruda once described the Soviet people in a poem with these lines: they are
“Cheerful, brave, steel-like, smiling, always ready to sing, always ready to fight." — The Red Flag Song and Dance Ensemble is composed of just such people.

The Red Flag Song and Dance Ensemble was founded in 1928 and has been in existence for twenty-four years.

When the reporter interviewed the leader of the Red Flag Song and Dance Ensemble, B.A. Alexandrov, he introduced us to the ensemble's development process. This gave us a greater understanding of the ensemble, and therefore made us feel doubly close to it.

When B.A. Alexandrov's father – Alexander Alexandrov – began to create this song and dance ensemble, there were only twelve people: eight singers, two dancers, one conductor, and one person responsible for external liaison. At that time, there were only small performances, and the programs performed were all songs reflecting the life of the troops.

The song and dance ensemble originally belonged to a musical group of the "Frunze Central Red Army House." The "Red Army House" was the center of cultural and recreational activities for the troops at that time.

The Red Flag Song and Dance Ensemble was born in the Soviet Red Army and grew with it. From the very beginning, the ensemble immersed its activities in the life of the troops, often performing in the Red Army's encampments, barracks, border outposts, and warships. The new battle songs and Russian folk dances brought by the performers quickly became popular among the Red Army soldiers.

From the day of its establishment, the song and dance ensemble has continuously drawn endless creative inspiration from the combat life of the Red Army soldiers, from their noble spirit, and has fully expressed its infinite loyalty to the motherland and the Communist Party, heroic spirit, and optimism in its works. Alexander Alexandrov once said: "Our songs are the voice of the Red Army, the heroism of the Red Army, the fortitude of the Red Army, and the Red Army's determination to shed the last drop of blood and breathe the last breath to defend the borders of our motherland, the great cause of Lenin and Stalin." The songs of the ensemble were welcomed by the Red Army from the very beginning, and were loved by soldiers all the way up to Red Army generals Voroshilov and Budyonny.

In 1933, Comrade Stalin saw the performance of this song and dance ensemble. He decided to expand it and instructed that folk songs and classical songs should be added to the program, and that folk instruments should be used. Alexandrov said: "From then on, the song and dance ensemble has greatly developed both in quantity and in quality."

By 1938, the Red Flag Song and Dance Ensemble already had two hundred people. They traveled to every troop garrison. On the lush steppes of Ukraine and in the deserts of Central Asia, in the mountains of the Caucasus and in the forests of Siberia, the inspiring songs of the Red Flag Song and Dance Ensemble could be heard. They not only performed in the troops, but also went to construction areas and remote frontier areas. During 1929, they had been to the vast regions of the Far East. Khabarovsk, Vladivostok, Komsomolsk and Sakhalin all bear their footprints.

In August 1938, Japanese imperialism invaded Soviet territory in the Changkufeng and Lake Khasan areas, and war was raging. The Red Flag Song and Dance Ensemble immediately requested to go to the front. At that time, the Primorsky Krai was being hit by a typhoon, and the roads were flooded. The song and dance ensemble members overcame the difficulties of marching and joined the ranks of fighting to defend the motherland and defend peace.

Ammunition boxes were assembled into a temporary stage, and the musicians sat on haystacks. Fully armed Red Army soldiers sat on the hillside. The surroundings were filled with shell craters, barbed wire, and obstacles. On the calm waters of Lake Khasan, a song of victory resounded:
	
	The panicked enemy soldiers and horses overturned,
	And fled in a hurry across the border.
	On the top of Changkufeng,
	Our red flag flies proudly.
	
Countless lilies grow on the shores of Lake Khasan. The soldiers used these plain flowers to weave wreaths and give them to the performers of the song and dance ensemble. The Red Army soldiers asked the members of the song and dance ensemble to report to Comrade Stalin: The Japanese invaders will never have the opportunity to smell the fragrance of the lilies on the shores of Lake Khasan again.

The performances of the Red Flag Song and Dance Ensemble deeply encouraged the soldiers who were defending the motherland. There are many such vivid stories.

Alexandrov talked about the activities of the Red Flag Song and Dance Ensemble during the Great Patriotic War of the Soviet Union. On June 23, 1941 – the day after the outbreak of the Soviet-German War – the Red Flag Song and Dance Ensemble had already appeared on the battlefield. During the entire war, it had been to every battlefield. Many performers were injured in the war, and some even performed meritorious service. The song and dance ensemble often divided into groups to go to the most intense places of combat, crawling to the positions during heavy artillery fire, or performing on the telephone. This deeply moved the soldiers. They saw that even under severely difficult conditions, the song and dance ensemble still cared about them so much.

Alexandrov said: "We sometimes created songs on the battlefield, and timely compiled the heroic deeds of those who performed meritorious service into songs, and then sang them in the troops."

During rest periods, the song and dance ensemble often helped the troops transport wounded soldiers, assisted the troops in monitoring enemy paratroopers, or accepted other military tasks. Many performers of the song and dance ensemble participated in the Battle of Stalingrad. Vilsky, the dance team leader of the song and dance ensemble who received the reporter together with Alexandrov, won the Red Star Medal for participating in this historic battle. Vinogradov, the choir leader of the song and dance ensemble who was also present, won the Red Star Medal for participating in the Battle of Moscow.

Alexandrov said that the song and dance ensemble not only performed themselves in the troops, but also often held symposiums, gave music lessons, and taught singing. They often held meetings with troop officers to understand and study which songs were popular with the soldiers, how to assist the political education of the troops, and how to strengthen the discipline of the troops. The song and dance ensemble also often sang some light and humorous songs to liven up the spirits and cheer up the emotions of the soldiers.

In the post-war peaceful period, the Red Flag Song and Dance Ensemble actively participated in various domestic political activities together with the people of the whole country, and strived to build a communist society in the Soviet Union and defend world peace. The song and dance ensemble used loud voices to sing praises of peace, sing praises of labor, and sing praises of a beautiful future.

Alexandrov talked about the source of the song and dance ensemble's personnel. Now the song and dance ensemble has two hundred and fifty people, including singers, musicians, and dancers. The song and dance ensemble not only pays attention to finding people with musical or dance talents in the troops, but also goes to cultural and recreational groups in factories and collective farms to find them. After discovering these people, they are then cultivated and trained. Therefore, the personnel of the song and dance ensemble come from various different places.

Alexandrov emphasized: "Our song and dance ensemble not only conducts professional studies, such as practicing singing, playing instruments, and dancing, but we also have political studies. Musicians cannot be people who do not care about politics, musicians must be very cultivated politically."

When talking about the song and dance ensemble's programs and their creative process, Alexandrov said: "In terms of business, why has our Red Flag Song and Dance Ensemble developed so quickly? The main reason is that we have established our creative work on the basis of people's creation. Our creative activities are closely linked to the creation of the people. We not only perform art for the people to see, but also learn from the people. We often record the excellent works of the folk, study them, and carry out artistic processing. In this way, we not only obtain a rich source of creation, but also can constantly create things that belong to the people and are loved by the people. Therefore, we pay great attention to collecting the creation of the people."

"Not only the creation of the Soviet people, but also the creation of other countries." Alexandrov added.

The Red Flag Song and Dance Ensemble's famous song "Along the Mountains, Along the Plains" ("Song of the Far Eastern Guerrillas"), was created based on a folk song popular in the Far East in 1929. This song has a special style. During the singing, there is not only singing, but also imagery. The entire choir sways left and right according to the rhythm of a marching pace. The sound of drums and singing moves from far to near, and from near to far. People seem to see a heroic guerrilla team walking on the mountain paths....

	They defeated the commander-in-chief
	And did not allow the enemy troops to remain
	On the coast of the Pacific Ocean -
	There they ended the battle.

The song is full of lively strength, confidence in victory, and optimism.

The Red Flag Song and Dance Ensemble has more than 500 programs. In addition to Soviet songs, folk songs, and classical works, many songs from fraternal countries have been added in recent years. The Red Flag Song and Dance Ensemble has been to fraternal countries such as Czechoslovakia, Poland, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, the Mongolian People's Republic, and the German Democratic Republic, and has also been to France and Finland.

Alexandrov said: "Our performances in fraternal countries have played a great role in the further rapprochement between us and the people of these countries. Because art comes from the people, it is the soul of the people, and it can be understood and accepted by the people of all countries. Our performances have allowed them to see the achievements of socialist art with their own eyes, and have deepened their understanding of the Soviet Union. At the same time, we have also learned about the art of these countries and promoted cultural exchanges."

The reporter asked him to talk about his own creative life. Alexandrov was very modest and only briefly talked about some of it.

Alexandrov has written many songs that are very popular among the people and soldiers, such as "Glory to the Great Stalin," "Long Live Our Motherland," "Song of Stalin," "Song of Lenin," "Congratulations on the October Revolution," "Song of Victory," and so on. In commemoration of the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, which was held not long ago, he composed another song, "Ode to the Communist Party." Alexandrov has also created some comedies, such as "Wedding in Malinovka Village," etc. He has written some ballet music and dance music, such as "Left Turn," etc. He has also written symphonies.

Alexandrov graduated from the Moscow State Conservatory of Music in 1929. During the war, he organized a broadcast music group. After his father, Alexander Alexandrov, the author of the Soviet national anthem, passed away in 1946, he took over as the leader of the Soviet Army Red Flag Song and Dance Ensemble. Due to Alexandrov's outstanding contributions to the country and his artistic achievements, from 1946 to the present, the Soviet government has awarded Alexandrov the title of People's Artist, and awarded him the Order of Lenin and the Stalin Prize.

Lomonosov, the deputy leader of the song and dance ensemble who was also present, added that Alexandrov is a leader who participates in practical work. He personally serves as the conductor of the chorus. He also often adapts folk songs. For example, the Czechoslovak song "I'll Come Myself" was greatly welcomed by the Czechoslovak people after he adapted it. Alexandrov is not only a musician, but also a social activist. He is a representative of the Moscow Soviet. He often helps and cultivates young musicians. Some young musicians have won the Stalin Prize due to his cultivation.

Finally, Alexandrov said: "This time, we are participating in the activities of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Month with great excitement and joy. We are willing to perform our art for the Chinese people. On the other hand, we are also prepared to familiarize ourselves with Chinese art. We also want to collect materials in China to compile a Sino-Soviet friendship dance and a friendly dance between the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the Soviet Army. There is no doubt that all of this will further deepen the great friendship between our two peoples."

    访苏军红旗歌舞团团长亚历山大罗夫
    崔奇
    敬爱的斯大林把苏联最优秀的音乐演奏团之一
    ——苏军红旗歌舞团派到我国来了。这几天来红旗歌舞团在北京的演出，受到我国人民的热烈喜爱。雄壮的歌声，愉快的舞蹈，优美的音乐，给观众留下了深刻的印象。
    穿着灰绿色制服、戴着红边军帽的合唱队员们，排着整齐的弧形，前边坐着乐队。几乎每人的胸前都挂着奖章和勋章，它们在阳光里闪着金光。这是为祖国立功的光芒，这是艺术成就的光芒。当你望着他们的面孔，听着他们歌声时，你会自然地想到他们的过去。他们经历过艰苦的斗争。他们走遍了辽阔广大的苏联国土。从莫斯科直到辽远的边疆，从南方山麓直到北冰洋，他们到处都受到苏军和苏联人民的欢迎。
    大诗人聂鲁达曾经在一首诗中用这样的诗句来描写苏联人民：他们是
    “开朗的，勇敢的，钢铁似的，微笑的，随时准备歌唱随时准备作战的。”——红旗歌舞团正是由这些人组成的。
    红旗歌舞团成立于一九二八年，到现在已经二十四年了。
    当记者访问红旗歌舞团领导人鲍·亚·亚历山大罗夫时，他曾向我们介绍了歌舞团的发展过程。这使我们对这个歌舞团有了更多的了解，因此对它感到加倍的亲切。
    当鲍·亚·亚历山大罗夫的父亲——亚历山大·亚历山大罗夫开始创立这个歌舞团时，只有十二个人：八个歌手，两个舞蹈演员，一个指挥，一个负责对外联络的人。那时只有小型的演出，演出的节目都是反映部队生活的歌曲。
    这个歌舞团最初是属于“伏龙芝中央红军之家”的一个音乐团体。“红军之家”是那时部队的文娱活动中心。
    红旗歌舞团诞生在苏联红军中，并和它一起发展壮大。歌舞团一开始就把自己的活动深入部队生活中，经常到红军的宿营地、兵营、边境前哨和军舰上去演出。演员们带来的新的战斗歌曲和俄罗斯的民间舞蹈，很快地就在红军战士们之间流行起来。
    歌舞团自成立的一天起，就一直从红军战士的战斗生活中，从他们的崇高精神中汲取创作的无穷泉源，而使自己的作品充分表现了对祖国和共产党的无限忠诚，英勇精神和乐观主义。亚历山大·亚历山大罗夫曾说：“我们的歌就是红军的声音，红军的豪迈，红军的刚毅，就是红军为保卫我们祖国的边疆、伟大列宁—斯大林的事业而流最后一滴血和吐最后一口气的决心。”歌舞团的歌曲一开始就受到红军的欢迎，从士兵直到红军将领伏罗希洛夫和布琼尼，都喜爱这些歌曲。
    一九三三年，斯大林同志看到了这个歌舞团的演出。他决定把它扩大，并指示要在节目内容方面增加民间歌曲和古典歌曲，要使用民间乐器。亚历山大罗夫说：“从此以后，歌舞团不论在数量上或在质量上，都得到很大的发展。”
    到一九三八年，红旗歌舞团已经拥有二百人了。他们走遍了每个部队的驻扎地。在乌克兰繁茂的大草原上和中亚细亚的荒漠里，在高加索的群山中和西伯利亚的森林地带，都能听到红旗歌舞团的令人振奋的歌声。他们不仅在部队中演出，而且也到建设地区和遥远的边疆地区去。在一九二九年间，他们曾到过远东广大地区。伯力、海参崴、青年城和库页岛，都有他们的足迹。
    一九三八年八月，日本帝国主义在张鼓峰和哈桑湖地区侵犯苏联国土，战争正在进行。红旗歌舞团立刻请求到前线去。那时候东海滨省正受到台风的侵袭，路上大水泛滥。歌舞团团员们克服了行军的困难，加入了保卫祖国、保卫和平的战斗行列。
    弹药箱集成临时舞台，乐师们坐在干草堆上。全副武装的红军战士们坐在山坡上。周围是弹坑、铁丝网、障碍物。在哈桑湖平静的湖水上响起一支胜利之歌：
    惊慌的敌军马仰人翻，
    越过边境慌忙逃窜，
    在张鼓峰的山顶上，
    骄傲地飘扬着我们的红旗。
    哈桑湖畔生长着无数的百合花。战士们就拿这些素色花朵编成的花圈赠给歌舞团的演员们。红军战士们请歌舞团团员们报告斯大林同志：日本侵略者是不会再有机会闻到哈桑湖畔百合花的芬香的。
    红旗歌舞团的演出深深地鼓舞了保卫祖国的士兵们。这样的生动故事是很多的。
    亚历山大罗夫谈起红旗歌舞团在苏联伟大卫国战争时期的活动。一九四一年六月二十三日——苏德战争爆发的第二天，红旗歌舞团就已出现在战场上。在整个战争期间，它去过各个战场。有许多演员在战争中受伤，有的更立了功。歌舞团常常分成小组到战斗最激烈的地方去，在炮火炽烈时就爬着到阵地去，或者在电话中演出。这使士兵们非常感动。他们看到，歌舞团在严重困难的条件下，还是这样关心他们。
    亚历山大罗夫说：“我们有时就在战场上创作歌曲，把立功者的英勇行为及时编成歌子，接着就在部队中演唱。”
    歌舞团在休息时候，常常帮助部队运送伤兵，协助部队监视敌人的伞兵，或接受其他军事任务。歌舞团的许多演员参加过斯大林格勒大会战。和亚历山大罗夫一起接待记者访问的歌舞团舞蹈组长维尔斯基，就因参加过这次具有历史意义的大会战而荣获红星奖章。同时在座的歌舞团合唱队长维诺格拉陀夫因参加莫斯科保卫战而荣获红星奖章。
    亚历山大罗夫说，歌舞团在部队中不仅自己演出，而且常常举行座谈会，讲音乐课，教唱歌。他们常常和部队军官开会，了解和研究那些歌曲受战士欢迎，如何协助部队的政治教育，如何加强部队的纪律。歌舞团也常常演唱一些轻松的诙谐的歌曲，使战士们的精神活跃，情绪愉快。
    在战后和平时期，红旗歌舞团和全国人民一起积极参加国内各种政治生活，为在苏联建立共产主义社会和保卫世界和平而努力。歌舞团用宏亮声音歌颂和平，歌颂劳动，歌颂美好的未来。
    亚历山大罗夫谈到歌舞团人员的来源。现在歌舞团已经有二百五十人，其中包括歌唱家、音乐家和舞蹈家。歌舞团不仅在部队中注意寻找有音乐或舞蹈才能的人，而且也到工厂和集体农庄的文娱团体中去寻找。发现这些人后，再加以培养训练。因此歌舞团的人员是来自各个不同地方的。
    亚历山大罗夫着重地说：“我们的歌舞团不仅进行业务学习，比如练习唱歌、演奏和跳舞等，我们还有政治学习，音乐家不能是不问政治的人，音乐家必须在政治上也很有修养。”
    当谈到歌舞团的节目及其创作过程时，亚历山大罗夫说：“在业务上，为什么我们红旗歌舞团发展得这样快呢？主要由于我们把自己的创作工作建立在人民创作的基础上。我们的创作活动是和人民的创作密切联系起来的。我们不仅把艺术演给人民看，而且向人民学习。我们常常把民间的优秀作品纪录下来，加以研究，进行艺术上的加工。这样我们就不但取得丰富的创作泉源，而且可以不断地创作出属于人民、为人民所喜爱的东西来。因此我们非常注意搜集人民的创作。”
    “不仅是苏联人民的创作，而且包括其他各国人民的创作。”亚历山大罗夫又加上一句说。
    红旗歌舞团的著名歌曲“沿着高山，沿着平原”
    （“远东游击队之歌”），就是根据一九二九年间在远东流行的民间歌曲而创作的。这个歌子具有一种特殊的风格。在演唱时，不但有歌声，而且有形象，整个合唱队按着仿佛进军步伐的节拍而左右摆动。鼓声和歌声由远而近，又由近而远。人们好像看到一支英勇的游击队在群山的小路上走过来……。
    他们击败了主将
    不让敌军留在
    太平洋的海岸上——
    在那里他们结束了战斗。
    歌声里充沛着生气勃勃的力量，胜利的信心和乐观精神。
    红旗歌舞团的节目有五百多个。除了苏联歌曲、民歌及古典作品外，最近几年更增加了许多兄弟国家的歌曲。红旗歌舞团曾去过捷克斯洛伐克、波兰、罗马尼亚、保加利亚、匈牙利、蒙古人民共和国、德意志民主共和国等兄弟国家，也去过法国和芬兰。
    亚历山大罗夫说：“我们到兄弟国家去演出，对我们和这些国家人民的进一步接近，起了很大作用。因为艺术是来自人民的，是人民的灵魂，是可以为各国人民所领会和接受的。我们的演出，使他们亲眼看到社会主义艺术的成就，使他们加深了对苏联的了解。同时，我们也了解了这些国家的艺术，促进了文化交流。”
    记者要求他谈谈他自己的创作生活，亚历山大罗夫非常谦虚，只简单地讲了一些。
    亚历山大罗夫曾写过许多歌曲，在人民和战士中间非常流行，比如“伟大的斯大林光荣”、“我们的祖国万岁”、“斯大林之歌”、“列宁之歌”、“祝十月革命”、“胜利歌”等。为了纪念不久以前召开的苏联共产党第十九次代表大会，他又作了一首“歌颂共产党”。亚历山大罗夫也创作了一些喜剧，如“在马林诺夫卡村的婚礼”等。他写过一些巴蕾舞曲和舞曲，如“左拐子”等。他也写过交响曲。
    亚历山大罗夫于一九二九年毕业于莫斯科国立音乐学院。在战时曾组织广播音乐团。一九四六年他的父亲、苏联国歌的作者亚历山大·亚历山大罗夫逝世后，他就担任苏军红旗歌舞团的领导人。由于亚历山大罗夫对国家的卓越贡献和在艺术上的成就，从一九四六年到现在，苏联政府授给亚历山大罗夫以人民演员称号，并奖给他列宁勋章和斯大林奖金。
    同时在座的歌舞团副团长罗蒙诺索夫补充说：亚历山大罗夫是一位参加实际工作的领导者，他亲自担任合唱的指挥。他还常常改编民间歌曲。比如捷克斯洛伐克的歌子“我自己来吧”，经他改编后，大受捷克斯洛伐克人民的欢迎。亚历山大罗夫不仅是一位音乐家，还是一位社会活动家，他是莫斯科苏维埃的代表。他经常帮助和培养青年的音乐家，有的青年音乐家由于他的培养，获得了斯大林奖金。
    最后，亚历山大罗夫说：“这次我们以非常兴奋和愉快的心情来参加中苏友好月的活动，我们愿把我们的艺术演给中国人民看。另一方面，我们也准备熟悉中国的艺术。我们还想在中国搜集材料，编一个中苏友好舞和中国人民解放军与苏军友好舞。毫无疑问，所有这些都将更进一步加深我们两国人民之间的伟大友谊。”（附图片）
