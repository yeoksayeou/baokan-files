    Demobilized Soldier Chang Qingquan Takes the Lead in Draining Water and Planting Wheat
    Comrade Editor: Zhuwan and Xihu and three other villages in the third district of Xihua County, Henan Province, are located in a low-lying area. This autumn, there was a lot of rain, and the land was generally flooded with three to four feet of water. If the water is not drained quickly, wheat cannot be planted. Demobilized soldier Chang Qingquan and the local township cadres came up with a solution: taking advantage of the decline in the water level of the Dongying River, a gap was dug in the north embankment of the Ying River to allow the accumulated water to flow out, guaranteeing wheat planting for the people of the five villages. After the plan was determined, Chang Qingquan led the young and strong men of the whole village to dig the embankment first. He dug the soil very actively. When the gap was almost dug, the soil on both sides of the gap suddenly collapsed, burying Chang Qingquan and Township Head Dong in the soil. Chang Qingquan was seriously injured, but he still did not forget to dig the embankment. Encouraged by his active spirit, all the laborers worked hard and, in less than three days, dug a drainage ditch fifty meters long, two meters wide, and three meters deep, quickly draining the accumulated water. The people of the five villages have all planted wheat according to plan.

    转业军人常清泉积极带头排水种麦
    编辑同志：河南省西华县三区朱湾、西湖等五村地势低洼，今年秋天雨水又多，地里普遍积有三四尺深的水，如不赶快把积水排出，就种不上麦子。转业军人常清泉和本乡干部共同想出办法：趁东颍河水势下降的时候，把颍河北堤挖开一个缺口，使积水流出去，保证五村人民种麦。计划确定以后，常清泉带领全村青壮年，首先上堤挖土。他挖土很积极，缺口快挖好了，缺口两边的土块忽然塌下来，把常清泉和董乡长压在土里。常清泉伤势很重，但他还是不忘掘堤。全体民工在他的这种积极精神的鼓舞下，努力挖掘，不到三天，就挖成一条五十公尺长二公尺宽三公尺深的排水沟，很快就把积水排出去了。五村人民都按计划种上了麦子。
