    Those Who Spread the Seeds of Michurin
    – How Soviet Agricultural Experts Help Us Work
    Hua Shu
    When we happily sing of our beloved motherland, we naturally think of the countless agricultural labor models emerging on that vast land, and the high-yield records they have created: more than 1300 catties of wheat per mu, 1700 catties of rice, and more than 900 catties of cotton... Only three years after the founding of New China, the total output of major agricultural products has exceeded the highest pre-war production level. Our experience in high-yield farming is constantly being promoted and improved, and our agricultural production has unlimited prospects.
    Looking back three years ago, when the first Soviet agricultural expert to come to China, Lysenko, initially introduced us to the Soviet high-yield records, many agricultural technicians expressed doubts, thinking that the translation comrades had miscalculated. Due to the long-term limitations of feudal relations of production and the influence of the reactionary theory of the bourgeois "law of diminishing returns," at first everyone was unable to imagine the leap-forward development of agricultural productive forces. Today, our agricultural production and agricultural science have begun to stride forward, and we cannot but thank the advanced Soviet experience and the hard work of Soviet experts for their help. Soviet experts not only introduced us to the progressive theories and technologies of Soviet agriculture, but also brought us a work ethic worthy of emulation.
    Starting from reality is the first characteristic of Soviet experts' work. They believe that the first difficulty they encounter in their work is their lack of understanding of China's natural conditions and farming habits. Therefore, shortly after Lysenko arrived, he went to the rural areas of Northeast, North, East, and Central-South China for a long period of investigation and research; crop breeding expert A. Ivanov, when he came to China in early February this year, everyone asked him to immediately open a training class, because he was the first person to systematically introduce Michurin's theory, but he asked that he only formally start the class after he had made a nationwide survey of major agricultural areas and had a thorough discussion with Chinese experts.
    Before liberation, the theories and working methods of our agricultural research institutions were all copied from capitalist countries such as Britain and the United States. The experimental projects of an agricultural experiment station were often completely unrelated to the actual needs of local farmers. This bias still existed to some extent even after liberation. Once, when A. Ivanov visited a certain experiment station, the technician in charge of a certain breeding experiment praised the advantages of a new variety. A. Ivanov asked him: "So, how about the yield?" He replied: "Everything is good, except the yield is a little poor." A. Ivanov immediately suggested that they correct this practice of talking about experimental varieties without discussing yield. A. Ivanov has also repeatedly suggested to experiment stations in various places: they must attach importance to the work of selecting good varieties from local varieties, because at least in terms of natural conditions, success has been guaranteed, and they must never concentrate their energy on introducing varieties from distant places and foreign countries. This opinion criticized the erroneous concept of some people in the past who blindly believed in "foreign varieties."
    Contacting the masses is another characteristic of the work of Soviet experts. Among our technicians, many still have technical viewpoints that are more or less purely technical, and they do not know how to rely on the masses. Take livestock epidemic prevention as an example, they always only pay attention to injections, as if there is nothing else to do in epidemic prevention besides injections. Last year, when foot-and-mouth disease occurred in the Northwest region, Soviet veterinary expert Bandalinko participated in this work. After understanding the situation in the epidemic area, the first suggestion he made was to mobilize the masses to implement the blockade, disinfection, and isolation of the epidemic area, and to impart the main epidemic prevention knowledge to the masses. Through the power of the masses, the spread of animal epidemics was quickly extinguished. When he returned, he solemnly told us: "The epidemic prevention team is not a fire brigade, waiting until a fire breaks out there before rushing to rescue it, and the matter is over when the fire is extinguished; instead, we should carry out prevention in advance so that livestock epidemics do not occur."
    In the course of work, Soviet experts pay attention to integrating with the masses. Last year, when Huanghua County, Hebei Province, used aircraft to kill locusts, the 60-year-old Soviet expert Lysenko lived with local cadres and the masses, and got up before dawn every day, stepping through the dew to run ten or twenty miles to observe the effect of pest control. A. Ivanov lectured farmers on the cultivation methods of potatoes in Keshan County, Heilongjiang Province, Northeast China, and while talking, he picked up agricultural tools and went to the fields to work. When they introduce an advanced experience, they not only explain it clearly, but also show you how to do it, for fear that the masses will not understand.
    The Soviet experts who come to our country help us work with a selfless spirit. Expert Qiulnikov, who helped us train tractor and combine harvester drivers, is already over sixty years old. This summer, during the wheat harvest at the Xiaodian State Farm, he was busy everywhere from dawn to night in the hot weather. As long as there was a malfunction in the machinery in the operation area, he would immediately run over to personally inspect and repair it. The Xiaodian State Farm is farming on behalf of nearby farmers. Tian Yongkang, a farmer in his seventies who accepted the farming, was indescribably grateful when he saw this elderly Soviet expert working so tirelessly to help them. One day he suddenly ran to Qiulnikov, grabbed his hand tightly, and kept shouting: "Long live Stalin!"
    "Long live the Soviet elder brother!"
    Veterinary expert En. Ivanov helped us to open training classes, and he rushed to compile teaching materials day and night. Because he had a leg disease that prevented him from sitting for long periods of time, sometimes he had to stand up and lean against the table, writing with one hand and constantly rubbing his sick leg with the other. Crop breeding expert A. Ivanov ruined his eyes due to overwork a few days before the opening of the Michurin training class. The doctor asked him to rest, but he said: "Lecturing only requires the mouth, not the eyes." He still came to class. Animal husbandry expert Toroitsky had a fever due to prolonged outdoor work when lecturing in Chabei last winter. We found a car to send him back to Beijing to rest, but he said: "Comrade Stalin wants us to work, not to rest." He still compiled lectures every night and insisted until the end of the training class.
    The great Soviet friends love the New China as much as they love their own motherland. One day, a fire broke out near Toroitsky's residence, and he immediately ran to help his neighbors put out the fire. Once, Bandalinko visited a livestock farm, which was the season when sheep began to shed their wool in the spring, and wool was scattered everywhere in the corners of the ground. He immediately pointed out to us:
    "This attitude of not valuing state property is not right." Once Qiulnikov found a torn old tarpaulin thrown away in the yard of a state farm. He immediately went to find the responsible cadre of the farm and said: "It would be great to keep this thing for patching the canvas conveyor belt on the combine harvester later."
    Soviet experts are full of enthusiasm and confidence in China's agriculture. Not long ago, when A. Ivanov returned to Beijing from inspecting major agricultural areas, he earnestly told us: "China's agricultural technology has a world status, the problem is how to conduct a good summary." Lysenko said in an article published before his term of office expired and he returned home: New China "Because of the success of the application of advanced Michurin science in Chinese agriculture, its far-reaching prospects are more clearly seen. … The time is not far off when American agricultural science, which was once famous, will also learn progress from Chinese agriculture."
    Seeing the working spirit of the Soviet experts reminds us of the so-called "agricultural experts" sent by imperialists such as the United States and Britain before liberation. Some of them took airplanes to "investigate" the countryside, actually collecting information for imperialism to invade our country. Others sold a set of bourgeois "theories" and "methods" with their eyes closed, and even the specimens for practice were brought from foreign countries. Even more hateful were the various slanders and insults they spread against the Chinese people, in order to create conspiracies of aggression. For example, the report published by the "Sino-American Agricultural Technology Cooperation Group," one of the US invasion organizations in China, openly and shamelessly stated: "The task of reducing population reproduction in China is more important than land reform or improving the living conditions of farmers." This sinister conspiracy to eliminate the Chinese population has been completely crushed by the Chinese people today.

    传播着米丘林种子的人们
    ——苏联农业专家是这样帮助我们工作的
    华恕
    当我们愉快地歌唱着我们可爱的祖国的时候，立刻会很自然地联想到，在那辽阔广大的田野上，正不断地涌现着无数的农业劳动模范和他们所创造的高额丰产纪录：每亩小麦达一千三百多斤，水稻一千七百多斤，棉花九百多斤……。新中国成立才三年，但主要农产品的总产量，都已超过了战前最高的生产水平。我们的丰产经验正在不断地推广和提高，我们的农业生产有无限发展的前途。
    回想三年以前，当第一位来华的苏联农业专家卢森科，首次向我们介绍苏联的高额产量纪录时，不少农业技术干部还表示怀疑，认为是翻译同志折算错了。由于长年封建生产关系的限制和资产阶级“土地报酬递减律”的反动理论的影响，最初大家对农业生产力的飞跃发展是无从想像的。今天我们的农业生产和农业科学的开始大踏步前进，我们不能不感谢苏联先进经验与苏联专家们的辛勤劳动给我们的帮助。苏联专家们不独把苏联农业方面进步的理论和技术介绍给我们，还给我们带来了值得效法的工作精神。
    从实际出发，这是苏联专家工作的第一个特点。他们认为，在他们的工作上首先感到困难的，就是对中国的自然条件与耕作习惯的不了解。所以卢森科来了不久，就到东北、华北、华东、中南各地农村去进行了一次较长时间的调查研究；作物育种专家阿·伊凡诺夫，今年二月初到中国时，大家都要求他立刻开办一个讲习班，因为他是头一个来对米丘林学说进行系统介绍的人，可是他却要求在他作过一次全国主要农业区域的考察，并与中国的专家们缜密地讨论之后，才正式开班。
    解放以前，我国农业研究机关的理论与工作方法，都是从英美那些资本主义国家硬搬来的。一个农业试验场的试验项目，往往与本地农民的实际需要毫无关系。这种偏向，甚至在解放以后，有的还仍然存在。有一次阿·伊凡诺夫参观某一个试验场时，主持某项育种试验的技术人员，向他极力地称赞一新品种的优点。阿·伊凡诺夫问他：“那么，产量怎样呢？”他回答：“什么都好，就只产量差一点。”阿·伊凡诺夫立刻提出建议，要他们纠正这种离开产量，空谈试验良种的作法。阿·伊凡诺夫又不止一次地向各地试验场建议：必须重视从本地品种中去选拔良种的工作，因为那至少在自然条件上，已经获得了成功的保证，决不要把精力集中到从远地和外国引种的工作上去。他这个意见，批判了过去某些人盲目迷信“洋种”的错误观念。
    联系群众是苏联专家工作中的另一个特点。在我们的技术人员中，很多人还有着轻重不同的单纯技术观点，不知道依靠群众。比如说牲畜的防疫工作吧，总是只注意打针，好像除了打针，防疫工作就没有什么了。去年西北区发生口蹄疫的时候，苏联兽医专家班达林柯参加了这个工作。他了解了疫区的情况后，首先提出的建议就是发动群众，实行对疫区的封锁、消毒和隔离，并将主要的防疫知识传授给群众。通过群众的力量，迅速地扑灭了兽疫的蔓延。回来的时候，他郑重地告诉我们：“防疫队不是消防队，要等到那儿失了火才赶去救，火灭了事情就完了；而应该事先进行预防，使畜疫不发生。”
    在工作中间，苏联专家很注意和群众打成一片。去年河北黄骅县用飞机灭蝗时，六十岁的苏联专家卢森科和当地的干部群众生活在一起，每天天不亮踏着露水跑上一、二十里地去观察治虫的效果。阿·伊凡诺夫在东北黑龙江省克山县向农民讲马铃薯的栽培方法，一面说着一面就拿起农具到地里去动起手来。他们在介绍一种先进经验时，不独讲得清清楚楚，而且还动手做给你看，唯恐群众不懂。
    来我国的苏联专家，都以忘我的精神帮助我们工作。帮助我们训练拖拉机和康拜因机驾驶员的专家邱尔尼克夫，已经六十多岁了。今年夏天在小淀国营农场麦收时，每天都是从天亮到晚上，在酷热的气候下到处忙着，只要作业地里机具发生了故障，他就立即跑过去，亲自下手检查修复。小淀国营农场是为附近农民代耕的。一个接受代耕的农民田永康，已经七十多岁了，看到这个老年的苏联专家这样不辞劳苦地帮助他们工作，心里有说不出的感激，有一天他突然跑到邱尔尼克夫面前去，紧紧地抓着他的手，一个劲儿直喊：“斯大林万岁！”
    “苏联老大哥万岁！”
    兽医专家恩·伊瓦诺夫帮助我们开办讲习班，他连夜赶编讲义。因为他有不能久坐的腿病，有时熬到半夜，便只好勉强站起来，靠紧着棹子，一只手写字，一只手不断地揉擦着那有病的腿。作物育种专家阿·伊凡诺夫，在米丘林讲习班开课的前几天，因为过度工作把眼睛熬坏了，医生要他休息，可是他说：“讲课只用嘴，不要用眼睛。”他还是来上课。畜牧专家托罗易茨基去年冬天在察北讲课时，由于连续的露天工作的时间过长，突然发烧，我们找了汽车要送他回北京去休息，可是他说：“斯大林同志是要我们来工作的，不是来休息的。”他照常每夜还编写讲义，坚持到讲习班结束。
    伟大的苏联的朋友们和热爱他们自己的祖国一样热爱新中国。有一天，托罗易茨基住所的附近失火，他马上跑去帮邻居去救火。有一次，班达林柯参观一个畜牧场，那时正是羊只开始脱毛的春季，地头墙角到处都有羊毛失散着。他马上向我们提出：
    “这种不重视国家财产的态度是不应该的。”邱尔尼克夫有一次在国营农场的院子里发现扔掉的一块破旧的帆布，他立刻去找着农场的负责干部说：“这块东西留着以后补康拜因机上的帆布输送带多好。”
    苏联专家对我国农业充满了热情和信心。不久以前，阿·伊凡诺夫从各主要农业地区考察回京时，恳切地告诉我们：“中国的农业技术是具有着世界地位的，问题只是在于怎样去进行很好的总结。”卢森科在他工作期满归国之前发表的文章中说：新中国“由于中国农业上应用进步的米丘林科学的成功，更显明地看到它远大的前途。……载誉一时的美国农业科学，也要向中国农业学习进步的时期已为期不远了。”
    看到苏联专家的工作精神，使我们联想起解放以前美、英等帝国主义派来的所谓“农业专家”。他们有的坐着飞机去“调查”农村，实际上为帝国主义收集侵略我国的情报。有的则闭着眼睛贩卖资产阶级的一套“理论”“方法”，甚至实习的标本也是外国带来的。更可恶的，是他们撒布种种诬蔑、侮辱中国人民的说法，借以制造侵略阴谋。例如美国侵华组织之一的“中美农业技术合作团”发表的报告书里，就公然无耻地说：“在中国减少人口繁殖的任务，比土地改革或改善农民生活条件更为重要”。这种企图消灭中国人口的险恶的阴谋，今天已被中国人民彻底粉碎了。
