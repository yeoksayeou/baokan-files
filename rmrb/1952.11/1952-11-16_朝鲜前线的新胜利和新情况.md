    New Victories and New Situations on the Korean Front

    In October, the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army achieved another brilliant victory, eliminating more than 63,000 enemy troops, exceeding the total number of enemies eliminated in the half-year period from December of last year to May of this year. This victory once again demonstrates that the Chinese and Korean people's forces are becoming stronger and stronger, and they have learned the tactics of modern positional warfare.

    This victory is of great significance because it was achieved after the enemy announced an "indefinite adjournment" to sabotage the armistice negotiations, while the United Nations was meeting to debate the Korean issue, and the United States government was still insisting on the absurd claim of forcibly detaining prisoners of war, and attempting to force our side to yield with so-called "military pressure." It was at such a time that Van Fleet, starting on October 14th, launched what he called "the most violent offensive against the main Chinese defense line in a year" north of Kimhwa in the central Korean front at Shangganling, implementing their bankrupt so-called "military pressure" in an attempt to obtain things that could not be obtained at the negotiating table, to boost the morale of the servants, and to give Acheson, who was clamoring for the continuation of the Korean War at the United Nations General Assembly, a shot in the arm. For this arrogant purpose, the enemy was very determined. They dispatched more than 200 aircraft sorties in two days, fired 150,000 shells, and also used a large number of bombs weighing more than 1,000 pounds and napalm bombs, even at the cost of using more than six battalions of troops under the cover of more than a dozen aircraft and 70 tanks, to attack a small hill. However, as a result, the American aggressors suffered an unprecedented defeat.

    In the small battlefield near Shangganling, with only a few hilltops, the enemy suffered more than 18,000 casualties in 24 days of fighting. The significance of this battle cannot be underestimated. This number is 5,000 more than the total number of enemies eliminated in the first major victory of the Volunteers' entry into the war (the Battle of Yunshan), which was more than 13,000. It is more than double the average monthly total number of enemies eliminated from December of last year to May of this year. No wonder the enemy would exclaim: This is "the largest casualty in a single battle since the Korean War." "It is the second time in the 28-month Korean War that elite troops have suffered the most losses, second only to the losses suffered by the Eighth Army in North Korea in 1950."

    What does this illustrate? This shows that the Chinese and Korean people's forces are becoming stronger and stronger, and the era of the enemy's clamoring "technical superiority" has passed. According to the enemy's own confession: "The main reason for the difficulty of this battle is that the Chinese artillery played an amazing role." "On the Kimhwa battlefield, the intense concentration of Chinese artillery fire has begun to dominate the entire battle. ... Under this superior situation of the Chinese army, the Allied infantry could no longer hold Sniper Ridge. Its rocky and sandy slopes were blasted into dust by artillery shells, making it impossible for the troops to hide." This shows how powerful our artillery fire is! Not only that, but it also shows that due to the continuous improvement of our army's technical equipment, the increasing richness of our army's combat experience, our army has become a powerful army that is invincible in both mobile warfare and positional warfare.

    Why does our army have so many cannons and shells? Although there is enthusiastic support from the people of the motherland, it still needs to be continuously transported to the front. Hasn't the enemy repeatedly claimed that our railways and highways—supply lines—have been destroyed by their "air superiority"? This victory has once again punctured the enemy's bragging. In fact, the Volunteer Army troops on the Korean front can now not only get a full supply of weapons and ammunition, but also clothing, food, and cultural and recreational supplies are very adequate. The situation of arduous combat under the enemy's superior firepower a year ago has fundamentally changed.

    The strengthening of our army's equipment, the improvement of the supply situation, as well as the enrichment of combat experience, the improvement of tactical technology and command art, and the improvement of political work, have made our Volunteer Army a growing and invincible force, making our front line a very solid steel defense line, thereby stabilizing the situation in Korea. This is the new situation on the Korean front that can be seen from this battle. Now, in front of our army's defense line, no matter how much it costs, the enemy should not think about moving forward. A reporter from the Associated Press said: "How can the United Nations forces brave this rain of bullets and cross the barbed wire and trenches that the Communist army has prepared for more than a year to advance? The simple answer is: they can't." The enemy can not only fail to break through our army's defense line to boast of their so-called "military pressure," but it is being forced to pay increasingly heavy casualties in our army's counterattacks and blocking battles, and this is the fatal wound of the arrogant and domineering American aggressors.

    The victory in October, especially the Shangganling operation north of Kimhwa, once again clearly revealed the true situation of the current balance of power between the enemy and us in the Korean War. We believe that the ever-increasing military victories of the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army will surely finally shatter the American aggressors' conspiracy to indefinitely prolong and expand the Korean War, thereby creating conditions for the final realization of the Korean armistice and the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue on a fair and reasonable basis.

### 朝鲜前线的新胜利和新情况

    朝鲜前线的新胜利和新情况
    十月份，中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军又获得了辉煌的胜利，歼灭了敌人六万三千余人，超过去年十二月到今年五月半年中的歼敌总数。这一胜利，又一次地说明朝中人民部队已越战越强，它们已学会了现代化阵地作战的战术。
    这个胜利有重大的意义，因为它是在敌人宣布“无限期休会”来破坏停战谈判之后，在联合国正在开会辩论朝鲜问题、而美国政府仍在坚持强制扣留战俘的荒谬主张，并企图以所谓“军事压力”来迫使我方屈服的情况下取得的。就在这样的时候，范佛里特自十月十四日起在朝鲜前线中部金化以北上甘岭发动了这个他自称为一年来“向中国的主要防线所发动的一次最猛烈的进攻”，施行他们早已破产了的所谓“军事压力”，来企图取得谈判桌上所不能取得的东西，来振奋一下仆从们的情绪，并给在联合国大会上叫嚣着要继续进行朝鲜战争的艾奇逊打一支强心针，为着这一狂妄目的，敌人是下了很大决心的。他们曾经在两天中出动二百多架次飞机，发射十五万发炮弹，还大量使用了一千磅以上的炸弹和凝固汽油弹，甚至不惜使用六个营以上的兵力在十几架飞机和七十多辆坦克掩护下，去攻击一个小小的高地。但是，结果，美国侵略者却遭受了空前的失败。
    仅仅在上甘岭附近只有几个山头的小小的战场上，在二十四天的战斗中，敌人就死伤了一万八千多人，这一战役的意义不能不说是很重大的。这个数目比志愿军出国作战的第一次大捷（云山战役）消灭敌人总数（一万三千余人）还多五千人。比去年十二月到今年五月的每月平均歼敌总数多一倍。无怪敌人会要惊呼说：这是“朝鲜战争以来的一次单独战斗中的最大伤亡。”“是二十八个月的朝鲜战争中第二次损失精锐部队最多的战斗，这次损失仅次于一九五○年第八军在北朝鲜惨败时的损失。”
    这说明什么问题呢？这说明中朝人民部队愈战愈强了，敌人叫嚣的“技术优势”的时代已过去了。据敌人自供：“这次战斗的困难的主要原因，是因为中国的大炮发挥了惊人的作用。”“在金化地区战场上，中国军队大炮炮火的猛烈集中，已开始在整个战斗中占优势。……在中国军队这种优越的形势下，联军步兵已无法守住狙击兵岭。它的岩石和沙土的山坡被炮弹炸成灰土，使军队无从隐蔽。”这说明我军炮火的威力是何等的强大！不但如此，这还说明了由于我军技术装备的不断改善，由于我军作战经验的日益丰富，我军已经成为一支无论在运动战或在阵地战中都战无不胜的强大军队。
    我军为什么有那么多的大炮和炮弹呢？虽然有祖国人民的热烈支持，但也还要能源源不断地运到前方去才算数。敌人不是一再宣称我们的铁路、公路——供应线已经给他们的“空中优势”炸毁了么？这次的胜利，把敌人的牛皮又戳破了。其实，我们朝鲜前线的志愿军部队，现在已经不仅可以得到充分的武器弹药供应，而且服装、食物和文化娱乐用品的供给也是非常充分了。一年以前在敌人优势的火力下艰苦作战的情况已经根本改变了。
    我军装备的加强，供应状况的改善，以及战斗经验的丰富，战术技术和指挥艺术的提高，政治工作的提高，就使我志愿军锻炼成为一支日益强大的不可战胜的力量，使我们的战线成为一条十分巩固的钢铁的防线，从而稳定了朝鲜的战局。这就是从这次战斗中可以看到的朝鲜前线的新的情况。现在，在我军的防线前面，敌人不论花多少代价也不要想前进一步。合众社的记者说：“联合国军怎样才能冒着这种弹雨，冲过共军用一年多的时间准备起来的铁丝网与战壕向前进攻呢？干脆的回答是：他们办不到。”敌人不但不能攻破我军的防线来吹嘘他们的所谓“军事压力”，而且它正在我军的反击和阻击战中，被迫而付出越来越大的伤亡，而这就是狂妄骄横不可一世的美国侵略者的致命伤。
    十月份的胜利，特别是金化以北上甘岭的作战，又一次地清楚地揭露了在朝鲜作战的敌我双方现时力量对比的真实情况。我们相信，中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军所不断取得的越来越大的军事胜利，必能最后粉碎美国侵略者想要无限期地延长和扩大朝鲜战争的阴谋，从而创造条件，使在公平合理基础上的朝鲜停战和朝鲜问题的和平解决在最后能够实现。
