To our respected Chairman Mao: We are revolutionary disabled soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. We were gloriously wounded and became disabled in the struggle against enemies at home and abroad; however, we do not have the slightest pessimism, but have become even stronger. We hate war mongers even more, love our motherland, and cherish our victory. Since we cannot continue to fight on the front lines, we are determined to actively study culture and construction knowledge in order to support the Volunteer Army and build our great motherland.

    A quick literacy learning campaign has unfolded in our school. Comrades are participating in the study with unparalleled enthusiasm. Classrooms are being built, so we hold classes outdoors; without desks, we use long benches instead. Some comrades lost their fingers in the war, so they use both palms to hold the pen and learn to write. Comrade Liu Jianzhang, paralyzed in his lower limbs, lies in bed reading books and writing manuscripts all day long. Comrades overcame all kinds of difficulties, seizing every minute of time, and finally learned 1,600 to 2,000 characters in sixty hours. Recently, comrades have been intensively studying quick arithmetic. After only five days, Comrade Zhang Fuqing, who previously did not even recognize Arabic numerals, is now able to calculate additions and subtractions of five-digit numbers and multiplications of three-digit numbers. Soon, we will learn fraction arithmetic and complex fraction simplification.

    In our spare time, we also actively participate in labor. We have reclaimed wasteland around the school to grow vegetables, and have harvested more than 20,000 catties of various vegetables in the past year. When building the school buildings, most of the timber, bricks and tiles were brought by ourselves from places more than ten miles away. Comrade Yang Dayun, who lost both feet in the war, has difficulty moving around on weekdays, but he still enthusiastically participated in the transportation work, kneeling on the ground to transport bricks and tiles back and forth. With such selfless labor, comrades saved the country more than 96 million yuan in transportation costs. From January to March this year, we carried out a campaign to cherish public property and save on supplies, saving more than 60 million yuan in public expenses.

    Chairman Mao: We have difficulties in our study and work, but under your leadership and care, every comrade has carried forward the spirit of revolutionary heroism and overcome all difficulties. We are happy to assure you: we will continue to work hard to improve our political and cultural level and do more work for the people.

    川南革命残废军人学校全体同志
    决心克服一切困难为人民做更多工作
    敬爱的毛主席：我们是中国人民解放军和中国人民志愿军的革命残废军人。我们在和国内外敌人斗争时光荣地负了伤，成了残废；但我们没有丝毫悲观情绪，反而更加坚强起来了。我们愈发痛恨战争贩子，热爱我们的祖国，珍惜我们的胜利。我们不能继续上前线作战，就决心积极学习文化，学习建设知识，为支援志愿军和建设伟大祖国而努力。
    速成识字学习运动在我们学校里展开了。同志们都无比热情地参加了学习。教室正在修建，我们就在露天上课；没有书桌，我们就用长凳代替。有的同志在战争中失去了手指，就用两个手掌夹着笔学写字。下肢瘫痪的刘建章同志，躺在床上整天看书，写稿。同志们克服了种种困难，抓紧每一分钟时间，终于在六十小时中学会了一千六百字到两千字。最近同志们又突击学习速成算术。经过短短五天的时间，过去连阿剌伯数字都不识的张富清同志，现在已能演算五位数的加减法和三位数的乘法了。不久，我们即将学会分数四则和繁分化简法。
    在课余，我们还积极参加劳动。我们在学校四周开垦了荒地种植蔬菜，一年来收了各种蔬菜两万多斤。在修建校舍时，大部木料砖瓦都是我们亲手从来回十来里远的地方搬来的。在战争中失去双脚的杨大云同志，平日行动都感困难，但他仍热情地参加搬运工作，用膝盖跪在地上来回接运砖瓦。同志们就用这样忘我的劳动，给祖国节约了搬运费九千六百余万元。今年一月到三月，我们开展了爱护公物、节省用具的运动，节约了公用开支六千多万元。
    毛主席：我们在学习和工作中是有困难的，但在您的领导和关怀下，每个同志都发扬了革命英雄主义精神，克服了一切困难。我们愉快地向您保证：我们要继续努力，提高政治、文化水平，为人民做更多的工作。
    川南革命残废军人学校全体同志
