    “大众电影”第十一期介绍
    “大众电影”第十一期是“中苏友好月”苏联影片展览专辑。王阑西的“欢迎苏联影片展览月”和蔡楚生的“迎苏联电影工作者”，着重介绍了苏联电影对中国广大群众和电影工作者的教育和影响，并指出了这次苏联影片展览的重大意义。
    这一期“大众电影”对于这次上映的主要影片作了详细的评论和介绍。如贾霁的“‘难忘的一九一九年’的历史和现实意义”，梅朵的“跟上去，向伟大的理想前进！（我看“金星英雄”）”，岳野的“反映共产主义建设的影片‘顿巴斯矿工’”，都从思想上、艺术上对这些影片的成就进行了分析。发表工农群众看过影片后的观感成为这一期“大众电影”的特色，如“全国农业劳动模范看‘金星英雄’”一文，就是全国农业劳动模范们看这部影片后的感想；“矿工刘振州看‘顿巴斯矿工’”一文，是北京城子煤矿一位青年矿工看了这部电影后的谈话。这一期的“大众电影”对“乡村医生”“明朗的夏天”，苏维埃乌兹别克斯坦”“苏联大马戏团”“苏联五彩动画集锦”等影片也作了介绍。
