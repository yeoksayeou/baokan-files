Seeing the Superiority of Soviet Technical Experience from a Motor Installation Project
Zhong Ran

In the past, when a motor installation project was underway, before you even approached the construction site, you would constantly hear the clanging of rivets being hammered. However, at the installation site of the Northeast Fuxin Power Plant, besides seeing the sparks flying, you wouldn't hear that sound. This is because the Northeast Fuxin Power Plant installation project adopted advanced Soviet technical experience, using almost no rivets, with most joints being welded. A total of twenty-seven tons of various welding rods were used. The biggest advantages of using welding are that it is strong, fast, economical, and can reduce future maintenance work.

The huge turbine generators and boiler equipment installed at the Northeast Fuxin Power Plant were designed by Soviet experts, and the entire project was carried out under the direct guidance of the Soviet expert team. The advanced Soviet installation experience has achieved remarkable results here and has greatly educated our workers and technicians.

This installation project adopted a special construction method called "combined installation method." For example, the boiler's cold water wall and steel frame were first assembled on the ground and then erected. The greatest advantage of this installation method is that it not only ensures the quality of the project and speeds up the progress, but more importantly, it avoids the dangers of high-altitude operations. However, in the beginning, our workers and technicians were not accustomed to this construction method. Some said, "I have installed cold water walls several times, and I have never seen them assembled on the ground first. It's so cumbersome!" Others also said, "I haven't seen this kind of operation method in books. The Soviet operation method is really special!" Indeed, this advanced operation method cannot be found in old books, as it is a Soviet creation. Soviet experts used writing as an analogy, saying, "If you hang the paper in the air to write, it will be both difficult and poorly written; if you spread the paper on a desk to write, you can write quickly and well." Combined installation is the same principle. Capitalist countries have not done this because their technology is not only behind the Soviet Union, but they also do not treat workers as human beings at all, and do not consider whether workers are safe or not.

Looking at the concrete foundation pouring project, in the past we used segmental pouring, and we had to wait for this section to solidify before pouring the next section, which took a long time. Now, Soviet experts have proposed replacing the segmental pouring method with a continuous pouring method, which not only eliminates joints in the entire concrete foundation, but also shortens the formal pouring period from fifteen days to three days. Before pouring, Soviet experts helped us prepare the necessary machinery and equipment, and made configuration plans. Soviet experts also personally explained the operating procedures and key issues in the construction to the workers twice and conducted on-site exercises, so the project quality exceeded the predetermined standards.

The conscientious and responsible spirit of the Soviet experts deeply moved our workers and technicians. For example, everyone did not pay much attention to the finishing work of various projects, but Soviet experts valued it very much and checked it very carefully. If a water pump is missing a screw after everything is installed; if the distribution panel and cables are placed, but the label is not written or not arranged neatly; if there is a little bit of dirt in various parts of the turbine, it cannot be considered complete. Soviet experts often estimated the percentage of completion of each task to be less than our estimates. At that time, some comrades did not quite agree; later, in order to complete these finishing tasks, it took a lot of effort to realize that the percentage of completion estimated by the Soviet experts was very accurate.

The Fuxin Power Plant installation project is very large, with a total earthwork volume of more than 13,000 cubic meters. In addition to the plant building, it also requires 2,000 tons of cement and more than 700 tons of steel. This huge installation project was successfully completed in less than a year under the guidance of advanced Soviet experience and Soviet experts, one and a half months ahead of schedule. The project cost was saved by 18%, and the quality all met the predetermined standards, and some even exceeded the specifications. For example, the allowable tolerance of the boiler steam drum level is 1 mm, and the actual tolerance reached 0.5 mm; the allowable tolerance of the boiler auxiliary equipment No. 2 pulverized coal machine level is 0.2 mm, and the actual tolerance is 0.1 mm. The entire project truly achieved "good, fast, and economical." These achievements are inseparable from the concrete help of the Soviet elder brother. This fully demonstrates the superiority of advanced Soviet technical experience.

    从一个电机安装工程看苏联技术经验的优越性
    锺然
    过去一个电机安装工程在进行时，大家还未走近工地，就一定不断地听到叮叮当当打铆钉的声音，可是在东北阜新发电厂安装工程工地上，除看见火花闪灼飞舞以外，却听不到这种声音。原来东北阜新发电厂安装工程是采用的苏联先进技术经验，几乎不用铆钉，绝大部分接头的地方都是用的电焊。各种电焊条总共用了二十七吨。用电焊的最大优点是牢固、迅速、节省，并且可以减少以后的检修工作。
    东北阜新发电厂安装工程所安装的巨大透平发电机和锅炉设备，是苏联专家设计的，整个工程也是在苏联专家组直接指导下进行的。苏联先进的安装经验在这里取得卓越的成效，并给我们工人和技术人员很大的教育。
    这次安装工程采用了一种特殊的施工方法，叫做
    “组合安装法”。例如锅炉的冷水壁和钢架，就是先在地面上组合起来，然后竖起。这种安装法的最大优点是：不但能保证工程质量和加快工程的进度，而且更重要的是可以避免高空作业的危险。可是开始时，我们工人和技术人员对这种施工方法很不习惯，有的说：“我也安装过几次冷水壁，从来没见过先在地面上组合起来的，这多笨重呀！”有的还说：“我在书上就没见过这种作业方法，苏联的作业法真是特别！”不错，这种先进作业法在旧的书本上的确是找不到的，这原是苏联的创造。苏联专家拿写字来比喻说：“如果把纸临空悬挂起来写，既费劲又写不好；如果把纸摊在写字台上写，那就可以写得又快又好了。”组合安装就是这个道理。资本主义国家没有这样做过，因为它们不但技术比苏联落后，而且它们根本没把工人当人看待，根本不考虑工人安全不安全。
    再从混凝土基础的灌制工程来看，过去我们都是用分段灌制法，必须等这一段凝固了才能再灌另一段，需要时间很长。现在，苏联专家提出以连续灌制法来代替分段灌制法，不但使整个混凝土基础没有一个接头，而且把正式灌制工期由十五天缩短到三天。在灌制之前，苏联专家帮助我们准备了必需的机械、器具，并做出配置计划。苏联专家还亲自两次给工人讲解操作规程和施工中的关键问题，并进行了实地演习，因此工程质量超过了预定标准。
    苏联专家的认真负责精神使我国工人和技术人员深受感动。例如各项工程的结尾工作，大家都不大注意，但是苏联专家却看得很重，检查得很细。一台水泵一切都安装好了，若还差一个螺丝钉；配电盘和电缆都放好了，若没写标字牌或没有排列整齐；透平机各部有一点地方没弄干净；都不能算完工。苏联专家估计每项工作完成的百分数常小于我们的估计，当时有些同志还不很同意；到后来为了完成这些结尾工作确实费了不小的劲，才知道苏联专家所估计的完成百分数十分正确。
    阜新发电厂安装工程是很浩大的，除土量合一万三千多立方公尺，厂房建筑除外，还要用水泥二千吨、钢铁七百多吨。这一巨大的安装工程在苏联先进经验和苏联专家的指导下，不足一年时间就顺利完成了，比计划提前了一个半月。工程成本费用节省了百分之十八，而且质量都合乎预定标准，有的还超过了规格。如锅炉汽包水平允许公差是一公厘，实际公差达到○点五公厘；锅炉附属设备二号粉煤机水平允许公差是○点二公厘，实际公差是○点一公厘。整个工程真正做到了“又好，又快，又省”。这些成绩是与苏联老大哥的具体帮助分不开的。这就充分说明了苏联先进技术经验的优越性。
