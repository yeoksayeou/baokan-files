    "Three-Purpose Drilling Machine" Can Increase Work Efficiency More Than Tenfold
    Editor: Li Yabin, a fitter at a certain iron factory of the Logistics Department of the Central South Military Region, with the help of all the workers in the factory, successfully created a "three-purpose drilling machine" in September of this year. The "three-purpose drilling machine" has three functions:
    "Drilling," "Threading," and "Capping." It is powered by electricity and also has a foot-operated automatic switch. Experiments have proven that the products made by the "three-purpose drilling machine" are exquisite and bright, and the output is eleven to fourteen times higher than that of ordinary drilling machines. For example, in the past, each person could produce a maximum of one hundred (one and a half inch) "threaded screws" per day (eight hours of work), but now each person can produce more than one thousand two hundred.

    用“三用钻床”可提高工作效率十余倍
    编辑同志：中南军区后勤部某铁工厂钳工李迓斌，在全厂工友们的帮助下，于今年九月间创制
    “三用钻床”成功。“三用钻床”有三种功用，即：
    “钻孔”、“套丝”、“扣帽”。它是利用电力带动的，并且还装有脚踏自动开关。经实验证明，
    “三用钻床”制出的成品精致光亮，产量较一般钻床提高十一倍到十四倍以上。如过去每人每天（工作八小时）最多生产一百条（一寸半的）“套螺丝”，现在每人可生产一千二百多条。
