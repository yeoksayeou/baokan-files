Xinhua News Agency, November 19th: The All-China Sports Federation issued the following statement regarding the British government's refusal to issue entry visas to the Chinese table tennis team to Singapore:

The All-China Sports Federation, upon the gracious invitation of the Asian Table Tennis Association, formally joined the Asian Table Tennis Association as a member on October 12th of this year, as the only national sports organization that can represent China. We also received a letter from the Singapore Table Tennis Association on October 18th, welcoming our Federation to send players to participate in the first Asian Table Tennis Championships, organized by the Association, to be held in Singapore from November 22nd to 29th this year. Our Federation organized the Chinese Table Tennis Team and completed the registration procedures on November 6th, and designated representatives from the team to attend the first conference of the Asian Table Tennis Association to be held in Singapore. However, the British government, without any reason, refused to issue entry visas to the Chinese Table Tennis Team to Singapore on November 10th.

The purpose of the first Asian Table Tennis Championships is to allow table tennis players from Asian countries to observe skills, enhance friendship, and develop Asian sports and promote friendship between Asian athletes and Asian people. However, the British government's obstruction of the Chinese Table Tennis Team from going to Singapore is an unreasonable act, rarely seen in the international community, deliberately undermining international sports competitions. The All-China Sports Federation cannot but express its protest against this. We firmly believe that although the Chinese Table Tennis Team is prevented from participating in the first Asian Table Tennis Championships held in Singapore, the friendship between Chinese athletes and athletes from Asian countries will be further enhanced, and it will not be obstructed or undermined by any means.

                                      All-China Sports Federation

    中华全国体育总会发表声明
    抗议英政府阻挠我乒乓球代表队赴新加坡
    【新华社十九日讯】中华全国体育总会关于英国政府拒发中国乒乓球代表队赴新加坡入境签证发表声明如下：
    中华全国体育总会应亚洲乒乓球协会的盛意邀请，于本年十月十二日以唯一能代表中国的全国性体育运动组织的资格，正式加入亚洲乒乓球协会为会员，并收到新加坡乒乓球协会十月十八日来函，欢迎我会派选手参加由该协会负责筹备的本年十一月二十二日至二十九日在新加坡举行的第一届亚洲乒乓球锦标赛。我会组织了中国乒乓球代表队在十一月六日完成报名手续，并由代表队中指定代表，出席在新加坡召开的亚洲乒乓球协会第一届会议。但英国政府竟在十一月十日毫无理由地拒发中国乒乓球代表队赴新加坡的入境签证。
    第一届亚洲乒乓球锦标赛的目的，是为了亚洲各国乒乓球选手观摩球艺，增进友谊，以开展亚洲体育运动和促进亚洲运动员和亚洲人民间的友谊。但英国政府竟阻挠中国乒乓球代表队赴新加坡，这种有意破坏国际运动比赛的举动，实属国际上鲜见的无理行为。中华全国体育总会对此不能不表示抗议。我们深信，虽然中国乒乓球代表队被阻不能参加在新加坡举行的第一届亚洲乒乓球锦标赛，但中国运动员与亚洲各国运动员间的友谊，必将更加增进，断非任何手段所能阻挠和破坏。
                                      中华全国体育总会
                                  一九五二年十一月十九日
