    Learning from the Soviet Union's Valuable Experience in Accepting National Artistic Heritage
    Cheng Yanqiu
    The visit of the Soviet Cultural and Artistic Delegation to China has deepened our understanding of the great friendship of the Soviet people towards us. The various excellent performances have not only allowed us to truly understand the art that concretely reflects the lives of the Soviet people, but also provided us with rich and advanced experiences in literary and artistic work. It has enlightened us to more clearly define the direction of serving the people. We believe that this performance by Soviet artists in China will not only help us avoid many detours in the question of how to inherit the excellent artistic traditions of our motherland and develop the people's literary and artistic work, but will also allow us to quickly and smoothly advance victoriously and achieve greater success.
    Among the various performance programs, one of the programs that touched me the most was the singing of Comrade Hanon, a People's Artist of the Uzbek Republic and a Stalin Prize winner, as well as the folk songs sung by Comrade Naserova, a People's Artist of the Soviet Union and a Stalin Prize winner. The year before last, I visited the arts of various fraternal nationalities in the Northwest and had a preliminary understanding of the arts of the Kazakh and Uzbek nationalities within China. Comparing what I heard then with what I hear today, it is very clear that Soviet people's artists have adopted a very serious attitude towards accepting national artistic heritage and have achieved great success. In the Northwest, the songs of the Kazakh and Uzbek nationalities that we heard were relatively primitive; what we hear today has been processed, refined and developed, and there is a great difference in technology compared to the former; however, in its basic style, it still strongly maintains the unique characteristics of its own nation.
    Based on this valuable experience of Soviet artists, we deeply feel that our literary and artistic work in the future should also strive in this direction, especially in the improvement of opera. Chairman Mao instructed us to
    "Let a hundred flowers bloom." We must be extra careful to cherish every artistic tree and every artistic bud. However, what is true cherishing? We cannot say that simply protecting it is fulfilling our responsibility. We must know how to cultivate it, prune it, so that this tree grows more luxuriantly and the flowers are more abundant.
    During the first National Opera Observation Conference, the performances of Soviet literary and art workers are of even greater significance for our artistic work. Many problems that are difficult for us to solve at the moment have already been correctly solved by Soviet art workers with successful facts. We should thank these good teachers and helpful friends! We should encourage each other to do our work well, and repay the deep affection of Soviet artists with our new artistic achievements. I think this is also the gift they are most happy to receive.

    学习苏联接受民族艺术遗产的宝贵经验
    程砚秋
    这次苏联文化艺术工作团来中国，使我们更深一层感觉到苏联人民对我们的伟大友爱。各种精采的演出，不仅使我们切实领会到具体的反映苏联人民生活的艺术，尤其给予了我们文艺工作以丰富的先进经验。它启示了我们更明确地为人民服务的方向。我们相信，苏联艺术家这一次来中国表演，使我们在如何继承祖国优良艺术传统和发展人民文艺工作的问题上，不但避免了走许多弯曲道路，而且会很快很顺利地胜利前进获得更大的成就。
    在各种表演节目中，使我感受最深的节目之一，是乌兹别克共和国人民演员、斯大林奖金获得者哈侬同志的歌唱，还有苏联人民演员、斯大林奖金获得者纳赛罗娃同志所演唱的民族歌曲。前年我访问过西北各兄弟民族的艺术，对于在中国境内的哈萨克民族和乌兹别克民族的艺术，曾经有过初步的了解；以之和今日所听到的来比较，很显明的看出苏联人民艺术家在接受民族艺术遗产上是抱着极严肃的态度，并已获得了伟大的成就。在西北，我们所听到哈萨克和乌兹别克两民族的歌曲，是比较原始的；今天所听到的是经过加工提练而发展了的，较之前者在技术上已有很大的不同了；可是在基本风格上，它却依然强烈地保持着其本民族独具的特色。
    根据苏联艺术家的这一宝贵经验，使我们深深感觉到今后我们的文艺工作，也应该循着这方向而努力，特别是在戏曲改进问题上。毛主席指示我们要
    “百花齐放”。我们要倍加小心地爱护每一株艺术树本，每一个艺术蓓蕾。可是，怎样才是真正的爱护呢？我们不能说只是单纯的保护就算尽到了责任，必需知道如何去培养，去修理，使这株树生长得更茂盛，花朵更繁茂。
    正在第一届全国戏曲观摩大会期间，苏联文艺工作者的演出，对于我们艺术工作的帮助是更具有重大意义的。我们有好多一时难于解决的问题，苏联艺术工作者已经用成功的事实来替我们正确地解决了。我们应该感谢我们的这些良师益友！我们应该互相鼓励，做好我们的工作，以我们新的艺术上的成就，来答谢苏联艺术家的深情。我想这也是他们最乐于接受的礼物。
