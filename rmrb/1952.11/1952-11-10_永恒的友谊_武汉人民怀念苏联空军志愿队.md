The people of Wuhan will never forget the heroes of the Soviet Air Force Volunteer Group who came to China to help us resist the Japanese invaders and sacrificed their lives in those years of profound suffering for our country.

In 1938, the second year of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Chinese people were bravely fighting for national survival under difficult conditions. At this time, the Soviet people sent the Soviet Air Force Volunteer Group from faraway Moscow. The heroes, carrying forward the great internationalist spirit of the Party of Lenin and Stalin, piloted batches of new eagles – "Katyusha" and "Dasha" – to Wuhan. In less than a year after arriving in Wuhan, the Soviet Air Force Volunteer Group successively carried out a series of fierce air battles, including expeditions to Taipei, fierce attacks on enemy warships on the Yangtze River, and three defenses of Wuhan, destroying hundreds of enemy planes and warships. The Japanese invaders' once arrogant "air warriors," "Four Heavenly Kings," and Kisarazu and Sasebo air groups were also successively dealt devastating blows. Many heroes of the Volunteer Group shed their precious blood for the Chinese people in these glorious victorious air battles over Wuhan and the Yangtze River. More than a decade has passed, and the Chinese people have stood up, but the memory of the heroes will never be erased from the minds of the Chinese people, especially the people of Wuhan. The Tomb of the Soviet Air Force Martyrs in the International Cemetery on Zhongshan Avenue in Wuhan is a place where the people of Wuhan pay tribute to their respected heroes every year.

Old Wuhan residents clearly remember that on April 29, 1938, fifty-four enemy planes invaded Wuhan, and the Soviet Air Force Volunteer Group met them in the air, shooting down twenty-one enemy planes in one fell swoop. Many people who participated in the anti-Japanese national salvation work at that time, as well as doctors and nurses who participated in the anti-poison rescue team, witnessed this air battle. They told me that during the most intense moments of the battle, the eagles of the Soviet Air Force Volunteer Group often fought enemy planes two-on-one; sometimes when their own planes were damaged or on fire and were about to land, they did not hesitate to sacrifice their lives and ram into enemy planes. Since that time, after dealing a fatal blow to the enemy planes, the enemy planes did not dare to invade the skies over Wuhan for a whole month. Zhang Kai, director of the Hubei Provincial People's Medical Bureau, could not help but shed tears of gratitude when recalling those days. This sixty-four-year-old doctor warmly and sincerely reminisced about the Soviet Air Force Volunteer Group, saying: I knew from that air battle to defend Greater Wuhan and the facts I witnessed afterwards that only the Soviet people truly helped us resist the war with their blood and flesh, and the Soviet people's high spirit of internationalism illuminated my eyes.

Stories of the Soviet Air Force Volunteer Group's heroic fighting and love for the Chinese people are widely circulated among the people of Wuhan. Living in a peaceful and happy life, they particularly cherish the memory of the Soviet Air Force Volunteer Group and regard the Soviet Air Force martyrs who sacrificed in China as their own relatives. During my most recent visit to the martyrs' tomb, I deeply felt the expression of this sincere friendship. Sleeping in the martyrs' tomb in the International Cemetery are seven martyrs, including Giselev, Balamonov, Gijelo Heden, Kozlov, Bishotersky, Vasin, and Kashelov, as well as eight unknown heroes, who sacrificed their lives in February to August 1938 to defend Wuhan. The caretaker of the martyrs' tomb is an old man in his fifties. While accompanying me to pay tribute, he told me how he gratefully and painfully buried the remains of the heroes in those war-torn nights in the early days of the war of resistance, and how he added new soil to these tombs every year since then. After liberation, people came here to pay tribute and mourn in an endless stream.

People are inspired and empowered by recalling the deeds of the martyrs. On September 3rd this year, the sixth anniversary of the victory of the great War of Resistance Against Japan, the heads of Wuhan's governments at all levels, labor models, and representatives from all walks of life came to the Tomb of the Soviet Air Force Volunteer Group Martyrs with reverence and gratitude. They presented wreaths of pure white fragrant flowers and expressed their determination in front of the tomb to smash the aggressive conspiracy of the US imperialism to separately conclude peace with Japan. In order to permanently commemorate this traditional friendship of life and death between the peoples of China and the Soviet Union and to enable the younger generation to learn from the internationalist spirit of the Soviet people, the people of Wuhan specially rebuilt a simple mausoleum with stone pillars and railings on the martyrs' tomb, erected a monument in front of the tomb, and installed a sickle, hammer, and five-pointed giant star symbolizing light and victory in the white gravel in the top of the tomb. When I recently visited the martyrs' tomb, the tomb was cleaned spotlessly, the green grass and impatiens flowers around the tomb were growing well, and the warm sunshine at noon shone on the tomb from the woods. Everything seemed to be silently comforting the martyrs: Rest in peace! Dear heroes, the Chinese land you once watered with your blood will always be a land of peace and tranquility.

### 永恒的友谊——武汉人民怀念苏联空军志愿队

    永恒的友谊
    ——武汉人民怀念苏联空军志愿队
    新华社记者  姚昌淦
    武汉人民永远也不会忘记：在我国苦难深重的年代里，来华援助我们抗击日寇侵略而牺牲的苏联空军志愿队的英雄们。
    一九三八年，抗日战争的第二个年头，中国人民正艰苦地为民族自存英勇奋战。这个时候，苏联人民从辽远的莫斯科派来了苏联空军志愿队。英雄们发扬伟大的列宁、斯大林党的国际主义精神，驾驶着一批一批新型的雄鹰——“卡秋莎”、“达莎”来到了武汉。在来到武汉不到一年的时间里，苏联空军志愿队先后进行了远征台北、猛击长江敌舰以及三次保卫武汉等一连串的激烈空战，击毁了数以百计的敌机敌舰；日寇一度视为不可一世的“空中武士”、“四大天王”和木更津、佐世保等航空队，也相继受到歼灭性的打击。志愿队的许多英雄们在这些光辉胜利的空战中，在武汉和扬子江的上空为中国人民洒下了宝贵的鲜血。十几年过去了，中国人民已经站起来了，但中国人民，特别是武汉人民对于英雄们的记忆是永世也不会磨灭的。武汉市中山大道万国公墓的苏联空军烈士墓，是武汉人民年年凭吊他们敬爱的英雄的地方。
    上了年纪的老武汉人都清楚地记得在一九三八年四月二十九日那天，五十四架敌机进袭武汉，苏联空军志愿队凌空迎战，一举击落了敌机二十一架。许多在当时曾参加抗日救亡工作的人和参加防毒救护团工作的医师和护士们，都是这次空战的目击者。他们告诉我：在战斗最激烈的时候，苏联空军志愿队的雄鹰往往是以一对二抗击敌机；有时候自己的飞机受伤或着火，眼看就要降落了，但他们不惜牺牲自己的生命和敌机拚撞。自从那次给敌机以致命打击之后，整整一个月以内，敌机没有敢侵袭武汉上空。湖北省人民医药局主任张楷在回忆那些日子的时候，还忍不住掉下感激的眼泪。这位六十四岁的老医生热情而淳朴地缅怀着苏联空军志愿队，他说：我从那次保卫大武汉的空战和以后亲眼看见的事实中知道，只有苏联人民才真正是用血肉帮助我们抗战，苏联人民高度的国际主义的精神照亮了我的眼睛。
    武汉人民中间广泛地流传着苏联空军志愿队英勇战斗和热爱中国人民的故事。他们生活在和平幸福的生活中分外怀念苏联空军志愿队，把牺牲在中国的苏联空军烈士们当作自己的亲人。我在最近一次凭吊烈士墓的时候，深深感到人们这种真挚情谊的流露。长眠在万国公墓的烈士墓里的有吉谢辽夫、巴拉莫诺夫、吉皆洛赫登、考兹洛夫、比捎特斯基、瓦新、卡谢洛夫七位烈士和八位无名英雄，他们是在一九三八年二月到八月为保卫武汉而牺牲的。看管烈士墓的是一位年过半百的老人，他一面陪我凭吊一面告诉我在抗战初期战火纷飞的那些深夜里，他怎样感激和沉痛地亲手埋葬英雄的遗骸，以后每年怎样为这些坟墓加培新土，解放后到这儿来祭奠和凭吊的人络续不绝。
    人们从缅怀烈士的事迹中，得到鼓舞和力量。今年九月三日，伟大的抗日战争胜利六周年纪念日，武汉市的各级政府首长、劳动模范和各界人民代表怀着敬仰和感谢来到苏联空军志愿队烈士墓，他们献上净素芳香的花圈，并且在墓前表示了粉碎美帝国主义单独对日媾和的侵略阴谋的决心。为了永久纪念中苏两国人民之间这种生死相关的传统友谊，使年轻一代学习苏联人民的国际主义精神，武汉市人民特地在烈士墓上重新建筑了石柱栏杆的朴素陵园，并且在墓前树立了碑石，在墓顶洁白的碎石中间安上了象征着光明和胜利的镰刀、铁锤和五角巨星。当我最近凭吊烈士墓的时候，墓地打扫得干干净净，墓四周的青草和凤仙花长得正好，中午暖和的阳光从树林里照射在墓上。一切景物都似乎默默地向烈士们告慰：安息吧！亲爱的英雄，你们曾经用鲜血浇灌过的中国土地，将永远是一片和平和宁静的土地。
