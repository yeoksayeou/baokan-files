　　The "Beggar's Courtyard" of Nanhecao Has Changed Its Appearance
　　To the Editor: The No. 23 Courtyard of Nanhecao, Beijing, used to be famous for being "dirty, poor, and dilapidated." The residents in this courtyard were so poor that they couldn't afford to eat. The courtyard was so dirty that it was impossible to enter. People called this courtyard the "Beggar's Courtyard." After liberation for several years, society has changed, and so has this courtyard.
　　There are more than twenty households and eighty people living in this courtyard, mostly working people. In those years under Japanese and Kuomintang reactionary rule, everyone lived a life of tears and sorrow. They pedaled tricycles, worked as laborers, reeled thread, and picked coal cinders. The money they earned wasn't even enough to eat "mixed flour." Some families even had to dig for wild vegetables in the fields of Yuqingguan. As for the "hygiene" situation in the courtyard, at that time, there was a large pit in the middle of the courtyard. Every household dumped dirty water, dirty soil, and children's excrement into the pit. In winter, the courtyard became a small ice mountain; in summer, the courtyard reeked, and the pit was full of maggots, with flies and mosquitoes buzzing all day long. People in this courtyard were plagued by all kinds of infectious diseases year-round. Every summer, adults and children had diarrhea, so much so that they couldn't stand up straight. When typhoid fever broke out, it affected family after family, spreading from one to another. In spring and autumn, many people suffered from blepharitis and impetigo, and some children were covered in sores, unable to sleep.
　　Since the liberation of Beijing more than three years ago, this courtyard has changed under the leadership of the People's Government. In the first year after liberation, Aunt Zhang in the courtyard led everyone to find large carts and fill in the large pit in the courtyard. Of course, this was not an easy task. In the beginning, when she promoted hygiene to everyone, they ignored her. When she mobilized everyone to clean up, they were unwilling to do it. When she called for vaccinations against infectious diseases, they didn't go either. It was even more difficult to ask everyone to sweep the courtyard every day. Some people said, "We're only allowed to move the soil once a year, but we've never heard of sweeping every day."
　　Under the leadership and patient advocacy of Aunt Zhang and other activists, especially after the launch of the patriotic hygiene campaign this year, everyone in the courtyard became active. The whole courtyard established a patriotic hygiene pact, and everyone gradually developed the habit of cleaning and loving cleanliness. The courtyard is swept three or two times a day, and the streets at the entrance are also kept clean. Seventy-six-year-old Old Lady Fu rushes to sweep the courtyard every day, swatting flies everywhere with a fly swatter in her hand. The dirty courtyard has changed its appearance, just as Aunt Zhang said, "Now you can't even see flies when you eat in the courtyard, and there are not many people getting sick."
　　The reason why the people in the courtyard are able to pay attention to hygiene and love cleanliness is fundamentally because their lives have improved. Aunt Zhang's family now has two sons working, earning eight or nine bags of flour a month, with no worries about food or clothing. Li Chenglong's family of four used to pull two-wheeled carts, and the family, young and old, picked coal cinders, but it was still not enough to eat. In winter, the whole family rolled on straw mats, without quilts to cover them. After liberation, he was transferred to another job, and his son also found work. The father and son earn more than 20,000 yuan a day, and the whole family has made new clothes. Recently, they also made two new quilts. The same is true for other families. If you go to this courtyard at night, you can see every household making pancakes, noodles, or eating steamed buns. Nine young people in the courtyard are now studying culture in the district's adult night school. Every Saturday, they read the newspaper to everyone in the courtyard. The people in the courtyard all say, "Chairman Mao is leading us, and our courtyard is getting stronger year by year. Whatever Chairman Mao wants us to do, we will do it, and our lives will get better and better." Liu Shi

　　"We Have Overcome Dirt and Disease"
　　To the Editor: Ganxi Village in Genglou Township is a village in Shouchang County, Zhejiang Province, where patriotic hygiene work is done relatively well. This village has ninety-five peasant households, raising more than twenty cattle and more than a thousand chickens and ducks, but you can't see any cow dung, chicken droppings, or firewood garbage in the village. The toilets in front and behind the houses are also cleaned very cleanly. Some pit seats have wooden lids added, and some pits are covered with straw curtains or bamboo mats. Since July, the village has carried out more than ten major cleanups, with every household cleaning and everyone participating. The flower lattice windows in the home of military dependent Fang Shoulan had not been washed for more than fifty years and were so dirty that they were unrecognizable. During this patriotic hygiene campaign, their family washed each pane of the windows clean, giving this old house a new look. Now, in any farmer's home, the quilts, tents, daily furniture, and even the door and window panels are all scrubbed clean, which makes people feel refreshed. All the villagers pay attention to personal hygiene, changing clothes frequently and taking more baths. The hands, faces, and clothes of the children are no longer dirty. More attention is paid to diet. No one eats any more stale, rotten food or drinks raw water. Drinking water and water for other uses are strictly separated, using pond water and drinking well water, and the wells are covered. Flies, mosquitoes, fleas... have been greatly reduced after mass extermination. You can sleep soundly at night without a mosquito net even in hot weather. In short, paying attention to hygiene and loving cleanliness has become a new trend among the masses in the whole village.
　　The achievements of the patriotic hygiene campaign in Ganxi Village are inseparable from the efforts of propagandist Huang Xiaoxiang. Huang Xiaoxiang is the director of the Women's Federation in Genglou Township. After listening to the report on the bacteriological warfare waged by American imperialism and the call to launch the patriotic hygiene campaign, she returned to the village and widely publicized it among the masses, and influenced everyone with practical actions. She first cleaned her own home inside and out, literally giving the whole house a bath, and it was really comfortable to live in. The neighbors on the left and right were very envious when they saw it, and they couldn't help but follow suit. She then organized the ten women in her group to take action, and then held a women's meeting to challenge the whole village. As a result, the patriotic hygiene campaign was launched in the village in full swing.
　　"How can we keep every household clean all the time?" Huang Xiaoxiang and the village cadres discussed and decided to establish an inspection system to carry out criticism and praise. Therefore, the village set up an inspection team, and each group selected an inspector. The inspectors supervise and urge at any time; the inspection team conducts a general survey and comparison within a certain period of time, praising the good and criticizing the bad. In this way, the hygiene campaign in Ganxi Village has turned to become regularized, and it has also driven other villages in Genglou Township.
　　Due to the development of the hygiene campaign, no one in the village had diarrhea or malaria this summer and autumn. Huang Xiaoxiang immediately seized on this vivid fact and publicized it to the masses, making the hygiene campaign more consolidated and in-depth.
　　Now the people in the village often happily talk about: "Chairman Mao not only led us to overthrow feudalism and divide the land, but also led us to overcome dirt and disease, and live a happy and clean life."

### 注意卫生已逐渐成为群众自觉的习惯

    注意卫生已逐渐成为群众自觉的习惯
    南河漕“花子院”变了样
    编辑同志：北京市南河漕二十三号大院，过去是以“脏、穷、破”出名的。这个大院里的住户家家户户穷得吃不上饭，院子脏得没法进去，人们都把这个院子叫作“花子院”。解放几年来社会变了，这个院子也变了。
    这个院子里住有二十多户，八十多口人，大部是劳动人民。在日本和国民党反动统治那年月，大家过的是眼泪泡着心的日子，蹬三轮，做小工，打线，捡煤核，挣来的钱还不够吃“混合面”，有些人家还得到玉清观野地挖野菜吃。再说院子里的“卫生”情况吧，在那时候，院子中间是个大坑，家家户户的脏水、脏土、孩子屎都往大坑里倒。冬天，院子成了个小冰山；夏天，院里臭气薰人，大坑里满生着蛆，苍蝇蚊子整天嗡嗡叫。一年到头各种传染病缠着这院里的人们。年年夏天大人、孩子都拉稀，拉得人直不起腰来。闹起伤寒来就是一家子一家子的，你传我，我传你。到了春秋两季，很多人烂眼边，长薄皮疮，有些孩子混身上下都长满了，觉都不能睡。
    北京解放三年多以来，在人民政府领导下，这个大院改变了。解放头一年，院里的张大妈带动大家伙找了大车，把院里的大坑垫平了。当然，这不是一件容易事，一开始，她向大家宣传注意卫生的时候——不理这个碴；动员大家扫除——不愿干；叫打传染病预防针——也不去。要叫大家天天打扫院子，那就更困难了。有的人说：“一年只许动一次土，可没听说过每天打扫的。”
    在张大妈等积极分子带动和耐心宣传下，特别是今年爱国卫生运动开展后，院里的人都积极起来了。全院订立了爱国卫生公约，大家慢慢地养成了勤打扫、爱清洁的习惯。院子里天天要扫三遍两遍的，门口的街道上也经常保持得干干净净。七十六岁的傅老太太，天天抢着扫院子，手里拿个蝇拍子到处打苍蝇。脏大院变了样，正像张大妈说：“现在在院里吃饭都看不见苍蝇，闹病的人也没有几个了。”
    院里的人们所以能够讲究卫生、喜爱清洁，基本原因是他们的生活都改善了。张大妈家现在两个儿子都在做工，每月挣八、九袋面，吃不愁，穿不愁。李成龙家四口人，过去他拉两轮车，家里大小捡煤核，还是不够吃，冬天全家滚炕席，没有被子盖。解放后他转业了，儿子也有了工作，爷儿俩每天挣两万多，全家都做了新衣服，最近还做了两床新被。其他人家也一样。你晚上到这个院子去，就能看到家家户户在烙饼、做面条或吃馒头。院里九个年青人，现在都在区里的成人夜校学习文化，每星期六他们向全院的人读报。院里的人都说：“毛主席领导着咱，咱们大院一年比一年强了。毛主席要咱们干什么，咱们就干什么，日子还会一天比一天好。”刘实
    “我们战胜了肮脏和疾病”
    编辑同志：更楼乡甘溪村是浙江省寿昌县爱国卫生工作做得较好的一个村子。这个村子九十五户农民，养有二十多头牛和千余只鸡鸭，但在村里看不到一点牛粪、鸡屎和柴草垃圾。屋前屋后的厕所也打扫得很干净，有些坑座上加了木盖，有些坑前用草帘或蔑垫遮起来了。从七月份起，全村已进行了十多次大扫除，做到户户打扫、人人动手。军属方寿林家里的花格子窗，已经五十多年没洗了，脏得不像样子，这次爱国卫生运动中，他们一家子把窗子一格格都洗得干干净净，使这座古老的房子也焕然一新。现在任何一个农民家里，被头、帐子、日用家具甚至门窗板壁全都刷洗得干干净净，看了真使人觉到爽快。全村农民都注意个人卫生了，做到了勤换衣、多洗澡，孩子们的手脸衣服也不再是肮脏的了。饮食方面更重视，没有人再吃馊臭腐烂的东西和喝生水；饮水和用水也严格分开，用池水、饮井水，井上并都加了盖。苍蝇、蚊子、跳蚤……经过群众性的扑灭已大为减少，热天晚上没有蚊帐也能安安稳稳地睡觉。总之，讲卫生，爱清洁已经成为全村群众的新风气。
    甘溪村爱国卫生运动的成绩是和宣传员黄小香的努力分不开的。黄小香是更楼乡妇女主任，她听了关于美帝国主义进行细菌战的报告和开展爱国卫生运动的号召后，回村就在群众中广泛宣传，并且以实际行动来影响大家。她首先把自己家中里里外外洗刷个干净，简直是整个屋子洗了一个澡，人住在里面真是舒服。左邻右居看了都很羡慕，不由得也跟着打扫起来了。她紧接着组织自己小组内的十户妇女行动起来，然后召开妇女会向全村挑战。于是，爱国卫生运动在全村热火朝天地开展起来了。
    “怎样能够使家家户户经常保持清洁呢？”黄小香和村干部们商量了办法，决定建立检查制度，开展批评和表扬。于是，村里成立了检查组，每组选出检查员。检查员随时检查督促；检查组在一定时期内进行普查评比，好的表扬，坏的批评。这样，甘溪村的卫生运动就转向了经常化，并且还带动了更楼乡的其他村。
    由于卫生运动的开展，今年夏秋两季全村没有一个泻肚子、发疟疾的人。黄小香马上抓住这件活的事实又向群众宣传，使卫生运动更加巩固、深入。
    现在村里人们常常高兴地谈论着：“毛主席不但领导我们打垮封建分了田地，还领导我们战胜了肮脏、疾病，过着愉快清净的日子。”
