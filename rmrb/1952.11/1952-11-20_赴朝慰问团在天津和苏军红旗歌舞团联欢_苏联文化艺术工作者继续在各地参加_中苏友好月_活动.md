Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, November 19th: The Second Chinese People's Comfort Mission to Korea, returning from Korea, and the Soviet Red Flag Song and Dance Ensemble held a joint celebration in Tianjin on the afternoon of the 19th. At the meeting, Liu Jingfan, head of the General Delegation, said: "I believe that through your performances in various parts of China, you will not only give greater encouragement to the Chinese people, but also to the Korean and Chinese People's forces on the Korean front. This will strengthen our power to resist America, aid Korea, and defend world peace."

The head of the Soviet Red Flag Song and Dance Ensemble, representative Nikasin, spoke. After praising the great contribution of the Korean and Chinese People's forces in the struggle to defend world peace, he said: "Our Chinese and Soviet people are watching the conspiracies of the warmongers. We are not afraid of the danger of war provoked by American imperialism, because the consolidation and unity of the friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people are unbreakable; the strength of the alliance between the Chinese and Soviet people is an invincible force. The 'Sino-Soviet Friendship Month' currently underway is a clear and practical example."
