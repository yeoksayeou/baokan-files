Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 1st - The newspapers here published an article by Kim Il-sung, Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army, to commemorate the second anniversary of the Chinese People's Volunteers entering the Korean War. The title of the article is "Our Righteous Common Struggle Will Surely Be Victorious."

General Kim Il-sung wrote: On the occasion of commemorating the second anniversary of the Chinese People's Volunteers' participation in the war to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, the Korean people extend the highest honor and gratitude to the great fraternal Chinese people, the commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteers, and Chairman Mao Zedong.

General Kim Il-sung pointed out: The participation of the Chinese People's Volunteers in the Korean front has great significance in the moral relationship of the historical friendship between the Chinese and Korean peoples, in consolidating national defense, and in maintaining world peace and security, especially peace and security in the Far East. It is a clear manifestation of noble internationalism. He said: The participation of the Chinese People's Volunteers in the Korean front fundamentally reversed the situation in Korea in the second stage of the Korean people's struggle, causing the Americans to flee 250 to 300 kilometers in a month, thereby liberating the democratic base of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea from the temporary occupation of the armed interventionists. Moreover, the joint fighting of the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army shattered the plans of U.S. imperialism and laid the foundation for our final victory.

General Kim Il-sung pointed out: In the struggle against the U.S. imperialist armed interventionists on the Korean battlefield, the comradeship and brotherly friendship between the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers have been further consolidated. The Chinese People's Volunteers embody the lofty spirit of patriotism and proletarian internationalism. Their high degree of political consciousness demonstrates that they have received an education that combines lofty patriotism and proletarian internationalism. Over the past two years, thousands upon thousands of commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteers have displayed unparalleled bravery and heroism. Their bravery has made the American generals, who boasted so much about American military technology, appear incompetent. The soldiers of the Korean People's Army are deeply studying the experience of the Chinese People's Volunteers units, which have cultivated 139 heroes in the fight against U.S. imperialist armed intervention. The Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has praised the special merits of the commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteers, and has awarded tens of thousands of commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteers with republic medals and awards.

General Kim Il-sung further said: From the commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteers participating in the Korean War, we Korean people have seen the new children of glorious People's China led by the great Communist Party of China and its leader, Comrade Mao Zedong. We have seen the true face of a noble and pure new type of person who regards the hardships of the Korean people as their own and strives to overcome them. Comrade Luo Shengjiao, the glorious son of the Chinese people, sacrificed his life to save a Korean boy who had fallen into the river. The determination written in Comrade Luo Shengjiao's posthumous poem is precisely the common determination of all the commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteers who are participating in the war in our country today. When the Chinese People's Volunteers set out for the Korean front, they swore before their motherland, their party, their leader, and their people: "...Respect the customs and habits of the Korean people, cherish every mountain, river, tree, and blade of grass in Korea, and unite with the Korean people and the Korean People's Army to completely and thoroughly eliminate the American aggressors." They have brilliantly fulfilled this solemn oath. General Kim Il-sung said: We Korean people respect and cherish the commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteers, treating them as our own brothers and children.

General Kim Il-sung concluded: In the two years of war, our Korean People's Army and Chinese People's Volunteers have become an invincible force. Our troops have been further strengthened. The experience and capabilities of our soldiers and commanders have become richer and improved. We have full confidence in victory. Currently, in the armistice negotiations, the Americans are using all sorts of tricks such as rumors, deception, and threats. However, if they think that they can achieve their goals by such methods, it will be another miscalculation and foolishness on the part of the Americans.

    中国人民志愿军入朝作战两周年
    金日成将军著文纪念
    【新华社平壤一日电】此间各报刊载朝鲜人民军最高司令官金日成将军为纪念中国人民志愿军入朝作战两周年而写的一篇文章，题目是“我们正义的共同斗争是一定要胜利的”。
    金日成将军写道：在纪念中国人民志愿军抗美援朝参战两周年的时候，朝鲜人民向伟大的兄弟般的中国人民、中国人民志愿军指挥员、战斗员和毛泽东主席，致以无上的荣誉和感谢。
    金日成将军指出：中国人民志愿军的参加朝鲜战线，在中朝两国人民历史友谊的道义关系上、在巩固祖国国防上、以及在维护世界和平与安全特别是远东和平与安全上，有着巨大的意义，是高尚的国际主义的鲜明表现。他说：中国人民志愿军参加朝鲜战线，在朝鲜人民斗争的第二个阶段根本地扭转了朝鲜的局势，使美国人在一个月内逃窜了二百五十到三百公里，从而使朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的民主基地从武装干涉者的暂时侵占下得到解放。不仅如此，中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军的并肩作战，粉碎了美帝国主义的计划，奠定了我们最后胜利的基础。
    金日成将军指出：在朝鲜战场上反抗美帝国主义武装干涉者的斗争中，朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军之间的战友团结和兄弟般的友谊更加巩固了。中国人民志愿军体现了崇高的爱国主义精神和无产阶级国际主义精神。他们的高度的政治自觉性，正说明他们受到了崇高的爱国主义和无产阶级国际主义相结合的教养。两年来，成千成万的中国人民志愿军指挥员战斗员们，发挥了无比的勇敢和英雄主义精神，他们的勇敢使大吹大擂美军技术的美国将军们显得无能了。朝鲜人民军的将士们正在深刻地研究着在反对美帝国主义武装干涉的战斗中培养出一百三十九位英雄的中国人民志愿军连队的经验。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国最高人民会议常任委员会赞扬中国人民志愿军指挥员、战斗员的特殊功勋，以共和国的勋章和奖章赠给数万名中国人民志愿军的指挥员和战斗员。
    金日成将军又说：我们朝鲜人民从参加朝鲜战线的中国人民志愿军指战员身上，看到了伟大的中国共产党及其领袖毛泽东同志所领导的光荣的人民中国的新儿女，看到了把朝鲜人民的艰难困苦当成自己的艰难困苦并为克服这种艰难困苦而奋斗努力的崇高而纯洁的新型人物的真面貌。中国人民的光荣的儿子罗盛教同志看到朝鲜少年失足落江而牺牲自己的生命救出了朝鲜少年。罗盛教同志在其遗诗中所写下的决心，正是今天在我国参加作战的全体中国人民志愿军指挥员、战斗员的共同决心。中国人民志愿军在向朝鲜前线出发之时，曾在自己的祖国、党、领袖和人民面前这样宣誓：“……尊重朝鲜人民的风俗习惯，爱护朝鲜的一山一水、一草一木，与朝鲜人民和朝鲜人民军团结一致，完全彻底消灭美国侵略军。”他们辉煌地实践了这一严肃的宣誓。金日成将军说：我们朝鲜人民尊敬和爱护中国人民志愿军指挥员、战斗员，把他们当作自己的亲兄弟和子女一样。
    金日成将军最后写道：在两年的战争中，我们朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军已成为不可战胜的力量。我们的部队进一步加强了。我们的战士们和指挥官们的经验和能力更加丰富和提高了。我们有着充分的胜利信心。目前停战谈判中，美国人虽使用造谣、欺骗和威胁等种种伎俩，但是，如果他们认为用这种方法就可以达到他们的目的，那又将是美国人的错误算盘和愚蠢。
