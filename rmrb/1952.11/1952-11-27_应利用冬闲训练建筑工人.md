    We should utilize the slack winter season to train construction workers

    To the Editor: I believe it is very necessary to use the slack winter season to train construction workers. Once, we launched a Red Banner competition at the site. Because the workers did not understand the purpose of the competition, which is to make the project economical, good, and fast, and to build the country better, their enthusiasm in the competition was sometimes high and sometimes low. They often neglected the quality of the project in order to simply win the Red Banner. This hinders the completion of the country's construction tasks. Our country is about to begin large-scale economic construction, and our construction workers must undertake this important task. We must strengthen our political, technical, and cultural learning, otherwise we will not be able to keep up with the needs of the work.

    I hope that the workers participating in winter training will study technology well, improve their culture, and create more wealth for the country. Fu Hongbin

    应利用冬闲训练建筑工人
    编辑同志：我认为利用冬闲时间训练建筑工人是很必要的。有一次，我们现场搞红旗竞赛，因为工人们不了解竞赛的目的，是把工程做得又省、又好、又快，把国家建设得更好，因而在竞赛中情绪时高时低。他们往往为了单纯争取红旗，而忽视了工程质量。这都是妨碍国家建设任务的完成的。我国就要开始大规模的经济建设，我们建筑工人要承担这个重大任务，必须加强政治、技术、文化学习，不然就赶不上工作的需要。
    我希望参加冬闲训练的工人们好好学习技术，提高文化，为国家创造更多的财富。    傅鸿宾
