    Cotton Purchasing Work of the Shahe County Cooperative
    Shahe County Cooperative Joint Cooperative
    After overfulfilling the advance purchase target for cotton, the Shahe County Cooperative in Hebei Province actively began purchasing cotton in September through its twenty fully prepared grassroots cotton collection stations. In one month, the county collected 732,700 catties of ginned cotton, exceeding the prefectural cooperative's assigned monthly target by 130%. It also mobilized cooperative members to store 185,000 catties of unginned cotton. Since October, the county's cooperatives have dedicated more than 80% of their manpower to cotton purchasing, acquiring 554,000 catties of ginned cotton in half a month, reaching 72.9% of the October purchasing target. They also mobilized cotton farmers to store 223,050 catties of cotton, reaching 79.6% of the October target. From September to the first half of October, 1,044,000 catties of ginned cotton have been delivered to the cotton yarn and cloth company, reaching 81.1% of the total purchased amount, basically meeting the requirements of "quick collection, quick ginning, quick baling, and quick delivery." Each cotton collection station spends only six days from cotton collection to delivery to the cotton yarn and cloth company, which means a turnover of funds every six days, twice as fast as the twelve-day turnover period stipulated by the higher-level cooperative. This saves 1.3479 billion yuan in cotton purchasing funds and 22.2408 million yuan in interest. During the cotton purchasing process, the cooperative paid cotton farmers a total of 2.4565 billion yuan in advance purchase industrial products (accounting for more than 23% of the total cotton collection amount), bringing a large quantity of industrial products to the countryside.
    The above achievements are the result of Shahe County Cooperative's earnest implementation of the spirit of increasing production and practicing economy in cotton purchasing, payment in kind, and processing, which improved work efficiency.
    During the cotton station directors' meeting, accounting meeting, and grading and weighing training class held in July and August, the Shahe County Cooperative's Raw Cotton Management Department arranged a campaign for increasing production and practicing economy in cotton purchasing. The staff of cotton collection stations in various regions formulated their own competition plans amidst a wave of mutual competition and challenges. Before cotton collection began, they worked with various systems to hold branch meetings, expanded cadre meetings, cotton farmer forums, women's meetings, cooperative member meetings, and mass meetings to fully explain the state's cotton collection policies and purchasing methods, mobilize cotton farmers to "pick and send separately, dry in the sun, and inspect for cleanliness," and overcome cotton farmers' thinking of "not needing money, not selling cotton" and "selling later for a higher price." Many cotton collection stations have bulletin boards that clearly list the grades and prices of cotton, and have standard cotton samples, standard ginning machines, and standard scales to dispel cotton farmers' concerns about inaccurate grading and oversized scales. The cooperative's salespersons and mobile cotton collection teams go to the countryside with goods, collecting cotton and paying in kind at the same time, proposing and implementing the requirement of "collecting cotton where goods are paid for there." Some cotton collection stations' graders, cotton fluffers, ginners, and balers collectively established a "joint responsibility system for competing in cotton collection": if the baler finds matches or dirty cotton in the ginned cotton, the ginner will be held accountable; if the ginner finds matches and debris, the cotton fluffer will be held accountable. In this way, everyone actively took responsibility. Many cooperatives reformed the unreasonable wage system for cotton fluffers (previously, five or six ginning machines would have one cotton fluffer, who would only receive six catties of rice per day; now, the cotton collection station uniformly finds cotton fluffers, with an average of one cotton fluffer serving five ginning machines, and wages are calculated based on the cottonseeds produced by the five ginning machines, with fourteen taels of rice paid for every hundred catties of cottonseeds, so a cotton fluffer can earn eleven catties of rice per day). Cotton collection stations and processing plants universally paid attention to the health and welfare of workers, preventing workers from drinking cold water and providing workers with various conveniences in life and production, and so on.
    As a result of these efforts, the competition movement in the cotton collection stations has developed day by day. The Dongjiujia cotton collection station overfulfilled its cotton purchasing task and handled in-kind deposit pre-purchase business, mobilizing cotton farmers to deposit 45,000 catties of unginned cotton. Cotton farmers said, "Since the cotton blossoms came early this year and the cotton collection station can't turn around in time, we should exchange more goods!" The Beizu cotton collection station collected more than 23 million yuan worth of cotton in one day, but only paid out 3 million yuan in cash, with the remaining 20 million yuan being used by the masses to order and exchange goods.
    The central link in the campaign to increase production and practice economy in various cotton collection stations and processing plants is to promote rationalization proposals and find shortcuts. The greatest achievements have been made in processing plants. Ginning workers discovered that last year's processing left a lot of fuzz on the cottonseeds, averaging four taels per hundred catties. After discussion, everyone believed that this was partly related to ginning technology and partly because the cotton that fell into the cottonseeds was not removed in time. They suggested that leading cadres: uniformly improve the ginning knives, shortening the distance between the upper and lower knives on the ginning machine from 4.5 points to 3.4 points, which made the ginned cotton longer and the cottonseeds free of fuzz; the seed cotton that fell on the cottonseeds should be picked up at any time; when passing the cottonseeds after work, carefully check the ginning machine and remove any fuzzy cottonseeds for reginning. After implementing these suggestions, each hundred catties of ginned cotton can produce four taels more than before. Similar rationalization proposals have appeared in large numbers throughout the county.
    The cotton collection, payment in kind, and cotton processing work in Shahe County has already achieved considerable success during this period, but everyone is determined to make even greater achievements. They said, "This is just the beginning of the competition!"

    沙河县合作社的购棉工作
    沙河县合作社联合社
    河北省沙河县合作社在超额完成了预购棉花的任务后，从九月开始，即在经过充分准备的二十个基层收棉站中，积极收购棉花。一个月中，全县收了七十三万二千七百斤皮棉，超过专区社分配的全月任务的百分之一百三十；并发动社员储存籽棉十八万五千斤。十月以来，全县合作社更以全部人力的百分之八十以上投入购棉工作，半个月内购进皮棉五十五万四千斤，达十月份收购任务的百分之七十二点九；并动员棉农储存棉花二十二万三千零五十斤，达十月份任务的百分之七十九点六。从九月到十月上半月，已交给花纱布公司一百零四万四千斤皮棉，达收购总数的百分之八十一点一，基本上达到了“快收、快轧、快扎包、快送交”的要求。各收棉站从收棉起到送交花纱布公司止，只用六天时间，也就是说六天周转一次资金，比上级社规定的十二天周转一次加速了一倍。这就节省了十三亿四千七百九十万元购棉资金，并节省了二千二百二十四万零八百元利息。在收购棉花的时候，合作社付给棉农总值二十四亿五千六百五十万元的预购工业品（占收棉总额的百分之二十三强），使工业品大量下乡。
    上述成绩是沙河县合作社在棉花收购、付实、加工中切实贯彻了增产节约的精神，提高了工作效率的结果。
    沙河县合作社的原棉经理部在七、八月份召开的棉站主任会、会计会和分级过秤训练班中，就布置了购棉工作中的增产节约竞赛，各地收棉站的工作人员，都在相互竞赛挑战的浪潮中，订出了自己的竞赛计划。他们在没有收棉以前，就结合各村生产工作，配合各系统开了支部会、扩大干部会、棉农座谈会、妇女会、社员大会、群众大会，充分说明国家的收棉政策和收购方式，动员棉农“分摘、分送、晒干、检净”，并且克服了棉农的“不用钱、不卖棉”和“晚卖价钱大”的思想。许多收棉站设有黑板报，明显地写着棉花的等级、价格，设有标准棉样、标准轧车和标准秤，解除棉农害怕验级不准和秤大的顾虑。合作社的业务员和流动收棉组一起，带货下乡，同时收棉，同时付给实物，提出并实行了“收棉到那里、付实到那里”的要求。有些收棉站的验级员和打花工、轧花工、扎包工集体订立了“竞赛收棉的连环负责制”：如果扎包工发现皮棉中有火柴、污棉，即追究轧花工；轧花工发现了火柴和杂物，要追究打花工，这样，大家都积极负责了。许多合作社改革了以往打花工人不合理的工资制度（以往是五、六辆轧车自找一个打花工，每天只给六斤米；现在由收棉站统一找打花工，平均一个打花工为五辆轧花车服务，工资按五辆轧花车轧出的花籽计算，每出百斤花籽付给十四两工资米，这样，一个打花工一天能得十一斤米）。各收棉站、加工厂普遍注意了工人的健康福利，不使工人喝冷水，给工人以生活与生产上各种方便，等等。
    由于进行了这些工作，收棉站的竞赛运动逐日开展起来，东九家收棉站超额完成了收购棉花的任务，并且办理了存实预购业务，动员棉农存籽棉四万五千斤。棉农都说：“既然今年棉花开的早，收棉站一时转不过来，我们应当多换货物！”北俎收棉站一天收了总值二千三百多万元的棉花，但只付出现款三百万元，其余二千万元，都是群众订换了货物。
    各收棉站、加工厂开展增产节约竞赛运动的中心环节是提倡合理化建议和找窍门。其中获得成绩最大的是加工厂。轧花工人发现去年加工时，花籽上带绒很多，每百斤平均带有四两。经过讨论，大家认为这一方面和轧花技术有关系，一方面是由于没有及时检出掉在棉籽里的棉花。他们建议领导干部：统一改进轧刀，把轧车上的上下刀的距离，由原来的四点五分缩短为三点四分，这就使轧出的棉绒长了，花籽上也没有绒了；对于掉在花籽上的籽花，也随时发现随时捡起；在下工过花籽时，要细心检查轧车，发现带毛的花籽，必须捡出再轧。执行了这些建议之后，每百斤皮棉可较前多出四两花。类似的合理化建议，在全县出现了许多。
    沙河县的收棉、付实、棉花加工工作在这一时期中已经获得不少的成绩，但大家有决心作出更大的成绩，他们说：“这才是竞赛运动的一个头哩！”
