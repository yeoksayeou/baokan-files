    "Spark" Collective Farm
    Collaboration by Wu En, Chen Qi, Xu Guang, and Gong Mei
    Sixteen. Ten fingers are not all the same length. The Jin Gen-zhu group disagreed with the new sowing method. The meeting stipulated that 220 jin should be sown per hectare, but they only sowed 180 jin. The farm chairman urged them to replant, but he didn't convince them ideologically. When the seedlings emerged, they secretly thinned the dense seedlings.

    Seventeen. Under the leadership of Chairman Jin Baishan, most of the members accepted advanced farming methods and exerted the power of collective labor. In the summer, the weather was dry and the canal water was shallow, so seven hectares of highland could not be irrigated. After mobilization, everyone worked together and irrigated the seven hectares of highland in half a day.

    Eighteen. Autumn came, and the collective farm members happily harvested. The plump rice piled up into a golden mountain. Jiang Dongxun, who had suffered losses from working independently, was particularly excited at this time.

    十六、十个指头不一般齐，金根洙小组对新的播种法不同意，会上规定每垧地播种二百二十斤、他们却只播种了一百八十斤。农庄主席督促让他们补种，但他思想上没有打通，等苗儿出齐了，又悄悄地把密苗拔稀。
    十七、大多数的庄员，都在金白山主席的领导下，接受了先进的耕作方法，发挥着集体劳动的力量。夏天里，天旱渠水浅，有七垧高地浇不上水，经动员后大家一鼓作气地，半天功夫就把七垧高地灌满了水。
    十八、秋天来了，集体农庄庄员在愉快地收获，丰满的稻谷，堆成了一座金山。在单干中吃过亏的姜东勋，这时也特别感到兴奋。
