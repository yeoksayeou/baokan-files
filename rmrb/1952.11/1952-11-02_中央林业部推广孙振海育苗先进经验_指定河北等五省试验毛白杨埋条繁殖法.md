The Central Ministry of Forestry Promotes Sun Zhenhai's Advanced Seedling Raising Experience
Designates Hebei and Five Other Provinces to Experiment with the Populus tomentosa Burying-Branch Propagation Method

    In order to promote the Populus tomentosa burying-branch propagation method successfully tested by Sun Zhenhai, a worker at the Western Suburb Nursery of the Beijing Branch of the Tianjin Railway Administration, the Ministry of Forestry of the Central People's Government recently notified the Agricultural and Forestry Departments of the People's Governments of Hebei, Pingyuan, Henan, Shandong, and Shaanxi provinces to conduct cultivation experiments and trial promotion of this advanced seedling raising method starting this autumn. The notice pointed out that Populus tomentosa is the most suitable tree species for afforestation in sandy wastelands and for creating shelterbelts. It has a wide range of uses and is much loved by the masses. However, in the past, this tree species was difficult to propagate. Sun Zhenhai's burying-branch propagation method has solved this difficulty and is of decisive significance for vigorously carrying out Populus tomentosa afforestation in the future. Therefore, it is hoped that the above-mentioned provinces will designate nurseries to conduct cultivation and experiments, and after gaining experience and mastering the technology, vigorously promote it.
    Sun Zhenhai's Populus tomentosa burying-branch propagation method, after being introduced by this newspaper (see page 2 of this newspaper, July 9th), has attracted widespread attention from forestry workers in various regions. In the past few months, more than 300 people have visited the Western Suburb Nursery of the Beijing Branch of the Tianjin Railway Administration. The Central Ministry of Forestry, the Central Forestry Research Institute, the Cadre School of the Central Ministry of Forestry, the North China Administrative Committee's Agricultural and Forestry Water Conservancy Bureau, and other units have successively sent people to conduct on-site investigations and research. Soviet forestry experts have also come to the site for inspection. Everyone recognizes that Sun Zhenhai's Populus tomentosa burying-branch propagation method is a great creation of New China's forestry workers, providing favorable conditions for large-scale forestry construction in the motherland in the future. This propagation method not only solves the problem of mass production of Populus tomentosa, but also provides new inspiration for the propagation of other tree species. All tree species that are difficult to reproduce sexually and whose tree branches sprout and are difficult to survive when cuttings are inserted in the spring can apply the principles of this propagation method.

    中央林业部推广孙振海育苗先进经验
    指定河北等五省试验毛白杨埋条繁殖法
    为了推广天津铁路管理局北京分局西郊苗圃工人孙振海试验成功的毛白杨埋条繁殖法，中央人民政府林业部于最近通知河北、平原、河南、山东、陕西五省人民政府农林厅，从今年秋天开始进行培育试验，试行推广这一先进育苗法。通知中指出：毛白杨是最适宜在沙荒造林和营造防护林的树种。它的用途极广，很为群众所喜爱。但是过去这种树种很难繁殖，孙振海的埋条繁殖法解决了这个困难，对今后大力开展毛白杨造林，具有决定的意义。因此希望上述各省指定苗圃，进行培育和试验，等到取得经验和掌握技术以后，即可大力推广。
    孙振海的毛白杨埋条繁殖法，经本报介绍后（见本报七月九日二版），已引起了各地林业工作者的普遍重视。几个月来，前往天津铁路管理局北京分局西郊苗圃参观的人员已达三百多人。中央林业部、中央林业研究所、中央林业部干部学校、华北行政委员会农林水利局等单位先后派人到现地调查研究，苏联林业专家也到现地考察，大家公认孙振海的毛白杨埋条繁殖法，是新中国林业工人的一个伟大创造，给今后祖国大规模的林业建设提供了有利条件。这个繁殖法不仅解决了毛白杨的大量生产的问题，并且给繁殖其他树种提供了新的启示，凡有性繁殖困难，树条萌芽在春季插条又难以成活的树种，都可以运用这个繁殖方法的原理。
