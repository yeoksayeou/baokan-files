    Xinhua News Agency, New York, 1st: Although the Democratic and Republican parties in the United States are stepping up their use of radio and television broadcasts to conduct the final stages of campaign propaganda for their candidates, the ordinary people of the United States are not interested in these deceptive tricks. A message from United Press reporter Montalou from New York on October 25 illustrates this fact.
    Montalou said that although "radio and television broadcast (the two parties' campaign) political news all day long, the television sets in grocery stores on the street do not show political programs." Montalou investigated nine stores equipped with television sets and found that eight of them were showing football games, and the other was showing acrobatics. The owner of one store said: "Passersby like to stop and watch football games. But no one wants to stop and watch politicians, not even Eisenhower, Stevenson, or Truman. It seems that people are a bit tired of politics."
    Wherever Montalou went, he found very few people who showed any concern about the election. A bartender told him that the customers who came to drink "do not want to listen to political news (on the radio and television)." A barber also said that customers rarely mentioned the election; they preferred to talk about other things. Montalou went into a park, chatted with a policeman on the lawn where children were playing, and the policeman showed no enthusiasm for the two-party election campaigns. He regarded the election as a routine matter and said, "I will vote, but why talk about politics?" Montalou said: "This kind of situation is almost everywhere."

    美国人民对两党竞选反应冷淡
    【新华社一日讯】纽约消息：美国民主与共和两党虽然正在加紧利用无线电和电视广播为它们的候选人进行最后阶段的竞选宣传，但是美国的普通人民对这种骗人的把戏却并不感到兴趣。合众社记者蒙塔娄十月二十五日发自纽约的一条消息说明了这个事实。
    蒙塔娄说，虽然“无线电和电视成天播送（两党竞选的）政治新闻，但街头的杂货店的电视器都不放映政治节目”。蒙塔娄调查了九家装有电视设备的店铺，发现其中八家的电视器都在放映足球比赛，另一家在放映杂技。一家店铺的老板说：“过路人欢喜停下来看足球比赛。但是没有人愿意停下来看一看政治家，即使是艾森豪威尔、史蒂文森或杜鲁门，也都没有人要看。看起来人们对政治有点厌倦了。”
    不论蒙塔娄走到哪里，他都发现很少有人对大选表示关心。酒排间的侍者告诉他说：来喝酒的顾客都“不要听（无线电和电视里的）政治新闻”。一个理发匠也说，顾客们很少提到有关大选的事，他们宁愿谈论别的事情。蒙塔娄走进公园，在小孩游玩的草地上和一个警察攀谈，这个警察对两党竞选毫无热情，他把选举当作例行公事说：“我会去投票，但为什么要谈政治呢？”蒙塔娄说：“像这样的情形，差不多到处都是。”
