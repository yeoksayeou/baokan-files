    Farmers Should Be Discouraged from Blindly Migrating to Cities
    Central People's Government Ministry of Internal Affairs Social Affairs Department
    Recently, many regions have discovered a phenomenon of surplus rural labor force blindly flowing into cities. Most of them hold letters of introduction or migration certificates from local people's governments, and some even bring their families, moving around and requesting subsidies from people's governments along the way. For example, in Beijing's Nan Yuan District, from August 10th to 23rd, there were more than 800 farmers from other places seeking work. They mostly came from Tong County, Wuqing, Anci and other places near Beijing. In Chongqing, during labor employment registration work, unemployed people introduced from Jiangbei, Lu County and other places were also discovered. According to statistics from September 9th to 11th alone, there were 35 people, some of whom were unwilling to farm, returning the land they had been allocated to the farmers' association to specifically find work in Chongqing. In addition, similar situations have been found in Shanxi, Southern Jiangsu, Xi'an, Qinhuangdao and other places.
    The reason for this phenomenon of farmers blindly migrating to cities is mainly that some cadres in certain areas (mainly district and village cadres) do not understand the spirit of the "Decision on Labor Employment Issues" promulgated by the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government. This decision pointed out: "The development of cities and industry, and the development of national construction in various aspects, will absorb batches of labor from rural areas, but this work must be carried out in a planned and step-by-step manner, and it is impossible to absorb a large amount in a short period of time. Therefore, it is necessary to vigorously persuade farmers to overcome the mentality of blindly migrating to cities." Some cadres have not seriously studied and understood the significance of this instruction, and do not understand that the country's economic construction work is carried out in a planned and step-by-step manner, and that the problem of surplus rural labor force must be gradually resolved with the development of various construction works, and cannot be resolved all at once. They not only fail to dissuade farmers from blindly flowing into cities, but instead adopt an irresponsible attitude of pushing them out the door. Some village cadres in Shanxi Province, fearing that issuing letters of introduction to farmers would be criticized by their superiors, told the farmers: "You can find work in the city even without a letter of introduction." This irresponsible phenomenon has fueled the blind migration of farmers to cities. The result is not only a waste of a lot of national funds and affecting social order, but also adding many unnecessary difficulties to the people's governments in various places. It is also very unfavorable for the farmers, because they blindly run to the cities and cannot find work for a while, so they have to sell their clothes, bedding and other items and embark on the road of vagrancy. Therefore, people's governments in various places should pay close attention to this situation, immediately take effective measures to dissuade farmers from blindly migrating to cities, especially in the winter, and prevent farmers from blindly migrating to avoid unfortunate events caused by hunger and cold.
    Our country is about to begin large-scale economic construction, and of course we must concentrate our efforts on developing industry first. But developing agriculture is equally important. If the development of agricultural economy cannot keep up with the needs of industrial development, it will affect the progress of industrial construction. Cadres of people's governments at all levels should recognize this point, and should also know that the current labor employment is mainly to solve the problem of unemployment, and that the surplus rural labor force are not unemployed; they have land to cultivate and food to eat. The reason why the surplus rural labor force is blindly flowing to the cities today is because their potential labor capacity has not been brought into play. According to the spirit of the "Decision on Labor Employment Issues," the correct way to solve this problem should be: in coordination with various rural economic constructions, with the development of agricultural production as the main focus, combined with the development of sideline occupations, actively organize, and develop mutual aid and cooperation. Cadres of people's governments at all levels should, on the one hand, vigorously persuade and dissuade farmers who blindly flow into cities, explain the advantages and disadvantages, and clarify their thinking so that they can settle down to production; at the same time, they should also advocate the construction of small-scale water conservancy, reward afforestation, build rural roads, develop freshwater fisheries and various sideline occupations and handicrafts, and advocate preliminary processing of local specialties in rural areas to open up product sales channels, so as to solve the problem of surplus rural labor force. Secondly, we should expand the area of cultivated land, plan to immigrate and reclaim wasteland, absorb and train semi-intellectuals in rural areas so that they can participate in cultural education, medical and health work, and the most basic technical guidance work in agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and fisheries. This will not only effectively solve the problem of finding outlets for surplus rural labor force, but also promote the further development of the rural economy.

    应劝阻农民盲目向城市流动
    中央人民政府内务部社会司
    近来有不少地区发现农村剩余劳动力盲目流入城市。他们大多持有地方人民政府的证明信或迁移证，其中有的并携带家眷到处流动，沿途要求人民政府补助。如北京市南苑区在八月十日到二十三日，就有外来找工作的农民八百多人。他们多来自邻近北京的通县、武清和安次等地。重庆市在劳动就业登记工作中，也发现由江北、泸县等地介绍来的失业人员，仅九月九日到十一日统计，就有三十五人，其中有的人是不愿种地，把已分得的土地交回农民协会，专门到重庆找工作的。此外，山西、苏南、西安、秦皇岛等地也都发现类似情况。
    这种农民盲目向城市流动的现象所以发生，主要是有些地区的干部（主要是区、村干部）不了解中央人民政府政务院所颁布的“关于劳动就业问题的决定”的精神。这一决定中曾经指出：“城市与工业的发展，国家各方面建设的发展，将要从农村吸收整批的劳动力，但这一工作必须是有计划有步骤的进行，而且在短时期内不可能大量吸收。故必须大力说服农民，以克服农民盲目地向城市流动的情绪。”有些干部没有认真研究和领会这一指示的意义，不懂得国家经济建设工作是有计划有步骤地进行的，而农村的剩余劳动力问题必须随着各种建设工作的开展而逐步解决，并非一下就可以解决的。他们对农民盲目流入城市不但不加劝阻，反而采取推出门了事的不负责任态度。山西省有些村干部怕给农民开介绍信会受上级的批评，便对农民说：“不用介绍信，进城也可以做工。”这种不负责任的现象，助长了农民向城市盲目流动。其结果不但浪费了国家许多钱财，影响社会秩序，而且给各地人民政府增加了许多不必要的困难。对于农民来说也很不利，因为他们盲目跑到城市，一时找不到工作，便只好卖掉衣服被褥等物，走上流浪的道路。因此各地人民政府应密切注意这种情况，立即采取有效措施，劝阻农民盲目向城市流动，特别是在冬令时期，更应防止农民盲目流动，免得因饥寒而造成不幸事件。
    我们国家即将开始大规模经济建设，当然要集中力量首先发展工业。但发展农业也同样重要。如果农业经济的发展赶不上工业发展的需要，就会影响工业建设的进行。各级人民政府的干部应该认识这一点，并且要知道目前的劳动就业主要是解决失业问题，而农村的剩余劳动力并不是失业者，他们有地种，有饭吃。今天农村的剩余劳动力所以盲目向城市流动，是因为他们的劳动潜在能力未能发挥出来。根据“关于劳动就业问题的决定”的精神，解决这一问题的正确办法应该是：配合农村的各种经济建设，以开展农业生产为主，结合发展副业，积极组织起来，发展互助合作。各级人民政府的干部应该一方面对盲目向城市流动的农民，大力说服和劝阻，讲明利害，打通思想，使他们安心生产；同时还应提倡兴修小型水利，奖励植树造林，修筑农村公路，发展淡水渔业和各种副业及手工业，并提倡土特产品先在农村初步加工，打开产品的销路等，以便解决农村剩余劳动力问题。其次应扩大耕地面积，有计划地移民垦荒，吸收和训练农村中的半知识分子，使他们能够参加文化教育和医药卫生工作及农林牧畜等最初级的技术指导工作。这样作不但能够有效地解决农村剩余劳动力的出路问题，而且可以促进农村经济进一步发展。
