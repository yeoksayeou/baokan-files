    "Spark" Collective Farm
    Cooperation: Wu En, Chen Qi, Xu Guang, Gong Mei
    19. Good news arrived! The collective farm's unit yield per hectare is 8,430 jin. Every family's granary is filled with rice. Jiang Dongxun, with only one unit of labor, received 12,000 jin.

    20. Another painful lesson. Jin Genzhu's group, due to sparse planting in their fields, harvested 2,000 jin less rice per hectare. Faced with the facts, he understood the benefits of advanced experience, expressed his willingness to obey the organization, and pledged to study technology diligently in the future.

    21. The first year of victory has passed. The spark has shone its light, and every corner of the motherland is sending congratulations. Let's develop and strengthen this emerging collective farm even faster, and let this glorious banner forever flutter across the land of our motherland!

    “星火”集体农庄

    十九、捷报传来了，集体农庄的每垧地单位产量是八千四百三十斤，家家稻谷装满了囤，姜东勋仅只一个劳动力，就分得了一万二千斤。
    二十、又是一个惨痛的教训，金根洙小组稀播的地里，每垧地少收了稻谷两千斤。在事实的面前，他明白了先进经验的好处，表示愿意服从组织，今后要好好研究技术。
    二十一、胜利的第一年过去了，星星之火放射出光芒，祖国的各个角落，都在向它祝贺。让我们这个新兴的集体农庄更快地发展壮大吧，让这一面光辉的旗帜，在我们祖国的大地上永远飘扬！
