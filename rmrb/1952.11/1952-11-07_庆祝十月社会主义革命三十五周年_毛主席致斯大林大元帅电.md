    Celebrating the Thirty-Fifth Anniversary of the October Socialist Revolution
    Chairman Mao's Telegram to Marshal Stalin
    To Comrade Stalin, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics:
    On the occasion of the thirty-fifth anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution, I, on behalf of the Chinese people, the Government of the People's Republic of China, and in my own name, extend my heartfelt congratulations to the glorious Soviet people, the Soviet government, and to you.
    The Chinese people congratulate with great joy the great Soviet people on the incomparably brilliant achievements they have made in the cause of communist construction. These achievements give new and powerful encouragement to the Chinese people, who are about to carry out large-scale economic construction, and to the working people of the world.
    We congratulate the Soviet people on the great achievements they have made in their unremitting struggle to safeguard and consolidate international peace. These achievements have repeatedly frustrated the conspiracies of warmongers and have increased a thousandfold the confidence of peace-loving people around the world in defending peace and stopping war.
    I wish victory to the cause of defending peace in the Far East and the world, and I wish the unbreakable great friendship between China and the Soviet Union will be further consolidated and developed.
    Mao Zedong, Chairman of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China
