    Found a Prescription for Eyeglasses

    Comrade Editor: I am a staff member of the Yishan Special District Cooperative in Guangxi Province. I have an eye problem, and I got a pair of glasses at the Tianjin Municipal Central Hospital (now renamed Tianjin General Hospital) four or five years ago. I rely on these glasses to read, write, and work, and I can't do without them for a moment. Unfortunately, I lost my glasses while working in the countryside this June. I couldn't get a good new pair of glasses locally. The doctor at Yishan People's Hospital told me, "It would be best if you could find the prescription you used to get your glasses before; or write to the original hospital to ask them to check." I thought: My glasses were made four or five years ago, and I don't even remember the year or month I got them; even if the original prescription was still there, who would bother to look for it for me? However, with no other choice, I reluctantly wrote a letter to Tianjin General Hospital to give it a try.

    To my surprise, I soon received a letter from Dr. Yuan Jiaqin of Tianjin General Hospital (she was the doctor who originally examined and fitted my glasses). Not only did she send me the old prescription, but she also considered the possible increase in my prescription when getting new glasses, and she also told me in detail what problems to pay attention to when getting new glasses. I was excited, I was moved, and I showed the letter to my comrades, who all said in unison, "Truly a people's hospital, a people's doctor!" From this incident, I deeply realized the growth of a new atmosphere in the new society.

    找到了配眼镜的处方
    编辑同志：我是广西省宜山专区合作社的一个工作人员。我的眼睛有病，四、五年前在前天津市立中央医院（现在已改为天津总医院）配了一付眼镜。我依靠这付眼镜看书、写字和工作，一时都不能离开它。不幸，今年六月间我下乡工作时把眼镜丢失了。在当地配新眼镜，始终配不好。宜山人民医院的医师对我说：“你最好能够找到过去配眼镜时的处方；或者向原来配眼镜的医院写信，请他们查一下。”我想：我的眼镜是四、五年前配的，那一年、那一月配的我自己也记不清楚；就是原处方还在，谁能找这个麻烦替我查呢？但是，没有办法，我抱着试一试的态度勉强写了一封信给天津总医院。
    出乎我意料之外，不久后，我就接到天津总医院袁佳琴大夫（她就是原来给我验配眼镜的大夫）的来信。她不但把旧处方给我寄来，还考虑到我新配眼镜时可能增加的度数，又详细地告诉我配新眼镜时要注意那些问题。我兴奋，我感动，我把信拿给同志们看，同志们都异口同声地说：“真是人民的医院，人民的医师！”从这件事，我深刻地体会到新社会里新气象的生长。
