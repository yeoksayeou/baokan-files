Xinhua News Agency, Prague—New York’s "Workers Daily" published an open letter on November 10 addressed to President-elect Eisenhower, care of the Augusta National Golf Club in Augusta, Georgia. The letter questioned Eisenhower: "Why can't you put down your golf clubs now and take some time to immediately meet with Truman and jointly order the commanders in the field to negotiate a truce?"

The letter discussed the increasing number of American casualties in Korea while Eisenhower was playing golf. It stated: "When we see your beaming smile, we cannot dispel the agonizing cries of Korean women and children being burned alive by napalm, which fill our ears."

The letter reminded Eisenhower: "Undoubtedly, during the election campaign, you deliberately wanted to make the people believe that your intention was not to continue or expand the bloodshed but to end it!"

The letter concluded: "We believe you will hear the voices of millions of Americans…demanding an immediate ceasefire. The American people demand peace in Korea now, and they must get it."

Xinhua News Agency, Prague, November 19—According to a report in New York’s "Workers Daily" on November 11: The president of Local 758 of the International Mine, Mill and Smelter Workers Union in Chicago, Bey, and business representative Binda wrote to Eisenhower, asking him to fulfill his promise and quickly end the Korean War.

Copies of the letter to Eisenhower were also distributed to union members. The letter pointed out that the union did not endorse any presidential candidate in either party's campaign because the union "believes that neither party's presidential candidates nor their platforms are satisfactory to labor." The letter emphasized that the union would fight back against the attacks of big business on labor and said: "We don't want war, we don't want economic depression."

    美国“工人日报”和工会组织
    质问艾森豪威尔违背诺言
    【新华社布拉格讯】纽约“工人日报”于十一月十日发表了该报寄至佐治亚州奥古斯大地方的奥古斯大全国高尔夫球俱乐部转给新当选的美国总统艾森豪威尔的一封公开信，这封信向艾森豪威尔质问道：“为什么现在你不能够放下高尔夫球抽出点时间来立刻与杜鲁门会晤并共同命令战场上的各司令官谈判停战问题呢？”
    这封信谈到美国在朝鲜伤亡人数日益增加而艾森豪威尔却在玩高尔夫球，信里说：“当我们看到你那春风满面的笑容的时候，我们却不能驱散充满我们耳边的正在被凝固汽油弹烧死的朝鲜妇女和儿童们的痛苦呼声。”
    这封信提醒艾森豪威尔说：无疑地，你在竞选运动期间曾故意要使人民相信你的意图不是要继续或扩大流血而是要结束流血！
    这封信最后说：“我们相信：你将听到千千万万美国人民……要求立即停战的呼声。美国人民要求现在在朝鲜实现和平，而且他们一定要得到它。”
    【新华社布拉格十九日电】据纽约“工人日报”十一日报道：芝加哥国际开采冶炼工人工会第七五八分会主席贝依和事务主任宾达写信给艾森豪威尔，要求他履行他的诺言，迅速结束朝鲜战争。
    给艾森豪威尔的信的副本也分给了工会会员。这封信中指出：工会在两党竞选运动中并不拥护任何一个总统候选人，因为工会“认为两党的总统候选人或党纲都不是劳工所满意的”。这封信中强调，工会将给予向大企业对劳工的进攻以反击，并且说：“我们不要战争，我们不要经济萧条。”
