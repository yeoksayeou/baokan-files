    The Soviet Union—A Powerful Socialist Nation
    Soviet Doctor of Philosophy Vi. Nikolaev
    The Soviet people and the working people of the world solemnly celebrate the thirty-fifth anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution, the most glorious festival. They recall with pride the historically significant day of November 7, 1917, when the Russian workers and peasants, led by the Lenin-Stalin Party, overthrew the regime of the landlords and capitalists, thus creating the first Soviet socialist state in the world. If in all previous societies the state had been a machine for the exploiting classes to suppress the people, then, as a result of the socialist revolution, for the first time in history, political power was transferred to the hands of the people. This power has become a tool to free the masses from exploitation, oppression, poverty, and ignorance, a tool to build a new socialist life. The Soviet socialist state is the primary tool in the hands of workers and peasants to build communism and defend the motherland from foreign invaders.
    From the very first day of its birth, the Soviet socialist state has unremittingly engaged in the struggle to defend world peace. Lenin and Stalin's Decree on Peace: immediately begin a just, democratic peace—peace without annexations or indemnities—was one of the first decrees of the Soviet regime.
    Throughout the thirty-five years of the Soviet state's existence, the Soviet Union's consistent and tireless struggle for peace and cooperation among all nations has demonstrated to all mankind that the Soviet Union is a powerful and indestructible bulwark of world peace.
    For more than thirty years, the sincere and open foreign policy of peace pursued by the Soviet state has reflected the vital interests of all the Soviet people. This policy has won the deep sympathy and universal recognition of all progressive humanity.
    The Soviet state is a state of the dictatorship of the proletariat, a new and higher form of state, fundamentally different from bourgeois states. The October Socialist Revolution, which founded the Soviet state, showed the world for the first time the ability of the working masses to establish a social and state life without the bourgeoisie and landlords, and against the bourgeoisie and landlords. The Soviet people initially destroyed the power of the exploiting classes, and then eliminated them. Thus, for the first time since the entire world history of social classes, the phenomenon of man exploiting man and the extremely unjust system of parasites and oppressors of the people living off the labor of the people was eradicated and eliminated. If, in previous periods, the working people only enjoyed a small portion of the wealth created by their labor, while the vast majority of these riches fell into the hands of the exploiters, then the Soviet people, following Lenin and Stalin's great ideas about socialism, were able to create such a society in which all the material benefits and cultural treasures created by human labor benefit all the working people and the entire socialist society. Under the conditions of the Soviet state system, new sources of rapid growth of productive forces and new sources for the development of culture and the improvement of the people's material welfare have been opened up.
    Marxism-Leninism teaches that history is made by the people. The multi-ethnic Soviet socialist state, created by the genius of Lenin and Stalin, is the first state in human history to unleash the abilities, initiative, and creative talents of the masses to fight for communism. The implementation of Lenin and Stalin's national policy enabled all nationalities living in Russia to establish an unshakable friendly cooperation. The Russian people, who showed selfless brotherly assistance to all other nationalities in socialist construction, are the leading force among all the nationalities of the Soviet Union.
    The multi-ethnic Soviet Union is a great and friendly alliance of free and equal nations. The Soviet state ensured the elimination of political, economic, and cultural inequalities among all the nationalities of the Soviet Union. Formerly backward nationalities have, in a short period, reached the level of advanced nationalities in terms of economic development, as well as in terms of culture that is national in form and socialist in content.
    In the Soviet Union, the unprecedented moral and political unity of Soviet society and the friendship of all nationalities have been formed and consolidated, and vigorous Soviet patriotism has flourished. All of these have become a powerful driving force of socialist society. The Soviet state is the most democratic state in the world. It not only declares, but also fully guarantees the realization of these democratic rights and civil liberties: the right to work, the right to education, the right to rest, the right to security in old age, and the freedom of publication, assembly, and association, as well as equal rights for men and women—regardless of their nationality or race. In the Soviet Union, the unity of the people and the state is vividly manifested in the extensive development of socialist competition, in the Stakhanovite labor of millions of Soviet people, and in the unanimous support of the alliance of Party members and non-Party members in the elections of Soviet power organs. The powerful unfolding of criticism and self-criticism, with which the working people overcome all shortcomings in their work in order to accelerate the transition of Soviet society towards communism, expresses the inseparable ties between the people and the state.
    The Communist Party—the advanced detachment of the Soviet people—is the leading and guiding force of the Soviet state. Armed with the great doctrine of Marxism-Leninism, the Lenin-Stalin Party exercises political leadership over Soviet society, directing the constructive labor of the Soviet people towards the great goal—communism. It educates the working people in the spirit of Soviet patriotism, the spirit of proletarian internationalism, and the spirit of loyalty to their socialist motherland. The policy of the Communist Party is the vital foundation of the Soviet system. It expresses the fundamental interests of the working people and fully conforms to the interests of the progressive development of mankind. The Lenin-Stalin Party has won the unlimited trust and love of the people because of its selfless service to the people.
    The Soviet state, implementing the policies of the Communist Party, has achieved victories of worldwide historical significance. Relying on the alliance of the working class and the working peasantry, it broke the resistance of the overthrown exploiting classes, realized the socialist industrialization of the country and the collectivization of agriculture, thereby ensuring that a socialist society was built in the Soviet Union in a very short historical period.
    During the years of several Stalinist Five-Year Plans, the Soviet Union was transformed from a backward agricultural country into a powerful country with strong industry and collective farms. The welfare of the Soviet people and the level of their socialist culture have grown immeasurably. The socialist state knows nothing of panic or unemployment. Its national economy and culture are developing along a path of continuous improvement and prosperity.
    The most important characteristic that distinguishes the Soviet socialist state from the state of exploiting classes is that it directly organizes all the economic and cultural life of the country. The economic life of the Soviet Union is determined and guided by state-ordained national economic plans "with a view to increasing social wealth, steadily raising the material and cultural standards of the toilers, consolidating the independence of the Soviet Union and strengthening its defense capacity." ("The Constitution of the USSR").
    The great power of the Soviet state was particularly evident during the Great Patriotic War. Under the leadership of the great Stalin, the Soviet Union crushed Hitler's Germany and imperialist Japan. The Soviet people carried out their mission of liberation, saving the peoples of the world from fascist enslavement.
    The war showed that the Soviet social system and state system are a better form of social organization than any other non-Soviet social system and state system. The Soviet Union emerged from the war even stronger and more powerful.
    After the victorious conclusion of the Great Patriotic War, the Soviet state turned to peaceful and creative labor. The Soviet socialist state, led by the Communist Party, directed the power of the people towards completing the post-war Stalin Five-Year Plan, towards completing the task of the gradual transition from socialism to communism.
    In his report to the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, Comrade Malenkov cited moving figures illustrating the tremendous achievements of the Soviet people in restoring and developing the Soviet national economy.
    In the period from 1946 to 1951, the Soviet people completed the Fourth (post-war) Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule, restoring, building, and putting into operation approximately seven thousand large state-owned industrial enterprises. In 1951, the total industrial output was more than twice the level of the pre-war year of 1940. The industrial products manufactured by means of production increased by 2.4 times. Labor productivity increased by 50 percent. Socialist agriculture, equipped with first-class machinery, has seen its grain harvest increase year by year after the war, and in 1952, the total grain harvest reached eight billion poods. The national income of the Soviet Union increased by 83 percent from 1940 to 1951.
    As a result of the increase in the cash wages of workers and employees, the increase in the cash and in-kind income of farmers, and the reduction in the prices of mass consumer goods and other payments to residents borne by the state, the actual income of workers and employees per worker in 1951 was about 57 percent higher than in 1940, and the actual income of farmers per farmer was about 60 percent higher.
    Seven-year compulsory education is implemented everywhere in the Soviet Union, and secondary and higher education has been greatly developed. At present, the number of people studying in the Soviet Union has reached 57 million, almost 8 million more than in 1940. This year, there are 1.4 million college students studying in 887 universities and colleges. In the Soviet Union, the network of academic research institutions has increased from 1,560 in 1939 to 2,900 in early 1952.
    The Soviet people, implementing the plan of the great Stalin, are building the material and technical foundations of communism with great enthusiasm. The construction of large-scale hydropower stations on the Volga, Don, Dnieper, and Amu Darya Rivers, the excavation of the major canals of Turkmenistan, Southern Ukraine, and Northern Crimea, and the Lenin Volga-Don Canal, which opened to navigation in the summer of 1952, are embodiments of this great plan. Implementing Stalin's plan to transform nature, the Soviet people have solved tasks of great national economic significance. The industry and agriculture of the Soviet Union will receive 22.5 billion kilowatt-hours of cheap electricity from many new hydropower stations. More than 28 million hectares of land in desert and semi-desert areas will be transformed into new productive areas of the country.
    The draft directives of the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union on the Fifth Five-Year Plan unfold a magnificent prospect for the new prosperity of the socialist state. During these five years, the level of industrial production in the Soviet Union will increase by about 70 percent. The output of machine manufacturing, the foundation of technological progress in all sectors of the national economy, will roughly double. During the five years, the total energy of power stations will roughly double, and the energy of hydropower stations will triple. The production of light industry and the food industry will increase by at least 70 percent.
    In the new Five-Year Plan, science and culture will be further developed, and the material welfare of the people will be further improved. The Soviet state is embarking on the implementation of universal secondary education (ten-year education) and the implementation of universal technical education. The number of various experts trained by various higher and secondary specialized schools will increase by about 30 to 35 percent, while the training of scientific cadres and educational cadres will increase to twice as much.
    The solution of the huge tasks of the Fifth Five-Year Plan determines the further development and strengthening of the basic functions of the Soviet socialist state—the function of economic organization and the cultural and educational work of state organs.
    The Fifth Five-Year Plan once again shows the world the great vitality of socialism and the fundamental superiority of the socialist economic system over the capitalist economic system. The peaceful development of the Soviet economy stipulated in the Fifth Five-Year Plan is in stark contrast to the economy of capitalist countries, which are militarizing their national economies, allowing capitalists to seize huge profits, while making the working people even poorer.
    The new Five-Year Plan will further strengthen the strength of the camp of peace, democracy, and socialism in the Soviet Union and the world. The new upsurge of the Soviet national economy will promote the successful progress of the peoples of Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Albania, and the Mongolian People's Republic towards socialism. In the Soviet Union, all the achievements of communist construction are also inspiring the tens of millions of Chinese people who have created the People's Republic and the working people of the German Democratic Republic, who are marching hand in hand with progressive humanity under the banner of peace, democracy, and socialism.
    The Soviet state, as a powerful tool for building communism, vigilantly defends the peaceful and creative labor of the Soviet people. The peace-loving policy of the Soviet government fully demonstrates the will of all nationalities of the Soviet Union, and it is in line with the fundamental interests of the working people of the world. This peace policy is based on the recognition that socialism and capitalism—the two systems—can coexist peacefully. Constantly exposing the conspiracies of the instigators of a new world war, the Soviet Union invariably defends the cause of peace and the cause of economic and cultural cooperation among all nations. The friendly cooperation established between the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries has laid the foundation for a new type of international relations based on the principles of proletarian internationalism, equality, and brotherly mutual assistance among all nations in the common struggle for socialism.
    The Soviet Union is the leading force in the camp of peace, democracy, and socialism. The Soviet state uses all its great international prestige to consolidate the peace and security of all nations, while constantly caring for the consolidation of its own defense forces. The Soviet state and its armed forces are a powerful factor in deterring imperialist aggressors. The Soviet people sacredly carry out the instructions of the great Stalin: "The victorious revolution should not weaken, but on the contrary, should consolidate and fully strengthen its state, state organs, intelligence organs, and army, if this country does not want to be defeated by capitalist encirclement" (Stalin's "Marxism and Problems of Linguistics").
    The Soviet people are calmly and confidently looking to the future. Comrade Malenkov's remarkable words have resonated throughout the world, he said: "The Soviet Union is not intimidated by the threats of war-mongers. Our people have experience in fighting aggressors, and they are not novices in striking aggressors. As early as the time of the civil war, when the Soviet state was still young and relatively weak, our people dealt a heavy blow to the aggressors, and they also struck the aggressors during the Second World War. If the aggressors dare to attack our motherland in the future, our people will also give them a blow."
    The Soviet socialist state, under the leadership of the Lenin-Stalin Party, has achieved victories of world historical significance in communist construction. It has shown the working people of capitalist countries how great the power of a people is who have broken free from the shackles of capitalist exploitation and taken their destiny into their own hands. The working people of various people's democratic countries are enriching their own experience in the struggle for socialism with the great experience of the Soviet Union.
    The achievements of the powerful state of the working people—the Soviet Union—are inspiring the people of the world to fight for the final victory of the forces of peace, democracy, and socialism.

    苏联—强大的社会主义国家
    苏联哲学博士  维·尼果拉叶夫
    苏联人民和全世界劳动人民都隆重地来庆祝伟大十月社会主义革命三十五周年这个最光辉的节日。他们满怀着自豪来回想一九一七年十一月七日这个具有历史意义的日子，那时由列宁—斯大林党领导的俄国工人和农民推翻了地主和资本家的政权，从而在世界上创立了第一个苏维埃社会主义国家。如果说在从前所有的社会内，国家曾是剥削阶级镇压人民群众的机器的话，那末，由于社会主义革命的结果，在历史上第一次把政权转到人民的手中，这个政权已成为使人民群众摆脱剥削、压迫、贫困、愚昧的工具，成为建设崭新的、社会主义生活的工具。苏维埃社会主义国家就是为了建成共产主义和保卫祖国免遭外寇侵犯而掌握在工人和农民手中的主要工具。
    苏维埃社会主义国家自其诞生的头一天起，就坚持不懈地从事保卫全世界和平的斗争。列宁、斯大林的和平法令：立刻开始正义的、民主的和平——不兼并、不赔款的和平，曾是苏维埃政权第一批法令之一。
    在苏维埃国家存在的三十五年的全部时期内，苏联为争取各族人民间的和平与合作所进行的始终一贯的不知疲倦的斗争，曾向全人类表明：苏联就是全世界和平的强大而不可摧毁的堡垒。
    三十多年以来，苏维埃国家所实行的真诚而公开的爱好和平的对外政策，反映着全体苏联人民的切身利益。这个政策博得了全体进步人类的深切同情和公认。
    苏维埃国家是无产阶级专政的国家，是崭新的、最高的国家形式，与资产阶级国家有根本上的不同。创立了苏维埃国家的十月社会主义革命，破天荒第一次给全世界表明了劳动群众建立没有资产阶级和地主并且反对资产阶级和地主的社会和国家的生活的能力。苏联人民在起初摧毁了剥削阶级的势力，而随后并消灭了这个阶级。这样看来，自从发生了社会阶级的全部世界历史中，人剥削人的现象和寄生虫及人民的压迫者靠着人民的劳动而生活的那种极不公正的制度是第一次被铲除和消灭了。如果说，在先前时期，劳动人民只不过享受了由他们的劳动所创建的财富的小部分，而这些财富的巨大部分都落在剥削者的手中的话，那末，苏联人民遵循列宁、斯大林关于社会主义的伟大思想，能够创建了这样的社会，在这个社会内，由人的劳动所创造的所有物质福利和文化珍品都在使所有劳动人民获得利益，都在使全体社会主义社会获得利益。在苏维埃国家制度的条件下，开辟了生产力迅速增长的新源泉，开辟了发展文化和提高人民物质福利的新源泉。
    马克思列宁主义教导说，历史是由人民创造的。由列宁、斯大林的天才所创建的多民族的苏维埃社会主义国家，是在人类史上发挥群众的能力、主动精神和创造才能为共产主义而斗争的第一个国家。列宁、斯大林民族政策的实行，使居住在俄国的一切民族得以建立不可动摇的友好合作。对所有其他民族在社会主义建设上表现了大公无私的兄弟帮助的俄罗斯人民，在苏联所有民族之间，是领导的力量。
    多民族的苏联——是自由与平等的各民族的伟大友好的联盟。苏维埃国家保障了消灭苏联各族人民政治的、经济的和文化的不平等现象。从前落后的各族人民，在短暂时期内已在经济发展方面，同样也在民族形式和社会主义内容的文化方面，都达到了先进民族的水平。
    在苏联，苏维埃社会空前未有的道德和政治的统一，以及各族人民的友谊形成并巩固起来了，蓬勃的苏维埃爱国主义繁荣起来了。所有这些已成为社会主义社会的强大动力。苏维埃国家是世界上最民主的国家。它不仅是宣布，而且完全保障了实现这些民主权利和公民自由：劳动权、受教育权、休息权、年老保证权和出版、集会、结社的自由以及男女平权——不问其民族或种族。在苏联，人民和国家的统一，鲜明地表现在社会主义竞赛的广大发展上，表现在千百万苏联人的斯塔哈诺夫式的劳动中，表现在选举苏维埃政权机关时全民一致拥护党与非党联盟上。劳动人民为使苏维埃社会加速走向共产主义所用以克服自己工作当中一切缺点的批评与自我批评的强大展开，表示着人民和国家的血肉相关的联系。
    共产党——苏联人民底先进部队，是苏维埃国家的领导和主导力量。由马克思列宁主义伟大学说所武装的列宁—斯大林党对苏维埃社会实行着政治领导，它把苏联人民建设性的劳动指向于伟大目标——共产主义，它用苏维埃爱国主义的精神、无产阶级国际主义的精神和对自己社会主义祖国忠忱的精神，来教育劳动人民。共产党的政策是苏维埃制度生命攸关的基础。它表现着劳动人民的根本利益，并完全符合于人类进步发展的利益。列宁—斯大林党，由于奋不顾身地为人民服务而获得了人民无限的信任和爱戴。
    苏维埃国家实现着共产党的政策，已获得了具有全世界历史意义的胜利。它倚靠工人阶级和劳动农民的联盟，打破了被推翻了的剥削阶级的反抗，实现了社会主义的国家工业化和农业集体化，从而保证了在很短的历史时期内，在苏联建成了社会主义社会。
    在几个斯大林五年计划年代里，苏联由落后的农业国家变成了有强大的工业和集体农庄的强国。苏联人民的福利及其社会主义文化的水平，不可估量地增长了。社会主义国家不知恐慌、失业为何物。它的国民经济与文化正沿着不断提高和繁荣的道路发展着。
    苏维埃社会主义国家与剥削阶级国家所不同的最重要特点，就在于它把国家所有经济与文化生活直接地组织起来。苏联的经济生活，受国家所订国民经济计划之决定及指导，“以期增进社会财富，一贯提高劳动民众之物质及文化水准，巩固苏联之独立并加强其国防能力。”（“苏联宪法”）。
    在伟大的卫国战争期间，特别显明地表现了苏维埃国家的强大力量。在伟大斯大林的领导之下，苏联粉碎了希特勒德国和帝国主义日本。苏联人民实行自己的解放使命，把世界各族人民从法西斯奴役中拯救出来。
    战争表明了，苏维埃社会制度和国家制度是比任何其他非苏维埃的社会制度和国家制度都好的社会组织形式。苏联在战争完结时，是更加坚固、更加强大了。
    在伟大卫国战争胜利完成以后，苏维埃国家转向了和平的创造性劳动。由共产党领导的苏维埃社会主义国家，把人民的力量指向于完成战后斯大林五年计划，指向于完成由社会主义渐次过渡到共产主义的任务。
    马林科夫同志在苏联共产党第十九次代表大会上所作的联共中央委员会的报告中，曾引证了说明苏联人民在恢复和发展苏联国民经济中的巨大成就的动人的数字。
    苏联人民在由一九四六年到一九五一年这个期间，提前完成了第四个（战后的）五年计划，恢复、新建和开工了约七千个国营大工业企业。在一九五一年工业总产量为战前一九四○年水平的两倍多。由生产资料制造的工业产品增加到二·四倍。劳动生产率增加了百分之五十。由头等机器装备起来的社会主义农业，在战后粮食的收获量是逐年地增加了，而在一九五二年，粮食的总收获量已达到八十亿普特。苏联的国民收入，由一九四○年到一九五一年，已增加了百分之八十三。
    由于工人和职员的现金工资增长，农民现金和实物收入的增加以及由于大众必需品价格的降低和由国家负担的居民其他支付的增长的结果，工人和职员的实际收入，按一个工人来计算，在一九五一年已比一九四○年约多出百分之五十七，而农民的实际收入，按每个农民来计算，约多出百分之六十。
    在苏联国内，到处实施着七年制义务教育，中等和高等教育已得到巨大发展。现在在苏联国内，学习的人数已达到五千七百万人，比一九四○年几乎多出八百万人。今年在八百八十七个高等学校中，有一百四十万大学生在学习着。在苏联国内，学术研究机关网从一九三九年到一九五二年初已由一千五百六十处增加到两千九百处。
    苏联人民实现着伟大斯大林的计划，正以热火朝天的情绪来建立共产主义底物质技术基础。在伏尔加河、顿河、第聂伯河、阿姆·达里亚河上宏大水电站的建设，土库曼、南乌克兰、北克里米亚各大运河的开凿和在一九五二年夏已通航的列宁伏尔加—顿河运河就是这个伟大计划的体现。实现着斯大林改造自然计划，苏联人已解决了具有重大国民经济意义的任务。苏联的工农业将由许多新的水电站得到二百二十五亿瓩时的廉价电力。在沙漠和半沙漠地带上将有二千八百多万公顷土地变成国家新的丰产地区。
    苏联共产党第十九次代表大会关于第五个五年计划的指示草案展开了社会主义国家新繁荣的宏伟远景。在这五年期间，苏联的工业生产水平提高约百分之七十。国民经济一切部门技术进步的基础——机器制造的产量约增为两倍。在五年期间，电力站的整个能量约增为两倍，水电站的能量增为三倍。轻工业和食品工业的生产量至少增加百分之七十。
    在新的五年计划中，科学与文化将得到进一步的发展，人民的物质福利将更加提高起来。苏维埃国家，在国内正着手实行普及中等教育（十年制教育）和实施普及技术教育。将由各种高等和中等专门学校多培养出各种专家约百分之三十至三十五，而对于科学干部和教育干部的培养则将增加至两倍。
    第五个五年计划巨大任务的解决，决定着苏维埃社会主义国家的基本职能——经济组织的职能和国家机关文化教育工作的进一步发展与加强。
    第五个五年计划又一次向全世界表明了社会主义的伟大的活力，表明了社会主义经济制度较之资本主义经济制度具有根本的优越性。第五个五年计划所规定的苏联经济的和平发展，与资本主义国家的经济恰恰相反，那些国家正在使国民经济军国主义化，使资本家攫取巨额利润，同时使劳动人民更加贫困。
    新的五年计划将使苏联和全世界的和平、民主与社会主义阵营的实力进一步加强。苏联国民经济的新高涨将促进波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、匈牙利、罗马尼亚、保加利亚、阿尔巴尼亚、蒙古人民共和国各国人民顺利地向社会主义进展。在苏联，共产主义建设的一切成就，也在鼓舞着已创建了人民共和国的千千万万的中国人民和在和平、民主与社会主义旗帜下和进步人类携手前进着的德意志民主共和国的劳动人民。
    作为建设共产主义强大工具的苏维埃国家，警惕地在保卫苏联人的和平创造性劳动。苏联政府的爱好和平政策把苏联各族人民的意志完全显示出来，它是符合于全世界劳动人民根本利益的。这个和平政策乃是以承认社会主义与资本主义——两个制度可能和平共存为出发点的。不断地揭露着新的世界战争挑拨者们的阴谋诡计，苏联始终不变地保卫着和平事业和各族人民之间的经济与文化合作的事业。苏联与人民民主国家之间建立了的友好合作关系，奠定了基于无产阶级国际主义、平等和在为社会主义共同斗争中各族人民间兄弟互助诸原则上的社会主义的新型的国际关系底基础。
    苏联是和平、民主与社会主义阵营底主导力量。苏维埃国家运用着自己巨大国际威信的全副力量来巩固各族人民的和平与安全，同时不断地关怀巩固自己的国防力量。苏维埃国家及其武装力量就是抑制帝国主义侵略者的强大因素。苏联人民神圣地执行着伟大的斯大林的指示：“革命胜利了的国家不仅不应当削弱，反而应当巩固和全力加强自己的国家、国家机关、侦察机关和军队，如果这个国家不愿意被资本主义包围所击溃的话”（斯大林著“马克思主义与语言学问题”）。
    苏联人民沉着冷静地、信心百倍地注视着未来。马林科夫同志所说的卓绝的话语已响彻了全世界，他说：“苏联并没有为战争贩子的威胁所吓倒。我们的人民有着与侵略者进行斗争的经验，在打击侵略者方面，他们并不是生手。早在内战时期，当苏维埃国家还很年轻、力量还比较弱的时候，我们的人民就曾给侵略者以痛击，在第二次世界大战的时候，他们也打击了侵略者，假如侵略者将来胆敢进攻我们的祖国，我们的人民也将给他们以打击。”
    苏维埃社会主义国家，在列宁—斯大林党底领导之下，已在共产主义建设中获得了具有世界历史意义底胜利。它向资本主义国家的劳动人民表明：挣脱了资本主义剥削羁绊而把自己命运掌握在自己手中的人民，他的力量是怎样的伟大。各人民民主国家的劳动人民正以苏联的伟大经验来丰富自己为社会主义而斗争的经验。
    强大的劳动人民的国家——苏联的成就在鼓舞着全世界人民来为和平、民主与社会主义力量的最终胜利而斗争。
