The Soviet people, who cherish love for their great neighbor, recently celebrated the third anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. They regard this anniversary as a joyous festival and a symbol of the multifaceted victory of the great fraternal country.

We Soviets express great joy at the truly rapid pace at which your great, liberated country is solving the enormous tasks it faces. We cannot but express our pleasure at the broad, revolutionary, and popular character that also characterizes the new Chinese cultural construction, especially in the field of fine arts. At every Chinese art exhibition held in the Soviet Union, Soviet artists and broad Soviet public opinion are amazed not only by the high level of artistic tradition—the experience of centuries, even dozens of centuries, contained in Chinese art—but also by the unstoppable and growing social purpose of the new Chinese art. This new art has increasingly become a powerful factor in the revolutionary education of the people. This powerful creative torrent is constantly attracting and, often for the first time, awakening tens or even hundreds of talented new and old artists to create.

The Chinese people are creating new art, and they are creating it on an unprecedentedly broad popular basis.

In May 1942, Comrade Mao Zedong delivered a speech at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art. He said that China's new literature and art should serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and that the theme of literature and art should be the people. Comrade Mao Zedong's speech became a historical milestone in the development of Chinese art, defining the direction of literary and artistic creation.

The most significant Chinese New Year picture exhibition recently held in Moscow aroused enthusiastic comments from Muscovites who love this art. The exhibition proves the high artistic level of this most unique creation, in which one can see true masterpieces. This art is an inseparable part of the Chinese people's struggle and construction. The themes of these New Year pictures clearly illustrate to us Soviets the thoughts and feelings of the Chinese people now. These widely used works of Chinese artists kindly and vividly illustrate to us how much the Chinese people love and are loyal to their wise leader, Mao Zedong. In these paintings, Soviet audiences saw Comrade Mao Zedong with Comrade Stalin in the halls of the Kremlin, on the podium of the 30th anniversary celebration of the Chinese Communist Party, among the young pioneers, and among the peasants eagerly listening to his every word (painting by Gu Yuan). In a comprehensive work, he symbolizes the fraternal unity of all nationalities of China among the people (a magnificent work of small composition by painters Feng Zhen, Li Qi, and Ye Qianyu).

The Chinese painters' folk paintings also show us how profound the changes have been in all aspects of Chinese life. The painters of New China are filled with such deep patriotic feelings that every page of their paintings has become a song praising the new face of the motherland, a sincere call to encourage people to unite more closely in labor and struggle (works by painters Jin Lang, Zhou Juejun, Zhang Huaijiang, and Cao Siming depicting land reform, new families, labor, and large construction projects).

The fighting friendship between the Chinese and Korean people and their common heroic struggle against the aggressors are very vividly reflected in the art works of New China. Among these outstanding portrayals of the struggle of the Chinese and Korean peoples, how many creative geniuses there are!
(Such as painter A Lao's "Victory Celebration of Chinese and Korean Troops on the Front Line" and many other works).

The will of the great people for labor and peace is vividly reflected in the works of Chinese painters. Men, women, old and young sign the Stockholm Appeal, showing their will for peaceful labor.

Pictures depicting the fraternal friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people left a very deep impression on Soviet audiences. Audiences lingered for a long time beside the painting "Learning from the Soviet Elder Brother" by painter Wu Dezhu. The painter depicted with extremely cordial feelings the scene of Soviet experts passing on their experience to Chinese comrades in the factory. Here one cannot help but recall the words of Comrade Liu Shaoqi in the congratulatory message from the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party to the 19th Congress of the CPSU: "All progressive causes in the world are inseparable from the existence and development of the Soviet Union... The oppressed nations of the East, who have been enslaved by imperialism for a long time, have seen the achievements of Soviet construction and the Soviet Union's efforts for world peace, and have thus increased their courage in the national liberation movement a hundredfold."

In the works of Chinese painters—the experienced masters of the older generation and those who joined the fighting ranks in the recent years of heroic struggle—there are many kinds, illustrating that most of these lithographs have high artistic value. This is the artist's observation of life (in their own lives, they excel at discerning the characteristic actions of people) and the talent for composition (even in the most elaborate, seemingly embellished connections of images, clothing, groups, and environment, it retains the living naturalness of the picture).

All these creations are permeated with the optimism of a powerful people who have found the correct historical path.

The art of the Chinese people increasingly intensifies the feeling of friendship in the hearts of Soviet artists and all Soviet people towards the great people, our allies and brothers in the struggle to defend world peace.

The image of Chinese art, whether in the overall conception or in the smallest details, is very specific. The feeling that the audience gets from this art is particularly strong. The words in the congratulatory message of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party to the 19th Congress of the CPSU clearly explain the reason for the victory of Chinese art: "The victory of the Chinese revolution and the great achievements of the construction work in the three years since the founding of the People's Republic of China prove that: according to the specific conditions of each country, the correct application of the teachings of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, and the correct application of the experience of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union on revolution and construction, will be invincible."

    对自己的伟大邻邦怀着热爱心情的苏联人民，不久之前庆祝过中华人民共和国成立三周年纪念日，他们把这个纪念日看作愉快的节日、看作伟大兄弟国家的多方面胜利的标志。
    我们苏联人对于你们伟大的、解放了的国家在解决自己所面临的巨大任务时的那种真正突击的速度，表示极大的喜悦。对于那种也为新中国文化建设，尤其是美术方面的建设所特具的广泛的革命建设的人民性，我们不能不表示高兴。在苏联每次举行的中国艺术展览会上，不仅艺术传统的高度水平——中国美术中所包含的几世纪甚至几十世纪的经验，使苏联艺术家和广大的苏联舆论界感到惊奇，而且，中国新艺术的不可遏止的日益加强的社会目的性也是令人惊奇的。这种新艺术现在已日益成为对人民进行革命教育的强大因素。这个强大的创作巨流不断地吸引着，并且往往首先是唤醒着成十个乃至数百个有天才的新、老艺术家来进行创作。
    中国人民正在创造新的艺术，而且是在前所未有的广泛的人民基础上创造着新的艺术。
    一九四二年五月，毛泽东同志在延安文艺座谈会上发表过一篇谈话。他说，中国新文艺应当为工农兵服务，而文艺的主题应当是人民。毛泽东同志的这篇谈话成了中国艺术发展的历史里程碑，它规定了文学艺术的创作方向。
    莫斯科最近举行最有意义的中国年画展览会，这个展览会引起了爱好这种艺术的莫斯科人的很热烈的评论。展览会证明这一最独特的创作的高度艺术水平，这里面可以看到真正的杰作。这种艺术是中国人民斗争和建设的不可分的一部分。这种年画的题材，很明白地向我们苏联人说明了中国人民现在的思想感情是什么。这些应用极广的中国艺术家的作品，很亲切地和很生动地向我们说明了中国人民对他们的英明领袖毛泽东是如何的爱戴和忠诚。在这些画里，苏联观众看到毛泽东同志在克里姆林宫的大厅里和斯大林同志在一起，看到他在中国共产党三十周年庆祝大会的主席台上，看到他在少年儿童队员中间，他在那热望倾听到他每一句话的农民中间（画家古元画），而在一幅综合的作品里，他在人群中间象征着中国各民族的兄弟团结（画家冯真、李琦以及叶浅予画的构图不大的壮丽的作品）。
    中国画家的民间画也向我们表明：中国生活的一切方面已经起了如何深刻的变革了。新中国的画家怀着这样深刻的爱国主义的感情，以致他们的每一页画都成了歌颂祖国新面目的歌曲，成了鼓舞人们在劳动和斗争中更加团结的恳切的号召（画家金浪、周觉钧、张怀江和曹思明等描绘土地改革、新家庭、劳动、大建筑工程等的作品）。
    在新中国的艺术作品里非常生动地反映出来的，还有中国人民和朝鲜人民的战斗友谊，以及他们对于侵略者的共同的英勇斗争。在这些卓越地表达出中朝人民斗争的大群人物中，有多少创作天才啊
    （如画家阿老的“中朝部队前线胜利联欢”及其他许多作品）。
    在中国画家的作品里，生动地反映出来的，还有伟大人民对于劳动与和平的意志。男女老幼在斯德哥尔摩宣言上签名，表现出他们对于和平劳动的意志。
    描绘中苏两国人民兄弟友谊的图画，给苏联观众留下极深刻的印象。观众在画家武德祖的“向苏联老大哥学习”这一幅画旁边停留了很久。画家用极亲切的感情描绘出苏联专家在工厂里把自己的经验传授给中国同志的情形。这里不由地令人想起刘少奇同志在联共第十九次代表大会上所宣读的中国共产党中央委员会祝词里的几句话：“世界上一切进步事业都是和苏联的存在与发展分不开的……。在帝国主义长期奴役下的东方被压迫民族，看见苏联建设的成就，苏联为世界和平的努力，因而百倍地加强了自己在民族解放运动中的勇气。”
    在中国画家——老的一代的有经验的大师们和在最近英勇斗争年代里加入战斗队伍的人们——的作品里面，有很多种类，说明这大部分石印画片具有高度的艺术价值。这就是艺术家的生活观察力（他们在自己的生活中卓越地窥出人们可作为特征的动作）和构图机敏的才能（甚至在最精巧的、似乎是修饰过了的形象、衣服、集团、环境的联系中，它也保有画面的活的自然性）。
    所有这些创作都渗透着那找到了正确历史道路的强大人民的乐观主义。
    中国人民的艺术在苏联艺术家和全体苏联人民的心坎里愈加强烈地燃起了对于伟大人民、对于在保卫世界和平斗争中的我们的盟友、兄弟的友谊的感情。
    中国艺术的形象无论在整个的构思上或最小的细节上，都是十分具体的。观众从这种艺术中所得到的感觉是特别强烈的。中国共产党中央委员会对联共第十九次代表大会的祝词中的几句话，明白地说明了中国艺术的胜利的原因：“中国革命的胜利以及中华人民共和国成立以后三年来的建设事业的巨大成就证明了：根据各个国家的具体情况，正确地运用马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的学说，正确地运用苏联共产党关于革命与建设的经验，是无往而不胜利的。”
