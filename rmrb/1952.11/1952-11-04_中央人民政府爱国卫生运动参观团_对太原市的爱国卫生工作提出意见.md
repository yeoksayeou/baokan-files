    The Patriotic Health Campaign Visiting Group organized by the Central People's Government recently inspected the achievements of the patriotic health work of seventeen units, including provincial-level organizations and organs, factories, mines, enterprises, and streets in Taiyuan City, Shanxi Province. On the morning of October 9th, the Shanxi Provincial People's Government held a symposium attended by members of the Central People's Government Patriotic Health Campaign Visiting Group, as well as heads of provincial and municipal organizations and responsible persons from relevant units, totaling more than seventy people. At the meeting, He Dezhao of the visiting group said: The patriotic health campaign in Taiyuan City has already been launched, and leaders at all levels have attached importance to it, resulting in great achievements. In terms of environmental sanitation, the achievements of the citizens are the most outstanding, with Xinmin Second Street being a model sanitation street, and Douya Lane being very clean. Among the organs and factories, the radio station is the best, followed by the Taiyuan Municipal People's Government, and the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant and the Chemical Plant are not bad. However, the environmental sanitation of some organs, factories, and enterprises is still very poor, the most typical being the Taiyuan Railway Hospital and the Taiyuan Department Store Food Department's manufacturing plant. Since the launch of the patriotic health campaign, the Taiyuan Railway Hospital has not really been mobilized. From a sanitary point of view, it does not meet the minimum standards of a hospital. The reason for this is that the leadership does not attach enough importance to it, the organization of the patriotic health campaign is formalistic, and the publicity and education are insufficient. Most of the nurses and doctors do not know the meaning and content of "four cleans and five eliminations," and some do not even know what the patriotic health campaign is. The Food Department of the Department Store does not pay attention to hygiene. There are many flies in the manufacturing plant, the workers' clothes are very dirty, their fingernails are very long, they do not wear work clothes when working, and there is sugar scattered everywhere on the ground. He Dezhao also raised many opinions regarding the safety and health equipment of factories and mines and the prevention of occupational diseases for workers. He suggested that Taiyuan City: (1) The organization and leadership of the patriotic health campaign should be unified. No matter which organ, factory, mine, or military unit, it should obey the unified leadership of the health organization in the area where it is located and should not refuse health inspections on the pretext of "special circumstances." The internal health work of each organ must be led by the organ's Patriotic Health Campaign Committee and should no longer be handled concurrently by departments such as the welfare section; (2) In terms of publicity and education, in the future, emphasis should be placed on strengthening the publicity of personal hygiene, and special attention should be paid to educating cooks to pay attention to personal hygiene; (3) Strengthen the industry's health inspection organization; (4) Before and after winter, carry out mass rat-catching and fly pupae digging activities to eradicate or reduce the breeding of flies next year; (5) Strengthen the statistical reporting system; (6) Establish a regular inspection system and establish a "Patriotic Health Day," on which half a day should be spent cleaning and inspecting.
    According to the opinions of the visiting group, Lang Taonan, Director of the Taiyuan Railway Sub-bureau, made an on-the-spot self-criticism, believing that he had not done enough to supervise and inspect the health work of the railway hospital. He expressed his sincere acceptance of the opinions raised by the visiting group and resolved to correct the shortcomings. Liang Ziru, manager of the Department Store, and the负责人 responsible person of the Food Department also made on-the-spot self-criticisms, expressing their determination to correct the shortcomings in the short term.
    Finally, Wang Shiying, Deputy Chairman of the Shanxi Provincial People's Government, spoke. He welcomed the opinions put forward by the visiting group, believing that the help and guidance of the visiting group would greatly promote the patriotic health campaign in Taiyuan City and Shanxi Province. He said: Although Shanxi Province has made some achievements in health work, it is not very in-depth, especially personal hygiene, which has not received enough attention. The publicity and education for the masses is not specific enough, and the organization and system of patriotic health is not strict enough, and some are reduced to formalism. Deputy Chairman Wang Shiying announced on the spot that the manufacturing plant of the Department Store Food Department should be closed immediately and reopened after the health work is done well. He also asked the负责人 responsible persons of the Railway Sub-bureau, the Railway Hospital, and the Food Department of the Department Store to make public self-criticisms in the newspaper. Deputy Chairman Wang Shiying finally put forward specific requirements for future health work: (1) Improve and consolidate the health inspection system to make the patriotic health campaign regular and institutionalized; (2) Those who do well in health work should be commended and rewarded, and those who do not do well should be criticized and even punished; (3) Uniformly stipulate a "Patriotic Health Day" and publish it in the newspaper; (4) Carry out mass fly pupae digging activities to eradicate the breeding of flies next year; (5) Pay attention to strengthening statistical work to have a clear picture. He called on everyone to treat the patriotic health campaign as a long-term and regular work and to conduct regular inspections.

    中央人民政府爱国卫生运动参观团
    对太原市的爱国卫生工作提出意见
    中央人民政府组织的爱国卫生运动参观团，最近参观了山西省省级机关和太原市的机关、厂矿、企业、街道等十七个单位的爱国卫生工作成绩。十月九日上午山西省人民政府举行了座谈会，到会的除中央人民政府爱国卫生运动参观团人员外，还有省市各机关首长及有关各单位负责人员共七十余人。会上参观团的何德藻说：太原市的爱国卫生运动是已经开展起来了，各级领导也重视了，因而做出了很大的成绩。在环境卫生方面，以市民的成绩为最突出，新民二条真算个卫生模范街，豆芽巷也很整洁。在机关和厂矿方面以广播电台为最好，其次则为太原市人民政府，太原钢铁厂和化学厂都不坏。但是有些机关、工厂、企业的环境卫生还是很不好的，最典型的要算太原铁路医院和太原百货公司食品部的制造厂。太原铁路医院自开展爱国卫生运动以来，一直没有真正动起来，从卫生条件来看，它不够一个医院的起码水平。其所以如此，乃因领导重视不够，爱国卫生运动的组织是形式主义的，宣传教育很不够，多数的护士、大夫都不知道“四净五灭”的意义和内容，甚至不知道爱国卫生运动是什么。百货公司的食品部不注意卫生，制造厂内的苍蝇很多，工人们的衣服很脏，指甲很长，工作时也不穿工作服，脚底下到处是撒的糖。关于厂矿安全卫生设备、工人职业病的预防等方面，何德藻也提了不少的意见。他建议太原市：（一）在爱国卫生运动的组织领导方面要统一起来，无论任何机关、厂矿、部队都应服从驻在地区卫生组织的统一领导，不得藉口“特殊”而拒绝卫生检查。各机关内部的卫生工作，都必须由该机关爱国卫生运动委员会领导，不应再由福利科等部门兼办；（二）在宣传教育方面，今后应着重加强个人卫生的宣传，特别要注意教育炊事员注意个人卫生；（三）加强行业的卫生检查组织；（四）冬季前后，开展群众性的捕鼠和挖蝇蛹工作，后者是为了根绝或减少明年苍蝇的孳生；（五）加强统计报告制度；（六）建立经常检查制度，建立“爱国卫生日”，在这一天应以半天的时间进行打扫和检查。
    根据参观团的意见，太原铁路分局局长郎焘南当场作了检讨，认为自己对铁路医院卫生工作的督促检查很不够，对参观团所提的意见表示诚恳接受，决心改正缺点。百货公司经理梁子儒和食品部的负责人等也都当场作了检讨，表示决心在短期内改正缺点。
    最后由山西省人民政府王世英副主席发言。他对参观团提出的意见表示欢迎，认为参观团的帮助和指导，将大大推动太原市区及山西全省的爱国卫生运动。他说：山西省的卫生工作虽然获得了一些成绩，但它是很不深入的，特别是个人卫生，更是注意不够。对群众的宣传教育不够具体，爱国卫生的组织和制度也不够严密，有的流于形式主义。王世英副主席当场宣布百货公司食品部制造厂要立即停业，待卫生工作搞好后再开业。并让铁路分局及铁路医院和百货公司食品部的负责人在报纸上公开检讨。王世英副主席最后提出今后卫生工作中的具体要求：（一）健全和巩固卫生检查制度，使爱国卫生运动经常化、制度化；（二）卫生工作做得好的要予以表扬奖励，做得不好的要给以批评以至处分；（三）统一规定“爱国卫生日”，在报纸上公布；
    （四）开展群众性的挖蝇蛹运动，以根绝明年蝇子的孳生；（五）注意加强统计工作，做到心中有数。他号召大家把爱国卫生运动当作一个长期的、经常性的工作，要经常进行检查。
