Sum up the Main Advanced Experiences in Basic Construction Work
Li Kedong, Director of the North China Construction Trade Union

After the North China Region held a conference on exchanging advanced experiences in the construction industry in July, the entire region launched a campaign to promote advanced experiences and achieved great results. Facts have proved that this work is a key link in shortening construction periods, reducing costs, and completing planned tasks.

Next year's basic construction plan will be much larger than this year's. If we do not treat the promotion of advanced experiences that have a decisive effect as an important task, thereby tapping the potential of employees, it will be impossible to undertake next year's key construction tasks. Therefore, the task of carefully summarizing the various important advanced experiences in the construction industry is a very important task at present.

What are the decisive advanced experiences in basic construction? After half a year of exploration, the most decisive experience in the construction industry at present lies in applying the method of "organizing rhythmic production according to instruction charts" to the construction management of basic construction, and adopting advanced operation methods of flow, parallel, and cycle. It has been proven in three pilot construction sites in Beijing that it is an advanced experience for scientifically implementing planned management; it is the best method to eliminate the current phenomena of poor planning, inflexible supply, and wasted manpower in construction, and to accelerate project progress and reduce costs; it is also a decisive experience to ensure the realization of "fast, good, and economical" at present. It can shorten the entire construction period by one to two times or more. For example, Beijing's ○二○ construction site used this advanced experience, and 1,600 workers built twelve two-story buildings, totaling 17,000 square meters, in 52 days. If some wasteful phenomena in construction are reduced, the entire construction period can be greatly shortened. On the contrary, a two-story building in Tianjin, with the same structure as the former, but only over 3,000 square meters, took more than 300 workers 240 construction days (actually one year) to complete. This is a clear contrast between different methods and different effects.

"Organizing rhythmic production according to instruction charts" is a comprehensive management method. It is not only not contradictory to the advanced experiences of various trades and departments, but various advanced experiences can only be fully utilized and become more complete within this comprehensive management method. Therefore, all units are required to quickly and conscientiously summarize the experience of organizing rhythmic production according to instruction charts. The quality of experience summarization is the key to whether it can be universally promoted next year. In the past, many important advanced experiences have been discovered in various departments and trades, but because they have not been carefully studied and summarized in time, they cannot be promoted.

In addition, special attention should also be paid to the reform of labor organization and the advanced experience of bricklayers. The method of changing individual solo work into scientific division of labor and collective operation in labor organization reduces the non-technical labor of skilled workers, which can greatly improve production efficiency and solve the difficulty of insufficient skilled workers. However, there are many problems in the organization of professional groups and operation groups, which need to be solved quickly. Next year, brick-wood structures will still account for the vast majority of building projects. How to further study, affirm, and universally promote the operating experience of bricklayers in bricklaying, plastering, jointing, and spraying is also a very important task. For example, there are many advanced experiences in bricklaying: there are double-handed slurry squeezing, single-handed slurry squeezing, three-section bricklaying method, circular bricklaying method, etc. Recently, the Tianjin Construction Company has also created a gray shovel. However, there is still a lack of unified evaluation of these creations, and their achievements must be affirmed or their advantages must be integrated and improved. On the other hand, due to the complex shape of buildings, an operating experience or tool cannot be applied to various situations, so it is obviously wrong to attempt to subjectively require the application of an experience to various different construction works.

How can these important advanced experiences be summarized well? Half a year of promoting advanced experiences has yielded a lot of experience and lessons. Most of these advanced experiences have been appraised by the masses. In particular, the employees in the various pilot construction sites have a deeper understanding of it, which objectively provides the conditions for summarizing these experiences well. At present, it is hoped that leaders at all levels will pay attention to this work, assign cadres to form special organizations, and go deep into various pilot construction sites to hold various symposiums to carry out preliminary summary work. If it can be affirmed, it should be written into technical regulations, operating regulations, and work systems as written things to facilitate universal promotion; if it cannot be affirmed, it can be continued to study. Any experience that has already achieved success should be used as the main teaching material for winter training employees to learn technology and business, and continue to be revised. Only after extensive study, research, and revision by the majority of employees can it become a more complete and practical experience that can be easily grasped by the majority of employees. This is the most important specific preparatory work in winter training. Now that winter has arrived and the completion of work is not far away, we should quickly start this work so as not to affect the business and technical learning of cadres and workers in winter training and the universal promotion of these experiences in basic construction next year.

    把基本建设工作中的主要先进经验总结起来
    华北建筑工会主任  李克东
    华北区七月间举行了建筑业先进经验交流会议后，全区就开展了推广先进经验的工作，并取得了很大的成绩。事实证明，这一工作是缩短工期、降低成本、完成计划任务的主要环节。
    明年基本建设计划比今年要大的多，如果不把推行有决定作用的先进经验当成重要的任务，从而发挥职工潜在力量，那么是不可能担当起明年重点建设任务的。因此，认真总结建筑业中的各种重要先进经验的工作，是当前十分重要的任务。
    在基本建设中什么是有决定性的先进经验呢？经过半年的摸索，建筑业中目前最有决定意义的是在于把“按指示图表组织有节奏生产”的方法，用于基本建设中的施工管理上，并采用流水、平行、循环的先进操作方法。在北京三个试点工地中已经证明，它是科学地实行计划管理的先进经验；是消灭当前施工中计划不周、供应不灵、窝工浪费等现象，加速工程进度、降低成本的最好方法；也是当前保证实现“要快、要好、要省”的具有决定性的经验。它可使工程整个工期缩短一倍至两倍以上。如北京○二○工地运用了这一先进经验，一千六百工人在五十二天中就修起了十二幢两层的大楼，共计
    一万七千平方公尺。如果再把施工中的一些浪费现象减少，还可以大大缩短整个工期。与此相反，天津一个工地的二层楼房，结构与前者相同，仅三千多平方公尺，但三百多工人用了二百四十个施工日（实际是一年）才完成，这是不同方法不同效果的显明对照。
    “按指示图表组织有节奏生产”，是个综合性的管理方法，它与各个工种和各个部门的先进经验不但不矛盾，而且各种先进经验只有在这一综合的管理方法之中才能充分发挥作用，才愈趋于完整。因此，要求各单位迅速地认真地把按指示图表组织有节奏生产的经验总结起来。经验总结得好坏，是明年能否普遍推行的关键。过去在各部门与各工种中均发现了很多重要的先进经验，但正是由于未能及时地认真地加以研究总结，因此无法推广。
    此外，对劳动组织改革工作与瓦工的先进经验亦应特别重视。劳动组织上变个人单干为科学分工、集体操作的作法，减少了技术工人的非技术劳动，可以大大地提高生产效率，解决技术工人不足的困难。但在专业小组与操作组的组织上各有一套，存在不少问题，也需要很快地加以解决。明年建筑工程中仍是以砖木结构占绝大部分，对瓦工中的砌砖、抹灰、抅缝、喷浆等操作经验，如何进一步地予以研究、肯定、普遍推广，亦是非常重要的工作。如砌砖的先进经验很多：有双手挤浆、单手挤浆、三段砌砖法、循环砌砖法等，最近天津市建筑公司又创造了铺灰铲。但对于这一些创造，还缺乏统一的评价，必须肯定其成绩或综合其优点加以提高。另一方面，由于建筑物的造型复杂，一种操作经验或工具，不可能在各种情况下都适用，因此企图主观地要求将一种经验施之于各种不同的建筑工作，这显然也是错误的。
    怎样才能将这些关系重大的先进经验总结好呢？半年的推广先进经验工作，取得了不少的经验与教训。这些先进经验，大多已经过群众鉴定。特别是各个试点工地中的职工对它已有更深刻的认识，这就在客观上具备着总结好这些经验的条件。目前希望各级领导同志重视这个工作，抽调干部成立专门组织，有目的地深入各个试点工地召开各种座谈会，进行初步总结工作，能肯定即先写成技术规程、操作规程、工作制度等成文东西，以便于普遍推行；不能肯定的则可继续研究。凡已有成就的经验，就应作为冬训职工学习技术与业务的主要教材，并继续修正。只有经过了广大职工的学习研究修正，才可能使它成为更完整而实际可行的经验，才便于为广大职工所掌握，这是冬季训练工作中一项最主要的具体准备工作。现在冬季已到，收工已为期不远，我们应该迅速着手进行这一工作，以便不使冬训中干部与工人的业务、技术学习和明年基本建设中普遍推广这些经验的工作受到影响。
