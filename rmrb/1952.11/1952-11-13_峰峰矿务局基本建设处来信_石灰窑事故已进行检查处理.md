Letter from the Capital Construction Department of the Fengfeng Mining Bureau
The Lime Kiln Accident Has Been Inspected and Handled

Editor: The criticism of the lime kiln at the sand and gravel plant of our department's sideline industry section continuously causing gassing accidents, made by readers Wang Xuezu and Shi Shuye, is correct. We are now informing you of the inspection results and handling opinions.

Our department's capital construction tasks have been greatly increased, and we feel that lime is insufficient. In order to produce lime as soon as possible, the sand and gravel plant adopted the method of advancing all kilns simultaneously at the lime kiln north of Zhifang Village, loading the kiln while simultaneously lighting the fire. The original estimate was: these kilns are new, the kilns are damp, and the capacity is large, so it would take at least ten days for smoke to appear after the fire was lit. Therefore, the kiln could be filled before the smoke appeared. However, it was not expected that the kiln was large, the opening was large, and the ventilation was good, so the fire caught quickly, and smoke appeared five or six days after it was lit. The director of the sand and gravel plant knew about this situation but did not take effective preventive measures, which resulted in the gassing accident on September 9th. After the first accident occurred, the director of the sand and gravel plant still did not specifically study safety production measures. On September 10th, another accident occurred. Only then did the administration and the trade union study and decide to let workers go down the kiln to rest every two hours of work, and temporary workers would replace them. The next day, the director of the plant only went to the site to say something but did not specifically resolve the issue of temporary workers' wages, so this method was not actually implemented. That afternoon, another serious accident occurred in which three workers were gassed and had headaches, and worker Zhang Yongji fainted. This serious accident still did not attract the attention of the leadership. On the 12th and 13th, three workers each day were gassed and had headaches.

The occurrence of this series of accidents shows that the erroneous thinking of our department's capital construction department, section, and plant-level leaders, who simply pursue the completion of tasks and ignore worker safety, is very serious. In particular, the continuous occurrence of accidents and the failure of relevant cadres to take measures to prevent them is an intolerable error. We convened an enlarged meeting of cadres from all plants in the sideline industry section on September 16th to inspect this incident. The cadres involved in this incident all made self-criticisms, requesting the higher authorities to give them punishment, and expressing that they would work hard in the future and make amends for their mistakes.

Meng Zhaoyuan, director of the Capital Construction Department, because he demanded increased lime production, went to the lime kiln on September 1st to convene cadres such as the director of the sand and gravel plant to study tasks and formulate production plans; although he also proposed paying attention to safe production at that time, he did not pay enough attention to it in his own thinking, so he did not make specific arrangements. On September 10th, after hearing that the lime kiln at the sand and gravel plant had a gassing accident, although he instructed the chief of the sideline industry section and the chief of the personnel section to go to the lime kiln to check the cause and study prevention methods, he did not personally go to the site to study it, and he did not check after issuing instructions. It was not until September 15th that he sent someone to the lime kiln, but the accidents had occurred continuously. At that time, he truly paid attention to this issue in his thinking and ordered the immediate cessation of kiln loading, convened a worker symposium, and reviewed the shortcomings of the leadership. His erroneous thinking of ignoring worker safety and bureaucratic work style are one of the reasons for the continuous occurrence of accidents, so he has requested the higher authorities to give him punishment.

Hou Hexuan, chief of the sideline industry section, directly leads the work of the sand and gravel plant. After the accident at the lime kiln, he neither dealt with it nor reported it to the higher authorities. After receiving instructions from the department director, he still did not go to the site, but only sent a clerk to "arrange" work. Accidents occurred five times in a row, and he never went to the site to seriously study prevention methods. This shows that his bureaucratic work style is very serious, so he has requested the higher authorities to demote him.

Gao Ziliang, director of the sand and gravel plant, did not study prevention methods after the first accident occurred, nor did he report it to the higher authorities; after the second accident occurred, he still did not pay attention to the safety of workers, formally arranged work, but did not solve specific problems. After the worker Zhang Yonghong was gassed and fainted, he did not report it to the higher authorities until the next day. After receiving instructions from the section chief and the department director, he still did not earnestly implement them and continued to adhere to his errors, resulting in five consecutive accidents. This erroneous thinking of ignoring workers' lives and safety is extremely serious. He has requested the higher authorities to dismiss him.

Liu Shulin, chief of the personnel section, did not personally go to the site to carry out the task after receiving instructions from the department director, and he has requested the higher authorities to give him a criticism.

At the meeting, it was also decided to establish various safe production systems, operating procedures, and security equipment in each plant, and to conduct ideological education on safe production among the workers to prevent similar accidents from happening again.

### 峰峰矿务局基本建设处来信  石灰窑事故已进行检查处理

    峰峰矿务局基本建设处来信
    石灰窑事故已进行检查处理
    编辑同志：读者王学祖、史书业对我处副业科砂石厂石灰窑连续发生熏人事故的批评是正确的。现在我们将检查结果和处理意见告诉你们。
    我处基本建设的任务追加很多，石灰感到不够用。砂石厂为了争取早日出灰，在纸坊村北石灰窑采取了各窑同时并进，一面装窑、一面点火的办法。原来估计：这些窑是新窑，窑湿，容量大，点上火最快也得十几天才能冒烟，因而在冒火前就可以把窑装满。但没有想到：窑大、口大，通风好，火上的快，结果点上火五、六天就冒烟了。砂石厂主任知道这个情况后，没有采取有效的防止办法，因而造成了九月九日的熏人事故。第一次事故发生后，砂石厂主任仍不具体研究安全生产办法。九月十日又发生了事故。行政与工会这才研究决定让工人每工作两小时后即下窑休息一次，由临时工代替工作。第二天该厂主任只到现场说了一下，没有具体解决临时工的工资问题，因而这个办法实际上并没执行。当天下午又发生三个工人被熏头痛、工人张永纪晕倒的严重事故。这个严重事故仍未引起领导方面的注意，十二、十三两日又各有三个工人被熏得头痛。
    这一连串事故的发生，说明我们基本建设处的处、科、厂各级领导干部单纯追求完成任务而忽视工人安全的错误思想是很严重的。尤其是事故连续发生，有关干部仍不设法防止，更是不能容忍的错误行为。我们在九月十六日已召开了副业科各厂干部扩大会议，对这一事件进行了检查。与此事件有关的干部都做了检讨，要求上级给以处分，并表示今后要好好工作，戴罪立功。
    基本建设处处长孟昭远，因为要求石灰增产，在九月一日到石灰窑召集砂石厂主任等干部研究任务、制订生产计划；虽然当时也提出要注意安全生产，但自己思想上并未十分重视，因而就未作具体布置。九月十日，他听到砂石厂石灰窑发生熏人事故后，虽然指示副业科科长和人事科科长到石灰窑去检查原因，研究防止办法，但自己没亲到现场研究，发出指示后也未作检查。到九月十五日，他才派人到石灰窑，但事故已连续发生。那时，他思想上才真正重视这个问题，责令立即停止装窑，召开工人座谈会，检讨领导方面的缺点。他的忽视工人安全的错误思想和官僚主义工作作风是造成事故连续发生的原因之一，因此已要求上级给予处分。
    副业科长侯和轩直接领导砂石厂工作。石灰窑发生事故后，他既不处理，也不向上级作报告。在接到处长指示后，仍不下现场，只派一个办事员去“布置”工作。事故连续发生五次，他始终没去现场，认真研究防止办法。这说明他的官僚主义作风是很严重的，故已要求上级给以降职处分。
    砂石厂主任高子良，在第一次事故发生后不研究防止办法，也不向上级报告；第二次事故发生后，对工人安全问题仍不重视，形式主义地布置一下工作，而不解决具体问题。工人张永红熏晕事件发生后，他到第二天才向上级报告。接到科长、处长指示后，仍不认真执行，继续坚持错误，以致连续发生五次事故。这种忽视工人生命安全的错误思想是极其严重的。已要求上级给以撤职处分。
    人事科长刘树林接到处长指示后，未亲去现场执行任务，要求上级给以批评处分。
    在会上，又决定在各厂建立各种安全生产制度、操作规程和保安设备，并向工人群众进行安全生产的思想教育，以防止今后再发生类似事故。
