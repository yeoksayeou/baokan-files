    We Must Emphasize Theoretical Study for Senior Cadres

    Currently, senior cadres throughout the Party are enthusiastically studying Stalin's great work "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR," Malenkov's summary report on the work of the Central Committee of the CPSU at the 19th Congress of the CPSU, and other documents from the 19th Congress of the CPSU. At the central and central bureau levels, many examples of those good at studying and leading study have emerged. We should require all senior cadres to emulate these examples, so that our theoretical study truly achieves the purpose of improving thought and improving work, and that this theoretical study is regularized.

    Comrade Mao Zedong has always attached great importance to the theoretical study of senior cadres. In his report to the Sixth Plenary Session of the Sixth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China in 1938, he specifically called on senior cadres to strengthen their study and research of Marxist-Leninist theory. Comrade Mao Zedong said that the theory of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin "should be studied more intensively by members of the Central Committee and senior cadres in particular." He also said, "From the point of view of shouldering major leadership responsibilities, if our Party has one to two hundred comrades who have systematically rather than fragmentarily, practically rather than emptily, learned Marxism-Leninism, it will greatly increase the fighting power of our Party and accelerate our work of defeating Japanese imperialism."

    Many of our senior cadres often pay attention to improving their theoretical and political level and seize various opportunities to study Marxism-Leninism. However, many senior cadres do not pay attention to such study. Some senior cadres even study less and study worse than ordinary cadres. There are also a few senior cadres who are so busy with affairs all day long that they do not engage in theoretical study at all. This situation has clearly reached a point where it must be ended. This is not only because certain objective conditions that hinder regular study have improved and will continue to improve, but mainly because we are facing extremely arduous and complex economic construction tasks. "If a workman wishes to do his job well, he must first sharpen his tools." That is to say, in order to accomplish our great tasks, we must strive to study theory, improve our ideological level, master the laws of motion of objective things, and thus gain the ability to foresee; otherwise, we will be short-sighted, or blindly advance, or be complacent and conservative, we will cause losses to our work, and there will be a danger that we will not be able to complete the national tasks.

    In order to strengthen the theoretical study of senior cadres, it is certainly necessary to rely on the conscious efforts of each comrade, but it is also necessary to establish a certain system within each organization and implement necessary assistance and supervision. In this regard, the theoretical study of senior cadres in the Industrial Department of the Northeast People's Government is a good example. (See page 3 of today's newspaper) Their study has been able to continue for nearly three years, and has played a very significant role in improving cadres and improving work. Today's newspaper introduces their experience, because this experience is beneficial to the current study of senior cadres throughout the Party, and can illustrate the following four issues:

    First, the role of theoretical study in improving work is obvious and enormous. What achievements has the theoretical study of senior cadres in the Industrial Department of the Northeast People's Government achieved? The main ones are: overcoming the dangerous tendency of some cadres to engage solely in business and ignore politics, expanding and improving the political vision of cadres; overcoming the work style of localism and bureaucracy of some cadres, and improving their leadership methods. The political enthusiasm of cadres has been improved, the detours in work have been reduced, and the steps of superiors and subordinates have been consistent. Their theoretical study, especially the study of Soviet socialist economic construction theory, is directly related to the leadership work of restoring and developing industrial production in the Northeast, and has played a great inspirational role. Almost all senior cadres who participated in the study believe that the achievements of their work are inseparable from the study of basic theory. The practice of the leading comrades of the Industrial Department of the Northeast People's Government relying on grasping theoretical study to improve work and cadre level is completely correct and should be promoted.

    Second, the key to whether senior cadres' theoretical study can be sustained lies in the understanding and determination of the main responsible cadres. If the main responsible cadres earnestly attach importance to the theoretical study of leading cadres, regard it as an important part of their own leadership work, and take the lead in studying and adhering to the study system, the study can be sustained. If the leading cadres do not pay attention, do not support, do not adhere to the study system, and do not actively study themselves, the study will be difficult to sustain. Naturally, senior cadres are busy with work and have little time, which is a difficulty. However, the leading comrades of the Industrial Department of the Northeast People's Government made up their minds and made appropriate arrangements for their work, and this difficulty was overcome. After the study achieved results, everyone believed that study was an indispensable item for doing a good job. The Industrial Department is an extremely tense and busy organization, and the past two or three years have been two or three years when the restoration work and various mass movements were extremely urgent. They have still been able to persist in studying all along and have never interrupted it. So, why can't other organizations spare time to study in the future when their work is increasingly on the right track? In addition, leading comrades taking the lead in serious study can not only improve the enthusiasm of others to study, but also, generally speaking, because they have a higher level of ideological theory and more practical experience, they are clearer about the situation and problems in work and business, so they can make the theoretical study and practical work more closely combined, improve the ideological level of study, and help everyone to study better.

    Third, the theoretical study of senior cadres must adhere to the close combination of theory and practice. Our theoretical study has always been for the needs of the actual revolution and construction cause. Senior cadres who bear heavy responsibilities for practical work especially require that theoretical study can directly help work. Of course, senior cadres who bear leadership responsibilities cannot only care about a part of things and temporary things within the scope of their own business work. In order to improve their work level, generally speaking, what senior cadres need most is to learn work methods and leadership methods through the theoretical study of Marxism-Leninism, learn how to grasp the objective laws of various things encountered in work, and learn to grasp the relationship between one work and other surrounding works. At the same time, it is also necessary for senior cadres working in various departments to first focus on studying theoretical knowledge directly related to their work according to the needs of business work. For example, senior cadres in the Industrial Department and other financial and economic organizations focus on studying Lenin and Stalin's theoretical works on socialist economic construction; senior cadres in political and legal departments or cultural and educational departments focus on studying the theoretical works of Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin, and Comrade Mao Zedong on political law and culture and education. The experience of the Northeast Industrial Department and other experiences have proved that as long as we strive to "apply what we have learned," the theoretical study of Marxism-Leninism among senior cadres can be carried out very well; conversely, if we ignore the needs of actual work, we will often give up halfway. Naturally, from a long-term perspective, the theoretical study of senior cadres must be increasingly systematic, and many basic works of Marxist-Leninist theory must be listed as required reading. But this is to be done gradually.

    Fourth, the learning method of senior cadres mainly relies on individual self-study, but appropriate seminars and discussions must be organized, and supervision and inspection must be strengthened. Appropriate seminars and discussions can play a role in inspiring thought and strengthening the effect of study, and should not be ignored. Due to the current lack of instructors (or tutors) to help senior cadres study theory, and the work of newspapers and magazines in guiding self-study theory and answering difficult questions is also very little, this kind of seminar and discussion is especially necessary. In this case, the theoretical study of senior cadres in the Industrial Department of the Northeast People's Government has established a strict system, which is also a good experience. Some people believe that the study of senior cadres should rely on consciousness and there is no need to carry out any strict supervision and inspection, which is completely wrong. Experience has proved that due to the heavy workload, coupled with the fact that many cadres have not yet developed the habit of studying, if there is no strict supervision and inspection, self-study will become self-willed. Responsible comrades of the organization and Party organizations must take on the responsibility of supervision and inspection.

    In the current new upsurge of Marxist-Leninist study formed by senior cadres throughout the Party due to studying Stalin's works and the documents of the 19th Congress of the CPSU, many better experiences will surely be generated. We believe that as long as the leading comrades of each organization can conscientiously lead the study and adhere to the correct policy of combining theory with practice, the study of senior cadres throughout the Party will surely be raised to a new stage.

### 必须重视高级干部的理论学习

    必须重视高级干部的理论学习
    目前全党的高级干部正在热烈地学习斯大林同志的伟大著作“苏联社会主义经济问题”，马林科夫同志在联共第十九次代表大会上关于联共中央工作的总结报告，以及联共第十九次代表大会的其他文件。在中央一级和中央局一级的机关中，已经出现不少善于学习和善于领导学习的范例。我们应当要求所有高级干部都能向这些范例看齐，使我们的理论学习真正达到提高思想、改进工作的目的，并且使这种理论学习经常化。
    毛泽东同志从来就很重视高级干部的理论学习。他在一九三八年中国共产党的第六届中央委员会第六次全体会议的报告中，曾经特别号召高级干部加强学习和研究马克思列宁主义的理论。毛泽东同志说，对于马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的理论，“中央委员和高级干部尤其应当加紧研究”。他又说，“在担负主要领导责任的观点上说，如果我们党有一百个至二百个系统地而不是零碎地、实际地而不是空洞地学会了马克思列宁主义的同志，就会大大地提高我们党的战斗力量，并加速我们战胜日本帝国主义的工作。”
    我们有不少高级干部经常注意提高自己的理论政治水平，抓紧各种机会进行马克思列宁主义的学习。但也有不少高级干部不注意这种学习。甚至有些高级干部比一般干部学得少、学得差。也有少数的高级干部终日忙于事务而根本不进行理论学习。这种情况显然已经到了必须结束的时候了。这不仅是因为妨碍经常学习的某些客观条件已经有所改善，并将继续获得改善，而且，主要是因为我们正面临着极艰巨极复杂的经济建设任务。“工欲善其事，必先利其器。”这就是说，为要完成我们的巨大任务，我们就必须努力学习理论，提高自己的思想水平，掌握客观事物的运动法则，从而获得预见的能力，否则我们就会眼光短浅，或者盲目冒进，或者故步自封，我们就会使工作受到损失，就有不能完成国家任务的危险。
    为了加强高级干部的理论学习，固然需要靠每个同志自觉地努力，但同时也需要在各个机关内建立一定的制度，实行必要的帮助和督促。在这方面，东北人民政府工业部高级干部的理论学习就是一个良好的例子。（见今日本报第三版）他们的学习能坚持不断将近三年之久，并对提高干部改进工作起了极显著的作用。今天本报介绍了他们的经验，因为这一经验对于目前全党高级干部的学习是有益的，并可说明下列四个问题：
    第一，理论学习对改进工作的作用是明显的，巨大的。东北人民政府工业部高级干部的理论学习获得了一些什么成绩呢？主要就是：克服了某些干部中单搞业务忽视政治的危险倾向，扩大和提高了干部的政治远见；克服了某些干部的本位主义和事务主义的作风，改进了他们的领导方法。干部的政治积极性提高了，工作中的弯路减少了，上下级的步调一致了。他们的理论学习，特别是苏联社会主义经济建设理论的学习，对于恢复和发展东北工业生产的领导工作有直接的联系，起了极大的启发作用。几乎所有参加学习的高级干部都认为自己工作的成绩和基本理论的学习是分不开的。东北人民政府工业部领导同志倚靠抓紧理论学习来提高工作和干部水平的做法，是完全正确的，是应该推广的。
    第二，高级干部理论学习能否坚持的关键，在于主要负责干部的认识和决心。如果主要负责干部认真重视领导干部的理论学习，把它当做自己领导工作中的一个重要组成部分，并且以身作则地带头学习，坚持学习制度，学习就能够坚持下去。如果领导干部不重视，不支持，不坚持学习制度，并且自己也不积极学习，学习就很难坚持下去。自然，高级干部工作忙，时间少，这是一个困难。但是，东北人民政府工业部的领导同志下了决心，并且把工作作适当的安排，这个困难就克服了。等到学习获得效果之后，大家就认为学习是做好工作不可缺少的项目了。工业部是一个极紧张忙碌的机关，过去两三年又是恢复工作和各种群众运动极紧迫的两三年，他们还是能够始终坚持学习，一直不曾中断，那么，为什么其它机关在今后工作日益走上正轨的情况下，却抽不出时间学习呢？此外，领导同志带头认真地学习，不仅可以提高旁人学习的积极性，而且，一般说来，由于他们思想理论水平较高，实际经验较多，对工作业务中的情况和问题较明了，因而可以使理论学习和实际工作更密切地结合起来，提高学习的思想水平，帮助大家更好地进行学习。
    第三，高级干部的理论学习必须坚持理论和实际的密切结合。我们的理论学习从来是为着实际的革命和建设事业的需要，负着繁重的实际工作责任的高级干部，尤其要求理论学习能够对工作有直接的帮助。当然，负着领导责任的高级干部所关心的不能够只限于他自己业务工作范围以内的一部分事情和暂时的事情。为了提高自己的工作水平，一般说来，高级干部所最需要的是通过马克思列宁主义的理论学习来学习工作方法、领导方法，学习怎样去掌握在工作中所遇到的各种事情的客观规律性，学习掌握一件工作和周围其他工作的关系。同时，在各个不同部门中工作的高级干部，按照业务工作的需要而首先着重学习与自己工作直接相关的理论知识，也是必要的。例如，工业部和其它财经机关的高级干部，着重学习列宁斯大林关于社会主义经济建设的理论著作；政治法律部门或文化教育部门的高级干部，着重学习马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林和毛泽东同志有关政治法律和文化教育的理论著作。东北工业部的经验和其他经验都证明，只要力求做到“学以致用”，在高级干部中的马克思列宁主义的理论学习是能够很好地进行的，反之，如果不顾实际工作的需要，就往往会半途而废。自然，从长期的观点看，必须使高级干部的理论学习日益具有系统性，并把许多马克思列宁主义理论的基本著作列为必读书籍。但这是要逐步来做的。
    第四，高级干部的学习方法，虽主要依靠个人的自修，但必须组织适当的座谈讨论，并必须加强督促和检查。适当的座谈讨论，能起启发思想、加强学习效果的作用，不应加以忽视。由于目前缺少帮助高级干部学习理论的指导员（或辅导员），而报纸杂志对于指导自修理论和解答疑难问题的工作也做得很少，这种座谈讨论就尤其必要。在这种情况下，东北人民政府工业部高级干部的理论学习定了严格的制度，这也是一条好经验。有人认为高级干部的学习要依靠自觉，不必进行什么严格的督促检查，这是完全不对的。经验证明，由于工作繁忙，加上许多干部还没有养成学习的习惯，如果没有严格的督促检查，就会使自修变成自流。机关负责同志和党的组织必须把督促检查的责任担当起来。
    在目前全党高级干部由于学习斯大林著作和联共第十九次代表大会文件而形成的马克思列宁主义学习的新高涨中，一定还会产生许多更好的经验。我们相信，只要各机关的领导同志能够认真负责领导学习，并坚持理论与实际结合的正确方针，全党高级干部的学习一定能够提高到一个新的阶段。
