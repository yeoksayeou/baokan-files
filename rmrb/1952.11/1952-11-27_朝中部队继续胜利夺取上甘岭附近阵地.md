Xinhua News Agency, Korean Kimhwa Front, November 26th. The battle for individual positions continues on Hill 537.7, on the left side of Triangle Hill. On the morning of the 22nd, enemy troops attacked a small hilltop, less than 100 meters long and wide, defended by a squad of our army. Our brave soldiers were blocking the enemy on the north slope, who were staying on the south slope. During this day of confrontation, we exchanged hand grenades. At 6:30 PM, our army launched a counterattack, completely recovering the position on this small hilltop. Subsequently, the enemy launched continuous counterattacks with a squad or platoon of troops. The battle lasted until the morning of the 23rd, and all six enemy counterattacks were completely repulsed. Currently, with the exception of a small hilltop on the ground that is temporarily occupied by the enemy, all other positions on Hill 537.7 are in our army's hands.

While the battle near Triangle Hill is raging, our army continues to send small units to attack the enemy west of Kimhwa. On one occasion, a combat team of our army sneaked onto a small high ground and killed the enemy sentries. When a platoon of enemy troops heard the gunfire, they rushed over. Our army immediately dispatched an additional combat team to outflank the enemy's rear, coordinating with fierce frontal fire to launch a two-pronged attack. After a short battle, our army killed or wounded 22 enemy soldiers and captured four light machine guns. The remaining enemies fled in panic.

    朝中部队继续胜利夺取上甘岭附近阵地
    【新华社朝鲜金化前线二十六日电】上甘岭左边山岭——五三七点七高地上仍在进行个别阵地的争夺战。二十二日晨，敌军向我军一个班守卫的长宽不到一百公尺的小山头进行攻击。我军勇士们在小山头的北坡阻击着停留在南坡上的敌人。敌我在这一天对峙中互相投掷手榴弹。下午六时半我军发起反击，将这个小山头上的阵地全部收复。随后敌人用一个班或一个排的兵力进行连续的反扑。战斗一直持续到二十三日早晨，敌人六次反扑都被完全击退。现在五三七点七高地上除一处小山头的地面阵地被敌人暂时占据以外，其他的阵地都在我军手中。
    当上甘岭附近山岭的战斗正在激烈地进行着的时候，我军不断地派出小部队袭击金化以西的敌人。有一次，我军一个战斗小组摸到一个小高地上打死了敌人的哨兵。当时一个排的敌人听到枪声急忙赶来，我军当即增派一个战斗小组迂回到这股敌人的侧后，配合正面的猛烈火力施行两面夹击。经过短时间的战斗，我军打死打伤敌军二十二名，缴获轻机枪四挺。其余的敌人狼狈逃去。
