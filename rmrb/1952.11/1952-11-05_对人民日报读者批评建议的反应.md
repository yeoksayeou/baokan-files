Responses to Readers' Criticisms and Suggestions in People's Daily

    Editor's Note: We are now publishing below a summary of responses from various sectors to readers' criticisms and suggestions in the People's Daily.
    ▲ The Education Department of the Hebei Provincial People's Government wrote to us, accepting the suggestions from readers Cai Qinchang and Liaoyuan requesting the department to increase the number of Hebei Province Beijing Normal School students staying at school during the summer vacation who receive People's Scholarships (original suggestion published on the "Reader's Letters" page on August 1st) and the opinions of the editor's note in this newspaper. They made a self-criticism of their bureaucratic work style in subjectively and hastily determining the number of students staying at school and resolved to learn from this lesson to improve their future work. For students at Beijing Normal School who have real financial difficulties and have not received People's Scholarships in the past, the department has notified the school to issue People's Scholarships to them.
    ▲ The Chinese Communist Party Chaoyang County Committee of Rehe wrote to us, accepting reader Li Zhengguan's criticism of the leadership organs of the 13th District of the county for accumulating donation funds (original criticism letter published on the "Reader's Letters" page on August 9th). They sent special personnel to the 13th District to investigate and found that the donation work in the district was extremely chaotic, not only accumulating donation funds for a year but also involving corruption. The County Committee made a self-criticism of their serious bureaucratic work style in only issuing instructions and not inspecting the work in the past and instructed the District Committee to thoroughly clear up the donation funds and investigate responsibilities. With regard to dereliction of duty and corruption among the cadres involved in this issue, appropriate punishments will be given according to the severity of the circumstances after the facts are ascertained.
    ▲ After the "Reader's Letters" page published reader Liu Zhennan's letter on August 13th, "Suggestions on Strengthening Forest Protection Work in Shaanxi Province," the Shaanxi Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry wrote to us saying: "This department issued a circular on June 7th, criticizing the phenomenon of neglecting forest protection work in some areas of this province and put forward suggestions for improvement. Comrade Liu Zhennan's letter was written based on the materials in the circular. The circular mentioned the burning of mountains and destruction of forests in Ningshan County, which Comrade Liu Zhennan mistakenly wrote as Ningqiang County and should be corrected." (Editor's Note: When reporting to the newspaper based on the materials in the circular, attention must be paid to comprehensiveness and the source of the materials should be indicated. Comrade Liu Zhennan only raised some facts about past neglect of forest protection in his letter and did not state that the Shaanxi Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry had already paid attention to correction, which is one-sided. Such a reflection is naturally not entirely in line with reality. We hope Comrade Liu Zhennan will correct this in the future.)
    ▲ The Chinese Communist Party Pizhou-Sui County Committee of Northern Jiangsu wrote to us, accepting reader Cheng Shuzhen's criticism of the county's health work team for forcing people to get injections, causing adverse effects (original criticism letter published on the "Reader's Letters" page on August 13th). The letter stated: "Some parts of the reader's criticism are inconsistent with the facts, but most of it is correct. Our county's health work team did not do enough publicity and explanation work when giving injections to the masses, and the method was simple and crude, which did cause bad effects. We did not educate the cadres enough and should make a deep self-criticism. In addition, we suggest that the County People's Government instruct the Health Section and the People's Hospital to conduct inspections and publicize the benefits of vaccination to the masses to eliminate adverse effects."
    ▲ The Fuyang Branch of the China Grain Corporation wrote to us, accepting reader Wang Shuli's criticism (original criticism letter published on the "Reader's Letters" page on August 13th). The letter contained a self-criticism of the reasons for not doing a good job in grain storage: first, there is a lack of a high degree of responsibility to the people in the work attitude; second, leading cadres have a bureaucratic work style, with more arrangements and less inspection of the work of subordinates. Zhao Xingshi, the manager of the company, has also requested punishment from the Anhui Provincial Grain Corporation. At the same time, the letter also pointed out that there were some discrepancies in the degree of individual places in the original criticism from the reader.

### 对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    对人民日报读者批评建议的反应
    编者按：今将各方面对人民日报读者批评建议的反应摘要发表于后。
    ▲河北省人民政府教育厅来信，接受读者蔡秦昌、燎原要求该厅增加河北省北京师范学校暑期留校学生享受人民助学金待遇的名额的建议（原建议刊八月一日“读者来信专页”）和本报编者按语的意见。他们对主观草率地决定留校学生名额的官僚主义工作作风作了检讨，决心吸取这个教训改进今后的工作。对于北京师范学校生活确有困难而过去未享受人民助学金的学生，该厅已通知该校发给人民助学金。
    ▲中共热河朝阳县委员会来信，接受读者李正冠对该县十三区领导机关积压捐献款项的批评（原批评信刊八月九日“读者来信专页”）。他们派专人到十三区去检查，发现该区捐献工作十分混乱，不但把捐献款项积压了一年，并且还有贪污情况。县委会检讨了他们过去只发指示、不检查工作的严重的官僚主义作风，并指示该区区委彻底清理捐献款项，检查责任。对有关这一问题的渎职、贪污干部，待事实查清后，将分别情节轻重，给予适当的处分。
    ▲八月十三日“读者来信专页”发表了读者刘振南“建议陕西省加强护林工作”的来信后，陕西省农林厅来信说：“本厅在六月七日发出通报，批评本省某些地区忽视护林工作的现象，并提出了改进意见。刘振南同志的来信就是根据通报中的材料写成的。通报中提到宁陕县发生烧山及破坏森林的事情，刘振南同志误写成宁强县了，应予更正。”（编者按：根据通报的材料向报社反映时，必须注意全面，并应注明材料的来源。刘振南同志来信时仅仅提出过去忽视护林的一些事实，没有说明陕西省农林厅已经注意纠正，这是有片面性的。这样反映自然也就不完全切合实际了。希望刘振南同志今后加以改正。）
    ▲中共苏北邳睢县委员会来信，接受读者程树榛对该县卫生工作队强迫给群众打针、造成不良影响的批评（原批评信刊八月十三日“读者来信专页”）。来信说：“读者批评中某些地方与事实不符，但大部是正确的。我县卫生工作队为群众打针时宣传解释工作做得不够，方法简单生硬，的确造成了不好的影响。我们对干部教育不够，应该深刻检讨。此外，我们建议县人民政府责成卫生科和人民医院进行检查，并向群众宣传注射疫苗的好处，以消除不良影响。”
    ▲中国粮食公司阜阳支公司来信，接受读者王书李的批评（原批评信刊八月十三日“读者来信专页”）。来信中检讨了粮食保管工作做得不好的原因：首先是缺乏高度对人民负责的工作态度；其次是领导干部有官僚主义作风，对下级的工作布置多、检查少。该公司经理赵兴世并已向安徽省粮食公司自请处分。同时来信中也指出读者原批评有个别地方在分寸上有出入。
