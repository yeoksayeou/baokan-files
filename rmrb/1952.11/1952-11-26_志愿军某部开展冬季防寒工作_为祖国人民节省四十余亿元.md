    A Certain Unit of the Chinese People's Volunteers Carries Out Winter Cold Prevention Work
    Saving Over Forty Billion Yuan for the People of the Motherland
    Editor: In order to ensure strong troops and deal more severe blows to the enemy, our unit has launched four major tasks for winter cold prevention: cutting horse grass, collecting firewood, burning charcoal, and building heated kang beds. From mid-September to the end of October, we cut a total of 10,573,188 catties of horse grass, collected 8,409,897 catties of firewood, burned 795,415 catties of charcoal (exceeding the original plan by 343,515 catties), and built 1,734 heated kang beds. The three items of cutting horse grass, collecting firewood, and burning charcoal alone saved the people of the motherland 4,438,888,600 yuan.

    Like in combat, we overcame many difficulties in our work. For example, it was not easy to find grass areas for such a large-scale grass cutting operation. To find grass areas, the responsible comrade of a certain unit went to the west of the Imjin River for reconnaissance. Another unit organized personnel to cut grass dozens of miles away. To solve the shortage of tools, some comrades searched for scrap iron along the roads and made their own sickles and hatchets. Others went to the mountains to cut tree branches and weave their own baskets.

    Throughout the work, everyone maintained a full spirit. The comrades who burned charcoal said: "Burning good charcoal will ensure that the comrades on the front lines do not eat cold food and do not suffer from the cold." Many comrades braved the severe cold to go to the mountains to cut grass and collect firewood before dawn. Soldier Xian Haiqing collected 3,000 catties of firewood in one day. Soldier Song Helu cut 1,000 catties of horse grass in one day. Our hard work has been assisted and praised by the Korean people. They voluntarily sent us many tools to borrow. They said: The Chinese People's Volunteers are not only heroes in killing the enemy, but also skilled workers.

### 志愿军某部开展冬季防寒工作  为祖国人民节省四十余亿元

    志愿军某部开展冬季防寒工作
    为祖国人民节省四十余亿元
    编辑同志：为了保证兵强马壮，更严重地打击敌人，我部开展了冬季防寒的四大工作——割马草、打柴、烧木炭、筑暖炕。自九月中旬至十月底，共割马草一千零五十七万三千一百八十八斤，打柴八百四十万九千八百九十七斤，烧木炭七十九万五千四百一十五斤（超过原订计划三十四万三千五百一十五斤），修筑暖炕一千七百三十四个。只打马草、打柴、烧木炭三项，就给祖国人民节省了四十四亿三千八百八十八万六千元。
    和战斗一样，我们在工作中克服了许多困难。例如，这样大规模割草，找到草区就不容易。为了寻找草区，某部的负责同志亲到临津江以西侦察。另一个单位则组织人员到数十里以外去割草。为了解决工具不够的困难，有的同志沿公路寻觅废铁，自己打造镰刀、柴刀。有的则上山砍树条，自己编成筐子。
    在工作中，大家始终保持着饱满的情绪。烧木炭的同志说：“烧好木炭，保证前沿阵地的同志们不吃冷饭，不受冻。”许多同志天不亮就冒着严寒到山上去割草、打柴。战士先海清一天就打了三千斤柴。战士宋河路一天割了一千斤马草。我们的辛勤劳动得到了朝鲜人民的协助和称赞。他们自动送来许多工具借给我们。他们说：志愿军不光是杀敌英雄，还都是劳动能手。
