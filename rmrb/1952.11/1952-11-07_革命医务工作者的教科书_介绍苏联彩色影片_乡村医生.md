    This is a Soviet film, a hymn to life, and a textbook for revolutionary medical workers. The story is not complicated, just the ordinary activities of a rural hospital and a group of rural medical workers. But from here, we hear the pulse of the new socialist rural life, feel the warm exchange between the men and women of the collective farm and the village doctors, and see the development and resolution of personality conflicts and ideological clashes between doctors. Everything is so simple, natural, principled, and full of human touch. This is precisely where its powerful infectious power and profound educational significance lie. After watching this film, we deeply understand a truth: only by truly understanding the meaning and value of human life can we love life and serve life wholeheartedly; and only those who wholeheartedly serve life can increasingly understand the meaning and value of life and love life even more.

    The head of the village hospital, Arsenyev, is a 76-year-old doctor who has served here for more than 50 years. More than 50 years of working time, more than 50 years of work experience, more than 50 years of close contact with the local people! Regarding his life experience and inner feelings, there is a moving description in his conversation with the new young female doctor, Korshakova: "...I am 76 years old, and it is very difficult to get up at night. When the phone rings at night, asking me to go to the hospital to see a patient, or asking me to go to the farm, I am really scared. You must never tell anyone these words. For fifty years, I have never refused anyone who asked me to see a doctor. If the situation is not urgent, the patient's family will not bother you. ... Just quietly recall how many people have knocked on my window at night... Some have to run dozens of miles, whether it is winter or summer, rain or snow. They ran here, knocking on the window, some knocking very lightly, some knocking very hard. I prepared my own horse and went out to see the patient. How much road I walked on foot, wind and rain. I also had typhoid fever..." During the domestic revolutionary war, he was shot several times by the White Army for treating the Red Army; after the victory of the October Revolution, he was ambushed by counter-revolutionary elements for participating in the collectivization movement. He personally watched how many collective farms were built on the desolate grasslands, how the local residents who "often drank and fought, and drew their swords to duel at the slightest disagreement" became new people of collectivism, and how his hospital constantly changed its face with the development of the Soviet countryside. Such an old doctor must love his motherland and people, love his work, and love his hospital, just like a farmer loves the bountiful crops irrigated with his own blood and sweat, and a mother loves the child raised with her own milk, not allowing anyone to say a word "bad". Therefore, in terms of personality, he appears confident, stubborn, conceited, and even a little "eccentric" at first glance. This personality is fully expressed in his first conversation with Korshakova.

    Kor: Do you have X-rays here?
    Ars: No X-rays.
    Kor: How can you work without X-rays?
    Ars: There is a way! We have brains. We must use knowledge and experience!
    Kor: Isn't it easy to make mistakes?
    Ars: Can't make mistakes. You are not allowed to make mistakes! A doctor's mistake is related to human life!
    The debate-style dialogue continued, and the old doctor finally couldn't bear it anymore:
    "When I came to this village fifty years ago, was there such a situation today? It was completely desolate! There were plagues and cholera. Now you only know what is lacking and what is missing, and you want to sit back and enjoy the fruits of others' labor. That's not okay, young people, everything has to be done by yourself..."
    Here, we not only see Arsenyev's outstanding personality, but also glimpse Korshakova's advantages and disadvantages. If the former is a calm and experienced warrior who has experienced many battles, then the latter is a vigorous new force with more ideals than experience and stronger enthusiasm than reason. The Great Patriotic War cut off Korshakova's studies. She worked as a nurse on the front line for two years, suffered serious injuries, and returned to the rear, finally graduating from university. She came to the countryside with full of enthusiasm and unwavering determination, but at the beginning, she was not really able to withstand the test of reality. When she encountered setbacks or failures in her work, her emotions became uncontrollable. However, as she herself said, she was not afraid of difficulties, nor was she pursuing an easy life. What she urgently needed was others' trust in her. When some patients initially seemed to distrust her, she cried sadly. In terms of age, experience, and many aspects of personality, she and the old director had great differences, but in the depths of her soul, there was also the same confidence and stubbornness as the old director. Therefore, in the early days of her work at the village hospital, her contact with the old director was sometimes like a flint striking a stone, sparking "conflict". But with the development of common life and common work, with the gradual realization of common hopes, and with the deepening of mutual understanding, they finally established a very close combat friendship. These are the true images of two "life savers" of different ages and experiences, but living in the same Soviet land and under the Stalin sunlight.

    In contrast to these two images is another young doctor, Chomukin—a laggard on the Soviet medical front. Under the influence of bourgeois individualism, he was preoccupied with personal fame and "development prospects," while indifferent to the lives of patients. He admired the "serious scientific work" in Moscow, but looked down on the rural environment, the poorly equipped rural hospitals, and the rural doctors who "traveled to see patients in a dusty car," believing that "modern medical technology has reached a considerable level. Nothing can be done in hospitals with such equipment." Such a doctor cannot gain a foothold in the Soviet medical community, and his "development prospects" are not rebirth, but destruction. However, Soviet society has the obligation and the power to save any life heading for destruction. The fire in the great collective furnace finally burned the roots of individualism in Chomukin, and refined a new Chomukin.

    Through moving artistic images, this film vividly expresses the qualities of Soviet doctors, which are fundamentally different from those of bourgeois doctors. Bourgeois doctors regard the sound of gold as the best music, while Soviet doctors regard the lives of the people as priceless treasures. "...Doctors say: There are thousands of ways to get rich, so they arbitrarily capture and release patients with gonorrhea and syphilis. This is the real way to get rich (panning for gold)... It depends on how you delay treatment and pan out the last grain of gold from here." [Note] This is the character of American doctors described by Kinnap in the American reporter's record. "...The state entrusts the lives of patients to us, and the significance of our doctors lies here. ...To understand the lives of your patients, you must love mankind and be good at observing them. This is not my idea, this is the main foundation of Pavlov's entire theory..." "Dear friend, you must also remember this: our work is not only to treat diseases, but we should also participate in the spiritual life of the people. We are all rural intellectuals." This is the character of Soviet doctors said by old director Arsenyev. "The Village Doctor" points out the direction of efforts for revolutionary medical workers all over the world.

    For the medical workers of New China, "The Village Doctor" has special educational significance, and we should draw infinitely rich spiritual nourishment from this film. The valuable experiences of Arsenyev and Korshakova, and the profound lessons of Chomukin, should become living teaching materials for the medical workers of New China. The brilliant achievements of the Soviet medical cause are the vision of our medical cause; the Soviet medical workers are the guides for our medical workers. Korshakova said at the Moscow Village Doctor Congress: "Comrades, we all know how our party and our government attach importance to the health problems of our people, and we feel this great care every day. Our village doctors have seen how fast the struggle for the people's health and longevity is progressing. ...A few figures can explain it. When Arsenyev started working, there were only thirty-two doctors in the entire region, but now there are three hundred and forty-six doctors. At that time, there were only eighteen secondary medical workers, but now there are two thousand five hundred and sixty. What do these figures explain? They not only show the increase of rural medical workers in our motherland, but also the fundamental changes in the lives of rural people, the unprecedented growth of rural culture, and the elimination of the boundaries between cities and villages under the Soviet system!..." How intimate this voice is to us, it makes us confidently think of everything in our own motherland. So, should only medical workers be educated by the film "The Village Doctor"?

    革命医务工作者的教科书
    ——介绍苏联彩色影片“乡村医生”
    林淡秋

    莫斯科高尔基电影制片厂出品  中央电影局东北电影制片厂译制
    这是一部苏联影片，一首生命的颂歌，一部革命医务工作者的教科书。故事并不复杂，一个乡村医院，一群乡村医务工作者的平凡的活动。但从这里，我们听到社会主义农村新生活的脉搏，感到集体农庄男女庄员们与乡村医生之间的热情的交流，看到医生与医生之间的性格矛盾和思想冲突的发展和解决。一切是那样朴素，自然，那样富于原则性，又那样富于人情味。这正是它的强大感染力量和深刻的教育意义之所在。看了这部影片，我们深深体会到一个真理：只有真正了解人的生命的意义和价值，才能热爱生命，才能全心全意为生命服务；也只有全心全意为生命服务的人，才能日益深刻地了解生命的意义和价值，更加热爱生命。
    乡村医院院长阿尔先耶夫，是一个七十六岁的老医生，他在这里服务了五十多年。五十多年的工作时间，五十多年的工作经验，五十多年的跟当地群众的密切联系！关于他的生活经历和内心体验，在他和新来的年轻女医生柯沙阔瓦的谈话中，就有一段动人的描写：“……我七十六岁了，夜里起来就非常困难。黑夜里来了电话，要我到医院去看病，或叫我上农庄去，我真害怕。这些话，你千万不能跟别人讲。五十年来，无论谁请我看病，我还没有拒绝过。要是情况不紧急，病人家也不会来惊动你。……只要悄悄地回想一下有多少人在夜间敲过我的窗户呀……有的要跑几十里路，不论是冬是夏，下雨落雪。他们跑来了，敲着窗户，有的敲得很轻，有的敲得很猛。我就备上自己那匹马出去看病。用腿走过多少路呀，风吹，雨淋。还得过伤寒病……”在国内战争时期，他因为给红军治病而遭受白党的几次枪击；在十月革命胜利以后，他又因参加集体化运动而遭受过反革命分子的暗算。他亲眼看着满目荒凉的草原上怎样建立起了许多集体农庄，看着“常常酗酒打架，一言不合便拔剑决斗”的当地居民怎样变成了集体主义的新人，看着自己的医院怎样跟着苏维埃乡村的发展而不断改变自己的面貌。这样的老医生必然要热爱自己的祖国和人民，热爱自己的工作，热爱自己的医院，就像农民热爱用自己血汗灌溉成的丰收的庄稼，母亲热爱用自己奶汁喂养大的孩子一样，不容任何人说一声“不好”。因此，在性格上，他便显得自信、倔强、自负，甚至初看起来，还有点“怪癖”。在他和柯沙阔瓦的初次谈话中，就充分表现了这种性格。
    柯：咱们这儿有爱克斯光吗？
    阿：爱克斯光没有。
    柯：没有爱克斯光，怎样工作呢？
    阿：有办法！我们有脑袋。要运用知识和经验！
    柯：那不是容易搞错吗？
    阿：不能搞错。不许你搞错！医生的错误有关人的生命！
    辩论式的对话继续下去，老医生终于忍耐不住了：
    “五十年前我到这村子时，有今天这样情况吗？完全是一片荒凉！闹瘟疫，闹霍乱。现在你们光知道缺这个，少那个，想坐享其成。这样不行呀，年青人，一切还得自己动手。……”
    在这里，我们不但看到了阿尔先耶夫的突出的性格，同时也窥见了柯沙阔瓦的优点和缺点。如果说前者是饱经战斗的沉着老练的战士，那末后者就是理想多于经验、热情强于理知的朝气勃勃的生力军。卫国战争切断了柯沙阔瓦的学习，她在前线做了两年护士，受了重伤，回到后方，终于在大学毕了业。她带着满腔的热情和不可动摇的决心来到了乡村，可是开头还不是真正经得起实际的考验。当她在工作中碰到挫折或失败时，她的情绪便激动得不能自制了。然而正如她自己所说，她不是怕困难，不是追求容易的生活，她所迫切需要的是别人对她的信任。当某些病人最初对她似乎不大信任的时候，她难过得哭了。在年龄上，在阅历上，在性格的许多方面，她和老院长都有很大的差别，但在她的灵魂深处，同样存在着老院长的那种自信和倔强。所以在她到乡村医院工作的初期，她和老院长的接触，有时真像火刀碰到火石一样，迸发出“冲突”的火花。但跟着共同生活和共同工作的开展，跟着共同希望的逐步实现，跟着相互了解的不断加深，他们之间终于建立了非常亲密的战斗友谊。这是有着不同年龄和经历、但同样生活在苏维埃国土上和斯大林阳光中的两个“生命拯救者”的真实形象。
    跟这两个形象相对照的是另一个青年医生乔木金——苏联医疗战线上的落伍者。在资产阶级个人主义思想影响的支配下，他念念不忘个人的名位和“发展前途”，而对于病人的生命却无动于衷。他仰慕莫斯科的“严肃的科学工作”，却看不起乡村环境，看不起设备不全的乡村医院，看不起“风尘仆仆地”坐着小车去看病的乡村医生，认为“现代医学技术已达到相当水平。在这种设备的医院里干不出什么来”。这样的医生是不可能在苏联医学界立足的，他的“发展前途”不是新生，而是毁灭。然而苏维埃社会有义务也有力量挽救任何走向毁灭的生命，伟大的集体熔炉里的烈火，终于烧毁了残留在乔木金身上的个人主义思想感情的根株，炼出了一个新生的乔木金。
    这部影片通过动人的艺术形象，鲜明地表现了在本质上不同于资产阶级医生的苏联医生的品质。资产阶级的医生把黄金的响声当作最好的音乐，而苏联的医生则把人民的生命看作无价的珍宝。“……医师说：有千方百计可以发财致富，对淋病患者和梅毒病患者所以任意擒纵。这是真正的发财之道（砂里淘金）……要看你如何拖延治疗，从这里淘出最后一颗金砂。”〔注〕这就是金纳普在美国记者录中所描写的美国医生的品德。“……国家把病人的生命交给我们，我们医生的意义便在这里。……为了解你的病人的生命，就要爱人类，要善于观察他们。这并不是我的思想，这是巴甫洛夫全部学说的主要基础。……”“亲爱的朋友，你还要记住这一点：我们的工作不仅是治病，我们还应当参加到人民的精神生活里去。我们都是农村知识分子呀。”这就是阿尔先耶夫老院长所说的苏联医生的品德。“乡村医生”为全世界革命医务工作者指出了努力的方向。
    对新中国的医务工作者来说，“乡村医生”更有特别的教育意义，应该从这部影片里吸取无限丰富的精神养分。阿尔先耶夫们和柯沙阔瓦们的宝贵经验，乔木金们的深刻教训，应该成为新中国医务工作者的活教材。苏联医疗事业的辉煌成就，就是我国医疗事业的远景；苏联的医务工作者正是我国医务工作者的领路人。柯沙阔瓦在莫斯科乡村医生代表大会上说：“同志们，我们大家全知道我们的党和我们的政府是怎样重视我们全国人民的保健问题，我们每天都感到这种伟大的关怀。我们乡村医生看见了为人民健康和长寿的斗争是以怎样的速度在进展着。……几个数目字就可以说明了。当阿尔先耶夫开始工作时，这里全区只有三十二个医生，现在却有三百四十六个医生了。当时中等医务工作人员只有十八个，现在却有二千五百六十个了。这些数目字说明了什么呢？它们不仅说明了我们祖国乡村医务工作人员的增加，而且说明了乡村人民生活的根本改变，说明了乡村文化的空前成长，说明了在苏维埃制度下城市和乡村界限的消灭！……”这在我们听来是多么亲切的声音啊，它使我们满怀信心地联想起自己祖国的一切。那末应该接受影片“乡村医生”的教育的，难道仅仅是医务工作者吗？
