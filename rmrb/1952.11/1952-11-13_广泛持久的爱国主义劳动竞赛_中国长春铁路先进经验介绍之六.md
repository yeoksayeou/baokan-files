    Extensive and Enduring Patriotic Labor Competition
    —Introduction to the Advanced Experience of China's Changchun Railway (6)
    Ren Hong, Director of the Propaganda Department of the Political Department of the China Changchun Railway

    From the day it was established, the China Changchun Railway, under the guidance of Soviet experts, organized extensive and enduring patriotic labor competitions in a new way.

    Over the past two years, with the improvement of the political consciousness of all employees, the competition movement has gradually deepened. Currently, the number of participants in the competition has reached more than 96% of all employees. In this competition movement with a solid mass foundation, the production and financial plans for 1950 and 1951 were overfulfilled, and many advanced workers emerged, creating Li Xikui's shunting method, Zheng Xikun's overload, 500-kilometer operation method, and Yang Maolin's loading method, which are being promoted throughout the country's railways, greatly improving labor productivity.

    The China Changchun Railway's competition is based on production and financial plans, focusing on improving labor productivity and reducing costs. The annual production and financial plan stipulates how many ton-kilometers and the cost per ton-kilometer. However, the railway is a large and complex linkage. The production output of many departments cannot be directly expressed in ton-kilometers. Therefore, each quarter, the Administration and Branch Bureau propose competition guarantee conditions based on the needs of the production and financial plan, as the direction of struggle for the entire Administration and each Branch Bureau. Each month, each business unit proposes its own competition guarantee conditions based on production targets, and uses specific figures to indicate the economic effect of each production target (such as the value of each car-hour, the value of each ton-kilometer), and generally publishes the unit prices of major raw materials, so that each staff member knows his or her work and the resulting economic consequences, thereby combining the competition with economic accounting. On this basis, employees in the same position are organized to carry out competitions between groups and individuals, focusing on common production targets. For example, among train attendants, the competition of overload, 500 kilometers is carried out. Among shunting groups, the competition to compress transit time is carried out. Among maintenance workers, the competition to compress repair time and save materials is carried out, etc.

    The China Changchun Railway regards organizing competitions as a regular method of completing national tasks. Since the announcement of the 1950 production and financial plan, the Administration organized the Red Flag competition for the entire Administration, and combined mastering daily business with mastering the completion of competition conditions. Therefore, for more than two years, the competition of the China Changchun Railway has never been interrupted. Each month, the Administration evaluates the results of the competition and awards the winner with a rotating Red Flag. During the competition process, the Administration grasps the competition situation of each Branch Bureau, special-class and first-class stations, and major sections and major enterprises. The Branch Bureau grasps the competition situation of second, third, fourth, and fifth-class stations and each sub-section. Each grassroots unit grasps the competition situation of each production team. In this way, all employees can be regularly organized into the competition. At the end of each month, the Administration's competent departments propose the competition results of each Branch Bureau, station, and section based on the materials mastered in daily business, and submit them to the meetings attended by the Party Committee, Administration, Trade Union, and Youth League for discussion and approval. Before the fifth of each month, the Administration announces the results of the competition to the entire railway at the telephone conference, not only announcing the best and worst units, but also announcing the ranking of all units. After the announcement, the unit that lost the Red Flag sends representatives to deliver the Red Flag to the newly winning unit. In grassroots units, the results of the competition are announced every day. Therefore, the competition in grassroots units can more timely promote the improvement of work. For example, each locomotive depot announces the coal consumption situation every day, requiring everyone to pay attention to saving coal, thus achieving results. In the first half of this year, 331 locomotives consumed excessive coal, but in September this year, only 72 locomotives consumed excessive coal. In order to overcome the tendency of simply strengthening physical labor, in the competition movement, the leading aspects of the China Changchun Railway Administration pay attention to cultivating new heroic figures who master advanced technologies, and promote their advanced methods. At present, the advanced methods of Li Xikui, Zheng Xikun, and Yang Maolin of the China Changchun Railway have become an inseparable part of leading the competition. Each unit also pays attention to cultivating advanced workers in its own unit in the competition to promote the progress of its own unit.

    In the evaluation of the Red Flag, traffic safety and labor protection are placed in the first place. Even if a unit completes production targets very well, as long as there is a death accident or a major accident, it will be rated as the lowest.

    The China Changchun Railway regards the fundamental change of the economic situation of employees as one of the foundations of the competition. The leadership of the China Changchun Railway pays great attention to the improvement of the lives of employees in the competition. Over the past two years, the wages of employees of the China Changchun Railway have increased by 94.7%. Although the prices of raw materials and fuels have risen, the proportion of wages in the total expenditure of the China Changchun Railway is constantly increasing. In 1951, wages accounted for 26.7% of the total expenditure, but in 1952, it accounted for 32.6%. This shows that employees have made achievements in reducing costs, but it also shows that with the improvement of production, the lives of employees are also improving.

    Under the guidance of Soviet experts, the competition of the China Changchun Railway is extensive and lasting. Because some Chinese comrades do not have enough experience with the rich experience introduced by Soviet experts, and do not have a deep understanding of the consistency of completing tasks, promoting advanced experience, and organizing competitions, some units still have a tendency of formalism in the competition, which needs to be overcome.

    广泛持久的爱国主义劳动竞赛
    ——中国长春铁路先进经验介绍之六
    中长地区铁路政治部宣传部部长  任宏
    中长铁路从成立的那天起，就在苏联专家的指导下，以新的方式组织了广泛持久的爱国主义劳动竞赛。
    二年多来，随着全体职工政治觉悟的提高，竞赛运动逐步深入发展起来。目前参加竞赛的人数，已达全体职工的百分之九十六以上。在这个有着深厚群众基础上的竞赛运动中，超额完成了一九五○年和一九五一年生产财务计划，涌现了很多先进工作者，创造了正在全国铁路推广的李锡奎调车法，郑锡坤超轴、五百公里作业法，杨茂林装车法，大大地提高了劳动生产率。
    中长铁路的竞赛是以生产财务计划为基础，以提高劳动生产率，降低成本为中心。每年的生产财务计划中都规定了多少吨公里和每一吨公里的成本。但铁路是一庞大复杂的联动机。很多部门的生产成品，不能直接用吨公里表示出来。因此每季度管理局、分局根据生产财务计划的需要，提出竞赛保证条件，作为全管理局和各分局的奋斗方向。每月各业务单位根据生产指标，提出本单位的竞赛保证条件，并以具体数字表明每一生产指标的经济效果（如每一车小时的价值、每一吨公里的价值），普遍地公布了主要原材料单价等，这样就使得每一工作人员知道自己工作以及所造成的经济后果，从而把竞赛和经济核算结合起来。在这样基础上，组织同样职务的职工，围绕着共同的生产指标，而展开小组与小组、个人与个人的竞赛。如在乘务员之间，开展超轴、五百公里的竞赛。在调车组之间，开展压缩中转时间的竞赛。在检修工人之间，开展压缩修车时间和节省材料的竞赛等。
    中长铁路是把组织竞赛，当作完成国家任务的经常方法。自一九五○年生产财务计划公布之后，就组织了全管理局的红旗竞赛，并且把掌握日常业务和掌握竞赛条件完成情况结合起来。所以二年多来，中长铁路的竞赛，从没有间断过一次。每一个月管理局都要评定竞赛的结果，颁发优胜循环红旗。在竞赛过程中如管理局要掌握各分局、特等、一等站和各主要段、主要企业的竞赛情况。分局要掌握二、三、四、五等站及各分段的竞赛情况。各基层单位要掌握各生产小组竞赛情况。这样就能经常地把全体职工都组织到竞赛中来。每月月终管理局的各主管处根据日常业务中掌握的材料，提出各分局、各站、段的竞赛成绩，交党委、行政、工会、青年团参加的会议上讨论、通过。在每月五日以前管理局在电话会议上，向全路宣布竞赛的结果，不仅公布最好和最坏的单位，而且公布所有单位的位次。公布后，由丢掉红旗的单位，派代表将红旗送到新得的单位。在基层单位，每天都要公布竞赛的结果。所以基层单位的竞赛更能及时地促进工作的改进。比如各机务段每天公布费煤的情况，要求大家注意省煤，因而获得了效果，今年上半年有三百三十一台机车费煤，今年九月份却只有七十二台机车费煤了。为了克服单纯地加强体力劳动的偏向，在竞赛运动中，中国长春铁路管理局领导方面注意培养掌握先进技术的新的英雄人物，并推广他们的先进方法。目前中长铁路李锡奎、郑锡坤和杨茂林的先进方法，已经成了领导竞赛的不可分离的一部分了。各单位在竞赛中还注意了培养本单位的先进工作者，以推动本单位前进。
    在评定红旗中，是把行车安全和劳动保护放在第一位的。某个单位即使完成生产指标很好，但只要出了死亡事故或重大事故，就要被评为最末位。
    中长铁路是把职工经济情况的根本改变，作为竞赛的基础之一。中长铁路领导方面，在竞赛中非常注意职工生活的改善。二年多来中长铁路职工的工资提高了百分之九十四点七。虽然原材料、燃料的价格上涨了，但在中长铁路的总支出中，工资所占的比重是不断增大的，一九五一年工资占总支出的百分之二十六点七，一九五二年却占了百分之三十二点六。这说明了职工在减低成本方面是有成绩的，但也说明随着生产的提高，职工生活也随着提高。
    在苏联专家指导下，中长铁路的竞赛是广泛和持久的。由于某些中国同志对苏联专家所介绍的丰富的经验体会不够，对完成任务，推广先进经验，组织竞赛的一致性认识不深，所以某些单位在竞赛中还有形式主义的偏向，需要克服。
