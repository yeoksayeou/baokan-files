Learning from the Soviet Union's experience in thrift is of great significance to our country's economic construction.

The socialist Soviet Union regards increasing production and practicing thrift as one of its basic policies. In the first year of the First Five-Year Plan, I was sent to the Soviet Union and witnessed the situation of thrift construction at that time, which is still vivid in my memory today.

The primary task of the First Five-Year Plan was to develop heavy industry. This required a large amount of capital accumulation and improvement of industrial equipment. The only way to accumulate a large amount of capital was to practice strict economy, give full play to the capacity of existing equipment, and expand socialist emulation.

During the years of the First Five-Year Plan, the Soviet people actively participated in the struggle to obtain huge funds for heavy industry, and everyone scrambled to save on food and clothing to accumulate funds. At that time, the Soviet Union did not produce tea, and the Soviet people were very fond of drinking tea, but in order to prevent the outflow of cash, they only drank boiled water or used substitutes. It became a habit for people to save water and electricity, and many families still have equipment for washing their faces with dripping water from that year.

The Ministry of Foreign Trade of the Soviet government played a significant role in capital accumulation during the First Five-Year Plan. I still remember one thing: The Ministry of Foreign Trade set up shops all over the country with exquisite food, clothing, and appliances. Anyone with cash, foreign currency, and gold and silver jewelry and appliances could go to these shops to buy these exquisite goods. The prices of the goods in these shops were calculated in gold rubles and gold kopecks, and sold at pre-revolutionary market prices. Therefore, in order to help the country's construction, people who had Tsarist-era gold rubles, gold and silver jewelry, gold and silver appliances, and foreign currency were very happy to go to these shops to buy goods. As a result of adopting this business method, the Ministry of Foreign Trade accumulated funds sufficient to purchase the machine equipment for more than a dozen factories. The Soviet government specially awarded the Order of Lenin to the People's Commissar of Foreign Trade for this matter, and the Pravda newspaper also published an article to praise his achievements.

Giving full play to and utilizing the capacity of existing equipment is also an important part of thrift. During the First Five-Year Plan in the Soviet Union, factories worked day and night, and factory equipment was used day and night. At that time, not only was a three-shift work system implemented every day, but also a "continuous production system." The characteristic of this system was that workers did not have a unified day of rest, and all factories still worked as usual on Sundays. Workers took turns resting one day every six days, but the machines were running every day. This "continuous" utilization of factory equipment was an excellent method of thrift (this method was abolished after the Second Five-Year Plan due to changes in circumstances).

In addition, workers also used large-scale shock movements to overcome all difficulties in their work, creating many miracles and adding much wealth to the country.

The Soviet people's active efforts to save and increase production were for a happy and prosperous life in the future; therefore, they were completely conscious.

As a result of the Soviet people's efforts to save and work hard, the First Five-Year Plan was completed in four years and three months. In the past, the Soviet Union did not have tractor manufacturing, machine manufacturing, automobile manufacturing, or aircraft manufacturing. After these four years of effort, these heavy industries were established. Unemployment was eliminated; farmers also moved towards collectivization, fundamentally eradicating poverty in the countryside; the average wage doubled, and the material living conditions of the workers were fundamentally improved.

During the Second Five-Year Plan, thrift entered a new stage. At this time, instead of simply saving and working hard, efforts were made to improve technology. The Stakhanov movement began at this time. This movement was the highest form of socialist emulation. Its basic purpose was to improve labor productivity. In this way, the thrift movement was combined with the collective heroism of the broad masses of laborers, promoting the early completion of the Second Five-Year Plan.

During the Great Patriotic War, the Soviet people also relied on thrift to create conditions in all aspects, better ensuring the needs of the front lines, defeating the German fascist army, and winning a great victory of world historical significance.

During the Five-Year Plan for the restoration and development of the people's economy after the war, the main form of thrift was to reduce production costs.

During the years of the pre-war Five-Year Plans, the Soviet Union achieved great success in reducing industrial production costs: the First Five-Year Plan reduced production costs to 9.2 percent, and the Second Five-Year Plan reduced production costs to 10.8 percent. The Five-Year Plan after the war reduced production costs to 17 percent. At this time, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union further required socialist industrial workers to systematically improve labor productivity, reduce production costs, and improve labor organization in order to achieve greater capital accumulation.

The decisive factors in reducing production costs are: improving labor productivity, saving raw materials, materials, fuel, and electricity, and making good use of basic funds. In short, it is necessary to more effectively utilize all social labor and resources. In order to reduce production costs, tens of thousands of Stakhanovite workers, workers, technicians, and engineers put forward hundreds of millions of rationalization proposals for saving time and materials. For example, some people achieved good results by working according to time-segmented schedules; others achieved great results in strictly saving materials and fuel. Later, some people tried to unify these two methods, that is, when completing the monthly plan at the end of the month, use the materials and fuel saved this month to engage in production within the time saved this month, and the products obtained would be surplus capital accumulation. In order to encourage everyone to increase production and practice thrift, enterprises also established a bonus system.

Extensive socialist emulation plays a significant role in increasing production and practicing thrift, and it fully improves labor productivity. The annual output of each worker increased by 41 percent in the First Five-Year Plan compared to 1913; increased by 81 percent in the Second Five-Year Plan compared to 1913; and increased fivefold in the post-war Five-Year Plan compared to 1913.

The economic accounting system, which was already emphasized in the Second Five-Year Plan, was more widely promoted during the post-war Five-Year Plan period. Many production enterprises implemented this system in various links, such as workshops and sub-sections of workshops. During the post-war Five-Year Plan period, the Moscow Stalin Automobile Factory saved an extra (over-planned) capital accumulation of 150 million rubles in this way.

The thrift method of "waste utilization" was also widely promoted. This method began during the Great Patriotic War. At that time, under the slogan of "everything for the front," the national industry served the front lines, and the production of daily necessities for the people in the rear was reduced. The Soviet government then decided to develop local industries—especially production cooperatives—using old machines, using local materials, and using waste to manufacture daily necessities. Today, all cities in the Soviet Union, as large as Moscow and Leningrad, and as small as district centers and townships, are densely covered with production cooperative networks under the leadership of local Soviets. Their male and female members are people who cannot engage in strenuous work in factories and farms. The cooperative's mechanical equipment is used machinery purchased from the state at low prices; and the raw materials are non-saleable items or waste products received from large factories or enterprises at the lowest prices or free of charge. For example, sewing production cooperatives receive small pieces of cloth cut off from state-owned sewing factories; and receive large pieces of cloth that cannot be sold from state-owned weaving factories, and then the cooperative's tailors use piecing methods to cut them into children's clothes or adult clothes. For example, metal production cooperatives receive scrap iron from large factories and make household items such as kerosene lamps, kerosene stoves, small knives, and small scissors. They even select unrefined aluminum ore from the slag of large metallurgical plants, or use shavings and scraps from metal factories to re-melt and make elegant tableware such as soup bowls and spoons. They also use coal slag as fuel. Large factories cannot utilize these things. In this way, they get the practical benefit of reducing costs. Soviet cities and villages are also widely covered with organizations that collect waste, collecting waste discarded by residents to supply production cooperatives. The total funds obtained from production cooperatives in one year throughout the Soviet Union are more than hundreds of billions of rubles. The governments of the various union republics and autonomous republics have local industry departments; and the Soviets of the various states and districts have local industry departments in charge of the production cooperative business. Because this cause not only benefits the people, but also is a huge source of funds.

National thrift is of decisive significance for the development of production. If we look at the investment amounts of the successive Stalin Five-Year Plans listed below, we will know its great effect.

Investment in the First Five-Year Plan (1928 to 1933) – 64.6 billion rubles.

Investment in the Second Five-Year Plan (1933 to 1937) – 133 billion rubles.

Investment in the Third Five-Year Plan (according to the previous three-year plan, that is, 1938 to 1940) – 130 billion rubles.

Investment in the Fourth Five-Year Plan (post-war five-year plan for the restoration and development of the people's economy, 1946 to 1950) – 250 billion rubles.

Last year—1951, the Soviet Union was carrying out several great communist construction projects at the same time, and the funds needed were even more huge and unprecedented. Capital accumulation is still obtained from thrift on a national scale.

The current focus of thrift is to improve labor productivity by using advanced technology. The most prominent example here is that the Soviet Union already has automated power plants: the entire power plant is equipped with automatic machines, the factory doors are locked, and there is no one inside, and the power plant works automatically. In 1950, there was another great achievement. In Moscow, Stakhanovite workers, workers, technicians, and scholars constructed a fully automated factory for manufacturing piston parts for automobiles. This is the first fully automated factory in the world.

The great leap forward in the Soviet machine manufacturing industry is of great help to automation. In the post-war years, the number of machine tools has increased to 2.2 times due to the addition of new machines with higher productivity. In the past three years alone, the Soviet machine manufacturing industry has produced about 1,600 new types of machines and machinery. Almost all factories have replaced a complete set of new technical equipment.

In the Soviet Union, thrift is a national cause that has begun since the establishment of the Soviet regime. The Soviet Union has insisted on implementing this method, restoring and transforming the industry left by old Russia, building a socialist economy, and then engaging in great communist construction.

Under the education of the great Lenin, Stalin, and the CPSU, thrift has been deeply ingrained in the daily life habits of the people, and the power of thrift—for the welfare of the people and economic construction—has reached an incredible level in the Soviet Union! High degree of thrift, Soviet patriotic enthusiasm, and collective heroism enable the Soviet Union to move towards communist construction!

We should absorb the experience of the Soviet Union, learn from the patriotic spirit of the Soviet people, and make thrift penetrate into all aspects.

Thrift is our people's inherent virtue. At present, it must be combined with the interests of our country's freedom and independence, and combined with the future happiness of our people. Various methods should be adopted in a planned and organized manner to promote thrift and organize thrift, so that thrift becomes the living habit of our people nationwide and becomes the main lever of our country's economic construction.

    学习苏联的节约经验
    廖焕星
    学习苏联的节约经验，对于我们国家的经济建设事业有着巨大的意义。
    社会主义国家的苏联，以增产节约作为它的基本政策之一。实行第一次斯大林五年计划的第一年，我奉派到苏联去，目睹苏联当年节约建设的情形，到今天仍历历如在眼前。
    第一个五年计划的首要任务是发展重工业。这需要有大批的资金积累，改善工业装备。大批资金积累的唯一方法是：厉行节约，高度地发挥已有设备的能力，扩展社会主义竞赛。
    在第一次五年计划的岁月里，苏联人民积极地投入争取重工业巨额资金的斗争，大家都争先恐后地节衣缩食来积累资金。那时，苏联还不产茶叶，而苏联人民又酷好喝茶，但是为了杜绝现金外流，便只喝白开水或用代用品。人民节水节电成了习惯，现在许多人家中尚留有当年滴水洗脸用的设备。
    苏联政府对外贸易部在第一次五年计划时期，对于资金积累起了重大的作用。我还记得这么一件事：对外贸易部在全国各地设立了一种备有精美食品、衣服、器具的商店。凡有现金、外币以及金银首饰器具的人，都可以向这种商店去购买这些精美货物。这种商店的商品价格是用金卢布、金戈比计算，并按革命前的市价出售的。所以一般人为了帮助国家建设，凡是有沙皇时代的金卢布、金银首饰、金银器具和外币的人，都很喜欢到这种商店去购买货物。对外贸易部采取这种经营方法的结果，积累资金共计可以购置十几个工厂的机器装备。苏联政府为了这件事情，特地颁发列宁勋章给对外贸易人民委员，真理报也发表文章来赞扬他的功绩。
    发挥和利用已有的设备能力，也是节约中的一个重要环节。在苏联第一次五年计划时期，工厂日日夜夜地工作着，工厂设备日日夜夜地被利用着。当时不仅实行了每天三班工作制，而且实施了“不断生产制”。这种制度的特点是：工人没有一个统一的休息日，各工厂在星期日都仍然照常工作。工人每工作六天，轮流休息一天，但机器却天天开动。工厂设备的这种“不断”的利用，是一种极好的节约方法（这种方法到第二次五年计划后，由于情况的变化就废止了）。
    此外，工人还用巨大规模的突击运动战胜了工作中的一切困难，创造了许多奇迹，为国家增加了许多财富。
    苏联人民这样积极地节约增产，是为着将来幸福快乐的生活；所以他们是完全自觉的。
    苏联人民的努力节约和紧张工作的结果，第一次五年计划在四年零三个月就完成了。从前，苏联是没有拖拉机制造业、机器制造业、汽车制造业、飞机制造业的，经过这四年的努力，这些重工业都建立起来了。失业现象被消灭了；农民也走向集体化，根本铲除了农村的贫困现象；平均工资增加了
    一倍，工人物质生活状况根本改善了。
    在第二次五年计划期间，节约进入新阶段。这时，不再硬省硬干，而努力于改进技术。斯塔哈诺夫运动就在这时开始。这个运动是社会主义竞赛运动的最高形式。它的基本目的是要求提高劳动生产率。这样，节约运动就和广大劳动者的集体英雄主义结合起来，推动了第二个五年计划的早日完成。
    在伟大卫国战争期间，苏联人民也还依靠节约创造各方面的条件，更好地保证了前线的需要，打败了德国法西斯军队，获得了具有世界历史意义的伟大胜利。
    在战后复兴和发展人民经济的五年计划期间，节约的主要形式是降低生产成本。
    在战前各个五年计划的年代里，苏联在降低工业生产成本方面，获得了极大的成就：第一个五年计划降低生产成本到百分之九·二，第二个五年计划降低了生产成本到百分之一○·八。而战后五年计划年代降低了生产成本到百分之十七。这时，苏联共产党更加要求社会主义工业工作人员有系统地提高劳动生产率，降低生产成本，改善劳动组织，以达到更大的资金积累。
    降低生产成本的决定性的因素是：提高劳动生产率，节约原料、材料、燃料、电力，善于利用基本资金。总之要更有效地利用一切社会的劳动力和资源。为了降低生产成本，成千成万的斯塔哈诺夫式工作者：工人、技师、工程师提出了亿万个节约时间和材料的合理化建议。例如开始有些人按分刻时间日程表工作的结果，节约成绩很好；另外有些人则在严格节约材料、燃料方面有很大成绩。以后就有人想法把这两种方法统一起来，即在月底完成本月计划时，把这个月节约的材料、燃料，在本月节约的时间内从事生产，所得的产品，便是超额资金积累。为了鼓励大家增产节约，各企业还订立了奖金制度。
    广泛的社会主义竞赛，对于增产节约起着重大的作用，它充分地提高了劳动生产率。每个工人每年的生产量在第一个五年计划时比一九一三年增加了百分之四十一；第二个五年计划时比一九一三年增加了百分之八十一；战后五年计划时比一九一三年增加了五倍。
    在第二个五年计划时就已经强调的经济核算制，到战后五年计划时期更广泛地推行起来。许多生产企业，在各个环节，如车间、车间之分部等，都实行了这种制度。在战后五年计划期间，莫斯科斯大林汽车厂就这样节约出超额（超计划）资金积累一亿五千万卢布。
    “废物利用”的节约方法也被广泛推行。这种方法开始于伟大卫国战争期间。当时在“一切为了前线”的口号下，国家工业都为前线服务，后方人民日用品的生产就减少了。苏联政府便决定发展地方工业——尤其是生产合作社，利用旧机器，就地取材，利用废物来制造日用品。到了现在，苏联各城市，大如莫斯科、列宁格勒，小如区中心及乡镇，都密布着在地方苏维埃领导下的生产合作社网。它们的男女社员都是不能在工厂、农场从事紧张工作的人。合作社的机械装备，是用低价向国家购领的用过的机械；而原料则是用最低价格或无代价地向大工厂或大企业领取来的不能发售的物品或废弃品。例如缝纫生产合作社，向国营缝纫工厂领取裁剪下来的小块布；向国营织布工厂领取不能发售的大块布回来，再由合作社的剪裁师用拼凑的方法，裁成小孩衣服或成人衣服。再如五金生产合作社领取大工厂的碎片寸铁，制成煤油灯、煤油炉、小刀、小剪等家庭用品。它们甚至从大冶金厂的炉渣中选出未炼尽的铝质矿砂，或用五金工厂的刨花刨屑来再加镕炼，制成雅致的餐具如汤盆、羹匙之类的东西。它们还利用煤渣作燃料。这些东西，大工厂是无法利用的。这样它们就得到减低成本的实利。苏联的城市和乡村还广泛密布着一种收集废物的组织，收集一些居民抛弃的废物供给生产合作社。从生产合作社里一年所得的资金，全苏联总在千百亿卢布以上。各加盟共和国及自治共和国政府，都设有地方工业部；各州各区苏维埃，都有地方工业部门主管生产合作社事业。因为这项事业，不仅为人民造福，而且是巨大资金的泉源。
    全民节约对于发展生产是有决定意义的。我们看一看下面所列举的历次斯大林五年计划的投资额，就知道它的伟大功效了。
    第一次五年计划（一九二八年到一九三三年）的投资额——六百四十六亿卢布。
    第二次五年计划（一九三三年到一九三七年）的投资额——一千三百三十亿卢布。
    第三次五年计划（按前三年计划，即一九三八年到一九四○年）的投资额——一千三百亿卢布。
    第四次五年计划（战后恢复发展人民经济五年计划，一九四六年到一九五○年）的投资额—— 二千五百亿卢布。
    去年——一九五一年，苏联同时进行几个伟大的共产主义建设工程，需要的资金更巨大得史无先例。资金积累仍是在全民范围的节约中取得。
    现今的节约重心，是利用先进技术提高劳动生产率。这里最突出的例子是苏联已经有了自动机化的发电厂：整个发电厂装备着自动机，厂门下锁，内中无一人，发电厂自动工作。在一九五○年，另有一个巨大成就，在莫斯科，斯塔哈诺夫式工作者——工人、技师、学者构造成了一个全部自动机化的汽车零件活塞制造厂。这是世界上第一个全部自动机化的工厂。
    苏联机器制造工业的巨大跃进，对于自动机化有很大帮助。在战后年代中，由于补充了新的生产力更高的机器，工作母机的数量已增加到二点二倍。单在过去三年中，苏联机器制造业就生产了约一千六百种新型的机器和机械。所有工厂几乎全部换了一套新技术装备。
    节约在苏联，是自从苏维埃政权建立以来就已开端的全民事业。苏联坚持实行了这个方法，恢复和改造了旧俄遗下的工业，建成了社会主义的经济，且进而从事于伟大共产主义建设。
    苏联人民在伟大列宁、斯大林和联共的教育下，节约已经浸透在人民日常生活的习惯中，节约的力量——对人民的福利和经济的建设——在苏联已达到不可思议的地步。高度节约、苏维埃爱国主义热忱及集体英雄主义，使苏联能够向共产主义建设迈进！
    我们应该吸收苏联的经验，学习苏联人民的爱国精神，使节约深入到各方面去。
    节约本是我国人民固有的美德，目前必须使之和我们国家自由独立的利益相结合，和我国人民的未来幸福相结合，有计划地有组织地采用各种方法来促进节约和组织节约，使节约成为我全国人民的生活习惯，成为我国经济建设的主要杠杆。
