Learning from the Excellent Art of the Soviet Union
Hong Shen
Having seen the outstanding performances of prominent Soviet artists, we deeply feel that the level and achievements of the Soviet art cause are unmatched anywhere else.

Many of the Soviet artists who came to China to participate in the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month" are recipients of the Stalin Prize, and they are the artists most beloved by the Soviet people. The Soviet people sent their most outstanding artists to China to perform, which demonstrates the Soviet people's warm friendship towards the New China and their great internationalist spirit. We are deeply moved by this brotherly friendship of the Soviet people towards the Chinese people.

Our Chinese artists have undoubtedly gained many valuable lessons from the Soviet artists this time. We need to learn from Soviet artists in many areas, absorb their creative work experience, and learn their realistic attitude towards art. This is very helpful and of great significance for us to meet the task of the large-scale cultural construction upsurge that is about to unfold in our country.

The fraternal friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people is constantly growing. Now, with cooperation in politics, economy, science, and education, the exchange and cooperation between China and the Soviet Union in culture and art will surely develop greatly. The visit of Soviet artists to China to participate in the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month" activities has given the Chinese people an opportunity to learn from the excellent art of the Soviet Union, although this is only a beginning. Today, as the entire Chinese people enthusiastically participate in the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month" activities, we will more widely and deeply learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union to improve our artistic works. We will refine and elevate our rich national artistic heritage, absorb the advanced methods and ideological content of Soviet art creation, so as to make our own art blossom even more brilliantly.

    学习苏联优秀的艺术
    洪深
    看了苏联著名艺术家的卓越的演出，我们深深感到，苏维埃艺术事业所达到的水准及所获得的成就，是在任何其他地方找不到的。
    这次来中国参加“中苏友好月”的苏联艺术家中，有很多人是斯大林奖金的获得者，他们都是苏联人民所最热爱的艺术家。苏联人民派遣了他们最优秀的艺术家到中国来表演，说明了苏联人民对新中国的热烈的友情和他们伟大的国际主义精神。苏联人民对中国人民的这种兄弟般的友情深深令我们感动。
    我们中国的艺术工作者这次无疑地从苏联艺术家那里得到了许多宝贵的学问。我们在很多地方都要向苏联的艺术家学习，吸取他们的创造性的工作经验，学习他们那种实事求是的对待艺术的态度。这对于我们迎接我国即将开展的大规模的文化建设高潮的任务说来，是非常有帮助，而且有非常重要的意义的。
    中苏两国人民间的兄弟情谊正在不断地增长着。现在，随着在政治、经济、科学、教育等方面的合作，中苏两国在文化艺术方面的交流合作必将大大地发展起来。这次苏联艺术家来中国参加“中苏友好月”的活动，给中国人民一个学习苏联优秀艺术的机会，虽然这还只是一个开端。在全中国人民热烈参加“中苏友好月”活动的今天，我们将更广泛、更深入地去学习苏联的先进经验，来提高我们的艺术作品。我们将在我们民族的丰富的艺术遗产上面加工提炼，汲取苏维埃艺术创作的先进方法和思想内容，来使我们自己的艺术开出更灿烂的花朵。
