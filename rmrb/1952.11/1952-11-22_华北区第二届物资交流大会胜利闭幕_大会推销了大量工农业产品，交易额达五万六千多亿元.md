    The Second North China Materials Exchange Conference Concludes Successfully
    The Conference Promoted a Large Number of Industrial and Agricultural Products, with a Transaction Volume of Over 5.6 Trillion Yuan

    The Second North China Materials Exchange Conference, lasting fifty days, successfully concluded on November 15th. The total transaction volume of the conference reached 5,647.5 billion yuan, exceeding the planned target of 4 trillion yuan. Of the total transaction volume, industrial products accounted for 51.07 percent, and local and special products accounted for 48.93 percent. Spot transactions accounted for 11.75 percent, and contracts and agreements accounted for 88.25 percent. The trade delegations attending the conference included those from five provinces and two municipalities in North China, major administrative regions and cities across the country, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, and ethnic minority trade representatives from Xinjiang and Qinghai, who were trading with North China for the first time. There were also many small trade groups from primary markets such as special districts, counties, and towns. A total of 4,623 trade workers participated in the transactions, of which private enterprise representatives accounted for 56.35 percent. In Tianjin alone, more than 25,000 large and small industrial and commercial households participated in the conference transactions.

    The conference successfully promoted a large number of industrial and agricultural products, especially various urban industrial products, most of which were sold out. Trade delegations from various regions generally achieved their goals in purchasing industrial products. For example, the Shanxi trade delegation purchased over 109 billion yuan worth of cotton textiles, which can roughly meet the needs of farmers before the Spring Festival this year. In addition, the cultural and educational supplies purchased by the province can meet the needs of young and middle-aged people among the five million cooperative members in the province for the winter-spring literacy campaign. In order to meet the needs of farmers, the Pingyuan Province purchased over 180 billion yuan worth of goods, more than three times the original plan. Most of the general local products from various regions were sold, and especially some slow-moving local products found sales channels. For example, the native cloth, reed mats, and crude saltpeter from Hebei Province, gypsum and sulfur from Shanxi Province, and soybean oil and straw braid from Pingyuan Province were not only sold out in stock but also had some futures orders placed. The large-scale sales of these local products will have a significant impact on the lives of the broad masses of farmers. For example, the sale of more than 10,000 bundles of straw braid produced by farmers in Pingyuan Province solved the livelihood problems of 183,500 women for four months. In addition, slow-moving local products such as sugar, tung oil, rosin, and arsenic from the Central South region, as well as special products and livestock products from various ethnic minority areas, were also sold out completely or in large quantities.

    The main reason for achieving the above-mentioned results is that, under the correct leadership of the North China Administrative Committee of the Government Administration Council, the conference conscientiously implemented the transaction policy of "seeking truth from facts, taking both public and private interests into consideration, taking both large and small interests into consideration, mutual assistance between urban and rural areas, mutual assistance between regions, having both buying and selling, buying and selling more, and promoting the sales of stockpiled industrial products and general local products." Throughout the transaction process, the conference continuously criticized and overcame conservative ideas through various meetings such as trade delegation leaders' meetings and private industrial and commercial entrepreneurs' symposiums, so that the trade delegations re-calculated carefully and seriously revised their procurement plans. At the same time, the conference, through various meetings, symposiums, wall newspapers, and other publicity, implemented the pricing policy of small profits and quick turnover and taking care of the interests of production, transportation, and sales, opposed the idea of high profits, expanded regional price differences, encouraged long-distance transportation, and implemented the principle of premium prices for high-quality goods and lower prices for inferior goods, with the principle of being able to sell slow-moving goods. In addition, the conference organized many professional meetings according to regions and commodity categories, and carried out organized, planned, and large-scale centralized transactions. In the transactions, the conference adopted various flexible transaction methods, coupled with the wide participation of regional representatives, which promoted a large number of transactions. In addition, transportation, banking, insurance, taxation, postal and telecommunications departments well coordinated the exchange work of the conference, providing many convenient conditions and preferential treatment to representatives from various regions in all aspects, which also played a role in the successful completion of the conference's tasks.

    In order to continue to meet the needs of farmers for industrial products before the Spring Festival, and to continue to solve the problem of scattered stockpiled commodities that have not been completely resolved by some public and private economic entities in the city, the conference decided to temporarily merge the three exchanges of daily necessities, textiles, and hardware machinery into one large exchange, in order to receive and assist public and private trade personnel from various regions who come to Tianjin to conduct transactions one after another.

    华北区第二届物资交流大会胜利闭幕
    大会推销了大量工农业产品，交易额达五万六千多亿元
    历时五十天的华北区第二届物资交流大会，已于十一月十五日胜利闭幕。大会交易总额达五万六千四百七十五亿元，超额完成大会预定四万亿元的任务。成交额中，工业品占百分之五十一点零七，土、特产品占百分之四十八点九三；现款现货占百分之十一点七五，合同、协议占百分之八十八点二五。到会的贸易代表团，包括华北五省二市、全国各大行政区、全国各主要城市、以及内蒙古自治区和从未来华北贸易的新疆、青海等少数民族贸易代表，还有很多专区、县、镇等初级市场的小型贸易团。到会参加交易的贸易工作者共四千六百二十三人，其中仅私营企业代表就占百分之五十六点三五。仅天津市就有二万五千多大小工商户参加大会交易。
    大会成功地推销了大量的工、农业产品，特别是城市的各种工业品已大部销售出去。各地贸易团在采购工业品上，一般都达到了目的。如山西省贸易团采购的棉织品即达一千零九十多亿元，大体上能满足今年农民群众年节前的需要；又如该省采购的文教用品，可满足全省五百万合作社社员中的青壮年今冬明春速成识字运动中的需要。平原省为了满足农民需要，采购的商品达一千八百多亿元，超过原计划三倍以上。各地区的一般土产品大部推销出去，特别是有些滞销的土产品都打开销路，如河北省的土布、苇席、皮硝，山西省的石膏、硫磺，平原省的豆油、草帽辫，不但销完了现货，并有一部订了期货。这些土产品大量销出之后，对广大农民生活将起着重大的影响，如平原省农民生产的草帽辫一万多包推销后，便解决了十八万三千五百个妇女四个月的生活问题。此外，中南区的糖、桐油、松香、信石等滞销土产品和各少数民族地区的特产、畜产品等，也都全部或大部销出。
    取得上述成绩的主要原因，是由于大会在政务院华北行政委员会的正确领导下，认真贯彻了“实事求是，公私兼顾，大小兼顾，城乡互助，地区互助，有买有卖，多买多卖，推销积压工业品及一般土产品”的交易方针。大会在自始至终的交易过程中，不断地通过各贸易团团长会议、私营工商业者座谈会等各种会议，批判和克服保守思想，各贸易团才从新精打细算，认真修正采购计划。同时，大会通过各种会议、座谈、壁报等宣传，贯彻了薄利广销和照顾产、运、销三者利益的价格政策，反对高额利润思想，扩大地区差价，鼓励长途贩运，实行优货优价、劣货劣价，对滞销货以能销出为原则。另外，大会按地区和商品分类组织了很多专业会议，有组织地、有计划地、大规模地集中成交。在成交中，大会采取了各种灵活的交易方式，加以地区代表的广泛性，所以便促成了大量的成交。此外，运输、银行、保险、税收、邮电等部门很好地配合了大会的交流工作，在各方面给各地代表很多方便条件和优待，对于大会胜利地完成任务也起了作用。
    大会为继续满足农民年节前对工业品的需要，和继续解决城市某些公私经济单位尚没有完全解决的零星积压商品，决定暂时把日用百货、纺织、五金机器三交易所合并为一个大交易所，以便接待和协助陆续来天津的各地公私营贸易人员进行交易。
