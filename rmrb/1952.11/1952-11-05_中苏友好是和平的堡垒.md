    Sino-Soviet Friendship is a Bastion of Peace
    Song Qingling
    It has been thirty-five years since the Soviet people declared to the world the establishment of the first country founded on the belief in peace to ensure the richest life for mankind.
    During these thirty-five years, the Chinese people have also been engaged in arduous struggles, finally achieving a victorious liberation from oppression and suffering. Now, we have established a country that puts the people first and is based on peace.
    Therefore, the people of China and the Soviet Union are closely linked, especially with regard to the policy of international friendship and cooperation, which is strong and completely consistent. Our relationship sets an example. That is, we sincerely respect each other, help each other for mutual benefit, and unswervingly defend peace. In this spirit, we signed and implemented the 1950 Sino-Soviet Treaty. In this spirit, we also signed the 1952 Sino-Soviet Agreement. In this spirit, we regularly conduct trade and cultural exchanges. From the various aspects of our relationship, it is not difficult to see how our two countries get along.
    Facts show that in the eyes of the broad masses of people, China and the Soviet Union are pursuing a policy of maintaining world peace. Both of our countries are engaged in great construction projects, and many large-scale plans are about to be finalized. We are determined not to allow these projects and plans to be hindered in any way. We are determined to continue to create our future under any circumstances. Of course, we want to accomplish this task in a peaceful environment. For us, peace means completing our plans ahead of schedule, so that our people and the people of friendly countries can enjoy a better life, the sooner the better.
    The people of China and the Soviet Union recognize that the meaning of life is peace and love. We will never have thoughts or actions that violate this understanding. War conspiracies are simply incompatible with our way of life, and of course, with our highest interests. We are also always ready to defend our motherland and defend peace. Our vigilance is never relaxed. The shameful conspiracies of certain governments against us have been fully exposed. Under these circumstances, we continue to work for peace and further strengthen our peaceful construction.
    China and the Soviet Union firmly believe in peace with the same confidence that they have in their own people and in the friendship between them, and therefore have the same confidence in the people of other countries in the world. We believe that they have the conscience and ability to judge that peace can guarantee their future, and that war will create disasters for mankind, even if the war is still remote in time or distance. With this confidence in the people, it is not difficult to clearly distinguish between the small handful of warmongers and the vast majority of war victims. We will always extend our hand of goodwill and friendship to the people of all countries. The people all over the world, in view of our policy of respecting human rights and maintaining peace, warmly shake hands with us.
    Under the wise leadership of our great leaders, the people of China and the Soviet Union are constantly progressing. Our fraternal friendship will also be strengthened, and the bastion of peace and the cornerstone of human prosperity and happiness will also be more solid.

    中苏友好是和平的堡垒
    宋庆龄
    自从苏联人民向全世界宣告建立了第一个以和平信念为基础来保障人类最丰富的生活的国家以来，已经有三十五年了。
    就是在这三十五年中，中国人民也进行着艰苦的斗争，终于在胜利地从压迫和苦难中解放出来。现在，我们建立了一个以人民为至上、和平为基础的国家。
    因此，中苏两国的人民是息息相关的，特别是对于国际友好合作的方针是坚强而完全一致的。我们相互间的关系树立了一个榜样。那就是彼此竭诚尊重，互助互利，毫不动摇地保卫和平。本着这种精神我们签订并实施一九五○年的中苏条约。本着这种精神我们又签订了一九五二年的中苏协定。本着这种精神我们经常进行贸易与文化交流。从我们之间的各种关系就不难看到我们两国是怎样相处的。
    事实说明，在广大人民的心目中，中苏两国采取维护世界和平的政策。我们两国都进行着伟大的建设工程，许多规模宏大的计划亦将近拟就。我们决不愿使这些工程和计划受到任何阻碍。我们决心在任何情况下继续创造我们的未来。当然，我们要在和平的环境中完成这个任务。对我们来说，和平意味着提前完成计划，使我们人民和友邦人民能够享受美好的生活，愈早愈好。
    中苏两国的人民认识到生活的意义是和平与友爱。我们决不会有违反这种认识的思想和行为。战争阴谋简直与我们的生活方式相抵触，当然也就与我们的最高利益相抵触。我们也时刻准备着保卫我们的祖国，保卫和平。我们的警备从不松弛。某些政府针对我们的可耻的阴谋已暴露无遗。在这种情况之下，我们依旧继续为和平而努力，并更加加强我们的和平建设。
    中苏两国以信任他们自己的人民和彼此间友谊的那样信心来坚信和平，所以对世界其他各国的人民也怀有同样的信心。我们相信他们具有良知和能力来判断，和平才能保障他们的未来，战争就会给人类制造灾难，即使战争在时间或距离上还是遥远的。有了对人民的这种信心，就不难明确地分清制造战争的一小撮人和广大的战争受难者。我们永远向各国人民伸出善意与友谊的手。世界各地的人民，鉴于我们尊重人权与维护和平的方针，都和我们亲切地握手。
    中苏两国人民在伟大领袖们英明的领导下不断地进步。我们兄弟般的友谊同时将愈益加强，而和平的堡垒与人类繁荣和幸福的基石亦将愈益坚固。    一九五二年十月二十五日于北京
