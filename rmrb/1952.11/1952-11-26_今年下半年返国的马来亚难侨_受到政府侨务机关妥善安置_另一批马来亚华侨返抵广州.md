Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 21st -- The 16th to 21st groups of Malayan refugees, totaling 3,952 people, who were unreasonably expelled by the British colonial authorities and returned to China in the second half of 1952, have received the warm care and proper resettlement from the People's Government Overseas Chinese Affairs agencies. When the refugees first returned to their motherland, they were mostly penniless and physically weak. From the first day they arrived in Guangzhou, the People's Government Overseas Chinese Affairs agencies extended a warm welcome and reception to them, sending people to the ships to express their condolences, taking them to reception centers, distributing clothes and bedding, and issuing each person 900,000 yuan as a "settlement allowance." According to the refugees' wishes, the People's Government has subsidized them to return to their hometowns for production, or introduced them to work or study. Up to now, among these six groups of returned refugees, more than 2,200 people have been subsidized to return to their hometowns for production, more than 900 people have been introduced to work in the Wanqingsha Overseas Chinese Collective Farm in Dongguan, Guangdong, the Xinglong Overseas Chinese Collective Farm in Hainan Island, the Zhangzhou Overseas Chinese Collective Farm in Fujian, etc., and 24 people have been introduced to study. The remaining are mostly the elderly, the weak, and the sick, who have also been placed in nursing homes and other places in Guangzhou, or introduced to hospitals for treatment.

The refugees who have returned to their hometowns for production or have participated in work or study have expressed their heartfelt gratitude for the proper resettlement provided by the People's Government. Many refugees frequently write letters to the Overseas Chinese Affairs agencies to report on their happy lives and work.

Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 21st -- The 22nd group of Malayan refugees, numbering 626, who were unreasonably expelled by the British colonial authorities, arrived in Guangzhou on the morning of the 19th. Most of them are women, the elderly, and the weak. Before being expelled, they were imprisoned in concentration camps and prisons in Ipoh, Klang, Kluang, Johor Bahru, Taiping, Penang, Kuala Lumpur, and other places, where they suffered cruel torture and abuse by the British colonialists; many of them were imprisoned for three or four years. After returning to Guangzhou, these refugees received a warm welcome and reception from the People's Government Overseas Chinese Affairs agencies.

Prior to this, the 20th group of 650 Malayan refugees and the 21st group of 650 Malayan refugees, who were expelled by the British colonial authorities, had successively returned to Guangzhou on September 24th and October 12th. To date, since 1950, the number of Malayan refugees expelled by the British colonial authorities has reached 14,440.

    【新华社广州二十一日电】一九五二年下半年遭受英国殖民当局无理驱逐回国的马来亚难侨第十六批到第二十一批三千九百五十二人，已得到人民政府侨务机关的亲切照顾和妥善安置。难侨们初回到祖国时，大都一贫如洗，身体瘦弱。人民政府侨务机关从他们来到广州第一天起，就予以亲切的欢迎和招待，派人到船上去慰问他们，把他们接到招待所里，发给他们衣服和被帐，并发给每人九十万元的“安家费”。根据难侨们的志愿，人民政府已将他们分别资送回乡生产或介绍工作、学习。到目前为止，这六批回国难侨中，资遣回乡生产的有二千二百多人，介绍到广东东莞万顷沙华侨集体农场、海南岛兴隆华侨集体农场、福建漳州华侨集体农场等处工作的有九百多人，介绍学习的有二十四人。剩下的大都是老弱和有病的人，也被安插到广州养老院等处或介绍到医院治病。
    已经回乡生产或参加工作、学习的难侨们，对于人民政府对他们的妥善安置，都表示衷心的感谢。很多难侨经常写信给侨务机关报告他们愉快的生活和工作的情况。
