Recently, many British newspapers published a photograph: Hitler's aircraft designer, Henkel, calmly observed the British aircraft's air show at Farnborough with binoculars and a camera. How could such a person, whose planes had frantically bombed British cities ten years ago, causing the deaths of women and children, appear in Britain? When people inquired about this matter, representatives from the British Foreign Office, Air Force Department, Home Office, and the Air Show Organizing Committee pretended as if Henkel's visit had nothing to do with them.

A journalist from a British bourgeois newspaper sarcastically said, "So, perhaps the Americans invited Henkel here."

This is a sharp irony.

Everyone can learn from newspaper reports that Henkel came to Britain to study superior British military aircraft in order to prepare for their manufacture in West Germany for the West German war machine fostered by US-British imperialism. The British bourgeois newspaper "Daily Express" wrote about this: "This news must shock everyone. Can we, who have tasted enough of Henkel and his ilk, endorse the resumption of German fighter and bomber production?"

The events that occur every day prove that the American policy, supported by the British ruling group, aimed at reviving German militarism, is increasingly turning against Britain itself. US imperialism is turning West Germany into an arsenal for preparing for a new war. The United States does this not only from a military-strategic point of view but also from an economic one. American capitalists, closely colluding with the capitalists of the Bonn puppet republic, are using the West German monopoly capital they control to attack the economic positions of British competitors. It is noteworthy that the British bourgeois newspaper "Sunday Times" depressingly confessed that one of the main reasons for the sharp deterioration of the British economic situation is that it is again breathing the "cold air of revived German and Japanese competition."

Facts prove that West German monopoly capitalists, manipulated and supported by American capitalists, have a more special position compared to British monopoly capitalists. When signing contracts with countries controlled by the United States, West German capitalists are often given priority over the British. At the same time, under the cruel occupation, West German monopoly capitalists have intensified their exploitation of the working class, which makes it possible to reduce the prices of exported goods. Finally—the "Financial Times" complained that West German companies, in order to seize foreign markets, do not hesitate to dump goods at low prices.

It is therefore not surprising that West German monopoly capitalists, supported and manipulated by American capitalists, are squeezing out British capitalists in the world market. According to official materials, from 1949 to the end of 1951, West Germany's exports increased by about 209 percent, while Britain's exports increased by only 10.6 percent. In terms of value, West Germany's exports in 1949 were equivalent to one-sixth of Britain's exports, while in 1951 they were almost equal to half of Britain's exports. This year, West Germany's exports have expanded even more rapidly. In terms of value, West Germany's exports in the first half of 1952 increased by 29 percent compared to the same period last year, while in this half year, Britain's exports increased by only 9 to 10 percent. The intensity of the West German monopoly capital's attack can be seen from the export figures for machinery manufacturing and electrical industry products: Britain's exports of these products increased by 28 percent from 1949 to 1951, while West Germany's increased by 614 percent!

The "Financial Times" said sadly: "West Germany has surpassed Britain in European trade. Now the European market absorbs 70 percent of West Germany's total exports. Britain's trade with the Netherlands, Belgium, France, Sweden, and Switzerland has declined, while West Germany's trade with these countries has grown rapidly. West German companies' automobile exports have overtaken British competitors in the markets of Belgium, the Netherlands, France, Italy, Spain, Switzerland, and other countries. British companies have lost orders from Scandinavian countries due to unfavorable payment and delivery terms, while West German companies have won their orders."

Currently, West Germany is one of the creditors of the European Payments Union, through which Western European countries settle trade debts. In July of this year, West Germany had a surplus of $57.7 million in the Payments Union account, while Britain had a deficit of $98 million, becoming the largest debtor in the Payments Union.

West German monopoly capitalists have launched a large-scale attack on British economic positions in Latin America. British exports to Latin American countries increased by only 6 percent from 1950 to 1951, while West Germany's increased by 142 percent. West Germany has concluded favorable trade agreements with many Latin American countries, selling them electrical equipment, agricultural machinery, and transportation equipment, which are the main parts of British exports.

Britain is particularly uneasy about the fact that West German trusts, manipulated by American capital, are rapidly encroaching on the traditional British markets of the Near East, Middle East, and the British Empire.

For example, in 1948, British goods accounted for 24 percent of Turkey's imports, while West Germany accounted for only 0.7 percent. By 1951, the proportion of British goods in Turkey's imports had fallen to 17 percent, while West Germany had increased to 24 percent, mainly supplying Turkey with steel, pig iron, machinery manufacturing, and chemical industry products. The German-Turkish agreement on guaranteeing the rights of German companies in Turkey was also re-enacted in 1952.

West German monopoly capitalists are also vigorously advancing into Egypt, Iran, Iraq, and other Near Eastern countries.

Finally, West German monopoly capitalists have also broken into the scope of the British Commonwealth, squeezing out British merchants in their own home. In 1951, West Germany's exports to the Sterling Area countries almost doubled (in terms of value) compared to 1950. The trade agreement concluded between West Germany and India at the beginning of 1952 opened the way for West German goods to penetrate the Indian market. West Germany's exports to Pakistan and the Union of South Africa are also expanding. Australia, New Zealand, and Canada are increasingly preferring to place orders with West Germany rather than with Britain because West German companies are offering more favorable terms.

The "Financial Times" complained: "From Scandinavia to Nicaragua, the markets of British entrepreneurs are gradually falling into the hands of foreigners... West German competition is increasing day by day, and if Britain does not improve in terms of price, payment, and delivery time, many markets in Latin America and the Near East may be lost."

In order to resist the offensive of West German monopoly capital, the British ruling group is trying its best to exert pressure on some countries, especially its Commonwealth countries, to stop them from expanding trade with West Germany. At the same time, measures such as strengthening the exploitation of the British working people and "freezing" wages are implemented to "reduce the price" of British exports.

The intensification of infighting among imperialist plunderers within the US-British aggressive bloc has recently become particularly evident, and the role played by West Germany, which has become an American protectorate, is becoming increasingly significant. The so-called "European Coal and Steel Community" established under Washington's instructions and the "European Army" being prepared are aimed at establishing a military-economic bloc subordinate to the United States, consisting of the West European continental countries of West Germany, France, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg. It is noteworthy that this "Little Europe," which American newspapers call a cosmopolitan alliance, will be the main pillar of the American ruling group on this side of the Atlantic, and the main role in it will be played by West Germany.

London is very clear that the spearhead of this military-economic group is not only directed towards the East, as the pro-American newspapers openly declare, but also towards Britain, but American propaganda obviously takes into account that it is best not to mention this for the time being.

It is well known that the British ruling group has refused to directly participate in the "European Army" and the Coal and Steel Community, but at the same time, it has promised to support the "European Army" and recently sent a special delegation as Britain's representative in the central organs of the "European Coal and Steel Community."

British bourgeois newspapers, when talking about Britain's position on this issue, say that if Britain directly participates in the West European military-economic bloc established according to American plans, it will inevitably make Britain more dependent on the United States. On the other hand, British monopoly capital is afraid of being isolated in front of a powerful continental super-cartel led by West German competitors. Therefore, British merchants are trying to "avoid trouble and reap the benefits," intending to participate in the management of the affairs of "Little Europe," but unwilling to put their heavy industry and their army into the "big pot."

It is significant that, in addition to the above, British bourgeois newspapers frequently attack the plans to establish "Little Europe," saying that these plans directly threaten British economic positions. The "Scotsman" asked: "If the Schuman Plan succeeds, what will be the result for Britain?" The newspaper then answered itself: "The participating countries of the Schuman Plan will inevitably become more fierce competitors." The newspaper reminded that all restrictions on the production of West German steel have been lifted, and the production of West German steel is constantly increasing. The "Scotsman" pointed out that since Britain is not a member of the "European Coal and Steel Community," the participants of the "European Coal and Steel Community" will not pay attention to Britain.

The anxiety expressed by the British bourgeois newspapers about the increasingly fierce competition from West German monopoly capital reflects the difficult situation Britain finds itself in after embarking on a path of consistently supporting the aggressive plans of US imperialism. Not long ago, I had a conversation with a well-known British Labor Party commentator, and when talking about the consequences of the British ruling group's policy on the German issue, he said: "Britain's position is absolutely not unexpected. This is the consequence of our short-sightedness and unwillingness to see things clearly. When we saw Soviet newspapers talking about the danger of the revival of German militarism two or three years ago, we always said: This is 'propaganda'. Today we have to face the facts, and these facts are unfavorable to us. What is right is always right!"

### 英国与西德垄断资本的竞争

    英国与西德垄断资本的竞争
    苏联  马耶夫斯基
    近来许多英国报纸刊登了一幅照片：希特勒的飞机设计师汉克尔，带着望远镜与摄影机，在法恩堡安然观望英国飞机的空中检阅。他的飞机十年前曾经疯狂地轰炸过英国的城市，使妇女与孩子们死亡，这样一个人怎么会出现在英国呢？人们追问到这件事，英国外交部、空军部、内政部以及检阅组织委员会的代表们就装作好像跟汉克尔的访问没有丝毫关系似的。
    英国资产阶级报纸的一位记者以讽刺的口吻说：“这么说来，请汉克尔到这儿来的或许是美国人。”
    这是辛辣的讽刺。
    大家从报纸上的报道中可以知道，汉克尔到英国来研究优等的英国军用飞机，以便在西德准备制造这些飞机，以供美英帝国主义扶植起来的西德战争机器之用。英国资产阶级报纸“每日快报”就这件事写道：“这个消息一定使每个人为之震惊。难道我们这些尝够了汉克尔之流的滋味的人，会赞同恢复德国驱逐机和轰炸机的生产吗？”
    每一天不断发生的事情证明，英国统治集团所支持的、旨在复活德国军国主义的美国政策，日渐转向反对英国本身。美帝国主义正在把西德变为准备新战争的兵工厂。美国这样做，不仅是从军事战略的观点着眼，而且也是从经济观点着眼。和波恩傀儡共和国资本家紧密勾结的美国资本家利用他们控制的西德垄断资本进攻英国竞争者的经济阵地。值得注意的是：英国资产阶级报纸“星期日泰晤士报”沮丧地供认，英国经济状况急剧恶化的主要原因之一，是它又呼吸到了“复活了的德、日竞争的冷气”。
    事实证明，美国资本家所操纵与支持的西德垄断资本家与英国垄断资本家相比，有着更特殊的地位。在与美国控制的国家签订合同的时候，西德资本家常常比英国人先获得照顾。同时，西德垄断资本家在残酷的占领统治下，更加紧了对工人阶级的剥削，这就使得出口商品的价格可以减低。最后——“金融时报”抱怨说，西德公司为了夺取国外市场，竟不惜廉价倾销货物。
    这样看来，美国资本家支持与操纵的西德垄断资本家在世界市场上排挤着英国资本家，也就不足为奇了。根据官方的材料，从一九四九年到一九五一年年底，西德的输出约增加了百分之二百零九，而英国的输出只增加了百分之十点六。如果以价值计算，一九四九年西德的输出相当于英国输出的六分之一，而一九五一年就差不多等于英国输出的一半。今年，西德输出额更迅速扩大。以价值计算，西德一九五二年上半年的输出比去年同一时期增加百分之二十九，而在这半年英国的输出只增加了百分之九至十。西德垄断资本进攻的强度可以从机器制造业与电气工业产品输出的数字中看出来：英国这些产品的输出在一九五一年比一九四九年增加了百分之二十八，而西德却增加了百分之六百一十四！
    “金融时报”悲哀地说：“西德在欧洲的贸易中已经超过英国了。现在欧洲市场吸收着西德输出总额的百分之七十。英国对荷兰、比利时、法国、瑞典、瑞士各国的贸易下降了，而西德对这些国家的贸易却迅速增长。西德公司的汽车输出，在比利时、荷兰、法国、意大利、西班牙、瑞士与其他国家的市场上，已经追过了英国竞争者。英国公司由于付款与交货期限的条件不利，失去了斯堪的纳维亚国家的定货，而西德公司获得了它们的定货。”
    目前，西德是欧洲支付同盟的债主之一，西欧各国通过欧洲支付同盟来清算贸易债务。今年七月，西德在支付同盟的账上有五千七百七十万美元的结存，而英国却亏空了九千八百万美元，成为支付同盟最大的债户。
    西德的垄断资本家对拉丁美洲的英国经济阵地展开大规模的进攻。英国对拉丁美洲国家的输出在一九五一年比一九五○年只增加了百分之六，而西德却增加了百分之一百四十二。西德与许多拉丁美洲国家缔结了有利的贸易协定，卖给它们电气设备、农业机器、运输工具，而这些正是英国输出的主要部分。
    英国感到特别不安的是：美国资本操纵的西德托辣斯迅速侵入到近东、中东与不列颠帝国国家这些传统的英国市场中。
    譬如，在一九四八年土耳其的输入中，英国货占百分之二十四，而西德仅占百分之零点七。到一九五一年，在土耳其的输入中，英国货的比重降到百分之十七，而西德增加到百分之二十四，其中主要是供应土耳其钢、铣铁、机器制造业与化学工业的产品。一九五二年关于保障德国公司在土耳其的权利的德土协定又重新生效。
    西德的垄断资本家同时也大力向埃及、伊朗、伊拉克与其他近东国家推进。
    最后，西德垄断资本家还冲入英国自治领的范围，在英国家里排挤起英国商人来了。一九五一年西德对英镑区各国的输出比一九五○年几乎增加到一倍半（以价值计算）。一九五二年初西德与印度缔结的贸易协定为西德货物渗入印度市场开辟了道路。西德对巴基斯坦，南非联邦的输出也日益扩大。澳大利亚、新西兰、加拿大宁愿向西德定货，而不愿向英国定货，这种情形越来越多了，因为西德公司提出的条件更有利。
    “金融时报”抱怨说：“从斯堪的纳维亚到尼加拉瓜，英国企业家的市场逐渐落到外国人手中。……西德的竞争与日俱增，假如英国不在价格、交款、交货期限等方面改善的话，拉丁美洲与近东的许多市场也许都会失掉的。”
    英国统治集团为了抵御西德垄断资本的进攻，竭力对一些国家，首先是对它的自治领施行压力，以制止它们扩大对西德的贸易。同时实行用加强对英国劳动人民的剥削、“冻结”工资等办法，便以使英国输出品“减价”。
    美英侵略集团内部帝国主义掠夺者内哄的尖锐化最近表现得特别明显，已变为美国保护国的西德所起的作用也日益显著。在华盛顿授意下成立的所谓“欧洲煤钢联营”与准备组织的“欧洲军”，目的在于建立一个隶属于美国的军事经济集团，这个集团由西德、法国、意大利、比利时、荷兰、卢森堡诸西欧大陆国家组成。值得注意的是：美国报纸称作世界主义联合的这个“小欧洲”，将是美国统治集团在大西洋此岸的主要支柱，而其中主要的角色将由西德扮演。
    伦敦十分清楚，这个军事经济集团的矛头不仅如亲美报纸所公开宣称的，是指向东方，而且还指向英国，不过美国的宣传显然考虑到，这一点目前还是不讲出来为妙。
    大家知道，英国统治集团拒绝直接参加“欧洲军”与煤钢联营，但同时它又答应支持“欧洲军”，而且不久前派了特别代表团，作为英国在“欧洲煤钢联营”的中央机关中的代表。
    英国资产阶级报纸在谈到英国对这个问题的立场时说，如果英国直接参加按照美国的计划建立的西欧军事经济集团，必然使得英国更加依赖于美国。另一方面，英国垄断经济害怕在西德竞争者领导的、强大的大陆超卡特尔面前陷于孤立。因此，英国商人企图“不惹是非，坐收其利”，他们打算参与管理“小欧洲”的事务，可是又不愿意把自己的重工业和自己的军队放到“大锅”里去。
    意味深长的是：除了上面所说的以外，英国资产阶级报纸还经常攻击建立“小欧洲”的计划，说这些计划使英国经济阵地受到直接的威胁。“苏格兰人报”问道：“要是舒曼计划成功了，对英国会有什么结果呢？”该报接着自己作答说：“舒曼计划的参加国必将成为更厉害的竞争者。”该报提醒说，对西德钢的生产的一切限制都已取消，西德钢的生产正不断地增加着。“苏格兰人报”指出，既然英国不是“欧洲煤钢联营”的一员，“欧洲煤钢联营”的参加者将不会理会英国。
    英国资产阶级报纸对于西德垄断资本日益加剧的竞争所表现的惴惴不安的情形，反映了英国走上一贯支持美帝国主义侵略计划的道路后所处的难堪的境地。不久前，我曾和一个著名的英国工党政论家交谈过，在谈到英国统治集团对德国问题的政策的后果时，他说：“英国所处的地位绝对不是出人意料的。这是我们目光短小和不愿意清醒地看事物的后果。当两三年前，我们看到苏联报纸论及德国军国主义复活的危险的时候，我们老是说：这是‘宣传’。今天我们不得不面对事实了，而这些事实是于我们不利的。对的总是对的！”
