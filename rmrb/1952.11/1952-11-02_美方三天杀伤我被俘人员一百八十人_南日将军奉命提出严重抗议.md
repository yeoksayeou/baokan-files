    Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 1st: In the three consecutive days of October 28th, 29th, and 30th, serious incidents of mass killings of our captured personnel occurred again in the U.S. side's prisoner-of-war camps on Geoje Island and Jeju Island, resulting in 180 deaths and injuries among our captured personnel. General Nam Il, the chief representative of our delegation to the Korean Armistice Negotiations, was ordered on November 1st to lodge a serious protest with the other side. The full text of the protest is as follows: To Lieutenant General Harrison, Chief Representative of the United Nations Command Delegation:
    For three consecutive days, October 28th, 29th, and 30th, your side massacred our captured personnel in batches, resulting in a total of 180 deaths and injuries. I am ordered to lodge a serious protest with your side against this grave and bloody war crime. Since October, your side has publicly admitted to killing and wounding 486 of our captured personnel, creating a shocking record of your massacre of prisoners of war. Your side irrationally suspends the armistice negotiations on the one hand, and intensifies the massacre of prisoners of war on the other. These two things are by no means accidental coincidences. This series of bloody massacre events thoroughly proves the bankruptcy of your side's claim to detain prisoners of war and shows your side's determination to sabotage the armistice negotiations and conspire to expand the Korean War. Your spokesmen hypocritically publicized your so-called "humanitarian principles" in treating prisoners of war at the United Nations General Assembly, but remained silent about the bloody facts of your massacre of prisoners of war. There can be no humanitarian principles in the world that involve massacring and detaining prisoners of war. Your side's bankruptcy in the eyes of the world's people is beyond redemption. Civilized humanity will never allow your side to be barbaric to the end. Your side must bear the historical responsibility for massacring and detaining prisoners of war, sabotaging the armistice negotiations, and plotting to expand the Korean War.
    General Nam Il, Chief Representative of the
    Korean People's Army and Chinese People's
    Volunteer Army Delegation
    November 1, 1952

    美方三天杀伤我被俘人员一百八十人
    南日将军奉命提出严重抗议
    【新华社开城一日电】在十月二十八日、二十九日、三十日三天之内，美方巨济岛和济州岛战俘营中又连续发生大批屠杀我方被俘人员的严重事件，打死打伤我方被俘人员一百八十人。朝鲜停战谈判我方代表团首席代表南日将军在十一月一日，奉命向对方提出严重抗议。抗议全文如下：联合国军代表团首席代表哈利逊中将：
    十月二十八日、二十九日、三十日连续三天，你方成批屠杀我方被俘人员，以致总共死伤一百八十人。对此次严重的血腥战争罪行，我奉命向你方提出严重抗议。十月以来，你方已公开承认打死打伤我方被俘人员四百八十六名，造成你方屠杀战俘的骇人听闻的记录。你方一面无理中止停战谈判，一面加紧屠杀战俘，这两件事绝不是偶然的巧合。这一系列血腥屠杀事件，彻底证明你方扣留战俘主张的破产，并显示你方决心破坏停战谈判，阴谋扩大朝鲜战争。你方发言人在联合国大会伪善地宣传你方对待战俘的所谓“人道原则”，但对你方屠杀战俘的血腥事实却缄口不言。世界上不可能有屠杀和扣留战俘的人道原则。你方在世界人民面前的破产是无可挽救的。文明的人类绝不容许你方野蛮到底。你方必须负起屠杀和扣留战俘，破坏停战谈判，阴谋扩大朝鲜战争的历史责任。
    朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军
    代表团首席代表南日将军
    一九五二年十一月一日
