Units such as the Southwest Military Region have also formed special institutions to lead the work of "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month" to be responsible for leading the daily work of "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month."
    During "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month," a wave of learning from Soviet internationalism and patriotism, and learning from the advanced military science of the Soviet army will be set off in various units. The General Political Department of the People's Revolutionary Military Commission distributed 60,000 copies of the 43rd issue of People's Weekly to various units so that the entire army could earnestly study Comrade Stalin's speech and Comrade Malenkov's report at the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. Various units will universally organize report meetings, seminars, and discussion meetings. At the report meetings, unit leaders will make special reports, and combat heroes and representatives who have visited the Soviet Union will be invited to report on their impressions and feelings about visiting the Soviet Union. The wired broadcasting stations and radio stations of various units have begun to broadcast and listen to the Sino-Soviet friendship programs of the Central People's Broadcasting Station. Some units are also preparing to use their own wired broadcasting stations to broadcast "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month" study materials to their subordinate units. The libraries of various units have ordered a large number of Soviet books and newspapers for everyone to study.
    The newspapers and magazines of various units will publish commemorative special issues. Various units have also printed a large number of pictures about Soviet socialist construction for exhibitions. The vast number of soldiers whose cultural level has rapidly improved in cultural studies have actively written commemorative articles for their blackboards and wall newspapers. The company clubs of various units have been decorated very beautifully. The soldiers of various units of the East China Military Region have happily decorated their company clubs into "Sino-Soviet Friendship Rooms," with various pictures and illustrations introducing Soviet construction and Soviet heroes posted inside. The cultural work troupes (teams) of various units have actively rehearsed various Sino-Soviet friendship programs, and cultural workers have gone deep into the companies to help organize programs to be performed during Sino-Soviet Friendship Month.
