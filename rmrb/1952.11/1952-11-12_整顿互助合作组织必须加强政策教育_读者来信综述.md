    Strengthening Policy Education is Essential for Rectifying Mutual Aid and Cooperation Organizations

    This year, mutual aid and cooperation movements in various regions have experienced significant development. However, due to some rural cadres lacking understanding and research into the guidelines and policies of mutual aid and cooperation, and not clearly understanding the direction of rural economic development, many problems have also arisen in the mutual aid and cooperation movement. Many reader letters suggest that various regions should pay attention to the following issues when rectifying mutual aid and cooperation organizations this winter:

    First, strengthen education on mutual aid and cooperation policies and the future of rural economic development for rural cadres and the broad masses of farmers. This year, in some areas, leading organs have not conducted this kind of education effectively, leading to tendencies of coercion and formalism in the mutual aid and cooperation movement. Readers Cheng Zhentao and Xue Youmei wrote that Huang Qingtong, a township instructor in Wanwei Township, Gaogou District, Lianshui County, Northern Jiangsu, did not attach importance to leading production mutual aid. The leadership did not conduct ideological education for him and simply removed him from his post. In this way, although township and village cadres "attached importance" to production mutual aid, a style of coercion emerged. Some cadres said to the masses, "Look, the township instructor was dismissed because he was not active in mutual aid production work. Can you afford not to participate in mutual aid?" Cadres and party members in Wanwei Township do not recognize mutual aid and cooperation as the direction of rural economic development. Only seven of the fifteen township branch committee members participated in mutual aid teams, and only forty-nine of the sixty-eight party members in the township participated in mutual aid teams, but most were just going through the motions. They believe that this is what the higher authorities want them to do, and they have no choice but to participate. Readers Wang Dewen and Qu Keluan wrote that cadres in Xiguan Village, Kunyu County, Shandong, did not clearly explain the mutual aid policy to the masses and forced them to organize. Deputy Township Chief Wang Changfa said to the masses, "Anyone who does not participate in the mutual aid team is a sharp-headed element who wants to take the road of landlords and rich peasants." They also ordered militiamen to stand guard and patrol, and anyone who did not participate in the mutual aid team was not allowed to leave the village.

    Second, check whether there are exploitative phenomena within the mutual aid teams and whether the principle of equivalent exchange and mutual benefit has been implemented. Reader Chenguang wrote that cadres in Yandian Township, Suzhou County, Anhui, did not adequately publicize and explain the mutual aid policy, and many counter-revolutionaries, landlords, and rich peasants had infiltrated the mutual aid teams. In Yandian Township, there are more than thirty landlords and rich peasants whose class status has not been changed, and more than twenty of them have joined the mutual aid teams, continuing to exploit the peasants within the teams. In the mutual aid team directly managed by Township Instructor Zhu Mingli, there was a rich peasant named Wang Sigong who did not participate in labor himself. His two daughters participated in some light work, and he still earned more than twenty catties of wage rice when settling accounts. Reader Shuangquan wrote that Zhou Mahong, the leader of the Shizhuang mutual aid team in the Second District of Nanhe County, Hebei Province, often did not participate in labor, spending three days going to market and two days attending meetings (referring to temple fairs). When there was a drought, he rushed to water his own land first, and when it rained, he rushed to weed his own land first, resulting in the collapse of the mutual aid team. Some readers have reported that many mutual aid teams, after being established, do not record work points or settle accounts; some wages are set too low, and even if work points are recorded and accounts are settled, it is not fair.

    The problems reflected by the readers above, some have been inspected and resolved, and some have not yet been resolved. Readers unanimously suggest that all regions should pay special attention to these issues when rectifying mutual aid and cooperation organizations.

### 整顿互助合作组织必须加强政策教育——读者来信综述

    整顿互助合作组织必须加强政策教育
    ——读者来信综述
    今年各地的互助合作运动都有很大的发展，但是因为某些农村干部对互助合作的方针、政策缺乏研究，还不明确农村经济发展方向，因而在互助合作运动中也发生了不少问题。许多读者来信建议各地在今年冬季整顿互助合作组织时，注意下列问题：
    第一，加强对农村干部和广大农民的互助合作政策教育和农村经济发展前途的教育。今年有些地区的领导机关没有很好地进行这种教育，以致发生了互助合作运动中强迫命令和形式主义偏向。读者程振涛、薛友美来信说：苏北涟水县高沟区万圩乡乡指导员黄庆同不重视领导生产互助，领导方面没有向他进行思想教育，就简单地把他撤了职。这样，乡、村干部虽然“重视”生产互助了，但又产生了强迫命令作风。有的干部在群众面前说：“你们看看，乡指导员因为对互助生产工作不积极都被撤职了，你们不互助行不行呢？”万圩乡的干部、党员不认识互助合作是农村经济发展的方向，十五个乡支部委员，只有七个参加了互助组，全乡党员六十八人，参加互助组的只有四十九人，但大部分都是应付门面，他们认为这是上级要这样作，不能不参加。读者汪德文、曲克銮来信说：山东昆嵛县西?村干部不向群众讲清互助政策，就强迫群众组织起来。副乡长王常法对群众说：“谁不参加互助组就是尖头分子，是想走地主、富农道路。”他们又命令民兵站岗放哨，谁不参加互助组，就不许出村。
    第二，检查互助组内是否存在剥削现象，是否贯彻执行了等价互利政策。读者晨光来信说：安徽宿县阎店乡的干部对互助政策宣传解释不够，许多反革命分子、地主和富农都混进了互助组。阎店乡共有三十多个没有改变成分的地主、富农，其中二十多人参加了互助组，在组内继续对农民进行剥削。该乡乡指导员朱明礼亲自掌握的互助组内，有个富农叫王思功，本人不参加劳动，由两个女儿参加做些轻活，结账时还赚了二十多斤工资米。读者霜泉来信说：河北省南和县二区史庄互助组长周麻宏，经常不参加劳动，三天赶集，两天上会（指庙会），天旱了抢先浇自己的地，下雨了又抢先锄自己的地，结果互助组垮了台。有些读者反映，许多互助组成立起来以后，不记工，不算账；有的工资订得低，即使记工算账也不公平。
    上面读者反映的问题，有的已经过检查解决，有的还没有解决。读者一致建议，各地在整顿互助合作组织时，要特别注意这些问题。
