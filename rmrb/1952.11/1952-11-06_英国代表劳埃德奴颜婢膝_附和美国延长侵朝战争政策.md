Xinhua News Agency, November 3rd: British Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, Lloyd, delivered a speech to the Political Committee of the Seventh UN General Assembly on October 30th, servilely echoing the US policy of prolonging the war of aggression against Korea.

According to a report by the United Press, Lloyd, in his speech, while expressing the hope to "immediately achieve the armistice that we desire," supported the US government's stance of obstructing the realization of the armistice. He claimed that repatriating all prisoners of war according to the Geneva Convention on Prisoners of War, signed by the British government, "is contrary to all humanitarian principles." Lloyd stated that he had "not yet discovered" anything "new" in General Nam Il's statement of October 8th and the letters from Generals Kim Il-sung and Peng Dehuai to General Clark on October 16th, while at the same time saying, "I hope my view is wrong."

Lloyd's self-contradictory statement is consistent with the British government's position as a lackey. For more than two years, the British government has been engaged in a bloody trade in human beings – sending British youth to Korea in exchange for US dollars. In the eyes of people like Lloyd, US dollars are, of course, worth much more than the lives of British youth and the tears of orphans and widows. However, the British people hate this dirty business of the British government and resolutely demand withdrawal from the war of aggression against Korea. In order to appease the anger of the British people, the British government has had to pretend to hope for the realization of the Korean armistice. But since the British government has already become a slave to the US dollar, it cannot but continue to prostrate itself at the feet of the Wall Street bosses. This puts the British government in an inextricable contradiction and confusion.

Lloyd said that he did not find anything "new" in the proposals from the Korean and Chinese side, but he did not really need to pretend, as his colleagues already had another view. A United Press dispatch from London on October 27th revealed that "diplomatic sources say that British officials believe that the United States may have missed the opportunity to reach a Korean armistice and suggest that the United States reconsider the proposals made by the Communists this month." Because they believed that the proposals made by General Nam Il and Generals Kim and Peng in their statements and letters "can be said to be 'feasible proposals,' and Britain hopes that the United States will reconsider."

Although Lloyd so actively supported the war policy of his American master, his government, under the opposition of the people, was unable to fully supply the American government with what it needed most in expanding the war of aggression against Korea – "manpower and lives." After US Assistant Secretary of State Hickerson openly extorted cannon fodder from other countries, the British bourgeois newspaper "News Chronicle" stated that Britain had already undertaken many aggressive missions in Malaya, the Suez Canal area, and other places, and could not provide more cannon fodder. Therefore, it considered Hickerson’s "only seeing the Korean battlefield" to be "truly regrettable." For this reason, Lloyd carefully avoided this issue in his speech. People can see that behind Lloyd's bombast is also hidden the helpless sorrow of a shop assistant.

### 英国代表劳埃德奴颜婢膝  附和美国延长侵朝战争政策

    英国代表劳埃德奴颜婢膝
    附和美国延长侵朝战争政策
    【新华社三日讯】英国外交部副大臣劳埃德十月三十日在第七届联合国大会政治委员会上发表演说，奴颜婢膝地附和美国延长侵朝战争的政策。
    据合众社报道，劳埃德在演说中一面表示希望“立刻达到我们所渴望的停战”，一面却又支持美国政府的阻挠停战实现的主张，认为按照英国政府签了字的日内瓦战俘公约遣返全部战俘，“是违背一切人道原则的”。劳埃德一面说他从南日将军十月八日发表的声明和金日成、彭德怀两将军十月十六日给克拉克的信中，“迄今并未发现”有什么“新东西”，一面却又说：“我希望我这种看法是错误的”。
    劳埃德这种自相矛盾的说法，是和英国政府的奴才地位一致的。两年多以来，英国政府一直在干一种血腥的人口买卖——把英国青年送到朝鲜去换取美元。在劳埃德之流看来，美元当然要比英国青年的性命和孤儿寡妇的眼泪值钱得多。但是英国人民恨透了英国政府这种肮脏的买卖，坚决要求退出侵朝战争。为了平息英国人民的愤怒，英国政府不得不做出希望朝鲜停战实现的姿态。但是英国政府既然已经成为美元的奴隶，它就不能不继续匍匐在华尔街老板的脚下。这就使英国政府陷于不能自拔的矛盾和混乱之中。
    劳埃德说他从朝中方面的建议中没有发见什么
    “新东西”，但是他其实大可不必装腔作势，他的同僚早已有了另一种看法。合众社伦敦十月二十七日电透露说：“外交界人士说，英国官员认为美国可能已经错过了达成朝鲜停战的机会，建议美国再度考虑共产党本月提出的建议。”因为他们认为，南日将军和金、彭两将军在声明和信件中提出的建议，“可以说是‘可行的建议’，英国希望美国再行考虑”。
    劳埃德虽然如此积极地替他的美国主子的战争政策捧场，但是在人民的反对之下，他的政府却无法充分供给美国政府在扩大侵朝战争中最需要的东西——“人力与生命”。在美国助理国务卿希克逊公开向其他国家勒索炮灰以后，英国的资产阶级报纸“新闻纪事报”就表示英国已经在马来亚、苏彝士等地担负了许多侵略任务，拿不出更多的炮灰来了，因此对于希克逊“只看到朝鲜战场”，认为“真是太令人感觉遗憾”。正因为如此，所以劳埃德在他的演说里小心翼翼地避开了这一个问题。人们可以看到，在劳埃德的大言不惭后面，还隐藏着小伙计的无可奈何的悲哀。
