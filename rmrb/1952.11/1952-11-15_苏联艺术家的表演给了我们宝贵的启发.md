The continuous performances of Soviet artists in the capital have given the people of the capital a great education. Whether it is "Classical Dance," "Army Dance," "Saber Dance," puppet shows, violin performances, or solo singing, all have captured the hearts of the audience with such a high degree of ideological and artistic quality, immersing them in a sublime, uplifting, heroic, and joyful spiritual world. This is an art that integrates the long and glorious literary and artistic traditions of the various ethnic groups of the Soviet Union, reflects the happy and striving lives of the various ethnic groups of the Soviet Union in socialist construction, and expresses the advanced thoughts and healthy emotions of the people. It belongs to the broad masses of the people and is also understood by the broad masses of the people. It is fundamentally different from the decadent and degenerate formalistic art of the bourgeoisie.

The performances of Soviet artists have also given our literary and art workers extremely valuable inspiration and education. It makes us more deeply understand the correctness of Chairman Mao's literary and art policy. Ten years ago, Chairman Mao taught us that literature and art must serve the people and must be welcomed and loved by the broad masses of the people; and the development of people's literature and art in New China must develop forward from the excellent national literary and artistic traditions, draw nourishment from the rich literary and artistic treasures of the broad masses of the people, and obtain "lessons" from the excellent art of foreign countries (especially the Soviet Union). Now that we have seen the brilliant achievements of Soviet artists, we have increased our confidence a hundredfold in the arduous task of creating the people's literature and art of New China under the leadership of Chairman Mao's literary and art policy. The Soviet Union's today is our tomorrow; the same is true in literature and art.

Finally, it should also be mentioned in passing: The performances of Soviet artists have also provided valuable inspiration and education for our literary and art workers' narrow and mechanical views on the principle of "serving the people," which they have committed in the past and are continuing to correct. This narrow and mechanical view has hindered the depth of ideological content in our literary and artistic works and has caused one-sidedness in our selection of themes.

    苏联艺术家的表演给了我们宝贵的启发
    茅盾
    苏联艺术家们在首都的连续表演，给了首都人民以很大的教育。无论是“古典舞”、“大军舞”、“马刀舞”，无论是木偶戏，无论是提琴演奏和独唱，都以这样高度的思想性和艺术性紧紧抓住了观众的心灵，陶醉于崇高、昂扬、雄壮、愉快的精神世界。这是融贯着苏联各族人民的悠久光辉的文艺传统，反映着苏联各族人民在社会主义建设中的幸福而奋发的生活，表现了人民的先进思想和健康感情的艺术，是广大人民的东西，也是广大人民所理解的东西。它和资产阶级的腐化堕落的形式主义的艺术，根本不同。
    苏联艺术家们的表演又给了我国的文艺工作者以极宝贵的启发和教育。它使我们更深一层地体会到毛主席文艺方针的正确。十年前，毛主席就教导我们，文艺必须是为人民服务的，必须是广大人民所喜见乐闻的；而新中国的人民文艺的发展必须从民族的优秀文艺传统向前发展，从广大人民的丰厚的文艺宝藏中汲取营养，从外国（特别是苏联）的优秀艺术中取得“借鉴”。现在我们看了苏联艺术家的辉煌的成就，使我们对于自己的在毛主席文艺方针领导下的创造新中国人民文艺这一艰巨的任务，增加了百倍的信心。苏联的今天就是我们的明天；在文艺方面亦复如此。
    最后，也应当带便说起：苏联艺术家的表演，对于我们的文艺工作者在“为人民服务”这原则上所犯过的，而且正在继续纠正着的狭隘的机械的看法，也提示了宝贵的启示和教育。这种狭隘的机械的看法曾经阻碍了我们的文艺作品在思想内容上的深入，并使我们在题材的取择上发生了片面性。
