    Soviet Films in China
    Wang Lanxi, Deputy Director of the Film Bureau of the Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government

    For more than twenty years, Soviet films have had a positive influence on the Chinese people. However, for a long time under the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, they could not reach the broad masses of the Chinese people, nor could they educate a wider audience. They only had a considerable impact among a small number of progressive film workers or progressive masses. It was not until the national liberation and the founding of the People's Republic of China that this influence expanded among the broad masses of the people nationwide. For more than three years, Soviet films have become a cultural nourishment as warmly welcomed by the broad audience as Chinese people's films.

    Soviet films, with their progressive revolutionary ideological content—the great spirit of patriotism and internationalism, the spirit of socialism and communism—are infused with deep emotions using extremely high artistic techniques. Through these films, the lofty ideas of the great Lenin and Stalin are elucidated; the great heroic Patriotic War of the Soviet Union and the heroic figures in the war are summarized and faithfully recorded; the construction in all aspects of the Soviet Union and the advanced figures in the construction cause are reported; the magnificent, huge, and rich country of the Soviet Union and the happy lives of its people are introduced; and the ugly features and criminal nature of the war instigators headed by U.S. imperialism are truthfully exposed. Soviet films with such content are a very important educational weapon for the Chinese people who have just been liberated from reactionary rule.

    The influence of Soviet films in China over the past three years can be illustrated by the fact that the audience has been increasing day by day. According to incomplete statistics, the total number of viewers in the past three years to the first half of this year is about 186,026,643. The number of viewers has been increasing every year. According to incomplete data, there were 6,629,977 viewers in 1949, 48,287,169 viewers in 1950, 64,957,825 viewers in 1951, and 66,151,672 viewers in the first half of 1952 alone. More than 200 Soviet films have been released in China, of which more than 140 have been translated into Chinese. Among these films, the particularly popular ones that have become familiar to the broad masses of the people include "The Fall of Berlin," with about 14 million viewers, "The Battle of Stalingrad," with more than 8 million viewers, "Brave People," with more than 7.3 million viewers, and "The Young Guard," with more than 5 million viewers. These films have left a deep and strong political impact on the broad audience. Soviet films have enhanced the great friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people. Through the films, the audience has become more fond of Lenin and Stalin, recognized the superiority of the Soviet social system, understood the construction of the Soviet Union in all aspects, become familiar with the figures of the Soviet Union in all aspects, and developed a deep friendship with these figures, thus making our people increasingly yearn for the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union has become our ideal and our best example. To specifically illustrate this education and influence, it can be said that it is very deep in factories, troops, rural areas, among intellectuals, young people and children, and among ordinary citizens. Films such as "The Fall of Berlin" and "The Battle of Stalingrad" have made the broad audience more clearly aware of the strength of the Soviet Union and that the Soviet Union is the most reliable fortress of world peace. Films such as "The Conspiracy," "Meeting on the Elbe," and "They Have a Motherland" have given people a deeper understanding of the essence of the reactionary factions of British and American imperialism, thereby correcting the ideas of worshipping and being close to the United States and effectively cooperating with China's ideological reform movement. Films such as "An Ordinary Soldier," "Steel Will," "Third Blow," and "The Great Turning Point" have created a learning movement in the troops and produced figures like "Matrosov." "Zoya," "The Young Guard," and "A Teacher" have established models for learning among young people and teachers. Chinese scientists and artists, from "The Court of Honor" and "Siberian Symphony," have further recognized that science and art must be combined with the masses and that science and art must serve the people. "Tractor Drivers" and agricultural education films are also popular among farmers. Young children warmly welcome "Happy Childhood," "Little Hero," "Young Pioneer," and other animated films and fairy tales because they give them a good education. All these influences have become or will become the guidance for the actions of the broad audience.

    Therefore, Soviet films in our ideological field and cultural life, like the assistance of Soviet experts in the restoration and development of various constructions in our new China, constantly give us strength and encourage us to move towards a great future!

    In our struggle against the reactionary, degenerate, and low-level vulgar British and American films, Soviet films have also assisted our country's films. The Chinese film market was long filled with reactionary films of British and American imperialism, which spread poison among the broad audience in China, and many people were anesthetized. With the development of the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea and the improvement of the people's political level, we gradually eliminated British and American films and replaced them with progressive films, among which Soviet films have been of great help to us.

    Soviet film workers have also given selfless assistance to the development of the Chinese people's film industry. In the history of the development of the Chinese people's film industry, the Sino-Soviet co-produced color films "Victory of the Chinese People" and "Liberated China" occupy a brilliant position. The rich experience and brilliant achievements of Soviet film industry for more than 30 years are "good teachers and helpful friends" for us. For more than three years, our Chinese people's film workers have received great help, which plays a significant role in the correct development of the Chinese people's film industry.

    As our country warmly celebrates the 35th anniversary of the October Socialist Revolution in the Soviet Union, the delegation of Soviet film workers comes to China, and our country will hold a new Soviet film exhibition during the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month," we congratulate the brilliant achievements of Soviet films in China, thank the Soviet film workers for their help to us! Thank the leader and mentor of the working people of the world, the great Comrade Stalin!

    苏联电影在中国
    中央人民政府文化部电影局副局长  王阑西
    苏联电影二十多年来都给中国人民以良好的影响，但过去长期在国民党反动派的统治下，它不能与中国广大人民见面，不能使更广大的观众接受其教育，只在少数的进步电影工作者中或进步群众中有相当影响。直到全国解放，中华人民共和国成立之后，这个影响才在全国广大人民中扩大了。三年多以来，苏联电影已成为与中国人民电影同样的为广大观众所热烈欢迎的文化食粮了。
    苏联影片，以进步的革命思想内容——伟大的爱国主义与国际主义精神，社会主义与共产主义精神，用极高度的艺术手法，注入着深厚的情感。通过这些影片，阐明了伟大的列宁、斯大林的崇高思想；概括并忠实地纪录了苏联伟大的英勇的卫国战争和战争中的英雄形象；报道了苏联在各方面的建设和建设事业中的先进人物；介绍了苏联这个雄伟巨大富庶的国家和他们人民的幸福生活；并且真实地揭发了以美帝国主义为首的战争挑拨者的丑态和罪恶本质。这样内容的苏联影片，对于刚刚从反动统治下解放出来的中国人民，是非常重要的教育武器。
    三年多以来，苏联影片在中国的影响，从观众日渐增加的事实中可以说明。三年多的观众总数，据不完全的统计，至今年上半年止，共计约有一八六、○二六、六四三人。每年的观众人数都是不断增加的，据不完全的材料，一九四九年观众六、六二九、九七七人，一九五○年观众四八、二八七、一六九人，一九五一年观众六四、九五七、八二五人，一九五二年只上半年统计已达六六、一五一、六七二人。苏联影片在中国上映的已有二百余部，其中译成华语的有一百四十余部。在这些影片中特别受欢迎的，已成为广大人民所熟悉的影片，如“攻克柏林”的观众约一千四百余万人，“斯大林格勒大血战”的观众八百余万人，“勇敢的人”的观众七百三十余万人，“青年近卫军”的观众五百余万人。这些影片在广大观众之中，留下了深刻的强烈的政治影响。苏联影片增强了中苏两国人民的伟大友谊，通过影片，使观众更加热爱列宁、斯大林，认识了苏联社会制度的优越性，了解了苏联的各个方面的建设，熟悉了苏联各个方面的人物，并同这些人物发生了深厚的友谊，因而使我国人民日益热烈地向往苏联。苏联成了我们的理想，我们最好的榜样。如果要具体地说明这种教育和影响，完全可以说，无论在工厂，在部队，在农村，在知识分子和青年儿童中，及一般市民中都是很深厚的。“攻克柏林”、“斯大林格勒大血战”等影片，使广大观众更清楚地认识了苏联力量的强大，苏联是世界和平最可靠的堡垒；“阴谋”、“易比河会师”、“他们有祖国”等影片，使人们对英美帝国主义反动派的本质有了更深刻的认识，从而纠正了崇美亲美的思想，有力地配合了我国的思想改造运动。“普通一兵”、“钢铁意志”、“第三次打击”、“伟大的转折”等影片，在部队的指战员中造成了学习运动，产生了“马特洛索夫”式的人物。“丹娘”、“青年近卫军”、“桃李满天下”在青年中和教师中树立了学习的模范。中国的科学工作者、艺术工作者们，从“荣誉审判会”、“西伯利亚交响乐”中，更认识科学、艺术必须与群众相结合，科学、艺术必须为人民服务。“拖拉机手”和农业教育片也受到农民的欢迎；少年儿童们非常欢迎“幸福童年”、“小英雄”、“红领巾”及其他的动画片、童话片，因为它们给他们以良好的教育。这一切影响都已成为或即将成为广大观众行动的指导。
    所以，在我们思想领域和文化生活中的苏联影片，如同苏联专家对我新中国的各项建设的恢复与发展的帮助一样，不断给我们以力量，鼓舞我们向着伟大的将来前进！
    在我们和反动的、堕落的、低级下流的英美影片的斗争中，苏联影片也援助了我国影片。中国的电影市场长时期被英美帝国主义的反动影片所充斥，它在中国广大观众中散布毒素，不少的人受麻醉。随着抗美援朝运动展开和人民政治水平的提高，我们逐渐肃清了英美影片，而代之以进步的影片，这其中苏联影片是对我们有过巨大的帮助的。
    苏联电影工作者对中国人民电影事业的发展，也给了大公无私的援助。在我国人民电影事业发展的历史上，中苏合制的“中国人民的胜利”和“解放了的中国”等五彩影片，占有了光辉的地位。苏联电影事业三十多年的丰富经验和电影艺术的辉煌成就，对于我们是“良师益友”。三年多以来，我们中国的人民电影工作者已经得到了很大的帮助，这对中国人民电影事业的正确发展起着极大作用。
    当我们全国热烈庆祝苏联十月社会主义革命三十五周年，苏联电影工作者代表莅临中国，及我国将在“中苏友好月”举行苏联新的影片展览之际，我们祝贺苏联电影在中国的辉煌成就，感谢苏联电影工作者对我们的帮助！感谢世界劳动人民的领袖和导师伟大的斯大林同志！
