Xinhua News Agency, 9th. After the U.S. government's so-called "voluntary repatriation" was denounced by peace-loving people around the world as baseless and losing its deceptive effect, it has changed the so-called "voluntary repatriation" to what they now call "non-forcible repatriation" and is determined to use this unreasonable demand, which is in fact the forcible detention of prisoners of war, to obstruct the realization of a Korean armistice. According to the U.S. Information Service, the U.S. spokesman in the United Nations on the 7th reiterated that one of the "absolutely firm" factors in the U.S. attitude toward the Korean issue is the so-called "non-forcible repatriation of prisoners of war."

Now let us see what exactly the U.S. government's principle of so-called "non-forcible repatriation of prisoners of war," which it is forcing other countries to agree to at the United Nations General Assembly, is.

Anyone with a little common sense can see that the U.S. government's so-called "non-forcible repatriation of prisoners of war" is the same as its so-called "voluntary repatriation," and is absolutely untenable both legally and factually.

Everyone knows that prisoners of war are people under the military control of the detaining party. The most humane way to treat them, and the way that best meets their needs, is to lift this military control after the armistice and repatriate them to their homes to live peaceful lives. Therefore, the Geneva Convention cannot stipulate so-called "non-forcible repatriation" so that the detaining country can use the pretext of "non-forcible repatriation" to detain prisoners of war. In order to prevent the occurrence of so-called "non-forcible repatriation," the Geneva Convention also states in its Article 7 that prisoners of war may not, under any circumstances, renounce any part or all of the rights granted to them by the Convention. It can be seen that the Geneva Convention is absolutely opposed to so-called "non-forcible repatriation" or "voluntary repatriation" in the principle of repatriation. Therefore, the U.S. government's so-called "non-forcible repatriation" has no legal basis whatsoever. It is simply a euphemism for the U.S. government's detention of prisoners of war.

The U.S. government's absurd claim of so-called "non-forcible repatriation of prisoners of war" not only has nothing in common with the Geneva Convention, which guarantees the rights of prisoners of war, but also completely violates the provisions of Article 51 of the draft Korean Armistice Agreement, which it itself agreed to. This clause stipulates that "all prisoners of war held by both sides at the time of the entry into effect of this Armistice Agreement shall be released and repatriated as soon as possible." To put it bluntly, the U.S. government's so-called "non-forcible repatriation of prisoners of war," which has no legal basis, is an attempt to use this as a cover to create so-called "prisoners of war who refuse repatriation," and is simply forcibly detaining prisoners of war.

In fact, contrary to the U.S. government's lies, prisoners of war are not "refusing repatriation," but resolutely demanding repatriation. In order to defend their right to be repatriated, prisoners of war in U.S. prisoner-of-war camps, regardless of the suppression and massacre by U.S. troops and U.S. special agents, have carried out heroic struggles, advancing wave upon wave. On February 18, all the prisoners of war in U.S. Prisoner of War Camp No. 62 on Geoje Island opposed the U.S.'s so-called screening and were therefore subjected to a bloody massacre by the U.S. side. Even the so-called International Committee of the Red Cross could not hide the truth of this incident. On April 10, just as the U.S. side was transporting forcibly detained prisoners of war to the South Korean mainland, more than 60 prisoners of war who refused to be detained were beaten to death or injured. This news was suppressed by the U.S. side for more than 40 days before it was revealed. The endless massacres of prisoners of war in the U.S. camps detaining so-called "prisoners of war who refuse repatriation" are particularly sufficient to illustrate the strong will of the prisoners of war to demand repatriation. The U.S. side once claimed that all the prisoners of war they detained on the South Korean mainland were "anti-communist" prisoners of war, but even in these prisoner-of-war camps, prisoners of war were still massacred for resolutely demanding repatriation. According to only the more serious massacre incidents that the U.S. side has revealed, there are: on May 20, 86 prisoners of war were beaten to death or injured in the Busan prisoner-of-war camp; on June 10, 170 prisoners of war were beaten to death or injured in the Geoje Island prisoner-of-war camp; on October 1, Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war on Jeju Island, who were claimed by the U.S. side to be "anti-communist cooperation," demonstrated their will to be repatriated to their motherland by celebrating the National Day of the Motherland, and were therefore barbarously beaten to death or injured by the U.S. side, totaling 165 people; on October 28, 29, and 30, 180 people were continuously beaten to death or injured. All this fully proves how hypocritical and shameless the U.S. government's claim that prisoners of war "refuse repatriation" is.

The matter is already very clear that the U.S. government's so-called "non-forcible repatriation of prisoners of war" is a euphemism for the forcible detention of prisoners of war. The U.S. government has openly declared that they want to implement the vicious policy of "using Asians to fight Asians." The U.S. government is attempting to use the excuse of "non-forcible repatriation of prisoners of war" to detain Korean and Chinese prisoners of war and send them to Chiang Kai-shek and the Lee Seung-man bandit gangs, the mortal enemies of the Korean and Chinese people, so as to use them to fight their brothers and be substitutes for the U.S. military.

This vicious conspiracy of the U.S. government is not only aimed at the Korean and Chinese people, but also at the people of the world. The U.S. war-mongers have already implemented the policy of requiring European capitalist countries to expand their armaments and prepare for war, so as to use Europeans to fight Europeans. If the U.S. government is allowed to violate all international conventions and practices and forcibly detain prisoners of war under the pretext of "non-forcible repatriation of prisoners of war" in order to realize its "Asians fighting Asians" policy, then the U.S. government will not only drive Asians to fight Asians, but will also drive Europeans to fight Europeans. All peace-loving countries and peace-loving people must see through this vicious conspiracy of the U.S. government and be doubly vigilant.

### 美国的所谓“自愿遣返”失去欺骗作用后  又藉口“不强迫遣返”继续阻挠停战谈判

    美国的所谓“自愿遣返”失去欺骗作用后
    又藉口“不强迫遣返”继续阻挠停战谈判
    【新华社九日讯】美国政府在其毫无理由、毫无根据的所谓“自愿遣返”被全世界爱好和平的人民所唾骂而失掉了欺骗作用之后，已经把所谓“自愿遣返”改为什么“不强迫遣返”，并决心用这个实际上是强迫扣留战俘的无理要求来阻挠朝鲜停战的实现。据美国新闻处报道，在联合国中的美国发言人在七日重申美国对朝鲜问题的态度中的一个“绝对坚定的”因素，那就是所谓“不强迫遣返战俘”。
    现在我们来看看美国政府在联合国大会上硬要其他国家同意的所谓“不强迫遣返战俘”的原则究竟是个什么东西。
    任何稍明事理的人都可以看出来，美国政府的所谓“不强迫遣返战俘”的主张，和它的所谓“自愿遣返”主张是一个东西，无论从法理上和事实上来看，都是绝对站不住脚的。
    人人知道，战俘是在拘留方面武力控制之下的人。对于他们的最人道的办法，也是最合乎他们的要求的办法，就是在停战以后解除这种武力控制，遣返他们回家过和平生活。正因此，所以日内瓦公约不能规定所谓“不强迫遣返”，使拘留国得以利用“不强迫遣返”的借口来扣留战俘。日内瓦公约并且为了防止利用所谓“不强迫遣返”的情况发生，而在其第七条中申明：在任何情况下战俘不得放弃本公约所赋予战俘的权利的一部或全部。由此可见，日内瓦公约是绝对反对在遣俘原则中有所谓
    “不强迫遣返”或“自愿遣返”的。因此，美国政府的所谓“不强迫遣返”是毫无法理根据的。它完全是美国政府扣留战俘的代名词。
    美国政府这种所谓“不强迫遣返战俘”的荒谬主张，不但与保障战俘权利的日内瓦公约毫无共同之处，而且也完全违反了它自己同意的朝鲜停战协定草案第五十一款的规定。这一款规定：“本停战协定生效时各方所收容的全部战俘须尽速予以释放与遣返。”拆穿来说，美国政府这种毫无法理根据的所谓“不强迫遣返战俘”的主张，就是企图以此作为幌子，制造所谓“拒绝遣返”的战俘，就是强迫扣留战俘。
    事实上，和美国政府的谎言完全相反，战俘不是“拒绝遣返”，而是坚决要求遣返。为了保卫他们被遣返的权利，在美方战俘营中的战俘不顾美国军队和美国特务的镇压和屠杀，进行了前仆后继的英勇斗争。二月十八日，巨济岛上美方六十二号战俘营中的全体战俘，反对美方的所谓甄别因此遭到了美方的血腥屠杀，就是所谓红十字国际委员会也无法隐瞒这一事件的真相。四月十日，正当美方将被强迫扣留的战俘运到南朝鲜大陆上去时，拒绝被扣留的战俘被打死打伤了六十多人。这个消息被美方扣压了四十多天以后才透露出来。在美方拘留所谓“拒绝遣返”的战俘的战俘营中发生的层出不穷的屠杀战俘事件，特别足以说明战俘要求遣返的坚强意志。美方曾经宣称他们在南朝鲜大陆上拘留的都是“反共”的战俘，但是就在这些战俘营中，战俘仍然因为坚决要求遣返而遭到屠杀。仅仅根据美方已经透露出来的较重大的屠杀事件就有：五月二十日釜山战俘营打死打伤战俘八十六人；六月十日巨济岛战俘营打死打伤一百七十余人；十月一日济州岛上被美方硬说是“反共合作”的中国人民志愿军战俘，用庆祝祖国国庆的行动表明了他们要求遣返祖国的意志，因此被美方野蛮地打死打伤了一百六十五人；十月二十八日、二十九及三十等日连续打死打伤一百八十人。这一切都充分证明了美国政府的所谓战俘“拒绝遣返”的说法，是多么虚伪与无耻。
    事情已经十分明显，美国政府的所谓“不强迫遣返战俘”，就是强迫扣留战俘的代名词。美国政府已经公开宣称，他们要实行“用亚洲人打亚洲人”的恶毒政策。美国政府企图用“不强迫遣返战俘”的借口，扣留朝中战俘将他们送给朝中人民的死敌蒋介石和李承晚匪帮，以便利用他们来和他们的兄弟打仗，做美国军队的替死鬼。
    美国政府的这个恶毒阴谋不仅仅是针对朝中人民的，而且也是针对着全世界人民的。美国的战争贩子已经实行要欧洲资本主义各国扩军备战，以便利用欧洲人打欧洲人。如果容许美国政府破坏一切国际公约和惯例，用“不强迫遣返战俘”的借口来强迫扣留战俘，以实现其“亚洲人打亚洲人”的政策，那末，美国政府不仅将驱策亚洲人去打亚洲人，而且将要驱策欧洲人去打欧洲人。一切爱好和平的国家和爱好和平的人民必须看清美国政府的这个恶毒阴谋而加倍警惕。
