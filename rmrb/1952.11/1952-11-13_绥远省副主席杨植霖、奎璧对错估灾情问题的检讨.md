    Suiyuan Province Vice Chairmen Yang Zhilin and Kui Bi Self-Criticize for Misjudging the Disaster Situation

    Editor: We believe that Comrade Liu Yaming's opinion in the "Reader's Letters" column on August 9th regarding the serious errors in our province's decision on production and disaster relief work based on false reports last year is correct. Although we conducted a review of this issue during the Three-Anti Campaign, it was not deep or thorough enough. After Comrade Liu Yaming's opinion was published, we conducted a more in-depth review for more than a month, and compared the past reports from various places with investigation materials and grain allocation, and only then did we further realize the seriousness of the errors we committed. We have convened a review meeting with responsible cadres from relevant departments. The preliminary inspection results are submitted below.

    In the summer and autumn of 1951, various parts of our province suffered from varying degrees of drought, pests, wind, hail, frost, and other disasters. According to reports and estimates from various places, the average reduction in production across the province was 60%. In October, we organized disaster area慰问查灾团 comfort and disaster investigation groups to go to various disaster areas to understand the disaster situation and stabilize the people's emotions. We found that many areas had intentionally or unintentionally exaggerated the disaster situation. At the end of October, the Provincial People's Government convened a production and disaster relief meeting, criticized the exaggeration of the disaster situation and various erroneous ideas, and verified the reduction in production across the province to be 55%. By the end of December, after a period of work, and after conducting typical investigations in the disaster areas, we found that some areas still had overestimations of the disaster situation. According to the disaster assessment materials for the collection of public grain, the estimated average harvest across the province was above 55%, and the actual reduction in production was 45%. In other words, our province had overestimated the disaster situation by 10% to 15% in the past.

    Due to the error in estimating the disaster situation, errors also occurred in the grain allocation. At the end of October last year, based on the estimate of a 55% reduction in production across the province, it was initially determined that the province was short of 300 million catties of grain; in addition to mobilizing the masses to produce and help themselves, it was still necessary to transfer 180 million catties of grain from outside the province. After December, we discovered that the estimated disaster situation was still too high, and then reduced the grain transfer figure to 120 million catties. Finally, according to the public grain disaster assessment materials (harvest above 55%), it was calculated that the province's grain was basically sufficient. Under normal circumstances, the province's grain only needs to be appropriately adjusted by itself, and there is no need to transfer it from outside. However, after the disaster occurred, it was the time of year when the old grain had run out and the new grain had not yet been harvested, and the masses had panic emotions, and unscrupulous merchants took the opportunity to disrupt the market. At that time, in addition to vigorously mobilizing the masses to produce and help themselves, we took emergency measures and transferred some grain from outside the province, which played a great role in solving the grain problem and stabilizing the people's emotions. It is also needed in today's view. However, the error lies in transferring too much grain, exceeding the need. In particular, we failed to make serious revisions to the plan for estimating the potential grain in our province and deciding to transfer grain from outside the province based on the disaster situation, which resulted in the transfer of grain back out, causing serious waste and causing huge losses to the country.

    The main reason for the error is that our leadership has serious bureaucracy, lacks the spirit of in-depth investigation and research, and a serious and responsible attitude. After the disaster occurred, we were misled by the temporary panic of the masses and the calls of the cadres. Therefore, based on untrue reports, we subjectively and erroneously estimated the disaster situation to be 55%, which in turn led to the error of estimating the grain shortage and blindly transferring grain. After reducing the amount of grain transferred from outside the province in December last year, we found that the grain transferred to the disaster areas was not selling quickly; this year's land reform in February resulted in our knowledge that the province's farmers had been allocated more than 70 million catties of surplus grain from landlords, and that farmers had solved 30 million catties of grain through production and self-help; the grain requisition work has proven that the harvest was not 45% but 55%, but we did not pay attention to studying these new situations and revising the plan until we stopped transferring grain to the outside in April this year. This proves that our work style of not being serious and responsible is very serious. Secondly, we also have erroneous ideas of localism and departmentalism. We one-sidedly believed that the disaster situation in our region was serious. In order to make the disaster relief grain sufficient and not starve a single person to death, we developed the idea of estimating the disaster situation as high as possible and wanting as much relief grain as possible when the situation was not clear. This shows that we are still unable to correctly handle the relationship between partial interests and overall interests, and our national overall concept is not strong enough.

    In short, our errors are serious. In addition to our deep review, correcting errors, continuing to carry out anti-bureaucracy and strengthening the overall concept, in order to maintain national laws and disciplines and to make us more deeply accept this lesson, we sincerely request the higher authorities to give us punishment, and we are willing to accept strict criticism from all parties.

### 绥远省副主席杨植霖、奎璧对错估灾情问题的检讨

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    绥远省副主席杨植霖、奎璧对错估灾情问题的检讨
    编辑同志：八月九日“读者来信专页”中，柳崖明同志对我省去年根据假报告决定生产救灾工作而产生的严重错误的意见，我们认为是正确的。我们在三反运动中对此问题虽进行了检查，但仍不够深刻与彻底。柳崖明同志的意见发表后，我们又经过一个多月的深入检查，并将过去各地报告与调查材料以及粮食调运情况进行查对，才进一步感到我们所犯错误的严重性。我们已召集有关部门负责干部进行了检讨。现将初步检查结果送上。
    一九五一年夏、秋，我省各地普遍遭受不同程度的旱、虫、风、雹、冻等灾害。根据各地报告估算，全省平均受灾减产六成。十月间我们组织灾区慰问查灾团，分赴各灾区了解灾情并稳定群众情绪，发现不少地区有意无意地扩大了灾情。省人民政府在十月底召开生产救灾会议，批判了多报灾情及各种错误思想，将全省受灾减产数核定为五成五。至十二月底，我们经过了一段时间的工作，并深入灾区作了典型调查，发现有些地区灾情仍有估计过高的现象。根据征收公粮的评灾材料，全省估计平均收成在五成五以上，实际减产为四成五。也就是说，我省过去多估了一成至一成五的灾情。
    由于灾情估算错误，在调粮问题上也就发生了错误。在去年十月底根据全省减产五成五的估计，初步确定全省缺粮三亿斤；除发动群众生产自救外，尚需从省外调入粮食一亿八千万斤。十二月后发现灾情估计仍过高，当把调粮数字减为一亿二千万斤。最后根据征公粮评灾材料（收成五成五以上）计算，证明全省粮食基本够用。本省粮食在一般情况下，只要自行适当调剂，不需要从外调入。但灾情发生后，正值青黄不接之时，群众有恐慌情绪，奸商趁机捣乱市场。当时我们除大力发动群众生产自救外，采取紧急措施，从省外调进一部粮食，对解决粮食问题、稳定群众情绪是起了很大作用的。在今天看来也是需要的。但错误在于调入粮食太多，超过了需要。尤其我们对本省潜在粮食的估算和根据灾情决定向省外调粮问题的计划未能随时作认真的修正，以致调入的粮食又往外调运，造成严重的浪费，使国家遭受了巨大损失。
    产生错误的主要原因是我们领导上有着严重的官僚主义，缺乏深入调查研究的精神与严肃认真的态度。灾情发生后，我们被群众一时的恐慌情绪以及干部的叫声所迷惑。因此，在不真实的报告基础上主观地错误地估计灾情为五成五，从而又产生了缺粮估算和盲目调粮的错误。在去年十二月缩小省外调粮数字后，我们发现调入灾区的粮食销售不快；今年二月土地改革，结果，我们才知全省农民分得地主多余粮食七千余万斤和农民生产自救解决粮食三千多万斤；在征粮工作中已证明收成不是四成五而是五成五，但我们对这些新情况并未注意研究，重新修正计划，直到今年四月才停止向外调粮。这证明我们工作中不严肃、不认真的作风是十分严重的。其次，我们还有着地方主义、本位主义的错误思想。我们片面地认为本地区灾情严重，为使救灾粮食充足，不饿死一个人，在情况掌握不清的情况下，便产生了对灾情估计宁高勿低，要救济粮时宁多勿少的思想。这说明了我们还不能够正确地处理局部利益和整体利益的关系，国家整体观念是不够强的。
    总之，我们的错误是严重的。除了我们深刻检讨、纠正错误，继续进行反官僚主义和加强整体观念外，为了维护国家法纪和使我们更深刻地接受这一教训，我们诚恳地要求上级给予我们处分，并愿接受各方面的严格批评。  杨植霖  奎璧
