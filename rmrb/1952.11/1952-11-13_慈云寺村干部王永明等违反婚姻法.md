    Ciyunsi Village Cadres Wang Yongming and Others Violate the Marriage Law
    Editor: From what I understand, one of the reasons why the marriage law cannot be implemented in some rural areas is that some village cadres and Communist Party members still have feudal ideas. This is the case in Ciyunsi Village in the eastern suburbs of Beijing. Wang Yongming, the deputy village chief of the village, betrothed his nine-year-old daughter Wang Wenying to Liu Qifeng, the son of Liu Jinyuan, in his early years because he had borrowed ten yuan from Liu Jinyuan. Last winter, when they were about to be forced into marriage, Wang Wenying (nineteen years old) obtained a marriage certificate under Wang Yongming's coercion. However, she was very unwilling and cried to Yu Baoqin, the secretary of the village Communist Youth League branch, but Yu did nothing. Two months after the marriage, Wang Wenying went to Yu Baoqin again to ask for help with a divorce, but Yu still did not actively support her. When Wang Wenying went to Ren Zhongmin, the director of the village women's association, for help, Ren not only did not help but instead said Wang Wenying was "shameless." Later, Wang Wenying appealed to the village people's government, but because her father was the deputy village chief, she was suppressed by her father, and it was not reported to the higher-level people's government. Her mother also told her: "You are a Liu family member alive and a Liu family ghost when you die." Wang Wenying's problem has not yet been resolved, and she is so angry that she is seriously ill. Another example is Li Bin, a Communist Party member in the village, who has serious male chauvinist ideas. In September of this year, Li Bin was detained for an hour for violating traffic regulations while transporting goods to Beijing. When Li Bin returned home in a rage, he happened to see that his wife had sold four eggs. Because it was done without his permission, he beat his wife indiscriminately, blinding one of her eyes. Another example is Li Lüshi, a people's representative in the village, who often mistreats her daughter-in-law. Since Li Baishi, her daughter-in-law, was arranged by her parents to come to her family, she has not had a good day. She is either not given food or is beaten and scolded. Even when she is pregnant, she has to do heavy work as usual. After liberation, Li Lüshi has been elected as a people's representative, but her mistreatment of her daughter-in-law has not changed. The whole family eats dumplings, but Li Baishi is made to eat cornbread. Even if there are leftover dumplings, they would rather dry them than give them to Li Baishi. Li Lüshi also provokes feelings between her daughter-in-law and her son, instigating her son to beat her daughter-in-law. Li Lüshi has also personally beaten her daughter-in-law twice.
    The above-mentioned village cadres, Communist Party members, and people's representatives should have been role models for the masses, but instead, they took the lead in violating the marriage law. I suggest that the relevant leaders investigate and correct this and strengthen the education of village cadres.

### 慈云寺村干部王永明等违反婚姻法

    慈云寺村干部王永明等违反婚姻法
    编辑同志：据我了解，某些农村之所以不能贯彻执行婚姻法的原因之一，是某些村干部和共产党员还有封建思想。北京市东郊区慈云寺村的情况便是这样。该村副村长王永明，早年因借过刘金元的十块钱，便把年仅九岁的女儿王文英订给刘金元的儿子刘启凤为妻。去年冬天他俩要被包办结婚时，王文英（十九岁）在王永明的威逼下领了结婚登记证。但她很不愿意，就到村中青年团支部书记于宝琴面前痛哭，于不管。结婚后两个月，王文英又去找于宝琴请求帮助离婚，于仍然没有积极支持她。王文英到村妇女会主任任忠敏处请求帮助时，任不但不帮助，反而说王文英“不要脸”。后来王文英向村人民政府提出，因为她父亲是副村长，被她父亲压下去了，没向上级人民政府反映。她母亲也对她表示：“你活着是刘家人，死了是刘家鬼。”现在王文英的问题还没有解决，并且气得生了重病。又如该村李斌，是共产党员，但有严重的大男子主义思想。今年九月，李斌到北京城里运输东西，因违犯交通规则，被扣留了一小时。李斌气冲冲地回家时，正赶上他妻子卖了四个鸡蛋，因为没有通过他，他便黑白不分地打他妻子，竟把他妻子的一只眼睛打瞎了。又如该村人民代表李吕氏，经常虐待儿媳。她儿媳李白氏，自从由父母包办到她家后，没好过一天，不是不给吃，就是挨打受骂，怀了孕也要照常作重活。解放后，李吕氏已经当选为人民代表，但对儿媳的虐待不变。全家吃饺子，却让李白氏吃玉米面饼子，即使剩下饺子，也宁可晒起来而不给李白氏吃。李吕氏还挑拨儿媳和儿子间的情感，唆使儿子打儿媳。李吕氏也曾经亲手打过儿媳两次。
    上述村干部、共产党员、人民代表，本应该做群众的楷模，结果却带头违反婚姻法。我建议有关领导方面检查纠正，并加强对村干部的教育。
