Xinhua News Agency, November 11th: The Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry of Forestry, the Ministry of Water Resources of the Central People's Government, the North China Administrative Committee's Bureau of Agriculture, Forestry and Water Resources, the Beijing Municipal People's Government's Bureau of Agriculture and Forestry, Beijing Agricultural University, and other units jointly invited Beloshapko, a member of the Soviet cultural workers delegation and the head of the Department of Agriculture at the Timiryazev Agricultural Academy, to hold a symposium on the issue of Soviet agricultural collectivization on the afternoon of the 10th. More than 40 people attended the symposium, including the heads and key staff members of various units, experts, and professors.

    The symposium was presided over by Zhang Linchi, Deputy Minister of Agriculture of the Central People's Government. Beloshapko answered various questions raised by the units regarding Soviet agricultural collectivization.

    Beloshapko first introduced in detail the path that Soviet agricultural collectivization had taken. She said: Twenty years ago, under the call and leadership of the Bolshevik Party, millions of farmers resolutely embarked on the road of collectivization. Millions of individual farmers have been transformed into collective farmers, who can utilize the achievements of modern agricultural science on the basis of public property and common labor. The leadership of the Bolshevik Party and the state's assistance to collective farms guaranteed the transition of Soviet agriculture from preparation for collectivization to comprehensive collectivization. She cited the report made by Malenkov on behalf of the Central Committee of the Party at the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks), pointing out that the collective farm system in the Soviet Union has been consolidated and has greatly developed. During the difficult years of the war, collective farms completed the task of continuously supplying the state with grain and raw materials; in the post-war period, the merger of collective farms has been of particular significance for consolidating the collective farm system. The Soviet Union now has more than 97,000 large collective farms, which in 1949 were more than 254,000 small collective farms.

    Beloshapko spoke about the rapid recovery and development of Soviet agriculture in a very short period after the war, with agricultural products exceeding pre-war levels and the grain problem being completely resolved; now, according to the new five-year plan—the Fifth Five-Year Plan—it is necessary to develop grass-arable rotation systems and expand the cultivation area of industrial raw material crops and feed crops. She said: All the achievements in post-war agriculture guarantee the possibility of completing even greater tasks in the future.

    Implementing and promoting the achievements of agricultural science and the experiences in production practice has become one of the important daily tasks of the state in the Soviet Union. Beloshapko said: All levels of government in the Soviet Union have specialized agencies responsible for collecting scientific achievements and the experiences of agricultural workers in various regions, sorting them out, and promoting them, while also carrying out work to improve the technical level of cadres. In each collective farm, there is an agricultural crop museum. In addition to engaging in production, ordinary members conduct experimental research in the museum with the help of local scientific workers. In recent years, collective farms have established three-year training courses that do not detach members from production in order to improve the technical level of the members. This year, more than 3 million collective farm members across the Soviet Union are studying in such training courses. In addition, reports and films also play a very important role in promoting scientific achievements and advanced experiences. Therefore, Soviet scientific workers and agricultural workers actively participate in these tasks.

    The close integration of theory and practice is the superior educational policy of socialism and is also a matter of particular concern to Chinese agricultural educators. Beloshapko also gave a detailed answer to this question. She cited her own Timiryazev Agricultural Academy as an example: students begin internships from the first year. The first-year internship begins in the spring, and students intern in nearby state-owned farms to practice spring plowing and sowing, which lasts for seven weeks. During the second-year internship, students are assigned to various tractor teams in tractor stations to practice autumn plowing, autumn planting, and grass cutting, so that each student has the opportunity to gain a comprehensive knowledge of the use and maintenance of machinery. In the third year, they are assigned to collective farms for a four-and-a-half-month internship. In the fourth year, students intern as agricultural technicians for five months. During the internship, in the first year, professors provide on-site explanations of the significance of each agricultural technology. After that, the school formulates an internship plan each year, and the students submit a summary report to the school at the end of the internship. The summary report of the final year serves as the graduation thesis.

    Beloshapko said: Only by conducting theoretical education while also carrying out serious internships can we cultivate excellent agricultural experts. Only in this way can students participate in production without fear after graduation.

    Beloshapko also answered questions about the democratic management methods of collective farms, the socialist distribution principle of remuneration according to labor for agricultural and sideline income, whether collective farms are moving towards specialization, and other issues.

    别洛沙普柯解答有关苏联农业集体化问题
    【新华社十一日讯】中央人民政府农业部、林业部、水利部和华北行政委员会农林水利局、北京市人民政府农林局、北京农业大学等单位，在十日下午，联合邀请苏联文化工作者代表团团员、蒂米利亚泽夫农业学院农业系主任别洛沙普柯，举行关于苏联农业集体化问题的座谈会。参加座谈会的，有各单位的负责人和主要工作人员、专家、教授等，共计四十多人。
    座谈会在中央人民政府农业部副部长张林池主持下进行。别洛沙普柯分别解答各单位所提出的有关苏联农业集体化的各项问题。
    别洛沙普柯首先详细地介绍了苏联农业集体化所走过的道路。她说：苏联在二十年以前，在布尔什维克党的号召和领导下，数百万农民坚决地走上了集体化的道路。数百万个体的农民已变成为集体农民，他们可以在公有财产和共同劳动的基础上，利用现代农业科学上的成就。布尔什维克党的领导和国家对集体农庄的帮助，保证了苏联农业从准备集体化过渡到全面集体化。她引证苏联共产党（布）第十九次代表大会上马林科夫代表党中央委员会所作的报告，指出在苏联集体农庄制度已经得到巩固，并有很大的发展。在战争的艰苦岁月中，集体农庄完成了不断供给国家粮食和原料的任务；在战后，集体农庄的合并对巩固集体农庄制度有特别巨大的意义。苏联现在有九万七千多个大型集体农庄，它们在一九四九年还是二十五万四千多个小型集体农庄。
    别洛沙普柯谈到苏联农业在战后很短期间迅速恢复和发展，农产品已超过战前水平，粮食问题已彻底解决；现在，根据新的五年计划——第五个五年计划，必须发展草田轮作制，扩大工业原料作物、饲料作物等的栽培面积。她说：所有在战后农业上的成就，保证了今后有可能完成更大的任务。
    贯彻和推广农业科学上的成就与生产实践中的经验，在苏联已成为国家日常的重要工作之一。别洛沙普柯说：苏联的各级政府中都设有专门的机构，负责收集各地科学上的成就和各地农业工作者的经验，将其整理推广，同时也进行提高干部技术水平的工作。在各集体农庄里，都设有农业作物馆，一般庄员除了从事生产外，便在当地科学工作者的帮助下，在馆内进行试验研究工作。近年来，各集体农庄都设立了不脱离生产的三年制的训练班，以提高庄员的技术水平。今年苏联全国在这种训练班学习的集体农庄庄员就有三百多万。此外，报告和影片对于推广科学成就和先进经验也有很重大的作用，因此，苏联的科学工作者和农业工作者都积极地参加这些工作。
    理论与实践紧密结合，是社会主义的优越的教育方针，也是中国农业教育工作者特别关心的问题。对于这个问题，别洛沙普柯也作了详尽的解答。她列举她所在的蒂米利亚泽夫农业学院时为例：学生从一年级起就开始实习，一年级开始实习正是春季，学生是在附近的国营农场里实习春耕播种，要实习七个星期；第二年实习时，是被分配到拖拉机站的各个拖拉机队去实习秋耕、秋种、割草等秋季作业，使每一个学生有可能对于机器的使用和保养获得全面的知识；第三年，被分派到集体农庄去实习四个半月。第四年，学生便是以农业技师的身份进行实习了，时间是五个月。在实习期间，第一年，有教授辅导在实地讲解每一项农业技术的意义。以后每年由学校制订实习计划，由学生在实习终了时向学校作总结报告，最后一年的总结报告就作为毕业论文。
    别洛沙普柯说：只有一面进行理论教育，一面认真实习，才能培养出很好的农业专家。也只有这样，学生毕业以后，才能毫无畏惧地参加到生产中去。
    别洛沙普柯对集体农庄民主的经营管理方式、农副业收入的按劳取酬的社会主义分配原则、集体农庄是否走上专业化及其他问题，都分别地作了解答。
