Comrade Chairman, dear friends and comrades:

    The "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month" begins on the eve of the glorious festival of working people around the world, the thirty-fifth anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution.
    This is the special significance of our friendship festival. On this day, the people of China and the Soviet Union congratulate each other with brotherly good wishes. The Soviet people extend particularly sincere and warm congratulations to their best friend, the great Chinese people.
    In the distant past, in the era when the Tsarist government pursued an adventurous policy towards the Far East, the Russian people who opposed the Tsarist system always had sincere sympathy for the Chinese people. Now, the deep and permanent friendly relations between the Soviet and Chinese people have united them indissolubly.
    We were deeply convinced of this the moment we set foot on Chinese soil. We, the members of the cultural workers delegation, were overwhelmed with excitement to see the Chinese people welcome us, the Soviet envoys, so warmly and enthusiastically.
    The sound of singing and cheering, the happy faces of young people, welcomes, handshakes - all these are warmly imprinted in our hearts and will never be forgotten.
    I will never forget the middle school students surrounding me, singing Soviet songs in Russian and Chinese. I will never forget the little girl with the sparkling black eyes, who shyly put something very precious into my hands with a smile.
    It was indeed a very precious gift: a badge with a portrait of the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao Zedong.
    Beijing welcomed us so warmly that the winter days turned into a sunny spring. Indeed, we saw the reborn Chinese people, building their happy new life and creating the spring of new China with their own hands.
    All of China's vibrant creativity is being used for the benefit of its people. At such a time, it is a great honor for us to come to China as representatives of Soviet culture, art, and science.
    How well we understand the enormous construction work that the Chinese people have now begun, and how deeply it is etched in our hearts!
    We live in the Soviet Union, and we are implementing a new five-year plan. This plan itself is peace, prosperity, and a secure life.
    The grand scale of the Soviet communist construction project powerfully confirms that our people, engaged in these peaceful construction projects, are not afraid of any enemy threats. Our country continues to adhere to its peaceful policy, and it does not intend to threaten anyone.
    In our Soviet Union, there is no stagnation, either in thought or in action. The creativity of the Soviet people is all for the benefit of mankind. In the struggle for peace and the happiness of the people, the Soviet people have a great inspirer who leads them towards communism: the invincible Communist Party and its great leader and teacher, Stalin!
    The Soviet people, these courageous builders of new things, have accumulated a wealth of construction experience, and they are pleased to recognize today that they are selflessly and friendly helping the Chinese people by passing on this experience.
    The Soviet people warmly follow the construction of the new China. They know the lives of Chinese workers, farmers, and intellectuals. In the past, they were diligently concerned about the heroic liberation struggle of the Chinese people. Now they pay great attention to the achievements of People's China in all aspects of life.
    The Soviet people increasingly want to know more about China and the lives of the Chinese people. And it should also be said that in recent decades, the cultural ties between our two countries have become closer and wider day by day. There are very few departments that have not made friendly contact. Engineers and technicians, doctors and educators, scholars, and academicians all hope to expand the scope of cultural exchanges as much as possible. The exchange of delegations of scientists and literary and art workers has become a common phenomenon. Peasant delegations and worker delegations visiting the Soviet Union have personally seen excellent advanced agriculture or advanced and powerful industry. The great work carried out by the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association has yielded excellent results.
    As for the Soviet staff who have come to People's China to do their utmost to help, they have also seen that when the land already belongs to the people, and when the light of science and art shines among the masses, the great and free China becomes a vivid example of a thriving new life! There is no force in the world that can turn back the wheels of history and throw this outstanding and noble Chinese people back into the abyss of slavery and poverty. There is no such force!
    The Soviet people know and love Chinese literature and art.
    In the last two years alone, the Soviet Union has published a large collection of outstanding works by Lu Xun. These translations are available in Russian, Armenian, Azerbaijani, Georgian, Lithuanian, and Turkmen.
    A new edition of Mao Dun's works has been published. Guo Moruo's historical tragedy "Qu Yuan" has been published.
    After Zhao Shuli's "Changes in Li Family Village" was translated, his novellas and short stories were also published. Ding Ling's novel "The Sun Shines over the Sanggan River" has been published in Russian, Lithuanian, Ukrainian, and Estonian.
    Some novellas, short stories, and essays by Ke Lan, Liu Baiyu, Ma Feng, Xi Rong, Ouyang Shan, Cao Ming, Zhou Libo, Shao Zinan, Yuan Jing and Kong Jue, Ai Qing, Hu Ke, Chen Dengke, etc. have also been published.
    Collections of works such as "We Have Won," "Selected Poems of Liberated China," "Collection of Chinese Short Stories," Chinese folk tale "The Liu Brothers," folk story "Sun Mountain," "Selection of Chinese Writers' Short Stories," etc. have all been published.
    The Soviet State Literature Publishing House plans to publish selected works of Lu Xun and Guo Moruo. The works of Mao Dun and Lao She are also being prepared for publication.
    But this is still not enough. We should publish more and translate better!
    Soviet and Chinese writers are also meeting and visiting each other.
    Famous Soviet literary representatives such as Fadeyev, Simonov, and Ehrenburg have all been to China. Kozhevnikov and Gonchar, as well as many journalists and essayists, have also come to China.
    In the Soviet Union, we have welcomed excellent Chinese writers more than once, our dear friends: Guo Moruo, Mao Dun. We are pleased with our friendship with Ding Ling, Liu Baiyu, and Xiao San. In the Soviet Union, we have met Professor Cao Jinghua, a famous translator of Soviet literature, the famous poet and writer Wei Wei, who wrote many reports on the situation on the Korean front, and young writers and literary critics Chen Huangmei, Kang Zhuo, Xu Guangyao, Chen Dengke, Han Zi, Ma Jia, Chen Qixia, Liu Qing, Sun Li, and Wang Xijian.
    Soviet audiences warmly watch Chinese films, and "The White-Haired Girl" and "Steel Fighter" are particularly popular with audiences. Chinese films are constantly being shown on the screens of Soviet cinemas, and these films have made a strong impression on audiences. I saw with my own eyes that many people in the audience cried when the film about the heroic "Daughters of China" was shown.
    Two famous dramas, "The White-Haired Girl" and "Romance of the West Chamber," are often performed in some theaters in Moscow.
    Actors from Chinese theaters and film studios went to our Soviet Union to hold discussions on Chinese drama and film issues.
    There are large-scale Chinese art exhibitions in the Soviet Union, and hundreds of thousands of people visit the exhibitions.
    Every year, the Soviet people celebrate the new winners of the Stalin Prizes, the masters who have won the highest awards in art and literature.
    When we learned that the female writer Ding Ling, Zhou Libo, the author of the novel "Hurricane," and He Jingzhi and Ding Yi, the two young authors of The White-Haired Girl, had won the Stalin Prizes, we were truly delighted!
    Earlier, we celebrated a group of talented Chinese filmmakers who won the Stalin Prize for co-creating the documentary films "The Victory of the Chinese People" and "Liberated China" with Soviet filmmakers.
    Our cultural ties are expanding day by day, which is confirmed by life itself. The friendly alliance between the Soviet and Chinese people is a truly powerful proof of peace in Asia and the world.
    We are very proud that our dear friends Song Qingling and Guo Moruo have been awarded the Stalin International Peace Prize for their outstanding contributions to the cause of peace. The whole world knows their names; every peace fighter knows their contributions in the struggle against the warmongers.
    The people of the world thank the Chinese people for their great contribution to the cause of peace, because the Chinese people have undertaken many sacrifices in defending the cause of peace, because the Chinese people are fighting so bravely in Korea to defend peace, and this struggle is shattering all the plans of the warmongers who are trying to launch a new world slaughter.
    The Asian and Pacific Peace Conference has just closed in Beijing, and the whole world has reacted to this conference.
    This new evidence of the peace-loving Chinese people proves the magnificent creativity of the people, which cannot be intimidated by any threats or provocations.
    In the struggle for peace, as in all other great peaceful undertakings, the Chinese people and the Soviet people are two reliable old allies, two fighting friends!
    The peace-loving people of all countries look at the love and friendship between our two peoples with trust and praise, and congratulate the peaceful alliance between our two peoples.
    Long live the eternal and unbreakable friendship between the Soviet and Chinese people!
    Long live Chairman Mao Zedong, the great leader of the Chinese people!
    Long live our leader and teacher, the first flag bearer of peace, the best friend of the Chinese people, the great and beloved Stalin!

### 苏联文化工作者代表团团长  吉洪诺夫的讲话

专栏：

    苏联文化工作者代表团团长
    吉洪诺夫的讲话主席同志，亲爱的朋友和同志们：
    “中苏友好月”是在全世界劳动者的光辉的节日，伟大的十月社会主义革命三十五周年的前夕开始的。
    这就是我们这个友好节日的特殊意义。苏中两国人民在这一天都以兄弟般的良好愿望来彼此祝贺。苏联人民对于自己最好的朋友——伟大的中国人民，特别表示衷心的、热烈的祝贺。
    在久远以前的沙皇时代，在沙皇政府向远东推行冒险政策的年代，反对沙皇制度的俄国人民向来就对中国人民抱有真挚的同情，现今，苏中两国人民间深厚的永久的友好关系已经把他们团结得牢不可破了。
    当我们的脚步刚一踏上中国土地的时候，我们就已经深刻地相信了这点。我们文化工作者代表团的团员们，看到中国人民这样温暖地这样热烈地来迎接我们这些苏联使者，我们简直兴奋得无法自禁。
    歌唱声与欢呼声，青年人的幸福的面容，欢迎，握手——这一切都温暖地印在我们的心头，是永远也忘记不了的。
    我永远不会忘记那些围绕在我的身边用俄文和中文唱着苏联歌曲的中小学生，我永远不会忘记那个闪着一双黑色眼珠的小姑娘，她展开笑容又不好意思地把一件很贵重的什么小东西，悄悄地放在我的手里。
    这的确是一件很贵重的礼物，这是绘着中国人民伟大领袖——毛泽东主席像的纪念章。
    北京迎接我们时是这样的温暖，使得冬季的日子变成了晴朗的春天。的确，我们看到了复生的中国人民，他们在建设自己幸福的新生活，他们在亲手创造新中国的春天。
    中国所有的生动的创造力都在用来为本国人民谋福利，在这样的时候，能使我们以苏联文化、艺术、科学代表者的资格来到中国，这对于我们来说，是莫大的荣幸。
    中国人民目前已开始进行的巨大建设工作，我们是如何地了解这一点啊，在我们的心坎上又是刻划得如何的多啊！
    我们住在苏联，我们在实行新的五年计划。这个计划的本身就是和平，就是丰裕，就是安居乐业。
    苏联共产主义建设工程的宏大规模，就强有力地证实了：从事这些和平建设工程的我国人民，是决不害怕任何敌人的威胁的；我国继续忠实于自己的和平政策，它并不准备威胁任何人。
    在我们苏联，无论是思想上或行动上，都是没有停滞现象的。苏联人的创造力都是为人类谋福利。苏联人民在和平与人民幸福的斗争当中，有引导他们走向共产主义的伟大鼓舞者，这就是不可被战胜的共产党及其伟大的领袖和导师斯大林！
    苏联人民，这些新事物的勇敢的建设者们，已经积累了丰富的建设经验，他们在今天也是愉快地认识到，他们把这种经验传授给中国人民，也就是大公无私地、友好地帮助着中国人民。
    苏联人民满腔热忱地注视着新中国的建设事业。他们知道中国工人、农民、知识分子的生活。过去他们是在内心里兢兢业业地关注着中国人民英勇的解放斗争。而现在他们则怀着极大的注意来关怀人民中国在一切生活方面的成就。
    苏联人民越来越希望多知道中国的情形，越来越希望多知道中国人民的生活。而且也应该说，近几十年来我们两国在文化方面的联系是一天天密切起来，一天天扩大起来。没有作过友好接触的部门，已经非常少了。工程师和技师、医生和教育工作者、学者、科学院院士都希望尽量扩大文化交流的范围。科学与文艺工作者代表团的来往已成为普通的现象。到苏联去参观的农民代表团与工人代表团，都亲眼看到优良的先进农业，或先进的强大工业。中苏友好协会进行的巨大工作，有了极好的成果。
    至于到人民中国来尽心竭力帮助进行工作的苏联工作人员，也看到了当土地已经属于人民所有的时候，当科学和艺术的光芒照射到了人民群众中间的时候，伟大自由的中国就成了蓬蓬勃勃的新生活的鲜明范例！世界上决没有一种力量能够拉着历史的车轮倒退，而把这个杰出的、高尚的中国人民再抛进奴隶与贫困的深渊中去。决没有这样的！
    苏联人民知道而且也喜爱中国的文学和艺术。
    只就最近两年来说，苏联就大量的出版了杰出的鲁迅的文集。这些著作的译本有俄文，有亚美尼亚文，有阿塞拜疆文，有格鲁吉亚文，有立陶宛文，有土库曼文。
    茅盾的文集有了新的版本。郭沫若的历史悲剧“屈原”已经出版了。
    赵树理的“李家庄变迁”译出之后，他的中篇与短篇也出版了，丁玲的长篇“太阳照在桑干河上”用俄文、立陶宛文、乌克兰文、爱沙尼亚文出版了。
    柯蓝、刘白羽、马烽、西戎、欧阳山、草明、周立波、邵子南、袁静和孔厥、艾青、胡可、陈登科等人的一些中篇、短篇及小品文也都出版了。
    作品选集“我们胜利了”、“解放中国诗选”、“中国短篇小说集”、中国民间童话“刘家兄弟”、民间故事“太阳山”、“中国作家短篇小说选”等等都已经出版。
    苏联国家文学出版局已计划出版鲁迅选集和郭沫若选集。茅盾和老舍的著作也准备出版。
    但这还是很少的。我们应该出版得更多，翻译得更好！
    苏联作家和中国作家也在彼此见面，互相访问了。
    法捷耶夫、西蒙诺夫、爱伦堡这样有名的苏联文学代表人物都到过中国。科热夫尼科夫和冈查尔以及许多记者和小品文作家也到中国来过。
    在苏联我们不止一次欢迎过优秀的中国作家，我们亲爱的朋友：郭沫若、茅盾。我们和丁玲、刘白羽、萧三的交情，使我们感到愉快。我们在苏联，见过有名的苏联文学翻译家曹靖华教授，见过写了许多篇报道朝鲜前线情况的有名诗人兼作家魏巍，青年作家和文艺批评家陈荒煤、康濯、徐光耀、陈登科、菡子、马加、陈企霞、柳青、孙犁和王希坚。
    苏联观众热烈观赏中国影片，而“白毛女”和“钢铁战士”特别受到观众的欢迎。中国影片不断地在苏联电影院的银幕放映，这些影片使观众有了强烈的印象。我亲眼看到当放映那部关于英勇的“中华女儿”的影片时，观众里就有不少人哭了。
    在莫斯科的一些剧院中，经常上演两部有名的戏剧：“白毛女”和“西厢记”。
    中国剧院和影片厂的演员们到我们苏联去，在那里举行中国戏剧与电影问题的讨论会。
    在苏联有规模宏大的中国艺术展览会，有几十万人到展览会参观。
    苏联人每年都去庆贺斯大林奖金的新的得奖人，即这些在艺术与文学方面荣获最高奖品的匠师。
    当我们知道了女作家丁玲，小说“暴风骤雨”的作者周立波及白毛女的两位年轻的作者贺敬之与丁毅荣获了斯大林奖金的时候，我们真是高兴极了！
    更早一些时候，我们庆贺过因与苏联电影工作者一块创作了“中国人民的胜利”和“解放了的中国”这两部记录影片而获得了斯大林奖金的一批有才干的中国电影工作者。
    我们的文化联系一天比一天扩大，这是生活本身所证实了的。苏中两国人民之间的友好同盟，是亚洲与全世界和平的真正有力的证明。
    我们亲爱的友人宋庆龄与郭沫若因对和平事业具有卓越功绩而荣获了斯大林国际和平奖金，我们对此感到非常自豪，全世界都知道他们两位的大名；每一个和平战士都晓得他们两位在反对战争贩子的斗争中的功绩。
    全世界人民都感谢中国人民，因为中国人民对和平事业具有伟大的贡献，因为中国人民在保卫和平事业中承担了不少的牺牲，因为中国人民在朝鲜为保卫和平而如此英勇斗争，这种斗争粉碎着那些极力想发动世界新屠杀的战争贩子们的一切计划。
    亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议刚在北京闭幕，全世界都有对这次会议的反应。
    爱好和平的中国人民的这个新证据，证明了人民的宏伟的创造力，这种创造力是任何威胁和挑拨都吓倒不了的。
    在争取和平的斗争中，也像在一切其他巨大的和平事业中一样，中国人民与苏联人民——这是两个可靠的老盟友，是两个战斗的朋友！
    爱好和平的各国人民都以信任和赞扬的眼光注视着我们两国人民间的爱感和友谊，都祝贺我们两国人民之间的和平同盟。
    苏中两国人民间永久的牢不可破的友谊万岁！
    中国人民的伟大领袖毛泽东主席万岁！
    我们的领袖和导师，和平的第一位旗手，中国人民最好的朋友，伟大和敬爱的斯大林万岁！
