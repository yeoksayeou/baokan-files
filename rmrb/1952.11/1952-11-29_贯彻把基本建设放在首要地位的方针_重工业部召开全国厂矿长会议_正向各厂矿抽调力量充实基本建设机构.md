    Implementing the Policy of Giving Top Priority to Capital Construction
    Ministry of Heavy Industry Convenes National Factory and Mine Directors Conference
    Actively Transfers Personnel from Various Factories and Mines to Strengthen Capital Construction Organizations
    [By Our Newspaper] To implement the policy of the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council of giving top priority to capital construction, the Ministry of Heavy Industry of the Central People's Government convened a national factory and mine directors conference for the heavy industry system from November 17th to 20th. At the meeting, Wang Heshou, Minister of the Ministry of Heavy Industry, delivered a report. Wang Heshou pointed out: Under the correct leadership of Chairman Mao and the CCP Central Committee, national heavy industry has basically completed the work of recovery and preliminary construction over the past three years. The production level of heavy industry in 1952 will exceed the highest level in history. The new construction projects and large-scale reconstruction projects of capital construction have become the main part of industrial investment, so the focus of leadership must be placed on capital construction work. In order to solve the contradiction between the heavy capital construction tasks and the weak capital construction forces, effective measures must be taken from top to bottom to transfer the best cadres, technical personnel, and workers from all aspects, especially from the production side, to the capital construction side to strengthen the various capital construction organizations, making them the most powerful organizations in the various specialized administrative bureaus and factories and mines with major capital construction. At the same time, we should strengthen and expand universities, vocational schools, secondary technical schools, geological exploration schools, and civil construction and installation technician schools to cultivate reserve forces for economic construction; we should expand geological exploration teams and strengthen the work of surveying iron, non-ferrous metals, cement, refractory materials, and other resources. Regarding how to prepare for large-scale economic construction, Wang Heshou emphasized that it is necessary to formulate a design schedule, establish advanced technical design quotas, distinguish between the priority and urgency of projects, make construction deployments, expand the fixed workforce, and conduct winter training (including the study of political, technical, and management methods) among workers, technicians, and construction site directors. In addition, it is also necessary to prepare for raw materials, equipment ordering, and training of translators. Finally, Wang Heshou also made explanations on issues such as investment management, financial supervision, design review, summarization and promotion of advanced experience, and economic accounting systems in capital construction, and also used examples to explain issues in capital construction such as adopting Soviet technical standards, paying attention to the relationship between the whole and the part, the whole and the local, and concentrating the use of forces.

    After the meeting, the Steel, Non-ferrous, Chemical, and Building Materials Bureaus of the Ministry of Heavy Industry held discussions separately. Responsible cadres from factories and mines in various regions repeatedly studied and discussed the instructions of Director Chen Yun of the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council, the editorial in this newspaper "Giving Top Priority to Capital Construction," and the report of Minister Wang Heshou. Through three days of study and discussion, they further recognized the significant role of capital construction in national industrialization and deeply realized the significance of "giving top priority to capital construction." At the discussion meetings, responsible cadres from various units, in conjunction with the work of their own units, conducted reviews and criticisms of the views and practices of neglecting capital construction.

    Currently, the various bureaus of the Ministry of Heavy Industry are transferring cadres, technical personnel, and workers from various factories and mines to strengthen the capital construction forces of the bureaus and key projects. The Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant has also proposed "two systems" (deputy position system, candidate list system) and "four methods" (professional training, signing apprenticeship contracts, rotating training for new and old workers, and part-time work and part-time study) to ensure the continuous cultivation of cadres and the continuous transfer of cadres to capital construction positions in order to meet the large-scale capital construction tasks.

    贯彻把基本建设放在首要地位的方针
    重工业部召开全国厂矿长会议
    正向各厂矿抽调力量充实基本建设机构
    【本报讯】中央人民政府重工业部为了贯彻政务院财政经济委员会关于把基本建设放在首要地位的方针，于十一月十七日至二十日召开了重工业系统全国厂矿长会议。会上，重工业部部长王鹤寿作了报告。王鹤寿指出：全国重工业三年来在毛主席和中共中央的正确领导下，已基本上完成恢复与初步修建的工作。一九五二年重工业生产水平将超过历史上最高水平。基本建设的新建工程和规模巨大的改建工程已占工业投资的主要部分，因此领导重心必须放到基本建设工作上。为了解决目前基本建设任务繁重而基本建设力量薄弱的矛盾，必须从上到下采取有效措施，从各方面，特别是从生产方面，抽调最好的干部、技术人员和工人到基本建设方面来，充实基本建设的各种机构，使它成为各专业管理局及有重大基本建设厂矿中的最强有力的机构。同时，应该加强和扩充培养经济建设后备力量的大学、专科学校、中等技术学校、地质钻探学校和土木建筑与安装技工学校；应该扩充地质钻探队，加强勘察钢铁、有色金属、水泥、耐火材料等资源的工作。关于如何做好准备工作迎接大规模经济建设，王鹤寿着重指出：要订出设计进度，制订先进的技术设计定额，分清工程轻重缓急、作出施工部署，同时要扩大固定工人，并在工人、技术人员和工地主任中进行冬季训练（包括政治、技术和管理方法的学习），另外还要做好原材料、设备订货、培养翻译人员等准备工作。最后，王鹤寿对于投资管理、财政监督、设计审核、先进经验的总结与推广，以及基本建设中的经济核算制等问题，也都作了说明，并对基本建设中关于采取苏联的技术标准，注意整体与本位、整体与局部的关系，及集中使用力量等问题，也用实例作了解释。
    会后，重工业部钢铁、有色、化工、建筑材料等局分别举行了讨论会。各地厂矿负责干部反复学习和讨论了政务院财政经济委员会陈云主任的指示、本报“把基本建设放在首要地位”的社论及王鹤寿部长的报告。通过三天来的学习和讨论，他们进一步认识了基本建设工作对于国家工业化的重大作用，深刻体会了“把基本建设放在首要地位”的意义。在讨论会上，各单位负责干部都结合本单位工作，对忽视基本建设的观点和做法进行了检讨和批判。
    目前，重工业部各局正在向各厂矿抽调干部、技术人员和工人，充实局与重点工程的基本建设力量。太原钢铁厂并提出了“二种制度”（副职制、候补名单制）和“四种办法”（专业训练、订师徒合同、新老工人轮训、半工半读），来保证不断培养干部，不断输送干部到基本建设岗位，以迎接大规模基本建设任务。
