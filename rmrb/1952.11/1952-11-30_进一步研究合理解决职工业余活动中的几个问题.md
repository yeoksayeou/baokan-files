Reader's Letters and Commentary

    The regulations of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China on rationally arranging employees' after-work activity time have been effective in six key factories in Beijing—Shijingshan Power Plant, People's Printing Plant, Qinghe Woolen Mill, Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, Beijing Public Bus Company, and Trolleybus Company; however, implementation is not yet thorough. Over the past two months, due to the joint efforts of leading cadres and all employees in the factories, the phenomenon of cadres holding too many concurrent positions has been basically resolved in all units except for the Trolleybus Company, which has not yet resolved the issue, and the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, which has not resolved it thoroughly. All units have also established a system of uniformly regulated after-work activity time.

    However, judging from the reader letters recently received by this newspaper, the current focus of in-depth leadership and research should be on how to further study and resolve the specific working methods and work coordination of the Party, government, labor union, and Communist Youth League at the factory level, as well as streamlining unnecessary organizational structures, after establishing a system of uniformly regulated after-work activity time. This is because these problems are one of the important reasons for employees' numerous after-work activities, long meeting times, and cadres holding too many concurrent positions.

    According to reader feedback, the employees of the second route of the Beijing Trolleybus Company used to attend thirty-six different types of meetings in seven to ten days. These included meetings of the chief driver group leader, joint group leader meetings, conductor meetings, joint group core meetings, small group core meetings, driver symposiums, meetings to promote advanced experiences, Party and Communist Youth League branch committees, small group leader joint meetings, small group meetings, labor union committee meetings, labor union chairman joint meetings, labor union small group meetings, as well as various other affairs officer meetings, reporting meetings, coordination meetings, and discussion meetings, etc. When the People's Printing Plant arranged the work plan for April, the tenth workshop held a total of twelve meetings. These included the Party branch committee, the Communist Youth League branch committee, the labor union workshop committee, administrative cadre meetings, joint Party, government, labor union meetings, expanded cadre meetings of the Party, government, labor union, and Communist Youth League, Party branch general meetings, Communist Youth League branch general meetings, labor union workshop general meetings, and separate small group meetings of the labor union and the Communist Youth League. Afterward, the various work committees of the workshop also had to hold various research meetings. Merely to arrange a month's work plan, a Party member cadre with a position had to attend ten meetings; an ordinary Party member had to attend four meetings. From the above facts, it can be seen that the numerous and repetitive types of meetings of the Party, government, labor union, and Communist Youth League in these enterprises have reached an alarming level. To completely solve this problem, it is necessary to study and resolve the division of labor and cooperation of the Party, government, labor union, and Communist Youth League work, improve working methods, and reduce work levels, rather than simply controlling meeting times and stipulating meeting systems. If these problems are not thoroughly studied and specifically resolved, although meeting times and activities can be temporarily reduced, the problem will eventually occur. The fact is this: in the past, some factories and mines also stipulated meeting systems, but failed to persist in implementing them. Therefore, the leadership of factories and mining enterprises must further study work content, working methods, and working relationships on the basis of uniformly stipulating after-work activity time in order to completely solve this problem.

    Secondly, what should be noted and studied is that some units still have the phenomenon of numerous and overlapping organizational structures. This is also one of the reasons for employees' numerous after-work activities, many meetings, and holding many concurrent positions. For example, the Beijing People's Printing Plant has twenty-five committees at the factory level, including the Party committee, the factory management committee, the Communist Youth League committee, and the labor union committee, as well as the production competition committee, the public security and defense committee, the patriotic health campaign committee, the construction committee, the rationalization proposal committee, the housing allocation committee, the nursery management committee, the spare-time school academic affairs committee, the labor union cultural and educational committee, the production committee, the organization committee, the labor protection committee, the labor insurance committee, the youth workers committee, the women workers committee, the finance committee, the finance audit committee, the club committee, the catering committee, the dormitory committee, and the family committee. A workshop has more than ten committees, including the workshop Party general branch committee, the Party branch committee, the workshop administrative committee, the labor union workshop committee, the Communist Youth League general branch committee, the Communist Youth League branch committee, the production committee, the organization committee, the cultural and educational committee, the youth workers committee, the women workers committee, the labor protection committee, the labor insurance committee, and the mutual aid committee. There are five employees' after-work activity organizations: the dance group committee, the choir committee, the drama group committee, the sports group committee, and the fine arts group committee. Some of the above organizations can obviously be streamlined or merged. Of course, this is not a simple problem and must be carefully studied and handled in accordance with the actual situation and by requesting instructions from the relevant leading departments at higher levels.

    In addition, strengthening the training and education of cadres is more important today than ever before. In order to solve the phenomenon of holding too many concurrent positions, factories and mines have promoted a large number of new cadres. These cadres are mostly enthusiastic, active, and willing to take responsibility; however, they lack work experience and methods. Some workshop cadres at the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant secretly held meetings or carried out work outside the meeting time limited by the leadership because they could not finish their work. Therefore, continuously improving the political and professional level of cadres is extremely urgent.

    进一步研究合理解决职工业余活动中的几个问题
    ——读者来信述评
    中共北京市委员会关于合理解决职工业余活动时间的规定，在北京市六个重点厂——石景山发电厂、人民印刷厂、清河制呢厂、石景山钢铁厂、北京市公共汽车公司和电车公司已经收到了效果；但执行的还不彻底。两个月来，由于各厂领导干部和全体职工的共同努力，干部兼职过多的现象，除电车公司尚未解决、石景山钢铁厂解决的不彻底外，其余单位基本上已经按照市委规定的精神解决了，职工业余活动时间也都有了统一规定的制度。
    但从最近本报收到的读者来信看，在统一规定了职工业余活动时间的制度以后，如何进一步研究解决厂级党、政、工、团的具体工作方法和工作配合问题及精简不必要的组织机构问题，应该是当前深入领导和研究的重点。因为这些问题正是造成职工业余活动多、会议时间长、干部兼职多的重要原因之一。
    据读者反映：北京电车公司第二车路上的职工，过去在七天到十天中开了三十六种会议。计开大联司机组长会议、联组长会议、车务员会议、联组核心会议、小组核心会议、司机员座谈会议、推广先进经验会议、党团的支委会、小组长联席会议、小组会、工会委员会议、工会主席联席会议、工会小组会议以及其他各种干事会、汇报会、碰头会和讨论会等。人民印刷厂布置四月份工作计划时，第十车间共开了十二个会议。计开党支部委员会、团支部委员会、工会车间委员会、行政干部会、党政工团联席会、党政工团扩大干部会、党支部大会、团支部大会、工会车间大会、工会、青年团又分别开了小组会，之后车间各工作委员会还要召开各种研究会。仅仅布置一个月的工作计划，一个有职务的党员干部，要参加十次会议；一个普通党员要参加四次会议。从以上事实可以看出，这些企业单位党、政、工、团会议种类的繁多重复，已经达到惊人的程度。要彻底解决这个问题，必须研究解决党、政、工、团工作的分工和配合、改进工作方法和减少工作层次等问题，而不是单纯控制会议时间和规定会议制度所能实现的。如果不深入研究和具体解决这些问题，虽然暂时地可以减少了会议时间和活动，但问题终久要发生的。事实是这样：过去有些厂矿也曾经规定过会议制度，但并未能坚持执行。因此，厂矿企业领导方面必须在统一规定业余活动时间的基础上，进一步研究工作内容、工作方法和工作关系，以彻底解决这一问题。
    其次，应该注意和研究的，是有些单位还存在着组织机构繁多重叠的现象。这也是造成职工业余活动多、会议多，兼职多的原因之一。如北京人民印刷厂，厂一级的委员会有二十五个，其中除了党委会、工厂管理委员会、青年团委员会、工会委员会以外，还有生产竞赛委员会、治安保卫委员会、爱国卫生运动委员会、修建委员会、合理化建议委员会、分房委员会、托儿所管理委员会、业余学校教务委员会、工会文教委员会、生产委员会、组织委员会、劳动保护委员会、劳动保险委员会、青工委员会、女工委员会、财务委员会、经费审查委员会、俱乐部委员会、伙食委员会、宿舍委员会、家属委员会等。一个车间有十多个委员会，其中有车间的党总支委员会、党支部委员会、车间行政委员会、工会车间委员会、青年团总支委员会、青年团支部委员会、生产委员会、组织委员会、文教委员会、青工委员会、女工委员会、劳动保护委员会、劳动保险委员会、互助委员会等。职工业余活动机构有五个委员会，计：舞蹈组委员会、合唱团委员会、话剧组委员会、体育组委员会、美术组委员会等。以上组织有些显然是可以精简或合并的。当然这不是简单问题，必须根据实际情况，请示上级有关领导部门，慎重研究处理。
    此外，加强干部的培养和教育问题，在今天比任何时期都显得更加重要了。为了解决兼职过多的现象，各厂矿都提拔了大量的新干部。这些干部大都热情积极，肯负责任；但缺少工作经验和办法。石景山钢铁厂有些车间干部，他们因为做不完工作，就在领导限制的会议时间以外偷着开会或进行工作。因此，不断提高干部的政治和业务水平是十分迫切需要的。
