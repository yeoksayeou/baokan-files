    The Tangshan Municipal People's Government Construction Bureau and Other Departments Should Thoroughly Examine Bureaucracy
    Editor: The Tangshan Municipal People's Government's handling of the people's opinions is very slow. For example, Zhao Yuzhen, a representative of Xixinzhuang Village, suggested to the Tangshan Municipal People's Government Construction Bureau on August 18th that a water pump be built in the village. Our committee has urged them ten times by phone and met with them four times, but we were always fobbed off. We don't know when it will be built, but the masses demand a specific reply. On the afternoon of October 20th, Li Shaochang from our committee went to see Lu Zian, the section chief of the Management Section of the bureau, to inquire. Lu said, "After our inspection, we have not received the document..." We asked, why did Jia Youzhi of the section previously say that "we have been to Xixinzhuang Village to see the site for the water pump" when we talked with him? Why did they reply "we will definitely build it in the future" and "we have urged the water company" etc. when we urged them by phone? The bureau had nothing to say and then said "we will study it and deal with it immediately". Another example is the issue of beef and mutton for the National Day raised by the representatives of the Hui people, which should have been answered before the National Day. We forwarded this opinion to the Tangshan Municipal People's Government Industry and Commerce Bureau on September 20th. The bureau dragged its feet until October 6th and replied that "it is no longer timely." In addition, there are eight other proposals that we have urged several times, but they have not been dealt with yet. I suggest that the relevant units of the Tangshan Municipal People's Government thoroughly examine this intolerable bureaucratic style of work in conjunction with the democratic construction of the organs.

    唐山市人民政府建设局等部门应彻底检查官僚主义
    编辑同志：唐山市人民政府某些部门在处理人民群众的意见方面，拖拉现象很严重。如西辛庄村赵玉珍代表群众建议在该村建立水泵，经本会于八月十八日转给唐山市人民政府建设局。我们曾经先后用电话催过十次，并前去面谈过四次，都被应付过去了。何时修建，不得而知，但群众要求具体答复。十月二十日下午，本会李绍诚同志去找该局管理科科长鲁子安了解，鲁说：“经我们检查，来件没有收到……”我们问，为何以前和该科贾友芝同志谈时，曾经答复“已去西辛村看过按水泵地址”；为何在电话中催时，曾经答复“将来一定修建”，“已催自来水公司”等等。该局无话可说了，才说“研究后马上处理”。又如回民代表提出的关于国庆节牛羊肉食问题，应该是在国庆节前答复的。我们于九月二十日把这项意见转给唐山市人民政府工商局。该局拖到十月六日才答复说：“已失时效。”另外还有八件提案，我们已催过好几次，也还没有处理。我建议唐山市人民政府有关单位结合机关民主建设，彻底检查这种令人不能容忍的官僚主义作风。
