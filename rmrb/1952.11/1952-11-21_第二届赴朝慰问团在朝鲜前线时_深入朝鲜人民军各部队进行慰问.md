Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, November 20th: The Chinese People's Second慰问团（Comfort Mission) to Korea, while at the Korean front, went to various units of the Korean People's Army to extend cordial regards, further boosting the fighting will and confidence in victory of the Korean People's Army soldiers.

From early October to early November, some representatives of the 慰问团（Comfort Mission) successively went to various units of the Korean People's Army to extend comfort, and went to the front lines, penetrating deep into the companies of the Korean People's Army front-line units to extend comfort. They conveyed to the Korean People's Army soldiers the Chinese people's determination to support the Korean people's just struggle and the love and care for the Korean People's Army.

The Korean People's Army units received a large number of慰问（comfort) gifts and letters from the Chinese people. Every Korean People's Army soldier received exquisite commemorative albums, cigarettes, towels, enamel cups, candy bags and other 慰问（comfort) gifts. The gifts were printed with words such as "Given to our dear comrades!", "Long live the friendship between the Chinese and Korean people!", "Strike at the American aggressors!" and "The Chinese and Korean people's armies advance side by side to defend lasting world peace!" The words in the letters of comfort also fully revealed the Chinese people's love and hope for the Korean People's Army.

When the representatives of the 慰问团（Comfort Mission) came to extend comfort, the soldiers of the Korean People's Army held grand welcome meetings, expressing their deep gratitude for the care and comfort of the Chinese people. On November 1, when the eighth sub-團（group) of the 慰问团（Comfort Mission), a group of forty people, went to a certain unit of the Korean People's Army in a certain place on the front line to extend comfort, General Li Quanwu, the head of the unit, said at the grand welcome meeting: "With the encouragement and support of the people of the world, especially the Chinese people, the Korean People's Army must work together with the Chinese People's Volunteers to strive for greater victories." The Korean People's Army soldiers attending the meeting presented flowers to the representatives of the 慰问团（Comfort Mission) to pay their respects, and handed over to the representatives of the 慰问团（Comfort Mission) a banner and more than a thousand letters of thanks from the officers and soldiers of the Korean People's Army to the Chinese people.

The cordial慰问（comfort) of the 慰问团（Comfort Mission) further encouraged the courage of the Korean People's Army soldiers to kill the enemy. A Korean People's Army Guards anti-aircraft artillery unit held a forum on November 6 after receiving慰问（comfort) gifts from the Chinese people. Gunner Li Ruihan said: "In order to repay the Chinese people's great internationalist friendship, we must improve our tactics, make persistent efforts, and cooperate better with our comrades in the Chinese People's Volunteers anti-aircraft artillery units to give the American aerial bandits a more severe blow." The soldiers of the Korean People's Army units all expressed their unanimous determination to repay the strong support of the Chinese people with greater victories.

    深入朝鲜人民军各部队进行慰问
    【新华社平壤二十日电】中国人民第二届赴朝慰问团在朝鲜前线时曾到朝鲜人民军各部队进行亲切的慰问，进一步鼓舞了朝鲜人民军勇士们的战斗意志和胜利信心。
    从十月初到十一月初，慰问团的一部分代表先后到朝鲜人民军各部队进行慰问，并且亲临火线，深入到朝鲜人民军前线部队的连队里进行慰问。他们向朝鲜人民军勇士们传达了中国人民支援朝鲜人民正义斗争的决心和对于朝鲜人民军的热爱与关怀。
    朝鲜人民军各部队收到了中国人民赠送的大批慰问品和慰问信。每一个朝鲜人民军勇士都得到了精制的纪念册、香烟、毛巾、搪瓷杯、糖果袋等慰问品。慰问品上印着“赠给我们亲爱的战友！”、“中朝人民友谊万岁！”、“打击美国侵略者！”和“中朝人民军队并肩前进，保卫世界持久和平！”等字样。慰问信中的字句也充分流露了中国人民对朝鲜人民军的热爱和希望。
    朝鲜人民军各部队的勇士们在慰问团代表们前来慰问的时候，都举行了盛大的欢迎会，他们对中国人民的关怀和慰问表示深切的感激。十一月一日，慰问团第八分团一行四十人到前线某地的朝鲜人民军某部进行慰问时，该部首长李权武将军在盛大的欢迎会上说：“朝鲜人民军在全世界人民、特别是中国人民的鼓舞与支持下，一定要和中国人民志愿军一道争取更大的胜利。”到会的朝鲜人民军勇士们在会上向慰问团代表们献花致敬，并把朝鲜人民军将士们送给中国人民的一面锦旗和一千多封感谢信交给慰问团代表。
    慰问团的亲切慰问更加鼓舞了朝鲜人民军勇士们的杀敌勇气。朝鲜人民军的一个近卫高射炮部队，在十一月六日收到中国人民送来的慰问品后，举行了座谈会。炮手李瑞汉说：“为了报答中国人民这种伟大的国际主义情谊，我们一定要提高战术，再接再厉，和中国人民志愿军高射炮部队战友们更好地配合作战，给美国空中强盗以更惨重的打击。”朝鲜人民军各部队的勇士们也都一致表示要用更大的胜利来报答中国人民的大力支援。
