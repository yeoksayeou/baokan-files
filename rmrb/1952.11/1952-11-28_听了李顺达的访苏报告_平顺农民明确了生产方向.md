    After Listening to Li Shunda's Report on His Visit to the Soviet Union
    Ping Shun Peasants Clarified Their Production Direction
    To the Editor: After hearing the report by labor model Li Shunda on his visit to the Soviet Union, the peasants of Pingshun County, Shanxi Province, have become even more clear about the direction of developing mountain production. A campaign of planting trees and autumn plowing has been launched throughout the county. In ten days, 200,000 trees were planted, and 1,370 mu of barren mountains were sown.

    On October 5th, when Li Shunda was returning to Pingshun from Changzhi and passing through Yangjingdi Village (the village of tree planting model Wu Houli), he was surrounded by peasants who had been waiting for him at the village entrance, requesting him to introduce the happy life of Soviet farmers. After returning to Pingshun, Li Shunda gave reports in Pingshun City, Chuandi in the first district, Xingcheng in the seventh district, Hongtigan in the sixth district, Shicheng in the third district, and Miaozhuang in the fifth district. A total of more than 43,000 peasants in the county heard Li Shunda's reports. Those who heard his reports said that it was like attending a political lesson on socialism, which made everyone more clear about the future development of the mountainous areas. Shen Liangyu, deputy secretary of the Communist Party branch of Houjiatan in the fourth district, said: "After listening to Comrade Li Shunda's report, I know that Pingshun has a great future for development, and my idea of going down the mountain has been eliminated." Because planting trees is an effective way to develop mountain production, during the autumn afforestation period, under his active leadership, the masses in the whole village launched a tree planting campaign. A total of 28,535 trees were planted, with an average of 67 trees planted per person, more than twice the original plan. 245 mu of barren mountains were sown, more than one and a half times the original plan. In the past, Han Maifu and his wife in Hanjia Village in the second district not only did not plan to plant trees, but also planned to cut down and sell the existing trees. After listening to Li Shunda's introduction to the happy lives of elderly people in the Soviet Union, they not only did not cut down and sell the original trees, but also planted 68 trees in two days.

    The other districts have also launched tree planting campaigns as enthusiastically as this district.

    听了李顺达的访苏报告
    平顺农民明确了生产方向
    编辑同志：山西平顺县的农民听了劳动模范李顺达的访苏报告后，更明确了发展山区生产方向。全县掀起了植树造林和秋耕运动，在十天中植树二十万株，在荒山播种一千三百七十亩。
    十月五日，李顺达从长治回平顺路过羊井底（植树模范武候梨的村子）村时，被早在村边路口等候他的农民团团围住，要求他介绍苏联农民幸福生活的情况。李顺达回到平顺后，先后在平顺城、一区的川底、七区的杏城、六区的虹梯关、三区的石城和五区的苗庄等地作了报告。全县听到李顺达报告的农民一共有四万三千多人。听到他报告的人都说，这等于上了一次社会主义的政治课，使大家更明确了山区的发展前途。四区后家滩中共副支部书记申良玉说：“听了李顺达同志的报告后，知道咱平顺发展前途很大，我的下山的念头消除了。”因为植树是发展山区生产的一个有效办法，在秋季造林期间，全村群众在他积极领导下，展开植树造林运动。共植树二万八千五百三十五棵，每人平均种了六十七棵，超过原计划的二倍以上。荒山播种二百四十五亩，超过原计划一倍半。二区韩家村韩买富老俩口过去不但不计划植树，并且打算把原有的树砍了出卖。他们听了李顺达介绍苏联老年人的美满的生活情况后，不但不砍卖原来的树，并且在两天内植树六十八棵。
    其他各区也都像这个区一样，热烈地展开植树造林运动。
