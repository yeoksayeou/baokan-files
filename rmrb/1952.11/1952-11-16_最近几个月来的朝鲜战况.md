Recent Developments on the Korean Front
    Li Gao

    The fighting on the Korean front has intensified again since June of this year. The characteristics of the war situation during this period are: the war has always been fought near the 38th parallel, our army's positions are unprecedentedly consolidated, and the enemy cannot advance even a single step no matter how much it pays. In some sections, our positions have even advanced. The number of enemy casualties is increasing month by month. Below is a comparison of the number of enemies annihilated by our army in recent months with previous periods:
 
 Month    Total enemy killed each month    Number of US troops among them    Number of British, Canadian, and other accomplice troops
    Average from December last year to May this year    9,029    4,242    2,966
    June    20,095    11,022    3,827
    July    19,502    8,962    4,918
    August    24,191    10,816    1,6689
    September    30,939    12,924    1,299
    October    63,841    24,884    868

    The enemy's losses in October exceeded the total losses of the enemy in the half-year from December last year to May this year. In the battle for the mountains near Shangganling north of Kimhwa alone, our army annihilated more than 18,000 enemies in the 24 days and nights from October 14th. The enemy's disastrous defeat shocked the American news agencies. On November 2nd, the Associated Press reported on the battle situation in this area, saying: "In nearly three weeks of continuous fighting... the personnel sacrificed and the ammunition consumed by the Allied forces have shocked the Allied commanders, and will shock the public when the total losses are finally announced. These three weeks of fighting are the second-most costly battle in the 28-month Korean War, second only to the Eighth Army's disastrous defeat in North Korea in 1950."

    The Associated Press again admitted in a comprehensive report on the battle situation on the 5th: The American invading army in the battle near Kimhwa suffered "unprecedented losses in personnel casualties and the use of large amounts of supplies, except for the disastrous defeat of the Allied forces in North Korea in 1950. The consumption of materials even exceeds the figures for 1950. The Kimhwa campaign has now become a bottomless pit, swallowing more Allied military resources than any general offensive by the Chinese army."

    The enemy's increasing losses are the result of the American aggressors' deliberate attempts to delay and undermine the armistice negotiations and their conspiracy to expand the war.

    As everyone remembers, after the enemy lost 88,000 men in the "Autumn Offensive" last year, and then was killed and wounded by our army's local counterattack in November by more than 35,000 men, the American aggressors had to restrain their ferocity somewhat. In late November, the US side and our side reached an agreement on the second item on the agenda (the issue of the military demarcation line) in the armistice negotiations. In the following six months, the American aggressors used great force to carry out heinous germ warfare in Korea and within our borders, and attempted to use the air force to destroy our military transportation. However, there was relatively little activity on the frontal battlefield, so the losses were relatively small.

    During the same period, at the negotiating table in Panmunjom, despite the many means of undermining the negotiations played by the US side, all the negotiation agenda items except the issue of prisoners of war were agreed upon due to our side's persistent efforts. By early May, the draft armistice agreement was ready, and the armistice could be realized immediately as long as the representatives of both sides signed it.

    At this time, the American monopoly capitalists immediately experienced "peace panic" because if the armistice were realized, the international tension would be greatly relaxed; the expansion of armaments and the promotion of economic militarization policies in the United States would be more difficult, which would be very unfavorable to maintaining the high profits of American monopoly capital. In late November last year, when the second item on the agenda of the Korean armistice negotiations reached an agreement, American stock prices plummeted once; in April this year, when the United States once rumored that the Korean armistice agreement would be fully reached, the New York stock market fluctuated again. Therefore, the US government, which is solely concerned with the interests of monopoly capitalists, is unwilling to allow the armistice to be realized. As a result, the American representatives in Panmunjom overturned the agreement in the draft armistice agreement on the complete release and repatriation of prisoners of war, and insisted on the absurd proposition of so-called "voluntary repatriation" (later changed to what "non-forcible repatriation"), which was actually an attempt to forcibly detain a large number of our captured personnel, causing the armistice negotiations that were about to succeed to fall into a stalemate. The US representatives at the negotiating table initially yawned and procrastinated; from the beginning of June, they repeatedly adopted the method of escaping meetings for three days, seven days, and ten days, dragging the negotiations down. Finally, on October 8th, they simply used the method of "indefinite adjournment" to push the negotiations into a completely stalled situation.

    At the same time, the American aggressors also intensified their provocative behavior outside the meeting. On the one hand, they indiscriminately bombed the peaceful people and peaceful facilities of Korea, and continuously carried out large-scale massacres of our captured personnel; on the other hand, they drove the American invading army on the front line to intensify their activities, dreaming of exerting some "military pressure". As a result of doing so, the enemy got what it deserved - increasing losses every month.

    The fighting in these months has particularly shown that our army is getting stronger and stronger as it fights, while the enemy is getting weaker and weaker as it fights.

    First, thanks to the active support of the front lines by the Chinese and Korean people, our army's artillery fire has been greatly strengthened. Our brave artillerymen, on the one hand, cover other arms in combat, and on the other hand, directly kill and wound a large number of enemies. In July, our army's artillery killed and wounded 3,200 enemies; in August and September, the number of enemies killed and wounded reached more than 7,900. Our artillery terrified the enemy. On September 7th, the Associated Press reported from Seoul: The artillery of the Chinese and Korean People's forces "attacked the Allied forces along the entire 155-mile front last night and today, and the mortar and artillery fire fired was the fiercest in the 26-month Korean War." A United Press reporter also reported that our artillery shells turned the enemy's positions "into a strange graveyard," and the enemy soldiers killed were "piled up like mountains of arms, legs and heads." The Associated Press also said: "The Chinese army's particularly fierce artillery fire and seemingly unlimited ammunition have repeatedly paralyzed the Allied infantry operations."

    Second, as a result of our army's high morale and the hard training of commanders and fighters, our army's command art and combat skills have been greatly improved. Our army constantly uses flexible tactics such as blocking, counterattacking, and突击 (a sudden and violent attack) to sometimes attract enemy forces to favorable positions and wipe them out in one fell swoop, and sometimes send mobile forces to raid the enemy and "eat" them in companies and platoons. For example, on the night of October 6th, our army launched突击 (sudden and violent attacks) in more than 20 locations, successively occupying 21 enemy positions, of which the defenders of all 16 positions were completely annihilated. This time, a total of three companies, twenty platoons, and four squads of the enemy were annihilated, totaling more than 2,600 people. At the same time, our army's accurate snipers and gunners widely launched a "shooting at live targets" campaign on the front lines to eliminate the enemy with cold guns and cold cannons. This campaign eliminated 3,526 enemy troops in July; increased to 5,716 in August; and increased to 6,554 in September. The snipers appeared and disappeared unpredictably, forcing the enemy to hide in fortifications during the day and not dare to show their heads. Many enemies lost their lives without knowing where the bullets came from. A United Press dispatch on October 28th quoted an American officer named Walker as saying: "...snipers began shooting at us. Those guys can really shoot. They shot at us, but we didn't even know where they were."

    Third, after our army's long and arduous construction of fortifications, our army's positions have become as solid as copper walls and iron walls. A United Press dispatch from Seoul on the 4th also admitted: Our army has "built an iron defense line." Our army's positions are built so solidly and cleverly that in some places they extend right to the enemy's nose, and the enemy cannot do anything about it. United Press reported on October 30th: "The Chinese army's tunnel fortifications northwest of Needle Mountain... extend to the foot of the mountain, and further forward is the Allied position." But "neither Allied bombs nor artillery fire has been able to destroy them so far." In the face of such a strong defense line, even American journalists believe that the enemy's attempt to attack us is a "stupid idea." A United Press reporter reported from Seoul on October 17th: "We (referring to the US military) will suffer terrible losses even if we want to seize a sesame seed-sized hill on the demarcation line." After describing our army's fierce artillery fire and solid positions, the reporter asked himself and answered: "How can the United Nations army brave this rain of bullets and charge through the barbed wire and trenches that the Communist army has spent more than a year preparing? The simple answer is, they can't."

    At the same time, the enemy's conspiracy to carry out germ warfare has also failed. Due to the dispatch of the Chinese and Korean People's Air Force and the strengthening of anti-aircraft fire, the enemy's so-called "air superiority" is weakening, and our transportation capacity is getting stronger and stronger.

    Encouraged by these factors, our army's originally high morale is getting stronger and stronger. The enemy's morale, which has suffered heavy losses, is becoming more and more颓废 (dejected, dispirited). According to American news agencies, during this American election, the only hope of many American soldiers in Korea was to expect the elected president to let them go home.

    However, the American aggressors have not stopped their intention to invade at all. They are now attempting to realize their conspiracy to expand the war through the United Nations General Assembly, forcing the American vassal states to send more cannon fodder to die for the American soldiers. At the same time, they also plan to capture more South Korean youths to serve as soldiers and die, implementing the policy of "letting Asians fight Asians." It is very obvious that the return home of America's lackeys cannot supply it with many troops, and the South Korean puppet army cannot replace the deaths of American soldiers. If the American aggressors do not accept fair conditions to realize the armistice, the casualties of the American army will only increase day by day.

    最近几个月来的朝鲜战况
    李高
    今年六月份起，朝鲜前线的战斗又日趋激烈。这个时期战局的特点是：战争始终在三八线附近进行，我军的阵地空前巩固，敌军无论付出多大代价，都不能前进一步，在某些地段上，我方的阵地还向前推进了。而敌军伤亡数目，则一个月比一个月增多。下面是我军最近这几个月的歼敌数目和以前的比较：月别每月歼敌总数其中美军数英、加等帮凶军数去年十二月至今年五月平均九、○二九    四、二四二    二九六六    月    二○、○九五    一一、○二二    三八二七    月    一九、五○二    八、九六二    四九一八    月  
  二四、一九一    一○、八一六一、六六八九    月    三○、九三九    一二、九二四    一、二九九十    月    六三、八四一  
  二四、八八四    八六八
    十月份敌军的损失，超过从去年十二月到今年五月半年中敌军损失的总和。仅在金化以北的上甘岭附近各山岭的争夺战中，我军在十月十四日起的二十四昼夜内，就歼灭了敌人一万八千多名。敌军的惨败，使美国通讯社也惊叫起来了。十一月二日，美联社报道这个地区的战况时说：“在将近三周的连续战斗中……联军所牺牲的人和所消耗的军火，已使联军的司令官们震惊了，而且若在最后公布全部损失时，还将使公众震惊。这三星期的战斗是二十八个月的朝鲜战争中第二次损失精锐部队最多的战斗，这次损失仅次于一九五零年第八军在北朝鲜惨败时的损失。”
    美联社在五日综合报道战况时再次承认：金化附近战斗中美国侵略军“在人员的伤亡和使用的大量物资上，除了盟军一九五○年在北朝鲜的惨败情形以外，是空前未有的。在物资消耗上还要超过一九五○年的数字。金化战役现在已经成了一个无底洞，它所吞食的盟军军事资源要比任何一次中国军队的总攻势所吞食的都更多。”
    敌人遭受这种愈来愈多的损失，是美国侵略者蓄意拖延破坏停战谈判，阴谋扩大战争的后果。
    大家记得，当敌人在去年“秋季攻势”中损失了八万八千人，紧接着又在十一月份被我军的局部反击杀伤了三万五千多人之后，美国侵略者不得不把它的凶焰稍为收敛一下。十一月下旬，美方和我方在停战谈判中就第二项议程（军事分界线问题）达成了协议。以后的六个月中，美国侵略者用很大力量在朝鲜和我国境内进行万恶的细菌战并妄想用空军破坏我方军事交通，但在正面战场上的活动比较少，所以损失也比较小。
    同一时期，在板门店的谈判桌上，尽管美方玩了许多破坏谈判的手段，但是由于我方的坚持努力，全部谈判议程除战俘问题外，都达成了协议。到五月初旬，停战协定的草案都准备好了，只要双方代表签上字，停战立刻就能实现。
    这时候，美国的垄断资本家们立刻发生了“和平恐慌”，因为如果停战实现，国际间的紧张局势就会大为松弛；美国扩张军备和经济军事化政策的推行，困难也会更多，这对维持美国垄断资本的高额利润是很不利的。去年十一月下旬，当朝鲜停战谈判第二项议程达成协议时，美国的股票价格曾猛跌一次；今年四月，美国一度谣传朝鲜停战协议将全部达成，纽约的股票市场又一度波动。所以，专为垄断资本家的利益打算的美国政府，是不肯让停战实现的。于是，板门店的美国代表推翻停战协定草案中关于全部释放与遣返战俘的协议，坚持名为
    “自愿遣返”（后来又改为什么“不强迫遣返”）实际上是企图用武力扣留大批我方被俘人员的荒谬主张，使功亏一篑的停战谈判陷入僵局。美方代表在谈判桌上起初是打呵欠、磨洋工；六月初起，更连续采取三天、七天、十天地逃会的办法，把谈判拖下去。最后，到十月八日，他们索性用“无限期休会”的办法把谈判推入完全停顿的局面。
    同时，美国侵略者在会外的挑衅行为也加紧了。一面是滥炸朝鲜的和平人民与和平设备，并不断地大规模屠杀我方被俘人员；另一面是在战线上驱迫美国侵略军加紧活动，梦想施用什么“军事压力”。这样做的结果，敌人得到了它所应得的东西——每月增加的损失。
    这几个月的战斗，特别显示出来我军是越战越强，而敌人是越战越弱了。
    第一，由于中朝人民积极支援前线，我军的炮火极大地加强了。神勇的我军炮兵，一面掩护其他兵种作战，一面又直接杀伤了大量敌人。七月份，我军炮兵杀伤了敌人三千二百人；八、九两月杀伤敌人都达七千九百名以上。我军的大炮把敌人打得心惊胆战。九月七日，美联社从汉城发出的消息报道说：中朝人民部队的大炮在“昨夜和今天袭击一百五十五哩长战线全线的联军部队，发射的迫击炮和大炮炮火，是历时二十六个月的朝鲜战争中最猛烈的”。合众社的记者也报道说：我军的炮弹把敌人的阵地“搞得像一块奇怪的墓地”，击毙的敌军“手臂、腿和头颅堆积如山”。美联社又说：“中国军队特别猛烈的炮火及看来无限的弹药一再使联军的步兵作战陷于瘫痪。”
    第二，由于我军的士气高昂和指战员辛苦练兵的结果，我军的指挥艺术和作战技术大大提高了。我军不断地用阻击、反击、突击等机智灵活的战术，时而吸引敌人兵力到有利地位一鼓歼灭它，时而派出机动兵力突袭敌人，把敌人成连、成排地“吃掉”。例如十月六日夜间，我军在二十多处发动突袭，先后占领敌人阵地二十一处，其中十六处阵地的守敌都全部被歼。这次共歼敌三个连、二十个排、四个班全部，共二千六百多人。同时，我军百发百中的狙击手和炮手们，在前沿阵地上广泛展开了用冷枪冷炮消灭敌人的“打活靶”运动。这个运动在七月份消灭了敌军三千五百二十六人；八月份增加到五千七百十六人；九月份又增加到六千五百五十四人。狙击手们神出鬼没，打得敌人白天躲在工事里不敢露头。许多敌人送了命还不知道枪弹是从那儿打来的。合众社十月二十八日电讯引一个名叫瓦克的美国军官的话说：“……狙击兵开始向我们射击。那些家伙真会射击。他们向我们开枪，可是我们连他们在什么地方都不知道。”
    第三，经过我军长期地、艰苦地构筑工事，我军的阵地已经像铜墙铁壁似地巩固。合众社四日在汉城发的电讯里也承认：我军已“筑成了一条铁的防线”。我军的阵地筑得那样坚固和巧妙，有的地方一直伸到敌人鼻子跟前敌人也无法奈何它。合众社在十月三十日报道说：“针尖山西北的中国军队的坑道工事……延伸到山坡脚，再向前就是联军阵地。”可是“无论联军的炸弹或炮火到现在都没有能摧毁它们”。在这样坚强的防线面前，敌人妄想向我进攻的企图，连美国的新闻记者也认为是“愚蠢的想法”。合众社记者十月十七日在汉城报道说：“我们（指美军）就是想夺取分界线上芝麻大的小山，都要受到可怕的损失。”这个记者在描写了我军的猛烈炮火和坚固阵地之后，自问自答地写道：“联合国军怎样才能冒着这种弹雨，冲过共军用了一年多的时间准备起来的铁丝网与战壕向前进攻呢？干脆的回答是，他们办不到。”
    同时，敌人进行细菌战的阴谋也遭到失败。由于中朝人民空军的出动和对空射击的加强，敌人的所谓“空中优势”日益削弱，我方的运输力量也愈来愈强了。
    在这些因素的鼓舞下，我军本来高昂的士气愈来愈健旺。而损失惨重的敌军士气越来越颓废。据美国通讯社报道，这次美国大选时，许多在朝鲜的美国兵唯一的希望就是期待所选的总统可以让他们回家。    但是，美国侵略者还丝毫没有停止侵略的意愿，他们现在正在企图通过联合国大会来实现扩大战争的阴谋，强迫美国各仆从国多出炮灰给美国兵替死。同时，他们也计划更多地抓捕南朝鲜青年来当兵送死，实行“让亚洲人打亚洲人”的政策。很显然，美国的仆从回家固然不能供给它多少部队，南朝鲜伪军也代替不了美军的死亡。美国侵略者如果不接受公正条件实现停战，美国军队的伤亡只有一天多似一天。
