    Learning from the Example of Soviet Intellectuals and Actively Participate in the Construction of the Motherland
    -- Broadcast Speech on the Central People's Broadcasting Station on November 7th
    Wu Yuzhang, President of the People's University of China

    On the eve of the 35th anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution, it is of great significance for us to review the consistent history of friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people, and at the same time, to review the process of progress pursued by Chinese intellectuals over the past 30 years.
    The October Revolution, which opened a new era in human history, brought profound friendship to the Chinese people. This friendship lies not only in the fact that the Soviet state abolished the unequal treaties and privileges of Tsarist Russia against China as soon as it was established, giving infinite encouragement and support to the cause of Chinese liberation; but more importantly, it illuminated the path of the Chinese revolution with the truth of Marxism-Leninism. This friendship was once heavily blocked and hindered by imperialists and domestic dark forces; and in order to break through this blockade and hindrance, China's advanced and revolutionary intellectuals carried out brave struggles, gave rise to the epoch-making May Fourth Movement, and promoted the maturation of the New Democratic Revolution in the womb of semi-feudal and semi-colonial society. After the May Fourth Movement, Marxist-Leninist revolutionary theory spread more widely and combined with the vigorously rising Chinese workers' movement, giving rise to the Chinese Communist Party, which took the Bolsheviks as its example. The Chinese Communist Party led the people of the whole country in thirty years of arduous and tortuous revolutionary struggle, and finally achieved a historic great victory. For thirty years, the Chinese revolution has always received the internationalist assistance of the world's anti-imperialist revolutionary forces, headed by the Soviet Union; in particular, Lenin and Stalin's brilliant instructions and scientific predictions on a series of issues in the Chinese revolution have given the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people invaluable theoretical weapons. Throughout this revolutionary process, the vast number of revolutionary intellectuals in our country were an important ally of the working class, especially those who stood on the cultural front led by the Party and waged resolute struggles against the reactionaries. Revolutionary intellectuals played a prominent role in accepting and publicizing Marxist-Leninist revolutionary theory, spreading the Soviet Union's revolutionary experience and friendship, and introducing the Soviet Union's advanced cultural knowledge. Even during the most frenzied reactionary "cultural encirclement and suppression," this work continued to deepen and develop and achieve victory. Chinese revolutionary intellectuals have always been active propagandists of Marxist-Leninist theory and Soviet new culture; and this theory and culture have also given profound education and influence to an entire generation of revolutionary intellectuals themselves and the broad masses of the people. As Chairman Mao said: Revolutionary intellectuals "often play a vanguard and bridge role in the current stage of the Chinese revolution." "The organization of revolutionary forces and the construction of revolutionary undertakings cannot succeed without the participation of revolutionary intellectuals."
    With the internationalist assistance of the Soviet Union, our country has rapidly and victoriously passed through the period of economic recovery in the past three years, preparing conditions for a large-scale upsurge in economic construction and cultural construction. Concrete facts have educated the broad masses of intellectuals and the people of the whole country, making us deeply realize through our own personal experience that the Soviet Union is our good teacher and helpful friend. In the cause of national construction, it is of paramount importance to continue to learn diligently from this good teacher and helpful friend. With the help of the Soviet Union, our country does not have to work under unprecedentedly difficult conditions like the Soviet Union did in its early days of nation-building. We can learn from the brilliant example of the Soviet Union in all aspects, so as to greatly accelerate the progress of our construction cause. This learning is of particular importance to intellectuals, because in today's situation where there are still very few intellectuals in China, intellectuals not only have to study hard themselves, but also bear a major responsibility for spreading the advanced experience of the Soviet Union. If the revolutionary intellectuals had historical achievements in this kind of dissemination work in the past; then they should carry forward this glory now and continue to create greater achievements. That is to say, we should earnestly learn from the example of Soviet intellectuals and actively welcome and participate in national construction.
    As everyone knows, Soviet intellectuals are socialist intellectuals who have grown up under the cordial teachings of Lenin and Stalin. As early as 1939, Stalin pointed out: "The numerous, new, people's, socialist intelligentsia differs fundamentally from the old bourgeois intelligentsia both in composition and in socio-political features." Lenin and Stalin refuted long ago the reactionary view that only the exploiting classes have knowledge, insisting on cultivating their own new type of intellectuals from the working masses of workers and peasants of all nationalities, and training Bolshevik experts in all knowledge departments. As a result of the vigorous growth of the Soviet intelligentsia, there are now approximately 5.5 million experts who have graduated from higher education institutions or secondary specialized schools. In this year alone, 221,000 young experts have graduated from higher education institutions and gone to work in various sectors of the national economy, and 375,000 young people have entered higher education institutions to study. These intellectuals are closely connected with workers and peasants, cooperate in friendship, and fight side by side for the victory of communism. They tirelessly strive to master Marxist-Leninist science, striving to become people who actively participate in the political leadership of the country. They take Marxism-Leninism as a guide for their work, adhere to the Party spirit principle in all knowledge departments, and do their best to promote the spirit of Soviet patriotism, and wage irreconcilable struggles against all bourgeois ideological remnants. In the post-war years, under Stalin's personal care and teachings and under the great guidance of a series of resolutions of the Central Committee of the CPSU on ideological work, the Soviet intelligentsia conducted discussions on many issues such as literature and art, philosophy, history, biology, pedagogy, linguistics, and economics, which is a clear evidence of this Bolshevik spirit. Based on the theory of Marxism-Leninism, they absorbed the excellent knowledge heritage accumulated by mankind over thousands of years, and at the same time, in an inseparable connection with mass life and social production, they constantly studied new problems discovered in the construction of new life, boldly overthrew corrupt and outdated things with a spirit of innovation, and promoted socialist culture forward, thus presenting brilliant achievements in all aspects. In the process of Soviet industrialization and agricultural collectivization, they helped the country to achieve a consolidated victory of socialism. During the Great Patriotic War, they helped to put the national economy on a wartime footing, enhance the country's military power, and contribute all their strength to eliminate the enemy. In the post-war years, they used the rich experience accumulated during the war, and together with the entire people, completed Stalin's post-war five-year plan ahead of schedule, carried out the great communist construction project and the communist education of the masses, and set off a new upsurge in socialist culture. For example, the discovery of the method of atomic energy production is an outstanding example; 8,470 workers in science, industry, transportation, and agriculture and 2,339 workers in literature and art were awarded Stalin Prizes, which are also outstanding examples. It can be seen that all the great achievements of Soviet construction are inseparable from the labor achievements of intellectuals. They themselves regard this tireless creative labor as a sacred patriotic obligation; and enrich the general treasure house of human progressive culture with their outstanding achievements, making Soviet socialist culture the highest peak of world culture today, providing valuable advanced experience for the people of all countries who are building new lives, selflessly guiding China and the people's democratic countries, and demonstrating a high degree of internationalist spirit. Therefore, they are gloriously called by Comrade Stalin as "salt of the Soviet land" -- an indispensable and valuable treasure, and are respected by progressive humanity.
    Therefore, there is no doubt that the direction of the development of Soviet intellectuals is precisely the direction of our country's intellectuals, and from their spiritual qualities to their work results, they are models worthy of our study. The result of learning from them will ensure that the progressive path and work results of our intellectuals conform to the needs of national development. Because this kind of learning is a major event related to the future of the entire country, we must treat it as a common political task, as the most important content of our own in strengthening Sino-Soviet friendship; therefore, we must not only verbally and abstractly acknowledge the importance of learning, nor can we be complacent with a superficial understanding, but should adopt a sincere and serious attitude, with high political enthusiasm and revolutionary perseverance, and earnestly implement it in action. Otherwise, even with such excellent examples, we will not learn anything.
    Learning from the example of Soviet intellectuals is inseparable from learning Marxism-Leninism and transforming our thinking. Soviet intellectuals are socialist intellectuals cultivated under Marxism-Leninism, while the various erroneous ideas brought by many intellectuals in our country from the old China cannot but produce antagonistic contradictions with the socialist ideological system. Therefore, we cannot take a purely technical point of view on this learning issue, otherwise we will forget the fundamental thing. After three years of learning movement and practical exercise, the intellectuals of our country have achieved great success in self-education and self-transformation. Now, a upsurge of learning Russian in a crash manner has been set off, proving that everyone is determined to learn from the Soviet Union, which is very good. The current task is to continue to deepen and move towards a higher level. In particular, experts with certain attainments must recognize and accept communist thought by following their own path through the achievements they have achieved in that scientific department.
    Intellectuals are generally self-reliant people. If they are thoroughly transformed ideologically and armed with Marxism-Leninism, they can become working-class intellectuals. And if the ideological transformation is truly realized, they will be able to consciously exert greater power to serve the people, promote the rapid progress of democratic reform and national industrialization. Therefore, Chairman Mao said: "Ideological transformation, first of all, the ideological transformation of various intellectuals, is one of the important conditions for our country to thoroughly realize democratic reform in all aspects and gradually implement industrialization." Simultaneously with this transformation work, our country must also learn from the Soviet Union's experience in cultivating intellectuals on a large scale; and with the participation and help of existing intellectuals, cultivate new types of intellectuals from workers, peasants, and their children, so that they can become the backbone of national construction and inject fresh blood into the ranks of intellectuals.
    Intellectuals should also strive to master and continue to master their professional skills, and launch a mass advance towards culture and science, so that we can train outstanding experts in all knowledge departments. In the past, the reactionary rulers of the old China only sought to use knowledge as a tool to rule and enslave the people. At that time, most of the intellectuals suffered heavy disasters, and many knowledge fields were in a very backward state. This backward state is still a burden on our heads. Now, we must use all useful knowledge as a positive force to build a new society. In our era, intellectuals must truly practice the famous saying of Marx that "philosophers have only explained the world in different ways, but now the problem is to transform the world," give full play to their intelligence and ideals, promote the construction cause forward with patriotic spirit, and insist on working hard to catch up with the advanced level, and open up brilliant flowers of culture and science in the land of the motherland. People who lack a business foundation must be determined to conquer scientific fortresses; people who have a certain foundation should continue to study on the original foundation and new direction. It can now be clearly foreseen that through the ways of cultivation and transformation, whole batches of new types of intellectuals armed with Marxist-Leninist thought and mastering advanced cultural and scientific knowledge will continue to emerge and become a significant sign of the arrival of a cultural construction upsurge.
    The great construction upsurge is waiting for us. The infinitely broad road of serving the people and all the roads of creating new cultural wealth are now becoming clearer and clearer in front of us, and all the potential of the intelligence of all mental workers will be able to be fully utilized on the base of great construction. In the face of such a situation, and with the example of Soviet intellectuals and the Soviet people, the intellectuals of our country will work smoothly with the people of the whole country, embark on the road of national industrialization, and prepare to move towards the future of socialism and communism. When the socialist system is realized in the future, the opposition between mental labor and physical labor will be eliminated, just like the situation in the Soviet Union now; and when transitioning to communism, social culture will reach a high level of development, and the essential differences between mental labor and physical labor will gradually disappear. The greatest and most advanced ideals of mankind are about to be realized. There is nothing in the world more inspiring than this ideal. Let us all move forward bravely with full of victorious confidence. (Xinhua News Agency)

    学习苏联知识分子的榜样，积极参加祖国建设
    ——十一月七日在中央人民广播电台的广播词
    中国人民大学校长  吴玉章
    正当伟大的十月社会主义革命三十五周年纪念的前夕，我们来回顾中苏两国人民始终不渝的友谊的历史，同时回顾一下我国的知识分子三十多年来追求进步的过程，是很有意义的事。
    开辟了人类历史新纪元的十月革命，给中国人民送来了深厚的友谊。这种友谊，不仅在于苏维埃国家刚刚成立就废除了沙俄对中国的不平等条约及特权，给予中国人民解放事业以无限鼓舞与支持；而更重要的在于以马克思列宁主义的真理照亮了中国革命的道路。这种友谊曾经受到帝国主义者和国内的黑暗势力的重重封锁与阻碍；而为了冲破这种封锁与阻碍，中国先进的、革命的知识分子进行过勇敢的斗争，产生了划时代的“五四”运动，促使新民主主义革命在半封建、半殖民地社会的母体内孕育成熟。“五四”运动以后，马克思列宁主义革命理论更广泛地传播开来，与蓬勃兴起的中国工人运动相结合，产生了以布尔什维克为榜样的中国共产党。中国共产党领导着全国人民进行了三十年艰苦曲折的革命斗争，终于取得了历史性的伟大胜利。三十年来，中国革命始终都得到以苏联为首的世界反帝国主义革命力量的国际主义援助；特别是列宁、斯大林对于中国革命一系列问题的英明指示与科学预见，给了中国共产党与中国人民以难以估价的理论武器。在这整个革命过程中，我国广大的革命知识分子都是工人阶级的一个重要同盟军，尤其是站在党所领导的文化战线上与反动派作了坚决的斗争。革命的知识分子在接受与宣扬马克思列宁主义革命理论、传播苏联的革命经验和友谊、介绍苏联先进的文化知识等事业上，更起着突出的作用。即使在反动的“文化围剿”最疯狂的时候，这种工作仍然是不断深入发展和取得胜利。中国的革命知识分子从来就是马克思列宁主义理论与苏联新文化的积极宣传者；而这种理论与文化也给予了整个一代的革命知识分子自己和广大人民以深刻的教育和影响。正如毛主席所说的那样：革命知识分子“在现阶段的中国革命中常常起着先锋的和桥梁的作用。”“革命力量的组织和革命事业的建设，离开革命的知识分子的参加，是不能成功的。”
    在苏联国际主义的援助下，三年来我国迅速地和胜利地度过了经济恢复时期，为大规模的经济建设与文化建设高潮准备了条件。具体的事实教育了广大的知识分子和全国人民，使我们通过自己的切身经验而深深体会到：苏联乃是我们的良师益友。在国家建设事业当中，继续努力向这个良师益友学习是有着头等重要意义的事情。有了苏联的帮助，我国就不必像苏联自己建国初期那样在史无先例的困难条件下工作，我们在各方面都可以学习苏联这个光辉的榜样，而使建设事业大大加速前进。这种学习，对于知识分子有着特殊的重要性，因为在今天中国知识分子还很少的状况下，知识分子不但要自己学好，还担负着传播苏联先进经验的一份主要责任。如果说革命的知识分子过去在这种传播工作上曾经有着历史的功绩；那么现在就应该发扬这种光荣，继续创造更大的功绩。也就是说，应该认真地学习苏联知识分子的榜样，积极迎接和参加国家建设。
    大家知道，苏联的知识分子是在列宁、斯大林的亲切教导下成长起来的社会主义的知识分子。早在一九三九年，斯大林就曾经指出过：“人数众多的，新的，人民的，社会主义的知识界，它无论按成份或社会政治面貌来说，都是根本和旧时资产阶级知识界不同的。”列宁、斯大林很早就驳斥了那些认为只有剥削阶级才有知识的反动观点，坚持从各民族的工农劳动群众中培养出自己的新型知识分子，在所有的知识部门中都锻炼出布尔什维克专家。苏联知识分子的队伍蓬勃增长的结果，到现在已经有了大约五百五十万从高等学校或中等专科学校毕业的专家，仅仅今年一年之中，就有二十二万
    一千名青年专家从高等学校毕业到国民经济的各部门去工作，同时有三十七万五千名青年进入高等学校学习。这些知识分子与工人、农民血肉相连，友爱合作，并肩地为争取共产主义的胜利而斗争。他们不倦地努力精通马克思列宁主义科学，力求成为积极参加国家政治领导工作的人。他们以马克思列宁主义作为工作的指针，坚持在一切知识部门中的党性原则，尽力发扬苏维埃爱国主义精神，与一切资产阶级的思想残余作不调和的斗争。在战后年代中，苏联知识界在斯大林的亲自关怀与教导下和联共中央关于思想工作的一系列决议的伟大指导下，进行了关于文艺、哲学、历史、生物学、教育学、语言学、经济学等许多问题的讨论，就是这种布尔什维克精神的明证。他们依据着马克思列宁主义的理论，吸收了人类在数千年来积累下来的优秀的知识遗产，同时在与群众生活和社会生产的不可分离的联系中，不断地钻研从新生活的建设中所发现的新问题，以革新精神勇敢地推翻陈腐过时的东西，把社会主义文化推向前进，因而在各方面都呈现出光辉的成就。在苏维埃国家工业化和农业集体化过程中，他们帮助国家使社会主义获得巩固的胜利。在伟大卫国战争时期，他们协助将国民经济转上战时轨道，增强国家军事威力，贡献自己的一切力量去消灭敌人。在战后年代中，他们运用战时所积累的丰富经验，和全体人民一道提前完成了斯大林战后五年计划，进行着伟大的共产主义建设工程和人民群众的共产主义教育，掀起了社会主义文化的新高涨。例如原子能生产方法的发现就是一个杰出例证；有八千四百七十位科学、工业、运输、农业工作者和二千三百三十九位文艺工作者荣获了斯大林奖金，也是杰出的例证。可以看到：苏联建设的所有伟大成就都是和知识分子的劳动功绩分不开的。他们自己则以这种不遗余力的创造性劳动作为神圣的爱国主义义务；并且以自己的卓越成绩来丰富人类进步文化的总宝库，使苏维埃社会主义文化成为今日世界文化的最高峰，为各国建设新生活的人民提供了宝贵的先进经验，无私地指导中国和人民民主国家，表现了高度的国际主义精神。因此，他们光荣地被斯大林同志称呼为“苏联土地上的盐”——不可缺少的宝贵财富，同时受到进步人类的敬佩与尊重。
    所以，毫无疑问，苏联知识分子发展的方向正是我国知识分子的方向，从他们的精神品质到工作成果，都是值得我们学习的模范。向他们学习的结果，将保证我们知识分子的进步道路和工作成果都符合于国家发展的需要。由于这种学习乃是关系着整个国家前途的大事，因此，我们必须把它当作一种共同的政治任务，当作我们自己在加强中苏友好这件事情上最主要的内容；因此，我们决不能只是在口头上抽象地承认学习的重要性，也不能自满于一种浮光掠影的地步，而应该采取心悦诚服、严肃认真的态度，怀着高度的政治热情与革命毅力，切实地在行动上贯彻下去。否则，即使有了如此优秀的榜样，也不会学到什么东西。
    学习苏联知识分子的榜样是与学习马克思列宁主义、改造思想分不开的。苏联知识分子是在马克思列宁主义培养下的社会主义知识分子，而我国许多知识分子从旧中国所带来的各种错误思想，不能不与社会主义思想体系发生对抗性的矛盾。所以在这个学习问题上不能抱着一种单纯技术观点的态度，否则就是忘记了带根本性的东西。我国的知识分子经过三年来的学习运动和实际锻炼，在自我教育和自我改造上面已经取得了很大的成绩，现在又掀起了速成学习俄文的热潮，证明大家决心学习苏联，这是很好的。现在的任务是要继续深入下去，向更高的水平前进。特别是有着一定造诣的专家们，更要经过在自己那一个科学部门所达到的成果，循着自己的途径来认识与接受共产主义思想。知识分子
    一般地是自食其力的人，如果从思想上得到了彻底改造，以马克思列宁主义武装自己，他们就可以成为工人阶级的知识分子。而如果真正实现了思想改造，他们就能够自觉地发挥更大力量为人民服务，促使民主改革和国家工业化的迅速进展。所以毛主席说：“思想改造，首先是各种知识分子的思想改造，是我国在各方面彻底实现民主改革和逐步实行工业化的重要条件之一。”和这种改造工作的同时，我们国家还要在很大的规模上，学习苏联培养知识分子的经验；并且在现有知识分子参加帮助之下，从工农劳动人民及其子弟中培养出新型知识分子，使他们成为国家建设中的骨干，也以新鲜血液来注入知识分子的队伍。
    知识分子还应该努力掌握和继续精通业务，向文化科学展开群众性的进军，使我们在一切知识部门中造就出出色的专家。过去，旧中国的反动统治者是只求把知识当作一种统治和奴役人民的工具。那时有大部分的知识分子都遭受到深重的灾难，许多知识领域也都是处于十分落后的状态，这种落后状态甚至仍然是压在我们头上的负担。现在，我们则要把一切有用的知识都利用来作为建设新社会的积极力量。在我们的时代，知识分子要真正实践马克思说过的“哲学家们曾经只是用不同的方式说明世界，但是现在问题是在于改造世界”这一句名言，充分发挥自己的聪明才智与理想，以爱国主义精神把建设事业推向前进，坚持努力地赶上先进的水平，在祖国的土地上开放出灿烂的文化科学的花朵。缺乏业务基础的人，固然要下定决心攻克科学堡垒；有了一定基础的人，也应该在原有基础和新的方向上继续钻研。现在已经可以明显预见到：通过培养和改造的途径，整批整批的具有马克思列宁主义思想武装和掌握着先进的文化科学知识的新型知识分子将不断涌现出来，成为文化建设高潮到来的一个显著标志。
    伟大的建设高潮正在等待着我们。无限广阔的为人民服务的道路和一切创造新文化财富的道路，现在是越来越清楚地展现在我们面前，一切脑力劳动者的所有聪明才智的潜力都将能在伟大建设的基地上充分地发挥出来。在这样的形势面前，又有了苏联知识分子和苏联人民的榜样，我国的知识分子将和全国人民一道顺利地进行工作，走上国家工业化的道路，并准备走向社会主义与共产主义的前途。到了将来实现了社会主义制度的时候，脑力劳动和体力劳动之间的对立将会消灭，就像现在在苏联的情况一样；而到了向共产主义过渡的时候，社会文化将达到高度发展，脑力劳动与体力劳动的本质差别也将会逐渐归于消灭。人类最伟大先进的理想就要实现了。世界上再没有什么东西比这个理想更有无限的鼓舞力量的了。让我们大家满怀胜利信心勇敢前进。（新华社）
