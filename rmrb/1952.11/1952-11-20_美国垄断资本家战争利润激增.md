Xinhua News Agency, New York, November 16th (TASS dispatch): According to investigations by American newspapers, the profits of large monopoly capitalists who supply military orders are constantly increasing.

    The "Journal of Commerce" reported that the net profits of 235 companies in the third quarter of 1952 totaled $535 million ($490 million in the third quarter of 1951). From July to September this year, the profits of these companies increased by 9 percent.

    General Motors, one of the 235 companies mentioned above, had a net profit of $117,984,901 in the third quarter of 1952, compared with $92,207,779 in the third quarter of 1951. In the first nine months of 1952, this company, which manufactures tanks, armored personnel carriers, military vehicles, etc., sold $1,026,000,000 worth of military supplies, an increase of approximately 2.5 percent over the company’s revenue for the same period in 1951.

    General Electric, Sylvania Electric, and other companies that manufacture atomic weapons and electronic equipment and radio facsimile equipment for military use, had a net profit in the third quarter of this year that was 126 percent higher than in the third quarter of 1951.

    In the third quarter of 1952, the profits of the six largest aircraft companies increased by 54.1 percent compared with the same period in 1951. These figures show that expanding armaments and the aggressive war in Korea are the source of billions of dollars in profits for arms manufacturers.

    【新华社十九日讯】塔斯社纽约十六日讯：据美国报纸的调查，供应军火订货的大垄断资本家的利润正在不断增加。
    “商务日报”报道：在一九五二年第三季，二百三十五家公司的纯利润共计五亿三千五百万美元（一九五一年第三季为四亿九千万美元）。从本年七月到九月，这些公司的利润增加了百分之九。
    通用汽车公司便是上面所提到的二百三十五家公司之一，在一九五二年第三季，它的纯利润是一亿一千七百九十八万四千九百零一元，而一九五一年第三季的纯利润则为九千二百二十万七千七百七十九元。在一九五二年前九个月，这一家制造坦克、装甲运输车、军用汽车等等的公司出售了价值十亿二千六百万美元的军用物资，比该公司一九五一年同时期的收入数目约增加百分之二点五。
    奇异电气公司，西万尼亚电气公司，和其他制造原子武器及供军队使用的电子设备及无线电传真设备的公司，在本年第三季的纯利润较一九五一年第三季增加百分之一百二十六。
    一九五二年第三季，六家最大的飞机公司的利润较一九五一年同时期增加百分之五十四点一。这些数字表明了扩充军备和在朝鲜的侵略战争是带给军火制造商亿万美元的利润的来源。
