    Propagandist's Remarks

    New Victories on the Korean Battlefield
    The Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers have recently won a series of major victories. In the two months from mid-September to late November, our forces eliminated nearly 100,000 enemy troops. Among these 100,000 were more than 35,000 American soldiers, with the rest being Syngman Rhee's puppet troops and henchmen from countries like Britain, Canada, and Turkey. The enemy's air force also suffered heavy losses during these two months. Our ground forces alone shot down or damaged more than 1,300 enemy aircraft. At the same time, our forces captured a total of seventy-eight enemy positions, with more than a dozen of them still in our hands. Despite launching numerous attacks on our forces, the enemy failed to capture even a small hilltop defended by one of our squads.
    The significance of this new victory is extremely important. Because the Seventh Session of the United Nations General Assembly was held in New York starting in mid-October, the American aggressors had long concocted a scheme before the meeting. They planned to pressure their accomplice countries at the UN meeting to agree to their methods of delaying and sabotaging the Korean armistice negotiations, and to send more cannon fodder to expand the Korean War. To achieve this goal, they first used the method of "indefinite adjournment" on October 8th to completely interrupt the Korean armistice negotiations. On the other hand, they ordered the American invading forces on the Korean front to intensify their activities, dreaming of winning a victory to embolden their accomplice countries and encourage them to increase their troop deployments.
    This scheme was quickly seen through by our forces. From the beginning of this battle in mid-September, our forces proactively launched a series of counterattacks against the enemy, continuously capturing enemy positions and wiping out enemy troops by platoons and companies. For example, on October 6th, our forces captured twenty-one enemy positions overnight, completely annihilating the defending enemy at sixteen of them, and eliminating more than 2,600 enemies in total. From October 6th to 8th, our forces captured an important enemy position (which the enemy called "White Horse Mountain") in the Yaoshan Cave area northwest of Tieyuan, and then continuously repelled the enemy's counterattacks, eliminating more than 8,000 enemies in this small position in nine days.
    The enemy, being beaten everywhere, launched a relatively large-scale offensive starting on October 14th. They used more than two divisions of troops and over one hundred tanks to attack two hilltops near Shangganling, north of Jinhua, which were defended by our forces. Van Fleet, the commander of the Eighth Army of the American invading forces in Korea, personally went to the front line to organize this offensive and sent Jenkins, the commander of the Ninth Army Corps of the United States, to command it. The American news agencies boasted that this was "the most violent offensive launched against the main defense line of the Chinese army in the past year." In fact, these two hilltop positions were not large, only defended by two companies of our forces. However, the enemy attacked back and forth for more than a month without being able to advance an inch. The American 7th Division and the Rhee puppet 2nd Division were beaten and routed, the commander of the Rhee puppet 2nd Division was removed from his post, and the American 25th Division and the Rhee puppet 9th Division were sent to attack again, but it was the same result. Sometimes the enemy concentrated four or five battalions of troops for an assault, attacking again and again if they failed once, sometimes attacking twenty or thirty times, all ending with death and injury, with the remaining people crawling back. In order to attack these two hilltops, the enemy even used the artillery reserve force of the US Eighth Army, which they rarely used, firing an average of 24,000 shells per day, with a maximum of 300,000 shells in one day. The enemy sent an average of more than sixty sorties of aircraft per day to these two hilltops, with as many as 250 sorties on one day, dropping more than 500 bombs. But the result was not capturing the positions, but dying in vain. In more than a month, the enemy lost more than 20,000 people in this small position. American news agencies sadly said: This was "the largest casualty in a single battle since the Korean War," and "the second largest loss of elite troops in the twenty-eight-month Korean War, second only to the Eighth Army's disastrous defeat in North Korea in 1950."
    From the victories of these two months, especially the victories in Shangganling and White Horse Mountain areas, we can see that our forces on the Korean battlefield are becoming stronger with each battle. They have learned how to fight positional warfare well in modern warfare – able to attack and able to defend. When attacking, they can break through, and when defending, they can hold. With a word to attack, they can capture more than twenty enemy positions overnight. With a word to defend, the enemy can't capture two small hilltop positions defended by our two companies even with 20,000 casualties. This means that our positions in Korea are more solid than copper walls and iron ramparts, and our victory is as solid as copper walls and iron ramparts.
    In achieving these victories, countless heroic deeds have emerged among our volunteer soldiers. Many heroes sacrificed themselves without hesitation at the critical moment of battle, in exchange for victory. Huang Jiguang, a young correspondent of a certain unit of the Volunteer Army, braved the enemy's fierce machine gun fire in a counterattack near Shangganling, rushed to the enemy's bunker, blocked the enemy's firing hole with his own body, and destroyed the enemy's bunker, opening the way for our army's victorious charge. Another light machine gun shooter, Chen Zhiguo, encountered a damaged machine gun firing platform in battle. He stood up and used his injured body to support the machine gun, calling on his comrades to shoot the enemy. His self-sacrifice enabled our army to win the victory. The enemy was very surprised by the bravery of our army. A United Press reporter reported that in one of the enemy's attacks, "South Korean soldiers charged to the top of the mountain, but a Chinese soldier stood up, waving his arms and throwing grenades at the South Korean soldiers. He almost single-handedly crushed this attack!" Our heroes were able to defeat more enemies with fewer soldiers.
    Thanks to the enthusiastic donation of weapons by the people of the motherland to support the front lines and the efforts of the comrades on the Korean transportation line, the equipment of our army on the Korean battlefield has been greatly improved, and our army's artillery has exerted tremendous power. The American news agencies, which have always boasted about the power of the American artillery, have recently been frequently exclaiming at the awesomeness of our army's artillery. For example, on October 30th, United Press reporter Randolf quoted the words of Cohen, a company commander of the Canadian accomplice army, to describe our army's artillery fire: "In an instant, the sky turned dark. Artillery and mortar shells rained down. ... Our bunkers were destroyed. Most of our weapons and ammunition were buried under the mud and pillars of the destroyed bunkers. The enemy's artillery destroyed everything." The enemy, who believes in weapons, now often feels helpless. They say: "The particularly fierce artillery fire of the Chinese army and the seemingly limitless ammunition have repeatedly paralyzed the infantry operations of the Allied forces."
    The enemy, who has suffered severe blows from our army, has become even more demoralized. Those hawkish American officers are also saddened by the recent heavy casualties. According to Associated Press reporter Lendoff, "Those Allied officers on the front lines who must order their troops to re-engage in the slaughter are now very saddened to see such staggering losses. Those units that started out as full-strength companies returned this morning with only a pitiful few survivors, and the officers who saw this scene simply cried." Many American soldiers "lowered their heads" all day on the front lines, too scared to fire their guns. According to an American magazine, "about half of the soldiers in the American army on the Korean front do not fire their guns, or do not participate in the firefight at all." The U.S. Department of the Army sent an expert to investigate, and the reason for the investigation was "fear." That expert said: "Fear can cause such fatigue that soldiers are too tired to fight or unable to fire their guns." Many American soldiers were so afraid that they went crazy. According to a report by United Press reporter Penden on November 14th, two American soldiers and a lieutenant officer in a hilltop position of the American army on the Korean front went crazy in eighteen days. The crazy lieutenant officer would sleep under the trenches as soon as he heard the artillery fire, face down, and say: "Are the Chinese attacking? Are the Chinese attacking?"
    Because of the disastrous defeat on the Korean battlefield, the American accomplice countries now dare not follow the United States to risk expanding the war. In the United Nations General Assembly, the United States' plan to pressure the accomplice countries to increase cannon fodder has clearly failed. The only way for the American aggressors to reduce American casualties now is to desperately grab Syngman Rhee's puppet troops to die for them. According to Agence France-Presse, there are now 2,500 South Korean "auxiliary soldiers" in each American division. The American aggressors are also planning to expand more South Korean puppet troops. But the result is obvious: American soldiers have failed, and South Korean puppet troops will only fail even more miserably.

### 朝鲜战场上的新胜利

    朝鲜战场上的新胜利
    朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军最近又一连打了许多大胜仗。从九月中旬开始到十一月下旬的两个多月中间，我军一共歼灭了敌人将近十万人。这十万人里面，有三万五千多美国兵，其余的是李承晚伪军和英国、加拿大、土耳其等国的帮凶军。敌人空军在这两个多月中的损失也很严重。单只我军地面部队打落、打伤的敌人飞机就有一千三百多架。同时，我军一共攻占了敌军的阵地七十八处，里面有十几处一直还在我军手中。敌人尽管向我军发动了好多次攻击，可是连我军一个班守着的那样小山头也没占到一个。
    这个新胜利的意义是十分重大的。因为今年十月中旬起联合国第七届大会在纽约开会，在开会之前，美国侵略者早就想好了一套鬼主意。它打算在联合国会议上压迫它的帮凶国家赞成它拖延、破坏朝鲜停战谈判的办法，并且再出一些炮灰，扩大朝鲜战争。为了达到这个目的，它一方面在十月八日用“无限期休会”的办法，使朝鲜停战谈判完全中断；另一方面，它又叫朝鲜前线的美国侵略军加强活动，梦想打个胜仗，好给它的帮凶国家打打气、壮壮胆，让它们增兵。
    这个鬼主意早被我军识破了。从九月中旬这一场战斗开始之日起，我军就主动向敌军发起了一连串的反击，不断地攻下敌军的阵地，把敌军整排、整连地吃掉。例如在十月六日，我军一夜之间就攻占了敌人的阵地二十一处，把其中十六处的守敌全部消灭了，这次总共歼灭敌人二千六百多。十月六日到八日，我军在铁原西北的药山洞地区，攻下了敌人的一处重要阵地（敌人叫它做“白马山”），以后又连着打退敌人的反攻，九天中在这个小小的阵地上消灭了敌人八千多。
    处处挨打的敌人，在十月十四日起发动了一次规模比较大的攻势。他们动用了两个多师的兵力和一百多辆坦克，向金化以北上甘岭附近我军驻守的两个山头进攻。侵朝美军第八军军长范佛里特亲自跑到前线来张罗这次进攻，并且派美国第九兵团司令詹金司中将来指挥。美国通讯社吹牛道：这是一年来“向中国军队的主要防线所发动的一次最猛烈的进攻”。其实这两个山头阵地并不大，不过是我军两个连扼守的阵地。可是敌人攻来攻去，攻了一个多月，不能前进一步。美军第七师和李伪军第二师打得溃不成军退回去了，李伪军第二师师长被撤了职，换上美军第二十五师和李伪军第九师再来攻，也是一个样。敌军有时集中四、五个营的兵力冲锋，一次攻不下再攻，有时连攻二、三十次，都是死的死、伤的伤，剩下的人滚着爬着逃回去了。为了进攻这两个山头，敌人把不轻易动用的美军第八军炮兵总预备队也拿出来了，每天平均发炮二万四千发，最多的一天打了三十万发。敌军向这两个山头出动的飞机平均每天有六十多架次，有一天多达二百五十架次，投下炸弹五百多枚。但结果不是占到阵地，而是白白送死。一个多月中间，敌人在这个小小的阵地上损失了两万多人。美国通讯社伤心地说：这是“朝鲜战争以来一次单独战斗中的最大伤亡”，“是二十八个月的朝鲜战争中第二次损失精锐部队最多的战斗，这次损失仅次于一九五○年第八军在北朝鲜惨败时的损失”。
    从这两个多月来的胜利中，特别是上甘岭、白马山地区的胜利中，我们可以看出：朝鲜战场上的我军是越战越强了，他们已经学会了打好现代化战争中的阵地战——要攻能攻，要守能守。攻就攻得开，守就守得住。说声攻，一夜之间就能拿下敌人二十几处阵地。说声守，敌人死伤两万多人也不能攻下我们两个连守住的两个小小的山头阵地。这就是说，我军在朝鲜的阵地已经比铜墙铁壁还巩固，我们的胜利也是铜铁墙壁一样巩固了。
    在取得这些胜利当中，我们的志愿军战士中出现了无数英勇事迹。许多英雄在战斗的紧要关头毫不迟疑地牺牲自己，换取了胜利。志愿军某部的青年通讯员黄继光，在上甘岭附近的一次反击战中，冒着敌人机关枪的猛烈扫射，冲到敌人地堡跟前，用自己的身体堵住了敌人正在射击的枪眼，并且炸毁了敌人的地堡，打开了我军胜利冲锋的道路。另一位轻机关枪射手陈治国，在战斗中遇到机关枪射击台打坏了，他就挺身站起来，拿自己受了伤的身体支架起机关枪，叫战友射击敌人。他的自我牺牲使我军获得了胜利。我军的英勇使敌人十分吃惊。美国合众社记者报道说，在一次敌人的进攻中，“南朝鲜军冲向山顶，但是一个中国士兵站起来挥舞着手臂向南朝鲜军投掷手榴弹。他几乎独个儿击破了这次进攻！”我军的英雄们就是这样以少胜多的。
    因为祖国人民热烈捐献武器支援前线和朝鲜运输线上同志们的努力，朝鲜战场上我军的装备大大改善了，我军的炮火发挥了极大的威力。一向吹嘘美军炮火厉害的美国通讯社，近来常常惊叫我军的炮火可怕。例如，十月三十日，合众社记者引用加拿大帮凶军的一个连长柯亨的话，形容我军的炮火说：“刹时天昏地暗。大炮、迫击炮炮弹如雨般地落下来。……我们的地堡被摧毁了。我们的大部分武器和弹药都被埋在毁坏了的地堡的泥土和柱子下面。敌军的大炮把什么都打毁了。”迷信武器的敌人，现在时常感到束手无策，他们说：“中国军队特别猛烈的炮火及看来无限的弹药一再使联军的步兵作战陷于瘫痪。”
    受了我军严重打击的敌军，士气更加低落了。那些好战的美国军官，也为近来的重大伤亡感到伤心。据美联社记者伦多夫说：“那些必须命令他们的部队重新进行屠杀的前线上的联军军官们，现在看到这样惊人的损失，非常伤心。那些出发时兵力都是足额的全连的部队，在今晨回来时只剩下少得可怜的几个残余，那些军官看到这种情形简直哭了起来。”许多美国兵到了前线整天只是“低下头来”，吓得不知道开枪了。据美国一家杂志透露，朝鲜前线美军中“约有一半士兵不开枪，或根本不参加交火。”美国陆军部派了一个专家去调查，调查出的原因是“恐惧”。那个专家说：“恐惧会造成这样的疲倦，使士兵疲倦得不能作战或不能开枪。”有许多美国兵害怕得发了疯。据合众社记者潘登在十一月十四日报道，朝鲜前线美军的一个山头阵地里，十八天中就有两个美军士兵和一个中尉军官发了疯。那个发了疯的中尉一听到大炮响就睡在战壕底下，脸朝下，说：“中国人打来了吗？中国人打来了吗？”
    因为朝鲜战场上的惨败，美国的帮凶国家现在都不敢跟着美国冒险扩大战争了。在联合国大会里，美国想要压迫各帮凶国家增加炮灰的计划显然已经落了空。美国侵略者现在想减少美国兵死伤的唯一办法，就是拚命抓李承晚伪军来替死。据法新社说，每一个美军师中现在已经有二千五百名南朝鲜“补助军”。美国侵略者还在计划扩充更多的南朝鲜伪军。不过结果是很明显的，美国兵失败了，南朝鲜伪军只有失败得更惨。
