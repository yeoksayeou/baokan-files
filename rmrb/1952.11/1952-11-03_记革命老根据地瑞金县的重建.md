    Record of the Reconstruction of Ruijin County, the Old Revolutionary Base Area
    Xinhua News Agency Reporter Yue Gexin
    Ruijin was the capital of the democratic government during the Second Revolutionary Civil War. After the Red Army's Long March, it was frantically destroyed by the Kuomintang bandit gang. At that time, many villages became ruins, and the fields were covered with weeds. Now, in Ruijin County, all the weedy and desolate land has been reclaimed. The farmers are working diligently and happily in the fields. People enthusiastically sing: "Gold and silver are not as good as Ruijin."
    In the past three years, the lives of the people in Ruijin County have been built even more happily than during the Ruijin Democratic Government period eighteen years ago. Farmers have enough cattle and farm tools. Many farmers have built new brick houses on the ruins created by the Kuomintang bandit army. The hard days of "half a year of bran and vegetables, half a year of grain" are gone forever. Last year, Li Yongshen, a poor peasant from Luyang Township, and his family of three, took off their tattered cotton clothes, which they had worn for eighteen or nineteen winters and were patched with hundreds of holes, and put on new cotton clothes. Before liberation, his family ate taro and sweet potatoes mixed with wild vegetables all year round. Last year, even during the "desperate famine" in April and May, they were able to eat two meals of good rice a day. This situation is very common in Luyang Township. Many bachelors who could not afford to get married in the past have started families and are living happy family lives. The farmers said, "Thanks to Chairman Mao for his concern, our lives are getting better."
    The happy life of the people of Ruijin today is the result of a long-term struggle under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. Since the Red Army went north to fight against Japan in 1934, the heroic people of Ruijin County have always fought bravely under the leadership of the Communist Party. From 1934 to 1946, the heroic people fought in the Kuilong Mountain area of Ruijin County; from 1946 to before liberation, the people of Ruijin persisted in the struggle against conscription, grain requisition, and taxation. After liberation in 1949, the glorious people of Ruijin County fought for the reconstruction of Ruijin County.
    Under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, the farmers of Ruijin were allocated land the year before last, followed by a series of restoration and construction works. In the past three years, Ruijin County has newly built and repaired more than 27,000 large and small farmland water conservancy projects, which have freed 70 percent of the farmland from the threat of floods and droughts. Every year during the spring plowing, the farmers of Ruijin County receive a large number of farm tools and fertilizers from the People's Government, as well as guidance from agricultural technicians. This year, all the rice in the county has been plowed three times and harrowed four times, cultivated three times and fertilized twice, with more than 3,000 jin of fertilizer applied per mu. Twenty-four percent of the farmers in the county have been organized, and there are already more than 2,700 permanent and seasonal mutual aid teams in the countryside; in the patriotic production increase movement, farmers throughout the county have generally improved their farming techniques to increase yield per unit area, which is the reason for Ruijin's bumper harvests in the past three years. More than 900 farming households in the county have applied to become "thousand-jin rice yield households," with high-yield rice fields reaching more than 14,300 mu. In the past three years, more than 360 agricultural labor models have emerged in the county, and their exemplary actions and excellent production results have promoted the improvement of farming techniques among farmers throughout the county. This year, the average yield of early rice per mu in the county has reached more than 350 jin, an increase of more than 65 percent compared to before liberation. Now, late rice is growing vigorously, and the farmers are full of confidence and ready to welcome the bumper harvest for the whole year. It is estimated that the total grain output of the county this year will be restored to the highest annual output during the Second Revolutionary Civil War.
    The people of Ruijin County, who have a glorious tradition of struggle, are making unremitting efforts for the prosperity and strength of the great motherland and for the realization of agricultural collectivization.

    记革命老根据地瑞金县的重建
    新华社记者  岳革新
    瑞金是第二次国内革命战争时期民主政府的首都所在地。红军长征后，曾被国民党匪帮疯狂毁坏过。那时，许多村庄成了废墟，田野长着荒草。而今，在瑞金县，野草丛生、满目荒凉的土地都被开垦出来了。农民们在田间辛勤愉快地劳动着。人们热情地歌颂着：“黄金白银，不及瑞金”。
    三年来，瑞金县人民的生活，建设得比十八年前的瑞金民主政府时期还要幸福。农民们有了足够的耕牛、农具。许多农民在被国民党匪军所造成的废墟上盖起了新砖瓦屋子。“半年糠菜半年粮”的苦日子，已永远不再来了。去年，律阳乡贫农李永深全家三口，脱掉已穿了十八九个冬、破了成百个洞的烂棉衣，换上了新棉衣。解放前，他家长年到头吃芋头、蕃薯拌野菜，去年就是在“断头荒”的四五月间，一天也吃上了两餐好米饭。这种景况在律阳乡是很普遍的。很多过去结不起婚的单身汉，都成了家，过着美满的家庭生活。农民们说：“感谢毛主席操心，我们的日子过好了。”
    瑞金人民今天的幸福生活，是在中国共产党领导下进行长期斗争的结果。自一九三四年红军北上抗日后，瑞金县英雄的人民，始终在共产党的领导下英勇地斗争着。从一九三四年到一九四六年，英雄的人民一直战斗在瑞金县的岿龙山区；一九四六年至解放前，瑞金人民坚持了抗丁、抗粮、抗税的斗争。一九四九年解放后，光荣的瑞金县人民，又为重建瑞金县进行了斗争。
    在共产党和人民政府领导下，前年瑞金农民就已分得土地，接着进行了一系列的恢复和建设工作。三年来，瑞金全县新建和修补了二万七千多处大小农田水利工程，使百分之七十的农田免除了水旱灾害的威胁。每年春耕时，瑞金县农民都得到人民政府贷给的大批农具、肥料，和农业技术人员的指导。今年全县的稻禾都做到了三犁四耙、三耘二点（追肥），每亩田的施肥量达到三千斤以上。全县有百分之二十四的农户组织起来，农村里已有了二千七百多个常年和季节性的互助组；全县农民在爱国丰产运动中，普遍为提高单位面积产量而改进耕作技术，这就是三年来瑞金丰收的原因。全县有九百多农户要求做“水稻千斤丰产户”，丰产稻田达一万四千三百多亩。三年来全县涌现出三百六十多个农业劳动模范，他们的模范行动和优良的生产成绩，推动了全县农民提高耕作水平。今年全县早稻平均每亩产量已达三百五十多斤，超过解放前百分之六十五以上。现在，晚稻正在茁壮生长，农民们都满怀信心地准备迎接全年的丰收，预计全县今年粮食总产量将恢复到第二次国内革命战争时期的最高年产量。
    有着光荣斗争传统的瑞金县人民，他们为着伟大祖国的繁荣富强、为着实现农业集体化进行不懈的努力。
