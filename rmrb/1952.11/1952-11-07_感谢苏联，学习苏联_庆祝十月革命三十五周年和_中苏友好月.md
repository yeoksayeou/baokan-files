    Thank the Soviet Union, Learn from the Soviet Union
    ——Celebrating the 35th Anniversary of the October Revolution and "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month"

    The great October Socialist Revolution, marking a new era in human history, is now thirty-five years old. This revolution, under the brilliant leadership of Lenin and Stalin, led mankind to embark on the path of socialism and communism. On this path, the Soviet people have already created unparalleled glorious achievements; our Chinese people and the people of various people's democratic countries are taking the Soviet Union as an example and striving for the construction of new democracy and socialism; the people of other countries in the world are also increasingly yearning for the Soviet Union and the bright future of all mankind. People of all countries who love peace and justice have recognized that the path of the new world opened up by the great October Revolution is the inevitable path of human history. Over the past thirty-five years, all the major changes that have taken place in the world have increasingly proved that the general trend of history must be the death of the old capitalist world and the victory of the new socialist world.

    Under the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong and the Chinese Communist Party, and guided by the revolutionary theories of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, our people have not only achieved the victory of the people's revolution, but also, with the generous and selfless assistance of the great Soviet Union, rapidly achieved great success in economic recovery. Now our people are preparing to begin large-scale construction work. The great Stalin and the Soviet people's cordial concern and selfless assistance are unforgettable to the Chinese people. The Chinese people deeply remember that the Soviet Union was the first to recognize our country shortly after the founding of the People's Republic of China. In February 1950, under the personal guidance of Comrade Stalin and Comrade Mao Zedong, the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance was signed. The Soviet government provided loans to our country on preferential terms and gave our country economic and technical assistance. Many Soviet experts accepted the invitation of our government to come to our country, and in all aspects of industry, railways, agriculture, water conservancy, cultural education, and medical and health, they carried out selfless labor with a high degree of internationalist spirit, and unreservedly imparted advanced technical experience to us. Such profound friendship is unparalleled. The Sino-Soviet Joint Communiqué issued on September 15 this year also stipulated that the Soviet government will unconditionally hand over the Chinese Changchun Railway and all its property to our country; the Soviet government also accepted the proposal of our government to extend the deadline for the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Lushunkou. This shows that the Sino-Soviet alliance is sincere, selfless and unbreakable.

    In his telegram to Comrade Mao Zedong on September 2 this year, Comrade Stalin said: "The great friendship between the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China constitutes a reliable guarantee against the threat of new aggression and a strong bulwark of peace in the Far East and throughout the world." The facts fully prove the truth of Comrade Stalin's judgment. In his recently published great work, Comrade Stalin brilliantly analyzed the characteristics of this friendly cooperative relationship between the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, saying: "The experience of this cooperation shows that no capitalist country can give the people's democratic countries such real and technically proficient help as the Soviet Union. The problem is not only that this help is extremely cheap and technically first-rate. The primary problem is that the basis of this cooperation is the sincere desire to help each other and seek common economic prosperity." It is precisely because the friendly cooperation between China and the Soviet Union is built on such a solid foundation that Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out in his speech when leaving Moscow on February 17, 1950: The complete understanding and deep friendship established by the leaders of China and the Soviet Union "on the basis of the fundamental interests of the people of the two great powers of China and the Soviet Union is difficult to describe in words. People can see that the unity of the people of the two great powers of China and the Soviet Union, which has already been fixed by treaties, will be permanent, unbreakable, and no one can separate it. This unity will not only inevitably affect the prosperity of the two great powers of China and the Soviet Union, but also inevitably affect the future of mankind and the victory of world peace and justice."

    In order to further strengthen the close friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union, it is of great significance for our people to hold a large-scale "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month" while celebrating the 35th anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution. What is particularly inspiring to us is that the Soviet Union has sent a delegation of Soviet cultural workers, a Soviet art troupe, the Soviet Red Flag Song and Dance Ensemble, and a delegation of Soviet film artists to participate in our "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month." Our people welcome our closest Soviet friends with unparalleled enthusiasm. Through the activities of the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month," we will further strive to learn from the outstanding achievements of the Soviet Union in political, economic, scientific, educational, and literary and artistic work, so that we can better develop our future construction cause.

    Our people now recognize the superiority of the Soviet socialist system more widely than ever before, thereby consolidating our infinite confidence in the future of socialism and communism. Our Communist Party members and cadres at all levels should particularly deeply study Comrade Stalin's classic work "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR" published on the eve of the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, carefully study Comrade Stalin's speech at this Congress, study the report of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union made by Comrade Malenkov, and other important documents of this Congress. These documents of great historical significance are the latest sharp weapons in the treasure house of Marxist-Leninist theory. Learning and mastering these weapons will not only reduce many mistakes in our economic, political, scientific and cultural work, but will also cause huge innovations. Every work department, every Communist Party member and cadre should, based on Comrade Stalin's works, Comrade Malenkov's report and other documents, examine our own thoughts and work, unfold criticism, especially criticism from below, and correct all kinds of mistakes and deviations that violate Marxism among us. We thank the great Comrade Stalin and the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, because of the great historical work of world significance they have done, we can avoid and overcome difficulties on the road forward under new historical conditions, and can clearly see the specific path in every step forward in the present and future.

    In all business departments, we must more systematically carry out the serious study of the advanced experience of the Soviet Union. Since our country is under the leadership of the working class, and the various economic components of our country are under the leadership of the state-owned economy of a socialist nature, we have full conditions to learn and apply the advanced experience of the Soviet Union on a wide scale. Facts have also proved that the promotion of advanced Soviet experience has been increasingly warmly welcomed by the people of our country, especially the workers and technicians, and has caused a series of reforms in the production technology and business management of many business departments, and has achieved great results. Many enterprises have trained a large number of activists who understand advanced working methods and cultivated a lot of labor models with the direct help of Soviet experts and technicians. We deeply thank all the Soviet experts who have worked hard in our country. Due to their contributions in practical work, the construction of our country has been greatly advanced. In the future, on this basis, leading cadres at all levels must strive to study and more fully apply the advanced experience of the Soviet Union to the specific conditions of our country, and more effectively fight against backward and conservative ideas, and truly learn and promote the advanced experience of the Soviet Union. During this "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month," all business departments across the country must conduct a systematic inspection of the achievements in learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union in the past three years, make a summary, in order to further learn from the Soviet Union to meet the tasks of large-scale construction in our country.

    Learning from the Soviet Union has now become the common requirement of the people of our country. This requirement is manifested in many aspects. What we want to learn from the Soviet Union is extremely rich, and in order to facilitate learning, we must vigorously promote the study of Russian. This will enable us to learn from the Soviet Union more widely and directly, and will further strengthen the cultural exchanges between the people of China and the Soviet Union and the friendship between the people of the two countries. From their own personal experience, the people of our country deeply know that learning from the Soviet Union is of immeasurable importance to the future of our country's construction and development; we also know more deeply that the stronger the friendly relations between China and the Soviet Union, the more powerful we will be to defend peace in the Far East and the world.

    Today, as we warmly celebrate the 35th anniversary of the October Socialist Revolution and welcome the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month," the people of our country, like the people of the Soviet Union and all peace-loving people, pay lofty tribute to Stalin, the great teacher of mankind. We are confident that under the leadership of the great Stalin, the Soviet people will not only complete but also over fulfill the new five-year plan, making new major achievements in the Soviet Union's transition from socialism to communism. We are confident that the strength of the world peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union and with the Sino-Soviet alliance as its backbone will surely win a glorious victory in the struggle against war and in defense of peace.

    感谢苏联，学习苏联
    ——庆祝十月革命三十五周年和“中苏友好月”
    标志着人类历史新纪元的伟大十月社会主义革命，于今三十五周年了。这个革命，在列宁、斯大林的天才指导之下，使人类开始走上了社会主义和共产主义的道路。在这条道路上，苏联人民已经创造了无比辉煌的业绩；我们中国和各人民民主国家的人民，正以苏联为榜样，努力于新民主主义的和社会主义的建设；世界上其他国家的人民也日益向往着苏联，向往着全人类美好的未来。一切国家爱好和平与正义的人民，都认识了伟大的十月革命所开辟的新世界的道路是人类历史的必由之路。三十五年来，世界上所发生的一切重大的变化，都愈加证明了历史的总趋势，必然是达到资本主义旧世界的死亡和社会主义新世界的胜利。
    我国人民在毛泽东同志和中国共产党的领导下，以马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的革命理论为指针，不但取得了人民革命的胜利，而且在伟大的苏联的慷慨无私的援助之下，迅速取得了经济恢复工作的巨大成功。现在我国人民正在准备开始大规模的建设工作。伟大的斯大林和苏联人民对于我们的亲切关怀和无私援助，是我国人民永志不忘的。中国人民深深记得：在中华人民共和国刚刚成立之后不久，苏联就首先承认了我国。一九五○年二月，在斯大林同志和毛泽东同志亲自主持下，苏中两国缔结了友好同盟互助条约。苏联政府以优惠条件贷款给我国，并且给予我国以经济的和技术的援助。许多苏联专家接受我国政府的邀请来到我国，在工业、铁路、农业、水利和文化教育、医药卫生等各个方面，都以高度的国际主义精神，进行忘我的劳动，毫无保留地把先进的技术经验传授给我们。这样深厚的友谊是无可比拟的。今年九月十五日发表的中苏会谈公报，又规定苏联政府将中国长春铁路及其全部财产无偿地交还我国；苏联政府并接受我国政府的提议，延长苏军从旅顺口撤退的期限。这正显示了中苏友好同盟是真诚无私的和牢不可破的。
    斯大林同志在今年九月二日给毛泽东同志的电文中说：“苏联和中华人民共和国之间的伟大友谊是反对新侵略威胁的可靠保证，是远东及全世界和平的坚强堡垒。”事实完全证明了斯大林同志的论断的真确。斯大林同志在他的最近发表的伟大著作中曾经光辉地分析苏联和各人民民主国家的这种友好合作关系的特征说：“这个合作的经验表明，没有一个资本主义国家能像苏联那样给予各人民民主国家以真正的帮助和技术精湛的帮助。问题不仅在于这种帮助是极度便宜的，技术上是头等的。问题首先在于这种合作的基础，是互相帮助和求得共同经济高涨的真诚愿望。”正是由于中苏两国的友好合作关系是建立在这样巩固的基础之上，所以毛泽东同志还在一九五○年二月十七日在离开莫斯科时的演说中就指出：中苏两国领袖“在中苏两大国人民根本利益的基础上所建立起来的充分了解与深厚友谊，是难以用言语来形容的。人们可以看得见：业已经过条约固定下来的中苏两大国人民的团结将是永久的，不可破坏的，没有人能够分离的。而这种团结，不但必然要影响中苏两大国的繁荣，而且必然要影响到人类的将来，影响到全世界和平与正义的胜利。”
    为了进一步加强中苏两国人民的亲密友谊，在庆祝伟大的十月社会主义革命三十五周年的时候，我国人民举行大规模的“中苏友好月”是有重大意义的。使我们特别感奋的是苏联派遣了苏联文化工作者代表团、苏联艺术工作团、苏军红旗歌舞团、苏联电影艺术工作者代表团来参加我们的“中苏友好月”。我国人民以无比的热情欢迎我们最亲密的苏联朋友。我们要通过“中苏友好月”的活动，更进一步地努力学习苏联的政治、经济、科学、教育与文学艺术工作的杰出成果，使我们能够更好地发展今后的建设事业。
    我国人民现在比以前任何时候更广泛地认识到苏联社会主义社会制度的优越性，并由此而巩固了我们对于社会主义和共产主义前途的无限信心。我们共产党员和各级干部特别应该深入地研究斯大林同志在苏联共产党第十九次代表大会前夕所发表的“苏联社会主义经济问题”的经典著作，认真研究斯大林同志在这个代表大会上的演说，研究马林科夫同志所作的苏联共产党中央委员会的报告和这次大会的其他重要文件。这些具有巨大历史意义的文献，是马克思列宁主义理论宝库中最新的锐利的武器。学习与掌握这些武器，将使我们的经济、政治、科学和文化各项工作不仅会减少许多错误，而且会引起巨大的革新。每一个工作部门，每一个共产党员和干部，都应该根据斯大林同志的著作、马林科夫同志的报告和其他各项文件，来检查我们自己的思想和工作，展开批评特别是自下而上的批评，纠正我们中间的种种色色的违反马克思主义的错误和偏差。我们感谢伟大的斯大林同志和苏联共产党第十九次代表大会，由于他们所做的具有世界意义的伟大历史性的工作，我们才有可能在新的历史条件下避免与克服在前进路上的困难，才能够清楚地看到在目前和将来每一步前进中的具体道路。
    在一切业务部门中，我们都必须更有系统地进行对于苏联先进经验的认真学习。由于我们的国家是在工人阶级领导之下的，我国的各种经济成份是在社会主义性质的国营经济领导之下的，我们就有充分的条件能够在广大范围内学习与运用苏联的先进经验。事实也证明，苏联先进经验的推广，已经日益普遍地受到我国人民，特别是工人群众和技术人员的热烈欢迎，并已引起了不少业务部门在生产技术和经营管理方面的一系列的改革，获得了很大的成绩。许多企业单位，在苏联的专家和技术人员的直接帮助之下，训练了大批懂得先进工作方法的积极分子，培养出来了不少的劳动模范。我们深深地感谢所有在我国辛勤工作的苏联专家们，由于他们在实际工作中的贡献，使我国的建设事业大大地向前推进了。今后，在这个基础上，各级领导干部必须努力钻研，更充分地把苏联的先进经验运用到我国的具体条件下来，更有效地和落后的保守的思想作斗争，真正学会并推广苏联的先进经验。在这次“中苏友好月”中，全国各个业务部门，必须对于三年来学习苏联先进经验的成就，进行系统的检查，做出总结，以便进一步向苏联学习，去迎接我国大规模建设的任务。
    学习苏联，现在已经成为我国人民的共同要求了。这种要求表现在许多方面。我们要向苏联学习的东西是极为丰富的，而为着便于学习，就必须大力提倡学习俄文。这将使我们能够更广泛地直接地学习苏联，并将进一步加强中苏两国人民文化的交流和两国人民的友谊。我国人民从自己亲身的体验中深切地知道，学习苏联对于我国的建设和发展的前途是有不可估量的重要意义的；我们更深切地知道，中苏友好的关系越增强，就越有力量保卫远东与世界的和平。
    今天，当我们热烈庆祝十月社会主义革命三十五周年并迎接“中苏友好月”的时候，我国人民和苏联人民及一切爱好和平的人民一样，衷心地向人类伟大的导师斯大林致崇高的敬意。我们确信在伟大斯大林的领导下，苏联人民不仅一定会完成而且一定会超额完成新的五年计划，使苏联在从社会主义过渡到共产主义的道路上取得新的重大成就。我们确信以苏联为首和以中苏友好同盟为中坚的世界和平民主阵营的力量，必能在反对战争、维护和平的斗争中获得光辉的胜利。
