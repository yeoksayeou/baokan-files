Readers' Letters

    To the Editor: We are readers from the Fifth District of Gaoping County, Shanxi Province. During this judicial reform movement, we listened to the report of Li Tong, the former secretary of the Fifth District People's Government. From his report, we saw the harm of old legal views and old judicial styles, especially regarding marriage issues. For example, when young men Guo Fubao and Li Qilou went to the District People's Government to request marriage registration, they were denied permission three times. Secretary Li Tong said that since the man's two older brothers were not married, it was "unreasonable" for them to marry; he also subjectively and arbitrarily concluded that they were in a "marriage for purchase", and finally said that they were in a "marriage after premarital sex", so they "could not get married". Guo Fubao didn't know how to resist, and in despair, he buried himself alive. Zhang Peisen, the former section chief of the County Judicial Section, examined Guo Fubao's body and said, "He wanted to die himself, it has nothing to do with us." What kind of talk is this! Because of the old legal views and old judicial styles, and the Marriage Law not being implemented, a series of deaths occurred: such as an eighteen-year-old woman in Tielu Village who committed suicide by jumping into a well because her aunt interfered with her freedom of marriage; a woman in Jiuwu Village who jumped into a kiln pit and died, and so on. We suggest that the relevant leaders conduct a thorough investigation into these situations.

    山西省高平县第五区人民政府
    应深入检查婚姻问题方面的旧法观点
    编辑同志：我们是山西省高平县第五区的读者。在这次司法改革运动中，我们曾经听了第五区人民政府前秘书李同的检查报告。从他的报告中，我们看到了旧法观点、旧司法作风的危害性，尤其是对于婚姻问题方面的。如青年郭富保和李其楼到区人民政府要求登记结婚时，连跑三次都未被允许，秘书李同说，男方的两个哥哥都没有结婚，所以他们要结婚是“不合理的”；又主观臆断他们是“买卖婚姻”，最后说他们是“先奸后婚”，所以“不能结婚”。郭富保不知道应该如何反抗，在绝望之下自己活埋致死。县司法科前科长张培森验了郭富保的尸首后说：“这是他自己愿死，与咱没关系。”这是什么话！由于旧法观点、旧司法作风作怪、婚姻法未被贯彻执行，一连串的命案发生了：如铁炉村一个十八岁的妇女因婶母干涉婚姻自由而投井自杀；酒务村一个妇女跳窑坑洞而死等等。我们建议有关领导方面对这些情况作深入的检查。
