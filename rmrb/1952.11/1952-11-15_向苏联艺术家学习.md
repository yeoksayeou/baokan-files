    Learning from Soviet Artists

    The Soviet cultural workers delegation headed by Tikhonov, the Soviet art work group led by Churaki, the Soviet Army Red Flag Song and Dance Ensemble headed by B.A. Alexandrov, and the Soviet film artists delegation led by Fedorov, bringing the great Comrade Stalin and the Soviet people’s concern for our people, came to our country to participate in the Sino-Soviet Friendship Month, making our people feel supremely excited and honored.
    The great friendly assistance given by the Soviet Union to our people in the past three years is immeasurable. Thousands of Soviet experts have made and continue to make great contributions to our construction cause. Now, outstanding Soviet artists have brought us excellent Soviet art, enabling our people to more truly experience the most advanced art of mankind, and enabling our art workers to learn from them more directly. We should express our heartfelt gratitude.
    In the past week, Soviet friends in Beijing have met with our leaders and the masses. They have held lectures, discussions, and visits with our cadres, workers, peasants, students, and women. In particular, the continuous performances by outstanding Soviet artists have given us tremendous enlightenment. From this, we more clearly recognize that we must take the Soviet Union as our best example in all aspects of learning. Learning from Soviet artists is an unmissable opportunity right now.
    The artists of the several groups who have come to our country this time are, for the most part, representative figures of Soviet art who have made outstanding achievements and enjoy high honors. From their performances and talks, we can learn extremely valuable experience everywhere. Whether it is Soviet films, or the Soviet Army songs and dances, ballet, singing, music, etc. they perform, none of them are not filled with a high degree of ideological and artistic quality. It is no accident that they are receiving such a warm welcome from our audience.
    After watching the various performances of Soviet artists, people will find that there is something in common. This is that they are overflowing with the vitality of a life that truly belongs to the people and inspiring people to move forward. For example, the soldiers' songs and dances performed by the Red Flag Song and Dance Ensemble have a special style. It is characterized by being cheerful, lively, and full of vitality and courage. Many performances by Soviet artists are socialist in content and have the characteristics of various nationalities in the multi-ethnic country of the Soviet Union in form. For example, the "Volga Boatmen's Song" soloed by the outstanding Soviet singer Mikhailov fully expresses the magnificent and firm character of the working people of the great Russian nation. Another example is "Uzbek Girl's Song of Peace" soloed by Naserova and "Singing Cotton-Picking Girls" soloed by Peibutov, which respectively express the unique styles of the songs of the Uzbek and Azerbaijani nationalities. The various performances of Soviet artists are truly art belonging to the great new era of mankind. Everyone will be attracted by the rich content of life, beautiful melodies, and vivid artistic images they express.
    Soviet artists are constantly seeking and developing realistic artistic forms. Taking dance as an example, the classical dance in the ballet "Swan Lake" performed by the outstanding Soviet ballet dancer Ulanova uses many detailed movements to express the character of the characters to enrich the image of the characters, so that her performance reaches a perfect state of noble artistic style, beautiful movements, and full emotions. This is an outstanding performance that unifies human natural movements with music and dance. She not only overthrew the vulgar traditions of decadent bourgeois dance, but also broke through the conventions of the postures and steps of classical dance, so that the beautiful elements of classical dance and the new Soviet life are integrated into a pure and vivid realistic content and form.
    The creative spirit shown by Soviet artists is inseparable from their love for national artistic traditions. In many talks, they told us that every new development in art must utilize the heritage accumulated by the art development of previous generations, and make appropriate modifications to adapt it to new historical conditions and the needs of the people; only on this basis can there be new artistic creations. This truth has been best proven in the experience of great Soviet artists.
    All the Soviet artists who are with us today dedicate their entire body and mind to the art work they are engaged in. They believe that art is the best tool for them to serve the people. The artistic achievements of each of them are inseparable from their rich life practice and profound artistic accomplishment. Their art is permeated with the lofty ideas of socialism and communism. They consciously make their art closely serve the actual interests of the people at all times. Their work is naturally increasingly respected by the people. These many Soviet artists, whether during the Soviet Patriotic War or during peaceful construction, have done a lot of creative work in the front or the rear.
    A high level of political and theoretical accomplishment is a common strength of Soviet artists. Outstanding Soviet film actor Ladynina emphasized in a symposium that film actors should study politics. She said that Soviet film actors should study Marxism-Leninism and participate in various social activities. This is undoubtedly extremely important for all our art workers. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union has made many resolutions to strengthen the political and ideological leadership of art work. Our party leader Comrade Mao Zedong also pointed out in "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art": "It is right for literary and art workers to study literary and art creation; however, Marxism-Leninism is a science that all revolutionaries should study, and literary and art workers are no exception. In addition, they must also study society, that is, to study the various classes in society, their interrelationships and individual conditions, their faces and their psychology. Only when these are clarified can our literature and art have rich content and correct direction." All our art workers should firmly remember Comrade Mao Zedong's words and take the Soviet artists who have come to our country as an example and strive to study Marxism-Leninism to improve our political and theoretical level. We sincerely thank the Soviet artists for the enlightenment and help they have given us in the activities of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Month. This should be regarded as an event of great significance in the lives of our people. All our art workers should earnestly learn from the Soviet artists.

### 向苏联艺术家学习

    向苏联艺术家学习
    以吉洪诺夫为首的苏联文化工作者代表团、由楚拉基领导的苏联艺术工作团、以鲍·亚·亚历山大罗夫为首的苏军红旗歌舞团和以费道罗夫为首的苏联电影艺术工作者代表团，带着伟大的斯大林同志和苏联人民对我国人民的关怀，来到我国参加中苏友好月，使我国人民感到无上的兴奋和光荣。
    我国人民在最近三年来得到苏联所给予的伟大友谊的援助是无可计量的。成千的苏联专家为我国的建设事业已经做了并继续做着巨大的贡献，现在苏联杰出的艺术家们又给我们带来了卓越的苏维埃的艺术，使我国人民能够更真切地接触到人类最先进的艺术，并使我国的艺术工作者能够更直接地向他们学习。我们应该表示衷心的感谢。
    近一周间，苏联友人在北京，与我们的领袖和群众会面了。他们与我们的干部、工人、农民、学生、妇女普遍地举行了讲演、座谈和访问，特别是苏联杰出的艺术家们连续的表演，给了我们以莫大的教益。我们由此更清楚地认识了在一切方面都必须把苏联作为我们学习的最好榜样。向苏联艺术家学习，在眼前更是不可多得的机会。
    这次来到我国的几个团体的艺术家们，许多都是有杰出成就的、享受高度荣誉的苏维埃艺术的代表人物。从他们的表演和谈话中，我们处处可以学习到极可贵的经验。无论是苏联影片，或是他们所表演的苏军歌舞、巴蕾舞、歌唱、音乐等，没有一样不是充满着高度的思想性和艺术性的。他们受到我国观众这么热烈的欢迎，完全不是偶然的。
    看了苏联艺术家的各种表演，人们都会发现其中有一个共同的东西。这就是它们洋溢着真正属于人民的生活的朝气，鼓舞着人们前进的思想。如红旗歌舞团所表演的战士的歌唱和舞蹈，都具有特殊的风格。它以愉快活泼、充满着朝气和勇敢精神为特色。苏联艺术家的许多表演，在内容方面是社会主义的，而在形式方面则具有在苏联多民族国家中的各个民族的特点。如苏联杰出的歌唱家米哈依洛夫独唱的“伏尔加船夫曲”，充分表现了伟大的俄罗斯民族劳动人民的雄浑坚定的性格。又如纳赛罗娃独唱的“乌兹别克女郎的和平之歌”和裴布托夫独唱的“歌唱采棉的姑娘”，就各自表现了乌兹别克和阿塞拜疆两个民族歌曲的独特风格。苏联艺术家们的各种表演，都是真正属于人类伟大的新时代的艺术。每一个人都会被它们所表现的丰富的生活内容、优美的旋律和生动的艺术形象所吸引。
    苏联的艺术家们对于现实主义的艺术形式，是不断地在寻求着并不断地加以发展的。以舞蹈来说，苏联杰出的巴蕾舞舞蹈家乌兰诺娃所表演的舞剧
    “天鹅湖”中的古典舞，用了许多表现人物性格的细致动作来丰富人物的形象，使她的表演达到了艺术上风格高尚、动作优美和情绪丰满的完好的地步。这是把人的自然动作和音乐与舞蹈统一起来的杰出的表演。她不但推翻了腐朽的资产阶级舞蹈的庸俗传统，并且突破了古典舞的姿态和步法的成规，使古典舞的优美成分和新的苏维埃的生活，融合在纯朴而生动的现实主义的内容与形式中。
    苏联的艺术家们所表现的创造精神，和他们对于民族的艺术传统的热爱是不可分的。他们在许多谈话中告诉我们：艺术上的每一个新的发展，必须利用前代艺术发展所积累的遗产，加以适当的改造，使它适应于新的历史条件和人民的需要；在这个基础上才能有新的艺术创造。这个真理在伟大的苏联艺术家们的经验中，已经得到最好的证明了。
    今天跟我们在一起的所有苏联的艺术家们，都把他们的全部身心交付给他们所从事的艺术工作，他们认定艺术是他们为人民服务的最好工具。他们每一个人在艺术上的成就，都和他们丰富的生活实践与深刻的艺术修养分不开。他们的艺术浸透了社会主义和共产主义的崇高的思想，他们时时刻刻有意识地使他们的艺术紧紧服务于人民的实际利益，他们的工作也就自然日益受着人民的尊敬。这许多苏联艺术家，无论是在苏联卫国战争期间，或是在和平建设期间，他们都在前线或后方做了很多富有创造性的工作。
    高度的政治理论修养是苏联艺术家们的共同的长处。杰出的苏联电影演员拉迪尼娜，在座谈会上强调电影演员要学习政治。她说苏联的电影演员都要学习马克思列宁主义，参加各种社会活动。这无疑地对于我们所有的艺术工作者都是极重要的。苏联共产党中央为加强艺术工作的政治思想领导，曾做出了许多决议。我们党的领袖毛泽东同志在“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”中，也指出：“文艺工作者应该学习文艺创作，这是对的；但是马克思列宁主义是一切革命者都应该学习的科学，文艺工作者不能是例外。此外还要学习社会，就是要研究社会上的各个阶级，它们的相互关系和个别状况，它们的面貌和它们的心理。只有把这些弄清楚了，我们的文艺才能有丰富的内容和正确的方向。”我们所有的艺术工作者都应该牢牢记住毛泽东同志的话，并以现在来到我国的苏联艺术家们为榜样，努力学习马克思列宁主义来提高我们的政治理论水平。我们热诚地感谢苏联艺术家们在中苏友好月的活动中给予我们的启示与帮助。这应该被看做是我国人民生活中具有重大意义的事件。我国所有的艺术工作者都应该认真地向苏联的艺术家们学习。
