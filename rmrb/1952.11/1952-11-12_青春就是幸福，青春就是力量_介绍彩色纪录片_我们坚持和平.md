Youth is happiness, youth is strength; this is the profound impression the documentary "We Persist in Peace" leaves on the audience. Young people create a happy life with inexhaustible strength, and when this happy life is threatened by aggressive war, they will inevitably use inexhaustible strength to defend it.

In the film, we first see that the happy creation of youth is inseparable from peace, democracy, and labor. Only in a land of peace and democracy, in the creation of great collective labor, can the flower of youthful happiness bloom brilliantly. Look at how enthusiastically and intelligently, how diligently, young men and women in socialist Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries are creating their own new lives! They are building dikes in Czechoslovakia, building the unprecedentedly huge hydroelectric power station on both sides of the Volga River in the Soviet Union, building new cities in Poland, Albania, and Bulgaria, and building the Danube-Black Sea Canal in Romania. They build high-rise buildings on the ruins of the war, and they turn deserts into fertile fields. Next to the turning machines, on the galloping tractors, we see the happy smiles of youth. In the Soviet capital, young men and women are studying attentively, preparing to participate in peaceful labor. On the sunny Soviet coast, young people and children are exercising their bodies and swimming happily in the blue sea. On the wide, smooth asphalt roads, groups of children stride briskly to their schools...

However, in the dark corners of the world, the ghosts of imperialism and fascism are still active. In the film, we see how American imperialists ignited the flames of aggression in Korea, burning peaceful and happy cities and villages, and destroying tens of thousands of lives. Acheson said that Korea is a factory, and the United States wants to create such a world model here. MacArthur said that he felt very happy when he saw the ruins of Korean cities. Ridgway said that soldiers should kill people, and that is why I came to Korea. The true faces of these beasts in human clothing are vividly revealed in the midst of swords and shadows. Not only that, but American imperialists have also collected a large number of Nazi garbage in Europe, using this garbage to cultivate the germs of fascism. On the training grounds of West Germany, the heads of the Atlantic aggressive bloc are training aggressive pawns on a large scale. Nazi bandits drive American heavy tanks and rampage across the fields of West Germany; they fly American planes and show off their power in the skies of West Germany. The embers of fascism have been rekindled, and the whole world feels the threat of aggressive war. It is in such a situation that the flame of youth defending peace is burning!

In early August 1951, the Third World Youth and Student Peace Festival was held in the capital of the German Democratic Republic. This was an unprecedentedly grand gathering and an unprecedentedly powerful demonstration! 25,000 representatives from 104 countries and 2 million young people from all parts of Germany came to participate. Representatives from many countries broke through the obstruction of reactionary governments and poured into Berlin from all directions by sea, land, and air, just like countless tributaries converging into the sea, surging and roaring, with overwhelming momentum. They belong to different races, different nationalities, and different social classes, and their religious beliefs and political beliefs are also different, but they have a common desire and a common slogan: Stop aggressive war and defend peace!

Defend peace! This is the common demand of people all over the world.

Defend peace! This is the common program of action for young people all over the world.

The fiery flames of youth defending peace are burning in Berlin's railway stations, Berlin's airports, Berlin's squares, and Berlin's streets! East Berlin is boiling! An unstoppable desire for peace, an unstoppable yearning for a bright future, and the invincible power of youth have formed a giant river of steel here.

Here is the Soviet youth delegation under the banner of Stalin, the banner and guide of progressive youth all over the world! Each of them is a flower of youth, an embodiment of happiness and strength. Here is the youth delegation of the People's Republic of China under the banner of Mao Zedong, a model for the liberation of all oppressed national youths! Here are the youth delegations of the people's democratic countries, who, together with the people of their respective countries, have cleared the rubble on the ruins and are gradually building a paradise of free and happy new life! Here is the youth delegation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea under the banner of Kim Il-sung, the vanguard of anti-aggression youth all over the world!

"Korea, we support you! Korea will surely win!" This is the earth-shattering voice shouted in the languages of all countries by two million young warriors! Here are the youth representatives from colonial countries, and here are the youth representatives from capitalist countries. They reported the profound suffering of their respective countries and people and expressed their determination and unwavering belief in striving for democracy and defending peace. They cheered the Soviet delegation and the delegations of the people's democratic countries, cheered the delegation of New China, and cheered the delegation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea! They saw the path of struggle towards happiness from these delegations!

In solemn parades and demonstrations, in intimate visits and get-togethers, the youth delegations from 104 countries mingled together. The Soviet delegation hosted the American youth representatives. American representatives paid tribute to the heroic Korean people and the Chinese people. The French delegation welcomed the Vietnamese delegation with flowers. The Dutch representative gave the Indonesian representative a flag symbolizing peace and friendship. A British female representative painfully said to the Korean representative: "My brother died on the Korean battlefield." The Korean youth said: "Our female youth are also very painful, they have cried all their tears dry." This is the most painful accusation by the British and Korean youth representatives against their common enemy - the aggressive bloc headed by American imperialism! Yes, the happy youth of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has been trampled upon! But what will young women who have lived in peace, democracy, and happiness do when they have cried all their tears dry under the trampling of the invaders? Isn't the fact that the "strongest" imperialism has been battered and bruised in "tiny" Korea the most realistic answer?

Stalin instructed us: "If the people of all countries take on the cause of maintaining peace and persevere in this cause to the end, peace can be maintained and consolidated. If the warmongers succeed in trapping the masses of the people in a web of lies, deceiving the masses of the people, and dragging the masses of the people into another world war, then war may become inevitable." The film "We Persist in Peace" uses authentic historical records and the overwhelming power of youth to prove that the people of all countries can undertake the cause of maintaining peace, and the shameful conspiracy of the warmongers to trap the masses of the people in a web of lies will never succeed!

    青春就是幸福，青春就是力量
    ——介绍彩色纪录片“我们坚持和平”
    陈梓
    编剧：培利耶夫、弗劳洛夫艺术指导兼总导演：培利耶夫、德发电影制片厂总导演：里斯·伊文斯翻译：尹广文、王澍荣膺列宁勋章之莫斯科电影制片厂与德意志民主共和国德发电影制片厂出品中央电影局东北电影制片厂译制
    青春就是幸福，青春就是力量，这是纪录片“我们坚持和平”给予观众的深刻印象。青年们以无穷无尽的力量创造着幸福的生活，而当这种幸福生活受到侵略战争的威胁时，他们又必然要用无穷无尽的力量来保卫它。
    在影片上，我们首先看到青春的幸福的创造，是跟和平、民主和劳动分不开的。只有在和平、民主的国土上，在伟大的集体劳动的创造中，青春才能开放绚烂的幸福之花。你看，在社会主义的苏联和各人民民主国家，男女青年们是以怎样的热情和智慧、怎样紧张的劳动，在创造着各自的新生活！他们建设着捷克斯洛伐克的河堤，建设着苏联伏尔加河两岸的空前巨大的水力发电站，建设着波兰、阿尔巴尼亚、保加利亚的新城市，兴修着罗马尼亚的多瑙河——黑海运河。他们在战后的废墟上建造起高楼大厦，他们把沙漠变成良田。在转动的机器旁边，在奔驰的拖拉机上，我们看到青春的幸福的笑容。在苏联的首都，男女青年们在专心地学习，准备参加和平的劳动。在阳光普照的苏联的海滨，青年和儿童们在锻炼着身体，在蓝色的海水里快活地游泳。在宽大、光滑的柏油马路上，成群结队的孩子们轻快地走向自己的学校。……
    然而，在世界的黑暗的角落里，帝国主义和法西斯主义的游魂依然活动着。在影片里，我们看到美帝国主义者怎样在朝鲜燃起侵略的火焰，烧毁着和平幸福的城市和乡村，毁灭了成千成万的生命。艾奇逊说，朝鲜是一个工厂，美国要在这里制造一个这样的世界模型。麦克阿瑟说，他看到朝鲜城市的废墟，心里非常痛快。李奇微说，士兵应该杀人，我来到朝鲜就是为了这个目的。这些人面兽心的衣冠禽兽们的原形，便在刀光剑影中活现出来了。不仅如此，美帝国主义者又在欧洲收集了大批纳粹垃圾，利用这些垃圾培养着法西斯的毒菌。在西德的练兵场上，大西洋侵略集团的首脑们正在大规模地训练着侵略的爪牙。纳粹匪徒们驾驶着美国的重坦克，在西德的原野上横冲直撞；他们驾驶着美国的飞机在西德的天空耀武扬威。法西斯主义的死灰复燃了，全世界都感觉到侵略战争的威胁。就在这样的情况下，保卫和平的青春之火燃烧起来了！
    一九五一年八月初旬，在民主德国的首都举行了第三届世界青年与学生和平联欢节。这是空前盛大的联欢，也是空前强大的示威！一百零四个国家的两万五千名代表及来自德国各地的二百万青年都来参加。许多国家的代表突破了反动政府的阻挠，从海路、陆路和空中，从四方八面涌到了柏林，正如无数旁支细流汇成了大海，奔腾澎湃，气吞山岳。他们属于不同种族、不同民族和不同社会阶层，他们的宗教信仰和政治信仰也不相同，然而他们有一个共同的愿望，一个共同的口号：制止侵略战争，保卫和平！
    保卫和平！这就是全世界人民共同的要求。
    保卫和平！这就是全世界青年共同的行动纲领。
    保卫和平的青春的烈火燃烧在柏林的火车站上、柏林的飞机场上、柏林的广场上、柏林的街头！东柏林沸腾了！不可遏止的对和平的渴望，不可阻挠的对美好的未来的向往，不可战胜的青春的力量，在这里形成一条钢铁的巨流。
    这里是在斯大林旗帜下的苏联青年代表团，全世界进步青年的旗帜和向导！他们中的每一个人都是青春的花朵，是幸福和力量的化身。这里是在毛泽东旗帜下的中华人民共和国青年代表团，一切被压迫民族青年的翻身榜样！这里是各人民民主国家的青年代表团，他们跟各自祖国的人民一起，扫清了废墟上的瓦砾，逐步建设着自由幸福的新生活的乐园！这里是在金日成旗帜下的朝鲜民主主义人民共和国青年代表团，全世界反侵略青年的先锋队！
    “朝鲜，我们支持你！朝鲜一定胜利！”这就是二百万青年战士们用世界各国语言呼喊出来的惊天动地的声音！这里是各殖民地国家的青年代表们，这里是各资本主义国家的青年代表们。他们报告了各自国家和人民的深重苦难，表示了争取民主、保卫和平的决心和必胜的信念。他们向苏联代表团和各人民民主国家代表团欢呼，向新中国代表团欢呼，向朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代表团欢呼！他们从这些代表团看到了自己走向幸福的战斗道路！
    在庄严的游行示威中，在亲密的访问和联欢中，
    一百零四个国家的青年代表团打成了一片。苏联代表团招待美国青年代表。美国代表向英勇的朝鲜人民和中国人民致敬。法国代表团拿鲜花欢迎越南代表团。荷兰代表送给印度尼西亚代表一面象征和平友谊的旗子。英国女代表痛苦地对朝鲜代表说：“我的哥哥死在朝鲜战场上了。”朝鲜青年说：“我国的女青年也很痛苦，她们把眼泪都哭干了。”这是英国和朝鲜青年代表对他们的共同敌人——以美帝国主义为首的侵略集团——的最沉痛的控诉！是的，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的幸福的青春被蹂躏了！然而在和平、民主、幸福中生活过来的女青年们，在侵略者的蹂躏下哭干了眼泪的时候，会做些什么呢？“最强的”帝国主义在“小小的”朝鲜碰得头破血流的事实，不是最现实的答案吗？
    斯大林指示我们：“如果各国人民将维护和平的事业担当起来，并且把这一事业坚持到底，和平就能够保持和巩固。如果战争贩子用谎言的罗网陷害人民群众能够得逞，欺骗了人民群众，将人民群众拖入另一次世界大战之中，那末战争就可能变得不可避免。”影片“我们坚持和平”用真实的历史纪录、用排山倒海的青春的力量，证明了各国人民能够担当维护和平的事业，战争贩子用谎言的罗网陷害人民群众的可耻阴谋，决不能得逞！（附图片）
