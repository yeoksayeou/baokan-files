The "Exhibition of Latin American Artists' Works for Representatives of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference," jointly sponsored by the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and the All-China Federation of Fine Arts Workers, held a preview on the 10th at the Cultural Club here.

Present at the preview were Guo Moruo, Chairman of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, Jiang Feng and Ye Qianyu, Vice Chairmen of the All-China Federation of Fine Arts Workers, members of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace in Beijing, and people from cultural and artistic circles in the capital, totaling more than 70 people.

Also attending the preview were some representatives from Chile, Colombia, Indonesia, and Mexico, who attended the Peace Conference and are still staying in Beijing.

Staff members of various countries' embassies in China also attended the preview.

Guo Moruo presided over the preview. In his speech, he pointed out that this exhibition is a concrete step in implementing the "Resolution on Cultural Exchange" of the Peace Conference. Through these artworks, we can better understand the lives of the Latin American people. He hoped that more exhibitions of this kind would be held in the future, on a larger scale.

The exhibition displays a total of 165 works, including works by Chilean representative to the Peace Conference, Miria Lafente; Colombian representative, Alipio Jaramillo; Mexican representative, Javier Guerrero; and works by Mexican artists from the Puebla Painters Association brought by Mexican representative Luis Rivera Terrasas and works by artists from the woodcut groups in Porto Alegre, Brazil, brought by the Brazilian special envoy, Ape Chemonte, presented to the All-China Federation of Fine Arts Workers. The exhibition also displayed many colorful clay figures and handicrafts created by Mexican folk artists. Most of these works reflect the suffering of the Latin American people under the plunder and oppression of the imperialists, the heroic and unyielding hearts with which they persevere in their struggles despite police persecution, and their longing for peace and their vision of happiness. Another part of the works reveals the living conditions of the Latin American people.
