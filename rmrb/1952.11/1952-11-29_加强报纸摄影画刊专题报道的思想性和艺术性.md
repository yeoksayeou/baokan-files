    Strengthening the Ideological and Artistic Nature of Photographic Pictorial Special Reports in Newspapers
    In the past six months, the photographic pictorials of many newspapers have adopted the editorial method of special reports, demonstrating the uniqueness and local color of the pictorials in various regions.
    However, many newspapers' pictorials still fail to fully utilize the form of special reports to reflect the diverse and fresh things in various regions. Some newspapers' pictorials use pictures to continuously report on certain specialized technical details, which not only makes the pictorial appear rigid in form due to the continuous technical process, but also makes the content dry and tasteless. For example, the "Learning from the 'May Fourth' Coal Mining Team Leader's Wall-Type Double Circulation Operation Experience to Improve Coal Mine Mining Efficiency" pictorial published in the Dazhong Daily on August 18 is one example. This pictorial continuously reported on a series of technical processes and details in coal mining operations, such as operating machinery, paying attention to safety, checking the roof, and organizing labor. However, these technical details, when expressed in the pictures, are nothing more than some different scenes and a few poses from different angles. It fails to even introduce some basic knowledge about coal mines to the public, let alone attract and play a role in educating and inspiring people. The Shanghai News Daily's "Introducing the Soviet Advanced Medical Experience 'Painless Childbirth Method'" pictorial on September 7 also has the same shortcomings. This pictorial focused on introducing the delivery process using the "painless childbirth method," attempting to use pictures to illustrate some characteristics and important steps of "painless childbirth." However, many extremely awkward and unacceptable images appeared in the pictures. The above two examples illustrate that it is not only difficult to report on technology using pictures in terms of expression, but also because the target audience of newspapers is not just technical personnel, but the general public. There is no need to make specific, detailed technical reports on certain advanced experiences or work methods. The pictorial cannot completely express these technical processes clearly. Therefore, even if technical personnel read such a pictorial, they cannot follow the steps shown in each picture.
    The special reports in pictorials must express ideas, not just pure technology. Because technical issues are often not directly related to the lives and thoughts of the general public, they cannot be easily accepted by the masses or demonstrate their persuasiveness. If our photographic pictorials can fully express the various aspects of the lives of heroes who create great wealth for the country, express the fresh things in our motherland and the diverse impacts it directly gives to the broad masses of people, and use these concrete things to embody the valuable and excellent qualities of some heroic models, and to embody the rapid changes in the lives and social outlook of the broad masses of people, thereby showcasing the unlimited future and infinitely beautiful prospects of our motherland, then the broad masses of people can be inspired and educated.
    We might as well cite a relatively successful example of a special report in a photographic pictorial. The Liberation Daily's pictorial on September 13, "Urban and Rural Material Exchange Becomes More Active," demonstrated the role of urban and rural material exchange through temple fairs. It not only explained what problems were solved by the urban and rural material exchange, but more importantly, it showed the significant changes in the lives of farmers in all aspects through this material exchange meeting. Each photograph in this pictorial expressed the true image of life, giving people a greater appeal.
    From here, we can see that going deep into life and being familiar with things is very important. This method of expression, which delves into life, is fresher, more vivid, more persuasive, and more closely related to the essence of things than simply showing machines and workers when expressing workers, or only showing farmers holding a bundle of grain when expressing farmers. Only in this way can each photograph in the pictorial not only express the theme, but also embody all aspects surrounding the theme, giving the reader a complete, systematic and profound impression.
    Therefore, the editors and photographers of various newspaper pictorials must deeply experience life, reflect the fresh things in various regions from real life, and improve and strengthen the ideological and artistic nature of special reports in newspaper photographic pictorials.

### 加强报纸摄影画刊专题报道的思想性和艺术性

    加强报纸摄影画刊专题报道的思想性和艺术性
    最近半年来，各地许多报纸的摄影画刊都采取了专题报道的编辑方法，表现了各地报纸画刊的独特性和地方性的色彩。
    但是有不少报纸的画刊还不能充分地运用专题报道的形式，来反映各地区多种多样的新鲜事物。有些报纸的画刊却用图片来连续报道某些专门性的技术细节，这样不仅使得画刊在形式上不得不因技术的连续过程而显得刻板，而且在内容上也就苦涩无味。例如大众日报八月十八日所刊登的“学习‘五四’采煤队长壁式双循环作业经验，提高煤矿采煤效率”画刊，就是一个例子。这期画刊连续地报道了采煤作业中的操纵机械、注意保安、检查顶板和劳动组织等一连串的技术过程和细节，而这些技术细节表现在画面上不过是一些不同场面和几个不同角度的姿势，连给人们介绍一些有关煤矿知识的目的都不能达到，那么就更不可能吸引人们和起着教育、鼓舞人们的作用了。上海新闻日报九月七日的“介绍苏联先进医学经验‘无痛分娩法’”画刊，也存在着同样的缺点。这期画刊着重地介绍了采用“无痛分娩法”的分娩过程，企图用图片来说明“无痛分娩法”分娩的一些特点和几个重要步骤，但是在图片的画面上却出现了许多极其勉强和令人难以接受的形象。以上这两个例子都说明了不仅用图片来报道技术，在表现方法上有困难，而且因为报纸的对象并不都是一些技术人员，而是广大的人民群众，没有必要对某些先进经验或工作方法作具体的、细节的技术上的报道，画刊也不可能把这些技术过程完全表现清楚。因此即使技术人员看了这样的画刊，也不能按照画刊中逐图所表现的那样按步去做。
    画刊的专题报道必须表现思想，而不应当表现单纯的技术，因为技术问题往往和广大群众的生活、思想没有直接的联系，因此就不可能也不易被群众所接受和显示它的说服力。如果我们的摄影画刊能够充分表现为国家创造巨大财富的英雄们的各个方面的生活，表现我们祖国的新鲜事物和它直接给予广大人民的多方面的影响，以这些具体的事物来体现一些英雄模范的可贵的优良品质，体现广大人民的生活和社会面貌的迅速变化，从而展示我们祖国不可限量的前途和无限美好的远景，那么广大的群众就可以从这里得到鼓舞和教育。
    我们不妨举一个摄影画刊专题报道比较成功的例子。解放日报九月十三日“城乡物资交流更活泼起来了”的画刊，表现了通过庙会形式进行城乡物资交流的作用，它不只是说明了城乡物资交流解决了一些什么问题，最重要的还在于表现出通过这次物资交流会而显现了的农民在生活各个方面的显著变化。这期画刊的每幅照片都表现了生活的真实形象，给人以较大的感染力。
    从这里我们可以看出深入生活和熟悉事物是非常重要的。这种深入生活的表现方法，要比那些在表现工人时单单表现机器和工人，表现农民时只表现农民抱着一捆谷子要来得更新鲜生动，更富有说服力和接触到事物的本质；也唯有这样才能使画刊的每幅照片不仅表现了主题，而且同时体现了围绕主题的各个方面，给读者一个完整、系统而深刻的印象。
    因此，各个报纸画刊的编辑和摄影记者必须深入体验生活，从实际生活中来反映各地区的新鲜事物，提高和加强报纸摄影画刊专题报道的思想性和艺术性。
