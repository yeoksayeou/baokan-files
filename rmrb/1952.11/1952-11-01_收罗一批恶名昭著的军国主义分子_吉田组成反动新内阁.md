Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, October 31st: The Liberal Party, which won a majority in the election by deceiving voters and bribing under the multifaceted assistance of US Ambassador Murphy, formed a reactionary cabinet on the 29th headed by Yoshida Shigeru, which actively implements the US policy of reviving Japanese militarism.

Yoshida's new cabinet has a total of sixteen members, almost half of whom are notorious militarists who have been purged, including Mukaichu Haru (Minister of Finance), the agent of the Mitsui Zaibatsu who was purged; Ogata Taketora (Minister of State) and Chief Cabinet Secretary, the former Director of the Information Bureau of the Koiso Cabinet, who recently traveled to Southeast Asia and Taiwan on Yoshida's orders to carry out conspiracies; and Inukai Ken (Minister of Justice), who served as an economic advisor to the Wang Jingwei puppet government.

Seven members of the previous cabinet continue to hold their posts. Okazaki Katsuo, who was reviled by the Japanese people for signing the humiliating US-Japan "Administrative Agreement" and became infamous for bribery in the general election, continues to serve as Minister of Foreign Affairs; the former Minister of Finance Ikeda Hayato, who faithfully implemented the "Dodge Plan," the US policy of enslaving Japan, was transferred to Minister of International Trade and Industry; Kimura Tokutaro, who drafted the fascist "Subversive Activities Prevention Law" while serving as Director-General of the Legal Affairs Agency (later Minister of Justice) in the previous Yoshida Cabinet, was transferred to Minister of State and Director-General of the de facto military "Security Agency." The retention of these figures is clearly inseparable from their faithful implementation of the US policy of enslaving Japan and reviving militarist forces.

In order to win over the reactionary opposition parties in the House of Councillors, Yoshida appointed Takase Shotaro, chairman of the Policy Affairs Research Council of Ryokufukai, as Minister of Postal Services, and appointed Hayashiya Kamejiro of the so-called Democratic Club as Minister of State.

The overt opposition and contradictions between the Yoshida group and the Hatoyama group within the Liberal Party, which were exposed in the general election, were not eliminated in this cabinet formation. After the general election, the Yoshida group and the Hatoyama group staged an ugly drama of scrambling for the position of prime minister, and finally reluctantly decided to continue to let Yoshida Shigeru serve as prime minister. In the process of forming the cabinet, Yoshida only appointed Ishii Mitsujiro, a member of the Hatoyama group who had been purged, as Minister of Transport.

Yoshida's new cabinet has been met with widespread opposition in Japan. According to a United Press report from Tokyo on the 29th, all opposition parties "unanimously criticized the new Japanese cabinet as 'reactionary' and serving 'exclusively for American interests.'" The left-wing Socialist Party said that the Yoshida cabinet "is becoming increasingly reactionary." The General Council of Trade Unions of Japan also criticized the reactionary nature of the new cabinet.

According to Reuters, Japanese newspapers generally believe that Yoshida's new cabinet is unstable. The "Asahi Shimbun" said: "It is generally believed that this cabinet will not last long. The ruling Liberal Party only has a slight majority in the Diet, and it is widely believed that the party is still in chaos due to the party strife between two hostile leaders."

### 收罗一批恶名昭著的军国主义分子  吉田组成反动新内阁

    收罗一批恶名昭著的军国主义分子
    吉田组成反动新内阁
    【新华社三十一日讯】东京消息：在美国大使墨菲的多方扶助下靠骗取选票和贿赂而在大选中获得多数的自由党，于二十九日组成了以吉田茂为首的积极执行美国复活日本军国主义政策的反动内阁。
    吉田的新内阁共有十六个阁员，其中几乎有半数是曾被整肃的罪行昭彰的军国主义分子，其中包括曾被整肃的三井财阀的代理人向井忠晴（藏相）小矶内阁的情报局总裁、最近曾奉吉田之命到东南亚和台湾进行阴谋活动的绪方竹虎（国务相）兼内阁书记长官，曾任汪逆精卫伪政府经济顾问的犬养健（法务相）。
    前届内阁阁员有七人继续留任。以签订丧权辱国的美日“行政协定”而遭到日本人民唾骂并因在大选中进行贿赂而臭名远扬的冈崎胜男，继任外务相；忠实执行美国奴役日本的经济政策“道奇方案”的前任藏相池田勇人，改任通商产业相；在上届吉田内阁中担任法务府总裁（后任法务相）时起草法西斯的“防止破坏活动法”的木村笃太郎，改任国务相兼变相军部“保安厅”长官。这些人物的留任，显然是与他们忠实执行美国奴役日本和复活军国主义势力政策的罪恶分不开的。
    为了拉拢参议院的反动在野党派，吉田任命绿风会的政务调查会会长高濑庄太郎为邮政相，并任命所谓民主俱乐部的林屋龟次郎为国务相。
    自由党内部吉田集团与鸠山集团在大选中露骨化了的对立和矛盾，在此次组阁中并未能消除。大选结束后，为了推选首相人选，吉田集团和鸠山集团曾经发生你抢我夺的丑剧，最后才勉强决定继续由吉田茂出任首相。吉田在组阁过程中，仅任命了一个曾被整肃的鸠山集团的人物石井光次郎为运输相。
    吉田的新内阁在日本遭到了普遍的反对。据合众社东京二十九日讯，各反对党“一致抨击日本新内阁是‘反动的’，是‘专门为美国利益’服务的”。左派社会党说：吉田内阁“变本加厉地走向反动”。日本工会总评议会也指责新内阁的反动本质。
    据路透社讯，日本的报纸普遍地认为吉田的新内阁是不稳固的。“朝日新闻”说：“一般相信这个内阁是不会长久的。执政的自由党只在国会中占微少的多数，而且众信该党内部仍因两个敌对领袖间的党争而处于混乱状态。”
