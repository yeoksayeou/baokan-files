    Huangyan Honey Tangerines in Zhejiang Achieve a Bumper Harvest
    The nationally renowned Huangyan honey tangerines in Zhejiang Province have achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest. It is estimated that the county will produce more than 50 million jin this year, an increase of more than 45% over the highest pre-war annual output. In the now lush tangerine orchards of over 23,000 mu on both sides of the Chengjiang River in the county, thousands upon thousands of farmers are joyfully picking tangerines. In order to guide farmers to improve tangerine cultivation techniques and increase yields, the People's Government invited several Soviet fruit experts to Huangyan this autumn to investigate and introduce Soviet advanced experiences in scientific pruning, rational fertilization, and eradication of pests and diseases in fruit tree cultivation. Now, according to the experience introduced by Soviet experts, the vast number of farmers are combining fruit picking with pruning and rational fertilization, preparing to welcome an even greater harvest next year.

    浙江黄岩蜜橘丰收
    驰名全国的浙江省黄岩蜜橘空前大丰收；预计全县今年可产五千多万斤，较战前最高年产量增加百分之四十五以上。现该县澄江两岸两万三千多亩密茂的橘园里，成千上万的农民正满怀着喜悦采摘橘子。为指导农民提高栽培橘树技术、增加产量，人民政府今秋曾先后邀请了好几位苏联水果专家到黄岩考察和介绍苏联种植水果的科学修剪、合理施肥、根治虫病害等先进经验。现广大农民正根据苏联专家介绍的经验，在采摘橘果时，结合整枝修剪和合理施肥工作，准备迎接明年更大的丰收。
