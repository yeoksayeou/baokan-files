According to the agreement between China and the Soviet Union on establishing the Sino-Soviet Civil Aviation Joint Stock Company, the Sino-Soviet Civil Aviation Joint Stock Company was established in July 1950. With the joint efforts of Chinese and Soviet comrades, especially with the direct participation of Soviet comrades headed by Comrade Shedrelevich, the work of this company has achieved great success, playing a significant role in the development of China's economy and culture, strengthening Sino-Soviet economic and cultural cooperation, and setting a good example for the development of New China's civil aviation industry.

In the past two years, the Sino-Soviet Civil Aviation Joint Stock Company has resolutely implemented the economic accounting system, successfully implemented the policy of cultivating Chinese cadres from work, earnestly adopted the advanced experience of Soviet civil aviation, and absolutely guaranteed the safety of flights that could not be guaranteed in old China. As a result, its business has developed rapidly. Now, the Sino-Soviet Civil Aviation Joint Stock Company has the scale of an advanced people's aviation enterprise. It has opened three routes with Beijing as the center: east through Shenyang and Harbin to Chita in the Soviet Union; north through Zhangjiakou, and through Ulaanbaatar, the capital of the Mongolian People's Republic, to Irkutsk in the Soviet Union; and west through Xi'an, Lanzhou, and Dihua (Ürümqi) and other cities to Almaty in the Soviet Union. It has also established management offices for these three routes and set up nineteen airport stations.

The Sino-Soviet Civil Aviation Joint Stock Company completed a 23 percent higher transport rate in 1951 than originally planned, and this year's planned transport rate is 21 percent higher than last year. It has also reduced fares twice. The financial revenue and expenditure have met the requirements of the state. The rapid growth of the Sino-Soviet Civil Aviation Joint Stock Company reflects the development and consolidation of the friendly cooperation between the Chinese and Soviet peoples.

With the increasing development of China's economic and cultural construction, and with the increasingly close economic and cultural exchanges between the countries of the world peace and democracy camp, the business of the Sino-Soviet Civil Aviation Joint Stock Company is expanding every day. In the past two years, the quantity of various material samples exported from China and the quantity of machinery and precision instruments imported that are necessary for the development of China's industry have increased daily through the Sino-Soviet Civil Aviation Joint Stock Company's air transport. The exhibits of the Chinese industrial exhibitions held in the Mongolian People's Republic, the German Democratic Republic, and Bulgaria were mainly transported by the Sino-Soviet Civil Aviation Joint Stock Company. In July 1952, in order to actively develop the rich forests of the motherland, the Northeast Forestry Department signed a contract with the Sino-Soviet Civil Aviation Joint Stock Company, stipulating that before the Heilongjiang River in northern China froze in 1952, aerial surveys of the Xing'an Mountains forest area would be conducted, and equipment and supplies would be provided to the land survey brigade. Under the personal leadership of Soviet experts, especially Director of Flight Guleyev, the Sino-Soviet Civil Aviation Joint Stock Company overcame difficulties such as imperfect airports and incomplete equipment, and completed this task on schedule, enabling the smooth development of the work of developing forests and constructing forest areas in the Xing'an Mountains area in the Northeast this year. In August 1951, floods occurred in the Liao River in Northeast China, submerging the Beining Railway and causing trains to stop. The Sino-Soviet Civil Aviation Joint Stock Company immediately increased the number of flights on the Beijing-Chita route to maintain this important transportation line, and cooperated with the Northeast People's Government to carry out special flight missions to airdrop food and lifebuoys to the disaster areas, playing a significant role in rapidly reducing the losses of the people. In October this year, the Sino-Soviet Civil Aviation Joint Stock Company took the initiative to undertake the task of transporting breeding sheep by air for the Northeast People's Government. During the transportation process, the Sino-Soviet Civil Aviation Joint Stock Company automatically carried out modification and disinfection work, and prepared water and feed for the breeding sheep at the airports along the way, so that the 200 blue-haired rams from the Kunais sheep farm in Xinjiang were quickly and safely transported to Shenyang, catching up with the breeding season of the sheep, which played a direct role in the breeding of groups of blue-haired sheep with glossy hair and long hair in the Northeast region this year.

The Sino-Soviet Civil Aviation Joint Stock Company has also made significant achievements in promoting Sino-Soviet cultural exchanges and the development of China's cultural undertakings. Many classic works of Marxism-Leninism published by the Moscow Foreign Languages Publishing House, many newspapers and periodicals published in the Soviet Union, and excellent films have been quickly and timely transported to China by the company. Foreign language magazines, pictorials, and films (such as "The White-Haired Girl") published in China have also been transported to the Soviet Union by the company.

At present, Chinese cadres of the Sino-Soviet Civil Aviation Joint Stock Company are stepping up their efforts to learn from Soviet comrades' advanced experience in Soviet civil aviation and strengthen Sino-Soviet friendly cooperation, in order to further improve the operation of the Sino-Soviet Civil Aviation Joint Stock Company.

    中苏民航股份公司两年多以来成就巨大
    对中苏经济、文化交流起了重要作用
    根据中苏两国关于创办中苏民用航空股份公司的协定，中苏民用航空股份公司于一九五零年七月成立，在中苏两国同志共同努力下，特别在以谢得略列维奇同志为首的苏联同志们直接参加下，这个公司的工作获得了很大成就，对于我国经济、文化的发展以及加强中苏经济、文化的合作起了重大作用，并为新中国民用航空事业的发展做出了良好的榜样。
    两年多来，中苏民用航空股份公司坚决地实行了经济核算制，成功地执行了从工作中培养中国干部的方针，认真地采用了苏联民用航空的先进经验，绝对地保证了过去旧中国所不能保证的飞行的安全，因而业务获得迅速发展。现在中苏民用航空股份公司已经具备了一个先进的人民航空企业的规模，开辟了以北京为中心，东经沈阳、哈尔滨到苏联的赤塔，北经张家口、并经蒙古人民共和国首都乌兰巴托、抵达苏联的伊尔库茨克以及西经西安、兰州、迪化等城市到苏联的阿拉木图的三条航线，并成立了这三条航线的管理处，设立了十九个航空港站。
    中苏民航股份公司一九五一年完成的运输率比原计划提高百分之二十三，今年计划的运输率比去年提高了百分之二十一。并曾两次降低运价。财务收支已做到符合国家的要求。中苏民用航空股份公司这样迅速地成长，反映了中苏两国人民的友好合作的发展和巩固。
    随着我国经济、文化建设的日益发展，随着世界和平民主阵营之间的经济、文化交流日渐紧密，中苏民用航空股份公司的业务天天在扩大。二年多来，通过中苏民用航空股份公司空运的我国各项物资样品出口的数量以及为发展我国工业必须的机器和精密仪器的进口数量，日有增长。我国在蒙古人民共和国、德意志民主共和国和保加利亚举行的中国工业展览会的展览品，主要的都是经过中苏民用航空股份公司运送出去的。在一九五二年七月，东北林业部为了积极开发祖国丰富的森林，和中苏民用航空股份公司订立合同，规定在一九五二年黑龙江北部结冰以前，进行兴安岭森林区的飞行勘察，供应陆地勘察大队的器材和给养。中苏民航股份公司在苏联专家们，特别是古列也夫飞行处长的亲自领导下，克服了机场不完善、设备不全等困难，如期地完成这个任务，使得今年东北区顺利地开展了兴安岭地区开发森林和建设林区的工作。在一九五一年八月，东北辽河发生水灾，淹没了北宁铁路，火车停驶。中苏民航股份公司即积极地增加京赤航线的班次，维持这条重要的交通，并且配合东北人民政府，执行了向灾区空投食粮和救生圈的特殊飞行任务，对于迅速地减少人民的损失，起了很大作用。今年十月中苏民用航空股份公司主动地承受了东北人民政府空运种羊的任务。在运送过程中，中苏民用航空股份公司自动地进行了改装、消毒工作，并在沿途航空站上，为种羊准备了水草饲料，因而迅速安全地把新疆昆乃斯羊场的二百只蓝哈种羊，运抵沈阳，赶上了种羊交配时期，对于今年东北地区繁殖一群群毛质光泽、毛量多而长的蓝哈种羊，是起了直接作用的。
    中苏民用航空股份公司在促进中苏文化交流和我国文化事业的发展方面，也有显著成就。莫斯科外国文书籍出版局发行的许多马列主义的经典著作，苏联出版的许多报纸刊物以及优秀的影片都是经过该公司迅速地及时地运送到我国来。我国出版的外文杂志、画报以及影片（如“白毛女”等）也都由该公司运送到苏联去。
    目前，中苏民用航空股份公司的中国干部正在加紧向苏联同志学习苏联民用航空的先进经验，加强中苏的友好合作，为进一步办好中苏民用航空股份公司而努力。
