Editor's Note: Before leaving Beijing to visit the Northeast and Inner Mongolia Autonomous Regions, Liu Xia·Tudeng Tabar, head of the Tibetan Delegation, on behalf of all members of the delegation, broadcasted to the Tibetan local government's monastic and secular officials and all Tibetan monastic and secular compatriots on the Central People's Broadcasting Station, reporting on their journey and various activities and impressions in Beijing. Below is the full text of the broadcast speech.

Dear Tibetan Local Government's Monastic and Secular Officials and All Tibetan Secular and Monastic Compatriots:

    On May 23, 1951, Tibet was peacefully liberated, bringing all Tibetans back to our motherland's big family. Because the relationship between all nationalities in China has undergone fundamental changes, that is, on the basis of the new relationship of friendship and unity between all nationalities, the Tibetan local government sent us to Beijing, the capital of our motherland, to pay tribute to Chairman Mao, the great leader of all nationalities, and other leaders, and to visit the revolutionary progress and new atmosphere in various places. Our delegation included monastic and secular officials from the Tibetan local government, members of the Panchen Erdeni and Sakya, general representatives of the three major monasteries, and representatives from the business community, arriving from both India and Xikang. Thanks to the grace of the Central People's Government's help and the blessing of the Savior Dalai Lama, we traveled safely without any accidents. Along the way, we were warmly welcomed and seen off by leaders, cadres of government at all levels, and fraternal nationalities in various regions. After meeting in Zhengzhou, Henan Province, we arrived in Beijing, the capital, on September 29. Lin Boqu, Secretary-General of the Central People's Government, Chen Shutong, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, Li Weihan, Chairman of the Nationalities Affairs Commission of the Central People's Government, and Liu Ge Ping, Vice Chairman, along with leaders at all levels, Abbots of the Yonghe Temple and Guangji Temple, representatives of the Beijing People's Congress, and leaders of fraternal nationalities, totaling more than 300 people, came to the station to welcome us and presented us with flowers. All these people were smiling, and we felt extremely excited.
    The next evening, on the eve of the National Day, we attended Chairman Mao's banquet celebrating the third anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. The banquet was attended by envoys from various countries, representatives from 46 countries attending the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference, representatives of fraternal nationalities from home, representatives of various people's organizations, and heads of various departments of the Central Government, totaling more than 2,000 people. After the guests arrived, Chairman Mao entered the venue, and at that time, we watched intently with joy, welcoming him with thunderous applause. After Chairman Mao delivered a speech, he raised his glass and said, "Cheers to everyone's health!" Then, at the banquet, everyone continuously shouted "Long live Chairman Mao!" in various languages, and the participants also toasted each other. It could be clearly seen that everyone was expressing their irrepressible love and sincere support for the great Chairman Mao.
    On October 1st, the National Day celebrating the third anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, the great Chairman Mao and leaders at all levels, as well as distinguished guests from home and abroad who attended the aforementioned banquet, and representatives of our Tibetan, Hui, Mongolian, Uyghur, and other 40-plus fraternal nationalities were present. In front of countless people, there appeared infantry, cavalry, navy, air force and other different branches of our motherland's powerful forces that had expelled imperialism and reactionaries. At the same time, along with the army, there were trucks pulling artillery, rocket launchers, tanks, bombers and fighter planes, especially jet planes and other mechanized weapons. After seeing these unexpectedly powerful and invincible armed forces, all our fraternal nationalities increased their confidence in defeating imperialist aggression and felt honored and proud. In addition, about 500,000 men, women, old and young, including students from large, medium and small schools, workers, and farmers, participated in the conference, holding flags of various colors in their hands and marching in formation, uniformly chanting: "Long live the great Chairman Mao!" "Long live the Chinese Communist Party!" When they walked in front of the leaders, they offered flowers and raised their hands; some released many pigeons - symbols of peace, into the sky at the same time; and some released balloons that filled the sky. This love for Chairman Mao was completely sincere, not deliberately contrived. Such a wonderful and rare situation and various orderly formations had a spectacular sight that could not be described in words.
    On October 8th, after presenting flags and gifts, Chairman Mao received our Tibetan representatives and spoke cordially for more than half an hour, and gave us many profound and clear instructions in a very calm manner. The main points of these instructions are:
    1. "The Communist Party adopts a policy of protecting religion, and believers and non-believers, believers of this religion or believers of other religions, are all protected, and their beliefs are respected. Today, we adopt a policy of protecting religion, and we will continue to adopt a policy of protecting religion in the future."
    2. "The issue of land distribution is different from the issue of religion. Land has already been distributed in the Han areas, but religion is still protected here. Whether or not land will be distributed in minority areas is up to the minority nationalities themselves to decide. In Tibet, there is no question of land distribution now, and whether or not it will be distributed in the future is up to you to decide, and you will distribute it yourselves. We will not distribute it for you."
    3. "The establishment of a military and political committee and the reorganization of the Tibetan army are stipulated in the agreement. Because you are afraid, I have notified the comrades working in Tibet to implement it slowly. The agreement must be implemented, but because you are afraid, we can only implement it slowly. If you are afraid this year, we will wait until next year to implement it. If you are still afraid next year, we will wait until the year after."
    4. "Tibet is large and sparsely populated. The population needs to be developed. It would be good to develop from the current two or three million to five or six million, and then increase to ten million or more. Also, the economy and culture need to be developed. Culture includes schools, newspapers, movies, and so on, including religion. In the past, the reactionary rule of the Qing Dynasty emperors and Chiang Kai-shek oppressed and exploited you, as did the imperialists, causing your population not to develop, your economy to weaken, and your culture not to develop either. The Communist Party implements national equality, and does not want to oppress or exploit you, but to help you; to help you develop your population, develop your economy and culture. The People's Liberation Army entered Tibet to implement the policy of helping you. There will be no help at the beginning, and there may not be much help within three or four years, but later we will be able to help you, that is certain. If the Communist Party cannot help you develop your population, develop your economy and culture, then the Communist Party is of no use." Chairman Mao also said to us: "I am very happy that you have come. Recently, you can go to Nanjing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Guangzhou, the Northeast and other places to visit. In the future, if more people from all walks of life in Tibet can visit various places in the mainland, it can strengthen the relationship of unity, friendship and love between all nationalities in China." These instructions gave us a good education, and we sincerely appreciated it with unwavering confidence. Our Tibetan and fraternal nationalities representatives and the heads of various departments of the Central Government received good instructions in an atmosphere of friendship and unity at the banquet given by Commander-in-Chief Zhu of the Central People's Government's Revolutionary Military Commission on October 9th, the banquet given by Premier Zhou of the State Council of the Central People's Government on October 16th, and the banquet given by the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference on October 18th, and felt extremely happy. After we arrived in Beijing, the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference opened on October 2nd, and the Tibetan representative Geshe Sherab Gyatso attended, and some of us also attended as delegates. The Peace Conference successfully closed on the 13th. Its vivid scenes and great cause moved us very much. We firmly believe that this Peace Conference is an unprecedented sign of the arrival of happiness in Asia and the world. Now we will give a brief report on the various situations we have visited in Beijing every day and what we have seen with our own eyes up to now. The newly built road below Lhatog Gyelrong (place name) in the Tibetan area is already open, and the road from Gyelrong to Chamdo has also been built, and it may be possible to drive now. Below Derge, wasteland is being reclaimed, roads are being built, schools are being established, and factories are being built, with great development and progress. In Beijing, they can already manufacture electrical equipment, printing equipment, textile machinery, and agricultural machinery themselves. In terms of farming methods, raising dairy cows, chickens, pigs, etc., in all secular aspects (Translator's note: secular is in contrast to religious), and even in terms of song, dance and music, there has been great progress. After visiting Beijing, we will go to other provinces to visit, and we will report on those situations when we return. The above is a brief account of some of the general situations we have seen so far.
    What are our impressions after the visit? It can be explained in the following four points:
    First point: Our motherland is one of the greatest, glorious, independent and unified countries in the world. Because the people of our fraternal nationalities, who were split by the reactionary rule of national oppression in the past, have united. In the big family of their motherland, on the basis of the worker-peasant alliance, under the leadership of the working class, all nationalities in China have consolidated the friendship and cooperation between nationalities and jointly enjoyed the right to be masters of their own affairs. The reputation of this unity has spread throughout the world. This fully proves that the entire internal relations have undergone fundamental changes. Secondly, the victory of the Chinese People's Great Revolution and the founding of the People's Republic of China with a vast territory and abundant resources and a population of 500 million, not only fundamentally changed the entire Chinese nation's external relations and has become an unprecedentedly powerful national independent country, but also greatly strengthened the forces of all peace-loving people in the world who resolutely oppose the imperialist aggressive camp, making this force occupy an overwhelming advantage. Therefore, all the nationalities in all countries of the world have infinite respect and trust for Chairman Mao. For example, at his banquet celebrating National Day, as reported above, so many distinguished guests from home and abroad representing the people of all nationalities showed heartfelt admiration for Chairman Mao in every aspect, whether it was language or attitude. Nationalities with different languages and scripts shouted the slogan "Long live Chairman Mao!" in their own languages and raised their glasses to congratulate him. On National Day, October 1st, the powerful People's Army and the people of all ages, men and women, were in high spirits and marched in orderly steps, shouting the slogans "Long live Chairman Mao!" and "Long live the Chinese Communist Party!" with unrestrained excitement, demonstrating the strength of the consolidated great unity of the people of the motherland, which surprised the representatives of the Asian countries and other countries who participated in the ceremony. Representatives of the peace-loving people of 46 countries who participated in the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference unanimously expressed warm greetings to Chairman Mao and the People's Republic of China. These vivid and concrete facts fully demonstrate that the motherland is great and glorious. We also firmly believe in and deeply understand this point.
    Second point: Our motherland is powerful and has the armed forces to defeat the imperialist aggressive forces. Because the powerful People's Liberation Army is disciplined and has been forged like steel. In terms of weapons used on the battlefield, there are mechanized artillery, bombs, machine guns, etc., as well as large and small armored vehicles, tanks, rocket launchers, bombers and fighter planes, especially jet planes, and naval vessels, etc., which are all complete in every aspect. The People's Army completely defeated the Kuomintang reactionary army of more than 8 million people during the Liberation War and won a glorious victory. The above two points fully demonstrate the strength of the motherland. In the past three years, economic prosperity has been achieved, and new factories have been established to manufacture various machines. Workers have manufactured the various machines currently needed with a high degree of patriotic enthusiasm. Except for a few minority areas, land reform has been implemented in the Han areas, which account for more than 400 million people, the lives of farmers have been improved, and agricultural production has been greatly developed. Commerce and animal husbandry have also been greatly developed. In addition, great achievements have been made in political democracy and cultural development. The policy of national regional autonomy has been correctly implemented in various fraternal nationality areas, and great achievements have been made. All these forces of the people are more consolidated and stronger than before, and the unparalleled strength of the motherland is simply like this, making us feel proud.
    Third point: The various nationalities within our China have achieved a great victory in unity and equality. Because in the past, due to the dark rule of imperialism and internal reactionaries, and due to the unequal relations between the nationalities, the strong oppressed the weak. For example, although our Tibet has a large area but a small population, and everyone believes in Buddhism, politics, economy and culture have not been developed. Therefore, the Qing Dynasty emperors, the Kuomintang reactionaries, etc., only despised and enslaved us and implemented reactionary rule, and the various minority nationalities were subjected to various oppressions. Now it is not like that. Now all nationalities are equal. For example, we have been warmly welcomed and cordially received by the people's governments at all levels and the broad masses of the people along the way and here, just like our own family. Whether we visit schools, factories or markets, we are welcomed and received, and they answer all questions carefully. In addition, whether we participate in the National Day celebrations or various banquets, all nationalities, regardless of size, can sit in a row without any distinction.
    In terms of the implementation of the national policy, in the past three years, Chairman Mao's correct policy of national regional autonomy has been implemented, 130 national autonomous regions have been established, more than 200 local national democratic coalition governments have been established, and the ethnic minorities scattered in major cities have been protected so that they are no longer subjected to oppression and discrimination. It is especially worth mentioning that in August of this year, the Central People's Government promulgated three documents of great significance: the "Outline for the Implementation of National Regional Autonomy in the People's Republic of China," the "Decision on the Implementation of the Measures for Local National Democratic Coalition Governments," and the "Decision on Guaranteeing that All Scattered Ethnic Minorities Enjoy the Right to National Equality." Everyone knows that all major and minor conferences throughout the country and all levels of people's governments have representatives and personnel from all nationalities (including Tibetans) participating in the work in proportion to their population. As long as the nationalities living in concentrated communities take on the task of implementing the national policy themselves, they can implement regional autonomy under the leadership of the Central People's Government. These are all contained in a newly published booklet "National Policy Documents," which everyone will see soon. These are all concrete manifestations of national equality. In order to enable all nationalities to take on the responsibility of being masters of their own affairs, the Central People's Government has established national colleges in various places to cultivate a large number of cadres of all nationalities and to help with the living expenses of the students. In the study, the language of the nationality itself is the main language, and it is developed. As for the study of Chinese, it is entirely up to the students' own wishes and is not forced. It also helps nationalities with very small populations or no written language to create written language for learning according to their own languages. Other medical and health care, machinery science, and even music and dance, all the knowledge and skills needed in the world, can be learned. With the strong help of the Central People's Government, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has developed prosperously and happily in agriculture, trade, animal husbandry, industrial and other economic and cultural and political aspects. The Central People's Government will and is helping all nationalities to develop. Our Tibet will definitely take this path in the future. Due to time constraints, the situation of national equality cannot be described in more detail. The facts briefly described above can already illustrate that national equality is a fact that we have seen with our own eyes, and there is no need to have any doubts.
    Fourth point: There is no need to have any doubts about freedom of religious belief, protection of temples and respect for the customs and habits of ethnic minorities. In the past, imperialists and reactionaries spread rumors that the Communist Party did not allow religious belief, and that those who believed in religion were destroyed. This is completely a lie. It is not others, but the imperialists and reactionaries themselves, who oppressed our political, economic and cultural ties with religion, making it impossible to develop. Although the Communist Party itself does not believe in religion, it allows freedom of religious belief and does not interfere. This is clearly stipulated in the Common Program and the Seventeen-Article Agreement. Chairman Mao also said in person, "The Communist Party adopts a policy of protecting religion, and believers and non-believers, believers of this religion or believers of other religions, are all protected, and their beliefs are respected. Today, we adopt a policy of protecting religion, and we will continue to adopt a policy of protecting religion in the future." I have reported this point earlier. Along the way from Lhasa to Beijing, we have not seen or heard of any damage to temples of any sect, including our Yellow Sect temples. The original sources of livelihood of the Yonghe Temple and Guangji Temple in Beijing have not been damaged in any way. Some of the temples that have been in disrepair for many years are being renovated. When we went to worship at the Guangji Temple, there were Chinese monks, bhikkhus from Ceylon, and people of many nationalities from the world gathered in front of the solemn statue of our Buddha. Monks, Khenpos, and Ceylon bhikkhus solemnly offered sacrifices and chanted praises. Also, in order to promote Islam, in July of this year, representatives of 53 nationalities who believed in Islam held a grand preparatory meeting for the Islamic Association in Beijing, and a formal association will be established in the future. The meeting went smoothly and did not encounter any obstacles. The protection and assistance for religious belief has been as described above. Although land has been distributed in all Han areas, the property rights of religious believers remain untouched. The incense income of the temples we have worshiped is safe and sound. Other facts about helping religion as much as possible, such as the fact that there are representatives from the three major monasteries and Tashi Lhunpo Monastery in this Tibetan delegation, and they have received special help and care. Although we have not yet seen the full picture of our country's new atmosphere, but only from the facts we have seen and learned as mentioned above, we are completely convinced. Everyone should not have any doubts. We hope that all the monastic and secular people inside our Tibet will unite closely, and all the scattered nationalities in Tibet will also unite in friendship, and together with all fraternal nationalities in China, we will realize the Seventeen-Article Agreement on the basis of unity. For the ever-increasing progress and development of religion, politics, economy and culture, we must always follow the great Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, with the help of the Han workers and peasants. In order to transform our Tibet into a new Tibet in terms of politics, economy and culture, we must strive to eliminate the running dogs of imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries, and automatically support the resistance against America and aid Korea. On the basis of supporting the People's Liberation Army entering Tibet, we must be sincere, friendly and mutually supportive, and consolidate national defense. We must all work together to complete the above tasks. We must cherish our Buddha's teachings as we cherish our eyes and teeth.

    Long live Chairman Mao, the great leader of our people of all nationalities!
    Long live the Chinese Communist Party!
    Long live the People's Republic of China!
    Long live the Dalai Lama and Panchen Erdeni!
    Long live the great unity of the fraternal nationalities in our big family!
    Long live the peace of all Asia and the world!

    西藏致敬团团长柳霞·土登塔巴
    对西藏地方政府僧俗官员和全体藏族僧俗同胞的广播词
    编者按：西藏致敬团团长柳霞·土登塔巴，在离京赴东北、内蒙古自治区等地参观前，曾代表该团全体人员在中央人民广播电台对西藏地方政府僧俗官员和全体藏族僧俗同胞广播，报告他们沿途情况和在京期间的各种活动与观感。下面是广播词的全文。亲爱的西藏地方政府僧俗官员及全体藏族僧俗同胞们：
    一九五一年五月二十三日，西藏获得了和平解放，使全体藏族人回到了我们的祖国大家庭里来。由于中国各民族关系已起了根本上的变化，即在各民族友爱团结的新关系上，西藏地方政府才派我们到祖国的北京，向各民族人民伟大的领袖毛主席及各位首长致敬，并到各地参观革命的进步的新气象。我们有西藏地方政府的僧俗官员、班禅额尔德尼和萨迦的属员、三大寺的总代表、商界代表，是分别从印度、西康两路来的。承中央人民政府帮助的恩惠，救主达赖喇嘛的保佑，沿途平安毫无意外，沿途都受到各地区人民政府各级首长机关干部以及各兄弟民族的友爱热烈的欢迎和欢送，至河南省属郑州相会后，于九月二十九日到达首都北京。中央人民政府秘书长林伯渠、中国人民政协全国委员会副主席陈叔通、中央人民政府民族事务委员会主任委员李维汉、副主任委员刘格平等为首的各级首长、雍和宫与广济寺的执事、北京市人民代表、各兄弟民族的领袖代表等共有三百多人专诚到车站欢迎，向我们献花。所有这些人都是笑容满面的，我们也感到无比的兴奋。
    第二天晚上，适当国庆节的前夕，我们赴毛主席庆祝中华人民共和国成立三周年的宴会，参加宴会的有各国的使节，有出席亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的四十六个国家的代表，国内各兄弟民族的代表、各人民团体的代表及中央各部门的首长等共有二千多人，来宾到齐以后，毛主席到场，那时候我们高兴得目不转睛地注视着，鼓掌声如雷地表示欢迎。毛主席致词后举杯说：“为了各位的健康干杯！”接着在宴会上，以各种不同的语言大家不断地高呼“毛主席万岁！”与会人员也彼此相互敬酒。可以很明显地看到大家对伟大的毛主席流露着不可抑制的敬爱和拥护的真诚。
    十月一日庆祝中华人民共和国成立第三周年的国庆节，有伟大的毛主席和各级首长，出席上述宴会的国内外贵宾们，我们藏、回、蒙、维等四十几个兄弟民族代表。在多不胜数的人的面前，出现了我们祖国驱逐帝国主义和反动派的强大力量的步兵、骑兵、海军、空军等各种不同的兵种，同时和军队在一起的有牵引大炮的卡车、火箭炮、坦克、轰炸机和战斗机、特别是喷气式飞机等机械化的武器。看到这些意想不到的强大无敌的武装力量以后，我们各兄弟民族都增加了战胜帝国主义侵略的信心，并感到光荣骄傲。他如大、中、小学的学生，工人、农民等参加大会的男女老幼约有五十万人，他们手里拿着各种颜色的旗帜，高举在空中，排队成行地前进，大家一致欢呼：“伟大的毛主席万岁！”“中国共产党万岁！”走到首长们的面前时他们表示献花把手举起；有的把许多鸽子——和平的象征，同时放在天空；有的放气球随风飘满天空。这些对于毛主席的热爱是完全出于真诚，而不是故意做作的，这样很精彩稀奇的情况和各种有次序的行列，具有不可以言语形容的壮观。
    十月八日，在献旗献礼后，毛主席接见我藏族代表，很亲切地谈了半点多钟，而且很从容地给了我们许多深刻而明确的指示。这些指示的要点是：
    一、“共产党对宗教采取保护政策，信教的和不信教的，信这种教的或信别种教的，一律加以保护，尊重其信仰，今天对宗教采取保护政策，将来也仍然采取保护政策。”
    二、“分地的问题，与宗教问题有所不同。在汉人区域已经分了土地，这里对宗教仍然是保护的。少数民族地区分不分土地，由少数民族自己决定。西藏地区，现在谈不上分地，将来分不分，由你们自己决定，并且由你们自己去分，我们不代你们分。”
    三、“成立军政委员会和改编藏军是协议上规定了的，因为你们害怕，我通知在西藏工作的同志，要他们慢点执行。协议是要执行的，但你们害怕，只好慢点执行，今年害怕，就待明年执行，如果明年还害怕，就等后年执行。”
    四、“西藏地方大、人口少，人口需要发展，从现在二、三百万发展到五、六百万，然后再增至千几百万就好。还有经济和文化也需要发展。文化包括学校、报纸、电影等等，宗教也在内。过去的反动统治，清朝皇帝、蒋介石都是压迫剥削你们的，帝国主义也是一样，使得你们人口不得发展，经济削弱了，文化也没有发展。共产党实行民族平等，不要压迫、剥削你们，而是要帮助你们；帮助你们发展人口、发展经济和文化。人民解放军进入西藏就是要执行帮助你们的政策。开始进去的时候不会有帮助，三、四年之内也不可能有多的帮助，但以后就能帮助你们的，那是一定的。如果共产党不能帮助你们发展人口、发展经济和文化，那共产党就没有什么用处。”毛主席又对我们说：“你们来了，我很高兴，最近你们可以到南京、上海、天津、广州、东北等地去参观。以后西藏僧俗各界如果能够有更多的人到内地各处参观，便可以加强我们中国各民族之间的团结友爱的关系。”这些指示使我们得到了很好的教育，并坚信不疑地衷心感激。我们藏族和各兄弟民族代表与我中央各部门首长，在友爱团结的气氛中，在十月九日中央人民政府人民革命军事委员会朱总司令的宴会上、十六日中央人民政府政务院周总理的宴会上、以及十八日中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会的宴会上，都得到了很好的指示，感到无比的高兴。我们到了北京以后，十月二日亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议开幕，藏民代表喜饶嘉措格西参加，我们中间也有代表列席。和平会议于十三日胜利闭幕。其生动的场面和伟大的事业，使我们非常感动。我们坚信不疑，这个和平会议是争取亚洲和全世界幸福的到来的一种前所未有的标志。现在我们将北京逐日所参观到的以及截至现在亲眼看到的各种情况，作一个简单的报告。藏区在拉妥觉雄（地名）以下新修的公路已经通畅，觉雄以上至昌都间也修了路，现在可能行车了。在德格以下正在开荒、修路、设立学校、建立工厂，发展、进步很大。在北京自己已能造电料器材、印刷器材、纺织机器、农业机器。在耕作方法、养乳牛、鸡、猪等世俗的一切方面（译者注：世俗是对宗教而言的），乃至歌舞以及音乐方面，都有了很大的进步。现在在北京参观以后要到其他各省去参观，那些情况回来以后再报告。以上是我们截至现在为止已经看到的一些儿大概情况。
    我们参观了以后究竟有什么感想呢？可以用以下四点来说明：
    第一点：我们的祖国是世界上最伟大光荣的独立统一的国家之一。因为过去在民族压迫的反动统治下造成了分裂的我们各兄弟民族的人民，已经团结起来了。中国各民族在自己祖国的大家庭里，在工农联盟的基础上，在工人阶级的领导下，巩固了民族间的友爱合作，共同享受了当家作主的权利。这种团结的声誉已经传布到全世界了。这就充分证明了整个对内的关系起了根本变化。其次，中国人民大革命的胜利和拥有五亿人口的地大物博的中华人民共和国的成立，不但根本改变了整个中华民族对外的关系，已成为空前强大无比的一个民族独立的国家了，而且也大大地加强了全世界爱好和平人民坚决反对帝国主义侵略阵营的力量，使这种力量居于压倒的优势。因此，全世界的所有国家内的各民族人民对于毛主席发生了无限的敬重和信赖。例如在他庆祝国庆节的宴会上，正如上面已经报告过的，国内外那样多的代表各民族人民的贵宾们，无论语言、态度，任何方面都表现出对于毛主席的衷心敬仰，不同语言文字的各民族，以自己的言语喊出毛主席万岁的口号，并举杯祝贺。在十月一日国庆节日的那天，强大的人民军队和男女老幼人民，都是精神振奋，步伐整齐，以不能抑制的兴奋高呼“毛主席万岁！”“中国共产党万岁！”的口号，表现出巩固了的祖国人民大团结的力量，使得全亚洲及各国人民参加观礼的代表们惊奇不止。参加这次亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议四十六个国家的爱好和平人民的代表都一致对毛主席和中华人民共和国表示热烈的致意。从这些生动的具体事实上，充分表现出祖国是伟大而光荣的。这一点，我们也坚信不疑地深刻的体会到了。
    第二点：我们的祖国是强大的，具有战胜帝国主义侵略势力的武装力量的。因为强大的人民解放军纪律好，已锻炼成钢铁一般。战场上用的武器方面有机械化的大炮、炸弹、机关枪等，另外有大小装甲汽车、坦克车、火箭炮、轰炸机和战斗机、特别是喷气式的飞机、海军舰艇等，无论是从那方面说都是齐备的。人民军队在解放战争期间完全打垮了国民党反动派的军队八百多万人，获得了辉煌的胜利。以上这两点事实充分表现了祖国的强大。近三年来在经济方面获得了繁荣的发展，新建立了制造各种机器的工厂，工人们以高度的爱国热诚制造了当前必需的各种机器。除了一部分少数民族地区以外，占有人口四亿多的汉族人民地区已实现了土地改革，农民生活获得了改善，农业生产大大地发展了，商业、牧畜业也获得了很大的发展。此外政治民主、文化发展方面也有很大成就。各兄弟民族地区正确地实行了民族区域自治的政策，获得了伟大的成就。所有这些人民的团结力量比以前更加巩固和壮大了，祖国的强大无比简单地说来就是如此，使我们感到骄傲。第三点：我们中国内部的各民族得到了团结平等的伟大胜利。因为过去由于帝国主义和内部反动派的黑暗统治、由于各民族之间的不平等的关系，势力大的压迫小的，例如我们西藏土地虽大但人口稀少，所有的人都信仰佛教的关系，政治、经济、文化方面未获发展，因此清朝皇帝、国民党反动派等对我们只有轻视奴役地实行反动统治，各少数民族就那样地受着各种压迫。现在不是那样了。现在各民族一律平等了。如像我们在途中以及在这里受到各地各级人民政府和广大人民像自家人一样地热烈欢迎和殷勤招待。无论参观学校、工厂以及市场，都受到欢迎和招待，问什么情况都仔细地回答。另外无论参加国庆盛典及各种宴会，各民族无论大小都可以坐在一排，没有任何区别。
    民族政策的执行方面，过去三年中实行了毛主席的正确的民族区域自治政策，已建立了一百三十个民族自治区，已建立了地方民族民主联合政府有二百多个，并保障散居在各大城市里面的少数民族成分，使他们不再受到压迫和歧视。特别应该称道的是今年八月间中央人民政府公布了“中华人民共和国民族区域自治实施纲要”和“关于地方民族民主联合政府实施办法的决定”、“关于保障一切散居的少数民族成分享有民族平等权利的决定”三个有重大意义的文件。全国的各个大小会议和各级人民政府内各民族（包括藏族在内）都有与其人口数量适应的代表及人员参加工作，这是大家都知道的。各聚居的民族只要自己负起实施民族政策的任务时，都可以在中央人民政府的领导下实行区域自治。这些都载在一个新出版的“民族政策文件”的小册子里，大家不久就可以见到了。这些都是民族平等的具体表现。为了使各民族能够负起当家做主的责任来，中央人民政府在各地设立民族学院，以培养大量各民族自己的干部，并帮助学员的生活费用。学习中以各民族自己的语文为主，并且发展它。至于汉语的学习，完全看学员自己的志愿，不加强迫。又帮助人口极少或没有文字的民族，按照他们自己的语言，创造文字用来学习。其他医药卫生、机器科学以至音乐舞蹈，所有世间需要的知识技术，都可以学习。内蒙古自治区在农业、贸易、畜牧、工业等经济及文化、政治各方面都得到中央人民政府大力帮助，繁荣幸福地发展起来了。中央人民政府还要而且正在帮助各民族都发展起来。我们西藏将来一定也要走这条路。关于民族平等的情况，因时间的限制不能更详细地说了。从上面简单叙述的事实里已经可以说明，民族平等是我们亲眼看到的事实，不必有任何怀疑的。
    第四点：关于宗教信仰自由、保护寺庙及尊重少数民族的风俗习惯，大家心里不必有任何怀疑了。过去帝国主义和反动派造谣宣传，说共产党不许信仰宗教，信仰宗教者被毁灭，这完全是谎话。压迫我们与宗教相联系的政治经济和文化，使其不能发展的，不是别人，正是帝国主义和反动派他们自己。共产党自己虽然不信仰宗教，但允许宗教信仰自由，不加妨害。共同纲领及十七条协议中都规定得清清楚楚。毛主席也亲口说过“共产党对宗教采取保护政策，信教的和不信教的，信这种教的或信别种教的，一律加以保护，尊重其信仰，今天对宗教采取保护政策，将来也仍然采取保护政策。”这点我在前面已报告过了。从拉萨到北京来一路上所有无论那种教派的寺庙，包括我们黄教的寺庙在内，没有看到或听到有任何受到损害的。北京的雍和宫与广济寺和尚庙两处原有的生活来源都没有受到任何损害。有些年久失修的，还在修葺。我们去朝拜广济寺和尚庙的时候，在我佛世尊庄严塑像之前，有中国的和尚们，从锡兰来的比丘们，还有世界许多民族的人聚在一起。由和尚、堪布和锡兰比丘钦众隆重地献供诵赞。还有为了弘扬伊斯兰教，今年七月在北京有五十三个信仰伊斯兰教的民族代表，开了一个盛大的伊斯兰教协会筹备会议，以后还要成立正式的会，会议进行的很顺利，没有遇到任何阻碍。对于宗教信仰的保护帮助已如上述。虽然全部汉族地区都已分了土地，但宗教信仰者的财产所有权仍旧不动。我们已朝过的各寺庙的香火收入，都安然无恙。其他尽力帮助宗教的事实，例如这次西藏代表团里有三大寺和扎什伦布寺的代表，他们都得到特别的帮助和照顾。现在我们虽然还没有看见我国新气象的全部情况，但仅就上面所说的我们已经看到学习到的事实，已使我们完全相信。大家也不必有任何怀疑了。我们希望我们西藏内部的全体僧俗人民要紧密地团结，在西藏的其他散居的各民族成分也要友爱团结，并与中国境内一切兄弟民族在团结基础上一同来实现十七条协议。为了宗教、政治、经济、文化的日益进步和发展，我们要永远在伟大的毛主席和中国共产党的领导下，在汉族工农人民的帮助之下，跟着他们走。为使我们西藏在政治、经济，和文化各方面变成为一个新的西藏而奋斗。肃清帝国主义和国民党反动派的走狗，自动起来支援抗美援朝。在支援入藏的人民解放军的基础上，诚恳友好互助，巩固国防。我们大家必须为完成上述的任务而共同努力。我们要像爱护我们的眼睛和牙齿一样，使我佛圣弘扬遍在。
    我们各族人民的伟大领袖毛主席万岁！
    中国共产党万岁！
    中华人民共和国万岁！
    达赖喇嘛与班禅额尔德尼万岁！
    我们大家庭里各兄弟民族的大团结万岁！
    全亚细亚洲及全世界的和平万岁！  （新华社）
