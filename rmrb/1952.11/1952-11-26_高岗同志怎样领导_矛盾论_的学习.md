    How Comrade Gao Gang Led the Study of "On Contradiction"
    Dongbei Bureau Propaganda Department Office

    Beginning on April 18th of this year, Comrade Gao Gang personally organized and led the responsible cadres of the Dongbei Bureau in studying Comrade Mao Zedong's philosophical work, "On Contradiction." In addition to Comrade Gao Gang, those who participated in the study and regularly attended the discussions included Comrades Lin Feng, Zhang Xiushan, Li Zhuoran, Zhang Mingyuan, Kai Feng, Wang Heshou, Gu Zhuoxin, Zhang Weizhen, Ma Hong, Liu Zhiming, and more than 30 cadres above the level of section chief from various departments and commissions of the Dongbei Bureau.

    This study of "On Contradiction" by responsible cadres of the Dongbei Bureau was conducted on the basis of studying "On Practice"; it took place immediately after the great "Three-Anti" movement, amidst a general demand from responsible cadres at all levels to strengthen the study of Marxism-Leninism and Comrade Mao Zedong's works. Under the personal leadership of Comrade Gao Gang, this study effectively promoted the theoretical learning of cadres at the Dongbei level and in various provinces and municipalities, and improved the theoretical and ideological level of the cadres.

    In the process of leading the study of "On Contradiction," Comrade Gao Gang specifically applied the method of combining theory with practice. At the beginning of the study, Comrade Gao Gang required each participant to repeatedly read the document in order to grasp its spirit and essence; then, in light of the current actual work situation and in connection with the cadres' ideological understanding, questions were raised, and discussions were展开 (zhǎn kāi - initiated or carried out) according to the arguments expounded in "On Contradiction," with each question being subjected to concrete and in-depth analysis, investigation, and summarization. Comrade Gao Gang repeatedly emphasized the need to oppose both aimless and vulgar connections with "reality," and to oppose merely clinging to concepts, stubbornly delving into terms, and circling around in the text; he explained that both of these learning methods were wrong and should not be adopted.

    The study of "On Contradiction" by responsible cadres of the Dongbei Bureau was conducted precisely in accordance with the learning method pointed out by Comrade Gao Gang.

    At the discussion meetings of the Dongbei Bureau on the study of "On Contradiction," based on the questions raised by the study groups of various departments in connection with their work, the following were emphatically discussed: the contradiction problems in the current Northeast countryside, the main contradictions in the current industrial construction, the forms of contradiction and methods of struggle manifested in the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, the consistent stand of the trade union and administration in state-owned industrial and mining enterprises, the fundamental contradictions in the current class relations in our country and in the relationship with imperialism, and the internal and external causes of the success of the Chinese revolution.

    Comrade Gao Gang, in leading the study, guided everyone step by step in making an in-depth study of each issue. First, he asked everyone to present various contradictions (that is, the problems existing in the work) for analysis and research, so that everyone could understand the various aspects of each contradiction, and then comparatively examine them in a connected manner, find the main contradiction and the main aspect of the contradiction, and then further discuss the methods of resolving the contradiction. This enabled each participant to more deeply appreciate Comrade Mao Zedong's revolutionary dialectics, and at the same time to have a clearer understanding of the problems existing in the current work and their solutions.

    Comrade Gao Gang, when organizing the study, adopted the method of combining leadership with the masses, closely linking the study of responsible cadres of the Dongbei Bureau with the study of various departments and commissions. In addition to participating in the study group of the Dongbei Bureau, the members of the Dongbei Bureau personally led the study of cadres at the level of section and bureau chiefs in their respective departments. The study group of the Dongbei Bureau actually became the core of the study groups of various departments, promoting and guiding the study of various departments. Before each study discussion, Comrade Gao Gang required the members of the Dongbei Bureau to organize responsible cadres in their units to conduct brewing chats, raise questions, and initiate debates; then, the main issues of the discussion or the issues that had not been resolved in the debate were raised at the study discussion meeting of the Dongbei Bureau, and after full discussion and a consensus was reached, they were taken to the study discussion meetings of various departments for research. In this way, the study groups of various departments made the necessary brewing and preparation for the study discussion of the core group of the Dongbei Bureau, and the issues discussed and resolved by the core group of the Dongbei Bureau were precisely the issues that the comrades of the study groups of various departments required to be resolved or were unclear about. In this way, the top and bottom were combined, the core study group of the Dongbei Bureau was closely linked with the study organizations of various departments, and the cadres of various departments were able to receive timely and specific guidance on learning. Comrade Gao Gang pointed out: not only should we collect and analyze the opinions and experiences of the masses at any time in our work, seek ideological unity, and then implement it; in learning, we should also follow this method to conduct leadership, so that it is possible to clarify the essence of the problem and improve the cadres.

    Due to the leadership and promotion of Comrade Gao Gang, and due to the serious study of "On Contradiction" by responsible cadres of the Dongbei Bureau, the theoretical study of the Dongbei Bureau and various departments and commissions of the Dongbei People's Government was promoted. Under the personal leadership of their responsible comrades, various departments established study groups and conducted theoretical studies relatively seriously and with leadership, especially in the General Office, Propaganda Department of the Dongbei Bureau, and the Industry Department, Public Security Department of the Dongbei People's Government, where the learning effect was greater. At the same time, under the guidance and influence of the Dongbei Bureau, various provinces and municipalities also adopted this method, with the provincial and municipal party secretaries personally organizing study groups to study "On Practice," "On Contradiction" and other works of Comrade Mao Zedong.

    In this regard, the Industry Department of the Dongbei People's Government better implemented the method of organizing learning by Comrade Gao Gang than other departments. Since 1950, Comrades Wang Heshou, Lü Dong, An Zhiwen and others have personally organized the theoretical study of the section chiefs of the Industry Department and the bureau chiefs in Shenyang, and applied the method of combining theory with practice in the study. In this study of "On Contradiction," they also studied in detail the main contradictions in the current industrial construction in Northeast China and the methods to solve them; at the same time, they adopted the method of combining leadership with the masses to further promote the theoretical study of cadres in various subordinate bureaus and factories.

    Comrade Gao Gang's serious attitude towards studying and leading the study has also aroused the attention of cadres at all levels to the study of political theory. He served as the leader of the Dongbei Bureau's study group in name and in fact, and often carefully read Comrade Mao Zedong's works and consulted relevant materials; in order to prepare for discussions, he sometimes personally chatted with several comrades; he attended every discussion meeting on time, carefully listened to the speeches of the comrades, and made specific and clear conclusions on each issue discussed. Comrade Gao Gang exemplified the observance of the study system.

    After the conclusion of the study of "On Contradiction" by the Dongbei-level organs, the study of socialist economic construction issues began. Currently, the study of Comrade Stalin's "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR" and Comrade Malenkov's report at the 19th Congress of the CPSU and other documents is being organized.

    高岗同志怎样领导“矛盾论”的学习
    东北局宣传部办公室
    从今年四月十八日开始，高岗同志亲自组织和领导东北局的负责干部学习毛泽东同志的哲学著作“矛盾论”。参加学习和经常出席讨论会的，除高岗同志外，有林枫、张秀山、李卓然、张明远、凯丰、王鹤寿、顾卓新、张维桢、马洪、刘芝明等同志，并有东北局各部委的处长以上干部三十余人。
    这次东北局负责干部学习“矛盾论”，是在学习“实践论”的基础上进行的；是紧接着伟大的“三反”运动之后，各级负责干部普遍要求加强学习马克思列宁主义和毛泽东同志著作的情况下进行的。在高岗同志亲自领导下，这次学习有效地推动了东北一级和各省、市机关干部的理论学习，提高了干部的理论和思想水平。
    高岗同志在领导“矛盾论”学习的过程中，具体地运用了理论与实践相结合的方法。在学习开始时，高岗同志要求每个参加学习的同志首先反复阅读文件，求得领会文件的精神和实质；然后结合当前实际工作情况，联系干部的思想认识，提出问题，按照“矛盾论”阐述的论点，展开讨论，对每一问题分别作具体深入的分析、考察和归纳。高岗同志曾
    一再强调既要反对不着边际地、庸俗地乱联系“实际”；又要反对只是死扣概念，硬钻名词，在文字上打圈子；说明这两种学习方法都是错误的，都不应当采用。
    东北局负责干部的“矛盾论”学习，正是按照高岗同志所指出的学习方法进行的。
    在东北局关于“矛盾论”学习的讨论会上，根据各部门的学习小组结合其工作业务所提出的问题，曾经着重地讨论了当前东北农村中的矛盾问题、当前工业建设中主要矛盾的问题、“三反”和“五反”运动所表现的矛盾形式和斗争方法问题、国营工矿企业中工会和行政的立场一致的问题，以及我国当前国内的阶级关系上和与帝国主义的关系上的基本矛盾问题、中国革命成功的内因与外因等问题。
    高岗同志在领导学习中，是一步一步地引导大家对各个问题作深入研究。首先让大家把各种矛盾
    （也就是工作中存在的问题）摆出来，进行分析研究，使大家了解各个矛盾的各个方面，然后联系地加以对比、考察，找出主要矛盾和矛盾的主要方面，再进一步讨论解决矛盾的方法。这样就使每个参加学习的同志能较为深刻地去体会毛泽东同志的革命辩证法，同时对当前工作中存在的问题及其解决的办法有更为明确的认识。
    高岗同志在组织学习时，是采用领导与群众相结合的方法，将东北局负责干部的学习与各部委的学习紧密地联系起来。东北局委员除参加东北局的学习小组外，并亲自领导本部门的处、局长一级干部的学习。东北局的学习小组实际上就成为各部委学习小组的核心，推动和指导了各部门的学习。在每一次学习讨论之前，高岗同志要求东北局委员在本单位组织负责干部进行酝酿漫谈，提出问题，开展争论；然后把讨论的主要问题或者争论没有解决的问题提到东北局的学习讨论会上，经过充分讨论并求得一致的认识后，再拿到各部门的学习讨论会上去研究。这样，各部门的学习小组为东北局核心小组的学习讨论作了必要的酝酿和准备，而东北局核心小组所讨论和解决的问题也正是各部门学习小组的同志所要求解决或认识不清的问题。这样就使上下结合起来，使东北局的学习核心组与各部门的学习组织联系紧密，使各部门的干部能及时得到学习上的具体指导。高岗同志指出：不仅在工作中要随时集中和分析群众的意见和经验，求得思想上的一致，然后贯彻下去；在学习中，也要按照这一方法去进行领导，这样才有可能弄清问题的实质，使干部得到提高。
    由于高岗同志的领导和推动，由于东北局负责干部认真进行了“矛盾论”的学习，就推动了东北局、东北人民政府各部委的理论学习。各部门在其负责同志亲自领导下都成立了学习小组，而且比较认真地和有领导地进行了理论学习，特别是东北局办公厅、宣传部和东北人民政府工业部、公安部等单位，学习效果较大。同时各省、市在东北局的指导和影响之下，也采用这一方法，由省、市委书记亲自组织学习组，进行了“实践论”、“矛盾论”和毛泽东同志其他著作的学习。
    在这一方面，东北人民政府工业部比其他部门更好地贯彻了高岗同志组织学习的方法。他们从一九五○年开始即由王鹤寿、吕东、安志文等同志亲自组织了工业部的各处处长和在沈阳的各局局长的理论学习，并在学习中运用了理论与实际相结合的方法。这次在“矛盾论”学习中，又详细研究了当前东北工业建设中的主要矛盾及解决的办法；同时又采用了领导与群众相结合的方法，进一步推动了所属各局及各个工厂干部的理论学习。
    高岗同志认真学习和认真领导学习的态度也引起了各级干部对政治理论学习的重视。他名符其实地担任东北局的学习小组组长，经常仔细地阅读毛泽东同志的著作和参考有关的资料；为了准备讨论，他有时亲自找几个同志漫谈；每次讨论会，他都准时出席，仔细倾听同志们的发言，并对每个讨论的问题作具体的明确的结论。高岗同志模范地遵守着学习制度。
    东北一级机关“矛盾论”学习结束后，又开始了关于社会主义经济建设问题的学习。现正组织学习斯大林同志的“苏联社会主义经济问题”这一文件和联共第十九次代表大会上马林科夫同志的报告及其他文件。
