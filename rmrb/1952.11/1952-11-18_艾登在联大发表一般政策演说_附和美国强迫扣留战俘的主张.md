Xinhua News Agency, November 14th: On November 11th, British Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden delivered a general policy speech on behalf of the British government for the first time at the United Nations General Assembly. When discussing the Korean issue, Eden continued to obsequiously echo the US government's unreasonable demand of so-called "no forced repatriation of prisoners of war," which is actually forced detention of prisoners of war.

In his speech, Eden put forward his so-called "principles" regarding the Korean issue. However, Eden's "principles" are merely a clumsy restatement of the US government's position of forcibly detaining prisoners of war. Eden deliberately misinterpreted the Geneva Convention to fabricate a basis for the American aggressors' so-called "non-forcible repatriation." He dissected the right of prisoners of war to be "released and repatriated" immediately after the armistice, as stipulated by the Geneva Convention, into two separate things, namely the so-called "right to be released" and the so-called "right to be repatriated quickly." Eden's confusing remarks are obviously intended to deprive prisoners of war of their right, according to the Geneva Convention, to be released unconditionally and repatriated home, in order to facilitate the US government's detention of prisoners of war under the pretext of so-called "release." Under the name of "release," the US side has already handed over 38,000 prisoners of war to the Syngman Rhee gang. Eden's "principles," needless to say, are merely the principles of his American boss, and not the principles of the Geneva Convention, because according to the Geneva Convention, "release" and "repatriation" are absolutely inseparable. When mentioning another "principle," Eden admitted that "the detaining side has no right to use force in handling prisoners of war"; however, he deliberately avoided mentioning a well-known fact, namely that it is the American aggressors who are using force to handle prisoners of war and constantly massacring Korean and Chinese prisoners of war in prisoner-of-war camps on Jeju Island, Geoje Island, and elsewhere in order to forcibly detain prisoners of war.

When Eden talked about another so-called "principle," his fox tail was completely exposed. Eden's other "principle" is that "after the armistice, prisoners of war cannot be forcibly detained, nor can they be forcibly repatriated." Eden attempted to use this confusing statement to deceive other countries and induce them to agree with the US's proposal of "no forced repatriation of prisoners of war," which is aimed at detaining prisoners of war. But everyone knows that it is the US government that is forcibly detaining prisoners of war. Regarding this point, the Korean and Chinese sides have living witnesses, that is, the prisoners of war who were forcibly detained by the US side to serve as airborne spies. In order to continue to forcibly detain prisoners of war after the armistice, the United States fabricated a groundless and unreasonable so-called "non-forcible repatriation." Therefore, to oppose forced detention, it is necessary to oppose "non-forcible repatriation," which is aimed at forced detention. Since Eden agreed with the US government's proposal of "no forced repatriation of prisoners of war," he also agreed with the US government's forced detention of prisoners of war, and therefore his so-called principle that prisoners of war "cannot be forcibly detained" is completely deceptive.

Eden's speech at the United Nations General Assembly shows that the British government, regardless of the British people's strong demand for the realization of an armistice in Korea, continues to follow the US government's war policy and is trying in every possible way to enable the US government's unreasonable demand for the forced detention of prisoners of war to be adopted by the United Nations General Assembly. Although Eden shamelessly lied that his fraudulent "principles" were based on "the requirements of common sense and ordinary human feelings," people have clearly seen that he is merely dancing to the tune of the dollar.

### 艾登在联大发表一般政策演说  附和美国强迫扣留战俘的主张

    艾登在联大发表一般政策演说
    附和美国强迫扣留战俘的主张
    【新华社十四日讯】十一月十一日，英国外交大臣艾登在联合国大会上首次代表英国政府发表一般政策演说。艾登在演说中论及朝鲜问题时，仍然奴颜婢膝地附和美国政府的所谓“不强迫遣返战俘”实则强迫扣留战俘的无理主张。
    艾登在演说中谈到朝鲜问题时提出了他的所谓“原则”。但是，艾登的这些“原则”不过是用并不巧妙的方式重述美国政府的强迫扣留战俘的主张罢了。艾登故意曲解日内瓦公约，来替美国侵略者的所谓“不强迫遣返”编造根据。他把日内瓦公约规定的战俘在停战以后立即被“释放并遣返”的权利，拆开成为两个，即所谓“被释放的权利”和所谓“被迅速遣返的权利”。艾登的这种混乱的言论显然是意图把战俘根据日内瓦公约全部无条件释放并遣返回家的权利加以剥夺，来便利美国政府利用所谓“释放”的名义扣留战俘。在“释放”的名义下，美方已把三万八千名战俘送交李承晚匪帮。艾登的这种“原则”，不用说只是他的美国老板的原则，而不是日内瓦公约的原则，因为按照日内瓦公约，“释放”与“遣返”是绝对不能分开的。艾登在提到另一“原则”时，承认“扣留方面在处理战俘时没有权利使用武力”；但是，他却有意不提一个举世周知的事实，即在处理战俘中使用武力的，正是为了强迫扣留战俘而在济州岛、巨济岛等战俘营中不断大量屠杀朝中战俘的美国侵略者。
    艾登在谈到另一个所谓“原则”时，他的狐狸尾巴就完全暴露出来了。艾登的另一个“原则”是“在停战以后，战俘既不可以被强迫扣留，也不可以被强迫遣返”。艾登企图用这种混淆是非的说法来欺骗其他国家，诱使它们同意美国的旨在扣留战俘的“不强迫遣返战俘”的主张。但是谁都知道，强迫扣留战俘的不是别人，正是美国政府。关于这一点，朝中方面手里有着活生生的见证人，这就是被美方强迫扣留下来充当空降特务的战俘。美国为了企图在停战以后继续强迫扣留战俘，才捏造一个毫无根据、毫无道理的所谓“不强迫遣返”。因此，要反对强迫扣留，就必须同时也反对以强迫扣留为目的的“不强迫遣返”。艾登既然同意了美国政府的“不强迫遣返战俘”的主张，也就是同意美国政府强迫扣留战俘，因而他的所谓战俘“不可以被强迫扣留”的原则完全是欺人之谈。
    艾登在联合国大会上的演说表明：英国政府不顾英国人民对实现朝鲜停战的强烈要求，继续追随美国政府的战争政策，并且多方设法企图使美国政府的强迫扣留战俘的无理主张能够在联合国大会上通过。虽然艾登无耻地撒谎说他提出这些欺诈性的“原则”是“根据常理及普通人情的要求”的，但是人们已经清楚地看到，他只是按照美元的指挥在跳舞而已。
