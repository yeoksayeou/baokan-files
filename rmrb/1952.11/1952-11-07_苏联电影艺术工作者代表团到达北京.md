Those who went to the airport to welcome them included: Qian Junrui, Secretary-General of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association; Yan Baohang, Deputy Secretary-General; Shen Yanbing, Minister of the Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government; Zhou Yang, Deputy Minister; Wang Lanxi, Deputy Director of the Film Bureau of the Ministry of Culture; Cai Chusheng, Director of the Art Committee of the Film Bureau of the Ministry of Culture; Shi Dongshan, Director of the Technical Committee; Luo Guangda, General Manager of the China Film Distribution and Exhibition Corporation; Yu Ji, Deputy Director of the Film Department of the General Political Department of the People's Revolutionary Military Commission of the Central People's Government; Chen Bo, Director of the Film Studio of the General Political Department of the People's Revolutionary Military Commission of the Central People's Government; the heads of Beijing Film Studio, Northeast Film Studio, Shanghai Film Studio, and Shanghai United Film Studio; and many figures from the capital's literary, art, and film circles, such as Sha Kefu, Tian Han, He Shide, Tian Hua, and Yu Lan.

Also present at the airport to welcome them were: Gudev, Chargé d'affaires ad interim of the Soviet Embassy; Zhukoff, representative of the Soviet Society for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries; and S.F. Ford, General Representative of the Soviet Film Export Company in China, and his deputy, Mirikov. After Fedorov and others disembarked from the plane, they accepted flowers presented by members of the Central Song and Dance Troupe and students from the Central Film Bureau Film School. Shen Yanbing, on behalf of the Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government and the national literature and art and film workers, extended the warmest welcome to the Soviet Film Artists Delegation and members of the Soviet Art Troupe. Shen Yanbing said: Soviet literature, art, and film have had an immeasurable influence on the Chinese people and Chinese literature, art, and film. Soviet films have provided great help to the growth of the young Chinese people's film industry. The works of Soviet filmmakers have set a brilliant example of high ideological and artistic quality for Chinese filmmakers. Shen Yanbing concluded by saying: The arrival of Soviet artists and filmmakers in our country, and the upcoming opening of the Soviet film exhibition, will further consolidate and develop the friendship between the peoples of China and the Soviet Union and between the cultural and artistic and film workers of the two countries, and will provide more direct and effective help to Chinese cultural workers, especially filmmakers.

Delegation leader Fedorov expressed his gratitude for the warm and friendly welcome of the Chinese people, saying: We are very honored to come to the great People's Republic of China for the first time in our lives. We have come to China at a time when people all over the world are warmly celebrating the 35th anniversary of the October Socialist Revolution, a day that not only liberated the working people of our country but also opened a new era in world history. Fedorov continued: We Soviet people are watching with great concern the achievements of the Chinese people in economic and cultural construction. The Soviet people love Chinese films very much, such as "The White Haired Girl," "Steel Warrior," and "Sons and Daughters of China." Last year, the Soviet Union held a Chinese film exhibition, and the visit of the Chinese film workers delegation to the Soviet Union played a great role in enhancing the friendship between the peoples of China and the Soviet Union and strengthening the cooperation between the artistic workers of the two countries. The visit of the Soviet Film Artists Delegation to China this time will undoubtedly play a great role in developing and consolidating the friendship between the peoples of China and the Soviet Union. He concluded by shouting: "Long live the great friendship between the peoples of China and the Soviet Union!" "Long live Chairman Mao Zedong, the great leader of the Chinese people!" and "Long live Marshal Stalin, the leader and teacher of the progressive mankind all over the world!"

After Fedorov's speech, he introduced the members of the delegation to the welcomers one by one, and the whole audience applauded warmly.
