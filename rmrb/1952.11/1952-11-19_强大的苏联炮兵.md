Powerful Soviet Artillery
    Liang Bofu Moshikesiji
    This year on November 19th, the entire Soviet Union will celebrate the traditional holiday - Soviet Artillery Day - in an atmosphere of unprecedented political and labor upsurge. The 19th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks), which recently closed, is an important milestone in the history of the Soviet people and all progressive humanity. The resolutions of the 19th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) and the historic speech by Comrade Stalin at the closing session are a great program for mobilizing the Soviet people to successfully build communism and inspiring progressive people around the world to fight for international peace and against war instigators.
    The hearts of the laborers in socialist countries are filled with joy and pride. The great socialist power has never achieved such great accomplishments as it does now. But what we have achieved is not the limit; the resolutions passed by the 19th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) have opened up new and more magnificent prospects for the construction of communism.
    When celebrating Artillery Day, the Soviet people give due honor to their loyal sons - the fearless warriors - who defended the victorious achievements of the Great October Socialist Revolution, protected the glory, freedom, and independence of the motherland, and rescued mankind from fascist enslavement in the heroic battles against the Hitler aggressors and Japanese imperialists.
    In the great historical victory achieved in the Patriotic War, the Soviet artillery, as the main striking force of the Soviet army, played a very important role. To commend the outstanding feats of the Soviet artillery in the Great Patriotic War, Comrade Stalin wrote in Order No. 225 issued on November 19, 1944:
    "...The Red Army was able to stop the enemy's advance at Leningrad and Moscow thanks to the help of artillery power.
    The Red Army was able to crush the German army near Stalingrad and Voronezh, near Kursk and Belgorod, near Kharkov and Kiev, near Vitebsk and Bobruisk, near Leningrad and Minsk, near Iasi and Kishinev, thanks to the guarantee of artillery power. ...
    Everyone knows that the Soviet artillery won complete dominance over the enemy's artillery on the battlefield. Soviet artillerymen and mortar men gained immortal glory of supreme bravery and fortitude in many battles with the enemy, and commanders and officers demonstrated the highest art of commanding firepower."
    (Stalin, "On the Great Patriotic War of the Soviet Union," Russian edition, pages 175-176)

    Soviet artillery has grown into a powerful arm of the military during the years of the Soviet regime and occupies a glorious position in the Soviet armed forces system. The brilliant achievements of Soviet artillery in the battles to defend the independence of the motherland should first be attributed to the Communist Party and the genius of Lenin and Stalin. The great leader established the Soviet army and paid great attention to the development of artillery. Comrade Stalin laid the foundation of Soviet military science and established a rigorous science regarding the organization, equipment, and combat application of artillery. He directly guided the issue of establishing new artillery weapons in design thinking.
    Stalin pointed out the direction of development of anti-tank guns and the requirements that giant cannons should meet. None of the types of cannons created by Soviet designers did not embody Stalin's instructions.
    As early as the Civil War, the young Soviet artillery became a threat to the enemy. In the heroic defense of Tsaritsyn commanded by Comrade Stalin, the Soviet artillery played a significant role. Near the Vorobyanovo station, according to Comrade Stalin's order, a powerful artillery group was established, which used its firepower to destroy the White Army's offensive against Tsaritsyn.
    The concentrated use of artillery fire, which played a significant role in Tsaritsyn, Perekop, and other battles, later became the basis for the combat application of Soviet artillery.
    In subsequent battles: at Lake Khasan, at Khalkhin Gol, and in the war with the Finnish White Army, the Soviet artillery forces, possessing new and the world's most advanced cannons and combat technology, demonstrated full superiority over the enemy's artillery.
    The growing power of Soviet artillery, as the main striking force of the Soviet army, was particularly evident during the years of the Great Patriotic War. In this war, it could be seen that there was no fortress that could not be destroyed for the Soviet artillery. Soviet artillery crushed the enemy's tanks and artillery with concentrated and accurate firepower, annihilated the enemy's dense troops, destroyed fortifications, and shattered the enemy's tactical and strategic attempts. Comrade Stalin said when analyzing the role of artillery in modern warfare: "Artillery is the god of war."
    Even in the first period of the war - the most difficult period - Soviet artillery was the main force that restrained the fascist tank army. In the summer and autumn of 1941, the Soviet artillery fire caused huge and irreparable losses to the Hitler aggressors. Approximately 300 enemy tanks were destroyed in the Shaulyai area alone. The enemy's 39th Tank Corps was crushed near Minsk. The fascist 14th Tank Division also suffered defeat in Ukraine. However, in the first period of the war, the enemy still had a great advantage in technology, especially in tanks and air force. The task at that time was to eliminate this advantage.
    The laborers of Soviet industry, carrying out the tasks given by Comrade Stalin, while expanding the production of tanks and aircraft, also greatly increased the production of cannons, especially anti-tank guns and anti-aircraft guns, mortars and jet weapons. This enabled the Soviet army to equip dozens of new destructive anti-tank, anti-aircraft, and mortar units and combined corps.
    Workers, engineers, and technicians in artillery factories, with selfless labor, not only ensured compensation for losses, but also constantly expanded the number of various artillery pieces. In the last three years of the war alone, the Soviet army could obtain nearly 120,000 various cannons from the industry every year. The mortar industry produced nearly 100,000 pieces every year from 1942 to 1944.
    This made it possible to establish powerful artillery deployments to participate in combat. Thus, the famous offensive of the Soviet army near Stalingrad on November 19, 1942, began under the firepower of more than 4,000 cannons. In the battles in Belarus in 1944, there were 15,000 cannons in the main attack direction of the Soviet army alone. In the concluding battle - the Battle of Berlin - the Soviet army had more than 41,000 cannons and mortars.
    Soviet artillery solved the problem of coordinating operations with other arms of the military in the latest way. Following Comrade Stalin's instructions, Soviet artillery successfully solved the task of constantly accompanying the attacking troops with "firepower and wheels." The coordinated operations of artillery with other arms of the military gave the enemy a powerful blow, causing heavy losses to the enemy's personnel and technology. During the war, the fact that the anti-aircraft artillery units shot down more than 26,000 enemy aircraft alone is sufficient to illustrate this.
    Soviet artillery played a very important role in the war against Japan. The firepower of Soviet artillery destroyed the fortified defensive works of the Kwantung Army, thus enabling the rapid defeat of Japanese imperialism and the liberation of the peoples of the Far East.
    On all fronts of the war against the Hitler aggressors and Japanese samurai, Soviet artillery, like other units of the Soviet army, demonstrated examples of high military skills, unparalleled strength, and bravery. Their heroic feats are written in brilliant words in the annals of the Soviet people's struggle for the independence and freedom of the socialist motherland.
    The Soviet government highly appreciates the achievements of the artillery. During the war, thousands of soldiers, non-commissioned officers, officers, and generals were awarded medals and decorations. More than 1,600 artillery combatants became Heroes of the Soviet Union.
    The heroic Soviet army, including the war-tested and powerful Soviet artillery, is firmly defending the Soviet people who are victoriously building communism and world peace.

    强大的苏联炮兵
    梁波夫  莫什可夫斯基
    今年十一月十九日，苏联全国将在政治与劳动空前高涨的情形下来庆祝传统的节日——苏联炮兵节。不久以前闭幕的联共第十九次代表大会，是苏联人民与全体进步人类历史上的重要里程碑。联共第十九次代表大会的决议与斯大林同志在闭幕会上的历史性的演说，是动员苏联人民顺利建设共产主义，鼓舞世界进步人士为争取国际和平与反对战争挑拨者而斗争的战斗与胜利的伟大纲领。
    社会主义国家的劳动者的内心充满着愉快和自豪。伟大的社会主义强国从来也没有像现在这样的巨大成就。但是我们所达到的成就并不是极限；联共第十九次代表大会所通过的决议为她开辟了共产主义建设的新的、更加壮丽的远景。
    在庆祝炮兵节的时候，苏联人民给与自己忠实的儿子——无畏的战士们以应得的荣誉，他们在与希特勒侵略者和日本帝国主义者的英勇战斗中，保卫住了伟大十月社会主义革命的胜利成果，保卫了祖国的光荣、自由与独立，从法西斯的奴役下拯救了人类。
    在卫国战争中所获得的伟大历史性胜利的战绩中，做为苏联军队主要打击力量的苏联炮兵，起了非常的作用。为了表彰苏联炮兵在伟大卫国战争中的卓越战功，斯大林同志在一九四四年十一月十九日所发布的第二百二十五号命令中写道：
    “……红军在列宁格勒和莫斯科阻止了敌人的前进，是有赖于炮兵力量底帮助。
    红军在斯大林格勒和沃龙涅什附近，在库尔斯克和别尔果洛得附近，在哈尔科夫和基也辅附近，在威特彼斯克和波伯雷斯克附近，在列宁格勒和明斯克附近，在雅西和基什涅夫附近粉碎德军，是有赖于炮兵力量的保证。……
    大家知道，苏联炮兵夺得了在战场上对敌人炮兵的完全统治地位，苏联炮手和迫击炮手在与敌人进行多次战斗中，获得了无上英勇刚毅的永不磨灭的光荣，而指挥官和长官都表现了指挥火力的最高艺术。”
    （斯大林“论苏联伟大卫国战争”俄文版第一七五—一七六页）

    苏联炮兵在苏维埃政权的年代中成长为一支强大的兵种部队，并在苏联的武装力量的体系中占有光荣的地位。苏联炮兵在保卫祖国独立的战斗中所获得的彪炳战绩，首先应归功于共产党和列宁斯大林的天才。伟大的领袖建立了苏军，对于炮兵的发展予以非常的注意。斯大林同志奠定了苏联军事科学的基础，建立了关于炮兵的组织、装备和战斗运用的严整科学。他在设计思想上直接指导关于建立炮兵新兵器的问题。
    斯大林指出了反坦克炮的发展方向，指出了巨型炮所应该适应的要求。苏联设计师所创造的炮，没有一种类型不是体现了斯大林的指示的。
    还在内战时期，年轻的苏联炮兵就成了敌人的威胁。在斯大林同志所指挥的英勇的察里津保卫战中，苏联的炮兵曾起了重大的作用。在伏罗巴诺沃车站附近，依照斯大林同志的命令，建立了强大的炮兵群，这个炮兵群以自己的火力摧毁了白卫军对察里津的进攻。
    在察里津、彼列科普附近和其他战役中起了重大作用的集中使用的炮火，后来成为苏军炮兵战斗运用的基础。
    在以后的历次战役中：在哈桑湖、哈勒欣河，在与芬兰白军战争时，拥有新式的、世界上最完善的大炮和战斗技术的苏联炮兵部队，显示出对于敌人炮兵的充分优越性。
    作为苏军主要打击力量的苏联炮兵的增长着的威力，在伟大的卫国战争年代里，特别明显地表现了出来。在这次战争中可以看出，对于苏联炮兵说来，没有不能摧毁的堡垒。苏联炮兵以集中的和准确的火力粉碎了敌人的坦克和炮兵，歼灭了敌人密集的军队，破坏了工事，粉碎了敌人的战术的和战略的企图。斯大林同志在分析现代战争中的炮兵的作用时说：“炮兵是战争之神。”
    还是在战争的第一个时期——最困难的时期里，苏联炮兵便是那抑制住法西斯的坦克大军的主要力量。一九四一年夏秋二季，苏联的炮火曾使希特勒侵略者遭到了巨大的无法弥补的损失。仅仅在沙乌梁依区即击毁敌人的约三百辆坦克。在明斯克附近粉碎了敌人的第三十九坦克军。法西斯的第十四坦克师在乌克兰也遭到了失败。但是在战争的第一个时期，敌人在技术上、特别是在坦克和空军上还有很大的优势，当时的任务就是消灭这种优势。
    苏联工业的劳动者们执行着斯大林同志所给予的任务，与扩大坦克和飞机的生产同时，也大大增加了大炮的生产，尤其是反坦克炮和高射炮、迫击炮和喷射武器。这使得苏联军队装备了数十个新的歼灭性的反坦克炮的、高射炮的和迫击炮的部队与联合兵团。
    制炮工厂的工人和工程师、技术人员们以忘我的劳动不仅保证补偿了损失，而且还经常扩大各种炮的数量。仅在战争的最后三年，苏联军队每年便可从工业方面获得近十二万门的各种战炮，迫击炮工业在一九四二年至一九四四年期间内，每年生产将近十万门。
    这使得有可能建立强有力的各种炮兵配备，参加战斗。这样，一九四二年十一月十九日苏军在斯大林格勒附近的著名进攻，是在四千多门大炮的火力下开始的。一九四四年在白俄罗斯的战斗中，仅在苏军的主攻方向就有一万五千门大炮。在结束的战役——柏林战役——中，苏军拥有四万一千多门大炮和迫击炮。
    苏联炮兵按最新的方式解决了与其他各种兵种配合作战的问题。遵照斯大林同志的指示，苏联炮兵成功地解决了用“火力和车轮”不断伴随进攻部队的任务。炮兵与其他兵种的协同作战，给敌人以强有力的打击，使敌人的有生力量和技术方面遭受了重大的损失。在战争期间，仅高射炮部队就击落了二万六千多架敌机这一件事，即足以说明了。
    苏联的炮兵在对日作战中起着最重要的作用。苏联炮兵的火力曾摧毁了关东军的牢固的防御工事，因而能够迅速地战胜日本帝国主义和解放远东各民族。
    在与希特勒侵略者和日本武士作战的各个战线上，苏联的炮兵，也像苏军其他部队一样，表现出高度的军事技巧的范例，表现出无与伦比的坚强和勇敢。他们的英勇战绩以灿烂的语句写入了苏联人民为社会主义祖国的独立和自由而斗争的史册中。
    苏联政府对于炮兵的功绩是予以高度的评价的。在战争期间，数以千计的战士、士官、军官和将军曾被授以勋章和奖章。一千六百多名炮兵战斗员成为苏联英雄。
    英勇的苏军，其中包括受过战争考验的强有力的苏联炮兵，正在牢固地保卫着胜利地建设共产主义的苏联人民与世界和平。
