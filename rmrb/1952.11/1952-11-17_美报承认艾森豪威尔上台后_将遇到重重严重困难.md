Xinhua News Agency, 16th: After Republican presidential candidate Eisenhower was elected, in addition to the loud praise of this loyal servant of Wall Street, the American bourgeoisie's discourse had to admit that Eisenhower would face serious difficulties in implementing the U.S. imperialist policy of aggression and war preparations.

The "New York Times," which strongly supported Eisenhower, said after the election results were announced: "The Republican Party will face a variety of serious problems after taking office in Washington in two months." The Republican Party's organ, the "New York Herald Tribune," also admitted that "the coming months will be a test period for Eisenhower, the Republican Party, and the nation." The "Baltimore Sun" said in its editorial on the 5th: "We do not believe that General Eisenhower will bring a peaceful world. In fact, his administration will probably not be an easy task." The "Washington Star" also pointed out in its editorial on the 5th that Eisenhower had "no easy way out," and said: "The next four years will be difficult years."

The fact that so many disheartening comments are appearing just after a new president has been elected reflects the current difficult situation in the United States. Eisenhower came to power because Wall Street bosses called him up to take over the broken-down mess of the Truman administration, replacing a batch of people to prop up a situation that was difficult to sustain. But even before he was elected, bourgeois commentary already hinted that Eisenhower would not be any more fortunate than Truman.

The number one problem now facing Eisenhower is how to salvage the failure of the war of aggression against Korea. Few people, including Eisenhower's supporters, believe that Eisenhower will have any good way to salvage the defeat in the war of aggression against Korea. The "New York Times" military commentator Baldwin said that even if Eisenhower personally went to Korea, it would "not produce miracles."

How to eliminate the widespread anti-American sentiment in Western Europe and intensify U.S. control over these countries is another problem. Regarding this, the United States Information Service said on October 26th: "The new U.S. government will immediately encounter many difficult problems." The United States Information Service pointed out: Western European countries "still insist on taking more initiative and making greater efforts to produce and sell more competitively than in the past." Furthermore, "there is a growing conviction that Europeans do not want to be the 'poor relatives' of Americans, they would rather 'find their own way out' than continue to 'reach out' to the United States."

In other parts of Asia, Eisenhower will also encounter many difficulties in rearming Japan, supporting France in the Vietnam War, and organizing the Pacific aggressive bloc. Agence France-Presse Washington, 5th, said: Eisenhower is facing a "nightmare-like dilemma" in this regard. Agence France-Presse added: "The greatest hope for the new government may be to achieve limited success in the Far East."

In the Middle East and Near East, the rising tide of movements for national independence is another thorny issue that Eisenhower will encounter. Eisenhower himself has admitted that "innumerable economic tensions exist everywhere" in the Middle East and Near East, which could "turn into political disasters."

Domestically in the United States, the outbreak of an economic crisis has been generally recognized as only a matter of time. "New York Post" columnist Burt was already saying on October 20th: "Whether Eisenhower or Stevenson becomes our next president, it (the economic panic) will always fall on our heads." United Press International Washington, October 22nd, said: "Economists inside and outside the government 'unanimously' believe that a business recession will definitely occur in late 1953 or early 1954."

In this situation, even within the Republican Party, there is concern about the bleak prospects of the new Eisenhower government. Republican elder statesman and former President Hoover said on the 5th: "The problems before us are much more difficult than those debated in this campaign."

    美报承认艾森豪威尔上台后  将遇到重重严重困难
    【新华社十六日讯】美国共和党总统候选人艾森豪威尔当选以后，美国国内资产阶级的言论除了大吹大擂地颂扬这位华尔街的忠仆以外，不得不承认：艾森豪威尔今后在执行美国帝国主义的侵略备战政策时将遇到严重困难。
    极力支持艾森豪威尔的“纽约时报”在大选揭晓后说：“共和党在两个月之内在华盛顿登台以后将面对种种严重问题。”共和党机关报“纽约先驱论坛报”也承认“今后数月对于艾森豪威尔、共和党和全国都是一个考验时期。”“巴尔的摩太阳报”在五日的社论中说：“我们不相信艾森豪威尔将军会带来太平盛世。实在说来他的执政大概不是一件轻易的事。”“华盛顿明星报”在五日的社论中也指出艾森豪威尔并“没有轻易的出路”，并说：“今后的四年将是困苦的年代。”
    一位新总统刚刚当选，就有这许多煞风景的评论，是美国目前处境困难的反映。艾森豪威尔上台，本来是由于华尔街老板叫他上来接替杜鲁门政府这个破烂摊，更换一批人马，支撑难以为继的局面。但是在他当选以后甚至在当选以前，资产阶级的评论就已经暗示，艾森豪威尔也不会比杜鲁门更交运些。
    现在摆在艾森豪威尔面前的头号难题就是如何挽回侵略朝鲜战争的失败。很少人，包括艾森豪威尔的支持者在内，都不相信艾森豪威尔会有什么挽回侵朝战争败局的好办法。“纽约时报”军事评论员鲍尔温就说，即使艾森豪威尔亲自到了朝鲜，也“并不能产生奇迹”。
    如何消弥西欧方面普遍抗拒美国的情绪，加紧美国对这些国家的控制是另一个难题。关于这方面，美国新闻处十月二十六日说：“美国的新政府将要立刻遇到许多困难问题。”美国新闻处指出：西欧各国“仍然坚持主张采取更多的主动与更大的努力来比过去更富竞争性地进行生产和推销”。并且，“现在有着一种越来越强的信念，就是：欧洲人不愿意做美国人的‘穷亲戚’，他们宁愿‘自找出路’，而不愿继续向美国‘伸手’。”
    在亚洲其他地区，艾森豪威尔在重新武装日本、支持法国进行越南战争、组织太平洋侵略集团等方面也将遭遇到重重困难。法新社华盛顿五日电说：艾森豪威尔在这方面正面临一个“梦魇般的进退维谷之境”。法新社并说：“新政府如能在远东取得局限的成功或许就算是最大的希望了。”
    在中东、近东，要求民族独立的运动的高涨是艾森豪威尔将要碰到的另一个棘手问题。艾森豪威尔自己就曾承认，在中东和近东“各处都存在有不可胜数的经济紧张局势”，这种局势可能“转变成政治灾难”。
    在美国国内，经济危机的爆发已被公认为仅仅是时间问题。“纽约邮报”专栏作家卜特在十月二十日就已经在说：“不论艾森豪威尔或是史蒂文森做我们下一届总统，它（经济恐慌）总会落到我们头上。”合众社华盛顿十月二十二日电说：“政府内外的经济学家‘一致’认为在一九五三年底或一九五四年初，一定会发生企业衰退。”
    在这种情况下，就连共和党内部对艾森豪威尔新政府的这种黯淡前途也表示忧心忡忡。共和党元老，前总统胡佛在五日说：“在我们面前的问题比在这次竞选中所辩论的问题要艰难得多。”
