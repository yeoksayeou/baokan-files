    Production and Financial Plan - The Action Program of Enterprises
    ——Introduction to the Advanced Experience of China Changchun Railway (1)
    Yin Zijia, Deputy Director of the Planning Department of China Changchun Railway Administration

    I. Enterprise Plans Must Reflect the Policies of the Party and the State

    Under the enthusiastic guidance and active participation of Soviet experts, the China Changchun Railway completed the planning work for 1950, 1951, and 1952; completed the annual and quarterly analyses for 1950 and 1951, and prepared the quarterly revised plans for the fourth quarter of 1951 and the third and fourth quarters of 1952. We are currently rushing to compile the 1953 plan. Over the past three years, we have deeply realized in our planning work that it is unimaginable to manage a state-owned enterprise well without a high-quality production and financial plan as the action program for all employees, a plan that comes "from the masses and goes to the masses."

    The enterprise plan is an integral part of the state's unified economic plan, and the state's unified economic plan embodies the political and economic tasks of the state in a certain period. Planners should formulate plans with a high sense of responsibility to the people, the Party, and the state, and with a spirit of seeking truth from facts, striving for high-quality plans that conform to policies. To this end, we should proceed from the perspective of promoting advanced production technology and operating procedures, advanced labor organization and labor quotas, and advanced consumption quotas for raw materials, fuel, electricity, etc.; we should prescribe the maximum safe utilization rate of machinery and equipment to achieve the full potential of the enterprise, improve equipment utilization, increase labor productivity, reduce product costs, expand enterprise profits, increase national accumulation, improve the material and cultural life of employees, and ensure the implementation of the safety production policy.

    The production and financial plan of the China Changchun Railway not only implements the policies of "increasing production and practicing economy" and "accumulating capital," but also emphasizes safety production. Soviet experts often told their Chinese comrades: "People are the most valuable asset." Under the guidance of this noble idea of Soviet experts, the production and financial plan stipulates a certain amount of funds for labor protection, technical safety, and work clothes. For example, it was 8.9 billion yuan in 1951 and 10.2 billion yuan in 1952. Failure to use or underuse this fund and other expenses would be severely criticized, and exceptionally, inter-quarter use of this fund could be permitted.

    The production and financial plan of the China Changchun Railway embodies the policies of the Party and the state, and is also reflected in the training of cadres. The plan in 1951 stipulated this expense as 6.7 billion yuan, and in 1952 as 11.8 billion yuan. With the active organization, promotion, and sincere help of Soviet experts, over the past three years, tens of thousands of new cadres have been trained.

    II. The Relationship Between Railway Transportation Plan and Other Economic Sectors of the State

    Since the railway transportation plan is an integral part of the national economic plan, it should closely cooperate with other state-owned enterprises and must closely integrate the transportation plan with industrial production plans, agricultural production plans, commodity circulation plans, national trade plans, and so on. Therefore, the railway must maximize its transportation efficiency on the basis of rational transportation to serve the various economic sectors and factories and mines of the country; and the various economic sectors and factories and mines of the country must also submit reasonable consignment plans in accordance with the state's unified economic plan and ensure that goods are prepared on time as much as possible. Only when the railway and the various economic sectors, factories, and mines of the country cooperate rhythmically can the completion of the state's transportation plan be guaranteed, the completion of the production plans of other economic sectors of the country be guaranteed, and thus the completion of the state's unified economic plan be guaranteed. Scheduled transportation accounted for 72% of the total transportation volume of the China Changchun Railway in 1951 and 68% in the first, second, and third quarters of 1952.

    In order to complete the state's unified economic plan, planned consignment by major state-owned economic sectors is of great significance. If it were not for the determination of Soviet experts to insist on the unconditional completion of the state-approved plan in the China Changchun Railway in 1951 and the first nine months of 1952, then the transportation plans of the China Changchun Railway in 1951 and the first nine months of 1952 would have been difficult to complete. Unplanned transportation accounted for 28% of the total in 1951 and 32% in the first nine months of 1952. The problem is very clear: without Soviet experts resolutely advocating the search for cargo sources, the 28% of cargo in 1951 and the 32% of cargo in the first nine months of 1952 could not have been transported. This would not only have affected the China Changchun Railway's failure to complete the tasks assigned by the state but would also have affected the failure of various state-owned enterprises to complete their production plans. What a great loss this would be to the country! In order to ensure the completion of the state's unified economic plan, the railway must strive to sign transportation contracts with state-owned economic sectors with the help of the Party and the government, consolidate the transportation plan in this contract form, make the state's transportation move towards planning as soon as possible, overcome blindness, and reduce the time of unproductive stoppage of thousands of freight cars on dedicated lines.

    III. Grasp the Key Issues of the Plan

    Chairman Mao taught us: "When studying any process, if there are complex processes with more than two contradictions, we must do our best to find out its main contradiction." ("On Contradiction") Compiling a railway production and financial plan, like doing other work, must grasp the main contradiction, that is, the key issue. What is the main contradiction or key issue in the railway production and financial plan?

    The first is to achieve rational transportation. In order to achieve rational transportation, we must pay attention to transportation that saves national transportation capacity. How can we save transportation that saves national transportation capacity? We must pay attention to solving the problem of transportation that is prone to waste transportation capacity. Counter-flow transportation is the opposite transportation of the same or mutually replaceable goods. Therefore, counter-flow transportation will waste a lot of transportation capacity for the country. The railway must avoid this kind of transportation when carrying goods. Double transportation is the transportation of goods from other places, which are then loaded onto vehicles and transported to other places. Double transportation not only hinders the acceleration of vehicle turnover but also requires redundant loading and unloading operations and storage work, thereby increasing freight costs, which is unfavorable for both the railway and the cargo owner. Therefore, double transportation must be eliminated. Over-distance transportation is the transportation of materials from a relatively distant area instead of supplying the materials needed by the area from the nearby production area. This type of transportation not only prolongs the production cycle on the railway but also prevents materials, fuels, and semi-finished products from being used more quickly in the production process, thereby affecting the production speed of other national economic sectors.

    Short-distance transportation is the transportation of goods less than fifty kilometers. Eighty to ninety percent of the time for this type of transportation is wasted on operations such as loading and unloading, allocating vehicles, picking up vehicles, marshalling, and waiting for marshalling; therefore, the vehicle utilization efficiency of this type of transportation is eight to nine tenths lower than that of non-short-distance transportation. This type of transportation must be avoided when formulating plans. Railway transportation is busy in the first and fourth seasons, and leisurely in the second and third seasons; it is loose in the early part of the month, tight in the middle of the month, and rushed in the latter part of the month; it is loose in the first half of the day and tight in the second half of the day. Therefore, the railway must strive for the help of the government and state-owned economic sectors to strive for a balance in annual, seasonal, monthly, and daily transportation.

    The second is to increase the quantity of products and improve the quality of products. The products of the railway are passenger transportation and freight transportation. Freight transportation accounts for about 80% of all transportation; therefore, to increase the products of the railway, it is necessary to increase the quantity of freight transportation. However, passenger transportation cannot be relaxed while expanding freight transportation. However, when formulating plans, we cannot only pursue the quantity of products, we must also pay attention to the quality of products. If the railway completes the overall transportation task but fails to complete the transportation plan for major materials, this will affect the completion of the production plans of state-owned economic sectors and affect the supply of materials necessary for basic construction, national defense construction, and people's lives. Therefore, the railway should not only complete the state's overall transportation task but also complete the transportation plans for major materials such as coal, timber, grain, steel, ore, cement, and oil. Eliminating or reducing the percentage of difference between billed ton-kilometers and operating ton-kilometers is also a way to improve quality. The difference between billed ton-kilometers and operating ton-kilometers is the waste product in railway transportation products, which only increases railway expenses and does not increase any revenue. Therefore, when formulating plans, we must strive to reduce this product scrap rate to the minimum limit. Taking the 1952 production and financial plan of the China Changchun Railway as an example, if the percentage of difference between billed ton-kilometers and operating ton-kilometers increases by one compared with the plan, then the expenditure will increase by 9.18 billion yuan.

    Eliminating or reducing commercial accidents and ensuring safe driving are also issues that need to be paid attention to in improving quality.

    The third is to accelerate the production cycle. The production cycle of railway transportation is the vehicle turnaround time. Accelerating vehicle turnaround time is not only beneficial to railway transportation but also of great significance to the development of the entire national economy.

    For more than two years, under the enthusiastic help and active participation of Soviet experts, the China Changchun Railway has made great achievements in accelerating vehicle turnaround time. The vehicle turnaround time of the China Changchun Railway was 2.7 days before the establishment of the China Changchun Railway in 1950, while the plan for eight months in 1950 was 2.4 days, and the actual completion was 2.19 days; the plan for 1951 was 2.17 days, and the actual completion was 2.12 days; the plan for 1952 was 2.04 days, and the actual completion for nine months was 1.93 days.

    For more than two years, due to shortening the vehicle turnaround time, 9,478,272 vehicle hours have been saved. Calculated at 9,000 yuan per vehicle hour, a total of 85.3 billion yuan has been saved for the country; if the saved operating vehicles are put into production, the state's income can be increased by 312.8 billion yuan.

    The fourth is to improve labor productivity. Labor productivity is the most important and politically significant indicator in the enterprise production and financial plan. Under the guidance of Soviet experts, the China Changchun Railway carried out a series of technical organizational work and ideological education work in order to improve labor productivity. Therefore, significant achievements have been made in improving labor productivity. This can be fully seen from the fact that the number of operating staff has been decreasing year by year, labor productivity has been increasing year by year, and the product of converted ton-kilometers has been increasing year by year.

    If the actual completion of operating staff in the eight-month production and financial plan of the China Changchun Railway in 1950 is 100%, then the completion in 1951 is 92.8%; the plan for 1952 is 93%. Although the planned operating staff in 1952 is 7.2% less than the completed number in 1951, the production volume of converted ton-kilometers has increased by 16.1% compared with 1951, and labor productivity has increased by 25.2%; although the planned staff in 1952 is 7% less than the completed number in 1950, the production volume of converted ton-kilometers has increased by 48.6% compared with 1950, and labor productivity has increased by 59.8%. Labor productivity has increased by 59.8% in just over two years. This is the result of promoting advanced work methods, advanced production organization, and new technical operation procedures; this is the result of Soviet experts led by Comrades Yelogolov, Grunichev, and Vasilyev helping Chinese comrades to successfully overcome various conservative ideas; this is the result of advanced socialist enterprise management methods overwhelming backward capitalist enterprise management methods. In the first draft of the 1952 production and financial plan, the operating staff was originally determined to be 100, and the labor productivity was only 267.9 thousand converted ton-kilometers; but after further analysis of the situation and careful calculation by Soviet experts, especially after fighting against the conservative ideology of "more people make things easier," the revised plan staff was only 85, and labor productivity increased to 324.5 thousand converted ton-kilometers, thereby increasing by 21.1% compared with the first draft of the plan.

    Reducing staff, especially reducing administrative management staff, certainly plays a great role in improving labor productivity and saving management expenses; but Soviet experts do not only want Chinese comrades to pay attention to this aspect. While they tell Chinese comrades to use staff scientifically and rationally, they also promote Chinese comrades to actively find cargo sources, attract passengers, and strive to load more vehicles and transport more passengers to create another major condition for improving labor productivity.

    The fifth is to reduce product costs. Cost - this is the resultant indicator of the enterprise production and financial plan activities, and also the mirror that examines whether the enterprise management is good or bad. It can comprehensively and clearly reflect the work quality of the enterprise.

    The product cost of railway transportation, that is, the transportation cost of converted ton-kilometers, is the operating expenditure per converted ton-kilometer. The transportation cost of converted ton-kilometers is composed of wages, materials, fuel, electricity, and other items. In order to reduce transportation costs, we must do our best to increase the products on the railway - the transportation volume of converted ton-kilometers. Because every 1% increase in the transportation volume of converted ton-kilometers reduces the cost by 0.55% or saves 6.8 billion yuan in expenditure. Improving the utilization indicators of locomotives and vehicles is also an important factor in reducing costs. For example, as long as the heavy-duty dynamic load is increased by 1%, the transportation cost can be reduced by 0.16%, saving 1.8 billion yuan in expenditure. Improving labor productivity and practicing economy also play a significant role in reducing costs. Every 1% increase in labor productivity reduces the transportation cost by 0.4%, saving 4 billion yuan in expenditure. In 1951, the China Changchun Railway saved 98 billion yuan in material costs, reducing costs by 84%; in 1952, it is estimated to save 53 billion yuan in material costs, which can reduce costs by 4.8%.

    In addition, saving locomotive fuel and reducing non-productive expenses can also greatly reduce costs.

    In order to run the China Changchun Railway into a model railway with "low cost, high efficiency, and high profit," the Soviet experts not only often told Chinese comrades that they should pay attention to costs but also patiently taught Chinese comrades a scientific "cost analysis method," improved Chinese comrades' cost awareness, and enhanced Chinese comrades' economic accounting thinking.

    For more than two years, the wages of the China Changchun Railway have increased by 94.7%, and the price difference of materials and parts has almost doubled, but the transportation cost of the China Changchun Railway in 1952 has only increased by 3 yuan compared with 1950, that is, an increase of 5.2%. This shows that the labor wisdom of Chinese workers combined with the advanced experience of the Soviet Union can create brilliant achievements; it also shows that "leaning to one side" is necessary not only in politics but also in economic construction and enterprise management (including technical management).

    The sixth is to expand profits and increase accumulation.

    Our teachers, Comrades Sheretelkov, Milekov, and others, often enlightened us, saying: Enterprise profits are an important source for developing the economy, increasing the proportion of the socialist economy, and obtaining funds for industrial construction. There are two ways to expand profits: one is to increase revenue, and the other is to save expenditure. For more than two years, the China Changchun Railway has not only paid attention to large areas (passenger and freight revenue) in increasing revenue but also paid attention to small areas. For example, in terms of planned revenue, the China Changchun Railway has never relaxed its miscellaneous revenue. For example, lease contract revenue accounts for 0.67% of the China Changchun Railway's revenue; dedicated line revenue accounts for 0.4%; land lease accounts for 0.16%; rent for housing along the railway line accounts for 1.1%; rent for leased warehouses, shops, dining cars, canteens, etc. accounts for 0.11%; revenue from the health department accounts for 0.27%; revenue from telephone and telegraph accounts for 0.09%, etc. Because the China Changchun Railway truly calculated carefully and actively explored the potential of the enterprise, it accumulated a large amount of funds for the country. This can be seen from the increase in profits of the China Changchun Railway for more than two years: if the completed profit for eight months in 1950 is 100, then the completion in 1951 is 131, and the plan for 1952 is 176.2. The actual profit completed in the first half of 1952 was 296.6 billion yuan more than the completed amount for eight months in 1950. The achievement of this result is inseparable from the idea of Soviet experts that "don't just pay attention to the big ones, the big ones are integrated by the small ones." It is precisely because Soviet experts have such an idea that Chinese comrades' idea of "increasing revenue" and "expanding accumulation" has been enhanced, and the China Changchun Railway has been able to faithfully respond to Chairman Mao's great call of "increasing production, practicing economy" and "accumulating capital."

    Such large planned profits and excess profits have not only accumulated capital for the country but also improved the material and cultural life of employees. In 1951, the head fund allocated by the state to the China Changchun Railway for collective welfare undertakings, such as residential dormitories, reached 28.4 billion yuan; medical and health facilities and nurseries reached 11 billion yuan; cultural education and clubs reached 5.4 billion yuan; labor protection and technical safety 5.4 billion yuan; improvement of canteens, bathhouses, wells, etc. 9.6 billion yuan; bonuses and relief funds reached 12.5 billion yuan, so that workers truly saw and enjoyed the fruits of labor.

    IV. To Compile Plans, We Must Fight Against Incorrect Ideologies

    To make the enterprise plan a truly progressive and high-quality plan, we must learn from Soviet experts' strong national perspective and spirit of being serious, responsible, bold, careful, and realistic when dealing with problems in the process of compiling the plan, and wage an irreconcilable struggle against all incorrect ideologies.

    First of all, we must overcome the supply system mentality. Planners must stand firm, start from the overall situation, be conscientious and honest, and if the state needs to solve certain problems, such as investing in valuable equipment, then the state will solve them; if the state does not need to invest in solving them, or only needs a small subsidy, then we should ask for less and never ask for more, so that the state can invest its resources in places where they are urgently needed. Therefore, all ideas and practices of "preventing drought and preparing for famine" and "making broad plans and using them sparingly" are wrong. Secondly, the conservative ideology of being satisfied with the status quo and the adventurism of being eager for quick success and neglecting reality must be corrected. Adventurous plans that do not consider objective reality and rely solely on subjective illusions, making indicators deviate from reality, should certainly be opposed; but conservative plans that are afraid of not completing tasks, dare not move forward, and remain on outdated and old technical standards are even more harmful. Today, workers' ideological awareness has been improved, the patriotic labor production competition movement has been launched, labor organization has been improved, technical operation procedures have been shortened, work procedures have been improved, advanced experience has been gradually promoted, and the economic accounting system has been implemented, but people with conservative ideas do not analyze these extremely favorable conditions, do not face reality, do not deeply understand the situation, and do not pay attention to new things, so they are not good at appropriately improving various technical production operation indicators (such as vehicle turnaround time, travel speed, locomotive daily vehicle kilometers, average total weight of trains, static load, dynamic load, product production cycle of factories, etc.), so that they can promote production, increase revenue, reduce costs, expand accumulation, and achieve the purpose of expanded reproduction, but only stick to the rules and follow the rules. Plans compiled under this ideology will naturally not be able to organize all employees to fight for a common goal.

    Again, when compiling plans, we must also fight against localism. Localists only see the interests of their own units, do not see the overall interests and long-term interests of the working people, only seek their own convenience, regardless of the difficulties of others, and even undermine state policies in order to maintain the interests of small groups.

    A work style that is not careful in calculation, sloppy, and seeks to save trouble and is afraid of trouble is a stumbling block to planning work. Because the compilation of plans is not a dead list of numbers but a living action program of people, all sloppy, afraid of trouble, and trouble-saving practices are wrong.

    To overcome these ideas of supply system, conservatism, adventurism, localism, fear of trouble, and trouble-saving, and to fight against them, the most fundamental thing is to strengthen the study of Marxism-Leninism to improve the level of policy theory. Only when the level of policy theory is improved can we have a feeling for new things, can we implement new socialist enterprise management methods not only in words but also in action, can we use the Marxist-Leninist position, viewpoint, and method to correctly handle problems, can we understand and believe in the creativity of the masses, and resolutely rely on the masses to compile plans and implement plans.

    V. Supervision and Analysis of Plans

    Planning work is not completed when the plan is compiled and sent to the grass-roots business units. Planning work itself includes supervision and analysis of the implementation of the plan.

    Supervision and analysis of enterprise business activities can play a huge role in the enterprise completing and overfulfilling the plan, as well as in exploring potential and mobilizing potential.

    In the analysis process, not only should the overall business performance of the enterprise be checked, but also the work quality of each component department and each business unit of the enterprise should be studied to find out the specific reasons for the achievements and shortcomings. The degree of promotion and implementation of the economic accounting system in the workshop should also be analyzed, and measures should be taken to further consolidate the economic accounting system. Therefore, plan analysis is of great significance for improving the quality of enterprise products, improving labor productivity, reducing product costs, and strengthening the economic accounting system. From this, it can be seen that supervising and analyzing the implementation of the plan is an inseparable component of the entire planning work.

    We deeply realize that if we can conduct regular supervision and analysis of the plan, we can find shortcomings in time and improve our work. For example, due to the analysis of the 1951 second-quarter production and financial plan, it was found that some departments had not been assigned full personnel according to the planned staffing, but they had completed the task. Grasping this point, a detailed review of the personnel of each department was conducted, and it was found that 3,527 people could be transferred to new construction and major repair projects. For example, in the plan analysis of the first quarter of 1952, especially the second quarter, it was found that some branch bureaus and business departments did not exceed the planned expenditures, but exceeded the amount of work completed. Therefore, we understand that spending money without completing the amount of work is one of the reasons that hinder the completion of the annual plan. Therefore, in the analysis, if an overspending is found, the reason must be clarified to consolidate the discipline of planning and finance and ensure the completion of the plan.

    The China Changchun Railway must review the completion of the state-approved plan on an annual and quarterly basis. During the review, the branch bureau will form a review committee composed of the branch bureau chief, the heads of various sections, social organizations, and advanced workers to review the completion of the plan at the station and section; the management bureau will form a review committee composed of the bureau chief and the heads of various departments to review the completion of the plan at the branch bureau. This approach not only ensures the completion of the quarterly and annual production and financial plans but also establishes the Chinese comrades' idea that the state-approved plan must be completed unconditionally.

    The importance of supervision and analysis also lies in making appropriate revisions to the plan when necessary. Any plan, no matter how subjectively good in quality and practical, is difficult to make perfect due to the limitation of materials and the lack of good analysis. It is impossible to consider all potential forces and all possibilities. These potential forces and possibilities can only be gradually discovered in the process of implementing the plan. Only by being good at using these potential forces and possibilities and making appropriate revisions to the plan can the plan be more accurate and practical. The great Stalin taught in his report to the Sixteenth Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks): "Only bureaucracy can imagine that planning work ends with the compilation of the plan. The formulation of the plan is only the beginning of planning work. Real planning leadership can only be developed after the plan is formulated, after on-site inspection, and in the process of implementing and revising the plan."

    The China Changchun Railway is precisely in accordance with Stalin's instructions that it has compiled a quarterly revised plan to maintain the plan's reality and advancement. In the full-load, over-axle, and 500-kilometer movement, the old standards and old quotas have been broken. If the plan is not revised in time, the plan will not only lag behind reality and fail to play a role in promoting production but will also become an obstacle to the in-depth development of the movement. It must be pointed out that the analysis of the plan is not to passively reveal shortcomings but to actively propose measures to improve shortcomings. When formulating measures to overcome shortcomings, planners should take the initiative to consult with workers, engineering and technical personnel, and relevant business personnel to "gather ideas and prescribe the right medicine." When analyzing, attention should also be paid to grasping the main contradiction, that is, the key issue (indicator), because conducting detailed analysis of the completion of all indicators will inevitably divert energy. However, deeply analyzing certain key indicators can solve other problems.

    生产财务计划——企业的行动纲领
    ——中国长春铁路先进经验介绍之一
    中国长春铁路管理局计划处副处长  尹子家
    一、企业计划必须体现党和国家的政策
    在苏联专家热心指导和积极参加之下，中长铁路完成了一九五○、一九五一、一九五二年的计划编制工作；完成了一九五○、一九五一年的年度与季度分析，并编制了一九五一年第四季、一九五二年三、四各季的季度修正计划。目前正赶编一九五三年计划中。三年来我们在计划工作中，深深体验到：一个国营企业，如果没有一个“从群众中来，到群众中去”的质量好的生产财务计划，作为企业全体职工的行动纲领，要想把企业管理好，是不可想像的。
    企业计划是国家统一的经济计划的组成部分，而国家统一的经济计划是国家在一定时期内政治经济任务的体现。计划工作者应当以向人民、党和国家高度负责的态度和实事求是的精神，来制订计划，争取计划的质量高，符合政策。为此，就应当从推行先进的生产技术作业过程，先进的劳动组织和劳动定额，先进的原材料、燃料、电力等的消耗定额的观点出发；就应当最大限度地安全地规定机器设备的利用率，以达到企业潜在力的发挥，设备利用率的提高，劳动生产率的增加，产品成本的降低，企业利润的扩大，国家积累的增多以及职工物质生活和文化生活的改善，安全生产方针得到贯彻的目的。
    中长铁路的计划不但贯彻“增加生产、厉行节约”、“积累资本”的政策，而且更重视安全生产。苏联专家常告诉中国同志说：“人是最宝贵的财产。”在苏联专家这一崇高思想指导之下，生产财务计划就规定了一定数量的劳动保护、技术安全和作业服装的经费。如：一九五一年为八十九亿元；一九五二年为一百零二亿元。不使用或少使用这笔经费和其他开支，要受到严厉批评，而且可以例外地准许季度间相互使用这笔经费。
    中长铁路生产财务计划体现党和国家的政策，也表现在培养干部方面。一九五一年计划中共规定此项经费为六十七亿元；一九五二年为一百一十八亿元。在苏联专家的积极组织、推动和真诚帮助下，三年来培养了上万名新生的干部。
    二、铁路运输计划和国家其他经济部门的关系
    既然铁路运输计划是国民经济计划的组成部分，它就应该和其他国营企业密切配合，必须把运输计划和工业生产计划、农业生产计划、商品流动计划、国家贸易计划等，紧密地结合起来。因此，铁路必须在合理运输的基础上，尽量发挥运输效能，为国家各经济部门、各厂矿服务；而国家各经济部门、各厂矿亦必须遵照国家统一的经济计划提出合理的托运计划，并尽可能地保证按时准备好货物。只有铁路和国家各经济部门、各厂矿间有节奏地配合起来，才能保证国家运输计划的完成，才能保证国家其他经济部门生产计划的完成，从而才能保证国家统一的经济计划的完成。中长铁路一九五一年计划运输占总运输量百分之七十二，一九五二年一、二、三各季占百分之六十八。
    为了完成国家统一的经济计划，各大国营经济部门按计划托运是有极大意义的。中长铁路一九五一年和一九五二年九个月中，如果没有苏联专家坚持国家批准的计划必须无条件完成的决心，那么中长铁路一九五一年和一九五二年九个月的运输计划是很难完成的。一九五一年全年计划外运输占百分之二十八，一九五二年九个月的计划外运输占百分之三十二。问题很清楚：没有苏联专家坚决地主张寻找货源，一九五一年的百分之二十八和一九五二年九个月的百分之三十二的货物是不能运输的。这不但影响中长铁路完不成国家给的任务，同时也将影响各国营企业完不成它们的生产计划。这将对国家有多大损失呢？为保证完成国家统一的经济计划，铁路必须在党和政府的帮助下，争取和国营经济部门订立运输合同，用这种合同形式把运输计划巩固起来，使国家运输尽速走向计划化，克服盲目现象，减少几千辆货车在专用线上的非生产停留的时间。
    三、抓住计划的关键问题
    毛主席教导我们说：“研究任何过程，如果是存在着两个以上矛盾的复杂过程的话，就要用全力找出它的主要矛盾。”（“矛盾论”）编制铁路生产财务计划，如同搞其他工作一样，必须抓住主要的矛盾，即关键问题。铁路生产财务计划中的主要矛盾或主要关键问题是什么呢？
    第一是实现合理运输。为要实现合理运输，就必须注意节省国家运输力的运输。怎样节省国家运输力的运输呢？就必须注意解决那种易于浪费运输力的运输的问题。对流运输是同种或可以互相顶替的货物的相向运输。因之对流运输会给国家浪费很大的运输力。铁路在承运货物时，必须避免这种运输。二重运输是货物由外地运来，又装车运往别地的运输。二重运输不仅妨碍车辆加速周转，而且要进行多余的装卸作业和保管工作，因而增多运费，这对于铁路和货主都不利。所以必须消灭二重运输。过远运输是不从附近生产地区供给需要地区物资，而从较远地区去运的那种运输。这种运输不仅延长铁路上的生产周期，而且使材料、燃料及半成品不能更快地使用在生产过程中，从而影响其他国民经济部门的生产速度。
    短途运输是货物运输不到五十公里的那种运输。这种运输百分之八、九十的时间全浪费在装卸、配车、取车、编组、待编等作业上；因之这种运输的车辆运用效率比非短途运输要低十分之八、九。在订计划时，必须避免这种运输。铁路运输在一、四季繁忙，二、三季清闲；在每月初旬松，中旬紧，下旬赶；在每天上半夜松，下半夜紧。因此，铁路必须争取政府和国营经济部门的帮助，争取年、季、月、日运输的平衡。
    第二是增大产品数量，提高产品质量。铁路的产品，是客运和货运。货运约占全部运输百分之八十左右；因此要增加铁路的产品，就必须增加货运数量。但在扩大货运的同时，对客运也不能放松。但编制计划时，不能只追求产品的数量，必须同时注意产品的质量。如果铁路虽完成了总的运输任务，但没有完成主要物资的运输计划，那么这就要影响国营经济部门生产计划的完成，就要影响基本建设、国防建设和人民生活必需物资的供应。因此铁路不但应该完成国家总的运输任务，而且更应该完成煤炭、木材、粮谷、钢铁、矿石、洋灰、石油等主要物资的运输计划。消灭或缩小计费吨公里和运营吨公里的差数的百分比，也是提高质量的方法。计费吨公里和运营吨公里的差数，就是铁路运输产品中的废品，只增加铁路开支，不增加任何收入。因此，编制计划时，必须努力缩小这一产品废品率到最小的限度。以中长铁路一九五二年生产财务计划为例，如果计费吨公里和运营吨公里的差数百分比，较计划增加一，那么就要增加支出九十一亿八千万元。
    消灭或减少商务事故，保证行车安全，也是提高质量所要注意的问题。
    第三是加速生产周期。铁路运输的生产周期，就是车辆周转时间。加速车辆周转时间，不仅对铁路运输有好处，而且对整个国民经济的发展也有重大的意义。
    二年多来，中长铁路在苏联专家热诚帮助和积极参加之下，加速车辆周转时间，是有很大成绩的。中长铁路的车辆周转时间在一九五○年中长铁路成立前是二点七天，而一九五○年八个月计划为二点四天，实际完成是二点一九天；一九五一年计划为二点一七天，实际完成是二点一二天；一九五二年计划为二点○四天，九个月实际完成一点九三天。
    二年多来，由于缩短车辆周转时间，节省了九百四十七万八千二百七十二个车小时，每个车小时按九千元计算，共给国家节省八百五十三亿元；如将节省运用车投入生产，可给国家增加收入三千一百二十八亿元。
    第四是提高劳动生产率。劳动生产率是企业生产财务计划中最重要的和有政治意义的指标。中长铁路在苏联专家的指导下，为了提高劳动生产率，进行了一系列的技术组织工作和思想教育工作。所以在提高劳动生产率方面，有了显著的成绩。这从运营工作人员逐年减少、劳动生产率逐年提高、换算吨公里产品逐年增加的事实中，完全可以看到。
    以中长铁路一九五○年八个月生产财务计划实际完成运营人员为百分之一百，则一九五一年完成为百分之九十二点八；一九五二年计划为百分之九十三，一九五二年计划运营人员虽较一九五一年完成的减少百分之七点二，但换算吨公里生产量却比一九五一年增加百分之十六点一，劳动生产率提高百分之二十五点二；一九五二年计划人员虽较一九五○年完成的减少百分之七，但换算吨公里生产量却比一九五○年增加百分之四十八点六，劳动生产率提高百分之五十九点八。仅在两年多过程中，劳动生产率就提高了百分之五十九点八。这是推广先进工作方法、先进生产组织和新的技术作业过程的结果；这是以叶洛果夫、格鲁尼切夫、瓦西列夫诸同志为首的苏联专家们帮助中国同志胜利地克服了各种保守思想的结果；这是先进的社会主义的企业经营方法压倒了落后的资本主义的企业管理方法的结果。在一九五二年第一次生产财务计划草案中的运营人员原确定为一○○，劳动生产率仅为二百六十七点九千换算吨公里；但经过苏联专家进一步分析情况，精打细算，特别是和“人多好办事”的保守主义思想进行斗争之后，修正计划人员仅为八十五，劳动生产率提高到三百二十四点五千换算吨公里，因而比第一次计划草案增加百分之二十一点一。
    精减人员，特别是精减行政管理人员，对提高劳动生产率和节约管理经费固然有很大作用；但苏联专家并不仅仅要中国同志注意这一方面，他们告诉中国同志科学合理地使用人员的同时，更推动中国同志积极寻找货源，招揽旅客，争取多装车，多运旅客，以创造另一提高劳动生产率的主要条件。
    第五是降低产品成本。成本——这是企业生产财务计划活动的结果性的指标，也是检验企业管理好坏的镜子，它能全面地、鲜明地反映企业的工作质量。
    铁路运输的产品成本，即换算吨公里运输成本，是投入每换算吨公里的运营支出。换算吨公里运输成本是由工资、材料、燃料、电力等项构成的。为要降低运输成本，就必须尽最大努力增加铁路上的产品——换算吨公里运输量。因为换算吨公里运输量每增加百分之一，成本即降低百分之○点五五，或节省支出六十八亿元。提高机车、车辆的运用指标，也是降低成本的重要因素。比如只要提高重车动载重百分之一，就可降低运输成本百分之零点一六，节省支出十八亿元。提高劳动生产率和厉行节约，对于降低成本，也有重大作用。提高劳动生产率百分之一，就降低运输成本百分之零点四，节省支出四十亿元。一九五一年中长铁路节省材料费九百八十亿元，降低成本百分之八十四；一九五二年计节省材料费五百三十亿元，可降低成本百分之四点八。
    此外，节省机车燃料，减少非生产开支，也能大大降低成本。
    中长铁路苏联专家为了把中长铁路办成“成本低，效率高，利润多”的模范铁路，不仅经常告诉中国同志应重视成本，并且耐心地教会了中国同志一套科学的“成本分析方法”，提高了中国同志的成本观念，也增强了中国同志的经济核算思想。
    二年多来，中长铁路的工资提高百分之九十四点七，材料和零件的差价差不多增加一倍多，但是一九五二年中长铁路运输成本仅比一九五○年提高三元，即提高百分之五点二。这说明了中国职工的劳动智慧一与苏联先进经验结合，就能创造出辉煌成绩；也说明了不仅在政治上而且在经济建设和企业管理（包括技术管理）上都必须“一边倒”。
    第六是扩大利润，增加积累。
    我们的老师——谢里捷尔果夫、米列克夫等同志，常常启发我们说：企业利润，是发展经济、增加社会主义经济比重，取得工业建设资金的重要来源。扩大利润有两个方法：一个是增加收入，一个是节约支出。二年多来中长铁路在增加收入上，不仅注意大地方（客运、货运收入），而且还注意了小地方。如在计划收入方面，中长铁路对铁路的杂收入，始终未放松。例如：租借合同收入在中长铁路收入中占百分之零点六七；专用线收入占百分之零点四；出租地段占百分之零点一六；铁路沿线用地住宅等租费占百分之一点一；出租仓库、卖店、餐车、食堂等占百分之零点一一；卫生部门收入占百分之零点二七；电话、电报收入占百分之零点零九等等。由于中长铁路真正地精打细算，积极地发掘企业潜在力量，才给国家积累了大量资金。这从二年多来中长铁路利润增加的情况可以看出：如以一九五○年八个月完成利润为一○○，则一九五一年完成为一三一，一九五二年计划则为一七六点二。一九五二年上半年实际完成利润较一九五○年八个月完成数，还多二千九百六十六亿元。这个成绩的获得，是和苏联专家“别光注意大的，大的是由小的集成的”的思想分不开的。正因为苏联专家有着这样的思想，才增强了中国同志“增加收入”“扩大积累”的思想，才使中长铁路能够忠实地响应了毛主席“增加生产，厉行节约”“积累资本”的伟大号召。
    这样大的计划利润和超额利润，不仅为国家积累了资本，而且改善了职工物质文化生活。一九五一年国家拨给中长铁路的首长基金用于集体福利事业的，如住宅宿舍达二百八十四亿元；医疗卫生设施和托儿所达一百一十亿元；文化教育和俱乐部达五十四亿元；劳动保护和技术安全五十四亿元；改善食堂、浴池、水井等九十六亿元；奖金和救济费达一百二十五亿元，使工人真正看到并享受到了劳动的果实。
    四、编制计划，必须向不正确思想作斗争
    要使企业计划真正成为进步的有质量的计划，就必须在编制计划过程中，学习苏联专家那样强烈的国家观点和处理问题时的认真负责、大胆细心、实事求是的精神，向一切不正确的思想，作不调和的斗争。
    首先，要克服供给制思想。计划工作者，务必站稳立场，从整体出发、兢兢业业、老老实实，一定需要国家解决的，即由国家解决，如投资贵重器材等；不需要国家投资解决，或少许贴补即可，就应少要，绝不多要，以便国家把力量投到迫切需要的地方去。因此，一切“防旱备荒”“宽打窄用”的思想和作法，都是错误的。其次，满足于现实的保守思想和好大喜功的冒险主义，是必须纠正的。不考虑客观现实，单凭主观空想，使指标脱离实际的冒险计划，固然应当反对；但怕完不成任务，不敢前进，停留在过时的、陈旧的技术标准上的保守计划，为害更深。今天工人思想觉悟提高了，爱国主义劳动生产竞赛运动搞起来了，劳动组织改善了，技术作业过程缩短了，工作程序改进了，先进经验逐渐推广了，经济核算制实行了，但有保守思想的人们，却不分析这些极端有利的条件，不面对现实，不深入了解情况，不重视新鲜事物，从而也就不善于把各种技术生产作业指标（如车辆周转时间、旅行速度、机车日车公里、列车平均总重、静载重、动载重、工厂的产品生产周期等）予以恰当提高，使其推动生产，增加收入，降低成本，扩大积累，以达到扩大再生产的目的，只是墨守成规，照章办事。在这种思想下编制的计划，自然不可能把全体职工组织起来，为一个共同目标斗争。
    再次，在编制计划时，也要和本位思想作斗争。本位主义者只看到本单位的利益，看不见劳动人民的整体利益和长远利益，只图自己方便，不管他人困难，甚至为了维护小集团的利益，而破坏国家政策。
    不精打细算，粗枝大叶，图省事、怕麻烦的工作作风，是计划工作的绊脚石。因为计划的编制并不是死的数字的罗列，而是活生生的人的行动纲领，所以一切粗枝大叶、怕麻烦、图省事的作法，都是错误的。
    欲克服这些供给制、保守、冒险、本位、怕麻烦、图省事等思想，并向其作斗争，最基本的是加强对马克思列宁主义的学习，以提高政策理论水平，只有政策理论水平提高了，才能对新鲜事物有感觉，才能不但在口头上而且在行动上贯彻新的社会主义的企业经营管理方法，才能运用马克思列宁主义的立场、观点、方法、正确地处理问题，才能领会并相信群众的创造性，坚决依靠群众来编制计划和贯彻计划。
    五、计划的监察和分析
    计划工作，不是将计划编制完了，发到基层业务单位就算完结。计划工作本身，包含对计划执行情况的监察和分析。
    企业业务活动的监察和分析，对企业完成和超额完成计划，以及对发掘潜力和动员潜力上，能起巨大作用。
    在分析过程中，不仅检查企业总的业务活动成绩，也应研究企业各个组成部门各个业务单位的工作质量，找出成绩和缺点的具体原因。对车间经济核算制的推行和贯彻程度，亦应进行分析，并做出进一步巩固经济核算制的措施。所以计划分析，对企业产品质量的改进，劳动生产率的提高，产品成本的降低，以及经济核算制的加强等，有重大意义。由此可见，对计划执行情况进行监察和分析，乃是全部计划工作不可分离的组成部分。
    我们深深地体验到：如果对计划能进行经常的监察和分析，就可及时发现缺点，改进工作。比如：由于对一九五一年第二季生产财务计划进行分析，发现有些部门并未按计划定员配齐，但也完成了任务。抓住这点，对各部门人员进行了详细的审查，发现可以把三千五百二十七人，转移到新建及大修工程方面去。又如：在一九五二年第一季，特别是第二季计划分析中，发现有的分局和业务部门，按照计划规定的支出并未超过，但按完成工作量则超过了。因此我们了解不按完成的工作量而花钱，是妨碍年度计划完成的原因之一。因此，在分析中，如发现超支，必须弄清原因，以巩固计划财务纪律，保证计划的完成。
    中长铁路对国家批准的计划的完成情况，都要按年按季加以审查。在审查时，分局由分局长、各科长会同社会团体、先进工人，组成审查委员会，到站、段审查计划完成情况；管理局由局长、各处长组成审查委员会，到分局审查计划完成情况。这样作法，不仅保证了季、年生产财务计划的完成，而且树立了中国同志对国家批准的计划必须无条件完成的思想。
    监察和分析的重要还在于：必要时将计划作适当的修正。任何计划，不管主观上如何要求质量好，切合实际，但由于材料所限，不善于分析，很难使计划尽善尽美，不可能把一切潜在力量和一切可能性皆考虑到。这些潜在力量和可能性，只有在执行计划过程中才能逐渐发现出来。只有善于利用这些潜在力量和可能性，并将计划作适当修正，才能使计划更加确切、实际。伟大的斯大林在联共（布）第十六次代表大会的报告中，教导说：“只有官僚主义才能想像计划工作随着计划的编制而告终。计划的制订，仅仅是计划工作的开始，真正的计划领导，只有在计划制订以后，经过实地检查以后，在计划的实施和修正过程中，才能展开。”
    中长铁路正是按照斯大林的指示，编造了季度修正计划，以保持计划的现实性、先进性。在满载、超轴、五百公里运动中，打破了旧的标准、旧的定额，如不及时修正计划，则计划不但要落后于现实，起不了推动生产的作用，更将成为运动深入发展的障碍。必须指出：计划的分析不是消极地揭露缺点，而是积极地提出改进缺点的措施。在制订克服缺点措施时，计划工作者应主动地和工人、工程技术人员及有关业务人员商量，以便“集思广益，对症下药。”在分析时，还应注意抓住主要的矛盾、即关键问题（指标），因为对一切指标的完成，都进行详细的分析，势必分散精力。但深刻地分析某些关键性指标，其他问题就可跟着解决了。
