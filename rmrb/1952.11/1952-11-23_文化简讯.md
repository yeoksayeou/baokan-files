Introduction to the Contents of the Combined October-November Issue of "Script" Monthly

The combined October-November issue of "Script" monthly is entirely dedicated to publishing six scripts that were performed at the First National Opera Observation and Performance Conference: Shanghai Opera "Luohan Money" is adapted from Comrade Zhao Shuli's novel "Registration." This script depicts the similar experiences and different outcomes of a mother and daughter on the issue of marriage, praising the victory of women in the new society in their struggle against the unreasonable marriage system. It is one of the outstanding modern dramas performed at this Observation and Performance Conference. Yue Opera "The Tale of the White Snake" is one of the beautiful folk legends circulating in our country, and it is also one of the dramas with strong popular character in Chinese opera. Chu Opera "Ge Ma," Hunan Flower Drum Opera "Liu Hai Cutting Firewood," Sichuan Opera "Five Platforms Reunion" and "Autumn River" are all excellent traditional dramas after revision. "Ge Ma" is a satirical comedy that vividly depicts the character of Ge Ma, demonstrating the wisdom and kindness of the working people. "Liu Hai Cutting Firewood" praises the joy of labor and healthy love through a beautiful fairy tale. "Autumn River" is a healthy and life-filled little comedy depicting an enthusiastic and pure young nun and a humorous old boatman. The short play "Five Platforms Reunion" depicts the story of the patriotic hero Yang family in the Song Dynasty, vividly and realistically portraying the characters of the heroes.
