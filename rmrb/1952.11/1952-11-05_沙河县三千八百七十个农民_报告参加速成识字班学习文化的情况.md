Shahe County's 3,870 Farmers
Report on Their Cultural Studies in the Quick Literacy Class

Respected Chairman Mao: We are 3,870 farmers from Shahe County. We are pleased to report to you that in the past three years, under your leadership, we have not only turned ourselves over politically, greatly improved our production and living standards, but also turned ourselves over culturally.

Comrade Qi Jianhua created the quick literacy method, which opened the door to culture for us. In May, our county held a key experimental quick literacy class. After gaining experience, we successively opened 151 quick literacy classes in 109 villages throughout the county. A total of 3,870 male and female farmers participated in the quick literacy learning. After more than three months of study, we have learned more than 2,000 characters, can read popular books and newspapers, and can write simple letters. Among us, there is Liu Qinghua, nicknamed "Old First Grade." He used to attend a private school for a year and a half and never learned many characters. Now he has graduated from the quick literacy class and can read popular books and newspapers. Chen Yunjing from Gaozhuang Village is 44 years old this year. When she asked to participate in the study, many people were afraid that she was too old to learn. However, she learned more than 1,600 characters in just 42 hours. Many of us had never known a single character for generations, but now we have shed the label of illiteracy and are no longer blind. Recently, many villages have established cultural clubs and bought many popular books and newspapers for us to consolidate our learning achievements. We have also established reading groups, run blackboard newspapers, and carried out cultural and recreational activities. The atmosphere in the village has been completely renewed.

The new China has brought us a new life. We understand that without the great and correct Communist Party, without the wise Chairman Mao, there would be no prosperous and strong new China, and we would not have such a happy and joyful life. All of us trainees solemnly assure you that we will continue to study hard, improve our cultural level, political level, and production technology, actively organize ourselves, develop production, and build our motherland into a better place.

    沙河县三千八百七十个农民
    报告参加速成识字班学习文化的情况
    敬爱的毛主席：我们是沙河县三千八百七十个农民。我们愉快地向您报告：三年来，在您的领导下，我们不但在政治上翻了身，生产和生活大大提高了，并且还在文化上翻了身。
    祁建华同志创造了速成识字法，给我们打开了文化的大门。我县在五月间举办了速成识字重点实验班，取得经验后，接着就在全县一百零九个村庄先后开办了一百五十一个速成识字班。我们三千八百七十个男女农民参加了速成识字学习。经过三个多月的学习，我们已经认会了两千多字，能看通俗书报，会写简单书信了。我们中间有一个外号叫“老一册”的刘清华，他过去上了一年半民校，一直没有认识多少字；现在他已经从速成识字班毕了业，能够读通俗书报了。高庄村的陈云景今年四十四岁了，当她要求参加学习时，很多人怕她年岁大学不成，可是她仅仅用了四十二小时，就学会了一千六百多个字。我们中间有很多人是几辈子一个字也不识的，现在都摘掉了文盲帽子，再也不当睁眼瞎子了。最近很多村子已经成立了文化俱乐部，买了不少通俗书报，让我们巩固学习成果。我们还成立了读报小组，办了黑板报，开展了文化娱乐活动。村子里的气象焕然一新了。
    新中国给我们带来了新的生活。我们懂得，没有伟大正确的共产党，没有英明的毛主席，就没有繁荣富强的新中国，我们也就没有这样幸福愉快的好光景。我们全体学员向您庄严地保证：我们要继续努力学习，提高文化水平、政治水平和生产技术，积极组织起来，发展生产，把祖国建设得更美好。
    河北省沙河县速成识字班三千八百七十个学员
