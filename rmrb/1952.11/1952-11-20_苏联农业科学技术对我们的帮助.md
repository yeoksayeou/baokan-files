    How Soviet Agricultural Science and Technology Helps Us
    To the Editor: I am an agricultural scientist. In the past few years, under the guidance of the advanced Soviet agricultural science and technology, I have gradually freed myself from the shackles of the bourgeois, idealist Morgan's theory and achieved significant results in wheat cultivation.

    In the old society, I was deeply poisoned by the idealist Morgan's theory. In 1949, although I read some books on the Michurin doctrine, I believed that it was not a complete theory; while Morgan's theory was a "complete" and "systematic" theory. Under the domination of this thought, I caused great losses to my work.

    In February 1951, the Heilongjiang Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry convened a provincial conference of scientific workers' representatives. The responsible comrades of the Department of Agriculture and Forestry emphasized the advanced Soviet experience in agricultural science and criticized the bourgeois viewpoint of experimenting for the sake of experimentation. After the meeting, our director, Comrade Kan Wei, gave me many examples of the advanced Soviet experience in creating various high yields, which initially broke my conservative ideas and began to realize the correctness of William's famous saying, "There is no bad land, only bad masters." Last year, our farm, combined with the advanced Soviet experience, brought into play the characteristics of the land and conducted high-yield cultivation experiments on millet and soybeans. As a result, each hectare of millet yielded 9,635 catties, and each hectare of soybeans yielded 6,517 catties. Educated by such a vivid example, I jumped out of the circle of Morgan's conservative thinking and broke the fallacy of "breeding is omnipotent."

    This year, all cadres and workers of our farm further studied the advanced Soviet experience and applied comprehensive techniques such as deep plowing, early plowing, vernalization, drought prevention and moisture conservation, increasing the application of base fertilizer, topdressing, mastering irrigation, and preventing pests and diseases. As a result, one hectare of wheat reached a high yield of 7,381 catties.

    Thinking of this, I deeply realize that the advanced Soviet experience and the materialist scientific theories of Michurin and Lysenko are absolutely true. Under the education and wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, advancing along the Soviet scientific path, our future is limitless!

    苏联农业科学技术对我们的帮助
    编辑同志：我是一个农业科学工作者。几年来，在苏联的先进农业科学技术指导下，我逐渐摆脱了资产阶级的唯心摩尔根学理的束缚，在小麦栽培上获得了显著的成绩。
    我在旧社会里受唯心的摩尔根主义的毒素很深。一九四九年我虽看了一些有关米丘林学说的书籍，但却认为它不是完整的学说；而摩尔根学理是“完整”的有“系统”的学说。在这种思想支配下，我给工作造成了很大的损失。
    一九五一年二月，黑龙江省农林厅召开了全省科学工作者代表会，农林厅负责同志在会上着重介绍了苏联在农业科学上的先进经验，批判了为试验而试验的资产阶级观点。会后，我们的场长阚巍同志又给我举了很多苏联创各种高额产量的先进经验的实例，这才初步打破了我的保守思想，开始了解到威廉氏所说的“没有不良的土地，只有不良的主人”这句名言的正确性。去年，我场结合苏联的先进经验，发挥了土地的特点，作了谷子、大豆丰产栽培试验，结果每垧谷子打了九千六百三十五斤，每垧大豆打了六千五百一十七斤。我在这样一个生动的实例教育下，跳出了摩尔根主义保守思想的圈子，打破了“育种万能”的谬论。
    今年我场全体干部、工友进一步学习了苏联先进经验，运用了综合性技术，如深耕、早耕、春化处理、防旱保墒、增施基肥、追肥、掌握灌水、防止病虫害等。结果，一垧小麦达到了七千三百八十一斤的高额产量。
    想到这，我深深地体会到苏联的先进经验，米丘林和李森科的唯物科学理论的千真万确。在中国共产党和毛主席的教育和英明领导下，循着苏联的科学道路前进，我们的前途是无可限量的！
