    A Factory Restored Under the Direct Guidance of Soviet Experts
    Meng Lang
    This is a smelting factory in the Northeast that had never been able to produce anything since its establishment during the puppet Manchukuo period. Despite the best efforts of the Japanese imperialists to plunder more wealth from here, their hopes were dashed due to unresolved technical problems.
    After the "September 3rd" victory, the factory suffered severe damage from the Kuomintang bandits and was completely paralyzed. When we first saw it after liberation, the chimneys and rooftops were covered in crow droppings, crow nests were everywhere, the machinery was in a chaotic state, covered in a layer of dust at least two inches thick. In some parts of the yard, weeds grew taller than a person, with the corpses of lynx and wild foxes lying inside.... The desolate state of the factory stunned the technical personnel sent by the People's Government. They investigated and studied for more than two months and came to the conclusion: "Insufficient equipment, problematic materials, no technical personnel, and it takes at least three years to train a worker... It cannot be repaired within three years, and even if it is repaired, it will not be able to produce anything!"
    "Is it really impossible to repair, and even if it is repaired, it won't be able to produce anything?" As the factory's leading cadres were racking their brains without finding an answer, the Soviet experts sent by Comrade Stalin arrived in China.
    The Soviet expert who came to this factory was Comrade Kranchenko. He was a smelting expert from a working-class background, and even at forty-eight years old, he was still so lively and enthusiastic. After arriving at the factory, he ran up and down, thoroughly investigating and studying for seven days, and finally came to a conclusion, but this conclusion was: "It can be restored in the shortest time, and new products can definitely be produced!" This conclusion shocked the original two technical personnel. They thought to themselves, "This factory is entirely American-style equipment, and the Japanese tried and failed for many years. Now, without equipment or technology, how can it be restored?"
    There were many ideological obstacles to accepting the Soviet expert's opinion. What to do? The leadership decided to have the experts and Chinese technical personnel study together. At the meeting, the Soviet expert said: "I am carrying out Comrade Stalin's order to help our best friends with construction, and I must fulfill my mission!" Regarding whether it could be restored and produce new products, Comrade Kranchenko said: "Now the Chinese people have become the masters of their country. They want to build their own factories. Although there are many difficulties, I believe that all difficulties can be overcome... In our country, there is a saying: 'Those who ruin good things are trash and fools; those who make bad things good are heroes!' I believe that many heroes will emerge among Chinese workers in the construction of the motherland!"
    This meeting played a significant educational role for some young technical personnel. Some said, "The Soviet expert is right. In order to build our motherland, we must overcome all difficulties!" Others said, "We must learn technology well from the Soviet experts and build our country well." More importantly, the leadership's ideology became firm, and they decided to immediately start the restoration and reconstruction work. At this time, there were no workers in the factory. Comrade Kranchenko said, "As long as there are people, people can create everything." So the factory found seven old workers who had worked in the factory before, and they went to the countryside to recruit more than 140 emancipated farmers (who later became excellent technical workers), and the team was complete.
    Before starting work, Comrade Kranchenko specially called the young technicians to his office. He took out a calendar and flipped through it, stopping at July 1st, and asked everyone, "What day is this?" Everyone replied, "It is the birthday of our Chinese Communist Party!" "That's right! The Chinese Communist Party is the great savior of the Chinese people. To celebrate its birthday, our new products must be test-produced by 'July 1st'!" Everyone was shocked. The day was February 2nd, and there were less than five months until "July 1st." It would be so difficult to restore and rebuild a factory and produce new products in such a short time!
    At this time, Comrade Kranchenko made a plan. He felt that from restoration and reconstruction to test-producing products, three key issues should be grasped:
    One was the brick problem: take them from the old furnace, grind them, and reuse them. One was the problem of brick ash and adhesive: in the past, they all had to be bought from foreign countries, but now they had to be manufactured themselves. One was the problem of operating technology: first repair the experimental furnace, and after successful test production, then repair the large furnace for formal production. He thought: These problems must be solved "locally," without relying on foreign aid. In order to do these three tasks well, workers and technicians must skillfully master advanced smelting technology.
    The first step in the restoration and reconstruction work began. The newly arrived peasant-born workers, led by the old workers, began to dismantle the furnace. Comrade Kranchenko personally went to the site every day to inspect the work. Seeing that the workers did not know how to dismantle the bricks, he taught them hand-in-hand, and told the workers, "Don't break the bricks, we will use them to repair the new furnace. This kind of brick is very expensive, one brick can buy a cart of grain...." So the workers were very careful when dismantling the bricks, and eighty to ninety percent of the dismantled bricks were intact. He also asked the technicians to pay attention to finding the reasons for the Japanese devils' technical failures during the dismantling of the furnace. The technicians drew diagrams and took pictures of the cracks in the furnace, and studied the situation of each device, and found a total of seventeen unreasonable places, such as not leaving expansion gaps in the furnace, which resulted in the steel plate of the upper section of the furnace being pushed up, and the furnace wall also being cracked, etc., which prepared the conditions for establishing operating procedures for restoration and reconstruction in the future.
    The furnace dismantling project was successfully completed. The second step was to manufacture brick ash and other materials. Brick ash is a very expensive thing. At that time, the entire factory only had one box of brick ash, so brick ash was the biggest problem at that time. Without it, even if the bricks were ground, the furnace could not be repaired!
    In fact, brick ash is very simple, just grind the bricks into powder, the problem is how to make the adhesive. Comrade Kranchenko had foreseen this. While having everyone dismantle the furnace, he sent technician Comrade Gu Limin to do the experiment of brick ash adhesive. Before the experiment of the adhesive, Comrade Kranchenko pointed out that water glass could be used to mix brick ash, and stipulated a certain ratio. However, after Gu Limin received this task, he did not do it himself, but only assigned it to a few workers to experiment. The workers who had just come from the countryside did not understand the technology, and added a lot of ash, which was not suitable.
    When Kranchenko learned of this situation, he criticized Comrade Gu Limin at a meeting: "If you don't do it yourself and let the workers do it, and you don't explain it clearly, this is not the attitude that should be taken towards work. If you continue like this, not to mention 'July 1st', I am afraid that new products will not be produced by October 1st!" Comrade Gu Limin felt very sad because his mistakes caused losses to the country. From then on, he personally did the experiment, and in accordance with Kranchenko's instructions, he mixed various ratios, built small brick walls, and mixed the only small box of American brick ash, built another small brick wall, and tested them together by burning them with heavy oil to 1,500 degrees. Kranchenko felt that Gu Limin had corrected his shortcomings, so he publicly praised him at another meeting, and Lao Gu's enthusiasm was even greater.
    When it was time to experiment, Kranchenko gathered everyone together. "How to experiment? There are no instruments." Everyone was a little puzzled. "Instruments are needed, but we have no place to buy them, and no time to buy them. Let's think of a way to solve it ourselves." As Comrade Kranchenko spoke, he took out a steel wire, found some lead blocks, put the burned small brick wall horizontally, and added lead blocks on it until the brick wall that was glued together cracked. Finally, the lead blocks were weighed together, and the compressive strength number was obtained. The test results showed that the compressive strength of the newly made brick ash adhesive was almost twice that of the American product. At this time, the Soviet expert announced to everyone with a smile: "The quality of the brick ash adhesive prepared by our Comrade Gu Limin greatly exceeds that of American products! Comrades! You are all new Chinese engineers! You are all experts in building a new China!" The workers and technicians were so happy that they lifted Comrade Gu Limin up. They worked with even more confidence to repair the experimental furnace.
    During the furnace repair process, Comrade Kranchenko went to the site every day to guide in person, and sometimes gave technical lessons to workers and technicians. With the expert's specific help, the workers who had just come from the countryside quickly mastered the furnace construction technology and created new furnace construction methods. The constructed furnace tanks were neat and strong. During this period, Comrade Kranchenko also formulated a complete work plan, grasped the overall progress, and calculated various materials, raw materials, spare parts, etc. He had to work until eleven or twelve o'clock every night before he could sleep.
    Everything was going smoothly, one success after another. The experimental furnace was repaired. Now is the final key to success - it is time to test the new product. On this day, the young technicians were so happy that they danced. They first sent a telegram to the Nonferrous Metals Bureau saying, "Wait for our good news of the successful test production of new products!" But Kranchenko was very calm. He walked back and forth, watching everything. He reminded everyone, "Be very careful to prevent accidents."
    "Gas is on!" Everyone shouted loudly, spreading the good news to each other. Then the exciting whirring sound came out! Just as everyone was cheering, the small experimental furnace suddenly made a loud "boom" and the furnace mouth burst! So much hard work was instantly lost! However, Kranchenko was still very calm. He said to everyone, "Comrades! Do you think we have failed? No! We are officially starting to move towards success today!"
    After work, the young technicians lay discouraged on their beds. At this time, Comrade Kranchenko personally went to find everyone to play. He asked others to sing, and he also sang; he learned songs from others, and he also taught others songs. He also told everyone stories he had experienced, encouraging everyone to continue to work hard and overcome difficulties stubbornly.
    The next day, everyone found the cause of the explosion of the small experimental furnace. The main reason was that everyone had no experience in sending gas, and there was air in the pipeline, so it exploded as soon as it was ignited. In addition, there was a lack of equipment, and there were many places where the pipeline leaked. After accepting this lesson, everyone began to repair the experimental furnace again. Comrade Kranchenko personally participated in this dismantling and repairing work, and told everyone, "The completion of the equipment does not mean that the test production of products is successful. There are still many difficulties ahead that need to be overcome."
    The small experimental furnace was repaired for the second time. Soon, under the personal control of the Soviet expert, the products that the Japanese devils had failed to produce for many years were finally test-produced. Everyone ran around with the new products, reporting the good news, and immediately the whole factory was about to start formal production!
    Just then, Comrade Kranchenko's vacation to return to his country arrived, but in order to be responsible for this work to the end, he wanted to wait for the final successful test production of the large furnace before returning to his country. He missed his motherland very much, and even more missed the factory where he had worked in the Soviet Union; their factory also often sent him letters telling him about new inventions and creations. He read these good news to everyone, and he himself was so happy and so anxious. He also often thought of his wife and children. How much they were looking forward to him! But he still wrote to tell them that he would go back a few months later.
    The new products were finally all successfully test-produced. The achievements of the Soviet experts are not limited to this. In this factory, new types of technical personnel and technical workers were trained, and a set of socialist management methods was applied.
    October 8th of this year was the second anniversary of the successful test production of new products in this factory. At the commemorative meeting, everyone never forgot Comrade Kranchenko, and unanimously decided to send him a letter, saying in the letter:
    "Based on the advanced experience you taught us, we have created and discovered a large number of advanced experiences and tricks. The output and quality of new products have been greatly improved, and the cost has also been reduced. Dear Comrade Kranchenko! Now we can manufacture bricks and many noble instruments ourselves. Our workers' district has built high-rise buildings, and our lives have been continuously improved on the basis of increased production. Whenever we see new achievements, we think of you, dear Comrade Kranchenko. Although you have left, your great friendship will always remain in the hearts of each of us, and will continue to grow and flourish. In order to build our beloved motherland and defend world peace, let the people of our two countries, China and the Soviet Union, unite more closely!"

    一座在苏联专家直接指导下修复的工厂
    孟浪
    这是东北的一个冶炼工厂，它从伪满时建厂以来，始终没能炼出产品来。尽管日本帝国主义者绞尽脑汁，想从这里掠夺更多的财富，然而由于技术问题没有解决，他们的希望落空了。
    “九三”胜利后，厂子遭到国民党匪帮严重的破坏，已经完全瘫痪了。刚解放时我们看到的是：烟囱上和房顶上铺满了乌鸦粪，到处都是乌鸦窝，机器设备被弄得七零八落，上面积的尘土足有两寸厚。院子里有的地方长满了比人还高的荒草，里面躺着僵死的山猫和野狐狸……。工厂满目荒凉的景况，使人民政府派来的技术人员怔住了。他们在那里调查研究了两个多月，作了一个结论：“设备不够，材料有问题，没有技术人员，培养一个工人最少得三年……三年以内不能修，修起来也炼不出产品来！”
    “真的不能修，修起来也炼不出产品来吗？”该厂领导干部正在苦思而不得答案时，斯大林同志派来的苏联专家们来到了中国。
    到这个工厂来的苏联专家是克兰琴科同志。他是一位工人出身的冶炼专家，四十八岁的人，仍是那样活泼、热情。他到了厂子后，跑上跑下，详细调查研究了七天，最后也下了个结论，这个结论却是：“在最短时间内即可修复，一定能炼出新产品来！”他这个结论震动了原来那两位技术人员。他们心里想：“这个厂完全是美国式的设备，日本人试炼了多少年都失败了，现在要器材没有器材，要技术没有技术，凭什么修复呢？”
    接受苏联专家的意见有许多的思想障碍，怎么办呢？领导上决定请专家和中国技术人员在一起研究。会上，苏联专家发言说：“我奉斯大林同志的命令，来帮助我们最好的朋友进行建设，我一定要完成我的使命！”关于能不能修复并炼出新产品，克兰琴科同志说：“现在中国人民已成为国家的主人，他们要修建自己的工厂，虽然困难是很多的，但我相信一切困难都能很好克服……在我们国家有这么一句格言：‘把好东西作坏了的人是废物、笨蛋；把坏东西做好了的人是英雄好汉！’我相信中国职工，在祖国建设中会出现许多英雄好汉！”
    这次会议，对一些青年技术人员起了很大的教育作用。有的说：“苏联专家说得对，为了建设咱们的祖国，什么困难都要克服！”有的说：“我们一定跟苏联专家好好学技术，把我们的国家建设好。”更重要的是领导思想坚定起来了，决定立即着手恢复和改建工作。这时厂里没有工人，克兰琴科同志说：“只要有人就行，人可以创造一切。”于是工厂从四下找来七位在本厂干过活的老工人，又让他们分头下乡招来一百四十余名翻身农民（这些农民后来都成了优秀的技术工人），人马就齐全了。
    在动工之前，克兰琴科同志特地把年青的技术员们找到办公室里，他拿了一本日历翻来翻去，翻到七月一日，问大家：“这是什么日子？”大家答道：“是我们中国共产党的生日！”“对！中国共产党是中国人民的大救星，为了庆祝它的生日，我们的新产品就要在‘七一’试炼出来！”大家吃了一惊，当天是二月二日，到“七一”还不到五个月，要在这么短的时间内恢复和改建好一个工厂，并炼出新产品来，是一件多么困难的事呵！
    这时，克兰琴科同志订了一个计划。他觉得由恢复改建到试炼产品，主要应该抓住三个关键问题：
    一个是砖的问题：从旧炉上拆下来，磨一磨再用。一个是砖灰和黏合剂的问题：过去都需要向外国买，现在要自己制造。一个是操作技术问题：先修好实验炉，试炼成功后，再修大炉，正式生产。他想：这些问题都要“就地取材”地解决，不能靠外援。为了做好这三件工作，必须使工人和技术人员熟练地掌握先进的炼制技术。
    恢复和改建工作的第一步开始了。新来的农民出身的工人在老工人带领下，着手拆炉子。克兰琴科同志每天都亲自到现场去检查工作。看工人不会拆砖，他就把着手教，并向工人们讲：“不能把砖拆坏了，我们还要用它来修新炉子。这种砖很贵，一块砖可以买一马车粮食……。”所以工人拆砖时都非常仔细，拆下来的砖百分之八九十是完整的。他还叫技术员在拆炉子当中注意找日本鬼子在技术操作上失败的原因。技术员们把炉子的裂缝都画成图、照了像，并研究了每个装置的情形，统共找出十七处不合理的地方，如没留炉子的膨胀空隙，结果把上一节炉的钢板都顶得鼓了起来，并且炉壁也压裂了，等等，这就给以后订立恢复和改建的操作规程准备了条件。
    拆炉工程顺利地完成了。第二步工作便是制造砖灰及其他材料。砖灰，是很贵的东西，当时全厂只有一盒砖灰，所以砖灰在当时要算最大的难题，要是没有它，就是砖磨好了，炉子还是没法修！
    其实，砖灰很简单，把砖磨成粉就是了，问题就在于怎样做黏合剂。克兰琴科同志早预见到这一着。在让大伙拆炉子的同时，他便派了技术员谷立民同志做砖灰黏合剂的试验。在试验合剂之前，克兰琴科同志指出可用水玻璃来调砖灰，并规定了一定的比例。可是谷立民接到这个任务后，自己并没有做，只交给几个工人去试验，刚由农村来的工人不懂技术，弄了许多灰土加进，结果不适用。
    克兰琴科知道了这种情况，便在一次会议上批评了谷立民同志：“自己不亲自下手，让工人去作，还不交代明白，这不是对待工作应有的态度，要这样做下去别说‘七一’，十月一日怕新产品也出不来！”谷立民同志因为自己的过错给国家造成损失，感到很难过。从那以后，他便亲自作试验，依照克兰琴科的指示用各种不同的比例调配好，砌成小砖墙，并把仅有的那一小盒美国砖灰也调好，另砌一小砖墙，一同用重油烧到一千五百度来作试验。克兰琴科觉得谷立民改正了缺点，就在另一次会议上当众表扬了他，老谷的干劲更大了。
    要试验了，克兰琴科把大伙都召集来。“怎样试验呢？也没有仪器。”大家都有些纳闷。“是需要仪器的，可是我们没有地方去买，更没有时间去买，让我们自己来想办法解决吧。”克兰琴科同志说着取出一条钢丝，又找了一些铅块，把烧过的小砖墙横架起来，往上面加铅块，一直加到把黏在一起的砖墙压裂为止。最后把铅块加在一起称一称，就得出抗压力的数字了。试验结果，新制的砖灰黏合剂的抗压力比美国的几乎大一倍。这时苏联专家笑嘻嘻地向大家宣布：“我们谷立民同志配制的砖灰黏合剂，质量大大地超过了美国制品！同志们！你们都是中国的新型工程师！你们都是建设新中国的专家！”工人和技术员高兴得把谷立民同志举了起来。他们更加信心百倍地进行修实验炉的工作了。
    在修炉过程中，克兰琴科同志每天都下现场，亲自指导，有时还给工人和技术员上技术课。在专家这样具体的帮助下，新从农村来的工人们，很快就掌握了砌炉技术，并创造了新的砌炉方法。砌起的炉罐又齐整又结实。在这期间，克兰琴科同志还制订了一个完整的工作计划，掌握总的进度，计算各种材料、原料、备品等，他每夜都要忙到十一二点才能睡觉。
    一切工作进行得都很顺利，一个成功接着一个成功，实验炉修好了，现在是决定成功的最后关键——要试炼新产品了。这一天青年技术员们高兴得手舞足蹈。他们首先给有色金属局拍电报说：“你们等待着我们试炼新产品成功的捷报吧！”但是克兰琴科却很冷静，他走来走去地注视着一切，他提醒大家：“要十分谨慎，以防万一。”
    “通煤气啦！”大家高声地喊着，互相传报喜讯。随之令人兴奋的呜呜声便传出来了！正在大家欢欣鼓舞的时候，小实验炉突然发出“轰”的一声巨响，炉口崩裂了！多少日子的心血，一下就付于流水！可是，克兰琴科仍很冷静，他对大家说：“同志们！你们以为我们这是失败吗？不是的！我们今天才正式开始走向成功！”
    下班后，年青的技术员们都丧气地躺在床上。这时克兰琴科同志亲自去找大伙玩。他叫别人唱歌，自己也唱；跟别人学歌，自己也教别人歌。他又给大家讲自己经历过的故事，鼓励大家继续努力，顽强地克服困难。
    第二天大家就找到了小实验炉爆炸的原因，主要是大家送煤气没有经验，管道内有空气，所以一燃就爆炸了。另外还缺好多设备，管道漏气的地方还很多。接受这次教训，大家又开始重修实验炉。克兰琴科同志亲自参加了这次的拆炉修炉工作，并告诉大家：“设备完成了，并不等于试炼产品成功了，前面还有许许多多困难需要克服。”
    小实验炉第二次修复起来了。不久，在苏联专家亲自掌握下，日本鬼子多少年来没炼出来的产品，终于试炼出来了。大家抱着新产品到处跑着报喜，紧接着全厂就要开始正式生产了！
    正在这时，克兰琴科同志的回国休假的假期到了，可是他为了对这件工作负责到底，要等待大炉子最后试炼成功才回国去。他非常想念自己的祖国，更怀念他在苏联国内工作过的工厂；他们厂里也时常来信告诉他，又有什么新的发明创造。他把这些好消息念给大家听，他自己是那样高兴，又那样心急。他更时常想到自己的爱人和孩子。他们也是多么盼望他呀！但他还是写信告诉他们，说他要晚回去几个月。
    新产品终于全部试炼成功了。苏联专家的成就还不仅于此。在这个厂里，新型的技术人员和技术工人培养起来了，一套社会主义的管理方法被运用了。
    今年十月八日，是这个厂新产品试炼成功两周年纪念日。在纪念大会上，大家都念念不忘克兰琴科同志，一致决定给他寄封信，在信里说：
    “在您教给我们的先进经验的基础上，我们又创造和发掘了大批的先进经验和窍门，新产品不管是产量或是质量都大大地提高了，成本也降低了。亲爱的克兰琴科同志！现在砖和许多高贵的仪器，我们自己也已经全都能制造了。我们的工人区已经盖起了大楼，我们的生活已在生产提高的基础上，不断地得到改善。每当我们看到新的成绩时，我们就想起了您，亲爱的克兰琴科同志。您虽然走了，可是您那伟大的友谊却永远留在我们每个人的心里。并且日益增长滋荣。为了建设我们可爱的祖国，为了保卫人类和平，让我们中苏两国人民更加紧密地团结在一起吧！”
