    Teaching Experience in Promoting a Crash Course Method for Reading Russian Professional Books

    The teachers and students of Tsinghua University and Peking University in Beijing have recently experimented with a crash course method for reading Russian professional books, and the results have been good. This experience is valuable and will have a certain impact on the improvement of China's academic level and the reform of teaching work in universities.

    What is the basis for the crash course in reading Russian professional books? Our natural science workers, technical experts, and university teachers urgently need to learn Russian well in order to learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, improve our teaching work, and train a large number of technical talents for the motherland. This is the first basis for the crash course. Secondly, most of them understand one or more foreign languages, so it is possible to learn Russian using a comparative method; the vocabulary of commonly used scientific and technical terms is extremely narrow, and it is possible to intensively study the necessary number of words in a short period of time; most professional terms are loanwords (with slight differences in letters), and the pronunciations are familiar words; and the syntax of professional books is the simplest and most straightforward, with very few dialects or slang, and even fewer figurative descriptions. This is the second basis for the crash course. In addition, good teaching methods provide favorable conditions for the crash course. Therefore, we can adopt a method of focusing on key breakthroughs to achieve the goal of a crash course in reading Russian professional books.

    The main characteristic of the crash course method for reading Russian professional books is concentrating time and energy, without allowing any distraction. Therefore, the administrative departments must ensure that students are free from other work during the learning period so that they can concentrate on their studies. In teaching, a concentrated and intensive approach must be adopted, separating the teaching of grammar from vocabulary exercises, so as not to distract attention. To achieve this, it is first necessary to conduct full ideological mobilization among the students, so that everyone recognizes that learning Russian is a political task, not an easy one; at the same time, it should be pointed out to them that everyone must have the spirit to resolutely overcome difficulties in their studies, otherwise they will not be able to complete the learning task. In addition, it is also necessary to establish good teaching systems and methods. The teaching and research group should be fully responsible for the students, ensuring that each student learns well, and those who fall behind should also be helped. Students should have absolute trust in the teaching and research group and follow their guidance. Before teaching, clear goals and requirements should be put forward for each stage and each lesson. The content and amount of the lectures should be appropriately arranged; the teaching methods should be improved at any time according to the students' requirements.

    Of course, the current crash course method for reading Russian professional books is not yet perfect. It is limited to reading professional Russian books, rather than learning all of Russian. It is only carried out under specific purposes, objects, and conditions; and it still has many shortcomings that must be remedied, such as shortcomings in pronunciation. Therefore, this kind of crash course in Russian learning can never replace regular learning. After this kind of learning is over, continuous learning must be carried out to constantly consolidate and improve.

    Learning the Russian language—the language of Lenin and Stalin—and absorbing the experiences of the great Soviet Union in all aspects is of great significance to the construction of our motherland. We hope that Russian language teachers will continue to create better teaching experiences!

    推广俄文专业书籍阅读速成法的教学经验
    北京清华大学、北京大学两校师生，最近试行俄文专业书籍阅读速成法，成绩良好。这个经验是宝贵的，它对于我国学术水平的提高以及高等学校教学工作的改革都将发生一定的影响。
    俄文专业书籍阅读可以速成的根据在那里呢？我们的自然科学工作者、技术专家以及大学教师，都迫切要求学好俄文，以便学习苏联的先进经验，改进我们的教学工作，为祖国培养大批的技术人材。这是速成的第一个根据。其次，他们大多懂得一种或一种以上的外国语文，因此有可能用比较法来学习俄文；科学技术的常用语汇范围又极为狭窄，在短期间突击学习必需数量的语汇是可能的；专业用语大部分都是外来语（在字母方面稍有不同），读出音来都是熟词；而专业书籍的句法最为简明、朴素，极少方言、俚语，更没有形象的描写。这是速成的第二个根据。此外，良好的教学方法又为速成提供了有利的条件。因此我们可以采取重点突破的办法，来达到俄文专业书籍阅读速成的目的。
    俄文专业书籍阅读速成法的主要特点是集中时间、集中精力，丝毫不容许精神的分散。因此，行政方面必须保证学员在学习期间摆脱其他工作，使他们能专心一意地学习。在教学上须采取集中突击的方法，把文法的讲授和生字练习分开，这样才不致分散注意力。要做到这一点，首先必须在学员中进行充分的思想动员，使大家认识到学习俄文是一项政治任务，并不是轻而易举的；同时向他们指出：每一个人在学习中必须具有坚决克服困难的精神，否则就不能完成学习任务。此外，还必须建立良好的教学制度和方法。教学研究组对于学员要负全部责任，使每一个学员学好，掉队的也要加以帮助。学员对教学研究组要绝对信任，听从指导。教学前，对每一阶段、每一堂课要提出明确的目的和要求。在讲授的内容、分量上，应适当地加以安排；讲授方法要随时根据学员的要求加以改进。
    自然，现在的俄文专业书籍阅读速成法还是不够完备的，它只限于阅读专业俄文书，而不是学习全部俄文。它只是在特定的目的、对象、条件下进行学习；而且它还有很多必须补救的缺点，如发音方面的缺点等。因此，这种俄文速成学习决不能代替正规学习。在这种学习结束后，还必须进行经常的学习，这样才能不断地巩固、提高。
    学习俄罗斯语言——列宁、斯大林的语言，吸收伟大苏联的各方面的经验，对于我们祖国的建设有着非常重要的意义。希望俄文教学工作者继续创造更好的教学经验！
