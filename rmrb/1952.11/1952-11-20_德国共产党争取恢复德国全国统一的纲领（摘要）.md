Xinhua News Agency Dispatch from Berlin, TASS, 13th:

    The West German people are living in extreme poverty. The criminal war of Hitler's Germany, coupled with the subsequent defeat, caused the deaths of millions and immense destruction. West Germany, separated from East Germany after the war, is also subjected to the enslavement of American, British, and French imperialism.
    It has now been proven that the purpose of the three capitalist countries—the United States, Britain, and France—in waging the last war was not, as they declared during the war, to liberate Germany from Hitler's rule. Their aim was to destroy Germany as a nation, to defeat their competitor, to seize and plunder our resources, and to use our people and our country to prepare for another war for world hegemony. However, they failed to conquer East Germany. With the help of the Soviet army, East Germany eliminated the Hitler regime and all imperialist enslavement, embarking on a new path of democratic and peaceful development charted by the Potsdam Agreement.
    After the Western countries' plan to enslave the whole of Germany failed, they, under the instigation of the United States, divided Germany into two parts in order to plunder our wealthy western half. They have violated their obligations under the Potsdam Agreement: to maintain the unity of Germany, to enable it to carry out democratic construction, and to eliminate militarism. They obstruct the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany and refuse to withdraw their occupying forces. They refuse to make any attempt to establish mutual understanding between East and West Germany.
    Taking advantage of West Germany's temporary weakness, they forced it to accept the General Treaty and the Paris Agreements, attempting to use these treaties to perpetuate the division of Germany, to legitimize the enslavement and plunder of West Germany, and to extend foreign occupation for fifty years.
    The American, British, and French occupying authorities currently control the entire life of the Federal Republic. Not only the West German economy, but also the entire domestic and foreign policy of West Germany, the whole life of West Germany, are in the hands of the American occupying authorities.
    In this situation, all the people are living in misery.
    However, the American imperialists are not satisfied with the current enslavement, plunder, and humiliation of the West German people. They want to drag West Germany into the new aggressive war they are preparing.
    For such a purpose, the American imperialists are arming West Germany and stepping up the establishment of a German mercenary army.
    Without the Adenauer regime, American, British, and French imperialism would not be able to maintain their rule of national oppression and humiliation in West Germany.
    The Adenauer regime represents the rule of German monopoly capitalists, large landowners, revanchists, and militarists. These reactionary forces, like the American imperialists, are attempting to prevent the restoration of German unity in accordance with the principles of peace and democracy, to prevent the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany, and to prevent the termination of the occupation of West Germany.
    The Adenauer regime is the enemy of the people's rights and even the slightest trace of democracy.
    If the West German people are to survive, they must overthrow the Adenauer regime.
    The overthrow of the Adenauer regime will facilitate the establishment of a government for the restoration of national unity that can be supported by all patriotic forces in West Germany.
    If the leaders of West Germany are such a government, a government that is unwilling to support and endorse foreign enslavers and is striving for national unity, the Western occupying authorities will inevitably have to change their policies. They will have to agree to unify Germany, conclude a peace treaty, and withdraw their occupying forces.
    In this way, the West German people will be freed from the oppression of the occupiers and, after unification with East Germany, will live carefree lives in a unified, independent, and prosperous Germany. The West German people are now increasingly aware that the German people, like all other people, have the right to decide their own destiny and have the right to establish their own democratic country without any foreign interference. The West German people have increasingly realized that in the struggle for a happy future, they must first rely on themselves and demonstrate their own strength.
    The basic demands of the German people—unity, peace, and independence—have been written on a glorious banner. The main obstacles now are the General Treaty and the Paris War Agreements, which prevent the German people from realizing these demands and drive them towards division and war. These obstacles must be eliminated. Therefore, the urgent goals of the German people must be: to conclude a peace treaty, to hold all-German elections to unify Germany, and to withdraw the occupying forces. The German people must concentrate their efforts to achieve these goals. Only the signing of a just peace treaty and the withdrawal of the occupying forces can guarantee a lasting unity and independence for a peace-loving, democratic Germany.
    If the German people are to win their great struggle for unity, peace, and independence, they must have a strong force. This force exists.
    The working class, which accounts for more than half of the West German population, is the most powerful force of the German nation.
    The peasantry is the closest ally of the working class in the struggle for national liberation. The alliance of workers and peasants is an indestructible force, the only force that can guarantee the victory of the cause of restoring German unity.
    The struggle for the restoration of national unity also serves the most fundamental and important interests of other strata of people in West Germany.
    This explains why white-collar workers and civil servants, liberal professionals, artisans and small businessmen, small and medium-sized entrepreneurs, and a large portion of West German industrialists and businessmen who dislike war and war production will participate in the alliance of the working class and the peasantry. The survival of the majority of the people has been threatened by the measures of the Western occupying authorities and Adenauer, as well as by the policy of preparing for another war.
    All patriotic intellectuals: scientists, cultural and artistic workers, all those engaged in mental labor, will participate in this alliance. They know that only in a unified and independent Germany can German culture develop and can scientists and cultural workers carry out free, creative endeavors for the benefit of the people.
    All progressive people in West Germany, regardless of their social status and world view, will participate in this alliance, because they all demand German unity, freedom, and independence, as well as continuous economic and cultural development.
    Therefore, we must establish mutual understanding among all patriotic people, among all good people in West and East Germany, and organize them for joint action.
    The right-wing leaders of the Social Democratic Party and the trade unions are attempting to prevent the establishment of unified action by the working class and the solidarity of the nation's main forces. On the one hand, they say they oppose the Adenauer government, they disagree with Adenauer's policies. In this way, they cater to the dissatisfaction of the working class and other strata of people with Adenauer's policies and the American occupiers, pretending to oppose this policy. But, on the other hand, they openly defend the foundations of the current regime in West Germany, hinder Germany from taking the path of national unity, and consistently fail to fulfill their own words and promises to the people. Therefore, they betray the interests of the working class and the nation...
    The right-wing leaders of the German Social Democratic Party and the trade unions have close ties with the British, American, and French occupying forces.
    Their opposition to the General Treaty, the Paris War Agreements, and the Adenauer government is hypocritical and insincere. In fact, the right-wing Social Democrats themselves are an important link in the Bonn regime system established by the United States.
    Members of the German Social Democratic Party and supporters of the Social Democratic Party must understand the fraudulent trick of their right-wing leaders who want to please both sides and must break away from their political line. All Social Democratic workers, Communist workers, Christian Democratic Union workers, and unorganized workers and all working people must establish joint action to strive for the realization of their national and social demands.
    The just struggle of the vast camp of patriotic people in West Germany has extremely powerful allies.
    The people of the German Democratic Republic warmly support our struggle for national unity and peace. The people of the German Democratic Republic, liberated from the chains of imperialism, are systematically and increasingly perfecting the first thorough democratic system on German soil. The patriotic people of West Germany know that their brothers and sisters in the German Democratic Republic are their loyal and reliable supporters. The peaceful construction of the German Democratic Republic is beneficial to all the German people and to the cause of national reunification and West Germany's liberation from the shackles and shame of imperialist occupation.
    The West German patriots who are fighting for unity, peace, and independence receive the deep sympathy and friendship of all peace-loving people around the world, a friendship clearly expressed in the position of the great socialist Soviet Union—the German people's most powerful friend. The Soviet Union has always and consistently advocated that Germany must obtain complete national independence, equality, and unrestricted development of a peaceful economy. The current global movement for a peaceful resolution of the German question is proof of the great support for the German people’s liberation movement.
    The day is not far off when the German people will overthrow the Adenauer regime, at which time the rule of the American occupiers and their German lackeys will end, and a road will be opened for the establishment of a unified, democratic, and independent Germany. The will of the people must become the supreme law.
            The Goals of the West German National Liberation Struggle
    The German Communist Party strives to unite the West German people to jointly carry out the struggle for the restoration of German national unity in order to achieve the following goals:
    Restore the unity of Germany and make Germany a unified, democratic, peace-loving, and independent country; conclude a peace treaty with Germany.
    1.  An agreement should be reached immediately between West and East Germany to hold all-German free elections without delay and establish a National Assembly. West Germany and East Germany should jointly demand the early conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany and the withdrawal of all occupying forces.
    2.  A committee composed of representatives from East and West Germany should investigate the prerequisites for holding all-German free elections throughout Germany and draft an election law to ensure that such elections can be held.
    3.  End the division of Germany and restore Germany to unity, making it a unified, democratic, peace-loving, and independent country. The Saar is an inseparable part of Germany.
    4.  Conclude a peace treaty as soon as possible, guaranteeing Germany's national independence and territorial integrity in the treaty.
    5.  After the conclusion of the peace treaty, all occupying forces should withdraw from German territory.
    6.  No foreign country has the right to maintain military bases on German territory.
    7.  The German people should have the right to establish their national armed forces and manufacture the weapons necessary for these armed forces in order to defend their independence, their peaceful labor, and their territory.
    8.  The German people should not participate in military alliances against other countries.
    9.  Establish a committee composed of representatives from West and East Germany to participate in the four-power conference for the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany. During the negotiations, this committee must adhere to the principles listed above. The treaty should be signed by an all-German government and ratified by a freely elected National Assembly.
    10. The National Assembly should decide on Germany's democratic and social system, as well as its foreign policy, which must be a policy of maintaining friendly relations with both East and West, advocating the defense of peace, and consolidating international friendship.
            Guarantee the Democratic Freedoms of the German People
    1.  Repeal all laws and regulations aimed at restricting the democratic freedoms of the German people.
    2.  Legally guarantee all democratic rights and freedoms, such as freedom of the press, freedom of assembly, freedom to organize trade unions, freedom to strike, freedom of expression, freedom of religion, and the inviolability of individuals and families.
    3.  Prohibit and punish war propaganda, racial hatred propaganda, and propaganda inciting national hostility. Militaristic and fascist organizations and alliances must be dissolved.
            Freely Develop Germany's Peaceful Economy
    1.  Repeal all restrictions on the development of Germany's peaceful economy. Encourage and guarantee the development of the peaceful economy in various ways.
    2.  Enterprises of large Konzerns, enterprises of the mining and metallurgical industries, large chemical factories, large banks, large insurance companies, and enterprises whose factory owners support Adenauer's traitorous regime should be confiscated and made the property of the people.
    3.  Enterprises that have encountered difficulties due to the measures of the occupying countries and the Adenauer government's war economic policy, especially small enterprises, handicrafts, and agricultural enterprises, should receive state assistance. Encourage private initiative.
    4.  The phenomenon of foreign capital, especially American capital, controlling the West German economy must be eliminated. Carry out foreign trade in accordance with the principles of free trade on an equal basis.
    5.  In order to ensure the supply of food to the people, maximize agricultural production, and develop cultivation and animal husbandry, the land should be distributed fairly.
    Therefore, all properties exceeding one hundred hectares should be distributed to poor peasants, returned resettled farmers, and farm laborers.
    6.  In order to guarantee the lives of farmers, the state should protect and help all farm households, provide farmers with a large number of long-term interest-free loans to help them develop. After reducing the excessive taxes borne by farm households and eliminating the phenomenon of excessive price differences between agricultural products and industrial products, it will be possible to formulate a price that is in line with the interests of farmers and the broad masses of consumers.
    The losses suffered by agricultural enterprises due to the actions of the occupying authorities must be fully compensated. Confiscated land must be returned to farmers.
            Social Principles
    1.  The peace treaty will save our people from paying billions of marks, which are now extorted from the people to maintain the occupying regime and arm West Germany. No longer paying this huge sum will lay the foundation for the new development of a peaceful economy. Therefore, there will be money to improve the lives of workers, white-collar workers, intellectuals, especially young people; to extensively repair houses and maintain the lives of the victims of the last war; to guarantee returned resettled people the cost of living and working; and to increase the amount of subsidies for all those who have already received them.
    2.  Widely develop the peaceful economy of democratic Germany and develop foreign trade without hindrance to guarantee full employment for all healthy people and eliminate unemployment.
    3.  Guarantee that workers, white-collar workers, and trade unions of workers and white-collar workers in enterprise departments and economic departments have full rights to participate in the management of enterprises. All laws and regulations that restrict or abolish this right to any extent are declared invalid.
    4.  Formulate a single regulation on social relief and accidental event relief issues. The autonomous rights of insurance institutions with many trade unions participating must be legally guaranteed. All laws and regulations that violate these principles are declared invalid. Guarantee full protection of the people's labor and health. The amount of relief money must be determined in accordance with the general minimum cost of living.
    5.  Unfair tax rules that burden the masses heavily must be abolished. Unify the tax rules according to social principles.
    6.  The law should guarantee women equal rights in civil rights, especially in family rights, and in national, economic, and cultural life.
    7.  The law guarantees protection for mothers and children. Women and young people should receive equal pay for equal work.
    8.  In order to guarantee widespread assistance to young people in obtaining employment, helping them to study, and helping them to organize recreational and sports activities, a series of measures should be implemented to provide young people with all opportunities for education, recreation, and development, and to guarantee young men and women full democratic rights and a happy life.
    9.  The state vigorously supports housing construction plans in order to provide people with sufficient housing at rents that do not exceed their ability to pay. Rebuild destroyed towns according to the height requirements of residential housing and national traditions.
    Develop Science and Culture
    1.  Repair destroyed cultural facilities and build universities, middle and primary schools, museums, theaters, churches, and libraries.
    2.  Restore freedom of scientific research. Expand German universities, other higher education institutions, and scientific research institutes, and provide them with the necessary assistance from the state.
    3.  In order to guarantee the further development of German art and literature, with the strong support of the state, German writers, artists, sculptors, and musicians should have various conditions to fully develop their creativity, thereby promoting the peaceful development of our people.
    4.  In order to ensure that every young person can receive vocational training according to their personal abilities, a unified and progressive school system should be established, guaranteeing free tuition and free textbooks.
    The People's Just Cause Will Surely Triumph
    After these demands of the German people are realized, the German people will become the masters of their own destiny, and they will overcome poverty and scarcity and obtain a happy life of peace and contentment.
    Any government that approves the realization of these minimum demands of the entire nation will receive the full support of the German Communist Party.
    The German Communist Party calls on all patriotic people in Germany, especially workers and peasants, to bravely and confidently unite within the National Front of democratic Germany and fight to achieve these goals.

    德国共产党争取恢复德国全国统一的纲领（摘要）
    西德人民过着非常贫困的生活。希特勒德国的罪恶战争加上随之而来的失败，使数百万人民死亡，并造成了巨大的破坏。在战后与东德分割开来的西德，又受到了美、英、法帝国主义的奴役。
    现在已经证明，这三个资本主义国家——美国、英国和法国——进行上次战争的目的并不是像它们在战时所宣布的那样，想把德国从希特勒的统治下解放出来。它们的目的是要摧毁德国这个国家，把它们这个竞争者打倒，侵占和掠夺我们的资源，并利用我国人民和我们的国家准备另一次争取世界霸权的战争。但是，它们没有能够征服东德。东德在苏军的帮助下，扫除了希特勒的政权以及一切帝国主义的奴役，走上了波茨坦协定所开拓的民主及和平发展的新道路。
    西方国家想要奴役整个德国的打算失败以后，它们就在美国的倡导下，把德国分裂为两部分，以便进行掠夺我国富饶的西半部。它们已经违反了它们根据波茨坦协定所承担的义务：维持德国的统一，使它能够进行民主建设和肃清军国主义。它们阻挠缔结对德和约并拒绝撤退占领军。它们拒绝作任何尝试以便在东德与西德之间建立相互了解。
    它们利用西德暂时的软弱，强迫它接受一般性条约和巴黎协定，企图用条约来保持使德国继续被分裂，使对西德的奴役和掠夺成为合法的事，并使外国占领延长到五十年。
    美国、英国和法国占领当局目前控制着联邦共和国的整个生活。不但西德的经济，而且西德的整个内政和外交方面的政策，西德的整个生活，都掌握在美国占领当局的手里。
    在这种情况下，全体人民正处于水深火热之中。
    然而，美帝国主义者并不满足于目前对西德人民的奴役、掠夺和侮辱。他们想把西德拖入他们正在准备的新侵略战争中去。
    为了这样一个目的，美帝国主义者正在武装西德，并加紧建立一支德国雇佣军。
    如果没有阿登纳政权，美、英、法帝国主义就不可能在西德保持他们的民族压迫和侮辱的统治。
    阿登纳政权代表着德国垄断资本家、大地主、复仇主义者和军国主义者的统治。这些反动势力也和美帝国主义者一样，企图阻止根据和平与民主的方针恢复德国的统一，企图阻止缔结对德和约，企图阻止终止对西德的占领。
    阿登纳政权是人民权利和哪怕是一丝一毫民主痕迹的敌人。
    西德人民假使要生存，就必须推翻阿登纳政权。
    推翻阿登纳政权，就会便于成立一个可以得到西德一切爱国力量支持的争取恢复全国统一的政府。
    假使西德的领导者是这样一个政府，是一个不愿意拥护和支持外国奴役者的争取全国统一的政府，西方占领当局就势必要改变它们的政策。它们将不得不同意统一德国、缔结和约及撤退占领军队。
    这样，西德人民就能得免于占领者的压迫，并在与东德统一以后，在一个统一、独立及繁荣的德国过无忧无虑的生活。现在西德人民日益明了，德国人民也像所有其他人民一样，有权利自己来决定他们自己的命运，并且有权利不受任何外国的干涉来建立他们自己的民主国家。西德人民已越来越清楚地认识到，在争取幸福前途的斗争中，它首先必须要依靠自己，必须要表现它自己的力量。
    德国人民的基本要求——要求统一、和平与独立，已经被写在一面光辉的旗帜上面。现在主要的障碍就是一般性条约和巴黎战争协定，这些障碍阻止德国人民实现这些要求，并驱使他们走向分裂与战争。这种障碍必须予以消除。因此，德国人民的迫切目标必须是：缔结和约、举行全德选举以求统一德国、撤退占领军队。德国人民必须集中力量来争取达到这些目标。只有签订一个公正的和约和撤退占领军，才能保证一个爱好和平的民主德国获得持久的统一和独立。
    德国人民要想获得他们争取统一、和平与独立的伟大斗争的胜利，就必须有强大的力量。这种力量是存在的。
    占西德人口半数以上的工人阶级是德意志民族最强大的力量。
    农民是工人阶级争取民族解放斗争中的最亲密的同盟者。工人和农民的联盟是一支不可摧毁的力量，是唯一能够保证德国恢复统一事业获得胜利的力量。
    争取恢复国家统一的斗争，目的也是符合西德其他各阶层人民最根本的重要利益的。
    这说明为什么职员和公务员、自由职业者、技工和小商人、中小企业主和一大部分西德的工商业家都将参加工人阶级与农民的联盟，这些人是不喜欢战争和战争生产的。大多数人民的生存已经受到西方占领当局和阿登纳的措施以及准备另一次战争的政策的威胁。
    所有具有爱国心的知识分子：科学家、文化艺术工作者、一切从事脑力劳动的人，都将参加这个联盟。他们知道，只有在一个统一而独立的德国，德国的文化才有可能发展，科学家和文化工作者才有可能为人民的利益而进行自由的、创造性的努力。
    西德一切进步人士，不问他们的社会地位和世界观如何，都将参加这个联盟，因为他们都要求德国统一、自由和独立，在经济上和文化上不断发展。
    因此，我们必须在所有的爱国人士中间，在所有西德和东德的善良人士中间，建立相互的了解，组织他们联合行动。
    社会民主党和工会的右翼头子们企图组止建立工人阶级的统一行动和全国主要力量的团结。一方面，他们说他们反对阿登纳政府，他们不同意阿登纳的政策。这样，他们就投合了工人阶级和其他各阶层人民对阿登纳政策和美国占领者的不满，装模作样地表示他们反对这种政策。但是，另一方面，他们公然维护西德现政权的基础，阻碍德国走民族统一的道路，一贯地不履行他们自己对人民所说的话与所作的诺言。因此，他们背叛了工人阶级与民族的利益……
    德国社会民主党和工会的右翼头子们是与英、美、法占领军有着密切联系的。
    他们反对一般性条约、巴黎战争协定和阿登纳政府是虚伪的，不诚心的。事实上，右翼社会民主党人自己就是美国建立的波恩政权体系中的一个重要环节。
    德国社会民主党的党员及社会民主党的支持者必须了解他们的右翼头子们想两头讨好的欺诈把戏，必须脱离他们的政治路线。所有社会民主党工人、共产党工人、基督教民主联盟工人以及尚未组织起来的工人和一切劳动人民，必须建立起联合行动，以争取实现他们的民族与社会要求。
    西德爱国人民的巨大阵营的正义斗争是有着极强大的盟友的。
    德意志民主共和国人民热烈地支持我们争取全国统一与和平的斗争。从帝国主义锁链下解放出来的德意志民主共和国的人民正在德国土地上有计划地、日臻完善地建立起第一个彻底的民主制度。西德爱国人民知道，他们的在德意志民主共和国的兄弟姊妹们是他们的忠实可靠的支持者。德意志民主共和国的和平建设是有利于全体德国人民的，是有利于全国重新统一与西德摆脱帝国主义占领的镣铐和耻辱的事业的。
    为统一、和平与独立而奋斗的西德爱国者得到全世界所有爱好和平的人民的深切同情与友谊，这种友谊明显地表现在伟大的社会主义苏联——德国人民最强大的朋友——的主张上。苏联随时随地都以不变的坚定态度主张德国必须获得完全的民族独立、平等及和平经济的无限制的发展。目前在全世界普遍开展的争取和平解决德国问题的运动就是德国人民解放运动得到伟大支援的证明。
    德国人民推翻阿登纳政权的日子已经不远了，那时就可以结束美国占领者及其德国走狗们的统治，而为建立一个统一、民主与独立的德国开辟一条道路。人民的意志必将成为最高的法律。
            西德民族解放斗争的目标
    德国共产党努力团结西德人民，共同进行争取恢复德国全国统一的斗争，以达到下列目标：
    恢复德国的统一，使德国成为一个统一、民主、爱好和平与独立的国家；缔结对德和约。
    一、西德与东德之间立刻达成协议，以便毫不迟延地举行全德自由选举，成立国民议会，西德和东德联合要求早日缔结对德和约，并撤退所有占领军队。
    二、由东德与西德代表组成一个委员会，在全德国调查举行全德自由选举的先决条件，并拟定一个选举法，保证这种选举能够举行。
    三、结束德国的分裂，使德国恢复统一，成为统一、民主、爱好和平和独立的国家。萨尔是德国不可分割的一部分。
    四、早日缔结和约，在和约中保证德国的民族独立和主权完整。
    五、在缔结和约后，所有的占领军队都撤离德国领土。
    六、任何外国都没有权利在德国领土上保有军事基地。
    七、德国人民为了保卫他们的独立、他们的和平劳动、他们的领土，应有建立他们的国家武装部队以及制造这些武装部队所必需的武器的权利。
    八、德国人民不参加反对其它国家的军事联盟。
    九、建立一个由西德和东德代表组成的委员会来参加缔结对德和约的四国会议，在谈判期间，这个委员会必须遵守上面列举的原则。和约由一个全德政府签署，并由自由选举出来的国民议会批准。
    十、国民议会决定德国的民主的和社会的制度，以及它的外交政策，这政策必须是一个与东西方都保持友好关系，主张保卫和平和巩固国际友谊的政策。
            保证德国人民的民主自由
    一、废除一切目的在于限制德国人民的民主自由的法律和条规。
    二、用法律保障一切民主权利和自由，例如出版自由、集会自由、组织工会的自由、举行罢工的自由、自由表示意见的自由、宗教信仰的自由、以及个人和家庭的不可侵犯性。
    三、禁止并惩处战争宣传、种族仇视宣传，以及煽动各民族互相敌视的宣传。军国主义和法西斯主义的组织和联盟必须解散。
            自由发展德国的和平经济
    一、废除对于发展德国和平经济的一切限制。鼓励并以各种办法保证和平经济的发展。
    二、大康采恩的企业、采矿工业和冶金工业的企业、大化学工厂、大银行、大保险公司，以及其厂主支持阿登纳的卖国政权的企业，都应没收使之成为人民的财产。
    三、凡是由于占领国的措施以及阿登纳政府的战争经济政策而遭遇困难的企业，特别是小企业、手工业和农业企业，应受到国家的帮助。鼓励私人经营的积极性。
    四、外国资本，特别是美国资本控制西德经济的现象必须消除。按照在平等的基础上与自由交易的原则进行对外贸易。
    五、为了保障对人民的粮食供应、尽量提高农业生产、发展耕作和牲畜饲养业，公平地分配土地。
    因此，凡超过一百公顷的地产，一律分给贫农、返国定居的农民以及雇农。
    六、为了保障农民的生活，国家应保护和帮助所有农户，对农民大量发放长期的无息贷款，帮助他们发展。在减轻农户所负担的过重赋税以及消灭了农业品与工业品差价太大的现象以后，就有可能制订一种符合于农民以及广大消费者的利益的价格。
    占领当局使农业企业所遭受的损失要完全得到赔偿。没收的土地必须归还农民。
            社会原则
    一、和约会使我国人民不再付出以数十亿计的巨款，现在这笔向人民勒索来的款项是用来维持占领政权及武装西德之用的。不再付出这笔巨款，便可以为和平经济的新发展奠定基础。因此将有钱改善工人、职员、知识分子，特别是青年的生活；可以大规模增修房屋和维持上次战争的受害者的生活；保证返国定居的人民获得生活及工作的费用；增加所有已经取得津贴的人的津贴数额。
    二、广泛发展民主德国的和平经济及毫不受阻挠地发展对外贸易，以保证所有健康的人全部就业，并消除失业现象。
    三、保证工人、职员及企业部门和经济各部门中工人与职员的工会都有充分的权利参加企业的管理。凡是在任何程度上限制或取消这种权利的一切法律与条例一律宣布作废。
    四、制定关于社会救济与意外事件救济问题的单一法规。凡是有许多工会参加的保险机构的自治权利必须得到法律的保障。违反这些原则的一切法律与条例一律宣布作废。保证充分保护人民的劳动和健康。必须按照一般最起码的生活费用决定救济金的数额。
    五、必须废除不合社会公道的、使群众负担沉重的税则。根据社会的原则统一税则。
    六、法律应保障妇女在公民权利、特别是在家庭权利方面，以及在国家、经济和文化生活中享有平等的权利。
    七、法律保障给予母亲及孩子以保护。妇女和青年在工作上应同工同酬。
    八、为了保证广泛地帮助青年获得职业，帮助他们学习并帮助他们组织休养和体育活动，应实行一系列的措施，使青年获得受教育、休养和发展的一切机会，保障男女青年享有充分的民主权利和幸福的生活。
    九、国家大力支持房屋修建计划，以便使人民获得足够的住屋，而房租又不超出他们所能负担的能力之外。按照居住用房屋的高度要求标准以及民族传统，重建被破坏的城镇。
    发展科学与文化
    一、修复被毁的文化设备，兴修大学、中小学、博物馆、戏院、教堂和图书馆等建筑。
    二、恢复科学研究的自由。扩充德国各大学、其他的高等教育机关以及科学研究所，并由国家给予必要的帮助。
    三、为了保证德国的艺术和文学进一步发展，应在国家的大力支持下，使德国作家、艺术家、雕刻家和音乐家能有各种条件充分发挥他们的创作力，从而促进我国人民的和平发展。
    四、为了保障每个青年能按照个人能力受到职业训练，应制定一个统一而进步的学校制度，保证免收学费，并免费供给教科书。
    人民的正义事业必定胜利
    德国人民这些要求实现以后，德国人民就会成为自己命运的主人，他们就会克服贫困与匮乏而获得安居乐业的幸福生活。
    任何赞成实现全国人民这些最低要求的政府，都会得到德国共产党的全力支持。
    德国共产党号召德国全体爱国人民，首先是工人和农民，勇敢而满怀信心地团结在民主德国全国阵线之内，为实现这些目标而奋斗。
