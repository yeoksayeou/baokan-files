The recovery phase of our national economy is nearing its end, and a new large-scale construction is about to begin. The scale of our construction in the future will be unprecedented, and we will complete the workload of the past few decades. Some complex, modern enterprises of unprecedented scale and of decisive significance for our country's industrialization will be gradually built in the future. The sooner or later these enterprises are established will determine the degree and speed of our country's industrialization. This is an unprecedentedly complex and arduous new task.

In order to enable our industrial production to grow continuously at a relatively rapid rate, this requires us to carry out large-scale basic construction work. Over the past three years, the state's investment in basic construction has increased year by year, and next year's investment in basic construction will increase even more than this year's, with industrial investment increasing even more. Therefore, the proportion of basic construction in the overall work has undergone a fundamental change, and basic construction work has been elevated to a primary position in the overall national work. Whether we can build an industrialized country depends first on whether we can ensure the success of basic construction. All views and practices that neglect basic construction must be strictly criticized.

Of course, our basic construction work is not without difficulties and contradictions. The main contradiction of basic construction is that its task is very important, but our strength is still very weak. Whether it is geological exploration, design, or construction, the strength is far from meeting the needs of large-scale construction, sometimes differing by a factor of two, three, or even dozens. The basic construction tasks of individual units are very heavy, but the basic construction organizations have not yet been established. This serious situation cannot be allowed to continue.

Why is our basic construction force so weak? This is because in the past three years, we have been busy with land reform, suppressing counter-revolutionaries, and resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea throughout the country. The main task of all economic departments in our country in the past was to restore production and carry out production reform. There was also some basic construction in the past, but it was only some restoration and renovation projects. The attention of leading organs and cadres could not but be focused on production in the past, which was appropriate under the circumstances at the time. But today, if we continue to do so, it would be inappropriate. Now we must put basic construction work in a primary position. We need to immediately put the best cadres, technicians, and skilled workers into the basic construction departments (including geological departments) to rapidly increase the strength of basic construction in order to shoulder the task of large-scale economic construction. Placing basic construction in a primary position must become a common policy for the entire country to implement from now on. We must strive to implement this policy, otherwise everything will be empty talk.

To implement this policy, we must oppose two erroneous tendencies. One is a left-leaning, rash tendency. This is a failure to understand the complexity of basic construction projects, treating new construction projects as easy. These people believe that as long as the higher authorities approve the investment, the new construction projects can be completed, viewing the establishment of modern factories as easy as opening a handicraft workshop, and viewing the new factories as simple as maintaining factory production during the takeover period. Therefore, they neither design carefully nor construct accurately, resulting in completely useless fertilizer factories like the one in Guangzhou, and causing many reworkings and wastes throughout the country. This error has been corrected after last year's review, but what has emerged is another right-leaning, conservative tendency. Its manifestation is that in designing materials, they only seek safety and do not hesitate to waste materials, treating "no construction without design" as a justification for delaying construction. Both of these tendencies are wrong. We must continue to oppose the left-leaning, rash tendency, and at the same time, we must oppose the right-leaning, conservative tendency.

The key to overcoming the contradiction between the heavy tasks and weak forces in basic construction work lies in rapidly increasing the strength of basic construction, in rapidly increasing the strength of geological exploration, design, and construction. Only in this way is it possible to overcome the serious phenomenon of investment not being used up, basic construction tasks not being completed year after year, and poor engineering quality.

Increasing the strength of basic construction means that we must plan to establish various professional colleges, various specialized schools, various technical schools, various short-term training courses, and use the method of apprenticeship in various basic construction engineering teams to train various technicians and skilled workers. These are necessary, and some have already begun, and of course, we must do our best to do them. But these forces cannot grow in a year and a half. Therefore, in order to meet the heavy basic construction tasks of 1953, we must immediately follow the methods stipulated at the Basic Construction Conference of the Financial and Economic Committee of the Central People's Government's Government Administration Council and actively transfer personnel from the production sector. This is the largest and most reliable method of increasing the strength of basic construction at present.

Of course, transferring excellent cadres, technicians, and skilled workers from the production sector to the basic construction sector will not be without obstacles. But these obstacles must be overcome. The obstacles that have already manifested themselves are in the following three aspects:

First, some departments have a wait-and-see and dependent mentality in basic construction work. For example, some are waiting for the personnel departments to allocate cadres to them, but they are unwilling to quickly and actively transfer cadres from their subordinate production departments; some want to rely on the construction engineering departments to build for them, but they are unwilling to actively organize and expand the construction teams. The personnel departments have already allocated a batch of cadres to the basic construction departments, and they will continue to allocate them in the future, which is of course; but this kind of cadre transfer also takes a considerable amount of time, and the number is limited, and it is impossible to meet the needs of the basic construction tasks of 1953. Similarly, the construction engineering departments already have many construction tasks in various aspects next year, and these tasks must also be completed. If all departments want to completely rely on the construction departments, they will definitely be disappointed. The result of waiting and relying will inevitably delay basic construction. Not actively transferring manpower from the production sector will definitely suffer.

Second, many production departments are unwilling to transfer excellent cadres, technicians, and skilled workers to the basic construction departments, which is also one of the obstacles. They only understand the importance of production, but they do not understand the importance of basic construction. They do not understand that the number of problems and the complexity of problems in basic construction far exceed those in the production sector. Therefore, the strongest forces must be placed in the basic construction sector first. Some people say, will transferring personnel from the production sector cause production to collapse? Our answer is: No. Because in the past three years, a large number of cadres and technicians have emerged in the production sector, and they can continue to do a good job in production. Transferring manpower from production does not mean neglecting production. Anshan Iron and Steel Company is a good example for us in this regard. They have already transferred a large number of personnel to the basic construction sector this spring, but production is still proceeding as usual; not only that, but new forces have grown in their production sector, and a large number of new cadres have been trained and promoted, and they have overfulfilled the production tasks. Based on practical experience, we can confidently say that the production departments are fully capable and must continuously transfer excellent personnel to the basic construction sector in large numbers. If basic construction is done well, production will never collapse. Those who put production and basic construction in opposition or reverse the order of importance are completely wrong.

Third, obstacles are also manifested in the fact that some cadres and technicians are unwilling to switch from production departments to basic construction departments. Some are unwilling to change careers, some think the responsibility is too heavy, some are afraid that there are too many and too complex problems, and some are afraid of suffering. These ideas are obviously wrong. People with these ideas are afraid of difficulties, lack the tenacious spirit and confidence to overcome difficulties, and lack the enthusiasm for pursuing new things. They still cannot see that after the start of large-scale economic construction in our country, it will further rejuvenate the face of our lives. When the broad masses of the people have already created a new life and made each person's own life shine brightly, those who hesitate and fear in the face of new things today must become laggards.

It must be pointed out that increasing the strength of basic construction is not allowed nor should it be blind, but must be carried out in a planned, step-by-step, and led manner. Departments should plan to transfer personnel, train personnel, and expand fixed workers, otherwise they will be caught off guard and will cause serious losses and waste.

The task of large-scale economic construction facing us is a serious political task. We must mobilize the strength of the people of the whole country to ensure the completion of this task, and first of all, we must ensure the rapid increase in the strength of basic construction and complete the basic construction tasks of 1953. Cadres participating in economic work must use all their strength to learn the technology of basic construction and the methods of managing basic construction. Every Communist Party member must give full play to the exemplary role of the vanguard in carrying out this great task.

We all remember that the Central Committee of our Party, as early as March 13, 1949, in the resolution of the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee, pointed out: "Regarding the issue of restoring and developing production... our comrades must use all their strength to learn the technology of production and the methods of managing production." On July 1 of the same year, Comrade Mao Zedong taught us again in "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship": "Serious economic construction tasks are placed before us. Some of the things we are familiar with are about to become idle, and some of the things we are not familiar with are forcing us to do." "We must learn things we do not understand ourselves." "Delve into it, a few months, a year or two, three years or five years, we can always learn it." "The CPSU is our best teacher, we must learn from the CPSU." Now is the time for us to strive to realize Comrade Mao Zedong's instructions and complete the serious economic construction tasks. We have many superior conditions, abundant resources and potential, and the help of the great Soviet Union, which is extremely valuable.

We believe that, just like the achievements of our country's recovery work in the past three years, we will certainly be able to and must gloriously complete the large-scale construction tasks in the future, so that our great motherland will rapidly embark on the road of industrialization, so that our country's industrial production can not only improve the utilization rate of equipment in existing enterprises, and greatly improve labor productivity by relying on the improvement of the technical proficiency of workers, the promotion of advanced experience, and the improvement of labor organization; and also, because some existing enterprises have been expanded and renovated, and large-scale new enterprises have been put into production one after another, our country's industrial production in the future can continue to grow.

### 把基本建设放在首要地位

    把基本建设放在首要地位
    目前我国国民经济的恢复阶段即将宣告结束，新的大规模的建设即将开始。今后我国的建设，其规模是空前的，我们要完成过去几十年的工作量。我国前所未有的规模巨大的对于我国工业化有决定意义的某些复杂的现代化企业，将在今后逐渐地建设起来。这些企业建立的迟早，将决定我国工业化的程度和速度。这是一个空前复杂的艰巨的新任务。
    为了使我国的工业生产能够以较快的速度不断增长起来，这就要求我们进行规模巨大的基本建设工作。三年来国家对于基本建设的投资是逐年增加的，明年基本建设的投资又将比今年增加很多，其中工业投资将增加更多。因此，基本建设在整个工作中的比重，已经起了根本的变化，基本建设工作在整个国家工作中就被提到了首要的地位。我们能不能建设一个工业化的国家，首先要看我们是否能够保证基本建设的成功。一切忽视基本建设的观点和做法，都必须受到严格的批判。
    当然，我们的基本建设工作不是没有困难和矛盾的。基本建设的主要矛盾是它的任务十分重大，而我们的力量还十分薄弱。无论地质勘探的力量、设计的力量和施工的力量，都远不能满足大规模建设的需要，有的相差一倍二倍甚至几十倍。个别单位的基本建设任务很重，但是基本建设的机构还没有建立起来。这种严重情况是不容许继续下去的。
    我们的基本建设力量为什么会这样弱呢？这是因为过去三年间，我们在全国范围内还忙于土地改革、镇压反革命和抗美援朝。我国所有的经济部门，过去主要的任务是恢复生产和进行生产改革。过去也有一些基本建设，但只是一些恢复与改造的工程。领导机关和干部的注意力，过去不能不集中在生产方面，这在当时的情况下是适当的。但在今天，如果我们继续这样做就不适当了。现在我们必须把基本建设的工作提到首要的地位。我们需要立即把最优秀的干部、技术人员和技术工人投入基本建设部门（包括地质部门），迅速地增长基本建设的力量，以便肩负起大规模经济建设的任务。把基本建设放在首要地位，这必须成为今后全国共同执行的方针。我们必须努力贯彻这个方针，否则一切都是空话。
    要贯彻这一方针，我们必须反对两种错误倾向。一种是左的冒进倾向。这是不懂得基本建设工程的复杂性，把新建工程看成是轻而易举的。这些人以为只要上级批准投资，新建工程就能完成，把建立现代化的工厂看成像开办一个手工工场那样的容易，把新建工厂看成像接管时期维持工厂生产那样的简单，因此既不周密设计，也不准确施工，结果，出现了广州那样完全无用的肥料工厂，在全国各地造成了许多返工浪费现象。这种错误经过去年的检讨，有了改正，但随着出现的是另一种属于右的保守倾向。它的表现是在设计用料时，只求安全，不惜浪费材料，把“没有设计，不准施工”看成可以拖延建设。这两种倾向都是错误的。我们必须继续反对左的冒进倾向，同时又必须反对右的保守倾向。
    克服基本建设工作中任务重大和力量薄弱这一矛盾的关键，在于迅速增长基本建设力量，在于迅速增长地质勘探力量、设计力量和施工力量。这样才有可能克服投资用不完、年年完不成基本建设任务和工程质量低劣的严重现象。
    增长基本建设力量，这就是说要有计划地举办各种专业学院，举办各种专科学校，举办各种技术学校，举办各种短期训练班以及在各种基本建设工程队中用带徒弟的办法来培养各种技术人员和各种技术工人。这些是必须做的，而且有的已经开始做了，当然还要尽最大的可能来做。但是这些力量不是一年半载就能生长起来的。因此在目前为了迎接一九五三年繁重的基本建设任务，必须立即按照中央人民政府政务院财政经济委员会基本建设会议上所规定的办法，积极地从生产方面抽调人员。这在目前来说是最大量而且是最可靠的增长基本建设力量的方法。
    当然，从生产方面抽调优秀的干部、技术人员和技术工人到基本建设方面，是不会没有障碍的。但是这些障碍是必须克服的。这些障碍已经表现出来的有以下三个方面：
    第一，有些部门在基本建设工作中存在着等待和依赖思想。如有的在等待人事部门给他们分配干部，自己却不肯迅速地积极地从所属的生产部门中抽调干部；有的想依赖建筑工程部门替他们施工，自己却不肯积极地去组织和扩大施工的队伍。人事部门已经分配一批干部到基本建设部门中去了，今后还会继续分配出去，这是当然的；但是这种干部的调配，也需要相当的时间，数量也有限，不可能满足一九五三年基本建设任务的需要。同样，建筑工程部门明年度已有许多方面的建筑任务，这些任务也是必须完成的，如果各部门想完全依赖建筑部门，那是一定会落空的。等待与依赖的结果，必然是耽误了基本建设。不积极地从生产方面抽调人力，就一定要吃亏。
    第二，有许多生产部门不肯把优秀的干部、技术人员和技术工人输送到基本建设部门中去，这也是障碍之一。他们只懂得生产的重要，却不懂得基本建设的重要。他们不了解基本建设中问题之多和问题之复杂，远远超过生产方面。因此，首先必须把最强的力量放在基本建设方面。有人说，从生产方面抽调人员，这难道不会使生产垮台吗？我们的回答是：不会的。因为我们三年来在生产方面已经有大批的干部和技术人员涌现出来了，他们能够继续很好地搞好生产。从生产中抽调人力，这决不是忽视生产。鞍山钢铁公司在这一点上是我们很好的榜样。他们在今年春季已经大批地向基本建设方面输送人员，生产却仍然在照常地进行；不但这样，而且他们的生产方面，又生长了新的力量，培养和提拔了大批新的干部，超额完成了生产任务。根据实际经验，我们可以肯定地说，生产部门完全能够而且必须大批地和不断地向基本建设方面输送优秀的人员。把基本建设做好了，生产就永远不会垮台。那些把生产和基本建设对立起来或轻重倒置的思想是完全错误的。
    第三，障碍还表现在某些干部和技术人员不愿意从生产部门转向基本建设部门。有的不愿意改行，有的认为责任太重，有的怕问题太多太复杂，有的怕受苦。这些想法显然也都是错误的。有这些想法的人，都因为他们害怕困难，缺乏顽强的克服困难的精神和信心，对于新鲜事物缺乏追求的热情。他们现在还看不到我国大规模经济建设开始之后，就将进一步使我国生活的面貌焕然一新。当着广大人民已经创造出新的生活，并使每个人自己的生活发出了耀眼的光辉的时候，今天在新事物面前犹豫害怕的人就一定要成为落伍者。
    必须指出，增长基本建设力量，不允许也不应该是盲目的，而必须按照计划有步骤有领导地进行。抽调人员、训练人员以及扩大固定工人，各部门都应该有计划地进行，否则手忙脚乱，将会造成严重的损失和浪费。
    摆在我们面前的大规模经济建设的任务，是一个严重的政治任务。我们必须动员全国人民的力量，来保证这个任务的完成，首先要保证迅速地增长基本建设的力量，完成一九五三年的基本建设任务。参加经济工作的干部要用全力去学习基本建设的技术和管理基本建设的方法。每一个共产党员在执行这个伟大的任务中，更必须高度地发挥先锋的模范的作用。
    我们都记得，我们党的中央，还在一九四九年三月十三日第七届二中全会的决议中，就已经指出：“关于恢复和发展生产的问题，……我们的同志必须用全力去学习生产的技术和管理生产的方法”。同年七月一日，毛泽东同志在“论人民民主专政”中又教导我们：“严重的经济建设任务摆在我们面前。我们熟习的东西有些快要闲起来了，我们不熟习的东西正在强迫我们去做。”“我们必须学会自己不懂的东西。”“钻进去，几个月，一年两年，三年五年，总可以学会的。”“联共就是我们的最好的先生，我们必须向联共学习。”现在正是我们努力实现毛泽东同志的指示，去完成严重的经济建设任务的时候了。我们有许多优越的条件，有丰富的资源和潜力，有伟大苏联的帮助，这是极为可贵的。
    我们相信，如同三年来我国恢复工作的成就一样，我们一定能够并且必须光荣地去完成今后大规模建设的任务，使我们的伟大祖国迅速地走上工业化的道路，使我国的工业生产不但能够在原有企业中，提高设备利用率，并依靠工人群众技术熟练程度的提高、先进经验的推广和劳动组织的改善，大大提高劳动的生产率；而且由于部分原有企业经过扩充、改建和大规模新建企业陆续投入生产，使我国今后工业生产能够不断地增长起来。
