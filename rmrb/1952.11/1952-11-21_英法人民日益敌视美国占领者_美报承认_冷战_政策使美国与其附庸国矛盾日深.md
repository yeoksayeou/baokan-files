Xinhua News Agency, November 20th: TASS, New York, November 18th: The "New York Times" published dispatches from London and Bordeaux on the front page, both reporting on the hostile sentiments of the British and French people towards the American occupiers – the American troops stationed in their countries.

The "New York Times" correspondent in London, Daniel, said: This hostility is the result of the large number of American troops stationed in Britain. Daniel also pointed out that, according to American soldiers, British citizens sometimes throw cigarette butts at cars when American vehicles pass by, and they gather and shout abuse when they see Americans entering public places. Therefore, conflicts often occur, and sometimes they even lead to fights. An American official in London said: "The situation is getting worse and worse."

The "New York Times" correspondent in Bordeaux, Daught, also described the French people's hostility towards the American troops stationed in their country in a dispatch. Daught wrote: "The presence of foreign soldiers on French soil in peacetime hurts the pride of many French people... They may reluctantly admit that foreign troops are necessary. However, observers believe that it is too difficult for them to like this situation." Daught also said: "Between 12,000 and 15,000 American soldiers and airmen are stationed in sixteen camps in Bordeaux, La Rochelle, and other places. Their daily comings and goings cause many unpleasant and misunderstood incidents..."

According to American military officers, there were as many as 312 "serious incidents" involving American soldiers last year.

Xinhua News Agency, November 20th: TASS, New York, November 18th: American newspapers are publishing more and more news revealing the United States' concern about the growing economic difficulties caused by its "Cold War" policy in the capitalist world. These reports meaningfully acknowledge the existence of deepening contradictions between the United States and other countries.

The "New York Times" pointed out: The Japanese are striving to protect their economy from the intrusion of American capital and want to get rid of the various restrictions imposed by the Americans on their trade. The "New York Times" said: Japanese textile factory owners are trying to restore their pre-war position in the Far East. The "New York Times" also admitted that the United States' efforts to obstruct trade between Britain and China and the Soviet Union have caused Britain to endure various difficulties.

The "Christian Science Monitor" also acknowledged that Western European countries, due to a sharp decline in exports, will raise new protests to Washington against the United States restricting their trade. The newspaper also pointed out that Western European industrial and commercial giants are urging their governments to reopen negotiations with Washington on the "Eastern trade issue."

Xinhua News Agency, November 19th: According to TASS, Moscow, November 15th: Izvestia commentator Vronsky commented on the infighting within the imperialist camp, saying that the increasingly frequent complaints and mutual accusations in the camp of American aggressors are sufficient proof that the "unity" between the member states of this group is breaking down. The situation in which the member states of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization discussed the 1953 rearmament plan particularly highlighted the differences between them. The alliance's Standing Council sent all member states a "questionnaire" on next year's rearmament plan, asking them to reply before August 31. Although the deadline has long passed, most member states have not yet replied, and it is not known whether they intend not to reply at all. The US government was the first to fail to comply with the requirements of the Standing Council, leaving many questions blank. This has aroused serious protests from other members of the North Atlantic Alliance.

Vronsky continued: The more the United States puts pressure on its partners in the imperialist group, the more these partners want to get rid of the oppression of American imperialism and gain their own independent status. According to Smith, director of the European division of the American International News Service, American military and diplomats have hinted that if France is unwilling to implement the plan to organize a "European Army," the "only option" would be to organize a German army closely aligned with the American army. The French were very angry when they heard these hints. Vronsky concluded: The intensification of contradictions within the North Atlantic aggressive bloc has manifested itself in all aspects of relations between the member states of the aggressive bloc.

    英法人民日益敌视美国占领者
    美报承认“冷战”政策使美国与其附庸国矛盾日深
    【新华社二十日讯】塔斯社纽约十八日讯：“纽约时报”在第一版登载了伦敦和波尔多寄来的通讯，这两篇通讯都是报道英法两国人民对于美国占领者——驻在他们国内的美国军队——的敌视情绪的。
    “纽约时报”驻伦敦记者但尼尔说：这种敌视情形是庞大的美国军队驻在英国的结果。但尼尔并且指出：据美国士兵说，英国市民有时在美国汽车开过的时候，对车厢投掷香烟头，他们在公共场所中看到美国人进去，就会聚集起来，口出恶言。因此时常发生冲突，有时还会打起来。美国驻伦敦的一个官员说：“情况是越来越坏了。”
    “纽约时报”驻波尔多记者道特在一篇通讯里面也叙述了法国人民敌视驻在他们国内的美军的情况。道特写道：“外国士兵在和平时期留驻法国国土，使许多法国人的自尊心受到了伤害……他们可能勉强地承认外国驻军是必要的。然而，观察家相信，要他们喜欢这种事情却是太困难了。”道特又说：“有一万二千到一万五千名美国士兵和空军人员分驻在波尔多和拉罗歇尔等地的十六个兵营里，他们每天出出进进，都要引起许多不愉快和误会的事情。……”
    据美国军官说：去年一年涉及美国士兵的“严重事件”就有三百十二起之多。
    【新华社二十日讯】塔斯社纽约十八日讯：美国各报发表的消息，愈来愈多地透露出美国对于它的“冷战”政策在资本主义世界内所引起的不断增长的经济困难感到忧虑的迹象。这些消息意味深长地承认美国与其他国家之间存在日益加深的矛盾。
    “纽约时报”指出：日本人正力求保护自己的经济，不让美国资本侵入日本，并想摆脱美国人对他们的贸易所加上的种种限制。“纽约时报”说：日本的纺织工厂厂主，正竭力恢复他们战前在远东的地位。“纽约时报”并且承认，由于美国竭力阻挠英国与中国和苏联贸易，已使英国经受种种困难。
    “基督教科学箴言报”也承认，西欧各国由于出口锐减，将对华盛顿重新提出抗议，反对美国使它们的贸易受到限制。这个报纸并且指出：西欧的工商业巨子正力促本国政府与华盛顿就“东方贸易问题”重开谈判。
    【新华社十九日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科十五日讯：“消息报”评论员佛隆斯基评论帝国主义阵营内部的争吵说，在美国侵略者阵营中，日益频繁的抱怨和互相指责的声音，足以证明这个集团成员国之间的“团结”正在破裂。北大西洋公约组织的成员国讨论一九五三年重整军备计划的情况特别突出地说明了它们之间的分歧。该联盟的常设理事会发给所有成员国一份关于明年整军计划的“询问表”，要它们在八月三十一日以前答复。虽然规定的时间已过了很久，但大多数成员国都还未答复，也不知道它们是否打算根本就不答复。美国政府首先就不执行常设理事会的要求，把许多问题空起来不加答复。这已引起了北大西洋联盟的其他成员国的严重抗议。
    佛隆斯基接着写道：美国越是对它的帝国主义集团的伙伴加压力，这些伙伴就越想摆脱美帝国主义的压迫而获得自己的独立地位。据美国国际新闻社欧洲分社社长史密斯报道说，美国军人和外交家曾暗示，如果法国不愿意执行组织“欧洲军”的计划，“唯一的选择”就只有组织与美国军队密切联合的德国军队。法国人听到这些暗示非常恼怒。佛隆斯基最后写道：北大西洋侵略集团间矛盾的加剧，已经表现在侵略集团成员国之间各方面的关系上。
