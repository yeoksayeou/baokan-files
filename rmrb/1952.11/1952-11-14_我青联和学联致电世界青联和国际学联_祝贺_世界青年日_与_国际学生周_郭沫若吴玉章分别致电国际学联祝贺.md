Xinhua News Agency Report: On the eve of "World Youth Day" (November 10th) and "International Students' Week" (November 10th - 17th), the All-China Federation of Democratic Youth and the All-China Students' Federation sent telegrams to the World Federation of Democratic Youth and the International Union of Students. The telegram to the World Federation of Democratic Youth said: On the occasion of "World Youth Day", we extend warm greetings to peace-loving youth all over the world, and congratulate the World Federation of Democratic Youth on its seventh anniversary and the great victories it has achieved in uniting youth to defend peace and youth rights.

The telegram to the International Union of Students said: We will do our best to support the various activities of the International Union of Students, and are willing to unite more closely with peace-loving students all over the world to advance towards peace, national independence and democratic education.

The All-China Federation of Democratic Youth and the All-China Students' Federation sent a telegram to the Soviet Youth Anti-Fascist Committee saying: Chinese youth sincerely congratulate Soviet youth on their new and greater achievements in completing the historic tasks set forth by the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and in the struggle to build communism and defend world peace.

The All-China Federation of Democratic Youth and the All-China Students' Federation jointly wrote a letter to Japanese youth and students on the 9th, saying: On the occasion of commemorating "World Youth Day" and "International Students' Week", we, on behalf of the youth and students of China, extend brotherly greetings to the Japanese youth and students who are heroically fighting for national independence, democracy, and freedom! Chinese youth and students resolutely oppose the US imperialism's conspiracy to rearm Japan, revive Japanese militarism, and turn Japan into a base for launching aggressive wars in the Far East. We firmly believe that as long as Japanese youth and students fight heroically together with the people of the whole country, they will eventually establish an independent, democratic, free and peaceful Japan.

[Another Dispatch] In commemoration of "World Youth Day" (November 10th) and "International Students' Week" (November 10th to 17th), Guo Moruo, Chairman of the China Peace Committee, and Wu Yuzhang, President of the Renmin University of China, sent congratulatory telegrams and messages to the International Union of Students respectively.

Wu Yuzhang wished in his telegram that students all over the world would achieve greater success in improving their study and living conditions, striving for democratic education and national independence, and defending world lasting peace.
