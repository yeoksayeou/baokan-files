The safety and hygiene inspection of the first batch of 183 state-owned, local state-owned, and joint state-private factories in Shanghai, which began at the end of July, was completed by the end of September. During the mass inspection, employees put forward more than 460,000 suggestions for improving safety and hygiene, of which about 60% were resolved by the workers themselves. Now, the working conditions of more than 140,000 industrial workers in these factories have been greatly improved, and work-related injuries have been significantly reduced.

The East China District and Shanghai Municipal leading bodies attached great importance to this safety and hygiene inspection. The East China Industrial Department specifically dispatched five deputy ministers, eighteen bureau chiefs and section chiefs, and forty-four section heads to go deep into their respective factories to assist in the work. Leading departments at all levels required factories to complete this safety and hygiene inspection as the primary task that must be completed for production reform, and to thoroughly eliminate the old management methods of not paying attention to worker safety left over from imperialism and bureaucratic capitalism. Therefore, the mobilization of employees in various factories was relatively thorough, and they universally participated in this inspection. During the inspection, each factory meticulously inspected every machine, every belt, and even every screw on the machine, truly achieving "everyone inspects, everywhere inspects."

The problems exposed during the inspection deeply educated the employees of various factories. After the launch of the safety and hygiene inspection campaign, workers, through calculating "accident accounts," found the root causes of neglecting safety and hygiene. This was the result of the long-term cruel rule of imperialism and bureaucratic capitalism, who did not treat workers as human beings. Therefore, under the harsh working conditions of the old society, almost every old worker had scars, and workers had become accustomed to this. In this safety and hygiene inspection, the workers criticized the wrong ideas and naturally thought that after liberation they had become the masters of the enterprise and the machines, and should pay attention to safe production. Because this is not just a matter of the worker’s personal safety, but also directly affects production. For example, the eleven workers in the acid bleaching group of the bleaching department of the State-owned Shanghai No. 1 Printing and Dyeing Factory, in the "accounting meeting" recalled that in the past, because they did not pay attention to safe production and did not control the speed of the hexagon plate, they produced more than 2,600 pieces of substandard cloth in one year, causing huge losses to the country. Workers also reviewed their old operating habits that were contrary to safe production. After this education, the old workers, workers, and apprentices in various factories, based on their respective work experience, put forward what points should be paid attention to in production, where the machines are prone to problems, and initially formulated various safe operating systems, and guaranteed to implement them as production discipline.

After the safety and hygiene inspection, the one-sided production viewpoints of some factory and enterprise leading cadres were also strictly criticized. Many leading cadres made profound self-criticisms to the workers and went deep into the site to understand the situation, realizing that safety and doing a good job in production are inseparable. For example, Wang Yimin, the deputy manager of the Shanghai Ferry Company, after inspecting the workers' working environment and working conditions, said to the workers: "No matter how much money the ventilation equipment costs, no matter whether the ship looks good or not after the windows are opened, as long as it can protect everyone's health, the company will definitely do it."

In the "accident account" calculation, the workers of various factories analyzed the causes of accidents and believed that 80% to 90% of the accidents could be prevented. Therefore, they took the initiative to solve the safety and hygiene problems. Some did not cost money, and some cost very little. The competent departments of various enterprises and the factory administration immediately solved the necessary and possible safety equipment, even though they cost more money; Those that could not be solved for the time being but could be solved in the future were also planned and completed within a time limit; A few that could not be completed at present were also explained clearly to the workers. The East China Industrial Department alone has allocated and approved more than 32 billion yuan for its 46 affiliated factories to improve equipment. In this way, the workers' suggestions were "every item has a place to land, and every point has an explanation."

Through the great inspection, the workers' working conditions have been greatly improved. Safety protection devices have been installed on the rotating parts, power machinery, etc. of each machine in each factory, the machines have been generally overhauled, and temperature reduction equipment and lighting equipment have been added to the workshops. According to the statistics of ten factories, including Huatong Electric Motor Factory, in addition to many protection devices installed by workers using waste materials, the administrative side has added more than 600 relatively large protection devices, and has started to build eleven dormitories, seven canteens, seven bathrooms, and thirty-two toilets. The special problems existing in factories of different industrial natures have also been basically solved. In the lime workshops of Tianyuan and Tianli Electrochemical Plants, lime has been flying around for more than 20 years since the plant was built. Workers were often poisoned and suffered from tracheitis when operating. The administrative side of the factory adopted the workers' suggestions this time, purchased submersible "special work clothes" for the workers, and buried very long iron pipes under the floor of the workshop to transport fresh air.

After the safety and hygiene inspection, work-related accidents in various factories have generally begun to decrease. In the past, the sizing, steel wire, and cotton cleaning workshops of the State-owned Shanghai No. 6 Cotton Textile Factory, where accidents frequently occurred, have not had any accidents in the past two months. The number of sick workers has been decreasing day by day, and the absenteeism rate of the whole factory has dropped from 13% to 10%, and the lowest time it dropped to 7%. During the safety inspection, almost every factory discovered and solved many accidents that could occur in production, and the State-owned Shanghai No. 1 Printing and Dyeing Factory prevented 22 cases. For example, the factory found during the inspection that the cracks in the boiler cavity were already very large, and there was a risk of explosion at any time. The State-owned Shanghai Silk Spinning Factory originally thought that the machines were very good, but the inspection found that the machines were missing screws and the screws were loose, etc. These accidents that could have occurred were prevented in time.

Now, the second batch of state-owned, local state-owned, and joint state-private factories in Shanghai has initially launched a safety and hygiene inspection.

    上海部分国营及公私合营工厂
    安全卫生大检查获巨大成绩
    上海市首批一百八十三个国营、地方国营、公私合营工厂的安全卫生大检查，从七月底开始到九月底已全部结束。在群众性的大检查中，职工提出改进安全卫生工作的意见达四十六万余件，其中百分之六十左右，又都由工人自己动手予以解决。现在，这些工厂中十四万余产业工人的劳动条件已有很大改善，工伤事故显著减少。
    华东区及上海市领导机关十分重视此次安全卫生大检查，华东工业部专门抽出了五个副部长、十八个局长和处长、四十四个科长，分别深入到所属各厂协助工作。各级领导部门要求各厂，把这次安全卫生大检查当作生产改革必须经过的首要任务来完成，彻底肃清帝国主义、官僚资本主义遗留下来的不重视工人安全的旧的经营管理的方法。因此，各厂职工群众发动的比较深入，普遍参加了这次检查。各厂在检查中都细致地检查每部机器、每根皮带、甚至机器上的每颗螺丝，真正做到“人人检查、处处检查”。
    从检查中暴露的问题，深深地教育了各厂职工。安全卫生大检查运动开展以后，工人经过算“事故账”，找出了不重视安全卫生的根源，这是帝国主义、官僚资本主义长期残酷统治的结果，他们不把工人当人看待。因此在旧社会的恶劣的劳动条件下，几乎每一个老工人都有伤疤，工人对这已习以为常。在这次安全卫生大检查中，工人批判了错误的思想，很自然地想起在解放后自己已变成了企业和机器的主人，应该重视安全生产。因为这不只是对工人个人的安全问题，而且也直接影响生产。如国营上海第一印染厂漂拣部漂酸小组中的十一个工人，在算账会上回忆过去因为不注意安全生产，对六角盘的速度不加控制，一年来就生产了次布二千六百余匹，给国家造成巨大的损失。工人也纷纷检讨了自己过去与安全生产相违背的旧的操作习惯。经过这次教育，各厂的老工人、工人、学徒，都根据各自的工作经验，提出在生产上要注意那几点，机器上那些地方容易出毛病，初步订出各种安全操作制度，并保证当作生产纪律来执行。
    在安全卫生大检查以后，有些工厂、企业领导干部的片面生产观点，也受到了严格的批评。许多领导干部向工人群众作了深刻的检讨，并深入现场了解情况，认识到安全和搞好生产不可分。如上海市轮渡公司的副经理王一民在检查了工人的劳动环境和劳动条件以后向工人说：“不管通风设备要花多少钱，不管开了窗后船好看不好看，只要能保护大家的健康，公司一定照办。”
    各厂工人在算“事故账”中，分析了事故发生的原因，认为百分之八、九十的事故都是可以防止的。因此纷纷自己动手解决安全卫生问题。有的没有花钱，有的花钱很少。各企业主管部门和工厂行政方面，对必需的和可能办到的安全设备，虽然花钱较多，也即时予以解决；一时不能解决而将来可能解决的，也都作好了计划，限期完成，少数目前确实不能完成者，也向工人讲解清楚。仅华东工业部已拨发和批准所属四十六个厂改进设备的费用，就有三百二十亿余元。这样，工人提出的意见便做到了“件件有着落、条条有交代”。
    通过大检查，工人的劳动条件已获得很大改善。各厂每一部机器的皮带、齿轮等转动部分、动力机械，都已装设好安全防护装置，机器已普遍进行了检修，车间都添设了降低温度设备和照明设备。据华通电机厂等十个厂的统计，除工人用废料装设的许多防护装置外，行政方面已增加了比较大的防护装置共六百多件，并动工增建了宿舍十一所、食堂七所、浴室七所、厕所三十二所。不同产业性质的工厂所存在的特殊问题，也基本上得到了解决。天原、天利电化厂的石灰车间里，建厂二十多年来都是石灰飞扬，工人操作时，皮鼻中毒和患气管炎的很多。该厂行政方面这次采纳了工人的建议，给工人购置了潜水式“特种工作服”，并在车间地下埋置了很长的铁管输送新鲜空气。
    经过安全卫生大检查，各厂的工伤事故已普遍开始减少。国营上海第六棉纺织厂过去经常发生事故的浆纱、钢丝、清花等车间，两个月来已没有发生事故。工人生病的逐日减少，全厂的缺勤率由百分之十三降到百分之十，最低时降到百分之七。在安全检查中，差不多每个厂都发现和解决了不少生产上可能发生的事故，国营上海第一印染厂就防止了二十二件。如该厂在检查中发现锅炉腔内的裂缝已经很大，随时都有爆炸的危险。国营上海绢纺厂原以为机器很好，但检查中发现机器上缺螺丝、螺丝松脱等现象很严重。这些可能发生的事故，都得到了及时的防止。
    现在，上海市第二批国营、地方国营、公私合营的工厂安全卫生大检查，已初步展开。
