Xinhua News Agency, 1st: People from all walks of life in Beijing are warmly welcoming the arrival of "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month."

    Workers at the Shijingshan Power Plant, which has made significant achievements in promoting advanced Soviet experiences, are preparing to launch a production competition centered on celebrating the Soviet October Revolution Day and strengthening Sino-Soviet friendship work. Workers at the Changxindian Railway Factory, with its glorious history, are also preparing to launch a "Complete Red" competition during "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month." The competition requires the application of high-speed cutting methods to more than five kinds of workpieces and the prioritized promotion of the Soviet Zhendarova method (a method where each process guarantees good product quality) in the welding department. Factories, mines, and enterprises such as Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, Beijing Garment Factory, and Beijing Postal Administration are all preparing to use "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month" to launch a wave of learning from advanced Soviet experiences among the vast number of employees, and to further introduce the great achievements of the Soviet people in various fields, as well as to conduct communist ideological education.

    Various mass organizations in the suburban rural areas, as well as rural theater troupes, clapper talk groups, waist drum teams, rooftop broadcasters, slide projection teams, and other propaganda organizations have been mobilized. They are preparing to carry out large-scale propaganda activities during "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month" to conduct internationalist education on Sino-Soviet friendship and education on the socialist future for the broad masses of farmers. Fengtai District is also preparing to hold farmer symposiums, using the agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams in the district as the backbone, to exchange experiences in organizing collective production.

    The preparatory work for universities, specialized schools, secondary schools, and primary schools to welcome "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month" is underway. Many young students are actively browsing books and magazines containing articles and pictures about Soviet construction and communications and novels describing the heroic deeds of the Soviet people. They are determined to take the noble communist morality of the Soviet people as their example and constantly improve themselves to better serve the motherland. In addition to preparing to hold celebration meetings, evening parties, bonfire parties, perform dramas, operas, Peking operas, and perform dances during "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month," schools are also preparing to hold various academic lectures and seminars introducing the Soviet Union.

    The Beijing business community is also preparing to actively participate in the activities of "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month." They have already organized more than 2,000 people to study documents related to Sino-Soviet friendship.

    The people of the capital are greatly excited about the upcoming arrival of the Soviet art and science workers delegation headed by the chairman of the Soviet Peace Committee and famous poet Nikolai Tikhonov, and the Soviet Army Red Flag Song and Dance Ensemble in Beijing.

    People have prepared all the specific welcoming work and are warmly awaiting the arrival of Soviet friends.

Xinhua News Agency, 1st: Beijing's Sino-Soviet friendship work has achieved great accomplishments in the past three years. The organizations of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association have spread throughout the city's factories, mines, enterprises, government agencies, schools, streets, shops, and suburban rural areas, with a total membership of more than 552,000 people. The Beijing Sino-Soviet Friendship Association and its grassroots organizations regularly and systematically screen films, issue books, hold report meetings, and run Russian language broadcast lectures and Russian evening schools, etc., to carry out Sino-Soviet friendship propaganda and education work. In addition, some Sino-Soviet Friendship Association branches in Xisi District and Xuanwu District have also established a "Sino-Soviet Friendship Day" system, where members meet once a month to discuss issues related to carrying out Sino-Soviet friendship work.

    The people of Beijing have made many achievements in learning from the advanced experiences of the Soviet Union in various aspects of construction. The Shijingshan Power Plant implemented advanced Soviet production experiences such as the rapid maintenance method, scientific roving inspection method, and burning low-value coal. It made tremendous achievements in the increase production and practice economy movement. In the third quarter of 1952 alone, they increased production and saved wealth equivalent to 8.1 billion yuan for the country. The Beijing Machine Factory greatly improved production efficiency after adopting high-speed cutting methods. The North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory completed its 1952 production tasks two months ahead of schedule due to the adoption of the advanced Soviet management method of organizing rhythmic production according to instruction charts. Advanced Soviet agricultural experiences have also begun to be widely promoted in state-owned farms and among many farmers in the suburbs. The state-owned Shuangqiao Farm adopted the Soviet wide-row close planting method for planting wheat, and the yield per mu was more than 120 jin higher than that of wheat planted using the old method. Medical workers in the capital are also comprehensively promoting organized treatment methods and painless childbirth methods. The people of the capital also deeply love Soviet novels and movies. Reading Soviet novels and watching Soviet movies has become an indispensable part of the cultural life of the people of the capital. The heroic and model deeds of the Soviet people have also become a force encouraging the people of Beijing to move forward; many school students paste photos of Zoya and Shura in their diaries, and some even write "Learn from Zoya" on slips of paper and paste them on their desks. Some students initially disliked science and engineering courses, but after reading "The Story of Zoya and Shura," they realized that not studying hard is irresponsible to the motherland, so they worked hard to study. In order to better learn from the advanced experiences of the Soviet Union in various fields, a wave of learning Russian has also been launched among the people of the capital; according to extremely incomplete statistics, there are currently more than 28,700 people in the city learning Russian in their spare time.

    北京各界紧张进行准备工作
    热烈迎接“中苏友好月”
    北京市中苏友好工作三年来成就很大
    【新华社一日讯】北京各界人民，热烈地迎接着“中苏友好月”的到来。
    推广苏联先进经验有显著成绩的石景山发电厂的工人，准备以庆祝苏联十月革命节、加强中苏友好工作为内容，发动一次生产竞赛。具有光荣历史的长辛店铁路工厂的工人，也准备在“中苏友好月”内开展“满堂红”竞赛；在竞赛中要求把高速切削法运用到五种以上的工作物上去，并有重点地在电焊部门推行苏联真达罗娃工作法（就是每一工序都保证产品质量好的方法）。石景山钢铁厂、北京被服厂、北京邮政管理局等各工厂、矿山、企业都准备通过“中苏友好月”，在广大职工中间，掀起一个学习苏联先进经验的热潮，并进一步介绍苏联人民各方面的伟大成就，和进行一次共产主义的思想教育。
    郊区农村的各种群众组织及农村剧团、快板组、腰鼓队、屋顶广播员、幻灯队等各种宣传机构都已经动员起来，他们准备在“中苏友好月”内展开大规模的宣传活动，对广大农民进行一次中苏友好的国际主义教育和社会主义前途的教育。丰台区还准备以本区的农业生产合作社和互助组为骨干，召开农民座谈会，交流组织起来进行集体生产的经验。
    各大学、专科学校、中等学校和小学迎接“中苏友好月”的准备工作，正在紧张地进行着。很多年轻的学生们积极地翻阅着刊载有关苏联建设的文章、图片的书籍杂志和描写苏联人民英雄事迹的通讯和小说，他们决心以苏联人民高贵的共产主义道德为自己的榜样，不断地提高自己，以便更好的为祖国服务。各学校除了准备在“中苏友好月”内举行庆祝会、晚会、营火会、演出话剧、歌剧、京剧和表演舞蹈等活动外；还准备举行介绍苏联的各种学术讲座和座谈会。
    北京工商界也准备热烈参加“中苏友好月”的活动，他们已经组织了两千多人，学习有关中苏友好的文件。
    首都人民对于以苏联拥护和平委员会主席、名诗人吉洪诺夫为首的苏联艺术科学工作者代表团和苏军红旗歌舞团即将来到北京，感到莫大的兴奋。
    人们已经把各项具体的迎接工作准备就绪，热情地等待着苏联朋友们的到来。
    【新华社一日讯】北京市的中苏友好工作三年来有很大的成就。中苏友好协会的组织已遍布于全市工厂、矿山、企业、机关、学校、街道、商店及郊区农村中，会员总数已达五十五万二千多人。北京市中苏友好协会和它的基层组织，经常有计划地放映电影、印发图书、举行报告会，并开办俄语广播讲座和俄文夜校等，进行中苏友好的宣传教育工作。此外，西四区和宣武区有些中苏友好协会支会，还建立了“中苏友好日”的制度，会员们每月集会一次，讨论开展中苏友好工作问题。
    北京市人民，在学习苏联各方面建设的先进经验方面有许多成就。石景山发电厂实行了快速检修法、科学巡回检查法、烧低值煤等苏联先进的生产经验后，使该厂的增产节约运动获得了巨大的成就，仅在一九五二年第三季度内，他们即为国家增产节约等于八十一亿元的财富。北京机器厂采用了高速切削法后，大大地提高了生产效率。华北农业机械总厂，由于采用了苏联的按指示图表组织有节奏生产的先进管理方法，提前两月完成了一九五二年度的生产任务。苏联农业上的先进经验也开始在郊区的国营农场和许多农民中普遍推广。国营双桥农场种植小麦由于采用了苏联的宽垅密植法，每亩产量较用老法子种的小麦多收一百二十多斤。首都的医务工作者，也正在全面推行组织治疗法和无痛分娩法。首都人民也非常热爱苏联的小说、电影，阅读苏联小说、看苏联电影已成为首都人民文化生活中不可少的一部分。苏联人民的英雄模范事迹，也成为鼓励北京人民前进的力量；很多学校的学生把卓娅和舒拉的照片贴在自己的日记本上，有的还写了“学习卓娅”的纸条贴在自己的书桌上。有的学生最初不喜欢理工课程，但读了“卓娅和舒拉的故事”后，认识到不好好学习就是对祖国不负责任，便努力学习起来。为了更好地学习苏联各方面先进经验，学习俄文的热潮也在首都人民中展开；仅据极不完全的统计，目前全市已有二万八千七百多人在业余时间内学习俄文。
