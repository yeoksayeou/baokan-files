    A Prerequisite for Improving Labor Productivity - Rational Labor Organization and Remuneration
    -- Introduction to the Advanced Experience of the China Changchun Railway, No. 9
    Wang Zhaorui, Deputy Director of the Labor and Wages Department of the China Changchun Railway Administration
    Rational labor organization and labor remuneration are one of the prerequisites for improving labor productivity. From the first day of their work, Soviet experts of the China Changchun Railway have begun the following important tasks to achieve rational labor organization and remuneration:
    First, determine the grades of stations, sections, and factories as the primary basis for determining staffing, implementing rational labor remuneration, and correctly allocating cadres. When determining the grades of stations, sections, and factories, the specific scores for each job are determined based on the amount of each type of work, the condition of equipment, and the major and minor conditions of the region to determine the grade. For example, for stations: stations with a standard of 35 points or more are designated as special-class stations, 20.35 points as first-class stations, 14.2 points as second-class stations, 10 to 14 points as third-class stations, 5 to 10 points as fourth-class stations, and those below 5 points as fifth-class stations. The same method is used for appraisal in the locomotive, rolling stock, track maintenance, and telecommunications departments. The result is that it not only changes the past situation where the ability of cadres did not match their jobs, but also corrects the past bias of paying less wages in units with large workloads and paying higher wages in smaller units, so that the staffing work has a basis.
    Second, determine the staffing of management personnel every year. Since 1950, the China Changchun Railway has determined the staffing of management personnel three times. In the process of determining staffing, we have deeply realized that we used to only pay attention to completing tasks, and rarely calculated manpower or costs. Soviet comrades fully implemented the spirit of economic accounting, which is to complete the most work with the least manpower, in determining staffing. When it was necessary to add a person, the Soviet comrades told us to first see if the person's work was enough for eight hours. If it was, add them; if not, don't. Under this spirit, we reduced many people who did not work eight hours. The General Affairs Department of the China Changchun Railway Administration used to have a person who filled out service certificates, filling out one or two certificates a day, and sometimes not filling out one for several days (it only takes about ten minutes to fill out one). Therefore, we decided to reduce this person and hand over his work to the person responsible for filling out free tickets. The Shenyang Railway Sub-bureau used to have only ten cars, but needed an electric welder and a lathe worker; it only had a dozen teapots, but needed a tinsmith to repair teapots. The Soviet comrades suggested that these tasks be handed over to the nearby locomotive section for completion, and these people be transferred to where they were needed. When adding a person, the Soviet comrades told us to also see who would be more suitable to do the job. Simpler jobs should not be done by people with technology and culture. In the past, the statistics work in the operations room of the Harbin Locomotive Section was done by drivers and deputy drivers, but this work could be completely done by clerks. In the past, the car inspectors of the Shenyang Rolling Stock Section did not do inspection work, but cooked and stood guard; but the people who cooked and stood guard went to the trains to do inspection work instead. Under the guidance of Soviet comrades, we eliminated this unreasonable phenomenon.
    Reducing redundant personnel and eliminating overlapping institutions is also an important task. Before the establishment of the China Changchun Railway, our locomotive department had dispatch work, the track maintenance department had dispatch work, and the supervision office also had dispatch work. After staffing, we only had dispatch work in the traffic and locomotive departments. In the past, we had the Eighteen O'Clock Report [Note 1] in the transportation department, and the Traffic Technical Office also had the Eighteen O'Clock Report. After staffing, we put all the Eighteen O'Clock Reports in the dispatch office.
    When determining staffing, it should be determined according to the seasonal busy and slack periods. This is also an issue that Soviet comrades pay close attention to. Track maintenance districts, engineering teams, etc., are busier in spring, summer, and autumn, and slacker in winter, but the locomotive section has more work in winter. When determining staffing, this situation should be fully considered and manpower should be appropriately allocated. For example, people who have less work in the summer, such as heating workers, can be transferred to track maintenance and construction work. This can rationally use labor.
    Soviet comrades believe that if there is not much work, and one person can do it, there is no need to set up a deputy position. Setting up a deputy position not only increases expenses for the country, but also increases many levels below. Soviet comrades also believe that management personnel are non-productive personnel, while the personnel who actually produce things are workers. The more management personnel there are, the more paperwork there is, and the more document travel will increase, resulting in a waste of personnel and funds, and increasing troubles for the lower levels. Therefore, it is necessary to reduce management personnel as much as possible in the organs and increase production personnel.
    Because of such personnel appraisal, the staffing of management personnel in each business unit has been reduced compared to the staffing before the establishment of the China Changchun Railway. The Hailar Railway Sub-bureau reduced it by 26.8%, the Harbin Railway Sub-bureau reduced it by 37.8%, the Siping Telecommunications Section reduced it by 75.8%, the Acheng Track Maintenance Section reduced it by 43.9%, the Changchun Track Maintenance Section reduced it by 68%, the Harbin Rolling Stock Section reduced it by 25.9%, the Harbin Locomotive Section reduced it by 87%, and the Ang'angxi Locomotive Section reduced it by 43.6%.
    However, the staffing of the China Changchun Railway employees' cultural and welfare departments has not only not decreased, but has increased. In 1952, the number of personnel in the Medical and Health Department increased by more than 100 compared to 1950. In 1952, the number of personnel in the Livelihood Department increased by 370 compared to 1950. In 1952, the number of personnel working in the canteen increased by 44 compared to 1950. In 1952, the Administration and Sub-bureaus each added a technical safety engineer. In 1952, the number of personnel in the Cultural and Educational Department increased by 109 compared to 1950. In addition, 33 schools and 239 teachers were added, and each sub-bureau was allocated two cultural trains and service personnel.
    Third, determine the staffing of production personnel. Production personnel are determined based on the labor consumption standards, equipment, statutory working hours per person, sick leave, absenteeism, and other conditions of each unit. For example, the monthly plan for washing and inspection tasks in the locomotive section is 100 units, the labor consumption standard per unit is 200 hours, the sickness and absenteeism rate is 2%, and the working hours per person per month are 200 hours. Based on these conditions, the staffing is determined to be 102 people.
    However, due to the promotion of advanced working methods, the improvement of equipment, and the increase in labor productivity in various departments, the labor consumption standards should be adjusted and new staffing should be determined. When formulating staffing in 1952, the labor consumption standard per 1,000 locomotive kilometers [Note 2] for locomotive crew members was adjusted from 1.69 people in 1951 to 1.31 people, and the annual repair labor standard [Note 3] for the rolling stock department was adjusted from 96 man-hours [Note 4] in 1951 to 77 man-hours.
    Fourth, in October 1950, a single wage system for administrative and service management personnel was implemented. This wage system is very rational. Because it stipulates grades based on the size of the unit, the scope of responsibilities, the weight of responsibilities, and business capabilities, it implements the principle of "payment according to work, more pay for more work." With this wage system, there is no need for the time-consuming and difficult-to-master wage assessment method of the past. This wage system is in line with the principle of economic accounting and is easy to control the wage fund. As long as it is based on staffing, the total wage amount can be quickly calculated. It can also encourage the enterprising spirit of cadres, because promotion means a pay increase, and demotion means a pay cut.
    Fifth, technical standards for production workers were formulated, and a general skills test was conducted among workers based on the prescribed technical standards. This prepared the conditions for the implementation of the eight-grade wage system and piece-rate wage system for production workers, and also stimulated the enthusiasm of workers to learn technology. Before the skills test, not many workers in the Harbin Railway Factory participated in technical training classes, but after the implementation of the skills test, the number of people participating in technical training classes increased. The implementation of the skills test also prevents skilled workers from doing non-skilled work.
    Sixth, the Soviet scientific technical standardization method was implemented to find the correct time standards and production quotas.
    Workday writing is the basic method of assessing job standards and an effective method of studying time consumption on site. Within the working hours, the various consumption times of the laborer are recorded and counted separately according to the time classification method, and then analyzed to determine which consumption times are required for work and which are wasteful, so as to find countermeasures to eliminate wasteful working hours and formulate quotas for various time consumption.
    We have used this method in the Harbin Rolling Stock Section and exposed many phenomena of wasted time caused by various unreasonable systems. The Shenyang Railway Sub-bureau also conducted more than 100 times of workday writing in May and June of this year, exposing many shortcomings in labor organization and proposing more than 30 rationalization proposals for improving labor organization. The original 23 people in two groups of the Siping Locomotive Section were reduced to nine people per group after workday writing, and the production tasks were completed in the same way. Using this scientific technical standardization method, a piece-rate wage system was widely implemented throughout the railway. This year, the number of workers in the operations department who implemented the piece-rate wage system accounted for 91% of the number of people who could possibly implement it.
    Seventh, in addition to wages, different supplementary wages were also stipulated according to the different situations of various jobs. In addition to paying workers' wages, the China Changchun Railway also decided to pay supplementary wages accounting for 9.5% of the wage expenditure. When a person acts as a higher-level job, in order to strengthen their sense of responsibility, those who act for more than one month are paid a temporary duty allowance. In order to reduce the use of translators and encourage employees of the China Changchun Railway to learn Russian, we implemented a subsidy system of 10% of wages for those who understand Russian. In order to solve the difficulties of harsh climates and poor working conditions in individual areas, we stipulated a regional allowance system. For some employees who are harmful to their health, we implemented subsidies for protective clothing, health care, etc. In addition to supplementary wages, a large amount of funds was also spent to improve technical safety and labor protection work on site. In order to carry out these tasks in an organized manner, the China Changchun Railway Administration established the Labor and Wages Department. There are also labor and wages engineers in other business departments, labor and wages sections in sub-bureaus and factories, and technical standardization supervisors, technical standardizers, and work measurers in major stations and sections, etc., thus cultivating a large number of labor and wages staff and training more than 1,000 labor and wages cadres for other railway bureaus and other enterprises.
    [Note 1] Eighteen O'Clock Report: Eighteen O'Clock, or 6:00 p.m., is the last hour of a working day as stipulated by the railway. Reports on the completion of various indicators are counted up to 6:00 p.m., hence the name Eighteen O'Clock Report.
    [Note 2] Per 1,000 Locomotive Kilometers: The distance a locomotive travels per 1,000 kilometers.
    [Note 3] Annual Repair Labor: A vehicle is repaired once a year, which is called annual repair. Annual repair labor is the labor required for a vehicle to be repaired once a year.
    [Note 4] Man-hours: The number of man-hours required to repair a vehicle, i.e., the labor required.

    提高劳动生产率的一个先决条件——合理的劳动组织与劳动报酬
    ——中国长春铁路先进经验介绍之九
    中国长春铁路管理局劳动工资处副处长  王肇瑞
    合理的劳动组织和劳动报酬，是提高劳动生产率的先决条件之一。中长铁路的苏联专家们从开始工作的第一天起，就着手进行了以下几项重要工作，以实现合理的劳动组织和劳动报酬：
    第一，查定站、段、厂的等级，作为确定定员、实行合理的劳动报酬和正确地配备干部的首要依据。查定站、段、厂的等级时，根据每一种工作量的多少、设备的情况、地区的主要和次要等条件，规定出每种工作的具体分数，来决定等级。例如，车站：按标准三十五分以上的车站为特等站，二十点三五分为一等站，十四点二分为二等站，十分至十四分为三等站，五分至十分为四等站，五分以下者为五等站。在机务、车辆、工务、电务等部门的查定方法也相同。这样作的结果，既改变了过去干部能力与工作职务不相称的情况，也纠正了过去在业务量大的单位少支给了工资，而在小的单位却支给了较高工资的偏向，使得定员工作有所依据。
    第二，每年都查定管理人员的定员。从一九五零年到现在，中国长春铁路共查定了三次管理人员定员。在查定定员中，使我们深深体会到：我们过去只注意完成任务，而很少计算人力，计算成本。苏联同志在查定定员中充分地贯彻了以最少人力完成最多工作的经济核算的精神。当要增添一个人的时候，苏联同志告诉我们，首先要看看这个人的工作是否够八小时，如够了，就添上，不够就不添。在这种精神下，我们减少了许多工作不够八小时的人。中长铁路管理局的总务处，过去有一个填写服务证的人，一天填一、两个服务证，有时几天不填一个（填写一个，只须十分钟左右）。因此我们决定减少这个人，把他的工作交给负责填免费票的人代作了。沈阳铁路分局过去只有十辆汽车，却要一个电焊工、一个镟盘工；只有十几把茶壶，却要一个修茶壶的洋铁匠。苏联同志提议把这些工作交给附近的机务段代作了，而把这些人调到需要的地方去。在增添一个人时，苏联同志告诉我们：还要看这个工作应由什么人来作更合适。较简单的工作，就不应该由有技术有文化的人去做。在过去，哈尔滨机务段运转室的统计工作，是由司机和副司机做的，但是这种工作完全可以由事务员做。过去，沈阳车辆段的检车工，不做检车工作，而去做饭、打更；但做饭、打更的人，反而到列车上去做检车工作。在苏联同志指导下，我们消灭了这种不合理的现象。
    减少冗员，取消重叠的机构，也是一项重要工作。在中长铁路成立以前，我们机务部门有调度工作，工务部门有调度工作，监察室也有调度工作。经过定员，我们只在车务和机务部门有调度工作。过去，我们在行车部门有十八点报告〔注一〕，车务技术室还有十八点报告。经过定员，我们把十八点报告都放在调度室去。
    在进行定员时，应该按照季节闲忙的情况来定，这也是苏联同志很注意的一个问题。养路工区、工程队等，在春、夏、秋三季的工作较忙，而在冬季较闲，但机务段冬天的工作却较多。定员时，应充分地考虑到这种情况，适当地调配人力。例如在夏天事情少的人，如暖汽工等，可以调到养路和修建工作中去。这样就能合理地使用劳动力。
    苏联同志认为：事务不多，一个人可以作的，就不必设副职。设立副职，不但给国家增加开支，又给下边增加很多层次。苏联同志还认为管理人员是不生产东西的人员，而真正生产东西的人员是工人。管理人员越多，玩弄纸片就越多，文件旅行也会增多，结果浪费了人员与经费，又给下边增加了麻烦。因此在机关里要尽可能地减少管理人员，增多生产人员。
    由于经过这样地查定人员，因此在各业务单位的管理人员定员都比中长铁路成立以前的定员减少了。海拉尔铁路分局减少了百分之二十六点八，哈尔滨铁路分局减少百分之三十七点八，四平电务段减少百分之七十五点八，阿城工务段减少百分之四十三点九，长春工务段减少百分之六十八，哈尔滨车辆段减少百分之二十五点九，哈尔滨机务段减少百分之八十七，昂昂溪机务段减少百分之四十三点六。
    但是中长铁路员工文化、福利部门的定员不仅没有减少，反而增加了。一九五二年医务卫生处的人员，比一九五○年增加了一百多人。一九五二年生计部门的人员比一九五○年增加了三百七十人。一九五二年食堂工作的人员比一九五○年增加四十四人。管理局和分局在一九五二年，都增加了一名技术安全工程师。一九五二年文教部门的人员比一九五○年增加了一百零九名，此外，还增加了三十三个学校，二百三十九个教员，并拨给每一分局两辆文化列车和服务人员。
    第三，查定生产人员的定员。生产人员，是根据各单位劳动消耗标准、设备、每人的法定工作时间、病假、欠勤等条件而确定的。例如：机务段洗检任务月计划为一百台，每台劳动消耗标准为二百小时，病欠率为百分之二，每人每月工作时间为二百小时，根据这些条件，确定定员人数为一百零二人。
    但是由于各部门推行了先进工作方法，改善了设备，提高了劳动生产率，因此在定员时，就应该调整劳动消耗标准，确定新的定员。在一九五二年制定定员时，就把机车乘务员每千机公里〔注二〕劳力消耗标准由一九五一年的一点六九人，调整到一点三一人，把车辆部门年修劳力〔注三〕标准由一九五一年的九十六人小时〔注四〕，调整为七十七人小时。
    第四，在一九五○年十月实行了行政乘务管理人员单一工资制度。这种工资制度是非常合理的。因为它是根据单位大小、职责范围不同、责任轻重和业务能力等条件，规定等级，因而贯彻了“按劳付酬，多劳多得”的原则。有了这种工资制度，就可以不用过去那种又费时间又难掌握的评定工资的方式了。这种工资制度符合经济核算的原则，容易掌握工资基金，只要根据定员，就可以很快计算出工资总额；又能鼓励干部的进取心，因为升职就加薪，降职就减薪。
    第五，制定了生产工人的技术标准，并根据规定的技术标准，在工人中进行了普遍的考工。这就为生产工人实行八级工资制、计件工资制准备了条件，同时也刺激了工人学习技术的积极性。哈尔滨铁路工厂工友在考工前参加技术训练班的人不多，但在实行考工之后，参加技术训练班的人数增多了。实行考工，也就不会让有技术的工人做非技术的工作了。
    第六，实行了苏联科学的技术标定法，找出了正确的工时标准和生产定额。
    工作日写实是查定作业标准的基本方法，也是在现场研究工时消费的一种有效的方法。在工作时间内，将劳动者各种消费时间，按着工时分类法，分别地记录、统计，然后分析那些消费时间是工作上需要的，那些是浪费的，从而找出消灭浪费工时的对策，并制定出各种时间消费的定额。
    我们曾在哈尔滨车辆段使用这个办法，揭发了因各种制度的不合理而造成的许多浪费时间的现象。沈阳铁路分局在今年五、六月间，也进行了百多次的工作日写实，揭发了许多有关劳动组织上的缺点，并提出了三十多件有关改善劳动组织上的合理化建议。四平机务段两个小组原有二十三人，经过工作日写实，每组减为九人，同样地完成了生产任务。利用这种科学的技术标定法，在全路普遍地进行了计件工资制。今年在运营部门实行计件工资制的工人占可能实行的人数的百分之九十一。
    第七，按着各种工作不同情况，在工资以外，还规定了不同的辅加工资。中长铁路在支给工人工资以外，还决定支出占工资支出的百分之九点五的辅加工资。在某一人代理高级工作时，我们为了加强其责任心，凡代理工作超过一个月者，均支给代理职务津贴。为了少用翻译，鼓励在中长铁路的职工学习俄文，我们对于懂俄语的人，实行了占工资百分之十的津贴制度。为了解决个别地区气候恶劣和工作条件不好的困难，我们规定了地区津贴制度。对于一些有危害身体健康的职工，则实行了防护服装、保健等津贴。除了辅加工资以外，尚支出了大量的资金，去改善现场的技术安全和劳动保护工作。为了有组织地进行这些工作，中长铁路管理局设立了劳动工资处，在其他各业务处还有劳动工资工程师，在分局和工厂设立劳动工资科，各大站、段内设立技术标定监察员、技术标定员、计工员等，因而也培养了大批的劳动工资工作人员，并给其他铁路局和其他企业培养了一千多名劳动工资干部。
    〔注一〕十八点报告：十八点即下午六时，是铁路规定一个工作日的最后一小时。各项指标完成的报告都算到十八点为止，因此叫做十八点报告。
    〔注二〕每千机公里：每台机车走行一千公里。
    〔注三〕年修劳力：车辆每年修一次，叫年修。年修劳力是车辆每年修一次所需要的劳动力。
    〔注四〕人小时：修理车辆所需要的人工小时，即所需要的劳动力。
