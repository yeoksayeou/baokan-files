    Seven, Old Man Jiang and his family of three worked hard for a year, and sure enough, the harvest that year was not bad. Old Man Jiang bought a cart and an ox, and became even more convinced that working alone was better than collective labor.
    Eight, The second year, Old Man Jiang’s crops were also pretty good, but the farming was a bit chaotic. He had to feed the ox and go to the field, and when autumn came, flocks of wild ducks flew all over the place. He was anxious but couldn’t manage everything by himself.
    Nine, Collective work groups led by leaders like Jin Baishan did not differentiate between plots or sections, but uniformly planned and jointly managed, implementing a system of evaluating work and recording points to "reward labor according to work." Everyone was united and willing to work hard, always striving to be at the forefront.

    七、姜老汉全家三口卖着力气干了一年，果然这年下来收成不坏。姜老汉买了一套大车一头牛，越发相信单干比集体劳动强。
    八、第二年姜老汉的庄稼也还不错，可是在作务上有点乱套了。又要喂牛又要下地，秋天来了，成群野鸭满地飞。他一个人顾东顾不了西，眼巴巴地干着急。
    九、加头看金白山的领导的集体工作组，不分地界和地段，统一计划共同经营，实行评工记分“按劳取酬”的制度，大家都心齐肯干，什么都赶到最前边。
