An Important Creation in Branch Educational Work
Zhang Panshi, Head of the Propaganda Department of the North China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee

    When the Party organizations in North China implemented the method of branch instructors giving political lessons in rural branches, they created a branch instructor lecture card system. This system has played a significant role in ensuring the systematic implementation of branch education in rural areas and improving the effectiveness of branch education. In order to summarize and promote the experience of implementing the branch instructor lecture card system in various parts of North China, the Propaganda Department of the North China Bureau sent people to Hebei to conduct a typical investigation of the implementation of the branch instructor lecture card system, and invited comrades from the Propaganda Departments of the Hebei and former Chahar Provincial Party Committees to report on branch education work. Three materials, including "The Situation and Experience of Implementing the Branch Instructor Lecture Card System in Hebei Province," were compiled. The People's Daily has decided to publish these materials for the reference of the entire Party in carrying out branch education.

    The branch instructor lecture card system implemented in various parts of North China was established as follows: The number of Party members in rural North China is very large, and it is difficult for cadres of county and district committees engaged in Party affairs to shoulder the task of educating branch members alone. In order to solve this difficulty, North China has successively established a system of instruction for branch education, that is, dividing each district into several small districts, and establishing instruction stations (also called education stations) or education officers in the small districts. These heads of instruction stations or small district education officers are actually branch education instructors, and they are very common in North China, especially in Hebei.

    This system of instruction for branch education has played a significant role in carrying out branch education, but it still cannot fully meet the requirements of branch education. This is because: the number of heads of instruction stations or small district education officers is ultimately small, and it still cannot meet the requirements of directly educating the vast number of rural branches; and their cultural and theoretical level is low, and they cannot fully be competent for the work of educating branch members.

    In order to further solve the difficulty of the shortage of branch instructors, it is necessary to absorb a large number of Party member cadres from non-Party affairs work systems to concurrently serve as branch instructors. After the National Organizational Work Conference, Party committees in various places hired many Party member cadres from various business departments to serve as branch instructors. In Hebei, they are called part-time branch instructors. Last winter, the Propaganda Department of the Hebei Provincial Party Committee also issued a "Part-time Branch Instructor Certificate" to each person. One of the important reasons why this part-time branch instructor system can be established relatively smoothly is that after the Party rectification, the Party member standards of the eight conditions stipulate: "Every Party member with a social occupation, in addition to engaging in social occupation, must bear a kind of work under the distribution of a Party organization. Otherwise, you cannot be a Communist Party member."

    After the establishment of part-time branch instructors, how to lead and check their work has become an important issue. In order to make them work seriously and establish close ties with branch members, and report problems and Party members' reflections in the lectures to the Party committee in a timely manner, a system must be established to facilitate the Party committee to realize the organizational leadership and supervision and inspection of branch education; thus, the branch instructor lecture card system was created. This system initially appeared only in individual areas. Once the leading organs circulated the information (in July of last year, the former Chahar Province circulated the experience of Shangyi County, and the Propaganda Department of the North China Bureau circulated the experience of the former Chahar Province and Hebei Province in December of last year), it was gradually promoted in various places.

    The method of the branch instructor lecture card system is as follows: After the instructor lectures, they must jointly fill out a card with the person in charge of the branch, and submit it to the district committee after signing and sealing. The content of the card includes the content of the lecture, the problems found, the Party members' reflections, the advantages and disadvantages of the lecture, the opinions of the branch secretary (or branch committee member), and other items.

    Judging from the experience of implementing the branch instructor lecture card system in various places, the role of this card system is mainly: (1) It can urge instructors to go to the branch to lecture on time and seriously, enhance their sense of responsibility for lecturing; and it can enable them to strengthen contact with the branch through filling out the card, understand the ideological situation of Party members and the effect of each lecture, and thus improve teaching work. In order to give a good lecture, part-time instructors must carefully prepare the course, which also strengthens the instructor's own learning.

    (2) It can urge branch members to listen carefully, because the number of people attending each lecture is recorded on the card, so the card system is of great help to the branch's management of Party members' classes. (3) It is convenient for the Party committee to understand the work of the instructors, the progress of the entire branch education work, and the ideological situation of Party members, and to guide the work in a timely manner. In short, before the implementation of the card system, due to the lack of organizational leadership of branch education, branch education in many places was spontaneous, loose, and some were reduced to formalism, and the actual effect was not great; through the form of the card system, the organizational leadership and supervision and inspection work of the Party committees in various places on branch education was strengthened, thus promoting and strengthening branch education work.

    Of course, the card system itself cannot improve branch education work. When implementing this system, a lot of work must be done to improve the content and methods of branch education. However, this system is indeed a better form in rural branch education work. It actually plays the role of a "network" that connects the entire Party to do a good job in branch education: that is, it strengthens the connection between the Party's propaganda and education departments and the vast number of non-Party affairs work cadres (part-time instructors), and also strengthens the connection between the Party's propaganda and education departments and the vast number of educated Party members and the masses. Therefore, this form helps us to establish a broad "education network" work in the whole Party.

    支部教育工作的一个重要创造
    中共中央华北局宣传部长  张磐石
    华北的党组织在农村支部实行教员上政治课的办法时创立了一种支部教员授课卡片制度。这种制度在保证农村系统地进行支部教育及提高支部教育的效果上起了很大的作用。华北局宣传部为了把华北各地实行支部教员授课卡片制度的经验加以总结，并予推广，特派人到河北进行了一次关于支部教员授课卡片制度执行情况的典型考察，并请河北及前察哈尔两省省委宣传部作支部教育工作的同志来作了一次汇报，整理出“河北省实行支部教员授课卡片制度的情况和经验”等三个材料。人民日报决定将这些材料公布，供全党进行支部教育的参考。
    华北各地所实行的教员授课卡片制度，是这样建立起来的：华北农村党员数量很大，单靠县委、区委做党务工作的干部是很难担负起向支部党员进行教育的任务的。为了解决这一困难，华北各地曾先后建立了支部教育的传授制度，即在每个区里划分若干小区，小区设立传授站（也有称教育站的）或教育干事。这些传授站长或小区教育干事，实际上就是支部教育辅导员，在华北各地都很普遍，尤以河北为最多。
    这种支部教育的传授制度，在进行支部教育上是起了不小作用的，但是它还不能完全满足支部教育的要求。这是因为：传授站长或小区教育干事，在数量上终究是不多的，仍然不能满足对广大农村支部直接进行教育的要求；而且他们的文化和理论的水平较低，也不能完全胜任向支部党员进行教育的工作。
    为了进一步地解决支部教员缺少的困难，势必要吸收广大的非党务工作系统的党员干部兼任支部教员。在全国组织工作会议以后，各地党委都聘请了许多各个业务部门的党员干部担任支部教员，在河北叫做兼职支部教员。去年冬天河北省委宣传部还给每人发了一个“兼职支部教员证”。这种兼职支部教员的制度所以能够比较顺利地建立起来，其中一个重要原因，是由于党员干部经过整党，实行了党员标准的八项条件中的这样一项规定：“每一个有社会职业的党员，除从事社会职业之外，都必须在党的一个组织的分配之下担负一种工作。否则，不能作一个共产党员。”
    在兼职支部教员建立起来后，如何领导和检查他们的工作，便成为一个重要的问题。为使他们认真地进行工作，并与支部党员建立密切的联系，及时向党委汇报授课中的问题和党员的反映，必须建立一种制度，以便于党委实现对于支部教育的组织领导和督促检查；于是，就产生了支部教员授课卡片的制度。这种制度最初只在个别地区出现，一经领导机关通报（去年七月前察哈尔省通报了尚义县的经验，华北局宣传部于去年十二月又通报了前察哈尔省和河北省的经验），以后便逐渐在各地推广了。
    支部教员授课卡片制度的作法是这样的：教员讲课后，要与支部负责人共同填写一种卡片，经签名盖章，送交区委。卡片的内容包括讲课的内容、发现的问题、党员反映、讲课的优点和缺点、支部书记（或支部委员）的意见等项。
    从各地实行支部教员授课卡片制度的经验看来，这种卡片制度的作用，主要是：（一）可以督促教员按时认真地到支部讲课，增强他们讲课的责任心；并可使他们通过填写卡片，加强与支部的联系，了解党员的思想情况和每次讲课的效果，因而得以改进教学工作。为了讲的好，兼职教员必须认真地准备课程，这样也加强了教员自己的学习。
    （二）可以督促支部党员认真听课，因为每次听课的人数都记在卡片上，所以卡片制度对于支部管理党员上课的工作也有很大帮助。（三）便于党委了解教员的工作情况、整个支部教育工作的进展和党员的思想情况，及时指导工作。总之，在实行卡片制度以前，由于支部教育的组织领导不强，很多地方的支部教育是自流的、涣散的，有的流于形式主义，实际效果不大；通过卡片制度这一形式，加强了各地党委对支部教育的组织领导和督促检查工作，因而推动和加强了支部教育工作。
    当然，卡片制度本身并不能提高支部教育工作。在实行这种制度时，必须在改进支部教育的内容和方法上做很多工作。但是这种制度确是农村支部教育工作中一个较好的形式，它实际上是起了一种联结全党做好支部教育工作的“网”的作用：即既加强了党的宣教部门与广大非党务工作干部（兼职教员）的联系，又加强了党的宣教部门与广大受教育的党员群众的联系。因此，这种形式有助于我们在全党建立一个广泛的“教育网”的工作。
