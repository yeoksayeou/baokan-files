    The Soviet Art Troupe's members have been visiting and performing in Hangzhou for several days. The Soviet Army Red Flag Song and Dance Ensemble arrived in Nanjing. The Soviet Film Art Workers Delegation left Tianjin.
    During these past few days, the banks of West Lake have been adorned with colorful flags, creating a lively atmosphere. The Soviet Art Troupe, led by Chulaki, consisting of ten people, has been enjoying the scenic beauty of West Lake. They expressed great admiration for the beautiful scenery. Halima Nasyrova joyfully sang "Ode to Mao Zedong" while on a boat on West Lake. At Xiling Bridge, the Soviet friends were enthusiastically surrounded by a group of young Pioneers. One of the Pioneers presented Halima Nasyrova with a silk badge of Chairman Mao. At the West Lake Museum, the museum staff demonstrated the "spraying fish basin," an ancient Chinese artifact from the Han Dynasty, showcasing the spectacle of water spraying (the fish basin resembles an ordinary copper basin; when filled with water, a person rubs the edge of the basin with both hands, and soon, due to physical vibrations, a tall fountain-like spray of water erupts from the basin). The Soviet friends expressed great interest in the wisdom and creativity of the ancient Chinese working people. The Soviet friends also visited scenic spots and historical sites such as Fish Viewing at Flower Harbor, Yue Fei Temple, and the "Hangzhou Third Chrysanthemum and Goldfish Exhibition." The Preparatory Committee of the Zhejiang Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles held a Sino-Soviet literary and art symposium to welcome the Soviet friends. Chulaki delivered a brilliant speech on issues of literary and artistic creation. On the evenings of the 23rd and 24th, the Soviet Art Troupe performed twice for more than 3,000 representatives from all walks of life in Zhejiang Province and Hangzhou City. Each artistic program performed by Ulanova, Kondratov, Halima Nasyrova, Mikhailov, Nechayev, Kogan, Chitoshiwili, and others was warmly welcomed by the audience. After the performance on the 24th, the Soviet Art Troupe held a closing ceremony for their performances in Hangzhou. The Zhejiang Province and Hangzhou City People's Broadcasting Stations broadcast the live recordings of the two days of performances. People throughout the province listened widely; in Hangzhou and Shaoxing alone, there were 150,000 listeners in one evening.
    The Soviet Film Art Workers Delegation, after staying in Tianjin for two days, left Tianjin for Nanjing on the 25th. On the afternoon of the 24th, the delegation leader Fedorov and the delegation members met with the audience of Tianjin City at the China Grand Theater. 1,500 workers, students, soldiers, and cultural, artistic, and educational workers, all of whom are enthusiasts of Soviet films, participated in this grand event. When the delegation entered the venue, the whole audience erupted in cheers. Delegation members Chirkov, Cherkasov, and Radinina spoke at the meeting, unanimously expressing that they would definitely bring back to their country the Chinese people's boundless love for Soviet films and Soviet film workers, and further promote the friendly unity between the people of China and the Soviet Union with better work. Their speeches were warmly welcomed by the participants. On the same evening, the Tianjin Sino-Soviet Friendship Association hosted a banquet to bid farewell to the delegation.
    The entire staff of the Soviet Army Red Flag Song and Dance Ensemble arrived in Nanjing on the morning of the 24th. Among those who went to the station to welcome them were Ke Qingshi, President of the Nanjing Sino-Soviet Friendship Association and Mayor of Nanjing, Zhang Aiping, Chief of Staff of the East China Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, Tang Liang, Director of the Political Department, combat heroes, labor models, and representatives from all walks of life, numbering more than 5,000 people. Red flags fluttered throughout Nanjing, and red banners with the slogan "Long Live Sino-Soviet Friendship" were hung everywhere. When the Soviet Army Red Flag Song and Dance Ensemble entered the urban area from the station, residents cheered along the way. Many farmers from the suburbs and workers' representatives from factories more than ten miles away also wore new clothes to welcome them.

    据新华社讯：苏联艺术工作团一部分人员连日在杭州游览和表演。苏军红旗歌舞团到达南京。苏联电影艺术工作者代表团离天津。
    这几天，西湖岸上彩旗招展，十分热闹。由楚拉基领导的苏联艺术工作团一行十人连日尽情地游览了西湖名胜。他们对美丽的西湖景色赞赏不已。哈利马·纳赛罗娃在西湖游船中曾愉快地高唱“歌唱毛泽东”。在西冷桥畔，苏联友人被一群游览的少年儿童队员热情地围住。其中一个队员把随身佩带的丝织毛主席像赠给哈利马·纳赛罗娃。在西湖博物馆，该馆工作人员为苏联友人表演我国汉代古物“喷水鱼洗”的喷水奇观（鱼洗形如普通铜盆，盆中盛水，人用两手摩擦盆边，不久，因物理上的振动反应，盆中就冒起很高的喷泉样的水花）。苏联友人对我国古代劳动人民的智慧创造感到极大的兴趣。苏联友人还相继地游览了花港观鱼、岳飞庙等名胜古迹，并参观了“杭州市第三届菊花金鱼展览会”。浙江省文学艺术界联合会筹备委员会为迎接苏联友人，特举行了一个中苏文艺工作座谈会。楚拉基在会上作了关于文艺创作问题的精辟的发言。二十三日和二十四日两个晚上，苏联艺术工作团为浙江省和杭州市各界代表三千多人举行了两次演出。乌兰诺娃、康德拉托夫、哈利马·纳赛罗娃、米哈伊洛夫、聂恰耶夫、柯岗、契托希维利等所表演的每一个艺术节目，都受到观众的热烈欢迎。在二十四日表演结束后，苏联艺术工作团举行了在杭州演出的闭幕仪式。浙江省和杭州市人民广播电台都广播了这两天演出的实况录音。全省各地人民普遍收听，仅杭州、绍兴两市在一个晚上就有听众十五万人。
    苏联电影艺术工作者代表团在天津停留二天后，已在二十五日离天津前往南京。代表团团长费道罗夫和团员们二十四日下午在中国大戏院与天津市的观众们见面。参加这个盛会的有工人、学生、战士和文化艺术教育工作者一千五百人，他们都是苏联电影的爱好者。当代表团入场时，全场欢声雷动。代表团团员契尔柯夫、契尔卡索夫和拉迪尼娜在会上讲了话，他们一致表示：一定要把中国人民对苏联电影，对苏联电影工作者的无限热爱带回国去，并以更好的工作来进一步促进中苏两国人民的友好团结。他们的讲话，受到与会者的热烈欢迎。同日晚，天津市中苏友好协会设宴欢送代表团。
    苏军红旗歌舞团全体人员在二十四日上午到达南京。前往车站欢迎的有南京市中苏友好协会会长、南京市人民政府市长柯庆施，中国人民解放军华东军区参谋长张爱萍、政治部主任唐亮和战斗英雄、劳动模范以及各界人民代表等五千多人。南京全市红旗飘展，到处悬挂着“中苏友好万岁”的红布标语。当苏军红旗歌舞团由车站进入市区时，沿途居民夹道欢呼。很多郊区农民和十几里外的工厂的工人代表，也都穿着新衣服赶来欢迎。
