    When He Thinks About Product Quality
    By Our Correspondent Li Yi
    "The quality of brake shoe brackets (castings used to control brake shoes on train cars) is so important! Twenty out of every hundred are bad, with cracks, shrinkage, and pinholes. What a loss to the country that is!..."
    Forty-nine years old, with twenty years of work experience, and with most of his hair fallen out due to years of hard work, Zhan Douyin, a foundry worker at the Qingdao Sifang Railway Factory, constantly thinks about the quality of brake shoe brackets day and night, while riding his bicycle to work, and even in his dreams. Before Liberation, he often thought about it too, but at that time, it was just thinking, because product quality was not his concern.
    This summer, the factory's three-month communist education awakened the enthusiasm that had been suppressed in his youth. "I am a worker, and I believe in communism. Communism demands improved product quality. I can no longer bear to see defective products. Although I, Zhan Douyin, am getting older, my heart is not old. Even though my hair is thinning, my eyes still work." He firmly believed that he should be different from before.
    In the foundry workshop, Zhan Douyin is a worker who specializes in making sand cores. His partner in making outer molds is Sun Baoyuan, who is also very fond of research and exploration. The two of them had long begun to study specific ways to improve the quality of brake shoe brackets. They asked their workshop colleagues for opinions and held "consultations" (as they put it) in the group meetings. Time and time again, they finally found the "root cause" and quickly solved the problems of shrinkage and cracks. However, the problem of pinholes was particularly annoying.
    How many freight cars should Sifang Factory produce in a month! And every car cannot do without this small brake shoe bracket. This is more worrying than your own child getting sick.
    "I can't delay the task of producing new cars," Zhan Douyin thought, going to bed at nine o'clock. Because the superiors said that all new freight cars produced in the future must meet the standards and ensure the service life.
    He lay flat in bed, his eyes unable to close. He recalled the different opinions put forward by the workshop colleagues.
    "There is too much moisture in the sand, and when the molten iron is poured, the gas can't escape." This was one opinion, and it made sense, because if there is too much moisture, the sand becomes sticky and the mold becomes hard. When molten iron is poured, it is easy to get pinholes.
    "The core is baked too lightly, and the sand is too tight." This was the opinion of his partner, Sun Baoyuan. He believed this opinion made a lot of sense. Because if the core is baked hotter, the raw nature of the soil will be burned off, the core will be loose, and the air will escape more easily, reducing pinholes. Zhan Douyin had also tried baking the core heavily according to Sun Baoyuan's opinion. However, when molten iron was poured, the number of defective products was still as high as before.
    "This is really a dead end." He tossed and turned, thinking until after two o'clock. He thought, "In the past, eliminating a few defects in a casting would have been considered a victory, and the results could be reported to the superiors. But I, Zhan Douyin, am no longer a person living under the rule of German, Japanese imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries. I want to take full responsibility for the brake shoe brackets." He further thought, "Although our foundry work is done in the factory, in the workshop, on the workbench, the quality of our castings can be seen and understood by millions of people. If twenty out of every hundred castings are bad, what a loss to the country that is!" Later, he thought about what he had said at the workshop meeting where the workers discussed writing a letter to Chairman Mao to report their production achievements: "Do our best to improve product quality and ensure that every casting is a good one." From that day on, he firmly believed that the old Sifang Railway Factory during the time of German, Japanese imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionary rule was a repair factory. Since it was just a repair factory, it was difficult to talk about product quality. Now the factory is our own, and we are no longer just repairing things. We want to build new freight cars, passenger cars, and new locomotives for the people's railway. We must be stronger than them!
    Constant hard thinking freed him from the chaos in his mind. He thought that the main problem with pinholes was the sand, that too little white sand was used. If only white sand was used, there would not be enough viscosity. Finally, he thought of asphalt. He boldly thought, "If we only use white sand to make the core, it won't be viscous enough. We need to add more asphalt than usual so that it is easier to pick up when making the mold. When molten iron is poured, the asphalt will burn, and the air will escape more easily, and there will be no pinholes at all."
    "No matter what, I'll try it out tomorrow." The midnight brainstorming ended there.
    Unable to sleep because of the matter at hand, Zhan Douyin hurried to the foundry workshop before six o'clock. First, he made a core of white sand and asphalt, and after baking it, he gave it to Sun Baoyuan to make the outer mold, and briefly explained to Sun Baoyuan the results of his hard thinking last night. At the same time, he also made many cores in the old way, as usual.
    The time to pour molten iron arrived. As soon as it was poured, Sun Baoyuan happily went to tell Zhan Douyin.
    "It works!"
    Sun Baoyuan shouted loudly, obviously with a special excitement. Because, when pouring molten iron, Sun Baoyuan saw that some of the molds made in the old way were suddenly bubbling up, which was obviously a sign of pinholes. Only the mold made with the new method sank slowly when the molten iron was poured. This indicated that the molten iron was stable and the air was escaping smoothly. After the heat subsided, they opened it and looked, and it was indeed so. The workshop workers and the entire factory were excited about this victory. Because the new product represented their achievements and was also their long-held hope. At least 99 percent of the newly cast brake shoe brackets were finished products. What about the old ones? Under the old requirements (minor surface pinholes, shrinkage, and cracks), 20 percent were defective. Even if the newly cast brake shoe brackets had defects, they were stronger than the old ones.

    当他想着产品质量的时候
    本报记者  李翼
    “闸瓦托（火车车箱上用以控制闸瓦的铸件）的质量，是多么要紧的事！一百个里头，二十个是坏的，有裂有抽有砂眼。这该是国家多大的损失！……”
    四十九岁，二十年工龄，由于长年累月的艰辛工作而顶发大部脱落了的青岛四方铁路工厂翻砂工人战斗银，为着闸瓦托的好坏，常常一天一天地想，一夜一夜地想，在上工的路上骑着车子想，黑夜里做梦也在想。解放前他也常想，但那时只是想想罢了，因为产品质量好坏不是自己的事。
    今年夏天，厂里三个月的共产主义教育，唤醒了他青年时代被压抑了的热情。“我是工人，我信仰共产主义，共产主义要求提高产品质量。我不能再忍心看着出废品。我战斗银年纪虽说是大了，老了，可是心却不老。头发谢了顶，眼睛还好使唤。”他断然地认为自己该与以前有所不同。
    在翻砂车间里，战斗银是一个专做砂模芯子的工人。和他合伙做外坯的工人是孙宝元，也是一个很喜欢研究、探索的人。他俩老早就开始研究提高闸瓦托产品质量的具体办法。他们请车间工友提意见，在小组会上“会诊”（他们这样打比喻）。一次又一次，终于找出了“病根”，而且很快地解决了抽和裂纹的问题。但是，独独砂眼问题很使人烦恼。
    四方厂一个月该出多少的货车呀！车车可又短不了闸瓦托这小东西。这比自己的孩子有了病还着急。
    “我不能耽误出新车的任务”，战斗银晚九点上床睡觉，就缠上了这念头。因为，上级说了，以后出的新货车，一切要合乎标准，要保证使用年限。
    他平躺在床上，眼睛老是合不上。他回忆着车间工友们提出的不同意见。
    “砂子里水分多，一倒铁水，气出不来”。这是一种意见，这意见有道理，因为水分多，砂子发黏，模子发硬，一倒铁水，就容易出砂眼。
    “芯子烧得火轻，砂子发紧”。这是同伴孙宝元的意见。他认为这意见很有道理。因为芯子若烧得火大一些，把土的生性烧下去了，芯子就松，出气就灵通，砂眼会减少。战斗银也曾按着孙宝元的意见，把芯子烧得重重的。但是，一倒铁水，废品还是像往常一样多。
    “这可真是走头无路。”他左翻身，右翻身，一直想到下两点。他想：“在过去，一件铸品去掉了几样毛病，这可算是有了胜利，可以向上级报成绩了。可是，我战斗银已经不是德、日帝国主义和国民党反动统治时代的人了。对于闸瓦托，我要主动的负全责。”他进一步想：“我们的翻砂工作，虽说是在厂子里，在车间里，在工作案板上，可是，我们铸品的好坏，却是千万人能看得到的，能够理解的。一百个铸件里，有二十个是坏的，这是国家多大的损失！”以后，他又想到他在车间工友商量给毛主席写信报告生产成绩的会上说过的话：“尽力提高产品质量，保证铸一件好一件。”从那天以后，他坚定地认为：旧的，德、日帝国主义和国民党反动统治时期的四方铁路工厂，是一座修补厂，既是一个修补厂，就很难谈到什么产品质量好坏。如今工厂是自己的，我们已不再只是修补修补了。我们要为人民的铁路造新的货车，客车，造新的机车。我们要比他们强！
    不断的苦思，使他解脱了心上的乱麻。他想，出砂眼主要是砂子问题，是白砂用得少。若完全用白砂，黏性又不够。最后，他想到了沥青。他大胆地想：“只用白砂打芯子，没黏性，要把沥青比平常多加一些，打模时就容易拿起来。一倒铁水，沥青燃烧，出气就灵通了，砂眼就可以完全没有。”
    “管它怎么样，明天先试验一下。”半夜苦思就此结束。
    事在心上睡不着觉，不到六点钟，战斗银就急忙来到了翻砂车间。先做了一个白砂加沥青的芯子，焙好后就给孙宝元去打外坯，并粗略地向孙宝元说明了他昨夜苦思的结果。同时，他也与往常一样，依照旧法子做了许多芯子。
    倒铁水的时候到了。刚一倒完，孙宝元就高兴地去告诉战斗银。
    “行！”
    孙宝元大声地，显然是带着一种特别兴奋的心情喊着。因为，在倒铁水时，孙宝元看到：有些照旧法打的坯子，铁水猛的向上一冒，这明明是要出砂眼的现象。独独用新办法做的这个坯子，铁水一倒，就慢慢下沉了。这表示铁水稳当，出气灵通。热退后打开一看，果然如此。车间工友和全厂工人都为这一胜利而兴奋。因为新产品代表着他们的成就，也是他们很久以来的希望。新铸的闸瓦托，至少百分之九十九是成品。旧的呢？在旧的要求标准（微有浮皮砂眼、抽和裂纹的地方）上，有百分之二十是废品。新铸的闸瓦托，即使是有废品，也比旧的强。
