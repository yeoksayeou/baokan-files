    All Regions Should Pay Attention to Protecting Young Trees and Increasing the Survival Rate of Saplings

    Comrade Editor: Currently, various regions are carrying out autumn afforestation. I would like to offer two suggestions regarding afforestation work for everyone's reference: First, pay attention to imparting tree planting techniques to improve the survival rate of young trees. As I understand it, some cadres in Suiyuan in the past had a purely task-oriented view of tree planting and afforestation, only demanding the number of trees planted, regardless of the actual effect. In some areas, the masses buried two-foot-long saplings less than two inches deep, while others buried seven or eight-foot-high saplings more than a foot deep, making it difficult for them to survive. Some also cut down saplings several days in advance, allowing the moisture to evaporate almost completely before casually inserting them into the ground. This also affects the survival rate of saplings. Therefore, when planting trees, all regions should pay attention to imparting tree planting techniques to improve the survival rate of saplings.

    Second, pay attention to protecting and nurturing young trees. As the saying goes, "Three parts planting, seven parts protection," fully indicating the importance of protecting young trees. However, many places neglect this work. For example, nearly 20,000 young trees were damaged in Linhe County, Suiyuan Province, due to the construction of flood control dikes. This autumn, when mobilizing the masses to plant trees, all regions should simultaneously publicize the importance of protecting young trees to the masses and introduce some methods for protecting and nurturing young trees. In areas with grazing habits, people who graze cattle and sheep should also be educated and organized to reduce livestock damage to young trees.

### 各地应注意保护幼树提高树苗的成活率

    各地应注意保护幼树提高树苗的成活率
    编辑同志：目前各地正在进行秋季造林，我特提出两项有关造林工作的建议，供大家参考：第一、注意传授栽树技术，提高幼树的成活率。据我了解，绥远过去有一些干部对植树造林工作存在单纯任务观点，只要求栽种的数字，不管实际效果。有些地区群众把二尺长的树秧，埋到土里不到二寸，有的把七、八尺高的树秧，埋在土地里一尺多，这都不易成活。还有的把树秧砍下好几天，水分都快蒸发完了，才潦潦草草地插到地里。这样也影响了树苗成活率。因此，各地植树时，应注意传授栽树技术，提高树苗的成活率。
    第二、要注意保护和抚育幼树。俗语说“三分栽，七分护”，充分指出了保护幼树的重要性。但是许多地方却忽视这项工作。如绥远省临河县因修防洪堤，曾损坏幼树近两万株。今秋各地在发动群众植树时，应该同时向群众宣传保护幼树的重要意义，并介绍一些保护、抚育幼树的方法。有放牧牲畜习惯的地区，还应该教育和组织放牧牛羊的人，减少牲畜对幼树的损害。    董春发
