    Yichun Forest Industry Bureau
    Should Pay Attention to Forest Fire Prevention Work

    To the Editor: The Northeast Yichun Forest Industry Bureau has not sufficiently valued forest fire prevention work, but forest fire prevention is one of the important tasks in forest areas today. The Songjiang Provincial People's Government has repeatedly instructed to strengthen this work. The Tangyuan County People's Government, where the Yichun Forest Industry Bureau is located, has also sent personnel to Yichun for special inspections. The Songjiang Provincial Work Inspection Team also helped with some protection work. However, the leading cadres of the Yichun Forest Industry Bureau did not value this work. The Yichun Forest Industry Bureau was responsible for opening firebreaks this autumn, but it has not yet been completed. From October 12th to 16th, four fires occurred continuously in the Yichun area. One of the fires that occurred on the 16th actually started in the staff dormitory of the Bureau's capital construction section warehouse. We hope that the leading cadres of the Yichun Forest Industry Bureau will quickly check and correct this.

### 伊春森林工业管理局  应该重视护林防火工作

    伊春森林工业管理局
    应该重视护林防火工作
    编辑同志：东北伊春森林工业管理局还没有足够地重视护林防火工作，而护林防火是林区当前的重要工作之一。松江省人民政府曾经屡次指示加强这一工作，伊春森林工业管理局所在地的汤原县人民政府也曾派员到伊春做过专门的检查，松江省工作检查组也帮助进行了若干防护工作，但伊春森林工业管理局的领导干部却没有重视这件工作。伊春森林工业管理局今年秋季负责开辟打火道的任务，一直到现在还没有完成。从十月十二日到十六日，伊春地区曾连续发生了四次火灾。十六日发生的一次火灾，竟是从该局基本建设科仓库的职工宿舍中开始的。我们希望伊春森林工业管理局的领导干部迅速加以检查纠正。
