    Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 19th: Our captured personnel in US prisoner-of-war camps have once again, through their heroic struggle, exposed to the world the bloody crimes of the American aggressors in abusing and slaughtering prisoners of war.
    According to an Associated Press report, on November 5th, one of our captured personnel, in order to report the truth about the US prisoner-of-war camps to the world, escaped from the hell of the Koje Island prisoner-of-war camp, but was unfortunately captured by the US side. This prisoner was carrying two letters accusing the US side of atrocities, one to General Kim Il-sung and the other to Chairman Mao Zedong. After this incident was made public, the US prisoner-of-war camp authorities could not conceal it and were forced to reveal part of the contents of these two letters. Even from this portion that the US side permitted to be revealed, it can be seen how the US side was abusing and killing prisoners of war, and how our captured personnel were conducting heroic struggles to resolutely demand repatriation.
    Our captured personnel said in the indictment: "Because we are treated like cattle and horses, more than 300 of us die every day from starvation, cold, disease, and gunshot wounds." The indictment rebuked the US military command for using the claim of free repatriation of prisoners of war to deceive them, attempting to enslave them. However, the death threats of the American aggressors cannot change their loyalty to their motherland. In the indictment, they assured the motherland that they "live for the motherland and the people, and are willing to die gloriously to achieve the final goal." Our captured personnel reported in the indictment their heroic struggle against forced "screening" and demanding humane treatment. The indictment revealed the event of March 18, which no one has known until now. The indictment said: "In political and spiritual struggles, the enemy has been constantly defeated by us. On March 18, we finally legalized our political struggle." The indictment continued: "Because this patriotic spirit has been continuously strengthened and developed due to the struggle of March 18, we finally risked negotiating with the enemy General Dodd on May 7, so that the enemy's atrocities were exposed to the world."
    In order to deny his crimes of abusing and killing prisoners of war, the US prisoner-of-war camp commander, Cardwell, stated that not many prisoners of war had died, and specially fabricated a bill of the number of our captured personnel who "died of illness," "committed suicide," and were beaten to death. Cardwell said that from August 1 to November 12, a total of 170 prisoners of war "died of illness," 64 were beaten to death, and 10 "committed suicide." Cardwell deliberately did not mention the number of wounded prisoners of war. Although Cardwell routinely referred to the accusations of our captured personnel as "Communist propaganda," he did not dare to say what "disease" these prisoners of war died of, why they were beaten to death, or why they "committed suicide." Moreover, the figures provided by Cardwell are different from the figures previously announced by the US side itself. According to the materials announced by the US side itself, the US side killed 70 prisoners of war and wounded 726 others from August 1 to November 12, and another nine prisoners of war "committed suicide." This contradictory situation shows that the US side is trying its best to reduce the number of prisoners of war who were beaten to death and wounded, but because there are so many massacres and persecutions, they themselves cannot figure out how many prisoners of war have been killed.

### 我被俘人员控诉美方虐杀战俘的血腥罪行

    我被俘人员控诉美方虐杀战俘的血腥罪行
    【新华社开城十九日电】在美方战俘营中的我方被俘人员再次以自己的英勇斗争，向全世界揭露了美国侵略者虐待屠杀战俘的血腥罪行。
    据美联社报道，十一月五日，有一名我方被俘人员为了向全世界报告美方战俘营中的真相，逃出巨济岛战俘营地狱，不幸被美方捕获。在这个战俘身上带有两封控诉美方暴行的信，一封是给金日成将军的，另一封是给毛泽东主席的。这件事情公开后，美方战俘营当局无法隐瞒，被迫透露了这两封信的一部分内容。即使从这一部分美方容许透露的内容中，也可以看出美方是在如何虐待和杀害战俘，而我方被俘人员为了坚决要求遣返，是在作着如何英勇的斗争。
    我方被俘人员在控诉书中说：“由于被当作牛马一样地对待，我们每天有三百多人因挨饿、受冻、生病和受枪击而致死。”控诉书斥责美军司令部利用自由遣返战俘的说法进行欺骗，企图奴役他们。但是，美国侵略者的死的威胁并不能改变他们对祖国的忠诚，他们在控诉书里向祖国保证“为祖国和人民而生，并愿为达到最后目标而光荣地死”。我方被俘人员在控诉书中报告了他们为反对强迫“甄别”，要求人道待遇而进行的英勇斗争。控诉书透露了迄今还没有人知道的三月十八日的事件。控诉书说：“在政治斗争和精神斗争中，敌人不断被我们击败。三月十八日，我们终于使我们的政治斗争合法化了。”控诉书继续说：“由于这种爱国精神因三月十八日的斗争而不断得到加强和发扬，我们在五月七日终于冒险争取与敌方杜德将军进行谈判，从而使敌人的暴行大白于全世界。”
    美方战俘营长官卡德威为了抵赖自己虐杀战俘的罪行，表示战俘死得还不算多，特地捏造了一篇我方被俘人员“病死”、“自杀”和被打死的人数的账单。卡德威说，从八月一日到十一月十二日，战俘共“病死”一百七十人，被打死六十四人，“自杀”十人。卡德威故意不提被打伤的战俘的数字。虽然卡德威把我方被俘人员的控诉照例称之为“共产党宣传”，但是他却不敢说出这些战俘是生什么“病”死的，为什么被打死的，因什么原故而“自杀”的。不但如此，卡德威所提供的数字，和美方过去自己宣布的数字是不同的。根据美方自己宣布的材料，美方从八月一日到十一月十二日，共打死战俘七十人，打伤七百二十六人，另有战俘九人“自杀”。这种前后矛盾的情形，说明美方极力企图缩小被打死打伤的战俘的数字，但是由于屠杀迫害事件如此之多，以致他们自己也弄不清究竟已经杀害了多少战俘了。
