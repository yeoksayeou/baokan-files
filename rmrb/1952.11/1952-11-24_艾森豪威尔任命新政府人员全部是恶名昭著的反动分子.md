Xinhua News Agency, November 22nd: U.S. President-elect Dwight D. Eisenhower has released the list of the first batch of Republican appointees to the new government. The list indicates that the Eisenhower administration, which will officially take office on January 20th next year, will pursue a policy of intensifying preparations for aggressive war, further exploiting the working people, and accelerating the arms race.

The announced appointments include:

Secretary of State John Foster Dulles. He is a notorious reactionary war-monger in the United States, and the culprit who directly participated in planning and launching the aggressive war in Korea. Another important contribution he made to the American monopoly capitalists was the unilateral "peace treaty" with Japan and the so-called "U.S.-Japan Administrative Agreement." This political representative of the Rockefeller and Morgan financial groups has close ties with the monopoly capital and militarist forces in West Germany. He is the planner of the Republican Party's foreign policy, and he single-handedly formulated the foreign policy section of the Republican Party's campaign platform this year.

Secretary of Defense Charles Erwin Wilson. He is the General Manager of General Motors Corporation, the largest manufacturing company in the United States. General Motors belongs to the DuPont and Morgan groups and is the company that receives the most military orders and profits the most from war in the United States. Last year alone, this company profited more than $700 million from manufacturing tanks, artillery, jet aircraft, military trucks, and other large quantities of military equipment.

Secretary of the Treasury George Humphrey. He is a banker and industrialist of the Cleveland financial group in the United States, and a shareholder or host of many large industrial companies and banks. He is a fellow townsman of Senator Taft and is obviously the choice of this Senator, who is known for his anti-labor stance.

Other appointees include: Attorney General Herbert Brownell, a New York lawyer and confidant of New York Governor Dewey; Secretary of the Interior Lucius D. Clay; and Director of the Mutual Security Agency, Harold Stassen.

    艾森豪威尔任命新政府人员全部是恶名昭著的反动分子
    【新华社二十二日讯】美国新当选为下届总统的艾森豪威尔已发表第一批共和党新政府人员的名单。名单表明，将在明年一月二十日正式上台的艾森豪威尔政府将推行加紧侵略战争准备、进一步压榨劳动人民和加速军备竞赛的政策。
    已宣布的任命包括：
    国务卿杜勒斯。他是美国著名反动的战争贩子，是直接参与策划和发动侵略朝鲜战争的凶手。他对美国垄断资本家的另一重要贡献是片面的对日“和约”和所谓“美日行政协定”。这位洛克菲勒财团和摩根财团的政治代表跟西德的垄断资本和军国主义势力有密切关系。他是共和党外交政策的策划者，今年共和党竞选纲领中的外交部分就是他一手制定的。
    国防部长查利·欧文·韦尔生。他是美国最大的制造公司通用汽车公司的总经理。通用汽车公司属于杜邦和摩根集团，是美国接受军事订货最多、从战争中获利最大的公司。去年一年，这个公司因承造坦克、大炮、喷气飞机、军用卡车等大量军事装备获利在七亿美元以上。
    财政部长乔治·汉弗莱。他是美国克里夫兰财团的银行家和工业家，是许多大的工业公司和银行的股东或主持人。他是参议员塔夫脱的同乡，显然是这位以反劳工著名的参议员的人选。
