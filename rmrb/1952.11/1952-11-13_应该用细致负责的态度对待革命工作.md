    Should Use a Meticulous and Responsible Attitude to Treat Revolutionary Work
    To the Editor: Our revolutionary workers should have a meticulous and responsible attitude to do their work well, but in reality, some people work with a rough and careless style. For example, our Finance Department of the Songjiang Provincial People's Government often receives tables and reports from relevant units that often have discrepancies between detailed numbers and subtotals, subtotals and totals, inconsistencies between horizontal and vertical totals, missing place values on amounts, missing signatures of heads of departments and stamps of the table makers, etc., making it difficult for those reading the tables to understand clearly. When we summarize and report upwards, we have to ask the reporting units again. However, some units are far away from us, and we have to ask by phone or letter; in urgent cases, we have to send telegrams or dispatch people on special trips to ask. In this way, the task that was originally expected to be completed on schedule cannot be completed on time. This will affect the progress of other work, or even cause losses in work. I hope that our revolutionary workers will all establish a meticulous and responsible work attitude.

    应该用细致负责的态度对待革命工作
    编辑同志：我们革命工作人员，本应该用细致负责的态度把工作做好，但实际上却有一些人员是用粗枝大叶的作风工作的。如我们松江省人民政府财政厅接到有关单位送来的一些表报，便常常有细数和小计对不起来，小计和总计对不起来，横的和直的总计不符，金额上没标位数，表上没机关首长签署及制表人不盖印等等情况，使看表的人很难看清楚。当我们汇总上报时，只好又向发表单位问。可是有的单位离我们很远，须用电话或信件问；紧急的，就得用电报或由专人出差去问。这样，原预期完成的任务便不能按期完成。这就要影响到其他工作的进行，甚或造成工作上的损失。我希望我们革命工作人员，都树立细致负责的工作态度。
