    Watching "Dawn Over Moscow"
    Lin Danqiu

    Playwright: An. Surov Translator: Lan Fuxin Director: Yan Zheng Assistant Director: Lan Fuxin

    The performance of the Soviet script "Dawn Over Moscow," which won the Stalin Prize, will forever remain in our memory because it provides us with extraordinary education. It leads us into a new real world, exposes us to the glorious reality of socialist society, and allows us to see the dawn of communism. Here are new characters, new events, and the activities of new types of workers, farmers, and artists; here is a new material life, a new spiritual outlook, new social contradictions, and new ideological struggles. All of this provides us with inspiration and education that is not only of profound significance for our tomorrow but also of great value for our today. The performance of this play has greatly improved our ideological level, enriched our ideological content, and made us understand more deeply what is meant by "progress," what is meant by "backwardness," what is meant by "mass viewpoint," and what is meant by "serving the people"!

    The story is set in the Moskovichka Textile Factory, centered on the three generations of textile female workers of the Shangqieva family, with the great struggle for production innovation as the theme, reflecting the essential contradictions of Soviet society at this stage and the powerful driving force for resolving these contradictions. The result of the contradiction resolution is the emergence of a new atmosphere in the factory, the strengthening of the great unity of employees, the establishment of new friendships, and the improvement and beautification of product quality. Here, we see the leap of socialist society towards communist society, the transformation of rainbow-like ideals into glorious reality, and how the Soviet people create their happy lives according to the principles of beauty. This is precisely a vivid portrayal of the Soviet reality, which serves as a beacon for all mankind.

    The dawn of communism shines on Moscow, echoing the dazzling red star on the spire of the Kremlin. The Soviet people use the flowers of new thoughts and feelings, the flames of burning joy, and the whirlwind of new creative labor to welcome the dawn of the new communist era. Young men and women who have just graduated from middle school, with their lofty ideals and fiery enthusiasm, look out over their motherland and admire the Kremlin towering in the dawn. Their surging songs resound through the dawn sky:

    "Let our lives surge like waves,
    We know that happiness awaits us ahead,
    In this youthful age, filled with joyful labor,
    A sincere heart beats in the chest."

    This is the chorus of socialist youth, and also the cheers welcoming the dawn of communism. However, Kapitolina Shangqieva, the female director of the Moskovichka Textile Factory, cannot understand it.

    This is a shrewd and capable female factory director, a descendant of the Shangqieva family who have been working for generations, and a loyal daughter of the working class and the Soviet state. She works day and night, busying herself, and spends all her time and energy in the factory. However, her rich professional knowledge and the constantly improving production records of the textile factory have burdened her with a heavy "complacency" package, and her conservative ideas have made her lose her sensitivity. She is satisfied with today's brilliance but cannot see the more brilliant tomorrow, and does not know that this "tomorrow" has already begun. She looks at life from the window of her office, cannot breathe the fresh air around her, and cannot see what changes have taken place in life, or what changes have taken place in the thoughts, feelings, requirements, and wishes of the Soviet people. She continues to live and work as before. The tide of new life is impacting her, and she is retreating; happiness is by her side, and she pushes it to tomorrow. In front of her lover, she tries her best to restrain her enthusiasm and can only hide by the window and door, secretly watching the back of her lover being sent away. She writes many love letters late at night, but dares not send any of them. As her daughter said, for advanced people who love life, work is joy, "but for mother, work is sleepless nights"! She does not know that the dawn of communism has already shone on Moscow.

    The dawn of communism shines on Moscow, and the Soviet people have raised their demands for the beautification of life. They are not satisfied with the products of the Moskovichka Textile Factory, nor are they satisfied with the monotonous triangular and quadrangular patterns designed by the painters, but they need the elaborate creations of artists, and need "colorful fabrics as beautiful as the dawn." Kurepin, the secretary of the factory's Party committee, the working masses, the female factory director's old mother with more than fifty years of working experience, and her daughter who has just graduated from middle school all understand this, and all enthusiastically demand to improve the quality of the products and make them more beautiful. Annyuda, a female worker in the printing and dyeing department, said: "...I remember on the day of victory, as soon as I heard the news that the days of peace had arrived, I immediately took out a piece of the most beautiful fabric I had printed before the war from the cabinet, and I cried. I was so confused, I was crying with joy. I thought: what kind of fabrics should we print for our women now? Our women have contributed to the war. Now, we should let them have a festival and let them all dress up like fairies! This is their right! For this reason, what kind of equipment has our country given us! However, our factory director only lets us make materials for shirts and trousers, and nothing else!" This is the heartfelt voice of Soviet women under the dawn of communism, but the female factory director cannot understand it.

    What she can understand is only the significance of the constantly increasing output of "popular" plain fabrics. This factory has completed 120%, 130%, 140% of the production figures... why are they still not satisfied? The female factory director does not understand why "now the farmers in the countryside all want to dress like city people"; she says that those who advocate producing beautiful fabrics are all talking in the clouds. She said to her lover Anton: "Recently, men don't know what they have encountered! They are all going crazy. You are going to Siberia to raise silver foxes, and my Party committee secretary is thinking about beautiful fabrics all day long. All this is for our Soviet women. Why don't you ask us if we have time to think about fox scarves and floral dresses?" She does not know that the dawn of communism has already shone on Moscow.

    The dawn of communism shines on Moscow, and the Soviet working people not only have the demand to beautify life, but also understand the methods to beautify life, and understand the meaning and role of the "connection system." Lizhuofu, a member of the collective farm, said to Sanya Shangqieva, the daughter of the female factory director: "...For example, our tractor drivers need good clothing materials, and the factory supplies them. But the factory needs good wool, where can they get it? From the collective farm, from the state farm. This is what I call connection. If the wool is not good, it means that the sheep are not raised well. Then, who will teach the farmers to raise sheep scientifically? Scientists. ...You simply can't tell where this connection starts and where it ends. Do you understand what I mean, friend?" Friends understand: if everyone working in this connection system recognizes the importance of their work, and knows how to produce the best and most beautiful items, then what can we get? We can get communism!

    However, the female director of the Moskovichka Textile Factory does not understand.

    She opposes the connection system, despises the enthusiastic help of artists, and does not understand the role of their professional knowledge and artistic talent in the textile factory because she does not know that the dawn of communism has already shone on Moscow.

    In this way, just because she cannot appreciate the Soviet working people's eagerness to beautify their lives with ever-changing labor creation, and still looks at new things with old eyes, she has become detached from the masses. Although, as she herself said, she grew up with the workers in this factory, can call out each of their nicknames, and has attended the wedding ceremonies of many of them, she does not understand them. She has built a high wall between herself and the masses, and is fighting a fierce ideological battle with the other side alone and exhaustedly, and her most striking "enemies" are the factory Party committee secretary Kurepin and her own daughter Sanya.

    Kurepin is an outstanding image of an excellent Party worker, "every movement of his body and every expression on his face shows that he is a healthy person in body and mind." He went from university to the army, and then from the army to the factory. His professional level is not high, and he is willing to learn humbly, but he loves life, understands the requirements and wishes of the Soviet working people, trusts the unlimited power of mass labor creation, and advocates catching up with the future, grasping its essence, and transforming the future into the present. Therefore, he is very fond of reciting Chernyshevsky's verses:

    "Tomorrow we will drink painfully,
    The nectar of the world..."

    "Pour the world over,
    Like pouring a wine glass..."

    It was under the leadership, education, and training of such a Party committee secretary, and with the encouragement and help of workmates represented by Annyuda, that the female factory director's daughter Sanya quickly grew up and became an advanced production innovator. This girl with artistic talent poured all her energy into the creation of beautiful fabrics from the very beginning. The color of the setting sun in the sky attracts her, and the ancient and beautiful patterns on the shawl of the old woman also attract her. She wants to turn her ideals into reality all the time. She searches for beautiful patterns everywhere, collects embroidery and hand-woven products from folk artists, asks old professors from the Academy of Fine Arts for advice, and attracts artists to participate in the work of beautifying products. She participates in the youth "standard group" and organizes workshop liaison groups. Her mother's constant obstruction and the failure of the first trial printing cause her pain, but do not discourage her. Her ideal is finally realized: ordinary white cloth becomes a dazzling fabric like clouds.

    This is the new generation of the Soviet state, the embodiment of beauty and strength, the passionate singer welcoming the dawn of communism, and the invincible peace guard under Stalin!

    "Dawn Over Moscow" uses its rich ideological content and powerful artistic power to attract the audience of New China like a magnet attracting iron, and you can't help but be excited, rejoice, and sing. The playwright Surov, with his sharp pen, penetrates into the depths of the thoughts and feelings of the Soviet working people, and convincingly expresses the surging innovative power that solves the essential contradictions in Soviet society. This driving force is not only manifested in Kurepin, Sanya, and Annyuda, but also in the female factory director's deep inner contradictions. Under the heavy pressure of her conservative ideas, we see her true soul resisting strongly everywhere. Although this resistance is only like a flash of lightning, it is enough to illuminate her unstoppable desire for a new life. On the banks of the Moscow River, in front of the picnicking workers' team, she unexpectedly danced wildly against her usual habits, which was precisely the eruption of the sparks of that "desire." When she lifted the heavy pressure of conservative ideas and unloaded the burden of "complacency" under the education and influence of all parties, her desire for a new life was fully expressed. She publicly reviewed her mistakes at the factory Party committee meeting, personally printed the first yard of new-style beautiful fabric, accepted the congratulations of Party committee secretary Kurepin on their three generations with a radiant face, and went outside with her lover to appreciate the beauty of the dawn.

    "Dawn Over Moscow" gives the audience of New China great encouragement. Looking back at the bloody history of mankind and looking up at the dawn of Moscow, we should understand the meaning and value of every drop of blood, every drop of sweat, and every small revolution and construction work.

    "Dawn Over Moscow" has set a brilliant example for us in artistic creation. It inspires us how to delve into reality to discover social contradictions, how to shape artistic images with flesh and blood and distinct personalities, and how to achieve a high degree of unity of ideology and artistry. Under the brilliant light of this work of art, how dry and pale are the conceptualized and formulized works of varying degrees!

    The long-term performance of this play in Northeast China has achieved great results, and it will undoubtedly win the cheers of Beijing audiences. We can only thank the comrades of the Northeast Art Theater for their hard work and outstanding contributions to this play. As for specific opinions on the performance, we can only look forward to the experts in the theater industry. (Attached pictures)

    At the gate of the "Moskovichka Textile Factory," the masses directly put forward their opinions to the female factory director, demanding the production of beautiful printed fabrics.
    Party Committee Secretary Kurepin accepts Sanya into the Party.
    The Deputy Minister of Industry harshly criticizes the female factory director.
    The beautiful printed fabric experiment is successful.

    看“曙光照耀着莫斯科”
    林淡秋
    编剧：安·苏洛夫  翻译：蓝馥心  导演：严正助导：蓝馥心
    荣获斯大林奖金的苏联剧本“曙光照耀着莫斯科”在我国的演出，将永远留在我们的记忆中，因为它给予我们不平凡的教育。它领我们进入新的现实世界，使我们接触到社会主义社会的光辉实际，看到共产主义的黎明。这里是新的人物，新的事件，新型的工人、农民和艺术家的活动；这里是新的物质生活，新的精神面貌，新的社会矛盾，新的思想斗争。这一切给予我们的启发和教育，不但对于我们的明天有深刻的意义，对于我们的今天也有巨大的价值。这个剧的演出大大提高了我们的思想水平，丰富了我们的思想内容，使我们更深刻地懂得什么叫做“前进”，什么叫做“落后”，什么叫做“群众观点”，什么叫做“为人民服务”！
    故事以莫斯科维奇卡纺织工厂为背景，以尚且娃一家三代纺织女工为中心线索，以伟大的生产革新斗争为主题，反映了现阶段苏维埃社会的本质的矛盾和解决这一矛盾的强大动力。矛盾解决的结果是工厂新气象的出现，是职工大团结的加强和新友谊的建立，是产品的质量提高和美化。在这里，我们看到社会主义社会向共产主义社会的跃进，彩虹一样的理想向光辉现实的转化，看到苏维埃人民怎样按照美的原则创造自己的幸福生活。这正是作为全人类的灯塔的苏联现实的活生生的写照。
    共产主义的曙光照耀着莫斯科，跟克里姆林宫尖塔上的耀眼红星的光芒互相辉映。苏维埃人民用新的思想感情的花朵、用燃烧的欢乐的火焰、用新的创造性劳动的旋风，来迎接共产主义新时代的黎明。刚从中学毕业的少男少女们，带着各自的崇高理想和火一般的热情眺望着自己的祖国，瞻仰着耸立在曙光中的克里姆林宫。他们的激潮澎湃似的歌声响彻黎明的天空：
    “让我们生活的时光，像波浪一样地奔腾，
    我们知道幸福在前面等着我们，
    在这青春的年华，充满了愉快的劳动，
    一颗赤诚的心跳跃在胸膛。”
    这是社会主义的青春的合唱，也是迎接共产主义的曙光的欢呼。然而莫斯科维奇卡纺织工厂女厂长卡碧特丽娜·尚且娃却不能领会。
    这是一个精明能干的女厂长，历代做工的尚且娃家的后裔，工人阶级和苏维埃国家的忠诚的女儿。她不分日夜地工作着，忙碌着，把自己全部时间和心血都花在工厂里。然而她的丰富的业务知识和不断提高的纺织厂的生产纪录使她背上沉重的“自满”包袱，保守思想使她失去了感觉的敏锐。她满足于今天的灿烂，却看不见更灿烂的明天，不知道这个“明天”已经开始了。她从办公室的窗户看生活，呼吸不到周围的新鲜空气，看不出生活有了什么变化，苏维埃人民的思想、感情、要求和愿望有了什么变化。她照旧生活、工作。新生活的激潮冲击着她，她退缩了；幸福在她身边，她把它推给明天。她在爱人面前竭力遏止自己的热情，只能躲在窗边门角偷偷看着被送走了的爱人的背影。她在深更半夜写了许多情书，但一封也不敢寄出。正如她的女儿所说，对于热爱生活的先进者，工作就是愉快，“但对于妈妈，工作就是不眠的夜晚”！她不知道共产主义的曙光已经照耀着莫斯科了。
    共产主义的曙光照耀着莫斯科，苏维埃人民提高了对生活的美化的要求。他们不满意莫斯科维奇卡纺织工厂的出品，不满意画匠们所设计的千篇一律的三角形、四角形花纹，而需要美术家们的精心创作，需要“五彩的、像曙光一样美妙的花布”。工厂的党委书记库烈聘、工人群众、女厂长的有五十多年工龄的老母亲和刚从中学毕业的女儿都了解这一点，都热烈要求提高产品的质量，使它更美化。印染部女工安妞达说：“……我记得在胜利的那一天，我一听到和平的日子已经到来了的消息，我立刻从柜子里拿出一块我在战前印的最漂亮的花布，我就哭起来了。我真混，我是高兴得哭起来呀。我就想：我们这会儿该给我们的妇女印些什么样的花布啦。我们的妇女在战争里是出过一把力的。现在，我们可该让她们过过节，让她们都打扮得像仙女一样吧！这是她们的权利！为了这个缘故，我们的国家又给了我们什么样的装备呀！可是，我们的厂长除了做衬衣、衬裤的料子，什么都不让我们做！”这是在共产主义的曙光照耀下的苏联妇女的心声，然而女厂长不能领会。
    她能够领会的，仅仅是“大众化”的素色布产量不断提高的意义。这个工厂完成了生产数字的百分之一百二十、百分之一百三十、百分之一百四十……，为什么还不满足呢？女厂长不了解为什么“现在乡村里的农民都要求穿得像城里人一样”；她说主张生产漂亮花布的人都是站在云彩上说话的。她对她的爱人安东说：“最近这些日子，男人们不知道都碰上什么鬼啦！他们都要疯了。你是到西伯利亚去养银色的狐狸，我的党委书记一天到晚就想着漂亮的花布。这一切都是为了我们苏维埃妇女。你们怎么也不打听打听，我们有没有工夫去想什么狐狸围巾和花布衣裳呢？”她不知道共产主义的曙光已经照耀着莫斯科了。
    共产主义的曙光照耀着莫斯科，苏维埃劳动人民不但有美化生活的要求，而且懂得怎样美化生活的方法，懂得“联系制度”的意义和作用。集体农庄庄员里灼夫对女厂长的女儿桑妮亚·尚且娃说：“……比如说，我们拖拉机驾驶员需要好的衣料，工厂供应他们。可是工厂需要好的羊毛，到什么地方去拿呢？从集体农庄，从国家农场。这才是我所说的联系。假如羊毛不好，那就是说羊养得不好。那么，是谁来教导农民科学地养羊呢？是科学家。……你简直说不清楚，这联系是从哪儿开始，又是到什么地方结束的。你明白我的意思吗，朋友？”朋友们明白了：假使每个在这种联系制度中工作的人都认识自己工作的重要性，而且都知道生产最好最美丽的物品，那么我们可以得到什么呢？可以得到共产主义！
    然而莫斯科维奇卡纺织工厂女厂长不明白。
    她反对什么联系制度，轻视美术家们的热情帮助，不懂得他们的专门知识和艺术才能对纺织工厂的作用，因为她不知道共产主义的曙光已经照耀着莫斯科了。
    就这样，就因为她体会不到苏维埃劳动人民热切要求用日新月异的劳动创造来美化自己的生活，依然用老眼光看新事物，所以脱离了群众。虽然像她自己所说，她是在这个工厂里跟工人们一起长大的，能叫出她们每个人的小名，参加过她们中很多人的结婚典礼，然而她并不理解她们。她在自己和群众之间筑起了一堵高墙，孤单地、精疲力倦地跟对方进行激烈的思想战，而她的最触目的“敌人”便是工厂党委书记库烈聘和她自己的女儿桑妮亚。
    库烈聘是一个优秀党务工作人员的出色形象，“他身体的每一个动作，脸部的每一表情，都表现出他是个身心健全的人。”他从大学到部队，又从部队到工厂，业务水平不高，愿意虚心学习，但他热爱生活，理解苏维埃劳动人民的要求和愿望，信任群众劳动创造的无限力量，主张追上未来，抓住它的本质，把未来转变为现在。因此他非常喜欢朗诵车尔尼雪夫斯基的诗句：
    “明天我们将要痛饮，
    世界上的甘露……”
    “把世界倾倒过来，
    像倾倒一只酒杯……”
    就在这样党委书记的领导、教育和培养下，在以安妞达为代表的工友们的鼓励和帮助下，女厂长的女儿桑妮亚便很快地成长起来，成为先进的生产革新者。这位有美术天才的少女，一开始便把全部心血灌注在美丽花布的创作上。天边落日的颜色吸引着她，老妇人身上的披肩的古老而美妙的花纹也吸引着她，她无时无刻不想把自己的理想变为现实。她到处搜求美丽的图案，收集民间老艺术家的刺绣和手织品，请教美术学院的老教授，吸引美术家们来参加美化产品的工作。她参加青年“标准小组”，组织车间联系小组。母亲的不断阻挠，第一次试印的失败，都使她痛苦，但没有使她灰心。她的理想终于实现了：普通的白布变成了云彩一样的耀眼的花布了。
    这是苏维埃国家新的一代，美和力量的化身，欢迎共产主义曙光的热情的歌手，斯大林旗下不可战胜的和平近卫军！
    “曙光照耀着莫斯科”用它的丰富的思想内容和强大的艺术力量，磁石吸铁似地吸住了新中国的观众，不由得你不激动、欢跃、歌唱。剧作者苏洛夫用他的尖锐的笔锋，突入到苏维埃劳动人民思想感情的深处，使人信服地表现了解决苏维埃社会中本质矛盾的汹涌澎湃的革新动力。这种动力不但表现在库烈聘、桑妮亚、安妞达们的身上，而且表现在女厂长内心的深刻矛盾上。在她的保守思想的重压下，我们处处看到她的真实灵魂的强烈反抗。这种反抗虽不过像电光的一闪，但也足以照出她对新生活的不可遏止的渴望。在莫斯科的河边，在野游工人队伍的跟前，她居然违反平日的习惯，突然狂舞起来，这正是那种“渴望”的火花的喷射。当她在各方面的教育和影响下解除了保守思想的重压，卸下了“自满”的包袱的时候，她对新生活的欲求便全部表现出来了。她在工厂党委会上公开检讨了自己的错误，亲手印出第一码新式漂亮花布，容光焕发地接受了党委书记库烈聘对她们一家三代的祝贺，同着爱人到外边去欣赏曙光的美丽了。
    “曙光照耀着莫斯科”给予新中国观众绝大的鼓舞。回顾血迹斑斑的人类的历史，仰望着莫斯科的曙光，我们应该懂得每一滴血、每一滴汗、每一件细小的革命和建设工作的意义和价值了。
    “曙光照耀着莫斯科”在艺术创作上给我们树立了光辉的榜样。它启发我们怎样深入现实发掘社会的矛盾，怎样塑造血肉丰满、性格分明的艺术形象，怎样取得思想性和艺术性的高度统一。在这个艺术品的光辉的照耀下，各种程度不同的概念化、公式化作品，是显得多么干瘪和苍白！
    这个剧在我国东北的长期演出，取得了巨大的收获，它无疑地也要博得北京观众的欢呼。对于东北艺术剧院同志们在这个剧上的辛勤努力和出色的贡献，我们只有感谢。至于对演出的具体意见，只好属望于戏剧界的专家们。（附图片）
