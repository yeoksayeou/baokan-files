Xinhua News Agency, New York, 24th: The United Nations General Assembly's Special Political Committee has concluded its debate on the issue of racial conflict in the Union of South Africa.

The debate on this issue unveiled a picture of racial discrimination and national discrimination in the Union of South Africa. The Nazi doctrine of racial superiority is widely disseminated in South Africa. The legislation of the Union of South Africa includes more than sixty laws that are against the indigenous people. The electoral system prevents all people of Indian descent and all black people from participating in the government of South Africa. One law prohibits indigenous people from traveling within the country without a pass, which is an insult. Black and white people in the Union of South Africa are not allowed to ride trams and trains together; they are not allowed to use elevators, and they are not allowed to go to shops and government offices that include white people. There is no doubt that the racists of South Africa are implementing these Nazi laws in their country, following the example of the United States, where racial superiority is openly promoted and blatant discrimination is practiced against black people.

Previously, the Committee had an eighteen-nation proposal (Afghanistan, Burma, Bolivia, Haiti, Guatemala, Honduras, Egypt, India, Indonesia, Iraq, Iran, Yemen, Pakistan, Syria, and other countries) that stipulated the establishment of a committee to investigate racial relations in the Union of South Africa and submit a report to the Eighth Session of the United Nations General Assembly; the delegation of the Union of South Africa submitted another proposal claiming that the committee had no right to review this issue.

The debate on the issue of racial conflict in the Union of South Africa revealed the isolation of colonial countries, which intend to obstruct the passage of any resolutions that would help resolve such conflicts.

Representatives of the colonial countries first said that the United Nations had no right to review the issue of racial persecution in the Union of South Africa, because, in their opinion, this was a matter of the internal affairs of the Union of South Africa.

Representatives from India, Pakistan, Indonesia, Burma, and other countries attacked these claims, pointing out that the racial issue in the Union of South Africa is no longer an internal affair of the Union of South Africa, but an event of international significance. Representatives from those countries asked the Committee to pay attention to the fact that the government of the Union of South Africa violated the basic principles of the United Nations Charter, and listed many facts about the lack of rights of non-Europeans in the Union of South Africa.

As a result, representatives from the United States, Britain, France, the Netherlands, and some other countries changed their tactics, and they did not dare to openly oppose the eighteen-nation proposal. Delegations from Denmark, Norway, Sweden, and Iceland put forward a new draft, which replaced any condemnation of the policy of racial discrimination with general wording about human rights.

Soviet representative Zorin, speaking at the Committee, pointed out that the eighteen-nation proposal reasonably requires all countries to pay attention to the violation of the United Nations Charter and the resolutions of the General Assembly by the government of the Union of South Africa, resolutions that require the cessation of discrimination and racial persecution against the indigenous people of the Union of South Africa. Zorin said that the Soviet delegation believes that the General Assembly has the right and the obligation to take measures to stop such violations of the Charter, violations of the fundamental principles and purposes of the United Nations, and that the establishment of a committee to study and review the racial relations in the Union of South Africa could help achieve these tasks. Zorin continued: At the same time, the Soviet delegation believes that it must be stated that the proposal put forward by the government of the Union of South Africa, saying that the committee has no right to review this issue, is inconsistent with the United Nations Charter. The Soviet delegation firmly opposes this proposal.

Referring to the new proposal put forward by the delegations of the Scandinavian countries, Zorin pointed out that the purpose of this new proposal is to replace the eighteen-nation proposal, and can only be regarded as an attempt to use empty rhetoric about respecting human rights to conceal the actions of the Union of South Africa in violating the United Nations Charter. Therefore, the Soviet delegation opposes this proposal. Zorin said: The Soviet delegation supports the eighteen-nation proposal and opposes all attempts to deliberately weaken this proposal. The Soviet delegation believes that the committee to be established under the eighteen-nation proposal should be guided by the provisions of Article 1, Paragraph 2 of the United Nations Charter in carrying out its work, namely: it should develop friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples. This will undoubtedly promote the success of that committee's work and will be sufficient to strengthen the eighteen-nation proposal. Therefore, the Soviet delegation is submitting an amendment to the section of the eighteen-nation proposal that clarifies the tasks of that committee.

The Soviet delegation's amendment was passed by a majority vote when put to a vote.

Next, the eighteen-nation proposal, together with the Soviet delegation's amendment, which had been adopted by the Committee, was put to a vote together. Delegations from thirty-five countries voted in favor. Delegations from two countries (Union of South Africa and Peru) voted against, and delegations from twenty-two countries, including the United States, Britain, and France, abstained.

When the proposal put forward by the Union of South Africa was put to a vote, it was rejected by an overwhelming majority. Only six delegations voted in favor (Britain, Australia, Belgium, France, Luxembourg, and the Union of South Africa).

Next, the proposal of the four Scandinavian countries was voted on, and it was only adopted by twenty votes. Representatives from the United States and representatives from several other countries that follow the policies of the United States voted in favor. However, it should be noted that two-thirds of the delegations did not vote in favor of this proposal. Thirty-five delegations abstained. Delegations from the Soviet Union, Ukraine, Belarus, Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Mexico voted against.

    联大特别政委会结束关于南非联邦种族冲突问题的辩论
    十八国提案及苏联修正案以多数票通过
    【新华社二十四日讯】据塔斯社纽约讯：联合国大会特别政治委员会已结束关于南非联邦种族冲突问题的辩论。
    关于这一问题的辩论，揭开了南非联邦种族歧视和民族歧视的一幅图画。纳粹的种族优越的学说，在南非广泛地传播着。南非联邦的立法有六十多条法律都是反对土著人民的。选举制度阻止一切印度籍人和一切黑人参加南非的政府。有一条法律禁止没有通行证的土著人民在国内旅行，这是一个侮辱。不准南非联邦的黑人和白人一同乘坐电车和火车；不准他们乘坐电梯，不准他们到有白人在内的商店和政府机关去。毫无疑问，南非的种族主义者在他们国内实施这些纳粹法律，是效法美国的榜样，在美国公开宣传种族优越的学说，对黑人实行露骨的歧视。
    在这以前，委员会有过十八国（阿富汗、缅甸、玻利维亚、海地、危地马拉、洪都拉斯、埃及、印度、印度尼西亚、伊拉克、伊朗、也门、巴基斯坦、叙利亚和其他国家）的提案，规定设立一个委员会调查南非联邦的种族关系，并向联合国第八届大会提出报告；南非联邦代表团提出了另一个提案，声称委员会无权审查这个问题。
    关于南非联邦种族冲突问题的辩论，显露出殖民国家的孤立，它们打算阻挠通过有助于解决这种冲突的任何决议。
    殖民国家的代表们首先说联合国无权审查南非联邦种族迫害的问题，因为照他们的意见，这是南非联邦的内政问题。
    印度、巴基斯坦、印度尼西亚、缅甸和其他国家的代表们抨击这些说法，他们指出：南非联邦的种族问题，已经不再是南非联邦的内政问题，而是具有国际意义的事件了。那些国家的代表们要求委员会注意南非联邦政府违反联合国宪章的基本原则，并列举出关于非欧洲人在南非联邦缺乏权利的许多事实。
    于是美国、英国、法国、荷兰和其他一些国家代表们改变了他们的战术，他们不敢公开反对十八国的提案。丹麦、挪威、瑞典和冰岛代表团提出一个新的草案，这个草案用关于人权的一般措辞代替对种族歧视政策的任何谴责。
    苏联代表佐林在委员会发言时指出：十八国提案合理地要求各国注意南非联邦政府违反联合国宪章和大会的决议，决议中要求制止对南非联邦土著人民的歧视和种族迫害。佐林说：苏联代表团认为大会有权利并有义务采取措施，以制止这种违反宪章、违反联合国基本原则和宗旨的行为，而设立一个委员会来研究和审查南非联邦种族关系的问题，可以帮助达成这些任务。佐林继续说：同时，苏联代表团认为必须声明：南非联邦政府所提出的提案说委员会无权审议这个问题，这个提案是与联合国宪章不符的。苏联代表团坚决反对这个提案。
    佐林提起斯堪的纳维亚各国代表团所提出的新提案时，指出：这个新提案的目的是要代替十八国提案，只能把这个新提案评为企图用关于尊重人权的空洞辞令来掩饰南非联邦的破坏联合国宪章的行为。因此苏联代表团反对这个提案。佐林说：苏联代表团支持十八国提案，并且反对蓄意削弱这个提案的一切企图。苏联代表团认为：十八国提案中规定要成立的委员会在进行工作时，应以联合国宪章第一条第二款的条文为指导方针，即：应以尊重各族人民权利平等与自决权的原则为基础，发展各民族之间的友好关系。这一点毫无疑问地会促进那个委员会的工作成功，而且足以加强十八国提案。因此，苏联代表团对于十八国提案中阐明那个委员会的任务的一节提出一项修正案。
    苏联代表团的修正案付表决时由多数票通过了。
    接着就把十八国提案，连同已为委员会通过的苏联代表团的修正案，一并付表决。三十五个国家的代表团投了赞成票。投反对票的有两个代表团（南非联邦和秘鲁），弃权的有美、英、法等二十二个国家的代表团。
    当南非联邦所提出的提案付表决时，被绝大多数票所否决。投赞成票的仅有六个代表团（英国、澳大利亚、比利时、法国、卢森堡和南非联邦）。
    接着表决斯堪的纳维亚四个国家的提案，仅为二十票所采纳。投赞成票的有美国代表以及追随美国政策的若干其他国家的代表。然而，应当指出：三分之二的代表团不曾投票表示赞成这个提案。三十五个代表团弃权。苏联、乌克兰、白俄罗斯、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克和墨西哥的代表团投票反对。
