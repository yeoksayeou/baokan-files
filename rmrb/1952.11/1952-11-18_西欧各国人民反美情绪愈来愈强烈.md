Xinhua News Agency, 13th. An article by Ferdinand and Richardson, Paris correspondents for the American magazine "Collier's," published on October 18th, admits that American imperialism, due to its increasingly oppressive measures towards Western European countries, has stirred up increasingly strong anti-American sentiment there.

The article states: "Throughout Western Europe, the United States has become the target of fierce attacks by non-Communists, shocking, bewildering, and worrying every American who hears these attacks." The article admits that anti-Americanism in Western Europe is by no means the result of communist agitation, as American propaganda claims, but is something "involving millions of people."

The article particularly points out that "the loudest complainers" are precisely those countries "we have given the most aid to—Britain, France, and West Germany." The reason for this is that America's so-called "aid" is attached with "the highest demands," and the United States has also "dragged these countries into the debilitating wars in other parts of the world."

The article goes on to describe the increasingly strong anti-American sentiment occurring in West Germany under American occupation: "Germans who have become ruthless after losing two wars, Germans tired of being occupied, Germans angered by food shortages—in other words, Germans who have every reason to be dissatisfied—have united under the banner of hating America. In recent months, there have been so many conflicts between German people and American soldiers that the U.S. military headquarters has had to impose curfews on soldiers. ... We saw that when two American officers went to a restaurant in Munich, there were murmurs of complaint, and someone shouted, 'Go back to your own diners!' In Heidelberg, we visited an old, famous university and toured a lecture hall that had just been painted and furnished with new furniture with American aid. A group of university students silently watched us. When we approached them, one student said to us, 'You are satisfied, aren't you? You think—he gestured around—this will force us to be your slaves?'"

The article then recounts a conversation the authors had with a female worker in Lancashire, England, proving that anti-American sentiment is equally prevalent in Britain. This British female worker, who "lost her job in the textile factory due to export reductions," said "indignantly": "Russia wants to buy goods from us, but the damned Americans won't let us do business. If it weren't for your government, I would still have my old job. If I sew shirts for the Russians, isn't it all the same? They won't use these shirts to shoot at me." The article further points out that even some British industrialists are "very angry about the restriction of trade with Russia."

The article continues: "Anti-American sentiment in France is the same." A farmer living in Normandy said to the Americans: "Don't think that liberation means domination!" "Americans want to take care of everything; are you planning to make us spin in your hands!" The article also quotes a French young officer as saying: "One day... we will sweep away American influence forever."

The authors of the article write: "We hear this kind of statement everywhere in Europe. ... And those who follow American policies do so with obvious reluctance."

The article admits that American imperialism is opposed in Europe, just as in Asia and the Pacific region, because it attempts to dominate the world and is creating wars.

In conclusion, "Collier's" magazine expresses great concern about the future of anti-American sentiment in Western Europe, and says: "This may mean the bankruptcy of the defense plans we have been trying to implement in these years."

### 西欧各国人民反美情绪愈来愈强烈

    西欧各国人民反美情绪愈来愈强烈
    【新华社十三日讯】美国“柯里尔”杂志十月十八日登载了该杂志驻巴黎记者费迪南及李查逊的一篇文章，文章承认，美帝国主义由于对西欧国家得寸进尺的压迫，已在那里激起愈来愈强烈的反美情绪。
    这篇文章说：“在整个西欧，美国已成为非共产党人激烈攻击的目标，使听到这些攻击的每个美国人都要感到震撼、惶惑与焦虑。”文章承认，反美在西欧绝不是像美国宣传所说的是共产党鼓动的事情，而是“有千百万人参加”的。
    文章特别指出：“吵闹最凶的”恰恰是那些“我们给予援助最多的国家——英国、法国和西德”。其所以如此，就是因为美国的所谓“援助”是附有“最高的要求的”，而且美国还把这些国家“卷入了世界其他部分萎靡不振的战争。”
    文章接着叙述在美国占领下的西德所发生的日益强烈的反美情绪说：“经过两次战争失败而变得冷酷无情的德国人，疲于被占领的德国人，由于食粮不足而被激怒的德国人，换句话说，有各种理由感到不满的德国人，在仇恨美国的旗帜下团结了起来。最近几个月以来，德国人民与美国士兵之间的冲突是如此之多，以至美军总部不得不对士兵实行警戒时间。……我们看到，当两个美军尉官跑到慕尼黑的一家饭馆去时，便有怨声四起，并有人喊道：‘滚到你们自己的小食店里去吧！’在海得尔堡，我们访问了一个古老的、著名的大学，并参观了一个讲堂，这个讲堂在美国人的援助之下刚刚油漆过并布置了新的家具。一群大学生默默地望着我们。当我们走到他们面前去时，一个学生对我们说：‘你们很满意，是吧？你们以为——他挥手指着四周说——这会迫使我们做你们的奴隶吗？’”
    文章接着又叙述了作者在英国兰开夏所遇到的一个女工的谈话，证明反美情绪在英国也是同样普遍。这个“由于出口缩减而失去了纺织工厂中的工作”的英国女工“愤愤地”说：“俄国要向我们购买货物，而该死的美国人不允许我们做买卖。要不是你们的政府，那我现在还有着以前的工作。如果我为俄国人缝衬衫，那不是一切都一样吗？他们也不会用这些衬衫来射击我的。”文章更指出：甚至一些英国的工业家，也“对于限制与俄国的贸易一事甚感愤怒”。
    文章接着写道：“法国的反美情绪是一样的。”一个居住在诺曼第的农场主对美国人说：“你们不要以为解放就是统治！”“美国人想包办一切，你们打算叫我们在你们的手心里转！”文章并引述了一个法国青年军官的话说：“总有一天……我们要把美国的势力永远地扫除掉。”
    文章的作者写道：“我们在欧洲到处都听到这种声明。……而那些追随美国政策的人们都是带着明显的不得已。”
    这篇文章承认，美国帝国主义在欧洲受到反对，正如在亚洲和太平洋区域一样，是因为它企图统治世界并且正在制造战争。
    “柯里尔”杂志在结论中对于西欧的反美情绪的前途表示十分忧虑，并说：“这可能意味着我们在这些年来所坚持实现的防御计划的破产。”
