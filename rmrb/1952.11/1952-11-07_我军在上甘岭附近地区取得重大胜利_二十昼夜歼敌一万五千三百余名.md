Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, November 6th: Since October 14th, our army on the central front has fought valiantly for eighteen days and nights on two hills north of Kimhwa and south of Triangle Hill, eliminating over 12,000 American and Rhee Syngman puppet troops. On November 1st and 2nd, our army eliminated over 3,300 invading enemy troops on a ridge over 500 meters high to the right of Triangle Hill. As of now, our army has achieved a major victory in the vicinity of Triangle Hill, eliminating over 15,300 enemy troops.

Since our army recovered most of the positions on the ridge to the right of Triangle Hill in a counterattack on October 30th and repelled the enemy's counter-offensive, the enemy, in order to maintain its "offensive" which was about to completely fail, launched another desperate attack on November 1st and 2nd.

On November 1st, the enemy gathered six battalions of troops and, under the cover of more than ten aircraft and seventy tanks, launched a frenzied attack on the hill, launching fourteen consecutive group charges, but all were bravely repelled by our army. On this day, our army killed or wounded more than 1,500 enemy troops, and hundreds of enemy corpses were abandoned on the hillside. That night, our army took advantage of the victory to attack two small hilltops in the northeast corner of the main peak, completely annihilating two enemy companies – about 200 people. Early in the morning of the 2nd, the enemy used many aircraft and artillery to bombard the high ground fiercely for four hours, and then sent five battalions of troops to launch multi-pronged attacks on the main peak held by our army from five directions, launching more than forty consecutive charges, but each time they were driven back. In the last charge, the enemy simultaneously launched a three-sided siege, engaging in fierce hand-to-hand combat with our defending troops, but the result was still defeat. The troops defending the main peak, with the support of strong artillery fire, fought bravely all day, and by dusk had completely defeated the enemy. In this day's battle, our army killed or wounded more than 1,500 enemy troops and captured many weapons.

In the two-day battle, the enemy sent more than 200 sorties of aircraft each day to help the battle, firing 150,000 shells, but ultimately could not help their soldiers climb the main peak, while our army's positions stood like rocks, unshaken.

Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, November 5th: In the last five days of October, the Korean and Chinese People's Forces continued to bravely carry out offensive operations and achieved another victory, eliminating 5,500 enemy troops.

The battle for the two high grounds on the left and right sides of Triangle Hill, north of Kimhwa on the central front, is still going on fiercely. The battle for the high ground on the right side of Triangle Hill began at 10 p.m. on the 30th and continued fiercely until dawn on the 31st. At the end of the battle, except for one position in the northeast of the main peak that was still being contested, our counter-attacking troops had recovered the main peak and all the remaining positions. According to preliminary statistics, our army has completely annihilated six companies of enemy troops, more than 1,500 people in total, who were stubbornly resisting by relying on field fortifications. During the day on the 31st, our army repelled many enemy counter-attacks on these positions.

On the high ground on the left side of Triangle Hill, our army had launched four fierce counter-attacks since October 27th, eliminating many enemies and recovering the positions that had been lost before. The last battle for this high ground began on the afternoon of the 31st. At that time, our troops, who were holding the tunnel fortifications, launched a brave attack and drove all the enemies off the mountain. In five days, our army also eliminated nearly a thousand enemy troops on this high ground.

In the last five days of October, our army eliminated more than 2,400 enemy troops on the two high grounds mentioned above and recovered most of the positions that had been occupied by the enemy in the previous days.

In other areas of the front, our army also launched many counter-attacks against the enemy, capturing ten enemy positions, completely annihilating six platoons and three squads of enemy troops, and most of two platoons and four squads. Including the results of our army continuously repelling many enemy counter-attacks after capturing the positions, a total of more than 2,000 enemy troops were eliminated.

In the counter-attack carried out in the northeast of Tieyuan on the night of the 27th, our army captured an important enemy position in just ten minutes, completely annihilating two reinforced platoons of the invading American army, a total of more than 130 people.

From the 27th to the 31st, in the five days, our front-line artillery units killed or wounded more than 1,000 enemy troops in artillery battles; our front-line anti-aircraft artillery units shot down ten enemy aircraft and damaged seventeen enemy aircraft.

    我军在上甘岭附近地区取得重大胜利
    二十昼夜歼敌一万五千三百余名
    【新华社朝鲜前线六日电】自十月十四日开始，中线我军在金化以北上甘岭以南两个山岭上，奋战十八昼夜，歼灭美军和李承晚伪军一万二千多名。在十一月一、二两日内，我军又在上甘岭右侧五百多公尺高的一座山岭上歼灭进犯敌军三千三百多名。至此，我军在上甘岭附近地区，已经取得了歼灭敌军一万五千三百多名的重大胜利。
    自十月三十日我军在反击战中收复了上甘岭右侧山岭的大部阵地，并击退敌人的反扑以后，敌人为了维持其将要完全破产的“攻势”，于十一月一、二两日再次发动挣扎性的进攻。
    十一月一日，敌人纠集了六个营的兵力，在飞机十余架及坦克七十余辆的掩护下，又向该山头进行疯狂攻击，连续发起集团冲锋十四次，但都被我军英勇击退。这天，我军共毙伤敌军一千五百多人，敌人遗弃在山坡上的尸体即有数百具之多。是日夜间，我军乘胜向主峰东北角两个小山头出击，一举将守敌两个连——约二百多人全部歼灭。二日清晨，敌军又用许多飞机和大炮向该高地进行了四小时猛烈的轰击，然后出动五个营兵力，从五个方向向我据守的主峰进行多路进犯，连续冲锋四十多次，但每一次都被打了回去。敌军在最后一次冲锋中，同时从三面进行围攻，与我守军展开激烈的肉搏战，但结果仍然遭到失败。我守备主峰的部队，在强大炮火支援下血战竟日，至黄昏时便将敌人完全击溃，这一天作战中，我军共计毙伤敌军一千五百余人，并且缴获了很多武器。
    在两天战斗中，敌人每天派出助战的飞机二百多架次，发射炮弹十五万发，但终不能帮助其士兵攻上主峰，而我军阵地却像磐石一样，屹立未动。
    【新华社朝鲜前线五日电】十月份的最后五天中，朝中人民部队继续奋勇地进行出击战，又取得歼灭敌军五千五百名的胜利。
    中线金化以北上甘岭以南左右两侧两个高地上的争夺战，仍在激烈地进行。在上甘岭右侧高地上的争夺战，自三十日夜十时开始，一直激战到三十一日黎明。战斗结束，除主峰东北的一处阵地尚在继续争夺外，我反击部队已将主峰和其余阵地全部收复。据初步统计，我军已将凭借野战工事进行顽抗的六个连的敌军全部歼灭，共一千五百多人。三十一日白天，我军又在这些阵地上击退了敌军多次反扑。
    在上甘岭左侧的高地上，自十月二十七日以后我军曾进行了四次猛烈的反击，歼灭了许多敌人并收复了以前失去的阵地。这个高地上的最后一次争夺战，是在三十一日下午开始的。当时坚守着隧道工事的我军部队，勇猛地举行出击，将敌人全部赶下山去。在五天中，我军在这一高地上也歼灭了近千名敌军。
    在十月份的最后五天中，我军在以上这两个高地上共计歼灭了敌军二千四百多名，并且恢复了前几天被敌军占去的大部分阵地。
    在前线其他地区，我军亦先后向敌人展开多次反击，共计攻占十处敌军阵地，歼灭守敌六个排和三个班的全部及两个排和四个班的大部，加上我军在攻占阵地后连续打退敌人多次反扑的战果在内，共计歼灭敌军二千多名。
    二十七日夜在铁原东北地区进行的反击战，我军仅仅在十分钟时间内，即攻占了一个重要的敌军阵地，全歼守敌美国侵略军两个加强排，计一百三十多名。
    从二十七日至三十一日五天中，我军前线炮兵部队在炮战中打死打伤敌军一千多名；前线我军高射炮部队打落敌机十架，打伤敌机十七架。
