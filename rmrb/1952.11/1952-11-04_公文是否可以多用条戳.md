    Can Official Documents Use Strip Stamps Extensively?
    Editor: In the anti-bureaucracy exhibition held last year by the central political and legal departments, we saw the benefits of "using strip stamps more and large seals less." In our daily document work, we indeed find the procedure of affixing large seals cumbersome. If there are more deputy heads in the organization, there would be a large pile of signed name stamps. This not only wastes manpower and resources but also delays the time of dispatch due to layer-by-layer review and signing. However, many comrades feel that official documents without a large seal are "not formal" or "not grand enough." When taking documents without a large seal to other organizations to handle matters, they are not taken seriously and are even turned away. For example, once our bureau sent a comrade to a factory in Northeast China to discuss official business, and when he took a letter with a strip stamp, the factory insisted that we replace it with a letter bearing a large seal before they would handle the matter. Another time, a unit in our bureau handled a letter of introduction with a strip stamp to an upper-level organization for a common official matter, and a section chief, upon reviewing it, deemed it "not solemn enough" and wanted to change it to a formal letter with a large seal. As far as we know, this is not an isolated case, and this kind of thinking is prevalent in the minds of ordinary comrades. Therefore, we feel it is necessary to publicly criticize this view. We, who do document work, should also abandon conservative ideas, recognize the benefits of using strip stamps more, and carry out propaganda to make general office workers correct those old views.

    Editor's Note: The spirit of this suggestion is good. However, the use of strip stamps should have a certain scope. Routine official matters such as general inquiries, expediting, introductions, and simple replies can all use strip stamps; as for important reports to higher authorities, important instructions to subordinates, official replies, and other important certifications or decisions, square seals should still be used. Regarding the signing issue, since our organizations today operate under a system of head responsibility, it seems unnecessary for deputy heads to countersign documents with square seals.

### 公文是否可以多用条戳

    公文是否可以多用条戳
    编辑同志：我们在去年中央政法部门举办的反文牍主义展览会里，看到“少盖大印，多用条戳”的好处。平时，我们做文书工作的就感到盖大印的手续的确麻烦。倘使机关副首长多一些，签署名章就有一大堆。这样不但浪费人力、物力，同时因为层层核签，也延迟了封发时间。但是，许多同志却觉得公文上如不盖大印，就“不正规”、“不大方”；拿着没盖大印的公文向旁的机关接洽事情，也不被重视，甚至被碰回来。如一次我们局里派一个同志到东北某厂接洽公事，拿了一份盖条戳的公函去，该厂即硬要我们换盖大印才给办事。还有一次，我局某单位办了一份盖条戳的介绍信向上级机构接洽一件普通公事，某科长核阅时，即认为“不郑重”，要改用大印公函。据我们所知，这并不是个别情况，这种思想是普遍地存在于一般同志的脑子里的。因此，我们觉得有必要公开批判这种看法。我们做文书工作的，也应该弃除保守思想，认清多用条戳的好处，并进行宣传，使一般机关工作人员都改正那些旧的看法。

    编者按：这个建议的精神是好的。不过条戳的使用应有一定的范围。如一般的商询、催办、介绍和简单的答复等例行公事，都可以使用条戳；至于对上级的重要报告、对下级的重要指示、批复和其他重要的证明或决定之类的文件，还应该用方印。关于签署问题，由于我们今天的机关是首长负责制，用方印的文件，副职首长似可不必副署。
