    The Japanese Yoshida Reactionary Government is an Enemy of Peace
    The great achievements of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference have had a wide impact in Japan. The Japanese people, who are striving for independence, peace, and democracy, widely support the resolutions passed at this peace conference regarding the Japanese issue and other issues. With the sympathy and support of 1.6 billion people in Asia and the Pacific region, as well as peace-loving people around the world, the Japanese people's peace movement is developing with vigorous strength. These facts have caused extreme panic in the Yoshida reactionary government. In a desperate attempt to undermine the influence of the peace conference and prevent the Japanese people from hearing its voice, it issued arrest warrants for the Japanese delegation attending the conference. On the 4th of this month, the Japanese delegation issued a statement of protest regarding this matter. They bravely stated that they would absolutely not succumb to any repressive actions, but would fight to the end for the victory of peace. We, the Chinese people, firmly support this just statement by the Japanese delegation and express our serious protest against the despicable behavior of the Yoshida government.
    As everyone knows, the Japanese delegation participated in the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference bearing the wishes of the broad masses of Japanese people. They brought the voices of the Japanese people, who are in dire straits, to the peace conference. Their actions were praised by all honest people. They are Japanese patriots. But the Yoshida government has subjected these representatives to all sorts of persecution: refusing to issue passports, beatings, slander, and orders for arrest. Does this not prove that the Yoshida government is an enemy of peace? The members of the Japanese delegation are peace activists from all walks of life in Japan. Among them are workers, students, professionals, and capitalists. But the Yoshida government wants to arrest these peace envoys who represent people from all walks of life. Does this not prove that the Yoshida government is an enemy of the entire Japanese people?
    During this year's Japanese general election, Yoshida repeatedly said that he "opposed rearmament" and used beautiful words such as "peace," "democracy," and "freedom" to deceive the people. However, this liar has repeatedly torn off this mask with his own hands and continues his crimes of suppressing the peace and democracy movement. With one hand, he has been hiring militarist elements in large numbers and continuing to release war criminals; but with the other hand, he has issued orders to arrest peace representatives.
    These measures of the Yoshida government are all dictated by the United States. Recent facts have proven that the Yoshida government is accelerating the implementation of the United States' war policy. The Japanese "Police Reserve Force" has been changed to the "Security Force," and the regular army is being expanded. After providing the United States with a staggering number of military bases, the Yoshida government has recently continued to provide many more bases. The fact that the Yoshida government is persecuting peace representatives can only further expose the Yoshida government's ambition to insist on the remilitarization of Japan. The Japanese people and the people of the world cannot but be highly vigilant about this and strengthen their struggle for an independent, peaceful, and democratic Japan, and for peace in the Far East and the world.

### 日本吉田反动政府是和平的敌人

    日本吉田反动政府是和平的敌人
    亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的巨大成就，在日本产生了广泛的影响。正在争取独立、和平与民主的日本人民，广泛地拥护这次和平会议所通过的关于日本问题以及其他问题的决议。在亚洲和太平洋区域十六亿人民以及全世界爱好和平人民的同情和支持下，日本人民的和平运动正以生气勃勃的力量向前发展着。这些事实使吉田反动政府恐慌万状。它为了拚命破坏和平会议的影响，不让日本人民听到和平会议的声音，竟对出席这次和平会议的日本代表团发出了逮捕令。本月四日，日本代表团为此发表了抗议声明。他们英勇地表示：绝对不在任何镇压行动面前屈服，而将为和平的胜利奋斗到底。我们中国人民坚决支持日本代表团的这一正义的声明，并对吉田政府的卑鄙行为表示严重的抗议。
    大家都知道，日本代表团是肩负着广大日本人民的愿望而参加亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的。他们把处于水深火热中的日本人民的呼声带到和平会场上。他们的行动受到一切正直人民的赞扬。他们是日本的爱国者。但吉田政府却对这些代表施以百般迫害：不发护照，殴打，污蔑，下令逮捕。难道这不证明吉田政府是和平的敌人吗？日本代表团团员是来自日本各阶层的和平人士。他们之中有工人，也有学生，有自由职业者，也有资本家。但是吉田政府却要对这些代表着各阶层人民的和平使者实行逮捕。难道这不证明吉田政府是与日本全体人民为敌吗？
    在今年的日本大选中，吉田曾经口口声声地说他“反对重整军备”，而用“和平”、“民主”、“自由”等漂亮字眼来欺骗人民。可是，这个骗子一次又一次地用自己的手撕下了这个假面具，继续其镇压和平民主运动的罪行。他用一只手大批地起用军国主义分子，继续释放战犯；却用另一只手颁布了逮捕和平代表的命令。
    吉田政府的这些措施，都是受美国指使的。最近许多事实证明，吉田政府正在加紧执行美国的战争政策。日本“警察后备队”已改为“保安队”，正规的陆军正在扩大。吉田政府在向美国提供了骇人数目的军事基地之后，最近又继续提供了许多处基地。吉田政府迫害和平代表的事实，只能更加暴露了吉田政府坚持日本重新军国主义化的野心。日本人民和全世界人民不能不对此提高警惕，并为争取独立、和平、民主的日本，为争取远东及全世界的和平而加强斗争。
