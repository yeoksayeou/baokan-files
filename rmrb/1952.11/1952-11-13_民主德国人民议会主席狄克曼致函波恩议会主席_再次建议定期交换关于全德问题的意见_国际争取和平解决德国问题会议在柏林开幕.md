Xinhua News Agency, Berlin Dispatch from TASS: Chairman Dieckmann of the People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic, on October 31st, wrote again to Chairman Ehlers of the Bonn Federal Parliament, suggesting that delegations from the People's Chamber and the Federal Parliament exchange opinions on Pan-German issues on November 13th.

The letter first pointed out that six weeks have passed since the five-member delegation elected by the People's Chamber on September 19th delivered the People's Chamber's letter of September 5th to the Chairman and all members of the Federal Parliament. However, the People's Chamber has not yet received any statement from the Federal Parliament regarding the content of the People's Chamber's letter.

Dieckmann's letter re-suggested:

	I. The Federal Parliament and the People's Chamber jointly request the immediate holding of a Four-Power Conference, with representatives from East and West Germany participating;
	II. Representatives from the Federal Parliament and the People's Chamber hold talks to reach a consensus on how to jointly defend German interests at this Four-Power Conference;
	III. East and West Germany jointly organize a committee to investigate the conditions for holding free all-German elections, and immediately begin discussing methods for organizing this committee and setting a date for the committee to begin its activities;
	IV. Allowing the People's Chamber delegation the opportunity to freely and unhinderedly present to the Federal Parliament the People's Chamber's views on all issues to be discussed; the People's Chamber has also suggested that the Federal Parliament send a delegation to Berlin to explain the Federal Parliament's views to the People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic.

The letter concluded by suggesting that the Federal Parliament exchange views on the above issues on November 13th or an earlier date, and requested the Federal Parliament to inform it when it is prepared to state its attitude towards the People's Chamber's suggestions, so that the People's Chamber delegation can present its views when the Federal Parliament is in session.

According to West German sources: Dieckmann's letter has aroused great attention among the West German public. The Nuremberg newspapers all published news about the letter with very large headlines.

Xinhua News Agency, dated 10th: TASS, Berlin, 9th. The International Conference for Peaceful Resolution of the German Question opened in Berlin on November 8th.

Representatives from twelve European countries, including Germany, Poland, Czechoslovakia, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Britain, Italy, Austria, Switzerland, and Finland, are attending the conference. The purpose of the conference is to discuss the peaceful resolution of the German question and to guarantee the security of Germany's neighbors.

The conference is chaired by Mr. Elfes, former Mayor of Munich-Gladbach, Germany. After the chairman made a brief opening speech, Dieckmann, the representative of the German Democratic Republic, spoke. Dieckmann pointed out that people with very different political views and religious beliefs, as well as representatives from all strata of society from many countries, are gathered together at this conference. Dieckmann expressed his firm belief that the conference will successfully complete its work and make a significant contribution to the peaceful resolution of the German question and the safeguarding of peace and international security.

One of the initiators of the conference, Domenach, editor-in-chief of the French Catholic magazine "Esprit," pointed out in his speech that the so-called "European Defense Community" treaty seriously endangers peace.

Before the opening of the conference, the delegates also held a press conference in Berlin. Speakers at the press conference included Domenach, Italian parliamentarian Nitti, West German pastor Martin Niemöller, former German Imperial Chancellor Wirth, Elfes, Professor Fassbinder of Bonn University, and many other well-known social figures from West Germany and other European countries. The speakers emphasized the important significance of the conference.

    信中首先指出：自从九月十九日人民议会选出的五人代表团，把人民议会在九月五日写给联邦议会主席及全体议员的信，送交给爱勒斯本人以来，至今已有六个星期了。但是，人民议会还没有收到联邦议会关于人民议会信件内容的任何声明。
    狄克曼的信再次建议：
    一、联邦议会与人民议会联合要求立刻举行四国会议，并由东德与西德派代表参加；
    二、联邦议会与人民议会代表举行会谈，以便就如何在这次四大国会议上共同保卫德国利益的问题，取得一致的意见；
    三、东德与西德共同组织一个委员会，调查举行全德自由选举的条件，并立刻开始讨论组织这个委员会的方法，规定这个委员会开始活动的日期；
    四、让人民议会代表团有机会自由地、不受阻碍地向联邦议会提出人民议会关于要进行讨论的所有问题的见解；人民议会也已经建议联邦议会派遣一个代表团到柏林来，以便向德意志民主共和国人民议会说明联邦议会的意见。
    信中最后建议与联邦议会在十一月十三日或更早的日子，就上述问题交换意见，并要求联邦议会告知它准备在什么时候表明它对于人民议会建议的态度，以便人民议会代表团在联邦议会开会时可以提出它的意见。
    据西德消息：狄克曼的信件已引起西德公众的极大注意。纽伦堡各报均以极大的标题登载了有关这封信的消息。
    【新华社十日讯】据塔斯社柏林九日讯：国际争取和平解决德国问题会议已于十一月八日在柏林开幕。

    会议的发起人之一、法国天主教杂志“灵报”总编辑多门纳克在发言中指出：所谓“欧洲防务集团”条约严重危害和平。
