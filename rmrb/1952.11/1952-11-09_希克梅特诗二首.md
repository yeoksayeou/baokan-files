Two Poems by Hikmet

    Birth

    My wife gave birth to a child for me.
    He has golden hair, light eyebrows;
    Breathing gently—
    He lies like a shining sphere in a sky-blue little quilt—
    Weighed, three kilograms.

    When my child was born,
    Children were also born in Korea,
    All of them children like sunflowers;
    But,
    Before they could suckle their mother's milk,
    They were immediately killed by MacArthur's bloody hands.

    When my child was born,
    Children were also born in Greek prisons,
    Iron bars are
    The first thing they can see and approach for warmth in the world.

    When my child was born,
    Children were also born in Anatolia. [Note]
    They have blue eyes,
    Black eyes,
    Brown eyes.
    But lice immediately crawl all over their bodies.
    Some children even survive—
    I don't know what miracle they encountered.

    When my child was born,
    Children were also born in the greatest country,
    They are immediately bathed in happiness—
    May all the children of the world receive such happiness.

    When my child grows up,
    To my age—
    I will die.
    But then,
    The whole world will become a huge cradle,
    Covered with quilts of flowered silk,
    Will sing lullabies for all the children of the world,
    Regardless of race or color.
    [Note] Refers to Turkey. —Translator

    To Brown, an American Soldier under General Clark in Korea

    Mr. Brown,
    Undoubtedly, you already know
    —Or maybe you don't know—
    We,
    The peace defenders of Asia, the Pacific region, and the Middle East,
    Have held a five-day meeting in Beijing.

    Mr. Brown,
    I have a question for you:
    Yesterday, October 6th, Monday,
    Around 5 p.m.,
    What were you doing in Korea?

    At that time, we were cheering.
    Several people from the same country as you,
    Brought bouquets of bright flowers
    Picked from the gardens of Beijing
    And gave them to
    Several people from Korea.

    The Koreans are
    Firm,
    Polite,
    A little reserved.
    Your compatriots are full of enthusiasm,
    Very humble.
    I am a Turk,
    And I have the same feeling as them in front of the Koreans! [Note]

    They kissed,
    Their eyes were wet,
    We applauded for a long time.

    They are the same Americans as you,
    Maybe one of them is your fellow countryman,
    The one wearing glasses,
    Maybe he is your neighbor.

    You, Mr. Brown,
    My God,
    Yesterday, around 5 p.m.,
    What were you doing in Korea?

    [Note] The Turkish government has troops stationed in Korea. —Translator

    希克梅特诗二首
    诞生
    我的妻子给我生下了一个孩子。
    他有着金色的头发，淡淡的眉毛；
    在轻匀地呼吸——
    他像一个发光的圆球躺在天蓝色的小被子里——
    称了一称，三公斤重。
    当我的孩子诞生的时候，
    也有孩子诞生在朝鲜，
    都是些像向日葵一样的孩子；
    但是，
    他们还没有吸到母亲的乳汁，
    就马上被麦克阿瑟的血手杀死了。
    当我的孩子诞生的时候，
    也有孩子降生在希腊的监狱里，
    铁窗就是
    他们在世界上能够看见的能够靠近取暖的头一件东西。
    当我的孩子诞生的时候，
    也有孩子诞生在安那托里亚。〔注〕
    他们长着蓝色的眼睛，
    黑色的眼睛，
    褐色的眼睛。
    但是，虱子立刻爬满了他们的全身。
    有些孩子竟能活下来——
    我不知道他们遇见了什么奇迹。
    当我的孩子诞生的时候，
    也有孩子诞生在最伟大的国家，
    他们立即沐浴在幸福里面——
    愿全世界的孩子们都能得到这样的幸福。
    当我的孩子长大成人，
    到了我这样的年纪——
    我将死去。
    但是那时，
    全世界将会变成一个巨大的摇篮，
    铺满花绸的被子，
    将为全世界的孩子们，
    不分种族肤色，
     唱起催眠曲。
     〔注〕指土耳其。——译者

    致朝鲜克拉克将军手下的美国兵布朗
    布朗先生，
    无疑地，你已经知道
    ——或者可能你不知道——
    我们，
    亚洲的，太平洋区域的，中东的
    和平保卫者们，
    已经在北京开了五天的会。
    布朗先生，
    我有个问题要问你：
    昨天，十月六日，星期一，
    下午五点钟左右，
    你干些什么，在朝鲜？
    那时候，我们在欢呼。
    几个和你来自同一国家的人，
    把摘自北京花园里的
    光明的花束送给
    几个来自朝鲜的人。
    朝鲜人
    坚定，
    有礼，
    有一些拘谨。
    你的同胞们充满热情，
    十分谦虚。
    我是一个土耳其人，
    在朝鲜人面前，
    也和他们有同样的感觉啊！〔注〕
    他们亲吻，
    眼睛湿了，
    我们长久地鼓掌。
    他们和你是一样的美国人，
    可能其中有一个是你同乡，
    那个戴眼镜的，
    也许就是你的街坊。
    你，布朗先生，
    我的上帝啊，
    昨天，下午五点钟左右，
    你在干些什么呢，在朝鲜？
    〔注〕土耳其政府派有军队在朝鲜。——译者
