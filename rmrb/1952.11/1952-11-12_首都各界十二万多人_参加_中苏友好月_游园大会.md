Xinhua News Agency, November 11th: The Beijing Sino-Soviet Friendship Association held a grand "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month" garden party at the Working People's Cultural Palace from the 8th to the 10th. More than 120,000 people from all walks of life in the capital participated in the garden party.

During the garden party, the Central Acrobatic Troupe, the Acrobatic Troupe of the Central Academy of Chinese Opera, and other folk art groups in the capital performed more than sixty wonderful programs each day. The Central Acrobatic Troupe (formerly known as the China Acrobatic Troupe) performed in the Soviet Union in 1950 and received extremely high praise. Chen Baiyu's "Water Meteor," Yin Yuhong's "Plate Spinning," Guan Yuhe's "Hoop Diving," and Wang Kuiying's "Chinese Yo-Yo," which were warmly praised by Soviet audiences, became highlights of their performances again. Magician Yang Xiaoting also ingeniously added content about Sino-Soviet friendship to his performances. He cleverly conjured a peace dove from a red silk, and then conjured a red banner behind the dove, with the words "Long Live Sino-Soviet Friendship!" All these programs were warmly welcomed by the audience.

On the 9th and 10th, more than 15,000 workers, farmers, students, and citizens visited the Soviet Photo Exhibition. More than one hundred exquisite pictures vividly showed the great achievements of the Soviet people in carrying out communist construction projects and the happy lives of Soviet children. In the stadium, students from the All-China Sports Federation training class and staff members of the Soviet Embassy held friendly ball game matches. In the Labor Theater, Soviet films such as "Bright Summer," "Soviet Grand Circus," and "Michurin" were also screened. In the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month Reading Station" set up under the shade of trees, groups of people were attracted to read Soviet pictorials. Everywhere in the park, people were enthusiastically singing and dancing. Many people learned Soviet folk dances such as "Butterfly Polka" and "Field Dance" to celebrate "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month." The Cultural Service Section of the Working People's Cultural Palace also specially organized a "Group Dance Coaching Station" to help everyone learn Soviet dances.

At night, in the front grove, ten thousand colorful electric lights shone on more than three hundred ancient cypress trees. Under the bright mercury lights, the golden relief statues of Chairman Mao and Stalin looked even more radiant. At this time, the park looked particularly brilliant and splendid, and the dancing crowds were even more jubilant.

    首都各界十二万多人
    参加“中苏友好月”游园大会
    【新华社十一日讯】北京市中苏友好协会于八日至十日，在劳动人民文化宫举办了一个盛大的“中苏友好月”游园大会，首都各界人民参加游园的有十二万多人。
    游园大会期间，中央杂技团、中央戏曲研究院杂技团和首都其他曲艺团体，每天分别演出了六十多个精彩节目。中央杂技团（过去称中华杂技团）曾于一九五○年去苏联演出，获得了极高的评价；曾经受到苏联观众们热烈赞赏的陈白玉的“水流星”、尹钰宏的“耍盘子”、关玉和的“钻圈”和王葵英的“空竹”等，又成了他们这次演出中的精彩节目。魔术演员杨小亭还独出心裁地在演出节目中增添了中苏友好的内容。他在红绸里巧妙地变出一只和平鸽，又在鸽子的后面变出了一幅红色锦旗，上面写着：“中苏友好万岁！”所有这些节目，都受到观众们热烈的欢迎。
    九、十两天，有一万五千多工人、农民、学生和市民参观了苏联图片展览会。一百多张精美的图片，生动地表现出苏联人民进行共产主义建设工程的巨大成就和苏联儿童的幸福生活。在体育场上，中华全国体育总会体育训练班的学员和苏联大使馆工作人员举行了球类友谊比赛。在劳动剧场，还放映了“明朗的夏天”、“苏联大马戏团”和“米丘林”等苏联影片。在浓荫树林下设置的“中苏友好月阅览站”中，吸引着成群的人们在那里阅读苏联的画报。在园内每一个地方，人们都在热情地歌舞。很多人为了庆祝“中苏友好月”学会了“蝴蝶波莉卡”、“田野舞”等苏联民间舞蹈。劳动人民文化宫文化服务科还专门组织了一个“集体舞辅导站”，帮助大家学习苏联舞蹈。
    入晚，前树林里，三百多棵古老的柏树上，万盏五色电灯放光，在雪亮的水银灯光下，毛主席和斯大林的金色浮雕像更显得光彩四射。这时，园内显得分外灿烂辉煌，歌舞的人群更加欢腾。
