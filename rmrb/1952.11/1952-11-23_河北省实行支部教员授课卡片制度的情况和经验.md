The General Situation of Implementing the Card System Throughout the Province

According to our preliminary understanding of the seven district party committees in Baoding, Tongxian, Shijiazhuang, Handan, Tianjin, Dingxian, and Cangxian, all but the Cangxian district party committee have implemented the card system. The best implementation is in the Shijiazhuang and Handan district party committees, followed by the Baoding district party committee, while Tongxian, Tianjin, and Dingxian district party committees are relatively poor.

In the Shijiazhuang district party committee, except for most of Luancheng and all of Yuanshi, where implementation is poor, the vast majority of part-time branch instructors in other counties have implemented the card system. Among them, Lingshou, Jianping, Pingshan, and the fourth district of Luancheng are the best. In the Handan district party committee, 70% of the part-time branch instructors throughout the district can implement the card system. Among them, Daming and Cheng'an are good, while Wu'an, Weixian, and Linzhang are second best.

Benefits of Implementing the Card System

Based on the analysis of existing materials, we believe that the implementation of the card system has the following three main benefits:

(1) Implementing the lecture card system can urge part-time branch instructors to give lectures at the branch on time and seriously, enhance their sense of responsibility, and make them pay attention to the educational effect. Before the implementation of the card system, when assigning party member cadres to give lectures to the branch, the lecturers often had a task-oriented view, finishing the lecture and not paying attention to the educational effect. After the implementation of the card system, part-time branch instructors were prompted to gain an in-depth understanding of the situation, participate in discussions, listen to feedback, and discover problems. Therefore, they can conduct lectures in light of the ideological situation of party members and answer questions in a timely manner. This makes the instructors gradually familiar with the branch education work, grasp the ideological situation of party members, improve educational methods, and thus improve the educational effect. For example, Comrade Wang Mingzhen, a part-time branch instructor in Zhengding County, said: "In the past, when I gave lectures to the branch, I just read from the book and finished the task, only bearing half the responsibility for branch education. After implementing the card system, I must be responsible to the end, because there is a 'party member feedback' item on the card, and I cannot fill out the card without finding any feedback. For example, after I gave lectures to the Dong and Xi Sucun branches, the party members did not speak during the discussion, and later said: 'The lectures are good, clear, and comprehensive, but we can't remember them, and we don't know what to remember.' After hearing this, I realized that there was a problem with my lecture method. I just read from the book, without linking it to reality, and the key points were not clear. Later, I changed my lecture method and it was very well received." Another example is that two cadres from the Daming County Party Committee Office were assigned to teach one branch. Before the implementation of the card system, they shirked each other. After the implementation of the card system, they all competed to give lectures.

(2) It is convenient for the party committee to understand the work of part-time branch instructors and the progress of the entire branch education work in a timely manner. It is also convenient for the party committee to understand the ideological situation of party members and guide the work in a timely manner. For example, when a part-time branch instructor in the first district of Tongxian went to the branch to give lectures, he found that some party members had exploited others in the mutual aid group, using one mule to replace three people's labor, which other party members and the masses were dissatisfied with. He also found that some party members mistakenly believed that party members were not allowed to hire laborers, and therefore mistakenly believed that the masses were also not allowed to hire laborers. When these problems are filled in on the card, it can help the party committee to understand the situation in a timely manner, immediately take measures to correct deviations, and correctly implement policies. Another example is that the Jize County Party Committee found that part-time branch instructor Wang Jinyi had made a mistake in explaining the issue of party members not being allowed to be rich peasants, and the county party committee immediately instructed the district party committee to correct it.

(3) It promoted cadres' study of theory, policies, and practice. In the past, some cadres often relaxed their study due to busy work. Even when they studied, they often skimmed the surface and did not seek thorough understanding. After the implementation of the card system, the branch instructors must give serious lectures to the branch, so they must do a good job of preparing for the lectures, understand the center and key points of each lesson, and understand its spirit. This gradually cultivates the habit of cadres delving into documents and promotes cadres' study. For example, Comrade Wang Mingzhen said: "In the past, I studied casually. Now, with this card to fill out, I can't be casual anymore. I have to prepare the lesson well and carefully study the key points of the text and how to relate it to reality."

Several Issues that Must be Resolved in Leadership

The experience of various places in implementing the card system proves that in order to implement the card system and ensure the regular nature of branch education work, the propaganda department of the party committee must solve the following issues in leadership:

(1) Before promoting the card system, the qualifications of part-time branch instructors must be carefully reviewed, and sufficient ideological mobilization work must be done. Those who do not meet the requirements should not be hired, and do not engage in shoddy work. Part-time branch instructors should be made aware that "every Communist Party member, in addition to engaging in social occupations, must undertake a task assigned by a party organization" is the obligation of a Communist Party member. The role and significance of implementing the card system should be explained to branch instructors to correct the mistaken belief that being a part-time branch instructor is an "extra burden" and that filling out the card is an extra procedure. Experience has proven that wherever the ideological mobilization work is done well, and erroneous understandings are overcome, the card system can be adhered to and the results will be greater. For example, in Lingshou, Jianping, Pingshan and other counties in the Shijiazhuang District Party Committee area, the vast majority of part-time branch instructors can implement the card system. They not only do not consider it a "trouble" or an "extra burden," but also believe that the implementation of the card system has more benefits and convenience. Some responsible cadres, such as the head of the government section and the director of the bank in some counties (such as Pingshan), even if they do not attend the branch education station (or the branch) to give lectures on time, can proactively make up the lectures or explain the reasons to the competent department. Another example is that in some places in Daming and Weixian, two part-time branch instructors jointly teach one branch, and they all compete to go to the branch to give lectures. Conversely, if you do not start with ideological mobilization to solve ideological problems, so that they consciously take responsibility for education, and only use organizational orders to urge lectures, it is impossible to do a good job. For example, Comrade Song Weiqi, a staff member of the United Front Work Department of the Baoding District Party Committee, did not do a good job of ideological mobilization, and only gave one lecture under the urging of the organization. Later, when the urging became tighter, he raised that his work was busy and that serving as a branch instructor was an "extra burden," and requested to resign as a part-time branch instructor. Another example is that some part-time branch instructors in the Tongxian District Party Committee believe that the implementation of the card system is "one more step," and they find it "troublesome." Even the Minister of Propaganda of the Luancheng County Party Committee holds this view. In this way, it is impossible to adhere to the card system and do a good job in branch education.

(2) Because the political and cultural level of the current part-time branch instructors is generally low, and they are not familiar with branch education work, coupled with the fact that the content of the teaching materials is politically ideological and policy-oriented, if the part-time branch instructors do not have a deep understanding themselves, they will not be bold enough to give lectures to the branch. Therefore, the leadership must regularly and timely give preparatory lessons to the part-time branch instructors, help them study the key points of the teaching materials, so that they understand the purpose of the lectures; timely strengthen business guidance, and specifically help them study and improve teaching methods, and solve difficult problems in branch education work. After Lingshou, Pingshan, Jianping and other counties did this, the part-time branch instructors felt that they "had a way," and their enthusiasm also increased. Some counties did not do this, which made the branch education work form a self-flowing state.

(3) The propaganda department of the party committee should seriously handle the "cards" submitted by the instructors, summarize them regularly, and commend and criticize the instructors. Pingshan, Huolu and other counties did this, and many part-time branch instructors said: "The leaders know how we are doing our work." Comrade An Runshen, the secretary of the Pingshan County Supply and Marketing Cooperative, was very active when he became a part-time branch instructor, but later he became less active. After the implementation of the card system, he became active again. Meng Tongwei, the director of the Huolu County Police Station, has always been active in branch education work. The county issued a notice to commend him, and he became even more active. Now he is responsible for giving lessons to two branches alone, and has never interrupted once. The District Party Secretary of the first district (Chengguan District) of the county also contracted a branch, but he failed to attend classes on time because he did not implement the card system. When the district committee reviewed the branch education work, he made a self-criticism; now that the card system has been established, he can also give lectures on time. Conversely, some counties do not process the returned cards, and the instructors gradually stop submitting them, the lectures become less frequent, and the branch education work becomes disorganized.

(4) The items on the "card" should be correctly specified. The items on the "card" are very inconsistent among the district and county party committees. Some are too simple to reflect the problem and cannot play their due role; some are too complicated, because the part-time branch instructors have a low level of education and cannot fill them out, and filling them out wastes time. Based on our research on the "card" items in various places, we believe that in addition to the three items of time, place, and number of attendees, the following items should also be included: (1) the main points of the lecture; (2) the problems found; (3) the feedback from party members; (4) the advantages and disadvantages of the lecture; (5) the opinions of the branch secretary (or branch committee member). If these five items can be filled in well, the party committee can see the whole picture of branch education, grasp the ideological situation of party members, and facilitate guidance. The last item may seem unimportant, but if it can be implemented seriously, it will promote branch party members to supervise the work of part-time branch instructors. For example, Han Shouxian, a part-time branch instructor in the sixth district of Daming, had the ideological baggage of being a "veteran," and he was indifferent to lecturing. He did not prepare before the lecture, and just read the text when he arrived at the branch. As a result, the party members were not satisfied, and gave him opinions, saying that his lectures were "not related to reality, just copying the original text," and asked him to fill it in on the "card" and hand it over to the higher-level party committee. After the "card" was handed over to the county party committee, the county party committee pointed out his shortcomings. He recognized his mistakes, changed his erroneous thinking of being a "veteran" and indifferent, and began to study seriously.

    河北省实行支部教员授课卡片制度的情况和经验
    全省执行卡片制度的一般情况
    据我们对保定、通县、石家庄、邯郸、天津、定县、沧县等七个地委区的初步了解，除沧县地委区外，其他六个地委区都推行了卡片制度。推行最好的是石家庄和邯郸两个地委区，其次是保定地委区，通县、天津和定县地委区较差。
    石家庄地委区，除栾城大部、元氏全部执行较差外，其他县的绝大多数兼职支部教员，都执行了卡片制度。其中以灵寿、建屏、平山和栾城四区为最好。邯郸地委区全区兼职支部教员，能执行卡片制度的占百分之七十。其中以大名、成安为好，武安、魏县、临漳等县次之。
    实行卡片制度的好处
    根据现有材料的分析，我们认为实行卡片制度，主要的有以下三方面的好处：
    （一）实行授课卡片制度，可以督促兼职支部教员按时地并认真地到支部讲课，增强兼职支部教员的责任心，使他们注意教育效果。在实行卡片制度以前，分配党员干部给支部讲课，讲课人多存任务观点，讲完了事，不注意教育效果。实行卡片制度后，促使兼职支部教员深入了解情况，参加讨论，听取反映，发现问题，因此，他们就能结合党员的思想情况进行讲课和及时解答问题。这样就使得教员逐渐熟悉了支部教育工作，掌握了党员的思想情况，改进了教育方法，从而提高了教育效果。如正定县兼职支部教员王明珍同志说：“过去我给支部讲课，只是照本一念完事，对支部教育只是负到一半责任。实行了卡片制度以后，我必须负责到底，因为卡片上有党员反映一项，找不到反映就无法填卡片。比如我给东、西宿村支部讲课后，讨论时党员都不发言，后来说：‘讲的好，讲的清，讲的多，就是记不住，也不知道该记那些要紧。’我听到后，发现自己讲课方法上有毛病，只是照本念，没有联系实际，重点不明确。以后我改变了讲课的方法，很受欢迎。”又如大名县委办公室两个干部包教一个支部，未实行卡片制度以前，互相推诿，实行卡片制度之后，都争着去讲。
    （二）便于党委及时地了解兼职支部教员的工作情况和整个支部教育工作的进展，也便于党委及时地了解党员的思想情况，及时地指导工作。如通县一区兼职支部教员到支部讲课时，发现有的党员在互助组内有剥削别人的行为，用一个骡子顶三个人工，其他党员和群众都不满；又发现有的党员以为党员不许雇工，就错误地认为群众也不许雇工。像这些问题填到卡片上，便可以帮助党委及时了解情况，立即采取措施，纠正偏差，正确地贯彻政策。又如鸡泽县委发现兼职支部教员王进义，把不允许党员当富农的问题讲错了，县委便立即指示区委纠正。
    （三）推动了干部学习理论、政策和实际。过去有些干部常因工作忙而放松学习。就是学习时也常是走马观花，不求甚解。实行了卡片制度以后，督促支部教员必须认真地给支部讲课，这样就必须作好课前的准备工作，明了每课的中心和要点，领会它的精神实质。这样一来，就逐渐养成干部深入钻研文件的习惯，推动了干部学习。如王明珍同志说：“过去我学习都是马马虎虎，这一填卡片，再马虎可不行了。这就得好好准备课，仔细研究课文重点与怎样联系实际。”
    领导上必须解决的几个问题
    各地执行卡片制度的经验证明：要想贯彻执行卡片制度，保证支部教育工作的经常化，党委宣传部在领导上必须解决以下几个问题：
    （一）在推行卡片制度之前，必须认真地审查兼职支部教员的条件，并作好充分的思想动员工作。不够条件者不聘请，不要滥竽充数。应使兼职支部教员认识到：“每个共产党员除从事社会职业之外，都必须在党的一个组织的分配之下担负一种工作”，是共产党员的义务。应向支部教员说明实行卡片制度的作用和意义，以纠正作兼职支部教员是
    “额外负担”、填卡片是多一道手续等错误认识。经验证明，凡是思想动员工作作的好，克服了错误认识，卡片制度就能坚持，成绩就大。如石家庄地委区的灵寿、建屏、平山等县，绝大多数兼职支部教员都能执行卡片制度，他们不仅不认为是个“麻烦”和“额外负担”，而且认为实行卡片制度有更多的好处和方便。有的县（如平山）政府科长、银行主任等较负责的干部，即使没有按时到支部教育传授站（或到支部）讲课，也能主动地去补课或向主管部门说明理由。又如大名、魏县有的地方是两个兼职支部教员共同包教一个支部，他们都争着到支部讲课。反之，如果不从思想动员解决思想问题作起，使其自觉地负起教育责任来，只是用组织命令催逼讲课的办法，就不可能作好。如保定地委统战部干事宋维棋同志，没从思想上动员好，只是在组织上的催促下，去讲过一次课。后来督促的紧了，就提出自己的工作忙，兼作支部教员是“额外负担”，要求辞退兼职支部教员。又如通县地委有的兼职支部教员，认为实行卡片制度是“多这一道子”，嫌“麻烦”。栾城县委宣传部长甚至也这样认识。这样就不可能坚持卡片制度，搞好支部教育工作。
    （二）由于目前兼职支部教员政治文化水平一般都比较低，对支部教育工作不熟悉，加上教材内容政治思想性与政策原则性强，兼职支部教员自己如果了解得不深刻，到支部讲课时就不够大胆。所以领导方面必须定期地及时地给兼职支部教员上预备课，帮助他们研究教材重点，使他们明了讲课目的；及时地加强业务指导，具体地帮助他们研究、改进教学方法，解决支部教育工作中的困难问题。灵寿、平山、建屏等县这样做了后，兼职支部教员都感到“有办法了”，因而积极性也提高了。有的县没有这样做，就使得支部教育工作形成自流。
    （三）党委宣传部对教员交上的“卡片”，应该认真地处理，定期地总结，并对教员进行表扬和批评。平山、获鹿等县这样做了，很多兼职支部教员说：“咱做的工作怎样，上级都知道。”平山县供销合作社秘书安润身同志当了兼职支部教员后，工作起初很积极，后来不积极了，实行了卡片制度以后，他又积极起来。获鹿县派出所所长孟同维一贯对支部教育工作积极，县里通报表扬了他，他更积极了。现在他一人包着给两个支部上课，从来没有间断过一次。该县一区（城关区）区委书记也包了一个支部，因没有执行卡片制度，未能按时上课。当区委会检讨支部教育工作时，他作了自我批评；现在建立了卡片制度，也能按时讲课了。相反的，有些县对交回的卡片不作处理，教员也就逐渐不交了，讲课也不经常了，支部教育工作也就涣散下来。
    （四）要正确规定“卡片”上的项目。“卡片”的项目，各地委和县委很不一致。有的过于简单，反映不出问题，起不了应有的作用；有的过于繁杂，因为兼职支部教员文化水平低，填不了，而且填起来浪费时间。我们根据对各地“卡片”项目的研究，认为除应有时间、地点、听课人数三项外，还应包括以下几个项目：（1）讲课的内容要点；（2）发现的问题；（3）党员反映；（4）讲课的优缺点；（5）支书（或支委）的意见。这五项能填好，可以使党委看出支部教育的全貌，掌握党员的思想情况，便于指导工作。最后一项，看起来似乎不重要，但如能认真执行，却会推动支部党员监督兼职支部教员的工作。如大名六区兼职支部教员韩寿先，自己有“老资格”的思想包袱，对讲课满不在乎，课前不准备，到支部按课文念念就算完事。结果党员不满意，给他提出意见，说他讲的“不联系实际，搬原文”，并给他填到“卡片”上，要他一定交给上级党委。“卡片”交到县委后，县委指出了他的缺点，他认识了错误，转变了“老资格”满不在乎的错误思想，就认真地学习起来了。
    现将通县地委兼职支部教员的一张授课卡片附在后面，供大家参考：（附图表）
