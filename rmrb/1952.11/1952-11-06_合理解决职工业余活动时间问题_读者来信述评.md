    Reasonably Resolve the Issue of Employees' Leisure Time Activities
    ——Reader's Letters and Commentary

    Today, this column publishes three letters from employees of the Shijingshan Power Plant. From these letters, we can see that reasonably resolving the issue of employees' leisure time activities is an urgent requirement of the leadership of the Party, administration, trade union, and Communist Youth League at all levels in factories and enterprises, as well as among the masses. It is also an important issue directly related to the production and work of factories and enterprises, the physical health of employees, and their political, cultural, and technical studies. At the same time, we can also see from these three letters that as long as leading cadres are determined, get through to the thinking of grassroots cadres, boldly promote cadres, and strictly adhere to the uniformly stipulated meeting system, the problem of employees' leisure time activities can be reasonably resolved and good results can be achieved.

    Before the reasonable resolution of the issue of leisure time activities at the Shijingshan Power Plant, cadres were unable to delve deeply into their work due to excessive concurrent positions. Workers were unable to recover from fatigue due to insufficient rest time, and therefore could not concentrate on production. Apprentice Lin Xiuqing was also directly affected in his technical and cultural studies due to excessive extracurricular activities. Therefore, in order to ensure that employees have sufficient rest and study time, which is to create the necessary conditions for improving production, the phenomenon of excessive extracurricular activities, excessive meetings, and excessive concurrent positions of cadres must be reasonably resolved and can be. Although this issue has now been basically resolved at the Shijingshan Power Plant under the leadership of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, similar situations still exist to varying degrees not only in Beijing but also in factories and enterprises in other regions. Therefore, reasonably resolving the issue of employees' leisure time activities should be a current political task for factories and enterprises in all regions.

    How can employees' leisure time activities be reasonably resolved?

    First of all, the leading cadres of the Party, administration, trade union, and Communist Youth League at all levels in factories and enterprises must ideologically recognize the importance of resolving this issue. Recognize that ensuring employees have sufficient rest and study time is not only a matter of mass perspective, but also an important issue directly related to whether production in the enterprise can be improved, whether employees' physical health can be maintained and enhanced, and whether employees' political, technical, and cultural studies can be guaranteed.

    Secondly, boldly promoting cadres is an important link in reasonably resolving the issue of employees' leisure time activities. If employees hold too many concurrent positions, they will naturally have too many extracurricular activities. Therefore, it is very necessary to restrict employees' concurrent positions. The decision of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China on protecting employees' health and reasonably allocating employees' leisure time stipulates important provisions such as each person can only hold one position concurrently, with a maximum of no more than two positions, and the large-scale promotion of cadres. The Shijingshan Power Plant boldly promoted cadres, which basically resolved the issue of concurrent positions.

    Third, strictly adhere to the uniformly stipulated system of leisure time activities. With a uniformly stipulated leisure time activity schedule, leading cadres at all levels will have to streamline unnecessary meetings, avoid holding unprepared and repetitive meetings, and rationally allocate leisure time activities with a focus on priorities in order to more effectively leverage the role of this fixed time. All levels must formulate this system well and strictly adhere to it to ensure its implementation.

    Fourth, publicize the relevant systems and decisions on this issue and mobilize the masses to supervise. The decision of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China on reasonably allocating employees' leisure time stipulates this point and explicitly states that "if the meeting does not end on time, the masses have the right to leave the meeting." If the masses do not participate, no activities can be carried out, which is a very effective method.

    At present, the production of factories and enterprises in various regions has generally been on the right track, and the country's large-scale economic construction is about to begin. Therefore, reasonably resolving the issue of employees' leisure time activities and ensuring that employees have sufficient rest and study time should attract the serious attention of leading cadres in factories and enterprises in various regions. We hope that Party committees at all levels can formulate practical decisions to resolve this issue based on the different circumstances of factories and enterprises in various regions and implement them on a trial basis.

    合理解决职工业余活动时间问题
    ——读者来信述评
    本栏今天发表了石景山发电厂职工的三封来信，从来信中，我们可以看出：合理解决职工业余活动时间的问题，是当前工厂、企业的党、行政、工会、青年团各系统领导方面和群众方面的迫切要求，也是直接关系工厂、企业生产和工作，职工的身体健康，以及政治、文化、技术等学习的重要问题。同时，我们从这三封来信中，也可以看出：只要领导干部下定决心，打通基层干部的思想，放手提拔干部，严格掌握统一规定的会议制度，职工业余活动时间的问题是可以合理解决，并能收到良好效果的。
    石景山发电厂在合理解决职工业余活动时间以前，干部因为兼职过多，工作没法深入；工人因为没有足够的休息时间，疲劳不能恢复，生产时也就不能集中精力。徒工林秀清也因为业余活动过多，以致直接影响到他的技术和文化学习。因此，为了保障职工有足够的休息和学习时间，也就是为了创造提高生产的必要条件，职工业余活动过多、会议过多、干部兼职过多的现象，必须得到而且可能得到合理的解决。石景山发电厂在中共北京市委的领导下，这个问题现在虽然已经得到了基本解决。但类似情况不仅在北京、同时在其他地区的工厂、企业中也还或多或少地存在着，所以合理解决职工业余活动时间问题，应该是各地工厂、企业当前的一个政治任务。
    职工业余活动时间怎样才能得到合理的解决呢？
    首先，工厂、企业的党、行政、工会、青年团各系统的领导干部，必须从思想上认识到解决这一问题的重要性。认识到保证职工有足够的休息时间和学习时间，不仅是一个群众观点问题，而且也是直接关系到企业中的生产能否搞好，职工身体健康能否保持和增进，职工的政治、技术、文化学习能否保证的重要问题。
    其次，放手提拔干部是合理解决职工业余活动时间问题的重要环节。职工兼职太多，业余活动自然也就过多，因而限制职工的兼职就非常必要。中共北京市委关于保护职工健康，合理支配职工业余活动时间的决定中，规定了每人只能兼一个职务，最多不得超过两个职务，以及大量提拔干部的重要条文。石景山发电厂放手提拔了干部，使兼职问题得到了基本解决。
    第三，严格掌握统一规定的业余活动时间的制度。有了统一规定的业余活动时间，就能使得各系统的领导干部不得不精简不必要的会议、不开无准备和重复的会议，不得不分别轻重缓急，有中心有重点地合理支配业余活动时间，以更有效地发挥这一定的时间的作用。各系统必须很好地规定出这一制度，而且严格地掌握，以保证这一制度的贯彻。
    第四，公布有关这一问题的制度和决定，发动群众来监督。中共北京市委关于合理支配职工业余活动时间的决定，就规定了这一条，并明确地提出了“会议到时如不结束，群众有自由退席的权利”。只要群众不参加，任何活动也就不能进行了，这是非常有效的办法。
    目前各地工厂、企业的生产，一般说来，大体已走上正轨，而国家大规模的经济建设即将开始，所以，合理解决职工业余活动时间，保证职工有足够的休息和学习时间，是应该引起各地工厂、企业领导干部的严重注意的。我们希望各级党委能够根据各地工厂、企业的不同情况，作出切合实际的解决这一问题的决定来试行。
