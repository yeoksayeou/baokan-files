Zhangjiakou People's Construction Company Studies Advanced Soviet Experience
Promotes Segmented Parallel Assembly Line Method to Improve Work Efficiency

The Zhangjiakou People's Construction Company adopted the advanced Soviet experience of segmented parallel assembly line methods at a certain construction site, greatly improving work efficiency and completing the original construction plan one month ahead of schedule before the ground froze.

The construction site's project was large in scale. This year's construction plan included the main part of seven reinforced concrete three-story buildings – the roof project. Because the preparatory work was not completed on time, the start date was delayed. According to the general faster construction progress, it would not be completed until the end of November, but the local area begins to freeze in early November every year.

In early September, the Zhangjiakou People's Construction Company launched a movement to study advanced Soviet experience and complete construction tasks. After studying the specific conditions of the project, the management and technical personnel of the construction site realized that although the workers were very active in construction, and the labor efficiency of individual types of work was constantly improving, due to the lack of close labor organization, many types of work often could not proceed in parallel. For example, after concrete workers and rebar workers finished all the floor slabs on one floor, the bricklayers would begin to build the walls, and the concrete workers and rebar workers would wait on the sidelines. When the bricklayers built all the outer walls to the window sills, the carpenters, rebar workers, and concrete workers would start making window sill formwork, tying rebar, and pouring concrete, etc., and then the bricklayers would wait. Doing things step by step like this wasted a lot of time. The advanced Soviet segmented parallel assembly line method just happened to lack these shortcomings. Its basic characteristics are: segmented construction of each floor, cyclical operation between work sections, close connection between types of work, and simultaneous construction engineering and indoor installation. These principles greatly inspired the engineering and technical personnel of the construction site. They immediately re-formulated the construction plan, allocated labor, and divided and organized the work sections and procedures for each floor, and began segmented parallel assembly line operations. As a result, the above-mentioned shortcomings were eliminated. They divided each floor of the building into two work sections, the front half and the back half, and started circulating and performing parallel operations from the front half. For example, for a reinforced concrete floor slab of 1,400 square meters on one floor, after the concrete workers poured the concrete on the front half, they would turn to the back half to pour concrete. When the concrete solidified, they would mark the wall line and erect door jambs. At this time, the bricklayers would begin to build the front half of the outer wall, and the carpenters would also make formwork, supports, and beams for the next floor slab. When the back half of the concrete floor slab was poured, the bricklayers in the front half had built the outer wall to the window sills, and they would turn to the back half to build the outer wall. The carpenters would switch from making formwork and supports for the front half to making window sill formwork on the outer wall of the front half, the rebar workers would follow the carpenters to tie rebar, and the concrete workers would follow to pour window sill concrete. When the window sill concrete in the front half had solidified, the outer wall in the back half had been built to the window sills, so the bricklayers would turn to the front half to build the second section of the outer wall to the lintel. At the same time, the carpenters, rebar workers, and concrete workers would begin the assembly line cycle of making formwork, beams, and window sills for the back half. After the ground floor project was completed, the construction of the upper floor project began repeatedly.

This not only effectively eliminated the phenomenon of wasted work between types of work and work procedures, but also greatly improved work efficiency. For example, in the past, it took 22 days and 1,400 workers to build a reinforced concrete building with a floor area of 1,400 square meters; now it only takes 10 days, and the number of workers used is also reduced by half compared to the past. At the same time, with the promotion of the new operation method, the construction management and technical guidance work also adopted the method of specialized personnel being responsible for division of labor and cooperation, so the construction quality has also been greatly improved.

    张家口市人民建筑公司学习苏联先进经验
    推行分段平行流水作业法提高工作效率
    张家口市人民建筑公司某工地推行分段平行流水作业法的苏联先进经验，大大提高了工作效率，使原订施工计划在结冻以前就提前一个月完成。
    某工地工程规模较大，今年施工计划包括七幢钢筋洋灰结构的三层大厦的主要部分——屋顶工程。因事前的准备工作没能按时做好，延迟了开工日期，如按照一般较快的施工进度，也要到十一月底才能完工，可是当地每年十一月初旬就开始结冻。
    九月初，张家口市人民建筑公司发动了学习苏联先进经验完成建筑任务的运动。该工地管理和技术人员结合本工程的具体情况进行学习后，发觉施工中虽然工人们都很积极，个别工种的劳动效率也不断提高，但是由于劳动组织不紧密，许多工种常常不能齐头并进，如洋灰工、钢筋工全部打完一层的楼板后，瓦工才开始砌墙，洋灰工和钢筋工就在一边等着；瓦工将外墙都砌到窗盘处时，木工、钢筋工、洋灰工开始作窗盘模型板，扎钢筋，打洋灰等等，这时砌砖工也就等着。这样一步一步地跟着来，中间就浪费了许多时间。而苏联先进的分段平行流水作业法恰巧没有这些缺点。它的基本特点是：每层建筑分段施工、工段之间循环作业、工种之间紧密衔接、建筑工程和房内安装等工作同时进行。这些原理给了该工地工程技术人员很大启发，他们当即重新拟定施工计划和配备劳动力，划分和组织了每层建筑的工段工序，开始进行分段平行流水作业。结果，上述缺点都被消灭。他们把每层楼房分做前半部与后半部两个工段，从前半部开始循环并进行平行作业，如一层一千四百平方公尺的钢筋洋灰楼板，洋灰工打好前半部洋灰后就转到后半部打洋灰，待洋灰凝固时，就放墙身线，立门档；这时瓦工就开始砌前半部的外墙，同时木工也就做上一层楼板的模型板、支柱、架梁等工作。当后半部的洋灰楼板打好后，前半部的瓦工已砌外墙到窗盘处，就转到后半部砌外墙；而木工则由做前半部的模型板、支柱等转到前半部外墙作窗盘模型板，钢筋工则追随着木工扎钢筋，洋灰工也跟进来打窗盘洋灰。当前半部的窗盘洋灰已经凝固时，后半部的外墙已砌到窗盘处，于是瓦工便转到前半部砌第二段外墙到过梁。同时木工、钢筋工、洋灰工也就开始了后半部楼板模型板、架梁、窗盘等项工作的流水循环作业。待底层工程做完以后，就周而复始的开始了上一层的建筑工程。
    这样不只有效地消除了工种与工序之间的窝工现象，而且大大提高了工作效率。如在过去作一层
    一千四百平方公尺的钢筋洋灰结构的楼房，需要二十二天、一千四百个工；现在只用十天的时间就够了，所用工数也比过去减少了一半。同时，施工管理和技术指导工作也随着新作业法的推行，采取了各工种专人负责分工合作的办法，因而在建筑质量上也有很大提高。（据新华社讯）
