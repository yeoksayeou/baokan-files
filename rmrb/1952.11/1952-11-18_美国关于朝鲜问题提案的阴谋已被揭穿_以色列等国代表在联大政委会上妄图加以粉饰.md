Xinhua News Agency, New York, 17th Dispatch from TASS: The United Nations General Assembly's Political Committee, which adjourned after the speech by the head of the Soviet delegation, Vyshinsky, on the 10th, reconvened on the 14th to continue discussing the Korean issue.

American newspapers report that the U.S. delegation held consultations with delegations from other countries participating in the U.S. war of aggression against Korea during the recess.

According to the "New York Times," these delegations considered many subtle issues related to the Korean question under discussion at the United Nations in those consultations and attempted to draft a "new plan" because the original U.S. proposal had been exposed and had not received the support of many delegations.

American newspapers also report that the U.S. delegation is increasing pressure on those countries' delegations that are trying to find a way to break the deadlock created by the U.S. military command on the Korean armistice issue. The "New York Times" reported that the U.S. delegation held talks with representatives of many countries again on the 14th. The purpose of the recent activities of the United States is to include certain suggestions formally or privately put forward by certain delegations into the U.S. proposal as bait, as a superficial "revision" of the U.S. proposal that cannot be accepted by many delegations. The leaders of the U.S. delegation are trying to use this method to obtain the necessary majority to pass their proposal to reject a peaceful settlement of the Korean question.

At the committee meeting on the 14th, the Israeli representative attempted to gloss over the U.S. proposal. He expressed dissatisfaction with many proposals on the Korean issue and pointed out the danger of differences of opinion among the delegations. He advocated organizing an "editorial committee" to synthesize all the proposals. The U.S. delegation, apparently afraid of not being able to muster the necessary votes to pass its proposal, attempted to get Mexico and Peru to withdraw their proposals and put some of the wording of these two countries' proposals into the U.S. proposal.

The Israeli representative's speech shows that he is trying to rely on such an "editorial committee" to slightly modify the U.S. proposal in wording and rush it to the General Assembly for approval, so that the General Assembly will approve the U.S.'s forced detention of Korean and Chinese prisoners of war.

Referring to the Soviet proposal to establish a committee to peacefully resolve the Korean issue, the Israeli representative did not dare to openly oppose the proposal, but only suggested that the General Assembly not vote on the Soviet proposal at this meeting. He said that the Soviet Union's suggestion in the proposal to establish a committee could be studied by a special meeting of the General Assembly, and that the committee should meet after an armistice was reached in Korea.

Pakistani Foreign Minister Zafrullah Khan warned the committee not to draft a "literal plan" that only looks like an agreement on the surface but is not actually an agreement.

The Pakistani representative did not doubt the right of prisoners of war to be repatriated, and he pointed out that the agreement should be based on the provisions of the 1949 Geneva Convention. However, he expressed opposition to "forced" repatriation, although it is well known that this is just a hypocritical excuse used to cover up the refusal of the U.S. military command to repatriate prisoners of war.

Zafrullah Khan expressed his hope that the Korean War should be stopped first, regardless of whether an agreement has been reached on the prisoner-of-war issue. However, he did not put forward any way to get the armistice negotiations out of the dead end into which they had been driven by the U.S. military command.

The committee continued to discuss the Korean issue on the 15th. Only the Mexican representative, Nájera, spoke at the meeting. He warned the committee that any attempt to force the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the headquarters of the Chinese People's Volunteers to accept an unacceptable resolution would be futile. He admitted that such an attempt would give a bad impression to world opinion, and he specifically said: It is dangerous to put forward conditions that are known in advance to be unacceptable to the other party, because it gives people reason to accuse the United Nations of failing in its efforts to achieve an armistice and establish peace in Korea.

The Mexican representative tried hard to defend Mexico's proposal on the Korean issue in his speech. But he was unable to refute any of the reasons given by Vyshinsky against the Mexican proposal. It is known that Vyshinsky convincingly explained in his speech on the 10th that the most important part of the Mexican proposal, the repatriation of prisoners of war, deviates from the Geneva Convention and violates the basic principles of international law that require the unconditional repatriation of all prisoners of war.

By emphasizing his support for the basic principles of the U.S. proposal, the Mexican representative once again proved that the Soviet delegation leader's criticism of the Mexican proposal was correct.

### 美国关于朝鲜问题提案的阴谋已被揭穿  以色列等国代表在联大政委会上妄图加以粉饰

    美国关于朝鲜问题提案的阴谋已被揭穿
    以色列等国代表在联大政委会上妄图加以粉饰
    【新华社十七日讯】据塔斯社纽约讯：在十日苏联代表团团长维辛斯基发表演说以后即行休会的联合国大会政治委员会，于十四日复会，继续讨论朝鲜问题。
    美国报纸报道：美国代表团在休会期间曾与参加美国侵略朝鲜战争的其他国家的代表团进行商谈。
    据“纽约时报”报道：这些代表团在那几次商谈里考虑了许多与联合国讨论的朝鲜问题有关的微妙问题，并企图拟订一个“新方案”，因为原有的美国提案已被揭露，并且没有得到许多代表团的支持。
    美国报纸并报道，美国代表团正在对那些企图设法打破美军司令部在朝鲜停战问题上造成的僵局的各国代表团增加压力。“纽约时报”报道，美国代表团在十四日又与许多国家代表举行会谈。美国最近活动的目的是要把某些代表团正式或私下提出的某些建议包括到美国提案中去，以此作为钓饵，就算在外表上“修正了”不能为许多代表团接受的美国提案。美国代表团的领导者企图用这种办法来取得必要的多数票，使委员会通过他们提出的拒绝和平解决朝鲜问题的提案。
    在委员会十四日会议上，以色列代表企图粉饰美国的提案。他对许多关于朝鲜问题的提案都表示不满，并指出代表团之间意见分歧的危险性。他主张组织一个“编辑委员会”来综合所有的提案。美国代表团显然是因为害怕不能凑足必要的票数来通过它的提案，于是企图要墨西哥和秘鲁撤销它们的提案，而把这两国的提案的一些词句放到美国提案里去。
    以色列代表的发言说明，他企图靠这样一个“编辑委员会”来把美国提案稍微在文字上修改一下，就急忙交给大会通过，使大会批准美国强迫扣留朝中战俘。
    在谈到主张设立一个委员会来和平解决朝鲜问题的苏联提案的时候，以色列代表不敢公开反对这个提案，只提议大会不在这次会议上表决苏联的提案。他说，苏联在提案中建议设立一个委员会一事可以由大会的一次特别会议来研究，这个委员会应在朝鲜获致停战以后再开会。
    巴基斯坦外交部长查弗鲁拉汗警告委员会不要拟订一种只在表面上看来像是一种协议，而实际上并不是协议的“文字上的方案”。
    这位巴基斯坦代表并不怀疑战俘有被遣返的权利，他指出协议应该以一九四九年日内瓦公约的规定为基础。可是，他表示反对“强迫”遣返，虽然人们都知道，这不过是用来掩饰美军司令部拒绝遣返战俘的一种虚伪的遁词。
    查弗鲁拉汗表示希望不管是否已就战俘问题达成协议，应先停止朝鲜战争。不过，他对如何使停战谈判走出被美军司令部驱入的死路，并未提出什么办法来。
    委员会在十五日继续讨论朝鲜问题。仅有墨西哥代表纳孚一人在会上发言。他警告委员会说：任何强使朝鲜民主主义人民共和国与中国人民志愿军司令部接受一项使人不能接受的决议的企图，都是徒然的。他承认这种企图将给世界舆论以不良印象，他并具体地说：如果提出在事先明知道不能为对方接受的条件，这样做是危险的，因为它使人们有理由来指责联合国获致停战与建立朝鲜和平的努力失败了。
    墨西哥代表竭力在发言中为墨西哥关于朝鲜问题的提案辩解。但是他无法驳倒维辛斯基所说明的反对墨西哥提案的理由中的任何一个。大家知道，维辛斯基在十日的演说中令人信服地说明，墨西哥提案中关于遣返战俘这个最重要的部分，脱离了日内瓦公约，并违反了要求无条件遣返全部战俘的国际法基本原则。
    墨西哥代表在强调说明他支持美国提案的基本原则的时候，再度证明了苏联代表团团长对墨西哥提案所作的批评是正确的。
