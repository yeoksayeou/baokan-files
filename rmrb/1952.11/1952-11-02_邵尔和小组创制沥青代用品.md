    Shao Er and Group Create Asphalt Substitute
    Editor: The Shao Er group of the Electrolysis Workshop of the state-owned Tianjin Chemical Factory mainly uses asphalt (composed of hard asphalt, soft asphalt, coal tar, cattle hair, and acidic white clay) to seal electrolytic tanks. Because the asphalt contains a high degree of toxicity, employee poisoning incidents occurred continuously. During the Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement, Communist Party member Shao Er led all the group's employees in studying how to replace asphalt with non-toxic materials. After many trials, it was proven that a mixture of cattle hair, acidic white clay, butter, and machine oil could replace asphalt in sealing electrolytic tank seams. This invention ensured the health of the workers and also saved a lot of money for the country.

    邵尔和小组创制沥青代用品
    编辑同志：国营天津化学工厂电解车间邵尔和小组，他们的主要工作是用沥青（由硬沥青、软沥青、煤焦油、牛毛、酸性白土混合而成）封闭解电槽。因为沥青质含有很大毒性，就不断发生职工中毒事件。在增产节约运动中，共产党员邵尔和领导全组职工，研究如何用没有毒的物品代替沥青。经过多次试制，证明了用牛毛、酸性白土、黄油、机器油混合物可以代替沥青封闭电解槽缝。这个发明，保证了工人身体健康，也为国家节约了很多钱。    李平
