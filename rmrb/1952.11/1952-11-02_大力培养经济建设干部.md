    Vigorously Train Economic Construction Cadres
    In order to carry out large-scale national economic construction, training a large number of economic work cadres who can master technology and are proficient in business has become our urgent task. Taking industry as an example, the current situation is that production management is far behind the needs of production development, and the level of leadership is far behind the production enthusiasm of workers. In terms of basic construction, from geological surveys and design to construction and machine installation, there is a general feeling of a shortage of cadres, especially technical cadres. Some construction projects cannot be started quickly because of a lack of design capabilities, and some projects have caused waste and losses due to weak cadre strength. Other economic sectors also feel the lack of economic construction talent. All this shows how urgently it is necessary to quickly train a large number of cadres in economic construction work.
    How to solve this urgent problem? Relying on the training of regular specialized schools is one method, but it is far from meeting the current needs of the country. Therefore, we must grasp the characteristics of the early stage of revolutionary construction, adopt revolutionary methods, and have governments at all levels, economic departments, and factories and mines work together. In this regard, the method of the Northeast People's Government's directly affiliated departments and provinces and cities to formulate long-term cadre training plans in a prepared manner, the method of the Tianjin Electrical, Mechanical, and Financial and Economic Industrial Systems and Tianjin Steel Plant to trial run regular worker technical evening schools under the leadership and assistance of the Municipal Education Bureau and the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, and the method of Anshan Iron and Steel Company in Northeast China to systematically train technical personnel from workers, are all worth learning. Other regions and economic construction departments should also quickly step up this work.
    At present, some departments and enterprises have not recognized the importance of training cadres. Although they also know that the existing cadres are not enough, they just reach out to the leading organs, rather than trying to train them themselves. When the leading organs ask them to send on-the-job cadres and workers to study, they are unwilling, fearing that it will affect the completion of production tasks and fearing that it will "ruin" the original enterprises. This kind of thinking is wrong and must be corrected. If we do not actively prepare conditions for the upcoming large-scale economic construction and vigorously train economic construction cadres today, we will commit political errors. Governments at all levels, economic construction organs at all levels, and factories and mines should regard training cadres as one of the current central tasks, and any hesitation is unacceptable.

### 大力培养经济建设干部

    大力培养经济建设干部
    为了进行国家的大规模经济建设，培养大量能掌握技术、精通业务的经济工作干部，已成为我们目前的迫切任务。仅以工业来说，现在的情况是：生产经营管理工作远远落后于生产发展的需要，领导水平远远落后于工人的生产积极性。在基本建设方面，从地质调查、设计、施工到安装机器，更普遍地感到干部特别是技术干部的不足，有些建设工程因为没有设计力量而不能很快施工，有些工程则因干部力量薄弱而造成了浪费和损失。其他经济部门，也都感到经济建设人才的缺乏。这一切都说明了，迅速培养大量的经济建设工作中的干部，是如何迫切的需要。
    怎样解决这个迫切的问题呢？依靠正规的专门学校的培养是一个办法，但它远远不能满足国家目前的需要。因此我们必须掌握革命建设初期的特点，采取革命的办法，各级政府、各经济部门和厂矿企业一齐动手来办。在这方面，东北人民政府直属各部门及各省、市有准备地制订长期培养和训练干部计划的办法，天津市电气、机械和财经三产业系统及天津钢厂等，在市教育局、市总工会的领导和协助下，试办正规的工人技术业余学校的办法，以及东北鞍山钢铁公司有计划地从工人中培养技术人员的办法，都是值得学习的。其它地区和经济建设部门，也应该迅速加紧进行这项工作。
    现在，还有些部门和企业单位没有认识培养干部的重要。虽然他们也知道现有的干部不够，但只是伸手向领导机关要，而不是自己设法培养。当领导机关要他们派在职的干部和工人去学习时，他们就不愿意，怕影响生产任务的完成，怕“搞垮”原有的企业。这种思想是错误的，必须纠正。如果今天不积极地为即将来到的大规模经济建设准备条件，大量培养经济建设干部，那将会犯政治错误的。各级政府、各级经济建设机关及厂矿企业，应把培养干部作为目前的中心任务之一，任何迟疑都是要不得的。
