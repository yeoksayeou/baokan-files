    The Problem of Amateur Activities of Employees of Shijingshan Power Plant Has Been Reasonably Resolved

    Editor: The problem of Shijingshan Power Plant employees having long amateur activity hours, many meetings, and cadres holding multiple positions has now been fundamentally improved. This improvement has played an extremely positive role in protecting the health of employees, increasing production efficiency, strengthening employee learning, and improving work methods.

    In 1950 and early 1951, our factory employees had excessive amateur activity hours, and there were many chaotic meetings, with cadres overlapping and holding multiple positions. At that time, amateur activity time was generally 16 hours per week for ordinary workers and about 20 hours for cadres and activists. This resulted in excessive fatigue for employees and low work efficiency. Operators attended too many meetings, lacked sleep, and would doze off while watching the machines; some were afraid of being criticized for dozing off, so they wiped the floor to stimulate their spirits; some fell asleep in the toilet. There were so many meetings that a party branch secretary held seven positions concurrently, and frequently had to attend 27 hours of meetings in one week during his spare time. Party branch committee members often met until 2 a.m. on Saturdays and continued on Sundays.

    The reasons for this situation were, objectively: there were many political movements at the time, heavy tasks, and new work almost every day. In addition, our factory had established many new institutions over the years, implemented a branch-based responsibility system, and the Party, the Communist Youth League, and the trade union all established organizations according to workshops, and all aspects needed cadres. However, few cadres in our factory came from the old liberated areas, and the newly promoted cadres, although enthusiastic, lacked methods, so the leading cadres relied on meetings to solve problems. On the other hand, subjectively: at that time, there was no understanding or experience in how to save meeting time. In particular, I came from the countryside and was accustomed to the rural working method of "working in the fields during the day and holding meetings at night." In fact, this was a lack of understanding of the intensive labor of workers in the production process, and it was also a reflection of a weak mass perspective.

    In 1951, the higher authorities criticized our excessive meetings as "desperate measures." In our actual work, we also increasingly deeply felt the seriousness of this problem. After more than a year of effort, this problem has now been relatively thoroughly resolved in our factory. We have taken the following measures to solve it:

    Oppose Simple Utilization, Boldly Promote Cadres

    1. Cultivate and promote cadres to solve the problem of cadres holding too many positions concurrently. Among the large number of operators in our factory, there used to be only one Communist Party member. The Party wanted him to do Party work, the Communist Youth League wanted him to be the secretary of the Youth League branch, and the trade union assigned him positions such as cultural and educational committee member, singing team leader, club worker, and trade union group leader. Everyone wanted to snatch good cadres, and no one was willing to painstakingly cultivate cadres. We criticized this simple utilization view of "using good cadres more and leaving bad ones aside," and boldly promoted a group of cadres. Now, cadres promoted to the level of section or stock are about 7.5 percent of the total number of workers in the factory. In the past, political class tutors were all concurrently served by Party branch committee members, but now they are replaced by Party member workers. As long as we strengthen their ideological education and specific assistance, they are fully capable. Wang Zuoming, the newly appointed labor protection committee member of the electrical workshop trade union, went deep into the families of employees during the invention award, investigated which families lacked quilts and which lacked thermos bottles, and then issued awards according to each person's needs, with very good results. Facts have proved that the workers who were most oppressed in the old society, once they have the opportunity to develop their talents, they will work with a very full revolutionary enthusiasm. After a large number of cadres were promoted, now all cadres above the level of workshop director in our factory, except for one person, do not hold concurrent positions. Below the workshop director level, 66 cadres hold one concurrent position, and six people hold two concurrent positions. With the problem of concurrent positions resolved, the joint meetings of Party branch secretaries, the joint meetings of workshop trade union chairmen, and the joint meetings of Communist Youth League branch secretaries can be held separately at one time. This makes it possible to solve the problem of cadres attending too many meetings.

    Uniformly Allocate Amateur Activity Time

    2. Reduce some unnecessary meetings and uniformly and rationally allocate amateur activity time. In the past, every time a production plan was deployed, a Party branch secretary had to attend six or seven meetings with the same content. For example, he attended the Party's general branch committee, participated in the factory management committee and the workers' representative meeting, and then he conveyed these plans and decisions to the branch committee and the branch meeting. After the branch meeting, he had to hold a workshop mass meeting, and finally he had to go deep into the group meeting to listen to the masses' reactions. Now we are determined to change this practice. After the branch secretary conveys the general branch's plan to the workshop, the workshop meeting is presided over by the workshop trade union chairman, and the branch secretary and branch committee members do not participate. In the past, at the Red Flag Award ceremony, the Party, the administration, the trade union, and the Communist Youth League all took the stage to give a speech with the same content. Labor models and technicians then went up to talk about how to respond to the call. Each workshop then launched a challenge competition, so each meeting took three and a half hours. The workers said, "I look forward to you saying the meeting is adjourned, and I'll take my legs and leave." This time, the factory changed the method of awarding bonuses. The bonus was issued to the workshop at the conference, and then the workshop issued it to the individual. It was finished during the trade union activity time, and it cultivated and improved the prestige of the workshop cadres. Now, the amateur activity time of the Party, the administration, the Communist Youth League, and the trade union is uniformly allocated by the Party general branch every week. What meeting to hold at what time is scheduled and announced for the masses to supervise. When a meeting is held, the meeting time is announced. If the meeting is not finished by the time, the masses can freely withdraw. Meetings not in the plan must be approved by the Party general branch before they can be held.

    Reasonably Stipulate Study Time and Content

    3. Streamline the study time. The first method is: cultural classes are reduced from six hours to four hours, and technical classes are reduced from three hours to two hours. Change the past situation of talking too much, no time for review, and trying to swallow more than one can chew. The second method is: learn one thing before learning another. Workers with a primary school level learn the quick literacy method in batches, eight hours a week, and then rotate another batch; those with a higher primary school level go to evening school; those with a junior high school level or above go to junior and senior theory classes or technical classes respectively; cadres with low cultural levels go to cadre quick cultural classes. In this way, cultural classes, theory classes, and cadre cultural classes can be held separately at the same time. This changed the past situation of learning this and learning that, and as a result, "the chicken flew away and the egg was broken."

    Centralized Accommodation for Leading Cadres in Each System

    4. Centralized accommodation. The Party branch secretaries, field directors, Communist Youth League branch secretaries, and workshop trade union chairmen of each production unit in our factory mostly live together in one place. This room has become the activity center for Party members, League members, and the masses in this workshop. Cadres living together can discuss problems at any time, reducing the time for meetings and discussions, and the Party general branch can easily educate them. The faster progressing cadres in our factory, such as labor model Liu Dezhen, were among the first to move to the factory for centralized accommodation.

    New Gains

    As a result of the rational allocation of employees' amateur activity time, the general masses (accounting for 50.3% of the total number of employees) have about 8 to 10 hours of amateur activity time per week, activists (accounting for 43.5% of the total number of employees) have 10 to 12 hours of amateur activity time per week, and Party and League branch committee members, workshop trade union committee members, section chiefs, and field directors have 13 to 14 hours of amateur activity time per week. 93.8% of the employees in the factory can rest at 9:30 p.m. and only start activities at 6:30 a.m. The benefits of this are: employees are no longer overworked, are in high spirits, have enough time to think about problems and study, and work efficiency has improved. For me, now I can play ball during my lunch break, sometimes take a walk after dinner, and when I return to the dormitory at night, I also have the mood to get a basin of water to wash my face and feet. More importantly, now my work is proactive and in-depth. I can plan to talk to people, and have enough time to regularly help one or two workshops or branches to summarize work and gain experience to promote the work of the entire factory.

    A Little Experience

    In this process of solving the problem of long amateur activity time and cadres holding multiple positions, I have deeply realized that: the key lies in the leadership having the determination, opening up the thinking of grassroots cadres, and cultivating and promoting a large number of cadres. In 1950, our factory also signed meeting contracts, and also announced that the masses could freely withdraw from the meeting if it was not adjourned by the time. In this way, the amateur activity time of some workers was also reduced. However, due to the lack of determination of the leadership at that time, the problem of cadres holding concurrent positions was not resolved, and cadres (including myself) took the lead in not complying with the system. This time, it was stipulated that amateur activity time for employees should be stopped after 10 p.m. The trade union chairman and individual Party branch secretaries were still secretly holding meetings after the stipulated time, but they changed the method and did not sit at the meeting table anymore. When questioned, they said, "Can't sleep, just bump heads casually." In response to this situation, we solved it from two aspects: one is to establish a diary system. Before 10 o'clock, each Party branch secretary must write down the work situation of the day and the work plan for tomorrow in a notebook and send it to the Party General Branch Committee. This day's work cannot but come to an end before 10 o'clock. The Party branch secretary has no spirit and no need to go to a meeting after 10 o'clock. One is to carry out criticism, persuasion, and education to them ideologically, pointing out that their enthusiasm for working day and night is good, but it is not enough to rely on enthusiasm to do revolutionary work. We must study and improve work methods and improve work efficiency. In order to cultivate cadres, we regularly and systematically explained the leadership methods of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao to the cadres, and advocated that everyone should discuss problems. On the one hand, ideological education was carried out, and on the other hand, specific assistance was given. The 44 political class tutors who were recently promoted from Party member workers were promoted in this way. If a political class is to be held on Tuesday, the Propaganda and Education Committee of the Party General Branch will first explain it to them on Monday, and they will have a bottom line in their hearts the next day.

    The reason why our factory can solve the problem of long amateur activity time and cadres holding multiple positions is fundamentally driven by the concern of the responsible comrades of the Central Committee and the leadership of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the CPC. Without these, everything would be impossible.

    石景山发电厂职工业余活动问题已合理解决
    编辑同志：石景山发电厂职工业余活动时间长，会议多，干部兼职多的情形，现在已经获得基本上的改进。这一改进，对于保护职工身体健康，提高生产效率，加强职工学习，改进工作方法等，起了极其良好的作用。
    一九五○年和一九五一年初，我们工厂职工业余活动时间过长，会议又多又乱，干部重叠兼职的情形相当严重。那时候，业余活动时间，一般工人是每周十六小时，干部和积极分子是二十小时左右。这就造成了职工过度疲劳，工作效率不高的后果。运转工人开会开得太多，睡眠不足，看机器时就打盹；有的人怕打盹挨批评，就以擦地板来刺激精神；有的人蹲在厕所就睡着了。会议多到这样的程度：一个党支部书记身兼七职，一个星期里在业余时间经常要开二十七个钟头的会议。党总支委员星期六经常开会开到夜里两点钟，星期天又继续开。
    形成这种情形的原因，客观方面是：当时政治运动多，任务重，几乎每天都有新的工作。再兼我厂几年来建立了很多新的机构，实行分场负责制，党、青年团、工会都按车间成立组织，各方面都需要干部。而我厂干部从老区来的不多，新提拔起来的干部，热情虽高，但缺少办法，领导干部便依靠开会来解决问题。另一方面，主观上是：当时对于如何节省会议时间尚无认识，更无经验。特别是，我是从农村来的，习惯于“白天上地，夜里开会”的农村工作方法。实际上这是不了解工人在生产过程中紧张劳动的情形，同时也是群众观点不强的反映。
    一九五一年，上级曾经批评我们这种开会过多的情形是“拼命主义”。而我们在实际工作中也日益深刻地感到这个问题的严重性。经过一年多来的努力，现在这个问题在我厂已经获得比较彻底的解决。我们是采取以下几种办法来解决的。
    反对单纯使用，放手提拔干部
    一、培养和提拔干部，解决干部兼职过多的问题。我们厂的很大数量的运转工人中，曾经只有一个共产党员。党要他作党的工作，青年团要他作团的支部书记，工会给他安上文教委员、歌咏队长、俱乐部干事、工会小组长等职务。谁也要抢好干部，谁也不愿意艰苦地培养干部。我们批评了这种“好使用的干部多使，不好的扔在一边”的单纯使用观点，大胆放手地提拔了一批干部。现在被提拔为科、股级以上的干部约占全厂工人总数的百分之七点五。过去，政治课辅导员都是党的支部委员兼任，现在改由党员工人担任。只要加强对他们的思想教育和具体帮助，他们是完全可以胜任的。新担任电气场车间工会劳保委员的王作明，在这次发窍门奖中，他深入到家属中去调查哪家缺花被单，哪家缺暖水瓶，然后按着各人的需要发奖，效果很好。事实证明：在旧社会最受欺压的工人，一旦有他们发挥才能的机会，他们都会以非常饱满的革命积极性来工作的。大量提拔干部以后，现在我们厂里车间主任以上的干部除了一个人以外，都不兼职了。车间主任以下，有六十六个干部兼一职，有六个人兼两职。兼职问题解决了，每周的党支部书记联席会议、车间工会主席联席会议、青年团支部书记联席会议，可以在一个时间分别召开。这样就有可能解决干部开会多的问题。
    统一分配业余活动时间
    二、减少一些不必要的会议，统一合理地分配业余活动时间。过去每一次布置生产计划时，一个党支部书记要参加六、七种内容相同的会议。如列席了党的总支委员会，参加工厂管理委员会和职工代表会，然后他就把这些计划和决定传达到支委会和支部大会，开完支部大会还要开车间群众大会，最后还要深入到小组会去听群众的反映。现在我们坚决改变这种做法，支部书记把总支的计划传达到车间以后，车间的会议便由车间工会主席去主持，支部书记和支部委员都不参加。过去发红旗奖的大会上，党、行政、工会、青年团都上台讲一套内容相同的话。劳动模范、技术人员再上去讲讲如何响应号召。各车间再来一个挑战竞赛，这样每次会议都要三小时半。工人说：“盼到你说散会，我拿腿就走”。这次全厂发奖金改变了方法，大会上发给车间，车间再发给个人，在工会活动时间内就发完了，并且培养和提高了车间干部的威信。现在每周党、行政、青年团、工会的业余活动时间，由党总支统一分配。什么时间开什么会，排定后公布出来，由群众监督执行。开会时宣布会议时间，到时开不完，群众可以自由退席。不在计划之内的会议，须经党总支批准才能开。
    合理地规定学习时间和内容
    三、精简了学习时间。第一个办法是：文化课由六小时减为四小时，技术课由三小时减为两小时。改变过去讲的多，没有时间复习，贪多嚼不烂的情况。第二个办法是：学了一样再学一样。初小程度的工人，分批学速成识字法，每周八小时，学完一批再轮换一批；高小的上业余学校；初中以上的分别上初、中级理论班或技术班；文化不高的干部上干部速成文化班。这样，文化课、理论班、干部文化班可以在同一个时间分别上课。改变了过去学这又学那，结果“鸡飞蛋也打”的情况。
    各系统领导干部集中住宿
    四、集中住宿。我们厂每一个生产单位的党支部书记、场主任、青年团支部书记、车间工会主席大部分集中住在一起。这间房子，便成为这个车间党员、团员和群众的活动中心。干部集中居住，可以随时商量问题，减少了开会讨论的时间，党总支又便于对他们进行教育。我们厂进步较快的干部如劳动模范刘德珍等便是第一批搬到厂里来集中住宿的。
    新的收获
    合理支配职工业余活动时间的结果，一般群众（占职工总数百分之五十点三）每周业余活动时间在八至十小时左右，积极分子（占职工总数百分之四十三点五）每周业余活动时间十至十二小时，党、团支部委员、车间工会委员、科长场主任等每周业余活动在十三至十四小时。全厂百分之九十三点八的职工，可以在晚上九点三十分休息，早上六点三十分才开始活动。这样的好处是：职工不再过度疲劳，情绪饱满，有足够的时间思考问题和学习，工作效率提高了。拿我来说，现在我中午休息时可以打打球，吃过晚饭也有时候散散步，夜里回到宿舍时也有心绪去打盆水洗脸洗脚。更重要的是，现在我的工作主动而深入了，可以有计划地找人谈话，有足够的时间经常帮助一两个车间或支部总结工作，取得经验以推动全厂的工作。
    一点体会
    在这次解决职工业余活动时间长、干部兼职多的问题中，我深刻地体会到：关键是在于领导要有决心，要打通基层干部的思想，要大量培养、提拔干部。一九五○年我们厂也曾订过会议合同，也曾宣布过到时不散会群众可以自由退席。这样，部分工人的业余活动时间也减少了一些。但由于当时领导决心不够，干部兼职问题没解决，干部（包括我自己）首先就带头不遵守制度。这次规定职工业余活动时间，宣布晚上十点钟以后停止一切活动，工会主席、个别的党支部书记，在过了规定时间还偷偷地开会，只是改变了方式，不坐在会议桌子上了。责问他们时他们说：“睡不着，随便碰碰头。”针对这一情况，我们从两方面来解决：一是建立写日记制度。十点钟以前，各个党支部书记都要把当天的工作情况和明天的工作计划写在本子上，送到党总支委员会。这一天的工作就不能不在十时以前告一结束。党支部书记就没有精神也没有必要再在十时以后去开会了。一是从思想上向他们进行批评、说服、教育，指出他们日以继夜地工作的热情是好的，但干革命工作凭热情硬干是不够的，必须研究改进工作方法，提高工作效率。为了培养干部，我们经常系统地向干部讲解党中央和毛主席的领导方法，提倡有问题大家商量。一方面进行思想教育，一方面给以具体帮助。最近从党员工人中提拔起来的四十四个政治课辅导员便是这样提拔起来的。星期二要上政治课，星期一便由党总支的宣教委员先向他们讲解，第二天他们心里就有了底。
    我们厂所以能够解决职工业余活动时间长和干部兼职多的问题，一个根本的动力是中央负责同志的关心和中共北京市委的领导。离开这些，一切都是不可能的。
