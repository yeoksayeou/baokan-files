"Soviet Woman" is a magazine jointly published by the Soviet Anti-Fascist Committee and the Central Committee of the Soviet Trade Unions. Its content and form are both very pleasing. It is like a pictorial because almost every article has beautiful illustrations; it is like a literary publication because most of the articles are vivid reports and creations; it is also like a political magazine because it contains strong political commentaries. This lively and serious comprehensive publication is warmly welcomed by readers in the Soviet Union and abroad. It is published in Russian, Chinese, English, French, German, Spanish, and other languages. The Chinese version has been published for exactly two years.

Humiliation and suffering are distant memories for Soviet women. They declare to the world: modern Soviet women do not understand what suffering is; only from the legends of the elderly and historical materials can they find the suffering of their grandmothers' generation. They clearly know how their happiness came about, and therefore know how to cherish and protect it. In the article "It is Very Happy to be a Soviet Citizen" in the second issue of "Soviet Woman" in 1952, it says: "Some people say that happy people seem to be unaware of their happiness. This is not true. Soviet people see and feel the happiness of their new life anytime, anywhere." Indeed, "Soviet Woman" faithfully and vividly reflects the "anytime, anywhere feeling" of Soviet women towards their happy life. From this magazine, we can not only see many enviable numbers that mark the rising levels of Soviet women's happy life, but more importantly, we can understand their excellent qualities and lofty ideals from the happy smiles and selfless labor of Soviet women. The protagonist of "A Scholar's Family" in the fourth issue of "Soviet Woman" in 1952, Lidia Ivanovna, who won the "Motherhood Glory" medal and a doctorate, said that she disagreed with what people used to say about it being difficult to be a woman. She enjoys the complete life of a woman, mother, and scholar. This article describes how she regularly arranges her life both spiritually and materially. Soviet women love their labor and creation. Their love is also built on common labor, mutual respect, and encouragement. The short story "Stefa, Wenzerk" in the second issue of 1952 is a wonderful example of reflecting this theme. It describes how a female bricklayer created advanced working methods through hard work and gained honor and pleasure. She originally loved her fiancé very much, but one day her fiancé said that he did not welcome her hands roughened by labor and wanted her to change her profession. She immediately told him that she had decided not to be with him anymore. She rebuked him: "So, my Yurek is such a person! At the conference, he hoped that more women would become bricklayers in New Huta, but when his fiancée wanted to be a bricklayer, he said: This is not a woman's job." It was not until Yurek expressed his remorse deeply that she agreed to restore her feelings with him.

"Soviet Woman" uses a large amount of space to reflect the Soviet government's meticulous care for children spiritually and materially, and correct educational methods. From this publication, you can see how concerned the Soviet Union is about the issue of children's toys. Grashuk, Deputy Minister of Education of the Russian Federation, who is also a member of the Children's Toy Art and Technology Committee, praised the many efforts made by the Soviet government and people to enable children to obtain beneficial toys in his article "Friend of Childhood". Here you can also see various clothing styles, which are also designed to cultivate aesthetic concepts. The novels and stories published in each issue, such as "Crystal Vase", "White Kimono", "French Lesson", "Father", "Brave Little Dog", and the interesting works in the "Children's Reading" column, are good readings and teaching materials that are difficult to find elsewhere.

"Soviet Woman" also reflects the achievements of the Soviet Union in science, construction, culture, and art, which are expressed in popular and concise language. For example, the article "Five Price Reductions" in the fourth issue of 1952 uses pictures to illustrate what they bought with the same salary during the previous price reductions; and what they bought more of during the fifth price reduction. The article "Attacking Death" tells us about a new invention in Soviet medicine - being able to revive people from death under certain conditions. The "Science and Life" column regularly introduces some fresh things in the Soviet scientific community, such as new signal lights, ice houses, etc.

All the happiness and peaceful construction of Soviet women are inseparable. "Soviet Woman" vividly presents their longing for peace and their will to fight for peace to us: she exposes the imperialist conspiracy to create war, accuses American imperialism of its crimes in Korea, and calls for stopping atrocities and rescuing mothers and children; she protests the arrest of German peace fighter Lily Wachter; she sends condolences to the mother of the Greek peace fighter sentenced to death; she publishes the resounding calls of the International Democratic Women's Federation and the International Children's Defense Committee; she publishes Comrade Deng Yingchao's "Heroic Women of China", Romanian female poet's "We are Going to the Light", Hungarian female writer's "Turned Over", and British peace fighter Mrs. Felton's "Truth Will Surely Triumph". "Soviet Woman" has shortened the geographical distance between women in various countries and linked their calls for peace.

Reading "Soviet Woman", we can gain many beneficial things. It is full of encouraging power. It has the highest scientific achievements of human labor, advanced experience in revolution and construction, female models who love labor and are full of creativity, happy families and new moral concepts that can be learned from, and good methods for educating children. She is a good teacher and friend of our women and all those who aspire to learn from the Soviet Union. (Manuscript from New China Women's Agency)

### “苏联妇女”是我们的良师益友

专栏：

    “苏联妇女”是我们的良师益友
    “苏联妇女”是苏联反法西斯委员会和苏联职工会中央委员会合办的杂志，她的内容和形式，都令人十分喜爱。她像画报，因为几乎每一篇文章，都有精美的插图；她像文艺刊物，因为大部分的文章，都是形象生动的报道和创作；她又像政治性杂志，因为她里面有强烈的政治评论。这个活泼而严肃的综合性刊物，受到苏联国内外读者的热烈欢迎。她用俄、中、英、法、德、西班牙等国文字出版，中文版发行以来恰好二年了。
    凌辱和痛苦，在苏联妇女说来，已是辽远的往事了。她们向全世界宣称：现代的苏联妇女不懂得什么是痛苦，只有从老年人的传说和历史材料中，才能找到祖母一代的苦难。她们清晰地知道她们的幸福是如何得来的，因而也就知道如何珍贵和卫护她。“苏联妇女”一九五二年第二期“当一个苏联女公民是很幸福的”一文中有这样的话：“有人说，幸福的人似乎觉察不出自己的幸福。这句话是不对的。苏联人随时随地都看见并感觉到自己新生活的幸福。”确实，“苏联妇女”是忠实而鲜明地反映了苏联妇女对于幸福生活的“随时随地的感觉”。我们从这个杂志里，不仅可以看到标示着苏联妇女幸福生活节节上升的令人羡慕的许多数目字，而更重要的是，我们可以从苏联妇女的幸福的微笑和忘我的劳动中了解到她们优良的品质和崇高的理想。“苏联妇女”一九五二年第四期“一个学者的家庭”的主人翁，获得“母性光荣”的奖章和博士学位的丽吉娅·伊万诺芙娜说：她不同意以前人们所说的当一个妇女是件难事的说法。她享受着一个女人、母亲和学者的三重幸福的圆满的生活，这篇文章就是叙述她自己如何在精神上和物质上都有规律地安排她的生活的方法。苏联妇女是热爱自己的劳动和创造的。她们的爱情也是建筑在共同劳动、互相尊重和鼓励的基础上。一九五二年第二期的短篇小说“斯特法、文泽克”就是反映这一主题的一个精彩的例子。这里是描述女泥水匠，她如何以辛勤的劳动创造了先进的工作方法，获得了荣誉和愉快。她本来很爱她的未婚夫，但有一天她的未婚夫说了一句对她的因劳动而磨粗的双手不表欢迎并要她转业的话，她就立刻告诉他，她决意不和他要好了。她责斥他：“原来，我的尤列克却是这样一个人！在大会上他希望新古塔有更多的妇女来当泥水匠，可是当他的未婚妻想当泥水匠时，他却开口说：这不是女人干的事情。”直到后来尤列克沉痛地表示悔改时，她才答应和他恢复感情。
    “苏联妇女”中用大量的篇幅反映了苏联政府对儿童在精神上和物质上无微不至的关怀，和正确的教育方法。从这份刊物里你可以看到苏联对于儿童玩具的问题是如何关心，俄罗斯联盟共和国教育部副部长格拉秀克，他兼了儿童玩具美术技艺委员会的委员，在他的“童年之友”一文里，盛赞苏联政府和人民为了使儿童获得有益的玩具所做的许多工作。这里还可以看到各种各样的服装式样，也是为了培养审美观念而设计的。分登在各期的小说和故事如“水晶花瓶”“白色的大和服”“法文课”“父亲”“勇敢的小狗”，和“儿童读物”栏的饶有趣味的作品，都是很难从其他地方找到的良好读物和教材。
    “苏联妇女”也反映了苏联科学、建设、文化、艺术各方面的成就，这些都是用通俗简炼的文字表达出来的。如一九五二年第四期“五次大减价”一文，就用图画说明她们以同样的工资，在历次物价减低时买到了些什么；第五次物价减低时，多买些什么。“向死亡进攻”一文告诉我们苏联医学上的新发明——在一定的条件下能使人死而复活。“科学与生活”栏经常介绍一些苏联科学界的新鲜事物，如新式信号灯，冰造屋等。
    苏联妇女的一切幸福与和平建设是分不开的。“苏联妇女”把她们对和平的热望和为和平而斗争的意志鲜明地呈现在我们的面前：她揭露帝国主义制造战争的阴谋，控诉美帝国主义在朝鲜的罪行，并呼吁制止暴行、援救母亲和儿童；她抗议德国和平女战士莉丽·瓦赫特的被捕；她慰问希腊被判死刑的和平战士的母亲；她刊出国际民主妇联和国际保卫儿童委员会的响亮的号召；她刊载我国邓颖超同志的“中国的英勇妇女”、罗马尼亚女诗人的“我们走向光明”、匈牙利女作家的“翻身了”、英国和平女战士费尔顿夫人的“真理必然胜利”。“苏联妇女”是这样地缩短了各国妇女在地理上的距离，把她们为和平斗争的呼声联系起来了。
    阅读“苏联妇女”，我们能获得许多有益的东西，那里充溢着令人欢欣鼓舞的力量，那里有人类劳动的最高的科学成品，有革命和建设的先进经验，有热爱劳动富于创造性的妇女模范，有可资学习的幸福家庭和新的道德观，有教育儿童的良好的方法。她是我们妇女和所有热望学习苏联者的良师益友。（新中国妇女社稿）
