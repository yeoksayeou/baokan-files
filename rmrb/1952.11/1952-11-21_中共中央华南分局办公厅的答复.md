Reply from the General Office of the CCP Central Committee South China Sub-Bureau
Regarding the opinions of the readers reported by the People's Daily concerning the Songzailing Incident in Enping County, Guangdong, we immediately contacted the CCP Yuexi District Party Committee and the Guangdong Provincial People's Court. Comrade Wu Zhongxi, Vice President (former President) of the Guangdong Provincial People's Court, conducted a self-criticism regarding this incident during the current judicial reform movement. At the same time, the Guangdong Provincial People's Court decided to use this incident as a typical case for a systematic review. Now, we provide the following explanation regarding the opinions raised by the readers: First, regarding Zheng Dingnuo, based on the reasons presented by the readers and the errors made by the offender in handling the case in Xiema Township, District 3 of Enping County, the CCP Yuexi District Party Committee suggested that the offender's sentence be changed to life imprisonment, which the Guangdong Provincial People's Court has agreed to. Second, Lin Xibo, a judge from the Yuezhong Branch of the Guangdong Provincial People's Court, has been detained for legal action; Xie Chuang, the concurrent President of the Branch, has been given a public warning within the Party. Third, Liang Bing, a public security officer of the People's Government of District 3 of Enping County (former puppet police, involved in gambling, trafficking in persons, and raping over a hundred women), has been sentenced to death and executed by shooting; Wu Chongjiong, Chief of the Investigation Section and Chief of the Execution Section of the Public Security Bureau of Enping County (former puppet military secret service chief, alias "Little Overlord," a corrupt element, who, together with the principal offender Feng Hanying, "interrogated" He Zhaoting and others, and arranged for inmates to abuse and brutally beat He Zhaoting and others to extract confessions), Wu Yueping, Warden of the Detention Center (who, together with the principal offender Feng Hanying, "interrogated" He Zhaoting and others, and directed inmates to abuse He Zhaoting and others), Zheng Chang, an interrogator (who used torture to extract confessions during the "interrogation" of He Zhaoting and others), and Wu Wanle, a clerk of the People's Court of Enping County (a former puppet court employee for over twenty years, who presided over the "interrogation" of He Zhaoting and others and used threats) and other bad elements have been detained for legal action. Fourth, the landlords and local tyrants who framed He Zhaoting and others: He Xinhe has been sentenced to death and executed by shooting; Feng Ruilin committed suicide by hanging himself in fear of punishment last May; Liang Zhiqiu has been sentenced to death with a two-year reprieve; Jin Shanwang has been sentenced to eight years of imprisonment; Liang Shannv (who had an affair with Feng Ruilin and was an accomplice in the murder) has been detained for legal action. Fifth, the families of the victims He Zhaoting, He Rong, Xu Zhong, and others have been given consolation rice, and monuments have been erected to commemorate the deceased.
