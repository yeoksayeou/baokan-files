A music worker said to me that before I heard the performances of the Soviet Art Troupe and the Soviet Army Alexandrov Red Banner Song and Dance Ensemble, I lacked an understanding of Soviet socialist music and art. Although I had read some of their musical theory texts translated into Chinese, sang some songs translated into Chinese, and listened to some of their records, it was not until I heard their performances this time that I truly gained a more comprehensive understanding of Soviet music, a real understanding of Comrade Stalin's brilliant theory of "socialist content, national form," and I became convinced that musical art can only achieve high development and brilliant achievements under the guidance of Marxism-Leninism.

This is not difficult to explain. The performances of the Soviet Art Troupe and the Red Banner Song and Dance Ensemble are both outstanding, with such clear and profound popular emotions and high artistic level, and the programs have many aspects. It is indeed a powerful and general description of the development direction of Soviet music culture and the artistic level achieved.

First of all, what should be mentioned naturally is the performance program. The music of each performance, the content of the program is very rich, and the selection of materials is extremely broad: there are modern Soviet creations, such as "Ode to Stalin," "We Defend Peace," "Singing Cotton-Picking Girls," "Victory," "Spring Garden Flowers are Beautiful"; there are Russian and other national folk songs, such as "Volga Boatmen's Song," "A Little White Birch in the Wilderness," "Indian Folk Song," "Lan Hua Hua"; there are classical instrumental pieces, such as "Slavic Dances," "Flight of the Bumblebee," "Prelude," as well as classical opera excerpts and solo songs. The modern Soviet creations strongly express the Soviet people's love of peace and their firm will to engage in socialist construction enthusiastically; although many other music originated in different eras and different nations, and are very far apart, this does not give the audience any mixed impression. On the contrary, the audience's impression is very clear and very unified. Because these works have the same content, they all express the lives of the people; the sources are the same, they all come from the people; therefore, each program can arouse strong resonance in the hearts of all listeners, and every listener feels that this is exactly the most powerful and most beautiful language they have been longing to hear, and it is also the language they have wanted to say for a long time.

In the performances of Mikhailov, Gaidai, Naserova, Pevtsov, Yemelyanova, Kogan and other singers and performers, it is particularly prominent that they all have a new performance style, that is, the socialist realism style in performance. All the singing and playing seem so bright, natural, easy, smooth, clear and easy to understand, as if no difficult techniques are needed; but experienced listeners know very well that all the programs require the performers to have a high degree of technical cultivation, but because in their performances, technology does not exist in isolation from the content, it is not easy to be felt. Precisely because of this, people can not be confused by the brilliance of external techniques, and can enter the depths of the soul of the work without hindrance with the performance, so all performances are full of irresistible internal appeal. Undoubtedly, this is because Soviet musicians have thoroughly overcome the vulgar tendency of showing off techniques in the performing arts in capitalist countries and established a new performance style.

In these performances by Soviet musicians, we especially see that Soviet music (creation and performance) has rich and strong national characteristics, which fully shows that the national form has never restricted the development of Soviet musical art, nor has it lowered the level of Soviet musical art. On the contrary, through the national form, the color of Soviet music is more distinct and richer. Due to the close combination of socialist content, such as the works sung by Pevtsov, Naserova, and Hanon, and the singing itself, the musical forms of various ethnic groups have been further developed, and socialist content has gained vivid expression and strong moving charm through national forms.

There are also many modern Chinese songs and folk songs in the programs performed by Soviet musicians. The performance of these songs not only shows their concern for the struggle life of the Chinese people and their deep understanding of the lives of the Chinese people, but also shows their love for the Chinese people; therefore, the performance of songs such as "The East is Red," "March of the Chinese People's Liberation Army," "February is Coming," and "Lan Hua Hua" has infinitely deep emotions, and therefore can give the greatest emotion.

The Soviet Art Delegation and the Red Banner Song and Dance Ensemble have achieved great achievements in their performances in China and have won the infinite love of the Chinese people. Their achievements will continue to expand with the increase in the number of performances, the love they receive from the Chinese people will continue to deepen, and the impact on Chinese music will continue to strengthen and become more significant. This has a great effect on the unity of the two peoples and has a significant significance for defending world peace.

We should strive to learn the popular character in Soviet music, learn the realistic tendency of Soviet musical art, and learn from their experience. Inherit and carry forward our national musical traditions, develop our own music, create more and better music, inspire the broad masses of the people to engage in the construction of the motherland, and strengthen the forces for defending world peace.

    学习苏联音乐的现实主义
    吕骥
    有一个音乐工作者对我说，在我还未听到苏联艺术工作团和苏军亚历山大罗夫红旗歌舞团的演出之前，对于苏联社会主义的音乐艺术，应该说，是缺乏理解的。过去虽然也看过他们的某些译成中文的音乐理论文字，也唱过一些被译成中文的歌曲，也听过他们的一些唱片，但直到我听了他们这次的演出之后，才真正使我对于苏联音乐具有更全面的理解，才使我对于斯大林同志的“社会主义内容、民族形式”的光辉学说具有真实的了解，才使我确信音乐艺术只有在马克思列宁主义指导下才能获得高度的发展和辉煌的成就。
    这是不难说明的，苏联艺术工作团和红旗歌舞团的演出都是非常杰出的，具有如此鲜明而深刻的人民情绪和高度的艺术水平，而节目又具有多方面的内容，确实是有力地概括地说明了苏联音乐文化的发展方向和在艺术上所达到的水平。
    首先要提到的，自然是演出的节目，每次演出的音乐，节目内容是十分丰富的，选材也是极其广阔的：有苏联现代的创作，如“斯大林颂”“我们保卫和平”“歌唱采棉的姑娘”“胜利”“春天的花园花儿好”；有俄罗斯及其他国家的民歌，如“伏尔加船夫曲”，“野地里一棵小白桦”“印度民歌”“蓝花花”；有古典器乐曲，如“斯拉夫民族舞曲”
    “野蜂飞舞”“前奏曲”，也有古典歌剧选曲和独唱曲。在苏联现代的创作中强烈地表现了苏联人民爱好和平，热情地从事社会主义建设的坚毅的意志；其它的许多音乐虽然产生于不同的年代和不同的民族，并且相距十分遥远，但并不因此使听众得到任何混杂的印象，相反地，听众的印象是十分鲜明，十分统一的。因为这些作品具有同一的内容，都是表现人民生活的；来源是相同的，都是来自人民；所以每个节目在所有听众心中能够引起强烈的共鸣，每个听众都感觉得这正是他们所渴望听到的最有力的最优美的语言，也正是他们心中久想说出的语言。
    在米哈伊诺夫、盖达伊、纳赛罗娃、裴布托夫、叶米里扬诺娃、柯冈及其他演唱者和演奏者的演出中异常突出地表现了他们一致地具有一种新的演出风格，那就是演出上的社会主义的现实主义风格。所有的演唱和演奏都显得那么明朗、自然、容易、流畅、清楚而易懂，仿佛都不需要艰难的技术似的；但有经验的听众很清楚地知道，所有的节目都要求演奏者具有高度的技术修养，不过因为在他们的演奏中技术不是离开内容孤立地存在，不容易被感觉到就是了。正因为如此，人们能够不被外在的技术的光芒所迷惑，能够无阻碍地随着演奏进入到作品的灵魂深处，因此所有的演奏都充满了不可抵抗的内在的感染力量。无疑地，这是由于苏联音乐家的彻底克服了存在于资本主义国家的演出艺术中的炫耀技术的庸俗倾向，建立了新的演出风格。
    在苏联音乐家的这些演出中特别使我们看到苏联音乐（创作和演出）都具有丰富的强烈的民族色彩，这就充分说明了民族形式丝毫不曾限制苏联音乐艺术的发展，也丝毫没有降低苏联音乐艺术的水平，相反地，通过民族形式，苏联音乐的色彩更加鲜明，更加丰富。由于密切地结合了社会主义内容，如裴布托夫、纳赛罗娃和哈侬所演唱的作品和演唱本身，使得各民族的音乐形式获得了更高的发展，社会主义内容通过民族形式获得了生动的表现和强烈感人的魅力。
    苏联音乐家演出的节目中也有很多中国现代歌曲和民歌。这些歌曲的演出不仅表现了他们对于中国人民斗争生活的关心，和他们对于中国人民生活的深刻的理解，同时也表现了他们对于中国人民的热爱；所以“东方红”“中国人民解放军进行曲”“二月里来”“蓝花花”等歌曲的演出具有无限深厚的情感，因此能够给人以最大的感动。
    苏联艺术代表团和红旗歌舞团在中国的演出已经获得伟大的成就，已经获得中国人民无限的热爱，他们的成就将随着演出的次数的增加日益扩大，受到中国人民的热爱也将日益加深，对于中国音乐的影响也将日益加强，日益显著，这对于两国人民的团结具有伟大的作用，对于保卫世界和平也具有重大的意义。
    我们应该努力学习苏联音乐中的人民性，学习苏联音乐艺术的现实主义倾向，学习他们的经验。继承并且发扬我们民族的音乐传统，发展我们自己的音乐，创造更多更好的音乐，鼓舞广大人民从事祖国的建设，加强保卫世界和平的力量。
