"Suffering Village" Transformed into "Joyful Village"
-- A Record of the Sanitation Work in Wu Lao Village, Nanjing

Wu Lao Village Used to be a "Suffering Village"

Wu Lao Village is a shantytown in Nanjing, with 214 households and 689 residents (90% of whom are working people). During the period of Japanese occupation, the area was full of stinking ditches (accounting for three-quarters of the village's land area). After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the Kuomintang reactionaries came and seized houses everywhere, squeezing many working residents into Wu Lao Village. With no other choice, people drove stakes into the stinking ditches and built thatched huts to live in. Whenever it rained, the stinking water flowed all over the house. At night, they had to put up door panels and spread straw to sleep on, and children slept in washbasins. On sunny days, the stench was unbearable, and many women suffered from headaches all year round. Because there were stinking ditches and sewage gullies everywhere, the roads were extremely difficult to travel. Vehicles often overturned on rainy days. The terrain here was low-lying, and sewage from all directions flowed into this area. Garbage from all over also gathered here. When the wind blew, the garbage flew everywhere.

Because the place was dirty, there were particularly many flies and mosquitoes, and adults and children often suffered from epidemics. In September 1945, those suffering from malaria and dysentery accounted for 80% of the village's population. Yu Cuihua's mother, No. 9 of the village, contracted malaria for three consecutive years after moving to Wu Lao Village. The residents repeatedly asked lawyers to write petitions to the puppet government and the puppet assembly, requesting the removal of the sewage in the village, but the response was indifference. The residents of Wu Lao Village were truly miserable. Therefore, people called Wu Lao Village "Suffering Village".

"Suffering Village" Becomes a Joyful Village

After liberation, the People's Government built sewers, repaired roads, installed electric lights, and established a tap water station here. During the Patriotic Health Campaign, the people of Wu Lao Village were excited. They used their own strength to overcome the disasters of nature and disease, and the appearance of the village took on a new look.

Now, as soon as people enter Wu Lao Village, they have a refreshing feeling. Here, you can no longer see stinking ditches and sewage puddles. The residents filled in more than 30 square zhang of water-filled depressions and paved 208 zhang of roads. A sewage ditch more than 70 zhang long no longer contains stinking water. The ditch is covered with fresh soil, and small bridges have been built on top of it. In public toilets, no flies were found this summer; there were also no maggots in the dung tanks. Near the public wells, no rotten vegetable leaves or dirty water can be seen. Every household is cleaned very carefully. Pig farmers have moved their pigsties to open spaces outside, and the sties are cleaned very well. People who drive tricycles and sell vegetables go out wearing clean clothes. The faces and hands of children and teenagers going to kindergartens and reading rooms are also clean.

The Patriotic Health Campaign has played a role in changing customs in the village. In the past, many families often didn't empty their chamber pots for two or three days. Now, all the chamber pots in the village are emptied twice a day on time. Ning Jianghua's family never washed dishes after meals in the past, but now they have completely changed this habit. The family of tricycle worker Xue Yu'an didn't pay attention to hygiene in the past, and their bodies were very dirty. Now, on "Patriotic Health Day," the whole family takes baths, changes clothes, and cuts their nails. The family of Chen Fengyun, who used to be known as a "dirty household," now regularly maintains the cleanliness and tidiness of their house, and even puts names on the drinking cups used by their four children so that they can use them separately. Not loving cleanliness has become an ugly thing in Wu Lao Village. Zhang Chen said: "In the past, under the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, we had no heart to talk about hygiene. Now, as soon as I open my eyes, I remember the broom and rag. If I don't do hygiene, I can't even eat." Some residents say, "Now, if I see something dirty and don't sweep it, I often feel uncomfortable and dissatisfied."

After the sanitation work was done well, the number of sick people decreased. Last summer, 26 people got sick, but this year only 5 people in the whole village got sick. Old Lady Kong of the village happily told people: "I didn't get sick this year because I paid attention to hygiene." Some old ladies said: "In the past, I dared not go out of the house. Now, the streets and alleys of the village are so clean that I can wear embroidered shoes to walk." Those who work and ride tricycles also say: "When hygiene is done well, we feel refreshed, and we are really energetic when we work." The name "Suffering Village" is already "outdated." People changed the name of Wu Lao Village to Joyful Village.

How Wu Lao Village's Sanitation Work Was Done Well

The reason why Wu Lao Village's sanitation work is done so well is not accidental.

At the beginning of the Patriotic Health Campaign, the work did not go very smoothly. When you wanted to kill flies and mosquitoes, some people said: "Flies and mosquitoes are sacred insects, how can they be killed?" When you wanted to sweep, some people said: "We have lived in stinking ditches for so many years, and now we want to talk about hygiene, isn't that just asking for trouble!" Some people even said: "If anyone wants to talk about hygiene, they should move to Taiping Road (the commercial district)." However, after in-depth publicity and education, coupled with the leading demonstration of activists, the situation completely changed. For example, Sha Suzhen was always someone who didn't wash dishes after eating and didn't see a doctor when she got sick. But after education, she actively participated in sanitation work and helped her neighbors sweep. After activist Xue Yu'an learned in the reading group that mosquitoes are the vector of malaria and encephalitis, he used a broken mosquito net to make a mosquito trap, and caught 50,000 mosquitoes in five days. Under his impetus, a mosquito-killing craze was set off in the whole village. Everyone organized a red flag competition and created a method of checking and scoring (a sanitation score sheet was posted at the door of each house, and a score was recorded for each inspection). Not only was there a competition between households, but family members also competed with each other.

After the movement deepened, the women became too busy. So the village opened a "kindergarten" for them, allowing women to free up time to learn hygiene knowledge and participate in reading groups and literacy classes, cultivating them as the backbone of sanitation work. The mothers responded: "This method is really good. Not only can children be educated, but adults also have time to talk about hygiene, which is really a win-win situation." Cha Changsheng's mother happily said: "In the past, with the children in tow, I couldn't concentrate on listening to the newspaper and doing hygiene. Now that the children are taken care of, I want to study hard and do a good job in sanitation work." On this basis, the village's sanitation work group organized 90% of the residents of the village and mobilized them to participate in sweeping, insect catching, pond filling, road repairing, inspection, and publicity. This has made the patriotic health campaign in the whole village persist.

The whole village has also formulated hygiene standards, requiring "three leveled and four not dirty" (three leveled: main roads leveled, alleys leveled, open spaces leveled. Four not dirty: ditches not dirty, courtyards not dirty, toilets not dirty, roads not dirty") and "five clean and six neat" (five clean: roof clean, floor clean, walls clean, doors and windows clean, corners clean. Six neat: body and diet neat, clothes and bedding neat, chests and cabinets neat, tables and chairs neat, pots, bowls, ladles, and spoons neat, jars, vats, and urns neat). These two slogans have become the guiding principles for the actions of the residents of the whole village. Everyone does according to these slogans, and the inspection team also inspects according to these slogans. The sanitation campaign in the whole village has therefore become more in-depth.

The sanitation work in Wu Lao Village is now completely regularized. Every day before 9:00 a.m., flies and mice are collected and handed over, and chamber pots are emptied twice, once after 8:00 a.m. and once after 4:00 p.m. In the morning, the residents' mutual aid groups clean the "contracted" areas, and in the afternoon, the inspection team of the Democratic Women's Federation conducts inspections; a "Patriotic Health Day" is held once a week, and a joint meeting of activists is held once a week. As for hygiene publicity and education, it has also become a regular task of reading groups and literacy classes.

The sanitation work in Wu Lao Village has become a banner for sanitation work in Nanjing. During the Patriotic Health Campaign, 50 units and nearly 2,000 people visited Wu Lao Village's sanitation work. They were all deeply educated during the visit, and they expressed their willingness to learn from Wu Lao Village and praised Wu Lao Village as a "red flag that never falls."

    “苦恼村”变成了“欢乐村”
    ——记南京市五老村的卫生工作
    吕健军
    五老村过去是个“苦恼村”
    五老村是南京的一个棚户区，居民有二百一十四户，六百八十九人（其中百分之九十是劳动人民）。在日寇统治时期，这里到处是臭水坑（占全村土地面积的四分之三）。抗日战争胜利后，国民党反动派来了，他们到处抢占房子，把许多劳动居民挤到了五老村。大家没有办法，只好在臭水坑里打下桩，盖起草棚子住下。每逢阴雨天，臭水满屋子流，晚上只好搭起门板，铺上稻草睡觉，小孩就睡在脚盆里。遇到晴天，臭气薰人，许多妇女一年四季害头疼病。因为到处都是臭水坑、污水沟，道路真是难走极了，下雨天经常发生翻车的事情。这里地势低洼，四面八方的污水都向此地流；各处的垃圾也向这里集中，大风一起，垃圾到处飞滚。
    因为地方脏，苍蝇蚊子就特别多，大人小孩经常害流行病。一九四五年九月，得疟疾、痢疾的占全村人口的百分之八十。村上九号余翠华的妈搬到五老村以后，一连打了三年的“摆子”。居民曾三番五次地请律师写呈文给伪政府、伪参议会，要求清除村里的污水，但得到的回答是置之不理。五老村的居民，真是苦恼极了。于是人们就把五老村称做
    “苦恼村”。
    “苦恼村”成了欢乐村
    解放后，人民政府在这里修建了下水道，修了马路，装置了电灯，设立了自来水站。爱国卫生运动中，五老村的人们沸腾起来了，他们用自己的力量，战胜了自然和疾病的灾害，使村子的面貌焕然一新。
    现在，人们一走进五老村，就有一种清新的感觉。在这里，再也看不到臭水坑和污水洼了。居民们填了三十多平方丈的水坑洼地，铺平了二百零八丈的道路。一条长达七十多丈的污水沟，现在里面已经没有臭水了，沟里都铺上了新土，上面还搭了一座座的小桥。公用厕所，今年夏天没有发现苍蝇；粪缸里也没有蛆。公用的水井附近，看不到腐烂的菜叶和脏水。家家户户，都打扫得很干净。养猪户都把猪栏挪到室外空地上，栏里打扫得很清洁。踏三轮车的、卖菜的，都穿着干净的衣裳出门。到幼儿园、阅览室去的儿童少年，脸孔和两手也都是干干净净的。
    爱国卫生运动在村上起了移风易俗的作用。过去，很多人家常常两三天不倒一次马桶，现在全村马桶都按时一天倒两次。宁将华家，过去吃了饭从不洗碗，现在则完全改变了这种习惯。三轮车工人薛玉安家，过去一家人都不注意卫生，身上弄得很脏，现在逢到“爱国卫生日”，全家人都洗澡换衣、剪指甲。过去有名的“肮脏户”陈凤云家，现在经常保持室内的清洁整齐，四个小孩用的茶杯上都给贴上名字，让孩子们分开用。不爱清洁，在五老村已经变成一件丑事。张陈氏说：“过去在国民党反动派统治下那有心思讲卫生。现在呀，一睁开眼睛就记得扫帚、抹布，不搞卫生，连饭都吃不下。”有的居民说“现在见了脏东西不扫，往往感到不顺眼、不称心”。
    卫生工作搞好以后，生病的人减少了。去年夏天，有二十六个人生病，今年全村生病的只有五个人。村上孔老太太高兴地向人说：“我今年没生病，就是因为讲了卫生。”有的老太太说：“过去蹲在屋子里不敢出门，现在村上的大街小巷都是那么干净，可以穿上绣花鞋走路了。”做工的、蹬三轮车的也都说：卫生搞好了，精神就爽快了，做起事来真有劲。“苦恼村”的名字已经“过时”了。人们便把五老村改称为欢乐村。
    五老村的卫生工作是怎样做好的
    五老村的卫生工作，所以做得这样好，并不是偶然的。
    爱国卫生运动开始的时候，工作是进行得不很顺利的，你要打苍蝇蚊子，有人就说：“苍蝇、蚊子都是神虫，怎能打尽。”你要进行打扫，有人就说：“在臭水坑里活了这么多年了，现在要讲卫生，那不是自找麻烦吗！”甚至有人说：“谁要讲卫生，搬到太平路（商业区）去住好了。”但是，经过了深入的宣传教育，加上积极分子的带头示范，情况就完全改变了。例如，沙素珍向来是个吃饭不洗碗、生病不找医生的人，但经过教育，她积极参加了卫生工作，并帮助邻居打扫。积极分子薛玉安在读报组里学习以后，知道蚊子是传染疟疾、大脑炎的媒介，他就用破帐子做了一个捕蚊网，五天就捕了五万只蚊子。在他的带动下，全村掀起了捕蚊热潮，大家组织了红旗竞赛，创造了检查记分的办法（每家门口给贴上一张卫生记分表，每检查一次就记一次分）。不仅户和户之间进行了竞赛，家里人也互相进行竞赛。
    运动深入以后，妇女们就忙不过来了。于是村上给她们开办了一个“幼儿园”，让妇女腾出时间学习卫生知识，参加读报组、识字班，把她们培养为卫生工作的骨干力量。母亲们反应：“这个办法真好，不光小孩能受到教育，大人也有时间讲卫生，真是一举两得。”查长胜的妈妈高兴地说：“过去小孩拖在身边，听读报、搞卫生，老不定心。现在小孩有人照管了，我要好好学习，搞好卫生工作。”在这个基础上，村里的卫生工作组，便把全村百分之九十的居民组织起来，发动他们参加了打扫、捕虫、填塘、修路、检查、宣传等项工作。这样就使全村的爱国卫生运动坚持下来了。
    全村还订立了卫生标准，要求做到“三平四不脏”（三平：大路平，小巷平，空地平。四不脏：沟不脏，院不脏，厕所不脏，路不脏”）和“五清六净”（五清：屋顶清洁，地面清洁，墙壁清洁，门窗清洁，角落清洁。六净：身体饮食干净，衣服被褥干净，箱笼橱柜干净，桌椅板凳干净，锅碗、瓢、勺干净，缸坛瓮罐干净。）这两句口号成为全村居民的行动指针，大家都照着这口号做，检查组也照着这个口号检查。全村的卫生运动因此就更趋深入了。
    五老村的卫生工作，现在完全做到经常化了。每天上午九时以前，收交苍蝇老鼠，上午八时后和下午四时后各倒一次马桶。早上，居民互助组把“包干”地区打扫干净，下午由民主妇女联合会的检查小组进行检查；每星期过一次“爱国卫生日”，开一次积极分子联席会。至于卫生宣传教育，也已成为读报组、识字班的经常工作了。
    五老村的卫生工作已成为南京市卫生工作的一面旗帜。在爱国卫生运动中，曾有五十个单位、近两千人去参观过五老村的卫生工作。他们在参观中都受到了深刻的教育，纷纷表示要向五老村学习，并且赞美五老村是个“红旗不落村”。
