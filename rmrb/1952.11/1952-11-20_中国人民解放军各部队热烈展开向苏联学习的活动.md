Xinhua News Agency, 19th: The Chinese People's Liberation Army units have enthusiastically launched activities to learn from the Soviet Union during the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month." From cities to villages, from army barracks to naval vessels, from air force airfields to anti-aircraft artillery positions guarding the motherland's airspace, everywhere is filled with a warm, intense, and joyous atmosphere.

At the beginning of "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month," all units held celebration meetings and evening parties. At the meetings, unit leaders reported on the history of Sino-Soviet friendship and the importance of learning from the Soviet Union. A military school in a certain military region of Northeast China also held a military parade to summarize the achievements and experience in learning from the advanced military science of the Soviet army. Troops guarding the motherland's coastal defense on the east coast also conducted celebration activities in units of battalions and companies. Troops stationed on the Tibetan Plateau—Lhasa and Ganzi—held joint celebrations with the local Tibetan people.

All units have launched publicity activities for Sino-Soviet friendship. The film projection team organized by the North China Military Region brought the latest Soviet films to the companies for screening. The nine film projection teams of the Northwest Military Region have been dispatched to the garrisons in various remote areas. The film projection team of the East China Military Region has penetrated deep into the coastal defense front for screenings. After watching the films, the soldiers held discussions, determined to learn from the heroes in the Soviet military films, and to practice their skills to defend the motherland's defense. All units also held Soviet photo exhibitions. The Political Department of the Shandong Military Region held a touring exhibition of eleven Soviet pictures, exhibiting the great achievements of the Soviet army. The photo exhibitions in Guizhou, Hubei and other military regions also introduced the exemplary deeds of the heroes in the Soviet army. These pictures were of great educational significance to the soldiers. The fifty-four wired broadcasting stations of the Central South Military Region units have added special programs on "Sino-Soviet Friendship" to explain the advanced Soviet military science and technology and to introduce the great spirit of patriotism and internationalism of the Soviet army. Many company wall newspapers and blackboard newspapers have published special issues for "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month," and tens of thousands of soldiers have written articles expressing their deep feelings of love for the Soviet Union and learning from the Soviet Union. Combat heroes from various units who have returned from visits to the Soviet Union are giving reports to the soldiers on their visits. Jiang Xueshan, the commander of the Tasha Hero Regiment, a nationally renowned combat hero, and Guo Junqing, a female combat hero, have given more than thirty reports on their visits to the Soviet Union to the local garrisons in Guangzhou, which have been warmly welcomed by the soldiers.

During the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month," a wave of learning has been universally set off in all units. The study movement of cadres and soldiers in the Southwest Military Region has fully begun on November 10th. Cadres are studying the documents of the 19th Congress of the Communist Party (Bolsheviks) of the Soviet Union; the soldiers of each company are taking the Communist Party and Communism as the content of their study, with a fixed time for classes and discussions every Saturday. All the cadres of the East China and Northwest Military Regions have begun to study the documents of the 19th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks), and cadres above the battalion level in the North China and Northeast Military Regions are also studying these documents. The East China Naval Force has also held four consecutive report meetings to introduce the achievements of the Soviet Union in various aspects of construction and the glorious examples of maritime combat. Since the 7th of this month, the companies of the North China Military Region have been using half a day every day to study the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Teaching Materials for Troops" compiled by the Political Department of the Military Region. Many units in the East China Military Region have launched a movement to read a book introducing the Soviet Union, and books about the Soviet Union's production and construction and the Soviet army are in short supply in the troops. "Ordinary Soldier" and "Day and Night" have become the favorite reading materials of cadres and soldiers.

Through the activities of the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month," the cadres and soldiers of all units have further realized that the Soviet army is their model. From the images of the Soviet heroes, they have deeply understood the noble qualities, excellent military technology, and high degree of organization and discipline of the Soviet army. Many companies have written letters to the Soviet army, expressing their desire and determination to learn from the Soviet Union. The commanders and combatants of the "Dagushan Company," a heroic company that won a major victory in defending Dagushan in Luzhongnan during the Liberation War, jointly wrote a letter to the Soviet army, saying: "We must learn from you—the big brothers—the high degree of patriotism and internationalism in defending the motherland and defending peace during the Great Patriotic War. We must always make unremitting efforts to learn technology and culture well, so as to further master modern technical equipment and combat art, to defend the motherland and world lasting peace."

    中国人民解放军各部队热烈展开向苏联学习的活动
    【新华社十九日讯】中国人民解放军各部队在“中苏友好月”中热烈展开了向苏联学习的活动。从城市到乡村，从陆军的营房到海上的舰艇，从空军的机场到警卫着祖国领空的高射炮阵地，到处充满了热烈、紧张、欢欣的气氛。
    “中苏友好月”开始时，各部队都举行了庆祝会和晚会，会上部队首长报告了中苏友好的历史和向苏联学习的重要性。东北军区某军事学校还举行阅兵典礼，总结了学习苏联军队先进军事科学的成就和经验。在东海岸上警卫着祖国海防的部队，也分别以营、连为单位进行了庆祝活动。驻在西藏高原——拉萨和甘孜的部队，都和当地藏族人民举行了联欢。
    各部队都展开了中苏友好的宣传活动。华北军区组织的电影放映队，携带最新的苏联影片到各连队放映。西北军区的九个电影放映队已分赴各边远地区的驻军中进行活动。华东军区电影放映队已深入海防前线放映。战士在看了电影以后，都进行了讨论，决心向苏联军事影片中的英雄们学习，为捍卫祖国的国防，练好本领。各部队还举办了苏联图片展览会。山东军区政治部举办了十一个苏联图片的巡回展览，展出有关苏联军队的伟大战绩。贵州、湖北等军区的图片展览也都介绍了苏联军队中英雄们的模范事迹，这些图片对于战士们有很大的教育意义。中南军区各部队的五十四个有线广播台都增加了“中苏友好”特别节目，讲解苏联的先进军事科学和技术，介绍苏联军队的爱国主义和国际主义的伟大精神。许多连队的墙报和黑板报都出版了“中苏友好月”特刊，成千成万的战士都写了文章，表达他们热爱苏联、学习苏联的深厚感情。由苏联访问归来的各部队的战斗英雄，正在向战士们作访苏报告。全国著名的战斗英雄——塔山英雄团团长江雪山和女战斗英雄郭俊卿，在广州已向当地驻军作了三十多次访苏报告，受到战士们的热烈欢迎。
    在“中苏友好月”中，各部队普遍掀起了学习热潮。西南军区干部、战士的学习运动已在十一月十日全面开始，干部学习苏联共产党（布）第十九次代表大会的文件；各连队战士以共产党和共产主义为学习内容，在每星期六规定一定时间上课和讨论。华东、西北军区的全军干部已开始学习联共（布）第十九次代表大会的文件，华北、东北军区的营级以上干部也在学习这些文件。华东海军部队并已连续举行了四个报告会，介绍苏联各方面的建设成就和光辉的海上战斗范例。华北军区各连队自本月七日起，每天以半天时间学习军区政治部编的“部队中苏友好教材”。华东军区许多单位展开了阅读一本介绍苏联的书籍的运动，有关介绍苏联的生产建设和苏联军队的书籍在部队中已供不应求。“普通一兵”、“日日夜夜”已成为干部和战士最爱好的读本。
    各部队的干部和战士们，通过“中苏友好月”的活动，更进一步地认识到苏联军队是自己的榜样。从苏联英雄们的形象中，他们深深地了解了苏联军队的高尚品质、优秀的军事技术、高度的组织性与纪律性。很多连队写信给苏联军队，表示了向苏联学习的愿望和决心。在解放战争中曾因坚守鲁中南岱崮山而获得重大胜利的“岱崮连”英雄连队的全体指挥员、战斗员，联名写信给苏联军队，信上说：“我们一定要学习你们——老大哥们在卫国战争中保卫祖国、保卫和平的高度爱国主义和国际主义的精神，我们一定永远不懈地尽一切努力学好技术和文化，以进一步掌握现代化的技术装备和作战艺术，来保卫祖国和世界持久和平。”
