Several Issues on Consolidating and Improving the Patriotic Labor Competition in State-Owned Trading Departments in East China
Zhang Yufan, Deputy Director of the Trade Department of the East China Military and Administrative Committee

The patriotic labor competition movement in the state-owned trading system of East China began with typical experiments in the regional-level companies in early July. By August and September, branches in various provinces (regions) and cities had fully unfolded the movement and penetrated into grassroots units. The competition movement improved the operation and management of enterprises, enhanced the work efficiency of various departments, strengthened the policy awareness of staff, and closely connected superior and subordinate relationships. In short, its achievements are significant. We must resolutely implement this movement and constantly consolidate and improve it, making it a regular leadership method for state-owned trading departments, relying on it to complete this year's planned tasks and laying a good foundation for the future implementation of the economic accounting system. To implement this movement, based on the experience of the movement, the following issues must be resolved:

I. It is necessary to enhance the understanding of labor competition among cadres (especially leading cadres).

The labor competition movement in the state-owned trading system of East China was launched on the basis of the "Three-Anti" movement. After the "Three-Anti" movement, cadres began to recognize the harm of capitalist management ideas to the people's cause and established the idea that socialist management methods must be implemented to make trade work serve production and serve the people. The labor competition movement unified this new understanding with practical actions.

At the beginning of the labor competition movement, many cadres and the masses doubted whether the "competition" could be launched, and even did not know why the labor competition should be carried out. The achievements of the movement have improved the understanding of these people and broken their doubts. Now everyone's common conclusion is that the state-owned trading system can not only compete, but must compete. However, this understanding is not completely consolidated and must be raised further to continuously improve and implement the labor competition movement.

It must be made clear to everyone that the purpose of our labor competition now is to truly operate our state-owned trading enterprises in accordance with socialist management methods. And the most important part of implementing socialist management is to implement the economic accounting system. Therefore, we must resolutely overcome capitalist management ideas and supply system ideas through the competition movement. In the "Three-Anti" movement and the competition movement, we have strictly criticized capitalist management ideas, and its position has been shrinking. Of course, we must continue to fight against capitalist ideas and never slacken our efforts.

Currently, the more dangerous idea in the state-owned trading system is the supply system idea. Its main manifestations are: not knowing the family assets, having no idea what is going on; not planning carefully, accumulating waste; not valuing systems, adopting guerrilla habits; government buying and selling, bureaucratic style. The supply system idea is particularly dangerous mainly because we have ignored it in the past, and therefore its harm is particularly serious in the construction of our state-owned trading enterprises. For example, the leading cadres of the China Silk Company have serious supply system ideas, blindly carrying out production, so that many products are not up to specifications, on the one hand, they cannot fulfill the contract and supply qualified products, on the other hand, they accumulate a large number of unqualified products, causing serious economic and political losses. This shows that without overcoming the supply system idea, the economic accounting system cannot be realized, and the labor competition movement cannot be deeply implemented.

II. It is necessary to carry out the rationalization proposal movement with leadership, planning, and organization.

After the masses are mobilized, it is correct to put forward the slogan "Everyone uses their brains, there are tricks everywhere, suggestions are not big or small, as long as they are useful". Its main purpose is to encourage the masses to bravely use their brains and break the mystery concept of rationalization proposals. In July, employees of state-owned trading enterprises at the East China level put forward 3,138 rationalization proposals of various sizes, many of which had significant savings value. We promptly rewarded and commended these rationalization proposals. By August, 10,031 rationalization proposals had appeared in the East China-level companies. However, some deviations also occurred in this movement, mainly focusing on quantity rather than quality, so that the rationalization proposals produced a phenomenon of crude manufacturing. Later, the leadership put forward the slogans "Propose topics and write articles", "Create quotas" and "Systematic operation methods", and emphasized "Equal emphasis on quality and quantity". This movement immediately showed a new atmosphere. The gear operation method of the purchasing, allocation and transportation system of department stores was created. In order to develop rationalization proposals with leadership, planning, and organization, we proposed to carry out professional competitions within various systems from top to bottom, and adopt the method of holding meetings of advanced workers in rationalization on a system basis. For example, the Secretariat convenes meetings of advanced workers in rationalization in various professions such as typists, confidential personnel, document archives, and life management, and systematically organizes the rationalization proposals in various aspects, and sets a complete set of scientific advanced operating systems, and stipulates the advanced average standard as the quota that everyone must complete. The most advanced work records should become the goal of everyone's efforts. Only in this way can the rationalization proposals be more effectively closely integrated with the system construction work, and the labor competition movement can be further deepened and improved.

III. It is necessary to strengthen the leadership of Party and government leading organs over the trade departments.

Without the leadership and strong support of the East China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and the East China Military and Administrative Committee, the labor competition in the state-owned trading departments of East China could not be carried out, and even if it could be carried out, it could not be consolidated. In the "Three-Anti" movement, the newly established Party Committee of the East China Military and Administrative Committee Trade Department unified the leadership of the Party organizations of the enterprises directly under the East China Trade Department, overcoming the shortcomings of inconsistent steps of the Party, the administration, the trade union, and the Communist Youth League in the past. At the same time, the East China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee also transferred more than 100 Party affairs cadres to work in the enterprises directly under the East China Trade Department, which greatly strengthened the strength of the trade departments and enabled the labor competition of the trade departments to be launched smoothly. At the award ceremony held by the East China Trade Department, the personal instructions of Comrade Tan Zhenlin, Third Secretary of the East China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, and Vice Chairman Zeng Shan of the East China Military and Administrative Committee, and the convening of the joint meeting of the five departments of trade, cooperation, transportation, banking, and taxation in East China, and the launch of labor competitions in these five departments, made all employees of the East China Trade Department further realize the importance of labor competition, and further encouraged all employees' confidence in winning the labor competition.

Similarly, without strengthening the leadership of Party committees and governments at all levels over the trade departments, the universal development and lasting consolidation of labor competition is also impossible. The trade departments of Anhui Province have won the honorary title of the East China region twice in a row, which is inseparable from the attention paid by the Party and government leading organs of Anhui Province to the labor competition movement of the trade departments. The secretaries of the CPC prefectural committees, commissioners of the special zones, secretaries of the CPC county committees and county heads in various parts of Anhui mostly served as the directors and deputy directors of the competition committees, personally grasping the labor competition movement and material exchange work of the trade departments, making the trade work in Anhui leap forward. Facts have proved that whether the labor competition in the state-owned trading system can be persistently and firmly implemented, the strengthening of leadership by the Party and government leading organs is a decisive factor.

    巩固和提高华东区国营贸易部门爱国主义劳动竞赛的几个问题
    华东军政委员会贸易部副部长  张雨帆
    华东区国营贸易系统的爱国主义劳动竞赛运动，在七月初由区级各公司开始进行典型试验，到八、九月份，各省（区）市分支机构先后全面展开，并已深入到基层单位。竞赛运动改善了企业的经营管理，提高了各部门的工作效率，加强了工作人员的政策观念，密切了上下级关系，总之，它的成绩是很显著的。我们要把这个运动坚决地贯彻下去，并且不断地加以巩固和提高，使它成为国营贸易部门经常的领导方法，依靠它完成今年的计划任务，并为今后实施经济核算制打下良好的基础。为了把这个运动贯彻下去，根据运动开展的经验，必须解决下列几个问题：
    一、必须提高干部（尤其是领导干部）对劳动竞赛的认识。
    华东区国营贸易系统的劳动竞赛，是在“三反”运动的基础上开展起来的。经过“三反”运动，干部开始认识了资本主义的经营思想对人民事业的危害性，树立了必须实行社会主义的经营管理方法，使贸易工作为生产服务、为人民服务的思想。劳动竞赛使这种新的认识和实际行动统一起来了。
    在劳动竞赛运动开展之初，许多干部、群众曾经怀疑能不能“赛”起来，甚至还不知道为什么要开展劳动竞赛。运动开展以来的成绩，提高了这些人的认识，打破了他们的疑虑。现在大家共同的结论是国营贸易系统不但可以竞赛，而且必须竞赛了。但是，这种认识还不是完全巩固的，必须再提高一步，才能使劳动竞赛运动不断提高和贯彻下去。
    必须使大家明确认识，我们现在进行劳动竞赛的目的，就是要真正依照社会主义的经营方法，来经营我们的国营贸易企业。而实行社会主义经营管理最主要的一环，是实行经济核算制。因此，我们必须坚决地通过竞赛运动，克服资本主义经营思想和供给制思想。在“三反”运动和竞赛运动中，我们对资本主义经营思想进行了严格的批判，它的阵地已日益缩小，当然，我们必须再接再厉地进行反对资本主义思想的斗争，绝不能麻痹松劲。
    目前在国营贸易系统中更危险的思想是供给制思想。其主要表现是：不摸家底，心中无数；不打算盘，积压浪费；不重制度，游击习气；衙门买卖，机关作风。供给制思想之所以特别危险，主要是因为我们过去把它忽视了，因而在我们国营贸易企业的建设当中，其危害性就表现得特别严重。例如中国蚕丝公司领导干部存在着严重的供给制思想，盲目地进行生产，以致许多产品不合规格，一方面不能履行合同，供应合格的产品，另方面又积压了大量积压的不合格的产品，造成经济上政治上的严重损失。这就说明，不克服供给制思想，就不能实现经济核算制，劳动竞赛运动也就不能深入贯彻下去。
    二、必须有领导有计划有组织地开展合理化建议运动。
    当群众发动起来之后，提出“人人动脑筋，处处有窍门，建议无大小，只要有作用”的号召是正确的，其目的主要在于鼓舞群众勇敢地开动脑筋，打破对合理化建议的神秘观念。七月份华东区一级的国营贸易企业的职工提出大小合理化建议三千一百三十八件，其中许多是有重大的节约价值的建议。我们及时奖励、表扬了这些合理化建议，到八月份，华东区一级公司又出现了一万零三十一件合理化建议。但是，在这个运动中也产生了某些偏向，主要是只重视数量，不重视质量，因此使合理化建议产生了粗制滥造的现象。以后，领导方面提出“出题目做文章”、“创造定额”和“系统作业方法”的号召，并强调“质量并重”，这个运动立即出现了新气象，百货公司关于采购调拨运输系统的轮齿作业法就被创造出来了。为使合理化建议有领导、有计划、有组织地开展起来，我们提出了由上而下开展各系统内部的专业竞赛，采取按系统召开合理化先进工作者会议的办法。例如，秘书处召集打字员、机要、文书档案、生活管理等各专业的合理化先进工作者会议，把各方面的合理化建议系统地组织起来，订出一套完整的科学的先进作业制度，并将先进平均标准规定为每人必须完成的定额，其最先进的工作纪录，应成为大家努力奋斗的目标。只有这样，才能使合理化建议更有效的同系统建设工作密切结合起来，使劳动竞赛运动更深入提高一步。
    三、必须加强党政领导机关对贸易部门的领导。
    没有中共中央华东局及华东军政委员会的领导与有力的支持，华东区国营贸易部门的劳动竞赛就搞不起来，即使搞起来也不能巩固下去。“三反”运动中，新建立的中共华东军政委员会贸易部党委会统一了华东贸易部直属各企业党组织的领导，克服了过去党、行政、工会、青年团的步调不一致的缺点。同时，中共中央华东局并抽调出一百多个党务干部，分配到华东贸易部直属各企业工作，这就大大加强了贸易部门的力量，使贸易部门的劳动竞赛顺利发动起来。在华东贸易部举行的授奖大会上，中共中央华东局第三书记谭震林同志和华东军政委员会曾山副主席的亲临指示，和华东区贸易、合作、交通、银行、税收等五个部门的联席会议的召开，以及这五个部门劳动竞赛的开展，使华东贸易部门的全体职工进一步认识了劳动竞赛的重要性，更加鼓舞了全体职工争取劳动竞赛胜利的信心。
    同样，没有各级党委和政府加强对贸易部门的领导，劳动竞赛的普遍开展和持久巩固也是不可能的。安徽省贸易部门连续两次取得华东全区的优胜荣誉，这和安徽省党政领导机关重视贸易部门的劳动竞赛运动是分不开的。安徽各地的中共地委书记、各专区的专员、各县的中共县委书记和县长，大都担任了竞赛委员会的正副主任，亲自掌握贸易部门的劳动竞赛运动和物资交流工作，使安徽的贸易工作突飞猛进。事实证明，国营贸易系统的劳动竞赛能否持久、巩固地贯彻下去，党政领导机关的加强领导是决定的因素。
