Achievements of the Northeast State-Owned Trade System Since the Establishment of Wholesale Stations
By our special correspondent Chen Xin

I. The Process of Establishing Wholesale Stations

The commercial network of Northeast state-owned trade was gradually organized with the establishment of local people's governments in Northeast China. The organization of commodity circulation in the entire region was also carried out from top to bottom according to the administrative system (province, county, city). This approach played a significant role during the economic recovery and reconstruction period in controlling the market, stabilizing prices, and supporting industrial production and meeting the needs of people's lives in a focused manner. However, with the commencement of large-scale economic construction and the continuous increase in people's purchasing power, this approach could no longer meet the objective needs. This is because this approach resulted in too many levels of commodity allocation, pricing, and capital utilization. Coupled with inaccurate distribution and supply plans and a lack of coordination in organizational work, procedures, and systems, the state-owned trade plan might become divorced from the market, failing to exert the leadership role it should play for cooperatives and private merchants.

In order to change this situation, the Northeast Trade Department learned from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union in establishing industrial products wholesale stations according to the principle of economic zoning. In July 1951, based on the principle of economic zoning within the Northeast region, fifteen wholesale stations for cotton yarn and fabrics and general merchandise were successively established in Shenyang, Lushun-Dalian, Changchun, Harbin, and other places. (In order to further promote the integration of production and sales and implement economic accounting, the Northeast Trade Department is currently following the spirit of the Central Ministry of Commerce's decision on establishing wholesale stations, reorganizing wholesale stations based on the rational division of labor between wholesale and retail and the principle of refining commodities, and beginning to establish its affiliated specialized wholesale departments to meet the needs of commodity circulation.) These wholesale stations are independently operated economic accounting units of state-owned trading enterprises with sufficient supply capacity, working under the direct leadership of the local provincial (municipal) commercial departments (bureaus). Their task is to understand the needs of the people for commodities within the economic zone, control processing orders within the zone, control the wholesale market and allocation and wholesale prices within the zone, and do a good job in transportation and storage. Based on the plans submitted by the state-owned trade's city and county grassroots companies and the supply contracts signed by both parties, they reasonably allocate materials and ensure timely supply.

II. Work Achievements Over the Past Year and More

Over the past year and more, in the process of establishing and developing wholesale stations, the political and professional level of leading cadres and all employees of state-owned trade departments at all levels has improved, and they have further clarified the idea of serving production and the people's lives. The organization and planning of state-owned trade have been strengthened, which has accelerated the turnover of commodities and funds and reduced commodity circulation costs. The wholesale and retail departments of state-owned trade, as well as the wholesale and business leading departments (provincial and municipal companies), have implemented a clear division of labor and improved business management. These are specifically reflected in the following aspects:

First, the wholesale stations have changed the past decentralized and disorganized state of procurement work, implemented unified and planned procurement, overcome the blindness of market procurement work, promoted the potential of industrial production, and enabled it to produce in a planned manner according to the needs of the people. In this way, state-owned trade has gradually played the role of serving production. Since the establishment of wholesale stations, they have implemented complete sales of state-owned industrial and local state-owned industrial products such as paper, glass, soda ash, sugar, and matches. The quantity of processing orders placed with private industry has also greatly increased. At the same time, based on the needs of consumers, the wholesale stations have proposed opinions on improving product specifications and quality to producers through processing, ordering, and guaranteed sales, promoting the production departments to improve their work and increase production.

Second, the rational organization of commodity flow according to economic zoning has reduced allocation levels, shortened commodity transit time, rationally used funds, and reduced commodity surcharges. Here, a comparison can be made between the situation before and after the establishment of wholesale stations:

When allocating materials according to administrative divisions, many of the commodities purchased by Northeast China from within the customs were transported to the Northeast District Company in Shenyang, and then distributed to the provincial and municipal companies. The provincial and municipal companies adopted the method of re-distributing to their subordinate city and county companies, and the county companies then distributed to their subordinate town stores. Materials allocated by the Northeast District Company to the Tie岭 County Company of Liaoxi Province, which is close to Shenyang, had to be transported to Jinzhou first, and then transported back to Tie岭. If too many materials were allocated or they were not suitable for the needs of the local people, they had to be returned to Shenyang along the original route. The allocation of goods through three levels of companies—large administrative district, province, and county—inevitably led to price increases at each level, and a single commodity had to use three sets of funds, which wasted a lot of manpower, materials, and financial resources.

After the establishment of wholesale stations according to economic zoning, commodities purchased by Northeast China from within the customs can be directly transported to the wholesale stations, and large quantities of whole-truck commodities can sometimes be directly transported to grassroots companies. Under normal circumstances, the circulation time can be shortened by half a month compared to the fastest previous standard. The "less-than-truckload consignment method of consolidation, transit, and distribution" is used for scattered commodities, which can save half of the freight. The commodities sold by Northeast China to within the customs have also changed from the past practice of being uniformly transported to five cities—Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Hankou, and Qingdao—and then transshipped to various places, to being directly transported to more than forty cities and counties within the customs. Under the principle of local production and sales within the Northeast region, major commodities are supplied by region, basically eliminating the phenomenon of reciprocal transportation and roundabout transportation. The wholesale stations have implemented the method of directly allocating products from state-owned factories to stores affiliated with grassroots companies, further shortening the commodity turnover time. Now, there is only the allocation and pricing relationship between the wholesale stations and the grassroots companies, reducing the allocation and pricing procedures of the provincial companies, which can also save a set of funds. In the first half of this year, the volume of general merchandise transportation increased by one and a half times compared with the same period last year, but the average running mileage was shortened by 18.45 percent, and transportation and miscellaneous expenses were reduced by 12 percent. Commodity supply is more timely, and the phenomenon of out-of-stock has been basically eliminated in the past year and more. The wholesale stations directly interact with production departments and grassroots companies, transfer accounts at the factory, and settle accounts with grassroots companies in a timely manner, which has increased the capital turnover rate of the general merchandise system by 0.045 times in the second quarter compared with the same period last year.

The wholesale stations have also played a significant role in organizing grassroots companies and guiding people's consumption by increasing the variety of commodities and establishing close relationships with relevant departments. The wholesale stations frequently inform upper and lower-level organizations of commodity information, mutually adjust surpluses and deficiencies, provide opinions on quickly promoting the sale of commodities, and mobilize employees to modify and sell slow-moving and defective goods. This has played a certain role in accelerating the turnover of commodities and funds.

Third, the establishment of wholesale stations has further strengthened the leadership of state-owned trade over cooperatives and private merchants, and also enhanced the planning of state-owned trade for market supply. In the past, the state-owned general merchandise company in Zhenlai County, in the southern part of Heilongjiang Province near the Baichengzi area, was very untimely in supplying the market. Local cooperatives and private merchants went directly to Shenyang to purchase goods, and the company often experienced stockpiling or out-of-stock. Now, the Baichengzi wholesale station ensures timely supply to the company, which has increased the proportion of commodities supplied to the market by the company this year, and the phenomenon of commodity stockpiling or out-of-stock has disappeared. The commodities purchased by local cooperatives and private merchants at the company have greatly increased, and the amount of goods purchased in outside markets has greatly decreased.

Fourth, the establishment of wholesale stations has further enabled state-owned trade to implement a rational division of labor, save manpower and material resources, enhance the organization of state-owned trade, and give play to the business initiative of companies at all levels. The wholesale stations have changed the supply-system management method of state-owned trade, which used to involve upper-level allocation and lower-level sales, and have overcome the phenomenon of unclear division of labor between purchasing and allocation and retail operations. This has given district and provincial companies ample time to guide the business activities of grassroots companies and study commodity supply and marketing patterns without directly engaging in business operations. The wholesale stations specialize in organizing commodity sources, controlling the wholesale market, and ensuring the supply of grassroots companies. The grassroots companies can strive to improve the accuracy of their business plans, strengthen financial management, improve labor organization, and increase work efficiency, which has played a significant role in expanding sales revenue, accelerating capital turnover, and facilitating consumers.

III. Further Improve and Strengthen the Work of Wholesale Stations

Since the establishment of wholesale stations, great achievements have been made, but it is necessary to overcome the shortcomings that still exist in their work in order to better exert their role in expanding and accelerating commodity circulation.

1.  Rapidly establish and improve specialized commodity wholesale departments and strengthen research on production and sales situations to promote the planning of production. At present, the wholesale stations themselves do not have a detailed division of labor, and their business work is managed by a few people in the business section, so there is still blindness in purchasing and sales work. Therefore, it is necessary to rapidly establish specialized wholesale departments, study the production and sales patterns of various commodities, and implement a responsibility system from production to consumption in order to integrate production and sales, so as to master and control the wholesale market, improve the organization and technology of wholesale business, and meet the needs of consumers.

2.  It is necessary to overcome the remnants of the supply-system thinking and conscientiously implement economic accounting. At present, the funds of the wholesale stations have not yet been determined, and commodity inventory is still gradually increasing, which affects capital turnover and commercial credit. At the same time, various quotas have not yet been formulated, and there are still many unreasonable phenomena in commodity surcharges. Therefore, it is necessary to quickly clarify property, verify the funds of wholesale stations and city and county companies, abolish credit transactions, and implement allocation and settlement. At the same time, a quota management system should be implemented to determine quotas for commodity inventory, capital turnover rate, and commodity circulation costs, and gradually formulate quotas for personnel sales revenue and commodity loss rate, so that there is a clear understanding of purchasing, inventory, and sales.

3.  Overcome the phenomena of insufficient planning, non-strict implementation of contracts, and lack of coordination, establish a linkage responsibility system for each commodity circulation link, and implement a contract system. At present, the wholesale stations and city and county companies still lack a serious attitude towards plans and supply contracts; the internal organizational work and procedures of some wholesale stations are extremely chaotic, which seriously affects commodity circulation. Therefore, it is necessary to link the seven links of purchasing, transportation, storage, pricing, allocation, sales, and settlement into a whole, unify steps, closely combine, implement a contract system, establish a set of scientific linkage responsibility system, and improve work efficiency, so that state-owned trade can form the power of a unified whole.

Planning is an indicator for implementing policies and completing tasks, and contracts are a means to ensure the realization of plans. They are also the main method to make work more standardized, overcome the blindness of purchasing and sales, oppose the supply-system thinking, and implement economic accounting. It is necessary to oppose the liberal and bureaucratic attitude taken towards the national commodity circulation plan and contract system, continuously expand and accelerate commodity circulation, and enhance the leading role of state-owned trade in the market.

    东北国营贸易系统建立批发站以来的成就
    本报特约记者  陈新
    一、建立批发站的经过
    东北国营贸易的商业网，是随着东北各地人民政府的建立，陆续组织起来的。全区商品流转的组织工作，也是按照行政系统（省、县、市），由上而下进行的。这种作法在经济恢复及改建时期，对于掌握市场、平稳物价、有重点地扶植工业生产和供应人民生活的需要，曾经发挥了巨大的作用。但随着大规模经济建设的开始和人民购买力的不断提高，这种作法已经不能适应客观的需要。因为这种作法使得商品调拨、作价和使用资金的层次过多，加以分配与供应计划不准确，组织工作与手续、制度不衔接，就可能发生国营贸易计划和市场脱节的现象，对合作社及私商也不能发挥应有的领导作用。
    为了改变这种情况，东北贸易部学习了苏联按经济区划原则建立工业品批发站的先进经验，在一九五一年七月间，按东北区内的经济区划原则，在沈阳、旅大、长春、哈尔滨等地先后建立了花纱布和百货批发站各十五处（为了进一步促进产销结合，贯彻经济核算制，东北贸易部现正遵照中央商业部关于建立批发站的决定的精神，根据批发与零售合理分工及把商品划细的原则，整顿批发站，并开始建立其所属专业批发部，以适应商品流转的需要）。这种批发站是国营贸易企业有充分供应能力的独立经营的经济核算单位，在当地省（市）商业厅（局）直接领导下进行工作。其任务是根据本经济区划内人民对商品的需要，掌握区划内的加工订货，掌握区划内的批发市场与调拨、批发价格，作好运输保管工作；依据国营贸易的市县基层公司所提报的计划，以及双方签订的供应合同，合理地分拨物资，保证及时供应。
    二、一年多以来的工作成就
    一年多以来，在建立和发展批发站的过程中，各级国营贸易部门的领导干部与全体职工的政治和业务水平提高了，进一步明确了为生产和为人民生活服务的思想；国营贸易的组织性与计划性增强了，这就加速了商品与资金的周转，降低了商品流转费用；国营贸易的批发与零售部门、批发与业务领导部门（省市公司）实行了明确的分工，改进了经营管理。这些，具体表现在下述几个方面：
    第一、批发站改变了过去采购工作的分散、零乱状态，实行统一的有计划的采购，克服了市场采购工作的盲目性，促使工业生产发挥了潜在力量，并使它根据人民的需要有计划的生产，这样，国营贸易就逐渐发挥了为生产服务的作用。批发站成立以来，对国营工业和地方国营工业产品——纸张、玻璃、曹达灰、砂糖、火柴等已全部实行包销。向私人工业的加工订货的数量也大大增加了。同时，各批发站根据消费者的需要，通过加工、定货、包销，向生产者提出改进产品规格质量的意见，推动了生产部门改进工作和提高生产。
    第二、按经济区划合理组织商品流动，减少了调拨层次，缩短了商品运转时间，合理使用了资金，降低了商品附加费。这里可以把批发站成立前后的情形作一个比较：
    在按行政区划调拨物资时，东北从关内采购的商品，很多是运到沈阳东北区公司，再分配给各省、市公司，各省、市公司采用再分拨给所属市县公司，县公司再分配给所属城镇商店。东北区公司分配给靠近沈阳的辽西省铁岭县公司的物资，要先运到锦州。再走回头路运到铁岭。如果物资调拨过多或不适合当地人民的需要，还得按照原路线返回沈阳。货物经过大行政区、省、县三级公司实行调拨，势必形成层层加价的现象，并且一种商品要使用三套资金，这就浪费了大量的人力、物力和财力。
    按经济区划建立批发站以后，东北向关内采购的商品，可直接运到批发站，大宗整车商品有时可直接运到基层公司。在一般正常情况下，可比以前流转最快的标准再缩短半个月。零星商品采用“零担装整车中转分运法”，可节省一半运费。东北到关内出售的商品，也改变了过去统一运往北京、天津、上海、汉口、青岛五城市，再转运各地的办法，而直接运到关内四十余个市县。东北区内的产品在就地产销的原则下，主要商品实行分区供应，基本上消灭了相向运输和迂回运输的现象。批发站对国营工厂的产品实行了就厂矿直接拨到基层公司所属商店的办法，更加缩短了商品周转的时间。现在只有批发站与基层公司的调拨、作价关系，减去了省公司的调拨、作价的手续，还可以节省一套资金。今年上半年百货商品运输量较去年同期增加一倍半，但运行里程平均缩短了百分之十八点四五，运杂费降低了百分之十二。商品供应更加及时，一年多以来已基本上消除了脱销现象。批发站和生产部门、基层公司直接来往，和工厂就厂转账，和基层公司及时结算，使百货系统第二季度资金周转率比去年同期提高了百分之零点零四五次。
    批发站通过增加商品品种并和有关部门建立密切联系的方法，组织基层公司，指导人民消费，这种作用也是很显著的。各批发站经常向上下级机构通报商品情况，互相调剂有无提供迅速推销商品的意见，并发动职工改制和销售冷背残货。这对加速商品和资金的周转，都起了一定的作用。
    第三、由于批发站的建立，更加强了国营贸易对合作社和私商的领导，也增强了国营贸易对市场供应的计划性。黑龙江省南部靠近白城子地区的镇赉县国营百货公司，过去对市场的供应很不及时，当地合作社和私商直接到沈阳办货，该公司经常发生积压商品或商品脱销的现象。现在白城子批发站保证对该公司及时供应，使得该公司今年供应市场商品的比重增加了，商品积压或脱销的现象也没有了。当地合作社和私商在该公司采购的商品大大增加，在外地市场的进货量大大减少了。
    第四、由于建立了批发站，进一步使国营贸易内部实行了合理分工，节省了人力、物力，增强了国营贸易的组织性，发挥了各级公司的经营积极性。批发站使国营贸易改变了过去那种上拨下卖的供给制式的经营方法，克服了购拨业务与零售业务分工不明确的现象，使区、省公司不再直接经营业务，有充分时间指导基层公司的业务活动与研究商品供销规律。而批发站则专门组织商品来源，掌握批发市场，保证基层公司的供应。基层公司则可以努力提高经营计划的准确性，加强财务管理，改进劳动组织，提高工作效率，这对扩大卖钱额，加速资金周转，便利消费群众起了很大作用。
    三、进一步改进与加强批发站工作
    批发站建立以来，已经取得很大的成绩，但必须克服它在工作中还存在的若干缺点，以便更好地发挥其扩大与加速商品流转的作用。
    一、迅速建立和健全专业商品批发部，加强对产销情况的研究，以促进生产的计划性。目前批发站本身业务分工不细，它的业务工作是依靠业务科少数人来管理的，因此在购销工作上还存在着盲目性。因此，必须迅速建立专业批发部，研究各种商品的产销规律，实行从生产到消费的负责制，使产销结合起来，以便掌握与控制批发市场，改善批发业务的组织和技术，适应消费者的需要。
    二、必须克服供给制思想残余，认真贯彻经济核算制。目前各批发站的资金还没有确定，商品库存量还在逐渐加大，影响了资金周转和商业信用。同时，各种定额也还没有制定，商品附加费还有许多不合理现象。因此，必须迅速弄清财产，核定批发站与市、县公司的资金，取消信用往来，实行划拨清算。同时应该实行定额管理制度，确定商品库存量、资金周转率、商品流转费等定额，逐步地制定人员卖钱额，商品损耗率等定额，作到进货、存货、销货都能心中有数。
    三、克服计划不周、不严格执行合同和互不衔接等现象，建立各个商品流转环节的联系责任制，并贯彻合同制。目前批发站和市、县公司，对待计划和供应合同，还缺乏严肃的态度；部分批发站内部组织工作和手续制度异常混乱，严重地影响了商品流转。因此，必须把采购、运输、保管、作价、调拨、销售、结算七个环节联结成一个整体，统一步调，密切结合，贯彻合同制，建立一套科学的联系责任制度，提高工作效率，使国营贸易结成统一的整体的力量。
    计划是执行政策完成任务的指标，合同是保证实现计划的手段，又是使工作走向正规，克服购销盲目性，反对供给制思想，贯彻经济核算制的主要方法。必须反对那种对国家商品流转计划和合同制度采取的自由主义和官僚主义态度，不断扩大与加速商品流转，增强国营贸易在市场上的领导作用。更正
