    "The Red Flag Still Flies in Our Village!"
    ——The Patriotic Health Campaign in Sixth Village, Heshang Town, Xiaoshan County, Zhejiang Province
    Peng Ruchun
    Sixth Village, Heshang Town, is one of the villages in Xiaoshan County, Zhejiang Province, that has done the best job in patriotic health work. On October 10th, I and several comrades visited this mountain village. From the situation reflected in this mountain village, we can see how profound an impact the patriotic health movement has had on the countryside.
    We set off from Heshang Town, passed through five li of dense bamboo forest, and arrived at our destination. What impresses people most is the extraordinary cleanliness of the roads inside and outside this mountain village. In this deep autumn season, the mountain village should be covered with fallen leaves. But not here. Each section of the road is cleaned by the villagers in sections according to their own established system, and even the weeds on the roadside are often trimmed to maintain a clean environment. This village is tightly surrounded by mountains, full of pine trees and bamboo forests, and a clear stream runs straight through the center of the village. This is a beautiful place, and the clean environment makes it even more beautiful.
    When we arrived at Sixth Village, the village head and the director of the village farmers' association were not at home. That day, because of the rain, some young lads were idle at home, and they and the director of the village women's federation warmly received us, telling us about the achievements of their village's health work without any omissions. They spoke with such excitement, full of pride and confidence.
    Since the patriotic health campaign was launched in Heshang Town, the town has held four hygiene red flag competitions. The first red flag was won by Third Village; Sixth Village was unwilling to lag behind, and the masses of the whole village were mobilized, and everyone was determined to do a good job in hygiene and strive to hang the red flag in their own village. Sure enough, the red flag has been hanging in Sixth Village for the subsequent three times. Their patriotic health work has been done better each time. Now, among the 161 households in the village, 144 have been rated as first-class clean households.
    "In our own village, red flag competitions have also been held between groups; each group has two inspectors, who check the cleanliness of each household every day. Each household has a record sheet pasted on the wall. If it is a clean household, the inspector will draw a '○' on the sheet; if it is not clean, a '×' will be drawn on it. Everyone knows that doing a good job in cleaning and hygiene is beneficial to every family and everyone, and knows that this is a practical action against the American aggressors' germ warfare. Everyone wants to get a '○', so everyone works hard on sanitation!" As everyone was talking, the director of the village women's federation brought us a bamboo rat trap to show us. This tool was made by Huang Hengshui in their village. It is simple in structure and easy to use. Now every household is equipped with this kind of rat trap. Sixth Village averages more than ten rats caught per household; Huang Hengshui alone has caught thirty-two. Huang Hengshui is the militia squad leader of the village. In the patriotic health campaign, he not only did a good job in his own and his family's hygiene work, but also led the militia to clean the public places in the village, and also organized a clean mutual aid group to help families lacking labor to carry out major cleaning. Therefore, everyone in the village recognizes him as a model for health work. Huang Hengshui said excitedly to us: "Last year, I was either sick or had sores for a total of three months; this year, after doing a good job in hygiene, I haven't had any illnesses." This is not only Huang Hengshui's words, but many people in the village say the same. Indeed, they have a deep understanding of this point.
    The young people in the village accompanied us on a tour of the village again. Here, all the wells have been covered, and the edges of the wells have been plastered with cement, and no vegetable leaves or sewage can be seen next to the wells. All toilets and manure pits are well covered, and many toilet doors have been newly installed. Every household has a family patriotic health covenant and a group hygiene inspection form pasted on the wall. The inside of the house is truly clean and hygienic. The wood and grass piles outside the house are neatly placed on one side. Each household has at least one enameled chamber pot with a long-handled wooden lid; there are also fly swatters made of bamboo strips. The whole village has achieved separation of humans and livestock. This is a very simple matter: at first, the villagers were unwilling to keep the pigs outside, but when everyone understood the benefits of separating humans and livestock, they automatically thought of ways to keep the pigs in the outer sheds; Song Huanquan, the group leader of the seventh group, even lent his empty pig pen to Song Guigen to keep pigs.
    Almost all the young people here have developed the habit of brushing their teeth. One hundred and twelve households use separate face cloths, and nearly half of the families have also implemented a public chopsticks system. We asked several children and old ladies why the face cloths and bowls and chopsticks should be used separately. They replied: "It won't spread trachoma!" "It won't spread disease!" Their answers were satisfactory.
    We also visited three families in Sixth Village. The first was Huang Manqing's family. There were three people in his family, and all three happened to be out that day. The director of the farmers' association told us that this family did not pay much attention to hygiene at the beginning because they did not fully understand the meaning of the patriotic health campaign, but after the first hygiene inspection, they quickly changed. Since then, they have been rated as first-class clean households every time they have been inspected for hygiene. And they are active members of public health work. The stove and tables and stools in their home are wiped very clean, and the bowls, chopsticks and face cloths are used separately. Then we visited Zhang Yinxiang's home. Zhang Yinxiang is a mother of four children, the oldest of whom is ten years old and the youngest only three days old; her husband works outside all day, and she takes care of the children and cooks at home by herself. Not only does she take good care of the children, but she also keeps the upstairs and downstairs clean. She keeps the towels and small handkerchiefs used by the children separate. Like all mothers, she spoke her heart, saying, "Mothers always want their children to be healthy and not get sick, don't you think?" Then she said, "As soon as I heard that doing a good job in hygiene is a practical action against American germ warfare, I got excited." Finally, we visited the home of the cleanest household in Sixth Village, the military family of old lady Song. Old lady Song is almost sixty years old, one of her sons is in the army, and the other two sons are in Shanghai. There are only she and an eighty-two-year-old mother-in-law at home. These two old ladies are very healthy. They cleaned their home very cleanly. Everyone thinks it is the best in the village, and the village cadres called on the whole village to learn from them. When we went to see her, she said excitedly: "Chairman Mao called on us to do a good job in hygiene, to make us clean and tidy, all for the sake of everyone not getting sick, for the sake of everyone's health."
    When we were about to leave the village, the villagers repeatedly asked us to give them advice on improving hygiene work. The masses all said with full confidence: "Next time you come again, the red flag will still be hanging in our village!"

    “红旗还是挂在我们村子里！”
    ——浙江省萧山县河上镇第六村的爱国卫生运动
    彭汝春
    河上镇第六村，是浙江省萧山县全县爱国卫生工作搞得最好的村庄之一。十月十日，我和几个同志访问了这个山村。从这个山村里所反映出来的情况，我们可以看出爱国卫生运动在农村中已起了多么深刻的影响。
    我们从河上镇出发，穿过了五里路长的密密丛丛的竹林，到达了目的地。首先使人赞叹不已的是这个山村里里外外的道路异常洁净。像这样的深秋季节，山村里该是落叶满地了吧。可是这里并不。每段道路都由村民们按照自己订出来的制度分段负责打扫，就连路边的杂草也经常修整，保持环境的清洁卫生。这个村庄是被群山紧紧环抱着的，山上满长着松树和竹林，一条清澈的溪水，直从村庄的中心穿过。这是一个风景幽美的地方，清洁的环境使它更加秀丽了。
    我们到第六村的时候，村长、村农会主任都不在家。那天因为下雨，有些年青小伙子闲在家里，他们和村妇联主任热情地接待着我们，毫无遗漏地把他们村里的卫生工作成绩告诉了我们。他们说得那样的兴奋，充满了骄傲和自信。
    自从爱国卫生运动在河上镇展开后，镇里举行过四次卫生红旗大竞赛。第一次红旗是第三村夺去的；第六村不甘落后，全村群众都动起来了，大家决心要把卫生工作做好，争取把红旗挂到自己的村子里。果然，以后三次红旗就一直挂在第六村。他们的爱国卫生工作一次比一次搞得好，现在全村一百六十一户人家中，已有一百四十四户被评为甲等清洁户了。
    “在我们自己村里，组和组之间也进行过红旗竞赛；每一组有两个检查员，每天挨户检查清洁。每户人家墙上贴一张纪录表，如果是清洁户，就由检查员在表上画一个‘○’，不清洁的就在上面画个‘×’。大家都晓得搞好清洁卫生工作对每个家庭、每个人都有好处，晓得这是反对美国强盗细菌战的实际行动。大家都要争得个‘○’，这样大家都下劲搞卫生工作啦！”大家正在谈着，村妇联会主任拿了一个竹制捕鼠器来给我们看。这器具是他们村里黄恒水制造的，构造简单，使用方便。现在每户人家都置备有这种捕鼠器。第六村平均每户捕鼠在十只以上；单是黄恒水一个人就捕捉了三十二只。黄恒水是村里的民兵小队长，在爱国卫生运动中他不但把自己和家里的卫生工作搞得很好，而且领导民兵打扫村里的公共场所，还组织了清洁互助组帮助缺乏劳动力的人家进行大扫除。因此全村的人都公认他为卫生工作模范。黄恒水兴奋地对我们说：“去年一年当中，我总有三个月不是生病就是生疮；今年搞好了卫生，什么病都没有生。”这不仅是黄恒水一个人的话，村里许多人都这样说。的确，他们对这一点体会得太深了。
    村里的青年人又陪我们在村里参观了一遍。这里，所有的水井都加上了盖，井边都用洋灰抹过，井旁看不到一片菜叶或一点污水。所有的厕所、粪坑都盖得很好，不少厕所的门都是新装上去的。每一家住屋的墙壁上都贴着家庭爱国卫生公约和小组卫生检查表。屋里真正做到了清洁卫生。屋外的柴堆、草堆都整整齐齐地放在一边。每户至少有一个长柄木盖的瓦钵痰盂；还有用竹片劈成的苍蝇拍子。全村都做到了人畜分居。这是一桩非常不简单的事：起先村民们都不愿把猪关在外面，但是当大家懂得人畜分居的好处之后，都自动想办法把猪关到外边棚屋中去；七组小组长宋焕铨并把自己空着的猪栏借给宋桂根关猪。
    这里的青年人差不多都已养成刷牙的习惯，有一百十二户人家都是各人分用洗脸布，将近半数的家庭还实行了公筷制。我们问了几个小孩和老太太为啥洗脸布和碗筷要分开用，他们回答说：“不会传染砂眼的呀！”“不会传染疾病的呀！”他们的回答是令人满意的。
    我们又访问了第六村的三个家庭。第一个是黄满庆的家。他家里一共三个人，这一天正巧三个人都出去了。农会主任告诉我们，这一家人在开始时因对爱国卫生运动的意义认识不足，没有很好注意卫生，后来经过第一次检查清洁，他们就很快转变过来了。以后每次检查卫生，他们都被评为甲等清洁户。而且他们又是公共卫生工作的积极分子。他们家里的灶头、桌凳都揩拭得十分清洁，碗筷和洗脸布都分开用。接着我们又访问了章银香的家。章银香是有四个孩子的妈妈，她最大的一个孩子十岁，小的一个才断奶三天；丈夫成天在外面干活，家里带孩子、烧饭等事都由她一个人做。她不但把孩子带得很好，而且楼上楼下都搞得干干净净。她把孩子们用的毛巾、小手帕都分别开来。像所有做母亲的一样，她说出了她的心底话，她说：“做娘的总是巴不得小孩身体好、不生病，你说是不是？”接着她又说：“我一听到说搞好卫生工作就是反对美国细菌战的实际行动，我的劲头就来了。”最后我们访问了第六村全村最清洁户、军属宋老太太的家。宋老太太快六十岁了，她的一个儿子参军了，另两个儿子在上海，家里只有她和一个八十二岁的老婆婆。这两位老太太身体挺康健，她们把家里打扫得十分清洁，大家都认为是全村第一，村干部号召全村向她们学习。当我们去看她的时候，她兴奋地说：“毛主席号召我们搞好卫生，要我们弄得清清爽爽，都是为了大家不生病，为了大家身体好。”
    当我们快要离开这个村的时候，村里的人都再三地要求我们给他们提出改进卫生工作的意见。群众都信心百倍地说：“下次你们再来，红旗还是挂在我们村子里！”
