    Thank You, Soviet Doctors

    To the Editor: I am a railway worker. On the night of December 10, 1951, on a transportation line on the Korean front, I was burned on my hands, legs, and face by a gasoline bomb dropped by enemy aircraft. I was sent to the hospital. A few days later, when the doctor changed my dressing, I used a lot of effort to open my eyes. At this time, I saw that the upper half of my fingers had fallen off, and the remaining half looked like a big mulberry. I thought, "It's over, a person can't do anything without fingers." I asked the doctor, "Are my hands still useful?" The doctor replied with concern, "As long as the wound heals, you can still hold things with your hands." But as the wound festered, the only remaining half-fingers grew together crookedly, forming two deformed fleshy bumps.
    In January of this year, I was transferred to Benxi Hospital. On February 23, I was transferred to Changchun Hospital. At this time, I could stand up if someone helped me. But my hands were still two fleshy bumps. The skin on my face also contracted as the scar tissue contracted, and my eyelids turned outward, unable to even cover my eyeballs. By May, the wound had completely healed, and the ophthalmologist performed skin graft surgery on my eyes, and my eyesight gradually recovered. I asked the doctor again, "Is there any way to treat my hands?" The doctor said, "In the future, we can separate the bent half-fingers." I asked, "Can they be straightened?" The doctor said, "If the tendons are not damaged, they can be moved." In early June, I arrived at the Beijing Railway General Hospital via the Tianjin Railway Hospital. After examination, the doctor told me, "We can't perform surgery here, we may have to transfer you to another hospital for treatment." I was very anxious when I heard this.
    At this time, I saw in the newspaper that the Beijing Soviet Red Cross Hospital had begun accepting patients, and I was very happy. I thought, it would be great if the leadership sent me to the Beijing Soviet Red Cross Hospital for treatment. My wish finally came true. On July 16, after the surgical director of the Beijing Soviet Red Cross Hospital, Vaskrisinsky, and Soviet expert Dumansky examined my wound, Vaskrisinsky patted me on the shoulder kindly and said, "We can not only treat you, but also make you a useful person. In the future, you can use your hand to hold a pen and write, and you can also work." I was indescribably happy to hear this. From then on, Vaskrisinsky taught me to do muscle and joint exercises for my hands every day, and instructed the doctors to help me. When checking the ward, he always touched my hands and asked if it hurt, and how the joints were moving. The president and vice president also often came to the ward to see me. After repeated examinations and studies, they performed surgery on me on August 4. A few days later, Vaskrisinsky brought a wooden stick and asked me to try to hold it with my hands, and I immediately grabbed it. He helped me write with a pen with a smile on his face. At first, my hand trembled with pain, and I could only barely write a few words. He told me to practice moving it more. Gradually, my hand didn't hurt so much, and the writing became more neat, and I could even draw. He said to me very happily, "Congratulations, you will soon be able to return to your job!" Then he invited ophthalmologists and dermatology and venereology experts to consult together to prepare for surgery to allow my eyelids to close.
    I thank the Soviet experts and doctors for bringing me light and health!

### 感谢苏联大夫

    感谢苏联大夫
    编辑同志：我是一个铁路工人。一九五一年十二月十日夜间，在朝鲜前线一条运输线上，被敌机投下的汽油弹烧坏了手、腿和脸部。我被送到了医院。几天之后，大夫给我换药的时候，我用了很大的劲才睁开眼睛。这时，我看见我的手指头的上半截都掉了，剩下的半截很像个大桑椹。我想：“完了，人要是没有手指头啥也不能干了。”我问大夫：“我的手还有用吗？”大夫很关切地回答：“只要伤口愈合，手还是可以夹东西的。”可是随着伤口的化脓，仅有的半截指头也弯弯曲曲地长在一起，形成了两个畸形的肉疙瘩。
    今年一月，我被转送到本溪医院。二月二十三日又转到长春医院。这时，要是有人扶着，我能够站起来了。可是手上依然是两个肉疙瘩。脸皮也随着伤口瘢痕的收缩而收缩，眼皮向外翻转，连眼球也包不住了。到五月间伤口完全愈合，眼科大夫给我做了眼的补皮手术，眼的视力才逐渐恢复。我又问了一下大夫：“我的手还有没有办法治？”大夫说：“将来可以把半截弯曲着的手指头分开来。”我问：“还能直起来吗？”大夫说：“假若肌腱不坏，它是能够活动的。”六月上旬，我经天津铁路医院到了北京铁路总医院。经过检查，大夫告诉我：“这里不能做手术，可能要让你转院治疗。”听了这话，我很着急。
    这时，我从报纸上看到了北京苏联红十字医院开始收容病人的消息，我真高兴极了。我想，要是领导方面送我到北京苏联红十字医院去治疗，那再好也没有了。我的愿望终于实现了。七月十六日，北京苏联红十字医院外科主任瓦斯克里辛斯基和苏联专家杜曼斯基检查了我的伤口以后，瓦斯克里辛斯基很亲切地拍着我的肩膀说：“我们不仅能给你治疗，而且要使你变成一个有用的人，你将来可以用手夹着笔写字，还可以作工作。”我听了这话，心里有说不出的高兴。从此以后，瓦斯克里辛斯基每天教我做手的肌肉和关节运动，并吩咐医师帮助我。查病房时，他总是摸着我的手问我疼不疼，关节活动的情形怎么样。院长和副院长也经常到病房来看我。经过他们三番五次的检查和研究，八月四日给我作了手术。过了几天，瓦斯克里辛斯基拿来一根木棍，叫我用手夹着试试，我一下把它夹住了。他满脸笑容地帮助我拿笔写字。开始的时候，手疼得发抖，我只能勉强地写几个字。他便嘱咐我多练习活动。渐渐地，手也不太疼了，字也写得端正了一些，而且还能画画。他非常高兴地向我说：“祝贺你，你很快就能回到工作岗位上去啦！”随后他又请眼科、皮肤花柳科专家来一同会诊，准备给我作手术，使我的眼皮能够合上。
    我感谢苏联专家、大夫，给我带来了光明，带来了健康！
