    Congratulations on Czechoslovakia's Great Victory Against the Treacherous Conspiracy
    The Czechoslovak State Court began the trial of the treasonous conspiracy center headed by Slánský in Prague on November 20 and concluded the trial on November 27. The Czechoslovak State Court announced the death sentences and life imprisonment for the treasonous criminals Slánský and others. This is a major victory for Czechoslovakia against the treacherous conspiracy, and a major victory for the forces of peace and democracy in the struggle against the aggressive conspiracy of American imperialism.
    The "Indictment on the Anti-State Conspiracy Center Headed by Rudolf Slánský" and the confessions of Slánský and other criminals thoroughly prove that the criminals of the treasonous conspiracy center—Slánský, Geminder, and Clementis, and their ilk—are extremely vile and despicable class enemies who infiltrated and lurked within the ranks of the Czechoslovak working class, and are loyal lackeys and servants of American imperialism. They once seized leadership positions in the Czechoslovak Communist Party and the Republic's government departments, accepted orders from American, British, and French imperialist spy agencies, and engaged in conspiracies to sell out the sovereignty and independence of the Czechoslovak Republic. They attempted to undermine the close alliance and friendly relations between the Czechoslovak people and the Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries, revive capitalism, and drag Czechoslovakia into the imperialist camp. Therefore, the just trial in Prague not only thoroughly exposed the vile faces of Slánský, Geminder, and Clementis, and their ilk, in betraying national sovereignty and national interests, but also, before the people of the world, once again irrefutably exposed the conspiracies and tricks of American imperialism in carrying out aggression. This is another huge blow to American imperialism.
    The trial in Prague proves that the conspiracy of American imperialism to carry out sabotage activities against Czechoslovakia was premeditated and carefully planned over a long period. Since the Soviet army liberated Czechoslovakia in 1945, the main lackeys of the imperialist spies in Czechoslovakia were the traitorous group headed by Beneš, who betrayed the interests of the Czechoslovak people. They used their status as a then-legal political party, seized important positions in the Republic's government, and, under the direction of American imperialism, carried out sabotage activities to subvert the Czechoslovak Republic. The traitorous group headed by Slánský, who betrayed the interests of the working class, under the direction of imperialism, systematically infiltrated the organization of the Czechoslovak Communist Party. Slánský arrived in Slovakia in the early stages of the Slovak People's Uprising in 1944 and immediately actively implemented the imperialist plan to re-enslave Slovakia. After Czechoslovakia suppressed the counter-revolutionary coup by the Beneš group and dissolved the reactionary parties in February 1948, American imperialism intensified its instigation of the servants of the treasonous conspiracy center headed by Slánský to carry out counter-revolutionary conspiracies from within the Czechoslovak Communist Party. Slánský, who had seized the position of General Secretary of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, actively selected Trotskyites, bourgeois nationalists, and spies sent back by imperialist countries and placed them in important positions in the Party and state organs. When placing these people, Slánský concealed and exaggerated their despicable history, remained silent about their sabotage activities, and even instructed his loyal pawns to seize leadership positions in the state security organs to cover up their sabotage activities. This lackey of imperialism carried out the betrayal of the interests of the Czechoslovak people in this way.
    The Slánský treasonous conspiracy center was a typical American spy organization. It was no accident that American imperialism chose this group of people to be its lackeys. The members of this treasonous conspiracy center were all Trotskyites, "Zionists," Titoists, and bourgeois nationalists, etc. They were all traitors to the revolution. Slánský came from a family of a large merchant; Sling was the son of a German factory owner and a staff member of the German intelligence agency; Clementis was a Slovak bourgeois nationalist and a spy for the German intelligence agency; Geminder had sought refuge with the reactionary German nationalist group and was an opportunistic Trotskyite. It is well known that when the United States Congress passed the so-called "Mutual Security Act of 1951" with an appropriation of 100 million US dollars, it claimed that the money was used to provide for "suitable, selected people" who had fled from or still resided in people's democratic countries to engage in activities against the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries. Slánský and his ilk were, of course, the most "suitable" people in the eyes of American imperialism. This group of opportunists with extremely bad qualities was hired by the American spy agency to engage in conspiracies to subvert the Czechoslovak Republic.
    The Slánský treasonous conspiracy center had countless connections with the Yugoslav Tito gang. It is well known that the Tito gang is the most loyal lackey and tool of aggression of American imperialism. This group has sold out all the interests of the Yugoslav people to the American imperialists and turned Yugoslavia into a base for American aggression against the Eastern European people's democratic countries. The conspiracy of American imperialism to instigate the Slánský treasonous conspiracy center to carry out sabotage activities was aimed at turning Czechoslovakia into a second Yugoslavia and throwing the Czechoslovak people into a fate of perpetual enslavement. The Slánský treasonous conspiracy center case, like the Kostov treason case previously discovered in Bulgaria and the Rajk treason case discovered in Hungary, is part of the American imperialist plan for aggression against the Eastern European people's democratic countries. The purpose of the American imperialist plan is to undermine the sovereignty and independence of the people's democratic countries, establish an anti-Soviet group in Eastern Europe, and turn the Eastern European countries into bases for it to launch a new war, just like Yugoslavia. This is part of the strategic plan of American imperialism to instigate a new world war. However, this ambitious conspiracy of American imperialism has been shattered one by one in the face of the people of the Eastern European people's democratic countries who have a high degree of unity and vigilance.
    The cracking of the Slánský treasonous conspiracy center cut off a sinister bloody hand of American imperialism that had reached into the Eastern European people's democratic countries, which has obviously caused the American government to panic. The United States Department of State has repeatedly stated that the United States government and the United States spy agency have nothing to do with the various sinister conspiracies instigated in Bulgaria, Poland, and Czechoslovakia. These American conspirators, whose hands are stained with the blood of the people, always insist that these conspiracies against free people and countries have nothing to do with the United States government and the United States intelligence agencies after their shameful conspiracies are exposed. The recently published note from the United States Department of State to the government of the Czechoslovak Republic attempts to cover up the traces of their crimes in instigating the Slánský treasonous conspiracy center. However, the trial and judgment of the Czechoslovak State Court on the case of the treasonous conspiracy center headed by Slánský, based on irrefutable facts, directly proves that senior officials and diplomatic personnel of the United States government were the masterminds of this conspiracy, and also proves that the note from the United States Department of State to Czechoslovakia is a shameless lie.
    The cracking of the Slánský treasonous conspiracy center shows that the working class and other working people of Czechoslovakia have a high degree of vigilance against the sabotage activities of American imperialists and their lackeys, and are increasingly closely united around the Czechoslovak Communist Party headed by Comrade Gottwald, striving to build a better socialist life. The free and independent people's Czechoslovakia is constantly moving forward. The increasingly high labor enthusiasm and the increasingly strengthened vigilance against imperialism of the Czechoslovak working people will ensure that Czechoslovakia will always become a strong link in the great world peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union. If any imperialists and their lackeys dare to act rashly, they will surely be smashed to pieces!

### 祝捷克斯洛伐克反对叛国阴谋的大胜利

    祝捷克斯洛伐克反对叛国阴谋的大胜利
    捷克斯洛伐克国家法庭，于十一月二十日在布拉格开始审讯以斯兰斯基为首的叛国阴谋中心案。并于十一月二十七日结束审讯。捷克斯洛伐克国家法庭宣布判处斯兰斯基等叛国罪犯以死刑和无期徒刑。这是捷克斯洛伐克反对叛国阴谋的重大胜利，这是和平民主力量在反对美帝国主义侵略阴谋的斗争中一个重大的胜利。
    “关于以鲁道夫·斯兰斯基为首的反国家阴谋中心案的起诉书”和斯兰斯基等罪犯们的供词，都彻底证明了叛国阴谋中心的罪犯们——斯兰斯基、盖明德尔和克利门蒂斯之流，是混入和潜伏在捷克斯洛伐克工人阶级队伍中的极端卑鄙龌龊的阶级敌人，是美帝国主义忠顺的走狗和奴仆。他们曾窃据捷克斯洛伐克共产党和共和国政府部门的领导职位，接受美英法帝国主义间谍机关的命令，进行出卖捷克斯洛伐克共和国的主权和独立的阴谋勾当。他们企图破坏捷克斯洛伐克人民对苏联及各人民民主国家的亲密同盟和友好关系，使资本主义死灰复燃，而把捷克斯洛伐克拉进帝国主义阵营。因此，布拉格所进行的正义审讯，不仅彻底揭露了斯兰斯基、盖明德尔和克利门蒂斯之流出卖国家主权和民族利益的卑污嘴脸，而且在全世界人民面前，再一次无可辩驳地暴露了美帝国主义进行侵略的阴谋诡计。这是对美帝国主义的又一个巨大的打击。
    布拉格的审讯证明，美帝国主义对捷克斯洛伐克进行破坏活动的阴谋，是处心积虑经过长期策划的。自从一九四五年苏军解放了捷克斯洛伐克以后，捷克斯洛伐克境内帝国主义间谍的主要走狗，是以贝奈斯为首的出卖捷克斯洛伐克人民利益的叛徒集团。他们利用当时还是合法政党的地位，窃据了共和国政府的重要职位，在美帝国主义的指使下，进行颠覆捷克斯洛伐克共和国的破坏活动。而以斯兰斯基为首的背叛工人阶级利益的叛徒集团，则在帝国主义指使下，有计划地钻入了捷克斯洛伐克共产党的组织里。斯兰斯基在一九四四年斯洛伐克人民起义初期便到了斯洛伐克，并立即积极执行帝国主义重新奴役斯洛伐克的计划。在一九四八年二月，捷克斯洛伐克镇压了贝奈斯集团的反革命政变并解散了反动政党之后，美帝国主义便加紧策动以斯兰斯基为首的叛国阴谋中心的奴仆们，从捷克斯洛伐克共产党的内部来进行反革命的阴谋活动。已窃据捷克斯洛伐克共产党总书记职位的斯兰斯基，便积极地挑选由帝国主义国家派回来的托洛茨基分子、资产阶级民族主义者和间谍，安置到党和国家机构的重要位置上去。斯兰斯基在安置这些人的时候，一面对这些人的卑污的历史加以隐瞒和吹嘘，对这些人的破坏活动则默不作声；一面更指使其忠实爪牙窃据国家公安机关的领导职位，以掩护这些人的破坏活动。这个帝国主义的走狗，就是这样来进行出卖捷克斯洛伐克人民的利益的。
    斯兰斯基叛国阴谋中心，是一个典型的美国间谍组织。美帝国主义挑选了这批人来充当它的走狗，决不是偶然的。这个叛国阴谋中心的成员，都是托洛茨基分子、“犹太复国主义”者、铁托分子和资产阶级民族主义分子等。他们都是革命的叛徒。斯兰斯基出身于一个大商人的家庭；斯林是一个德国工厂老板的儿子，德国情报机关的工作人员；克利门蒂斯是一个斯洛伐克资产阶级民族主义者，德国情报机关的间谍；盖明德尔投靠过反动的德国国家主义集团，是一个投机取巧的托洛茨基分子。人所共知，美国国会在通过一亿元拨款的所谓“一九五一年共同安全法”时，曾声称这笔钱是用来供给从人民民主国家逃出来或仍居住在人民民主国家里的“适当的、挑选出来的人”，从事反对苏联和人民民主国家的活动的。斯兰斯基之流当然是美帝国主义眼中最“适当的”人了。这批品质极端恶劣的投机分子，就是在美国间谍机关的雇佣下，从事颠覆捷克斯洛伐克共和国的阴谋活动的。
    斯兰斯基叛国阴谋中心，与南斯拉夫铁托匪帮有着千丝万缕的勾结。人所共知，铁托匪帮是美帝国主义最忠顺的走狗和侵略工具。这个集团已经把南斯拉夫人民的利益全部出卖给美帝国主义者，把南斯拉夫变成了美国侵略东欧各人民民主国家的基地。美帝国主义策动斯兰斯基叛国阴谋中心进行破坏活动，就是想把捷克斯洛伐克变成南斯拉夫第二，把捷克斯洛伐克人民抛进永远被奴役的命运。斯兰斯基叛国阴谋中心案，和以前在保加利亚发现的柯斯托夫叛国案，在匈牙利发现的拉伊克叛国案一样，是美帝国主义对东欧人民民主国家侵略计划的一部分。美帝国主义的计划，目的在于破坏各人民民主国家的主权和独立，在东欧建立一个反苏集团，把东欧各国像南斯拉夫一样，变成它发动新战争的基地。这是美帝国主义煽动新的世界战争的战略计划的一部分。可是，美帝国主义这种野心勃勃的阴谋诡计，在具有高度团结和警惕性的东欧各人民民主国家人民的面前，已经被一一打得粉碎。
    斯兰斯基叛国阴谋中心的破获，斩断了美帝国主义伸进了东欧人民民主国家里的一只罪恶的血手，显然已经使得美国政府惊惶失措了。美国国务院曾经多次声明，说美国政府与美国间谍机关在保加利亚、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克境内所策动的各次罪恶阴谋无关。这些双手染满了人民鲜血的美国阴谋家，在其可耻的阴谋被揭露以后，总是一口咬定这些反对自由人民与国家的阴谋，与美国政府和美国情报机关无关。最近公布的美国国务院致捷克斯洛伐克共和国政府的照会，就是试图把他们策动斯兰斯基叛国阴谋中心的罪恶的痕迹掩盖起来。可是，捷克斯洛伐克国家法庭对以斯兰斯基为首的叛国阴谋中心案的审讯和判决，以无可置辩的事实为根据，直接证明了美国政府的高级官员和外交人员是这个阴谋中心的主使者，也证明了美国国务院致捷克斯洛伐克的照会，是无耻的撒谎。
    斯兰斯基叛国阴谋中心的被破获，说明捷克斯洛伐克的工人阶级和其他劳动人民，对于美帝国主义者和它们的走狗的破坏活动，具有高度的警惕性，并且越来越紧密地团结在以哥特瓦尔德同志为首的捷克斯洛伐克共产党的周围，为建设社会主义的美好生活而奋斗。自由而独立的人民的捷克斯洛伐克正在不断地前进，捷克斯洛伐克劳动人民这种日益高涨的劳动热情和日益加强的对帝国主义的警惕性，将保证捷克斯洛伐克永远成为以苏联为首的伟大的世界和平民主阵营中的坚强一环；任何帝国主义者和它们的走狗们如果敢于轻举妄动，那就一定会碰得头破血流！
