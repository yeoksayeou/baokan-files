    Cherish the Honor of the People's Liberation Army
    In September in Nanjing, the weather was still suffocatingly hot. A four-wheeled horse-drawn carriage sped along the wide road from Xinjiekou to Xiaolingwei. Shao Ping, a comrade from a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army, sat in the carriage, engrossed in reading "Zoya and Shura's Story," which he had just bought from the Xinhua Bookstore.
    When the carriage stopped and the driver shouted, "Xiaolingwei has arrived!" Shao Ping followed everyone off the carriage. He reached into his upper left pocket for money and suddenly realized that the 5,000 yuan Renminbi he had put in that morning was gone. He searched all his other pockets, but still couldn't find the money. What to do? It would be terrible for a People's Liberation Army soldier not to be able to pay the fare. A comrade in a blue uniform who was on the same carriage saw this situation and immediately said, "Lost your money, comrade! I'll pay your fare." The worker comrade who had been sitting next to Shao Ping took out two 1,000 yuan notes first and said, "I have change, I'll pay." Shao Ping was very moved by their friendly actions, but felt it wasn't entirely appropriate. However, the driver refused to accept their payment, saying, "Comrade, go on! It's not your fault you lost the money." Shao Ping hesitated, but the driver urged him again, "Comrade! Work is important, go on!" This immediately reminded him that he had a report to give, so he said to the driver, "I'll bring the fare to you this afternoon!" The carriage had already moved forward, and Shao Ping secretly noted the carriage number on the back and memorized the driver's face.
    At two o'clock in the afternoon, Shao Ping brought the money from his station and ran to the Xinjiekou main station to find the original carriage driver. There were many carriages at the station, but not the one from that morning. He waited anxiously until three o'clock, but still hadn't found the carriage. The unit was scheduled to watch a movie collectively at three thirty, and he still had a movie ticket in his pocket. But thinking of the Three Main Rules of Discipline and the Eight Points for Attention, he decided to sacrifice the movie and find the carriage driver. He called the responsible comrade for leave and then walked in the direction of Taiping Road.
    He walked back and forth three times on the section of road from Huangpu Road to Xinjiekou. It wasn't until four thirty that he saw the carriage coming back from Xiaolingwei. He was very excited and immediately stopped the driver and gave him the money. The driver didn't recognize him. When he explained what had happened that morning, the driver excitedly said, "Comrade, you are truly the people's army!"
    On the way back to the unit, Shao Ping felt particularly happy; because he not only felt the glory of the People's Liberation Army, but also cherished the honor of the People's Liberation Army at all times and in all places.

    珍惜解放军的荣誉
    九月的南京，天气还热得使人窒息。从新界口到孝陵卫的宽广的马路上，疾驰着一辆四轮马车。解放军某部的邵平同志坐在车厢里，低头入神地阅读着刚从新华书店买来的“卓娅与舒拉的故事”。
    当马车停下来、赶马车的高喊“孝陵卫到了！”的时候，邵平跟着大家下了车。他伸手到左上角的口袋里摸钱，突然发现早上放进口袋去的一张五千元人民币不在了。他找遍了其他口袋，还是没有钱。怎么办呢？一个解放军付不出车钱多么不好。同车一个穿蓝制服的同志看到了这个情况，立刻说：“丢了钱了吧，同志！我给你付车钱。”那个原先坐在邵平旁边的工人同志，却先拿出二张一千元的人民币，说：“我有散的，我来付。”邵平对他们这种友爱的行动十分感动，但总感到不十分妥当。然而赶马车的却不肯接受他们代付的钱，他说：“同志，你走吧！钱丢了，这不怨你。”邵平正在犹疑，赶马车的又催了一句：“同志！工作要紧，走吧！”这使他立刻想到他有工作要汇报，于是对赶马车的说：“下午我给你送车钱来！”车已经向前去了，邵平暗暗记下了马车背后的车号，认清了这个马车工人的脸孔。
    下午二点钟，邵平在驻地带好钱，一口气跑到新界口大站上找原先的马车工人。车站上有不少马车，但却没有上午的那辆车。他十分焦急地等到三点钟，还未找到这辆车子。部队在三点半集体看电影，他袋里还放着一张电影票。但他想到三大纪律和八项注意，决定牺牲看电影，一定要找到那个赶马车的。他打电话向负责同志请了假，然后顺着太平路的方向走去。
    在黄埔路到新界口的一段路上，他来回走了三次。一直到四点半，他才发现那辆马车迎面从孝陵卫回来。他非常兴奋，立刻叫住了那个赶马车的，把钱给了他。赶马车的已经认不出他了。当他说明上午的事情后，赶马车的激动地说：“同志，你们真是人民的军队啊！”
    回队的路上，邵平感到格外的愉快；因为他不但感到了人民解放军的光荣，并且随时随地珍惜着解放军的荣誉。    周浅（附图片）
