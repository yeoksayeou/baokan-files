    East African Kenyan People
    Anti-British Struggle Intensifies

    Xinhua News Agency, October 31st—Following the development of national liberation movements in North and South Africa, a struggle against imperialist colonial rule has broken out in the British East African colony of Kenya.
    For a long time, the more than five million oppressed black people of Kenya have been constantly resisting the barbaric rule and brutal exploitation of the British colonialists. In recent months, the struggle against colonial rule has further developed, as the British colonial authorities have taken further measures to suppress the national democratic movement in order to safeguard the interests of British and American capitalists' investments in Kenya. In some areas, the resistance movement has erupted into armed struggle.
    The intensification of the Kenyan people's anti-colonial movement has caused extreme panic among the British imperialist rulers. The colonial authorities declared a state of emergency on October 20 and carried out mass arrests. Among those arrested was Jomo Kenyatta, leader of the Kenya African Union, whom the colonial authorities have removed to a remote area for "disposal at will." The British government has also transferred troops from the Suez Canal Zone and the port of Colombo in Ceylon to suppress the resistance.
    The British colonial rulers are attempting to subdue the resistance of the African people by such violent means. However, the Kenyan people, regardless of the bloody suppression by the British colonial rulers, are determined to continue their struggle. A letter circulated in Nairobi, the capital of Kenya, addressed to the colonialists, expressed their determination to fight.
    The letter stated: "Barbaric actions and repressive measures, displays of force and violent rule, will not prevent us from achieving our goals. Your arrest of our leaders will not extinguish our political aspirations... We will continue to fight you for freedom."
    The Kenya African Union has elected a new leadership to replace the arrested leaders and has put forward the following demands: the abolition of all racial discrimination, land for the African people, the African people should enjoy equal electoral and labor rights, freedom for African labor to organize trade unions, and freedom of speech, assembly, and association.
    The Kenyan people's struggle against colonial oppression has received the sympathy of other African peoples. The Executive Committee of the African League in Britain passed a resolution protesting against the British use of troops and large-scale suppression against the Kenyan people who are fighting for their democratic rights and against colonial oppression. Indigenous East African troops in the Suez Canal Zone refused orders to go to Kenya to carry out suppression and clashed with British troops.
    News has it that this movement of the Kenyan people is now also developing in Uganda and Tanganyika, two other British colonies in Africa.

### 东非怯尼亚人  反英斗争日益激化

    东非怯尼亚人民
    反英斗争日益激化
    【新华社三十一日讯】随着北非和南非民族解放运动的发展，英属东非殖民地怯尼亚又爆发了人民反对帝国主义殖民统治的斗争。
    怯尼亚被压迫的五百多万黑种人民许久以来就不断反抗英国殖民主义者的野蛮统治和残酷剥削。近几月来，由于英国殖民当局为了保障英美资本家在怯尼亚投资的利益，进一步采取镇压民族民主运动的措施，反抗殖民地统治的斗争更加发展。在某些地区，反抗运动爆发为武装斗争。
    怯尼亚人民反殖民运动的激化，使英帝国主义统治者异常惊慌。殖民当局在十月二十日宣布戒严并进行大批逮捕。在被捕的人中间有怯尼亚非洲联盟领袖肯雅塔，殖民当局已把他解往边僻地区，以便
    “随意处置”。英国政府还从苏彝士运河区及锡兰科伦坡港调集军队，赶往镇压。
    英国的殖民统治者企图用这样一些暴力手段来压服非洲人民的反抗。但怯尼亚人民不顾英国殖民统治者的血腥镇压，仍坚决继续他们的斗争。在怯尼亚首府内罗毕散发的一封给殖民主义者的信，表现了他们的斗争决心。
    信上说：“野蛮的行动与镇压措施，武力示威和暴力统治，并不能阻止我们达到目的。你们逮捕我们的领袖，并不能熄灭我们的政治愿望……我们将要继续和你们作斗争，以获得自由。”
    怯尼亚非洲人联盟已选出新的领导机构以代替被捕的领袖，并提出了：废除一切种族歧视，给非洲人民土地，非洲人民应享有同等的选举和劳动权利，非洲劳工组织工会的自由，言论、集会和结社的自由等要求。
    怯尼亚人民的反殖民压迫斗争，得到其他非洲人民的同情。在英国的非洲人同盟执行委员会通过了一项决议，抗议英国对于正在为他们的民主权利和反对殖民地压迫而斗争的怯尼亚人民使用军队和大规模的镇压。苏彝士运河区的东非土著军队拒绝去怯尼亚进行镇压的命令，与英国军队发生冲突。
    有消息说，怯尼亚人民的这一运动，现在还向英国在非洲的另外两个殖民地乌干达和坦噶尼喀发展中。
