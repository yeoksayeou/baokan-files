    10. This autumn harvest, the Jinbaishan group overcame natural disasters and insect pests, harvesting 6,880 jin of rice per hectare. Old Man Jiang's rice harvest decreased by 400 jin per hectare.
    11. After this year, Old Man Jiang regretted not insisting on "going it alone." He said to Jinbaishan: "I'm like a woman with bound feet walking a long road, the further I walk, the tighter and more painful my feet become."
    12. The Jinbaishan group was selected as a model group. Based on this group, the government invested in building a new village and preparing to establish a collective farm. The leadership called on the masses to participate, and Jiang Dongxun also voluntarily signed up to join the collective farm.

    十、这年秋收，金白山小组战胜了天灾虫害，每垧地收获稻谷六千八百八十斤。姜老汉每垧地减收稻谷四百斤。
    十一、这年下来，姜老汉才后悔不该坚持“单干”，他向金白山说：“我这好比裹脚的婆娘走远路，越走越紧越脚疼”。
    十二、金白山小组当选为模范组，以这个小组作基础，政府投资盖新村，筹备成立集体农庄。领导上号召群众来参加，姜东勋也自愿报名加入了集体农庄。
