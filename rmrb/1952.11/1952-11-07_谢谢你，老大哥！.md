    Thank You, Big Brother!

    (I)
    In my pocket is a small notebook with a dark green cover. Every time I take it out, I always like to look at the simple design: four gold characters "Defend Peace" are embedded on the cover. Below the characters are two interlocked rings, depicting the national flags of China and the Soviet Union. In the middle of the two flags, slightly higher—a peace dove. Below the rings is a ribbon, on which is written:
    "Consolidate Sino-Soviet friendship, defend world peace!"
    This is a wonderful symbol, and this is our people's creed.
    I bought this notebook in a store I just walked into in Beijing. Today, in every city and village in China, how many similar posters, slogans, portraits, and photos... are calling for defending peace, expressing the deep feelings and boundless love of the Chinese people for the Soviet people and the great Stalin!
    …Stalin…
    His hands are higher than the sky.
    His heart is wider than the earth.
    Millions of cities and towns in the world
    Are inhabited by Stalin.
    In Stalin's heart
    Also live millions of working people.
    —Excerpt from Tian Jian's "Ode to Stalin"
    Yes, we Chinese, from the old to the young, firmly believe that the friendship, cooperation, and mutual assistance of our two great nations, totaling 700 million people, have been, are, and will continue to be the most reliable guarantee of peace in the Far East and the world.
    (II)
    Not long ago, the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference was held in Beijing. This was a powerful demonstration of more than 1.6 billion people uniting to support peace and oppose the instigators of a new world war. Representatives of the people of thirty-seven countries unanimously and resolutely demanded an immediate end to the three wars in Asia—the wars in Korea, Vietnam, and Malaya; demanded a halt to the revival of Japanese militarism fostered by the American occupation forces; demanded national independence for all countries and peoples, opposing interference by other countries in their internal affairs; and demanded free international economic and cultural exchange. They demanded peace, demanded true peace in the Pacific.
    At this conference, we heard from the representatives' speeches their confidence and expectations for the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, especially their unwavering friendship and brotherly cooperation, which they regarded as a reliable bulwark of world peace.
    The working people of all countries in the world see and realize that the balance of power between the peace, democracy, and socialism camp headed by the Soviet Union and the war and reaction camp headed by the United States is now such that: due to the strong unity of the people of the Soviet Union, China, and the people's democratic countries, the result of the new war adventures of the American imperialist aggressors will inevitably be the collapse and demise of the entire imperialism. However, if the American imperialists still dare to launch a world war, the masses of people in many countries on earth will suffer pain and disaster. Therefore, the struggle to maintain peace, suppress warmongers, and prevent a new world massacre is related to the vital interests of mankind.
    The people of the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and the people's democratic countries are firmly in favor of peace. They do not need war. The peaceful policies of these countries are inherent in and generated by their social systems. They need lasting international peace in order to build their new, peaceful, and happy lives. People all over the world also clearly see that the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and the people's democratic countries are the "vanguard" in maintaining the cause of peace, the Soviet Union is the leader of this vanguard, and is like an elder brother in a big family. Therefore, the eyes of all people naturally turn to the Soviet Union, yearning for this country that embodies the bright future of all mankind. The interests of the Soviet Union are consistent and integrated with the interests of all people who love peace and oppose imperialist aggression. Repeated experience has proven that the Soviet Union has full confidence and strength to defeat any enemy of mankind and save all mankind from enslavement. It is the most reliable friend of all peoples. People of all countries realize and feel that friendship with the Soviet Union is as necessary to them as air and sunshine.
    (III)
    The historic resolutions of the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and Stalin's brilliant work "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR," and his speech at the closing of the Congress, have been warmly applauded and wholeheartedly supported by working people in all countries of the world, especially those in the powerful camp of democracy, peace, and socialism.
    These programs for communist construction encourage all free people to build a new life, consolidate friendship with the Soviet Union, and strengthen brotherly cooperation.
    Such cooperation is only possible now. – Only when the great October Socialist Revolution triumphed in the Soviet Union (today we celebrate its 35th anniversary with special excitement), when people's democracy achieved victory in many countries, and when the people's revolution achieved victory in China, was such cooperation possible. In the struggle for peace, the Soviet Union is no longer fighting alone. "Now, from China and Korea to Czechoslovakia and Hungary" (Stalin), these many people's democratic countries are marching with it on the same road.
    Such cooperation is only possible now that the idea of ​​Marxist-Leninist proletarian internationalism has triumphed. Mao Zedong said in his article "Stalin is a Friend of the Chinese People": "The cause of liberation of the Chinese nation and the Chinese people can only be truly assisted by socialist countries, socialist leaders, socialist people, socialist thinkers, politicians, and workers; and our cause cannot achieve final victory without their assistance."
    This is a new type of international relations, a new type of mutual assistance and cooperation between people. This kind of cooperation has never existed in history and cannot exist. The Chinese people have clearly seen from their own life experiences over the past thirty years, especially in the past three years, that the sincere and selfless assistance and brotherly cooperation of the Soviet Union has greatly promoted the economic and cultural development and the growth of national strength of the People's Republic of China. The Soviet Union supplies our country with various machines, equipment, and materials urgently needed for construction. The Soviet Union conducts trade with our country on the most favorable terms and purchases our country's agricultural products and native products at the most reasonable prices, thereby increasing the income of our country's farmers and handicraftsmen and improving the living standards of the broad masses of the people. The Soviet Union also provides our country with practical assistance, dispatching a large number of experts to help us with construction and introducing to us the advanced experiences of the Soviet Union in various sectors of economic and cultural life.
    As everyone knows, the most progressive and advanced Soviet science, culture, literature, and art have had an extraordinarily great influence on the Chinese people. How many young people (and more than just young people) have determined their outlook on life and embarked on the road of revolution because they have been nurtured and influenced by Soviet literature and art! Chairman Mao said that the Chinese people initially learned Marxism from the Russians. Shouldn't we be grateful for the Soviet Union's assistance with this rich "spiritual food"?
    Without the help of the Soviet Union and the support of international workers, the Chinese people's revolution could not have been victorious. Similarly, without this assistance and support, the construction of the new China would be impossible. The Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance signed in February 1950, and the new agreement signed in September of this year, prove our two countries' joint efforts to maintain peace and security.
    Now everyone understands that in order to defend peace in the Pacific, the Far East, and the world, and in order to consolidate our country's independence and security, it is necessary to strengthen friendship and cooperation with the Soviet Union. This friendship and cooperation is especially important now. Look, aren't the American imperialist aggressors intentionally continuing and expanding the war in Korea? Aren't they stepping up the revival of Japanese militarism and German fascism? Aren't they dreaming of dominating the world, vigorously promoting various misanthropic so-called "theories" as "ideological weapons" for launching a world massacre, such as the new Malthusian population theory (which says that the reason the world is unstable now is because of overpopulation, and that the world would be peaceful when there were only 700 million people... therefore war is necessary, and the use of weapons of mass destruction is necessary...), such as "geopolitics" (which says that the United States should rule the world in terms of geographical situation, and it has the mission of being a "world policeman," and must use force to cultivate the "American way of life" all over the world, and turn the whole world into an American barracks...), such as "racism" (which says that the American race is superior to all other races, and the white race is superior to colored races), etc., etc.? In such a tense and complex time, strengthening Sino-Soviet friendship and unity is even more urgently important.
    All the attempts of the warmongers are in vain!
    The people of China and the Soviet Union, the people of the entire earth, are uniting more and more every day. Their united movement to strive for international peace and resist the instigators of a new world war is expanding and surging day by day. The World People's Peace Congress to be held this December is a manifestation of this surge. It is a manifestation of the determination of the people of all countries to take on the cause of maintaining peace and persevere to the end.
    Today, as we celebrate the 35th anniversary of the Great October Revolution together with all progressive mankind, the Chinese people think of their achievements in the three years since the great leader Chairman Mao Zedong announced in Beijing on the unforgettable October 1 that our people had begun a new century. These achievements are great!
    We are proud of this, and at the same time, we cannot help but thank the Soviet people from the bottom of our hearts for their friendly concern and brotherly help. Hundreds of millions, thousands of millions, tens of thousands of millions of Chinese people, from the old to the young, cheer to the distant but close Soviet people on this great festival: "Thank you, Big Brother!"

### 谢谢你，老大哥！

    谢谢你，老大哥！
    萧三
    （一）
    在我的口袋里有一个不大的笔记本子，深绿色的封面。每一次取出它来的时候我总喜欢看看那朴素的构图：封面上嵌着四个金字“保卫和平”。在字的下面是两个互相扣结着的环，画着中苏两国的国旗。在两面旗的中间，稍高一点—一只和平鸽子。环的下面是一根纽带，上面写着：
    “巩固中苏友好，保卫世界和平！”
    这是一个绝妙的象征，这也就是我们人民的信条。
    这个笔记本子我是在北京市上随便走进一家商店里买来的。今天在全中国的各个城市和乡村有多少这类的招贴画、标语、肖像、照片……是号召保卫和平，表示千千万万的中国人民对苏联人民和伟大斯大林的深厚的感情与无限的爱的！
    …斯大林…
    他的手比天高。
    他的心比地阔。
    世界上千万个城镇
    都住着斯大林。
    斯大林的心上
    也住着千万劳动人。
    ——录自田间的“斯大林颂”
    是的，我们中国人，从老的到小的，都坚决地相信，共计有七万万人的我们两个伟大民族的友好，合作和互助，过去是，现在是，将来仍然是远东与全世界和平的最可靠的保证。
    （二）
    不久以前在北京举行了亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议。这是十六亿以上的人们团结一致拥护和平、反对新的世界大战的煽动者的强有力的示威。三十七个国家的人民的代表们一致坚决地要求立即停止亚洲的三个战争——在朝鲜、越南、马来亚的战争；要求制止由美国占领军所扶植的日本军国主义的复活；要求一切国家与人民的民族独立，反对别国干涉本国的内政；要求国际间经济和文化的自由的交流。他们要求和平，要求太平洋上真正太平。
    在这个大会上我们从代表们的讲话里听到了他们对苏联，对中华人民共和国的信心与期望，特别是对这两个大国的牢固不破的友谊和兄弟般的合作，认为是全世界和平的可靠的堡垒。
    全世界各国的劳动者看到和觉悟到，以苏联为首的和平、民主与社会主义的阵营，和以美国为首的战争与反动的阵营，这两个阵营的力量的对比，现在是这样的：由于苏联、中国和各人民民主国家人民的强有力的团结一致，美国帝国主义侵略者新的战争冒险，其结果必然地会是整个帝国主义的垮台、灭亡。但是如果美国帝国主义者仍要冒险发动世界大战，地面上就会有许多国家的人民群众会遭受痛苦和灾难。因此，维护和平，镇压战争贩子和防止新的世界大屠杀这个斗争，是关系着人类的切身利益的。
    苏联、中华人民共和国和各人民民主国家的人民是坚决拥护和平的。他们不需要战争。这些国家的和平政策是他们的社会制度所固有的，生成的。他们需要国际持久的和平，为了建设自己新的、和平的与幸福的生活。全世界人民也明显地看见，苏联、中华人民共和国和各人民民主国家是维护和平事业的“突击队”，苏联是这个突击队中的突击队长，是一个大家庭中的老大哥。因此，一切人民的眼光，自然都向往着苏联，向往这一个体现着全人类光明的将来的国家。苏联的利益和一切爱好和平、反对帝国主义侵略战争的人民的利益是一致的和融合的。多次的经验证明，苏联有充分信心与力量去战胜任何人类的敌人，拯救全人类免于奴役。他是一切人民的最可靠的朋友。各国人民都意识到和感觉得，和苏联友好，对于他们是和空气和太阳一样的需要呵。
    （三）
    苏联共产党第十九次代表大会的具有历史意义的决议，斯大林的天才的著作“苏联社会主义经济问题”，他在代表大会闭会时的讲话，得到全世界各国的劳动者，特别是民主、和平与社会主义这个强大阵营里的劳动者的热烈的欢呼和衷心的拥护。
    这些规定共产主义建设的纲领，鼓舞着所有自由的人民去建设新的生活，巩固和苏联的友好与兄弟般的合作。
    这样的合作只有现在才是可能的。——只有当伟大的十月社会主义革命在苏联胜利了（今天我们以特别兴奋的心情庆祝它的三十五周年），当人民民主在许多国家得到了胜利，当人民革命在中国得到胜利了，才有这样合作的可能。在为和平的斗争中，苏联已经不是孤军作战了。“现在，从中国和朝鲜直到捷克斯洛伐克和匈牙利”（斯大林），这许多人民民主的国家都和它在一条道路上进军。
    这样的合作只有当马克思、列宁主义的无产阶级国际主义这个思想获得了胜利的现在，才有可能。毛泽东在他的“斯大林是中国人民的朋友”一文中说了：“中华民族和中国人民的解放事业，只有社会主义的国家，社会主义的领袖，社会主义的人民，社会主义的思想家、政治家、劳动者，才能真正援助；而我们的事业，没有他们的援助是不能取得最后胜利的。”
    这是新型的国际关系，新型的人民之间的互助和合作。这种合作是历史上不曾有过也不能有的。中国人民从过去三十多年，特别是最近三年以来自己生活的经验，明显地看见了，苏联的真诚无私的帮助和兄弟般的合作，大大地促进了中华人民共和国经济和文化的发展与国家力量的增长。苏联供给我国在建设上所急需的各种机器设备与器材。苏联以最优惠的条件与我国进行贸易，以最合理的价格收购我国的农业品和土产，因而使我国农民和手工业者的收入增加，广大人民群众的生活水平提高。苏联还给我国以切实的帮助，派遣大批专家来帮助我们建设，介绍苏联在经济与文化生活各个部门的先进的经验给我们。
    如大家所知道的，最进步最先进的苏联的科学、文化、文学、艺术对中国人民的影响是异常巨大的。多少青年人（不止于青年）因为受了苏联文艺的薰陶和影响而确定自己的人生观，走到革命的道上来了！毛主席说过，中国人最初是从俄国人那里学到马克思主义的。我们对苏联这份丰富的“精神食粮”的帮助，能不感激吗？
    没有苏联的帮助和国际劳动者的支持，中国的人民革命是不能取得胜利的。同样，没有这个援助与支持，新中国的建设也是不可能的。一九五一年二月订立的中苏友好同盟互助条约，和今年九月签定的新的协议，证明我们两国为维护和平与安全而奋斗的共同的努力。
    现在谁都明白，为了保卫太平洋、远东及全世界的和平，为了巩固我国的独立与安全，需要加强与苏联的友好和合作。这个友好与合作，特别在现在最重要。你看，美帝国主义侵略者不是有意继续和扩大在朝鲜的战争么？他们不是正在加紧日本军国主义与德国法西斯主义的复活么？他们不是正在作统治全世界的梦，极力宣传各种仇视人类的所谓“理论”，作为掀起世界大屠杀的“思想武器”，如新的马尔萨斯人口论（即是说什么现在世界不安，就由于人口过多，全世界只有七万万人的时候就会太平……因此战争是必要的，使用大量杀人的武器是必要的……），如“地理政治”（即是说什么美国在地理形势上应该统治全世界，它有当“世界宪兵”的使命，必需用武力在全世界栽培“美国生活方式”，把全世界变为美国兵营……）如“种族主义”
    （即是说什么美国人种优于一切别的人种，白种人优于有色人种）等等等等么？在这样紧张复杂的时候，加强中苏友好团结，就更加具有非常迫切的意义了。
    战争贩子的一切企图都是枉然的！
    中国和苏联的人民，全地球上的人民都一天天地更加团结起来了。他们团结一致，争取国际和平，反抗新的世界大战的煽动者的运动一天天扩大、高涨起来了。本年十二月即将举行的世界人民和平大会就是这个高涨的表现。就是各国人民要把维护和平的事业担当起来，并且坚持到底的决心的表现。
    在和全体进步人类一同庆祝伟大十月革命的三十五周年的今天，中国人民想到他自己在伟大领袖毛泽东主席于难忘的十月一日在北京宣布我国人民开始了新的世纪之后，这三年以来的成就。这些成就是伟大的！
    我们以此自豪，同时我们不能不从心底深处感谢苏维埃人对我们的友谊的关怀和兄弟般的帮助。成百万、千万、万万的中国人，从老的到小的，在这个伟大的节日向遥远而又亲近的苏联人欢呼：“谢谢你，老大哥！”
