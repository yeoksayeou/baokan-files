    The Soviet Medical Education Expert Bykov, Forever Missed by the Chinese People
    Min Zeng
    On June 14, 1952, in a hospital in Moscow, Comrade F.S. Bykov, a Soviet medical education expert forever missed by the Chinese people, passed away.

    F.S. Bykov joined the Soviet Communist Party in 1919 and was an old cadre in the Soviet healthcare organization and training of medical personnel. He was a candidate of medical sciences in the Soviet Union. He devoted his life to healthcare and had many years of research achievements and work experience, especially in medical education. For his contributions to Soviet people's health construction, he was awarded the Soviet Red Star Medal. During the Great Patriotic War of the Soviet Union, he participated with unparalleled patriotic enthusiasm. In this war, he contributed all his strength and knowledge for the happiness of the motherland, and therefore gloriously won the Second Class Medal of the Patriotic War and medals.

    From the first day he came to China, Bykov took on the glorious task of introducing the Soviet Union's advanced healthcare system and medical experience. He devoted most of his energy to helping reform China's medical education system. Based on the rich experience of socialist health construction in the Soviet Union and China's specific conditions, he provided many valuable opinions on the specific measures for the restoration and development of China's health cause and the improvement of the medical education system.

    In order to understand the basic situation of Chinese medical colleges, he visited the Northeast China Medical University, Harbin Medical University, and Dalian Medical College, and also inspected every medical college in Shanghai and Hangzhou. After careful investigation and research, and after spending half a year and going through many discussions and five or six revisions, the Ministry of Health of the Central Government, with his specific assistance, finally compiled a unified teaching curriculum for nine departments of medical colleges, including internal medicine, surgery, pediatrics, obstetrics and gynecology, public health, stomatology, ophthalmology, dermatology and venereology, otolaryngology, as well as medical assistant schools, nursing schools, and midwifery schools.

    In November 1951, the Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government held a senior health cadre training class. This training class was started on Bykov's suggestion. The trainees were health cadres on the job from all over the country. Comrade Bykov served as the main lecturer of this class.

    After 45 days of study and 14 major reports by Soviet experts, this class helped the trainees understand why they should study and how to study. Wang Yuxian, deputy director of the Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau, said after the study: "After this study, I further realized the advanced nature of Soviet health work. Only in a socialist social system can the people's health be guaranteed to the greatest extent..." These trainees—originally senior leaders of the health department—took the advanced experience of Soviet health care work they had learned in this study back to their posts, conveyed it to the vast number of health workers they led, and laid the foundation for health workers across the country to learn from the Soviet Union.

    The Soviet expert Bykov, who came from a socialist country, not only had rich knowledge and experience, but also had a high degree of internationalism and the fine work style of a Communist Party member: serious, responsible, hardworking, and simple. During his year or so in China, he rarely spent Sundays idle—he also contributed this day off to the Chinese people, working for the construction of the Chinese people's health cause. On ordinary days, after returning to his dormitory from the office, he often read books, wrote reports, and looked at documents until late at night. After the senior health cadre training class started, he rarely went to bed before twelve o'clock every night. During the day, he had to stand and give a report for four or five hours; at night, he had to prepare materials, write lecture notes, and write outlines, answering all the questions raised by the trainees in detail. "Doing this work is very useful for the Chinese people." He never showed any sign of fatigue. He often said: "The time to come to China is very short, and there are many things to do. There should be no time for rest. I must seize the time to work."

    Hangzhou is a famous scenic spot in China and the world. People who come here always want to see the scenic West Lake first. The day after Bykov arrived in Hangzhou, everyone invited him to see the scenery. At that time, he refused without hesitation. "We are here to work. We should not put aside our work to go sightseeing first." It was not until the work was completed and on the eve of leaving Hangzhou that he happily toured the scenic spots of Hangzhou on Sunday.

    In mid-February 1952, he caught a cold and felt dizzy. Others advised him to rest, but he still insisted on working. Later, his condition worsened slightly, and he lay in the dormitory, and his heart disease recurred. He was only willing to move into the hospital on the 24th.

    On March 1, leading comrades from the Ministry of Health went to see him. In the hospital bed, he said happily in simple Chinese: "Thank you!" He believed that his illness would get better in a few days. He talked about a medical history during the Soviet Patriotic War: he had a very serious illness, and the doctor said that he was going to die, so prepare for the funeral quickly. But he had the confidence to overcome death. Finally, thanks to the patient care of the hospital and the care of his wife, Comrade Bykova, he recovered and was discharged from the hospital. This time, he said with the same confidence: "In a few days, I can go back to the Ministry of Health to work."

    However, the development of the disease did not go as planned, and it deteriorated day by day. In addition to the original heart disease, he also suffered from hemiplegia, and could not eat, but could only be fed milk through his nostrils. In the past, his mouth, which liked to tell stories, could not move his lips or tongue now, and he could only say a simple Russian "yes" or "no".

    His wife, Bykova, rushed from Moscow to see him. Although he did not agree to Bykova coming to China, her arrival immediately improved his condition. Bykova asked him:

    "Let's send you back to Moscow to recuperate!"

    He shook his head without hesitation.

    "Don't you want to leave China?"

    "Yes," he nodded, saying the only word he could say.

    Comrades from the Ministry of Health also persuaded him to go back to Moscow to recuperate. He also shook his head. He firmly believed that he could recover in China and continue working.

    During the painful and lonely days in the hospital bed, he did not think about his illness or his life; what he always thought about was the current major political events and the work he had to do. He gestured to ask the translator to read the newspaper to him. The translator found a title of a film review to read to him, and he shook his head to indicate that he did not want to listen. He pointed his finger in the direction of the Northeast, and the translator understood that he wanted to know about the Korean battlefield. When he heard the news that the United States was undermining the armistice negotiations and conducting heinous bacteriological warfare in Korea and Northeast China, extreme anger immediately appeared on his pale face.

    Comrades came to see him, and he used his hands, lips, and eyes to ask others to talk to him. "Do you want to know about my own life?" He shook his head. "Do you want to know about the situation of Soviet experts in Beijing?" He still shook his head. "Do you want to hear about the work of the Ministry of Health?" He labored to say the word "yes." He closed his eyes and listened quietly to the speech on the progress of the work of the Ministry of Health. When he heard that the teaching plan of medical colleges and universities that he had personally helped to draft had been announced and implemented in colleges and universities across the country, he was extremely happy, and a smiling light appeared in his eyes, and several smile lines appeared on the corners of his already crooked mouth.

    Su Jingguan, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Health of the Central Government, personally went to see him, advised him to go back to Moscow to recuperate, and told him to come to China again after he recovered. Bykova also told him several times: "Go back to Moscow and recuperate with peace of mind! The Chinese people need you. When you get well, you can come to China to do more things." Finally, he agreed to return to Moscow.

    However, unfortunately, Bykov's illness was incurable. He passed away only four days after returning to the Soviet Union.

    The Chinese people will always remember Bykov's name, his work, and his spirit of internationalism, which will always live in the hearts of the Chinese people.

    永远为中国人民怀念的苏联医学教育专家比阔夫
    敏增
    一九五二年六月十四日，在莫斯科某医院里，一位永远为中国人民怀念的苏联医学教育专家佛·斯·比阔夫同志逝世了。
    佛·斯·比阔夫是一九五一年一月由莫斯科来中国帮助卫生建设的苏联专家之一。一年多来，他对中国人民卫生事业作了极大的贡献。
    比阔夫是从一九一九年即加入苏联共产党的，是苏维埃卫生保健组织与培养医务人材的老干部，是苏联医学候补博士。他毕生从事于卫生事业，特别对医学教育有着多年的研究成绩和工作经验。由于他对苏联人民卫生建设的贡献，曾经荣膺苏联红星勋章。伟大的苏联卫国战争时期，他以无比的爱国热情参加了。在这一战争中，为了祖国的幸福，他贡献出自己的全部力量和知识，因此光荣地获得了卫国战争二级勋章与奖章。
    比阔夫从来到中国的第一天起，就担负起了介绍苏联先进卫生保健制度和医学经验的光荣任务。他以大部分的精力从事了帮助改革中国医学教育制度的工作。根据苏联社会主义卫生建设的丰富经验和中国的具体情况，他对中国卫生事业的恢复发展及医学教育制度改进的具体措施上提供了许多宝贵的意见。
    为了解中国医学院校的基本情况，他访问了东北中国医科大学，到过哈尔滨医科大学和大连医学院，也考察了上海、杭州每个医学院校。通过缜密的调查研究以后，花费了半年的时间，经过多次的讨论，五六次的修改，终于，中央卫生部在他的具体协助下编制出了医学院中内科、外科、小儿科、妇产科、公共卫生、口腔、眼科、皮花科、耳鼻喉科等九个学系及医士学校、护士学校、助产学校的统一的教学课程表。
    一九五一年十一月，中央人民政府卫生部举办了一个高级卫生干部训练班。这个训练班是在比阔夫建议之下开办的。学员是由全国各地在职的卫生干部调来学习的。比阔夫同志担任了这个班的主讲。
    这个班，经过四十五天的学习，十四次苏联专家的大报告，使学员们懂得了为什么学习和怎样学习。上海市卫生局副局长王聿先在学习后说：“经过这次学习，使我进一步认识了苏联卫生工作的先进性。只有在社会主义的社会制度里，人民健康才能获得最大的保障……”这些学员们——原是卫生部门高级领导干部，他们都把在这次学习中所学习到的苏联卫生保健工作先进经验带到他们的岗位上去了，传达给他们所领导的广大卫生人员，扎下全国卫生人员向苏联学习的基础。
    ××××××
    来自社会主义国家的苏联专家比阔夫，他不仅具有丰富的学识和经验，更有高度的国际主义精神和共产党员的认真负责坚苦朴实的优良作风。来中国一年多，他很少空闲地度过星期日——这个自己的假日也贡献给了中国人民，为建设中国人民的卫生事业工作着。平常日子，从办公室回到宿舍后，他还经常翻阅书籍、写报告、看文件一直到深夜。高级卫生干部训练班开班以后，他每晚在十二点以前睡觉是很少的。白天，一个报告就要站着讲四、五个小时；夜里，他要准备材料写讲义，写提纲，为学员们详细解答提出来的所有问题。“做好这件工作，对中国人民是很有用的。”他从来没有一点劳累的表示。他经常说：“来中国的时间很短，要做的事很多，不应该有休息的时间，我要抓紧时间工作。”
    杭州是中国和世界出名的风景区，人们来到这里总会先要去看看西湖名胜。比阔夫到了杭州的第二天，大家邀他去看风景。当时，他毫不迟疑地拒绝了。“我们是来工作的，不应该先放下工作去游山逛水。”直到工作完毕，离开杭州的前夕，他才利用星期日畅快地观览了杭州名胜。
    一九五二年二月中旬，他患感冒，头晕。别人劝他休息，他仍然坚持工作。后来病情稍重，躺在宿舍里，心脏病复发了。二十四日才愿搬进医院。
    三月一日，卫生部负责同志去看他，他在病床上很高兴地用简单的中国话说：“谢谢！”他相信他的病过几天一定会好。他讲起了他在苏联卫国战争时期的一段病史：他得过很严重的病，医生说他要死了，赶紧准备后事吧。但是他有信心能够战胜死亡。终于，由于医院的耐心护理和他爱人比阔娃同志的看顾而痊愈出院了。这次他抱着同样的信心说：“过几天我就可以回到卫生部去工作了。”
    然而，病情的发展不随人愿，一天天地恶化了。除了原来的心脏病，又得了半身不遂，不能吃饭了，只能从鼻孔里灌牛奶。往日他那张喜欢讲故事的嘴，现在，嘴唇、舌头都不能动了，只会说一句简单的俄语“是”或“不”。
    他的爱人比阔娃从莫斯科赶来看他。虽然他不同意比阔娃来中国，但是她来了，使他的病情立即有些好转。比阔娃问他：
    “送你回莫斯科去休养吧！”
    他毫不考虑的摇了摇头。
    “你不要离开中国吗？”
    “是”，他点点头，说出了他只能说的一个字。
    卫生部的同志也劝他回莫斯科去休养，他同样的摇摇头。他坚信能够在中国养好，可以继续工作。
    在病床上过着痛苦寂寞的日子里，他没有想到他的病，他的生命；他时时想念的是当前重大政治事件和他所要做的工作。他以手表示要求翻译读报纸给他听。翻译找了一篇电影评介的题目读给他，他摇摇头表示不要听。他用手指指东北的方向，翻译会意了他是要知道朝鲜战场的事情。当他听到美国破坏停战谈判和在朝鲜及我国东北进行罪恶的细菌战的消息，苍白的脸上立即表露出极度的愤怒。
    同志们来看他，他用手、用嘴唇、用眼睛表示要求别人向他讲话。“你是要知道我自己的生活吗？”他摇头。“你是要知道北京苏联专家的情况吗？”他仍然摇头。“你是不是要听听卫生部的工作呀？”他吃力的说了一个字“是”。他闭着眼静静地听着卫生部工作进展的讲话。当他听到他亲手协助草拟的医学院校教学计划已经公布并在各地院校实施了的时候，他高兴极了，眼睛里发出微笑的光彩，一张已经歪了的嘴，嘴角上裂出了几条笑纹。
    中央卫生部苏井观副部长亲自去看他，劝他回莫斯科去休养，并告诉他病好了再来中国。比阔娃也几次的向他讲：“回莫斯科安心地去休养吧！中国人民需要你，病好了，还可以来中国做更多的事情。”最后，他答应回莫斯科了。
    然而，很不幸，比阔夫的病已不治了。回到苏联仅仅四天，就与世长辞了。
    中国人民将永远记着比阔夫的名字，他的工作，他的国际主义精神，将永远在中国人民的心中活着。
