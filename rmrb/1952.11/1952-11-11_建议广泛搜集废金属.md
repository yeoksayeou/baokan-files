    Suggestion for a Broad Collection of Scrap Metal
    To the Editor: Steel is an important raw material for our country's economic and national defense construction, but at present, many places have a lot of scrap steel, iron and other metals that are left unattended, and many are even oxidized or corroded. In order to prevent this kind of waste, we suggest that a mass scrap metal collection movement be launched nationwide recently to collect all scrap metal from various agencies, organizations, and citizens, and have the government designate certain agencies to take charge of collection and disposal.

    建议广泛搜集废金属
    编辑同志：钢铁是我国经济建设和国防建设的重要原料，但是，目前有些地方却放置着很多钢、铁和其他金属的废品无人过问，也有不少竟被氧化或腐烂了。为杜绝这种浪费现象，我们建议最近在全国范围内，展开一个群众性的搜集废金属运动，把各机关、团体、市民中的废金属，全部搜集起来，由政府指定一定的机关收管处理。
