To the Editor: We, the teachers and students of Beijing Agricultural University, celebrate the 35th anniversary of the October Revolution with immense joy and excitement. For thirty-five years, the victorious Soviet people have always been the closest friends and mentors of the Chinese people; the selfless assistance of the Soviet people has enabled us to overcome all difficulties. In our school, the enthusiastic and tireless teachings of Professor Suezina from Moscow have clarified the direction of biological science for us and laid the theoretical foundation of Darwinism. Soviet expert Ivanov helped us reform the agricultural education system, creating favorable conditions for training agricultural construction cadres in the future. They constantly teach us: "We must transform nature, and the man-made can and will be better than nature." "The motherland is strength, and the motherland is the infinite source of our strength." They encourage us with Michurin's spirit of persistent work and pursuit of truth. To welcome the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month," we must strive to learn advanced Michurin biological science and the Soviet experts' spirit of loving science and the people. We understand that only through hard work and persistent learning can we master Michurin biological science, create high-quality new varieties, make every corner of the motherland grow abundant fruit trees and crops, and bloom with flowers, change the face of nature, and seek greater happiness for the working people.

We must learn Russian well, and even more so, we must learn Soviet biological science. Currently, hundreds of teachers and students in the school are learning Russian. For example, more than 90% of the students in the Department of Veterinary Medicine are learning Russian, and more than 40 students in the school have graduated from the first Russian language intensive training class. We will welcome the great construction of the motherland by learning Russian well and learning advanced Michurin biological science.

    北京农业大学全体师生努力学习苏联先进生物科学
    编辑同志：我们北京农业大学的师生以无比欢欣鼓舞的心情来庆贺十月革命三十五周年纪念日。三十五年来，胜利了的苏联人民始终是中国人民最亲密的朋友和导师；苏联人民对我们无私的援助使我们战胜了一切困难。在我们学校里，从莫斯科来的绥吉纳教授热情不倦的教诲，使我们明确了生物科学的方向，打下了达尔文主义的理论基础。苏联专家伊凡诺夫帮助我们进行农业教育制度的改革，为今后培养农业建设干部创造了有利的条件。他们不断地教育我们：“我们要改造自然，人为的能够而且一定会比自然更好。”“祖国就是力量，祖国是我们力量的无限源泉。”他们以米丘林顽强工作、追求真理的精神鼓舞我们。迎接“中苏友好月”，我们要努力学习先进的米丘林生物科学，学习苏联专家热爱科学、热爱人民的精神。我们懂得：只有刻苦努力，坚持不懈地学习，才能掌握米丘林生物科学，创造出品质优良的新品种，使祖国的每一角落都生长起丰产的果树作物并开遍鲜花，改变自然界的面貌，为劳动人民谋更大的幸福。
    我们要学好俄文，更要学习苏联的生物科学。现在全校已有几百个教师和同学在学习俄文，如兽医系就有百分之九十以上的同学学习俄文，全校已有四十多个同学在第一届俄文专业速成学习班毕业了。我们将以学好俄文，学好先进的米丘林生物科学来迎接祖国的伟大建设。
