    We Studied the Soviet "Rapid Overhaul Method"
    Comrade Editor:
    The Zhenyang Power Plant in Yangzhou, Northern Jiangsu, has been diligently studying advanced Soviet experiences for the past three years, leading to rapid development in production. The electricity sales of the Zhenyang Power Plant have increased twentyfold compared to before liberation, and various workshops have consistently set new records. The repair workshop studied the Soviet "Rapid Overhaul Method" in September this year and overhauled Boiler No. 1 in just three days, reducing the time by half compared to the past, while also improving the quality.

    我们学习了苏联“快速检修法”
    编辑同志：苏北扬州市振扬电厂三年来努力学习苏联先进经验，使生产得到很快的发展。振扬电厂的售电量，已比解放前增加了二十倍，各个工场也都不断地创造了新纪录。修配工场今年九月学习了苏联的“快速检修法”，大修一号锅炉，只用了三天时间，较以前减少了二分之一的时间，质量还比以前好。
