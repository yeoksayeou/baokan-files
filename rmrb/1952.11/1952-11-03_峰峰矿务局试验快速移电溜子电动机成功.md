    Fengfeng Mining Bureau Successfully Tests Rapidly Moving Electric Coal Conveyor Motor

    Comrade Editor: The Fengfeng Mining Bureau's No. 2 Mine has successfully tested a rapidly moving electric coal conveyor motor. Test results show that the efficiency of moving a 15-horsepower motor has increased sixty times, and the efficiency of moving a 20-horsepower motor has increased one hundred and twenty times.

    Previously, in this mine, moving a 15-horsepower motor, even if the floorboards were smooth and laid with railway tracks, would take eight people at least half an hour. If the floorboards were bad and the tracks uneven, it would take more than an hour. For a 20-horsepower motor, it would require sixteen people, which was not only more strenuous, but also might not be completed in an hour and a half.

    In August of this year, the mine's electromechanical department, drawing on the experience of Shandong Hongshan Coal Mine, and with the help of technician Guo Tongchang from the Mining Bureau, began experimenting with rapid movement in the No. 201 mining face. The first time failed because the preparatory work was not done well and the tools were not up to standard. The second time, in the No. 202 mining face, the preparatory work was still insufficient, but the tools were better, and it took twenty minutes to complete the move. The third time, due to thorough preparation and more standardized tools, several consecutive tests showed that whether it was a 15-horsepower or 20-horsepower electric coal conveyor motor, two people could move it in just two minutes.

    The method for rapidly moving the electric coal conveyor motor is as follows: use a steel wire rope, one end hooked to the lower part of a fixed point, and the other end passed through a pulley wrapped around the motor's chain wheel. When moving, simply turn on the switch, and the steel wire rope gradually winds around the chain wheel, using the motor's own power to drive the body forward, and it can be moved quickly.

    峰峰矿务局试验快速移电溜子电动机成功
    编辑同志：峰峰矿务局二矿试验快速移电溜子电动机已经成功。试验结果移十五马力的电动机效率提高六十倍，移二十马力的电动机提高效率一百二十倍。
    从前，这个矿移一部十五马力的电动机，若底板很光，再铺上铁道，八个人最少要移半小时，若底板不好，道不平，花一小时也移不完。要是二十马力的，就得十六个人，不但更费劲，一小时半也未必移完。
    今年八月，该矿机电股吸取了山东洪山煤矿的经验，在矿务局技术员郭同昌的帮助下，开始在二○一掌子面试验快速移切。第一次因准备工作未做好，工具不合规格，结果失败了。第二次在二○二掌子面试验，准备工作仍是不够，但工具较好些，结果二十分钟移完。第三次由于作了充分的准备工作，工具也比较正规化了，接连试验几次，不论是十五马力或二十马力的电溜子电动机，都是两个人用两分钟时间就可以移完。
    快速移电溜子电动机的方法是：用钢丝绳一根，一端挂在一个固定点子的下部，另一端通过一个滑轮缠在电动机的链子轮上，移动时，只把电门一开，钢丝绳就逐渐向链子轮缠绕，以电动机本身的力量带动机身前进，很快就可移好。    杨亚东
