Sino-Soviet Friendship Changes the Course of History
Vice-Chairman of the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, Mao Dun

The Sino-Soviet Friendship Association Headquarters has decided to hold "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month" nationwide starting from November 7th. Because this year, November 7th is the 35th anniversary of the Soviet October Socialist Revolution, our holding of "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month" serves both to warmly celebrate this great festival and to universally and deeply educate the people across the country about the prospects of socialism and communism using the great achievements of Soviet socialist construction, further developing and consolidating the friendship between the peoples of China and the Soviet Union. Therefore, the holding of this "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month" is of extremely great significance.

The Soviet October Socialist Revolution opened a new page in human history and laid the foundation for the victory of the people of the whole world. Taking our China as an example, the victory of our revolution is inseparable from the victory of the Soviet October Socialist Revolution and the brilliant achievements of Soviet socialist construction. The October Socialist Revolution brought us Marxism-Leninism and pointed out the path of the Chinese revolution. In the course of our revolutionary struggle, the Soviet people have always unswervingly given us unlimited sympathy and support. As our revolution has already achieved victory and is now in the stage of economic and cultural construction, the Soviet people are helping us with our construction with a selfless spirit. The Soviet Union is our good teacher and helpful friend – this is not an empty phrase, but is proven by countless facts.

If we calculate, the speed we have shown in restoring and developing our economy in the three years since the founding of the country, and the great achievements we have made in construction undertakings such as industry, agriculture, water conservancy, and railways, culture and education, etc., are not only unprecedented in our country's history, but also unparalleled in world history except for the Soviet Union. Such great achievements in such a short period of time are mainly due to the correct leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party and the efforts of the people across the country, but one of the important factors in being able to achieve "twice the result with half the effort" is the Soviet people's selfless assistance and our earnest learning of the Soviet Union's advanced experience. The Soviet Union went through some detours in its construction process, and now it teaches us valuable experience, so that we do not take detours. Such a selfless teacher, who holds nothing back, fully demonstrates the internationalist spirit of the Soviet people under the guidance of the great Stalin. If we have such a good teacher and do not study earnestly and humbly, then we are letting down the people, letting down Chairman Mao, and letting down the teacher.

The path that the Soviet people have taken is also the path that the Chinese people will take – this true statement has increasingly greater practical significance day by day. In the past three years, various delegations who have visited the Soviet Union have personally experienced this. The facts are before our eyes: the Soviet social and economic system, and Soviet science and technology, have surpassed and overcome those of capitalist countries, and the lives of the Soviet people are vastly different from the lives of the people in capitalist countries. The path we take, the path taken by the Soviet Union, is the path to freedom, prosperity, and happiness – this has now become an unshakeable goal. Having seen the example of the Soviet Union, can our confidence in building our motherland and moving from new democracy to socialism not be strengthened a hundredfold? To strengthen such confidence in the people across the country, and to make them understand the future of their country and the long-term prospects of their lives, the best way is to make the situation of the Soviet Union in all aspects known to everyone in the country, just like knowing the affairs of their neighbor's family. Therefore, we must let the people across the country understand and be familiar with the situation of our great neighbor, the Soviet Union. It is not only because we should understand and be familiar with each other since we are neighbors and since the people of the two countries have an unbreakable friendship, but also because this great neighbor is illuminating the road to our future – the Soviet Union's today is our tomorrow!

Sino-Soviet friendship is an important factor in safeguarding peace in Asia and peace in the world. The world is now divided into an aggressive camp and a peaceful camp. The imperialist aggressive camp is led by US imperialism, and the peace camp is led by the Soviet Union, including China, the various people's democratic countries, and the broad masses of people engaged in the peace movement in capitalist countries. This peaceful and democratic camp led by the Soviet Union, not counting the masses of the peace movement in capitalist countries, but only counting the countries that have established people's power, has a region that stretches from the Alps and the Elbe Valley in the west to the Pacific Ocean in the east, spanning Europe and Asia, with more than 800 million people. China and the Soviet Union, judging from their population, resources, etc., are important pillars in this fraternal democratic peace camp. Therefore, it is not an exaggeration to say that Sino-Soviet friendship has changed the course of history (in the words of the famous Soviet writer Ehrenburg). The Sino-Soviet Friendship Alliance protects our newly established country, preventing US imperialism from launching a major war of aggression against China, preventing it from expanding its war of aggression against Korea, and at the same time consolidating and strengthening the peace and democracy camp, and curbing the evil attempt of the imperialist aggressive bloc headed by US imperialism to immediately launch a third world war. Imperialism will not give up until it is at the point of death. Imperialism also knows that Sino-Soviet friendship is the most important factor in safeguarding peace and preventing aggression, so imperialism is trying its best to alienate our friendly relations with the Soviet Union. Imperialism has exhausted its tricks of provocation, alienation, rumor-mongering, and slander, but they have also gone bankrupt, but they have not given up. The best answer to this conspiracy of imperialism is to further consolidate and develop the friendship between China and the Soviet Union. On our part, it is to make the people across the country deeply aware of the opposition between the peace and aggression camps in the world, and to recognize the extreme importance of Sino-Soviet friendship for protecting peace in Asia and the world, that is, to recognize the importance of Sino-Soviet friendship from a global perspective and its contribution to mankind.

The imperialist aggressive bloc has internal contradictions - the most tyrannical US imperialism, which regards itself as the overlord, has contradictions with its little partners such as British and French imperialism; and there are naturally greater contradictions between the various imperialist countries and their affiliated countries and colonies, and even with the oppressed and exploited peace-loving masses of people within their own countries. These contradictions cannot be overcome, and are developing day by day; and when the strength of the peace camp is consolidated and developed day by day, the contradictions within the imperialist aggressive camp will inevitably become increasingly acute, to the point of rupture. The development and consolidation of Sino-Soviet friendship is the development and consolidation of the strength of the world peace camp, and therefore is also a decisive factor in promoting the process of the collapse of imperialism.

The above brief description is the great educational significance of "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month" for our people. Let us greet this great movement of historical significance with the greatest enthusiasm!

    中苏友好改变了历史的行程
    中华全国文学艺术界联合会副主席  茅盾
    中苏友好协会总会决定从十一月七日起，在全国范围内举行“中苏友好月”。因为今年十一月七日是苏联十月社会主义革命三十五周年的纪念日，我们举行“中苏友好月”，一来是热烈地庆祝这个伟大的节日，二来是用苏联社会主义建设的伟大成就，在全国人民群众中普遍而深入地进行有关社会主义和共产主义前途的教育，进一步发展与巩固中苏两国人民的友谊。所以，这个“中苏友好月”的举行，是有极重大的意义的。
    苏联十月社会主义革命揭开了人类历史上新的一页，奠定了全世界人民胜利的局面。拿我们中国来说，我们革命的胜利是和苏联十月社会主义革命的胜利以及苏联社会主义建设的辉煌成就，分不开的。十月社会主义革命给我们送来了马克思列宁主义，指出了中国革命的道路。在我们革命斗争的过程中，苏联人民始终不渝地给我们无限的同情与支援。当我们革命已经取得胜利而进行经济、文化建设的现阶段，苏联人民更以大公无私的精神来帮助我们进行建设。苏联是我们的良师益友，——这不是一句空话，而是由无数事实证明了的。
    我们算一算，建国三年来，我们在恢复并发展我们的经济上所表现的速度，在工业、农业、水利、铁道、文教等等建设事业上所取得的巨大成就，不但在我国历史上是空前的，即在世界历史上也是除了苏联以外还没有比并的。这样短时间内这样巨大的成就，主要地固然因为我们有毛主席和共产党的正确领导以及全国人民的努力，但所以能这样“事半而功倍”，重要因素之一是苏联人民的大公无私的援助，是我们认真地学习着苏联的先进经验。苏联在它建设过程中，是走过一些冤枉路的，现在它把宝贵的经验教给我们，使得我们不走冤枉路。这样大公无私，不留一手的先生，充分表现了在伟大的斯大林教导下的苏联人民的国际主义的精神。我们有了这样的好先生，如果还不认真地、虚心地学习，那就对不起人民，对不起毛主席，也对不起先生。
    苏联人民走过的道路，也就是中国人民所要走的路——这一句真理的话，现在是一天比一天具有越来越大的现实的意义了。三年来，我们到苏联去参观的各种代表团亲自体验到这一点。事实摆在面前，苏联的社会经济制度，苏联的科学和技术，都是超过了、胜过了资本主义国家的，苏联人民的生活比起资本主义国家的人民生活来，真有天渊之别。我们走苏联所走的道路，就是到达自由、繁荣、幸福的道路——这在现今，已成为确切不移的目标的了。看了苏联的榜样，我们的建设祖国，并由新民主主义走向社会主义的信心，还能不百倍地加强么？要使得全国人民都加强这样的信心，都能明白自己的国家的前途和自己生活的远景，最好的方法是把苏联的各方面的状况使全国人人都知道得明明白白，就像知道他的邻居家里的事一样。所以，我们要把我们这个伟大的邻居——苏联的情况让我们全国人民都了解而熟悉。还不仅是因为既然是邻居、既然两国人民有了牢不可破的友谊，就应该了解和熟悉，而且还因为这个伟大的邻居是照明了我们未来的道路的——苏联的今天就是我们的明天！
    中苏友谊是保卫亚洲和平以及世界和平的重要因素。世界现在分为侵略阵营与和平阵营。帝国主义的侵略阵营以美帝国主义为首，和平阵营则是以苏联为首的包括中国、各人民民主国家，还有资本主义国家内的从事和平运动的广大人民。这一个以苏联为首的和平民主阵营，如果不计入资本主义国家的和平运动的群众，而单以成立人民政权的国家来计算，那么，其地区，西起阿尔卑斯山与易比河谷，东至于太平洋，跨欧亚两洲，有八亿以上的人民。我们中国和苏联从人口、资源等等看来，是这兄弟般的民主的和平阵营内的重要支柱。所以说中苏友谊改变了历史的行程（苏联著名作家爱伦堡的话），并不是夸张的说法。中苏友好同盟保障了我们新成立的国家，使得美帝国主义不敢发动侵略中国的大战，使它不敢扩大侵略朝鲜的战争，同时亦巩固并加强了和平、民主阵营，遏制了以美帝国主义为首的帝国主义侵略集团立即发动第三次世界大战的罪恶企图。帝国主义是不到黄河心不死的，帝国主义也知道中苏友好是保障和平、制止侵略的最重要的因素，因而帝国主义是千方百计想来离间我们和苏联的友好关系的；帝国主义挑拨离间、造谣诽谤的伎俩是用尽了，也破产了，不过它们还没有死心。对于帝国主义这种阴谋的最好的答复就是更加巩固并发展中、苏两国的友谊。在我们这方面说来，是使得全国人民都能深切地认识世界上和平与侵略阵营的对立，认识中苏友谊对于保护亚洲与世界和平的极端重要性，也就是从世界范围来认识中苏友好的重要性及其对于人类的贡献。
    帝国主义侵略集团是有内部矛盾的，——最横暴而自居为霸主的美帝国主义和它的小伙伴如英、法帝国主义，是有矛盾的；各帝国主义国家和它们的附属国与殖民地乃至和它们本国内的被压迫被剥削的爱和平的人民大众，自然有更大的矛盾。这种矛盾是不能克服的，并且是在日益发展；而当和平阵营的力量一天一天巩固和发展的时候，帝国主义侵略阵营内部的矛盾就不可避免地会日益尖锐，以至破裂，中苏友谊的发展与巩固既是世界和平阵营力量的发展与巩固，因而也就是促进帝国主义崩溃过程的决定性的因素。
    以上的简略叙述，就是“中苏友好月”对于我国人民的巨大的教育意义。让我们以最大的热忱来迎接这个具有历史意义的伟大的运动！
