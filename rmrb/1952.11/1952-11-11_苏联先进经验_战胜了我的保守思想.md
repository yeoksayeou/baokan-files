    Soviet Advanced Experience
    Overcame My Conservative Thinking
    Comrade Editor: I am now a fourteen-year veteran as a railway signal and communication foreman. Before the promotion of Soviet advanced experience on the Sino-Soviet Railway in 1950, the work at the Yabuloni Signal and Communication Station was very chaotic. At that time, the workers in charge of communication and signaling had no work plan. They blindly ran to various stations to check the work, sometimes so busy that they didn't even have time to eat, but the work was not done well. At the same time, because we did not summarize the work, the technical level of the workers could not be improved. Therefore, an average of three or four accidents occurred every month. Since the establishment of the Sino-Soviet Railway, the Soviet Union has sent a large number of experts to help us manage the railway and promote the advanced Soviet work methods. Initially, I did not realize that promoting advanced experience was the basic method to complete various tasks. I always felt that the new experience was not as easy to use as the old way. The new methods required filling out this form and that report, which was troublesome and a waste of time. Therefore, I adopted a passive attitude towards promoting advanced experience and was unwilling to learn. Later, through the education of the Party, and the promotional achievements of other places, especially the patient help of my respected teacher, Comrade Gorasnabira from the Soviet Union, I overcame my conservative thinking. Every time I went to the section for a meeting, he would actively help me make a study plan and enthusiastically teach me. Now I have learned six advanced work methods such as "Major and Medium Repairs," "Daily Maintenance Method," and "Technical Operation Process Table." Due to the implementation of these work methods, technical accidents and obstacles have been completely eliminated. The work is not as busy as it used to be.
    Now I am actively learning from the advanced Soviet experience to further improve my professional level and respond to Comrade Gorasnabira from the Soviet Union with practical actions.

### 苏联先进经验  战胜了我的保守思想

    苏联先进经验
    战胜了我的保守思想
    编辑同志：我现在已经是一个十四年路龄的电务领工员了。一九五○年中长铁路未推广苏联先进经验之前，亚布洛尼电务驻在所的工作非常混乱。当时管通讯和信号的工人工作没有计划，盲目地跑到各站去检查工作，有时候忙得连饭都顾不上吃，但工作没有做好。同时，由于我们不总结工作，工友们的技术水平也没法提高。因此，平均每月总要发生三、四件事故。自从中长铁路成立后，苏联派来大批专家帮助我们管理铁路，推行了苏联的先进工作法。最初，我没有认识到推广先进经验是完成各项工作的基本方法，我总觉得新经验不如老一套顺手，新办法要填这个表那个报的，又麻烦、又浪费时间。因此，对推广先进经验采取消极态度，不愿学习，后来经过党的教育，和别的地方的推广成绩，特别是我那位敬爱的老师——苏联哥拉斯那必拉同志的耐心帮助，我才克服了保守思想。我每次到段里开会的时候，他都主动地帮我订学习计划，热心地教我。现在我已学会了“大中修”、“日常维修法”、“技术作业过程表”等六种先进工作法。由于推行了这些工作法，根本消灭了技术性事故和障碍。工作也不像过去那样忙乱了。
    现在我正积极地学习苏联先进经验，更进一步提高业务水平，以实际行动回答苏联哥拉斯那必拉同志。
