    Several Organizations Near Baojia Street in Beijing
    Jointly Establish an Amateur Cultural School
    To the Editor:
    Several organizations near Baojia Street in Xidan District, Beijing (Beijing Russian Language School, Xinzhong Middle School, Beijing Municipal Public Health Bureau, All-China Federation of Trade Unions Guest House, Zhenhua Printing Factory), jointly established a "Baojia Street Amateur Cultural School" in early September. The aim is to eliminate illiteracy and semi-literacy in all of these units in about a year, and to raise the educational level of some cadres and support staff with low education to the level of junior high school graduation within three to five years. The plan is to promote the rapid literacy method in the first year (divided into rapid literacy and consolidation stages), study Chinese language and rapid arithmetic in the second year, and then gradually complete subjects such as Chinese language, mathematics, physics, chemistry, history, and geography in the following three years.
    In the past, we had run amateur schools, but due to lack of teachers, classrooms, funds, and other reasons, we could not persist. This time, after the various units organized their forces and jointly established this amateur cultural school, the above problems have been solved.
    Currently, the number of students in the school has increased to more than 370, and the number of classes has increased to 13. The school currently has one professional cadre, responsible for educational administration. The teachers are all part-time.
    The units are no more than five minutes away from each other, so the classrooms are located in various units: Xinzhong Middle School and Beijing Russian Language School each have two classrooms, Zhenhua Printing Factory has one, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions Guest House has one, and two more classrooms are set up in Baojia Street Elementary School.
    The teaching time is set at four times a week, two sessions each time (one session is forty minutes). There are no classes on Wednesdays and Saturdays. Due to the different nature of work in each unit, the class time is divided into morning and evening classes. The morning class is from 6:30 AM to 8:00 AM, and the evening class is from 7:30 PM to 9:00 PM. In this way, most illiterate and semi-literate people can participate in learning, except for a few people in each unit whose work is special (such as gatekeepers, nannies, etc.). The administrative leaders of each unit guarantee that each student has six hours of self-study time per week. The school has also established a strict leave system.
    Jointly running an amateur school can save a lot of expenses. In the past, the monthly teacher subsidy for the Beijing Russian Language School's amateur night school was as high as more than 700 catties of millet, while there were less than 100 students. Now, with more than 370 students in the school, the monthly teacher subsidy is only 1,000 catties of millet. The school stipulates that each student pays 40 catties of millet per semester (all borne by the trade unions or administrations of each unit), which is estimated to be sufficient to cover expenses.
    We have had many failed lessons in the cultural learning of staff in government offices. The reason is that the problems of teachers, classrooms, funds, and a small number of classes cannot be satisfactorily resolved. The experience of the Baojia Street Joint Amateur Cultural School is worth promoting.

### 北京鲍家街附近各机关联合创办业余文化学校

    北京鲍家街附近各机关
    联合创办业余文化学校
    编辑同志：我们北京西单区鲍家街附近的几个机关（北京俄文专修学校、新中中学、北京市公共卫生局、全国总工会招待所、振华印刷厂），于九月初联合创办了一个“鲍家街业余文化学校”，目的是争取在一年左右的时间内扫除各该单位所有文盲及半文盲，并使部分文化程度低的干部、杂务人员在三、五年内提高到初中毕业程度。计划第一年推行速成识字法（分速成识字与巩固两个阶段），第二年学习语文与速成算术，其后三年逐步完成语文、数学、物理、化学、历史、地理等科。
    过去，我们曾办过业余学校，但由于缺乏教员、教室、经费等种种原因，不能坚持下去。这一次各单位将力量组织起来，联合创办了这个业余文化学校后，上述这些问题都得到了解决。
    现全校学生已增至三百七十余名，班次已增至十三个。全校现有专业干部一人，负责教育行政工作。教员都系兼任。
    各单位相距最远的不过五分钟左右的路程，因此教室就分设在各单位：新中中学、北京俄文专修学校各设两个教室，振华印刷厂设一个，中华全国总工会招待所设一个，另外又在鲍家街小学设立了两个教室。
    教学时间确定每周上课四次，每次两小节（一小节为四十分钟）。星期三、六无课。因各单位工作性质不同，上课时间分为早晚两班，早班从早晨六点半至八点，晚班从下午七点半至九点。这样，各单位除个别人员因工作性质特殊（如看门人、褓姆等）不能参加学习以外，绝大多数文盲、半文盲均可参加学习。各单位行政领导方面保证每个学员每周有六小时的自习时间。学校又建立了严格的请假制度。
    联合举办业余学校，可以节省很多的经费。过去北京俄文专修学校的业余夜校，教员津贴最高每月达七百余斤小米，而学生不足一百人，现在全校三百七十余人，每月教员津贴不过一千斤小米。学校规定每个学员每学期收费四十斤小米（都由各单位的工会或行政负担），估计已足够开支。
    在机关工作人员的文化学习方面，我们已有很多失败的教训，原因是教员、教室、经费，人少班次多等等的问题不能圆满解决。鲍家街联合业余文化学校的经验，是值得推广的。
