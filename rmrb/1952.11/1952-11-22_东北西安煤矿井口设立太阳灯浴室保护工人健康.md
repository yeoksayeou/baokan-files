    Northeast Xi'an Coal Mine Establishes Solar Lamp Bathrooms at Mine Entrances to Protect Workers' Health
    To the Editor: At the Central Shaft of the Northeast Xi'an Coal Mine, in the past, due to the high temperatures underground, 48% of workers suffered from rheumatic arthritis. To protect the workers' health, the Xi'an Coal Mine, starting in February this year, began learning from advanced Soviet experiences and established solar lamp bathrooms at the mine entrances. Significant results have already been achieved. After irradiation, most patients no longer experience aches and pains, their appetites have improved, and they sleep better. Currently, the incidence of rheumatic arthritis among workers has dropped from 48% to 4.2 per thousand. The workers' red blood cell count and weight have both increased.

    东北西安煤矿井口设立太阳灯浴室保护工人健康
    编辑同志：东北西安煤矿中央竖井，过去因井下温度大，工人患风湿性关节炎的占百分之四十八。为保护工人身体健康，西安煤矿从今年二月开始，学习苏联先进经验，在井口设立太阳灯浴室，现已获得很大成绩。患者经过照射后，大部分没有酸痛症状了，食欲增进，睡眠好转。目前，工人风湿性关节炎的病率，已由百分之四十八，降至千分之四点二。工人们的赤血球和体重均有增加。
