Xinhua News Agency, New York, November 3rd: The Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly continued to debate the Korean issue on October 31st and November 1st. At the meeting on October 31st, representatives from Australia, the Netherlands, Greece, and other countries spoke in support of the US position and proposals regarding the repatriation of prisoners of war. The Belgian representative also expressed general support for the US position.

At the morning meeting on November 1st, Polish Foreign Minister Skrzeszewski spoke. He warned that the US proposal would prolong the Korean War. Everyone who sincerely wants a peaceful resolution of the Korean War would support the Soviet proposal. In Acheson's speech, which went so far as to distort the facts in order to defend the US attitude, there was nothing to promote peace. The whole world knows that the United States bears the responsibility for the aggression against Korea, and it is now doing everything possible to obstruct the peaceful resolution of this war.

Skrzeszewski pointed out that after the US representatives at Panmunjom refused to continue negotiations, the US then refused North Korea's participation in the debate at this session of the General Assembly, which most powerfully proves the US is determined to obstruct a peaceful resolution.

After listing the provocative acts committed by the US, such as shelling the neutral zone, Skrzeszewski explained how the US made the issue of prisoners of war an obstacle to reaching an agreement. He pointed out that the so-called principle of "no forced repatriation" is not a real issue at all. The facts of the US military's brutal massacre of prisoners of war fully expose the absurdity of this issue. If the prisoners of war really did not want to go home, then the US military would not have needed to use tanks and flamethrowers to break their resistance and force them to refuse repatriation.

In conclusion, Skrzeszewski asked everyone to support the Soviet proposal and reject the US proposal.

Also speaking at the morning meeting on November 1st were Kuomintang element Yeh Kung-chao, as well as the representatives of New Zealand and Sweden, all of whom expressed support for the US proposal.

    在联合国大会政治委员会上
    波兰代表支持苏联关于朝鲜问题的建议
    【新华社三日讯】塔斯社纽约讯：联合国大会政治委员会于十月三十一日、十一月一日继续辩论朝鲜问题。在十月三十一日的会议上，澳大利亚、荷兰、希腊等国的代表发言支持美国关于遣返战俘问题的立场和提案。比利时代表也表示一般地支持美国的立场。
    在十一月一日上午的会议上，波兰外交部长斯克列杰夫斯基发言。他警告说：美国的建议会使朝鲜战争拖延下去。每个真想和平解决朝鲜战争的人一定会支持苏联的建议。在艾奇逊为了辩解美国态度而不惜歪曲事实的演说里，找不到任何能促成和平的意见。全世界都知道美国负有侵略朝鲜的责任，它现在正百般阻挠这个战争的和平解决。
    斯克列杰夫斯基指出：在板门店谈判美方代表拒绝继续进行谈判之后，美国又拒绝北朝鲜参加本届大会的辩论，这就最有力地证明了美国立意阻挠和平解决。
    斯克列杰夫斯基在列举美方所进行的炮轰中立区等挑衅行为后，说明了美国怎样使战俘问题成为缔结协议的障碍。他指出：所谓不准“强迫遣返”的原则，根本不是一个真正的问题。美军残酷屠杀战俘的事实就充分暴露了这个问题的荒谬性质。若是战俘真的不肯回家，那么美军是用不着用坦克和喷火器来打破他们的反抗并强迫他们拒绝回国的。
    斯克列杰夫斯基在发言结语中要求大家支持苏联的建议，否决美国的提案。
    在十一月一日上午会议上发言的，还有国民党分子叶公超以及新西兰代表和瑞典代表，他们都表示支持美国的提案。
