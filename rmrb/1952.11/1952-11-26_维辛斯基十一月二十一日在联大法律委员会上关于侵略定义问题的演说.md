Vyshinsky's Speech on the Definition of Aggression at the UN Legal Committee on November 21

The definition of aggression has its own history. This issue attracted attention, particularly in the context of the League of Nations' activities, before the Second World War. Since the establishment of the United Nations, this issue has also been a focus of attention. The issue of aggression is inextricably linked to another of the most important issues in international law and policy—the issue of collective security. This, in turn, is closely linked to the issue of disarmament or, at the very least, the reduction of armaments.

When we resume the discussion on the definition of "aggression," it is necessary to recall the history of this issue, to remember its most important features, and to review the path it has already taken. For example, we cannot fail to recall the fact that as early as 1927, during the League of Nations era, a special so-called "Arbitration and Security Committee" was established at the fourth session of the Preparatory Commission. This committee spent two years defining "aggression" and achieved some success, but due to the various obstacles placed in its path by the Western powers, it was unable to complete its work successfully.

Other attempts in this regard met with similar fates. As early as 1933, the Soviet delegation at the Disarmament Conference reminded everyone of this situation, pointing out that the committees and conferences working on drafts for security and disarmament were merely going in circles, and I must add, in a vicious circle. They kept going in circles without guaranteeing that the governments of the countries participating in these committees and conferences would actually break out of this vicious circle and take a clear path to resolve such an important international relations issue as international peace and security.

One of the reasons for this abnormal situation was that the major Western European countries hoped to use the schemes for ensuring international security and disarmament—or even the complete abolition of armaments—as a cover to prepare measures to turn international agreements on these issues into weapons against the Soviet Union. This was the consistent policy pursued by all international conferences and committees on security and disarmament at that time.

Germany re-emerged on the historical stage; its militarism and aggression policies received extensive support from the United States, Britain, and France, which had loosened the constraints on Fascist Germany and cleared the way for German aggression. The refusal of the United States, Britain, and France to sign the collective security pact proposed by the Soviet Union in 1936 showed that they were unwilling to counter the growing threat of Hitler's aggression. Encouraged by the attitude of the United States, Britain, and France, Hitler's Germany became increasingly bold and resolutely took the path of militarization and the extensive development of the military industry. Large amounts of dollars nurtured Germany's war industry and fed its aggression. With the encouragement and help of the reactionary cliques of the United States, Britain, and France, Germany's preparations for aggressive war intensified year by year. The policy of the reactionary cliques of the United States, Britain, and France was not to oppose German aggression but to isolate the Soviet Union and direct German aggression eastward, towards the Soviet Union.

The Soviet Union's proposals for peace and disarmament were obviously incompatible with the policies that stirred the desires of German militarists and revanchists. Therefore, all the Soviet drafts and proposals were rejected amidst the clamor of appeasement declarations and international agreements with dubious peaceful intentions. The notorious Briand-Kellogg Pact of 1928 is an example of such an international agreement.

The Briand-Kellogg Pact ostensibly prohibited the use of war as a tool of national policy, but in reality, its purpose was to become a weapon for isolating and striking the Soviet Union; the Soviet Union had already pointed out its intentions and purposes at that time. In a note dated August 31, 1928, the Soviet People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs pointed out that these reservations could only be considered as an attempt to use the pact as a tool for imperialist policy.

The Soviet government pointed out in its note that it was necessary to prohibit all wars between nations, especially wars aimed at suppressing national liberation movements, as well as acts of interference, blockade, military occupation of foreign territories, foreign ports, etc. The Soviet People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs, in response to the suggestion that the Soviet Union agree to the Kellogg-Briand Pact, stated: "In recent years, there have been several wars that have brought great disasters to the peoples of many countries. Several Soviet republics have been the objects of such attacks, and currently, four hundred million Chinese people are suffering from such attacks. Moreover, such conflicts often develop into wars that are absolutely impossible to stop."

Although the Soviet government saw all the hidden plans of the drafters of the Briand-Kellogg Pact and all its major flaws, it still agreed to sign the pact because the Soviet government considered that the pact objectively "imposed certain obligations on the signatory countries to public opinion and gave the Soviet government the opportunity to raise an issue of great importance to peace with the signatory countries of the pact, namely, the issue of disarmament, the solution of which is the only guarantee against war."

Everyone knows that the Briand-Kellogg Pact did not prevent the war-mongers from making countless provocations against the Soviet Union.

In order to ensure that the Briand-Kellogg Pact is implemented to the greatest extent possible and that the institution established specifically to ensure that the signatory countries of the pact fulfill their obligations can play the greatest role, it is necessary for this institution to have the corresponding rules of action. This requires defining aggression, defining the distinction between aggression and self-defense, and exposing the deceptive excuses usually used by the aggressor to justify their aggression. The Soviet Union proposed a historic definition of "aggression" in 1933 precisely for this purpose.

The Soviet government was already clearly aware of the difficulties it would encounter when proposing the definition of aggression. As early as 1933, the Soviet government pointed out that it anticipated what objections and comments legal experts and other experts might raise against this definition. It estimated that some people would point out that it is impossible to give an absolute definition of aggression, that situations not provided for in the definition may actually occur, and that it is very difficult to determine which side attacked first—this is the most important question.

We know that this foresight was very correct. For nearly twenty-five years, we have repeatedly heard these objections to the Soviet definition. Unfortunately, the reasons we hear are always the same, just repeated over and over again. These reasons have been refuted many times and have shown their true purpose. And today, in 1952, those who oppose our definition are repeating what their predecessors said as early as 1933, without being able to make their arguments more convincing. We emphasized at the time that we did not claim to have given an absolute definition, especially because we knew that there is no such thing as an absolute definition and that there cannot be an absolute definition. No definition, no matter how perfect, can include all the variations and extraordinary events of life. No international law or domestic law can set such a goal. But this will be discussed in more detail later.

In the definition of aggression proposed by the Soviet Union in 1933, the basic principles that should be followed in defining aggression were outlined, and it was emphasized that the task in this work is to find a solution to the security issue that will not become the target of diplomatic maneuvering and that will be beneficial not only to the strong but also to the weak countries.

Obviously, the adoption of this proposal could have a significant impact on the resolution of international conflicts, but there is a condition: the countries that agree to this definition must honestly, consistently, objectively, and justly apply the international agreement on the definition of aggression, that is, they must adhere to the principles they have agreed to at all times and in all places, rather than according to some "impression" as the American representative said at the Sixth Session and here; they must adhere to the principles of defining aggression, not according to the "impression" of the American representative; they must strictly adhere to the definitions and resolutions included in the international agreements they have concluded, not according to the "individual opinions" of each country involved in the situation.

However, we must point out that the representatives of the United States, Britain, and other countries that sing high praises of various intuitive, psychological, and similar arguments have, in fact, denied these conditions.

The history we have discussed here shows that the Western countries, when signing treaties such as the Briand-Kellogg Pact and discussing the definition of aggression, tried to prove that such a definition is impossible to produce, but at the same time, they colluded with other countries that did not hide their aggressive intentions. The situation in 1933 was like this. At that time, the four countries of Britain, Germany, France, and Italy signed the so-called "Four-Power Pact" in Rome. That pact only reflected the collusion between the governments of Britain and France at that time with the Fascism of Germany and Italy, aiming to undermine the line of peace-loving countries against aggressive countries. Such an agreement was a blow to the peace-loving efforts that sought to achieve consensus on measures to combat aggression, to achieve a unified opinion on the guidance of international organizations responsible for opposing aggression, and to facilitate the struggle against aggression.

Therefore, at that time, on the one hand, there was the Soviet Union's anti-aggression proposal, and on the other hand, there was the Four-Power Pact that opened the door to the aggressors. Therefore, although the Soviet government tried to prevent the danger of aggressive war, the result of such efforts was quite clear. Subsequent developments confirmed this most tragic assumption: the Soviet Union's noble efforts failed. To better understand the extremely unfavorable international situation for the passage of any measures to prevent aggressive war at that time, we must not forget things like the serious economic crisis from 1929 to the end of 1933, which affected many capitalist countries, especially the United States, exacerbated their contradictions, and led to the formation of the breeding ground for war in the Far East; the Briand-Kellogg Pact could not prevent the danger of war and could not alleviate it in the slightest.

The League of Nations could only pass some vague resolutions, which actually encouraged Japan to take further aggressive actions. In February 1933, the British Foreign Secretary Simon defended Japan's aggression in the House of Commons, finally leading to the occupation of Northeast China by Japan. The United States supported the recommendations of the Lytton Commission appointed by the League of Nations Council and, after investigating the causes and nature of the Sino-Japanese conflict, still recognized Japan's "special rights and interests" in that region of China. At the same time, there was an increasingly intense propaganda that openly called for war against the Soviet Union and received the support of the Pope. The international situation in 1932, that is, before the Soviet government proposed the definition of aggression, was considered a "state of war in fact," although this war was not registered and proven by a notary, it was actually taking place on a vast piece of land far from Europe.

At that time, Britain and the United States did not make any effort to help resolve the Sino-Japanese conflict. This conflict only represented the aggressive actions of Japanese imperialists against China. At that time, Britain and the United States also adopted an attitude of supporting Hitler's aggressive policy, when Hitler had already begun his plunder plans, threatening the unfortunate leaders of British and American policy, and claiming to be the savior of the world from the influence of "world Bolshevism."

At that time, all capitalist countries were madly preparing for another war to redivide the world and divide spheres of influence; the forces of armament and expansion prevailed over the forces of peace, and the two opposing capitalist camps concentrated their efforts on armament and expansion.

At that time, the threat of Fascist aggression was increasingly looming over the entire world. The whole world was alarmed by the developments within Germany and Hitler's diplomatic intrigues. Hitler's diplomatic attempts used declarations of peace as a cover to conceal the attacks on neighboring countries that the Hitlerites were preparing.

As for the other capitalist countries in Western Europe, their policy was to make chauvinism and war preparation the basic elements of their foreign policy, and in domestic politics, to suppress the working class and implement terrorist measures as necessary to consolidate the rear for future warfare.

This was a brilliant, accurate, and appropriate description by the head of the Soviet government, Stalin, in 1934, of the foreign policy of the capitalist countries in Western Europe, pointing out that "a new imperialist war as a way out of the status quo is increasingly approaching." Although, as Stalin said, there was no reason to assume that war could provide a way out; war could only make the situation worse.

The international situation at that time was such. Therefore, the Soviet government proposed at the Disarmament Conference in February 1933 the issue of formulating authoritative guiding principles for disarmament and universal security, and proposed a historic suggestion on the definition of aggression. This suggestion listed all the actions that all countries should guarantee as acts of aggression, and all the actions that all countries should guarantee to prevent aggression and consolidate peace.

The British representative in his speech on November 19 did not want to mention all this. He opposed any definition of aggression, arguing that such a definition would not stop the aggressors but would only harm the victims. He mentioned the events of 1914 when Germany attacked Belgium, 1939 when the Hitler gang attacked Poland, 1931 and 1937 when Japanese aggressors attacked Northeast China, and Mussolini's attack on Abyssinia. He pointed out that these facts are typical examples of various aggressions, saying that the definition of aggression would have no effect on all these events. He listed these examples to prove that in all these events, the definition of aggression would not provide any guarantee for the victims. However, this logic cannot stand up to scrutiny. If the governments that undertake obligations and guarantee to abide by the laws that prevent crimes first violate their obligations and break these laws, then any definition, pact, or the strictest international law cannot prevent crimes. This is a natural thing. The historical examples cited by the British representative proved the opposite of what he wanted to prove.

We cannot analyze all the examples cited by the British representative here. But it is enough to analyze the event of Mussolini's attack on Abyssinia. Mussolini prepared for the attack on Abyssinia in full view of the world. Abyssinia's request for protection and help from the League of Nations was ineffective. Italian troops occupied Abyssinia. The French representative Laval and the British representative Hoare said they would impose sanctions on the aggressors, but in fact, they did not stop Mussolini from carrying out his plunder plan in any way. Only the Soviet government demanded that the member states of the League of Nations not evade their obligations under the League of Nations Covenant. Molotov, representing the Soviet government at the time, said: "Only the Soviet Union took a special principled position distinct from any imperialism and any colonial aggression policy in the Italo-Abyssinian War. Only the Soviet Union declared that it acted according to the principle of equal rights and independence of Abyssinia—moreover, it is a member of the League of Nations—and it could not support any action by the League of Nations or individual capitalist countries to violate this independence and equal rights."

All subsequent developments only strengthened the Rome-Berlin Fascist "axis."

The representatives of the United States and Britain should remember these things and not deviate from the subject to slander the Soviet Union's policy towards Finland and the Baltic Soviet Socialist Republics or the policy of the North Korean government towards the American aggression in Korea.

Due to the stance taken by the major countries in Western Europe—Britain and France—the evolution of the international situation at that time was very favorable to the war-mongers. Under such circumstances, all peace-loving peoples were in urgent need of reaching an agreement; they had to agree on what measures to take to prevent the threat of war, what measures to take to resist aggression, and to reach a common opinion on what actions are considered acts of aggression and to condemn the countries that take such actions as aggressors.

The representative of Venezuela, who spoke against the definition of aggression, cited a statement as an argument for his viewpoint, saying that in a serious international situation, it is impossible to expect a perfect definition of aggression. In our view, precisely because the international situation is serious and full of the threat of aggressive war, it is necessary to strive to eliminate this serious situation and eliminate the threat of impending aggression. This is the goal pursued by those countries that seek to reach an agreement on the definition of aggression, thereby giving the Security Council the tools to fight for peace.

In the view of the Venezuelan representative, the situation is just the opposite. He believes that in a serious international situation, no measures should be taken to change this situation.

Based on this argument, the representative concluded that precisely because of the current international situation, it is not convenient to define aggression. He believed that this matter should be left to the Security Council to handle, as he said, the Security Council would "intuitively" and "according to common sense" decide this issue, just like a monkey, because the Venezuelan representative told us that a monkey also knows very clearly what aggression is when it is struck by a stone.

This is the conclusion reached by the contemporary skeptics who continue to advocate against the passage of the definition of aggression. Some countries have stubbornly insisted on this stance for more than twenty years, and these countries—Britain, the United States, Belgium, Greece, Sweden, and some other countries—are still opposing our definition today.

At this point, I would like to recall the work of the special committee of the Temporary Joint Committee established in 1923, which was to provide opinions on the issue of determining acts of aggression. The Temporary Joint Committee stated in its report that it is impossible to determine acts of aggression even in theory under modern warfare conditions.

Everyone knows that the Joint Committee at that time rejected the method of defining aggression. At that time, the issue of defining "aggression" was rejected, and this issue was limited to the draft of a joint assistance treaty prepared by the Third Committee of the League of Nations in 1933, which reduced the entire definition of aggression to a single sentence: any act of aggression is an international crime. However, this was not its task; its task should have been to determine what kind of war is aggressive, in other words, to determine the main characteristics of aggression. That draft also said that a certain war is not aggressive, but it did not clearly point out what war is aggressive.

Moreover, on the basis of disapproval of the definition of aggression, a principle was established, which in itself was incorrect and did not correspond to the true task of defining aggression.

This principle stipulated that if one party to a dispute is a country that has accepted the unanimous recommendation of the League of Nations Council, accepted the decision of the Permanent Court of International Justice or an arbitration decision, then the war waged by this country against the other party that did not accept such a recommendation is not considered aggressive. Therefore, a non-aggressive war is a war that the League of Nations Council, the Permanent Court of International Justice, or an arbitration decision considers not aggressive. Therefore, the majority of the above-mentioned institutions of the League of Nations can arbitrarily handle all matters, or more precisely, the majority of the institutions of the League of Nations can arbitrarily handle or arbitrate all matters.

This did not eliminate the danger that resolutions could be passed according to the interests of a certain group, or that a simple conspiracy could be made between certain competing groups.

When the Soviet delegation proposed its draft on the determination of the meaning of aggression to the General Committee on February 6, 1933, it encountered strong opposition from the representatives of many countries. For example, Mr. Eden insisted that the issue of determining the meaning of aggression was not an issue that could represent the national interests of any country participating in the Disarmament Conference.

Mr. Eden said that this issue seemed to be a purely scientific issue, and the interests of all countries in this issue were the same. We cannot agree with this view because the issue of determining the meaning of aggression is a very important and acute issue in foreign policy, an issue with very practical interests.

In his speech at the Disarmament and Limitation of Armaments Conference on May 25, 1933, Mr. Eden opposed the draft prepared by the committee chaired by Politi based on the Soviet proposal, which stated that this plan was very simple and inflexible, and said that it was not necessary to have a formal document signed by all countries of the world to guarantee such a result, namely, to recognize the first country to initiate an attack as the aggressor.

The British representative pointed out that the definition of aggression proposed by the committee would probably have a satisfactory effect in very simple cases. However, in such cases, a definition is generally not needed. As for the extremely important cases of determining the definition of aggression, in Mr. Eden's view, such a definition is not only questionable in terms of its usefulness but is clearly harmful.

The basis for this statement is a completely arbitrary misinterpretation of the Soviet proposal. He did not study the essence of the proposal but interpreted the Soviet proposal, as Mr. Eden said, as an absolute, rigid, and mechanical definition, saying that this definition depends only on one fact: which of the two parties to the dispute first commits one of the acts specified in the text.

However, the reasons for this statement are extremely insufficient. The British representative said at the main committee of the Disarmament Conference in 1933 when discussing the issue of aggression: during periods of international tension, when the armies of both sides are concentrated on the border and conflict can occur at any time, it can be said with certainty that the question of which side of the armies first crosses the border is of secondary importance, because it is necessary to determine which of the two countries is the real aggressor according to past facts.

Indeed, the facts before the attack are of great significance, and in many cases, these facts even have a decisive significance in determining who the aggressor is.

However, in the definition of the term "aggression" proposed by the Soviet Union, it was not said that in handling the issue of aggression, it is not necessary to mention the previous facts. This is precisely the direct responsibility of the Security Council, which, according to Article 39 of the United Nations Charter, should determine what actions are acts of aggression and recommend what measures to take to maintain or restore international peace and security. The Soviet draft determined that the country that first commits the acts mentioned in the draft should be regarded as the aggressor in international conflicts, but this does not mean that in examining the entire issue, it is limited to determining this fact, because the original text of the draft clearly states that the issue to be discussed is: this country must be one of the following situations: declaring war on another country first, the armed forces first attacking the territory of another country, first bombing the territory of another country, or first attacking the ships, aircraft, etc., of another country.

Almost twenty years later, Mr. Fitzmaurice, the British representative to the Sixth Committee of the Seventh Session of the United Nations, still insisted on the same view, claiming that due to the current situation of international relations and what he called modern warfare methods and modern aggression techniques, it is not only useless but also dangerous to define aggression.

His opinion is the same as that expressed by Mr. Eden some time ago, believing that it is not appropriate to define aggression at present.

However, the British representative did not clearly explain in his speech on November 19 why it is not appropriate to define aggression now; he also did not explain what modern warfare methods and modern aggression techniques make it impossible for us to define aggression and make the definition of aggression a harmful and dangerous act. Aggression is aggression, that is, an attack, regardless of the warfare methods adopted or the attack techniques adopted, this does not hinder the task of defining aggression, nor does it hinder us from pointing out the characteristics of aggression based on the experience of many wars recorded in historical annals. The British representative tried hard to make people believe that defining aggression is of no use, saying that this work is full of intrigue and danger, wanting to prove that the committee has no moral right to advise the General Assembly to accept the definition of aggression. He said that his government, based on its long experience of successfully resisting aggression, firmly believes that a definition cannot stop the aggressors but will only become an obstacle for the victims.

As for Britain's experience before the Second World War, it does not prove that the British ruling class has experience in resisting aggression. On the contrary, it proves the opposite. We can recall Chamberlain and Daladier signing the Four-Power Pact with Hitler and Mussolini in 1933 to encourage the Fascist aggression plans of Germany and Italy; we can also recall another treaty signed with British help, namely, the Hitler-Polish Non-Aggression Pact signed in 1934, which played an important role in Germany's preparations for aggression; in addition, there are many well-known similar facts.

Therefore, if this experience is their basis, then it is natural that the hope for the British representatives to show sympathy for the issue of defining aggression will be in vain.

In my opinion, Senator Grun, the American representative, is more in line with the facts. He said that there is no actual experience in the history of Britain and the United States regarding the rules and measures to resist aggression, and therefore, there is no sufficient experience in the application of the rules of aggression. However, everyone knows that there are many historical facts that prove that the United States has actual experience in aggression and supporting aggressors. Setting aside these, the American senator clearly said that the United States is still opposed to defining aggression, believing that it is not suitable for the American ruling class.

In such events, the British and American delegations have famous British politicians like Robert Cecil as their teachers. Cecil was the "blockade" minister of the Lloyd George cabinet from 1916 to 1918 and one of the organizers of the League of Nations. Lord Cecil served as the chairman of the special committee of the Temporary Joint Committee, whose duty was to provide opinions on the issue of determining acts of aggression. The report of this special committee said that even in theory, it is impossible to define aggression under modern warfare conditions. This committee opposed any method of defining aggression, pointing out that the governments of various countries can only decide on their judgment of aggression based on impressions.

Lord Cecil, although insisting that it is impossible to define aggression even in theory, was engaged in aggression in actual actions. In December 1917, he concluded a secret pact with France regarding the division of spheres of influence in Russia and supporting the reactionary gang of Yudenich, who was then fighting against the young Soviet Republic.

In Mr. Eden's speech at the Disarmament Conference in 1933, his opposition to the proposal to define aggression was based on the opinion of a very respected British politician who had served as a British representative on the League of Nations Council for many years. This very respected politician said that the definition of aggression could only become a trap for the innocent and a haven for criminals.

This very respected politician is the well-known Austin Chamberlain, whose reactionary and aggressive nature of policy is also well known.

Under the leadership of political figures like Cecil and Austin Chamberlain, it is completely understandable that it is impossible to expect the British diplomatic community to support the drafting of various measures to combat aggression, just as it is difficult to expect the current British representatives to support such measures.

Therefore, it is not accidental that the representatives of the countries belonging to the North Atlantic Aggression Pact are determined to oppose any definition of aggression and strive to find a theoretical basis for their stance.

This time, the American representative did not elaborate on his views on the definition of aggression. This issue is currently being discussed in the Sixth Committee. Moreover, he said that the United States still does not know the reason for continuing the work of defining aggression at this session. From the little he said this time, it is clear that the United States believes it is impossible to support a definition that does not include all possible cases of aggression. Judging from his speech, he suggested that the task of this committee should be limited to the scope specified in Article 39 of the United Nations Charter, which states: "The Security Council shall determine the existence of any threat to the peace, breach of the peace, or act of aggression." The American delegation believes that it is not possible to give a precise and perfect definition of these three concepts, and therefore, there is no reason to attempt to give a more perfect definition of the concept of aggression than the concepts of "threat to the peace" or "breach of the peace."

It is worth mentioning that the view held by the United States in 1945 is different from today's view, which is the view supported by the Soviet Union today. From the public statements of the American delegation, the reason for the United States' change of position on this matter is the fact that the current situation of international relations has made the United States believe that defining aggression is not only inappropriate but also dangerous. The American delegation announced that the new position taken by the American government is completely opposite to its position in 1945, and this is entirely due to the international situation.

Therefore, the whole issue boils down to the current international situation. Everyone knows that the center of the current international situation is the aggressive policy of the United States, which aims to prepare for a new world war and seize the hegemony to rule the world.

Title: The U.S. and the Definition of Aggression

Xinhua News Agency, New York, December 23rd

Under the guise of criticism, the United States blatantly distorts facts. Despite the United States' public acknowledgment of these facts, U.S. officials still hypocritically express their willingness to continue working on defining aggression, although they doubt the success of this endeavor. Moreover, they attempt to conceal their disapproval of this work, using various reasons to cover it up. However, the contrived nature of these reasons is evident to all. One of these reasons is: the very nature of the concept of aggression makes it impossible to define it precisely. If one insists on defining it, one must use terms that themselves need definitions, which they call an insurmountable difficulty.

The unreliability of the arguments presented by the U.S., British, and other countries' delegations on this issue can be proven by the definition of aggression proposed by the Soviet delegation on February 6, 1933, and the series of conventions on the definition of aggression concluded by the Soviet Union with Latvia, Italy, Poland, Romania, Turkey, Iran, Afghanistan, Czechoslovakia, and Lithuania from July 3 to 5, 1933, based on this definition. It can also be proven by similar conventions, such as the Inter-American Reciprocal Assistance Treaty (signed in Rio de Janeiro on September 2, 1947).

This alone is sufficient to refute the British representative's claim that due to the nature of aggression, it is impossible to give a precise definition of the term "aggression," and that if one insists on defining aggression, one must use terms that themselves need definitions, thus supposedly creating an insurmountable difficulty.

Critics of the draft definition of aggression proposed by the Soviet delegation argue that if the principle on which this definition is based—that a country is considered an aggressor if it first attacks another—were to be implemented, then Britain would have been the aggressor in 1914 when it declared war on Germany, because Germany had only invaded Belgium, not Britain. Others point out that similarly, in 1939, when France and Britain notified the League of Nations that they were at war with Germany, the situation was the same. The absurdity of this argument needs no proof, as it is clearly a deliberate distortion of the meaning and wording of the Soviet draft. Here, without going into further details, I will only mention the response of the British Chief Prosecutor at the Nuremberg trials, Sir Hartley Shawcross, on December 4, 1945, during the trial of the Nazi leaders in the International Military Tribunal:

"At the outset of the Second World War, Britain and France notified the League of Nations that from September 3, 1939, they were at war with Germany. They declared that Germany had invaded Poland, thereby not only violating its obligations to Poland but also its obligations to the other signatory countries of the Paris Pact."

The violation of obligations by a signatory country to a pact is equivalent to an attack on the other signatory countries, and they have every right to view the matter in this light.

The impartiality of the conclusion reached by the British Chief Prosecutor at the Nuremberg trials is beyond reproach, which confirms that such criticisms of the Soviet definition are entirely untenable. These critics exhaust every effort to argue against the value of the definition proposed by the Soviet Union. They say that humans have a natural, innate concept of aggression, a concept that is innate to humanity. Some critics, based on this argument, use the example of two children fighting to illustrate this concept, but this cannot lead to a clear legal standard. The analogy of comparing combatants to two children fighting is sheer nonsense. The absurdity of this analogy is so obvious that even the critics themselves are fully aware of it, and therefore they have now resorted to another new analogy, that of the judges in criminal courts.

The Greek representative at the Sixth Session of the United Nations pointed out: for example, a judge should decide whether there has been an attack based on the various circumstances of the case he is trying, even though he has read many criminal codes that discuss attacks. This inference is no better than the first one, because it is known that although a judge should announce a verdict based on the circumstances of the case—there is no other way to do this—at the same time, he should determine the crime and punish it according to the law and within the scope of the law.

Therefore, if a judge judges a case based on intuition and a natural concept of aggression, it would be a ridiculous thing.

To pick faults with our definition, critics point out: the definition of aggression must at least have two elements, the objective element and the subjective element. They admit that the objective element, or the objective standard for determining aggression, is a direct, indirect, or covert act of aggression by one country before the other party's similar action. The word "before" means the party that first takes such action. This is exactly what the draft definition proposed by the Soviet Union says.

Of course, in any definition, it is impossible to list all examples of direct, indirect, or covert aggression, just as in any criminal law, it is impossible to list all possible examples of murder, assault, defamation, and other such acts. This can be seen from the following example. The criminal law stipulates defamation, but it does not clearly state what words are considered defamation under this criminal law. There can be many different words, and the tone in which these words are spoken can also vary. A sentence or a quotation can be considered defamatory. For example, a person, upon meeting someone, says in the tone of Reynard the Fox meeting an ass: "Ah, my learned friend, have you perhaps been to some place!" Such words can defame a person.

This is indeed defamation, but you will not find a specific regulation on this particular issue in the criminal law. And this is quite understandable.

To deal with crimes, it is sufficient to point out the most general, most typical, and most important examples. This is exactly what our definition stipulates. Therefore, a definition that meets the above conditions, even if it does not exhaustively list all possible examples of aggression, is absolutely not to be rejected.

We should remember: any deductive scientific definition is always less clear and less valuable than a definition based on experience rather than deduction.

As for the standard for measuring the subjective aspect of aggression, the so-called subjective intention of aggression, it is determined by many facts, by the nature of all the activities of the aggressor before the attack.

In this regard, it is best to recall a principle that is exactly the opposite of aggression, namely the right of self-defense. Some people mention the right of the defender to fire first, a right recognized by all criminal laws. Some say: when threatened by aggression, a country has the right to attack first to defend itself, even if the other country has not taken actual aggressive action. Some say: there may be such a conflict in which there is no aggressor, and both countries have no intention of aggression or self-defense. It is said: if two countries want to resolve their disputes through war, then neither of them is acting in self-defense, and therefore, in this case, there is no aggressor.

Here we have three situations worth discussing. Of course, in the first situation, the country taking self-defense measures is undoubtedly correct; in the second situation, the conflict between the two parties is undoubtedly without aggression, and there is no indication of aggression. There is no declaration of war by one country against another, nor is there an invasion of one country's territory by the armed forces of another. Thus, there is no question of aggression. All these situations, of course, should be determined by the authorized international organizations to make decisions on these events.

As for the third situation, where both countries want to resolve their disputes through war, some conclude that in this case there is no aggressor. We cannot agree with this conclusion.

On the same issue, U.S. Secretary of State Cordell Hull said in 1932: the signatory countries of the Kellogg-Briand Pact are opposed to war between nations. This means that war has been declared illegal worldwide. It no longer has a legal status; it is no longer the key to determining people's behavior and rights. It has become an illegal thing. Therefore, when two countries are at war, both parties are guilty and are violators of the law defined by this pact. Other countries no longer need to distinguish between them or treat them according to the rules of dueling; on the contrary, other countries regard them as lawbreakers.

The U.S. Attorney General said in a speech on March 27, 1941: considering that many countries have undertaken international obligations not to use war as a tool of policy, he emphasized: the anti-war treaties and the Argentine anti-war pact deprive the signatory countries of the right to use war as a tool of policy or aggression, and declare that wars launched in violation of the provisions of these treaties are illegal. Therefore, these treaties have destroyed the historical and legal basis of neutrality, which has always been absolute in aggressive wars.

It can be seen that a country that launches a war and thus violates its obligations has no right to demand that other countries treat it equally, unless the treaties stipulate that the problem should be solved in another way. Such a country, due to its illegal act, does not enjoy this right.

This is the so-called criticism of the Soviet draft definition of "aggression." This is not criticism but a blatant distortion of facts under the guise of criticism.

Those who vehemently oppose a clear definition of aggression, such as the one drafted by the Soviet Union, even propose a strange theory, suggesting: since there is no indisputable standard for defining aggression, the opinions of various governments on this issue must be based on impressions obtained from various different facts. They call this theory the "natural concept of aggression," which, they say, can and must be interpreted differently at different times and under different conditions. In other words, all the objective standards that can be used as the basis for defining aggression and aggressors ultimately depend on the individual opinions or arbitrary will of each government involved.

Such a theory is very convenient for governments that carry out aggressive policies. Naturally, such a theory also allows these countries to obtain a very "flexible" definition of aggression, so flexible that it undermines the possibility of defining aggression and nullifies the entire importance of the international definition of aggression, or renders it completely ineffective. This definition could have been used as a basis for measures to limit and oppose true aggressors.

In this matter, it is the U.S. ruling class that is pulling the strings.

U.S. foreign policy has shifted from cooperation to the cold war—the prelude to another world war. The U.S. is not concerned with suppressing aggressors and thwarting the aggressive plans of war mongers but with clearing obstacles from the path to another world war. The U.S. reactionary clique and the reactionary cliques in certain countries supporting them are preparing for such a world war to complete the mad plans of U.S. billionaires and their accomplices in other countries.

The attitude of the U.S. and British representatives towards the definition of aggression can only be said to be an attempt to prevent the conference from adopting a definition of aggression that can play a truly significant role in stopping this most dangerous international crime. The stance of the U.S. and Britain is not accidental. This stance is directly related to the basic economic laws of modern capitalism.

Stalin, in his recent great work "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR," proves that the main characteristics and requirements of the basic economic law of modern capitalism are: "to ensure the maximum capitalist profit by exploiting the majority of the population of one's own country and making them bankrupt and impoverished, by enslaving and continually plundering the peoples of other countries, especially backward countries, and by wars aimed at ensuring the highest profits and the militarization of the national economy." This economic law forces monopoly capitalism to organize new wars to squeeze out the highest profits and seize world economic hegemony and world political hegemony.

The specific characteristics of monopoly capitalism also determine the essence and specific characteristics of its international policy. This policy leads to a struggle among the great powers to divide up the world's economic and political territories. Its specific characteristics are manifested in the efforts to use threats, seize new territories, colonies, and markets. The development of the modern international situation proves that various kinds of capitalist alliances that are being established or are already in operation are organized on the basis of dividing up the world's economic territories. The relations among countries are also based on the division of the world's territories and the struggle for colonies and markets. This, in turn, deepens the contradictions among capitalist countries; J.V. Stalin proves that the struggle among capitalist countries for markets between the First and Second World Wars was more intense in practice than the contradictions within the capitalist camp and the socialist camp.

Marxism-Leninism teaches us that alliances in the capitalist world, regardless of the form they take, whether it is one imperialist bloc against another, such as the Allied Powers against the Triple Alliance, or the general alliance of all imperialist countries, are in fact only the "intermission" between two wars.

Marxism-Leninism teaches us: "Alliances in peacetime prepare the basis for war, and wars also arise from alliances; the two are mutually causal. Such alliances create the alternating forms of peaceful and non-peaceful struggle, which arise from the same basis, namely the imperialist connection and the world economic and political relations."—Lenin.

Of course, we cannot delve deeply into this issue here. However, what has been said is sufficient to fully explain the source of the stance taken by the representatives of the Atlantic aggression bloc countries. Although these countries have differing views due to the special features of their economic, financial, and political situations, they unanimously oppose the definition of aggression. The adoption of such a definition of aggression by the United Nations would be a great obstacle to the realization of their aggressive plans and would deprive them of their weapons of war. The adoption of such a definition by the United Nations General Assembly would provide all sincere supporters of peace with another weapon to oppose the launch of a new world war.

Of course, no one will be deceived by these grandiose speeches about peace and the self-proclaimed hope to eliminate the threat of another world war that are pouring out like a flood from the imperialist camp.

The entire history of war, especially the history of war in the past century, clearly shows the true causes and purposes of wars among capitalist countries. At the same time, the history of war exposes certain countries as war-loving and often unwilling to resolve the issues that cause disputes among their ruling classes.

On this point, even bourgeois scientists like the famous French international law expert Professor Fauchille see it clearly. In his book "International Law," he discusses the causes of the various wars of the 19th century and cites several different wars as examples of the true causes. For example: "The pretext for the war against Denmark in 1864 was the succession of the Duke of Augustenburg and the rights claimed by the German Confederation. The real cause of the war was Prussia's desire to expand its territory."

"The pretext for the Franco-Prussian War of 1870 was the insult to the French representative, which was contained in a slanderous telegram. This telegram, as Bismarck himself admitted, was drafted in Berlin by him, the Minister of War, and Marshal Moltke, with the aim of stirring up the emotions of the Germans and the French. The real cause of the war was Prussia's desire to unify Germany under Prussian hegemony through joint military action."

It is known that the era of imperialist wars began with the Spanish-American War, the purpose of which was obviously to seize Cuba and the Philippines.

The famous scientist Velt in his 1913 book "Modern World History" devoted a chapter to "The Cuban War," in which he wrote about the United States: "At the beginning, the Americans loudly proclaimed the equality of all peoples and proclaimed their pursuit of an ideal nation full of peace and prosperity. After a long process, they reached the conclusion that the inequality of peoples is unchangeable, and finally they adopted the policy of conquest by force. They initially advocated freedom for everything, free trade, free relations with each other, and tolerance for other beliefs, races, and countries. In the end, they implemented the most ferocious protectionist tariff policies, increasingly hostile attitudes towards Catholics, and resolute aggression against other nations and foreign countries."

The French scientist Dreux in his 1900 work "Political Problems" wrote: "Therefore, the war against Cuba was an economic war, because the purpose of this war was to seize the sugar market of this island country; similarly, the United States' annexation of the Hawaiian Islands and the Philippines was to seize the coffee and sugar produced by these tropical countries."

"Therefore, the seizure of markets and the plundering of tropical products—this is the basic cause of the colonial expansion policy called imperialism. And all these colonies are also excellent strategic bases, the importance of which we will discuss later... to also ensure their Asian markets... they need supporting bases."

Incidentally, many scientific historical works discuss the U.S. intervention in Cuba.

When the United States fought Spain for Cuba, it advocated so-called "freedom" and the "liberation" of Cuba, but as can be seen from the above, the true cause of the war was entirely different—it was purely due to the material and selfish interests of American imperialists.

When the United States annexed the Philippines, it promised freedom to the Philippines. But who does not know that the American conquerors shamelessly deceived the Philippine leader Aguinaldo, and at the same time, out of the same desire for conquest, they suppressed the Philippine people in the same way.

Italy invaded Abyssinia in 1935 and occupied it. Germany and Italy intervened militarily in Spain in 1936, with Germany invading northern Spain and Spanish Morocco, and Italy invading southern Spain and the Balearic Islands. Japan, after occupying northeastern China, invaded North China and Central China in 1937, occupying Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai. Hitler's Germany occupied Austria in 1938 and the Sudetenland of Czechoslovakia in the fall of 1938. Japan occupied Guangzhou in 1938 and Hainan Island in early 1939.

In the face of all these acts of aggression, the League of Nations proved to be powerless and unable to take corresponding measures against the aggressors. All these acts of aggression show that the ruling forces in the League of Nations did not fulfill their responsibility to prevent aggression, just as the leading core of the United Nations, the North Atlantic bloc countries, are now not fulfilling their responsibilities because they refuse to end the war of aggression against Korea and refuse to stop torturing this brave small country.

The issue of aggression and the necessary definition of aggression that follows is both urgent and important today, and the definition of aggression should be the guiding principle for the Security Council in its activities to counter possible aggression. The contradictions among capitalist countries have produced the threat of war, and these contradictions, especially the contradictions between the major capitalist countries—the United States and Britain—have not only not been eliminated but have become more intense, taking the form of open struggles for markets, raw materials, especially strategic raw materials—rubber, non-ferrous metals, rare metals, oil, etc.

Not only have the contradictions between the United States and Britain become more acute, but the contradictions between the United States and Japan, the United States and Italy, the United States and West Germany have also become more acute. The contradictions within the capitalist camp will soon become even more intense. American imperialists have been waging war against the Korean people for more than two years, the increasing militarization of the national economies of capitalist countries, and the surge of national liberation movements in colonies and dependent countries have further exposed the disintegration of the imperialist colonial system and the intensification of new contradictions that follow.

Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers Malenkov said in his recent report that the current international situation shows that American imperialists are infiltrating the colonies and spheres of influence of colonial countries like Britain, France, and Belgium; they are seizing territories for themselves, plotting against their British and French "allies," and using the territories of many colonies and dependent countries (Egypt, Iran, Syria, Morocco, Tunisia, etc.) as military bases, and year after year intensifying preparations for future world war.

Under these circumstances, measures such as disarmament and demobilization, the prohibition of atomic weapons, the cessation of the use of inhumane bacteriological weapons, and the clear definition of aggression to restrain all countries are completely against their wishes. All these measures, in the eyes of the leaders of the North Atlantic bloc, are quite dangerous.

They are doing everything they can to avoid this "danger," using various reasons and fabricated laws to cover up their stance.

Despite the efforts to oppose the important task of giving a powerful definition to the term "aggression" so that the relevant organs of the United Nations can use it to resist aggression, the Sixth Session still correctly recognized: although the crime of aggression can be judged according to the specific circumstances of each case, for the sake of ensuring international law and security and promoting international criminal law, it is not only possible but also beneficial to determine its definition based on the components of aggression. The session drew attention to the fact that the definition of aggression will certainly be useful in the future when drafting instructions for the international organization responsible for determining who the aggressor is.

Based on these considerations, the Sixth Session decided to include the issue of defining the term "aggression" in the agenda of the Seventh Session.

The definition of aggression proposed by the Soviet Union is essentially the same as the definition drafted by the Security Council in 1933 based on the Soviet proposal of February 6, 1933.

The definition of aggression proposed by the Soviet Union is also fully recognized in the theory of international law. This can be found in the works of famous bourgeois jurists such as Bella, Calogero, and Cosentini. These jurists, when studying the responsibility of states for international crimes, all start from the definition of aggression proposed by the Soviet Union in 1933. Calogero wrote in 1934: "We can say that the London Convention (i.e., the Convention on the Definition of Aggression—Editor) laid the foundation for a new legal order, for any lasting peace, which is a necessary condition." The historical significance of this law is undoubted, because, as we have already pointed out, it is also the basis for many international treaties on this issue. I must cite the report of the Security Council on this law, although this report is already twenty years old. The report points out: the law embodied in this document is the foundation of the entire security system planned by the Disarmament Conference, which eliminates doubts and disputes about whether a country that resorts to force is an attacker. The report points out: in this way, countries can know in advance what they cannot do to avoid being considered the attacking side or aggressor, even if international organizations do not intervene. Such a definition is valuable. It will make the prohibition on the use of force more authoritative and give public opinion and other countries more confidence in judging whether this prohibition is being observed.

The report points out: when someone asks an international organization to determine the true attacking side in a conflict, if there is a clear definition in concept that these organizations can apply, then they will find it easier to point out who the attacker is, and they will not give the impression that the applied rules have been broken, nor will they cover up and justify the attacking side for political reasons.

The same report of the Security Council emphasizes the importance of drafting a definition by listing the factors that constitute aggression.

If we study the lessons of history, it will be proven that the position of the First Session of the United Nations was equally correct, because history proves: aggressors have always tried to portray themselves as the defensive side, or use excuses such as: the other party has infringed upon their rights and interests or created a situation that threatens their security. They do this to cover up their aggression with such or similar tricks. The organizers of aggressive wars, when launching wars, have always said that they are completely for self-defense. There are countless examples of this kind of thing that are well known, and we only need to mention a few.

The judgment of the Tokyo International Military Tribunal states: one of the leaders of Japanese militarism, General Arisugawa, when calling for the preparation of an aggressive war, said that the purpose was only national self-defense, to establish order in chaos and to create an ideal world and paradise in the Far East.

In Arisugawa's view, Japan's defense was not limited to defending the Japanese mainland but also to defending what they called the "Imperial Way" (the road to conquer other countries and bring them into the so-called "co-prosperity sphere").

At the same time, the infamous Tanaka Memorial—Japan's secret report on foreign policy issues presented by Premier General Tanaka to the Japanese Emperor in 1927—also proves this. Everyone knows that this memorial directly demands war against the Soviet Union and the United States, and this demand is made under the guise of Japan's vital interests and the inevitability of such a war.

The judgment of the Nuremberg Tribunal proves that the Hitler gang also used the excuse of German defense and the need for so-called "living space" to justify their armed occupation of other countries' territories.

There are countless such examples. However, the few examples cited are sufficient to clearly show the correctness of the proposal included in the definition of aggression proposed by the Soviet delegation in its motion to the session.

As stated in the preamble of the motion of the Soviet delegation, the definition of aggression must become the guiding principle for the actions of the international organization responsible for determining which party has committed the crime of aggression.

Such an understanding of the role of the definition of aggression is in accordance with the resolution of the Sixth Session of the United Nations, which determines that the definition of aggression must become an instruction guiding the actions of the international organization responsible for pointing out who the aggressor is.

An extremely important factor in defining aggression is to recognize this principle: any country, regardless of the pretext or motive, as long as it first launches a war, that is, first takes any of the actions listed in the definition, must be declared an aggressor and held responsible for all the consequences that follow.

It can be seen that such an interpretation of the standard of the aggressor is the most obvious and the only possible standard, which is the basis of a definition that has long been recognized in international law.

The fact that a country first took the actions listed in the first section of the definition is an important prerequisite for determining that these actions are acts of aggression.

Such a solution to the problem is completely in accordance with the objectives and tasks of the United Nations as stipulated in the Charter.

So, if a country first takes action against another country or other countries, what actions can be considered acts of aggression?

These actions are: declaring war on another country; even without declaring war, invading the territory of another country with armed forces; attacking the territory of another country with an army, navy, or air force, or deliberately attacking the navy or air force of another country; without the permission of the government of another country, or violating the conditions of such permission, especially the duration of stay or the scope of the area, landing or advancing into the territory of that country with an army, navy, or air force; blockading the coast or ports of another country with a navy; finally, supporting armed bandits who organize on its territory and then invade the territory of another country, or refusing to take all measures within its power to cancel the assistance or protection obtained by these bandits, despite the request of the invaded country, on its own territory.

The second and third sections of the draft definition of aggression proposed by the Soviet Union are also very important, and I believe this does not require special explanation.

Finally, the Soviet delegation draws the following conclusions:

1. It is entirely possible to define aggression. This has been proven by historical experience—the Soviet Union once proposed a definition of aggression. And the eleven international conventions concluded by the Soviet Union with some countries from July 3 to July 5, 1933, and some other international agreements, all include this definition.

2. The definition of aggression is useful. The conventions that include the above definition and become the basis for friendly relations between the Soviet Union and other countries have opened the way for peaceful cooperation between them.

3. The definition of aggression is necessary. Because it can serve as a guiding principle for an authorized international organization in studying issues of international armed conflict. It can serve as a guiding principle for the Security Council in applying Article 39 and other articles of Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter.

4. The definition of aggression is necessary and useful in the current dangerous international situation, because it is an important tool with which to facilitate the struggle against aggression and aggressors, and against unjust wars of plunder and enslavement of foreign countries and peoples.

The Soviet delegation firmly supports its proposal to define aggression and calls on all other country delegations to support this proposal, because this proposal is in the vital interests of all peace-loving countries and is in the interests of maintaining and strengthening peace and eliminating the threat of another world war.

    维辛斯基十一月二十一日在联大法律委员会上关于侵略定义问题的演说
    一、侵略定义在争取和平与国际安全的斗争中的重要性
    侵略定义问题有它自己的历史。
    这个问题在第二次世界大战以前的时期内曾引起了人们的注意，特别是在关于国际联盟的活动方面。以后，从联合国成立的初期以来，这个问题也引起了人们的注意。侵略问题与另外一个国际法和国际政策上的最重要的问题——集体安全问题——有着必然密切的联系，这当然不是一件偶然的事情。集体安全问题的本身又是与废除军备问题或者至少与裁减军备问题有着必然密切的联系。
    在开始重新讨论“侵略”的定义这个问题时，我当然不得不先追述一下这个问题的历史，回忆一下它的最重要的特征，回顾一下它已经经历过的道路。例如，我们不能不追述一个事实：早在一九二七年，那时正是国际联盟时代，曾在筹备委员会的第四次会议上成立了一个特别的所谓“仲裁与安全委员会”，这个委员会曾花了两年的时间为“侵略”下定义，并获得了某些成就，但是因为它遭遇了西方各大国在它的工作道路上所安置的种种障碍，它未曾能够胜利地完成它的工作。
    在这方面的其他几次努力也遭到同样的命运。
    早在一九三三年，苏联代表团曾在裁军会议上提醒大家注意这种情形，当时苏联代表团指出：从事拟订各种安全与裁减军备草案的委员会与会议，都是在来回地兜圈子，并且我还要说，是在一个恶性的圈子里兜；它们只管来回地兜着圈子，丝毫不保证参加这些委员会和会议的国家的政府在实际上打破这种恶性的圈子，而走上一条足以使国际和平安全问题这样重要的国际关系问题获得肯定解决的康庄大道。
    造成这种反常情况的一个原因是：西欧主要国家希望在保证国际安全和裁减军备——更不必说普遍废除军备——的方案的掩盖下，准备一些措施，得以把有关上述问题的国际协定变成对付苏联的武器，这一点是可以被认为绝对不容置辩的。这是那时的一切从事于安全和废除军备的国际会议与各种委员会所一贯追求的总方针。
    德国再度在历史舞台上出现了；它的军国主义和侵略政策曾受到美、英、法三国的广泛支持，这三国曾解开了法西斯德国所受到的约束，为德国的侵略廓清了道路。西方三国拒绝苏联在一九三六年建议的集体安全公约，这说明它们不愿反击日益增长的希特勒侵略威胁。希特勒德国在美英法三国那种态度的鼓励下，愈来愈大胆，并坚决走上了军国主义化与广泛地发展军事工业的道路。大量的美元培植了德国战争工业并滋养了德国的侵略。在美、英、法三国反动集团的鼓励与帮助下，德国准备侵略战争的活动一年比一年加强，美、英、法三国反动集团的政策不是反对德国侵略，而是孤立苏联、使德国侵略向东发展，侵略苏联。
    苏联提出的和平建议与裁军草案显然是与这种引起德国军国主义者和复仇主义者的欲望的政策不能相容的。因此，苏联所有的草案与建议都在绥靖主义的宣言与具有可疑的和平意义的国际协定的喧嚷声中被拒绝了。一九二八年拼凑成功的臭名远扬的白里安—凯洛格公约，便是这种国际协定的一个例子。
    白里安—凯洛格公约在表面上规定反对以战争作为国家政策的工具，但是在实际上，它的目的是要成为孤立与打击苏联的一个武器；苏联在当时就已指出了它的用意与目的。一九二七年国际联盟发表笼统的声明说：“侵略战争决不能作为解决国际纠纷的手段，因此，它是一种国际罪行。”凯洛格公约根据这个声明，宣布它的所谓目的是禁止战争，但是实际上这个文件远不能实现它所宣布的那个目的。这个公约有很多缺点，这些缺点主要是英国对这个公约所作的保留所造成的。英国的保留的性质与意义是很清楚的。苏联外交人民委员部一九二八年八月三十一日的照会中指出，这些保留只能被认为是“想利用公约作为帝国主义政策的工具的一个企图”。
    苏联政府在它的照会中指出：必须禁止国际间的一切战争，特别是禁止目的在于镇压民族解放运动的战争，以及干涉、封锁、军事占领外国领土、外国港口等行动。苏联外交人民委员部在答复要求苏联同意凯洛格公约的建议的照会中说：“近年来的历史上已有了好几次这种给许多国家的人民带来巨大灾难的战争。好几个苏维埃共和国曾经是这种攻击的对象，目前四亿中国人民正遭受着这种攻击。而且，这种冲突时常发展为绝对不可能制止的战争。”
    苏联政府虽然看到了白里安—凯洛格公约的制订者的一切隐秘的计划以及这个公约的所有的重大缺点，然而还是同意签订了这个公约，因为苏联政府考虑到这个公约客观上“使签字国对舆论负有某些义务，并使苏联政府能有机会向公约各签字国提出一个与和平有着重大关系的问题，就是裁军问题，这个问题的解决是防止战争的唯一保证。”
    大家都知道，白里安—凯洛格公约并没有防止战争贩子对苏联进行无数次挑衅行动。
    为了保证白里安—凯洛格公约在最大的程度上付诸实施，并使专门为了保证公约的签字国履行它们所承担的义务而成立的机构的确能发生最大的作用起见，必须使这个机构获得相应的行动的准则。这就需要对侵略下一定义，下一个区别进攻和自卫的定义，揭露进攻一方——即侵略者——为了辩解他们的进攻通常使用的骗人遁辞。苏联在一九三三年就“侵略”一词提出历史性的定义，正是为了这一目的。
    苏联政府在提出侵略的定义的时候，已清楚地看到它将遭遇的困难。就在一九三三年，苏联政府已指出：它预料得到法律专家及其他专家对这个定义可能提出些什么反对理由和评语。它估计有些人会指出：不可能给进攻下一个绝对的定义，实际上可能发生定义中所未规定的情况，同时很难确定何方首先进攻他国——而这却是最重要的一个问题。
    我们知道这种预见是非常正确的。在将近二十五年来，我们不断地听到这种反对苏联定义的理由。最使人遗憾的是，我们听到的理由却老是那一套，不过是翻来覆去地提出而已，这些理由的贫乏已不止一次地受到驳斥并使大家看到了它们的真正目的。而在今天，在一九五二年，反对我们的定义的人又在重复他们的前辈在一九三三年老早已经说过的话，一点也没有能使他们的论据更具有说服力。我们当时就着重指出：我们并没有自以为下了一个绝对的定义，特别是因为我们知道根本无所谓绝对的定义，而且也不可能有什么绝对的定义。没有一个定义，即使是最完善的定义，能够包括生活所有的演变和非常事件的多种多样性。没有什么国际法律和国内法律可以规定这样的目的。但是，这一点将在以后更详细地讨论。
    苏联在一九三三年提出的侵略定义中概述了在下侵略定义时应该遵守的基本原则，并强调指出，在做这件工作时的任务是设法使安全问题获得这样的一种解决办法，即——如苏联政府所说——这种解决办法不会成为外交角逐的目标，并且不仅对强国有利，而且对弱小国家也有利。
    显然，这个建议的通过对于解决国际冲突可以发生重大的意义，但必须有一个条件，那就是：要同意这个定义的各国诚实地、一贯地、客观地、公正地应用关于侵略定义的国际协定，就是说，要这些国家随时随地遵守它们所同意的原则，而不是按照像美国代表在第六届大会和目前在此所说的某种“印象”；要这些国家遵守这个规定侵略定义的原则，不得根据美国代表所说的印象；要这些国家严格遵守它们所缔结的国际协定中包括的定义和决议，不得根据“每一个有关国家的单独意见”怎样形成的情况。
    但是，我们必须指出，美国、英国以及高唱各种直觉的、心理的和其他类似论调的其他国家的代表们在实际上否认了这些条件。
    我们在这里已经谈过的历史说明，西方国家在签订白里安—凯洛格公约之类的条约并在讨论中吵吵嚷嚷地批评关于规定侵略定义的建议，企图证明这种定义是不可能产生的，但同时却与并不掩饰侵略意图的其他国家狼狈为奸。一九三三年的情况就是这样。那时，英德法意四国在罗马签订了所谓“四强公约”。那个公约只体现了那时的英法政府与德、意两国法西斯主义的狼狈为奸，其目的在于破坏反对侵略国家的爱好和平国家阵线。这种协定对于那些想就反侵略斗争的措施获致谅解的爱好和平的努力是一个打击，这种爱好和平的努力是想取得一致的意见，对于有责任反对侵略的国际机构给予关于反对侵略的指导方针，借以便利反侵略斗争。
    所以在那时，一方面是苏联的反侵略建议，另一方面是为侵略者敞开大门的四国公约。因此，苏联政府尽管设法防止侵略战争危险的到来，然而这种努力会遭到什么结果是十分明显的。后来的局势发展证实了这个最可悲的假定：苏联的崇高努力失败了。为了要更好地了解那时发生的、对于防止侵略战争的任何措施的通过极端不利的国际局势，我们决不能忘记像一九二九年起至一九三三年年底终止的严重经济危机之类的事情，那次危机影响了许多资本主义国家，尤其是美国，加剧了它们之间的矛盾，并导致远东战争温床的形成；白里安—凯洛格公约不能防止战争的危险，也不能丝毫缓和它。
    国际联盟只能通过一些模糊不清的决议，那些决议实际上鼓励了日本采取进一步的侵略行动。一九三三年二月，英国外交大臣西门在下院为日本的侵略进行辩护，终于使中国东北被日本占领。美国又支持国际联盟行政院任命的李顿调查团的建议，并且在调查了日中冲突的原因和性质后，还承认日本在中国的那个地区内的“特别权利和利益”。与此同时，还有日益加强的激烈宣传，这种宣传公然号召对苏作战，并得到罗马教皇的支持。一九三二年的国际形势，也就是苏联政府还没有提出规定侵略定义的建议时的国际形势，被认为是“事实上的战争状态”，这个战争虽然没有登记和经过公证人证明，但事实上它是在距离欧洲很远的一片广大土地上进行着的。
    在那时，英美两国没有尽一点力量来帮助解决中日冲突。这个冲突只是代表了日本帝国主义者侵略中国的行为。在那时，英美两国并采取了一种支持希特勒的侵略政策的态度，当时希特勒已开始进行他的掠夺计划，恫吓不幸的英美政策的领袖们，并且自命为使全世界不受“世界布尔什维主义”影响的救主。
    那时正是各资本主义国家内疯狂地准备另一次重新瓜分世界、划分势力范围的战争的时候；那时，整军和扩军势力胜过了和平势力，两个对抗的资本主义阵营都集中力量于整军和扩军。
    那时，法西斯侵略的威胁愈来愈笼罩着全世界。整个世界对于德国内部的发展情形和希特勒的外交阴谋都感到惊慌，希特勒的外交企图用爱好和平的声明作幌子，来掩盖希特勒分子正在准备的对邻国的进攻。
    至于那时西欧的其他资本主义国家，它们的政策是把沙文主义和准备战争作为它们外交政策的基本要素，在内政方面以镇压工人阶级和实行恐怖手段作为巩固将来作战时后方的必要手段。
    这是苏联政府元首斯大林在一九三四年对于西欧资本主义国家的外交政策的一个卓越的、正确的、适当的描写，这个描写指出“作为摆脱现状的出路的新帝国主义战争是日益逼近了。”虽然，如斯大林所说的，这样也没有理由使人假定战争真正可以提供出路；战争只能使形势更加恶化。
    二、美英统治集团阻挠制定侵略定义的行为
    当时的国际形势就是这样。因此，苏联政府就在一九三三年二月裁军会议上提出了制定关于裁军与普遍安全的权威性指导原则的问题，提出了关于侵略定义的历史性建议。这个建议列举了一切国家应该保证视为侵略行为的行动，及一切国家应该保证遵行以防止侵略并巩固和平的行动。
    英国代表在十一月十九日的发言中不愿提到所有这一切，他反对对侵略下任何定义，理由是：这样的定义制止不了侵略者，只会使被侵略者受到损害。他谈到一九一四年德国进攻比利时、一九三九年希特勒匪帮进攻波兰、一九三一年及一九三七年日本侵略者进攻中国东北，墨索里尼进攻阿比西尼亚等事件。他指出这些事实是各种侵略的典型例子，他说：侵略定义对所有这些事件都不会发生任何影响。他列举了这些例子想证明在所有这些事件中，侵略定义不会给被侵略者以任何保障。但是这种逻辑是经不起一击的。如果那些承担义务、保证要遵守防止罪行的法律的政府首先违背它们的义务，破坏这些法律的话，那么任何定义、公约或最严格的国际法都不能防止犯罪，这是很自然的事。英国代表提出的历史事例证明了他要证明的东西的反面。
    我们现在不可能把英国代表所提出的所有事例全都加以分析。但只要把他所提到的墨索里尼进攻阿比西尼亚的事件分析一下就很够了。墨索里尼在全世界众目睽睽之下进行了进攻阿比西尼亚的准备。阿比西尼亚向国际联盟要求保护与帮助都归于无效。意大利军队进占了阿比西尼亚。法国代表赖伐尔与英国代表霍尔说要对侵略者实行制裁，但是实际上并没有以任何方式阻止墨索里尼执行他的掠夺计划。只有苏联政府要求国际联盟会员国不要规避它们根据国际联盟盟约所承担的义务。莫洛托夫当时代表苏联政府说：“只有苏联对意阿战争采取了区别于任何帝国主义，区别于任何殖民侵略政策的特别的原则立场。只有苏联声明它按照阿比西尼亚——何况它还是国际联盟的会员国——具有平等权利与独立的原则行事，它不能支持国际联盟或个别资本主义国家破坏这种独立与平等权利的任何行动。”
    以后的一切事态仅仅是加强了罗马—柏林的法西斯“轴心”。
    英美代表应该牢记这些事情，而不应该离开本题，诽谤苏联对芬兰与波罗的海苏维埃社会主义共和国的政策或北朝鲜政府对美国侵略朝鲜所采取的政策。
    由于西欧的主要国家——英国和法国——采取了这种立场，那时的国际局势的演变对战争贩子非常有利。在这种局势下，所有爱好和平的人民就非常必须取得协议；他们必须同意用怎样的措施来防止战争威胁，用怎样的措施来抵抗侵略，并在规定何种行动为侵略行动以及谴责采取这种行动的国家为侵略者的问题上取得共同的意见。
    曾发言反对规定侵略定义的委内瑞拉代表，引证了一种说法作为辩解他的观点的论据，他说：在国际局势严重的情况下，不可能指望完满地确定侵略的定义。在我们看来，正是因为国际局势严重，充满了侵略战争的威胁，所以才需要竭力消除这种严重的情况，消除即将爆发的侵略的威胁。这正是那些力求在侵略的定义方面达成协议从而使安全理事会掌握争取和平的工具的国家所追求的目的。
    在委内瑞拉代表看来，这个问题就恰恰相反。他认为在国际局势严重的情况下，便不应采取任何措施来改变这种局势。
    这位代表根据这种论据就得出结论说：正是由于目前的国际局势，所以不便于确定侵略的定义。他认为应把这件事交给安全理事会处置，照他所说，安全理事会将“直觉地”“根据常识”来决定这个问题，就跟一个人猿一样，因为委内瑞拉代表告诉我们说：一个人猿遭到石击的时候也能很清楚地知道什么叫做侵略。
    这就是继续主张反对通过侵略的定义的当代怀疑派的哲学所得到的结论。有些国家在这个问题上已经顽固地坚持它们这种主张达二十多年，而这些国家——英国、美国、比利时、希腊、瑞典和其他某些国家——现在仍在反对我们的定义。
    说到这里，我愿追述一下在一九二三年成立的临时联合委员会的特别委员会的工作，它的工作就是对确定侵略事件的问题提出意见。临时联合委员会在报告中公然声明：在现代战争方式的情况下，即使在理论上确定侵略事件都是不可能的。
    大家知道，联合委员会那时拒绝了对侵略下定义的办法。
    那时，规定“侵略”定义的问题被否决了，而把这个问题限于国际联盟大会第三委员会在一九三三年准备的一个共同援助条约草案内，这个共同援助条约草案把侵略的整个定义缩小成这样一句话，即：任何侵略战争是一种国际罪行。但是，这完全不是它的任务，它的任务应该是确定什么样的战争是侵略性的，换句话说，就是确定侵略的主要征象。那个草案并说：某种战争不是侵略性的，但是它也没有明确地指出什么战争是侵略性的。
    而且，在对侵略下定义表示不赞成的基础上制定了一个原则，这个原则的本身就是不正确的，它是与规定侵略定义的真正任务不相符合的。
    这个原则规定：假如纠纷的一方是一个接受了国际联盟行政院的一致建议，接受了国际永久法庭的决定或仲裁决定的一个国家，这个国家对不接受这种建议的对方进行的战争就不得认为是侵略性的。因此，非侵略性的战争就是国际联盟行政院、国际永久法庭或者一个仲裁决定所认为不是侵略性的战争。因此，上述的国际联盟各机构的大多数可以随意处理一切事情，说得更确切一点，国际联盟各机构的大多数可以专断处理，或所谓仲裁一切事情。
    这并没有消除这样一个危险，即：根据某一集团的利益通过决议，或是由某些竞争集团之间干脆作出一个密谋。
    当苏联代表团在一九三三年二月六日向总务委员会提出它的确定侵略意义的草案时，曾遭到许多国家的代表们的强烈反对。例如，艾登先生曾坚持说：确定侵略意义问题，并不是一个能代表参加裁军会议的任何国家的民族利益的问题。
    艾登先生说：这个问题似乎是一个纯粹科学问题，各国对这个问题的利益都是相同的。我们不能同意这种看法，因为确定侵略意义问题是外交政策上的一个十分重要而尖锐的问题，是一个具有非常实际利益的问题。
    艾登先生一九三三年五月二十五日在裁减和限制军备会议上发表的演说中，曾反对波里蒂斯主持的委员会根据苏联建议所准备的草案，苏联的建议说：这个计划是很简单的、无伸缩性的，并且说，不需要有一个世界各国签字的正式文件来保证这样的一个结果，即：承认第一个发动进攻的国家为侵略者。
    英国代表指出：委员会提出的侵略定义在十分简单的事件中大概会发生令人满意的作用。但是在这种事件中一般是不需要定义的。至于在确定侵略定义问题绝顶重要的疑难事件中，照艾登先生看来，这种定义不但是否有好处尚属疑问，并且很明显地是有害的。
    这种说法的根据是对苏联建议的完全武断的曲解，他并不研究建议的本质，而是把苏联建议，像艾登先生所说的那样，解释成为一种绝对死板、机械运用的定义，说这个定义只取决于一个事实：纠纷的两造那一方首先作出明文规定的行为之一。
    但是这种说法的理由是极不充分的。英国代表在一九三三年裁军会议主要委员会讨论侵略问题时说：在国际局势紧张期间，当双方军队都集结边境，冲突随时可以发生的时候，人们可以肯定地说，双方军队中那一方面首先越过边境的问题是比较具有次要意义的，因为必须按照以往的事实来确定两个国家中那一个是真正的侵略者。
    诚然，在进攻以前的事实是具有重大意义的，在许多事件中，这些事实甚至具有确定谁是侵略者的决定意义。
    但是在苏联提出的关于侵略一词的定义中，并没有说在处理侵略的问题时用不着提到先前的事实。这正是安全理事会的直接的职责，按照联合国宪章第三十九条，它应该确定那种行动是侵略行动，并建议采取何种措施来维持或恢复国际和平及安全。苏联草案中断定，首先采取草案中所提到的那种行动的国家，应被视为国际冲突中的侵略者，然而这并不是说在审查整个问题的时候，只限于确定这一个事实，因为草案原文后面跟着说得很明白，需要讨论的问题是：这一个国家一定是下列各种情况的一种：首先对他国宣战、其武装部队首先进攻他国领土、首先轰炸他国领土或首先袭击他国船只、飞机等等。
    三、美国和英国反对确定“侵略”的定义
    差不多在二十年以后，英国出席联合国第七届大会第六委员会的代表费兹摩利斯先生仍然坚持同一观点，硬说由于国际关系目前的情况、以及他所说的现代战争方法以及现代侵略技术，确定侵略的定义不但没有什么用处而且是很危险的。
    他的意见和艾登先生前些时候所发表的意见相同，认为目前不宜确定侵略的定义。
    然而这位英国代表在十一月十九日的发言中并未明确说明为什么现在就不宜于确定侵略的定义；他也未说明使得我们无法确定侵略定义并使确定侵略定义成为一种有害而危险的行动的究竟是那些近代战争方法和那些近代侵略技术。侵略就是侵略，也就是进攻，不论采取了那种战争方法，也不论采取了那种进攻技术，反正这并不妨碍确定侵略定义的任务，也并不妨碍我们根据历史年鉴中所记录下来的许多战争的经验来指出侵略的特点。英国代表拚命要使人相信确定侵略定义没有什么好处，说这种工作充满阴谋和危险，想要证明委员会在道义上没有劝告大会接受侵略的定义的权利。他说：他的政府根据本国成功地抗御侵略的长期经验，深信一个定义并不能阻挡侵略者，却只能成为被侵略者的
    一种障碍。
    说到英国在第二次世界大战以前的经验，那并不能证明英国统治集团具有抵抗侵略的经验。这种经验恰好证明完全相反的一面。我们可以追忆一下张伯伦与达拉第在一九三三年与希特勒和墨索里尼签订的鼓励德、意法西斯主义侵略计划的四强公约；我们还可以追忆另一个在英国帮助下签订的条约，这就是在德国侵略的准备工作中占重要地位的希特勒与波兰在一九三四年签订的德波互不侵犯条约；此外还有许多人人熟知的同样的事实。
    因此，如果这种经验就是他们的根据，那么指望英国的代表们对确定侵略的定义的事情表示同情，自然是会落空的。
    在我看来，美国代表参议员格伦较为符合事实。他说，关于抵制侵略的规则和措施，在英美两国历史上还找不出实际的经验，因此，在应用侵略规则方面没有足够的经验。不过大家知道历史上有很多事实证明美国有进行侵略和支持侵略者的实际经验。抛开这些不讲，美国参议员明白地说，美国现在还反对对侵略下定义，美国认为这对于美国统治集团是不相宜的。
    在这类事件中，英美代表团有著名的英国政治家罗伯脱·西塞尔等人做老师，西塞尔是一九一六至一九一八年劳合·乔治内阁的“封锁”大臣，也是国际联盟的组织者之一。西塞尔勋爵曾任临时联合委员会的特别委员会的主席，该委员会的职务是就确定侵略案件的问题提供意见。这个特别委员会的报告说，按照现代战争的情况来说，甚至在理论上也不可能规定侵略的定义。这个委员会反对对侵略下任何定义的办法，它指出各国政府对侵略的判断只可凭印象决定。
    西塞尔勋爵虽然坚持着说甚至在理论上也不可能确定侵略定义，但在实际行动中却从事侵略。他于一九一七年十二月与法国缔结了一个秘密公约，这个公约是关于在俄国划分势力范围和支持反革命分子亚列希耶夫的反动匪帮的；亚列希耶夫当时正对年轻的苏维埃共和国作战。
    在艾登先生一九三三年裁军会议上的演说中，他对确定侵略定义的建议所采取的反对态度是根据在国际联盟行政院作了多年英国代表的一位很受人尊敬的政治家的意见。这位很受人尊敬的政治家说，侵略的定义可能只成为无辜者的陷阱，犯罪者的避难所。
    这位很受人尊敬的政治家就是大家都知道的奥斯汀·张伯伦，他的政策的反动侵略性质也是大家都知道的。
    在西塞尔和奥斯汀·张伯伦这种政治人物的领导之下，不可能希望英国外交界支持拟订便于打击侵略的各种措施，这是完全可以理解的，正好像我们很难盼望英国现在的代表来支持这样的措施一样。
    因此，属于北大西洋侵略集团的各国代表们决心反对任何侵略定义，并竭力想为他们的立场找一个理论上的根据，这并不是偶然的事情。
    这一次美国代表没有对侵略定义问题，详细发表它的意见。这个问题目前正在第六委员会讨论。而且他说，美国仍然不知道在这次大会继续进行确定侵略定义的工作有什么道理。从他这次所说的一点点的话看来，很明显的是：美国认为无法支持一个不包含一切可能的侵略案件的定义。从他的发言来判断，他建议这个委员会的任务应限于联合国宪章第三十九条所规定的范围，这条说：“安全理事会应断定任何和平之威胁、和平之破坏，或侵略行为之是否存在”。美国代表团认为不能对这三个概念下一个精确的、完善的定义，因而认为没有理由企图给侵略的概念下一个比“和平之威胁”或“和平之破坏”的概念更为完善的定义。
    这里不妨赘述一下，一九四五年美国所持的观点与今日不同，那时的观点就是今日苏联所支持的观点。从美国代表团的公开声明看来，使美国在这件事情上改变立场的原因，是由于这样一个事实：目前国际关系的情况已使美国相信：给侵略下一个定义，不仅是不适宜的事，甚至是危险的事。美国代表团宣布说：美国政府所采取的新立场与它在一九四五年的立场截然相反，这完全是由于国际局势所致。
    因此，整个问题归结到目前的国际事态。大家知道，目前国际事态的中心是美国的侵略政策，这个政策的目的就是准备发动一次新的世界战争，和夺取统治世界的霸权。
    四、在批评的幌子下悍然歪曲事实
    尽管美国已公然承认了这些事实，但是美国的官员们还假惺惺地表示他们愿意继续准备给侵略下一定义的工作，虽然他们怀疑这工作会不会成功。而且他们企图掩饰他们对这个工作的不赞成态度，他们用各种理由来掩盖，可是这些理由的矫揉造作的性质却又逃不了众人的眼睛。这些理由之一是：侵略这个概念的本身性质就不可能下一个精确的定义，若硬要给它下一个定义，便要使用一些名词，而这些名词的本身又需要下个定义，这就是他们所谓的不可克服的困难。
    美国、英国和其他国家的代表团对于这个问题的论据的完全不可靠，可以从一九三三年二月六日苏联代表团所建议的侵略定义以及苏联根据这个定义的原则与拉脱维亚、意大利、波兰、罗马尼亚、土耳其、伊朗、阿富汗、捷克斯洛伐克和立陶宛在一九三三年七月三日至五日所缔结的一系列的关于侵略定义的公约得到证明，也可以从美洲各国间的互助条约（一九四七年九月二日在里约热内卢签订的）等一类的公约得到证明。
    单是这一点就足以驳倒英国代表的说法，就是说由于侵略的本质所以不能对侵略一词下一个十分精确的定义，并且如果要对侵略下一个定义那就必须使用术语，而术语却又需要定义，所以据说这是一个不可克服的困难。
    批评苏联代表团所提出来的关于侵略定义草案的人说，假如实行这个定义所依据的原则——即一国如首先攻击他国应作侵略者论，那末英国在一九一四年向德国宣战，它就成为侵略者了，因为德国只是侵略了比利时而不是英国。另外一些人指出，同样，法国和英国在一九三九年通知国际联盟说它们已和德国处在交战状态时，情形也和上例一样。这种说法的荒谬根本无须加以证明，因为这完全是存心歪曲苏联草案的意义和文字的结果。这里，别的不用多说，我只要提一提出席纽伦堡审判的英国首席检察官肖克劳斯于一九四五年十二月四日在审讯德国纳粹党魁的国际军事法庭上对这一类荒谬的说法的答复。他当时说：
    在第二次世界大战刚爆发的时候，英国和法国通知国际联盟说：从一九三九年九月三日起，它们就和德国处于交战状态中，它们当时宣布德国侵略波兰，因而不仅破坏了它对波兰的义务，而且还破坏了它对其他在巴黎公约上签字的国家所承担的义务。
    对公约一个签字国破坏了义务，也就是等于向其他的签字国发动了袭击，而且它们完全有权利这样看待这件事。
    纽伦堡审判的英国首席检察官这个结论的公正是无可非议的，这就证实了这类对苏联定义的批评是完全站不住脚的。这些批评者费尽一切力气来争辩苏联提出的定义的价值。他们说，人类天生有一种自然的对侵略的概念，这是一种人类天然的概念。某些批评者就根据这种论调说，拿两个小孩打架做例子，就可以十分正确的说明这一种概念，然而却不能令人推断出一种可以在法律上有明确定义的尺度。这种把交战双方和两个小孩打架比拟的办法，简直是百分之百的胡说。这种比拟的荒谬可笑，连这些批评者自己也看得十分清楚，因此他们目前又搬出另一种新的比拟法，也就是刑事法庭中的法官的那种比拟法。
    希腊代表在联合国第六届大会上指出：例如一个法官应根据他所审理的案件的种种情况来决定是否有攻击的行动，尽管他曾读过的许多刑事法典谈到攻击。这个推论并不比第一个更好一些，因为大家知道，虽然一个法官应根据案件的种种情况来宣布判决——这是不能有另外的办法的——但是同时他在确定罪行和裁定这种罪行的刑罚时应该根据法律并在法律范围以内行事。
    因此，如果说一个法官用直觉根据某种关于侵害的自然概念来判断案件，那将是十分可笑的事。
    为了挑剔我们的定义的毛病，批评家指出：侵略的定义至少必须具备两个要素，即客观的要素和主观的要素。他们承认，客观的要素，或是确定侵略的客观标准，是一个国家先于对方的同样行动对对方进行的直接的、间接的或是隐蔽的侵害行动。“先于”这词的意思就是指第一个进行这种行动的一方。这恰恰是苏联提出的定义草案中所说的话。
    自然，在任何定义中都不可能把直接、间接的或隐蔽的侵害的一切例子列举出来，正如任何刑事法中都不可能把——我用批评我们的人的推论——一切可能发生的暗杀、袭击、诽谤及其他等等的例子都列举出来一样。这种情形只要从下列的例子就可以看出。刑事法中规定有诽谤罪，但是它并没有明确地说明根据这个刑事法，什么样的话在这个刑事法下才被认为是诽谤。关于这一点，可能有很多不同的话，这种话说起来的音调也有许多种。一句话或是一句引用语都可以被指为诽谤。例如，一个在遇到人时用雷娜德狐狸遇见驴子时的话说：“好啊，我的博学朋友，你也可能到过什么地方吗！”像这样的话可以诽谤一个人。
    这的确是一种诽谤，但是你在刑事法上是找不出关于这个特殊问题的适当规定的。而且这一点是十分容易理解的。
    为了对付罪行，只须指出最普遍的、最典型的、最重要的例子就够了。这正是我们的定义所规定的。因此，一个满足上述条件的定义，纵使不能详尽地列举一切可能的侵略例子，是绝对不可以被拒绝的。
    我们应该记住：任何演绎法的科学定义比起根据经验而不根据演绎下的定义来始终是比较不明确，价值也要少一些。
    至于衡量侵略的主观方面的标准，所谓主观的侵略意图，则又是由许多事实、由进攻方面在进攻以前的一切活动的性质来决定的。
    在这方面，最好回顾一下刚好与侵略相反的一项原则，即自卫权利。有人提到自卫者首先放枪的权利，这是所有刑法都承认的权利。有人说：“在受到侵略的威胁时，一个国家为了要打击另一国家的侵略意图，有权首先进攻以进行自卫，即令另一国家并未采取实际的侵略行动。”有人说：可能有这样一种冲突，在这种冲突中并没有侵略者，两个国家都没有侵略意图或自卫行为。据说：如果两个国家都愿意以战争来解决它们的争执，那么它们都不是采取合法自卫行动的被侵略者，因此，在这种情况下，也没有侵略者。
    这里我们有三种情况值得讨论。当然，在第一种情况下，采取自卫行动的国家是无可争辩地正确的；在第二种情况下，冲突双方都没有侵略目的，这也是无可争辩的。在这种情况下，并没有侵略的表示。并没有一国对另一国宣战，也没有一国武装部队侵入另一国的领土等。这样，就没有侵略的问题。所有这些情况当然应该由受权对这些事件作出决定的国际机构来加以确定。
    至于第三种情况，两国都要用战争来解决它们的争执，有人在这种情况下得出的结论是：在这种情况下并没有侵略者，我们不能同意这个结论。
    关于同样的问题，美国国务卿史汀生在一九三二年说：签订白里安—凯洛格公约的国家都反对国际间的战争。这就是说战争已在全世界被宣布为非法。它不再有合法的地位；它不再是决定人们的行为与权利的关键。它已经成为非法的东西。所以，当两国交战时，双方都是有罪的，都是这个公约所确定的法律的破坏者。其他国家不再需要对它们有所区别，也不再需要按照决斗规则对待它们；相反的其他国家认为它们都是违法者。
    美国司法部长在一九四一年三月二十七日演说时也考虑到许多国家都承担了不把战争当做政策的工具的国际义务。他当时强调说：反对战争的条约与阿根廷非战条约剥夺了签字国家把战争当作国家政策的工具或侵略工具的权利，并宣布那些破坏条约条款而发动的战争为非法。因此，这些条约就破坏了中立主义的历史的与法律的基础，这些中立主义一向就是在侵略战争中绝对不偏向任何一方。
    由此可见，一个发动战争因而违反了它的义务的国家，没有权利要其他国家同样对待它，假如条约中所规定的义务不要求以其他办法解决问题的话。这样一个国家由于它干了不法行为，享受不到这种权利。
    这就是对苏联草拟的“侵略”定义的所谓批评。这并不是批评，而不过是以批评为幌子一种悍然的对事实的歪曲而已。
    五、美国战争贩子反对确定侵略定义
    那些猖狂反对像苏联所起草的那样明确的侵略定义的国家，甚至要提出一个古怪的理论，建议：既然说没有不可置辩的确定侵略定义的标准，那就必须承认各国政府对这个问题的意见必须只是以从许多不同的事实中得到的印象为根据了。他们把这种理论叫做“侵略的自然概念”，这种“侵略的自然概念”，他们说，能够而且必须在不同的时间、在不同的条件下有不同的解释。换句话说，所有那些能够当作对侵略和侵略者下定义的根据的客观标准最后要依每一个有关政府的个别意见或武断意志来决定。
    这样一种理论对于那些执行侵略政策的政府来说，是非常便利的。自然，这样一种理论也使那些国家可以得到一个有很大“伸缩性”的侵略定义，这样地有“伸缩性”，以致于破坏了对侵略下定义的可能性，并且取消了国际上的侵略定义的全部重要性，或是使它完全失掉作用。这种定义本来是可以当作一种限制因素和反对真正侵略者的措施的基础的。
    在这个问题上，也是美国统治集团在操纵一切。
    美国外交政策已从合作改变到冷战——另一次世界大战的前奏。美国所关心的不是抑制侵略者和打破战争贩子的侵略计划，而是扫除发动另一次世界大战的道路上的障碍。美国反动集团和支持他们的某些国家的反动集团正在准备这样的世界大战，以便完成美国亿万富翁和他们在其他国家的同谋者的疯狂计划。
    美国和英国的代表们对于侵略定义所采取的态度只能说是企图阻止大会通过一个能够在制止这种最危险的国际罪行方面起真正重大作用的侵略定义。美英两国采取这种态度不是偶然的。这种态度和现代资本主义的基本经济法则是有直接联带关系的。
    斯大林在他最近的伟大的著作“苏联社会主义经济问题”中证明现代资本主义基本经济法则的主要特点和要求是“用剥削本国大多数居民并使他们破产和贫困的办法，用奴役和不断掠夺其他国家人民、特别是落后国家人民的办法，以及用旨在保证最高利润的战争和国民经济军事化的办法，来保证最大限度的资本主义利润。”这个经济法则就迫使垄断资本主义组织新的战争来榨取最高利润并取得世界经济霸权及世界政治霸权。
    垄断资本主义的具体特征也规定了它的国际政策的本质和具体特征。这种政策引起了大国瓜分世界经济和政治地盘的斗争。其具体特征表现在竭力使用威吓手段、攫取新的领土、殖民地和市场的企图上。现代国际局势的发展证明，各种各样正在建立或已经发生作用的资本主义联盟，都是在瓜分世界经济地盘的基础上组织的。各国之间的关系也是同样建立在瓜分世界地盘和争夺殖民地及市场的基础上的。而这又反过来加深了资本主义国家之间的矛盾；约·维·斯大林证明，在第一次世界大战与第二次世界大战之间，资本主义国家间争夺市场的斗争以及它们想把自己的竞争者淹死的愿望，在实践上要比资本主义阵营和社会主义阵营间的矛盾更为剧烈。
    马克思列宁主义教导我们，资本主义世界里的联盟，不管采取什么形式，不管是一个帝国主义集团反对另一个帝国主义集团，例如协约国家反对三角同盟国家，还是一切帝国主义国家的总同盟，在实际上都不过是两次战争之间的“暂息时间”。
    马克思列宁主义教导我们说：“和平时期的联盟为战争准备基础，而且也自战争中产生；两者是互为因果的。这种联盟造成互相更替的和平与非和平斗争的方式，这种斗争产生于同一个基础，即帝国主义的联系以及世界经济和世界政治的关系。”——
    （列宁）。
    当然在这里不能深入地谈论这个问题。然而所说过的一切，已足以充分说明大西洋侵略集团国家的代表所采取的立场的根源。虽然这些国家因为它们的经济、财政与政治状况的特点而意见不一，但是他们却一致反对侵略的定义。联合国通过这样一个侵略定义，对实现它们的侵略计划就会是一个很大的阻碍，会剥夺它们手中的战争凶器。联合国大会通过这样一个定义就会给予所有真诚的和平支持者另一件反对发动新的世界大战的武器。
    自然，没有一个人会被这些侈谈和平与自命希望消除另一次世界大战威胁的大事宣扬的演说所欺骗；这类演说正从帝国主义阵营中，像洪流一样地倾泻出来。
    全部战争史，尤其是近一世纪来的战争史，很清楚地说明资本主义国家间战争的真正原因与目的。同时，战争史揭露出某些国家是喜欢发动战争的，而且常常不喜欢解决那些引起这些国家统治集团之间的争执的问题。
    关于这一点，像法国有名的国际法专家福歇尔教授这样的资产阶级科学家也看得清清楚楚，他著的“国际法”一书谈到十九世纪中历次战争的原因时，引证了好几个不同战争的真正原因作为例子。例如：“一八六四年向丹麦发动战争的藉口，是奥古斯丁堡公爵的继承权问题和德意志同盟所提出的权利要求。而作战的真正原因是普鲁士希望扩张它的领土。
    “一八七○年普法战争的藉口，是侮辱了法国的代表，这个侮辱是在诽谤性的电报中加于他的，而这个电报，正如俾斯麦自己承认的，是他与陆军大臣丰纶和毛奇元帅共同在柏林草拟的，它的目的是要激动德国人和法国人的情绪。而作战的真正原因是普鲁士希望通过并肩作战的方式把德意志统一在普鲁士的霸权之下。”
    大家知道，帝国主义战争时代是以西班牙和美国的战争开始的，这个战争的目的，显然是为了抢夺古巴和菲律宾。
    著名的科学家维尔特在他一九一三年著的一本书名叫“世界近代史”中，专门辟了一章“论古巴战争”，他在这一章中论到美国，他写道：
    “美国佬们一开始的时候曾大事宣传各国人民一律平等，并宣传他们追求一个充满了和平安逸的幸福的理想国家。经过长期的过程以后，他们获得了一个结论，即：人民的不平等是不可变更的，最后他们采取了用武力实行征服的政策。他们最初对一切事物标榜自由，贸易要自由，彼此之间的关系要自由，对其他信仰、种族和国家要表示容纳。他们最后竟实行了最凶狠的保护关税政策、对天主教徒采取了愈来愈厉害的敌视态度，对其他民族和外国进行坚决的侵略。”
    法国科学家德列奥在一九○○年他的著作“政治问题”中写道：“因此，对古巴的战争是一场经济战争，因为这次战争的目的在于夺取这个岛国的蔗糖市场；同样地，美国并吞夏威夷群岛和菲律宾是为了要夺取这些热带国家所生产的咖啡和蔗糖而引起的。”
    “因此，夺取市场和搜刮热带的产品--这就是形成被称为帝国主义的殖民扩张政策的基本原因。而且所有这些殖民地也都是优良的战略基地，这些基地的重要性，我们以后再谈……，为了也保证他们的亚洲市场……他们需要支援的基地。”
    顺便说一句，有许多科学的历史著作都论述美国对古巴的干涉。
    美国与西班牙进行争夺古巴的战争时，标榜所谓维护“自由”和古巴的“解放”等等，然而，从上面可以看出，战争爆发的真正原因却完全是另一回事--完全是由于美国殖民主义者的物质和自私的利益。
    当美国并吞菲律宾的时候，它曾保证给菲律宾以自由。但是谁不知道，美国征服者无耻地欺骗了菲律宾领袖阿基纳多，同时出于同样的征服的欲望，他们用向来的办法镇压菲律宾人民。
    意大利于一九三五年进攻阿比西尼亚，并且占领了阿比西尼亚。德国和意大利于一九三六年武装干涉西班牙，德国侵入西班牙北部及西属摩洛哥，意大利侵入西班牙南部及巴利阿利群岛。日本在占领中国东北部以后，于一九三七年侵占华北和华中，占领了北京、天津和上海。希特勒德国于一九三八年占领了奥地利，一九三八年秋季占领了捷克斯洛伐克的苏台德省。日本于一九三八年占领了广州，一九三九年初占领了海南岛。
    在所有这些侵略行为面前，国际联盟表现得没有力量，不能采取相应的措施来对付侵略者，所有这些侵略行为说明国际联盟里的统治力量没有履行它们防止侵略的职责，正像联合国的领导核心北大西洋集团国家一样，这些国家现在也没有履行它们的责任，因为它们拒绝结束侵略朝鲜的战争，拒绝停止折磨这个英勇的小国家。
    侵略问题和必然随之而产生的确定侵略定义的问题，是今天的既迫切又重要的问题，而侵略的定义是安全理事会在进行反对可能的侵略的活动时必须当作指导原则的。资本主义国家之间的矛盾产生了战争的威胁，这些矛盾，特别是主要资本主义国家--美国和英国--之间的矛盾非但没有消除，而且更加剧烈了，采取了公开争夺市场，争夺原料，特别是战略原料--橡胶、有色金属、稀有金属、石油等的形式。
    不仅是美国和英国之间的矛盾更加尖锐了，就是美国和日本、美国和意大利、美国和西德之间的矛盾也更加尖锐了。资本主义阵营里的这些矛盾不久还要更加剧烈。美帝国主义者已经对朝鲜人民进行了两年以上的战争，资本主义国家国民经济的越来越军事化以及殖民地和附属国家的民族解放运动的高涨，这些都更加暴露出帝国主义的殖民体系的瓦解，以及随之而来的新的矛盾的加剧。
    部长会议副主席马林科夫在他最近的报告里说，目前的国际局势说明美帝国主义者正在渗入像英国、法国、比利时等这些殖民国家的殖民地和势力范围；他们正在为自己掠夺地盘，鼓动反对他们的英、法“盟友”的阴谋，把许多殖民地和附属国家
    （埃及、伊朗、叙利亚、摩洛哥、突尼斯等）的领土当作军事基地，并且年复一年地加紧准备未来的世界大战。
    在这种情况下，像裁减军备和武装部队、禁止原子武器、停止使用惨无人道的细菌武器这样的措施，以及像明确规定侵略的定义，以约束所有的国家这样的措施，根本就不合他们的心意了。所有这些措施，在北大西洋集团的首领看来，都是相当危险的。
    他们想尽办法避免这种“危险”，用各种理由和编造出来的法则来掩饰他们的立场。
    六、苏联提出的侵略定义--争取和平制止另一次世界大战的威胁的重要工具
    尽管给侵略一词下一个有力的定义以便使联合国有关机构能利用它来进行抵抗侵略的重要任务的努力遭到了反对，第六届大会仍然非常正确地认识到：虽然侵略的罪行可以按照每个事件的具体情况来下论断，但是为了保障国际法及安全并发扬国际刑法起见，根据侵略的组成部分来确定它的定义不仅是可能而且是有益的。大会提起大家注意这个事实，就是，确定了侵略的定义对于将来拟订给负责决定谁是侵略者的国际机构的指示的时候，是必然有用的。
    大会基于这些考虑，在第六届会议上决定把确定侵略一词的定义问题，列入第七届大会的议程。
    苏联提出的侵略定义，大体上就是安全委员会于一九三三年根据苏联在一九三三年二月六日的建议所拟订的定义。
    苏联提出的侵略定义还在国际法的理论中得到充分的承认。这可以在资产阶级科学界闻名的法学家、如贝拉、卡洛扬尼、柯森蒂尼等人的著作中找到证明。这些法学家在研究国家对国际罪行的责任时都是从苏联在一九三三年提出的侵略定义出发的。卡洛扬尼在一九三四年写道：“我们可以说，伦敦公约（即侵略国定义公约--编者）为新的法律秩序、为任何持久和平的必要条件奠定了基础。”这个法律的重大历史意义是无可怀疑的，因为，正像我们已经在前面指出的，它也是关于这个问题的许多国际条约的基础。我不得不引证一下对这个法律的意义有所说明的安全委员会的报告，虽然这个报告已经是二十年以前的事。报告指出：表现在这个文件中的法律是裁军会议所策划的整个安全制度的基础，它消除了关于诉诸武力的国家是否算进行攻击的问题的怀疑与争论。报告指出：这样，各国就可以事先知道，为了不被认作是进攻方面或侵略者，它们不能够做些什么事。即使在国际机构没有进行任何干预时，这样一个定义也是具有价值的。它会使得关于使用武力的禁令具有更大的权威性，并让舆论与其他国家可以具有更大信心来判断这个禁令是否得到遵守。
    报告指出：当有人要求国际机构确定某一次冲突中的真正攻击方面是谁时，如果在观念上有一种明确的定义可供这些机构应用，那么它们在指出谁是攻击者时就容易多了，并且它们不会给人以印象，说应用的规则已被破坏，也不会由于某些政治原因而替攻击方面掩饰及辩解。
    委员会的同一报告强调指出用列举构成侵略的因素的办法来起草一个定义的重要性。
    如果我们研究一下历史教训，那么，会证明联合国第一届大会的立场同样是正确的，因为历史证明：侵略者始终企图把自己说成是防御方面，或用下述理由为他的进攻辩解，即：对方已侵犯了他的权利和利益或者已产生了一种所谓威胁到他的安全的形势。他这样做的目的是要用这些或类似的诡计掩饰他的侵略。侵略战争的罪恶组织者在发动战争时，一向说他们完全是为了自卫。大家普遍知道的这种性质的事例不胜枚举，我们只要提几个就够了。
    东京国际法庭的判决书说：日本军国主义首脑之一荒木贞夫在号召准备侵略战争时说，目的只是民族自卫，在动乱中建立秩序和在远东创造一个理想的世界与乐园。
    在荒木贞夫看来，日本的国防不仅限于防卫日本本土，还要防卫他们所说的皇道（征服其他国家并把它们卷入所谓“共荣圈”的道路）。
    同时，首相田中将军在一九二七年向日本天皇提出的臭名远扬的田中奏摺--日本外交政策问题的秘密报告--也证明了这一点。大家都知道，这个奏摺直截了当地要求对苏联和美国发动战争，这个要求是在所谓基于日本的切身利益，这种战争不可避免的掩饰下提出的。
    纽伦堡法庭的判决证明了：希特勒匪帮也曾提出基于德国国防以及取得所谓生存空间的需要的说法，为他们武装侵占他国领土的行动辩解。
    像这样的例子是举不胜举的。但是所举出的几个实例，已经足以明确表明，苏联代表团在提案中再度向大会提出的侵略定义里面所包括的建议的正确性。
    像苏联代表团提案中的序言所说的那样，必须使侵略的定义成为将负责确定那一方犯了进攻罪行的国际机构的行动准则。
    这样了解侵略定义的作用是符合联合国第六届大会的上述决议的，这个决议确定侵略的定义必须成为一个指示，指导负责指出谁是侵略者的国际机构的行动。
    在给侵略下定义的时候，一个非常重要的因素是要承认这个原则，就是：任何国家不论它以什么为藉口，不论它出于什么动机，只要它首先发动战争，也就是说首先采取定义中列举的任何行动，就必须被宣布为侵略者，而且要它对因此产生的一切后果负责。
    由此可见，这样解释侵略者的标准，是再明显不过而且是唯一可能的标准，这个标准是国际法中已承认很久的定义的基础。
    谁先采取了定义第一节中所列举的行动这个事实，是确定那些行动是侵略行动的一个重要先决条件。
    这样解决问题是完全符合宪章所规定的联合国的目标和任务的。
    那么，假如一个国家首先对另一个国家或是另外一些国家采取行动的话，什么行动才能说是侵略行为呢？
    这些行动是：对另一个国家宣战；甚至不宣战就以武装部队侵入其它国家的领土；以陆军、海军或空军攻击另一个国家的领土，或是故意攻击另外一个国家的海军或空军；没有得到另一个国家的政府的许可，或是破坏这种许可的条件，特别是停留的期限，或是地区的范围，以陆军、海军或空军在该国境内登陆，或是开进该国国境；以海军封锁另一个国家的海岸或港口；最后，对于在它的领土上组织起来然后侵入另一个国家领土的武装匪徒给以支持，或是不顾被侵国家的要求，拒不在它自己的领土上采取能力所及的所有措施，取消这些匪徒所得的援助或保护。
    苏联建议的侵略的定义草案第二节与第三节也是很重要的，我认为这不需要特别的解释。
    最后，苏联代表团得出下列结论：
    一、确定侵略的定义是完全可能的。这已由历史上的经验所证明--苏联曾经提出一个侵略定义。而苏联在一九三三年七月三日到七月五日与一些国家缔结的十一个国际公约和一些其他国际协定，都包括了这个定义。
    二、侵略的定义是有用的。包括上述定义并成为苏联与其他国家友好关系的基础的公约，已为它们之间的和平合作开辟了道路。
    三、侵略的定义是必要的。因为它能够作为一个授权的国际机构在研究国际武装冲突问题时所遵循的准则。它能够作为安全理事会在应用联合国宪章第七章第三十九条与其他各条时的指导原则。
    四、侵略的定义在危险的当前国际局势中是必要的、有用的，因为它是一个重要工具，有了这个工具，反对侵略与侵略者、对目的在于侵占与奴役外国与外国人民的非正义的掠夺战争的斗争就便于进行了。
    苏联代表团坚决支持它所提出的要求确定侵略定义的建议，并要求所有的其他国家代表团都支持这个建议，因为这个建议是符合所有爱好和平国家的切身利益，并符合维护与加强和平及消除另一次世界大战威胁的利益的。
