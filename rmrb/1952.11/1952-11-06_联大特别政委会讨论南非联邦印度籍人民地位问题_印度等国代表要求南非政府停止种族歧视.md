Xinhua News Agency, New York: The United Nations General Assembly's Special Political Committee began discussing the issue of the treatment of people of Indian descent in the Union of South Africa on the 3rd, according to TASS reports.

    The representative of the Union of South Africa, Mr. Jooste, spoke first, insisting that this issue was a matter of "domestic affairs" for the South African government, and therefore the United Nations General Assembly had no right to handle it.

    The representative of India, Mrs. Pandit, then spoke. She reminded all members of the committee that the United Nations General Assembly had been compelled to discuss this issue for the seventh time. In tracing the history of previous discussions, the Indian representative pointed out that the Union of South Africa had fundamentally failed to implement previous resolutions of the United Nations General Assembly on this issue, therefore, "due to increasingly intensified racial tensions, the world is facing an imminent danger." Mrs. Pandit put forward a joint proposal from India, Afghanistan, Burma, Egypt, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Lebanon, Liberia, Pakistan, the Philippines, Saudi Arabia, Syria, and Yemen. The proposal called for the establishment of a "United Nations Conciliation Commission" to arrange and assist in the resumption of negotiations between the governments of India, Pakistan, and South Africa on this issue. The proposal also requested that the Union of South Africa government cease implementing the provisions of the "Apartheid Law" pending the outcome of the aforementioned negotiations. The proposal also stipulated that the commission must submit a report to the Eighth Session of the United Nations General Assembly.

    The representative of Pakistan, Mr. Bokhari, supported India's position and analyzed the provisions of the "Apartheid Law" one by one. The representative of Iraq, Mr. Jamali, also supported India. In replying to the representative of South Africa, he said that according to Articles 10 and 13 of the United Nations Charter, the United Nations General Assembly has the right to consider this issue because it involves the principle of promoting international cooperation.

    The committee adjourned at this point and reconvened on the 4th.

    联大特别政委会讨论南非联邦印度籍人民地位问题
    印度等国代表要求南非政府停止种族歧视
    【新华社五日讯】据塔斯社纽约讯：联合国大会特别政治委员会三日开始讨论南非联邦印度籍人民所受到的待遇问题。
    南非联邦代表约斯特首先发言，他硬说这个问题是南非政府的“内政”问题，因此联合国大会无权处理。
    印度代表潘迪特夫人接着发言。她提醒委员会全体代表注意：联合国大会不得不讨论这个问题，这次已是第七次了。印度代表在追溯以前的讨论情况时指出：南非联邦根本没有执行以前联合国大会关于这个问题的决议，因此，“由于种族紧张局势日益加甚，世界正面临着迫在眼前的危险”。潘迪特夫人提出一项印度、阿富汗、缅甸、埃及、印尼、伊朗、伊拉克、黎巴嫩、利比里亚、巴基斯坦、菲律宾、沙特阿拉伯、叙利亚与也门的联合提案。提案中要求成立一个“联合国斡旋委员会”来布置与协助恢复印度政府、巴基斯坦政府与南非政府间关于这个问题的谈判。提案中并要求南非联邦政府停止实施“种族隔离法”的条款，以等待上述谈判的结果。提案中并规定委员会必须向联合国第八届大会提出报告。
    巴基斯坦代表鲍卡利支持印度的主张，并逐一分析了“种族隔离法”的条款。伊拉克代表贾马利也支持印度，他在答复南非代表时说：根据联合国宪章第十条与第十三条，联合国大会有权考虑这个问题，因为它牵涉到促进国际合作的原则。
    委员会至此休会，到四日再开。
