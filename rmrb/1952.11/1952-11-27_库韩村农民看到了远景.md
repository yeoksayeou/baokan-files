    Farmers in Ku Hancun See a Bright Future
    Speech by Zhang Xuexiu, Farmer Representative from Qingfeng County Returning from the Soviet Union

    When I returned to our Ku Hancun from the Soviet Union, the villagers all liked the record player and camera given by the Soviet friends; but what they liked most was hearing me introduce the situation of Soviet farmers. Because from the introduction of the Soviet farmers' situation, everyone saw the bright future of socialist collective farms. People's eyes lit up, and their minds broadened. Although Ku Hancun is still that same village, the people's enthusiasm is very different from before I returned from the Soviet Union.

    In our village, after the land reform, everyone was very enthusiastic about production, but there were also a small number of people with ideological problems. For example, the middle peasant Ku Xiyan has an old couple, a young couple, and two small grandchildren in his family; thirty mu of land and an ox are enough to eat well every year. He participated in a mutual aid group of five households, but he was not very enthusiastic, feeling that the new society does not promote landlords, and Communist Party members do not promote exploitation, so it is enough to live like this, and it could not be better. Recently, after hearing me introduce the collective farms in the Soviet Union, he saw a new path. One day he said to me: "Before you came back, I had this idea: Our revolution was not in vain, and life is good. It's like a tobacco plant growing four leaves, and you pinch the tip to keep it from rising or falling, just working hard on these four leaves; now after hearing what you said, I know that the Soviet farmers' lives are so good; it seems that our cornmeal steamed buns can be exchanged for white steamed buns in the future!" He discussed with me turning the mutual aid group into an agricultural production cooperative. I asked the other group members, and Ku Minghan, Ku Mingheng, and Chen Yunjiao all said: "Who doesn't look forward to reaching a socialist society sooner! Xiyan even agrees! We agree even more!" I promised to help them study it, thinking that in order to implement socialism in the future, we must cooperate and help each other to achieve high yields now, so that we can move forward step by step and live a more fulfilling life.

    When I went to the Soviet Union, some people in the village guessed that I was going to the Soviet Union to "move methods," saying that once I came back, the village would "join the big pot." Now these people know that they were wrong. Those who did not dare to apply fertilizer to the fields have let go; those who were unwilling to help each other have also started helping each other. They want to organize to improve production, improve step by step, and eventually move to socialism and live a happy life like Soviet farmers.

    Now, all over the village, in every household, everyone is talking about the issue of mutual aid and cooperation leading to collectivization. There are no more individual households in the village, and the number of long-term mutual aid groups and agricultural production cooperatives has increased, because six individual households have joined mutual aid groups, and seven temporary mutual aid groups have been changed to long-term ones. Da Hancun (natural village) is more than half a kilometer away from my village. Farmers Ku Jun and Ku Kui from Da Hancun heard that our mutual aid group had been changed into an agricultural production cooperative and came to ask to join. Because they are far away, and they were afraid it would be inconvenient to work, I promised to help them organize later.

    When villagers heard me say that the Soviet farmers' farming methods were better than ours, and that their unit area yield was constantly increasing, they no longer said that sandy land could not increase production. This year's wheat yield averaged five dou per mu. The older generation has never had such a good harvest, but everyone believes that it can be improved next year. When I returned to the village, the higher-ups were advocating narrow-row close planting of wheat. The masses were originally skeptical, but when they heard me say that Soviet wheat was densely planted, they all believed it. As a result, 85 percent of the land was planted with three-row wheat. In the past, one mu used two and a half to three sheng of seeds, but this year it has been increased to three sheng. On 1,385 mu of wheat land, an average of 6,000 jin of grass manure and 60 jin of soybean cake were applied per mu. The story of Soviet Socialist Labor Hero Altyonov's high corn yield has greatly inspired the masses. Ku Xiyan said: "They harvested more than 2,970 jin of corn per mu, and they want to harvest more than 3,000 jin. It seems that the land is really powerful, and production will never reach the top!"

    The collectivist spirit of Soviet farmers has also had a great impact on the masses. In the past, mutual aid groups wanted to accumulate some public property, but this was very difficult; because people only wanted to distribute more, feeling that only what is accumulated in their own hands is their own. Now they all know that collective interests are connected to personal interests. When our mutual aid group was transformed into an agricultural production cooperative, it was stipulated that a portion of the total income should be drawn each year as a production fund, which would be used to buy livestock, farm tools, fertilizer, seeds, and the like; 5 percent would be drawn as a welfare fund, which would be used to help families with unexpected difficulties; and 1 percent would be drawn as a bonus, with production summarized three times a year, and whoever works well and contributes a lot would be rewarded with this money. After hearing that Soviet land is owned by the state and that members are "paid according to their work," everyone also realized that they should earn their living by their own labor, and not just rely on land to earn a living, and that labor remuneration should be appropriately increased when the agricultural production cooperative distributes dividends. Our cooperative also learned from the Soviet collective farms the method of piece-rate wages. Next year, the entire cooperative will plant 30 mu of cotton. In addition to plowing and planting, the work in the cotton field will be contracted by seven women. It is planned to harvest 120 jin of cotton per mu. If 140 jin are harvested, they will get 5 jin of the extra 20 jin; if 200 jin are harvested, they will get 20 jin of the extra 80 jin, with a reward of one-quarter.

    The women in our village were extremely excited when they heard about the labor situation of women in Soviet collective farms. But then came a question: How can we learn technology and operate machines without education? Wang Suzhen, the director of the women's association, had attended a few folk schools in the past, but because of family matters, she was intermittent, and she still does not recognize many characters. Thinking about the future, she became anxious. She ran to me and said: "You have seen socialist society, what should I do if I can't read? Now I want to go to elementary school and start learning from scratch, but if I don't cook at home, the old people will be unhappy!" I went to discuss with her father-in-law, Minghan, and her husband, Chaojing, saying that for the sake of the future, we must overcome difficulties now and let the young people learn more skills. Chaojing certainly did not object; Minghan also fully agreed, saying: "If that is the case, she should go to school, and the family will not restrict her at all. It does not matter if she does not cook, I will talk to his mother." Now there are 20 or 30 women in the village between the ages of 18 and 30 who have made up their minds to go to school; after hearing about it, the county specially sent a female teacher. Now there are two elementary school teachers in our village. In the future, we also plan to promote the rapid literacy method in the village. I think learning culture this winter will definitely reach a climax.

    The cadres saw that the future was bright, and they were not afraid of losing work. When they talked about going to meetings in the district or county, they scrambled to go; whoever was asked to receive training did not refuse. Ku Mingcai said: "To serve the masses, you have to sacrifice a little bit. If we don't train in our work, we won't be able to do it at that time. In the future, we must overcome difficulties and not just feel wronged." Wang Suzhen went to the county twice in October, the first time to the People's Congress of All Circles, and the second time to the Labor Model Conference. Her father-in-law, Ku Minghan, did not mind that she was delaying her work at all, and even said: "Go, let Chaojing carry your quilt for you!"

    Wang Zhilin's wife already has six children, and is now pregnant again. If two had not died before, she would soon have nine. Wang Zhilin heard that the Soviet Union rewards having many children, and felt that it best suited his taste. He said to me very happily: "Lao Zhang, if China had reached socialism ten years earlier, two children would not have died, and my wife could have become a 'Mother Hero'." He knows that socialism is not waiting, and recently joined the agricultural production cooperative.

    A few days ago, Ku Ge carried a load to Yan Village and Su'erzhuang to sell oil. As soon as he arrived at the street, he talked about the collective farms in the Soviet Union, and he did not even bother to sell the oil. The people buying oil shouted at him with cans for a long time, but he could not hear them. Someone asked him loudly: "Ku Ge! Are you still selling your oil?" He said: "It doesn't matter if I sell it or not, I have to explain it thoroughly." Not only Ku Ge, but all the people in the village have become propagandists, going to the market, visiting relatives, and talking to people they meet.

    库韩村农民看到了远景
    清丰县访苏农民代表  张学修讲
    我从苏联回到俺们库韩村，苏联友人送的留声机、照像机，村里人们都很喜欢；可是最喜欢的还是听我介绍苏联农民的情况。因为从苏联农民情况的介绍里，每个人都望见了社会主义集体农庄的远景。人们眼光一亮，心胸也就开阔了。别看库韩村还是那片房子，可是人们的心劲儿，和我从苏联回来以前却大不一样了。
    我们村里，土地改革以后大家都生产得很起劲，但是也有一小部分人思想上有问题。比如中农库喜彦，家里有老俩口、小俩口，还有两个小孙孙；三十亩地一头牛，年年打的粮食满够吃。他参加了一个由五家组成的互助组，可是干的不算很起劲，觉得新社会不兴地主，共产党员又不兴剥削人，过到这样就行了，再好也不过如此。最近他听我介绍苏联的集体农庄后，才又看见了新路。有一天他对我说：“你回来以前，我有这么个思想：咱们革命没白革，日子闹得不错了，就像一棵烟长够了四个叶，把尖一揪齐住顶，不上升，不下降，光向这四个叶上使劲就行了；现在让你这么一说，才知道苏联农民生活那么好；看起来咱这玉米面馍今后还能换成白馍馍哩！”他和我商量把互助组变成农业生产合作社，我问了问别的组员，库明汉、库明衡、陈云姣都表示：“谁不盼早到社会主义社会！喜彦还同意呢！俺们更同意！”我答应帮助他们研究研究，要想将来实行社会主义，现在就必须合作互助搞丰产，才能一步步的前进，过更美满的生活。
    我到苏联去的时候，村里有些人猜我是到苏联“搬法”去了，说我一回来，村里就要“入大伙”。现在这些人知道自己想错了。不敢在地里上肥料的也放开劲了；不愿意互助的也互助起来了。他们是想组织起来提高生产，一步一步的提高，将来走到社会主义，过起像苏联农民那样的幸福生活。
    现在，全村街头巷尾、家家户户，到处谈论的都是互助合作走到集体化这个问题。全村单干户没有了，长期互助组和农业生产合作社增加了，因为六个单干户都已经分别参加了互助组，有七个临时互助组已经改成长期的了。大韩村（自然村）离我那村有一里多地，大韩村农民库俊和库魁听说我们的互助组改成了农业生产合作社，找来要求参加。因为离的远，怕做活不方便，我答应以后帮助他们去组织。
    村里人们听我谈了苏联农民种地方法比咱们强，人家的单位面积产量不断提高以后，再不说沙地不能增产了。今年的小麦平均每亩打五斗，老辈儿没有这么好收成，可是人人相信明年还能提高。我回村的时候，上级正号召小麦窄行密植，群众本来有怀疑，一听我说苏联的小麦是密植的，才都相信了。结果有百分之八十五耩的是三垄麦。往年一亩用种籽二升二、三合，今年都增加到三升。一千三百八十五亩麦子，每亩普遍上到六千斤草粪，六十斤豆饼。苏联社会主义劳动英雄阿尔节诺夫玉米丰产的事迹，给群众启发很大。库喜彦说：“人家一亩玉米收了二千九百七十多斤，还要收三千多斤，看起来地劲真大，生产永远也到不了顶！”
    苏联农民的集体主义精神，对群众影响也很大。过去互助组想攒些公共财产，可这就很难办；因为人们光愿意多分点，觉得只有攒在自己手里才是自家的。现在都知道集体利益和个人利益是相连的。我们的互助组转为农业生产合作社时，已经规定每年从总收入中抽出一部分算做生产基金，用它来买牲口、农具、肥料、种籽之类的东西；抽出百分之五算做福利基金，谁家有个意外的困难，用它来接济；抽出百分之一算做奖金，一年三次总结生产，谁劳动好、贡献大，就用这笔款买奖品奖励谁。听了苏联土地国有，庄员“按劳取酬”以后，大家也认识到应该凭自己的劳动挣饭吃，不能光靠土地挣饭吃，农业生产合作社分红时，劳动报酬要酌量提高。俺们社里还学习了苏联集体农庄按件计工的办法，明年全社要种三十亩棉花，除耕耩以外，棉花地里的活，由七个妇女包下来。计划每亩收一百二十斤棉花，如果收了一百四十斤，多的二十斤里就有她们五斤；如果收了二百斤，多的八十斤里就有她们二十斤，按四分之一提奖。
    俺村妇女们听说苏联集体农庄妇女们的劳动情形，都兴奋极了。可是随着就来了个问题：没文化那能学技术开机器呢？妇女会主任王素珍，过去上过几天民校，因为家里的事儿牵扯着，三天打鱼，两天晒网，到现在没认几个字，想到往后，就着起
    急来。她跑来对我说：“你看到了社会主义社会，我不识字可怎么办？现在我想上小学从头学起，可是家里的饭不做，老人们又不高兴！”我找她公公明汉和她丈夫朝经去商量，说为了往后好，现在就得克服困难，让年青人多学点本事。朝经当然不反对；明汉也满口赞成，他说：“既是那样，他尽管上学去，家里一点也不限制，饭不做不要紧，我和他娘说去。”现在村里十八岁以上、三十岁以下的妇女有二三十个，都已拿定主意要入学；县里听说后，特地给派来一位女教员。现在俺村小学教员有两个人了。今后还准备在村里推行速成识字法，我看今年冬天学文化一定能成高潮。
    干部们看到前程远大，也不怕误工了，一说到区到县开会，争着要去；说叫谁受训，谁也不推辞。库明才说：“给群众办事，自己就得牺牲点，咱不在工作里锻炼，到那时可就干不成了。以后得克服困难，不能光觉得冤枉。”王素珍十月里一连两次到县里开会，头一次是各界人民代表会，第二次是劳动模范会，她公公库明汉一点也不嫌她耽误功夫，还说：“去吧，让朝经给你扛着被子！”
    王芝琳的老婆已经有六个孩子，现在又怀了孕，要不是以前死了两个，很快就是九个了。王芝琳听说苏联奖励多生孩子，觉得最合自己的口味，他很高兴的对我说：“老张，要是早十年前咱中国就到社会主义，两个孩子也死不了，我老婆就可当‘母亲英雄’啦。”他知道社会主义不是等来的，最近也参加了农业生产合作社。
    前些天，库阁挑着担子到阎村和苏儿庄卖油，一到街头就讲起了苏联的集体农庄，连油也顾不得卖了，买油的提着罐子喊他半天，他也听不见，有人大声问他：“库阁！你的油还卖不卖？”他说：“卖不卖不要紧，说就得说透彻。”不光是库阁，全村的人都成了宣传员，赶集串亲戚，见人就讲。
