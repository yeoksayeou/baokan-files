    The "Echoes" of the Red Flag Song and Dance Ensemble
    Zou Difan
    The Red Flag Song and Dance Ensemble is singing in chorus,
    The defenders of human happiness are singing in chorus,
    On this side of the mountain they sing, on the other side it echoes,
    On this side of the sea they sing, on the other side it echoes.
    When the Ukrainian steppes were ravaged by Hitler,
    When brotherly troops were waging guerrilla warfare in the Carpathian Mountains,
    The Red Flag Song and Dance Ensemble sang,
    The anti-aggression songs echoed in the hearts of the soldiers.
    In the era of striving for lasting peace,
    In the great period of communist construction,
    The Red Flag Song and Dance Ensemble is singing,
    The songs of peace echo in the hearts of millions.
    Oh! Moscow and Beijing are singing,
    The heartfelt voice of the friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people is echoing,
    The thoughts of Lenin and Stalin are being sung,
    The voice of striving for people's democracy is echoing throughout the world.

    红旗歌舞团的“回声”
    邹荻帆
    红旗歌舞团在合唱，
    人类幸福的保卫者在合唱，
    山这边在唱，山那边在响，
    海这边在唱，海那边在响。
    当乌克兰草原被希特勒蹂躏的时候，
    当兄弟的部队在喀尔巴阡山进行游击战的时候，
    红旗歌舞团在歌唱，
    反侵略的歌声在战士们胸头上回响。
    在争取持久和平的时代，
    在伟大的共产主义建设时期，
    红旗歌舞团在歌唱，
    和平的歌声在千万人的胸头回响。
    哦！莫斯科和北京在歌唱，
    中苏两国人民友谊的心声在回响，
    列宁、斯大林的思想在歌唱，
    争取人民民主的声音在全世界回响。
