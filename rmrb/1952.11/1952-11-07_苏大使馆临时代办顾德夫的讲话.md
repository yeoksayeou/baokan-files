    Chairman, dear friends and comrades!
    Tomorrow, the people of all nationalities of the Soviet Union, as well as the people of great China and the people's democratic countries, and the workers of the whole world, will celebrate the thirty-fifth anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution; the October Revolution opened a new era in human history.
    The great October Socialist Revolution established brotherly relations between the people of the Soviet Union and China. The enemies of the people of the Soviet Union and China have tried every possible way to hinder the establishment of friendly relations between the two great peoples, because they are afraid of this friendship.
    The founding of the People's Republic of China paved the way for the development of brotherly relations between the people of the Soviet Union and China.
    We are very pleased to see how the people of our two countries are increasingly consolidating and developing friendship and cooperation in all aspects of life.
    In this year alone, hundreds of representatives of science, culture, art, workers, women, and youth organizations, as well as worker and peasant representatives, from the People's Republic of China have visited the Soviet Union, toured Soviet factories, collective farms, universities, and theaters, and learned about the life, work, and achievements of the Soviet people in communist construction. The representatives of the great Chinese people were able to see with their own eyes how the Soviet people expressed their love for the People's Republic of China, for the Chinese people, and for their great leader, Comrade Mao Zedong. On the other hand, hundreds of Soviet scientists, cultural workers, workers, women, and representatives of other groups have visited the People's Republic of China this year. Now we are witnessing firsthand how the Chinese people are welcoming with warm and sincere emotions the Soviet cultural and artistic workers and the Soviet Army Red Flag Song and Dance Ensemble who have come to China to participate in the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month" activities. Soviet representatives can also see with their own eyes the boundless love of the Chinese people for the Soviet Union and the great Comrade Stalin.
    The friendship between the people of the Soviet Union and China, and the alliance between the world's most powerful countries, the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, is the most reliable guarantee of peace in the Far East and the world.
    The recent successful talks between the governments of the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China once again demonstrated the development of Sino-Soviet friendship and the consolidation of the Sino-Soviet alliance.
    Everyone knows that in these talks, important political and economic issues between the Soviet Union and China were discussed in order to safeguard and consolidate peace and security throughout the world.
    Comrades! When talking about Sino-Soviet relations, it should be stated that the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association has made great contributions to the cause of developing cooperation between the people of our two countries. We wish the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association victory in the lofty task of consolidating and developing mutual understanding and cooperation between the people of the Soviet Union and China!
    Long live the unbreakable friendship between the people of the Soviet Union and China!
    Long live Chairman Mao Zedong, the great leader of the Chinese people!
    Long live the great Stalin, the leader of progressive humanity throughout the world!

    苏大使馆临时代办顾德夫的讲话主席，亲爱的朋友和同志们！
    明天，苏联各族人民以及伟大的中国和各人民民主国家的人民、全世界的劳动者，将要庆祝伟大的十月社会主义革命三十五周年；十月革命在人类历史上开辟了新的时代。
    伟大的十月社会主义革命，在苏中两国人民之间建立了兄弟般的关系。苏中人民的敌人千方百计地企图阻碍我们两国伟大人民之间的友好关系的建立，因为他们害怕这种友谊。
    中华人民共和国的成立，为发展苏中人民之间的兄弟般的关系铺平了道路。
    我们很愉快地看到我们两国人民在生活各方面上，如何日益巩固，并且发展了友好与合作。
    仅仅在今年一年之内，就有中华人民共和国的数百名科学、文化、艺术、职工、妇女和青年团体的代表和工农代表访问了苏联，参观了苏联工厂、集体农庄、大学、剧院，并且在各地认识了苏联人民在共产主义建设中的生活、工作和成就。伟大的中国人民代表能够亲眼看到苏联人民如何对于中华人民共和国、对于中国人民和他们伟大的领袖毛泽东同志，表示热爱。在另一方面，成百苏联科学家、文化工作者、职工、妇女，和其他团体代表，在这一年里，曾经参观了中华人民共和国。现在我们亲眼看到中国人民用如何热烈、衷诚的情绪，欢迎到中国来参加“中苏友好月”的活动的苏联文化艺术工作者和苏军红旗歌舞团。苏联代表也能亲眼看到中国人民对于苏联和伟大的斯大林同志表示无限的热爱。
    苏中人民之间的友谊和世界最强大的国家，就是苏联和中华人民共和国之间的同盟，是远东和全世界和平最可靠的保障。
    苏联政府和中华人民共和国政府代表团之间新近成功的商谈，再一次表现苏中友好的发展和苏中两国同盟的巩固。
    人人都知道，在这次商谈里，为了维护和巩固和平和全世界的安全，讨论了苏中两国之间重要的政治和经济问题。
    同志们！谈到苏中关系的时候，应当说明，中苏友好协会对于发展我们两国人民合作的事业，作了很大的贡献。我们祝中苏友好协会在巩固和发展苏中两国人民之间互相了解和合作的崇高的任务胜利！
    苏中两国之间牢不可破的友谊万岁！
    中国人民伟大领袖毛泽东主席万岁！
    全世界进步人类的领袖伟大的斯大林万岁！
