    The Industry Department of the Pingyuan Provincial People's Government Corrects the Error of Neglecting Surveying and Drilling
    Editor: The People's Daily published on August 23rd the criticism from Comrade Wang Xue regarding the neglect of surveying and drilling work by the Hebi Coal Mine, which is under the jurisdiction of our department. This criticism is correct. The facts and future remedial measures are reported as follows:
    We began preparing for the Hebi Coal Mine in 1949. During the preparation work, surveying, drilling, and design were conducted, and approved by the Central Fuel Industry Department and other agencies. Formal well sinking commenced on June 11th of this year. However, due to the inadequate thoroughness of the surveying and design before well sinking, significant losses have been incurred after construction. The Hebi Coalfield covers a large area and has good coal quality, but it has a wide and thick layer of Quaternary accumulated loess on top. Without high-level geologists, it is difficult to survey thoroughly. We did not anticipate this beforehand. During construction, we only used an old drilling rig (with a maximum efficiency of 400 meters) and blindly estimated where there was a problem and drilled there. As a result, problems were proven to have occurred at both ends of the 2,000-meter strike. At the same time, the preparatory work was also poor, so that when water was encountered during construction, there were no water pumps, and we had to use leather bags to bail water. Insufficient understanding of the geological conditions, lack of thorough surveying and drilling, and proceeding with construction based only on partial understanding, all demonstrate our blindness in capital construction work. The reason for this error is that we were afraid of doing more drilling, which would cost more money and damage the drilling rig. At the same time, we had a mentality of being eager for quick success. Geological surveying and drilling are the most important basis for coal mine construction, and we did not have a sufficient understanding of this point.
    We have now consulted with the Central Fuel Industry Department and other agencies, and submitted a request to the North China Administrative Council to re-investigate the geological conditions of the coalfield, re-do the planning and design, and intensify the study of advanced Soviet experience in order to correct the mistakes made.

### 平原省人民政府工业厅纠正忽视勘察和钻探的错误

    平原省人民政府工业厅纠正忽视勘察和钻探的错误
    编辑同志：人民日报八月二十三日刊载了王雪同志对我厅所属鹤壁煤矿忽视勘察钻探工作的批评。这个批评是正确的。现将事实经过和今后补救办法报告如下：
    一九四九年我们就开始筹办鹤壁煤矿。在筹备工作中进行了勘察钻探与设计，并经过中央燃料工业部等机关的批准，今年六月十一日正式开工凿井。但是，由于凿井前的勘察设计不够周密，以致施工后造成很大损失。鹤壁煤田区域较大，煤质较好，但是，上有四叠纪堆积的很宽很厚的黄土层，没有水平较高的地质学家，很难勘察得透。这是我们事前没有估计到的，施工时我们只用一部旧式钻机（最大效能为四百公尺），根据盲目的估计，那里有问题即在那里下钻。结果顺走向二千公尺的两端，经钻探证明都发生了问题。同时准备工作作的也差，以致开工遇水没有水泵，不得不用牛皮包打水。对地质情况了解的不够，没有周密的勘察和钻探，只根据片面的了解，就进行施工，这说明我们在基本建设工作中的盲目性。造成这种错误的原因是由于我们怕多做钻探，花钱又多，伤害钻机，同时又有急于求成的思想。地质勘察和钻探，是煤矿建设工作的最重要的根据，对这一点我们是认识不足的。
    现在我们已与中央燃料工业部等机关商洽，呈请华北行政委员会同意，重新调查煤田的地质情况，重做计划设计，加紧学习苏联先进经验，以纠正所犯错误。    平原省人民政府工业厅
