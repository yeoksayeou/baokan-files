Following the criticism by the Central People's Government Patriotic Health Campaign Visiting Group of the Taiyuan City Department Store Food Section and the Taiyuan Railway Bureau Railway Hospital for their erroneous behavior in not paying enough attention to the Patriotic Health Campaign, the criticized units expressed sincere acceptance of the criticism and immediately published articles of self-criticism in the *Shanxi Daily*, outlining specific measures to improve sanitation work. Zhou Huamin, Director of the Commercial Bureau of the Shanxi Provincial People's Government, and others stated in their self-criticism that the errors made by the Taiyuan City Department Store Food Section in the Patriotic Health Campaign were "mainly due to insufficient understanding of the Patriotic Health Campaign by the leadership, lack of in-depth guidance and inspection, and manifestation of serious bureaucratic work style." They stated that, in addition to sincerely accepting the criticisms made by the Central People's Government Patriotic Health Campaign Visiting Group, they also requested appropriate administrative penalties from the leadership. In addition, after an emergency meeting, they decided to take emergency measures to improve sanitation work in the trade system.

Liang Ziru, Manager of the Shanxi Provincial Department Store, said in his self-criticism: "We have made a public self-criticism in the newspaper for the poor sanitation work. But why hasn't there been any change to date? The fundamental reason is that we have not truly attached importance to the Patriotic Health Campaign, and we lack a clear understanding of the great political significance of the Patriotic Health work. We have not regarded the Patriotic Health Campaign as a powerful action to smash the bacteriological warfare of American imperialism; we have not realized that the Patriotic Health Campaign is closely related to the health of millions of people and the country's production and construction; and we have not realized that unsanitary environments are breeding grounds for bacteria. Therefore, inspections and discussions are perfunctory, just talk, and we have not seriously and responsibly inspected and corrected ourselves ideologically. This shows the extent to which my bureaucratic work style has become serious. Secondly, our capitalist business ideas are still very strong. We believe that sanitation work requires spending money, unilaterally emphasizing frugality and financial systems, and ignoring the health of millions of people and the leading role that state-owned enterprises should play in the campaign. This directly affects the physical health of the people and the prestige of state-owned enterprises."

Lang Daonan, Director of the Taiyuan Branch of the Tianjin Railway Bureau, said in his self-criticism: "Since the launch of the Patriotic Health Campaign, the Patriotic Health work of the Railway Hospital has basically not been mobilized. The leadership of the hospital has a very vague understanding of the Patriotic Health Campaign as a political task, and has not carried out propaganda and education for employees. Therefore, their sanitation work is still at the level before the Patriotic Health Campaign. The inspection of the Railway Hospital by the Central People's Government Patriotic Health Campaign Visiting Group sounded an alarm for us. After the inspection by the visiting group, the hospital immediately convened meetings within the Party, the Communist Youth League, and among all staff members. And it has mobilized everyone to rectify the sanitation work. Although this is only the beginning, we are determined to further improve the sanitation work of the hospital on this basis."

    太原市有关单位领导人员的检讨
    自中央人民政府爱国卫生运动参观团对山西省太原市百货公司食品部和太原铁路分局铁路医院不重视爱国卫生运动的错误行为提出批评之后，被批评的单位都表示诚恳接受批评，并立即在山西日报上发表了思想检查的文章，定出了改进卫生工作的具体办法。山西省人民政府商业厅厅长周化民等在检讨中认为，太原市百货公司食品部在爱国卫生运动中所以发生错误，“主要是由于领导方面对爱国卫生运动认识不足，没有深入地进行指导和检查，表现了严重的官僚主义作风。”他们表示，除诚恳接受中央人民政府爱国卫生运动参观团提出的批评意见外，并要求领导方面给予适当的行政处分。此外，他们经过紧急会议讨论，决定采取紧急措施，以改善贸易系统的卫生工作。
    山西省百货公司经理梁子儒检讨说：“我们因卫生工作搞得不好，曾在报纸上作过公开检讨。但为什么至今没有什么改变呢？根本的原因还是我们没有真正重视爱国卫生运动，对爱国卫生工作的重大政治意义缺乏明确认识。没有把爱国卫生运动看成是粉碎美帝国主义细菌战的有力行动；没有认识爱国卫生运动是和千百万人民的健康、国家的生产建设有着密切关系的；更没有认识到不讲卫生的环境是细菌的温床。因此，检查、讨论都是敷衍塞责，看看说说了事，根本没从思想上认真负责地检查纠正。这说明我的官僚主义作风已严重到什么程度。其次是我们的资本主义的经营思想还很浓厚。认为要作好卫生工作必须花钱，片面地强调节约和财务制度，忽视了千百万人民的健康和国营企业在运动中应起的带头作用。这就直接影响了人民群众的身体健康，影响了国营企业的威信。”
    天津铁路局太原分局局长郎焘南检讨说：“从爱国卫生运动开展以来，铁路医院的爱国卫生工作基本上没有动起来。院的领导方面对爱国卫生运动是一个政治任务认识得很模糊，对员工没有进行宣传教育，因之，他们的卫生工作还停留在爱国卫生运动前的水平上。这次中央人民政府爱国卫生运动参观团对铁路医院的检查，给我们敲响了警钟。在参观团检查后，医院立即在党内、青年团内及全体工作人员中，分别召开了会议。并已全体动员起来，整顿了卫生工作。这虽仅是开始，但我们有决心在此基础上进一步改进医院的卫生工作。”
