    Xinhua News Agency, Paris, November 23rd: According to TASS, the French Communist Party published a statement in "l'Humanité" to commemorate the sixth anniversary of the French colonial army launching war against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on November 22nd, exposing the criminal nature of this war.
    The statement pointed out: It has become increasingly clear that the reason this war against the Vietnamese people continues is entirely to preserve the privileges of colonialists and merchants and to secure positions for the American army near the border of People's China.
    The French Communist Party once again declares: The only policy that conforms to the interests of France is to make peace and recognize the policy of the Vietnamese people, united around the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and President Ho Chi Minh, to strive for peace and freedom.
    Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, November 22nd: TASS, Berlin, November 19th: The German News Agency reported: The crew of the Danish transport ship "Lotte," which is currently being repaired in Kiel, West Germany, refused to transport weapons to Vietnam. When the crew learned the destination of the ship, they all, including the captain, requested to be dismissed.

    法国共产党发表声明
    揭露侵越战争的罪恶性质
    丹麦船员拒绝运送军火到越南
    【新华社二十四日讯】据塔斯社巴黎二十三日讯：为了纪念六年前法国殖民军于十一月二十二日向越南民主共和国发动战争，法国共产党在“人道报”上发表声明，揭发这个战争的罪恶性质。
    声明中指出：情况已变得越来越明显，这个反对越南人民的战争之所以继续进行，完全为的是保存殖民者和商人的特权，并替美国军队在接近人民中国边疆的地方取得阵地。
    法国共产党再次宣告：唯一符合法国利益的政策，是讲和、并承认团结在越南民主共和国及胡志明主席周围的越南人民争取和平与自由的政策。
    【新华社二十二日讯】塔斯社柏林十九日讯：德意志通讯社报道：目前正在西德基尔修理的丹麦运输船“洛特”号的船员拒绝运武器到越南去。当船员们知道了这只船行驶的目的地后，他们全体，包括船长在内，要求将他们解雇。
