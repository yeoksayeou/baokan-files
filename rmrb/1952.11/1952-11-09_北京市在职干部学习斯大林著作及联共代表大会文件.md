    北京市在职干部学习斯大林著作及联共代表大会文件
    中共北京市市委宣传部规定全市在职干部从十一月七日起到十二月六日一个月中，学习苏联共产党第十九次代表大会的文件。学习的主要目的是：一、使干部了解世界形势，关心世界的革命运动，以扩大干部眼界；二、使干部了解苏联的社会和国家的发展状况，懂得苏联的发展对世界的意义，从而更关心苏联，更好地学习苏联在各方面的先进经验；三、使干部由学习联共对各项工作的经验总结，进行对于自己的工作方法和领导方法的检讨，并提高对于学习马克思列宁主义的必要性的认识。学习的文件以斯大林同志在代表会议上的演说和马林科夫同志的报告为主，高级班并同时学习“苏联社会主义经济问题”，及联共代表大会的其它文件。学习方法，高级、中级班以自学为主，并联系自己工作和思想进行有准备的讨论；高级班的干部和党的报告员对初级班作通俗的讲解或传达。现北京市大部分工厂学校已拟定出学习计划。
