    Eradicating the Terrible Phenomenon of Cadres Infringing Upon Human Rights

    The handling of three cases of cadres infringing upon human rights by the Zhejiang Provincial People's Government and the Discipline Inspection Committee of the Zhejiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China illustrates that the actions of certain cadres in our political organs in infringing upon the people's democratic rights and violating laws and regulations have reached an extremely serious point. One of the important reasons why these cadres dare to act so recklessly is that their superiors have a serious bureaucratic work style, disregard the interests of the masses, distrust the masses, and listen to the false reports of cadres without principle.

    What is even more serious is the case of Liang Zhen, the former County Magistrate of Yuqian County, and Wu Xianxiang, the Deputy County Magistrate and President of the Court. When they were severely criticized by the appellant, Pan Xiangqiu, for blindly believing the false reports of lower-level cadres, they became enraged and illegally detained Pan for nine days. After Pan Xiangqiu returned to the county after appealing to higher-level organs, they, with the direct connivance of the Lin'an Branch of the Provincial People's Court, lawlessly detained Pan for seventy-seven days! If this extremely bad work style is allowed to develop, our people's regime will deteriorate, and the people's democratic rights will lose their guarantee!

    However, their superiors turned a blind eye to such a serious problem: After the truth of the Pan Xiangqiu case came to light, the Lin'an Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China still handed over the follow-up matters to Liang Zhen, Wu Xianxiang, and others who had been insisting on their mistakes. This extremely irresponsible bureaucratic work style, which occurred after the "Three-Anti" Movement, is completely intolerable.

    The solemn handling of the relevant personnel by the Party and government leading organs of Zhejiang Province is completely correct and necessary. Party and government organs in other regions should also take this as a lesson, continue to carry out the struggle against bureaucracy, and resolutely eliminate bureaucrats and bad elements in the revolutionary ranks so that our people's governments at all levels become organs that are closely linked to the people and serve the people.

    肃清干部侵犯人权的恶劣现象
    浙江省人民政府和中共浙江省委纪律检查委员会处理的干部侵犯人权的三个案件说明：我们政权机关的某些干部侵犯人民民主权利和违法乱纪的行为，达到了极端严重的地步。而这些干部所以敢于如此胡作非为，其重要原因之一，是他们的上级有严重的官僚主义作风，漠视群众利益，不相信群众，无原则地听信干部的假报告。
    更严重的是前于潜县县长梁震和副县长兼法院院长吴献祥。他们因盲目相信下级干部的假报告而受到申诉人潘香球的严正批评时，竟羞恼成怒，蛮横地将潘非法扣押九天。在潘香球到上级机关申诉回县后，他们又在省人民法院临安分院的直接纵容下，无法无天地把潘扣押了七十七天！这种极端恶劣的作风如果任其发展下去，我们人民的政权就要变质，人民的民主权利就要失去保障！
    但是，他们的上级对这样严重的问题竟视若无睹：中共临安地委在潘香球案真相大白以后，仍把善后事宜交给一直在坚持错误的梁震、吴献祥等去处理。这种极端不负责任的官僚主义作风发生在“三反”运动以后，是完全不能容忍的。
    浙江省党、政领导机关对有关人员的严正处理，是完全正确的、必需的。其他地区的党和政府机关，也同样应以此引为教训，继续开展反官僚主义的斗争，坚决肃清革命阵营中的官僚主义者和坏分子，使我们的各级人民政府成为紧密联系人民群众、为人民办事的机关。
