To the Editor: I am a duty electrical technician at the Dalian Electrical Section of the China Changchun Railway. My ability to transform from an ordinary worker into a technician is inseparable from the help of Soviet experts such as Comrade Simonov.

During the Japanese puppet regime of Manchuria, due to my limited education, I had no opportunity to learn technology. I remember the Japanese devils often saying, "To learn carrier wave technology, you must know trigonometry and geometry, and you must have attended a specialized school." After liberation, I often worried about my low level of education, preventing me from learning carrier wave technology. When Soviet expert Comrade Simonov learned of my situation, he talked to me and said, "Don't be afraid of having a low level of education. I was just like you at first, knowing nothing, but after studying, I learned it." Later, he taught me basic electrical theory and technology, as well as simple Russian. Knowing my low level of education, he used many easy-to-understand examples to explain the technology to me until I understood it. Once, when I was on duty, I found that the oscillator had malfunctioned and could not be used. I told Comrade Simonov, and he asked me to disassemble the oscillator's mechanism for repair. I disassembled the mechanism but didn't know what to do. Comrade Simonov personally repaired it and carefully told me how to repair it. In this way, I finally learned how to repair oscillator faults.

With the help of Comrade Simonov, I am now fully capable of mastering relatively complex technologies in electrical communications, such as long-distance testing and carrier wave testing. I am extremely grateful to Comrade Simonov for his education.

    在苏联专家的帮助下我从一个普通工人成了技师
    编辑同志：我是中长铁路大连电务段值班电气技师。我能够从一个普通工人成为技师，是和苏联专家西蒙诺夫等同志的帮助分不开的。
    在伪满时期，我由于文化程度的限制，没有学习技术的机会。我记得日本鬼子常说：“学习载波技术，必须会三角、几何，必须读过专科学校。”解放后，我经常为自己文化程度低，不能学习载波技术而发愁。苏联专家西蒙诺夫同志知道了我的情况，他就找我谈话，他说：“你不要怕文化程度低，我起初也跟你一样，什么也不会，但我经过学习，我就会了。”后来他就教我初步的电气理论和技术以及简单的俄语。他知道我的文化水平低，在教技术时，他举出很多通俗的例子给我讲解，一直到教会我为止。有一次，在我值班的时候，我发见振荡器发生故障，不能使用，我告诉西蒙诺夫同志，他叫我把振荡器的机械卸下来修理，我卸了机械，不知道怎么好，西蒙诺夫同志亲自修理，并仔细地告诉我应该怎么修理。这样，我终于学会了修理振荡器故障。
    在西蒙诺夫同志的帮助下，我现在已经完全能掌握电气通信中比较复杂的技术，如市外试验、载波试验等。我万分感激西蒙诺夫同志对我的教育。
