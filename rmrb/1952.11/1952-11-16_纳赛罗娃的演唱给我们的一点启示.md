    Some Enlightenment from Nasarova's Singing
    Zhao Feng

    Chinese audiences appreciate the singing of Halima Nasarova, the Soviet People's Artist and Stalin Prize laureate, with great interest. This is not only because her singing, which is full of national characteristics and the high-pitched and bright voice unique to Orientals, makes us feel close; her singing also gives our music workers some important enlightenment on the development and improvement of national singing methods.
    It should be recognized that Nasarova's great achievements today are by no means accidental. This is because: Thirty-five years of great socialist cultural construction have enabled the musical culture of all ethnic groups in the Soviet Union to achieve unprecedented development. Before the revolution, Russia had only two conservatories. Now, Almaty, Tashkent, Kazan, and other important cities in the republics have conservatories. There are already twenty conservatories in the Soviet Union. Before the revolution, Russia had only seven opera houses. Now, opera houses have been established in the capitals of the Kazakh, Tajik, Kyrgyz, and Buryat-Mongol union republics and autonomous republics. There are more than thirty opera houses in the Soviet Union. Because of this, Nasarova, a singer of a nation, can receive a complete musical education in the National Research Institute of the Moscow Conservatory, and become a People's Artist from an orphan.
    Nasarova's achievements embody an important aesthetic principle of Soviet music, that is, the national form. The bourgeois modern music school is trying to destroy all the characteristics of national music, trying to use quarter tones, atonal structures, and convulsive, hysterical rhythms to replace vivid national musical languages ​​and expressive melodies; trying to use that kind of crazy, erotic, "fat man's music" to eliminate the waltzes and "Morris dances" of Austrians and Englishmen. But in socialist Soviet Union, the musical cultures of all ethnic groups with vivid national characteristics are developing vigorously because these musical treasures have been owned by the people.
    Of course, the music of all ethnic groups in the Soviet Union must also be able to express the people's thoughts and feelings, and use musical images and singing art to encourage the people of all ethnic groups in the socialist era to strive for a bright and beautiful future of communism.
    Expressed in Nasarova's singing, the simple "Uzbek Girl's Song of Peace" which sings of human unity and friendship, the "Kazakh Waltz" which is full of the joy of labor and the joy of youth, and the performance of the three songs such as "Victory" which is intoxicated in the happiness of liberation and toasts for freedom, concretely and profoundly express the high ideological content of Soviet singing art. This ideological content is the organic combination of real life and poetic description, that is, the high harmony of truth and poetry.
    It should be pointed out that it is not accidental that Nasarova chose these three songs to sing. This is because these songs are rooted in folk songs, but they are not clumsy plagiarism and mechanical restoration. New life and new themes require new expression methods and new musical languages, but this new style of advancement is not like those crazy "innovators" who sever tradition and break away from the people, but to strengthen the influence of music among the masses, cultivate and develop new and good appreciation tastes, and more appropriately express new life and new things. Beautiful, moving melodies, clear, organic harmonies, and natural, full rhythms.
    The hearty laughter in the "Kazakh Waltz", the optimistic confidence in the "Song of Peace", and the free joy in the "Victory" are all vividly and profoundly conveyed to the audience.
    The first characteristic of excellent singing art is that all vocal techniques serve the expression of language. Nasarova's singing clearly illustrates this point. Those who advocate that "bel canto is everything" are essentially trying to reduce the content of music and the meaning of poetic language. The ancient Chinese opposed "sacrificing meaning for the sake of words", and this maxim also applies to vocal singing.
    The second characteristic of excellent singing art is that all singing techniques serve the expression of emotions. Nasarova's singing is a good example in this regard. Anyone who has heard Nasarova's singing has been conquered by her emotions and momentum. Everything she sings has the greatest persuasive power because she herself is so convinced.
    Another important significance of Nasarova's performance in our capital is the enlightenment it gives us in developing and improving national style singing methods.
    China's vocal music circle once debated the issue of so-called foreign voices and local voices. Although there have been relatively consistent opinions in some aspects, there is no clear and feasible plan on how to improve and develop national singing methods to establish systematic training methods and a school of singing art. Therefore, the path that Nasarova has taken should be our best reference.
    We know that Nasarova once went to the Moscow Conservatory to study as a national singer. During this period, she mainly studied the general knowledge of music science, including theoretical courses such as music history and composer research, as well as technical theory courses such as harmony and counterpoint. In the words of the famous composer Zakharov: "This enriched her musical knowledge, cultivated her aesthetic point of view, and more importantly, established a correct musical appreciation ability." This means that the important thing is to arm oneself with all the musical scientific knowledge, not to eagerly use another completely different school of singing's vocalization method, performance techniques, etc. to replace her original method. But after she has obtained the necessary musical knowledge, she consciously absorbs what she thinks is appropriate, that is, things that do not contradict her original method. Therefore, when Nasarova finished her studies at the Conservatory and returned to her hometown to sing, at first, people wondered and asked: "Why did she have to go to Moscow to study? She still sings the same as before!" This shows a very important point, that is, after Nasarova went through college-style studies, she did not get rid of her original singing method, but only improved her original singing method, and the national style in her singing has not changed in the slightest.
    This approach gives us great enlightenment. China's music circle should further discuss this issue, formulate concrete plans to train our own national school of singers, and improve and develop our musical singing art.

    纳赛罗娃的演唱给我们的一点启示
    赵渢
    中国听众以极大的兴趣来欣赏苏联人民艺术家、斯大林奖金获得者哈利马·纳赛罗娃的歌唱。这不仅是因为她的富于民族色彩的、东方人特有的高亢嘹亮的歌唱使我们感到亲切；她的演唱中更使我们音乐工作者体会到发展和提高民族歌唱方法的一些重要启示。
    应该认识，纳赛罗娃获得今日的伟大成就绝不是偶然的。这是因为：三十五年的伟大的社会主义文化建设使得苏联各民族的音乐文化获得了空前的发展。革命前的俄罗斯只有两所音乐院，而现在，阿拉木图、塔什干、喀山和其他共和国的重要城市都有了音乐院，全苏联已有音乐院二十所。革命前的俄罗斯只有七所歌剧院，而现在，在卡查赫、塔吉克、吉尔吉斯、布里亚蒙古等加盟共和国和自治共和国的首都，都设立了歌剧院，全苏联已有歌剧院三十所以上。因为如此，纳赛罗娃，一个民族的歌者，才可以在莫斯科音乐院民族研究室中受到完善的音乐教育，由一个孤儿变成了一个人民艺术家。
    纳赛罗娃的成就体现了苏维埃音乐的一个重要美学原则，那就是民族的形式。资产阶级的现代乐派正在企图毁灭一切民族音乐的特点，企图用四分音、无调性的结构和抽筋般的、歇斯底里的节奏去代替生动的民族音乐语言和富有表现力的曲调；企图用那种疯狂的、色情的、“肥人的音乐”消灭奥地利、英格兰人的圆舞和“摩利斯舞”。但在社会主义的苏联，具有生动的民族特色的各民族的音乐文化，由于这些音乐宝藏已经为人民所有，而正在蓬勃地发展着。
    当然，苏维埃各民族的音乐还要能够表现出人民的思想和情感，用音乐的形象、演唱的艺术来鼓舞社会主义时代各民族人民为光辉的共产主义的美好未来而奋斗。
    表现在纳赛罗娃的演唱上，歌颂人类团结友爱的纯朴的“乌兹别克女郎的和平之歌”，和充满着劳动的愉快、青春的欢乐的“哈萨克圆舞曲”，以及陶醉在解放的幸福中为自由而干杯的“胜利”等三首歌曲的表演，具体而深刻地表现了苏维埃演唱艺术的高度思想内容。这种思想内容是现实生活和诗的描写的有机结合，也就是真实和诗意的高度调和。
    应该指出，纳赛罗娃选择这三首歌曲来演唱也不是偶然的。这是因为这些歌曲根源于民间歌曲，但不是拙劣的抄袭和机械的复原。新的生活和新的主题要求新的表现方法和新的音乐语言，但这种新的风格的行进不是像那些疯狂的“革新者”那样割绝传统和脱离人民，而是为了加强音乐在群众中的影响，培养并发展新的和好的鉴赏趣味，更恰当地表现新的生活和新的事物。美丽的、动听的曲调，和明晰的、有机的和声以及自然的、饱满的节奏。
    “哈萨克圆舞曲”中的那种爽朗的笑声，“和平之歌”中的那种乐观的信心，“胜利”中的那种自由的欢乐，都很生动、深刻地传达给听众了。
    优秀的演唱艺术的第一个特点是一切发声技术服从于语言的表达。纳赛罗娃的演唱清楚地说明这一点。那种主张“美声就是一切”的人们，本质上是企图降低音乐的内容、诗的语言的意义。中国古人反对“因辞害意”，在声乐演唱上也同样适用这句格言。
    优秀的演唱艺术的第二个特点是一切演唱技术服从于情感的表达。纳赛罗娃的演唱在这方面是很好的典范，听过纳赛罗娃演唱的人，没有不被她那情感、气势所征服的。她所演唱的一切，因为她自己是那么坚信，因而也就有着最大的说服力量。
    纳赛罗娃在我国首都演唱的另一重意义，那就是在发展和提高民族风格的演唱方法上给我们的启示。
    我国的声乐界曾经为了所谓洋嗓子和土嗓子的问题而争论，在若干方面虽也有了比较一致的意见，但如何提高和发展民族唱法以建立系统的训练方法和演唱的艺术学派，还没有明确可行的方案。因而，纳赛罗娃所走过的道路，应当是我们最好的借鉴。
    我们知道，纳赛罗娃曾经以一个民族歌者的身份到莫斯科音乐院学习。这其间，他主要是学习音乐科学的全般知识，包括音乐史、作家研究等理论课程以及和声、对位等技术理论课程。用名作曲家查哈罗夫的话来说：“这是丰富了她的音乐知识，培养了她的审美观点，更重要的是建立了正确的音乐鉴赏能力”。这也就是说，重要的在于武装起全部的音乐科学知识，不是急切的去用另一种完全不同的演唱学派的发声法、表现技术等来代替她原有的方法。而是在她获得必需的音乐知识之后，由她自觉地去吸收她自己认为合适的东西，就是说，和她原有的方法不相矛盾的东西。所以，当纳赛罗娃在音乐院学习终了，回到故乡演唱时，最初，人们曾奇怪地询问：“她何必去莫斯科学习呢？唱的还不是跟从前一样！”这说明了很重要的一点，就是纳赛罗娃经过学院式的学习以后，她没有去掉她原有的演唱方法，只是提高了她原有的演唱方法，她所具有的那种演唱上的民族风格并没有丝毫的改变。
    这种做法给我们很大的启示。我国的音乐界应该进一步讨论这个问题，拟出具体的方案，来训练自己的民族学派的歌唱家，提高、发展我们的音乐演唱艺术。
