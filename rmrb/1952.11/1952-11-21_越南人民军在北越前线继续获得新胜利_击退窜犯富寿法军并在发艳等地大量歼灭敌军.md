Xinhua News Agency, North Vietnam, November 19th: The Vietnam People's Army has continuously achieved new victories on various fronts in North Vietnam.

On the Phu Tho front, the Vietnam People's Army annihilated a large number of the invading French army's active forces. The French troops who intruded into Phu Tho are currently in retreat. In multiple battles to intercept the French troops intruding into Phu Tho, the Vietnam People's Army killed 300 French officers and soldiers, wounded 200, and sank two barges fully loaded with French troops, severely damaging one French gunboat and four barges.

Having suffered severe losses, the French army began to withdraw from Đoan Hùng (between Phu Tho and Tuyên Quang) on November 15th. The People's Army intercepted this French infantry force, consisting of fifteen trucks, 18 kilometers south of Đoan Hùng, annihilating 450 French troops and destroying all fifteen trucks.

In the Third Interzone of the Red River Delta, the Vietnam People's Army attacked the Phát Diệm area of Ninh Bình province, more than 100 kilometers south of Hanoi. On the evening of November 8th, they captured Tuy Lộc and Phương Nại, wiping out two French companies. On the evening of November 13th, they destroyed the French stronghold of Hải Sư, annihilating all the French troops within the stronghold. In the area of An Bình-Tuy Lộc, they annihilated one company of European and African soldiers from the French 26th Battalion, as well as a portion of the battalion's staff. On November 14th, the French army dispatched a battalion of reinforcements from Nam Định, traveling on four gunboats. The People's Army intercepted the French gunboat convoy from pre-arranged positions on both banks of the Đáy River, sinking three of the gunboats, severely damaging the remaining one, annihilating most of the French troops on the gunboats, and capturing all the remaining French troops who fled ashore.

On the Black River front, after liberating Quỳnh Nhai at the end of October, the People's Army crossed the Black River and continued to advance. On the 19th, the invading French army entrenched in Luân Châu, under the strong pressure of the Vietnam People's Army, retreated in a panic towards Tuần Giáo. The People's Army intercepted this French force, routing one of its companies.

During the same period, the Vietnam People's Army launched coordinated battles in Hưng Yên province, south of Hanoi. On November 11th, they eliminated a French stronghold, capturing 50 Bảo Đại puppet troops.
