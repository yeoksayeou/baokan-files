     Datong Coal Mine
    Trials Combine Coal Mining Machine
    Our country's first Soviet-style coal mining machine - the Donbas Model One coal mining combine - under the personal guidance of Soviet experts, was successfully tested in coal mining at the Datong Coal Mine in early November. This is a harbinger of further mechanization in China's coal mine construction. The coal mining combine is equipped with coal cutting, coal crushing, and coal loading equipment, which can replace all the heavy manual labor in coal mining with machines, thereby completely improving the working conditions of miners. According to the recent test results, one and a half cycles of operation can now be carried out every day, with a daily output of 315.65 tons of coal. If preparatory work is improved in a timely manner, two or even three cycles of operation can be achieved every day, and the daily output can reach 430 tons or even 650 tons.
    This trial work also trained the first batch of more than 30 combine drivers for coal mines in Guannei (areas within Shanhaiguan). In September, the Coal Mine Management Bureau of the Central Ministry of Fuel Industry held a "Combine Driver Training Class" at the Datong Coal Mine, with 16 coal miners from both Datong and Shandong mines participating. After more than two months of technical theoretical study, ground operation, and recent underground practice, they have basically learned the technology of driving the combine and have a preliminary understanding of its structure and repair methods, preparing talent for the further promotion of combine coal mining.

     大同煤矿
    试用康拜因机采煤
    我国关内第一部苏联最新式的采煤机械——顿巴斯一型采煤康拜因机，在苏联专家的亲自指导下，已于十一月初在大同煤矿试验采煤成功。这是新中国煤矿建设进一步走向机械化的先声。采煤康拜因机装有截煤、粉碎煤、装煤等三种设备，可以使机器代替采煤工作中全部繁重的手工劳动，从而彻底改善矿工的劳动条件。根据最近试用的结果，每天已可进行一个半循环作业，日产煤三百十五点六五吨。如及时改进准备工作，很快就可达到每天进行两个以至三个循环作业，日产量就可达到四百三十吨以至六百五十吨。
    这次试验工作，同时为关内煤矿培养了第一批康拜因司机手三十多人。九月份，中央燃料工业部煤矿管理总局在大同煤矿举办了“康拜因司机训练班”，参加的有大同、山东两矿的煤矿工人各十六人，他们经过两个多月的技术理论学习、地面操纵和最近的井下实习，已基本上学会了驾驶康拜因的技术，并初步懂得了它的构造和修理办法，为进一步推广康拜因机采煤准备了人材。  （新华社）
