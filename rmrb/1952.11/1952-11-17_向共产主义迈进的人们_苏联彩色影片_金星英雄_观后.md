People Marching Towards Communism
——After Watching the Soviet Color Film "Hero of the Golden Star"
Jia Ji

Screenwriter: Chirskov Director: Raizman Produced by the Lenin Order-winning Moscow Film Studio in 1950 Translated by the Northeast Film Studio of the Central Film Bureau in 1952. The great party of Lenin and Stalin is leading the Soviet people, confidently marching from today's socialism towards tomorrow's communism. The Soviet color film "Hero of the Golden Star," which won the first prize of the 1951 Stalin Literature and Art Award and the Grand Prize of the Sixth International Film Festival, is a work depicting this theme.

The film's protagonist, Hero of the Golden Star, Sergei, is a person who grew up in a socialist society and was tempered into a hero in the revolutionary war to defend the motherland, and also to defend world peace.

Initially, Sergei wanted to return to his hometown for a visit and then go to school for further studies, but after understanding the lives of the people there at the time, his first concern and attention was to push forward the backward life of his hometown, leading it towards the communist tomorrow. He abandoned his personal requests and participated in the construction of the power station to realize the demands of the broad masses. Just like living in a constantly advancing environment, Sergei's ideals and demands also improved. He thought day and night about the prospects for the future life of the people. This thinking can be seen from a conversation between him and his father. He said:

"I really want to see tomorrow, see the future. Tomorrow is a communist society. Think about it, when we build the power station, all the villages will have electric lights. With electric lights, there will be too many things that need to be built. Take farming for example, our Lagulin is the most experienced, and he still says that a good harvest depends on not having natural disasters. Can we always rely on the heavens for food with our technology? We must find ways to conquer nature, plant trees and forests to prevent droughts, build reservoirs, dig canals, and build roads to make all the villages look new. This is what we need to lead everyone to do."

Such thinking is a positive force driving life forward. A prominent characteristic of Sergei is his foresight. When he talks with his childhood friend, the current engineer Victor, he says that building a power station is for the future. He says that mechanization and electrification should not only be applied to cities, but should also be developed in rural areas. We should not treat the countryside as just a place for summer vacations, as in the past, but realize rural electrification and eliminate the state of opposition between cities and the countryside. This is precisely the ideal of communism.

In order to realize this grand and lofty ideal, the film profoundly and comprehensively depicts the protagonist's heart and character through the relationship between people. When he saw Simeon, who was temporarily stagnant in the slow current of life, only planning for the small family life, he pointed out to Simeon: "You build a house for yourself and live comfortably here, what will happen in the future? Is such a life enough? Life is like a river, with both rapid currents and slow currents. You are now caught in the slow current. I want to pull you into the rapid current and advance side by side with me..." Such serious and kind advice persuaded Simeon, the comrade who charged alongside him on the front lines, to also participate in the construction of the power station.

Sergei never compromises with all the difficulties and obstacles in life and resolutely fights against them. This is especially evident in his relationship with the original district chairman of Roshen, He Haolakoff. In many occasions, Sergei always takes the position of the Party and the collective interests to fight against He Haolakoff, who is unwilling to face life and the interests of the masses. Sergei has pointed out He Haolakoff's serious mistakes more than once, that he is willing to fall behind life, satisfied with the status quo, and not seeking progress. Here, Sergei showed a serious attitude towards dealing with people and things.

Sergei not only treats others with a high degree of principle, but also treats himself with the same attitude. In the scene where he handled the requests for wood from various villages to prepare for the construction of the power station, Sergei's thinking at that time could not keep up with the demands of the masses. However, when he realized that the plan for building the power station should be expanded from one village to a district, he immediately happily accepted this advanced suggestion, bravely corrected his mistakes, agreed to the demands of the masses, and took the lead in striving to complete this new plan.

The other advanced figures in the film also have communist ideas and moral qualities, excellent character, and a beautiful heart. The film vividly depicts the unique faces of each of their characters. The film depicts Irina, the protagonist's lover, a new type of Soviet rural girl, who is humble and constantly learning. It is precisely because of this that she has transformed from a cart-driving girl into a dispatcher who can master advanced science and technology.

However, in real life, there are also some backward people who are stagnant in the "slow current of life." They either are content with the status quo and willingly fall behind, or are selfish and wasteful of public property, lacking ideals; or are obsessed with a small world for personal happiness; or only plan for their own village and ignore the interests of the entire region and the entire country… They have a negative effect on the cause of communist construction, and their thoughts and behaviors are obstacles to the progress of life.

The original district chairman of Roshen in the film, He Haolakoff, is a typical example of a backward person. He demonstrates the ideological characteristics of backward figures among Soviet peasants at that time. He is satisfied with the achievements he has already made and lacks enthusiasm for new things. Therefore, he not only does not support the suggestion of developing Wuxi Village into a wealthy and beautiful ideal, but instead says it is "dreaming." And for the progressive measure of the advanced farm chairman Lagulin to reclaim the land cultivated by individual farmers, he not only does not praise him, but instead accuses him of "why did you implement communism ahead of time!" Obviously, such a person is not only unable to lead the masses to advance towards a new life, but instead becomes a stumbling block to the progress of life. He has praised crops incessantly, expressing that he seems to be concerned about production, but he is indifferent to the great construction of rural electrification, dissatisfied with digging canals and other works, and even fiercely opposes the production increase plan proposed by Lagulin.

Because of these serious mistakes, a hero who once "defended the Soviet motherland with a saber" has stagnated in the face of the new life. When he asked Irina whether Sergei "disliked" her for being backward, and Irina replied that she "can catch up," and in the several shots that followed depicting him, people can see how small and lonely this character is! The film powerfully reveals this point, which is of profound educational significance.

The film excellently shapes the image of a Party leader - District Committee Secretary Gandradieff. In the major plots and events depicted in the film, and in the thoughts and lives of the characters, people can see the role he plays. In accordance with the needs of the development of life and the overall perspective of the national construction plan, he first supports the development plan of Wuxi Village and expands the work of building a power station from one village to the scope of a district. It is precisely through these that he arouses people's greater life ideals among the masses, opens up a broader field of life for them, elevates their thinking to a higher realm, and at the same time raises people's work ability and labor conditions to the level they should be, preparing the conditions for victoriously embarking on the road to communism.

The image of Gandradieff depicted in the film is profound and moving. His serious attitude towards life is naturally linked to his enthusiasm for people and his approachable appearance. This simple person is very capable and good at turning the Party's policies into people's actions in practice. This is mainly because he is familiar with life, goes deep into reality, he believes in the masses, understands the masses, and relies on the masses. In the scene where he instructs Sergei on how to realize the Wuxi Village construction plan, what he particularly emphasizes is: "You have to discuss with the masses. No matter how good one person thinks, it is just an ideal; when this ideal becomes the ideal of the masses, then a great cause can be created." It is precisely in this way, precisely by following the mass line, closely linking with the masses, and the work style of trusting the strength of the masses, that the two major tasks of spring plowing and wiring were successfully completed at the same time in the most tense and busy days that followed.

Trusting the masses and relying on the masses is one aspect. Another major responsibility of leaders is to walk ahead of the masses and correctly lead the masses to advance continuously. Gandradieff has a keen sense of new things, and he has foresight. In the current state of development of things, he has keenly foreseen what should be done in the next stage. Before the power station was built, he said to Sergei: "We need to mechanize, mechanization is a new level of culture. We need engineers, agronomists and intellectuals from the collective farms." He not only saw this urgent need, but also proposed to train intellectuals in the process of building the power station. He said: "We must train in the midst of busyness," because: "Construction itself is a university. We should absorb a large number of activists, young people, and members of the Youth League, and educate the masses..." In this way, he led the masses forward.

When people see electric tractors cultivating the land and electric sprinklers irrigating the fields, when people see that the labor of shearing sheep and milking cows, which has always been done by hand, is all done with electricity, people can understand that labor conditions are being thoroughly improved. When people see that collective farms have thousands of electric lights illuminating the night and illuminating the road of farm life, when people see that those Soviet people are seeking knowledge and studying hard in order to open up this new road of life, people can even more see that people's material and spiritual life is infinitely enriched. All of this shows that electrification is fundamentally transforming the face of the countryside, transforming the economic, cultural, and spiritual aspects of people's lives; it shows that the definition given by the great revolutionary teacher Lenin to communism [Note], the ideal blueprint of communism, is beginning to rapidly transform from the Soviet land into a beautiful reality.

The reality of the great Soviet Union is precisely the tomorrow of our great motherland. In the magnificent picture of the power station being built, we see how beautiful and happy such a social life is! How meaningful and valuable it is to strive for such a life!

"Hero of the Golden Star" is an excellent film, a textbook on communist thought that we should study.

[Note] Lenin said: "Communism equals Soviet power plus electrification of the whole country." (Image attached)

    向共产主义迈进的人们
    ——苏联彩色影片“金星英雄”观后
    贾霁
    编剧：奇尔斯科夫　导演：莱兹曼　联荣膺列宁勋章之莫斯科电影制片厂一九五○年出品中央电影局东北电影制片厂一九五二年译制伟大的列宁、斯大林的党，正领导着苏联人民，满怀信心地从社会主义的今日，走向共产主义的明天。荣膺了一九五一年斯大林文艺奖金一等奖、第六届国际电影节特等奖的苏联彩色影片“金星英雄”，便是描写这一主题的作品。
    影片主人公金星英雄谢拉杰，是一个在社会主义社会里教养长大的，在保卫祖国，同时也是保卫世界和平的革命战争中锻炼成为英雄的人。
    当初，谢拉杰曾经是想回乡看看就进学校求深造的，但当他了解了当时当地的人民生活以后，他首先关心和注意的就是要把落后了的故乡生活推向前进，引向共产主义的明天。他打消了个人的要求，为实现广大群众的要求参加到修建发电站的工作中来了。像生活在不息地前进一样，谢拉杰的理想与要求也提高了。他日以继夜地在思考着未来的人民生活的远景，这种思想，从他和他父亲的一段对话里可以看出来。他说：
    “我真想看见明天，看见将来。明天是共产主义社会。你想想我们把发电站修建起来，各村都点了电灯，有了电灯，需要建设的东西就太多了。你说种地吧，我们的拉古林是最有经验的了，还说要不闹天灾才能丰收。难道说就靠我们的技术还能永远靠天吃饭？我们要想办法征服自然，植树造林预防旱灾，修蓄水池、挖运河、修道路，使各村都焕然一新。这就是要领大家做的事情。”
    这样的思想是推动生活的积极力量。谢拉杰的突出的一个特征是他有远见。当他和他的幼年时代的伙伴、现在的工程师维克道尔谈话时，他就说建立发电站是为了将来。他说机械化和电气化，不只是应该应用于城市，而且应该发展到农村。不应该像过去一样把乡村只当做避暑的地方，而要实现农村电气化，使城市与农村的对立的状态消灭。这正是共产主义的理想。
    为了实现这一远大的崇高的理想，影片通过了人与人的关系，深刻地、多方面地描绘了主人公的心灵和他的性格。当他看到了那一时停滞在生活的缓流里的席妙恩，在只为小家庭生活打算的时候，他就向席妙恩指出：“你自己盖一所房子，在这儿逍遥自在地过小日子，将来怎么办呢？难道这样的生活就满足了吗？生活就好像一条河，河有急流，也有缓流，你现在是卷进了缓流。我是想把你拉进急流来，和我并肩前进……”这样严肃而亲切的劝告，说服了席妙恩，这位和他一道在火线上冲锋陷阵的战友也参加建设发电站的工作了。
    谢拉杰对生活中的所有困难与障碍，是决不调和地与之进行斗争的。这特别表现在他和罗申区原来的区主席赫郝拉柯夫的关系上。在许多场合里，谢拉杰总是以党的、集体利益的立场，向那不肯正视生活、正视群众利益的赫郝拉柯夫进行斗争。谢拉杰不止一次地指出了赫郝拉柯夫的严重错误，是甘愿落在生活的后面，满足于现状，不求进步。在这里，谢拉杰表现了严肃的待人接物的态度。
    谢拉杰不但以高度的原则性对待别人，也以同样的态度对待自己。当他处理各村都来要求木料，准备修建发电站的那一段戏里，谢拉杰当时的思想是跟不上群众要求的。但是，当他认识了应把修建发电站的计划，由一村扩大为一个区后，他立即愉快地接受了这一先进的建议，勇敢地改正了自己的错误，答应了群众的要求，并且带头为完成这一新的计划而努力。
    影片中其他的先进人物，也同样地具有共产主义的思想和道德品质、优秀的性格和美好的心灵。影片色彩鲜明地描绘了他们各个人物的独特面貌。影片描写了主人公的爱人伊里娜这一新型的苏联农村姑娘，她谦逊并不断学习。正是由于这样，她由一个赶牛车的姑娘，变为能掌握先进科学技术的配电员。
    但是，在现实生活中，也有一些落后的、停滞在“生活的缓流”里的人，他们或者安于现状，自甘落后；或者自私自利，浪费公共财产，缺乏理想；或者为了个人幸福而醉心于小天地里；或者只为自己村庄打算而忽视整个地区、整个国家的利益……他们对共产主义建设事业有消极作用，他们的思想和行为是生活前进中的阻力。
    影片中的罗申区原来的区主席赫郝拉柯夫，是一个落后人物的典型。他表现了当时苏维埃农民中落后人物的思想特征。他满足于已有的成就，对新鲜事物缺乏热情。所以，他对发展乌溪村成为富有的美好理想的建议，不仅不支持，反而说那是“做梦”。而对于先进的农庄主席拉古林收回农民个体耕作的土地的进步措施，不仅不予表扬，反而责备他“为什么提前实行了共产主义！”显然，这样的人，是不仅不能领导群众向新的生活前进，相反是成为生活前进的绊脚石了。他曾不绝口地赞美过庄稼，表示似乎是在关心生产，但对农村电气化这一伟大建设冷淡，对挖运河等等工作不满，以至对拉古林提出的增产计划，激烈地加以反对。
    由于这些严重错误，就使得一位当年曾“用一把军刀保卫苏维埃祖国”的英雄，在新的生活面前停滞下来。当他向伊里娜提出谢拉杰“嫌”她落后，而伊里娜回答“能够赶得上”的时候，以及紧接着描写他的几个镜头里，人们可以看见：这个人物是多么渺小、孤单！影片有力地揭露了这一点，这是有深刻教育意义的。
    影片很好地塑造了一个党的领导者的形象——区委书记甘德拉吉耶夫。在影片中所描写的重大情节和事变中，在人物的思想和生活中，人们都可以看见他所起的作用。他依照生活发展的需要，和国家建设计划的全面观点，首先支持乌溪村的发展计划，并将修建发电站的工作，从一个村扩大到一个区的范围去。正是通过这些，他在群众中唤起人们更远大的生活理想，打开他们更广阔的生活领域，把他们的思想提升到更高的境界，同时也把人们的工作能力和劳动条件提到应有的水平，为胜利地走上共产主义的道路准备了条件。
    影片描写的甘德拉吉耶夫的形象，是深刻的、动人的。他对待生活的严肃态度，与他对人的热情和令人可亲的面貌，很自然地连结在一起。这个朴实的人，表现得非常干练，善于在实际上把党的政策变为人的行动。这主要是因为他熟悉生活，深入实际，他相信群众，了解群众，并依靠群众。在他向谢拉杰指示怎样实现乌溪村建设计划的那一段戏里，他所特别着重指出的是：“要和群众商量。一个人
    想的不论怎么好，究竟是一个理想；当这个理想变成群众的理想的时候，那才能够产生出来伟大的事业。”正是这样，正是走群众路线，密切联系群众、信任群众力量的工作作风，在此后最紧张繁忙的日子里，把春耕与架线两大任务同时顺利地完成了。
    信任群众，依靠群众，这是一方面。领导者另一方面的重大责任，是走在群众前头，正确地领导群众不息地前进。甘德拉吉耶夫有对于新事物的敏锐感觉，有预见。在事物发展的目前状态中，他已经敏锐地预见到下一个阶段应该做些什么了。在发电站还没修好之前，他对谢拉杰说：“我们要机械化，机械化是一个新的文化水平。我们需要工程师、农业家和集体农庄的知识分子。”他不但看到了这样的迫切需要，并且提出了就在修建发电站的过程中培养知识分子。他说：“就要在忙的当中培养，”因为：“修建本身就是大学校。我们应该大量地吸收积极分子、青年们和团员，要教育群众……”就这样，他领导群众前进了。
    当人们看见电力拖拉机在耕耘土地、电力喷水器在灌溉田园的时候，当人们看见剪羊毛、挤牛奶这一些从来是用手的劳动全都应用了电力的时候，人们可以了解：劳动条件是在彻底地改善了。当人们看见集体农庄有了千万盏电灯照亮了黑夜、照亮了农庄生活道路的时候，当人们看见那些苏维埃人民为开拓这条新的生活道路而寻求知识、努力学习的时候，人们更可以看出：人的物质和精神生活是无限地丰富起来了。这一切，说明了：电气化是在根本上改造着农村面貌，改造着人民经济生活、文化生活以及精神各方面的面貌；说明了：伟大革命导师列宁给共产主义所下的定义〔注〕，共产主义理想底图样，正开始迅速地从苏联国土上变为美妙的现实了。
    伟大苏联的现实，正是我们伟大祖国的明天。在那发电站修建起来的壮丽画面里，我们看到了那样的社会生活是多么美好，多么幸福！为这样的生活而努力又是多么有意义，有价值！
    “金星英雄”是一部优秀影片，是一部我们应该学习的有关共产主义思想的教科书。
