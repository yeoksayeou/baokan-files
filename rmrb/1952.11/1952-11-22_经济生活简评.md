    We Must Continue to Strengthen the Forces of Railway Capital Construction

    With the impending arrival of large-scale economic construction, the task of building new railways in the future will be extremely heavy. More than 800 kilometers of railways will be built next year. However, as with other industrial sectors, the strength of the railway system's capital construction is also weak and cannot meet objective requirements.

    In order to solve this problem, the Ministry of Railways convened a national railway planning conference in June this year, clearly putting forward the policy of placing capital construction in a primary position. It resolutely transferred management cadres and technical personnel from railway administrations across the country to capital construction departments, thereby initially enriching and adjusting the capital construction organizations, and strengthening the forces of surveying, design, and construction. As a result, construction could begin on the southern section of the Tianshui-Chengdu Railway and the eastern section of the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway, and technical designs required for the Tianshui-Chengdu Railway and the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway were made, increasing confidence in completing the task of building new railways next year. This shows that strengthening leadership, mobilizing cadres, and enriching capital construction organizations are the primary tasks for overcoming the weakness of capital construction forces and carrying out capital construction preparations.

    However, it must be pointed out that the institutions already established by the Ministry of Railways are not yet sound enough. The personnel of the eighteen survey and design corps have not yet been fully equipped, and the quality of personnel in some survey and design corps is extremely low, and they cannot yet meet the needs of survey and design work. The reason for this situation is mainly because the leading cadres of some railway administrations have not established the idea of placing capital construction in a primary position. Although they have transferred some cadres and technical personnel to the capital construction departments, they are still dragging their feet and unable to act quickly from the perspective of their own interests, and they are unwilling to transfer the most outstanding cadres, technical personnel, and skilled workers to the capital construction departments. Therefore, how to quickly transfer cadres and technical personnel to new line engineering units, and how to make the capital construction organization of the railway system the most powerful organization, is still the current goal of the railway system's struggle.

    The Ministry of Railways has made a good start in implementing the policy of placing capital construction in a primary position. All railway administrations should continue to work hard, break down departmentalism, recognize the importance of railway construction in the future, regard the transfer of cadres as their glorious and important task, and strive to complete the extremely important railway construction in the future.

    必须继续加强铁路基本建设的力量
    随着大规模经济建设的即将到来，今后新建铁路的任务是十分繁重的。明年要修建的铁路就有八百多公里。但是和其他工业部门的情况一样，铁路系统基本建设的力量也很薄弱，不能满足客观的要求。
    为了解决这个问题，铁道部在今年六月召开全国铁路计划会议，明确地提出了把基本建设放在首要地位的方针，果断地从全国各铁路管理局抽调管理干部、技术人员，输送到基本建设部门，从而初步充实和调整了基本建设的机构，增强了勘测、设计和施工的力量，因此就能在天（水）成（都）铁路南段、兰（州）新（疆）铁路东段开始施工，并做出了天成铁路和兰新铁路所需要的技术设计，为完成明年新修铁路的任务增加了信心。这说明了加强领导、调集干部、充实基本建设机构，乃是克服基本建设力量薄弱，进行基本建设准备工作的首要任务。
    但是必须指出：铁道部已经成立的机构还不够健全，十八个勘测设计总队的人员还没有配备齐全，有些勘测设计总队的人员质量极低，还不能满足勘测设计工作的需要。这种情况所以发生，主要是因为有些铁路管理局的领导干部没有树立起把基本建设放在首要地位的思想。他们虽然向基本建设部门输送了一些干部和技术人员，但他们从本位利益出发，总还拖泥带水地不能迅速地行动起来，不愿意把最优秀的干部、技术人员和技术工人输送给基本建设部门。因之如何迅速地向新线工程单位输送干部和技术人员，如何使铁路系统基本建设的机构成为最强大的机构，还是目前铁路系统的奋斗目标。
    铁道部在贯彻把基本建设放在首要地位的方针中，已经做出了良好的开端。各铁路管理局应该继续努力，打破本位思想，认清今后铁路建设的重要性，把抽调干部当为自己的光荣的重要的任务，为完成今后极其重大的铁路建设而斗争。
