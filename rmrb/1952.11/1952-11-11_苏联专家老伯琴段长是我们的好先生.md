    Soviet Expert Comrade Lobokhin, Section Chief, is Our Good Teacher

    To the Editor: Under the enthusiastic help of Soviet expert Comrade Lobokhin, section chief of the Mudanjiang Railway Bureau's electrical section, we have learned sixteen advanced Soviet experiences in railway management, achieved great success in our work, and accumulated 4 billion yuan in wealth for the country.

    Last March, our section began implementing the economic accounting system. At that time, we did not know how to do it and thought that implementing the economic accounting system was just a reform of the accounting system. Later, Soviet expert Comrade Lobokhin patiently explained it to us, gave us large lectures, and taught us about the relevant issues of implementing the economic accounting system. At that time, there was a lot of backlog of materials in the section, which affected the turnover of working capital. Comrade Lobokhin was very anxious when he saw this situation. He took the initiative to contact various parties and promote sales to state-owned enterprises, and finally reduced the backlog of materials to the required quantity. In order to improve the technical level of our employees, he personally set up a technical research office in the section and opened advanced work method training classes. There was a steel bridge erection pole project. After construction started, the progress was very slow due to limitations in manpower and materials. He personally went to the site six or seven li away to guide the work, so that the project was successfully completed.

    Comrade Lobokhin helps us meticulously with a high degree of internationalism. In addition to expressing our deep gratitude to him, we are determined to learn more from the advanced Soviet experience.

    苏联专家老伯琴段长是我们的好先生
    编辑同志：牡丹江铁路分局电务段，在苏联专家老伯琴段长的热心帮助下，学会了十六种苏联管理铁路的先进经验，工作获得了很大成绩，并为国家积累了四十亿元的财富。
    去年三月我段开始实行经济核算制，当时我们不知道怎样做，认为实行经济核算制只是改革会计制度。后来苏联专家老伯琴同志耐心地给我们讲解，上大课，教我们学习实行经济核算制的有关问题。那时候段内积压的材料很多，影响了流动资金的周转，老伯琴段长看到这种情况非常着急，他主动地和各方面联系，和向国营企业推销，终于把积压的材料压缩到合乎规定的数量。为了提高我们职工的技术水平，他亲自在段内设立了技术研究室，并开办了先进工作法训练班。有一个铁桥架设电杆工程，开工后由于人力、材料的限制，进度很慢，他就亲自到六、七里以外的现场去指导工作，使工程顺利完成。
    老伯琴同志以高度的国际主义精神，无微不至地帮助我们，我们除深切地感谢他外，决心多多学习苏联先进经验。    张希贤
