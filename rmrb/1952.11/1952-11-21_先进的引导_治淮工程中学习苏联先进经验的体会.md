    Advanced Guidance
    – Experiences in Learning from the Soviet Union's Advanced Experience in the Huai River Project
    Qian Zhengying, Deputy Director of the Engineering Department of the Huai River Project Committee
    Two years ago, Premier Zhou of the State Council of the Central People's Government, when explaining the basic principles and current tasks of the Huai River Project, emphasized to our technical personnel: This is a completely new task, and it is not the same as the "guiding the Huai River" in old China; only by resolutely eliminating the outdated technical viewpoints of the bourgeoisie, using the advanced experience of the Soviet Union as guidance, and combining it with the actual conditions of the Huai River, can we create revolutionary engineering and realize Chairman Mao's great call to "ensure that the Huai River is harnessed well." Over the past two years, under the leadership and assistance of the higher authorities and in the labor practices of millions of people, we have deeply realized the correctness of this instruction and recognized that to correctly carry out China's new water conservancy construction, it is necessary to firmly learn from the Soviet Union in both planning ideology and construction technology. Now, I will talk about my personal experience in this regard.

    I. Advanced Planning Ideology

    Over the past two years, the most pressing question for everyone has been: Can the engineering plans we have formulated reflect Chairman Mao's great intention?

    The State Council of the Central People's Government clearly stipulated that the basic principles of the Huai River Project are to combine storage and drainage, jointly protect the three provinces, and integrate disaster prevention with benefit promotion. However, how to correctly understand and implement this policy was quite confusing in the minds of some of our personnel. Personally, I studied American textbooks in the past. American water conservancy textbooks also mentioned that the new direction of water conservancy construction should be multi-objective development and basin-wide planning. However, under the capitalist social system, water is also seized as private property. How can this planning principle be implemented? In the United States, from the world-famous TVA (Tennessee Valley Authority, a large hydropower station in the United States, located in Tennessee) to any river, water sources are divided and seized, and water conservancy projects only serve this narrow purpose, so there is no such thing as basin-wide planning or multi-objective development. Based on such practices, its textbooks, in addition to vaguely proposing a principle, cannot provide specific knowledge on how to analyze, calculate, and coordinate the allocation of water sources. The old Chinese water conservancy plans under the influence of this ideology, from the Huai River guidance plan of American "water conservancy expert" Freeman, the Yellow River governance plan of German "water conservancy expert" Engels, to the Kuomintang Huai River guidance plan under the guidance of German "expert" Franzius, were basically to send the water to the sea. All we learned were some empty concepts.

    I remember that before the official start of the Huai River Project, some of our staff drafted a Huai River governance plan. According to the flood volume in 1950, the plan was to use lakes and depressions in the upper and middle reaches to store 7 billion cubic meters of floodwater, while expanding the main riverbed in the middle reaches and opening up channels to the sea in the lower reaches to discharge the floodwater that could not be stored. At that time, Soviet expert Comrade Bukov had just returned to Beijing after his vacation. I explained the plan to him and asked him to help with the work.

    "Is 'ensuring that the Huai River is harnessed well' as proposed by Chairman Mao only this?" he asked, and then said: "That's not what I think. I am thinking – building a large number of valley reservoirs in the upper reaches, making better use of lakes and depressions to store water in the middle reaches, and taking other measures to require the comprehensive control and utilization of all the water given by nature on the vast land of the Huai River basin. Not only to eliminate floods, but also to develop irrigation on a large scale, improve navigation, and build hydropower stations. Only after the water has done all its work, then send it to the sea." He pointed to the map of the Huai River on the wall and the irrigation pictures of the Soviet Union hanging side by side, and said enthusiastically: "This is how I understand 'ensuring that the Huai River is harnessed well' as proposed by Chairman Mao."

    However, in the past, I and some other technical personnel had blindly accepted some old traditional views, such as: (1) The sources of the Huai River are scattered and not suitable for building reservoirs. (2) Disaster relief first, then benefit promotion. Irrigation is not very urgent for areas south of the Yellow River in our country. The Soviet Union is afraid of drought, but China is afraid of floods. (3) Due to the limitations of our country's conditions, large-scale sluice gate projects are currently impossible to build, let alone be completed in the short term.

    Comrade Bukov's opinion caused a great shock to my thinking. I wavered between the two views, and I often struggled: "What exactly does it mean to harness the Huai River well?" Later, during the on-site investigation and research process, Comrade Bukov helped us solve the following problems: (1) Although the sources of the Huai River are scattered, it is possible and necessary to build valley reservoirs, otherwise the flood problem in the upper reaches cannot be solved. (2) Even in water-rich areas like northern Jiangsu, irrigation is still necessary to ensure agricultural production. The layout of projects should solve the problems of disaster relief and benefit promotion at the same time, rather than separating these two issues. (3) Under the existing conditions in our country, large-scale sluice gate projects are possible to build and can be completed in a short period of time.

    Our views were defeated one by one. I began to realize that although Comrade Bukov was a Soviet, he understood Chairman Mao's great call and the State Council's instructions on the Huai River Project more correctly. While carrying out the first year of the project, we further conducted large-scale surveys and measurements, and sorted out and analyzed the hydrological data of the Huai River. Under the correct leadership of the Huai River Project Committee and with the kind help of Comrade Bukov, our technical personnel worked hard to study how to implement the socialist direction of water conservancy construction in the Huai River planning, and drafted the current ambitious draft plan for the Huai River Project.

    II. Advanced Construction Ideology

    The Huai River Project requires the completion of large-scale sluice gate construction. In the era of Kuomintang reactionary rule, building a Huaiyin ship lock was considered a huge project, requiring a large number of wooden piles, steel sheet piles, steel bars, and cement, requiring a large number of technical personnel, requiring more than two years, and ordering sluice gates from foreign factories. And the construction of the Hongze Lake control sluice (called the Sanhe movable dam in the Kuomintang's Huai River guidance plan) was even called a unique project in China. It had been under construction for two years, but only a part of the foundation piles were driven. The Huai River Project needs to complete hundreds of buildings of the same scale as the Huaiyin ship lock, and several buildings of the same scale as the Sanhe movable dam. In addition, it is also necessary to complete more than ten reservoirs with dam heights of more than 20 meters to 60 meters, and large-scale irrigation water transmission systems, power stations, pumping stations, and other buildings. These projects are all required to be completed within five years, and dozens of large buildings need to be completed every year. The construction time of general buildings is not a few years, but a few months. Obviously, the old construction technology cannot meet our needs. Soviet experts introduced us to a series of advanced construction technologies, which enabled us to overcome the difficulties smoothly.

    The design of sluice gate projects strives for economy and rationality. Comrade Bukov visited the Huaiyin ship lock and exclaimed: "The engineer who designed such a project seems to think that China has too much steel!" He introduced us to advanced experience such as not using foundation piles and not using sheet piles, and encouraged and helped us to manufacture various sluice gates in our own factories. While working with us, he was even more careful and calculated everywhere, striving to save money. A large amount of wood, steel, and cement was saved, the construction time was greatly shortened, and there was no need to order goods from abroad. In 1953 alone, 25 large sluice gate buildings will be completed in the northern Jiangsu area. The new Hongze Lake control sluice, which was redesigned by the Northern Jiangsu Huai River Project Headquarters, is 700 meters long and started construction in October of this year, and is expected to be fully completed before the flood season next year.

    The construction of reservoirs is no longer considered mysterious and difficult. In the past, a few engineering personnel believed that: "If you don't build it, you don't build it. If you build it, you should build a concrete dam." However, Soviet experts pointed out: We are building dams to store water, not building dams for the sake of building dams. Earth dams, rockfill dams, concrete dams, and reinforced concrete dams can all solve problems under certain conditions. In order to save national funds, the principle of dam construction should be: build earth dams as much as possible; only build concrete dams where earth dams cannot be built; and only use reinforced steel where it is absolutely necessary. You can use earth instead of cement to build a dam, but you can never use earth without cement to build a steel factory; you can use masonry without reinforced steel to complete a water conservancy building, but you can never use cement and stone without steel to build a tractor. In the actual construction of reservoirs, Soviet experts Comrades Bukov and Sabaev helped us solve various difficult problems. With their kind help, the engineering personnel and administrative cadres of the Henan Province Huai River Project Headquarters have gradually learned the complete set of methods for reservoir design and construction, and can guarantee the completion of two to three reservoir projects every year.

    The more important gain in sluice gate construction projects is that Soviet experts helped our Chinese technical personnel open the "secrets" and greatly improved our national self-confidence and creative enthusiasm. After Soviet experts helped us overcome various technical difficulties in the past two years, engineers now have enough courage to face difficult engineering problems. The arch dam of the Foziling Reservoir, which is 60 to 70 meters high, and the high-pressure sluice gates of many reservoirs are complex works that old Chinese engineering personnel could not imagine, and are now being built.

    III. Further Study

    In the past two years, although we have achieved certain results in learning from the Soviet Union's advanced experience in the Huai River Project, it is still not enough.

    "Is Soviet technology advanced?" This question once existed in the minds of many technical personnel, thus hindering the development of the learning movement. For the general comrades, the actual achievements of our country's construction in various aspects in the past three years, especially the personal experience of participating in the Huai River Project in the past two years, have provided a strong answer to this question. However, there are still a few comrades who are divorced from the actual needs of the people and view technical issues in isolation. When they plan a project, they do not start from the overall situation, do not study the actual needs of the people, and do not use local conditions to meet these needs in the most economical way. Instead, they simply demand that the buildings they design be "modernized" and the design methods be "novel and profound." They ignore the specific conditions of time, place, and purpose, and simply believe that steel sluice gates are definitely more advanced than wooden sluice gates, concrete projects are definitely more advanced than earth and stone brick projects, complex formulas are definitely more advanced than simple formulas, and the more sophisticated the materials used in the project, the higher its evaluation. These are precisely the "technical standards" of capitalist countries.

    The work of Soviet experts is the opposite. They never dazzle personal skills, but only help us solve problems by applying the mature experience of their country in a pragmatic way. They first focus on studying the overall layout, and then consider the specific design of individual projects based on the overall requirements. They strive to use simple equipment and the people's existing technical experience to create projects that have the same effect. For example, the expansion joints of concrete projects in our country have always been made of copper sheets, but copper is not easy to obtain and is very expensive. After we told Comrade Bukov about this situation, he quickly found drawings of expansion joints made of various materials such as clay, wood chips, and zinc iron in his reference books, and told us that expansion joints in the Soviet Union are not made of copper sheets. Simply promoting the new method of making expansion joints in our country's construction projects can save the country a large amount of copper. Judging from the various problems that Soviet experts have helped us solve in the past two years, some people say that many experiences do not seem to contain particularly profound theories and can be learned by ordinary engineering personnel; some people say that although some problems are solved very cleverly at the time and place, "they are after all 'makeshift solutions' and are not enough to write papers for publication"; some people even say that a certain method has been mentioned in German books, Japanese books, or American books, but they have not paid attention to studying and adopting it in the past. However, it is these, from planning principles to detailed engineering guidance, that have comprehensively corrected our construction ideology, shortened the construction time, saved a large amount of funds, and ensured the safety and effectiveness of the project. It is these practical and ordinary ideas that contain a principle: the advancement of socialist science and technology. The large and small problems that Soviet experts have helped us solve specifically show how to apply the Marxist-Leninist position, viewpoint, and method to science and technology.

    Therefore, for us, learning from the Soviet Union's advanced experience is not just learning various specific technical methods, but should be carried out in conjunction with our own ideological transformation. Only by thoroughly eliminating the ideological influence of the bourgeoisie and establishing a revolutionary position, viewpoint, and method can we well accept the Soviet Union's advanced experience and apply it to practical work. At the same time, ideological transformation must also be supplemented by the study of the Soviet Union's advanced experience in order to better implement the results of ideological transformation into business work.

    When commemorating the 35th anniversary of the great October Revolution and launching the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month" activities, let us further launch a mass, systematic movement to learn from the Soviet Union's advanced experience to improve our work level and welcome the great construction of the motherland!

    先进的引导
    ——治淮工程中学习苏联先进经验的体会
    治淮委员会工程部副部长  钱正英
    两年前，中央人民政府政务院周总理在说明治淮的基本方针和当前任务时，曾对我们技术人员着重指出：这是一个完全新的任务，和旧中国的“导淮”没有丝毫相同之处；只有坚决清除资产阶级的陈旧的技术观点，以苏联的先进经验作为引导，结合淮河的实际情况，创造革命的工程，才能实现毛主席的“一定要把淮河修好”的伟大号召。两年来，在上级的领导和帮助下，在千百万群众的劳动实践中，我们深深体会到这一指示的英明正确，并认识到，要正确进行新中国的水利建设，必需从计划思想到建筑技术都坚定地向苏联学习。现在谈谈我个人在这方面的体会。
    一、先进的计划思想
    两年来，大家最焦虑的问题是：我们制订的工程计划能否体现毛主席的伟大意旨。
    中央人民政府政务院明确规定治淮的基本方针是蓄泄兼筹、三省共保、除害与兴利结合。但如何正确地认识和贯彻这一方针，在我们部分人员的思想上却相当混乱。就我个人来说，过去学的是美国课本。在美国的水利课本上，也提到水利建设的新方向应当是多目标的开发，全流域的规划。但是，在资本主义的社会制度下，水也被霸占作为私人的财富，如何能贯彻这个规划原则呢？在美国，从世界闻名的TVA（TVA即Tennessee    Valley    Autho-rity，是美国的大水电站，位于田纳西州。）到任何一条河流，水源都被分割霸占，水利工程只是服务于这种狭隘的目的，根本谈不上什么全流域的规划，多目标的开发。在这样的实践基础上，它的课本除了空洞地提出一个原则外，对如何分析计算、统筹分配水源，当然不能提供具体知识。在这种思想影响下的旧中国水利计划，从美国“水利名家”费礼门的导淮规划，德国“水利名家”恩格斯的治黄规划，到在德国“专家”方修斯指导下的国民党导淮规划，其基本内容都是将水送到大海。我们所学到的只是若干空洞的概念。
    记得在治淮工程正式开始前，我们部分工作人员曾拟订了一个治淮计划草案，按照一九五○年的洪水来量，计划在上、中游利用湖泊洼地蓄洪七十亿公方，同时扩大中游干流河床，在下游加开入海水道，将不能盛蓄的洪水泄送入海。那时苏联专家布可夫同志刚休假结束回到北京，我将计划讲给他听，并请他帮助工作。
    “毛主席提出的‘一定要把淮河修好’仅仅是这些吗？”他问道，并接着说道：“我想的不是这样。我想着——在上游修建大量的山谷水库，在中游更好地利用湖泊洼地蓄水，并采取其他措施，要求在淮河流域的广大土地上，将大自然所给的水全盘控制利用。不但消除水灾，并且大规模地发展灌溉事业，改进航运，建设水电站。只有当水做完它所有的工作后，才将它送到海里。”他指着墙上的淮河地图和并列挂着的苏联的灌溉图画，热情地说道：“毛主席提出的‘一定要把淮河修好’，我是这样理解的。”
    但过去我和其他一些技术人员却曾经盲目地接受了某些旧的传统见解，如：（一）淮河源流分散，不宜建筑水库。（二）先除灾而后兴利。灌溉对于我国黄河以南地区不很急要。苏联怕旱，中国却怕水。（三）由于我国条件的限制，大规模的闸坝工程目前还不可能建筑，更不可能短期完成。
    布可夫同志提的意见引起了我思想上很大的震动。我动摇于两种见解之间，自己经常苦恼着：“究竟怎样才算把淮河修好呢？”以后，在实地查勘研究的过程中，布可夫同志帮助我们解决了如下问题：（一）淮河虽然源流分散，但可以而且必需建筑山谷水库，否则上游洪水问题无法解决。（二）即使在苏北这样雨水丰富的地区，为了保证农业增产，灌溉仍是必需的，布置工程时应当将除害兴利同时解决，而不应把这两个问题割裂处理。（三）在我国现有条件下，大规模闸坝工程是可能建筑而且可能在短期间完成的。
    我们的见解被逐个击破了。我开始认识到：虽然布可夫同志是苏联人，但正是他更正确地理解了毛主席的伟大号召和政务院的治淮指示。与进行第一年工程同时，我们进一步进行了大规模的勘查测量，整理分析了淮河水文资料。在治淮委员会的正确领导下，在布可夫同志的亲切帮助下，我们广大技术人员努力研究着如何在治淮规划中贯彻社会主义的水利建设方向，并拟订出了目前的气魄宏大的治淮计划草案。
    二、先进的建筑思想
    治淮工程中需要完成大规模的闸坝建筑。在国民党反动统治时代，建筑一座淮阴船闸，就算是浩大工程，需要耗费大量的木桩、钢板桩、钢筋、水泥，需要大量的技术人员，需要两年以上的时间，并向外国工厂订购闸门。而建筑洪泽湖的控制闸（国民党导淮计划中称为三河活动坝），更被称为国内绝无仅有的工程，曾经施工两年，只打下一部分基桩。治淮计划需要完成像淮阴船闸这样规模的建筑物数以百计，像三河活动坝这样规模的建筑物数处，另外更要完成坝高二十余公尺到六十余公尺的水库十余处，和大规模的灌溉输水系统、发电站、抽水站等建筑。这些工程都要求在五年内完成，每年需要完成数十个大型建筑。一般建筑物的施工时间不是几年，而是几个月。很显然，旧的建筑技术是不能满足我们的需要的。苏联专家介绍给我们一系列的先进的建筑技术，使我们顺利地克服了困难。
    水闸工程的设计，力求经济合理。布可夫同志参观淮阴船闸时，曾感叹地说：“工程师设计这样的工程，似乎以为中国的钢铁太多了！”他介绍给我们不用基桩、不用板桩等先进经验，鼓励并帮助我们用自己的工厂制造各种闸门。在和我们共同工作时，他更处处精打细算，力求节约。大量的木材、钢铁、水泥被节省下来了，建筑时间大大缩短了，并且不需向国外定货。一九五三年仅在苏北地区将完成二十五座大型水闸建筑。经苏北治淮总指挥部重行设计的新的洪泽湖控制闸，闸长七百公尺，在本年十月开工，预定在明年汛前即可全部完成。
    水库的修筑不再被认为神秘困难了。过去曾有少数工程人员认为：“要就不修，要修就修个混凝土坝。”但苏联专家提出：我们是为了蓄水而修坝，不是为修坝而修坝。土坝、堆石坝、混凝土坝、钢筋混凝土坝在一定条件下同样可以解决问题。为了节省国家资财，修坝的原则应该是：尽可能地修土坝；只有在不能修筑土坝的地方，才修混凝土坝；只有在非用钢筋不可的地方，才用钢筋。你可以用土而不用水泥修个坝，但你决不可能用土而不用水泥修个钢铁工厂；你可以用圬工不用钢筋完成个水利建筑，但你决不可能用水泥石头而不用钢铁造出拖拉机。在水库的实际建筑过程中，苏联专家布可夫和萨巴也夫同志帮助我们解决各种疑难问题。在他们的亲切帮助下，河南省治淮总指挥部的广大工程人员和行政干部都逐渐学会水库设计及施工的整套办法，并可以保证每年完成两处到三处水库工程。
    闸坝建筑工程中更重要的收获是：苏联专家帮助我们中国技术人员打开了“窍门”，大大提高了我们的民族自信心和创造热情。经苏联专家帮助我们跨过两年来技术上的各种困难后，工程师们现在有足够勇气来面对困难的工程课题了。佛子岭水库六、七十公尺高的连拱坝及许多水库的高压闸门，这些是旧中国工程人员不敢想像的复杂工作，现在已经开始在建造了。
    三、进一步学习
    两年来，我们在治淮工程中学习苏联先进经验虽有一定成绩，但还是不够的。
    “苏联技术是否先进”，这一问题曾经在很多技术人员思想中存在，因而妨碍了学习运动的展开。对一般同志来说，三年来我们国家各方面建设的实际成就，首先是两年来参加治淮工程的亲身经验，对这个问题作了有力的答复。但仍有少数同志脱离人民的实际需要，孤立地看待技术问题。他们计划一个工程，不是从全局着眼，不是研究人民的实际需要，并利用当地条件，以最经济的办法来满足这种需要，而是单纯地要求自己设计的建筑物“现代化”，设计方法“新颖高深”。他们不顾时间、地点、用途等具体条件，只是呆板地认为，钢闸门一定比木闸门进步，混凝土工程一定比土石砖工程进步，繁复的公式一定比简易的公式进步，工程用料愈讲究，它的评价也愈高。这些正是资本主义国家的“技术标准”。
    苏联专家的工作正与此相反。他们从不眩弄个人技术，只是实事求是地运用他们国家的成熟经验帮助我们解决问题。他们首先着重研究全局布置，然后再根据全局要求考虑单个工程的具体设计。他们力求利用简陋的器材设备、人民已有的技术经验来做出具有同样作用的工程。例如，我国混凝土工程的伸缩缝向例由紫铜片制作，但紫铜来源不易，价钱很贵。我们告诉布可夫同志这一情况后，他连忙在他的参考书上找出用黏土、木片、锌铁等各种材料制作伸缩缝的图样，告诉我们在苏联伸缩缝都不用紫铜片制作了。仅仅将制作伸缩缝的新方法在我国建筑工程中推广，就可为国家节省大量铜料。就苏联专家两年来帮助我们解决的各种问题看来，有人说，许多经验似乎并不包含特别高深的学理，普通工程人员都可以学会；有人说，有些问题在当时当地解决得虽很巧妙，“但毕竟属于‘因陋就简’，不足以写论文发表”；甚至有人说，某一个办法在德国书、日本书、或是美国书上也曾提到，只是过去没有注意研究采用。但正是这些，从规划原则到工程的细节指导综合起来，为我们端正了建设思想，缩短了建设时间，节省了大量资财，保证了工程的安全和效益。正是这些实际的、平凡的思想，包含了一个原则：社会主义科学技术的先进性。苏联专家帮助我们解决的大小问题，都具体显示了如何把马克思、列宁主义的立场、观点、方法运用在科学技术上。
    因此，学习苏联先进经验，对我们来说，就不仅是学习各种具体的技术方法，而应当与我们本身的思想改造相辅而行。只有彻底清除资产阶级的思想影响，确立革命的立场、观点、方法，才能很好地接受苏联的先进经验，并运用在实际工作中。同时，思想改造也必须辅以苏联先进经验的学习，才能将思想改造的成果更好地贯彻到业务工作中。
    在纪念伟大的十月革命三十五周年并展开“中苏友好月”活动的时候，让我们更进一步地展开群众性的、有系统的学习苏联先进经验的运动，来提高我们的工作水平，迎接祖国的伟大建设！
