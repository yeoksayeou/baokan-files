    I Warmly Welcome the Re-publication of "Water Margin"
    To the Editor: I warmly welcome the re-publication of "Water Margin." At the same time, I have the following thoughts.
    Our motherland has produced many great works. Whether in terms of content or artistic expression, they have achieved remarkable accomplishments. "Water Margin" is one of these many great works.
    "Water Margin" is widely circulated among the people, who love the heroic figures and the stories of their brave struggles. These figures and stories greatly inspire the people's enthusiasm for life and their will to fight. The role played by "Water Margin" among the broad masses of the people is immeasurable.
    The reactionary ruling classes throughout history deeply hated this great work. When they were unable to prohibit the circulation of the stories, they arrogantly proclaimed, "Don't read 'Water Margin' when you're young," hoping to prevent the people from loving "Water Margin." Even more shamefully, some people created works like "The Pacification of the Bandits" to slander the heroes in "Water Margin." However, the result is very clear: "Water Margin" has always been one of the people's favorite books, while "The Pacification of the Bandits" has been opposed by the people.
    However, the true value of "Water Margin," just like other great works, has never been correctly and appropriately evaluated in the past. Such an evaluation is only possible after the people have gained freedom and liberation, and the people themselves hold power. Only at this time can these great works of the people truly and completely belong to the people. The People's Literature Publishing House's reprinting of "Water Margin" this time precisely demonstrates such great significance.

### 我热烈地欢迎“水浒”重版

    我热烈地欢迎“水浒”重版
    编辑同志：我热烈地欢迎“水浒”的重版。同时我有下述感想。
    我们祖国曾经产生过许多伟大的作品。不论在内容方面及艺术表现方面，都有卓越的成就。“水浒”便是许多伟大作品当中的一个。
    “水浒”在民间极广泛地流传着，人民热爱其中的英雄人物及英勇斗争的故事。这些人物和故事大大地鼓舞了人民生活的热情及斗争的意志。“水浒”在广大人民中间所起的作用，是无法估计的。
    历来的反动统治阶级是深恶这部伟大的作品的。他们在无法禁止故事的流传时，就狂妄地宣称“少不看水浒”，想以此来阻止人民对“水浒”的喜爱，更可耻的，有人还作了像“荡寇志”一类作品，来诬蔑“水浒”中的英雄。但是，结果是很明显的：“水浒”一直是人民最喜爱的读物之一，而“荡寇志”受到了人民的反对。
    但是“水浒”真正的价值，正同其他的伟大作品一样，在过去，从未有过正确的、适如其份的评价。这样的评价，只有在人民获得自由解放，人民自己掌握政权以后，才有可能。也只有在这个时候，这些伟大的人民作品，才能真正地、完全地属于人民所有。这次人民文学出版社重印“水浒”，正表明了这样伟大的意义。察哈尔宣化女中
