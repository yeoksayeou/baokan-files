    To Build Anshan is to Build the Nation
    —On the Construction Workers and Loving Family Members Supporting Anshan Iron and Steel Company from Across the Country
    The basic construction projects of Anshan Iron and Steel Company are being carried out with the strong support of the whole country. Since April this year, 48 provinces and cities across the country have sent a large number of cadres, technicians, and workers to Anshan, and 76 enterprises have manufactured and supplied a large number of materials and equipment to Anshan. This support has ensured the smooth progress of Anshan's large-scale construction.
    According to many personnel from Anshan Iron and Steel Company who were sent to various parts of the country to recruit workers, purchase materials, and order equipment, they were warmly welcomed wherever they went, and all localities used their best efforts to support them. A comrade who went to the Hengyang Railway Bureau to recruit scaffolders said: When he went to Hengyang from Anshan, the Central-South region was vigorously carrying out the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project, and the scaffolders had been transferred to build bridges and dams; however, the responsible comrades of the Hengyang Railway Bureau still tried their best to help him complete his task. They made phone calls overnight, notifying the personnel section chiefs of Guangzhou, Guilin, and other stations to come to Hengyang for a meeting to discuss how to select the best scaffolders and send them to Anshan. From that day on, the stations enthusiastically carried out mobilization, and in less than a month, 120 scaffolders from Hengyang came to Anshan.
    The examples of Beizhen, Heishan, and Changbei counties in Liaoxi Province, Northeast China, mobilizing workers are equally touching. A section chief in Beizhen County who was responsible for mobilizing workers, was a veteran soldier with honors. When he saw the personnel from Anshan who came to recruit workers, he said happily, "During the War of Liberation, I went to Anshan, the first in all of China. Now it is going to be built, which is really exciting." Then he sent people to various districts overnight to mobilize, and in three days, 400 people were gathered. Heishan County was the battlefield where the Kuomintang bandit troops in Northeast China were completely annihilated in 1948. The people there had strongly supported the front lines. Now, when they heard that the country was going to build Anshan on a large scale, they said excitedly, "This is a major event in the construction of the country. We must support Anshan as we supported the war!" In three days, they mobilized 400 people to participate in Anshan's construction projects. After receiving the task of mobilizing workers for Anshan, Changbei County quickly mobilized more than 200 workers and temporarily paid for their travel expenses to send them to Anshan. They said, "The earlier the workers arrive, the earlier Anshan's construction will be completed, and the earlier our country's industrialization will come."
    State-owned enterprises across the country have played a significant role in supplying equipment to Anshan. They all put supporting Anshan first. Personnel who went to the Shanghai Electrical Machinery Plant to order 300,000 meters of cable said: Before they arrived at the plant, the East China Industrial Department had already notified the plant to prepare to accept Anshan's orders, and also instructed the plant to prioritize Anshan's orders. After they arrived at the plant, they quickly signed the ordering contract. In order to deliver the goods to Anshan quickly, the plant selected the best machines to specialize in producing Anshan's orders, and also transferred many excellent technical workers who had been sent to various places for training, concentrating their efforts to produce exclusively for Anshan. Recently, under the slogan of "Supporting Anshan and Welcoming the Nation's Large-Scale Economic Construction," the plant, through organizations such as the Party, the trade union, and the Communist Youth League, mobilized all workers to set plans, write guarantees, and launch a large-scale labor emulation campaign.
    In many state-owned enterprises in Northeast China, in order to vigorously support Anshan, they took the initiative to actively solve various difficulties for Anshan. For example, the No. 8 blast furnace project, which is about to be completed and put into production, encountered many difficulties in this year's construction process due to the lack of certain equipment. However, with the strong help of various state-owned enterprises, these difficulties were resolved. One of the pieces of equipment, called the "Diameter Gas Switch," was recently brought from the Benxi Coal and Iron Company's iron smelting plant. According to the personnel who handled this matter, before Anshan requested this equipment, the Benxi Iron Smelting Plant had installed this equipment on a blast furnace to be repaired several months ago; however, when the manager of Benxi Coal and Iron Company saw the letter from Anshan, he immediately ordered the iron smelting plant to dismantle the equipment and send it to Anshan.
    The Northeast Construction Industry Bureau's support for Anshan is even more active. In September this year, when Anshan Iron and Steel Company was building a heating furnace, it needed a large amount of heat-resistant cement, but our country did not have a manufacturer of this cement. Based on the suggestions of Soviet experts, the director, employees, and technicians of the Sixth Cement Plant completely undertook the supply of this material and successfully solved this task. The personnel sent by Anshan were very moved and specially thanked the plant on behalf of the workers of Anshan. The director of the plant said, "No need to thank us. We know that supporting Anshan is completely justified and the most glorious task. As long as we can do it, we should do our best."
    For example, the Anshan ○190 project needed lightweight glass, which had not been produced in our country in the past. However, when Anshan submitted an order to the Northeast Construction Industry Bureau, they treated this matter as the most important task. First, they designated the Dalian Glass Factory to conduct trial production. After the trial production was successful, they transferred all the personnel from Dalian who participated in the trial production to Shenyang for mass production at the No. 1 Utensil Factory. In order to complete this glorious and arduous task, the deputy director of the bureau personally led the work from the beginning. He often conducted research on site with the staff and said to all the personnel participating in this work: "Only when Anshan is built better can we be built better. No matter how great the difficulties are, in order to support Anshan and for the new achievements in the construction industry, we must continue to work hard." Encouraged by this noble thought, all the personnel overcame many difficulties and finally mass-produced lightweight glass.
    Anyone who has been to Anshan this year can see the strength of Anshan's transportation network: sometimes trains roar past, sometimes countless cars drive past, and hundreds and thousands of large flatbed carts, like naturally formed conveyor belts, operate back and forth day and night. This powerful transportation network transports tens of thousands of tons of materials to various places, ensuring the progress of this year's project. However, this is also inseparable from the support of various places. The chairman of the board of directors of the Sino-Soviet Railway Company personally came to Anshan to conduct inspections in order to ensure Anshan's transportation. Among the huge car fleet, half are the support team of the Dalian City Transportation Company. Among the thousands of large flatbed carts, there are support teams from Yingkou, Liaoyang, and Shenyang. The members of the automobile support team of the Dalian City Transportation Company were in high spirits. As soon as they arrived in Anshan, they created new records in transportation and promoted the entire Anshan transportation work, setting off a heated competition. They all said, "In the past, it was recovery, now it is construction. Our country is getting stronger and stronger. How can we not be energetic?"
    People are proud to have done even a little thing for Anshan in order to express their wishes to support Anshan. In the summer of this year, such a thing happened: Liaodong Province in Northeast China specially transferred nearly 200 members of the Communist Youth League from various counties and cities to support Anshan. When they were concentrated in Liaoyang City, they encountered the difficulty of having many people but few rooms. It happened that most of the students of the Liaodong Provincial Normal School in the city had gone to Qian Mountain for travel. When the students left at the school heard that they were going to support Anshan, they quickly cleaned the rooms to accommodate them and also lent them the students' "bedding," expressing to them: "You are all people who support Anshan. We welcome you, which also expresses our students' wish to support Anshan!"
    Looking at these exciting scenes, we cannot help but feel proud of the superiority of our great motherland's social system and the unity of the people, and we are inspired by the bright future of our great motherland, because this heartwarming support from all the people not only enables Anshan's large-scale basic construction this year to proceed smoothly, but also is a huge force and victory guarantee for building our country's industry.

    为鞍山就是为全国
    ——记全国支援鞍山钢铁公司的建设常工、爱芝
    鞍山钢铁公司的基本建设工程，是在全国大力支援下进行的。从今年四月间起，全国有四十八个省、市为鞍山输送了大批的干部、技术人员和工人，七十六个企业单位为鞍山制造和供应了大批的器材与设备，这些支援保证了鞍山的大规模建设得以顺利的前进。
    据鞍山钢铁公司派至全国各地招领工人、采购物资与制订设备的许多人员谈，他们每到一地，都受到热烈的欢迎，各地都用最大的力量，来支援他们。一个前往衡阳铁路局招领架工的同志说：当他从鞍山前往衡阳的时候，中南地区正在轰轰烈烈地进行荆江分洪工程，架工都被调去修桥修闸了；但是衡阳铁路局的负责同志，仍想尽办法帮助他完成任务。他们连夜打电话，通知广州、桂林等车站的人事科长到衡阳开会，商议如何把最好的架工抽出来，送给鞍山。从这天以后，各站热烈地进行动员，不到一个月的时间，衡阳的一百二十名架工就来到鞍山了。
    东北辽西省北镇、黑山和昌北三县动员工人的例子，也是同样的动人。北镇县负责动员工人的一个科长，是个荣誉军人，当他看到鞍山前去招领工人的人员的时候，很高兴地说：“在解放战争中，我到过鞍山，全中国第一个，现在要建设它，真是叫人高兴。”接着他就连夜派人到各区去动员，三天的时间，集中了四百人。黑山县是一九四八年全歼东北蒋匪军的战场，那里的人民曾大力地支援过前线，现在听说国家要大规模建设鞍山，他们都兴奋地说：“这是建设国家的大事情，咱们一定要像支援战争那样地支援鞍山！”三天的时间，就动员了四百个人去参加鞍山建筑工程。昌北县接到为鞍山动员工人的任务之后，很快地动员了二百多个工人，并且暂垫路费把工人送到鞍山。他们说：“工人早到一天，鞍山建设也就早完成一天，我们国家工业化也就早来到一天。”
    全国各地的国营企业，在供应鞍山的设备工作方面，起了很大作用。他们都把支援鞍山放在第一位。曾到上海电机厂订制三十万公尺电缆线的人员说：他们未到该厂以前，华东工业部就已通知该厂准备接受鞍山的订货，并且还对该厂指示：要把鞍山的订货放在第一位。当他们到达该厂以后，很快就签订了订货合同，该厂为了向鞍山迅速地交货，把最好的机器抽出来专门制做鞍山订货，还把许多送到各处学习的优秀的技术工人调回来，集中力量专门为鞍山生产。最近该厂更在“支援鞍山，迎接全国大规模的经济建设”的口号下，通过党、工会、青年团等组织，发动全厂工人订计划，写保证书，展开了大规模的劳动竞赛运动。
    在东北许多国营企业中，为了大力支援鞍山，主动地积极地为鞍山解决各种困难。例如即将完工开始生产的八号高炉工程，在今年的修建过程中，曾因缺乏某些设备，遇到了许多困难，但在各国营企业的大力帮助下，这些困难都得到了解决。其中有一项设备叫做“直径瓦斯开关器”，是最近才从本溪煤铁公司炼铁厂拉来的。据经手这件事的人员说，在鞍山未要这个设备以前，本溪炼铁厂在几个月以前，就把这个设备安装在待修的高炉上了；但当本溪煤铁公司经理看到鞍山的去信以后，立刻就叫炼铁厂把这个设备拆下来送给鞍山。
    东北建筑工业局对鞍山的支援，更是积极。今年九月间，鞍山钢铁公司修建一座加热炉时，需要大量的耐热水泥，而我国却没有这种水泥的制造厂。根据苏联专家的建议，第六水泥厂的厂长、职工和技术人员完全承担了这一项材料的供应，并完满地解决了这一任务。鞍山派去的人很为感动，特地代表鞍山工人向该厂致谢。该厂厂长说：“不用谢了，我们知道支援鞍山是完全应该的事，也是最光荣的任务，只要我们能办到，我们应当尽力的。”
    又如鞍山○一九○工程需要轻量玻璃，这种玻璃在我国过去没有制过，但当鞍山向东北建筑工业局提出订货以后，他们把这事当作一件最重要的任务，首先指定大连玻璃厂进行试制，试制成功以后，又把大连参加试制的全部人员调到沈阳，在第一器皿厂大量生产。为了完成这一光荣、艰巨的任务，一开始就由该局副局长亲自领导这一工作，他经常在现场与工作人员进行研究，向参加这一工作的全体人员说：“只有鞍山建设得更好，咱们才会建设得更好，不管困难多大，为了支援鞍山，为了建筑工业上的新成就，咱们一定要干下去。”全体人员在这一崇高思想的鼓舞下，克服了重重的困难，终于大量生产轻量玻璃了。
    凡是今年到过鞍山的人们，都可以看到鞍山的运输网的强大：一回儿火车吼叫着开过来，一回儿又是无数的汽车开过去，而成百上千的大板车，更像自然结成的传送带一样，日日夜夜地来回运转着。这个强大的运输网，将成千上万吨物资，运送到各处，保证了今年工程的进度。但是，这也是与各地的支援分不开的。中长铁路公司理事会主席为了保证鞍山的运输，曾亲自来鞍山进行检查。在巨大的汽车群中，有一半是旅大市搬运公司的支援大队。数千辆大板车中，有营口、辽阳与沈阳等地的支援大队。旅大市搬运公司的汽车支援大队队员们的情绪极高，一到鞍山，就在运输上创造了新纪录，并推动了整个鞍山的运输工作，掀起热烈的竞赛。他们都这样说：“过去是恢复，现在是建设，我们国家越来越强大了，我们怎能不起劲？”
    人们为了表示支援鞍山的心愿，那怕只为鞍山作了一点点事情也都引以为荣。在今年的夏天，就曾发生了这样的一件事情：东北辽东省为了支援鞍山，特地从各县、市抽调出近二百名青年团员，当他们在辽阳市集中的时候，却遇到了人多房少的困难。恰好该市辽东省立师范学校的大部分同学都到千山去旅行了，该校留校的同学听说他们是前去支援鞍山的，很快地把房子打扫出来招待他们住宿，并且还把同学的“铺盖”借给他们，向他们表示：“你们都是支援鞍山的人，我们欢迎你们，也就是表示我们同学支援鞍山的心愿啊！”
    看看这些令人兴奋的情景，我们就不禁为我们伟大祖国社会制度的优越性和人民的团结而感到骄傲，为我们伟大祖国光明的前程而感到振奋，因为这种万众一心令人鼓舞的支援，不仅使得鞍山今年的大规模的基本建设得以顺利前进，而且也是建设我国工业的巨大力量和胜利保障。
