Xinhua News Agency, New York, 16th: The United Nations General Assembly Trusteeship Council has concluded its discussion on the issue of reports regarding non-self-governing territories. The committee also discussed the future work of the special committee established by the United Nations General Assembly in 1949 to review reports on the situation in non-self-governing territories submitted by the administering authorities. A question arose regarding the participation of representatives from non-self-governing territories in the work of this committee.

The colonial powers suffered serious defeats on all these issues.

Despite the opposition of the colonial powers, the Trusteeship Council passed a resolution recommending that all administering authorities abolish or amend all laws and regulations that impose racial, religious, or other forms of discrimination against the indigenous people of the colonies. Delegations from forty-six countries, including the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, Byelorussia, Ukraine, and Poland, voted in favor of this resolution. Representatives from several colonial powers, including the United States and the United Kingdom, did not dare to openly vote against it. The US representative proposed a reservation stating that the resolution should not tend to interfere with the relationship between the administering authorities and the non-self-governing territories. This reservation actually meant that the United States refused to implement the resolution. The French representative abstained, and the representatives of Belgium and the Union of South Africa did not participate in the vote.

The colonial powers also suffered a defeat in the discussion of extending the term of the United Nations Special Committee for the Review of Reports on Non-Self-Governing Territories. Representatives from the United Kingdom, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and some other colonial powers tried their best to abolish this committee. Soviet representative Yulans exposed the attempts of the colonial countries and expressed support for extending the term of the special committee. The Trusteeship Council passed a proposal to extend the term of the special committee for reviewing reports on the situation in non-self-governing territories for three years. The proposal stipulated that the committee could automatically extend its term in the future unless the United Nations decides otherwise. Delegations from forty countries, including the Soviet Union, Ukraine, Byelorussia, Czechoslovakia, Poland, the Philippines, Venezuela, Afghanistan, Egypt, Iran, Iraq, and Lebanon, voted in favor of this proposal. Representatives from twelve countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom, and France, voted against it.

At the same time, the Trusteeship Council passed a joint proposal submitted by Burma, India, Indonesia, and Pakistan, stating that representatives from non-self-governing territories should participate in the work of the special committee reviewing reports on the situation in these territories. Soviet representative Yulans emphasized that the colonial powers' opposition to the participation of representatives of indigenous people in the work of the committee once again showed world opinion that they were afraid of the participation of representatives from non-self-governing territories in the committee because these representatives would expose their policies of plundering the colonies.

As a result of the vote, the proposal on the participation of representatives from non-self-governing territories in the work of the committee was passed by an overwhelming majority. Delegations from forty countries, including the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, Byelorussia, Ukraine, Poland, Pakistan, Burma, India, Lebanon, and Iraq, voted in favor of this proposal. Representatives from ten countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom, and France, voted against it.

    联大托管委员会结束关于非自治地区情况报告问题的讨论
    建议殖民国家取消种族和宗教等歧视法律
    美英法等少数殖民国家在委员会会议上遭到严重失败
    【新华社十六日讯】塔斯社纽约讯：联合国大会托管委员会已将关于非自治地区情况报告的问题讨论完毕。委员会也讨论了联合国大会在一九四九年为审议各管理当局提出的非自治地区情况报告而设立的专门委员会的今后工作问题。在这一点上发生了一个问题，就是非自治地区代表参加这个委员会的工作问题。
    殖民国家在所有这些问题上遭到了严重的失败。
    托管委员会不顾殖民国家的反对通过了一项决议。建议各管理当局取消或修改一切对殖民地土著人民实行种族、宗教和其他歧视的法律和条例。包括苏联、捷克斯洛伐克、白俄罗斯、乌克兰和波兰等国在内的四十六个国家的代表团，投票赞成这个决议。包括美国和英国在内的几个殖民国家的代表不敢公开投票反对。美国代表提出一项保留意见，就是这个决议不可倾向于干涉管理当局与非自治地区之间的关系。这一保留意见实际上就是意味着美国拒绝实行这个决议。法国代表弃权，比利时和南非联邦代表没有参加投票。
    在讨论延长联合国审议非自治地区情况报告专门委员会的期限问题时，殖民国家也遭到了失败。英国、法国、比利时、荷兰和一些别的殖民国家的代表们竭力想取消这个委员会。苏联代表尤兰斯揭露了殖民国家的企图并且表示赞成延长专门委员会的期限。托管委员会通过了把审议非自治地区情况报告的专门委员会的期限延长三年的提案。提案中规定这个委员会将来也可自动延长期限，除非联合国另有决定。包括苏联、乌克兰、白俄罗斯、捷克斯洛伐克、波兰、菲律宾、委内瑞拉、阿富汗、埃及、伊朗、伊拉克和黎巴嫩等国在内的四十个国家的代表团投票赞成这个提案。美、英、法等十二个国家的代表投票反对。
    托管委员会同时通过了缅甸、印度、印尼和巴基斯坦联名提出的关于非自治地区代表应参加审议这些地区情况报告的专门委员会的工作的提案。苏联代表尤兰斯着重指出：殖民国家反对土著人民代表参加委员会的工作，再次向世界舆论表明了它们害怕非自治地区代表参加委员会，因为这些代表会暴露它们掠夺殖民地的政策。
    投票结果，关于非自治地区代表应参加委员会工作的提案以绝大多数票获得通过。包括苏联、捷克斯洛伐克、白俄罗斯、乌克兰、波兰、巴基斯坦、缅甸、印度、黎巴嫩和伊拉克等国在内的四十个国家的代表团投票赞成这个提案。美、英、法等十个国家代表投票反对。
