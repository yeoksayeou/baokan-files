　　National Cooperatives Exceed Purchase Plan for Cotton in September and October
　　Some Regions Should Strengthen Cotton Processing, Grading, Transportation, and Material Supply

    Cooperatives in major cotton-producing areas across the country have exceeded the cotton purchase plan for September and October. From September to October 20th, the amount of ginned cotton purchased by cooperatives in cotton-producing areas nationwide reached 100.3% of the planned amount for September and October. Ginned cotton already delivered to the state-owned China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Corporation accounts for 68.3% of the cotton purchase plan for September and October.

    In order to eliminate congestion during cotton sales by cotton farmers, cooperatives in various regions have vigorously organized collective cotton sales. The Xiangcaiying Village Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Linzhang County, Hebei Province, in conjunction with the local Party and government organizations, encouraged cotton farmers to inform the purchasing station of their cotton sales figures and times in advance, in order to organize and orderly purchase cotton. The Maoyijian Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Anyang County, Pingyuan Province, mobilized 160 cotton farmers from 35 mutual aid groups in five villages to collectively sell more than 39,000 jin of cotton, saving cotton farmers 301 labor days and increasing the cooperative's work efficiency by 1.4 times.

    Cooperatives in various regions generally paid attention to the grading of cotton during cotton purchases and appropriately controlled cotton prices, but individual regions still did not pay enough attention to this, resulting in chaotic grading and failure to effectively implement the price policy of "better cotton, better price; lower cotton, lower price."

    Since October, cooperatives in various regions have increased their cotton processing capacity; however, some regions have not fully organized the masses for processing, nor have they fully utilized their own processing potential, resulting in the accumulation of a large amount of seed cotton. For example, in Hebei Province, only about 80% of the total ginning capacity is utilized, with 39,526 manual cotton gins and 2,724 powered cotton gins in operation. This is because the cooperatives in the province have not fully organized the processing power of the masses, resulting in the accumulation of approximately 100 million jin of seed cotton. As of October 20th, the amount of cotton delivered by cooperatives in cotton-producing areas nationwide to the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Corporation accounted for only 68.3% of the purchased amount, indicating that cooperatives in various regions have a considerable amount of backlog in processing and accumulating seed cotton. Although some regions have paid attention to cotton processing, they have not fully organized transportation, so processed cotton cannot be delivered to the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Corporation in a timely manner. Insufficient supplies of grain and other materials in individual regions have also greatly affected the completion of cotton purchase tasks. The imbalance in material supply in Jianyang area of Sichuan Province has already caused local price increases. In the Guanzhong cotton-producing area of Shaanxi, there is a shortage of grain in Dali and other places, and cotton farmers rush to buy grain after selling cotton. The shortcomings in the above work should be vigorously overcome by the relevant cooperatives.

    全国合作社超额完成九、十月份购棉计划
    有些地区应加强棉花加工、验级、运输和物资供应工作
    全国各主要产棉区的合作社已超额完成九、十月份购棉计划。自九月至十月二十日，全国各产棉区合作社收购皮棉数量，已达九、十两月份计划数的百分之一零零点三；已经交给国营中国花纱布公司的皮棉，占九、十月份购棉计划数的百分之六十八点三。
    各地合作社为消除棉农售棉时的拥挤现象，大力组织棉农集体售棉。河北省临漳县香采营村供销合作社收棉站和当地党政机关相结合，发动棉农提前把售棉数字、时间告诉收购站，以便有组织有秩序地收购棉花。平原省安阳县毛仪涧供销合作社发动了五个村三十五个互助组的一百六十户棉农，集体售棉三万九千多斤，为棉农节省劳动力三百零一个，同时也使合作社工作效率提高一点四倍。
    各地合作社在收购棉花的时候，一般地都很重视棉花的分级工作，并且适当地掌握了棉花的价格，但个别地区对此仍重视不足，以致分级混乱，不能切实贯彻“优棉优价、低棉低价”的价格政策。
    各地合作社自十月份以来，都增强了棉花加工力量；但有的地区没有充分组织群众加工，也没有充分发挥本身的加工潜在能力，使大批籽棉积压下来。例如，河北省已开动的人力轧花机三万九千五百二十六台，动力轧花机二千七百二十四台，只达全部轧花力的百分之八十左右。这是因为该省合作社没有充分组织群众的加工力量，以致积压了一亿斤左右的籽棉。截至十月二十日止，全国产棉区合作社送交花纱布公司的棉花数量仅占收购量的百分之六十八点三，这说明各地合作社加工不力、积压的籽棉是相当多的。有的地区虽然重视了棉花加工工作，但未充分组织运输力量，使得加工过的棉花不能及时交给花纱布公司。个别地区由于粮食和其他物资供应不足，也大大影响了棉花收购任务的完成。四川省简阳地区因物资供应失调，已引起当地物价上涨。陕西关中产棉区的大荔等地缺粮，棉农售棉后都去抢购。上述工作中的缺点，有关的合作社应即大力克服。
