Xinhua News Agency, November 28th:

    Statement by Zhou Enlai, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, endorsing the Soviet delegation's proposal to the Seventh Session of the United Nations General Assembly regarding the Korean question. The text is as follows:

    On November 24, 1952, Soviet Foreign Minister Vyshinsky, representing the Soviet delegation to the Seventh Session of the United Nations General Assembly, submitted a supplementary proposal to the General Assembly regarding the Soviet delegation's November 10 proposal on the Korean question. The Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China believes that the Soviet delegation's November 10 proposal and November 24 supplementary proposal are the only reasonable way to immediately end the Korean War and peacefully resolve the Korean question. Therefore, I am authorized to express full support for the Soviet delegation's proposal.

    Sixteen months have passed since the Korean armistice talks began on July 10, 1951. Throughout the entire negotiation process, the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, in order to satisfy the urgent desire of the people of the world for a Korean armistice, have consistently and firmly maintained the dignity of international conventions and international practices, strictly adhered to humanitarian principles, and persistently adopted a negotiating and reasonable attitude, constantly making great efforts to reach a armistice agreement quickly on a fair and reasonable basis. On the other hand, the United States, in order to maintain international tensions and extract huge profits from this unjust war of aggression, has been unreasonable from the beginning, arbitrarily tearing up international conventions, wantonly undermining humanitarian principles, frequently and constantly refusing to negotiate, and finally unilaterally declared an indefinite adjournment, attempting to undermine the armistice talks and prolong and expand the war. Due to this delaying and destructive policy of the United States, the armistice talks have been going on for sixteen months without being successfully completed; however, thanks to the great patience and firm efforts of the Korean and Chinese sides, the draft Korean Armistice Agreement has been agreed upon, with only the issue of prisoner repatriation remaining. It is precisely this issue of prisoner repatriation that has not been reasonably resolved to date due to the US side's deliberate insistence on its criminal claim to detain Korean and Chinese prisoners of war.

    The US government's policy on the issue of prisoner repatriation since the beginning of negotiations on prisoner of war issues on December 11, 1951, namely the principles of "voluntary repatriation" and "non-forcible repatriation" put forward by them at Panmunjom, and the principle of "non-forcible repatriation" recently put forward at the Seventh Session of the United Nations General Assembly, are actually all just a change of name with the forcible detention of prisoners of war as their basic content. In order to achieve this goal of forcibly detaining prisoners of war, the US aggressor troops have long used a large number of Syngman Rhee and Chiang Kai-shek special agents among the captured Korean and Chinese personnel, using beatings, tattooing, stamping with blood, mass shootings and hangings to coerce prisoners of war, attempting to make them violate their own will and acknowledge opposition to their motherland and "refuse repatriation". It must be pointed out that this act of coercing prisoners of war with force is a complete violation of international law and humanitarian principles. According to the provisions of the 1949 Geneva Convention, after the armistice takes effect, both belligerent parties have the absolute responsibility to promptly release and repatriate all prisoners of war and hand them over to the other party, and have no right to use force or special agents to forcibly detain prisoners of war.

    The US government's absurd and outrageous claims regarding the issue of prisoner of war repatriation, and its despicable and brutal acts of mistreating prisoners of war, not only fundamentally violate Article 51 of the draft Korean Armistice Agreement regarding the prompt release and repatriation of all prisoners of war by both sides after the armistice and the desire of prisoners of war on both sides to return home and live a peaceful life as soon as possible, not only completely destroy the provisions of the 1949 Geneva Convention and all the principles of international law and international practice regarding the treatment of prisoners of war, but also intentionally turn a prisoner of war repatriation issue that should not have become a problem into the only obstacle hindering the realization of a Korean armistice, seriously threatening peace in the Far East and the world. This is intolerable to the people of Korea and China, and it is intolerable to the people of the world. The US government must bear full responsibility for this serious international tension caused by the failure to achieve a Korean armistice.

    The Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China believes that the early end of the Korean War is closely related to the interests of peace in Asia and the world, and closely related to the interests of the people of all countries, especially those who have their sons shedding blood on the Korean front. Therefore, in order to realize the urgent desire for peace of the people of the world, in order to express the sincerity of the Chinese people in eagerly hoping for the early restoration of peace in Korea, and to prevent the issue of prisoner repatriation from becoming an obstacle and excuse for realizing a Korean armistice, we hereby express our full support for the comprehensive proposal put forward by the Soviet delegation to first achieve an armistice in Korea and then resolve the issue of full repatriation of prisoners of war, that is, the warring parties in Korea should immediately and completely cease fire in accordance with the draft armistice agreement already agreed upon by both parties, that is, both parties should cease all land, sea, and air military operations, and the issue of full repatriation of prisoners of war should be handed over to the "Committee for the Peaceful Settlement of the Korean Question" stipulated in the Soviet proposal composed of the United States, the United Kingdom, France, the Soviet Union, the People's Republic China, India, Burma, Switzerland, Czechoslovakia, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and South Korea; this committee should immediately take measures to resolve the Korean question in the spirit of unification of Korea by the Koreans themselves under the supervision of this committee; in this committee, all issues should be decided by a two-thirds majority vote of all members. The Central People's Government believes that this proposal can pave the way for a peaceful settlement of the Korean question.

    At the same time, the Central People's Government believes that it should be stated that after the warring parties achieve a complete ceasefire, the issue of full repatriation of prisoners of war must still be resolved in accordance with the principles of the Geneva Convention and international practice in dealing with prisoners of war. This is an unshakeable principle. Any proposal regarding the settlement of the Korean prisoner of war issue that shakes these principles is unreasonable and inhumane, and therefore unacceptable.

    周恩来外长发表声明
    赞同苏联关于朝鲜问题的建议
    【新华社二十八日讯】中华人民共和国中央人民政府外交部部长周恩来关于赞同苏联代表团向联合国第七届大会提出的关于朝鲜问题的建议的声明。文如下：
    一九五二年十一月二十四日，苏联维辛斯基外长代表出席联合国第七届大会的苏联代表团，向大会提出了对于苏联代表团在十一月十日关于朝鲜问题提案的补充建议。中华人民共和国中央人民政府认为苏联代表团十一月十日的提案及十一月二十四日的补充建议是立即结束朝鲜战争并和平解决朝鲜问题的唯一合理途径，因此，特授权本人对于苏联代表团的提案表示完全赞同。
    自从一九五一年七月十日开始举行朝鲜停战谈判以来，十六个月已经过去了。在整个谈判过程中，朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军方面为了满足全世界人民对于朝鲜停战的迫切要求，自始至终坚决维护国际公约和国际惯例的尊严，严格遵守人道的原则，坚持协商说理的态度，不断作了巨大的努力，以求在公平合理的基础上迅速达成停战协议；而美国方面，为了保持国际紧张局势，以便从这场非正义的侵略战争中攫取巨额利润，一开始就蛮不讲理，任意撕毁国际公约，肆无忌惮地破坏人道原则，经常不断地拒绝协商，最后竟至片面宣告无限期休会，企图依靠这一切来破坏停战谈判，延长和扩大战争。由于美国这种拖延和破坏政策，停战谈判进行了十六个月之久还不能顺利完成；可是，由于朝中方面的极大耐心和坚定努力，朝鲜停战协定草案已经得到了协议，所剩下的只是一个遣俘问题。也正是这一个遣俘问题，由于美方故意坚持其扣留朝中战俘的罪恶主张，迄今不能得到合理的解决。
    美国政府自一九五一年十二月十一日开始谈判战俘问题以迄于今所持的政策，即他们在板门店提出的“自愿遣返”原则和“不强迫遣返”原则，以及最近在联合国第七届大会上提出的“不以武力遣返”原则，实际上都是换汤不换药地以强迫扣留战俘为其基本内容的。为了达到这个强迫扣留战俘的目的，美国侵略军多时以来就在朝中被俘人员当中使用了大批李承晚、蒋介石特务，以毒打、刺字、盖血印、集体枪杀和绞刑等来胁迫战俘，企图使他们违背自己意志而承认反对自己的祖国并“拒绝遣返”。必须指出，这种以武力胁迫战俘的行为是完全违背国际公法和人道原则的。依照一九四九年日内瓦公约的规定，交战双方在停战生效后，有绝对责任迅速释放与遣返全部战俘，把他们交给对方，而没有任何权利使用武力和特务，来强迫扣留战俘。
    美国政府对于战俘遣返问题的荒谬绝伦的主张，和虐待战俘的卑劣残暴的行为，不仅根本违反了朝鲜停战协定草案第五十一款关于双方全部战俘在停战后须尽速予以释放和遣返的规定和交战双方战俘得以早日回家过和平生活的愿望，不仅彻底破坏了一九四九年日内瓦公约的规定及一切关于战俘待遇的国际公法和国际惯例的原则，而且还有意地把一个原本不应该成为问题的战俘遣返问题变成了阻挠朝鲜停战实现的唯一障碍，使远东与世界和平受到严重的威胁。这是朝中两国人民所不能容忍的，也是全世界人民所不能容忍的。美国政府对于朝鲜停战不能实现所造成的这种严重的国际紧张局势，必须负全部责任。
    中华人民共和国中央人民政府认为，朝鲜战争的早日结束密切地关联到亚洲与全世界和平的利益，密切地关联到各国人民，首先是那些有自己的子弟在朝鲜前线流血的各国人民的利益。因此，为了实现全世界人民迫切的和平愿望，为了表示中国人民切盼朝鲜和平早日恢复的诚意，而不使遣俘问题再成为实现朝鲜停战的障碍和藉口，我们兹特表示完全赞同苏联代表团所提的先在朝鲜停战，然后解决战俘全部遣返问题的全盘建议，亦即是在朝鲜的交战双方按照双方已经同意的停战协定草案，立即完全停火，就是说双方停止一切陆、海、空军事行动，战俘全部遣返问题则交给苏联提案中所规定的由美国、英国、法国、苏联、中华人民共和国、印度、缅甸、瑞士、捷克斯洛伐克、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和南朝鲜组成的“和平解决朝鲜问题委员会”去解决；这个委员会并应本着由朝鲜人自己在这个委员会监督下统一朝鲜的精神，立即采取解决朝鲜问题的措施；在这个委员会中，一切问题要经全体成员三分之二多数赞成决定的全盘建议。中央人民政府相信，这个建议是能够替和平解决朝鲜问题开辟道路的。
    同时，中央人民政府认为应当声明，在交战双方实现完全停火后，战俘全部遣返问题仍必须依照日内瓦公约的原则和国际处理战俘的惯例来解决。这是不可动摇的原则。任何关于解决朝鲜战俘问题的建议如果动摇了这些原则，那就都是不合理的和违反人道的，因而都是不能接受的。
        一九五二年十一月二十八日
