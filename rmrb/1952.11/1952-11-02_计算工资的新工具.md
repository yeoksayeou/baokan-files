    New Tool for Calculating Wages
    Comrade Editor: The production accounting team of the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant's repair shop has created a "wage converter" which improves work efficiency three times more than using an abacus and one time more than using a computer. After the plant implemented the eight-grade wage system, the calculation procedures became complicated: first calculate workdays, then convert workdays into wage points according to different grades, and then convert wage points into wage amounts according to the monthly point value. The team was constantly busy because wages were paid twice a month, and errors sometimes occurred. During the movement to find shortcuts, comrades Zhang Liangshan, Wang Zhentang, and Li Kaiying researched and developed the "wage converter." Using it to calculate wages, 180 people can be calculated per hour, and errors are guaranteed to be avoided. This overcomes the phenomenon of having to work overtime to calculate wages for many years, and also overcomes the difficulty of "not being able to calculate wages without knowing how to use an abacus."
    The "wage converter" is simple in construction, easy to use, and costs only 150,000 yuan to manufacture, which is equal to 1.33% of the cost of a computer.    Hua Zhipeng

    计算工资的新工具
    编辑同志：太原钢铁厂修造部生产核算组职员，创造了“工资换算器”，较用算盘计算提高工作效率三倍，较用计算机提高工作效率一倍。该厂实行八级工资制后，计算手续复杂：先算工日，再按不同等级把工日折成工资分，又按当月分值把工资分折成工资额。每月发工资两次，该组都忙个不停，有时还发生错误。在找窍门运动中，张良善、王侦堂、李开应等同志，研究出“工资换算器”。用它计算工资，每小时能计算一百八十人，并保证不出错误。这就克服了多年来的算工资必须加班的现象，也克服了“不会打算盘不能算工资”的困难。
    “工资换算器”构造简单，使用方便，制造成本只十五万元。等于一架计算机百分之一点三三的费用。    华志鹏
