    Endorse Foreign Minister Zhou's Statement
    On November 28th, Zhou Enlai, Minister of Foreign Affairs of our country, issued a statement endorsing the proposal by Vyshinsky, head of the Soviet delegation to the United Nations General Assembly, on November 10th regarding a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, and the supplementary proposal of November 24th: The opposing sides in Korea should immediately and completely cease fire in accordance with the draft armistice agreement already agreed upon by both sides, that is, both sides should cease all land, sea, and air military actions, and the issue of complete repatriation of prisoners of war should be handed over to the "Committee for the Peaceful Resolution of the Korean Issue" stipulated in the Soviet proposal, composed of the United States, Britain, France, the USSR, the People's Republic of China, India, Burma, Switzerland, Czechoslovakia, the People's Democratic Republic of Korea, and South Korea; this committee should immediately take measures to resolve the Korean issue in the spirit of unification of Korea by the Koreans themselves under the supervision of this committee; in this committee, all issues should be decided by a two-thirds majority of all members. The entire Chinese people express complete endorsement and support for this proposal by Vyshinsky, head of the Soviet delegation, and the statement by our Foreign Minister Zhou.
    The Korean issue has been discussed at the United Nations General Assembly for more than a month. People all over the world have seen that in this month-long discussion, the Soviet Union has from the outset taken a stand of seeking peaceful unification of Korea, and has repeatedly proposed the establishment of a committee for the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue to resolve issues related to peaceful unification of Korea and the repatriation of prisoners of war in the Korean armistice. The Soviet Union's supplementary proposal of November 24th is especially the only way to satisfy the ardent desire of peace-loving people around the world for a Korean armistice. The United States, on the other hand, has from the outset pressured the United Nations General Assembly to support the US's so-called "non-forcible repatriation" claim of forcibly detaining prisoners of war, and used various pressures to mobilize countries in the United Nations General Assembly to help the United States further expand its war of aggression. From Acheson's speeches at the United Nations General Assembly to the various remarks made by US military and political officials during this period demanding that other countries spend more money and effort to launch a so-called major offensive in Korea, people can see very clearly that the United States wants to turn the Seventh General Assembly of the United Nations into a tool for the United States to expand its war of aggression. However, due to the Soviet Union's strong struggle, advocating peace, and due to the urgent demands of people all over the world, including the American people, for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, the United States' wishful thinking is encountering a not-so-satisfactory situation in the United Nations. No matter how stubbornly they insist on obstructing the realization of a Korean armistice with the so-called "non-forcible repatriation," which in reality is the forcible detention of prisoners of war, this will only further increase the difficulties and failures of their war of aggression.
    The entire development of the Korean armistice negotiations illustrates the following fact: that the United States has consistently put forward unreasonable demands to delay the negotiations. Especially on the issue of prisoner repatriation, the United States has insisted on the so-called "voluntary repatriation" claim of detaining prisoners of war, without making the slightest concession. Whenever the negotiations approached a resolution, the United States would create extraneous obstacles and come up with new tricks to make the issue encounter new difficulties and prevent it from being resolved. On October 8th, the US side, disregarding the reasonable proposals put forward by our side, unilaterally announced an indefinite adjournment, suspending the negotiations. For more than sixteen months, it was only because our side insisted on a fair and reasonable position that an agreement was reached on sixty-three clauses of the draft armistice agreement. On the issue of prisoner of war repatriation, our side, in accordance with the Geneva Convention, advocated the unconditional repatriation of all prisoners of war, and in terms of specific methods, in order to achieve the armistice that the people unanimously demanded as soon as possible, and in order to allow the millions of prisoners of war to return home and reunite with their beloved families as soon as possible, we have repeatedly put forward reasonable compromise plans. On October 16th, Generals Kim Il-sung and Peng Dehuai sent a letter to Clark, once again proposing our side's suggestion to adopt the US side's opinion on resolving the repatriation issue, but the US side continued to reject it, insisting on refusing to resume negotiations. From this, it can be seen that we have consistently strived to resolve the issue of prisoner repatriation in order to achieve an armistice, while the United States has always refused to resolve this issue in order to prolong and expand the war.
    Recently, in the United Nations General Assembly, due to pressure from the United States, some countries in the United Nations General Assembly, disregarding the United States's brutal destruction of international conventions and its attempt to use the prisoner repatriation issue to completely break down negotiations and expand the war, blindly hoped that by sacrificing the solemn provisions of international conventions regarding the unconditional repatriation of prisoners of war, they could accommodate the United States's so-called "non-forcible repatriation," "voluntary repatriation," or "non-repatriation by force," which in reality is the forcible detention of prisoners of war. Proposals generated under US pressure that include such intentions are, in fact, based on the US's "voluntary repatriation," "non-forcible repatriation," or "non-repatriation by force" as the principles for their implementation, and the result is the US's "voluntary repatriation."
    The US's so-called "voluntary repatriation," "non-forcible repatriation," or "non-repatriation by force" fundamentally violates the Geneva Convention and the draft armistice agreement. Because prisoners of war are combatants of the opposing side who have been captured and controlled by the enemy by force. During their detention, they are in a state of being forced and are not free. For them, the freest state and the most humane treatment is to lift the armed control over them after the armistice and repatriate them home to restore their freedom. Precisely because of this, the Geneva Convention not only stipulates that prisoners of war must be immediately and unconditionally repatriated in full after the end of the war, but also stipulates that prisoners of war shall not, under any circumstances, waive their right to be repatriated home, in order to prevent any possibility of using so-called "non-forcible repatriation" to forcibly detain prisoners of war. The draft armistice agreement agreed upon by the opposing sides in Korea in accordance with the spirit of the Geneva Convention also stipulates that after the armistice agreement comes into effect, both sides shall promptly release and repatriate all prisoners of war. The US government clearly knows these provisions, and also knows that its claim is undermining international conventions. However, in order to insist on detaining prisoners of war in order to expand the war, they are so barbarous as to openly advocate not complying with these international conventions. For example, Mrs. Roosevelt, a member of the US delegation to the United Nations General Assembly, openly stated in the "New York World-Telegram and Sun" that the United States cannot too thoroughly comply with various international conventions. We know that before the Second World War, it was precisely because some countries in the world condoned Hitler's arbitrary tearing up of international treaties that mankind suffered that terrible disaster. This is a lesson that people should deeply remember.
    In fact, the US's so-called "non-forcible repatriation" is even more of a tool deliberately fabricated to detain prisoners of war. The bloody facts in US prisoner of war camps are: the United States uses a large number of Chiang Kai-shek and Syngman Rhee's agents to conduct illegal so-called "screening" of prisoners of war through abuse, torture, forced fingerprinting, and forced tattooing, coercing and forcing prisoners of war to accept insulting marks against their patriotic feelings with seductive questions. Despite this, our captured personnel resolutely resisted these atrocities by the United States, sacrificing many lives as a result. This has been clearly acknowledged by many individuals and groups on the US side. Now, the United States insists that captured personnel on the Korean-Chinese side do not want to go home, and therefore it wants to "not forcibly repatriate." What principle does this illustrate? Doesn't this show that the United States wants to legalize its illegal act of forcibly screening and detaining prisoners of war with brutal force through so-called "non-forcible repatriation"? Can't it be seen from this that the United States intends to continue to forcibly detain a large number of prisoners of war under the guise of so-called "non-forcible repatriation"? If the United States can detain prisoners of war in this way, then doesn't this mean advocating that other countries can do the same in retaliation? We are opposed to detaining prisoners of war under the guise of so-called "non-forcible repatriation." We believe that any individual or group with a sense of justice and humanitarian spirit throughout the world must not accept the US's so-called "non-forcible repatriation." On the contrary, what they should affirm is the principle of complete repatriation in accordance with the Geneva Convention, demanding that the detaining country has a responsibility to promptly release and repatriate all prisoners of war after the armistice agreement comes into effect, and has no right to use force and agents to detain prisoners of war.
    The United States also says that it wants to send prisoners of war to an agreed location and hand them over to neutral countries or "release" them without repatriation. This method also violates the Geneva Convention. The Geneva Convention stipulates that prisoners of war must be repatriated and handed over to their own side, because only in this way can the right of prisoners of war to be repatriated be guaranteed. If prisoners of war are handed over to neutral countries or "released," then prisoners of war will not be able to obtain the protection of their own side. The United States can then order its agents mixed among the prisoners of war to coerce prisoners of war who have been left with humiliating traces due to being tattooed and fingerprinted. The result will not be that the prisoners of war are repatriated, but that they continue to be forcibly detained.
    Some people are not unaware of the above principles, and are not blind to the harm that the US's so-called "non-forcible repatriation" or "voluntary repatriation" has inflicted on the Geneva Convention. However, intimidated by the pressure from the United States, they fantastically believe that surrendering to violent and illegal forces can satisfy this force and thus achieve peace. Therefore, they disregard the consequences of condoning violence and sacrificing the principles of international conventions, and will open the door for US imperialism to further and completely tear up international regulations, provoke everywhere, expand its war of aggression, and undermine world peace. However, we, the Chinese people, have defeated the Kuomintang reactionaries, the running dogs of US imperialism, under the brutal aggression of US imperialism and liberated our people. In the two years of the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, we have also defeated the aggression of US imperialism together with the heroic Korean People's Army. We already have rich experience in fighting US imperialism and deeply know that to stop aggression and achieve peace, it can never be achieved by sacrificing international conventions and condoning violent forces. On the contrary, we firmly believe that to resolve the prisoner of war issue, we must fully comply with the principles stipulated in international conventions, and make violent forces act in accordance with international regulations. Only in this way can true peace be achieved.
    We have always strived to resolve the prisoner of war issue in order to achieve an armistice in Korea. But the United States refuses to resolve this issue so that the war can continue. Obviously, the prisoner of war issue has been used by the United States as a tool to implement its policy of aggressive war. Under this vicious and dangerous method of the United States, the Korean armistice, which could have been achieved in April and May of this year, has been continuously prolonged for nearly seven months, and will continue to be prolonged. Therefore, people all over the world will continue to be deeply mired in the grave threat of war and continue to bear the heavy burden of war. This is beneficial for US monopoly capital to make profits, but it is a blow to the world people's desire for peace. The suggestion by Vyshinsky, head of the Soviet delegation, that a cease-fire be carried out first, and that the issue of complete repatriation of prisoners of war be handed over to the Committee for the Peaceful Resolution of the Korean Issue proposed by the Soviet Union, appropriately struck at the US's conspiracy to prolong and expand the war by using the prisoner of war issue, and found a way to realize the world people's desire to end the Korean War and eliminate the greater threat of war. We firmly advocate that the United Nations General Assembly immediately accept the Soviet proposal of November 10th and the supplementary proposal of November 24th, first implement a Korean armistice in accordance with the armistice agreement, and then immediately, in the eleven-nation committee proposed by the Soviet Union, fairly and reasonably resolve the issue of complete repatriation of prisoners of war in accordance with the principles of the Geneva Convention and the relevant provisions of the armistice agreement. This is the road required by peace-loving people all over the world, and this is the only road to a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. Peace-loving people all over the world must resolutely fight to the end for its realization.

    拥护周外长的声明
    十一月二十八日，我国外交部部长周恩来发表声明，拥护苏联出席联合国大会代表团团长维辛斯基十一月十日关于和平解决朝鲜问题的提案及十一月二十四日的补充建议：在朝鲜的交战双方按照双方已经同意的停战协定草案，立即完全停火，就是说双方停止一切陆、海、空军事行动，战俘全部遣返问题则交给苏联提案中所规定的由美国、英国、法国、苏联、中华人民共和国、印度、缅甸、瑞士、捷克斯洛伐克、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和南朝鲜组成的“和平解决朝鲜问题委员会”去解决；这个委员会并应本着由朝鲜人自己在这个委员会监督下统一朝鲜的精神，立即采取解决朝鲜问题的措施；在这个委员会中，一切问题要经过全体成员三分之二的多数赞成决定。全中国人民对苏联代表团团长维辛斯基的这个建议和我国周外长的声明表示完全的拥护和支持。
    朝鲜问题在联合国大会讨论了一个多月，全世界人民都看到在这一个多月的讨论中，苏联一开始就站在谋求朝鲜和平统一的立场，一再提出了设立和平解决朝鲜问题委员会来解决有关朝鲜和平统一以及朝鲜停战中的战俘遣返问题的建议。苏联十一月二十四日的补充建议尤其是满足世界爱好和平人民渴求朝鲜停战的热望的唯一方法。美国方面则一开始就压迫联合国大会来支持美国的所谓“不强迫遣返”的强迫扣留战俘主张，并使用各种压力来动员联合国大会各国，要他们帮忙美国进一步扩大侵略战争。从艾奇逊在联合国大会的历次演说到美国军政官员在这一时期发表的各种要求其他国家更多出钱出力在朝鲜发动所谓大攻势的言论中，人们看得十分清楚，美国是要把联合国第七届大会变成美国扩大侵略战争的工具。但是，由于苏联的坚强斗争，主张和平，并由于全世界人民，包括美国人民，对朝鲜问题和平解决的迫切要求，美国的如意算盘正在联合国碰到并不很如意的局面，不管他们如何顽固地坚持要以所谓“不强迫遣返”实即强迫扣留战俘的主张来阻碍朝鲜停战的实现，但这只有更进一步增加他们的侵略战争的困难和失败。
    整个朝鲜停战谈判的发展说明了下列事实：就是美国一贯提出无理主张来拖延谈判。特别是在遣俘问题上，美国坚持扣留战俘的所谓“自愿遣返”主张，从未作丝毫让步。每当谈判接近解决问题时，美国便节外生枝，另出花样来使这个问题遭逢新的困难，不得解决。十月八日美方竟不顾我方所提合理建议，擅自宣布无限期休会，中止谈判。十六个多月以来，仅仅是由于我方坚持公平合理的立场，才得以就停战协定草案六十三款取得协议。在战俘遣返问题上，我方根据日内瓦公约主张全部战俘无条件遣返，而在具体方法上，为了使人民所一致要求的停战得以早日实现，并为了使千万战俘得以早日回家，与其亲爱的家人们团聚，曾经多次提出合理折衷方案。十月十六日金日成彭德怀两将军致函克拉克，再度提出我方采纳了美方意见的解决遣返问题的建议，可是美国方面竟继续加以拒绝，坚持不肯恢复谈判。由此可见，我们是一贯努力要解决遣俘问题以取得停战，而美国则始终拒绝解决这个问题，以便延长和扩大战争。
    最近在联合国大会中，由于美国的压力，联合国大会中某些国家对于美国横暴破坏国际公约，企图利用遣俘问题来完全破裂谈判，扩大战争的阴谋和危险，竟置之不顾，而一味希图以牺牲国际公约关于无条件遣返战俘的庄严规定，来将就美国的所谓“不强迫遣返”、“自愿遣返”或“不以武力遣返”，实即强迫扣留战俘主张。在美国压力下产生的包括这种意图的提案，实际上就正以美国的“自愿遣返”、“不强迫遣返”或“不以武力遣返”为其实施的原则，其结果就是美国的“自愿遣返”。
    美国的所谓“自愿遣返”、“不强迫遣返”或“不以武力遣返”是根本违反日内瓦公约和停战协定草案的。因为战俘是被敌方以武力俘获并控制的对方交战人员。在被拘留期间，他们是处在被强迫状态之下而不得自由的人。对于他们，最自由的状态和最人道的待遇就是在停战之后，解除对他们的武力控制，把他们遣返回家，恢复自由。正因如此，所以日内瓦公约不仅规定战争终止后，战俘要立即无条件全部遣返，而且还规定在任何情况下战俘不得放弃遣返回家的权利，以杜绝任何利用所谓“不强迫遣返”来强迫扣留战俘的可能性。朝鲜交战双方根据日内瓦公约的精神而协议的停战协定草案，也规定了在停战协定生效后，双方须迅速释放与遣返全部战俘。美国政府明明知道这些规定，也明知道他们的主张是在破坏国际公约。可是，为了坚持扣留战俘以便扩大战争，他们竟横蛮至于公开主张不遵守这些国际公约，例如美国出席联合国大会代表团团员罗斯福夫人就公开在“纽约世界电讯太阳报”上主张：美国不能过于彻底地遵守各种国际公约。我们知道，在第二次世界大战以前，正由于世界上某些国家纵容了希特勒任意撕毁国际条约，才使人类遭受到那一场惨酷的灾难。这个教训是人们应该深深记住的。
    从事实上说，美国的所谓“不强迫遣返”更是它有意捏造来扣留战俘的工具。美国战俘营里的血腥事实是：美国使用大批蒋介石李承晚的特务以虐待、屠杀、强打指印、强迫刺字来对战俘进行非法的所谓“甄别”，威逼并以引诱性问题迫使战俘违背他们的爱国感情来承受侮辱的标记。尽管如此，我方被俘人员却坚决抗拒美国的这些暴行以致牺牲了许多性命。这是由美国方面的许多个人和团体所明白承认了的。现在，美国却硬说朝中方面被俘人员不愿回家，因而就要“不强迫遣返”。这里说明了一个什么道理呢？难道这不是说明美国要将它的以残暴武力强迫甄别扣留战俘的不法行为，用所谓“不强迫遣返”来加以合法化么？难道从这里还不能看出美国打算以所谓“不强迫遣返”来继续强迫扣留大批战俘？假如美国可以这样扣留战俘，那么，这岂不是主张其他国家也可以照样来作，以作报复？我们是反对以所谓“不强迫遣返”来扣留战俘的。我们认为全世界有正义感和人道精神的任何个人任何团体都绝不能接受美国的所谓“不强迫遣返”，正相反，他们所应该肯定的倒是根据日内瓦公约全部遣返的原则，要求拘留国在停战协定生效后有责任迅速释放与遣返全部战俘，而没有权利使用武力和特务来扣留战俘。
    美国又说要把战俘送到一个协议地点交给中立国或将他们“释放”，不予遣返。这个办法也是违背日内瓦公约的。日内瓦公约规定战俘必须遣返交给他们的所属一方，因为只有如此，才能保障战俘被遣返的权利。如果将战俘交给中立国或“释放”，则战俘就不可能得到他们自己所属一方的保护。美国就可以令其混杂在战俘中的特务对因已被刺字和被打指印而留下了耻辱痕迹的战俘进行胁迫，这样的结果就不是战俘被遣返，而是他们继续被强迫扣留。
    有些人对于上述道理不是不明白的，对于美国所谓“不强迫遣返”或“自愿遣返”所加之于日内瓦公约的危害，不是看不见的。但是，他们慑于美国的压力，幻想地以为向强暴违法势力屈服，就可以使这种势力满意从而取得和平。因此，他们就不去顾及这一纵容强暴、牺牲国际公约原则的后果，将为美帝国主义进一步彻底撕毁国际法规，到处挑衅、扩大侵略战争，破坏世界和平大开方便之门。但是，我们中国人民是从美帝国主义者的强暴侵略之下战胜了美帝国主义的走狗国民党反动派而解放了自己的人民的。在两年来的抗美援朝战争中，又已和英勇的朝鲜人民军一道击败了美帝国主义的侵略，我们已经有了丰富的对美帝国主义者斗争的经验，深深知道要制止侵略，取得和平，绝不是以牺牲国际公约、纵容强暴势力而能取得的。正相反，我们坚决认为要解决遣俘问题，必须完全遵守国际公约所规定的原则，使强暴势力按着国际规定来办事。只有这样，才能取得真正和平。
    我们始终是努力要解决遣俘问题以争取朝鲜停战的实现的。但美国则拒绝解决这个问题以便战争继续下去。显然地，遣俘问题已经被美国用来作为贯彻其侵略战争政策的工具。在美国这种恶毒凶险的办法之下，本来在本年四五月间即可实现的朝鲜停战竟被继续延长了近七个月之久，而且还要延长下去。因此，全世界人民将要继续深陷于战争的重大威胁之中，继续负荷战争的沉重负担。这对于美国垄断资本取得利润是有利的，而对于世界人民的和平愿望则是一个打击。苏联代表团团长维辛斯基关于先行停战，将战俘全部遣返问题交给苏联所提的和平解决朝鲜问题委员会处理的建议，恰当地打击了美国利用遣俘问题来延长并扩大战争的阴谋，替世界人民要求结束朝鲜战争，解除更大的战争威胁的愿望，找到了一条实现的道路。我们坚决主张联合国大会立即接受苏联十一月十日的提案及十一月二十四日的补充建议，首先按照停战协定，实现朝鲜停战，然后立即在苏联所提十一国委员会中，根据日内瓦公约和停战协定有关条款的原则，来公平合理地解决战俘全部遣返问题。这是全世界爱好和平人民所要求的道路，这也是和平解决朝鲜问题的唯一道路。全世界爱好和平人民必须为其实现而坚决奋斗到底。
