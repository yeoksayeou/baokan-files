Implementing the Three-Dimensional Staggered Parallel Assembly Line Method
    The Tenth Construction Site of the Northeast Industrial Department Builds a Floor in Six Days
    The Tenth Construction Site of the Fifth Engineering Office of the First Engineering Company of the Northeast Industrial Department, when constructing a three-story building (with an area of 2,700 square meters and a reinforced concrete structure), implemented the three-dimensional staggered parallel assembly line construction method, creating a new record of building one floor in six days. The three-dimensional staggered parallel assembly line method was jointly created by Qi Zhongyi, Zhang Keren, the director of the construction site, and the workers. Its characteristics are: when bricklayers begin to build the walls, carpenters immediately begin to erect supports, and use the supports as interior scaffolding for the bricklayers to build the inner walls; after the carpenters erect the supports, they begin to erect formwork on top, with the steel workers advancing along with the carpenters. In order to prevent the carpenters and bricklayers from interfering with each other, when the bricklayers are building the inner walls, the carpenters erect the formwork from the outer walls inward; when the bricklayers finish building the inner walls and turn to the outer walls, the carpenters begin to erect the inner wall formwork. In this way, the bricklayers and carpenters are staggered, and operations can be carried out simultaneously above and below. When the bricklayers finish building the walls, the carpenters have also erected the formwork, and the steel workers have also tied the steel bars, so the concrete pouring work can begin. Then the carpenters, bricklayers, and steel workers move on to another section. In this way, each floor only takes about three days to build the walls, and the carpenters and steel workers do not occupy the construction period because they operate simultaneously with the bricklayers. In addition, it takes three days for concrete pouring and curing, so one floor can be built in six days.
    Formulating a meticulous plan and making it the action of the masses is a prerequisite for ensuring that this advanced construction experience plays its role. When the construction site implemented the three-dimensional staggered parallel assembly line method, the construction site administrative leaders formulated a comprehensive construction plan based on the construction method (including the construction progress plan for each ten-day period and each day, and the material, labor, and tool supply plan). At the same time, the construction site director explained the benefits of this method to the cadres, carefully calculated the construction period occupied by each type of work, and increased everyone's confidence. After the cadres reached a consensus, the construction instruction diagram for each worker group (stipulating how much to complete each day, in which section, and what the quality requirements are, etc.) was handed over to the workers for discussion. The Su Changyou model group took the lead in responding to the construction site's call, thus ensuring the completion of one floor in six days. (Li Chengxue)

    实行立体交错平行流水作业法
    东北工业部第十工地六天盖好一层楼
    东北工业部第一工程公司第五工程处第十工地，在修建一幢三层大楼（面积为二千七百平方公尺，钢筋混凝土结构）时，实行了立体交错平行流水作业施工法，创造了六天盖好一层楼的新纪录。立体交错平行流水作业法是该工地主任齐忠义、张克仁和工人们共同创造的。它的特点是：当瓦工开始砌墙时，木工即开始立支柱，并利用支柱作里脚给瓦工砌里墙；木工立好支柱后，即开始在上面支模型板，铁筋工随着木工前进。为了使木工、瓦工不互相妨碍，瓦工砌里墙时，木工便由外墙向内支模型板；当瓦工砌完里墙转到外墙时，木工便开始进行支内墙模型板。这样，瓦工、木工错开，上、下可以同时进行操作。瓦工砌完墙时，木工也把模型板支好了，铁筋工也扎好铁筋，打混凝土的工作便可以开始。而木工、瓦工、铁筋工就转到另一工段。这样每一层楼只须三天左右便可砌完墙，而木工、铁筋工由于与瓦工同时进行操作不占工期，另外打混凝土及养护三天，这样六天就可以盖好一层楼。
    制订周密的计划并使之成为群众的行动，是保证这个先进的施工经验发挥效用的先决条件。该工地实行立体交错平行流水作业法时，工地行政领导根据施工法制订了全面的施工计划（包括每旬、每日施工进度计划，材料、劳动力、工具供应计划），同时工地主任又把这个方法的好处向干部讲清楚，细致地算出每工种所占工期，提高大家信心。在干部认识取得一致后，即将每个工人小组施工指示图
    （规定每天完成多少，在那一工段、质量要求如何等），交给工人讨论。苏长有模范小组带头响应了工地的号召，因而保证了六天完成一层楼。（李成学）
