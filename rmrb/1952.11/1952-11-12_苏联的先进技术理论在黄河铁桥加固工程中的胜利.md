    The Victory of Advanced Soviet Technology Theory in the Yellow River Iron Bridge Reinforcement Project
    Liu Jianzhang, Director of the Zhengzhou Railway Administration

    In January 1950, when the first reinforcement project of the Zhengzhou Yellow River Iron Bridge was completed, an engineer from a certain place saw the news in the newspaper, "Train crosses the Yellow River Bridge in 22 minutes," and refused to believe it. He specially bought a train ticket and traveled two thousand miles to Zhengzhou to cross the bridge by train once before he was convinced. Now the Yellow River Bridge has undergone five reinforcement projects. When people see large locomotives pulling over-axle trains across the turbulent Yellow River at a speed of 45 kilometers per hour in four minutes, they will surely marvel at this miracle.

    The rebirth of the Yellow River Bridge is indeed a miracle created by the combination of the great creativity of the Chinese working class and the scientific technical theories of Soviet experts. This bridge, the first large bridge in China with a total length of three kilometers, has a history of fifty years. This bridge was inherently deficient from the start. From the time it was newly built, capitalist engineers limited the train speed on this bridge to 15 kilometers per hour, and the warranty period was 15 years. In the more than 40 years before liberation, this bridge suffered from the destruction and torment of imperialism, feudal warlords, and the Kuomintang reactionaries. During the warlord civil wars and the Japanese occupation, it suffered multiple destructions, which reduced the train speed to 5 kilometers per hour. After the Kuomintang reactionary government took over, the condition of the bridge deteriorated day by day. The steel rails were uneven, the screws were loose, and the sleepers were skewed. From a distance, the track looked like a winding snake. When the locomotive moved, it swayed left and right, nodding up and down, as sluggish as an ox cart. A passenger train had to be towed twice to pass the bridge. The distance from the South Bank Station of the Yellow River to the North Bank Station was only five kilometers, but passengers had to endure three hours on the train. The Kuomintang reactionary government invited the American "bridge expert" Waddell in 1930. This swindler sat on the train and strolled across the bridge. Without getting off the train, he arbitrarily said: "The old bridge has passed its warranty period and cannot be used unless a new bridge is built." After the American swindler cheated the design fee, he only sent an assistant to drive half a pile, and there was no news. In 1946, the American Morrison Company was entrusted to design a new bridge, and another 100,000 US dollars in design fees were swindled, and the result was still no follow-up.

    In 1949, the Jinghan Railway line was liberated, and the Yellow River Iron Bridge became the property of the people. However, in the early days of liberation, some cadres leading the project were influenced by the corrupt management methods of capitalism and conservative ideas. They did not pay attention to the maintenance of the bridge but unrealistically placed their hopes on rebuilding a new bridge, so the Yellow River Bridge was still in a state of paralysis. That winter, Soviet experts Kingorianko and Cyrin, who assisted our country in railway construction, came to the bridge. They understood the entire history of the Yellow River Bridge, and then, with hammers in hand, climbed under the bridge to carefully inspect and study the condition of the bridge piers and steel beams. Finally, they concluded that this bridge, after being reinforced and well maintained, could not only increase its load-bearing capacity but also be used normally. This correct judgment was strongly opposed by individual leading cadres and some engineering personnel at the time. They said: "The Yellow River Bridge has passed two warranty periods, just like a dead person, how can it be resurrected?" "The Yellow River Bridge bridge piles are suspended in the air, just like a centipede floating on the water, how can it continue to run trains!" The leading organs of the Ministry of Railways criticized this conservative thinking and resolutely adopted the opinions of the Soviet experts. According to the needs of railway transportation development, from December 1949 to the end of October 1952, five reinforcement projects were carried out in a planned and focused manner, gradually increasing the load-bearing capacity of the bridge.

    The first reinforcement project took only ten days and 3,135 workdays to significantly change the face of the Yellow River Bridge. The train passage time was shortened to 22 minutes. In the first reinforcement project, the bridge surface was tidied up, and the past phenomenon of uneven steel rails, skewed sleepers, and unstraight tracks was changed. The damaged upper chord of the 15th hole steel beam and the poorly supported No. 22 pier were improved, and then the train operation method was changed. In the past, a train was pulled twice by a small locomotive. After reinforcement, the entire train was pulled across the bridge by two small locomotives at once. The train speed increased from 5 kilometers per hour to 10 kilometers per hour.

    In order to further improve the bridge condition and train safety equipment, the second reinforcement project was carried out from February to March 1950. In this project, guard rails were laid, and the line conditions on the bridge and at the bridgeheads were improved, making train travel safer.

    In the third reinforcement project, the upper structure of the bridge was thoroughly improved, so large locomotives began to pass. From May to September 1950, 97-hole steel beams were reinforced and repaired, and all bridge deck systems were replaced. At the beginning of the reinforcement, conservatives opposed again: "Reinforcing the upper part alone is like wearing a fur coat with bare feet. How can large locomotives run!" They did not understand the role of phased construction and passively delayed the reinforcement project. By mid-July, only 5% of the entire project had been completed. Teng Daiyuan, Minister of the Ministry of Railways, personally came to inspect and made severe criticisms. This aroused the attention of relevant departments. The materials department supplied materials in a timely manner, the finance department allocated funds in a timely manner, the personnel department deployed labor, and the engineering department deployed machinery and equipment. Engineer Li Jiaqi of the Ministry of Railways and engineers from the Engineering Department of the Administration Bureau and the Engineering Section of the Sub-bureau personally went to the site to help with the work. The workers showed high labor enthusiasm and put forward the slogan "Overcome difficulties and strive to complete the task ahead of schedule." Inventions, rationalization proposals, and new records continued to emerge. Riveter Zhang Lu improved the hand-moved drilling frame, increasing the number of holes drilled per day from 20 to 120, increasing efficiency by six times, which enabled the completion of all 118,000 drilling projects 32 days ahead of schedule. Moving steel beams was reduced from 18 workdays per hole to 6.5 workdays, increasing efficiency by 2.7 times. Tightening screws was increased from 40 per workday to 110, increasing efficiency by 2.7 times. Due to the close cooperation of various departments and the initiative and creativity of engineers and workers, the entire project was completed 12 days ahead of schedule, and the "MK6" large locomotive passed for the first time. When the train passed, it was not necessary to change to small locomotives on both sides of the Yellow River, which shortened the stop time of each train at the station by half an hour.

    The fourth reinforcement project was carried out from April to June 1951, focusing on reinforcing the lower structure of the bridge, such as replacing temporary tie rods with steel rail tie rods and strengthening the connection of bridge piles so that they could evenly support the upper load. At the same time, Soviet expert Gikhnov suggested using steel rail piles to repair the damaged piers, and in order to dispel general doubts, he personally participated in the experimental work. The test results proved that the bearing capacity of the new steel rail piles and the old pipe piles was sufficient to meet the load standard for the passage of "MK1" large locomotives. For preventing riverbed scouring, the project of using firewood rows to protect piers was also proposed, and after testing, the results were good. These tests consolidated the confidence in carrying out the fifth reinforcement project, and the fallacies of "centipede floating on water" and "wearing a fur coat with bare feet" were declared bankrupt.

    The fifth reinforcement project was carried out from June 1951 to the end of October 1952 to solve the problems that had not been solved in previous reinforcement projects. Such as repairing damaged piers, adjusting bridge height, replacing all new steel beams, and reinforcing bridge boxes, etc., so that the upper, middle, and lower parts of the entire bridge reached a balanced strength to increase the load-bearing capacity of the entire bridge and create a solid foundation for the passage of large locomotives without speed restrictions. In the work of lowering high piers and adjusting bridge height, serious difficulties were encountered. For example, the original plan was to use wooden piles to lift the steel beams, but the river was deep and the current was rapid, and the impact force was large, so the piling work could not be carried out. However, after discussion by the workers, Han Qingchun, the hoisting foreman, put forward a rationalization proposal. He suggested using the original four side piles on both sides of the bridge pier as a foundation (two on each side), buckling steel rails on the two side piles on each side, and then erecting single beams on the steel rails to support the steel beams. This method was not only safe but also saved materials and improved work efficiency. Preliminary calculations showed that the saved piling material costs and ferry fees were worth more than 50 million yuan, and the beam erection task was completed ahead of schedule. Ren Yunqing, the riveter foreman, suggested using a wind sand wheel to replace human labor to grind the steel rail heads. In the past, each worker ground three heads, but after the improvement, each worker ground one hundred heads, increasing efficiency by more than thirty times.

    All five reinforcement projects were carried out without interrupting traffic, that is to say: only a certain period of time was specified for construction blocking each day, and traffic was continued to be maintained at other times. It was difficult to complete the planned project and restore the state where normal traffic could pass within the specified time. Especially in the fourth and fifth reinforcement projects, it was very difficult to complete complicated work such as lifting bridges, lowering piers, piling, replacing beams, and laying tracks in a short period of time without affecting traffic. Therefore, before the start of construction, some people believed that transportation must be stopped for two months or one month, and work should be done day and night. However, after Vice Minister of Railways Lü Zhengcao and Soviet expert Gikhnov checked, they pointed out that it was not appropriate to stop transportation on the Jinghan Railway main line for a month, and ways must be found to carry out the reinforcement project while maintaining traffic. The workers accepted the original plan of interrupting traffic twice a day for a total of ten hours, and put forward many rationalization proposals and inventions in their work, greatly improving work efficiency and gradually shortening the construction blocking time to 7.5 hours, 5 hours, and 4 hours.

    The key to maintaining uninterrupted traffic for reinforcement projects is to strengthen the planning of work. Every night, the bridge work captain and engineers convened foremen and team leaders for a meeting to understand the progress of each team's work and determine the work plan for the next day. Each team had a clear division of labor, and the work of lifting bridges, smoothing slopes, temporary reinforcement, piling, and replacing beams was well coordinated. Party members and Youth League members played a guaranteeing role. Before dawn, the cadres got up. At five o'clock, as soon as the bell rang, the workers walked to the site with their tools. Electric train drivers and material suppliers were always "the first to go out and the last to return." Dispatchers buried their heads in thought, finding time on the train operation chart. Station personnel quickly conveyed orders, opened and closed switches, and dispatched vehicles. The switchmen at the bridgeheads worked nervously to save every minute or even every second. The workers were half-immersed in the water in the cold April weather. In foggy weather, erecting beams was even more difficult, and if not careful, the bridge would fall into the water. But the workers finally overcame the difficulties.

    After five reinforcements, the Yellow River Iron Bridge has become younger and stronger. Now, the train speed has been increased from 5 kilometers per hour to unlimited speed; the type of locomotives running has been changed from the small "MX6" to the large "MK1"; the operation mode has been changed from divided operation to whole train operation; the number of tons of goods pulled each time has been increased from 600 tons to 2,000 tons; and the number of tons transported per day has increased ten times. This has eliminated the transportation bottleneck of the Jinghan main line and guaranteed the smooth flow of materials between the north and the south.

    The entire process of the Yellow River Bridge reinforcement project is a process of struggle between advanced socialist ideology and backward capitalist conservative ideology. The leading organs of the Ministry of Railways adhered to the correct reinforcement policy, and therefore the reinforcement project was successfully completed. The great internationalist spirit of Soviet experts, their scientific technical theories, their thinking of cherishing national property, and their in-depth and pragmatic working style promoted the reinforcement of the Yellow River Bridge. The entire reinforcement project and maintenance plan were determined by Comrade Kingorianko. Comrade Gikhnov provided specific guidance. He went to the construction site nine times, carefully inspecting each time, and not letting go of even a small bolt and rivet. He especially cared about the safety of train travel and workers, and suggested laying guard rails, pedestrian boards, and adding railings to the bridge from the very beginning. Last spring, he was ill in Beijing. When he heard that the Yellow River Bridge reinforcement project had encountered technical difficulties, he specially traveled from Beijing despite his illness. Everyone was worried about his health, but he said: "My illness will be cured as soon as I get to the Yellow River Bridge." After his two days of inspection and research, the illness of the Yellow River Bridge was also cured. The workers all called him the doctor of the Yellow River Bridge. Engineering technicians and workers improved their political awareness in a series of political movements such as the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, and democratic reforms, and therefore gave play to great initiative and creativity, which was an important guarantee for the Yellow River Bridge reinforcement project. They put forward many rationalization proposals, and from August to October this year, they put forward 121 items. When they saw the labor results they had created with their own hands when the large locomotive passed on November 20 last year, they shouted and sang to the oncoming large locomotive: "We endured the summer and arrived in winter, overcoming many difficulties of lifting bridges, piling, lowering piers, and erecting beams. Today, large locomotives are passing. Our working class has strength!" Liu Hongjun, the captain of the sixty-year-old engineer, said to everyone he met: "We have won a great victory!"

    Our country's economic construction is developing rapidly, and the efficiency of railway transportation must continue to be improved, and existing equipment must continue to be improved. The reinforcement of the Yellow River Bridge points out the direction for us. We carried out the reinforcement project with 13% of the cost of the original new bridge, which made the load capacity of the Yellow River Bridge exceed that of the original new bridge. If the money saved from not rebuilding the new bridge is calculated at a monthly interest rate of 8.1%, the interest for the next ten years will reach 420 billion yuan. This amount of money can build one and a half new bridges, buy 280 fighter jets, buy 6 million bags of flour, and build 1 million square meters of houses. The reinforcement of the old bridge was carried out in phases in conjunction with the development of transportation volume. For the past three years, normal transportation has been guaranteed. However, it takes more than two years to rebuild a new bridge, and the old bridge still has to bear the transportation tasks during this period, and it is still necessary to reinforce the old bridge, which will further increase national expenditure.

    The successful fact of the Yellow River Bridge reinforcement project educates us: we must learn from the Soviet Union - this is our direction. (Attached picture)

    苏联的先进技术理论在黄河铁桥加固工程中的胜利
    郑州铁路管理局局长  刘建章
    一九五○年一月，当郑州黄河大铁桥完成了第一次加固工程时，某地有位工程师从报上看到了“二十二分钟，列车过完黄河大桥”的消息，还不肯相信，特地买了车票从二千里外赶来郑州，坐车过桥一次，方才信服。现在黄河桥已进行了五次加固工程。当人们看见大型机车拉着超轴的列车以每小时四十五公里的速度在四分钟内越过滚滚的黄河时，一定会惊叹这是个奇迹。
    黄河桥的新生，确是中国工人阶级的伟大创造力和苏联专家科学的技术理论相结合而产生的奇迹。这座全长三公里的中国第一座大桥，已有五十年的历史了。这座桥原来就是先天不足的。从新建起，资本主义国家的工程师就把这座桥的行车速度限制为每小时十五公里，保固期限是十五年。解放前的四十多年中，这座桥受尽了帝国主义、封建军阀和国民党反动派的摧残和折磨。在军阀内战和日寇占领时期，遭受多次破坏，使行车速度降低到每小时五公里。国民党反动政府劫收后，桥梁状态一天比一天恶化，钢轨不平，螺丝松动，枕木歪斜，远远望去，那轨道就像蜿蜒曲折的长蛇一样。机车走动时，左右摇摆，上下点头，像牛车那样迟钝。一列客车通过这座桥，也得分两次牵引。黄河南岸车站到北岸车站的距离不过五公里，但旅客得在车上熬上三小时。国民党反动政府于一九三○年曾请来了美国的“桥梁专家”瓦德尔，这个骗子坐在火车上从桥上蹓了一趟，未下车，就武断地说：“旧桥已过保固期限，不能使用，除非另建新桥。”美国骗子把设计费骗走以后，只派了一个助手试打了半截桩，再无消息。一九四六年又委托美国马力生公司设计新桥，又骗走设计费十万元美金，结果是又没有下文。
    一九四九年京汉沿线解放，黄河铁桥归为人民所有。但在解放初期，某些领导工程的干部受资本主义的腐朽的经营管理方法和保守主义思想影响，不重视桥梁的维修，而脱离实际地把希望寄于重建新桥上，因而黄河桥仍在瘫痪状态中。那年冬天，协助我国建设铁路的苏联专家金果琏珂和西林同志来到了桥上，他们了解了黄河桥的全部经历，然后拿着铁锤，爬到桥下，仔细检查和研究了桥墩、钢梁的状况，最后得出结论：这座桥，经过加固，并好好养护，不但可提高承载力，而且可正常使用下去。这一正确判断，为当时个别领导干部及部分工程人员所强烈反对，他们说：“黄河桥已过了两个保固期，好比死去了的人，岂能复活？”“黄河桥桥桩空悬，好比蜈蚣浮在水面，怎能继续行驶火车！”铁道部领导机关批判了这种保守思想，坚决采纳了苏联专家的意见，根据铁路运输发展的需要，从一九四九年十二月起至一九五二年十月底止，有计划有重点地进行了五次加固工程，逐步提高桥梁的荷重力。
    第一次加固工程，只花了十天时间，三千一百三十五工日，就显著地改变了黄河桥的面貌。列车通过时间，缩短到二十二分钟。在第一次加固工程中，整理了桥面，改变了过去钢轨不平、枕木歪斜、轨道不直的现象，改进了第十五孔钢梁损坏的上弦和支撑不良的第二十二号墩，然后改变行车方式。过去一列车由小机车分两次牵引，加固后，由两辆小机车，一次牵引整个列车过桥。行车速度从每小时五公里提高到十公里。
    为了进一步改善桥梁状况和行车安全设备，从一九五○年二月至三月进行了第二次加固工程。在这次工程中，铺设了护轮轨，改善了桥上与桥头的线路状况，使行车安全更有保障。
    在第三次加固工程中，彻底地改善桥梁的上部构造，因而开始通行大型机车。从一九五○年五月至九月，加固和补修了九十七孔钢梁，更换全部桥面系。加固开始时，保守主义者又反对了：“单加固上部，岂不是穿皮袄打光脚，怎能走大型机车！”而不了解分期施工的作用，对加固工程消极拖延。至七月中旬，全部工程只完成百分之五。铁道部滕代远部长亲来视察，提出了严厉的批评。这样才引起有关部门重视。材料部门及时供应材料，财务部门及时拨发工款，人事部门调配劳动力，工务部门调配机械设备，铁道部李家麒工程师以及管理局工务处、分局工务科的工程师们亲自到现场帮助工作。工人同志发挥了高度劳动热情，提出“克服困难，争取提前完成任务”的口号。发明创造、合理化建议和新纪录不断出现。铆工张禄改进了手搬钻架子，每天钻眼从二十个提高到一百二十个，效率提高六倍，使全部十一万八千多钻眼工程提前三十二天完成。移动钢梁，由每孔十八个工减到六个半工，效率提高二点七倍。上螺丝由每工四十个提高到一百一十个，效率提高二点七倍。由于各部门密切配合和工程师、工人群众发挥了积极性和创造性，因而提前了十二天完成全部工程，第一次通行冖ㄎ六大型机车。列车通过时，不必在黄河两岸更换小型机车，使每列车在站上停留时间又缩短了半小时。
    一九五一年四月至六月进行第四次加固工程，着重地加固桥梁下部构造，如更换临时拉杆为钢轨拉杆，加强桥桩的联系，使能均衡地支承上部载重。同时，苏联专家吉赫诺夫同志建议使用钢轨桩修复坏墩，并为了解除一般人的怀疑亲自参加了试验的工作。试验结果证明：新钢轨桩与旧管桩的承载能力都足够通行冖ㄎ一大型机车的载重标准。对于防止河床冲刷，又提出了柴排护墩工程，经试验，结果良好。这些试验，巩固了进行第五次加固工程的信心，过去那些“蜈蚣浮水”、“上穿皮袄下光脚”的谬论宣告破产了。
    从一九五一年六月至一九五二年十月底进行了第五次加固工程，以解决过去各次加固工程所没有解决的问题。如修复坏墩，调整桥高，全部换新钢梁，加固桥箱等，使整个桥梁的上、中、下各部分达到均衡的强度，以提高整个桥梁的载重力，为通行大型机车而不限制速度，创造了坚强的基础。在降落高墩、调整桥高的工作中，曾遭到严重困难。如原计划用木桩来托起钢梁，但河水深而流动急，冲击力大，打桩工作无法进行。但经过工人群众讨论后，装吊工长韩庆春同志提出了合理化建议，他建议利用桥墩两边原有的四根边桩为基础（每边两根），在每边两根边桩上扣上钢轨，再在钢轨上架上单便梁把钢梁承托起来。这一做法既安全，又节省工料，提高了工作效率。初步计算，节省的打桩工料费及渡船费等价值五千多万元，并提前完成了架梁任务。铆工领工员任云青建议用风砂轮代替人力磨钢轨头。过去每工磨三个头，改进后每工磨一百个头，效率提高了三十多倍。
    所有五次加固工程，都是在不间断行车中进行的，也就是说：每天只规定一定的遮断工事的时间，其余时间继续维持行车。要在规定时间内完成预计的工程，恢复到可以正常通车的状态，是有困难的。特别在第四次、第五次加固工程中，要在短时间内做完起桥、落墩、打桩、换梁、铺轨等等复杂工作，而不影响行车，困难是很多的。因此开工前，有人认为必须停止运输两个月或一个月，日夜赶工。但经铁道部吕正操副部长和苏联专家吉赫诺夫同志检查以后，指出京汉铁路干线停止运输一个月是不应该的，必须在维持行车中想办法来进行加固工程。工人们接受了原定每天中断行车两次共十小时的计划，并在工作中提出很多合理化建议和发明创造，大大提高了工作效率，使遮断工事的时间逐步缩短到七点五小时、五小时、四小时。
    维持不间断行车进行加固工程的关键在于加强工作的计划性。每天晚上，桥工队长、工程师召集领工员、工长开碰头会，了解各组工作进度的情况，确定次日的工作计划。各组明确分工，把起桥、顺坡、临时加固、打桩、换梁等工作很好地配合起来。党员、团员起保证作用。在天没亮的时候，干部们就起身了。五点钟，铃一响，工友们就拿着工具走上现场。电车司机和材料供应人员总是“先人而出，后人而归”。调度人员埋头沉思地在列车运行图上找时间。车站人员迅速传达命令，开闭道岔，调配车辆。桥头的转辙员为了争取每一分钟甚至每一秒钟而紧张地工作着。工人们在四月的冷天里，半截身子浸在水里。在雾天，架梁更不容易，稍不谨慎，桥梁就会落下水去。但工人们终于战胜了困难。
    经过五次加固的黄河铁桥已变得年青了，壮健了。现在，行车速度已从每小时五公里提高到可以不加限制；行驶的机车类型已从小型的攵?六改为大型的冖ㄎ一；运转方式已从分割运转改为整列运转；每次牵引货物吨数从六百吨提高到二千吨；每日运送吨数提高了十倍。从此消除了京汉干线的运输疙瘩，保证南北物资的畅流。
    整个黄河桥的加固工程的过程，就是先进的社会主义思想与落后的资本主义保守思想之间的斗争过程。铁道部的领导机关坚持了正确的加固方针，因而顺利地完成了加固工程。苏联专家的伟大国际主义精神，科学的技术理论，爱护国家的财产的思想和深入的实事求是的工作作风，推动了黄河桥的加固工作。全部加固工程与养护计划是金果琏珂同志确定的。吉赫诺夫同志作了具体指导，他曾九至工地，每次细致地检查，小至一个螺栓和铆钉都不放过，他特别关心行车与工人的安全，一开始就建议铺设护轨、人行板、加修桥旁栏杆。去年春天，他在北京有病，听说黄河桥加固工程遭到了技术上的困难，他特地抱病从北京赶来。大家都担心他的健康，他说：“我一到黄河桥，病就好了。”经过他两天的检查和研究，黄河桥的病也好了。工人们都称呼他是黄河桥的医生。工程技术人员与工人群众在抗美援朝、镇压反革命、民主改革等一系列政治运动中，提高了政治觉悟，因而发挥了伟大积极性和创造性，这是黄河桥加固工程的重要保证。他们提出了不少合理化建议，从今年八月至十月，就提出了一百二十一件。当去年十一月二十日通行大型机车时，他们看到自己亲手创造的劳动成果，对着迎面开来的大型机车，欢呼歌唱：“我们熬过夏天，到了冬天，战胜了起桥、打桩、落墩、架梁的许多困难，到今天通行了大机车，咱们工人阶级有力量！”六十多岁的老工程师刘鸿钧队长逢人便说：“我们打了个大胜仗！”
    我们的祖国的经济建设在飞跃发展，铁路运输效能必须继续提高，现有设备必须继续改进。黄河桥的加固给我们指出了方向。我们以相当于原建新桥费用的百分之十三，进行加固工程，而使黄河桥负荷能力超过了原建新桥。如果把重建新桥少花的费用按月利八点一厘计算，则今后十年的利息即达四千二百亿元。这笔费用可以修一座半新桥，可以买二百八十架战斗机，可以买六百万袋面粉，可以造一百万平方公尺的房屋。旧桥加固是结合运输量的发展而分期进行的。三年来，一直保证了正常运输。但要重建新桥，需要两年多时间，在此期间的运输任务仍要由旧桥负担，仍需要加固旧桥，将更多地增加国家支出。
    黄河桥的加固工程成功的事实教育我们：我们必须向苏联学习——这就是我们的方向。（附图片）
