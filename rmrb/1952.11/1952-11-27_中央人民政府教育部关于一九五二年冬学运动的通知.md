The national conference on eliminating illiteracy had some discussion about this year's winter literacy campaign in September. Judging from the recent progress in various regions, some regions feel that the policy is not clear enough, and some regions have not made practical arrangements. This notice is hereby reissued, and it is hoped that all regions will discuss and arrange it in light of local conditions.

I. The creation of the quick literacy method provides an effective method for eliminating illiteracy. Experiments have proven that rapid concentrated learning is indeed effective. Promoting this method can indeed accelerate the process of improving the cultural and political level of farmers, and thus promote national construction. However, after rapid learning, consolidation work must continue. Otherwise, a large number of "relapses" will not achieve the goal of eliminating illiteracy. This winter and next spring, the tasks of rural work are still very heavy, and the preparations are not sufficient. Therefore, the nationwide campaign to eliminate illiteracy should adopt the policy of preparing cadres and conducting key trials this winter and next year. It is not appropriate or possible to promote it universally. In the vast rural areas this winter, the winter literacy campaign should still be carried out, and literacy education should be carried out for the peasant masses according to past experience, combined with current affairs, policy education, and ideological education in light of local central work.

II. To promote quick literacy teaching, it is necessary to do the necessary preparatory work such as training teachers and preparing teaching materials, and to focus on promoting it in areas, villages, and townships with suitable conditions. Avoid spreading it out in an all-round way without any preparation, which will make the work unconsolidated and create great difficulties for the future development of the movement. Therefore, it is necessary to select key points based on the original civilian schools, absorb young and middle-aged civilian school students or semi-literate people with a little literacy to form quick literacy classes for teaching. The purpose is to actively create and accumulate experience in promoting quick literacy methods in rural areas, and to obtain systematic and practical experience and make organizational preparations for the future large-scale rural literacy campaign in the country. Therefore, leaders should not simply pursue quantity, but more importantly, seek the actual effect of eliminating illiteracy. In key promotion areas and schools, leadership must be strengthened, teaching methods of teachers must be continuously improved, the slack season in winter must be seized, other activities must be reduced, and efforts must be concentrated to complete the teaching task of rapid concentrated literacy this winter and next spring, so that after the end of the winter literacy campaign, it can be transferred to the consolidation stage and continue to study in regular civilian schools to consolidate the learning results of the winter concentrated stage, and achieve the goal of effectively eliminating illiteracy before the autumn of next year. Be sure to open a class and run it well, and enroll a student to eliminate illiteracy on time.

III. Most areas, villages, and townships that do not yet have the conditions to run quick literacy classes should organize the vast number of farmers to attend winter literacy classes, using the past experience and teaching methods of running winter literacy classes to carry out mass cultural and political education. We should neither spread quick literacy teaching in an all-round way to avoid blindness, nor should we stop running winter literacy classes in order to carry out quick literacy in key areas, leaving the learning of the vast number of farmers aside and ignoring it. If the masses request to participate in quick literacy learning, the leaders should patiently persuade the masses, explain the characteristics of quick literacy with concentrated learning, and that due to the fact that teachers and teaching materials are not yet complete, this method cannot be fully promoted for the time being, and they should use the previous teaching methods to learn culture and politics.

IV. Winter literacy classes should be combined with the central work of various places to widely carry out political education. The content of political education: (1) Current affairs and political education. Widely publicize the great achievements of the past three years since the founding of the country, the great victory of resisting US aggression and aiding Korea, Sino-Soviet friendship, and the achievements of the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference, etc., to enhance the people's enthusiasm and confidence in loving the motherland and building the motherland. (2) Policy education. Conduct education on patriotic production increase, production cooperation, mutual aid in labor, the alliance of workers and peasants, and the socialist future. It can be combined with production models, model mutual aid groups and cooperatives, as well as typical Soviet examples for teaching. In addition, patriotic health education, Marriage Law publicity, and militia education should also be carried out. In areas where land reform is being carried out, policy education related to land reform should be carried out in conjunction with land reform. Political teaching materials are the responsibility of the major administrative regions to solve.

V. Winter literacy class funding. In addition to the subsidies already issued by the government, with the voluntary principle of the masses, approved by the village people's congress and approved by the county people's government, the masses may appropriately bear a portion.

    中央人民政府教育部关于一九五二年冬学运动的通知
    今年九月间，全国扫除文盲工作座谈会对于今年冬学运动已有所讨论。据最近各地进行情况看来，有的地区感到方针不够明确；有的地区尚未切实布置。特再发此通知，盼各地结合当地情况进行讨论与布置。
    一、速成识字法的创造，为扫除文盲工作提供了有效的方法。实验的结果证明：突击速成，确实有效，推行这种方法，确能加速提高农民文化政治水平的过程，因而也将推进国家建设事业。但速成后，必须继续进行巩固工作。否则大量“回生”，仍不能达到扫除文盲的目的。今冬明春农村工作任务仍很繁重，加以准备工作还不充分，因之全国范围内的扫除文盲运动，在今冬和明年应采取准备干部、重点试办的方针。尚不宜也不能普遍推行。而今年冬季广大农村则仍应开展冬学运动，按照以往经验对农民群众进行识字教育，并结合当地中心工作进行时事、政策教育和思想教育。
    二、推行速成识字教学，必须做好训练师资和教材等必要的准备工作，选择有条件的地区、村、乡有重点地推行。切忌毫无准备地全面铺开，使工作不巩固，为今后运动的开展造成极大困难。因此，必须以原有民校为基础，选择重点，吸收青壮年民校学员或略识文字的半文盲组成速成识字班进行教学，其目的在于积极地创造与积累农村推行速成识字法的经验，为今后全国大规模的农村扫除文盲运动取得系统的切实可行的经验并做好组织准备。因此，领导上不应单纯地追求数量，更重要的是求得扫除文盲的实际效果。在重点推行的地区与学校，必须加强领导，不断改进教师的教学方法，抓紧冬季农闲时间，减少其他活动，集中力量，在今冬明春完成突击速成识字的教学任务，以便冬学结束后转入巩固阶段，在常年民校中继续学习，巩固冬季突击阶段的学习成果，在明年秋季以前达到切实扫除文盲的目的。务必做到开一个班，就办好一个班，吸收一个学员入学，就按时扫除一个文盲。
    三、还没有条件开办速成识字班的大部分地区和村、乡，应组织广大农民上冬学，用以往办冬学的经验和教学方法，进行群众的文化与政治教育。既不应全面铺开速成识字教学，以免盲目自流，也不应为了搞重点地区的速成识字而停办冬学，把广大农民群众的学习放在一边不闻不问。如果群众要求参加速成识字学习，领导上应耐心说服群众，讲明速成识字集中突击的特点，目前因师资教材等条件还不齐备，暂时还不能全面推行这个办法，应用以往教学方法学习文化和政治。
    四、冬学应结合各地中心工作，广泛地开展政治教育。政治教育的内容：（一）时事政治教育。广泛宣传建国三年来的伟大成就、抗美援朝的伟大胜利、中苏友好、亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的成就等，以提高人民热爱祖国与建设祖国的积极性与信心。（二）政策教育。进行爱国增产、生产合作、劳动互助、工农联盟及社会主义的前途的教育。可结合生产模范、模范互助组和合作社以及苏联典型事例进行教学。此外，亦应进行爱国卫生教育、婚姻法宣传和民兵教育。在进行土地改革的地区，则应配合土地改革进行有关土地改革的政策教育。政治教材由各大行政区负责解决。
    五、冬学经费。除政府已发之补助费外，在群众自愿的原则下，经过村人民代表会通过，县人民政府批准，得适当地由群众负担一部分。
