Strive to Learn from the Soviet Union and Accelerate the Construction of the Motherland
Liu Ningyi, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions

Today, the conscious working people and all the oppressed people of the world are joyfully celebrating the 35th anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution in the Soviet Union. This fully demonstrates that "the October Revolution is not just a revolution 'within national boundaries.' It is first and foremost an international and global revolution because it represents a fundamental shift in the history of all mankind, from the old capitalist world to the new socialist world." (Stalin: On the International Character of the October Revolution). The light of the October Revolution illuminates the world and opens up the road to liberation for all people. At the same time, the victory of socialist construction in the Soviet Union has inspired the confidence of the working class around the world in striving for revolutionary victory.

The Chinese working class clearly understands that the victory of the Chinese revolution is inseparable from the victory of the Soviet October Revolution and the consolidation and strength of the Soviet Union. Chairman Mao taught us: "In the era of imperialism, any genuine people's revolution in any country cannot achieve its own victory without the assistance of international revolutionary forces in various forms. Even if it succeeds, it cannot be consolidated." (Chairman Mao: On People's Democratic Dictatorship). We, the Chinese working class, deeply understand this truth through our long revolutionary struggle and the practice of economic construction over the past three years. Let us recall the assistance the Soviet Union has given us in the past three years!

When the Chinese people overthrew the dark rule of imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries and seized power, the Soviet Union was the first to establish diplomatic relations with our country and signed the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance with great historical significance in February 1950. This further consolidated the friendship between China and the Soviet Union, strengthened our country's security, ensured the smooth progress of our country's construction, and also guaranteed peace in the Far East and the world. The Soviet government provided our country with loans on preferential terms and, at our invitation, sent a large number of experts to our country to help us with construction. Their high spirit of internationalism and sincere and selfless assistance played a significant role in the rapid recovery and development of our economy. Soviet railway experts worked tirelessly to help us build bridges and roads, enabling the rapid opening of traffic on the Jinghan and Yuehan lines after liberation and the rapid completion of the Chengdu-Chongqing and Tianshui-Lanzhou railways. Soviet water conservancy construction experts gave great assistance to our Huai River harnessing project and the Jingjiang flood diversion and other water conservancy projects, and enabled us to quickly complete the construction project of Tanggu New Port. In other areas, such as medicine, the Soviet anti-epidemic team braved dangers to help us eradicate the plague and protect the lives of tens of millions of Chinese people. These moving deeds are too numerous to mention.

After the Chinese working class led the people of the whole country to seize power, it followed the path of Marxism-Leninism throughout the three years of economic recovery and development. The conscious Chinese workers deeply realize the truth that "Communism is the higher productivity of labor – compared with that of capitalism – voluntarily, consciously and jointly achieved by workers who use advanced techniques.” (Lenin – The Great Beginning). After liberation, the working class across the country launched patriotic labor competitions and the movement to increase production and practice economy with the attitude of masters of the country, and the scale became larger and larger, and the number of participants became more and more numerous. In 1950, more than 680,000 people participated in labor competitions; in 1951, there were more than 2.2 million people. By 1952, more than 80 percent of employees nationwide had participated in the patriotic movement to increase production and practice economy. They highly demonstrated the enthusiasm and creativity of the working class and greatly improved labor productivity. This is a great achievement gained by learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union.

The spread of the Soviet Union's advanced experience and advanced technology in industrial production in China has led to a series of reforms in China's industrial production, which has greatly improved production efficiency. Over the past three years, the Chinese working class has made great achievements in learning from the Soviet Union's advanced experience and advanced technology. The Kovalev method has not only been successfully promoted in factories and mines across the country, but also effectively implemented in some non-direct production units and agricultural units. The "Hao Jianxiu Work Method" and the "1951 Weaving Method," which are famous in the textile industry, were summarized under the inspiration of the Kovalev advanced work method. The famous labor model Jiang Wanshou once used this work method to create the "Summer Uniform Operation Method." In the machine manufacturing industry, the promotion of high-speed cutting and multi-tool multi-blade cutting methods has doubled to thirty times the efficiency of our machine tools. In the railway sector, we creatively learned from the Soviet Union's advanced experience of 500-day vehicle kilometers and launched a full-load, over-axle, 500-kilometer movement across the country. The Li Xikui shunting team created the Li Xikui shunting method by adopting the advanced experience of the Soviet Union. In addition, we also learned the Nefedov road maintenance method and the water softening method. The implementation of these advanced production methods has brought the railway's production increase and economy movement to a new climax. In the coal mining industry, we have also learned from the Soviet Union's new coal mining methods and mine safety methods. In the power industry, we are starting to promote the Soviet rapid maintenance method. Tangshan Power Plant once used this method to create a new national record for rapid maintenance. In several industries, we have begun to vigorously promote the advanced scientific management method of "organizing rhythmic production according to instruction charts" and have achieved great results, overcoming imbalances in production and providing a strong guarantee for completing and exceeding the production increase and economy plan. Now, the movement to learn from the advanced experience and advanced technology of the Soviet Union has been generally valued by the working class in our country and has become an important key to carrying out production increase and economy competitions and completing and exceeding production plans. Under the patient guidance and assistance of Soviet experts, a large number of industrial technical talents and management leaders have emerged in various economic construction departments in our country.

Due to the sincere and selfless economic and technological assistance of the Soviet Union, our country has been able to achieve brilliant victories in all aspects of economic construction in just three years. This year, our country's industrial and agricultural production has exceeded the highest pre-war level, the country's financial and economic situation has fundamentally improved, and the living standards of workers have been considerably improved, which has prepared sufficient material conditions for large-scale economic construction.

When celebrating the 35th anniversary of the October Socialist Revolution, the working class of our country wholeheartedly thanks the October Socialist Revolution for pointing out the road to liberation for the Chinese working class, thanks the Soviet government and people for their deep friendship and valuable assistance to the people of our country, thanks Marshal Stalin for his concern and help to the Chinese people, and thanks the Soviet experts for their warm and selfless assistance to us. This assistance is something the Chinese working class will never forget.

Today, on the occasion of commemorating the 35th anniversary of the Soviet October Socialist Revolution, we see that the strength of the peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union is growing stronger. Under the shining light of the victory of the October Socialist Revolution, the peace-loving people of the world will achieve greater victories. The recent successful convening of the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the successful conclusion of the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference, and the great achievements of the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries in their peaceful construction all show that the cause of peace will surely win, and the warmongers headed by US imperialism will surely fail!

    努力向苏联学习，加紧祖国的建设
    中华全国总工会副主席  刘宁一
    现在，全世界觉悟的劳动人民和一切被压迫的人们都在欢欣鼓舞地庆祝苏联伟大的十月社会主义革命三十五周年纪念日。这充分地证明“十月革命并不是单只‘民族范围内的’革命。它首先就是国际性世界性的革命，因为它是全世界人类史中由资本主义旧世界进到社会主义新世界的根本转变。”（斯大林：论十月革命的国际性质）十月革命的光辉照亮了全世界，为全世界人民开辟了解放的道路。同时苏联社会主义建设的胜利也鼓舞了全世界工人阶级争取革命胜利的信心。
    中国工人阶级清楚地知道：中国革命的胜利是与苏联十月革命的胜利，与苏联的巩固和强大分不开的。毛主席教导我们说：“在帝国主义存在的时代，任何国家的真正的人民革命，如果没有国际革命力量在各种不同方式上的援助，要取得自己的胜利是不可能的。胜利了，要巩固，也是不可能的。”（毛主席：论人民民主专政）我们中国工人阶级，在长期革命斗争中，在三年来的经济建设实践中，深深地认识这个道理。让我们回忆一下三年来苏联对于我们的援助吧！
    当中国人民推翻了帝国主义和国民党反动派的黑暗统治而取得政权之后，苏联首先与我国建立了外交关系，并于一九五○年二月与我国缔结了具有伟大历史意义的中苏友好同盟互助条约。这就更加巩固了中苏两国之间的友谊，增强了我国的安全，保障了我国建设的顺利进行，同时也保障了远东与世界的和平。苏联政府以优惠的条件给我国贷款，并应我方的邀请派遣大批专家到我国来帮助我们进行建设。他们的高度国际主义的精神和真诚无私的帮助，对于我国经济的迅速恢复和发展，起了重大的作用。苏联的铁路专家曾不辞辛苦地帮助我们修桥铺路，使京汉、粤汉等路线在解放之后迅速通车，并使成渝、天兰铁路迅速建成。苏联水利建设专家给予我们的治淮工程及荆江分洪等水利工程以很大的帮助，并使我们很快完成了塘沽新港的建设工程。在其他方面，如在医药方面，苏联防疫队曾不避艰险地帮助我们扑灭鼠疫，保护千万个中国人民的生命。这些感人的事迹是不胜列举的。
    中国工人阶级在领导全国人民取得政权之后，在经济恢复与发展的整个三年中，是按照马克思—列宁主义的道路走的。觉悟的中国工人深深地认识到“共产主义就是利用先进技术的那些自愿、自觉、联合的工人所创造出来的、较资本主义更高的劳动生产率”（列宁—伟大的创举）这一真理。在解放后，全国工人阶级以主人翁的态度开展了爱国主义劳动竞赛和增产节约运动，而且规模愈来愈大，参加的人数愈来愈多。一九五○年参加劳动竞赛的有六十八万多人；一九五一年就有二百二十多万人。到一九五二年全国参加爱国增产节约运动的职工达百分之八十以上。他们高度地发挥了工人阶级的积极性和创造性，大大地提高了劳动生产率。这是由于学习苏联的先进经验而获得的伟大成就。
    苏联工业生产先进经验和先进技术在中国的传播，引起了中国工业生产上一系列的改革，使生产效率大大提高。三年来，中国工人阶级学习苏联先进经验和先进技术已有很大的成就。郭瓦廖夫工作方法，不仅已在全国厂矿中推行成功，而且在若干非直接生产单位和农业单位中，也行之有效。在纺织工业中闻名的“郝建秀工作法”和“一九五一织布工作法”就是在郭瓦廖夫先进工作方法的启示下总结出来的。著名的劳动模范姜万寿曾运用了这个工作方法，创造了“夏服统一操作法”。机器制造业中，高速切削和多刀多刃切削法的推行，使我国机床的效能提高了一倍至三十倍。在铁路方面，我们创造性地学习了苏联五百日车公里的先进经验，在全国范围内，展开了满载、超轴、五百公里运动。李锡奎调车组因采用苏联先进经验，创造了李锡奎调车法。此外，我们还学习了聂菲铎夫养路法、软水法等。这些先进生产方法的推行，把铁路的增产节约运动引上了一个新的高潮。在煤矿工业中，我们也学习了苏联新式采煤法和矿坑保安方法。在电业中，我们正开始推行苏联的快速检修法。唐山发电厂曾运用这一方法，创造了全国快速检修的新纪录。在几个产业中，我们开始大力推行“按指示图表组织有节奏生产”的先进科学管理方法，并取得了很大成绩，克服了生产中的不平衡现象，给完成与超过增产节约计划提供了有力保证。现在，学习苏联先进经验和先进技术的运动，已受到我国工人阶级的普遍重视，成为开展增产节约竞赛、完成和超过生产计划的重要关键。在苏联专家的耐心指导和帮助下，大量的工业技术人才和经营管理的领导干部在我国各经济建设部门涌现出来了。
    由于苏联这些经济和技术上的真诚无私的帮助，我国才有可能在短短的三年中，在经济建设的各个方面都获得了辉煌的胜利。今年，我国的工、农业生产已超过战前最高水平，国家财政经济状况已根本好转，工人的生活水平已有相当的提高，这就为大规模的经济建设准备了充分的物质条件。
    我们全国工人阶级在庆祝十月社会主义革命三十五周年的时候，都衷心地感谢十月社会主义革命的胜利给中国工人阶级所指出的解放道路，感谢苏联政府和人民给予我国人民的深情厚谊和可贵的援助，感谢斯大林大元帅对中国人民的关怀和帮助，感谢苏联专家给我们热诚无私的帮助。这种帮助是中国工人阶级永远不能忘记的。
    在纪念苏联十月社会主义革命三十五周年的今天，我们看到以苏联为首的和平民主阵营的力量日益壮大。在十月社会主义革命胜利光辉昭示之下，全世界爱好和平的人民将取得更大的胜利。最近苏联共产党十九次代表大会的胜利召开，亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的圆满成功，苏联及人民民主国家和平建设事业的巨大成就，都表明和平事业必将胜利，以美帝国主义为首的战争贩子们必将失败！
