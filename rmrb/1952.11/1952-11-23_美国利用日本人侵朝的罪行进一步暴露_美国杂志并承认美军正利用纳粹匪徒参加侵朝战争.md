Xinhua News Agency, November 19th, Tokyo Dispatch: The US government's crimes in using Japanese people to participate in the war in Korea have been further exposed.

Due to intense public opposition, Agence France-Presse (AFP) quoted Japanese official sources on the 17th as saying: The Japanese Yoshida government has asked the US authorities to note that since the start of the Korean War in June 1950, "it is reported that some Japanese have died, been captured, or gone missing in Korea."

According to AFP, the families of the Japanese who were sent to Korea as cannon fodder have filed compensation claims with the "United Nations Command" headquarters. The incident of the United States using Japanese to participate in the war in Korea has also caused "commotion" in Japanese public opinion. The "Mainichi Shimbun" published a dispatch from Tokushima, Shikoku on the 16th, stating that a Japanese prisoner of war, Tsutsui Kiyoto (transliteration), from northern Korea wrote a letter to his mother in Shikoku on August 15th of this year. The dispatch also said that Tsutsui Kiyoto, 23 years old, went to Korea with the US military on July 25, 1950.

At the beginning of launching the war of aggression against Korea, the US government recruited a large number of Japanese soldiers to participate in the war, some of whom have been captured by the Korean and Chinese People's Armies. According to Yasui Tatsufumi, a Japanese soldier captured by the Chinese People's Volunteers in the Changdan area of the Imjin River front in Korea on September 4th last year, he landed in Incheon on September 29, 1950, along with many other Japanese soldiers. As far as he knew, they were the third group of Japanese soldiers transported to Korea by the US military, with the first two groups totaling more than 2,000 people. Recently, Japanese newspapers have also revealed that 1,000 members of the Japanese "Police Reserve Force" originally stationed in Soumagahara, Gunma Prefecture, Japan, were sent to the Korean front line on July 20th of this year. Even a broadcast by CBS on September 27th believed that it was not true that the "United Nations" Command Headquarters in Tokyo said that there was no unit called the "Tokyo Volunteer Army." The company's reporters in Busan and Suwon confirmed that a "ghost unit composed of forgotten people" from Japan "is fighting side by side with the United Nations forces in Korea." This army numbers "as many as 8,000." It is called the "Student Volunteer Army Tokyo Team" in Suwon and the "Tokyo Volunteer Army" in Busan, and everyone has an "identity card" with the words "Volunteer soldier from Japan" written on it. Although the CBS broadcast still tried to cover up and describe these Japanese soldiers as "Koreans who grew up, were educated, and trained in Japan," the broadcast contradicted itself by saying, "No one knows what their legal nationality is." The fact is obvious that the so-called "Volunteer Army from Japan" is precisely the Japanese cannon fodder force. The captured Japanese soldier Yasui Tatsufumi carried two "documents" manufactured by the US, Japanese, and Rhee reactionaries to conceal his nationality: one was the No. 51027 "Alien Registration Certificate" issued by Shozo Shiokawa, the mayor of Fuse City, Osaka Prefecture, Japan, and the other was the "Republic of Korea National Registration Certificate" issued by the so-called "Republic of Korea Representative Office in Japan." He also confessed that the officials who issued the certificates warned them at the time: after arriving in Korea, they were not allowed to reveal that they were Japanese.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, November 22nd: The American "Collier's" magazine recently admitted that the American aggressor army is using Nazi bandits and so-called "international refugees" to participate in the war in Korea. This is another criminal act of the American authorities in the war of aggression against Korea. According to "Collier's" magazine in its October 25th issue, the First Marine Division of the US invading army fighting near the Panmunjom Neutral Zone has a reconnaissance company in which 20 to 40 percent of the officers and soldiers are so-called former "international refugees," including former German Nazi army tank drivers, former Nazi air force gunners, former "German army intelligence personnel," and "refugees from Franco Spain," etc. The mission of this reconnaissance company is to "obtain intelligence."

### 美国利用日本人侵朝的罪行进一步暴露  美国杂志并承认美军正利用纳粹匪徒参加侵朝战争

    美国利用日本人侵朝的罪行进一步暴露
    美国杂志并承认美军正利用纳粹匪徒参加侵朝战争
    【新华社十九日讯】东京消息：美国政府利用日本人参加侵朝战争的罪行，已经进一步暴露出来了。
    由于人民的激烈反对，法新社十七日引日本官方透露的消息说：日本吉田政府已提请美国当局注意，自从一九五○年六月朝鲜战争开始以来，“据传已有一些日本人在朝鲜阵亡、被俘或失踪”。
    据法新社讯，被派往朝鲜充当炮灰的日本人的家属已向“联合国军”总司令部提出赔偿要求。美国利用日本人参加侵朝战争的事件并且引起了日本舆论的“骚动”。“每日新闻”在十六日刊载了来自四国的德岛的一篇通讯说：在朝鲜北部的一个日本战俘筒井清人（译音）曾在今年八月十五日给他住在四国的母亲写了一封信。这篇通讯又说：筒井清人今年二十三岁，是在一九五○年七月二十五日随同美军前往朝鲜的。
    美国政府在发动侵朝战争之初，就募集了大量日本士兵参加战争，其中有一部分已被朝中人民军队俘掳。据去年九月四日在朝鲜临津江前线长湍地区被中国人民志愿军俘获的日本兵安井龙文供称，他是在一九五○年九月二十九日和其他许多日本兵在仁川登陆的。仅据他所知，他们是被美军运到朝鲜的第三批日本兵，前两批共有两千多人。最近日本报纸并揭露，原来驻在日本群马县相马原的日本
    “警察后备队”一千人，已于今年七月二十日被派往朝鲜前线。甚至美国哥伦比亚广播公司九月二十七日的广播都认为：东京“联合国”军总司令部说没有一支叫做“东京志愿军”的部队存在，这是不符合事实的。该公司在釜山和水原的记者证实：一支来自日本的“被遗忘的人组成的幽灵部队”“正在朝鲜与联合国军并肩作战”，这支军队的人数“多达八千”。它在水原叫做“学生志愿军东京队”，在釜山叫做“东京志愿军”，每个人身上都备有“身份证”，上面写着“来自日本的志愿兵”。尽管哥伦比亚广播公司的广播还遮遮掩掩地想把这些日本士兵说成为“在日本生长、受教育、受训练的朝鲜人”，但是，广播却又自相矛盾地说，“他们的法律国籍是什么，没有人知道。”事实很明显，所谓“来自日本的志愿军”正是日本炮灰部队。被俘的日本兵安井龙文就曾携带两张美、日、李反动派制造用来掩盖他的国籍的“证件”：一张是日本大阪府布施市市长盐川正三签发的第五一○二七号“外国人登陆证明书”，另一张是所谓“大韩民国驻日代表部”签发的“大韩民国国民登陆证”。他并供认：颁发证件的官员在当时曾警告他们：到朝鲜以后，不准暴露自己是日本人。
    【新华社平壤二十二日电】美国“柯里尔”杂志最近承认，美国侵略军正利用纳粹匪徒和所谓“国际难民”参加侵朝战争，这是美国当局在侵朝战争中的又一犯罪行为。据“柯里尔”杂志在十月二十五日出版的一期中说：在板门店中立区附近作战的美国海军陆战队第一师有一个侦察连，在该连的官兵中有百分之二十到四十的所谓前“国际难民”，其中包括前德国纳粹军队的坦克手、前纳粹空军的炮手、前“德国陆军谍报部门的人员”和“来自佛朗哥西班牙的难民”等等，这个侦察连的任务是“获取情报”。
