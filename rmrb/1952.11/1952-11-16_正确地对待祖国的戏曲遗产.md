Correctly Treat the Motherland's Operatic Heritage

The First National Opera Observation and Performance Conference, sponsored by the Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government, lasted for more than a month and successfully concluded on the 14th of this month. The conference exhibited many excellent programs of twenty-three kinds of operas popular among the people across the country, allowing various operas to engage in friendly competition and providing opera workers from various regions with opportunities for mutual observation and learning. The conference conducted awards for outstanding plays and outstanding actors, and reviewed the implementation of the central government's opera reform policies in various regions over the past three years. The gains of this conference will have a significant promoting effect on future opera reform work.

This opera observation and performance conference further proved the richness of our country's operatic heritage. The vast majority of our opera art was created by the people and has a long and close relationship with the people, possessing a strong popular and realistic spirit. Many excellent traditional plays performed at the conference demonstrated the lives and struggles, thoughts, feelings, wishes, and demands of the people under the heavy pressure of the feudal system; and adopted artistic forms that the people loved to see and hear. This is its popular nature (democratic nature). In terms of artistic methods, they are often closely integrated with life, adept at grasping the contradictions and conflicts in life, and the depiction of the human conditions of feudal society often reaches an unusually detailed and accurate degree; at the same time, they adopt very concise techniques and reasonable artistic exaggeration to vividly express the industrious, brave, intelligent, and kind character of the working people of our country, reflecting, directly or indirectly, the irreconcilable contradictions between the oppressed people and the oppressors. The ancient people created such a rich operatic heritage and excellent artistic traditions, and to this day they still exist and develop among the broad masses of the people, and are loved by the masses. This is something we should pay great attention to. However, old opera was ultimately formed in feudal society, and many of them were mixed with feudal and non-realistic elements; there are also many backward parts of opera's performing arts that need to be reformed. And how opera art can correctly and truthfully reflect modern life is an urgent problem to be solved. Therefore, we must treat our operatic heritage with a correct attitude. On the one hand, we should sort out and inherit the excellent traditional plays and excellent performing arts; on the other hand, we must make great efforts to organize playwrights, poets, and musicians, based on the principle of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, weed through the old to bring forth the new" proposed by Chairman Mao, to create new operas that are loved by the people and have stronger expressive power on the basis of national opera. Doing so is in line with the interests and demands of the broad masses of the people.

In the past three years, opera reform work has achieved many results. With the efforts of cultural leading organs at all levels and opera workers across the country, the feudal content and some bad performance methods of old opera are being gradually eliminated, and the face of the opera stage has undergone new changes. Judging from the achievements shown by this opera observation and performance conference, the opera types that have a greater impact on the masses in various regions across the country have generally received support and development, the work of sorting out traditional excellent plays has achieved preliminary results, and some local operas have made great efforts in expressing modern life themes. All of these are the results achieved by opera workers across the country who correctly treat heritage, treat tradition, and use correct methods to carry out reform work, and should be affirmed.

However, in the past three years, the central government, the major administrative regions, and the responsible departments of cultural work in various provinces have not seriously and deeply conveyed the central government's opera reform policies, and have not conducted serious and regular education for opera work cadres in various regions. Until now, the implementation of the central government's opera reform policies in various regions is very unsatisfactory. The serious shortcomings in the current opera reform work in various regions are mainly manifested in two erroneous attitudes towards operatic heritage: one is treating heritage with a rude attitude, and the other is taking a conservative attitude in artistic reform. These two erroneous attitudes are the main obstacles to the forward development of opera reform work and must be resolutely opposed.

Among the opera work cadres in various regions, there are many excellent workers who have achieved success by relying on the close cooperation of local artists and treating heritage with a correct attitude. However, there are also many opera work cadres who do not improve their policy level, ideological level, and artistic cultivation for a long time, and often treat operatic heritage with an intolerable rude attitude. They have no understanding of the excellent traditions of national opera, or the strong popular and realistic spirit in national opera; on the contrary, they often use the excuse that it contains feudalism to deny it altogether, and even openly violate the "Instructions on Opera Reform Work" of the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government, and arbitrarily adopt prohibition and various disguised prohibition methods without any request for instructions, causing difficulties in the lives of artists and arousing dissatisfaction among the masses. When revising or adapting scripts, they do not engage in close cooperation and careful work with the artists, but instead rely on subjective half-knowledge, and take reckless attitudes towards historical stories and folk legends that have been circulating among the masses for a long time, arbitrarily tampering with them, thus often making anti-historical and anti-artistic mistakes, destroying historical truth and artistic integrity. While rudely destroying the operatic art heritage of the motherland, they also often treat artists with a rude bureaucratic attitude; they do not regard opera artists as a part of the working people, as preservers and inheritors of the operatic art heritage of the motherland; they also completely ignore the significant improvement of the political consciousness and patriotic enthusiasm of opera artists across the country in the past three years, but simply emphasize their backward side, and do not sincerely and patiently help them to progress, but instead adopt a contemptuous attitude towards them, and even oppress them like the old rulers. When this opera observation and performance conference reviewed the opera reform work in various regions, artists from various regions exposed the above-mentioned unreasonable phenomena. It is entirely necessary for the Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government to earnestly handle and correct them.

On the other hand, the conservative attitude of sticking to the old ways in opera reform is also what we oppose. The emergence of this conservative attitude is due to a lack of understanding that many parts of old opera have feudal and backward qualities in terms of ideology and artistic form, and must undergo appropriate reforms in order to maintain fresh and vigorous life in the new society and adapt to the requirements of today's people. In the past three years, the leading organs of opera reform in various regions have not done enough in the work of reviewing and sorting out old opera programs and organizing the creation of new scripts, and thus have failed to change the chaotic phenomenon of programs being performed in various regions in a timely manner. This is an urgent problem to be solved in the current opera reform work. In the reform of opera art, in addition to continuing to eliminate ugly stage images and striving to improve performing arts, the reform of music is of particularly important significance. Our country's opera music has a distinct popular and national style, which is valuable; however, it is generally relatively monotonous and its expressive power is not rich enough, which is an aspect that must be improved.

Having local opera or folk opera express modern life and the themes of the people's current struggles is an important task in opera reform work. Judging from the achievements of this observation and performance, it is entirely possible for local opera to express modern life themes, and it has already achieved preliminary results. The main shortcoming of the current opera creation reflecting modern life is that there is a fairly widespread tendency towards conceptualization. Those works are often not objective and truthful reflections, but contain many subjective fabrications; they do not focus on portraying characters, but instead recite ready-made lessons in a tasteless manner, and therefore lack the power to move people. To change this situation, opera creators need to strengthen their ideological training and life experience, and earnestly learn from the advantages and characteristics of realistic methods in traditional opera; creative leading organizations at all levels need to earnestly lead the creation of modern themes to ensure the gradual improvement of the quality of new opera.

Opera reform work must be smoothly carried out with the care and assistance of the entire literary and artistic community. Experts in the literary, drama, and music fields should cooperate closely with the broad masses of artists in the future, actively participate in opera reform work, and promote our country's national opera to a new stage of prosperity.

### 正确地对待祖国的戏曲遗产

    正确地对待祖国的戏曲遗产
    中央人民政府文化部主办的第一届全国戏曲观摩演出大会，历时月余，已于本月十四日圆满闭幕。大会展览了全国各地在群众中流行的二十三种戏曲的许多优秀节目，使各种戏曲展开了友谊的竞赛，使各地戏曲工作者得到互相观摩学习的机会。大会对优秀剧目和优秀演员进行了评奖，并对三年来各地执行中央的戏曲改革政策的情况进行了检查。大会的这些收获，对今后的戏曲改革工作将有显著的推动作用。
    这次戏曲观摩演出大会，进一步证明了我国戏曲遗产的丰富。我们的戏曲艺术绝大部分是由人民所创造，和人民有悠久的密切的联系，具有强烈的人民性和现实主义精神。大会上演的许多传统的优秀剧目，表现了在封建制度重压下人民的生活和斗争，人民的思想、感情、愿望和要求；并且采取了人民喜闻乐见的艺术形式。这就是它的人民性（民主性）。而在艺术方法上它们经常是密切地结合生活，善于抓住生活中的矛盾和冲突，对封建社会的人情世态的描绘，往往达到异常细致准确的程度；同时采取十分简练的手法和合理的艺术夸张，生动地表现出我国劳动人民勤劳、勇敢、智慧、善良的性格，正面地或者曲折地反映了被压迫的人民和压迫者之间的不可调和的矛盾，这就是戏曲艺术传统中的现实主义精神。古代人民创造了这样丰富的戏曲遗产和优良的艺术传统，而且至今它们还在广大人民群众中生存着发展着，为群众所喜爱，这是值得我们十分重视的。但旧有戏曲究竟是在封建社会中形成的，其中许多曾搀杂了封建性和非现实主义的成份；戏曲的表演艺术也有许多落后的部分，有待于改革。而戏曲艺术如何正确地、真实地反映现代生活，更是当前急待解决的问题。因此，我们必须用正确的态度对待自己的戏曲遗产。一方面，应该把传统的优秀剧目和优秀的表演艺术加以整理而继承下来；另一方面必须用极大的努力，组织剧作家、诗人和音乐家，根据毛主席提出的“百花齐放，推陈出新”的方针，在民族戏曲的基础上创造为人民喜闻乐见的、表现力更强的新戏曲。这样做，是符合于广大人民的利益和要求的。
    三年来的戏曲改革工作已获得不少成绩。在各级文化领导机关和全国戏曲工作者的努力下，旧戏曲的封建内容和某些恶劣的表演方法都正在被逐步清除，戏曲舞台的面貌已发生新的变化。从这次戏曲观摩演出大会所显示的成绩看来，全国各地凡是在群众中影响较大的剧种已普遍得到扶持与发展，整理传统优秀剧目的工作已获得初步的成绩，某些地方戏曲在表现现代生活题材上也尽了很大的努力。所有这些，都是全国戏曲工作者正确地对待遗产、对待传统，运用正确的方法进行改革工作所获得的成果，是应该予以肯定的。
    但是在已往的三年中，中央、各大行政区、各省文化工作的主管部门，对中央的戏曲改革政策没有作认真的深入的传达，对各地戏曲工作干部没有进行认真的经常的教育，直到现在，中央的戏曲改革政策在各地的执行情况，是非常不能令人满意的。目前各地戏曲改革工作中的严重缺点，主要表现为对待戏曲遗产的两种错误态度：一种是以粗暴的态度对待遗产，一种是在艺术改革上采取了保守的态度。这两种错误态度是戏曲改革工作向前发展的主要障碍，必须坚决地加以反对。
    各地戏曲工作干部中有不少优秀的工作者，他们依靠当地艺人的通力合作，以正确的态度对待遗产，因而取得了成绩，但也有不少戏曲工作干部长时期不提高自己的政策水平、思想水平与文艺修养，经常以不可容忍的粗暴态度对待戏曲遗产。他们对民族戏曲的优良传统，对民族戏曲中强烈的人民性和现实主义精神毫不理解；相反地，往往借口其中含有封建性而一概加以否定，甚至公然违反中央人民政府政务院“关于戏曲改革工作的指示”，不经任何请示而随便采用禁演和各种变相禁演的办法，使艺人生活发生困难，引起群众的不满。他们在修改或改编剧本的时候，不是和艺人密切合作审慎从事，而是听凭主观的一知半解，对群众中流传已久的历史故事、民间传说，采取轻举妄动的态度，随意窜改，因而经常发生反历史主义和反艺术的错误，破坏了历史的真实和艺术的完整。他们在粗暴地破坏祖国戏曲艺术遗产的同时，也经常以粗暴的官僚主义态度对待艺人；他们不是把戏曲艺人当成劳动人民的一部分，当成祖国戏曲艺术遗产的保存者和继承者；对于全国戏曲艺人三年来政治觉悟与爱国热情的显著提高，也完全加以忽视，而单纯强调其落后的一面，不是诚恳地、耐心地帮助他们进步，而是对他们采取了轻视的态度，甚至像旧的统治者那样地压迫他们。这次戏曲观摩演出大会在检查各地戏曲改革工作情况的时候，各地艺人揭发了上述的不合理现象，中央人民政府文化部将切实加以处理和纠正，这是完全必要的。
    另一方面，戏曲改革中的固步自封的保守态度，也是我们所反对的。这种保守态度的产生，是由于不理解旧有戏曲有许多部分在思想上和艺术形式上的封建性和落后性，必须经过适当的改革，才能在新社会保持新鲜活泼的生命，适应今天的人民群众的要求。已往的三年中，各地戏曲改革的领导机关，对旧有戏曲节目的审定与整理工作以及组织新剧本创作的工作都做得十分不够，因而未能及时地改变各地上演节目的混乱现象。这是当前戏曲改革工作中亟待解决的问题。在戏曲艺术的改革上，除应继续澄清丑恶的舞台形象，并在表演艺术上力求改进外，音乐的改革具有特别重要的意义。我国戏曲音乐具有鲜明的人民性和民族风格，这是值得宝贵的；但是一般地比较单调，表现力不够丰富，这是必须改进的方面。
    地方戏曲或民间戏曲表现现代生活和当前的人民斗争题材，是戏曲改革工作中的重要的任务。从这次观摩演出的成绩看来，地方戏曲表现现代生活题材，是完全可能的，并已收到初步的成效。目前反映现代生活的戏曲创作的主要缺点，是相当普遍地存在着概念化的倾向。那些作品往往不是客观的真实反映，而包含很多主观的编造；不是集中地刻划人物，而是无味地背诵现成的教训，因此缺乏感动人的力量。要改变这种情况，需要戏曲创作者加强思想锻练与生活体验，认真地向传统戏曲中现实主义方法的优点和特点学习；需要各级创作领导机构，认真地领导现代题材的创作，以保证新戏曲质量的逐步提高。
    戏曲改革工作必须在整个文学艺术界的关心与协助之下，才能得到顺利的开展。文学界、戏剧界和音乐界的专家今后应该与广大艺人密切合作，积极参加戏曲改革工作，将我国民族戏曲推进到新的繁荣的阶段。
