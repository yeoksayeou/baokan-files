(Xinhua News Agency, November 28th) According to TASS, New York: The United Nations General Assembly's Political Committee held a meeting on the morning of November 26th to discuss Iran's suggestion to prioritize the study of the Indian proposal. Not a single representative from the US-British bloc could come up with any words to justify this illegal suggestion.

The head of the Soviet delegation, Vyshinsky, pointed out in his speech that those who made this suggestion, and those who tend to support it, are trying to circumvent discussing it, finding themselves unable to speak in favor of it. Vyshinsky said, "I think this is a sign that those who are trying to pass an illegal resolution have lowered their heads before the law."

On November 26th, newspapers reported that representatives of the twenty-one-nation delegation colluded to conspire to have the Indian proposal prioritized for discussion.

The Soviet delegation reiterated that the attempt to prioritize the Indian proposal is a blatant violation of the principle of democratic rights, a fundamental principle enshrined in the United Nations Charter, which is the foundation of all activities of our United Nations organization. The Iranian representative's suggestion to prioritize the Indian proposal must be rejected because it is illegal, violates the rules of procedure, and demonstrates the arrogance of the aggressive core of the North Atlantic bloc occupying a leadership position within the United Nations.

In response to the speech of the head of the Soviet delegation, the Iranian representative did not provide any reasons, simply insisting that his suggestion was "legal" and in accordance with the rules of procedure.

The head of the Czechoslovak delegation, Sekaninová, emphasized that the purpose of the Iranian suggestion is to create new difficulties in the work of the Political Committee. She said that the US-British bloc does not want to create conditions for reaching an agreement on a peaceful settlement of the Korean question.

Vyshinsky spoke again, pointing out that the Iranian representative's citation of the rules of procedure was absolutely unfounded, and emphasized that the Iranian suggestion actually grossly violated the rules of procedure.

The US-British bloc's voting machine passed the Iranian representative's illegal suggestion. The Soviet, Byelorussian, Ukrainian, Polish, and Czechoslovak delegations voted against it. The Political Committee then began discussing the Indian proposal.

Representatives from Chile, Peru, Norway, Iraq, and Sweden spoke in support of the Indian proposal, but they did not provide any sufficient reasons to support the proposal, but only praised the Indian delegation and its proposal. They proposed some amendments to the Indian proposal in accordance with the speeches of Acheson and Eden. The Iraqi representative reiterated his suggestion, advocating the inclusion of an Indian representative on the POW repatriation committee.

Although the Swedish representative also supported the Indian proposal, he said that the Swedish government did not consider itself bound by the repatriation plan conditions in the proposal.

None of the speakers mentioned the Soviet proposal for an immediate cessation of the Korean War.

Vyshinsky analyzed these speeches and explained the necessity of amending the Indian proposal according to the suggestions of the Soviet delegation; without such amendments, this proposal would not be of any use to the cause of peace.

    联大政委会非法通过优先讨论印度提案
    维辛斯基主张按照苏联建议修改印度提案
    【新华社二十八日讯】据塔斯社纽约讯：联合国大会政治委员会在十一月二十六日上午举行会议，讨论伊朗提出的优先研究印度提案的建议。美英集团里没有一个代表想得出任何话来为这个非法建议辩解。
    苏联代表团团长维辛斯基在发言时指出，提出这个建议的人以及那些倾向于支持这个建议的人，试图规避讨论这个建议，他们发觉无法发言支持这个建议。维辛斯基说：“我认为这是一个迹象，说明那些试图通过一个非法决议的人在法律面前低了头。”
    十一月二十六日，报纸报道说，二十一国代表团的代表串通一气，阴谋使印度提案优先讨论。
    苏联代表团再次声明，打算优先讨论印度提案的企图，是悍然违反在联合国宪章中列为基本原则的民主权利原则的行为，这种基本原则是我们联合国组织的全部活动的基础。伊朗代表提出的优先讨论印度提案的建议，必须予以拒绝，因为它是非法的，不合议事规则的，它说明了在联合国内占据领导地位的北大西洋集团侵略核心的专横态度。
    伊朗代表在回答苏联代表团团长的发言时，没有提出任何理由，只是硬说他的建议是“合法”而且符合议事规则的。
    捷克斯洛伐克代表团团长塞卡尼诺娃着重指出，伊朗建议目的在于在政治委员会的工作中制造新的困难。她说，美英集团不想创造条件，以便获致和平解决朝鲜问题的协议。
    维辛斯基再次发言，指出伊朗代表对议事规则的引证绝对没有根据，并着重说明伊朗建议实际上粗暴地破坏了议事规则。
    美英集团表决机器通过了伊朗代表的非法建议。苏联、白俄罗斯、乌克兰、波兰和捷克斯洛伐克代表团投票反对。政治委员会然后开始讨论印度提案。
    智利、秘鲁、挪威、伊拉克和瑞典的代表发言支持印度提案，但他们没有提出什么充足的理由来支持这个提案，而只是赞扬印度代表团和它的提案。他们按照艾奇逊和艾登的演说对印度提案提出了一些修正案。伊拉克代表重复他的建议，主张在遣返战俘委员会里加入一个印度代表。
    瑞典代表虽然也支持印度提案，但是说，瑞典政府不认为它受提案中遣返计划条件的约束。
    所有发言者都没有谈到苏联提出的立即停止朝鲜战争的建议。
    维辛斯基对于这些发言作了分析，并说明有必要按照苏联代表团的建议修改印度提案，没有这种修改，这个提案就不可能对和平事业有任何用处。
