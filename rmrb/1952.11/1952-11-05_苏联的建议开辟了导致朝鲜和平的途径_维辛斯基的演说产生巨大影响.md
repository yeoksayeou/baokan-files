Xinhua News Agency, November 3rd: Vyshinsky's forceful exposure in the Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly on October 29th of the fact that the U.S. government was obstructing Korean unification, launching a war of aggression against Korea, and sabotaging the armistice negotiations, as well as his proposal to establish a commission for the peaceful resolution of the Korean problem, has had a tremendous impact within the United Nations General Assembly.

Following Vyshinsky's proposal, U.S. Secretary of State Acheson hastily came out to say that Vyshinsky's proposal contained "nothing new." U.S. spokesmen at the United Nations also deceived other countries on October 30th by saying that if the Korean problem were handed over to the committee established by Vyshinsky's proposal, it "would mean negotiating from scratch."

But Vyshinsky's speech and proposal itself has already completely refuted these shameless slanders. Associated Press reporter Roberts admitted on October 31st that Vyshinsky's speech "has indeed become a very strong appeal regarding the Korean problem for the whole world." Roberts said that Vyshinsky's proposal "appears reasonable to many people (including the allies and neutral countries of the United States). It is expected that Asia, the Middle East and Latin America will give great support to this proposal." Therefore, Roberts said: "In fact, Secretary of State Acheson cannot insist on his original opposition." Reuters' United Nations dispatch on October 30th also reported that many United Nations representatives, after hearing Vyshinsky's proposal, said that the proposal "could prompt people to reconsider the Korean issue."

Vyshinsky's proposal opens a path that can truly lead to peace in Korea and greatly encourages other countries in the United Nations who hope for a Korean armistice. Associated Press reporter Roberts revealed that the neutral countries may unite to demand amendments to the U.S. proposal submitted on October 24th. Roberts admitted, "The American delegation has fallen into a situation of being surrounded on all sides."

Because Vyshinsky's proposal has already had a huge impact, the U.S.-British aggressor bloc is frantically plotting how to overturn Vyshinsky's proposal in order to continue driving other countries to pursue a policy of aggression. The U.S. government is simultaneously putting pressure on its "allies" to make them follow it. The Associated Press has already issued a warning to these "allies" saying: "The allies must not disgrace themselves in front of the neutral countries, and the United States must not disgrace itself in front of the other allies."

### 苏联的建议开辟了导致朝鲜和平的途径  维辛斯基的演说产生巨大影响

    苏联的建议开辟了导致朝鲜和平的途径
    维辛斯基的演说产生巨大影响
    【新华社三日讯】维辛斯基十月二十九日在联合国大会政治委员会上有力地揭露了美国政府阻挠朝鲜统一、发动侵朝战争和破坏停战谈判的事实，并提出设立和平解决朝鲜问题委员会的建议。维辛斯基的演说和建议，在联合国大会中产生了巨大的影响。
    在维辛斯基的建议提出以后，美国国务卿艾奇逊就赶紧出来说维辛斯基的建议“没有什么新鲜东西”。美国在联合国的发言人也在十月三十日欺骗其他国家说，如果把朝鲜问题交给维辛斯基建议成立的委员会来讨论，“会意味着从头进行谈判”。
    但是维辛斯基的演说和建议本身就已经完全驳斥了这些无耻的谰言。美联社记者罗伯茨十月三十一日承认，维辛斯基的演说“对于全世界说来的确已经成为关于朝鲜问题的一个极强烈的呼吁”。罗伯茨说，维辛斯基的建议“在很多人（包括美国的同盟国和中立国）看来都是合理的。可以预料，亚洲、中东和拉丁美洲方面会对这种建议予以很大的支持”。因此，罗伯茨说：“事实上，国务卿艾奇逊无法坚持他原来反对的意见。”路透社联合国十月三十日电也报道说：许多联合国代表在听了维辛斯基提出的建议以后说，这个建议“可以促使人们从新考虑朝鲜问题”。
    维辛斯基的建议开辟了真正能导致朝鲜和平的途径，大大鼓舞了联合国中希望朝鲜停战的其他国家。美联社记者罗伯茨透露，各中立国家可能联合起来，要求修正美国在十月二十四日提出的提案。罗伯茨承认，“美国代表团已经陷于四面包围的情况下了”。
    由于维辛斯基的建议已经产生了巨大的影响，美英侵略集团正在慌忙筹划如何推翻维辛斯基的建议，以便继续驱使其他国家来奉行侵略政策。美国政府同时正对它的“盟国”施用压力，要它们跟着它走。美联社已经向这些“盟国”发出警告说：“各盟国决不可在中立国家面前出丑，而美国也决不可在其他各盟国面前出丑。”
