The liberation of the Chinese people has given Chinese Buddhism the opportunity to cleanse itself of impurities and see the light again.

In the past three years, everything in the People's Republic of China is worthy of enthusiastic praise from Buddhists. We praise the achievements of economic reform in vast areas, which have freed Buddhists from the shackles of feudal economics and allowed them to resume a life of upholding precepts and striving diligently; we praise the victory in suppressing counter-revolutionaries, especially in outlawing reactionary secret societies, which has enabled Buddhists to distinguish between right and wrong, be vigilant against conspiracies, and protect the purity of religion; we praise the great movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea to protect our homes and defend our country, which has given Buddhists the special opportunity to repay the kindness of the country and the kindness of all living beings; we praise the increasingly practical and thorough protection of religious freedom; we praise the correct and perfect implementation of ethnic policies, which enables all ethnic brothers who believe in Buddhism to live in harmony and work together in this loving family to promote the Dharma and benefit all living beings. We praise all this; we thank the leaders of all this—our great leader Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government; at the same time, we congratulate ourselves, because Buddhists have also contributed a part of their strength to all these achievements.

In order to further exert our strength to welcome the large-scale construction that is about to begin in our country, and to continue to strengthen the movement to defend world peace, we feel the need for an organization to connect Buddhists across the country, and we believe that the conditions are ripe today.

Therefore, we are initiating the organization of the Chinese Buddhist Association to unite Buddhists under the leadership of the People's Government to participate in the movement to love the country and defend world peace, assist the government in implementing the policy of religious freedom, and connect with Buddhists in various places to cooperate in promoting the Dharma and benefiting all living beings. We held a founders' meeting in Beijing on November 5th, preparing to convene an establishment meeting at an appropriate time, inviting Buddhists from all walks of life to participate, and decided to set up a preparatory office first to be responsible for liaison and consultation with all parties and other related preparatory work.

We believe that our initiative will receive the sympathy and assistance of Buddhists in various places. We sincerely look forward to the guidance of all virtuous masters.

    中国佛教协会发起书
    中国人民的解放，给予了中国佛教以涤瑕荡垢，重见光明的机会。
    三年来，人民中国的一切，是值得佛教徒热情歌颂的。我们歌颂广大地区经济改革的成就，使佛教徒不再为封建经济所束缚，而得以恢复持戒精进的生活；我们歌颂镇压反革命，尤其是取缔反动会道门的胜利，使佛教徒得以分清邪正，警惕阴谋而护持宗教的纯洁；我们歌颂抗美援朝保家卫国的伟大运动，使佛教徒有了报国土恩报众生恩的殊胜因缘；我们歌颂宗教信仰自由之日益得到切实而周到的保护，我们歌颂民族政策之正确而完善的执行，使所有信仰佛教的各民族兄弟们都能够在这一友爱的大家庭中和衷共济，弘法利生。我们歌颂这一切；我们感谢这一切的领导者——我们伟大的领袖毛主席和中央人民政府；同时我们也引以自庆，因为佛教徒在这一切成就中，也贡献了一部分的力量。
    为了更进一步发挥我们的力量以迎接我国即将开始的大规模建设，和继续加强保卫世界和平运动，我们感觉到需要一个联系全国佛教徒的组织，而且我们认为在今天的因缘，已经成熟。
    因此，我们发起组织中国佛教协会，以团结佛教徒在人民政府领导下参加爱护祖国、保卫世界和平的运动，协助政府贯彻宗教信仰自由政策，并与各地佛教徒联系协进弘法利生事业。我们已于十一月五日在北京举行了发起人会议，准备在适当时期召开成立会，邀请各方面佛教人士参加，并决定先行设立筹备处负责与各方面联系协商及其他有关的筹备工作。
    我们相信我们的发起，将会得到各地佛教同人的同情和协助。我们诚恳地企盼着诸方大德的指教。
