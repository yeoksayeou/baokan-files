Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 16th:

    Paris Tonight reporter Pierre reported on the 15th: The US side conducted a ridiculous investigation yesterday into the so-called incident of a US soldier being killed in the 200-meter safety zone south of Panmunjom, along the Panmunjom-Munsan highway. The US side insisted that the soldier was killed by a bullet "used by the Korean-Chinese side." The Korean-Chinese investigation team, headed by Colonel Zhang Chunshan, went to the scene with the US investigation team, headed by Colonel McCassey, to conduct a joint investigation. However, it quickly became clear that the US side had no intention of conducting a genuine investigation. The only piece of evidence presented by McCassey was a bullet similar to the millions of bullets scattered along the front lines, and a bullet hole in a tent, where the soldier was said to have been hit. Colonel Zhang asked to see the body. McCassey replied, "The body has been buried." Where was the blood-stained clothing? McCassey replied, "It has been taken away." McCassey said the deceased lay on the ground for fifteen minutes before being carried away. Colonel Zhang asked to enter the tent to see the blood stains. McCassey replied, "There are no blood stains; the victim died of internal bleeding." A US Navy medical officer testified that the bullet passed through the chest, heart, and lungs, and exited through the skin of the back. Colonel Zhang said, "It is hard for soldiers to believe that a person who died from a bullet wound would not shed a single drop of blood." McCassey produced a map, saying it showed the path of the bullet, which ran from the location of the alleged deceased through a hole in the tent to the Korean-Chinese positions more than a mile away. Less than twenty steps behind the tent was a twenty-foot-high hill. If the bullet had entered the tent at the angle McCassey claimed, it would have hit the hill. Colonel Zhang wanted to go to the hill, but the US side told him that the hill was outside the area he was "permitted to investigate." Colonel Zhang protested that the hill was within the 200-meter safety zone, and it was impossible to investigate McCassey's claims without going there. (To the average person, this seems impossible unless bullets can turn corners.) McCassey still refused. The entire investigation team was surrounded by US Marines holding carbines. A Chinese photographer wanted to take a picture of the angle at which the bullet must have entered the tent, but was pushed off the platform by US military police. Colonel Zhang pointed out that in the many investigations conducted in the areas controlled by the Korean-Chinese side in the past, the US side enjoyed the fullest freedom of movement. They could go wherever they wanted, ask whoever they wanted, and all the physical evidence was left at the scene of the incident. McCassey did not allow anyone to go more than five steps away from the tent at the so-called scene of the incident. The only witness who claimed to have seen the incident was a US Marine who tried to recite memorized lines, but he stammered and could not speak clearly, so McCassey had to prompt him on every detail, including the name of the alleged deceased. When the investigation was completed, Colonel Zhang told McCassey that although there was a lack of conclusive physical evidence, he was still willing to continue the investigation based on the evidence the US side had presented, and then reply to McCassey. The Western news agencies' claim that the Korean-Chinese side had suspended the investigation is completely fabricated. No Western reporters were present when the liaison officers returned to Panmunjom for the final meeting on this incident. The following points of this incident are inexplicable: If the person the US side claimed was shot in the safety zone less than a mile from Panmunjom, why was the Korean-Chinese side not notified until more than thirty-six hours later? In contrast, the Korean-Chinese side notifies the US side within one or two hours of any incident occurring in the Kaesong area. Why was the body removed and buried so quickly? Why was the Korean-Chinese liaison officer not allowed to conduct even a minimum investigation? Why authorize Western news agencies to spread fabricated news about the Korean-Chinese side suspending the investigation? In fact, a review of the official record shows that the Korean-Chinese side is still investigating, and even the UN Command's official communique has not stated that the investigation has been suspended. All of this shows that the US side's propaganda methods are very clumsy.

    揭露美方诬我击毙中立区美兵的荒谬事件
    【新华社开城十六日电】巴黎今晚报记者贝却敌十五日报道：美方昨天对在板门店以南不到一哩、沿板门店汶山公路的二百公尺安全区内所谓有美军士兵一人被击毙的事件，进行了荒谬可笑的调查。美方硬说这个士兵是被“朝中方面所用的一种”子弹打死的。以张春山上校为首的朝中方面调查小组曾与以麦卡塞上校为首的美方调查小组赴现场共同进行调查。但是后来很快就可以看出，美方是无意进行真正调查的。麦卡塞所提出的唯一物证是一颗与散布在前线地区的千百万颗子弹相似的子弹，以及在帐篷上的一个子弹洞，据说这个士兵就是在这个帐篷中被击中的。张上校要求看看尸体。麦卡塞答道：“尸体已埋葬了”。血衣在哪里呢？麦卡塞答道：“已拿走了”。麦卡塞说，死者在地上躺了十五分钟后就被抬走。张上校要求进入帐篷中看看血迹。麦卡塞回答道：“没有血迹，受害者是因内脏流血而死的。”美方海军军医作证说，子弹从胸部穿过心、肺从背部皮肤出来。张上校说：“军人很难相信一个因中弹受伤而死的人会不流一滴血。”麦卡塞拿出一幅地图来，他说这幅地图显示了子弹所经的路线，这条路线从所说的那个死者所在的地方经过帐篷上的一个洞直到一哩多以外的朝中阵地。在帐篷后面不到二十步的地方，是一个二十呎高的山丘，如果子弹是以麦卡塞所说的角度打进帐篷的话，那么这颗子弹就一定会打到这个山丘上。张上校想要到这个山丘去，但美方告他说，这个山丘是在他“被准许进行调查”的地区以外。张上校抗议说，这个山丘是在二百公尺的安全区以内，不到那里去就无法调查麦卡塞的说法是否是可能的。（在普通人看来，这似乎是不可能的，除非子弹会拐弯。）麦卡塞仍予以拒绝。全部调查人员为持有卡宾枪的美国海军陆战队所包围。一个中国摄影记者想要把子弹进入帐篷所一定需要的角度拍下来，结果被美国军事警察从台子上推下来。张上校指出，过去在朝中控制的地区所进行的许多次调查中，美方享有最充分的行动自由，他们想到哪里去就可以到哪里去，想询问谁就可以询问谁，而且一切物证全都留在出事地点。麦卡塞不让任何人到离所谓出事地点的帐篷五步以外的任何地方去。唯一声称看到这个事件的证人是一位美国海军陆战队士兵，这个士兵企图背诵记熟的话，但他结结巴巴地说不出来，以致每个细节都要麦卡塞提示他，包括所说的死者的名字在内。当调查完毕时，张上校告诉麦卡塞说，虽然缺乏确凿的物证，但他仍愿根据美方所已提出的证据继续进行调查，然后答复麦卡塞。西方通讯社所报道的朝中方面中止进行调查的说法完全是捏造的。当联络官返回板门店就这个事件举行最后会议时，没有一个西方记者在场。这次事件有以下几点是无法解释的：如果美方所说的这个人是在离板门店不到一哩的安全区内被枪击的话，为什么在三十六个多钟头以后才通知朝中方面？而在开城地区所发生的任何事件，朝中方面都是在一两小时之内就通知美方了。为什么这样快就把尸体运走并埋葬起来？为什么连最低限度的调查也不让朝中联络官进行？为什么授意西方通讯社传布关于朝中方面中止进行调查的伪造的消息？事实上看看正式记录就可以看出，朝中方面仍在进行调查，而甚至联合国军正式公报也未说调查已经中止。这一切说明美方的宣传手段是很不高明的。
