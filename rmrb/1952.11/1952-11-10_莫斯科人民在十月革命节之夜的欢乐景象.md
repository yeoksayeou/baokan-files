Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, November 8th: According to TASS, Moscow, as dusk fell on November 7th, Moscow was already brightly lit. Colorful flags fluttered everywhere, and melodious songs echoed throughout. The working people joyfully celebrated the 35th anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution.

After the grand parade on Red Square, Moscow's various squares and thoroughfares were again filled with jubilant crowds. Muscovites flocked to Red Square, the site of the Kremlin, to view the magnificent lights on the various buildings. Gorky Street was particularly lively. People's attention was focused on the Central Telegraph Office building, where numerous electric lights were strung together to form various charts illustrating the goals for national economic development stipulated in the Soviet Union's new Five-Year Plan. Crowds of people also clustered around the newly built high-rise buildings. The new campus of Moscow State University—the Palace of Science on Lenin Hills—was bathed in the brilliance of 1,200 powerful arc lamps, which formed the words "Glory to Stalin!" In Smolensk Square, many buildings and newly completed buildings were also brightly decorated. Moscow is rapidly changing its appearance. In the ten years up to 1960, Moscow will construct housing with a floor area of ten million square meters. On the day of the October Revolution anniversary, the people of Moscow were very interested to see the architectural drawings displayed in the shop windows, which showed that Moscow's reconstruction plan was being successfully implemented.

The Moscow people's celebration activities began at 7:00 p.m. on twenty-two squares and streets. As the Kremlin chimes struck eight, celebratory salutes suddenly boomed. Multicolored fireworks painted a beautiful picture in the dark night sky. The jubilant crowds became even more excited.

On this day, celebratory salutes were also fired in the capitals of the Soviet Union's various republics, as well as in Kaliningrad, Lviv, Khabarovsk, Vladivostok, the heroic Leningrad and Stalingrad, Sevastopol, and Odessa.

    莫斯科人民在十月革命节之夜的欢乐景象
    【新华社八日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：十一月七日夜幕初降时分，莫斯科已灯火通明。彩色的旗帜到处飘扬，悠扬的歌声到处回响。劳动人民欢欣鼓舞地庆祝了伟大的十月社会主义革命三十五周年。
    在红场的盛大游行结束以后，莫斯科的各个广场和通衢大街上又挤满了狂欢的人群。莫斯科人川流不息地涌到了克里姆林宫的所在地——红场，观看各个建筑物上的辉煌灯火。高尔基大街特别热闹。人们的注意力都集中在中央电报局大厦上面，那里众多的电灯串成了各种各样的图表，说明了苏联新五年计划中规定的国民经济发展的目标。成群结队的人们也簇拥在新建的高楼大厦周围。莫斯科大学的新校舍——列宁山上的科学宫笼罩在一千二百盏强烈弧光灯的光辉中，这些弧光灯组成了“斯大林光荣！”的字样。在斯摩棱斯克广场，许多大楼和新近落成的大厦也装饰得灯火通明。莫斯科正在迅速地改变它的外貌。在截至一九六○年为止的十年中，莫斯科将要建筑居住面积一千万平方公尺的房屋。在十月革命节这一天，莫斯科人民极感兴趣地看到了商店橱窗里所陈列的建筑图样，这些图样说明了莫斯科改建计划正在胜利地执行着。
    莫斯科人民庆祝节日的活动是在晚间七时在二十二个广场和大街上开始的。当克里姆林宫的钟声刚刚敲了八下，庆祝节日的礼炮骤然轰响了起来。五光十色的焰火在漆黑的夜空中画出一幅美丽的图画。狂欢的人群更加沸腾起来。
    在这一天，苏联各加盟共和国的首都以及加里宁格勒、罗夫、伯力、海参崴、英雄的列宁格勒和斯大林格勒、塞瓦斯托波尔和敖德萨等地都鸣放了庆祝节日的礼炮。
