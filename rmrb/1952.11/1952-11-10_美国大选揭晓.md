Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 8th: The US election was held on the 4th of this month. According to the results of 97% of the electoral districts announced by the United States Information Service on the 7th, Republican presidential candidate Dwight D. Eisenhower received more than 32.9 million votes, while Democratic presidential candidate Adlai Stevenson received more than 26.4 million votes. Eisenhower and Republican vice-presidential candidate Richard Nixon have therefore been elected as the next president and vice president. The new president will take office on January 20th next year.

    In Congress, the Republican Party has also gained a majority. In the Senate, the Republican Party has 48 seats, the Democratic Party has 47 seats, and there is one so-called "independent" seat. In the House of Representatives, the Republican Party won 221 seats, the Democratic Party won 212 seats, and there is one "independent" seat. There is also one vacancy due to the death of the newly elected member.

    The results of this US presidential election show that the Truman administration's policy of aggression and war preparations has lost popular support. Under the circumstances where monopoly capital controls all propaganda organs and the two parties monopolize the election, the majority of American voters who participated in the voting expressed their dissatisfaction with Truman's seven years in office by voting for the Republican Party. The "Washington Post," which is close to the government, also admitted that this was a "protest vote."

    The American bourgeois newspapers have been exaggerating this election result, touting Eisenhower as a "living symbol of national unity." The fact is: Eisenhower was able to be elected only because the American monopolists sent him to the White House to replace Truman in order to deceive the American people and divert their dissatisfaction with the current policies. The United States Information Service once pointed out that most of the Truman administration's policies were based on bipartisan policies, which is an admission that the voters' dissatisfaction with the Truman administration's policies is also dissatisfaction with the Republican Party's basic policies.

    The American people's desire for peace is so urgent that Eisenhower and Stevenson, these two loyal servants of American monopolists, have had to treat the issue of peace as a competitive subject. They took advantage of this sentiment of the American people and engaged in the most despicable and hypocritical deception on the issue of peace, emphasizing that peace was their "basic goal." However, the Democratic Party is the "ruling" party, the Korean War is still going on, and ordinary American families are still losing lives. The facts refuted the Democratic Party's cunning lies; while the Republican Party, in its "opposition" position, was able to take advantage of the Truman administration and Truman's many misdeeds, the most prominent of which was the bankrupt Korean War, to deceive the voters.

    In the final stage of the campaign, Eisenhower, in order to win people's hearts, suddenly announced that if elected, he would immediately go to Korea to seek a swift end to the Korean War. However, once the basic situation of the election was determined, this new president, who had expressed such heartache over the fact that American youth were continuing to lose their lives by the hundreds every day in Korea, not only failed to put forward any concrete proposals that were genuinely aimed at ending the Korean War quickly on a fair and reasonable basis, but also immediately went to Georgia to rest and leisurely play golf.

    The facts are very clear: the Democratic and Republican parties are both tools of the American monopoly capital's aggressive policy. Under the undemocratic electoral system monopolized by the two parties, the American people have no room for choice at all. Therefore, a bowl of tofu is still a bowl of tofu, the situation remains the same: the ruling class's current aggressive policy will not change. As soon as the presidential election was settled, the United States Information Service emphasized: "There will be no change in American foreign policy." It also pointed out that if Eisenhower's policies differ in any way from the Truman administration's current policies, it is that he will more vigorously intensify the United States' expansionist endeavors in Asia. Agence France-Presse mentioned in a Washington dispatch that the political ideas of Eisenhower and his gang are "force." Agence France-Presse quoted a semi-official source in Ottawa as saying that Eisenhower might use the excuse of shortening the Korean War to expand the war in Korea.

### 美国大选揭晓

    美国大选揭晓
    【新华社八日讯】华盛顿消息：本月四日，美国举行了大选。据美国新闻处七日消息发表的已揭晓的百分之九十七的选区的投票结果，共和党的总统候选人艾森豪威尔共得三千二百九十余万票，民主党的总统候选人史蒂文森共得两千六百四十余万票。艾森豪威尔和共和党副总统候选人尼克松因此已当选为下届总统和副总统。新总统将于明年一月二十日就任。
    在国会中，共和党亦已取得多数。在参议院中，共和党共有四十八席，民主党四十七席，另有所谓“独立的”一席。在众议院中，共和党获得了二百二十一席，民主党获得二百十二席，另“独立的”一席，其他尚有一席因新选出的议员死亡而出缺。
    这次美国总统选举的结果，说明杜鲁门政府的侵略备战政策已失尽人心。在垄断资本控制着所有宣传机关、两党垄断了选举的情况下，美国大多数参加投票的选民们用投共和党的票来表示他们对于杜鲁门七年来政绩的不满。接近政府的“华盛顿邮报”也承认，这是一次“抗议的投票”。
    美国的资产阶级报纸把这种选举结果大吹大擂，捧艾森豪威尔为“国家团结的活的象征”。事实却是：艾森豪威尔所以能够当选，不过是美国垄断资本家为了欺骗美国人民，转移美国人民对现行政策的不满，而把他送进白宫去代替杜鲁门。美国新闻处曾指出，杜鲁门政府的政策大部分是以两党政策为基础的，这就是承认了：选民们对于杜鲁门政府政策的不满也就是对共和党基本政策的不满。
    美国人民要求和平的愿望是这样迫切，以致艾森豪威尔和史蒂文森这两个美国垄断资本家的忠实仆从，都不得不把和平问题当作竞赛题目。他们利用了美国人民的这种情绪，在和平问题上玩弄了最卑鄙、最虚伪的欺骗手段，都强调和平是他们的“基本目标”。但是，民主党是“执政”党，朝鲜战争还继续在打，美国普通家庭还在死人，事实驳倒了民主党的诡谲的谎言；而共和党以“在野”地位却能利用了杜鲁门政府和杜鲁门的许多劣迹，其中最突出的就是破产了的朝鲜战争，来欺骗选民。
    在竞选运动的最后阶段，艾森豪威尔为了笼络人心，突然宣布他如果当选，就要立刻去朝鲜以求迅速结束朝鲜战争。但是，选举的基本情况一经确定，这位曾经表示因美国青年继续每日成百地在朝鲜丧失性命一事而如此心痛的新总统，不但未提出任何真正目的在于迅速在公平合理的基础上结束朝鲜战争的切实建议，而且立即到佐治亚州去休息，悠闲地打高尔夫球去了。
    事实很清楚：民主党和共和党，都是美国垄断资本的侵略政策的工具，在由两党垄断的不民主的选举制度下，美国人民根本没有选择的余地。因此，一碗豆腐，豆腐一碗，事情还是一样：美国统治阶级的现行侵略政策是不会改变的。总统选举刚见分晓，美国新闻处就着重说：“美国的外交政策不会有什么改变。”它还指出：如果说艾森豪威尔的政策和杜鲁门政府现行政策有任何不同，那就是他将更加加紧进行美国在亚洲地区的扩张事业。法新社在它的一则华盛顿消息里提到：艾森豪威尔等一帮人马的政治观念就是“武力”。法新社在另一则消息中引述渥太华某半官方方面的意见说，艾森豪威尔有可能以缩短朝鲜战争为理由来扩大朝鲜的战争。
