    Northeast Wafangdian Textile Factory Sets New Record in Reducing Sizing Costs

    Editor: After the Northeast Wafangdian Textile Factory implemented the light sizing method, Fei Xingeng, a technician in the weaving workshop, in order to further reduce sizing costs, after three months of painstaking research, successfully created dextrin juice made from corn starch to replace powdered dextrin and zinc chloride.

    In the past, when sizing yarn, the factory had to use dextrin and zinc chloride. These raw materials not only had to be purchased from inside China and abroad, but were also expensive. The dextrin juice created by Fei Xingeng is made from corn starch, which is cheaper, costing 8,000 yuan less per kilogram than powdered dextrin. Since the factory implemented the light sizing method using dextrin juice, in September, the average sizing rate dropped from 20 percent to 13.1 percent, 0.9 percent lower than the prescribed standard, saving 34 percent of the sizing materials. Now the sizing cost per bolt of People's Cloth has been reduced to 900 yuan, setting a new record for the lowest sizing cost.

    In October, the entire workshop produced 31.18 yards of cloth per machine per shift, an increase of 3.2 percent compared to September.

    东北瓦房店纺织厂创降低浆纱成本新纪录
    编辑同志：东北瓦房店纺织厂实行轻浆工作法后，织布车间技师费莘耕，为进一步降低浆纱成本，经三个月苦心钻研，创造用苞米淀粉自制糊精汁代替粉状糊精和氯化锌成功。
    该厂过去浆纱时，要用糊精和氯化锌，这种原料，不但要向关内和外国购买，而且价钱高。费莘耕创造的糊精汁，是用苞米淀粉自制，价钱便宜，每公斤较粉状糊精价低八千元。该厂自实行轻浆法利用糊精汁后，九月份，平均上浆率由百分之二十降至百分之十三点一，较规定标准降低百分之零点九，节省了用浆料百分之三十四。现在每匹人民市布的浆纱成本已降至九百元，创浆纱成本最低的新纪录。
    该厂十月份全车间每台机每班产布三十一点一八码，较九月份提高百分之三点二。    虞玉佩
