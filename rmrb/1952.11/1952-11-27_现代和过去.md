    Modernity and the Past
    By Saslavsky, Soviet Union
    Thirty-five years isn't an era; it's just a bit more than a third of a century. On the scale of history, it's merely a fleeting moment. Eras are calculated in centuries. But these past thirty-five years are far more significant than centuries in the life of mankind. The Great October Socialist Revolution drew a dividing line, separating the new from the old, opening a new epoch.
    Let us think, let us compare
    Modernity and the past,
    How incredibly unbelievable and novel!
    —Griboyedov
    It's truly hard for Soviet youth to imagine what the world was like thirty-five years ago. It's as unbelievable and strange as medieval knights in armor or gentlemen in ruffs and ladies in crinolines are to the people of 1916. Since 1917, history has been dragged forward at high speed by the locomotive of the socialist revolution. Before 1917, decades crawled along at a snail's pace; the era of our ancestors traveled in a rickety old oxcart. What people educated in capitalist consciousness considered great, eternal, and noble at that time has now become blurred to the point of being unrecognizable.
    What do the names Lloyd George, Clemenceau, and Wilson mean to the youth of our time? Too little. Yet they were the "great" figures who dominated the capitalist world in 1916. The bourgeois newspapers praised them as the most outstanding politicians and passionate orators, hailing them as figures of immortality, saying that posterity would never forget them. But just a third of a century has passed, and they have already been forgotten. Who would call them "great" today? The meaning of greatness has changed. It is now clear that these figures who once held the fate of Europe and the world in their hands were merely dwarves, shortsighted and ignorant politicians, so ridiculously self-confident, believing that they could prop up the crumbling pillars of the capitalist system with their words, their decisions, their treaties, that they could restore France and Britain to their former glory, that the governments of three bourgeois countries could divide up world hegemony.
    Nevertheless, compared to their successors today, they were remarkable figures. By the standards of the capitalist world, they were outstanding big men. And how small those standards have shrunk! The difference between Clemenceau and today's rulers of France is the measure of France's depth of decline over the past thirty-five years. It's truly hard to believe that there was a time when the Prime Minister of France could thunder at the President of the United States in Paris, even banging the table when the latter raised objections.
    Clemenceau was a reactionary, a mortal enemy of the working class, an imperialist beast. But he was also the last major representative of the French bourgeoisie's concept of national independence based on bourgeois democracy. It was by flaunting this concept that he gained prestige. He represented a strong, autonomous, and independent France, and although American capital had already infiltrated French industry, and American bankers were sitting at the tables of the two hundred families who ruled France, they had not yet dared to boldly interfere in the French government. They called Clemenceau the Tiger. This French imperialist, who had once been a tiger to the enemies of the Republic, later became a tiger to the working class and socialists, but he was also often a tiger to German militarists.
    The history of the French bourgeoisie is the history of a tiger ultimately turning into a cheap cat.
    "Now, there isn't even a shadow of 'national principle' left. Now, the bourgeoisie sells the rights and independence of the nation in exchange for dollars." (Stalin)
    Lloyd George was the last major representative of British liberalism. Through him, British imperialism still wanted to play with the principle of "personal freedom," still wearing the mask of democracy. The British bourgeoisie still felt strong enough to want this charade. It still retained the pride of the era when the British flag flew over all the oceans of the world, when the mother country tightly grasped its dominions and colonies, taking a little bit from the huge colonial profits to distribute to those labor aristocrats. When Lloyd George stepped down, he had no successor. British liberalism is an uninherited legacy of old and failing bourgeois politics. It disappeared before the disintegration of the British Empire. The bourgeoisie that ruled Britain, filled with fear and anxiety about their increasing decline, had plunged into the camp of violent reaction, trampling on the principles of bourgeois democracy at will. "This banner of bourgeois-democratic freedom has been cast aside." (Stalin)
    That British lion often demanded its share when the imperialists divided the spoils of plunder. Today, history depicts Churchill standing in the palm of the United States. He asked for a seat for Britain at the conference table in the Pacific... but that close friend and benefactor was not even willing to give his ally the scraps from the human feast.
    The French tiger became a prowling cat; the British lion became a dirty cur. Thus passes worldly glory—speaking of the glory of the capitalist world.
    Indeed, as Britain and France declined from their peak, American imperialism has grown fat and large, straddling the world with its two legs. But as it expanded, its world shrank. In a third of a century, capitalism has lost a third of its domain.
    And disintegration is accelerating. The bourgeois mind is filled with a premonition of the end.
    Where once there was a great banquet, now there are coffins;
    Where once there were shouts of wild revelry,
    Now there is the weeping of mourners;
    And Death is watching everything...
    —Derzhavin
    The sorrowful cries of mourners fill all the bourgeois newspapers. They are at a loss. Who could have foreseen such a change in the situation thirty-five years ago? What bourgeois politician, economist, or philosopher was then troubled in their sleep by such a terrible and strange nightmare? For the bourgeoisie, the most terrible and strange nightmare is the victory of socialism, the birth, growth, and maturation of a new world. Communism, which was nothing more than a wandering specter to the bourgeoisie a hundred years ago, has now firmly established itself on the ground.
    Who could have known? Who could have foreseen?
    Lenin and Stalin, the Communists, knew and foresaw. Today, most of the people of the world understand that the most significant historical event of the period before the October Revolution was not this or that war, not this or that speech, not the statements or actions of Clemenceau, Lloyd George, Kaiser Wilhelm, Tsar Nicholas, and the like—all of which have become the past, have been forgotten, and are only known to archivists and historians. The most remarkable and epoch-making thing before 1917 was Lenin's writing of "Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism" and Stalin's writing of "Marxism and the National Question."
    Lenin inherited, developed, and expounded on the doctrines of Marxism, pointing out that imperialism is the highest and final stage of capitalism. He scientifically proved the inevitability of capitalism's collapse and demise, proving the inevitability of the capitalist system being replaced by a new social and economic order—the socialist order. Lenin discovered the law of uneven economic and political development of capitalism, and theoretically proved the possibility of socialism first achieving victory in individual capitalist countries. He predicted that the new social system led by the working class would expand the productive forces to limits unimaginable under capitalism, and that victorious socialism would create the economic conditions to move society to the higher stage of communism.
    Stalin created the theoretical principles of the new state system, where the people abolished the power of landlords and capitalists, and established a state of equal freedom for all nationalities. He foresaw and predicted the rise of a powerful alliance of socialist republics.
    Lenin and Stalin not only studied the economic laws of capitalism, not only foresaw and predicted the course of historical development, the general crisis of capitalism, and the victory of the proletarian socialist revolution; but also cultivated, trained, and steeled a cadre of revolutionary, militant proletarian parties to shoulder the task of leading the revolution, guiding the working class along the correct path to victory, and ensuring the victory of revolutionary war.
    What Lenin and Stalin foresaw, predicted, and revealed became the program of the Russian Bolshevik Communist Party and was strictly put into practice. No imperialist force could save the already decayed social and political system of Tsarist Russia. The Russian people chose the Communist Party as their party, supported Lenin and Stalin as their leaders, overthrew the strongest pillar of imperialism, and established a new country—the Soviet Socialist Republic, thereby opening a new era in world history.
    The victory of the Great October Socialist Revolution is the greatest victory of Marxist-Leninist science, and the overwhelmingly great achievement of true scientific theoretical analysis combined with the strategy and tactics of the Communist Party based on science. The birth of the first socialist country is a festive day for all oppressed and enslaved workers groaning under the yoke of barbaric exploiting groups, a happy event for all working people. The imperialists of America, Britain, France, and Germany were greatly enraged by the rise of the socialist country, and they attacked this young workers' and peasants' republic, attempting to strangle it in the cradle, but the workers of these countries supported the socialist country as if it were their own motherland, providing the Soviet people with fraternal assistance, helping them drive the invaders from their land.
    All progressive men and women respect Lenin and Stalin's genius and great hearts, recognizing them as mentors on the truly correct path of life, as forerunners of mankind's progress toward happiness, freedom, and communism.
    Thirty-five years have passed since the workers of Russia, led by the peasants and working masses, overthrew the landlords and capitalists and took power into their own hands. These past years have shown the true realization of the predictions of Marxist-Leninist theory, further developed in Stalin's works, which revealed that under the socialist system, the social productive forces will surpass the state that capitalism can reach in every way incomparably; The socialist national economy, as is well known, has no crisis, unemployment or poverty of workers, but on the contrary, can ensure its prosperous development, develop the economic and cultural forces that capitalism cannot achieve; the socialist system will show its incomparable superiority over the capitalist enslavement system.
    In these thirty-five years, socialist construction has accumulated rich experience. In these thirty-five years, the ideas of Marxist-Leninism, enriched by the great Stalin, have been theoretically developed from these experiences. On the occasion of the thirty-fifth anniversary of the victory of the socialist revolution, a new event of world historical importance, Stalin's work "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR" was published. This work reveals to the Soviet people the road to climb to the peak of communism, and arms all people with the knowledge of revolutionary social reform methods and means.
    Lenin and Stalin's scientific predictions have been realized, and the Soviet Union has become the most powerful country in the world. Their prediction that socialism would first be victorious in one country, and then in other countries, has also been fully realized. The 19th Congress of the Party of Lenin and Stalin made this prediction a brilliant confirmation. The great People's Republic of China, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and the Mongolian People's Republic, as well as the European People's Democratic Countries, now form a close family of people, and they have embarked on the road illuminated by the Soviet Union.
    Capitalism was depicted as an iron chain around the earth. Some of the most important links in this chain have been broken, so this iron chain no longer exists. The attempt by American imperialism to reconnect the two ends of this chain is in vain, because it has been broken and will be broken forever.
    The 19th Congress clearly showed that the fraternal ties between the working people of all countries and their mutual support have been greatly enhanced, thus making it more difficult for imperialism to drive the people against the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic Countries than it was thirty-five years ago.
    In these thirty-five years, the socialist camp has expanded and become an unshakable force, which is growing and developing year by year. In thirty-five years, the capitalist camp has become more and more decadent, so hated by the people, and can only linger through the sins of bloodshed and by stepping up preparations for another imperialist massacre, and this war preparation will inevitably lead to its final collapse. American imperialism can only see life in war. It is deathly afraid of peace.
    The socialist camp desires peace, strives for peace, and defends peace. It is not afraid of war; it is equally strong in peace or war. For the benefit of mankind, it advocates peace, advocates an armistice and peace negotiations in Korea, advocates an end to the arms race, advocates a ban on atomic weapons and germ warfare, and advocates peaceful coexistence among the five major powers.
    In these thirty-five years, the Soviet people have traveled a glorious road of victory. The new Party Constitution of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union has set itself a great historical task: to build a communist society, to gradually transition from socialism to communism; to continue to improve the material and cultural standards of society, to educate members of society in the spirit of internationalism and fraternal ties with the working people of all countries; to infinitely enhance the national defense strength of the Soviet homeland, and to oppose the enemy's aggressive actions.
    Entering its thirty-sixth year, the vibrant and powerful Soviet Socialist State is implementing its new five-year development plan, which inspires all its children—Soviet patriots—with legitimate pride, and also makes all progressive men and women rejoice. The victory and triumph of communism, the genius of the socialist revolution, the beautiful future of mankind and its spiritual treasure, if expressed in one word, one name, that name is: Stalin.

    现代和过去
    苏联  萨斯拉夫斯基
    三十五年并不算一个时代；它只比一个世纪的三分之一多一点。以历史的尺度来衡量，在过去这只不过是一个短暂的一瞬而已。时代是以世纪来计算的。但是过去的这三十五年，在人类的生活中，它的重要性远超过几个世纪。伟大的十月社会主义革命划了一道分界线，把新与旧划分开，打开一个新的纪元。
    我们想一想，比一比
    现代和过去，
    让人多么难以相信又多么新奇！
    ——格里包耶多夫
    苏维埃的年青人真是很难想像三十五年前的世界是怎么一个样子。就好像穿着盔甲的中世纪骑士或者穿着绉领衫的绅士和穿着百摺裙的贵妇对于一九一六年的人们那样的难以相信和奇异。从一九一七年起，历史已由社会主义革命的火车头拖曳着以高速度前进。在一九一七年以前，几十年只是以蜗牛的步子蠕动；祖先的时代坐在一辆老牛破车上行进。那个时候受了资本主义意识教化的人们所认为伟大、永恒和高贵的东西，现在已经变得模糊不清，到了难以辨认的程度了。
    对于我们这个时代的年青人，劳合·乔治、克里蒙梭和威尔逊的名字有什么意义呢？太小了。可是他们是一九一六年资本主义世界显赫一时的“伟大”人物。资产阶级报纸把他们歌颂为最卓越的政治家，热情的演说家，把他们捧为永垂不朽的人物，说后代对他们将会永志不忘。但是一个世纪的三分之一刚过去，他们就已被人遗忘了。今天还有谁会称他们“伟大”呢？伟大的意义已经变了。现在很明白，这些曾经把欧洲和世界命运掌握在手中的人物，只是一些侏儒、一些目光短小和无知的政客，他们是如此可笑地充满自信，满以为依靠他们的说话，他们的决定，他们的条约便可以撑住资本主义体系摇摇欲坠的支柱，便可以使法兰西和不列颠恢复以往的强盛，便可以由三个资产阶级国家的政府瓜分世界的霸权。
    虽然如此，和他们今天的后继者比起来，他们却是了不起的人物。用资本主义世界的标准来衡量，他们是出类拔萃的大人物。而这些标准已缩得多小了！克里蒙梭和法国今天的统治者之间的差别，就是三十五年来法国沉沦深度的尺寸。真的叫人很难相信竟会有过这样的时代，法国的总理在巴黎对美国的总统大发雷霆，当后者提出异议的时候，他甚至拍起桌子来。
    克里蒙梭是一个反动分子，是工人阶级的死敌，是一只帝国主义的恶兽。但是他也是法国资产阶级民主的民族独立观念的最后一个主要代表人物。他就是因为标榜这种观念而获得声望的。他代表一个强大、自主和独立的法国，虽然美国资本已侵入法国工业，美国银行家已坐在统治法国的二百家族的桌上，但是他们还未敢冒然插足于法国政府之中。他们称克里蒙梭为老虎。对于共和国的敌人曾经是一只老虎的这个法国帝国主义者，后来成了对工人阶级和社会主义者的老虎了，但是他对于德国军国主义者也时常是一只老虎。
    法国资产阶级的历史是一只老虎最后变为一只贱猫的历史。
    “现在，连一点‘民族原则’的影子也没有了。现在，资产阶级出卖民族的权利和独立来换取美元。”（斯大林）
    劳合·乔治是英国自由主义的最后的主要代表人物。通过他，英国帝国主义还想玩弄“个人自由”的原则，仍然戴着民主的假面具。英国资产阶级仍然感觉自己还够强大，足以要这种把戏。它仍然保持着不列颠国旗在世界一切海洋上飘扬的那个时代的骄傲，这个母国紧紧抓着它的自治领和殖民地，它从巨额的殖民地利润中拿出一点点来分给那些劳工贵族。劳合·乔治下了台便后继无人了。英国的自由主义是老朽的资产阶级政策的一份没人承继的遗产。它在大英帝国瓦解之前就看不见了。统治英国的资产阶级怀着对他们日益衰落的恐惧和忧虑，已投进狂暴的反动阵营中，把资产阶级民主的原则肆意践踏。“资产阶级—民主的自由这种旗帜已经被抛在一边了。”（斯大林）
    那只英国的狮子在帝国主义瓜分掠夺品的时候时常索取它的一份。今天的历史却刻画出邱吉尔站在美国的手掌中。他要求在太平洋的会议桌上给英国一席，……但是那个挚友和施主却连人肉宴的残羹也不肯赏给他的盟友。
    法国的老虎变成了一只来回巡逡的猫；英国的狮子变成了一只肮脏的恶狗。世上荣华如斯而逝——说的是资本主义世界的荣华。
    的确，在英国和法国由盛而衰之际，美国帝国主义已变得又肥又大了，而且张开着两条大腿。但是当它扩张的时候，它的世界却缩小了。在三分之一个世纪中资本主义已丧失了它三分之一的范围。
    而且分崩离析在加速进行。资产阶级的心灵充满着对末日的预感。
    那儿曾经大排筵席，如今却摆着棺材；
    那儿曾经发出狂饮的欢呼，
    如今却响起吊客的痛哭；
    而死神在看着一切………
    ——节尔若汶
    吊客的悲痛的哭声充满着所有资产阶级报纸。他们不知所措。三十五年前谁能预见这样一种局势的变化呢？有那一个资产阶级的政治家、经济学家或者哲学家那时候曾被如此可怕和奇怪的梦魇困扰过他们的酣睡？对于资产阶级，最可怕和最奇怪的梦魇就是社会主义的胜利，就是一个新世界的诞生、生长和成熟。共产主义在一百年前对于资产阶级还不过是一个游荡的怪影，现在已经在地面上安稳地立足了。
    谁能知道呢？谁能预见到呢？
    列宁和斯大林，共产党人，曾经知道和预见到。今天大部分世界人民明白十月革命以前那个时期最重大的历史事件并不是这一场或那一场战争，并不是这一番或那一番演讲，并不是克里蒙梭、劳合·乔治、威廉大帝、沙皇尼古拉之流的声明或行动——所有这一切都成过去，已被人遗忘，只为档案专家和历史专家所知。一九一七年以前最具有显著的划时代意义的是列宁写出他的“帝国主义是资本主义底最高阶段”和斯大林写出他的“马克思主义与民族问题”。
    列宁继承、发展和阐发了马克思主义的学说，指出帝国主义是资本主义最高和最后的阶段。他科学地证明了资本主义崩溃和灭亡的不可避免，证明了资本主义制度被新的社会和经济秩序——社会主义秩序所代替的不可避免。列宁发现了资本主义经济政治发展不平衡的规律，并从理论上证明社会主义首先在个别资本主义国家中取得胜利的可能性。他预言工人阶级所领导的新社会制度将把生产力扩大到资本主义不可想像的限度，胜利的社会主义并将创造经济条件，使社会转向共产主义的更高阶段。
    斯大林创立了新的国家制度的理论原则，人民废除了地主和资本家的权力，而建立一个各民族平等自由的国家。他预见并预言社会主义共和国的强大联盟的兴起。
    列宁和斯大林不仅研究了资本主义的经济法则，不仅预见和预言历史发展的进程、资本主义的总危机和无产阶级社会主义革命的胜利；并且培养、训练和锻炼了革命的、有战斗性的无产阶级政党的干部，以担负领导革命、指引工人阶级沿着正确道路走向胜利和保证革命战争取得胜利的任务。
    列宁和斯大林所预见、预言和揭示的，都变成了俄国布尔什维克共产党的纲领，而且严格地付诸实行。任何帝国主义的力量都不能够挽救已经腐朽的沙皇俄国的社会和政治制度。俄国人民选择了共产党为他们的政党，拥戴列宁和斯大林为他们的领袖，推翻了帝国主义最强大的一根支柱，建立了一个新的国家——苏维埃社会主义共和国，从而打开世界历史的一个新纪元。
    伟大十月社会主义革命的胜利，是马克思列宁主义科学的最大胜利，是真正的科学理论分析与建立在科学基础上的共产党的战略战术的压倒一切的巨大成就。第一个社会主义国家的诞生，对于所有呻吟在野蛮的剥削集团桎梏之下的被压迫、被奴役的工人，是一个喜庆的日子，对于一切劳动人民是一件高兴的事情。美、英、法、德国帝国主义者因社会主义国家的兴起而大为激怒，它们就进攻这个年青的工农共和国，企图在摇篮里把它扼杀，但这些国家的工人们却像对待自己祖国一样地支持社会主义国家，给苏联人民以兄弟般的援助，协助他们把侵略者从他们的国土上赶走。
    所有进步的男女都对列宁和斯大林的天才、伟大的心志表示尊敬，把他们认作为真正正确的生活道路的导师，认作为人类走向幸福、自由与共产主义的先导。
    自从俄国的工人领导农民劳动群众推翻地主与资本家，把政权掌到自己的手里到现在，已经过去三十五年了。这些已经过去了的年代，显示了在斯大林著作中进一步发展了的、马克思列宁主义理论的预言的真正实现，这些预言揭示：在社会主义制度之下，社会生产力将在一切方面无可比拟地超过资本主义所能达到的境地；社会主义的国民经济，如所周知，是没有危机、失业或工人的贫困的，而恰恰相反，能够保证其繁荣的不断发展，开发资本主义所不能取得的经济与文化力量的泉源；社会主义体系将显示出它胜过资本主义奴役体系的无比优越性。
    在这三十五年中，社会主义建设已经积累起了丰富的经验。在这三十五年中，被伟大斯大林所丰富了的马克思列宁主义的思想，已从这些经验而得到了理论上的发展。在纪念社会主义革命胜利的三十五周年时，一件具有世界历史重要性的新事件——斯大林的著作“苏联社会主义经济问题”发表了。这一著作向苏联人民揭示了攀登共产主义高峰的道路，并以革命的社会改革的方式和方法的知识武装了一切人民。
    列宁与斯大林的科学预言已经实现了，苏联已成为世界上最强大的国家。他们关于社会主义将首先在一个国家内胜利，并接着将在其他国家内胜利的预言也完全实现了。列宁与斯大林党的第十九次代表大会使这一预言得到了光辉的证实。伟大的中华人民共和国、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国与蒙古人民共和国，以及欧洲人民民主国家，现在已组成了一个亲密的人民的大家庭，他们已走上了由苏联所照亮的道路。
    资本主义曾被描绘成为环绕地球的铁锁链。这个锁链的某些最重要的环节已被打断，因而这铁锁链已不再存在了。美帝国主义想再把这个锁链的两端连结起来的企图是徒然的，因为它既被打断，就永远被打断了。
    第十九次代表大会明白地显示了：各国劳动人民之间的兄弟般的联系与他们的互相支持已经大大地增强，这样，也就使得帝国主义比三十五年以前更难驱使人民来反对苏联与人民民主国家了。
    在这三十五年中，社会主义阵营已经扩大并成为一个不可动摇的力量，它正在一年一年壮大发展。而在三十五年中资本主义阵营则变得更加衰老了，它是如此的被人民所憎恨，只有靠罪恶的流血，只有用加紧准备另一次帝国主义的大屠杀来苟延残喘，而这种备战则又必然会导致它的最后崩溃。美帝国主义只有在战争中才看得到生机。它对和平怕得要死。
    社会主义阵营热望和平，争取和平与保卫着和平。它绝不害怕战争；它在和平或战争中同样是强大的。为了人类的利益，它主张和平，主张在朝鲜停战并举行和平谈判，主张结束军备竞赛，主张禁止原子武器与细菌战争，主张五大国和平共处。
    在这三十五年中，苏联人民已经走过了一条胜利的光荣道路。苏联共产党的新党章给它自己提出了一个伟大的历史任务：建设共产主义社会，由社会主义逐渐过渡到共产主义；继续提高社会物质与文化水准，以国际主义和与各国劳动人民的兄弟般联系的精神来教育社会成员；无限地增强苏维埃祖国的国防力量，反对敌人的侵略行动。
    当进入第三十六年的时候，充满着活力的、强大的苏维埃社会主义国家正在执行着它的新的五年发展计划，它鼓舞了它所有的儿女——苏维埃爱国人民，使他们怀着正当的自豪，同时也使一切进步男女欢欣鼓舞。共产主义的胜利与凯旋，社会主义革命的天才，人类的美好将来与它的精神宝藏，如果用一个字，一个名字来表示，这个名字就是：斯大林。（谭文瑞、陈有为译自苏联“新时代”杂志第四十五期）
