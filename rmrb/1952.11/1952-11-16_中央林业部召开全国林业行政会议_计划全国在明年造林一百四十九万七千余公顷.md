    The National Forestry Administrative Conference convened by the Ministry of Forestry of the Central People's Government concluded on the 6th, lasting sixteen days. The conference extensively exchanged work experiences, resolved pressing issues, and discussed and approved the report by Liang Xi, Minister of the Central People's Government's Ministry of Forestry, regarding the national forestry guidelines and tasks for 1953. To meet the needs of national construction, this conference decided to launch a large-scale afforestation and silviculture campaign in key areas in the future.

    Over the past three years, under the general task of ensuring farmland water conservancy and supplying timber needed for industrial construction, the national forestry work has implemented the policy of universal forest protection, focused afforestation, and rational timber harvesting and utilization, achieving great results. The country has completed afforestation of 1.35 million hectares and mountain closure for forest cultivation of 3.61 million hectares. In some areas, initial results have been achieved in soil and water conservation and disaster reduction. To protect forests, especially to prevent forest fires, forest protection organizations have grown to 704,496, with 1,570,387 forest rangers (statistics as of the end of June this year). Forest fire losses, with 1950 as 100, decreased to 5 percent by the spring of 1952. In terms of timber harvesting, the needs of national construction have been basically guaranteed. To coordinate with afforestation and harvesting tasks, considerable survey and measurement work has also been carried out on forests and suitable afforestation land.

    To meet the needs of the country's large-scale long-term construction, the conference decided that, in addition to continuing to implement the policy of universal forest protection and rational timber harvesting and utilization, national forestry work must emphasize planned and vigorous afforestation and development of new forest areas in the future. In terms of afforestation and silviculture, to overcome wind and sand disasters, in addition to continuing to build protective forest belts in the western part of Northeast China and windbreak and sand-fixation forests in western Hebei and eastern Henan, planning should begin for the construction of a protective forest belt from Fugu to Dingbian in northern Shaanxi, and surveys should be conducted on suitable afforestation land from Guyuan in Chahar to Shanba in Suiyuan. To cooperate with the national Yellow River control plan, flood control forests should be vigorously created, starting first from the Jing River, Wuding River, and other basins. Flood control forests should continue to be created in the upper and middle reaches of the Huai River (Tongbai Mountain and Funiu Mountain in Henan, Dabie Mountain in northern Anhui) and the Yongding River (Hengshan Mountains and Yanqing Chaigoubao in Chahar Province, and the mountainous areas of western Hebei). In order to strengthen soil and water conservation in mountainous areas, prepare afforestation conditions, and continue to mobilize the masses to carry out mountain closure for forest cultivation in a planned manner, in combination with the living and production interests of residents and taking into account the needs of local people for firewood and grazing. Renewal work must be carried out in harvested areas to restore the abandoned mountains and forests. All localities must pay attention to the tending of young forests and mobilize the masses to carry out sporadic tree planting. Mass mobilization and the various business departments should vigorously carry out afforestation near mines, along railways and highways, and along riverbanks. The conference pointed out that, in order to enable afforestation and mountain closure for forest cultivation to be carried out on a large scale in a planned and rapid manner, it is necessary to widely mobilize the masses and organize them to cooperate. In 1953, the survival rate of afforestation is required to be no less than 80 percent in general areas; and no less than 60 percent in areas with difficult conditions. After afforestation, someone must be responsible for protection and tending. Based on the above policies, the conference requested the forestry administrative agencies of major administrative regions to formulate phased and annual plans. The preliminary afforestation plan for 1953 formulated by the forestry conference is: nationwide afforestation of 1,497,810 hectares, seedling cultivation of 24,628 hectares, seed collection of 15,387,963 kilograms, tending of young forests 2,470,558 hectares, renewal of 179,730 hectares in harvested areas, and mountain closure for forest cultivation of 3,213,666 hectares.

    Regarding forest industry, the conference pointed out that, in order to supply the timber needed for the country's major industrial construction, it is necessary to develop new forest areas in a planned manner and carry out rational harvesting. In the forest areas of Northeast China and Inner Mongolia, the proportion of mechanization in harvesting and transportation should be strengthened, professional workers should be fixed, and seasonal operations should be changed to year-round operations. To save timber, it is necessary to develop industries such as timber processing, wood preservation, and plywood in a planned manner, give full play to the production capacity of existing timber processing plants, and improve product quality.

    In terms of forest survey, in order to meet the needs of harvesting and afforestation, a general survey and detailed survey of forest land and suitable afforestation land must be carried out, and the Soviet Union's advanced experience of square survey method must be vigorously promoted. The conference requested that provinces that have established professional survey teams should expand the survey teams, and those that have not established them should establish them quickly. In 1953, the country plans to complete a forest resource survey of 3.64 million hectares and a survey of suitable afforestation land of 8.02 million hectares.

    In addition, this conference also made specific plans for forest protection and large-scale training of cadres. (Xinhua News Agency)

    中央林业部召开全国林业行政会议
    计划全国在明年造林一百四十九万七千余公顷
    中央人民政府林业部召开的全国林业行政会议，历时十六天，已于六日闭幕。大会广泛地交流了工作经验，解决了目前急需解决的问题，讨论和通过了中央人民政府林业部部长梁希关于一九五三年全国林业方针任务的报告。为了适应国家建设的需要，这次会议决定今后要在重点地区展开大规模造林育林运动。
    三年来，全国林业工作在保障农田水利，供应工业建设所需木材的总任务下，贯彻普遍护林、重点造林、合理采伐利用木材的方针，作出了很大成绩。全国完成了造林一百三十五万公顷，封山育林三百六十一万公顷，在某些地区已初步收到水土保持，减免天灾的成效。为了保护森林，特别是防止森林火灾，护林组织已发展到七十万四千四百九十六个，护林员一百五十七万零三百八十七人（截至本年六月底的统计），森林火灾的损失以一九五零年为一百，一九五二年春已减少到百分之五。在采伐木材方面，基本上保证了国家建设的需要。为了配合造林和采伐任务，对森林及宜林地也作了不少调查测量工作。
    为适应国家大规模长期建设的需要，会议决定：今后全国林业工作除继续贯彻普遍护林和合理采伐利用木材的方针外，必须强调有计划地大力造林和开发新林区。在造林育林方面，为克服风沙灾害，除继续营造东北西部防护林带和冀西、豫东的防风林、防沙林外，应开始筹划营造由府谷到定边的陕北防护林带，并调查从察哈尔的沽源起到绥远陕坝
    一带的宜林地。为配合国家治黄（河）计划，应首先从泾河、无定河等流域开始大力营造防洪林。在淮河上中游（河南的桐柏山、伏牛山，皖北的大别山）、永定河（察哈尔省内恒山山脉和延庆柴沟堡等地，河北西部山区）继续营造防洪林。各地山区为加强水土保持，准备造林条件，应在结合居民群众生活，生产利益和照顾当地群众采樵、放牧的原则下，继续发动群众有计划地开展封山育林运动。在采伐迹地，必须进行更新工作，把已荒废的山林恢复起来。各地都须注意幼林抚育工作，并发动群众进行零星植树。在矿山附近、铁道公路两旁、河流沿岸应发动群众和各业务部门大力造林。会议指出，为使造林和封山育林工作能够有计划地大规模迅速展开，必须广泛发动群众，组织起来合作进行。一九五三年要求造林成活率在一般地区不低于百分之八十；在条件困难地区亦不低于百分之六十。造林后必须有人负责保护和抚育。根据上述方针，会议要求各大行政区林业行政机构拟定分段分年计划。林业会议初步拟定的一九五三年造林计划是：全国造林一百四十九万七千八百一十公顷，育苗二万四千六百二十八公顷，采种一千五百三十八万七千九百六十三公斤，抚育幼林二百四十七万零五百五十八公顷，采伐迹地更新一十七万九千七百三十公顷，封山育林三百二十一万三千六百六十六公顷。
    森林工业方面，会议指出，为了供应国家主要工业建设所需用的木材，必须有计划地开发新林区，进行合理采伐。东北和内蒙的林区，应加强采伐和运搬工作上的机械化比重，固定专业工人，改变季节性作业为常年作业。为节约木材，必须有计划地发展制材、木材防腐和胶合板等工业，充分发挥现有制材厂的生产能力，提高产品质量。
    林野调查方面，为适应采伐和造林的需要，对林地和宜林地必须作概况调查和详细调查，并大力推行苏联先进经验方格调查法。会议要求已设立专业调查队的省份，把调查队加以扩充，未设立的迅速设立。一九五三年内，全国计划完成森林资源调查三百六十四万公顷，宜林地调查八百零二万公顷。
    此外，这次会议对护林和大量培养训练干部的工作，也作出了具体计划。    （新华社）
