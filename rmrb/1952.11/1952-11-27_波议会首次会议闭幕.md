Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw: The first session of the Parliament of the Polish People's Republic, which began on the 20th, closed in Warsaw on the 22nd. Members of the State Council, headed by A. Zawadzki, and government leaders, headed by B. Bierut, attended the meeting. The meeting heard a report by the new Minister of Public Security, S. Radkiewicz, on behalf of the government, on the amnesty bill. In his report, Radkiewicz pointed out that Poland's people's democratic system has brought about fundamental changes in the living and working conditions of the people and enabled them to enjoy full democratic rights. The consciousness of the Polish people has been greatly raised, and thus criminal cases have been greatly reduced. Under these circumstances, in order to give criminals more opportunities to rehabilitate themselves, the conditions for reducing and remitting sentences have fully matured. Radkiewicz then put forward specific proposals on reducing and remitting sentences for criminals sentenced to death, life imprisonment, and fixed-term imprisonment. He also pointed out that criminals who act as foreign spies and other criminals who endanger national independence and sovereignty are not eligible for exemption or reduction of sentences. After the amnesty bill was studied by the Legislative Committee of the Parliament and reported to the Parliament, it was unanimously adopted by all members of Parliament.
    In addition, the meeting also passed a motion on national inspection work jointly proposed by the State Council and the Council of Ministers. At this point, the first session of the Parliament of the Polish People's Republic was declared closed.

    波议会首次会议闭幕
    【新华社讯】据波兰通讯社华沙讯：二十日开始举行的波兰人民共和国议会第一次会议，已于二十二日在华沙闭幕。以亚·萨瓦德斯基为首的国务委员会的委员们和以波·贝鲁特为首的政府首长都参加了这个会议。会议听取了新任公安部部长史·拉德基维兹代表政府提出的关于大赦法案的报告。拉德基维兹在报告中指出：波兰的人民民主制度已使人民的生活条件和劳动条件发生了根本的变化，并使他们能够享受充分的民主权利。波兰人民的觉悟已经大大提高，因而犯罪的案件已大大减少。在这种情况下，为了给罪犯们以更多的改过自新的机会，对他们实行减刑和免刑的条件已经完全成熟。拉德基维兹接着提出了关于对被判处死刑、无期徒刑和有期徒刑的罪犯实行减刑和免刑的具体建议。他还指出：那些充当外国间谍的罪犯及其他危害国家独立和主权的罪犯们，不在免刑或减刑之列。这个大赦法案经议会立法委员会研究完毕并向议会提出报告后，获得全体议员的一致通过。
    此外，会议还通过了国务委员会和部长会议联合提出的一项关于国家监察工作的议案。至此，波兰人民共和国议会的第一次会议即宣告闭幕。
