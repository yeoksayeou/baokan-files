Comrade Bobov, a Soviet Expert, Helps Us
Li Huaqing

    In the past three years, under the correct leadership of the Party, and with the friendly and patient assistance of the Soviet Union and Soviet experts, the health work in Northeast China has been launched and has achieved brilliant accomplishments. In our work, Soviet medical expert Comrade Bobov has provided great and multifaceted assistance. Whether in implementing the national health policy or in carrying out medical and preventive work, he has enabled us to learn many advanced experiences and avoid many detours.

    Comrade Bobov once suggested to us: "Rural health work depends on health institutions. Therefore, rural doctors must understand treatment and also be able to do organizational work." This was his first consideration for the health care of the vast working people in our rural areas. Comrade Bobov gave us even greater assistance in the key pilot work of rural health in Northeast China. For example, the Shaling District Health Experimental Station, 15 kilometers west of Shenyang, was established with his personal assistance. Before and after the establishment of the station, Comrade Bobov personally went to the district several times to assist in selecting the site and planning other matters.

    Following the forty health experimental counties in 1950, our Northeast Region opened up twelve more health experimental counties, established fifty new-type district health centers, and carried out key experiments. This work was carried out with the direct assistance of Comrade Bobov.

    In the past three years, the health organizations in the vast rural areas of Northeast China have flourished under the promotion and influence of these health experimental counties. By the first half of 1952, 94.6 percent of the counties and banners in the entire Northeast had county health centers or county hospitals, an increase of 40.2 percent compared with 1949; district health centers increased by 1781.4 percent compared with 1949, accounting for 62.2 percent of the rural districts in the entire Northeast. Some counties and districts have developed to the village level, with 840 central village health centers and village health stations. These achievements are all related to the assistance of Comrade Bobov.

    In the direction of the development of medical and preventive institutions, Comrade Bobov further told us to strive to implement the "regional system" and the "physician district system." Only in this way can we avoid wasting manpower due to overlapping institutions, and can we maximize the effectiveness of the limited manpower under the current shortage of health personnel; only in this way can we better implement the principle of "prevention first." This suggestion is very important. Taking the Northeast Industrial Department system as an example, in Dalian there are several bureaus with two or thirty factories, each with its own health center. Even the headquarters of the No. 7 and No. 20 Machinery Factories are in the same building, but each has its own health center. These health centers can only see a few outpatients every day and cannot solve bigger problems. If they are unified and a hospital is organized with the existing personnel, manpower and time can be saved. Therefore, we accepted this opinion and reduced many overlaps and inconsistencies in the work of the Anshan City and Angang health work, as well as the Fushun City and Fushun Mining Bureau health work.

    On implementing the principle of "prevention first," Comrade Bobov's view is that it is wrong to simply think that prevention is only to prevent the occurrence of infectious diseases; taking care of and observing workers is also prevention, paying attention to clothing, food, and housing is also prevention, caring for children's physical development, regular physical examinations of workers, and promoting sports are also prevention. At the same time, early detection of patients, early diagnosis, and treatment of patients with new therapies are also part of preventive work. In order to accomplish the above tasks, it is wrong for treating physicians to only do treatment work without investigating the patient's clothing, food, and housing, and without frequently observing the patient's living conditions. These beneficial insights have greatly helped our work and medical personnel.

    In terms of medical treatment, Comrade Bobov also introduced us to nutrition, physiotherapy, and other therapies based on the advanced experience of the Soviet Union. As everyone knows, in the past we did not pay enough attention to physiotherapy work; since then, some hospitals and sanatoriums have begun to establish physiotherapy equipment and carry out mud therapy, hydrotherapy, electrotherapy, phototherapy, thermotherapy, and other work, and have achieved certain results. Therefore, the cure rate has been improved. Of course, Comrade Bobov not only talked about it, but also personally helped the affiliated hospital of the China Medical University to establish and improve the new physiotherapy department, and assisted in training physiotherapy work cadres. This has laid a good foundation for us in the development of physiotherapy work.

    Most of the medical institutions in Northeast China have the phenomenon of emphasizing outpatient clinics and not inpatient wards, emphasizing rooms occupied by staff and not patient rooms, and lacking necessary admission offices and sanitary kitchens. In response to these situations, Comrade Bobov suggested that we first establish admission offices and sanitary kitchens in hospitals. At present, 20 sanitary kitchens and 18 admission offices have been established in hospitals above the provincial and municipal levels. This has reversed the thinking of health personnel not paying attention to kitchen work, but instead thinking that it is the responsibility of general affairs staff; it has also changed the past restaurant-style practices of only talking about taste and not nutritional value, thereby improving the attention of health personnel to nutritional therapy.

    With the country's economic construction, Northeast China has carried out some basic construction work on medical facilities in recent years. In the design of basic buildings, Comrade Bobov also assisted us in formulating a series of scientific design standards and personally trained design cadres, so that the design work of medical facilities in Northeast China has a foundation and is moving towards a scientific and practical path.

    In the design, Comrade Bobov particularly emphasized the principle of "everything for the patient" and "thoroughly implementing prevention first"; clearly and thoroughly criticizing the bourgeois viewpoints in the design of medical facilities. The design of medical facilities for the masses must not only pay attention to outpatient clinics but also pay special attention to inpatient wards, because the inpatient ward is a place where patients stay for a relatively long time to recuperate, and must have a beautiful environment. There must be a certain green area, and there must be good ventilation and ventilation equipment. The ward must occupy the best place in the courtyard on the sunny side, while the staff office can occupy the second place, and the proportion of the area should not be too large. At the same time, the ward must be divided into grades according to the needs of the disease. In order to implement prevention first, we must pay attention to the rational treatment of hospital sewage and prevent intra- and extra-hospital infections. In order to save materials, it is advocated to use laboratory utensils centrally, etc.

    Comrade Bobov often said: "It is an unparalleled honor for a Soviet citizen to participate in the construction work of the People's China." Therefore, he can gloriously complete the task entrusted to him by the Soviet people to help the Chinese people, and directly teach us many advanced experiences of Soviet health work. We health workers, in addition to sincerely thanking the Soviet government and Comrade Bobov for their assistance, must continue to work hard to learn from the Soviet Union and from Comrade Bobov.

    苏联专家保保夫同志给我们的帮助
    李华清
    三年来，东北的卫生工作，在党的正确领导下，在学习苏联和苏联专家的亲切耐心的帮助下开展起来了，而且获得了辉煌的成就。在工作中，苏联医学专家保保夫同志对我们的帮助是很大的，而且是多方面的。不问在贯彻国家卫生工作方针和开展医疗预防工作上，他使我们学习了许多先进的经验，少走了许多弯路。
    保保夫同志曾经给我们提出：“乡村卫生工作，决定于卫生机构。因此，乡村医生要明白治疗，也要会做组织工作。”这是他首先考虑到我们乡村中广大劳动人民的保健问题。在东北乡村卫生工作的重点实验工作中，保保夫同志，更给了我们极大的帮助。例如沈阳西十五公里的沙岭区卫生实验所，就是在他的亲自帮助下而建立起来的。在该所建立的前后，保保夫同志曾经三番五次地亲自到该区，协助选择地址以及筹划其他事宜。
    我们东北区继一九五○年四十个卫生实验县之后，又开辟了十二个卫生实验县，建立了五十个新型区卫生所，进行了重点的实验。这些工作是在保保夫同志的直接帮助下进行的。
    三年来，东北广大农村的卫生组织，在这些卫生实验县的推动和影响下，有了蓬勃发展。至一九五二年上半年止，全东北的县旗，已有百分之九十四点六有了县卫生院或县立医院，比一九四九年增加了百分之四○点二；区卫生所比一九四九年增加了百分之一七八一点四，占全东北的农村区数百分之六二点二，部分县区已发展到村一级，中心村卫生所和村卫生站已达八四○个。这些成绩，都是与保保夫同志的帮助相关联的。
    在医疗预防机构发展方向上，保保夫同志更告诉我们要争取实行“地区制”和“医师区制”。这样才能不因机构的重叠而浪费人力，才能在目前卫生人员不足的情况下，以最少的人力发挥最大的效能；这样也才能更好地贯彻“预防为主”。这个建议是很重要的。仅以东北工业部系统为例，在大连就有几个管理局所属的二、三十个工厂，各厂又都有自己的卫生所，甚至机械七厂和二十厂的厂部，同在
    一个楼里，而各有各的卫生所。这些卫生所，每天只能看几个门诊患者，不能解决更大的问题。如果统一起来，以现有人员组织医院，在人力和时间上都能有所节省。因此，我们就接受这个意见，将鞍山市与鞍钢的卫生工作，以及将抚顺市和抚顺矿务局的卫生工作，减去了工作中许多重叠以及步骤不一致的现象。
    在贯彻“预防为主”的方针上，保保夫同志的看法：单纯认为预防只是防止传染病的发生是不对的；对劳动者有了照顾和观察也是预防，对衣、食、住注意也是预防，关怀儿童的身体发育、定期的检查劳动者的身体、提倡体育，也是预防。同时早期发现病人、早期诊断、用新的疗法治疗病人，也是预防工作的内容。为了完成上述的任务，治疗医师，仅仅做治疗工作，而对病人的衣、食、住不进行调查，不经常来观察病人的生活情况，是不对的。这些有益的启发，对我们的工作及医务人员的帮助很大。
    在医疗方面，保保夫同志也根据苏联的先进经验，给我们介绍营养、理疗等疗法。大家知道过去我们对理疗工作上是不够重视的；自此部分医院和疗养院已开始建立理疗设备，进行泥疗、水疗、电疗、光疗、热疗等工作，收到了一定的成果。因此提高了治疗率。当然保保夫同志不光是嘴讲，并且也亲自帮助中国医大附属医院建立和改进了新的理疗科，协助培养了理疗工作干部。这给我们在理疗工作的开展上建立了良好的基础。
    东北的医疗机构大多数存在着重视门诊不重视病房，重视工作人员占用的房间而不重视病室，以及缺乏必要的住院处、卫生厨房等现象。保保夫同志针对着这些情况，给我们提出了首先在医院里建立住院处、卫生厨房的建议。目前在省市一级以上的医院已建立卫生厨房二十个，住院处十八个。扭转了卫生人员不重视厨房工作反而认为这是总务工作人员的责任的思想；同时也改变了过去只讲口味不讲营养价值的饭馆式的作风，因而提高了卫生人员对营养疗法的重视。
    随着国家的经济建设，几年来东北曾经进行了部分医疗设施的基本建设工作。在基本建筑的设计上，保保夫同志更协助我们制定一系列的合乎科学的设计标准并亲手培养了设计干部，使东北的医疗设施的设计工作有了基础，走向了既科学又实用的道路。
    在设计当中保保夫同志特别强调的是：“一切为了病人”，“处处贯彻预防为主”的方针；明确而彻底地批判医疗设施设计中的资产阶级观点。人民大众的医疗设施的设计工作必须既重视门诊又特别重视病房，因为病房是病人比较长期住院休养的地方，必须有优美的环境。要有一定绿化地带，要有良好的通风换气设备。病房必须在阳面占院房内最好的地方，而工作人员办公室可以占次的地方，而且面积的比例也不要太大。同时，必须按病情的需要而划分病室的等级。为了贯彻预防为主又必须注意医院的下水的合理处理，注意院内外感染的防止。为了节省物资在化验用具上主张集中使用等。
    保保夫同志经常这样讲：“做一个苏联公民能够参加人民中国的建设工作是一件无上光荣的事。”因此，他能光荣地完成了苏联人民所交给他帮助中国人民的任务，直接地教给我们许多苏联保健工作的先进经验。我们卫生工作者，除了衷心地感谢苏联政府和保保夫同志给我们的帮助之外，还要继续努力向苏联学习，向保保夫同志学习。
