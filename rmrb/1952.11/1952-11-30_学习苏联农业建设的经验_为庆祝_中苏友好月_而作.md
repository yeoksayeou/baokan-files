    Learning from the Soviet Union's Agricultural Construction Experience
    — Written to celebrate "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month"
    Zhang Linchi
    The glorious victory of the Great October Socialist Revolution initiated a new era in human history, and the first socialist country in the world, the Soviet Union, emerged. At the same time, it opened up a new socialist path for agriculture, the path guided by Lenin and Stalin. For thirty-five years, under the leadership of the Party of Lenin and Stalin, the Soviet people have built the world's most advanced socialist agriculture with unprecedented speed, creating brilliant and outstanding achievements and extremely rich advanced experience. Learning from this experience to strengthen and improve our current agricultural construction work is of great significance to our country's upcoming large-scale economic construction.
    Before the October Revolution, agriculture in Tsarist Russia was extremely backward. Poor and middle peasants, who accounted for 85 percent of the rural population, owned only less than 37 percent of the land. Under the exploitation and oppression of aristocratic landlords, they lived in poverty and hunger. Agricultural technology was primitive, and agricultural production was very low.
    The Great October Socialist Revolution fundamentally changed the situation in the countryside. On the first day after the victory, the "Land Decree" was passed at the Second Congress of Soviets, declaring land nationalized, thereby laying the foundation for agricultural collectivization. By the end of 1918, there were more than 1,000 collective farms of various forms across the country. In 1921, the number increased tenfold. In 1927, the 15th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) adopted the decision to fully launch the transition to collective farms. In 1929, socialist industry had achieved unprecedented development. The number of collective farms surged to 57,000. State-owned machine tractor stations were also established, nearly 100 of them. State-owned farms reached more than 3,000 in the previous year. Moreover, thanks to years of unremitting educational work by the Party in the countryside, that is to say, economically and politically, mature conditions were prepared for full collectivization. Therefore, from this time on, a huge transformation began with a large number of individual farmers moving towards collectivization. By 1932, when the first five-year plan was nearing completion, more than 60 percent of the peasant households had established more than 200,000 collective farms.
    In 1933 and 1935, two All-Union Congresses of Collective Farm Shock Workers were held, and the fundamental law of Soviet collective farms, the "Standard Charter of Agricultural Labor Cooperatives," was adopted. In 1938, the number of peasant households participating in collective farms accounted for 93.5 percent of the total number of peasant households. Regarding this great achievement, Comrade Stalin pointed out at the 18th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks): "The socialist economic system has become the sole form of our agriculture."
    By 1941, before the Great Patriotic War, there were more than 240,000 collective farms, more than 4,000 state-owned farms, and more than 7,000 machine tractor stations in the Soviet Union. This strong production force became one of the indestructible strongholds of socialism, playing a decisive role in the glorious victory of the Great Anti-Fascist War.
    After the war, the Soviet Union carried out huge restoration work, rapidly healing the wounds of the war. In 1950, a movement to merge small collective farms into large collective farms was launched, further promoting the development of agricultural productive forces, thereby advancing towards a communist society with healthy strides.
    The development path of Soviet agriculture tells us so clearly that socialist construction cannot be built simultaneously on two different foundations: the most massive and concentrated socialist industry and the most scattered and backward small commodity peasant economy. Without industrialization, there is no collectivization; without collectivization, there can be no fully consolidated socialist construction. Therefore, only after agricultural collectivization can agricultural production break away from its backward economic category, and only then can socialist society be consolidated. The Short Course of the History of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) points out: "This is a most profound revolution, a sudden change from the old qualitative state of society to the new qualitative state, and in terms of its results, it is of equal significance to the October Revolution of 1917." (Moscow Chinese Edition, page 375)
    It must be known that the process of agricultural collectivization is a long and complex revolutionary process. Only under the leadership of the working class can the victory of the socialist revolution in the countryside be guaranteed. Chairman Mao also instructed us: "The serious problem is to educate the peasants. The peasant economy is dispersed. According to the experience of the Soviet Union, it takes a long time and careful work to achieve agricultural socialization." (On People's Democratic Dictatorship, People's Publishing House Edition, page 15) Therefore, we must carry out long-term and persistent political education among the peasant masses, and we must also conduct demonstration education to the peasants through state-owned farms and collective farms that have already been organized, so that they can specifically recognize the superiority of socialist collectivized large-scale production. But it must also be known that the development of Soviet collective farms was carried out in the sharp class struggle with the exploiting classes, strictly adhering to the principle of voluntariness, from less to more, from small to large, from low-level to high-level. Today, our agricultural production cooperatives are a primary form of collective farms. Therefore, developing, consolidating, and improving labor mutual aid groups, and steadily running agricultural production cooperatives well, is one of our current major tasks.
    The superiority of socialist agriculture is fully manifested in the continuous increase in Soviet crop yields. The new post-war five-year plan (1946-1950) placed huge demands on agriculture: grain, raw cotton, and livestock, etc., had to be restored and surpass pre-war (1940) production levels. This arduous and glorious task has already been successfully completed. In 1949, the total grain output was close to the planned figure at the end of the five-year plan. The output in 1950 increased by 340 million poods compared to the pre-war 1940 output. The total grain harvest in 1952 will further increase to 8 billion poods (Editor's note: one pood equals 32.6 market catties), exceeding the highest annual level before the October Revolution by 66 percent. The output of raw cotton in 1951 exceeded the pre-war level by 46 percent, and other industrial raw material crops also greatly exceeded the pre-war level.
    The productive forces of socialist agriculture are developing so astonishingly and vigorously, which forms a sharp contrast with the shrinking of capitalist agriculture. According to the latest Yearbook of the US Department of Agriculture: Compared with 1948, the harvest of US crops in 1949 decreased by 4.7 million tons of wheat and 12 million tons of feed crops. The sown area of winter wheat in 1950 decreased by 19.5 percent compared to 1949.
    Why has the output of socialist agriculture been so rapidly increased? One of the decisive conditions is the widespread adoption of machine operation, and only in the large-scale agricultural production of socialist collectivization can machines be used so widely. In 1940, the scope of machine operation used by Soviet collective farms was limited to 90 types of work, but by 1951, it had increased to more than 170 types. At the same time, the mechanization was mainly on plowing and partial sowing and harvesting before the war, but today, not only has the degree of mechanization of all tillage of grain crops and industrial raw material crops been improved, but machines have also been quite commonly used in other agricultural sectors, such as improving grasslands and pastures, preparing feed for livestock, milking cows, shearing sheep, planting shelterbelts, building ponds and irrigation canals, etc. The degree of agricultural mechanization in the Soviet Union has reached 82 percent, and tillage work has been completely mechanized.
    Due to the widespread use of machine operation in socialist large-scale agricultural production, not only has the intensity of people's physical labor been reduced, but also the efficiency of labor production has been improved. But should these basic means of production, which play a decisive role in the development of production, belong to the state or the collective farms? Comrade Stalin, in his recently published document "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR" (Reply to Comrades Sanina and Wensher), clearly pointed out that concentrating the basic means of agricultural production in the hands of the state, that is, concentrating them in the hands of machine tractor stations, is the only way to guarantee the high-speed increase in the production of collective farms. The main source of the productive forces of socialist agriculture lies in modern science and technology, mainly in various machines that serve production. These machines are constantly being improved day by day. For example, recently the Soviet Union is going to eliminate hundreds of thousands of wheeled tractors and replace them with crawler tractors; to eliminate tens of thousands of old combine harvesters and replace them with new types of combine harvesters and other machines for operating industrial raw material crops. This will cost billions of rubles. If this large batch of new-style machines is sold to collective farms, in addition to this huge burden, it will inevitably seriously reduce the speed of production of collective farms. First, it will make collective farms the owners of basic means of production, and this collective farm ownership is even farther from the principle of all-people ownership of communism; second, it will expand the scope of commodity circulation, which will only hinder our progress towards communism. Therefore, all basic means of agricultural production must be owned by the state and cultivated for collective farms through state-owned machine tractor stations, thereby guaranteeing the realization of the state production plan of collective farms. In the Soviet Union, the operation of machines in agriculture has promoted agricultural collectivization in the past, and today it consolidates and develops the collective farm economy and moves towards the road of communism. This brilliant and arduous development process and development direction are a great inspiration to us. Now our agricultural production, due to being organized, has created good conditions for the use of new-style agricultural implements; and the superiority of new-style agricultural implements over animal-drawn agricultural implements promotes the consolidation and improvement of mutual aid and cooperation, and gradually moves towards collectivization. The state-owned machine tractor stations that we are currently experimenting with are the beginning of further development.
    It must be known that only under the socialist system, only under the conditions of agricultural collectivization and mechanization, can advanced agricultural science and technology be more widely used. The specific situation in the Soviet Union is precisely this: advanced production experience and scientific achievements are constantly emerging and are effectively and rapidly promoted. Several important production technologies, such as autumn deep plowing, seed inspection and disinfection, etc., are also implemented into various state-owned farms and collective farms in the form of laws. Advanced Soviet agricultural scientists, led by Lysenko, creatively carried forward the progressive Michurin science. In the great Soviet era, plant breeders have successively cultivated more than 3,000 varieties of excellent crops, making a large number of areas that were originally unsuitable for cultivation into abundant fields. In 1948, the Soviet Council of Ministers passed a resolution "On planting farmland protection forest belts, implementing grass-arable rotation system, and building ponds and reservoirs to ensure annual harvests in the grassland and forest-grassland areas of the European part of the Soviet Union." This historic resolution is praised as the great Stalin plan to conquer nature. The realization of this plan will make the development of socialist agriculture and its entire economy advance towards the road of communism by leaps and bounds. Therefore, we must not only humbly learn from the advanced science and technology of the Soviet Union, but also learn from their dialectical materialist scientific viewpoints and methods, and learn from their courage and spirit of conquering nature starting from reality.
    The victory of agricultural collectivization in the Soviet Union clearly pointed out the direction of advancement for us, but we should know that the road that the Soviet people have traveled is also an arduous road. The young Soviet government, in the constant and resolute struggle against the encirclement and interference of foreign imperialism and the conspiracy and sabotage of domestic White bandits and Trotskyites, overcame difficulties with incomparable confidence and effort, and won unprecedented victories in human history. Today, looking at the 35 years of struggle experience of the Soviet Union, our objective conditions are clearly more favorable than those of the Soviet Union in those years. What is particularly important is that we have the Soviet Union, a strong and loyal friend, who unselfishly introduces us to the experience they have gained through hard work. It has only been three years since the founding of the New China, and we have already successfully completed the task of the restoration stage in agriculture alone. This brilliant achievement is inseparable from the direct help of the Soviet people, especially Soviet experts. Moreover, this friendly help is only a beginning. On the road of transition from New Democracy to Socialism and towards Communism, the great Soviet people will always be our most loyal comrades-in-arms. Therefore, today, when we celebrate the 35th anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution, it is of extremely great significance for our country's agricultural workers and peasant brothers to enthusiastically launch a movement to learn from the Soviet Union's construction experience.

    学习苏联农业建设的经验
    ——为庆祝“中苏友好月”而作
    张林池
    伟大的十月社会主义革命的光荣胜利，在人类历史上创始了一个新纪元，在世界上出现了第一个社会主义国家——苏联。同时也为农业开辟了一条新的、社会主义的道路，列宁和斯大林所指引的道路。三十五年以来，苏联人民在列宁、斯大林党的领导下，以空前飞跃的速度，建设了全世界最先进的社会主义农业，创造了光辉卓越的成就和极其丰富的先进经验。学习这些经验，来加强与改进我们目前的农业建设工作，对于我国即将开始的大规模经济建设，有着极其重大的意义。
    在十月革命之前，帝俄的农业是极端落后的，占农村人口百分之八十五的贫农和中农，仅有着不足百分之三十七的土地。在贵族地主的剥削压迫下，过着贫困与饥饿的生活，农业技术是原始的，农业生产量也是很低的。
    伟大的十月社会主义革命，根本改变了农村的情况。胜利后的第一天，在第二次苏维埃代表大会上，通过了“土地法令”宣布土地国有。从而打下了农业集体化的基础。到一九一八年底，全国就有了各种不同形式的集体农庄一千多个；一九二一年，又增加了十倍。一九二七年联共（布）党第十五次代表大会，通过了全力展开向集体农庄过渡的决定。一九二九年，社会主义工业，已得到空前的发展，集体农庄激增到五万七千个，国营机器拖拉机站，也设立了将近一百个，国营农场前一年就达到了三千个以上。更由于党在农村中进行了多年不懈的教育工作，也就是说，在经济上和政治上，为全面集体化准备了成熟的条件，因此从这时候起，开始了一个大量个体农民走向集体化的巨大转变，到一九三二年，即第一个五年计划接近完成时，已有百分之六十以上的农户，建立了二十多万个集体农庄。
    一九三三年和一九三五年，召开了两次全苏集体农庄突击队员代表大会，通过了苏联集体农庄的根本大法“农业劳动组合标准章程”。一九三八年，参加集体农庄的农户，已占总农户数百分之九十三点五。对这一伟大的成就，斯大林同志在联共（布）党第十八次代表大会上指出：“社会主义经济体系已成为我国农业的唯一形式。”
    伟大的卫国战争前的一九四一年，全苏联已有了二十四万个以上的集体农庄，四千多个国营农场，和七千多个机器拖拉机站，这一雄厚的生产力量，成为不可摧毁的社会主义坚强堡垒之一，在伟大的反法西斯战争的光荣胜利中，发挥了决定性的作用。
    战后，苏联进行了巨大的恢复工作，迅速地医治了战争的创伤，一九五○年，又掀起了小集体农庄合并为大集体农庄的运动，更进一步地促进了农业生产力的发展，从而以健壮的步伐，朝着共产主义社会迈进。
    苏联农业的发展道路，是这样清楚地告诉我们：社会主义的建设事业，不可能同时建筑在最巨大集中的社会主义工业和最散漫落后的小商品农民经济的两种不同的基础上，没有工业化就没有集体化，没有集体化也就不可能有全部巩固的社会主义的建设。因此只有在农业集体化之后，农业生产才能脱离其落后的经济范畴，社会主义的社会也才能获得巩固。联共（布）党史简明教程指出：“这是一个极深刻的革命，是从社会的旧质态转变到新质态的突变，照其结果来说，它是与一九一七年十月革命具有同等意义的。”（莫斯科中文版，第三七五页）
    必须知道：农业集体化的过程，是一个长期的复杂的革命过程，只有在工人阶级的领导下，才能保证社会主义革命在农村中的胜利。毛主席也曾指示我们：“严重的问题是教育农民。农民的经济是分散的，根据苏联的经验，需要很长的时间和细心的工作，才能做到农业社会化。”（论人民民主专政，人民出版社版，第一五页）所以我们一定要在农民群众中进行长期的坚持不懈的政治教育，更要通过国营农场及已经组织起来的集体农庄，向农民进行示范教育，使他们能够具体地认识到社会主义集体化大生产的优越性。但也必须知道，苏联集体农庄的发展，是在严格地遵守着自愿的原则之下由少到多，由小到大，由低级到高级，而与剥削阶级的尖锐的阶级斗争中进行的。今天我们的农业生产合作社，就是集体农庄的一种初级形式。因此发展、巩固与提高劳动互助组，并稳步地办好农业生产合作社，是我们当前的主要任务之一。
    社会主义农业的优越性，充分地表现在苏联农作物产量的不断增加上。战后的新五年计划（一九四六——一九五○）对农业方面提出了巨大的要求：谷物、原棉和牲畜等，都要恢复并超过战前（一九四○）的生产水平，这一艰巨而光荣的任务，业已胜利地完成。一九四九年时，谷物的总产量即已接近五年计划结束时的计划数字，一九五○年的产量，比战前一九四○年的产量还增加了三亿四千万普特，一九五二年谷物的总收获量，更将增达八十亿普特（编者按：一普特合三二点六市斤），超过十月革命前最高年水平百分之六十六。一九五一年原棉的产量，超过战前水平百分之四十六，其他工业原料作物，也大大地超过了战前水平。
    社会主义农业的生产力，是这样惊人地蓬勃地发展着，它与资本主义农业的萎缩，形成了尖锐的对比。据最近美国农部年鉴所载：一九四九年美国农作物的收获量，与一九四八年相较，小麦减少四七○万吨，饲料作物减少一二○○万吨。一九五○年冬小麦的播种面积，比一九四九年减少了百分之一九点五。
    为什么社会主义农业的生产量会获得这样迅速的提高？决定性的条件之一，是普遍地采用了机器操作，也只有在社会主义集体化的大规模农业生产中，才能这样广泛地使用机器。一九四○年时，苏联集体农庄使用机器操作的范围，还只限于九十种工作，到一九五一年则增达一百七十种以上。同时，在战前主要的只是耕地和部分播种收割上的机械化，而今天则不仅提高了谷类作物、工业原料作物全部耕作机械化的程度，而且在其他的农业部门中，也相当普遍地运用了机器操作，如改良草地和牧场、为牲畜准备饲料、挤牛乳、剪羊毛、栽植护田林带、建筑池塘和灌溉水渠等。全苏农业机械化的程度，已达到百分之八十二，其中耕地工作已全部机械化。
    由于在社会主义的大规模的农业生产中，广泛地使用了机器操作的结果，不但减轻了人们体力劳动的强度，并且提高了劳动生产的效率。但是这些对发展生产起着决定性作用的基本生产工具，究竟应该属于国家呢，还是集体农庄呢？斯大林同志在最近发表的“苏联社会主义经济问题”（答萨宁娜和温什尔两同志）的文件中，明确地指出：把农业的基本生产工具，集中在国家的手中，也就是集中在机器拖拉机站的手中，是保证集体农庄生产高速度增加的唯一方法。社会主义农业生产力的主要源泉，在于现代化的科学技术，主要的是为生产服务的各种机器，这些机器是日新月异地不断改进着，例如最近苏联要把几十万架车轮式的拖拉机淘汰，代之以履带式的拖拉机；把几万架陈旧的联合机淘汰，代之以新型的联合机及其他为工业原料作物操作的机器，这样就要付出几十亿的卢布，假若将这一大批的新式机器，出售给集体农庄，则除了这一巨额的负担，势必严重地减低集体农庄生产的速度之外，第一就会使集体农庄成了基本生产工具的所有者，而这种集体农庄所有制与共产主义原则的全民所有制距离更远；第二就会扩大商品流通的活动范围，只会阻滞我们向共产主义前进。因此一切农业上的基本生产工具，必须属于国家所有，通过国营机器拖拉机站，而为集体农庄耕作，从而保证了集体农庄对国家生产计划的实现。苏联由于在农业上采取了机器的操作，过去是促进了农业的集体化，今天则巩固与发展着集体农庄经济，并向着共产主义的道路迈进。这一辉煌而艰巨的发展过程和发展方向，对于我们正是一个很大的启示。现在我们的农业生产，由于组织起来，为使用新式农具创造了良好的条件；而新式农具与马拉农具的优越性，又促进了互助合作的巩固与提高，逐步地走向集体化，目前我们所试办的国营机器拖拉机站，则是更进一步发展的开始。
    必须知道，只有在社会主义的制度之下，只有在农业集体化与机械化的条件之下，才能更广泛地运用先进的农业科学技术。苏联的具体情况正是这样：先进的生产经验与科学成果，不断地产生，并有效地迅速地进行推广，若干重要的生产技术如秋季深耕、种子检查和消毒等，还通过法令的形式，贯彻到各个国营农场与集体农庄。以李森科为首的先进的苏联农业科学家们，创造性地发扬了进步的米丘林科学，在伟大的苏维埃年代里，育种学家已先后培育出三千种以上的作物优良品种，使大量原来不适于栽培种植的地带，都成为丰盛的场圃。一九四八年，苏联部长会议通过了“关于种植农田防护林带，实行草田轮作制，建筑水塘和蓄水池以保证苏联欧洲部分草原区和森林草原区年年丰收”的决议。这一历史性的决议，被人们称颂为伟大的斯大林征服大自然的计划，这一计划的实现，将使社会主义农业及其全部经济的发展，向着共产主义的道路，大踏步前进。因此，我们不但要虚心地学习苏联先进的科学与技术，更要学习他们辩证唯物的科学观点与方法，学习他们从实际出发的征服大自然的勇气和精神。
    苏联农业集体化的胜利，为我们明确地指出了前进的方向，但是我们应该知道，苏联人民所走过的道路，也是一条艰巨的道路，年青的苏维埃政府，在不断地向国外帝国主义的包围干涉，国内白匪、托匪的阴谋破坏的坚决斗争中，以无比的信心与努力，克服了困难，争取了人类历史上空前的胜利。今天，从苏联三十五年的斗争经历来看，我们的客观条件，已显然地优厚于当年的苏联，尤其重要的是我们有着苏联这一强大而忠实的朋友，他们无私地将自己艰苦获得的经验，热忱地介绍给我们。新中国成立还只有三年，仅在农业方面，即已胜利地完成了恢复阶段的任务，这一辉煌的成就是与苏联人民，特别是苏联专家的直接帮助分不开的。而且，这种友好的帮助，还只是一个开始，在新民主主义过渡到社会主义，并向着共产主义前进的大道上，伟大的苏联人民，永远是我们最忠实的战友。因此，今天当我们庆祝伟大的十月社会主义革命三十五周年的时候，我们全国的农业工作者和农民兄弟热烈地掀起一个学习苏联建设经验的运动，是具有极其重大的意义的。
