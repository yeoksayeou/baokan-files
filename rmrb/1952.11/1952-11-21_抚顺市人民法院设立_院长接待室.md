    Fushun People's Court Establishes "President's Reception Room"
    Editor: In accordance with the spirit of the "Decision on Handling People's Letters and Receiving People" issued by the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government, the Fushun People's Court established a "President's Reception Room" in July of this year. The room has a fixed reception time of 2:00 PM to 6:00 PM every Friday, but also receives people who come at other times. After the president meets with the masses and talks to them, they are responsible for handling the opinions or problems raised. After doing this, the number of visiting masses has gradually increased. Many important issues have been seen in the conversations with the masses, which have promoted changes in the trial style of court staff and the timely handling of problems. The masses are very satisfied. An old worker said: "It really is the People's Court, it's completely different from the past." Some also said: "Communist Party cadres are good; when we have problems, they will find ways to solve them for us." This not only solves the problems of the people but also encourages the people to supervise the government. In particular, recently, the work of the "President's Reception Room" has provided a lot of material for the judicial reform movement. We believe that all courts of first instance or local organs of state power that are often in contact with the masses can try this approach. When starting this work, it is necessary to do a good job of publicity so that the masses can generally understand it. The Fushun People's Court has carried out publicity through newspapers, radio, and slideshows.

    抚顺市人民法院设立“院长接待室”
    编辑同志：抚顺市人民法院根据中央人民政府政务院“关于处理人民来信和接见人民工作的决定”的精神，自今年七月份起设立了“院长接待室”。该室暂以每星期五下午二时至六时为固定接待时间，临时来的也接见。院长接见群众谈话后，对所提出的意见或问题，都负责处理。这样做了以后，来访的群众日渐增多。从群众的谈话中，看到很多重要问题，对改变法院工作人员的审判作风和及时处理问题，都起了推动作用。群众很满意。一个老工人说：“真是人民法院，和过去啥都两样。”也有的说：“共产党干部好；咱有问题，就能给咱想法解决。”这样做，不但解决了人民群众的问题，同时也鼓励了人民监督政府。特别是最近，在“院长接待室”的工作中，为司法改革运动提供了许多材料。我们认为，凡是一审法院或常与群众发生联系的地方政权机关，都可以这样试行。开始作这一项工作时，必须作好宣传工作，使群众能普遍地了解。抚顺市人民法院曾经通过报纸、电台、幻灯等进行了宣传。  王熙政
