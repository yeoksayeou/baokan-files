    Heading Towards the World People's Peace Congress
    A declaration is posted on walls all over the world and is being carefully read and discussed by millions of men and women. This declaration says:
    “Things cannot go on like this,
    People can no longer endure a life of hardship, hatred, and terror,
    The slaughter must be stopped, the Cold War must be ended, and the independence and security of all countries must be guaranteed.
    The World People's Peace Congress will be a great gathering that will
    break through the terrible dead end and restore hope to mankind.
    Men and women all over the world, this congress is your own
    affair,
    What diplomats cannot do, the people must do.”
    This great World People's Peace Congress is scheduled to be held on December 12th in the Grand Concert Hall of Vienna, the capital of Austria (within the British occupation zone). More than two thousand representatives of peace-loving people from all over the world will attend this grand event. The congress will discuss how to save humanity’s most precious asset—peace.
    The World Peace Council's call in July this year for the convocation of the World People's Peace Congress has been enthusiastically responded to by countries around the world. This is because the congress is being convened under the following circumstances: the Korean War launched by the U.S. government has entered its third year; the countries of the capitalist system have been driven onto the path of expanding armaments and economic militarization by the U.S. government’s war policy; the unilateral peace treaty with Japan and the "General Treaty" with West Germany have been signed, and Japan and Germany, the two hotbeds of World War II, are being openly revived. Under this policy of the U.S. government, the national independence and state sovereignty of various countries have been wantonly violated, and the economic life of the people of various countries has been severely damaged. The consequences and crises of the U.S. government's policy of war and aggression for the whole world, and first and foremost for the countries of the capitalist system, are becoming increasingly clear. Under these circumstances, various social strata, political parties, trade unions, religious organizations, and peace organizations in the countries of the capitalist system all believe that a way out of the dead end must be found. This has made the social foundation of the world peace movement increasingly broad, thus making it possible to attract a large number of people who have not yet participated in the peace movement to participate in the peace movement.
    The enthusiastic response to the convening of the World People's Peace Congress comes from countries all over the world. The Asian and Pacific Peace Conference, held in Beijing, the capital of China, in October this year, with 367 representatives from 37 countries attending, represented the will of 1.6 billion people in Asia and the Pacific. It unanimously adopted the "Resolution on Supporting the Convocation of the World People's Peace Congress," and unanimously adopted resolutions and letters to the people of the world and to the United Nations on issues such as Japan, Korea, national independence, cultural exchange, economic exchange, women's rights and children's welfare, and intensifying the movement to strive for a Five-Power Peace Pact. Undoubtedly, these issues are also of concern to the World People's Peace Congress. Therefore, the Asian and Pacific Peace Conference is, in fact, an important step towards the World People's Peace Congress.
    The peace movements in Asia and the Pacific are expanding more widely under the encouragement of the successful Asian and Pacific Peace Conference. The Japanese Committee for the Defense of Peace and the Japanese Preparatory Committee for the Asian and Pacific Peace Conference jointly convened the All-Japan Peace Defense Conference from October 31st to November 1st. Japanese peace fighters Ikuo Oyama and Yoshitaro Hirano called on the Japanese people to take action, together with all peace-loving people in the world, to oppose the rearmament of Japan for the purpose of aggression, and to demand an end to the Korean War. The conference decided to send a delegation to attend the World People's Peace Congress. At the same time, nearly two million people have signed the signature campaign against conscription being held in Japan. This will greatly hit the implementation of the Japanese reactionaries' rearmament plan. In order to welcome the World People's Peace Congress, the Burmese people's peace organization launched another mass movement on November 1st in Yangon to collect signatures demanding a Five-Power Peace Pact, following the Asian and Pacific Peace Conference, and held a peace photo exhibition in the Shwedagon Pagoda in Yangon. At the same time, prominent figures from various religious circles in Burma jointly issued a declaration calling for peace and opposing war.
    In Latin American countries, the signature campaign demanding a peace pact is expanding. The Brazilian Committee for the Defense of Peace has set a goal of collecting six million signatures before the World People's Peace Congress in December; it has now collected more than 4.5 million signatures. Peace fighters in Chile have set a goal of collecting one million signatures. Peace organizations in Brazil, Venezuela, and Nicaragua have all selected a delegation including political figures, cultural, artistic, and literary workers, workers from different political parties, and representatives of different religious beliefs to attend the World People's Peace Congress. Colombia is the only country in Latin America to send troops to participate in the war of aggression against Korea. Therefore, the National Peace Committee of Colombia will launch a huge petition movement demanding the conclusion of a Five-Power Peace Pact and demanding the cessation of hostilities against Korea.
    In Canada, North America, a launching committee has been established in preparation for the World People's Peace Congress. In order to publicize the significance of the World Peace Congress more widely and deeply, peace advocates are holding household gatherings everywhere, distributing commemorative cards door-to-door to those who donate funds to the representatives attending the World People's Peace Congress. In addition, they are also visiting members of parliament, mayors, and religious figures, and engaging in discussions with them to win them over to participate in the World People's Peace Congress. At the same time, a poster competition on the theme of peace has been held in Toronto. In the United States, despite the suppression of the reactionary rulers, the American people are still holding a series of peace rallies and combining the peace movement with the movement to stop the war of aggression in Korea. Responding to the call of Paul Robeson, Dr. Du Bois, Professor Morrison, and other social celebrities, the American people are conducting a national referendum on immediately ending the Korean War.
    The same wave of peace is also surging in Europe. The opposition to the rearmament of West Germany, which is of concern to the people of Europe and the world, has become one of the most important contents of the world peace movement. Therefore, the "International Conference for a Peaceful Solution to the German Question" held in Berlin from November 8th to 11th became the most important preparatory step for the World People's Peace Congress in Europe. Representatives from twelve European countries, including Germany, Poland, Czechoslovakia, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, the United Kingdom, Italy, Austria, Switzerland, and Finland, attended the conference. The declaration adopted by the conference put forward an action program to prevent the ratification of the "General Treaty," to hold free, universal, direct, and equal elections throughout Germany to elect a German government, and to strive for the early conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany by the four major powers. In West Germany, more than 11 million people, accounting for about a quarter of the West German population, have voted against the "General Treaty" and demanded the conclusion of a just peace treaty. Germany will have about 150 representatives attending the World People's Peace Congress, of which 100 are West German representatives and about 50 are representatives of the German Democratic Republic. West German representatives will be elected at the peace conferences currently being held in various parts of West Germany. The representatives of the German Democratic Republic will be elected at the "Conference to Promote Mutual Understanding among the German People and Strive for a Just Peace Treaty" to be held in Berlin from November 28th to 29th of this year. Currently, peace conferences will be held in all 217 regions of East Germany to discuss the significance of the convening of the World People's Peace Congress and to elect representatives to attend the aforementioned conference.
    Neighboring France held a special meeting of the National Peace Council, calling on the French people to participate in the preparation for the World People's Peace Congress. Four hundred thousand cards printed with the major issues to be discussed at the World People's Peace Congress, each selling for ten francs, have been sold out. The French National Farmers' Peace Conference is also scheduled to be held on November 22nd. Everywhere you can see the impact of this conference on the vast French farmers. A well-known figure in the agricultural community said: "I have never participated in the peace movement, but this conference is truly a matter for all of us who cultivate the land." Discussions are taking place in villages large and small and in the most remote farmhouses, which will encourage farmers to unite with people from other strata to fight for the cause of peace. The French National Peace Committee recently issued a declaration appealing to American public opinion. The declaration explains why the French people oppose the American occupation, oppose making France lose its independence, and oppose the Marshall Plan, which has huge military expenditures that bankrupt foreign trade and paralyze the economy. It also asks the United States to send representatives to the World People's Peace Congress to jointly consult, seek understanding, and improve friendship. Fachie, chairman of the French National Peace Committee, also pointed out that striving for national independence has become the demand of all strata of the French people, and that defending peace will be an important guarantee of national independence.
    Italy, which has the same strong peace forces as France, is holding peace rallies everywhere. Many local rallies combine the opposition to the construction of bases by the United States in Italy with the peace movement. On November 8th, the Italian Peace Committee held a "Congress in Support of National Independence and National Sovereignty" in Verona, attended by hundreds of representatives from various regions of Italy. Congress representative Chiforotto condemned the Italian government for ceding military bases to the United States in his speech, pointing out that this was a move that threatened peace and sold out national sovereignty. The town of Ghedi in the province of Brescia held a "Peace and Independence Day" to protest the U.S. military's plan to build an airport in Ghedi. In the province of Forlì, thousands of men, women, and children occupied a piece of land originally intended by the government for the construction of a military airport, declaring: "Money should be used for peace, not for rearmament! We will never allow foreign soldiers to trample on our country!" The Italian Peace Committee has united nearly 20 million people to defend peace.
    In the United Kingdom, a launching committee has been established in preparation for the World People's Peace Congress. More than eighty well-known figures in the cultural, scientific, and industrial circles have joined the committee. Several gatherings and meetings have been held to select representatives to attend the congress, ensuring that a delegation with the widest possible representation will be selected. Although the Labor Party leadership has decided not to allow its members to participate in the World People's Peace Congress, there are still Labor Party members who are participating in or expressing support for the World People's Peace Congress. In the "Peace Handbook" issued by the British Launching Committee for the World People's Peace Congress, thousands of British citizens wrote down their opinions on the issue of ensuring world peace, and these opinions will be sorted out and submitted to the World People's Peace Congress. In order to promote peace and raise travel expenses for representatives to go abroad, peace advocates have asked people to purchase tickets sufficient to pay for five, ten, or twenty miles of travel, which has been very successful.
    In order to welcome the World People's Peace Congress, workers in Northern Europe held a peace conference in Oslo, the capital of Norway, on November 15th and 16th. Representatives from trade union organizations in Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Finland, and Iceland attended the meeting. They unanimously opposed the expansion of armaments and preparations for war, and demanded the maintenance of the independence of the Nordic countries, the improvement of living conditions, the protection of the political rights of working people, and friendly relations with the Soviet Union. The meeting called on workers in the Nordic countries to establish peace organizations everywhere to unite the working class and defend peace.
    Austria—the country where the World People's Peace Congress will be held—the working people are actively preparing for the World People's Peace Congress. Workers, farmers, artisans, office workers, small merchants, and housewives wholeheartedly welcome the convening of the World People's Peace Congress in Vienna. In enterprises and homes, gatherings and seminars are being held to discuss the resolutions of the World Peace Council and the struggle of the Austrian people against the United States' intensification of war preparations in western Austria.
    In the Middle East and Near East countries, the issue of peace has never been so closely linked to the issue of striving for national independence as it is today. The people of Syria and Lebanon said: "The Vienna Congress is being convened at a very appropriate time." Farmers' conferences focusing on discussing peace issues are being held. Women's organizations, workers' organizations, youth organizations, student organizations, and athletes' organizations are launching various visits and consultations to prepare for the World People's Peace Congress. Greek youth, regardless of the fascist government's terrorist suppression, are engaged in uniting all youth to oppose sending Greek youth to Korea to die, to oppose turning Greece into a large-scale military base, and to persist in the struggle to send representatives to Vienna. Furthermore, they are urging young people to form peace subcommittees and small groups in an organized manner throughout the country to promote the peace movement.

    走向世界人民和平大会
    一个宣言贴在全世界各地的墙壁上，正被千百万的男女认真地阅读和讨论着。这个宣言说：
    “不能这样继续下去，
    人们不能再忍受窘困、仇恨和恐怖的生活，
    必须制止屠杀，必须结束冷战，必须保证各国
    人民的独立和安全。
    世界人民和平大会将是一个伟大的集会，它将
    打通可怕的绝路，把希望还给人类。
    全世界的男女们，这个大会是你们自己的事
    情，
    外交家所办不到的事，人民必须办到。”
    这个伟大的世界人民和平大会定于十二月十二日在奥地利京城维也纳的大音乐堂（在英国占领区内）举行，代表全世界各国爱好和平的人民的两千多名代表将参加这个盛会。在这个大会上将讨论如何拯救人类最珍贵的财产——和平——的问题。
    世界和平理事会在今年七月发出的召开世界人民和平大会的号召，在世界各国获得了热烈的响应。这是因为这个大会是在这种局势下召开的：美国政府所发动的朝鲜战争已进入第三年，资本主义体系各国已被美国政府的战争政策驱上扩张军备和经济军事化的道路，片面的对日和约和对西德的“一般性条约”已经签订，日本和德国这两个第二次世界大战的温床正被公开复活起来；在美国政府的这种政策下，各国人民的民族独立和国家主权横遭侵犯，各国人民的经济生活，遭到严重的损害。美国政府的这种战争和侵略政策对于全世界，而首先是对于资本主义体系各国的后果和危机是愈来愈明显了。在这种局势下，资本主义体系各国的各社会阶层，各政治党派、工会、宗教团体，以及和平组织，都认为必须从绝路中找到出路。这就使世界保卫和平运动的社会基础越来越扩大，因而使吸引广大的尚未参加和平运动的人们参加和平运动成为可能。
    对于召开世界人民和平大会的热烈响应来自全世界各国。今年十月间在中国首都北京召开的、有三十七个国家的三百六十七位代表出席的亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议，代表了亚洲及太平洋各国的十六亿人民的意志，全体一致地通过了“关于拥护召开世界人民和平大会的决议”，并全体一致地通过了关于日本问题、朝鲜问题、民族独立问题、文化交流、经济交流问题、妇女权利与儿童福利、加紧争取五大国缔结和平公约运动等项决议和告世界人民书及致联合国书。无疑地，这些问题也是世界人民和平大会所关心的问题。因此亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议，事实上是走向世界人民和平大会的一个重要步骤。
    亚洲及太平洋各国的和平运动，在亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议胜利成功的鼓舞下，正在更加广泛地展开。日本拥护和平委员会和亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议日本筹备委员会在十月三十一日到十一月一日联合召开了全日本拥护和平大会。日本和平战士大山郁夫与平野义太郎号召日本人民采取行动，与世界一切爱好和平人民一道，反对为了进行侵略而重新武装日本，要求结束朝鲜战争。这个会议决定派遣代表团出席世界人民和平大会。同时在日本举行的反对征兵的签名运动，截至目前，已有将近二百万人签名。这将大大地打击日本反动派的重新武装计划的实行。缅甸人民的和平组织为了迎接世界人民和平大会，在亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议之后，十一月一日在仰光再一次展开了征集要求五大国缔结和平公约签名的群众运动，并在仰光大金塔内举行保卫和平图片展览会。与此同时，缅甸各宗教界著名人士联名发表了呼吁和平、反对战争的宣言。
    在拉丁美洲各国，要求缔结和平公约的签名运动正在扩大。巴西保卫和平委员会已经订出了要在十二月世界人民和平大会召开以前征集六百万人签名的目标；现在已经征集了四百五十多万签名。智利的和平战士们订出了征集一百万签名的目标。巴西、委内瑞拉和尼加拉瓜等国的和平组织，都选派了一个包括不同政党的政治人物、文化、艺术、文学工作者、工人及不同宗教信仰的代表团，出席世界人民和平大会。哥伦比亚是拉丁美洲唯一派遣军队参加侵朝战争的国家，因此哥伦比亚全国和平委员会将展开一个巨大的请愿运动，要求订立五大国和平公约，要求停止对朝鲜的敌对行动。
    在北美洲的加拿大，为着筹备世界人民和平大会，
    一个发起委员会已经成立。为了更广泛更深入地宣传世界和平大会的意义，和平拥护者在各地举行住户集会，逐家逐户地分发纪念卡片给那些捐献经费给出席世界人民和平大会代表的人。此外并访问国会议员、市长和宗教界人士，和他们进行讨论，争取他们参加世界人民和平大会。与此同时，以和平作题材的招贴画比赛已在多伦多进行。在美国，尽管有反动统治者的镇压，美国人民仍举行了一连串的和平集会，并且把和平运动与停止在朝鲜的侵略战争运动结合起来。响应保罗·罗伯逊、杜波依斯博士、摩里逊教授和其他社会名流的号召，美国人民正在进行关于立即结束朝鲜战争的全民投票。
    同样的和平浪潮也在欧洲澎湃着。欧洲和全世界人民都关心地反对西德重新武装问题，已成为世界和平运动的最重要的内容之一。因此，十一月八日到十一日在柏林召开的“国际争取和平解决德国问题会议”就成了世界人民和平大会在欧洲方面的最重要的准备步骤。出席这次会议的有德国、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、法国、比利时、荷兰、卢森堡、英国、意大利、奥地利、瑞士和芬兰等十二个欧洲国家的代表。这个会议通过的宣言中，提出了阻止批准“一般性条约”，举行全德自由、普遍、直接和平等的选举，来选举德国政府，争取四大国早日缔结对德和约等项行动纲领。在西德已有一千一百多万人，即约占西德人口四分之一的居民投票反对
    “一般性条约”，要求缔结公正的和约。德国将约有一百五十位代表参加世界人民和平大会，其中有
    一百人是西德代表，约五十人是德意志民主共和国代表。西德代表将在目前西德各地举行的和平会议上选出。德意志民主共和国的代表将于本年十一月二十八日至二十九日在柏林举行的“促进德国人民相互了解和争取缔结公正和约大会”上选出。目前在全东德的二百一十七个地区都将举行和平会议，来讨论世界人民和平大会召开的意义，并选出代表参加上述的大会。
    与德国相邻的法国举行了全国和平理事会特别会议，号召法国人民参加世界人民和平大会的筹备工作。四十万张印有世界人民和平大会要讨论的重大议题的卡片，每张售十个法郎，已经售完。法国全国农民和平会议也定于十一月二十二日召开。到处都可以看到这次会议在广大的法国农民中所引起的影响。一个农业界著名人士说：“我从未参加过和平运动，但这次大会真正是我们所有耕种土地的人们的事情。”各大小村庄以及最偏僻的农庄中均展开讨论，它将鼓励农民与其他各阶层人民联合起来为和平事业进行斗争。法国全国和平委员会最近发出一个向美国公共舆论呼吁的宣言。宣言中解释为什么法国人民要反对美国占领，反对使法国失去独立，反对使对外贸易破产与经济瘫痪的军事支出浩大的马歇尔计划。并要求美国派遣代表出席世界人民和平大会，来共同协商，求得了解，改善友谊。法国全国和平委员会主席法奇并指出：争取民族独立已经成为法国各阶层人民的要求，而保卫和平将是民族独立的重要保证。
    与法国有着同样强大和平力量的意大利，各地都在举行和平集会，许多地方的集会都把反对美国在意大利建筑基地与和平运动结合起来。十一月八日，意大利和平委员会在味罗那召开了一个“拥护民族独立和国家主权大会”，参加大会的有来自意大利各地区的几百个代表。大会代表齐佛罗托在发言中谴责意大利政府出让军事基地给美国，指出这是威胁了和平并出卖了国家主权的举动。布利西亚省盖地亚地方曾举行“和平与独立日”，抗议美军打算在盖地亚建筑机场。在福利省，成千的男女和小孩占据了一块原来政府用来建筑军事机场的土地，他们宣称：“钱应当用于和平，不应当用于重新武装！我们决不让外国兵蹂躏我们的国家！”意大利和平委员会已经团结了将近两千万人民，来保卫和平。
    在英国，为了筹备世界人民和平大会，成立了一个发起委员会。八十多个文化、科学和实业界的著名人士参加了这个委员会。为了选派出席大会的代表，已举行了若干集会和会议，保证要选出具有最广泛代表性的代表团。尽管工党领导机关决议不许它的党员参加世界人民和平大会，但是仍有工党分子参加或表示支持世界人民和平大会。在世界人民和平大会英国发起委员会所印发的“和平手册”中，成千的英国公民写上他们对于确保世界和平的问题的意见，这些意见都将经过整理后，提交给世界人民和平大会。为了宣传和平和募集代表出国的旅费，和平拥护者们请人民购买一种足够付五里、十里或二十里旅费的票子，已经有了很大成绩。
    北欧的工人为了迎接世界人民和平大会，于十一月十五日和十六日在挪威首都奥斯陆举行了和平会议。出席会议的有挪威、瑞典、丹麦、芬兰和冰岛的工会组织代表。他们一致反对扩军备战，要求维护北欧国家的独立，提高生活条件，保卫劳动人民的政治权利和对苏友好。会议号召北欧各国工人在各地建立和平组织，来团结工人阶级，保卫和平。
    奥地利——世界人民和平大会会址所在的国家，劳动人民正在积极筹备世界人民和平大会。工人、农民、手艺工人、机关职员、小商人和家庭妇女衷心地欢迎世界人民和平大会在维也纳召开。在企业和家庭中，都在举行集会和座谈会，讨论世界和平理事会的决议以及奥地利人民进行斗争反对美国在奥地利西部加紧作战准备的问题。
    在中东、近东各国中，和平问题从没有像今天这样与争取民族独立问题密切地联系着。叙利亚和黎巴嫩的人民说：“维也纳的大会是在一个很适当的时候召开的。”以讨论和平问题为主的农民会议正在召开。妇女组织，工人组织，青年组织，学生组织，及运动员组织，均展开各种访问、协商运动，以筹备世界人民和平大会。希腊的青年，不顾法西斯政府的恐怖镇压，正从事于团结所有青年反对派遣希腊青年到朝鲜送死、反对把希腊变成一个大规模的军事基地、和坚持派代表到维也纳去的斗争。并且他们正以一种有组织的方法，敦促青年人在全国各地成立和平小组会和小团体，来推动和平运动。
