    Celebrating the Victorious Opening of the Tanggu New Port
    Zhang Bojun, Minister of Communications of the Central People's Government, Chairman of the Tanggu Port Construction Committee
    The Tanggu New Port, which has been the focus of attention of the people of the whole country, has now been victoriously opened after completing the first phase of port construction. That is to say, from October 17th, ten-thousand-ton freighters have been able to enter the port with the tide and dock to load and unload goods. This is another great victory for the people of our great motherland under the glorious and correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Central People's Government, and the wise leadership of Chairman Mao in the process of new democratic construction.
    As everyone knows, Mr. Sun Yat-sen had the ideal of building a "large northern port," but that was just a distant ideal written in books. After the Japanese imperialists invaded our country, in order to facilitate the control of North China and plunder the rich mineral and agricultural products of North China, they started construction of a new port at the Haihe estuary in Tanggu, but it was never completed. After the surrender of the Japanese invaders, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang not only did not add any repairs, but on the contrary, carried out large-scale criminal theft and destruction of the materials and projects in the port. In fact, the port was already in a state of disrepair when it was liberated.
    However, in reality, after only fifteen months since liberation, the far-reaching ideal has become a reality.
    The State Council of the Central People's Government decided in August of last year to formally construct the Tanggu New Port. The original plan was for the first phase of the project to be completed by the end of 1952, so that ten-thousand-ton freighters could be berthed and docked. All the staff and workers of our new port, under the correct planning leadership and inspired by patriotic enthusiasm, brought into play their great labor creation power, and with the help of Soviet experts, absorbed advanced experience and technical standards, so that this great project was completed more than two months ahead of schedule.
    In order to solve the main difficulties in port construction, and in order to solve the problem of dredgers, all the workers and cadres carried out selfless labor, salvaged and repaired more than two hundred dredgers and other engineering vessels sunk by the Chiang bandits, ensuring the smooth progress of the port construction project. In October of last year, a vigorous patriotic port construction labor saving campaign was launched throughout the port. The workers and other staff put forward 1,949 rationalization proposals, of which 1,108 were adopted and implemented. This not only quickly eliminated all difficulties and obstacles in the project, but also greatly improved work efficiency as a result of improved labor organization and operating methods and rational use of machinery and tools. The greatest and most numerous difficulties were encountered in the project of rebuilding the wharf, but they were overcome one by one under the workers' rationalization proposals. For example, in the pile driving and tie rod installation project for wharf reinforcement, a three-ton steam hammer was initially used to drive wooden piles. After driving 20,000 times, only one pile was barely driven in a week. At this rate, the tie rod installation task would not be completed in two years. In order to accelerate this project, the staff and workers successively put forward nine rationalization proposals, which resulted in an increase in pile driving efficiency from one pile per week to eighteen piles per day; the tie rod installation project also increased from one per week to fourteen per day. From May to the present, as many as 1,280 new records of various kinds have emerged. The time for shifting anchors and stopping the Tanggu No. 4 dredger was reduced from one hour and fifty minutes before liberation to four minutes. Tanggu No. 5 even created a new record of not stopping the shifting of anchors, which enabled each Tanggu dredger to increase 200 hours of dredging time per year, increase 127,000 cubic meters of dredging volume, and save 36,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity. With the enthusiastic help of Soviet experts, the concentration of sediment discharge was quickly raised to the advanced level of the Soviet Union, and the number of cubic meters of dredging per hour was also increased by 100% to 150% compared with before.
    As a result of all the workers adopting the attitude of masters towards the cause of national construction and resolutely fighting against various difficulties day and night, regardless of severe cold and scorching sun, in the short period of fifteen months, 16,954,379 cubic meters of earthwork were excavated.
    (Equivalent to digging a canal from Beijing to Tianjin, 35 meters wide and 4 meters deep), 100,0594 cubic meters of rock were dumped, 44,869 square meters of slopes were built, and the first wharf with a depth of minus 6 meters and 700 meters long was rebuilt into a deep-water wharf with a depth of minus 8.5 meters. After such great efforts, we finally successfully completed the arduous and glorious first phase of the port construction task, and greatly shortened the working hours, saving the country more than 14 billion yuan in investment, and overfulfilling the plan by 12%, thus opening the port more than two months ahead of schedule.
    The Tanggu New Port is not only close to the largest economic center in North China—Tianjin—but also backed by the capital of our motherland, Beijing, and behind it are the extremely resource-rich provinces of North China and Northwest China. In the past, the import and export trade of North China mainly relied on the port of Tianjin, but the port of Tianjin was a narrow river port that could only accommodate small ships of about 1,000 tons. Large ships of more than 3,000 tons had to anchor at sea, and the loading and unloading of goods mainly relied on barges for long-distance barging. The opening of Tanggu New Port not only opens up broad outlets for the abundant products of North China and promotes the economic development of the whole country, especially the North China region; and we are convinced that, due to the success of the Moscow International Economic Conference, especially the victory of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference held in Beijing this time, the possibility of our people and the people of other countries carrying out peaceful trade has been greatly enhanced. This peaceful commercial port built by our peace-loving people with selfless labor—Tanggu New Port—will undoubtedly contribute to promoting the development of international peaceful trade.
    When we celebrate the birth of the people's new port, let us express our heartfelt thanks and warm congratulations to Chairman Mao and the wise leadership of the Central People's Government, the great support of the people of the whole country and various agencies, the enthusiastic help and guidance of Soviet experts, and the hard work of all the staff and workers who directly participated in the port construction! At the same time, we hope that on the basis of the glorious achievements of the first phase of the project, we will continue to complete the construction project with renewed vigor, achieve more and greater achievements, and welcome the construction upsurge of our great motherland!

    庆贺塘沽新港胜利开港
    中央人民政府交通部部长塘沽建港委员会主任委员  章伯钧
    为全国人民所关注的塘沽新港，在完成了第一期建港任务之后，现在已胜利开港了；就是说，从十月十七日起，万吨轮船即乘潮入港，停靠码头装卸货物了。这是我们伟大祖国的人民在光荣的正确的中国共产党、中央人民政府毛主席的英明领导下，在新民主主义建设过程中的又一个伟大胜利。
    大家知道，当年孙中山先生曾有建设“北方大港”的理想，但那仅仅是写在书本中的遥远理想。日本帝国主义入侵我国后，为了便于控制华北，尽性掠夺华北丰饶的矿藏和农产品，曾在塘沽海河口动工建筑新港，但始终没有完成。日寇投降后，蒋介石匪帮不仅未加丝毫修建，相反地却对港内的物资和工程，进行了大规模的罪恶的盗窃和破坏，事实上该港在解放时已经破坏不堪了。
    然而解放之后实际上只经过十五个月的时间，远大的理想就变成现实了。
    中央人民政府政务院于去年八月决定正式修建塘沽新港。原定第一期工程在一九五二年年底完成，使万吨轮船可停泊靠岸。我们新港全体职工在正确的计划领导和爱国热情的鼓舞下，发挥出伟大的劳动创造力量，同时在苏联专家们的帮助下，吸收先进经验和技术标准，使这一伟大工程提前两个多月完成了。
    为了解决建港中的主要困难，为了解决挖泥船的问题，全体工人和干部进行了忘我的劳动，先后打捞和修复了二百余艘被蒋匪击沉的挖泥船和其他工程用船，保证了建港工程的顺利进行。去年十月，全港开展了轰轰烈烈的爱国建港劳动节约竞赛运动，工人们及其他工作人员所提出的合理化建议达
    一千九百四十九件，其中有一千一百零八件被采纳实行。这样不仅迅速地排除了工程中一切的困难和障碍，而且由于改进了劳动组织和操作方法以及合理使用机具的结果，大大提高了工作效率。在改建码头的工程中，碰到的困难最大也最多，但都在工人合理化的建议下被逐一地克服了。例如在码头加固中的打桩和穿拉杆工程，开始用三吨重的汽锤打木桩，连打二万下，一个星期才勉强打入一根，这样，两年也完成不了穿打任务。为了加速这一工程，职工们连续提出了九种合理化建议，结果使打桩效率由一星期一根提高到一天十八根；穿拉杆工程也由一星期一根提高到一天十四根。仅从五月起到现在已涌现出各种新纪录一千二百八十件之多。塘沽四号挖泥船由解放前移锚一次停车一小时五十分钟缩短为四分钟，塘沽五号更创造移锚不停车的新纪录，这就使得每只塘沽号挖泥船一年增加二百小时的挖泥时间，增加十二万七千立方公尺的挖泥量，省电三万六千瓩时。在苏联专家的热心帮助下，排泥浓度也很快地提高到苏联的先进水平，每小时的挖泥方数较之以前也提高了百分之一百到一百五十。
    由于全体工人对于祖国建设事业采取了主人翁的态度，不分严寒暴日，日以继夜地和各种困难进行坚决斗争的结果，短短十五个月中就完成了挖泥土方一千六百九十五万四千三百七十九立方公尺。
    （相等于挖筑一条由北京到天津宽三十五公尺深四公尺的运河），抛石十万零五千九百九十四立方公尺，砌坡四万四千八百六十九平方公尺，把七百公尺长的负六公尺水深的第一码头改建成为负八公尺五的深水码头。经过这样巨大的努力之后，我们终于胜利地完成了第一期艰巨而又光荣的建港任务，而且大大地缩短了工时，为国家节约一百四十余亿元的投资，并超额完成计划百分之十二，因而提前了两个多月开港。
    塘沽新港不仅紧靠华北最大的经济中心——天津，而且还背倚着祖国的首都北京，在它的后面则是资源极为丰富的华北、西北各省。过去华北地区的出入口贸易主要靠天津港口，而天津港却是一条狭窄的河港，只能容纳千吨左右的小轮，三千吨以上的大船必须停泊于海面，货物的装卸主要靠驳船进行长距离的驳运。塘沽新港的开港，不仅为华北丰饶的物产打开了广阔的出路，促进了全国特别是华北地区的经济发展；而且我们深信，由于莫斯科国际经济会议的成功，特别是这次在北京召开的亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的胜利，我国人民和其他各国人民相互之间开展和平贸易的可能性已大大增进，我国爱好和平的人民以忘我的劳动所修建起来的这一和平商港——塘沽新港，对于促进国际和平贸易的发展，无疑地也将有所贡献。
    当我们庆贺人民新港诞生的时候，让我们对毛主席和中央人民政府的英明领导，全国人民和各机关的巨大支持，苏联专家的热心帮助和指导以及直接参加建港的全体职工同志们的辛勤劳动，致衷心的感谢和热烈的祝贺！同时希望在光辉的第一期工程成就的基础上，再接再厉地继续完成修建工程，获得更多更大的成绩，迎接我们伟大祖国的建设高潮！
