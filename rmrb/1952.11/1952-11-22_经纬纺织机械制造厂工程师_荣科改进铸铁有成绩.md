    Jingwei Textile Machinery Factory Engineer
    Rong Ke Achieves Results in Improving Cast Iron
    Engineer Rong Ke of the state-owned Jingwei Textile Machinery Factory, through studying advanced Soviet experience and close cooperation with workers such as Qian Huaisheng, has achieved three important improvements in cast iron. The first improvement is simplifying the two-step process of spheroidization and graphitization in the manufacturing of ductile iron into a single-step process. This not only improved the casting performance of the molten iron and simplified the operating procedures in manufacturing, enabling general workers to master this operating technique that was previously considered difficult to master, but also saved the consumption of one of the main materials – copper – and reduced manufacturing costs. Compared with the two-step process, the single-step process reduces copper consumption by 74.4 percent and lowers costs by 45 percent. Based on the factory's planned production volume of ductile iron, this can save seven tons of copper annually and reduce costs by 4.4 billion yuan. Second, the raw materials for manufacturing ductile iron have been expanded from being limited to low-phosphorus iron to using cast iron ingredients produced by any steel plant in China. This saves the steel industry a large amount of raw material – low-phosphorus iron. Third, the method of manufacturing acicular cast iron has been changed; without adding nickel or molybdenum, ductile iron can be made into acicular cast iron with better performance equivalent to cast steel through simple heat treatment. This can save valuable rare metals such as nickel and molybdenum. (Xinhua News Agency)

    经纬纺织机械制造厂工程师
    荣科改进铸铁有成绩
    国营经纬纺织机械制造厂工程师荣科由于学习了苏联先进经验，并和工人钱怀生等密切合作，在铸铁方面获得三项重要改进。第一项改进：是把制造球墨铸铁的球化、墨化两次处理步骤简化为一次处理。这不但提高了铁水的浇铸性能，简化了制造中的操作程序，使一般工人都能掌握在过去认为是很难掌握的这一操作技术；并且节省了主要材料之一——铜的用量，降低了制造成本。一次处理和分两次处理比较，用铜量减少百分之七十四点四，降低成本百分之四十五。按照该厂球墨铸铁的计划生产量计算，每年可节省铜七吨，节约成本费四十四亿元。第二，制造球墨铸铁的原料由只能用低磷铁扩大到可以用国内任何钢铁厂出产的铸铁配料。这样，就给炼钢工业节省了大量的原料——低磷铁。第三，改变了制造针状铸铁的方法，不加镍和钼，把球墨铸铁经过简单的热处理，就可以制成性能更好、等于铸钢的针状铸铁，这样，可以节省镍、钼等贵重的稀有金属。  （新华社）
