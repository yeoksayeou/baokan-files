    Educating the Younger Generation is a Glorious Task
    Honored Teacher of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic
    Deputy of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR

    There are many important and beneficial professions. Sometimes children ask me which profession is the best? I answer without hesitation: the work you love is good. All those who have chosen their profession not by chance, but after careful consideration and according to their heart's desire, all those who work for the happiness of the motherland and regard this as their mission and purpose in life, will feel great satisfaction.
    In the Soviet state, every worker is respected. But I can say that in our country the love for teachers is particularly touching. This is also easy to understand: because teachers give every child and teenager the knowledge of life; they are their first mentors. How can such a profession not be admired?
    My father was a teacher. After him, I was also attracted to this important and noble profession. As early as when I was studying at the Girls' Middle School in Yekaterinburg City (now Sverdlovsk) in the Urals (in fact, I was a child myself at the time), I loved children and began to tutor the lagging girls in the preparatory class. This was more than fifty years ago.
    As everyone knows, the Tsarist government plunged the people into ignorance. At that time, hundreds and thousands of representatives of progressive young intellectuals, indignant at this, ran to the most remote corners of our country in order to bring the light of knowledge to the masses and dedicate themselves to serving the people. After graduating from middle school, I could have taught in Yekaterinburg, but when I felt that I could bring greater benefits to the countryside, I transferred to the Saidulihengsky Village in Perm Province to teach. This village was 130 kilometers away from the nearest railway station. The poverty of the village school was appalling, even in the generally desolate situation at the time. Many children often came to school from afar, barely clothed and barefoot. I was the only female teacher in the vast area. Although the work was very heavy—needing to teach the courses of three grades at the same time—the work should not be limited to the children. I organized an adult Sunday amateur school. However, as soon as the police and gendarmes learned that the Sunday amateur school was spreading free thought, they ordered it to be closed. They wanted to completely deprive me of my right to teach, but in the end they only transferred me to another village.
    Later, I continued to teach, received higher normal education in Petersburg, and returned to the Urals...
    The great October Socialist Revolution fundamentally changed the entire education system. In the past, usually only the children of aristocrats, merchants, and other propertied classes could study, but the new schools opened their doors to the children of the working people. All of the Soviet Union was densely covered with a network of various schools. And the seven-year universal compulsory education system was also implemented.
    The revolution raised the status of teachers to a height that could not be reached in capitalist societies, whether in the past, present, or future. Every year, tens of thousands of new teachers graduate from educational colleges and normal schools. Teachers enjoy full freedom in creative educational activities for the benefit of the people.
    The Soviet school is growing year by year, and its achievements are also improving. In order to enable the younger generation to fully acquire the precious spiritual knowledge accumulated by mankind, the school is cultivating students' feelings of collectivism and a spirit of love for creative labor.
    I have been working at Moscow Girls' Middle School No. 29 for more than twenty-five years.
    In this school named after the great Russian writer Griboyedov, we have enabled students to achieve excellent results. What are these achievements based on?
    Comrade Stalin taught that people, cadres, decide everything. The teachers in our school are united into a solid collective that loves its cause. Although many people in this collective already have rich teaching experience, everyone is constantly enriching their knowledge; while educating children, they continue to learn themselves. Some people are studying at specialized schools to improve teachers' teaching ability, others are studying the works of Ushinsky, Makarenko, Krupskaya, and other famous Russian and Soviet educators on their own, and still others are delving into various theoretical issues. For example, I am studying the theory of classroom teaching in Soviet schools. Needless to say, everyone is constantly enriching their knowledge of the subject, improving teaching methods, and paying attention to new works.
    The work of the teaching and research section in our school is carried out very well. At the meeting, teachers of various subjects exchange experiences with each other, so that each class and each student can be judged more comprehensively.
    Here, teachers of relevant subjects have jointly established specialized teaching research committees. There have been established: a teaching research committee for Russian language and literature, a teaching research committee for mathematics and physics, a teaching research committee for history and geography, and a teaching research committee for biology and chemistry. In these committees, teachers study teaching methods and the organization of school affairs, as well as the theoretical and practical problems of teaching. Teachers of the same type of course who participate in any committee often observe each other and then analyze each other's teaching methods at the committee meeting.
    The work experience of teachers of all subjects is summarized and disseminated by the teaching and research office established in the school. The teaching and research office collects various kinds of exhibits, including students' assignments. These exhibits illustrate the results that can be obtained by properly organizing the learning-education process. Any subject in the school teaching plan, as long as it is not taught rigidly and abstractly, but is closely related to daily life, will arouse students' interest. We widely adopt the object teaching method and closely coordinate extracurricular work with the teaching plan for this purpose.
    Under the initiative of the Communist Youth League organization, student study groups for literature, mathematics, biology, and geography were established in the school. These groups, which are based on the complete voluntary participation of the participants, help students to better understand the course outline in depth. For example, children draw pictures with the theme of Pushkin's works in the classroom and in the literature group, and visit museums and places related to the life and creative activities of this great Russian poet. These methods can enable children to gain more profound and solid literary knowledge.
    Students from Moscow First Medical University often voluntarily help our school. Their help is diverse: actively participating in the renovation work of our school buildings, organizing summer recreation and guiding extracurricular activities, etc.
    We often invite professors from the Medical University and teachers from our school to give reports to our senior students on international situations, the People's Republic of China, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the People's Democratic Countries, and other topics. These reports can help cultivate the children's spirit of proletarian internationalism and broaden their horizons.
    In accordance with the tasks arranged by the Communist Youth League organization, some of the most talented students often give political reports on the major events of the week in the intermediate and senior classes.
    All of our teachers and students believe that our glorious cause is to prepare the school in an exemplary manner to welcome the new school year. All classrooms, offices, gymnasiums, auditoriums, and corridors have been renovated and shine with cleanliness. Textbooks, various reference books, and various school supplies have been fully transported. The equipment in the self-study room has been supplemented, and the work of recruiting new students has been completed.
    All the teachers in our school have had good rest in the summer, and have been to various sanatoriums and rest homes.
    Our students have also had good rest in the Young Pioneers camp, travel camp, sanatorium and villa. They have improved their health and returned to school with new strength.
    Every year on January 29th, all the students and alumni of our school participate in a traditional evening party held in the school. Here you can meet doctors and engineers, geologists and designers, who always hold daughter-like love for the alma mater and teachers who nurtured them.
    What makes us happy is that many students have become teachers themselves. This year, sixty girls graduated from our school. They are all preparing to enter our country's institutions of higher learning.
    Educating the younger generation is a glorious task. The labor of those who impart life knowledge to our excellent young people has been highly evaluated by the motherland. I myself, like many other Soviet teachers, was awarded the title of Honored Teacher of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic in 1940 for many years of work in the education field. Three years ago, for my achievements in the cause of communist education of students, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR awarded me the Order of Lenin. Later, I was awarded a second Order of Lenin for many years of service.
    Many teachers in Soviet schools are elected by the people as deputies to the Soviets. The residents of the Frunze district of the capital gave me a high honor. In three consecutive elections, they elected me as a deputy to the Moscow City Soviet. In the most recent election for the highest organ of state power in the Soviet Union, I was elected as a deputy to the Supreme Soviet of the USSR.
    The Soviet people are accustomed to answering the people's trust with new patriotic undertakings. I will gladly continue to contribute my energy and knowledge to the cause of educating batches of new Soviet citizens and builders of communism. (Special article in this newspaper)

    教育青年一代是光荣的任务
    俄罗斯苏维埃联邦社会主义共和国功勋教师
    苏联最高苏维埃代表
    玛尔切雅诺娃
    有许许多多重要的和有益的职业。有时，孩子们问我，那一种职业最好？我毫不犹豫地回答说：你所喜爱的工作就是好的。凡是并非偶然地，而是经过审慎的考虑，从心所欲地选择了自己职业的人们，凡是为祖国的幸福而劳动，并把这看作是自己的使命和生活目的的人们，都会感到极大的满足。
    在苏维埃国家中，每一个劳动者都受到人们的尊重。但是，我可以说，在我国对于教师的爱戴是特别令人感动的。这也是容易理解的：因为教师把生活知识给予每一个儿童和少年；他是他们的第一个导师。这样的职业，怎么会不使人爱慕呢？
    我的父亲是一个教师。在他之后，我也为这一重要而高贵的职业所吸引。早在乌拉尔叶卡切林堡城
    （现在的斯维尔德洛夫斯克）的女子中学读书的时候（事实上，自己当时也是一个孩子），我就热爱儿童，并开始给预备班中落后的女孩子们补课。这已是五十多年以前的事了。
    大家知道沙皇政府使人民陷于愚昧状态。当时，为此愤慨的成千成百的青年进步知识分子的代表们曾跑到我国最边远的角落，以便把知识的光辉带到群众中去，献身为人民服务。在中学毕业后，我本可能在叶卡切林堡教学，但当我一感到自己可以带给农村更大的利益时，就转到彼尔姆省的萨依杜里恒斯基村去教书。这个村离最近的火车站也有一百三十公里。村里的学校的贫乏，甚至在当时一般的凄凉情况下，也显得可惊。许多孩子时常是衣不蔽体，赤着足从远地走来读书。在寥廓的地区中我是唯一的女教师。虽然工作很繁重——需要同时教三个年级的课程——但不应当使工作专限于对孩子们。我组织了成人星期业余学校。可是警察和宪兵一知道星期业余学校中宣传自由思想以后，就下令停课。他们本想完全剥夺我的教书权利，但最后只不过使我转移到另一村去。
    后来，我继续教书，又在彼得堡受了高等师范教育，并重新回到乌拉尔去……
    伟大的十月社会主义革命根本改变了全部教育制度。从前通常只是贵族、商人和其他有产阶层的子女才可以读书，新的学校则给劳动人民的子女们打开了大门。全苏联密密地布满了各样的学校网。而七年普及义务教育制也实施了。
    革命把教师的地位提到在资本主义社会中无论过去、现在和将来都不能达到的高度。每年都有成千成万的新的教师从教育学院、师范学院中毕业。教师们在为人民谋福利的创造性的教育活动方面，享有充分的自由。
    苏维埃学校年复一年地增长着，它的成绩也在提高着。为了使青年一代充分获得人类所积累的精神上的珍贵知识，学校正在培养学生具有集体主义的感情和爱好创造性的劳动的精神。
    我在莫斯科第二十九女子中学已经工作了二十五年多了。
    在这个以伟大的俄国作家格列波也多夫命名的学校中，我们曾经使学生获得优良成绩。这些成绩是依靠什么而获得的呢？
    斯大林同志教导说，人、干部决定一切。我们学校中的教师们团结成了一个牢固的、热爱自己事业的集体。虽然这个集体中间很多人已经具有丰富的教学经验，但每个人还是不断地充实自己的知识；一面教育孩子，一面自己继续学习。有一些人是在提高教师教学能力的专科学校中攻读，另一些人则自学乌申斯基、马卡伦柯、克鲁普斯卡娅及其他俄国和苏联著名教育学家的著作，再有一些人则在钻研各种理论问题。例如我所研究的就是苏维埃学校中的课堂教学理论。不消说，大家都在经常地充实自己对科目的知识，改进教学方法，并注意新的著作。
    我们学校的教务会议工作进行得很好。在会议上各科教师互相交换经验，因此可以更全面地判断每一个班和每一个学生。
    在我们这里，有关科目的教师们联合成立有专门教学研究委员会。已经成立的有：俄文和文学教学研究委员会、数学和物理教学研究委员会、史地教学研究委员会与生物和化学教学研究委员会。在这些委员会中，教师们对教学法和组织学校课务的问题、教学的理论和实际问题进行研究。参加任何委员会的同类课程的教师们，时常互相观摩，然后在委员会的会议上对彼此的教学法进行分析。
    所有各科教师的工作经验都由学校中已成立的教研室加以总结和普及。在教研室中搜集有各种各样的陈列品，其中包括着学生的作业。这些陈列品说明了善于组织学习—教育过程所能获得的结果。学校教学计划中的任何科目，只要不是呆板地、抽象地讲授它，而是使它密切地与日常生活相联系，就会引起学生的兴趣。我们之所以广泛地采用实物教学法并使校外工作和教学计划相密切配合，也就是为了这个目的。
    在共青团组织的发起下，校内学生成立了文学、数学、生物和地理研究小组。以参加者的完全自愿为工作基础的这些小组，帮助学生更好地深入了解课程提纲。例如，儿童们在课堂中，在文学小组中描绘以普希金作品为题材的图画，参观有关这位伟大俄国诗人的生活和创作活动的博物馆和地方，这些办法都能使儿童获得更深刻更牢固的文学知识。
    莫斯科第一医科大学的学生经常自愿地帮助我们学校。他们的帮助是多种多样的：热烈参加我们校舍的修缮工作，组织夏季休憩和指导校外活动等。
    我们时常邀请医科大学的教授和本校的教师为我们的高年级的学生作有关国际局势、中华人民共和国、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国、各人民民主国家及其他主题的报告。这些报告能帮助培育孩子们的无产阶级国际主义精神，并扩大他们的视野。
    依照共青团组织所布置的任务，一些最有才能的学生经常在中级班和高级班中作有关一周大事的政治报告。
    我们全体师生认为，自己的光荣事业就是模范地做好学校的准备工作来迎接新学年。各个教室、办公室、体育馆、大礼堂和走廊都修缮完毕，并闪耀着清洁的光辉。教科书、各种参考书和各种各样的学校用具都完全运到了。自修室的设备补充了，招收新生的工作也完成了。
    我们学校的全体教师在夏季中都获得了良好的休憩，都到过各疗养院和休养所。
    我们的学生们也分别在少先队营和旅行野营中、休养所和别墅中得到了良好的休憩。他们增进了自己的健康带着新生的力量回到学校。
    每年一月二十九日，所有本校的学生和校友都参加校内举行的一个传统性的晚会。在这里可以遇到医生和工程师，地质学家和设计师，她们对于曾经培育过她们的母校和教师，都始终怀抱着女儿般的爱。
    使我们感到快乐的是，许多学生自己也做了教师。今年我们学校中毕业的有六十位女孩子。她们全都准备升入我国高等学校。
    教育青年一代是一件光荣的任务。那些对我们的优秀青年授予生活知识的人们的劳动，得到了祖国的极高评价。我自己，正像其他很多的苏联教师一样，由于在教育界工作多年，于一九四○年荣膺俄罗斯苏维埃联邦社会主义共和国功勋教师的称号。三年前，由于我在对学生的共产主义教育事业中的成绩，苏联最高苏维埃主席团曾授我以列宁勋章。后来我又因多年劳绩而获得第二枚列宁勋章。
    苏维埃学校的很多教师被人民选举为苏维埃的代表。首都伏龙芝区的居民们给我以高度的荣誉，在连续三次的选举中他们都推举我做莫斯科市苏维埃的代表。在最近一次对苏维埃国家最高政权机关的选举中，我被选为苏联最高苏维埃代表。
    苏维埃人惯于以新的爱国主义的事业来回答人民的信托。我将愉快地继续把我的精力和知识贡献给教育一批批新的苏维埃国家的公民和共产主义建设者的事业。    （本报特稿）
