East China Regions Hold Intermediate Market Autumn Materials Exchange Conferences
	East China's Fujian, Anhui, Zhejiang, Southern Jiangsu and other regions have successively held intermediate market autumn materials exchange conferences. These materials exchange conferences, facing the primary market and serving the primary market, have played a significant role in meeting the needs of farmers for industrial products after the bumper harvest. The Southern Jiangsu Regional Autumn Urban-Rural Materials Exchange Conference held in Suzhou City achieved a total transaction value of 253.1 billion yuan. Most of the merchants from various medium and small towns in Southern Jiangsu participated in the transactions at this conference. Among the more than 160 representatives from Jiading County participating in the conference, over 100 were representatives from small towns. Some representatives traveled between Suzhou and Jiading three or four times, and the materials they purchased greatly exceeded their original purchase plans, some exceeding 80 percent.

	In order to implement the spirit of serving the primary market, the materials exchange conferences in various provinces and cities paid attention to organizing small transactions from the very beginning. The number of people participating in the Fujian Province Autumn Urban-Rural Materials Exchange Conference held in Fuzhou in mid-October increased nearly twofold compared to the province's summer materials exchange conference. Almost every small market town with more than fifty shops had representatives participating. Cash transactions accounted for 69.51 percent of the total transaction value, and the number of transactions increased more than twofold compared to the previous time.

Northwest Military and Administrative Committee Trade Department Rationally Adjusts Prices of Industrial Products and Livestock Products in Northwest Provinces
	Since the opening of the Tianshui-Lanzhou Railway, the prices of major industrial products in the Northwest provinces have decreased due to faster commodity and capital turnover and reduced transportation costs; the purchase prices of livestock products have also been appropriately increased. Industrial products originally transported from Xi'an to remote provinces in the Northwest by trucks and horse-drawn carts can now be directly transported to Lanzhou by train. This not only shortens the journey by more than half but also greatly reduces transportation costs. For example, the train fare for transporting a bolt of cloth is only 903 yuan, which is less than a quarter of the truck fare. This has created conditions for rationally adjusting commodity prices and narrowing the price scissors between industrial and livestock products in the Northwest provinces. Therefore, in mid-October, the Trade Department of the Northwest Military and Administrative Committee rationally adjusted the prices of 57 major commodities in Gansu, Ningxia, Qinghai, and Xinjiang provinces. For example, the price of Lanzhou cloth was reduced by 2.77 to 5.39 percent; tea was reduced by 3.5 to 6.45 percent; industrial equipment was reduced by 1.1 to 12.9 percent; the price of general merchandise in Yinchuan was reduced by 1.2 to 11.98 percent; and the price of medicines in Xining was reduced by 5.4 to 47.4 percent. At the same time, the purchase price of wool in Lanzhou, Xining, and other places was increased by 4.11 to 4.28 percent.

Lhasa Troops of the Tibet Military Region Begin Winter Land Reclamation and Canal Building
	In order to prepare for large-scale agricultural production next year, the Lhasa troops of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Tibet Military Region have already begun winter land reclamation and canal building work. They plan to plow all of this year's cultivated land before the land freezes, continue to reclaim more than 5,500 mu of wasteland, and complete a large canal that is 2,490 meters long and requires approximately 54,400 cubic meters of earth and stone.

	Although it is now late autumn, the climate on the Lhasa Plain is still warm and pleasant. The leaves of the towering poplars and willows have not yet completely fallen, and flocks of gray cranes and wild ducks fly in the clear sky. In this beautiful season, the PLA soldiers are enthusiastically reclaiming large tracts of wasteland and have widely launched a patriotic "Red Flag Emulation" campaign.

    华东各地先后举行中级市场秋季物资交流大会
    华东区福建、安徽、浙江、苏南等地先后举行中级市场秋季物资交流大会，这些物资交流大会，面对初级市场，为初级市场服务，对满足丰收后农民对工业品的需要起了很大作用。在苏州市举行的苏南区秋季城乡物资交流大会，购销总值达二千五百三十一亿元。参加这次大会进行交易的，大多数是苏南区各中、小城镇的商贩。参加大会的嘉定县代表一百六十多人中，就有一百多人是小市镇的代表，有的代表来回苏州嘉定三、四次之多，他们购进的物资大大超过他们原订的购货计划，有的超过了百分之八十。
    为贯彻为初级市场服务的精神，各省、市的物资交流大会，一开始就注意组织小额交易。十月中旬在福州举行的福建省秋季城乡物资交流大会，每天参加交易的人数比该省夏季物资交流大会增加近二倍，几乎凡有五十户商店以上的小集镇都有代表参加。现款现货交易占总交易额的百分之六十九点五一，交易笔数比前次增加一倍以上。
    西北军政委员会贸易部合理调整西北各省工业品和畜牧业产品价格天兰铁路通车后，西北各省的主要工业品，已因商品和资金周转迅速，运费减少，降低了价格；畜牧业产品收购牌价也已适当提高。原来由西安用汽车、马车运往西北边远省份的工业品，现在可由火车直运兰州。不仅行程缩短一半以上，而且运价也大大降低了。如火车运一匹布只要人民币九百零三元，还不到汽车运费的四分之一。这样，就为合理调整商品价格，缩小西北各省工业和畜牧业产品价格的剪刀差创造了条件。因此，西北军政委员会贸易部已在十月中旬，合理调整了甘、宁、青、新各省五十七种主要商品的价格。如兰州纱布价格降低百分之二点七七到百分之五点三九；茶叶降低百分之三点五到百分之六点四五；工业器材降低百分之一点一到百分之十二点九；银川百货价格降低百分之一点二到百分之十一点九八；西宁医药价格降低百分之五点四到百分之四十七点四。同时，兰州、西宁等地的羊毛收购牌价，却提高了百分之四点一一到四点二八。
    西藏军区驻拉萨部队开始冬季开荒修渠工作
    为迎接明年大规模的农业生产，中国人民解放军西藏军区驻拉萨部队已经开始冬季的开荒、修渠工作。他们计划在土地结冻以前，除将今年的耕地全部翻犁一遍外，继续开垦五千五百多亩生荒，并且完成一条长达二千四百九十公尺，约需土方和石方五万四千四百立方公尺的大水渠。
    现在虽是深秋时节，但拉萨平原上的气候仍然温暖宜人，高耸的白杨和柳树的叶子还没有完全脱落，成群的灰鹤和野鸭飞翔在晴朗的天空。解放军的战士们正在这景色秀丽的季节中，热心地开垦着大片的荒地，普遍开展了爱国主义的“红旗竞赛”运动。
