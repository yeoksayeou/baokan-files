Preparations for the third year of the Huai River project are now largely complete, and some projects have already begun. The projects currently underway include: the Bo Mountain Reservoir in Queshan County and the Nanwan Reservoir in Xinyang County in Henan Province in the upper reaches of the Huai River; the Bogang Diversion Canal in the midstream Huai River and the diversion project of the main and tributary rivers; the Sanhe闸 (sluice gate/dam) which controls Hongze Lake in the lower reaches; and the excavation work for the eight large-scale water gates to be built in the Northern Jiangsu irrigation system. In addition, the giant Fozi Ridge Reservoir in the Dabie Mountain area in the upper reaches of the Pi River, which did not stop construction during the flood season this year, is still under construction.

The third year of the Huai River project is more massive, complex, and technically demanding than the first and second years. The third year of the Huai River project is still drafted according to the principle of "storage and discharge in combination" stipulated in the decision of the Central People's Government’s State Council on governing the Huai River. This year's project requires: continuing to expand the flood storage capacity of mountain valley reservoirs, further controlling floods, reducing waterlogging, and developing irrigation, navigation and other projects to turn the Huai River's water disasters into permanent water conservancy. To this end, six large mountain valley reservoirs will be built in the third year, with a total flood storage capacity of more than 3.6 billion cubic meters; strengthen the control capacity of various completed lake storage projects; and also build more than 50 various culverts and gates, and reorganize more than 30 rivers. The earthwork required for these projects alone will total more than 180 million cubic meters.

As early as April of this year, Huai River management agencies at all levels began preparations for the third year of the project. The Subei (Northern Jiangsu) area in the lower reaches of the Huai River completed the topographic survey, soil drilling, and hydrological measurements during the flood season for the dam sites of the Sanhe闸 (sluice gate/dam), Shaobo Control闸 (sluice gate/dam), and Xiannvmiao ship lock in September this year. Henan Province in the upper reaches of the Huai River also concentrated a large number of technical cadres to form many design teams to carry out the design work for the third year's project. At present, the survey and design work for all projects in the third year has been basically completed.

In order to ensure the smooth progress of the third year of the Huai River project, from August of this year to now, the Huai River Management Committee and the Huai River Command Headquarters of Henan, Anhui, and Subei provinces have successively held meetings on engineering, finance, political work, and health work, and formulated various work plans. After the second year of the Huai River project just ended, Huai River management agencies at all levels successively concentrated on training working cadres in engineering, political work, health, and finance departments. This year's Huai River project plan particularly emphasizes small-scale farmland water conservancy projects. In order to further relieve drought and flood disasters in the Huai River Basin and turn water disasters into water conservancy, the Huai River Management Committee has established a Farmland Water Conservancy Department to specifically be responsible for farmland water conservancy work in the Huai River project. The Water Conservancy Bureaus and Huai River Command Headquarters of Henan and Subei provinces have also merged their offices respectively, and have special agencies in charge of farmland water conservancy. Farmland water conservancy agencies have also been added to the Huai River management agencies in various special districts of Anhui Province.

With the general completion of various preparatory work, more than 300 newly graduated students from universities and colleges from large cities such as Shanghai and Nanjing have successively gone to work in Huai River management agencies at all levels and various construction sites. More than 2,000 technicians recruited from Hubei, Shanghai, Southern Jiangsu and other places in the Subei area of the lower reaches of the Huai River have also arrived at the construction site. At the construction sites where work has already begun, workers and laborers have launched into intense labor. 50,000 laborers from Jiangdu, Siyang and other counties in Subei have been excavating the dam pond at the Sanhe闸 (sluice gate/dam) construction site, and have excavated 5.72 million cubic meters of earth; more than 1,000 sheds have been built on the construction site, and 40 kilometers of light rail have been laid. At the construction site of the Bo Mountain Reservoir in Henan Province in the upper reaches of the Huai River, nearly 10,000 workers, laborers, and People's Liberation Army soldiers participating in the economic construction of the motherland are vigorously excavating the diversion channel of the Bo Mountain Reservoir. The Bogang Diversion Canal project in the middle reaches of the Huai River started in mid-October, and now 30,000 laborers on the construction site are working hard with 18 water pumps.

    第三年度治淮工程准备工作大体完成
    大批技术工人和民工抵达工地部分工程已开始施工
    第三年度治淮工程的准备工作现已大体完成，部分工程已开始施工。目前已经开工的有：淮河上游河南省确山县的薄山水库、信阳县的南湾水库，淮河中游干河和支河分流工程中的泊岗引河、下游控制洪泽湖的三河闸，以及苏北灌溉系统需要兴建的八座大型水闸的挖土工程。还有今年汛期内没有停工的淠河上游大别山区的巨型佛子岭水库，现在仍在继续施工。
    第三年度治淮工程比第一年度、第二年度的工程规模都要巨大、复杂，技术性也更高。第三年度治淮工程仍是根据中央人民政府政务院关于治理淮河的决定中所规定的蓄泄兼筹的方针拟订的。这一年度的工程要求：继续扩大山谷水库的蓄洪量，进一步控制洪水，减轻内涝，兴办灌溉、航运等工程，使淮河水患变为永久的水利。为此，第三年度将修建六座大型的山谷水库，总共蓄洪量达到三十六亿公方以上；加强各已经修成的湖泊蓄洪工程的控制能力；同时还要修建各种涵闸五十多座，整理河道三十多条。以上这些工程，单是需要做的土方工程就共达一亿八千多万公方。
    早在今年四月，各级治淮机构就开始了第三年度工程的准备工作。淮河下游苏北区在今年九月就已完成了三河闸、邵伯节制闸、仙女庙船闸等闸址的地形测量、土质钻探和汛期的水文测量等工作。淮河上游河南省也曾集中了大批技术干部，组成许多设计小组，突击进行第三年度工程的设计工作。现在，第三年度全部工程的勘测、设计工作已基本完成。
    为保证第三年度治淮工程顺利进行，从今年八月到现在，治淮委员会和河南、安徽、苏北等三个省区的治淮指挥部，都曾先后分别召开了工程、财务、政治工作和卫生工作的会议，制订出各项工作计划。各级治淮机构在第二年度治淮工程刚结束后，就先后集中训练了工程、政治工作、卫生和财务等部门的工作干部。这一年度治淮工程计划中，特别重视了小型农田水利工程。为了进一步解除淮河流域的旱、涝灾害，变水患为水利，治淮委员会特设立农田水利处，专门负责治淮工程中的农田水利工作。河南、苏北两省区的水利局和治淮指挥部也分别合并办公，并设有专管农田水利的机构。安徽省各专区治淮机构中也添设了农田水利机构。
    随着各项准备工作的大体完成，从上海、南京等大城市前来参加治淮工程的三百多名刚毕业的大学和专科学校学生，已先后分赴各级治淮机构和各个工地工作。淮河下游苏北区从湖北、上海、苏南等地招聘来的两千多名技术工人，也已抵达工地。现在已开始动工的各工地，工人、民工们已展开了紧张的劳动。苏北江都、泗阳等县五万民工已在三河闸工地上开挖闸塘，开挖的土方已有五百七十二万公方；工地上并已建造了一千多间工棚，铺设好四十公里长的轻便轨道。淮河上游河南境内薄山水库的工地上，也有近万工人、民工和参加祖国经济建设的人民解放军，正在大力开挖薄山水库的输水道。淮河中游的泊岗引河工程，在十月中旬开工，现在工地上的三万民工正配合着十八部抽水机紧张工作。
