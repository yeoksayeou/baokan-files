    Tsinghua University's Intensive Russian Reading Experiment Yields Remarkable Results
    This summer, over 250 teachers and graduate students at Tsinghua University participated in an intensive Russian reading experiment. After approximately twenty days of concentrated study, they memorized between 1,000 and 1,500 words, grasped the basic knowledge of Russian grammar, and were able to independently read science and engineering books with the help of a dictionary.
    After the ideological remolding movement and the "Three-Anti" campaign, Tsinghua University teachers ideologically drew a clear line between friend and foe and criticized their past worship of the United States and Great Britain. They urgently wanted to learn advanced Soviet science, technology, and experience, but their lack of Russian was an obstacle. Therefore, the teachers were eager to learn Russian. Their purpose was also clear: they only needed to read a specific type of Russian science and engineering book, requiring a limited vocabulary and relatively simple grammatical structures. Moreover, they all had a foundation in a foreign language and long-term study habits. After studying these circumstances, the Chinese Communist Party Committee of Tsinghua University believed that these were favorable conditions for learning to read Russian. In the past three years, individual teachers and students at Tsinghua University had successfully taught themselves Russian. For example, Chen Nianyi, a student in the Department of Chemistry, through intensive study (mainly memorizing new words) for 300 hours, reached a level where he could read chemistry books and translate chemistry papers, proving that concentrated Russian study in a short period of time is highly efficient. Based on the teachers' demands and the possibility of short-term intensive study, the Chinese Communist Party Committee of Tsinghua University, in consultation with the school administration, decided to organize an intensive Russian reading experiment. In early July, Liu Zheng, a graduate student in the Department of Chemistry, conducted a pilot experiment. Liu Zheng had previously studied 19 lessons of Gu Yongzhong's Russian Reader. In the experimental study, he concentrated on self-study for 150 hours, memorized 1,500 words, and finished reading a Russian grammar book compiled by Liu Zerong. He was then able to read books in the "Organic Chemistry" category and translate relatively short chemistry papers. After gaining some experience from this experiment, the second experiment at Tsinghua University was expanded to eleven people. One of them had no prior Russian knowledge, while the others had studied anywhere from five to twelve lessons of Gu Yongzhong's Russian textbook, but most had forgotten it. They had classes for one hour each in the morning and afternoon, and collective review for two hours, for a total of 160 to 180 hours of study over 22 days (including extracurricular review). They memorized 1,400 words and learned the basic declensions of various parts of speech and the applied grammar for science and engineering books. After the experiment, the teachers acquired a preliminary reading ability, reading between half a page and two pages of specialized science and engineering books per hour. The above two experiments proved that intensive Russian study in a concentrated period of time is very effective. Tsinghua University decided to conduct a large-scale university-wide experiment, with 238 participants including professors, lecturers, and teaching assistants. The ages of the students ranged from 20 to 65. Some had studied some Russian, but had almost forgotten it; others had never studied it at all. Everyone started from scratch. The teachers participating in the experiment were divided into four groups: electrical engineering, civil engineering, mechanical engineering, and chemical engineering. This experiment stipulated a study plan and established a relatively sound teaching and research group and tutor system. After fifteen days of study for a total of 90 hours (plus review time), everyone memorized 800 to 1,000 words, learned the basic grammar in science and engineering books, and could read books such as "Hydraulics," "Structural Mechanics," "Chemical Principles," and "Metallography." Lin Shie, a professor at the Aviation Institute, memorized 1,200 words at the end of the study and added another 500 words after a month of self-study. He had already read 50 pages of "Aerodynamics." He said that his current Russian level was equivalent to his past high school English level.
    Tsinghua University's intensive Russian reading experiment was conducted under the teachers' political awareness and high degree of ideological concentration. Learning was limited to the reading of various specialized science and engineering books. Therefore, the required grammar was mainly the commonly used grammar in science and engineering books. The teachers focused on learning the applied grammar for science and engineering books, without in-depth study of declension rules, and regularized or formalized the grammatical rules. For example, nouns were only taught in three categories; the basic declensions were deduced from other changes using hard and soft vowel correspondence. In this intensive Russian reading experiment at Tsinghua University, the teaching and research group was used for collective teaching. From the compilation of teaching materials to lecturing, the teaching and research group repeatedly discussed, researched, and test-lectured before the teachers officially lectured. The Russian teachers also limited the selection of all words and vocabulary to the commonly used words in science and engineering books and analyzed prefixes and roots to help students memorize. In this way, complex grammar can be concisely and clearly taught to students. After the lecture, tutors led classroom self-study and exercises. Tutors delved into the student masses, promptly discovered problems, and provided meticulous help; at the same time, they promptly reflected the students' learning situation, their level of acceptance, and the difficulties they encountered in learning to the teaching and research group, to help teachers improve their teaching. This ensured the universal progress of the students and eliminated the phenomenon of students falling behind. In the last experiment of Russian reading at Tsinghua University, after teaching 500 words and the most basic grammar, an examination was conducted; among 215 people, 164 scored 90 or above (out of a full score of 103), and 54 scored 100 or above.

    清华大学俄文专业阅读速成试验效果良好
    清华大学教师和研究生二百五十余人在今年暑假期间进行了俄文专业阅读速成试验，他们经过二十天左右时间的突击学习，记住了一千到一千五百个单词，掌握了俄文文法基本知识，依靠字典的帮助能独立阅读理工专业书籍。
    清华大学教师们经过思想改造运动和“三反”运动，在思想上划清了敌我界限，批判了过去崇拜英美的思想，迫切地要求学习苏联先进科学技术和先进经验，但是学习苏联科学技术有一个障碍，那就是不懂俄文。因此，教师们很想学俄文。他们学俄文的目的也很明确，只要求阅读某一种俄文专业书籍，需要的单词不多，文法结构也较简单。并且大家都有一种外国语的基础和长期读书的习惯。中国共产党清华大学委员会研究了这些情况，认为这是学习俄文阅读的有利条件。清华大学三年来已有个别教师和学生自学俄文成功，如化学系学生陈念贻突击学习（主要背生字）三百小时，达到能阅读化学专业书籍，并能翻译化学论文的水平，证明在短时间内，集中学习俄文，效率很高。中国共产党清华大学委员会根据教师们的要求和短期集中学习的可能，与学校行政方面研究后，行政上决定组织俄文专业阅读速成试验。并在七月初由化学系研究生刘正进行典型试验。刘正原来学过顾用中编的俄文读本十九课，实验学习中集中自学一百五十小时，记住了一千五百个单词，读完了一本刘泽荣编的俄文文法，就已能阅读俄文“有机化学”一类的书籍，并能翻译比较短的化学论文。在这次试验取得了一些经验以后，清华大学第二次试验就增加到十一人，其中完全没有学过俄文的一人，其余学过顾用中的俄文课本五课到十二课不等，但大部分都忘了。他们每天上下午上课各一小时，集体温习两小时，经过二十二天共一百六十小时到一百八十小时的学习（包括课外复习），记住一千四百个单词，学完俄文各种词类的基本变格和理工书籍的应用文法。实验结束后，教师们获得了初步阅读能力，每小时阅读专业理工书籍半页到两页。以上两次试验证明，集中时间突击学习俄文的效果很好。清华大学决定进行全校性的大规模的试验，这次参加学习的有教授、讲师、助教等共二百三十八人。学员年龄自二十岁到六十五岁不等，有的读过一些俄文，但差不多都忘了；有的完全没有学过，大家都从头学起。参加学习试验的教师们分电机、土木、机械和化工等四个组。这次试验规定了学习计划，并建立了比较健全的教研组和辅导员制度，经过十五天共九十小时的学习时间（外加复习时间），大家都记住了八百到一千个单词，学完理工专业书籍中的基本文法，能阅读如“水力学”、“结构力学”、“化学原理”和“金相学”等书籍。航空学院教授林士谔在学习结束时记住一千二百个单词，自学一个月以后又增加五百个单词，并已看了五十页“空气动力学”。他说：他现在的俄文水平，已经相当于过去高中的英文水平了。
    清华大学这次俄文专业阅读速成试验是在教师们的政治自觉和高度思想集中的情况下进行的。学习限于理工科各种专业书籍的阅读。因此，所需要的文法主要是理工专业书籍中的常用文法。教师们着重学习理工书籍应用文法，不深入研究变格规律，并将文法规律化或公式化，例如名词只学三种类；基本变格就用硬、软母音对应法推出其他变化。清华大学这次俄文专业阅读速成试验，利用了教研组进行集体教学，从编写教材到讲课，都经过教研组反复讨论、研究、试讲，教员才正式讲课。俄文教员对全部单词和字汇的编选，也以理工书籍中的常用字为限，并将字首、字根加以分析，以帮助学员记忆。这样就可把复杂的文法精简地、清晰地传授给学员，讲课后又由辅导员领导课堂自学和作练习。辅导员深入学员群众，及时发现问题，进行细致的帮助；同时他们又把学员学习的情况、接受的程度以及学习中的困难，及时反映给教研组，帮助教员改进教学。这就保证了学员们普遍的进步，消灭了学员中掉队的现象。清华大学俄文专业阅读在最后一次试验中，教完了五百个单词和最基本的文法后，进行了一次考试；二百一十五人中考九十分以上的有一百六十四人（以一百零三分为满分），其中一百分以上的有五十四人。
