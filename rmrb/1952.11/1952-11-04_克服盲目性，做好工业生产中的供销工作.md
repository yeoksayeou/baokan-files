    Overcoming Blindness and Improving Supply and Sales Work in Industrial Production
    In the movement to increase production and practice economy, most state-owned enterprises have increased output, improved quality, and reduced costs, accumulating wealth for the country and experience for large-scale economic construction. However, some industrial leadership departments and factories, due to insufficient overall understanding of the movement to increase production and practice economy, only focus on production and neglect supply and sales work, resulting in work stoppages due to lack of materials and product backlogs. This situation exists in industries such as steel, cement, timber, coal, and machine manufacturing, although the severity varies, all have affected the development of the movement to increase production and practice economy. Examples are as follows:
    I. Raw material supply is divorced from production. Some units, when formulating production plans or assigning production tasks, did not consider the source of raw materials and did not involve cadres from the supply department, resulting in raw material supply shortages midway. For example, the output of converter steel at Tangshan Steel Plant is increasing daily, and the demand for low-phosphorus pig iron has increased by one-third compared to the original plan. However, the plant did not give sufficient consideration when preparing the production plan, resulting in the order quantity being insufficient and no certain amount of reserves in the warehouse. The plant also failed to seize the time to handle transportation for the orders already secured, so the converter had to stop work to wait for materials. Beijing Liulihe Cement Plant also frequently stopped production of mixed cement because it did not consider the insufficient supply of slag (a raw material for mixed cement). Taiyuan Machine Factory accepted a large number of orders for coal cutters but neglected the supply of ball bearings, making all completed coal cutters unable to be put into production due to the lack of ball bearings. In terms of motor manufacturing, the insufficient supply of silicon steel sheets due to insufficient coordination between departments when ordering has limited the full development of the electrical industry's productivity.
    II. Imbalance between production and sales. Some enterprises, due to neglecting sales work, have experienced some product backlog, which has also affected the development of the movement to increase production and practice economy. In 1952, the progress of capital construction lagged behind timber harvesting. Under blind harvesting and blind processing in some places, some timber specifications and varieties did not meet actual needs, resulting in some unsuitable logs and finished timber not being sold for a long time. Coupled with poor storage, the phenomenon of insect infestation and decay is also quite serious. Some enterprises, especially in the machine manufacturing industry, did not consider the needs of the country when formulating production plans and produced blindly. Therefore, many products have no sales due to unsuitable specifications. Other products such as vulcanized blue in the chemical industry and tires and麻袋(ma dai: jute sacks) in light industry also cannot be produced in large quantities due to slow sales. Some enterprises have also caused product backlog due to a purely profit-seeking perspective. For example,麻袋(ma dai: jute sacks) and car tires are slow to sell due to high prices. Steel in the Southwest and East China, and machinery in the Northeast, have also affected product sales due to high prices, low quality, and non-compliance with specifications.
    The reasons for these phenomena are all due to the failure to earnestly implement the policy of increasing production and practicing economy. This means that when formulating plans and carrying out the movement to increase production and practicing economy, it is necessary to specifically stipulate the goals of the unit according to the different situations of each factory and mine: for products where material supply and product sales have no problems, the output should be increased first, while paying attention to quality and cost; for products where material supply is difficult but sales are not a problem, raw materials should be saved or substitutes should be used, striving to increase production from saving raw materials; for products where both raw material supply and product sales are difficult, methods should be found to improve technology, improve quality, and increase varieties.
    In order to implement this policy and overcome the phenomenon of disconnection between supply, production, and sales, we must pay attention to the following issues:
    First, we must establish a comprehensive production perspective and do supply and sales work as effectively as we value production. Because without the organic cooperation of supply and sales work, production will not develop. In supply and sales work, we must first do a good job in material supply, paying special attention to the economical utilization and saving of raw materials. For example, copper is a relatively scarce material at present, but some of our units require the use of electrolytic pure copper whenever copper is used; some construction departments still use copper products to assemble doors and windows, resulting in waste. Another example is rubber, most of which we rely on imports, but we do not pay much attention to the rational use of rubber. Some tire factories cannot get good rubber, while some shoe factories use it to make transparent-soled rubber shoes. At the same time, the recycling and reuse of waste rubber has not been widely valued, resulting in the invisible waste of large quantities of waste rubber. All this does not meet the requirements of increasing production and practicing economy and should be paid attention to. Second, improve quality and reduce costs. Some enterprises only pursue output figures and rarely consider improving quality and reducing costs, which affects product sales. The leading cadres of a machine factory in Jinan do not pay attention to quality to an intolerable degree. They say: "First, it must 'look like' it, second, it must be more". Under this policy, many machines produced cannot be sold for a long time. Another example is Jingxing raw coal, a major raw material for the steel industry. In 1950, the ash content was guaranteed to be below 16.5%, in 1951 it was increased to 19%, and in 1952 it was changed to the supply of mixed coal, with an ash content as high as 24%. The increase in the ash content of raw coal has a great impact on the output of pig iron. For every 1% increase in the ash content of raw coal, the output of pig iron will be reduced by 2%; and due to impurities, the quality of pig iron and steel will be directly and indirectly affected. While improving quality, we must also pay attention to reducing costs. If in the movement to increase production and practice economy, we only pay attention to the quantity of products and not the quality and cost reduction, then the more we produce, the more we waste.
    Third, improve technology and increase varieties. For products where both raw material supply and product sales are difficult, we must improve technology and increase varieties in order to meet current needs. For example, the success of the Tangshan Steel Plant in testing the surface blowing alkaline converter steelmaking method, using alkaline pig iron to directly smelt into steel in the converter, not only solved the supply problem of low-phosphorus pig iron but also increased the output by two times and reduced the cost by 14.6%. Other examples such as the successful trial production of ductile iron and dense baked iron, the creation of 15,000 kVA transformers, 1,500 horsepower motors, and water turbines of 3,000 kW or more have all expanded the sales channels for products. This shows that only by giving play to the creativity of the working class, improving technology, and expanding varieties can we increase production and create more favorable conditions for the industrial construction of the new China.
    Fourth, we must overcome the remnants of capitalist thinking of blind operation. The idea of ​​purely pursuing profits still exists in some enterprise leading cadres. Some leading cadres of factories and mines neglect the improvement of product quality and the reduction of finished product costs, but deliberately raise product prices, attempting to obtain high profits from them to complete the task of increasing production and practicing economy. Some enterprise leading cadres do not plan to increase varieties and improve technology in coordination with actual needs, nor are they willing to accept the trial production tasks of new products that may be trialed, or change the specifications of products that do not meet the needs. This idea of ​​purely pursuing profits and conservative thinking is extremely wrong. It is fundamentally contradictory to the planned management of socialist enterprises. Overcoming these erroneous ideas can strengthen the planning of supply, production, and sales, and achieve planned production and distribution. Only in this way can we satisfactorily complete the task of increasing production and practicing economy.

### 克服盲目性，做好工业生产中的供销工作

    克服盲目性，做好工业生产中的供销工作
    在增产节约运动中，大部分国营企业都提高了产量、质量，降低了成本。为国家积累了财富，也为大规模经济建设积累了经验。但是，也有些工业领导部门和厂矿，因为对增产节约运动的全面认识不够，他们只重视生产，忽视供销工作，造成了停工待料与产品积压的现象。这种情况，在钢铁、水泥、木材、煤、机器制造等业中都存在着，虽然其严重程度不一，但都已影响到增产节约运动的开展。举例如下：
    一、原料供应和生产脱节。有些单位在订生产计划或布置生产任务时，没有考虑原材料的来源，没有吸收供应部门的干部参加，以致中途原料供应不上。如唐山钢厂转炉钢的产量日增，低磷生铁的需要量较原订计划增加了三分之一。但该厂在编制生产计划时未作充分考虑，以致订货数量不敷需要，仓库里没有一定数量的储备量，已争取到的订货，该厂又未能抓紧时间办理运输，转炉只好停工待料。北京琉璃河水泥厂，也因为没有考虑到炉渣（混合水泥的一种原料）的供应不足，以致混合水泥的生产经常停工。太原机器厂大量接受了截煤机的订货，但忽略了滚珠轴承的供应，使全部制成的截煤机因没有滚珠轴承而不能投入生产。在电机制造方面，也因订货时各部门配合不够，矽钢片供应不足，因而限制了电器工业生产力的充分发展。
    二、产销不平衡。有些企业由于对销售工作的忽视，发生了一些产品积压的现象，同样影响了增产节约运动的开展。一九五二年基本建设的进度落后于木材的采伐。在有些地方盲目地采伐与盲目地加工之下，一部木材规格品种不切合实际需要，因而部分不适用的原木与制成材长期不能脱售，加之保管不善，虫蛀腐朽的现象也相当严重。有些企业，特别是机器制造业，在订生产计划时，没有考虑国家的需要，盲目生产。因此，很多产品因规格不合，没有销路。其他如化学工业的硫化青，轻工业制品的车胎、麻袋，同样因为销路的迟滞而不能大量生产。还有些企业，由于单纯利润观点，也造成了产品积压。如麻袋、汽车轮胎因为价格过高而滞销。西南、华东的钢材，东北的机器，也因为价格高、质量低及不合规格，影响了产品的推销。
    产生以上这些现象的原因，都是因为没有认真贯彻增产节约运动的方针。这就是在制订计划和开展增产节约运动时，必须根据各厂矿的不同情况，具体规定本单位的奋斗目标：凡材料供应、产品销路都没有问题的产品，应首先增加产量，同时注意质量和成本；材料供应有困难而销路没有问题的产品，应节约原材料或选用代用品，从节约原材料中争取增产；凡原材料供应、产品销路都有困难的产品，应设法改进技术，提高质量，增加品种。
    为了贯彻这个方针，克服供、产、销脱节现象，我们要注意以下几个问题：
    第一、必须树立全面的生产观点，要像重视生产一样切实做好供销工作。因为没有供销工作的有机配合，生产也不会发展的。在供销工作中，首先要做好材料供应工作，特别要注意经济地利用原材料和节约原材料。例如铜，是当前比较缺乏的物资，但我们有些单位只要用到铜的时候，一律要求使用电解纯铜；有些建设部门，依然用铜制品装配门窗，形成浪费。又如橡胶，我国大部依靠进口，而我们对橡胶的合理使用是很不重视的。有些轮胎工厂得不到好的橡胶，而一些制鞋工厂却用以制造透明底的胶鞋。同时对废胶的回收再制，也未普遍引起重视，致使大批废胶在无形中浪费掉了。这都不符合增产节约的要求，应引起我们注意。第二、提高质量，降低成本。有些企业，只单纯的追求产量数字，对提高质量与降低成本则很少考虑，以致影响产品的销路。济南的一个机器厂的领导干部不重视质量已经到了令人不能容忍的程度。他们说：“第一要‘像’、第二要多”。在这个方针下，生产出来的许多机器，长期卖不出去。又如井陉原煤，为钢铁工业的主要原材料，一九五○年保证灰份在百分之十六点五以下，一九五一年则提高到百分之十九，一九五二年改为供应混煤，灰份竟高达百分之二十四。原煤灰份的增加，对生铁的产量有很大影响，原煤灰份每增加百分之一，便会减低生铁产量百分之二；且因杂质关系，直接间接均会影响到生铁与钢材的质量。在提高质量的同时，还须注意到成本的降低。如果在增产节约运动中，只注意产品数量，不注意质量和降低成本，那就是生产越多，浪费越大。
    第三、改进技术，增加品种。对原材料供应与产品销路均有困难的产品，必须改进技术，增加品种，才能适合目前需要。如唐山钢厂试验表面吹风碱性转炉炼钢法的成功，使用碱性生铁直接在转炉内冶炼成钢，不但解决了低磷生铁的供应问题，且使产量提高了二倍，成本降低了百分之十四点六。又如球墨铸铁与密烘铸铁的试制成功、一万五千千伏安变压器、一千五百马力电动机、三千瓩以上水力发电机等产品的创制，均给产品扩大了销售的道路。这都说明了只有发挥工人阶级的创造性，改进技术，扩大品种，才能增加生产为新中国工业建设创造更多的优越条件。
    第四、必须克服盲目经营的资本主义的思想残余。单纯追求利润的思想，还在一部分企业领导干部中存在着。有些厂矿的领导干部，忽视产品质量的提高和成品的降低，却故意把产品价格提高，企图从中取得高额利润，以完成增产节约的任务。有些企业领导干部，没有有计划地配合实际需要增加品种，改进技术，也不愿接受可能进行试制的新产品的试制任务，和改变不符合需要的产品的规格，这种单纯追求利润的思想和保守思想，是极端错误的。它和社会主义性质的企业的计划管理是根本矛盾的。克服这些错误思想，才能加强供、产、销的计划性，做到有计划地生产和分配。这样，才能完满地完成增产节约的任务。
