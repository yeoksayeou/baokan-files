    [By Our Correspondent] The entire delegation of Soviet cultural workers and the Soviet art work team had arrived in Shanghai by November 28. The Soviet film art worker delegation, headed by Fedorov, also arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing at noon on the 27th. The East China Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, the Shanghai Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, the Shanghai Municipal People's Government, and representatives from Shanghai's literary and art circles, workers, students, women, and other sectors have warmly welcomed and hosted the Soviet friends in recent days. The members of the Soviet cultural worker delegation and the Soviet art work team who arrived in Shanghai have been visiting, holding talks, and attending symposiums and report meetings in recent days, and have been warmly welcomed by the masses everywhere.
    On the 26th, G.M. Tikhonov, head of the Soviet cultural worker delegation, and Yefimov visited the Shanghai Revolutionary History Memorial Hall and the Shanghai Museum, respectively. Grusenko met with Zhu Xian, a scientist from the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and discussed scientific issues. On the morning of the 27th, Tikhonov and Yefimov visited the state-owned Shanghai No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory, where the martyr Gu Zhenghong of the "May 30th Movement" worked before his death. They had detailed talks with Dai Kedu and Zhou Gaosheng, veteran workers who participated in the "May 30th" movement and are now advanced production workers. At the same time, Grusenko visited the Biology Department of Fudan University and held a symposium with professors from the department. He elaborated on the basic viewpoints that should be possessed in studying biology. In the afternoon, Tikhonov, Grusenko, and Yefimov participated in symposiums of Shanghai literary and art circles, biologists, and historians, respectively. At the symposium of literary and art circles, Tikhonov made incisive elaborations and detailed introductions on how writers should create typical characters, oppose formalism and conceptualization, depict the struggle between progress and backwardness, and the methods and experience of the Soviet Union in training new writers.
    On the afternoon of the 27th, Chulaki, the leader of the Soviet art work team, participated in a report meeting held by the preparatory committee of the East China and Shanghai Federation of Literary and Art Circles and gave a special report on "The Past Heritage and Modern Soviet Art." He said: Folk art is the foundation of all kinds of art. The art created by the people themselves not only expresses their understanding of the surrounding reality and the world, but also prominently expresses the character, characteristics, and love of the people for their motherland; at the same time, it also powerfully expresses the life and ideals of the people. These works, after continuous refinement, finally reach a perfect state and become an excellent artistic tradition of a nation. Chulaki cited the achievements in Russian music and fine arts to illustrate the significant influence and role of artistic heritage in the development of Soviet art. On the morning of the 27th, members of the Soviet art work team visited Sun Yat-sen's former residence and the Lu Xun Memorial Hall; in the evening, they continued to perform for cadres of the Chinese People's Liberation Army stationed in Shanghai. After the performance, Xin Guozhi, deputy director of the political department of the Songhu Garrison District of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, presented a banner to the Soviet art work team on behalf of the troops stationed in Shanghai.
    Fedorov, head of the Soviet film art worker delegation, said at the grand welcome ceremony at the station: "We are very excited to come to this glorious city with revolutionary traditions." He praised the films "Cuigang Red Flag" and "Shangrao Concentration Camp" produced by the Shanghai Film Studio for their high degree of ideological content and artistic skill; and congratulated the Shanghai film workers on their greater achievements.
    Also reported: The Soviet Army Red Flag Song and Dance Ensemble widely participates in the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month" activities in Nanjing. Some members of the song and dance ensemble held a symposium with literary and art workers from Nanjing and the garrison troops on the 26th. At the meeting, members of the song and dance ensemble introduced in detail how the members of the Soviet Army Red Flag Song and Dance Ensemble regularly went deep into the troops to experience the soldiers' lives, thoughts, and feelings, and sing for the soldiers, as well as the song and dance ensemble's political study, cultural study, and professional training experiences. Since the 24th, the song and dance ensemble has performed three times in a row, with an audience of more than 20,000 people. On the evening of the 27th, a radio evening party was held, and more than two million people in Nanjing and Jiangsu Province listened.
    The 27th was the 17th anniversary of the naming of the Soviet Army Red Flag Song and Dance Ensemble and its awarding of the Order of the Red Star. The East China Military Region and all circles in Nanjing held a grand celebration ceremony. Tang Liang, director of the Political Department of the East China Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and Ke Qingshi, Mayor of the Nanjing Municipal People's Government, attended the meeting to congratulate.
