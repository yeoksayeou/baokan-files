The Motherland's Delegation of Comfort Arrives at Ma Liang Mountain
Volunteer Army Unit, Hu Rujun

    On the night of October 14th, the Motherland's Delegation of Comfort arrived at the front lines of Ma Liang Mountain.

    Female comrades from the propaganda team, holding fresh flowers picked from the mountains and fields, and the band, beating drums and gongs, rushed from the front lines. Comrades who ran from the studio and the fighting troops carrying automatic rifles merged together, singing songs and shouting slogans, lifting the representatives high. Strong arms reached out to them, everyone wanting to shake hands with the representatives, say a word, and ask about the well-being of the motherland. Although it was late autumn, with mountain winds carrying fine rain, people were sweating and felt indescribable joy and happiness in their hearts.

    The next day, the hero representatives of a certain Volunteer Army unit guarding Ma Liang Mountain, the staff of the directly subordinate units, and the delegation of comfort jointly held a welcome and comfort meeting. Wearing new clothes and anti-American aggression commemorative medals, the troops presented flowers and speeches to the representatives of the people of the motherland as a sign of respect. The unit commander used several numerical figures as a gift to welcome the delegation of comfort. He said that in the three months of defense on Ma Liang Mountain, they had annihilated more than 6,200 enemy soldiers and shot down or damaged 85 enemy planes and 72 tanks. He said that we will certainly answer the concern of Chairman Mao and the people of the motherland with even greater victories in the future. The delegation of comfort presented the unit with a large silk banner representing the sentiments of the people of the motherland. Written on the banner were the words: "You are the outstanding sons and daughters of the people of the motherland, defenders of Asian peace and world peace." Reading these two sentences, everyone felt indescribable pride and joy.

    At the meeting, seven hero representatives accepted flowers from the delegation of comfort. Among them were Gao Ruizeng, a hero who shot down or damaged seven enemy planes in seven days, Yang Chunxian, the army's famous sniper, skilled gunners, heroic assault troops who charged into battle, and model workers. Some of them were veteran soldiers who had experienced hundreds of battles in the Liberation War, and some were workers and peasants who were still on the production front two years ago, and today they have become heroes on the Korean battlefield.

    Amidst applause, the representatives of the delegation of comfort delivered speeches to the conference. Worker representative Li Shuangzhen spoke the bold words of the people of the motherland: "The working class of the motherland has stood up, we have the strength to support you; whatever you need, we will support you; wherever you fight, we will support you!" Farmer representative Kong Qingshou introduced the situation of the production increase and conservation campaign carried out in their village to support the Volunteer Army. He talked about overcoming the drought and achieving a bumper harvest, as well as the growth of mutual aid teams and the widespread use of new-style farm tools. Finally, he talked about the new life in the countryside becoming richer and healthier day by day. Speaking of this, he laughed heartily, his black and red face revealing pride and happiness. This reminded us of the images of countless liberated peasants in the motherland. As we listened to their words, we seemed to return to the motherland, seeing the fertile farmland, the factories with towering chimneys, the young people singing and dancing, and the laughing old people, as well as the beautiful prospects of socialism.

    In the evening, the evening party began. The Zhongnan Military Region Art Troupe performed the drum song "Seizing the Luding Bridge," bringing us back to the memories of the Long March. The scenes of the Red Army heroes climbing snow-capped mountains and crossing grasslands were as if before our eyes. Countless martyrs paved the way for the construction of the motherland, and we will never allow the American aggressors to destroy the peaceful construction of the motherland.

    When the delegation of comfort arrived at the front lines of Ma Liang Mountain, the fighting here was in full swing. While warmly welcoming and entertaining the delegation of comfort, the commanders and fighters were carefully planning: "We must use the victory of the battle as a gift to welcome the delegation of comfort!"

    In front of the position, there were two hilltops with elevations of 179 and 159, guarded by two platoons of the Li puppet army. After arranging the attack preparations, the warriors of a certain company captured the hilltops in one go one night. But the enemy had already built tunnels on the mountain, and the remaining enemies shrank into the tunnels. Our army guarded the tunnel entrances, pressuring the enemy to come out and surrender.

    Soldier Gong Yufu of the eighth squad squatted at a cave entrance to monitor the enemy. As he was thinking of ways to solve the enemy in the cave, suddenly, a puppet soldier窜 out from another cave entrance, dark and menacing, charging straight towards him. The two faced each other. Gong Yufu immediately knocked the enemy's automatic rifle out of his hand, and then began a fierce fight. Gong Yufu pressed the enemy to the ground, but the guy was big and struggling to turn over. After a tense battle and struggle, Gong Yufu was very tired. In the midst of the crisis, a solemn feeling surged in his heart: could he let the enemy turn over? No! He decided to say goodbye to the motherland forever and die together with the enemy. He pulled out his hand grenade and lit it.

    On the dark hilltop, the position was quiet, and Gong Yufu regained consciousness. He touched the blood stains on his body, and the enemy's corpse lay beside him. It turned out that the guy was about to turn over when the grenade exploded, and the enemy's body blocked Gong Yufu. The brave man won.

    When his comrades rushed over, Gong Yufu was checking the weapons left behind by the enemy, and the battle was over.

    On another position, the frontline battle also started. It was a moonless night, and flares illuminated the entire mountain, and red tracers swept across the night sky. Then, the gunfire subsided, and the light went out. At this time, the representatives of the motherland were on this position, witnessing with their own eyes the heroic posture and great victory of the most outstanding sons and daughters of the motherland. Batches of prisoners were brought down, and piles of spoils were carried off the position. The political instructor of the attacking unit reported to the representatives of the delegation of comfort as follows:

    "Last night, we were unable to personally welcome the representatives, we greeted the arrival of the delegation of comfort with the victory of the battle. This time, we completely annihilated an enemy company, and many heroic figures emerged in the battle. Platoon leader Liu Yunhe was wounded as soon as he attacked the first hilltop, and he continued to command the troops until the end. When attacking the last hilltop, he and four other soldiers rushed onto the position guarded by more than a platoon of enemies and wiped them out." He said: "The great motherland supports and inspires us, making us brave and invincible. I feel happy and proud to be able to represent the troops in reporting the victory to the representatives of the people of the motherland."

    祖国人民的慰问团到了马良山
    志愿军某部  胡汝骏
    十月十四日夜里，祖国人民慰问团到达了马良山前线。
    宣传队的女同志捧着从山野里采来的鲜花，乐队敲锣打鼓从前沿赶来，从工作室里跑来的同志和背着自动枪的战斗队伍汇合在一起，唱着歌儿，喊着口号，把代表们高高地抬起来了。一个个健壮的手臂伸向他们，谁都想和代表握握手，说句话，问一问祖国的好。虽然是深秋，山风夹着细雨，但是人们头上冒着汗，心里感到有说不出的愉快和幸福。
    第二天，守卫在马良山的志愿军某部的功臣代表、直属队的机关干部和慰问团联合举行了欢迎、慰问大会。穿着新衣，戴着抗美援朝纪念章的队伍，向祖国人民的代表献花、献词致敬。部队长用几个数目字当做欢迎慰问团的献礼。他说，在马良山三个月的守备中，歼敌六千二百余名，击毁击伤敌机八十五架、坦克七十二辆。他说，我们今后一定以更大的胜利来回答毛主席和祖国人民的关怀。慰问团把代表祖国人民的心意的一大幅锦旗献给部队。旗上写着：“你们是祖国人民的优秀儿女，亚洲和平与世界和平的捍卫者”。念着这两句话，每个人都有说不出的骄傲和喜悦。
    会上，七位功臣代表接受了慰问团的献花。这里有七天打落打伤敌机七架的功臣高瑞增，有全军著名的狙击手杨纯贤，有熟练的炮手，有冲锋陷阵的突击英雄，有模范工作者。他们有的是曾经在解放战争中身经百战的老战士，有的两年前还是在生产战线上的工人和农民，今天都已成为朝鲜战场上的英雄了。
    慰问团的代表在掌声中向大会献词。工人代表李双禛说出了祖国人民的豪语：“祖国工人阶级已经站立起来了，我们有力量支援你们；你们需要什么，我们支援什么；你们打到那里，我们支援到那里！”农民代表孔庆寿介绍了他们村里开展增产节约运动、支援志愿军的情况。他谈到了战胜旱灾，取得丰收，也谈到了互助组的成长和新式农具的普遍使用。末了，他谈到了农村里一天一天走向富裕、健康的新生活。说到这里，他嘿嘿地笑起来，黑红的脸上透出骄傲和幸福的神情。这使我们想起了祖国无数翻身农民的形象。随着他们的话，我们仿佛回到了祖国，看到了肥沃的农田土地，烟囱高耸的工厂，唱歌跳舞的青年和欢笑的老人，还有，社会主义的美丽远景。
    傍晚，晚会开始了。中南军区文工团演出了大鼓
    “抢救泸定桥”，把我们带到了长征生活的回忆里。红军英雄们爬雪山、过草地的情景如在眼前。无数先烈为建设祖国铺平了道路，我们绝不允许美国侵略者破坏祖国的和平建设。
    当慰问团到达马良山前线时，这儿的战斗正激烈地进行着。指战员们在热烈欢迎、招待慰问团的同时，都在那儿精心计划着：“要以战斗的胜利作为迎接慰问团的献礼！”
    阵地前面，有标高一七九和一五九的两个山头，两个排的李伪军守在那儿。某连的勇士们在安置好攻击准备之后，便在一天夜里一气就攻占了山头。但敌人早在山上构筑了坑道，残余的敌人龟缩到坑道里去了。我军守住了坑道口，压迫敌人出来投降。
    八班战士宫玉福蹲在一个洞口监视敌人。当他正在想办法解决洞里的敌人时，蓦地，从另外一个洞口窜出一个伪军，黑呼呼地，直向他冲来。两个人面对面了。宫玉福一下子摔掉了敌人手里的自动步枪，接着摔开了交。宫玉福把敌人压在地下，可是那家伙个子大，一蹶一蹶地想翻过来。经过紧张的战斗和搏斗后，宫玉福很疲累了。在危急中间，他涌起了一种庄严的心情：难道能让敌人翻过来吗？不能！他决定与祖国永别，和敌人同归于尽。他摸出自己的手榴弹，拉响了。
    黑洞洞的山头上，阵地静静的，宫玉福清醒过来了。他摸了摸身上沾有血渍，身旁躺着敌人的尸体。原来那家伙正要翻身起来，手榴弹爆炸了，敌人的肉体挡住宫玉福。勇敢的人胜利了。
    当战友们赶来时，宫玉福正在检查敌人留下的枪支，战斗已经结束了。
    在另一个阵地上，前沿的战斗也打响了。这是一个月黑天，照明弹照得满山通亮，红色弹道掠过夜空。而后，枪声沉寂了，光亮熄灭了。这时祖国的代表们在这个阵地上，亲眼看着祖国最优秀的儿女们的英雄姿态和获得的伟大胜利，成批的俘虏带下来，成堆的战利品背下阵地。攻击部队的指导员向慰问团代表作了如下的汇报：
    “昨晚，我们没能亲自欢迎代表，我们以战斗的胜利迎接慰问团的到来。这一次，全歼敌人一个连，战斗中出现了很多英雄人物。一排副刘允和从攻上第一个山头就负伤，一直指挥部队打到最后。当攻到最后一个山头时，他和其他四个战士冲上有一个多排的敌人驻守的阵地，消灭了敌人。”他说：“伟大的祖国支持着、鼓舞着我们，使我们英勇无敌。我以能代表部队向祖国人民的代表汇报胜利的战绩感到幸福和骄傲。”
