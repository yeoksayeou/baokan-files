Xinhua News Agency: The American news agencies continue to reveal the heavy losses suffered by the American invading forces under the heavy blows of the Korean and Chinese People's Armies. A dispatch from the American Associated Press reporter on the central Korean front on the 2nd admitted that: "The number of people sacrificed and the amount of ammunition consumed by the 'allied forces' in the recent three weeks of battle has shocked the 'allied' commanders, and will shock the public when the full extent of the losses is finally announced. These three weeks of fighting were the second most costly battle in the 28-month Korean War in terms of losses of elite troops, second only to the disastrous defeat of the Eighth Army in North Korea in 1950." The dispatch also stated that one of the reasons for the American invading forces' disastrous defeat was "the amazing effectiveness of Chinese artillery."

Due to the dramatic increase in American casualties, the American military authorities are even more hastily transferring American troops away from the front lines and driving the Syngman Rhee army to act as cannon fodder. A dispatch from International News Service, Tokyo, on the 3rd admitted that "American troops are being withdrawn from the Triangle Hill front due to casualty rates reaching a one-year high, and Republic of Korea troops (i.e., the Syngman Rhee puppet army) are being brought in to replace them." According to American news agencies, under the command of the American authorities, the Syngman Rhee puppet army has been launching risky attacks on the central front for days, attempting to seize several high grounds that had been captured by the Korean and Chinese People's Armies, but they have all retreated in disarray after suffering heavy blows. A dispatch from United Press, Seoul, stated that the Syngman Rhee puppet army launched three attacks on the 2nd, "but each time they were repelled by the fierce artillery, mortar, and machine-gun fire of the communists." The heavy bombardment of the Korean and Chinese People's Armies "broke the morale of the South Korean army. They ran, crawled, or rolled back down." "Shell after shell fell on the South Korean attackers, and they desperately tried to find any place to hide." In the end, the Syngman Rhee puppet army had to "retreat down the mountain." On the 3rd, according to Associated Press reporter Randolph, "The South Korean army made a final assault to retake the top of Triangle Hill... By evening, the attacks on Triangle Hill and Jane Russell Hill were repelled by the fierce fire of the Chinese army's light mortars, the enemy's fire was very accurate and fierce... The failure to retake these two hills was a great disappointment to the Allied forces."

The repeated defeats and heavy losses of the Syngman Rhee puppet army have made the American invaders, who are trying to "use Asians to fight Asians," extremely uneasy. Although Van Fleet, commander of the American Eighth Army in Korea, is still boasting that the Rhee puppet army is "fighting brilliantly," the American invaders' uneasiness is undeniable. An Associated Press dispatch from the central Korean front on the 2nd pointed out uneasily that "South Korean losses must be considered a serious matter, because the new Republic of Korea army is a force vigorously trained modeled after the American army." The American invaders originally hoped to rely on this force as a gamble to replace the American army in dying, but this gamble is so unreliable that even International News Service has to say: "It is now beginning to be seen that the Republic of Korea army does not seem able to hold the line." In this way, in the American invaders' war of aggression against Korea, which they want to continue and expand, the armies of the United States and its "allies" will only continue to be consumed endlessly on the front lines and suffer increasingly heavy losses.

Xinhua News Agency, 8th: The American invading forces and the Rhee puppet army have suffered extremely heavy blows in the three-week battle for the hills near Shangganling, north of Kimhwa on the central Korean front. An Associated Press dispatch from Seoul on the 5th, citing a comprehensive report on the battle situation by its reporter Randolph, once again admitted that the American invading forces' "casualties and the large amount of materials used are unprecedented, except for the disastrous defeat of the Allied forces in North Korea in 1950. The consumption of materials even exceeds the figures for 1950. The battle of Kimhwa has now become a bottomless pit, devouring more Allied military resources than any general offensive by the Chinese army."

This battle for the hills north of Kimhwa began on October 14th. The American invading forces dispatched a large number of infantry, as well as aircraft, tanks, and artillery, but they were all beaten to a pulp by the heroic Korean and Chinese People's Armies. The powerful artillery fire of the Korean and Chinese People's Armies inflicted serious blows on the enemy. An Associated Press report from the central Korean front stated: "On the Kimhwa battlefield, the fierce and concentrated artillery fire of the Chinese army has begun to dominate the entire battle. Under this superior situation of the Chinese army, the Allied infantry has been unable to hold Sniper Ridge. Its rocky and sandy slopes have been blasted into dust by artillery shells, making it impossible for the troops to hide." "The particularly fierce artillery fire of the Chinese army and its seemingly endless ammunition have repeatedly paralyzed the Allied infantry operations." A dispatch from International News Service on the 3rd admitted: "The American Seventh Division infantry has fought hard and paid a great price in lives." The American military authorities finally concentrated "a large part of the Eighth Army's artillery fire" and drove the Syngman Rhee puppet army to launch risky counterattacks. However, they still suffered heavy blows and made no progress. Those enemies who climbed up the hills were all annihilated by the counterattacking forces of the Korean and Chinese People's Armies. A United Press report revealed: "Of the three Republic of Korea army units, two were 'completely annihilated,' and the third had only eighteen people left." The reporter from this news agency, Kendry, reported on the situation of the Rhee puppet army being attacked by our army's soldiers at that time, saying: "The South Korean army rushed towards the top of the mountain, but a Chinese soldier stood up, waved his arms, and threw grenades at the South Korean army. He almost single-handedly broke this attack!" In the face of the heroic soldiers and strong fortifications of the Korean and Chinese People's Armies, an Associated Press dispatch on the 2nd admitted that their artillery fire was not very effective, "This cannot allow the Allied forces to take Triangle Hill, or even rescue the neighboring Jane Russell Hill." An Associated Press dispatch from Seoul on the 4th stated that the Korean and Chinese People's Armies "have built an iron defense line."

Under this situation, Van Fleet, commander of the American Eighth Army in Korea, rushed to the Kimhwa area on the 5th to "inspect." However, on the same day, a United Press dispatch from Seoul admitted: "Exhausted South Korean infantry was driven out of Triangle Hill by the communists' dense artillery and mortar fire on the 5th..." The Syngman Rhee puppet army, driven by the American invading forces to launch a risky counterattack, once again suffered heavy casualties and retreated in disarray.

While large numbers of the Syngman Rhee puppet army served as cannon fodder for the American invading forces, the casualties of the American troops were also increasing significantly. From the news dispatches sent by the American news agencies, it can be seen that the blows suffered by the American army were no less than those suffered by the Rhee puppet army, which was used as a sacrifice by the American invading forces.

International News Service reporter Shackney reported on the situation of an American company being badly mauled in a dispatch on the 4th. He wrote: "The battle has stopped, and they are counting the casualties." "Many people are missing from this company, and Warrant Officer Kloggett called the team together to see who was still alive and who was dead... Now the infantrymen—those who are still alive—are lined up, the team is pitifully small, the soldiers are all bearded, dirty, and exhausted; then the roll call began. During the roll call, many people will never answer again. Captain Yost said: 'There's nothing to say. They hit us. Most of them are lying in the trenches, and I have to call them up to fight. A large number of shells are coming at any time. It seems like it will never stop.' Private Holan said: 'There are many recruits among us... Many of them were killed because they didn't know to duck.'" The remarks of the American officers and soldiers quoted in this dispatch clearly illustrate the low morale of the American army and the embarrassing situation of using recruits as cannon fodder due to heavy losses and insufficient manpower.

Associated Press reporter Barnard revealed the situation of an American reconnaissance team being severely attacked on the 3rd. He wrote: "Two lieutenants who were classmates at West Point died last week on two consecutive nights." Cooper led an outpost of twenty people "to reconnoiter a hill occupied by the enemy." "The Chinese army ambushed them, attacking them from three directions," and this American army fled in disarray. Cooper "stepped on a landmine and was killed," and "of the other twenty people, six were killed and fourteen were wounded," that is, all were annihilated. "Johnson led an outpost on the second night to reconnoiter the same hill, his outpost was also ambushed by the Chinese army, and a total of four people, including Johnson, were killed, and another nine were wounded."

In the American wounded soldier hospitals, the wounded American soldiers talked about their disastrous defeats with lingering fear, reflecting the war-weariness of this army that did not know why it was fighting. International News Service reporter Hamov quoted some of these wounded soldiers' remarks: Lieutenant Richie, lying in bed, described the battle in which he led his troops "to rescue a company that had only a few people left," but was also beaten to a pulp. He said: "The radio operator next to me and the sergeant in the platoon were killed. There was simply no place to hide. The mortar shells fired by the Chinese soldiers came at a rate of one per second, it was terrible."

Another wounded soldier, Sergeant Snyder, said: "When we attacked Triangle Hill, the communist army's artillery fire was very accurate. Shells kept falling, and soldiers fell to the ground in response. A mortar shell penetrated the top of my bunker and hit me in the back. Five of us were hit, and a sergeant was killed." He also said: "I was originally scheduled to be rotated and set off to return home at the beginning of this month, but they left us here to carry out this operation. What for?" He said: "I am very glad that I will not go back there again."

The battle in the Shangganling area north of Kimhwa is still going on, and our army has annihilated more than 15,300 enemies by November 2nd. Regarding the fate of the American invading forces and the Rhee puppet army in future battles, even the American news agencies are very pessimistic. An Associated Press dispatch on the 2nd said: "Coming again is just an expense, and there will be no gain."

    朝鲜前线金化地区敌军损失惨重狼狈已极
    【新华社讯】美国通讯社继续透露出美国侵略军在朝中人民军队沉重打击下损失惨重的情形。美联社记者二日自朝鲜中线发出的消息承认：在最近三星期的战斗中，“联军所牺牲的人和所消耗的军火，已使联军的司令官们震惊了，而且若在最后公布全部损失时，还将使公众震惊。这三星期的战斗是二十八个月的朝鲜战争中第二次损失精锐部队最多的战斗，这次损失仅次于一九五零年第八军在北朝鲜惨败时的损失。”消息中并且说：美国侵略军遭受惨败的原因之一，“是因为中国的大炮发挥了惊人的作用”。
    由于美军伤亡剧增，美国军事当局正更加急急忙忙地把美军调离前线，而驱使李承晚军队来替死。美国国际新闻社东京三日电承认：“美军由于伤亡率达到一年来的最高点而撤离三角山前线，大韩民国军（即李承晚伪军）被调进来替换他们。”据美方通讯社透露，李承晚伪军在美军当局驱使下，连日在中部前线冒险发动进攻，企图夺取被朝中人民军队克服的几个高地，但都在遭到沉重的打击后狼狈溃退。合众社自汉城发出的消息说：李承晚伪军在二日曾发动三次进攻，“但是每次都被共军的猛烈的大炮、迫击炮和机枪火力所击退”。朝中人民军队的大炮的猛轰，“把南朝鲜军的士气打垮了。他们跑着、爬着或者滚着又退了下来”。“炮弹一枚接一枚落在南朝鲜攻击者身上，他们拚命设法寻找可能找到的任何躲避的地方”。最后，李承晚伪军不得不“退下山坡”。三日，据美联社记者伦多夫报道：“南朝鲜军作最后的冲击，以便夺回三角山顶……到傍晚时分，对三角山和珍妮露赛山的进攻都被中国军队轻型迫击炮的猛烈炮火所击退，敌军的炮火甚为准确并且来势凶猛……没有夺回这两个山头，使联军感到很失望”。
    李承晚伪军屡战屡败，损失惨重的情况，使竭力想“用亚洲人打亚洲人”的美国侵略者极为不安。尽管侵朝美国第八军军长范佛里特还在吹嘘说什么李伪军“打得很出色”，然而，美国侵略者的不安是无可掩盖的。美联社朝鲜中线二日电不安地指出：“南朝鲜的损失必须要认为是严重的事情，因为新大韩民国的军队是以美军为榜样而大力训练出来的部队。”美国侵略者原来期望能依靠这支赌本来代替美国军队送死，但是这支赌本却是如此靠不住，甚至连美国国际新闻社也不得不说：“现在已开始看出，大韩民国军似乎不能守住战线”。这样，在美国侵略者要想继续和扩大进行的侵朝战争中，美国和它的“盟国”的军队将只能继续在战线上无限止地消耗下去，并受到日益惨重的损失。
    【新华社八日讯】在朝鲜中线金化以北上甘岭附近山岭的为时三周的争夺战中，美国侵略军和李伪军已经蒙受十分惨重的打击。美联社汉城五日电引述该社记者伦多夫的战况综合报道，再一次承认：美国侵略军“在人员的伤亡和使用的大量物资上，除了一九五零年盟军在北朝鲜的惨败情形以外，是空前未有的。在物资消耗上还要超过一九五零年的数字。金化的战役现在已经成了一个无底洞，它所吞食的盟军军事资源要比任何一次中国军队的总攻势所吞食的都更多”。
    这次在金化以北进行的山岭争夺战是在十月十四日开始的。美国侵略军曾出动了大量步兵和飞机、坦克、大炮，都被英勇的朝中人民军队打得落花流水。朝中人民军队的强大炮火给了敌军以严重的打击。美联社自朝鲜中线报道说：“在金化地区战场上，中国军队大炮炮火的猛烈集中，已开始在整个战斗中占优势。在中国军队这种优越的形势下，联军步兵已无法守住狙击兵岭。它的岩石和沙土的山坡被炮弹炸成灰土，使军队无从隐蔽。”“中国军队特别猛烈的炮火及看来无限的弹药一再使联军的步兵作战陷于瘫痪”。美国国际新闻社三日电承认：“美国第七师步兵曾经苦战并付出了很大的生命代价”。美军当局最后集中了“第八军的一大部分炮火”，并驱使李承晚伪军冒险进行反扑。但是，仍然遭到惨重打击，毫无进展。那些爬上山岭的敌人，都被朝中人民军队反击部队歼灭。合众社的报道透露：“有三支大韩民国军部队，两支‘全军覆没’，第三支只剩下十八个人。”这个通讯社的记者肯德立报道李伪军当时受到我军战士打击的情形说：“南朝鲜军冲向山顶，但是一个中国士兵站起来挥舞着手臂向南朝鲜军投掷手榴弹。他几乎独个儿击破了这次进攻！”在朝中人民军队的英勇战士和强固防御工事面前，美联社二日电承认：它们的炮火作用不大，“这不能使联军取得三角山，甚至还不能援救邻近的珍妮露赛山”。该社汉城四日电说：朝中人民军队“筑成了一条铁的防线”。
    在这种形势下，侵朝美军第八军军长范佛里特在五日急急忙忙前往金化地区“视察”。然而就在同一天，合众社汉城电承认：“精疲力竭的南朝鲜步兵五日被共军的大炮和迫击炮的密集炮火赶出了三角山……”。在美国侵略军驱使下冒险反扑的李承晚伪军又一次遭到惨重的伤亡，狼狈溃退。
    李承晚伪军固然大批地做了美国侵略军的替死鬼，美国军队的伤亡同样在大量增加。从美国通讯社发出的消息中，可以看出美军所受到的打击不下于被美国侵略军当作牺牲品的李伪军。
    美国国际新闻社记者沙克尼在四日消息中报道了美军一个连被打得七零八落后的情况。他写道：“战斗停止了，他们正在计算伤亡。”“这一连中少掉了不少人，准尉克洛盖特叫队伍集合起来，看看那个还活着，那个死掉了……现在步兵们——那些还活着的——排起队来了，队伍里的人少得可怜，兵士们都是满面胡须，肮脏不堪，疲惫不堪；于是点名开始了。在点名中，许多人都永远不再回答了。约斯特上尉说：‘没有什么可说的。他们打中了我们。大部分人都躺在壕沟里，我必须去把他们叫起来战斗。随时都有大量的炮弹打来。似乎永远不会停止。’上等兵霍兰说：‘我们当中有许多新兵，……他们中间有许多人被打死了，因为他们不知道把头缩下来。’”这条消息中引述的美军官兵的谈话，清楚地说明了美军士气低沉以及因损失惨重人力不足而以新兵充当炮灰的窘态。
    美联社记者巴纳德三日透露出美军侦察队遭到痛击的情况。他写道：“两个在西点军校是同窗的尉官，上星期在连续的两晚上都死了。”古柏带了二十个人的前哨队“去侦察敌军占领的山头”。“中国军队埋伏好等待着，由三面向他们袭击”，这支美军狼狈溃逃，古柏“踩着了一个地雷，就被炸死了”，“其他的二十个人中，有六个死亡，十四个受伤”，也就是说全部被歼灭了。“约翰逊在第二晚带了一支前哨队去侦察同一个山头，他的前哨队也遭到中国军队的伏击，连约翰逊共有四人死亡，另有九人受伤。”
    在美国伤兵医院中，受了伤的美国士兵犹有余悸地谈论着他们的惨败，反映出这支不知为何而战的军队的厌战情绪。美国国际新闻社记者哈莫夫引述了一些这些伤兵的谈话：躺在床上的李奇上尉叙述他率军“前往援救只剩下几个人的一个连”，却同样被打得落花流水的战斗经过。他说：“我旁边的无线电报务员和排里的中士都阵亡了。那里根本没有藏身之处。中国兵发射的迫击炮弹一秒钟一发，可怕极了。”
    另一个伤兵、中士斯奈德说：“当我们向三角山进攻时，共军的大炮打得十分准确。炮弹不断落下来，士兵们应声倒地。一枚迫击炮炮弹穿过我的地堡顶打进来，我的背部被击中了。我们有五人被击中，一位中士被击毙。”他又说：“我原是可以在本月初轮换而启程回国的，但他们留我们在这里进行这次作战。为的是什么？”他说：“我很高兴我不再回到那里去了。”
    现在金化以北上甘岭附近地区的战斗仍在继续进行，我军到十一月二日止已歼敌一万五千三百多人。对于美国侵略军和李伪军在今后战斗中的命运，连美国通讯社都十分悲观，美联社二日电说：“重来只是支出而已，不会有什么收获的。”
