Using Soviet-made animal-drawn farm implements, the members of the Ma Qingfu Agricultural Production Cooperative in Xiangyang Village, Nehe County, Heilongjiang Province, have been farming meticulously and vigorously reclaiming wasteland for the past three years, more than doubling their cultivated land area and setting new records for large-scale wheat production for two consecutive years. Recently, when the reporter visited the Ma Qingfu Agricultural Production Cooperative, the male and female members introduced the situation of their organization using Soviet-made animal-drawn farm implements with extremely grateful and excited feelings. Li Jingzhou, an old labor model and leader in the use of Soviet-made animal-drawn farm implements, excitedly said: "Since the People's Government allocated Soviet-made animal-drawn farm implements, our farmers have been so fortunate! We have more land, more grain, and our lives are getting richer and richer."

The land around Xiangyang Village is fertile, with large tracts of wasteland that can be reclaimed into good farmland. However, in the old society, it was difficult to cultivate more land using old-fashioned farm implements. Ma Qingfu, the director of the agricultural production cooperative, recalled the past: "In the past, using old farm implements to cultivate the land, one laborer could only cultivate three or four *xiang* (one *xiang* equals 15 Chinese acres) per year, and they still had to work very hard. In the past, my family cultivated three *xiang* of land, and my wife and children had no rest, following the four-legged animals every step of the way; it was exhausting, how could we cultivate more land!" Today, being organized and having Soviet-made animal-drawn farm implements has brought about tremendous changes in production. In the spring of 1950, Ma Qingfu and his mutual aid team members began using Soviet-made animal-drawn farm implements, and in just two years, they reclaimed more than 150 *xiang* of wasteland. Now, the area cultivated by each laborer has increased from three or four *xiang* to eight or nine *xiang*, and the cultivation is more meticulous than before. In particular, the use of Soviet-made animal-drawn farm implements has greatly increased the enthusiasm of the team members for developing mutual aid production. Many farmers outside the team, seeing the advantages of the new farm implements, have asked to join their mutual aid team. Their mutual aid team quickly expanded from the original eight households to twenty-three households. In the winter of 1951, they reorganized the mutual aid team into an agricultural production cooperative, opening up all the cultivated land for joint cultivation. Now, the Ma Qingfu Agricultural Production Cooperative has 31 members, nearly three times more than before the use of new farm implements; the total cultivated land of the cooperative is now more than 290 *xiang*, and the total annual grain income has more than doubled compared to the past.

At the same time, Soviet-made animal-drawn farm implements have brought them advanced cultivation methods such as deep plowing, fine harrowing, flat planting, close planting, and timely sowing, which have fully provided the conditions for healthy growth of crops, thus rapidly increasing the yield per unit area year by year. Last year, the 90 *xiang* of wheat cultivated by the Ma Qingfu Agricultural Production Cooperative using Soviet-made animal-drawn farm implements created a new record of an average yield of 3,750 *jin* per *xiang*, an increase of about 70 percent compared to the wheat cultivated by local farmers using old plows; and won the bumper harvest award from the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government. This year, the wheat cultivated by them using Soviet-made animal-drawn farm implements has again achieved large-scale bumper harvests, with an average increase of 22.4 percent per *xiang* compared to last year, and about double the yield of wheat fields cultivated by local farmers using old plows.

The members especially feel that Soviet-made animal-drawn farm implements can save labor, produce good work, save effort, and fully exert labor efficiency. Wang Jingchun, a young member of the cooperative, proudly introduced to the reporter: This spring, the agricultural production cooperative used Soviet-made animal-drawn hay rakes, raking three or four carts of grass in one day; while ordinary farmers raking grass with manpower pulling a large rake only rake one cart per day. Before the wheat harvest this year, many farmers, seeing the vast wheat fields of the Ma Qingfu Agricultural Production Cooperative, thought that they would not be able to harvest them all; therefore, some were preparing to do short-term labor to help harvest, and some were preparing to pick up wheat ears in the fields. However, after the wheat harvest began, the Ma Qingfu Agricultural Production Cooperative dispatched three harvesters and harvested all 91 *xiang* of wheat in seven days, and the harvest was very clean. Now, many mutual aid teams with better conditions are actively preparing to use Soviet-made animal-drawn farm implements next year.

In the past few years, the members of the Ma Qingfu Agricultural Production Cooperative have used Soviet-made animal-drawn farm implements to develop production, and their economic lives have greatly exceeded those of ordinary mutual aid team farmers. Ma Qingfu, the director of this agricultural production cooperative, and Zhang Baofu, the year-round mutual aid team leader, are neighbors, and they were allocated the same amount of land during the land reform; their families are also about the same size, with one person working in each family. In the past, they each led a mutual aid team. But now, new and old farm implements have made a big difference in their production and life: In the past three years, Ma Qingfu's land has increased sixfold, and now he has 21 *xiang* of cultivated land, one horse, two cows, and a large cart; the four members of his family all have four sets of summer clothes and two sets of winter clothes; the husband and wife each have a set of underwear; Ma Qingfu also has two leather coats because he often goes out. And Zhang Baofu has only increased his land by seven *mu* in these three years. Now he has five *xiang* and one *mu* of land, two horses, and his annual grain income is less than half of Ma Qingfu's, and the whole family can only maintain a life of adequate food and clothing. Now, every member of the Ma Qingfu Agricultural Production Cooperative is living a prosperous life. Li Lianhe, a member of the cooperative, was a poor farmer who had nothing in the past, but now he also has two horses and three cows, and has surplus grain every year, and his whole family is living a happy and prosperous life.

In the past few years, the members of the Ma Qingfu Agricultural Production Cooperative have deeply realized the great significance of Chairman Mao's teaching, "The Communist Party of the Soviet Union is our best teacher, and we must learn from the Communist Party of the Soviet Union," in the process of using Soviet-made animal-drawn farm implements to develop production. Every member loves the Soviet Union from the bottom of their hearts and is determined to learn from the Soviet Union. Now they are all members of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association. Recently, they are also preparing to learn advanced Soviet cultivation methods and carry out autumn plowing on nearly 100 *xiang* of cultivated land, in order to further increase grain production and strive to strengthen the country's economic construction.

    苏联马拉机械农具给农民带来了幸福
    ——马庆福农业生产合作社使用苏联马拉机械农具生产面貌日新月异
    新华社记者  高方
    黑龙江省讷河县向阳村马庆福农业生产合作社的社员们使用苏联马拉机械农具，三年来，精细地耕作，努力开垦荒地，已使耕地面积扩大了一倍以上，并连续两年创造了小麦大面积丰产新纪录。最近，记者访问马庆福农业生产合作社时，男女社员们都以极其感激和兴奋的心情，介绍了他们组织起来使用苏联马拉机械农具的情景。使用苏联机械马拉农具的带头人、老劳动模范李景州兴奋地说：“从人民政府拨来苏联马拉机械农具后，咱们庄稼人的福气可大啦！土地多了，粮食多了，生活越过越富裕。”
    向阳村一带的土地肥沃，有大片的荒原可以开垦为良田。但在旧社会里，使用旧式农具耕作，要多种一些地是很困难的。农业生产合作社主任马庆福回忆起往日的情景说：“从前用旧农具种地，一个劳动力每年只种三、四垧地（每垧十五市亩），还得紧忙侍弄。过去我家种了三垧地，老婆孩子都不得消停，每天跟着四条腿的牲口一步也不少走；把人累的够呛，哪还能多种地呢！”今天组织起来加上有了苏联马拉机械农具，生产面貌就起了巨大变化。一九五零年春天，马庆福和他的互助组员们开始使用苏联马拉机械农具，仅仅两年就开垦了一百五十多垧荒地。现在，每个劳动力耕种的面积已由三、四垧增加到八、九垧，耕种得比以往还要细致。特别是使用苏联马拉机械农具后，组员们大大提高了发展互助生产的热情。组外的许多农民看到新农具好，纷纷要求参加他们的互助组。他们的互助组便很快地由原有的八户扩大到二十三户。一九五一年冬天，他们便把互助组改组成为农业生产合作社，把所有耕地都打开地界耕种。现在，马庆福农业生产合作社共有社员三十一户，比使用新农具前扩大了将近三倍；现在全社的耕地已有二百九十多垧，每年粮食总收入比过去增加一倍多。
    苏联马拉机械农具同时给他们带来了苏联的深耕、细耙、平作、密植和适时播种等先进的耕作方法，使农作物充分地得到了健壮生长的条件，因而单位面积产量逐年迅速提高。去年，马庆福农业生产合作社用苏联马拉机械农具耕种的九十垧小麦，创造了平均每垧产麦三千七百五十斤的丰产新纪录，比当地农民用旧犁耕种的小麦增产百分之七十左右；获得了中央人民政府农业部的丰产奖励。今年他们用苏联马拉机械农具耕种的小麦，又获得了大面积的丰产，平均每垧比去年增产百分之二十二点四，比当地农民用旧犁耕种的麦田增产一倍左右。
    社员们特别感到苏联马拉机械农具可以省工、出活、省力，能充分发挥劳动效率。青年社员王景春自豪地向记者介绍：今年春天农业生产合作社用苏联马拉搂草机，一天搂了三、四车草；而一般农民用人拉着大筢搂草，一天只搂一车。今年麦收前，许多农民看到马庆福农业生产合作社一望无际的大片麦田，认为一定割不过来；因此有的准备做短工帮割，有的准备到地里拣麦穗。但是，麦收开始后，马庆福农业生产合作社出动了三台收割机，七天内就把九十一垧小麦全部割完了，而且收割得非常干净。现在，许多条件较好的互助组，都积极准备，明年也要用上苏联马拉机械农具。
    马庆福农业生产合作社的社员们，几年来使用了苏联马拉机械农具发展生产，经济生活已大大超过了一般互助组的农民。这个农业生产合作社的主任马庆福和常年互助组组长张宝福，他们两家是近邻，在土地改革时分得一样多的土地；两家人口也差不多，都是一个人干活，他们两人过去都各领导一个互助组。但现在呢，新、旧农具使他们在生产和生活上发生了很大的差别：三年来，马庆福的土地增加了六倍，现在他已有二十一垧耕地、一匹马、两头牛和一台大车；一家四口都有四套夏衣和两套冬衣；夫妻俩还各有一套卫生衣；马庆福因为常常外出，一人还有两身皮大衣。而张宝福在这三年中，土地只增加七亩。现在他有土地五垧一亩，马两匹，每年粮食收入只有马庆福的一半不到，全家只能维持衣食无缺的生活。现在，马庆福农业生产合作社的每个社员都过着富裕的生活。社员李连和从前是一无所有的贫苦农民，现在也有两匹马和三头牛，而且年年有余粮，全家过着美满富裕的生活。
    马庆福农业生产合作社的社员们，几年来使用苏联马拉机械农具的过程中，已深刻体会到毛主席教导的“联共就是我们的最好的先生，我们必须向联共学习”的伟大意义，每个社员都从心里热爱着苏联，决心向苏联学习。现在他们都是中苏友好协会的会员。最近，他们又准备学习苏联先进耕作方法，在近百垧的耕地上实行秋耕，以便进一步提高粮食产量，为加强祖国的经济建设而奋斗。
