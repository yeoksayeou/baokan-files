    The housing shortage in Britain has been severe since the war, but the British government has spent billions of pounds on expanding its military and preparing for war, while allocating only a negligible amount for housing construction. Currently, more than 200,000 families in London still do not have adequate housing, more than 100,000 in Glasgow, and about 200,000 in Manchester. The "Worker's Daily" reported on the appalling living conditions of thousands of families. A disabled veteran named Charlick, his wife, and four children have been living in a wartime air-raid shelter for several years.

    英国的房荒严重伦敦二十万家没房子住
    英国战后房荒一直严重，但英国政府以几十亿英镑用于扩军备战，却只以微不足道的数目拨作房屋建筑经费。目前，伦敦仍有二十多万家没有适当的房子住，格拉斯哥有十万多家，曼彻斯特约有二十万家。“工人日报”报道了数以千计的家庭的可怕的居住情况。一个残废退伍军人查里克、他的妻子和四个孩子，几年来一直住在一个战时的防空洞里。
