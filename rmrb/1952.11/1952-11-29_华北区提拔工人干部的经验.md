    Experiences in Promoting Worker-Cadres in North China
    Cadre Management Department of the Organization Department of the North China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee
    The work of promoting worker-cadres in North China has achieved remarkable results. According to incomplete statistics, nearly 10,000 worker-cadres have been promoted in various factories and mines this year, including: more than 2,300 in Tianjin, 1,800 in Beijing, 2,000 in Shanxi, 1,500 in Hebei, and more than 400 each in Pingyuan, Suiyuan, Chahar, and the Tianjin Railway Administration. This has rapidly filled the cadre vacancies in various factories and mines before and after the "Three-Anti" Movement, established and improved organizational structures, and adjusted and improved the cadre composition in factory and mining enterprises. According to statistics from five factories and mines in Beijing, Tianjin, and Tangshan, worker-cadres accounted for only 15 percent of the 2,548 cadres before the "Three-Anti" Movement, but increased to 30 percent after the "Three-Anti" Movement. In Beijing Shijingshan Power Plant, Tianjin Hengda Cigarette Factory, Tangshan Railway Factory, and other units, the proportion of worker-cadres has reached 40 to 50 percent. The promotion of a large number of worker-cadres has enabled the leadership of various factories and mines to further rely on the working class ideologically and organizationally, thereby further promoting the workers' sense of ownership and improving their labor enthusiasm and creativity, bringing about a new atmosphere in the production of various factories and mines. Cai Yingjie, the newly promoted deputy section chief of the Material Section of Tianjin No. 1 State-owned Cotton Mill, adopted workers' rationalization proposals and launched a "using old materials, saving funds" conservation campaign, saving the country 3.6 billion yuan. Liu Guanqing, a worker in the Electromechanical Section of Zhaogezhuang Mine of Kailuan Mining Bureau, was promoted to cadre and successfully organized workers to imitate the production of wind hammers, which greatly solved the difficulties of underground coal mining. Worker-cadres of Yangquan Iron Plant in Shanxi, after carefully analyzing the quality of various cokes, broke the saying that "Taiyuan coke cannot be used for iron smelting," solved the problem of the factory's coke supply being untimely, and saved the country 1.2 billion yuan.
    The methods used by various factories and mines to promote worker-cadres generally involve first criticizing various erroneous ideas of not believing in the working class among cadres, and conducting vivid education with concrete examples. For example, some cadres believe that workers have low education, poor skills, and little experience, and cannot do the job if they are promoted; others believe that promoting skilled workers will affect production, and so on. In response to such erroneous ideas, the leadership in various places, in addition to criticizing them theoretically, also selected typical examples for education. For example, after Xia Songlin, a foreman of the Beijing Engineering Section of the Tianjin Railway Administration, was promoted to deputy section chief and road maintenance director, many technical cadres believed that Xia Songlin's technical and educational level was low and that he could not shoulder such an important task. At this time, it happened that Dongbianmen needed an emergency rail replacement, and the section chief, who was an engineer, felt helpless for a while, but Xia Songlin believed that he was confident in completing this task. Because Xia Songlin had rich on-site work experience, coupled with the joint efforts of all the workers, the rail replacement work at Dongbianmen was completed ahead of schedule. The leading comrades used this example to educate the cadres, so that many cadres in this section changed their original views. Second, boldly promoting is combined with careful examination, and leadership's top-down examination is combined with mass's bottom-up recommendation. Under the leadership of the Party organization, each factory under the North China Textile Administration established a research and review group for promoting cadres, and formulated specific conditions for promoting cadres. First, meetings of cadres and activists of various systems were held in the workshops to initially select the objects of promotion, and then the conditions were announced to mobilize the workers and masses to discuss. In the discussion, some workers proposed: "Although so-and-so is good at work, there are still some historical problems that have not been explained." Some put forward some outstanding elements that had not been discovered by the leadership. The cadre promotion research and review group conducted a meticulous review based on the results of mass discussion, put forward preliminary opinions, and then submitted them to the higher authorities for approval. This method achieved the purpose of correctly selecting and promoting cadres, and also educated the broad masses of workers. Many workers began to measure themselves against the conditions for cadres, and urgently demanded to learn political, cultural, and professional knowledge. Third, promotion work is combined with daily training work. Tangshan Power Plant and Kailuan Zhaogezhuang Coal Mine have adopted a variety of methods to cultivate and train worker-cadres in a planned way, such as sending a large number of outstanding workers to municipal worker schools to study; running cultural remedial classes, spare-time technical crash courses, and training classes for Party members and League members in the factory; and adding deputy positions in various work posts, and adopting methods such as master-apprentice teaching. In the past three years, Tangshan Power Plant and Zhaogezhuang Coal Mine have trained nearly 500 worker-cadres. The number of people trained by Tangshan Electric Power Bureau using the above methods accounted for 80 percent of the total number of employees. This laid a favorable foundation for the mass promotion of worker-cadres.
    Since the "Three-Anti" Movement, although the work of promoting worker-cadres in North China has achieved the above-mentioned results, some leading cadres in some factories and mines have not fully implemented the spirit of mass promotion of worker-cadres, and they are timid and dare not let go of promoting cadres, and the purely emphasizing technical viewpoints has not been completely overcome. Some have not been able to regard discovering talents as their regular and important task. In addition, the leading comrades in various places have not done enough to provide regular education and specific guidance to the newly promoted worker-cadres, so that many cadres feel that they have poor ability, are not familiar with their business, have a low level of education, and have many difficulties in their work. The above problems should arouse the serious attention of leading cadres in various places.

    华北区提拔工人干部的经验
    中共中央华北局组织部干部管理处
    华北区提拔工人干部的工作，已取得显著成绩。据不完全的统计，今年以来各厂矿共提拔工人干部将近万人，计：天津二千三百余人，北京一千八百余人，山西二千人，河北一千五百余人，平原、绥远、察哈尔与天津铁路管理局各四百余人，迅速补充了“三反”运动前后各工厂矿山中的干部缺额，建立和健全了组织机构，调整和改善了厂矿企业中的干部成份。据北京、天津、唐山的五个厂矿的统计，在二千五百四十八个干部中，工人干部在“三反”运动前只占百分之十五，“三反”后即增到百分之三十。北京石景山发电厂、天津恒大烟厂、唐山铁路工厂等工人干部的比重，已达到百分之四十到百分之五十。由于大批工人干部的提拔，使各厂矿的领导从思想上、组织上进一步依靠了工人阶级，从而更加促进了工人的主人翁自觉，提高了工人的劳动积极性和创造性，使各厂矿在生产上出现了新气象。国营天津棉纺一厂新提拔的材料科副科长蔡应杰，采用工人合理化建议，发动了“用旧料，节资金”的节约竞赛，给国家节省了三十六亿元的财富。开滦矿务总局赵各庄矿机电科工人刘冠卿被提拔为干部后，发动工人仿制风锤成功，给井下采煤解决了很大困难。山西阳泉铁厂的工人干部，在仔细分析了各种焦炭的质量以后，打破了“太原焦炭不能炼铁”的说法，解决了该厂焦炭供应不及时的困难，并替国家节约十二亿元。
    各厂矿提拔工人干部的方法，一般是首先在干部中批判各种不相信工人阶级的错误思想，并用具体事例进行活的教育。如有的干部认为工人文化低，技术差、经验少，提拔起来干不了；有的认为提拔了技术工人会影响生产等。各地领导对此种错误思想，除从理论上进行批判外，同时还选择典型事例进行教育。例如天津铁路管理局北京工务段领工夏松林被提拔为工务段副段长兼养路主任后，曾有不少技术干部认为夏松林的技术、文化水平都低，不能担负这样重大的任务。这时候，恰巧遇上东便门需要紧急换轨，工程师出身的段长一时感到束手无策，但夏松林认为有把握完成这一任务。因为夏松林有丰富的现场工作经验，再加上全体工友的协同努力，东便门的换轨工作就提前完成。领导同志就拿这个例子在干部中进行教育，使这个段的许多干部改变了自己原来的看法。第二、大胆提拔与慎重审查相结合，领导自上而下的审查和群众自下而上的推荐相结合。华北纺织管理局所属各厂，在党组织的领导下，都成立了提拔干部的研究审查小组，拟定了提拔干部的具体条件。首先在车间召开各系统干部和积极分子的会议，初步挑选出提拔的对象，然后公布条件，发动职工群众讨论。在讨论中，有的工人提出：“某人工作上虽然不错，但历史上有些问题还没有交代。”有的提出了未被领导方面发现的一些优秀分子。提拔干部研究审查小组根据群众讨论的结果进行细密的审查，提出初步意见，再呈请上级批准。这种方法达到了正确挑选与提拔干部的目的，同时也教育了广大职工群众。许多工人开始以干部条件来衡量自己，迫切地要求学习政治、文化和业务知识。第三、提拔工作与日常的培养工作相结合。唐山发电厂、开滦赵各庄煤矿，为了有计划地培养训练工人干部，曾采取了多种多样、齐头并进的培养方法，如选送大批优秀职工到市职工学校学习；本厂举办文化补习班、业余技术速成班、党员和团员训练班；以及在各个工作岗位上增设副职，采取师傅带徒弟等办法。三年来唐山发电厂和赵各庄煤矿培养工人干部将近五百人。唐山电业局用以上方法培养训练的人数占职工总数的百分之八十。这就给大量提拔工人干部打下了有利的基础。
    华北区提拔工人干部的工作自“三反”运动以来，虽获得以上成绩，但是仍有一些厂矿的领导干部对大量提拔工人干部的精神贯彻不够，小手小脚、不敢放手提拔干部，单纯强调技术观点还未完全克服。有的尚未能把发现人才当做自己经常的重要的任务。此外，各地领导同志对新提拔的工人干部的经常教育与具体指导还作得不够，致使不少干部觉得自己能力差、业务不熟悉、文化程度低、工作上有许多困难。以上问题应引起各地领导干部的严重注意。
