Xinhua News Agency, New York, 26th: The Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly held meetings on November 21st and 22nd to continue discussing the Korean issue.

Speaking at the November 21st meeting were representatives from Australia, Costa Rica, Indonesia, and Czechoslovakia.

Australian representative Spender's speech reflected the unease caused by the UN's discussion of the Korean issue. He said: Vyshinsky's arguments have left a deep impression on the heads of some delegations. Spender said: Vyshinsky's arguments are also being cited outside the committee meeting room, being used to convince certain delegations that those negotiating at Panmunjom are violating international law. This Australian representative warned: There is a danger of retreating and withdrawing from the original claims regarding the repatriation of prisoners of war. In other words: Spender demanded support for the US military command's refusal to repatriate Korean and Chinese prisoners of war.

It can be seen from the Australian representative's speech that the US delegation's attempt to gather the necessary votes to force the committee to accept the US proposal has failed. The Australian representative said: The committee should set aside all proposals, including the US proposal, and concentrate on producing a proposal for the repatriation of prisoners of war. He pointed out that the Indian proposal, if amended, could form the basis of this proposal. The Australian representative supported Eden's amendment to the Indian proposal.

Just as the representatives of the US-British bloc countries were delivering hypocritical speeches about "love of peace" at the Political Committee meeting, American newspapers frankly wrote that reaching a Korean armistice was less of a political issue and more of a military one, and that this issue must be decided according to the recommendations of the military authorities. American newspaper reports showed that the US ruling clique was unwilling to stop the Korean War. The "New York Times" emphasized on November 22nd that neither Eisenhower nor future Secretary of State Dulles believed that a Korean armistice could be reached based on any proposal put forward at the United Nations General Assembly.

It is understandable that the Australian representative also hypocritically talked about "love of peace" but actually expressed unwillingness to make any efforts to reach an agreement on a Korean armistice.

The Costa Rican representative then spoke in support of the US proposal.

Indonesian delegation leader Pala, in his speech, emphasized that the committee must make a resolution acceptable to both sides of the Korean War. Although he pointed out that the Soviet proposal aimed to solve the entire Korean issue, he avoided discussing the proposal.

Czechoslovak representative Komsala delivered a comprehensive speech. He pointed out that the UN's discussion of the Korean issue without inviting representatives from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the People's Republic of China could not promote a fair and unbiased resolution of the issue.

He criticized the US proposal aimed at undermining the armistice negotiations and prolonging the Korean War. He also pointed out that the delegations of the United States and some other countries—the partners in the US aggression against Korea—were deliberately distorting the basic principles of international law and the provisions of the Geneva Convention regarding the exchange of prisoners of war in the Political Committee. The Czechoslovak representative listed several articles of the Geneva Convention, explaining that the delegations of the Soviet Union, Ukraine, Belarus, Poland, and Czechoslovakia were very correctly defending the principles of the Geneva Convention.

Komsala emphasized the importance of the Soviet proposal. He concluded by saying: For the sake of peace, justice, and respect for international obligations, the Czechoslovak delegation firmly supports the Soviet delegation's proposal. The Czechoslovak delegation is convinced that the representatives of all countries that sincerely desire an end to the Korean War and that the United Nations become an organization for maintaining peace and international security will support the Soviet proposal.

At the November 22nd meeting, Ukrainian delegation leader Baranovky delivered a speech. He pointed out that the Political Committee's discussion on the Korean issue had definitively proved that the US ruling clique had turned the issue of repatriating prisoners of war into an artificial obstacle preventing the smooth conclusion of the Korean armistice negotiations. The Political Committee's discussion showed that disagreements on the issue of repatriating prisoners of war existed not only between the Soviet Union and the US-British bloc, but also between the drafters of the US proposal—mainly those countries that intervened in Korea—and many other delegations, and that these disagreements occurred on major issues, not minor ones. At this session of the United Nations General Assembly, the attitude adopted by a considerable number of delegations on the Korean issue showed that the policies pursued by US imperialism in Korea were condemned by the broad masses of people, and that the influence of the broad masses of people was clearly manifested even within the United Nations during the discussion. Considering this situation, and considering that the US proposal's overly explicit demand for approval of the US military command's illegal claims in the Korean armistice negotiations would scare away certain delegations, the US-British bloc used conspiracies and tricks to deceive public opinion. They did not dare to openly oppose the Geneva Convention, and they wanted to exploit loopholes in this international convention, attempting to evade the provisions of this convention.

Baranovky said: The US-British bloc is unwilling to end the Korean War and is still trying to continue and expand its aggression. Under these circumstances, the United Nations, especially a portion of the countries within the United Nations that eagerly hope to end the Korean War, must find a basis for an acceptable resolution to the Korean issue. He emphasized that the Soviet proposal is the basis for resolving the Korean issue.

Representatives from Bolivia and Iraq spoke at the meeting in support of the Indian proposal.

### 捷克斯洛伐克和乌克兰代表在联大政委会上发言  主张以苏联提案作为解决朝鲜问题的基础

    捷克斯洛伐克和乌克兰代表在联大政委会上发言
    主张以苏联提案作为解决朝鲜问题的基础
    【新华社二十六日讯】据塔斯社纽约讯：联合国大会政治委员会于十一月二十一、二十二日举行会议，继续讨论朝鲜问题。
    在二十一日会议上发言的有澳大利亚、哥斯达黎加、印尼和捷克斯洛伐克代表。
    澳大利亚代表斯宾德的发言，反映了在联合国讨论朝鲜问题的过程中所引起的不安。他说：维辛斯基的论点给某些代表团团长留下了深刻的印象。斯宾德说：维辛斯基的论点在委员会会议厅以外也被人引用，被人用来使某些代表团相信在板门店进行谈判的人们违反了国际法。这位澳大利亚代表警告说：有从原来关于遣返战俘的主张上让步和撤退的危险。换句话说：斯宾德要求支持美军司令部拒绝遣返朝中战俘的主张。
    从澳大利亚代表的发言中可以看出，美国代表团想纠集到必要的票数来强迫委员会接受美国提案的企图已经失败了。澳大利亚代表说：委员会应该把包括美国提案在内的一切提案都搁在一边，而集中力量来搞出一个关于遣返战俘的提案。他指出：印度的提案假如经过一番修正的话，便可以构成这一个提案的基础。澳大利亚代表支持艾登对印度提案的修正。
    正当美英集团国家的代表们在政治委员会的会议上发表关于他们“爱好和平”的伪善演说时，美国报纸却坦白地写道：达成朝鲜停战与其说是一个政治问题，不如说是一个军事问题，这个问题必须依照军事当局的建议作决定。美国报纸的报道表明美国统治集团不愿停止朝鲜战争。“纽约时报”在十一月二十二日强调说：无论艾森豪威尔或未来的国务卿杜勒斯都不认为可以根据在联合国大会上提出的任何提案达成朝鲜停战。
    澳大利亚代表也伪善地谈论“爱好和平”，但实际上却表示不愿作任何努力，以期达成关于朝鲜停战的协定，这是可以理解的。
    接着发言的哥斯达黎加代表支持美国的提案。
    印尼代表团团长巴拉在演说开始时强调说：委员会必须作出一个可以为朝鲜战争双方接受的决议。虽然他指出苏联的提案旨在解决朝鲜的整个问题，但是他却避免谈论这个提案。
    捷克斯洛伐克代表康萨拉发表了一篇内容丰富的演说。他指出联合国讨论朝鲜问题时没有邀请朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和中华人民共和国的代表参加，这种情况不能促成这个问题得到公正的、没有偏见的解决。
    他抨击旨在破坏停战谈判和延长朝鲜战争的美国提案。他并且指出美国和其他一些国家——美国侵略朝鲜的伙伴——的代表团在政治委员会中故意歪曲国际法的基本原则和日内瓦公约关于交换战俘的规定。捷克斯洛伐克代表列举日内瓦公约的若干条款，说明苏联、乌克兰、白俄罗斯、波兰和捷克斯洛伐克的代表团正在非常正确地保卫着日内瓦公约的原则。
    康萨拉强调指出苏联提案的重要性。他最后说：为了和平、正义并尊重国际义务，捷克斯洛伐克代表团坚决支持苏联代表团的提案。捷克斯洛伐克代表团确信：凡是真诚愿望朝鲜战争停止、愿望联合国成为维护和平与国际安全的机构的国家的代表，都会支持苏联的提案。
    在二十二日会议上，乌克兰代表团团长巴拉诺夫斯基发表演说。他指出，政治委员会关于朝鲜问题的讨论已经肯定地证明：美国统治集团已经把遣返战俘问题变成了阻止朝鲜停战谈判顺利结束的一个人为的障碍。政治委员会的讨论显示出在遣返战俘问题上的意见分歧，不仅存在于苏联和美英集团之间，而且也存在于美国提案的起草人——主要是那些干涉朝鲜的国家——与其他许多代表团之间，而且这种分歧发生在主要问题上，而不是在次要问题上。在联合国大会本届会议上，相当一部分代表团在朝鲜问题上采取的态度，表明了美帝国主义者在朝鲜实行的政策受到广大人民群众的斥责，在联合国讨论的期间，广大人民群众的影响甚至在联合国里也明显地表现了出来。美英集团考虑到这种情况，并且考虑到美国提案过度公开地要求批准美军司令部在朝鲜停战谈判中的非法主张，会把某些代表团吓跑，于是它们使用了阴谋诡计，来欺骗舆论。他们不敢公开反对日内瓦公约，他们想在这个国际公约上钻空子，企图逃避这个公约的规定。
    巴拉诺夫斯基说：美英集团不愿意结束朝鲜战争，并且还在竭力来继续并扩大它的侵略。在这种情况之下，联合国，首先是联合国中一部分热切希望结束朝鲜战争的国家，必须寻找一个可以被接受的解决朝鲜问题的基础。他着重指出，苏联提案就是解决朝鲜问题的基础。
    玻利维亚和伊拉克代表在会上发言支持印度提案。
