    Trygve Lie Announces Resignation as "UN Secretary-General"
    Reflecting Failure of US Dictatorial Policy
    [Xinhua News Agency, New York, 15th] Trygve Lie announced his decision to resign from the post of "UN Secretary-General" at the plenary session of the UN General Assembly on November 10th. Lie's action demonstrates the failure of the US dictatorial policy in the United Nations.
    Lie is known as a henchman of the US State Department. His disgraceful record during his tenure as UN Secretary-General since 1946 fully illustrates that he was an obedient servant of the US ruling clique. He enthusiastically supported the US government's measures to undermine the UN Charter and transform the UN into a tool of American war. He tried his best to help the United States cover up its aggression against Korea in the name of the United Nations, and defended the US's crimes of obstructing the Korean armistice negotiations and conducting bacteriological warfare. Following behind his American masters, he repeatedly urged the US-British bloc countries to provide more cannon fodder to serve as substitutes for the US troops invading Korea. Precisely because he lacked the basic impartiality that is required of the UN Secretary-General, he had long lost the trust of many member states of the United Nations. Especially after the United States manipulated the UN General Assembly in 1950 to illegally extend Lie's term for three years, the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies refused to recognize him as the UN Secretary-General. Lie's various activities during his illegal tenure as UN Secretary-General further exposed his true colors and were despised by all peace-loving countries and people in the world. Lie's resignation before the expiration of his illegal term is an admission of his complete political bankruptcy.
    The bankruptcy of this political speculator, Trygve Lie, is actually a reflection of the failure of the United States' hegemonic policy in the United Nations. In 1950, the United States disregarded everything in order to keep Lie, this docile tool, in the position of UN Secretary-General, attempting to completely transform the United Nations into an organ for implementing American war policies against peace. US Assistant Secretary of State Rusk arrogantly stated in a speech on October 24th of the same year: "We are the United Nations. There is no great organization at Lake Success (then the address of the United Nations). When we refer to the United Nations, we are referring to ourselves." However, in the past two years, this dictatorial policy of the United States has encountered increasing difficulties in the United Nations. It has not only been firmly opposed by the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies, but also encountered growing dissatisfaction and resistance from many countries in the US-British bloc. This situation is particularly evident at the current Seventh Session of the United Nations General Assembly in New York. Even US Secretary of State Acheson admitted in a speech on October 21st of this year that this session of the General Assembly is "a particularly difficult session." It is in this situation that the United States has had to consider replacing its docile but already deceptive tool.

### 赖伊宣布辞去“联合国秘书长”职  反映美独裁政策失败

    赖伊宣布辞去“联合国秘书长”职
    反映美独裁政策失败
    【新华社十五日讯】纽约消息：赖伊于十一月十日在联合国大会全体会议上宣布他决定辞去“联合国秘书长”的职务。赖伊的这个行动，表现出美国在联合国中独裁政策的失败。
    赖伊是以美国国务院的侍从长著称的。他自一九四六年以来担任联合国秘书长职务期间的可耻记录，充分说明他是美国统治集团百依百顺的奴仆。他热心地支持美国政府破坏联合国宪章、变联合国为美国战争工具的各项措施。他竭力帮助美国以联合国的名义来掩饰美国对朝鲜的侵略，并替美国阻挠朝鲜停战谈判及进行细菌战的罪恶行为辩解。他还跟在美国主子的后面，一再敦促美英集团各国提供更多的炮灰来充当美国侵朝军队的替死鬼，正是因为他丝毫也没有担任联合国秘书长这个职务所必须有的起码的公正态度，他早就失去了联合国许多会员国的信任。特别是在一九五○年美国操纵联合国大会非法延长赖伊任期三年以后，苏联及人民民主国家就不承认他是联合国秘书长。赖伊在非法担任联合国秘书长期间的种种活动，也更加使其面目毕露，而为全世界一切爱好和平的国家及人民所不齿。赖伊在非法任期尚未届满前就提出辞职，正是承认了他在政治上已完全破产。
    而赖伊这个政治投机家的破产，实际上也就是美国在联合国中专横政策遭到失败的一种反映。一九五○年时，美国不顾一切地要把赖伊这个温驯的工具继续放在联合国秘书长的职位上，企图彻底变联合国为执行美国战争政策反对和平的机关。美国助理国务卿鲁斯克在同年十月二十四日发表的演说中即狂妄地说：“我们就是联合国。在成功湖（当时联合国的地址）并没有什么伟大的组织。当我们指联合国时，那就是指的我们自己。”但是，两年来，美国这种独裁政策在联合国中已遭到越来越大的困难。它不仅为苏联及人民民主国家所坚决反对，而且也遇到美英集团中许多国家日益增长的不满与反抗。这种情况在目前纽约举行的联合国第七届大会上尤其显著。连美国国务卿艾奇逊今年十月二十一日发表的演说中也承认：这届大会是“特别困难的一届大会”。正是在这样的形势下，美国不得不考虑撤换它这个驯服的但已经失去欺骗作用的工具。
