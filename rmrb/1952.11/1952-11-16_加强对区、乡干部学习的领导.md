    Strengthen Leadership in the Study of District and Township Cadres
    Editor: I am a cadre of the Xuzhou Municipal People's Government. Recently, I spoke with a comrade working in rural areas. He said, "We are learning too poorly down here. We are running from village to village every day, and there is no system. We have meetings until midnight, and when we get up in the morning, we go straight to work. If we occasionally have some free time, we don't feel like studying. As a result, we can't keep up with the development of the situation, and we are far behind the cadres in the city." The situation reflected by this comrade is indeed quite common. I have spent a lot of time working in rural areas and have seen that the study of district and township cadres is indeed not very good. Sometimes they study for an hour or two, and the discussion goes off topic after a few digressions. The learning gains are not great. However, there are also individual units that study well, studying for two hours every day, and the discussions are very lively. This is mainly because the leading cadres of these units are paying close attention and leading everyone in their studies by setting an example.
    Today, the situation is developing so rapidly that anyone who does not study will not be able to keep up with the development of the situation. Therefore, it is an urgent task for county and district leading cadres to conscientiously and specifically lead the study of district and township cadres.

    加强对区、乡干部学习的领导
    编辑同志：我是徐州市人民政府的一个干部，最近和一个农村工作的同志谈话，他说：“我们在下边学习太差了，天天这村跑那村，也没有什么制度。晚上开会到半夜，早晨起床就办公，偶尔有点空也无心学习。这样，我们对形势发展摸不着头，比在城里的干部就差远了。”这个同志反映的情况确是带有普遍性的。我曾有不少时间在农村工作，看到区、乡干部的学习的确不大好。他们有时学习个把钟头，讨论问题三扯两扯就离了题，学习收获是不大的。不过，也有个别单位学习得好的，每天都能学两个钟头，讨论怪热烈的，这主要是这些单位领导干部抓得紧，并以身作则领导大家学习的缘故。
    今天形势发展这么快，谁要是不学习谁就赶不上形势的发展。因此，县区领导干部认真地具体地领导区乡干部的学习，是迫不及待的任务。
