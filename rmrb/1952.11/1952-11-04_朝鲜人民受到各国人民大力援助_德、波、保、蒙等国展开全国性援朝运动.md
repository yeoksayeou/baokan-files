Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, November 3rd: The Korean people, in their anti-aggression war, are receiving support and assistance from peace-loving people all over the world. This support and assistance strongly encourages the Korean people's just struggle.

In the past year, the Korean War Disaster Relief Committee received more than 16 million items of aid from people of all countries. In addition, there were condolence funds equivalent to more than 64 million Korean won donated by the Chinese people, and more than 30,000 horses, cattle, sheep and other livestock donated by the Mongolian people.

In the first half of this year, the Korean War Disaster Relief Committee received 12,948 tons of grain and food, more than 49,600 boxes and 6,800 sacks of clothing, more than 2,400 boxes of medicine, and 50,000 tons of flour. In the second half of this year, aid supplies sent by people of various countries have reached more than 100 train cars per month. The 500,000 cotton-padded coats, 500,000 winter hats, and 750,000 pairs each of sneakers and cotton shoes recently sent by the Chinese people to the Korean people have begun to arrive in succession. Most of the more than 70,000 livestock donated by the Mongolian people have been transported to Korea. All 150,000 consolation bags donated by the Hungarian people have been transported.

The working people and youth of France, Austria, West Germany, and Sweden, despite the obstruction of their respective governments, also sent gifts and condolence money.

In addition to these material aids, people of various countries have sent comfort groups and medical teams to Korea. Women from Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania and other countries have also fostered hundreds of Korean orphans. The Korean people have received tens of thousands of letters from all over the world, in which the people of various countries unanimously expressed their firm support for the just struggle of the Korean people.

In the various people's democratic countries, the Aid Korea movement has become a nationwide movement. Workers in the German Democratic Republic, Poland, Bulgaria, Mongolia and other countries have organized "Kim Il-sung Production Teams" and "Korean Workshops" in factories and mines, launching production increase competitions and frequently donating a portion of their increased income and wages to support the Korean people. Artists and athletes from various countries have held many performances and competitions to support Korea. The Romanian people regularly held "Aid Korea Week", and 250,000 people formed 500 gift collection teams to raise condolence money and aid supplies for the Korean people throughout the country. Women formed 794 collective work groups in eleven regions of the country, weaving cloth, socks, gloves, etc. to donate to Korean women. The Hungarian people held three "Korea Month" and "Korea Week" activities to aid Korea nationwide, raising 65 million forints (Hungarian currency) and sending a large amount of supplies to the Korean people. The Polish people raised more than 6 million zlotys (Polish currency) on International Labor Day alone. The broad masses of Mongolian people engaged in animal husbandry have donated livestock one after another. An old man who raised 120 livestock voluntarily donated 80 of them.

Xu Binglv, Deputy Secretary-General of the Korean War Disaster Relief Committee, said: These aid supplies, sent from thousands of miles away and intertwined with the noble friendship of internationalism, have played an extremely significant role in the just struggle of the Korean people. He said: Because the American aggressors are carrying out cruel destruction of peaceful cities and villages in Korea, our Korean people are encountering many difficulties in their lives. When we were in urgent need of food, people from all countries sent a lot of food, which enabled us to overcome the difficulties. In terms of winter clothing, our government has prepared a large amount of clothing, and with the large number of clothes, hats, shoes and socks sent by people from various countries, the winter clothing problem of our Korean workers, staff, agency workers and poor peasants has been basically solved. Among all the aid supplies, medical equipment and medicines also account for a large proportion, with a value of about 30 percent of the total value of the aid supplies. They effectively guaranteed the victory of our Korean people's anti-bacterial warfare and the conduct of epidemic prevention and health work. Xu Binglv pointed out: The internationalist aid from people of various countries has filled us with confidence in the victorious future of the Korean anti-aggression war. People from all walks of life in Korea, at rallies to receive or distribute aid supplies, have expressed their determination to vigorously support the front lines and to repay the support of peace-loving people all over the world with greater victories and achievements.

    【新华社平壤三日电】朝鲜人民在反侵略战争中受到全世界爱好和平的人民的支持和援助，这些支持和援助，有力地鼓舞了朝鲜人民的正义斗争。

    在各人民民主国家中，援助朝鲜运动已成为全国性的运动。德意志民主共和国、波兰、保加利亚、蒙古等国工人，纷纷在工厂矿山里组织“金日成生产小组”和“朝鲜车间”等，展开增产竞赛，经常把增产收入和工资的一部分捐出支援朝鲜人民。各国的艺术工作者和运动员们为支援朝鲜举行了许多次公演和比赛。罗马尼亚人民定期举行“支援朝鲜周”，并有二十五万人组成五百个礼物收集小组，在全国各地为朝鲜人民筹募慰问金和援助物资，妇女们在国内十一个地区组成七百九十四个集体工作组，编织布匹、袜子、手套等赠送给朝鲜妇女。匈牙利人民曾在全国范围内先后举行三次援助朝鲜的“朝鲜月”和“朝鲜周”，募集了六千五百万福林（匈币），给朝鲜人民送来了大批物资。波兰人民仅在“五一”国际劳动节那天就募集了六百多万兹罗提（波币）。蒙古从事牧畜业的广大人民，纷纷捐献牲畜。有一个老大爷饲养了一百二十头牲畜，自动献出了八十头。
