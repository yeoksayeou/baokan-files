    China National Committee for the Defence of Children
    Holds Reception for the China Welfare Institute Children's Theater Troupe Performing in Beijing
    The China National Committee for the Defence of Children recently held a tea party to receive the China Welfare Institute Children's Theater Troupe, which came to Beijing to perform.
    Those present at the tea party included Soong Ching Ling, Chairman of the China National Committee for the Defence of Children, Vice Chairmen Deng Yingchao and Fu Lianzhang, Secretary-General Kang Keqing, and Lin Liru, Director of the Department of General Education of the Central Ministry of Education.
    Kang Keqing presided over the tea party. First, Deng Yingchao delivered a speech on behalf of the China National Committee for the Defence of Children. She said: The Children's Theater Troupe has performed many wonderful programs in Beijing, providing children with a good education and receiving a warm welcome and praise from the audience. She hopes that the troupe will continue to work hard to serve the children, and that the relevant agencies and organizations will work together to develop children's literature and drama.
    Comrades from other units attending the tea party all praised the success of the troupe's performance in their speeches, and expressed that they will work together in the future to promote children's literature and drama. Ren Deyao, head of the Children's Theater Troupe, introduced the troupe's development at the meeting.
    Finally, Chairman Soong Ching Ling, on behalf of the China National Committee for the Defence of Children, presented the Children's Theater Troupe with a banner inscribed with "Strive to Develop Children's Literature and Drama".
    The Children's Theater Troupe was established in Shanghai in 1947 under the leadership of Soong Ching Ling, Chairman of the China Welfare Institute. Before liberation, the troupe's work was difficult to carry out due to oppression and obstruction by the Kuomintang reactionaries. After liberation, it received the support and care of the People's Government. The troupe currently has seventy children, twenty-two staff members, and more than ten part-time teachers. In addition to educating children through theatrical performances, the troupe also provides guidance to students in Shanghai schools and children's recreational activities in various districts.

    中国人民保卫儿童全国委员会
    招待来北京演出的中国福利会儿童剧团
    中国人民保卫儿童全国委员会日前举行茶会，招待来京演出的中国福利会儿童剧团。
    出席茶会的有中国人民保卫儿童全国委员会主席宋庆龄，副主席邓颖超、傅连暲，秘书长康克清，中央教育部普通教育司司长林砺儒等。
    茶会由康克清主持。首由邓颖超代表中国人民保卫儿童全国委员会致词。她说：儿童剧团在京演出许多精彩节目，给予儿童很好的教育，受到观众们热烈的欢迎和赞扬。她希望剧团继续努力为儿童服务，并希望各有关机关团体共同为发展儿童的文艺戏剧而努力。
    出席茶会的其他单位的同志在讲话中都一致赞扬该团演出的成功，并表示今后将共同努力推广儿童文艺戏剧。儿童剧团团长任德耀在会上介绍了该团发展情况。
    茶会最后由宋庆龄主席代表中国人民保卫儿童全国委员会将一面写着“为发展儿童文艺戏剧而努力”的奖旗，授给儿童剧团。
    儿童剧团是在中国福利会主席宋庆龄领导下于一九四七年在上海成立的。解放前，该团因受国民党反动派压迫和阻挠，工作难于开展。解放后，得到人民政府的支持和照顾。全团现有儿童七十人，工作人员二十二人，兼任教师十余人。该团除以演出戏剧的方式教育儿童外，还对上海市各校学生和各区儿童的文娱活动进行辅导工作。
