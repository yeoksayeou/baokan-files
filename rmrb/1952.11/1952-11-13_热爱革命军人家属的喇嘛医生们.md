    Lama Doctors Who Love Revolutionary Military Families
    Among the sixty-two Mongolian and Han revolutionary military families in the Second District of Junwang Banner, Ik Zhao League, Suiyuan Province, more than forty families mentioned in their letters to their sons participating in the People's Liberation Army or the Volunteer Army, with gratitude, how the doctors of the Second District Medical Cooperative cared for them. They all asked their relatives to do a good job in return for the care of the doctors.
    This medical cooperative was initiated by Awen Shilab, a Lama doctor from Baoertai Temple, in February last year. Shortly after the establishment of the cooperative, the People's Government called on the people of the whole country to do a good job in supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to military families. Awen Shilab and the thirty-two doctors in the cooperative (including twenty-five Lamas) immediately responded to the call and decided that each doctor would take care of several military families, visit them regularly, and provide free medical treatment when they were sick. If anyone brought a message to the doctors stationed in the medical center, saying that a military family member was ill, the doctors would immediately ride their horses to treat them, regardless of whether it was day or night, or windy or rainy. The mother of revolutionary soldier Kala Zeng contracted severe typhoid fever last autumn. After hearing about it, Awen Shilab and two other doctors braved the strong wind to treat her and took care of the patient day and night. When the patient recovered, she wanted to give money, but the doctors refused. When the patient wanted to give gifts, the doctors also politely declined. Later, she wrote a letter to her son about this matter, and Kala Zeng wrote a letter to the doctors saying: I will definitely work harder in the future to repay everyone's kindness.
    Initially, the doctors of the cooperative only provided free medical treatment to the military families in this district. Later, even military families from nearby banners and counties, and even Shenmu County in northern Shaanxi, came to see the doctor, and Awen Shilab did not allow them to pay for medical expenses. He said: "All the People's Liberation Army are the same, how can we treat their families differently!"
    During Mongolian and Han festivals, the medical cooperative also wrote letters of condolence to the military families and sent seasonal gifts. During temple fairs, they invited the military families to participate in the temple fairs as if they were receiving relatives. From June last year to now, the doctors have written letters of condolence to the Volunteer Army every month.
    Why do these Lama doctors have such deep feelings for the People's Liberation Army and the Volunteer Army, and care so much about their families? Awen Shilab has used his personal experience to answer this question more than once: Before liberation, although Lamas had a relatively high status and were respected in Mongolian society, they were still bullied by the Han chauvinists of the Kuomintang reactionaries. Before 1940, the Lamas of Baoertai Temple had to bury their valuables in the ravines and drive their livestock to escape during the day because the Kuomintang bandit troops were looting and plundering all day long. October 25, 1940, was the temple fair of Baoertai Temple, and the Lamas returned to the temple to perform ghost dances and chant scriptures. While it was lively, more than a thousand bandit soldiers surrounded the temple, rummaged through boxes and cabinets to rob things, and messed up the shrines; in the end, they also complained that there were too few things and beat the Lamas one by one. Awen Shilab's master, Sulong Buhe Lama, and Sheng Teng's heads were broken, and Awen Shilab's hat was also shot through by bandit soldiers' bullets. The situation became more and more serious. Before liberation, the Lamas did not dare to come back at night, so they had to chant scriptures and eat in the ravines.
    July 14, 1949, was the temple fair, and the Lamas were performing ghost dances when an army came from afar. Many Lamas ran away, and the old and weak Lamas who remained in the temple also changed into ragged clothes, nervously preparing to deal with this disaster. But it was the People's Liberation Army who came. They did not enter the temple and were very kind to people. The old Lamas felt that it was too unkind to treat such good people coldly, so they invited the People's Liberation Army comrades to the temple for dinner. After the meal, the People's Liberation Army insisted on paying the money, despite the Lamas' refusal. At this time, the old Lamas called back all the Lamas who had run away and put on good clothes to perform ghost dances again.
    This place was liberated. Since then, the property of the Lamas has been protected, and customs and religious beliefs have been respected. More importantly, the situation of the rapid decline in the population and livestock of the Mongolian people under the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang has changed, and what has begun to appear is a new atmosphere of prosperity for both people and livestock. This deeply moved Awen Shilab and all the Mongolian people. He said: "The People's Liberation Army and the Volunteer Army are the guardians of our happy life. Isn't it right for us to take care of their families!"

### 热爱革命军人家属的喇嘛医生们

    热爱革命军人家属的喇嘛医生们
    绥远省伊克昭盟郡王旗二区的六十二家蒙汉革命军人家属中，有四十多家在给他们参加解放军或志愿军的子弟写信时，怀着感激的心情提到二区医药合作社的医生们是怎样关心他们。他们都要求自己的亲人作好工作，来答谢医生们的关怀。
    这个医药合作社是由保尔太庙的喇嘛医生阿文史拉布在去年二月间发起创办的。合作社成立不久，正赶上人民政府号召全国人民作好拥军优属工作。阿文史拉布就和社里的三十二位医生（其中有二十五位喇嘛）立刻响应号召，决定每个医生分别照顾几家军属，经常去探望，遇有病人就免费医治。假若有谁给常驻医社的医生捎来口信，说是那个军属病了，不管是黑夜白天，或是刮风下雨，医生马上骑马赶去医治。革命军人喀拉增的母亲去年秋天得了很重的伤寒病。阿文史拉布和另外两位医生听说后，当即顶着大风赶去为她医治，并且不分昼夜地照顾着病人。病人病好了要给钱，医生们不要；病人想送礼，医生们也婉言谢绝了。后来她把这件事写信告诉儿子，喀拉增就给医生们写信说：今后一定更努力工作，来答谢大家的好意。
    最初，合作社的医生们还只是给本区的军属们免费看病，后来就是左近几个旗县，甚至陕北神木县的军属们来看病，阿文史拉布也不让收医药费了。他说：“全国的解放军都一个样，我们怎能对他们的家属不一样看待呢！”
    这个医药合作社每逢蒙汉佳节，还给军属们写慰问信，送应时的礼品；每逢庙会就像接亲戚一样，把军属们请去参加庙会。从去年六月到现在，医生们每月给志愿军写一次慰问信。
    这些喇嘛医生们为什么会对人民解放军和志愿军有这样深厚的感情，并这样关心着他们的家属呢？对这个问题，阿文史拉布曾经不止一次地用他的亲身经历来回答：解放前，喇嘛在蒙族社会里虽然是比较有地位和被人尊崇的，但仍受着国民党反动派大汉族主义者的欺凌。在一九四○年前，保尔太庙的喇嘛们就因国民党匪军整天抢劫掠夺，不得不把贵重东西埋在山沟里，白天赶上牲口去逃难。一九四○年十月二十五日是保尔太庙的庙会，喇嘛们都回到庙上去跳鬼、念经。正在热闹的时候，一千多个匪军把庙包围了，挨屋翻箱倒柜抢东西，把神龛也翻了个乱七八糟；最后还嫌东西太少，把喇嘛们挨个儿打了一顿。阿文史拉布的师傅速龙?布和喇嘛升腾的头都被打破了，阿文史拉布的帽子也被匪军枪弹打穿了。情况越来越严重。临解放时，喇嘛们晚上都不敢回来，只好在山沟里念经、吃饭。
    一九四九年七月十四日是庙会，喇嘛们正跳鬼，远远地来了一支军队。很多喇嘛吓跑了，留在庙上的老弱喇嘛也都换了破衣裳，提心吊胆地准备应付这场灾难。但是来的是解放军。他们并不进庙，对人挺和气。老喇嘛觉得冷待这样的好人太不像话，就把解放军同志们请到庙里吃饭。吃罢饭，解放军不顾喇嘛推辞，坚决付了钱。这时老喇嘛就把跑了的喇嘛都喊回来，又穿起好衣服跳起鬼来。
    这个地方解放了。从此，喇嘛的财产受到了保护，风俗习惯和宗教信仰也受到尊重。更要紧的是：国民党反动统治下的蒙族人民的人口和牲畜急剧下降的情况改变了，开始出现的是人畜两旺的新气象。这就使阿文史拉布和全体蒙族人民一样，深深地受到了感动。他说：“解放军和志愿军都是我们幸福生活的保卫者，我们照顾他们的家属不是应该的吗！”  杨树林（附图片）
