    The Party Educated Me and Promoted Me
    I was a transport worker pushing ash at the Shijingshan Power Plant for five years. After liberation, the Communist Party promoted me from the ash tunnel, administratively making me the deputy director of the transportation yard, and the Party members elected me as the branch secretary. If I can still do something for the people today, it is entirely the result of the Party's cultivation and education. Every time I encountered difficulties in my work, they were resolved under the Party's guidance. There are too many such facts. Here are two examples:

    Needless to say, I hadn't gone to school and couldn't recognize many characters. When I became a cadre, the first problem I encountered was writing a ten-day work plan. I was completely lost for a long time and had to discuss it with other comrades, asking those who could write to put the opinions together and hand them over to the leading cadres. The higher-ups understood my difficulty and patiently educated me to study culture and overcome difficulties. The higher-ups sent a middle school student to work in our unit. At this time, I was very satisfied, and I asked him for help with anything that needed to be written. After three months, it was time to write a work summary. I went to him, asking three times, but he was busy with other work. There was no way to avoid it, and I couldn't sleep when I got home. On the 30th, I was so anxious that I shed tears. The higher-ups still encouraged me to overcome difficulties, and enlightened me, saying: "You have been studying for a period of time, and a Communist Party member cannot always rely on others!" At this moment, I understood it, and I drilled into the small room to practice writing myself. I wrote a total of one thousand characters, not counting the typos for the time being, and drew two hundred and forty circles to replace the characters that I didn't know how to write. There were too many circles to remember, so I had to go out and ask others, and then come back and add them. It took me three days to write the summary and hand it over to the higher-ups. I thought to myself, this is embarrassing. But the higher-ups publicly praised me, saying that this summary had practical matters, analysis, and review, and was well written. At this moment, I felt both happy and enlightened. I didn't need to ask others to write summaries anymore, and I had even greater confidence in my work.

    When I was first made branch secretary, when people came to me to deal with problems, I would always say "Let's do it!" The way of doing it was very simple, doing a bunch of things in a rush, running into some snags, getting angry, but the work was still not done well. The higher-ups patiently pointed out my shortcomings, saying: This way of working is not right, and there are also problems with your thinking. Since then, I have begun to study work methods. Later, our team accepted a task. In order to take care of the workers' health, we had to change the current number of people to a three-and-a-half shift system, and take turns resting on Sundays. At this time, I heard a worker say: "Whether or not they are working for the workers depends on whether they give us four days of overtime pay per month; if they cancel the overtime pay on Sundays, we will fight them!" I knew this matter would not be easy to handle, and I firmly remembered what the Party branch taught me – "Pay attention to work methods." At that time, the director of the yard believed that the problem would not be solved if it was dragged on, and wanted to implement it by administrative order. I remembered what the leading comrades had told me: to promote work, you must use typical breakthroughs. I found a group with a better foundation, and researched with several Party members, repeatedly explaining: Resting on Sundays is for everyone's health; not working and demanding overtime pay is a violation of the principle of distribution according to work. I wanted them to take the lead in this matter. They went to discuss it with the masses in the group and raised a difficulty: we need to add one person to rotate shifts. I negotiated with the administrative side, added a person, and supported them, saying to them: "If it doesn't work, we'll go back." Everyone was in high spirits and agreed to try it out. The result was very good. After working for four days, the night shift didn't feel tired yet, so they took a big rest, and also rested for two day shifts. The workers said: "We can live two years longer working this way, and we can learn more politics, culture, and technology. We would rather not have overtime pay." In this way, the conditions for changing to the three-and-a-half shift system were ripe. We took the changed situation of this group to other groups to promote it. In this way, the entire workshop implemented the three-and-a-half shift system on a voluntary basis, making the use of labor more reasonable. From these two things, I have deeply realized that as long as you rely on the leadership, care for the masses, and overcome inferiority complex, no matter how many difficulties there are in the work, you can overcome them.

### 党教育了我，提拔了我

    党教育了我，提拔了我
    编辑同志：我是在石景山发电厂推了五年炉灰的运输工人。解放后，共产党把我从炉灰道里提拔上来，行政上让我当运输场的副主任，党员同志们选我作支部书记。如果说我今天还能给人民办些事情的话，那完全是党对我的培养和教育的结果。每一次我在工作中碰到了困难，都是在党的指示下解决了。这样的事实太多了，下面我举两个例子：
    我，不用说，没有读过书，斗大的字认不了几个。当了干部，遇到的第一个问题是写十天的工作计划。我抓瞎了半天，只得找其他的同志一块商量，让会写字的把意见凑拢凑拢，交给领导干部。上级了解了我这个困难，耐心地教育我学习文化，克服困难。上级派一个中学生到我们这个单位来工作。这时，我很满意，有写的东西都找他帮忙。过了三个月，该写工作总结了。我去找他，连找三次，他都忙着搞别的工作。这下没办法，回到家里觉也睡不着。三十号那天急得我掉下泪来。上级还是鼓励我克服困难，启发我说：“你已经学习了一个时期，共产党员不能老依赖别人啊！”这下我心眼就豁亮了，自己钻到小屋子里去练习写。共写了一千个字，错白字暂不算它，画了二百四十个圈来代替不会写的字。圈画得多了又记不住，只好出去问了别人，回来再添上。花了三天的时间，才算把总结写好，交给上级。心想，这可是见不得人啦。可是上级却当众把我表扬了一番，说这个总结有实际事，有分析，有检讨，写的不错。这一下我心里又痛快又明亮，往后写总结再也不用找别人了，搞工作信心也就更大了。
    刚让我当支部书记时，人家找我处理问题，我总是说“干吧”！干的方式很简单，忙忙乱乱地搞一顿，碰了些钉子，发了些脾气，工作还是没有做好。上级又耐心地指出我的缺点说：这种工作方法不对头，思想也有问题。从此，我开始研究工作方法。往后，我场接受了一个任务，为了照顾工友身体健康，要把现有人数改成三班半制，星期天可以轮流休息。这时我听见一个工人说：“给工人办事不办事，就是看他给不给我们每月四天的加班费；取消星期天的加班费就和他拼命！”我就知道这件事不好办，牢牢记住党总支教育我的话——“要注意工作方法。”当时场主任认为问题拖下来，不解决不好，要按行政命令来执行。我就想起领导同志曾经告诉我：推动工作要用典型突破。我就找了一个基础比较好的班，和几个党员研究，反复说明：星期天休息是为了大伙的健康；不干活要加班费是违反按劳取酬的原则的。要他们在这件事上起带头作用。他们去和组里的群众研究了一番，提出了一个困难：要添一个人才能倒班。我和行政方面商量好了，补了人，给他们撑腰，对他们说：“如果试了不合适再倒回来。”大家情绪很高，同意试试看。结果很好。干了四天，夜班还没有感到累，就来一个大歇班，还歇两天白班。工人们说：“这样干活我们可以多活两岁，可以多学点政治、文化和技术，我们宁愿不要加班费。”这样，改为三班半制条件就成熟了。我们就把这个小组改变后的情形拿到其他组去宣传。这样全车间在自觉自愿的基础上实行三班半制，使劳动力使用更合理了。从这两件事我深刻地体会到：只要依靠领导，关心群众，克服自卑心理，工作的困难再多，也能够克服它。
