China General Merchandise Company blindly orders and stockpiles large quantities of imported goods
The supply system mentality and bureaucratic work style that cause this phenomenon must be resolutely eliminated in order to lay the foundation for the implementation of economic accounting system.
The China General Merchandise Company recently inspected the purchase plans and sales of imported goods, and discovered a serious situation where, due to a lack of understanding of the actual needs of the masses and the specifications of goods, failure to calculate costs, and ignorance of the amount of inventory, goods were blindly purchased, resulting in a large backlog of goods, affecting capital turnover, and causing significant losses to national assets.

In 1951, the company blindly purchased materials, causing significant losses to the state. For example, last year, 16,027 kilograms of photographic developers, Hytol and Mitol, were purchased from abroad, enough to supply the entire country for more than ten years. However, the shelf life of the developer is only one year. If properly stored, the shelf life can be extended appropriately, but its effectiveness will be reduced. This item alone has accumulated 7.3 billion yuan in funds for a long time. The company also ordered a large number of dry battery radios from abroad. The cadres who planned the order did not understand the specifications of the goods, nor did they understand the purchasing power of farmers. They blindly believed that rural areas and the military needed this kind of radio, so they ordered 2,900 dry battery radios and 3,000 sets of spare vacuum tubes, worth 10 billion yuan. After these radios were shipped, it was discovered that because they used batteries, they were inconvenient to carry and expensive to operate, making them unsuitable for military use; and each radio sold for 3 million yuan, which farmers could not afford; urban institutions and citizens did not use this type of radio either. Therefore, these radios could not be sold and accumulated 10 billion yuan of funds for a long time. In October, the company imported more than 4,200 hunting rifles, which could not be sold at all. What is strange is that soon after, it continued to order 4,000 more from abroad. Each rifle sold for 5 to 6 million yuan, and each bullet sold for 4,000 yuan, which no one could afford. More than 30 billion yuan of funds have been accumulated for a long time.

Why did these phenomena occur? The company's leading cadres reviewed and said that after receiving the foreign exchange allocation task from the Central Ministry of Commerce, they handed over such an important import plan to the clerks in the import section. These clerks neither understood the inventory situation nor the needs of the masses. They simply made plans based on their own subjective imagination. These order plans were then submitted after being “approved” by the section chief and manager at each level. They believed that since the foreign exchange was allocated by the higher authorities, their task was to make a plan. As long as the foreign exchange quota was met, the task was completed. They did not consider whether the goods could be sold or not. On the other hand, the staff of the sales units did not understand the inventory situation, and only asked the higher authorities for fast-selling goods, but did not actively find sales channels for slow-selling goods. They never calculated the number of capital turnovers, nor did they calculate costs and profits and losses. Anyway, if there was no money, they would ask the higher authorities for it, and if they had money, they would hand it over to the higher authorities. This supply system mentality and bureaucratic work style have created a situation in which a large amount of funds is accumulated on the one hand, and there is a sense of insufficient funds on the other hand, resulting in a large amount of goods being accumulated in warehouses, causing serious losses to national wealth.

In order to change this phenomenon of blindly importing goods and accumulating goods and funds, it is necessary to mobilize the enthusiasm of employees, overcome the supply system mentality of state-owned trade cadres, implement the economic accounting system, and use the economic accounting system to manage state-owned trade in order to accelerate capital turnover, reduce commodity circulation costs, accumulate funds, ensure that materials and funds suffer as little loss as possible, and complete the tasks assigned to state-owned trade departments by the state. The China General Merchandise Company, in accordance with the regulations of the Central Ministry of Commerce, is preparing to complete the establishment of wholesale stations in the fourth quarter of this year and make preparations for the implementation of the economic accounting system. In order to draw the attention of relevant departments at all levels to this work, the company has decided to rely on all employees, promote democracy, thoroughly expose and criticize the serious losses of national wealth caused by the supply system mentality, in order to improve the ideological understanding of cadres and lay the foundation for the implementation of the economic accounting system.

    中国百货公司盲目订货积压大批进口商品
    造成这种现象的供给制思想和官僚主义作风，必须坚决肃清，以便为实行经济核算制打下基础
    中国百货公司最近检查进口商品的购货计划和销售情形，发现了由于不了解群众的实际需要和商品规格，不计算成本，不知道库存商品量，盲目购进货物，以致积压大量商品，影响资金周转，使国家资财受到重大损失的严重情况。
    该公司在一九五一年盲目购进物资，给国家造成很大的损失。例如，去年从国外购进的摄影显影剂海特尔、米特尔达一万六千零二十七公斤，足供全国十多年之用。但显影剂的有效期仅为一年。如能注意保管，有效期可适当延长，但其效能就要减低。只这一项，就长期积压了七十三亿元的资金。该公司又向国外订购了大量干电池收音机，订购货计划的干部既不了解商品规格，又不了解农民购买力，竟盲目地认为农村和部队需要这种收音机，就订购干电池收音机二千九百架及备用真空管三千套，价值一百亿元。这批收音机运到以后，才发现由于使用电池，携带不便，耗费又大，不适于部队使用；且每架售价三百万元，农民无力购买；城市机关、市民又不用这种收音机。因此，这批收音机就无法出售，长期积压一百亿元资金。十月间该公司进口猎枪四千二百多支，根本不能销售。使人奇怪的是，此后不久，竟又继续向国外订购了四千支，每支售价五、六百万元，每发子弹售价四千元，没有人买得起，三百多亿元资金，长期积压下来。
    为什么会造成这些现象呢？该公司的领导干部检讨说，他们接到中央商业部分配的外汇任务后，就把这样重要的进口计划，交给进口科内的科员去编制，这些科员既不了解库存物资情况，又不了解群众需要，仅根据自己主观的想像，把计划订了下来。这些订货计划，就这样经过处长、经理的层层“批准”，交上去了。他们认为，反正外汇是上级拨给的，我们的任务是订计划，只要凑满了外汇数额，就算完成任务了，至于货物能不能卖出去，是没有考虑到的。另一方面，销货单位的工作人员也不了解库存情况，只向上级要顺销货，但不积极给滞销货找销路。他们从不计算资金流转次数，也不计算成本和盈亏，反正没有钱就向上级要，有了钱就向上级缴。这种供给制思想和官僚主义作风，造成了一面大量积压资金，一面又感到资金不足的情况，把大量商品积压在仓库里，使国家财富受到严重损失。
    为了改变这种盲目进货，积压商品和资金的现象，必须发挥职工的积极性，克服国营贸易干部中的供给制思想，贯彻经济核算制，用经济核算制的方法来管理国营贸易以加速资金周转，减低商品流转费用，积累资金，保证物资和资金尽量少受损失，完成国家给予国营贸易部门的任务。中国百货公司遵照中央商业部的规定，准备在今年第四季度完成设置批发站的工作，做好贯彻经济核算制的准备工作。为了引起各级有关部门对这一工作的重视，该公司决定依靠全体职工，发扬民主，彻底揭发和批判由于供给制思想所造成的国家财富的严重损失，以提高干部的思想认识，给贯彻经济核算制打下基础。
