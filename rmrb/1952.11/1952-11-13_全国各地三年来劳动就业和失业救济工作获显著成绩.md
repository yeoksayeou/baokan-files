Remarkable achievements have been made in labor employment and unemployment relief work across the country in the past three years. Due to the long-term aggression of imperialism and the long-term rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, a severe unemployment phenomenon was created in Chinese society. This difficult problem left over from the old society has been preliminarily and well resolved in the short three years since the founding of New China. In the past three years, governments at all levels across the country have helped more than 2.2 million unemployed workers and unemployed intellectuals to find new employment. In the Northeast region, which was liberated earlier and has experienced faster economic construction development, the number of employees in the region has increased by 66.8 percent from 1949 to the present. After the start of labor employment work this year, the registered unemployed, semi-unemployed, and jobless people account for only 5.6 percent of the newly added employees in the Northeast region in the four years since liberation. In the Southwest region, which was liberated last, more than 270,000 people have obtained employment opportunities from 1950 to the end of September this year. This number is approximately equal to three-quarters of the total number of registered unemployed people.

In the past three years, the people's government has adopted a planned and step-by-step approach to solving the problem of labor employment. The achievements and process of this work illustrate that our country has superior objective conditions and a material foundation for gradually solving the unemployment problem under the new democratic system.

As early as after the liberation of the mainland, governments at all levels, on the one hand, adopted a policy of "taking over" all 9 million former public and educational personnel, and on the other hand, actively sought ways to provide relief to a large number of unemployed workers who could not be solved due to the temporary difficulties in the national financial economy at that time. In 1950, workers and the broad masses of people across the country donated more than 31.2 billion yuan to relieve unemployed workers in Shanghai. At the same time, the Central People's Government allocated 400 million jin of millet as an unemployment relief fund, and established special relief agencies in cities with more serious unemployment phenomena. These measures powerfully shattered the sabotage conspiracy of the US-Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. At that time, the main method of providing relief to unemployed workers was to carry out various municipal construction projects in the cities in the form of work relief. In a year and a half, cities such as Shanghai, Nanjing, Wuhan, Tianjin, and Beijing adopted this method to mobilize unemployed workers to renovate roads for a total length of 1,649 li and sort out sewers for 486 li, which not only solved the living problems of a large number of unemployed workers, but also enabled many urban construction projects to be completed rapidly. Many unemployed workers have created conditions for long-term employment through hard work in learning engineering technology, and some have even been promoted to revolutionary cadres.

With the improvement of the national financial and economic situation and the restoration and development of production and construction, since 1951, the people's government has gradually adopted a policy of focusing on retraining for the solution of the employment problem of unemployed workers. According to statistics at the end of October 1951, there were 209 retraining units in various cities across the country, with 37,400 workers participating in the training. Most of the unemployed workers who have undergone retraining have good employment conditions, and their production is very active after taking up their jobs. This retraining method is not only the correct way to solve the unemployment problem, but also an effective measure to train a large number of reserve labor forces for industrial and mining enterprises. With the start of large-scale national economic construction, the retraining method will still occupy an extremely important position in labor employment work in the future.

Since this year, a new atmosphere has emerged in labor employment work across the country. This is because the development of the national industry has gradually moved from the stage of restoring production to the stage of basic construction, thus providing more favorable conditions for solving the urban unemployment problem. As of September this year, a total of more than 70,000 construction workers have been transferred and allocated by the Northeast People's Government (excluding those in various provinces and cities). The Northeast region is also preparing to systematically fix the existing construction technicians in batches this year to reduce the phenomenon of intermittent unemployment of construction workers. The Shanghai construction sites under the East China Construction Industry Department have absorbed more than 20,000 workers this year, more than one and a half times more than in the past. At present, the unemployment and semi-unemployment phenomenon of construction workers in Shanghai has gradually improved, and the main construction technicians have basically been employed.

The people's government has also given special care to the employment problem of the vast number of unemployed intellectuals. In the East China region, the total number of unemployed intellectuals who went to major administrative regions for recruitment or were directly introduced by various provinces and cities to take up their jobs in the past three years is more than 230,000. The Shanghai Municipal People's Government Education Bureau, the Shanghai Municipal Working Committee of the New Democratic Youth League, and the Preparatory Committee of the Shanghai Municipal Democratic Youth Federation have all held various training classes in politics, culture, and business for unemployed young intellectuals in the past three years to prepare them for employment. From 1951 to the first half of 1952, Guangdong Province recruited, trained, and employed a total of more than 40,000 unemployed intellectuals and technicians, including a number of returned overseas Chinese.

In the past three years, governments at all levels have also organized production self-rescue and returning to the countryside for production with great efforts. As of the end of October 1951, there were 428 production self-rescue units across the country, resettling more than 118,000 unemployed workers. For those unemployed people in medium-sized and small cities who lack specialized production technology but have the conditions to engage in agricultural production, various places have mobilized them to return to the countryside for production on a voluntary basis. This work was carried out during the land reform movement. For more than two years, about 130,000 unemployed people have been resettled in rural areas, playing a certain backbone role in the land reform and production movement.

For a group of poor and helpless elderly, weak, disabled, vagrant children, and unemployed vagrants in society, the people's government has provided shelter, and then provided relief, education, or transformation respectively. According to incomplete statistics, the three major administrative regions of North China, Central South, and Southwest, and the four cities of Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, and Guangzhou have taken in and transformed a total of more than 218,000 unemployed or jobless people in the past three years. Due to the rapid development of national economic construction, a broad employment path has been opened up for this group of people. Therefore, when dealing with this type of problem, the people's government has been and will continue to limit simple relief work to those who have truly lost their labor force and have difficulties in life. For example, in the entire Southwest region, the issuance of relief funds accounted for only 16 percent of all processed unemployed people.

At present, the unemployment phenomenon has been gradually alleviated, but there are still some difficulties in completely solving the unemployment problem. These difficulties will be gradually overcome with the development of large-scale national economic construction. In the future, under the correct leadership of the people's government and with the active assistance of the people of the whole country, my country's historical unemployment problem will be gradually resolved in stages and batches.

### 全国各地三年来劳动就业和失业救济工作获显著成绩

    全国各地三年来劳动就业和失业救济工作获显著成绩
    全国各地三年来进行劳动就业和失业救济工作已获得显著成绩。由于帝国主义的长期侵略和国民党反动派的长期统治，在中国社会上造成了严重的失业现象，这个由旧社会遗留下来的困难问题，在新中国成立后的短短三年里，已经得到初步的良好的解决。三年来，全国各级人民政府帮助失业工人和失业知识分子重新就业的共达二百二十余万人。在解放较早、经济建设发展较快的东北区，从一九四九年到现在，全区职工人数增加了百分之六十六点八；今年劳动就业工作开始后，已登记的失业、半失业和无业人员，仅占东北区解放后四年来新增加的职工人数的百分之五点六。在解放最晚的西南区，从一九五○年到今年九月底，也有二十七万多人得到就业机会，这个数目大约相等于全部登记的失业人员总数的四分之三。
    三年来，人民政府对于劳动就业问题的解决，是采取有计划、有步骤的方针来进行的。这一工作的成就及其过程，说明了我国在新民主主义的制度下具有逐步解决失业问题的优越的客观条件和物质基础。
    早在全国大陆解放之后，各级人民政府一方面对九百万旧公教人员采取了全部“包下来”的政策，一方面对当时由于国家财政经济还暂时处于困难状况而无法解决的大批失业工人，积极设法进行救济。一九五○年，全国各地职工和广大人民曾捐款三百十二亿余元救济上海失业工人，中央人民政府同时拨出小米四亿斤作为失业工人救济基金，在失业现象较为严重的城市中建立了专门的救济机构，这些措施有力地粉碎了美蒋匪帮的破坏阴谋。当时对失业工人进行救济的主要方式是在各城市中举办以工代赈的各项市政建设工程。上海、南京、武汉、天津、北京等市在一年半时间内，采取这种方式动员失业工人翻修马路共长达一六四九里，整理下水道四八六里，不仅解决了大批失业工人的生活问题，并使许多城市建设工程得以迅速完成。不少失业工人由于努力学习工程技术，因而创造了长期就业的条件，有的还被提拔为革命干部。
    随着全国范围内财政经济情况的好转，以及生产建设的恢复和发展，从一九五一年开始，人民政府对于失业工人就业问题的解决逐渐采取了以转业训练为主的方针。据一九五一年十月底的统计：全国各城市举办转业训练的单位共有二○九个，参加训练的工人达三万七千四百人。经过转业训练的失业工人大部分都具备了良好的就业条件，在走上工作岗位后，生产非常积极。这种转业训练的方法，不仅是解决失业问题的正确道路，而且是培养工矿企业大批后备劳动力的有效措施。随着国家大规模经济建设的开始，今后转业训练的方式在劳动就业工作中仍将占着极为重要的地位。
    今年以来，在全国各地劳动就业工作中出现了一个新的气象，这便是由于国家工业的发展已由恢复生产逐渐走向基本建设的阶段，因而为解决城市失业问题提供了更有利的条件。到今年九月份为止，经过东北人民政府统一调配的建筑工人共七万多人（各省市在外），东北区并准备在今年内将现有建筑技术工人有计划地分批固定下来，以减少建筑工人的间歇失业现象。华东建筑工业部所属上海各工地今年吸收了两万多工人参加工作，比过去增加一倍半以上。目前上海市建筑工人的失业和半失业现象已逐渐好转，主要的建筑技术工人都已基本就业。
    人民政府对广大的失业知识分子的就业问题也曾给予特殊的关心。在华东区，三年来由各大行政区前往招聘或由各省市直接介绍走上工作岗位的失业知识分子总数在二十三万人以上。上海市人民政府教育局、新民主主义青年团上海市工作委员会、上海市民主青年联合会筹备会等单位，三年来都曾为失业青年知识分子举办了政治、文化、业务的各种训练班，为他们准备就业条件。广东省从一九五一年到一九五二年上半年止，经过招聘、训练、录用的失业知识分子和技术人员共有四万多人，其中并包括一部分归国华侨。
    三年来，各级人民政府还以很大力量组织了生产自救和还乡生产的工作。到一九五一年十月底止，全国共有四百二十八个生产自救的单位，安置了失业工人达十一万八千多人。各地对于那些缺乏专门生产技术而又具备着从事农业生产条件的中、小城市失业人员，都动员他们在自愿原则下还乡生产。这一工作是在土地改革运动期间进行的。两年多以来，约有十三万失业人员被安置在农村，在土地改革和生产运动中起了一定的骨干作用。
    对于社会上一批贫苦无依的老弱残废、流浪儿童和无业游民等，人民政府都予以收容，然后分别进行救济、教养或改造。根据不完全统计：华北、中南、西南三大行政区和北京、上海、天津、广州四市，三年来收容和改造的失业或无业人员共达二十一万八千多人。由于国家经济建设的飞跃发展，为这一部分人员开辟了广阔的就业道路，因此，人民政府在处理这一类问题时，过去是而且今后还将是把单纯救济工作仅仅限于对待那些比重很小的真正丧失劳动力而又生活困难的人。例如西南全区在所有经过处理的失业人员中，发放救济金的仅占百分之十六。
    目前，失业现象已日见减轻，但全部解决失业问题仍存在一些困难，这些困难是会随着国家大规模经济建设的开展而逐步被克服的。今后在人民政府的正确领导和全国人民的积极协助下，我国历史性的失业问题，将分期分批逐步获得解决。
