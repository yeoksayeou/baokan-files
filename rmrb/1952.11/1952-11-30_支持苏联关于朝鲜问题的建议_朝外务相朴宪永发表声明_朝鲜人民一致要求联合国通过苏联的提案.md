Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, November 29th: DPRK Foreign Minister Pak Hon-yong issued a statement on the 28th, supporting the proposal on the Korean question put forward by Soviet delegation head Vyshinsky in the First (Political) Committee of the UN General Assembly. The statement is as follows:

On November 10, 1952, in the meeting of the First Committee of the United Nations General Assembly discussing the Korean question, the head of the Soviet delegation, A.Y. Vyshinsky, in order to further clarify the Soviet proposal put forward on October 29, proposed the following draft resolution on the Korean question:

"The General Assembly, having considered the report of the United Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea, considers it necessary:

To establish a committee for the peaceful settlement of the Korean question, composed of directly interested parties and other countries—including countries not participating in the Korean War.

The committee so appointed shall be composed of the United States of America, the United Kingdom, France, the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, India, Burma, Switzerland, Czechoslovakia, the Democratic People's of Korea and South Korea.

To instruct the above-mentioned Committee to take immediate measures to resolve the Korean question in the spirit of unifying Korea by the Koreans themselves under the supervision of the aforementioned Committee, including measures to assist both parties in the repatriation of all prisoners of war as far as possible."

The US delegation to the Seventh Session of the United Nations General Assembly rejected such a just proposal by the Soviet Union and used all sorts of conspiracies behind the scenes in an attempt to pass its own draft resolution to continue the Korean War.

Subsequently, on November 24 this year, at the Political Committee, the head of the Soviet delegation, A.Y. Vyshinsky, proposed the following recommendation: that the warring parties in Korea immediately and completely cease fire in accordance with the draft armistice agreement already agreed upon by both parties, that is, both parties cease all military operations on land, sea, and air, and that the issue of the repatriation of all prisoners of war be handed over to the Committee for the Peaceful Settlement of the Korean Question stipulated in the Soviet proposal for resolution, and that all issues in this committee be decided by a two-thirds majority of all members.

I am authorized to make the following statement regarding this proposal by the Soviet delegation: The war launched by the American interventionists in Korea has continued for two years and five months. The armistice negotiations, which began due to the Soviet proposal, have been going on for more than a year since their commencement. The negotiation process has shown that the United States has no concern for a peaceful settlement of the Korean issue, but has been delaying the negotiations by various means, and finally used the issue of the repatriation of prisoners of war to provoke a unilateral breakdown of the negotiations.

The United States has recently intensified its savage and brutal bombing of the peaceful people of Korea. Disregarding the world's peoples' desire for peace, it is attempting to continue the state of war in Korea for its own aggressive purposes.

The Soviet Union, which bases its foreign policy on consolidating peace and friendly cooperation between the peoples of all countries, has made consistent efforts to peacefully and justly resolve the Korean question. The Soviet Union's peace policy has always been and will continue to be unanimously supported by the Korean people and all progressive humanity.

The aforementioned proposal made by the head of the Soviet delegation, A.Y. Vyshinsky, at the Political Committee on November 24 this year, once again demonstrates to the world the Soviet Union's just position in peacefully resolving the Korean question.

The Korean people, together with all peace-loving people around the world, warmly support this proposal by the Soviet delegation.

The Government of the DPRK, which has consistently strived for peace, considers this proposal to be the most just recommendation for achieving a swift end to military actions in Korea and a peaceful resolution of the Korean question, and fully supports this proposal by the Soviet delegation.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, November 28th: Korean media and people from all walks of life unanimously support the just proposal on the Korean question put forward by the Soviet delegation at the Political Committee of the UN General Assembly and firmly demand that the UN adopt the Soviet proposal.

The "Rodong Sinmun" published an editorial on the 24th entitled "Demand Adoption of the Soviet Proposal on the Korean Question," stating: The Korean people and the people of all countries in the world are concerned and are closely watching the process of the UN General Assembly discussing the Korean question. The editorial pointed out: In the course of the discussion, the revised proposal on the Korean question put forward by the Soviet delegation on November 10 is the only reasonable plan that can truly achieve a Korean armistice and a peaceful resolution of the Korean question. Therefore, there can be no other just path than to smash all the sinister plots of the US bloc and accept the proposal of the Soviet delegation. The editorial emphasized: We, the Korean people, warmly support the proposal of the Soviet delegation and firmly demand that the United Nations adopt it. We are also determined to fight to the end to thoroughly smash the US aggressors' plot to expand the war of aggression against Korea and defend the freedom and independence of our motherland.

The Soviet delegation's proposal has received widespread support in factories, institutions, and rural areas throughout Korea. A worker from a certain factory, Han Dao-yong, said: I pay close attention to the discussion of the Korean question at the UN General Assembly every day. The efforts made by the Soviet delegation at the General Assembly to peacefully resolve the Korean question and its just proposal have thoroughly exposed the deceptive arguments in Acheson's speech, and it is completely in line with the wishes of the Korean people. We must strive to realize this proposal. Kim Sheng-kui, a technician from a factory in a certain place, and Kim Ki-hwan, a staff member from a certain institution, both stated: The spirit of the Soviet delegation's proposal is in line with international law and human morality. Only such a just plan can immediately achieve a Korean armistice and achieve a peaceful resolution of the Korean question. The United Nations must pay attention to the will of the Korean people and the people of the world and adopt this proposal. The vast number of farmers in various parts of Korea also expressed warm support for the Soviet delegation's proposal, and they are determined to actively support the front lines and strike the US aggressors more severely in order to repay the efforts made by the Soviet people and all good people around the world to support the Korean people and strive for peace in Korea.

    支持苏联关于朝鲜问题的建议
    朝外务相朴宪永发表声明
    朝鲜人民一致要求联合国通过苏联的提案
    【新华社平壤二十九日电】朝鲜民主主义人民共和国外务相朴宪永于二十八日发表声明，支持苏联代表团团长维辛斯基在联合国大会第一（政治）委员会上所提出的关于朝鲜问题的建议。声明如下：
    一九五二年十一月十日，苏联代表团团长安·扬·维辛斯基在讨论朝鲜问题的联合国大会第一委员会会议上，为了更加明确十月二十九日所提出的苏联提案，对于朝鲜问题提出了如下的决议草案：
    “大会研究了朝鲜统一复兴委员会的报告，认为有必要：
    设立一个由直接有关的各方以及其他国家——其中包括没有参加朝鲜战争的国家——参加的和平解决朝鲜问题委员会。
    这个任命的委员会由美国、英国、法国、苏联、中华人民共和国、印度、缅甸、瑞士、捷克斯洛伐克、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和南朝鲜组成。
    责成上述委员会本着由朝鲜人自己在上述委员会的监督下统一朝鲜的精神，立即采取解决朝鲜问题的措施，其中包括尽量协助双方遣返全部战俘的措施。”
    出席联合国第七届大会的美国代表团拒绝苏联这样的公正的提案，而在幕后用尽一切阴谋，企图通过它自己的要继续朝鲜战争的决议草案。
    接着，在今年十一月二十四日政治委员会上，苏联代表团团长安·扬·维辛斯基提出下述建议：建议朝鲜的交战双方按照双方已经同意的停战协定草案，立即完全停火，就是说双方停止一切陆、海、空军事行动，战俘全部遣返的问题应交给苏联提案所规定的和平解决朝鲜问题委员会去解决，在这个委员会中一切问题要经全体成员三分之二多数赞成决定。
    我被授权特就苏联代表团的这个建议作如下声明：美国干涉者在朝鲜发动的战争，已经继续了两年又五个月。由于苏联的提议而开始的停战谈判，从开始到现在已有一年以上。谈判过程显示了美国毫不关心和平解决朝鲜问题，而以各种方法拖延谈判，最后为了片面破坏谈判，就利用遣返战俘问题进行挑衅。
    美国最近更加强对朝鲜和平人民的穷凶极恶的野蛮轰炸。它不顾全世界人民对和平的渴望，为了自己的侵略目的而企图继续朝鲜的战争状态。
    把巩固和平与各国人民之间的友谊合作作为自己对外政策基础的苏联，为了和平地、公正地解决朝鲜问题而作了始终一贯的努力。苏联的和平政策，在什么时候都受到并将继续受到朝鲜人民和全体进步人类的一致支持。
    苏联代表团团长安·扬·维辛斯基在今年十一月二十四日政治委员会上所提出的上述建议，又一次对全世界显示了苏联和平解决朝鲜问题的公正立场。
    朝鲜人民和全世界爱好和平人民一起热烈支持苏联代表团的这个建议。
    为实现和平而一贯努力的朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府，认为这个提案是争取迅速结束朝鲜的军事行动与和平解决朝鲜问题的最公正的建议，并完全拥护苏联代表团的这个建议。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国外务相朴宪永
    一九五二年十一月二十八日
    【新华社平壤二十八日电】朝鲜舆论界及各界人民一致拥护苏联代表团在联合国大会政治委员会上提出的关于朝鲜问题的公正提案，并坚决要求联合国通过苏联的提案。
    “劳动新闻”报在二十四日发表题为“要求通过苏联关于朝鲜问题的提案”的社论说：朝鲜人民和全世界各国人民都关心地注视着联合国大会讨论朝鲜问题的过程。社论指出：在讨论过程中，苏联代表团在十一月十日提出的关于朝鲜问题的修正后的提案，是真正能够实现朝鲜停战与和平解决朝鲜问题的唯一的合理方案。因此，除了粉碎美国集团的各种凶恶阴谋、接受苏联代表团的提案以外，是不可能有别的公正道路的。社论强调说：我们朝鲜人民热烈支持苏联代表团的提案，坚决要求联合国加以通过。我们并决心为彻底粉碎美国侵略者扩大侵朝战争的阴谋，保卫祖国的自由、独立而斗争到底。
    苏联代表团的提案在朝鲜各地的工厂、机关和农村中获得了广泛的支持。某工厂工人韩道永说：我每天都十分关心联合国大会关于朝鲜问题的讨论。苏联代表团在大会上一贯为和平解决朝鲜问题而作的努力及其公正的提案，已彻底揭露了艾奇逊演说中的欺骗论点，它和朝鲜人民的意愿是完全一致的。我们一定要为实现这个提案而奋斗。某地工厂中的技术人员金声奎和某机关职员金基焕都表示：苏联代表团提案的精神是符合国际法规和人类道德的。只有这样的公正方案才能立时实现朝鲜停战，取得朝鲜问题的和平解决。联合国必须重视朝鲜人民和全世界人民的意志，通过这个提案。朝鲜各地广大农民也对苏联代表团的提案表示热烈拥护，他们并决心积极支援前线，更沉重地打击美国侵略者，以此来答谢苏联人民和全世界所有善良人民为声援朝鲜人民，争取朝鲜和平而作的努力。
