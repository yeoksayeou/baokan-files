    The Prelude to China's Large-Scale Economic Construction: Anshan Launches Large-Scale Capital Construction
    [This newspaper's dispatch] Anshan, China's famous steel capital, has stepped out of the arduous recovery period since April of this year and entered the stage of large-scale capital construction. This is the prelude to the impending start of China's large-scale economic construction.
    Having spent just over three years completing the revival of Anshan's steel production, the working class of Anshan, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government, officially began the massive preparatory work for large-scale construction in the second half of 1951. From April of this year, they began direct preparations for this year's construction projects. To date, the allocation, organization, and training of hundreds of key management cadres, thousands of technical personnel, thousands of grassroots cadres and skilled workers, and tens of thousands of various specialized workers have been completed, as well as the purchase, ordering, and transportation of tens of thousands of tons of steel, machinery, cement, sand, gravel, hardware, and tens of thousands of other materials. At the same time, twelve departments for business and political work were established, including geology, design, planning, materials, equipment, finance, engineering management, labor and wages, organization, security, propaganda and education, and secretarial work. Six engineering companies were organized for civil construction, mechanical installation, metal structure, electrical installation, sanitary equipment installation, and furnace construction, along with five construction site management offices and fifty-six engineering teams. In addition, seven affiliated processing factories were established for concrete mixing, formwork, rebar, wood, quarrying, sand mining, and slag bricks, as well as a supply station including dozens of types of automated mechanical equipment such as excavators, cranes, graders, winches, and universal loaders. Thus, the steel capital of Anshan completed its historical task of restoring production and began large-scale capital construction.
    Anshan's capital construction projects for this year mainly include four major items. Except for residential projects, the rest are large-scale, multi-faceted, and technically complex projects. For example, one of the projects includes excavating over 100,000 cubic meters of earthwork, pouring over 48,000 cubic meters of concrete, installing more than 20,000 tons of mechanical and electrical equipment and metal structures (including building frames, columns, etc.), and laying over 87,000 meters of cable and sanitary pipes. Its technical complexity also exceeds any project in China's history. Taking Foundation Project No. 11 as an example, it requires excavating more than 7,400 cubic meters of earthwork and requires 235 tons of rebar and auxiliary parts. At the same time, the technical requirements are extremely strict and precise. For example, hundreds of anchor bolts, the largest of which weighs 1.8 tons, have a mutual tolerance of no more than three millimeters (one millimeter is smaller than a matchstick) to five millimeters. According to recent statistics, there are already six engineering companies, more than twenty engineering teams, including more than sixty types of work, working simultaneously on this one construction site.
    Because such large-scale and complex modern construction is unprecedented in China's history, the Anshan capital construction project has encountered countless difficulties in organization, leadership, material supply, and technical guidance. However, the working class of Anshan, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government, with the strong support of the people of the whole country and the great assistance of the Soviet people, has overcome all difficulties and made rapid progress in all projects. After the commencement of the various projects in Anshan, the key management cadres, technical personnel, and skilled workers all felt insufficient. The Party and the government then transferred more than 200 management cadres, more than 2,000 technical personnel and grassroots cadres (including graduates from universities and technical colleges across the country), and hundreds of skilled workers from more than 70 enterprises and various work departments across the country. Dozens of factories across the country are serving Anshan in the supply of materials and equipment. The assistance of the Soviet people is even greater. Not only are some projects entirely designed by the Soviet Union, but their latest automated equipment is also manufactured by the Soviet Union. After construction began, the Soviet people sent many experts to provide personal guidance. For example, under the guidance of Soviet experts, the Mechanical Installation Engineering Company implemented pre-installation operations, shortening the installation time of mechanical equipment by 30% to 50%. In particular, many very complex technical problems, such as measuring center lines, replacing beams, draining groundwater, and repairing waterproof layers, were quickly resolved with the guidance of Soviet experts.
    In the course of this year's construction, the Anshan working class has successively launched movements to strengthen the responsibility system, the patriotic red flag competition, and the movement to learn and promote advanced experience, thus further unleashing its enthusiasm and creativity. In the past six months or so, the workers have learned, promoted, and created more than 120 important advanced experiences. Some of these experiences play a decisive role in accelerating the progress of major projects and ensuring the quality of the projects. For example, more than 30 advanced production experiences such as foundation engineering concrete pouring assembly line operation, rebar forming assembly line operation, anchor bolt installation assembly line operation, and cable pipe installation assembly line operation have increased the work efficiency of general projects by one to five times. And the cable pipe installation assembly line operation has increased work efficiency by nearly eight times. The creation and promotion of these advanced experiences have greatly accelerated the speed of the entire project and ensured the quality of the project. For example, Projects 0190 and 0230 could only complete about 6% of the total project volume each month before August, but completed more than 19% in September, and completed more than 14% in the first twenty days of October. All of Anshan's projects this year, except for some that have special difficulties that still need to be resolved, will be completed on schedule or ahead of schedule.
    Anshan's large-scale capital construction has only just begun, and even more important and arduous tasks are still ahead, but even just looking at the projects under construction this year, its great significance has been fully demonstrated. Anshan's large-scale capital construction is not only of decisive significance for fundamentally changing China's old industrial landscape, but also can cultivate cadres, train workers, and provide experience for China's large-scale economic construction. Therefore, the start of Anshan's large-scale capital construction is a great event for the Chinese people. The people of the whole country should work hard to support Anshan and welcome the task of large-scale economic construction that is about to come!

    我国大规模经济建设的先声  鞍山展开大规模基本建设
    【本报讯】我国著名的钢都——鞍山，从今年四月份起，已跨过艰巨的恢复时期，转入大规模的基本建设阶段。这是我国大规模经济建设即将开始的先声。
    仅用三年多的时间，完成了复活鞍山钢铁生产的鞍山工人阶级，从一九五一年下半年起，就在中国共产党和人民政府的领导下，正式开始了大规模建设的巨大准备工作；今年四月份起，又开始了今年各工程施工的直接准备工作。到现在为止，已经完成了包括数百名主要管理干部、数千名技术人员、数千名基层干部和技术工人以及数万名各种专业工人的调配、组织和训练，及数以万吨计算的钢材、机械、洋灰、沙石、五金等上万种器材的购买、订制和运输。同时，成立了地质、设计、计划、材料、设备、财务、工程管理、劳动工资、组织、保卫、宣教与秘书等十二个处的业务和政治工作机构，组织了土木建筑、机械安装、金属结构、电气安装、卫生设备安装与筑炉等六个工程公司和五个工地管理处、五十六个工程队。此外，还建立了混凝土搅拌、模板、钢筋、木材、采石、采沙、矿渣砖等七个附属加工工厂和一个包括挖土机、起重机、铲平机、卷扬机、万能装卸机等数十种自动化机械设备的供应站。至此，钢都鞍山便完成了恢复生产的历史任务，开始了大规模的基本建设。
    鞍山今年的基本建设工程，主要包括四大项。除住宅工程外，其余都是规模巨大、工种繁多、技术复杂的工程。如其中一个工程的主要工程量，即包括挖掘土方十万余立方公尺，浇灌混凝土四万八千多立方公尺，机电设备安装和金属结构（包括房架、柱等）共计二万多吨，电缆管道和卫生管道达八万七千多公尺。其技术上的复杂性也超过我国历史上的任何工程。以十一号基础工程为例，就要挖掘土方七千四百多立方公尺，需要钢筋和附属零件二百三十五吨。同时，技术上的要求也极为严格、精确。如数百个地脚螺丝，其中最大的有一点八吨重，其相互间的公差，则最多不能超过三公厘（一公厘比一根火柴梗还小）到五公厘。仅在这一个工地上同时施工的单位，据最近的统计，已有六个工程公司、二十多个工程队，包括六十多个工种。
    由于这样巨大复杂的近代化的建设在我国历史上还是初次，鞍山基本建设工程，在组织上、领导上及物资供应、技术指导上，都曾遇到无数的困难。但是鞍山工人阶级在中国共产党与人民政府的领导、在全国人民的大力支援和苏联人民的巨大帮助下，战胜了一切困难，并使所有工程获得了迅速的进展。鞍山各项工程在施工以后，主要管理干部、技术人员、技术工人都感不足。党与政府便从全国七十余个企业单位与各种工作部门，先后给它调配了管理干部二百余名，技术人员及基层干部包括全国各大学、专科学校毕业学生在内，共计二千余名，技术工人数百名。在物资与设备的供应上，全国有数十个工厂都在为鞍山服务。苏联人民的帮助更是巨大。某些工程不仅全是苏联设计的，其最新式的自动化的设备，也都是苏联承制的，在施工以后，苏联人民更派来许多专家亲自指导。如机械安装工程公司，在苏联专家的指导下，实行了预安装作业，使机械设备安装的时间，缩短了百分之三十到五十。特别是许多十分复杂的技术问题，如测量中心线、托梁换柱、排地下水、修防水层等，由于苏联专家的指导，也都很迅速地获得了解决。
    鞍山工人阶级，在今年的施工过程中，先后开展了加强责任制运动、爱国红旗竞赛，以及学习和推广先进经验运动，因而更加发挥了积极性和创造性。半年多以来，仅工人群众学习、推广及创造的重要先进经验，就有一百二十多种。其中有的经验，在加速重大工程的进度与保证工程的质量上具有决定性的作用。例如基础工程浇灌混凝土流水作业、钢筋成形流水作业、地脚螺丝安装流水作业、电缆管道安装流水作业等三十多种先进生产经验，使一般工程的工作效率，提高了一倍至五倍。而电缆管道安装流水作业，更提高工作效率将近八倍。这些先进经验的创造与推广，大大地加速了整个工程的速度，保证了工程的质量。如○一九○与○二三○两个工程，在八月份以前，每月只能完成工程总量的百分之六左右，但九月份便完成了百分之十九以上，而在十月份的头二十天当中，就完成了百分之十四以上。鞍山今年的全部工程，除某些具有特殊困难，尚须设法解决外，其他工程都将按期或提前完成。
    鞍山大规模的基本建设才开始，更重大的艰巨的任务还在后面，但仅就今年施工的工程来看，已经充分地显示出了它的伟大意义。鞍山大规模的基本建设，不仅对于从根本上改变我国旧的工业面貌具有决定性的意义，而且可以为我国大规模的经济建设培养干部、训练工人和提供经验。因此鞍山大规模的基本建设的开始，是我国人民的一件大喜事。全国人民都应该努力支援鞍山，迎接即将到来的全国大规模经济建设的任务！
