Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 8th: The Central Committee of the Korean Fatherland United Democratic Front issued a letter to the people of the world on the 4th, denouncing the American aggressors' increasingly frenzied and barbaric atrocities of indiscriminately bombing peaceful towns and villages in the rear of Korea after the suspension of the Korean armistice negotiations, and calling on the people of the world to stop them. The letter to the people of the world pointed out: After deliberately delaying the Korean armistice negotiations for more than fifteen months, the American aggressors brazenly and unreasonably suspended the armistice negotiations on October 8. After the armed aggressors suspended the armistice negotiations, they tried every possible means to frantically expand the aggression. Under the guise of the United Nations flag, the American bandits are constantly creating new atrocities on our territory. Recently, they have become even more frantic in indiscriminately bombing our towns and villages, and shelling coastal areas with naval guns. In particular, the US military command uses the brutal tactic of nighttime bombing of residential areas, mobilizing B-29 heavy bombers based at Japanese airfields to carry out indiscriminate bombing.

The letter to the people of the world listed the facts of the American aerial bandits' continuous indiscriminate bombing of peaceful towns and villages in the rear of Korea from October 8 to October 29, pointing out: During this period, the US Air Force mobilized more than 3,000 bombers and fighters to conduct seventeen nighttime bombings and thirteen day and night bombings of Pyongyang and its surrounding areas. During the same period, American aerial bandits carried out more than 5,000 air raids on towns and villages in Hwanghae Province, and extensively bombed county and township seats and coastal areas in Gangwon Province, South Hamgyong Province, North Hamgyong Province, and Jagang Province, as well as rural areas, schools, temples, civilian houses, hospitals, nurseries, and orphanages in Gaecheon, Daedong, and Seongcheon in South Pyongan Province, and Cheolsan and Uiju in North Pyongan Province. The letter to the people of the world pointed out: The American aggressors are attempting to threaten and intimidate our freedom-loving people, but the enemy's extremely vicious and arrogant attempt is doomed to failure. The heroic struggle of the Korean people, which has now entered its third year, clearly shows the world that no matter how the aggressors struggle, no matter what methods and means they use, the aggressors have not been able to conquer and will never be able to conquer the Korean people or any other people who bravely defend their rights, freedom, and national independence. Our Korean people have boundless resentment and hatred for the bloodthirsty American and British armed aggressors and their lackeys. Our people's will to fight to defeat foreign aggressors is as firm as iron and stone. Our people's determination to save the Korean nation from the American aggressors' bestial atrocities and to transform our country into a democratic, unified, and independent nation is unwavering. No atrocities of the aggressors have ever and will ever stop us from achieving this sacred and lofty goal.

The letter to the people of the world concluded: The Korean Fatherland United Democratic Front resolutely opposes and protests against the new brutal crimes of the American aggressors, and calls on all kind-hearted people around the world to jointly denounce and condemn the unprecedented atrocities of the American bandits. The Korean people are convinced that the peace-loving people of the world will more forcefully stop American imperialism's aggression against Korea and demand the establishment of peace in the Far East.

    【新华社平壤八日电】朝鲜祖国统一民主主义战线中央委员会在四日发表告世界人民书，斥责美国侵略者在中止朝鲜停战谈判后变本加厉地疯狂轰炸朝鲜后方和平城乡的野蛮暴行，呼吁全世界人民加以制止。告世界人民书指出：美国侵略者在蓄意把朝鲜停战谈判拖延了十五个多月之后，在十月八日蛮横无理地中断了停战谈判。武装侵略者们在中断了停战谈判以后，千方百计地疯狂地企图扩大侵略，美国强盗在联合国旗帜的掩盖下，在我们国土上不断地制造着新的暴行，最近，它更加疯狂地滥炸我们的城乡，并以舰炮轰击海岸地带，尤其是美军司令部使用残暴的夜间轰炸居民区的战术，动员以日本机场为基地的B—二十九型重轰炸机肆行滥炸。
    告世界人民书列举了从十月八日到十月二十九日的期间，美国空中强盗连续狂轰滥炸朝鲜后方和平城乡的事实，指出：在这个期间，美国空军动员了三千架以上的轰炸机和战斗机，对平壤市及其周围地区进行了十七次夜间轰炸和十三次昼夜轰炸。在同一期间，美国空中强盗对黄海道的城乡进行了五千多次空袭，并广泛地轰炸了江原道、咸镜南道、咸镜北道、慈江道各郡面所在地及海岸地带，以及平安南道的价川、大同、成川、平安北道的铁山、义州等地的农村、学校、寺院、民房、医院、托儿所、孤儿院等。告世界人民书指出：美国侵略者妄图借此威胁和恫吓我们爱好自由的人民，但是，敌人这种穷凶极恶的狂妄企图，是注定要失败的。业已进入第三年的朝鲜人民的英雄斗争，向全世界明白地显示了不管侵略者怎样挣扎，不管它们使用什么方法和手段，侵略者并没有能征服而且将永远不能征服勇敢地维护着自己的权利、自由和民族独立的朝鲜人民或其他任何人民。我们朝鲜人民对于嗜血成性的美英武装侵略者及其走狗们的愤恨和憎恶是无限的。我们人民为击败外来侵略者而斗争的意志是铁石一般的。我们人民为从美国侵略者的野兽暴行中挽救朝鲜民族、为把我们国家变成民主统一独立的国家而斗争的决心是坚定不移的。侵略者的任何暴行从来而且永远不能阻挡我们达到这种神圣而崇高的目的。
    告世界人民书最后说：朝鲜祖国统一民主主义战线坚决反对和抗议美国侵略者的新的残暴罪行，并呼吁全世界善良的人民一致声讨和谴责美国强盗的史无前例的暴行。朝鲜人民确信全世界爱好和平的人民一定会更加有力地制止美帝国主义对朝鲜的侵略，并要求建立远东的和平。
