Xinhua News Agency, 4th. With the growing friendship between the Chinese people and the Soviet Union, the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association has developed into the largest mass organization in the country. Over the past three years, it has greatly promoted friendship and cooperation between China and the Soviet Union. The Sino-Soviet Friendship Association was established in 1949 at the founding of the People's Republic of China. It is a people's organization dedicated to enhancing the friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people. In its early days, the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association conducted several large-scale propaganda campaigns to promote the current international situation and the Sino-Soviet alliance, systematically introducing the history of the Soviet Union and Sino-Soviet friendship, enhancing the understanding of the Soviet Union among the broad masses of people, and eliminating the lingering influence of various deceptive propaganda from the enemy. Through various efforts, the organization of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association has greatly developed. General branches and branches have been established in all major administrative regions, provinces, cities, and counties throughout the country; to date, more than 119,900 grassroots organizations—branches—have been established in most factories, government agencies, and schools across the country. The members of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association include workers, peasants, revolutionary soldiers, students, industrialists, and businessmen from all strata, all ethnic groups, and all different beliefs, totaling 38.9 million members, with workers and peasants accounting for the vast majority.

    Under the propaganda and education of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, a vast number of members participated in the struggle for peace. Gao Yuquan and Zhang Yangshi, female members in Beijing in their fifties, mobilized 8,234 people to participate in the signature campaign to defend world peace within seven days. In the movement to Resist America and Aid Korea, many members volunteered to go to Korea to participate in the war against the American aggressors and achieved great victories; members in the country also actively adopted various methods to support the front lines. Yang Hou'an, a member of the Beijing Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, responded to the call of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association headquarters to donate "Sino-Soviet Friendship" aircraft by selling precious cultural relics treasured at home for generations, donating all of the proceeds, more than 42 million yuan.

    Over the past three years, the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association has used various propaganda tools to vigorously introduce the achievements of Soviet socialist and communist construction, inspiring the broad masses of people to learn from the Soviet Union. The "Sino-Soviet Friendship Newspaper" of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association headquarters, which was published not long ago, has been distributed more than 200,000 copies and is deeply loved by readers. Seventy-four kinds of periodicals are published regularly by the Sino-Soviet Friendship Associations across the country, and more than 580 kinds of books and member readers have also been published. In addition to written propaganda, various popular methods such as film screenings, picture exhibitions, and report meetings are used for propaganda. The Sino-Soviet Friendship Associations across the country have more than 200 film projection teams and more than 2,500 slide projection teams, which regularly go deep into remote villages, mountainous areas, and grasslands to show Soviet films and slides to millions of working people. In many places, farmers hearing the news of Soviet films being screened would drive carts from dozens or hundreds of miles away three or four days in advance to wait at the screening location. Propaganda vehicles of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Associations across the country also often set out to promote. According to incomplete statistics, by the end of last year, the ten propaganda vehicles sent to our country by the Soviet Foreign Cultural Association alone had traveled more than 200,000 miles and met with the people of more than 1,000 counties and cities. Sino-Soviet Friendship Association branches across the country have held more than 10,000 long-term or touring picture exhibitions, and held many regular or irregular lectures, seminars, or radio lectures on the topic of learning from the Soviet Union. In addition, in order to meet the needs of the broad masses of people learning Russian, more than 30 Sino-Soviet Friendship Association branches across the country have held Russian evening schools or Russian tutoring classes, and many regions have also created Russian language broadcast lectures. In Beijing alone, more than 20,000 people participated in the Russian language broadcast lectures.

    In order to promote national economic construction, over the past three years, the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association has been committed to introducing and promoting advanced Soviet production experiences. The Tangshan City Sino-Soviet Friendship Association branch in Hebei Province actively supported Li Shan, a member of the city's machinery factory, in experimenting with the Soviet "double-handed electric welding method." The Tangshan City branch sent special personnel to the factory to encourage and provide concrete assistance, and organized members from units such as Kailuan Coal Mine and excellent welders to visit, and then held a performance conference, helping many workers quickly learn this advanced working method. The Sino-Soviet Friendship Association branch of the Jiamusi City Vehicle Factory in Northeast China took the initiative to promote the learning of the Kovalev working method together with the trade union and administrative departments, which increased the factory's production efficiency by 45 times. In some farms in various places, the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association organizations are assisting agricultural technicians in learning advanced Soviet experience.

    Under the auspices and assistance of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, the people of China and the Soviet Union have had extensive contact, enhancing the friendship between the two peoples. Over the past three years, China and the Soviet Union have sent delegations to visit or participate in festival celebrations several times; the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association headquarters has invited seven Soviet scholars, including Yudin and Baudrev, to give lectures in our country, and has continuously sent workers, peasants, and cultural and educational workers to study in the Soviet Union. At the same time, the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association has established close ties with 64 cultural organizations in the Soviet Union and various new democratic countries, and has received a large number of valuable gifts from the Soviet Foreign Cultural Association, and sent books, pictures, musical recordings, etc. about the revolutionary struggle, economic construction, and culture and art of New China to the Soviet Union. In order to further enhance the mutual understanding and friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union, the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association launched a Sino-Soviet friendship correspondence movement, and people from all walks of life wrote letters to Marshal Stalin, the Soviet Red Army, the Soviet working people, and the Soviet cultural, artistic, and scientific circles to pay their respects, and attached various gifts. In 1951, people across the country collectively or individually wrote more than 19,000 letters to the Soviet people, sincerely expressing the Chinese people's infinite love for the Soviet Union and their firm desire to learn from the Soviet Union.

    中苏友协三年来成就巨大
    会员已达三千多万成为全国最大群众团体
    通过各种活动大大推进了中苏友好与合作
    【新华社四日讯】随着中国人民对苏联友谊的日益增长，中苏友好协会已发展为全国最大的群众团体。三年来它大大推进了中苏两国的友好和合作。中苏友协成立于一九四九年中华人民共和国开国的时候。它是以增进中苏人民友好为宗旨的人民团体。在成立初期，中苏友协曾经连续进行了几次大规模的宣传活动，宣传当前国际形势和中苏友好同盟，有系统地介绍了苏联和中苏友好的历史，提高了广大人民群众对苏联的认识，扫除了敌人的各种欺骗宣传所残留的影响。通过各种工作，中苏友协的组织得到很大的发展。全国各大行政区、省、市、县都建立了总分会及分会的组织；到目前为止，全国大部分的工厂、机关、学校已建立了十一万九千九百多个基层组织——支会。中苏友协的会员包括工人、农民、革命军人、学生、工商业者等各阶层各民族各种不同信仰的人，共三千八百九十万个会员，其中工人、农民占最大多数。
    在中苏友协的宣传和教育下，广大会员都参加了争取和平的斗争，北京市五十多岁的女会员高玉泉、张杨氏，在保卫世界和平的签名运动中，七天内曾发动了八千二百三十四人参加签名。在抗美援朝运动中，许多会员志愿赴朝参加了抗击美国侵略军的战争，取得了伟大的胜利；在国内的会员们也积极地采用各种办法支援着前线。北京市中苏友协会员杨厚安，响应中苏友协总会关于捐献“中苏友好”号飞机的号召，曾义卖家中珍藏的历代名贵文物，将所得四千二百多万元全部捐出。
    中苏友协三年来曾通过各种不同的宣传工具，大力介绍了苏联社会主义和共产主义建设的成就，鼓舞了广大人民向苏联学习的热情。不久前出版的中苏友协总会的“中苏友好报”已发行二十万份以上，深受读者的喜爱。全国各地中苏友协出版的定期刊物有七十四种，还出版了五百八十多种书籍和会员读本。除了文字宣传外，各地还采用了放映电影、图片展览、报告会等群众喜闻乐见的方式，进行宣传。各地中苏友协共有二百多个电影放映队和二千五百多个幻灯队，经常深入偏僻的乡村、山区和草原，向千百万劳动人民放映苏联电影和幻灯。许多地方的农民听到放映苏联影片的消息，三、四天以前就从几十里、几百里以外赶着大车到放映地点等候。各地中苏友协的宣传车也经常出动宣传。据不完全统计：到去年底为止，仅苏联对外文化协会送给我国的十辆宣传车，就跑了二十多万里路程，和一千多个县、市的人民见了面。全国各地的中苏友协分会曾进行了一万多次长期或巡回的图片展览，举办许多以学习苏联为专题的定期、不定期的讲演、座谈或广播讲座。此外，为了满足广大人民学习俄文的要求，全国有三十多个中苏友协分会举办了俄文夜校或俄文补习班，许多地区还创办了俄语广播讲授。仅北京市所办的俄语广播讲座，参加学习的就有二万多人。
    为了推动全国的经济建设，三年来，中苏友协致力于介绍和推广苏联先进生产经验的工作。河北省唐山市中苏友协分会积极支持该市机器厂会员李山试验苏联“双手电焊法”，唐山市分会曾派专人下厂进行鼓励和具体协助，并组织开滦煤矿等单位的会员及优秀的电焊工人参观，然后举行表演大会，帮助很多工人迅速学会了这个先进工作法。东北佳木斯市车辆工厂的中苏友协支会，主动和工会、行政方面一起推动郭瓦廖夫工作法的学习，使该厂的生产效率提高四十五倍。在各地某些农场里，中苏友协组织正在协助农业技术人员学习苏联的先进经验。
    在中苏友协的主持和帮助下，中苏两国人民有了广泛的接触，增进了两国人民的友谊。三年来，中苏两国曾数次互派代表团进行访问或参加节日的观礼；中苏友协总会曾邀请苏联学者尤金、包德列夫等七人来我国讲学，并不断派遣工人、农民和文化教育工作者到苏联学习。同时，中苏友协和苏联及各新民主主义国家的六十四个文化团体建立了密切的联系，曾收到苏联对外文化协会赠送的大批珍贵礼品，并将有关新中国的革命斗争、经济建设和文化艺术的书刊、图片、音乐唱片等寄赠苏联。为了进一步增进中苏两国人民的相互了解和友谊，中苏友协曾发起了中苏友好通信运动，各阶层人民纷纷写信向斯大林大元帅、苏联红军、苏联劳动人民以及苏联文化艺术科学界致敬，并附赠各种礼物。一九五一年全国各地人民集体或个人写给苏联人民的信件共一万九千多封，信内由衷地表达了中国人民对苏联的无限热爱和坚决向苏联学习的愿望。
