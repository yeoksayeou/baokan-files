Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 4th -- The continuous bloody massacres of Korean People's Army and Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war by the United Nations forces during the past ten months make it very clear to us that Acheson is playing a completely vicious and unprecedented deceptive trick at the United Nations General Assembly. The outrageous lie that many prisoners of war are unwilling to return home has been completely exposed by the incident of U.S. prisoner-of-war camp commander Dodd being detained by prisoners of war. The whole world knows that the U.S. side is secretly carrying out terror, atrocities, and bloody massacres under the pretext of "voluntary repatriation." However, Acheson forced the United Nations General Assembly to support this exposed deception with the U.S. proposal stained with blood.

Observers can see very clearly that the U.S. negotiating representatives are deliberately using the detention of prisoners of war as a magic weapon to obstruct the Korean armistice. At the beginning of the negotiations in July last year, the U.S. negotiating representative, Joy, intended to put the prisoner-of-war issue on the first agenda item in order to bring the negotiations to a standstill at the initial stage. However, he was later forced to put the issues directly related to the armistice ahead on the agenda and put this issue on the fourth agenda item. The trick the U.S. side is now playing is the last card the U.S. is using to obstruct the Korean armistice.

The U.S. government's vicious trick of so-called prisoners of war not wanting to return home and not being able to be forcibly repatriated relies on two magic weapons: First, using a curtain of force and terror to prevent news about the prisoners of war from spreading. Second, using Goebbels-style outrageous lies to repeatedly harp on the fallacy of so-called "prisoners of war not wanting to return home" and prisoners of war "not being forcibly repatriated."

Since the armistice negotiations began, Washington, in order to facilitate the spread of the nonsense of so-called "voluntary repatriation," has imposed a ten-month news blockade on bloody massacres of prisoners of war. During this period, news of the massacre of prisoners of war was only revealed twice, in February and March. In April, in order to create the so-called "fait accompli" of "prisoners of war strongly refusing repatriation," the United Nations forces forcibly escorted tens of thousands of prisoners of war from Geoje Island to the Korean mainland, but did not reveal any news.

In May, Clark was forced to publish the four demands raised by the prisoners of war who detained Dodd, opposing forced "screening" and opposing the rearming of prisoners of war to serve as cannon fodder, which broke the blockade of news about the prisoners of war. The U.S. side killed and wounded more than sixty prisoners of war on April 10, and the news was released after forty-three days of suppression. From this, it can be definitely seen that the U.S. side murdered many prisoners of war during the forced "screening" and forced relocation of prisoners.

The U.S. military's force and terror can no longer keep the prisoners of war who demand repatriation silent. The butcher Bonner had to rely on open violence and bloodshed to carry out forced "screening." The confession of U.S. prisoner-of-war camp commander Colson made the world know about the bloodshed and atrocities that occurred during the forced "screening." After Colson was removed from his post, Bonner made the world see in May and June that he used U.S. flame-throwing tanks and machine guns to massacre more than 340 prisoners of war to carry out forced "screening."

The reason why Washington's conspiracy to detain prisoners of war failed is that they underestimated the patriotic courage of the prisoners of war, who faced the fate of permanently wandering abroad, unable to return home, and finally dying at the hands of their mortal enemies, Syngman Rhee and Chiang Kai-shek. The prisoners of war's resistance to forced detention was so strong, and the increasingly fierce atrocities of the U.S. invading forces against the prisoners of war could not be completely blocked, that the U.S. command had to issue only brief statements about the incidents to cover up the truth of the large-scale massacres. But no matter how much they try to cover it up, the world still knows that the root cause of the bloody massacres is that the U.S. military used force to suppress prisoners of war who refused "screening" and refused to be forcibly detained.

Witnesses who escaped from U.S. prisoner-of-war camps said that the main point of "voluntary repatriation" was to threaten the prisoners of war, so that they would betray their motherland, so that they would not dare to go back. After a large number of Kuomintang "instructors" came to Geoje Island from Taiwan in September last year, they forced the prisoners of war to tattoo shameful slogans on their bodies and participate in "anti-communist organizations." They forced the prisoners of war to sign blood oaths and join the Kuomintang army in Taiwan. Kuomintang instructors forced the prisoners of war to raise the Kuomintang flag during the Kuomintang National Day in October last year. When the prisoners of war refused, more than twenty prisoners of war were killed and wounded. The last trick of this "voluntary repatriation" was to post posters with a picture of a prisoner of war looking at his tattooed arm, with the threatening title: "What will happen to you if you go back." But all these methods were ineffective, so the U.S. military had to use machine guns to kill and wound 165 so-called "cooperative anti-communist" Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war on Jeju Island when they celebrated the third anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China on October 1.

It is clear that the prisoners of war's will to return home can never be suppressed, and Washington's outrageous lies have gone bankrupt. No matter how many lies Acheson tells, he can never cover up the firm and just call of tens of thousands of prisoners of war who demand to be repatriated home and live a peaceful life.

### 美方不断屠杀我方被俘人员的血腥罪行  证明艾奇逊在联大玩弄的是彻底的骗局

    美方不断屠杀我方被俘人员的血腥罪行
    证明艾奇逊在联大玩弄的是彻底的骗局
    【新华社开城四日电】今年十个月中，联合国军对于朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军战俘一直在不断进行血腥的屠杀，这使我们非常明显地看出，艾奇逊在联合国大会上所玩弄的完全是恶毒的空前未有的欺骗把戏。所谓许多战俘不愿意回家的漫天大谎，在美国俘虏营长官杜德被战俘扣留的事件中已经被完全揭穿，全世界都晓得了美方在“自愿遣返”的藉口下暗中是在实行恐怖、暴行和血腥的屠杀。但是艾奇逊还用染满鲜血的美国的提案强迫联合国大会支持这一已被揭穿的骗局。
    观察家们都看得非常明白：美国谈判代表蓄意把扣留战俘当作阻挠朝鲜停战的法宝。在去年七月谈判刚开始的时候，美国的谈判代表乔埃就打算把战俘问题列在第一项议程上，以便在最初阶段就使谈判陷于僵局，但是后来他被迫把直接有关停战的问题放在议程前面，把这个问题列入第四项议程。现在美方玩弄的把戏，是美国阻挠朝鲜停战的最后的一张牌了。
    美国政府所玩的所谓战俘不愿意回家以及不能用武力遣返的恶毒的把戏，依靠着两件法宝：第一、用武力与恐怖的铁幕，使得有关战俘的消息无从外传。第二、利用戈培尔式的漫天大谎的手段，一再重弹所谓“战俘不愿回家”、战俘“不得强迫遣返”的谰调。
    自从停战谈判开始以后，华盛顿为了便于散布所谓“自愿遣返”的胡说，对血腥的屠杀战俘事件实行了十个月之久的新闻封锁，在这一段时期，仅在二月间与三月间透露过两次屠杀战俘的消息。在四月间，联军为了制造所谓“战俘极力拒绝遣返”的“既成事实”，用武力把成千成万的战俘从巨济岛押送到朝鲜大陆上，但是没有透露一点消息。
    到五月间，克拉克被迫发表了扣留杜德的战俘所提的反对强迫“甄别”和反对重新武装战俘充当炮灰的四项要求，这才打破了对战俘消息的封锁。四月十日美方打死打伤了六十多个战俘，这消息经过了四十三天的扣压以后才发表。从这里面可以肯定地看出：美方在强迫“甄别”与强迫迁移俘虏中间曾经谋害过许多战俘的性命。
    美军的武力和恐怖已不再能使要求遣返的战俘保持缄默，屠夫波纳不得不凭借公开的暴行和流血来实行强迫“甄别”，美国战俘营长官柯尔生的供认，使全世界知道在进行强迫“甄别”时所发生的流血和暴行，在柯尔生被撤职后，波纳在五月和六月使全世界都看到，他用美国的火焰喷射坦克和机枪屠杀了三百四十多个战俘来实行强迫“甄别”。
    华盛顿扣留战俘阴谋之所以失败，就在于他们低估了战俘们的爱国勇气，这些战俘们面临这样的命运：永久流落在外，不能回家，最后死在他们的死敌李承晚和蒋介石的手里。战俘们对强迫扣留的反抗是如此强烈，而美国侵略军对战俘愈来愈凶的暴行又无法完全封锁住，以致美国司令部不得不只发表事件的简短声明，以掩饰大规模屠杀的真相。但无论如何掩饰，全世界还是知道血腥屠杀的根本原因，就是美国军队使用武力来镇压拒绝“甄别”拒绝被强迫扣留的战俘。
    从美国战俘营逃出来的见证人说，“自愿遣返”的主要点，就在于威胁战俘们，要他们背叛他们的祖国，这样他们就不敢再回去。在去年九月大批国民党“教官”由台湾来到巨济岛以后，他们就强迫战俘们把可耻的口号刺在身上并参加“反共组织”。他们迫着战俘们签署血书，要战俘们参加在台湾的国民党军队。国民党教官强迫战俘们在去年十月国民党国庆节时升起国民党旗帜，当战俘们拒绝时，就有二十多个战俘被打死打伤。这种“自愿遣返”的最后一个花样，就是张贴一些招贴画，画着一个战俘看着他的刺了字的手臂，画上的威胁性的标题是：“如果你回去，将遭遇些什么事情”。但是所有这一切办法都无效，于是美国军队不得不在济州岛用机枪打死打伤了一百六十五名所谓“合作反共”的中国人民志愿军战俘，当他们在十月一日庆祝中华人民共和国成立三周年的时候。
    很清楚，战俘们要求回家的意志决不是镇压得住的，华盛顿的漫天大谎已经破产了。随便艾奇逊撒多少谎，决不能掩盖住成千成万战俘要求遣返回家过和平生活的坚决的正义的呼声。
