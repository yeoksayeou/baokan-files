Xinhua News Agency, November 22nd:
Eisenhower, the newly elected next President of the United States, has expressed support for the Truman administration's position of insisting on forcibly detaining prisoners of war from the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers in the Korean armistice negotiations, thereby interrupting the negotiations. Wiley, the U.S. representative to the United Nations and Republican Senator, announced on the 19th that he had consulted Eisenhower on the issue of repatriating prisoners of war. Eisenhower "expressed complete support for the principles of the United Nations, and repeatedly emphasized his agreement with the principle of not forcibly repatriating communist prisoners of war." Wiley added, "General Eisenhower has never held a different opinion from the delegation attending the United Nations."

On the eve of the election, Eisenhower repeatedly stated that if elected, he would quickly end the Korean War, thereby gaining a large number of votes. After being elected, Eisenhower, fearing the exposure of his shameless deception of voters, had been avoiding expressing his stance. However, due to the difficult situation of the United States in the United Nations, Eisenhower finally had to reveal his true colors, showing that he and Truman were birds of a feather. This fact shows that Eisenhower's so-called "ending the Korean War" is by no means the pursuit of peace in Korea that ordinary American voters hope for, but rather the continued use of so-called "military pressure." After Wiley announced Eisenhower's attitude, Truman specifically issued a statement on the 20th, expressing "great pleasure" that Eisenhower had finally expressed support for the Truman administration's absurd claim of insisting on delaying the war on the issue of prisoners of war.

Xinhua News Agency, November 22nd: New York dispatch: The American Republican Party, which won the U.S. presidential election on November 4th, is expressing through some of its spokesmen that the Republican Party opposes seeking a peaceful resolution to the Korean issue and advocates strengthening combat efforts.

The November 17th issue of "Newsweek" published an interview with Representative Martin of Massachusetts, the Republican leader in the House of Representatives and one of Eisenhower's senior strategists, by the magazine's reporter. In this interview, Martin advocated adopting a "more combative policy" on the Korean issue. He said that "only strength" can solve the problem, and "any Korean armistice agreement is meaningless." He believes that it is necessary to "strengthen the anti-communist forces in Asia." Among the methods he listed included using the Kuomintang army from Taiwan in Korea, driving more Syngman Rhee soldiers to the front lines to serve as cannon fodder, and "strengthening the Japanese army to prevent aggression."

Another important figure in the Republican Party, Senator Knowland of California, also made similar claims. In a speech to the American Petroleum Institute on the 13th, he advocated taking new military actions to break the Korean "stalemate." In addition to using the Kuomintang army from Taiwan and the Syngman Rhee army, he also advocated pressuring various puppet states to send more troops to fight in Korea and using naval blockades against the Chinese mainland.

    艾森豪威尔“结束朝鲜战争”的骗局已拆穿
    他公然表示支持杜鲁门扣留战俘拖延战争的荒谬主张
    【新华社二十二日讯】美国新当选的下一任总统艾森豪威尔已表示支持杜鲁门政府在朝鲜停战谈判中坚持强迫扣留朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军战俘从而中断谈判的立场。美国出席联合国代表、共和党参议员维利十九日宣布他曾就遣返战俘问题向艾森豪威尔征询意见。艾森豪威尔“表示完全拥护联合国的原则，同时还反复地强调他同意不强迫遣返共产党战俘的原则”。维利并补充说：“艾森豪威尔将军自来就没有抱和出席联合国代表团不同的意见。”
    艾森豪威尔在大选前夕曾口口声声说，如果他当选就要迅速结束朝鲜战争，借此骗得大量选票。当选以后，艾森豪威尔怕泄露他玩弄选民的这一无耻骗局，一直避不表明态度。但是因为美国在联合国处境的困难，艾森豪威尔终于不得不露出他的狐狸尾巴，表明自己和杜鲁门原是一丘之貉。这一事实表明：艾森豪威尔所说的“结束朝鲜战争”，绝不是美国普通选民所希望的在朝鲜觅致和平，而是继续使用所谓“军事压力”。在维利宣布了艾森豪威尔的态度之后，杜鲁门已在二十日特地发表声明，对于艾森豪威尔终于表明了支持杜鲁门政府在战俘问题上坚持拖延战争的荒谬主张，表示“十分高兴”。
    【新华社二十二日讯】纽约消息：在美国十一月四日总统选举中获胜的美国共和党正通过它的一些发言人表示，共和党反对在朝鲜问题上觅致和平解决的途径而主张加强作战努力。
    十一月十七日“新闻周刊”登载众议院共和党领袖、艾森豪威尔的高级策士之一马萨诸塞州众议员马丁对该刊记者的谈话。在这篇谈话中，马丁主张在朝鲜问题上采取“更具战斗性的政策”。他说，“只有力量”能解决问题，“任何朝鲜停战协议都是没有意义的”。他认为必须“在亚洲加强反对共产党的军队”。在他列举的办法中，包括在朝鲜使用台湾国民党军队，驱使更多李承晚士兵到前线充当炮灰以及“加强日本军队来阻止侵略”。
    共和党另一重要人物、加利福尼亚州参议员诺兰也发表了类似的主张。他在十三日向美国石油学会发表的演说中主张采取新的军事行动来打开朝鲜的
    “僵局”。除了使用台湾国民党军队和李承晚军队，他还主张压迫各仆从国家出更多兵力到朝鲜作战以及用海军封锁中国大陆等。
