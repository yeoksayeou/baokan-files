Xinhua News Agency, November 13th: To better learn from the advanced experiences of the Soviet film industry in order to develop our country's film industry, the Film Bureau of the Central People's Government specially invited the entire delegation of Soviet film artists to hold eight symposiums with Chinese film and drama workers on the 12th. More than 200 film and drama workers participated in the symposiums, which lasted from four to eight hours. At the symposiums, the Soviet friends, with great enthusiasm, comprehensively and systematically introduced the specific experiences of Soviet film work to our film workers. This symposium provided Chinese film workers with many rich and valuable gains, which will undoubtedly greatly promote our country's film work.

    Feodorov, a member of the Board of Directors of the Soviet Film Administration and Director of the Scientific and Educational Film Bureau, and Wang Lanxi, Deputy Director of the Film Bureau of the Central People's Government of China, as well as other key figures in film administration, Tian Fang, Shi Dongshan, Zhong Jingzhi, Ye Yiqun, Luo Guangda, Qian Xiaozhang, Yu Ji, Chen Bo, and others, totaling twenty people, discussed issues related to the Soviet film industry. Feodorov gave a detailed introduction to the overall situation of Soviet films, as well as the formulation and completion of production plans, cinemas, and projection teams. He pointed out that Soviet films have achieved brilliant achievements under the guidance of Lenin's and Stalin's artistic ideas. The Soviet films, based on the needs of educating the masses to love the motherland and love labor, the demands of the broad masses, and the instructions of the Communist Party and the government, can be completed ahead of schedule and surpass the plan. The Soviet projectionists are both technicians and political propagandists, and they are constantly improving their political and technical levels under the leadership of the Communist Party and the government.

    At another symposium, Feodorov talked about scientific popularization films. More than 30 people participated in this symposium, including Wang Lanxi, Cai Chusheng, Hong Lin, and representatives from the Agricultural Film Studio of the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government, the Propaganda Department of the Ministry of Health, the Film Studio of the General Political Department of the People's Revolutionary Military Commission, and the China Association for Science and Technology Popularization. In his speech, Feodorov pointed out that scientific popularization films are a powerful educational tool in the Soviet Union. In production and construction, it enables the rapid promotion of advanced working methods. During the Patriotic War, it educated the people to learn the military scientific knowledge to strike the enemy. It also played a significant role in the post-war economic recovery. Each production department customizes a large number of scientific educational films from the film administration every year and shows them in factories and rural areas throughout the country. Schools across the country also use scientific popularization films to teach students. Feodorov also introduced the experience of organizing and leading the production of scientific educational films, the production process, the production methods, and how national scientific experts help in the production of scientific educational films. In the above two symposiums, Feodorov answered many specific questions raised by Chinese film workers; he also repeatedly and kindly asked what else Chinese film workers needed to know. He said that one of the purposes of their coming to China was to tell Chinese film workers all his work experience.

    At a symposium attended by more than 40 Chinese film and drama actors, including Sang Fu and Shu Shi, Chirkov, a representative of the Supreme Soviet, a Soviet People's Actor, a Stalin Prize winner, and a famous actor, spoke about performance issues. He first introduced his experience in film work, and then took his starring roles in "The Maxim Trilogy," "Court of Honor," and "Donbas Miners" as examples to illustrate that actors must understand real life and base themselves on real life in order to create good roles. Chirkov believes that Chinese film workers have successfully preserved national characteristics in film art, and the Chinese film "The White-Haired Girl" made a deep impression on him. He hopes to see more of China's natural scenery, Chinese life, and Chinese cities and villages in Chinese films. During a break in the symposium, Liu Shilong, a student at the Film School of the Central Film Bureau, presented Chirkov with the "Huaihai Campaign Medal" and the "Crossing the River Campaign Medal" that he had won in the Liberation War. These two precious gifts deeply moved Chirkov, and he warmly embraced Liu Shilong. Sun Yu, the actor who played Xiao Liu in the film "Steel Fighter," also shook hands with Chirkov to express his greetings. Chirkov patted him on the shoulder kindly and said, "You have grown up." Chirkov also gave signed photos to Liu Shilong and Sun Yu to commemorate the meeting.

    Chirkasov, a representative of the Supreme Soviet, a Soviet People's Actor, a Stalin Prize winner, and the star of the films "Baltic Deputy" and "Ingenious Inventor," discussed acting art with more than 20 Chinese film and drama workers, including Tian Fang, Shui Hua, Chen Ge, Hu Peng, Lan Ma, Zhang Fa, Shi Yu, and Mu Hong. He was always enthusiastic during the symposium. With his more than 30 years of exceptionally rich artistic life experience, he profoundly explained the similarities and differences between stage performance and film performance, how to play the image of leaders, how to play historical figures, how actors and directors carry out creative cooperation, and how the Soviet Union trains young actors. He said that he had performed "Ivan the Terrible" 238 times on stage, and he did not feel that he had mastered the character until the fiftieth time. This proves that actors must constantly train in performance. He also said at the meeting that in the future, when he stood in front of the camera, he must think of the Chinese people and perform the play better. This symposium gave the young Chinese actors a great education.

    Soviet People's Actress and Stalin Prize winner Radinina, who starred in films such as "Tractor Drivers," "Siberian Symphony," and "Happy Life," was invited to discuss acting art with Chinese film and drama workers. More than 40 people attended, including Yu Lan, Tian Hua, Ye Zi, Yang Luxi, and Han Bing. Radinina introduced a lot of information about Soviet actors' advanced studies. She emphasized that film actors should study politics. She said that Soviet film actors should study Marxism-Leninism and participate in various social lives. She introduced her own creative experience. She said that during the filming of "Happy Life," she lived in a collective farm in Baku to observe the work and life of farmers. The characters in this film had to speak with a Ukrainian accent, so she also learned to speak with a Ukrainian accent at home. When she wanted to learn to ride a horse, she often talked to the horse breeders of the collective farm a lot, so that the horse breeders asked her if she wanted to work in the stables. Her vivid and concrete talks gave the audience an extremely deep impression. At the meeting, she also sang a song at everyone's request. The symposium was extremely pleasant and lively.

    The director symposium widely involved various aspects of film directing work, and the atmosphere was very warm. More than 30 Chinese film and drama directors and musicians, including Zhang Min, Shi Dongshan, Cheng Yin, He Shide, Wu Zuguang, Yi Ming, Lu Ban, Yi Lin, Shi Hui, and Liu Yumin, participated in this symposium. Petrov, a Soviet People's Actor, a Stalin Prize winner, and the director of films such as "Guilty Without Guilt," "Peter the Great," "Kutuzov," and "The Battle of Stalingrad," spoke freely about his valuable experience in directing work at the meeting on the issues raised by Chinese film directors. He particularly emphasized the importance of cooperation between directors and screenwriters, composers, and actors. Petrov gave a very detailed introduction to the production process of his film "The Battle of Stalingrad." His rich experience gave Chinese film directors great inspiration. At the symposium, Petrov also talked about the writing and directing of historical films and children's films, and about the creation of leader images. Petrov finally said: "Only our country and your country can produce such a huge film as 'The Battle of Stalingrad,' and only our troops and people can regard such work as their own business. I believe that in the near future, you will also produce great films of heroic images in the Liberation War."

    Soviet screenwriter and Stalin Prize winner Smirnova, the author of films such as "The Village Teacher," "A True Man," and "Rural Doctor," discussed screenwriting issues with Chinese film workers. More than 50 Chinese film screenwriters, including Wang Zhenzhi, Yu Min, Sun Qian, and Ge Qin, participated in the symposium. The guests and hosts had a close conversation for six hours at the meeting. Smirnova gave a detailed introduction to the screenwriting experience of "The Village Teacher" and "Rural Doctor," and answered more than ten questions raised by Chinese screenwriters, such as the cooperative relationship between film screenwriters and directors. She explained that based on her experience, a screenwriter must go deep into real life, be familiar with the character and thoughts of typical characters, and be good at listening to the opinions and criticisms of the masses in order to improve his creation. Smirnova's concise and profound talk was warmly welcomed by Chinese film workers. She also expressed her hope to have another opportunity to further exchange work experience with Chinese film workers.

    Soviet cinematographer, Honored Art Worker of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, Stalin Prize winner and filmmaker of “Siberian Symphony” and “Happy Life” Pavolov, and more than 30 Chinese cinematographers held a symposium on cinematography technology issues. Attendees included Stalin Prize winners Xu Xiaobing, Wu Benli, Su Heqing, Li Hua, Xu Lai, and Chinese cinematographers Ma Shouqing and Lu Ming. At the meeting, Pavolov introduced the rich experience of Soviet film work, such as the complexity of musical films and the difference between newsreels and feature films in cinematography technology. He emphasized: As a news film photographer, one must have a high degree of political sensitivity, understand the needs of the people, and be the first to know everything that happens among the masses. He said that news photographers should reflect reality truthfully like journalists, work meticulously and meticulously like painters, not miss a target like anti-aircraft gunners, and should also master technology well and be familiar with the properties of film. Pavolov also encouraged Chinese film photography to strive to learn color film. The symposium continued for eight hours. Pavolov's speech was always full of enthusiasm, and he expressed infinite and far-reaching expectations for China's film industry.
