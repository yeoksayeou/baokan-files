Refuting the US's So-Called "No Forced Repatriation"
Chen Tiqiang, International Law Expert, Deputy Director of the Compilation Committee of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs

The Korean armistice negotiations, which concern the future of world peace, were interrupted on October 8 due to the US's sabotage. During these sixteen months, the US representatives, adhering to the will of Wall Street, spared no base means to obstruct, delay, and undermine the negotiations in order to guarantee the wartime profiteering of American millionaires. However, because the Chinese and Korean representatives, who were constantly concerned about the world's people's desire for peace, exercised extreme patience and adhered to fair and reasonable proposals, both sides finally reached a draft armistice agreement including sixty-three articles. If the US had implemented the draft armistice agreement that it had agreed to, peace would have been achieved long ago. However, for sixteen months, the US, disregarding the universally recognized principles of the Geneva Convention and the provisions of Article 51 of the armistice agreement draft that it had agreed to, created extraneous issues on the issue of prisoner repatriation, making all sorts of unreasonable demands, so that the negotiations dragged on month after month, and the prisoners of war on both sides who were looking forward to returning home to live peaceful lives could not return home, and the war continued to deprive thousands of people of their precious lives day by day.

Regarding the issue of prisoner repatriation, the Chinese and Korean sides have always adhered to one position, that is, any solution must strictly comply with the provisions of the Geneva Convention. The Geneva Convention is the crystallization of hundreds of years of experience in dealing with prisoners of war in a humanitarian spirit, and has become a solemn international legal rule after being signed by countries around the world. It absorbed the lessons of the First World War in 1929, and the lessons of the Second World War in 1949, becoming its present form, so it is more in line with the needs of prisoners of war in modern warfare, and more fully embodies the humanitarian concept in modern warfare law. The United States was a country that participated in the 1949 Geneva Conference and signed the convention. In the Korean War, the US government repeatedly declared its willingness to abide by the provisions of the convention. Therefore, it is clear that the Geneva Convention constitutes the most reasonable and only basis for resolving the prisoner of war issue by both sides in the Korean War. The Chinese and Korean sides' insistence on abiding by the Geneva Convention is not only adhering to a universally recognized international principle on the treatment of prisoners of war, but also adhering to the most reasonable proposal for resolving the prisoner of war issue. In contrast, the US side's insistence on so-called "voluntary repatriation," later renamed so-called "no forced repatriation," not only blatantly violates the Geneva Convention, but is also unreasonable in itself.

Regardless of what labels the US puts on its proposal, it is still completely untenable in law. Everyone knows that prisoners of war are captured by the opposing side by force on the battlefield and controlled by force. Therefore, prisoners of war are basically in a state of being forced during detention, not in a state of freedom. What is the freest state and the most humane treatment for them? That is to release and repatriate them to return home to live a peaceful life, which absolutely does not need to be forced. In other words, when prisoners of war are in the hands of the opposing side, they are being forced, while when they are repatriated, the state of being forced simply does not exist, so the so-called "no forced repatriation" issue is simply impossible to occur. Precisely for this reason, the Geneva Convention, with humanitarianism as its basic spirit, explicitly stipulates in Article 118: "Prisoners of war shall be released and repatriated without delay after the cessation of active hostilities." This provision is completely unconditional. Because if any conditions are raised here, it may allow the detaining party that intends to forcibly detain prisoners of war to use some so-called exceptions or accidents, or situations not fully mentioned in the article, to create reasons to forcibly detain prisoners of war. At the same time, precisely for this reason, the Geneva Convention could not possibly stipulate so-called "no forced repatriation" in the article, so as to prevent any detaining country that intends to forcibly detain prisoners of war from using it to achieve its cruel and inhumane purposes.

Not only that, but the Geneva Convention further elaborately formulates provisions to combat any conspiracy to forcibly detain prisoners of war with the so-called "no forced repatriation" proposal. Article 7 of the convention stipulates: "Prisoners of war may in no circumstances renounce in part or in entirety the rights secured to them by the present Convention, and by the special agreements referred to in the foregoing Article, should such exist." This provision is absolute and unconditional. "In any circumstances" of course does not allow any exceptions. Regarding this point, the 1949 Geneva Conference had a detailed discussion. In that conference, the special committee discussed a proposal: "Prisoners of war shall in no circumstances be compelled or induced by other methods of coercion to relinquish in part or in entirety the inalienable rights secured to them by this Convention..." The special committee rejected this proposal on the grounds that: first, the prohibited relinquishment of rights should not be limited to "inalienable" rights, but all rights; second, the prohibited act of relinquishment should not be limited to acts of relinquishment caused by "compulsion or inducement by other methods of coercion," but all acts of relinquishment. From this, it can be seen that the Geneva Convention has not failed to consider the occurrence of the bad situation of prisoners of war "voluntarily relinquishing" the right to be repatriated. Furthermore, precisely because it saw that this so-called "voluntary relinquishment" is actually "forced relinquishment," that is, so-called "no forced repatriation," it made the provisions of Article 7 to eliminate any possibility of "relinquishing" the right to be repatriated, that is, the possibility of so-called "no forced repatriation," to protect the true interests of prisoners of war. From here, people can clearly see that the Geneva Convention not only does not approve of so-called "no forced repatriation," but absolutely opposes this inhumane proposal, which is essentially completely about detaining prisoners of war.

What is even more egregious is that, in order to achieve the purpose of forced detention, the US has conducted barbaric political "screening" among the captured personnel of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers; it has used political torture such as beatings, abuses, forced fingerprinting, and forced tattooing, which even the former US prisoner-of-war camp commander Colson and the so-called International Committee of the Red Cross have had to admit, to coerce the Chinese and Korean prisoners of war, attempting to obliterate their will to demand repatriation, and妄想 to obtain the excuse that prisoners of war "do not want to be repatriated" and therefore "no forced repatriation" from here. However, not only has the Geneva Convention already clearly stipulated that this so-called "relinquishment" of the right to repatriation is illegal and invalid, but the heroic struggle of the captured Chinese and Korean personnel in all US prisoner-of-war camps has thoroughly proven that the US's so-called prisoners of war "do not want to be repatriated" and therefore "no forced repatriation" is the most shameless public fabrication. The bloody fact is: the US has consistently violated the Geneva Convention and forcibly detained prisoners of war with brutal force. The "no forced repatriation" that it is now forcing the United Nations General Assembly to accept is a tool, the purpose of which is to use it to force other countries in the United Nations to recognize that its forced detention of prisoners of war with brutal force is legal. If the peace-loving countries in the United Nations actually follow the US and accept its so-called "no forced repatriation," that would be causing endless disasters of being forcibly detained by force in the future for their own people.

The Chinese and Korean people absolutely cannot accept this "no forced repatriation" aimed at detaining prisoners of war, to betray the right to unconditional repatriation that the captured Chinese and Korean personnel have defended with life-and-death struggles. We absolutely cannot accept this trick of undermining international regulations and humanitarian traditions, the so-called "no forced repatriation," to open the door wide for the forcible detention of prisoners of war advocated and implemented by the US imperialists, so that millions of people of all countries will suffer infinitely miserable fates when they unfortunately become prisoners of war in the future.

The US is also attempting to support its so-called "no forced repatriation" by sending the so-called "unwilling to be repatriated" prisoners of war to the demilitarized zone to be released, allowing them to "act freely" and not repatriating them. This is another cover-up by the US for forcibly detaining prisoners of war, and it completely violates the Geneva Convention. The US side has long sent a large number of Chiang Kai-shek and Syngman Rhee bandit gangs' agents mixed among the prisoners of war, which American journalists have always admitted and reported. Prisoners of war under the constant threat of these agents have absolutely no possibility of "acting freely." Not only that, but the so-called "free action" of prisoners of war is precisely a tool that the detaining country can use to detain prisoners of war. It is by no means a demand that prisoners of war may have themselves, because what prisoners of war want is to be sent home and reunited with their beloved families. No prisoner of war would be willing to drift in a foreign land or remain in the hands of the enemy to be used as cannon fodder with so-called "free action" and be unwilling to return home.

Precisely for this reason, the Geneva Convention, in order to protect the interests of prisoners of war, clearly stipulates "release and repatriation." "Release" and "repatriation" are inseparable and indispensable. The convention requires "repatriation" in addition to "release"; if there is only "release" without "repatriation," then it cannot be said to have fulfilled the obligations of the convention. The English word for "repatriation" is Repatriation, which, according to Webster's Dictionary, is "to restore to one's country," that is, to return to the side where one's family is located. If a prisoner of war is "released" but does not return to his own side, then he cannot be considered "repatriated." The only way to guarantee that prisoners of war can return to their own side is for the detaining country to hand them over to the other side, as stipulated in the Chinese and Korean side's October 8th proposal. The convention stipulates that prisoners of war must be "repatriated" in order to ensure that prisoners of war can return to their own side.

This method is also recognized in international practice. For example, Article 13 of the 1905 Russo-Japanese Peace Treaty stipulates that prisoners of war on both sides must be "mutually returned"; special committees shall be organized by both sides, and prisoners of war "shall be handed over to the other government's committee." Another example is Article 6 of the 1871 Franco-Prussian Peace Treaty, Article 9 of the 1913 treaty between Bulgaria, Greece, etc. and Serbia, the 1898 US-Spanish Peace Treaty, and the armistice agreements during World War II, all of which stipulate that prisoners of war should be "immediately returned."

This is the only correct path for dealing with the issue of prisoners of war. In the draft armistice agreement agreed upon by the Chinese and Korean sides and the US side, both sides have unconditionally accepted this solution. Article 51 of the draft stipulates: "All prisoners of war held in custody by each side at the time this Armistice Agreement becomes effective shall be released and repatriated as expeditiously as possible. ..." This is as clear as can be: "Release" and "repatriation" cannot be neglected. And the so-called "repatriation" must be the handing over of prisoners of war from one side to the other side's authorities. This point has been clearly pointed out in the notes attached to the article: "The act of one side handing over prisoners of war to the other side ... is called 'repatriation' in Chinese." It is very clear that allowing prisoners of war to act freely after "release" cannot be regarded as "the act of handing over to the other side."

International practice, the Geneva Convention, and the Korean Armistice Agreement draft all stipulate that prisoners of war must be "handed over to the other side," because prisoners of war are the people of the other side, their interests are completely consistent with the interests of their own country, and only through their own country can their interests be fully guaranteed. For example, prisoners of war under the enemy's strong control, although the Geneva Convention stipulates the detaining country's obligation to protect them for their benefit, they cannot force the enemy to fulfill the obligations imposed on the enemy by international conventions. They can only rely on their own side to protect them. Their own side, with the status of an equal belligerent, can use various methods to put pressure on the enemy, forcing the enemy to abide by international regulations and fulfill international obligations. This is one. Secondly, the ultimate and greatest interest of prisoners of war, that is, the realization of the desire to return home to live a peaceful life, is only possible after repatriation, that is, handing them over to their own side. The US imperialists refuse to hand over the captured Chinese and Korean personnel to their own side, but want to "release" them without repatriating them, and hire defense lawyers to hopelessly attempt to pit the interests of the prisoners of war against the interests of the prisoners of war's country. This is precisely because they want to deprive the prisoners of war of the right to be protected by their own side, so that they can use agents and various brutal acts to forcibly detain these prisoners of war.

In summary, whether it is so-called "no forced repatriation" or so-called "voluntary repatriation," the US's goal is still the same, unreasonably demanding the forced detention of captured personnel from the Chinese and Korean sides. If their unreasonable demands are allowed to prevail, then the entire principle, purpose, and spirit of the Geneva Convention will be completely destroyed, and the humanitarian tradition of dealing with the issue of prisoners of war will be destroyed by it. We, the Chinese people, firmly do not allow this unreasonable demand to be realized. The people of the whole world must also never allow this unreasonable demand to be realized.

    斥美国所谓“不强迫遣返”
    国际法专家、中国人民外交学会编译委员会副主任  陈体强
    关系着全世界和平前途的朝鲜停战谈判，于十月八日由于美方的破坏而中断。在这十六个月当中，秉承华尔街意旨的美方代表，为了保证美国亿万富翁的战时暴利，不惜用种种卑污手段来阻挠、拖延和破坏谈判的进行。但是由于时时刻刻关怀全世界人民对和平的渴望的中朝代表尽了极大的忍耐，坚持公平合理的主张，终于双方达成了包括六十三款的停战协定草案。只要美方按照它自己所同意的停战协定草案去执行，和平早已实现。可是十六个月以来，美方不顾日内瓦公约举世公认的原则，不顾自己所同意的停战协定草案第五十一条的规定，在遣俘问题上横生枝节，提出种种无理的要求，以致谈判月复一月地拖延下去，每天盼望着回家过和平日子的双方战俘还不能回家，战争还在一天天地剥夺千百人的宝贵生命。
    关于遣俘问题，中朝方面始终坚持着一个立场，即任何解决方案必须严格符合日内瓦公约的规定。日内瓦公约是数百年来以人道主义精神处理战俘问题的经验的结晶，经过世界各国签订而成为庄严的国际法规则。它在一九二九年吸取了第一次世界大战的经验教训，一九四九年又吸取了第二次世界大战的经验教训，成为今日的形式，因而它更能符合现代战争中的战俘的需要，并且更充分地体现了现代战争法中的人道观念。美国是参加一九四九年日内瓦会议的国家，并且在公约上签了字。在朝鲜战争中，美国政府曾一再宣称愿意遵守公约的规定。因此，很明显的，日内瓦公约构成了在朝鲜的作战双方解决战俘问题最合理的、也是唯一的基础。中朝方面坚持遵守日内瓦公约，不仅是坚持遵守一个举世公认的关于处理战俘的国际原则，而且是坚持一个解决战俘问题的最合理的主张。与此相反，美国方面所坚持的所谓“自愿遣返”，后来又改名为所谓“不强迫遣返”的主张，不仅是悍然违背了日内瓦公约，并且其本身也是不合理的。
    不管美国在它的主张上贴些什么商标，它在法理上仍然是完全站不住脚的。人人知道战俘是在战场上被敌对方面以武力俘获，并且以武力控制的。因此，战俘在拘留期间，根本是处在被强迫的状态之下，而不是处在自由的状态之下。对于他们，什么是最自由的状态，是最人道的待遇呢？那就是释放与遣返他们回家过和平生活，这是绝对用不着强迫的。换句话说，当战俘在敌对一方手中的时候，他们是被强迫的，而当他们被遣返的时候，则强迫状态根本就不存在，因此，所谓“不强迫遣返”的问题根本就不可能发生。正因如此，以人道主义为其基本精神的日内瓦公约就在一百十八条中明确规定：“实际战事停止后，战俘应即予释放并遣返，不得迟延”。这一规定是完全无条件的。因为如果在这里举出任何条件，即有可能使蓄意强迫扣留战俘的拘留一方得以藉口某种所谓例外或意外，或条文中未能完全提明的情况，而制造理由来强迫扣留战俘。同时，也正因此，日内瓦公约就不可能在条文中规定所谓“不强迫遣返”，以免任何有意强迫扣留战俘的拘留国家加以利用，来达到其残酷的、不人道的目的。
    不仅如此，日内瓦公约并且更进一步严密地制定条文，以打击任何想以所谓“不强迫遣返”的主张来强迫扣留战俘的阴谋。公约第七条规定：“在任何情况下战俘不得放弃本公约或上条所述特别协定——如其订有是项协定——所赋予彼等权利之一部或全部”。这规定是绝对的，也是无条件的。“在任何情况下”当然不允许任何例外。关于这点，一九四九年日内瓦会议曾加以详细讨论。在那次会议中，特别委员会曾讨论一个提案：“战俘在任何情况下不得被强制或用其它胁迫方法诱使放弃本公约……所赋予彼等的不可割让的权利之一部或全部”。特别委员会否决了这个提案，理由是：第一，禁止放弃的权利不应限于“不可割让的”的权利，而是所有权利；第二，禁止的放弃行为不应限于由于“强制或用其它胁迫方法诱使”而成的放弃行为，而是一切放弃行为。由此可见，日内瓦公约不是没有考虑到所谓战俘“自愿地放弃”被遣返权利的恶劣情况的发生。并且，正因为看到这种所谓“自愿放弃”，实际上就是“强迫放弃”，也就是所谓“不强迫遣返”，因此它才作出第七条的规定，以杜绝任何
    “放弃”被遣返权利的可能性，也就是所谓“不强迫遣返”的可能性，来保障战俘的真正利益。从这里，人们可以清楚地看到日内瓦公约不仅是不赞成所谓“不强迫遣返”，而且是绝对反对这种不人道的、实质上完全是扣留战俘的主张的。
    尤有进者，美方为了达到强迫扣留之目的，在朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军被俘人员中间进行野蛮的政治“甄别”；以美国前战俘营长官柯尔生和所谓红十字国际委员会都不得不承认的毒打、虐杀、强迫打指印、强迫刺字等政治拷问来威逼中朝战俘，企图磨灭他们要求遣返回家的意志，妄想从这里可以得到战俘“不愿遣返”因而“不强迫遣返”的口实。可是，不仅日内瓦公约早已明白规定，这种所谓“放弃”遣返权利是非法的，是无效的，就是中朝被俘人员在美方所有战俘营中的壮烈斗争也已经彻底证明了美方的所谓战俘“不愿遣返”因而“不强迫遣返”，是最不知耻的公开捏造。血腥的事实是：美国一贯违反日内瓦公约，以残暴武力强迫扣留战俘。它现在正逼迫联合国大会加以接受的“不强迫遣返”乃是一种工具，目的是用它来迫使联合国中其他国家承认其以残暴武力强迫扣留战俘是合法的。如果联合国中爱好和平的国家竟然追随美国，接受其所谓“不强迫遣返”，那就是替他们自己的人民惹起将来被以武力强迫扣留的无穷灾祸。
    中朝人民绝对不能接受这种旨在扣留战俘的“不强迫遣返”，来出卖中朝被俘人员以生死斗争来保卫的无条件遣返的权利。我们绝对不能够接受这种破坏国际法规和人道传统的所谓“不强迫遣返”的诡计，来为美帝国主义者所主张并加以实施的武力强迫扣留战俘主张大开方便之门，使将来千百万各国人民在不幸而成为战俘时，遭受无限悲惨的命运。
    美国又企图以把所谓“不愿遣返”的战俘送到非军事区加以释放，听其“自由行动”，不予遣返的办法来支持所谓“不强迫遣返”。这又是美方武力强迫扣留战俘的遮眼法，而且完全是违反日内瓦公约的。美国方面长期派有大批蒋介石李承晚匪帮的特务混杂在战俘中间，这是美国新闻记者向来承认并且报道了的。战俘在这种特务的经常武力威迫之下，是根本没有什么“自由行动”的可能的。不仅如此，所谓战俘的“自由行动”正是拘留国家可以用来扣留战俘的工具，它决不是战俘自己可能有的要求，因为战俘所要的是被遣送回家，与其亲爱的家人们团聚。绝无任何战俘会有情愿以所谓“自由行动”来流落异乡或者留在敌国手上被当作炮灰而不情愿回家的道理。
    正因此，所以日内瓦公约为了保障战俘的利益，明明白白地规定“释放并遣返”，“释放”和“遣返”是不可分开的，缺一不可的。公约除“释放”之外并要求“遣返”；如果仅有“释放”而无“遣返”，那就不能说是履行了公约的义务。“遣返”
    一辞英文为Repatriation，照韦氏大辞典的解释，是“回复于一个人的国家”，也就是回到自己家庭所在的一方。假使一个战俘被“释放”而没有回到自己的所属一方，那就不能算是“遣返”。唯一保证战俘能返回自己所属一方的办法就是由拘留国把他们移交给对方，正如朝中方面十月八日方案所规定的一样。公约规定战俘必须“遣返”，目的是要保证战俘能回到自己所属一方。
    这种办法在国际惯例上也是被公认了的。例如一九○五年日俄和约第十三条规定：双方战俘必须“相互交还”；由双方组织特种委员会，战俘“应移交给对方政府的委员会”。又如一八七一年普法和约第六条，一九一三年保加利亚、希腊等国与塞尔维亚间的和约第九条、一八九八年美西和约以及第二次世界大战期间的停战协定，都是规定战俘应“立即交还”。
    这是处理战俘问题的唯一正路。在中朝方面和美方所协议的停战协定草案中，双方已无保留地接受了这个解决方案。该草案第五十一条规定：“本停战协定生效时各方所收容的全部战俘须尽速予以释放与遣返。……”这里再清楚也没有：“释放”和“遣返”是不能偏废的。而所谓“遣返”必须是由一方将战俘交给对方当局。这点该条所附注释中已明白指出：“一方将战俘交与对方的行动……在中文中称为‘遣返’”。于战俘“释放”后，任其自由行动，不能算作“交与对方的行动”，至为显然。
    国际惯例、日内瓦公约和朝鲜停战协定草案都规定要“将战俘交与对方”，因为战俘是对方的人民，他们的利益和他们的所属国家的利益是完全一致的，而且只有通过他们自己的所属国家，他们的利益才能得到完全的保障。例如处于敌人强力控制之下的战俘，虽然是有了日内瓦公约为他们的利益所规定的拘留国对他们的保护义务，但他们却无法强制敌方履行国际公约所加之于敌方的义务，他们只有依靠自己的所属一方来保障他们。他们的所属一方以对等的交战者地位，可以用各种办法对敌方施以压力，迫使敌方来遵守国际法规，履行国际义务。这是一。其次，战俘的最终也是最大的利益，也就是回家过和平生活的愿望之实现，也只有在遣返，即把他们交给他们的所属一方之后，才有可能。美帝国主义者不肯将朝中被俘人员交与他们的所属方面，而要将他们“释放”不予遣返，并且雇用辩护士来无望地企图将战俘的利益与战俘所属国的利益对立起来，这正是因为他们要剥夺战俘受自己的所属方面保护的权利，以便他们利用特务和种种残暴行为来强迫扣留这些战俘。
    总起来说，不管是所谓“不强迫遣返”，还是所谓“自愿遣返”，美国的目的还是万变不离其宗，无理主张强迫扣留朝中方面被俘人员。如果容许他们的这种无理主张得势，那么整个日内瓦公约的原则、宗旨和精神都要完全破坏，处理战俘问题的人道传统就要被其毁灭。我们中国人民坚决不容许这一无理主张实现。全世界人民也绝不可以容许这一无理主张实现。
