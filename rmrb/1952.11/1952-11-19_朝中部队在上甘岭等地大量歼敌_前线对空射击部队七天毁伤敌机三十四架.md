Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 18th—The Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers continue to fight bravely in the cold weather after the first snow on November 7th. Our forces on the front north of Kimhwa are fighting with increasing vigor, continuing the fierce battle on the mountain ridge to the left of Shangganling with the enemy who are unwilling to accept defeat. On the evening of the 11th, our forces launched another counterattack to occupy the enemy's fortifications on the mountaintop. The counterattacking troops and the troops defending the tunnels joined together and engaged in a fierce battle with the enemy for less than two hours, completely annihilating an entire battalion of the defending puppet Li army. Later, the mountaintop fortifications were again occupied by the enemy. On the evening of the 13th, our forces launched another counterattack, and after half an hour of battle, they completely recovered all the mountaintop fortifications. On the mountain ridge to the right of Shangganling, after our forces completely recovered all the field positions on the mountaintop on October 30th, the enemy concentrated a large number of air force and artillery to cover infantry regiments attacking continuously. However, for several days, the enemy only suffered heavy casualties without any results; by November 6th, they had to completely retreat in defeat. On the night of the 8th, the enemy sent a platoon slowly advancing towards this mountain ridge. After being bombarded by our artillery fire, they hurriedly retreated. On the night of the 13th, the enemy used more than one company to attack the forward positions of this mountain ridge and were immediately repelled by our forces.

In the past week, our forces in other front areas have also continued counterattacks after the first snow. In the area south of Goseong on the east coast, our forces launched counterattacks on the evenings of the 9th and 10th, once capturing four enemy positions near Daegang-ri. Including the results of repelling enemy counterattacks, preliminary statistics show that more than 750 enemy troops were annihilated. In the western front area, on the night of the 10th, our forces captured the North Mountain of Shixian-dong, northwest of Lianchuan, completely annihilating a U.S. Army company of more than 160 men.

From November 7th to 13th, our frontline artillery units killed or wounded more than 800 enemy troops. In these seven days, frontline anti-aircraft units shot down 14 enemy planes and damaged 20.

    朝中部队在上甘岭等地大量歼敌
    前线对空射击部队七天毁伤敌机三十四架
    【新华社朝鲜前线十八日电】朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军在十一月七日初雪之后的寒冷气候里继续奋勇作战。在金化以北前线的我军部队愈战愈勇，继续在上甘岭左边山岭上与吃了败仗不甘心的敌人进行激烈的争夺战。十一日黄昏我军再度反击占据山顶工事的敌人，反击部队和坚守坑道的部队会合在一起，同敌人进行不到两小时的激烈战斗，就把守敌李伪军一个营全部歼灭。以后山顶工事又被敌人占领，到十三日晚上，我军又再次举行反击，经半小时战斗，又将山顶工事全部收复。在上甘岭右边山岭上，我军自十月三十日把山头野战阵地全部收复后，敌人集中大量空军和炮兵掩护成营成团的步兵连续攻击，但是一连数日敌人只是死伤累累，毫无结果；到十一月六日不得不完全败下阵去。敌人在八日夜里曾派一个排向着这个山岭缓慢地前进，受到我军炮火一阵轰击，便急急忙忙地缩了回去。十三日夜里，敌人又用一个多连兵力向这座山岭的前沿阵地进攻，当即被我军击退。
    在最近一周里，其他前线地区的我军部队也在初雪以后继续反击作战。在东海岸高城以南地区，我军在九、十两日晚上发起反击，一度攻占大康里附近四处敌军阵地，连同击退敌人反扑的战果在内，初步统计歼敌七百五十多名。在西线地区，十日夜里我军攻占涟川西北石岘洞北山，全歼守敌美军一个连，计一百六十多名。
    自十一月七日到十三日，我前线炮兵部队共击毙击伤敌军八百多名。前线对空射击部队在这七天里，共击落敌机十四架，击伤敌机二十架。
