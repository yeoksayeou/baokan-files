    Some Cadres of the CPC Minhou County Committee Do Not Value Learning
    Comrade Editor: On the morning of October 6th, I was studying Volume Two of the Selected Works of Mao Zedong at the CPC Fujian Province Minhou County Committee. Seven comrades from the county committee were studying the "Instructions on Autumn Harvest Work" issued by the Fujian Provincial People's Government, published in the October 4th Fujian Daily. We started studying at 6:00 AM. After fifteen minutes, they finished reading the instructions and decided to discuss them. I also wanted to listen to their discussion (because the instructions had just been published, and I hadn't studied them yet). Five minutes passed, and no one spoke. After 6:20 AM, one comrade brought up the topic of watches, and then everyone started talking about watches. From watches, they moved on to bicycles, gramophones, movies, railways, and so on. They talked until 7:30 AM when the breakfast whistle blew, and everyone ended this "discussion." After breakfast, I talked to one of the responsible comrades, and he said: "Because there were no unified arrangements for learning, reading the newspaper was just to fill up this learning time; it has been like this for several days." On the morning of October 7th, I paid special attention to their learning. That morning, they were studying Comrade Bo Yibo's article "The Achievements of the People's Republic of China in the Past Three Years." Again, they read two paragraphs and started chatting idly. After fifteen minutes of chatting, the comrade I had spoken to yesterday quickly corrected everyone and continued reading. But everyone still seemed restless.
    Although this is a small issue, it reflects the learning situation of cadres in a county committee office. As far as I know, the learning of many district cadres and work team comrades is undisciplined. Sometimes, they don't even read the newspaper, and they even leave the learning materials sent by higher authorities untouched. If we Communist Party members, Communist Youth League members, and all revolutionary workers do not study hard, we will not be able to complete, or even find it difficult to complete, the tasks assigned to us by our great motherland. I suggest that the CPC Minhou County Committee and the various district committees must pay attention to the learning of cadres in the offices and work teams.

    中共闽侯县委员会有些干部不重视学习
    编辑同志：十月六日早上，我在中共福建省闽侯县委会学习毛泽东选集第二卷，县委会的七个同志学习十月四日福建日报刊载的福建省人民政府“关于秋收工作指示”。上午六时开始学习，十五分钟后他们读完了这个指示，并决定要讨论。我也想听听他们的讨论（因为这个指示刚公布，我也没有学习过）。五分钟过去了，没有人发言。六点二十分以后，一个同志提起手表问题，接着大家都谈起手表来。从手表谈到脚踏车、留声机、电影、铁路等等。谈到七点半钟，吃早饭的哨子响了，大家才结束了这场“讨论”。早饭后，我和其中的一位负责同志谈起，他说：“因学习没有统一布置，读报也是为了凑足这个学习时间；已有好几天都是这样。”十月七日早上，我就特别注意他们的学习。这一天早上是学习薄一波同志的“中华人民共和国三年来的成就”一文，又是读了两段便谈起闲话来。谈了十五分钟，昨天和我谈话的那位同志才赶快把大家纠正过来继续读下去。但大家仍表现了不很安心的样子。
    这虽是一个小问题，但却反映了一个县委机关干部的学习情况。据我了解有很多区干部和工作组同志的学习都是自流的，有时连报纸都不看，甚至把上级发给的学习材料也放着不看。我们共产党员、青年团员、全体革命工作人员如不努力学习，就不能完成最少也难于完成伟大祖国交给我们的任务。我建议中共闽侯县委会、各区委会必须注意机关干部和工作组干部的学习问题。
