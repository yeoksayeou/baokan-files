    Celebrating the 35th Anniversary of the Great and Glorious October Socialist Revolution
    Li Jishen, Vice-President of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association

    The entire Chinese people and peace-loving people around the world are celebrating the 35th anniversary of the Great Soviet October Socialist Revolution with unparalleled excitement and joy.

    On this great and glorious anniversary, we are filled with boundless excitement as we look back at the brilliant achievements of the Soviet Union's socialist construction over the past 35 years and witness the growing strength of the world peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union. We cannot but express our infinite respect to our great ally—the Soviet Union.

    On this great and glorious anniversary, we are also filled with boundless excitement as we look back at the unwavering sympathy and support of the Soviet Union for the cause of the Chinese people's revolution over the past 35 years, and witness the rapid recovery and development of our country's economy in the past three years under the Soviet Union's selfless assistance. We cannot but express our heartfelt gratitude to our great ally—the Soviet Union—and its great leader, Marshal Stalin.

    For more than a century after the Opium War, due to the intrusion of the brutal forces of imperialism, China was long reduced to a semi-colonial and semi-feudal state. Our great revolutionary forerunner, Dr. Sun Yat-sen, devoted his life to the struggle against imperialism and feudalism, persevering and making continuous efforts to seek freedom and equality for China. After countless hardships and lessons learned from repeated failures, Dr. Sun finally found the path of "following the Russian way," issuing the call to "take Russia as our teacher," and deciding on the three correct policies of "alliance with Russia," "alliance with the Communist Party," and "support for peasants and workers." All this demonstrates Dr. Sun's spirit of continuous progress in the revolutionary process, but the influence and assistance of the Soviet October Socialist Revolution and the Soviet Union at that time on Dr. Sun's revolutionary cause in various aspects was a major and decisive reason. Chairman Mao clearly pointed out in "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship:" "In despair, Sun Yat-sen encountered the October Revolution and the Chinese Communist Party, Sun Yat-sen welcomed the October Revolution, welcomed the Russian's help to the Chinese, and welcomed the Chinese Communist Party to cooperate with him." It also said: "The salvoes of the October Revolution brought us Marxism-Leninism. The October Revolution helped the advanced elements of the whole world, including China, to use the proletarian world outlook as an instrument for observing the destiny of the country and re-considering their own problems." From the revolutionary practice of the Chinese people's revolution led by the Chinese Communist Party for more than 30 years, we can fully see and deeply realize that "the cause of liberation of the Chinese nation and the Chinese people can only be truly assisted by socialist countries, socialist leaders, socialist people, socialist thinkers, politicians, and laborers; and our cause cannot achieve final victory without their assistance." Various historical facts prove that the reason why the Chinese people's revolution has achieved today's great victory is inseparable from the influence given by the Soviet October Socialist Revolution and from the long-term assistance given to the Chinese people by the Soviet people in various ways with a high degree of internationalist spirit.

    In the short three years since the founding of the People's Republic of China, our great motherland has received selfless and fraternal assistance from the Soviet government and the Soviet people in every aspect. This assistance has not only helped us consolidate our victory and defend the fruits of our victory; but also helped us create all favorable conditions for completing the New Democratic construction as soon as possible and laying a good foundation for the long-term prospects of socialist construction and communist construction.

    In the past three years, the Soviet Union has also continuously and vigorously assisted us diplomatically and in the international struggle against imperialism. On February 14, 1950, China and the Soviet Union concluded the "Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance." The signing of this alliance not only further consolidated and developed the unbreakable friendship between China and the Soviet Union, but also greatly improved our country's international status and strengthened the guarantee of our country's security. After suffering a shameful defeat on the Korean battlefield, the US imperialists have been clamoring to expand the Korean War. However, they have never dared to rashly launch a full-scale armed aggression against our country. The reason is the fear of the strength of the Sino-Soviet friendship alliance.

    In the past three years, the Soviet Union has also provided enormous assistance to our country's economic construction. The Soviet Union has provided our country with a huge loan of 300 million US dollars, enabling our country to immediately obtain various machinery, equipment and materials urgently needed for economic construction at the beginning of the country's founding after liberation, and to rapidly restore and develop our country's industrial and agricultural production, thereby increasing national wealth and improving people's lives. When the US imperialists imposed a "blockade" and "embargo" on our country, thanks to the trade agreement and the exchange of goods agreement signed between our two countries, our country not only did not suffer any impact or difficulties in foreign trade, but also greatly developed, and an unprecedented surplus situation occurred in the past 73 years. This cannot but shock the imperialists and complain endlessly, because they have reaped the bitter fruit of their "blockade" and "embargo."

    In addition, the Soviet Union's technical assistance has also played a significant role in our country's construction. In the past three years, Soviet experts have helped us solve many difficult problems in economic construction, accelerated the speed of our country's economic construction, and helped us establish brand-new modern factories and enterprises. At the same time, they have also helped us train a large number of construction talents who have mastered advanced technology. All this fully demonstrates the noble friendship of the Soviet people. The Chinese people will never forget this friendship.

    In cultural construction, the Soviet Union's assistance to us has also produced great results. In the past three years, the Soviet Union has sent many scholars and experts to our country to give lectures at our invitation, introducing to our people the theory and practice of Soviet socialist construction and the advanced academic thinking of the Soviet Union; and also introduced many advanced experiences in the education system, teaching content, and teaching methods. With the help of Soviet experts, we have established a completely new type of Renmin University of China. The school's educational policy is "combining Soviet experience with China's situation." It can be said that the progress of our country's cultural and educational undertakings in the past three years is astonishing, and basically implemented the New Democratic cultural and educational policies instructed by Chairman Mao. These advances and developments are inseparable from the help of Soviet scholars and experts.

    Our great motherland is about to carry out large-scale economic construction and cultural construction, and the people of the whole country are also preparing to welcome the high tide of this great construction. Facts tell us that learning from the Soviet Union's advanced construction experience is the guarantee of our country's construction victory. As Vice-Chairman Liu Shaoqi said: "Our Chinese people's revolution in the past was learning from the Soviet Union, 'taking Russia as our teacher,' so we were able to achieve such a victory today. In the future, we must also 'take Russia as our teacher' to build our country, and learn from the Soviet people's experience in building the country." In the past three years, we have learned from the Soviet Union's advanced construction experience, so we have received great results and achieved amazing results in both industrial and agricultural production; in the future, we must overcome conservative thinking and further learn from the Soviet Union's advanced experience, so that we can ensure the completion of our great construction tasks. The Soviet people have successfully completed socialist construction and are now advancing towards a communist society. We can only learn from the Soviet people, learn from their spirit of selfless labor, learn from all their advanced experiences, and learn from their great spirit of combining patriotism and internationalism; only then can we guarantee the successful implementation of New Democratic construction and build our great motherland into an independent, democratic, peaceful, unified, and prosperous country.

    The liberated Chinese people can better recognize from their own revolutionary struggles and victory process that the Soviet Union's assistance to the Chinese people, whether in the past, present, or future, is supreme selfless, upright, and aboveboard. This can not only be proved by iron-like facts in the past, but also can be clearly seen from the founding spirit of the Soviet Union, this great ally, and its foreign policy of "equality, mutual benefit, mutual respect for national sovereignty and territorial integrity, and non-interference in each other's internal affairs." We deeply understand that the Soviet Union is a socialist country under the dictatorship of the proletariat, which has eliminated capitalism and the exploiting classes, that is to say, it has eliminated all ideological sources of exploitation and enslavement. Therefore, the Soviet Union's assistance to us must be and can only be carried out with the proletariat's selfless and great spirit of combining patriotism and internationalism. This is completely different from the so-called "aid to China" by the US imperialists in the past, which was actually an act of aggression in name, both in content and method. The Chinese people's eyes are sharp, and their minds are clear. They sincerely welcome and gratefully appreciate the sincere and selfless assistance of friends; and they deeply hate and oppose the so-called "aid to China" by imperialists, which is hypocritical and deceitful. Chairman Mao has clearly instructed us: "We belong to the side of the anti-imperialist front headed by the Soviet Union in the international arena. True friendly assistance can only be found on this side, and cannot be found on the side of the imperialist front." This is an important inspiration, direction of learning, and basis for efforts for the people of the whole country.

    Now, on the occasion of the 35th anniversary of the victory of the great October Socialist Revolution in the Soviet Union, recalling the glorious past and looking forward to the victorious future makes us more aware of the importance of celebrating this great and glorious anniversary with jubilation. Marshal Stalin recently pointed out so kindly in his speech at the 19th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party: "Our party and our country have always needed in the past, and will continue to need in the future, the trust, sympathy, and support of the fraternal people of foreign countries... Naturally, our party cannot but repay the fraternal parties. It must also give them support, and at the same time must give their people support in their struggle for liberation and their struggle for peace." "The characteristic of this mutual support arises because: the interests of our party and the interests of the peace-loving people of all countries are not only not contradictory, but are integrated together." Let us, in the spirit of close friendship, unity, mutual assistance, and love between the people of China and the Soviet Union, strengthen learning from the great Soviet people, strengthen the fraternal and intimate friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union, and strengthen the peace and democratic camp headed by the Soviet Union. Let us jointly overthrow the makers of war and jointly strive for lasting peace and people's democracy in the world.

    庆祝伟大光荣的十月社会主义革命三十五周年
    中苏友好协会总会副会长  李济深
    全中国人民和全世界爱好和平的人民一起，以无比的兴奋和愉快的心情来庆祝伟大的苏联十月社会主义革命三十五周年纪念日。
    在这个伟大光荣的纪念日里，我们回顾过去三十五年来苏联社会主义建设的辉煌成就，眼见以苏联为首的世界和平民主阵营的日益壮大，真是感到无限兴奋。我们不能不向伟大的盟邦——苏联——表示无限的敬意。
    在这个伟大光荣的纪念日里，我们回顾过去三十五年来苏联对中国人民革命事业的始终不渝的同情和支援，眼见三年来我国经济在苏联的大公无私的援助下的迅速恢复和发展，也真是感到无限的兴奋。我们更不能不向伟大的盟邦——苏联——及其伟大领袖斯大林大元帅，表示衷心的感谢。
    在鸦片战争后百余年来，由于帝国主义残暴势力的侵入，中国长期沦于半殖民地半封建的境地。我们伟大的革命先行者孙中山先生毕生致力于反帝、反封建的斗争，百折不挠，再接再厉，以求中国之自由平等。孙先生经过无数的艰难困苦，遭受多次失败的经验教训，到了后来终于找到“走俄国人的路”发出“以俄为师”的号召，并决定了“联俄”“联共”“扶助农工”三大正确的政策。这一切固然表现了孙先生在革命过程中的不断前进的精神，但是苏联十月社会主义革命和当时苏联在各方面对于孙先生革命事业的影响与帮助，却是一个主要的决定性的原因。毛主席在“论人民民主专政”里明确地指出：“孙中山在绝望里，遇到了十月革命和中国共产党。孙中山欢迎十月革命，欢迎俄国人对中国人的帮助，欢迎中国共产党和他合作。”又说：“十月革命一声炮响，给我们送来了马克思列宁主义。十月革命帮助了全世界的也帮助了中国的先进分子，用无产阶级的宇宙观作为观察国家命运的工具，重新考虑自己的问题。”从中国共产党所领导的中国人民革命三十多年的革命实践中，我们完全可以看出并且也深深体会到：“中华民族和中国人民的解放事业，只有社会主义的国家、社会主义的领袖、社会主义的人民，社会主义的思想家、政治家、劳动者，才能真正援助；而我们的事业，没有他们的援助是不能取得最后胜利的。”种种历史事实证明，中国人民革命所以能获得今日的伟大胜利，是与苏联十月社会主义革命所给予的影响分不开的，是与苏联人民以高度的国际主义精神，长期地给予中国人民以各种不同方式的援助分不开的。
    中华人民共和国成立后的短短三年中，我们伟大的祖国，无论在那一方面都得到了苏联政府和苏联人民的大公无私的、兄弟般的亲切的援助。这些援助不仅帮助我们巩固了我们的胜利，保卫了我们的胜利果实；并且帮助我们创造了一切有利条件，为及早完成新民主主义建设，走向社会主义建设和共产主义建设的远大前途打下良好基础。
    三年来，苏联在外交上和反对帝国主义的国际斗争中，也不断地大力援助了我们。一九五○年二月十四日中苏两国缔结了“中苏友好同盟互助条约”，这个盟约的签订，一方面更加巩固和发展了中苏两国的牢不可破的友谊，另一方面大大提高了我国国际地位，加强了我国安全的保障。美帝国主义者在朝鲜战场遭到可耻的失败之后，一直在叫嚣着要扩大朝鲜战争。但是他们始终不敢贸然发动对于我国全面的武装侵略。其原因就是恐惧中苏友好同盟的强大。
    三年来苏联对于我国经济建设也给了巨大的援助，苏联给予我国以三亿美元的巨额贷款，使我国在解放之后建国之始，能立即得到经济建设上所急需的各种机器设备与器材，能迅速恢复和发展我国的工业生产和农业生产，从而增加了国家的财富，改善了人民的生活。当美帝国主义者对我国实行“封锁”和“禁运”的时候，由于我们两国签订了贸易协定及交换货物协定，我国在对外贸易上不但未受到任何影响和困难，反而大大发展，并且出现了七十三年来所未有的出超情况。这不能不使帝国主义者大吃一惊，叫苦连天，因为它已自食其“封锁”和“禁运”的恶果了。
    此外，苏联技术上的援助对于我国建设，也起了很大的作用。三年来苏联专家帮助我们解决了经济建设中的许多困难问题，加速了我国经济建设的速度，并帮助我们建立起崭新的现代化工厂企业，同时还帮助我们培养了大批掌握先进技术的建设人材。这一切充分表明了苏联人民的高贵的友情。中国人民是永远不会忘记这种友情的。
    在文化建设上，苏联对于我们的援助也产生了极大的成效。三年来，苏联应我们方面的邀请先后派了许多学者、专家前来我国讲学，向我国人民介绍苏联社会主义建设的理论和实践以及苏联的先进学术思想；在教育制度、教学内容、教学方法上，也介绍了许多先进经验。在苏联专家的帮助下，我们创立了完全新型的中国人民大学。学校的教育方针就是“苏联经验与中国情况相结合”。可以说，三年来我国文化教育事业的进步是惊人的，基本上执行了毛主席所指示的新民主主义文化教育政策。这些进步与发展是与苏联学者专家的帮助分不开的。
    我们伟大的祖国即将进行大规模的经济建设和文化建设，全国人民也都在准备着迎接这一巨大建设的高潮，事实告诉我们，学习苏联的先进建设经验是我国建设胜利的保证。正如刘少奇副主席所说：“我们中国人民的革命，在过去就是学习苏联，‘以俄为师’，所以能够获得今天这样的胜利。在今后我们要建国，同样也必须‘以俄为师’，学习苏联人民的建国经验。”三年来我们学习了苏联的先进建设经验，所以无论在工业生产上或农业生产上，都收到了巨大的效果，获得了惊人的成绩；今后我们更要克服保守思想进一步地学习苏联的先进经验，这样才能保证我们的伟大建设任务的完成。苏联人民业已胜利地完成了社会主义建设，现正向共产主义社会前进。我们只有向苏联人民学习，学习他们忘我的劳动的精神，学习他们的一切先进经验，学习他们的爱国主义与国际主义相结合的伟大精神；我们才能保证胜利地进行新民主主义建设，把我们伟大的祖国建成一个独立、民主、和平、统一和富强的国家。
    解放后的中国人民从自己的革命斗争与胜利过程中，更能认识到苏联对于中国人民的援助，无论过去、现在和将来都是至公无私、正大光明的。这不仅可从过去铁一般的事实中得到证明，而且从苏联这一伟大盟邦立国的精神上以及它对外所采取的
    “平等、互利、互相尊重国家主权与领土完整及不干涉对方内政”的外交政策方面可以看得很清楚。我们深刻地了解到苏联是一个无产阶级专政的社会主义国家，它已经消灭了资本主义和剥削阶级，即是说它已消灭了一切剥削和奴役的思想根源。所以，苏联对于我们的援助，必然是也只能是以无产阶级的大公无私的和爱国主义与国际主义相结合的伟大精神来进行的。这和过去美帝国主义者的所谓“援华”其名侵略其实的行为，无论在内容上和方法上是绝无相同之处的。中国人民眼睛是雪亮的，头脑是清醒的，对于朋友的至诚无私的援助，是极力的欢迎和衷心的感激；对于帝国主义的所谓“援华”，假仁假义口蜜腹剑式的“援助”，是深恶痛绝、极端反对的。毛主席已明确地指示我们：“我们在国际上是属于以苏联为首的反帝国主义战线一方面的，真正的友谊的援助只能向这一方面去找，而不能向帝国主义战线一方面去找。”这对于全国人民是一个重要的启发、学习的方向和努力的依据。
    兹当苏联伟大的十月社会主义革命胜利三十五周年之际，我们回想光荣的过去，瞻望胜利的将来，使我们更加认识到对于这一伟大光荣纪念日欢呼庆祝的重要意义。斯大林大元帅最近在联共第十九次代表大会上的演说中曾这样亲切地指出：“我们的党和我们的国家，过去始终需要，而且将来仍然需要国外兄弟人民的信任、同情和支持，……自然，我们的党不能不报答兄弟党。它必须也给它们以支持，同时必须给它们的人民争取解放的斗争、它们的人民维护和平的斗争以支持。”“产生这种互相支持的特点是因为：我们党的利益和爱好和平的各国人民的利益不但没有矛盾，而且是融合在一起的。”让我们本着中苏两国人民亲密友爱团结互助的精神，加强向伟大的苏联人民的学习，加强中苏两国人民兄弟般亲密无间的友谊，加强以苏联为首的和平民主阵营。共同打倒战争制造者，共同为争取全世界的持久和平和人民民主而奋斗。
