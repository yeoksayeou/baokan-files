The basic economic law of modern capitalism

Soviet Union Lubinstein

"The main features and requirements of the basic economic law of modern capitalism can be roughly expressed as follows: to ensure maximum capitalist profits by exploiting the majority of the people in one's own country and bankrupting and impoverishing them, by enslaving and constantly plundering the people of other countries, especially the people of backward countries, and by using wars and militarization of the national economy aimed at ensuring maximum profits."
—Stalin: "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR"

(I)

The working people of the world are greeting the thirty-fifth anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution with extreme excitement. The October Revolution opened a new era in human history—the era of the demise of capitalism and the victory of socialism.

The Soviet people, who have built socialism and are confidently moving towards communism, have been able to achieve world-historic victories because they are led by the great Lenin-Stalin Party, armed with the invincible doctrine of Marxism-Leninism.

The entire course of historical development is a clear demonstration of the victory of Marxist-Leninist thought. Comrade Stalin creatively developed and enriched the doctrine of Marxism-Leninism, illuminating the path of struggle and victory for the working people of the world against capitalist enslavement and for peace, democracy, and socialism with his brilliant works.

Comrade Stalin's classic work "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR" is an advanced stage in the development of Marxist-Leninist political economy and has great significance for the development of revolutionary theory and revolutionary practice.

Comrade Stalin's revelation of the basic economic law of modern capitalism and the basic economic law of socialism is an outstanding contribution to political economy.

Comrade Stalin pointed out that the basic economic law of capitalism is a law that does not determine a certain individual aspect or certain individual processes of capitalist production development, but determines all the main aspects and all the main processes of capitalist production development, and thus determines the essence of capitalist production and the nature of capitalist production.

Comrade Stalin scientifically proved that the basic economic law of modern capitalism is the law of maximum profit, and its main features and requirements are:

"To ensure maximum capitalist profits by exploiting the majority of the people in one's own country and bankrupting and impoverishing them, by enslaving and constantly plundering the people of other countries, especially the people of backward countries, and by using wars and militarization of the national economy aimed at ensuring maximum profits."

Marx was the first to give a scientific explanation of the generation of capitalist profit, analyzing that it is produced by surplus value, by the unpaid labor of workers, and the entire capitalist social system exists by relying on the unpaid labor of workers.

Marx pointed out that the pursuit of profit is the purpose of capitalist production, and as for consumption, it is only needed for capitalism if it ensures the completion of the task of obtaining profit. "The rate of profit," Marx wrote, "is the driving force of capitalist production; only things that can generate profit are produced." After Marx revealed the law of surplus value, that is, the law of the generation and increase of capitalist profit that determines the main characteristics of capitalist production, he solved the problem of the formation of the average rate of profit and discovered the laws and trends governing changes in the rate of profit.

After capitalism entered the era of imperialism, the economic conditions of capitalist development were fundamentally changed. This caused the laws of capitalist economics to take on other forms. As early as 1927, Comrade Stalin pointed out that the laws of capitalist development, unlike the sociological laws related to all stages of social development, are able to change and should change.

At various stages of capitalist development, their effects are restricted or strengthened according to changing conditions. Lenin and Stalin developed Marxism in their brilliant works, profoundly and comprehensively studying the changes in the economic conditions of capitalism during the period of imperialism and the general crisis of the world capitalist system. They pointed out that in the era of imperialism, when capitalism began to develop along a downward line, all the contradictions of the capitalist mode of production were sharply intensified. The basic contradiction of capitalism—the contradiction between the social nature of production and the capitalist form of ownership of the means of production—became unprecedentedly tense. Comrade Stalin said in his report to the Sixteenth Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) in 1930:

"The enormous growth of capitalist productive forces, aimed at obtaining the maximum capitalist profit, and the relative reduction of the purchasing power of millions of working masses—whose living standards the capitalists are constantly trying to limit to the minimum—is a manifestation of this basic contradiction." (Stalin's Collected Works, Volume 12, pp. 243-244)

The intensification of the basic contradiction of capitalism is particularly powerfully manifested during the general crisis of the world capitalist system. Under such conditions, the speed of expanded reproduction in major capitalist countries has greatly slowed down, and even simple reproduction cannot be realized during the more lasting periods of economic crisis of overproduction.

As Comrade Stalin pointed out, modern monopoly capitalism cannot be satisfied with average profit, which is the minimum profit below which capitalist production cannot be carried out. Even superprofits, which are usually slightly higher than the average profit, cannot guarantee that modern monopoly capitalism can achieve a fairly regular expanded reproduction. What is necessary for the realization of fairly regular expanded reproduction is not average profit, not superprofit, but maximum profit, which is the driving force of monopoly capitalism.

With the changes in conditions in the new stage of capitalist development, the laws of capitalism have also changed. Comrade Stalin pointed out in his work "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR" that the law of surplus value, that is, the law of the generation and increase of capitalist profit, is too general for the period of monopoly capitalism, and it does not involve the issue of maximum profit. Comrade Stalin wrote:

"To make up for this deficiency, it is necessary to specify the law of surplus value, to develop it to adapt to the conditions of monopoly capitalism, while taking into account that what monopoly capitalism requires is not just any profit, but precisely the maximum profit. This will be the basic economic law of modern capitalism."

For the giants of monopoly capitalism, the necessity of obtaining maximum profit is more acute in the second stage of the general crisis of the world capitalist system, which began during World War II, especially after the people's democracies in Europe and Asia broke away from the capitalist system. At this time, the market problem has been acutely sharpened.

The most important consequence in the economic aspect of World War II and its economic impact, Comrade Stalin taught, is the collapse of the unified and all-encompassing world market:

"...China and other European people's democracies have broken away from the capitalist system and, together with the Soviet Union, have formed a unified and powerful socialist camp, which is opposed to the capitalist camp. The economic consequence of the existence of two opposing camps is the disintegration of the unified and all-encompassing world market, so that there are now two parallel and mutually opposed world markets."

After the disintegration of the world market, the scope of major capitalist countries (the United States, Britain, and France) to seize world resources has been reduced. Therefore, as Comrade Stalin pointed out, the growth of production in major capitalist countries will be carried out on a reduced basis, because the scale of production in these countries will be reduced.

The necessity of obtaining maximum profit prompts monopoly capitalism to take such risky steps as enslaving and constantly plundering colonies and other backward countries, turning many independent countries into vassal states, organizing new wars (in the eyes of the giants of modern capitalism, war is the best "deal" for obtaining maximum profit), and attempting to seize world hegemony.

(II)

In his work "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR," Comrade Stalin profoundly elucidated the difference between the production goals of capitalism and socialism and the means of achieving these goals.

Under socialism, the purpose of production is not profit, but people and their needs, that is, to ensure the maximum satisfaction of the constantly growing material and cultural needs of the entire society by means of the continuous growth and improvement of socialist production on a highly technical basis.

In contrast, the purpose of capitalist production is to ensure maximum profit. Strengthening the exploitation of the majority of the people in one's own country and bankrupting and impoverishing them is one of the important means of achieving this goal.

Capitalists exhaust every method to strengthen the exploitation of the working class, raising the rate of surplus value by reducing real wages and frantically intensifying labor intensity.

The effect of the basic economic law of modern capitalism is to increasingly strengthen the absolute and relative impoverishment of the working class. The share of the national income received by the working class is declining, and the real wages of workers are constantly being reduced. For example, in France and Italy, the real wages of workers in 1952 were less than half of those before the war. In Britain, the real wages of workers in 1952 were 20% lower than before the war. According to materials from the Electrical Workers' Union, the cost of living in the United States has almost doubled compared to 1939. A particularly important factor in the intensification of the impoverishment of the working class is the existence of a huge army of millions of unemployed workers. Not only do the unemployed suffer because of unemployment, but employed workers also suffer because of the existence of unemployment. The existence of a large number of unemployed workers creates an unstable position for workers in production, that is, anxiety about tomorrow.

During the post-war period, mass, long-term unemployment has greatly increased. Currently, there are more than two million fully unemployed workers and a large number of partially unemployed workers in Italy. West Germany has nearly three million fully unemployed workers and partially unemployed workers. Japan has about ten million fully unemployed workers and partially unemployed workers. The United States has no less than three million fully unemployed workers and ten million partially unemployed workers.

In order to pursue maximum profits, American monopoly capitalists strengthen the exploitation of the working class, throwing millions of workers into the ranks of the unemployed army, while also bankrupting a large number of peasants and urban petty bourgeoisie.

One of the important methods adopted by financial oligarchs to obtain maximum profits by plundering and bankrupting the majority of the people is monopoly prices. Monopoly prices further greatly reduce the purchasing power of the vast majority of the people. Capitalists use monopoly prices to strengthen the exploitation and plunder of working people, not only exploiting and plundering producers, but also exploiting and plundering consumers of the goods they produce.

Lenin wrote that monopoly prices are one of the main reasons for the parasitism and decay of monopoly capitalism:

"Since monopoly prices are formed (though only temporarily), the reasons for promoting technological progress, that is, promoting all other progress (that is, forward movement), disappear to some extent; thus, the economic possibility of artificially hindering technological progress also appears." (Lenin's Collected Works, Volume 22, p. 263)

Comrade Stalin further developed the Marxist-Leninist theory, pointing out that the astonishing contradictions in technological development under capitalism can only be explained by the basic economic law of modern capitalism, that is, by the necessity of obtaining maximum profit:

"When new technology promises maximum profit to capitalism, capitalism supports new technology. When new technology no longer promises maximum profit, capitalism opposes new technology and advocates a return to manual labor."

Due to unprecedented increases in taxes, rising prices of daily necessities, and inflation, the relative and absolute impoverishment of the working people of capitalist countries has been sharply intensified.

The state finances of imperialist countries, that is, their entire financial and credit-monetary system, are tools used to ensure that monopoly capitalists obtain maximum profits by means of the brutal exploitation and plunder of working people within the scope of circulation. The direct taxes of residents in the United States current budget year have increased elevenfold compared to the 1937-1938 budget year (even calculated with currency devaluation). In addition, the broad masses of working people are also heavily burdened with huge indirect taxes.

The strengthening of the exploitation of the working class and the bankruptcy and impoverishment of the majority of the people in capitalist countries brought about for the sake of the maximum profit of a small handful of monopoly capitalists inevitably lead to a sharp intensification of class contradictions. The contradictions between the imperialist bourgeoisie and the working class and other working people are sharply intensified. The workers' strike movement has a broader scale. The enormous upsurge of the world communist movement in the post-war period is completely lawful.

In capitalist society, people are subject to the cold and ruthless law of obtaining maximum profit, and thus working people suffer from poverty, hunger, unemployment, and profound suffering.

The effect of the basic economic law of socialism is fundamentally the opposite. Comrade Stalin pointed out that under the socialist system, "it is not to ensure the maximum profit, but to ensure the maximum satisfaction of the material and cultural needs of society; not the development of production with intermittent states from upsurge to crisis and from crisis to upsurge, but the continuous growth of production; not periodic intermittent states in technological development accompanied by the destruction of social productive forces, but the continuous improvement of production on a highly technical basis."

Socialism guarantees that working people live a rich and civilized life.

(III)

While strengthening the exploitation of the majority of the people in their own countries, monopoly capital also ensures maximum profit by enslaving and constantly plundering the people of other countries, especially the people of backward countries. Capital export is an important source of huge profits for financial oligarchs.

Lenin called capital export "double parasitism," which enables financial capital to spread nets in all countries and obtain huge income from exploiting hundreds of millions of residents in colonies and vassal states.

During the general crisis of the world capitalist system, the United States is the main capital exporter and thus also the main financial exploiter of the entire capitalist world. The private foreign investment of American monopoly capitalists and bankers alone exceeds the foreign investment of all imperialist countries combined. The total income of American monopoly capitalists from exploiting other countries—including profits obtained from foreign investment and unequal exchange with vassal states—is estimated by the progressive economist Perroux to be US$7.5 billion in 1948. These huge profits of American monopoly capitalists are one of the main reasons for the poverty, hunger, and death of the masses of people in backward countries under the shackles of American imperialism.

The ever-growing national debt and credit, such as the "Marshall Plan," military aid plan, and "Truman Point Four Program," also bring huge profits to American monopoly capitalists. These debts and credits have a military-police nature, with the aim of assisting reactionary forces and fascist forces around the world.

In order to satisfy the wishes of monopoly capitalists, the US government has adopted all means to ensure the maximum profits of monopoly giants by means of enslaving and plundering other countries. This policy of American imperialism has had a destructive impact on the economies of Western Europe and other countries in the capitalist world. In order to pursue maximum profits, American monopoly capitalists have seized a large part of the world capitalist market, disintegrating the economies of other capitalist countries and destroying the historically formed economic links between these countries.

Due to the effect of the basic economic law of modern capitalism, the contradictions between the United States and other capitalist countries have been sharply intensified. The monopoly capitalists of these countries cannot tolerate the current situation indefinitely. Currently, the expansion of American monopoly capital occupies their markets and colonial raw material sources, thus endangering their high profits from collapsing.

American monopoly capitalists and British monopoly capitalists have engaged in a brutal struggle for the market for commodity sales and cheap raw materials (especially oil, rubber, non-ferrous metals, and rare metals) in order to pursue maximum profits. As Comrade Malenkov pointed out at the Nineteenth Party Congress, "Britain and France and other capitalist countries following Britain are striving to get rid of dependence on the United States in order to achieve independent status and high profits."

The predatory exploitation of backward countries by imperialist powers, the slow development of productive forces, the bankruptcy of hundreds of millions of people, and the reduction of sales markets have further strengthened the contradictions of the world capitalist system. The scale of the national liberation movement in colonies and vassal states is expanding year by year, and the people of these countries are increasingly firmly resisting imperialist enslavers. The struggles being waged by the people of Vietnam, Burma, Malaya, the Philippines, and Indonesia, and the growth of the national resistance movement in India, Iran, Egypt, and other countries, can prove that the scale of the national liberation movement is expanding. Due to the new upsurge of wars and national liberation struggles in colonies and vassal states, the imperialist colonial system is actually disintegrating.

Therefore, the basic economic law of modern capitalism makes the contradictions of the world capitalist system extremely acute. In order to pursue maximum profits, American monopoly capital attempts to conquer the world by military force and attempts to launch a new world war.

Unlike the imperialist camp divided by contradictions, the economic cooperation of friendship between countries in the socialist camp is becoming increasingly consolidated. The Soviet Union and the people's democracies are closely united economically, establishing economic cooperation and mutual assistance. Mutual assistance and the sincere desire to achieve universal economic upsurge are the foundation of this cooperation.

(IV)

Lenin and Stalin pointed out that imperialism inevitably generates war, and modern militarism is a direct result of capitalist development to the stage of monopoly. War and the militarization of the national economy are one of the most important means for monopoly capital to ensure maximum profit.

Comrade Stalin pointed out that war is the biggest income for imperialists, so imperialist agents always strive to instigate war in one way or another.

US, British, and French imperialists have exhausted all means to instigate war hysteria against the democratic camp, putting the economy on a war track, hoping to ensure maximum profit by means of military orders and military supplies. The war of aggression in Korea and the fanatical preparation for a new world war truly guarantee unprecedented profits for monopoly capitalists. Even according to official and obviously reduced statistics, the profits of American monopoly capitalists grew from US$3.3 billion in 1938 to US$42.9 billion in 1951, an increase of twelvefold.

The monopolized merchants of death are making fortunes by means of war destruction, by means of the despicable bombing of peaceful cities and villages in Korea, by means of bacteriological warfare, and other anti-human crimes.

In an attempt to maintain and further expand military profits, US imperialists have established military aggression blocs, turning West Germany and Japan into military strategic bases against peace-loving people.

Many American economists—the ideologues of American monopoly capital—fantasize that the military economy can exist forever and that a continuous succession of wars can maintain the mythical profits of military industrial monopolists. The economics magazine of monopoly capitalists, "Fortune," nakedly expressed this cannibalistic desire. The magazine advocates the policy of unlimited wars, one after another, within ten years or even during an entire generation. This policy is repeated and developed in various tones by the ideologues of American imperialism.

Answering this growing threat of war is the development of the nationwide movement to maintain peace in countries around the world. The hatred and resistance of the various peoples oppressed by US imperialism against US imperialism—the world's gendarme—is surging. The strength of peace supporters has been consolidated and organized, constantly exposing those who instigate war.

The opposition between the effect of the basic economic law of modern capitalism and the effect of the basic economic law of socialism determines two opposite lines of economic development. The economic line of modern capitalism leads to the stagnation of productive forces, leads to the deepening of the general crisis of the world capitalist system and the recurrence of economic crises of overproduction, and leads to a deformed and one-sided war economy. This war economy destroys productive forces and kills people.

The economic line of the socialist and democratic camp, headed by the Soviet Union, is a line of peaceful economic development. It knows no crises or unemployment and guarantees the gradual improvement of the material and cultural level of the people.

The basic economic law of modern capitalism explains the reasons for the aggressive and predatory policies of imperialist countries, and explains the reasons for the growth of contradictions between imperialist countries. The effect of this law deepens the general crisis of capitalism and inevitably causes all the contradictions of capitalist society to grow and erupt.

The basic economic law of modern capitalism and the basic economic law of socialism prove that the capitalist system has lived past its time and that it should give way to the new, more advanced socialist system.

The great victories achieved by our people under the leadership of the Lenin-Stalin Party during the thirty-five years of the existence of Soviet power extremely clearly demonstrate the decisive superiority of socialism over capitalism.

    现代资本主义的基本经济法则
    苏联  鲁宾斯坦
    “现代资本主义基本经济法则的主要特点和要求，可以大致表述如下：用剥削本国大多数居民并使他们破产和贫困的办法，用奴役和不断掠夺其他国家人民、特别是落后国家人民的办法，以及用旨在保证最高利润的战争和国民经济军事化的办法，来保证最大限度的资本主义利润。”
    ——斯大林：“苏联社会主义经济问题”
    （一）
    全世界劳动人民正在怀着极端兴奋的心情迎接伟大的十月社会主义革命的三十五周年，十月革命开辟了人类历史的新时代——资本主义灭亡、社会主义胜利的时代。
    建成了社会主义并正满怀信心地走向共产主义的苏联人民所以能够取得全世界历史性的胜利，是因为它是由用无往而不胜的马克思—列宁主义的学说武装着的伟大的列宁—斯大林党领导着的。
    历史发展的全部进程是马克思—列宁主义思想的胜利的显明证明。斯大林同志创造性地发展和丰富了马克思—列宁主义的学说，用他的天才著作照耀着全世界劳动人民反对资本主义奴役制度、争取和平、民主和社会主义的胜利的斗争和胜利的道路。
    斯大林同志的经典性的著作“苏联社会主义经济问题”，是马克思—列宁主义政治经济学发展中的高级阶段，对于革命理论和革命实践的发展有着重大的意义。
    斯大林同志对于现代资本主义基本经济法则和社会主义基本经济法则的揭示，是对政治经济学的杰出的贡献。
    斯大林同志指出，资本主义的基本经济法则是这样一种法则，它不是决定资本主义生产发展的某一个别方面或某些个别过程，而是决定资本主义生产发展的一切主要方面和一切主要过程，因而是决定资本主义生产的实质，决定资本主义生产的本质的。
    斯大林同志科学地证明了：现代资本主义的基本经济法则是最大限度利润的法则，它的主要特点和要求是：
    “用剥削本国大多数居民并使他们破产和贫困的办法，用奴役和不断掠夺其他国家人民、特别是落后国家人民的办法，以及用旨在保证最高利润的战争和国民经济军事化的办法，来保证最大限度的资本主义利润。”
    马克思第一次地给予了资本主义利润的产生以科学的说明，分析它是靠剩余价值、靠工人的无偿劳动而产生的，整个资本主义社会制度就是依赖着工人的无偿劳动而存在的。
    马克思指出，追求利润是资本主义生产的目的，至于消费，只有在保证完成取得利润这一任务的情形下，才对于资本主义是需要的。“利润率，——马克思写道，——是资本主义生产的动力；只有那些能够产生利润的东西，才被生产。”马克思在揭发了剩余价值法则，即决定资本主义生产的主要特征的资本主义利润产生和增殖的法则以后，解决了关于平均利润率的形成问题，发现了支配利润率的变化的诸法则和趋势。
    资本主义进入帝国主义时代以后，根本改变了资
    本主义发展的经济条件。这使得资本主义经济的诸法则采取了另外的形态。斯大林同志还在一九二七年就曾指出说，资本主义发展的诸法则，不同于和社会发展的一切阶段有关的社会学的诸法则，——它们能够变化而且应该变化。
    在资本主义发展的各个阶段上，它们的作用根据变化着的条件而受到限制或被加强。列宁和斯大林在他们的天才著作中发展了马克思主义，深刻而全面地研究了帝国主义和世界资本主义体系总危机时期的资本主义的经济条件的变化。他们指出，在帝国主义时代，当资本主义开始循着下降线发展时，资本主义生产方式的一切矛盾急剧地尖锐化起来。资本主义的基本矛盾——生产的社会性和生产品的资本主义占有形式间的矛盾变得空前紧张。斯大林同志在一九三○年联共（布）党第十六次代表大会上的报告中说：
    “旨在获得最大限度的资本主义利润的资本主义生产能力的巨大增长，和数百万劳动群众——资本家时时在努力把他们的生活水平限制在最低限度上——购买力所及的需求的相对的缩减，是这种基本矛盾的表现。”（斯大林全集第十二卷，第二四三—二四四页）
    资本主义基本矛盾的尖锐化在世界资本主义体系总危机时期特别有力地表现出来。在这样的条件下，主要资本主义国家的扩大再生产的速度大为减缓，而在生产过剩的经济危机更持久的期间内，甚至连简单再生产也不能实现。
    如斯大林同志所指出的，现代的垄断资本主义不能满足于平均利润，平均利润是最低限度的利润，再低于它就不可能进行资本主义生产。甚至通常比平均利润稍高一些的超额利润，也不能保证现代的垄断资本主义能够实现相当经常的扩大再生产。为实现相当经常的扩大再生产所必需的不是平均利润，不是超额利润，而是最大限度的利润，最大限度的利润是垄断资本主义的动力。
    随着资本主义发展的新的阶段上的条件的变化，资本主义的诸法则也改变了。斯大林同志在其著作“苏联社会主义经济问题”中指出，剩余价值法则，即资本主义利润产生和增殖的法则，对于垄断资本主义时期来说，是过于一般的法则，它没有涉及最高利润的问题。斯大林同志写道：
    “要弥补这个缺陷，就必须把剩余价值法则具体化，把它发展起来适应于垄断资本主义的条件，同时要考虑到，垄断资本主义所要求的不是随便什么利润，而正是最大限度的利润。这才会是现代资本主义的基本经济法则。”
    对于垄断资本主义的巨头们来说，获得最大限度的利润的必要性，在世界资本主义体系总危机的第二阶段更为尖锐，世界资本主义体系总危机的第二阶段是在第二次大战时期、特别是在欧洲和亚洲各人民民主国家脱离了资本主义体系以后开始的，这时，市场问题急剧尖锐化。
    第二次世界大战及其经济影响在经济方面的最重要的结果，斯大林同志教导说，是统一的无所不包的世界市场的瓦解：
    “……中国和其他欧洲各人民民主国家却脱离了资本主义体系，和苏联一起形成了统一的和强大的社会主义阵营，而与资本主义阵营相对立。两个对立阵营存在之经济结果，就是统一的无所不包的世界市场瓦解了，因而现在就有了两个平行的也是互相对立的世界市场。”
    在世界市场瓦解以后，各主要资本主义国家（美、英、法）攫取世界资源的范围缩小了。因此，如斯大林同志指出的，各主要资本主义国家的生产的增长，将在缩小了的基础上进行，因为这些国家的生产规模将会缩小。
    获取最大限度的利润的必要性，促使垄断资本主义采取这样一些冒险的步骤，如同奴役和不断掠夺殖民地及其他落后的国家，把许多独立国变为附属国，组织新的战争（在现代资本主义的巨头们看来，战争是取得最大限度利润的最好的“买卖”），以及试图夺取世界霸权。
    （二）
    斯大林同志在“苏联社会主义经济问题”一著作中深刻地阐明了资本主义和社会主义的生产目的及达到这些目的的手段的区别。
    在社会主义条件下，生产的目的不是利润，而是人及其需要，即用在高度技术基础上使社会主义生产不断增长和不断完善的办法，来保证最大限度地满足整个社会经常增长的物质和文化的需要。
    与此相反，资本主义生产的目的是保证最大限度的利润。加强对本国大多数居民的剥削并使他们破产和贫困，是达到这一目的的重要手段之一。
    资本家们用尽一切方法加强对工人阶级的剥削，用减低实际工资和疯狂地加强劳动强度的办法提高剩余价值率。
    现代资本主义基本经济法则的作用，使工人阶级的绝对的和相对的贫困化日益加强。工人阶级从国民收入中所得到的份额在下降着，职工的实际工资不断减低。例如，在法国和意大利，一九五二年工人的实际工资不及战前的一半，在英国，一九五二年工人的实际工资比战前降低了百分之二十。根据电气工人工会的材料，美国的生活费比一九三九年几乎提高了两倍。工人阶级的贫困化加强的特别重要的因素是数百万失业工人大军的存在。不仅失业的人因为失业而遭受到痛苦，有工作的工人也因为失业之存在而遭受痛苦。大量失业工人之存在，造成了工人在生产中的不稳定的地位，即对明日的忧虑。
    在战后期间，群众性的、长期的失业大大增加。现在，意大利有二百万以上完全失业工人和大量部分失业工人；西德有将近三百万完全失业工人和部分失业工人，日本约有一千万完全失业工人和部分失业工人。美国有不下三百万完全失业工人和一千万部分失业工人。
    美国垄断资本家为了追逐最大限度的利润，便加强对工人阶级的剥削，把数百万工人抛掷在失业大军的队伍中，同时，还使众多的农民和城市小资产阶级破产。
    财政寡头们所采用的通过掠夺大多数居民使他们破产以便取得最大限度的利润的重要方法之一，是垄断价格。垄断价格使绝大多数居民购买力所及的需求更为大大地缩减。资本家运用垄断价格加强了对劳动人民的剥削与掠夺，不仅是对生产者加以剥削和掠夺，而且对他们制造出来的商品的消费者也加以剥削和掠夺。
    列宁写道，垄断价格是垄断资本主义的寄生性和腐朽的主要原因之一：
    “既然垄断价格形成（虽然只是暂时的），于是推动技术进步、亦即推动其他一切进步（即前进的运动）的原因，就在某种程度上消失下去；于是也就出现了人为地阻碍技术进步的经济上的可能性。”（列宁全集第二十二卷，第二六三页）
    斯大林同志进一步发展了马克思—列宁主义的理论，他指出，在资本主义条件下技术发展中的惊人的矛盾，只有用现代资本主义的基本经济法则，即用取得最大利润的必需性，才能加以说明：
    “当新技术向资本主义预示着最大利润的时候，资本主义就拥护新技术。当新技术不再预示着最大利润的时候，资本主义就反对新技术，主张转而采用手工劳动。”
    由于税收的空前增加、日用必需品价格的增长以及通货膨胀，资本主义国家劳动人民的相对的和绝对的贫穷化急剧加强。
    帝国主义国家的国家财政，即它们的整个财政和信贷——货币制度，是用在流通范围内残酷剥削和掠夺劳动人民的办法来保证垄断资本家取得最大限度利润的工具。美国本预算年度居民的直接税比一九三七——一九三八预算年度增长了十一倍（连货币的贬值计算在内）。此外，广大劳动人民还沉重地负担着巨额的间接税。
    对工人阶级的剥削的加强，和为了一小撮垄断资本家的最大限度利润而招来的资本主义国家大多数居民的破产和贫困，必不可免地会使阶级矛盾急剧加强。帝国主义资产阶级和工人阶级及其他劳动人民间的矛盾急剧尖锐化。工人的罢工运动具有更广泛的规模。战后时期世界共产主义运动的巨大高涨是完全合乎规律的。
    在资本主义社会里，人服从于取得最大限度利润的冷酷无情的法则，因之，劳动人民遭受着贫困、饥饿、失业和深重的苦难。
    社会主义基本经济法则的作用则根本相反。斯大林同志指出说：在社会主义制度下，“不是保证最大限度的利润，而是保证最大限度地满足社会的物质和文化的需要；不是带有从高涨到危机以及从危机到高涨的间歇状态的生产发展，而是生产的不断增长；不是伴随着社会生产力的破坏而来的技术发展中的周期性的间歇状态，而是生产在高度技术基础上不断完善。”
    社会主义保证劳动人民过着富裕的、文明的生活。
    （三）
    与加强对本国大多数居民的剥削同时，垄断资本还用奴役和不断掠夺其他国家人民、特别是落后国家人民的办法来保证最大限度的利润。资本输出是财政寡头们的巨额利润的重要泉源。
    列宁把资本输出称做“双重的寄生性”，它使财政资本能够在一切国家布下网，从剥削殖民地和附属国的数亿居民中获得巨大的收入。
    在世界资本主义体系总危机时期，美国是主要的资本输出者，因而也是整个资本主义世界主要的财政剥削者。仅美国垄断资本家和银行家的私人国外投资，便超过了一切帝国主义国家计算在一起的国外投资额。美国垄断资本家剥削其他国家的总收入——包括国外投资和与附属国的不等价交换而得到的利润，据进步的经济学家皮尔劳的概算，在一九四八年为七十五亿美元。美国垄断资本家的这些巨额利润，是在美国帝国主义羁绊下的落后国家人民大众贫穷、饥饿和死亡的主要原因之一。
    一年年增长着的国家公债和信贷，如“马歇尔计划”、军事援助计划、“杜鲁门第四点计划”等，也给美国垄断资本家带来了巨额利润。这些公债和信贷具有军事——警察的性质，以援助全世界的反动势力和法西斯主义势力为其目的。
    为了满足垄断资本家的愿望，美国政府采用了一切手段以便通过奴役和掠夺其他国家的办法来保证垄断资本巨头们的最大限度的利润。美国帝国主义的这种政策，使西欧和资本主义世界其他国家的经济遭受到破坏性的影响。美国垄断资本家为了追逐最大限度的利润，夺取了世界资本主义市场的一大部分，使其他资本主义国家的经济瓦解，破坏了这些国家间历史上形成的经济联系。
    由于现代资本主义基本经济法则的作用，美国和其他资本主义国家间的矛盾急剧加强，这些国家的垄断资本家不能无止境地容忍当前的局势，现在，美国垄断资本的扩张占据了他们的市场和殖民地原料来源，因而，使他们的高额利润面临着破灭的危险。
    美国垄断资本家和英国垄断资本家为了追逐最大限度的利润，进行了争取商品销售市场和廉价原料
    （特别是石油、橡胶、有色金属和稀有金属等）来源的残酷斗争。如马林科夫同志在第十九次党代表大会上指出的，“英国及跟在英国后面的法国和其他资本主义国家正在努力摆脱对美国的依附以便取得独立的地位和高额的利润”。
    帝国主义强国对落后国家的掠夺性的剥削、生产力的迟滞的发展、数亿人民的破产和销售市场的缩小，更加强了世界资本主义体系的矛盾。殖民地和附属国的民族解放运动的规模在逐年扩大着，这些国家的人民日益坚决地反抗帝国主义奴役者。越南、缅甸、马来亚、菲律宾和印度尼西亚人民正在进行的斗争，印度、伊朗、埃及和其他国家的民族抵抗运动的增长，可以证明民族解放运动规模正在扩大。由于战争和殖民地及附属国民族解放斗争的新的高涨，帝国主义的殖民体系实际上已在解体中。
    所以，现代资本主义的基本经济法则，使世界资本主义体系的矛盾极端尖锐化。为了追逐最大限度的利润，美国垄断资本企图用军事力量征服全球，企图发动新的世界战争。
    与被矛盾分裂着的帝国主义阵营不同，社会主义阵营各国间友谊的经济合作日趋巩固。苏联和各人民民主国家在经济上紧密团结起来，建立了经济上的合作与互助。互相帮助和达到普遍的经济高涨的真诚愿望，是这种合作的基础。

    列宁和斯大林指出，帝国主义必然产生战争，现代的军国主义是资本主义发展到垄断阶段的直接结果。战争和国民经济军事化是垄断资本保证取得最大限度利润的最重要手段之一。
    斯大林同志指出说，战争对于帝国主义者是一项最大的收入，所以，帝国主义的代理人总是努力这样或那样地挑拨战争。
    美、英、法帝国主义者用尽一切办法煽起了反对民主阵营的战争歇斯底里，把经济转上战争轨道，希望靠军事定货和军事供给保证最大限度的利润。在朝鲜的侵略战争和对新的世界战争的狂热准备，真正保证了垄断资本家的空前的利润。甚至根据官方显然缩小了的统计，美国垄断资本家的利润由一九三八年的三十三亿美元增长到一九五一年的四百二十九亿美元，即增长了十二倍。
    垄断的贩卖死亡的商人靠战争的破坏，靠对朝鲜和平城市和乡村的卑鄙的轰炸，靠细菌战及其他反人类的罪行来发财。
    美国帝国主义者企图保持和更加扩大军事利润，建立了军事侵略集团，把西德和日本变为反对爱好和平的人民的军事战略基地。
    许多美国经济学者——美国垄断资本的思想家，幻想着能使军事经济永存和保持军事工业垄断者的神话般的利润的一个接连一个不断的战争。垄断资本家的经济学杂志“幸福”露骨地表现了这种吃人的渴望，该杂志宣传在十年内或者甚至在整整这一代期间内一个接着一个的无限战争的方针。这种方针被美国帝国主义的思想家们用各种声调重复着和发展着。
    回答这一日益增长着的战争威胁的，是世界各国维护和平的全民运动的开展。受美国帝国主义压迫的各族人民仇恨和反抗美帝国主义——这个世界的宪兵——的浪潮在高涨着。和平拥护者的力量已巩固和组织起来，不断地揭发着战争挑拨者。
    现代资本主义基本经济法则的作用和社会主义基本经济法则的作用的对立性，决定经济发展的两条相反的路线。现代资本主义的经济路线引导至生产力的停滞，引导至世界资本主义体系总危机的加深和生产过剩的经济危机的重演，引导至畸形的、片面的战争经济，这种战争经济使生产力破坏和人们死灭。
    以苏联为首的社会主义和民主阵营的经济路线，——这是和平经济发展的路线，它不知道危机和失业，保证人民群众的物质和文化的水平逐步提高。
    现代资本主义的基本经济法则说明了帝国主义国家的侵略的、掠夺的政策的原因，说明了帝国主义国家间的矛盾增长的原因。这一法则的作用使资本主义的总危机加深，使资本主义社会的一切矛盾必然增长和爆发。
    现代资本主义的基本经济法则和社会主义的基本经济法则证明：资本主义制度已经活过了自己的时代，它应当让位给新的、更高级的社会主义制度。
    我国人民在苏维埃政权存在的三十五年期间在列宁—斯大林党的领导下获得的伟大胜利，极其明显地证明了社会主义对于资本主义的有决定意义的优越性。
