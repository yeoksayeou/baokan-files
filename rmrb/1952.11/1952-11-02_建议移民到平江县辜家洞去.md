    Suggestion to Immigrate to Gujiadong, Pingjiang County
    Editor: Zhang Kualong, a cadre of the Pingjiang County Cooperative Headquarters in Hunan Province, investigated the situation of cooperatives in the old revolutionary base area of the Seventh District of Pingjiang County. He learned that Gujiadong in this area stretches for more than 50 *li*, but villages are located about 20 *li* apart. During the First Revolutionary Civil War, this place had more than 4,000 people. However, due to the persecution by Chiang Kai-shek's bandits, only more than 700 people are left now, and more than half of them are not connected between the old and the young (lacking able-bodied young people), resulting in a very small labor force. Currently, there are many abandoned fields and barren mountains in the area, and the area is a producing area of bamboo and hemp. It would be a great pity if this continues. We suggest that the local people's government carry out some planned immigration work to make Gujiadong prosperous. The local people also have this demand.

    建议移民到平江县辜家洞去
    编辑同志：湖南省平江县合作总社干部张跨龙到平江县第七区老根据地调查有关合作社的情况时，了解到该区辜家洞地方纵横有五十多里，但其中相距二十里左右才有一个村落。该地在第一次国内革命战争时期，本有四千多人，后来受蒋匪的残害，现在只剩下七百多人，且老幼不相接（没有青壮年）的占半数以上，所以劳动力很少。现在，该地荒田、荒山很多，而该地又是一个产竹、麻的地区，这样继续下去太可惜了。我们建议当地人民政府有计划地作一番移民工作，使辜家洞繁荣起来；当地人民也有这种要求。
