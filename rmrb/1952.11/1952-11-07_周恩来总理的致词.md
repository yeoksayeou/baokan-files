Comrades and friends:

	All the working people of the world are warmly celebrating their own festival – the 35th anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution. Allow me, on behalf of the Chinese people, the Chinese government, and the Chinese Communist Party, to extend warm congratulations here to the great Soviet people, to Comrade Stalin, the great teacher of progressive mankind throughout the world and the most beloved friend of the Chinese people.

	At a time when the Chinese people are celebrating the 35th anniversary of the October Socialist Revolution, the messengers of the great Soviet people – the Soviet cultural workers delegation, the Soviet art troupe, the Soviet Army Red Flag Song and Dance Ensemble, and the Soviet film artists delegation – have come to participate in the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month" activities, which makes us feel extremely excited and honored. Here, I would like to extend a warm welcome to our guests and thank them for bringing the brotherly friendship of the Soviet people to the Chinese people!

	The victory of the Great October Socialist Revolution and the brilliant achievements of the Soviet people in socialist construction have, over the past 35 years, inspired the people of the world to continuously advance in their struggle for peace, democracy, and socialism. During World War II, the Soviet people liberated all mankind from the threat of fascist iron heels. In the post-war years, the Soviet people have continued to make great efforts to realize mankind's highest ideal, communism, to combat imperialist warmongers, and to defend world peace. Comrade Stalin's recently published classic work "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR" and his speech at the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union pointed out the specific path to the realization of communism in the Soviet Union and pointed out the great program of struggle and victory to the people of the world. Everyone in the world who holds reasonable hope for the future of mankind has, based on facts, recognized this truth, as Comrade Mao Zedong has long pointed out: the interests of the Soviet Union are consistent with the interests of all mankind.

	The Chinese people learned Marxism-Leninism from the Soviet Union and achieved revolutionary victory with the enthusiastic assistance of the Soviet people. The victory of the Chinese revolution has brought the traditional friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people into a new stage of development. In February 1950, under the personal guidance of Comrade Stalin and Comrade Mao Zedong, the two countries signed the Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance and other agreements; in September 1952, the two countries jointly issued an announcement on the transfer of the Chinese Changchun Railway to the Government of the People's Republic of China and an exchange of notes on extending the term of joint use of the Chinese Lushunkou Naval Base. These events have been warmly welcomed and supported by the Chinese people.

	In the past three years, the Soviet government has provided China with a large amount of material and technical assistance. Many Soviet experts have enthusiastically helped China's construction work. This generous and selfless assistance from the Soviet government has enabled us to smoothly consolidate our national defense, overcome the economic blockade of imperialist countries, and achieve rapid success in China's economic recovery.

	There is no doubt that continuing to strengthen the friendly cooperation between the people of China and the Soviet Union and better learn from the revolutionary theories of Lenin and Stalin and the advanced experience of Soviet socialist construction is of utmost importance to the victory of our country's large-scale economic construction that is about to begin.

	It is also beyond doubt that this infinitely enthusiastic assistance from the Soviet Union to our country cannot but arouse in our people an ever-deeper and stronger "trust, sympathy, and support" for the Soviet people, as Comrade Stalin hoped.

	The unity of the people of the two great powers, China and the Soviet Union, is based on common interests and mutual trust. Precisely because of this, as Comrade Mao Zedong said, this unity is "permanent, indestructible, and no one can separate it." This unity not only conforms to the interests of the people of China and the Soviet Union, but also to the interests of the people of the world. The Sino-Soviet friendship alliance, which aims at safeguarding peace, will surely shatter any adventurous plans of the imperialist aggressors.

	Long live the Great October Socialist Revolution!

	Long live the unbreakable, permanent, and fraternal friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union!

	Long live the bastion of world peace – the great Union of Soviet Socialist Republics!

	Long live Comrade Stalin, the most beloved friend of the Chinese people and the great leader and teacher of the working people of the world!

    周恩来总理的致词同志们、朋友们：
    全世界劳动人民，都在热烈庆祝自己的节日——伟大的十月社会主义革命三十五周年纪念日。让我代表中国人民、中国政府和中国共产党，在这里向伟大的苏联人民、向全世界进步人类的伟大导师和中国人民的最敬爱的朋友斯大林同志，致热烈的祝贺。
    在中国人民欢庆十月社会主义革命三十五周年纪念的时候，伟大的苏联人民的使者——苏联文化工作者代表团、苏联艺术工作团、苏军红旗歌舞团和苏联电影艺术工作者代表团前来参加“中苏友好月”的活动，使我们感到异常的兴奋和荣幸。在这里，我谨向我们的嘉宾致以热烈的欢迎，并感谢他们所带来的苏联人民对于中国人民的兄弟般的友谊！
    伟大的十月社会主义革命的胜利和苏联人民的社会主义建设的辉煌成就，在过去三十五年来，鼓舞着全世界人民的争取和平、民主和社会主义的斗争不断地前进。苏联人民在第二次世界大战中，从法西斯铁蹄威胁下解救了全人类。在战后的年代里，苏联人民为着实现人类最高理想共产主义，为着打击帝国主义战争贩子、保卫世界和平，继续做了巨大的努力。斯大林同志在不久以前发表的经典著作
    “苏联社会主义经济问题”和他在苏联共产党第十九次代表大会上的演说，指出了在苏联实现共产主义的具体道路，并向全世界人民指出了斗争和胜利的伟大纲领。全世界每一个对人类前途抱着合理希望的人，都已根据事实而承认了如同毛泽东同志早已指出的这个真理：苏联的利益和全人类的利益是一致的。
    中国人民是从苏联学得马克思列宁主义，并在苏联人民的热情援助下获得革命的胜利的。中国革命的胜利使中苏两国人民的传统友谊进入了发展的新阶段。一九五○年二月，在斯大林同志和毛泽东同志的亲自主持之下，中苏两国签订了友好同盟互助条约及其他协定；一九五二年九月，中苏两国又共同发表了关于中国长春铁路移交中华人民共和国政府的公告及关于延长共同使用中国旅顺口海军根据地期限的换文。这些事件都受到中国人民的热烈欢迎和拥护。
    三年来，苏联政府给予中国以大量的物资和技术上的援助。很多苏联专家热情地帮助中国的建设工作。苏联政府的这种慷慨无私的援助，使我们能够顺利地巩固国防、战胜帝国主义国家的经济封锁，并使中国的经济恢复工作取得迅速的成功。
    毫无疑问，继续加强中苏两国人民的友好合作，更好地学习列宁、斯大林的革命理论和苏联社会主义建设的先进经验，对于我国即将开始的大规模经济建设事业的胜利，具有极其重大的意义。
    同样毫无疑问的，苏联对于我国这种无限热情的援助，不能不引起我国人民对于苏联人民的愈来愈深、愈来愈强的“信任、同情和支持”，就如斯大林同志所希望的那样。
    中苏两大国人民的团结是建立在共同利益和互相信任的基础上的，正因为这样，如同毛泽东同志所说，这种团结是“永久的，不可破坏的，没有人能够分离的”。这种团结不仅符合于中苏两国人民的利益，而且符合于全世界人民的利益。以维护和平为目的的中苏友好同盟，必将打碎帝国主义侵略者的任何冒险计划。
    伟大的十月社会主义革命万岁！
    中苏两国人民牢不可破的永久的兄弟友谊万岁！
    世界和平的堡垒——伟大的苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟万岁！
    中国人民最敬爱的朋友、全世界劳动人民的伟大领袖和导师斯大林同志万岁！
