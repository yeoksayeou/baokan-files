My Appreciation of Galina Ulanova's Dance Art
Dai Ailian

With deep gratitude and love, we Chinese people welcome the Soviet artists who have come to participate in the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month." This gratitude and love are built on a solid foundation of internationalism. The Soviet artists' gracious visit will more closely strengthen the indestructible unity between us.

We cannot help but thank the Soviet people and their great leader Comrade Stalin, again and again, for sending so many great artists, beloved by the Soviet people and peace-loving people of all countries, to our country to introduce us to the outstanding achievements of Soviet art.

Originally, there was much to say about each artist; but here, please allow me to only talk about my impression of Galina Ulanova, People's Artist of the Soviet Union, Stalin Prize laureate, and the world's greatest ballet dancer.

Whenever the name Galina Ulanova is mentioned, whether by the person speaking her name or the person hearing it, their expression becomes unusually gentle, out of admiration, some intimate memory in their hearts, or a yearning born from not yet having seen her dance.

In 1949, I had the honor of visiting the Soviet Union. When the female attendants on the train learned that I was a dancer, they widened their eyes and mentioned Ulanova's name with affection. I was full of hope for this visit, but at that time, my wish was not fulfilled. I continued my journey and arrived in Prague. When someone learned that I was a dancer, they again asked me if I had seen Ulanova's dance. I regretfully replied that I had not. Later, a Czechoslovak friend of mine proudly told me that Ulanova had visited Czechoslovakia, and her visit had left an unforgettable memory in the hearts of the Czechoslovak people. Today, we Chinese people also welcome this world's greatest ballet dancer with a feeling of honor.

Before seeing Ulanova's performance, I had heard that her dances in tragedies moved audiences to tears, while her classical dances immersed people in the great images of that beauty. It is also said that dance art is the sum of all arts: sculpture, music, painting, and poetry. I had never experienced this so clearly in any of the dances I had seen in my life. But Ulanova's dance truly and clearly integrates these arts, creating the perfect art of ballet. When it comes to ballet, people often only think of ballet technique, but it is a mistake to limit this art to such a narrow meaning. Seeing Ulanova's dance is like seeing life itself, surpassing mere technique.

How can one describe in words the perfect elegance and comfort that Ulanova displays in the dance drama "Forest Fairy," choreographed by Fokine to Chopin's Waltz No. 64 in D-flat major?

When one is "lifted," people generally expect a quick jump or a slight change in expression, or at least a small movement due to a breath, but when Ulanova is lifted by her dance partner Kondratov, it gives the impression that there is no difference between being on the ground and being in the air. She seems to be dancing on another plane, something beautiful belonging to another world. But she belongs to our world, so she appears even more beautiful.

In the classical dance choreographed by Chabukiani to Schumann's music, Ulanova and her dance partner Kondratov's dance give many illusions. It is like seeing beautiful clouds passing by, or the pleasant breeze of the evening. Ulanova's dance is a series of perfect sculptures, each movement a masterpiece, each movement a poem. Her dance, especially the final pose when she is lifted off the stage with one arm by Kondratov, truly surpasses the sculptures of ancient Greece. Ulanova possesses perfect technique, but even more perfect is her expression. She gives such a pure sense of beauty that the audience holds their breath, as if wanting to immerse themselves more deeply and for longer in the illusion of this beautiful posture.

Without a doubt, Galina Ulanova is a Soviet artist. The great Soviet Union recently celebrated the glorious 35th anniversary of the October Revolution, and the fruits of the revolution have been reflected in the achievements of the Soviet people. The great Soviet people deeply know how to develop the talents of the people, and it is well known that the Soviet people are sure to do everything well, no matter what they do. That is why the imperialists are going mad. Some reactionary American dance magazine editors, for the sake of news or for other despicable purposes, also interview some people who have seen Ulanova's performances, but they label those people as communists or speak ill of them, trying to obscure the eyes of the public. The imperialists refuse to acknowledge every achievement of the Soviet people. And we know that every victory of the Soviet people strengthens the pillar of peace. Therefore, Ulanova's contribution is not only a contribution to the art of ballet, but also a great contribution to the women who stand at the forefront of the struggle to defend world peace.

We salute you, dear Galina Ulanova! You will forever remain in the hearts of the Chinese people. We are proud of you – our dear elder sister.

    我对于珈丽娜·乌兰诺娃舞蹈艺术的欣赏
    戴爱莲
    我们中国人民怀着深深的感激之情和热爱，欢迎前来参加“中苏友好月”的苏联艺术家们。这种感激和热爱是建立在国际主义的坚固基础上的。苏联艺术家们的盛意访问将更紧密地加强我们之间的不可摧毁的团结。
    我们不能不一次再次地感谢苏联人民及其伟大领袖斯大林同志，派遣了这么多备受苏联人民和各国爱好和平人民热爱的伟大艺术家们到我国来，向我们介绍苏联艺术的卓越成就。
    本来对每一位艺术家都有许多话要说；但是在这里，请允许我只谈谈苏联人民演员、斯大林奖金获得者、世界最伟大的巴蕾舞演员珈丽娜·乌兰诺娃给我的印象。
    一提到珈丽娜·乌兰诺娃的名字，不论是讲到她名字的人，或者是听到她名字的人，由于仰慕的心情，由于心中的某种亲密的记忆，或者由于还不曾看到她的舞蹈而产生的渴望，他们的表情就变得异样的柔和。
    一九四九年我曾荣幸地去访问苏联，当火车上的女服务员们知道我是一个舞蹈家时，她们睁大了眼睛，亲切地提到乌兰诺娃的名字。我对这一次访问充满着希望，但那时我还没有如愿以偿。我继续我的旅行，到了布拉格。当有人知道我是一个舞蹈家时，他们又问我是否看过乌兰诺娃的舞蹈。我遗憾地回答说，我没有看过。后来我的一位捷克斯洛伐克朋友骄傲地告诉我说，乌兰诺娃曾经去过捷克斯洛伐克，她的访问给捷克斯洛伐克人民留下了永系心头的记忆。如今我们中国人民也以荣幸的心情来欢迎这位世界最伟大的巴蕾舞演员了。
    在看到乌兰诺娃表演以前，我曾经听说她在悲剧中的舞蹈使观众感动到落泪，而她的古曲舞使人沉迷在那种美的伟大形象中。又据说舞蹈艺术是所有艺术的总和：雕刻、音乐、绘画和诗。在我一生所看见过的舞蹈中并没有体会得这样清楚。而乌兰诺娃的舞蹈却真是明显地把这些艺术融合在一起，创造了巴蕾舞的完美的艺术。一谈到巴蕾舞，人们时常就只想到巴蕾舞的技术，但是把这种艺术仅仅局限在这样狭窄的意义上是一种错误。看到乌兰诺娃舞蹈，就像看见生命本身，超乎技术上的一些东西。
    如何用言语来描述乌兰诺娃在福更斯以萧邦第六十四乐曲的第二华尔兹编作的舞剧“森林女神”中所表现的完美的优雅和舒适呢？
    在“举起”的时候，人们一般想会有一下急速的跳跃，或者轻微的改容，至少有由于一下呼吸而发生的小小移动，但是当乌兰诺娃被她的舞伴康德拉托夫举起的时候，给人一种印象：在地上和在空中毫无分别。她好像在另外的一个平面上舞蹈，一种属于另外一个世界的美的东西。但是她是属于我们这个世界的，所以她显得更美了。
    在查布奇安尼以舒曼的音乐编作的古典舞中，乌兰诺娃和她的舞伴康德拉托夫的舞蹈给人许多幻像。有如看见美丽的云彩飘过，又如傍晚的怡人的微风。乌兰诺娃的舞蹈是一系列完美的雕像，每一个动作都是一个杰作，每一个动作都是一首诗。她的舞蹈，特别是当她被康德拉托夫以一支手臂从舞台举起的那最后的一个舞姿，真是胜过古代希腊的塑像。乌兰诺娃具有一种完美的技术，但是更加完美的是她的表情。她给人这样一种纯真的美感，观众们屏息无声，好像要更深地和更长久地陶醉在这种美姿的幻象之中。
    毫无疑问，珈丽娜·乌兰诺娃是一位苏维埃的艺术家。伟大的苏联最近庆祝光荣的十月革命三十五周年，革命的成果已表现在苏维埃人民的成就中。伟大的苏维埃人民深深知道如何发展人民的才能，人所共知，苏联人民不管做什么都一定把它做得好。正因为这样，帝国主义者发疯了。有些反动的美国舞蹈杂志的编者，由于为新闻而新闻或者为了其他可鄙的目的，也访问一些曾看过乌兰诺娃表演的人们，但是，他们却给那些人带上红帽子或者说他们的坏话，想借此遮蔽民众的眼睛。对于苏联人民的每一成就，帝国主义者都是不肯承认的。而我们知道苏联人民的每一胜利都在加强和平的支柱。因此乌兰诺娃的贡献不仅是对于巴蕾舞艺术的贡献，而且是对于站在保卫世界和平斗争最前列的妇女们的伟大贡献。
    我们向你，亲爱的珈丽娜·乌兰诺娃致敬！你将永远留在中国人民的心里。我们以你——我们亲爱的大姊而骄傲。
