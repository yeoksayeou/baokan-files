The Assistance of Soviet Experts Played a Significant Role in the Restoration and Development of China's Coal Mining Industry
Liu Xiangsan, Director of the Coal Mine Management Bureau, Ministry of Fuel Industry, Central People's Government

The rapid restoration and development of China's coal mining industry in the past three years is inseparable from the enthusiastic assistance of Soviet experts.

Shortly after the national liberation, Soviet coal mining experts, including Stogov, Marchenko, Gargawi, and Lagulov, were invited to China. With a high degree of internationalism, they helped us solve many technical difficulties in the restoration and reconstruction of coal mines and unreservedly taught us advanced science, technology, and experience.

Before liberation, due to the barbaric and predatory mining methods adopted by imperialists and bureaucratic capitalists in our coal mines, the recovery rate was only 30 to 40 percent. Production technology stagnated in an extremely backward state for a long time. Coal was mined with hand picks, and transported by manpower pulling baskets, with an average per-worker production efficiency of less than 0.3 tons. The working environment for workers was extremely harsh. Most of the underground areas had natural ventilation, with only one cubic meter of air per person per minute at the working face. The underground temperature was generally above 25 degrees Celsius, and accidents were shockingly frequent. For example, in 1935, the Hongshan Coal Mine in Shandong was flooded, drowning more than 800 workers. In 1939, a coal dust explosion at the Jingxing Coal Mine killed 343 people. The workers at the Kailuan Coal Mine said, "Before liberation, a worker's life was not even worth as much as a mule!"

After the Soviet experts came to China, they combined the specific conditions of China's coal mines with advanced Soviet experience and vigorously helped us carry out production reforms. First, they proposed scientific coal mining methods for various coal seams based on the geological and coal seam conditions of each mine. These advanced coal mining methods were successfully tested with the specific help of Soviet experts and have been promoted throughout the country. At present, old-fashioned coal mining methods have been basically eliminated in state-owned coal mines, and new coal mining methods account for about 90 percent of the total recovery volume, with a recovery rate of 75 to 80 percent, greatly reducing the loss of national resources. In terms of tunneling methods, Soviet experts introduced "deep-hole operations," "hollow-eye bottom blasting method," and "empty-eye blasting method," which increased tunneling efficiency from about one meter per shot to two meters, or even three meters. At the Datong Coal Mine, groups such as Ma Liu Hai and Zhao You implemented a multi-hole cycle operation method, with an average daily progress of more than 20 meters. To ensure safe production, Soviet experts helped us formulate a method for calculating air volume based on the amount of gas released from various coal mines and abolished the old method of series ventilation, adopting a scientific and economical zone ventilation method. Now, the ventilation of state-owned coal mine shafts has been completely converted to mechanical ventilation, and most mine working faces have three cubic meters of fresh air per person per minute, with underground temperatures not exceeding 20 degrees Celsius. The safety and health of coal mine workers have been effectively guaranteed. Since the implementation of new coal mining methods, personal accidents have been basically eliminated on new working faces. This is what all coal mine workers are most sincerely grateful for.

Soviet experts have also helped us learn to use various mechanical operations and machine manufacturing. Workers at the Hongshan Coal Mine in Shandong can now use a coal cutter to cut grooves twice a day on a 120-meter-long working face, cutting 240 meters of coal. At the Huainan and Fengfeng coal mines, most of the mining workers can use pneumatic picks to mine coal. The work of recovering wooden pillars underground has also been mechanized, which not only reduces the labor of workers but also improves the recovery rate of pit wood and reduces production costs. Our mine machinery manufacturing plants are already able to manufacture small and medium-sized transportation machinery, such as endless rope winches, electric scrapers, above-ground loading machines, pneumatic picks, pillar recovery winches, large and small capstans, drilling machines, and other machinery.

Soviet experts cherish China's coal resources very much and try their best to help us mine all the coal that can be mined. After the first National Coal Mine Conference, some of our cadres believed that the shallow coal reserves of existing mines had been exhausted, and the expansion of deep coal seam mining and coalfield mining was limited by technical conditions. Therefore, it was estimated that 120 large and small mines would be abandoned before 1957, and the coal mine production capacity would be reduced as a result. However, after research by Soviet experts, it was found that many mines could actually be restored, and most mines could be reconstructed. After restoration and reconstruction, the production capacity of existing coal mines across the country will not only not decrease, but will be about 60 percent higher than in 1951. More importantly, the service life of most mines can be extended by 20 to 40 years. The central government's policy of "fully tapping potential and vigorously reconstructing" has been successfully implemented. The state has therefore saved a lot of investment. In the past, mines in North China mainly mined thick coal seams and rarely mined thin coal seams of about one meter. For example, the Yongdingzhuang Coal Mine in Datong did not mine coal seams with a thickness of 1.3 meters but specialized in mining coal seams of 2.5 meters. The Yangquan No. 4 Mine also never considered mining the two small coal seams above the thick coal. These examples exist in all mines. Soviet experts often reminded us, "Underground resources are the wealth of the country and must be cherished absolutely. Thin coal seams with a thickness of 0.4 to 1 meter, coal seams that need to be mined through water-bearing strata, coal seams with not very good quality, and coal seams under villages should all be mined." We have decided to follow the suggestions of Soviet experts and carry out mining.

In the past, some of our cadres, when encountering faults in coal mines, did not want to continue mining, thus often shortening the expected life of the mines and prematurely abandoning them. Soviet experts believed that this was not right. When encountering faults, we should try to pass through them and continue mining. For example, the Lifeng Mine of the Jiaozuo Coal Mine was originally planned to be abandoned in two years. After implementing the method of crossing faults proposed by Soviet experts, it successfully passed through two north-south faults, increased production capacity, and extended the life of the mine.

The construction work of coal mines has learned from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and accelerated the progress of the project. The drainage project of the No. 39 shaft of the Jiaozuo Coal Mine accepted the Soviet experts' suggestion of rapid drainage, and the project, which was scheduled to take 60 days, was completed in 15 days. The shaft lining project of the Wangfeng Mine learned from the advanced Soviet shaft lining experience and set a record of 10 meters per day. In drilling technology, after learning the Soviet rapid drilling using mud method, the progress of the project was improved.

In this way, not only can the state save a lot of investment, but also our coal production can meet the needs of national industrial development in a timely manner. At the same time, it also allows us to have more ample time to conduct investigation and research, drilling design and other infrastructure preparation work.

In terms of business management, Soviet experts have helped us strengthen planning management and cost management, focusing on standardization work, implementing working face cost accounting, wellhead daily cost accounting, and unified supply of equipment and cost accounting procedures, and establishing underground shift handover and underground instruction systems.

In the past three years, the assistance of Soviet experts to the restoration and construction of China's coal mining industry, the above are just a few of the more prominent points. But these facts are enough to illustrate the selfless and profound friendship of the Soviet Union to the Chinese people. In order to further develop the coal mining industry and supply the needs of large-scale economic construction, we must work harder to learn from the Soviet Union and consolidate Sino-Soviet friendship.

    苏联专家的帮助对中国煤矿工业的恢复和发展起了巨大作用
    中央人民政府燃料工业部煤矿管理总局局长　刘向三
    中国煤矿工业，三年来能得到迅速恢复和发展，是和苏联专家的热情帮助分不开的。
    全国解放后不久，苏联煤矿专家司徒哥辽夫、马尔钦可、嘎尔嘎威、拉古洛夫等，应邀来到中国，他们以高度的国际主义精神，帮助我们解决了煤矿恢复与改建中的许多技术困难，并将先进的科学技术和经验毫无保留地教给我们。
    解放前，我国煤矿，由于帝国主义和官僚资本主义者采取了野蛮的掠夺式的开采方法，回采率仅达百分之三十至四十。生产技术长期停滞在极端落后的状态，采煤用手镐，运搬用人力拉筐，平均每工生产效率在零点三吨以下。工人工作环境十分恶劣，井下大部是自然通风，工作面风量每人每分钟仅有一立方公尺，井下温度普遍在摄氏二十五度以上，灾害事故之多，惊心怵目。如一九三五年，山东洪山煤矿透水，一次淹死职工八百余人。一九三九年，井陉煤矿煤尘爆炸，一次死亡三百四十三人。开滦煤矿的工人们说：“解放前工人的生命，还不如骡子值钱呢！”
    苏联专家到我国后，结合我国煤矿的具体情况，运用了苏联的先进经验，大力帮助我们进行了生产改革。首先，他们根据各矿井的地质和煤层情况，分别提出了各种煤层的科学的采煤方法。这些先进的采煤法，在苏联专家的具体帮助下，先后试验成功，并已在全国推广。目前，在国营煤矿中，基本上消灭了旧式的采煤方法，新法采煤分量已占总回采量百分之九十左右，回采率达到百分之七十五至八十，大大减少了国家资源的损失。在掘进方法上，苏联专家介绍了“深孔作业”、“空心眼底爆破法”、“空眼爆破法”等，使掘进效率由放一炮进一公尺左右提高到二公尺，甚至到三公尺。大同煤矿马六孩、赵有等小组，实行了多孔循环作业法，每天进度平均在二十公尺以上。为做到安全生产，苏联专家帮助我们制订了一套按煤矿各种瓦斯喷出量之大小计算风量的方法，废除了旧的串联通风的方法，采用科学的、经济的分区通风法。现在，国营煤矿矿井的通风，已全部改为机械通风，大部矿井工作面每人每分钟已有三立方公尺的新鲜风量，井下温度均不超过摄氏二十度。煤矿职工的安全与健康，得到了有力的保障。自实行新法采煤以来，在新工作面上，基本上消灭了人身事故。这是全体煤矿职工所最衷心感谢的。
    苏联专家也帮助我们学会使用各种机械操作和机器制造，山东洪山煤矿职工，已能在一百二十公尺长的工作面上，每天用割煤机掏槽两次，截割煤二百四十公尺。淮南、峰峰煤矿，采掘工人大部都能用风镐采煤了。井下回收木柱的工作也机械化了，不仅减轻了工人劳动，还提高了坑木回收率，降低了生产成本。我们的矿山机械制造厂，已经能够制造中小型运搬机械，如无极绳绞车、电溜子、井上装车机、风镐、回柱绞车、大小稳车、钻机等机械。
    苏联专家非常珍爱中国煤矿资源，尽量帮助我们开采一切可以开采的煤。在第一次全国煤矿会议后，我们部分干部曾认为现有矿井浅部煤量已采完，开采深部煤层和扩大煤田采掘范围又为技术条件所限制，因而估计一九五七年前将有大小一百二十个矿井废弃，煤矿生产能力将因之而减低。但是，经过苏联专家研究，实际上不少矿井可以恢复，大部分矿井可以改建。自经过恢复和改建后，全国煤矿现有矿井的生产能力，不但不减低，而且可比一九五一年提高百分之六十左右，更重要的是大部分矿井的服务年限，可以延长二十至四十年。中央提出的“充分发挥潜在力，大力改建”的方针，得到了胜利贯彻。国家因而节约了大量的投资。过去，华北各矿均以开采厚煤层为主，对一公尺左右的薄煤层很少开采。如大同永定庄煤矿，厚度一点三公尺的煤层不采，而专采二点五公尺的煤层。阳泉四矿厚煤上面还有二层小煤，也从未考虑过开采。这些例子，在各矿都有。苏联专家们经常提醒我们说：“地下的资源是国家的财富，绝对要爱惜。对于厚度由零点四至一公尺的薄煤层，需要通过含水地层开采的煤层，煤质不太好的煤层及村庄下部的煤层，都应当采出来。”我们已决定依照苏联专家的建议，进行开采。
    过去，我们部分干部，遇到煤矿的断层，就不想继续开采，因而往往缩短了矿井应有的年限，过早地报废。苏联专家认为这样不对，遇到断层应设法通过断层，继续开采。如焦作煤矿李封矿，原拟两年以后即报废，自执行苏联专家提出的过断层的办法后，顺利地穿过南北走向的两道断层，提高了生产能力，延长了矿井的寿命。
    煤矿的建设工作，学习了苏联的先进经验，加速了工程的进度。焦作煤矿三十九号井的排水工程，接受了苏联专家快速排水的建议，预定六十天的工程，十五天就排完了。王封矿砌井工程，学习了苏联先进砌井经验，创日进十公尺的纪录。在钻探技术上，学习了苏联的快速钻进使用泥浆法后，提高了工程进度。
    这样，不仅国家可以节省大量的投资，而我们的煤产量，也可以及时满足国家工业发展的需要，同时，也使我们有比较充裕的时间进行调查研究、钻探设计等基本建设的准备工作。
    在经营管理上，苏联专家帮助我们加强了计划管理与成本管理，重点进行了标定工作，施行工作面成本核算、井口当日成本核算和器材统一供应及成本核算规程，并建立井下交接班及井下各项指示制度等。
    三年来，苏联专家对我国煤矿工业的恢复与建设的帮助，上面所举的，只是较为突出的几点而已。但是这些事实已经足够说明苏联对我国人民无私的深厚的友谊了。为着进一步地发展煤矿工业，供应大规模经济建设的需要，我们一定要更加努力学习苏联，巩固中苏友谊。
