    Walking the Russian Road
    ——On the Understanding and Learning from the Soviet Union by Teachers at Tsinghua University
    Jin Feng
    "In politics, we must lean to one side, we must walk the Russian road; but in science, do we also have to do this?" Among Chinese intellectuals, some people once had such doubts; and some people hesitated and answered: "In science and technology, the capitalist countries of Britain and America are better, right?" Now, the teachers of Tsinghua University are answering this question with certainty: In science, we must also lean towards the Soviet Union, towards socialism, and towards the laboring people; in science, we must also "walk the Russian road," this is the conclusion.
    (1) Eyes Begin to Turn from Capitalism to Socialism
    During the hot summer vacation, the teachers of Tsinghua University were working without rest, discussing the adjustment of departments and the reform of courses. The direction of serving the construction of the motherland was certain, but where to start? Thanks to the Soviet Union, which sent teaching plans and syllabuses for all majors in various engineering universities.
    Within three days, more than one hundred young teachers and graduates rushed to translate the syllabuses of two hundred and five courses.
    Before the teachers' eyes, shone the brilliance of Soviet science and technology.
    We must further open this treasure.
    More than three hundred teachers, in three groups, rushed to learn Russian one after another.
    White-haired old professors changed their reading habits of decades, and together with dozens of middle-aged and young teachers, pronounced aloud, recited attentively, did exercises as earnestly as primary school students, and prepared for exams carefully.
    After half a month to twenty days, these teachers were able to independently read Russian professional books in their fields.
    More than one hundred teachers have already begun to translate Russian textbooks. After the start of the semester, the translation continued during the tense teaching work. Late at night, professors leaned over thick Russian textbooks, working diligently. The next day, the translated textbooks, with the fresh scent of ink, were sent to the students.
    These scenes are moving. Chinese senior intellectuals are learning Russian and learning from the Soviet Union with such enthusiasm for knowledge and enthusiasm for serving the construction of the motherland.
    The eyes of this part of Chinese intellectuals began to turn from capitalism to socialism. This is a fundamental change. This change reflects that natural scientists are beginning to understand communism, to understand the motherland's today and tomorrow, through their own paths, through the path of science and technology.
    (2) Due to Class Prejudice...
    The transformation is slow and even painful.
    Due to the influence of Anglo-American bourgeois education, and due to class prejudice, a part of Tsinghua University's teachers (like some other senior intellectuals) had a vague understanding of the Soviet Union for a long period of time. Deceived and蒙蔽ed by imperialist reactionaries, they closed their eyes to the facts of the Soviet Union. "American science is authoritative," some pro-American people deeply believed. Some people indiscriminately sent their papers to the United States, not distinguishing between friend and foe. Those who returned from Britain and Germany thought:
    "Academically, America is not as good as Britain, and Britain is not as good as Germany; as for the Soviet Union, it's out of the question." "When the Soviet Union implemented the Five-Year Plan in 1933, it still had to order goods from abroad and hire engineers, which shows that Soviet science and technology is not as good as Western Europe,"
    said a professor who had stayed in Europe for eight years. He now recalls that he lacked a little when he spoke—not considering the time, that was eighteen years ago. One professor was still lecturing in English last year, and he didn't care even when students opposed him. He stubbornly believed that he was "doing it for the good of the students." "Because," he thought, "to read engineering and technical reference books, you must read British and American ones, so that students can get used to English and it will be convenient for them to work in the future." Most professors believed: "It is impossible to imagine teaching without British and American reference books."
    Class prejudice made them unconsciously adopt an unscientific attitude to obliterate, ignore, and misunderstand the achievements of Soviet science. They declared: "In politics, we acknowledge the leadership of the proletariat, but in science and technology, the Anglo-American capitalist system is better." This made the students cultivated by the old Tsinghua University unable to adapt to the needs of the construction of the motherland.
    (3) First-Rate Science
    The key to the transformation lies in the change of the teachers' stand. Teachers who thought they were patriotic saw the harm of their bourgeois ideology to the youth and to the motherland in the "Three-Anti" Movement, and the vast majority of them initially broke with bourgeois ideology. Capitalist things went bankrupt in the minds of these intellectuals, and their eyes began to turn to socialist Soviet Union. Thus, the role of Soviet advanced experience in our country's construction, which they had always "turned a blind eye" to for the past three years, and a series of innovations in production technology and enterprise management, suddenly enlightened their minds.
    Before them unfolded the treasure of Soviet science, which has the glorious tradition of Russian science and is developing rapidly.
    Even though what they have come into contact with is only a very limited part, they can't help but exclaim: The level of Soviet science and technology is indeed very high! They especially like to compare it with the United States, Britain, and Germany, which they have always admired: The electric tractor does not exist in the United States, and the Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Station is the world's first. A professor who had long been infatuated with the luxury of Broadway in New York, saw Gorky Street in Moscow in the movie, with a dozen cars speeding side by side; he saw the splendor of the subway, and he also saw Moscow University under construction, with the walls and floors of the buildings directly manufactured in the factory and assembled with cranes. Seeing these, he was completely convinced that Soviet science and technology is the most advanced in the world.
    "What is important is the speed of development of Soviet science and technology," said a professor of automobile manufacturing in the Department of Mechanical Engineering. He calculated that compared with 1929, the American automobile industry has made almost no progress in these twenty-three years; while the Soviet automobile industry has increased three hundred times during the same period.
    "What is more important," said an old professor, "is that Soviet science is in the hands of the people and serves the constantly increasing material and cultural needs of all members of society, so Soviet science is vigorously developing." "While in the United States," he frankly admitted that he only recently understood, "American science is in the hands of monopoly capitalists, serving the excess profits of big bosses. This makes the development of American science increasingly shrink, stagnate, and even regress."
    (4) First-Class Teaching Materials
    Now, when they come into contact with their specific work—teaching plans, syllabuses, and teaching materials—they immediately discover the errors in their previous views, such as the idea that "Soviet science only emphasizes practice and not theory" and "Soviet scholarship is specialized but not deep." The courses arranged in the teaching plan of the Soviet engineering universities surprised them. The basic science courses in the teaching plan are very broad, and the content is wider than the "American-style" or "British-style" plans they used to advocate. In the past, students in the Department of Aeronautical Engineering only studied physics, but now the Soviet teaching plan also includes chemistry and atomic physics. And when they saw the content of the teaching materials, they were even more surprised. The content of general chemistry for engineering students in the first year of university includes many materials of modern chemistry studied by senior students in the chemistry department, and the content of material mechanics and physics has doubled. Soviet university teaching materials are completely armed with the latest achievements of modern science, which makes many teachers feel like they are going back to the first year of university when preparing teaching materials. And the content of professional courses is practical and very detailed. The advancement of Soviet science is fully reflected in university teaching materials.
    The purposefulness and ideology of the teaching materials are very prominent. The content of each course, each chapter, each section, and even each class is purposefully adapted to the national economic plan. Learning from the Soviet experience, Tsinghua has newly opened many courses. A course on crane transportation is now a common course in various departments, which has never been the case in the past. Because, according to the Soviet experience, socialist engineers must know the process of labor transportation and must care about the automation and mechanization of the labor process. This is the attitude of socialist-trained engineers towards labor, people, and machines. The viewpoint of dialectical materialism runs through the teaching materials. In the introduction to general physics, Lenin's definition of matter is quoted, and Lenin's criticism of Machism in "Materialism and Empirio-criticism" is described. This makes many teachers feel the urgent need to study a compulsory science—Marxism-Leninism.
    The scientific achievements of the Soviet Union are closely combined with production practice and move forward. Therefore, teaching materials (especially professional teaching materials) are supplemented with new content almost every year. This makes many teachers feel that they must also step up the absorption of new nutrients in their business. In the past, there was a case where a textbook was taught for twenty years, and the teacher's work was always like this year after year, without seeing the future or the results. Now they are translating and learning at the same time, teaching and learning at the same time, and encountering many new things that need to be learned every day: the viewpoints are new, the materials are new, and the methods of narration are also new. The future of the construction of the motherland and the results of their work are also encouraging them. They feel the joy of creative labor.
    (5) In Science, We Must Also "Walk the Russian Road"
    Why has Soviet science made such achievements in just a few decades? Why do Soviet teaching materials have these advantages? After thinking about it, they understand: all this is inseparable from the socialist system. From here, from their own business, from the aspect of science and technology, these senior intellectuals realize the relationship between science and politics, realize the superiority of the socialist system, and also realize that the Soviet Union's today is our tomorrow. Thus, they come to a conclusion: To build our motherland, science and technology must also "walk the Russian road." They enthusiastically adopt the advanced Soviet teaching methods—conducting lectures through collectivist teaching and research groups. A professor who has taught "Electrical Engineering Principles" for more than ten years spent twenty hours preparing the "Introduction," humbly trying to teach it, and listening to the opinions of young teachers. In the teaching materials, many teachers began to incorporate patriotic content, closely linking teaching with the construction of the motherland.
    The teachers of Tsinghua University deeply realize from their own work that without the help of the Soviet Union, the reform and construction of our higher education would be impossible. It is the same in education, and even more so in politics and economy. As the October Revolution Day approaches, they are filled with gratitude to the Soviet Union. Some teachers are preparing to send the translated teaching materials to the original author to thank him for his help. Some teachers are increasing the speed of translation to commemorate this great festival. At a symposium, a teacher from the Department of Mechanical Engineering said meaningfully: "Our gratitude to the Soviet Union, the motherland of the working people of the whole world, is difficult to express in words. Only such thoughts can comfort ourselves, that is, our current work at Tsinghua—because of the help of the Soviet Union, we can undertake the work of training industrial construction cadres for the new China, is creating a happy today and tomorrow for our motherland and also for the working people of the whole world."

    走俄国人的路
    ——记清华大学教师的认识苏联、学习苏联
    金凤
    “在政治上要一面倒，要走俄国人的路；但是在科学上，是不是也要这样呢？”在中国知识界中间，一部分人曾经这样怀疑过；也有一部分人迟迟疑疑地回答：“科学技术方面，还是英美资本主义国家的好吧。”现在，清华大学的教师们，肯定地回答着这个问题：科学上也要倒向苏联，倒向社会主义，倒向劳动人民；科学上也要“走俄国人的路”，这就是结论。
    （一）眼光开始从资本主义转向社会主义
    炎热的暑假，清华大学的教师们不休息地在讨论着院系调整和课程改革。为祖国建设服务的方向是肯定的了，但是从那里着手呢？感谢苏联，送来了各种工科大学各门专业的教学计划和教学大纲。
    三天之内，一百多位年轻的教师和毕业生突击着把二百零五门课程的教学大纲翻译出来了。
    教师们的面前，闪耀着苏联科学技术的光芒。
    必须进一步打开这宝藏。
    三百多位教师，先后分三批突击学习俄文。
    白发苍苍的老教授，改变着几十年来读书的习惯，和几十个中年、青年的教师在一起，大声地拼音，专心地背诵，像小学生一样认真地做着练习，小心地准备着考试。
    半个月到二十天以后，这些教师们都能够独立阅读本行的俄文专业书籍。
    一百多位教师，已经开始翻译俄文的教材。开学以后，在紧张的教学工作中，翻译仍在继续着。深夜，教授们俯身在厚厚的俄文教科书上，辛勤工作着。第二天，翻出来的教材，散发着新鲜的油墨气息，送到学生手中。
    这些情景是动人的。中国的高级知识分子，是这样怀着求知的热情，怀着为祖国建设服务的热情，来学习俄文、学习苏联的。
    中国这部分知识分子的眼光开始从资本主义转向社会主义。这是一个根本的变化。这变化反映了自然科学工作者开始通过自己的道路，由科学技术的道路来认识共产主义，认识祖国的今天和明天。
    （二）由于阶级的偏见……
    转变是迟缓的甚至是痛苦的。
    由于英美资产阶级教育的影响，由于阶级的偏见，清华大学一部分教师（和其他一部分高级知识分子一样）在相当长的时期中对苏联的认识一直是模糊的。受了帝国主义反动派欺骗和蒙蔽的他们，闭目不看苏联的事实。“美国的科学是权威”，一些崇美派这样深信。有的人敌我不分地把自己的论文送往美国。从英国和德国回来的大陆派则以为：
    “学术上美不如英、英不如德；至于苏联，更谈不上。”“一九三三年苏联实行五年计划的时候，还要向国外订货和聘请工程师，可见苏联的科学技术不如西欧”，
    一位在欧洲待了八年的教授这样说。他现在回想起来，说话的当时就少了一点—没有考虑时间，那是十八年以前的事情。有一位教授到去年依然用英文讲书，学生反对他也不在意。他固执地以为他是“为学生好”。“因为”，他认为，“要看工程技术参考书籍非看英美的不可，让学生用惯英文将来工作方便。”大多数的教授都认为：“不能设想离开英美的参考书可以教书。”
    阶级的偏见使得他们不自觉地采取不科学的态度来抹煞、忽视和误解苏联科学的成果。他们声言：“在政治上承认无产阶级的领导，科学技术方面还是英美资本主义一套的好。”这就使得旧清华大学培养出来的学生事实上不能适应祖国建设的需要。
    （三）第一流的科学
    转变的关键在于教师立场的改变。自以为爱国的教师们在“三反”运动中看到自己资产阶级思想对于青年、对于祖国的危害，他们绝大多数初步地和资产阶级思想分了家。资本主义的东西在这些知识分子心目中破了产，他们的眼光开始转向社会主义的苏联。于是，一向“视而不见”的三年来在我们国家建设中苏联先进经验的作用，一系列的生产技术和企业管理的革新，使他们的头脑豁然开朗。
    在他们面前，展开了有着俄国科学光荣传统而又飞速发展的苏维埃科学的宝藏。
    纵然他们所接触的还只是很有限的一部分，但他们不禁发出赞叹：苏联的科学技术水平的确是很高的！他们特别爱和一向崇拜的美、英、德国相比：电力拖拉机美国是没有的，古比雪夫水电站世界第一。一位长期留恋着纽约百老汇豪华的教授，他看到电影中莫斯科的高尔基大街，十几辆汽车在并行飞驰；他看到地下铁道的富丽堂皇，他又看到建筑中的莫斯科大学，房屋的墙壁和地板直接从工厂中制造出来用起重机装配。看到这些，他完全信服苏联的科学技术是世界上最先进的。
    “重要的是苏联科学技术发展的速度”，一位机械制造系汽车制造专业的教授这样说。他算了一下：和一九二九年比起来，美国的汽车工业在这二十三年内几乎没有什么进展；而苏联汽车工业在同时期内增加了三百倍。
    “更重要的是”，一位老教授这样说，“苏联科学掌握在人民的手中，为社会全体成员不断增涨的物质及文化需要而服务，因此苏维埃科学生气蓬勃地不断发展。”“而在美国”，他坦白地承认自己直到最近才明白，“美国的科学是掌握在垄断资本家手中，为大老板的超额利润服务的。这就使得美国科学的发展日益萎缩、停滞以至倒退。”
    （四）第一等的教材
    现在，当他们接触到他们的具体业务——教学计划、教学大纲和教材的时候，他们立即发现以前的看法，例如认为“苏联科学只重实际、不重理论”“苏联学术专而不深”等等的错误。苏联工科大学教学计划排列的课程使他们吃了一惊。教学计划内基础科学课程非常广博，内容比他们以前所鼓吹的“美国式”或“英国式”计划都要广泛。以前航空工程系的学生只读物理，现在苏联的教学计划中还包括化学和原子物理。而当他们看到教材的内容时，又使他们吃了一惊。一本大学一年级读的工科用的普通化学所讲的内容包括化学系高年班所读的近代化学许多材料，材料力学和物理足足比以前的内容增多一倍。苏联大学的教材完全是用现代科学的最新成就武装起来的，这使得许多先生在预备教材时都有重上大学一年级的感觉。而专业课程的内容切合实际，分得非常精细。苏联科学的先进性在大学教材中完全反映出来了。
    教材的目的性和思想性很突出。每门课程、每一章、每一节乃至每一堂的课程内容都是有目的地适应国民经济计划的。学习着苏联的经验，清华新开了许多课程。有一门起重机运输现在是各系的公共课程，过去是从来没有的。因为根据苏联的经验，社会主义的工程师不可不知道劳动运输的过程，不可不关心劳动过程的自动化和机械化。这就是社会主义培养的工程师对于劳动、人和机器的态度。教材中贯穿着辩证唯物主义的观点。普通物理的序论中，引用列宁关于物质的定义，叙述列宁在“唯物论与经验批判论”中对马赫主义的批判。这使得许多教师迫切感到要学习一门必修的科学——马克思列宁主义。
    苏联科学成就密切结合着生产实践而前进。因此教材（特别是专业教材）几乎每年补充新的内容。这就使得许多教师感到自己在业务上也要加紧吸收新的养料。在从前，有过一本教材教二十年的事，教师的工作一年一年总是这样，看不到前途，看不到结果。现在他们一面翻译一面学习，边教边学，天天碰到许多新的需要学习的东西：观点是新的，材料是新的，叙述的方法也是新的。祖国建设的前途和他们工作的成果又鼓舞着他们。他们感到创造性的劳动的喜悦。
    （五）科学上也要“走俄国人的路”
    为什么苏联科学在短短几十年中会有这样的成就呢？为什么苏联教材有这些优点呢？想了一想，他们明白了：这一切是和社会主义的制度分不开的。从这里，从自己的业务，从科学技术方面，这些高级知识分子认识到科学与政治的关系，认识到社会主义制度的优越，也更认识到苏联的今天就是我们的明天。这样他们得出了一个结论：要建设我们的祖国，科学技术也要“走俄国人的路”。他们热情地采用苏联先进的教学方法——通过集体主义的教研组进行讲学。教过十多年“电工原理”的教授，花了二十个小时准备着“序论”，虚心地试讲，倾听年轻教师们的意见。在教材中许多教师开始贯穿爱国主义的内容，将教学和祖国建设密切联系起来。
    清华大学的教师们，从自己的工作中深深体会到：没有苏联的帮助，我们高等教育的改革和建设是不可能的。教育上是这样，政治、经济方面更是如此。在十月革命节来临的时候，他们对苏联满怀着感激的心情。有些教师准备把所翻译的教材寄给原作者，感谢他的帮助。有些教师增加翻译的进度，来纪念这个伟大的节日。在一个座谈会上，一位机械制造系的教师意味深长地说：“对于全世界劳动人民的祖国——苏联，我们的感激是难以用言语表达的。只有这样的思想可以安慰我们自己，就是我们现在在清华的工作——由于有了苏联帮助而使得我们可以担负起为新中国培养工业建设干部的工作，是为我们祖国、也是为全世界劳动人民创造着幸福的今天和明天。”
