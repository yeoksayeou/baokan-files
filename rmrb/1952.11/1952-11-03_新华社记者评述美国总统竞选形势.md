Xinhua News Agency, November 1st dispatch: A reporter from the Xinhua News Agency commented on the U.S. presidential election situation, stating:

    The U.S. presidential election will be held on November 4th. The two major parties of the U.S. ruling bloc—the Republican Party and the Democratic Party—have been noisily stepping up their election campaigns since they each selected their presidential candidates in July.

    Although American voters are most concerned about the issue of war and peace, and about immediately ending the Korean War and transitioning the war economy to a peaceful track, the two parties, which consistently pursue a policy of aggression and war preparation, have for a long time avoided this issue as a topic of the election campaign, because both sides admit that they are only marginally different in this regard. The two parties avoid taking a stance on the fundamental issue of war and peace in their campaigns, so as not to reveal their hidden conspiracies to prepare for new wars and prolong the Korean War. Therefore, for a time, the election machines of the two parties beat the drums and cymbals in a clamor over corruption, mutually exposing each other's scandals in order to divert voters' attention from the central issue. However, the American people are so urgently demanding an answer to this question that the two parties have had to modify their campaign strategies. Regarding this, "U.S. News & World Report" magazine recently wrote: "Those uninteresting problems in the campaign have been cast aside," and now, "Stevenson and Eisenhower have both discovered that war and related issues will have a decisive influence on winning votes."

    In view of the American people's strong desire for peace, the two parties' presidential contenders have tried their best to portray themselves as standard-bearers of peace, but their anti-Soviet and anti-communist hysterical remarks make their peaceful masks seem absurdly ridiculous. Democratic presidential candidate Stevenson, in many of his speeches, desperately defended the Truman government's so-called "stopping aggression" war in Korea and the "containing aggression" war preparations in Western Europe. Everyone knows that Truman's "stopping aggression" and "containing aggression" are just other names for "carrying out aggression" and "preparing for aggression." Republican presidential candidate Eisenhower, in order to appear even "tougher" than Truman's Democratic Party and to curry favor with the Wall Street bosses, even recklessly proclaimed at the "American Legion" convention that his policy was to use force to "liberate" the so-called "people behind the Iron Curtain."

    Since the two parties have no differences on the path of aggression and war preparation, the election disputes are concentrated on who can execute this policy more effectively. However, this kind of dispute among the two parties' competitors can only lead to an unpleasant conclusion for the Wall Street bosses, which is that the policy of aggression and war preparation pursued by the U.S. government since the end of the war has repeatedly failed. The Republican Party, taking advantage of its position as the "opposition party," completely disavowed its responsibility for the post-war U.S. bipartisan foreign policy, and vigorously criticized the Truman government for bringing about the failures of American imperialism. Eisenhower attacked the Truman government's policy for not only failing to "contain communism," but on the contrary, as a result of this policy, "from Czechoslovakia to China" there occurred a series of disturbing "unfortunate events" (September 22 speech in Cincinnati). In his view, the continuous growth of the post-war peace and democracy camp proves that the current policy of aggression is ineffective. Eisenhower also pointed out that although the Truman government spent a large amount of dollars to "aid" its vassal states, "the relationship between the United States and other countries is worse than it was in 1946" (October 21 speech in New York). Not only that, but even in Latin America, which is boastfully called its "private preserve" by U.S. imperialism, "terrible disappointment has arisen everywhere," and the United States "has lost the trust and respect of South American countries" (according to the Associated Press, New Orleans, October 13). In this way, Eisenhower revealed the festering sores of the Truman government's policy of aggression and war preparation while promoting himself.

    The Democratic Party could not refute these facts, so it tried its best to let people know that Eisenhower was until recently a senior official of the Truman government, and an active proponent and executor of the war preparation plan in Western Europe. Truman clearly pointed out in his speech campaigning for the Democratic Party: "Eisenhower himself occupied a very important position in formulating the various decisions that Eisenhower is currently criticizing as being wrong," so Eisenhower "can never escape the relationship" (Associated Press, Oakland, October 4). Truman and Stevenson even dug out confidential files to prove that Eisenhower participated in the decision-making of various major issues, especially in terms of foreign military policy.

    Since the two parties have proven the failures of the past in their disputes, they need to find ways to extricate themselves from the current predicament. The Republican Party, attempting to drive the Democratic Party out of the White House, first encountered this difficulty. For Eisenhower, who had transformed from a faithful executor of Truman's policies into a "critic," it was not difficult to cite facts to attack the failure and impracticality of Truman's policies, but what effective alternative solutions could the Republican Party offer? For this question, from Eisenhower to all Republican politicians, they could only equivocate. Eisenhower once attempted to bluff his way through by making sensational war cries. However, his "call" to launch an anti-Soviet "crusade" caused such a big uproar in the United States and other capitalist countries that he had to quickly change his tune and declare that his proposal had been misunderstood. After Eisenhower's demagogic trick was thwarted, he attempted to play another stimulating trick. On October 24, he suddenly announced that if elected, he would immediately go to Korea to seek a quick solution to the war. If it is really to end the Korean War, why go to Korea in person? When Eisenhower was pressed, he admitted that his idea was only to "discuss how to replace U.S. troops with South Korean manpower" (United Press International, October 27). In this way, Democratic politicians immediately pointed out that this method of using Asians to fight Asians was not new, and that the Truman government had already done so in Korea. Eisenhower saw that this approach was ineffective. In countering Eisenhower's flamboyant campaign tactics, the Democratic Party acknowledged that U.S. imperialism had fallen into a predicament of being unable to do what it wants. Truman made it clear: on the Korean War issue, "there is no 'superman' who can solve our difficulties." In this way, Truman not only cursed Eisenhower, but also slapped himself in the face. Everyone knows that it was Truman and Stevenson who shamelessly praised the bankrupt "police action" in Korea in their speeches, calling it one of the main achievements of the Truman government. In fact, the Democratic Party could not find any way out other than pretending to be strong. According to Eisenhower, the Democratic Party's "cheering every failure" cannot "turn failure into victory."

    The two parties' vociferous campaign activities not only reflect the dying throes of the U.S. ruling bloc, but also fully demonstrate the baseness and shamelessness of the two parties' politicians. The American people urgently demand peace, but the two reactionary parties serving Wall Street monopoly capital refuse to change their policy of aggression and war preparation. In order to cover up their true faces, they use all kinds of despicable methods, even unimaginable ones. Because all their arguments are so hypocritical, the politicians of the two parties often contradict themselves. This series of terrible and unbearable farces has aroused the increasing disgust of American voters. The "New York World-Telegram and Sun" admitted: "The national electorate's sense of disgust with the two parties' campaign activities is expanding." The newspaper cited a "most typical opinion" as: "There are too many despicable and dirty things in this campaign." Another young American store clerk pointed out fairly in a conversation with the newspaper reporter: "It seems that everyone is lying." This is indeed the case. Republican and Democratic politicians have no other way to campaign except to lie. Both parties are tools of Wall Street financial oligarchs, both pursue a policy of aggression and war preparation, but both try their best to conceal this unspeakable policy. The fragile nature of U.S. imperialism is thus fully exposed. Especially because this policy is being thwarted everywhere by the growing resistance of peace-loving people all over the world, the politicians of the two parties have to resort to lies to deceive the American voters.

    Through the miasma of the two parties' campaign movements, the American Progressive Party, representing the American people, issued a powerful call. Regardless of the American reactionaries' obstruction and intensified terror and persecution, the Progressive Party waged an unyielding struggle, bringing the call for peace to voters across the country. At present, the Progressive Party has obtained candidate status in nearly thirty states. Led by presidential candidate Hallinan and vice presidential candidate Mrs. Bass, the Progressive Party constantly exposes the Republican and Democratic candidates' endless lies, revealing that they advocate adhering to aggressive wars and implementing war preparation plans in order to guarantee the huge profits of large capitalist groups. The Progressive Party candidates reflect the true will of the American people, demanding that the U.S. government immediately stop the Korean War, reduce armaments, and use a large amount of money not for establishing aggressive blocs and military bases, but for peaceful production and promoting the welfare of the people. Although the two major reactionary parties are doing their best to blow the "anti-communist" horn in order to create a terror atmosphere against the Progressive Party, the Progressive Party's call is receiving a warm response from peace-loving Americans.

    The 1952 U.S. presidential election marks the dead end and depravity of the U.S. ruling bloc, which is obsessed with aggression, and shows that the more lies it tells, the more notorious it becomes. As the U.S. aggressive policy fails on all fronts around the world, it is becoming increasingly difficult for the U.S. ruling bloc to rely on war hysteria propaganda to poison the conscience of the American people. Although they can manipulate the outcome of the election and send Eisenhower or Stevenson to the White House, it can be asserted that the progressive forces in the United States, represented by the American Communist Party and the Progressive Party, will continue to grow, and an increasing number of Americans will awaken and firmly block the road to war and destruction.

    新华社记者评述美国总统竞选形势
    【新华社一日讯】本社记者评述美国总统竞选形势称：
    美国总统选举即将在十一月四日举行。美国统治集团的两大政党——共和党和民主党自从七月间各自择定总统候选人以来，一直在吵吵闹闹地加紧进行竞选活动。
    虽然美国选民最关心的是战争与和平的问题，是立即结束朝鲜战争并且把备战经济转入和平的轨道；但是一致奉行侵略备战政策的两党却在很长时间内没有把这个问题当作竞选的题目，因为，双方都承认，在这方面它们彼此之间只是半斤八两而已。两党在竞选中避免对战争与和平的根本问题表明态度，以免透露它们不可告人的准备新战争和拖延朝鲜战争的阴谋。因此，在一个时期里，两党竞选机器在贪污问题上擂鼓齐鸣地互相揭发对方的丑事，以转移选民对于中心问题的注意。但是，美国人民是如此迫切地要求回答这个问题，以致两党不得不修改它们的竞选策略。关于这一点，“美国新闻与世界报道”杂志最近写道：“竞选中那些不能吸引人的问题被抛开了”，现在，“史蒂文森和艾森豪威尔都已发现，战争及有关的问题对于争取选票将有决定性的影响”。
    鉴于美国人民的强烈的和平愿望，两党的总统逐鹿者竭力把自己粉饰成和平的旗手，但是他们的反苏反共歇斯底里的言论却使他们的和平假面具看来简直荒谬得可笑。民主党总统候选人史蒂文森在他的许多发言里，拚命辩护杜鲁门政府在朝鲜进行的所谓“制止侵略”的战争和在西欧进行的“遏止侵略”的备战活动。大家知道，杜鲁门的“制止侵略”和“遏止侵略”，不过是“进行侵略”和“准备侵略”的别名。共和党总统候选人艾森豪威尔，为了表现自己比杜鲁门的民主党更“强硬”以取宠于华尔街老板，甚至在“美国退伍军人团”大会上信口开河地扬言他的政策是要以武力来“解放”所谓“铁幕后面国家的人民”。
    两党既然在侵略备战路线上并无分歧，因此竞选争吵就集中在谁执行这个政策更能干上面。然而，两党竞争者的这种争吵，只能得出一个对于华尔街老板来说是不愉快的结论，这就是大战结束以来美国政府所奉行的侵略备战政策接二连三的失败了。共和党利用它“在野党”的地位，把它对战后美国两党外交政策所应负的责任推得一干二净，竭力斥责杜鲁门政府带来了美帝国主义的失败。艾森豪威尔攻击杜鲁门政府的政策不但未能“遏止共产主义”，相反地，由于这个政策的结果，“从捷克斯洛伐克到中国”发生了使他梦寐不安的“一连串不幸事件”（九月二十二日在辛辛那提的演说）。在他看来，战后和平民主阵营的不断壮大就证明了现行侵略政策毫无成效。艾森豪威尔还指出，杜鲁门政府虽然花费了大量美元来“援助”仆从国家，但是“美国和各国之间的关系反而比一九四六年的情况还要坏”（十月二十一日在纽约的演说）。不仅如此，甚至在被美帝国主义夸口称为它的“禁脔”的拉丁美洲，也“到处都产生了可怕的失望情绪”，美国“已经失掉南美国家的信任和尊敬”（据美联社新奥尔良十月十三日电）。这样，艾森豪威尔在为自己捧场中就把杜鲁门政府侵略备战政策的脓疮都揭露出来了。
    民主党无法对这些事实进行反驳，就竭力让人知道：艾森豪威尔不久以前还是杜鲁门政府的高级人员，是西欧备战计划的积极的主张者和执行人。杜鲁门在替民主党竞选的演说中明白指出：“在制定被艾森豪威尔目前指责为错误的各项决定时，艾森豪威尔本人占有很重要的地位”，因此艾森豪威尔“决不能摆脱关系”（美联社奥克兰十月四日电）。杜鲁门和史蒂文森并且翻出了机密档案，证明艾森豪威尔是参预了各种重大问题的决策的，尤其是在对外军事政策方面。
    两党在争辩中既然证明了过去的失败，就需要找出办法来解脱目前的困境。企图把民主党赶出白宫的共和党，首先碰到了这个难题。对于从杜鲁门政策的忠实执行人摇身一变而为“批评者”的艾森豪威尔来说，要举出事实来攻击杜鲁门政策的失败和行不通，倒是不难，但是共和党又能拿得出什么有效的代替办法来呢？对于这个问题，从艾森豪威尔起到所有共和党的政客们止曾经只能支吾其词。艾森豪威尔曾一度企图以耸人听闻的战争叫嚣来虚张声势。可是他的发起反苏“十字军”的“号召”，在美国和其他资本主义国家引起了这样大的骚动，以至于他不得不赶紧改变腔调，声明他的主张被人误解了。艾森豪威尔在他的哗众取宠的诡计碰壁之后，又企图玩弄另一个刺激人心的手段。十月二十四日，他忽然宣布，他如果当选，要立即到朝鲜去寻求迅速解决战争的办法。如果是真的要结束朝鲜战争，何必要亲自到朝鲜去呢？艾森豪威尔在被追问得不得已的时候承认，原来他的主意不过是“商量如何以南朝鲜人力来接替美军”（合众社十月二十七日消息）。这样一来民主党的政客们立即指出，这种用亚洲人来打亚洲人的办法并不新鲜，而且杜鲁门政府早已在朝鲜这样做了。这种做法无成效是艾森豪威尔看到了的。民主党在反击艾森豪威尔这种招摇撞骗的竞选手段时，承认美帝国主义已陷于力不从心的窘境。杜鲁门说得很清楚：在朝鲜战争问题上，“决没有什么‘超人’可以解决我们的困难”。这样，杜鲁门不仅骂了艾森豪威尔，而且打了自己一个耳光。大家知道，正是杜鲁门和史蒂文森在他们的演说里大言不惭地颂扬在朝鲜的破产了的“警察行动”，把它说成是杜鲁门政府的主要政绩之一。事实上，民主党除了打肿脸充胖子，就再也找不到什么出路。按照艾森豪威尔的说法，民主党“欢呼每一次的失败”，并不能“把失败变成胜利”。
    两党声嘶力竭的竞选活动，不仅反映出美国统治集团的日暮途穷，而且十足地表现了两党政客的卑污与无耻。美国人民迫切要求和平，但是为华尔街    垄断资本服务的两大反动政党拒绝改变它们的侵略备战政策。为了掩盖自己的真面目，它们使用了一切甚至叫人想像不到的卑鄙手法。由于他们的全部争论是如此虚伪，两党政客们就经常地自相矛盾。这一连串恶劣不堪的丑剧引起美国选民日益增加的憎恶。“纽约世界电讯太阳报”承认：“全国选民对两党竞选活动的厌恶感觉正在扩大”。该报举出一个“最典型的意见”是：“这次竞选活动里面，卑鄙肮脏的事情太多了。”另一个美国青年店员在和该报记者谈话时公正地指出：“看来每一个人都在撒谎。”事实的确如此。共和党和民主党的政客们在竞选中除了撒谎以外再也没有别的办法了。两党都是华尔街财政寡头的工具，都是奉行侵略备战政策，但同样都竭力掩饰这个不可告人的政策。美帝国主义的脆弱本质就这样的完全暴露出来。特别是由于这个政策在全世界爱好和平人民日益增长的抗击下到处碰壁，两党的政客们只好求助于谎言来哄骗美国选民。
    透过两党竞选运动的乌烟瘴气，代表着美国人民的美国进步党，发出了有力的呼声。不顾美国反动派的百般阻挠和变本加厉的恐怖迫害，进步党进行了不屈不挠的斗争，把和平的呼声带到全国各地的选民中去。目前进步党已在将近三十个州中取得了候选权。以总统候选人哈利南和副总统候选人巴斯夫人为首，进步党不断戳穿共和党及民主党竞选人的连篇谎话，揭露他们为保证大资本集团的庞大利润而主张坚持侵略战争和实行备战计划。进步党候选人反映美国人民的真正意志，要求美国政府立即停止朝鲜战争，裁减军备，并把大量金钱不是用于建立侵略集团和军事基地，而是用于和平生产与促进人民福利。尽管两大反动政党竭力吹响“反共”的喇叭，以制造反对进步党的恐怖气氛，但是进步党的呼唤正得到美国爱好和平人士的热烈响应。
    一九五二年美国总统竞选，标志着醉心侵略的美国统治集团的走头无路和堕落，表明了它的谎话说得越多，它就越声名狼籍。随着美国侵略政策在全世界各个战线上的失败，美国统治集团要想依靠战争歇斯底里的宣传来毒害美国人民的良知是越来越困难了。尽管他们可以操纵选举的结果，把艾森豪威尔或是史蒂文森送进白宫，但是，可以断言：以美国共产党和进步党为代表的美国进步力量将要不断增长，日益众多的美国人民将要觉醒起来并坚决堵塞走向战争与毁灭的道路。
