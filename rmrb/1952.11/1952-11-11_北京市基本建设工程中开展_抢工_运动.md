In Beijing's basic construction projects, a large-scale "Seize the Day" campaign is underway, striving to complete all unfinished tasks of this year's construction projects in the forty-odd days before the ground freezes.

Due to the lack of clear division of labor in the leadership of the local state-owned Beijing Construction Company, inflexible organizational structure, insufficient planning in accepting tasks, poor construction management, untimely supply of materials and equipment, and failure to vigorously promote advanced production experiences, coupled with late commencement of work, too many temporary rush tasks, scattered construction sites, and frequent changes in design drawings, only 50 percent of the 1952 tasks had been completed by mid-October. In light of this situation, the Beijing Construction Company made an urgent mobilization. Li Gongxia, the manager of the company, called on workers in all work areas to launch a "Seize the Day" campaign at the employee representative meeting on October 17. Now, all construction workers at more than 100 construction sites in Beijing have been投入into the "Seize the Day" campaign. They are in high spirits and confident of completing the year's tasks by the end of November.

Based on the work situation in the past ten days or so, it has been seen that the following issues must be noted and resolved in the "Seize the Day" campaign: 1. Make preparations for "Seizing the Day" in advance, line up all projects, determine the key points of "Seizing the Day", and oppose the average use of strength. 2. Do a good job in full ideological mobilization, strengthen discipline and unity, oppose departmentalism that disregards the overall situation, and ensure that everything is for the completion of tasks, everything is facing the construction site, and everything is serving the construction site. 3. After the "Seize the Day" campaign begins, we must pay close attention to project quality, and oppose blindly pursuing project progress and numbers. 4. We must emphasize the promotion of advanced production experiences that have a decisive significance, especially the promotion of large-scale assembly line operations in which various types of work are combined. 5. We must pay attention to safe "Seizing the Day" and oppose the idea and practice of only caring about "Seizing the Day" without regard for the safety of workers; we must promptly resolve the urgent demands of workers, such as dormitory and winter clothing issues. 6. Pay attention to frost prevention work as much as possible.

### 北京市基本建设工程中开展“抢工”运动

    北京市基本建设工程中开展“抢工”运动
    北京市基本建设工程中正开展着一个大规模的“抢工”运动，争取在上冻前四十多天内完成今年建筑工程的全部未完成的任务。
    北京市的基本建设工程，由于地方国营北京市建筑公司领导上缺乏明确分工、组织机构不灵活、接受任务计划性不够、施工管理不好、器材供应不及时、先进生产经验没有大力推广，加上开工迟、临时性突击任务太多、施工地点零散和设计图样常常变更等客观困难，使一九五二年的任务，至十月中旬才完成百分之五十。根据这种情况，北京市建筑公司作了紧急动员，该公司经理李公侠在十月十七日员工代表大会上号召各工区工人展开“抢工”运动。现在北京全市一百多个工地上的建筑工人，已全部投入了“抢工”运动，他们情绪非常高涨，都有信心争取在十一月底完成全年的任务。
    根据最近十多天来的工作情况，已经看出在“抢工”运动中，必须注意和解决以下问题：一、事前做好“抢工”准备，把所有工程排排队，确定“抢工”重点，反对平均使用力量。二、作好充分的思想动员，加强纪律性和统一性，反对不顾全局的本位主义，做到一切为了完成任务，一切面向工地，一切为工地服务。三、“抢工”运动开始后，必须十分注意工程质量，反对盲目地单纯地追求工程进度和数字。四、必须强调推广有决定意义的先进生产经验，特别是要推广各个工种相互结合的大流水作业法。五、必须注意安全“抢工”，反对只顾“抢工”而不顾工人安全的思想和做法；必须及时解决工人中的迫切要求，如宿舍、冬衣问题等。六、尽可能地注意防冻工作。
