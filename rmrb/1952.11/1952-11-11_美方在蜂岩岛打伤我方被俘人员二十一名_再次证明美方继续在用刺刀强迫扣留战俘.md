    Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 10th—On November 6th, the US side again wounded twenty-one of our captured personnel in the Pi-do Island prisoner-of-war camp. This incident once again exposes the US side's great conspiracy to forcibly detain prisoners of war.
    On August 23rd, the US side declared that what was set up on Pi-do Island was a so-called "detained civilian camp." However, according to a United Press report, the US prisoner-of-war camp headquarters announced that those wounded on Pi-do Island on November 6th were "twenty-one North Korean prisoners of war." The US prisoner-of-war camp headquarters said that the reason why these twenty-one North Korean prisoners of war were wounded was because "detained civilians" held a "demonstration." This self-contradictory statement once again exposes the US side's shameless conspiracy to forcibly list prisoners of war as "civilians" and detain them. Regarding this conspiracy, the so-called International Committee of the Red Cross had already acknowledged it in its report on the US side's massacre of prisoners of war on February 18th. In the past few months, the US side has transferred 38,000 prisoners of war who were forcibly listed as "civilians" to the Syngman Rhee gang under the name of "release." The Pi-do Island incident shows that although the trick of detaining prisoners of war has been exposed, the US side will still "list" prisoners of war as "civilians" in order to continuously send them to the Syngman Rhee gang, forcing them to participate in the war of aggression and act as cannon fodder for the American army.
    As usual, the US prisoner-of-war camp authorities dare not reveal why the prisoners of war on Pi-do Island were "demonstrating"; what exactly were they shouting when they were "shouting at their guards in groups"? It is very clear that this is because the detained prisoners of war are unwilling to accept their enslaved fate and firmly demand to be repatriated to their motherland, so they have been persecuted by the US side. The Pi-do Island incident shows that the US side is still secretly using bayonets in its prisoner-of-war camps to create so-called "civilians" and prisoners of war who "refuse repatriation." This incident once again exposes the complete hypocrisy of the US government's so-called principle of "not forcibly repatriating prisoners of war."

    美方在蜂岩岛打伤我方被俘人员二十一名
    再次证明美方继续在用刺刀强迫扣留战俘
    【新华社开城十日电】十一月六日美方又在蜂岩岛战俘营打伤我方被俘人员二十一名。这一事件又一次揭穿了美方强迫扣留战俘的大阴谋。
    美方在八月二十三日曾经宣称设在蜂岩岛上的是所谓“被拘平民营”。但是据合众社报道，美方战俘营司令部宣布，十一月六日在蜂岩岛上被打伤的是“二十一名北朝鲜战俘”。美方战俘营司令部说，这二十一名北朝鲜战俘之所以被打伤，是因为“被拘平民”举行“示威”。这种自相矛盾的说法，又一次暴露了美方硬将战俘列为“平民”加以扣留的无耻阴谋。关于这个阴谋，所谓红十字国际委员会在其关于二月十八日美方屠杀战俘事件的报告中，早已承认过了。在过去几个月中，美方已经将三万八千名这样被硬列为“平民”的战俘，用“释放”为名移交给了李承晚匪帮。蜂岩岛的事件说明：虽然扣留战俘的把戏已经拆穿，美方仍然将在战俘“列为平民”，以便源源不绝地将他们送给李承晚匪帮，强迫他们参加侵略战争，去给美国军队替死。
    美方战俘营当局像往常一样，不敢透露蜂岩岛上的战俘究竟为什么要“示威”；他们“成群结队地向他们的守卫兵叫喊”，究竟是叫喊些什么。事情十分明显，这是因为被扣留的战俘不甘心于他们的被奴役的命运，坚决要求遣返他们回祖国，因此他们遭到了美方的迫害。蜂岩岛的事件说明：美方在其战俘营中仍然在秘密地用刺刀制造所谓“平民”和“拒绝遣返”的战俘，这一事件又一次揭穿了美国政府的所谓“不强迫遣返战俘”原则的彻底虚伪性。
