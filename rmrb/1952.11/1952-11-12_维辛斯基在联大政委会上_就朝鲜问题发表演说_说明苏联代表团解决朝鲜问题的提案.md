Xinhua News Agency, November 11th: TASS, New York - Vyshinsky, head of the Soviet delegation, delivered a speech to the Political Committee of the UN General Assembly on November 10th regarding the Korean question.

American newspapers had previously published news of Vyshinsky's scheduled speech on November 10th, noting that his speech had aroused great interest among UN personnel and would influence subsequent debates in the General Assembly.

In his speech, Vyshinsky provided a brief summary of the Political Committee's two-week discussion of the Korean question and exposed the policy of aggression against Korea pursued by the American ruling circles and the ruling circles of other countries following the United States.

The head of the Soviet delegation explained that the American ruling circles did not want to end the Korean War and concentrated their efforts on preventing the successful conclusion of the Korean armistice negotiations, attempting to sabotage the armistice negotiations and continuing the unjust war of aggression against Korea.

Finally, Vyshinsky more precisely explained the proposal put forward by the Soviet delegation on October 29th, listing the countries to be represented on the committee for the peaceful settlement of the Korean question (United States, Britain, France, Soviet Union, People's Republic of China, India, Burma, Switzerland, Czechoslovakia, Democratic People's Republic of Korea and South Korea), and clarified the committee's mandate.

The audience filling the hall listened intently to Vyshinsky's speech. It should be noted that during the meeting, attempts were made to weaken the impact of the head of the Soviet delegation's speech on the audience. Vyshinsky's speech was interrupted by loud knocking noises from nearby rooms.

Vyshinsky immediately asked the chairman of the committee to maintain order, otherwise, he would no longer continue to speak. Only then did the knocking noises stop.

    维辛斯基在联大政委会上
    就朝鲜问题发表演说
    说明苏联代表团解决朝鲜问题的提案
    【新华社十一日讯】塔斯社纽约讯：苏联代表团团长维辛斯基十一月十日在联合国大会政治委员会会议上就朝鲜问题发表演说。
    美国报纸事先登载了维辛斯基预定在十一月十日发表演说的消息，并指出他的演说引起联合国人士很大的兴趣并将影响大会以后的辩论。
    维辛斯基在他的演说中，对于政治委员会两周以来讨论朝鲜问题的情况作了一个简短的总结，并揭露了美国统治集团及其他国家统治集团追随美国之后所实行的侵略朝鲜的政策。
    苏联代表团团长说明了美国统治集团不要结束朝鲜战争并集中他们的力量不要使朝鲜停战谈判圆满结束，竭力破坏停战谈判并继续进行非正义的侵略朝鲜的战争。
    最后，维辛斯基更确切地说明了苏联代表团在十月二十九日提出的提案，一一列举派代表组成和平解决朝鲜问题委员会的国家（美国，英国，法国，苏联，中华人民共和国，印度，缅甸，瑞士，捷克斯洛伐克，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国与南朝鲜），并阐明了委员会的职权。
    挤满大厅的听众都全神贯注地倾听维辛斯基的演说。应该指出，在会议过程中，有人企图减弱苏联代表团团长的演说给予听众的印象。维辛斯基的演说曾被邻近房屋中很响的敲打声所打断。
    维辛斯基当即要求委员会主席设法维持秩序，否则，他将不再继续发表演说。直到这时，敲打声才停止下来。
