Speed Up the Training of Reserves and Do a Good Job in Coal Mine Drilling

The recent National Coal Mine Planning and Capital Construction Conference convened by the Central Fuel Industry Department clearly pointed out that in order to meet the needs of the country's large-scale economic construction, coal mine capital construction must be given top priority immediately, and geological drilling is the most important and fundamental preparatory work for coal mine capital construction. If the situation of underground resources is unclear, coal mine capital construction cannot be carried out at all. The drilling task for next year is very heavy. This task is not only directly related to next year but also to the progress of coal mine capital construction in the coming years.

At present, the state of our drilling work is very unsatisfactory and is a very weak link in coal mine capital construction. The general situation is: low efficiency, poor quality, and many accidents. Many coal mine workers complain about the large tasks and the small number of drilling rigs. The actual situation is very clear: the capacity of the existing drilling rigs has not been well utilized. The purpose of drilling work is to take core samples. However, some mines currently only pay attention to drilling progress but do not pay attention to taking core samples on time. As a result, although the drilling progress has improved a lot, there are not enough core samples to judge the underground coalfield situation. In some places, no attention is paid to preservation, and records are not properly kept, so that the core samples that have been taken cannot play a role. Frequent drilling rig accidents have seriously affected the improvement of drilling efficiency. According to statistics from various mines in Northeast China, about 30 percent of the time is taken up by accidents. Why can't these problems be solved quickly? In addition to objective difficulties, the basic reason is that some leading cadres have not truly realized the importance of drilling work, so they have not immediately assigned stronger cadres to the drilling department, and have not devoted more energy to taking care of drilling work. Some units are still waiting for the higher authorities to find ways to solve the difficulties of insufficient technical cadres and technical workers, believing that only when all conditions are available can the face of this work be changed, and they are unwilling to actively overcome difficulties and create conditions.

Our drilling work tasks are very heavy and urgently needed, and the existing drilling force is very weak. How to solve this contradiction?

First, we must strengthen leadership and vigorously train reserve forces. In order to successfully and timely complete the drilling plan for next year, it is necessary not only to strengthen the leadership of the existing drilling teams but also to transfer and train a large number of reserve forces. Regarding the transfer of personnel, some units still have many concerns. They are afraid that production will be affected and accidents will occur. This year, many units in North China and East China have not equipped the drilling teams with sufficient high-quality cadres according to the intentions of the leading organs. Regarding the training of reserve forces, many people still emphasize objective difficulties. There are indeed difficulties. Some units do not have houses, and some units lack teachers and teaching materials... However, the task is urgent, and difficulties must be solved. We must oppose the idea of formalized schooling and must promote the practice of improvisation with a revolutionary spirit, and find ways to solve problems from multiple perspectives. If there are no houses, they can be borrowed. If there are insufficient teachers, they can be transferred. Existing training classes and technical schools can also take out part of their strength to do this work.

Second, we must concentrate the use of drilling rigs. According to the experience of the Northeast, concentrating the use of drilling rigs is an effective way to solve the contradiction between heavy tasks, urgent needs, and insufficient subjective forces. If drilling rigs are used in a decentralized manner, and exploration drilling is being done everywhere, and design cannot be carried out anywhere, this is harmful to the speed of our capital construction. Conversely, concentrated use of drilling rigs can quickly complete the required boreholes in an area and provide data for design. At the same time, in the past, when drilling rigs were used in a decentralized manner, drilling rigs were often tens of miles apart. Therefore, every time a drilling rig is moved, it is necessary to do the work of leveling the site, erecting the drilling platform, and installing the drilling rig... And these works are all done by the workers of this team themselves. As a result, each drilling rig drills for a maximum of 20 days per month. Most of the remaining time is spent on transferring drilling rigs and dismantling and erecting drilling towers. In addition, due to the dispersion of drilling rigs, management work is not easy to carry out, tools cannot be used interchangeably, and there are many difficulties in conducting political education for workers. In this way, it takes several years to complete the exploration work of a new area according to the requirements of the new design. This year, after the Northeast Coal Mine Administration adopted the method of concentrated use of drilling rigs, the situation has been greatly different, and the labor organization is more reasonable than before. Originally, it was a comprehensive class, and workers did everything, so the efficiency was naturally very low; at this time, it was changed to three shifts: preparation, drilling, and cleaning, which saved technicians and improved efficiency. Moreover, after the drilling rigs are concentrated, the mechanical repair shop can be transferred with the drilling rigs, and tools and machinery can be allocated to each other, so the utilization rate of the drilling rigs has been greatly improved, and each drilling rig transfer can save more than ten days. Management work and material supply work are also much more convenient.

Third, we must promote advanced experience to improve drilling efficiency. The Ma Wenzhi team has completed the task of drilling 2,500 meters in the third quarter of this year. All units should earnestly and thoroughly continue to promote this advanced experience. In the past, there were many drilling rig accidents, and on-site repairs were very time-consuming; after the drilling rigs are used in a concentrated manner, if each unit can prepare sufficient accessories, after an accident occurs, the broken parts can be replaced and sent to the factory for repair, and the drilling rig can continue to work. According to Ma Wenzhi and other advanced drilling workers, after adopting this method, an average of four hours of drilling time can be increased every day.

### 加紧培养后备力量，做好煤矿钻探工作

    加紧培养后备力量，做好煤矿钻探工作
    在中央燃料工业部最近召开的全国煤矿计划、基本建设会议上，已经明确指出，为了适应国家大规模经济建设的需要，必须立即把煤矿基本建设工作放在首要地位，而地质钻探工作又是煤矿基本建设的最重要最基本的准备工作。地下资源的情况不明，煤矿的基本建设工作就根本无法进行。明年的钻探任务很重，这一任务不但直接关系明年的，并且关系今后数年的煤矿基本建设工作的进展。
    目前我们的钻探工作状况是十分不能令人满意的，是煤矿基本建设中极为薄弱的一环。一般状况是：效率低、质量差、事故多。许多煤矿工作者在那里埋怨说任务大、钻机少。实际情况很明显，现有钻机的能力并没有很好地发挥。钻探工作的目的在于采取岩芯。但是，目前有些矿山只注意钻进进度，却不注意按时采取岩芯。以致有时虽然钻探进度提高了不少，但却没有足够的可供判断地下煤田情况的岩芯，有些地方不注意保管，不做好纪录，使已经取出的岩芯也不能发挥作用。钻机的事故频繁，已经严重地影响了钻探效率的提高。据东北各矿统计，因为事故而占去的时间约百分之三十。为什么上述这些问题不能迅速得到解决呢？除了客观困难外，基本原因还是由于有些领导干部没有真正认识到钻探工作的重要，因而没有立即把较强的干部配备到钻探部门去，没有以更多的精力来照顾钻探工作。有些单位还在等待着上级给想办法解决技术干部、技术工人不够的困难，认为一切条件都具备了才能使这一工作的面貌改变，而不肯积极主动地去克服困难创造条件。
    我们的钻探工作任务十分繁重，需要十分迫切，现有的钻探力量又十分薄弱，如何解决这个矛盾呢？
    首先，必须加强领导，大力培养后备力量。为着顺利地及时地完成明年的钻探计划，不仅需要加强现有的钻探队的领导，并且需要大批抽调和培养后备力量。关于抽调人员，目前有些单位还有许多顾虑。他们怕生产受到影响，怕发生事故。今年，华北、华东就有许多单位没有按照领导机关的意图给钻探队配备充足的质量较高的干部。关于培养后备力量，还有许多人强调客观困难。困难的确是有的，有的单位没有房子，有的单位缺少教员、教材……，但是任务是迫不及待的，困难一定要想办法解决。我们必须反对那种正规化办学的思想，必须以革命的精神提倡因陋就简的作法，从多方面想办法来解决问题，房子没有，可以借用，教员不足，可以抽调，现有的训练班和技术学校也可以拿出一部分力量来做这个工作。
    其次，必须集中使用钻机。根据东北的经验，集中使用钻机是解决目前任务繁重、需要急迫而主观力量不足这一矛盾的有效方法。假使钻机分散使用，处处都在探钻，处处都不能进行设计，这对我们基本建设的速度是有害的。相反的，钻机集中使用，就可以迅速地完成一个区域所需的钻孔，提出资料以便进行设计。同时，过去分散使用钻机时，钻机与钻机往往相距数十里。于是，每台钻机移动一次，都得把平场子、立钻台、安钻机……做一遍。而这些工作又都是由这一个队的工人自己干。结果，每台钻机每月的钻进时间最多二十天。其余的时间大多用于转移钻机，拆、立钻塔上面。另外，由于钻机分散，管理工作不好进行，工具无法互用，对于工人进行政治教育也有很多困难。这样，按照新的设计的要求完成一处新区的探查工作，就需要几年。今年，东北煤矿管理局采取了集中使用钻机的办法以后，情况就大大不同了，劳动组织比原来合理了。原来是一个综合班，工人什么都干，效率自然很低；这时改为准备、钻进、清理三个班，节省了技工，提高了效率。而且，钻机集中后，机械修理厂可以随钻机转移，用具、机械可以互相拨用，钻机利用率因而提高了很多，钻机转移每次可节省十天以上的时间。管理工作、材料供应工作也方便得多了。
    第三，必须推广先进经验以提高钻探效率。马文志小组在今年第三季已经完成了钻进二千五百公尺的任务。各单位应该认真地深入地继续推广这一先进经验。过去钻机事故多，在现场修理很费时间；在钻机集中使用后，各单位如果能够准备下充分的配件，在发生事故后，将坏了的零件换下送到工厂修理，钻机就可继续工作。据马文志和其他先进钻探工人说，采用这种办法后，平均每天可以增加四小时的钻进时间。
