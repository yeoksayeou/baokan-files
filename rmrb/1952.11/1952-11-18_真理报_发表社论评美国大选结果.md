Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 17th: The "Pravda" published an editorial on the 15th entitled "What the American Elections Show."

The editorial said: The results of the American election were a serious defeat for the Democratic Party and its presidential candidate, Stevenson. Republican candidate Eisenhower won a majority of the votes. However, if one analyzes the election results, it can be seen that although the general American public distrusts the Democratic Party, this by no means indicates that they are willing to follow the Republican Party to the end. Of the 98,400,000 voters, only 33,020,000 people voted for Eisenhower.

It must be remembered that the election campaign was conducted in an atmosphere of unprecedented nervous tension and brutal police terror. The special correspondent of the Swiss bourgeois newspaper "Lausanne Gazette" reported on November 4th: Twelve weeks of frantic propaganda and sleepless nights have turned ordinary American voters into a mass of playthings in the hands of radio commentators, journalists, and politicians, who, in the last few seconds before the election, stuffed voters' brains with dizzying sounds and slogans from both parties. New York police maintained order with revolvers. Federal police were frantically active.

In this election, devoid of any democracy, the Progressive Party, which advocated peace and democracy, was constantly subjected to abuse and persecution by American reactionaries.

The editorial pointed out: The failure of the Democratic Party, which has been in power for twenty years, is a direct result of the bankruptcy of the Truman Democratic government's entire foreign and domestic policy. The Truman government's policy of aggression and gambling has brought many difficulties to the American people and deprived them of many rights. The dissatisfaction of the broad masses of the American people with Truman's policies is constantly growing. They are increasingly loudly demanding an end to the war of aggression in Korea, the restoration of a policy of peace and international peaceful cooperation, and an end to the policy of plundering the working people and depriving the people of their freedom. However, the Truman government refused to heed these sentiments of the voters. Even in the middle of the election campaign, Democratic Party representatives made it clear that they were determined to continue the unpopular Korean War. This attitude could only alienate many voters who were very concerned about stopping the bloodshed in Korea from the Democrats.

Republican leaders seized upon this sentiment of the voters, and did their best to shift the responsibility for the Korean War to Truman and the Democratic Party. They desperately tried to conceal the fact that this war was the product of the "bipartisan" policy of the Democratic and Republican parties. The famous Republican foreign policy "expert" Dulles actively participated in launching this war.

Eisenhower, in view of the strong reaction at home and abroad to his warmongering clamor in the early stages of the campaign, changed his tune and tried to pose as a person who advocated a "peaceful solution to the Korean problem." In his speech in Pittsburgh on October 27, he even said that if he were elected, he would immediately go to Korea to study on the spot how to quickly and gloriously end the war there. American newspapers frankly stated in their comments on Eisenhower's trick that the Korean issue was Eisenhower's trump card in the election.

The editorial concluded: American voters voted for Eisenhower not so much because they supported Eisenhower as because they opposed Truman and his government, believing that Truman and his government were responsible for launching the Korean War, high prices, heavy taxes, and corruption and embezzlement in government agencies. Even bourgeois newspapers openly said that American voters had abandoned the Truman-Acheson policy.

### “真理报”发表社论评美国大选结果

    “真理报”发表社论评美国大选结果
    【新华社十七日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：“真理报”十五日发表社论，题目是“美国选举说明了什么问题”。
    社论说：美国选举结果是民主党及其总统候选人史蒂文森遭到严重失败，共和党候选人艾森豪威尔获得了多数票。但是，如果分析一下选举结果，就可以看出：虽然一般美国人不信任民主党，但这也绝不是说他们愿意追随共和党到底。在九千八百四十万选民里只有三千三百零二万多人投艾森豪威尔的票。
    必须记住：竞选运动是在空前的神经紧张和横暴的警察恐怖气氛中进行的。瑞士资产阶级报纸“洛桑日报”特派记者十一月四日报道说：十二个星期以来的疯狂宣传和夜晚不能入睡的情况，已经把美国普通选民变成了一大批无线电评论员、新闻记者和政客们手里的玩物，这些人在选举前最后几秒钟还在把使人头昏脑胀的声音和两党口号塞进选民的脑子里。纽约警察手执左轮手枪维持秩序。联邦警察狂热地活动着。
    在这种毫无民主可言的选举里，主张和平与民主的进步党一直受到美国反动势力的虐待和迫害。
    社论指出：执政二十年的民主党的失败，是杜鲁门的民主党政府整个外交内政政策破产的直接后果。杜鲁门政府的侵略和赌博政策给美国人民带来许多困难，使他们失掉许多权利。广大美国人民对杜鲁门政策的不满不断增长。他们日益响亮地要求结束侵略朝鲜的战争，要求恢复和平与国际和平合作的政策，要求停止实行掠夺劳动人民和剥夺人民自由的政策。但是，杜鲁门政府拒不理会选民的这些情绪。甚至在竞选中间，民主党代表还明白表示决心继续进行不得人心的朝鲜战争。这种态度只能使许多非常关心停止朝鲜流血的选民远离民主党人。
    共和党领袖们抓住了选民的这种情绪，竭力把朝鲜战争的责任推给杜鲁门和民主党，他们拼命掩饰这个战争原是民主党和共和党人的“两党”政策的产物，共和党著名的外交“专家”杜勒斯曾积极参与发动这个战争。
    艾森豪威尔鉴于在竞选初期的好战叫嚣引起国内外强烈的反感，就改变了论调，试图冒充一个主张“和平解决朝鲜问题”的人。十月二十七日他在匹兹堡发表的演说里甚至说，假如他当选他就要立刻到朝鲜去就地研究如何能迅速而又光荣地结束该地的战争。美国报纸在评论艾森豪威尔的这一诡计时坦白地说：朝鲜问题是艾森豪威尔在竞选中的王牌。
    社论最后说：美国选民之所以投艾森豪威尔的票，与其说是因为他们拥护艾森豪威尔，不如说是他们反对杜鲁门及其政府，他们认为杜鲁门及其政府要对发动朝鲜战争、物价高涨、赋税沉重和政府机关的腐败贪污负责。甚至资产阶级报纸也公开说，美国选民已经唾弃了杜鲁门—艾奇逊政策。
