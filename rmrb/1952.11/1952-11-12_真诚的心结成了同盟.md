Sincere Hearts Form an Alliance

Soviet writer, Stalin Prize winner Lief Cassill

I will always remember that night... It was already very late. My family members had already gone to sleep. An urgent task kept me tied to my desk. Suddenly, the doorbell at the entrance rang. I went to open the door, but as soon as I unlatched it, the door was pushed open, and my friend, the poet Sergei Mikhalkov, stepped into the front room. He is one of our country's most beloved children's poets. His delightful poems for children and adults are known to millions. He is a playwright and the author of the Soviet national anthem.

My friend was very excited. He burst into our quiet house in a flurry, quickly took off his coat, and immediately hugged me, dragging me into the study. Before I could ask him why he was visiting me at this late hour, Mikhalkov said:

"Do you know where I've just been! In short, do you know what happened in the world today?" He didn't let me think calmly, but grabbed my shoulders, pushed me into an armchair, and sat down opposite me, then jumped up again and strode around the room, his joyful excitement making it impossible for him to sit still. He said:

"I just attended the reception celebrating the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship. The signing ceremony took place in the Kremlin today. I saw Comrade Stalin and Mao Zedong. I saw them standing together, side by side. Do you understand! ... I just came from there. How could I not wake you up? I had to tell you."

My friend and I stayed up all night, feeling that this immense and joyful excitement would prevent either of us from sleeping anyway. Mikhalkov repeatedly recounted what he had seen and heard at this historically significant evening. We talked about Chinese literature, took Lu Xun's selected works from the bookshelf... We continued to talk and think about how delighted and enthusiastic all the honest and sincere hearts in the world would be about the great alliance treaty concluded between the world's two great nations, with a population of about 700 million!

I have recalled this night more than once. I also thought of it when I met Chinese young pioneers at the "Artek" summer camp on the Black Sea coast in Crimea. Recently, on the eve of the opening of the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, I once again recalled everything mentioned above.

On the day before the opening of the congress, Comrade Stalin's new book "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR" went on sale in Moscow bookstores. Although Comrade Stalin's work had only been published in "Pravda" the day before, the kiosks and bookstores were crowded with people buying the book... In the bookstore where I went to buy the book, people who hoped to get a copy in order to study Comrade Stalin's brilliant new work in detail had already lined up. Three young Chinese comrades were also in line. They could already explain themselves reasonably well in Russian, asking the people in front of them if there were any copies of Comrade Stalin's book available. At that moment, everyone stepped aside slightly, warmly inviting the Chinese comrades to go to the counter displaying Comrade Stalin's books.

"Comrades, please go and get it, you don't need to queue," the people around said.

"The more you tell the people in your country about Comrade Stalin's work, the greater the benefit to your people and our people..."

After a while, the young Chinese comrades came out of the bookstore, reading the book by Comrade Stalin they had just bought as they walked.

We looked at them with beautiful and kind smiles:

"Good people, reliable friends!"

    真诚的心结成了同盟
    苏联作家、斯大林奖金获得者  莱夫·卡锡尔
    我永远记得这天的夜里……那已经是很晚的时候。我的家人们早已睡觉了。一件紧急的工作叫我离不开写字台。突然，入口处的门上的铃声响了起来。我走去开门，但刚刚打开门闩，门一下子就打开了，我的朋友，诗人塞尔格伊·米哈尔柯夫走进了前屋，他是我国最受人民爱戴的儿童诗歌作家之一，他为儿童、为成年人所写的那些愉快的诗歌，是千千万万人都知道的，他是剧作家，是苏联国歌的作者。
    我的朋友非常激动。他稀里哗哩地闯进我们宁静的房子，很快脱下了大衣，一下子就抱着我，把我拖到工作室。我还没有来得及问他为什么要在这个深夜的时分来访问我，米哈尔柯夫自己就说了：
    “你知道我刚才在什么地方！总而言之，你知不知道今天世界上发生了什么事？”他没让我冷静地想一想，就抓住我的肩，推我坐在圈椅上，他自己坐在对面，然后又跳起来在房里跨着大步走来走去，那愉快的兴奋劲儿简直不能叫他在一个地方安静地坐一会。他说：
    “我刚刚参加了庆祝苏联与人民中国友好条约签字的招待会。今天在克里姆林宫举行了签字仪式。我刚才看见了斯大林同志和毛泽东。我看见他们站在一起，在一块儿。你明白吗！……我刚从那儿来的。我能不叫醒你吗？我不能不告诉你呀。”
    我和我的朋友坐了一个通宵，觉得这股巨大的愉快的兴奋劲儿反正不能叫我们两人睡觉。米哈尔柯夫一次又一次地讲着他在这个富有历史意义的晚会上看到和听到的东西。我们谈到中国的文学，从书架上取下了鲁迅选集……我们继续谈着、想着，全世界一切正直和真诚的心，对于这约有七亿人口的世界上两个伟大民族缔结了伟大的友好同盟条约，会有多么愉快而热烈的反响！
    我不止一次回想起这一个夜晚。当我在黑海岸边，在克里米亚的“阿尔杰克”夏令营遇见中国的少年儿童队员们时，我也想到它。最近不久，在苏联共产党十九次代表会议开幕前夜，我又一次回想到上面所说的一切。
    代表大会开幕的前一天，斯大林同志的新书“苏联社会主义经济问题”在莫斯科各个书店里出售了。虽然斯大林同志的著作离“真理报”发表的时候不过一天，可是各个书亭和书店都挤满了买书的人……在我去买书的一家书店中，那些为了要详细研究斯大林同志的这部天才的新著作而希望得到一本书的人们，已经站好了队。有三位年轻的中国同志也排到队里来了。看起来他们都是大学生。他们已经可以不算坏地用俄文说明自己的意思，问站在前面的人们有没有斯大林同志的书可买。那时大家都稍稍往旁边退了一步，亲切地让中国同志走到摆着斯大林同志著的书的柜台边去。
    “同志们，请走过去拿吧，你们不用排队了。”周围的人们说。
    “你们愈是把斯大林同志的这部著作，告诉你们国内的人，对于你们人民和我们人民的好处便愈大……”
    过了一会儿，年轻的中国同志从书店里走出来了，他们边走边翻阅着刚刚买到的斯大林同志著的书。
    我们带着美好而亲切的微笑望着他们：
    “很好的人民，可靠的朋友！”
