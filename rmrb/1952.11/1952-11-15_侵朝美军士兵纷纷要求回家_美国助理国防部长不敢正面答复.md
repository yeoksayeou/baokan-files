Xinhua News Agency, November 12th: American news agencies reveal that Mrs. Rosenberg, the U.S. Assistant Secretary of Defense mainly responsible for manpower affairs of the U.S. military, flew to the Korean front on the 9th for an "inspection." Mrs. Rosenberg's visit to the Korean front reflects the U.S. military authorities' unease about the heavy losses, difficulty in replenishment, and low morale of the U.S. troops.

During Mrs. Rosenberg's inspection at the front, American soldiers reflected this war-weary and homesick mood wherever she went. According to an Associated Press dispatch on the 9th, "All the soldiers who talked to her" reflected that "their main suffering seemed to be wanting to go home." One American soldier asked her, "What's the news about going home for Christmas?"

Mrs. Rosenberg, of course, dared not directly answer the soldiers' urgent demands to end the war as soon as possible. She only made empty promises to "send some replacement troops"; at the same time, she shamelessly "promised to send some 'blonde and blue-eyed beautiful women' and also said she would ask to send some swarthy beauties."

The promises made by Mrs. Rosenberg at the front demonstrate the embarrassment of the U.S. military authorities in the face of heavy losses, difficulty in replenishment, and low morale, unable to find a way out; it also reflects how shamefully degenerate the U.S. rulers have become, even attempting to seduce U.S. soldiers with pornography to continue selling their lives at the front.

    侵朝美军士兵纷纷要求回家
    美国助理国防部长不敢正面答复
    【新华社十二日讯】美国通讯社透露：主要负责美军人力方面事务的美国助理国防部长罗森堡夫人，在九日飞抵朝鲜前线“视察”。罗森堡夫人的到朝鲜视察，反映了美国军事当局对于美军损失惨重、补充困难、士气低沉的情形的不安。
    罗森堡夫人在前线视察时，所到之处，美国士兵们都反映出了这种厌战思家的情绪。据美联社九日电透露：“凡是和她谈过话的兵士”都反映出“他们的主要的痛苦似乎是想回家”。有一个美国兵问她：“关于回家过圣诞节的消息究竟怎样？”
    罗森堡夫人当然不敢正面回答士兵们表示的希望早日结束战争的迫切要求，她只是空口允诺：“要派遣一些接替军队”；同时，她无耻地“答应说要派一些‘金发碧眼的漂亮女人’来，并且说还要要求派一些浅黑型的美女来。”
    罗森堡夫人在前线所作的诺言，说明了美国军事当局在损失惨重、补充困难、士气低沉的情形下，力不从心、找不到出路的窘态；也反映出美国统治者已无耻堕落到何等地步，竟企图以色情来诱骗美军士兵继续在前线卖命。
