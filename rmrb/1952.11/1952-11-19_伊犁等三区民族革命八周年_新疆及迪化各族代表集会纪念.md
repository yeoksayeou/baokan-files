    大会主席赛福鼎讲述了三区革命的重大意义。He pointed out: The Three Districts National Revolution was a revolution of jointly resisting the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang and resisting imperialist aggression together with the people of the whole country. In September 1949, the convergence of the Chinese People's Revolution and the Three Districts National Revolution enabled the people of Xinjiang to be liberated and realize the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. Today, the people of Xinjiang have begun a happy life under the leadership of the great leader Chairman Mao. He said: Although there were shortcomings in the Three Districts National Revolutionary Movement, mainly due to the lack of leadership from the Chinese Communist Party, the revolution suffered many twists and turns. However, this revolutionary movement has given us great experience and lessons, especially today we have a deeper understanding that the destiny of the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang is closely linked with the destiny of the people of the whole country. The revolutionary cause of the people of Xinjiang can only achieve complete victory if it is carried out jointly with the revolutionary cause of the people of the whole country. Finally, he called on comrades who participated in the Three Districts Revolution to strive for the victorious completion of the land reform movement under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and with the help of veteran cadres from the interior, and to welcome the large-scale economic construction of the motherland.

    中共中央新疆分局书记王恩茂代表新疆分局对三区民族革命八周年纪念表示热烈祝贺。Wang Enmao, Secretary of the Xinjiang Branch of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, extended warm congratulations on the eighth anniversary of the Three Districts National Revolution on behalf of the Xinjiang Branch. He pointed out: On September 25, 1949, Xinjiang announced a peaceful uprising, and the Chinese People's Liberation Army marched into Xinjiang and merged with the Three Districts National Revolutionary Armed Forces. From that time on, Xinjiang was completely liberated, and the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang began to live in the great family of the People's Republic of China under the leadership of the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao. Since then, the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang have ended national oppression and truly begun a life of national equality, mutual assistance, friendship, and happiness. This is the result of the long-term struggle of the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang and under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao. He finally pointed out: Now the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang have launched a great land reform movement in vast agricultural areas. This movement will completely change the face of Xinjiang society and will create conditions for large-scale economic and cultural construction in Xinjiang. Therefore, on this day of commemorating the eighth anniversary of the Three Districts National Revolution, the task of the people of all ethnic groups is to concentrate all forces to complete the great land reform movement, that is, to prepare for the completion of large-scale economic construction and cultural construction, and to strive for building a happy life for the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang.

    伊犁等三区民族革命八周年
    新疆及迪化各族代表集会纪念
    据新华社讯：新疆省及迪化市各族各界代表六百余人，十二日在迪化天山大厦集会，纪念伊犁、塔城、阿山三区民族革命八周年。
    大会主席赛福鼎讲述了三区革命的重大意义。他指出：三区民族革命是和全国人民共同反抗国民党反动统治，反抗帝国主义侵略的革命。一九四九年九月，中国人民革命和三区民族革命的汇合，使新疆人民得到了解放，实现了中国共产党的领导。今天，新疆人民在伟大领袖毛主席领导下已开始了幸福的生活。他说：三区民族革命运动虽然存在着缺点，主要是没有中国共产党的领导，使革命遭受了不少曲折。但这一革命运动给了我们很大的经验教训，特别是今天更深刻地体会到，新疆各族人民的命运，是和全国人民的命运紧紧联系在一起的。新疆人民的革命事业，只有和全国人民革命事业共同进行，才能得到彻底胜利。最后他号召曾参加三区革命的同志们，今天应该在中国共产党的领导下，在内地老干部的帮助下，争取土地改革运动胜利完成，迎接祖国大规模的经济建设。
    中共中央新疆分局书记王恩茂代表新疆分局对三区民族革命八周年纪念表示热烈祝贺。他指出：一九四九年九月二十五日，新疆宣布和平起义，中国人民解放军向新疆进军，与三区民族革命武装汇合了。从这时起新疆就完全解放了，新疆各族人民，开始生活在中国各民族人民的伟大领袖毛主席领导下的中华人民共和国的大家庭中了。从此，新疆各族人民就结束了民族压迫，真正开始了民族平等、互助、友爱、幸福的生活。这是新疆各族人民长期奋斗和在中国共产党、毛主席领导下得到的结果。他最后指出：现在新疆各族人民已在广大的农业地区展开了伟大的土地改革运动，这个运动将会彻底改变新疆社会的面貌；将会为新疆大规模的经济建设和文化建设创造条件。因此，我们纪念三区民族革命八周年的今天，各族人民的任务就是要集中一切力量，完成伟大的土地改革运动，那就是为完成大规模的经济建设、文化建设作好准备工作，为建设新疆各族人民幸福的生活而奋斗。
