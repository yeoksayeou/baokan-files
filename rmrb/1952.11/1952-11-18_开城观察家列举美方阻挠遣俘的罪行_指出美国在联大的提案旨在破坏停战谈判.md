Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, November 16th: According to well-informed observers here, the United States' attempt to have the United Nations General Assembly adopt its proposal aimed at detaining prisoners of war is to prevent the resumption of armistice talks and to make the already interrupted negotiations fall apart. Korean peace hangs by a thread, but Washington, fearing the realization of the armistice, is trying hard to break this fine thread.

These observers pointed out that the armistice was so close that just as General Nam Il was putting forward a new proposal to break the deadlock, Washington had to order Harrison to interrupt the fifteen-month-long negotiations. Clark was ordered to refuse to resume the interrupted negotiations, and Washington is now ordering its vassal states in the United Nations General Assembly to force through the U.S. proposal aimed at prolonging and expanding the war, in order to close the door to resuming negotiations.

The United States is using the most despicable and shameless deceptive means in the United Nations General Assembly to keep the war going so that American billionaires can continue to make big money. American representatives and their echoers are again repeating the hypocritical lie that the war must continue because they cannot "forcibly repatriate prisoners of war." But the fact that the whole world clearly sees is that for months, unarmed Korean and Chinese prisoners of war have been subjected to continuous bloody massacres by American guns, artillery and flamethrower tanks. Clark has threatened to use force against prisoners of war who continue to express their willingness to return home. From what he said, the crime of this bloody massacre of prisoners of war will continue.

The U.S. side fabricated the lie that prisoners of war would be "executed or punished" after repatriation, and used this as an excuse to push the long-awaited armistice out of sight. But the U.S. military command has not dared to deny so far that it had coerced some Korean and Chinese prisoners of war into espionage activities. The U.S. side threatened these prisoners of war that if they escaped back home, the American radio station would broadcast their espionage activities. Now, these prisoners of war who were forced to engage in espionage activities and the American pilot Harrison who airdropped them are now in the hands of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers.

In fact, every excuse put forward by the U.S. side for refusing to repatriate prisoners of war was refuted by the Korean and Chinese representatives at Panmunjom long ago. General Nam Il's proposal clearly stated that the joint Red Cross group would ensure that prisoners of war could return home to live peaceful lives. As for those prisoners of war who were forced to tattoo shameful slogans or were forced to write articles that made them afraid to return home, the spokesmen of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers said in April this year that they were not responsible for these actions. The spokesman said: We have guaranteed in the agreement with the other side that all captured personnel will be reunited with their families after repatriation, participate in peaceful construction, and live peaceful lives.

Even Senator Wiley of the U.S. delegation had to admit that "voluntary repatriation" or "non-forcible repatriation" had no basis in international law. In his "Voice of America" broadcast, he admitted that the drafting process of the Geneva Convention showed that the proposal regarding "prohibiting the detaining country from repatriating prisoners who are unwilling to return" was "not adopted." He had to re-advance the argument that detaining prisoners of war was to give them a "haven," but this argument was refuted by General Nam Il at Panmunjom long ago. General Nam Il pointed out to the speechless Harrison: No provision in the Geneva Convention allows prisoners of war and political prisoners to be confused. Any country that does not want to tear up the Geneva Convention cannot tolerate your so-called "haven" excuse for detaining prisoners of war.

In order to continue to drive hundreds of thousands of American, British, and other countries' soldiers to their deaths, the U.S. side does not hesitate to fabricate the most untenable excuses. The most absurd excuse they recently fabricated is that it would be a "dishonorable" thing to fulfill the solemn obligation of the Geneva Convention, which is signed by most countries in the world, to repatriate all prisoners of war. The imperialists' so-called honor is obviously to tear up solemn agreements in order to launch wars of aggression.

The whole world sees it too clearly: Acheson and the U.S. delegation to the United Nations General Assembly are using talk of "humanity" as a cover for their inhuman activities of letting the bloodshed in Korea continue and preventing prisoners of war on both sides from returning home.

### 开城观察家列举美方阻挠遣俘的罪行  指出美国在联大的提案旨在破坏停战谈判

    开城观察家列举美方阻挠遣俘的罪行
    指出美国在联大的提案旨在破坏停战谈判
    【新华社开城十六日电】据此间消息灵通的观察家说：美国企图使联合国大会通过它的旨在拘留战俘的提案，是为了不让停战谈判恢复，并使已经中断了的谈判陷于破裂。朝鲜和平已系于一发，可是华盛顿生怕停战实现，正在努力想把这一根细发拉断。
    这些观察家指出：停战是这样地十分逼近，以致正当南日将军为了打开僵局而提出一项新建议时，华盛顿不得不命令哈利逊中断历时十五个月的谈判。克拉克奉命拒绝恢复中断了的谈判，华盛顿现在正在命令它在联合国大会中的附庸国家强行通过旨在延长和扩大战争的美国提案，以关闭恢复谈判之门。
    美国正在联合国大会上使用最卑鄙无耻的欺骗手段，以使战争继续进行，好让美国亿万富翁继续赚大钱。美国代表及其应声虫再度重复这样一种虚伪的谎言：战争必须继续下去，因为他们不能“强迫遣返战俘”。但是全世界清楚看到的事实是：在几个月以来，手无寸铁的朝中战俘曾连续不断地受到美国枪炮和喷火坦克的血腥屠杀。克拉克已扬言要对继续表示愿意回家的战俘使用武力，从他说的话看来，这种血腥屠杀战俘的罪行还要继续下去。
    美方制造战俘们遣返后“将被处死或受惩罚”的谎言，并以此为藉口，把全世界期待已久的停战推到九霄云外。但是美军司令部至今还不敢否认它曾威逼一些朝中战俘进行间谍活动。美方威胁这些战俘说，如果他们逃回家去，美国电台就要广播他们的间谍活动。现在，这些被迫作间谍活动的战俘和把他们空投下来的美国驾驶员哈里森现在都在朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军手中。
    事实上，美方所提出的每一项不肯遣返战俘的藉口，都在很久以前就被朝中代表在板门店驳倒了。南日将军的建议清楚地说明，红十字会联合小组将保证战俘能够回家过和平生活。至于那些被迫刺了可耻的口号或被强迫书写使他们不敢回家的文章的战俘，朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军发言人在今年四月就已说过，他们对于这些行为没有责任。这个发言人说：我们并已在与对方的协议中，保证全部被俘人员在遣返后将与其家人团聚、参加和平建设事业，并过和平生活。
    甚至美国代表团中的参议员维利，都不得不承认“自愿遣返”或“不强迫遣返”在国际法上是没有根据的。他在“美国之音”的广播中承认，日内瓦公约的制订过程显示，关于“禁止拘留国遣返不愿意回去的俘虏”的建议“未被采纳”。他不得不重新提出拘留战俘是为了给他们一个“避难所”的论据，可是这种论据在很久以前就被南日将军在板门店驳倒了。南日将军向哑口无言的哈利逊指出：日内瓦公约中没有一项条款容许把战俘和政治犯混为一谈。只要是不愿意撕毁日内瓦公约的国家，都不能容忍你方为了拘留战俘而提出的所谓“避难所”的藉口。
    为了继续驱使成千成万的美国、英国以及其他国家的士兵去送死，美方不惜捏造最站不住脚的藉口。他们最近制造的荒谬绝伦的藉口是：如果履行有世界上大多数国家签署的规定遣返全部战俘的日内瓦公约的庄严义务，那将是一件“不光荣”的事。帝国主义者的所谓光荣显然是撕毁庄严的协定，以发动侵略战争。
    全世界看得太清楚了：艾奇逊和参加联合国大会的美国代表团正在以侈谈“人道”做幌子，进行他们那种让朝鲜的流血继续下去和不让双方战俘回家的惨无人道的勾当。
