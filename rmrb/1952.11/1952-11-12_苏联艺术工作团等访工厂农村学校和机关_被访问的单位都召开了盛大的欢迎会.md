Xinhua News Agency, 10th: Some members of the Soviet Art Troupe and the Soviet Cultural Workers Delegation visited factories, rural villages, schools, and government offices in Beijing on the 10th. Chulaki, Vice Chairman of the Art Committee of the Soviet Council of Ministers, and Soviet violinist Kogan, magician Chitoshvili, and piano accompanist Metnik visited the Changxindian Railway Factory and Huangtugang Village in the southern suburbs. Grusenko, Academic Secretary of the Soviet Academy of Sciences and biologist, and Soviet famous ballet dancer Ulanova, puppet theater art director Obraztsov, and four others visited Beijing No. 12 Girls' Middle School and Peking University. Soviet singer Halima Nasyrova, Nechayev, ballet dancers Sokolova and Pomazkov visited the Shijingshan Power Plant and Yamenkou Village. Singer Pebtov, Moscow State Circus performers Karacheva and Puchitzen, and two others visited the first department of the High School Affiliated to Beijing Normal University and the People's Printing Factory. Tamara Hanon, an Uzbek singer and dancer from the Soviet Union, her accompanists Dadajanov, Bakayev, Ajimov, and Salnikov, an administrative staff member of the Soviet Art Troupe, visited the Beijing Power Supply Bureau and the Beijing University School of Medicine.

The Soviet friends were warmly welcomed by the masses everywhere. The visited units all held grand welcome meetings. Everywhere, people shouted "Stalin - Mao Zedong!" People presented flowers to the Soviet friends and gave them their beloved gifts. The farmers of Huangtugang's gifts were peanuts, sweet potatoes, and corn produced in their own fields. Liu Yingyuan, a labor model of the Shijingshan Power Plant, gave Halima Nasyrova a commemorative medal issued by the Beijing Sino-Soviet Friendship Association for promoting Soviet advanced experience; labor model Li Jinquan gave Sokolova a commemorative medal for repairing the blast furnace in 1951. Chulaki said while accepting the gifts, "The most precious gift in the world is something earned through one's own labor, like these peanuts." Halima Nasyrova said that she would keep this medal for the rest of her life. Students from Beijing No. 12 Girls' Middle School gave the Soviet friends an enemy illumination parachute that the Chinese People's Volunteers had sent them, captured from the Korean battlefield. Workers at the People's Printing Factory gave the Soviet friends more than 20 albums of scenic spots in the capital that they had carved and printed. The gifts were varied, but every peanut and every picture equally contained the friendship and love of the millions of Chinese people for the Soviet elder brother.

Everywhere, people performed programs to welcome the Soviet friends. The performers were not professional actors, but people tried their best to perform their best music and dance for the distinguished guests. The farmers of Huangtugang performed the farmers' favorite Wenchang and Lion Dance. People were beating waist drums and wearing new clothes. Everyone welcomed the Soviet friends as if it were a holiday.

This was the first time everyone had met these Soviet friends, but as soon as they met, they were like old friends of many years. Everyone talked cordially together. Yin Weichen, director of the agricultural production cooperative in Huangtugang Village and a Beijing labor model, told the Soviet friends how he used to be a hired laborer, eating chaff and vegetables, and suffering from the oppression of the landlords; now he has been emancipated. He told the Soviet friends how his production cooperative applied the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, and today the yield of potatoes was 5,123 jin per mu, which is more than one and a half times the local average level. The cabbage also had a bumper harvest this year. Today, more than 120 mu of wheat were also planted using the Soviet wheat close-planting method. He was elected as a model and won a prize - a large donkey, a prize flag, and a medal. He said that in the future, he would use machines to cultivate the land and follow the path of collectivization like the Soviet Union. Ling Biying, an old worker at the People's Printing Factory, told Pebtov how the Soviet expert Sokolinikov helped them install the engraving machine and train technical cadres. Worker Li Yitian told Bubenin how they improved the operation method with the help of Soviet expert Sokolinikov, saving more than 100 man-hours every day. When the workers saw that the production targets were exceeded, and when the farmers ate the bumper potatoes, they would think of the Soviet elder brother. Today, they had the opportunity to talk to the Soviet friends about their daily lives, and their excitement was indescribable.

The Soviet friends felt the same way as everyone else. Chulaki said at the welcome meeting in Huangtugang Village: "We have come from a very far place, but we feel like we are at home on Chinese soil. Because we see here that the liberated people are creating their own lives with their own hands." He said that the Soviet people have traveled a difficult road for 35 years, and the Chinese people will complete it in a shorter time. Because China is not isolated, but is building with the support of the powerful Soviet Union.

This cordial visit and welcome, this deep and great friendship, left an indelible impression on people.

    苏联艺术工作团等访工厂农村学校和机关
    被访问的单位都召开了盛大的欢迎会
    【新华社十日讯】苏联艺术工作团和苏联文化工作者代表团的部分人员，十日分别访问了北京的工厂、农村、学校和机关。苏联部长会议艺术委员会副主席楚拉基和苏联提琴家柯岗，魔术家契托希维利和钢琴伴奏家梅特尼克访问了长辛店铁路工厂和南郊黄土岗村。苏联科学院学术秘书、生物学家格鲁森科和苏联著名巴蕾舞演员乌兰诺娃，木偶戏剧院艺术指导奥布拉兹卓夫等六人访问了北京市第十二女子中学和北京大学。苏联歌唱家哈利马·纳赛罗娃，聂恰耶夫，巴蕾舞演员索科洛娃和波马兹科夫访问了石景山发电厂和衙门口村。歌唱家裴布托夫，莫斯科国家杂技团演员卡拉巧娃和普奇岑等四人访问了北京师范大学附属中学第一部和人民印刷厂。苏联艺术家塔马拉·哈侬的乌兹别克歌舞伴奏者达达让诺夫，巴卡耶夫，阿吉莫夫和苏联艺术工作团行政工作人员萨尔尼柯夫访问了北京电业局和北京大学医学院。
    苏联友人在各处都受到群众的热烈欢迎。被访问的单位都召开了盛大的欢迎会。处处高呼着“斯大林——毛泽东！”人们向苏联友人献花，并把自己心爱的礼物送给他们。黄土岗农民的礼物是自己地里出产的花生、红薯和玉米。石景山发电厂的劳动模范刘英源把北京市中苏友好协会发的推广苏联先进经验纪念章送给了哈利马·纳赛罗娃；劳动模范李金泉把一九五一年抢修高炉的纪念章送给了索科洛娃。楚拉基在接受礼物时说：“世界上最宝贵的礼物就是像这些花生那样自己劳动所得的东西。”哈利马·纳赛罗娃说，她要把这个纪念章一生一世保存起来。北京第十二女子中学的学生把中国人民志愿军送给她们的、从朝鲜战场上缴获的敌人照明降落伞转送了苏联朋友。人民印刷厂的工人把自己雕刻和印制的二十多本首都名胜画册送给苏联友人。礼物是多种多样的，但是每一颗花生、每一张画片都同样包含着千千万万中国人民对苏联老大哥的友情和热爱。
    在各处，人们表演节目欢迎苏联友人。表演的人都不是职业演员，但是人们尽量把自己最好的音乐和舞蹈表演给贵宾看。黄土岗的农民表演了农民最喜爱的文场和狮子会。人们敲着腰鼓，穿着新衣服。大家像过节日一样来接待苏联友人。
    大家还是第一次会见这些苏联朋友，但是一见面就像多年的老朋友一样。大家在一起亲切地谈话。黄土岗村农业生产合作社主任、北京市劳动模范殷维臣告诉苏联友人，他过去怎样当长工，吃糠咽菜，受尽地主的压迫；今天翻身了。他告诉苏联友人，他的生产合作社怎样应用了苏联的先进经验，土豆今天每亩收了五千一百二十三斤，超过当地一般水平的一倍半。白菜今年也丰收了。今天还用苏联的小麦密植法种了一百二十多亩小麦。他怎样被选为模范，得了奖——一只大驴子和一面奖旗、一枚奖章。他说将来要用机器耕种，和苏联一样走上集体化的道路。人民印刷厂的老工人凌必应告诉裴布托夫，苏联专家索克里尼克夫怎样帮助他们安装雕刻机和培养技术干部。工人李义田告诉布别宁，他们怎样在苏联专家索克里尼克夫帮助下改进了操作方法，每天节省一百多人工。当工人们看到生产指标超过计划的时候，农民们吃着丰产的土豆的时候，都会想到苏联老大哥。今天他们有机会和苏联友人谈谈家常，兴奋的心情是难以形容的。
    苏联友人的心情是和大家一样的。楚拉基在黄土岗村的欢迎大会上说：“我们从很遥远的地方来，但是我们在中国土地上就像在自己家里一样。因为我们在这里看到解放了的人民用自己的手创造着自己的生活。”他说，苏联人民艰苦地走了三十五年的道路，中国人民将在更短的时间内走完它。因为中国不是孤立的，而是在强大的苏联的支持下进行建设的。
    这次亲切的访问和欢迎，这种深厚的、伟大的友谊，给人们留下不可磨灭的印象。
