An Evening with Comrade Fedorov: Head of the Soviet Film Art Workers Delegation

Having just arrived in Beijing, Comrade Fedorov, head of the Soviet film art workers delegation, despite his fatigue after returning from a report at the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant in the suburbs of Beijing, warmly received the visiting reporter one evening.

He began by excitedly sharing his impressions of China. He said that when their plane landed on Chinese soil, the warm welcome and sincere love of the Chinese people deeply moved them. He said, "When we return to our country, we will definitely bring back the enthusiasm and friendship of the Chinese people, and we will definitely tell our people about the joyous and inspiring construction of their motherland by the Chinese people." Comrade Fedorov particularly mentioned his love for Chairman Mao, saying, "I felt so happy to be able to shake hands firmly with Chairman Mao, the great leader of the Chinese people. On the day of the 'Sino-Soviet Friendship Month' celebration party, I sat with Chairman Mao and spoke with him, which made me feel proud."

Then, he began to answer the reporter's questions. Talking about the development of the Soviet film industry, Comrade Fedorov said, "Film in our country has a history of fifty years, but before the October Revolution, film, like factories, was in the hands of capitalists. At that time, the capitalists used film to obtain profits, to fool the people, and to maintain their rule. After the victory of our people in the October Revolution of 1917, a new path was opened up in Russian film art. Our Party and government and the great leader Comrade Lenin attached great importance to the film industry, considering Soviet film art as the most important and popular art form. In 1919, our country, under Lenin's personal signature, issued a decree 'on the transfer of national photography and film industry to the management of the People's Education Committee.' From then on, the Soviet people's national film industry was born."

On the road to the development of Soviet film, the Soviet Communist Party and the Soviet government gave the greatest care. Comrade Fedorov said, "Before the revolution, the Russian film industry mostly relied on foreign countries. At that time, we could not manufacture cameras, and we had to import them from Britain and France, which cost us a very high price. After the revolution, our Party and government raised this issue and helped filmmakers organize film studios. And established the film industry."

People know that in the early days of the establishment of the Soviet regime, the Soviet people waged a very fierce struggle against the aggression of foreign capitalism against the young Soviet Union and against the rebellion of domestic White bandits. It was at that time that the Soviet people began to use film to protest against foreign interventionists and to use film as a weapon to fight against the enemy. Comrade Fedorov said, "From that time on, we first developed newsreels. Our photographers went to the front lines to record the heroic struggle of our people's army against the White bandits. At that time, great and authentic shots of the great leader Lenin were filmed, so that we can still vividly see the heroic image of our leader today, twenty-eight years later. At that time, our photographers not only filmed on the front lines, but also filmed the heroic construction of factories by our people in the rear. In this way, the film mobilized the people to fight the enemy. From that time on, the production of propaganda films began to be widely promoted. After documentaries, we produced cultural and educational films. After the First World War, our country's economy was destroyed, and diseases were very prevalent. We shot many films on epidemic prevention and medical treatment."

"In 1920, we began to produce silent feature films (story films). At that time, we produced many films, among which the most outstanding films were Eisenstein's 'Battleship Potemkin' and the film 'Mother' adapted from Gorky's novel. The former depicts the heroic struggle of Russian sailors in 1915; the latter is a film about the great mother of the Russian people.

"From 1930, we already had very good film equipment. We began to produce sound films. The emergence of sound films further promoted film art to the masses." From then on, the powerful Bolshevik language resounded on the Soviet screen. From 1931, the Soviet Union completely stopped silent films. It was also from that time that Soviet films began to achieve great success. In those years, some very outstanding films were made, such as "Chapaev", "The Maxim Trilogy", "Lenin in October", "Lenin in 1918", "Party Card", "The Great Citizen", etc. In those years, the Soviet film industry developed very rapidly, and both news documentaries and science education films began to develop. At the same time, large-scale film studios and film machinery factories were established.

In 1941, when the Hitler bandits attacked the Soviet Union, the Soviet people heroically rose up to defend their motherland, and all filmmakers also rose up to resist the enemy. Comrade Fedorov told us that at that time, many photographers went to the front line to film the heroic deeds of the front-line soldiers fighting the enemy, and some of these photographers sacrificed their lives at their battle stations. During the war years, the Soviet Union also produced many excellent films, such as "Zoya", "Rainbow", "The Great Turning Point", etc., which reflected the great wartime reality and mobilized the broad masses of people to carry out a sacred struggle against the enemy.

After the end of the Patriotic War, the Soviet Union began to shift to a period of peaceful construction. Soviet filmmakers mobilized all their forces to more deeply portray the heroism of the Soviet people in the Great Patriotic War, and how the Soviet people carried out recovery and construction in peaceful times, and made excellent films such as "The Battle of Stalingrad", "The Oath", "The Fall of Berlin", "Donbas Miners", "Hero of the Golden Star", "Happy Life", etc.

"Our transition from a wartime environment to a peaceful environment was not without obstacles," Comrade Fedorov continued, "because at that time, some of our filmmakers could not very well express the great and noble qualities of the Soviet people. They were not good at portraying the Soviet people who were victorious, and they could not very well understand the Soviet people who were victors, so they also made some films with weaker ideologies. However, the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party promptly discovered and pointed out these mistakes of the filmmakers. The decision on the film 'The Great Life' in 1946 pointed out the correct creative path for films. After the war, we quickly restored the film industry and quickly surpassed the pre-war level. Now, not only in Moscow and Leningrad, but also in the capital of every Union Republic, there is a film studio. After the war, we built our film industry on a new technical basis. This gave us the power to create color films. Now, most of the feature films, newsreels, documentaries, and newsreels are shot in color." Speaking here, Comrade Fedorov happily told the reporter: "We are very happy that the films screened in China this time are all in color. These films show that after the war, we developed our film industry on a new industrial basis according to Comrade Stalin's instructions."

When we talked about how Soviet films serve to defend world peace and communist construction, Comrade Fedorov said:

"In our country, there is a law that does not exist in any capitalist country, that is, it is absolutely forbidden to promote war, and we regard the promotion of war as a great crime. Our films, like other art departments, contribute the greatest strength to defending world peace and opposing the threat of war."

In defending peace, Soviet films first widely introduced the peaceful construction of the Soviet Union with newsreels and feature films, portraying the great communist construction projects and the construction of cities and villages, and portraying how the government strives to develop the people's economic construction and cultural construction. Comrade Fedorov said, "Our country is doing its best to carry out peaceful construction. As Comrade Stalin said, we are fully engaged in the peaceful construction of creating life, and we cannot invade others. This means that when a country is fully engaged in socialist construction, it will never invade other countries." Secondly, "In defending peace, we also express friendship with the people of all countries, especially the friendship between the peace and democracy camp. Soviet filmmakers and filmmakers from many people's democratic countries have cooperated to produce many films, such as 'Liberated China' and 'The Victory of the Chinese People', which were jointly produced with Chinese filmmakers. Many films have also been jointly produced with Romania, Czechoslovakia, Albania, and Poland. The films produced in cooperation with various democratic countries also demonstrate the peace and friendship between the people of various countries. We have also filmed some films that expose the crimes of the imperialist warmongers in launching war conspiracies. Such films include 'The Russian Question' and 'Secret Mission'."

Talking about how Soviet films reflect real life, Comrade Fedorov said, "Our Soviet reality is so rich, so our films must also catch up with this rich life. We have filmed many newsreels, colorful films reporting on Soviet life, and we have produced films introducing each Union Republic. These films very well portray the modern Soviet people. Such as 'Donbas Miners', 'Hero of the Golden Star', etc., are all films portraying the life of modern Soviet people. In addition, we have also adapted some films based on literary works, such as 'A Real Man', etc. These are all adapted from the works most loved by Soviet readers, and they are all films reflecting real life that are most loved by the Soviet people." Speaking here, Comrade Fedorov added, "But our Soviet filmmakers never stick to the narrow adaptation of literary works. Our films are a new supplement to literary works."

Comrade Fedorov is an expert who has been engaged in popular science film work for a long time. When we asked him to talk about the situation in this regard, he smiled and replied, "I know this question very well. Can I really talk to you until dawn?"

"Popular science films are also an important part of Soviet films. Every year we produce hundreds of science films. It is very obvious that we want to promote the achievements of Soviet science to the masses of the people. The achievements of Soviet science are multifaceted, and there are great achievements on the entire scientific front. This situation will also appear in China. A large country's science must develop in this way. Our dozens of scientific fields are developing simultaneously, and our people are very concerned about all scientific achievements. In addition to popular science films, we have also produced many science education films to promote advanced experience in science. Many of our science education films mainly help to exchange the production technology experience of the people. We pay special attention to agriculture, such as the promotion of cotton production increase methods.

We have recently produced some films that teach specialized professions. Such as driving a car, our country needs millions of car drivers, which is the most popular profession. With the help of famous scientists, we have produced films on automobile manufacturing to help car drivers master the technology of driving cars. Many people have learned to drive cars based on the films. In addition, there are films that teach how to drive trains and tractors. We produce hundreds of science education films every year."

Finally, Comrade Fedorov talked to us about the Soviet people's views on New China's films. He said: "The Soviet people watch Chinese films with great enthusiasm and interest. Chinese films have given us a very strong impression. As far as I know, in the past six months alone, 20 million viewers watched 'The White Haired Girl' and 'Steel Warrior'. Our newspapers, such as 'Pravda' and 'Izvestia', have praised Chinese films. We love them because they truly portray the people who are building a better life, and they portray the people who are fighting for peace. These films introduce us to the new heroism and selfless work spirit of the Chinese people. We hope to see more Chinese films on the screen in the future that portray modern life and portray how the people, under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, are carrying out great construction."

    访苏联电影艺术工作者代表团团长费道罗夫
    柏生
    来到北京不久的苏联电影艺术工作者代表团团长费道罗夫同志，在一个夜晚，刚从京郊石景山钢铁厂作报告回来，不顾一天的疲劳，就热情地接待着来访他的记者。
    他一开头就兴奋地讲他来到中国的印象。他说当他们的飞机一着中国陆地时，中国人民的热烈欢迎和对他们的真诚的热爱，就使他们深深地受到感动。他说：“将来我们回国时，一定把中国人民的热情和友谊带回去，一定把中国人民欢欣鼓舞地建设祖国的情形告诉给我们的人民。”费道罗夫同志特别提到他对毛主席的热爱，他说：“我感到是那样的幸福，我能够紧紧地和中国人民伟大的领袖毛主席握手。在‘中苏友好月’庆祝晚会那一天，我和毛主席坐在一起，同他讲话，这使我感到骄傲。”
    接着他就开始回答记者的问题。谈到苏联电影事业发展的情形，费道罗夫同志说：“电影在我国已有五十年的历史了，但是在十月革命以前，电影也就和工厂一样，都在资本家手里。那时资本家们利用电影来获得利润，来愚弄人民，维持他们的统治。当一九一七年十月革命，我国人民获得胜利后，在俄罗斯电影艺术上才开辟了一条新的道路。我们的党和政府和伟大的领袖列宁同志对电影事业非常重视，认为苏维埃电影艺术是最重要的大众化的艺术。在一九一九年我们国家由列宁亲自签署了一条‘关于全国摄影与电影工业移交人民教育委员会管理’的法令。从此苏维埃人民的国家电影事业诞生了。”
    在苏联电影发展的道路上，苏联共产党和苏维埃政府给予了最大的关怀。费道罗夫同志说：“在革命以前俄罗斯电影事业大部分是依靠外国，那时我们还不可能制造摄影机，我们要从英国、法国运来，这样我们就得付出很高的代价。在革命以后，我们党和政府提出了这个问题，并帮助电影工作者组织电影厂。而且建立了电影工业。”
    人们都知道在苏维埃政权建立初期，苏联人民进行了非常激烈的斗争，反对外来资本主义对年青的苏维埃的进攻，反对国内白匪军的叛乱。就在那个时候，苏联人民开始用电影抗议外来的干涉者，开始利用电影作武器和敌人进行斗争。费道罗夫同志说：“从那时起我们首先发展了新闻片，我们的摄影师们到战地前线纪录下了我们人民军队英勇反对白匪军的斗争。那时曾经拍摄了伟大的领袖列宁的伟大真实的镜头，这使我们经过二十八年以后，在今天还能活生生地看到我们领袖的英雄形象。那时我们摄影师们不只在前线，而且在后方摄制了我们的人民怎样英勇的修建工厂的情形。这样一来通过影片就动员了人民和敌人作战。从那时起，同时开始广泛摄制了宣传鼓动片。在纪录片之后，我们摄制了文化教育片子。在第一次世界大战后，我们国家经济遭受破坏，疾病流行得很厉害，我们就拍摄了许多防疫医疗的片子。”
    “一九二○年我们开始摄制了无声艺术片（故事片），那时我们摄制了不少片子，其中最优秀的片子像爱森斯坦的‘战舰波将军号’和由高尔基的小说改编的电影‘母亲’。前者是描写一九一五年俄国水兵的英勇斗争；后者是表现俄罗斯人民的伟大母亲的影片。
    “从一九三○年起，我们已经开始拥有很好电影装备了。我们开始制作了有声影片。有声影片的出现，使电影艺术更进一步推广到群众中去了。”从此在苏联银幕上响起了强有力的布尔什维克的语言。从一九三一年起，苏联已经完全停止了无声片。也就是从那时起苏联电影开始获得了巨大的成就。在那些年代里，拍摄了一些非常卓越的影片，像“夏伯阳”、“马克辛三部曲”、“列宁在十月”、“列宁在一九一八”、“党证”、“伟大的公民”等。在这些年代里，苏联电影事业很迅速地发展了，无论是新闻纪录片，还是科学教育片都开始发展起来，同时设立了规模宏大的制片厂以及电影机械工厂。
    一九四一年，当希特勒匪军进攻苏联的时候，苏联人民英勇的起来保卫祖国，所有的电影工作者也起来抗击敌人。费道罗夫同志告诉我们：那时有许多摄影师到前线上去拍摄前线战士英勇和敌人战斗的事迹，这些摄影师们有的就在战斗的岗位上牺牲了。在战争年月里，苏联也摄制了许多优秀的影片，像“丹娘”、“虹”、“伟大的转折”等，反映了伟大的战争现实，动员了广大人民向敌人进行神圣的斗争。
    卫国战争结束以后，开始转入和平建设时期。苏联电影工作者动员了所有的力量，更深刻地来表现苏联人民在伟大卫国战争中的英勇，和在和平年代苏联人民如何进行恢复和建设，制成如“斯大林格勒大会战”、“宣誓”、“攻克柏林”、“顿巴斯矿工”、“金星英雄”、“幸福的生活”等优秀的影片。
    “我们从战争的环境转到和平的环境并不是毫无阻碍的”，费道罗夫同志接着说：“因为那时候，我们有些电影工作者还不能很好地表现苏维埃人民的伟大崇高的品质。还不善于很好地表现胜利者的苏联人民，还不能很好地理解做一个胜利者的苏联人民，因此也制出了一些思想性较弱的影片。但联共中央及时发现和指出了电影工作者的这些错误。在
    一九四六年关于影片‘伟大生活’的决定中，指出了电影的正确的创作道路。战后我们很快地恢复了电影工业，并且很快地就超过了战前水平。现在不仅是在莫斯科、列宁格勒，而且在每一个加盟共和国首都，都有一个电影厂。在战后我们在新的技术基础上建设了我们的电影工业。这样就使我们有力量可能创造彩色影片了。现在大部分艺术片、新闻片、纪录片、时事片，都是拍五彩的了。”说到这里，费道罗夫同志愉快地告诉记者：“我们感到非常高兴，这次在中国放映的片子，都是五彩的。这些影片说明了在战后我们根据斯大林同志的指示，在新的工业上发展了我们的电影事业。”
    当我们谈起苏联电影如何为保卫世界和平和共产主义建设服务这个问题的时候，费道罗夫同志说：
    “在我们国家里，有一条法律，这是在任何资本主义国家都没有的，就是绝对禁止宣传战争，我们把宣传战争作为绝大的罪行。我们的电影也和其他艺术部门一样，把最大力量贡献在保卫世界和平，反对战争的威胁。”
    在保卫和平方面，苏联电影首先广泛地用新闻片与艺术片介绍了苏联的和平建设，表现伟大的共产主义建设工程以及城市与农村的建设，表现政府如何尽力发展人民的经济建设与文化建设。费道罗夫同志说：“我们国家尽力在进行和平的建设，正像斯大林同志所说，我们全力从事创造生活的和平建设，我们不可能侵略别人。这也就是说，当一个国家以全力进行社会主义建设的时候，他绝不会侵略别的国家。”其次，“在保卫和平方面，我们还表现与各国人民之间的友谊，特别是和平民主阵营之间的友谊。苏联电影工作者与许多人民民主国家电影工作者，共同合作，摄制了许多片子，如与中国的电影工作者合摄的‘解放了的中国’‘中国人民的胜利’。与罗马尼亚、捷克斯洛伐克、阿尔巴尼亚、波兰也合制了许多影片。与各民主国家合作的影片，也正说明了各国人民之间的和平与友谊。我们还拍摄了一些揭露帝国主义战争贩子发动战争阴谋罪行的片子。这一类影片，有‘俄罗斯问题’、
    ‘秘密使节’。”
    谈到苏联电影如何反映现实生活时，费道罗夫同志说：“我们苏维埃现实生活是如此丰富，因此我们的电影也就要赶上这丰富的生活。我们拍摄了许多新闻片，报道苏联生活的五彩影片，我们摄制了介绍每一个加盟共和国的影片，这些影片很好地表现了现代的苏维埃人民。如‘顿巴斯矿工’、‘金星英雄’等都是表现苏联现代人民生活的影片。此外我们还根据一些文学作品来改编了一些电影如
    ‘真正的人’等。这些都是根据苏联读者所最心爱的作品改编的，都是苏联人民所最喜爱的反映现实生活的影片。”说到这里，费道罗夫同志补充一句说：“但是我们的苏联电影工作者绝不拘泥于狭窄的文学著作的改编里，我们的电影却是文学作品的新的补充。”
    费道罗夫同志是从事科学普及影片工作很久的专家，当我们要求他谈谈这一方面的情形时，他笑着回答道：“关于这个问题，我知道得很清楚，我真可以和你们谈到天亮呢？”
    “关于科学普及影片，在苏联电影中也是一个重要的部分，每年我们摄制几百部科学影片。这是很明显的，我们是要使得苏联科学的成就推广到人民群众中去。苏联科学成就是多方面的，整个科学战线上都有很大成就。这种情形也将在中国出现。一个大国家的科学非这样发展不行。我们的数十门的科学同时在发展着，我们的人民非常关切所有科学上的成就。除了科学普及片以外，我们还摄制了许多科学教育影片，以推广科学方面的先进经验。我们许多科学教育片，主要是帮助交流人民的生产技术经验。我们特别注意农业方面，如棉花增产方法的推广等。
    我们最近制出了一些教授专门职业的影片。如开汽车，我们国家需要成百万的汽车司机，这是最大众化的职业。在著名的科学家帮助之下，我们就制出了汽车制造的影片，以帮助汽车司机掌握驾驶汽车的技术。许多人就是根据影片学会了开汽车。此外还有教开火车、开拖拉机的影片。我们每年要出产几百部科学教育片。”
    最后，费道罗夫同志和我们谈到苏联人民对新中国影片的观感。他说：“苏联人民是以极大热情和兴趣来看中国影片的，中国影片给了我们极强烈的印象。就我所知道的，仅去年半年之内，看‘白毛女’和‘钢铁战士’的观众就达两千万。我们的报纸如‘真理报’、‘消息报’等都赞扬中国的电影。我们热爱它们，因为它们真实地表现了建设着美好生活的人民，表现了为和平而斗争的人民。这些影片给我们介绍了中国人民的新的英雄主义和忘我的工作精神。我们希望今后能在银幕上看到更多的表现现代生活的中国影片，表现在共产党、毛主席领导下的人民如何进行伟大建设的影片。”（附图片）
