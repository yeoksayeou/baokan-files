    Fuxin Mining Bureau Basic Construction Company Promotes Advanced Soviet Experience
    Implements Assembly Line Method for Similar Housing Based on Instruction Charts
    Completing a Ninety-Six Day Project in Fifty-One Days
    The Civil Engineering Team of the Fuxin Mining Bureau Basic Construction Company has promoted the advanced Soviet experience of "assembly line operation for similar housing based on instruction charts" at construction sites 103 and 106. Now, both projects have been completed simultaneously, each shortening the construction period by forty-five days.
    These two projects are the same type of simple employee housing, each with thirty-eight buildings. Before construction began, technicians, managers, and veteran workers jointly studied the project details in detail, calculated the materials and labor, arranged the work sequences item by item, and then determined the labor organization based on average advanced quotas, which was then discussed by the workers and made into an engineering instruction chart. A building is divided into nineteen work sequences, so the workers are also divided into nineteen specialized groups and one mixed group. Each group starts from the first building in order and must complete the amount of work assigned to the group each day until the last building. For example, the Zhong Zhixian group is responsible for building the first course of bricks. On the first day, they build the first course of the first building, and on the second day, they build the first course of the second building. All thirty-eight buildings' first course of bricks are built by them. Therefore, by the twentieth day, a complete building will be completed, and thereafter one building will be completed every day until the entire project is completed. The material supply department also made a material supply instruction chart according to the engineering instruction chart, and strictly implements the regulations on the instruction chart for when to supply what materials, so there will be no work stoppage due to waiting for materials.
    Due to the implementation of operations according to the instruction chart, both construction sites have achieved great results:
    First, it improved site management. In the past, cadres and workers could not correctly estimate the progress and situation of the project in advance, but only "did whatever came up." Now, based on the chart operation, it is clear at a glance what level to reach on which day and what should be done; every worker knows to change a building every day. Therefore, management personnel no longer need to assign work temporarily every morning, nor do they need to solve messy problems such as work stoppages and manpower shortages all day long, so they also have time to promote advanced experience and study how to improve project quality.
    Second, it is easy to promote advanced experience. Because management cadres have time and the work of each process is connected but not evenly developed, it inevitably creates conditions for the promotion of advanced experience. After the Zhong Zhixian group implemented the template bricklaying method, the An Cunrong and Xu Jisheng groups also created advanced experiences of rapid purlin installation and curved ruler tiling in order to catch up with the progress. Now, advanced experiences have appeared in almost all nineteen work sequences.
    Third, operation specialization improves work efficiency and project quality. Because each group does one job to the thirty-eighth building, the technology becomes more and more proficient, and the efficiency naturally increases. For example, the 106 construction site initially had thirteen people building the second course of bricks, and later reduced to nine people to complete the same task. At the same time, due to the specialization of work sequences, a dedicated responsibility system is naturally formed.
    Due to the above three main reasons, the entire project was very organized and rhythmic during the process. Both projects were scheduled to take ninety-six working days, but in reality, they only took fifty-one days, almost halving the construction period. (Reprinted from Northeast Daily)

    阜新矿务局基本建设公司推广苏联先进经验
    实行同类型房屋按指示图表流水作业法
    九十六天的工程在五十一天内就完成了
    阜新矿务局基本建设公司土木建筑工程队在一○三、一○六两工地推广了苏联的“同类型房屋按指示图表流水作业”先进经验，现在，两工程已同时竣工，各缩短工期四十五天。
    这两个工程是同一类型的简易职工住宅，各三十八栋。在开工之前，由技术人员、管理人员、老工人共同详细研究了工程内容，计算了工料，分项排列工序，然后按平均先进定额确定劳动组织，交由工人讨论之后，制成工程指示图表。一栋房屋共分十九个工序，因此也把工人分为十九个专业小组和一个混合组。每个小组都依次从第一栋做起，每日必须完成本组所分担的工作量，直至最末一栋。如仲志先小组负责砌第一部架砖，第一天砌第一栋房屋的第一部架，第二天就砌第二栋的第一部架，所有三十八栋房屋的第一部架都由他们砌。所以到第二十日，即有一栋完整房屋落成，之后每日完成一栋，直至全部工程完了。材料供应部门也按工程指示图表做出材料供应指示图表，什么时候供应什么料，都严格执行指示图表上的规定，因而不会停工待料。
    由于实行了按指示图表作业，这两个工地都收到了很大效果：
    第一，改进了工地管理。过去，干部、工人对工程进度和情况，不能预先正确估计，只是“做到哪儿算哪儿”。现在，依据图表作业，哪一天做到什么程度，应该做什么，都一目了然；每个工人都知道一天换一栋。所以，管理人员再不用每天早上临时派工，也不用成天解决窝工、少人等杂乱问题了，因而也有时间推广先进经验和研究提高工程质量。
    第二，便于推广先进经验。由于管理干部有时间以及每个工序工作衔接而又不会平衡发展的关系，必然地给推广先进经验创造了条件。仲志先小组实行了模板砌砖法之后，安存荣、许继盛两组为了赶上进度，也随着创造了快速装檩和弯尺挂瓦的先进经验。现在，在十九个工序中几乎都有先进经验出现。
    第三，操作专业化，提高了工作效率和工程质量。因为每个小组都是各就一项工作做到第三十八栋，所以技术日益熟练，效率自然提高。比如一○六工地砌二部架砖最初是十三个人，以后减少到九个人同样完成任务。同时，由于工序专业化，自然形成了专责制。
    由于以上三个主要原因，因而全部工程在进行中，非常有条理，有节奏。两个工程预定都需要九十六个工作日，实际都只用了五十一天，几乎缩短了一半的工期。    （转载东北日报）
