    East China Coal Miners' Union and Jiaozuo Mining Bureau Hold Meeting
    to Promote Advanced Experiences in Basic Construction
    The China Coal Miners' Union East China Preparatory Committee convened the East China State-owned Coal Mine Civil Engineering Advanced Experience Promotion Conference. At the meeting, performances were given of Su Changyou's double-handed mortar squeezing method, Xie Wanfu's carpentry assembly line method, and Yu Donghai's caulking assembly line method. An exhibition was also held of more than forty new tools, both physical objects and models, created and improved by civil engineering workers from the Huainan Mining Bureau and the Shandong Mining Bureau. After the introduction of typical cases and practical demonstrations, the conference further affirmed the superiority of advanced working methods, broke down conservative thinking, and clearly stated that: to complete basic construction tasks, it is necessary to learn and promote advanced working methods. According to statistics, eighteen bricklaying teams in the Huainan Mining Bureau and the Shandong Mining Bureau have used Su Changyou's double-handed mortar squeezing method, and eleven carpentry teams have used Xie Wanfu's carpentry assembly line method. Now the work efficiency of these teams has increased by one to two times compared to the past. In the Huainan Mining Bureau alone, due to the promotion of advanced working methods, the state saved ten billion yuan in the second half of this year.
    The Jiaozuo Mining Bureau held a basic construction advanced producers' meeting on November 8th, clearly proposing that the central link to completing basic construction tasks is to mobilize and rely on the masses and conscientiously promote advanced experiences that play a decisive role.
    The meeting pointed out that the promotion of advanced experience in basic construction in the past has achieved great results. The promotion of mud slurry method and safe and fast drilling experience in the drilling engineering avoided accidents and improved work efficiency. In October, eight out of twelve drilling rigs used the mud slurry method, reaching a progress of 1,977 meters, an increase of 20 percent over September. The promotion of parallel operation and assembly line operation methods in well and tunnel engineering greatly improved work efficiency. The May 1st Engineering Team created a record of 16.4 meters per day in the No. 5 well project after implementing parallel operation and assembly line operation methods.
    The meeting decided to continue to promote advanced experience, designate special personnel to be responsible, and strive to complete this year's basic construction tasks on schedule.

    华东煤矿工会和焦作矿务局召开会议
    推广基本建设中的先进经验
    中国煤矿工会华东区筹备委员会召开华东区国营煤矿土木建筑先进经验推广大会。会上表演了苏长有双手挤浆法、谢万福木工流水作业法、于东海抅缝流水作业法，展览了淮南矿务局和山东矿务局的土木建筑工人创造和改进的四十多种新工具的实物和模型。经过典型介绍和实际表演之后，大会进一步肯定了先进工作方法的优越性，打破了保守思想，并明确地认为：要完成基本建设任务，必须学习和推广先进工作方法。据统计，淮南矿务局和山东矿务局已有十八个瓦工小组使用了苏长有双手挤浆法，十一个木工小组使用了谢万福木工流水作业法。现在这些小组的工作效率都比过去提高了一倍到两倍。仅在淮南矿务局中，由于推广先进工作方法，在今年下半年内就给国家节省了十亿元。
    焦作矿务局在十一月八日召开基本建设先进生产者会议，明确地提出完成基本建设任务的中心环节是发动和依靠群众，认真地推广有决定作用的先进经验。
    会议指出：过去在基本建设中推广先进经验，收到了很大效果。在钻探工程中推广了泥浆法和安全快速钻进的经验，避免了事故，提高了工作效率。十月份在十二部钻机中有八部钻机使用了泥浆法，就达到了一九七七公尺的进度，比九月份的进度提高了百分之二十。在井巷井筒工程中推广了平行作业法和流水作业法，大大提高了工作效率。五一工程队在五号井工程中实行平行作业法和流水作业法以后，创造了日进一六点四公尺的最高纪录。
    会议决定：继续推广先进经验，并确定专人负责，为按期完成今年基本建设任务而斗争。
