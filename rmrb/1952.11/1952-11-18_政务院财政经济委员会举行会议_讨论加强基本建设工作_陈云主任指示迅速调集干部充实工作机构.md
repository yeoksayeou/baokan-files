    The State Council's Financial and Economic Committee Holds a Meeting to Discuss Strengthening Capital Construction Work
    Director Chen Yun Instructs to Quickly Transfer Cadres to Strengthen Working Institutions
    [This newspaper reports] The Central People's Government State Council's Financial and Economic Committee held a meeting on October 22nd and 23rd to discuss capital construction issues for 1953. Director Chen Yun gave important instructions at the meeting regarding the direction of capital construction, work organization, and personnel supplementation for 1953. Comrade Chen Yun pointed out: 1953 will be a year of large-scale economic construction, with tasks more complex and arduous than any previous year. The success of next year's work will have a significant impact on future capital construction efforts. After describing the development of production and capital construction over the past three years, Comrade Chen Yun pointed out: In the coming years, capital construction work will occupy a paramount position in economic work. However, this work is still unfamiliar to the vast majority of our cadres. Therefore, several ministries and bureaus with heavy capital construction tasks must focus their leadership on capital construction work, learning and doing a good job in it. Comrade Chen Yun then discussed the capital construction tasks for next year and the current state of capital construction strength and institutions. He said: Based on these circumstances, the main contradiction in our current capital construction is that the capital construction tasks are very heavy, while the capital construction forces are very weak. Therefore, we must quickly increase the strength in this area and quickly establish and strengthen capital construction institutions—design institutions and construction institutions. These institutions must have strong leadership cores, as well as advanced technical personnel and skilled workers. Regarding the source of personnel, Comrade Chen Yun emphasized: Currently, the staff in capital construction are mainly transferred from the production sector. He explained in detail the necessity and possibility of transferring personnel from the production sector. He said: According to advanced standards, we still lack many cadres and technical personnel in the production sector, but many capital construction units do not even have one person, and many departments have not yet established design institutions. Therefore, compared to production and capital construction, the production departments have far more cadres and technical personnel than the capital construction departments. Some people believe that production will collapse after personnel are transferred from the production sector. This view is incorrect. It can be asserted that production will not collapse after personnel are transferred from the production sector. Because, first, in the past three years, a large number of cadres and technical personnel have emerged in the production sector; second, even if some personnel are transferred from the production sector, and problems arise that require their expertise, the personnel transferred to do capital construction work can be temporarily assembled to study together and overcome the difficulties in production. He said: The impact on production after personnel are transferred is not significant, and the production departments will cultivate new cadres; but if a large number of cadres and technical personnel are not transferred from the production sector to capital construction, then capital construction will inevitably collapse. Subsequently, Comrade Chen Yun gave instructions on the work that must be carried out in capital construction this winter. After Comrade Chen Yun finished speaking, the ministers of various industrial and transportation ministries successively reported on the capital construction situation and experiences in capital construction of their respective ministries. Finally, Comrade Chen Yun made a summary, emphasizing that in capital construction issues, industrial and transportation departments must eliminate the mentality of waiting and dependence. Waiting for the personnel departments to allocate cadres, instead of actively transferring them from the production sector; relying on the Ministry of Construction Engineering for design and construction, instead of actively organizing their own design and construction forces, are all wrong, and the result will inevitably delay construction. Therefore, we must be determined to quickly transfer personnel, establish and strengthen the specialized design and construction organizations of various ministries. Only by establishing the principle of self-reliance can we be responsible for the country's large-scale construction.

    政务院财政经济委员会举行会议
    讨论加强基本建设工作
    陈云主任指示迅速调集干部充实工作机构
    【本报讯】中央人民政府政务院财政经济委员会于十月二十二日和二十三日举行会议，讨论一九五三年的基本建设问题。陈云主任在会上就一九五三年基本建设的方针、工作组织和人员补充问题作了重要指示。陈云同志指出：一九五三年将是大规模经济建设的一年，其任务较以往任何一年都要复杂、繁重。明年工作的好坏，对以后的基本建设工作有极大的影响。陈云同志叙述了三年来生产和基本建设的发展情况后指出：今后几年，基本建设工作将在经济工作中占头等重要的地位。但这一工作对我们绝大多数干部来说还是生疏的，因之几个基本建设任务繁重的部、局，必须把领导重点放在基本建设工作上，学习并做好基本建设工作。陈云同志接着论述了明年基本建设的任务和目前已有的基本建设力量及其机构的情况。他说：根据这些情况来看，目前我们基本建设中的主要矛盾是基本建设任务十分重大，而基本建设力量则十分薄弱。因此必须迅速使这方面的力量增长起来，迅速建立和充实基本建设机构——设计机构和施工机构。这些机构必须要有坚强的领导骨干，以及先进的技术人员和技术工人。关于人员来源问题，陈云同志着重指出：目前基本建设中的工作人员主要是从生产方面抽调。他并详尽地说明了从生产方面抽调人员的必要性和可能性。他说：按照先进标准，目前我们在生产方面的干部和技术人员确实还缺得很多，但是很多基本建设单位却连一个人也没有，很多部门设计机构还没有建立起来。因此，生产和基本建设二者比较起来，生产部门的干部和技术人员还是比基本建设部门多得多。有人认为从生产方面抽调人员以后，生产就会垮台，这种看法是不对的。可以肯定地说，从生产方面抽调了人员以后，生产是不会垮台的。因为，第一，三年来我们在生产方面涌现了大批干部和技术人员；第二，即令生产方面抽走了一些人员以后，发生了需要他们来解决的问题，也还可以把抽调出来做基本建设工作的人员，临时集合起来，共同研究，克服生产中的困难问题。他说：抽调人员以后对生产影响是不大的，而且生产部门又会培养出新的干部来；但是如果不从生产部门大量地抽调干部和技术人员到基本建设方面去，那末基本建设就必垮无疑。随后陈云同志对基本建设今冬必须进行的工作作了指示。陈云同志讲话结束后，工业与交通各部部长相继汇报了各部基本建设的情况和进行基本建设的经验。最后，由陈云同志做总结，他特别强调在基本建设问题上，工业与交通部门必须消除等待和依赖思想。等待人事部门分配干部，而不积极地从生产方面抽调；依赖建筑工程部给设计、施工，而不积极地组织自己的设计和施工力量，都是错误的，其结果必将贻误建设。因此必须下定决心迅速地调集人员，建立各部专业的设计和施工组织并充实它。只有确立自力更生的方针，才是对国家大规模建设负责的态度。
