Having learned from the lesson of failing to complete the basic construction plan in 1951, the Fuxin Mining Bureau began preparing for the 1952 project in the third quarter of 1951. The execution of this year's plan proves that this approach is entirely correct. The total workload of the Fuxin Mining Bureau this year is four times larger than in 1951, and the installation workload is three times larger, but it can basically complete the national plan and the production increase and conservation plan. The main reason is that the preparation work was done early and relatively fully.

The experience of the Fuxin Mining Bureau in preparing for basic construction in 1952 is:

Overcoming the Waiting Mentality and Proactively Compiling the Annual Basic Construction Plan

In the past, the Fuxin Mining Bureau's plans were always compiled hastily in a rush manner. Before formulating the plan, there was not enough time for thorough investigation and exploration, and there was a lack of reliable figures or technical basis. Therefore, the plan often changed during the execution process, so that engineering management, design, supply, statistics, and other departments, as well as construction units, were all clueless, and the entire basic construction work could not be carried out rhythmically and proactively. Last year, leading cadres at all levels of the bureau learned from this lesson, overcame the waiting mentality, and started preparing for the compilation of the annual plan in advance. Based on the initially proposed outline plan, they carefully studied the purpose and effect of each project and repeatedly studied and reviewed each project item. Then, based on the results of the review, all projects were divided into four types: most important, important, secondary, and least important, and geological surveys, exploration, design, and unit project cost estimations were immediately started for the most important projects.

At the same time, based on the advanced experience created in the construction of 1951 and the level reached by general workers, workers and technicians were mobilized to fully discuss and revise the advanced average quotas used to compile the plan. Therefore, the plan could be completed within the prescribed time. Judging from the execution this year, this plan is relatively accurate and reasonable in terms of the number of projects, project progress, and investment use. For example, the planned stripping volume of the Haizhou Open-Pit Mine in 1952 was three times larger than the actual stripping volume in 1951. At that time, some people suspected that this number was too large, but the actual execution this year proved that this plan was correct. This is because the planned stripping volume was specifically studied and calculated. Because the plan is correct, every staff member has also established a correct concept of the plan. Generally speaking, the bureau's employees are relatively familiar with and value the planned figures, and the national plan has indeed become the legal figure in the bureau's basic construction.

Centralized Leadership of Design Work and Rational Use of Design Forces

Since the beginning of September 1951, the Fuxin Mining Bureau has carried out surveying, exploration, design, and other work in an orderly manner according to the importance and urgency of the project. At the end of 1951 and the beginning of 1952, more than 100 technical personnel and more than 280 financial personnel were transferred from the production and basic construction departments to work in the design department. They were organized to study relevant basic construction documents and establish a concept of actively learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union. Then, the technical personnel and financial personnel were organized into New Qiu Open-Pit Mine, Haizhou Open-Pit Mine, electromechanical, water and sand filling, and other groups, and tasks were assigned according to each person's professional level and the nature of the project. The expertise of technical personnel and financial personnel was fully utilized, and the division of labor was clarified, so that the work procedures were closely linked, and staggered operations were carried out in design and budget. This accelerated the design progress and solved the difficulty of lacking technical personnel.

The personnel participating in the design were centrally led by the bureau's Design Committee, and the basic design of each project was completed before the end of December, creating conditions for the compilation of the annual plan. Then, according to the requirements of the Ministry of Industry, technical designs were successively put forward from March to June, so that each project started on time. The quality of the engineering technical design, except for the changes in the New Qiu water and sand filling design, is basically in line with the requirements.

Massively Cultivating Reserve Forces in a Planned and Purposeful Manner

In 1951, the Fuxin Mining Bureau used the methods of off-the-job training and on-the-job training (apprenticeship) to train more than 600 technical workers in shaft, open-pit, drilling, and civil construction and more than 60 technical personnel and management personnel for 1952. It also trained and transported 214 technical workers to other mining bureaus and the Central South District, and transported a group of cadres to the Coal Mine Administration. At the beginning of 1951, they selected 185 young workers and technicians with better political quality from these personnel and sent them to Xi'an, Beipiao, and other places to learn the experience of building shaft projects. These technical workers and technicians have now become the backbone of building the Ping'an shaft and the main force in ensuring the early start of the Ping'an shaft this year and completing the national plan and the production increase and conservation plan. In the winter of 1951, they also opened a training class including 360 carpenters, tilers, and ordinary workers to conduct training in advanced working methods. After the training, these workers formed 12 new-style bricklaying groups and 6 woodworking assembly line groups, becoming activists in promoting advanced experience. In the case of a shortage of tilers, they completed the construction task of 45,000 square meters of staff dormitory in 1952. Similarly, the Haizhou Open-Pit Mine's ability to better complete the national plan is also inseparable from the fact that the mine had a large number of technical workers in 1952.

Mastering and Solving Equipment and Material Problems Through Inventory of Warehouses and Balance Meetings and Construction Expansion Meetings

In October 1951, the Fuxin Mining Bureau began to investigate the potential capacity, equipment efficiency, maximum production volume, and the amount of idle equipment of its subordinate factories and mines. When the formulation of the basic construction plan proposed the required equipment, it first resolved it from the production side and the warehouse through the bureau's balance meeting and equipment card (the equipment required in the plan was asked to the equipment department whether there was inventory or transfer from the production side). This not only saved national investment but also solved some equipment that was not easy to order. The Ping'an shaft was able to start early because it timely transferred several winches from the production side, overcoming the difficulty of not being able to order equipment.

The equipment transferred from production factories and mines is not all suitable for basic construction projects and is also scattered in various places. In order to avoid temporary difficulties, the equipment personnel concentrated these equipment before the start of construction, identified and repaired them one by one, and were responsible for supplying the site within a certain period.

The Fuxin Mining Bureau has checked materials three or four times and has effectively mastered the amount of stagnant materials. At the same time, according to the plan requirements, it has reserved a certain amount of main materials and organized the production of red bricks at the beginning of the year according to the needs of buildings. Thus, the supply of certain materials was guaranteed.

When each key project starts, the mining bureau will hold an expanded construction meeting to check the preparation of all aspects, especially the preparation of equipment, main materials, and labor. Any difficulties of the construction personnel are also raised at this meeting as much as possible, and decisions are made at the meeting to designate special personnel to be responsible for solving them. This kind of meeting has played a certain guarantee role in the completion of the plan for each key project.

In short, the reason why the Fuxin Mining Bureau was able to do a good job in the preparation of basic construction in 1952 is mainly because the leading cadres are good at accepting past experiences and lessons, and have initially touched the laws of basic construction work. Therefore, they can have foresight for basic construction work and draw out strength to do the preparation work for the next year in the season of tight construction that year. And they are good at mobilizing the masses, so that every employee engaged in basic construction understands the importance of preparation work, and then everyone can lay the foundation for the work of the next year in their own posts with a clear understanding.

At present, the Fuxin Mining Bureau is summarizing the experiences and lessons of this year and is preparing for the basic construction of next year. In addition to starting to check fixed assets, studying and improving organizational structures, and carrying out a series of preparations in the training and allocation of planning, design, and construction forces, it is also preparing to use the spare time of carpenters in winter to prefabricate a large number of doors, windows, and house frames to make more adequate preparations for the civil construction project in 1953.

    阜新矿务局一九五二年基本建设准备工作是怎样进行的
    阜新矿务局接受一九五一年没有完成基本建设计划的教训，一九五一年第三季度就开始做一九五二年的工程准备工作。今年计划执行的情况，证明这种做法是完全正确的。阜新矿务局今年的总工作量比一九五一年大四倍，安装工作量大三倍，但基本上能够完成国家计划和增产节约计划，主要原因就是准备工作做得早和做得比较充分。
    阜新矿务局一九五二年基本建设准备工作的经验是：
    克服等待思想，主动编好基本建设年度计划
    阜新矿务局过去历次计划都是匆促地用突击方式编制的，制定计划之先没有充分时间进行周密的调查与勘察工作，缺乏可靠的数字或技术根据，因此在执行过程中计划经常变动，以致工程管理、设计、供应、统计等部门以及施工单位都心中无数，整个基本建设工作不能有节奏地、主动地进行。去年，该局各级领导干部接受了这个教训，克服了等待思想，提前开始了编制年度计划的准备工作。他们根据初步提出的轮廓计划，认真研究了每项工程的目的与效果，反复地研究、审查了各工程项目；再根据审核的结果，将所有工程分为最主要、主要、次要、最次要四种，并立即开始进行最主要工程的地质调查、勘察、设计、单位工程的估工估料等工作。
    与此同时，又根据一九五一年施工中创造的先进经验和一般工人达到的水平，发动工人、技术人员充分讨论，据以修正了编制计划用的先进平均定额；因此得以在规定的时间内编完了计划。从今年执行情况来看，这次计划不论从工程数量、工程进度以及投资使用上，都是比较准确与合理的。例如海州露天矿一九五二年的计划剥土量比一九五一年实际剥土量大了三倍，当时有人怀疑这个数字是不是太大了，但今年实际执行情况却证明了这个计划是正确的，这就是由于在拟定计划剥土量时经过了具体研究与计算。因为计划正确，也使每个工作人员树立了正确的计划观念。一般地说，该局职工对计划数字都比较熟悉和重视，国家计划确实已成为该局基本建设中的法律数字。
    集中领导设计工作，合理使用设计力量
    阜新矿务局自一九五一年九月初开始，按照工程的轻重缓急，有次序地进行测量、勘察、设计等工作；并在一九五一年底及一九五二年初，先后从生产和基本建设部门调集一百多名技术人员和二百八十多名财经工作人员到设计部门工作，组织他们学习有关基本建设的文件，树立了积极学习苏联先进经验的观念；然后将技术人员与财经人员组成新邱露天矿、海州露天、机电、水沙充填等小组，根据每人的业务水平及工程性质分配了任务，充分利用技术人员与财经工作人员的专长，明确分工，使工作程序紧密衔接，进行设计与预算上的交错作业；这样便加速了设计进度，同时解决了缺少技术人员的困难。
    参加设计的人员，由该局的设计委员会集中领导，在十二月底以前完成了各工程的基本设计，为编制年度计划创造了条件；接着又根据工业部要求，在三月到六月间陆续提出了技术设计，使各工程按时开工。工程技术设计的质量，除新邱水沙充填设计有变更外，其它都基本合乎要求。
    有计划有目的地大量培养后备力量
    阜新矿务局在一九五一年中，先后用脱离生产训练与在职训练（带徒弟）的办法，为一九五二年培养了六百多名竖井、露天矿、钻探、土木建筑等技术工人和六十多名技术人员与管理人员，并为其它矿务局及中南区培养、输送了二百十四名技术工人，为煤矿管理局输送了一部分干部。一九五一年初，他们在这些人员中选出一百八十五名政治质量较好的青年工人和技术人员，派往西安、北票等地学习建筑竖井工程的经验。这些技术工人和技术人员目前都已成为建筑平安竖井的骨干分子，成为平安竖井能在今年提早开工，保证完成国家计划与增产节约计划的主要力量。一九五一年冬季，他们还开办了包括三百六十名木瓦工和普通工的训练班，进行先进工作方法的训练。训练结束后，这些工人组成了十二个新式砌砖小组、六个木工流水作业小组，成为推广先进经验的积极分子，在瓦工缺乏的情况下，完成了一九五二年四万五千平方公尺职工宿舍的建设任务。同样，海州露天矿能较好地完成国家计划，也是与该矿在一九五二年中拥有大批技术工人分不开的。
    通过清查仓库和平衡会议、施工扩大
    会议，掌握与解决了设备、材料问题
    阜新矿务局在一九五一年十月间即开始调查所属各厂矿的潜在能力、设备效率、最高生产量及闲置设备数量，当制订基本建设计划提出需要的设备时，先通过局的平衡会议及设备卡片（计划中需要之设备，用卡片向设备部门询问是否有库存或从生产方面调拨），从生产方面和仓库中解决，这样，不但节约了国家投资，还解决了一些不易订货的设备。平安竖井就是因为及时从生产方面调拨来几台卷扬机，克服了设备订货不到的困难，得以提早开工。
    从生产厂矿调拨来的设备，不是都适用基本建设工程，同时还分散在各地。为了避免临时发生困难，设备人员在开工之前就把这些设备集中起来，一一加以鉴定、修理，在一定时间内负责供给现场。
    阜新矿务局先后清查了三四次材料，切实掌握了呆滞材料的数量。同时根据计划要求，储备了一定数量的主要材料，并在年初根据建筑物的需要组织了红砖的生产。从而保证了某些材料的供应。
    每项重点工程开工时，矿务局都要召开一次扩大施工会议，检查各方面的准备情况，特别是设备、主要材料与劳动力的准备情况；施工人员有什么困难也尽量在这个会上提出，在会上做出决定，指定专人负责解决。这种会议对各项重点工程计划的完成都起了一定的保证作用。
    总之，阜新矿务局所以能做好一九五二年的基本建设准备工作，主要是由于领导干部善于接受过去的经验教训，初步摸到了基本建设工作的规律，所以对基本建设工作能有远见，在当年施工紧张的季节，抽调出力量来做下年度的准备工作；而且善于发动群众，使每个从事基本建设的职工都了解准备工作的重要性，进而使每个人都心中有数地在自己的岗位上为下年度的工作打下基础。
    目前阜新矿务局正在总结今年的经验教训和进行明年基本建设的准备工作。除已开始清查固定资产、研究改进组织机构，在计划、设计、施工力量的培养和配备上进行一系列的准备工作外，并准备在冬季利用木工空闲时间，预制大批门窗房架，为一九五三年的土木建筑工程作更充分的准备。
