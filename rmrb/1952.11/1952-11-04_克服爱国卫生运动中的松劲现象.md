A brief review of cultural life:

Overcoming Slackening in the Patriotic Health Campaign

The nationwide Patriotic Health Campaign has not only greatly improved the environmental sanitation of cities but also changed the sanitary conditions of vast rural areas. The significant reduction in the incidence of diseases in various regions this year (with infectious diseases almost eradicated in some places) fully illustrates this point.

Currently, the campaign is developing towards depth, popularization, and regularity. However, due to seasonal changes, leading comrades of relevant departments and some members of the masses in many regions mistakenly believe that the campaign has reached a stage of "enough is enough"; some cadres think that "the campaign is over" and no longer carry out supervision and inspection. For example, the health committees in some areas and individual units in Shaanxi and Shanxi provinces have become organizations in name only. In Xi'an City, Shaanxi Province, some streets and alleys where sanitation work was done relatively well are now even drying horse manure in some places, and cleaning is not as diligent as before. The "reason" is: "It's getting cold, sanitation work is not important anymore." Some areas in Henan Province only pay attention to the leadership training of typical key areas, ignoring the sanitation work in most places, so there are many "dead corners" and "blank spots." Some advanced demonstration areas in certain provinces and cities have also slowly fallen behind. For example, Weinan in Shaanxi Province, which used to be very active, is now neglected by most streets and units. More seriously, some counties in the Linfen Special District of Shanxi Province have transferred all the cadres of the health section because they only cared about the "central task," which affected the development of the campaign.

The reasons for the above phenomena are, first of all, that some leading cadres have not realized that patriotic health work is a long-term task of changing customs and habits, and it is not just a temporary or seasonal measure. Secondly, they do not understand that new garbage is produced every day after the old garbage is cleared; the flies and mosquitoes of summer and autumn are gone, but a large number of fly pupae and female mosquitoes are hidden in toilets and dark places.

In order to consolidate our achievements in sanitation work, relevant departments in various regions must continue to strengthen their leadership in patriotic health work. In areas where the masses have been fully mobilized, leadership should be further strengthened to deepen this work; the masses should be educated to realize that protecting their health and doing a good job in sanitation is a concrete patriotic action. In areas that have achieved initial results, efforts should be made to consolidate them and further improve the grassroots health organizations and various health work systems on the existing basis, and formulate practical work plans. In areas where the masses have not been fully mobilized, all available forces should be mobilized, and publicity and education should be strengthened among the masses to "make up for missed lessons" in order to catch up with key areas and advanced areas.

### 克服爱国卫生运动中的松劲现象

    克服爱国卫生运动中的松劲现象
    全国爱国卫生运动的开展，不仅大大地改进了城市的环境卫生，也改变了广大农村的卫生面貌。今年各地发病率的大大减少（有些地方传染病几乎已绝迹），就充分说明了这一点。
    目前运动已向深入、普及、经常化的方向发展。但是由于季节的变换，不少地区的有关部门的领导同志和部分群众，错误地认为运动已到“适可而止”的阶段；有些干部认为“运动已经完了”，不再进行督促和检查。例如陕西和山西省的部分地区和个别单位的卫生委员会已变成有名无实的组织。陕西西安市某些卫生工作做得比较好的街巷，现在有的地方竟晒起马粪来了，打扫得也不如以前那么勤了。“理由”是：“天凉了，卫生工作不要紧了。”河南省某些地区只注意典型重点区的领导培养，忽视多数地方的卫生工作，因此有不少“死角”和“空白点”。某些省市的先进示范区也慢慢的落后了。如陕西渭南，过去搞得很热闹，现在则大部分街道和单位已经冷淡了下去。更严重的是，山西临汾专区的某些县份因为只顾搞“中心工作”，竟将卫生科的干部全部调走，以致影响了运动的开展。
    产生上述现象的原因，首先是某些领导干部没有认识到，爱国卫生工作是一个移风易俗的长期性的工作，它并不只是一种临时性的、或季节性的措施。其次，他们不懂得：旧的垃圾清除了，新的垃圾又每天都在产生；夏秋的苍蝇、蚊子不见了，厕所里、阴暗的地方却藏着大量的蝇蛹和雌蚊。
    为了巩固我们的卫生工作成绩，各地有关部门必须继续加强对爱国卫生工作的领导。在群众已经充分发动的地区，应继续加强领导，使这一工作深入下去；教育群众，使他们认识保护身体健康、做好卫生工作，便是一种具体的爱国行动。已有初步成绩的地区，则应积极予以巩固，并在现有的基础上进一步健全卫生基层组织和各种卫生工作制度，订立切实可行的工作计划。在群众尚未充分发动的地区，应动员一切可以运用的力量，并对群众加强宣传教育，进行“补课”，以便赶上重点区和先进区。
