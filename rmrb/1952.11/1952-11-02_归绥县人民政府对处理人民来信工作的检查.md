    Guisui County People's Government's Inspection of Handling People's Letters

    Editor: After reading the "Reader's Letters" column in the People's Daily on September 10th, which criticized "Guisui County People's Government's Lack of Attention to Handling People's Letters," we immediately instructed Wang Guanghua of the County People's Inquiry Office to conduct a self-criticism and dispatched personnel to assist him in conducting a thorough inspection. From the establishment of our County People's Inquiry Office in October 1951 to October 7th of this year, we directly received 56 letters from the people, and 57 letters forwarded by the People's Inquiry Offices of Suiyuan Province and Guisui City, and other organs, totaling 113 letters. Of these letters, we only handled three ourselves; nine were not processed at all; and for the remaining 101, we simply forwarded them to other units and did not inquire about the results. After the inspection, we realized that this was primarily due to our lack of attention to the work of handling people's letters, treating this work as an "extra burden" and dealing with it with a bureaucratic attitude. Comrade Wang Guanghua, who was in charge of the People's Inquiry Office, also showed an irresponsible attitude, treating people's letters with a clerical approach, turning the People's Inquiry Office into a "transfer station" for people's letters. There was no reporting system, no inspection system, and even less talk of summarization or learning. The county magistrate and the Civil Affairs Section both managed this work, yet neither truly managed it. Now, in addition to clearing up the past people's letters, we have decided to start by strengthening leadership and establishing systems, implement the spirit of the "Three-Anti" movement, learn from the "Zhang Shunyou Incident," and do a good job in receiving the people and handling people's letters.

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    归绥县人民政府对处理人民来信工作的检查
    编辑同志：我们看了九月十日人民日报“读者来信”栏刊登的“归绥县人民政府不重视处理人民来信”的批评后，当即让我县人民问事处王光华作了检讨，并派人协助他进行彻底检查。我县人民问事处从一九五一年十月成立起，到今年十月七日止，直接收到人民来信五十六件，绥远省、归绥市人民问事处和其他机关转来的人民来信五十七件，共计一百一十三件。这些信，我们自己仅处理了三件；有九件根本未作处理；其余的一百零一件，我们只是顺水推舟似地转给其他单位去，便不问结果了。检查以后，我们认识到：这首先是由于我们对处理人民来信工作重视不够，把这一工作当成一种“额外负担”，用官僚主义的态度去应付；负责人民问事处的王光华同志，也表现了不负责任的态度，用文牍主义的办法去对待人民来信，使人民问事处成了人民来信的“转运站”。既无汇报制度，也无检查制度，更说不上总结、学习等等，县长和民政科对于这一工作，是谁都管，又谁也不管。现在，我们除了清理过去的人民来信之外，决定从加强领导、建立制度开始，贯彻“三反”运动的精神，接受“张顺有事件”的教训，做好接见人民和处理人民来信的工作。    绥远省归绥县人民政府
