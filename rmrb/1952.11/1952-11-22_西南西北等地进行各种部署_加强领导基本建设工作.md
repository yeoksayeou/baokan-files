Xinhua News Agency dispatch: To welcome the upcoming large-scale national economic construction tasks, the Southwest, Northwest, and other regions are making various deployments to vigorously strengthen leadership in basic construction work.

    The Southwest Region has made important deployments for the upcoming large-scale basic construction work. In terms of organizational structure, the Southwest District Financial and Economic Committee will establish a Basic Construction Department to uniformly lead the basic construction work of the entire region. The basic construction units of each enterprise management bureau and each factory and mine must be separated from the corresponding production units and complete this work by the end of November. According to the nature, size, urgency, and importance of the basic construction tasks, in addition to generally establishing basic construction departments and design departments, the non-ferrous metals, ordnance, iron and steel, and power bureaus will also establish engineering companies, and the non-ferrous metals, ordnance, iron and steel, and coal mines will also establish geological organizations. All basic construction units, whether newly built or improved, must become independent accounting, financial management, and economic accounting units. In terms of cadre deployment, more than 900 engineering and technical cadres have been registered and transferred to basic construction positions in various parts of the Southwest. The engineering and technical cadres of each enterprise management bureau will also be used centrally. It has also been decided to strengthen the leadership of specialized colleges to train basic construction talents.

    The basic construction projects in the Northwest Region this year are being accelerated for completion. Among the 58 construction projects started later this year by the Northwest Engineering Company, five have been completed by the end of October, and the rest have completed 50% to 90% of the plan. From July to October, the progress of the project has been increasing month by month. In order to complete all the major basic construction projects this year before the ground freezes, so as to more actively prepare for next year's basic construction, the Northwest District Financial and Economic Committee issued instructions, and the Northwest Engineering General Management Office Preparatory Office also made specific arrangements, focusing on solving the problems of material supply, improving project quality, and strengthening the safety of high-altitude operations. The Northwest Construction Engineering Company originally had three work groups that regularly inspected the construction situation. Recently, it also held a joint meeting of the captains of each work team to comprehensively check the progress of the project. After the meeting, a special inspection team was organized to inspect the construction site, classify the projects according to their nature, and divide them into three categories: those that must be completed, those that should be strived for completion, and those that should be postponed to next year. The workers were mobilized to calculate the detailed accounts, formulate a progress plan, and reallocate manpower. Technical workers were assigned to the important projects that must be completed this year, and the quantity and quality that each worker should complete were determined. After these works, it is estimated that the major construction projects in the Northwest can be completed within the year.

    In addition, the basic construction construction units in Taiyuan City launched a competition in early November to strive for a wonderful completion before the freeze-up, and achieved great results. It is estimated that before the freeze-up, more than 80% of the city's annual basic construction tasks can be completed.

    Due to the impact of the "Three-Anti" Movement, the general design and construction of basic construction projects in various units in Taiyuan City only started between June and July. However, due to the unified use of forces, the increase in workers, and especially the vigorous promotion of various advanced experiences in basic construction, the labor efficiency increased by an average of more than 15%. In the four months to the end of October, the construction units in the city have completed nearly 70% of the annual construction tasks. Recently, the weather has gradually become cold, and there has been a slack mood among the workers. Nearly half of the workers have asked to go home, and the cadres are also holding the idea of completing as much as they can; in addition, there are difficulties in the lack of transportation capacity and the failure to supply materials continuously. This affects the completion of this year's basic construction tasks, and will also affect the completion of larger basic construction tasks next year.

    At the end of October, the Taiyuan Municipal People's Government Financial and Economic Committee convened a meeting of relevant units to check the above-mentioned major difficulties existing in the construction, study solutions, and call on all units to support each other and strive for a wonderful completion before the freeze-up. Afterwards, all units mobilized the broad masses of workers, and the construction site groups launched a competition to strive for a wonderful completion before the freeze-up. In the competition, each unit formulated a plan according to its own different situation. Those who could complete all of them completed all of them, and those who could not complete all of them concentrated their main forces on completing key projects. All units also supported each other under the overall concept. For example, Taiyuan City Transportation Company organized the semi-commercial transportation forces in the suburbs to invest in transportation; Taiyuan City Real Estate Company allocated 400,000 bricks remaining this year to the steel plant that was building dormitories and lacked bricks; among the eight engineering teams of Taiyuan Construction Company, the second, third, fourth, and seventh engineering teams, which were constructed earlier, extracted more than 20 groups to support the fifth engineering team, which was constructed later. This greatly accelerated the completion of the construction tasks.

### 西南西北等地进行各种部署  加强领导基本建设工作

    西南西北等地进行各种部署
    加强领导基本建设工作
    据新华社讯：为迎接即将到来的全国大规模经济建设任务，西南、西北等地正以各种部署，大力加强对基本建设工作的领导。
    西南区对于即将大规模开始的基本建设工作，已作了重要的部署。在组织机构方面，西南区财政经济委员会将设立基本建设处，统一领导全区基本建设工作。各企业管理局和各厂矿的基本建设单位要从相当的生产单位独立开来，并限期于十一月底完成这一工作。各局根据基本建设任务的性质、大小、缓急不同，除普遍设立基本建设处和设计处外，有色金属、兵工、钢铁、电业等局还要设立工程公司，有色金属、兵工、钢铁、煤矿等并设立地质机构。所有的基本建设单位，不论是新建或改进，都要成为独立的会计、财务管理、经济核算的单位。在干部调配方面，日前西南各地已登记抽调到基本建设岗位上来的工程技术干部有九百多人。各企业管理局的工程技术干部也将集中使用。并决定加强对专科学校的领导，以培养基本建设人材。
    西北区今年的基本建设工程，正在加速完成中。西北工程公司今年开工较迟的五十八处建筑工程中，截至十月底止已有五处完工，其余也已完成计划百分之五十到九十。从七月到十月，工程进度是逐月上升的。为了在上冻以前全部完成今年各主要基本建设工程，以便更主动地做好明年基本建设的准备工作，西北区财政经济委员会特发出指示，西北工程总管理处筹备处也作了具体布置，着重解决材料供应、提高工程质量、加强高空作业的安全等问题。西北建筑工程公司原来就有三个工作组经常巡回检查施工情况，最近又召开了各工作队队长联席会议，全盘检查工程进展情况。会后并组织了一个特别检查组，到工地进行检查，按工程的性质进行排队，分为必须完成、争取完成、推到明年完成的三类，发动职工算细账，订出进度计划，重新调配人力，对今年必须完成的重要工程都加派了技术工人，确定每个工人应完成的数量、质量。经过这些工作，预计西北各主要建筑工程年内可以完成。
    又讯：太原市各基本建设施工单位于十一月初展开争取封冻前精彩完工的竞赛，成绩很大。估计到封冻以前，全市全年各项基本建设任务可完成百分之八十以上。
    太原市全年的各项基本建设工作，因“三反”运动的影响，各单位对基本建设工程的一般设计、施工都在六七月间才开始，但是由于统一使用力量，增加工人，特别是大力推广基本建设中的各种先进经验，劳动效率平均提高百分之十五以上。到十月底四个多月时间内，全市各施工单位已完成全年施工任务近百分之七十。最近，天气渐渐寒冷，职工中滋长着松懈情绪，近半数工人要求回家，干部也抱着完成多少算多少的思想；此外，还存在着运输力缺乏和材料不能源源供应的困难。这就影响着今年基本建设任务的完成，也将影响明年更大的基本建设任务的完成。
    十月底，太原市人民政府财政经济委员会召集各有关单位开会，检查了施工中存在的上述主要困难，研究了解决办法，号召各单位互相支援，争取封冻前精彩完工。随后各单位就在广大职工中进行动员，各工地小组互相展开了争取封冻前精彩完工的竞赛。竞赛中各单位根据本单位不同情况订出计划，能全部完成的就完成，不能全部完成的就集中主要力量完成重点工程。各单位并在整体观念下互相支援，如太原市搬运公司组织了市郊半营业的运输力量投入运输；太原市地产公司将今年所剩的四十万块砖拨给正在建筑宿舍而缺砖的钢厂用；太原建筑公司的八个工程队中，施工较早的第二、三、四、七工程队抽出二十多个小组支援施工较晚的第五工程队。这样就大大加速了建筑任务的完成。
