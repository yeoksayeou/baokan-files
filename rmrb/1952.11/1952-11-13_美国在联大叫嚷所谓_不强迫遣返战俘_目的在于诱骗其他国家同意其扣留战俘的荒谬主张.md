Xinhua News Agency, December 12th: The United States government is currently clamoring for the so-called principle of "no forced repatriation of prisoners of war" at the United Nations General Assembly. The U.S. government is attempting to use this slightly altered tactic to induce other countries to agree with its actions of forcibly detaining prisoners of war and undermining the armistice negotiations, so as to impose its policy of expanding the war on them.

On October 16th, U.S. Secretary of State Acheson delivered a speech at the Seventh United Nations General Assembly, openly declaring that if the Korean and Chinese side did not accept the U.S. government's "fair conditions," the Korean War would continue to be fought. On October 24th, Acheson submitted a proposal to the Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly, requesting its adoption by the United Nations General Assembly. In this proposal, Acheson requested other countries to approve all the U.S. government's sabotage and absurd principles of prisoner repatriation in the Korean armistice negotiations. This proposal also required the Korean and Chinese side to agree to a "condition for the armistice," which is to "avoid the use of force in repatriation."

On November 7th, the U.S. government's spokesperson at the United Nations reaffirmed that in the U.S. government's attitude toward the Korean issue, the claim of "no forced repatriation of prisoners of war" is "absolutely firm."

It is clear from the U.S. government's proposal that the reason the U.S. government is clamoring for "no forced repatriation of prisoners of war" is because its absurd principle of "voluntary repatriation" has completely failed. From the very beginning of the discussions on the issue of prisoners of war in the Korean armistice negotiations, the U.S. government insisted on the absurd claim of "voluntary repatriation," but this claim so obviously violated all international conventions and international agreements that even its puppet states, such as Britain, France, and Canada, could not help but believe that "refusing to repatriate 'all' prisoners of war may violate the Geneva Convention." The series of prisoner of war massacre incidents in the U.S. prisoner of war camps caused by the forced detention of prisoners of war made this claim even more untenable. Faced with the ironclad facts, the U.S. government itself felt that this "voluntary repatriation" claim was untenable and had to abandon it. From the administrative meeting of the delegations of both sides of the armistice negotiations in July, the U.S. side repackaged this absurd claim, changing it to the so-called "no forced repatriation of prisoners of war." The U.S. government is now bringing this argument to the United Nations General Assembly to make a big fuss, thinking that it can cover up its conspiracy to forcibly detain prisoners of war with this kind of word game.

In fact, the deceptive nature of the U.S. government's proposal is very obvious. Article 118 of the Geneva Convention stipulates that "prisoners of war shall be released and repatriated without delay after the cessation of active hostilities." Article 7 further stipulates that "prisoners of war may not renounce in part or in entirety the rights secured to them by the present Convention, and, as the case may be, by the Special Agreements referred to in the foregoing Article." Therefore, it is their inalienable right for prisoners of war to be repatriated to their country after the armistice. The belligerent countries have obligations stipulated to them by international conventions after the armistice to "release and repatriate" all the prisoners of war they detain to the other party. There is no question of "coercion" here at all, because everyone knows that prisoners of war are under the control of the enemy's military force, and removing this military control and allowing them to be repatriated home is something they absolutely welcome, without the need for any coercion.

The U.S. government hypocritically says that it cannot use force to "forcibly repatriate prisoners of war," but in fact, the U.S. government is using force to prevent prisoners of war from being repatriated. The countless prisoner of war massacre incidents that have occurred in U.S. prisoner of war camps have fully demonstrated this. Just a few days ago, the U.S. side inadvertently revealed that those who were listed as "civilians" and detained on Pongam Island were originally "North Korean prisoners of war." Twenty-one of these prisoners of war were injured for opposing the U.S. forced detention of them. The ironclad facts prove that the U.S. government's claim of "no forced repatriation" is just a fig leaf to cover up its detention of prisoners of war. This claim is in complete violation of the Geneva Convention. The Geneva Convention specifically stipulates that prisoners of war may not, under any circumstances, renounce their right to be repatriated, precisely to prevent the detention of prisoners of war under any pretext.

In the final analysis, the U.S. government's so-called "no forced repatriation of prisoners of war" claim is a replica of the notorious "voluntary repatriation." The U.S. government is asking the United Nations General Assembly to recognize this claim, with nothing more than the intention to use this claim to detain Korean and Chinese prisoners of war and drive them to slaughter their own brothers, to realize the U.S. conspiracy of "using Asians to fight Asians." The people of the world must be vigilant against this conspiracy of the U.S. government and not allow it to be realized.

### 美国在联大叫嚷所谓“不强迫遣返战俘”  目的在于诱骗其他国家同意其扣留战俘的荒谬主张

    美国在联大叫嚷所谓“不强迫遣返战俘”
    目的在于诱骗其他国家同意其扣留战俘的荒谬主张
    【新华社十二日讯】美国政府现在正在联合国大会上叫嚷所谓“不强迫遣返战俘”的原则。美国政府企图用这种换汤不换药的手法，诱使其他国家同意它的强迫扣留战俘、破坏停战谈判的行为，以便把美国扩大战争的政策，强加于它们。
    十月十六日，美国国务卿艾奇逊在第七届联合国大会上发表演说，公然声称如果朝中方面不接受美国政府的“公正的条件”，朝鲜战争就还要一直打下去。十月二十四日，艾奇逊在联合国大会政治委员会上提出了一项提案，要求联合国大会通过。艾奇逊在这个提案中要求其他国家批准美国政府在朝鲜停战谈判中的一切破坏行为和荒谬的遣俘原则。这个提案还要求朝中方面同意这样一个“停战条件”，这就是“避免在遣返当中使用武力”。
    十一月七日，美国政府在联合国中的发言人重新申明：在美国政府对朝鲜问题的态度中，“不强迫遣返战俘”的主张是“绝对坚定的”。
    从美国政府的提案中可以清楚地看出，美国政府之所以叫嚷“不强迫遣返战俘”，是因为它的“自愿遣返”的荒谬原则已经彻底破产。美国政府从朝鲜停战谈判中有关战俘问题的讨论一开始，就坚持“自愿遣返”的荒谬主张，但这个主张是如此明显地违反一切国际惯例和国际公约，以致它的仆从国家如英国、法国和加拿大，也不能不认为“拒绝遣返‘全部’战俘可能破坏日内瓦公约”。在美方战俘营中因强迫扣留战俘而引起的一连串屠杀战俘事件，更使这个主张站不住脚。在铁的事实面前，美国政府自己也觉得这个“自愿遣返”的主张站不住脚，不得不将它抛弃。从七月份停战谈判双方代表团大会行政性会议开始，美方就将这个荒谬主张改头换面，换了一个所谓“不强迫遣返战俘”的说法。美国政府现在又将这个论调拿到联合国大会上来大加搬弄，以为用这种文字游戏，就可以掩盖它的强迫扣留战俘的阴谋。
    其实，美国政府的提案的欺骗性质是十分明显的。日内瓦公约第一一八条规定：“实际战事停止后，战俘应即予释放并遣返，不得迟延。”第七条更规定：“在任何情况下战俘不得放弃本公约或上条所述特别协定——如其订有是项协定——所赋予彼等权利之一部或全部。”因此，战俘在停战以后被遣返回国，这是他们的不可剥夺的权利。交战国在停战以后有国际公约给它们规定的义务将所拘留的全部战俘“释放并遣送”给对方，这里根本不存在什么“强迫”的问题，因为谁都知道，战俘是在敌方武力控制之下的，解除这种武力控制，使他们被遣返回家，是他们所绝对欢迎，用不着任何强迫的。
    美国政府伪善地说它不能用武力“强迫遣返战俘”，但是事实上美国政府却在用武力强迫战俘不得遣返。在美方战俘营中发生的无数次屠杀战俘事件已经充分说明了这一点。就在几天以前，美方还无意中透露被他们列为“平民”而拘留在蜂岩岛上的原来都是“北朝鲜战俘”。这些战俘因为反对美方强迫扣留他们而有二十一人被打伤。铁一般的事实证明：美国政府的“不强迫遣返”的主张，只是一种用来掩饰它扣留战俘的遮羞布。这种主张是完全违反日内瓦公约的。日内瓦公约正是为了防止用任何借口扣留战俘，才规定战俘不得在任何情况下放弃其被遣返的权利。
    归根结蒂，美国政府的所谓“不强迫遣返战俘”的主张，就是臭名远扬的“自愿遣返”的翻版。美国政府要求联合国大会承认这个主张，无非是企图用这个主张来扣留朝中战俘，并驱策他们去残杀他们自己的弟兄，实现美国“用亚洲人打亚洲人”的阴谋。全世界人民必须警惕美国政府的这一阴谋，不许它实现。
