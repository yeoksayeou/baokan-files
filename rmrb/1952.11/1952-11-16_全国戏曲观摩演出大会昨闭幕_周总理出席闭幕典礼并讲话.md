Xinhua News Agency, 15th. The closing ceremony of the first National Opera Observation Performance Festival, sponsored by the Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government, was grandly held at Huairentang, the capital, at 8 p.m. on the 14th. At the meeting, the list of winners of the observation performance was announced. Premier Zhou Enlai of the State Council of the Central People's Government attended the meeting and spoke to all the opera workers from all over the country who participated in the observation performance in Beijing.

The closing ceremony was presided over by Shen Yanbing, Minister of Culture of the Central Government. Those attending the ceremony included Ma Xulun, Deputy Director of the Cultural and Educational Committee of the State Council, Zhou Yang and Ding Xilin, Deputy Ministers of Culture of the Central Government, responsible cadres of central and major administrative regions, provincial and municipal cultural administrative organs, opera workers from twenty-three opera genres from all over the country who came to Beijing to participate in the observation performance, and representatives from various literary and art work units in the capital, totaling more than 1,800 people.

At 2 p.m. on the 8th, Zhou Yang, Deputy Minister of Culture of the Central Government, gave a summary report on the National Opera Observation Performance Festival to all opera workers participating in the observation performance. Zhou Yang systematically reported on the significance and gains of the observation performance, how to inherit and carry forward the excellent traditions of national opera, how to promote the spirit of realism in opera art, how to create national new opera on the basis of reforming and developing national opera, and how to strengthen the leadership of opera undertakings to unite the vast number of opera workers to better serve the people. He pointed out that twenty-three major opera genres from all over the country participated in this observation performance, with more than ninety repertoires staged and more than 1,600 opera workers participating in the performance. It was the first time in the history of Chinese drama that national operas had been exhibited in such a large scale. This performance was an important learning experience for opera workers, enhancing their understanding of the rich national opera heritage and broadening their artistic horizons. He analyzed the strong popular and realistic spirit of Chinese opera, and at the same time pointed out that in order to express the new life of the increasingly progressive people of our country, opera art must also undergo appropriate reforms in all aspects. In the work of opera reform, both conservative ideas and crude styles are undesirable. He especially criticized the violation of policies in some areas where dramas were arbitrarily banned without the approval of the central government, as well as the erroneous attitude of disrespecting one's own national heritage by arbitrarily changing old scripts. He encouraged opera workers across the country to unite closely, learn from each other, and work together to advance national opera art to a new stage.

At 8 p.m., Premier Zhou Enlai arrived at the venue. The audience stood up and paid their respects, and applauded and cheered enthusiastically for more than ten minutes.

Premier Zhou, with his deep concern for national opera art and the vast number of opera workers, spoke for two hours at the meeting. He gave a detailed explanation of Chairman Mao's policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, weed through the old to bring forth the new" for opera reform. Premier Zhou's speech gave great encouragement to the opera workers present. He attended the conference until the end, and took photos with all the winners and veteran artists present.

Ma Xulun, Deputy Director of the Cultural and Educational Committee of the State Council, spoke at the meeting, encouraging the vast number of opera workers to strengthen their study of politics and professional work in order to improve their ideological and artistic level; he hoped that new literary and art workers and opera workers would learn from each other and cooperate with each other, and on the basis of the victory of this observation performance, strive to create, adapt and perform more and better works to encourage the people to participate in the enthusiasm for national economic construction and cultural construction.

Ouyang Yuqian, President of the Central Academy of Drama, said: This observation performance festival shows that unity is strength. It is hoped that in the future, opera workers of various genres across the country, and opera workers and new literary and art workers will unite and cooperate more closely.

Lü Ji, Vice President of the Central Conservatory of Music, said: In the past, the attitude of new music workers not caring about opera work was wrong. In the future, we will definitely cooperate with opera workers with practical actions and jointly shoulder the responsibility of building China's national new opera.

Next, Ma Yanxiang, Deputy Director of the Art Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Culture of the Central Government, announced the list of winners of the first National Opera Observation Performance Festival (list to be issued separately).

After the list was announced, Minister Shen Yanbing presented certificates to all the winning opera workers on the spot.

In order to express respect to these outstanding opera workers who have won national awards, the audience applauded and cheered enthusiastically again and again.

Representatives of the winning opera workers, Mei Lanfang, Gai Jiaotian, Yin Xi, and Jia Peizhi, spoke at the meeting, unanimously stating that the glorious award received by opera workers today should be attributed to the Communist Party and Chairman Mao. The Communist Party and Chairman Mao liberated opera workers from the position of being played with and insulted, and made opera workers artists who are respected. It is also Chairman Mao's literary and artistic direction and the instruction of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, weed through the old to bring forth the new" that have enabled opera art to achieve certain achievements and development in the past three years. They all expressed that they would work hard to study, strengthen unity, and better serve the people.

All the opera workers participating in the first National Opera Observation Performance Festival unanimously passed a telegram to Chairman Mao, expressing their heartfelt gratitude to Chairman Mao for his noble concern for them.

At this time, more than 100 literary and art workers from various literary and art groups in the capital rushed to the rostrum to present flowers to the winning opera workers. The venue resounded with storms of applause again.

The closing ceremony ended after Ding Xilin, Deputy Minister of Culture of the Central Government, delivered the closing speech. (Attached picture)

    周总理出席闭幕典礼并讲话
    【新华社十五日讯】中央人民政府文化部主办的第一届全国戏曲观摩演出大会的闭幕典礼于十四日晚八时在首都怀仁堂隆重举行。会上宣布了观摩演出的获奖名单。中央人民政府政务院总理周恩来曾出席向全国各地来京参加观摩演出的全体戏曲工作者讲话。
    闭幕典礼由中央文化部部长沈雁冰主持。参加典礼的有政务院文化教育委员会副主任马叙伦，中央文化部副部长周扬、丁西林，中央和各大行政区、省、市文化行政机关的负责干部，全国各地来京参加观摩演出的二十三个剧种的戏曲工作者，以及首都各文艺工作单位的代表等共一千八百多人。
    八日下午二时，中央文化部副部长周扬曾向参加观摩演出的全体戏曲工作者作了全国戏曲观摩演出大会的总结报告。周扬就观摩演出的意义和收获、如何继承和发扬民族戏曲的优良传统、如何发扬戏曲艺术中的现实主义精神、如何在改革和发展民族戏曲的基础上创造民族新歌剧、以及如何加强对戏曲事业的领导以团结广大戏曲工作者更好地为人民服务等问题作了系统的报告。他指出这次观摩演出有全国各地二十三个主要的剧种参加，上演剧目九十多个，参加演出的戏曲工作者一千六百多人。像这样大规模地把民族戏曲集中展览，在中国戏剧史上还是第一次。这次演出对戏曲工作者是一次重要的学习，增进了对丰富的民族戏曲遗产的认识，也扩大了艺术创造的眼界。他分析了中国戏曲所具有的强烈的人民性和现实主义精神，同时指出为了表现我国日益前进的人民的新的生活，戏曲艺术还必须在各方面进行适当的改革。在戏曲改革工作上，保守观念和粗暴作风，都是要不得的。他特别批评了有些地区未经中央批准任意禁戏的违反政策的行为以及乱改旧有剧本的那种对自己民族遗产毫不尊重的错误态度。他勉励全国的戏曲工作者亲密团结，互相学习，共同努力，把民族戏曲艺术推进到一个新的阶段。
    晚八时，周恩来总理到达会场。全场起立致敬，并热烈地鼓掌欢呼达十多分钟之久。
    周总理以他对民族戏曲艺术和广大戏曲工作者的深切的关怀，在会上讲了两小时的话。他对毛主席所指示的“百花齐放，推陈出新”的戏曲改革工作方针，作了详尽的阐释。周总理的讲话给了到会的戏曲工作者以极大的鼓舞。他参加大会直到结束，并和全体获奖者及到会的老艺人一同摄影。
    政务院文化教育委员会副主任马叙伦在会上讲话，他勉励广大戏曲工作者加强学习政治和业务，以提高思想艺术水平；他希望新文艺工作者和戏曲工作者互相学习、共同合作，在这次观摩演出的胜利基础上，努力创作、改编和演出更多更好的作品，以鼓舞人民参加祖国经济建设和文化建设的热情。
    中央戏剧学院院长欧阳予倩讲话说：这次观摩演出大会表示了团结就是力量，希望今后全国各剧种的戏曲工作者之间，戏曲工作者和新文艺工作者之间要更加亲密地团结合作。
    中央音乐学院副院长吕骥讲话说：从前新音乐工作者不关心戏曲工作的态度是错误的，今后我们一定以实际的行动来和戏曲工作者合作，共同负担起建设我国民族新歌剧的责任。
    接着，中央文化部艺术事业管理局副局长马彦祥宣读了第一届全国戏曲观摩演出大会获奖名单（名单另发）。
    宣读名单后，沈雁冰部长当场对获奖的全部戏曲工作者颁发奖状。
    为了对这些荣获国家奖励的优秀的戏曲工作者表示敬意，全场曾一次又一次热烈地鼓掌和欢呼。
    获奖的戏曲工作者的代表梅兰芳、盖叫天、尹羲、贾培之等在会上讲话，一致表示今天戏曲工作者得到这样光荣的奖励，应该感谢共产党和毛主席。共产党和毛主席把戏曲工作者从被人玩弄侮辱的地位中解放出来，使戏曲工作者成为被人尊重的艺术家。也是毛主席的文艺方向和“百花齐放，推陈出新”的指示使戏曲艺术在三年来获得了一定的成就和发展。他们都表示要努力学习、加强团结，更好地为人民服务。
    参加第一届全国戏曲观摩演出大会的全体戏曲工作者一致通过了向毛主席致敬的电文，表示衷心感谢毛主席对他们的崇高的关怀。
    这时，首都各文艺团体的一百多个文艺工作者涌上主席台，向获奖的戏曲工作者献花。会场又响起暴风雨一样的掌声。
    闭幕典礼在中央文化部副部长丁西林致闭幕词后结束。（附图片）
