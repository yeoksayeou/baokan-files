Xinhua News Agency, Jinhua Front, Korea, 22nd – After the glorious battle in the Shangganling area north of Jinhua began, the Korean people near the front lines spontaneously rose to support their protectors – the Chinese People's Volunteers. Korean Labor Party members and farmers from places like Gongdong-ri, Meihui-ri, Langxia-ri, Shanggong-ri, Shangxia Songguan-ri, and others, organized a stretcher team of more than 30 stretchers and rushed to the front line shortly after the battle began to rescue wounded Volunteer soldiers. Carrying stretchers, they traversed the enemy's artillery blockade lines, crossed high mountains and steep ridges, and transported wounded Volunteer soldiers from the front-line aid stations to field hospitals over 100 li away. On the way, they warmly cared for the wounded soldiers, providing them with boiling water, treating them like their own family. They used gestures to ask the wounded about their well-being, and the wounded shared news of the victories on the front lines with them. After they delivered the wounded to the field hospital, the soldiers would always say with gratitude, "Abaji (old uncle), you are so good, thank you!"

Korean women near the front lines also enthusiastically helped the Volunteer Army. The women of Meihui-ri set up support-the-front tea stations along the road to the front line. Braving the cold wind, they boiled water for the wounded Volunteer soldiers, transporters, and stretcher bearers coming and going, and posted slogans at the tea stations such as "Thank you to the heroic Chinese People's Volunteers" and "Long Live Sino-Korean Friendship." These strong Korean women said, "The Volunteer Army is fighting for us, so we should work harder to support the Volunteer Army!"

The enthusiastic support of the Korean people greatly encourages the Volunteer soldiers fighting on the Shangganling front lines, and they are fighting even more bravely to strike at the invading enemy forces.

Xinhua News Agency, 22nd – The heavy casualties suffered by the US military and the Rhee Syngman (South Korean) puppet army in the Jinhua area of Korea continue to be revealed in reports from American journalists.

Associated Press reporter Randolph reported from the Jinhua front on the 19th: "Unless some sudden and noteworthy change occurs in the future, the sacrifices in the 37-day battle for the Jinhua mountain ridges are so great that they deserve closer attention.

Due to censorship, specific casualty figures cannot be published. What can be reported is that the intensity of the fighting when the United Nations forces defended Sniper Ridge and Triangle Hill was almost similar to the situation of certain historic battles during World War II."

Randolph said, "Those Allied officers on the front lines who must order their troops to carry out the slaughter again are now very saddened by such staggering losses. Those units that set out with full strength in the morning now return with only a pitiful few remnants, and the officers cry when they see this situation.

Many combat infantry companies have now been replenished with many new recruits – the most capable and bravest officers and sergeants have either died or been wounded.

The only places that are still being held today are a few hundred yards of shell-torn rocks and sand on Sniper Ridge, and a small portion of Jenny Ruth Hill. Other places that were once captured have now been lost – all of Triangle Hill, all of Pike Hill, most of Jenny Ruth Hill, and all of York Hill on the periphery of Sniper Ridge."

Randolph said that the outcome of the Jinhua mountain ridge battle was completely unexpected by Van Fleet. He said, "The great sacrifices in the Jinhua mountain ridge battle cannot be attributed to any individual or any unit, ... not even to the officers who commanded them, who are generally cautious and competent. This is entirely a cruel fact produced by the battle itself and difficult to predict."

Randolph said that Van Fleet's offensive in the Jinhua area this time was meticulously planned. "After multi-party consultations at all levels of command from the regimental headquarters to the Eighth Army headquarters, the order to begin the offensive was given," and he specially selected "Lieutenant General Jenkins, commander of the US Ninth Corps, to take overall command. He is a veteran who served under Van Fleet with the US military in Greece (referring to helping the Greek royalist fascist government attack the Greek people)."

However, this "veteran" suffered a major defeat as soon as he took the field. He withdrew the remnants of the US military from the battle and handed over the "entire combat mission to the Republic of Korea Army (referring to the Rhee Syngman puppet army)," thereby causing the Rhee Syngman puppet army to "suffer heavy casualties" as well.

Based on the above cruel facts of heavy sacrifices, Randolph concluded: "The time has come – possibly already passed – for the Allied forces to reconsider their strategy and tactics in this theater of war."

    朝鲜人民热烈支援上甘岭志愿军
    美国通讯社继续透露美李军在金化前线遭到惨重伤亡
    【新华社朝鲜金化前线二十二日电】在金化以北上甘岭地区的光辉战斗开始后，临近这一带战线的朝鲜人民纷纷自动起来支援自己的保卫者——中国人民志愿军。共洞里、梅会里、浪下里、上贡里、上下松馆里等地朝鲜劳动党员和农民们组织的一个有三十多付担架的担架队，在战斗打响后不久就赶到前线去救护志愿军伤员。他们抬着担架，穿过敌人的炮火封锁线，翻越高山峻岭，把志愿军伤员从前线救护所送到一百里以外的野战医院。在路上，他们热情地照顾着伤员，给伤员送开水，把伤员当作自己的亲人。他们比着手势向伤员们问长问短，伤员们也把前线的胜利消息告诉他们。他们把伤员送到野战医院以后，伤员们总是感动地说：“阿巴基（老大爷），你们真好，谢谢你！”
    临近火线地区的朝鲜妇女们也都热烈地帮助志愿军。梅会里的妇女们在通往火线的路上设置了支前茶水站，她们冒着寒风给来来往往的志愿军伤员、运输员和担架队员们烧开水，并且在茶水站上贴着“感谢英雄的中国人民志愿军”“朝中友谊万岁”等标语。这些坚强的朝鲜妇女们说：“志愿军为我们打仗，我们更应该努力支援志愿军！”
    朝鲜人民的热情支援，对在上甘岭前线作战的志愿军战士们的鼓舞很大，他们在战斗中更加英勇地打击着进犯的敌军。
    【新华社二十二日讯】美军和李伪军在朝鲜金化地区遭到惨重伤亡的情况，继续从美国记者的报道里透露出来。
    美联社记者伦多夫十九日自金化前线报道说：“除非将来发生某种突然引人注意的变化，打了三十七天的金化山岭争夺战的牺牲之大，是值得人们更密切的注意的。
    由于新闻检查，不能发表具体的伤亡数字，所能报告的是：联合国军防守狙击兵岭和三角山阵地时战况的激烈，简直与第二次世界大战时某些历史性战役的情况相仿。”
    伦多夫说：“那些必须命令他们的部队重新进行屠杀的前线上的联军军官们，现在看到这样惊人的损失，非常伤心。那些出发时兵力都是足额的全连的部队，在今晨回来时只剩下少得可怜的几个残余，那些军官看到这种情形简直哭了起来。
    许多战斗步兵连里，现在都补充了许多新兵——最精干最勇敢的军官和军士们都已死的死、伤的伤。
    今天仍在据守着的夺得的地方，只有狙击兵岭上被炮弹打得不成样子的几百码石块和沙土的阵地，以及珍妮露赛山的一小部分。其他一度夺得的地方现在都已丢掉——三角山的全部，派克山的全部，珍妮露赛山的大部分，狙击兵岭外围约克山的全部。”
    伦多夫说，金化山岭战役的结果完全出于范佛里特意料之外，他说：“金化山岭战役牺牲之大，并不能归咎于任何个人或任何部队，……甚至不能归咎于指挥他们作战的在一般上讲都很谨慎而能胜任的军官们。这完全是一件由战斗的本身所产生而难于预料的残酷事实。”
    伦多夫说，范佛里特这次在金化地区发动进攻是经过极周密计划的，“从团部到第八军总部，经过各级指挥多方磋商以后，才下令开始进攻”，而且还特别选派“美国第九兵团司令詹金斯中将全面指挥，他是一个曾在范佛里特的手下随美军到希腊服过役的（指曾帮助希腊保皇法西斯政府进攻希腊人民）老资格的军人”。
    然而，这位“老资格军人”一上阵就打了大败仗，他把美军残部撤出战斗，将“整个战斗任务交给大韩民国军（指李承晚伪军）来进行”，从而使李承晚伪军也“遭到重大伤亡”。
    根据上述牺牲惨重的冷酷的事实，伦多夫得出结论说：“现在已经到了——可能已经过了——联军应该重新考虑他们在这个战区的战略与战术的时候了。”
