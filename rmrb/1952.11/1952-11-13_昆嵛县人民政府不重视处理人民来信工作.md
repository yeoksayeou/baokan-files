    Kunyu County People's Government Does Not Value Handling People's Letters

    To the Editor: Since the Central People's Government's Government Administration Council announced the decision on handling people's letters and receiving the people in 1951, the Kunyu County People's Government in Shandong Province still does not value handling people's letters and receiving the people.

    The Secretariat of the County People's Government, which is specifically responsible for handling people's letters and receiving the people, should have a dedicated person in charge, but in reality, it is only a part-time "agent." In 1951, it was "handled" by the County Procuratorate; in 1952, it was "handled" by the Assistant Secretary of the Secretariat for two months, and then by the Clerk of the Secretariat. All these "agents" actually only "forwarded" the letters, and very few were directly handled, or they only performed a "receiving and sending" procedure. In fact, even "forwarding" was not timely, and some were delayed for three or four months, or even a year. For example, in August 1951, the Shandong Provincial People's Government Office forwarded a people's letter reflecting land reform issues to the county, which was "handled" by the County Procuratorate, but it was shelved for a year without being "handled." The Provincial People's Government urged them twice, but they ignored it. Later, it was not dealt with until August 1952. From January to September 1952, the County People's Government received a total of 148 people's letters, of which only 33 were "handled"; among them, 59 letters reflected corruption and violations of law by district, township, and village cadres during the "Three-Anti" movement, but only two were "handled" by the County "Three-Anti" Office and one by the County Procuratorate. The attitude towards handling was not consultation between relevant departments, but mutual shirk of responsibility. I suggest that the Kunyu County People's Government thoroughly examine and improve this work.

### 昆嵛县人民政府不重视处理人民来信工作

    昆嵛县人民政府不重视处理人民来信工作
    编辑同志：一九五一年中央人民政府政务院公布关于处理人民来信和接见人民工作的决定以后，山东省昆嵛县人民政府对处理人民来信和接见人民工作还是没有重视。
    具体处理人民来信和接见人民的该县人民政府秘书室，本应该设专人负责，但结果却只是兼职“代办”。一九五一年由该县检察署“代办”；一九五二年由该秘书室助理秘书“代办”两个月后，又由该秘书室收发员“代办”。所有这些“代办”的人，实际上只是“转办”，直接办理的极少，或只等于做了一次“收发”手续。其实，“转办”也不及时，还有拖延三、四个月甚至一年未“转办”的。如一九五一年八月，山东省人民政府办公厅转给该县一件反映土地改革问题的人民来信，由该县检察署“代办”，压了一年未“办”；省人民政府曾经催办两次，也置之不理。后来，直到一九五二年八月才作了处理。从一九五二年一月到九月这一段期间来看，该县人民政府共收到人民来信一百四十八件，仅“处理”了三十三件；其中关于在“三反”运动时反映该县区、乡、村干部贪污违法等的五十九件，仅由该县“三反”办公室“处理”了两件，由该县检察署处理了一件。处理的态度，不是有关部门互相协商，而是互相推诿。我建议昆嵛县人民政府彻底检查并改进这一工作。
