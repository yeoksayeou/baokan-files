On the second day of learning pinyin,
Zhang Feng of the stretcher company encountered a new difficulty,
He was "moving house" in class,
Casually picking two letters to try to spell,
He followed the teacher's pronunciation,
Thinking pinyin wasn't too troublesome.
Back in the company he practiced on his own,
Asking group leader Xue Xinqing to listen and give him suggestions,
The more Xue Xinqing listened, the more he felt something was wrong,
Chai Shifu kept shaking his head,
Clearly "勹ㄢ" spells "班" (bān),
But Zhang Feng's pronunciation wasn't quite right.
He was so anxious that he kept reading, feeling flustered,
His throat was dry and he was sweating.
Why was it so easy for others to learn,
But so difficult for him?
That day his sister sent him a letter,
Zhang Feng asked the cultural instructor to read it,
The letter said:
"I'm doing very well in the factory,
I've already learned two thousand characters,
I can read books, newspapers and documents;
And I can even edit the wall newspaper in my spare time.
I wrote to Chairman Mao on 'July 1st',
Promising to increase production and practice economy to support the front lines.
This time I was elected a study model worker,
And I want to challenge you, my younger brother."

Zhang Feng couldn't sleep at night,
He was pondering things in his heart,
His sister could now read books and newspapers,
While he was still an illiterate.
Feeling somewhat unconvinced,
He picked up his pen and wrote happily.
First he wrote: "Respected Chairman Mao,
I hope you are in good health.
I'm fighting the devils in Korea,
And I often think of you:
Thinking of you gives me strength,
Thinking of you, I have no difficulties before me.
My sister is learning culture in the factory,
And now she has become a study model worker.
I also want to assure you,
That I will resolutely conquer the mountain of culture."
Then he wrote his name "Zhang Feng,
July 13, 1952."
He read it over and over again,
Feeling that it was very well written,
Thinking, "Sister, you don't need to challenge me,
I will also become a model worker soon."
Suddenly he heard the wake-up call,
It turned out that he was accepting the challenge in a dream.

As the saying goes, "No pain, no gain,"
If you don't work hard, you can't do anything.
Zhang Feng was determined to learn culture,
His throat was dry, he took a sip of water,
His head was dizzy, he rested for a while, then continued to practice.
After learning pinyin, he made a breakthrough in learning characters,
Learning one hundred and twenty-three characters in one day,
In just seven or eight days,
He learned a thousand characters.
"元" (yuan - dollar) like one yuan or two yuan,
Add a hat and it becomes "完" (wan - finished),
He remembered the character "完" like this,
Our work is "finished";
Add "王" (wang - king) next to "元" ,
After work is "finished", we go "play".
The method of remembering characters is truly good,
He learned one thousand five hundred characters in just fourteen days.
He looked up words he didn't know in the dictionary,
The "mute" teacher was easy to use.
One day, Zhang Feng wrote a reply to his sister,
Determined to accept the challenge with his sister,
Beginning by writing: "Reporting good news!
Writing this letter didn't bother the cultural instructor.
I can now read books and newspapers at a preliminary level;
And soon I can submit articles to the wall newspaper.
Let's both challenge each other,
And compete on the cultural front,
You have culture to learn technology,
I have culture to fight,
Master modern new weapons,
And eliminate the devils as soon as possible.
I won't say much more,
Wishing you progress and peace.
Your brother, Zhang Feng,
August 1st, in Korea."

    张峰应战（山东快书）
    （志愿军某部文化学习优胜小组张峰、柴世福、
    薛欣清集体创作；文工队翁永康整理）
    学拼音的第二天，
    担架连张峰碰到了新困难，
    课堂上学着把家搬，
    随便找两字拼拼看，
    教员发音他跟着念，
    觉着拼音不太麻烦。
    回到班里自己练，
    叫组长薛欣清听着给他提意见，
    薛欣清越听越不对，
    柴世福的脑袋直摇幌，
    明明“勹ㄢ”拼成“班”，
    张峰发音就是不全。
    急的他念来念去心里乱，
    嗓子发干头冒汗。
    为什么人家学起来很容易，
    自己学起来就这样难？
    这天他姐姐来了信，
    张峰去找文化教员念，
    信上说：
    “我在工厂里一切很好，
    两千单字已学完，
    能看书报和文件；
    空下来还能把墙报编。
    我‘七一’写信给毛主席，
    保证增产节约支援前线。
    这回我当选学习模范，
    要和弟弟你挑挑战。”
    ×    ×    ×
    张峰晚上睡不着觉，
    自己心里乱盘算，
    姐姐现在能看书报，
    自己却是个睁眼瞎汉。
    心里有些怪不服，
    拿出钢笔就写的欢。
    先写：“敬爱的毛主席，
    你的身体可健康。
    我在朝鲜打鬼子，
    时常把你来想念：
    想起你来我浑身有力量，
    想起你我面前没有困难。
    我姐姐在工厂学文化，
    现在她当了学习模范。
    我也向你来保证，
    坚决攻克文化山。”
    后写名字叫“张峰，
    一九五二年七月十三”。
    他反复地念了好几遍，
    觉得写的很好看，
    心想姐姐你不用挑战，
    不久我也会当模范。
    猛然听见了起床号，
    原来是在梦里来应战。
      ×    ×    ×
    俗语说先苦而后甜，
    不苦练啥都不能干。
    张峰决心来学文化，
    嗓子发干喝口水，
    头晕歇会儿他接着练。
    学完拼音突击生字，
    一天学会一百二十三，
    前后不过七八天，
    识了生字有一千。
    一元钱两元钱的“元”，
    戴上个帽子就念“完”，
    这个“完”字他这样记，
    咱们的工作已做“完”；
    元字旁加“王”字，
    工作做“完”去“玩玩”。
    记字方法真正好，
    一千五百字只学了十四天。
    不识的字他问字典，
    “哑叭”老师好使唤。
    一天张峰给他姐姐写回信，
    决心和姐姐来应战，
    开头先写：“报告好消息！
    写这信没麻烦文化教员。
    我现在初步能看书报；
    不久就可向墙报投稿件。
    咱们俩来挑战，
    文化战线上比比看，
    你有了文化学技术，
    我有了文化能作战，
    掌握近代化新武器，
    把鬼子早日消灭完。
    别的话我不多谈，
    祝你进步和平安。
    你的弟弟张峰上，
    八月一日于朝鲜”。
