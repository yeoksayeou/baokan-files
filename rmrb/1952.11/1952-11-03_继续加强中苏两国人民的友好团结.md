    Continue to Strengthen the Friendly Unity Between the Chinese and Soviet People
    Zhang Lan, Vice President of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association

    Since the victory of the October Socialist Revolution in the Soviet Union, a great friendship has been established between the Chinese and Soviet people. For more than thirty years, the Soviet Union has always been the most sincere friend of the Chinese people, providing material and spiritual support to the Chinese people's revolutionary cause. This assistance from the Soviet Union is one of the important conditions for the victory of the Chinese revolution. Chairman Mao has long said: "Only socialist countries, socialist leaders, socialist people, socialist thinkers, politicians, and laborers can truly assist the liberation cause of the Chinese nation and the Chinese people; and our cause cannot achieve final victory without their assistance."

    However, for a long period, foreign imperialists and domestic reactionaries, especially the later Kuomintang reactionary government, adopted various means to obstruct and undermine further cooperation between the Chinese and Soviet people. It was not until the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, carried out the Liberation War and eliminated the reactionary rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucrat capitalism in China, that the situation underwent a fundamental change. We established the People's Republic of China, forming an unprecedentedly unified and united country, with political power in the hands of the people. This made genuine cooperation between the Chinese and Soviet people possible. After consultations between Chairman Mao and Marshal Stalin, the deep friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people has been permanently established and consolidated through the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance in February 1950. The imperialist bloc headed by the United States can no longer damage or undermine the friendly relations between China and the Soviet Union.

    In the past three years, the Soviet government and the Soviet people, based on the founding principles of the Soviet state and the great spirit of the Sino-Soviet alliance, have provided our country with selfless assistance in all aspects. First of all, in all international struggles against imperialism, we have received the most powerful support from the Soviet Union. Not long ago, in order to prevent Japan and other countries colluding with it from carrying out aggression again, the Soviet government agreed to the proposal of our government to extend the period of joint Sino-Soviet use of the Lushunkou naval base. This is of extremely great significance for strengthening our country's security and consolidating the victory of the revolution. At the same time, Soviet assistance has played an extremely important role in our country's construction. It should be emphasized that Soviet assistance, whether in the economic or technical fields, is entirely based on the "principles of equality, mutual benefit, mutual respect for national sovereignty and territorial integrity, and non-interference in each other's internal affairs," and is entirely fraternal, sincere, and internationalist assistance. The reason why we have been able to smoothly and rapidly complete the economic recovery and reform work in just three years is inseparable from this selfless assistance from the Soviet Union. Therefore, when the people of the world are enthusiastically celebrating the 35th anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution, the people of our country should especially express our heartfelt gratitude and respect to the Soviet government and people, and to the great Marshal Stalin.

    The Soviet Union's assistance to the Chinese revolution in the past thirty years and more, and its assistance to the construction of New China in the recent three years, fully confirms Chairman Mao's brilliant thesis: "In the era of imperialism, the genuine people's revolution of any country cannot achieve its own victory without the assistance of international revolutionary forces in various different ways. Even if it wins, it cannot be consolidated."

    Now, our country is about to launch large-scale economic construction and cultural construction. We need to continue to obtain greater assistance from the Soviet Union. At the same time, we need a peaceful international environment to build our great motherland. However, the American aggressors are still delaying and sabotaging the Korean armistice negotiations, plotting to expand the war of aggression against Korea, still occupying our territory of Taiwan, and openly implementing a policy of reviving Japanese militarist forces. The peace of Asia and the security of our country are still under great threat. In order to prevent the danger of a new war and to ensure the success of our country's construction, we must continue to strengthen the Sino-Soviet friendly cooperative and mutual assistance alliance and continue to strengthen the friendly unity between the Chinese and Soviet people. This is the firm and unshakable common will of the people of our country.

    As everyone knows, the unity between the seven hundred million people of China and the Soviet Union is based on political unity and consistency, and therefore no one can separate it and it cannot be defeated. Let us, on the basis of this great friendship, strive for the further prosperity of China and the Soviet Union! Strive for the victory of world peace and justice! Strive for the liberation of all mankind!

    继续加强中苏两国人民的友好团结
    中苏友好协会总会副会长    张澜
    自从苏联十月社会主义革命胜利以来，中苏两国人民之间就建立了伟大的友谊。在三十几年中，苏联始终是中国人民的最真诚的朋友，曾对中国人民的革命事业给予了物质上和精神上的支持。苏联的这种援助，乃是中国革命取得胜利的重要条件之一。毛主席早就说过：“中华民族和中国人民的解放事业，只有社会主义的国家、社会主义的领袖，社会主义的人民，社会主义的思想家、政治家、劳动者，才能真正援助；而我们的事业，没有他们的援助是不能取得最后胜利的。”
    但是，在很长的一个时期内，外国帝国主义者和国内反动派，特别是后来的国民党反动政府，采取各种手段，阻挠和破坏中苏两国人民之间的进一步合作。直到中国人民在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，进行解放战争，消灭了帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义在中国的反动统治以后，形势才起了根本的变化。我们建立了中华人民共和国，形成了空前未有的统一团结的国家，政权掌握在人民的手里。这才使中苏两国人民有了真诚合作的可能。经过毛主席和斯大林大元帅的会商，中苏两国人民之间的深厚友谊，已由于一九五○年二月间中苏友好同盟互助条约的签订而永久地确定和巩固下来了。以美国为首的帝国主义集团，再也不可能损害或破坏中苏两国的友好关系了。
    三年来，苏联政府和苏联人民，根据苏维埃国家的立国原则，根据中苏友好同盟的伟大精神，在各方面给予了我国以大公无私的援助。首先是在反对帝国主义的一切国际斗争中，我们获得苏联的最有力的支持。不久以前，为了防止日本以及与之相勾结的其它国家重新进行侵略，苏联政府又同意我国政府的建议，延长中苏共同使用旅顺口海军根据地的期限。这对于加强我国的安全和巩固革命的胜利，有极其重大的意义。同时，苏联的援助对于我国的建设，更发挥了极其重要的作用。应该着重指出，苏联的援助，不论是经济方面的，或是技术方面的，都是完全根据“平等、互利、互相尊重国家主权与领土完整及不干涉对方内政的原则”，都是完全兄弟般的、真诚的、国际主义的援助。我们所以能够在短短三年内，顺利地、迅速地完成经济恢复和改革工作，是跟苏联的这种无私援助分不开的。因此，在全世界人民热烈庆祝伟大的十月社会主义革命三十五周年的时候，我国人民尤其要向苏联政府和人民，向伟大的斯大林大元帅表示衷心的感谢和敬意。
    苏联过去三十多年对中国革命的援助和最近三年来对新中国建设的援助，完全证实了毛主席英明的论断：“在帝国主义存在的时代，任何国家的真正的人民革命，如果没有国际革命力量在各种不同方式上的援助，要取得自己的胜利是不可能的。胜利了，要巩固，也是不可能的。”
    现在，我国即将展开大规模的经济建设和文化建设。我们需要继续取得苏联的更大的援助。与此同时，我们需要有和平的国际环境以建设我们伟大的祖国。但是，美国侵略者还在拖延和破坏朝鲜停战谈判，阴谋扩大侵朝战争，仍然霸占着我国的领土台湾，并明目张胆地实行复活日本的军国主义势力的政策。亚洲的和平和我国的安全仍然受到极大的威胁。为了防止新战争的危险，为了保证我国建设的成功，必须继续加强中苏友好合作互助同盟，继续加强中苏两国人民的友好团结。这是我全国人民坚定不移的共同意志。
    大家知道，中苏两国七万万人民之间的团结，是以政治上的团结一致为基础的，因而是没有人能够分离的，是不可能被战胜的。让我们在这个伟大友谊的基础上，为中苏两大国进一步的繁荣而奋斗！为全世界和平与正义的胜利而奋斗！为全人类的解放而奋斗！
