Xinhua News Agency, 10th: The head of the Soviet film artists delegation, Fedorov, and members Chirkov, Ladynina, Petrov, Smirnova, Pavlov, and others, attended three separate receptions in Beijing on the evening of the 9th. When the delegation members met with cultural and film workers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army at the first reception, applause and cheers resounded for a long time, and the enthusiastic atmosphere made people forget who were the hosts and who were the guests. The army film worker Yu Ji delivered a welcome speech, saying: Soviet films, including "Unforgettable Year 1919" which we are showing tonight, have given our soldiers tremendous encouragement. Today, we want to thank our Soviet film comrades in person. The delegation accepted flowers amidst warm applause. Then, Chirkov, a member of the Soviet film artists delegation, Stalin Prize winner, representative of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, and the leading actor in famous films such as "Donbass Miners," was invited to speak. He said: We have brought respect for you from Moscow.

The second reception was held at Tsinghua University in the western suburbs. Groups of students lined the road from the school gate to welcome Fedorov, the head of the Soviet film artists delegation, and others. They held hundreds of red lanterns high in their hands, illuminating the avenue leading to the venue. Because the Soviet film "We Stand for Peace" was about to be screened at the reception attended by more than 5,000 people, the chief cinematographer of this film, Pavlov, a member of the Soviet film artists delegation, Honored Artist of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, and Stalin Prize winner, was invited to speak at the meeting. Pavlov said: "The Soviet people sincerely love the heroic Chinese people. At the Moscow Film Studio where I work, all the staff, like all the Soviet people, ask us to extend our sincere greetings to the great Chinese people." Pavlov said: "As a filmmaker, we are immensely rewarded when we know that our films have helped in your work and struggle." Ladynina, a member of the delegation, People's Artist of the Soviet Union, Stalin Prize winner, and the leading actress in the Soviet film "A Happy Life," was also invited to speak. She said, "I will always remember the warm welcome you gave us here today." She excitedly held the silver microphone and sang a song from "A Happy Life."

When the delegation arrived at Beijing Normal University, the students waved colorful silk scarves and bunches of flowers to welcome the delegation into the reception venue. The Soviet film "The Village Teacher" had just been shown at the joyful evening party. Smirnova, the author of the screenplay for this film, a member of the delegation, and Stalin Prize winner, said in her speech to everyone: "We are very excited by the welcoming mood that is surging like a tide. We feel very honored to be able to come to the city where Comrade Mao Zedong works and lives." She said: "Dear friends, may you live a more beautiful life, because you have a reliable friend, and that is the Soviet Union." Petrov, a member of the delegation, also spoke at the meeting. He said: "The great Stalin taught us, the youth, to love labor and love life."

That evening, everyone who attended the reception left with unforgettable memories of the great friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people.

Xinhua News Agency, 10th: Fedorov, the head of the Soviet film artists delegation, and members Ladynina, Chirkov, Petrov, Smirnova, and Pavlov, accompanied by Chinese film workers Wang Yang, Li Jingwen, and Wang Songsheng, deputy director of the Cultural Affairs Administration of the Beijing Municipal People's Government, visited the Youth Palace, Dahua, and Capital Cinemas on the 10th, and met with Beijing movie audiences for the first time.

Beijing movie audiences have been constantly and deeply educated by Soviet films, and they were very excited to be able to see the representative figures of Soviet film workers in person. Today, unforgettable scenes appeared in these three cinemas. When Fedorov and others arrived and spoke, the audience repeatedly stood up and expressed their welcome to the Soviet friends with very warm and prolonged applause, and constantly shouted "Stalin-Mao Zedong!"

Chirkov, People's Artist of the Soviet Union, representative of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, the leading actor in "Donbass Miners," and the actor who played the district committee secretary in "Hero of the Golden Star," and Ladynina, People's Artist of the Soviet Union, and the leading actress in "Siberian Symphony" and "A Happy Life," conveyed the greetings of the Soviet people to the audience at the Youth Palace in enthusiastic words. At the request of the audience, Ladynina sang the famous interlude "You Were Like This Before, You Are Still Like This Now" from "A Happy Life" as a solo at the Youth Palace.

Petrov, the director of "The Battle of Stalingrad" and "The Innocent," spoke to the audience at the Dahua Cinema. Smirnova, the screenwriter of films such as "The Village Teacher," "The Village Doctor," and "A Real Man," and Pavlov, the cinematographer of "Siberian Symphony" and "A Happy Life," spoke to the audience at the Capital Cinema.

At the Dahua and Capital Cinemas, young pioneers from the audience presented flowers and red scarves to the members of the Soviet film artists delegation to pay their respects. Smirnova gave several young pioneers a signed photo of herself at the Dahua Cinema.

Xinhua News Agency, 11th: Fedorov, the head of the Soviet film artists delegation, and members Chirkov, Petrov, Smirnova, Pavlov, and others, visited the famous Beihai Park in the capital on the afternoon of the 11th. The representatives greatly appreciated the ancient monuments in the park. With great interest, they climbed to the highest point of the White Pagoda and had a panoramic view of the capital. Pavlov, the famous cinematographer who had filmed "Siberian Symphony," "A Happy Life," and other films, took many landscape photos in various parts of the park. The representatives also visited the anti-American and aid-Korea photo exhibition inside the Yilantang Hall. They all wrote words in the guestbook to express their great indignation at the aggressive crimes of American imperialism. Chirkov, representative of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, and People's Artist, and the famous director Petrov jointly wrote the following sentence: "Long live the heroic Chinese and Korean people!" In the park, a group of middle school students enthusiastically surrounded the representatives. When they learned that Chirkov was the leading actor in the "Maxim Trilogy" films, they jumped up happily and asked the representatives to sign their study notebooks as precious mementos.
