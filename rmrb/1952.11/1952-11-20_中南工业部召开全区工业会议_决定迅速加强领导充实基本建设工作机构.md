Xinhua News Agency Report: The Central South Military and Administrative Committee's Industrial Department convened a regional industrial conference in mid-October to examine the completion of basic construction tasks by state-owned and local state-owned enterprises. The results of the examination showed that this year's basic construction projects in the Central South region were following basic construction procedures, proceeding with construction after planning and design. However, progress was very slow. As of the end of September, only 41.84 percent of the total annual planned workload for basic construction projects in the entire region had been completed. The textile industry had completed a relatively high percentage, reaching 75.91 percent, while other industries such as non-ferrous metal coal mines, iron and steel smelting, electrical manufacturing, and the electric power industry had completed very poorly. In terms of project quality, there were also some shortcomings. For example, during the expansion of the Jiujiang Xingzhong Cotton Mill, due to inadequate design, the 26-meter-long reinforced concrete roof did not have expansion joints, resulting in three cracks.

The main reason for the lag in basic construction work was that many factory and mine leaders did not pay enough attention to leading basic construction. They generally emphasized production work, but were unfamiliar with or even neglected basic construction work. They did not do enough, or did not do at all, on how to carry out basic construction work, organize design and construction forces, and how to improve the basic construction organization. For example, the basic construction organization was not established or was not sound enough, and there was no one specifically responsible for leading this aspect. There was a lack of political education for employees and technical personnel in the basic construction department. There was no in-depth mobilization of basic construction workers to launch labor competitions, and advanced experience was not promoted among employees. As a result, the vast majority of construction workers still adhered to old habits and operated using old methods. For example, general bricklayers are still stagnating at the backward level of laying only five or six hundred bricks per day. In the past, the leading departments did not closely monitor and supervise basic construction projects, and the approval of plans and allocation of funds to lower levels were relatively slow, which affected the progress of factory and mine basic construction projects.

After reviewing these shortcomings, the conference decided to vigorously strengthen basic construction work in the fourth quarter and strive to complete 85 percent of the total annual planned workload by the end of the year. In order to achieve this goal, the Central South Industrial Department called on all factories and mines to do the following four things: (1) Factory directors and managers should have someone specifically in charge of leading basic construction projects. (2) Political work in the basic construction department should be strengthened; construction plans should be submitted to the masses of employees for discussion, and labor competitions should be launched based on the plans. (3) Vigorous efforts should be made to promote various advanced working methods and overcome conservative ideas among workers. (4) Other departments should be mobilized to serve basic construction, such as the materials department to ensure timely supply of materials and avoid work stoppages due to waiting for materials.

### 中南工业部召开全区工业会议  决定迅速加强领导充实基本建设工作机构

    中南工业部召开全区工业会议
    决定迅速加强领导充实基本建设工作机构
    【新华社讯】中南军政委员会工业部十月中旬召开全区工业会议，检查了所属国营和地方国营企业基本建设任务完成的情况。检查结果说明今年中南区的基本建设工程是按照基本建设程序，经过计划、设计然后施工的；但进度却十分缓慢。截至九月底止，全区基本建设工程只完成全年计划工作总量的百分之四十一点八四，完成得较多的只有纺织工业达百分之七十五点九一，其他如有色金属煤矿、钢铁冶炼工业、电器制造工业、电力工业等都完成的很差。在工程质量方面，也存在一些缺点，如九江兴中纱厂在扩充厂房时，因设计不周，长达二十六公尺的钢筋混凝土屋面未做伸缩缝，发生裂缝三条。
    造成基本建设工作落后的原因，主要是由于许多厂矿领导干部对基本建设的领导工作未加重视。他们一般的重视生产工作了，但对基本建设工作还很生疏甚至有些忽视。应该如何进行基本建设工作，组织设计施工力量，如何健全基本建设的机构等等，他们没有做或者做得很不够。如基本建设的组织机构没有建立或不够健全，也没有专人负责这一方面的领导。对于基本建设部门的职工和技术人员缺乏政治教育，没有深入发动基本建设工人展开劳动竞赛，没有在职工中推广先进经验，因而绝大多数建筑工人仍然墨守成规，用旧法操作。如一般砌砖工人至今还停滞在每日砌砖五、六百块的落后水平。领导部门过去对基本建设工程的检查督促也抓得不紧，批准下面的计划和拨款都比较迟缓，影响了厂矿基本建设工程的进展。
    会议在检讨了这些缺点后，决定在第四季度大力加强基本建设工作，争取到年底完成全年计划工作总量的百分之八十五。为了达到这一目标，中南工业部号召各厂矿做好下列四件工作：（一）厂长、经理中要有专人领导基本建设工程。（二）要加强基本建设部门的政治工作；要把施工计划交给职工群众讨论，根据计划展开劳动竞赛。（三）大力推广各种先进工作方法，克服工人中的保守思想。（四）发动其他各种部门为基本建设服务，如材料部门要保证材料供应及时，不发生停工待料现象。
