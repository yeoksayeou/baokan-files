    Puyang and Liaocheng Special District Cooperatives
    Should Emphasize Coal Delivery to Rural Areas
    To the Editor: During my recent inspection of work in Puyang and Liaocheng Special Districts of Pingyuan Province, I discovered many problems in the coal delivery to rural areas. Local leading authorities have not given enough attention to this important work.
    Transportation in these two districts is inconvenient, and the masses are not accustomed to burning coal. However, local fuel is insufficient, and many people often steam one batch of buns and eat them for three days. In some areas, they even cut down living trees for fuel. Since 1950, the state-owned Coal Construction Company has been selling coal in the area, but due to high transportation costs and coal prices, farmers cannot afford to buy it, and the fuel problem remains unresolved. This year, after the coal business was transferred to the cooperatives, the Coal Construction Company reduced coal prices, but the coal sales target still could not be met. In Puyang Special District, coal sales in July and August only accounted for 15% of the second half of the year's sales plan; in Liaocheng Special District, coal sales in the third quarter only accounted for 39.22% of the original plan, far behind the actual needs of the masses.
    Why can't the coal sales plan be completed? The main reason is that the leading cadres of some county cooperatives do not pay enough attention to this work, and the assigned cadres are few and weak. These cadres can hardly cope with daily business, let alone conduct propaganda to the farmers. Secondly, some leading cadres of county cooperatives have conservative ideas, do not understand the actual situation of the masses, and blindly believe that coal cannot be sold.
    Of course, there are other reasons, which will not be listed here. I hope that the relevant authorities will immediately inspect the work of coal delivery to rural areas, promptly correct shortcomings, and solve the fuel problem of the farmers.

### 濮阳、聊城专区合作社  应该重视煤炭下乡工作

    濮阳、聊城专区合作社
    应该重视煤炭下乡工作
    编辑同志：我这次到平原省濮阳、聊城专区检查工作，发现这两个地区的煤炭下乡工作中，存在很多问题。当地领导机关对于这样重要的工作还没有给予足够的重视。
    这两个地区交通不便，群众没有烧煤的习惯。但当地燃料不足，许多群众常常蒸一顿馍吃三天。有的地区甚至砍伐活树作燃料。从一九五○年起，国营煤建公司就在该地区卖煤，但因运费太大，煤价较高，农民无力购买，还是不能解决燃料问题。今年煤炭业务改由合作社经营后，煤建公司又减低了煤价，但销煤任务还不能完成。濮阳专区七、八两个月中销煤量仅占下半年销煤计划的百分之十五；聊城专区第三季度销煤量仅占原计划百分之三九点二二。远远落后于群众的实际需要。
    为什么不能完成销煤计划呢？主要是部分县社的领导干部不重视这一工作，配备的干部又少又弱。这些干部连日常业务都很难应付，那里能向农民进行宣传呢？其次是部分县社领导干部有保守思想，不了解群众的实际情况，盲目地认为煤炭销不掉。
    当然还有其他原因，这里不一一列举了。希望有关机关立即检查煤炭下乡工作，及时纠正缺点，解决农民燃料问题。
