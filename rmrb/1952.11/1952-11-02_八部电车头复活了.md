    Eight Electric Locomotive Heads Revived
    Editor,

    Song Yuan, a model worker at the Pingxiang Mining Bureau's locomotive factory, immersed himself in hard work and overcame difficulties to repair eight electric locomotive heads that had been abandoned for more than ten years. He is continuing to repair two more. Song Yuan's achievement not only solved the difficulty of mechanical equipment but also saved the country forty billion yuan in wealth by increased production.

    There were many difficulties in repairing these abandoned electric locomotive heads. One electric locomotive head has two or three thousand parts. These electric locomotive heads, which had been disassembled into a chaotic and dilapidated state, often only had a broken shell left, and many parts were lost or damaged. The Pingxiang mine also did not have the technical personnel and skilled workers to repair electric locomotive heads, so the technical difficulties were very difficult to solve. But Song Yuan persevered and overcame various difficulties. In the assembly workshop, he used four pillars to prop up the frame beam and lift the car body, overcoming the difficulty of not having a repair pit. Many parts could not be found, and there were no drawings, so he explored and made them himself, trying again and again. He was missing an axle tile cover, and he went to the scrap iron pile several times to look for it, finally finding one. Thanks to his efforts, he finally assembled all eight electric locomotive heads and repaired them one by one.

    We should learn from Song Yuan's spirit of hard work and selfless work.

    八部电车头复活了
    编辑同志：萍乡矿务局机车厂劳动模范宋园，埋头苦干，克服困难，修复了废弃了十多年的八部电车头，还有两部正在继续修复。宋园的成就，不但解决了机械设备的困难，并且为国家增产节约四十亿元的财富。
    修复这些废弃了的电车头，是有很多困难的。一个电车头，就有二、三千种零件。而这些拆卸得七零八乱、残破不堪的电车头常常只剩下一个残破的外壳，许多零件都丢掉或坏掉了。萍乡矿又没有修理电车头的技术人员和技术工人，技术上的困难很难解决。但宋园始终坚持不懈，克服了各种困难。他在装配车间用四根柱子顶住房架横梁，吊起车身，克服了没有修车沟的困难。许多零件找不到了，又没有图样，他便摸索着配制，一次又一次地试作。缺了一个轴瓦盖子，他好几次到废铁堆里去翻，终于找到了一个。由于他的努力，终于配齐了八部电车头，一部一部地把它们修复起来。
    我们应该学习宋园的这种刻苦的忘我的工作精神。    梁曼云
