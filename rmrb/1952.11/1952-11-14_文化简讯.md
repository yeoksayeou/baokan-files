The Chinese Translation of Tikhonov's New Work "Stories of Pakistan" Has Been Published

Recently, Times Publishing House published "Stories of Pakistan" by the famous poet, essayist, and head of the Soviet cultural delegation that visited China, Nikolai Tikhonov. This book is a sketch made by the author during his visit to Pakistan in 1949. From the author's concise, vivid, and beautiful prose, we can see that in Pakistan, a country with a mild climate and abundant agricultural products, the lives of the working people are extremely miserable due to the brutal exploitation and oppression of American and British imperialism. However, as the author reported, in Pakistan, the power of the people has grown significantly, and the mass movement to defend peace has also unfolded.

Tikhonov's works that have been translated into Chinese and published in our country include "Soviet People Portraits" and "Kirov Is With Us" (both published by Times Publishing House). Currently, People's Literature Publishing House and Times Publishing House are translating his works, and "Tikhonov's Poetry Collection" and "Stories of Leningrad" will be published soon.

The Fifth Issue of "Russian Language Teaching" is About to Be Published

The fifth issue of "Russian Language Teaching" will be published on the 15th. This issue features an editorial entitled "Improve Russian Language Teaching and Strive to Rapidly and Massively Train Russian Language Talents." The editorial summarizes the achievements of Russian language teaching work across the country in the past three years and points out the central tasks for the future. In addition, this issue also introduces the experience of Tsinghua University and other schools in piloting accelerated reading methods for Russian professional books (including teaching experience and compilation of teaching materials), as well as the learning experiences and self-study methods of professors. In addition, this issue has special articles on foreign language teaching methods, the organization and work of teaching research offices, and continues to publish lectures on grammar, phonetics, vocabulary, and translation. Minister of Education Ma Xulun and Vice Ministers Qian Junrui and Zeng Zhaolun have all written articles for this issue.
