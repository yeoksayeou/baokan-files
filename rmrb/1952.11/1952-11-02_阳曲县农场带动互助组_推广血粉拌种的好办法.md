    Yangqu County Farm Leads Mutual Aid Teams to Promote the Good Method of Seed Dressing with Blood Meal

    To the Editor: Our Yangqu County Farm has successfully experimented with seed dressing using blood meal.

    For the past two or three years, the amount of fertilizer applied by farmers in our county has increased, generally reaching about 3,000 jin per mu. However, the quality of the fertilizer is very poor. This spring, our farm and the small farms of various villages jointly used the advanced experience of the Northeast Agricultural Experiment Station in using blood meal to increase yield, and have already achieved preliminary results. The most significant effect was seen in our farm and the small farm of Zheng Guangguo's mutual aid team. The experimental method was to plant two mu of millet on land of the same quality, using the same quality and quantity of fertilizer. Before sowing, one mu of millet seed was mixed with four liang of pig blood meal, and the other mu was left unmixed as a control area. As a result, the blood meal-treated area had better root development, was more drought-resistant, the millet seedlings were stronger, the leaves were dark green, and the stalks were firm, taller than the untreated plants by more than three cun, and the ears were thick and large. It is estimated that the yield can be increased by 10 to 20 percent. Passersby on the road, passing by the small farm of Zheng Guangguo's mutual aid team, were attracted by the two different crops growing on the same piece of land, and everyone earnestly inquired about the reasons. After the explanation, some people regretted saying: If I had known that blood meal had such a great effect, I would not have thrown away the pig blood in the past! This is no small loss!

    Why does seed dressing with blood meal have such a great effect? Because blood meal contains a large amount of nitrogen and phosphorus and a small amount of potassium, possessing the three essential fertilizer elements; nitrogen can make seedlings grow vigorously and stems and leaves flourish; phosphate fertilizer can help seeds germinate and young roots extend. Pulling up the seedling roots treated with blood meal for inspection, the fibrous roots are numerous and long, so they can adequately absorb underground water and nutrients, and thus are drought-resistant.

    Blood meal is also very easy to make. Any animal blood can be used to make blood meal. Fresh blood, after solidifying for half a day or a day, is dried on glass or iron sheets, ground into powder, and sieved through a fine mesh sieve, the finer the better. The blood from each pig can yield more than one jin of blood meal, which can be used to treat four mu of millet, sorghum, and corn, or one mu of wheat. When mixing the seeds, in order to get the blood meal to stick to the seeds, the seeds can be moistened with a wet towel. The typical blood meal seed dressing experiment has been widely taught through the technical dissemination station and is very popular. Some farmers feel that there is too little pig and sheep blood, and plan to hunt more mountain animals this winter to make blood meal, in preparation for use next year.

    阳曲县农场带动互助组
    推广血粉拌种的好办法
    编辑同志：我们阳曲县农场用血粉拌种试验成功了。
    两三年来，我县农民在田里施肥的数量已经提高了，每亩地一般达到三千斤左右。但肥料质量很差。今春我场和各村小农场联合试用东北农业试验场血粉拌种提高产量的先进经验，已经有了初步成果。成效最显著的是本场和郑光国互助组的小农场。试验方法是在同样质量的土地上，种谷二亩，施用同质同量的肥料，在下种前，用四两猪血粉，拌一亩谷种，另一亩未拌，作为对照区。结果，用血粉拌种的，根系发育得好，并能耐旱，谷苗健壮，叶色深绿，秸秆坚硬，高出未拌的植株三寸多，结穗粗大，预计可增产百分之十到二十。来往行人路过郑光国互助组的这个小农场，都被这一样地上长出的两样庄稼吸引住了，大家认真地询问道理。经讲解后，有的人后悔地说：早知道血粉有这么大的劲，过去那能把猪血都扔掉了呢！这个损失可不小！
    为什么血粉拌种能起这么大的作用呢？因为血粉里含有多量的氮、磷和少量钾，具备了肥料三要素；氮素能使幼苗生长健旺，茎叶繁茂；磷质肥料能帮助种子发芽，幼根伸张。拔起血粉拌种的苗根来检查，须根多而长，所以能够充足地吸收地下水分和养分，因而耐旱。
    血粉也很容易作。凡是动物的血，都能做血粉。鲜血经过半天或一天时间凝固以后，放在玻璃或铁片上晒干，研成粉末，用细眼箩筛过，越细越好。每个猪的血能出血粉一斤多，能拌谷子、高粱、玉茭四亩，麦子一亩。在拌种时为了把血粉沾到种子上，可把种子用湿手巾擦湿。血粉拌种典型试验通过技术传授站广泛地传授出去，很受欢迎。有的农民感到猪羊血少，计划今冬多打山兽制成血粉，准备明年用。    阳曲县农场副场长    刘稼生
