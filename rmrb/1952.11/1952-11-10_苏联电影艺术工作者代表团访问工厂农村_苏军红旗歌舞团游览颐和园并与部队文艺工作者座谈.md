    Members of the delegation, Comrade Cherkasov, Soviet People's Actor, Deputy of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, Stalin Prize winner, and the lead in famous films such as "Donbass Miners," Comrade Petrov, Soviet People's Actor, Stalin Prize winner, and director of films such as "The Battle of Stalingrad," and Comrade Pavlov, Honored Art Worker of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, Stalin Prize winner, and cinematographer of films such as "A Happy Life," visited the Mentougou coal mining area in western Beijing and met with the worker masses there.
    The workers and peasants were very happy about the arrival of the Soviet friends. These friends, who they had already met in the movies, were now shaking hands and talking with them. Liu Yingyuan, the director of the Shijingshan Power Plant and a national model worker, excitedly shook hands with Fedorov, Ladinina, and Smirnova, and told them, "'A Happy Life' and many other Soviet films have inspired our production enthusiasm and strengthened our confidence in striving for the arrival of socialism." Yang Guilin, a worker from the Chengzi Coal Mine in Mentougou, western Beijing, and a Beijing municipal industrial model worker, shook hands tightly with Cherkasov as if he were an old friend of many years, because "Donbass Miners" gave him strength, making him understand how to fight against conservative ideas with an attitude of responsibility to the people, and to accelerate the process of the motherland's construction by stepping up the study and promotion of advanced Soviet production experience. Zeng Zhaozhou, the village head of Yamenkou Village, said, "Soviet peasants are the happiest peasants in the world and are our best example. The Soviet Union's today is our tomorrow."
    Wherever the Soviet friends went, they were warmly welcomed. The workers of the Shijingshan Power Plant stated that in order to celebrate the great October Socialist Revolution Day and thank the Soviet friends for their visit, they have decided to increase production and save the equivalent of 5 billion yuan in wealth for the country in the last two months of this year.
    After bidding farewell to the Soviet friends, Yamenkou Village, Shijingshan Power Plant, and Mentougou Coal Mine respectively screened the colorful films "A Bright Summer," "Gold Star Hero," and "Donbass Miners."

    [Another dispatch] The Soviet Army Red Flag Song and Dance Ensemble visited the Summer Palace, a famous scenic spot in Beijing, from 10:00 AM to 4:30 PM on the 8th.
    In front of the Hall of Dispelling Clouds, the Soviet friends encountered soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and a group of innocent and lively children who were visiting the park together, and they were warmly welcomed.
