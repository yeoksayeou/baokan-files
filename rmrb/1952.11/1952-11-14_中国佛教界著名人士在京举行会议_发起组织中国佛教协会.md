Xinhua News Agency, November 13th: Prominent living Buddhas, Dharma masters, and lay Buddhists from Chinese Buddhist circles: Xu Yun, Xiraojiacuo, Gela Cang (Grand Living Buddha of Ganzhou Temple, Inner Mongolia), Yuan Ying, Liu Xia·Tudeng Tabai (Head of the Tibetan Tribute Delegation), Danba Rije (Grand Khenpo of Tashilhunpo Monastery, Tibet), Luosang Basang (Zasake Lama of Mount Wutai), Duojizhandong (Grand Zhuoni of Sakya Monastery, Tibet), Neng Hai, Fazun, Juzan, Chen Mingshu, Lü Cheng, Zhao Puchu, Dong Luan, Ye Gongchuo, Lin Zaiping, Xiang Da, Zhou Shujia, Guo Peng, and others, recently initiated the establishment of the Buddhist Association of China in Beijing and held a sponsors' meeting on the 4th and 5th. The participating sponsors included members of the Tibetan, Mongolian, Han, and Miao ethnic groups, and came from Tibet, Inner Mongolia, the Northwest, Southwest, Central South, North China, and East China.

Prior to the meeting, Li Weihan, Minister of the United Front Work Department of the CPC Central Committee, received the sponsors and explained the Common Program and the Central People's Government's policy of freedom of religious belief, and expressed his support for the establishment of the Buddhist Association of China. He said: Over the past three years, all the great people's movements across the country have achieved brilliant successes. Buddhist figures in various regions have also participated in the movements, and the distinction between the enemy and ourselves has been initially drawn in the Buddhist community. This is a very good phenomenon. At the time of the initiation of the Buddhist Association of China, it is hoped that patriotic Buddhists will unite, continue to distinguish between the enemy and ourselves, form a solid united front with the people of the whole country, assist the People's Government in implementing the policy of freedom of religious belief, and strive to build the motherland and defend world peace. During the discussion, the speakers all expressed their agreement with Minister Li Weihan's remarks.

During the meeting, Li Jishen, Vice Chairman of the Central People's Government, was invited to attend for guidance. Zhao Fan, member of the Ethnic Affairs Commission of the Central People's Government, and He Chengxiang, Director of the Religious Affairs Department of the Cultural and Educational Committee of the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government, were also invited to attend.

The meeting was presided over by Master Xiraojiacuo and Lay Buddhist Zhao Puchu. In his address, Lay Buddhist Zhao Puchu said: The liberation of the Chinese people has given Chinese Buddhists the opportunity to cleanse away filth and see the light again. Thanks to the victory of the great reform movements carried out by the people of the motherland in the past three years, our Buddhists have distinguished between good and evil and maintained the purity of religion; thanks to the great movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, our Buddhists have had a good opportunity to defend the country and protect all living beings. The ethnic and religious policies in the Common Program enable us to unite together and work together in the big family of ethnic friendship and harmony. At the same time, our freedom of religious belief is also guaranteed. These are all the results of the correct leadership of our great leader Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government. Therefore, today we have this opportunity to initiate the establishment of the organization of the Buddhist Association of China.

The sponsors exchanged enthusiastic and extensive opinions on the establishment of the Buddhist Association of China in their speeches. Master Xiraojiacuo said: It is a great joy for Buddhists across the country that we are initiating the establishment of the Buddhist Association of China. We wholeheartedly support the People's Government's policy of freedom of religious belief. In the future, we must further strengthen the connection between Buddhists in the border areas and the interior, so that Buddhists across the country can further unite in the movement to build the motherland and defend peace. Liu Xia·Tudeng Tabai said: We are grateful to Chairman Mao for his concern and love for the Tibetan people, which has enabled us to get rid of the shackles and oppression of imperialism. Tibet is a sacred place of Chinese Buddhism, and the vast majority of the people believe in Buddhism. After we return to Tibet, we must convey the resolutions of this meeting to the three major monasteries in Lhasa. The sponsors also studied and discussed in detail the purpose, tasks, and organization of the establishment of the Buddhist Association of China. Everyone unanimously agreed that the purpose of establishing the Buddhist Association of China is: to unite Buddhists across the country under the leadership of the People's Government to participate in the movement to love the motherland and defend world peace, to assist the People's Government in implementing the policy of freedom of religious belief, and to liaise with Buddhists in various regions to jointly promote the cause of benefiting all living beings by propagating Buddhist teachings. The meeting finally adopted the "Initiation Letter of the Buddhist Association of China" and unanimously elected Zhao Puchu, Liu Xia·Tudeng Tabai, Danba Rije, Juzan, Zhou Shujia, Guo Peng, and Li Yiping to organize a preparatory office, and invited He Chengxiang and Zhao Fan to participate. Zhao Puchu was appointed as the director of the preparatory office on the spot.
