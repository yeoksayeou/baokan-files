Xinhua News Agency, Prague, November 23rd, TASS dispatch: The Czechoslovak News Agency broadcast the indictment regarding the anti-state conspiracy center case headed by Rudolf Slánský.

The indictment brings charges against the following individuals: former General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, Rudolf Slánský; former Director of the International Department of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, Bedřich Geminder; former Head of the Economic Department of the Office of the President of the Republic, Ludvík Frejka; former Deputy General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, Josef Frank; former Minister of Foreign Affairs, Vladimír Clementis; former Deputy Minister of National Defense, Bedřich Reicin; former Deputy Minister of National Security, Karel Šváb; former Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, Artur London; former Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, Vavro Hajdů; former Deputy Minister of Foreign Trade, Evžen Löbl; former Deputy Minister of Foreign Trade, Rudolf Margolius; former Deputy Minister of Finance, Otto Fischl; former Secretary of the Brno Regional Committee of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, Otto Šling; former editor of "Red Right News," Andrej Simone.

The indictment states: These individuals are all “traitors of the Trotskyist-Titoist, ‘Zionist,’ and bourgeois nationalist types, and are enemies of the Czechoslovak people, the people's democratic system, and socialism; they serve American imperialists and, under the direction of Western espionage agencies, organized an anti-state conspiracy center, plotting to subvert the people's democratic system, undermine socialist construction, damage the national economy, engage in espionage, weaken the unity of the Czechoslovak people and the defense capabilities of the republic, using these methods to make the republic abandon its close alliance and friendly relations with the Soviet Union, eliminate Czechoslovakia's people's democratic system, restore capitalism, pull the republic back into the imperialist camp, and destroy its national sovereignty and independence.”

The indictment states: Since the liberation of Czechoslovakia by the Soviet army in 1945, the main representatives of imperialist spies within Czechoslovakia have been a group of traitors who betrayed the Czechoslovak people, headed by veteran Western agents Eduard Beneš, Petr Zenkl, Hubert Ripka, Bohumil Laušman, Jan Stránský, and Josef Lettrich.

In addition to this open group, the imperialists organized another group of traitors within the Communist Party who betrayed the working class. The imperialists recognized the strength of the Communist Party and deployed this group long before the Munich Agreement during the Republic period. Furthermore, because they attached particular importance to their post-war plans, they strengthened this group on the eve of World War II.

It is clear from the indictment that imperialist espionage agencies recruited Evžen Löbl, Otto Šling, Ludvík Frejka, Vavro Hajdů, Andrej Simone, and other Trotskyites, "Zionists," and similar traitors who betrayed the Czechoslovak people into the Communist Party to conduct hostile activities against the Czechoslovak people.

The American imperialists dispatched Slánský, who has now been revealed to be a veteran bourgeois agent and a despicable traitor to the Czechoslovak people, to serve as the leader of this gang of criminals, whose aim was to undermine the Czechoslovak People's Democratic Republic in the event of Beneš's failure.

The imperialists' choice of Slánský was not accidental. Slánský came from a family of big businessmen and wormed his way into the Communist Party. He outwardly put on a communist demeanor, but in his heart, he remained a loyal servant of the bourgeoisie his entire life.

According to Slánský's confession, he embarked on the path of Trotskyism in 1927 and has always been an opportunist.

Slánský acted as an agent for the American espionage agency in the early 1930s and worked with Hering-Greenville, a major American spy and representative of international "Zionism."

During the war, Slánský established a relationship with General Pika, a well-known agent of American and British imperialists, for espionage purposes.

Slánský arrived in Slovakia in the early days of the Slovak Uprising in 1944, where he carried out the imperialists' plan to re-enslave Slovakia and continued to betray the interests of the Czechoslovak people.

After the Soviet army liberated Czechoslovakia, Slánský, who had usurped the position of General Secretary of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, began to actively place enemies of the Czechoslovak people, trained by American spies Dulles and Field, in important positions within the party and state organs.

Ludvík Frejka, Otto Šling, Evžen Löbl, Andrej Simone, Vavro Hajdů, Artur London, and others arrived in Czechoslovakia one after another.

Rudolf Slánský, using his position as General Secretary of the party and cunningly concealing his hostile plans, deliberately gathered around him fascists, war criminals, and various adventurers who concealed their true nature from the party, such as Josef Frank, Karel Šváb, Bedřich Reicin, and Otto Fischl, gradually forming an anti-republic conspiracy center.

The indictment continues: Before February 1948, when the open group led by Beneš was still legitimate, Slánský directed the anti-state center he was then organizing to support the Beneš group.

The indictment states: After Czechoslovakia suppressed the counter-revolutionary coup and expelled the reactionary parties in February 1948, American imperialists assigned their Czechoslovak servants, led by Slánský, the task of overthrowing the People's Democratic Republic by carrying out counter-revolutionary conspiracies within the Communist Party and physically eliminating the leader of the Czechoslovak people, Gottwald.

The indictment states: Slánský gradually selected the people most loyal to him from among those who had fled to the West, "Zionists," Trotskyites, bourgeois nationalists, spies, and other enemies of the Czechoslovak people, and placed them in important positions within the party and state organs. When placing these people, he concealed their ambiguous histories from the responsible leaders, fabricated stories, praised their qualities, and remained silent about and shielded their despicable activities.

These rebellious elements engaged in various subversive activities, mainly espionage.

American and British espionage agencies also used some seasoned spies—their ambassadors, military attachés, journalists, cultural representatives, and commercial representatives, etc.—to plot conspiracies and collect intelligence in the Czechoslovak Republic.

These rebellious elements established espionage relations with American Ambassador Steinhardt.

American journalists Maurice Hindus and David Schoenbrun also actively engaged in espionage activities in Czechoslovakia under the cover of their press credentials. Andrej Simone worked with them on espionage.

These rebellious elements also had extensive contacts with British espionage agencies. Among the British spies who maintained contact with these rebellious elements, the indictment mentions former British Ambassadors to Czechoslovakia Nichols and Dixon, Gladwyn Jebb, the notorious Zilliacus, and journalists Lias, Alexander Werth, and Paul Willert.

The rebellious elements also had contact with French espionage agencies, especially with French Ambassador Dejean.

Under the leadership of Slánský, the rebellious elements carried out the orders given to them by their overseas masters, using every possible means to obstruct Czechoslovakia's socialist construction.

When drafting and implementing the Five-Year Plan, the rebellious elements led by Slánský used all possible means of sabotage to hinder the party and the people's efforts to build socialism in the Czechoslovak Republic. Economic planning work was disrupted.

The indictment continues: The rebellious elements hated the people and socialism and served the imperialists. They used every means to secretly undermine the socialist transformation of agriculture in Czechoslovakia.

These rebellious elements were fanatical enemies of the Soviet Union, socialism, and the people. They undermined economic relations with the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, using every means to harm these economic relations.

It is clear from the indictment that Slánský and his accomplices heinously deceived the government and party organizations, as well as the Czechoslovak people, and did everything possible to help and encourage domestic and exiled capitalists and rich peasants, giving them favorable conditions to carry out subversive activities against the people's democratic Czechoslovak Republic.

The indictment points out that the anti-state conspiracy center headed by Slánský was able to carry out subversive activities for a considerable period of time because it had managed to usurp leadership positions in the public security organs.

The indictment states: Slánský, Geminder, and other rebellious elements particularly supported and encouraged the subversive activities of "Zionists" (reliable agents of American imperialism).

The indictment states: The investigation shows that Slánský took active measures to shorten the life of the President of the Republic, Gottwald. With this aim, he selected doctors for the President from hostile groups with ambiguous past histories, maintained close contact with them, and hoped to use them to promote his own hostile plans.

American imperialists also colluded with the Tito fascist group to plot a counter-revolutionary coup in Czechoslovakia.

The indictment points out that when the rebellious elements were exposed, and most of them were already in prison, American imperialist elements saw that the ringleader of the conspiracy, Slánský, was in danger of being arrested. Therefore, as confirmed by the investigation results, they attempted to find a way for Slánský to escape from the Czechoslovak Republic through their espionage agency in Frankfurt am Main.

The indictment points out: Therefore, it has been irrefutably proven that the defendants in this case, headed by Slánský, have committed serious anti-state and anti-people crimes.

    关于以鲁道夫·斯兰斯基为首的反国家阴谋中心案的起诉书（摘要）
    【新华社二十三日讯】塔斯社布拉格二十一日讯：捷克斯洛伐克通讯社广播关于以鲁道夫·斯兰斯基为首的反国家阴谋中心案的起诉书。
    起诉书对下面这些人提出诉讼：前捷克斯洛伐克共产党中央委员会总书记鲁道夫·斯兰斯基；前捷克斯洛伐克共产党中央委员会书记处国际部主任贝德里赫·盖明德尔；前共和国总统办公厅经济处处长卢德维克·佛雷伊卡；前捷克斯洛伐克共产党中央委员会副总书记约瑟夫·弗兰克；前外交部部长乌拉季米尔·克利门蒂斯；前国防部副部长贝德里赫·雷伊辛；前国家保安部副部长卡列尔·斯瓦勃；前外交部副部长阿图尔·隆登；前外交部副部长瓦夫罗·哈伊杜；前对外贸易部副部长伊夫仁·洛布尔；前对外贸易部副部长鲁道夫·玛尔果利乌斯；前财政部副部长奥托·费希尔；前捷克斯洛伐克共产党布尔诺州委员会书记奥托·斯林；前“红色权利报”编辑安德烈·西蒙。
    起诉书说：这些人都是“托洛茨基—铁托、‘犹太复国主义’和资产阶级民族主义等类的叛徒，同时是捷克斯洛伐克人民、人民民主制度和社会主义的敌人；他们为美帝国主义者服务并且在西方间谍机关的指使下，组织了一个反国家的阴谋中心，阴谋颠覆人民民主制度，破坏社会主义建设，损害国民经济，进行间谍活动，削弱捷克斯洛伐克人民的团结和共和国的国防能力，用这些来使共和国背弃它对苏联的亲密同盟和友好关系，消灭捷克斯洛伐克的人民民主制度，恢复资本主义，把共和国重新拉进帝国主义阵营并且破坏它的国家主权与独立”。
    起诉书说：自从一九四五年苏军解放了捷克斯洛伐克以后，捷克斯洛伐克境内帝国主义间谍的主要代表，是以西方的老牌特务爱德华·贝奈斯、彼得·赞克尔、赫伯特·李普卡、波古米尔·劳斯曼、詹·斯拉美克和约瑟夫·莱特立区为首的出卖捷克斯洛伐克人民的叛徒集团。
    除了这个公开的集团之外，帝国主义者又在共产党内部组织了另一个背叛工人阶级的叛徒集团。帝国主义者觉察到共产党的力量，远在慕尼黑事件以前的共和国时期，就布置了这个集团，同时因为特别重视他们战后的计划，更在第二次世界大战前夕将这个集团加强起来。
    从起诉书中可以明显看出，帝国主义间谍机关拉拢混进共产党的伊夫仁·洛布尔、奥托·斯林、卢德维克·佛雷伊卡、瓦夫罗·哈伊杜、安德烈·西蒙以及其他托洛茨基分子、“犹太复国主义”者和同类的背叛捷克斯洛伐克人民的叛徒们，对捷克斯洛伐克人民进行敌对的活动。
    美帝国主义者派遣现已被揭露是资产阶级的老牌特务、捷克斯洛伐克人民的卑鄙叛徒的斯兰斯基，充当这帮罪犯的首领，这帮罪犯的目的就是要在贝奈斯一旦失败之后来破坏捷克斯洛伐克人民民主共和国。
    帝国主义者看中斯兰斯基并不是偶然的。斯兰斯基出身于一个大商人的家庭，钻进了共产党。他在表面上做出一副共产党员的姿态，但在心里却终生是一个资产阶级忠顺的奴仆。
    据斯兰斯基供认，他在一九二七年就走上了托洛茨基主义的道路并且一直是一个机会主义者。
    斯兰斯基在三十年代初就充当了美国间谍机关的特务，并且和美国的一个大间谍及国际“犹太复国主义”代表海林格—格棱维尔一道工作。
    战争期间，斯兰斯基为了间谍工作的目的，跟美英帝国主义者的著名特务皮卡将军建立了关系。
    斯兰斯基于一九四四年斯洛伐克起义初期到了斯洛伐克，他执行帝国主义者重新奴役斯洛伐克的计划，继续出卖捷克斯洛伐克人民的利益。
    在苏军解放了捷克斯洛伐克以后，已窃据捷克斯洛伐克共产党总书记职位的斯兰斯基，开始积极地把美国间谍杜勒斯和费尔德一手训练出来的捷克斯洛伐克人民公敌安插到党和国家机构的重要岗位上去。
    卢德维克·佛雷伊卡、奥托·斯林、伊夫仁·洛布尔、安德烈·西蒙、瓦夫罗·哈伊杜、阿图尔·隆登等人纷纷来到了捷克斯洛伐克。
    鲁道夫·斯兰斯基利用他的党的总书记的地位并且狡猾地隐瞒他的敌对计划，蓄意把那些对党隐瞒真正本质的法西斯分子、战争罪犯和各种冒险家，如约瑟夫·弗兰克、卡列尔·斯瓦勃、贝德里赫·雷伊辛、奥托·费希尔之流，聚集在他的周围，逐渐形成了一个反对共和国的阴谋中心。
    起诉书接着说：在一九四八年二月以前，当帝国主义者以贝奈斯为首的公开集团还取得合法地位的时候，斯兰斯基就曾指挥他当时正在组织的反国家中心，支持贝奈斯集团。
    起诉书说：在一九四八年二月捷克斯洛伐克镇压了反革命政变和逐出反动政党以后，美帝国主义者给他们的以斯兰斯基为首的捷克斯洛伐克仆从们规定了一项任务，就是用在共产党内部进行反革命阴谋和在肉体上消灭捷克斯洛伐克人民领袖哥特瓦尔德的方法来推翻人民民主共和国。
    起诉书说：斯兰斯基逐渐从那些曾经逃亡到西方去的人、“犹太复国主义”者，托洛茨基分子、资产阶级民族主义者、间谍和其他捷克斯洛伐克人民公敌中间，挑出对他最忠顺的人，安插到党和国家机构的重要岗位上去。他在安插这些人的时候，同时把他所知道的这些人的暧昧历史瞒住负责的领导者，进行种种捏造，吹嘘他们的品质，对他们卑鄙的活动默不作声并且加以掩护。
    这些谋叛分子进行各种各样颠覆性的活动，主要是进行间谍活动。
    美英间谍机关还用了一些老练的间谍——它们的大使、武官、新闻记者、文化代表与商务代表等等，在捷克斯洛伐克共和国布置阴谋和搜集谍报。
    这些谋叛分子跟美国大使斯坦哈特建立了间谍关系。
    美国新闻记者毛里斯·辛杜斯和大卫·淑恩布隆用他们的记者证作掩护，也在捷克斯洛伐克积极从事间谍活动。安德烈·西蒙跟他们一道进行间谍工作。
    这些谋叛分子和英国的间谍机关也有广泛的联系。在与这些谋叛分子保持联系的英国间谍中，起诉书提到了前英国驻捷克斯洛伐克大使尼科尔斯和狄松，格拉德温·杰伯，恶名昭著的齐里亚库斯，新闻记者利亚斯、亚历山大·维尔茨和保罗·威勒特。
    谋叛分子和法国的间谍机关也有联系，尤其是和法国大使德让。
    谋叛分子在斯兰斯基领导之下执行他们海外主子所交下的命令，用一切可能的方法来阻挠捷克斯洛伐克的社会主义建设。
    在草拟和执行五年计划的时候，斯兰斯基所领导的谋叛分子用一切可能的破坏手段来阻碍党和人民在捷克斯洛伐克共和国建设社会主义的努力。经济的计划工作受到了破坏。
    起诉书继续说：谋叛分子仇恨人民和社会主义并且为帝国主义者服务，他们用尽一切方法来暗中破坏捷克斯洛伐克农业方面的社会主义改造工作。
    这些谋叛分子都是苏联、社会主义和人民的疯狂敌人，他们破坏对苏联和人民民主国家的经济关系，用尽一切方法来伤害这种经济关系。
    从起诉书中可以很明显地看出，斯兰斯基及其同谋犯，罪大恶极地欺骗政府和党的组织以及捷克斯洛伐克人民，千方百计地帮助并怂恿国内的和流亡在外的资本家和富农分子，使他们获得良好的条件来对人民民主主义的捷克斯洛伐克共和国进行颠覆活动。
    起诉书中指出：以斯兰斯基为首的反国家的阴谋中心之所以能够进行相当时间的颠覆性活动，是因为它曾侥幸僭据公安机关的领导职位。
    起诉书中说：斯兰斯基、盖明德尔及其他谋叛分子，特别支持并怂恿“犹太复国主义”者（美帝国主义的可靠的代理人）的颠覆性活动。
    起诉书说：调查结果说明，斯兰斯基曾采取积极措施以缩短共和国总统哥特瓦尔德的生命。他抱着这个目的，从过去历史暧昧的敌对集团中为总统挑选医师，跟他们保持密切联系，一心希望利用他们来推行他自己的敌对计划。
    美帝国主义者并拉拢铁托法西斯集团一同布置捷克斯洛伐克反革命政变。
    起诉书中指出：当谋叛分子被揭发，而且其中大多数已经下狱的时候，美帝国主义分子看出阴谋的头子斯兰斯基有被捕的危险。因此，据调查结果证实，他们曾企图通过他们设在美因河畔法兰克福的间谍机关，来设法使斯兰斯基逃出捷克斯洛伐克共和国。
    起诉书中指出：因此，已不容争论地证明了，以斯兰斯基为首的这个案子中的各个被告，已犯了反国家、反人民的重大罪行。
