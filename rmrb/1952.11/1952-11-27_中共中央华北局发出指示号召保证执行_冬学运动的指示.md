The instructions stated that in order to prevent the tendency of neglecting winter studies in various places, after the winter studies begin, the Party committees in various places should organize forces to conduct an inspection. As for the various contents of the current political education in winter studies, it should be well arranged in combination with the central work of the locality, so that the learning of the masses can be closely integrated with the current work.

    中共中央华北局发出指示号召保证执行“冬学运动的指示”
    中共中央华北局在十月三十日向所属各省、市党委及蒙绥分局发出指示，要求各级党委认真保证中央人民政府政务院华北行政委员会十月二十七日发出的“关于冬学运动的指示”的贯彻，防止只注意部分地区部分青壮年农民速成识字教育，而忽视广大农民冬季政治文化学习的偏向。指示说，为了使各地不致发生忽视冬学的偏向，冬学开始以后，各地党委应组织力量进行一次检查。至于冬学时事政治教育的各项内容，应结合当地中心工作很好安排，以便使群众的学习能与当前的工作紧密结合。
