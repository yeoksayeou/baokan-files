The Zhejiang Provincial People's Government and the Discipline Inspection Commission of the Zhejiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China recently investigated and dealt with three major cases in which some cadres in Ningbo City, Yuqian County, Xiaoshan County, and the Lin'an Special District seriously disregarded the interests of the people, lost their position, and violated human rights. The cadres who committed errors have been given punishments according to the severity of their circumstances; the lawbreakers have been arrested and brought to justice.

The first case is that of Ningbo City cigarette worker Feng Zhenyuan, who, in the struggle against the illegal activities of unscrupulous capitalist Mao Rongshou, suffered from the conspiracy and framing by the unscrupulous capitalist and the persecution of local government officials.

Feng Zhenyuan was an activist among the workers of the private Yuxing Cigarette Factory (formerly Yuchang Cigarette Factory) in Ningbo City. At the beginning of the liberation, he reported the criminal acts of unscrupulous capitalist Mao Rongshou in bribing the tax bureau's factory representative to evade taxes. In order to continue spreading "five poisons," Mao Rongshou conspired to frame Feng Zhenyuan and undermine the trade union. After many conspiracies were defeated by Feng Zhenyuan's counterattacks, Mao Rongshou, in June 1950, on the pretext of "off-season" and "production difficulties" (in fact, he himself had bribed the accountant to withdraw a large amount of funds in advance), wanted to dismiss 25 workers, including Feng Zhenyuan. Feng Zhenyuan saw through Mao Rongshou's new conspiracy, united the progressive workers in the factory, and argued with reason; he silenced Mao Rongshou with concrete facts and detailed accounting methods at the labor-capital consultation meetings three times.

However, Mao Rongshou still insisted on dismissing the workers, so the consultation was fruitless and the Labor Bureau had to handle it. The cadres of the Ningbo Municipal People's Government who were in charge of handling this case, led by Liu Defu, the Deputy Mayor and President of the Municipal People's Court and Director of the Municipal Labor Bureau, showed an extremely bad bureaucratic attitude. Liu Defu and Wang Shaoyun (Secretary of the Labor Bureau), who was actually in charge of the Ningbo Municipal Labor Bureau at the time, did not support Feng Zhenyuan's just struggle at all. They only blindly emphasized taking care of the capitalist's "production difficulties" based on the one-sided reports of certain cadres, and said that Feng Zhenyuan had "political problems," and agreed to exclude Feng Zhenyuan from the labor-capital consultation representatives. As a result, Feng Zhenyuan was dismissed by the "labor-capital consultation" manipulated by the unscrupulous capitalist Mao Rongshou. Feng Zhenyuan persisted in his struggle and wrote a letter to Liu Defu asking for support, but Liu ignored it and approved the "dismissal agreement." Feng Zhenyuan filed a complaint with the Ningbo Municipal People's Court. Cai Longfu, the vice chairman of the factory's trade union who was bought by the unscrupulous capitalist Mao Rongshou, took the Labor Bureau's letter of introduction to the court to "fight" against Feng Zhenyuan. Wei Jianyi, the vice president of the Ningbo Municipal People's Court, and others only relied on the Labor Bureau's opinion and ruled that the unscrupulous capitalist could dismiss Feng Zhenyuan. Feng Zhenyuan refused to accept the verdict and appealed to the Ningbo Branch of the Provincial People's Court, and firmly refused to leave the factory. At this time, the unscrupulous capitalist Mao Rongshou fabricated charges against Feng Zhenyuan such as "violating the agreement," "insulting the government," and "sabotaging production," and bribed Wang Zhengmin, a former judicial officer of the Ningbo Municipal People's Court, with 3 million yuan in "activity fees" to frame Feng Zhenyuan. On December 26, 1950, Feng Zhenyuan was unreasonably reprimanded by Feng Heqing, a judge of the Ningbo Branch of the Provincial People's Court. Mao Yinlian, the secretary of the court, had never even seen Feng Zhenyuan and wrote on the main text of the judgment: "Although Feng Zhenyuan comes from a worker background, he has no worker qualities," and rejected the appeal. Then Wang Zhengmin, a corrupt former judicial officer of the Ningbo Municipal People's Court, arrested Feng Zhenyuan indiscriminately based on the "charges" fabricated by the unscrupulous capitalist and sentenced him to three months in prison with a one-year reprieve. Wei Jianyi, the vice president of the court, also vaguely "approved" the verdict. When Feng Zhenyuan's mother went to bail him, Feng had already been illegally detained for 28 days. During the struggle, Feng Zhenyuan wrote to the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions and the former Ningbo Times, but did not receive support. It was not until the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements began that Feng Zhenyuan wrote a letter to Rao Shushi, Chairman of the East China Military and Political Committee, explaining the whole case. After the CPC Zhejiang Provincial Committee, Ningbo Prefectural Committee, and Ningbo Municipal Committee sent special personnel to conduct a serious investigation and ordered Liu Defu and others to thoroughly confess and review their mistakes, the truth was revealed.

The second case is that of Pan Xiangqiu, a working woman in Yuqian County, who suffered persecution by local cadres in the struggle against bad elements who had infiltrated the revolutionary ranks.

Pan Xiangqiu lived in Dongjia Village, Zaoxi Township, Qiandong District, Yuqian County. During the land reform, Ou Zhumei (the wife of Kong Tao, the secretary of the district committee, and a landlord class element who had infiltrated the revolutionary ranks), who led the land reform in the village, shielded landlords and treated Pan Xiangqiu unfairly because she was a widow, and did not allocate the land and houses she deserved to Pan. For this reason, Pan Xiangqiu repeatedly asked Wang Rongxing, another district cadre who was leading the land reform in the village, to fairly and reasonably handle her problem, and exposed Ou Zhumei's mistakes in shielding landlords. However, Wang Rongxing always ignored her. On the evening of March 12, 1951, Wang Rongxing held a farmers' association group meeting in the village, and Pan Xiangqiu brought her three-year-old daughter who was suffering from measles to the meeting. At the meeting, Pan Xiangqiu again asked Wang Rongxing to resolve the land issue reasonably. Not only did Wang Rongxing not resolve it, but he also slammed the table and yelled, instigating militia member Lin Yanggen and others to tie up Pan Xiangqiu, beat her, and push her out the door. Pan Xiangqiu's daughter died the next night due to fright and exposure to the cold. Pan Xiangqiu suffered such a serious blow and was extremely grief-stricken. She carried her child's corpse to the Qiandong District People's Government to appeal, but Kong Tao, the former secretary of the Qiandong District Committee, shielded his landlord-born wife and bad element Wang Rongxing, listened to his wife Ou Zhumei and bad element Wang Rongxing's slanders against Pan Xiangqiu, and said that Pan carrying a corpse to appeal was a "mad woman." On one occasion, Kong Tao even allowed Ma Baoren, the district's correspondent, to tie up Pan Xiangqiu and hang her for more than ten minutes. Pan Xiangqiu wanted to go to Yuqian County to appeal, but the district refused to issue her a pass and restricted her freedom of movement. When the county sent someone to investigate, Kong Tao and Wang Rongxing jointly blocked the truth of the incident and fabricated false reports. After Kong Tao was transferred to work in the county, Gao Yongtai and Ming Baochai, who succeeded him as secretaries of the Qiandong District Committee, also adopted an extremely irresponsible and bad attitude towards Pan Xiangqiu's problem. After the provincial government ordered the cancellation of the pass, Pan Xiangqiu went to Yuqian County three times, Lin'an Special District twice, and begged her way to Hangzhou, the seat of the provincial government, twice, and appealed to the Yuqian County People's Government, Yuqian County People's Court, Lin'an Branch of the Provincial People's Court, and the Provincial People's Procuratorate. However, her just struggle not only did not receive full support, but was further suppressed and persecuted. Liang Zhen, the deputy secretary of the CPC Yuqian County Committee and County Governor, and Wu Xianxiang, the deputy county governor and president of the court, listened to the slander of Pan Xiangqiu by bad element Wang Rongxing and bad cadre Kong Tao in handling the case of Pan Xiangqiu's persecution, believed the false reports of the cadres, did not go deep into the masses to investigate the truth, and always treated Pan Xiangqiu as a "mad woman," "hooligan," and "rascal." They regarded Pan Xiangqiu's just demands and just struggle as "making a lot of noise and affecting work," "intentionally framing cadres," and "having bad elements behind her." At first, they repeatedly refused to meet her. Although Wu Xianxiang met her on January 26 this year, Wu emphasized that there were already investigation materials (referring to false reports) and did not listen to Pan Xiangqiu's appeal at all. Pan criticized Wu Xianxiang on the spot for "shielding Wang Rongxing and not solving problems for the hard-working farmers." Wu Xianxiang became ashamed and angry, abused his power, consulted with Liang Zhen, and with Liang Zhen's decision, Wu Xianxiang instructed that "in order to protect the safety of cadres, Pan Xiangqiu should be arrested according to law." As a result, Pan Xiangqiu and her child were arrested and imprisoned. Pan Xiangqiu resolutely protested against such illegal and undisciplined behavior that violated human rights in prison, but was insulted and beaten by the guards and forced to wear handcuffs for three hours. After Pan Xiangqiu was released from prison after being detained for nine days, she went to Lin'an Special District twice and the Provincial People's Procuratorate twice to appeal and persisted in her struggle. However, when Pan Xiangqiu returned to the county, Liang Zhen and Wu Xianxiang were so bold and reckless that they arrested Pan again and imprisoned her on the grounds of "obstructing official duties." Pan Xiangqiu resolutely protested again in prison and was beaten again and forced to wear shackles for two days and one night. Pan Xiangqiu was only released when the Lin'an Special Office ordered the Yuqian County Government to release Pan Xiangqiu when the truth came out, but she had been detained for 77 days.

The Lin'an Branch of the Provincial People's Court also made extremely serious bureaucratic errors in handling Pan Xiangqiu's appeal. Xiao Fangzhou (Commissioner of the Lin'an Special Office), who was also the president of the court, did not pay attention to the case and allowed his subordinates to handle it haphazardly. Ge Xingtian (former personnel), the head of the court's trial division, and Dong Wende (Communist Party member), the secretary of judicial administration, initially refused to accept the case on the grounds that they were "engaging in the 'Three-Anti' movement." After Pan Xiangqiu's repeated requests, they perfunctorily sent Pan's oral complaint to the Yuqian County People's Court for investigation and handling. Finally, they casually replied based on a false report sent by the Yuqian County People's Court that distorted the facts and slandered Pan Xiangqiu: "If this woman continues to be incorrigible and lawless, she can be punished as an ordinary criminal at any time." When the Provincial People's Procuratorate investigated the case, the court still irresponsibly forwarded the so-called "materials" in the false report that distorted the facts and the absurd so-called "instructions" to the Provincial People's Procuratorate. After the Provincial People's Procuratorate conducted investigations with relevant units many times based on Pan Xiangqiu's appeal and the truth of the whole case was revealed, the CPC Lin'an Prefectural Committee and the Lin'an Special Office did not pay enough attention to this serious illegal and undisciplined major case of human rights violation. Although the CPC Lin'an Prefectural Committee made a preliminary analysis and criticism of the case at the enlarged meeting of the Prefectural Committee, it neither went down to inspect and handle it personally nor punished the relevant personnel. Instead, it handed over the aftermath of the case to Liang Zhen, Wu Xianxiang, and Dong Wende for handling. Liang Zhen and Wu Xianxiang still insisted that Pan Xiangqiu was a "hooligan and rascal." It was not until the CPC Zhejiang Provincial Committee issued a notice, severely criticizing this error, instructing the Lin'an Prefectural Committee to seriously handle it, and punishing the relevant personnel within the party, that it aroused the attention of the Lin'an Prefectural Committee and the Yuqian County Committee. Gao Fulong, the secretary of the current Lin'an Prefectural Committee, Liu Junzhi, the director of the organization department, Chen Xia, the deputy commissioner of the Lin'an Special Office, Wu Xianxiang, the former deputy county governor and president of the Yuqian County Court, and Zhang Sude, the director of the Lin'an Office of the Provincial Democratic Women's Federation, went to Dongjia Village on October 14 to review the materials of the case and expressed their condolences to Pan Xiangqiu. They told her the decision of the Zhejiang Provincial People's Government and the CPC Zhejiang Provincial Committee to handle the case, praised her spirit of upholding the truth and fighting, satisfied her reasonable demands for land and the fruits of struggle, arrested and brought to justice the bad element Wang Rongxing, and decided to hold a mass meeting in the whole district for the cadres who committed errors to make public self-criticisms.

The third case is that of Gu Boxian, a handmade paper worker in Xiaoshan County, who suffered persecution by local cadres in the struggle against the corrupt behavior of village cadres.

Gu Boxian lived in Dongshan Village, Changtan Township, Daicun District, Xiaoshan County, and his family background was poor peasant. After liberation, he was very active in labor production and farmers' association work, and was elected by the masses as a member of the village evaluation committee. In October 1951, when the village held a meeting to evaluate models, Gu Boxian asked the village chief Gu Guanxing and others to settle the accounts of collective embezzlement of agricultural taxes, the fruits of struggle, and production loans (the amount verified was 3,000 catties of rice, and the masses reflected that it was more than this) because of the village chief Gu Guanxing and others. The village chief ignored him; Huang Quanxing, the director of the township farmers' association who was present, did not support him either. In December, the village cadres retaliated against Gu Boxian and revoked all his posts on the grounds of "sabotaging the evaluation of models." When the "Three-Anti" movement began in February 1952, Gu Boxian actively collected materials on Gu Guanxing's embezzlement and reported them to the township government. Unexpectedly, Huang Quanxing, the director of the township farmers' association, told the reported person about the materials. In order to escape investigation, the village chief Gu Guanxing and others forged accounts. Gu Boxian reported to the township government again. However, Huang Quanxing rudely reprimanded Gu, saying: "'Three-Anti' is an internal matter, you don't need to worry about it!" "You are tearing down the affection! I know that the village cadres are embezzling, but the village chief is not embezzling much." Seeing that the reports to the township government had no results several times, Gu Boxian entrusted Gu Deqing to take a copy of the report materials to Linpu Town in March, and Gu Wangcheng, the son of Gu Deqing, handed it over to the Linpu Town Police Station. After receiving the materials, the Linpu Town Police Station immediately reported them to the Daicun District People's Government; the district then pushed them to the township. Huang Quanxing, the director of the township farmers' association, found Gu Deqing, who brought the materials, and threatened him, saying: "Your son's reporting materials are all in my hands. Don't say these few sheets, even if there are hundreds or thousands of sheets, the Linpu Town Police Station can't do anything about me anyway!" This showed a serious domineering style. Huang Quanxing was extremely dissatisfied with Gu Boxian's reporting of the village cadres' embezzlement, and Gu Guanxing and others falsely accused Gu Boxian of "colluding with bad elements and preparing to overthrow the village regime." Huang Quanxing and others launched various attacks on Gu. At noon on July 10 this year, Chen Zhengxing, the township chief of the township, called Gu Boxian to the township government for a "talk." After Gu Boxian arrived at the township government and said a few words, Huang Quanxing, Deputy Township Chief Ding Yizhai, and Township Clerk Dai Songting tied his hands behind his back and hung him on the beam for half an hour, and he was forced to urinate and defecate; then he was pushed into a "cellar" more than a zhang deep. Township Chief Chen Zhengxing did not stop Huang Quanxing and others from acting recklessly. It was not until after 4 pm, after Gu Boxian's mother begged repeatedly, that he was pulled out and released on "bail." Gu's right arm was severely injured by being tied up and hung, and has not healed to this day, and he cannot work. Gu Boxian went to Xiaoshan County twice to appeal to the county chief; neither time did he arouse the attention of the county leaders. Gu appealed to the county procuratorate for the third time. After investigation by the procuratorate, the county government instructed the procuratorate to give Huang Quanxing two major demerits and dealt with it hastily. While they gave Huang Quanxing a demerit, they still believed the false report of the district government, and did not realize that the report of the district government did not match the investigation materials of the county procuratorate. They still believed that Gu Boxian "had a bad historical background" and "intentionally colluded with bad elements to sabotage the village regime." Therefore, they instructed the district government to "educate Gu Boxian so that he can reform in the future." Seeing that the county government and the county procuratorate did not solve the problem, Gu Boxian appealed to the county court on August 7. The county court pushed it to the district for handling; the district government simply ignored it. Gu went to the Provincial People's Court twice on August 12 and 21 to appeal. The Provincial People's Court introduced Gu to the county court for handling both times. Kan?Ji, the president of the county court, not only did not pay attention to this, but expressed dissatisfaction with Gu's appeal to the province. It was not until Gu Boxian appealed to the Provincial People's Court for the third time that it aroused the attention of the leaders of the Provincial Court. Now, after detailed investigation by the People's Supervision Committee of the Zhejiang Provincial People's Government, the whole case has been clarified.

The Zhejiang Provincial People's Government and the Discipline Inspection Commission of the CPC Zhejiang Provincial Committee have seriously dealt with the illegal and derelict personnel: Liu Defu, Deputy Mayor of Ningbo City, Director of the Municipal Labor Bureau, and President of the Municipal People's Court, has been administratively removed from all his concurrent positions with the approval of the East China Military and Political Committee, and his membership in the Municipal Committee has been revoked within the party; Liang Zhen, the County Governor of Yuqian County, and Wu Xianxiang, the Deputy County Governor, have been ordered to make public self-criticisms to the masses and have been removed from their posts, and all of Liang Zhen's work within the party has been revoked; Kong Tao, the Secretary of the Qiandong District Committee of Yuqian County, has been decided to be expelled from the party; Jiao Fude, the District Governor of Daicun District of Xiaoshan County, and Dai Songting, the Deputy Director and Clerk of the Farmers' Association of Changtan Township of the district, have been removed from their posts and ordered to make public self-criticisms to the masses, and Jiao Fude has been given a "public warning" within the party. Other relevant personnel have also been given administrative punishments or ordered to conduct in-depth self-criticisms. Wang Rongxing, the Secretary of the Qiandong District People's Government, Huang Xingquan, the Director of the Farmers' Association of Changtan Township, Daicun District, Xiaoshan County, Ding Yizhai, the Deputy Township Chief, and Mao Rongshou, the unscrupulous capitalist of the private Yuxing Cigarette Factory in Ningbo City, who seriously violated human rights, have been transferred by the Provincial People's Government to the Zhejiang Provincial People's Court for sentencing according to law. The actions of Feng Zhenyuan, Pan Xiangqiu, and Gu Boxian in resolutely safeguarding the truth have been praised and condolences have been expressed; and their reasonable demands have been resolved.

    浙江省人民政府、中共浙江省委纪律检查委员会
    严正处理干部侵犯人权的三个重大案件
    浙江省人民政府、中共浙江省委纪律检查委员会，最近调查处理了宁波市、于潜县、萧山县和临安专区某些干部严重地漠视人民群众利益，丧失立场，侵犯人权的三件重大案件，对犯错误的干部已分别根据情节轻重，给予处分；对违法分子并已逮捕法办。
    第一件是宁波市制烟工人冯镇元在与不法资本家毛荣寿的违法行为进行斗争中，遭受不法资本家的阴谋陷害和当地政府机关干部的迫害案。
    冯镇元是宁波市私营裕星烟厂（前裕昌烟厂）工人中的积极分子，在解放之初，就曾检举该厂不法资本家毛荣寿腐蚀税局驻厂员，进行偷税、漏税的犯罪行为。毛荣寿为了继续施放“五毒”，就阴谋诬害冯镇元，破坏工会。在许多次阴谋遭到冯镇元的反击失败后，毛荣寿在一九五○年六月藉口
    “淡季”、“生产困难”（事实上是他自己收买了会计，预先抽逃了大批资金），要解雇包括冯镇元在内的二十五个工人。冯镇元识破了毛荣寿的新阴谋，团结了厂内的进步工人，据理力争；三次在劳资协商会上用具体事实和算细账的方法驳得毛荣寿哑口无言。
    但毛荣寿仍坚持解雇工人，以致协商无结果，遂由劳动局处理。主持处理此案件的宁波市人民政府干部，以该市副市长兼市人民法院院长、市劳动局局长刘德甫为首，表现了极端恶劣的官僚主义态度。刘德甫和当时宁波市劳动局实际负责人王少云（劳动局秘书科长）对冯镇元的正义斗争毫不支持，只轻信某些干部的片面汇报，便盲目地强调照顾资本家“生产困难”，并说冯镇元有“政治问题”，同意把冯镇元从劳资协商代表中排挤出去。结果，冯镇元便被不法资本家毛荣寿所操纵的“劳资协商会”“协议”解雇。冯镇元坚持斗争，曾写信给刘德甫要求支援，刘置之不理，并批准了“解雇协议”。冯镇元到宁波市人民法院提出控告。不法资本家毛荣寿收买的该厂工会副主席蔡隆甫，拿了劳动局的介绍信到法院与冯镇元“斗争”。宁波市人民法院副院长魏鉴一等只凭劳动局的意见，即判决不法资本家解雇冯镇元。冯镇元不服，又向省人民法院宁波分院上诉，并坚决拒绝离厂。不法资本家毛荣寿这时就给冯镇元捏造了“违反协议”、“侮辱政府”、
    “破坏生产”等罪名，以三百万元“活动费”勾通黑律师收买了宁波市人民法院旧司法人员王正民，陷害冯镇元。一九五○年十二月二十六日，冯镇元在省人民法院宁波分院被审判员冯禾青无端训斥了一顿。法院秘书毛尹连见都没见过冯镇元一面，便在判决主文上批了“冯镇元虽系工人出身，但无工人品质”，驳回上诉。接着宁波市人民法院贪赃枉法的旧司法人员王正民便根据不法资本家所捏造的那些“罪名”，不分青红皂白地把冯镇元押了起来，判处徒刑三月，缓刑一年。该院副院长魏鉴一也就糊里糊涂地“批准”了这个判决。到冯镇元的母亲前往保释时，冯已被非法扣押二十八天。在斗争过程中，冯镇元曾投书市总工会、前宁波时报，但都未得到支持。直到“三反”“五反”运动开始，冯镇元将全案经过写信向华东军政委员会饶漱石主席申诉，经中共浙江省委、宁波地委、宁波市委派专人进行认真调查，责令刘德甫等彻底交代并检讨自己的错误，事实真相才被调查清楚。
    第二件是于潜县劳动妇女潘香球在与混入革命队伍的坏分子进行斗争中遭受当地干部的迫害案。
    潘香球住在于潜县潜东区藻溪乡董家村。土地改革中，在该村领导土地改革的区干部欧诸梅（区委书记孔涛的妻子、混入革命队伍的地主阶级分子）包庇地主，并欺潘香球是寡妇，没有合理地分配给潘应得的土地房屋。为此潘香球曾多次向在该村领导土地改革的另一区干部王荣星要求公平合理处理自己的问题，并揭发欧诸梅包庇地主的错误。但王荣星始终置之不理。一九五一年三月十二日晚上，王荣星在该村召开农会小组会，潘香球带着她的正出麻疹的三岁女孩也来开会。会上，潘香球又向王荣星提出合理解决土地问题的要求。王荣星不但不给解决，反而拍桌大骂，唆使民兵林杨根等将潘香球捆起殴打后推出门外。潘香球的女孩因受惊吓和受风寒，在第二天夜即夭折。潘香球遭受如此严重的打击，悲愤异常。她背着孩子的尸体到潜东区区人民政府申诉，但前潜东区区委书记孔涛却包庇自己地主出身的老婆和坏分子王荣星，听信他的老婆欧诸梅和坏分子王荣星对潘香球的污蔑，说潘背尸申诉是“癫婆子”。有一次孔涛竟听任区里的通讯员麻保仁把潘香球捆吊十余分钟。潘香球要到于潜县里去申诉，区里不发给通行证，限制她的行动自由。当县里派人来调查时，孔涛又与王荣星共同封锁事件的真实情况，编造假报告。孔涛调县工作后，继任潜东区区委书记的高永泰、明宝才也对潘香球的问题采取了极不负责任的恶劣态度。省府明令取消通行证后，潘香球曾三到于潜县，两到临安专区，两次行乞到省府所在地杭州，向于潜县人民政府、于潜县人民法院、省人民法院临安分院、省人民检察署申诉。但她的正义斗争不仅没有得到充分支持，反而进一步遭受了压制和迫害。中共于潜县委副书记兼县长梁震、副县长兼法院院长吴献祥在受理潘香球遭受迫害的案件中，听信坏分子王荣星、坏干部孔涛对潘香球的污蔑，轻信干部的假报告，并未深入群众切实调查真相，始终把潘香球当作“癫婆子”、“流氓”、“无赖”对待。对潘香球的正义要求和正义斗争，则认为是“大吵大闹、影响工作”、“蓄意诬告干部”、“有坏分子在背后掌握”。他们起初一再拒绝接见，后虽在今年一月二十六日由吴献祥接见，但吴却强调已有调查材料（指假报告），根本不听潘香球的申诉。潘当场批评吴献祥“包庇王荣星，不给劳苦农民解决问题”，吴献祥竟羞恼成怒，滥用职权，经与梁震会商并经梁震决定，由吴献祥批示“为保障干部安全，应依法将潘香球逮捕。”结果，潘香球和她的孩子都被逮捕下狱。潘香球在狱中坚决抗议此种违法乱纪、侵犯人权的行为，但竟被看守员辱打，并被强制带手铐三小时。潘香球被押九天出狱后，又两次到临安专区，两次到省人民检察署申诉，坚持斗争。但当潘香球回县后，梁震、吴献祥竟胆大妄为，以“妨害公务”的罪名将潘再次逮捕下狱。潘香球在狱中再次坚决抗议，竟又遭殴打，并被强制带脚镣两天一夜。直到案情大白，临安专署下令于潜县府将潘香球释放时，潘香球才获得自由，但已被押七十七天。
    省人民法院临安分院在受理潘香球的申诉时，也犯了极严重的官僚主义错误。该院兼院长萧方洲（临安专署专员）对该案不予重视，听任下面干部胡乱处理。该院审判股长葛星天（旧人员）和司法行政秘书董文德（共产党员），初则藉口“正在搞‘三反’”根本不予受理；后经潘香球一再请求，才敷衍塞责地把潘的口诉状发交于潜县人民法院调查处理；最后，竟根据于潜县人民法院送来的一份歪曲事实、对潘香球横加污蔑谩骂的假报告，信手批复：“该妇女如再屡教不改，无法无天的乱搞下去，也可按普通刑事犯随时惩处之。”当省人民检察署调查此案时，该院竟仍毫不负责地将这份假报告中歪曲事实的所谓“材料”及其荒谬绝伦的所谓“批示”，转呈省人民检察署。省人民检察署根据潘香球的申诉，多次会同有关单位进行调查，使全案真相大白后，中共临安地委、临安专署对此严重违法乱纪、侵犯人权的重大案件，并未引起足够重视。中共临安地委虽在地委扩大会议上对此案作了初步的分析和批判，但既未亲自下去检查处理，又未对有关人员加以处分，反而把此案善后事宜交给梁震、吴献祥及董文德去处理。而梁震、吴献祥当时仍坚称潘香球是“流氓无赖”。直到中共浙江省委发出通报，严厉批判了这一错误，指令临安地委认真处理，并在党内处分了有关人员之后，方引起临安地委、于潜县委的重视。现临安地委书记高复隆、组织部长刘俊芝、临安专署副专员陈侠、前于潜县副县长兼法院院长吴献祥、省民主妇联临安办事处主任张素德等，已于十月十四日亲往董家村复核该案材料并慰问潘香球，将浙江省人民政府、中共浙江省委处理本案的决定告诉她，表扬她坚持真理、进行斗争的精神，满足她对土地、斗争果实的合理要求，逮捕法办坏分子王荣星，并决定召开全区群众大会由犯错误的干部当众检讨。
    第三件是萧山县手工造纸工人顾伯贤在与乡村干部贪污行为进行斗争中，遭受当地干部迫害案。
    顾伯贤住萧山县戴村区长潭乡东山村，家庭成份贫农。解放后对劳动生产及农会工作都很积极，曾被群众选任村评选委员等职。一九五一年十月村里开评选模范会时，顾伯贤因村长顾关兴等集体贪污农业税、斗争果实及生产贷款等（已查明者为三千斤大米，群众反映尚不止此数），要求村长算清账目。该村长置之不理；在场的乡农会主任黄泉兴也不予支持。十二月，村干部即对顾伯贤施行报复，以“破坏评模”为名，撤销顾的一切职务。一九五二年二月“三反”运动开始，顾伯贤即积极搜集顾关兴等贪污材料，向乡政府检举。不料乡农会主任黄泉兴却将该项材料告知被检举者。村长顾关兴等为逃避追查，即伪造账目。顾伯贤又报告了乡政府。但黄泉兴竟蛮横地斥责顾说：“‘三反’是内部事情，不用你管！”“你这样撕得下情面！村干贪污我是知道的，村长侵吞不多。”顾伯贤见向乡政府数次检举无结果，乃于三月间将检举材料一份托顾德庆带往临浦镇，由顾德庆之子顾望成交给临浦镇派出所。临浦镇派出所收到该项材料后，即转报戴村区人民政府；区又推到乡。乡农会主任黄泉兴即找带材料的顾德庆恐吓说：“你儿子的检举材料都在我手里，不要说这几张，就是成百成千张，临浦镇派出所反正办不了我！”表现了严重的强横霸道作风。黄泉兴对于顾伯贤检举村干部贪污的行为极为不满，加以顾关兴等又反诬顾伯贤“勾结坏分子、准备推翻村政权”，黄泉兴等遂对顾多方打击。本年七月十日中午，该乡乡长陈正兴叫顾伯贤到乡政府去“谈话”。顾伯贤到乡政府谈不上几句话，就被黄泉兴及副乡长丁易斋、乡文书戴松庭将双手反绑，吊在梁上达半小时，大小便均被吊出；以后又被推进一丈多深的“地窖”中。乡长陈正兴眼见黄泉兴等胡作非为，竟不加阻止。直到午后四时许，经顾伯贤的母亲再三求饶，才把顾拉出，“取保”释放。顾右臂被捆吊重伤，至今未愈，不能劳动。顾伯贤曾两次到萧山县找县长申诉；均未引起县领导上重视。顾第三次到县检察署申诉。经检察署调查后，县府才批示检察署给黄泉兴记大过二次处分，草率了事。他们一面虽给黄泉兴记过，一面仍相信区政府的假报告，对区政府的报告与县检察署调查材料不相符合，亦毫无所觉，仍认为顾伯贤“历史成份不好”“有意勾结坏分子破坏村政权”，因此又批示区政府“对顾伯贤加以教育，以使其今后改造。”顾伯贤因见县府、县检察署不给解决问题，八月七日又向县法院申诉。县法院竟推给区里处理；区政府则干脆不管。八月十二、二十一日顾两次到省人民法院申诉。省人民法院两次都把顾介绍给县法院处理。县法院院长阚?玑不但不因此引起重视，反而对顾向省申诉表示不满。直到顾伯贤第三次上省人民法院申诉后，才引起省法院领导上的重视。现经过浙江省人民政府人民监察委员会详细调查后，全部案情已弄清楚。
    浙江省人民政府、中共浙江省委纪律检查委员会，已对各违法失职人员分别作了严正处理：对宁波市人民政府副市长兼市劳动局局长、市人民法院院长刘德甫，经呈请华东军政委员会批准，行政上给予撤销本兼各职的处分，党内撤销其市委委员职务；对于潜县人民政府县长梁震、副县长吴献祥除责令向群众公开检讨外，给予撤职处分，并撤销梁震党内一切工作；对于潜县潜东区区委书记孔涛已决定开除其党籍；对萧山县戴村区区长焦福德、该区长潭乡农会副主任兼文书戴松庭均给予撤职处分，并责令向群众公开检讨，并给予焦福德党内“当众警告处分”。对其他有关人员亦分别给了行政处分，或责令其进行深刻检讨。对严重侵犯人权的潜东区人民政府秘书王荣星，萧山县戴村区长潭乡农会主任黄兴泉、副乡长丁易斋，宁波市私营裕星烟厂不法资本家毛荣寿等均由省人民政府移送浙江省人民法院依法判处徒刑。对冯镇元、潘香球、顾伯贤三人坚决维护真理的行为，则进行了表扬与慰问；并解决了他们的合理要求。
