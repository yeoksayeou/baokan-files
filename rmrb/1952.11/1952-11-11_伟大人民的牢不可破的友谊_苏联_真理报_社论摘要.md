The "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month" has already begun on November 7th.

The alliance and friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union are developing and consolidating year by year. After the victory of the Chinese People's Revolution, the Soviet government was the first to establish diplomatic relations with the Chinese government. The Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance and various agreements signed by the two great powers of the Soviet Union and China in the Kremlin on February 14, 1950, vividly demonstrated the friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union. These documents mark a new era in the development and consolidation of friendship between the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union.

Mao Zedong, the leader of the Chinese people, wrote: "The Soviet government and people...have given the Chinese government and people warm and generous assistance, which has greatly helped the recovery and development of the new Chinese economy and the consolidation of the country."

The peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union is working tirelessly for world peace. The Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, which are engaged in peaceful construction labor, cannot have any kind of aggressive intentions. The Soviet Union and China are striving for international peace and security and opposing the aggressive plans of the American imperialists; they are developing the civilian sectors of the economy and improving the welfare of the people with all their strength. The strong alliance and friendship between the two peoples are developing along these lines.

Comrade Stalin said: “The great friendship between the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China is a reliable guarantee against the threat of new aggression and a strong fortress of peace in the Far East and the world.”

Professor A.I. Ginisov, Chairman of the Soviet Society for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, told a Pravda reporter:

“The Sino-Soviet Friendship Month” is a major and pleasant event.

In China, "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month" is being carried out under the initiative of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association. This organization has tens of millions of members, and it is carrying out significant and beneficial work - spreading the idea of friendship with the Soviet Union among the Chinese people.

We have received many books, periodicals, photographs and other materials reflecting the political, economic and cultural life of the People's Republic of China from the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association. We distributed these materials to libraries, museums, universities and other domestic organizations so that the general public could see them.

The works of Chinese writers and poets have been translated into Russian and the languages of other Soviet nationalities and widely disseminated in the Soviet Union. The publishing bureaus of Moscow, Leningrad, and Irkutsk alone have recently published a large number of translations of works by Chinese writers and poets, including Lu Xun, Mao Dun, Ding Ling, Zhou Libo, Ai Qing and others.

Famous figures in Soviet culture, science, and art, as well as outstanding workers in industry and agriculture, have also visited the People's Republic of China at the invitation of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association.

The Soviets who visited China saw the achievements of our Chinese friends with their own eyes, and exchanged knowledge and experience with them.

Ginisov talked about the "Soviet-Chinese Friendship Month" activities scheduled to be launched in the Soviet Union.

Soviet leaders in science and culture are preparing to give reports and speeches and hold exhibitions to introduce the victories of the Chinese working people in building a new life and the great friendship between the two peoples. For example, the All-Union Society for the Dissemination of Political and Scientific Knowledge is preparing to hold lectures on the following topics: the Chinese people in the struggle for peace, the great friendship between the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, the first volume of Selected Works of Mao Zedong, etc. The Museum of Oriental Culture is preparing to hold a public lecture in the Cultural Palace of the Stalin Automobile Factory on the topic of "The Culture and Art of the Chinese People Past and Present." An exhibition on the literature of the People's Republic of China has opened at the National Lenin Library.

The main literary, drama and music radio broadcasting departments and the Central Television Station are preparing radio programs about Chinese art and literature and about Sino-Soviet friendship. The programs will include lectures on the works of the most famous Chinese writers, radio dramas "Li Youcai's Rhymes" and "The White-Haired Girl", songs "Friendship of the Chinese and Soviet People" and "The East is Red" and the films "Steel Warrior" and "Liberated China". There are also many Chinese music programs, including works by Xian Xinghai, Nie Er, He Luting and several folk songs.

A delegation of Soviet cultural workers and the Red Flag Song and Dance Ensemble of the Soviet Army led by B.A. Alexandrov have arrived in China to participate in the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month."

Ginisov concluded by saying: All the Soviet people are very happy to see how the Chinese people, under the leadership of the heroic Chinese Communist Party and their long-tested leader Mao Zedong, are changing their lives politically, economically and culturally. They sincerely hope that the great friendship between the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union - the strong fortress of peace and security in the Far East and the world - will be further strengthened and developed.

Wish the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month" further develop the great friendship between the two great peoples!

    伟大人民的牢不可破的友谊
    ——苏联“真理报”社论摘要
    “中苏友好月”已在十一月七日开始了。
    中苏两国人民间的同盟和友谊一年比一年发展和巩固。在中国人民革命取得胜利后，苏联政府首先与中国政府建立了外交关系。一九五○年二月十四日苏中两个大国在克里姆林宫签订的中苏友好同盟互助条约和各项协定，生动地表现了中苏两国人民间的友情。这些文件标志着中华人民共和国和苏联之间友谊的发展和巩固的新纪元。
    中国人民领袖毛泽东写道：“苏联政府和人民……给予中国政府和人民热诚的、慷慨的援助，这些援助大大帮助了新中国经济的恢复和发展及国家的巩固。”
    以苏联为首的和平民主阵营正在为世界和平不倦地工作着。正在从事和平建设劳动的苏联和中华人民共和国都不可能有任何种类的侵略意图。苏联和中国都在争取国际和平与安全、反对美帝国主义者的侵略计划；它们正以全副力量发展经济中的民用部门和增进人民的福利。两国人民之间的牢固同盟和友谊正是沿着这样的路线发展着。
    斯大林同志说：“苏联和中华人民共和国之间的伟大友谊是反对新侵略威胁的可靠保证，是远东及全世界和平的坚强堡垒。”
    苏联对外文化协会主席阿·伊·吉尼索夫教授对真理报记者说：
    “中苏友好月”是一个重大的、令人愉快的事件。
    在中国，“中苏友好月”正在中苏友好协会总会的发起下进行中。这个团体拥有数千万会员，它正在进行意义重大的、有益的工作——在中国人民中间传播与苏联友好的思想。
    我们接到了中苏友好协会总会寄来的反映中华人民共和国的政治、经济和文化生活的许多书籍、期刊、照片和其他材料。我们把这些材料分给了图书馆、博物馆、高等学校和国内其他团体，使广大的群众可以看得见。
    中国作家和诗人的作品已译成俄文和苏联其他民族的语文在苏联广泛地传布着。单是莫斯科、列宁格勒和伊尔库次克的出版局，最近就大量出版了许多中国作家和诗人的作品的译本，其中包括鲁迅、茅盾、丁玲、周立波、艾青等人的作品。
    苏联文化、科学、艺术方面的著名人物、工业和农业中的杰出工作者也应中苏友好协会的邀请访问了中华人民共和国。
    访问中国的苏联人都亲眼看到了我们的中国朋友的成就，和他们交流了知识和经验。
    吉尼索夫谈到预定在苏联展开的“苏中友好月”活动。
    苏联的科学和文化界领袖都在准备作报告和演讲以及举办展览会，来介绍中国劳动人民在建设新生活中所取得的胜利以及两国人民之间的伟大友谊。例如全苏政治与科学知识普及协会正在筹备举办关于下面几个问题的讲演会：在争取和平的斗争中的中国人民，苏联和中华人民共和国的伟大友谊，毛泽东选集第一卷等等。东方文化博物馆正筹备在斯大林汽车工厂的文化宫内举办一次公开演讲会，题目是“中国人民过去和现在的文化和艺术”。关于中华人民共和国文学的展览会已在国立列宁图书馆开幕。
    主要的文学、戏剧和音乐无线电广播部门和中央电视广播台，正在准备关于中国艺术和文学以及关于中苏友好的广播节目。节目中将包括关于最著名的中国作家的作品的讲座，广播剧“李有才板话”和“白毛女”，歌曲“中苏人民友好”和“东方红”以及影片“钢铁战士”和“解放了的中国”。还有许多中国音乐节目，其中包括冼星海、聂耳、贺绿汀的作品以及若干民歌。
    苏联文化工作者代表团和以鲍·亚·亚历山大罗夫为首的苏军红旗歌舞团已到中国参加“中苏友好月”。
    吉尼索夫最后说：苏联全体人民都很高兴地看到中国人民如何在英雄的中国共产党和他们的久经考验的领袖毛泽东领导下，正在政治、经济和文化方面改变自己的生活。他们衷心地希望中华人民共和国和苏联两国之间的伟大友谊——远东以及全世界和平与安全的坚强堡垒——进一步加强和发展。
    祝“中苏友好月”使两国伟大人民的伟大友谊进一步发展！
