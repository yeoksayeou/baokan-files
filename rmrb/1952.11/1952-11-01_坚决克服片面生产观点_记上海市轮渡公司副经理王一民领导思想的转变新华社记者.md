    Resolutely Overcome One-Sided Production Viewpoint
    ——On the Transformation of Leadership Thought of Wang Yimin, Deputy Manager of Shanghai Ferry Company

    "This major safety and hygiene inspection thoroughly criticized my management thinking of 'only focusing on production and neglecting safety,' giving me the most profound political lesson." After the safety and hygiene inspection, Wang Yimin, deputy manager of Shanghai Ferry Company, told the reporter the story of the change in his leadership thinking.
    In the past, the ferry company had many work-related injuries. Workers often complained: The engine room on the ship is too hot! The hand-operated vehicles should be improved! There are too few toilets! Wang Yimin was so anxious sitting in his office that he didn't know what to do. He thought: In the past, the company didn't have any equipment, but since liberation, a lot of equipment has been added to the ships and docks, bathrooms, dormitories... Why are the workers still complaining? "It must be that the workers' simple welfare viewpoint is too strong, and they don't consider that the company has to break even." The workers on the ship are very busy during the day, and at night they fight with bedbugs as soon as they get into bed, and then it's dawn when they just fall asleep. The workers describe their mood when getting up: "It's almost like you need a crane to lift me up!" They submitted several reports asking for "DDT," but Wang Yimin thought it "did not conform to the principle of breaking even, and the many bedbugs were caused by the workers not paying attention to hygiene," so the reports were never approved. Wherever Wang Yimin went, the workers would secretly say, "Here comes 'Break Even'!"
    Over the past few years, Wang Yimin has worked actively, going to bed very late every night. However, the relationship between the leadership and the masses has always troubled him. He often thought: I am an advanced element of the working class, and isn't what I do for the company also for the working class? What is the key issue? In August, a major safety and hygiene inspection was also launched on the ships and docks of the company. He personally focused on inspecting the ships and docks on one route, asking himself to personally experience the workers' demands. However, he was still a little worried: What if the masses raise too many opinions and a lot of money is spent without solving them, and the masses become even more dissatisfied?
    The deeper Wang Yimin went, the more profound education he received. On the day before the inspection was about to begin, another work-related injury occurred in the company: Wang Xianggen, a trolley worker at the South Wharf, had two fingers crushed. In the past, the bureaucratic capitalists only cared about exploiting the workers' blood and sweat. The trolleys used to raise and lower the docks had to be operated manually. The trolley platform was more than two stories high, the ladder was upright, the platform was very narrow, there were no lights at night, and no shelter from the rain. The workers called the trolley platform the "Platform of Longing for Home." Before liberation, no one knows how many people had their fingers crushed by the gears on the platform. After liberation, a shelter was built on the platform, lights were installed, and protective covers were installed on the gears. After this accident, Wang Yimin rushed to the South Wharf. He climbed onto the trolley platform and personally felt the difficulties the workers usually faced when operating on the platform. On the platform, he angrily cursed: "These turtle bureaucratic capitalists, setting up such a thing to harm our workers!" The protective cover on the gears on the platform only had a piece of broken lead skin left, the gears were baring their teeth at him, and the workers below the platform told him: The protective cover had been worn through a long time ago, and Wang Xianggen was the third person injured after liberation. This reminded him of the workers' early request to "replace the protective cover," so he immediately instructed the technicians to design a motor to replace the manual traction of the trolley. He then rushed to the injured worker and said: "This is entirely my responsibility. I have not worked hard to improve the bad conditions left over from the old enterprise." Wang Yimin then went to the No. 22 ship to understand the situation. For many years, the engine room of this kind of coal-burning ship has been dark, narrow, and poorly ventilated. When building the ship, the bureaucratic capitalists only considered setting up more passenger seats to make more money, so the engine workers often operated in temperatures of one hundred twenty to thirty degrees. This time, when Wang Yimin went down to the cabin of the No. 22 ship to measure the temperature, he was breathless from the heat after only a few minutes, and he was already covered in sweat when he came out. His emotions were greatly stimulated, and he felt that if he did not improve such an environment, the labor competition would break down the workers. He excitedly said to the engine workers: "No matter how much money the ventilation equipment costs, no matter whether the ship looks good after opening the windows, as long as it can protect everyone's health, the company will definitely do it."
    At the company's general staff meeting, Wang Yimin made a deep self-criticism of his past ideological error of "only focusing on production and neglecting safety," and told everyone: "If you see that I still don't pay attention to safety and hygiene work in the future, go to the Municipal People's Government to sue me and have me removed from my post."
    Once the determination and attitude of the leading cadres were clear, the movement immediately unfolded vigorously. The workers went deep into various departments to conduct inspections and put forward the slogan:
    "No matter how big or small the opinion is, raising one point is a treasure," and launched an inspection competition. During the inspection, more than 500 workers raised a total of 23,000 suggestions for improving safety and hygiene. The workers inspected and found that this place was unsafe and that place would be dangerous, and Deputy Manager Wang felt that every suggestion was accusing him: "Look, how dangerous the past one-sided production viewpoint was!" The workers of the No. 22 ship silently handed a piece of rust to Wang Yimin. The matter was like this: Originally, there was only a small opening on the iron plate at the stern of this ship. When the profiteers repaired it, they should have used iron to repair it, but they used cement to coat it. Over time, the iron plate around the cement had been rusted by water. This time, the workers inspected it and quickly knocked off the rust, but a big hole appeared in the stern. Wang Yimin shook his head while holding this piece of rust. He said: "Fortunately, we inspected! If a leak occurs, the loss of the ship is a small matter, the lives of the workers and passengers are a big matter." He took this piece of rust back to the manager's office, along with other materials, and specially opened an exhibition.
    The sense of ownership of the country and the enterprise inspired every worker. When they made suggestions for improving safety and hygiene, they were all realistic and fully considered the expenses of the enterprise. At one worker's group meeting, Wang Yimin encountered such a thing: A worker suggested that "it would be best to issue a pair of long rubber boots to everyone," but everyone said that their leather shoes could be worn on rainy days, and this suggestion should be put forward in the future. The workers not only seriously carried out inspections and made suggestions, but also "solved the problems themselves," using waste materials to make many protective devices, repairing the machines themselves, and generally opening windows in the engine room... Many problems that should have cost a lot of money were solved without spending money or only spending a small amount of money after the workers discussed them. Wang Yimin realized from every matter that the workers could best understand the future of the enterprise. He always liked to tell others his experience: "Originally, I was always calculating 'break even,' but in fact, when the workers are truly mobilized, they consider it more thoroughly and correctly than I do."
    The relationship between the leadership and the masses of the Municipal Ferry Company has changed greatly. Since the launch of the major inspection, wherever Wang Yimin went, the workers there would warmly shake his hand: "Deputy Manager, you're here!" During the break, the workers even dragged him to play table tennis. Wang Yimin felt very warm and felt that the workers were really lovely. Under Wang Yimin's influence, most of the staff in the company went to the worker masses during the major inspection movement to promote and solve problems related to safety and hygiene.
    In the one month since the launch of the major safety and hygiene inspection, the Municipal Ferry Company has not had a single work-related accident, which is a miracle that has never happened before. Deputy Manager Wang Yimin said in a summary-style: "To achieve safe production in the future, to change the bad working conditions left by the old enterprise for the workers, according to my personal experience: We must resolutely overcome the one-sided production viewpoint of leading cadres neglecting safety, and to achieve this, leading cadres must first go deep down to personally experience the workers' demands. In fact, this is a question of whether we care about the well-being of the masses and whether we rely on the working class." As for whether we can launch a labor competition without carrying out a major safety and hygiene inspection? Wang Yimin answered the reporter like this: "We can also launch a labor competition! However, that would completely rely on the workers' enthusiasm and lives!"

    坚决克服片面生产观点
    ——记上海市轮渡公司副经理王一民领导思想的转变新华社记者
    贺昌华
    “这次安全卫生大检查，彻底批判了我的‘只重生产忽视安全’的经营思想，给我上了一堂最深刻的政治课”。经过安全卫生大检查后，上海市轮渡公司副经理王一民，向记者述说了他的领导思想变化的故事。
    过去市轮渡公司的工伤事故很多。工人常提出：船上的轮机舱里太热！手摇车应该改进！厕所太少了！王一民坐在办公室里急得简直没法。他认为：过去公司里什么设备也没有，解放后已经在船上、码头增设了好多设备，浴室、宿舍……怎么工人还要提意见呢？“一定是工人的单纯福利观点太浓厚，毫不考虑公司要保本自给”。船上的工人，白天工作很紧张，夜里一上床就跟臭虫打架，刚睡着又天亮了，第二天在生产中头总是昏沉沉的。工人形容起床时的心情说：“简直要用起重机才把我吊得起来！”他们打了好几次报告要“DDT”，王一民认为“与保本自给原则不符，臭虫多是工人不注意卫生造成的”，报告便没有下落。王一民走到那里，那里工人就偷偷说：“‘保本自给’来了！”
    几年来，王一民积极工作，每天夜里睡得很晚。但领导与群众的关系，却一直使他很苦恼。他常想：自己就是工人阶级的先进分子，为公司不也是为了工人阶级吗？关键问题在那里呢？八月份，安全卫生大检查在公司里所属船舶、码头上也展开了，他亲自重点掌握一条航线的船舶、码头进行检查，他要求自己去亲身体会工人的要求。但是，他仍旧有些担心：假使群众提出意见太多，花了很多的钱也解决不了，群众更要不满意了。
    王一民一深入到那里，那里就使他受到很深刻的教育。大检查刚要开始的前一天，公司里又发生了一件工伤事故：南码头摇车工人王祥根被轧断了两根手指。过去，官僚资本家只顾压榨工人的血汗，用以升降码头的摇车，要用人力来摇；摇车台距地面有两丈多高，梯子直立着；台上很窄小，夜里没有灯，下雨没有棚，工人把摇车台叫做“望乡台”，解放前被台上齿轮轧掉手指的不知有多少。解放后，台上已搭上棚，装好灯，齿轮也装制了防护罩。这次事故发生后，王一民赶到南码头。他爬上摇车台，就亲自感受到了平时工人在台上进行操作的困难，他在台上气得大骂：“官僚资本家这些乌龟，搞这么个玩样儿来害我们工人！”台上的齿轮上的防护罩，只剩下一块破铅皮，齿轮张着牙齿望着他，台下的工人告诉他：防护罩早就被磨穿了洞，王祥根受伤是解放后第三人了。这使他想起工人早就提出“换防护罩”的事情，他就马上指示技术人员设计用马达来代替人力牵动摇车。他又赶到受伤工人跟前说：“这完全是我的责任，旧企业留下的恶劣情况，我没有努力来改善好。”王一民又到二十二号轮去了解情况。像这种烧煤船的轮机舱里，好多年来都是又黑、又窄、又不通风，官僚资本家在造船时，只考虑多设乘客坐位，多赚钱，所以轮机工人就经常在一百二、三十度的高温中操作。这次，当王一民下到二十二号轮的舱里去测量温度时，只有几分钟，就被热气逼得气喘，出来时已经是满身大汗。他的感情上受到了莫大的刺激，感到不改善这样的环境，劳动竞赛会把工人搞垮的。他激动地向轮机工人说：“不管通风设备要化多少钱，不管开了窗后船好看不好看，只要能保护大家的健康，公司一定照办。”
    在全公司的职工大会上，王一民深刻检讨了他过去“只重生产忽视安全”的思想错误，向大家表示：“以后大家看到我还不重视安全卫生工作，到市人民政府去控告我，撤我的职。”
    领导干部的决心和态度一明朗，运动马上就轰轰烈烈展开了。工人们深入到各部分进行检查，提出
    “不管意见大和小，提出一点就是宝”的口号，展开了检查竞赛。在检查中，五百多工人共提出了两万三千条改进安全卫生的意见。工人们检查出这里也不安全，那里也会出危险，王副经理觉得每一条意见都在指责他：“你看，过去的片面生产观点多么危险！”二十二号轮的工人，沉默地把一块铁锈交给王一民。事情是这样：原来这只船的船尾铁板上，只有一个小口，奸商在修补时本来该用铁补，却用水泥涂上去，日子久了，水泥周围的铁板已被水锈烂。这次工人检查出来，赶快把铁锈敲下，可是船尾就出现了一个大洞。王一民拿着这块铁锈直摇头，他说：“幸亏检查！出了漏子船损失了还是小事，工人和乘客的性命是大事。”他把这块铁锈带回到经理室，连同其他材料，特别开了个展览会。
    国家和企业的主人翁感觉，鼓舞着每个工人。他们在提出改进安全卫生的意见时，都是实事求是、充分考虑到企业的开支的。在一次工人的小组会上，王一民曾碰到这样一件事：一位工人提出“顶好每人发一双长统胶靴”，但大家都说自己的皮鞋下雨天可以穿，这个意见应该放在将来再提。工人们不仅认真进行检查、提出意见，并且“自己解决问题”用废料做了许多防护装置，自己动手检修好机器，轮机舱里也普遍开好了窗……。许多该花很多钱的问题，经过工人们讨论后，变成不花钱，或只花很少的钱就得到了解决。王一民从每件事情都体会到：工人最能体谅到企业的前途。他老是喜欢向别人说出他的体会：“原来，我成天盘算‘保本自给’，其实工人们真正发动起来，比我考虑得更周到，更正确。”
    市轮渡公司的领导和群众的关系，已大大变了样。从大检查展开以后，王一民走到那里，那里的工人都亲切地跟他拉手：“副经理，你来了！”休息时，工人还拖他去打乒乓球。王一民感到很温暖，觉得工人们实在可爱。在王一民的影响下，公司里大部分职员在大检查运动中都到工人群众中去，推动与解决有关安全卫生方面的问题。
    从安全卫生大检查展开后的一个多月来，市轮渡公司已经没有发生过一件工伤事故，出现了从来没有的奇迹。副经理王一民带总结式地说：“要做到今后的安全生产，要改变旧企业给工人留下来的恶劣的劳动条件，根据我的亲身体会：必须坚决克服领导干部忽视安全的片面生产观点，而要做到这点，领导干部又必须首先深入下去亲身体会工人的要求。实际上这是一个是否关心群众疾苦、是否依靠工人阶级的问题。”至于不搞安全卫生大检查，是不是也可以展开劳动竞赛呢？王一民是这样回答记者的：“也可以搞起劳动竞赛的呀！不过，那就完全是凭工人的积极性和性命了！”
