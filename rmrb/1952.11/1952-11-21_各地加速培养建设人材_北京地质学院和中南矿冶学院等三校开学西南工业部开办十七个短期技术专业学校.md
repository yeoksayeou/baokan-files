Various Places Accelerate the Training of Construction Talents
Beijing Geological College, Central South Institute of Mining and Metallurgy, and Three Other Schools Open; Southwest Industrial Department Opens Seventeen Short-Term Technical Professional Schools

[This Newspaper’s News] The Beijing Geological College, Changsha Central South Institute of Mining and Metallurgy, and Qingdao Institute of Technology, established to create urgently needed talents for large-scale economic construction, have opened successively in early November.

Beijing Geological College was established on the basis of the geology departments of the original Peking University, Tsinghua University, Tianjin University, and Tangshan Institute of Technology. Before liberation, the geology department was regarded as a "niche" department with very few students. In the past few decades, China has cultivated a total of only eight hundred geologists. Moreover, what they learned was mostly focused on geological theory, and they learned very little about practical application courses such as resource exploration and geological drilling. Therefore, it is far from meeting the needs of China's large-scale industrial construction. This year, Beijing Geological College has enrolled 1,200 new students, and together with the existing students, the number will be equal to twice the number of geologists trained nationwide in the past few decades. The college is now preparing to build new school buildings and plans to enroll another 3,500 students next year.

Beijing Geological College, in accordance with the principle of combining long-term training with short-term training, has a four-year undergraduate program and a two-year specialized course. The undergraduate program is divided into three departments: Geological and Mineral Exploration, Hydrogeology and Engineering Geology, and Geophysical Prospecting. The students in each department have extremely high enthusiasm for learning and hope to quickly learn technical knowledge to serve the large-scale economic construction that the motherland is about to begin. In addition, the textbooks used by the college are based on the textbooks compiled by the Soviet Geology Department in 1952, which can closely link theory with practice, so that we can train a large number of geological talents who can be competent for the construction tasks of the motherland in a very short period of time.

The Central South Institute of Mining and Metallurgy was established by merging the mining and metallurgy departments of the original Wuhan University, Hunan University, Nanchang University, Guangxi University, etc., as well as the geology department of Sun Yat-sen University and the non-ferrous metal smelting and mineral processing specialized course of Beijing Institute of Mining. The institute now has four departments: Geological Exploration, Mining, Mineral Processing, and Non-ferrous Metals, as well as three four-year programs, namely, mining area development, non-ferrous metal smelting, and beneficiation of useful minerals. In addition, there are four two-year specialized courses in metal and non-metal mineral geology and exploration, mining technology, underground mineral exploitation, and metal mineral exploitation. The Central South Institute of Mining and Metallurgy began active preparations in March of this year and initially completed the task of building the school in October, enabling more than 1,600 students from all over the country to enter the school for further study.

Qingdao Institute of Technology was formed by merging the civil engineering department of the original Shandong University Institute of Technology and the civil engineering department and textile department of Shandong Institute of Technology. This is a multi-disciplinary institute of technology composed of civil engineering and textiles, with two departments: civil engineering and textile engineering; each department has undergraduate and specialized courses, and there are many specialized subjects. The above two departments have three undergraduate majors and four specialized courses, with 799 students and 76 teachers (excluding part-time teachers), and a total of 1,023 teachers, students, and staff.

(Xinhua News Agency) In order to accelerate the training of a large number of technical cadres and meet the large-scale economic construction next year, the Southwest Industrial Department has successively opened seventeen short-term technical professional schools for metallurgy, construction, coal mining, geological exploration, etc. A total of 10,200 students are participating in the study, and they will all learn a specialized skill in a short period of time to participate in the construction of the motherland. Three thousand of them are outstanding workers with elementary school education and long working years selected by various factories, two thousand are professional cadres in service, and the rest are students, unemployed workers, and unemployed intellectuals.

The Southwest Industrial Department attaches great importance to this work and has equipped strong cadres to lead the work of various professional schools. In addition to the director of the Enterprise Administration Bureau serving as the principal of each professional school, there is also a cadre at or above the level of the secretary of the CCP county committee serving as the vice-principal. In addition, in order to strengthen technical education and ensure the completion of teaching tasks, the Southwest Industrial Department has specially established a Technical Education Research Office. The Technical Education Research Office is composed of experienced university professors, experts, engineers, slightly experienced university graduates, and skilled workers with more than five years of work experience. The Technical Research Office has also established research groups according to the nature of the professional schools. The main task of the research group is to regularly go to various schools to check the problems existing in learning and the situation of linking theory with practice. In addition, the members of the Technical Research Office are also teachers in various professional schools. Therefore, in addition to regularly going to various schools to check the situation, they also often go to relevant factories and mines to experiment, absorb practical experience and new creations, and use them in teaching. The Technical Research Office also has a Russian translation section to translate various advanced Soviet theories and new creations, which not only solves the problem of teaching materials, but also timely guides the progress of professional school courses. In order to enable students to master advanced basic technologies in a short period of time, the Southwest Industrial Department is currently analyzing and studying more than 5,000 rationalization proposals put forward by various factories and mines based on advanced Soviet theories, compiling and printing various professional teaching materials for teaching. At the same time, various professional schools have adopted teaching methods that combine theory with practice. For example, the Electromechanical School and the Technical School have opened affiliated experimental factories specifically for students to experiment. The experimental factory of the Technical School alone has more than 500 machines.

In order to quickly start school and start classes, the Southwest Industrial Department adopted revolutionary methods to solve the problems of school buildings and experimental instruments. For example, the construction of houses mostly adopts rapid, simple, and economical methods, and some are repaired while school is in session. Machines and instruments are uniformly allocated by the Southwest Industrial Department from various enterprise administration bureaus and factories. Experimental specimens of geological schools are solved in a timely manner by borrowing, collecting, and purchasing.

    各地加速培养建设人材
    北京地质学院和中南矿冶学院等三校开学西南工业部开办十七个短期技术专业学校
    【本报讯】为大规模经济建设造就迫切需要的人材而成立的北京地质学院、长沙中南矿冶学院、青岛工学院，已先后于十一月初旬开学。
    北京地质学院是以原北京大学、清华大学、天津大学、唐山工学院的地质系为基础建立起来的。解放前，地质系被视为“冷门”系，人数极少。我国过去几十年培养出来的地质人材，共计不过八百多人。而且，他们所学的多偏重于地质理论，对于实际应用的课程，如资源勘测、地质钻探等则学得很少。因此，远远不能满足我国大规模工业建设的需要。北京地质学院今年新招学生有一千二百人，加上原有的学生，人数将等于过去几十年全国培养出来的地质人材的两倍。该院现在正筹建新校舍，计划明年再增收学生到三千五百人。
    北京地质学院依照长期培养与短期训练相结合的方针，设有四年制的本科和二年制的专修科。在本科里面分地质矿产勘探系、水文及工程地质系、地球物理探矿系三个系。各系学生学习热情极高，都希望迅速学会技术知识为祖国即将开始的大规模经济建设服务。加上该院所用教材都以苏联地质学系一九五二年编的教材为基础，能够密切联系实际，这就使我们能在很短的期间内培养出大批能胜任祖国建设任务的地质人材来。
    中南矿冶学院是由原武汉大学、湖南大学、南昌大学、广西大学等四校的矿冶系科及中山大学地质系、北京工矿学院有色金属冶炼与选矿专修科等合并成立的。该院现在设有地质探矿、采矿、选矿、有色金属等四个系，另设三个四年制的专业，即矿区开采、有色金属冶炼、有用矿物的精选。此外还有金属与非金属矿产地质及勘探、采矿技术、地下矿产的开采、金属矿物的开采等四个两年制的专修科。中南矿冶学院自今年三月起开始积极筹备，于十月间初步完成了建校任务，使来自各地的一千六百多名学生得以入学深造。
    青岛工学院是由原山东大学工学院的土木系和山东工学院的土木系及纺织系合并组成的。这是一个土木类和纺织类合成的多科性的工学院，共设土木工程和纺织工程两个学系；各系均设本科、专修科两科，并设有许多专业科目。以上两个学系共有三个本科专业和四个专修科，已有学员七百九十九人，教师七十六人（不包括兼课教师），全校师生员工共一千零二十三人。
    【新华社讯】为加速培养大量技术干部，迎接明年大规模经济建设，西南工业部已先后开办了冶金、建筑、采煤、地质勘察等十七个短期技术专业学校。参加学习的学员共一万零二百名，他们都将在短期内学会一种专门技术，参加祖国的建设。有三千名是经过各厂选拔具有初小文化程度和工龄较长的优秀工人，有二千名是在职的专业干部，其余为学生、失业工人和失业知识分子。
    西南工业部十分重视这一工作，配备了较强的干部来领导各专业学校的工作。各专业学校除由该业企业管理局的局长兼任校长外，还有一个中共县委书记一级以上的干部担任副校长。此外，为了加强技术教育并保证教学任务的完成，西南工业部特成立了技术教育研究室。技术教育研究室是由经验丰富的大学教授、专家、工程师、略有经验的大学毕业生和具有五年以上工龄的熟练工人组成。技术研究室下又根据专业学校的性质成立了研究组。研究组的主要任务是经常到各学校去检查学习中存在的问题和理论联系实际的情况。此外，技术研究室的成员同时又是各专业学校的教员，因此他们除经常到各校检查情况外，还经常到各有关厂矿实验，吸取实际经验和新的创造，用到教学中去。技术研究室内又专设有俄文翻译，翻译各种苏联先进理论和新的创造，这样既解决了教材问题，又及时指导了专业学校课程的进行。为了在短期内使学员掌握先进的基本技术，目前西南工业部正根据苏联先进理论和各厂矿提出的五千多件合理化建议加以分析研究，编印成各种专业教材进行教学。同时，各专业学校都采取了理论与实际相结合的教学方法。如机电学校和技工学校都开办了附属实验工厂，专门供学生实验，仅技工学校的实验工厂就有机器五百多台。
    为了迅速开学上课，西南工业部采用革命的办法来解决了校舍和实验仪器等问题。如房屋的修建多采取迅速、简单、经济的办法，有的就一边修理，一边开学。机器和仪器等由西南工业部从各企业管理局及各厂统一调拨。地质学校的实验标本等就采用了借、采、买三种办法来及时解决。
