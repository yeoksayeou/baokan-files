Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, November 3rd: The Secretariat of the World Federation of Democratic Youth has issued an appeal to the youth of the world on the occasion of the seventh anniversary of the Federation's founding on November 10th, stating:

    Seven years ago, the World Federation of Democratic Youth—an organization of young men and women of all races and nationalities with diverse political views and religious beliefs around the world—was founded. In these seven years, the World Federation of Democratic Youth has united seventy-five million young men and women in eighty-four countries under its banner. Its activities have demonstrated that it has expressed the great aspirations of the younger generation to defend peace and protect the rights of youth.

    This November 10th will be a day for young people to strengthen solidarity and engage in free discussions among those who are working for the peaceful resolution of international problems. This day will be a day for young people to prepare to participate in the World People's Peace Congress to be held in Vienna in December.

    For the youth of all countries who are actively preparing for the International Conference for the Defense of the Rights of Youth, November 10th will be a new stage. Young people must establish more preparatory committees, put forward their demands, unite their ranks more closely, and fight for the realization of these just demands.

    Let November 10, 1952—the seventh anniversary of the founding of the World Federation of Democratic Youth—be a day for uniting the forces of youth around the world, a day for the world's youth to defend peace, friendship, and the rights of the younger generation!

    世界民主青联纪念成立七周年
    发表告世界青年书
    【新华社三日讯】据塔斯社布达佩斯讯：十一月十日是世界民主青年联盟成立七周年纪念日，联盟书记处为此发表告世界青年书说：
    七年以前，世界民主青年联盟——一个全世界各种族各民族的具有各种不同政治见解与宗教信仰的青年的组织——成立了。在这七年中，世界民主青年联盟把八十四个国家的七千五百万男女青年团结在它的旗帜之下。它的活动证明它已经表达了青年一代的保卫和平和保卫青年权利的伟大愿望。
    今年十一月十日对于青年们说来将是一个加强团结，在为和平解决国际问题而努力的人们中间展开自由讨论的日子。这一天将是青年们准备参加将于十二月间在维也纳举行的世界人民和平大会的日子。
    对于积极筹备召开国际保卫青年权利大会的各国青年说来，十一月十日将是一个新的阶段。青年们一定要建立更多的筹备委员会，提出他们的要求，把他们的队伍团结得更加紧密，来为这些公正要求的实现而斗争。
    让一九五二年十一月十日——世界民主青年联盟成立七周年纪念日——成为团结全世界青年的力量的一天，让这一天成为世界青年保卫和平、友好及青年一代权利的日子！
