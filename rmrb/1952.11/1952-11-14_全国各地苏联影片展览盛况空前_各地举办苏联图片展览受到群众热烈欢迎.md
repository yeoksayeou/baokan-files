Xinhua News Agency, 13th. The "Soviet Film Exhibition" has opened in sixty-seven cities (with one additional location in East China), and the scale is unprecedented. From the 7th to the 9th, the audience in North China, Northeast China, and East China alone reached two million people. In the Northeast region, the exhibition cities screened a total of 480 shows per day. In Xiamen City, Fujian Province, the total number of registered viewers has exceeded the original plan by 183%. In Chengdu City, Sichuan Province, the seven cinemas have sold more than 800,000 tickets. In some areas, all cinema tickets have been pre-booked, and thousands of viewers still queue in front of the cinemas every day waiting for additional screenings. The film exhibition in remote areas is also very enthusiastic. "The Great Circus" was performed in Xining City, Qinghai Province, for three days, attracting more than 17,000 viewers. As of the 11th, 878 film projection teams in factories, mines, and rural areas across the country were showing Soviet films to the broad masses of workers and peasants.
    Xinhua News Agency, 13th. In order to enable people from all walks of life in our country to specifically understand the achievements of socialist and communist construction in the Soviet Union and the happy life of the Soviet people, major cities such as Shanghai, Chongqing, Hankou, Guangzhou, and Nanjing have held Soviet photo exhibitions. At each exhibition site, the flow of visitors was endless from morning till night. In Nanjing City, 100,000 people have visited the exhibition, and 90,000 people have registered for reservations. The Fuzhou Sino-Soviet Friendship Association held exhibitions simultaneously in thirteen venues, and the audience was still very crowded. Nearly 100,000 people visited in five days, accounting for about one-fifth of the city's population. In Chongqing City, despite continuous rainy days, enthusiastic people held umbrellas and lined up in front of the exhibition hall to wait. Housewives in Luomadian Street in the city specially organized mutual aid groups to take care of their children and take turns to visit. People of all ethnic minorities also love Soviet pictures. After the Zhaojue County of the Yi Autonomous Region in Xikang Province held an exhibition, the Yi people came in groups to visit.
    In order to let Soviet photos meet a wider range of people, in addition to holding fixed large-scale exhibitions, various places also adopted small-scale exhibitions, mobile exhibitions, and "photo corridors." In Shanghai, many factories, schools, streets, and even buses and trams were posted with pictures, so that the city exhibited more than 22,000 sets of Soviet pictures. Many grass-roots organizations of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association in Guangzhou City held small-scale exhibitions. Nanjing has twenty-nine photo exhibition groups, which exhibited in various units and suburbs. The Yunnan Provincial "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month" office sent two propaganda vehicles carrying a large number of Soviet photos to Chenggong, Jinning, Yiliang and other places for mobile exhibitions to farmers.
    The pictures of Soviet industrial and agricultural construction have greatly inspired and encouraged workers, peasants, and students in various places. In particular, the pictures depicting the construction project of the Lenin Volga-Don Canal have been widely praised. Students from the Southwest Water Conservancy College in Chongqing City wrote in the opinion book: "We have the beautiful Yangtze River and Yellow River. We want to turn them into China's Volga River and Don River and strive for the country's water conservancy cause to the end!" The pictures of Soviet collective farms aroused great interest among farmers in various places. Hu Bintang, an old farmer in Wuhan City who had been a farmhand for fifty years, stood in front of the pictures and listened to the commentator for three times before he was willing to leave. He said, "If I can live another ten years, I will definitely see China like the Soviet Union!" The Li Fengyi Model Mutual Aid Group in Xiaozhai Township, Jinning County, Yunnan Province, collectively visited the pictures of Soviet collective farms, and immediately held a discussion meeting after returning to the village to prepare to organize agricultural production cooperatives.
    After visiting the Soviet pictures, the broad masses of the people deepened their love for the happy life of the Soviet people. Huang Yimei, an old woman from a revolutionary soldier's family in Gulou District, Fuzhou City, has been participating in Sino-Soviet friendship propaganda activities every day since she saw the Soviet pictures. She has mobilized forty-one residents to join the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association within a few days. In Cangshan District of the city, an elderly person in his seventies ran to see the Soviet pictures every day. He said: "Under the leadership of Chairman Mao, we are already living a happy and free life. I didn't expect the Soviet people to live a better life than us. I must watch it a few more times so that I can go home and educate my children and grandchildren to study the Soviet Union hard. We must take the Soviet road."

    【新华社十三日讯】为了使我国各阶层群众具体地了解苏联社会主义和共产主义的建设成就和苏联人民的幸福生活，上海、重庆、汉口、广州、南京等各大城市都举办了苏联图片展览。在各个展览处，从早到晚，观众川流不息。南京市已经有十万人参观了展览会并有九万人登记预约。福州中苏友好协会在十三个场所同时举行展览，观众仍十分拥挤，五天内就有近十万人前往参观，约占全市人口五分之一。重庆市连日阴雨，热情的人们撑着雨伞在展览室的门前排队等候。该市骡马店街的家庭妇女特地组织互助组看管孩子，轮流去参观。各少数民族人民也热爱苏联图片，西康省彝族自治区昭觉县举办展览会后，彝族人民成群结队地赶来参观。
    为了使苏联图片和更广大的人民群众见面，各地除举办固定的大展览会外，还采用了小型展览、巡回展览及“图片走廊”等方式。在上海，很多工厂、学校、街道甚至公共汽车和电车内都张贴着图片，全市就这样展出了两万二千多套苏联图片。广州市的许多中苏友好协会的基层组织，都举行了小型展览会。南京有二十九个图片展览组，分别到各单位和郊区展出。云南省“中苏友好月”办公室派出两路宣传车，携带了大批苏联图片到呈贡、晋宁、宜良等地向农民作巡回展览。

    广大人民参观了苏联图片后，更加深了对苏联人民幸福生活的爱慕。福州市鼓楼区革命军人家属黄依妹老大娘，自从看过苏联图片以后，每天起早歇晚地参加中苏友好宣传活动，她在几天之内就动员了四十一个居民加入中苏友好协会。该市仓山区有
    一位七十多岁的老年人每天都跑来看苏联图片，他说：“我们在毛主席领导下已经过着幸福自由的生活，想不到苏联人民的生活比我们更好，我一定要多看几遍，好回家教育我的子孙努力学习苏联，我们要走苏联的路。”
