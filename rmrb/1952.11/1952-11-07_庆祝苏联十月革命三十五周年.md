    Celebrating the 35th Anniversary of the October Revolution in the Soviet Union
    Zhang Bojun, Member of the World Peace Council
    On the occasion of the 35th anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution in the Soviet Union, let us express our heartfelt gratitude and highest respect to the great Marshal Stalin, beloved by the people of the world; let us pay tribute to the great Soviet people who are victoriously building communism and their glorious great organizer, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union; let us pay tribute to the Soviet experts who have worked tirelessly in China for the past three years with selfless spirit, constantly providing selfless assistance to China's revolutionary and construction endeavors.
    The great victory of the October Revolution thirty-five years ago opened a huge gap in the international capitalist system, laying a victorious foundation for proletarian socialist revolution and national democratic revolution, thus beginning a fundamental transformation from the old capitalist world to the new socialist world. It not only liberated one-sixth of the earth's land, but especially liberated the hearts of the world's proletarians and all working people. The mutual echoing of class liberation struggles and national liberation movements has formed a peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union—a powerful and indestructible force for peace, and the friendly alliance between the Chinese and Soviet people is the core of the unity of the people of the world.
    The great victory of the Chinese People's Revolution and the brilliant achievements of the new China in the past three years are inseparable from the Soviet Union's unwavering assistance. Now the Soviet Union is advancing towards the construction of communism on the basis of socialist consolidation. The Soviet Union's today is our tomorrow. In the historical course of human social development, China and the Soviet Union are following the same path. Due to the existence of the advanced and powerful Soviet Union, our environment and conditions for nation-building are much more favorable. We need peace, we need construction. Since the founding of the new China, our people's construction cause has basically and successfully completed the work of restoration and transformation, and is now preparing to start large-scale economic construction. The Soviet Union has 35 years of rich experience in socialist construction. In order to welcome and ensure the victorious success of the upcoming large-scale economic, cultural, and national defense construction, in addition to consolidating and developing the fraternal friendly relations and all mutual assistance and cooperation between China and the Soviet Union, we must first learn from the Soviet Union's advanced science and technology and production construction experience.
    Based on my experience working in the Central Ministry of Communications, I deeply feel that the Soviet experts who have come to China have been helping our construction work wholeheartedly and to the best of their ability at all times and in all places. There are many facts that inspire us and make us admire them. As Marshal Stalin pointed out in his historically significant classic work "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR": "No capitalist country can give the people's democratic countries genuine help and technically sophisticated help like the Soviet Union. The problem is not only that this kind of help is extremely cheap and technically first-rate. The problem is primarily that the basis of this cooperation is a sincere desire to help each other and seek common economic upsurge. As a result, there has been a high speed of industrial development in these countries." Under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party of China, in order to undertake the great task of national construction and grasp the international situation conducive to democratic and peaceful construction, we Chinese people must further understand and learn from the Soviet Union.

    庆祝苏联十月革命三十五周年
    世界和平理事会理事  章伯钧
    伟大的苏联十月社会主义革命三十五周年纪念日到了，让我们向全世界人民共同爱戴的伟大的斯大林大元帅致衷心的感谢和崇高的敬意；让我们向正在胜利地建设共产主义的伟大的苏联人民及其光荣的伟大的组织者苏联共产党致敬；让我们向三年来在中国不辞劳苦，以忘我的精神帮助我国建设的苏联专家们致敬：他们对于中国革命事业和建设事业不断地给以大公无私的援助。
    由于三十五年前十月革命的伟大胜利，给国际资本主义体系打开一个巨大的缺口，为无产阶级社会主义革命和民族民主主义革命奠定了胜利的基础，从而开始了由资本主义旧世界进入社会主义新世界的根本转变。它不仅解放了地球上六分之一的土地，特别是解放了全世界无产者和一切劳动人民的心。阶级解放斗争和民族解放运动的互相呼应，形成了以苏联为首的和平民主阵营——强大的无坚不摧的和平力量，而中苏两国人民的友好同盟就是全世界人民团结的核心。
    中国人民革命的伟大胜利和新中国三年来的辉煌成就，是和苏联之始终不变地援助分不开的。现在苏联正在社会主义的巩固基础上向着共产主义的建设迈进。苏联的今天，就是我们的明天。在人类社会发展的历史途程上，中国和苏联是走的一条道路。由于先进的强大的苏联的存在，我们建国的环境和条件是比较优越的多了。我们需要和平，我们需要建设。新中国成立以来，我们的人民建设事业，已经基本上胜利地完成了恢复和改造工作，现正在准备开始大规模的经济建设。苏联具有三十五年社会主义建设的丰富经验，我们为了迎接并保证即将到来的大规模经济、文化和国防建设的胜利成功，除了巩固并发展中苏两国兄弟般的友好关系和一切的互助合作外，首先要学习苏联先进的科学技术生产建设的经验。
    依我在中央交通部工作的经验来说，我深深地感觉到来到中国的苏联专家们，对于我们的建设工作是随时随地、尽心尽力地帮助，有许许多多的事实令我们感奋，令我们敬佩。诚如斯大林大元帅在有历史性的国际意义的经典著作“苏联社会主义经济问题”中所指示的：“没有一个资本主义国家能像苏联那样给予各人民民主国家以真正的帮助和技术精湛的帮助。问题不仅在于这种帮助是极度便宜的，技术上是头等的。问题首先在于这种合作的基础，是互相帮助和求得共同经济高涨的真诚愿望。结果，在这些国家中便有了高速度的工业发展。”我们中国人民在毛主席和中国共产党领导之下，为要承担国家建设的大任务，掌握有利于民主和平建设的国际形势，我们就要更进一步地认识苏联，学习苏联。
