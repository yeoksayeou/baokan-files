Volunteer Army Heroes' Guarantee to the Motherland
——Reader Letters Summary

While the Second Delegation to Korea was conducting its慰問 (comfort) mission on the Korean front, many commanders and soldiers of the Volunteer Army wrote from the front lines in Korea to thank the people of the motherland and to guarantee that they would complete the tasks entrusted to them by the people of the motherland.

A commemorative bag was sent to the editorial department of this newspaper. This commemorative bag was part of the gifts from all the commanders and soldiers of a certain unit of the Volunteer Army to the慰問団 (comfort delegation). The bag contained several booklets such as "Heroes Fighting in Korea," "Introduction Cards of Meritorious Deeds," "List of Meritorious Personnel," and "Selected Works of Soldiers' Literature and Art," as well as a letter written to the people of the motherland by all the commanders and soldiers of the unit. The letter stated: Since entering Korea, our unit has eliminated a total of 31,782 enemy soldiers, captured 1,276 various firearms, 78 various artillery pieces, 27 tanks, and 87 vehicles, and destroyed or damaged 173 enemy aircraft and 130 tanks. In battle, we launched a widespread campaign to earn merit, and many heroes and meritorious individuals emerged, along with countless heroic deeds. Currently, 418 units and 8,807 comrades have been recognized for their merits. Among them are those you are familiar with: the eight brave men who bravely jumped off a cliff and refused to surrender; the Wang Yongzhang Hero Platoon, which destroyed seven enemy tanks and captured more than fifty enemies alive; Liu Guangzi, the "Second-Class Lone Hero" who captured sixty-three prisoners alive; Cai Jintong, the "Second-Class Hero Steel Warrior" who persisted in combat despite multiple serious injuries; and Yao Xianru, the "Second-Class Mine-Laying Hero," and others. Dear compatriots, our every victory and every meritorious deed is closely linked to your support and care. Without your support, there would be no victory for us. The motherland's large-scale economic construction is about to begin, so you can rest assured and produce. We guarantee to strike the enemy even harder and ensure the smooth progress of the motherland's construction.

All the comrades of a platoon of a certain unit of the Volunteer Army wrote in a letter entrusted to this newspaper to be forwarded to the慰問団 (comfort delegation): When the news of your arrival in Korea reached our unit, the soldiers were engaged in the fierce battle for Height 394.8 in Yaoshandong area northwest of Tieyuan. This added new strength to us and led to the rapid victory of the battle. In this battle, more than 8,000 enemies were eliminated, and 11 enemy aircraft were shot down or damaged. Our current task is to fight and study at the same time, so everyone especially welcomes the study notebooks you brought this time. The soldiers said: "Last year, the people of the motherland sent us anti-aircraft machine guns, and today they sent us study notebooks, which is really timely. We must work harder to study, master modern military technology more skillfully, and follow the instructions of the people of the motherland to severely strike the American invaders."

Sun Jiuxu, a cultural worker from a certain unit of the Volunteer Army, wrote: A few days before October 25th, I watched a Peking opera performance by Comrade Ye Sheng and others. The tremendous achievements of the motherland in culture and art over the past three years have increased my love for the motherland. Here, I express my determination: to strive to improve my professional level, enliven the cultural life on the battlefield, and enhance the fighting morale of the soldiers, so that they can fight more and better battles.

In dozens of letters from soldiers, the same guarantee was made: to respond to the care and love of the people of the motherland by safeguarding the happiness and safety of the people of the motherland.

    志愿军英雄们对祖国的保证
    ——读者来信综述
    当第二届赴朝慰问团正在朝鲜前线进行慰问的时候，许多志愿军指战员从朝鲜前线写信，向祖国人民致谢，并提出保证，一定完成祖国人民所付托的任务。
    一个纪念袋寄到本报编辑部。这种纪念袋是志愿军某部全体指战员送给慰问团的礼品内的一份。袋里装有“战斗在朝鲜的英雄们”、“功臣事迹介绍卡片”、“功臣榜”、“战士文艺作品选集”等几个小册子，还有该部全体指战员写给祖国人民的信。信中写道：入朝以来，我部共歼敌三万一千七百八十二人，缴获各种枪枝一千二百七十六枝，各种炮七十八门，坦克二十七辆，汽车八十七辆，毁伤敌机一百七十三架，坦克一百三十辆。在战斗中，我们开展了广泛的立功运动，出现了许多英雄功臣，出现了无数英勇事迹。目前已有四百一十八个单位和八千八百零七个同志立了功。其中你们所熟悉的有：英勇跳崖、宁死不屈的八勇士；摧毁敌人七辆坦克、生擒五十多个敌人的王永章英雄排；活捉六十三个俘虏的“二级孤胆英雄”刘光子；连受重伤仍坚持作战的“二级英雄钢铁战士”蔡金同；“二级起雷英雄”姚显儒等。亲爱的同胞们，我们的每一个胜利，每一个功臣事迹，都和你们的支援和关怀密切联系着。没有你们的支援，也不会有我们的胜利。祖国大规模的经济建设将要开始了，你们尽管安心地生产吧。我们保证更狠狠地打击敌人，保卫住祖国的建设顺利进行。
    志愿军某部一排全体同志，在托本报转给赴朝慰问团的信上写着：你们到达朝鲜的消息传到我部时，战士们正投入铁原西北药山洞地区三九四点八高地的激烈争夺战中。这给我们增添了新的力量，使战斗迅速胜利结束。在这次争夺战中，共歼敌八千余人，击落、击伤敌机十一架。我们目前的任务是一面战斗，一面学习，因此大家格外欢迎你们这次带来的学习本子。战士们说：“去年祖国人民给我们送来了高射机枪，今天又送来了学习本，真是适合时宜。我们要加劲学习，更熟练地掌握现代化军事技术，遵照祖国人民的嘱托，狠狠打击美国侵略者。”
    志愿军某部文化工作者孙九序来信说：十月二十五日前几天，我看了一场叶盛兰等同志的京剧演出。祖国三年来在文化艺术方面的巨大成就，增加了我对祖国的热爱。我在这里表示决心：努力提高业务水平，活跃战地文化生活，提高战士们的战斗情绪，使他们打更多、更漂亮的仗。
    数十封战士来信中，都提出了同样的保证：要以保卫住祖国人民的幸福和安全，来回答祖国人民的关怀和热爱。
