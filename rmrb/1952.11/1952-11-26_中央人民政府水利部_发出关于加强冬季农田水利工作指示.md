The Central People's Government Ministry of Water Resources recently issued "Instructions on Strengthening Winter Farmland Water Conservancy Work." The instructions first pointed out: The autumn harvest and autumn planting have ended in various regions. For the southern provinces, constructing farmland water conservancy projects is currently the most important task in agricultural production and construction. In the northern provinces, winter irrigation should also be actively carried out. All regions across the country need to launch various preparatory tasks for water conservancy construction to lay a good foundation for drought prevention and resistance next year. To this end, the instructions require all regions to strengthen leadership in winter farmland water conservancy work and do the following:

First, provinces south of the Yangtze River should widely mobilize farmers to do a good job in winter repairs, concentrate all efforts, and universally construct ponds, dams, and other projects, striving to store and use water next spring. All regions must first repair and improve existing water conservancy projects to increase water storage capacity and strengthen drought resistance. Regions with fewer original farmland water conservancy projects should organize farmers to build new projects to gradually get rid of the threat of drought. During the construction process, widespread publicity must be carried out among farmers. Water conservancy committees or project committees at the county, district, and township levels should conscientiously organize manpower and materials to repair all projects that need to be repaired. Water conservancy departments at all levels should send a certain number of technical cadres to go deep into construction sites, conduct inspections, guide and focus on mastering construction, summarize and promote advanced experiences in construction projects, and improve farmers' technical level. Upon completion, beneficiary masses should be organized to inspect and accept the projects, and water use and maintenance covenants should be discussed and established, with special personnel selected to be responsible for management. Large-scale irrigation and drainage projects that have been reviewed and approved for commencement in various regions should be prepared for commencement immediately. The agricultural canals, branch canals, and land to be leveled for irrigation and drainage projects should be started by mobilizing farmers at the same time so that farmland can benefit immediately after the project is completed. In the project, the consumption quota system should be implemented, practicing thrift and reducing waste; attention should be paid to on-site safety and sanitation facilities; at the same time, political education of migrant workers should be strengthened, and labor competitions should be launched to ensure the project is completed on schedule.

Second, spring rain is scarce in the northern provinces, and winter irrigation is very important. In recent years, farmers in the north have developed the habit of winter irrigation, and the area of ​​winter irrigation has been increasing. Experience has also proven that winter irrigation can prevent spring drought, reduce pests, and loosen the soil after thawing, which helps to increase wheat production. This autumn, some areas in the north have insufficient rainfall, and it is even more necessary to prevent spring drought next year. Therefore, this winter, all existing irrigation equipment such as channels and wells must be fully utilized to expand the winter irrigation area as much as possible. Areas with existing winter irrigation habits should actively promote advanced irrigation experience, strictly control the amount of water, extend the canal lines or add branch canals, and require all irrigable land to be winter-irrigated once. In areas without winter irrigation habits, cadres and model workers should be mobilized to promote the benefits of winter irrigation, break the conservative thinking among farmers, and focus on organizing backbones to take the lead in demonstrations, gain experience, and promote it next year. In areas with waterwheels and wells, neighbors should be further united, helping each other to exchange labor, and organizing joint irrigation. Water wells that have not yet been utilized should be equipped with water lifting tools in time, and strive to exert irrigation efficiency in winter irrigation. In order to expand the source of spring irrigation next year, areas with conditions should focus on promoting the method of "raising ice and storing ice" in winter; and in early spring, attention should be paid to promoting the irrigation method of "digging ice grooves and building ice weirs."

Third, all regions should also do a good job in preparing for farmland water conservancy next year. In order to make the plan for farmland water conservancy projects next year more practical, all regions should conduct general surveys and investigations and submit them to mass meetings for research and revision. At the same time, water conservancy training classes should be organized to train a group of district and township cadres and peasant activists with general irrigation knowledge. Rural winter schools, mass meetings, and symposiums should also be used to publicize the benefits of irrigation, exchange irrigation experience among the masses, and impart water conservancy technology. Large irrigation systems should take advantage of the winter slack season to convene meetings of beneficiary representatives to rectify the irrigation system and study how to improve irrigation efficiency. The production of waterwheels must complete the production tasks on schedule and improve product quality.

### 中央人民政府水利部  发出关于加强冬季农田水利工作指示

    中央人民政府水利部
    发出关于加强冬季农田水利工作指示
    中央人民政府水利部最近发出“关于加强冬季农田水利工作的指示”。指示首先指出：各地秋收秋种已经结束，南方各省，兴修农田水利工程已是农业生产建设上当前的首要工作；北方各省，也应积极冬浇。全国各地都需展开兴修水利的各项准备工作，以为明年的防旱抗旱工作打好基础。为此，指示要求各地必须加强领导冬季的农田水利工作，作好以下几项工作：
    第一、长江以南各省，应广泛发动农民作好冬修工作，集中一切力量，普遍兴修塘坝等工程，争取明春能蓄水、用水。各地首先必须把旧有的水利工程整修改善好，增大蓄水量，加强抗旱能力。原来农田水利工程较少的地区，应组织农民兴修新的工程，以求逐步摆脱干旱威胁。兴修过程中，必须向农民广泛宣传。县、区、乡各级水利委员会或工程委员会都要认真组织人力物力，把该修的工程都修好。各级水利部门，应抽派一定的技术干部，深入工地，巡回检查，指导并重点掌握施工，总结和推广兴修工程中的先进经验，提高农民的技术水平。完工时应组织受益群众检查验收，并议订使水养护公约，选出专人负责管理。各地已经审查批准开工的大型灌溉排水工程，应即筹备开工。灌溉排水工程所要开挖的农渠毛渠和要平整的土地，都要发动农民同时动工，以便工程完成后农田能立即受益。工程中要执行消费定额制度，厉行节约，减少浪费；注意工地安全和卫生设施；同时要加强民工的政治教育，发动劳动竞赛，以保证工程如期完成。
    第二、北方各省春雨稀少，冬浇很重要。近几年来，北方农民已有冬浇习惯，冬浇面积不断增加。而经验也证明了冬季灌溉能防止春旱，减轻虫害，并使农田在解冻后土壤疏松，有助于小麦产量的提高。今秋北方有些地区雨水不足，更需预防明年春旱。因此今冬必须充分利用现有渠道、水井等一切灌溉设备，尽量扩大冬浇面积。已有冬浇习惯地区，积极推广先进灌溉经验，严格掌握水量，延长渠线或增开支渠，要求能灌溉的土地都冬浇一遍。没有冬浇习惯的地区，要发动干部、劳动模范宣传冬浇好处，打破农民中的保守思想，重点组织骨干带头示范，取得经验，以便明年推广。有水车、水井的地区，应进一步联合地邻，互助换工，组织伙浇。还没有利用的水井，应及时添置提水工具，争取冬浇中能发挥灌溉效能。为了扩大明年春浇水源，有条件的地区在冬季应着重推广“养冰蓄冰”的办法；春初并注意推行“打冰槽、垒冰堰”的灌溉方法。
    第三、各地还要做好明年农田水利的准备工作。为使明年农田水利工程的计划更切实际，各地应普遍进行勘测调查，并交群众会议研究修正。同时要办好水利训练班，培养出一批有一般灌溉常识的区乡干部和农民积极分子。也要利用农村冬学和召开群众大会、座谈会，宣传灌溉效益，交流群众中的灌溉经验，传授水利技术。大的灌溉系统应趁冬闲召开受益户代表会议，整顿灌溉系统，研究提高灌溉效力。水车生产工作，必须按期完成生产任务，提高产品质量。    （新华社）
