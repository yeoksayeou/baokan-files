    The China People's Anti-American and Aid-Korea General Association hosted a banquet on the evening of the 12th in Beijing for all members of the Xiangyu Opera Troupe, who came to Beijing to participate in the First National Opera Performance and Observation Conference.

    Among those attending the banquet were Luo Longji, Minister of the Propaganda Department of the China People's Anti-American and Aid-Korea General Association; Xu Baoju, Minister of the Organization Department; Liu Guanyi, Secretary-General; Wu Maosun, Deputy Secretary-General; and other responsible personnel from various departments and offices. Invited to the banquet, in addition to Chang Xiangyu and all members of the Xiangyu Opera Troupe, was Zhang Jichun, Deputy Minister of the Culture Department of the Northwest Military and Political Committee.

    At the meeting, Liu Guanyi, on behalf of the China People's Anti-American and Aid-Korea General Association, expressed gratitude to the Xiangyu Opera Troupe for their patriotic act of donating a fighter plane with the proceeds from their performances during the patriotic donation movement, despite their hard work and travels to various places. He also congratulated the troupe on their remarkable achievements in reforming Henan Opera. In her reply, Chang Xiangyu said that the reason the Xiangyu Opera Troupe was able to complete this glorious task was due to the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the support of the broad masses of the people, the wise call of the China People's Anti-American and Aid-Korea General Association, and the assistance of anti-American and aid-Korea sub-associations in various regions. She stated that all members of the Xiangyu Opera Troupe will continue to work hard to serve the cause of resisting America, aiding Korea, and building a new China.
