    Letter Summary

    Should Pay Attention to Pre-installing Telephone Conduits When Designing Buildings
    Editor's Note: Reader Li Shuming's opinion is correct. The Ministry of Building Engineering of the Central People's Government has decided to notify relevant design units to pay attention to preventing and correcting this kind of inconsiderate design that leads to waste.
    Construction is underway throughout the motherland. In many buildings constructed in Beijing, telephone conduits are generally pre-installed. However, some building designs are inconsiderate and do not include pre-installed telephone conduits; after completion, when telephones need to be installed, very long surface wires have to be run around the building, with many nails hammered in, and many holes drilled in the doors and windows. This not only affects the appearance of the building, but also wastes manpower and materials. It is hoped that attention will be paid to this issue in advance in future construction projects across the country.

    Suggestion: Schools Should Collect Old Badges When Issuing New Ones
    Recently, many schools are re-issuing new badges due to departmental adjustments or other reasons. In the past, when many schools re-issued new badges, they did not properly handle the old badges, allowing holders to put them aside or discard them. This not only makes the copper of the old badges unusable, but also makes it easy for bad elements to pick them up and swindle and deceive, disrupting public security. Therefore, I suggest that all schools must collect the invalid old badges when issuing new school badges in the future. Nanjing Institute of Technology Shi Shiwen
    Editor's Note: Comrade Shi Shiwen's letter was forwarded by the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government. The Ministry of Education believes that this opinion is correct and hopes that all schools will pay attention to it.
    The Erroneous Behavior of Selling Internal Documents as Waste Paper Should Be Corrected Immediately
    I have found several times that some students, after participating in the land reform, sell some booklets printed with the words "Internal Documents" as waste paper. If these internal documents fall into the hands of bad elements, it is very likely to cause things that are unfavorable to the country and the people. Therefore, I hope you will remind everyone to pay attention and correct this behavior of not paying attention to keeping state secrets.

    Propaganda Departments in Various Places Should Provide Blackboards with Popular Propaganda Materials in a Timely Manner
    I
    At present, many blackboards and "native broadcasts" in rural areas are affecting their propaganda role due to the lack of short and popular propaganda materials. Some blackboards copied entire long articles from newspapers, which the masses do not like to read. When "native broadcasts" use long articles from newspapers to publicize issues, the broadcasters run out of breath and sometimes make mistakes due to inappropriate pauses. It is hoped that popular newspapers in various places will pay attention to this issue and provide more popular and short propaganda materials for rural blackboards and "native broadcasts." Henan Province Beiwudu Cultural Center Zhu Zhi
    II
    Xiwang Village and Dama Village in the suburbs of Shijiazhuang City attach great importance to blackboard newspaper work. They often use blackboard newspapers to publicize current affairs and various central tasks in a timely manner, which is very good. However, due to the lack of popular language, people with little literacy cannot easily understand them, and people with more literacy do not have free time to stand there and read the lengthy articles.
    In order to give full play to the propaganda effect of blackboard newspapers, blackboard newspapers should publish short, popular, and diversified propaganda materials suitable for the tastes of farmers. It is recommended that propaganda departments and local newspapers in various places pay attention to this issue, provide the above materials in a timely manner, and strengthen the leadership of rural blackboard newspapers.

    When Organs Below the County Level Send Documents to Other Provinces,
    They Should Specify the Province or Administrative Region to Which They Belong
    When organs of some county people's governments issue official documents, they do not specify the province or administrative region to which the county belongs. After the receiving organ processes them and needs to reply or return the original documents, it takes a lot of time to find out the province or administrative region to which they belong; some counties are newly established and cannot be found at all. This not only wastes a lot of time for the receiving organ, but also easily leads to errors in delivery. It is recommended that you remind everyone that in the future, when organs below the county level in various places send documents to other provinces, they must specify the province or administrative region to which they belong.

    Pay Attention to Educating the Masses Not to Cross the Railway
    Some peasant brothers, because they do not understand the danger of trains, often graze cattle near the railway or drive cattle carts or lead livestock to rush across the crossings. This can easily cause the train to stop midway or other tragic accidents, causing irreparable losses to the country and the people. For example, on October 16, the 713th train between Luoyang and Shanzhou was approaching a certain place between Zhangmao and Jiaokou, and Zhao Chuangyun, a farmer from Moxiao Township, led two yellow cattle across the center of the crossing. The train could not stop in time, resulting in the death of one of the yellow cattle; the train also derailed and overturned, injuring several people on board, and disrupting traffic for a long time.
    In order to avoid similar incidents from happening, I suggest that cadres in areas near the railway vigorously publicize and explain to the masses. Let the masses understand that trains travel very fast and often cannot stop immediately. Therefore, do not covet convenience and walk along dangerous areas such as bridges, tunnels, large curves, and downhill slopes on the line. When crossing the railway, you must pay attention: if you see a train coming, do not risk rushing across the road. Especially those who drive cattle carts or lead livestock must wait for the train to pass before crossing. Because the hooves of livestock are often stuck in the track crevices and cannot be pulled out easily, which can easily lead to danger.

    来信摘要
    设计建筑物时应注意预置电话暗线
    编者按：读者李书鸣的意见是正确的。中央人民政府建筑工程部决定通知各有关设计单位，注意防止和纠正这种设计时考虑不周以致造成浪费现象的情况。
    祖国各地都在进行建筑。在北京建筑的许多大楼中，一般都预置电话暗线。但个别的大楼设计时考虑不周，没有预置电话暗线；完工后需要安装电话，只得绕楼拉了很长皮线，钉了许多钉子，并在门窗上钻了许多窟窿。这不但影响建筑物的美观，而且也是人力、物力的浪费。希望今后各地进行建筑时预先注意这个问题。

    建议各学校发新证章时把旧证章收回
    最近很多学校因院系调整或其它原因，都要改发新证章。以往不少学校改发新证章时，对旧证章不作适当处理，任凭持有人搁置或丢弃。这不但使旧证章的铜不能利用，并且还容易被坏分子拾去招摇撞骗，扰乱治安。因此，我建议今后各校发新校徽时一定把作废的旧校徽收回。南京工学院    史世文编者按：史世文同志的来信是中央人民政府教育部转来的。教育部认为这个意见是正确的，希望各学校注意。
    应立即纠正把内部文件当废纸出卖的错误行为
    我曾经好几次发现有些学生参加土地改革后，把带回来的一些印有“内部文件”字样的小册子当作废纸出卖。这些内部文件，如果落到坏分子的手里，很可能发生对国家、对人民不利的事情。因此，我希望你们提起大家注意，纠正这种不重视保守国家机密的行为。

    各地宣传部门应及时供给黑板报以通俗宣传材料
    一
    目前很多农村中的黑板报和“土广播”，都因缺乏简短通俗的宣传材料而影响了它们的宣传作用。有些黑板报把报纸上整套长篇的材料抄了上去，群众都不爱看。“土广播”用报纸上长篇材料宣传问题时，广播的人念得上气不接下气，有时停顿得不适当还弄错了原意。希望各地通俗报纸注意这个问题，多多供给农村黑板报和“土广播”通俗简短的宣传材料。    河南省北舞渡文化馆  朱帜
    二
    石家庄市郊的西王村和大马村，对黑板报工作很重视。他们经常利用黑板报及时地作时事和各项中心工作的宣传，这是很好的。但是由于文字不通俗，认字少的不容易看懂，认字较多的人，也没有空闲时间站在那里看那长篇大论。
    为了充分发挥黑板报的宣传效果，黑板报应该刊载适合农民口味的简短通俗而形式多样化的宣传材料。建议各地宣传部门和地方报纸注意这个问题，适时地供给上述材料，并加强对乡村黑板报的领导工作。    韩风
    县以下机关往外省发文时
    应该写明其所属省或行署区
    某些县人民政府的机关发出公文时，不写明该县所属省或行署区，收文机关处理后要答复或退还原件，要费很多时间找明所属省或行署区；有的县是新近设立的，根本无法查到。这样不但耽误收文机关很多时间，并且投递时也容易发生错误。建议你们提醒大家，以后各地县以下机关发文往外省时，务须写明所属省或行署区。

    注意教育群众不要穿越铁路
    有些农民弟兄因为不了解火车的危险性，常在铁路附近放牛或者驶牛车、牵牲口抢越道口。这样就很容易造成列车中途停车或者其他惨痛事故，给国家人民造成无法挽救的损失。如十月十六日，洛阳陕州间七一三次列车在行抵张矛交口间某处，有模小乡农民赵创运牵黄牛两头横穿道心。列车停车不及，致将黄牛轧死一头；列车也离线颠覆，车上人员数人受伤，并使交通中断很久。
    为了避免类似事件的发生，我建议铁路附近地区的干部大力向群众进行宣传解释。使群众了解：火车行驶很快，往往不能马上停车。因此，千万不要贪图便利，顺着线路上的桥梁、山洞、大弯道、下坡等危险地带走路。穿行铁路时必须注意：如见有火车开来，千万不要冒险抢道。尤其是驾牛马车、牵牲口的人，必须等火车过去再走。因为牲口蹄子往往卡在道缝中拔不出来，容易出危险。
