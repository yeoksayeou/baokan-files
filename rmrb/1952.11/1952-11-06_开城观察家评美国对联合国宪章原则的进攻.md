(Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, November 5) Washington has used the fifteen months of armistice negotiations to launch a vicious attack on the principles of the United Nations Charter, which obstruct the United States from implementing its plan to aggress the world. This is the conclusion of observers here. They pointed out that the American negotiators launched a triple attack on territorial sovereignty, sovereignty, and human rights, creating a shameful precedent for attempting to conquer the world. This attack failed, and the American representatives had to turn to the United Nations General Assembly to continue their attack, where they attempted to use their voting machine to pass absurd propositions that they could not pass at the negotiating table.

The purpose of this triple attack was to force the Korean and Chinese side to implement an armistice based on surrender conditions, which would allow the U.S. side to violate North Korea's territorial sovereignty, interfere in Korean internal affairs, and use Korean and Chinese prisoners of war as cannon fodder in America's war to conquer the world.

This attack began with the United States, using "military superiority" as a pretext, insisting on seizing 12,000 square kilometers of territory in North Korea. They demanded the seizure of this territory based on their "sea and air superiority." However, the United Nations forces suffered 250,000 casualties in the failed summer and autumn offensives last year, and this heavy loss taught the American generals that America's concept of force no longer works in Asia.

The American negotiators then launched an attack on sovereignty. They demanded interference in Korean internal affairs - conducting aerial reconnaissance and photographic reconnaissance, demanding the dispatch of military personnel to move freely and inspect in the rear of Korea, and demanding restrictions on the construction of Korean airport facilities. The United States put forward this request based on force. American representative Tenney openly declared that the American Air Force had already interfered in internal affairs with its indiscriminate bombing. However, the Korean and Chinese representatives firmly opposed interference in internal affairs, so this unreasonable demand had to be withdrawn five months later.

The final attack was on the repatriation rights of prisoners of war guaranteed by the Geneva Conventions and international practice. For another five months, the American representatives put forward the demand to detain prisoners of war as the price of an armistice. However, their plan failed again; so they interrupted the negotiations, forcing the United Nations General Assembly to support this political blackmail while continuing the war. From the wording of the 63 clauses of the draft Korean armistice agreement, which is now only awaiting signature, it can be seen that the U.S. side's triple attack has completely failed. There is not a single word in the draft armistice agreement about so-called "voluntary repatriation" and "non-forcible repatriation." But Acheson now wants the United Nations General Assembly to support the so-called "non-forcible repatriation" proposal put forward by the United States.

Despite Acheson's talk about avoiding the use of force against prisoners of war, "voluntary repatriation" actually relies on force. Official U.S. reports have fully demonstrated that they used force to compel the "screening" of prisoners of war. When prisoners of war were unwilling to be "screened," the U.S. military suppressed them by force; when prisoners of war opposed non-repatriation and the method of never letting them go home to reunite with their families, the U.S. military massacred them by force. The bloody massacres that have occurred in U.S. prisoner-of-war camps for the past ten months have clearly demonstrated to the world that the United States has used the most brutal violence to create the nonsense of so-called "voluntary repatriation."

The true meaning of "voluntary repatriation" can be easily seen in the American-hyped conspiracy of using "Asians to fight Asians." As everyone knows, the United States is facing a shortage of manpower in carrying out its world aggression. To remedy this weakness, they want to use prisoners of war to kill each other, and use prisoners of war to carry out subversion in other countries. The American representatives sent to Panmunjom have frankly admitted that if all prisoners of war are repatriated uniformly, it will give the side holding fewer prisoners of war a "military advantage."

If the U.S. side's so-called "voluntary repatriation" method is approved, it means that terror and violence will be inflicted on prisoners of war from various countries, forcing them to betray their motherland for the sake of the United States' conspiracy to dominate the world. Now Acheson is asking other countries in the United Nations General Assembly to endorse the bloody crimes committed by the United States in the name of "voluntary repatriation," but no country with self-respect will endorse this evil proposition. It is clear that what the United States cannot get on the battlefield and at the negotiating table in Panmunjom, the United States cannot get with its voting machine in the United Nations General Assembly. But those who support the bloody proposal of the United States to continue the Korean War and oppose peace, since they shamelessly declare that they are running dogs of American imperialism, they must bear the most serious responsibility, together with the United States, for the situation caused by the American conspiracy to expand the war.

### 开城观察家评美国对联合国宪章原则的进攻

    开城观察家评美国对联合国宪章原则的进攻
    【新华社开城五日电】华盛顿利用历时十五个月的停战谈判，对妨碍美国实行侵略世界计划的联合国宪章原则发动了恶毒的进攻。这是此间观察家们的结论。他们指出，美国谈判代表对领土主权、主权和人权发动了三重的进攻，创造了企图征服世界的可耻先例。这种进攻失败了，美国代表不得不转而在联合国大会上进行攻击，他们企图在会上利用他们的表决机器通过他们在谈判桌上通不过的荒谬主张。
    这个三重进攻的目的，是要强制朝中方面实行以投降条件为基础的停战，这些条件允许美方侵犯北朝鲜的领土主权、干涉朝鲜内政和利用朝中战俘在美国征服世界的战争中充当炮灰。
    这种进攻开始于美国以“军事优势”为藉口坚持要求割取北朝鲜一万二千平方公里的领土。他们要求割取这些领土的根据是他们的“海空优势”。但是联合国军在去年失败的夏季攻势和秋季攻势中伤亡二十五万人，这一惨重损失教训了美国将军们：美国的武力观念已在亚洲行不通了。
    美国的谈判代表们于是对主权发动进攻。他们要求干涉朝鲜内政——进行空中侦察和摄影侦察，要求派遣军事人员到朝鲜的后方自由行动和视察，并要求限制朝鲜机场设备的修建。美国提出这种要求的根据，又是武力。美国代表滕纳公然宣称，美国空军已经用它的滥炸干涉了内政。但是朝中代表坚定反对干涉内政，于是这种不合理的要求不得不在五个月后撤消。
    最后的进攻是侵犯日内瓦公约与国际惯例所保证的战俘的遣返权利。又有五个月之久，美国代表提出了扣留战俘的要求，作为停战的代价。但是，他们的计划又失败了；于是他们就把谈判中断，迫使联合国大会支持这种政治上的讹诈行为，同时继续进行战争。从目前只等签字的朝鲜停战协定草案的六十三款规定的措辞上，可以看出美方所进行的这三重进攻已经完全破产。在停战协定草案上没有片言只字讲到所谓“自愿遣返”和“不得强迫遣返”。但是艾奇逊现在却要联合国大会支持美国所提的所谓“不得强迫遣返”的提案。
    尽管艾奇逊高谈对战俘应该避免使用武力，但是“自愿遣返”实际上正是依靠武力。美方的正式报道已经充分证明他们使用武力强迫“甄别”战俘。当战俘们不愿被“甄别”时，美国军队就用武力镇压他们；当战俘们反对不得遣返以及永远不让他们回家再与家人团聚的办法时，美国军队就用武力屠杀他们。今年十个月来在美方战俘营中发生的血腥屠杀，已经明确地向全世界证明：美国为了制造所谓“自愿遣返”的胡说，竟然使用最残酷的暴力。
    在美国大吹大擂的所谓用“亚洲人打亚洲人”的阴谋里，不难看出“自愿遣返”的真正意义。大家知道，美国在进行世界侵略时遇到人力缺乏的问题。为了补救这个弱点，他们想利用战俘去和本国人自相残杀，利用战俘对其他国家进行颠覆活动。美国派往板门店的代表已经坦白地承认：假若将全部战俘一律遣返，将使所拘战俘比较少的一方占了“军事上的便宜”。
    假若赞成美方的所谓“自愿遣返”的办法，那就是说要对各国的战俘施行恐怖与暴力，迫使他们为了美国统治世界的阴谋而背叛祖国。现在艾奇逊要求其他国家在联合国大会里赞成美国以“自愿遣返”的名义所干的血腥罪行，但是凡有自尊心的国家决不会附和这个罪恶的主张。很明显，凡是美国在战场上和板门店的谈判桌上得不到的东西，美国在联合国大会中的投票机器也不能得到。但是那些支持美国提出的继续朝鲜战争、反对和平的血腥提案的人，既然毫不知耻地表示他们是美帝国主义的走狗，他们就必须和美国一道，对美国扩大战争的阴谋所造成的局势担负最严重的责任。
