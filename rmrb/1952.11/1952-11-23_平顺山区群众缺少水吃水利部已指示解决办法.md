    People in Mountainous Areas of Pingshun Lack Water; Ministry of Water Resources Has Instructed on Solutions
    Editor: Not long ago, I went to Pingshun County for work. The people of this county have a common and urgent request—they hope the government will help them solve the difficulty of lacking drinking water that they have faced for many years. This county is a mountainous area in the Taihang Mountains. Except for some villages along the Zhang River in the Fourth and Fifth Districts that have river water to drink, the rest of the area has mountains and gullies but no water. The people have always relied on dry wells (storing rainwater inside) and reservoirs. This year, due to drought and lack of rain, no water has been stored. Nearly 50,000 people are now experiencing a drinking water panic (the county's population is 110,000); if this continues until next spring, 80 percent of the villages in the county will have no water to drink. The leaders of the county and the masses have already reported this issue to higher authorities and also raised it with the old revolutionary base area visiting delegation, but there has been no action so far. This is a major issue concerning the lives of the people, and we hope it will be disclosed in the newspaper to attract the attention of relevant leading organs.

    Editor's Note: After receiving the letter from Comrade Zhang Jiucheng, we contacted the Ministry of Water Resources. According to the Ministry's reply: the Shanxi Provincial Water Resources Bureau has been notified to send personnel to conduct surveys in the mountainous areas of Pingshun, assist the local government in widely mobilizing the masses to dig dry wells, and select suitable locations to build small reservoirs and storage ponds to solve the people's drinking water problem. Regarding the issue of drilling wells to utilize groundwater, we have consulted with the Ministry of Geology to send personnel to assist in solving the problem together.

    平顺山区群众缺少水吃水利部已指示解决办法
    编辑同志：不久前我因工作到了平顺县。该县群众有个共同的急迫要求——希望政府帮助他们解决多年来缺水吃的困难。该县系太行山的一个山区。全县除四区、五区一部分沿漳河的村庄有河水吃外，其余地区都是有山有沟没有水，群众一向是依靠旱井（把雨水贮藏进去）和蓄水池。今年因天旱缺雨，没有贮下水，现已有近五万人口感到吃水恐慌（全县人口十一万）；如到明春，全县即有百分之八十的村没水吃。这个问题该县领导上和群众早已向上级反映过，也曾向老区访问团提出过，到现在仍然不见动静。这是有关群众生活的大问题，希在报纸上披露，以便引起有关领导机关的重视。

    编者按：我们接读者张久成同志来信后，即与中央水利部取得联系。据该部复函称：已通知山西省水利局即派员到平顺一带山区进行察勘，协助地方政府广泛发动群众开挖旱井，并选择适宜地点修建小型水库及蓄水池塘，以解决群众吃水问题。关于凿井利用地下水问题，已商请中央地质部派员会同前往协助解决。
