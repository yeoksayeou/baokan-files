    Hoping Cartoonists Create More Cartoons Reflecting New Things
    Cartoons play a significant role in propaganda work because they are a form of propaganda loved by the masses.
    Recently, many of the cartoons published in the People's Daily have been very well received by readers. For example, Wei Qimei's "Dragon King Transferred to be God of Fire," "The Workers' Words"; Su Guang's birds and scarecrow; Fang Cheng's "New Guests on the New Route," and so on. Many comrades said after seeing these pictures, "Great! It really solves the problem!" Why do readers love them so much? I think the main reason is that these authors, with various expressive methods, reflect the essence of new things through vivid things in life. Therefore, people feel very kind, fresh, and humorous after seeing them; people do not feel any formalism or conceptualization at all; thus, the impression and education given to people are profound.
    We welcome cartoonists to create more such pictures.
    In addition, we feel that there are too few cartoons published in newspapers currently. Taking Shanghai newspapers as an example, it has been rare to see cartoons for several months. It is right for cartoonists to have a serious creative attitude, but they should not be so "serious" that they stop drawing. They should learn while drawing! They cannot wait to "succeed" before drawing, because the times require us to draw more!

    希望漫画家多创作反映新事物的漫画
    漫画在宣传工作上是起着重大作用的，因为它是群众所热爱的宣传形式。
    近来人民日报所登载的漫画中，有好多作品是非常受读者们欢迎的。如：韦启美画的“龙王调差做火神”、“工人的话”；苏光画的鸟儿和草人；方成画的“新路线上的新客人”等等。许多同志看了这些画之后都说“真好！真解决问题！”为什么读者这么热爱呢？我想：这主要的是因为这些作者同志以多种多样的表现方法，通过了生活中的生动事物，反映了新事物的本质。因此，使人看了后感到非常亲切、新鲜、有风趣；使人一点也感觉不到公式化、概念化；从而给人的印象、给人的教育是深刻的。
    我们欢迎漫画家们更多地创造像这样的画。
    另外，我们觉得目前报纸上发表的漫画太少了。就拿上海的报纸为例吧，几个月来就很少见到漫画。漫画家们创作态度严肃是应当的，但也不应当“严肃”到不画了。应当是一边画一边学吧！不能等待学“成”了再画，因为时代需要我们多画啊！
