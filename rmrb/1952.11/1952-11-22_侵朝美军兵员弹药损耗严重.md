Xinhua News Agency, Washington, November 21st: Due to the heavy losses of U.S. troops on the Korean front, the U.S. Department of Defense has stipulated that the training of new recruits in the U.S. Army, Navy, and Air Force will continue as usual during the Christmas and New Year holidays. The U.S. Department of Defense explained that because the need for rotation is urgent, the training of new recruits cannot be allowed to stop for ten days or two weeks, so basic training will continue during the holidays.

Xinhua News Agency, November 20th: In the war of aggression against Korea, American imperialism has suffered not only heavy losses in manpower but also unprecedentedly vast consumption of materials. According to the Associated Press, the U.S. Department of Defense released on the 10th comparative figures for the ammunition consumption of the U.S. invading forces during the two years from the start of the war of aggression against Korea in June 1950 to June 30, 1952. The U.S. Department of Defense announced that the ammunition consumed by the U.S. Air Force in the first two years of the Korean War was more than double that consumed in the first two years of World War II, and the bombs consumed were one and a quarter times more. The U.S. Air Force consumed more rockets and napalm in Korea than it consumed in the entirety of World War II.

The U.S. Army consumed as many artillery and mortar shells in the first two years of the war of aggression against Korea as it did during the entire period from the Normandy landings to the surrender of Germany in the vast European theater during World War II.

The U.S. Navy's ammunition consumption is also extremely staggering, and its consumption is increasing daily. It consumed nearly twice as much gun ammunition on warships in the second year of the war of aggression against Korea as it did in the first year of the war. It consumed far more rockets than it consumed in its entirety during the war against Germany and Japan. The tonnage of bombs consumed by Navy and Marine Corps aircraft was almost the same as they consumed during World War II.

    侵朝美军兵员弹药损耗严重
    【新华社二十一日讯】华盛顿消息：由于美军在朝鲜前线的巨大损失，美国防部已规定美陆海空军新兵的训练工作，在圣诞节和新年期内照常进行。美国防部解释说，因为轮换的需要急迫，不能容许训练新兵工作停顿十天或二个星期，所以基本训练在假节中，将继续进行。
    【新华社二十日讯】美帝国主义在侵朝战争中不仅兵员损失惨重，在物资的消耗上也空前浩大。据美联社透露：美国国防部在十日发表了美国侵略军自一九五零年六月侵朝战争开始到一九五二年六月三十日为止的两年中的弹药消耗比较数字。美国国防部宣布：美国空军在朝鲜战争的头两年中所消耗的弹药，就比第二次世界大战的头两年所消耗的多一倍，而消耗的炸弹要多一倍又四分之一。美国空军在朝鲜消耗的火箭和凝固汽油弹比它在第二次世界大战期间所消耗的全部还要多。
    美国陆军在侵朝战争头两年中所消耗的大炮与迫击炮炮弹，与第二次世界大战期间美军在诺曼底登陆到德国投降为止在广阔的欧洲战场上所消耗的一样多。
    美国海军弹药的消耗也极为惊人，它的消耗并且是日益增加的。它在侵朝战争第二年中在军舰上消耗的枪炮弹药差不多是战争第一年的两倍。它消耗的火箭比它在对德国和日本作战时所消耗的全部多得多。海军和海军陆战队的飞机所消耗的炸弹的吨数，差不多和它们在第二次世界大战时期所消耗的一样多。
