Xinhua News Agency, 17th: The Japanese delegation to the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference, on the 4th of this month, issued a protest statement against the Yoshida government's order to arrest Japanese delegates attending the conference. The full text is as follows:

    The Yoshida government has issued an order to arrest the Japanese delegation to the Beijing Peace Conference. This atrocity by the Yoshida government, after refusing to issue passports to the delegation and using violence, is an act of suppressing peace-loving Japanese people.
    We are deeply grateful to the head of the Indian delegation for his protest to the Yoshida government, who, in the name of the Indian people, demanded the withdrawal of the arrest order and that the reality of the great Peace Conference be conveyed to the Japanese people. We are also equally grateful to the Chinese people for their infinite sympathy and support during the conference and during our travels in China; and grateful for the generous assistance of the delegates from various countries attending the Peace Conference.
    This atrocity by the Yoshida government is the final desperate act of its deep fear of the peaceful strength of the 1.6 billion people in the Asian and Pacific regions, and exposes it to the world as an enemy of peace.
    We resolutely protest this atrocity! We know that the Japanese people have held the All-Japan Peace Congress in Tokyo to hear the report of the Beijing Peace Conference, and we also know that Japan has launched a movement to send representatives to the World People's Peace Congress in Vienna . We will continue to rely on the strength of the Japanese people who have made great efforts for the cause

    日本出席和平会议代表团发表声明
    抗议吉田政府下令逮捕和平代表的暴行
    【新华社十七日讯】出席亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的日本代表团，本月四日对吉田政府下令逮捕出席这次会议的日本代表，发表抗议声明，全文如下：
    吉田政府已颁布逮捕出席北京和平会议的日本代表团的命令。吉田政府在拒绝给代表团签发护照并使用暴力之后又施行这种暴行，这是一种镇压爱好和平的日本人民的行动。
    我们深深感激印度代表团团长对吉田政府提出的抗议，他以印度人民的名义，要求撤回逮捕的命令，并使伟大和平会议的实况得以向日本人民传达。我们也同样感激中国人民在会议期间和我们在中国旅行期间给予我们的无限同情和支持；并且感激出席和平会议的各国代表的慷慨援助。
    吉田政府的这种暴行，是它深深畏惧亚洲及太平洋区域的十六亿人民的和平力量所作的最后的疯狂行动，并且向全世界暴露了它是和平的敌人。
    我们坚决抗议这种暴行！我们知道日本人民已在东京举行了全日本拥护和平大会来听取北京和平会议的报告，我们并且知道日本已经发动了派遣代表参加维也纳世界人民和平大会的运动。我们将继续依靠对和平事业作了极大努力的日本人民的力量。我们绝不在任何镇压行动面前屈服，我们将为争取和平的胜利而奋斗到底。
