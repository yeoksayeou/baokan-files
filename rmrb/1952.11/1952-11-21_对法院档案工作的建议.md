    Suggestions on Court Archival Work
    Comrade Editor: From what I understand, there are two situations regarding archival work in the People's Courts: one is to inherit the old methods of the pseudo-courts, where a "case receipt number" is assigned when a case is received, and then registered in the case receipt book and the case name index card; after the case is concluded, the files are sent to the archival management department, a "filing number" is assigned, and it is registered in the filing book and the filing name index card. It is obvious waste of manpower and resources for a case to undergo two general registrations and two name indexes within the same court. The other is that when a case is received, it is only registered once in the general case receipt book, and then it is not scientifically managed, making it inconvenient to check during the handling of the case, and even more inconvenient to retrieve the files after the case is concluded. Considering these two situations, I believe that when a case is received, a "case receipt number" should be assigned in the general case receipt register, and then registered in the name index card, and this "case receipt number" and index should still be used when filing. By doing so, for the first situation, the case receipt work and the filing work can be done by one person, which saves manpower and eliminates the need for repetitive registration and indexing. For the second situation, it is only necessary to add a name index card at the time of case receipt, which is convenient for checking and retrieving case files. I offer the above suggestions for the reference of relevant departments.

### 对法院档案工作的建议

    对法院档案工作的建议
    编辑同志：据我了解，人民法院的档案工作有两种情况：一种是承袭伪法院老一套的办法，当案件收进时先编“收案号”，继在收案簿上和收案姓名索引检查簿上登记；案件处理结束后，再把卷宗送到管理档案的部门，编“归档号”，并在归档簿上和归档姓名索引检查簿上登记。一个案件在同一个法院内作了两次总登记和两次姓名索引，显然是浪费人力物力。另一种，当案件收进时，只在总收案簿上登记一次，即不再科学地去管理，以致在处理案件的过程中检查起来不方便，案件结束后再要调卷更是不方便。从这两种情况看，我认为当收进案件时，在总的收案登记簿上编一“收案号”，再在姓名索引检查簿上登记即可，归档时仍用此“收案号”和索引。这样做，对前一种情况，收案工作和归档工作可以由一人兼做，既节省了人力，也不必再重复地登记、做索引。对后一种情况说，只要在收案时加备一姓名索引检查簿即可，便于检查，也便于调取案卷。以上意见特提供有关部门参考。
