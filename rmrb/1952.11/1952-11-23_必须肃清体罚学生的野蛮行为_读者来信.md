    The Barbaric Behavior of Corporal Punishment of Students Must Be Eradicated
    --Summary of Letters from Readers
    Since the Central People's Government Ministry of Education issued the instruction on abolishing corporal punishment of students on February 14th of this year, and newspapers in various regions launched criticisms of the barbaric behavior of some teachers who inflict corporal punishment on students, this issue has attracted the attention of educational authorities and educators in various regions. Those who were criticized have made self-criticisms, and they have also made some improvements in their methods of teaching students. However, judging from the situation reflected in recent letters from readers across the country, this problem has not been completely resolved. Reader Li Xinjian wrote to expose the crude behavior of Tian Zhongting, a teacher at Qianliugusi Elementary School in Hejian County, Hebei Province, who inflicts corporal punishment on students. Yan Xiurui, a student at the school, could not attend school because of family matters and asked someone to ask for a day off for her. When she went to school the next day, Tian Zhongting mobilized other students to "struggle" against her. He ordered Yan Xiurui to stand in the middle of the crowd, and other students held green sorghum stalks around her to scare her, asking her: "Why did you ask someone to pass on your leave request? What kind of thinking is this?" He did not allow Yan Xiurui to go home for lunch. Student Yan Dakou was poor and had no money to buy writing notebooks. He made three notebooks himself. Tian Zhongting disliked them, tore them up, and punched Yan Dakou severely several times, and punished him to stand in the sun. He was covered in sweat from the sun, and he got sick and fell ill as soon as he got home. Due to Tian Zhongting's barbaric behavior, nine students who had been beaten are now unwilling to go to school. Some parents said: "My child goes to school only to be beaten or hung up, and cries when he comes home. I would rather have my child be illiterate than let him go to school to be beaten and hung up."
    What is especially serious is that some teachers dare to set up private courts and arbitrarily hang and beat students. For example, Comrade Lou Qianyan of the Jiangshan County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party of Zhejiang Province wrote to say that Dai Jianglang, a teacher at the Maoshan branch of Jiangshan Wenxi Middle School, lost 480,000 yuan, so he gathered all the students and searched them; although he found nothing, he falsely accused student Wu Weifu of stealing it. He confined Wu Weifu to his dormitory and instructed other students to hang Wu Weifu on a phoenix tree and beat him severely with sticks. He even prevented Wu from participating in the final exam and arbitrarily announced his "expulsion." Even more serious is the incident in which Zhang Wenge and other teachers at Kuiwen Elementary School in Dinghe District, Xixia County, Henan Province, illegally hung and beat student Pang Wenze, forcing him to run away. In June of this year, the school had a spring break. Three teachers from the school went out to engage in production; leaving female teacher Zhang Wenge alone to take care of school affairs. As a result, she lost more than 100 kilograms of wheat from the school. Zhang Wenge could not explain it, so she falsely accused student Pang Wenze of stealing it. Without asking any questions, they called Pang Wenze to interrogate him. They tied Pang Wenze up with rope and hung him from the beam to torture him. This fourteen-year-old child could not withstand this kind of torture and was forced to admit that he had "stolen" the grain. The next day, Zhang Wenge rushed to Pang Wenze's home to demand compensation. Pang Wenze suffered such barbaric persecution at school and was reprimanded by his mother when he returned home. He took a rope and went out that day and has not returned for more than three months.
    In addition, some teachers at Beijing Beimen Cang Wanzi Second Elementary School, Beijing Jingxi Mining Area Huocun Elementary School, Hebei Province Jiaohe County Second District Nanyangzhuang Elementary School, and Hubei Qianjiang County Zhanggang Elementary School have all engaged in corporal punishment of students. There are dozens of types of corporal punishment, such as: beating, confinement, kneeling punishment, not allowing to eat, punishment in the sun, rain, forcing students to beat students, etc.
    Letters from readers unanimously pointed out that corporal punishment of children is a method that old society "teachers" were accustomed to using, the most incompetent, and the most unpromising way to discipline students. It is one of the cruel and barbaric methods of feudalism, imperialism, and fascism to discipline children. In the new China of New Democracy, it is absolutely not allowed to continue to exist. It is requested that relevant leading authorities in various regions seriously deal with teachers who inflict such corporal punishment and disguised corporal punishment on children, and give those who seriously violate human rights and violate laws and discipline the criminal punishment they deserve. In order to protect the healthy development of children's physical and mental health, we must tirelessly fight against this bad phenomenon.

### 必须肃清体罚学生的野蛮行为——读者来信

    必须肃清体罚学生的野蛮行为
    ——读者来信综述
    自从今年二月十四日中央人民政府教育部发出关于废止对学生体罚的指示和各地报纸对某些教师体罚学生的野蛮行为展开批评以后，这个问题已引起了各地教育机关和教育工作者的注意。被批评的人都作了检讨，他们对学生的教导方法也有了一定程度的改进。但从最近各地读者来信所反映的情况看，这个问题还没有彻底解决。读者李新建来信揭露河北省河间县前留古寺小学教师田仲庭体罚学生的粗暴行为。该校学生阎秀蕊因为家里有事不能上学，托别人替她请了一天假。第二天上学时，田仲庭便发动其他的学生来“斗争”她。他命令阎秀蕊站在众人中间，其他学生拿着青秫秸围在四周吓唬她，问她：“为什么叫别人捎着请假？是什么思想？”中午不让阎秀蕊回家吃饭。学生阎大扣家里穷，没钱买写字本子。自己订了三个本子。田仲庭嫌不好，给扯了，又狠狠地打了阎大扣几拳，罚他晒太阳。他晒得满头大汗，连热带饿回家就病倒了。由于田仲庭这种野蛮行为，现在已有九个挨过打的学生不愿上学了。有的家长就说：“俺家孩子上学不是挨打就是挨吊，回家就哭。宁可叫孩子当个睁眼瞎子，也不叫他上学受吊打。”
    尤其严重的，是有的教师竟敢私设公堂，随意吊打学生。如中共浙江江山县委会楼乾燕同志等来信说，江山文溪中学矛坂分部教师戴江郎因为丢失了四十八万元，竟集合全体学生，搜他们的身；结果虽一无所获，但他却诬赖学生吴为福偷的。他把吴为福禁在寝室里，并指使其他学生把吴为福吊在梧桐树上，用棒毒打。他也因此竟阻止吴参加大考，擅自宣布把他“开除”。更严重的是，河南省西峡县丁河区奎文小学教师张文阁等非法吊打逼跑学生庞温泽的事件。今年六月间，学校放春假。该校有三个教员出外搞生产去了；留下女教员张文阁一人照管校中事务。结果她把学校的小麦丢失了一百多斤。张文阁无法交代，便诬赖是学生庞温泽偷的。他们不问青红皂白便把庞温泽叫来审问。用绳子把庞温泽捆起来，吊在梁上用刑。这个十四岁的孩子经不起这种苦刑，被逼承认了粮食是他“偷”的。第二天张文阁就气冲冲地到庞温泽家里去要赔款。庞温泽在学校遭到这样野蛮的迫害，回家又被母亲斥责，当天拿着绳子出去，到现在三个多月还没有回来。
    此外，如北京市北门仓万字第二小学、北京市京西矿区霍村小学、河北省交河县二区南杨庄小学、湖北潜江县张港小学的某些教师，都有体罚学生的行为。体罚的名堂多至几十种，如：打、关、罚跪、不准吃饭、罚晒太阳、淋雨、强迫学生打学生等。
    读者来信一致指出：体罚儿童是旧社会当“老师”的惯于使用的一种最无能、最没出息的管教学生的办法，是封建主义、帝国主义、法西斯主义管教儿童的残酷野蛮方法之一。在新民主主义的新中国，决不容许其继续存在。要求各地有关领导机关对这种体罚和变相体罚儿童的教师，作认真严肃的处理，并给严重侵犯人权、违法乱纪的人以应得的刑事处分。为了保护儿童身心的健康发展，我们必须不疲倦地和这种恶劣现象作斗争。
