Xinhua News Agency, 23rd Dispatch: According to the Vietnam News Agency on the 22nd, the General Command of the Vietnam People's Army recently announced that the People's Army annihilated over 2,000 French troops in the Black River basin between November 17th and 20th.

After liberating the vast area between the upper reaches of the Red River and the Black River, the Vietnam People's Army crossed the Black River in triumph. During the aforementioned four days, they uprooted all the French military strongholds on the Moc Chau Plateau in Son La Province. Subsequently, they forced the French troops stationed in An Chau to flee, annihilating one French battalion and eight companies, and capturing the entire staff of a French battalion headquarters. Simultaneously, the Vietnam People's Army liberated Luan Chau and Dun Jiao along the Lai Chau-Son La highway, routing five companies belonging to the French Second Colonial Parachute Battalion and the Bao Dai puppet army's 56th Battalion. The People's Army is currently pursuing the fleeing French troops in triumph.

Among the more than 2,000 French troops annihilated by the People's Army in this area, 80 percent were captured, including the commander of the 3rd Battalion of the French 1st Moroccan Regiment, Lu Kai, the commander of the French Moc Chau military sub-district, Wan Sang, and the commander of Dun Jiao, Du Lang. The People's Army also seized the majority of the ammunition and other military supplies accumulated by the French army in this area.

Xinhua News Agency, 24th Dispatch: (North Vietnam News) To coordinate with the victorious battles in Phu Tho, the Black River, and Phat Diem in Ninh Binh Province, the Vietnam People's Army is intensifying its operations in the Red River Delta, inflicting heavy losses on the French army.

On the evening of November 16th, the People's Army units in Nam Dinh Province uprooted the French stronghold of Qing Yan (15 kilometers southeast of Phat Diem), annihilating one French company and seizing all the French army's weapons and other military supplies in the area.

On November 15th, the local People's Army of Kien An Province intercepted a French army unit attempting to harass nearby guerrilla areas between Kien An City and Ning Giang Town, and ambushed its support forces, annihilating one company of French African troops, capturing 25 people, and seizing one mortar, 16 light machine guns and submachine guns, 35 rifles, and one radio station.

Xinhua News Agency, 22nd Dispatch: The invading French army is in a desperate situation after suffering heavy blows from the Vietnam People's Army.

After admitting the disastrous defeat at Nghia Lo, the French invading army headquarters publicly admitted on the 18th that it could not stop the Vietnam People's Army's offensive against the heart of the French army in the Red River Delta.

The French army headquarters announced that it had dispatched a large number of American-aided aircraft for non-stop bombing day and night in an attempt to block the Vietnam People's Army. However, according to an Associated Press dispatch on the 18th, in the densely populated Phat Diem area in the southeast of the delta, just as French aircraft were carrying out 100 sorties of air raids, the Vietnam People's Army captured two French strongholds and even briefly entered Phat Diem city.

Under the heavy blows of the Vietnam People's Army, the French invading army headquarters admitted on the 18th that the French army's adventurous offensive towards Phu Tho had suffered a disastrous defeat. The French army, ordered to retreat completely, was ambushed by the Vietnam People's Army everywhere. A French commander, Colonel Kergaravat, who escaped under cover of darkness, told a United Press reporter about the desperate situation of his troops being attacked. Kergaravat also said that the Vietnam People's Army bombarded and strafed the French troops with rocket launchers, mortars, and machine guns. French tanks and tracked vehicles rushed into the fire net in an attempt to open a path; however, one tank was destroyed by a rocket launcher, blocking the way and causing the six armored vehicles behind it to be shot at by the People's Army.

In view of the serious military situation in North Vietnam, the French military authorities have hastily requisitioned civilian aircraft to draw reinforcements from South and Central Vietnam to North Vietnam.

    越南人民军在黑水江流域歼敌二千多人
    拔除山萝省木州高原全部法军据点并解放伦州等地
    【新华社二十三日讯】据越南通讯社二十二日讯：越南人民军总司令部最近公布：人民军在十一月十七日到二十日间又在黑水江流域歼灭了法军二千多人。
    越南人民军在解放了红河上游与黑水江之间的广大地区后，乘胜渡过了黑水江，在上述四日间拔除了山萝省木州高原的全部法军据点，接着迫使驻安州的法军逃窜，歼灭了法军一个营和八个连，俘掳了法军一个营部的全体人员。同时，越南人民军沿莱州—山萝之间的公路解放了伦州和敦交，击溃了属于法军第二殖民地伞兵营和保大伪军第五十六营的五个连。人民军正在乘胜追击溃逃的法军。
    人民军在这个地区歼灭的二千多名法军中，俘掳的占百分之八十，其中包括法军第一摩洛哥团第三营营长鲁凯、法军木州军分区的指挥官万桑和敦交的指挥官杜朗。人民军并缴获了法军积存在这个地区的绝大部分弹药与其他军事供应品。
    【新华社二十四日讯】越南通讯社北越消息：为了配合在富寿、黑水江和宁平省发艳的胜利战斗，越南人民军在红河三角洲加紧作战，使法军受到严重的损失。
    南定省人民军部队十一月十六日晚拔除了法军据点青艳（发艳东南十五公里），歼灭了法军一个连，并缴获了该地法军的全部武器和其他军事供应品。
    建安省地方人民军于十一月十五日在建安城和宁江镇之间，截击了一支企图窜扰附近游击区的法军部队，并伏击其后援部队，歼灭了法军欧非籍部队一个连，俘掳了二十五人，缴获了迫击炮一门、轻机枪和冲锋枪十六支，步枪三十五支和电台一部。
    【新华社二十二日讯】侵越法军在受到越南人民军的沉重打击后，正陷于狼狈不堪的境地。
    侵越法军总司令部在承认义路惨败后，十八日又公开承认挡不住越南人民军对红河三角洲法军心脏地区的进攻。
    法军总司令部宣布，已派出大量美援飞机作昼夜不停的轰炸，力图阻挡越南人民军。但据美联社十八日讯：在三角洲东南方人口稠密的发艳地区，就在法军飞机出动一百架次从事空袭的时候，越南人民军攻下了法军据点两处，并且一度攻进发艳城内。
    在越南人民军的重大打击下，侵越法军总司令部十八日承认法军向富寿的冒险进攻已遭惨败。奉令总撤退的法军到处受到越南人民军的伏击。一个乘黑夜逃出的法军指挥官克尔加拉瓦上校向合众社记者谈到他所指挥的部队遭到袭击的狼狈情形，克尔加拉瓦并说：越南人民军用火箭炮、迫击炮和机关枪轰击、扫射法军队伍，法军坦克和履带牵引车向火网冲去，企图打开出路；但一架坦克被火箭炮击毁了，挡住去路，使拥塞在后面的六辆战车又遭到人民军的射击。
    鉴于北越军事形势的严重，法国军事当局已仓皇地征用民用飞机从南越和中越抽调援军到北越去。
