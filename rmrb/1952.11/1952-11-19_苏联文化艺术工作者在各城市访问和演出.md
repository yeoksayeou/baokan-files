The forum was presided over by Bai Xi, manager of the Northeast China Region Company of the China Film Distribution and Exhibition Corporation. He first introduced the situation that Soviet films are universally respected and loved by people of all strata in the Northeast. Then, Guo Zhongtian, a combat hero of the Volunteer Army, spoke. He said: I have watched many Soviet films, and they have given me a great education. I have watched "The Fall of Berlin" nine times, and "The Brave People" twelve times. The reason why I want to watch it repeatedly is because it tells me how to love the motherland and how to defend the motherland. Every time I watch it, it strengthens my combat power! The next speaker was Wang Huikang, a cultural teacher from a certain factory. She excitedly recounted how the film "The Village Teacher" educated her and made her a model worker. She presented Smirnova, the screenwriter of "The Village Teacher," with a Mao Zedong badge on the spot. They embraced each other affectionately. The speech of a young student from Shenyang Municipal No. 10 Middle School moved the emotions of all the people present. She said: "Dear Soviet uncles and aunts, my name is Mu Lingpu, and I am thirteen years old this year. From your appearance, you must think I am a boy, but I am not, I am a girl! In the winter of 1950, in order to join the Chinese People's Volunteers, my friend Tian Qunzhi and I cut our long hair. The reason why we did this at the time was because the Soviet films "Little Navy" and "Little Hero" both had such people who could bravely fight the enemy in order to defend their motherland. Why can't we learn from them!" To thank the Soviet films for her education, she took off her beloved red scarf and personally put it on the neck of the famous Soviet director Petrov. Her friend Tian Qunzhi also took off her red scarf and put it on the neck of the head of the delegation Fedorov. Fedorov and Petrov excitedly picked them up and hugged them. At this time, the whole audience stood up and cheered thunderously. In a warm and friendly atmosphere, Fedorov, head of the Soviet Film Art Workers Delegation, stood up and spoke, expressing his gratitude to everyone for their love of Soviet films and the high praise they gave. Smirnova and Ladinina, the protagonist in the film "Happy Life," also stood up and made brief and enthusiastic speeches. Smirnova said: Your love for us has given us an obligation to serve you and the people of the world better. I assure you that I will do everything in my power and all my wisdom to serve the people of the world!
