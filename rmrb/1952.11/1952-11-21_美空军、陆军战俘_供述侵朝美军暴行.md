Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, November 18th: The "Pravda" correspondent in Pyongyang, Dekachenko, reports on the atrocities committed by American air pirates shot down by North Korean anti-aircraft guns. US Air Force Captain Robert Charles Henry confessed to dropping 4,412 high-explosive bombs, fragmentation bombs, napalm bombs, and time bombs on North Korean cities and villages. This air pirate said that for a night flight, he could get fifty to one hundred and twenty dollars, and for a day flight, he could get twenty-five to seventy-five dollars, the actual amount depending on the results of his bombing. The executioner Henry and his crew members, Kennis Fester and Richard Huber—both of whom, like their captain Henry, were thugs and bandits—were unable to fly back to their finance office to collect their bounty after a night of terror bombing near Pyongyang. Their plane was shot down, and all three were captured.

One can see from Henry's facial expression that he is completely unmoved by the fact that his two evil hands are stained with the blood of Korean women and children, and that the bombs dropped by his crew burned down Korean schools, hospitals, temples, and houses. But Henry cannot hide the fact that it is now more difficult and frightening for American "braves" to fly over North Korea than before, because there are now more North Korean and Chinese anti-aircraft guns and planes, which are causing great anxiety to the US Air Force.

Dekachenko said: But, apart from those bandit troops, more and more American soldiers in North Korea are waking up. Another airman, Eugene Steer, of the 51st Air Force Group, who was shot down by North Korean anti-aircraft fire, said: If the US government continues the Korean War, if the United Nations does not stop this dishonorable war, the United States will lose all face in front of the world. Airmen like Eugene Steer are increasingly aware that the American rulers are dragging American youth into the abyss, and that millions of American youth have already been buried in the distant, peaceful, and innocent land of North Korea.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, November 15th: "Korean People's Army" newspaper quoted the confession of an American captured soldier who had witnessed and participated in many atrocities committed by the US military in North Korea. This American prisoner confessed: Our air force bombs everything. It is difficult to describe the damage caused by our bombs and napalm bombs to North Korean cities and villages. In some places I have been, I can't even see a farmer's thatched hut. What surprised me most was that our army wantonly carried out destruction.

The prisoner also talked about the "recreation" of American soldiers. He said: We forced North Korean prisoners to run and then shot them in the legs with pistols. When our army was north of the 38th parallel, I often shot or beat Koreans. I also participated in rape several times.

    美空军、陆军战俘
    供述侵朝美军暴行
    【新华社二十日讯】塔斯社莫斯科十八日讯：“真理报”驻平壤记者德卡诚科报道那些被朝鲜高射炮打下来的美国空中强盗所干的暴行。美国空军上尉罗勃特·查理斯·亨利对朝鲜城市和乡村共投掷了四千四百十二颗高度爆炸弹、杀伤弹、凝固汽油弹和定时炸弹。这个空中强盗说，进行一次夜间飞行，他可以得到五十到一百二十美元，进行一次日间飞行，他可以得到二十五到七十五美元，实际所得的钱数，要看他轰炸的结果而定。刽子手亨利和他的队员坎尼斯·费斯泰及里查德·胡柏——这两个人和他们的队长亨利一样，都是强盗匪徒——在对平壤近郊进行了一次夜间的恐怖轰炸后，并没有能够飞回去到他们的财务处领取赏金。他们的飞机被击落，他们三个人被俘。
    人们可以从亨利的面部表情中看出：他对于他的两只罪恶的手沾染了朝鲜妇女和儿童的鲜血，以及他的队员所投下的炸弹烧毁了朝鲜的学校、医院、庙宇和住宅，是丝毫无动于中的。但是亨利不能掩饰这样一个事实：对于美国“健儿”来说，现在在朝鲜上空飞行，比以前是更困难而且更可怕了，因为现在朝中方面的高射炮和飞机更多了，它们使美国空军感到极为不安。
    德卡诚科说：但是，除去那些匪军外，朝鲜美军中间越来越多的人在清醒过来。另一个空军人员、被朝鲜对空射击手击落的第五十一空军大队的尤琴·斯泰尔说：如果美国政府继续进行朝鲜战争，如果联合国不制止这个不光荣的战争，美国就要在全世界面前丢尽脸面。像尤琴·斯泰尔这样的空军人员越来越认识到美国统治者们正在把美国青年拖入深渊，而且已经有千万美国青年被埋葬在遥远的、和平的、无辜的朝鲜土地上。
    【新华社讯】塔斯社平壤十五日电：“朝鲜人民军”报引用一个曾目睹过和参加过美军在朝鲜所干的许多暴行的美国被俘士兵的供词。这个美国俘虏供称：我们的空军对什么都要轰炸。很难描述我们的炸弹和凝固汽油弹给朝鲜城市和村庄造成的损失。在我所到过的一些地方，连一所农民的草舍都看不到。最使我吃惊的是：我们的军队肆意进行破坏。
    这个俘虏又谈到关于美国士兵的“消遣”。他说：我们逼着北朝鲜俘虏跑，然后用手枪射击他们的腿。当我们军队在三八线以北时，我经常枪击或殴打朝鲜人。我也有好几次参加强奸。
