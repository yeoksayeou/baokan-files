    On the Performance of the Soviet Army Alexandrov Red Banner Song and Dance Ensemble
    Song Zhidi
    During the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month," the Soviet people sent the Chinese people the most precious gift: the Soviet Army Alexandrov Red Banner Song and Dance Ensemble, one of the largest and most outstanding art troupes in the Soviet Union, came to China to perform.
    The artistic power of the Soviet Army Red Banner Song and Dance Ensemble evokes feelings of victory, strength, pride, joy, and happiness in us. The songs and dances of the Soviet Army Red Banner Song and Dance Ensemble mainly focus on the combat life, heroic spirit, and optimism of Soviet soldiers. The artists of the Soviet Army Red Banner Song and Dance Ensemble possess highly developed artistic skills. The artistic style of the Soviet Army Red Banner Song and Dance Ensemble is combative, mass-oriented, bright, and simple.
    The songs "The Sun Sets" and "Along the Mountains, Along the Plains" both take the combat life of Soviet soldiers as their theme. "The Sun Sets" is a marching song of Soviet soldiers after the Patriotic War, and "Along the Mountains, Along the Plains" is an early guerrilla song from the Far East. Both songs give people the same feeling of optimism, love for the motherland and the people, and being full of fighting will and combat power. "Along the Mountains, Along the Plains" was adapted from a song sung by soldiers, which was widely popular among the Chinese People's Army during the War of Resistance Against Japan. Since then, the Chinese People's Army has loved this song, and it has inspired the fighting will of the Chinese people.
    The chorus "Echo" demonstrates the high technical proficiency, skillful vocal coordination, and accomplished conducting of the Soviet Army Red Banner Song and Dance Ensemble's choir, making the listener feel as if they are in the mountains, with sounds rising and falling, and echoes reverberating.
    The performance of the Chinese songs "The East is Red" and "The Second Month Comes" made these two songs, which are widely popular among the Chinese people, even more beautiful. The chorus of "The East is Red" enhances the solemnity and power of the folk melody, making the people's feelings of praising the great leader even deeper. "The Second Month Comes" is more lyrical and charming thanks to the artistic creation of Russian Merited Artist Nikitin.
    The artistic accomplishment of the Soviet Army Red Banner Song and Dance Ensemble's male choir is unparalleled. The choir's singing is like a set of wonderful instruments. This set of instruments leads us to the valleys for a while, and then to the fields for a while, sometimes immersing us in the joy of life, and sometimes filling us with confidence to go into battle. Sometimes we are shocked by the powerful and majestic sound; sometimes we are intoxicated by a subtle and quiet sound, as if being blown by a intoxicating wind in spring. The Red Banner Song and Dance Ensemble's male choir is a great and magical artistic creation.
    "The Grand Military Dance" is a vibrant and powerful dance. This dance is divided into three parts: "The first part uses dance to express the victory parade of the Soviet army after defeating the German fascist bandits. Representatives of various branches of the Soviet army participate in the parade: tank drivers, artillerymen, air force, navy, infantry, and cavalry. Finally, a group of teenagers—students from the Suvorov Military School, future officers. The second part is a dance between soldiers and girls who come to participate in the grand people's festival, wearing the bright costumes of various Soviet nationalities. First, the Belarusians dance a folk dance. They dance the "Kryzhachok" dance. Then the Ukrainians dance the "Gopak" dance, and two Tatar girls dance a light and cheerful dance. Later, the Georgian "Lezginka" dance is performed. Finally, it ends with a Russian folk dance. The third part is a competition of outstanding dancers from various branches and nationalities." (Quoted from the program description.) The theme of the three parts is simple, the expression is strong and profound, and the structure is natural. Both the music and dance have a strong national style. Interweaving the various branches of the army together, but expressing the characteristics of each branch; interweaving the various nationalities together, but fully utilizing the advantages of each national dance; interspersing individual superb stunts in the collective dance, the high-speed rotation in the stunts reaching a magical level; each national dance is accompanied by the music of that nation, but the music, like its theme, is so harmonious and consistent. "Soldiers' Competition Dance" is a dance that expresses revolutionary heroism, and the competition encourages people to move forward. The entire dance revolves around one theme, powerfully expressing the victory, unity, strength, and happiness of the people's army and the people. From the "Sabre Dance," we see the bravery and might of the Soviet army, and from the "Camp Dance," we see the revolutionary optimism of the Soviet army. These dances have a high degree of ideological and artistic quality.
    The Soviet Army Red Banner Song and Dance Ensemble's military combat style, realistic creative path, and advanced artistic traditions are of particularly important significance to our country's military literary and art workers. The path of the Soviet Army Red Banner Song and Dance Ensemble is the path of our military song and dance troupes.
    The Soviet Army Red Banner Song and Dance Ensemble has the title of "Soviet Song Laboratory" in its creative activities because it can closely integrate with the Soviet people's real struggle life and combine with the people's thoughts and feelings. This is one of the reasons why the Soviet Army Red Banner Song and Dance Ensemble's performance programs are loved by the people. The Chinese people love the art of the Soviet Army Red Banner Song and Dance Ensemble, and the advanced art of the Soviet Army Red Banner Song and Dance Ensemble is a model for us to learn from. The performances given by the Soviet Army Red Banner Song and Dance Ensemble to the Chinese people will not only enhance the close and unbreakable friendship between the two peoples, but will also leave our country's literary and art workers with a most valuable asset.

    记苏军亚历山大罗夫红旗歌舞团的表演
    宋之的
    在“中苏友好月”里，苏联人民给我国人民送来了最珍贵的礼物，苏联最大的最优秀的艺术团体之一——苏军亚历山大罗夫红旗歌舞团来到我国表演了。
    苏军红旗歌舞团的艺术力量，唤起我们胜利、强大、自豪、愉快和幸福的感觉。苏军红旗歌舞团的歌舞节目，以苏联军人的战斗生活、英雄气概、乐观主义精神为主要内容。苏军红旗歌舞团的艺术家们，具有高度的艺术技巧。苏军红旗歌舞团的艺术风格是战斗的、群众的、明朗的、朴实的。
    歌曲“太阳落山”和“沿着高山，沿着平原”都是以苏联军人的战斗生活为主题的。“太阳落山”是卫国战争以后的苏联士兵的行军歌，“沿着高山，沿着平原”是早期的远东的游击队歌。这两首歌同样给人以乐观的，热爱祖国热爱人民的，充满战斗意志和充满战斗力量的感觉。“沿着高山，沿着平原”是根据一首战士唱的歌加工创作的，这首歌在抗日战争时期，曾在中国人民军队中广泛流行过。从那时候起，中国人民军队就热爱这只歌曲，这只歌鼓舞了中国人民的战斗意志。
    合唱“回声”，表现了苏军红旗歌舞团合唱队的高度技术修养、巧妙的声部配合和纯熟的指挥，使人听了仿佛身处群山之中，音响起伏，回声缭绕。
    中国歌曲“东方红”和“二月里来”的演唱，使这两首在中国人民中间广泛流行的歌曲更美丽了。“东方红”的合唱增强了民歌曲调的庄严和力量，使得人民歌颂伟大领袖的感情更深刻了。“二月里来”由于俄罗斯功勋演员尼基丁的艺术创作，是更抒情，更有魅力了。
    苏军红旗歌舞团的男声合唱团的艺术造诣是无以伦比的。合唱团的歌声仿佛就是一组美妙的乐器。这组乐器一会儿把我们引向山谷，一会儿又把我们引向原野，一会儿使我们沉浸在生活的喜悦里，一会儿又使我们满怀信心地走向战斗。有时我们会为强大的、雄壮的声音所震撼；有时我们又会为一种微妙的幽静的声音所沉醉，仿佛在春天给一种醉人的风吹荡着似的。红旗歌舞团的男声合唱团是一个伟大而神奇的艺术创作。
    “大军舞”是一个朝气蓬勃充满力量的舞蹈。这个舞蹈共分三部：“第一部分是以舞蹈来表现苏军战胜德国法西斯匪帮之后的胜利大检阅。参加检阅的有苏军各兵种的代表：坦克手、炮兵、空军、海军、步兵和骑兵。最后是一批少年——苏沃洛夫军事学校的学生，未来的军官。第二部分是士兵和前来参加盛大人民节日的姑娘们跳舞，穿着苏联各民族的鲜艳服装。先是白俄罗斯人跳民族舞。他们跳的是“克雷查乔克”舞。接着是乌克兰人跳“弋巴克”舞，两个鞑靼姑娘跳轻松愉快的舞。后来是跳格鲁吉亚的“列士根卡”舞。最后以俄罗斯民族舞结束。第三部分是各兵种各民族优秀舞蹈家的竞赛。”（引自节目说明。）三部分的主题是单纯的，表现力是强烈而深刻的，结构是自然的。音乐和舞蹈都具有强烈的民族风格。把各兵种交织在一起，但却表现了各兵种的特性；把各民族交织在一起，但却充分地发挥了各个民族舞蹈的优点；在集体舞蹈中穿插了个人卓绝的特技表演，特技表演中高速度旋转达到了神奇的地步；每一民族的舞蹈都配了那一民族的音乐，但音乐正像其主题一样，是那样和谐一致。“士兵竞赛舞”是表现革命英雄主义的舞蹈，竞赛是鼓舞人前进的。整个舞蹈围绕着一个主题，有力地表现了人民军队和人民的胜利、团结、强大和幸福。从“马刀舞”中，看到了苏维埃军队的英勇威武，从“宿营地舞”中，看到了苏维埃军队的革命乐观主义的风格。这些舞蹈是具有高度的思想性和艺术性的。
    苏军红旗歌舞团的部队战斗作风，现实主义的创作道路，和其先进的艺术传统，对我国部队的文艺工作者，有着特别重要的意义。苏军红旗歌舞团的道路就是我们部队歌舞团的道路。
    苏军红旗歌舞团在其创作活动上，因为能够紧密地结合苏联人民的现实斗争生活，结合人民的思想感情，所以有“苏联歌曲实验室”的称号。这正是苏军红旗歌舞团的表演节目能够为人民所热爱的原因之一。中国人民热爱苏军红旗歌舞团的艺术，苏军红旗歌舞团的先进艺术是我们学习的榜样。苏军红旗歌舞团向中国人民群众所作的表演，不仅会增进两国人民的亲密的牢不可破的友谊，而且将会给我国人民文艺工作者留下一份最宝贵的财产。
