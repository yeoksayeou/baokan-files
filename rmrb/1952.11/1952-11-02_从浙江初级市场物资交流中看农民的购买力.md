    On the Purchasing Power of Farmers as Seen from Zhejiang's Primary Market Material Exchanges
    Zhuang Yumin
    From mid-July to mid-September, Zhejiang Province successively convened twenty-seven primary market material exchange conferences centered on market towns. These material exchange conferences reveal new circumstances in the purchasing and selling demands of farmers after the autumn harvest.
    The Rise in Farmers' Purchasing Power
    According to estimates by the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Commerce, the purchasing power of Zhejiang farmers this year is approximately 32% higher than last year, with about 40% of the total purchasing power being invested in the market during the fourth quarter. At various primary markets, the purchase of goods by farmers has shown a new atmosphere. The sales of mid-grade daily-use general merchandise have greatly increased, while the sales of low-grade goods have decreased. At the Hengcun Town Material Exchange Conference in Tonglu County, farmer Wang Zhangqing (a family of three) bought five zhang of cloth at once. He said, "In the past, our ancestors never bought more than two zhang of cloth at a time. Life is very different this year!" Although this conference was held in September, more than 200 bolts of gauze for mosquito nets used in the summer, as well as more than 40 bolts of pongee, which would generally be considered 'outdated,' were all sold out. Many teenage farmers bought toothbrushes and toothpaste; local rural women bought 852 sanitary napkins. A township cadre said, "Another 800 could also be sold." Similar situations occurred at various exchange conferences, proving that the purchasing power of farmers in 1952 was higher than in any year since liberation.
    Farmers' Purchasing Power is Reflected in Two Aspects
    Farmers mainly purchase things in these two aspects: one is for developing production, and the other is for improving life. The situation of the twenty-seven primary market material exchange conferences in Zhejiang proves that farmers first purchase means of production. At various primary market material exchange conferences, the best-selling items were various agricultural implements and various handicrafts directly related to production. At the Xincang District Material Exchange Conference in Pinghu County, farmer representatives made three requests to the conference: 1. Purchase 8,000 "San Mian Kuai" (San Mian Kuai is a new type of agricultural tool used by farmers to dig up rice roots to eliminate pests); 2. Purchase 1.35 million jin of green chaff (green chaff is the main feed for raising pigs locally); 3. Exchange for draught cattle. The farmers said, "If these problems are not solved, the conference will be meaningless." Agricultural implements, fertilizers, and feed are the first things that farmers in various places need to buy.
    After purchasing means of production, farmers use a large amount of money to purchase means of livelihood. The biggest expense is adding clothing. At the Fotang Town Material Exchange Conference in Yiwu County, retail sales in the market exceeded 1.3 billion yuan, of which cotton cloth sales ranked first, accounting for 34%, general merchandise ranked second, accounting for 17.43%, and dried and preserved goods ranked third, accounting for 11.55%; among cotton cloths, serge, twill, and blue cloth sold best. At the Hengcun Town Material Exchange Conference in Tonglu County, 110,000 chi of cotton cloth were traded in five days, of which quilt cloth and blue cloth accounted for the vast majority.
    Farmers' Demand for Industrial Products is Unprecedentedly High
    The proportion of urban industrial products in the means of production and means of livelihood purchased by farmers has increased unprecedentedly. In July and August, the main crops such as late rice, cotton, and hemp were not yet on the market in large quantities, but farmers had already made many new demands for urban industrial products at the primary market material exchange conferences in various places. At the Wuyuan Town Material Exchange Conference in Haiyan County from August 8th to August 12th, farmers purchased 149 gas lamps; farmers in an ordinary village, Weidong Second Village, bought six in partnership to control pests. Farmers in the Jiaxing area ordered hundreds of water pumps at the material exchange conferences. At the Hengcun Town Material Exchange Conference in Tonglu County, farmers purchased goods worth 1.002342 billion yuan, of which the total value of industrial products was 67.058 million yuan, accounting for more than 60% of the purchase amount.
    A significant situation in the twenty-seven primary market material exchange conferences is that the total value of industrial products, handicrafts, and other commodities purchased by farmers is roughly equal to the total value of agricultural products and sideline products sold. The total retail transaction amount of the Hengcun Town Material Exchange Conference in Tonglu County was 2.0423 billion yuan, of which the total value of agricultural products and local specialties retailed by farmers was 1.018888 billion yuan, and the total value of industrial products, handicrafts, and local specialties retailed was 1.02342 billion yuan.
    This phenomenon reflects that farmers rely on selling agricultural products and sideline products to purchase industrial products, handicrafts, and other commodities. At the Dangshan Town Material Exchange Conference in Shaoxing County, farmers stated that only after selling dried mustard greens, dried radishes, homespun cloth, and miscellaneous grains can they purchase agricultural implements and other things. At the Wuyuan Town Material Exchange Conference in Haiyan County, all 28 households in Group 12 of Village 12 in Tangnan Township immediately bought 10 bolts of hemp cloth, 21 sickles, 5 brooms, 3 jin of tung oil, and 4 dustpans after selling 125 jars of big-head vegetables, 15 dan of old pumpkins, 4 dan of firewood, 60 jin of garlic, and 33 liang of local silk. It can be seen that organizing the supply of industrial products to the countryside must be based on vigorously promoting the sales of local agricultural and sideline products needed by farmers. Therefore, farmers demand to purchase a large number of industrial and handicraft products, and at the same time, they also demand to sell their own agricultural products and sideline products in large quantities. This is reflected in the material exchange of primary markets, where one hand holds agricultural and sideline products and demands promotion, while the other hand reaches out to buy industrial and handicraft products, etc.

    从浙江初级市场物资交流中看农民的购买力
    庄育民
    七月中旬到九月中旬，浙江先后召开了二十七个以集镇为中心的初级市场物资交流大会。从这些物资交流大会中，可看出农民秋后购销要求的新情况。
    农民购买力的上升
    浙江农民的购买力，根据该省商业厅推算：今年约比去年提高百分之三十二，在第四季度中投入市场的约占总购买力的百分之四十。在各个初级市场上，农民购买商品出现了新的气象。中级日用百货销量大增，低级货销路减少。桐庐县横村镇物资交流大会上，农民王樟清（一家三口人）一次买了五丈布，他说：“过去祖祖辈辈一次买布从来不到两丈，今年生活和过去大不同了！”这次大会虽在九月召开，但夏季作蚊帐用的二百多匹纱布，以及按一般规律说已属“过时”的四十多匹府绸，都一销而光。许多十几岁的农民子弟都买了牙刷、牙膏；当地农村妇女买了八百五十二条卫生月经带。乡干部说：“再有八百条也可以卖得掉。”类似的情形，在各个交流大会上都有，证明一九五二年农民购买力比解放以来任何一年都高了。
    农民购买力表现在两个方面
    农民主要购买这两方面的东西：一是用于发展生产，一是用于改善生活。浙江二十七个初级市场物资交流大会的情况证明：农民首先是添置生产资料。各个初级市场物资交流大会中，最畅销的是各种农具，以及和生产直接有关的各种手工业产品。平湖县新仓区物资交流大会中，农民代表对大会提出三个要求：一、购进“三面快”八千把（三面快，是一种新式农具，农民用来挖掘稻根，以除虫害）；二、购进青糠一百三十五万斤（青糠是当地养猪的主要饲料）；三、换购耕牛。农民说：“这些问题不解决，大会便无意思了。”农具、肥料、饲料，这是各地农民最先需要购买的。
    农民在添置生产资料以后，即以很大数目的钱，购买生活资料。其中最大的用项，是添置衣服。义乌县佛堂镇物资交流大会上，市场零售十三亿余元，其中棉布销路占第一位，为百分之三十四，百货占第二位，为百分之十七·四三，南北货占第三位，为百分之十一·五五；棉布中又以哔叽、斜纹、蓝布等销路最好。桐庐县横村镇物资交流大会上，五天成交棉布十一万尺，其中被子布和蓝布占了绝大比重。
    农民对工业品的要求空前提高
    农民所购买的生产资料与生活资料中，城市工业品的比重都空前提高了。七、八月间，主要农作物如晚稻、棉、麻均未大量上市，但农民已在各地初级市场物资交流大会上对城市工业品提出了许多新的要求：海盐县武原镇八月八日至八月十二日的物资交流大会中，农民购进一百四十九只汽灯；圩东二村一个普通村庄的农民合伙买了六只，用以治虫。嘉兴地区农民在物资交流大会中订购数百台抽水机。桐庐县横村镇物资交流大会上，农民购进十亿零二千三百四十二万元的商品，其中工业品的总值计六亿七千零五十八万元，占购进额百分之六十以上。
    二十七个初级市场物资交流大会中，有一种显著的情况是：农民购进工业品、手工业品及其他商品的总值与销售的农产品和副业产品的总值大致相等。桐庐县横村镇物资交流大会的零售交易总额是二十亿四千二百三十万元，其中农民零售的农产品和土特产品的总值是十亿一千八百八十八万元，零购的工业品、手工业品和土特产品的总值是十亿二千三百四十二万元。
    这种现象反映了农民是依靠卖出农产品和副业产品以购进工业品、手工业品和其他商品。绍兴县党山镇物资交流大会中，农民提出：只有把霉干菜、萝卜干、土布、杂粮出售以后，才能购置农具和其他东西。海盐县武原镇物资交流大会中，塘南乡十二村十二组全组二十八户，在销出一百二十五坛大头菜，十五担老南瓜，四担柴，六十斤蒜和三十三两土丝后，立即买进十匹麻布，二十一把镰刀，五把扫帚，三斤桐油和四只畚箕。由此可见，组织工业品下乡必须建筑在大力推销当地农民需要出售的农副产品的基础上。因此，农民要求大量购进工业品和手工业品，同时也就要求大量出售自己的农产品和副业产品。表现在初级市场的物资交流上，便是一只手拿着农产品和副业产品要求推销，另一只手伸出来买进工业品和手工业品等。
