The theoretical study of senior cadres in the Industrial Department of the Northeast People's Government (hereinafter referred to as the Industrial Department) has persisted for nearly three years and has achieved significant results. The vast majority of cadres who participated in the study felt that this study did indeed play a significant role. This is manifested in the following ways: the cadres' ideological level has been raised, their working methods have been improved, and the cadres' political enthusiasm has greatly increased as a result; the leadership's policies are easier to implement, the steps of superiors and subordinates are more consistent, and political theory study is no longer regarded as an extra burden but as an indispensable item for improving work.

Brief Overview of the Study Over the Past Three Years

The theoretical study for senior cadres of the Industrial Department was established in early 1950. At that time, industrial production in Northeast China was in a tense stage of recovery. Most of the cadres involved in industry took on this new job position in late 1948 and early 1949. Although some cadres had some experience in leading industry in the base areas, they had never led so many modern factories and mines or undertaken such arduous and complex tasks as they do today. After the initial democratic reforms and the mass movement to create new records in 1949, a new face has started to appear in Northeast China's industrial production. How to establish a responsibility system in enterprise management and gradually implement strict planned management and economic accounting system management had become an urgent task for all cadres at this time. In order to complete this task, the more responsible cadres were first required to seriously study the advanced Soviet theories and experience in enterprise management and improve their leadership methods. At that time, some serious problems began to arise among some senior cadres; that is, the danger of "grasping business and losing politics" was gradually growing. There was a style of bureaucracy in the work of various bureaus and departments, which lacked political foresight. Many bureau and division chiefs were extremely busy, but they couldn't grasp the core, couldn't put forward key issues, and were often in a passive and coping state. The leadership's policies within the department were very difficult to implement. Many responsible comrades in the bureaus and divisions, proceeding from departmentalism, emphasized the importance of their own departments or factories and mines, emphasized the difficulties in their work, and complained that the leadership did not understand the situation. Some cadres involved in light industry expressed dissatisfaction with the leadership's emphasis on the development of heavy industry, believing that light industry was more urgently needed to improve people's living standards. Some comrades expressed dissatisfaction with the leadership's emphasis on certain industrial centers as development priorities, believing that the leadership should not "favor one over the other." They felt that the more funds and cadres they could get, the better, and the lower the work tasks and quotas were set, the better. Some cadres believed that "talking about politics cannot start the engine," and some cadres said when using technical personnel with unclear political backgrounds: "No matter what kind of cadres they are, as long as they understand technology, that's enough."

Under such circumstances, the leadership of the Industrial Department decided to strengthen the political theory study of senior cadres and earnestly practice the instructions of the Central Committee and the Northeast Bureau on cadre theory study: strengthening Marxist-Leninist ideological education is the fundamental method for improving cadres and improving work.

From the beginning of 1950, the senior cadres of the Industrial Department started to have theoretical studies. A total of forty to fifty senior cadres participated in the study, with a maximum of sixty to seventy people. Study meetings were held every Wednesday and Saturday afternoons (initially without the participation of bureau chiefs, but later they were absorbed into the Saturday study meetings), and two evenings were also designated as self-study time. Their study, from the beginning, has never been interrupted except for holidays. From the beginning of 1950 to the beginning of the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement, they studied Chapters 9 and 10 of the "A Short History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)," and in conjunction with this, they studied several articles in "Lenin and Stalin on Socialist Economic Construction" ("On the Tax in Kind," "On the Food Tax," "The Role and Tasks of Trade Unions Under the New Economic Policy," "Stalin on the New Economic Policy and State Capitalism," "The Year of the Great Turn," "On the Tasks of Economic Workers," "New Environment and New Tasks of Economic Construction," etc.). The characteristic of the study during this period was its ability to closely coordinate with the work tasks at that time. In the spring of 1951, after the Central Committee issued the decision (draft) on strengthening theoretical education, they studied the "Communist Manifesto" and "Socialism: Utopian and Scientific" (half a volume). After "July 1" in 1951, in accordance with the instructions of the Central Committee, they studied "Thirty Years of the Communist Party of China." After that, they successively studied the eight requirements for Communist Party members, "On Practice," several articles from "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," and Stalin's "Marxism and Problems of Linguistics." Then the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" Movements began, and the content of the study was changed to studying the policy documents of the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" Movements. After the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" Movements, they studied "On Contradiction" and "Strategic Problems of China's Revolutionary War." The study of Comrade Mao Zedong's philosophical work "On Contradiction" achieved very good results.

What Role Has Theoretical Study Played in Improving Work?

The effectiveness of theoretical study should naturally not be estimated in isolation from other relevant factors, but the role of the theoretical study of senior cadres in the Industrial Department in improving cadres and improving work is obviously not negligible.

In 1950, they studied Chapters 9 and 10 of "A Short History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)" and "Lenin and Stalin on Socialist Economic Construction." The effect of this study was relatively obvious. The valuable experience of the Soviet Union in economic recovery and socialist construction gave the cadres great ideological inspiration and clarified many confused ideas. In the study meetings, they discussed the worker-peasant alliance, the promotion of industrial products and the market, the methods, priorities, and development speed of industrialization, etc. The importance of this study can be seen from the following two facts: First, when studying the Soviet Union's experience in grasping the link of developing commodity exchange between urban and rural areas during the New Economic Policy period, everyone considered the issue of the commercialization of industrial products in Northeast China at that time. At that time, the cost of products in factories and mines was high, attention was not paid to publicity and promotion, the connection between the production departments and department stores was very poor, the styles and colors of the products were not exquisite, and even there was no packaging (some products required buyers to provide their own packaging or use rough straw bags for transportation), thus forming a backlog phenomenon. Everyone raised their understanding of the issue of product commercialization in the study, organized urban and rural market surveys and user visits, and held two special symposiums to discuss product promotion issues. After that, factories and mines began to organize product promotion agencies. This study played a significant role in promoting cadres' attention to commodity circulation. Second, the selling price of industrial products was too high at that time, and many cadres did not understand that continuously lowering the prices of industrial products was the correct policy that must be followed for the development of socialist state-owned industry. They did not understand that violating this policy would lead to a slowdown in the speed of industrial development and affect the consolidation of the worker-peasant alliance. At that time, although some industrial products were urgently needed by the market, they were backlogged due to high prices. For example, sulfuric acid could not be sold due to its high price, which also hindered the development of many industrial sectors. Many comrades, especially some cadres in the management department, due to their lack of understanding of the basic laws of the development of socialist state-owned enterprises, mistakenly believed that high prices could increase national income and "accumulate funds," and therefore refused to lower prices; some cadres also believed that "high profits mean great achievements," or that "market prices have always been like this, why should we lower prices?" Therefore, they could not get through their thinking and were unwilling to lower prices. The prices of fertilizer, soap, and many other products were similar to those of sulfuric acid. After this study, everyone theoretically recognized the great significance of lowering the selling price of industrial products and agreed to lower prices. In addition, the study and discussion of issues such as industrialization steps, development speed, investment and productivity growth rate, and the proportion of industry and agriculture also greatly broadened the horizons of cadres. Some cadres who had transferred from Party and mass work positions to industrial positions began to deeply realize that industrial development also has its inherent laws. The study of opposing the phenomenon of no one being responsible and establishing an economic accounting system was directly related to the work tasks at that time. For example, a comrade responsible for managing capital construction said that when he first started capital construction, he had the supply system thinking of "doing as much as you can with as much money as you have," and only changed this wrong understanding after studying the issue of economic accounting systems in Soviet socialist economic construction.

Another study that achieved significant results was the study of "On Contradiction." This study, due to the help and influence of Comrade Gao Gang's leadership in the study of "On Contradiction" by senior cadres of the Northeast Bureau organs, and due to the unprecedented upsurge in the demand for political theory study by all cadres after the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" Movements, the impact of this study was extremely profound.

In the study of "On Contradiction," everyone successively discussed what the main contradiction in China is currently, what the main contradiction in Northeast China's industry is currently, and the main contradictions in various industrial systems. This made the theoretical study closely combined with practical work. The study of "On Contradiction" lasted for three or four months, followed by the study of "Strategic Problems of China's Revolutionary War." This study clarified in the minds of many leading cadres that in order to do a good job, they must find the main contradiction in their work and concentrate their efforts to solve it. In this way, some ideological understanding problems that had not been solved or had not been completely solved for a long time in the work were resolved, and the level of work was greatly improved. First, on the issue of emphasizing the development of heavy industry or simultaneously emphasizing the development of light industry, some comrades in some light industry departments (such as textiles and chemicals) or some heavy industry departments that are not emphasized for the time being believed in the past that the leadership did not pay enough attention to the industrial sectors under their management. After studying "On Contradiction," they completely resolved their ideological problems. The dispute over the focus of development in the same industrial system, that is, the argument that the leadership "favors one over the other," was also resolved. In order to strengthen capital construction, which has been raised as a major link this year, and in order to strengthen some newly established national defense industry departments, the responsible cadres of many bureaus and divisions happily and smoothly transferred many good cadres, technicians, and skilled workers to other departments. The situation of various departments vying for investment no longer existed. When accepting university graduates who were uniformly assigned this year, the phenomenon of various departments surrounding the minister and vying for more, which occurred in previous years, did not occur. When assigning work, many cadres in the past had the mentality of "willing to engage in production but not in capital construction." After clearly recognizing the importance of capital construction and the significance of why the leadership put capital construction in the first place this year, these mentalities were corrected; moreover, the focus of leadership and the focus of work could be more smoothly shifted from organizing the restoration of production to capital construction this year. That is to say, the overall concept of the responsible cadres of various departments has been strengthened, departmentalism has been overcome, the steps have become more consistent, and the policies of the higher-level leadership have been implemented more smoothly. Second, since cadres understood that they must find the main contradictions in their work and grasp the main links, many cadres began to extricate themselves from the quagmire of bureaucracy, greatly improving work efficiency. There are many prominent examples. Some management bureaus failed to complete their production tasks in the past due to incorrect production leadership methods, but now their work has undergone a significant change. For example, the Mechanical Industry Administration vigorously promoted the "multi-tool and multi-blade cutting method" and "organizing rhythmic production according to instruction charts" in production leadership; the Coal Mine Administration seized the promotion of advanced experiences such as "fast drilling experience," "Xi'an shaft parallel operation method," "Cui Guoshan fast tunneling experience," and "assembly line operation" in capital construction, that is, began to grasp some basic links in capital construction and production leadership, greatly promoting the development of industry. For example, in the construction process of the Fuxin Power Plant, although the leadership also discovered many complex problems, they did not distinguish between the primary and secondary. After studying "On Contradiction," they grasped the main link of accepting advanced Soviet experience, so that the project could be completed ahead of schedule and received praise from Chairman Mao. For example, the management department of the Industrial Department has always been very busy and has many cluttered threads. After studying "On Contradiction," they also learned to grasp the center. Many comrades have realized a truth from their own experience: "If the center of work is not grasped correctly, no matter how much effort is spent, it will not work; if the center of work is grasped correctly, the efficiency will be much higher." In some departments, even everyone has studied their central work. Therefore, the phenomenon of blindly being busy and chaotic has been greatly reduced.

Of course, in the documents studied, there are many documents that cannot be directly linked to practical work. Generally speaking, the effects of theoretical study cannot all be as rapid and direct as "seeing results immediately." However, because the study of Marxist-Leninist ideology has been strengthened and the phenomenon of neglecting political and ideological leadership has been criticized, many cadres have opened their minds and gradually developed the habit of thinking about problems; at the same time, this study has clarified many basic viewpoints in the minds of cadres, that is: we must rely on the working class, rely on the broad masses, and we must learn the advanced technology and management methods of the Soviet Union, and criticize the bourgeois technical conservative and backward ideas and management methods. These are of decisive significance in helping our many leading cadres to run the industry well. Therefore, although the influence of political theory study is sometimes not directly manifested, it is actually very profound. Here is a prominent example of how political theory study has improved work, that is, the Electricity Administration, which was criticized by the Northeast Daily in the 1951 security inspection for neglecting political and ideological leadership, began to show obvious improvements in its work in the second half of the same year. Some responsible comrades of the Electricity Administration initially believed that "just talking about ideology cannot solve practical technical problems," and that the leadership had to emphasize politics because they did not understand technology. He did not fully recognize the role of the mass movement of relying on the working class to develop production. However, after a period of study, he began to get rid of the situation of passively coping with and being busy with affairs, and gradually pondered the key issues in his work. When the power supply became increasingly difficult due to the increasing recovery and development of production, he discovered and seized the key issue of "adjusting the load and saving electricity," and adopted the method of vigorously publicizing and relying on the masses, so that the power load capacity was essentially increased by tens of thousands of kilowatts. Later, he seized the method of "fast maintenance" to give full play to the potential of power equipment. In this way, he deeply realized the great significance of strengthening political and ideological leadership and relying on the masses. From then on, he became an enthusiastic supporter of participating in theoretical study and leading the study of cadres in the bureau. Some other cadres also have similar situations.

Due to the strengthening of political theory study by cadres, the political atmosphere and principles among cadres have been strengthened. Many management bureau chiefs said that the differences of opinion among the departments in their bureaus have been eliminated, the unprincipled disputes in meetings have been reduced or even eliminated, and everyone no longer makes personal problems; some people who believed that the leaders should be solely responsible for not doing their work well have become humble because they read "On Contradiction." The policies of various departments on technical personnel have also been unified, and the erroneous argument of "no matter what kind of cadres they are, good cadres are those who understand technology" has been criticized. The spirit of self-criticism and the enthusiasm for work have also been generally improved.

Since senior cadres studied seriously, it has brought new impetus to the study of cadres participating in the intermediate and primary groups. In the past, the phenomenon of leading cadres arranging work during the cadre study time, which hindered the adherence to the study system, no longer exists. Many senior cadres not only developed the habit of studying and set an example in learning, but also helped everyone answer questions and conveyed the insights they had learned from the senior cadre study meetings or the content of their fulfilling speeches to the bureaus and departments. The cadre studies in the Mechanical Industry Administration, the Electricity Administration, and some other units have been conducted relatively well.

Two Main Experiences

Why can the theoretical study of senior cadres in the Industrial Department achieve significant results? Why has the theoretical study of senior cadres in the Industrial Department not been unable to continue like some other units? At least, the following reasons cannot be ignored.

First, the main leading cadres of the Industrial Department (Comrades Wang Heshou, Lü Dong, An Zhiwen, etc.) have a correct understanding of political theory study and regard it as a component of leadership work that is of the utmost importance. They personally took action and provided important assistance. Because leading industrial production is a very complex and difficult task, and it is a new topic for most cadres, business study is very important. However, while cadres are studying business, they must pay attention to preventing the tendency to neglect politics. As leading cadres, if they do not strengthen their study of Marxism-Leninism, it will be difficult to truly do a good job in leading work. These principles are generally recognized by cadres, but the establishment of a theoretical study system for senior cadres will immediately encounter various obstacles and difficulties. First of all, many cadres feel that "if you don't study business, you can't work, but if you don't study theory, it doesn't matter much." Some people are also infected with the purely technical viewpoint of bourgeois technicians, mistakenly believing that theories and policies cannot solve technical problems, and therefore refuse to study. Secondly, work is busy, and it is difficult to squeeze out time. Many cadres believe that "it doesn't matter if the study task is not completed, but it will be difficult to explain if the work task is not completed." Again, after the study system is established, if the tutoring problem cannot be solved, the interest and enthusiasm for study will also be reduced. To overcome these obstacles and difficulties, the leading cadres must first have the determination. In solving these problems, the main leading cadres of the Industrial Department provided a good example. The ministers and vice ministers took the lead, often participated in the study, and set strict study discipline, and were not allowed to be absent or ask for leave for any reason other than illness, and were not allowed to talk about specific business issues at the meeting. Such a strict system has proven to be completely necessary in the early stages of study. After many people have achieved results in their studies and developed the habit and consciousness of studying, they all acknowledge the help that this strict system has given them. The main leading cadres of the Industrial Department not only helped to select study documents, but also combined the content of the documents with the actual situation in the current work and proposed issues for discussion. Their leadership of the study of senior cadres in the Industrial Department not only guaranteed it in terms of system and time, but also led it in terms of ideology and theory. In this way, the content of the study can closely combine theory and practice and have a high level of ideological awareness.

Obviously, rich content and strong ideological leadership are the most important driving forces for the success of the theoretical study of senior cadres in the Industrial Department. And this point is not easy to solve without the help of the main leading comrades.

Second, the content of the theoretical study of senior cadres in the Industrial Department has closely combined theory and practice, and has given full play to the guiding role of theory in practical work. The experience of the study of senior cadres in the Industrial Department proves that anything that can be linked to the current work and thinking can arouse interest in study and achieve results. The experience of studying relevant documents on Soviet socialist economic construction and studying "On Contradiction" and "On Practice" is the best explanation. In terms of study methods, in addition to reading documents to understand their spirit and essence, the dogmatic erroneous method of rigidly grasping concepts and nouns and circling around words and phrases was resolutely avoided in the study meetings. Instead, efforts were concentrated on discussing many ideological and theoretical issues related to work (for example, what is the main contradiction in this industrial system? Must the acceptance of advanced Soviet production experience also be combined with China's production reality?). The Industrial Department often discussed work methods and leadership methods at study meetings, and sometimes also read out some instruction telegrams from the Central Committee. Some of the telegrams read out were directly related to business (such as instructions on formulating plans), and there were also general instruction telegrams (such as on the Zhang Shunyou incident); during the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" Movements, the content of the study was changed to reading out instruction telegrams from the Central Committee and discussing the policies of the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" Movements. In this way, the content of the theoretical study of senior cadres in the Industrial Department, in many cases, is essentially a combination of the dual content of theoretical study and policy study. In a sense, it is also "business study," because the leadership methods and ideological viewpoints related to business are also frequently discussed here. This relatively lively way of learning has been approved by the vast majority of participants. One bureau chief said: "Our study can be said to be rich in content. It has theory, it has policies, sometimes it also talks about national policies, and sometimes it is linked to the central work within the department. After participating in the study, the vision has been broadened, and the vision will be narrowed without participating. The study meeting also played a good role in the exchange of experience, because all the bureau chiefs participated, and many useful experiences can be heard." Another bureau chief said that this study meeting is "the minister's specific ideological leadership to the people below."

This experience proves that under the current circumstances, the theoretical study of senior cadres does not need to overemphasize the completeness and systematicness of the content for the time being, but should try to obtain help for business work as much as possible. This approach is in line with the current needs.

A strict system and a more flexible learning method also played a certain role. At the meeting, the style of free thinking and free debate was fully developed, and everyone did not feel any restraint, and "they dared to say anything, and it didn't matter if they said it wrong." After the study meeting, the minister often gave a brief report on current affairs and work for fifteen minutes or half an hour. Many comrades often use this opportunity as a brief "meeting." And during the hot summer days, they also stipulated holidays.

The experience of the study of senior cadres in the Industrial Department proves that: First, studying basic theory is the most fundamental way to improve the ideological and work level of cadres. Without the study of basic theory, it is impossible to obtain many obvious achievements. Second, although they are senior cadres with heavy workloads, and although they are in an industrial leading organ with extremely tight work, study time can still be squeezed out. And to do this, it mainly depends on the determination of the leaders. Of course, when everyone truly feels that the study is helpful to their own ideological work, it will be easier to squeeze time.

There are also shortcomings in the theoretical study of senior cadres in the Industrial Department. For example, the documents and content studied lack the necessary planning, and therefore appear to be somewhat scattered; some participants do not pay attention to reading and reading documents, and the leadership has not emphasized the importance of self-study enough. But although these shortcomings exist, the theoretical study of senior cadres in the Industrial Department has undoubtedly provided a relatively successful experience.

    东北人民政府工业部高级干部的理论学习
    许立群
    东北人民政府工业部（以下简称工业部）高级干部的理论学习，坚持了将近三年之久，获得了很显著的效果。参加学习的绝大多数干部，都认为这一学习确实起了很大的作用。这就是：干部的思想水平提高了，工作方法改进了，干部的政治积极性因之也大大增涨了；领导上的方针更容易贯彻了，上下级的步调更趋于一致了，政治理论学习也不再被认为额外负担而被认为是改进工作不可少的项目了。
    将近三年来学习的简略经过
    工业部的高级干部理论学习建立于一九五○年初。当时东北工业生产正处在恢复的紧张阶段。搞工业的干部大部分是一九四八年底和一九四九年初才走上这个新的工作岗位的。虽然也有些干部在根据地里有过一些领导工业的经验，但也没有领导过像当前这样多的近代化厂矿和负担过这样繁重复杂的任务。经过一九四九年初步的民主改革和创造新纪录的群众运动，东北工业生产已开始出现了一个新的面貌。如何建立企业管理上的责任制，逐渐实行严格的计划管理和经济核算制的管理，在这时已是摆在全体干部面前的一个迫切的任务。为了完成这一任务，首先就要求比较负责的干部认真地学习苏联先进的管理企业的理论和经验，改善自己的领导方法。当时在某些高级干部里开始产生了一些严重的问题；这就是“抓住了业务，丢掉了政治”的危险在逐渐滋长。各局、处工作中存在着丧失政治远见的事务主义作风。许多局处长忙碌异常，但抓不住中心，提不出关键问题，经常处于被动应付的状态当中。部内的领导方针很不容易贯彻下去，许多局处负责同志从本位主义出发，强调自己部门或厂矿的重要性，强调自己工作中的困难，抱怨领导上不了解情况。某些搞轻工业的干部对领导上着重发展重工业的方针表示不满，认为轻工业更为提高人民生活水平所急需。有的同志对领导上以某些工业中心为发展重点表示不满，认为领导上不应该“厚于彼而薄于此”。认为资金和干部要得愈多愈好，工作任务、定额却是定得愈低愈好。有的干部认为“谈政治不能把发动机转起来”，有的干部在使用政治面目不清的技术人员时说：“不管什么干部，只要懂得技术就行。”
    在这样情况下，工业部领导上决定加强高级干部的政治理论学习，认真实践中央和东北局关于干部理论学习的指示：加强马克思列宁主义思想教育是提高干部、改进工作的根本方法。
    从一九五○年初起，工业部高级干部学习就建立起来了。参加学习的高级干部共四五十人，最多时有六七十人。每星期三、六下午开学习会（最初无局长参加，后来吸收他们参加星期六的学习会），另外还规定两个晚间作为自修时间。他们的学习从开始起，除了放假，一直未曾中断。从一九五○年初到抗美援朝运动开始这一时期中，他们学习过“联共（布）党史简明教程”第九章和第十章，并配合学习了“列宁斯大林论社会主义经济建设”中的若干文章（“论物品税”、“论粮食税”、“新经济政策下职工会底作用与任务”、“斯大林论新经济政策及国家资本主义”、“大转变的一年”、“论经济工作人员底任务”、“新的环境和新的经济建设任务”等）。这一时期学习的特点是能够紧密地配合当时的工作任务。一九五一年春，中央发布关于加强理论教育的决定（草案）以后，他们学习了“共产党宣言”和“社会主义从空想到科学的发展”（半册）。一九五一年“七一”以后，按照中央指示，学习了“中国共产党的三十年”。在这以后，先后学习了共产党员标准的八项条件，“实践论”，“毛泽东选集”中的几篇文章，斯大林著“马克思主义与语言学问题”。接着“三反”“五反”运动开始了，学习内容改为学习“三反”“五反”运动的政策文件。“三反”“五反”运动以后，学习了“矛盾论”和“中国革命战争的战略问题”。毛泽东同志的哲学著作“矛盾论”的学习，获得了很好的效果。
    理论学习对改进工作究竟起了什么作用
    理论学习的成效，自然不应该离开其他各方面有关的因素来孤立地估计，但是工业部高级干部理论学习在提高干部改进工作上所起的作用，显然是不能忽视的。
    一九五○年他们学习“联共（布）党史简明教程”第九章、第十章和“列宁斯大林论社会主义经济建设”，这一学习的效果是比较明显的。苏联的经济恢复和社会主义建设的宝贵经验，给予干部思想以极大的启发，并使许多糊涂思想澄清。在学习会上，他们曾讨论过工农联盟、工业品推销与市场问题、工业化的方法、重点与发展速度问题等。从下列两件事实中就能看到这一学习获得怎样重要的收获了：第一件，当学习到苏联新经济政策时期抓紧发展城乡商品交流这一环节的经验时，大家考虑到当时东北工业产品的商品化问题。当时厂矿的产品成本高，不注意宣传和推销，生产部门和百货公司联系很差，产品的样式色泽很不讲究，甚至连包装也没有（有些产品要购货人自备包装或用粗劣的草袋装运），因此形成积压现象。大家在学习中提高了对产品商品化这一问题的认识，组织了城乡市场调查和用户访问，并专门开了两次座谈会来讨论商品推销问题。在此以后厂矿才开始组织商品推销机构。这一学习对干部重视商品流转起了不小的推动作用。第二件，当时工业品的售价过高，许多干部不懂得不断降低工业品价格才是发展社会主义性质的国营工业必须遵循的正确方针。他们不懂得：违背了这一方针，就要引起工业发展速度的减慢，就会影响工农联盟的巩固。当时，某些工业品虽是市场所迫切需要的，但由于价格过高，反出现了积压现象。例如硫酸即由于价格过高而推销不掉，因此也阻滞了许多工业部门生产的发展。有许多同志特别是经理部门的某些干部，由于不懂社会主义性质的国营企业发展的基本法则，错误地认为高价可以替国家增加收入，“积累资金”，因而不肯降低售价；也有某些干部认为“利润大、成绩大”，或者认为“市场价格历来就是如此，我们又何必降低售价？”因此打不通思想，不肯降低售价。肥田粉、肥皂和其他许多产品的价格也有和硫酸类似的情况。经过这一学习，大家才从理论上认识了降低工业品售价的重大意义，同意了降低价格。除此以外，在工业化的步骤、发展的速度、投资和生产率的增涨速度、工农业比重等问题的学习和讨论上，也大大扩大了干部的眼界。某些从党群工作岗位上转到工业方面来的干部，开始深切体会到工业发展也有其内在的规律性。至于反对无人负责现象，建立经济核算制等问题的学习，直接联系着当时的工作任务。例如，有一个负责管理基本建设的同志说，刚搞基本建设工作时存在着“有多少钱干多少事”的供给制思想，只在学习了苏联社会主义经济建设关于经济核算制问题之后才改变了这种错误的认识。
    另一个获得显著成效的是“矛盾论”的学习。这一学习由于有高岗同志领导东北局机关高级干部学习“矛盾论”的帮助和影响，又由于“三反”“五反”运动以后全体干部政治理论学习要求的空前高涨，所以，这一学习的影响是极为深刻的。
    在“矛盾论”学习中，大家先后讨论了什么是当前中国的主要矛盾、什么是当前东北工业中的主要矛盾，和各不同产业系统中的主要矛盾。这就使得理论的学习和实际工作密切地结合起来了。“矛盾论”的学习持续了三四个月，紧接着又学习了“中国革命战争的战略问题”。这一学习在许多领导干部思想中明确地了解到：要做好工作，必须找出工作中的主要矛盾，并集中力量把它解决。这样，就解决了工作中若干长期未解决或未完全解决的思想认识问题，并把工作水平大大提高了一步。第一，在着重发展重工业还是同时着重发展轻工业的问题上，某些轻工业部门（如纺织、化工）或某些暂不着重发展的重工业部门中的某些同志，过去认为领导上对自己所管的工业部门重视不够，在学了“矛盾论”之后，才彻底解决了思想问题。在同一产业系统中对发展重点的争论，即认为领导上“厚于彼而薄于此”的议论也解决了。为了加强今年已被提为主要环节的基本建设，以及为了加强某些新建立的国防工业部门，许多局处的负责干部愉快地顺利地把许多好干部、技术人员和熟练技术工人抽调给别的部门。那种为本部门争投资的情况也没有了。今年接受统一分配的大学毕业生时，也没有发生往年各部门包围着部长争着多要的现象。在分配工作时，过去许多干部存在着“愿搞生产不愿搞基本建设”的情绪，在明确认识到基本建设的重要意义，和领导上为什么在今年把基本建设提到首要地位的意义以后，这些情绪就纠正了；而且，领导重点和工作重点在今年就能比较顺利地从组织恢复生产转到基本建设方面来了。这就是说，各部门负责干部的整体观念加强了，本位主义克服了，步调更加一致了，上级领导的方针也贯彻得更顺利了。第二，既然干部理解到必须在自己的工作中找出主要矛盾，抓住主要的环节，就使得许多干部开始从事务主义的泥坑中解脱出来，大大提高了工作效率。突出的例子是很多的，有的管理局过去因为领导生产方法不对头而完不成生产任务，现在工作有了显著的转变。例如机械工业管理局在生产领导上，大力推广“多刀多刃切削法”和“按指示图表组织有节奏生产”；煤矿管理局抓紧了推广“快速钻探经验”“西安竖井平行作业法”“崔国山快速掘进经验”以及基本建设中的“流水作业”等先进经验，也即是开始抓住了基本建设和生产领导中的若干基本环节，大大推动了工业的发展。又如阜新发电厂建设过程中，领导上虽也发现许多复杂问题，但没有分清主次，等到学习“矛盾论”以后，就抓紧接受苏联先进经验这一主要环节，使得工程能够提前完成，得到毛主席的表扬。又如工业部的经理处，从来是事务很繁忙、头绪很杂乱的，在“矛盾论”学习后也学习到抓住中心。许多同志都从自己体验中悟出一条真理：“工作中心抓不对，费的劲再大也不行；工作中心抓对了，效率就要高得多。”在有的部门中，甚至每一个人都研究了自己的中心工作。因此，盲目忙乱的现象就大大减少了。
    自然，在学习的文件中，有许多文件并不能和实际工作直接联系。一般说来，理论学习的效果不能全都像“立竿见影”那样迅速和直接。但是，由于加强了马克思列宁主义思想的学习，批评了忽视政治思想领导的现象，就使得许多干部打开了脑筋，逐渐养成了思考问题的习惯；同时，这种学习在干部思想中明确了许多基本观点，这就是：必须依靠工人阶级，依靠广大群众，必须学习苏联的先进技术和管理方法，批判资产阶级技术上的保守落后思想和管理方法。而这些，对帮助我们的许多领导干部来办好工业是具有决定意义的。因此政治理论学习的影响有时虽然并不直接表现出来，实际上却是很深刻的。这里可以举出由于政治理论学习而提高工作的一个突出的例子，这就是在一九五一年保安大检查时因为忽视政治思想领导受到东北日报批评的电业管理局，在同年的下半年工作上就开始有了显明的改进。电业管理局的个别负责同志在开始时认为“光谈思想不能解决技术上的实际问题”，认为领导上因为自己不懂技术所以只好强调政治。他没有充分认识依靠工人阶级发展生产的群众运动的作用。但经过一定时期的学习以后，他开始摆脱从被动应付、忙于事务的情况，逐渐思索工作中的关键问题。当电力供应因为生产日益恢复发展而感到日益困难时，他发现并抓住“调整负荷、节约用电”这一关键问题，采用大事宣传依靠群众的办法，使电力负荷能力等于在实质上增加几万瓩。后来，他又抓住了“快速检修”的办法使电力设备的潜在力得到巨大的发挥。这样，他就深刻体会到加强政治思想领导和依靠群众的巨大意义。从此，他在参加理论学习和领导局内干部学习上就变成热心的支持者了。另外有些干部，也有和这相像的情况。
    由于干部政治理论学习的加强，干部之间政治空气和原则性加强了。许多管理局长说到他们局内各处的意见分歧消除了，会议上无原则的纠纷减少以至没有了，大家不闹个人问题了；某些认为自己工作做不好只应由领导上负责的人，由于读了“矛盾论”而变得虚心了。各部门对技术人员的方针也一致了，“不管什么干部、懂技术就是好干部”的错误论调受到了批判。自我批评的精神，工作的积极性也都普遍提高了。
    高级干部既然认真学习了，就给参加中级组初级组的干部的学习带来了新的推动力。过去领导干部在干部学习时间布置工作妨碍学习制度坚持的现象不存在了。许多高级干部不仅自己养成了学习的习惯，在学习上以身作则，而且帮助大家解答问题，把自己学习的心得或自己从高级干部学习会上听到的内容充实的发言在局、处内部传达。机械工业管理局和电业管理局以及其它某些单位内部的干部学习，都进行得比较好。
    两个主要经验
    为什么工业部高级干部理论学习能获得显著的效果呢？为什么工业部的高级干部理论学习没有像其它某些单位那样不能坚持下去呢？至少，下列的原因是不能忽视的。
    第一，工业部的主要领导干部（王鹤寿、吕东、安志文等同志）对政治理论学习有着正确的认识，并把它当做领导工作中具有头等重要意义的组成部分。他们亲自动手，并给予重要的帮助。由于领导工业生产是一件十分复杂困难的任务，而对大多数干部来说都是新的课题，因此，业务学习是十分重要的。但是，在干部钻研业务的同时，必须注意防止忽视政治的偏向。作为领导干部来说，如果不加强自己马克思列宁主义的学习，就很难把领导工作真正做好，这些道理，一般干部也都承认，但是要建立高级干部的理论学习制度，马上就会遇到各式各样的阻碍和困难。首先是许多干部感到“不学业务就不能工作，不学理论却没有多大妨碍”。也有些人沾染了资产阶级技术人员的单纯技术观点，错误地认为理论政策不能解决技术问题，因而不肯学习。其次是工作繁忙，时间很难挤出。有许多干部认为“学习任务没有完成，检讨起来不要紧；工作任务没有完成，检讨起来就不好办了。”再次，在学习制度建立起来以后，如果辅导问题不能解决，学习的兴趣和热情也会降低。要克服这些阻碍和困难，首先就要领导干部有决心。在解决这些问题上，工业部主要领导干部提供了良好的范例。部长副部长都以身作则，经常参加学习，并且定下严格的学习纪律，除了生病不得以任何理由缺席或请假，会上不得谈具体的业务问题。这样严格的制度已经证明在学习初期是完全必要的。许多人在学习获得效果，并养成学习的习惯和自觉性之后，都承认这种严格的制度对自己的帮助。工业部的主要领导干部不仅帮助选择学习文件，而且结合文件内容和当前工作中的实际情况，提出讨论的问题。他们对工业部高级干部学习的领导不只是从制度上和时间上给它以保证，而且是从思想方面、理论方面来领导。这样，学习的内容就能够使理论和实际密切地结合起来，并具有高度的思想水平。
    很显然，内容丰富，坚强的思想领导，这是工业部高级干部理论学习获得成效的最重要的推动力。而这一点，如果离开主要领导同志的帮助是不容易解决的。
    第二，工业部高级干部理论学习的内容，做到了理论和实际的密切结合，发挥了理论对实际工作的指导作用。工业部高级干部的学习的经验证明，凡是能和当前的工作、思想有联系的，就能引起学习的兴趣并收到效果。学习苏联社会主义经济建设的有关文件和学习“矛盾论”“实践论”的经验就是最好的说明。在学习方法上，除了阅读文件领会其精神实质以外，在学习会上坚决避免了死扣概念、名词和在字句上打圈子的教条主义的错误方法，而是集中力量来讨论许多和工作有关的思想、理论问题（例如，什么是本产业系统中的主要矛盾？接受苏联先进生产经验是否也必须和中国的生产实际相结合？）。工业部在学习会上经常讨论工作方法与领导方法，有时还宣读中央的某些指示电文。宣读的电报有的是和业务直接有关的（如关于制订计划的指示），也有一般的指示电文（如关于张顺有事件的）；而在“三反”“五反”运动期间，学习会的内容就改变为宣读中央的指示电报和讨论“三反”“五反”运动的政策。这样，工业部高级干部理论学习的内容，在许多时候，实质上是综合着理论学习和政策学习的双重内容。在某种意义上，它也是“业务学习”，因为有关业务的领导方法和思想观点，也在这里被经常讨论着。这种比较活泼的学习方式，已取得绝大多数参加者的赞许。有一位局长说：“我们的学习可说是内容丰富。它既有理论，又有政策，有时还谈到全国大政方针，有时又联系到部内中心工作。参加学习以后眼光扩大了，不参加眼光就会缩小。在交流经验上，学习会也起了很好的作用，因为各局长都参加，可以听到许多有益的经验。”另一位局长说，这个学习会是“部长对下面的具体的思想领导”。
    这一经验证明：在目前情况下，高级干部的理论学习暂时还不必过分强调内容的完整性和系统性，而要尽可能求得对业务工作有帮助。这一作法，是切合当前的需要的。
    严格的制度和比较灵活的学习方式也起了一定的作用。会上充分发挥了自由思想、自由论辩的作风，大家感不到什么拘束，而且“有话都敢说，说错不要紧”。学习会结束以后，部长常以十五分钟或半小时的时间，对当前的时事和工作作简要的报告。许多同志常利用这个机会作为简短的“碰头会”。而天气太热的暑天，他们还规定了假期。
    工业部高级干部学习的经验证明：第一，学习基本理论是提高干部思想、工作水平的最根本的办法。离开了基本理论的学习，就不能获得现有的许多显明的成绩。第二，虽然是工作繁重的高级干部，而且虽然是在工作极紧张的工业领导机关，学习时间仍然是可以抽出来的。而要作到这一点，主要靠领导的决心。自然，当大家真正感到学习对自己思想工作的帮助之后，挤时间就会更容易一些了。
    工业部高级干部理论学习也存在着缺点。例如，学习的文件、内容还缺少必要的计划性，因而显得有些零乱；还有些参加者不注意读书和看文件，领导上对自修的重要性没有作足够的强调。但虽然有这些缺点存在，工业部高级干部的理论学习无疑地已提供了一个比较成功的经验。
