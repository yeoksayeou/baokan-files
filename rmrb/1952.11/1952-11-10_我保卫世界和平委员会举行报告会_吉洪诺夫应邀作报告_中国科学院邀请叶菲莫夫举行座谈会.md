Xinhua News Agency, 9th dispatch: The Chinese People's Committee for the Defense of World Peace held a report meeting on the 9th, inviting Tikhonov, head of the Soviet Cultural Workers Delegation and Chairman of the Soviet Committee for the Defense of Peace, to give a report on "Sino-Soviet Friendship and World Peace." 1,500 cadres from various democratic parties and people's organizations attended.

The report meeting began at 10:00 a.m., presided over by Vice Chairman Chen Shutong. The audience warmly welcomed Tikhonov with prolonged applause, and two members of the Central Song and Dance Troupe presented him with flowers to pay their respects.

In his two-hour report, Tikhonov used poetic language and many vivid examples to describe his impressions of New China, the long-standing and profound friendship between the peoples of China and the Soviet Union, and the strong unity between the peoples of China and the Soviet Union in the cause of defending world peace. Tikhonov said: Just as the soldiers who crossed mountains and rivers during the Long March held torches to illuminate the darkness, China is now carrying out another Long March, and the Chinese people are holding torches of knowledge and culture to illuminate themselves. Soon, the light of wisdom and culture will shine on every small place in China. What we have seen and learned in a short period of time in China is far greater than what we knew in the past. The Chinese people are now liberated and stronger. Tikhonov then listed the similarities between China and the Soviet Union in their struggle for freedom, defense of freedom, and large-scale peaceful construction, to illustrate the deep friendship between the peoples of China and the Soviet Union. He said: This summer, I attended the opening ceremony of the first communist project, the Lenin Volga-Don Canal. The Soviet regime gave people strength, realized their fantasies, and turned the desert into a place with water. I thought of China's Huai River harnessing project, where the people's regime realized the fantasies of the Chinese people. I first went to Central Asia in 1926, but when I went again in 1947, Central Asia had changed. Many schools have been built, and every farmer has electric lights. I see the same premonition in China. How many miracles will happen in China in the future? How rich will China be with the newly discovered treasures? Cities are being built, and China is changing. When China's agriculture adopts machinery, China will have a great change. At that time, literature and art will sing the praises of more new figures. Tikhonov said: The construction of our two countries is peaceful and creative construction. Therefore, it is natural that our two countries stand on the front line of peace. Our two great countries are neighbors, and many people's democratic countries surround us and unite with us. The peace and democracy camp is growing stronger day by day, and the imperialist war camp is becoming more and more chaotic. Nothing can help them, and no force can stop the friendship between the peoples of China and the Soviet Union. The friendship and cooperation between the two peoples will develop more and more against the will of all imperialism. Peace will surely triumph, and imperialism will not triumph.

Tikhonov's cordial and enthusiastic speech was repeatedly interrupted by warm applause. After his speech, the audience stood up and gave a storm of applause for up to five minutes, with crowds cheering "Long Live Stalin" and "Long Live Peace".

Xinhua News Agency, 9th dispatch: The Chinese Academy of Sciences invited Yefimov, a member of the Soviet Cultural Workers Delegation and a famous Soviet historian, to hold a symposium with Chinese historical science workers on the 9th. The vast majority of well-known Chinese historians in Beijing attended the symposium, including Tao Menghe, Vice President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences; Fan Wenlan, Director of the Institute of Modern History of the Chinese Academy of Sciences; Zheng Zhenduo, Director of the Institute of Archaeology; Luo Changpei, Director of the Institute of Linguistics; Wu Baosan, Deputy Director of the Institute of Economics; Chen Yuan, President of Beijing Normal University; Jian Bozan, Professor of Peking University; Yin Da, Deputy Director of the Research Department of Renmin University of China; and Liu Dannian, Researcher of the Institute of Modern History of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, totaling more than 40 people. Zhu Kezhen, Vice President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, also attended the symposium.

The symposium was presided over by Fan Wenlan, who first welcomed Yefimov on behalf of Chinese historical science workers. At the meeting, Yefimov made a systematic speech on the general situation of historical research in the Soviet Union, the research of Soviet historians on Chinese history and Oriental history, how Soviet scientific workers conduct collective research, and how Chinese and Soviet historians can strengthen contact in the future. He said that Soviet historians, students and the general public pay great attention to Chinese history, and in recent years the Soviet Union has published and published many books and papers on Chinese history. Yefimov also answered questions raised by Chinese historical science workers on how the Soviet Union trains historical science workers, how the Soviet Union edits scientific history, and other issues.

Chinese historians who spoke at the meeting included Tao Menghe, Zheng Zhenduo, Jian Bozan, and Fan Wenlan. In their speeches, they unanimously pointed out that Chinese historical science workers are in great need of help from the Soviet historical community. Professor Yefimov's speech today has explained to us many things that we are eager to know. They all hoped that the Soviet historical community could continuously send many historians to China to visit and give lectures.

The symposium was filled with an atmosphere of friendship and harmony. Every speaker expressed their sincere enthusiasm to strengthen the great friendship between the peoples of China and the Soviet Union and to strengthen cultural exchanges between the two countries.

Then Yefimov enthusiastically stood up and spoke again. He said that due to his personal experience of being warmly received everywhere during his one and a half months in China, he felt that no force could hinder the development of friendship between China and the Soviet Union.

At the end of the symposium, the seventy-year-old historian Chen Yuan could not help but lead the attendees to shout: "Long Live the Friendship between the Peoples of China and the Soviet Union!" "Long Live Chairman Mao!" "Long Live Stalin!"

    我保卫世界和平委员会举行报告会
    吉洪诺夫应邀作报告
    中国科学院邀请叶菲莫夫举行座谈会
    【新华社九日讯】中国人民保卫世界和平委员会在九日举行报告会，邀请苏联文化工作者代表团团长、苏联拥护和平委员会主席吉洪诺夫报告：“中苏友好与世界和平”。到会的有各民主党派、各人民团体的干部一千五百人。
    报告会在上午十时开始，由陈叔通副主席主持。全场以长时间的鼓掌热烈欢迎吉洪诺夫，中央歌舞团的两个团员并向他献花致敬。
    吉洪诺夫在他的长达两小时的报告中，用诗一般的语句和许多生动的事例，来描叙他对新中国的观感、中苏两国人民之间的悠久深厚的友谊和中苏两国人民在保卫世界和平事业中的坚强团结。吉洪诺夫说：正像长征中翻山越岭的战士拿着火把照亮了黑暗一样，中国现在正进行另一次长征，中国人民正拿着知识与文化的火把照耀着他们。不久之后，智慧和文化之光将照耀着中国的每一个小地方。我们到中国来以后，在短期内所看到和知道的，比我们过去所知道的要伟大得多。中国人民现在已经解放了，更加强大了。吉洪诺夫接着列举中苏两国在争取自由、保卫自由及巨大规模的和平建设中的相同之点，来说明中苏两国人民之间的深厚友谊。他说：今年夏天我参加了第一个共产主义工程列宁伏尔加河—顿河运河的开幕典礼。苏维埃政权给人们以力量，实现了他们的幻想，把沙漠变成了有水的地方。我想到中国也有治理淮河的工程，人民政权把中国人民的幻想实现。一九二六年我第一次到中亚细亚，但一九四七年我再去的时候，中亚细亚就改了样子了。许多学校建立起来了，每家农民都有了电灯。我看到中国也有同样的预感。中国将来要发生多少奇迹。新发掘出来的宝藏将要使中国多么富有。城市在建设着，中国在改变着。等到中国的农业采用了机器以后，中国将要有极大的改变。那时，文学艺术将要歌颂更多的新人物。吉洪诺夫说：我们两国的建设，都是和平创造性的建设。因此，很自然的我们两国都站在和平战线上。我们两大国家是邻居，许多人民民主国家围绕着我们，和我们团结在一起。和平民主阵营一天天强大起来，帝国主义战争阵营一天天更加混乱，没有什么可以帮助它们，没有力量能阻止中苏两国人民的友好。两国人民的友谊与合作，将违反一切帝国主义的意志更加发展起来。和平一定胜利，而帝国主义是不会胜利的。
    吉洪诺夫的亲切热情的讲话，一再为热烈的掌声所打断。在他讲话结束后，全场起立，暴风雨般的掌声历时达五分钟，人群中欢呼“斯大林万岁”、“和平万岁”。
    【新华社九日讯】中国科学院九日邀请苏联文化工作者代表团团员、苏联著名历史学家叶菲莫夫和我国历史科学工作者举行座谈会。在北京的我国著名历史学家绝大多数都出席了座谈会，其中包括中国科学院副院长陶孟和，中国科学院近代史研究所所长范文澜，考古研究所所长郑振铎，语言研究所所长罗常培，经济研究所副所长巫宝三，北京师范大学校长陈垣，北京大学教授翦伯赞，中国人民大学研究部副部长尹达，中国科学院近代史研究所研究员刘大年等共四十多人。中国科学院副院长竺可桢也出席了座谈会。
    座谈会由范文澜主持，他首先代表中国历史科学工作者欢迎叶菲莫夫。叶菲莫夫在会上就苏联历史研究工作的一般情况、苏联历史学家对中国历史和东方历史的研究情况、苏联科学工作者怎样进行集体研究、今后中苏两国历史学者如何加强联系等问题作了系统发言。他说苏联历史学家、青年学生和广大的读者都对中国历史极为注意，近年苏联曾出版和发表了许多关于中国历史的著作和论文。叶菲莫夫并在会上解答了我国历史科学工作者所提出的苏联如何培养历史科学工作者、苏联如何编辑科学史等问题。
    在会上发言的我国历史学家有陶孟和、郑振铎、翦伯赞、范文澜等。他们在发言中一致指出中国历史科学工作者非常需要苏联史学界的帮助。今天叶菲莫夫教授的讲话，就给我们说明了许多我们急于要知道的东西。他们都希望苏联史学界能源源不绝地派许多历史学家到我国来访问、讲学。
    座谈会洋溢着友好、和谐的空气。每个发言者都以衷心的热情表示要加强中苏两国人民伟大友谊，加强两国的文化交流。
    接着叶菲莫夫又热情地起立讲话。他说由于他到中国来一个半月处处受到热烈招待的亲身体验，他感觉到没有任何力量能够阻碍中苏两国友谊的发展。
    座谈会结束时，七十多岁历史学家陈垣曾情不自禁地率领到会者高呼：“中苏两国人民友谊万岁！”“毛主席万岁！”“斯大林万岁！”
