Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, November 5th: The Yoshida reactionary new cabinet, characterized by actively promoting the US policy of reviving Japanese militarism, issued a policy statement on October 31st after its formation. Although the statement tried its best to sing a high-pitched tune of "independent state," it could not hide the reactionary face of the new cabinet's determination to continue to depend on US imperialism and antagonize the people of the world and the Japanese people.

In terms of foreign policy, the statement stated that the new cabinet "will strive to strengthen ties with the democratic and free world." According to Agence France-Presse, quoting a "Tokyo political observer," this means continuing to implement "Yoshida diplomacy" and "close political cooperation with the United States." The statement indicated that the new cabinet will openly abandon the international agreements on purging Japanese militarism, stating that "some of the domestic measures implemented during the occupation have become outdated" and are not suitable for Japan's "needs" today. United Press reported on October 30th that the so-called "cancellation of certain measures during the occupation" is to further lift the purge of militarist elements, release war criminals, restore the financial cliques that were once dispersed after the war, and encourage rearmament and the revival of the arms industry. According to Kyodo News, when compiling the supplementary budget for this fiscal year, the new cabinet will inherit the "50 billion yen supplementary budget policy" used by former Finance Minister Hayato Ikeda to reorganize armaments, and will "gradually strengthen defense capabilities based on the US-Japan Security Treaty" when preparing the budget for the next fiscal year. The statement openly stated that it will step up the suppression of the Japanese people's movement for independence, peace, and democracy, saying that the new Yoshida cabinet is "fully prepared" to "maintain peace and order." Kyodo News explained that the new cabinet will "use the Subversive Activities Prevention Law to consolidate domestic security" in the future.

    吉田反动新阁发表政策声明
    决继续依附美国与人民为敌
    【新华社五日讯】东京消息，以积极推行美国复活日本军国主义政策为特色的吉田反动新内阁组成后，在十月三十一日发表了一篇政策声明。声明虽然竭力唱出“独立国家”的高调，但却一点也不能掩盖新内阁决心继续依附美帝国主义而与世界人民和日本人民为敌的反动面目。
    在外交政策方面，声明表示新内阁“将要极力加强与民主自由世界的联系”，据法新社引“东京政治观察家”的话说，这就是要继续执行“吉田外交”，“与美国实行密切的政治合作”。声明表示新内阁将公开背弃关于肃清日本军国主义的国际协议，声明说：“在占领期间所实行的国内措施有些已经过时”，不适合今天日本的“需要”。合众社在十月三十日即已透露，所谓“取消某些占领期间的措施”，就是要进一步解除对军国主义分子的整肃，释放战犯，恢复战后一度被分散的财阀机构，鼓励重新武装和复活军火工业。又据共同社透露，新内阁在编制本会计年度的追加预算时，将继承前任藏相池田勇人用以重整军备的“五百亿元补充预算的方针”，并在编制下一会计年度预算时“根据日美安全条约，逐步加强防御力量”。声明公开表示将加紧镇压日本人民要求独立、和平、民主的运动，说吉田新内阁有“充分准备”来“维持和平与秩序”。共同社对此解释说，新内阁今后要“运用防止破坏活动法，以巩固国内治安”。
