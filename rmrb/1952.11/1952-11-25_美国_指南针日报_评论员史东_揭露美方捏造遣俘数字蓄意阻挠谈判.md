Xinhua News Agency, 24th. U.S. "Compass Daily" commentator Stone reveals that the U.S. fabricated POW numbers to deliberately obstruct negotiations.

The American aggressors, in order to shirk responsibility for sabotaging the Korean armistice negotiations, submitted a report to the Seventh United Nations General Assembly regarding the negotiation process, which was full of lies. Stone, a commentator for the American "Compass Daily," wrote in the newspaper on October 24 that this U.S. report shamelessly exposed the U.S.'s behavior of creating contradictory POW numbers to obstruct the Korean armistice negotiations, attempting to cover up the truth.

Stone said: Page seventeen of the U.S. report states that the U.S. "in early April, only screened those prisoners of war who were willing to be interrogated, approximately one hundred and six thousand people..." But the situation the U.S. armistice negotiation delegation told the world on April 27th of this year was not like this.

Stone pointed out: At that time, they told reporters that out of 170,000 prisoners of war, only 70,000 were willing to be repatriated. They also told reporters with great seriousness that out of 100,000 North Koreans, only 52,000 were willing to go home, and out of 20,699 Chinese, only 5,100 were willing to go home. They also told reporters that out of the 16,000 South Koreans who were still classified as enemy soldiers, only 3,800 were willing to return to the enemy, and out of the 37,000 South Korean prisoners of war who had been reclassified as "civilians," only 7,200 were willing to return to the side they originally fought for.

Stone also pointed out: Ridgway himself issued a statement on May 11, saying that the list of 70,000 people willing to be repatriated "could" "increase some names as a result of the re-screening plan." This means that all prisoners had been "screened." Only under re-"screening" could this number change. In the same statement, Ridgway said, "Although it is extremely unlikely that any comprehensive screening will be conducted again, those detained in the Allied POW camps have undergone sufficient partial re-screening to prove that the basic figure of 70,000 will not have a 'large' change." When Ridgway submitted his forty-fourth report to the United Nations on July 11, he said that as a result of "screening," "approximately 70,000 prisoners of war and detained civilians will remain on Geoje Island, awaiting repatriation to the Communist side after the armistice." He continued: "This is the figure reported to the Communist side and must be used as the basis for any future negotiations."

Stone said: Now it can be seen from the new report submitted by the U.S. to the United Nations that Ridgway was very dishonest when he presented these figures.

Stone then pointed out the second contradiction in the U.S. report. The report said that only 106,000 people were "screened," which means that 68,000 people refused to be "screened." The U.S. report said that among these 106,000 people who were "screened," "it was unexpectedly found that only about 70,000 people wished to be repatriated," but the report later said that because the Korean and Chinese sides requested an early estimate, the U.S. military command "added an estimated figure for prisoners of war who had not been screened to the total number of prisoners of war who had expressed their desire to be repatriated during 'interrogation,' resulting in the figure of 70,000." Regarding this estimated figure, the report explained: "In making this estimate, the Allied Command believed that the majority of prisoners of war in the POW camps who refused to be screened wished to be repatriated." But according to the U.S.'s own statement, there were 68,000 people in the POW camps who refused to be "screened." Therefore, the U.S.'s figure of 70,000 POWs to be repatriated appears even more absurd.

The U.S. later proposed an absurd figure of 83,000 POWs to be repatriated. The U.S. report said: "Later, the United Nations Command completed the screening of prisoners who had not been screened before. The results showed that a total of nearly 83,000 people could be repatriated." Stone said: If the 68,000 prisoners of war who refused "screening" were previously included in the total number of 70,000, it is difficult to understand how the results of "screening" these 68,000 people could increase the total number by 13,000.

Stone said: This new figure of 83,000 was announced by Ridgway's headquarters on July 25, but two weeks earlier, his report to the United Nations said that the figure of 70,000 was final and that this figure "must be taken as the basis for any future negotiations," which is truly a great joke.

Stone pointed out: Such arbitrary changes in numbers cannot but make people doubt the reliability of these numbers and the calculation methods. In this regard, it must be pointed out that the new report does not say that representatives of the Red Cross, the United Nations, or neutral countries were invited to supervise the "screening." The report said that the inquiries were conducted by "carefully selected personnel, most of whom were U.S. military personnel," and Chinese prisoners of war were "interrogated entirely by Americans."

Stone concluded: In this way, at the crucial moment of the armistice negotiations, the U.S. military command conducted a kind of extremely important "screening" that had never been conducted before (whether this "screening" complied with the Geneva Conventions is questionable) behind their own little iron curtain in Panmunjom without independent supervision, and came up with a number that caused the agreement to fail when it seemed possible. The number that caused all the trouble was called a final and unchangeable number, but today we know that this is just a product of an estimate and a very incomplete "screening." This incident shows how dangerous it is to let the U.S. military command control the armistice negotiations alone behind their own little iron curtain in Panmunjom.

### 美国“指南针日报”评论员史东  揭露美方捏造遣俘数字蓄意阻挠谈判

    揭露美方捏造遣俘数字蓄意阻挠谈判
    【新华社二十四日讯】美国侵略者为了推卸破坏朝鲜停战谈判的责任，向第七届联合国大会提出了一个满纸谎言的关于谈判经过的报告。美国“指南针日报”的评论员史东十月二十四日在该报上撰文指出，美方这个报告，欲盖弥彰地暴露了美方制造矛盾百出的遣俘数字来阻挠朝鲜停战谈判的无耻行为。
    史东说：美方报告的第十七页上说，美方“在四月初仅仅甄别了那些愿意受询问的战俘，约有十万零六千人……”。但是美方停战谈判代表团今年四月二十七日对全世界说的情况并非如此。
    史东指出：当时他们告诉记者说，在十七万名战俘中，只有七万名战俘愿意被遣返。他们当时还煞有介事地告诉记者说，在十万名北朝鲜人中只有五万二千人愿意回家，在二万零六百九十九名中国人中只有五千一百人愿意回家。他们还告诉记者说，在仍被分类为敌军士兵的一万六千名南朝鲜人中，只有三千八百人愿意回到敌方去，在重新分类为“平民”的三万七千名南朝鲜籍战俘中，只有七千二百人愿意回到他们原来为之作战的一方去。
    史东还指出：李奇微本人在五月十一日发表声明说，愿意被遣返的七万人的名册“有可能”“因实行重新甄别计划而增加一些名字”。这就是说，全部俘虏已“甄别”完毕。只有在进行重新“甄别”的情况下，这个数目才会有所改变。李奇微在同一篇声明中说，“虽然绝少可能再进行任何全面的甄别，但被拘留在联军俘虏营里的人已进行过足够的部分重新甄别，足以证明七万这个基本数字不会有‘大’改变。”李奇微在七月十一日向联合国提出他的第四十四次报告的时候说，由于“甄别”的结果，“约有七万战俘和被拘平民将留在巨济岛，等待停战后被遣返共方”。他接着说：“这就是向共产党方面报告的数字，必须以此作为将来进行的任何谈判的基础。”
    史东说：现在从美方向联合国提出的新报告中可以看出来，李奇微在提出这些数字时是很不老实的。
    史东接着指出美方报告中的第二个矛盾之处。报告说，受“甄别”的只有十万零六千人，那就是说有六万八千人拒绝受“甄别”。美方的报告说，在这受“甄别”的十万六千人中，“出乎意料地发现只有七万人左右希望被遣返”，但是报告后来又说，由于朝中方面要求早日提出一个概数，美军司令部就把在受“询问”中表示要求遣返的全部战俘，“加上对未受甄别的战俘所作的一个估计数字，结果得到七万这个数字。”关于这个估计数字，报告解释说：“在作这个估计时，联军司令部认为在拒绝受甄别的战俘营中，大部分战俘是希望被遣返的。”但是照美方自己的说法，在拒绝受“甄别”的战俘营中就有六万八千人。因此美方的七万遣俘数字就显得更其荒谬了。
    美方后来又提出了一个荒谬的八万三千人的遣俘数字。美方的报告说：“后来联合国军司令部完成了对以前没有被甄别过的俘虏进行的甄别。这个结果表明总共有将近八万三千人可以被遣返。”史东说：假如六万八千名拒绝“甄别”的战俘先前已经包括在七万人的总数中，这就很难理解对这六万八千人进行“甄别”的结果怎能使总数增加一万三千人。
    史东说：这个八万三千的新数字是李奇微总部在七月二十五日宣布的，而在此以前整整两个星期，他给联合国的报告中却说七万这个数字是最后的，并说这个数字“必须被当做今后进行的任何谈判的基础”，这真是滑天下之大稽。
    史东指出：这样随便改换数字不能不使人对这些数字的可靠性及计算方法表示怀疑。在这方面，必须指出，新报告中没有说曾邀请红十字会、联合国或中立国的代表监督进行“甄别”。报告说询问是由“经过慎重选择的人员进行的，其中大部分是美国军事人员”，中国俘虏“完全是由美国人”询问的。
    史东最后说：美军司令部就这样在停战谈判的重要关头，在没有独立的监督的情况下，进行一种从未进行过的极关重要的“甄别”（这种“甄别”是否合乎日内瓦公约是有问题的），作出一个数字，使协议在似乎成为可能的时候归于失败。这个招致
    一切麻烦的数字被称为是一个最后的、不可改变的数字，但今天我们知道这不过是一种估计和非常不完全的“甄别”的产物。这件事说明，让美军司令部在板门店他们自己的小铁幕后面单独掌握停战谈判，是多么危险的事。
