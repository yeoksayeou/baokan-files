    I Have Comprehensively Improved Technology, Making This Year's Cotton Harvest Bountiful
    Comrade Editor: I am from Xiaoyushubao Village, Sixth District, Yixian County, Liaoxi Province. This year, I studied Qu Yaoli's cotton planting experience and comprehensively improved farming techniques. Ten *mu* (Northeast *mu*, each *mu* equals 1.5 *shi mu*) of dryland cotton yielded 3,785.5 *jin*. Among them, 2.2 *mu* were high-yield fields, with an average yield of 687 *jin* of seed cotton per *mu*, exceeding the general yield of this area by four times. Not only was the quantity high, but the quality was also good, with pre-frost cotton accounting for 96.7 percent.
    My high-yield field is acidic, infertile yellow soil, and cotton does not flower well. Last year, I raised five pigs, used sandy soil to pad the pigsty and accumulate fertilizer, and in the summer, I pressed 50 piles of green manure, plus ash, and applied 174 piles of earth manure to the 2.2 *mu* of land. When sowing, I also applied some ammonium sulfate. The seedlings came out and grew vigorously, and were not affected by disease at all. After setting the seedlings, I applied ammonium sulfate again. At that time, there was a thorough rain, and after the fertilizer decomposed, the cotton seedlings grew dark and oily, better than any previous year.
    In the past, I always believed in the saying "cotton turns around and opens up, half a *jin* per plant," so the cotton plants were spaced more than a foot apart, and only 4,107 plants were planted per *mu*. The variety was "Guannong No. 1," and the cotton seedlings were short, so such sparse planting was a waste of land. This year, I increased the number of plants per *mu* to 7,750. This is the main reason for my high yield this year. I was afraid that the cotton would grow wildly, so after setting the plants, I first "took off the pants legs" (removed the lowest leaves); when ten or more fruiting branches had grown, I pinched off the top tips. After another seven or eight days, I pinched off the side tips again. In total, I pinched off the top tips twice, the side tips three times, and the runaway growth once. As a result, each plant grew an average of fourteen mature bolls, and only three and a half *jin* out of a hundred *jin* were post-frost cotton. It is truly unexpected that in our relatively cold area, such a high yield could be obtained. If the Party newspaper had not told me about Qu Yaoli's cotton high-yield experience, my high yield this year would not have been possible. I sold all the cotton to the state to supply factories with raw materials. Next year, I will dig another well, install a Liberation-style waterwheel, and learn from Qu Yaoli's irrigation experience to overcome the threat of drought and increase the yield even more. In addition, I will further improve our mutual aid team.

### 我全面改进了技术，使今年棉花丰收了

    我全面改进了技术，使今年棉花丰收了
    编辑同志：我是辽西省义县六区小榆树堡村人。今年我学习了曲耀离的植棉经验，全面地改进耕作技术，十亩（东北亩，每亩合市亩一亩半）旱地棉花收获了三千七百八十五斤五两。其中有二亩二分丰产田，每亩平均产籽棉六百八十七斤，超过我们这一带一般产量的四倍。不但数量多，质量也好，霜前花占百分之九十六点七。
    我的丰产田是酸性死黄土，种棉花开桃不好。去年我养了五口猪，用沙淤土垫圈积肥，夏天又压了五十堆绿肥，加上草木灰，在二亩二分地里上了一百七十四堆土粪。播种时又上了一些硫酸铔。小苗出来就使上劲啦，一点也没受病。定苗后，又施了硫酸铔。那时下了透雨，肥料分解后，棉苗长得黑油油的，比那年都好。
    过去我总相信“棉花转开身，一棵拣半斤”的话，种的棉株株距有一尺多，一亩只种四千一百零七棵。种的是“关农一号”，棉秧短小，这样稀就白浪费了地力。今年我把每亩增加到七千七百五十棵。这是我今年得到丰产的主要原因。我怕棉花长疯了，定棵以后就先“脱裤腿”（去掉最下部的叶子）；长了十来个结果枝时，就摘了顶尖。再过七、八天，又把侧尖打了。共打了两次顶尖、三次侧尖、一次疯?。结果，每棵平均长了十四个成桃，一百斤才有三斤半霜后花。真是想不到，在我们这比较冷的地方，还获得了这样高的产量。要不是党报把曲耀离的棉花丰产经验告诉了我，我今年的丰产是不可能得到的。我把棉花全部卖给了国家，供给工厂做原料。明年我要再打一眼井，装上解放式水车，学习曲耀离的灌溉经验，克服天旱的威胁，更多地提高产量。另外，我还要把我们的互助组再提高一步。
