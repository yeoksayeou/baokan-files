    The Selection of Model Families of Revolutionary Martyrs and Soldiers is Too Careless in Several Counties of Hunan Province
    Editor: After the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Central People's Government issued the "Instructions on Evaluating Models of Revolutionary Martyrs' Families, Soldiers' Families, Revolutionary Disabled Soldiers, Demobilized Soldiers, and Models of Supporting the Army and Giving Preferential Treatment" on July 11th this year, the People's Government of Hunan Province immediately issued the "Instructions on Evaluating Models of Revolutionary Martyrs', Soldiers', and Workers' Families, Honored Soldiers, and Models of Preferential Treatment in 1952," and issued an order to "comprehensively inspect preferential treatment work" before the "August 1st" Army Day. However, leading cadres in some areas of Hunan Province do not pay enough attention to this work and are perfunctory in its implementation, resulting in the work not being done well and having a very bad impact. For example, Sangzhi County convened a county-wide representative meeting of model revolutionary martyrs', soldiers', and workers' families, honored soldiers, and models of supporting the army and giving preferential treatment on August 19th to evaluate county-wide models of revolutionary martyrs', soldiers', and workers' families, honored soldiers, and models of supporting the army and giving preferential treatment. The county did not conduct good investigations and research beforehand, nor did it follow the instructions of the higher authorities—combining the evaluation with the inspection of preferential treatment work, nor did it first evaluate models in the townships before convening the county-level conference for evaluation. During the evaluation at the conference, they did not prepare sufficient materials either, only generally reporting the "model deeds" in the group meetings before "evaluating." As a result, those who were selected as "models" said: "I don't even know how I got the award." Those who were not selected as models said: "My deeds are no worse than his, why wasn't I selected?" In reality, the real models were not selected. For example, Yang Damei, a soldier's family member from Group 5, Nancha Township, District 3, Sangzhi County, is from a poor peasant background and has 2.5 mu of land. She works hard in production, and her rice seedlings grow very well, recognized as the best in the township, but she was not selected this time. Another example is Zhang Cuili, a volunteer soldier's family member and special-class agricultural labor model from Rucheng County, Chenzhou Prefecture. During the land reform, she was allocated a large paddy field that was flooded (rainwater washes through the field, often washing away fertilizer, making it a very bad field). Because she actively produced, her rice seedlings grew particularly well this year, and she hopes to achieve a thousand-jin yield. However, during the field evaluation, the People's Government of District 3 of the county rated the district's farm as first in order to cultivate the farm, and rated her rice as second, regardless of whether she was a model or not. In addition, similar situations exist in counties such as Yueyang, Lingling, and Yuanling.

    In terms of cultivating models, some area cadres are also very irresponsible. In many areas, models are only selected for the sake of holding labor model conferences, and once the conference is over, they are ignored. For example, Jiang Jinyuan, a special-class labor model from Dong'an County, Lingling Prefecture, was elected in October 1951. After he attended the first Hunan Provincial Agricultural Labor Model Representative Conference, the prefectural office, county, district, and township people's governments never consciously educated and cultivated him, allowing him to become arrogant and detached from the masses.

    In order to implement the evaluation instructions of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Central People's Government, I suggest that the people's governments at all levels in Hunan Province should carefully study the central government's instructions, combine them with the ongoing bumper harvest evaluation movement and the inspection of preferential treatment work, do a good job of evaluation in a planned way, establish preferential treatment banners, and further advance the work of preferential treatment.

### 湖南省若干县份评选烈军属模范工作太不严肃

    湖南省若干县份评选烈军属模范工作太不严肃
    编辑同志：中央人民政府内务部于今年七月十一日发出了“关于评选烈属、军属、革命残废军人、复员军人模范及拥军优属模范的指示”后，湖南省人民政府即发出“一九五二年度评选模范烈、军、工属、荣军及优抚模范的指示”，并在“八一”建军节前发出了“普遍检查优抚工作”的命令。可是湖南省部分地区的领导干部对这一工作重视不够，执行时潦草从事，以致工作没做好，影响很坏。如桑植县在八月十九日召开全县烈、军、工属、荣军及拥军优属模范代表会议，评选全县模范烈、军、工属、荣军及优抚模范。该县事前既未很好调查研究，又未遵照上级指示——结合检查优抚工作进行评选，也未先在乡评选出模范，就召开了县的大会评选。在大会评选时，他们也未准备出充分的材料，仅在小组会中一般地报告了“模范事迹”以后就“评选”了。结果被评上“模范”的说：“我也不知道怎么得的奖”。未被评上模范的说：“我的事迹不比他差，为什么我选不上？”实际上真的模范并未选出，如该县三区南岔乡五组军属杨大妹，贫农成份，有二亩五分田，自己努力生产，她的禾苗生长得很好，全乡公认第一，但这次却没有评上她。再如郴州专区汝城县志愿军家属、特等农业劳动模范张翠理，土地改革时分给她一大丘过水田（下雨水从田中冲过，肥料常被冲光，是极坏的田），由于她积极生产，今年禾苗长得特别好，有希望得到千斤丰产。但在田间评比时，该县第三区人民政府为了培植农场，就将区的农场评为第一，却将她的禾评为第二，不管她模范不模范了。此外，如岳阳、零陵、沅陵等县都有类似情形。
    在培养模范方面，有些地区的干部也很不负责任。很多地区却是为着开劳动模范大会才选了模范，开过会就不闻不问了。如零陵专区东安县特等劳动模范蒋金元是一九五一年十月当选的，他出席湖南省首届农业劳动模范代表大会，回乡后，专署、县、区、乡人民政府从未有意识地对他进行过教育和培养，放任他自高自大，结果脱离了群众。
    为了贯彻执行中央人民政府内务部的评选指示，我建议湖南省各级人民政府要很好地研究中央的指示，结合正在展开的丰产评比运动，和优抚工作的检查，有计划地作好评选工作，树立优抚旗帜，把优抚工作向前推进一步。  尚嘉
