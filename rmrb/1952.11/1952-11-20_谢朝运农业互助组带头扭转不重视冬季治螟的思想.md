    Xie Chaoyun Agricultural Mutual Aid Team Leads in Reversing the Idea of Not Valuing Winter Rice Borer Control
    To the Editor: The Xie Chaoyun Mutual Aid Team in Shizi Township, Leiyang, Hunan, took the lead in eliminating overwintering pests, reversing the farmers' idea of not valuing winter pest control.
    Farmers in Shizi Township used to be skeptical about winter pest control, thinking that digging up rice roots to prevent rice borers was just asking for trouble. In order to break this idea, the people of the Xie Chaoyun Mutual Aid Team took the lead in digging up rice roots, found the pests hidden in the rice roots, and used the facts to publicize to the masses. Team members Chen Shouquan and Chen Liechun used the fact that Yang Ben’guo, a farmer in the township, had his yield reduced by more than half due to rice borers eating his two mu of land last year, to illustrate the importance of pest control. Under the leading influence of the Xie Chaoyun Mutual Aid Team, more than 120 people in the township took action and dug up all the rice roots in more than 130 mu of land in one day.

    谢朝运农业互助组带头扭转不重视冬季治螟的思想
    编辑同志：湖南耒阳石梓乡谢朝运互助组带头除治越冬害虫，扭转了农民群众不重视冬季治虫的思想。
    石梓乡的农民曾经对冬季治虫工作抱着怀疑态度，认为挖稻根防治螟虫是自找麻烦。谢朝运互助组的人们为了打破这种思想，就带头掘稻根，并找出隐藏在稻根中的害虫，用事实向群众进行宣传。组员陈寿泉、陈列春用去年本乡农民杨本国的二亩田被钻心虫吃得减收一多半的事实，说明防治害虫的重要性。在谢朝运互助组的带头影响下，全乡一百二十多人行动起来，在一天内就把一百三十多亩田的稻根全部挖光了。
