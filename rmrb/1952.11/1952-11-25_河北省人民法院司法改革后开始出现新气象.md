    New Atmosphere Begins to Appear in Hebei Provincial People's Court After Judicial Reform
    Editor: Since the Hebei Provincial People's Court launched the judicial reform movement on the basis of the victory of the "Three-Anti" movement, new atmospheres have emerged in various aspects. Cadres who were unwilling to do judicial work or whose thinking was unstable for a long time in the past are now at ease and have become active. Zhang Jingshan, Deputy Chief of the Criminal Court, said: "I will no longer request to be transferred, and I guarantee to obey the organization. In addition to actively taking the lead in doing my job well, I will continue to examine old legal viewpoints and old judicial styles, learn lessons, and improve my work." Comrade Shi Zhicheng from the Inquiry Office said: "After the judicial reform, I got rid of my baggage and dispelled my concerns. I will definitely do a good job in the people's judicial work in the future." After adjusting the organization, improvements have been made in the working methods. Liu Shaonong, Deputy Chief of the Civil Court, rarely went to the countryside to handle cases in the past, but recently he led four cadres, with case files, to go deep into the masses in the countryside to investigate and deal with cases. Subsequently, the Civil Court also organized four groups, carrying more than 170 existing cases, to go to the countryside separately to conduct trials through the masses. In this way, not only can the backlog of cases be cleared, but also the masses can be educated; the master's thinking of supervising judicial staff is established among the masses. Now, work efficiency has also been improved: the "Review Office" with ten cadres handled 100 cases in one week, and they were very careful and meticulous. Among them, Judge Han Xiangzhai handled 17 cases alone. This had never happened before the judicial reform. After strengthening the strength of the People's Inquiry Office, the masses reflected:
    "The provincial court has changed its appearance, and problems are solved quickly." "The attitude of the cadres is better, and it is really easy to talk about problems." The old judicial procedures that were divorced from the masses have been changed: the "service certificate" has been changed to a receipt slip; the "summons instruction" has been changed to a notice; the "mediation record" has been changed to a mediation certificate; and the "detention warrant" and "arrest warrant" have been changed to a note. In this way, it is both simple and popular, and it is also in line with the spirit of thrift. Calculating only the item of "detention warrant" and "arrest warrant," one-quarter of the paper is saved. In addition, from the president to the odd-job workers, everyone has formulated a work plan and put forward guarantee conditions around the overall work center. Under the principle of mutual supervision and mutual learning, cadres often carry out criticism and self-criticism, and the whole hospital is full of a democratic atmosphere. Old legal viewpoints and old judicial styles have become something like "a rat crossing the street, everyone shouting to beat it" among the cadres. Now we are continuing to implement judicial reform and strive to do a good job in the people's judicial work.

    河北省人民法院司法改革后开始出现新气象
    编辑同志：河北省人民法院，在“三反”运动的胜利基础上，开展司法改革运动以来，各方面都陆续出现了新气象。过去不愿作司法工作或思想上长期不稳定的干部，现在安心了，并且积极起来了。刑庭副庭长张静山说：“我不再要求调动工作了，保证服从组织。除积极带头作好工作外，还要继续检查旧法观点、旧司法作风，吸取教训、改进工作。”问事处石志成同志说：“经过司法改革，我丢掉了包袱，解除了顾虑。今后一定作好人民的司法工作。”经过调整机构，在工作方法上有了改进。民庭副庭长刘少农，过去很少下乡办案，最近却领着四个干部，带了案卷，下乡深入群众中去调查处理。接着民庭也组织了四个小组，带着现有的一百七十多件案子，分头下乡，通过群众进行审理。这样，不但可以清除积案，而且教育了群众；在群众中树立了监督司法工作人员的主人翁思想。现在，工作效率也提高了：“复核办公室”十个干部一星期即办案一百件，并且很慎重、细密。其中审判员韩香斋一人即办了十七件。这在司法改革以前是没有过的。加强人民问事处的力量后，群众反映：
    “省里的法院变了样，解决问题快了。”“干部的态度好了，谈问题真痛快。”脱离群众的老一套司法手续已改变：“送达证”改用收到条；“传票批示”改用通知书；“和解笔录”改用和解证；“提票”、“押票”改用便条。这样一来，既简便又通俗，而且也合于节约的精神。仅“提票”、“押票”一项计算，就节约用纸四分之一。另外，上至院长、下至勤杂人员，都围绕着总的工作重心，各自制定了工作计划，提出保证条件。干部们在互相监督、互相学习的原则下，经常开展批评和自我批评，全院充满民主气氛。旧法观点和旧司法作风，在干部中已成为“老鼠过街、人人喊打”的东西了。现在我们正继续贯彻司法改革，为搞好人民的司法工作而努力。  高治安
