Xinhua News Agency, New York, 15th—According to TASS: The Special Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly voted on November 11 on a proposal submitted by India and fourteen other countries regarding the status of Indians in the Union of South Africa. (Note: This proposal requests the establishment of a United Nations mediation committee to arrange and assist in resuming negotiations between India, Pakistan, and South Africa on this issue. The proposal also condemns the policy of racial discrimination implemented by South Africa, and requests the South African government to cease implementing the provisions of the "apartheid law" pending the outcome of the aforementioned negotiations.)

As previously reported, the committee chairman delayed the vote on this proposal for several days because the representatives of the United States, Britain, France, Belgium, and other colonial countries stubbornly tried to remove the part condemning the racial discrimination policy pursued by the government of the Union of South Africa from the proposal. The representatives of these countries also suggested that the delegations of India and fourteen other countries amend certain parts of the proposal.

Mrs. Pandit, head of the Indian delegation, said at the committee meeting: The proposing countries of this proposal have decided not to revise the proposal, because they believe that this proposal only includes the minimum requirements and absolutely necessary suggestions regarding stopping the persecution of Indians within the Union of South Africa. She emphasized that it is necessary to establish a mediation committee in accordance with the provisions of the proposal to assist in arranging negotiations between the Union of South Africa and India and Pakistan.

When the proposal was voted on item by item, an overwhelming majority in the committee agreed to the entire content of the proposal. Forty-one delegations, including the delegations of the Soviet Union, Ukraine, Belarus, Czechoslovakia, and Poland, voted in favor of the proposal. The representative of the Union of South Africa was the only representative to vote against it. Seeing that most of the representatives took unanimous action, the US representative was also forced to vote in favor of the proposal, although he had stubbornly insisted on moderating the proposal and insisted on deleting the part condemning the South African government's policy of racial discrimination during the discussion.

The representatives of Britain, France, Belgium, and other colonial countries did not dare to vote against the proposal, so they abstained. A total of sixteen delegations abstained. In this way, the representatives of the colonial countries were unable to prevent the committee from discussing the issue of racial persecution of Indians in the Union of South Africa, nor were they able to prevent the passage of the proposal condemning the racial discrimination policy of the Union of South Africa.

### 联合国大会特别政治委员会  通过印度等国谴责南非联邦种族歧视提案

    联合国大会特别政治委员会
    通过印度等国谴责南非联邦种族歧视提案
    【新华社十五日讯】据塔斯社纽约讯：联合国大会特别政治委员会于十一月十一日表决印度和十四个其他国家提出的关于南非联邦的印度人地位问题的提案。（按：这个提案要求成立一个联合国斡旋委员会来布置与协助恢复印度、巴基斯坦和南非间关于这个问题的谈判。提案并谴责南非所实行的种族歧视政策，要求南非政府停止实施“种族隔离法”的条款，以等待上述谈判的结果。）
    前已报道，由于美国、英国、法国、比利时及其他殖民国家的代表顽固地力图把谴责南非联邦政府所奉行的种族歧视政策部分从提案中删去，使委员会主席延迟几天才表决这个提案。这些国家的代表还建议印度和十四个其他国家的代表团修改提案中的某些地方。
    印度代表团团长潘迪特夫人在委员会会议上说：这个提案的提案国已经决定不修正这个提案，因为它们认为这个提案只包括关于停止对南非联邦境内印度人的迫害的最低要求和绝对必要的建议。她着重指出：有必要按照提案的规定，成立一个斡旋委员会来协助安排南非联邦与印度和巴基斯坦之间的谈判。
    当提案逐项进行表决时，委员会中的压倒多数同意提案全部内容。四十一个代表团，包括苏联、乌克兰、白俄罗斯、捷克斯洛伐克和波兰的代表团，都投票赞成这个提案。南非联邦代表是唯一投反对票的代表。美国代表看到大多数代表采取一致行动，也被迫投票赞成这个提案，虽然在讨论时他曾顽固地坚持把这个提案修改得和缓一些，并坚持删去谴责南非政府奉行种族歧视政策的部分。
    英国、法国、比利时及其他殖民国家的代表不敢投票反对这个提案，因此它们弃权。弃权的共有十六个代表团。这样，殖民国家的代表就没有能够阻挠委员会讨论南非联邦对境内印度人实行种族迫害问题，也没有能够阻止通过谴责南非联邦的种族歧视政策的提案。
