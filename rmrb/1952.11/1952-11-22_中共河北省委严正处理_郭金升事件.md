    CCP Hebei Provincial Committee Sternly Handles the "Guo Jinsheng Incident"
    The CCP Hebei Provincial Committee has sternly handled the Guo Jinsheng incident, in which district and village cadres were accused of forcing a person to death. It also called on all levels of agencies throughout the province to continue to deepen the struggle against bureaucracy, focusing on key points, based on the different situations of different departments, in conjunction with current work. The course of the Guo Jinsheng incident is as follows:

    On January 4, 1951, two carters from Dagougezhuang in Renqiu County stayed overnight at Guo Junqing's shop in Nandou Village, Wuqiang County. At night, the carts parked outside the shop were stolen, missing a small set of harnesses and a waist strap. The carters and the shop owner reported to Bai Yichen, the village public security officer, who then reported to Kong Deyun, the director of the village cooperative (and member of the CCP District Committee). When Bai and Kong inquired about the situation with the carters and the shop owner, they learned that Guo Yuzhong (Guo Jinsheng's father, a middle peasant who served as the deputy leader of the village militia) had been to the shop once on the evening of the incident. They suspected that Guo Yuzhong had stolen the harness. The next day, they held a local meeting to find the person who stole the harness using so-called "observational" methods. Coincidentally, Guo Yuzhong was ill and did not attend the meeting. Bai and Kong affirmed that Guo Yuzhong had stolen the harness and reported it to the district. The district then sent Armed Forces Department cadres Li Songfeng and Li Shuangchun to the village for investigation. These two only spoke with Kong Deyun, Bai Yichen, and the shop owner Guo Junqing and affirmed that the report from Bai and Kong was true. On January 9, the district summoned Guo Yuzhong and the shop owner Guo Junqing for interrogation three times. The third interrogator was Liu Tiezhang, the Minister of the District Armed Forces. During the interrogation, Liu demanded that Guo Yuzhong admit to stealing the harness. When Guo denied it, Liu threatened, "If you don't admit it, I'll strip you naked and freeze you outside." (It was the twelfth lunar month at the time). Guo still denied it, so Liu actually went to strip Guo's clothes. At this moment, District Chief Wang Panchi happened to arrive. Wang Panchi did not stop Liu's act of coercion but said to Guo Yuzhong, "If you don't confess, you'll only suffer in vain!" Guo Yuzhong was forced to admit it, and Liu Tiezhang immediately pressed him for the whereabouts of the stolen goods. Guo Yuzhong said, "I really didn't steal it, where am I supposed to get the harness?" Liu Tiezhang became angry and wanted to strip Guo's clothes again. Wang Panchi used both soft and hard tactics, insisting that Guo Yuzhong confess. Guo Yuzhong was forced to confess again and said the harness was under the grass in the shed. The next day, Li Songfeng went to Guo Yuzhong's house to search for the stolen goods, telling Guo Yuzhong as he left, "If I don't find the harness at your house, I'll bring your whole family here, and you'll be sorry!" After Li left, Guo Yuzhong felt he had no way out and committed suicide by jumping into a well. Li Songfeng did not find the stolen goods and indeed brought Guo Yuzhong's wife in. Guo Yuzhong's wife knew that her husband had died and asked to see the body, but the district cadres refused. Later, the district asked Guo Yuzhong's wife to claim the body. Because Guo Yuzhong's death was unclear, Guo Yuzhong's wife refused to claim the body.

    On January 13, 1951, Guo Yuzhong's wife filed a complaint with the Wuqiang County People's Court. The county People's Court did not accept the case, so Guo Yuzhong's wife called her son Guo Jinsheng (a disabled veteran) back from Shenyang. Guo Jinsheng went to the Second District People's Government to request that the case be handled. Wang Panchi said, "The matter is already like this, the district cannot resolve it. Go to the County People's Court!" Guo Jinsheng went to the County People's Court, and County People's Court cadre Zhang Guanghan said, "We are in meetings all day, we don't have time to resolve your problem. Go back and wait!" Guo Jinsheng requested that the carters be summoned to resolve the matter quickly. County People's Court cadre Guo Ping said, "We are currently carrying out the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, we don't have time to deal with your matter. If you want to go, go yourself." Guo Jinsheng took the official letter from the Wuqiang County People's Court and personally went to Renqiu County to summon the carters. However, County People's Court cadres Zhang Guanghan and Guo Ping still used excuses such as "meetings" and "busy work" to avoid handling the matter. In April, Guo Jinsheng went to Baoding to request help from the Hebei Provincial Veterans Affairs Bureau. The Hebei Provincial Veterans Affairs Bureau did not intervene. Guo Jinsheng went to the Provincial People's Government Civil Affairs Department to complain, and the Civil Affairs Department introduced Guo Jinsheng to the Hebei Provincial People's Court. Provincial People's Court cadre Wang Zhen said, "Go back! We will definitely take responsibility for resolving it for you." Guo Jinsheng waited at home for several days but still received no news, so he returned to Shenyang. Half a year later, Guo Jinsheng's mother appealed to the Central Supreme People's Court and called Guo Jinsheng back. Guo Jinsheng went to the Wuqiang County People's Court to inquire, and Guo Ping said, "This matter cannot be handled carelessly, we need to clarify the situation first." He still told Guo Jinsheng to go home and wait for news. On September 10, Guo Jinsheng went to the Hebei Provincial People's Court in Baoding again to ask. Liu Xiaotian, a cadre in the court's inquiry office, said, "It is very far from your place, we cannot clarify the situation. We still need the county to resolve it for you." Guo Jinsheng asked to see the president of the court, but Liu Xiaotian said, "The president is busy with meetings and does not have time. We can just write a letter to the county." In reality, Liu Xiaotian did not follow up and shelved the matter. Because there were no results, Guo Jinsheng went to Beijing and complained to the Supreme People's Court. The cadres of the Supreme People's Court told Guo Jinsheng that the case had been transferred to the Hebei Provincial People's Court for handling and told him to return to Hebei to resolve it. The next day, Guo Jinsheng returned to Baoding from Beijing. The Hebei Provincial People's Court cadres still told him to "wait two days." Hearing this was another delay, Guo Jinsheng transferred to Beijing. The cadres of the Supreme People's Court agreed to write a letter urging the Hebei Provincial People's Court to resolve it quickly. Guo Jinsheng returned to Baoding with the letter from the Supreme People's Court. Provincial People's Court cadre Liu Xiaotian said again, "This time the resolution will be quick, wait two days!" Guo Jinsheng waited two days and went to inquire again, Liu said again, "This time it will take no more than a week, you should go back to the village and wait!" In fact, the Hebei Provincial People's Court waited a month before urging the Hengshui Special District Branch of the Hebei Provincial People's Court (hereinafter referred to as the Hengshui Special District Branch) to handle Guo Jinsheng's complaint. Guo Jinsheng waited at home for more than a month without receiving a letter from the Provincial People's Court and went to the Hebei Provincial People's Court again. A cadre told him, "This time, let the Hengshui Special District Branch represent the first instance, and the problem will be resolved at once." But in fact, there were no instructions to the Hengshui Special District Branch. On October 25, Guo Jinsheng went to the Hengshui Special District Branch to request the handling of the case. The bailiff of the Hengshui Special District Branch did not allow Guo to see the cadres because Guo did not have the judgment of the Wuqiang County People's Court. At this time, he happened to meet President Li Xiaohan, who said, "Because this case involves cadre issues, it needs to be studied by relevant departments before it can be handled." He advised Guo to return to his job and wait for news.

    On November 26, the Wuqiang County People's Court made a judgment on Guo Jinsheng's complaint, stating in the judgment, "The plaintiff Guo Jinsheng's accusation that his father was forced to death under torture is rejected." It also said, "However, the Second District did have threatening and coercive interrogation phenomena during the interrogation and should bear certain responsibilities." Guo Jinsheng did not accept the judgment and appealed to the Hengshui Special District Branch for another judgment. The Hengshui Special District Branch also made a judgment on January 21, 1952, refuting the reasons put forward by Guo Jinsheng with a set of erroneous old legal terms such as "baseless," "insufficient to adopt," and "no need to elaborate." However, the instructions of the Provincial People's Court that "the district set up a private court and conducted threatening interrogation, causing Guo Yuzhong to commit suicide, the responsibility should be investigated and punished" were pushed to the Wuqiang County People's Court for handling.

    Guo Jinsheng, dissatisfied with the first and second instance judgments, went to the Hengshui Special Commissioner's Office People's Supervision Office three times. The Special Commissioner's Office People's Supervision Office only sent letters to the County People's Government and made phone calls to the Wuqiang County People's Supervision Committee to urge them to handle it. The twists and turns caused by these bureaucratic attitudes did not make Guo Jinsheng submit. He believed that the People's Government would fairly resolve the people's problems, and he went to the Supreme People's Court for the fourth time to complain. The Supreme People's Court instructed the Hengshui Special District Branch to investigate and reply. On June 18, 1952, the Hengshui Special District Branch sent the case file and appeal to the North China Branch of the Supreme People's Court. The North China Branch ruled: "Revoke the first and second instance judgments," and instructed the Hengshui Special District Branch to re-examine the case as a first instance, conduct investigations in collaboration with relevant departments, and handle it strictly. Although the Hengshui Special District Branch conducted an investigation, it still did not handle it strictly. To complain about the district and village cadres forcing his father to death, Guo Jinsheng spent a year and a half, from February last year to July this year, traveling back and forth between Wuqiang County and Hengshui Special District more than eighty times, and went to Baoding four times and Beijing four times, visiting eight agencies and traveling more than 22,000 li, but the problem has not been resolved. Finally, Guo Jinsheng found the Hebei Daily reporter group stationed in Hengshui Special District and asked them to quickly help him resolve this problem. The Hebei Daily reporter group immediately conducted an investigation with the Discipline Inspection Committee of the CCP Wuqiang County Committee before exposing the Guo Jinsheng incident.

    The CCP Hebei Provincial Committee attached great importance to the "Guo Jinsheng Incident." As soon as they learned about this matter, they immediately convened a meeting on August 15, attended by responsible party member cadres from the Provincial Committee Discipline Inspection Commission, the Provincial People's Government Supervision Commission, the Provincial People's Procuratorate, the Provincial People's Court, and the Provincial Federation of Trade Unions, the Communist Youth League, and the Women's Federation to study the handling opinions. The meeting resolved to immediately organize an inspection team to go to Wuqiang for further investigation. Then, all relevant personnel were transferred to the province for thorough inspection and serious handling. The agencies and cadres directly related to this incident must make public self-criticisms to recover the negative impact of this incident on the masses. At the same time, it was resolved to educate the broad masses of cadres and people through the serious handling of this typical incident and to continue to carry out the struggle against bureaucracy throughout the province. The meeting also resolved to provide appropriate subsidies to the life of honorary soldier Guo Jinsheng by the government. After the meeting, the Guo Jinsheng Incident Inspection Team, temporarily organized by various departments, set off that night.

    After the inspection team's investigation, the CCP Hebei Provincial Committee convened a meeting of party member cadres from village, district, county, special district, and provincial departments related to the "Guo Jinsheng Incident," and responsible persons from the discipline inspection committees of local districts, cities, and mining areas, and party organizations of the People's Supervision Commission and People's Procuratorate from October 6th to 9th, to make a final decision on the "Guo Jinsheng Incident." Guo Jinsheng also attended the meeting. At the meeting, Zhang Jun, secretary of the CCP Hebei Provincial Committee Discipline Inspection Commission, announced the decisions on the punishments for the errant personnel:

    (1) Liu Tiezhang, Minister of the Armed Forces of the Second District of Wuqiang County, had serious coercive command style and egregious behavior of violating laws and discipline. He set up a private court and personally threatened and coerced confessions, and should bear the direct and primary responsibility for Guo Yuzhong's suicide. It was decided to give him a punishment of probation within the Party for half a year; and it was recommended that the government dismiss him from his post and handle him according to law. (2) Wang Panchi, former District Chief of the Second District of Wuqiang County (currently the Personnel Section Chief of the Wuqiang County People's Government), approved the illegal detention of Guo Yuzhong by district cadres without principle, and not only did he fail to stop the illegal acts of district cadres detaining people, beating people, setting up private courts, and coercing confessions, but he also participated in inducing confessions, and even threatened the deceased's family after the incident without reviewing his mistakes. His mistake was indeed serious. It was decided to give him a punishment of probation within the Party for one year; and it was recommended that the government dismiss him from his post and handle him according to law. (3) Li Songfeng, Armed Forces Department cadre of the Second District of Wuqiang County, did not conduct in-depth investigation and research, listened to one side and believed in one side, resulting in the wrong arrest and detention of Guo Yuzhong. He threatened Guo Yuzhong when he went to Guo Yuzhong's house to find the stolen goods; he illegally detained Guo Yuzhong's wife when he did not find the stolen goods. He should bear some responsibility for Guo Yuzhong's suicide. It was decided to give him a punishment of dismissal from his work within the Party; and it was recommended that he be given a dismissal punishment administratively. (4) Wang Yimin, public security officer of the Second District of Wuqiang County, not only had a serious careless work style, but also, as a public security officer, failed to grasp national laws and regulations, illegally detaining and detaining people. He not only failed to stop the matter of forcing Guo Yuzhong to confess, but also participated in it personally. Therefore, he was given a public warning within the Party; and it was recommended that he be given a major demerit administratively. (5) The Wuqiang County People's Court was indifferent to this major human life case and only rejected Guo Jinsheng's complaint in its judgment, but condoned and ignored the relevant personnel who forced people to death. Therefore, it was decided to give Chang Yongbo, the president of the court, a public warning within the Party; and it was recommended that he be given a major demerit administratively. (6) Sun Shufeng, the former county chief of the Wuqiang County People's Government, knew after this incident occurred that Guo Yuzhong was threatened and coerced to death by district cadres. When the County People's Supervision Committee and the County People's Court put forward their opinions on the handling of cadres, he still did not treat them with a serious attitude, which caused the problem to be unresolved for a long time, resulting in extremely bad effects and consequences. It was decided to give him a public warning within the Party; and it was recommended that he be given a demerit administratively. (7) The Hengshui Special District Branch of the Provincial People's Court had received instructions from the Provincial People's Court, instructing the court to investigate and deal with the responsibility. But they were always irresponsible, emphasizing procedures, and pushing it to the County People's Court for handling. They did not consider the reasons put forward by the plaintiff and the evidence submitted, and made a hasty judgment without in-depth investigation and research. It was recommended that the government order Li Xiaohan, the president of the Hengshui Special District Branch, to make a profound self-criticism and give him strict criticism. (8) The Provincial People's Court said they would deal with the problems of the masses but did not do so, delaying and not handling them. It was recommended that the government, in addition to ordering the leading cadres of the court to make self-criticisms, should give strict criticism to the personnel responsible for handling the case and let them make profound self-criticisms. (9) Guo Jinsheng sold his family property due to his repeated travels to complain. It was recommended that the local government give him appropriate assistance. Guo Yuzhong's body was claimed by Guo Jinsheng for burial. (10) A mass meeting and a cadre meeting were held on the spot to announce the handling of the relevant cadres, and the relevant cadres made self-criticisms and admitted their mistakes. All relevant personnel at the meeting made self-criticisms, expressing their determination to correct their mistakes. Ma Guorui, Deputy Secretary of the CCP Hebei Provincial Committee, also personally spoke at the meeting. He explained in detail why the Communists attach importance to and must attach importance to the interests of the people, and explained what attitude should be taken to treat the problems of the masses and what attitude should be taken to treat the bureaucratic errors of party member cadres. Finally, he explained that bureaucracy had been overcome to some extent in Hebei Province after the "Three-Anti" movement and the study and inspection of relevant documents on the Zhang Shunyou incident; however, the progress in the province was extremely uneven, so it was necessary to continue to deepen the struggle against bureaucracy in conjunction with current work, based on the different situations of different departments. All problems that occur must be carefully investigated and handled, ensuring that every matter has a resolution and every case has an explanation. At the same time, attention should also be paid to discovering models and making timely commendations, so as to truly achieve rewards and punishments, so that everyone can be educated.

    Editor's Note: Liu Xiaotian, a cadre of the Hebei Provincial People's Court, made serious bureaucratic errors in handling the Guo Jinsheng incident and should also be given appropriate punishment or severe criticism.

    中共河北省委严正处理“郭金升事件”
    中共河北省委严正地处理郭金升控诉区村干部逼死人命的事件，并号召全省各级机关结合着当前工作，根据不同部门不同情况，有重点地继续深入展开反官僚主义的斗争。郭金升事件的经过是这样的：
    一九五一年一月四日，任邱县大苟各庄的两个赶大车的投宿在武强县南豆村郭俊卿店里。晚上，卸在店门外的大车，被人偷走了一付小套和一个搭腰。车主和店主便报告村公安员白义臣，白义臣又转报村联社主任孔德云（中共区委委员）。白、孔二人向车主店主了解情况时，听说出事的那天傍晚，郭玉中（郭金升的父亲，中农成分，在村里任民兵中队副）曾到店里去过一次，就怀疑小套是郭玉中偷的。第二天，他们就召开片会，用所谓“察颜观色”的办法，寻找偷套的人。正巧郭玉中有病，没有参加这个会议，白、孔二人就肯定套是郭玉中偷的，并向区里作了报告。区里就派武装部干事李松峰、李双春来村调查。这两个人到村只找孔德云、白义臣和店主郭俊卿问了问，就肯定白孔二人报告的情况是真实的。一月九日区里就把郭玉中和店主郭俊卿传来，前后审讯三次。第三次审讯人是区武装部长刘铁掌。审问时，刘要郭玉中承认偷套的事情。郭不承认，刘就威胁说：“你不承认，扒了你的衣裳，放到外边去冻你。”    （当时正是旧历腊月天气）郭仍不承认，刘就真去扒郭的衣裳。这时，恰巧区长王泮池来了，王泮池并不制止刘的这种逼供行为，反向郭玉中说：“不坦白，白找罪受！”郭玉中被迫承认了，刘铁掌就追问赃物的下落。郭玉中说：“我真没有偷，叫我到哪里去弄套呀？”刘铁掌火了，又要给郭玉中扒衣裳。王泮池又软硬兼施，一定要郭玉中承认。郭玉中再次被迫承认，并说套放在草棚子草底下。第二天李松峰去郭玉中家搜赃物，走时对郭玉中说：“到你家去要是找不出套来，就把你一家子弄来，够你小子呛！”李走后，郭玉中感到走头无路，就投井自杀了。李松峰没搜出赃物，果然把郭玉中的妻子带来。郭玉中妻子知道丈夫已死，就要求看尸首，区干部不允许。后来区里又叫郭玉中的妻子领尸。因郭玉中死得不明不白，郭玉中妻子拒绝领尸。
    郭玉中妻子在一九五一年一月十三日向武强县人民法院提出控告。县人民法院不受理这件案子，郭玉中妻子就把儿子郭金升（残废军人）从沈阳叫回来。郭金升到二区人民政府要求处理这件案子，王泮池说：“事情已经这样，区里解决不了，你到县人民法院去解决吧！”郭金升到了县人民法院，县人民法院干部张光汉说：“这里整天价开会，没时间解决你的问题，你回去等着吧！”郭金升要求把车主传来，以求迅速解决。县人民法院干部郭平说：“现在正搞镇压反革命，哪有时间管你这事呀，要去你自己去。”郭金升就拿着武强县人民法院的公函，亲自到任邱县去把车主传来。但县人民法院干部张光汉、郭平还是用“开会”、“工作忙”等借口来应付，不作处理。郭金升在四月里到保定请求河北省荣军管理局帮助解决，河北省荣军管理局不管。郭金升又到省人民政府民政厅控诉，民政厅就介绍郭金升到河北省人民法院。省人民法院干部王震说：“你回去吧！我们这里一定负责给你解决。”郭金升回家等了几天仍旧没有信息，就回沈阳了。半年以后，郭金升的母亲又上诉到中央最高人民法院，一边又把郭金升叫回来。郭金升又到武强县人民法院去催问，郭平说：“这件事可不能马马虎虎，得弄清情况再说。”仍让郭金升回家等信。郭金升在九月十日又到保定河北省人民法院去问，法院问事处干部刘啸天说：“这里离你处很远，弄不清情况，还得叫县里给你解决。”郭金升要求见院长，刘啸天说：“院长忙开会，没有时间，由这里给县里写封信就行。”其实刘啸天并没催办，把这事搁起来了。郭金升因无结果，随即到北京，向最高人民法院控诉。最高人民法院的干部告诉郭金升已把案子转到河北省人民法院处理，让郭回河北省解决。第二天郭金升从北京回保定。河北省人民法院干部还是让他“等两天”。郭金升一听又是拖，就转车到北京。最高人民法院的干部答应写封信催河北省人民法院赶快解决。郭金升拿着最高人民法院的信又回到保定。省人民法院干部刘啸天又说：“这回解决就快了，你等两天吧！”郭金升等了两天，再去催问，刘又说：“这回最多也不过一星期，你还是回村等着吧！”实际上河北省人民法院隔了一个月，才催促河北省人民法院衡水专区分院
    （下简称衡水专区分院）办理郭金升的控诉案。郭金升回家等了一个多月没见到省人民法院来信，再次到河北省人民法院。有一个干部告诉他：“这回让衡水专区分院代表一审，就一下把问题解决了。”但事实上并没指示衡水专区分院。十月二十五日，郭金升到衡水专区分院请求处理这件案子。衡水专区分院法警见郭没有武强县人民法院的判决书，不让他进去见干部。这时恰巧碰上院长李晓含，李说：“因此案涉及干部问题，还需要有关部门研究后，才能处理。”劝郭回工作岗位等信。
    十一月二十六日，武强县人民法院对郭金升的控告作了判决，判决书中说：“原告郭金升所告其父受刑不过被逼致死予以驳回。”又说：“但二区在审讯中，确有威胁逼供的现象，应负一定责任。”郭金升不服判决，呈请衡水专区分院另判。衡水专区分院在一九五二年一月二十一日也作了判决，对郭金升提出的理由，以“无稽之谈”、“其不足采”、“无待烦言”等一套错误的旧法名词加以批驳。而对省人民法院的“对区私立公堂进行威胁审讯，使郭玉中自杀，应查明责任，予以处分”的指示，却推到武强县人民法院去办理。
    郭金升不服一、二审判决，曾到衡水专署人民监察处去过三次。专署人民监察处也只是给县人民政府去信和给武强县人民监察委员会打电话催办。这些官僚主义所造成的波折，并未使郭金升屈服，他相信人民政府一定会公正地解决人民的问题，他第四次到最高人民法院去控告。最高人民法院指示衡水专区分院查处具复。衡水专区分院在一九五二年六月十八日把卷宗及上诉状送到最高人民法院华北分院，华北分院判决：“撤销一、二两审判决”，并指示衡水专区分院要把这案子重新作为一审，协同有关部门进行调查，严正处理。衡水专区分院虽作了调查，但仍没有严正处理。郭金升为了控诉区村干部逼死他父亲，从去年二月到今年七月，费了一年半的时间，往返武强县与衡水专区共八十多次，又四次到保定，四次上北京，前后到过八个机关，走了两万二千多里路，但问题还没有解决。最后郭金升找到了河北日报驻衡水专区的记者组，要求他们赶快帮助他解决这一问题。河北日报记者组当即和中共武强县委纪律检查委员会进行了调查之后才把郭金升事件揭发出来。
    中共河北省委对“郭金升事件”很重视。他们一知道这件事后，即于八月十五日召集了省委纪律检查委员会、省人民政府监察委员会、省人民检察署、省人民法院和省工会、青年团、妇联等部门负责党员干部开会，研究处理意见。会上决议立即组织一个检查组到武强作进一步的调查。然后把有关人员一齐调省，进行彻底检查，并作严正处理。和这一事件直接有关的机关、干部必须作公开检讨，以挽回这一事件在群众中所造成的恶劣影响。同时决议通过这一典型事件的严正处理，教育广大干部和人民，并继续在全省开展反官僚主义的斗争。会上还决议对荣誉军人郭金升的生活，由政府给以适当补助。会后，各部门临时组织的郭金升事件检查组，当晚即出发。
    经过检查组调查之后，中共河北省委于十月六日至九日，召开了有关“郭金升事件”的村、区、县、专区、省级各部门的党员干部和各地、市、矿区党委纪律检查委员会的负责人和人民监察委员会、人民检察署的党组织的负责人会议，对“郭金升事件”作最后处理。郭金升也出席了这次会议。会上中共河北省委纪律检查委员会书记张君宣布了对犯错误人员的处分决定：
    （一）武强县二区武装部长刘铁掌，有严重的强迫命令作风与违法乱纪的恶劣行为，私立公堂，亲自威胁逼供，对郭玉中的自杀应负直接的主要的责任。决定党内给以留党察看半年处分；并建议政府撤职依法处理。（二）前武强县二区区长王泮池
    （现任武强县人民政府人事科长），无原则地批准区干部非法拘传郭玉中，对区干部扣人、打人、私立公堂、逼供等非法行为不但不加制止，反参与诱供，甚至事后不检讨错误，还威胁死者家属。错误实属严重。决定党内给以留党察看一年处分；并建议政府撤职依法处理。（三）武强县二区武装部干事李松峰，不深入调查研究，偏听偏信，以致错捕错扣郭玉中。在去郭玉中家找赃物时，对郭玉中施以威胁；未找到赃物，又非法拘传郭玉中的妻子。对郭玉中的自杀应负一定责任。决定党内给以撤销工作处分；并建议行政上给以撤职处分。（四）武强县二区公安员王义民，不仅存有严重的粗枝大叶的工作作风，且身为公安人员不能掌握国家法纪，非法拘人扣人，对逼郭玉中口供的事情不但不制止，还亲自参加。因此党内给以当众警告处分；并建议行政上给以记大过处分。（五）武强县人民法院，对此重大的人命案件漠不关心，判决时只将郭金升所诉驳回，但对逼死人命的有关人员，却纵容不管。故决定给院长常永波以党内当众警告处分；并建议行政上给以记大过处分。（六）武强县人民政府前任县长孙树峰，在这一事件发生以后就知道郭玉中是被区干部威胁逼供致死的，县人民监察委员会、县人民法院向其提出对干部处理的意见时，他仍不以严肃的态度对待，以至使问题久悬不结，造成极坏的影响和结果。决定党内给以当众警告处分；并建议行政上给以记过处分。（七）省人民法院衡水专区分院，已接到省人民法院指示，责成该院查明责任予以处理。但总不负责任，强调手续，推到县人民法院去处理。对原告提出的理由和交出的证明不加考虑，又不深入调查研究，就草率判决。建议政府责令衡水专区分院院长李晓含作深刻检讨，并给以严格批评。（八）省人民法院对待群众的问题说了不作，拖延不处理，建议政府除责令该院领导干部作检讨外，对负责办理该案的人员应给予严格批评，并让其作深刻检讨。（九）郭金升为了控诉，往返奔波，致将家产卖掉，建议当地政府予以适当解决。郭玉中尸首由郭金升领回进行安葬。（十）就地召开群众会和干部会议，宣布对有关干部的处理，并由有关干部作检讨，承认错误。会上所有有关人员，都作了检讨，表示要决心改正错误。中共河北省委副书记马国瑞也亲自到大会上讲话。他详细地说明了共产党人为什么要重视而且必须重视人民的利益，说明应以什么样的态度去对待人民群众的问题，用什么态度去对待党员干部的官僚主义错误。最后他说明，河北省经过“三反”运动及对张顺有事件有关文件的学习和检查，官僚主义有所克服；但是在全省进行的极不平衡，因此必须结合当前工作，依据不同部门的不同情况，有重点地继续深入开展反官僚主义斗争。对发生的问题务必认真检查处理，做到件件有着落，案案有交代。同时还要注意发现范例、及时进行表扬，切实做到有惩有奖，使人人受到教育。
    编者按：河北省人民法院干部刘啸天在处理郭金升事件中，犯有较严重的官僚主义错误，亦应给以适当处分或严加批评。
