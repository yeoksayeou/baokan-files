    Editor's Note: Comrade Suslov is a member of the Presidium and Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. This article is his speech at the 19th Congress of the CPSU. He pointed out that the Party must wage an irreconcilable struggle against reactionary bourgeois ideology in carrying out various ideological tasks and in conducting communist education for the working people; at the same time, he pointed out the importance of national education in building socialist culture. This is of great educational significance for our ideological workers and cadres engaged in cultural construction.

    Comrades! The path traversed by our Party from the 18th to the 19th Congress of the Party has been filled with events of worldwide historical significance, filled with events that determined the fate of the Soviet socialist motherland.

    The Leninist-Stalinist Party has victoriously traversed this path, writing new, brilliant pages in its own annals, in the annals of the Soviet state, and in the annals of all mankind, thanks to the correctness of the Party's policy, thanks to the leadership of our Party and all the Soviet people by the genius of mankind, our beloved leader and teacher, Comrade Stalin, with indestructible will and supreme wisdom, along the Leninist path. (Prolonged applause)

    The 19th Congress of the CPSU (Bolsheviks) and Comrade Stalin's new, brilliant work, "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR," presented our country with magnificent prospects for a victorious march towards communism, and once again demonstrated to the whole world the inexhaustible strength and power of the Soviet socialist system, and the indisputable superiority of the Soviet socialist system over the capitalist system.

    The Fifth Five-Year Plan stipulates a new and powerful upsurge in the Soviet national economy, a new stage in establishing the material and technical base of communism. The plan also stipulates huge and important tasks in developing socialist culture, which is what I will discuss in my speech.

    Lenin and Stalin taught us that one of the main conditions for the complete victory of communism is a powerful upsurge in the cultural level and political consciousness of all Soviet people, and the communist education of the working people. As early as 1906, Comrade Stalin pointed out in his famous work "Anarchism or Socialism?" that the future society "presupposes fully developed productive forces and the socialist consciousness of the people."

    In his new classic work "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR," Comrade Stalin made a comprehensive and profound analysis of extremely important issues in political economy, primarily issues related to the gradual transition of Soviet society from socialism to communism. Comrade Stalin illuminated the path and methods of building communism with the brilliant light of Marxist-Leninist science, thereby giving tremendous help to our Party, to all builders of communist society, and to the entire international workers' movement. (Applause)

    In this work, our great leader and teacher once again emphasized that, as one of the prerequisites for preparing the transition to communism, it is necessary "to achieve such a high level of cultural development in society as will ensure the all-round development of the physical and mental powers of its members, that the members of society may be in a position to receive an education sufficient to enable them to become active participants in social development, to be in a position freely to choose their occupations and not be tied because of the existing division of labor, to some one occupation for life."

    That is why the Party Central Committee and Comrade Stalin pay such close attention to the Party's ideological work, and fight tenaciously to do everything possible to improve the communist education of the Soviet people.

    The aim of communist education is to make all working people, especially our youth, people with a high level of culture and education, vigorous, persevering, unafraid of difficulties and obstacles, to educate them in the spirit of a socialist attitude towards labor and public property, in the spirit of ardent Soviet patriotism and proletarian internationalism, and in the spirit of infinite loyalty to the great cause of communism. The communist education of the working people is the most important means of striving for high labor productivity, striving to consolidate socialist labor discipline, striving to consolidate and develop public property, and striving for the further growth of the power of the Soviet state.

    The construction of communism in our country is not progressing in a smooth, "conflict-free" manner, without difficulties or struggles. The so-called "no-conflict" theory, which is quite popular among literary and art workers, is very wrong and contrary to Marxism-Leninism. This theory harms our literature and art, leading them away from the active struggle against the remnants and influence of bourgeois ideology, and away from the active struggle against everything old, decaying, and hindering the Soviet people's advance towards communism.

    First of all, we must not forget the capitalist encirclement led by the most reactionary US-British imperialist groups, who are preparing for a new world war—including ideological preparation. They are using all means of bourgeois culture and thought to numb the broad masses in their own countries, and poisoning the consciousness of individual, insufficiently steadfast elements in our society with the poison of the most vile and insidious lies and slander.

    Our society is not advancing smoothly, but in the struggle of the new against the numerous, still-living remnants of the past, in the struggle against the old, harmful, and sometimes ugly habits and customs inherited from the bourgeois system. Comrade Stalin taught us: "There is always something in our life that is dying. But what is dying does not want to simply die, but fights for its existence, clinging to its already decaying cause."

    "There is always something new growing in our life. But what is growing does not simply grow, but clamors, shouts, and insists on its right to exist."

    "The struggle between the old and the new, the struggle between what is dying and what is newly born, is the real content of the development process."

    Precisely because of this, all the Party's ideological work, the Party's activities in educating the masses in communism, in forming the new, lofty moral and spiritual qualities of our people as members of communist society, cannot be abstract and enlightening. This work and activity should continue to be directed towards waging a relentless struggle against reactionary bourgeois ideology, against the phenomena of this ideology infiltrating our science, literature, and art, overcoming and eradicating the remnants of capitalism in people's consciousness, and strengthening Bolshevik intolerance towards various ideological distortions.

    The construction of socialist culture and the communist education of the working people is an offensive against reactionary bourgeois ideology, an offensive against loafers and thieves of public property, an offensive against bureaucrats and violators of state discipline, an offensive against those who worship reactionary bourgeois culture and the capitalist way of life, an offensive against nationalistic and cosmopolitan distortions that are hostile to Soviet ideas and the friendship of all nationalities, and an offensive against apolitical and ideologically deficient tendencies in literature, art, and science.

    A powerful lever for the construction of socialist culture and the communist education of the working people is national education.

    The Party and the Soviet state show unwavering concern for the education of the broad masses of the people, for their mastery of various cultural achievements. Historically significant achievements have been made in this important cause. Even before the 18th Party Congress, our country completed a genuine cultural revolution. In his report to the 18th Congress of the CPSU (Bolsheviks), Comrade Stalin put forward a new historical task—to make all workers and all peasants cultured and educated people.

    This task is being successfully and steadily implemented. Universal seven-year education has been implemented, and general secondary education and specialized secondary education have been greatly expanded. Extremely significant achievements have been made in expanding and improving higher education. The number of students in institutions of higher learning reached 1.4 million in 1952, 73 percent more than before the war.

    No capitalist country has, and cannot have, national education on this scale. The ruling class needs the ignorance and illiteracy of the working people in order to make them obey themselves and extract the maximum profit through cruel exploitation. National education in the United States is experiencing a deep crisis. In this country, there are more than 10 million illiterates; about one-third of school-age children cannot read. As for secondary education, especially higher education, it is the exclusive possession of the ruling class, and the children of the working people cannot enjoy it.

    The Soviet state spends a large amount of money every year to develop national education, while the US government, in the face of the bankruptcy of national education, allocates less than 1 percent of the budget to this cause. At the same time, military expenditures related to the preparation for a new war account for 74 percent of this year's budget. One percent for national education, and 74 percent for military expenditures! These figures convincingly illustrate the purpose of the anti-people policies of the US ruling class.

    Based on our country's achievements in developing national education, and also taking into account the urgent need of Soviet society to further improve the cultural and technical level of the working people, the directives of the 19th Party Congress on the Fifth Five-Year Plan put forward new and extremely important tasks in national education.

    The draft directives of the 19th Party Congress stipulate: "By the end of the Fifth Five-Year Plan, in the capital cities of the republics, cities directly under the jurisdiction of the republics, central cities of provinces and regions, and large industrial centers, completely transform seven-year education into universal secondary education (ten-year education). Prepare conditions for the complete implementation of universal secondary education (ten-year education) in other cities and rural areas during the next five-year period."

    It can be seen from this that, during this five-year plan and the next five-year plan, the task put forward is the transition to ten-year universal compulsory education.

    The significance and scale of this task, which only a socialist country can undertake, is immeasurable. Putting forward such a task is only possible in a society where the people are the masters, and where concern for the people and for improving the people's material and cultural level is an unwavering principle. Ensuring that our entire young generation can receive secondary education is the most important stage in completing the historical task put forward by Comrade Stalin—to make all working people cultured and educated people. This is also a major step in eliminating the essential difference between mental and physical labor.

    The implementation of ten-year universal compulsory education will also have a huge impact on accelerating the development of the national economy, because the ranks of the working class will be supplemented by more cultured and educated people who can quickly and most effectively utilize and advance the latest technology.

    In the new five-year plan, according to Comrade Stalin's proposal, another great task is put forward in national education. This is to start implementing comprehensive technical education in secondary schools, and to implement the necessary measures for the transition to comprehensive technical education.

    In the new five-year plan, higher specialized education and secondary specialized education will be further developed. In order to enable workers to receive education without leaving production, expand the distribution network of correspondence and night-time higher and secondary specialized schools and ordinary schools.

    Completing the extremely important tasks of the Fifth Five-Year Plan in national education requires the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Higher Education to greatly improve their work, and requires local Party and Soviet organs to carry out huge work in building new school buildings, in training and re-training teachers, in improving the quality of education for students, and in fully preparing and implementing measures aimed at implementing comprehensive technical education.

    The new stage of national education development shown in the Fifth Five-Year Plan will enable the cultural level of the masses to reach a further and huge upsurge, which will be a solid foundation for the more vigorous prosperity of our country's science, technology, literature, and art.

    Comrades! In realizing the tasks of cultural construction and communist education of the Soviet people put forward by our Party, in organizing and mobilizing the Soviet people to complete the economic and political tasks facing the country, publications—newspapers, magazines, and books—have great significance.

    The Soviet people love their publications and make great demands on them. Our publications have grown into a powerful force that actively helps communist construction. Our books and magazines are published in large quantities in dozens of national languages. As for newspapers, the current circulation of "Pravda" alone greatly exceeds the circulation of all newspapers published in Russia in 1913.

    The Fifth Five-Year Plan stipulates a huge increase in our country's publications. This puts new demands on publishing houses and the printing and paper industries.

    What is required of publishing workers is to greatly improve the publishing business, increase the sense of responsibility for the ideological content and printing and binding work of the published books, and eliminate the possibility of publishing ideologically erroneous and shoddy books, which is unfortunately still a common phenomenon.

    At the same time, measures should be taken to unconditionally guarantee the expansion of the printing base of our publishing industry according to plan, to guarantee the supply of modern, highly productive equipment to our publishing industry, and to meet the publishing bureau's need for paper.

    The major tasks facing the Party urgently require all Party organizations to improve their level of ideological and political work, and to eliminate all the huge shortcomings that still exist in this area and that were thoroughly exposed by Comrade Malenkov in his report.

    The various historical resolutions of the 19th Party Congress, Comrade J.V. Stalin's brilliant work "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR," and mobilizing the working people to complete and overfulfill the new five-year plan should become the focus of attention of all ideological and political work of Party organizations at all levels.

    Improving the Party's propaganda work is the main condition for improving the level of ideological work of Party organizations at all levels and for successfully completing all the tasks of the Party in economic and cultural construction.

    The great doctrines of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin are the scientific basis of all the policies of the Communist Party, and the basis of the communist education of the working people. This doctrine illuminates our path to communism. Marxism-Leninism reveals the laws of social development and helps the Party, the working class, and the working people consciously and skillfully use the recognized regularity in order to build communism in the shortest period and under the conditions of the least difficulty, relying on these regularities.

    The Party has created favorable conditions for our cadres to successfully master revolutionary theory. In the period after the 18th Party Congress, the total circulation of Marxist-Leninist classics published in the languages of the Soviet nationalities reached 511 million copies. At present, the most complete and meticulously edited fourth edition of Lenin's Collected Works has been published, and 13 volumes of Stalin's Collected Works have been published, which are inexhaustible treasures of creative Marxist-Leninist thought.

    However, despite a certain spread in the propaganda of Marxist-Leninist ideas, it should be emphasized that we still organize this cause in a way that is not satisfactory.

    While justly criticizing the shortcomings in the organization of the Party's propaganda work, Comrade Stalin pointed out one of the main shortcomings, namely, the lack of teaching materials that enable Communists to have the necessary basic knowledge of Marxist-Leninist theory. Comrade Stalin proposed to create a primary tutorial of Marxism-Leninism for Party members and probationary members. The creation of this tutorial will be of great help to our cadres.

    Carrying out Party education and supervising Communists to have the necessary basic knowledge of Marxism-Leninism is the most important task of all Party organizations. However, the facts show that the necessary supervision of the political study of Communists is almost completely absent. This is another huge shortcoming of the Party's propaganda organizational work, which Comrade Stalin also pointed out. Due to the lack of supervision, many Communists are counted as studying theory on their own, but in reality, as the facts show, they have not carried out any work to improve their ideological and political level.

    The task is to eliminate the phenomena of disorganization, spontaneity, and lack of supervision in the Party's propaganda cause, increase the sense of responsibility of Party organizations at all levels and Communists themselves for political study, and systematically supervise Party members and probationary members to have the necessary basic knowledge of Marxism-Leninism in the entire Party education network. Special attention should be paid to improving the ideological content of propaganda work, resolutely eradicating the dogmatic and bookish study of Marxism-Leninism, and improving the ideological and theoretical level of the courses in all aspects of Party education.

    Comrades! Comrade Stalin pays special attention to all the Party's ideological and political work and cultural construction. It is difficult to cite a department of science, culture, and art, a part of the ideological front, that does not feel the inspiring and guiding role of our great leader and teacher, and does not feel the good influence of his genius thoughts. (Applause)

    This ensures the successful completion of the tasks in cultural construction, communist education of the working people, and the propaganda of the immortal ideas of Marxism-Leninism.

    When our Party holds the 19th Congress, it is unprecedentedly unified, ideologically and organizationally united, and enjoys the infinite trust of all the Soviet people. Under the wise leadership of our great leader and teacher, a giant of science, our beloved Comrade Stalin, the Party will realize the various historical resolutions of the Congress and confidently lead the Soviet people to the complete victory of communism. (Prolonged applause) (Translated from the "Pravda" of October 13, 1952)

### 苏斯洛夫在联共第十九次代表大会上的发言

专栏：

    苏斯洛夫在联共第十九次代表大会上的发言
    编者按：苏斯洛夫同志是苏联共产党中央委员会主席团和书记处的成员之一。本文是他在联共第十九次代表大会上的发言。他指出党在进行各种思想工作、在对劳动人民进行共产主义教育时，必须时刻与反动的资产阶级思想做不调和的斗争；同时他指出国民教育在建设社会主义文化中的重要性。这对我国的思想工作者和从事文化建设工作的干部都有很大的教育意义。
    同志们！我们党在第十八次代表大会到第十九次代表大会这一时期所走过的道路，充满了具有全世界历史意义的事件，充满了决定苏维埃社会主义祖国命运的事件。
    列宁斯大林的党胜利地走过了这一道路，在自己的史册、苏维埃国家的史册和全人类的史册上写下了新的光辉灿烂的篇页，这是由于党的政策的正确，由于人类的天才、敬爱的领袖和导师斯大林同志以不可摧毁的意志和极伟大的智慧领导着我们党和全体苏联人民沿着列宁的道路前进。（长时间的鼓掌）
    联共（布）第十九次代表大会和斯大林同志新的天才著作“苏联社会主义经济问题”，给我国展示了向共产主义胜利行进的宏伟远景，再一次向全世界表明苏维埃社会主义社会制度的无穷尽的力量和威力，表明苏维埃社会主义社会制度对于资本主义社会制度的不可争辩的优越性。
    第五个五年计划规定苏联国民经济新的强有力高涨，它是在建立共产主义的物质—技术基础方面的一个新阶段。计划也规定了在发展社会主义文化方面的巨大和重要的任务，这也就是我在自己的发言里所要谈的。
    列宁和斯大林教导我们说，共产主义完全胜利的主要条件之一，是全体苏联人的文化水平和政治觉悟的强有力高涨，是对劳动人民的共产主义教育。还在一九○六年，斯大林同志便在他的名著“无政府主义还是社会主义？”中指出，未来的社会“是以充分发展的生产力及人们底社会主义意识为前提”。
    斯大林同志在新的经典著作“苏联社会主义经济问题”中，对于政治经济学方面的极重大问题，首先是与苏维埃社会由社会主义逐渐过渡到共产主义有关的问题，作了全面的和最深刻的分析。斯大林同志以马克思列宁主义科学的灿烂光辉照亮了建设共产主义的道路和方法，从而给了我们党、共产主义社会的全体建设者、整个国际工人运动以巨大的帮助。（鼓掌）
    我们的伟大领袖和导师在这一著作中再次着重指出，作为准备过渡到共产主义的先决条件之一，必须“使社会达到这样高度的文化发展，保证社会一切成员全面发展他们的体力和智力，使社会成员能获得足以成为社会发展的积极活动家的教育，能自由地选择职业，而不致由于现存的劳动分工而终身束缚于某一种职业”。
    这就是为什么党中央委员会、斯大林同志这样非常注意党的思想工作，顽强地为尽力提高苏联人民的共产主义教育而斗争的缘故。
    共产主义教育的目的，是使全体劳动人民、首先是我国青年成为具有高度文化和教育、生气勃勃、坚忍不拔、不怕困难和阻碍的人，是以社会主义态度对待劳动和公共财产的精神、以热烈的苏维埃爱国主义和无产阶级国际主义的精神、以对共产主义伟大事业无限忠诚的精神来教育他们。劳动人民的共产主义教育，是争取高度劳动生产率、争取巩固社会主义劳动纪律、争取巩固和发展公共财产、争取苏维埃国家威力的进一步增长的最重要的手段。
    共产主义的建设，在我国并不是以安稳的“没有冲突”的形式进展的，并不是没有困难、没有斗争的。非常错误并与马克思主义列宁主义背道而驰的，是在文学和艺术工作人员中间相当流行的所谓“没有冲突”的理论，这种理论给我们的文学和艺术带来损害，使它们离开反对资产阶级思想的残余和影响的积极斗争，离开反对一切旧的、衰朽的、阻碍苏联人向共产主义前进的事物的积极斗争。
    首先，我们不能忘记最反动的美英帝国主义集团所领导的资本主义包围，这些集团正在进行新的世界大战的准备——其中也包括思想准备，他们正在利用资产阶级文化和思想的一切手段来麻醉自己国内的广大群众，并以最卑鄙而又诡诈的谎言和诽谤的毒药来毒害我国社会中个别的不够坚定的分子的意识。
    我国社会并不是顺当地前进的，而是在新事物跟过去的为数仍多的仍有生命力的残余作斗争中，跟那些从资产阶级制度承继下来的旧的，有害的、有时是丑恶的习惯和风尚作斗争中前进的。斯大林同志教导我们说：“我们生活中总是有什么东西在消亡着。但是消亡的东西，不愿意简单地死去，而要为着自己的生存作斗争，坚持自己已经衰败的事业。
    “我们生活中也总是有什么新东西在生长着。但是生长的东西，不是简单地生长起来的，而是喧嚷着，叫喊着，坚持自己的生存权。
    “旧东西与新东西间的斗争，衰亡着的东西和新产生着的东西间的斗争，——便是发展过程底实在内容”。
    正因为如此，所以党的全部思想工作，党在以共产主义教育群众方面、在形成我国人民作为共产主义社会成员的新的崇高道德和精神品质方面的活动，不能是抽象的，启蒙式的。这种工作和活动今后也应当针对着跟反动的资产阶级思想、跟这种思想之渗入到我国的科学、文学和艺术中的现象进行无情的斗争，克服和根除人们意识中的资本主义残余，加强对各种思想上的歪曲现象的布尔什维克的不可调和性。
    社会主义文化的建设和劳动人民的共产主义教育，就是对反动的资产阶级思想的进攻，对懒汉和公共财产盗窃者的进攻，对官僚主义者和国家纪律破坏者的进攻，对崇拜资产阶级反动文化和资本主义生活方式的人的进攻，对敌视苏维埃思想和各族人民的友谊的民族主义和世界主义的歪曲活动的进攻，对文学、艺术和科学中的不问政治和缺乏思想的倾向的进攻。
    社会主义文化的建设和劳动人民的共产主义教育的强有力杠杆，就是国民教育。
    党和苏维埃国家对于广大人民群众的教育，对于他们掌握文化的各种成就，表现着毫不减弱的关怀。在这一重要事业方面，达到了具有历史意义的成就。还在第十八次党代表大会之前，我国就完成了真正的文化革命。斯大林同志在联共（布）第十八次代表大会上所作的报告中，提出了新的历史任务——使全体工人和全体农民都成为有文化和有教育的人。
    这个任务是顺利地和稳步地实现着。普及的七年制教育实行了，普通中等教育和专门中等教育大大扩展了。在扩展和改善高等教育方面，达到了极重大的成就。高等学校的学生数目，在一九五二年已达到一百四十万人，比战前多百分之七十三。
    任何一个资本主义国家都没有而且也不可能有这种规模的国民教育。统治阶级需要劳动人民的愚昧和无知，以便使他们服从自己，并以残酷剥削的办法榨取最大限度的利润。美国的国民教育经历着深刻的危机。在这个国家里，计有一千万以上的文盲；大约有三分之一的学龄儿童不能读书。至于中等教育，特别是高等教育，则是统治阶级的独占物，劳动人民的孩子是享受不到的。
    苏维埃国家每年支出大量款项来发展国民教育，而美国政府却在国民教育破产的情况下，对这一事业拨款不到预算的百分之一。同时，为了与准备新战争有关的军事支出，今年的拨款却占预算的百分之七十四。百分之一用于国民教育，而百分之七十四用于军事支出！这些数字令人信服地说明了美国统治阶级的反人民的政策的目的何在。
    依据我国在发展国民教育方面所达到的成就，同时也考虑到苏维埃社会在进一步提高劳动人民的文化—技术水平方面的迫切需要，第十九次党代表大会关于第五个五年计划的指示，在国民教育方面提出了新的有极重大意义的任务。
    第十九次党代表大会的指示草案规定：“到第五年计划结束时，在各共和国首都、共和国直辖市、省和边区的中心城市以及大工业中心，把七年制教育完全改为普及中等教育（十年制教育）。为下一个五年期间在其他城市和农村中完全实行普及中等教育（十年制教育）准备条件。”
    由此可见，在这一个五年计划和下一个五年计划期间，提出的任务是过渡到十年制的普及义务教育。
    这个只有社会主义国家才能担负的任务，其意义和规模之大，是无法估计的。提出这种任务，其本身便只有在这样的社会中才有可能，即人民成为主人，而且关心人民、关心提高人民的物质和文化水平是确定不移的法则。保证我国整个年青的一代能够受到中等教育，就是在完成斯大林同志所提出的历史任务——使全体劳动人民都成为有文化和有教育的人——方面的一个最重要阶段。这也是在消灭脑力劳动和体力劳动间的本质差别方面的一大步骤。
    十年制普及义务教育的实现，对于加速国民经济的发展也将有巨大的影响，因为工人阶级的队伍将补充上更加有文化和有教育的人，他们能够迅速地和最有效地利用并推进最新的技术。
    在新的五年计划中，根据斯大林同志的倡议，在国民教育方面还提出了另一个巨大的任务。这便是在中等学校里着手实现综合技术教育，并实行为过渡到综合技术教育所必需的办法。
    在新五年计划中，高等专门教育和中等专门教育，获得进一步的发展。为了使劳动者不脱离生产而受到教育，扩大函授的和夜间的高等和中等专科学校以及普通学校的分布网。
    完成第五个五年计划在国民教育方面的极重大的任务，要求教育部和高等教育部大大改进自己的业务，并要求地方党机关和苏维埃机关在建筑新校舍方面，在训练和再训练教师干部、提高对学生的教育品质方面，以及在全面准备和实行旨在实施综合技术教育的办法方面，都进行巨大的工作。
    第五个五年计划所展示的国民教育发展的新阶段，将使人民群众的文化水平达到进一步的巨大高涨，将是我国科学、技术、文学和艺术更蓬勃的繁荣的牢固基础。
    同志们！在实现我们党所提出的文化建设及对苏联人的共产主义教育的任务方面，在组织和动员苏联人来完成国家面前的经济和政治任务方面，出版物——报纸、杂志、书籍——具有着巨大的意义。
    苏联人民喜爱自己的出版物，并对它提出巨大的要求。我们的出版物已成长为积极帮助共产主义建设的强大力量。我国的书籍和杂志用几十种民族语言大量发行着。至于说到报纸，那末仅仅“真理报”现在的发行数额便大大超过了一九一三年俄国出版的全部报纸的发行数额。
    在第五个五年计划中，规定了我国出版物的巨大增长。这对出版机构以及印刷业和造纸业都提出新的要求。
    要求于出版工作人员的，是大大改善出版事业，提高对所出版的书籍的思想内容和印刷装帧工作的责任心，铲除出版思想错误的和粗制滥造的书籍的可能性，可惜这还是常有的现象。
    同时应当采取措施来无条件地保证按照计划扩大我国出版业的印刷基础，保证供给我国出版业以现代的具有高度生产率的装备并满足出版局对于纸张的需要。
    党所面临的重大任务，迫切要求一切党组织提高自己的思想—政治工作水平，消除在这方面仍然存在的并由马林科夫同志在报告中所揭露无遗的一切巨大缺点。
    第十九次党代表大会各个历史性的决议，约·维·斯大林的卓越著作“苏联社会主义经济问题”，以及动员劳动人民完成和超额完成新的五年计划，应当成为各级党组织的全部思想—政治工作的注意中心。
    改进党的宣传事业，是提高各级党组织思想工作水平和顺利完成党在经济和文化建设方面的一切任务的主要条件。
    马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的伟大学说，是共产党全部政策的科学基础，是劳动人民共产主义教育的基础。这个学说照耀着我们走向共产主义的道路。马克思列宁主义揭示了社会发展的法则，帮助党、工人阶级、劳动人民自觉地和巧妙地利用已认识的规律性，以便依靠这些规律性，在最短时期和最小困难的条件下建设共产主义。
    党为我们干部成功地掌握革命理论，创造了有利的条件。在第十八次党代表大会以后的时期，以苏联各民族语言出版的马克思列宁主义经典著作，其总发行量达到五亿一千一百万册。目前，最完整的和经过缜密编审的第四版列宁全集已经出版，斯大林全集已出版了十三卷，它们是创造性的马克思列宁主义思想的取之不尽的宝库。
    然而，尽管马克思列宁主义思想的宣传有了某种推广，可是应该着重指出，我们把这一事业组织得仍然不能令人满意。
    斯大林同志在公正地批判党的宣传工作组织中的缺点时，指出了主要的缺点之一，就是缺乏使共产党员具备马克思列宁主义理论必要的起码知识的教材。斯大林同志提议为党员和候补党员创作马克思列宁主义的初级教程。这种教程的创作，对于我们的干部将有重大的帮助。
    进行党的教育，以及监督共产党员具备马克思列宁主义必要的起码知识，是一切党组织的头等重要的任务。然而事实表明，对共产党员政治学习的必要的监督，几乎是完全没有的。这就是党的宣传组织工作的另一个巨大缺点，这个缺点斯大林同志也曾指出过。由于缺乏监督，很多的共产党员算作是自修理论，可是实际上，正如事实所表明的，没有进行任何提高自己思想—政治水平的工作。
    任务是在于消除党的宣传事业中的无组织性、自流和缺乏监督的现象，提高各级党组织及共产党员自身对政治学习的责任心，在全部党教育网中有系统地监督党员和候补党员具备马克思列宁主义的起码知识。应该特别注意改善宣传工作的思想内容，坚决根除对马克思列宁主义作教条式的、书呆子式的研究，提高党教育一切环节的课程的思想理论水平。
    同志们！斯大林同志对于党的全部思想—政治工作及文化建设，是亲自特别注意的。很难举出科学、文化和艺术的一个部门，思想战线的一个部分，不感到我们伟大的领袖和导师的鼓舞和指导的作用，不感到他的天才思想的良好的影响。（鼓掌）
    这就保证了顺利完成文化建设、劳动人民的共产主义教育和马克思列宁主义不朽思想的宣传方面的任务。
    我们党在举行第十九次代表大会的时候，已经是空前统一，在思想上和组织上团结一致，享有着全体苏联人民无限的信任。党实现代表大会的各个历史性的决议，在我们伟大的领袖和导师、科学巨匠、衷心敬爱的斯大林同志的英明领导之下，满怀信心地引导苏联人民走向共产主义的完全胜利。（长时间的鼓掌）（译自一九五二年十月十三日“真理报”）
