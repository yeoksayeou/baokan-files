    Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 20th—On the 16th, the U.S. side again killed one of our captured personnel on Koje Island. To cover up their crime, the U.S. POW camp authorities, unusually, announced a fabricated "investigation" result, saying that the POW was killed by "another POW in a grudge fight." But no one will believe this myth. This is not the first time the U.S. side has used the excuse of so-called POW "infighting" to cover up the crime of massacring POWs. On July 9th, the U.S. side, under the name of POW "fighting," injured more than 20 so-called "anti-communist" POWs in the Nonsan POW camp. In the U.S. POW camps, where the special agents of the U.S.-Syngman Rhee bandit gang run rampant, this so-called "infighting" is actually these special agents cruelly killing POWs who resolutely refuse to serve as cannon fodder for the U.S.-Syngman Rhee bandit gang.
    Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 19th—On November 16th, the U.S. side again killed one of our captured personnel in the Koje Island POW camp. General Nam Il, chief representative of our delegation to the Korean Armistice Talks, protested to the other side on the 19th, pointing out that the U.S. side must bear full responsibility for the crime of massacring POWs.
    At the Liaison Officers' meeting on the 19th, the other side expressed regret over the incident of their military aircraft violating the conference area agreement and flying over the Panmunjom conference area on November 14th, and claimed that they would take steps to prevent similar incidents from happening.
    Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 20th—Because the evidence was conclusive, McCarthy, the U.S. chief liaison officer for the Korean Armistice Talks, had no choice but to send a letter to our side on the 19th, admitting that U.S. aircraft violated the agreement and invaded the conference area on November 13th, and as usual, "expressed regret." In just over a month since the U.S. side unilaterally suspended the talks, the U.S. side has had to admit violating the conference area agreement four times. The United States Information Service, not long ago, openly lied, saying that the incidents of our protests against the U.S. side's violations of the agreement, "the results of the investigation found that almost every accusation was untrue." While admitting this incident, the U.S. side tried to reduce its responsibility for violating the agreement, ridiculously saying: This was because the "balloons marking the conference area had fallen due to strong winds, making it difficult for the aircraft to identify the area." In fact, the targets in the conference area were very clear, but U.S. aircraft invaded the area three times in a row in the short half-hour from 12:00 noon to 12:30 noon. Since the U.S. side planned to suspend the talks, it has continuously created violation incidents as many as eight times, including U.S. aircraft invading the conference area, U.S. military shelling the conference area, and distributing insulting leaflets in the conference area. The facts show that the U.S. side, which has no credibility, has never strictly intended to abide by the solemn agreement reached by both parties.

    南日将军抗议美方又杀害我方被俘人员
    美方承认美机连续侵越板门店会场区事件
    【新华社开城二十日电】美方十六日又在巨济岛杀害我方被俘人员一名。为了掩饰自己的罪行，美方战俘营当局破例宣布了捏造出来的“调查”结果，说这个战俘是“在挟怨殴斗中被另一个战俘”打死的。但是这种神话是没有人会相信的。美方用所谓战俘“互殴”的藉口来掩饰屠杀战俘的罪行，这已经不是第一次了。七月九日，美方就曾以战俘“格斗”为名，在论山战俘营打伤所谓“反共”战俘二十多人。在美李匪帮的特务分子横行不法的美方战俘营中，这种所谓“殴斗”，实际上就是这些特务分子残酷地杀害坚决拒绝给美李匪帮充当炮灰的战俘。
    【新华社开城十九日电】十一月十六日美方在巨济岛战俘营中又害死我方被俘人员一名。朝鲜停战谈判我方代表团首席代表南日将军在十九日向对方提出抗议，指出美方必须对屠杀战俘的罪行负完全责任。
    十九日双方联络官会议上，对方对十一月十四日对方军用飞机违反会场区协议飞越板门店会场区的事件表示遗憾，并声称将采取步骤以防止类似事件的发生。
    【新华社开城二十日电】由于证据确凿，朝鲜停战谈判美方首席联络官麦卡塞不得不在十九日致函我方，承认十一月十三日美机违反协议侵越会场区的事件，照例“表示遗憾”。仅自美方中断谈判以来的一个多月内，美方已四次不得不承认违反会场区协议的行为。而美国新闻处不久以前却公开撒谎说，我方抗议美方违反协议的事件，“调查的结果发现几乎每一项指责都是不真实的”。美方在承认这一事件时，又希图减轻其破坏协议的责任，十分可笑地说：这是由于作为会场区标志的“气球已因大风而收落，飞机难以辨明该区”。事实上，会场区的目标非常清楚，而美机在中午十二时至十二时半的短短半小时内却连续三次侵越。自美方有计划地中断谈判以来，连续制造违反协议的事件已达八次之多，包括美机侵越会场区，美军炮击会场区，在会场区内投发侮辱性传单。事实说明：毫无信义的美方对双方达成的庄严协议向来没有严格遵守的意图。
