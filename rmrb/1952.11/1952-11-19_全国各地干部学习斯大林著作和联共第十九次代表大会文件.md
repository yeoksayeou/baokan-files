(Xinhua News Agency, 18th)机关 cadres across the country have universally begun to study Comrade Stalin's great work "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR" and the various documents of the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks).

The local Party committees of the Chinese Communist Party attach great importance to this study, and have carried out universal mobilization and specific arrangements before the study. The Propaganda Department of the Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, in order to enlighten and help cadres study, specially organized five report meetings, with responsible comrades from the Northeast Bureau explaining the spirit and essence of the above-mentioned works and documents. The first report meeting was held on November 15th, with Kai Feng, a member of the Northeast Bureau, explaining Stalin's "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR." 1,500 people attended the report, including cadres from Northeast-level organs, heads of provinces and cities, and county party secretaries. After the meeting, the cadres who listened to the lectures went back to convey the message and promote the study throughout the region. The People's Economic Planning Commission of the Northeast People's Government is also preparing to invite Soviet experts to give special reports during the study. The Propaganda Department of the Northwest Bureau of the CPC Central Committee has convened a forum with more than 30 party members and reporters with higher theoretical levels from the Northwest level and Shaanxi Province and Xi'an City to exchange their experiences in studying the above-mentioned works and documents, and to make enlightening mobilization reports to cadres in various units separately. The CPC Xikang District Committee, the CPC Sichuan Provincial Committee, and the Shanxi Provincial Committee, among others, all had responsible comrades give mobilization reports to cadres. The Chongqing Municipal Committee of the CPC specially convened a meeting of heads of propaganda departments of various districts to make specific arrangements for the study.

In order to concentrate on studying the above-mentioned works and documents conscientiously, all localities have formulated study plans based on actual conditions, and have determined the specific objectives and requirements of the study. The study time is generally one month, while the study time for senior cadres on "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR" is more than two months. The plan of the directly affiliated units of the East China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee stipulates that in November, in conjunction with the activities of "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month," a preliminary reading of Comrade Stalin's speech at the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) and Malenkov's report should be conducted, so that a general understanding of the current international situation, the construction of the Soviet Union, and the construction of the Soviet Communist Party can be achieved; in December, the specific conditions of each unit will be further closely integrated, and in-depth theoretical and policy studies will be carried out focusing on the construction of the Soviet Union and the construction of the Soviet Communist Party, in order to improve cadres' thinking and improve their work methods and leadership methods. In order to allow cadres sufficient time to study the documents, the Study Committee of the Directly Affiliated Organs of the Southwest District has decided to extend the original one-month study period to the end of this year. All units have determined the steps and focus of study according to the nature of their business. The South China Sub-Bureau of the CPC Central Committee stipulates that senior cadres should spend four months studying Comrade Stalin's "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR" and the various documents of the 19th Congress of the CPSU (Bolsheviks), and combine it with the study of Chairman Mao's "On Practice" and "On Contradiction."

In order to ensure the successful completion of this study plan, all localities have emphasized that responsible comrades of all departments must take the lead, be consistent from beginning to end, and lead and help general cadres to study well; all study organizations and study backbones must lead conscientiously. The Study Committee of the Northwest Military and Political Committee requires cadres participating in the senior group study to not only study on their own, but also actively assist the study of the middle group, and give popular explanations to the junior group. The organs that started studying earlier have received preliminary results. After nearly a month of study, the cadres of the Guiyang Civil Affairs Bureau have further recognized the international situation and the superiority of the Soviet socialist system, thus greatly improving their work enthusiasm.

    全国各地干部学习斯大林著作和联共第十九次代表大会文件
    【新华社十八日讯】全国各地机关干部已普遍开始学习斯大林同志的伟大著作“苏联社会主义经济问题”和苏联共产党（布）第十九次代表大会上的各项文件。
    中共各地党委对这次学习十分重视，在学习之前都进行了普遍的动员和具体的布置。中共中央东北局宣传部为启发和帮助干部学习，特别组织五次报告会，由东北局各负责同志讲解上述著作和文件的精神、实质。第一次报告会已于十一月十五日举行，由东北局委员凯丰讲解斯大林所著“苏联社会主义经济问题”。听报告的有东北一级机关干部及各省、市负责人、各县县委书记等一千五百人。会后由听讲的干部分别回去传达，把全区学习推动起来。东北人民政府人民经济计划委员会还准备在学习中邀请苏联专家作专题报告。中共中央西北局宣传部已召集西北一级和陕西省、西安市理论水平较高的党员干部和报告员三十多人举行座谈会，交流学习上述著作和文件的心得，并分头向各单位干部作启发性的动员报告。中共西康区党委、中共四川省委和山西省委等都由负责同志向干部作了动员报告。中共重庆市委员会特地召开了各区宣传部长会议，对学习作了具体布置。
    为集中精力认真学好上述著作和文件，各地都根据实际情况，订出了学习计划，并确定了学习的具体目的和要求。学习的时间一般都是一个月，高级干部学习“苏联社会主义经济问题”的时间则在二个月以上。中共中央华东局各直属单位的计划，规定十一月份结合“中苏友好月”的活动，初步阅读斯大林同志在苏联共产党（布）第十九次代表大会上的演说和马林科夫的报告，对目前国际形势、苏联的建设和苏联共产党的建设等问题，能有一个概括的了解；十二月份将进一步密切结合各单位的具体情况，以苏联的建设和苏联共产党的建设问题为中心，作深入的理论和政策的学习，以达到提高干部思想，改进工作方法与领导方法的目的。西南区直属机关学习委员会为了使干部有充分的时间学习文件，已决定将原定一个月的学习期限延长到今年年底。各单位都根据业务性质，确定了学习步骤和重点。中共中央华南分局规定高级干部以四个月的时间学习斯大林同志所著的“苏联社会主义经济问题”及联共（布）第十九次代表大会上的各项文件，并结合学习毛主席的“实践论”和“矛盾论”。
    为了保证这次学习计划的胜利完成，各地都强调必须各部门负责同志带头，有始有终，领导并帮助一般干部学好；所有学习组织和学习骨干必须认真领导。西北军政委员会学习委员会要求参加高级组学习的干部除自学外，同时积极辅导中级组的学习，并向初级组作通俗的讲解。现学习开始较早的机关已收到初步效果。贵阳市民政局干部经过将近一个月的学习，进一步认清了国际形势和苏联社会主义制度的优越性，因而工作积极性大大提高。
