    US "Compass" Newspaper Ceases Publication Due to Lack of Funds
    According to the Soviet "New Times" magazine, issue 46 of this year: On November 4th, the American independent newspaper "Compass" ceased publication due to lack of funds. This newspaper was one of the few in the United States that dared to tell the truth. When it was founded in May 1949, "Compass" announced its principles regarding advertising, stating that advertising patrons "purchase advertising space in the newspaper to tell their own story, and for no other purpose." This statement was, of course, not to the liking of the Wall Street bosses, because when American monopolists buy advertising space, they also buy the newspaper itself. There have been many such examples of forced closures; American newspapers disliked by Wall Street, such as the "New York Star" and the "PM," have suffered the same fate as "Compass." This fact shows that in the modern capitalist world, individual rights, including the right to freedom of expression, belong only to those who control capital.

    Alarmingly Low Level of Social and Cultural Knowledge in the United States
    According to Agence France-Presse, the American pollster Gallup pointed out at a dinner for writers and journalists in Washington not long ago that Americans read too little, their knowledge is too poor, and the American education system is particularly suited to maintaining this situation. He said that he had conducted a survey at an American university and found that one in four students did not read a single book in an entire semester; five out of six students never read seriously; and what was worse, the teachers did not necessarily read more than their students. Gallup said that although newspapers had extensively publicized the Republican and Democratic Party conventions in July, he found that three out of four Americans did not even know who the vice-presidential candidates were.

    美国“指南针日报”因缺乏经费停刊
    据本年第四十六期苏联“新时代”杂志载称：十一月四日，美国的独立报刊“指南针日报”因经费缺乏而停刊。这个报纸是美国少数敢说真话的报刊中的一个。当它在一九四九年五月创刊时曾宣布“指南针日报”关于刊登广告的原则，它认为刊登广告的顾主“在报纸上购买广告地位旨在讲述自己的事，除此以外无他意义”。这种声明当然不合华尔街老板们的脾胃，因为美国垄断资本家购买广告地位的同时也就是要连报纸本身也购买了去。这种被迫停刊的例子已有过不少，为华尔街所讨厌的美国报刊如“纽约明星报”、“下午报”等都遭到了像“指南针日报”同样的命运。这一事实说明：在现代资本主义世界中，个人的各种权利，包括自由表示意见的权利，只能属于那些掌握资本的人们。
    美国社会文化知识水平惊人低下
    据法新社透露，美国民意测验专家盖洛普不久以前在华盛顿一次作家及新闻界人士会餐会上指出：美国人读书太少，知识太差，而美国的教育制度又特别适合于保持这种情况。他说，他曾经在美国一所大学里举行过一次调查，结果发现每四个学生当中，就有一个学生整整一学期都不看一本书；每六个学生当中，有五个学生从来不曾认真阅读；而更糟糕的是教员们也不见得比他们的学生读得多。盖洛普说：虽然报纸曾经大事宣传共和、民主两党七月间的代表大会，但他发现：每四个美国人当中，竟有三个人还不知道副总统候选人是谁。
