Zhukov said: "The victory of the people's democratic system in China has also created all possibilities for developing the domestic economy and culture. The Soviet people attach great importance to the achievements of the Chinese people and rejoice in the achievements of the Chinese people as the achievements of their closest friends. The 'Sino-Soviet Friendship Month,' which started yesterday, is of great significance for further developing and consolidating the friendship between the Soviet and Chinese people."

Yefimov, a member of the Soviet Cultural Workers Delegation, delivered a speech. He said: "On behalf of the Soviet Cultural Workers Delegation, I warmly congratulate the opening of the Soviet Photo Exhibition. Such exhibitions can promote the relationship between all nationalities and consolidate the friendship between all nationalities. Soviet-Chinese friendship is the most important factor in the international situation, and it can shatter the plans of war instigators. The people of our two countries are busy with peaceful construction and are vigilantly standing on the post of defending world peace. The consolidation and development of this friendship is not only in the vital interests of our two peoples, but also in the interests of all peace-loving people in the world."

Then, a group of Young Pioneers, representing the people of the capital, presented flowers to the representatives of the Soviet people to express their respect.

After Li Jishen, Vice President of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association Headquarters, cut the ribbon, the guests, led by Li Jishen, entered the exhibition hall amidst warm applause to view the pictures.
