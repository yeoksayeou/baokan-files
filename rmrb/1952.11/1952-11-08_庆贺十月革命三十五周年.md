    Congratulatory Telegram from the Central Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League to the Central Committee of the All-Union Leninist Young Communist League of the Soviet Union
    To the Central Committee of the All-Union Leninist Young Communist League:
    On the occasion of the 35th anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution, on behalf of all members of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League and the Chinese youth, please accept our heartfelt congratulations.
    Chinese youth deeply understand that the great victory of the Chinese people's revolution and the brilliant achievements made in the three years since the founding of the People's Republic of China are inseparable from the victory of the Soviet October Socialist Revolution and the sympathy and help of Marshal Stalin and the Soviet people. Chinese youth have always regarded Soviet youth as their role models. The heroic achievements of the Soviet people, especially the Soviet youth, in socialist and communist construction and in the cause of defending world peace are a great encouragement to us Chinese youth. Now, Chinese youth are enthusiastically involved in the national activities celebrating the 35th anniversary of the Soviet October Socialist Revolution and the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month." In the future, we will work harder to enhance the friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people, strive to learn from the Soviet experience in socialist and communist construction, learn from the Soviet youth's high degree of patriotism and internationalism, to meet our country's large-scale economic construction, and strive to strengthen the defense of Eastern and world peace.
    We wish you even more brilliant victories in the cause of building communism and defending peace.
    Long live the eternal and strong friendly alliance between China and the Soviet Union!

    Congratulatory Telegram from the All-China Federation of Trade Unions to the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions.
    To the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions:
    On the occasion of the grand celebration of the 35th anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution, the Chinese working class and working people extend fraternal and warm congratulations to the Soviet working class and working people. Under the leadership of the great Soviet Communist Party headed by Comrade Stalin, the Soviet people have victoriously completed the first post-war Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule, restoring and developing the national economy. The Soviet Union is a beacon illuminating the revolutionary path of the world's people, and a fortress for the movement to defend world lasting peace—it has inspired and continues to inspire the confidence of the people of all countries in their struggle for lasting peace, people's democracy, and socialism. The second post-war Five-Year Plan adopted by the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union has taken the Soviet people another step forward on the road to communism, setting a brilliant example for the people of China and the world, and greatly strengthening their confidence and strength in their struggle.
    The Chinese working class and working people have personally experienced that the generous and selfless assistance provided by the Soviet people to China is a necessary condition for building a new China. The Chinese working class is carrying out a patriotic production increase and thrift campaign on a national scale to welcome the upcoming large-scale construction, and continue to carry out the campaign to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, defending peace in Asia and the world.
    Long live the unbreakable friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union!
    Long live Comrade Mao Zedong, the great leader of the Chinese people!
    Long live Comrade Stalin, the great leader and teacher of the working people of the world!

    Congratulatory Telegram from the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles and Six Other Organizations to the Soviet Literary and Art Circles
    To all comrades in the literary and artistic circles of the esteemed Union of Soviet Socialist Republics:
    The anniversary of the Soviet October Socialist Revolution is a festival for all peace-loving people in the world. On the occasion of the 35th anniversary of the great Soviet October Socialist Revolution, we, the literary and artistic workers of the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, warmly celebrate the health of our beloved Marshal Stalin and the happiness of the Soviet people, and extend friendly and heartfelt congratulations to the Soviet literary and artistic circles—the glorious literary and artistic warriors!
    Like all the people of China, we feel particularly excited and happy when celebrating this great festival this year. Because under the correct leadership of our wise leader Chairman Mao, and with the constant assistance in all aspects from the Soviet people and the great socialist country, our country is becoming increasingly prosperous and strong.
    The glorious Soviet literary and artistic workers, under the leadership of the great and wise leader Stalin, have worked diligently for thirty-five years as if it were one day, and have already achieved great and amazing achievements in the field of literature and art. Soviet literary and artistic works have a vast and unparalleled influence in our country, and the works of outstanding Soviet writers are educating and inspiring our vast people in our country. We literary and artistic workers have gained countless valuable creative and struggle experiences from Soviet literary and artistic works. We feel infinitely honored by this and express our sincere gratitude to the Soviet literary and artistic circles.
    Today, when the mortal enemy of mankind, U.S. imperialism, is shamefully arming West Germany in the West and arming Japan in the East, creating a tense world situation, brazenly suspending the Korean armistice negotiations indefinitely, and attempting to launch a world war regardless of the firm opposition of the world's people, we will further use literary and artistic weapons to promote lasting world peace and expose the conspiracies and crimes of the aggressive camp headed by U.S. imperialism. We, the literary and artistic comrades of all of China, express to you—our dear Soviet literary and artistic workers: we will always unite as closely as one person, and jointly fight to the end for the great cause of defending world peace and defending world culture.
    We firmly believe that the struggle to defend world peace will surely be victorious, and the struggle to defend the cause of world culture will surely be victorious.
    Long live the literary and artistic cause of the people of China and the Soviet Union!
    Long live the unbreakable friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union!
    Long live world peace!

I wish the Soviet teachers new and brilliant victories in completing the Fifth Five-Year Plan, fully implementing technical education and ten-year universal education, and advancing towards a communist society under the leadership of the great Communist Party of the Soviet Union and its organizer, leader, and teacher of the working people of the world, Comrade Stalin!

    值此伟大的十月社会主义革命三十五周年之际，谨代表中国新民主主义青年团全体团员和中国青年致以衷心的祝贺。
    中国青年深刻地懂得：中国人民革命的伟大胜利与中华人民共和国成立三年来所获得的光辉成就，是与苏联十月社会主义革命的胜利、斯大林大元帅和苏联人民的同情与帮助分不开的。中国青年一向以苏联青年作为自己的榜样。苏联人民特别是苏联青年在社会主义和共产主义建设及保卫世界和平事业中的英雄业绩，对我们中国青年是很大的鼓舞。现在中国青年正热烈地卷入了全国人民庆祝苏联十月社会主义革命三十五周年和“中苏友好月”的活动。今后，我们将更加努力增进中苏两国人民的友谊，努力学习苏联社会主义和共产主义建设的经验，学习苏联青年的高度的爱国主义和国际主义精神，来迎接我国的大规模的经济建设，并为加强保卫东方和世界和平而斗争。

    中国工人阶级与劳动人民切身体验到苏联人民所给予中国的慷慨无私的援助，是建设新中国的必要条件。中国工人阶级正在全国范围内开展着爱国增产节约运动，迎接即将到来的大规模建设，并继续开展抗美援朝运动，保卫亚洲与世界和平。

    给苏联文学艺术界的贺电敬爱的苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟文学艺术界全体工作同志们：
    苏联的十月社会主义革命纪念节，是全世界爱好和平人民的节日。值此伟大苏联十月社会主义革命三十五周年之际，我们中华全国文学艺术工作者热烈地庆祝敬爱的斯大林大元帅的健康和苏联人民的幸福，并向苏联文学艺术界——光荣的全体文艺战士，致友谊的、衷心的祝贺！
    我们和全中国人民一样，在今年庆祝这个伟大节日的时候，特别感到兴奋和愉快。因为我们在英明领袖毛主席的正确领导下，加上不断地获得苏联人民和伟大社会主义国家所给予的各方面的帮助，已使我们国家日益繁荣富强。
    光荣的苏联文艺工作者，在伟大英明领袖斯大林领导下，三十五年如一日的辛勤劳作，在文学艺术事业方面已经获得了伟大而惊人的成就。苏联的文学艺术作品在我国有着广大无比的影响，苏联的杰出作家的作品，在我国教育着鼓舞着我们广大人民。我们文艺工作者从苏维埃文艺作品中，得到了无数宝贵的创作与斗争经验。我们以此感到无上光荣，并向苏联文艺界表示至诚的感谢。
    在人类死敌美帝国主义可耻地在西方武装西德，在东方武装日本，造成世界紧张局势，悍然无限期地中止了朝鲜停战谈判，并不顾世界人民的坚强反对而企图发动世界战争的今天，我们将更进一步地用文艺武器宣传世界持久和平，并揭露以美帝国主义为首的侵略阵营的阴谋和罪行。我们全中国的文学艺术工作同志们，向你们——亲爱的苏联文学艺术工作者们表示：我们永远紧密团结得像一个人一样，共同为保卫世界和平与保卫世界文化的伟大事业而奋斗到底。
    我们坚信：保卫世界和平的斗争必定胜利，保卫世界文化事业的斗争必定胜利。
