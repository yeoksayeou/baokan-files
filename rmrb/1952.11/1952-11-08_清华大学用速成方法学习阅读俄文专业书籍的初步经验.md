    Preliminary Experience of Tsinghua University in Learning to Read Russian Professional Books by Crash Course Method
    Tsinghua University Russian Professional Books Reading Crash Course Method Experiment Group
    Since the beginning of July, Tsinghua University has conducted experiments on accelerated learning of Russian professional book reading. The first time with one person, the second time with eleven people, after more than twenty days of concentrated intensive study of 150 to 180 hours, they achieved the effect of being able to independently read engineering books. The third time, starting from August 20, 238 teachers from the entire university concentrated their efforts on intensive Russian learning. After 90 hours of classroom teaching and self-study (plus approximately 45 hours of extracurricular review), 90% of the students improved from not knowing the Russian alphabet to being able to independently read engineering books. The learning effect was extremely significant.
    
    The Proposal of the Crash Course Method for Reading Russian Professional Books
    
    After liberation, most Tsinghua University teachers had studied Russian, hoping to be able to read Russian reference books. However, due to the unsuitable content and teaching methods of ordinary Russian teaching, the results were extremely poor. Although a few people persisted in studying for more than a year, their studies were not applied, and coupled with busy daily affairs, they forgot what they learned, and were still unable to read books. Therefore, they all felt that Russian was difficult to learn and were discouraged.
    
    After ideological remolding, teachers' demands for learning from the Soviet Union increased. After the adjustment of departments, everyone realized the superiority of the Soviet Union in all aspects even more, and urgently demanded to learn from the Soviet Union. However, standing in front of them was a "Russian is difficult to learn" mountain. Qian Junrui, Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government, called on everyone to "capture the mountain of not understanding Russian." The teachers were very excited and asked the preparatory committee for the adjustment of departments: "How to learn Russian?" The enthusiasm for learning was very high.
    
    However, the pain of not being able to learn Russian for a long time made people generally associate Russian with difficulty. Professor Dong Shuping of the Department of Mechanical Engineering said: "I felt really uncomfortable after listening to Deputy Minister Qian's report. The construction of the motherland urgently requires us to be proficient in Russian, but I have started over three times and still can't learn it well." People generally felt that it was difficult to learn Russian, let alone "crash course." No one believed it.
    
    Qi Jianhua's crash course literacy method gave us inspiration. In early July of this year, the Tsinghua University Party Committee analyzed the school's reform issues and believed that three contradictions needed to be resolved in the future: (1) the contradiction between teachers knowing and not knowing Soviet advanced experience; (2) the contradiction between theory and practice; (3) the contradiction between teaching methods meeting new requirements. To solve the first contradiction, it is necessary to learn Russian well first, and adopting the crash course method to learn to read Russian professional books can not only achieve this goal relatively quickly, but also serve as a demonstration for teaching reform.
    
    The favorable conditions for the crash course at that time were: everyone had high enthusiasm for learning, the purpose was clear (only requiring to be able to read engineering books in a certain major), the scope of new words to be mastered was not broad (about two thousand words), the grammar was also relatively simple, and the teachers had a long habit of reading and a foundation in a foreign language. The unfavorable conditions were the lack of Russian teachers with creative enthusiasm and understanding of engineering knowledge, and the ideological obstacles existing among the masses—lack of confidence in the crash course. However, these could be overcome. Therefore, the Party Committee suggested to the leadership to select a group of young teaching assistants and students who understood Russian to conduct experiments, use practice to prove the possibility of the crash course, and cultivate key personnel and learn from experience.
    
    The Situation of the Crash Course Experiment
    
    This crash course learning was completed within the planned learning time of 19 days and 90 hours (plus extracurricular review time—from 6 hours to 75 hours, generally around 45 hours). The method was: organize students to conduct concentrated intensive study, so that students remember about 900 commonly used engineering words, and master all the commonly used basic grammar in engineering books, so as to independently read engineering books and lay the foundation for further learning of Russian.
    
    Among the 238 people who participated in the third learning (aged from 20 to 65), 57 had never studied Russian, and the rest, although they had studied, had forgotten it due to the long time interval.
    
    The learning time was 19 days, excluding one day for mobilization and three days of holidays, a total of 15 days and 90 hours of planned learning time (excluding review time).
    
    Learning achievements: The original requirement was for each student to remember 800 to 1,000 new words. As a result, 85% of the people could remember more than 90% of the new words, and 12% of the people could remember more than 80%.
    
    Exam results: 71.8% of the students scored above 85 points, and 17.2% of the students scored between 75 and 85 points.
    
    Reading achievements: When starting to read, we selected 13 students of various types for investigation. Generally, they read about 200 words per hour, and some read up to 500 words; averaging about one to two pages. The reading materials included hydraulics, structural mechanics, chemical engineering principles, metallography, and other subjects. For example, Lin Shi'e (professor of the Aviation Institute) read 50 pages of "Aerodynamics" and 10 pages of "Aviation Instruments," with a speed of two to four pages per hour. When reading "Aerodynamics," there were no more than three new words per page, and when reading "Aviation Instruments," there were no more than 20 new words per page. He is now a tutor for crash course learning. Wang Youchun (teaching assistant of the Aviation Department) reads books every day after finishing the course. He read a total of 100 pages of "Aviation Gas Turbines" in three weeks, reading about three pages per hour, with an average of only four or five new words per page.
    
    The Effect and Influence of Crash Course Learning
    
    This crash course learning was a major event for all teachers at Tsinghua University, and its impact was significant. First of all, it enabled them to read Russian engineering books, opened the door to learning from Soviet experience, and created favorable conditions for teaching reform. For example, Professor Li Piji of the Civil Engineering Department was still someone who did not know the Russian alphabet 20 days ago. After completing the crash course learning, he said: "In the past, when I went to the international bookstore and saw the dazzling array of books, I was Russian illiterate. Now I have the key to open the treasure house of learning from Soviet experience." When he started reading, he read three pages of hydraulics in two hours and was very excited. Professor Sun Shaoxian of the Electrical Engineering Department said: "I never expected this result. Twenty days ago, I didn't know a single Russian word, but today I can actually read books. I believe that if I work hard for another half a year, I will be able to read Russian books as quickly as I read English books." He excitedly wrote "Thank you, comrades tutors" on the final exam paper and warmly shook hands with the group leader of the tutoring group. Many teachers have started reading books after completing the crash course learning. Secondly, it shattered conservative ideas and proved with facts that the ability to read Russian professional books can be cultivated by the crash course method. There were two main conservative ideas in the crash course learning: One was that Russian was too difficult to learn. Someone said: "Russian nouns have one hundred and eight declensions, and some verbs change so much that the original word is not even visible." This is indeed a difficulty; but some people feel that this is an insurmountable difficulty, which is wrong. The second was the fear that adults have poor memory. However, the facts negated these views. Professor Li Piji said: "I didn't believe in my memory originally, so I was very afraid at the beginning. But after studying for three days, it proved that the results of memorizing new words were not bad. One of the biggest gains from learning Russian this time is that I have regained confidence in my memory." Mr. Jin Tao, 65 years old, thought at the beginning: "I have studied more than 30 lessons of Russian intermittently in the past, but I forgot what I learned. Now my brain is still a blank sheet of paper. My results in this study are not bad. I can remember 90% of the new words, and one day I read most of a page of 'Theoretical Mechanics' in half an hour. I believe that I will be able to translate Russian books in the future." Thirdly, it played a demonstrative role in the reform of teaching methods. The crash course learning was carried out using new teaching methods, that is, using teaching and research groups for collective teaching. From compiling textbooks to giving lectures, all went through repeated discussions, research, and trial lectures. Therefore, it was possible to impart the original complex grammar to the students in a simplified and clear manner under the circumstances that the teachers' level was not high and the task was very arduous. After the lectures, there were classroom self-study and exercises. The activities after the lectures were led by the tutors. Because the tutors went deep into the masses, discovered problems and solved problems in a timely manner, they ensured that every student could complete the learning tasks on schedule. The teachers of Tsinghua University personally understood the benefits of this new teaching method and expressed that they would learn this spirit and improve teaching. For example, Cao Benxi, director of the Chemical Engineering Department, said: "The results of the crash course method are exciting. I must promote its experience to other teaching aspects. I believe that as long as everyone strives to learn from the Soviet Union's advanced experience, the original five-year teaching plan can be completed in four years." Teaching assistant Qu Shendi said: "In the future, when worker-peasant cadres come to Tsinghua to study, they will encounter many difficulties and need my patient help. I will definitely learn from the example of these tutors and work hard to do a good job as a teaching assistant." Professor Dong Shuping of the Department of Mechanical Engineering said: "This is the best learning condition I have ever had in my life. From the perspective of a student, I deeply realize that a new teaching system is growing up. In the future, I will help students learn well in this new system with the spirit that others tutor me."
    
    Preliminary Experience
    
    The teaching process is as follows: The first day is for ideological mobilization. Mobilization is repeatedly carried out by means of leaders' reports, typical reports (four teachers who succeeded in the experiment), and expressions of determination from teachers and students, so that students believe in the crash course method, believe in the leadership, and obey the leadership; at the same time, mobilization is carried out within the Party and Youth League organizations to ensure that Russian teaching is carried out well.
    
    Spend one and a half days teaching the alphabet and phonetics—three hours of lectures and six hours of practice. The requirement is to "be able to read the letters when you see them, be able to write the letters when you hear the sounds, be able to read the words when you see them, and read from beginning to end." There is no need to demand too much for pronunciation, but it must be basically correct, because pronunciation training has a great impact on the learning speed of new words. The study of basic grammar and new words is carried out in an interactive manner, for a total of eight and a half days. New words are required to be memorized intensively and consolidated at any time. Grammar teaching takes about eleven hours. After each lecture, review and do exercises immediately, requiring to be able to recognize the declensions of familiar words and their role in sentences. Professional text reading takes five days (the date can be extended appropriately). Select chapters from books used in each major as reading materials. This textbook should contain various common grammars. The reading of professional texts should be from easy to difficult, first reading carefully word by word and sentence by sentence, and then reading the entire paragraph, so as to cultivate students' independent reading ability; and intensively learn 300 to 500 new words from reading.
    
    What are the basic factors of the crash course? First, it is the students' high political enthusiasm and learning requirements, and on this basis, the complete trust in the leadership and the determination to overcome all difficulties. Second, it is the scientific selection and organization of teaching materials, with a clear purpose and emphasis on practicality; the arrangement is concise and emphasizes regularity. This meets the characteristics of adults who urgently need and have strong comprehension ability. And take the intensive method of first intensively memorizing a large number of new words, comprehensively and centrally teaching grammar, and then quickly entering the reading of professional texts to achieve proficiency and consolidation. (Unlike the regular learning method of "reading the text first, memorizing new words through the text, and gradually teaching grammar in small amounts.") Third, high concentration of thought is the decisive factor for the success of intensive study. The crash course method requires memorizing and understanding a large amount of material in a short period of time, so the key to success or failure lies first in concentration. Taking learning new words as an example, Nan Deheng of the Electrical Engineering Department memorized 100 new words in two hours one day without any difficulty. He only read it once and memorized more than half of it. The next morning, he failed to memorize 50 new words. After checking his thoughts, he realized that the Academic Affairs Office was urging him to hand in his transcripts, and his thoughts were distracted. There are many such examples. Generally speaking, there are three reasons why students' thoughts are not concentrated: One is objective reasons: the environment is not good, there are things on their minds, etc. This problem can be solved by the leadership. Some professors have made family agreements that they will not take care of housework during the study period, which is also a method. The second is subjective reasons: first of all, they think that they cannot memorize new words, so they have no confidence. In this way, their thoughts are not concentrated. Secondly, some comrades have always been free and undisciplined, and cannot concentrate their thoughts. Thirdly, impatience also affects the concentration of thought. This requires the tutors to pay attention to helping them frequently. The third is that the method is not right: for example, some people do not look at the Chinese first when memorizing new words, but read the Russian first, and as a result, they still cannot memorize it after reading it dozens of times. Some people did not make good use of word cards, but memorized new words from a pile of new words in the handout, which also distracted their attention. We advocate that the eyes, mouth, ears, and heart should be involved. Because of the concentration of thought, some students memorized half of the new words after the tutor led them to read them once in the classroom. If the tutors can frequently promote good learning methods, they can overcome the above shortcomings. Fourth, a good teaching organization and teaching methods ensure the success of the crash course learning. The teaching and research group is the core organization leading the entire learning. It is responsible for stipulating the progress, determining the key points, conducting trial lectures; assigning work to the tutors, assigning learning tasks to the students; fully reflecting the situation of the masses, and conducting collective research. Only when most students can complete the tasks in time can their emotions be full. The lectures should be concise and to the point, and the key points should be highlighted. Moreover, the learning key points and tasks should be assigned to the end to ensure that the learning tasks are completed quickly every day. The tutor is the guarantor for completing the teaching tasks. Each tutor is in charge of five to six to more than a dozen students. He must go deep into the masses to discover problems, and actively and systematically conduct tutoring work. He is not a passive living dictionary, but a promoter, organizer, inspector, and promoter of advanced learning methods for the entire group. When the tutor discovers that students have impatience or lack of confidence, he should immediately help them. Students who feel particularly difficult should be given individual help outside of class. This ensures that everyone can complete the task. It is necessary to use scientific learning methods. One of the reasons why students do not learn well is that the method is not scientific. We promoted some good methods, which greatly helped learning. For example, memorizing new words requires the heart, eyes, mouth, and ears to be involved, and reading aloud. Use cards, dividing two or thirty words into a group according to difficulty. After reading each group of new words several times, a batch of words can be remembered. The words that cannot be remembered are classified into the next group and read again. After reading several groups, review them again. This batch-by-batch rotation memory can greatly increase the speed of memorizing new words. The last few "troublemaker words" can be carried around and read often. The method of classifying new words with cards also facilitates review. The review interval for easy-to-remember new words can be longer, and the review interval for difficult-to-remember new words can be shorter. Regarding the analysis of sentences: First of all, it is necessary to emphasize careful reading, distinguish the gender, number, case, person, and tense of each word, and use arrows to indicate its role. At the same time, advocate the method of "bracketing" to facilitate analysis. Students who use this method read one to two times faster than before using this method.
    
    In the crash course process, attention should be paid to the combination of intensive study and consolidation. After a large number of new words or teaching materials are intensively studied in two or three hours, some of the new words will be forgotten if they are not reviewed in time. Therefore, consolidation is extremely important. Generally speaking, after intensively studying new words, the "troublemaker words" and "stubborn words" must be reviewed on the same day. After that, review the words that are not easy to remember once a day, and review the words that are easy to remember once every two or three days. Grammar should also be reviewed after learning. The tutor assigns "homework" according to each person's level.
    
    Solve the learning ideological problems that occur in each stage specifically and separately. The ideological problems in learning must be solved by taking different methods according to different stages. For example: Professor Yu Ruihuang of the Physics Department could not complete the daily learning tasks at the beginning. The tutor asked him to memorize the new words first and then read the books. During the reading process, he focused on grammar. If there were still new words, the tutor would answer them. In this way, he made rapid progress. He said: "I used to have two burdens, one was new words and the other was grammar, so I didn't learn well. In this way, there was a third burden—emotions. Today the tutor helped me like this, and all the burdens are gone. For the first time, I enjoyed the pleasure of reading Russian."
    
    Use the crash course method to train cadres. Our cadres come from all directions, with different levels of Russian and professional skills, complex ideas, and some people do not believe in the crash course. However, we have adopted the method of collective learning with leadership in our work. Comrades who understand Russian but do not understand the profession and those who understand the profession but do not understand Russian help each other. At the same time, we vigorously exchange experiences in our work, constantly correct incorrect ideas, and improve our work. In this way, most cadres can complete the teaching tasks well.
    
    The crash course learning of reading Russian professional books can definitely be successful. However, the crash course learning is only the beginning of learning Russian. It is necessary to read frequently, consolidate the results, improve the reading speed, and expand the vocabulary. Otherwise, the gains from the crash course are very likely to be lost (forgotten). We are continuing to organize regular learning to consolidate this achievement and seek further improvement.

    清华大学用速成方法学习阅读俄文专业书籍的初步经验
    清华大学俄文专业书籍阅读速成法试验组
    清华大学自七月初起，进行了俄文专业书籍阅读速成学习的试验。第一次一人，第二次十一人，先后在二十余天一百五十到一百八十小时的集中突击学习中，收到能独立阅读工程书籍的效果。第三次，自八月二十日起，全校教师二百三十八人集中力量突击学习俄文，经过九十小时的课堂教学和自习（外加四十五小时左右的课外复习），百分之九十的学员都从不识俄文字母提高到能独立阅读工程书籍的程度，学习效果极为显著。
    俄文专业书籍阅读速成方法的提出
    解放以后，大部分清华大学教师都学习过俄文，想借此能够阅读俄文参考书籍。但由于普通俄文教学的内容和教法都不合要求，因此效果极差。少数人虽坚持学了一年以上，但学非所用，加上平时事务繁多，随学随忘，还是不能看书。因此都感到俄文难学，灰心失望。
    经过思想改造，教师们学习苏联的要求提高了。院系调整以后，大家更体会到苏联各方面的优越性，迫切要求学习苏联。但是，横亘在面前的是一座“俄文难学”的大山。中央人民政府教育部钱俊瑞副部长号召大家“攻占不懂俄文这座大山”，教师们大为兴奋，纷纷问院系调整筹备委员会：“怎样学习俄文？”学习热情很高。
    但是，长期学不好俄文的痛苦，使一般人把俄文和困难连在一起。机械系教授董树屏说：“我听了钱副部长的报告，心里真难受。祖国建设迫切要求我们通晓俄文，但我已开始过三遍，老是学不好。”对于学俄文普遍感到困难，至于“速成”，更没人相信了。
    祁建华的速成识字法，给予我们以启示。今年七月初，清华大学党委会分析了学校改革问题，认为今后须要解决三个矛盾：（1）教员对苏联先进经验知和不知的矛盾；（2）理论能否联系实际的矛盾；（3）教学方法能否满足新要求的矛盾。要解决第一矛盾，首先要学好俄文，而采取速成方法来学习阅读俄文专业书籍，不仅能够比较迅速地达到这个目的，也将对教学改革起示范作用。
    当时分析速成的有利条件是：大家的学习热情高，目的明确（只要求会读某一专业的工程书），所要求掌握的生词范围不广（大约两千个左右生词），语法也较简单，教师们又有长期读书的习惯及一种外语基础。不利条件是缺乏有创造热情并懂得工程知识的俄文教员，以及存在于群众中的思想障碍——对速成无信心，但这些是可以克服的。因此，党委会向领导方面建议，挑选一批懂得俄文的青年助教和学生进行试验，用实践来证明速成的可能性，并培养骨干，吸取经验。
    速成试验的情况
    这次速成学习是在十九天九十小时的计划学习时间（外加课外复习时间——从六小时到七十五小时，一般在四十五小时左右）之内完成的。方法是：组织学员进行集中的突击学习，使学员记住九百个左右的工程常用单词，并掌握工程书上全部常用的基本语法，以便独立阅读工程书籍，并打下进一步学习俄文的基础。
    参加第三次学习的二百三十八人（年龄自二十岁到六十五岁），其中五十七人未学过俄文，其余虽学过，因时间相隔过久，也已遗忘。
    学习时间十九天，除以一天进行动员及三天假日外，共十五天九十小时计划学习时间（复习时间不在内）。
    学习成绩：原规定每个学员要记住生词八百到一千个，学习结果，有百分之八十五的人能记住百分之九十以上的生词，百分之十二的人能记住百分之八十以上。
    考试成绩：百分之七十一点八的学员在八十五分以上，百分之十七点二的学员在七十五到八十五分。
    阅读成绩：开始阅读时，我们选择了十三个各种类型的学员进行了调查，一般每小时阅读二百个词左右，多的达五百个词；平均一页到两页左右。阅读书籍包括水力学、结构力学、化工原理、金相学等多种。例如林士谔（航空学院教授）看了五十页“空气动力学”，“航空仪表”十页，每小时速度为二到四页。看“空气动力学”每页生词不超过三个，看“航空仪表”每页不超过二十个。现为速成学习的辅导员。王幼纯（航空系助教）学完后每天看书，三周内看“航空汽轮机”共一百页，每小时约看三页，每页生词一般的只有四五个。
    速成学习的效果及其影响
    这一次速成学习对于清华大学的全体教师来说，是一件大事，它的影响是很大的。首先使他们具备了阅读俄文工程书籍的能力，打开了学习苏联经验的大门，为教学改革创造了有利条件。例如土木系李丕济教授在二十天前还是一个俄文字母不识的人，在完成速成学习之后，他说：“过去我走到国际书店一看，琳琅满目，可是我是俄文盲。现在我有了打开学习苏联经验宝库的钥匙。”他在开始阅读时，两小时看了三页水利学，非常兴奋。电机系孙绍先教授说：“我完全想不到有这个成绩，二十天前我一个俄文字不识，今天居然能看书了。我相信如再努力半年，看俄文书一定能像看英文书一样快。”他兴奋地在最后考卷上大书“感谢辅导员同志”，并和辅导组长热烈握手。许多教师经过速成学习都已开始看书了。其次，粉碎了保守思想，用事实证明阅读俄文专业书籍的能力是可以用速成法培养的。在速成学习中主要有两种保守思想：一是认为俄文太难学。有人说：“俄文的名词变格有一百零八种，动词有的变得连原来的字影儿都不见了。”这的确是困难；但有些人觉得这是不能克服的困难，这就不对了。二是怕成年人记性不好。但是事实否定了这些看法，李丕济教授说：“我本来不相信我的记忆力，所以一开始我是很怕的。但学了三天，证明记生词的成绩并不坏。我这次学俄文的最大收获之一，是恢复了对自己的记忆力的信心。”六十五岁的金涛老先生，开始时想：“我过去断断续续念了三十多课俄文，但随念随忘，到如今脑中还是一张白纸。这一次学习，我的成绩并不差，生词能记得百分之九十，有一天在半小时内就看了大半页‘理论力学’。我相信将来我也能翻译俄文书籍。”第三，在教学方法改革上起了示范作用。速成学习是采取新的教学方法进行的，即利用教研组进行集体教学。从编教材到讲课，都经过反复讨论、研究、试讲，因此能在教员水平不高而任务又很艰巨的情况下，把原来很繁复的语法很精简清晰地传授给学员。讲课后又进行课堂自学并作练习。讲课以后的活动由辅导员进行领导。由于辅导员深入群众，及时发现问题，解决问题，保证了每一个学员都能按期完成学习任务。清华大学教师们都亲身领会到这种新的教学方法的好处，纷纷表示要学习这种精神，改进教学。例如化工系主任曹本喜说：“速成法的成绩是令人兴奋的，我一定要把它的经验推广到其他教学方面去。我相信大家只要努力学习苏联的先进经验，原订五年制教学计划可以在四年内完成。”助教曲慎隄说：“将来工农干部来清华学习，会遇到很多困难，需要我耐心帮助，我一定学习这些辅导员的榜样，努力做好助教工作。”机械系董树屏教授说：“这是我一生中学习条件最好的一次。从一个学员的角度出发，我深深体会到一个新的教学制度在成长起来了。今后我要在这个新制度下，以别人辅导我的精神去帮助学生学好。”
    初步经验
    教学过程是这样的：第一天进行思想动员。用首长报告、典型报告（试验成功的教师四人）及教员、学员表示决心等方式反复进行动员，使学员相信速成法，相信领导，服从领导；同时在党和青年团组织内进行动员，保证搞好俄文教学工作。
    用一天半的时间教字母教拼音——讲三小时，练习六小时。要求做到“见了字母能读，听了字母的音能写，见了词就能读出来，从头念到尾”。发音不必要求过高但须基本正确，因为发音训练对于生词的学习速度有极大影响。基本语法和生词突击的学习，采取交互进行的方式，共八天半。生词要求突击记忆，随时巩固。语法讲授约十一小时。每次讲完后，即时进行复习，做练习，要求做到能认熟词的变格及其在句中的作用。专业课文阅读五天（可以适当延长日期）。选择各该专业所用书籍中的章节作为阅读材料。这种教材要包含各种常见的语法。专业课文的阅读，要由易到难，先是逐字逐句地精读，然后整段阅读，以培养学员的独立阅读能力；并从阅读中突击学习三百到五百个生词。
    速成的基本因素是什么呢？第一，是学员的高度政治热情和学习要求，及在此基础上产生的对领导方面的完全信任，和克服一切困难的决心。第二，是教材选择和组织的科学化，目的明确，强调实用性；编排精练，强调规律性。这样就符合成人要求迫切及理解力强的特点。并采取先大量突击生词，全面地集中地讲授语法，然后迅速进入阅读专业课文以求熟练巩固的突击办法。（不像平时“先念课文，通过课文记生词，并逐步地少量地讲语法”的正规学法。）第三，思想高度集中是突击学习成功与否的决定性因素。速成法要求在短期内记忆并理解大量材料，因此成败的关键首先在于思想集中。以学习生词为例，电机系南德恒有一天在两小时内背了一百个生词，毫无困难。他起先只读完了一遍就记了一半多。第二天上午他未能把五十个生词记住，一检查思想，原来是教务处催他交成绩单，他的思想分散了。这种例子是很多的。一般讲，学员的思想所以不集中有三方面的原因：一是客观原因：环境不好，有事在心，等等。这种问题可以由领导方面来解决。有的教授订了家庭公约，在学习期间不管家务，这也是一种办法。二是主观原因：首先是认为自己不能背生词，因此无信心。这样，思想就不集中了。其次是有些同志一向自由散漫惯了，思想集中不起来。再次是急躁情绪，它也影响思想的集中。这就需要辅导员经常注意帮助。三是方法不对头：例如有人背生词时不看中文先念俄文，结果念了数十遍，还是背不出来。有的人没有很好地利用字片，而从讲义上一大堆生词中去背生词，也就分散了注意力。我们提倡眼到、口到、耳到、心到。有的学员由于思想集中，当辅导员在堂上带念一遍后，就把生词记下了一半。辅导员如能经常推广好的学习方法，可以克服以上缺点。第四，良好的教学组织和教学方法保证了速成学习的成功。教研组是领导整个学习的核心组织，它负责规定进度，确定重点，进行试讲；向辅导员布置工作，向学员布置学习任务；充分反映群众情况，并进行集体研究。要使大部分学员能及时完成任务，他们的情绪才能饱满。讲课要精练、扼要，重点突出。而且学习重点和任务要一直布置到底，才能保证每天迅速地完成学习任务。辅导员是完成教学任务的保证者。每一辅导员管五六个到十几个学员，他必须深入群众发现问题，主动地有计划地进行辅导工作。他不是一个被动的活词典，而是全小组学习的鼓动者、组织者、检查者和先进学习方法的推广者。辅导员发现学员有急躁情绪或信心不足的现象时，应马上加以帮助。对特别感到困难的学员则在课外进行个别帮助。这样就保证了每个人都能完成任务。运用科学的学习方法是必要的。学习不好的学员，其原因之一在于方法不科学。我们推广了一些好的方法，对学习帮助极大。例如背生词要心、眼、口、耳四到，大声念。要用卡片，按难易把二三十个词分为一组。每组生词念几遍后可记住一批。记不住的归入次组再念，念完几组后又复习一次。这样分批轮流记忆，可以大大增加背生词的速度。最后剩下的几个“捣蛋字”，可以带在身上常读。用卡片把生词加以分类的办法也便于复习。容易记的生词，复习间隔可长些，难记的生词，可短些。关于分析句子：首先要强调精读，分辨每个词的性、数、格、人称、时，用箭头表示其作用。同时提倡“打括弧”的方法，以便于分析。采用这种方法的学员，阅读速度比未用这种方法前快一倍到两倍。
    速成过程中应注意突击和巩固相结合。大批生词或教材在两三小时内突击完了以后，如不及时进行复习，一部分生词一定会遗忘，因此，巩固是极重要的。一般地讲，突击生词后，在当天必须复习其中的“捣蛋字”“顽固字”。以后每天复习一次那些不易记牢的词，过两三天再复习一次容易记牢的词。学语法后也要进行复习，由辅导员按每人程度布置“家庭作业”。
    要具体地分别解决每一阶段内发生的学习思想问题。学习中的思想问题必须按照不同的阶段采取不同的方法加以解决。例如：物理系余瑞璜教授开始时每天学习任务完成不了，辅导员便要他先背熟生词后才看书，看书过程中则专搞语法，如仍有生词再由辅导员解答。这样，他进步很快。他说：“我过去有两个包袱，一是生词，一是语法，因此我学不好，这样就有了第三个包袱——情绪。今天辅导员这样帮助我，包袱全没有了。我第一次享受了一下读俄文的乐趣。”
    用速成的办法培养干部。我们的干部来自各方，俄文水平和专业水平各异，思想也复杂，还有人不相信速成的。但我们在工作中采取了有领导的集体学习的办法，懂俄文而不懂专业的同志和懂专业而俄文不懂的人进行互助。同时在工作中大力交流经验，不断纠正不正确的思想，改进工作。这样一来，大多数干部都能很好完成教学任务。
    阅读俄文专业书籍的速成学习，肯定是可以成功的。不过，速成学习只是学习俄文的开端，必须经常进行阅读，巩固成果，提高阅读速度并扩大词汇。否则，速成的收获是极可能丧失（被遗忘掉）的。我们正继续组织经常学习，把这个成绩巩固下来，并求得进一步的提高。
