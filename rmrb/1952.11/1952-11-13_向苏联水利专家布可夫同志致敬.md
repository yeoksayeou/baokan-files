    To Comrade Bukov, dear Comrade Bukov: When the great Huai River project began, I first saw your name in the newspaper. You responded to the call of the great Stalin and came to China to unreservedly pass on the advanced experience of Soviet socialist water conservancy construction of more than 30 years to the water conservancy project builders of New China, using it in the struggle to transform nature to improve the people's living standards. I, like every Chinese person, deeply felt the profound friendship of the Soviet people towards us, and was deeply impressed by you.
    Afterwards, I often browsed through the newspapers, looking for your glorious name. I saw your selfless work enthusiasm and learned many of your advanced scientific and technological experiences. I felt that you never rested, constantly running between the upper and lower reaches of the Huai River. Later, I learned that you suffered from serious eye problems due to overwork and prolonged exposure to the wind and sand of the riverbank; but you insisted on not resting. Only after repeated advice from the doctor did you agree to seek treatment. In the hospital, you still never forgot your work - how to better control floods. How concerned you are about the lives of the Chinese people!
    Once, in a soil mechanics class, the teacher specifically mentioned the Soviet advanced experience of "building sluice gates without driving piles" that you introduced to us in the Huai River project, saving a lot of manpower, material resources and time, and ensuring the smooth completion of the sluice gate project. In the past, the American invaders asked us to use piles to stabilize the gate foundation, which meant that we had to pay a high price to buy steel sheet piles from American capitalists. This is how the imperialist elements painstakingly invaded and exploited us. Today, we Chinese people have repelled the aggressive forces of imperialism, and with the selfless assistance of the great Soviet people, we have begun to rebuild our motherland's garden with our own hands.
    During the winter vacation last year, we visited the Banqiao Reservoir project on the Huai River and the Yellow River Diversion to Benefit Wei project on the north bank of the Yellow River. At the Banqiao Reservoir construction site, we listened to many special lectures by engineers, and almost every report mentioned your name. This aroused our great excitement. We loved to hear everything about your deeds, even your usual words and actions. There I obtained a business learning material, and when I opened it, the first page recorded your glorious work facts: You and Minister of Water Conservancy Fu Zuoyi braved the wind and snow to inspect the project along the Huai River. In the Banqiao Reservoir, you solved the problem of silt in the dam foundation; gave many instructions on the design of the tunnel; jointly improved the design of the stilling basin with other experts; and also put forward rational suggestions for the earthen bottom of the tail canal of the spillway;.... The many valuable instructions and suggestions you put forward ensured the safety of the project in some cases, and saved unnecessary expenses in others. These made us deeply aware of the importance of "learning from the Soviet Union". At the construction site of the Yellow River Diversion to Benefit Wei project, we found that the engineers there were also very familiar with and admired you, and even the farmers nearby who were building branch canals and farm canals knew you. When we mentioned your name, they replied without hesitation: "The Soviet elder brother, who doesn't know him!" Just as the unbreakable friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people has taken deep root in the hearts of all Chinese people, your name has spread from the Huai River all the way to the Yellow River.
    This April, the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project began, and more than 60 teachers and students from our school participated in the work. They all wrote to the students who stayed at the school with extremely pleasant and excited moods, telling them that they were honored to have seen you. My teacher, Mr. Feng Guodong, once attended a technical seminar in Shashi that you also participated in. He told us admiringly that you respected the opinions of Chinese engineers very much. You are good at inspiring and guiding everyone to discuss new suggestions and improvements for each problem collectively. Moreover, for the benefit of the Chinese people, you can also frankly criticize certain incorrect attitudes and thoughts. The engineers were very satisfied and admired the democratic way you introduced your experience. In order for the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project to be completed in a short period of time, you not only made great contributions technically, but also worked tirelessly at the construction site. Sometimes, you risked climbing high stone piers to look into the distance; sometimes, you rolled up your trouser legs and walked back and forth in the mud; sometimes, you could not find a berth during the journey, so you casually slept under the eaves. You often told Chinese engineering and technical personnel that they must rely on the masses, and that technology, politics, and the masses must be closely integrated, and you set an example with practical actions. When you found that some workers were not up to standard in mixing concrete and tamping work at the regulating gate, you asked the cadres: "Have you held a meeting among the workers?" Afterwards, you solemnly told everyone with vivid facts that technology must be handed over to the masses, and also said: "China is just beginning to carry out large-scale water conservancy construction. By attaching importance to project quality from the beginning, it will give practical education to the masses, especially those students who come to practice, and set a good example for future water conservancy construction." How concerned you are about our future construction!
    Among the students of our Water Conservancy College, the phrase "Take Comrade Bukov as a shining example" has become a slogan to encourage each other. How sincerely the Chinese people thank you! Many workers and peasants cheer and applaud when they see you. Zhang Yusong, a mute worker from Songzi County, jumped up and down happily when he saw you; a farmer woman insisted on inviting you to drink sweet wine, but insisted on not taking any money. These are precisely the expressions of the Chinese people's love for you, and the precious feelings of the Chinese people's respect and gratitude for Comrade Stalin, the leader of the working people of the world, and the great Soviet people educated and led by him.

    向苏联水利专家布可夫同志致敬
    亲爱的布可夫同志：当伟大的治淮工程开始时，我在报纸上第一次看到了你的名字。你响应伟大斯大林的号召来到中国，要把三十多年来苏联社会主义水利建设的先进经验毫无保留地交给新中国的水利工程建设者，用之于为提高人民生活水平的改造大自然的斗争。我，正像每一个中国人民一样，深深感到苏联人民对我们的深切友爱，并且对你留下了深刻的印象。
    以后，我时常翻阅报纸，寻找着你的光荣的名字。我看到了你的忘我的工作热情，学习过你的许多先进科学技术经验。我觉着你从没休息过，不断奔走在淮河上下游之间。后来，我得知你因为过于疲劳，长久受着河岸风沙的侵袭，害着很严重的眼疾；但还坚持不肯休息。直到医生数次劝告以后，你才肯去诊治。在医院里你仍是念念不忘你的工作——如何才能更好地控制洪水。你是多么关怀着中国人民的生活啊！
    有一次，在上土壤力学课时，老师特别提到了你在治淮工程中介绍给我们的“建闸不打桩”的苏联先进经验，节省了很多人力、物力和时间，保证了建闸工程的顺利完成。过去，美国侵略者让我们用打桩稳固闸基，这就是说：要我们出很高的价钱去向美国资本家买钢板桩。帝国主义分子就是这样处心积虑地侵略和压榨我们。今天，我们中国人民打退了帝国主义的侵略势力，在伟大的苏联人民的无私援助下，开始用自己的双手重新建设起祖国的花园。
    去年寒假期间，我们参观了淮河的板桥水库工程和黄河北岸的引黄济卫工程。在板桥水库工地上，我们听了许多工程师的专题讲演，差不多每个报告都提到了你的名字。这引起我们极大的兴奋，我们爱听一切有关你的事迹，那怕是你平时的一言一动。在那里我得到了一本业务学习资料，打开一看，第一页就记载着你光荣的工作事实：你和中央水利部傅作义部长冒着风雪沿淮河检查工程。在板桥水库中，你解决了坝基淤泥的问题；对隧道的设计作了很多指示；和其他专家们共同改良了静水池的设计工程；对溢洪道尾渠的土底也提出了合理化建议；……。你提出的这许多宝贵的指示和建议，有的保证了工程的安全，有的节省了不必要的开支。这些，使我们深刻地认识了“向苏联学习”的重要性。在引黄济卫工程的工地上，我们发现，那里的工程师对你同样是十分熟悉和钦佩，连附近正在修筑斗渠和农渠的农民们没有一个不知道你。当我们一提起你的名字时，他们不加思索地回答说：“苏联老大哥，那个不认得！”正如中苏两国人民牢不可破的友谊已经在全中国人民心里深深地生了根一样，你的名字，从淮河一直传到了黄河。
    今年四月，荆江分洪工程开始了，我们学校有六十多位师生参加了工作。他们都怀着极其愉快兴奋的心情写信告诉留校的同学，他们荣幸地看到了你。我的老师冯国栋先生曾经在沙市出席你也参加了的技术座谈会。他钦佩地告诉我们说：你很尊重中国工程师的意见。你对每一问题的新的建议和改进，都善于启发诱导大家来集体讨论。而且，为了中国人民的利益，你也能坦率地批评某些不正确的态度和思想。工程师们对你介绍经验的民主方式感到非常满意和敬佩。为了荆江分洪工程能在短期内完成，你不但在技术上作了很大的贡献，并且不辞劳苦地在工地上奔走着，有时，你冒着危险攀上很高的石墩向远处了望；有时，你卷起裤腿在泥泞中走来走去；有时，在旅途中你找不到铺位，就随意睡在屋檐下。你经常告诉中国工程技术人员：必须依靠群众，要使技术、政治、群众紧密地结合，而且以实际行动做出了榜样。当你在节制闸发现有些工人在拌混凝土和捣固工作不够标准时，你就问干部：“在工人群众中开过会没有？”随后，你又用生动的事实严肃地告诉大家：必须把技术交给群众，还说：“中国还是刚刚开始比较大规模地进行水利建设，通过开头就重视工程质量，会给群众特别是那些来实习的学生以实际的教育，树立起将来水利建设事业上良好的榜样。”你是多么关心我们未来的建设啊！
    在我们水利学院的同学中，“以布可夫同志为光辉榜样”这句话已经成为互相勉励的口号了。中国人民是如何地衷心感激你啊！许多工人和农民一看到你就欢呼鼓舞。松滋县的哑吧民工张玉松，看到你欢喜得手舞足蹈地跳跃起来；一位农妇一定要请你吃甜酒，但坚持不肯要钱。这些，正是全中国人民对你热爱的表现，正是全中国人民对全世界劳动人民的领袖斯大林同志及其教育和领导下的伟大苏联人民的尊敬和感谢的可贵感情。
