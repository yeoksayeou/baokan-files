    The Beijing Municipal People's Government conscientiously implements the "Decision on Handling Letters from the People and Receiving the People" of the Central People's Government's Government Administration Council, and has established more extensive and closer ties with the broad masses of the people. In the half-year from January to June this year, the Secretariat of the Municipal People's Government alone received 3,273 letters from the people, an increase of about one and a half times compared with the second half of last year. In June of this year alone, 134 people went directly to the Secretariat of the Municipal People's Government to talk. The letters and talks from the masses reflected the main problems in various aspects of work during each period. For example, during the first half of this year, when the city was tensely carrying out the great "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, the Secretariat received the most suggestions and reports related to this aspect in letters from the masses, totaling 766. After the great "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, anonymous letters decreased significantly. After the labor employment registration was held, letters requesting solutions to personal life and work problems also decreased significantly.

    In order to urge its subordinate units to conscientiously do a good job in handling letters from the people and receiving the masses, the Municipal People's Government made a decision at an administrative meeting; Mayor Peng Zhen also constantly instructed all units to conscientiously do this work. The Secretariat of the Municipal Government and its subordinate municipal-level units generally have dedicated personnel responsible for handling letters from the people and receiving the masses. Many places have reception rooms, and generally have established various systems for registration, transfer, inspection, follow-up, and archiving. All letters are processed separately after being registered in a special register; the most important ones are sent by the Secretariat of the Municipal Government to the Mayor and Deputy Mayor for personal instructions to be forwarded to the relevant competent departments for handling, or the Secretariat sends people to visit, interview, and investigate before processing them. In order to frequently understand the needs and opinions of the people, the Mayor and Deputy Mayor designated the Secretariat to classify and statistically analyze the letters from the people according to their content, and include representative letters in the weekly report. They all gave instructions after each reading. Specific instructions were given for problems that were not handled properly or that needed further investigation and research. Some of the problems raised in the letters from the people were also brought to the joint office meeting or other meetings of the Municipal Government for research and handling. The units to which the Secretariat of the Municipal Government forwarded letters for processing must report the processing situation to the Secretariat for review. The Secretariat informs the letter writers of the results of the processed letters through interviews, visits, telephone calls, written forms, etc.; those that have not been processed completely or have been handled improperly or whose self-criticisms are not profound are returned to the sponsoring unit or relevant unit for further processing.

    In July of this year, in order to further implement the decision of the Central People's Government's Government Administration Council, the Municipal People's Government urged its subordinate units to generally inspect the work of handling letters from the people and receiving the masses in the first half of this year. Some bureaus made inspections and self-criticisms at bureau affairs meetings; some units organized cadres to study the documents of the Zhang Shunyou incident and re-studied the decision of the Government Administration Council; some drew cadres to clean up the backlog of letters, and some appropriately transferred stronger cadres to take on this work. Since then, the problems raised by the people have generally been handled more promptly and conscientiously than in the past by all units.

    However, there are still some shortcomings in this work: the phenomenon of backlog and procrastination is still very serious in some units. Some units do a very poor job of follow-up, inspection, and research, and adopt a perfunctory attitude towards the problems raised by the people, lacking a spirit of responsibility to the end. For example, in August of this year alone, the middle school group in the personnel office of the former Bureau of Culture and Education (now the Education Bureau) had a backlog of more than 200 letters from the masses, some of which were sent last year. The person in charge of the office was completely indifferent to this situation. The cadres in charge of this work did not even open the letters to read them until a few days after receiving them. For another example, the issue of veteran cadres sent back to Beijing from other places receiving subsistence grain should have been handled by the Personnel Bureau; however, on June 3 this year, when Guan Baoyi, a cadre sent back to Beijing by the People's Government of Datong County, Chahar, went to the Personnel Bureau with a letter of introduction to apply for subsistence grain, the department in charge of the bureau did not receive him, but only asked the messenger to take a look at the letter of introduction, and irresponsibly told him to go to the local district People's Government – the former Seventh District People's Government – to resolve it. The district People's Government had not handled this kind of work before, so it pushed it to the Municipal Government. The secretary in charge of the Secretariat of the Municipal Government did not know who should handle it, and after contacting the Civil Affairs Bureau, told Guan Baoyi to go to the Civil Affairs Bureau. After the Civil Affairs Bureau contacted the Personnel Bureau, they told him to go to the district People's Government again. Because the district People's Government still could not solve his problem, Guan Baoyi went to the Municipal Government again. The secretary in charge of the Secretariat of the Municipal Government contacted the district People's Government and the Personnel Bureau again, and told him to go to the district People's Government. This irresponsible pushing back and forth continued until June 15, when the problem was finally solved. Some units simply copied and forwarded the letters, and even forwarded letters reflecting the style of cadres directly to the accused, which greatly dissatisfied the letter writers. Chen Ji, the former deputy director of the administrative department of the Bureau of Industry and Commerce, even rudely believed that a letter from the masses "reflected untrue information" and tore up the letter. There are also some units that do not have sound systems, either simply doing things without being able to check afterwards, or having cumbersome procedures and low work efficiency. Another most common shortcoming is that they are only accustomed to handling the problems raised by the people individually, lacking analysis and synthesis, and cannot promptly comprehend the demands of the masses from this work, thereby improving work and leadership; in particular, they lack research on universal problems, and therefore cannot proactively and systematically solve problems.

    In order to continue to strengthen the work of handling letters from the people and receiving the masses, Mayor Peng Zhen has instructed the heads of all units to check once every half month. The Municipal People's Government has also decided to strengthen the comprehensive research work on letters from the people in order to systematically solve universal problems. In addition, it has decided to continue to improve various systems, and appropriately strengthen the cadre force according to work needs.

    北京市人民政府和人民关系更加密切
    认真处理人民来信重视接见人民
    北京市人民政府认真执行中央人民政府政务院“关于处理人民来信和接见人民工作的决定”，与广大人民群众建立了更加广泛和更加密切的联系。今年一月到六月的半年中，仅市人民政府秘书厅收到的人民来信就有三千二百七十三件，比去年下半年约增一倍半。直接到市人民政府秘书厅去谈话的，光今年六月份就有一百三十四人。群众的来信和谈话反映了各时期各方面工作中的主要问题。例如：今年上半年全市正在紧张地开展伟大的“三反”“五反”运动的时候，秘书厅收到的群众来信中，有关这一方面的建议和检举信件最多，共有七百六十六件。经过伟大的“三反”“五反”运动，匿名信大大地减少了。举办劳动就业登记以后，要求解决个人生活与工作问题的信件也大大地减少了。
    市人民政府为了督促所属各单位认真做好处理人民来信和接见人民群众的工作，曾经在行政会议上作了决定；彭真市长也不断指示各单位要认真做好这项工作。市府秘书厅和所属市级各单位普遍设有专人负责处理人民来信和接见人民群众，许多地方都设有接待室，一般建立了登记、转办、检查、催办、存档等各项制度。所有来信都经专簿登记后分别处理；最重要的还由市府秘书厅送给市长、副市长亲自批示转交有关主管部门办理，或由秘书厅派人访问、约谈、调查后加以处理。市长、副市长为了经常了解人民的要求和意见，指定秘书厅将人民的来信按内容分类统计，连同具有代表性的来信列入周报。他们每次阅后都有批示。对处理不恰当，或应再作调查研究的问题，都有具体指示。人民来信中所提出的有些问题，还被提到市府的联合办公或其他会议上研究处理。市府秘书厅转交各单位处理的来信，各单位要把处理情况回报秘书厅审查。秘书厅对已处理的来信需要把结果告知来信人的，都分别用约谈、访问、电话、书面等方式告知；对没有处理完毕或处理不当、检讨不深刻的，都退回主办单位或有关单位另作处理。
    今年七月，市人民政府为了进一步贯彻执行中央人民政府政务院的决定，又督促所属各单位普遍检查了今年上半年处理人民来信和接见人民群众的工作。有的局在局务会议上作了检查和检讨；有的单位组织干部结合学习张顺有事件的文件，再一次学习了政务院的决定；有的抽调干部清理了积压的信件，还有的适当地抽调了较强的干部来担任这项工作。从此以后，各单位对人民群众提出的问题，一般都比过去处理得及时和认真了。
    但是，这项工作中还存在着一些缺点：积压和拖延不办的现象在有些单位中仍很严重。有些单位的催办、检查、研究等工作做得很差，对人民群众提出的问题，采取敷衍搪塞的态度，缺乏负责到底的精神。例如：今年八月份，仅前文教局（现教育局）人事室里的一个中学组就积压了群众来信二百多封，这些被积压的信件有的还是去年来的。该室负责人对这种情况竟熟视无睹。主管这项工作的干部，在收到群众来信的几天以后，还不打开看。又如，因年老遣返回京的外地干部领取补助粮问题，本应由人事局主办；但是，今年六月三日，察哈尔大同县人民政府遣送回京的干部关宝异，拿着证明信到人事局请领补助粮时，该局主管科并未接见，只叫传达员将证明拿去看了一下，就毫不负责地叫他去所在区人民政府——前第七区人民政府解决。区人民政府没有办过这种工作，又推到市府。市府秘书厅主管秘书也不知该谁办，经与民政局联系后叫关宝异去民政局。民政局与人事局联系后又叫他去区人民政府。因为区人民政府还是不能解决他的问题，关宝异又到了市府。市府秘书厅主管秘书又与区人民政府和人事局联系后，又叫他去区人民政府。就这样不负责任地推来推去，一直迟到六月十五日才把问题解决。有的单位仅仅将来信照抄照转，甚至把反映干部作风的来信一直转到被告人手里，使写信人大为不满。工商局前行政处副处长陈纪甚至粗暴地认为群众的一封来信“反映情况不实”，竟将来信撕毁。还有一些单位制度不够健全，不是简单从事，事后难以检查，就是手续繁多，工作效率很低。还有一个最普遍的缺点是：对群众提出的问题只习惯于个别处理，缺乏分析、综合，不能及时从这项工作中很好地领会群众的要求，从而改进工作，改进领导；特别对于带有普遍性的问题缺乏研究，因此就不能主动地系统地解决问题。
    彭真市长为继续加强处理人民来信和接见人民群众的工作，已指示各单位负责人必须每半月检查一次。市人民政府也已决定加强对人民来信的综合研究工作，以系统地解决带有普遍性的问题。此外并决定继续健全各种制度，并根据工作需要适当加强干部力量。
