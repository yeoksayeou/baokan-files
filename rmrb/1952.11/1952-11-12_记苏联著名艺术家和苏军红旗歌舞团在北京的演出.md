    Reporting on the Performances of Famous Soviet Artists and the Soviet Red Flag Song and Dance Ensemble in Beijing
    By our reporter Bai Sheng
    During the time when all the Chinese people are celebrating the 35th anniversary of the great socialist October Revolution and the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month," our guests—the most beloved friends, Soviet People's Artists, Honored Artists, famous artists, and the Soviet Red Flag Song and Dance Ensemble—held grand performances in Beijing.
    This is a performance of great significance. For many days, the people of Beijing have been eagerly waiting and looking forward to it. This day has finally arrived. Thanks to these brilliant performances, winter in Beijing has become warmer and more joyful.
    I was fortunate enough to see one of the performances. In this performance, from beginning to end, every program was warmly welcomed by the audience, and every performance gave people a very pleasant, beautiful, and noble feeling; whether it was singing or dancing, it made people feel the happy life of the Soviet people and the great achievements of Soviet art. But I feel that the only regret is that I was not able to see the wonderful performance of the outstanding ballet dancer Ulanova.
    When the famous Soviet opera singer Mikhailov first appeared on the stage, people immediately responded with warm applause. This singer from the Moscow Grand Theatre is not only familiar to and loved by the Soviet people but also familiar to and loved by the Chinese people. Audiences who have seen the Soviet film "Grand Concert" will never forget his performance of "Ivan Susanin," the simple and patriotic peasant who gave his life for his country. His sincere performance brought tears to people's eyes. Today, he sang "Toast to Moscow" and the Russian folk song "Song of the Volga Boatmen." His loud, deep voice and moving expression moved all the audience. His range is particularly wide, his pronunciation is extremely natural and full of emotion, and people were all intoxicated by his singing. His "Song of the Volga Boatmen" vividly unfolded a picture of the Volga River in the past before the audience's eyes: people listened quietly, holding their breath, as if they saw the boatmen laboriously pulling the tow rope on the riverbank getting closer and closer, and then gradually walking away. This Russian folk song, which the Chinese people are very familiar with, gave us a completely new feeling in his performance. When his singing stopped, people seemed to wake up from the painting, and immediately burst into stormy applause, and all the audience was moved by his touching singing. At the enthusiastic request of the audience, he came out again and sang a Russian folk song "Along Peter Street."
    Soviet People's Artist, Stalin Prize winner Zoya Gaidai sang "Dear Stalin" and a passage from Tchaikovsky's opera "The Sorceress." This excellent opera singer once created a moving image of the heroine in Tchaikovsky's opera. Her performance of Tatyana in "Eugene Onegin" profoundly portrayed the complex emotional changes of the heroine. She has a very high position in Soviet opera singing. Today, her velvet-like singing also attracted all the Chinese audience.
    When Soviet People's Artist, Stalin Prize winner Halima Nasyrova sang "Peace Song of the Uzbek Girl" and "Kazakh Waltz," her tone was mellow and full of power, with the unique bright voice of the Orientals, which shook the audience. People especially welcomed her singing of the "Kazakh Waltz." This song movingly depicts the joy of the Soviet people. Her performance, full of national characteristics, made the Chinese audience feel more cordial. In these songs, people sometimes felt as if they were under a clear sky, sometimes as if they were on a vast prairie, and sometimes as if they were in a deep valley. The laughter from the bottom of her heart and the laughter of the audience were completely integrated. This outstanding singer was warmly welcomed by the audience, and after five curtain calls, she was invited by the audience to sing another song, "Victory."
    People's Artist of the Azerbaijan Republic, Stalin Prize winner Rashid Behbutov's solo "Singing Cotton-Picking Girls" and a section from the song and dance drama "Peddler" were very wonderful; especially when he sang the Chinese folk song "In That Distant Place," he was repeatedly applauded by the audience, and he successfully expressed the style of Chinese folk songs. Soviet radio actor Nechayev's solo "Red Bean" and "Motherland" sang the deep and sincere emotions in Russian folk songs.
    International competition winners Leonid Kogan and Kavelzneva's violin solos "Fantasia" and "Dance" were based on the tune of the famous opera "Carmen" and the latter was a work by Chinese composer Ma Sicong. Through their fingers, they movingly explained the connotation of these two pieces of music, and the touching sound of the violin deeply touched the hearts of the audience. Honored Artist of the Russian Republic Nina Yemelyanova's piano solo brilliantly performed the "Toccata" by Soviet composer Khachaturian.
    People's Artist of the Uzbek Republic Tamara Khanum's song and dance—the Chinese folk song "Ode to Stalin, Mao Zedong," the Korean folk song "Sweet Root," and the Soviet folk song "Cotton Picking Song and Dance"—was a unique performance of singing and dancing; with the accompaniment of instruments, her dance and singing also changed in many ways, fully demonstrating the beautiful creation of folk song and dance.
    Moscow Opera and Ballet Theatre actors Sokolova and Pomazkov's ballet "Hunter and Bird" gave people a very beautiful feeling. The light and graceful dance, as well as the moving image creation, delicately expressed the true emotions of the characters in the play.
    The famous puppet show actor, Stalin Prize winner Obraztsov performed the puppet shows "Lullaby," "Drunkard," and "Taming the Tiger." "Lullaby" is a performance of a mother's deep love for her baby. "Drunkard" uses sharp satire to ridicule that hypocritical love. A person drinks when he is in love, and he drinks when he is out of love. This kind of person is just a drunkard who vents his emotions with wine. "Taming the Tiger" illustrates an old Chinese saying: "Raising a tiger is asking for trouble." A tiger keeper tames a "tiger," but in the end, he is swallowed by this ferocious "tiger." This is an extremely wonderful and interesting program. In the hands of this outstanding actor, the puppet also becomes a living thing. It is hard to imagine that there is only one person performing on the stage. This outstanding actor has poured all his sincere emotions into this small puppet.
    Moscow State Circus actors Karachova and Puchcin's soft gymnastics performance is also an amazing program. That is definitely not the kind of movement that ordinary soft gymnastics can show, but a performance with a high degree of artistic accomplishment and superb skills. Moscow State Circus actor Chetoshvili's magic performance also has extremely skilled techniques.
    The performance of the Soviet Red Flag Song and Dance Ensemble, with People's Artist of the Russian Republic, Stalin Prize winner B. A. Alexandrov as artistic director and chief conductor, Honored Artist, Stalin Prize winner Vilski as dance director, Honored Artist, Stalin Prize winner Vinogradov as choral director, and Honored Artist of the Russian Republic V. A. Alexandrov as orchestra conductor, was also extremely wonderful. All the performances are full of the lively, cheerful, simple and energetic characteristics of Red Army soldiers. This song and dance troupe plays an extremely important role in the cultural life of the Red Army. Due to their outstanding achievements in their work, most of the members of the troupe have won Soviet state medals and awards.
    The chorus "Ode to Stalin" powerfully expressed the Soviet people's love for the great leader Stalin. The chorus "Echo," like the sound echoing in the valley, is beautiful and moving, and was repeatedly applauded by the audience at the meeting. The Red Flag Song and Dance Ensemble's chorus has highly developed the art of chorus on the basis of the people's choral art, and they sing so powerfully and emotionally.
    It should be especially mentioned that "Moscow-Beijing" is sung in both Chinese and Soviet languages, as well as the Chinese folk songs "The East is Red," "Coming in February," and "Lan Huahua" sung in Chinese. The fact that Soviet artists sing in Chinese makes the Chinese audience feel particularly cordial. These excellent soloists and chorus members not only sang the feelings of the Chinese people but also sang the Soviet people's love for the Chinese people. From these performances, people can see how the Soviet people love Chinese art.
    The "Grand Military Dance" and "Saber Dance" performed by the Red Flag Song and Dance Ensemble were also wonderful programs that were warmly welcomed by the audience. The first part of the "Grand Military Dance" uses dance to express the victory parade of the Soviet army after defeating the German fascist bandits. Various excellent arms of the service appeared on the stage, tank soldiers, artillery soldiers, air force soldiers, navy soldiers, infantry soldiers, and cavalry soldiers, as well as young military school students, dancing happily. Then the second part is these soldiers and the beautiful girls who came to participate in the grand people's festival singing and dancing happily together. They danced various national dances, first the Belarusians danced the national dance, they danced the "Kryzhachok" dance, then the Ukrainians danced the "Hopak" dance, two Tatar girls danced lightly and happily, and then everyone danced the Georgian "Lesginka" dance, and finally, excellent dancers from various arms of the service and various ethnic groups held a competition. This dance fully demonstrates the invincible strength of the Soviet Red Army and the close relationship between the Soviet Red Army and the people of all ethnic groups. This dance also demonstrates the high artistic creation of the Soviet Red Army.
    This brilliant performance not only showed the superb art of the Soviet people but also showed the infinitely happy and beautiful life of the Soviet people. This time, the Soviet art working group and the Soviet Red Flag Song and Dance Ensemble came to China, which will give a huge impact on the Chinese people's artistic life and will further deepen the brotherly friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people.

    记苏联著名艺术家和苏军红旗歌舞团在北京的演出
    本报记者  柏生
    在全中国人民欢庆伟大的社会主义十月革命三十五周年和“中苏友好月”的时候，我们的嘉宾——最亲爱的友人，苏联的人民演员、功勋演员、著名艺术家和苏军红旗歌舞团在北京连续举行了盛大的演出。
    这是一个带有重大意义的演出。多少天来，北京的人们就在热情地等待着，盼望着。这个日子终于来到了。由于这些光辉的演出，使冬天的北京变得温暖和更欢乐了。
    记者很幸运地看了一次演出。在这次演出中，从开始到结束，没有一个节目不是受到观众热烈欢迎的，没有一个表演不给人一种极愉快的优美的和高尚的情感；无论是歌唱、还是舞蹈，都使人感到苏联人民的幸福生活，和苏维埃人民艺术的巨大成就。但记者感到不足的是，没能看到杰出的巴蕾舞演员乌兰诺娃的精彩表演。
    当苏联著名的歌剧演员米哈伊洛夫，刚一出现在舞台上时，人们立即报以热烈的掌声。这位莫斯科大剧院的歌唱家，不仅为苏联人民所熟悉，所热爱，也为中国人民所熟悉，所热爱。看过苏联电影“大音乐会”的观众，都忘记不了他演唱的“伊凡·苏沙宁”，那纯朴、爱国的农民，为了祖国付出了生命。他的真挚的表演，使人热泪盈眶。今天他又演唱了“为莫斯科干杯”和俄罗斯民歌“伏尔加船夫曲”。宏亮、浑厚的歌声和动人的表情感动了所有的观众。他的音域特别宽大，发音极其自然而富于情感，人们都沉醉在他的歌声里了。他的“伏尔加船夫曲”，在听众面前生动地展开了一幅往昔的伏尔加河畔的图画：人们静听着，屏息着，就好像看见在河岸上吃力地拉着纤绳的船夫们越来越近了，又一步步地走远了。这首中国人民非常熟悉的俄罗斯民歌，在他的演唱中给我们一种全新的感受。当他的歌声停止时，人们才仿佛从画境里惊醒，立刻报以暴风雨般的掌声，所有的观众都为他的动人的歌唱而感动。在观众的热烈要求下，他又走出来唱了一支俄罗斯民歌“沿着彼得大街”。
    苏联人民演员、斯大林奖金获得者卓娅·盖达伊独唱了“亲爱的斯大林”和柴可夫斯基的歌剧“魔女”中的一段。这位优秀的歌剧演员，曾经在柴可夫斯基的歌剧中创造了女主角的动人形象。她演唱“尤金·奥涅金”中的塔梯雅娜，深刻地刻划了女主角的复杂的情感的变化。在苏联歌剧演唱上有着极高的地位。今天，她的天鹅绒一样的歌声，也同样地吸引了所有的中国听众。
    当苏联人民演员、斯大林奖金获得者、哈利马·纳赛罗娃独唱“乌兹别克女郎的和平之歌”和“哈萨克圆舞曲”时，她的音质圆润而充满力量，有着东方人那种特有的嘹亮的歌喉，震动了全场的听众。人们特别欢迎她歌唱的“哈萨克圆舞曲”。这首歌曲动人地描写了苏维埃人民的欢乐。她的富有民族色彩的演唱，更使中国听众感到亲切。在这些歌曲中，使人时而感觉到好像是在晴朗的天空下，时而又像是在辽阔的草原上，时而又好像是在深邃的山谷中。从她的心底深处发出的欢笑的歌声，和听众的欢笑的心情完全融成了一片。这个出色的歌唱家受到了全场观众热烈的欢迎，在五次谢幕之后，她又被观众邀请高歌了一支歌曲“胜利”。
    阿塞拜疆共和国人民演员、斯大林奖金获得者、拉西德·裴布托夫的独唱“歌唱采棉的姑娘”和歌舞剧“货郎”中的一段都很精彩；尤其当他歌唱中国的民歌“在那遥远的地方”时，受到了观众的一再鼓掌欢迎，他成功地表现了中国民歌的风格。苏联广播演员聂恰耶夫的独唱“红豆”和“祖国”，唱出了俄罗斯民歌中的浑厚、深挚的感情。
    国际比赛获奖者、列奥尼得·柯岗和卡威尔兹涅娃的小提琴独奏“幻想曲”和“舞曲”，前者是根据著名的歌剧“卡门”的曲调作成，后者是中国作曲家马思聪的作品。通过了他们的手指，动人地解释了这两首乐曲的内涵，提琴的感人的声音，深深地打入了听众的心灵深处。俄罗斯共和国功勋演员尼娜·叶美里扬诺娃的钢琴独奏，出色地演奏了苏联作曲家哈恰都梁的“触敲曲”。
    乌兹别克共和国人民演员塔马拉·哈侬的歌舞——中国民歌“歌颂斯大林、毛泽东”、朝鲜民歌“甜根”以及苏联民歌“采棉歌舞曲”，是别具一种民族风格的载歌载舞的表演；随着乐器的伴奏，她的舞蹈和歌唱也千变万化，充分表现了民间歌舞的优美创造。
    莫斯科歌舞剧院演员索科洛娃和波马兹科夫的巴蕾舞“猎人与鸟”，给人们一种极美好的感觉。那轻盈、优美的舞姿，以及动人的形象创造，细致地表现了剧中人的真实的情感。
    著名的木偶戏演员，斯大林奖金获得者奥布拉兹卓夫表演了木偶戏“摇篮曲”、“醉鬼”和“驯虎”。“摇篮曲”是表演母亲对自己婴儿的挚爱。“醉鬼”是用辛辣的讽刺，嘲笑了那种虚伪的爱情。一个人他恋爱时喝酒，失恋也要喝酒。这种人不过是一个用酒发泄感情的醉鬼罢了。“驯虎”说明了我国的一句古话：“养虎贻患”。一个养虎者，驯养着一只“虎”，但最后却被这只凶恶的“虎”吞食了。这是一个极其精彩和有趣味的节目。在这位卓越的演员手中，木偶也变成了一个有生命的东西。人们很难以想像舞台上只有他一个人在表演。这位卓越的演员，把他的真挚的情感都灌注在这小小的木偶身上了。
    莫斯科国家杂技团演员卡拉巧娃和普奇岑的柔软体操表演，也是一个令人惊叹的节目。那绝不是我们普通所了解的一般柔软体操所能表现出来的动作，而是具有着高度艺术修养和卓越技术的表演。莫斯科国家杂技团演员契托希维利表演的魔术，也有着极其纯熟的技术。
    由俄罗斯共和国人民演员、斯大林奖金获得者鲍·亚·亚历山大罗夫任艺术指导兼总指挥，功勋艺术家、斯大林奖金获得者维尔斯基任舞蹈总指导，功勋艺术家、斯大林奖金获得者维诺格拉陀夫任合唱总指导，俄罗斯共和国功勋演员符·亚·亚历山大罗夫任乐队指挥的苏军红旗歌舞团的表演，也是极其精彩的。全部表演节目，充满了红军战士的活泼、明朗、朴素而有生气的特点。这个歌舞团在红军的文化生活中起着极其重要的作用。由于他们工作上的杰出的成绩，大部分的团员都获得了苏联的国家勋章和奖章。
    歌舞团的大合唱“斯大林颂”，强有力地表现了苏联人民对伟大领袖斯大林的热爱。大合唱“回声”，像在山谷中回荡着的音响，幽美而动人，受到了会场观众的一再鼓掌欢迎。红旗歌舞团的合唱队在人民的合唱艺术的基础上，高度发展了合唱艺术，他们演唱得那么有力而富于情感。
    应该特别提到的，是用中苏两国语言歌唱的“莫斯科—北京”以及用中国语言唱出的中国民歌“东方红”“二月里来”“蓝花花”。苏联的艺术家用中国语言来演唱，这个事实本身就使中国观众感到特别亲切。这些优秀的独唱演员和合唱队员，不仅歌唱出了中国人民的感情，也歌唱出了苏联人民对中国人民的热爱。从这些表演中，人们可以看到苏联人民是怎样热爱中国的艺术。
    红旗歌舞团演出的“大军舞”和“马刀舞”也是受到全场观众热烈欢迎的精彩的节目。“大军舞”的第一部分是用舞蹈来表现苏军战胜德国法西斯匪帮之后的胜利大检阅。在舞台上出现了各种优秀兵种，坦克手、炮兵、空军、海军、步兵和骑兵，以及年青的军事学校的学生，他们愉快地舞着。接着第二部分是这些士兵和前来参加盛大人民节日的美丽的姑娘们一起欢欣地歌舞着。他们跳着各种民族舞，先是白俄罗斯人跳民族舞，他们跳的是“克雷查乔克”舞，接着乌克兰人跳起了“弋巴克”舞，两个鞑靼姑娘轻松愉快地幸福地轻舞着，接着大家又跳起格鲁吉亚的“列士根卡”舞，最后各兵种和各民族优秀的舞蹈家举行了竞赛。这个舞蹈充分表现了苏联红军不可战胜的力量，和苏联红军和各民族人民的亲密的关系。这个舞蹈也表现了苏联红军高度的艺术创造。
    这次光辉的演出，不仅表现了苏维埃人民的高超的艺术，也表现了苏维埃人民无限幸福美好的生活。这次苏联艺术工作团和苏军红旗歌舞团来到中国，将给中国人民艺术生活以巨大的影响，将更加深中苏两国人民兄弟般的友谊。（附图片）
