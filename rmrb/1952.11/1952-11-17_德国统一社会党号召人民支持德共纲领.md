Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, November 15th (TASS): The German News Agency reported: The Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany issued a statement regarding the program for striving to restore national unity in Germany, which was published by the German Communist Party.

The statement said: The program for striving to restore national unity in Germany is of great historical significance. At a time when the Adenauer government is trying its best to have the "General Treaty" and the Paris Treaty, which stipulates the establishment of West German mercenary forces, ratified and force the people to accept these treaties, the German Communist Party has bravely raised the banner of striving for German national unity and independence. The German Communist Party calls on all patriots, regardless of their worldview and party interests, to unite in a massive patriotic movement to fight for peace and national unity, and for the democratic rights and national independence of the people. The German Communist Party's program points out to the people of West Germany the path to a peaceful solution to the German question, the elimination of poverty, and a path toward lasting prosperity.

The statement continued: Only by breaking away from the US's war preparations, aggression and delusion of establishing world domination, and embarking on the path of peace, unity and democracy, can the people of West Germany have a happy future.

The statement pointed out: "If the patriotic people of West Germany can unite within a broad democratic German national front, just as the patriotic people of East Germany have done, the German people will become masters of their own destiny. The patriotic people of West Germany can be assured that their just struggle will surely receive the firm support of the people of the German Democratic Republic, the Soviet people, and all peace-loving people."

The statement emphasized: "The Second Congress of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany has adopted a resolution pointing out that all democratic forces in the German Democratic Republic have a responsibility to strengthen fraternal solidarity with the German Communist Party. In accordance with this resolution, we call on all patriots, all good German people, to support the program for restoring German national unity."

    德国统一社会党号召人民支持德共纲领
    【新华社十五日讯】据塔斯社柏林十四日讯：德意志通讯社报道：德国统一社会党中央委员会就德国共产党公布的争取恢复德国全国统一的纲领发表声明。
    声明说：争取恢复德国全国统一的纲领，是具有重大历史意义的。在阿登纳政府竭力使“一般性条约”以及规定成立西德雇佣军的巴黎条约得以批准并强迫人民接受这些条约的时候，德国共产党勇敢地举起了争取德国全国统一和独立的大旗。德国共产党号召全体爱国人士，不论世界观以及党派利益有何不同，一齐团结在争取和平与全国统一、争取人民的民主权利与民族独立的声势浩大的爱国运动之中。德国共产党的纲领向西德人民指出了和平解决德国问题、消灭贫困、走向持久繁荣的道路。
    声明接着说：西德人民只有同美国的备战侵略和妄想建立世界统治的政策割断关系，并走上和平、统一与民主的道路，才能有幸福的前途。
    声明指出：“如果西德的爱国人民，也能像东德的爱国人民一样，团结在广泛的民主德国全国阵线之内，德国人民就将成为自己的命运的主人。西德的爱国人民可以确信，他们的正义斗争，必能获得德意志民主共和国的人民、苏联人民以及全体爱好和平的人民的坚决支持。”
    声明强调说：“德国统一社会党第二次代表会议曾经通过一个决定，指出德意志民主共和国一切民主力量都有责任加强与德国共产党兄弟般的团结。根据这个决定，我们号召所有爱国人士，所有善良的德国人民支持恢复德国全国统一的纲领。”
