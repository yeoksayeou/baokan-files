Massively cultivating and promoting cadres is an important method to solve the problem of cadres holding too many concurrent positions and employees having too much free time. Over the past three years, the Shijingshan Power Plant has cultivated and promoted Party, administrative, trade union, and Communist Youth League cadres at the level of group leader and above from among the workers, accounting for 17 percent of the total number of employees in the plant. Among them, those promoted to the section and division levels and above account for 7.5 percent of the total number of employees in the plant. Recently, in order to implement the decision of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China on rationally distributing employees' spare time and to completely solve the problem of cadres holding too many concurrent positions, the plant promoted another group of cadres. The newly promoted cadres account for 17.4 percent of the original total number of cadres. In this way, except for one person, all cadres above the level of workshop director in the plant no longer hold concurrent positions. Only sixty-six cadres below the level of workshop director hold one concurrent position, and six hold two concurrent positions. This has basically solved the difficulties of cadres holding too many concurrent positions and being unable to do their work well, and it has pointed out a practical and feasible path for those enterprise leaders who lack confidence in cultivating worker cadres and only know how to reach out to higher authorities for personnel.

These newly promoted cadres are all enthusiastic, willing to work hard, and responsible, and they are able to complete the tasks assigned to them by the Party and the country. Most of them have also demonstrated creativity and made new achievements in their new positions. The letters from comrades Lu Zengzhi and Tian Jialian, published in this column today, specifically reflect this fact.

The main reason why the Shijingshan Power Plant has been able to boldly promote cadres is that the leading cadres of the plant believe in the masses of workers and believe that the liberated workers are fully capable of managing their own factories well. Therefore, they can consciously cultivate and promote cadres from among the workers to solve the difficulty of insufficient cadres. They attach great importance to cultivating and promoting Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members, and they also pay great attention to cultivating and promoting worker activists who have emerged in various struggles and movements. They know that whether they are young workers, older workers, or technicians, whether they are Party members or the masses, as long as they are willing to accept the Party's education and can work actively with the attitude of masters of their own affairs, they should be boldly cultivated and promoted. They consciously oppose the simplistic "talent" view that "workers have no culture" or "workers cannot speak," and they also oppose the narrow view of not daring to rely on the masses more broadly.

According to the experience of the Shijingshan Power Plant, when cultivating and promoting cadres, it is necessary to grasp the principle of cultivating and promoting cadres according to the needs of actual work. When the plant implemented the branch-based responsibility system, it boldly promoted branch directors. Promoting cadres to practical work positions and giving them practical training is the most effective way to cultivate cadres. The newly promoted cadres of the plant generally reflect that they can only progress faster in actual work. Because they will encounter many difficulties in actual work, they must use their brains, think of more ways, and ask the leading cadres for instructions more often, so they will receive more education.

The specific methods for cultivating cadres in the plant are: (1) Set up more deputy positions; (2) Appropriately allow lower-level cadres to attend upper-level meetings; (3) Conduct systematic education for cadres on theory, policies, and working methods; (4) Provide specific assistance to newly promoted cadres.

    大量培养和提拔工人干部
    ——读者来信述评
    大量培养和提拔干部，是解决干部兼职过多，职工业余活动时间过长的问题的重要方法。石景山发电厂三年来从工人中培养并提拔的党、行政、工会、青年团的小组长以上的干部，占全厂职工总人数的百分之十七；其中提拔为科、股级以上的干部，占全厂职工总人数百分之七点五。最近该厂为了执行中共北京市委关于合理支配职工业余活动时间的决定，彻底解决干部兼职过多的问题，又提拔了一批干部。这次新提拔起来的干部，占原来干部总数百分之十七点四。这样，全厂车间主任以上的干部，除了一个人以外，都不兼职了；车间主任以下的干部，只有六十六人兼一职，六人兼两职了。这就基本上解决了干部兼职过多、无法把工作做好的困难，并且给那些对培养工人干部缺乏信心，只知伸手向上级要人的企业领导干部，指出了一条切实可行的道路。
    这些新提拔起来的干部，都是热情肯干，勇于负责，能够完成党和国家给予他们的任务；其中大多数人并且发挥了创造精神，在新的工作岗位上做出了新的成绩。今天本栏发表的陆增芝、田家廉等同志的来信，就具体地反映了这一事实。
    石景山发电厂所以能够大胆放手提拔干部，主要是由于该厂领导干部相信工人群众，相信解放了的工人是完全能够把自己的工厂管理好的。因此，他们就能自觉地从工人当中培养和提拔干部，以解决干部不够的困难。他们十分重视培养和提拔共产党员和青年团员，也十分注意培养和提拔在各种斗争和运动中涌现出的工人积极分子。他们知道，不管是青年工人、老年工人或技术人员，不管是党员或群众，只要他愿意接受党的教育，能够以主人翁的姿态积极工作，都应该放手加以培养和提拔。他们自觉地反对了那种嫌“工人没有文化”、嫌“工人不会讲话”的单纯“人才”观点，也反对了那种不敢更广泛地依靠群众的狭隘观点。
    根据石景山发电厂的经验，在培养和提拔干部的时候，必须掌握按照实际工作的需要来培养、提拔干部的原则。该厂实行分场负责制时，便放手提拔场主任。把干部提拔到实际工作岗位上，给以实际的锻炼，这是培养干部的最有效的方法。该厂新提拔起来的干部普遍反映：只有在实际工作中才能更快地进步。因为在实际工作中会遇到很多困难，必须开动脑筋，多想办法，必须多向领导干部请示，这样受到的教育也就多了。
    该厂培养干部的具体方法是：（一）多设副职；
    （二）适当地多让下级干部列席参加上级的会议；
    （三）对干部进行系统的理论、政策和工作方法的教育；（四）具体帮助新提拔的干部。
