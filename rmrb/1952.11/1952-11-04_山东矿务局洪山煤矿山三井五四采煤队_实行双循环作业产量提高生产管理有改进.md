Hongshan Coal Mine No. 3 Well No. 54 Coal Mining Team of Shandong Mining Bureau
Implements Double-Cycle Operation to Increase Production and Improve Production Management

Since the No. 54 Coal Mining Team of Hongshan Coal Mine No. 3 Well of Shandong Mining Bureau began to implement double-cycle operations in June last year, it has achieved remarkable results, increased production, improved equipment utilization, and greatly improved the management level of the entire working face. It is currently conducting experiments with triple-cycle operations.

Before June of last year, although No. 3 Well had a lifting capacity of 1,200 tons, the output was not that high. The reason was the thin coal seam (only 1.1 meters thick) and the small number of working faces (only two at the time). If production were to be increased, the number of working faces would have to be doubled according to the original method. However, increasing the number of working faces would also require more machinery, equipment, and management personnel, which would inevitably lead to a waste of manpower and resources. In order to solve this contradiction, the mine's leading cadres and workers, after a long period of deliberation, finally found a way, which was to increase the number of cycles and change from single-cycle operation to double-cycle operation. In other words, to increase the number of coal mining operations within the same period of time.

On the coal mining face, one pass of the coal cutting machine and the completion of coal extraction, transportation, and all supporting work by workers of various types for that pass is called a cycle. Completing one cycle in twenty-four hours is called single-cycle operation; the No. 54 Coal Mining Team of No. 3 Well originally used single-cycle operation. It is of course not easy to complete two cycles in twenty-four hours. Workers' operating skills must be very proficient, tools and equipment must be supplied in a timely and appropriate manner, and each process must be closely connected and coordinated. The No. 54 Coal Mining Team overcame many difficulties in the process of experimenting with double-cycle operations. It began experimenting in June last year and gradually got on the right track by June this year, and achieved remarkable results.

According to the experience of the No. 54 Coal Mining Team, the advantages of double-cycle operation are reflected in the following aspects: First, after the implementation of double-cycle operation, the coal mining progress is faster, the time the roof is suspended is shortened, and the risk of falling is reduced, which further ensures safe production. At the same time, the loss of props is also greatly reduced. The percentage of props that can be reused after recovery has increased from 20% in the past to 85% now. Second, the output has been greatly increased. The average daily output of single-cycle operation in the first half of 1951 was 271 tons, while the total average daily output for the twelve months from July 1951 to June this year, during which double-cycle operation was tested, reached 445.76 tons, an increase of 60.49%. Third, the utilization rate of mechanical equipment has been improved. In the past, during single-cycle operation, the average daily workload of the coal cutting machine was 187 square meters; in the first half of 1952, the daily average was 301.37 square meters. The transportation capacity of the electric chute has also increased by more than 60%. Fourth, labor productivity has been greatly improved. The average production efficiency per person on the working face has increased from 2.5 tons per day during single-cycle operation to 4.24 tons, an increase of 182%. Fifth, the working face is advanced quickly, shortening the maintenance time of the roadway and saving a lot of maintenance costs.

With the promotion of advanced production methods, the improvement of production management has been promoted, and the production management work has been greatly improved.

First, the problem of roof management has been solved. In the past, No. 3 Well used partial filling to support the roof of the mined-out area and reduce the pressure on the roof of the mining face. Due to various reasons, the roof often cracked, many wooden pillars were broken, the working face was often threatened by the roof, and the work was busy and passive, and the cycle operation was often interrupted. After adopting double-cycle operation, the speed of advancing the working face increased, and the filling work could not keep up, and the difficulties became even greater. Based on this situation, the leading cadres of No. 3 Well re-studied the nature of the roof and believed that the method of natural collapse of large caving could be implemented here. However, this opinion initially met with resistance from conservative ideas. Under the leadership of the Party, different opinions were persuaded, and in the process of experimentation, the advanced experience of the Soviet Union was studied, and the opinions of the workers were continuously absorbed. Finally, the method was gradually changed from manual roof release to natural collapse, and good results were obtained. The pressure on the working face was reduced, the phenomenon of roof cracking was eliminated, and the chaotic phenomenon on the working face caused by the threat of the roof was gone, creating favorable conditions for double-cycle operation.

Second, management personnel deeply understand the production process and effectively solve the problems in production. At the beginning of the double-cycle operation experiment, a series of difficulties were placed in front of them. In order to solve these difficulties, the management personnel of No. 3 Well made a specific analysis of the entire production process. They divided the entire production process into eight links, six supporting tasks, and more than a dozen actions, and conducted research on these aspects one by one. At the same time, they carefully measured the operation and mechanical operation. As a result, they grasped the systematic and specific situation and problems of the working face, and in response to these problems, they studied together with the workers and made improvements in management and operation techniques: for example, repairing the chain of the electric chute, reducing and balancing the load of the electric chute, overcoming the problem of frequent chain breakage; ensuring the specifications of the working face to avoid hindering the operation of the coal cutting machine; expanding the parking lot, adjusting the coal output time of each working face, and supplying mine cars on time and in quantity, so that transportation could keep up with the needs of coal mining. After these reforms, the underground production outlook has been greatly changed, the disconnection and chaos have been eliminated, and the cycle operation can be carried out smoothly.

Third, the form of charts was improved, and the guiding role of charts in production was brought into play. Double-cycle operation is an extremely complex production process. Every worker must understand their work location, work time, work quantity, work specifications, and their position in the entire production process. Such a complex problem cannot be easily understood and remembered by workers by oral explanation alone. The most effective method is to use cycle charts to manage production, and accurately organize the organization of labor, the different working times of each type of work, the work location, the work quantity, and the engineering specifications and quality into the cycle charts. Workers complete their work according to the instructions of the charts, and production can be carried out rhythmically. In the past, No. 3 Well also had instruction charts. However, the past charts mostly used lines and text to represent, and were only in the office, and could not meet the workers, and the masses could not understand them. After the double-cycle operation started, the engineers listened to the opinions of the workers in many ways, and changed the cycle charts into schematic drawings according to the image of the operation or tools, and hung them on the site to explain to the workers. After the chart was improved, grassroots cadres and workers were able to carry out their work according to the instructions of the chart.

Fourth, in the process of implementing double-cycle operation, the labor organization was improved, and the phenomenon of idling was eliminated. When the No. 54 Coal Mining Team was in single-cycle operation, it had already fixed the labor organization according to the workload and the nature of the work. When implementing double-cycle operation, they divided the independent working part - roof management - into a separate shift, and divided the thirteen types of work of the entire team into five shifts, namely, one pillar removal shift, two electric chute moving shifts, and two coal mining shifts. At the same time, according to the progress of the cycle, the working time of each type of work was staggered, and the cross-working method was implemented. This allows different types of work to rotate on the coal mining face for twenty-four hours, without hindering each other, and can closely cooperate, and the mechanical equipment also has a fixed rest time. This scientific labor organization is an important guarantee for the normal operation of double-cycle operation.

    实行双循环作业产量提高生产管理有改进
    山东矿务局洪山煤矿山三井五四采煤队，从去年六月开始试行双循环作业以来，已经取得显著成绩，增加了产量，提高了设备利用率，整个工作面的管理工作水平，也大大提高了一步。目前正在进行三循环作业的试验。
    去年六月以前，山三井虽有一千二百吨的提升能力，但是产量却没有这样多。原因是煤层薄（仅一点一公尺厚），工作面少（当时只有两个）。如果要提高产量，按原来的办法，就须要增加一倍的工作面。而工作面的增加，也就要增加机械设备和管理人员，势必形成人力物力的浪费。为了解决这个矛盾，该矿领导干部和工人经过长时间的酝酿，终于找到了门径，这就是增加循环次数，改单循环作业为双循环作业。也就是说，要在同一时间内增加采煤次数。
    在采煤工作面上，割煤机拉一次槽，各工种的工人把这一槽子煤采完、运完，并做完一切配合工作，叫做一个循环。在二十四小时内，做完一个循环叫做单循环作业；山三井五四采煤队原来就是单循环作业。要在二十四小时中做到两个循环，当然是不容易的，工人的操作技术必须十分熟练，工具器材要供应得及时应手，各个工序要紧密衔接动作协调。五四采煤队在实验双循环作业的过程中，曾经克服了许多困难，从去年六月开始试验，到今年六月已逐渐走上正轨，并收到了显著的成绩。
    根据五四采煤队的经验，双循环作业的优越性表现在以下各方面：一、实行双循环作业后，采煤进度快，顶板悬空的时间缩短，下落的危险减少，进一步保证了安全生产。同时支柱的损失也大大减少，支柱回收后能再度使用者，过去是百分之二十，现在已达百分之八十五。二、产量大大提高，一九五一年上半年单循环平均日产二百七十一吨，而一九五一年七月至今年六月试行双循环作业的十二个月，总平均日产量已达四百四十五点七六吨，产量提高百分之六十点四九。三、提高了机械设备利用率。过去单循环时，割煤机每日平均工作量是一百八十七平方公尺，一九五二年上半年，每日平均完成三百零一点三七平方公尺；电溜子运输能力也提高了百分之六十以上。四、劳动生产效率大大提高。工作面每人平均生产效率从单循环时每天二点五吨提高到四点二四吨，提高了百分之一百八十二。五、工作面推进得快，缩短了巷道维持时间，节省了大量的维持费用。
    随着先进生产方法的推广，推动了生产管理工作的改进，使生产管理工作大大提高一步。
    第一、解决了顶板管理问题。过去，山三井是采取部分充填的办法，来支撑已采区的顶板，减轻采煤面顶板的压力。由于各种原因，顶板常常破裂，木柱压断很多，工作面经常受到顶板的威胁，工作忙乱被动，循环作业常常中断。采用双循环作业后，工作面推进速度加快，充填工作跟不上，困难就更多了。根据这种情况，山三井的领导干部对顶板性质重新进行了研究，认为该处可以实行大冒顶的自然陷落的方法。但是这一意见，最初曾经遇到了保守思想的抵抗。在党的领导下，说服了不同的意见，在试验的过程中又研究了苏联的先进经验，不断地吸取工人群众的意见，终于逐步由人工放顶改为自然陷落的方法，而且获得良好的结果。工作面上的压力减轻了，顶板破裂现象消除了，工作面上由于顶板威胁而形成的混乱现象也再没有了，为双循环作业创造了有利条件。
    第二、管理人员深入了解生产过程，切实地解决了生产中的问题。双循环作业试验开始，一系列的困难摆在面前，为了解决这些困难，山三井的管理人员把整个生产过程作了具体分析。他们把整个生产过程，分为八个环节、六项配合工作、和十多个动作，对这些方面逐一进行了研究，同时对操作和机械运转进行了仔细的测定。从而他们掌握了工作面的系统的具体的情况和问题，并针对这些问题，和工人共同研究，在管理工作和操作技术方面分别进行了改进：例如检修电溜子的链条、减轻并平衡电溜子的负荷，克服了经常断链的毛病；保证工作面的规格，以免阻碍割煤机的运行；扩大了停车场，调整了各工作面的出煤时间，定时定量供给车皮，使运搬赶上采煤的需要。进行了这些改革以后，井下生产面貌大大改变，消除了脱节混乱现象，使循环作业得以顺利进行。
    第三、改进图表形式，发挥了图表对生产的指导作用。双循环作业是一个极其复杂的生产过程。每一个工人都必须了解自己的工作地点、工作时间、工作数量、工作规格以及自己在整个生产中的地位。这样复杂的问题，单靠口头讲解是不容易让工人懂得并记住的。最有效的方法是运用循环图表来管理生产，把劳动力的组织、每一工种的不同工作时间、工作地点、工作数量、工程规格质量等都准确地组织在循环图表内，工人们根据图表的指示来完成自己的工作，生产就可以有节奏地进行。过去山三井也有指示图表。但是，过去的图表多是用线条和文字表示，并且只是在办公室里，不能与工人群众见面，群众也看不懂。双循环作业开始后，工程师们多方面听取工人意见，按照操作或工具的形象，把循环图表改成示意图画，并把它挂到现场，向工人讲解。改进图表以后，基层干部和工人都能够根据图表的指示，进行工作。
    第四、在实行双循环作业的过程中，改进了劳动组织，消灭了窝工现象。五四采煤队在单循环作业时，已经做到根据工作量和工作性质使劳动组织固定。实行双循环作业时，他们又把有独立性的工作部分——顶板管理——单独划为一班，把全队十三个工种划为五个班，即一个撤柱班、两个移电溜子班、两个采煤班。同时，根据循环的进度，把各个工种的工作时间交叉开，实行了交叉工作法。使二十四小时内，采煤工作面上都有不同的工种在轮流工作，既不互相妨碍，又能密切配合，机械设备也有了固定的休息时间。这种科学的劳动组织是双循环作业能够正常进行的一个重要保证。
