Xinhua News Agency, New York, November 23rd: According to TASS, the Sixth (Legal) Committee of the United Nations General Assembly is discussing the definition of the term "aggression." As world public opinion increasingly demands that the United Nations stop aggressors, this issue, which is highly important in the current international situation, has attracted great attention from many national delegations. At the committee meetings, representatives from Afghanistan, Iran, Indonesia, and Egypt emphasized the need to define aggression in order to condemn aggressive policies manifested in various forms. The Afghan representative said that small and weak countries particularly feel the need to define aggression because they are constantly suffering from open and covert aggression. The Iranian representative strongly argued for the necessity of defining aggression, citing many facts illustrating Britain's aggressive policy towards Iran.

Representatives from the United States, Britain, and other countries that follow the United States, while speaking on this issue, raised various absurd excuses in an attempt to prevent the United Nations from adopting a resolution that clearly and explicitly defines aggression, because such a resolution would provide peace-loving countries and peoples with a weapon to fight against the aggressive policies of the US-British bloc.

US Representative Glenn and British Representative Fitzmaurice opposed giving any definition to aggression. They preposterously distorted historical facts in an attempt to prove that defining aggression is theoretically impossible and practically unnecessary. The Venezuelan representative said that the current tense international situation is not suitable for resolving the issue of defining aggression. However, everyone understands that it is precisely because of the threat of aggressive wars launched by the North Atlantic bloc that the United Nations has an even greater obligation to define aggression and expose aggressors in various guises.

At the committee meeting on November 21, Soviet Foreign Minister Vyshinsky delivered a speech exposing the absurdity of the reasons cited by the representatives of the North Atlantic aggressive bloc for opposing the definition of aggression, and specified the necessity and possibility of giving a clear definition to aggression.

In his long speech, Vyshinsky analyzed the international situation over the past few years. He pointed out in his speech that the Soviet proposal to the Sixth Committee included a scientific definition of aggression, which answers the demands of all peace-loving nations and countries.

Xinhua News Agency, New York, November 23rd: According to TASS, the Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly continued to discuss the Korean issue on the 20th. At the beginning of the meeting, British Foreign Secretary Eden delivered a brief speech. He avoided mentioning the Soviet proposal and did not respond to the recent speeches by the head of the Soviet delegation and the representatives of Belarus, Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Ukraine.

Eden praised the so-called "voluntary repatriation" principle, which was fabricated to cover up the US military command's refusal to repatriate Korean and Chinese prisoners of war, and then emphasized that he believed there was no difference between the Indian proposal and the British delegation's claims in recognizing this "principle."

In particular, the US delegation, which until recently had pretended that the Indian proposal was not to its liking, has also stopped attacking the Indian proposal. It is rumored in journalistic circles that the US government has decided to adopt a favorable attitude towards this proposal.

This is understandable: in fact, the Indian proposal does not represent anything; it is merely a slightly disguised American proposal. Indeed, if the verbal embellishments were removed from the Indian proposal, it would reveal its true form—it is based on the same absurd principle of forced screening and detention of prisoners of war in violation of the Geneva Convention of August 12, 1949; for appearances sake, this principle is concealed by some hypocritical arguments about prisoners of war "voluntarily choosing" to go home or to remain permanently in a foreign land far from their homes and relatives.

As for the repatriation commission established by the Indian proposal, its function in fact ultimately amounts to performing the duties of a concentration camp management authority, where prisoners of war will suffer indefinitely in such camps after the end of the war.

It is not difficult to see that the country that proposed this proposal wants these prisoners of war to suffer the tragic fate of wartime displaced persons, who were first forcibly detained in concentration camps by Western countries after World War II, and then handed over to landlords and capitalists in the United States, Latin America, Australia, and other countries for their enslavement.

This is the actual situation, as Eden's speech demonstrates. Eden expressed the hope that the Indian proposal would provide for the establishment of some kind of commission to resettle prisoners of war. Eden said: The Indian proposal does not stipulate the repatriation of all Korean and Chinese prisoners of war after the cessation of hostilities, and he added: a commission must be established to resettle them.

Eden also said that the Indian proposal should specify that the "arbitrator" selected by the repatriation commission must be a member of the commission and must be the chairman of the commission. In this way, the "arbitrator's" words would be decisive in the commission. Eden finally asked the Political Committee to adopt the Indian proposal and take into account the wishes of the British delegation.

The speech by the representative of the Syngman Rhee clique took up a considerable amount of time at the meeting. He once again brazenly said that, as he understood it, the so-called "glorious and just peace in Korea" was the "complete victory" of the Syngman Rhee elements, that is, their occupation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. This representative of the Syngman Rhee clique also attacked the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea with stale slanderous remarks.

The last speaker at the meeting was Dutch Representative van Balluseck, who said that the American proposal and the proposals put forward by other countries that repeated the provisions in the American proposal were what could achieve a ceasefire in Korea. He emphasized that all other proposals except the Soviet proposal, including the Indian proposal, were based on the so-called "voluntary repatriation" principle, which is close to the American proposal. It is known that the American proposal is intended to justify the forced detention of prisoners of war in American prisoner-of-war camps.

### 联大法律、政治两委员会举行会议  维辛斯基就“侵略”定义发表演说  艾登再度无耻附和美国强迫扣留战俘原则

    联大法律、政治两委员会举行会议
    维辛斯基就“侵略”定义发表演说
    艾登再度无耻附和美国强迫扣留战俘原则
    【新华社二十三日讯】据塔斯社纽约讯：联合国大会第六（法律）委员会正在讨论“侵略”一词的定义问题。由于世界舆论越来越坚决地要求联合国制止侵略者，这个在目前国际形势中十分重要的问题吸引了许多国家代表团的极大注意。在委员会会议上，阿富汗、伊朗、印尼和埃及的代表们强调指出，必须给侵略下一个定义，以便谴责以各种形式表现出来的侵略政策。阿富汗代表说，弱小国家特别感觉到给侵略下一定义的必要，因为这些国家无时无刻不受公开和隐蔽的侵略之害。伊朗代表极力陈述给侵略下定义的必要性，他列举了许多事实，说明英国对伊朗的侵略政策。
    美国、英国以及追随美国的其他国家的代表就这个问题发言时提出种种无稽的藉口，企图阻挠联合国通过一项给侵略下一清楚明确定义的决议，因为这样一个决议就会使爱好和平的国家和人民获得一项对美英集团的侵略政策进行斗争的武器。
    美国代表格伦和英国代表费兹摩利斯反对给侵略下任何定义。他们荒唐地歪曲历史事实，企图证明给侵略下定义在理论上是不可能的，在实际上是不必要的。委内瑞拉代表说，目前的国际局势紧张，不宜于解决给侵略下定义的问题。然而人人都明白，正是因为北大西洋集团发动侵略战争的威胁，联合国才更有义务给侵略下一定义，并揭露各种外貌的侵略者。
    在委员会十一月二十一日的会议上，苏联外交部长维辛斯基发表演说，揭露了北大西洋侵略集团代表们为了反对给侵略下定义所列举的理由的荒谬，并具体说明了给侵略下一明确定义的必要性和可能性。
    维辛斯基在他的长篇演说中分析了过去几年来的国际局势。他在演说中指出，苏联向第六委员会提出的提案包括一个科学的侵略定义，这个定义回答了所有爱好和平的民族和国家的要求。
    【新华社二十三日讯】据塔斯社纽约讯：联合国大会政治委员会二十日继续讨论朝鲜问题。会议开始的时候，英国外交大臣艾登发表了简短演说。他避不谈到苏联提案，也不答复苏联代表团团长和白俄罗斯、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克和乌克兰代表最近的发言。
    艾登对于制造出来用以掩饰美军司令部拒绝遣返朝中战俘的所谓“自愿遣返”原则赞扬了一番，然后着重指出，他认为在承认这个“原则”上，印度提案和英国代表团的主张没有什么分歧。
    特别的是，一直到最近还佯称印度提案不合其意的美国代表团，也停止了对印度提案的攻击。在记者圈里流行这样的说法：美国政府已经决定对于这个提案采取赞成的态度。
    这是可以理解的：事实上，印度提案并不代表任何东西，它不过是稍加伪装的美国提案而已。的确，假如印度提案去掉其中的文字上的花样，那么它就会现出原形——它正是以同一违反一九四九年八月十二日的日内瓦公约的强迫甄别和扣留战俘的荒谬原则为基础的；为了外表好看，用了一些战俘
    “自愿选择”——回家去，或是永远留在远离家乡、远离亲属的外地——的伪善论据把这个原则掩盖起来。
    至于印度提案规定成立的遣返委员会，它的职务事实上归根结底不过是执行集中营管理当局的职务，战俘将在战争结束后在这种集中营里无限期地遭受苦难。
    不难看出，提出这个提案的国家想使这些战俘遭受战时流民的悲惨命运，这些战时流民在第二次世界大战后被西方国家先强迫扣留在集中营里，然后被交给美国、拉丁美洲、澳大利亚和其它国家的地主和资本家，供他们奴役。
    实际情形就是这样，艾登的发言表明了这一点。艾登表示希望印度提案规定成立某种委员会来安置战俘。艾登说：印度提案并没有规定在战争停止后遣返所有朝中战俘，他又说：必须由一个委员会来安置他们。
    艾登又说，印度提案应该具体说明遣返委员会推选的“仲裁人”必须是委员会的一个成员，而且必须是委员会的主席。这样，在委员会里，这个“仲裁人”的话就有决定性了。艾登最后要求政治委员会通过印度提案，并考虑到英国代表团的愿望。
    李承晚集团代表的发言占去了会议相当多的时间，他再一次厚颜无耻地说，据他了解，所谓“光荣的、公正的朝鲜和平”就是李承晚分子的“完全胜利”，就是他们占领朝鲜民主主义人民共和国。这个李承晚集团的代表还用陈腐的诽谤谰言来攻击苏联、中华人民共和国和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国。
    在会上最后发言的是荷兰代表巴鲁赛克，他说，根据美国的提案和其他国家所提出的重复美国提案中的规定的提案，是所谓能够达成朝鲜停战的。他着重指出，除了苏联提案以外，所有其它提案，包括印度提案在内，都是根据所谓“自愿遣返”原则提出的，是接近美国的提案的。大家知道，美国提案是要为强迫扣留美国俘虏营里的战俘辩解。
