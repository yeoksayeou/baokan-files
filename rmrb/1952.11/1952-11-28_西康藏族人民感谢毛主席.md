    Tibetan People of Xikang Thank Chairman Mao

    To the Editor: The entire comrades of the First Detachment of our Central Nationalities Health Work Brigade arrived in Batang County, Xikang Province, on June 10th. We overcame various difficulties to treat the Tibetan people. In three months, a total of 5,241 Tibetan people received treatment for initial diagnoses (approximately one-third of the county's population), and 17,820 patients received follow-up treatment (a total of 3,069 patients were cured). In August of this year, measles was discovered in the urban area of Batang County, affecting 606 patients (approximately two-thirds of the children in the urban area). After our active prevention and treatment, 433 people have been cured.

    We not only treated the Tibetan people's illnesses but also held training classes for health personnel, training new midwives, health workers, and laboratory technicians for the Tibetan people; and established a new-method delivery group, so that Tibetan women benefited from new-method deliveries.

    The Tibetan people sincerely thank Chairman Mao for his care. After we cured a disease of a sixty-year-old Tibetan woman, Ezhun, she said, "In the past, under the reactionary rule, I almost lost my life because I didn't have money for treatment. If it hadn't been for liberation and Chairman Mao sending good doctors to treat me, I was afraid I wouldn't have survived!" After the grandson of Tibetan elder A Yiquxi recovered from measles after treatment, A Yiquxi wrote a letter to Chairman Mao, expressing his heartfelt gratitude.

    When we were about to leave Batang and transfer to other areas, the Tibetan compatriots repeatedly asked us to stay.

    西康藏族人民感谢毛主席
    编辑同志：我们中央民族卫生工作大队第一中队的全体同志于六月十日到达西康省巴塘县。我们曾克服了种种困难，为藏民治疗疾病。三个月中受到治疗的藏族人民计初诊患者五千二百四十一人（约占全县人口的三分之一），复诊患者一万七千八百二十人（痊愈患者共有三千零六十九人）。本年八月间，巴塘县城区发现麻疹，患者达六百零六人（约占城区儿童的三分之二）。经过我们积极防治，已有四百三十三人痊愈。
    我们不仅给藏民治疗疾病，还举办了卫生人员训练班，给藏族人民培养新接生员、卫生员、化验员；并建立了一个新法接生小组，使藏族妇女受到了新法接生的好处。
    藏族人民衷心地感谢毛主席对他们的关怀。六十多岁的藏族老太太俄准在我们给她治好了病以后，说：“以前，在反动统治下，我因为没钱治，差点要了命；要不是解放了，毛主席派来好医生给我治病，怕活不成呢！”藏民老大爷阿一曲喜的孙子得了麻疹，经治好以后，阿一曲喜给毛主席写了一封信，表示衷心的感谢。
    当我们要离开巴塘向其他地区转移的时候，藏胞们一再地挽留我们。    杜建华    杜俊真
