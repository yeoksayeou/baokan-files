Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 21st: Our front-line correspondent reports on the heroic deeds of a team of Volunteer Army warriors who held their ground in tunnels for ten days and nights on Hill 597.9 on the Shangganling front, saying:

On the evening of October 14th, after inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy, the warriors organized themselves and moved into tunnel fortifications to continue fighting. As soon as they entered the tunnels, they organized crack "sniper teams" and "counter-attack teams."

Three enemies crept down from the hillside above the tunnel entrance. Just as the enemies were about to jump into the entrance, the warrior Zhou Haiquan suddenly threw a hand grenade, knocking down two enemies and scaring away the other. A moment later, seven or eight enemies rushed over from the top of the cave and both sides of the entrance, throwing a bag of explosives into the tunnel entrance. The explosives hissed and smoked, and then exploded with a bang, filling the entrance with smoke and dust. The enemy was about to take the opportunity to rush into the tunnel, but two more hand grenades flew out of the cave, and the enemy dared not approach the entrance again, only daring to throw explosive packs and shoot from the top of the cave.

The warriors were not only able to thwart enemy attacks on the tunnels, but also launch attacks outside the tunnels. At dawn on the 18th, a 12-man assault team went out from another hidden tunnel entrance. They separately pounced on two small bunkers that the enemy had temporarily built, threw a row of hand grenades, and then quickly returned to the tunnel. This attack took only nine minutes and annihilated twenty or thirty enemies. The enemy became anxious and threw explosive packs at the entrance all day long. Later, they threw a large bundle of barbed wire with barbs from the top of the cave, trying to block the tunnel entrance. But the barbed wire was immediately blown away by the warriors with demolition tubes. At three o'clock this late night, when the frost was heavy, the warriors in the tunnel launched a second attack. Although the enemy's flares appeared constantly in the air, two warriors on the attack still passed through the enemy's heavy guard and crawled to the enemy's fortifications. At this time, the enemy was sound asleep. The two warriors threw grenades into the fortifications, and after a burst of explosions, dozens of enemies were killed.

On October 24th, our army launched a powerful counter-attack. The warriors who had persisted in fighting in the tunnels for ten days and nights cooperated with the counter-attacking troops to recover all the ground positions on the mountain that had been occupied by the enemy.

    志愿军战士在上甘岭前线
    英勇进行坑道战
    【新华社朝鲜前线二十一日电】本社前线通讯员报道上甘岭前线五九七点九高地上一队志愿军勇士坚守坑道十昼夜的英勇事迹说：
    十月十四日晚上，勇士们杀伤大量敌人以后，便有组织地转入坑道工事继续战斗。他们一进坑道，就组织了精干的“狙击组”和“反击组”。
    三个敌人从坑道口上面的山坡上摸下来了，正当敌人想跳进洞口的时候，战士周海泉突然投出一个手榴弹。把敌人炸倒了两个，另一个吓跑了。一会儿，七、八个敌人从洞顶上和洞口的两边扑了过来，把一包炸药扔进了坑道口。炸药“嗤”“嗤”的冒了烟，轰地一声炸了，洞口里弥漫着浓烟和飞腾的尘土。敌人正想在这时乘机冲进坑道，但是洞里又飞出两个手榴弹，敌人就再也不敢接近洞口了，只敢从洞顶往下扔炸药包和打枪。
    勇士们不光能粉碎敌人对坑道的袭击；而且还向坑道外面出击。十八日拂晓，一支十二个人组成的出击队从另外一个隐蔽的坑道口出去了，他们分头扑向敌人两个临时修成的小地堡，投出一排手榴弹然后马上迅速地回到坑道里。这次出击，只有九分钟就歼灭了二、三十个敌人。敌人急了，便向洞口投了整整一天的炸药包，以后又从洞顶投下一大捆带倒刺的铁丝网，企图把坑道口堵住。可是铁丝网随即被勇士们用爆破筒炸飞了。这天深夜三点钟，寒霜正浓的时候，坑道里的勇士们又作了第二次出击。虽然敌人的照明弹在空中不断地出现，但是两位出击的勇士仍然通过了敌人的重重警戒，爬到敌人的工事旁边。这时敌人正在酣睡，两位勇士将手雷投进工事，一阵爆炸，几十个敌人都被炸死了。
    十月二十四日，我军发起了强大的反击战。在坑道里坚持作战十昼夜的勇士们，配合反击部队收复了山头上全部被敌人占领的地面阵地。
