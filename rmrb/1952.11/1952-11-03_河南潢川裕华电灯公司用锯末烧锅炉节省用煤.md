    Yuhua Electric Light Company in Huangchuan, Henan Province, saves coal by burning sawdust in boilers
    Comrade Editor: In the production increase and economy movement, the staff and workers of the state-owned Yuhua Electric Light Company in Huangchuan, Henan Province, have worked hard to study their business and found a trick to save coal by mixing sawdust and coal to burn in boilers.
    This company is attached to a sawmill. It can produce more than 1,000 catties of sawdust every day. This sawdust is not worth much to sell, and few people buy it. If it rains, it will rot. Therefore, under the leadership of the Party, the staff and workers actively tried to use it to burn boilers. First, the masters and apprentices in the boiler room started to try burning it. After more than ten days of repeated experiments, they finally succeeded. The operation method is: first burn a layer of coal as a base fire, and then burn sawdust and coal alternately, that is, burn sawdust for one hour, and then burn coal for five minutes (still as a base fire). The ratio of sawdust to coal is at most nine catties of sawdust to one catty of coal. Every two catties of sawdust can replace one catty of coal, and the flame is higher than coal, and the steam rises faster.
    After Yuhua Electric Light Company burned sawdust, it can save 170,000 yuan every day, and more than 60 million yuan throughout the year.

    河南潢川裕华电灯公司用锯末烧锅炉节省用煤
    编辑同志：河南潢川国营裕华电灯公司职工，在增产节约运动中努力钻研业务，找出了用锯末和煤掺烧锅炉的节约窍门。
    这个公司附设有锯木厂。每天能出锯末一千多斤。这些锯末卖也不值钱，同时也很少有人买，若遇阴雨天就要霉烂。因此在党的领导下，职工们就积极想办法用它烧锅炉。首先由锅炉房的师徒们开始试烧。经十多天的反复试验，终于成功了。操作方法是：先烧一层煤作底火，然后用锯末和煤轮流烧，即每烧一小时锯末，再烧煤五分钟（仍作底火）。锯末和煤用量的比例最高是烧九斤锯末，烧一斤煤。每两斤锯末可以顶一斤煤，并且比煤的火焰高，上汽还快。
    裕华电灯公司烧用锯末后，每天可节约十七万元，全年可节约六千多万元。
