Xinhua News Agency, 28th: The American aggressors have suffered heavy casualties in their war of aggression against Korea, exposing their weakness of insufficient troop strength even more. In order to continue and even expand the war, the commander of the U.S. forces in Korea, Clark, has announced the extension of the rotation period for U.S. troops. This measure has aroused great dissatisfaction among the U.S. soldiers who are longing to return home day and night. United Press reporter Panton reported from Korea on the 24th about this resentment revealed by lower-ranking U.S. officers and soldiers in their conversations with him. This United Press dispatch said:

    "A group of American soldiers today vehemently criticized the Army's rotation system. Their words were so激愤(ji fen--agitated, indignant) that some of them were unwilling to have their names mentioned in the news. The news that the Army authorities were increasing the points necessary for rotation out of Korea had just reached their ears. They said: Thirty-six points are not enough; now soldiers here need thirty-eight points.

    "A forty-year-old sergeant said: 'Okay, I can tell you what I think, but don't write down my name. I still have to stay here for a while, and I don't want to get into trouble. A person can endure staying here as long as there is a definite date to get out. But if the rotation period keeps getting extended like this, you can no longer trust the Army authorities.'"

    "A bespectacled corporal working in the division headquarters was extremely angry and didn't care whether his name was published or not.

    "Corporal Seton from Arkansas said: 'The Army authorities are always uncertain about what they want to do. Soldiers have lost faith in the Army authorities' promises.'

    "A person next to him sneered: 'Now you should know, never, ever trust the Army authorities.'"

    侵朝美军士兵怨恨延长轮换期
    【新华社二十八日讯】美国侵略者在侵略朝鲜的战争中遭受了惨重的伤亡，兵力不足的弱点更加暴露。为了继续以至扩大战争，侵朝美军总司令克拉克已经宣布要延长美军的轮换期。这一措施引起了日夜渴望回国的美军士兵的极大不满。美国的合众社记者潘登二十四日从朝鲜报道了美军下层官兵在和他谈话中透露出来的这种怨恨情绪。合众社这篇电讯说：
    “一群美国兵士今天对陆军当局的轮换制度痛加抨击。他们的话是这样激愤，以至于其中有些人不肯让这个消息举出他们的名字。陆军当局增加轮换调离朝鲜所必需的点数的消息，刚刚传到这些人耳朵里。他们说：三十六点不够了，现在这里的兵士要有三十八点才行。
    “一个四十岁的中士说：‘好的，我可以告诉你我的看法，但是不要写出我的名字，我还得在这儿呆一个时期，我不愿惹麻烦。一个人留在这里只要有一个确定的日子可以脱身，他还可以受得了。但是，像这样轮换期限老是延长下去，你就再也不能相信陆军当局了。”
    “一个在师部工作的戴眼镜的下士气愤极了，他倒不在乎是否把他的名字发表。
    “阿肯色州的塞顿下士说：‘陆军当局对于它自己到底要怎么办，老是不能肯定，兵士对于陆军当局的诺言已失去了信心。’
    “旁边的一个人冷笑道：‘现在你们该知道了，永远、永远不要信任陆军当局。’”
