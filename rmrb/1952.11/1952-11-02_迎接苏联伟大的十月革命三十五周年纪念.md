    Commemorating the 35th Anniversary of the Great October Revolution in the Soviet Union
    Chen Shutong, Vice Chairman of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace
    November 7th marks the 35th anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution in the Soviet Union. To celebrate this great festival and further develop and consolidate the unbreakable friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union, all of us in China have decided to hold a "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month" throughout the country. Our people will participate extensively in various activities of the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month" with the highest enthusiasm.
    The victory of the October Revolution in the Soviet Union ushered in a new era in human history. It signifies the fundamental transformation of human history from the old capitalist world to the new socialist world. The October Revolution inaugurated the era of proletarian revolution in imperialist countries and the era of revolution for all oppressed classes and oppressed nations around the world. It pointed out a path to a bright future for all progressive humanity. We, the Chinese people, are able to deeply understand this great historical significance of the October Revolution. Chairman Mao said, "The salvoes of the October Revolution brought us Marxism-Leninism." Two years after the October Revolution, in 1919, the anti-imperialist and anti-feudal "May Fourth" patriotic movement occurred in China. Four years after the October Revolution, in 1921, the Communist Party of China was established. Six years after the October Revolution, in 1923, Mr. Sun Yat-sen resolved to "take Russia as his teacher," unite with the Communist Party, and re-launch the revolution. These developments all took place under the call and influence of the October Revolution. Moreover, in our revolutionary struggles, whenever we encountered difficulties or suffered setbacks, our confidence in victory never wavered. This is because we saw the victory of the October Revolution in the Soviet Union and the strong existence of the Soviet Union today. We had reason to believe that our revolution would surely be victorious. History has proven that this confidence of the Chinese people was correct. Inspired by the great October Revolution, the Chinese people overthrew the layers of oppression by imperialism and feudalism and finally achieved final victory, establishing their own people's country. As we drink water, we must remember the source; we cannot but thank the October Revolution, and we cannot but thank Lenin, Stalin, and the Soviet people.
    The great revolution of the Chinese people was carried out under the influence of the October Revolution, and at the same time, it achieved great victory with the help of the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union immediately announced the abolition of unequal treaties imposed on China by Tsarist Russia after the October Revolution. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Soviet Union was the first to aid China's resistance, providing us with huge military material assistance. Many heroic Soviet airmen directly participated in our War of Resistance Against Japan. Finally, in August 1945, the Soviet Union directly sent troops to annihilate the Japanese Kwantung Army, helping our people to achieve victory in the War of Resistance Against Japan. On October 1, 1949, the People's Republic of China was proclaimed, and the Soviet Union was the first country in the world to announce the establishment of diplomatic relations with our country. Subsequently, the seven hundred million people of China and the Soviet Union formed an unbreakable and powerful alliance, and concluded the "Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance," guaranteeing peace in the Far East and the world. At the same time, China and the Soviet Union have successively signed various agreements that are beneficial to our construction endeavors and to the common interests of the two peoples. Internationally, the Soviet Union has consistently given us significant support, opposing the American aggression against Korea and the occupation of our territory Taiwan, and opposing the absurd actions of the United States in unreasonably preventing our country from attending various United Nations meetings. In the economic field, the enormous assistance given to our country by the Soviet government and people was an important condition for the smooth progress and rapid completion of our three-year economic recovery work. Our industrial and agricultural production has reached or exceeded the pre-War of Resistance Against Japan level; many factories and mines have been restored and newly built; flood diversion projects have been carried out on the Huai River and Jing River, as well as other water conservancy projects; and many railways have been restored and newly built. In all these great and arduous tasks, Soviet experts have provided extremely important and valuable contributions. Now that our country is about to enter a large-scale economic and cultural construction phase, we have been assured that we will continue to receive more and greater assistance from the Soviet Union. Facts have proven that only with the assistance of the Soviet Union can China's construction undertakings be carried out so rapidly and smoothly.
    Today, the Far East and the world are facing an increasingly serious threat of war. American imperialism not only continues to delay and sabotage the Korean armistice negotiations, plotting to expand the war of aggression against Korea, but also continues to occupy our territory Taiwan. At the same time, it has concluded a separate peace treaty with Japan, reviving Japanese militarism and rearming Japan. Its purpose is clearly to create a military threat to our country and the Soviet Union, and to prepare for a new and larger-scale war of aggression in the Far East. This action by American imperialism seriously undermines the peace and security of the entire Asian region. The people of Asia and the Pacific region, who suffered from Japanese aggression and occupation during World War II, cannot but feel deeply resentful of the war policy of American imperialism. Therefore, they all have deep sympathy for the just and sacred war of the Korean and Chinese people against American imperialist aggression, and provide moral and material support. At the same time, they have a more intimate understanding that the friendly alliance between China and the Soviet Union is indeed a strong guarantee for peace and security in the Far East, and a force they can fully trust and rely on, because the strength of the Sino-Soviet friendly alliance is invincible in the world. China and the Soviet Union are the two largest countries in the world. Together, China and the Soviet Union have one-third of the world's population, one-fourth of the world's total land area, and the most powerful armed forces in the world. Most importantly, our two countries, China and the Soviet Union, are the most advanced countries politically and are closely united with the peace-loving people of the world. Such a powerful Sino-Soviet friendly alliance must be a strong fortress for peace in the Far East and the world. In the past two years, the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance has played an extremely important role in preventing the threat of aggression and safeguarding peace in the Far East and the world, and will undoubtedly play a more important role in the future. The Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance not only conforms to the interests of the people of China and the Soviet Union, but also conforms to the interests of the broad masses of people in Asia and the Pacific region and the world. Due to the existence of the powerful Sino-Soviet friendly alliance, the era of imperialism's dominance in Asia has come to an end forever.
    Chairman Mao said that we, the Chinese people, must take the road of the Russians. The great achievements of the Soviet Union in socialist and communist construction over the past thirty-five years are the beautiful vision of our construction. After the October Revolution, the Soviet Union victoriously built a socialist society, eliminated the system of human exploitation, and further realized the industrialization of the country and the collectivization of agriculture. After several great five-year plans, the Soviet Union was built into an extremely prosperous socialist country. After achieving a great victory in the Patriotic War, the Soviet Union immediately carried out peaceful construction. After the Fourth Five-Year Plan, it began a great communist construction project that is unprecedented in human history. Recently, the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union passed the instructions on the Fifth Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy. By 1955, the industrial output of the Soviet Union will be three times that of 1940. Malenkov pointed out that the Fifth Five-Year Plan means that the Soviet Union has taken another big step on the road from socialism to communism. The road of the Soviet Union to build socialism and communism is exactly the road we want to take. The future of our new China is such a perfect and happy communist society. Therefore, we should learn from the Soviet Union, learn from the Soviet Union's revolutionary experience, learn from the Soviet Union's experience in planned economy, learn from the Soviet Union's experience in industrial and agricultural construction, and learn from the Soviet Union's experience in national defense construction and cultural and educational construction. We must learn all the advanced experiences of the Soviet Union to build our motherland and make it increasingly happy, prosperous, and strong. The history of the Chinese people's struggle over the past thirty years has clearly proven that learning from the Soviet Union will enable us to move forward victoriously and will enable us to move from victory to victory.
    Chairman Mao said in the opening speech of the Third Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference: "Ideological remolding, especially the ideological remolding of intellectuals of all kinds, is one of the important conditions for our country to thoroughly realize democratic reforms in various aspects and gradually implement industrialization." Under the call of Chairman Mao, all sectors and strata of our country, especially intellectuals of all kinds, have launched a movement of self-education and self-remolding, and have achieved initial victories. The experience of the Soviet Union in the ideological remolding movement during the nation-building process and in the struggle against the remnants of non-proletarian thought is also our best reference. In the Soviet Union's thirty years of construction, the old ideology and consciousness of the people have been constantly transformed with the weapon of criticism and self-criticism. In the years after the victory of the Patriotic War, a fierce struggle was waged to eliminate the remnants of bourgeois ideology, especially bourgeois cosmopolitanism. At the same time, a movement to study Marxism-Leninism was launched to enable the people of the whole country to better grasp the laws of social development and the laws of building a communist society, so as to promote the great construction cause of their country. Marshal Stalin's recent great work on socialist economic problems – "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR" – made a brilliant summary of these laws, pointed out the prospects for the realization of socialism and communism throughout the world according to irresistible principles, and gave us the latest ideological armament, which we should study well.
    The brilliant achievements of the Soviet Union in national construction over the past thirty years have unfolded a boundless and beautiful vision for us, the Chinese people who are carrying out the new democratic construction, giving us great encouragement and inspiration. We, the Chinese people, must always learn from the Soviet people. "Taking the road of the Russians - this is the conclusion."

    迎接苏联伟大的十月革命三十五周年纪念
    中国人民保卫世界和平委员会副主席    陈叔通
    十一月七日是苏联伟大的十月社会主义革命三十五周年纪念日。我们全中国人民，为了庆祝这个伟大的节日，并进一步发展与巩固中苏两国人民之间的牢不可破的友谊，决定在全国举行“中苏友好月”。我国人民都将以最高涨的热情来广泛地参加“中苏友好月”的各种活动。
    苏联十月革命的胜利，开创了人类历史的新纪元。它意味着人类历史由旧的资本主义世界到新的社会主义世界的根本转变。十月革命揭开了帝国主义国家无产阶级革命的时代，揭开了全世界一切被压迫阶级和被压迫民族革命的时代。它为全体进步人类指出了一条走向光明的道路。十月革命的这种伟大历史意义，我们中国人民是能够深刻理解的。毛主席说过：“十月革命一声炮响，给我们送来了马克思列宁主义。”十月革命后两年，即一九一九年，中国发生了反帝反封建的“五四”爱国运动。十月革命后四年，即一九二一年，中国共产党成立。十月革命后六年，即一九二三年，孙中山先生决心“以俄为师”，联合共产党，重新发动革命。这些演变，无一不是在十月革命的号召和影响下发生的。而我们中国人民在革命斗争中，每当遇到困难、受到失败的时候，我们的胜利信心从来就没有动摇，这是因为我们看到了苏联十月革命的胜利，看到了今日苏联的强大存在，我们就有理由相信我们的革命一定会胜利的。历史证明：中国人民的这种信心是正确的。中国人民在伟大的十月革命启示之下，推翻了帝国主义封建主义的层层压迫，终于取得了最后胜利，建立了人民自己的国家。饮水思源，我们不能不感谢十月革命，不能不感谢列宁、斯大林和苏联人民。
    中国人民伟大的革命，是在十月革命影响下进行的，同时，又是在苏联的帮助下取得了伟大胜利的。苏联于十月革命后立即宣布废除帝俄对中国的不平等条约。在抗日战争时期，苏联首先援助中国抗战，给我们以巨大的军事物资援助，许多英勇的苏联航空员并直接参加了我们的抗日战争。最后于一九四五年八月，苏联直接出兵歼灭了日本关东军，帮助了我国人民取得抗日战争的胜利。一九四九年十月一日中华人民共和国宣告成立，苏联是国际上第一个宣布与我国建立外交关系的国家。接着，中苏两国七亿人民结成了牢不可破的强大同盟，缔结了“中苏友好同盟互助条约”，保障了远东与世界和平。同时中苏两国还先后签订了有利于我国建设事业、有利于两国人民共同利益的各项协定。在国际上，苏联一直给予我们以重大的支持，反对美国侵略朝鲜和侵占我国领土台湾，反对美国无理阻挠我国出席联合国各种会议的荒谬行动。在经济方面，苏联政府和人民给予我国的巨大援助，是我国三年经济恢复工作得以顺利进行和迅速完成的一个重要条件。我们在工农业生产方面已达到或超过了抗日战争前的水平；恢复和新建了许多工厂矿山；进行了淮河、荆江分洪以及其他的水利工程建设；恢复和新修了许多铁道。在所有这些伟大艰难的工作上，苏联专家们都提供了极其重要的和有巨大价值的贡献。现在我国即将进入大规模的经济建设和文化建设，我们已得到保证将继续从苏联得到更多和更大的帮助。事实已经证明，只是在苏联的援助下，中国的建设事业才能这样迅速地顺利地开展。
    今天的远东和世界正面临着日益严重的战争威胁。美国帝国主义不但继续拖延和破坏朝鲜停战谈判，阴谋扩大侵朝战争，并且仍然侵占着我国领土台湾；同时还与日本缔结了片面和约，复活日本军国主义，重新武装日本，其目的显然在造成对于我国和苏联的军事威胁，准备新的更大规模的远东侵略战争。美帝国主义的这种行动，严重地破坏了整个亚洲的和平与安全。曾经在第二次大战期间身受过日本侵略和占领之苦的亚洲和太平洋区域的人民，对于美国帝国主义的战争政策不能不深感愤恨。因此他们对于朝中人民反对美帝国主义侵略的正义神圣的战争莫不寄予深厚的同情并给予道义的和物资的支持。同时，他们更亲切地认识到了，中苏两国的友好同盟，实在是远东和平与安全的坚强保障，是他们可以完全信赖、完全依靠的一支力量，因为中苏友好同盟的力量是世界无敌的。中苏两国是世界上最大的两个国家。中苏两国合起来，有着占全世界人口三分之一的人民，占全世界陆地总面积的四分之一的土地，有着世界上最强大的武装力量。而最重要的，是我们中苏两国在政治上都是最先进的国家，并且紧密地团结了全世界爱好和平的人民。像这样强大的中苏友好同盟，必然是远东与世界和平的强大堡垒。在过去两年中中苏友好同盟互助条约对于制止侵略威胁、保卫远东与世界和平上已经起了极其重大的作用，今后无疑还会起着更重大的作用。中苏友好同盟互助条约不仅是符合于中苏两国人民的利益，而且也是符合于亚洲及太平洋区域以及全世界广大人民群众的利益的。由于强大的中苏友好同盟的存在，帝国主义在亚洲横行霸道的时代已经永远宣告结束了。
    毛主席说过，我们中国人民要走俄国人的路。三十五年来苏联社会主义和共产主义建设的伟大成就，就是我们建设的美丽远景。苏联在十月革命后，胜利地建成了社会主义社会，消灭了人剥削人的制度，进一步实现国家工业化与农业集体化，经过了几次伟大的五年计划，把苏联建设成为极其富强的社会主义国家。在卫国战争中取得了伟大的胜利后，苏联立即进行和平建设，经过第四个五年计划，已开始了伟大的、在人类历史上空前未有的共产主义建设工程。最近苏联共产党第十九次代表大会通过了关于发展国民经济的第五个五年计划的指示。到一九五五年，苏联的工业生产量将为一九四○年的三倍。马林科夫指出：第五个五年计划意味着苏联在从社会主义走向共产主义的道路上又迈进了一大步。苏联建设社会主义和共产主义的道路正是我们要走的道路。我们新中国的前途也就是这样美满和幸福的共产主义社会。所以我们应该向苏联好好学习，学习苏联革命的经验，学习苏联进行计划经济的经验，学习苏联的工农业建设经验，学习苏联的国防建设及文化教育建设的经验。我们要学习苏联的一切先进经验来建设我们的祖国，使她日益幸福富强起来。过去三十多年中国人民的斗争历史已清楚地证明，学习苏联，就能使我们不断胜利地前进，就能使我们从胜利走向胜利。
    毛主席在中国人民政治协商会议第一届全国委员会第三次会议开会词中说：“思想改造，首先是各种知识分子的思想改造，是我国在各方面彻底实现民主改革和逐步实行工业化的重要条件之一。”在毛主席的号召下，我国全国各界各阶层，特别是各种知识分子，已经展开了一个自我教育和自我改造的运动，并已得到了初步的胜利。苏联在建国过程中的思想改造运动和与非无产阶级思想残余进行斗争的经验，也是我们最好的借鉴。在苏联三十多年建设的过程中，不断地用批评与自我批评的武器改造了人民的旧思想意识。卫国战争胜利后的这几年中，对于肃清资产阶级思想残余特别是资产阶级的世界主义思想作了激烈斗争；同时展开了学习马克思列宁主义的运动，使全国人民更好地掌握社会发展的规律和建设共产主义社会的规律，以推进自己国家的伟大建设事业。斯大林大元帅最近关于社会主义经济问题的伟大著作——“苏联社会主义经济问题”——把这些规律作了天才的总结，指出了社会主义和共产主义将根据不可违抗的原则而在全世界实现的远景，给了我们以最新锐的思想武装，是我们所应当好好学习的。
    苏联三十多年来国家建设所获得的辉煌成就，给我们正在进行新民主主义建设的中国人民，展开了一幅无限美好的远景，给我们以极大的鼓舞与启示。我们中国人民一定要永远向苏联人民学习。“走俄国人的路——这就是结论”。
