    Tangshan Steel Plant's "Flame Spray Surface Quenching Method" Successfully Tested

    To the Editor: The Tangshan Steel Plant's Mechanical and Electrical Workshop, learning from advanced Soviet experiences, has successfully tested the "flame spray surface quenching method."

    Last year, this workshop tentatively experimented with the "flame spray surface quenching method" once, but due to a lack of theoretical guidance and advanced tools, it was unsuccessful. In August of this year, the Iron and Steel Industry Bureau notified various factories and mines to go to the Taiyuan Machine Factory to learn about the "flame spray surface quenching method" taught by Soviet experts. The Tangshan Steel Plant sent mechanical technician Zhu Haiquan and technician Dong Huange to study. After they returned to the factory, they actively sought solutions with the workers of various sections of the Mechanical and Electrical Department, equipped tools, and prepared to promote the method. Soon after, Soviet expert Comrade Yelosky also rushed from Taiyuan to the Tangshan Steel Plant to help the plant install the machinery and conduct the experiment, which finally succeeded.

    The advantages of the "flame spray surface quenching method" are: 1. Quick operation; 2. Simple equipment, capable of quenching various shapes of steel parts; 3. Safe operation, easy to teach; 4. The wear resistance of steel parts is increased three to four times compared to unquenched parts.

    During the experiment of the "flame spray surface quenching method," Soviet expert Comrade Yelosky patiently explained the theory of quenching and guided the practical operation. Therefore, everyone is very grateful to the Soviet expert.

    唐山钢厂“喷焰表面淬火法”试验成功
    编辑同志：唐山钢厂机电车间学习苏联先进经验，试验“喷焰表面淬火法”成功。
    去年这个车间曾摸索着试验过一次“喷焰表面淬火法”，但由于缺乏理论指导，和缺少先进工具，没有成功。今年八月钢铁工业局通知各厂矿去太原机器厂学习苏联专家讲授的“喷焰表面淬火法”。唐山钢厂便派了机械技师朱海泉和技工董焕阁去学习。他们回厂之后，和机电部各工段的职工积极想办法，配备工具，准备推行。不久，苏联专家叶洛斯基同志也由太原赶到唐山钢厂，帮助该厂按装机器和试验，终于试验成功。
    “喷焰表面淬火法”的优点是：一、操作迅速；二、设备简单，能淬火各种不同形态的钢件；三、操作安全，便于传授；四、钢件耐磨时间比未经淬火的增加三倍到四倍。
    这个车间在试验“喷焰表面淬火法”时，苏联专家叶洛斯基同志耐心地讲授了淬火的理论，指导了实际操作，因此大家十分感谢苏联专家。
