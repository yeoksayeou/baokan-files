    The Special Political Committee of the Seventh Session of the United Nations General Assembly passed two resolutions on November 11th and 20th respectively regarding the "Treatment of People of Indian Origin in South Africa" and the "Issue of Racial Conflict in South Africa," condemning the South African Malan reactionary government for implementing racist policies. The United Nations also established two committees to mediate and study these two issues, respectively, to report to the Eighth Session of the United Nations General Assembly. During the discussions, the South African representative, under the instigation of the US, British, and French imperialist blocs, attempted to obstruct the passage of these resolutions under the pretext of "non-interference in internal affairs." However, due to the firm demands of Asian, Arab, and some Latin American countries, and the just support of the Soviet Union and representatives of various people's democratic countries, both resolutions were passed by a majority. This was a major defeat for the US, British, and French imperialist blocs in the United Nations General Assembly.
    During the discussion of the issue of opposing racial discrimination in South Africa, Britain and France openly stood with the reactionary South African government, hindering the meeting from discussing this issue. The United States repeatedly obstructed the inclusion of this issue on the agenda and proposed so-called "amendments" in an attempt to weaken the power of the resolutions. However, these conspiratorial tricks of the US, British, and French imperialist blocs all suffered shameful failures. The meeting did not develop in the direction they had planned. This fact once again proves to the people of the world that the imperialist bloc headed by the United States is the enemy of all oppressed nations in the world. They are constantly trying to incite ethnic hatred among the people of various countries to facilitate their rule and enslavement of weak countries.
    The South African government has always pursued a policy of racial oppression. After the Malan reactionary government came to power, with the encouragement of the US and British imperialist blocs, it intensified its anti-democratic and anti-freedom racial discrimination and national oppression policies. On March 2, 1949, the Malan government openly declared: "Non-European people in South Africa will never obtain the same political rights as Europeans. There will never be social equality in South Africa. Europeans will always be the masters of South Africa." Currently, the degree of barbarity and brutality of the racial discrimination policies implemented by the Malan reactionary government is appalling. The Malan reactionary government has created a series of racial discrimination laws, among which the so-called "Group Areas Act," passed in June 1950 and implemented in March 1951, is the most barbaric and brutal. According to this reactionary law, non-Europeans, who account for four-fifths of the South African Federation's population, or about ten million people, including Africans, Indians, and other Asians, including 6,000 overseas Chinese, will be deported to sparsely populated and barren "specific areas," restricting their freedom of movement and even depriving them of their basic right to survival. But the Malan government's reactionary measures do not stop there. In July 1950, it also published the "Suppression of Communism Act." Under the smokescreen of this bill, thousands of people who advocate national equality and oppose racial slavery have been imprisoned or subjected to other illegal persecution. The South African reactionary rulers treat non-European people in South Africa entirely with the ruling methods of medieval slave owners towards slaves and Hitler towards the Jewish people, deliberately creating ethnic hatred in an attempt to make non-European people in South Africa their slaves forever. But these reactionary policies and measures have not stopped the South African people's demands for democracy and equality. The South African people have not succumbed to this. On the contrary, under brutal suppression, the South African people are now launching an unprecedented high tide of resistance movement, launching a large-scale struggle against the Malan government's racial oppression policies.
    The Chinese people, who have long suffered from national oppression by foreign imperialism and have now achieved national independence, deeply sympathize with the South African people's struggle against the racial oppression of the reactionary South African government and their demand for racial equality. The Chinese people fully understand the suffering of the non-European people in South Africa and support their just struggle. In July and September 1950, Chairman Mao Zedong twice replied to the "Indian Congress" in Transvaal and Durban, South African Federation, expressing support for their reasonable protests against the South African Federation government's so-called "Group Areas Act" which discriminates against Chinese, Indian and other Asian people. In his reply to the 20th annual meeting of the "Indian Congress" in South Africa on January 19 this year, Premier Zhou Enlai wished the conference success in the cause of national liberation against persecution and tyranny. Throughout the world, all peace-loving people are increasingly widely supporting the South African people's just struggle. The resolution on the issue of colonial national independence adopted at the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference held in Beijing, the capital of our country, in October this year, called on the people of all countries to "oppose all activities that promote racial discrimination and sow discord among nations, as well as all malicious propaganda that incites war." This represents the firm will of 1.6 billion people in the Asian and Pacific regions.
    The Chinese people firmly believe that no matter how the colonial countries continue to carry out their policies of oppression, the just struggle of the heroic South African people will surely be victorious.

### 制止南非反动政府的种族歧视政策

    制止南非反动政府的种族歧视政策
    联合国第七届大会特别政治委员会，曾于十一月十一日及二十日，先后通过关于“南非境内印度籍血统居民待遇问题”和“南非种族冲突问题”两项决议，谴责南非马兰反动政府实行种族歧视政策。联合国并成立两个委员会，分别从事斡旋与研究该两项问题，以便向第八届联合国大会提出报告。在讨论过程中，南非代表在美、英、法帝国主义集团指使下，企图以“内政问题不能干涉”为藉口，阻挠这些决议的通过；但是，在亚洲、阿剌伯国家及一部分拉丁美洲国家的坚决要求，以及苏联和各人民民主国家代表的正义支持之下，两项决议都获得多数通过。这是美、英帝国主义集团在联合国大会上的一次重大的失败。
    在反对南非种族歧视问题讨论的过程中，英、法公然与南非反动政府站在一起，阻挠会议对这个问题进行讨论；美国一再阻挠将这个问题列入议程，并提出所谓“修正”案，以图削弱决议的力量。但是，美、英、法帝国主义集团的这些阴谋花样，都遭到了可耻的失败。会议并没有按照他们所预谋的方向发展。这一事实，再一次在全世界人民面前证明：以美国为首的帝国主义集团，是全世界一切被压迫民族的敌人。他们无时无刻不想在各国人民中间挑动民族仇恨，以便利他们对各弱小国家的统治和奴役。
    南非政府素来就是奉行种族压迫政策的。马兰反动政府上台后，在美、英帝国主义集团的鼓励下，更变本加厉地实行其反民主自由的种族歧视及民族压迫政策。一九四九年三月二日马兰政府就曾公开宣布：“非欧洲人民在南非永远不能获得和欧洲人同等的政治权利。南非永远也不会有社会地位平等的事情。欧洲人永远是南非洲的主人。”目前，马兰反动政府所执行的种族歧视政策，其野蛮残暴的程度是惊人的。马兰反动政府制造了一连串的种族歧视的法律，其中，一九五零年六月通过而于一九五一年三月实行的所谓“种族隔离法”，就是最野蛮残暴的一种。根据这一反动法律，占南非联邦五分之四约一千万人口的非欧洲籍人，包括非洲人、印度人以及其他亚洲人，其中并有华侨六千人，都要被驱逐到人烟稀少、土地贫瘠的“特定地区”，并限制他们的行动自由，甚至剥夺他们基本的生存权利。但是马兰政府的反动措施并不止此，在一九五零年七月又发表了“镇压共产主义法”。在这法案的烟幕下，成千的主张民族平等反对种族奴役的人们，遭到监禁或受到其他非法迫害。南非反动统治者完全以中世纪奴隶主对奴隶、希特勒对犹太民族的统治手段对待南非的非欧洲籍人民，蓄意制造民族仇恨，企图使南非的非欧洲籍人民永远成为它的奴隶。但是这些反动的政策与措施，并没有阻挡得了南非人民对民主、平等的要求。南非人民并未因此屈服，相反地，在残酷镇压下的南非人民，目前正掀起了前所未有的反抗运动的高潮，展开了大规模反对马兰政府种族压迫政策的斗争。
    曾长期遭受过外国帝国主义的民族压迫、现在已经获得民族独立的中国人民，对南非人民反对南非反动政府的种族压迫、要求种族平等的斗争，是深表同情的。中国人民对南非的非欧洲籍人民所受的苦难，是完全理解的，并支持他们这种正义的斗争。一九五零年七月和九月间，毛泽东主席曾两次复电南非联邦达兰士瓦州和杜邦“印度人大会”，表示支持他们对南非联邦政府歧视中、印及其他亚洲人民的所谓“种族隔离法”的合理抗议。周恩来总理今年一月十九日在致南非“印度人大会”第二十届年会的复电中，预祝大会对反迫害与反暴政的民族解放事业有所贡献。在世界各地，一切爱好和平的人民，对南非人民的这一正义斗争，正日益广泛地予以声援与支持。今年十月在我国首都北京召开的亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议所通过的对殖民地民族独立问题的决议，便曾号召各国人民“反对一切鼓吹种族歧视和在各民族间挑拨离间的活动，以及一切煽动战争的恶意宣传。”这是代表着亚洲及太平洋区域十六亿人民的坚强意志的。
    中国人民深信，不论殖民国家如何继续进行压迫政策，英勇的南非人民的正义斗争，必然是会得到胜利的。
