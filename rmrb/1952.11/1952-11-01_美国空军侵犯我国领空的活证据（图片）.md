Eight US F-84 fighter planes intruded into the airspace over Ji'an County, Liaodong Province at 5:42 AM on October 26th. At 5:47 AM, they intruded into the airspace over Shihu, diving and strafing, and dropping seven bombs, killing two civilians and injuring seventeen. As the enemy planes wreaked havoc, one was shot down by the fierce fire of our ground air defense forces. The pilot, Lael Cameron, was captured alive by our army after parachuting to safety.
