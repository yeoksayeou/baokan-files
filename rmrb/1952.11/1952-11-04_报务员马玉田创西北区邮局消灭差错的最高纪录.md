    Telegraph Operator Ma Yutian Sets Northwest Region Post Office Record for Eliminating Errors
    To the Editor: Ma Yutian, a telegraph operator at the Ningxia Post and Telecommunications Bureau's Telegraph Service Group, sent and received 22,964 telegrams, totaling 1,246,123 characters, from June of last year to September of this year, with only one error. This has set the highest record for eliminating errors in the Northwest Region post offices.
    The reason Ma Yutian has been able to eliminate errors is because of his high sense of responsibility. After taking over his shift, the first thing he does is to check the telegram transmitting and receiving machines, such as checking whether the perforating machine is leaking dots and whether the lines are normal. If he finds any problems, he immediately repairs them. In his work, he boldly questions perforated telegrams. If he encounters telegrams with unclear writing, he first clarifies them before perforating, never being careless. He is also good at listening to the sound of the perforating machine. When he hears an abnormal sound, he knows that the perforating machine has a problem and can find the cause of the error, thereby finding ways to prevent it.

    报务员马玉田创西北区邮局消灭差错的最高纪录
    编辑同志：宁夏邮电局报务组报务员马玉田，自去年六月起至今年九月止，收发电报二万二千九百六十四次，拍出电报一百二十四万六千一百二十三个字，只发生了一次差错，创造了西北区邮局消灭差错的最高纪录。
    马玉田所以能够消灭差错，是因为他有高度负责的精神。他接班后，第一件工作就是检查收发电报的机器，如检查凿机是否漏点、线路是否正常等。发现毛病之后，就马上修理。在工作中，他大胆怀疑凿孔的电报。遇有字迹不清的电报，就先问明再凿，不马虎从事。他并善于听凿孔机的声音，当听到不正常的声音时，他知道凿孔机有了毛病，就能找出发生错误的原因，从而设法加以防止。丁毅飞
