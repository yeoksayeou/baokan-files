Xinhua News Agency Report: The United Nations General Assembly's Special Political Committee held meetings on the 4th and 5th of this month to continue discussing the treatment of people of Indian descent in the Union of South Africa. The discussion on this proposal concluded at the meeting held on the 7th.

During the meetings on the 4th and 5th, discussions focused on the proposal jointly submitted by India and thirteen other countries to the committee on the 3rd. This proposal advocated for the establishment of a "Conciliation Committee" to facilitate negotiations between India, Pakistan, and South Africa, so that this issue could be resolved in a manner consistent with the principles of the United Nations Charter.

During the discussion, the representative of Thailand announced that Thailand was willing to be one of the proponents of this proposal. Representatives from Syria, Burma, Indonesia, Afghanistan, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Lebanon, Haiti, Liberia, Yugoslavia, Egypt, and the Philippines expressed their support for the proposal.

The representative of Mexico requested that South Africa agree to hold negotiations to resolve this issue. The representative of Brazil also expressed hope that a way could be found to resume direct negotiations between the parties involved in the dispute, and he said that if this were not possible, Brazil would support the proposal.

The Polish representative, Mr. Michalowski, stated that the purpose of South Africa's racial discrimination laws and traditions was to economically enslave people of color, so that they would forever be like livestock-like labor in agriculture, mining, or industry, and continue to be in a state of poverty, darkness, and deprivation of rights. He compared South Africa's cruel policies to Hitler's and the Nazi's racial discrimination programs. He urged the General Assembly to recall how the Polish people had been persecuted by the fascist laws that conspired to exterminate them. He said that capitalists are intensifying the implementation of fascist-like terror and intensifying war preparations. Therefore, now is the time to oppose fascism and oppose genocide. South Africa's actions are part of an attempt to stop the tide of oppressed peoples fighting for freedom. This action threatens the peaceful coexistence of all countries in the world. Therefore, the Polish representative will vote in favor of this joint proposal.

Representatives from Australia, New Zealand, the Netherlands, and France spoke against the proposal, insisting that the purpose of the proposal was to interfere in the internal affairs of the Union of South Africa. The U.S. representative, Mr. Sprague, said that the United States supports the part of the proposal that stipulates the establishment of a "Conciliation Committee". However, he opposed the part of the proposal that urges the Union of South Africa to suspend the implementation of the "apartheid law" before negotiations and that the "Conciliation Committee" should submit a report to the next General Assembly and include this issue on the agenda of the next General Assembly.

At the meeting on the 7th, representatives from African, Asian, and some South American countries unanimously condemned the racial discrimination policies implemented by the government of the Union of South Africa in their speeches and expressed their support for the recommendations made by India and fifteen other countries.

The Polish representative, Mr. Michalowski, criticized the United Nations for failing to stop the persecution of Indians in the Union of South Africa. Mr. Michalowski emphasized that the policies of Poland, the Soviet Union, and all people's democratic countries are based on the principles of equality and friendly cooperation among all nations. He said that the Polish delegation will support the proposal put forward by the delegations of India and fourteen other countries.

Representatives of colonial countries attempted to remove this discussion from the agenda of the United Nations General Assembly meeting.

At the committee's meeting on November 7th, the Soviet representative, the Foreign Minister of the Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic, Mr. Kuchkarov, spoke. He said that the Soviet delegation's position on the status of people of Indian descent in the Union of South Africa is based on a fundamental principle of Soviet state policy. This principle is that all people, regardless of race, have equal rights in all aspects of political, economic, and cultural life. The Soviet representative pointed out that the colonial countries' representatives’ claim that the United Nations has no right to discuss the issue of South Africa's persecution of Indians is unfounded. He said that the issue under discussion is of an international nature. Therefore, studying this issue at the United Nations General Assembly is fully in line with the United Nations Charter.

The Soviet representative said that the government of the Union of South Africa is pursuing a policy of racial discrimination in violation of the United Nations Charter. He asked the committee to pay attention to the law promulgated by the government of the Union of South Africa in 1950 to establish fixed residential areas for many races. According to this law, all the people of the Union of South Africa are divided into three categories: white people, natives, and people of color. These three types of people can only live in specially designated areas.

The Soviet representative emphasized that the United Nations cannot, and should not, ignore the facts of racial discrimination that violate the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter. The United Nations should condemn the policies and actions of the government of the Union of South Africa that discriminate against Indians and other non-European residents in that country. The Soviet delegation advocates a peaceful resolution to the issue of the status of Indians in the Union of South Africa, and resolving this issue in accordance with the spirit of the principles and goals of the United Nations and the United Nations Charter.

The Soviet representative finally said that, therefore, the Soviet delegation supports the proposal put forward by the delegation of India and fourteen other countries, but it is necessary to remove the proposed amendments, if the mediation committee stipulated in the first section of the proposal is formed after consultations with the governments concerned.

This proposal will be put to a vote on November 10.

    联大特别政委会结束讨论南非印度籍人民地位问题
    苏波等国代表斥责南非联邦种族歧视政策
    据新华社讯：联合国大会特别政治委员会四、五两日举行会议，继续讨论南非联邦印度籍人民所受到的待遇问题，七日举行的会议则已将此一提案讨论完毕。
    在四、五两日会议上，讨论集中在印度和其他十三个国家三日在委员会里联合提出的提案上，这个提案主张成立一个“斡旋委员会”，来促进印度、巴基斯坦与南非之间的谈判，以便使这个问题能得到一个符合联合国宪章原则的解决。
    在讨论中，泰国代表宣布泰国愿作为这个提案的提案国之一。叙利亚、缅甸、印尼、阿富汗、沙特阿拉伯、伊朗、黎巴嫩、海地、利比里亚、南斯拉夫、埃及和菲律宾的代表表示支持这个提案。
    墨西哥代表要求南非同意举行谈判，以便解决这个问题。巴西代表也表示希望能够设法使纠纷有关方面恢复直接谈判，他又说：假如这不可能的话，巴西将支持这个提案。
    波兰代表米查劳夫斯基发言指出，南非的种族歧视的法律和传统的目的是在经济上奴役有色民族，使有色民族永远是农业、矿业或工业里像牛马一样的劳动力，使他们继续处于贫乏、黑暗和被剥夺权利的状态中。他把南非的残酷政策比作希特勒和纳粹分子的种族歧视纲领，他促请大会回忆一下波兰人民曾怎样地受过阴谋灭绝他们的法西斯法律的迫害。他说：资本家正在加紧实行类似法西斯的恐怖手段，加紧备战，因此，现在是反对法西斯主义和反对灭种屠杀的时候了。南非的行动是打算阻止被压迫人民争取自由斗争浪潮的企图的一部分，这种行动威胁了世界各国的和平共存。因此，波兰代表将投票赞成这个联合提案。
    澳大利亚、新西兰、荷兰和法国代表发言反对这个提案，硬说提案的目的是干涉南非联邦的内政。美国代表史普拉格说：美国支持提案中规定成立“斡旋委员会”的一部分。但是，他反对提案中规定敦促南非联邦在谈判以前暂停实施“种族隔离法”以及“斡旋委员会”应向下届大会提出报告并将这一问题列入下届大会议程的部分。
    在七日会议上，非洲、亚洲国家和一些南美国家的代表在发言中一致谴责南非联邦政府所施行的种族歧视政策，并表示支持印度等十五个国家提出的建议。
    波兰代表米查劳夫斯基抨击联合国，说它没有能够制止南非联邦对印度人的迫害。米查劳夫斯基着重指出：波兰、苏联以及所有的人民民主国家的政策，都是以一切民族平等、友爱合作的原则为基础的。他说：波兰代表团将支持印度和其他十四个国家的代表团所提出的提案。
    殖民国家的代表企图把这一讨论从联合国大会会议议程上撤销。
    在委员会十一月七日的会议上，苏联代表、乌兹别克苏维埃社会主义共和国外交部长库赤卡罗夫发言。他说：苏联代表团对于南非联邦印度籍人民地位问题的立场，是根据苏维埃国家政策的一项基本原则决定的。这项原则就是：一切人民，不分种族，在政治、经济与文化生活各方面都有平等的权利。苏联代表指出：殖民国家代表所说的联合国无权讨论南非联邦迫害印度人问题是没有根据的，他说：正在讨论中的问题具有国际性质。因此，在联合国大会上研究这个问题是完全符合联合国宪章的。
    苏联代表说：南非联邦政府正在违反联合国宪章奉行一个种族歧视的政策，他要求委员会注意南非联邦政府在一九五○年颁布的为许多种族建立固定居住区的法律，根据这个法律，南非联邦的全体人民被分为三类，即：白种人、土著和有色人。这三种人都只能住在特别划定的地区。
    苏联代表着重指出：联合国不能，也不应对违反联合国宪章的目的和原则的种族歧视的事实置之不理。联合国应该谴责南非联邦政府歧视该国印度人以及其他非欧洲居民的政策和行为。苏联代表团主张和平解决南非联邦的印度人的地位问题，并按照联合国的原则和目标的精神以及联合国宪章解决这个问题。
    苏联代表最后说：因此，苏联代表团支持印度和十四个其他国家的代表团提出的提案，但需要去掉其中所建议的修正案，假如提案的第一节所规定的调解委员会是经过有关政府磋商以后才产生的话。
    这个提案将于十一月十日交付表决。
