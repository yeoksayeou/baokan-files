    Reasonably Solving Employees' Leisure Time
    Technical and Cultural Learning are Guaranteed
    To the Editor: Before our factory implemented a reasonable allocation of employees' leisure time, I often suffered from dizziness and frequently took sick leave. At that time, I didn't know the reason, but now I understand that it was because I spent too much time attending meetings and had too little time to rest.
    I am an electrical repair apprentice in the electrical department of the Shijingshan Power Plant, seventeen years old, and a member of the New Democratic Youth League. Previously, I was both the study group leader and the party's propagandist. Every day, in addition to working eight hours, sleeping six hours, and eating three meals, I spent almost all the remaining time on cultural and technical studies, participating in Youth League and trade union activities, and doing propaganda work for the workshop, totaling more than fourteen hours a week; sometimes I had to stay up late to write quick clappers. As a result, I didn't do my work well, didn't learn my studies well, and my body couldn't take it. I was worried about this problem when the higher authorities really thought it through. Starting from August, our factory has truly achieved a reasonable allocation of employees' leisure time. Although this regulation has not been implemented for a long time, I have personally experienced two most prominent benefits:
    (1) The relationship between master and apprentice has become closer, and technical learning has made significant progress. Previously, my master was Huang Zhenyou, the chairman of the workshop trade union, who was extremely busy all day long. Since we signed the master-apprentice contract, we rarely had time to work together during the day, and there was no time to study technology at night. At that time, I was always thinking about attending meetings, and I didn't focus on my work, and my work diary was written very simply, so my technical progress was very slow. Now my master is Zhao Rongjiu, the production team leader and a member of the Youth League branch committee. In the past, he was also very busy, but since the implementation of the reasonable allocation of leisure time regulations, he has had time to patiently teach me. Every night at nine o'clock, we always meet in the dormitory to discuss and study the master-apprentice contract. We summarize it once every half month. I write my work diary seriously. The master also carefully reads and revises my diary. Recently, I have often not worked with the master, but it's not because he doesn't have the time, but because he is confident enough to let me work alone.
    (2) I can keep up with cultural studies, and I am no longer criticized. In the past, because of too many extracurricular activities, I never submitted homework, failed the exams, and simply stopped attending classes. People criticized me for "a Youth League member who doesn't love learning," and my group leader position was also removed. At that time, I felt very uncomfortable, and I didn't have time to review the lessons. Now the situation is different. Every Monday, Wednesday, and Thursday morning, there is time to review lessons; with unified regulations for extracurricular activities, I also have free time to study. Recently, I made an effort and have caught up with the cultural courses.
    With plenty of rest time, I feel like singing a song when I walk, I am full of energy, and I no longer suffer from dizziness.

### 合理解决职工业余活动时间  技术和文化学习才有了保证

    合理解决职工业余活动时间
    技术和文化学习才有了保证
    编辑同志：在我们厂没有实行合理支配职工业余活动时间以前，我老爱犯头晕病，常请病假。那时我不知道是什么原因，现在才明白，原来是参加开会的时间过多，休息的时间太少。
    我是石景山发电厂电气场的电气修理学徒工，今年十七岁，是新民主主义青年团员。以前我兼学习小组长，又是党的宣传员。每天除了干八小时活，睡六小时觉，和吃三顿饭以外，剩下来的时间差不多就全部搞文化、技术学习，参加团和工会的活动，做车间的宣传工作，每周总在十四小时以上；有时候为了编快板一直得熬到深夜。这样搞的结果，工作没做好，学习没学好，身体也支持不住了。我正在为这个问题发愁，上级可真想得周到，从八月份开始，我们厂真正做到了合理支配职工的业余活动时间。这一规定实行的时间虽不算长，但从我切身体会到的有这么最突出的两点好处：
    （一）师徒关系密切起来了，技术学习有了显著的进步。以前我的师傅是黄振有，他是车间工会主席，整天忙得够呛。自从我们俩订了师徒合同以来，白天很少有时间和他在一块干活，晚上也没有空研究技术学习。那时候我老惦着要开会，工作不踏实，工作日记也写得很简单，因此我的技术进步得很慢。现在我的师傅是赵荣久，他是生产小组长，是团的支部委员，按过去他也挺忙的，可是自从实行了合理支配业余时间规定以后，他可有时间耐心地教我了。每天晚上九时，我们一定在宿舍见面，讨论研究师徒合同的问题。每一个半月作一次总结。我写工作日记认真了。师傅也认真改阅我的日记。最近我也经常不跟师傅在一块干活，但这可不是他没功夫，而是他已经放心让我单独干了。
    （二）文化学习跟得上，不再挨批评了。以前因为业余活动过多，从来就没交过作业，考试时不及格，往后就干脆不上课了。人家都批评我“青年团员还不爱学习”，把我的小组长也给撤了。那时我心里可难受呢，想赶也没有时间温课。现在情形可就不一样，每个星期一、三、四的早晨都有复习功课的时间；业余活动时间有了统一的规定，自己也就有了自由学习的时间了。最近我努了一把力，也就跟上了文化课了。
    有了充分的休息时间，走起道来也有心思唱个歌，精神饱满，头也不再犯晕病了。    林秀清
