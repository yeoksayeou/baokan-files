   Actively Guide Peasants in Preparing for the Pilot Establishment of Agricultural Production Cooperatives
    This year, over three thousand agricultural production cooperatives have been established on a trial basis across the country. The vast majority of these cooperatives have achieved excellent harvests. Consequently, in areas influenced by these cooperatives, the broad masses of peasants are enthusiastically requesting to establish cooperatives. This is a very gratifying phenomenon, and we should attach great importance to the enthusiasm of the peasant masses for advancing in the direction of collectivization.

    However, along with the enthusiasm of the masses, blind establishment of cooperatives has been observed in some areas. This phenomenon arises from a lack of concrete understanding of agricultural production cooperatives among some rural cadres and the masses. They view establishing a cooperative as a simple and easy task. They think that simply breaking up the land boundaries and putting everyone's livestock together is all it takes. This is certainly incorrect. The article about the Guo Yu'en Agricultural Production Cooperative in Chuandi Village, Shanxi, published in today's newspaper, fully illustrates this point. The Guo Yu'en cooperative was one of the earliest and most successful pilot cooperatives, but it developed and consolidated itself by solving a multitude of problems. An agricultural production cooperative is a collective production organization based on private ownership. While it solves the contradictions of scattered management and collective labor that mutual aid teams cannot, and it can meet the demands of farmers to expand reproduction, it also generates a series of new contradictions between the individual and the collective. These new contradictions are new problems for many of our cadres and the broad masses of peasants. These new problems can only be easily resolved when the masses have production needs, have experience in mutual aid and cooperation, have a relatively strong leading core, and genuinely and voluntarily want to establish a cooperative. The reason why many problems of the Guo Yu'en Agricultural Production Cooperative could be solved one by one is that it possessed these conditions. Without these conditions, relying solely on enthusiasm and rushing headlong into action will not lead to well-run agricultural production cooperatives.

    Currently, it is the period for rectifying mutual aid teams and preparing to establish cooperatives. Local leading organs should conduct in-depth inspections and understand the demands and ideological situation of the masses, and carefully summarize the experience of pilot agricultural production cooperatives over the past year, so that they have a clear understanding in their minds and can strengthen their leadership over the mutual aid and cooperation movement. At present, we urgently need to do the following work: for those cooperatives that have already been well-established, we must earnestly help them solve the problems in their development so that they can further advance; for those mutual aid teams that already possess the conditions for establishing a cooperative and the masses genuinely and voluntarily request to establish a cooperative, we must introduce them to the experience and actively guide them in establishing a cooperative; for those cooperatives that have been established but have many problems and poor production results, that is, those that do not yet possess the conditions for establishing a cooperative, we must carry out patient persuasion and education work, and let them change to mutual aid teams according to the existing conditions, first run the mutual aid teams well, and actively create the conditions for establishing a cooperative.

    The Party's policy on agricultural production cooperatives is one of active and steady development. It is wrong not to actively try to meet the demands of the masses to establish cooperatives; it is also wrong to allow the masses to develop freely without control. We should adopt a method that combines leadership control with the enthusiasm of the masses, and actively guide the masses in preparing for the pilot establishment of agricultural production cooperatives.

   积极领导农民进行试办农业生产合作社的准备工作
    今年全国已经试办了三千多个农业生产合作社。绝大部分农业生产合作社都得到了优异的收获。因此，在合作社影响所及的地方，广大农民群众纷纷要求办社。这是一个十分可喜的现象，我们应该十分重视农民群众这种向合作化方向前进的热情。
    但伴随着群众这种热情而来的，有不少地方已发现了盲目办社的现象。这种盲目办社的现象，是由于一部分农村干部和群众对农业生产合作社缺乏具体了解而产生的。他们把办社看作一件简单容易的事情。他们以为只要把地界打破，把各家的牲口牵在一起，就可以办社了。这当然是不对的。今天本报所发表的关于山西川底村郭玉恩农业生产合作社的文章，充分地说明了这一点。郭玉恩合作社是试办最早也很有成绩的一个合作社，但这个社是在解决了许许多多的问题的过程中发展巩固起来的。农业生产合作社是建立在私有基础上的集体生产组织，它虽然解决了互助组所不能解决的分散经营和集体劳动的矛盾，能满足农民扩大再生产的要求，但它本身又产生了一连串个人与集体的新的矛盾。这些新的矛盾，对于我们许多干部和广大农民说来都还是新的问题。这些新的问题，必须在群众有了生产上的需要、有了互助合作的经验、有了较强的领导骨干而又真正在自觉自愿办社的条件下才易于解决。郭玉恩农业生产合作社的许多问题之所以能够一一获得解决，就是由于它已具备了这些条件。假如没有这些条件，只凭一股热情，急躁冒进，是不能把农业生产合作社办好的。
    目前正是整顿互助组和准备办社的时期。各地领导机关应该深入检查、了解群众的要求和思想情况，很好地总结一年来试办农业生产合作社的经验，使自己心中有数，以便加强对互助合作运动的领导。目前我们亟须做好以下工作：对那些已经办好的社，要切实帮助它们解决发展中的问题，使它们能够进一步地向前发展；对那些已具备建社条件而群众又真正自愿要求办社的互助组，要向他们介绍经验，积极地领导他们建社；对那些办起来了，但问题很多，生产成绩很坏，也就是尚未具备建社条件的社，要对他们进行耐心的说服教育工作，让他们根据现有条件改为互助组，首先把互助组搞好，积极创造建社条件。
    党对农业生产合作社的方针是积极地、稳步地发展的方针。不积极设法去满足群众的办社要求是不对的；一任群众自流发展而不加以控制也是错误的。我们应该采取领导控制与群众热情相结合的办法，积极领导群众进行试办农业生产合作社的准备工作。
