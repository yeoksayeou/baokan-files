Comrades!

The directives on the Fifth Five-Year Plan for the development of the Soviet Union (1951-1955) are now submitted to you for examination. The new five-year plan will continue the line of the previous five-year plans for the peaceful development of the Soviet economy, the continuous improvement of the socialist economy, and the welfare of the people. The implementation of this plan will be an important stage in our country's gradual transition from socialism to communism.

Based on the completion of the Fourth Five-Year Plan, our country has achieved tremendous successes in economic construction and cultural development. The basic task of the five-year plan for the restoration and development of the Soviet national economy from 1946 to 1950 was to restore the various regions of our country that had suffered from the war, to restore the pre-war level of industry and agriculture, and then to greatly exceed this level. From the summary of the implementation of the Fourth Five-Year Plan that was announced at that time, it can be known that this plan was successfully completed, and the most important tasks of the plan were greatly overfulfilled.

Due to the completion of the Fourth Five-Year Plan, the pre-war level of development of the Soviet national economy has been greatly exceeded. In terms of industrial output, the five-year plan was completed four years and three months ahead of schedule, so the total industrial output in 1950 was 73% higher than before the war. Due to the high-speed development of industry, the national economy has completed a large-scale further technological armament, and each sector of the national economy has added the most advanced machinery of our country.

In the field of agriculture, in terms of the unit area yield and total yield of crops, as well as the quantity of livestock products, all have greatly exceeded the pre-war level.

With the growth of the main sectors of the national economy, various means of transportation have also developed, and freight transport has greatly exceeded the pre-war level.

On the basis of the high tide of the national economy, the welfare of the working people has improved, and national consumption has greatly exceeded the pre-war level. In 1950, the national income of the Soviet Union increased by 64% compared to 1940. The production of daily necessities has greatly expanded, currency reform has been implemented, the rationing of all food and industrial products has been abolished, trade has been widely developed, retail prices have been reduced several times, and the Soviet ruble has been further strengthened. In 1950, the total income of workers and employees and farmers increased by 62% compared to 1940.

The five-year plan for the restoration and development of the Soviet national economy from 1946 to 1950 was completed without any foreign aid and without foreign loans, relying solely on domestic resources. In the completion and overfulfillment of the plan, the decisive role was played by the selfless labor of the Soviet people led by the Communist Party under the great leadership of Stalin. (Applause) The successful completion of the Fourth Five-Year Plan has further consolidated the socialist system, formed a new great victory of the Soviet Union, and ensured the further growth of the power of the socialist state.

The successful completion of the Fourth Five-Year Plan enables us to ensure, through the Fifth Five-Year Plan, the further high tide of various sectors of the national economy, the growth of the material welfare of the working people, the development of public health, and the improvement of the cultural level of the people.

Now, let us use the following figures to illustrate the most important tasks in the directives of the Fifth Five-Year Plan.

1. Tasks of the Fifth Five-Year Plan in the Industrial Sector

The directives of the Fifth Five-Year Plan stipulate that the level of industrial production in 1955 will be approximately 70% higher than in 1950. This means that by the end of the Fifth Five-Year Plan, the total industrial output will be three times that of the pre-war period. During the five-year period, the total industrial output will increase by approximately 12% per year on average, with the growth rate of production of means of production being 13%, and the growth rate of production of consumer goods being 11%. During the Fourth Five-Year Plan period, the growth rate of total industrial output was higher. The reason why the growth rate of industrial products in the Fifth Five-Year Plan period is slightly lower than that in the Fourth Five-Year Plan period is, on the one hand, because the restoration work of industry has been completed, and the rapid expansion of production at that time was achieved through the restored enterprises; on the other hand, because in the new five-year plan period, it is necessary to further greatly improve the quality of products and expand their varieties. At the same time, it should be estimated that in the new five-year plan period, for every 1% increase in total output, it is almost equivalent to the increase in the Fourth Five-Year Plan period.

Metallurgy is the foundation of industrial and overall national economic development. The five-year plan directives stipulate that by 1955, the output of pig iron will increase by approximately 76% compared to 1950, steel by approximately 62%, and rolled metal by approximately 64%. The increase in rolled metal production over the five-year period will exceed the annual output of 1940. To better meet the needs of the construction industry and the machinery manufacturing industry, it is necessary to increase the production of various rolled metals that are in short supply, such as thick steel plates, thin steel plates, steel wire, and stainless steel plates, and to develop the production of various types of economical rolled metals, increase the production of special steels and alloys, and improve their quality.

The most important condition for the above-mentioned growth in black metal production is to further improve the utilization of the existing production capacity of metallurgical enterprises. To this end, it is stipulated to further accelerate the metallurgical process, accelerate the automation of the control of the metallurgical process, and accelerate the mechanization of labor-intensive work in metallurgical enterprises.

It is necessary to implement a massive plan to build new black metal smelting enterprises and expand existing black metal smelting enterprises. During the Fifth Five-Year Plan period, the production capacity of pig iron will increase by approximately 32% compared to the Fourth Five-Year Plan, the production capacity of steel will increase by approximately 42%, the production capacity of rolled metal will at least double, the production capacity of coke will increase by approximately 80%, and the production capacity of iron ore will increase by approximately three times. In addition to further developing the black metal smelting industry in the southern regions, the Urals, Siberia, the central regions, and the northwestern regions, it is also necessary to ensure the development of the smelting industry in the southern Caucasus region. At the same time, it is necessary to carry out prospecting and design work for iron ore deposits in the Karelian-Finnish Republic.

It is necessary to greatly expand the production of non-ferrous metals. During the five-year period, the production of refined copper will increase by approximately 90%, lead by approximately 2.7 times, aluminum by at least 2.6 times, zinc by approximately 2.5 times, nickel by approximately 53%, and tin by approximately 80%. With the increase in the production of non-ferrous metals, it will be possible to further improve and adopt new technological processes that ensure the increase in the output of high-quality metals. In line with the tasks of non-ferrous metal production, it is necessary to develop the raw material base of the non-ferrous metal smelting industry, mechanize mining and labor-intensive work as much as possible, and greatly improve the work of smelting enterprises in the utilization of ore raw materials.

The most important condition for achieving the growth rates of production and technological improvement in various sectors of the national economy is to further electrify the country. The electricity generation in 1955 will increase by approximately 80% compared to 1950. This will enable us to raise the level of industrial electrification, widely promote the automation of the production process, further adopt new methods of electric heating and electrolysis, greatly expand the use of electricity in agriculture, implement the further electrification of railways, and increase electricity generation to meet the needs of people's lives.

To ensure the increase in electricity generation and to increase the reserve capacity of the power system, it is stipulated to rapidly increase the generating capacity of power plants. During the five-year period, the total generating capacity of power plants will increase by approximately two times, and the generating capacity of hydroelectric power plants will increase by approximately three times. At the same time, the increase in the generating capacity of thermal power plants should be mainly guaranteed by the expansion of existing power plants.

According to the decision of the government, during the Fifth Five-Year Plan period, it is necessary to widely build hydroelectric power plants and build thermal power plants at fuel production sites.

Among the hydroelectric power plants under construction, the following should be mentioned first: the Kuybyshev hydroelectric power plant and the Stalingrad hydroelectric power plant on the Volga River, and the Kakhovka hydroelectric power plant on the Dnieper River. The Kuybyshev hydroelectric power plant with a generating capacity of 2.1 million kilowatts will start generating electricity in 1955, which will greatly increase the power supply in the central regions and the Volga River basin. It is stipulated to build a 400,000-volt power transmission line from the Kuybyshev hydroelectric power plant to Moscow. Such equipment has not been seen in the world's power engineering practice. During the Fifth Five-Year Plan period, in addition to the Kuybyshev hydroelectric power plant, it is necessary to complete the construction of such large hydroelectric power plants as the Kama, Gorky, Ming-Khauz, Ust-Kamenogorsk, and others, which will start generating electricity during this five-year period and have a generating capacity of about 2 million kilowatts. In addition, various regional and local hydroelectric power plants will be built. The construction of the Stalingrad, Kakhovka, and Novosibirsk hydroelectric power plants will be widely promoted, and the construction of new large hydroelectric power plants will begin: the Cheboksary hydroelectric power plant on the Volga River, the Votkinsk hydroelectric power plant on the Kama River, the Bukhtarma hydroelectric power plant on the Irtysh River, and others. It is necessary to begin the comprehensive utilization of the power resources of the Angara River to develop the aluminum industry, chemical industry, mining industry, and other industrial sectors on the basis of cheap electricity and local raw materials.

To seriously improve the power supply in the southern regions, the Urals, and the Kuzbas, it is stipulated to greatly increase the generating capacity of thermal power plants in various regions and factories. In addition to building giant power plants, it is also necessary to build small and medium-sized power plants to improve the power supply in various cities and regions; to widely supply heat to cities and industrial enterprises, it is necessary to continue the construction of thermal power plants.

In giant thermal power plants, high-pressure boilers and turbines will be installed as usual. In power plants, the automation of the production process will be widely adopted.

In the directives of the Fifth Five-Year Plan, it is stipulated to further greatly develop the petroleum industry. During the five-year period, the oil extraction volume will increase by approximately 85%. To ensure the above-mentioned increase in oil extraction, it is necessary to strengthen drilling work, widely adopt new drilling methods, and implement the automation of the oil extraction process on a large scale. The implementation of the large-scale oil extraction plan requires the acceleration of the development of the refining industry and the proximity of the refining industry to the regions using oil products. During the five-year period, the production capacity of refineries will increase as follows: the production capacity of primary refineries will increase by approximately two times, and the production capacity of crude oil refineries will increase by approximately 2.7 times. At the same time, it is necessary to master and adopt new refining methods to ensure a great increase in the extraction of light fractions. It is necessary to greatly develop the transportation of oil and oil products through pipelines. To develop the production of synthetic liquid fuels, it is necessary to start the operation of large enterprises in the eastern regions of our country.

During the Fifth Five-Year Plan period, it is necessary to ensure the further widespread development of the gas industry. During the five-year period, the production of natural gas, associated gas, and gas produced from coal and shale will increase by approximately 80%. It is necessary to expand the use of gas to meet the needs of life, expand the use of gas as automotive fuel, and obtain chemicals from gas.

The coal industry, with the great comprehensive assistance of the Party and the Soviet government, has greatly increased in the post-war years. It is known that it fully meets the needs of the national economy. During the new five-year plan period, it is stipulated that the coal extraction volume will increase by approximately 43%. The most important task of the coal industry is to ensure a faster increase in the extraction of coking coal and to greatly expand the coal washing work. The extraction of coking coal will increase by at least 50%, and the coal washing work will increase by approximately 2.7 times. It is stipulated that the coal mine production capacity will increase by approximately 30% compared to the Fourth Five-Year Plan period. To ensure the achievement of the stipulated increase in coal extraction, improve productivity, and reduce the labor intensity of workers in the coal industry, it is necessary to further improve the methods of coal mining, develop the mechanization of the most labor-intensive operations in coal mining—loading coal in the mining face, loading coal and stone in the excavation process, and widely adopt the most advanced machinery and machinery to expand the mechanization of coal mining.

It is necessary to further develop the peat and shale industry. During the five-year period, the extraction of peat will increase by 27%, and the extraction of shale will increase by 2.3 times, especially in the Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic.

In ensuring the high-speed development of the national economy, in ensuring the further technological armament of industry, transportation, and agriculture, the machinery manufacturing industry plays a huge role. Based on this, it is stipulated in the Fifth Five-Year Plan to further rapidly develop the machinery manufacturing industry. During the five-year period, the output of the machinery manufacturing industry and metal products will increase by approximately two times. The most important task of the machinery manufacturing industry is to fully supply power plants, black metal smelting, non-ferrous metal smelting, refineries, synthetic liquid fuel plants, and chemical plants with various equipment. It is stipulated that during this five-year period, the output of the most important equipment will increase compared to the Fourth Five-Year Plan period as follows: steam turbines and hydro turbines will increase by approximately 4.3 times, rolling equipment will increase by approximately 2.8 times, and refining equipment will increase by approximately 5.2 times.

At the same time, it is necessary to greatly increase the production of chemical equipment, lifting and transporting equipment, and the production of extremely heavy lifting cranes and bridge-type electric cranes for smelting, as well as the production of complete sets of equipment for manufacturing building materials, the production of automatic equipment for light industry and food industry, especially weaving machines, the production of various new agricultural machinery, and the production of equipment for logging, pulp and paper, and wood processing industries.

It is necessary to increase the production of mainline locomotives, diesel locomotives, electric locomotives, and carriages to meet the needs of railway transportation.

The production of tractors and automobiles, especially diesel trucks with large load capacity and gas trucks, will be increased.

It is necessary to greatly develop the shipbuilding industry for marine vessels, inland vessels, and fishing vessels.

It is necessary to further develop the production of machine tools and precision machinery. Ensuring the supply of the national economy with advanced technology equipment is mainly dependent on the development level of these two industries.

During the Fifth Five-Year Plan period, it will be necessary to supply the industry with highly efficient metal-cutting machine tools and casting presses, the quantity of which will be much greater than that of the Fourth Five-Year Plan period. Among them, the production of giant and rare machine tools will increase by approximately 3.6 times, and the production of highly accurate (precision) machine tools will increase by approximately four times. This will greatly increase the proportion of various advanced machine tools, ensure the further improvement of the technical level of the machinery manufacturing industry, and ensure that the output of technically perfect machines and equipment can meet the needs of the Soviet national economy and the friendly democratic countries with the Soviet Union.

In the conditions of modern large-scale machine production, the instrument manufacturing industry has increasingly great significance. Instrument production is a necessary and important supplement to the production of complex machines because the operation of complex machines, as well as the operation of all modernized technological processes, cannot be done without a complete set of instruments. The growth of instrument production also reflects the development of production automation—one of the most important signs of technological progress. The directives stipulate that during the five-year period, the production of control instruments and inspection instruments will increase by approximately 2.7 times.

The great development of various sectors of the machinery manufacturing industry enables us to basically complete the mechanization of heavy and labor-intensive work in industry and construction during the Fifth Five-Year Plan period, which is an outstanding achievement in further arming the national economy with technology, improving productivity, and reducing the labor intensity of workers.

In the chemical industry, the production of soda, synthetic rubber, mineral fertilizers should achieve high-speed growth. Compared to 1950, the production of soda ash will increase by approximately 84%, caustic soda by approximately 79%, synthetic rubber by approximately 82%, and mineral fertilizers by approximately 88%. It is necessary to greatly increase the production capacity of ammonia, sulfuric acid, synthetic rubber, synthetic alcohol, soda, mineral fertilizers, chemicals for the elimination of crop pests and diseases, and granular fertilizers that ensure a great increase in crop yields. At the same time, it is necessary to increase the production of plastics, dyes, synthetic fiber raw materials, expand the varieties of chemical products, and develop the production of synthetic materials—substitutes for non-ferrous metals.

The timber industry is still lagging behind the growing needs of the national economy. The task is to eliminate this backwardness. During the five-year period, the volume of timber transportation on economic roads should increase by approximately 56%, and the production of timber should increase by approximately 50%. At the same time, it is necessary to greatly transfer the logging industry to large forest areas, especially the northern, Ural, and Karelian-Finnish Soviet Socialist Republic regions, and reduce the logging work in regions with few forests. It is necessary to reduce the seasonality of the logging industry, transform and build new mechanized logging sites in logging areas, and equip these logging sites with fixed personnel. At the same time, it is necessary to further promote the comprehensive mechanization of logging work, improve the organization of production and the utilization of equipment, and improve the labor productivity of logging work. To increase the production of sawn timber, in regions where the logging industry is developed, it is necessary to increase the production capacity of timber factories by approximately eight times compared to the Fourth Five-Year Plan period.

It is necessary to strive to develop the paper, pulp, furniture, composite board, wood chemical, and hydrolysis industries.

The building materials industry faces a huge task. The implementation of the basic construction plan stipulates that during the five-year period, the production of major building materials should at least double, improve the quality of building materials, and expand their varieties. It is necessary to increase the production of cement by approximately 2.2 times, the production of wall materials by approximately 2.3 times, the production of roofing slates by approximately 2.6 times, the production of soft roofs by approximately 70%, and the production of tiles by approximately three times. At the same time, it is necessary to greatly increase the production of new types of factory-made building materials, components, and complete sets of materials made of ceramics, gypsum, concrete, and reinforced concrete for decoration and covering, which is necessary for the further industrialization of the construction industry and the reduction of construction costs.

Based on the development of heavy industry and agriculture, during the five-year period, it is necessary to ensure the high-speed increase in the production of consumer goods. The raw material resources of agriculture enable the output of the light industry and food industry to increase by at least 70% during the five-year period. At the same time, in 1955, the production of cotton textiles will increase by approximately 61% compared to 1950, the production of silk textiles by approximately 54%, the production of leather shoes by approximately 55%, the production of meat by approximately 92%, the catch of fish by approximately 58%, the production of sugar by approximately 78%, the production of animal oil by approximately 72%, the production of vegetable oil by approximately 77%, and the production of canned goods by approximately 2.1 times.

Many enterprises of light industry and food industry will be built: weaving mills, spinning mills, synthetic fiber factories, silk factories, clothing factories, knitting factories, shoe factories, sugar factories, oil mills, vegetable dehydration factories, and factories for the production of confectionery, canned goods, alcoholic beverages, meat products, fish products, butter, and cheese.

At the same time, it is necessary to greatly increase the production of daily necessities, household items, and local building materials by local industrial enterprises and handicraft cooperative enterprises. During the five-year period, the industrial output of local industrial enterprises and handicraft cooperative enterprises will increase by approximately 60%. To complete this plan, local Soviets should improve the management of local industry and handicraft cooperatives to make better use of local raw materials and the waste of large state-owned enterprises, expand the varieties of daily necessities needed by residents, improve product quality, ensure the reduction of costs, and improve the workshops of local industry and handicraft cooperatives to meet the living needs of residents.

The interests of the national economy require the further expansion of product varieties and the serious improvement of their quality in various industrial sectors. Some enterprises have overfulfilled the production increase plan but have damaged the stipulated product quality and varieties, which is absolutely not allowed. Improving product quality is a top priority for our country's industry. Improving product quality can ensure the more economical use of material resources and reduce the losses caused by the production of substandard products. The improvement of the quality and varieties of consumer goods has special significance. Soviet consumers reasonably demand higher and higher quality and varieties of products. Our industry must fully meet these growing needs of residents and must not produce items that consumers do not need.

To ensure high-quality products, it is necessary to more widely adopt national standards that meet modern requirements and to more effectively use the bonus system and the material and technical supply of enterprises to complete the plans for the names and varieties of products.

The most important condition for completing the tasks of the five-year plan in the industrial sector is to fully utilize production capacity on the basis of adopting advanced norms and eliminating the shortcomings in enterprises that hinder the full utilization of equipment. It should be pointed out that during the Fourth Five-Year Plan period, many industrial sectors deliberately reduced the tasks of utilizing production capacity, but in the process of implementing the plan, they greatly overfulfilled it. This is mainly about the black metal smelting industry and the chemical industry. Until now, some industrial sectors still have the phenomenon of deliberately reducing the production capacity of enterprises; government departments do not tap the potential of these enterprises, thus limiting the development of the production of many extremely important products.

The phenomenon of government departments deliberately reducing production capacity and equipment utilization norms is not only found in the operation of factories but also in the technical design of enterprises under construction. Often, there is such a situation where an enterprise is still under construction, and the production capacity indicated in its technical design already needs to be revised without any additional funding.

Various planning organs are greatly responsible for the deliberate reduction of production capacity. The State Planning Commission of the Soviet Union should improve its work of tapping production potential and fully utilizing it to complete state orders and more resolutely fight against all tendencies of government departments to deliberately reduce production plans.

Our country has several powerful production organizations equipped with advanced technology established during the Stalin Five-Year Plans, and it has a large number of experienced and skilled workers and engineering and technical personnel. This has created a great possibility of continuously increasing production by better utilizing the existing production capacity. In the new five-year plan, it is stipulated to achieve a great increase in production by this method. For example, by improving the utilization of existing furnaces, it is possible to obtain approximately 30% of the total increase in pig iron production by 1955; by improving the utilization of coal mines, it is possible to obtain approximately 25% of the total increase in coal production; by more fully utilizing cement factories, it is possible to obtain approximately 30% of the total increase in cement production. In other industrial sectors, the improvement of the utilization of production capacity also has equally important significance.

In addition to improving the utilization of existing production capacity, the new five-year plan also stipulates a huge basic construction plan for industry.

According to the plan to increase industrial production, it is stipulated in the Fifth Five-Year Plan that the state's basic investment in industry will increase by approximately two times compared to the Fourth Five-Year Plan. It is necessary to stipulate a particularly large increase in basic investment in the development of the smelting industry, power plants, petroleum industry, and light industry enterprises. The basic construction plan should not only ensure the great use of new enterprises and machinery and equipment but also the transformation of existing machinery and equipment, the addition of new equipment, the implementation of production mechanization, and the improvement of technological processes to ensure the increase in the production capacity of existing enterprises. The expansion of existing enterprises to increase production capacity is the most important potential for increasing production with the least expenditure in the new five-year plan. At the same time, it is necessary to stipulate in the basic construction plan the preliminary creation of conditions for the establishment of smelting enterprises, power plants, refineries, coal mines, and chemical plants to ensure the necessary development of these industrial sectors in subsequent years.

During the new five-year plan period, it is necessary to improve the geographical distribution of industrial enterprise construction to make industry closer to the sources of raw materials and fuel. This will make it possible to eliminate the unreasonable and long-distance railway freight phenomenon.

To meet the growing needs of the national economy for raw materials and fuel resources, it is stipulated in the Fifth Five-Year Plan to further expand the work of prospecting various natural resources, discovering useful mineral deposits, and first of all, non-ferrous metals and rare metals, coking coal, aluminum raw materials, oil, rich iron ore, and other industrial raw materials.

The most important condition for the smooth implementation of the construction plans of industry and other sectors of the national economy is to further develop the construction industry, consolidate and expand the existing construction organizations, and establish new construction organizations in regions where large-scale construction is being carried out.

Now, the construction industry can solve tasks that are much larger and more complex than in previous years. In the post-war years, large construction organizations have been established and greatly expanded, such as the heavy industry construction department mainly engaged in the construction of black metal and non-ferrous metal smelting enterprises, the machinery manufacturing industry construction department, the construction departments of power plants, petroleum industry enterprises, coal mines and open-pit mines, railways and highways, subways, skyscrapers, etc. The heavy industry construction department based on the construction people's commissariat currently undertakes the number of construction installation projects, which is twice as large as what the construction people's commissariat could undertake in 1940. If the machinery manufacturing industry construction department is added, it is three times larger than what the construction people's commissariat could undertake in 1940. The construction organization of the power plant department currently undertakes the number of construction installation projects, which is more than four times larger than what they undertook in 1940.

However, it is necessary to further seriously strengthen the construction organizations. The directives of the five-year plan stipulate: first of all, it is necessary to strengthen the construction organizations of the heavy industry construction department, the power plant department, the petroleum industry department, the coal industry department, the railway department, and the construction organizations of the machinery manufacturing industry construction department that are building factories manufacturing power and smelting equipment, refining equipment, giant and rare machine tools, heavy casting presses, lifting and transporting equipment, etc.

It is necessary to ensure the widespread adoption of industrial methods in the construction industry, strive to expand the production of factory-made building components and building materials, concrete, plaster, and other semi-finished products. Therefore, it is stipulated to increase the production capacity of factories manufacturing metal building materials by at least two times, establish the necessary number of factories manufacturing reinforced concrete products, expand the existing quarries in various regions and organize new quarries in various regions, and implement comprehensive mechanization in the work of quarrying and processing stone blocks, gravel, small stones, sand, and natural stone blocks.

It is necessary to mechanize the main construction work and ensure the transition from the mechanization of individual work processes to the comprehensive mechanization of construction work. It is stipulated that during the five-year period, the number of excavators in the construction industry will increase by approximately 2.5 times, the number of bulldozers will increase by approximately three times, the number of road graders will increase by approximately four times, and the number of mobile cranes will increase by 4.5 times. Construction workers must seriously improve the utilization of the increasing number of machines and machinery.

It is necessary to improve the design work in the construction industry, not allow extravagance in design, shorten the design period, and ensure the timely design of construction site blueprints and estimates. Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen the design organizations with skilled personnel and widely adopt standard designs in construction.

2. Tasks of the Fifth Five-Year Plan in the Agricultural Sector

In the agricultural sector, the main task remains to further consolidate and develop the collective farm public economy, improve the work of state farms and agricultural machinery stations on the basis of the application of modern machinery and technology in agriculture, increase the yield per unit area of all crops, further increase the total number of public livestock, and at the same time greatly increase its productivity, increase the total output of agriculture and livestock products, and the output of commercial crops.

It is stipulated that the total grain output will increase by 40% to 50% during the five-year period, of which the production of wheat should increase by 55% to 65%, the production of raw cotton should increase by 55% to 65%, the production of flax fiber should increase by 40% to 50%, the production of sugar beets should increase by 65% to 70%, and the production of sunflowers should increase by 50% to 60%. Similarly, it is necessary to increase the production of potatoes, hemp, tobacco, and other crops. It is necessary to further develop fruit cultivation, viticulture, and citrus cultivation.

It is stipulated to rapidly develop livestock farming. Compared to 1950, the total output of meat and fat in 1955 will increase by 80% to 90%, the total output of milk will increase by 45% to 50%, and the total output of wool will increase by two to three and a half times. In the suburbs of Moscow, Leningrad, and other large cities and industrial centers, it is necessary to develop the production of vegetables, potatoes, milk, meat, and eggs. Our agriculture must have a higher productivity and a higher level of skills, implement advanced pasture cultivation methods and correct crop rotation, allocate more land for the cultivation of technical crops, feed, vegetables, and potatoes.

In the Fifth Five-Year Plan, it is stipulated to greatly increase the yield per unit area of crops and designate the tasks of the main regions of the country. Their tasks are as follows:

Increase the yield per hectare of grain: in the southern regions of Ukraine and the northern Caucasus, increase to 20 to 22 centners, in irrigated fields increase to 30 to 34 centners; in the Volga region, increase to 14 to 15 centners, in irrigated fields increase to 25 to 28 centners; in the central black soil regions, increase to 16 to 18 centners, in irrigated fields increase to 30 to 34 centners; in the non-black soil regions, increase to 17 to 19 centners; in the Urals, Siberia, and the northeastern regions of Kazakhstan, increase to 15 to 16 centners, in irrigated fields increase to 24 to 26 centners; in the southern Caucasus regions, increase to 20 to 22 centners, in irrigated fields increase to 30 to 34 centners; the yield per hectare of rice should increase to 40 to 50 centners.

Increase the yield per hectare of cotton: in the central regions of Asia and the southern regions of Kazakhstan, increase to 26 to 27 centners; in the southern Caucasus regions, increase to 25 to 27 centners; in the southern regions of the European part, the yield of paddy fields should increase to 11 to 13 centners, and the yield of non-paddy fields should increase to 5 to 7 centners.

Increase the yield per hectare of other crops:

Increase the yield per hectare of flax fiber in the non-black soil regions to 4.5 to 5.5 centners, in the Urals and Siberia to 4 to 5 centners.

Increase the yield per hectare of sugar beets in the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, the Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic, and the northern Caucasus regions to 255 to 265 centners, in the central black soil regions to 200 to 210 centners, in the central regions of Asia and Kazakhstan to 400 to 425 centners.

Increase the yield per hectare of potatoes in the non-black soil regions to 155 to 175 centners, in the central black soil regions to 140 to 160 centners, in the southern and northern Caucasus regions to 135 to 155 centners, in the Urals and Siberia to 125 to 145 centners.

Increase the yield per hectare of sunflowers in the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, the Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic, and the northern Caucasus regions to 17 to 20 centners, in the central black soil regions to 14.5 to 16.5 centners, in the Volga region to 10 to 12 centners.

The increase in the total output of the most important crops is mainly guaranteed by the increase in yield per unit area. Due to the increase in yield per unit area, the total grain output will increase by approximately 90%, the total raw cotton output will increase by approximately 50%, and the total sugar beet output will increase by more than 60%.

During the Fourth Five-Year Plan period, large-scale Stalin's transformation of nature has been carried out in the steppe and forest-steppe regions of the European part of the Soviet Union. Now we have the possibility of transitioning to the universal application of correct agricultural management methods. The Fifth Five-Year Plan stipulates the planting of forest belts in the fields of collective farms and state farms, not only in the steppe and forest-steppe regions of the European part of the Soviet Union but also in Siberia, Central Asia, and other regions. It is stipulated that during the five-year period, at least 2.5 million hectares of protective forest belts and approximately 2.5 million hectares of state forest belts will be planted in collective farms and state farms.

During the years of the Fourth Five-Year Plan, a lot of work has been done to implement correct crop rotation and advanced tillage methods in collective farms and state farms. However, this work has serious shortcomings. The agricultural departments of the provinces, territories, and republics, the party organizations, and the Soviet organizations must improve their work in the application of grassland crop rotation and ensure the universal adoption of correct tillage methods. The directives of the Fifth Five-Year Plan stipulate the further development of pasture cultivation as one of the most important methods to increase crop yields and consolidate the fodder base of livestock farming, and stipulate the expansion of the work of applying correct grassland crop rotation in collective farms and state farms. The application of crop rotation must ensure the increase in the production of grain, cotton, sugar beets, flax fiber, other crops, and livestock feed according to the state plan every year. It is necessary to increase the use of mineral fertilizers and organic fertilizers in the fields of collective farms and state farms.

The task of increasing the yield and total output of crops puts forward the following requirements for scientific research institutions, seed testing stations, and agricultural departments: in production, it is necessary to adopt new varieties of grain with higher yields, new varieties of cotton with higher yields and earlier maturity, new varieties of sugar beets with higher sugar content, and new varieties of sunflowers with higher oil content. It is necessary to ensure the further development of Soviet agronomy based on the teachings of Michurin and widely adopt the achievements of science and advanced experience in agriculture in collective farms and state farms.

In the Fifth Five-Year Plan, it is stipulated to widely carry out water conservancy projects. During the five-year period, the area of irrigated land will increase by 30% to 35%, and the area of drained land will increase by 40% to 45%. It is stipulated to build approximately 35,000 ponds and reservoirs in collective farms and state farms.

The work of transitioning from temporary irrigation canals to new irrigation systems by replacing permanent irrigation canals is an important means of expanding the area of paddy fields and increasing the yield of paddy fields. It is stipulated that by the end of the five-year plan, all paddy field agricultural regions will completely transition to new irrigation systems.

The primary task in irrigation is to build irrigation and water supply systems based on the power of the Kuybyshev hydroelectric power plant and to build irrigation and water supply systems in the Volga-Don Canal region. It is planned to start the construction of irrigation and water supply systems in the Stalingrad hydroelectric power plant, the Turkmen Main Canal, the South Ukrainian Canal, and the North Crimean Canal. At the same time, it is stipulated to carry out the preparatory work for the construction of irrigation systems for the irrigation of the Kulunda steppes. In the central black soil regions, in the Kura-Araks lowlands, in the Syr Darya, Serafshan, and Kashka river basins, in the middle Fergana, Kuban-Igolsky water system, Orto-Tokoi reservoir, and Chu River Main Canal regions, the construction of irrigation systems will continue. It is necessary to ensure these works with a strong technical foundation. Now, agriculture has a considerable number of excavators. The total number of excavators in agriculture in 1951 is approximately eight times that in 1940. Now, the water conservancy construction industry is equipped with a large number of bulldozers, road graders, and other machinery.

A vast network of irrigation systems, combined with protective forest belts, correct crop rotation, and other advanced agricultural methods, will lay the foundation for the great development of agriculture in vast regions of our country, because in these regions, due to the lack of water and frequent droughts, the harvest of crops has been unstable until recently, and livestock farming has suffered from a lack of water and feed. Given that the area of paddy fields will increase as stipulated, and the state will invest a large amount of funds in the irrigation of these paddy fields, it is necessary to require agricultural workers to improve the utilization of irrigated land. We are not yet satisfied with the utilization of land with an irrigation network, especially in the Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic, the Turkmen Soviet Socialist Republic, and the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic. It is necessary to rectify the use of these lands, take measures to ensure that irrigated lands have a high crop yield, and prevent these lands from becoming salinized and marshy. The Fifth Five-Year Plan stipulates that in the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic, the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic (especially in the Polessye lowlands), the Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic, the Latvian Soviet Socialist Republic, the Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic, the Karelian-Finnish Soviet Socialist Republic, the non-black soil regions of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, and the Barabinsk steppes, it is necessary to greatly expand the drainage work in marshy areas.

Efforts will continue to develop the highly productive public livestock farming in collective farms and state farms, which remains the focus of attention of party and Soviet organizations in the new five-year plan. It is stipulated that during the five-year period, the total number of cattle in agriculture will increase by 18% to 20%, of which the number of cattle in collective farms will increase by 36% to 38%, and the number of cows will increase by approximately two times; the total number of sheep in agriculture will increase by 60% to 62%, of which the number of sheep in collective farms will increase by 75% to 80%; the total number of pigs in agriculture will increase by 45% to 50%, of which the number of pigs in collective farms will increase by 85% to 90%.

It is necessary to greatly improve the productivity of livestock products. The directives stipulate:

In the non-black soil regions, the milk yield per cow in collective farms should reach 1,800 to 2,000 kilograms, in the central black soil regions it should reach 1,700 to 2,000 kilograms, in the southern and Volga regions it should reach 1,600 to 1,900 kilograms, in Siberia, the Urals, and the northeastern regions of Kazakhstan it should reach 1,500 to 1,700 kilograms, in Central Asia it should reach 700 to 900 kilograms, and in the southern Caucasus regions it should reach 900 to 1,100 kilograms.

The shearing amount per fine-wool sheep in collective farms in the southern and northern Caucasus regions should be increased to 5.2 to 5.8 kilograms, and the shearing amount per semi-fine-wool sheep should be increased to 4.2 to 4.8 kilograms; in the central black soil regions, the shearing amount per fine-wool sheep in collective farms should be increased to 4.2 to 5 kilograms, and the shearing amount per semi-fine-wool sheep should be increased to 4 to 4.2 kilograms; in the Volga region, the shearing amount per fine-wool sheep should be increased to 4.6 to 5.4 kilograms, and the shearing amount per semi-fine-wool sheep should be increased to 3.9 to 4.5 kilograms; in Siberia, the shearing amount per fine-wool sheep should be increased to 4.3 to 4.9 kilograms, and the shearing amount per semi-fine-wool sheep should be increased to 3.8 to 4.2 kilograms.

To complete the tasks of livestock farming, it is necessary to universally ensure correct livestock farming methods. During the five-year period, the sowing of fodder crops will increase by approximately 70%, and the yield per unit area of pasture, hay, and root crops for fodder will increase by at least two times.

In the development of dairy farming, it is necessary to pay special attention to the further implementation of a more complete livestock farming system—stall feeding, while considering the characteristics of each region. For our agriculture, especially in regions where a lot of virgin land has been opened up, the transition to stall livestock farming is very urgent and can greatly improve the productivity of dairy farming. We have sufficient possibilities to solve this most important task of livestock farming by widely planting pasture, root crops for fodder, hay, and other crops, and applying crop rotation in pastures and meadows with low productivity to ensure that livestock can be fed with fresh and juicy fodder throughout the year.

The sheep farming industry will have a broad base for development, especially in the regions along the Volga-Don Canal, the Caspian lowlands, the Nogai steppes, and the Turkmen Main Canal. It is necessary to establish a solid base for grazing large and the largest flocks of sheep in these regions.

Page: 1

In the new five-year plan, it is believed that agricultural machine stations are now responsible for more than two-thirds of the collective farms' entire field work, and these large state-owned enterprises face significant tasks. It is necessary to ensure the further improvement of the work of agricultural machine stations, to expand their activities in mechanizing labor-intensive work in various production sectors of collective farms, and to increase the responsibility of agricultural machine stations for fulfilling the plans to increase the yield per unit area of crops and the productivity of livestock products. During this five-year plan period, the mechanization of field work in collective farms must be completed. Mechanization should be widely implemented in livestock farming, vegetable farming, and orchard farming, as well as in the transportation, loading, and unloading of agricultural products, irrigation projects, swamp drainage projects, and the development of new regions. During the five-year period, under the condition of a significant increase in tractors for plowing, the total working capacity of all tractors in agricultural machine stations should be increased by about 1.5 times. By 1955, the working capacity of tractors working on every 100 hectares of sown area in collective farms will be 70% higher than in 1940 and 30% higher than in 1950. In addition, the total number of trucks, stationary engines, and other machinery in agriculture will also increase. It is stipulated to provide agriculture with a large number of new and improved plows, cultivators, sowing machines, cotton pickers, beet harvesters, grass mowers, silage equipment, electric shearing machines, electric milking machines, and other agricultural machinery. The task of agricultural machine stations, state farms, and collective farms is to greatly improve the use of this technology.

During the fifth five-year plan period, it is necessary to expand the use of electricity in agriculture. One of the most important tasks is to manufacture advanced machinery and use electric tractors and other agricultural machinery powered by cheap electricity in agriculture, especially in regions with large hydroelectric power stations.

To fulfill the tasks of the five-year plan in further developing agriculture and livestock farming, it is necessary to further strengthen agricultural labor cooperatives, correctly select and allocate the leadership of collective farms, and improve the work skills of these cadres. It is necessary to ensure the development of public economy, the correct coordination of various sectors of agriculture and livestock farming, the significant increase in labor productivity, the improvement of labor organization and remuneration, the reduction of losses in agriculture, and thus the increase in the wealth of collective farms. The increase in the income of collective farms and the increase in indivisible funds will make it possible to widely carry out construction in collective farms, using basic investments primarily for the development of public economy—building farm buildings and livestock buildings, irrigation and drainage canals, reservoirs, clearing shrubs, planting protective forest belts, building collective farm power stations, and other buildings.

In the construction of state farms, the most important task is to increase the supply of products to the market—first of all, wheat, high-quality and medium-quality wool, meat—and to ensure the supply of purebred livestock to the livestock farming of collective farms. It is necessary to stipulate a significant increase in the yield per unit area of crops and the productivity of livestock products in state farms, and on this basis, significantly reduce the cost of products.

To improve the work of state farms, it is necessary to complete the mechanization of all labor-intensive work in land cultivation, livestock farming, forage harvesting, and forage preparation. Measures must be taken to further strengthen state farms, ensure that state farms have sufficient expert cadres and permanent workers, and turn all state farms into enterprises with high productivity and high commodity output in agriculture.

During the fifth five-year plan period, the state will invest a large amount of funds in agriculture: the total amount of state basic investments will be approximately 2.1 times that of the fourth five-year plan period, and in water conservancy construction, it will be approximately 4 times.

The enormous tasks facing agriculture in the new five-year plan require the Ministry of Agriculture, local party organizations, and Soviet organizations to greatly improve the leadership of agriculture. It is necessary to rely on the state's significant assistance to agriculture, to widely use the huge reserves created by the increase in the total output and commodity output of agriculture and livestock farming, so that every collective farm, state farm, and agricultural machine station can fulfill the state's plan.

Three, the tasks of the five-year plan in commodity circulation, transportation, and postal services

The fifth five-year plan directives stipulate that, based on the increase in industrial and agricultural production, the retail turnover of state and cooperative trade will be approximately increased by 70% during the five-year period.

It is stipulated to significantly increase the sale of the most important food and industrial products, as well as cultural and household items to residents. For example, by 1955, compared to 1950, the sale of meat products to residents will be approximately increased by 90%, fish products by 70%, animal fats by 70%, cheese by 2 times, and sugar by 2 times. It is also stipulated to significantly increase the sale of industrial products: cotton, wool, silk, and hemp textiles by 70%, clothing by 80%, footwear by 80%, knitted goods by 2.2 times. The sale of cultural items should be increased as follows: furniture by 3 times, metal tableware by 2.5 times, sewing machines by 2.4 times, bicycles by 3.5 times, radios and televisions by 2 times, clocks by 2.2 times, household refrigerators, washing machines, and vacuum cleaners by several times. At the same time, it is stipulated to expand the network of canteens, restaurants, and teahouses, to increase the food production of public catering enterprises by approximately 80%, and to significantly increase the variety of food.

To further improve services to consumers, it is stipulated to expand the retail trade network, first of all, to expand the network of specialized stores selling food, clothing, footwear, textiles, furniture, tableware, household items, cultural items, and building materials, and to equip food stores, canteens, restaurants, and warehouses with refrigerators and the latest equipment.

The growth of industrial and agricultural production and the increase in commodity turnover stipulated in the new five-year plan all require a significant development of the transportation industry. During the five-year period, the freight volume of various types of transportation should be approximately increased by 46%. Among them, the freight volume of railways will be increased by 35% to 40%, the freight volume of inland waterways by 75% to 80%, the freight volume of maritime transportation by 55% to 60%, the freight volume of automobile transportation by 80% to 85%, and the freight volume of aviation by at least 2 times, and the transportation volume of oil pipelines by approximately 5 times.

The increase in railway freight volume is a condition for further increasing the intensity of railway freight transportation. Therefore, the most important task in railway transportation is to increase the carrying capacity of railways.

To increase the carrying capacity of railways, a series of major measures are stipulated. These include:

Compared to the previous five-year plan, the use of double tracks will be approximately increased by 60%, electric railways by 4 times, and the length of branch lines to 46% of the length of the main railway lines.

Significantly increase the construction of new railways. During the fifth five-year plan period, the new railways put into operation should be approximately 2.5 times that of the fourth five-year plan period. The construction of the southern section of the Trans-Siberian Railway from Abakan to Aktyubinsk and the Charyo-Kungur railway will be completed; the construction of the following railways will be started: Kungur-Makat, Krasnoyarsk-Yeniseysk, Agreyz-Proninno-Surgut, Guriev-Astrakhan, and others. It is stipulated to continue to supply the main railway lines with various modern signaling equipment, automatic devices, and block systems to ensure the increase in carrying capacity and the safety of train operations.

To strengthen the management of railway lines, it is stipulated to supply railways with new rails, which should be increased by 85% compared to the fourth five-year plan, and the length of railways with ballast should be increased by 2 times. During this five-year plan period, it is necessary to equip most of the existing wagons with automatic couplers and begin to equip vehicles with roller bearings. Industry should fully supply railway transportation with various locomotives and wagons, and begin to manufacture new powerful traction locomotives, electric locomotives, diesel locomotives, including gas locomotives.

One of the most important tasks of the Ministry of Railways is to make every effort to improve the use of vehicles, especially to shorten the turnover time of wagons, increase the average daily mileage of locomotives, and ensure a significant improvement in the use of the cargo-carrying capacity of vehicles, and increase the load of freight trains. The implementation of the tasks stipulated in the transportation sector requires all links of railway transportation, based on the government's decision to strengthen labor discipline and improve the organization of labor of workers related to train operations, especially locomotive crews, to make work accurate and coordinated.

During this five-year plan period, with the opening of the Lenin Volga-Don Canal, the potential of inland waterway transportation has been significantly increased. In addition, during the fifth five-year plan period, the reconstruction of the Volga-Baltic Waterway will be carried out, and the depth of navigation on the Kama River will be increased. The completion of the giant water conservancy projects of the Stalin White Sea-Baltic Canal, the Moscow Canal, the Lenin Volga-Don Canal, and the stipulated reconstruction of the Volga-Baltic Waterway and the construction of hydroelectric power stations on the Volga and Kama Rivers will make it possible to basically establish a single deep-water transportation system in the European part of the Soviet Union during the fifth five-year plan period. The primary task of the Ministry of Inland Waterways is to fully utilize this transportation system to transport a large number of passengers and goods.

Due to the significant increase in inland waterway freight and the completion of new waterways, it is stipulated to build passenger and cargo ships that can navigate in large reservoirs, diesel-powered ships, tugboats, and barges; it is necessary to build new ports, reconstruct existing ports, and equip all ports with highly efficient mechanized tools, thereby approximately doubling the throughput of inland ports.

It is necessary to eliminate the backwardness of inland waterway transportation in the river basins of Siberia, increase the role of inland waterway transportation in the transportation of goods in the Far North, and at the same time, develop small river navigation to meet local needs.

To significantly increase the tonnage of ocean-going merchant ships, including oil tankers, it is stipulated to build new shipyards and ship repair yards and expand existing shipyards and ship repair yards to expand the domestic construction of ocean-going ships. During the five-year period, the throughput of seaports and the capacity of ship repair yards should be approximately doubled. It is stipulated to expand and reconstruct the seaports of Leningrad, Odessa, Zhdanov, Novorossiysk, Makhachkala, Murmansk, Narva-Mar, and the Far East, and expand the ports of Riga and Klaipeda.

It is stipulated to increase the cargo volume of the Northern Sea Route to ensure uninterrupted supply to the residents, enterprises, and construction sites of the Arctic and Far North, to replenish ocean-going ships with new icebreakers, and to widely develop cargo transportation in the Yenisei River basin.

The length of hard-surfaced automobile roads should be increased by approximately 50% compared to the fourth five-year plan, especially in the southern regions, Transcaucasia, and the Baltic coast.

It is necessary to pay close attention to improving the use of the rapidly increasing number of automobiles and reducing the cost of automobile transportation. For this purpose, it is stipulated to significantly increase the share of public bus transportation in freight and passenger transportation, to complete the consolidation of existing and the establishment of new regional economic accounting automobile systems. Expand the network of automobile repair shops and automobile technical service stations. The length of fixed bus routes between cities should be approximately doubled. Public buses should be established in all large cities.

Significantly expand the aviation network, increase the total number of transport aircraft equipped with the latest flight instruments, and increase the number of airports with day and night navigation equipment.

In the field of postal and telecommunications, it is stipulated to strengthen telephone and telegraph communications between cities, as well as radio communications. Significantly increase the broadcasting capacity of radio stations to improve the conditions for listening to Soviet broadcasts throughout the Soviet Union and in various countries around the world. Develop the work of ultra-shortwave broadcasting and radio relay communications. The working capacity of city telephone exchanges should be increased by 30% to 35%.

Based on the plan to further develop the transportation and postal industries, during the fifth five-year plan period, the state's basic investments in the transportation and postal industries should be approximately increased by 63% compared to the fourth five-year plan period.

Four, the tasks of the fifth five-year plan in further improving the material well-being of the people, health care, and cultural level

The stipulated growth of socialist production and labor productivity ensures a significant increase in national income and further improvement of the material well-being of the people. During the five-year period, the national income of the Soviet Union should be increased by at least 60%, which will ensure a further significant increase in the income of workers and employees, and farmers.

Based on the increase in production and labor productivity, and based on the tasks of cultural construction, it is stipulated that by 1955, the number of workers and employees in the national economy sectors should be approximately increased by 15% compared to 1950.

During the new five-year plan period, the retail prices of daily necessities will be further reduced. The continuous reduction of prices is the main means of systematically increasing the real wages of workers and employees and increasing the income of farmers.

During the five-year period, the real wages of workers and employees should be increased by at least 35% (including the reduction of retail prices). The state's allocation for social insurance of workers and employees should be approximately increased by 30% compared to 1950.

The increase in labor productivity of collective farm members, the growth of collective farm production, and the increase in agricultural and livestock production will ensure that the cash and in-kind income of collective farm members will be increased by at least 40% (in cash terms).

To further improve the living conditions of workers and employees, during the fifth five-year plan period, it is necessary to complete the plan for large-scale housing construction. Therefore, the basic investments in housing construction in cities and workers' residential areas should be approximately doubled compared to the previous five-year plan. The state construction system alone will build new housing in cities and workers' residential areas with an area of 105 million square meters. In addition, private housing construction will be carried out, with residents using state loans or their own savings to build. It should be noted that during the previous five-year plan period, a large-scale restoration of destroyed housing was carried out, while during this five-year plan period, only higher-quality and better-equipped new housing will be built.

In addition to completing the plan for large-scale housing construction, extensive measures will be taken to further improve the public facilities for residents and various facilities to improve the convenience of residents' lives—expanding water supply and sewerage, increasing the supply of heat and gas to housing, expanding urban transportation, and improving the facilities of cities and workers' residential areas.

During the fifth five-year plan period, it is necessary to complete the serious tasks in the field of national health. It is stipulated to further expand the network of hospitals, clinics, maternity hospitals, sanatoriums, nurseries, and kindergartens. The number of hospital beds should be increased by at least 20%, the number of sanatorium beds by approximately 15%, the number of rest home beds by approximately 30%, the number of nursery beds by approximately 20%, and the number of kindergarten beds by approximately 40%. It is necessary to ensure the further supply of hospitals, clinics, and sanatoriums with the latest medical equipment and improve their working level. The number of doctors in the country should be increased by at least 25% during the five-year period, and the facilities for doctors' advanced training should be expanded.

The production of medicines, medical equipment, and instruments should be increased by at least 2.5 times, especially the production of the latest medicines and medical preventive agents, as well as modern diagnostic and treatment equipment.

It is necessary to ensure the further development of sports.

In addition to improving the material well-being of the working people, it is necessary to ensure the further rise of socialist culture. We put forward this task: by the end of the five-year plan, in the capital cities of the republics, republics directly under the jurisdiction of the republics, regional and territorial centers, as well as large industrial centers, to completely change the seven-year education to universal secondary education (ten-year education), and to prepare for the complete implementation of universal secondary education (ten-year education) in other cities and rural areas during the next five-year plan period. Therefore, the number of students in grades 8 to 10 in urban schools should be increased to 4 times that of 1950 by 1955, and the number of students in grades 8 to 10 in rural secondary schools should be increased to 4.5 times.

To smoothly complete the major and to a large extent new tasks in education, it is necessary to expand the work of training teachers and improve the work of national education institutions. It is stipulated to increase the establishment of schools in cities and rural areas by approximately 70% compared to the previous five-year plan.

To further enhance the socialist educational significance of general schools, to ensure that graduates of secondary schools have the conditions to freely choose their professions, it is stipulated to start implementing comprehensive technical education in secondary schools and to take measures necessary for the transition to universal comprehensive technical education.

Based on the tasks of further developing the national economy and cultural construction, during the five-year period, the number of various specialists trained by higher and secondary specialized schools should be increased by 30% to 35%, of which more than 50% should be trained by higher schools. The number of specialists trained by higher schools in 1955 for the most important industries, construction, and agriculture should be approximately doubled compared to 1950.

Science, which plays an important role in the progress of Soviet technology and the improvement of socialist culture, will receive significant support from the state during the new five-year plan period. The number of scientific researchers and scientific and educational researchers trained through higher schools and research institutions of scientific research institutions will be approximately doubled compared to the previous five-year plan. It is stipulated to use a large amount of basic investments for the construction of scientific research institutes and higher schools. The construction of the largest scientific and academic center—the building of the Moscow State University—has been completed.

Scientific research institutes and higher schools should significantly improve scientific work, make more use of scientific workers to solve the most important problems in the development of the national economy, and summarize advanced experience. It is necessary to ensure the wide and practical application of scientific inventions, to help scientists solve theoretical problems in various fields of knowledge, and to strengthen the connection between science and production.

Given the increasing desire of adult residents to improve their education, it is stipulated to further develop correspondence and evening higher and secondary specialized schools, and to develop general schools that allow working citizens to receive education without leaving production. It is stipulated to widely implement measures to further improve the skills of production workers.

To better meet the growing needs of the national economy for skilled cadres, especially due to the further adoption of advanced experience in production, it is stipulated to improve the efficiency of training young skilled workers in the state labor reserve system and to improve the efficiency of training workers in production.

To better meet the growing cultural needs of the residents, during the fifth five-year plan period, it is necessary to ensure the further development of the film and television industry, libraries, clubs, newspapers, and periodicals. It is necessary to expand the network of cinemas, increase the number of film projection equipment by approximately 25% during the five-year period, and increase the production of films, especially color films. During the five-year period, the network of public libraries should be expanded by at least 30%, and the network of clubs by 15%; at the same time, it is necessary to improve their service to residents. It is stipulated to significantly increase the publication of literary works and scientific works, textbooks, magazines, and newspapers, expand the publishing and printing industry, and improve the printing and binding quality of books.

According to the development of health care, education, science, and cultural education institutions, during the five-year period, the total amount of state basic investments in these areas should be approximately increased by 50% compared to the previous five-year plan.

× × ×

These are the extremely important tasks of the new five-year plan in the national economy and the improvement of the material and cultural living standards of the working people. These tasks prove that the development of the Soviet economy is indeed progressing rapidly. Everyone knows that the first three five-year plans, or more precisely, the thirteen years of peaceful construction before the Great Patriotic War, were a period of enormous production growth in terms of scale. When Comrade Stalin explained the characteristics of this period, he pointed out: "Such an unprecedented growth in production cannot be considered a simple and ordinary development of the state from backwardness to progress. This is a leap that turned our Motherland from a backward country into an advanced country, from an agricultural country into an industrial country." Now, the Soviet Union still has enormous potential for expanding socialist production. If we compare the tasks of the new five-year plan in developing production with the actual summary of the development of the national economy during the first three five-year plan periods (thirteen years), we can see: the fifth five-year plan is equal to the total amount of the increase in production of many extremely important products during the pre-war three five-year plans, and for some products, it even exceeds this total amount. For example, the increase in the production of rolled steel, oil, electricity, cotton textiles, and other extremely important products stipulated in the fifth five-year plan all significantly exceed the increase in the production of these products during the pre-war three five-year plan periods—from 1927-1928 to 1940.

The new five-year plan ensures the further rise of the economy and culture of each union republic. The fifth five-year plan once again brilliantly demonstrates that the friendship between the peoples of the Soviet Union is becoming increasingly strong, and they are jointly striving for a common goal—to build a communist society and strengthen the economic power that is the solid foundation for the prosperity and strength of the Soviet Union, our Motherland, of all peoples.

The tasks of developing the economy and culture of the Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic, Latvian Soviet Socialist Republic, and Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic in the fifth five-year plan are also a concrete example of the extreme attention of the Soviet government to the needs of each union republic. Even in the summary of the fourth five-year plan, the industrial output of the Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic, Latvian Soviet Socialist Republic, and Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic was 2.8 times that of 1940, and in the fifth five-year plan period, it will be further significantly increased. During the new five-year plan period, these republics will further industrialize. Therefore, it is stipulated to increase the generation of electricity by 2 to 2.5 times, to build the Narva hydroelectric power station, the Riga thermal power station, and to start the construction of the Kaunas hydroelectric power station. It is necessary to carry out the survey and design work for the construction of hydroelectric power stations on the Baltic coast. Based on the development of the shale chemical industry, it is ensured that the production of artificial gas in the Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic will be increased by 2 to 2.5 times, and the production of liquid fuel will be increased by 80%, and the construction and use of the gas pipeline from Kotla-Jarve to Tallinn will be completed. It is stipulated to further develop the machinery industry: the shipbuilding industry, turbine manufacturing, electrical machinery manufacturing, and machine tool manufacturing of the Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic; the electrical machinery manufacturing, machine tool manufacturing, and shipbuilding industry of the Latvian Soviet Socialist Republic; the shipbuilding industry and electrical machinery manufacturing of the Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic. In the Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic, the production of superphosphate will be organized, and the construction of a superphosphate plant will begin in the Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic. It is stipulated that during the five-year period, the fishing volume of the Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic will be approximately increased by 3.9 times, the fishing volume of the Latvian Soviet Socialist Republic will be approximately increased by 80%, and the fishing volume of the Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic will be approximately increased by 85%, and it is stipulated to expand the existing fish processing enterprises in these republics and establish new fish processing enterprises.

It is stipulated to further develop the highly productive livestock farming, especially dairy farming and pig farming, in the Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic, Latvian Soviet Socialist Republic, and Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic. Drainage work will be carried out in the swamp areas of these republics. The network of agricultural machine stations equipped with tractors and agricultural machinery will be expanded.

It is necessary to carry out the necessary work to transform the railways, while improving the navigation of the Nemunas and Daugava river basins and increasing the passenger and cargo transportation volume. It is stipulated to build a bridge across the Nemunas River in Kaunas and a bridge across the Daugava River in Riga. It is ensured to further develop the maritime transportation of the Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic, Latvian Soviet Socialist Republic, and Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic, and to expand their seaports. It is stipulated to carry out large-scale construction and reconstruction of automobile roads.

It is necessary to take major measures to develop health care and culture. During the five-year period, the number of hospital beds in the Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic will be approximately increased by 40%, the number of hospital beds in the Latvian Soviet Socialist Republic will be approximately increased by 30%, and the number of hospital beds in the Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic will be approximately increased by 30%.

It is stipulated that the number of students enrolled in teacher training colleges in the Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic will be increased by 2.3 times, the number of students enrolled in teacher training colleges in the Latvian Soviet Socialist Republic will be increased by 90%, and the number of students enrolled in teacher training colleges in the Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic will be increased by 60%.

Similarly, major tasks have been stipulated for the development of the economy and culture of other union republics.

The implementation of the new five-year plan cannot be carried out spontaneously; it requires workers, peasants, and intellectuals to make serious efforts and to work actively and creatively. The implementation of the new five-year plan requires the completion of a huge basic construction plan. Basic construction in our country has always been and remains the basic means of solving the most important economic tasks put forward by the Communist Party, and is an extremely important factor in determining the speed and direction of the development of various sectors of the national economy.

During 1951-1955, the total amount of state basic investments in basic construction is stipulated to be approximately increased by 90% compared to the fourth five-year plan, and the state's allocation for basic construction will be increased by 60%. The amount by which the total amount of basic construction investments exceeds the amount of allocations should be compensated by appropriately reducing construction costs through methods such as increasing labor productivity, reducing operating expenses, and lowering the prices of building materials and equipment.

To complete the stipulated basic construction plan, it is necessary to mobilize the internal resources and accumulated sources of the national economy.

The smooth solution of this task depends on the completion of the tasks of increasing labor productivity and reducing production and circulation costs, and on the ability to manage, ensuring the implementation of true economy in every economic construction sector.

The main source of the growth of socialist production, the reduction of costs, and the expansion of accumulation is the increase in labor productivity. During the five-year period, labor productivity in industry should be approximately increased by 50%, in construction by approximately 55%, and in agriculture by approximately 40%. During the fifth five-year plan period, approximately three-quarters of the total increase in industrial production will be achieved through the increase in labor productivity. In this way, the increase in industrial production will be mainly achieved through the increase in labor productivity.

The continuous increase in the proportion of labor technology equipment, the adoption of advanced science and technology in production, and the further improvement of the material conditions of the people and the improvement of the cultural and technical level of the working people are the basis for this increase in labor productivity.

During the fifth five-year plan period, the mechanization of heavy and labor-intensive work will be basically completed, and by 1955, the electricity used in the labor of industrial workers will be 70% higher than in 1950 and 2.6 times higher than in 1940. The extensive mechanization and electrification of socialist production will have particularly favorable conditions. In the Soviet Union, where there is no unemployment, machines, in addition to saving labor for society, also reduce the labor of workers.

The widespread promotion of the best practices of enterprises and production innovators in the use of technology, the improvement of technological processes, and the adoption of advanced production organization methods is of great significance for achieving high labor productivity. It is necessary to launch a mass movement of inventions and rationalization proposals among engineers, technicians, workers, and collective farm members to improve production methods, increase labor productivity, and reduce production costs. The systematic reduction of product costs and industrial product sales prices is the correct path for the development of socialist industry. The reduction of product costs most clearly reflects the quality of industrial work, the achievements of industry in improving production technology, increasing labor productivity, and strengthening economic accounting. The reduction of product costs and circulation costs is the basis for further reducing retail and wholesale prices.

It is stipulated that during the five-year period, industrial product costs should be approximately reduced by 25%, construction project costs should be approximately reduced by at least 20%, the working costs of tractors in agricultural machine stations should be approximately reduced by 25%, railway transportation costs should be approximately reduced by 15%, and retail trade circulation costs should be approximately reduced by 23%. At the same time, it is necessary to significantly reduce the costs of procurement, storage, and sales of agricultural products, as well as the operating expenses of industrial sales departments.

To complete the tasks of the five-year plan in reducing production and circulation costs, in addition to increasing labor productivity, it is necessary to implement the strictest economy of material resources, and the methods are to eliminate the waste of materials and equipment, strengthen the struggle against waste, adopt various economical materials, and widely use substitutes with the same value and advanced production technology. At the same time, it is necessary to make serious efforts to streamline the management organizations of enterprises and institutions.

Particular attention should be paid to reducing construction costs. Although the total amount of basic construction investments has increased significantly, construction projects have been equipped with advanced technology, the cost of construction is still high. It is necessary to strive to save the state a large amount of funds every year for the construction of factories, roads, housing, hospitals, and schools.

The stipulated reduction in construction project costs should be achieved through methods such as further mechanization of construction labor, the adoption of industrial methods in construction, the shortening of construction periods, the improvement of project quality, the reduction of operating expenses, and the reduction of building material prices.

It is required that the economic leaders of enterprises and construction projects pay more attention to the economic and financial issues of production, and that they are able to combine all their activities in the development of technology and the organization of production with the economic achievements of the enterprise. It is necessary to strengthen the financial organs to constantly control the production and construction processes, commodity circulation, the accumulation of valuable materials, and the economic activities of enterprises and economic institutions with rubles.

Comrade Stalin said: "It is unfortunate that our economic workers and planning workers, with a few exceptions, know very little about the role of the law of value, do not study this role, and are not good at considering this role in their own accounting."

The Party, Soviet, economic, trade union, and Komsomol organizations at all levels must mobilize the broad masses of working people to complete and overfulfill the five-year plan, and carry out extensive Bolshevik-style criticism and self-criticism of the shortcomings in our organization's work to quickly eliminate these shortcomings and improve our entire work. We must educate our cadres with a spirit of intolerance towards any shortcomings, waste, and bureaucratism in the organization of production, and must promptly point out and support the new, advanced, and progressive phenomena in economic life.

It is necessary to ensure strict state discipline in the completion of the national economic plan, while taking the following instructions of the Party and the government as a guide: the completion of the state plan is the absolute duty of every enterprise. Not only should the state plan be completed in terms of the total output, but also in terms of the variety, quality, and labor productivity of products, and the cost of products.

The implementation of the tasks put forward by the new five-year plan requires the improvement of the national economic planning work. The most important task of planning work is to ensure the correct proportion of the development of various sectors of industry and the national economy, to reveal and utilize the internal potential for the growth of production.

The smooth completion of the fifth five-year plan will make it possible to significantly increase the potential. The directives of the five-year plan stipulate that during the five-year period, the reserves of state materials and grain should be doubled to ensure that the state is not affected by any unexpected events.

Comrades! The completion of the new five-year plan will be a major step forward on the road from socialism to communism.

The five-year plans of Comrade Stalin have always had great international significance. When Comrade Stalin explained the summary of the first five-year plan, he pointed out: "On the road of economic construction in our country, probably no step has encountered such a deep reaction in the various classes of capitalist countries in Europe, America, and Asia as the five-year plan and its development and implementation."

Our five-year plans show the world: socialism has great vitality, and the socialist economic system has fundamental advantages over the capitalist economic system. The new five-year plan stipulates the significant development of the production of various sectors of the national economy and their technological progress, the further improvement of the material well-being and cultural level of the Soviet people; the new five-year plan clearly reflects the requirements of the basic law of socialist economy and the law of planned development of the national economy. The main characteristics and requirements of the basic law of socialist economy, as Comrade Stalin taught us, are to ensure the maximum satisfaction of the constantly growing material and cultural needs of the whole society through the continuous growth and improvement of socialist production based on high technology.

The five-year plans of the Soviet Union—these are plans for peaceful economic and cultural construction. The completion of this plan will make a new and significant contribution to the consolidation of world peace. The peaceful policy of the Soviet government embodied in the new five-year plan is based on the point that socialism and capitalism can coexist peacefully, reflecting the unshakable belief of the entire Soviet people in peace, and fully in line with the fundamental interests of the working people of all countries.

The new five-year plan will help to further consolidate and expand the economic cooperation and fraternal unity between the Soviet Union and various people's democratic countries, and to develop economic relations with all countries willing to develop trade on the basis of equality and mutual benefit.

The new five-year plan has enhanced the international prestige of the Soviet Union. Millions of people around the world are increasingly convinced of the superiority of the socialist system and the superiority of the Soviet Union's policy of peace and the development of friendly relations with the peoples of various countries.

The publication of the draft directives of the fifth five-year plan at the Nineteenth Party Congress has aroused great interest and enthusiastic response in all countries. The working people of the world enthusiastically welcome the new Stalin five-year plan aimed at peaceful economic construction and the further improvement of the material well-being of the people.

In the Soviet Union, the draft directives of the fifth five-year plan have received universal approval from party organizations at all levels, the working class, peasants, and intellectuals. Under the inspiration of the plan for the rapid development of socialist economy and culture towards communism, the Soviet working people have welcomed the Party Congress with outstanding production achievements. In the nine months of 1952, compared to the same period last year, the total industrial output of the Soviet Union increased by 12.5%, the total amount of basic investments in the national economy increased by 15%, and the average daily transportation volume of railways increased by 10%. The grain harvest has been good, and the harvest of technical crops, vegetables, and potatoes is about to be completed.

Party organizations at all levels, as well as individual party members and non-party comrades, have put forward many opinions and supplements when discussing the draft directives of the five-year plan. The opinions put forward are mostly based on the tasks and characteristics of the economic development of this or that province, territory, or republic, or are adapted to individual sectors of the national economy, and make the directives more specific.

Some people suggest increasing the production of this or that industrial sector, making the tasks of developing agriculture and transportation more specific, and building industrial enterprises, power stations, railways, and highways needed by certain provinces, territories, or republics.

For example, comrades from Ukraine have raised the issue of building a coal selection plant and a thermal power station in Zaporozhye; comrades from Leningrad have proposed building a hydroelectric power station; some people have suggested building new power transmission lines and substations in Krivoi Rog, and building a hydroelectric power station on the Daugava River, and so on.

There are many proposals to make the tasks of adopting new technologies and mechanizing heavy labor more specific. There are many suggestions to improve labor organization, train cadres, and improve the work of cultural institutions, scientific institutions, and health institutions.

All the above proposals are full of concern for the completion and overfulfillment of the fifth five-year plan, reflecting the rich experience accumulated by party organizations at all levels in economic construction, reflecting the growth of our cadres, and are of great significance to the five-year plan.

Since the directives of the five-year plan should only stipulate the basic tasks of the national economy and cannot make detailed stipulations, all the proposals to make the draft directives more specific by party organizations at all levels, individual party members, and non-party comrades will be appropriately studied and adopted when we formulate the five-year plan based on the directives of the Nineteenth Party Congress.

However, some revisions should be made when finalizing the draft directives. For example, in the industrial sector, it is appropriate to point out the development of automatic machinery in the machinery industry, in the agricultural sector, it is appropriate to point out the development of sericulture and apiculture, in the postal and telecommunications sector, it is appropriate to point out the development of radio broadcasting, and in the labor sector, it is appropriate to point out the implementation of measures to improve labor protection and health conditions.

In various people's democratic countries, the draft directives of the fifth five-year plan have also aroused the political and production enthusiasm of the working people, and strengthened their concern for the economic construction of the Soviet Union. The economic construction of the Soviet Union is an example for the peoples of countries that have taken the road to socialism and democracy. The working people of various new democratic countries are satisfied to accept the five-year plan for the further improvement of the economic strength of the Soviet Union. They regard it as a reliable guarantee for world peace and a realistic premise for further strengthening and expanding the economic ties between the Soviet Union and various people's democratic countries. The workers and peasants of various people's democratic countries, in order to celebrate the Nineteenth Party Congress, have taken on the obligation to complete and overfulfill their own five-year plans.

The plan to further improve the living standards of the people stipulated in the five-year plan has made a deep impression on the impoverished working people of capitalist countries due to the increasing militarization of the capitalist economy. They are more and more convinced every day: only under the socialist system, peaceful labor and the well-being of the whole society are possible.

All bourgeois newspapers have paid great attention to the new five-year plan of the Soviet Union. If bourgeois newspapers have always been skeptical of the previous five-year plans, and many bourgeois activists even thought that the fourth five-year plan could not be completed without American loans, then now, the definite achievements obtained from the completion of the Soviet plan have made the bourgeois public opinion no longer regard this five-year plan as unrealistic. It is interesting to point out that the fifth five-year plan once again brilliantly proves the peaceful policy of the Soviet government, dealing a serious blow to the war provocateurs. Therefore, the reactionary bourgeois newspapers attack the draft directives of the fifth five-year plan with a series of lies and slanders, trying to cover up the peaceful nature of the five-year plan to the people, and falsely claiming that it has aggressive purposes and tasks.

Comrade Stalin has already explained: it is impossible to simultaneously expand civilian industry, carry out large-scale civilian construction, and systematically reduce the prices of daily necessities, while increasing military strength and expanding military industry. The rumors of Soviet aggression are spread to mislead the working people of capitalist countries, to make them believe the lies about the Soviet Union, and to deceive them into a new world war being organized by the reactionary group of the United States. However, the continuous improvement of the material well-being of the Soviet working people and the peaceful development of the national economy and culture, and the deteriorating situation of the working people of capitalist countries and the development of militarism, have exposed the brutal lie propagated by the bourgeoisie.

Comrades! Just like the previous five-year plans, the inspirer of the new five-year plan is our leader and teacher, Comrade Stalin. (Applause)

Before the opening of the Congress, Comrade Stalin's new work "The Economic Problems of Socialism in the Soviet Union" was published, which armed our Party with knowledge of the laws of socialist economy, with the theory of building communism in the Soviet Union, and with the scientific basis of national economic planning.

The Soviet people are welcoming the five-year plan formulated according to the directives of the Party and the government with a new surge of production enthusiasm and a new surge of socialist competition to win the fifth Stalin five-year plan.

The Soviet people will spare no effort to ensure the smooth completion and overfulfillment of the new five-year plan. United closely around the Communist Party, united around our beloved leader and teacher, the great Stalin, the Soviet people are confidently moving towards communism. (Long applause)

    苏联共产党第十九次代表大会关于一九五一——一九五五年苏联发展第五个五年计划的指示
    国家计划委员会主席马·萨·萨布罗夫同志的报告
    编者按：苏联共产党第十九次代表大会关于一九五一——一九五五年苏联发展第五个五年计划的指示草案，在大会召开之前业已公布（草案译文见八月二十三日本报），并列为联共第十九次代表大会的第三项议程。在联共第十九次代表大会上，苏联国家计划委员会主席马·萨·萨布罗夫同志就这个议程做了详细的报告。这个报告，系统地说明了苏联第五个五年计划在各个方面的任务。为了便利大家学习联共第十九次代表大会的重要文件起见，我们根据苏联“真理报”十月十日发表的全文，把它翻译出来在这里发表。
    同志们！
    现在把关于一九五一——一九五五年苏联发展第五个五年计划的指示，提交给你们审查。新五年计划将继续前几个五年计划和平发展苏联经济、不断提高社会主义经济和人民福利的路线。这个计划的实现，将是我国从社会主义逐渐过渡到共产主义的一个重要阶段。
    我国在实现了第四个五年计划的基础上，在经济建设和文化建设方面都得到了巨大的成就。一九四六——一九五○年苏联恢复和发展国民经济的五年计划的基本任务，是恢复我国受到战争灾害的各地区，是恢复工业和农业的战前水平，然后大大超过这个水平。从当时公布的关于第四个五年计划的执行总结的通告可以知道，这个计划是顺利地完成了，而计划中最重要的任务是大大地超额完成了。
    由于第四个五年计划的完成，战前苏联国民经济的发展水平已被大大超过了。就工业产量来说，五年计划是以四年三个月提前完成了，因而一九五○年全部工业总产量比战前高百分之七十三。由于工业高速度的发展，国民经济大规模地完成了进一步的技术武装，国民经济各部门都增添了我国最新式的机器。
    在农业方面，就农作物的单位面积产量和总产量来说，以及就牲畜饲养业产品数量来说，都大大超过了战前水平。
    随着国民经济主要部门的增长，各种运输都得到了发展，而且货运也大大超过了战前水平。
    在国民经济高涨的基础上，劳动人民的福利提高了，国民消费大大超过了战前水平。一九五○年苏联的国民收入，比一九四○年增加了百分之六十四。日用品的生产大大扩大了，货币改革实现了，一切食品和工业品的配给制取消了，贸易广泛地展开了，零售价格几次降低了，苏联卢布更加巩固了。一九五○年工人和职员的收入与农民的收入总额，比一九四○年增加了百分之六十二。
    一九四六——一九五○年苏联恢复和发展国民经济的五年计划，是没有任何外援，没有外国贷款，专靠国内资源来完成的。在完成和超额完成计划方面起决定作用的，是伟大斯大林指导下的共产党所领导的苏联人民的忘我劳动。（鼓掌）第四个五年计划的顺利完成，进一步巩固了社会主义制度，形成了苏联新的巨大胜利，保证了社会主义国家的威力进一步的增长。
    第四个五年计划的顺利完成，使我们能够通过第五个五年计划，以保证国民经济各部门的进一步高涨，劳动人民物质福利的增长，保健事业的发展和人民文化水平的提高。
    现在以下列各项数字，来说明第五个五年计划的指示中最重要的任务。
    一、第五个五年计划在工业方面的任务
    第五个五年计划的指示规定：一九五五年的工业生产水平，比一九五○年大约提高百分之七十。这就是说，到第五个五年计划结束时，工业总产量将为战前的三倍。在五年期间，工业总产量平均每年大约增加百分之十二，其中生产资料生产的增长速度为百分之十三，消费品生产的增长速度为百分之十一。在第四个五年计划期间，工业总产量的增长速度更高些。在第五个五年计划期间，工业品增加速度之所以比第四个五年计划期间稍微低些，一方面是因为工业的恢复工作已经结束，而当时生产的迅速扩大是靠所恢复的企业来达到的；另一方面是因为在新的五年计划期间，必须进一步大大改进产品的质量并扩大其品种。同时应该估计到：在新五年计划期间，总产量每增加百分之一，都几乎相当于第四个五年计划期间所增加的两倍。
    冶炼业是工业和整个国民经济发展的基础。五年计划的指示规定：一九五五年的产量和一九五○年比较起来，铣铁大约增加百分之七十六，钢大约增加百分之六十二，压延金属大约增加百分之六十四。规定压延金属生产在五年期间的增加数量，将超过一九四○年的全年产量。为了更充分地满足建筑业和机器制造业的需要，应当增加各种不足压延金属的生产，如厚钢板、薄钢板、钢丝和不锈钢板，同时应当发展经济适用的各型各类压延金属的生产，增加特种钢和合金的生产并改善其质量。
    上述黑色金属生产增长的最重要条件，是进一步改善对冶炼企业现有生产能力的利用。为此目的，规定进一步加速冶炼过程，加速对冶炼过程控制的自动化，加速冶炼企业中费力劳动的机械化。
    应当实行建设新的黑色金属冶炼企业和扩大现有的黑色金属冶炼企业的巨大计划。在第五个五年计划期间，使用的铣铁生产能力比第四个五年计划应当大约增加百分之三十二，钢的生产能力大约增加百分之四十二，压延金属生产能力至少增加为二倍，焦炭生产能力大约增加百分之八十，铁砂生产能力大约增加为三倍。除了进一步发展南部地区、乌拉尔、西伯利亚、中部地区和西北地区的黑色金属冶炼业以外，还应当保证发展南高加索地区的冶炼业。同时必须在卡列里—芬兰共和国进行铁砂产地的勘察设计工作。
    必须大大扩大有色金属的生产。在五年期间，精制铜的生产大约增加百分之九十，铅的生产大约增加为二点七倍，铝的生产至少增加为二点六倍，锌的生产大约增加为二点五倍，镍的生产大约增加百分之五十三，锡的生产大约增加百分之八十。随着有色金属生产的增加，将进一步改善和采用保证增加上等金属产量的新的技术操作过程。与有色金属生产的任务相配合，应当发展有色金属冶炼业的原料基地，使采矿和费力的劳动尽量机械化，同时大大改进冶炼企业在利用矿砂原料方面的工作。
    实现所规定的国民经济各部门生产增长速度和技术改进速度的最重要条件，是使国家进一步电气化。一九五五年的发电量，比一九五○年大约增加百分之八十。这使我们能够提高工业电气化的水平，广泛展开生产过程的自动化，进一步采用电烘和电分解的新方法，大大扩大农业对电力的使用，实行铁路的进一步电气化，增加发电量以满足居民生活上的需要。
    为了保证所规定的发电量的增长，以及为了增加动力系统的储电量，规定高速度地增加电站的发电能力。在五年期间，使电站的总发电能力大约增加为二倍，水电站的发电能力大约增加为三倍。同时，火力发电站发电能力的增加，首先应当以扩大现有的电站来保证。
    依据政府的决定，在第五个五年计划期间，广泛地建筑水电站和在燃料产地建筑火力发电站。
    正在建筑的水电站中，首先必须提到伏尔加河上的古比雪夫水电站和斯大林格勒水电站，以及德涅泊河上的卡霍夫卡水电站。发电能力二百一十万瓩的古比雪夫水电站将在一九五五年开始发电，这将大大增加中部地区和伏尔加河流域的电力供应。规定架设由古比雪夫水电站到莫斯科的四十万伏特电压的电力输送线。全世界电力工程的实践，尚未有过这样的设备。在第五个五年计划期间，除了古比雪夫水电站以外，应当建成的还有这样一些大水电站，如卡马、高尔基、明基卡乌尔、乌斯特—卡缅诺戈尔斯克等水电站，这些水电站在这个五年期间将开始发电，它们的发电能力将为二百万瓩左右。此外，将建成的还有各区和各地方的水电站。广泛展开斯大林格勒、卡霍夫卡和诺沃西比尔斯克的水电站的建设工作，同时将开始建设新的大水电站：伏尔加河上的契鲍克萨利水电站，卡马河上的沃特金斯克水电站，伊尔提施河上的布克塔马水电站以及其他等等。应当开始成套地利用安加拉河的动力资源的工作，以便在廉价电力和当地原料的基础上发展制铝工业、化学工业、采矿工业及其他工业部门。
    为了认真改善南部地区、乌拉尔和库兹巴斯的电力供应，规定大大增加这些地区的各区和各工厂的火力发电站的发电能力。除了建立巨型的电站以外，还应当建立小型和中型的电站，以改进各城市和各区的电力供应；为了广泛供应城市和工业企业以热力，必须继续建设火力发电站。
    在巨型火力发电站里，照例要装设高压锅炉和透平。在电站中，将广泛采用生产过程自动化。
    在关于第五个五年计划的指示里，规定要进一步大大发展石油工业。在五年期间，石油的开采量将大约增加百分之八十五。为了保证石油开采量上述的增长，必须加强凿井工作，广泛采用新的凿井方法，大规模采用保持石油层压力的方法，基本上完成石油开采过程的自动化。大规模石油开采计划的实行，要求加速炼油工业的发展，并使炼油工业尽量靠近使用石油产品的地区。在五年期间，炼油厂的生产能力将增加如下：初炼厂的生产能力大约增加为二倍，原油精炼厂的生产能力大约增加为二点七倍。同时应当掌握和采用加强精炼的新方法，以保证大大增加轻馏分提取量。应当大大发展以油管运送石油和石油产品。为了发展人造液体燃料的生产，应当使我国东部各区的强大企业开工。
    在第五个五年计划期间，保证进一步广泛发展瓦斯工业。在五年期间，天然瓦斯和石油副产瓦斯以及用煤和页岩制造的瓦斯的产量，大约增加百分之八十。扩大利用瓦斯来满足生活上的需要，扩大利用瓦斯来作汽车燃料并从瓦斯取得化学品。
    煤炭工业由于党和苏联政府巨大的全面帮助，在战后年份里已大大增长了。大家知道，它充分满足着国民经济的需要。在新五年计划期间，规定煤的开采量大约增加百分之四十三。煤炭工业最重要的任务是保证更迅速地增加炼焦用煤的开采量，同时并大大扩大选煤工作。炼焦用煤的开采量至少增加百分之五十，选煤工作大约扩大为二点七倍。规定使用的煤矿生产能力比第四个五年计划期间大约增加百分之三十。为了保证达到规定增加的煤炭开采量，提高生产率，并减轻煤炭工业中工人的劳动，规定进一步改进开采煤藏的方法，发展采煤工作中最费力的操作过程——在采煤场上装煤，在巷道掘进过程中装煤和装石——的机械化，并广泛采用最新式的机器和机械来扩大采煤工作的机械化。
    进一步发展泥炭和页岩工业。在五年期间，增加泥炭开采量百分之二十七，增加页岩开采量为二点三倍，特别是在爱沙尼亚苏维埃社会主义共和国。
    在保证国民经济高速度发展方面、在保证以技术进一步武装工业、运输业、农业方面起巨大作用的，是机器制造业。根据这一点，在第五个五年计划里规定进一步迅速发展机器制造业。在五年期间，机器制造业和金属品制造业的产量大约增加为二倍。机器制造业特别重要的任务，是充分供应电站、黑色金属冶炼业、有色金属冶炼业、炼油厂、人造液体燃料厂和化学工厂以各种装备。规定在这五年期间，各种最重要设备的产量比第四个五年计划期间增加如下：蒸气透平和水力透平大约增加为四点三倍，辗压设备大约增加为二点八倍，炼油设备大约增加为五点二倍。
    同时规定大大增加化学装备、起重搬运装备的生产，增加载重力极大的供冶炼业用的特别起重机和桥梁式电力起重机的生产，增加制造建筑器材的全套装备的生产，增加供轻工业和食品工业用的自动装备、特别是织布机的生产，增加各种新式农业机器的生产，增加供伐木、制造纸浆和纸、木材加工工业用的装备的生产。
    规定干线机车、内燃机车、电气机车及车厢的生产，以适应铁路运输的需要。
    将增加拖拉机和汽车、特别是具有巨大载重能力的柴油汽车以及瓦斯汽车的生产。
    规定大大发展制造海上船舶、内河船舶以及渔船的造船业。
    应当认真进一步发展工作母机制造业和精密机器制造业。保证供给国民经济以先进技术装备，首先是取决于这两种制造业的发展水平。
    在第五个五年计划期间，将供给工业以高度效率的金属切削工作母机和铸造压形机，其数量要比第四个五年计划期间多得多，其中巨型的和罕有的工作母机大约增加为三点六倍，高度准确的（精密的）工作母机大约增加为四倍。这就可以大大增加各种先进工作母机的比重，保证机器制造业技术水平进一步的提高，并保证技术上完善的机器和装备的产量能满足苏联国民经济及与苏联友好的各民主国家的需要。
    在现代大机器生产的条件下，仪器制造业具有日益巨大的意义。仪器生产是对复杂机器生产的必需的和重要的补充，因为操纵复杂机器，正如操纵全部现代化的技术操作过程一样，没有整套仪器是不行的。仪器产量的增长也反映着生产自动化——技术进步最重要的标志之一——的发展。指示规定：在五年期间，操纵仪器和检查仪器的生产大约增加为二点七倍。
    机器制造业各部门的巨大发展，使得我们能在第五个五年计划期间基本上完成工业和建筑业中繁重费力的劳动的机械化，这是在以技术进一步武装国民经济方面、在提高生产率和减轻工人劳动方面的卓越成就。
    在化学工业中，苏打、人造橡胶、矿质肥料的生产应当达到高速度的增长。和一九五○年相比，苏打灰的生产大约增加百分之八十四，苛性苏打的生产大约增加百分之七十九，人造橡胶的生产大约增加百分之八十二，矿质肥料的生产大约增加百分之八十八。必须大大增大阿摩尼亚、硫酸、人造橡胶、人造酒精、苏打、矿质肥料、消灭农作物病虫
    的化学品、保证农作物产量巨大增加的粒状肥料方面的生产能力。同时必须增加塑胶、染料、人造丝原料的生产，扩大化学品的品种，并发展人造材料——有色金属代用品的生产。
    木材工业现在还是落后于国民经济日益增长的需要。任务是在于消灭这种落后现象。在五年期间，经济用材大道运搬量应当大约增加百分之五十六，木材的生产大约增加百分之五十。同时必须将伐木业大规模地转移到大森林地区，特别是北部、乌拉尔、卡列里—芬兰苏维埃社会主义共和国的各地区，减少森林不多的地区的伐木工作。必须减轻伐木业的季节性，在伐木区改造和建设新的机械化的伐木场，给这些伐木场配备固定的工人干部。同时要进一步展开伐木工作的全套机械化，改进生产的组织和对装备的利用，提高伐木工作的劳动生产率。为了增加锯木的生产，在伐木业发达的地区，应当使木材工厂的生产能力比第四个五年计划期间大约增加为八倍。
    应当尽力发展造纸、纸浆、家具、复合板、木材化学和水解等工业。
    建筑材料工业面临着巨大的任务。所规定的基本建设计划的实现，要求在五年期间把主要建筑材料的生产至少增加为二倍，改进建筑材料的质量并扩大其品种。必须增加水泥的生产大约为二点二倍，增加筑墙材料的生产大约为二点三倍，增加房顶用石板的生产大约为二点六倍，增加软房顶的生产大约为百分之七十，增加瓦的生产大约为三倍。同时应当大大增加工厂制造的新式的以陶器、石膏、混凝土和钢筋混凝土制成的用于装饰和盖面的上等建筑材料、零件和整套材料的生产，这是建筑业进一步工业化和降低建筑成本所必需的。
    在重工业和农业发展的基础上，在五年期间，应当保证高速度地增加日用品的生产。农业原料资源使轻工业和食品工业的产量在五年期间能够至少增加百分之七十。同时，一九五五年棉织品的生产比一九五○年大约增加百分之六十一，丝织品的生产大约增加百分之五十四，皮鞋的生产大约增加百分之五十五，肉类的生产大约增加百分之九十二，捕鱼量大约增加百分之五十八，砂糖的生产大约增加百分之七十八，动物油的生产大约增加百分之七十二，植物油的生产大约增加百分之七十七，罐头的生产大约增加为二点一倍。
    将要建设许多轻工业和食品工业的企业：织布联合厂、纺纱厂、人造纤维工厂、丝织厂、被服厂、针织厂、皮鞋厂、糖厂、油厂、蔬菜干制厂以及糖果、罐头、酒类、肉品、鱼品、牛油和奶酪制造业的工厂。
    同时必须大大增加地方工业企业和工艺合作社企业的日用品、家庭生活用品和当地建筑材料的生产。在五年期间，地方工业企业和工艺合作社企业的工业品产量大约增加百分之六十。为了完成这个计划，地方苏维埃应当改进对地方工业和工艺合作社的领导，以便更充分地利用地方原料和巨大国营企业的废料，扩大居民所需要的日用品种类，提高产品质量，保证降低其成本，改进地方工业和工艺合作社各个作坊以满足居民的生活需要。
    国民经济的利益要求在各工业部门里进一步扩大产品的品种并认真改进其质量。某些企业超额完成了增产计划但使规定的产品质量和品种受到了损害，这种作法是决不容许的。提高产品质量是我国工业头等重要的任务。改进产品质量能保证更经济地利用物质资源，减少由于出产不合标准的产品而遭受的损失。日用品质量的提高和品种的扩大，具有着特别的意义。苏联消费者对产品的质量和品种合理地提出了日益更高的要求。我国工业一定要充分满足居民的这些日益增长的需要，不容许生产消费者不需要的物品。
    为了保证产品的高度质量，必须更广泛地采用适合现代要求的国家标准，并且更有效地利用奖金制度及对企业的物质技术供应，以便完成关于产品的名目和品种的计划。
    完成五年计划在工业方面的任务的最重要条件，是在采用先进定额和消灭企业中阻碍充分利用设备的缺点的基础上，最充分地利用生产能力。应该指出，在第四个五年计划期间，许多工业部门曾经故意缩减了利用生产能力方面的任务，但在执行计划的进程中却把它大大超过了。这首先是指黑色金属冶炼业和化学工业。直到现在，个别工业部门还有故意缩减企业生产能力的现象；政府各部不发掘这些企业现有的潜力，因而限制了许多种极重要产品生产的发展。
    政府各部故意缩减生产能力和设备利用定额的现象，不仅在工厂经营中被发现，而且在正建筑的企业的技术设计中被发现。往往有这样的情形，一个企业还仅仅在建筑中时，它的技术设计中所指明的生产能力已经要求修正，不需要任何补充经费就能增加。
    各计划机关对于故意缩减生产能力要负不小的责任。苏联国家计划委员会应当改进它的发掘生产潜力并充分利用来完成国家定货的工作，并和主管机关故意缩减生产计划的一切倾向作更坚决的斗争。
    我国具有几个斯大林五年计划期间所建立起来的装备有先进技术的强大生产机构，并且具有工作经验丰富的熟练工人和工程师技术工作人员干部。这就造成了靠更好地利用现有生产能力来不断增加产量的巨大可能性。在新五年计划里，规定靠这一方法来使产量得到巨大的增长。例如，靠改进利用现有熔炉，到一九五五年应当得到五年铣铁总增产量百分之三十左右，靠改进利用煤井，应当得到煤炭总增产量百分之二十五左右，靠更充分地利用水泥制造厂，应当得到水泥总增产量百分之三十左右。在其他工业部门里，改进利用生产能力也有同样重要的意义。
    除了改进利用现有生产能力之外，在新五年计划里还规定了工业的巨大基本建设计划。
    依据提高工业生产的计划，在第五个五年计划里规定国家对工业的基本投资比第四个五年计划大约增加为二倍。应当规定基本投资在发展冶炼业、电站、石油工业以及轻工业企业方面有特别巨大的增加。基本建设计划不仅应当保证大大使用新的企业和机器设备，而且应当改造现有机器设备，增添新设备、实行生产机械化、改善技术操作过程，以保证增加现有企业的生产能力。靠扩充现有企业来增加生产能力，是新五年计划中用最少开支增加生产的最重要的潜力。在基本建设计划里，同时应该规定预先为建立冶炼企业、电站、炼油厂、煤矿、化学工厂创造条件，以便保证这些工业部门在以后年份的必要发展。
    在新五年计划期间，应当改善工业企业建设的地理分布状况，使工业更接近于原料和燃料产地。这样就有可能消灭不合理的和距离过长的铁路货运现象。
    为了满足国民经济在原料和燃料资源方面日益增长的需要，在第五个五年计划里规定进一步展开探测各种自然蕴藏的工作，发现有用的矿藏，首先是有色金属和稀有金属、炼焦用煤、铝原料、石油、丰富的铁矿和其他工业原料。
    顺利完成工业和国民经济其他部门中的建筑计划的最重要条件，是进一步发展建筑工业，巩固和扩大现有建筑机构，以及在进行大规模建设的地区建立新的建筑机构。
    现在建筑工业能够解决比过去年份更巨大和复杂得无比的任务。在战后几年内，建立了和大大扩大了这些巨大的建筑机构，如以建筑黑色金属和有色金属冶炼企业为主的重工业企业建筑部，机器制造业企业建筑部，建筑电站、石油工业企业、煤矿和露天煤矿、铁路和公路、地下铁道、高楼大厦等等的巨大建筑机构。以建筑人民委员部为基础组成的重工业企业建筑部，目前担负的建筑装置工程数量，比一九四○年建筑人民委员部所能担负的大到二倍，如果再加上机器制造业企业建筑部，则比一九四○年建筑人民委员部所能担负的大到三倍多。电站部建筑机构目前担负的建筑装置工程数量，比它们在一九四○年所担负的大四倍多。
    但是，必须进一步认真加强建筑机构。五年计划指示里规定：首先要加强重工业企业建筑部、电站部、石油工业部、煤炭工业部、铁道部的建筑机构，加强修建化学工厂的建筑机构以及机器制造业企业建筑部的建筑机构，这些机构正在建筑制造动力和冶炼设备、炼油设备、巨型的和罕有的工作母机、重型铸造压形机、起重搬运装备的工厂。
    必须保证广泛采用建筑业的工业方法，尽力扩大工厂制造的建筑零件和建筑材料、混凝土、灰泥及其他半成品的生产。因此规定把制造金属建筑物材料的工厂的生产能力最少增加为二倍，建立必要数量的制造钢筋混凝土产品的工厂，扩大各区现有的采石场和组织各区新的采石场，并在采石和处理石块、碎石、小石、沙子以及自然地层石块方面的工作中实行全盘的机械化。
    应当把主要建筑工作机械化，并保证由个别工作过程的机械化过渡到建筑工作的全盘机械化。规定在五年期间把建筑业的掘凿机数目大约增加为二点五倍，铲土机数目大约增加为三倍，开路机数目大约增加为四倍，可移动的起重机数目增加为四点五倍。建筑工作人员一定要认真改善对日益增多的机器和机械的利用。
    必须改进建筑业中的设计工作，不容许设计中有铺张现象，缩短设计期限，并保证及时设计建筑工地的蓝图和概算。因此，必须以熟练干部加强设计机构，并在建筑中广泛采用标准的设计。
    二、第五个五年计划在农业方面的任务
    在农业方面，主要的任务今后仍然是通过进一步巩固和发展集体农庄公共经济、在农业应用现代机器和技术的基础上改进国营农场和农业机器站的工作，以提高一切农作物的单位面积产量，进一步增加公共的牲畜总数并同时大量提高其产物生产率，增加农业和牲畜饲养业的总产量和商品作物产量。
    规定谷物总产量在五年期间增加百分之四十至百分之五十，其中小麦的生产应增加百分之五十五至六十五，原棉的生产应增加百分之五十五至六十五，亚麻纤维的生产应增加百分之四十至五十，甜菜的生产应增加百分之六十五至七十，向日葵的生产应增加百分之五十至六十。同样要增加马铃薯、大麻、烟草、马合烟叶和其他农作物的生产。进一步发展果艺业、葡萄种植业和橘类种植业。
    规定迅速发展牲畜饲养业。与一九五○年相比，一九五五年肉类和油脂总产量增加百分之八十至九十，牛奶总产量增加百分之四十五至五十，羊毛总产量增加为二倍至三倍半。在莫斯科、列宁格勒的郊区以及其他大城市和工业中心的郊区，发展蔬菜、马铃薯的生产以及牛奶、肉类、蛋类的生产。我国农业必须具有更大的生产率和更高的熟练程度，必须实行发达的牧草种植法和正确的农作物轮种制，必须分配更多的土地来种植技术作物、饲料、蔬菜和马铃薯。
    在第五个五年计划里，规定大大增加农作物的单位面积产量，并指定全国各主要地区的任务。它们的任务如下：
    提高每公顷谷物的产量：南乌克兰和北高加索各区，增加到二十至二十二公担，受灌溉的田地增加到三十至三十四公担；伏尔加河流域各区，增加到十四至十五公担，受灌溉的田地增加到二十五至二十八公担；中央黑土地带各省，增加到十六至十八公担，受灌溉的田地增加到三十至三十四公担；非黑土地带，增加到十七至十九公担；乌拉尔、西伯利亚及卡查赫斯坦东北部各区，增加到十五至十六公担，受灌溉的田地增加到二十四至二十六公担；南高加索各区，增加到二十至二十二公担，受灌溉的田地增加到三十至三十四公担；水稻每公顷产量增加到四十至五十公担。
    提高每公顷棉花的产量：中央亚细亚及卡查赫斯坦南部各区，增加到二十六至二十七公担；南高加索各区增加到二十五至二十七公担；欧洲部分南部各区的水田产量增加到十一至十三公担，非水田产量增加到五至七公担。
    提高其他作物每公顷的产量：
    将非黑土地带各区的亚麻纤维每公顷产量增加到四点五至五点五公担，乌拉尔和西伯利亚各区增加到四至五公担。
    乌克兰苏维埃社会主义共和国、摩尔达维亚苏维埃社会主义共和国和北高加索各区的甜菜每公顷产量增加到二百五十五至二百六十五公担，中央黑土地带各区增加到二百至二百一十公担，中央亚细亚和卡查赫斯坦各区增加到四百至四百二十五公担。
    非黑土地带各区的马铃薯每公顷产量增加到一百五十五至一百七十五公担，中央黑土地带各区增加到一百四十至一百六十公担，南部及北高加索各区增加到一百三十五至一百五十五公担，乌拉尔和西伯利亚各区增加到一百二十五至一百四十五公担。
    乌克兰苏维埃社会主义共和国、摩尔达维亚苏维埃社会主义共和国和北高加索各区的向日葵每公顷产量增加到十七至二十公担，中央黑土地带各区增加到十四点五至十六点五公担，伏尔加河流域各区增加到十至十二公担。
    最重要作物总产量的增加，大部分是靠单位面积产量的增加来保证的。由于单位面积产量的增加，谷物总产量将大约增加百分之九十，原棉总产量大约增加百分之五十，甜菜总产量大约增加百分之六十以上。
    在第四个五年计划期间，已在苏联欧洲部分各草原区和森林草原区着手实行了大规模的斯大林改造大自然的计划。现在我们已经有过渡到普遍应用正确农业经营方法的一切可能性了。第五个五年计划规定在集体农庄和国营农场的田野上种植森林地带，这不仅在苏联欧洲部分的草原区和森林草原区是如此，而且在西伯利亚、中亚细亚的草原区以及其他地区也是如此。规定在五年期间，在集体农庄和国营农场上至少种植二百五十万公顷的防护林带，并种植二百五十万公顷左右的国家林带。
    在第四个五年计划的年份里，在集体农庄和国营农场实行正确的轮种制和先进的耕地法方面，已经做了很多的工作。但是，这个工作存在着严重的缺点。各州、边区与共和国的农业部、党机关和苏维埃机关都必须改进其运用草田轮种制的工作，并保证普遍采用正确的耕地法。第五个五年计划的指示规定进一步发展牧草种植把这当作是增加农作物产量和巩固牲畜饲养业的饲料基地的最重要方法之一，并规定扩大在集体农庄和国营农场运用正确的草田轮种制的工作。运用轮种制，必须作到能保证按照国家计划每年增加谷物、棉花、甜菜、亚麻纤维、其他农作物和牲畜饲料的生产。必须在集体农庄和国营农场的田地上增加使用矿质肥料和有机物肥料。
    增加农作物的单位面积产量和总产量的任务，向科学研究机关、选种试验站和农业机关提出这样的要求：在生产中采用产量更大的谷物新品种、产量更多而早熟的棉花品种，含糖量更多的甜菜品种、含油量更大的向日葵品种，同时培育在受灌溉的田地上种植的农作物新品种。必须保证在米丘林学说的基础上进一步发展苏联的农艺生物学，并且在集体农庄和国营农场上广泛采用农业中的科学成就和先进经验。
    在第五个五年计划里，规定广泛进行水利设施。在五年期间，受灌溉的田地面积增加百分之三十至三十五，排去积水的土地面积增加百分之四十至四十五。规定在集体农庄和国营农场上建设大约三万五千个池塘和蓄水池。
    正在进行的以临时灌溉渠代替永久灌溉渠而过渡到新式灌溉系统的工作，是扩大水田面积和提高水田产量的一个重大的手段。规定到五年计划结束时各水田农业区完全过渡到新式灌溉系统。
    规定在灌溉方面的首要工作，是修建以利用古比雪夫水电站电力为基础的灌溉系统和供水系统以及在列宁伏尔加河—顿河通航运河地区修建灌溉系统和供水系统。计划在斯大林格勒水电站、土库曼大运河、南乌克兰运河和北克里米亚运河一带着手建设灌溉系统和供水系统。同时规定进行修建引水灌溉古仑达草原土地的灌溉系统的准备工作。在中央黑土地带各州、在库拉—阿拉克斯低地、在西尔河、塞拉夫森河和卡什卡河流域，在中弗尔干纳、库班—伊哥尔斯克水系、奥尔托—托科伊水库和楚河大运河各地区，将继续进行建筑灌溉系统的工作。要用强大的技术基础来保证这些工作的进行。现在农业具有相当数目的掘土机。一九五一年农业中的掘凿机总数，比一九四○年大约增加为八倍。现在水利工程建筑业已经装备了巨大数量的铲土机、开路机、筑路机和其他机械。
    广大的灌溉系统网，加上防护林带、正确的轮种制和其他先进的农艺方法，将保证我国极大地区农业大大发展的基础，因为在这些地区，由于缺乏水和常闹旱灾，农作物的收获直到最近仍然是不稳定的，而牲畜饲养业则苦于水和饲料不足。鉴于水田面积像所规定的一样有极大增加，而国家又以巨量资金用于这些水田的灌溉，必须要求农业工作人员改进对于受灌溉的田地的利用。我们利用具有灌溉网的土地还不能令人满意，特别是在卡查赫苏维埃社会主义共和国、土库曼苏维埃社会主义共和国与阿捷尔拜疆苏维埃社会主义共和国。必须整顿对这些田地的使用，采取办法保证受灌溉的田地有很高的农作物产量，并预防这些田地发生盐化和变成沼泽。第五个五年计划规定，在白俄罗斯苏维埃社会主义共和国、乌克兰苏维埃社会主义共和国（首先在波列西埃低地各区）、立陶宛苏维埃社会主义共和国、拉脱维亚苏维埃社会主义共和国、爱沙尼亚苏维埃社会主义共和国、卡列里—芬兰苏维埃社会主义共和国、俄罗斯苏维埃联邦社会主义共和国非黑土地带各区、巴拉宾斯克草原，大大扩大沼泽地带的排水工作。
    尽力发展集体农庄和国营农场的具有高度生产率的公共牲畜饲养业，在新的五年计划中仍然是党机关和苏维埃机关的注意中心。规定在五年期间，整个农业方面的牛增加百分之十八至二十，其中集体农庄的牛增加百分之三十六至三十八，母牛大约增加为二倍；整个农业方面的绵羊增加百分之六十至六十二，其中集体农庄的绵羊增加百分之七十五至八十；整个农业方面的猪增加百分之四十五至五十，其中集体农庄的猪增加百分之八十五至九十。
    必须大大提高牲畜饲养业的产物生产率。指示规定：
    使非黑土地带各区集体农庄每头母牛的产奶量达到一千八百至二千公斤，中央黑土地带各州达到一千七百至二千公斤，南部和伏尔加河流域各区达到一千六百至一千九百公斤，西伯利亚、乌拉尔和卡查赫斯坦东北部各区达到一千五百至一千七百公斤，中亚细亚各区达到七百至九百公斤，南高加索各区达到九百至一千一百公斤。
    将南部和北高加索各区集体农庄细毛绵羊每头的剪毛量，增加到五点二至五点八公斤，半细毛绵羊每头的剪毛量增加到四点二到四点八公斤；中央黑土地带各州集体农庄细毛绵羊每头的剪毛量增加到四点二至五公斤，半细毛绵羊每头的剪毛量增加到四至四点二公斤；伏尔加河流域各区细毛绵羊每头的剪毛量增加到四点六至五点四公斤，半细毛绵羊每头的剪毛量增加到三点九至四点五公斤；西伯利亚各区细毛绵羊每头的剪毛量增加到四点三至四点九公斤，半细毛绵羊每头的剪毛量增加到三点八至四点二公斤。
    为了完成牲畜饲养业方面的任务，必须普遍保证正确的牲畜饲养法。在五年期间，饲料作物的播种大约增加百分之七十，而牧草、秣草、饲料用根类作物的单位面积产量至少增加为二倍。
    在发展乳牛饲养业方面，必须特别注意进一步实行更完备的牲畜饲养制度——棚内饲养制，而对各地区的特点则应加以考虑。对于我们的农业，特别是在荒地开垦了很多的地区，过渡到棚内牲畜饲养制是十分迫切的，并且能大大提高乳牛饲养业的生产率。我们有充分的可能来解决牲畜饲养业的这个最重要的任务，办法就是广泛种植牧草、饲料用根类作物、秣草和其他作物，在生产率不大的草地和牧场采用轮种制以保证全年能用新鲜的和多汁的饲料来饲养牲畜。
    绵羊饲养业获得广大的发展基地，特别是在列宁伏尔加河—顿河通航运河沿岸、里海低地、诺盖斯克草原与土库曼大运河一带受灌溉的地区。必须在这些地区建立适于放牧大群和最大群绵羊的巩固的饲养基地。
    在新的五年计划中，认为农业机器站是现在已经担任了集体农庄整个田间工作的三分之二以上的巨大国营企业，在它面前提出了很大的严重的任务。
    必须保证进一步改进农业机器站的工作，扩大它们使集体农庄各生产部门中费力劳动机械化的活动，加重农业机器站对于完成提高农作物单位面积产量和牲畜饲养业产品生产率的计划所担负的责任。在这个五年计划期间，必须完成集体农庄田间工作的机械化。使牲畜饲养业、蔬菜业和果园业中的费力劳动，农产品的运输装卸工作，灌溉工程和沼泽排水工程以及新地区的开发工作都实行广泛的机械化。在五年期间，在特别迅速增加耕地拖拉机的条件下，把农业机器站全部拖拉机的工作能力大约增加为一点五倍。在一九五五年，在集体农庄的田地上为每一百公顷播种面积工作的拖拉机的工作能力，比一九四○年将增加百分之七十，而比一九五○年将增加百分之三十。此外，农业中的卡车、固定发动机和其他机器的总数也将增加。规定供给农业以大量新的更完善的犁、耘土机、播种机、摘棉机、甜菜联合收割机、牧草收割机、饲料青贮设备、电气剪羊毛机、电气榨乳机以及其他农业机器。农业机器站、国营农场和集体农庄的任务就是要大大改进对这种技术的利用。
    在第五个五年计划期间，必须扩大农业对电力的使用。最重要的任务之一，就是制造完善的器械，并在农业中采用电气拖拉机以及其他用廉价电力推动的农业机器，特别是在有大水电站的地区要如此。
    为了完成五年计划在进一步发展农业和牲畜饲养业方面的任务，要求进一步巩固农业劳动组合，正确选择和配置集体农庄的领导干部，提高这些干部的工作熟练程度。必须保证尽力发展公共经济，正确配合农业和牲畜饲养业的各部门，大大提高劳动生产率，改进劳动的组织和报酬，尽量减少农业的损失，这样来增加集体农庄的财富。集体农庄的收入增长了，不可分割的资金增加了，这就可以在集体农庄广泛展开建设，使基本投资首先用于发展公共经济——修建农场建筑和牲畜饲养建筑、灌溉沟渠和排水沟渠、蓄水池，铲除灌木林，种植防护林带，修建集体农庄电站以及其他建筑。
    在国营农场建设方面，最重要的任务是增加供应市场的产品——首先是小麦、上等和中等羊毛、肉类，——并保证供给集体农庄牲畜饲养业以纯种公畜。必须规定大大提高国营农场的农作物单位面积产量和牲畜饲养业的产品生产率，并且在这个基础上大大减低产品成本。
    为了改进国营农场的工作，规定完成田地耕作、牲畜饲养、饲料采集和饲料预备工作中一切最费力的劳动的全盘机械化。必须采取办法进一步巩固国营农场，保证国营农场有足够的专家干部和固定工人，把一切国营农场变为农业中具有高度生产率和高度商品生产量的企业。
    在第五个五年计划期间，国家将向农业投入大量的资金：国家基本投资总额比第四个五年计划期间大约增加为二点一倍，而在水利建设方面大约增加为四倍。
    在新的五年计划中，摆在农业面前的巨大任务，要求农业部、地方党机关和苏维埃机关大大改进对农业的领导。必须依靠国家对农业的大量帮助，广泛地利用由于农业和牲畜饲养业总产量和商品生产量的增加而有的巨大储备，使每个集体农庄、国营农场和农业机器站都能完成国家的计划。
    三、五年计划在商品流通、运输和邮电方面的任务
    第五个五年计划指示里规定，在提高工业和农业生产的基础上，在五年期间，把国营商业和合作社商业的零售商品流通额大约增加百分之七十。
    规定大大增加出售给居民的最重要食品和工业品，以及文化生活和家常生活的用品。例如，一九五五年和一九五○年相比，出售给居民的肉类产品大约增加百分之九十，鱼类产品大约增加百分之七十，动物油大约增加百分之七十，乳酪大约增加为二倍，糖大约增加为二倍。并且规定要大大增加出售的工业品：棉毛丝麻织品大约增加百分之七十，服装大约增加百分之八十，鞋类大约增加百分之八十，针织品大约增加为二点二倍。出售文化生活用品应当增加如下：家具大约增加为三倍，金属食器大约增加为二点五倍，缝纫机大约增加为二点四倍，脚踏车大约增加为三点五倍，无线电收音机和电视机大约增加为二倍，钟表大约增加为二点二倍，家庭冰箱、洗衣机和吸尘器大约增加几倍。同时规定扩大食堂、饭店、茶厅的分布网，把公共饮食企业的食品产量大约增加百分之八十，并大大增加食品的品种。
    为了进一步改善对消费者的服务，规定扩大零售贸易网，首先是扩大出售食品、服装、鞋类、织品、家具、食器、家庭用具、文化用品和建筑材料的专门商店网，并以冷藏器和最新设备供给食品店、食堂、饭店和仓库。
    新五年计划所规定的工业生产和农业生产的增长以及商品流通额的增长，都要求大大发展运输业。在五年期间，各种运输的货运额应当大约增加百分之四十六。其中铁路货运额增加百分之三十五至四十，内河货运额增加百分之七十五至八十，海上货运额增加百分之五十五至六十，汽车货运额增加百分之八十至八十五，航空货运额至少增加为二倍，石油产品管道运输量大约增加为五倍。
    铁路货运额的增加，是进一步提高铁路货运强度的条件。因此，铁路运输方面最重要的任务，是提高铁路的运转能力。
    为了提高铁路的运转能力，规定进行一系列的巨大措施。计有：
    与前一个五年计划比较，双轨的使用大约增加百分之六十，电气铁路大约增加为四倍，使侧线长度增加到铁路行车线长度的百分之四十六。
    大大增加新铁路的修筑。在第五个五年计划期间，新通车的铁路应当大约为第四个五年计划期间的二倍半。将完成西伯利亚南部干线从阿巴坎到阿克摩林斯克一段铁路以及查尔约——孔格勒一线铁路的修建工程；展开下列各铁路线的建筑工程：孔格勒——马卡特线，克拉斯诺雅尔斯克——叶尼塞斯克线，阿格雷兹——普罗宁诺——苏尔古特线，古里耶夫——阿斯特拉罕线及其他铁路。规定继续供给主要铁路线以各种最新式的信号设备、自动设备、闭塞装置，以保证提高运转能力和行车安全。
    为了加强铁路的路线管理工作，规定为铁路运输供应新的铁轨，应当比第四个五年计划增加百分之八十五，碎石路基的铁路长度应当增加为二倍。在这个五年计划期间，应当使现有车皮大体上都装上自动联结钩，并开始以滚珠轴箱装备车辆。工业应当充分供给铁路运输以各种机车和车皮，开始制造新式的牵引力强大的机车、电气机车、内燃机车、其中包括煤气机车。
    铁道部最重要的任务之一，是尽力改进对车辆的使用，尤其是缩短车皮周转时间，增加机车平均每昼夜行车里数，以及保证大大改进对车辆货运能力的利用，并增加货运列车的载重量。实现所规定的运转方面的任务，要求铁路运输所有环节，在执行政府的关于加强劳动纪律和改善与行车有关的工作人员的劳动组织、特别是机车乘务组的劳动组织的决定的基础上，使工作准确和协调起来。
    在这个五年计划期间，由于列宁伏尔加河—顿河通航运河开始通航，内河运输的潜力已大大增加了。此外，在第五个五年计划期间，将进行伏尔加河—波罗的海水路的改建工程，增加卡马河的航行深度。已完工的斯大林白海—波罗的海运河、莫斯科运河、列宁伏尔加河—顿河通航运河的巨大水利建筑工程，以及所规定的伏尔加河—波罗的海水路的改建工程和伏尔加河与卡马河上的水电站的建筑工程，使得在第五个五年计划期间可以把苏联欧洲部分的单一的深水运输系统基本上建立起来。内河运输部的首要任务是充分掌握这一运输系统来大量运送客货。
    由于内河货运的大大增加以及新水路的建成，规定建造可以在大水库中航行的客货轮船、内燃机轮船、拖船和驳船；应当靠建筑新港口，改建现有港口，以高度效率的机械化工具配备各港口，这样来把内河港口的吐纳量大约增加为二倍。
    应当消灭西伯利亚各河流域的内河运输落后现象，提高内河运输在极北地区货运方面的作用。
    同时必须发展小河航运，以满足地方性的需要。
    为了大量增加海洋商船的吨位、其中包括油船的吨位，规定建设新的造船厂和修船厂并扩大现有的造船厂和修船厂，以扩大本国建造海洋船舶的基础。在五年期间，海港吐纳量和航海船舶修理厂的工作能力应当大约增加为二倍。规定扩大和改建列宁格勒、敖德萨、日丹诺夫、诺沃罗西斯克、玛哈赤喀拉、摩尔曼斯克、纳良—马尔和远东等地的海港，扩大里加和克莱帕达的港口。
    规定把北方海路的运货量增加到足以保证不间断地供应北极和极北地区的居民、企业、建筑现场，用新的破冰船来充实海洋船舶，广泛发展连拿河流域的货运。
    修筑硬面汽车路的里数，应当比第四个五年计划大约增加百分之五十，特别是在南部地区、南高加索及波罗的海沿岸。
    必须密切注意改进对数量迅速增长的汽车的使用，并降低汽车运输成本。为此目的，规定大大增加公共汽车运输在货运和客运方面的比重，完成巩固现有的并建立新的地域的经济核算的机关汽车系统。扩大汽车修理厂和汽车技术服务站的分布网。各城市间的固定客运汽车路线的长度大约增加为二倍。在一切大城市里创办公共汽车。
    大大扩展航空交通网，用装备了最新式飞行仪器的飞机来增加运输机的总额，并增加具有昼夜航行设备的机场数量。
    在邮电方面，规定加强各城市间的电话和电报通讯，以及无线电通讯。大大增加无线电广播电台的广播能力，以改进苏联全境和世界各国收听苏联广播的条件。发展超短波广播和无线电转播通讯的工作。城市电话局的工作能力应当提高百分之三十至三十五。
    依据进一步发展运输业和邮电业的计划，在第五个五年计划期间，国家对运输业和邮电业的基本投资，应当比第四个五年计划期间大约增加百分之六十三。
    四、第五个五年计划在进一步提高人民的物质福利、保健事业和文化水平方面的任务
    所规定的社会主义生产的增长和劳动生产率的提高，保证大量增加国民收入和进一步提高人民的物质福利。在五年期间，苏联国民收入至少增加百分之六十，这就保证进一步大量增加工人和职员的收入、农民的收入。
    依据生产量和劳动生产率的提高，并且依据文化建设方面的任务，规定在一九五五年，国民经济部门中的工人和职员人数应当比一九五○年大约增加百分之十五。
    在新五年计划期间，将进一步降低日用品的零售价格。不断地降低物价，是有系统地提高工人和职员实际工资与提高农民收入的主要手段。
    在五年期间，工人和职员的实际工资至少增加百分之三十五（零售价格的降低也计算在内）。国家对工人和职员社会保险的拨款，比一九五○年大约增加百分之三十。
    集体农庄庄员劳动生产率的提高，集体农庄生产的增长，农业和牲畜饲养业产量的增加，保证集体农庄庄员的现金收入和实物收入至少提高百分之四十（以现金计算）。
    为了进一步改善工人和职员的居住条件，在第五个五年计划期间，应当完成大规模住宅建设的计划。因此对各城市和工人居住区住宅建设的基本投资，比前一个五年计划大约增加为二倍。单是国家建筑系统在各城市和工人居住区建筑的新的住宅，其面积便规定为一亿零五百万平方公尺。此外，还要进行私人住宅建设，由居民用国家的贷款或用自己的储蓄来修建。同时应当指出，在前一个五年计划期间，是大规模地恢复被破坏的住宅，而在这个五年计划期间，要建筑的全是质量更高和设备更加完善的新住宅。
    除了完成大规模住宅建设的计划，还将实行广泛措施来进一步改进居民公用设备及增进居民生活便利的各种设备——扩大自来水道和下水道，增加对住宅的热力和煤气的供应，扩大城市交通并改善城市和工人居住区的设备。
    在第五个五年计划期间，应当完成国民保健事业方面的严重任务。规定进一步扩大医院、诊疗所、产育院、疗养院、托儿所和幼儿园的分布网。医院的病床数目至少增加百分之二十，疗养院的收容位数大约增加百分之十五，休养所的收容位数大约增加百分之三十，托儿所的收容位数大约增加百分之二十，幼儿园的收容位数大约增加百分之四十。保证进一步供给医院、诊疗所、疗养院以最新的医疗设备，并提高它们的工作水平。全国医生人数在五年期间至少增加百分之二十五，并扩大医生进修的设施。
    药品、医疗设备和器械的生产应当至少增加为二倍半，尤其应当尽速扩大最新式药品和医疗预防药剂的生产，以及现代最新式的诊断和治疗设备的生产。
    保证进一步展开体育运动。
    除了提高劳动人民的物质福利以外，必须保证社会主义文化进一步的高涨。我们提出这一任务：到五年计划结束时，在各共和国首都、共和国直辖市、州和边区的中心城市以及大工业中心，把七年制教育完全改为普及中等教育（十年制教育），并为下一个五年计划期间在其他城市和农村中完全实行普及中等教育（十年制教育）准备条件。因此，各城市的学校八年级到十年级的学生人数，到一九五五年应当比一九五○年增加为四倍，农村中等学校八年级到十年级的学生人数应当增加为四倍半。
    为了顺利完成教育方面重大的而且在颇大程度上是新的任务，要求扩大培养师资的工作，改进国民教育机关的工作。规定在设立城市和农村学校方面，比前一个五年计划大约增加百分之七十。
    为了进一步提高普通学校的社会主义教育的意义，为了保证中等学校毕业生以自由选择职业的条件，规定着手在中等学校实行综合技术教育，并采取为过渡到普及综合技术教育所必需的措施。
    依据进一步发展国民经济和文化建设的任务，在五年期间，高等和中等专门学校培养出来的各种专家必须增加百分之三十至三十五，其中由高等学校培养出来的在百分之五十以上。高等学校在一九五五年为最重要的工业、建筑业和农业部门培养出来的专家，比一九五○年大约增加为二倍。
    在保证苏联技术的进步和社会主义文化的提高方面起重要作用的苏联科学，在新五年计划期间将得到国家巨大的支持。通过高等学校和科学研究机关研究班培养出来的科学研究人员和科学教育研究人员，比前一个五年计划大约增加为二倍。规定把大量的基本投资用于科学研究院和高等学校的建设。最大的科学和学术中心——国立莫斯科大学大厦的建筑工程已经完成。
    科学研究院和高等学校应当大大改进科学工作，更充分地利用科学工作人员来解决国民经济发展中极重要的问题并概括先进的经验。必须保证广泛地实际地应用科学的发明，尽力协助科学家解决他们在各种知识领域中研究的理论问题，并加强科学与生产的联系。
    鉴于成年居民对于提高他们的教育的愿望日益提高，规定进一步发展函授的和夜间的高等和中等专门学校，并发展使劳动公民在不脱离生产而受到教育的普通学校。规定广泛实行进一步提高生产工人熟练程度的办法。
    为了更好地满足国民经济对熟练干部的日益增长的需要，——特别是由于先进经验在生产中的进一步采用，——规定改进在国家劳动后备力量系统内培养青年熟练工人的工作效率，改进在生产中培养工人的工作效率。
    为了更好地满足居民日益增长的文化要求，在第五个五年计划期间应当保证进一步发展电影和电视事业、图书馆、俱乐部、报纸刊物。必须扩大电影院网，在五年期间把影片放映设备的数量大约增加百分之二十五，并增加影片的产量，特别是彩色影片的产量。在五年期间，公共图书馆网至少扩大百分之三十，俱乐部网扩大百分之十五；同时应当改进它们为居民服务的工作。规定大量增加文艺作品和科学著作、教科书、杂志和报纸的出版，扩充出版印刷业，并改进书籍的印刷和装订的质量。
    按照上述的保健事业、教育、科学和文化教育机关的发展，在五年期间，这些方面的国家基本投资总额，比前一个五年计划大约增加百分之五十。

    这就是新五年计划在国民经济方面和提高劳动人民物质文化生活水平方面的极重要的任务。这些任务证明，苏联经济的发展的确是在一日千里地进行着。大家知道，头三个五年计划，更确切些说，伟大卫国战争以前的和平建设的十三个年头，按其规模来说，是生产巨大增长的时期。斯大林同志在说明这个时期的特点时指示说：“生产的这样空前的增长，决不能认为是国家由落后到进步的一种简单寻常的发展。这乃是使我们祖国由落后国变成了先进国、由农业国变成了工业国的一个飞跃。”现在苏联还拥有扩大社会主义生产的巨大潜力。如果拿新五年计划在发展生产方面的任务与头三个五年计划时期（十三个年头）国民经济发展的实际总结加以比较，我们就可以看出：第五个五年计划在许多种极重要产品的增产量方面是与战前三个五年计划的总额相等的，而有某几种产品则甚至超过了这个总额。例如，在第五个五年计划中规定的铣铁、石油、电力、棉织品以及其他极重要产品的增产量，都大大超过这些产品在战前三个五年计划时期——从一九二七—一九二八年到一九四○年的增产量。
    在新五年计划中保证各盟员共和国经济和文化进一步的高涨。第五个五年计划再次辉煌地表明了，苏联各族人民间的友谊愈来愈巩固，他们共同奔向一个目标——建成共产主义社会，尽力加强苏联即我们祖国各族人民繁荣富强的牢固基础的经济实力。
    第五个五年计划中发展立陶宛苏维埃社会主义共和国、拉脱维亚苏维埃社会主义共和国与爱沙尼亚苏维埃社会主义共和国的经济和文化的任务，也就是苏联政府对各盟员共和国的需要极端重视的确凿的例子。还在第四个五年计划的总结中，立陶宛苏维埃社会主义共和国、拉脱维亚苏维埃社会主义共和国与爱沙尼亚苏维埃社会主义共和国的工业产量便比一九四○年增加为二点八倍，而在第五个五年计划期间则还要大大增加。在新五年计划期间，这些共和国要进一步工业化。因此规定增加发电量为二倍到二倍半，修建纳尔瓦水电站、里加火力发电站，并展开考那斯水电站的建设工程。应当进行修建波罗的海沿岸的水电站的勘察设计工作。在发展页岩化学工业的基础上，保证使爱沙尼亚苏维埃社会主义共和国的人造瓦斯的生产增加为二倍到二倍半，人造液体燃料的生产增加百分之八十，建成并使用从科特拉—雅尔维到塔林的瓦斯输送管。规定进一步发展机器制造业：立陶宛苏维埃社会主义共和国的造船业、透平制造业、电机制造业和工作母机制造业；拉脱维亚苏维埃社会主义共和国的电机制造业、工作母机制造业和造船业；爱沙尼亚苏维埃社会主义共和国的造船业和电机制造业。在爱沙尼亚苏维埃社会主义共和国组织过磷酸盐的生产，并在立陶宛苏维埃社会主义共和国开始修建过磷酸盐工厂。规定在五年期间立陶宛苏维埃社会主义共和国的捕鱼量大约增加为三点九倍，拉脱维亚苏维埃社会主义共和国的捕鱼量大约增加百分之八十，爱沙尼亚苏维埃社会主义共和国的捕鱼量大约增加百分之八十五，并规定扩充这些共和国中现有的鱼品制造企业并建立新的鱼品制造企业。
    规定进一步发展立陶宛苏维埃社会主义共和国、拉脱维亚苏维埃社会主义共和国、爱沙尼亚苏维埃社会主义共和国的具有高度生产率的牲畜饲养业，特别是乳牛业和养猪业。在这些共和国内将进行沼泽地带排水的工作。扩大以拖拉机和农业机器装备了的农业机器站网。
    必须进行关于改造铁路的必要工作，同时改进尼门河和杜加瓦河流域的航运和增加客货载运量。规定在考那斯建造横跨尼门河的桥梁，在里加建造横跨杜加瓦河的桥梁。保证进一步发展立陶宛苏维埃社会主义共和国、拉脱维亚苏维埃社会主义共和国与爱沙尼亚苏维埃社会主义共和国的海上运输，并扩大它们的海港港口。规定大规模修筑和改建汽车公路。
    应当采取发展保健事业和文化的巨大措施。在五年期间，立陶宛苏维埃社会主义共和国的医院病床数目大约增加百分之四十，拉脱维亚苏维埃社会主义共和国的医院病床数目大约增加百分之三十，爱沙尼亚苏维埃社会主义共和国的医院病床数目大约增加百分之三十。
    规定立陶宛苏维埃社会主义共和国师范学院的招生人数增加为二点三倍，拉脱维亚苏维埃社会主义共和国师范学院招生的人数增加百分之九十，爱沙尼亚苏维埃社会主义共和国师范学院招生的人数增加百分之六十。
    在发展其他盟员共和国的经济和文化方面，也规定了同样重大的任务。
    新五年计划的实现不能是自流式地进行的，它要求工人、农民和知识分子作严重的紧张努力，要积极地和创造性地劳动。新五年计划的实现，要求完成巨大的基本建设计划。基本建设在我国过去始终是而且现在仍然是解决共产党提出来的未来首要的经济任务的基本手段，是确定国民经济各部门发展速度和方向的极重要的因素。
    在一九五一——一九五五年，国家基本建设投资总额，规定比第四个五年计划大约增加百分之九十，而国家对基本建设的拨款则增加百分之六十。基本建设投资总额超过拨款总额的数目，应当用提高劳动生产率、减少经常费、降低建筑材料和设备的价格等方法把建设成本适当地降低，这样来加以弥补。
    为了完成所规定的基本建设工程计划，必需动员国民经济一切环节的内在资源和积累来源。
    这一任务的顺利解决，取决于提高劳动生产率、降低生产和流通的费用这些任务的完成，取决于善于经营、能够保证在每一经济建设部门实行真正的节约制度。
    社会主义生产增长、成本降低和积累扩大之最主要的来源，便是提高劳动生产率。在五年期间，劳动生产率在工业方面应当大约增加百分之五十，在建筑业方面应当大约增加百分之五十五，在农业方面应当大约增加百分之四十。在第五个五年计划期间，工业的全部增产量大约有四分之三要靠提高劳动生产率来达到。这样一来，工业生产量大体上是要靠提高劳动生产率来增加的。
    不断提高劳动技术设备的比重，在生产中采用先进的科学和技术，以及进一步改善人民的物质状况和提高劳动人民的文化技术水平，是劳动生产率这种提高的基础。
    在第五个五年计划期间，基本上完成繁重费力的劳动的机械化，而到一九五五年，工业工人劳动所使用的电力，比一九五○年增加百分之七十，比一九四○年增加为二点六倍。广泛展开社会主义生产的劳动的机械化和电气化，将获得特别有利的条件。在没有失业现象的苏联，机器除了给社会节省劳动以外，还减轻工作者的劳动。
    广泛推广最好的企业和生产革新者在使用技术、改善技术操作过程、采用先进生产组织方法方面的经验，对于获得高度劳动生产率，具有着巨大的意义。必须在工程师、技师、工人和集体农庄庄员中间掀起为改善生产方法、提高劳动生产率和降低生产成本的群众性发明和合理化建议的运动。有系统地降低产品成本和工业品发售价格，是发展社会主义工业所应当循行的坦途大道。产品成本的降低，最清楚地表明工业工作的质量，表明工业在改进生产技术、提高劳动生产率和加强经济核算制方面所获得的成就。产品成本的降低和流通费的缩减，是进一步降低零售和批发价格的基础。
    规定在五年期间，工业产品成本大约降低百分之二十五，建筑工程成本大约至少降低百分之二十，农业机器站拖拉机工作成本大约降低百分之二十五，铁路运输成本大约降低百分之十五，零售贸易流通费大约降低百分之二十三。同时必须大大缩减农业品采购、储藏和销售的费用以及工业推销部门的经常费。
    为了完成五年计划在降低生产和流通的费用方面的任务，除了提高劳动生产率以外，必须实行对于物质资源的最严格的节约制度，而办法是消灭浪费材料和设备的铺张现象，加强消灭废品的斗争，采用各种经济适用的材料，广泛利用使用价值完全一样的代用品和先进的生产技术。同时必需尽力认真精减企业和机关的管理机构。
    应当特别注意降低建筑成本。虽然基本建设投资总额大量增加，建筑工程有了先进技术的装备，可是建筑成本仍然很高。必须竭力使工厂，道路、住宅、医院、学校的建筑每年都能给国家节省大批财力。
    所规定的建筑工程成本的降低，应当用建筑劳动进一步机械化和建筑业采用工业方法、缩短建筑期限、同时提高工程质量、减少经常费，以及降低建筑材料价格等方法，这样来达到。
    要求企业和建筑工程处的经济领导者更加大大注意生产的经济财务问题，要求他们善于把自己在发展技术和组织生产方面的全部活动跟企业在财经方面的成绩结合起来。必须加强财政机关以卢布来经常控制生产和建筑的进程、商品流转、贵重物资积累、企业和经济机关的财经活动。
    斯大林同志说：“糟糕的是我们的经济工作人员和计划工作人员，除了少数的例外，对于价值法则所发生的作用知道得很差，不研究这种作用，不善于在自己的核算中考虑这种作用。”
    党、苏维埃、经济机关、工会和共产主义青年团的各级组织必须动员广大劳动人民群众来完成和超额完成五年计划，对我们组织中的工作缺点展开广泛的布尔什维克式的批评和自我批评，以求尽快消灭这些缺点和改进我们的全部工作。必须以对生产组织中的缺点、对任何浪费和官僚主义现象的不调和精神来教育我们的干部，必须及时地指示和尽力支持经济生活中新的先进的和进步的现象。
    必须保证在完成国民经济计划方面遵守极严格的国家纪律，同时要以党和政府的下列指示为指针：完成国家计划是每个企业的绝对义务。不仅应当在整个总产量方面完成国家计划，而且还要在产品的名目、品种和质量、劳动生产率和产品成本方面完成国家计划。
    新五年计划所提出的任务的实现，要求改进国民经济的计划工作。计划工作的最重要任务，是保证工业和国民经济的各个部门的发展有正确的比例，是揭示和利用使生产增长的内在的潜力。
    第五个五年计划的顺利完成，将使大大增加潜力成为可能。五年计划的指示规定，在五年期间把国家物资和粮食的储备量增加为二倍，以保证国家不遭受任何意外。

    同志们！新五年计划的完成，将是由社会主义到共产主义的发展道路上前进一大步。
    斯大林的各个五年计划一向具有重大的国际意义。斯大林同志在说明第一个五年计划总结时指出：“在我国经济建设的道路上，无论那一个步骤，大概都没有像五年计划及其发展和实现问题那样在欧、美、亚三大洲资本主义国家各种各样的阶层中，遇到如此深刻的反应。”
    我们的五年计划向全世界表明：社会主义具有伟大的生命力，社会主义经济制度较之资本主义经济制度具有根本的优越性。新五年计划规定大大发展国民经济各部门的生产并使它们的技术进步，进一步提高苏联人民的物质福利和文化水平；新五年计划它鲜明地反映了社会主义基本经济法则和国民经济有计划发展法则的要求。社会主义基本经济法则的主要特点和要求，正如斯大林同志教导我们的，就是用在高度技术基础上使社会主义生产不断增长和不断完善的办法，来保证最大限度地满足整个社会经常增长的物质和文化的需要。
    苏联的五年计划——这就是和平的经济和文化建设的计划。这个计划的完成，对于巩固全世界的和平将是新的重大的贡献。新的五年计划所体现的苏联政府的和平政策，是从社会主义制度与资本主义制度可以和平共存这一点出发的，表现了全体苏联人民对于和平不可动摇的信念，并且完全符合世界各国劳动人民的根本利益。
    新五年计划将帮助进一步巩固和扩大苏联与各人民民主国家间的经济合作和兄弟团结，发展跟所有愿意根据平等互利原则发展贸易的各个国家的经济关系。
    新五年计划提高了苏联的国际威信。世界各国亿万的人们愈来愈相信社会主义社会制度的优越性，相信苏联的爱好和平与发展各国人民友好关系的政策的优越性。
    第十九次党代表大会关于第五个五年计划的指示草案的公布，在一切国家中毫无例外地引起了极大的兴趣和热烈的反应。全世界劳动人民热烈地欢迎旨在和平经济建设和进一步提高人民物质福利的新的斯大林五年计划。
    在苏联，关于第五个五年计划的指示草案得到了各级党组织、工人阶级、农民和知识分子普遍的赞许。苏联劳动人民在进一步迅速发展社会主义经济和文化以走向共产主义的计划鼓舞之下，用卓越的生产成绩迎接了党的代表大会。在一九五二年的九个月当中，与去年同一时期比较，苏联工业总产量增加了百分之十二点五，国民经济基本投资总额增加了百分之十五，铁路每昼夜的平均运输量增加了百分之十。谷物已经得到了丰收，技术作物、蔬菜和马铃薯的丰收工作即将结束。
    各级党组织，以及个别党员和非党同志在讨论关于五年计划的指示草案时，提出了很多的意见和补充。提出来的意见，绝大部分都是依据这个或那个州、边区、共和国经济发展的任务和特点，或者是适应于国民经济的个别部门，而把指示草案加以具体化。
    有些人建议增加这个或那个工业部门的生产，把发展农业和运输业的任务定得确切些，建设某些州、边区、共和国所需要的工业企业、电站、铁路和公路。
    例如，乌克兰的同志们提出了在查波罗什建设煤炭选矿工厂、火力发电站的问题；列宁格勒的同志们提议建筑水力发电站；有些人建议在克里沃罗什建筑新的输送电力的线路和变电所，在杜加瓦河修建水电站等等。
    有许多提议是为了把新技术的采用、繁重劳动的机械化的任务定得确切些。有许多建议是关于改善劳动组织，培养干部，改善文化机关、科学机关、卫生机关的工作的。
    上面所说的一切建议，都充满着对完成和超额完成第五个五年计划的关心，反映了各级党组织在经济建设方面所积累的丰富经验，反映了我们干部的成长，并且对于五年计划具有重大的意义。
    因为关于五年计划的指示只应当给国民经济规定基本任务，不能做出详细的规定，所以各级党组织、个别党员和非党同志的这一切把指示草案加以具体化的建议，在我们根据第十九次党代表大会的指示编制五年计划时，将加以适当研究和采用。
    但是，在最后制定指示草案时，应该做某些修正。例如，在工业方面适当地指出发展机器制造业的自动机械，在农业方面适当地指出发展养蚕业和养蜂业，在邮电方面适当地指出展开无线电化，在劳动方面适当地指出实行改善劳动保护和保健条件的办法。
    在各人民民主国家，关于第五个五年计划的指示草案，也引起了劳动人民的政治积极性和生产积极性的高涨，加强了对苏联经济建设的关怀。苏联的经济建设是走上了社会主义和民主道路的各国人民的榜样。各新民主主义国家的劳动人民满意地接受了进一步提高苏联经济实力的五年计划。他们把它看成全世界和平的可靠保证和进一步加强并扩大苏联同各人民民主国家的经济联系的现实前提。各人民民主国家的工人和农民，为了庆祝第十九次党代表大会，纷纷承担了完成和超额完成自己的五年计划的义务。
    五年计划所规定的进一步提高人民生活水平的计划，使各资本主义国家的由于资本主义经济日益军事化而愈益贫困的劳动人民产生了很深刻的印象。他们一天比一天更加确信：只有在社会主义制度下，和平的劳动与全社会的福利才有可能。
    所有的资产阶级报纸对于苏联新五年计划都给予了巨大的注意。如果说资产阶级报刊对于前几个五年计划照例抱着怀疑态度，许多资产阶级活动家甚至认为第四个五年计划没有美国贷款就不可能完成，那末现在，由于苏联计划的完成而获得的确定无疑的成绩，资产阶级舆论界已不再认为这个五年计划是不现实的了。把这点指出来，是很有意思的。第五个五年计划再次辉煌地证实了苏联政府的和平政策，给了战争挑拨者以严重的打击。正因为如此，所以反动的资产阶级报纸用一连串的谎言和诽谤来攻击关于第五个五年计划的指示草案，拚命向人民群众掩盖五年计划的和平性质，硬说它具有侵略的目的和任务。
    斯大林同志已经阐明：与扩展民用工业，进行大规模的民用建设和有系统地降低日用品价格同时，还要增加武装力量和扩展军事工业，是不可能的。散布苏联有侵略意图的谣言，是为了使各资本主义国家的劳动人民陷入迷途，硬要他们相信关于苏联的谎言，并用欺骗手段把他们拖进美国反动集团正在组织的新的世界大战。但是，苏联劳动人民物质福利的不断提高与和平国民经济部门和文化的发展，各资本主义国家劳动人民每况愈下的状况和军国主义的发展，都揭穿了资产阶级所宣传的这个粗暴的谎言。
    同志们！也和前几个五年计划一样，新五年计划的鼓舞者是我们的领袖和导师斯大林同志。（鼓掌）
    在代表大会开幕前，斯大林同志新的著作“苏联社会主义经济问题”发表了，它以社会主义经济法则的知识，以在苏联建成共产主义的理论，以国民经济计划科学基础的知识，来武装了我们党。
    苏联人民正以生产积极性新的蓬勃高涨，以全民争取第五个斯大林五年计划胜利的社会主义竞赛新的蓬勃高涨，来迎接根据党和政府的指示而制订的五年计划。
    苏联人民将不惜力量来保证新五年计划的顺利完成和超额完成。紧紧团结在共产党周围，团结在自己敬爱的领袖和导师伟大斯大林周围，苏联人民正满怀信心地向共产主义前进。（长时间的鼓掌）
