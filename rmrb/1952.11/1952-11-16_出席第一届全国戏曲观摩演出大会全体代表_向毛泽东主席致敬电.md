To the respected Chairman Mao:

We report to you with boundless excitement: The First National Opera Performance and Observation Conference has concluded successfully today under your lofty concern. Following the correct policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, weed through the old to bring forth the new" that you have indicated, the national opera circles have made some preliminary achievements in recent years. This opera performance and observation conference, sponsored by the Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government, has given us the opportunity to observe and learn from each other. The awards given at the conference to outstanding plays and outstanding actors are a great encouragement to opera workers across the country. We guarantee that we will work even harder under your leadership in the future and strive for progress in order to serve the people more effectively. Respected Chairman Mao, we thank you wholeheartedly! We wish you boundless longevity!
