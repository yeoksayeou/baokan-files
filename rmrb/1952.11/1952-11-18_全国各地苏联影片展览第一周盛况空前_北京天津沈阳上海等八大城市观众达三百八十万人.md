Xinhua News Agency, November 17th: The Soviet film exhibition in sixty-seven cities across the country has been a resounding success. In the first week, from November 7th to 13th, statistics from only eight major cities—Beijing, Tianjin, Shenyang, Shanghai, Wuhan, Guangzhou, Chongqing, and Xi'an—showed that the audience number reached 3.8 million. The audience in small and medium-sized cities was also extremely enthusiastic. In the northeastern region, the twenty cities (excluding Shenyang) holding Soviet film exhibitions had already attracted more than 1.78 million viewers by the 13th. The Fuxin mining area, which is holding a Soviet film exhibition, bought three new projectors because the original ones were not enough. Within a few days, three temporary large cinemas appeared in this mining area. In order to allow workers to watch Soviet films well, the three cinemas in Anshan specially installed new generators. Many places also sent large numbers of film projection teams to tour mines, rural areas, and remote areas, so that mine workers, farmers, and minority people could see the latest Soviet films.

The broad masses of people deeply love Soviet films. The cinemas in major cities screen films six or seven times a day, and even more on Sundays. Many cinemas adopt the method of "machines don't rest even if people do," screening films in the early morning and at noon. The fourteen cinemas in Tianjin are full every day. The Heping Cinema showed eleven consecutive screenings from 5:00 AM to 2:00 AM one day, and every screening was fully seated. Some cinemas have even sold out tickets for the end of the month. In the Tiexi and Huanggu industrial districts of Shenyang, dark crowds line up in front of the cinemas every day before dawn, waiting in the freezing cold to watch the first film screening at 5 o'clock. More than 1,000 workers from the Jinan Industrial Construction Company's kiln braved the rain to travel more than ten miles to the city to watch movies. Students from the Wangcheng County Middle School in Hunan Province traveled fifty miles to Changsha to reserve tickets at the cinema and traveled a long way to watch Soviet films. The enthusiasm of the broad masses of farmers and housewives for watching Soviet films is also extremely high. In the suburbs of Shanghai, 130,000 farmers have already watched Soviet films. More than 3,000 farmers in the suburbs of Jiamusi City, who had never seen a movie before, went to the city to watch the Soviet film "A Bright Summer." There were also more than 600 farmers in the suburbs of Guiyang who collectively went to the city to watch movies. Housewives in cities such as Shenyang and Chengdu have organized temporary nurseries so that women with children can also watch movies.

People regard watching Soviet films as an opportunity to receive socialist education. Workers and students in cities such as Wuhan, Guangzhou, Nanjing, and Chongqing generally held seminars after watching the films to talk about their experiences and feelings. The workers of the 405 Coal Mine of the Southwest Industrial Department saw their own future in the film "Donbass Miners." Pu Feiyun, a model worker of the mine, said: "This film shows ourselves. I firmly believe that under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, our mine will soon be mechanized like the Donbass coal mine." Li Hengfu, a worker at the Jinan Power Plant, was greatly encouraged by the great dedication of the protagonist of "Gold Star Hero," Serazhe. He said: "I must learn from Serazhe's spirit and work hard. Our power industry workers must popularize our country's electrical industry to every mine, factory, and rural area like the Soviet Union." Newspapers in Kunming, Qingdao, Xiamen, and other places have received many letters from readers, narrating the education that Soviet films have given them. After watching "A Bright Summer," farmers in various places were also deeply moved by the abundant harvests and happy lives of the Soviet collective farms.

    全国各地苏联影片展览第一周盛况空前
    北京天津沈阳上海等八大城市观众达三百八十万人
    【新华社十七日讯】全国六十七个城市的苏联影片展览盛况空前，从七日开始到十三日为止的第一周中，仅据北京、天津、沈阳、上海、武汉、广州、重庆、西安八大城市的统计，观众人数就达三百八十万人。中小城市的观众也极为踊跃，东北区举行苏联影片展览的二十个城市（沈阳除外）到十三日为止，各界观众已达一百七十八万多人。举行苏联影片展览的阜新市矿区因为原有放映机不够用，便新买了三部放映机，这个矿区在几天之内就出现了三座临时性的大影院。鞍山市的三家电影院为了使工人们能够很好地看苏联影片，特地装置了新的发电机。许多地方并派出大批电影放映队到矿山、农村和边远地区去巡回放映，使矿区工人、农民和少数民族人民都能看到最新的苏联影片。
    广大人民十分热爱苏联影片。各大城市的电影院每天都要放映六、七场，星期日放映的场数更多，有不少电影院采取人歇机不歇的办法，在清晨和中午都放映电影。天津市十四家电影院天天客满，和平电影院有一天从清晨五时起到深夜二时止连演十一场，场场满座。有的电影院连月底的票也已卖完。沈阳市铁西、皇姑两工业区的电影院门口，每天黎明前就排着黑压压的行列，人们在凛冽的寒风中等着看五点钟放映的第一场电影。济南市实业建筑公司窑厂一千多工人从十几里以外冒雨赶到城里看电影。湖南省望城县县立中学的学生从五十里以外跑到长沙市向电影院定好座券，远道赶去看苏联影片。广大农民及家庭妇女们观看苏联影片的情绪也极热烈。上海市郊区已有十三万农民看过苏联电影。佳木斯市郊区从来没有看过电影的三千多个农民，这次进城看了苏联影片“明朗的夏天”。贵阳市郊区也有六百多个农民集体进城看电影。沈阳、成都等市的家庭妇女都组织了临时托儿所，使得有孩子牵累的妇女也看上了电影。
    人们把看苏联影片当作是接受社会主义教育的机会。武汉、广州、南京、重庆等城市的工人、学生，看完电影后普遍地举行座谈会，漫谈自己的体会和感想。西南工业部四○五煤矿工人们从“顿巴斯矿工”这一影片中看到了自己的前途，该矿劳动模范蒲飞云说：“这部片子表现的就是我们自己，我深信在毛主席和共产党的领导下，我们的矿很快就会像顿巴斯煤矿一样实现机械化。”济南市发电厂工人李衡富从“金星英雄”的主角——谢拉杰的伟大事业精神中得到了很大的鼓舞，他说：我一定要学习谢拉杰的精神去努力工作，我们电业工人要把我们祖国的电气事业像苏联那样普及到每个矿山、工厂和农村中去。昆明、青岛、厦门等地的报纸收到许多读者的来信，叙说苏联电影对他们的教育。各地农民看过“明朗的夏天”后；也都深深地被苏联集体农庄的丰盛收获和幸福生活所感动。
