The Soviet people, based on years of experience, are convinced that the Communist Party has no interests higher than the interests of the people. The Party of Lenin and Stalin, both in the past and present, has tirelessly struggled for the common happiness of the people, for the joy of all laborers and the millions of masses.

Under the leadership of the Communist Party, the Soviet people have long since and forever freed themselves from the misfortunes of the capitalist system, and were the first in the world to establish a socialist society where there are no exploiters, and the working people work for themselves and their country. Thanks to the great revolutionary reforms and the implementation of Stalin's several five-year plans, a new socialist economy has been established in our country. Our country has no crises and unemployment, no poverty and bankruptcy. The state provides citizens with every possibility to enjoy a prosperous and cultural life.

Comrade Stalin said: "Only our revolution not only broke the shackles of capitalism, not only gave the people freedom, but also gave the people the material conditions to enjoy an abundant life. This is the reason why the strength of our revolution is strong and invincible."

The lives of the Soviet working people have been constantly improving along with the vigorous development of Soviet industry and agriculture. Various issues related to improving the people's happiness are always the focus of the Party's attention. In the post-war period, that is, during the Fourth Five-Year Plan, according to Comrade Stalin's instructions, special attention was paid to expanding the production of consumer goods and improving the living standards of the working people by gradually lowering the prices of all commodities.

As is well known, the Fourth Five-Year Plan demonstrated remarkable achievements in both the development of industrial and agricultural production, and the improvement of people's happiness and culture. In 1950, the national income of the Soviet Union, calculated at comparable prices, increased by 64 percent compared to 1940, while the total income of workers and staff and the income of farmers rose by 62 percent.

The draft directives of the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party regarding the Fifth Five-Year Plan for the Development of the Soviet Union from 1951 to 1955 stipulate a new, powerful upsurge in the national economy and a further significant improvement in the material well-being and cultural level of the people.

The Communist Party considers constantly improving the material and cultural level of society as one of its main tasks. The most comprehensive and vivid indicator of the high rise in the material happiness of our working masses is the increase in national income. While in capitalist countries more than half of the national income is seized by the bourgeoisie, the entire national income of the Soviet Union belongs to the working people. The distribution of our national income is for the benefit of systematically improving the material conditions of workers, peasants, and intellectuals, and expanding socialist production. The increase in national income leads to an increase in the income of the working people.

The draft directives of the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party on the Fifth Five-Year Plan stipulate the following task:

"On the basis of a steady increase in socialist production and an increase in social labor productivity, to increase the national income of the Soviet Union by at least 60 percent during the five years; thereby ensuring a further increase in the income of workers and staff and the income of farmers."

Unemployment has long ceased to exist in the Soviet Union. The complete elimination of unemployment is one of the historically significant achievements of our country in the struggle to improve the material conditions of the working people. The number of workers and staff in the sectors of the Soviet national economy is constantly increasing. This number was 39.2 million at the end of 1950, an increase of 7.7 million compared to 1940. In the past year alone, the number of employees increased by 1.6 million. In the new five-year plan, in accordance with the growth of production scale and labor productivity, as well as the tasks of cultural construction, the number of employees is planned to increase by approximately 15 percent compared to 1950.

The Communist Party is doing everything possible to more fully and better meet the growing demands of the working people. The Party of Lenin and Stalin, which inspires the Soviet people to realize the plans for communist construction, is pursuing a policy of continuously improving the overall happiness of the people and gradually reducing the prices of consumer goods.

In the post-war years, the Soviet Union has reduced retail prices of consumer goods five times. Every Soviet family and every Soviet person has felt the beneficial effects of this measure. Prices will continue to fall. The draft directives of the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party say:

"In view of the fact that price reduction is the main means of systematically increasing the real wages of workers and staff and the income of farmers, it is necessary to continue to continuously reduce the retail prices of consumer goods."

The draft directives stipulate that in the new five-year plan, by reducing retail prices, the real wages of workers and staff should be increased by at least 35 percent, and the cash and in-kind income of collective farmers should be increased by at least 40 percent.

Due to further price reductions and a significant increase in the real wages of workers and the income of farmers, the purchasing power of residents will be further improved. In five years, retail trade in state-owned and cooperative commerce will increase by about 70 percent. The most important commodities sold to residents must be increased significantly. Thus, in the final year of the Fifth Five-Year Plan, the planned sales volume of commodities should increase compared to 1950: meat products by 90 percent, fish products and butter by 70 percent, cheese, vegetable oil, and sugar by two times, clothing and footwear by 80 percent, textiles by 70 percent, and furniture by three times.

The Soviet state constantly cares about further improving the living conditions of the working people. The draft directives of the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party stipulate that in the new five-year plan, a large-scale national housing construction plan should be implemented. Basic investment in this area is about twice that of the Fourth Five-Year Plan. New residences to be completed in various cities and workers' residential areas, solely in accordance with the state construction guidelines, will have a total area of approximately 105 million square meters. In addition, private housing will be assisted in various cities and workers' residential areas by relying on their own funding and national loan assistance.

In the new five-year plan, some important measures will be implemented in the field of health. Our country will establish more hospitals, sanatoriums, and rest homes, will significantly expand the number of doctors, and increase the production of medical equipment, instruments, the latest medicines, and other effective tools for treating and preventing diseases. The path to new achievements is being opened up in front of the health cause of the Soviet Union.

The Fifth Five-Year Plan is a plan for peaceful economic and cultural construction that will further increase the happiness of the Soviet people. This plan once again shows the great vitality of socialism to the world and the essential superiority of the socialist system over the capitalist system. The peaceful development of the Soviet economy as planned in the Five-Year Plan is in contrast to the economies of various capitalist countries, which are moving towards militarizing the national economy, earning the highest profits for capitalists, and further impoverishing the working people.

The magnificent plan for the further powerful upsurge of the national economy and the improvement of the people's material well-being and cultural level, as listed in the draft directives of the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party, inspires the Soviet people to engage in selfless labor and achieve new production victories for the glory of the beloved motherland and the victory of communism.

    苏联人民幸福的增长
    ——苏联“真理报”九月十日社论
    苏联人根据多年的经验确信共产党没有高于人民利益的利益。列宁—斯大林的党无论过去和现在，都为人民的共同的幸福，为全体劳动者和千百万群众的欢乐而进行不倦的斗争。
    在共产党领导下，苏联人民早已永远摆脱了资本主义制度的灾祸，在世界上首先建立了社会主义的社会，这里没有剥削者，劳动人民是为自己和自己的国家而工作。由于伟大的革命性的改革和斯大林的几个五年计划的实施，在我国建立了新的社会主义经济。我国没有危机和失业，没有贫穷和破产。国家给予公民们以享受富裕生活和文化生活的一切可能。
    斯大林同志说：“只有我国革命才不仅打破了资本主义的枷锁，不仅给予了人民自由而且给予了人民享受丰裕生活的物质条件。我国革命力量雄厚而不可战胜的原因就在于此。”
    苏联劳动人民的生活伴随着苏联工业和农业的蓬勃发展，一直在不断地改善。提高人民幸福的各种问题永远是党的注意的中心。在战后时期，即第四个五年计划期间，根据斯大林同志的指示，对于扩大消费品的产额和用逐步降低一切商品价格的方法来提高劳动人民的生活水平方面，曾予以特殊的注意。
    如所周知，第四个五年计划无论在工农业生产的发展方面，或人民幸福和文化的提高方面，都表现了卓越的成就。一九五○年苏联的国民收入，照比较价格计算，比一九四○年增加百分之六十四，而职工的收入和农民的收入总额则上升了百分之六十二。
    党的第十九次代表大会关于一九五一年——一九五五年苏联发展第五个五年计划的指示草案规定了国民经济的新的强有力的高涨和人民物质幸福和文化水平的进一步显著提高。
    共产党认为不断地提高社会的物质和文化水平是它的主要任务之一。我国劳动大众物质幸福高涨的最具有概括性的鲜明指标，便是国民收入的增加。当资本主义国家中半数以上的国民收入是由资产阶级所攫有时，苏联的全部国民收入却是属于劳动人民的。我们的国民收入的分配，是为了有计划地改善工人、农民、知识分子的物质状况和扩大社会主义生产的利益的。国民收入的增多导向劳动人民收入的提高。
    党的第十九次代表大会关于第五个五年计划的指示草案中规定有这样一项任务：
    “在社会主义生产的稳步增加和社会劳动生产率提高的基础上，在五年期间使苏联的国民收入至少增加百分之六十；由此保证进一步增加职工的收入以及农民的收入。”
    苏联早已没有了失业现象。完全消灭失业现象是我国在争取提高劳动人民物质状况的斗争中具有历史意义的成果之一。苏联国民经济部门中职工的人数在不断地增加着。这一数字在一九五○年底是三千九百二十万人，比一九四○年增加七百七十万人。仅在过去的一年当中，职工人数便增加了一百六十万人。在新的五年计划中，依照生产规模和劳动生产率的增长，以及文化建设方面的任务，职工人数规定要比一九五○年增加约百分之十五。
    共产党正在做一切工作以求更充分和更好地满足劳动人民增长着的要求。鼓舞着苏联人实现共产主义建设计划的列宁—斯大林的党，进行着不断提高人民总的幸福的政策和逐步降低消费品价格的政策。
    在战后的年代中，苏联曾五次降低消费品的零售价格。每一个苏联的家庭，每个苏联人都感觉到这
    一措施的良好效果。价格还要继续降低。党的第十九次代表大会的指示草案说：
    “鉴于减价是有系统地提高职工的实际工资以及农民的收入的主要手段，因此要继续不断减低消费品的零售价格”。
    指示草案规定在新的五年计划中以减低零售价格的方法，至少要提高职工的实际工资百分之三十五，把集体农民的现金收入和实物收入至少增加百分之四十。
    由于价格的进一步降低，由于职工实际工资和农民收入的显著增加，居民的购买力将更为提高。在五年中，增大国营和合作社商业的零售贸易约百分之七十。售给居民的最重要的商品必须增加许多。这样，在第五个五年计划的最后一年，规定商品的出售量要比一九五○年增加：肉类产品百分之九十，鱼类产品和牛油百分之七十，乳酪、植物油和糖增为两倍，服装和鞋类百分之八十，纺织品百分之七十，家具增为三倍。
    苏维埃国家经常关怀着进一步改善劳动人民的居住条件。党的第十九次代表大会的指示草案规定在新的五年计划中要实施一个国家大规模建造房屋的计划。在这方面的基本投资约为第四个五年计划的两倍。仅是依照国家建设方针，在各城市和工人居住区将要落成的新的住宅，其总面积即达一亿零五百万平方公尺左右。此外，并将在各城市和工人住宅区，以依靠自己出资和国家贷款帮助的方式协助修建私人住宅。
    在新的五年计划中，在卫生事业方面将实现一些重要的措施。我国将设立更多的医院、疗养院和休养所，将显著地扩大医生人数，增加医疗设备、器械、最新式药品和其他有效治病、防病的工具的生产。在苏联的卫生事业面前开辟着走向新成绩的道路。
    第五个五年计划是使苏联人的幸福进一步高涨的和平的经济和文化建设的计划。这个计划重新向全世界显示了社会主义的伟大生活力，社会主义制度对资本主义制度的本质上的优越性。五年计划所拟定的苏联经济的和平发展是与各资本主义国家的经济相对立的，这些国家正在走向使国民经济军国主义化、为资本家赚取最高利润和使劳动人民进一步贫穷的道路。
    党的第十九次代表大会的指示草案所列述的国民经济进一步强有力高涨、人民的物质幸福和文化水平提高的宏伟计划，鼓舞着苏联人为亲爱的祖国的光荣和共产主义胜利而进行忘我的劳动和取得新的生产胜利。
