    Our Great Motherland
    The No. 3 Plant of the state-owned Shanghai Iron and Steel Company has successfully trial-produced small-sized killed steel upon adopting the suggestion of Soviet expert Gimitov. This has not only improved output and quality and reduced costs, but also enhanced our country's smelting technology. These are the batches of killed steel ingots that the plant has already produced.
