Readers Offer Opinions on the Handling of the Songzailing Incident in Enping County, Guangdong

Editor's Note: After the publication of the report "Guangdong Enping County Cadres Shielding Landlords in Murdering Peasants Case Seriously Handled, Former Public Security Bureau Chief Feng Hanying and Court Vice President Wu Lang Executed by Firing Squad, Former County Head Zheng Dingnuo Sentenced to Five Years Imprisonment" on page three of this newspaper on August 12th, readers sent letters to this newspaper expressing their opinions (more than fifty letters were received, some jointly written, or written in the name of a unit). The opinions of the readers, summarized, can be roughly divided into the following aspects: 1. They believe that the five-year sentence for Zheng Dingnuo is too light, and suggest a re-sentence. The reasons are: First, after the liberation of Enping County, Zheng Dingnuo not only released sixteen people, including the puppet county head, puppet brigade commander, Kuomintang secretary, and major despots, but also appointed a number of counter-revolutionaries as government cadres, including the former puppet commissioner's conscription section chief and major despots who insisted on an anti-people stance. This shows that Zheng Dingnuo is a class alien who has planned to infiltrate the revolutionary ranks. Second, when individual landlords in the third district of Enping County were struggled against, Zheng Dingnuo actually went to "comfort" them. When the landlords launched the construction of the so-called "People's Hall" with tens of billions of yuan, he forced the peasants to contribute money; but he ignored the serious problem of peasants having no food to eat during the spring famine. This shows that Zheng Dingnuo is completely standing on the side of the landlord class, faithfully serving the landlord class. Third, Zheng Dingnuo agreed to the arrest of peasants He Zhaoting, He Rong, and others; later, the county people's court illegally sentenced these eight people to death and long-term imprisonment, and Zheng Dingnuo was aware of all this. Therefore, Zheng Dingnuo should also bear direct responsibility for this murder of peasants case. Based on the above reasons, the sentence of Zheng Dingnuo should be re-judged. 2. When this murder of peasants case was reported to the Guangdong Provincial People's Court Yuezhong Branch for review, trial judge Lin Xibo arbitrarily added unfounded charges such as "cruel and insidious murder methods, serious maliciousness" to He Zhaoting and others, believing that "they should be sentenced to death." Xie Chuang (Commissioner), who was also the president of the branch, shamefully approved "Agreed." Later, Lin Xibo illegally deprived He Zhaoting, He Zhaozhen, and He Rong of their right to appeal, and allowed the Enping County Third District People's Government to execute He Zhaoting and others. Therefore, Lin Xibo and Xie Chuang should also be responsible for the death sentences of He Zhaoting and others, and should also be punished. But we don't know how Lin Xibo and Xie Chuang were dealt with? 3. Liang Bing, a public security officer of the Enping County Third District People's Government, and other bad elements, once falsely accused the peasants of the production team led by He Zhaoting of killing the landlord Feng Qunzhong, and conspired with Feng Hanying to murder the peasants. Therefore, these bad elements should also bear direct responsibility for the murder of peasants He Zhaoting and others, and should be punished by law. – We don’t know how these people were dealt with? 4. We hope to know how the landlords and despots who framed the peasants were dealt with. 5. We hope to know how the families of the victimized peasants were compensated. The above opinions of the readers have been sent to the relevant authorities such as the South China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee for research. The following is the reply from the General Office of the South China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee.

### 读者对广东恩平县松仔岭事件的处理提出意见

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    读者对广东恩平县松仔岭事件的处理提出意见
    编者按：八月十二日本报第三版刊载“广东恩平县干部包庇地主杀害农民案已作严肃处理，前公安局长冯汉英法院副院长吴朗被枪决，前县长郑鼎诺被判处五年徒刑”的报道后，读者纷纷给本报来信提出意见（先后计收到此项来信五十多件，内中有数人联名写的，或用单位名义写的）。读者们的意见，综合起来，较重要的约分这样几方面：一、认为对郑鼎诺判五年徒刑太轻，建议重作判处。理由是：第一、郑鼎诺在恩平县解放后，不仅放走了伪县长、伪大队长、国民党书记长和大恶霸等十六人，而且引用了若干反革命分子充当人民政府干部，其中有坚持反人民立场的伪专署兵役科长、大恶霸等。这说明郑鼎诺是阶级异己分子，是有计划地混入革命阵营。第二、恩平县三区有个别地主被斗，郑鼎诺竟前往“慰问”。地主发起用十几亿元建筑所谓“人民会堂”，他强迫农民出钱；但对春荒期间农民没饭吃的严重问题，却不加理睬。这说明郑鼎诺是十足地站在地主阶级立场，忠实地为地主阶级服务。第三、农民何兆廷、何荣等八人之被逮捕，郑鼎诺是同意了的；后来，该县人民法院非法判处这八人死刑和长期徒刑，郑鼎诺都是知道的。所以这杀害农民案件，郑鼎诺也应该负直接责任。根据以上理由，应该对郑鼎诺的罪刑重作判处。二、这一杀害农民案报请广东省人民法院粤中分院审核时，审判员林西伯任意给何兆廷等加上“杀人手段残酷阴险，恶性重大”等莫须有的罪名，认为
    “理应判处死刑”。该分院兼院长谢创（专员）也可耻地批了“同意”。后来，林西伯又非法地剥夺了何兆廷、何兆桢、何荣三人的上诉权，让恩平县三区人民政府把何兆廷等三人执行了死刑。所以何兆廷等三人的被判死刑，林西伯、谢创也应该负责任，也应该受处分。但不知对林西伯、谢创作何处理？三、恩平县三区人民政府公安员梁炳和其他坏分子，曾经诬告何兆廷领导的生产小组的农民杀害了地主冯群忠，和冯汉英一起密谋杀害农民。所以，这些坏分子对农民何兆廷等被害也应该负直接责任，并受法律处分。——不知对这些人作何处理？四、希望知道对陷害农民的地主恶霸是如何处理的。五、希望知道对受害农民的家属是如何抚恤的。以上读者们的意见，当经本报送请中共中央华南分局等有关机关研究。下面是中共中央华南分局办公厅的答复。
