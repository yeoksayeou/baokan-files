Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 13th (TASS): Deutsche Communications Agency reported: The German Communist Party issued a program for restoring German national unity.

The program pointed out: Under the enslavement rule of the United States, Britain, and France, the people of West Germany are in dire straits. American imperialism is not only enslaving, plundering, and humiliating the people of West Germany, but also wants to drag West Germany into a new war of aggression they are preparing. To this end, American imperialism is stepping up the establishment of a German mercenary army.

The program emphasized: The Adenauer puppet regime, like the United States, Britain, and France, is attempting to obstruct Germany's unification and peace. It is the enemy of people's rights and democracy. If the people of West Germany want to survive, they must overthrow the Adenauer regime in order to establish a government that can be supported by all patriotic forces in West Germany to strive for the restoration of national unity.

The program continued: The main obstacles to Germany's unity, peace, and independence are the "General Treaty" and the Paris war agreements, which must be eliminated. The urgent goals of the German people must be: concluding a peace treaty, holding all-German elections to seek the unification of Germany, and withdrawing the occupying forces.

The program then pointed out: In the struggle for national liberation, the alliance formed by the working class and West German farmers, which accounts for more than half of the population of West Germany, is an indestructible force. This is the only force that can guarantee the victory of the cause of Germany's reunification. The program said: Because this struggle is in line with the most fundamental interests of the people of all other strata in West Germany, West German staff and civil servants, freelancers, technicians and small merchants, small and medium-sized business owners, and a large number of West German industrialists and businessmen will participate in the alliance of the working class and farmers. These are the majority of people who do not like war and war production, and their survival has been threatened by the Western occupying authorities and Adenauer's war policy. All progressive people in West Germany, regardless of their social status and worldview, will participate in this alliance, because they all demand German unity, freedom, and independence, and continuous development in economy and culture. Therefore, it is necessary to establish mutual understanding among all patriots, among all good people in West and East Germany, and organize them to take joint action.

The program exposed that the right-wing leaders of the West German Social Democratic Party and trade unions actually maintain the foundation of the current West German regime and hinder the road to German national unification. They have betrayed the interests of the working class and the nation. The program called on all German Social Democratic workers, Communist workers, Christian Democratic Union workers, and all working people to take joint action to strive for the realization of their national and social demands.

The program pointed out: In the struggle for national unity and peace, the people of West Germany have received the warm support of the people of the German Democratic Republic, and have won the deep sympathy and friendship of all peace-loving people in the world, which is clearly manifested in the proposition of the great socialist Soviet Union. The Soviet Union has always insisted that Germany must obtain complete national independence, equality, and unrestricted peaceful economic development. The current movement for a peaceful settlement of the German issue, which is widely carried out throughout the world, is proof of the great support for the German people's liberation movement.

The program put forward the goals of the West German national liberation struggle:

	One, restore Germany's unity and make it a unified, democratic, peace-loving, and independent country, and conclude a peace treaty with Germany. The program advocates: West Germany and East Germany should reach an agreement immediately so as to hold all-German free elections without delay and establish a National Assembly; West Germany and East Germany jointly request the early conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany and the withdrawal of all occupying forces to end the division of Germany; in order to defend their independence, their peaceful labor, and their territory, the German people have the right to establish their national armed forces; the German people oppose participating in military alliances against other countries; pursue a diplomatic policy that defends peace and strengthens international friendship.

	Two, guarantee the democratic freedom of the German people. The program proposes: abolish all laws and regulations that restrict the democratic freedom of the German people; guarantee all democratic rights and freedoms by law; prohibit and punish war propaganda, racial hatred propaganda, and propaganda that incites mutual hostility among nations; militarist and fascist organizations must be dissolved.

	Three, freely develop Germany's peaceful economy. The program advocates: abolish all restrictions on the development of Germany's peaceful economy, encourage and guarantee the development of the peaceful economy in various ways; confiscate the enterprises of large Konzerns, the enterprises of the mining industry and metallurgical industry, large chemical plants, large banks, large insurance companies, and the enterprises whose factory owners support the Adenauer regime that sells out the nation, and make them the property of the people; the phenomenon of foreign capital, especially American capital, controlling the West German economy must be eliminated; in order to guarantee the food supply for the people and improve agricultural production, land should be distributed fairly, and all real estate exceeding one hundred hectares should be distributed to poor and hired peasants.

	Four, social principles. The program advocates: improve people's lives, broadly develop the peaceful economy and foreign trade, eliminate unemployment, formulate social relief regulations, guarantee women's equal rights, build houses, and improve people's living conditions.

	Five, develop science and culture. The program advocates: restore the destroyed cultural and educational facilities, restore the freedom of scientific research, and vigorously develop education and culture.

The program finally called on all patriotic people in Germany, especially workers and farmers, to bravely and confidently unite within the National Front of Democratic Germany and strive to achieve these goals.

    德共发表争取恢复全德统一纲领
    号召全体爱国人民团结在民主德国全国阵线之内，为
    实现西德民族解放斗争目标而奋斗
    【新华社十五日讯】据塔斯社柏林十三日讯：德意志通讯社报道：德国共产党发表一项争取恢复德国全国统一的纲领。
    纲领指出：在美、英、法的奴役统治下，西德人民正处于水深火热之中。美帝国主义不仅在奴役、掠夺和侮辱西德人民，而且还想把西德拖进他们正在准备的新的侵略战争中去。为此，美帝国主义正在加紧建立一支德国雇佣军。
    纲领着重指出：阿登纳傀儡政权和美、英、法一样，企图阻挠德国的统一与和平。它是人民权利和民主的敌人。西德人民假使要生存，就必需推翻阿登纳政权，以便成立一个可以得到西德一切爱国力量支持的争取恢复全国统一的政府。
    纲领继续说：目前德国统一、和平与独立的主要障碍就是“一般性条约”和巴黎的战争协定，这种障碍必须加以消除。德国人民的迫切目标必须是：缔结和约，举行全德选举以求统一德国和撤退占领军队。
    纲领接着指出：在争取民族解放斗争中，占有西德人口半数以上的工人阶级和西德农民所结成的联盟是一支不可摧毁的力量。这是唯一能够保证德国恢复统一的事业获得胜利的力量。纲领说：由于这个斗争符合西德其他各阶层人民最根本的利益，西德的职员和公务员、自由职业者、技工和小商人、中小企业主和一大部分西德工商业家都将参加工人阶级与农民的联盟，这些人是不喜欢战争和战争生产的大多数人民，他们的生存已经受到西方占领当局和阿登纳的战争政策的威胁。西德一切进步人士，不问他们的社会地位和世界观如何，都将参加这个联盟，因为他们都要求德国统一、自由和独立，在经济上和文化上不断发展。因此，必须在所有爱国人士中间，在所有西德和东德的善良人士中间，建立相互的了解，组织他们联合行动。
    纲领揭露西德社会民主党和工会的右翼头子们实际上维护西德现政权的基础，阻碍德国民族统一的道路。他们已背叛了工人阶级与民族的利益。纲领号召；所有德国社会民主党工人、共产党工人、基督教民主联盟工人以及一切劳动人民采取联合行动，争取实现他们的民族与社会要求。
    纲领指出：西德人民在争取全国统一与和平的斗争中，受到德意志民主共和国人民的热烈支持，并且获得了全世界所有爱好和平的人民的深切同情与友谊，这种友谊明显地表现在伟大的社会主义苏联的主张上。苏联始终坚持德国必须获得完全的民族独立、平等及毫无限制的和平经济发展。目前在全世界普遍开展的争取和平解决德国问题的运动，就是德国人民解放运动得到伟大支援的证明。
    纲领提出了西德民族解放斗争的目标：
    一、恢复德国的统一，使它成为一个统一、民主、爱好和平、独立的国家并缔结对德和约。纲领主张：西德与东德之间立刻达成协议，以便毫不迟延地举行全德自由选举，成立国民议会；西德和东德联合要求早日缔结对德和约并撤退所有占领军队，结束德国的分裂状态；为了保卫他们的独立、他们的和平劳动，他们的领土，德国人民有权建立他们的国家武装部队；德国人民反对参加针对其他国家的军事联盟；奉行保卫和平和加强国际友谊的外交政策。
    二、保证德国人民的民主自由。纲领提出：废除一切限制德国人民民主自由的法律和规定；用法律保障一切民主权利和自由；禁止并惩处战争宣传、种族仇视宣传以及煽动各民族互相敌视的宣传，军国主义和法西斯主义的组织必须解散。
    三、自由发展德国的和平经济。纲领主张：废除对于发展德国和平经济的一切限制，鼓励并以各种办法保证和平经济的发展。没收大康采恩的企业、采矿工业和冶金工业的企业、大化学工厂、大银行、大保险公司以及其厂主支持出卖民族的阿登纳政权的企业，使之成为人民的财产；外国资本特别是美国资本控制西德经济的现象必须消除；为保证民食供应和提高农业生产，应公平分配土地，凡超过一百公顷的地产，一律分给贫雇农。
    四、社会原则。纲领主张：改善人民生活，广泛发展和平经济和对外贸易，消除失业现象，制定社会救济法规，保障妇女的平等权利，修建房屋，改善人民居住条件。
    五、发展科学与文化。纲领主张：修复被毁的文化与教育设备，恢复科学研究的自由，大力发展教育与文化事业。
    纲领最后号召德国全体爱国人民，首先是工人和农民，勇敢而满怀信心地团结在民主德国全国阵线之内，为实现这些目标而奋斗。
