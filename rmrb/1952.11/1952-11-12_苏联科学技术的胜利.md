The successful reinforcement of the Yellow River Iron Bridge is a new victory for the combination of the labor of the Chinese working class and advanced Soviet science and technology.

The Yellow River Iron Bridge was built in 1903. According to the design of bourgeois experts, the warranty period for this bridge was fifteen years. According to this technical specification, the Yellow River Iron Bridge should have been unusable long ago. After the Chinese people took control of the Yellow River Iron Bridge, a bridge inspection team from the Ministry of Railways, with the participation of Soviet experts, conducted an on-site investigation of the Yellow River Iron Bridge in November 1949. They conducted precise research and scientific experiments on the important parts of the Yellow River Iron Bridge. Based on socialist scientific theory, they determined that the Yellow River Iron Bridge could continue to be used, and believed that as long as reinforcement work was carried out and careful maintenance was performed, the load-bearing capacity and driving speed of the Yellow River Iron Bridge could be improved.

The opinions of the Soviet experts were opposed by some engineering and technical personnel at the time. Based on the backward scientific theories of the bourgeoisie, they believed that "continuing to use the Yellow River Iron Bridge is an extremely risky act." After this newspaper published a report in March 1950 on the increased driving speed of the Yellow River Iron Bridge after reinforcement, some engineering and technical personnel still believed: "Although the Yellow River Iron Bridge has been reinforced, the foundation of the Yellow River Iron Bridge cannot be improved in any way." "The Yellow River Iron Bridge is like a centipede floating on the water, and cannot withstand the impact of the Yellow River."

However, the facts refuted the above statements. The reinforced Yellow River Iron Bridge showed no signs of being "unable to withstand the impact of the Yellow River." Today, not only has the "foundation" of the Yellow River Iron Bridge been improved, but large locomotives can travel at a speed of 45 kilometers per hour on the Yellow River Iron Bridge, and can pull 2,000 tons of cargo at a time.

This fact shows that Soviet socialist science and technology is far superior to capitalist science and technology, and that the combination of the labor of the Chinese working class and the advanced experience of the Soviet Union will inevitably produce great achievements. It also shows that engineering and technical personnel must earnestly carry out ideological transformation and humbly learn from the Soviet Union. They should once again recognize the superiority of Soviet science and technology from the successful fact of the Yellow River Iron Bridge reinforcement project, so as to establish the idea of ​​"leaning to one side" in science and technology to welcome the country's large-scale economic construction.

### 苏联科学技术的胜利

    苏联科学技术的胜利
    黄河铁桥加固工程的成功，是中国工人阶级的劳动与先进的苏联科学技术相结合的新的胜利。
    黄河铁桥兴建于一九○三年。根据资产阶级专家的设计，这座桥的保固期限为十五年，按照这种技术规定，黄河铁桥早就不能使用了。在中国人民掌握黄河铁桥以后，有苏联专家参加的铁道部桥梁视察团在一九四九年十一月到黄河铁桥实地调查，对黄河铁桥的重要部分进行了精密的研究和科学的试验，根据社会主义的科学理论，判定黄河铁桥可以继续使用，并且认为只要对黄河铁桥进行加固工程，和详加保养，还可以提高黄河铁桥的载重力和行车速度。
    苏联专家的意见，当时曾为一些工程技术人员所反对，他们根据资产阶级的落后的科学理论，认为
    “继续使用黄河铁桥，是极大的冒险行为”。一九五○年三月本报发表了黄河铁桥经过加固提高行车速度的通讯以后，有些工程技术人员还认为：“虽然加固了黄河铁桥，但无论如何不能改善黄河铁桥的根基。”“黄河铁桥好像蜈蚣浮在水面上，经不起黄河之水的冲击。”
    但是事实批驳了以上的各种说法，加固后的黄河铁桥，丝毫没有“经不起黄河之水的冲击”的迹象，今天的黄河铁桥的“根基”不仅改善了，而且在黄河铁桥上可以以每小时四十五公里的速度走行大型机车，可以一次牵引两千吨的货物。
    这事实，说明了苏联社会主义的科学技术远远地优越于资本主义的科学技术，说明了中国工人阶级的劳动和苏联的先进经验相结合以后，必然产生巨大的成就，也说明了工程技术人员必须认真地进行思想改造，虚心地向苏联学习；应该从黄河铁桥加固工程的成功的事实中，再一次认识苏联科学技术的优越性，从而树立起在科学技术上“一边倒”的思想，以迎接祖国大规模的经济建设。
