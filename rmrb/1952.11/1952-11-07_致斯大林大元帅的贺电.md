To our most beloved Comrade Stalin:
	On the occasion of the 35th anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution, we extend our warmest congratulations and highest respect to you and the entire Soviet people with unparalleled enthusiasm.

	For thirty-five years, the great Soviet people, under the banner of Lenin and under your leadership, have victoriously defeated enemies at home and abroad, brilliantly built a socialist society, and are now advancing towards the most sublime ideal of mankind—a communist society. The Soviet people have set the best example for the struggle of working people all over the world to win freedom and liberation and establish a happy life.

	The recently held 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union marked a new stage in the development of the Soviet Union. Your speech at this Congress and all the important documents of this Congress have infinitely encouraged the struggle of all mankind for lasting peace, for people's democracy, and for socialism.

	The revolutionary theories of Lenin and Stalin have pointed out the path to victory for the Chinese people's revolution; and the victory of the great October Socialist Revolution, the existence and continuous strengthening of the Soviet Union, and the sympathy and support of the Soviet people for the Chinese people's revolutionary struggle, are necessary conditions for the victory of the Chinese people's revolution. Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, under your kind attention, the Soviet government and the Soviet people have given the Chinese people tremendous assistance in all aspects, enabling our economic recovery and reconstruction to achieve such great achievements in just three years. We sincerely thank you and the Soviet people for this brotherly help to the Chinese people.

	The Chinese people deeply understand that the strong Sino-Soviet friendship alliance is a powerful guarantee against new war provocations and for safeguarding peace in Asia and the world. Based on three years of personal experience, the Chinese people deeply know that learning from the Soviet Union's experience in building socialist economy and national defense is of immeasurable importance to the future of our country. In order to further strengthen the close friendship between China and the Soviet Union, the Chinese people have decided to hold a large-scale "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month" nationwide from the 35th anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution to December 6th.

	Long live the great Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, the bastion of world peace, democracy, and socialism!

	Long live the permanent and strong friendship alliance between China and the Soviet Union!

	Long live Stalin, the best friend of the Chinese people, the great leader and teacher of the working people of the world!

	Celebration Assembly of All Circles in the Capital for the 35th Anniversary of the October Socialist Revolution
	November 6, 1952, in Beijing

    致斯大林大元帅的贺电最敬爱的斯大林同志：
    值此伟大的十月社会主义革命三十五周年之际，我们谨以无比的热情向您和全苏联人民致热烈的祝贺和崇高的敬意。
    三十五年来，伟大的苏联人民在列宁的旗帜下，在您的领导下，胜利地击败了国内外的敌人，光辉地建成了社会主义社会，现在正向着人类最崇高的理想——共产主义社会前进。苏联人民为全世界劳动人民争取自由解放和建立幸福生活的斗争树立了最好的榜样。
    最近召开的苏联共产党第十九次代表大会标志了苏联发展的新阶段。您在这个大会上的演说和这个大会的一切重要文献，对全世界人类争取持久和平、争取人民民主和争取社会主义的斗争作了无限的鼓励。
    列宁、斯大林的革命理论给中国人民指出了革命的胜利道路；而伟大的十月社会主义革命的胜利，苏联的存在和不断强大，苏联人民对于中国人民的革命斗争的同情和支持，是中国人民革命获得胜利的必要条件。中华人民共和国成立以后，在您的亲切关怀下，苏联政府和苏联人民给予中国人民以各方面的巨大的援助，使得我们的经济恢复和重建工作得以在短短的三年内获得了如此巨大的成就。我们衷心地感谢您和苏联人民对中国人民的这种兄弟般的帮助。
    中国人民深深了解强大的中苏友好同盟是反对新的战争挑拨、保卫亚洲和世界和平的有力保证。中国人民根据三年来的亲身体验，深深知道学习苏联建设社会主义经济和建设国防的经验对于我们国家的前途有不可估量的重要意义。为了进一步加强中苏两大国的亲密友谊，中国人民决定从伟大的十月社会主义革命三十五周年这个节日起至十二月六日止，在全国范围内大规模地举行“中苏友好月”。
    世界和平、民主、社会主义的堡垒——伟大的苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟万岁！
    中苏两国永久的强大的友好同盟万岁！
    中国人民的最好的朋友、全世界劳动人民的伟大领袖和导师斯大林万岁！
