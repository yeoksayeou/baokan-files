    Learning While Building
    ——The Formation of Anshan's Basic Construction Engineering Technical Force
    Chang Gong, Ai Zhi
    Every time we step into the steel capital of Anshan, which is undergoing large-scale construction, we cannot help but feel excited, because here we see the glorious future of our great motherland. Before April this year, the various basic construction sites in Anshan were still empty, but after April, a large-scale and moving scene of labor appeared. Thousands upon thousands of workers worked day and night, using their wisdom and hands to change the face of Anshan. Now, there are towering steel frames and rows of telephone poles everywhere, small mountains of sand, gravel, steel bars, templates, and pipes everywhere, speeding trains and cars everywhere, and roaring giant cranes, excavators, graders, and lightweight universal loaders everywhere; there are water pumps, welding boxes, air compressors, concrete vibrators, and various metal impact sounds everywhere. At the most intense times of work, it was extremely difficult to even pass through the crowds on each major construction site, because on one construction site, there were often six different professional companies and dozens of different types of engineering teams occupying every corner of the site at the same time—from high in the sky, to the ground, to more than ten meters underground.
    According to the state's planned plan, starting this year, Anshan will successively build many of the newest factories and mines—mechanized and automated factories and mines. Once these factories and mines start production, they will not require the heavy labor of thousands upon thousands of people, but only a few people who, by pressing countless buttons and operating various meters and machines, will produce various types of steel at an astonishing speed, steel that has never been produced in our country's history but is now most urgently needed for large-scale economic construction. The three major projects that started construction this year are the beginning of this great plan.
    Everyone knows that building such large-scale heavy industry factories is a first for our country. Not only do we lack experience, but some people have never even seen them. However, thanks to the enthusiastic labor of the workers of Anshan, the guidance of Soviet experts, and the support of the whole country, the progress of various projects is quite astonishing. Taking the three major projects that started this year as an example, one of them has already completed more than 50% of the total project volume; the foundation engineering of another project has been completed, and the installation of mechanical equipment is now underway; the refractory bricks of No. 8 blast furnace have been laid, and only a few pieces of equipment need to be installed. Coke ovens, recovery plants, blowers, and boilers in this project system will be completed according to schedule or ahead of schedule.
    This astonishing speed does not mean that we have not encountered difficulties, but rather that it demonstrates the high effectiveness of our overcoming difficulties. In the construction of these projects, the biggest difficulties we encountered were the large scale, complexity, and extremely precise technical requirements of the projects. Taking just the hundred or so various foundation projects of two of the projects as an example, the deepest excavation was 18 meters, and the largest was more than 3,000 cubic meters. There were more than a thousand types of steel bars required for these foundation projects, and the tolerance of the tens of thousands of anchor bolts installed on the foundation projects could not exceed three to five millimeters at most. But these projects are insignificant compared to the vast and complex geological survey, engineering design, and other projects. Taking geological survey as an example, determining the factory base requires testing more than 700 types of soil samples, and this one type of work alone takes more than a year. As for engineering design, it is even more complicated. This year alone, more than 1.3 million blueprints were printed, weighing a total of 12.8 tons, and if they were connected together, they would be 20 kilometers long.
    Faced with such huge and complex projects, our technical strength is very weak. Taking the Civil Construction Engineering Company as an example, technical personnel account for only 1.27% of the company's tens of thousands of employees, and apprentice technicians and students who have just graduated from universities and vocational schools, who lack practical work experience, account for about 77% of the technical personnel. Among the workers, four-fifths are farmers from the countryside, who not only lack operating experience but are also not accustomed to construction site life. However, this situation did not make people shrink back. From April this year to now, the engineering company has completed 103 unit projects, including excavating 150,000 cubic meters of earth, pouring 63,000 cubic meters of concrete for foundation engineering, laying 31,000 meters of sanitary pipes, painting 500,000 square meters, and building more than 200,000 square meters of worker housing, schools, etc. Other companies, such as the Mechanical Installation Engineering Company, the Metal Structure Engineering Company, and the Electrical Installation Engineering Company, have also completed their tasks under the same difficult circumstances as the Civil Construction Engineering Company.
    These achievements are not incomprehensible miracles. They are the result of the hard study and selfless labor of all basic construction workers and cadres in Anshan, under the guidance of Soviet advanced experience and Soviet experts, to strive for the early industrialization of the motherland. Taking the Civil Construction Engineering Company as an example, before the large-scale basic construction began, under the guidance of Soviet experts, it successively established seven affiliated processing plants for sand mining, stone quarrying, steel bars, formwork, carpentry, concrete, and slag bricks, a mechanized station, and a workers' corps. The establishment of these affiliated units not only quickly organized the large number of employees who poured in from all over the country, but also turned each affiliated unit into a school, enabling employees to quickly learn technology and master technology. This played a decisive role in accelerating project progress and ensuring project quality. Taking the mechanized station as an example, when many mechanized tools ordered from the Soviet Union were first delivered, few people knew how to use them, and they were anxiously staring blankly. But after half a year of study, not only have all the mechanized tools been started, but also many excellent crane, excavator, and universal loader drivers have emerged, who have exerted high work efficiency and completed huge amounts of engineering tasks. The mechanized excavator alone has completed 80,000 cubic meters of earthwork, and the crane has also completed 50,000 tons of lifting tasks.
    Taking the Mechanical Installation Engineering Company as another example, among the company's thousands of workers and technicians, no one had ever installed such complex mechanical equipment as it is now, but under the guidance of Soviet experts, the company successively held six training classes for cadres above the factory and team leader level, and for team leaders, skilled workers, and apprentices, which not only improved the technology of all employees, but also solved the difficulty of insufficient technical strength. They originally planned to complete 56% of the annual plan by the end of October, but they completed 58%. Taking the 16th roller conveyor of Project 0230 as an example, it was originally planned to be installed in 13 days, but because many workers had already learned installation technology in training, it only took six days to complete the task. There are also similar examples in Project 0190. In September, it was planned to install equipment weighing a total of 625 tons, but 810 tons were installed.
    The situation of the Metal Structure Engineering Company is also moving. This year, the company's tasks have increased fivefold compared to the past, and the time is very tight, but in addition to adding 1,700 new apprentices, the company has not increased its tools, equipment, and skilled workers. In order to solve this difficulty, the leadership once proposed to the workers the method of "teachers teaching apprentices, learning while doing, and practicing while doing." However, the result of doing so was that it occupied too many tools and affected work efficiency. So the workers proposed the method of "teachers lecturing at night, apprentices listening; teachers working during the day, apprentices watching; and practicing whenever there is free time." Using this method, they cultivated a large number of skilled workers and solved many difficulties. Taking welders as an example, there were originally only 63 in the company, and 9 had to be borrowed out frequently, but after such training, there are now hundreds of welders in the company, which has increased the capacity of the metal structure company fourfold.
    Anshan's large-scale basic construction is advancing so rapidly. Although there are still many difficulties ahead, the facts have already drawn a conclusion for us: We can build heavy industry, and we can build our motherland stronger and better!

    一面学习，一面建设
    ——鞍山基本建设工程技术力量的形成
    常工  爱芝
    当我们每次走进正在进行大规模建设的钢都鞍山的时候，总是抑制不住自己内心的激动，因为在这里看到了伟大祖国光辉的未来。今年四月以前，鞍山各个基本建设的工地，还是一片空旷，但在四月以后，出现了规模巨大的动人的劳动场面。成千成万的工人日夜紧张地在工地上，用智慧和双手改变着鞍山的面貌，如今到处是高耸的钢架和一排排的电线杆，到处是沙堆、碎石、钢筋、模板和管道堆成的小山，到处是奔驰着的火车、汽车，到处是吼叫着的巨大的起重机、挖土机、铲平机与轻便的万能装卸机；到处是抽水机、电焊箱、空气压缩机、混凝土震动器及各种金属冲击的声音。各主要工地，在工作最紧张的时候，甚至想从人群中间穿过去都是极为困难的，因为在一个工地上，往往有六个不同的专业公司和几十个不同工种的工程队，同时占据了工地的每个角落——从高空、地面直到深达十余公尺的地下。
    按照国家预定的计划，鞍山从今年开始，将要相继建设起许多个最新式的工厂和矿山——机械化与自动化的工厂和矿山。这些工厂和矿山一旦开始生产，用不着成千上万人的繁重劳动，而只要少数的人，按着无数的电纽，操纵着各种计器和机械，就会以惊人的速度来生产我国历史上从来没有生产过的、而今后大规模经济建设中最急需的各种钢材。今年开始建设的三项大工程，就是这一伟大计划的开端。
    谁都知道建设这样浩大规模的重工业工厂，在我国还是第一次。我们不但没有经验，甚至有些人从来也没有见过。但是，由于鞍山工人的热情劳动，苏联专家的指导和全国的支援，各项工程的进展速度，是十分惊人的。就以今年开始的三大工程来说，其中的一个工程到现在为止，已经完成总工程量的百分之五十以上；另一个工程的基础工程已经完成，现正紧张地安装机械设备；八号高炉的耐火砖已砌好，只等几件设备的安装，在这一工程系统中的炼焦炉、回收厂、鼓风机和锅炉等，都将按照预定计划或提前完工。
    这种惊人的速度，并不是说明我们没有遇到困难，恰好说明了我们克服困难的高度成效。在这些工程的建设中，我们碰到的最大的困难就是工程规模浩大、复杂，技术上的要求极为精密。单拿其中两项工程的百余个各式各样的基础工程来说，最深的掘土达十八公尺，最大的达三千多立方公尺。这些基础工程所需的钢筋有一千多种样式，而安装在基础工程上数以万计的地脚螺丝，其公差最多则不能超过三公厘到五公厘。但这些工程比起技术浩繁的地质勘察、工程设计等工程来，还是微不足道的。以地质勘察为例，确定厂基即需化验土样七百多种，仅这一工种，就要一年多的时间。至于说到工程设计，那就更为繁杂，仅今年翻印的图纸就达一百三十余万张，共重十二点八吨，如将其连在一起，长达二十公里。
    面对着这样巨大和复杂的工程，我们的技术力量却十分薄弱。以土木建筑工程公司为例，在该公司上万的职工中，技术人员只有百分之一点二七，缺乏实际工作经验的见习技术员与刚从大学、专科学校毕业的学生，又约占技术人员中的百分之七十七。在工人中，五分之四是来自乡间的农民，他们不仅缺乏操作经验，甚至也不习惯于工地生活。然而，这种情况并没有使人退缩，从今年四月到现在，该工程公司已完成了一百零三件单位工程，包括挖掘土方十五万立方公尺，基础工程浇灌混凝土六万三千立方公尺，铺设卫生管道三万一千公尺，刷油五十万平方公尺，建筑工人住宅、学校等二十多万平方公尺。其它如机械安装工程公司、金属结构工程公司与电气安装工程公司，也都和土木建筑工程公司一样，在同样困难的情形下，完成了自己的任务。
    这些成就并不是不可理解的奇迹。这是鞍山全部基本建设职工、干部，为争取祖国早日工业化，在苏联先进经验与苏联专家指导下，艰苦学习和忘我劳动的结果。就拿土木建筑工程公司来说，在大规模的基本建设未开始以前，就在苏联专家的指导下，先后建立了采沙、采石、钢筋、模板、木工、混凝土、矿渣砖等七个附属加工厂、一个机械化站和一个工人总队。这些附属单位的建立，不仅把从全国各地涌来的大批职工很快地组织起来了，而且每一个附属单位都变成了一座学校，使得职工们能够很快地学习技术、掌握技术。这对于加速工程进度和保证工程质量起了决定性的作用。以机械化站为例，当从苏联订购的许多机械化的工具运到之初，很少人会用，干瞪着眼睛着急。但经过半年来的学习，不但所有的机械化的工具都已开动了，还出现了许多优秀的起重机、挖土机与万能装卸机的驾驶员，他们发挥了高度的工作效率，完成了巨量的工程任务。仅机械化挖土机完成的土方就达八万立方公尺，起重机也完成了五万吨的起重任务。
    再拿机械安装工程公司来说，全公司数千工人和技术人员中，过去没有一个人安装过像目前这样复杂的机械设备，但是在苏联专家的指导下，全公司先后举办了厂、队长以上干部和班组长、技术工人、学徒等的六次训练班，不仅提高了全体职工的技术，而且解决了技术力量不足的困难。他们原计划到十月底完成全年计划的百分之五十六，结果却完成了百分之五十八。以○二三○工程的第十六号辊道为例，原计划为十三天安好，因为许多工人在训练中，已经学习了安装技术，结果只用了六天的时间，就完成任务。在○一九○工程中也有同样的例子，九月份计划安装共重六百二十五吨的设备，结果却安装了八百一十吨。
    金属结构工程公司的情形也是动人的。今年该公司的任务比过去增加五倍，而且时间很紧急，但全公司除了新添一千七百名徒工外，工具设备与技术工人均未增加。为了解决这一困难，领导上曾向工人提出“老师带徒弟，边学边干，边干边练”的办法。可是这样干的结果，占用工具太多，影响工作效率。于是工人们就又提出“晚上老师讲，学徒听；白天老师干，学徒看；一有空儿就去练”的办法。用这个办法，他们培养了大批的技术工人，解决了许多的困难。以电焊工为例，原来全公司只有六十三个，还要经常借出去九个，但经过这样培养后，现在全公司电焊工已有数百个了，使金属结构公司的能力提高了四倍。
    鞍山大规模的基本建设，就是这样迅速地前进着。尽管前面还有许多的困难，但事实已经向我们作了结论：我们能够建设重工业，能够把我们祖国建设得更强盛、更美好！
