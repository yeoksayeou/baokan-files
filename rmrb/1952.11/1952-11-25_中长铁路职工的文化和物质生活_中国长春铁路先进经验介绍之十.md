    Over the past two years, the China Changchun Railway, due to systematically learning and promoting the advanced experiences of the Soviet Union, has achieved "high efficiency, low cost, and high profits," and thus, the cultural and material life of its employees has also been significantly improved. Soviet experts attached great importance to cultural activities. During this period, the China Changchun Railway trained more than 35,000 cadres. On average, more than 35,000 cadres studied technology and culture in their spare time each month. The entire railway printed more than 150,000 copies of books and held more than 40,000 technical seminars. Each branch bureau established middle and primary schools. There are now 76 middle and primary schools, solving the enrollment problems for employees' children. More than 34,000 children of employees are studying in primary schools. In addition, there are seven kindergartens. Great achievements have also been made in eliminating illiteracy.
    In order to carry out the cultural and recreational activities of the China Changchun Railway, more than 20 Soviet literary and art experts worked in the ten large cultural centers and clubs of the China Changchun Railway. In the Chinese employee art troupes, Soviet experts introduced Soviet theories of drama, dance, and music, which greatly helped to improve the artistic level of the troupe members.
    Soviet experts are very concerned about amateur cultural activities. In order to popularize cultural activities, not only is this work carried out among employees' families and children, but also cultural trains are sent to perform along the railway lines. The China Changchun Railway holds an annual literary and artistic review, with 3,428 amateur literary and artistic workers participating. The entire railway has held 21 literary and artistic training classes, with 964 people trained. After returning to their workplaces, the trained students helped the on-site workers create scripts, enlivening the on-site cultural life. At the 1952 literary and artistic review, the performed scripts "Looking into the Distance," "Overshooting the Axis," and "Loading and Unloading Dance" were all written by the on-site workers themselves. The forms of cultural activities are very diverse, including opera, drama, dance, chorus, solo, orchestral ensemble, musical solo, living newspaper, song and dance drama, comic dialogue drama, cross-talk, and two-person comic show.
    In addition to the two larger libraries on the entire railway, each cultural center and club also has a library. In addition, 105 mobile book boxes are organized to circulate along the railway lines.
    Soviet experts also provided great help in sports activities. Eight Soviet sports experts specialize in sports work, helping us to hold 22 sports training classes, training 1,521 sports cadres. In addition, they also held a sports training class for the national railway system with more than 300 participants. In addition to organizing 508 basketball teams, 372 volleyball teams, and 38 football teams on the entire railway; 463 sports activity groups were also organized in grassroots units. The entire railway held three large-scale sports meets and 179 smaller sports meets. 40,973 people participated in sports activities. The entire railway also carried out mass calisthenics, and there was also ice skating in winter. The widespread development of sports activities has greatly improved the health of employees.
    Comrade Grunichyov, Director of the Administration, issued instructions on October 18, 1950, requiring the railway health and medical organizations to establish a business philosophy with prevention as the main focus. According to this instruction, dozens of Soviet experts helped Chinese cadres quickly establish health and epidemic prevention institutions, prevention and treatment institutions, and establish advanced health supervision systems and medical and nursing systems, organize health inspections and physical examinations, and propose many suggestions to enhance the health of employees, increase and improve safety equipment, and improve the working environment, most of which have been adopted and implemented. All food units on the entire railway are subject to health supervision.
    In order to mobilize the masses to pay attention to health work, more than 10,000 health propaganda activities have been carried out in the past two years, and 44,311 employees and their families have received short-term health education.
    Due to the above series of preventive work, the diseases of employees and their families have gradually decreased since the establishment of the China Changchun Railway. In the first half of 1952, the incidence of statutory infectious diseases (such as typhoid fever, cholera, etc.) decreased by 60% compared with the first half of 1951. In medical work, the level of medical work has been improved due to the study of Pavlov's advanced medical thought and the adoption of 21 advanced medical technologies. The bed turnover rate in 1950 was 17.4 times, and in 1951 it was actually 20.2 times, so 4,373 more patients were accommodated throughout the year.
    Soviet experts are particularly concerned about the lives and welfare of employees. In the past two years, with the development of transportation, the welfare of employees has also been improved. The China Changchun Railway originally had 53 stores, which have now increased to 93. In addition to stores, there are also kiosks. In order to supply the daily necessities of railway employees at small stations along the line, livelihood trains are sent to the line twice a month. With the development of production, the purchasing power of employees continues to increase. In 1950, the sales of refined grains accounted for 52% of the total grain sales, which increased to 58% in 1951, and 62% in 1952. Employees are also purchasing more nutritious foods. Taking pork sales as an example, it increased by 217% in 1951 compared to 1950, and by 364% in 1952 compared to 1951.
    The China Changchun Railway has farms, which also play a significant role in improving the lives of employees. From May 1950 to August 1952, the output of milk alone reached 1,417,570 kilograms. Most of this milk was sent to employees' homes and canteens for consumption.
    In the past two years, the China Changchun Railway has done a lot of work in terms of employee welfare and living, ensuring the needs of employees' lives, and thus also powerfully ensuring the completion of transportation tasks.

    两年多来，中长铁路由于系统地学习与推广了苏联先进经验，做到了“效率高、成本低、利润多”，因而员工的文化生活和物质生活也获得显著改善。苏联专家非常重视文化活动。在这期间，中长铁路一共培养和训练了三万五千多名干部。每月平均有三万五千多名干部，在业余时间学习技术和文化。全路刊印了十五万多册书籍，举办了四万多次技术座谈会。每个分局都成立了中学和小学。现有中、小学校七十六所，解决了员工子弟的入学问题。小学读书的员工的子弟已达三万四千多名。此外还有七个幼儿园。在扫除文盲工作中，也获得了很大的成就。
    为着开展中长铁路的文娱活动，二十多位苏联文艺专家在中长铁路十个大型的文化馆、俱乐部里工作。在中国员工文工团里，苏联专家介绍了苏联的戏剧、舞蹈和音乐方面的理论，对于提高团员的艺术水平有很大作用。
    苏联专家对于业余文化活动，非常关心。为了文化活动的普及，不但在职工家属、儿童中开展这一工作，而且还派出文化列车到沿线出演。中长铁路每年都举行文艺检阅大会，参加检阅的业余文艺工作者有三千四百二十八名。全路一共举办了文艺训练班二十一次，受训练的有九百六十四人。训练出来的学员回到现场以后，帮助现场工人创作剧本，活跃了现场的文化生活。在一九五二年的文艺检阅大会上，演出的剧本“往远看”、“超轴”、“装卸舞”等都是现场工人自己写的。文化活动的形式很广泛，有歌剧、话剧、舞蹈、合唱、独唱、管弦乐合奏、音乐独奏、活报剧、歌舞剧、快板剧、相声、双簧等。
    全路除两个较大的图书馆外，每个文化馆、俱乐部也都有图书馆。此外还组织一百零五个流动图书箱在沿线流动。
    苏联专家在体育活动中，也给我们很大的帮助。八位苏联体育专家，专门做体育工作，帮助我们举办了体育训练班二十二次，培养体育干部一千五百二十一人。另外，还给全国铁路举办了一次有三百余人参加的体育训练班。全路除了组织了篮球队五百零八队、排球队三百七十二队、足球队三十八队外；在基层单位还组织体育活动小组四百六十三组。全路举行了三次大规模的运动会和一百七十九次较小的运动会。参加体育活动的有四万零九百七十三人。全路还开展了群众性的广播体操，在冬季还有滑冰活动。体育活动的普遍开展，大大地增进了员工的健康。
    管理局长格鲁尼切夫同志曾在一九五零年十月十八日发出指示，要求铁路卫生医疗机关，树立以预防为主的业务思想。根据这一指示，数十位苏联专家，帮助中国干部迅速地成立了卫生防疫机构、防治机构，建立了先进的卫生监察制度和医疗、护理制度，组织了卫生检查和健康检查，提出很多增强职工健康、增设和改进安全设备、改善劳动环境的建议，其中大部分都采纳施行了。全路所有食品单位，均受到卫生监督。
    为了发动群众注意卫生工作，两年多来，进行了一万多次卫生宣传，并有四万四千三百一十一名员工和家属受到了短时间的卫生教育。
    由于进行了以上一系列的预防工作，在中长铁路成立以后，员工和家属的疾病逐渐减少了。一九五二年的上半年法定传染病（如伤寒、霍乱等），比
    一九五一年上半年降低了百分之六十。在医疗工作上，由于学习了巴甫洛夫先进的医学思想，采用了二十一项先进医疗技术，因而提高了医疗工作的水平。一九五○年病床周转率为一七点四次，一九五
    一年实际为二○点二次，因此全年多收容了四千三百七十三名病人。
    苏联专家是特别关心员工的生活和福利的。两年多来，随着运输事业的发展，员工的福利也得到了提高。中长铁路原有商店五十三处，现在增加为九十三处，除商店外，还有商亭。为了供应沿线小站铁路员工的生活必需物资，每月派生计列车到沿线去两次。随着生产的发展，员工购买力不断提高。一九五○年细粮的销售额占全部粮食的销售额百分之五十二，一九五一年增加到百分之五十八，一九五二年则为百分之六十二。员工购买富有营养的食品也在增加。以猪肉的销售量来说，一九五一年比一九五○年增加了百分之二百一十七，一九五二年比一九五一年增加了百分之三百六十四。
    中长铁路设有农场，对于改善员工生活，也起了很大的作用。从一九五○年五月到一九五二年八月，仅牛奶一项产量就达一百四十一万七千五百七十公斤。这些牛奶大部分送到员工家中和食堂中去食用。
    中长铁路两年多来，在员工的福利和生活方面，做了很多工作，保证了员工生活的需要，从而也有力地保证了运输任务的完成。
