Xinhua News Agency, New York, 2nd dispatch: The Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly continued its discussion of the "Report of the United Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea" on October 30th.

After the Colombian representative, Sourdís, slavishly repeated Acheson's remarks on the issue of repatriating Korean prisoners of war and made numerous slanderous attacks against the Soviet Union, the British representative, Lloyd, and the French representative, Hoppenot, then spoke.

The British and French representatives concentrated their attention on the issue of prisoner-of-war repatriation. They did not dare deny that the right of prisoners of war to be repatriated is a universally recognized rule in international relations. They played new tricks, attempting to find some reasons for "exceptions" to this rule, and distorting the original meaning of the rule by various sophistical means.

The British representative's speech exposed the panic of the British ruling clique because the British people were demanding an immediate end to the Korean War and a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. Lloyd's speech began with an appeal not to succumb to temptation, not to consult public opinion, but only to address the representatives. This was no accident. Like Acheson, this British representative hypocritically said that the Anglo-American bloc did not want to prolong the Korean War for a single unnecessary second.

In his speech, the British representative tried his best to defend the US refusal to repatriate prisoners of war and tried every means to conceal the crimes of the US military command in Korea in massacring prisoners of war.

Lloyd listed many issues on which agreement had been reached at the Panmunjom negotiations, and he expressed his belief that the issue of prisoner-of-war repatriation could be resolved. But at the same time, he said that as far as the basic principle of repatriation was concerned, there was no room for compromise, thus supporting the attitude of the US military command in Korea.

The British representative opposed the Soviet delegation's proposal to establish a committee to resolve the Korean issue, using the excuse that such a committee was unnecessary. Finally, Lloyd hypocritically said that he was not very clear about the Soviet Union's attitude towards the issue of prisoner-of-war repatriation and the proposal made by the command of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers on October 8th regarding this issue.

The French representative, Hoppenot, also said that he also agreed to end the Korean War as soon as possible based on conditions that were "honorable" for both sides. The French representative acknowledged that the clause in the Geneva Convention on Prisoners of War stipulating the repatriation of all prisoners of war after the end of hostilities was "reasonable" and "humane," because it was intended to prevent the other party from forcibly detaining prisoners of war. But on this point, the French representative put forward an opinion saying that in the "special" circumstances in Korea, "there is reason not to follow this regulation." He attempted to support the US military command's refusal to repatriate prisoners of war under such a statement. He made no mention of the Soviet delegation's proposal to establish a committee to resolve the Korean issue peacefully.

Although everyone knows that the head of the Soviet delegation, Vyshinsky, had already provided a clear and detailed answer to the issue of repatriating prisoners of war in Korea in his speech on October 29th, the British and French representatives still demanded that the Soviet delegation explain its attitude on this issue.

### 联大政委会继续讨论“联合国朝鲜统一复兴委员会的报告”  英法代表无耻为美国扣留战俘主张辩解

    联大政委会继续讨论“联合国朝鲜统一复兴委员会的报告”
    英法代表无耻为美国扣留战俘主张辩解
    【新华社二日讯】塔斯社纽约讯：十月三十日，联合国大会政治委员会继续讨论“联合国朝鲜统一复兴委员会的报告”。
    在哥伦比亚代表索尔迪斯奴才似地重复了艾奇逊关于遣返朝鲜战俘问题的说法并对苏联进行了许多诽谤攻击以后，英国代表劳埃德与法国代表奥培诺接着发言。
    英法两国代表集中注意力在遣返战俘问题上，他们不敢否认战俘有权被遣返是国际关系上举世公认的规则。他们玩弄新的花样，企图为这种规则的“例外情况”找寻一些理由，并用各种讼师手段来歪曲这个规则的原意。
    英国代表的发言，暴露了英国统治集团因为英国人民要求立刻停止朝鲜战争并和平解决朝鲜问题而感到惊惶失措的情绪。劳埃德的发言一开始就呼吁不要向诱惑屈服，不要请舆论公断，而只向代表们发表演说。这并不是偶然的。这位英国代表像艾奇逊一样假惺惺地说，英美集团并不想把朝鲜战争作一秒钟的不必要的延长。
    英国代表在他的发言中极力为美国拒绝遣返战俘辩解，并想尽一切方法来掩饰美军司令部在朝鲜屠杀战俘的罪行。
    劳埃德列举板门店谈判已获致协议的许多问题，他表示相信遣返战俘问题是可以得到解决的。但他同时又说：仅就遣返的基本原则而言，是谈不上妥协办法的，这样，他就支持了在朝鲜的美军司令部的态度。
    英国代表反对苏联代表团主张设立一个解决朝鲜问题的委员会的建议，他藉口说：这样的一个委员会是不必要的。最后劳埃德假惺惺地说：他不十分明了苏联对于遣返战俘问题以及朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军司令部十月八日提出的关于这个问题的建议所抱的态度。
    法国代表奥培诺也说：他也赞成根据对于双方都“光荣的条件”，尽速结束朝鲜战事。法国代表承认：日内瓦战俘公约中规定在战事结束后遣返所有战俘的条款是“合理的”，“合乎人情的”，因为这是为了防止对方强制扣留战俘。但在这点上，法国代表提出了一个意见说：在朝鲜“特殊”的情形下，“有理由可以不按照这个规定”。他企图在这样的说法下支持在朝鲜的美军司令部拒绝遣返战俘的主张。他绝口不谈苏联代表团所提出的关于设立一个以和平办法来解决朝鲜问题的委员会的提案。
    虽然，大家知道，苏联代表团团长维辛斯基在他十月二十九日的发言里已经对遣返在朝鲜的战俘问题提供了清楚而又详尽的答复，但是英国代表和法国代表仍旧要求苏联代表团说明它对这个问题的态度。
