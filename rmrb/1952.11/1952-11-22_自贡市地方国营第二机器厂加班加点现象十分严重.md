    The Zigong Municipal State-Owned Second Machinery Factory's Overtime Work Phenomenon is Extremely Serious
    Editor: The overtime work phenomenon at the Zigong Municipal State-Owned Second Machinery Factory in Sichuan is extremely serious.

    The main reason for the overtime work at this factory is that the leading cadres have a simplistic view of tasks and are not good at business management. Supply, sales, and production lack comprehensive planning, leading to a state of chaotic production. For example, when making the steam drum for the vacuum pot, the riveters worked overtime for several days and nights to complete a new task, totaling 173.5 hours, but then had to stop work due to lack of materials. Also, due to poor design, the rework and scrap rate is very high, and overtime is used to make up for the task. In August, 45 people in the factory worked overtime for 40 to 100 hours, with an average of over 80 hours of overtime per person for the whole month. Among them, caster Zhou Zaibang worked 153 hours of overtime. He worked overtime consecutively six times, with the highest single overtime period being 16 hours. The overtime situation in September was similar to that in August. The most serious case was riveter Lan Enchang, who worked from the 13th until 2:30 AM the next day, then worked overtime again until 5 PM on the 14th, then again until 4:30 PM on the 15th, and then again until 11 PM on the 16th. This situation seriously affected the workers' health. Caster Fan Dehua fainted due to excessive overtime, electrician Hu Yuanqing suffered nosebleeds due to working in high temperatures for a long time, and caster Yan Shuchen's eyes could not open due to excessive sleepless nights.

    I hope that the leading cadres of this factory will formulate a strict work plan and improve various work systems to quickly correct the overtime work phenomenon.    He Qing

### 自贡市地方国营第二机器厂加班加点现象十分严重

    自贡市地方国营第二机器厂加班加点现象十分严重
    编辑同志：四川自贡市地方国营第二机器厂，加班加点现象非常严重。
    该厂产生加班加点的主要原因，是领导干部有单纯任务观点，不善于经营管理，供销、生产都没有全盘计划，使生产陷于忙乱状态。如做真空锅的汽鼓，铆工间为完成某一新任务，一连几昼夜加班加点，共达一百七十三小时半，但最后又停工待料。还有因设计不周，返工报废率很大，最后以加班加点来补足任务的。八月份这个厂全厂加班加点在四十小时到一百小时的有四十五人，平均每人全月加班八十小时以上。其中铸工周在邦加班加点一百五十三小时，他连续加班六次，加班最高一次为十六小时。九月份加班加点情况和八月份相差无几。其中最严重的是铆工兰恩昌，他从十三日起工作到次日二时半，十四日又加点到晚五时，十五日又加点到晚四点半，十六日又加点到晚十一时。这种情况严重地影响了工人的健康，铸工范德华因加点过多而晕倒，电工胡元清因长时间在高温下工作而流鼻血，铸工颜树臣因熬夜过多眼睛都睁不开了。
    我希望这个厂的领导干部，制订出一套严密的工作计划，和健全各种工作制度，迅速纠正加班加点现象。    何青
