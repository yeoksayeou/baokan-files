    Workers with Sufficient Rest
    Have Ample Energy for Production
    Comrade Editor: I've been a turbine operator at the Shijingshan Power Plant for over thirty years, and I've never had such comfortable rest as I do now! From the bottom of my heart, I thank the higher authorities for the decision "Regarding Protecting Workers' Health and Rationally Allocating Spare Time."
    In the past, our turbine operators worked a three-shift system, day and night, with each shift being exactly eight hours. Each time we were assigned the late-night shift, it would last for a whole week. The situation was like this: According to regulations, we were supposed to start work at midnight and finish at eight o'clock the next morning. However, to implement the shift handover responsibility system, we had to be on-site by 11:45 pm to understand the operating conditions of the machines from the departing colleagues and check if there were any problems with the machinery. By the time we finished work at eight o'clock the next morning, we were covered in sweat and coal dust. A shower would take about thirty minutes, reading the newspaper another fifteen, and then there would be a meeting to review the day's production, which would take at least fifteen minutes. Immediately following that, either the administration would hold a meeting to discuss production plans, or the trade union would have activities, or there would be cultural classes at the evening school. Every day, it would be past 11:00 am before we could go home for a meal, and we wouldn't get to sleep until at least 1:00 pm in the afternoon.
    After a sleepless night, having to attend so many meetings during the day left us feeling really drained, and our minds were not sharp at all. Sitting there in the meetings, we would doze off, not because we deliberately wanted to sleep, but because we simply couldn't stay awake! There was also another drawback to the meetings back then. Every time, we would only get a message right before the meeting started. What was the meeting about? What issues would be addressed? We never knew in advance, so the attendees were always dragging their feet. During the meeting, no one knew what to say, so no one could speak up.
    In August of this year, Comrade Wang Zimian, the Party Branch Secretary of our factory, proposed at the general meeting of all employees to rationally allocate employees' spare time in order to reduce employee fatigue and protect their health. This decision is truly wonderful. Our shift (the late-night shift), which used to have newspaper reading and meetings in the morning, has now uniformly moved them to the evening. Only after everyone has had enough sleep, eaten well, and rested well, do we come to the meetings and study sessions. This has really relieved our fatigue, and our minds are much sharper. Some meetings have been streamlined, and we are encouraged to learn one thing at a time. I now only participate in the safety group's technical learning and attend Party classes. I don't have to participate in other activities if I don't need to. Recently, our factory, based on the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, changed the turbine operators' schedule from a three-shift system to a seven-small-shift system. This way, we rotate shifts every four days and have a major break every twelve days. How else could I say that I haven't had such comfortable rest in decades! The Communist Party is so thoughtful in considering the interests of the people in every way. If we don't improve our consciousness and actively produce, how can we possibly justify it!

### 职工有了足够的休息  就有了充分精力进行生产

    职工有了足够的休息
    就有了充分精力进行生产
    编辑同志：我在石景山发电厂汽机场当了三十几年的运转工人，从来就没有像今天这么舒坦地休息过呀！我从心眼里感谢上级“关于保护职工健康，合理支配业余活动时间”的决定。
    我们运转工人过去是昼夜三班制，每班恰好是八小时。每次轮值后半夜班时，一连就是一个星期。那时情形是这样：按规定是夜里十二点上班，明早八点钟下班。为了实行交接班负责制，十一时三刻便得到现场，向交班的伙伴了解机器运转的情况，检查机器有没有毛病。干到明早八点钟下班时，满身是臭汗和煤灰，洗个澡大约花三十分钟，再读十五分钟的报，往后就开碰头会，检查这一天的生产情况，至少也要十五分钟。紧跟着不是行政要开会讨论生产计划，就是工会有活动，再不就是上业余学校的文化课。哪一天都要到上午十一点多才能回家吃饭，睡觉总得在下午一点钟。
    夜里熬了一宵，白天还要开这么多的会，精神实在是差劲，脑筋也实在不灵活。坐在那里开会，听着听着就打起瞌睡来，可不是存心贪睡，实在是支持不住呀！那时候开会还有一个缺点，每次开会都是临开给你捎个信，开什么会？解决哪些问题？事先咱也闹不清，到会的人总是拖拖拉拉的；开会时大伙不知讲些什么好，也就都不能发言。
    今年八月间，我们厂的党总支书记王自勉同志在全体职工大会上提出要合理支配职工的业余活动时间，为的是减少职工的疲劳，保护职工健康。这个决定可真是好，我们这一班（后半夜班）原来是早上读报和开会的，现在已一律挪到晚上了，等到大伙睡足、吃饱，休息好了才来开会和学习。这一来可真歇过乏来啦，脑筋可也就得劲了。有些会议精简了，并且提倡学了一样再学一样，我现在就只参加安全组的技术学习和听党课，其他一些活动可以不参加的就不参加了。最近我们厂根据苏联的先进经验，把运转的职工由三班制改为七小班制，这样，四天一倒班，十二天一大歇班。要不，我怎么说几十年来都没有这么舒坦地休息过呀！共产党就是这样处处周到地为人民的利益打算，咱不提高觉悟，不积极生产，哪还行呀！    李宝镜
