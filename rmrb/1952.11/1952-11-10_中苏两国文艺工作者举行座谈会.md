Xinhua News Agency, November 8th: Sino-Soviet literary and art workers held a grand symposium at 2 p.m. on the 8th in an atmosphere of brotherly friendship. The participants included the head of the Soviet cultural workers delegation, Tikhonov, members Zakharov, the leader of the Soviet art troupe, Tsuraki, and members Mikhailov, Gaidai, Halima Naserova, Tamara Hanon, Nechayev, Peibutov, Sokolova, Pomazkov, Kogan, Yemelyanova, Obraztsov, Metnik, Maksimova, Obraztsova, and seventeen others; and more than two hundred people, including Mao Dun, Zhou Yang, Ouyang Yuqian, Sha Kefu, Tian Han, Lü Ji, Ai Qing, Zhao Di, Cao Yu, A Ying, Cao Jinghua, Dai Ailian, Zhou Xinfang, Lao She, Zhang Geng, Gao Yu Bao, Ma Ke, Li Huanzhi, Sheng Jialun, Shu Mo, Yuan Xuefen, Chang Xiangyu, Guo Lanying, Qu Xixian, Zhang Yunxi, Wang Kun, Lan Ma, and others.

Mao Dun, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, extended a warm welcome to the Soviet literary and art workers on behalf of the national literary and art workers. In his speech, he said: The path of socialist realism taken by Soviet literature and art is the path that our literature and art must take. Today, we are able to have the old大哥 (big brother) who has walked this road to discuss literary and art issues with us, which will be of great help to our literary and art work.

The leader of the Soviet art troupe, Tsuraki, Vice Chairman of the Arts Committee of the Soviet Council of Ministers, delivered an enthusiastic speech at the meeting. He said: We Soviets love our Chinese brothers. Today, we are able to come to China, which has a long cultural history, to learn from you and tell you all about our experience in building socialist literature and art. If this can make any contribution to you, that would be our greatest happiness.

Subsequently, Chinese and Soviet literary and art workers were divided into three groups: music, dance, and drama, for discussions.

The music group was hosted by Lü Ji, Vice President and Composer of the Central Conservatory of Music. The symposium was conducted in a very lively and vivid manner. Musicians from China and the Soviet Union exchanged views on how to solve the problem of national forms in vocal performance. First, famous opera workers from all over China performed some operas. The programs performed included Chang Xiangyu's Henan Opera "Broken Bridge," Li Zongyi and Lou Zhenkui's Peking Opera "Second Entry to the Palace," Chen Bohua's Han Opera "Cosmic Front," Wu Xiaolou's Yue Opera "Dragon and Phoenix Lock," Xia Qing's Ping Opera "Persuading the Husband," Chen Shufang's Sichuan Opera "Carved Window," and Guo Lanying's Shanxi Clapper Opera "Qin Xianglian." Soviet musicians raised many enthusiastic questions and valuable opinions on the performances of these Chinese national operas. They were all very excited about the gathering of Chinese and Soviet literary and art workers. Soviet musicians who spoke at the meeting included Tsuraki, Zakharov, Mikhailov, Nechayev, Gaidai, Halima Naserova, and others. Tsuraki believed that operas that preserve the forms of folk songs are more meaningful for the development of Chinese music because they describe characters more realistically. He also pointed out that the experience of reforming folk music in various Soviet ethnic groups can be used as a reference for Chinese comrades in order to better express modern life. Soviet People's Artist, Azerbaijani singer Halima Naserova, introduced Azerbaijan's experience in reforming and developing national music after the establishment of Soviet power. She believes that the Chinese opera music performed today is a valuable national cultural heritage, which should be respected and will surely be developed and improved in the future. She also sang a revised "Azerbaijani Classical Folk Song" on the spot.

The dance group was hosted by Dai Ailian, Chairman of the All-China Dance Workers Association and dancer. After introducing the situation of Chinese dance art, she raised the question of how to use national forms in dance to express modern life and asked Soviet dancers for advice.

Tamara Hanon, People's Artist of the Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic, explained that the art of the people must come from the people, using her experience in creating the "Silk Reeling Dance" and "Cotton Picking Dance," which are very popular in Uzbekistan, based on the production movements of the working people and drawing on the traditions of folk dance. She said: New dances must not be separated from the tradition of national classical art. Pomazkov, a ballet dancer from the Moscow Opera and Ballet Theatre, said: Soviet dances are all taken from folk tales, many of which depict the labor life of the working people, and are therefore loved by the people. During the discussion, Tamara Hanon often performed dance movements to explain her speech.

The drama group was hosted by Tian Han, Director of the Arts Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government and dramatist. Obraztsov, artistic director of the Soviet Puppet Theater, gave a brief overview of the history of Soviet drama development in his speech. He said: Before the October Revolution, Russian drama belonged entirely to the aristocratic landlords, and puppet drama was almost lost among the people. After the October Revolution, drama belonged to the people and has been greatly developed. Now every factory in the Soviet Union has its own theater and cultural palace, and many famous dramatists often go to factories to perform for workers. Obraztsov also gave a vivid explanation of the educational significance of puppet drama for children, as well as stage installations and performance techniques. Then Obraztsov performed puppet drama programs "Monkey," "Cat," "Singer Without a Voice," "Come Back! I Forgive You," "Tiger Taming," and "Drunkard." The unique satirical techniques he used in these performances aroused great interest among Chinese literary and art workers and brought sustained applause.

After the group discussions, more than two hundred literary and art workers from China and the Soviet Union gathered together again. At this time, at the invitation of Chinese literary and art workers, Peibutov, People's Artist of the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic, sang Azerbaijani folk songs - an interlude from the film "The Peddler and the Lady" and "My Tender One"; and sang the Chinese folk song "In That Distant Place" that he had recently learned. His rich emotion and superb technique fully expressed the national color of the song. Then Obraztsov performed puppet drama programs for all the literary and art workers present. Their performances were greatly welcomed by Chinese literary and art workers.

The symposium lasted for four hours. The warm and joyful atmosphere at the meeting concretely demonstrated the great friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people.

    中苏两国文艺工作者举行座谈会
    【新华社八日讯】中苏两国的文学艺术工作者八日下午二时在充满着兄弟般的友好的空气中，举行了一个盛大的文艺座谈会。参加座谈会的有苏联文化工作者代表团团长吉洪诺夫，团员查哈罗夫，苏联艺术工作团领导人楚拉基和团员米哈伊洛夫、盖达伊、哈利马·纳赛罗娃、塔马拉·哈侬、聂恰耶夫、裴布托夫、索科洛娃、波马兹科夫、柯岗、叶美里扬诺娃、奥布拉兹卓夫、梅特尼克、马克西莫娃、奥布拉兹卓娃等十七人；有茅盾、周扬、欧阳予倩、沙可夫、田汉、吕骥、艾青、赵渢、曹禺、阿英、曹靖华、戴爱莲、周信芳、老舍、张庚、高玉宝、马可、李焕之、盛家伦、舒模、袁雪芬、常香玉、郭兰英、瞿希贤、张云溪、王昆、蓝马等二百多人。
    中华全国文学艺术界联合会副主席茅盾代表全国文艺工作者对苏联文艺工作者表示热烈的欢迎。他致词说：苏联文艺工作所走过的社会主义现实主义的道路，就是我国文艺工作要走的道路。今天我们能够得到走过这道路的老大哥和我们在一起座谈文艺问题，将对我们的文艺工作有着极大的帮助作用。
    苏联艺术工作团领导人、苏联部长会议艺术委员会副主席楚拉基在会上发表热情洋溢的讲话。他说：我们苏维埃人是热爱自己的中国兄弟的。今天我们能到具有悠久文化历史的中国来，要向你们学习，并把我们建设社会主义文艺的经验全部地告诉你们。如果这对你们有任何贡献，那就是我们莫大的幸福。
    接着，中苏两国的文艺工作者分为音乐、舞蹈、戏剧三个小组进行座谈。
    音乐组由中央音乐学院副院长、作曲家吕骥主持。座谈会以极为活泼生动的方式进行。中苏两国音乐家交换了如何解决声乐演唱上民族形式问题的意见。首先由我国各地著名的戏曲工作者演唱了一些戏曲。演唱的节目，有常香玉的豫剧“断桥”，李宗义、娄振奎的京剧“二进宫”，陈伯华的汉剧“宇宙锋”，吴小楼的越剧“龙凤锁”，夏青的评剧“劝夫”，陈书舫的川剧“雕窗”，郭兰英的山西梆子“秦香莲”。苏联音乐家就我国这些民族戏曲的演唱提出了很多热情的询问和宝贵的意见。他们都对中苏两国文艺工作者的欢聚一堂感到非常兴奋。在会上发言的苏联音乐家，有楚拉基、查哈罗夫、米哈伊洛夫、聂恰耶夫、盖达伊、哈利马·纳赛罗娃等。楚拉基认为保存着民歌形式的戏曲，因为它们描写人物性格更真实，对中国音乐的发展更具有重要的意义。他也指出：为了更适宜于表现现代生活，苏联各民族民间音乐的改革经验，可供中国同志们参考。苏联人民演员、阿塞拜疆女歌唱家哈利马·纳赛罗娃介绍了阿塞拜疆在建立苏维埃政权后改革和发展民族音乐的经验。她认为今天演唱的中国人民的戏曲音乐，都是宝贵的民族文化遗产，应该尊重，将来也一定会得到发展和提高。她并当场演唱了一首经过改编的“阿塞拜疆古典民歌”。
    舞蹈组由中华全国舞蹈工作者协会主席、舞蹈家戴爱莲主持。她在介绍了中国舞蹈艺术的情况后，提出了在舞蹈中如何运用民族形式表现现代生活的问题，向苏联舞蹈家请教。
    乌兹别克加盟共和国人民演员塔马拉·哈侬以她根据劳动人民的生产动作，和吸取民间舞蹈的传统，创作了在乌兹别克非常流行的“缫丝舞”和“采棉舞”的经验，说明了人民的艺术一定要从人民中来。她说：新舞蹈绝不能脱离民族古典艺术传统。莫斯科歌舞剧院巴蕾舞演员波马兹科夫发言说：苏联舞蹈都是取材民间，很多是表现劳动人民的劳动生活的，因而它很为人民所喜爱。在座谈时，塔马拉·哈侬曾不时表演舞蹈动作来解释她的发言。
    戏剧组由中央人民政府文化部艺术事业管理局局长、戏剧家田汉主持。苏联木偶戏剧院艺术指导奥布拉兹卓夫在发言中概括地叙述苏联戏剧发展的历史。他说：十月革命前俄国的戏剧完全属于贵族地主，木偶戏剧在民间几乎失传了。十月革命后，戏剧才归人民所有，并得到了巨大的发展。现在苏联的每一个工厂都有自己的剧场和文化宫，许多著名的戏剧家也经常到工厂去为工人表演。奥布拉兹卓夫又对木偶戏剧对儿童的教育意义和剧台装置、表演技术等作了很生动的说明。接着奥布拉兹卓夫表演了木偶戏剧的节目“猴”、“猫”、“没有嗓子的歌唱家”、“回来吧！我饶恕你”、“驯虎”、“醉鬼”等。他在这些表演中所运用的独特的讽刺手法，引起中国文艺工作者极大的兴趣和经久不息的鼓掌。
    分组座谈结束后，中苏两国的两百多位文艺工作者又聚集在一起。这时，在中国文艺工作者的邀请下，阿塞拜疆加盟共和国人民演员裴布托夫演唱了阿塞拜疆民歌——影片“货郎与小姐”的插曲和
    “我的温柔的”；并演唱了他在最近学会的中国民歌“在那遥远的地方”。他的感情丰富、技术纯熟的演唱，充分表达了歌曲的民族色彩。接着，奥布拉兹卓夫又对全体到会的文艺工作者表演木偶戏剧节目。他们的表演都受到中国文艺工作者极大的欢迎。
    座谈会继续了四小时，会上的热烈愉快的空气，具体地表现了中苏两国人民的伟大友谊。
