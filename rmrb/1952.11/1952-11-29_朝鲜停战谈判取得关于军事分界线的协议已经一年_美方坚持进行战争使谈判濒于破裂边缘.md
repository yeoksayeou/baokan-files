(Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, November 28th) It has been a year since the agreement on the specific determination of the military demarcation line, the second item on the agenda of the Korean armistice talks, was reached on November 27th. Over the past year, the U.S. side has attempted to use "military pressure" to force our side to accept its various unreasonable demands, but has been met with bloody noses in the face of the increasingly powerful Korean and Chinese People's forces.

Originally, according to the agreement on the second item on the agenda, if the armistice agreement was signed within thirty days after the agreement was reached, the already determined military demarcation line would not be changed. People all over the world, including the American people, had eagerly anticipated the signing of the armistice agreement within these thirty days. But now twelve thirty-day periods have passed; due to the U.S. side's fear of the arrival of peace, and its planned obstruction and sabotage, the armistice negotiations have not only failed to succeed, but have also been on the verge of collapse.

In the lengthy discussions on the third and fourth agenda items, the U.S. side has consistently been obsessed with so-called "military pressure" and insisted on various unreasonable demands. Former U.S. chief negotiator Joy once openly boasted: "Relentless military pressure is the stimulus for the rapid attainment of agreements on other agenda items." But the actual result of this losing gamble by the U.S. side is that it suffered heavy casualties and gained nothing. From December of last year to October of this year, the U.S. side suffered a total of more than 212,000 casualties, of which more than 94,000 were American troops. Although the U.S. side has paid such a large number of casualties, it has been unable to advance a single step from the already determined military demarcation line, while the Korean and Chinese People's forces have generally pushed the battle line southward in counter-attacks.

More noteworthy is that under the blows of the increasingly powerful Korean and Chinese People's forces, the U.S. side's "military pressure" has failed more and more miserably. This can be seen from the sharp increase in U.S. casualties. The monthly casualties of the U.S. side in June, July, and August this year were more than twice the casualties in December last year. It increased to more than three times in September, and even more to more than six times in October, exceeding the total casualties in the half year from December last year to May this year. The multiple of increase in U.S. troop casualties is also roughly the same. In the recent 24-day battle for Shangganling north of Jinhua, the U.S. side suffered more than 18,000 casualties. Even American news agencies were forced to admit that the loss of U.S. personnel and the consumption of materials in this battle were second only to the losses they suffered during their retreat from northern Korea in 1950. Regarding the fate of the U.S. military in future battles, the Associated Press said very pessimistically: "Fighting again is just an expenditure and there will be no gain."

The losses of the invading U.S. Air Force and Navy are also increasing. For example, the number of U.S. aircraft shot down and damaged in October this year was twice that in August this year and 2.6 times that in December last year. Now even the American generals who are frantically clamoring for "sea and air attacks" have to admit dejectedly that it is "impossible" to destroy the supply lines of the Korean and Chinese side with the air force and navy.

The agreement on the second agenda item reached a year ago should already be a painful lesson for the U.S. side, which is obsessed with war. As everyone knows, during the discussion of the military demarcation line issue, the U.S. side, under the pretext of its so-called "superiority in naval and air power," insisted on demanding the cession of 12,000 square kilometers of North Korean territory, delaying the negotiations for four months. After suffering a disastrous defeat in the summer and autumn offensives, and suffering 250,000 casualties, they had to return to the negotiating table and accept our fair and reasonable plan, reaching an agreement on the military demarcation line. But the U.S. side has not become even slightly sober as a result, and has buried thousands of young people from the United States and accomplice countries in the mountains of Korea over the past year, and still insists on continuing the war today.

Sooner or later, the U.S. side must accept this historical lesson, either honestly solving the prisoner-of-war issue in accordance with the Geneva Convention and the draft armistice agreement, and realizing peace in Korea; or suffering greater failures and paying more casualties, while still never being able to realize its unreasonable demands.

### 朝鲜停战谈判取得关于军事分界线的协议已经一年  美方坚持进行战争使谈判濒于破裂边缘

    朝鲜停战谈判取得关于军事分界线的协议已经一年
    美方坚持进行战争使谈判濒于破裂边缘
    【新华社开城二十八日电】到十一月二十七日，朝鲜停战谈判第二项议程，即军事分界线的具体确定，达成协议已经一年了。这一年来，美方企图用“军事压力”迫使我方接受其种种无理要求，结果在日益强大的朝中人民部队面前碰得头破血流。
    本来，根据第二项议程的协议，如果在协议达成以后三十天之内停战协定签字，则已经确定的军事分界线将不再予以变更。全世界人民，包括美国人民在内，都曾热切地期待着停战协定在这三十天内签字。但是现在十二个三十天已经过去；由于美方害怕和平的到来，有计划地进行阻挠和破坏，停战谈判不但没有成功，而且已经濒于破裂的边缘。
    在第三项和第四项议程的冗长讨论中，美方一贯迷恋所谓“军事压力”，坚持各种无理主张。前美方谈判首席代表乔埃就曾公开吹嘘：“无情的军事压力是促成对其它议程项目迅速获得协议的刺激物”。但是美方这个赔本赌博的实际结果是自己伤亡惨重而一无所得。从去年十二月到今年十月，美方伤亡共二十一万二千多名，其中美军占九万四千多名。美方虽然付出了如此大量的伤亡，但无法从已经确定的军事分界线前进一步，而朝中人民部队则在反击战中，一般都已把战线向南推移了。
    更值得注意的是：在日益强大的朝中人民部队的打击下，美方的“军事压力”失败得愈来愈惨。这从美方伤亡数字激剧增加就看得出来。今年六、七、八月份美方每月的伤亡，为去年十二月份伤亡的二倍多。九月份增至三倍以上，十月份则更增加到六倍多，超过了自去年十二月到今年五月半年内伤亡的总和。其中美军伤亡增加的倍数也大体相同。在最近金化以北上甘岭二十四天争夺战中，美方的伤亡就达到一万八千多名。连美国通讯社也被迫承认：这次战斗中美方人员的损失和物资的消耗，仅次于一九五零年它们在朝鲜北部溃退时的损失。对美军在今后战斗中的命运，美联社十分悲观地说：“再打只是支出而已，不会有什么收获的。”
    侵朝美国空军和海军的损失也一样愈来愈大。例如今年十月份美机被打落打伤的数目为今年八月份的二倍，为去年十二月的二点六倍。现在连疯狂叫嚣“海空攻击”的美国将军们也不得不泄气地承认：要用空军和海军摧毁朝中方面的供应线是“办不到的事”。
    一年以前达成的第二项议程协议，对迷恋战争的美方应该已经是一个惨痛教训。大家知道：在军事分界线问题讨论的过程中，美方曾以所谓“海空军优势”为藉口，坚持要求割取北朝鲜领土一万二千平方公里，把谈判拖延了四个月。他们在发动的夏季攻势和秋季攻势遭到惨败，伤亡二十五万人后，才不得不回到会议桌上来，接受我方公平合理的方案，达成了军事分界线的协议。但是美方并没有因此而稍为清醒，一年来又把成千累万的美国和帮凶国家的青年葬送在朝鲜的群山中，而且到今天仍坚持继续战争。
    美方迟早必须接受这个历史教训，或者是老老实实按照日内瓦公约和停战协定草案解决战俘问题，实现朝鲜和平；或者就是遭受更大的失败，付出更多的伤亡，而仍然永远无法实现其无理要求。
