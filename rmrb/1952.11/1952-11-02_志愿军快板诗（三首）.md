Volunteer Army Clapper Rhyme Poems
   (Three Poems)
    Searchlight
    Liu Qingfu, Zhang Jinsheng
	The searchlight calls out to Big Brother, calling to Big Brother, the anti-aircraft gun. You are performing meritorious service on the battlefield, scaring the enemy planes like startled birds. The anti-aircraft gun calls out to Brother, calling to Brother to come and illuminate quickly. We two fight enemy planes at night, with high skills in joint operations. You illuminate first, I fire the cannon, knocking them down one after another.
    Little Steel Drill
    Qin Jiazhi
	Little steel drill, sharp and pointy, my specialty is drilling inside. No matter how hard the stone, drill a few holes in it. Put explosives inside, the detonator placed slightly off-center, the fuse leads the way, and the stone blossoms outward. After the smoke clears, go in, the cart will move the stones, dig tunnels to kill the enemy, and write the name on the merit book.
    Night March
    Liang Shuying
	The moon is bright and the stars are sparse, the south wind blows, the highway is really lively. Everywhere are cheering squads, singing, playing ball, and telling jokes. Little Luo's malaria has relapsed, and the company commander helps him carry his backpack. Little Luo stubbornly refuses, he says: For the company commander to carry my backpack, what would that look like? The company commander bends down and says softly: Little Luo, what are you shy about? We are all class brothers. (Attached picture)

    志愿军快板诗
   （三首）
    探照灯
    刘庆福　张金胜探照灯把大哥叫，叫声大哥高射炮，你在战场立功劳，打得飞机像惊弓的鸟。高射炮把兄弟叫，叫兄弟你快来照，咱俩夜间打敌机，联合作战本领高。你先照，我打炮，一架一架往下掉。
    小钢钻
    秦家治小钢钻，尖又尖，我的特长是往里钻。不管石头多么硬，给它钻上几个眼。炸药放到里面去，雷管放的偏一点，导火索把路来领，石头开花往外掀。硝烟一过就进去，小车就把石头搬，挖好坑道杀敌人，立功簿上把名填。
    夜行军
    梁书映月明星稀南风刮，公路可真热闹啦。到处都是啦啦队，唱歌碰球说笑话，小罗疟疾又复发，连长帮他把背包拿。小罗硬是不答应，他说：连长给我拿背包，那像什么话。连长弯腰细语道：小罗腼腆啥？咱们都是阶级弟兄嘛。（附图片）
