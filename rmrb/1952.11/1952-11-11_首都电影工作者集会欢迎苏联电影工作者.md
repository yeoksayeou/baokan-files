Xinhua News Agency, 10th. A gathering of capital film workers was held at the Capital Cinema on the morning of the 10th to welcome the delegation of Soviet film artists.

The head of the Soviet film artists' delegation, Fyodorov, and members Ladynina, Chirkov, Petrov, Smirnova, and Pavlov were invited to attend the welcoming gathering. Mr. Sford, Chief Representative of the Soviet Film Export Company in China, also attended the gathering.

The welcoming gathering was presided over by Wang Lansi, Deputy Director of the Film Bureau of the Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government. Representatives from all aspects of film, including screenwriters, directors, actors, film music, newsreels, photography, and film administration, such as Tian Fang, Cai Chusheng, Shi Dongshan, Zhang Min, Shui Hua, Cheng Yin, Wang Zhenzhi, Yu Min, He Shide, Xu Xiaobing, Chen Ge, Hu Peng, Yu Lan, Chen Bo, Yu Ji, and Tian Hua, representatives from the Film Studio of the General Political Department of the People's Revolutionary Military Commission of the Central People's Government and the Film Department of the General Political Department's Cultural Department, and staff members from the Film Bureau of the Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government, Beijing Film Studio, Film Script Creation Institute, Film School, China Film Corporation, and China Film Equipment Company, totaling more than 1,200 people, participated. The heads of the Northeast Film Studio, Shanghai Film Studio, and Shanghai United Film Studio, who recently came to Beijing, also attended the welcoming meeting.

The meeting began amidst warm applause and the shouting of "Stalin - Mao Zedong!"

Wang Lansi introduced the representatives of the Soviet film artists' delegation one by one and expressed a warm welcome to the Soviet film artists' delegation on behalf of the capital film workers.

In an atmosphere of enthusiastic friendship and sustained applause, the six representatives of the Soviet film artists' delegation rose to speak one after another. Fyodorov, Member of the Board of the Film Division of the Soviet Council of Ministers and Director of the Scientific and Educational Film Administration, spoke first. He said: The Soviet people are fighting together with the working people of the world to defend world peace. In this great struggle, the film industries of the Soviet Union, China, and the New Democratic countries have played a tremendous role. Films showing how the working people build a communist society and exposing the conspiracies of warmongers in Soviet films demonstrate that the Soviet people are eager for peace and oppose war.

Then, Soviet People's Artist and Deputy to the Supreme Soviet Chirkov pointed out, based on his own personal experience, that actors must delve into real life to play the roles they are supposed to play well. Soviet People's Artist and lead actress of famous films such as "Happy Life" and "Siberian Symphony" Ladynina also believed that only by constantly observing and experiencing in real life can one improve one's acting skills and express the real life of the people. Film screenwriter Smirnova also pointed out from her creation of famous dramas such as "Village School Teacher" and "Village Doctor" that only by learning from real life can one deeply portray the life of the people and create educational works. Pavlov, Honored Art Worker of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic and photographer, praised the achievements of the new Chinese film and hoped that Chinese film workers would work harder to create films that more deeply and powerfully express the life of the people. The famous director Petrov explained in his famous films such as "Peter the Great" and "The Battle of Stalingrad" that the heroic combat deeds depicted in Soviet films are all to encourage the people to strike at aggressors and defend peace.

Finally, Cai Chusheng, Director of the Film Bureau's Art Committee, delivered a speech, saying: Chinese film workers have always been learning from Soviet film workers and have received a lot of help. In the future, they will learn more from the Soviet Union.

    首都电影工作者集会欢迎苏联电影工作者
    【新华社十日讯】十日上午首都电影工作者在首都电影院举行欢迎苏联电影艺术工作者代表团大会。
    苏联电影艺术工作者代表团团长费道罗夫，团员拉迪尼娜、契尔柯夫、彼得罗夫、斯米尔诺娃、巴甫洛夫都应邀出席了欢迎大会。出席欢迎大会的还有苏联影片输出公司驻华总代表处总代表史福德。
    欢迎大会由中央人民政府文化部电影局副局长王阑西主持。参加欢迎的有电影编剧、导演、演员、电影音乐、新闻电影、摄影、电影行政等各方面的代表田方、蔡楚生、史东山、章泯、水华、成荫、王震之、于敏、何士德、徐肖冰、陈戈、胡朋、于蓝，中央人民政府人民革命军事委员会总政治部电影制片厂和总政治部文化部电影处的代表陈播、虞棘、田华，以及中央人民政府文化部电影局、北京电影制片厂、电影剧本创作所、电影学校、中国影片经理公司、中国电影器材公司的工作人员共一千二百多人。参加欢迎会的还有最近来北京的东北电影制片厂、上海电影制片厂、上海联合电影制片厂的负责人。
    大会在热烈的掌声中和“斯大林——毛泽东！”的口号声中开始。
    王阑西分别介绍了苏联电影艺术工作者代表团代表们，并代表首都电影工作者向苏联电影艺术工作者代表团表示热烈的欢迎。
    在热情洋溢的友好空气中和经久不息的掌声中，苏联电影艺术工作者代表团六位代表先后起立讲话。苏联部长会议电影事业部部务会议委员及科学教育片管理局局长费道罗夫首先发言，他说：苏联人民跟全世界劳动人民在一起为保卫世界和平而斗争着。在这个伟大的斗争中，苏联、中国以及新民主主义国家的电影事业，起了极大的作用。在苏联电影中表现劳动人民如何建设共产主义社会和揭露战争贩子阴谋等等的影片，这都说明了苏联人民是渴望和平、反对战争的。
    接着，苏联人民演员、苏联最高苏维埃代表契尔柯夫根据他自己亲身的体验，指出演员必须深入实际生活，才能扮演好所要演出的角色。苏联人民演员、“幸福的生活”、“西伯利亚交响曲”等名片的主演人拉迪尼娜也认为只有在实际生活中不断地观察体验，才能提高自己的演技，表现人民的现实生活。电影剧本创作家斯米尔诺娃从她创作“乡村女教师”、“乡村医生”等名剧中，也指出只有向现实生活学习才能深刻地刻画人民的生活，创造出有教育意义的作品来。俄罗斯苏维埃联邦社会主义共和国荣誉艺术工作者、摄影师巴甫洛夫在发言中盛赞新中国电影的成就，并希望中国的电影工作者更多更好地努力创造出更深刻更有力表现人民生活的电影来。名导演彼德罗夫就他所导演的“彼得大帝”、“斯大林格勒大会战”等名片中，说明苏联影片所描写的英雄战斗事迹，都是为了鼓舞人民打击侵略者，保卫和平。
    最后电影局艺术委员会主任蔡楚生致词，他说：中国电影工作者一直是在向苏联电影工作者学习，并得到很多的帮助，今后还要更多地向苏联学习。
