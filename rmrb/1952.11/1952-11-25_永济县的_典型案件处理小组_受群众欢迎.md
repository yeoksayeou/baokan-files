    The "Typical Case Handling Group" of Yongji County is Welcomed by the Masses

    Editor: In the judicial reform movement in Yongji County, Shanxi Province, the judicial reform staff organized four "typical case handling groups" to work in the countryside, which was warmly welcomed by the masses. In the divorce case of Ding Xiaoyou and Feng Aiwa in Sifeng Village, Second District, the County People's Court previously did not act in accordance with the spirit of the Marriage Law, and wrongly awarded the child, who should have been given to the woman, to the man. Village cadres went to the court to request a retrial, but the court refused. After this retrial, the masses reflected: "It is right to give the child to the woman." Farmers Wang Zhideng and two others from Xitaiyang Village, Third District, sued the rich peasant Wang Chongxuan (a counter-revolutionary who has been executed) over a public roadbed issue. They went back and forth between the county and district five times over two years, but the issue was not resolved. Instead, the County People's Court biasedly listened to District Cadre Yang Zhanshan's one-sided account, saying that Wang Zhideng and the other two were members of the pseudo "Iron Blood Party" and detained Wang and the others as "suspects." Because the materials were not verified, the "typical case handling group" released Wang Zhideng and the others on bail as soon as they arrived in the village, saying they could be summoned at any time. The masses reflected: "Now we see the light of day! The Communist Party and Chairman Mao are indeed not wronging good people." Wang Zhideng and others said gratefully: "Chairman Mao is so good. If the judicial reform had not been carried out, we would still be wearing the hats of 'suspects'!" The masses also reflected: "In the past, complaints were ignored, but now they are handled as soon as they are raised." "The faces of the reformed court cadres have changed (their attitude is better)." Su Yumin

    永济县的“典型案件处理小组”受群众欢迎
    编辑同志：山西省永济县在司法改革运动中，由司法改革工作人员组织四个“典型案件处理小组”下乡工作，受到群众热烈欢迎。二区四冯村丁小有和冯爱娃离婚案，以前县人民法院不依据婚姻法精神，把应该判给女方的小孩判给了男方，村干部去法院要求改判，法院不肯。这次改判后，群众反映：“还是判给女方对。”三区西太阳村农民王智平等三人为公共路基事和富农王崇选（反革命分子，已枪毙）起诉，前后二年，往返县、区五次，都没有解决，而县人民法院反偏听区干部杨占山一面之辞，说王智平等三人是伪“铁血党”党员，以“嫌疑”犯的名义把王等扣押起来。因材料没证实，这次“典型案件处理小组”到村后，即让王智平等找保释放，随传随到。群众反映：“这下见天啦！共产党、毛主席就是不屈好人。”王智平等感激地说：“毛主席就是好，要不进行司法改革，我们的‘嫌疑’帽子还老戴着哩！”群众还反映：“过去是告下不理，现在提出来就办。”“改革过的法院干部脸换了（态度好了）。”  苏裕民
