    Li Baosheng and Others Create New Methods for Grain Storage

    Editor: The moving workers in Baoding City, Hebei Province, created a rectangular, multi-hole, ventilated stack, saving a lot of money for the country.

    On September 6th, the sorghum stored in the second warehouse of the Baoding City Grain Company heated up to 44 degrees Celsius (it would mold at 50 degrees), and had to be "aired" before it could be stacked. The moving workers Li Baosheng, Zhao Xueqiao, and others working in the warehouse, based on their experience, believed that if a ventilated stack were created, airing would not be necessary. After consideration and research, the company accepted their suggestion. Within one day, they built a rectangular, multi-hole, ventilated stack. The characteristic of the stack is that each bag of grain is ventilated, and people can crawl in to inspect and apply insecticide powder. Using the ventilated stack, the temperature of the grain was reduced from 44 degrees to 27 degrees within a week, avoiding damage to the grain.

    The success of creating the ventilated stack not only saved "airing" costs of 360 jin of millet, but also kept the grain in good condition.

    李保生等创保管粮食新方法
    编辑同志：河北保定市搬运工人创造了长方形多孔透风垛，为国家节省很多资财。
    九月六日，保定市粮食公司存放在第二仓库的红粮发热到四十四度（五十度就要霉烂），必须“过风”后，才能码垛。该仓库工作的搬运工人李保生、赵雪樵等根据自己的经验，认为如果码透风垛，就可不必过风。该公司经过考虑和研究之后，接受了他们的意见。在一天内，他们就码成了长方形多孔透风垛。垛的特点是每包粮食都透风，并可钻进人去检查和打杀虫药粉。利用透风垛，在一星期内使粮食的热度由四十四度降到二十七度，避免了粮食的损坏。
    创造透风垛的成功，不但节省了“过风”费三百六十斤小米，而且使粮食保持了良好的状态。
