Xinhua News Agency, Korean Kimhwa Front, November 27th: The Chinese People's Volunteer Army's air defense operations in the Shangganling area have achieved a tremendous victory just like the ground battles. In the thirty-three days from October 14th to November 15th, they shot down or damaged 208 enemy planes (an average of 6.3 planes per day). Among them, 53 enemy planes were shot down, which is equivalent to five U.S. Air Force squadrons. The vast majority of these shot-down enemy planes fell within our army's front lines.

Since Van Fleet reluctantly launched an offensive in the Shangganling area, the enemy has dispatched a large number of aircraft every day to carry out frantic bombing and strafing of the area, exhausting all their strength to support their ground forces. However, the American aerial bandits not only failed to save their ground forces from defeat, but also suffered heavy blows themselves.

On the mountains near Shangganling, many of our army's anti-aircraft guns engaged in fierce battles with enemy planes every day. One morning, eight enemy jet fighters came to attack our army's hilltop position. Our army's anti-aircraft artillery immediately fired dense artillery fire at the enemy planes. In less than half an hour, three enemy planes were shot down, and the remaining five were also wounded.

Our army's infantry anti-aircraft gunners also made contributions in the fight against the American aerial bandits. The brave young machine gunner Jia Ruqiao once engaged in a tense battle with four enemy planes alone. At that time, the enemy planes dived and strafed him fiercely. He kept his eyes fixed on the enemy planes. When the last enemy plane dived down, he pulled the trigger of the machine gun and immediately shot the plane down from mid-air onto our army's position nearby. Another rifleman named Xiao Wenhan also shot down an enemy plane with only four bullets.

The American aerial bandits were as embarrassed as the American infantry, who were terrified by our army's artillery fire. According to American news agencies, whenever these aerial bandits "luckily" returned to the airport, trembling and driving planes riddled with bullet holes, they would jump out of the plane and say: "The sky north of Kimhwa is extremely terrible."

Air defense operations have played a significant role in ensuring the victory of our army's entire battle on the Kimhwa front. The enemy planes were afraid of our army's anti-aircraft fire and dared not carry out low-altitude dives, so the accuracy of their bombing was greatly reduced. The enemy's artillery spotter planes dared not easily reconnoiter over our positions, thus greatly reducing the accuracy of the enemy's ground artillery fire. Under the cover of anti-aircraft firepower, our artillery was able to start daytime firing, further exerting the power of artillery fire. Under the cover of anti-aircraft firepower, our army's vehicles and transport teams were also able to transport ammunition and supplies to the front lines day and night.

Xinhua News Agency, Korean Kimhwa Front, November 27th: The comfort delegation sent by the directly subordinate units of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army leadership organs has arrived at the Kimhwa front to comfort the combat troops who have won brilliant victories in the Shangganling area. The comfort delegation carried more than 9,000 comfort items and more than 700 letters of sympathy voluntarily donated by cadres and soldiers from the directly subordinate units.

Since the beginning of the battle in the Shangganling area, the combat troops have continuously received deep concern and warm condolences from fraternal units and rear organs. Under the slogan "Everything for the front," fraternal units and rear organs sent many letters of sympathy and a large number of canned foods, fruits, cigarettes, sugar, and daily necessities such as soap, towels, woolen sweaters, shoes, and socks to the heroic fighters fighting in the Shangganling area.

When the comfort delegation from the directly subordinate units of the Volunteer Army leadership organs arrived at the Kimhwa front, the combat troops in the Shangganling area held a welcome evening. The leaders of the troops expressed their warm gratitude at the meeting on behalf of all commanders and fighters for the encouragement and concern of the Volunteer Army leaders, the directly subordinate units of the Volunteer Army leadership organs, and the fraternal units, and stated that they would make persistent efforts to give the American aggressors even heavier blows.

    上甘岭志愿军三十三天击落击伤敌机二百多架
    【新华社朝鲜金化前线二十七日电】中国人民志愿军在上甘岭地区的对空作战如同地面战斗一样地取得了巨大胜利，在十月十四日到十一月十五日的三十三天中共击落击伤敌机二百零八架（平均每天六点三架）。其中被击落的敌机有五十三架，这个数目等于五个美国空军中队。这些被击落的敌机绝大多数都落在我军阵线以内。
    自从范佛里特在上甘岭地区勉强发动攻势以来，敌军每天出动大量飞机向这个地区进行疯狂轰炸和扫射，用尽力量支援他们的地面部队。但是，美国空中强盗不仅不能挽救他们地面部队的失败，而且自身也受到了惨重的打击。
    在上甘岭附近的山岭上，我军的许多高射炮每天都和敌机进行激烈的战斗。一天早晨，敌人八架喷气战斗机来袭击我军一个山头阵地，我军高射炮兵立即向敌机发射密集的炮火，不到半个小时，敌机就有三架被打落，其余的五架也都受了伤。
    我军步兵对空射击手也在和美国空中强盗作战中创立了功绩。勇敢的青年机枪手贾汝巧曾经单独和四架敌机进行了一次紧张的战斗。当时敌机凶恶地向他进行俯冲扫射，他两眼紧紧地盯住敌机，等到最后一架敌机俯冲下来的时候，他扣动了机关枪的扳机，马上把那架敌机打得从半空中掉到附近的我军阵地上来。另一个名叫肖文汉的步枪手，也曾仅仅用四发子弹就打落了一架敌机。
    美国空中强盗像被我军炮火打得丧魂落魄的美国步兵一样狼狈。据美国通讯社报道，这些空中强盗每当战战兢兢地驾驶着弹痕累累的飞机“幸运地”回到机场时，一跳下飞机就说：“金化以北的天空可怕极了。”
    对空作战对于保证我军在金化前线整个战斗的胜利发生了很大的作用。敌机害怕我军的对空射击而不敢进行低空俯冲，因而其投弹的准确性就大大减低了。敌人的炮兵校正机不敢轻易地在我阵地上空侦察，因此也大大地减弱了敌军地面炮火的准确性。而我军炮兵在高射火力的掩护下却能开始实行白天射击，更大地发挥了炮火的威力。在高射火力的掩护下，我军汽车和运输队也能够日夜不停地将弹药、物资运上前线阵地。
    【新华社朝鲜金化前线二十七日电】中国人民志愿军领导机关直属队派出的慰问团已来到金化前线慰问在上甘岭地区获得辉煌胜利的作战部队。慰问团携带了直属队各单位干部和战士们自动捐献的九千多件慰问品和七百多封慰问信。
    在上甘岭地区的作战部队自战斗开始以来，不断受到各兄弟部队和后方机关的深切关怀与热烈慰问。各兄弟部队和后方机关在“一切为了前线”的口号下，把许多慰问信及大批罐头食品、水果、香烟、糖和肥皂、毛巾、绒衣、鞋袜等日用品送到了在上甘岭地区英勇作战的战士们的手中。
    志愿军领导机关直属队慰问团来到金化前线时，上甘岭地区作战部队举行了欢迎晚会。部队首长在会上代表全体指挥员、战斗员热烈感谢志愿军首长、志愿军领导机关直属队和各兄弟部队的勉励与关怀，并表示要再接再厉，给美国侵略军以更沉重的打击。
