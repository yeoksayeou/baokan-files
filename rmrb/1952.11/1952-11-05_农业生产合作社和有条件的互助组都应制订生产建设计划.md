Agricultural Production Cooperatives and Mutual Aid Teams with Conditions Should Formulate Production and Construction Plans

    Many villages, agricultural production cooperatives, and mutual aid teams in various regions have already formulated three-year or five-year production and construction plans. The three-year construction plan formulated by Xigou Village, Pingshun, Shanxi is one of the better ones.

    Xigou Village was originally a well-known place of "thick stone and thin soil, lacking all five elements." In recent years, under the leadership of the Party, the production and living standards of the peasants have been greatly improved. However, the peasants' lives are still not affluent enough. After careful calculation and exploring the potential of production from various aspects, they saw a happy future for the construction of the mountainous area, and they are convinced that the total output value can be increased by more than double in three years. The natural conditions in most parts of the country are better than those in Xigou Village, and there is also great production potential that can be tapped in these areas, but many peasants and even leading cadres do not see these potential capabilities, and therefore, they do not see the future of developing production and lack confidence in increasing production. Like Xigou Village, with the formulation of a longer-term production and construction plan, people can clearly see the future of development, see the specific path to a happy life, and can make appropriate arrangements for time, manpower, materials, and land to maximize their effectiveness. Some peasants in Xigou Village had been wanting to move down the mountain before the three-year plan was formulated; after the plan was formulated, they changed from passive to active, determined to fight against nature and turn the mountain沟 into a paradise of "mountains full of fruit trees and fields full of cattle and sheep." If rural areas across the country can do this, fully tap the potential of production, and formulate longer-term construction plans, then a very huge force will be unleashed. Not to mention increasing the total output value by more than double in three years, even if it is increased by a quarter to a half, the face of China's rural areas will be greatly changed.

    The fact that Xigou Village formulated a three-year construction plan makes us more aware of the necessity of organizing. An important condition for Xigou Village to formulate this plan so well is that the vast majority of peasants in the village have joined agricultural, forestry, and animal husbandry production cooperatives. One of the characteristics of the individual economy is its blindness. In places where the individual economy dominates, it is impossible to formulate a good long-term construction plan for the entire village. Because the division of afforestation, animal husbandry, and cultivation areas, the implementation of larger-scale farmland capital construction, and the rational use and cultivation of various talents, etc., can only be done through organization.

### 农业生产合作社和有条件的互助组都应制订生产建设计划

    农业生产合作社和有条件的互助组都应制订生产建设计划
    各地许多村庄、农业生产合作社和互助组，已经制订了三年或五年的生产建设计划。山西平顺西沟村制订的三年建设计划，是其中较好的一个。
    西沟村原是有名的“石厚土薄，五行俱缺”的地方。几年以来，在党的领导下，农民的生产和生活水平已经大大提高了。但是，农民的生活还不够富裕。经过精细计算，从多方面发掘生产的潜在能力，他们看见了建设山区的幸福远景，确信在三年内还可以把生产总值提高一倍以上。全国各地大部分地方的自然条件比西沟村好，在这些地区也有巨大生产潜力可以发挥，但是有许多农民群众、甚至领导干部，却看不见这些潜在能力，因此，也就看不见发展生产的前途，缺乏提高生产的信心。像西沟村这样，订了较长期的生产建设计划，人们就可以清晰地看到发展的前途，看到通到幸福生活的具体的道路，就可以把时间、人力、物力、地力作适当的安排，使它们发挥更大的效能。西沟村有些农民在订三年计划以前一直想搬下山去；订了计划之后就由消极变为积极，决心和自然作斗争，把山沟变成“满山是果林、遍地是牛羊”的乐园。如果全国各地农村都能这样做，充分地发掘生产潜力，订出较长期的建设计划，那就会发挥出来非常巨大的力量。不必说三年中把生产总值提高一倍以上，即使提高四分之一到二分之一，我国农村的面貌就会大大改观。
    西沟村订三年建设计划的事实，使我们更认识了组织起来的必要。西沟村能把这个计划订得很好，一个重要的条件就是全村绝大部分农民已经参加了农林畜牧生产合作社。个体经济的特点之一就是它的盲目性。在个体经济占优势的地方，是不可能把全村的、较长期的建设计划订好的。因为划分造林、畜牧、耕作的区域，进行较大的农田基本建设，合理运用和培养各种不同的人才等等，都是只有组织起来才能办得到的。
