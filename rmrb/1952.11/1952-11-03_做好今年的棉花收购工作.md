    The cooperatives in the cotton-producing areas across the country have overfulfilled the cotton purchasing plan for September and October from September to October 20. This is the result of the continued increase in the patriotic enthusiasm of the vast number of cotton farmers, the implementation of the state's correct cotton price policy, and the improvement of cotton purchasing work by the cooperatives.
    However, this does not mean that there are no problems in this year's cotton purchasing work. On the contrary, in some cooperatives in some areas, there are still quite serious chaotic phenomena: irrational use of funds, a large amount of seed cotton cannot be processed in time, lowering cotton grades, lowering cotton prices, and even restricting purchases and stopping purchases, etc. This phenomenon has caused dissatisfaction among the vast number of cotton farmers and must be resolved.
    The key to these problems is the funding issue. Due to improper use of funds, various other problems have been caused. So, how to solve the funding problem? Some cooperative cadres overemphasize the lack of initial funds and simply hope that the bank will expand loans to meet the cotton farmers' requirements for selling cotton. This is a wrong approach. Another approach, such as the Shahe Cooperative, is to improve the management level of cotton purchasing, accelerate capital turnover, to fully meet the cotton farmers' requirements for selling cotton, which is completely correct. First, it gives full play to the potential power of cotton processing, "receiving, ginning, and delivering at any time," making the capital turnover once every six days, which is twice as fast as the capital turnover rate stipulated by the higher authorities. This most effectively solves the problem of insufficient funds. Some cooperatives with insufficient processing capacity cannot improve their processing capacity, nor are they willing to absorb the processing power outside the cooperative, so they have accumulated a large amount of seed cotton, which is also accumulating a large amount of funds, which is obviously wrong. Second, it mobilized the masses to store cotton. In a month and a half, a total of 408,050 jin of cotton were absorbed from the masses. This is also one of the effective ways to solve the problem of insufficient cotton purchasing funds for cooperatives. Third, it launched a competition campaign in the cotton purchasing work and implemented the spirit of increasing production and practicing economy, which made all kinds of work look new, which is the key to achieving the above achievements.
    The experience of the Shahe County Cooperative in cotton purchasing work is worth learning from by cooperatives in various places. Only by seriously improving the management of cotton purchasing work, improving work efficiency, and carrying out the movement to increase production and practice economy can we meet the cotton farmers' requirements for selling cotton, meet the needs of the country, and strengthen ourselves in cotton purchasing; can we improve our business operations and truly do a good job in cotton purchasing.

### 做好今年的棉花收购工作

    做好今年的棉花收购工作
    全国各产棉区合作社从九月到十月二十日，已超额完成九、十月份收购棉花的计划。这是广大棉农爱国主义热情继续高涨，国家正确的棉价政策的贯彻实行和合作社改进了购棉工作的结果。
    但这并不是说今年的购棉工作中就没有任何问题了。恰恰相反，在部分地区的某些合作社中，还存在着相当严重的混乱现象：资金使用不合理、大量籽棉不能及时加工、压低棉花等级、压低棉价，甚至限制收购、停止收购，等等。这种现象已经引起广大棉农的不满意，必须加以解决。
    这些问题的关键是资金问题。由于资金运用不当，引起了其他各种问题。那末，怎样解决资金问题呢？有些合作社的干部，过分强调铺底资金不足，单纯希望银行扩大贷款，来满足棉农售棉的要求。这是一种错误的作法。另一种做法，如像沙河合作社，则是提高购棉的经营管理水平，加速资金周转，以充分满足棉农的售棉要求，这是完全正确的。第一，它充分发挥了棉花加工的潜在力量，“随收、随轧、随送”，使资金六天周转一次，较上级规定的资金周转率加速了一倍。这就最有效地解决了资金不足的问题。有些加工能力不足的合作社，既不能提高自己的加工能力，又不愿意吸收社外的加工力量，因此积压了大批籽棉，也就是积压了大批资金，这显然是错误的。第二，它发动了群众储存棉花。在一个半月中，共吸收群众存棉四十万八千零五十斤。这也是解决合作社购棉资金不足的有效办法之一。第三，它在购棉工作中开展了竞赛运动，贯彻了增产节约精神，使各种工作气象一新，这是能够取得上述成绩的关键。
    沙河县合作社购棉工作的经验，是值得各地合作社学习的。只有认真地改善购棉工作的经营管理，提高工作效率，开展增产节约运动，才能满足棉农售棉的要求、满足国家的需要，并在购棉中壮大了自己；才能把自己的业务经营提高一步，真正把购棉工作做好。
