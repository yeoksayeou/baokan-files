    Former President of the Yutian County People's Court Examines Bureaucratism

    Editor Comrades: I am the former County Head and concurrently the President of the People's Court of Yutian County, Hebei Province. After the "Reader's Letters" column of the People's Daily published the suggestion "Recommendation to Conduct a Detailed Inspection of the Yutian County People's Court" on August 24th, I, along with comrades from the Tangshan Branch of the Hebei Provincial People's Court and the Tangshan Prefectural Public Security Bureau, went to Yutian County to assist relevant departments in conducting a five-day inspection. The inspection results were basically consistent with the situation reflected by reader Ma Jie. In fact, the illegal and undisciplined phenomena such as torture to extract confessions in the Yutian County People's Court were even more numerous and serious than those reflected by reader Ma Jie. These phenomena occurred during my tenure as County Head and concurrently President of the People's Court of Yutian County. This is inseparable from my bureaucratism. Since taking office in Yutian County, I have not personally inspected the work of the court, and have rarely even inquired about its work. This shows that I am indifferent to judicial work and have a vague stance; I have not realized that judicial work is an effective tool for protecting the interests of the people and consolidating the people's democratic dictatorship. I should bear certain responsibility for these problems in the judicial work of Yutian County. In addition to thanking the readers for their criticism, I request the organization and the administration to give me the punishment I deserve. The above is a preliminary examination. I will seriously study and conduct further examination in the judicial reform movement.

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    玉田县人民法院前院长检查官僚主义
    编辑同志：我是前河北省玉田县县长兼县人民法院院长。当八月二十四日人民日报“读者来信”栏刊出“建议详细检查玉田县人民法院”的意见后，我即同河北省人民法院唐山分院和唐山专署公安处的同志到玉田县协助有关部门进行了五天的检查。检查结果和读者马杰所反映的情况基本上是相符的。实际上，玉田县人民法院的肉刑逼供等违法乱纪现象，比读者马杰所反映的还多还严重。这些现象正是我任玉田县县长兼县人民法院院长期间发生的。这和我的官僚主义是分不开的。我自从在玉田县任职后，并没有亲自到该院检查过工作，甚至很少过问该院工作。这说明我对司法工作漠不关心、立场模糊；没有认识到司法工作就是保护人民利益和巩固人民民主专政的有效工具。玉田县司法工作上的这些问题，我是应该负一定责任的。除了感谢读者的批评外，我请求组织上、行政上给我以应得的处分。以上是一个初步的检查，我当在司法改革运动中认真学习、作进一步的检查。
