The tasks of communist construction, put forward and scientifically elucidated in Comrade Stalin's brilliant work "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR" and in the resolutions of the 19th Party Congress, have aroused a powerful new upsurge in the ideological life of our party. Our cadres and the entire Soviet people have studied these historic documents and mastered Stalin's science of building communism.

Comrade Stalin teaches that only a party that has mastered Marxist-Leninist theory can advance with confidence and guide the working class forward. Conversely, a party that does not master Marxist-Leninist theory can only grope around, lose confidence in its actions, and fail to lead the working class forward.

Our party has achieved victory in the past and present because it has been guided by Marxism-Leninism in all its activities. The Marxist-Leninist theory, creatively developed by our great leader and teacher Comrade Stalin, enables our party to have the ability to determine direction, to understand the internal connections of surrounding events, to foresee the course of events, and to know not only how events are developing now and where they are going, but also how they will develop and where they will go in the future.

Comrade Stalin wrote in his classic work "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR":

"Marxism understands the laws of science—whether they be laws of natural science or laws of political economy—as the reflection of objective processes which operate independently of the will of man. Men can discover these laws, get to know them, study them, reckon with them in their activities and utilize them in the interests of society..."

Our party, having mastered the revealed Marxist-Leninist laws, has practically demonstrated that society is not powerless in the face of laws. Once society recognizes economic laws, it can, relying on them, limit the scope of their operation, utilize them for the benefit of society, and "subjugate" them, just as happens with natural forces and their laws.

The party's future plans, which determine the prospects and paths of our forward movement, are based on knowledge of economic laws and on Comrade Stalin's science of the development of communist society. In order to successfully complete these plans and realize them, our cadres and all Communist Party members should strive to master the science of Marxism-Leninism and draw practical conclusions from it in the daily struggle for the victory of communism.

The 19th Party Congress, which defined the main tasks of the party, paid special attention to the issue of further improving the ideological work of party organizations. Comrade Malenkov said in his report on the work of the Central Committee of the Party: Ideological work is the primary responsibility of the Party, and neglect of this work can cause irreparable damage to the interests of the Party and the state. We must always remember that any weakening of the influence of socialist ideology means the strengthening of the influence of bourgeois ideology.

The party, carrying out the resolutions of the Central Committee and Comrade Stalin's instructions on ideological issues, has significantly improved its work on the ideological front in recent times. Thanks to the intervention of the Party Central Committee, habits and traditions incompatible with the Soviet people have been exposed in many scientific departments, phenomena of closing the door to criticism and adopting an intolerable attitude towards criticism have been exposed, and various manifestations of bourgeois ideology and various vulgar distortions have been exposed and shattered. Discussions on philosophy, biology, physiology, linguistics, political economy, etc., revealed serious shortcomings in the ideological aspects of various scientific departments, promoted the development of criticism and debate of opinions, and played an important role in the development of science.

The Party pointed out at the 19th Congress that, until now, the phenomenon of neglecting ideological work still exists in many party organizations. As a result, this work falls behind the tasks of the Party, and in some organizations, this work is left unattended.

"Some of our party organizations only pay attention to economic affairs," Comrade Malenkov said, "and forget about ideological issues, they put these issues aside. Even advanced party organizations such as the Moscow party organization do not pay enough attention to ideological work. This cannot but cause adverse effects. Wherever no attention is paid to ideological issues, fertile ground is created for the revival of hostile views and ideas. Alien elements, remnants of various anti-Leninist groups that have been crushed by the Party, want to seize those departments of ideological work that the party organizations have not paid attention to for some reason, weakening the party's leadership and influence, and use such departments to promote their line, revive and spread various non-Marxist 'views' and 'ideas.'"

The organization of Marxist-Leninist propaganda is even more unsatisfactory. Due to insufficient leadership of ideological work and lack of supervision of the content of this work, serious distortions are often found in books, newspapers and magazines, as well as in the work of scientific institutions and other institutions. In some scientific departments, the monopoly of individual groups of scientists has not been completely eradicated. They exclude the growing new forces, do not accept criticism, and attempt to solve scientific problems by administrative methods.

Some of our leading cadres have forgotten their primary obligation to the Party: to strive to improve their own awareness, to systematically enrich their Marxist-Leninist knowledge, and to enrich themselves with the historical experience of the Party.

Experience proves that a leader can only be competent in the tasks of our Party if he tirelessly studies advanced revolutionary theory, creatively masters Marxism-Leninism, and trains and perfects his qualities as a worker of the Leninist and Stalinist type. A person who is ideologically backward, lives according to memorized formulas, loses the sense of novelty, and cannot correctly analyze the domestic and international situation will sooner or later be abandoned by real life.

The issue of Marxist-Leninist education for cadres and all Communist Party members should become the central issue of constant attention for every party organization. Serious shortcomings in organizing the Party's educational work should be eliminated. The Party Constitution adopted by the 19th Party Congress requires every Party organ to strengthen the leadership of the Marxist-Leninist study of Party members and alternate members, and to strengthen the communist education of the working people.

Under modern conditions, when our country is realizing the gradual transition from socialism to communism, the significance of ideological work is particularly enhanced. Communism cannot be built without overcoming the remnants of capitalism in people's minds.

On the ideological front, the high combat effectiveness of party organizations and the political vigilance of Communist Party members are particularly needed. We must wage a relentless struggle against the erosion of views, ideas, and sentiments that run counter to us. These things come from abroad, from capitalist countries, and also from within the country, from the remnants of groups hostile to the Soviet regime that have not yet been eradicated by our Party.

In the Soviet state, socialist ideology occupies a dominant position, and Marxism-Leninism is the unbreakable foundation of this ideology. Our Party promotes and cultivates a high sense of social responsibility among the masses, educating the working people in the spirit of Soviet patriotism and the friendship of all nationalities, and in the spirit of concern for the interests of the state.

In the report on the work summary of the Central Committee of the Party made at the 19th Congress, the tasks of eliminating the phenomenon of despising ideological work, carrying out resolute struggles against liberalism and indifference towards ideological errors and distortions, and systematically improving and improving the ideological and political cultivation of our cadres were stipulated for party organizations at all levels. We must develop socialist culture, science, literature, and art and bring them to perfection, and mobilize all the tools of political and ideological education, our propaganda, agitation work, and newspapers and periodicals, to improve the ideological cultivation of Communist Party members and enhance the political vigilance and political awareness of workers, peasants, and intellectuals.

The historical resolutions of the 19th Party Congress and Comrade Stalin's brilliant works are powerful ideological weapons of our Party in the struggle for the victory of communism. To arm our cadres and all Communist Party members with the resolutions of the Congress and Comrade Stalin's invincible thought on the theory of communist construction is the primary task of every party organization. Raising the level of ideological work is a necessary condition for the successful realization of the gigantic tasks determined by the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.

    消灭轻视思想工作的现象
    ——苏联“真理报”十月二十七日社论
    在斯大林同志的天才著作“苏联社会主义经济问题”中和第十九次党代表大会的决议中提出和科学地阐述了的共产主义建设的任务，唤起了我党思想生活的强大的新高涨。我们的干部和全体苏联人民研究了这些历史性的文件，掌握了斯大林的建设共产主义的科学。
    斯大林同志教导说，只有掌握了马克思—列宁主义理论的政党，才能满怀信心地前进并引导工人阶级前进。相反，党不掌握马克思—列宁主义的理论，便只好摸索着四处徘徊，在自己的行动中失掉信心，不能领导工人阶级前进。
    我们的党过去和现在所以取得胜利，是因为它在其全部活动中受着马克思—列宁主义的指导。为伟大的领袖和导师斯大林同志创造性地发展了的马克思—列宁主义的理论，使得我们党能够有决定方向的能力，能够了解周围事变的内在联系，预见事变的进程，不仅知道事变现在怎样发展和向何处发展，而且知道将来它们将怎样发展和向何处发展。
    斯大林同志在其经典著作“苏联社会主义经济问题”中写道：
    “马克思主义把科学法则——无论是指自然科学法则或政治经济学法则都一样——了解为不以人们的意志为转移的客观过程的反映。人们能发现这些法则，认识它们，研究它们，在自己的行动中估计到它们，利用它们来为社会谋福利……”
    我们的党掌握了已被揭示的马克思—列宁主义的法则，实际地证明了：社会在法则面前不是无能为力的，社会认识了经济法则以后，依靠着它们，就能够限制它们发生作用的范围，利用它们来为社会谋福利，并“驾御”它们，正如在自然力及其法则方面所发生的情形一样。
    规定我们的前进运动的远景和道路的党的将来的计划，是以经济法则的知识为依据的，是以斯大林同志制订的关于共产主义社会发展的科学为依据的。为要顺利地完成这些计划，实现它们，我们的干部和全体共产党员应当努力掌握马克思—列宁主义的科学，在为争取共产主义胜利的日常斗争中由它作出实际的结论。
    确定党的主要任务的第十九次党代表大会，对于进一步改善党组织的思想工作的问题给予了特别的注意。马林科夫同志关于党中央委员会的工作的报告中说：思想工作是党的首要职责，不重视这种工作就可能给党和国家的利益造成无法弥补的损失。我们必须时刻记住：社会主义思想影响的任何削弱，都意味着资产阶级思想影响的增强。
    党执行着中央委员会的决议和斯大林同志关于思想问题的指示，最近期间在思想战线上显著地改进了自己的工作。由于党中央委员会的过问，在许多科学部门中已揭露了与苏维埃人不相容的习惯和传统，揭发了关闭批评之门和对待批评采取不可容忍的态度的现象，揭穿并粉碎了资产阶级思想的各种表现以及各种庸俗歪曲的现象。关于哲学、生物学、生理学、语言学、政治经济学等的讨论揭发了各种科学部门在思想方面的严重缺点，推动了批评和意见的争论的开展，在科学发展中起了重要的作用。
    党在第十九次代表大会上指出，直到如今，在许多党组织中还存在着不重视思想工作的现象，因此，这种工作就落在党的任务后面，有些组织中，这种工作处于无人照管的状态。
    “我们某些党组织只顾经济事务，——马林科夫同志说，——而忘记了思想问题，它们把这些问题搁置在一边。甚至先进的党组织如莫斯科党组织，对于思想工作也注意得不够。这就不能不引起不良的影响。凡是对思想问题不加注意的地方，就给敌对的观点和观念的复活创造了肥土沃壤。异己分子，形形色色已被党粉碎了的反列宁主义集团的残余分子，都想抓住党组织因为某种原故未加重视，而使党的领导与影响削弱了的那些思想工作部门，利用这样的部门来宣传他们的路线，复活并散布各种非马克思主义的‘观点’和‘观念’”。
    马克思—列宁主义的宣传组织得更为不能令人满意。由于对思想工作的领导不够以及对于这种工作的内容缺乏监督，书籍、报纸和杂志中以及科学机关和其他机关的工作中常常发现严重的歪曲。在一些科学部门中，个别科学家集团的垄断现象还没有完全根除，它们排斥生长中的新生的力量，不接受批评，并企图用行政方法来解决科学问题。
    我们一部分领导干部忘记了对党的首要义务：努力提高自己的觉悟，系统地充实自己的马克思—列宁主义的知识，用党的历史经验来丰富自己。
    经验证明：一个领导者只有不倦地学习先进的革命理论，创造性地掌握马克思—列宁主义，锻炼自己的列宁与斯大林式工作者的品质并使之臻于完美的地步，才能胜任我们党的任务。一个人如果在思想上落后，按照死记的公式生活，丧失对新鲜事物的感觉，不能正确地分析国内外的形势，他迟早终会被现实生活所抛弃。
    对干部和所有共产党员的马克思—列宁主义的教育问题，应当成为每一个党组织经常注意的中心问题。应当消除组织党的教育工作方面的严重缺点。第十九次党代表大会通过的党章要求每个党的机关必须加强对党员和候补党员的马克思—列宁主义的学习的领导，加强对于劳动人民的共产主义的教育工作。
    在现代的条件下，当我国在实现着由社会主义逐渐过渡到共产主义的时候，思想工作的意义就特别增大了。不克服人们意识中的资本主义残余，就不能建成共产主义。
    在思想战线上，特别需要党组织的高度战斗力和共产党员的政治警惕性。必须对与我们背道而驰的观点、思想和情调的侵蚀展开无情的斗争，这些东西来自国外，来自资本主义国家，也来自国内，来自敌视苏维埃政权的集团的还没有被我们党根除的残余。
    在苏维埃国家中，社会主义思想占着统治的地位，马克思—列宁主义是这种思想的牢不可破的基础。我们党在群众中发扬和培养着高度的社会责任感，以苏维埃爱国主义和各族人民友好的精神、以关心国家利益的精神教育劳动人民。
    在对第十九次代表大会所作的关于党中央委员会的工作总结报告中，规定各级党组织有任务：消灭轻视思想工作的现象，为反对对思想上的错误与歪曲采取自由主义与漠不关心的态度而进行坚决斗争，有步骤地提高和改善我们干部的思想与政治的修养。必须发展社会主义的文化、科学、文学、艺术并使之达到完美的地步，动员一切政治思想教育的工具，我们的宣传、鼓动工作和报刊，来改善共产党员的思想修养，提高工人、农民和知识分子的政治警惕性和政治觉悟。
    第十九次党代表大会的历史性的决议和斯大林同志的天才著作，是我党在争取共产主义胜利的斗争中的强大的思想武器。用代表大会的决议和斯大林同志关于共产主义建设理论的无往而不胜的思想去武装我们的干部和所有共产党员，是每一个党组织的首要任务。提高思想工作的水平，是成功地实现苏联共产党第十九次代表大会所确定的巨大任务的必需条件。
