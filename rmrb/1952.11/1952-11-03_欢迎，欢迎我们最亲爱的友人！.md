    Welcome, welcome our dearest friends!
    By our reporter
    The happy people of Beijing and the Chinese people have just celebrated our own National Day, and now we are welcoming the great 35th anniversary of the October Revolution and "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month" with joy and excitement. Not long ago, we received peace representatives from 37 countries in the Asian and Pacific regions, and now we are even more encouraged by another event: Stalin has sent envoys of friendship! The Soviet delegation of artists and scientists led by Tikhonov has arrived! The Soviet Army Red Flag Song and Dance Ensemble has arrived! We shout: Welcome, welcome our dearest friends!
    On the afternoon of November 2nd, more than 4,000 people from all walks of life in Beijing gathered on the platform and square of the railway station. Splendid flower clusters, colorful banners, and huge slogans were interwoven into a picture of Sino-Soviet friendship. The welcoming masses were waiting for friends from afar. Although Moscow and Beijing are separated by thousands of mountains and rivers, they are linked together in their hearts and in their songs. When the train decorated with "Long Live Sino-Soviet Friendship" arrived, cheers of "Stalin - Mao Zedong" resounded throughout the station. Young Pioneers wearing red scarves and colorful clothes rushed to the Soviet representatives who stepped off the train, and presented dahlias, chrysanthemums, and irises to Tikhonov, Chulaki, Alexandrov, and every dear friend. Soong Ching Ling and Guo Moruo, who were awarded the Stalin International Peace Prize, shook hands with Tikhonov, who won the Stalin Prize three times; the lofty friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people was exchanged through their outstanding representatives. Warm applause rang out in the welcoming ranks. Looking at the faces of the Soviet friends, who seemed to be already familiar, our hearts were filled with a feeling like reuniting with old friends. Welcome, welcome our dearest friends!
    The people of Beijing once welcomed the Soviet delegation of cultural, artistic, and scientific workers headed by Fadeev here. At that time, the new China had just been founded, and the Chinese people stood up from their own land, breaking the past barriers to friendly cooperation between the Chinese and Soviet people. At that time, we shook hands with long-awaited friends with a particularly excited mood. Now, three years have passed, and under the leadership of our great Chairman Mao Zedong, and with the brotherly assistance of the Soviet people, we have led our motherland to a path of infinite happiness and infinite beauty. The powerful Sino-Soviet alliance powerfully defends world peace. As Guo Moruo said at the welcoming meeting: "Today, when the Chinese people are restoring and transforming their national economy and are about to begin large-scale economic construction, it is particularly necessary to learn from the Soviet Union and to further strengthen the friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people." We shouted to the Soviet representatives with gratitude: Welcome, welcome our dearest friends!
    You can say that the welcoming masses here are not limited to the people of Beijing, but are the 475 million people of China. You can imagine: when the news of the arrival of the Soviet delegation in Beijing spread to all parts of the country, to every workshop that is learning advanced Soviet working methods, to the collective farms that are reaping bumper harvests due to the application of Soviet experience, to the orchards where every fruit tree is bearing abundant fruit due to the application of the Michurin theory, to the classrooms of students who are learning Russian, to the site of the Huai River water conservancy project... the people there will also shout: Welcome, welcome our dearest friends!

    欢迎，欢迎我们最亲爱的友人！
    本报记者
    幸福的北京人民和中国人民刚刚度过我们自己的国庆节，现在又以欢欣和兴奋的心情来迎接伟大的十月革命三十五周年和“中苏友好月”。我们在不久以前曾经接待过来自亚洲及太平洋区域三十七个国家的和平代表，现在更为另一件事情所鼓舞：斯大林派来了友谊的使节，以吉洪诺夫为首的苏联艺术科学工作者代表团来到了！苏军红旗歌舞团来到了！我们高呼：欢迎，欢迎我们最亲爱的友人！
    十一月二日下午，北京各界人民四千多人，齐集在车站的月台和广场上。绚丽的花簇，各色的锦旗，巨大的标语，交织成一幅中苏友谊的图画。欢迎的群众在等待着来自远方的友人。莫斯科和北京虽然隔着千山万水，但是在他们的心中，在他们的歌声中，却联在一起了。当有着“中苏友好万岁”彩饰的列车到达时，“斯大林——毛泽东”的欢呼声响彻整个车站。系着红领巾、穿着花衣裳的少年儿童队队员们，拥向步下火车的苏联代表们，把大理花、菊花和鸢尾花献给吉洪诺夫，献给楚拉基，献给亚历山大洛夫，献给每一个亲爱的友人。荣获斯大林国际和平奖金的宋庆龄、郭沫若，和三次荣获斯大林奖金的吉洪诺夫握手了；中苏两国人民的崇高友情通过他们的优秀代表而交流了。欢迎的行列里响起热烈的掌声。我们望着仿佛早已熟识的苏联友人的面孔，心中充满着一种好像旧友重逢的感情。欢迎，欢迎我们最亲爱的友人！
    北京人民曾经在这儿欢迎过以法捷耶夫为首的苏联文化艺术科学工作者代表团。那时候新中国刚刚成立，中国人民从自己的土地上站起来，打破了中苏两国人民友好合作的往昔的壁障。那时候，我们是以一种异样激动的心情来和久所渴望的友人握手。现在三年过去了，我们在伟大的毛泽东主席的领导下，并在苏联人民的兄弟般的援助下，已把我们的祖国引向无限幸福、无限美丽的道路。强大的中苏同盟有力地保卫着世界和平。正如郭沫若在欢迎会上所说：“在中国人民恢复和改造了自己的国民经济、就要开始大规模的经济建设的今天，特别需要学习苏联，特别需要更进一步加强中苏人民的友谊。”我们用感激之情向苏联代表们高呼：欢迎，欢迎我们最亲爱的友人！
    你可以说，在这儿，欢迎的群众并不限于北京的人民，而是全中国四亿七千五百万人民。你可以想像：当苏联代表团到达北京的消息，传到全国各地时，传到正在学习苏联先进工作方法的每个车间、传到由于应用苏联经验而丰收的农庄，传到由于应用米丘林学说而使每棵果树都结得硕果累累的果园，传到正在学习俄文的学生们的课堂，传到淮河水利工程的现场……的时候，那里的人民也将高呼：欢迎，欢迎我们最亲爱的友人！
