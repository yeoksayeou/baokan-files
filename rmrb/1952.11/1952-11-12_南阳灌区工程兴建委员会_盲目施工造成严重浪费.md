    Nanyang Irrigation District Project Construction Committee
    Blind Construction Causes Serious Waste
    Comrade Editor: The Nanyang Irrigation District project has caused significant losses to the state due to blind construction without thorough surveying and design.
    The Nanyang Irrigation District project is located on the Jialu River southwest of Nanyangzhai in the suburbs of Zhengzhou City, Henan Province. The first phase of the project was to complete the canal head works, the main canal earthworks, and the renovation of old canals. The total project cost was estimated at 2 billion yuan. It was planned to be completed and release water on April 1 this year, irrigating 70,000 mu of land in the spring. However, due to blind construction without the necessary surveying and design, not only was the completion date delayed by more than four months, missing the spring irrigation and drought resistance tasks, but also 650 million yuan of funds were wasted. The quality of the project is very poor, with gate plates and dams expanding and contracting, guide walls leaking, and cracks and collapses in the downstream slope protection on the west bank of the dam. As a result, the benefits of the project have been reduced. It was originally intended to irrigate 100,000 mu of land, but according to the current water volume, it can only irrigate 40,000 mu.
    The main reason for this waste is the rough survey work and the hasty engineering design. When selecting the dam foundation, the surveyors did not conduct drilling or listen to the suggestions of the local people, but only decided on the dam site based on the "good" conditions of the high west bank, narrow river channel, and straight river course. This place used to be a large pool, so a lot of effort had to be put into digging mud during construction. It was originally estimated that 550 people would complete the mud work for the foundation of the base groove in five days, but it took 25 days and was still not completed. The entire project was scheduled to be completed on April 1, but it was delayed until August 20. Due to the poor foundation, it was necessary to build a cement base plate, which cost a lot of digging mud and filling stones, and wasted a lot of manpower and materials. According to preliminary statistics, this project alone wasted more than 550 million yuan.
    Another reason for the waste is the poor construction planning and inadequate preparation. The entire project required more than 1,000 wooden piles, but only 20 were prepared in advance. When driving the piles, many long piles were cut into short piles, but later, because the short piles could not be used, the cut short piles were reconnected into long piles. Old dams had stones that were not used, but more than 90,000 cubic feet of stones were purchased separately from Gong County. Small stones were needed, but large stones were purchased, so they had to be broken up. There are many such wasteful phenomena.
    The third reason for the waste is the lack of political leadership. Kong Fanxiu, the director of the Project Construction Committee, was busy with his duties and relaxed leadership. There were also four deputy directors on the committee, but no one knew who was mainly responsible. There was a lack of unity between administrative cadres and technical cadres. When administrative cadres held meetings, technical cadres refused to attend. More seriously, there was a lack of publicity and education for the laborers. Some laborers did not understand the significance of the project and were not active enough in their work, and sometimes absenteeism occurred.
    Although the serious waste caused by the blind construction of the Nanyang Irrigation District project has been jointly inspected and dealt with by the Zhengzhou Prefectural Commissioner's Office Supervision Department, the Zhengzhou Municipal Supervision Committee, and the Zhengzhou Prefectural Commissioner's Office Water Conservancy Promotion Agency, we believe that its lessons still need to be made public, because it has profound educational significance for cadres who lead water conservancy projects and cadres who are specifically responsible for this work in various places.

### 南阳灌区工程兴建委员会  盲目施工造成严重浪费

    南阳灌区工程兴建委员会
    盲目施工造成严重浪费
    编辑同志：南阳灌区工程由于没有进行周密的勘测、设计就盲目施工，使国家遭受了重大的损失。
    南阳灌区工程在河南省郑州市郊区南阳寨西南贾鲁河上。第一期工程是完成渠首工程、干渠土工和旧渠道整理工程。全部工程费用预计为二十亿元。计划在今年四月一日完工放水，在春季即可浇地七万亩。但是由于没有进行应有的勘察、设计即盲目施工，不但把完工日期拖延了四个多月，误了春浇和抗旱任务，并且浪费了六亿五千多万元的资财。工程的质量非常坏，闸板和大坝伸缩，导水墙漏水，大坝西岸下游护坡有裂缝和坍塌现象。这样，工程的效益就降低了。它原定浇地十万亩，根据现在的水量看来，只能浇四万亩。
    造成这种浪费现象的主要原因是调查工作粗糙和工程设计草率。勘测人员在选择坝基时，没有进行钻探，也不听取当地群众的建议，仅根据西岸高、河槽窄、河道直的“良好”条件，决定了坝址。这个地方在过去是个大潭，因此，在施工的时候，要用很大的力量来挖泥。原来预计用五百五十人在五天内完成基槽地基的泥工，结果搞了二十五天还没有完成。全部工程预定在四月一日完工，结果竟拖到八月二十日才完工。由于地基不好，必须打洋灰基盘，耗费了很多挖泥、填石的工夫，浪费了很多的人力物力。据初步统计，仅这项工程中就浪费了五亿五千多万元。
    造成浪费现象的另一原因是施工计划不周到，准备工作太差。整个工程需要一千多根木桩，事先只准备了二十根。打桩的时候，把很多长桩截成短桩，后来因为短桩不能用，又把截断的短桩接成长桩。旧坝有石头不用，却到巩县另买九万多方石头。需要的是小石头，买来的却是大石头，只得把它打碎了。像这样的浪费现象是很多的。
    造成浪费现象的第三个原因是缺乏政治领导。工程兴建委员会主任孔繁秀职务繁忙，放松领导，委员会还有四个副主任，但是谁也不知道谁是主要负责人。行政干部和技术干部间不团结，行政干部召开会议，技术干部竟拒不参加。更严重的是对民工缺乏宣传教育，有些民工还不明白这个工程的重大意义，工作不够积极，有时发生旷工的现象。
    南阳灌区工程因盲目施工造成的严重浪费的事件，虽然经过了郑州专员公署监察处、郑州市监察委员会、郑州专员公署水利推进社三个机构会同检查处理，但我们认为它的教训还有加以公布的必要，因为它对各地领导水利工程的干部和具体负责这一工作的干部，都有深刻的教育意义。
