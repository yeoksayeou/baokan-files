    With the Help of Soviet Experts, I Developed a Loading Method
    Editor: In 1950, with the sincere help of Soviet experts, I created an advanced working method and was promoted from an ordinary weigher to a cargo supervisor.
    In 1950, I was a cargo weigher at the Harbin Station of the China Changchun Railway. At that time, I was not familiar with the business, my work was disorganized, and accidents often occurred. Comrade Radavsky, the chief of the Business Section of the Harbin Railway Sub-bureau (now the director of the Business Department of the China Changchun Railway Administration), often came to our group to understand the work situation, point out the shortcomings in our group's work, and help us improve. Once, he noticed that the porcelain bowls our group was loading were not well packaged, and there was not enough padding in the bowls. He patiently said to me: When loading fragile goods, they must be packaged very well, otherwise they will be easily damaged during transportation. Later, he told us how to improve the packaging of goods so that we could load more goods. He said: When loading machines, we must mobilize the cargo owners to disassemble the parts as much as possible and tie them together, so that the space occupied by the goods can be reduced. He also told us that when loading, we must also match the goods according to their different shapes. When loading large jars, put small jars inside, so that more jars can be loaded on the car. We loaded the goods according to the methods he taught us, and gradually increased the loading capacity. With the help of Comrade Radavsky, I finally created an advanced loading method and achieved great results in my work. The goods that used to require 600 cars per month to load can now be loaded with only 250 cars per month. In the past, it took three hours to load each car, but now it takes one hour.
    This year, with the help of Soviet expert Comrade Shaklagov, and based on the principle of Mamedov's car delivery and retrieval method, I created a numbered car delivery and retrieval method, which developed the original loading method and achieved great results. In the past, due to the improper location of the distribution vehicles, loading and unloading workers had to use handcarts, pushing an average of eight kilometers per month. Since the implementation of the numbered car delivery and retrieval method, this is no longer necessary, thus shortening the dwell time.
    In the future, I am determined to intensify my study of advanced Soviet experience and firmly remember what the Soviet experts told me: "Do not be arrogant, study modestly, and consolidate and improve existing achievements."

### 在苏联专家帮助下，我发展了装车法

    在苏联专家帮助下，我发展了装车法
    编辑同志：一九五○年在苏联专家真诚的帮助下，我创造了先进工作方法，由一个普通的司磅员提升为货物主任。
    一九五○年，我是中长铁路哈尔滨车站的货物司磅员，那时，我对业务不够熟悉，工作无头绪，常常出事故，哈尔滨铁路分局商务科科长（现任中长铁路管理局商务处长）拉达夫斯基同志，就时常到我们小组来了解工作情况，指出我们小组在工作中的缺点，并帮助我们加以改进。有一次他发觉我们小组要装上车的磁碗，包装得不好，碗里的垫草也不多。他就耐心地对我说：装容易破损的货物时，必须包装得很好，不然在运行中容易损坏。后来他又告诉我们怎样改善包装货物的办法，以便能多装货物。他说：装机器时，要动员货主尽可能地把零件都拆卸下来捆在一起，这样就能缩小货物占用的空间。他又告诉我们，装车时，还要根据货物不同的形状，进行配装，装大缸时套上小缸，就可在车上多装缸。我们就按照他所教给的方法装货，逐步地提高了装载量。在拉达夫斯基同志帮助下，我终于创造了先进的装车法，在工作中获得了很大成绩。去年每月用六百辆车才能装好的货物，现在每月只用二百五十辆车就行了。过去每车装货时间为三小时，现在是一小时。
    今年我在苏联专家沙克拉果夫同志的帮助下，根据马梅多夫取送车法的原理，又创造了对号取送车法，发展了原来的装车法，得到很大成效。过去由于配送车辆位置不适当，装卸工人要用手推车，每月平均要推八公里。自实行对号取送车法后，就根本不要这样了，因而缩短了停留时间。
    今后我决心加紧学习苏联先进经验，并且牢牢记住苏联专家告诉我的话：“不骄不傲，虚心学习，将现有成绩加以巩固和提高。”
