    Suggest大力除治Pine caterpillar during the winter slack season
    Editor: The *Masson pine* in southern China, the *Pinus tabuliformis* in northern China, and the *Larix gmelinii* in Northeast China are suffering severely from pine caterpillars. Last year, pine caterpillar outbreaks occurred in Zhejiang, Anhui, Shandong, Hubei, Jiangxi, Hebei, and Liaodong provinces. The affected area reached more than 120,000 mu. This year, the affected areas are even larger than last year. According to incomplete statistics, the area of mountain forests affected nationwide is more than 320,000 mu. The affected pine trees are generally around 20 years old and young trees. Pine trees can continue to grow leaves after being damaged once, but if they are damaged twice in a year, they may die.
    Pine caterpillars occur during the busy farming season from May to August, and mobilizing the masses to catch them will delay production. In winter, the pine caterpillars in the north have the habit of going down the trees to overwinter, and although the pine caterpillars in the south do not go down the trees, their activity is also reduced, which makes it easier to catch them. Therefore, I suggest that in the winter slack season, all areas with this pest should vigorously mobilize the masses to eliminate and control them.

    建议各地利用冬闲期间大力除治松毛虫
    编辑同志：我国南方的马尾松、北方的油松和东北的落叶松，受松毛虫的为害非常严重。去年浙江、安徽、山东、湖北、江西、河北、辽东等省都发生了松毛虫。被害的面积达十二万余亩。今年被害的地区比去年还大，据不完全的统计，全国被害的山林面积有三十二万余亩。被害的松树一般都是二十年生左右的松树和幼树。松树被害一次，还可以继续生叶，如在一年中被害两次，就可能枯死。
    松毛虫发生在五月到八月的农忙时期，如果发动群众捕打，就会耽误生产。在冬季，北方的松毛虫有下树越冬的习惯，南方的松毛虫虽不下树，但活动能力也小了，这就便于捕打了。因此，我建议在冬季农闲时期，凡有这种害虫的地区，应大力发动群众进行除治。
