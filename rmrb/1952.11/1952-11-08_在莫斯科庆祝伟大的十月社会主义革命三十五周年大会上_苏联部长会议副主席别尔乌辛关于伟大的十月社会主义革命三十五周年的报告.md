    At the Meeting in Moscow Celebrating the Thirty-Fifth Anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution
    Report by P.N. Pospelov, Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR, on the Thirty-Fifth Anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution

    Comrades:
    Thirty-five years have passed since the victory of the Great October Socialist Revolution in our country under the brilliant leadership of the most outstanding leaders of the proletariat, Lenin and Stalin. This event of world historical significance determined the fundamental change in the entire development of modern society. The era of capitalism's dominance in the world came to an end, and the era of proletarian revolution and socialist victory began.
    The people of all nationalities of the Soviet Union are celebrating the thirty-fifth anniversary of the founding of the Soviet state amidst a new surge of political and labor enthusiasm inspired by the historically significant resolutions of the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.
    The 19th Party Congress vividly demonstrated to the world the unprecedented achievements made by the Soviet people under the leadership of their Communist Party in such a historically short period. The Soviet people have cast off the shackles of capital, established the first socialist society in human history, and have already entered the period of gradual transition from socialism to communism. The Soviet Union has become a solid fortress of peace, progress, and democracy.
    The 19th Party Congress will become a most important milestone in the history of the struggle of the Soviet people on the great road of our communist construction. The resolutions of the Congress are a concrete embodiment of the victory of Marxist-Leninist theory, and the new classic work of our teacher and leader, Comrade Stalin, published on the eve of the Congress, has further enriched the theory of Marxism-Leninism.
    In "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR," Comrade Stalin profoundly analyzed the results of our struggle and victory, as well as the fundamental problems of our time, and clearly defined the plan for our further development. This new Marxist work of our great leader and teacher is of very significant international importance, it ideologically arms the world communist movement and raises it to a new level. It discovered the driving force behind the epoch-making victories achieved by the Soviet people, and pointed out to the working people of all countries how we have put our economy on the socialist track, how we have established the friendship between the working class and the peasants, and how we have turned our country into a prosperous and powerful nation.
    Comrade Stalin tells us that the October Revolution was able to triumph and our socialist society was able to be built because we had such a social force as the worker-peasant alliance, which shattered the resistance of the decadent forces of capitalist society and gave free rein to the objectively functioning economic law that production relations must conform to the nature of productive forces.
    In accordance with this objective economic law, the Soviet government has socialized the means of production, turned them into the property of the whole people, thereby abolishing the system of exploitation and establishing socialist economic forms.
    Due to the implementation of the policy of national socialist industrialization and agricultural collectivization, our country advanced by leaps and bounds during the pre-war Stalin Five-Year Plans, transforming from a technically and economically backward agricultural country into an advanced, socialist industrial power.
    The facts of the past thirty-five years have constantly demonstrated and confirmed the invincible vitality of the Soviet social and state system. Our country not only gloriously withstood the severe test of the Great Patriotic War, but also eliminated the Hitlerite army and saved the world from the threat of fascist enslavement. After the war, the Soviet people rapidly restored their war-damaged industry, transportation, and agriculture, and then greatly exceeded pre-war levels in the output of all sectors of the national economy.
    The Soviet people welcomed with great enthusiasm the communist construction plan adopted by the 19th Party Congress. They firmly believe that this magnificent plan will surely be realized.
    Every day we advance victoriously along the road to communism, our progress constantly increases the strength and international prestige of the democratic and socialist camp, and inspires the working people of all countries to carry out revolutionary struggles against imperialism.
    In these days, the eyes of hundreds of millions of people in all countries are turned to the Soviet Union, which stands like a huge lighthouse in the world, pointing out the road to a brighter future for mankind. Progressive men and women and the powerful democratic and socialist camp around the world are celebrating the thirty-fifth anniversary of the October Socialist Revolution with us.

    (I) The Domestic Situation in the Soviet Union

    In 1952, the Soviet people achieved new successes in all sectors of the socialist economy and culture.
    According to the requirements of the basic economic law of socialism discovered by Comrade Stalin, the Communist Party and the Soviet government are developing our country's economy in the direction of continuously expanding all sectors of the economy and ensuring a continuous increase in the people's living standards. This is vividly demonstrated by the directives of the 19th Party Congress on the Five-Year Plan for the Development of the Soviet Union.
    With the completion of this new Five-Year Plan, the historically significant program for developing the national economy proposed by Comrade Stalin in his speech to the voters on February 9, 1946, to be completed in the three five-year periods thereafter, will certainly be completed within the prescribed time, and the petroleum production plan may even be completed before the prescribed time, that is, during the current five-year plan period.
    In order to complete the Stalin Fifth Five-Year Plan as soon as possible, a socialist emulation movement has now been launched across the country.
    In this emulation movement, thousands upon thousands of new, talented model workers are emerging; this movement is discovering the great potential for further increasing labor productivity; this movement is developing various new forms of emulation. The high-speed smelting method is being applied on an unprecedentedly wide scale in the metallurgical industry. In the coal mining industry, the workfaces and longwalls are adopting the cyclical operation method, and coal mining combines and stone loading machines are being widely used. In the petroleum industry, the high-speed deep-well drilling method is being increasingly widely used. In the machine manufacturing industry, the high-speed metal cutting method is being increasingly widely adopted. In the chemical industry, continuous and highly efficient operation methods are being increasingly widely adopted.
    The application of new technologies and advanced labor organization methods, the improvement of workers' skills, and the continuous mechanization of labor-intensive operations have ensured the continuous improvement of labor productivity in all sectors of the national economy. Labor productivity in the industrial sector will be 17 percent higher in 1952 than in 1950, and will increase by about 50 percent by 1955.
    Comrade Stalin said that in the Soviet Union, various machines save social labor and lighten the labor of workers.
    As a result of the mechanization of labor-intensive processes and the automatic management of production processes, the labor of workers in industry, transportation, and agriculture has been greatly reduced. Industries such as coal dragging workers and manual coal mining workers in the coal mining industry, steel rolling workers in the steel industry, and pump management workers in the petroleum industry, which until recently required many people, no longer exist. Conversely, new industries have emerged, such as coal mining combine operators, oil refining mechanics, turbine drilling machine operators, chainsaw workers in the logging industry, and boiler mechanics in power stations.
    A large proportion of the workers who have acquired these new specialized skills have received secondary education and have considerable technical knowledge. They are living examples of how the fundamental opposition between intellectual labor and physical labor is gradually disappearing.
    An important indicator of the development of socialist industry is the reduction of production costs. The savings from lowering production costs last year, which made it possible to reduce prices, totaled 35.5 billion rubles, and will exceed 46 billion rubles in 1952.
    In the first ten months of 1952, the entire industrial production plan was completed at more than 101 percent. The average annual rate of increase in total industrial output in 1951 and 1952 will be more than 14 percent, while the Five-Year Plan stipulates an increase of 12 percent.
    The foundation for the development of all sectors of the national economy is heavy industry.
    The directives of the Five-Year Plan stipulate that the average annual rate of increase in the output of means of production should be 13 percent. In reality, in the first two years of the new Five-Year Plan, this average rate will reach 15 percent. The output of our large-scale industry in nine days is now equal to the output of Russia in one year before the Great October Socialist Revolution.
    All sectors of the Soviet steel industry have completed their plans for the first ten months of 1952: iron—103 percent; steel—101 percent; rolled metal—102 percent. The steel produced in the first two years of the Fifth Five-Year Plan will be 2.4 times the steel produced in the first two years of the Fourth Five-Year Plan.
    The coal production plan for the first ten months of this year has been completed at 101 percent. The coal produced this year will be 15 percent more than in 1950. It is interesting to compare the development of the Soviet coal industry with that of Britain. In 1913, Russia produced only one-tenth of the coal produced by Britain, while in 1951, the Soviet Union produced 25 percent more coal than Britain. During this period, Britain's coal production fell by 23 percent, while the Soviet Union's increased nearly tenfold.
    The Soviet oil industry is developing rapidly. The production plan for the first ten months of 1952 was completed at 101 percent. Compared with 1950, oil production increased by 24 percent. The oil refining plan, the production plan for gasoline, lubricating oil, and other products have also been overfulfilled.
    The chemical industry, non-ferrous metal industry, and building materials industry have all completed their plans for the first ten months of 1952.
    Technological progress and the rapid development of all sectors of the national economy depend on the continuous expansion of our machine manufacturing industry. The total output of the machine manufacturing industry this year will be more than 40 percent higher than the total output in 1950. The fastest development is in the manufacture of equipment for the power industry, metallurgical industry, and oil industry.
    We all know that in terms of electrification, the Five-Year Plan stipulates a rapid increase in the generating capacity and electricity production of power stations, so that the development of electrification can keep up with the rapidly developing national economy. Lenin brilliantly explained the importance of electrification in building a communist society in his famous formula: "Communism is Soviet power plus the electrification of the whole country." For thirty-five years, the Soviet people have achieved remarkable achievements in electrifying the country. For the past several years, the average annual increase in generating capacity in the Soviet Union has been twice the increase in generating capacity during the ten years of implementing the "State Commission for Electrification of Russia" plan.
    This year's electricity production will be 29 percent more than in 1950.
    The electricity produced by Soviet power stations in just one month is now equivalent to the electricity produced by pre-revolutionary Russia in five years.
    The production of consumer goods has also increased greatly this year. The New Five-Year Plan instructions originally stipulated an average annual increase of 11 percent in the output of consumer goods, but in the first two years of the New Five-Year Plan, the average annual increase was more than 13 percent.
    Light industry and the food industry are expanding every year, and the production of consumer goods and food is increasing. In the first two years of the Fifth Five-Year Plan, the output of the food industry increased by more than 25 percent, and the quality and variety of products have been improved.
    The people will get more manufactured goods and food this year than in 1950: clothing—increased by 27 percent; leather shoes—increased by 32 percent; meat and fish—increased by 31 percent; butter, vegetable oil and other edible fats—increased by 31 percent; sugar—increased by 58 percent; confectionery—increased by 29 percent. Household appliances such as refrigerators, washing machines, vacuum cleaners, etc., have also increased. However, while our socialist industry has made great achievements this year, we should not ignore the serious shortcomings that still exist in the work of some industrial sectors and individual factories.
    The work of some industrial sectors is not satisfactory, and they have not completed the plans for increasing production and reducing costs.
    There are also some factories that have not produced all the products stipulated, and the quality of the products produced is not high, and they do not comply with the standards and technical conditions prescribed by the government.
    The heads of those factories and industrial sectors that have not completed the state plan or produced low-quality products, it is best to remind them that if they do not correct their mistakes, they will have to leave, and let those who are more capable and familiar with the business take over.
    Agriculture has made rapid progress in the past two years. The cultivated area has been expanded, especially the most valuable food crop—wheat.
    Everyone knows that this year's total grain harvest reached 8 billion poods, and the wheat harvest increased by 48 percent compared with 1940. Therefore, the grain problem, which has always been considered our most serious problem, has now been solved victoriously, definitely, and finally. The harvest of cotton, sugar beet, flax, sunflower, and potatoes has also increased compared with last year.
    New achievements have also been made in livestock breeding. During the period from July 1950 to July 1952, the total number of various livestock on various farms increased by 26.7 million head.
    In the entire Soviet Union, the total output and commodity output of livestock products have exceeded pre-war levels.
    The technological basis of agriculture has been further strengthened by the acquisition of a large number of new tractors, trucks, and agricultural machines, so the degree of mechanization of the main farming processes is now greater. In 1952, three-quarters of the main field work on collective farms was completed by tractors and machines from machine tractor stations. The planting of cotton, sugar beet, and other industrial crops is now practically 100 percent mechanized. More than 70 percent of the grain planting area on collective farms is harvested by combine harvesters. The amount of cotton picked and ginned by machines is increasing year by year.
    Farmers in the steppe and forest-steppe regions of the European part of the Soviet Union are victoriously implementing Stalin's plan for planting shelterbelts. In the past two years alone, the area afforested in these regions has been nearly 1.5 million hectares.
    The 19th Congress of our Party has put forward new great tasks for agriculture to further increase crop yields and develop livestock breeding.
    In order to successfully complete these tasks, it is first necessary to eliminate the shortcomings existing in the work of collective farms, state farms, and machine tractor stations. It is necessary to improve the quality of field work, shorten the time of field work; use tractors and other agricultural machines more effectively, and increase the organizational role of machine tractor stations in enabling collective farms to complete crop production and total grain harvest plans.
    The men and women farmers of the collective farms and all agricultural workers have guaranteed that they will work hard to complete the Second Stalin Post-War Five-Year Plan. Therefore, there is no doubt that the agricultural goals stipulated in the new Five-Year Plan will definitely be achieved.
    Like our industry and agriculture, our railway and waterway transportation systems are also developing steadily. This year, our railway freight volume will increase by 23 percent compared with 1950, inland river freight volume will increase by 21 percent, and sea freight volume will increase by 22 percent. The electrification of our railways is expanding greatly. New sea ships and inland river steamers are being added.
    This year, the V.I. Lenin (Volga-Don) Canal—one of the great construction projects of the Stalin era—began to navigate.
    The basic purpose of socialist production is to maximize the satisfaction of the ever-growing material and cultural needs of society. The living and cultural standards of the Soviet people are constantly improving. The quantity of consumer goods available for sale is increasing day by day. In 1952, the sales volume of state and cooperative retail trade increased by 27 percent compared with 1950.
    In April this year, the state prices of food and manufactured goods were reduced for the fifth time after the war. This means that real wages and salaries have further increased, and farmers can spend less money on buying manufactured goods.
    In order to continue to improve the living conditions of the working people, our housing construction plan is expanding year by year.
    In 1951 and the first ten months of 1952, the living area of ​​new houses built in cities and workers' residential areas reached 43 million square meters. This is equivalent to more than 1 million two-room bungalows. 620,000 houses have been built in rural areas.
    The number of houses built in our capital Moscow in 1952 will be close to twice the pre-war number in 1940. The first batch of tall buildings has been completed, and they are all magnificent high-rise buildings. The increase in national income is an objective indicator of the increasing prosperity of the lives of our working people. This year, the national income of the Soviet Union will increase by 25 percent compared with 1950. Due to the increase in national income, it is possible to greatly increase the income of the people and increase investment in the national economy.
    The current Five-Year Plan stipulates that investment in industry should be increased to about twice that of the Fourth Five-Year Plan. Many factories, mines, power stations, and railways will be built or expanded. In 1952, the state basic construction project was 26 percent larger than in 1950.
    The huge Stalin projects on the Volga River, Dnieper River, Don River, and Amu Darya River occupy a special place. In 1952, the construction work of these projects will be doubled compared with 1951. This work is proceeding smoothly according to plan.
    In the past few years, we have been transitioning on a large scale from the mechanization of individual construction processes to comprehensive mechanization, and high-speed, new-style construction methods are being widely used.
    Due to the use of new-style machines, more effective work organization, and the improvement of the cultural and technical level of builders, labor productivity in the construction industry will increase by 20 percent in 1952 compared with 1950.
    However, there are still serious shortcomings in the work of construction organizations. The main shortcomings are the failure to complete construction projects according to the prescribed schedule and the failure to reduce construction costs according to the plan. Resolute measures must be taken to eliminate these shortcomings.
    In the past few years, the Soviet people have also made great achievements in science, culture, and art.
    While implementing the seven-year universal education system, secondary (ten-year) education is expanding. This enables us to implement universal secondary education (ten-year system) in the capitals and major cities of various republics, in various states and border regions, and in other important industrial centers before the end of this five-year plan period. We must prepare to implement universal secondary education in all other cities and villages during the next five-year period. At the same time, we must also make full preparations for the implementation of universal technical education.
    This year, there are far more students attending universities, colleges, and secondary vocational schools than in previous years. The number of universities and college students in the Soviet Union is more than one and a half times the number of universities and college students in all capitalist countries in Europe combined. The number of young experts graduating in the first two years of the Fifth Five-Year Plan is 65 percent more than the number graduating in the first two years of the Fourth Five-Year Plan. Due to the constant concern of the Communist Party and the Soviet government, the number of primary schools, secondary schools, secondary vocational schools, colleges, and universities in our country is increasing year by year.
    The new magnificent building of the State Moscow University, built according to the initiative of Comrade Stalin, is about to be completed.
    The Party and the government are very concerned about the health of the Soviet people. This year, the expenditure on public health will reach 27.7 billion rubles. More hospitals, clinics, sanatoriums, and health resorts are under construction. The production of medicines and medical equipment has increased greatly this year. In the past few years, due to the continuous improvement of medical care and the increasing prosperity of the people's lives, the birth rate in our country has increased, and the disease and mortality rates have been greatly reduced.
    The Soviet people have made high-speed progress in science and technology. A convincing proof of this is the success in the design and construction of hydraulic engineering projects of unprecedented scale and complexity, the establishment of high-rise buildings, and the design and production of extremely complex machines and equipment. One of the reasons for this progress is that the experience of advanced workers in our industry and agriculture constantly enriches science.
    Now, there is no machine, instrument, apparatus, or technical process that Soviet experts and workers cannot design. In the past few years, the various institutes of the Soviet Academy of Sciences have been greatly expanded, and new experimental buildings with superior equipment have been established. Soviet industry supplies scientists with extremely precise measuring instruments and state-of-the-art experimental equipment.
    All of this has enriched the theoretical knowledge of various scientific departments, especially the theoretical knowledge in using atomic energy to benefit mankind.
    In the past thirty-five years, the people of all nationalities of the multi-ethnic Soviet Union have undergone tremendous changes in economy and culture. The great October Socialist Revolution liberated all nationalities from political, national, and economic oppression. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, the economically and culturally backward ethnic regions have developed into socialist republics with thriving industry and collective farms.
    The original bourgeois nationalities are no longer there; replaced by new advanced socialist nationalities, they have developed and grown stronger.
    The Lenin-Stalin national policy guarantees the development of science, culture, and art of all nationalities of the Soviet Union. Their schools, colleges, universities, scientific research institutes, clubs, libraries, and theaters are increasing day by day. Various federated republics have their own academies of sciences. They have trained a large number of experts in industry and agriculture of their own nationalities and their own intellectuals.
    The further development of the economy and culture of the various federated republics stipulated in the New Five-Year Plan will help strengthen the friendly relations between the people of all nationalities of the Soviet Union and the strength of our Soviet state.
    While our people are carrying out their peaceful socialist construction plan, they have never forgotten the warnings of Lenin and Stalin, the founders of the Soviet state: it is necessary to consolidate the national defense of the socialist state, vigorously strengthen the Soviet army and navy, and keep them in combat readiness. The Soviet armed forces obtain the latest weapons and military equipment from socialist industry.
    However, the strength of our army is not only due to its first-class equipment, but also due to its unparalleled political qualities, the patriotism of its combatants and commanders, and its unbreakable ties with the people surrounding it with love and concern. All commanders and fighters of the Soviet Army and Navy know that their mission is to defend their socialist motherland and protect the peaceful labor of the Soviet people—they are proud of this. History has proven that such an army is invincible!
    If the American warmongers and their lackeys forget the strength of the Soviet army, forget that it is ready to give a fatal counterattack at any time to all aggressors who dare to invade the borders of our great motherland, they are wrong.
    Comrades, the achievements we have made in all aspects of socialist construction are tremendous. However, complacency and arrogance are incompatible with the Soviet people cultivated by the party of Lenin and Stalin, who believe that the achievements already made are a favorable basis for obtaining new achievements.
    The 19th Party Congress emphasized the importance of boldly launching criticism and self-criticism of the shortcomings in our work.
    The Soviet people will fulfill this historically significant exhortation of our Party Congress, and eliminate the shortcomings in all aspects of the communist construction work with the greatest determination, thereby completing and overfulfilling the great Fifth Five-Year Plan!

    (II) The Soviet Union's Foreign Policy and Promotion of World Peace

    The Soviet people are dedicated to heroic labor, paving the way for the working people of the whole world to a better future.
    The past thirty-five years have fully confirmed the remarks made by Lenin and Stalin on the world historical tasks and significance of the Great October Socialist Revolution. Our great leaders have repeatedly pointed out that the international significance of the October Revolution is not only manifested in the "broad" sense that it affects all countries, but also in the "narrow" sense that its main characteristics and laws of development are reproduced worldwide.
    The great Lenin said: "Our road is the correct road, because other countries will inevitably take this road sooner or later." This prediction is being realized.
    Due to the heroic victory of the Soviet people in World War II, countries with a total population of more than 600 million have broken away from the capitalist system and formed a powerful democratic and socialist camp with the Soviet Union.
    In 1952, the people's democratic countries also made further progress in economic and cultural aspects.
    Compared with 1951, the industrial output of Czechoslovakia, Poland, Romania, Hungary, and Bulgaria increased by 22 to 25 percent this year, and the industrial output of Albania increased by more than 80 percent. The total output of large and medium-sized industries will be several times higher than before the war.
    The people's democratic countries are electrifying at high speed. Compared with 1950, the power generation of Poland and Czechoslovakia increased by 24 or 25 percent in 1952, Hungary and Romania increased by 38 percent, Bulgaria increased by 77 percent, Albania increased to more than three times, and the German Democratic Republic increased by 22 percent. One of the forms of friendship and cooperation between these countries is that the electricity of one country is successfully transmitted to another country—from Romania to Bulgaria, from Poland to Czechoslovakia, and the exchange of electricity between the German Democratic Republic and Poland.
    The reason why the economies of the people's democratic countries can develop rapidly is largely due to the extensive brotherly assistance given to them by the Soviet Union. In the European people's democratic countries and the People's Republic of China, many new factories and power stations have been put into operation, which are built according to the designs of Soviet experts and equipped with machines manufactured by Soviet factories.
    With the help of the Soviet Union, the people's democratic countries are effectively developing and transforming their agriculture. An important tool in this transformation is the machine tractor stations owned by the government, which have been established in all people's democratic countries. The movement of working farmers in various people's democratic countries to participate in cooperatives and organize agricultural production cooperatives is expanding.
    In all the European people's democratic countries, along with the overall economic development, the living standards of the working people have been rapidly improving.
    The People's Republic of China has also made great progress since its people, under the leadership of the Communist Party, ended the rule of the imperialists and their lackeys, the Kuomintang bandits, and seized power in their own hands.
    In 1951, industrial output was more than double that of 1949. By the end of 1951, the output of several industrial sectors had reached, and some products even exceeded, the highest pre-war level.
    The great land reform, which has been almost entirely completed in China, has produced good results in agriculture. The People's Republic of China now plants enough grain and cotton to meet the needs of the people, and can even export agricultural products to other countries.
    The economic development of all the people's democratic countries convincingly proves that the economic blockade policy implemented by the American imperialists against the democratic and socialist camp has completely failed. Those who implement this blockade policy have reaped what they sowed. As for the countries of the democratic and socialist camp, they have become more closely united, established economic cooperation and mutual assistance, and opened up their own world market in opposition to the capitalist world market, thereby retaliating against the blockade policy.
    Comrade Stalin said: "The most important result of World War II and its economic impact in economic terms is that the collapse of the unified and all-encompassing world market must be considered, which determines the further deepening of the general crisis of the world capitalist system."
    In Comrade Malenkov's report of the Central Committee of the Communist Party at the 19th Party Congress, he made a profound Marxist analysis of the current overall international situation, and cited facts and figures to convincingly illustrate that, on the one hand, the strength of the democratic and socialist camp is growing, and on the other hand, the general crisis of world capitalism is deepening. The current overall world economic situation is characterized by two development lines.
    "One line is the continuous development of the peaceful economy of the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, which does not encounter crises, and its purpose is to maximize the satisfaction of the material and cultural needs of society...
    The other line is the capitalist economy with stagnant productivity. This economy is trapped in the increasingly deepening general crisis of capitalism and the frequently recurring economic crises. This is the line of economic militarization and the one-sided development of military production sectors; this is the line of mutual competition between many countries and the enslavement of some countries by others."
    The contradictions between the United States and Britain, the United States and France, and other European capitalist countries are becoming increasingly acute. American monopoly capitalists and British monopoly capitalists are openly fighting for the production areas of oil, rubber, non-ferrous metals, and sulfur, as well as the market for selling goods. West German capitalists and French capitalists have contradictions on the issue of the so-called European Coal and Steel Community, so a sharp conflict between West Germany and France is maturing. Their contradictions on the Saar issue are also becoming increasingly acute.
    In order to try to get rid of the general crisis of capitalism, which became more obvious after World War II, the American imperialists are preparing to launch another world war. Their goal is to establish their hegemony in the world. But the frantic arms expansion movement carried out by the imperialist camp under American pressure has increasingly deepened the difficulties and contradictions that are causing this camp to disintegrate and will inevitably lead to an economic crisis.
    The production of capitalist countries has been stagnant for some time. If we take the figures for the first quarter of 1951 as 100, then the index of industrial production in the United States for each quarter will be as follows:
    First quarter of 1951    100
    Second quarter    103
    Third quarter    101
    Fourth quarter    101
    1952    First quarter    100
    Second quarter    97
    From these figures, we can see that the index of industrial production reached its peak in the second quarter of 1951 and then began to decline. In the first quarter of this year, the index of industrial production was at the same level as in the first quarter of last year, and then further declined. Despite the fact that the arms expansion movement is in full swing, the level of overall industrial production is declining. The reason is obvious. Civilian industry has been cut so severely that even the full expansion of the war industry cannot offset the amount cut. Therefore, the consequences of the distorted development of the American economy have been manifested very sharply.
    The European capitalist countries, which have adopted the policy of arms expansion, are also cutting civilian production, thereby causing industrial stagnation.
    The war economy is consuming a large amount of resources. For several years, the US budget has been a typical war budget. For example, in the budget for the 1952-53 fiscal year, direct military expenditures accounted for 74 percent, which is more than twice the military expenditures before the outbreak of the Korean War.
    In the 1949-50 fiscal year, the military expenditures of the Western European members of the Atlantic Group totaled 6.2 billion US dollars. In the budget for the 1952-53 fiscal year, at the request of the American rulers, this military expenditure will increase to about 16 billion US dollars.
    The arms expansion movement is a source of unprecedentedly huge profits for billionaires and millionaires. In the seven years after the war, the profits obtained by American monopoly capitalists totaled about 220 billion US dollars. On the other hand, the taxes levied on ordinary people are increasing at an unprecedented rate. Newspapers say that the taxes collected by Truman during his term as president are more than the total of the taxes collected by the thirty-one American presidents before him.
    In all countries of the aggression camp, the inflation, which was already serious enough, has become more serious due to the arms expansion movement. The market is flooded with paper money. The purchasing power of money is declining regularly, while the prices of consumer goods are constantly rising. The living standards are declining rapidly. The living conditions of the working masses are deteriorating. In the United States, Japan, Britain, Italy, Belgium, and West Germany alone, the total number of fully unemployed and partially unemployed people is 32 million. The wave of workers' strikes and political demonstrations is rising.
    Bourgeois economists are no longer arguing about whether another economic crisis will occur, but are arguing about when it will occur. It is significant that various economic research institutions are openly warning the business community to "prepare for" the inevitable and imminent crisis.
    At the same time, in order to divert the workers' attention from their miserable living conditions, the huge propaganda machine of the American billionaires is artificially inciting war terror. It is making people accustomed to the so-called inevitability of using atomic bombs; it is day after day not only intimidating adults, but also intimidating children, especially by creating fake air raid alarms. The consequences are obvious. Many Americans have lost their peace of mind. They are constantly watching the sky, and some people even imagine that they see strange things, and they say that these things seem to be huge "flying saucers," "flying discs," "flying pots," or "green fireballs." American newspapers and magazines often publish the narrative of "an eyewitness" who saw these strange things, and asserted that even if they are not some secret projector of Russia, they are at least flying machines sent by someone from another planet to see what is happening in the United States! How much this reminds us of the Russian proverb "Suspicion breeds ghosts"!
    In his historic speech to the 19th Party Congress, Comrade Stalin said that in capitalist countries, the principles of equality of human rights and equality of nationalities have been trampled on, and these principles have been replaced by the principle that the minority who engage in exploitation enjoy full rights, while the exploited majority of citizens have no rights. Now, only those who have capital are recognized to have personal rights, while all other citizens are treated as human raw materials only suitable for exploitation. The American rulers have openly embarked on the path of fascism. They are following in Hitler's footsteps. They have established a reign of terror in the country, they are trying to suppress all progressive forces, they have almost declared the Communist Party illegal, and with the help of the thugs they employ, they are dispersing assemblies arranged by democratic organizations. The propaganda and preparation work for launching another imperialist war to seize world hegemony has reached an unprecedented scale.
    Since the American rulers are ready to launch another world war, they are establishing a network of military bases in Europe, Asia, and the Near and Middle East, and stationing armed forces in these areas. They are single-mindedly sabotaging international cooperation. The American imperialists are single-mindedly hoping to revive German militarism, so they are doing their best to preserve the division of Germany and turn West Germany into an American military base. For this purpose, they are forcing the approval of the Bonn Agreement and the Paris Treaty to establish the so-called European Defense Group. In Asia, they are frantically reviving Japanese militarism. It is precisely for this purpose that they forced Japan to accept a separate peace treaty, which is a military treaty aimed at turning Japan into an American military base as well.
    Two and a half years ago, the American imperialists launched a bloody war against the heroic Korean people.
    The United States has become the base camp of reactionary forces and fascists around the world, and has become the center of the world-scale conspiracy of aggressors to undermine international peace and security.
    No wonder ordinary people everywhere hate the American army so much, because they are trampling on the rights and freedoms of people of all countries with their jackboots.
    But the American warmongers have no power to reverse the wheels of history. The struggle of the people

    在莫斯科庆祝伟大的十月社会主义革命三十五周年大会上
    苏联部长会议副主席别尔乌辛关于伟大的十月社会主义革命三十五周年的报告同志们：
    自从伟大的十月社会主义革命在无产阶级最杰出的领袖列宁和斯大林底天才领导下在我国取得胜利以来，三十五年已经过去了。这个具有世界历史意义的事件决定了整个现代社会发展中的根本变化。资本主义独霸世界的时代告终，无产阶级革命和社会主义胜利的时代开始了。
    苏联各族人民在苏联共产党第十九次代表大会具有历史意义的决议所鼓舞起来的政治和劳动热情的新的高涨中，庆祝苏维埃国家建国三十五周年。
    第十九次党代表大会向世界生动地说明了：苏联人民在他们的共产党的领导下在历史上如此短促的一个时期中获得了空前的成就。苏联人民摆脱了资本的枷锁，建立了人类历史上的第一个社会主义社会，并且已经进入从社会主义逐渐过渡到共产主义的时期。苏联已成为和平、进步与民主的坚固堡垒。
    第十九次党代表大会在苏联人民的斗争史上将成为我国共产主义建设的大道上的一块最重要的里程碑。代表大会的决议是马克思列宁主义理论胜利的具体体现，在代表大会前夕出版的我们的导师和领袖斯大林同志的新的经典著作，使马克思列宁主义的理论更加丰富了。
    在“苏联社会主义经济问题”中，斯大林同志深刻地分析了我们的斗争和胜利的结果以及我们这个时代的根本问题，并且明确地规定了我们进一步发展的计划。我们的伟大领袖和导师的这部新的马克思主义著作具有非常重大的国际意义，它在思想上武装了世界共产主义运动，并把这个运动提高到新的水平。它发现了苏联人民取得的划时代胜利的推动力量，并向世界各国的劳动人民指出，我们是如何使我国的经济转上社会主义的轨道、我们是如何建立工人阶级和农民之间的友谊、我们是如何把我们的国家变成一个富强的国家的。
    斯大林同志告诉我们，十月革命之所以能够胜利，我国社会主义社会之所以能够建成，是由于我们有了工农联盟这样一支社会力量，这支力量粉碎了资本主义社会腐朽力量的抵抗，并给生产关系必须符合生产力性质这个在客观上起作用的经济法则以自由活动的范围。
    根据这个客观经济法则，苏维埃政府已使生产资料社会化、使它们变成了全民的财产，从而废除了剥削制度、建立了社会主义的经济形式。
    由于实行了国家社会主义工业化和农业集体化的政策，我们的国家在战前几个斯大林五年计划时期大踏步地飞跃地前进，由一个在技术和经济上落后的农业国变成了一个先进的、社会主义的工业强国。
    过去三十五年的事实不断地表现和证实了苏维埃社会制度和国家制度的不可战胜的活力。我们的国家不仅光荣地经受了伟大卫国战争的严重考验；而且消灭了希特勒军队，拯救世界免于法西斯奴役的威胁。战后，苏联人民迅速地恢复了他们受战争破坏的工业、运输业和农业，然后使国民经济各部门的产量大大超过了战前的水平。
    苏联人民以极大的热情欢迎第十九次党代表大会通过的共产主义建设计划。他们坚决相信这个宏伟的计划必将实现。
    我们每天沿着通往共产主义的道路胜利前进，我们的前进使民主和社会主义阵营的力量和国际威望不断增长，并且鼓舞了世界各国的劳动人民进行反对帝国主义的革命斗争。
    这些天来，各国千百万人民的眼睛都转向苏联，它像一座巨大的灯塔屹立在世界上，为人类指明走向更光明的未来的道路。世界各国的进步男女和强大的民主、社会主义阵营正在和我们一起庆祝十月社会主义革命三十五周年。
    （一）苏联的国内情况
    在一九五二年，苏联人民在社会主义经济文化各部门都获得了新的成就。
    根据斯大林同志所发现的社会主义基本经济法则的要求，共产党和苏维埃政府使我们国家的经济朝着使经济各部门不断扩大、保证人民生活水平不断提高的方向发展。第十九次党代表大会关于苏联发展五年计划的指示生动地证明了这一点。
    随着这个新五年计划的完成，斯大林同志在一九四六年二月九日向选民发表的演说中所提出的要在其后三个五年时期中完成的具有历史意义的发展国民经济的方案一定可以在规定的时间内完成，而石油生产计划甚至在规定时间以前，即在现在这个五年计划时期中就可以完成。
    为着尽速完成斯大林第五个五年计划，现在全国已展开了一个社会主义竞赛运动。
    在这个竞赛运动中正出现成千成万新的、有才能的模范工作者；这个运动正发掘着进一步提高劳动生产率的巨大潜力；这个运动正发展着各种新的竞赛形式。高速熔炼法正以空前广泛的规模在冶金工业中应用着。采煤工业中的采掘面和长壁正在采用循环作业法，广泛地使用采煤联合机和装石机。石油工业中正在日益广泛地使用高速深井钻探法。机器制造工业中正在日益广泛地采用高速金属切削法。化学工业中正在日益广泛地采用连续不断的效率极高的操作方法。
    新技术和先进的劳动力组织方法的应用、工人技术的提高与费力操作的不断机械化，保证了国民经济各部门的劳动生产率不断提高。一九五二年工业方面的劳动生产率将比一九五○年高百分之十七，到一九五五年将提高约百分之五十。
    斯大林同志说，在苏联，各种机器节省了社会劳动力，减轻了工人的劳动。
    由于费力操作过程机械化和生产过程自动管理的结果，工业、运输业和农业工人的劳动大大减轻了。像采煤工业中的拖煤工人和手工掘煤工人、钢铁工业中的辗钢工人和石油工业中的汲桶管理工人等这些直到最近还需要用很多人的行业，现在已经没有了。相反地，新的行业已经出现了，像采煤联合机操使者、采油炼油机械师、涡轮式钻探机操使者、伐木业中的电锯工人和电力站的锅炉机械师等。
    有很大一部分已经获得这些新的专门技能的工人，都是受过中等教育并有相当丰富的技术知识的。他们是证明智力劳动与体力劳动的基本对立如何逐渐消失的活生生的例子。
    社会主义工业发展中的一个重要指标，就是减低生产成本。去年因减低生产成本而能使物价降低所节省下来的款项，共达三百五十五亿卢布，一九五二年将超过四百六十亿卢布。
    在一九五二年的头十个月中，整个工业生产计划完成了百分之一百零一以上。一九五一年和一九五二年的工业总产量每年增加的平均比率将为百分之十四以上，而五年计划中规定增加百分之十二。
    国民经济各部门发展的基础是重工业。
    五年计划的指示规定生产资料产量每年增加的平均比率为百分之十三。实际上，在新五年计划的头两年中，这种平均比率将达百分之十五。我们的大规模工业现在九天的产量就等于在伟大的十月社会主义革命前夕的俄国一年的产量。
    苏联钢铁工业的各部门都完成了它一九五二年头十个月的计划：铁——百分之一百零三；钢——百分之一百零一；压延金属——百分之一百零二。在第五个五年计划的头两年中所生产出的钢，将为第四个五年计划头两年中所生产出的钢的二点四倍。
    今年头十个月的煤的生产计划，完成了百分之一百零一。今年所生产的煤，将比一九五○年多百分之十五。把苏联煤工业的发展来与英国比较一下，是很有趣的。俄国在一九一三年所生产的煤，仅及英国的十分之一，而到一九五一年，苏联所生产的煤，却比英国多百分之二十五。在这一段时期中，英国的煤的产量下降了百分之二十三，而苏联则增加到将近十倍。
    苏联的石油工业正在迅速地发展。一九五二年头十个月的生产计划，完成了百分之一百零一。与一九五○年相比，石油产量增加了百分之二十四。炼油计划，汽油、润滑油和其他产品的生产计划也都超额完成了。
    化学工业、有色金属工业和建筑材料工业，都完成了它们一九五二年头十个月的计划。
    技术进步和国民经济各部门的迅速发展，有赖于我们的机器制造工业的不断扩展。今年机器制造工业的总产量，将比一九五○年的总产量增加百分之四十以上。在为电力工业、冶金工业和石油工业制造设备方面，发展速度最快。
    我们都知道，在电气化方面，五年计划规定迅速增加电力站的发电能力和发电量，以便电气化的发展能够赶上迅速发展的国民经济。关于电气化在建设共产主义社会方面所占的重要性，列宁在其有名的公式里曾经给以辉煌的阐释：“共产主义是苏维埃政权加全国电气化”。三十五年以来，苏联人民在使国家电气化方面获得了卓越的成就。过去好几年来，苏联平均每年增加的发电能力为执行“全俄电气化国家委员会”计划的十年中所增加的发电能力的两倍。
    今年的发电量要比一九五○年增加百分之二十九。
    苏联电力站目前仅在一个月中间的发电量，就抵得上革命以前的俄国在五年中间的发电量。
    消费品的产量今年也大大增加。新五年计划指示中原定消费品产量每年平均增加百分之十一，但在新五年计划的头两年中每年平均就增加了百分之十三以上。
    轻工业与食品工业每年都在扩充，消费品与食品的生产都在增加。在第五个五年计划的头两年里，食品工业的产量增加了百分之二十五以上，产品的质量与种类都有了改进。
    人民今年要比一九五○年得到更多的制成品与食品：服装——增加百分之二十七；皮鞋——增加百分之三十二；肉类与鱼类——增加百分之三十一；牛油、植物油与其他食用油脂——增加百分之三十一；糖——增加百分之五十八；糖果——增加百分之二十九。家庭用具例如冰箱、洗衣机、真空吸尘器等等也都有了增加。但是，一方面我们社会主义的工业在今年获得了巨大的成就，另一方面我们应当不要忽略在有些工业部门及个别工厂里，在工作中还存在着严重缺点。
    有些工业部门的工作不能令人满意，它们没有完成关于提高产量和减低成本的计划。
    还有些工厂没有生产出所规定的全部产品，而且所生产出的产品质量也不高，它们不遵守政府所规定的标准及技术条件。
    那些没有完成国家计划或者生产出质量低劣产品的工厂和工业部门的负责人，最好请他们记住，如果他们不改正错误，他们就得走开，让那些比他们有能力的、熟悉业务的负责人来干。
    在过去两年中，农业进展很快。耕种面积扩大了，尤其是最有价值的粮食作物——小麦。
    大家知道，今年谷物总收获量达八十亿普特，小麦收获量比一九四○年增加了百分之四十八。因此，粮食这个一向被认为是我们最严重的问题，目前已胜利地、肯定地、最后地解决了。棉花、甜菜、亚麻、向日葵及马铃薯的收获量也比去年增加了。
    在饲畜业方面也有了新的成就。在一九五○年七月到一九五二年七月这段期间，各种农场上各类牲畜的总数增加了二千六百七十万头。
    在全苏联，牲畜产品的总产量及商品产量，都超过了战前水平。
    农业的技术基础已因获得大量新拖拉机、卡车和农业机器而进一步加强，因而现在主要耕作过程的机械化的程度更大了。在一九五二年，集体农庄的主要田间工作有四分之三是由机器拖拉机站的拖拉机和机器完成的。棉花、甜菜及其他工业作物的种植工作现在实际已百分之百地机械化了。集体农庄的谷物种植面积有百分之七十以上是用联合收割机收割的。由机器摘、轧的棉花的数量，正逐年增加中。
    苏联欧洲部分的草原区和森林草原区的农民，正胜利地执行斯大林的种植防护林带的计划。单在过去两年中，这些地区造林的面积已将近一百五十万公顷。
    我党第十九次代表大会已向农业提出了进一步增加农作物产量和发展饲畜业的新的伟大的任务。
    为了胜利地完成这些任务，首先就必须消除集体农庄、国营农场和机器拖拉机站的工作中存在的缺点。必须提高田间工作的质量，缩短田间工作的时间；更有效地使用拖拉机及其他农业机器，增大机器拖拉机站在使集体农庄完成作物生产量和谷物总收获量计划方面的组织作用。
    集体农庄的男女农民和全体农业工人已保证要为完成第二个斯大林战后五年计划而努力工作。因此毫无疑问，新五年计划规定的农业方面的目标是一定会达到的。
    与我们的工业和农业一样，我们的铁路和水路运输系统也正在稳步发展。今年，我们的铁路运货量将比一九五○年增加百分之二十三，内河运货量将增加百分之二十一，海路运货量将增加百分之二十二。我们铁路的电气化工作正大大扩展中。新的海船和内河轮船正在添置中。
    今年，乌·伊·列宁（伏尔加河—顿河）运河——斯大林时代的伟大建设工程之一——开始通航了。
    社会主义生产的基本目的是使社会上不断增长的物质和文化需要得到最大限度的满足。苏联人民的生活和文化水平正在不断提高。供销售的消费品的数量日益增加。一九五二年国家和合作社零售贸易的销售额比一九五○年增加了百分之二十七。
    今年四月间，食品和制成品的国家价格实行了战后第五次的减价。这就是说实际工资和薪水进一步提高，农民们在购买制成品上可以更少花一些钱了。
    为了继续不断改善劳动人民的居住情况，我们的房屋建筑计划正在逐年扩充。
    一九五一年和一九五二年头十个月中，在城市和工人住宅区所建筑的新房屋的居住面积共达四千三百万平方公尺。这相当于一百多万幢两间房间的平房。农村地区已建筑了六十二万幢房屋。
    我国首都莫斯科在一九五二年建筑的房屋数量将接近战前一九四○年的两倍。第一批高大建筑物已经完成了，它们都是一些宏伟的高楼大厦。国民收入的增加是我国劳动人民生活日益繁荣的客观指标。今年苏联的国民收入将比一九五○年增加百分之二十五。由于国民收入的增加，才有可能大大提高人民的收入和增加国民经济中的投资。
    目前的五年计划规定把工业方面的投资增为第四个五年计划的两倍左右。许多工厂、矿场、电力站和铁路将建设起来或予以扩充。一九五二年国家基本建设工程比一九五○年大百分之二十六。
    伏尔加河、第聂伯河、顿河和阿姆河上的巨大的斯大林工程占有特别的位置。一九五二年这些工程的建设工作将比一九五一年增加一倍。这种工作正在按照计划顺利地进行中。
    在过去几年中，我们已经在大规模地从个别建筑过程的机械化过渡到全面的机械化，高速度的、新式的建筑方法正在广泛地使用着。
    由于新式机器的使用，更有效的工作组织以及建筑者的文化和技术水平的提高，一九五二年建筑工业的劳动生产率将比一九五○年提高百分之二十。
    但是，在建筑机构的工作中仍然有严重的缺点。主要的缺点是未按照规定的时间表完成建筑工程以及未按照计划减低建筑成本。必须采取坚决的措施来消灭这些缺点。
    在过去这几年中，苏联人民在科学、文化和艺术方面也获得了巨大的成就。
    与实行七年制普及教育的同时，中等（十年制）教育正在扩大。这样就使我们能够在这个五年计划时期结束以前在各共和国的首都和大城市中，在各州和边疆区及其他重要工业中心区实施普及中等教育（十年制）。我们必须准备在下一个五年期间在所有其他城市和乡村实施普及中等教育。同时我们也必须为实施普及技术教育作充分的准备工作。
    今年在各大学、学院及中等职业学校上学的学生比往年要多得多。苏联的大学和大学生的数目，比所有欧洲资本主义国家的大学和大学生加在一起的数目还多一倍半以上。第五个五年计划头二年毕业出来的青年专家比第四个五年计划头二年毕业的要多百分之六十五。由于共产党和苏维埃政府经常的关怀，我国初级小学、中等学校、中等职业学校、学院和大学的数目一年一年地在增加。
    根据斯大林同志的倡议修建的国立莫斯科大学的新的壮丽的建筑物，即将完成。
    党和政府对苏联人民的健康是非常关怀的。今年公共卫生的经费将达二百七十七亿卢布。更多的医院、诊疗所、休养所及疗养院正在建筑中。药品和医疗器械的产量今年已经大大地增加了。在过去几年中，由于医疗的不断改进和人民生活日益富裕，我国的出生率已经提高，而疾病和死亡率已经大大降低。
    苏联人民在科学和技术方面获得了高速度的进展。关于这一点的令人信服的证明，是具有空前规模和复杂性的水力工程的设计与建设的成功、高楼大厦的建立和极复杂的机器与设备的设计和生产。获得这种进展的原因之一是：我们在工业和农业中的先进工人的经验，使科学不断丰富起来。
    现在，没有哪一种机器、器械、仪器或技术过程是苏联专家和工人所不能设计的。在过去这些年里，苏联科学院各个研究所已经大大扩充，新的、拥有优越设备的实验大厦已经建立起来。苏联工业以极其精确的测量仪器和最新式的实验设备供给科学家。
    所有这些都丰富了各个科学部门的理论知识，特别是利用原子能造福人类方面的理论知识。
    在过去这三十五年里，多民族的苏联的各族人民在经济与文化上发生了巨大的变化。伟大的十月社会主义革命把各个民族从政治的、民族的和经济的压迫下解放出来。在共产党的领导下，在经济和文化上落后的民族地区，已经发展成为拥有欣欣向荣的工业和集体农庄的社会主义共和国了。
    原先的资产阶级民族再也不见了；代之而起的是新的先进的社会主义民族，它们发展了和壮大了。
    列宁—斯大林民族政策保证了苏联各族人民的科学、文化和艺术的发展。它们的学校、学院、大学、科学研究所、俱乐部、图书馆和剧院日益增多。各加盟共和国有自己的科学院。它们训练出了大批本民族的工农业专家和它们自己的知识分子。
    新五年计划规定的各加盟共和国的经济和文化的进一步发展，将有助于加强苏联各族人民之间的友好关系和我们苏维埃国家的实力。
    我国人民一方面执行他们的和平的社会主义建设计划，另一方面从来没有忘记苏维埃国家的缔造者列宁和斯大林的告诫：必须巩固社会主义国家的国防，极力加强苏联陆军和海军，并使它们保持战斗的准备。苏联的武装部队从社会主义工业方面获得最新式的武器和军事装备。
    但是，我们军队的实力，不仅是由于它的头等的装备，而且是由于它的无比的政治素质、它的战斗员与指挥员的爱国精神以及它与围绕在它周围的怀着热爱和关切心情的人民之间的牢不可破的联系。苏维埃陆军和海军的全体指战员都知道他们的使命是保卫他们的社会主义祖国，保护苏联人民的和平劳动——他们以此为荣。历史已经证明，这样的军队是不可战胜的！
    如果美国战争贩子和他们的走狗忘记苏军的力量，忘记它准备随时给胆敢冒险侵犯我们伟大的祖国的边界的一切侵略者以致命的还击，他们就错了。
    同志们，我们在社会主义建设的各个方面获得的成就是巨大的。但是，沾沾自喜和自负是与列宁和斯大林的党教养出来的苏联人民不相容的，他们认为已经获得的成就是获得新成就的有利基础。
    第十九次党代表大会曾强调指出对我们工作中的缺点大胆展开批评与自我批评的重要性。
    苏联人民将履行我党代表大会的这个具有历史意义的告诫，并且以最大的决心来消灭共产主义建设工作各个方面的缺点，从而完成并超额完成伟大的第五个五年计划！
    （二）苏联的外交政策与促进世界和平
    苏联人民献身于英雄的劳动，为全世界劳动人民铺平走向更美好的将来的道路。
    过去的三十五年充分证实了列宁和斯大林所发表的关于伟大的十月社会主义革命的世界历史任务和意义的言论。我们伟大的领袖们一再指出：十月革命的国际意义不仅表现在它对一切国家发生影响这个“广泛”的意义上，而且还表现在它的主要特点和发展法则在世界范围内重现这个“狭义”的意义上。
    伟大的列宁说：“我们的道路是正确的道路，因为其他国家不可避免地迟早也要走这条道路。”这个预言正在实现。
    由于苏联人民在第二次世界大战中取得了英雄的胜利，人口总共在六亿以上的国家已脱离了资本主义体系，并和苏联一道组成了强大的民主与社会主义阵营。
    一九五二年，人民民主国家在经济和文化各方面也有了进一步的发展。
    与一九五一年相比，今年捷克斯洛伐克、波兰、罗马尼亚、匈牙利和保加利亚的工业产量增加了百分之二十二到百分之二十五，阿尔巴尼亚的工业产量增加了百分之八十以上。大工业与中等工业的总产量将比战前增加好几倍。
    各人民民主国家正在以高速度实行电气化。与一九五○年相比，一九五二年波兰和捷克斯洛伐克的发电量增加了百分之二十四或百分之二十五，匈牙利和罗马尼亚增加了百分之三十八，保加利亚增加了百分之七十七，阿尔巴尼亚增加到三倍以上，德意志民主共和国增加了百分之二十二。这些国家之间的友谊与合作所采取的形式之一是：一个国家的电力顺利地输送到另一国家——由罗马尼亚输送到保加利亚，由波兰输送到捷克斯洛伐克，以及德意志民主共和国与波兰之间的电力交流。
    各人民民主国家的经济之所以能够迅速发展，在很大程度上是由于苏联给它们以广泛的兄弟般的援助。在欧洲人民民主国家和中华人民共和国，许许多多新的工厂和发电站已在开工，这些工厂和发电站是按照苏联专家的设计建造和用苏联工厂制造的机器装备起来的。
    在苏联的帮助下，各人民民主国家正在有效地发展和改造着它们的农业。这种改造工作中的一种重要工具，就是在一切人民民主国家里建立起来的、为政府所有的机器拖拉机站。各人民民主国家劳动农民参加合作社和组织农业生产合作社的运动正在扩展着。
    在所有的欧洲人民民主国家里，伴随着总的经济发展而来的是劳动人民生活水准的迅速提高。
    中华人民共和国自从它的人民在共产党领导下结束了帝国主义者及其走狗国民党匪帮的统治，并且把政权掌握在自己手中以来，也获得了很大的进展。
    一九五一年，工业产量相当于一九四九年的两倍多，到一九五一年年底，若干工业部门的产量达到了，某些产品甚至超过了战前的最高水平。
    中国全国差不多全部完成的伟大的土地改革，已经使农业得到了良好的成果。中华人民共和国现在种植的谷物与棉花，已经足够满足人民的需要，甚至能够对其他国家输出农产品。
    所有的人民民主国家的经济发展，令人信服地证明了：美帝国主义者对民主与社会主义阵营实行的经济封锁政策已经完全失败。那些实行这种封锁政策的人反而自食其果。至于民主与社会主义阵营国家，它们团结得更加紧密，建立了经济合作和互助，并且开辟了和资本主义世界市场相对峙的自己的世界市场，从而给了封锁政策以还击。
    斯大林同志说：“第二次世界大战及其经济影响在经济方面的最重要的结果是，必须认为统一的无所不包的世界市场的瓦解，这个情况决定了世界资本主义体系总危机的进一步加深。”
    马林科夫同志在第十九次代表大会上所作的共产党中央委员会的报告里，对目前总的国际形势作了深刻的马克思主义的分析，并且举出事实和数字，令人信服地说明：一方面，民主与社会主义阵营的力量日益增长；另一方面，世界资本主义的总危机日益加深。目前整个世界经济状况的特点有两条发展路线。
    “一条路线是苏联和各人民民主国家和平经济的不断发展，这种经济不会遭遇危机，它的目的是使社会的物质和文化需要得到最大限度的满足……。
    另一条路线是生产力停滞不前的资本主义经济。这种经济正陷于愈来愈加深的资本主义总危机和经常反复发生的经济危机的困境中。这是经济军事化和军事生产部门片面发展的路线；这是许多国家相互竞争、某些国家奴役其他国家的路线。”
    美国和英国、美国和法国以及其他欧洲资本主义国家间的矛盾正在日趋尖锐。美国垄断资本家和英国垄断资本家公开进行斗争，争夺石油、橡胶、有色金属和硫黄的出产地以及销售货物的市场。西德资本家和法国资本家在所谓欧洲煤钢联营问题上存在着矛盾，因此西德和法国之间的尖锐冲突正在成熟中。它们在萨尔问题上的矛盾也越来越尖锐了。
    为了要设法摆脱在第二次世界大战后变得更加明显的资本主义总危机，美帝国主义者正在准备发动另一次世界大战。他们的目的是建立他们在全世界上的霸权。但是帝国主义阵营在美国压力下所进行的疯狂的扩张军备运动，日益加深了促使这个阵营分崩离析的困难和矛盾。并且将不可避免地引起经济危机。
    若干时间以来，资本主义国家的生产一直处于停滞状态。如果我们以一九五一年第一季的数字为一百，那末美国每季工业生产的指数将如下表：
    一九五一年第一季    一○○
    第二季    一○三
    第三季    一○一
    第四季    一○一
    一九五二年    第一季    一○○
    第二季    九七
    从这些数字中可以看到，工业生产的指数在一九五一年第二季达到最高峰，然后开始下降。在今年第一季，工业生产的指数和去年第一季的水平一样，随后即更进一步下降。尽管扩张军备运动正在全力进行，但是整个工业生产的水平却在下降。原因是很明显的。民用工业被削减得这样厉害，以致连战争工业的全面扩张也不能抵消所削减的数量。因此，美国经济畸形发展的后果已表现很尖锐了。
    已采取扩张军备的方针的欧洲各资本主义国家，也在削减民用生产，从而造成了工业的停滞。
    战争经济正在消耗着大量的资源。若干年以来，美国的预算一直是典型的战争预算。例如在一九五二—五三会计年度的预算中，直接军事费用占百分之七十四，这个数字比朝鲜战争爆发前的军事费用多两倍以上。
    在一九四九—五零会计年度中，大西洋集团西欧成员国的军事费用共达六十二亿美元。在一九五二—五三会计年度的预算中，在美国统治者的要求下，这种军事费用将增加到一百六十亿美元左右。
    扩张军备运动是亿万富翁与百万富翁们取得空前庞大的利润的来源。在战后七年中，美国垄断资本家所获得的利润共约二千二百亿美元。另一方面，对一般人征的税则在以空前的速度增加着。报纸上说，杜鲁门在总统任期内所收的税，比在他以前的三十一个美国总统所收的税的总和还要多。
    在侵略阵营的所有国家里，已经够严重的通货膨胀，由于扩张军备运动而更加严重了。市场上充斥着纸币。货币的购买力正在有规律地降低着，而消费品的价格则在不断上涨。生活水准迅速下降。劳动群众的生活状况日益恶化。单是在美国、日本、英国、意大利、比利时、西德，完全失业和部分失业的总人数就有三千二百万。工人的罢工与政治示威的浪潮正在高涨。
    资产阶级经济学家已不再争论是否要发生另一次经济危机的问题，而是争论它在什么时候发生的问题了。各种经济研究机关都在公开警告企业界“准备应付”不可避免的、迫在眉睫的危机，这一点是意味深长的。
    同时，为了转移工人对于他们的悲惨的生活处境的注意，美国亿万富翁的庞大宣传机器正在人为地煽动战争恐怖。它正在使人民习惯于所谓使用原子弹是不可避免的说法；它日复一日地不仅恐吓成年人，而且还恐吓儿童，特别以制造假空袭警报的方式来这样做。后果是很明显的。许多美国人已经失掉了心境的平静。他们不断地注视着天空，一些人甚至想像他们看到了奇异的东西，他们说这些东西好像庞大的“飞盘”、“飞碟”、“飞锅”或“绿火球”。美国报纸和杂志经常刊载“一个目击者”的叙述，说他看到了这些怪东西，并且断言它们即使不是俄国的某种秘密投射器，至少也是由某一个其他星球上派来看看美国是什么情况的飞行机器！这多么会使我们想起“疑心生暗鬼”这一句俄罗斯谚语啊！
    斯大林同志在向第十九次党代表大会发表的历史性演说中说，在资本主义国家中，人权平等和民族平等的原则被践踏了，这种原则已代之以从事剥削的少数人享有充分权利而公民中被剥削的大多数人则毫无权利的原则。现在，仅仅那些有资本的人们才被承认有个人权利，而所有其他的公民则被当作是只适于供剥削的人类原料。美国统治者公然走上了法西斯的道路。他们正跟着希特勒的足迹走。他们在国内建立了恐怖统治，他们试图压制一切进步力量，他们差不多已宣布共产党为非法，他们在他们所雇用的暴徒的帮助下，驱散民主组织安排的集会。为了发动另一次帝国主义战争夺取世界霸权而进行的宣传和准备工作，已经达到前所未有的规模。
    美国统治者既已准备发动另一次世界大战，于是就在欧洲、亚洲和近中东建立军事基地网，在这些地区驻扎武装部队。他们一味破坏国际合作。美帝国主义者一心指望复活德国军国主义，因此他们竭力想保存德国的分裂局面，并把西德变成美国的军事基地。为了这个目的，他们硬要批准波恩协定和巴黎条约，以建立所谓欧洲防御集团。在亚洲，他们正在狂热地复活日本军国主义。正是为了这种目的，他们强迫日本接受单独和约，这是一个旨在把日本也变成美国的军事基地的军事条约。
    两年半以前，美帝国主义者对英雄的朝鲜人民发动了血腥的战争。
    美国已成为全世界反动力量和法西斯的大本营，已成为侵略者破坏国际和平与安全的世界规模的阴谋的中心。
    无怪乎各地普通人民这样切齿痛恨美国军队，因为他们正在用他们的马靴践踏各国人民的权利和自由。
    但是美国战争贩子们是没有力量扭转历史的车轮的。各国人民争取从帝国主义奴役下得到解放的斗争正在迅速展开。
    即使主张美国资本主义掌握世界霸权的最蛮横的家伙，如杜勒斯之流，也因各国人民争取解放的运动声势日益浩大而感到恐慌，他们不得不公开承认欧洲和亚洲各国的反美情绪正在增长。
    美帝国主义者所拼凑的侵略性的大西洋军事集团，由于内部矛盾——美国和英国、美国和法国以及其他资本主义国家之间的矛盾，已日益分裂。欧洲各资本主义国家的统治者在人民大众和经济困难的压力下，愈来愈不得不对美国明目张胆发号施令的政策表示不满。
    “纽约时报”最近说：西欧各国政府因为感到它们对美国的依赖而厌烦透顶了。它还承认：更多的美国经济“援助”不会改善欧洲的情况，反而要使它恶化。
    事情已经到了这样的地步，英国、法国及其他资本主义国家不能永远容忍美国对于它们的统治和压迫了，它们迟早要设法脱离美国的奴役而走上独立发展的道路。
    十月社会主义革命不仅从帝国主义统治的中心震撼了它的基础；而且打击了它的后方、它的外围。它动摇了帝国主义在殖民地与附属国家的统治。
    由于第二次世界大战的结果，帝国主义殖民制度在它有裂缝的地方破裂了。在这一方面，中国人民的具有历史意义的胜利起了重要的作用。
    美国在侵略朝鲜人民的战争中的失败，生动地证明了帝国主义者想镇压各国人民的民族解放运动的企图已经失败。尽管他们野蛮地轰炸朝鲜城市，使用细菌武器、喷气式飞机和最新式的武器，美英军队仍然粉碎不了朝鲜人民的抵抗。
    朝鲜人民正在中国人民志愿军兄弟般的援助之下，在和他们的民族领袖金日成的领导下英勇地、坚强地保卫他们的独立和自由。
    各国人民斥责美国侵略者恬不知耻。各国人民不需要战争，他们拥护和平并且正在加强他们对战争贩子的抵抗。
    最近的亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议就是正在为和平而斗争的人民力量的强大示威，关于这次示威的重大意义，无论怎样估价都不会过分。总共拥有十六亿人口的三十七个国家的代表们坚定地宣布，战争贩子的阴谋今后将遇到比以往更加坚决的抵抗。和平力量正在增长。各国人民间的友谊正在加强。在帝国主义战争贩子的后方，普通人民正在发出越来越频繁、越来越响亮的呼声：“我们决不对社会主义国家的人民作战！”
    在争取和平的斗争中，苏联人民与人民民主国家人民间牢不可破的友谊正在不断地加强。
    中华人民共和国和苏联之间的伟大友谊正在不断加强，这个友谊是远东和世界持久和平的保证。
    我们伟大的祖国是不可攻破的和平堡垒。苏联人民不需要战争。全世界的人都知道这一点。我们国家的全部活动的基本精神是斯大林的和平政策，是从事和平建设劳动的政策，是建立国际友谊的政策。斯大林同志说过：“这与苏联，它的利益是决不能跟世界和平的事业分开的。”
    苏联政府的斯大林和平外交政策，是根据以下的论断：资本主义与共产主义和平共存和相互合作是可能的。要达到这个目的，必须具备以下的条件：双方都有合作的愿望，愿意严格履行所承担的义务，遵守相互平等以及不干涉别国内政的原则。
    在十月开幕的联合国大会会议上，苏联和人民民主国家的代表们像往常一样，一贯地揭露美国统治者的独裁的侵略阴谋。苏联代表又一次提出了真正促进和平与国际安全的具体计划。
    只有那些不可救药的蠢材，才会认为苏联政府的和平政策是我国软弱的表示。苏联人民绝不是胆小怕事的人。他们绝不害怕战争。苏维埃国家的不可战胜的伟大力量已经屡次得到证明，无论在帝国主义者对于年青的苏维埃共和国进行干涉的时期，或者在第二次世界大战的时期，都可以看得出来。现在苏联不仅已经不再孤立，而且还在民主与社会主义阵营里居于领导的地位，它的伟大的力量已经无限增长。
    伟大的苏联作家高尔基曾经写道：假若资本家们由于害怕他们不可避免的崩溃命运竟然狗急跳墙，调动匪军向我国进攻，那就“必须切切实实地给那些笨蛋们以迎头痛击，要使这一击成为对资本主义的致命打击，将它送入早已为历史所掘好了的坟墓里去。”如果侵略者竟敢冒险侵犯我国，这就是他们的命运。
    同志们，不朽的列宁说：共产主义到处都要生长。资产阶级政府的任何努力，任何迫害当代进步男女的法西斯暴力手段，都阻止不了共产主义思想在全世界广大劳动人民群众中间传播。任何力量都不能使历史的车轮倒转，都不能阻止社会向共产主义前进。
    苏联过去一年在发展社会主义经济与文化方面所获得的新成就，各人民民主国家在走向社会主义的道路上所得到的成就，以及和平与社会主义阵营的日益增长的力量，生动地证明了列宁与斯大林的学说的最高真理和无往不胜的力量。
    指导和组织我们走向共产主义的力量是苏联共产党，是正在为按照马克思—列宁主义学说改造人类社会而奋斗的思想一致的人们——共产党人——的战斗联盟。
    斯大林同志在第十九次党代表大会上的演说里说：
    “在一九一七年我们党取得政权以后，在我们党采取了实际措施消除了资本家和地主的压迫以后，兄弟党的代表们对我们党的勇敢和成功表示敬佩，给予我们党以世界革命工人运动‘突击队’的称号。他们以此表示他们希望这支‘突击队’的成功减轻在资本主义压迫下呻吟的各国人民的痛苦。”
    斯大林同志说：“我认为我们的党并没有辜负这种希望，特别是在第二次世界大战中，苏联粉碎了德国和日本法西斯暴力统治，使欧洲和亚洲各国人民解脱了法西斯奴役的威胁。”
    回顾过去的这些年，我们就可以知道：社会主义在我国取得胜利的道路并不是容易的。我们曾经遇到过许多困难。可是，我们的党经常有战斗的准备，胜利地克服了一切困难，消除了所有障碍。
    现在大家都明白：如果没有和人民密切联系并得到他们无限信任的英雄的列宁和斯大林的党，苏维埃政权就不会在我国存在三十五天，更谈不上三十五年了。
    苏联人民在共产党领导之下已使得他们的国家强大而不可战胜。我们党和我国人民的领袖斯大林同志的最大历史功绩就在这里。自从伟大的列宁逝世以后，斯大林同志二三十年来满怀信心地领导着我们的党和苏联人民，沿着未开辟的道路走向建设新的、共产主义的生活。这就是我国以及全世界的劳动人民对斯大林的英明领导表示无限信任的原因，这就是他们对共产党和天才的斯大林的政策这样信赖的原因。这就是苏联人民和全世界的劳动人民这样热爱斯大林同志的原因。
    开始了人类历史新纪元的伟大的十月社会主义革命万岁！
    和平、民主和社会主义的不可攻破的堡垒——强大的苏联万岁！
    列宁和斯大林的党——苏联共产党万岁！
    我们敬爱的导师和领袖——伟大的斯大林身体健康、万寿无疆！（震耳的、经久不息的掌声和欢呼声）在列宁—斯大林的旗帜下向共产主义前进！（别尔乌辛的演说一再被经久不息的掌声打断。在他的演说结束时，整个会场为全体进步人类的天才、苏联人民的历史性胜利的组织者和鼓舞者、英明的领袖和导师、伟大的斯大林而欢呼。）
