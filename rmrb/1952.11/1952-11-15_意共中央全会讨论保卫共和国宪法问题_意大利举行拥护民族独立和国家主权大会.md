Xinhua News Agency, Rome, November 14th: According to TASS, the Central Committee of the Italian Communist Party held a plenary session on November 10th and 11th to discuss Togliatti's report on "Defending the Republic's Constitution in Parliament and Nationwide."

    Italian Communist Party Deputy General Secretary Secchia said: Italian democrats have sufficient strength to defend the constitution and democratic freedoms. These forces include the Communist Party (which, as of October 31st, had 2,130,795 members) and the Italian Communist Youth League (which, as of the same date, had 455,556 members). Secchia pointed out that in regions where the Communist Party's role is not so strong, party organizations must strengthen their work.

    Communist Party Secretariat Secretary Scoccimarro said: The struggle to defend the constitution must be combined with the struggle for institutional reform. Communists and Socialists have begun the struggle for institutional reform by proposing bills to nationalize monopolistic power plants and the Montecatini chemical trust, to have the state manage the machine industry, to build public housing, and to provide free medical care for the poor.

    Communist Party Central Committee member Sereni said: American instructions determine the government's and the Christian Democratic Party's entire unconstitutional policy.
    He pointed out that preparations for the World People's Peace Congress must be launched.

    Vittorio said: The five million workers of the Italian General Confederation of Labor, regardless of their political views, unanimously condemn the government's draft "reform" of the electoral system and are prepared to support the struggle of democratic parties in parliament with mass action.

    Xinhua News Agency, Rome, November 11th: TASS, Rome, November 10th—The conference to uphold national independence and state sovereignty, initiated by the Italian Peace Committee, opened in Verona on November 8th. According to "Unità," hundreds of delegates from all regions of Italy attended the conference. Among the delegates were Senator Sereni, former Minister of Aviation Cifrotto, journalist Scalfari, and retired General Gestaldi. The Vice-President of the Senate, Molè (independent), and the Vice-President of the Chamber of Deputies, Targetti (Socialist), also declared their support for the conference's aims.

    In his opening speech at the conference, Cifrotto condemned the Italian government for ceding military bases to the United States.

    Scalfari then spoke, citing examples of how certain clauses in the so-called "London Agreement" seriously infringed upon Italian national sovereignty. He pointed out that even now, before the "London Agreement" has been ratified by the Italian parliament, American troops stationed in Italy are behaving tyrannically towards Italian citizens. He said that after the government ratifies the aforementioned agreement, these actions will only increase; and that occupying forces from other countries, perhaps including German forces, will also be stationed throughout Italy.

    Communist Party member of parliament Serbantini emphasized the need to keep public opinion informed of all facts related to foreign occupation. He spoke of the rampant behavior of American occupying forces in the Veneto region, especially the outrageous act of confiscating the land of hundreds of farmers for the construction of airports.

    Representatives from Naples, Livorno, and Udine spoke about the struggles of the residents of their cities against the American occupation.

    意共中央全会讨论保卫共和国宪法问题
    意大利举行拥护民族独立和国家主权大会
    【新华社十四日讯】据塔斯社罗马讯：意大利共产党中央委员会在十一月十日和十一日举行全体会议，讨论了陶里亚蒂关于“在议会和全国保卫共和国宪法”的报告。
    意大利共产党副总书记谢嘉说：意大利民主分子有足够的力量来保卫宪法和民主自由。这些力量包括共产党（到十月三十一日为止，它已经有二百一十三万零七百九十五个党员）和意大利共产主义青年团（到同一日为止，它已经有四十五万五千五百五十六个团员）。谢嘉指出：在共产党的作用还不是那么有力量的地区，党组织必须加强它们的工作。
    共产党书记处书记斯科西马罗说：保卫宪法的斗争必须和机构改革的斗争结合起来，共产党人和社会党人是这样开始进行机构改革斗争的：他们提出了把垄断性的电力厂和蒙特卡提尼化学托辣斯收归国有、由国家管理机器工业，修建民房和给贫穷人民以免费医疗等议案。
    共产党中央委员会委员塞伦尼说：美国的指示决定了政府和天主教民主党整个违反宪法的政策。
    他指出：必须展开世界人民和平大会的筹备工作。
    维多里奥说：意大利总工会的五百万工人都不分政见，万众一心地指责政府的选举制度“改革”草案，并且准备用群众行动来支持议会内民主党派的斗争。
    【新华社十一日讯】塔斯社罗马十日讯：意大利和平委员会所发起的拥护民族独立和国家主权大会于十一月八日在味罗那开幕。据“团结报”报道：参加大会的，有来自意大利各个地区的数百名代表。代表们中间有参议员塞伦尼，前航空部长齐佛罗托，记者斯卡尔佛利奥和退休的格斯达尔蒂将军。参议院副议长摩勒（无党派）和众议院副议长塔尔杰蒂（社会党）也宣称：他们支持大会的目的。
    齐佛罗托在大会开会辞中，谴责意大利政府出让军事基地给美国。
    斯卡尔佛利奥接着发言，他举出了所谓“伦敦协定”中的某些条款严重侵犯意大利国家主权的一些例子。他指出：就在目前，在“伦敦协定”还没有被意大利议会批准的时候，美国驻意大利军队已对意大利公民横行霸道起来。他说：在政府批准上述的协定之后，这些行动将更会加多；并且其他各国的占领部队，或许包括德国部队在内，也将驻扎在意大利各地。
    共产党议员塞尔班地尼强调必须随时让舆论知道一切有关外国占领的事实。他谈到美国占领军在文尼托地区的横行，特别是为了修建机场而没收了数百农民的土地的暴行。
    那不勒斯、里窝那和乌提纳的代表都谈到他们本城居民进行反对美国占领的斗争的情况。
