To the Editor:

We are over seven hundred construction workers participating in the construction of the Beijing Soviet Red Cross Hospital building. As working people all over the world celebrate the 35th anniversary of the great October Revolution and our people warmly welcome "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month," we sincerely thank Marshal Stalin, the Soviet government, and the Soviet people for their selfless assistance to China, and we thank Comrade Pukharov, director of the Beijing Soviet Red Cross Hospital, and all his staff for their warm care for our workers, who faithfully serve the Chinese people.

In May of this year, the building construction project started, and all our workers participated in this project with a high degree of enthusiasm. Because we know that this project is a hospital established by our dearest friends—the Soviet people—for our Chinese people. We must build the building strong and durable, and save materials as much as possible, to show the Chinese working class's friendship and gratitude to the Soviet people.

Not long after the start of the construction project, Comrade Pukharov, director of the Beijing Soviet Red Cross Hospital, and several Soviet doctors came to the construction site to comfort us, and warmly embraced, shook hands, and greeted us. They inspected the medical and health equipment at the construction site and found that the medical staff at the medical station, as well as medical equipment and medicines, were insufficient. Comrade Pukharov immediately told us that he would be responsible for improving the medical and health equipment at the construction site. The next day, the hospital brought us a large truckload of medical equipment and medicines and disinfected our dormitories and toilets. In addition, the hospital also sent a doctor to the medical station on the construction site every day. Not only can we work happily on a construction site with good hygiene conditions, but also sick and injured workers can receive timely treatment.

Comrade Pukharov's care for us is meticulous. Once, he asked a Chinese doctor at the construction site: How is the workers' food? The doctor couldn't answer. He pointed out: Doctors should pay attention to the workers' food. He immediately instructed the doctors on the construction site to report the workers' food situation regularly. Several times, when he came to the construction site, it happened to be our mealtime, and he personally tasted our food. In order to help us understand hygiene knowledge, he specially invited Comrade Vaskrisinsky, director of surgery at the hospital, to give us a report. Therefore, every time Director Pukharov and other Soviet comrades came, they brought us infinite strength. I remember once when Pukharov and other Soviet comrades came to see us, we were driving piles for the foundation. We lifted the six-hundred-pound hammer to the top of the frame and then hammered it down. Some comrades asked: Why are you so energetic today? We all said: This is the strength brought to us by the Soviet elder brother.

The Beijing Soviet Red Cross Hospital also gives seriously ill and injured workers free and priority hospitalization treatment. For example, strong worker Su Defu injured his waist in an accident in August, and electrician Su Jiyuan injured his ribs in an accident in October. After these accidents occurred, the construction site called the hospital. In less than ten minutes, two Soviet doctors arrived in an ambulance to pick up the injured. The injured not only received enthusiastic treatment in the hospital, but also lived very happily. They quickly recovered their health. Some workers suffering from long-term illnesses were also cured by the Beijing Soviet Red Cross Hospital. For example, carpenter Gu Zhongliang suffered from duodenitis for six or seven years, stayed in the hospital for 109 days, received many expensive injections, and was finally cured. Every worker who returns from the hospital excitedly reports to the workers about their happy life in the hospital and works more actively than before. They all say: It is really a disservice to the Soviet elder brother's care and help if we don't work hard.

The hospital also often sends people to the construction site to show movies, so that we have appropriate cultural activities. We saw the happy life of the Soviet people, which greatly strengthened our determination and strength to work hard for the bright future of New China. On the evening of National Day, Comrade Pukharov and other Soviet friends jointly organized a gala with us. Comrade Pukharov said at the meeting: "On the National Day of New China, I was able to see the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, on the reviewing stand. It is a great honor! I must faithfully carry out the tasks assigned to me by Marshal Stalin! I guarantee to run the hospital well. I guarantee to treat your illnesses and work injuries in a timely and enthusiastic manner." Finally, he said: "Let us, the Soviet and Chinese people, unite firmly and work together for the happiness of the people of both countries and the cause of world peace!" We expressed our gratitude with thunderous applause, and also made a guarantee to Comrade Pukharov: We will build the hospital building strong and durable, save materials, and strive to complete it ahead of schedule.

Today, we once again make a solemn guarantee: We, all the workers at the Beijing Soviet Red Cross Hospital construction site, like the working class of the whole of China, will always be firmly united with the Soviet people and fight to the end for the cause of world peace!

    参加医院建筑的工人们受到亲切的关怀
    编辑同志：我们是参加建筑北京苏联红十字医院大楼的七百多个建筑工人。当全世界劳动人民庆祝伟大的十月革命三十五周年和我国人民热烈迎接
    “中苏友好月”的今天，我们要挚诚地感谢斯大林大元帅、苏联政府和苏联人民对中国无私的援助，感谢忠实为中国人民服务的北京苏联红十字医院院长甫罗哈洛夫同志及其全体工作人员对我们工人的热情关怀。
    今年五月，大楼建筑工程开工，我们全体工人以高度的积极性参加了这个工程。因为我们知道：这个工程是我们最亲切的友人——苏联人民为了我们中国人民而设立的医院。我们一定要把楼房盖的坚固耐久，要尽量节省材料，来表现中国工人阶级对苏联人民的友好和感谢。
    在建筑工程开工后不久的一天，北京苏联红十字医院院长甫罗哈洛夫同志和几位苏联医生同志就到工地来慰劳我们，和我们热烈地拥抱、握手和问好。他们检查了工地的医疗卫生设备，发现医疗站医务人员以及医疗器具和药品都不够。甫罗哈洛夫同志立刻向我们说，他一定负责改善工地的医疗卫生设备。第二天，医院就给我们拉来一大汽车的医疗器具和药品，并为我们的宿舍和厕所进行消毒。此外，医院每天还派一个大夫到工地医疗站值班。我们不但能够在卫生情况很好的工地上愉快地工作着，而且患病和工伤的工友们也都能得到及时的治疗。
    甫罗哈洛夫同志对我们的关怀是无微不至的。有一次，他问工地的一个中国医生：工人们的伙食怎样？这个医生答不出来。他就指出：医生应该注意工人的伙食。他立刻嘱咐工地上的医生们定期报告工人的伙食情况。有好几次，他到工地来时恰好我们开饭，他就亲自尝了我们的饭。他为了让我们懂得卫生常识，特地请医院里的外科主任瓦斯克里辛斯基同志给我们作报告。因此，甫罗哈洛夫院长等苏联同志每来一次，就给我们带来了无限的力量。记得有一次甫罗哈洛夫等苏联同志来看我们时，我们正在打桩基。我们把六百多斤重的铁锤都提到了架子的顶头，然后打下去。有的同志问：今天为啥劲头这样大。我们大家都说：这是苏联老大哥给我们带来的力量。
    北京苏联红十字医院还给我们重病和重伤的工人以免费优先住院治疗的照顾。如壮工苏德甫八月间因工把腰部摔伤，电工苏纪元在十月间把肋部摔伤。这些事故发生后，工地给医院里打了电话。没过十分钟，两位苏联大夫坐着救护车来把伤号接走。伤号们在医院里不但得到热心的治疗，并且生活得十分愉快。他们很快地恢复了健康。有些工人患着长期没有治好的病，也由北京苏联红十字医院给治好了。如木工顾忠良患了六、七年的十二指肠炎，在医院里住了一○九天，打了许多贵重药针，终于治好了。每一个从医院回来的工友，都兴奋地向工友们报告在医院里愉快生活的情况，而且比以前更积极地工作着。他们都说：不好好工作，真是对不起苏联老大哥对我们的关心和帮助。
    医院还经常派人来到工地放映电影，使我们有适当的文化生活。我们看到了苏联人民的幸福生活，大大增强了我们为新中国美好的前途而努力的决心和力量。在国庆节那天晚上，甫罗哈洛夫同志等苏联朋友和我们共同组织了联欢晚会。甫罗哈洛夫同志在会上说：“在新中国国庆节，我能在观礼台上看见了中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席，真是无限的光荣！我一定要忠实地执行斯大林大元帅交给我的任务！我保证把医院办好。我保证及时地、热心地治疗你们的疾病和工伤。”最后，他又说道：“让我们苏中两国人民坚强地团结在一起，共同为两国人民的幸福和世界和平事业而奋斗！”我们用雷鸣般的掌声热烈地表示了我们感激的心情，并且也向甫罗哈洛夫同志提出了保证：要把医院大楼盖得坚固耐久，节省材料，争取提前完工。
    今天，我们再一次提出庄严的保证：我们北京苏联红十字医院工地全体工人，和全中国的工人阶级一样，要永远坚强地和苏联人民团结在一起，为世界的和平事业而奋斗到底！
