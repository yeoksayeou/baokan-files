How Peking University is Experimenting with a Speed Reading Method for Russian Professional Books
Beijing University Russian Professional Book Speed Reading Method Experiment Group

Since liberation, many teachers at Peking University have participated in Russian language learning, but the results have not been very good. The reasons are: First, the general teaching materials used are not related to their professional work. The vocabulary and texts selected are mostly about daily life, such as "chair," "ceiling," "window," etc. As a result, many people study for a long time and still cannot read reference books. Second, teaching is generally carried out according to old teaching experiences, without asking what the students' learning objectives are, and always requiring "four skills" (listening, speaking, reading, and writing). However, Russian grammar, vocabulary, and syntax are extremely rich. Requiring "all-round development" will certainly not be effective in the short term. Most teachers are also very busy with their work and find it difficult to spare more time to persist in Russian language learning, so they gradually neglect it. Third, there is a lack of strong leadership, the teaching methods cannot be effectively studied and improved, and the learning comrades cannot be helped to solve difficulties in a timely manner. Everyone can only explore on their own, which directly affects the learning effect.

In order to improve our Russian teaching, we recently conducted experiments in two groups, A and B. The goal of Group A was to cultivate the ability to read "The History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) Short Course." The content of this book is relatively deep, and it is determined as reading material for various social science majors in the Faculty of Arts. Group B specializes in reading chemistry books. In the reading stage, it is further divided into three professional disciplines: organic chemistry, analytical chemistry, and physical chemistry.

Experiment Status and Effect of the Russian Professional Book Speed Reading Method

A total of twelve people participated in Group A's learning (including two professors, six teaching assistants and graduate students, and four students). Their original Russian foundation was very poor. Seven people had never studied Russian at all, and the rest had only studied for one or two weeks (only one person had studied for three or four months, but had mostly forgotten it by the time they participated in the experiment).

The students generally studied English for six or seven years, and some also studied Sanskrit, Latin, German, and French. However, one-third of them (mainly students) could not read English books fluently. The vast majority were under the age of thirty, and one was over the age of fifty. After studying, seven people achieved a test score of 90 or higher, and the overall average was 84. There were three exams during the learning process, and the results were good, with no one below 60. This shows that the students' acceptance ability is relatively good. In terms of reading, when they finally entered the completely self-study stage, all students were able to read independently. Although they sometimes encountered idioms and difficult sentences that they had not learned, the problems were solved by looking up dictionaries and asking others. In four days, they spent the first two days reading "The History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) Short Course" and the last two days reading Kaganovich's "Stalin Leads Us Forward to the Victory of Communism." The former is more difficult; the latter is easier, roughly equivalent to ordinary editorials in "Pravda," and can be read as a model essay in general political papers. We investigated the students' reading effectiveness. Three people read more than one page of "The History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) Short Course" per hour; nine people read between 0.33 pages and one page per hour. When reading Kaganovich's paper, ten people read one page to 2.2 pages per hour, and two people read 0.5 pages to one page per hour.

A total of seventeen students participated in Group B's learning (including two professors, seven teaching assistants, six graduate students, and two students). Among them, seven people had never studied Russian at all, six people had studied Russian letters and the first ten lessons of Gu Yongzhong's Russian Reader, and four people had studied ten to twenty-five lessons. They generally studied English for six or seven years, but only about half of them could read English books fluently. Eight people had a foundation in two foreign languages. At the end of the study, with the exception of one student who withdrew from the study in the second stage due to circumstances, the other sixteen students were able to read chemistry books independently. Two people could read three to four pages per hour of science history, biographies of chemists, or deeper natural science theory books, five people could read 1.5 to 2 pages, six people could read one to 1.5 pages, and three people could read half a page to one page; nine people (five of whom had never studied Russian at all) could read three to four pages per hour of the properties and preparation methods of chemical elements and compounds, two people could read one to two pages, three people could read one to 1.5 pages, and two people could read half a page to one page. The above situation illustrates the following issues: First, although most students had no Russian foundation, or a very weak foundation, most of them were able to meet or exceed the original planned requirements upon graduation, and all were able to read independently. This shows that the speed reading method is suitable for people with no Russian foundation. Second, the four professors in the two groups were all relatively old, but their grades were very good in their studies. The reason may be that they studied seriously, had a serious attitude, had a deep professional knowledge, and had a good foreign language foundation, so their acceptance and understanding ability was stronger. But this is also enough to show that adults' memory is not weaker than that of young people, and they can also participate in speed reading learning. Third, most students can learn well in teaching, and it is not only individual talented students who can learn well. Therefore, it is possible to promote the speed reading method on a larger scale.

How is Teaching Conducted?

Group A's teaching time was a total of 31 days, excluding rest and class suspensions and meetings, the actual study time was about 28 and a half days (including exam review time), 240 to 270 hours. Each person studies between eight and nine hours a day, and most can reach nine hours. Group B's teaching time was 28 days. In addition to rest, class suspensions, and meeting time, the actual teaching time was 24 and a half days, about 190 to 210 hours, with an average of seven to eight hours of study per day. Teaching process: Groups A and B are each divided into several stages, each stage has its own focus, and a blitzkrieg approach is adopted for teaching; at the same time, according to the principle of combining key breakthroughs and review consolidation, review and exams are conducted at the end of each stage. However, the specific practices differ between Groups A and B in terms of textbook distribution and teaching progress due to the specific circumstances of each professional discipline. Based on experimental experience, we have made further modifications to the textbooks and plan to conduct the second experiment according to the following plan: Group A is required to complete the teaching work in 27 days. The first stage is 13 days (with the 7th and 12th days used for review and exams, and the 13th day for rest). The second stage is 7 days (with the 6th day used for review and exams, and the 7th day for rest). The third stage is 7 days. The first stage focuses on grammar. The second stage focuses on vocabulary and consolidates grammar as a secondary task. The third stage leads students to conduct extensive reading to cultivate their self-study ability. Therefore, the teaching time and tutoring time are equal in the first stage; the second stage is more tutoring and less teaching; the third stage starts with more teaching and less tutoring, and finally students conduct self-study. By the end, students can understand basic grammar and simple syntax, remember about 1600-1700 new words, and read 25 to 28 pages of "The History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) Short Course." Group B has the same study time as Group A. It is divided into four stages: the first stage is 11 days (9 days of classes, 1 day each for review, exams, and rest). The second stage is 7 days (5 days of classes, the rest for review, exams, and rest). The third stage is 7 days (6 days of classes, 1 day for review). The fourth stage is 2 days. The central task of the first stage is also to intensively study grammar (slightly different from Group A). The second stage mainly consolidates the achievements obtained in the grammar study stage, followed by a blitzkrieg on new words. The third stage mainly focuses on new words. At this time, the teaching materials are divided into three subjects: organic chemistry, inorganic chemistry, and physical chemistry, striving to be tailored to specific purposes, because only in this way can we combine the students' professional knowledge and achieve better learning results. The fourth stage leads students to conduct extensive reading to cultivate their ability to read independently.

Characteristics of the Speed Reading Method

From the experimental situation of the two groups, the Russian professional book speed reading method has five characteristics:

First, vocabulary, texts, and grammar are closely integrated with professional work. This is its practicality. General Russian teaching materials are often divorced from professional work. Some schools' grammar teachers and reader teachers do not communicate with each other throughout the year, so it is impossible to talk about close cooperation in teaching, and the effect is naturally very poor. The speed reading materials are completely practical, and the arrangement of texts and new words is closely integrated with the teaching materials of each major; the focus of grammar also varies depending on the professional discipline. The grammar content of Group B is generally simpler than that of Group A. Second, the purpose is clear. The requirement of the speed reading method is to read relevant professional books. Therefore, in the teaching process, it does not require "all-round development" and "four skills" like general teaching methods. Teachers should use all their strength to improve students' reading ability in teaching, and exercises and exams also focus on this aspect. Third, speed reading learning is a combat-oriented learning. New words, texts, and grammar come like a landslide. There is a lot of content. To complete this learning task, students must be required to treat learning with a fighting spirit. Therefore, we put forward the slogan "Drilling grammar is attacking fortresses, and memorizing new words is capturing prisoners." Fourth, concentrate energy and focus on breakthroughs. This is its concentration. In speed reading learning, students should put aside other social work or tedious housework and concentrate all their energy on learning. From the experimental situation, those who participate in other work during the study period do not have good learning results. Therefore, the administrative side should ensure that students temporarily get rid of other work and let them concentrate on learning. Secondly, the focus of each learning stage should be clear in speed reading learning. Only in this way can we achieve the effect of speed reading. Fifth, strengthen ideological education work. The leadership should pay attention to mobilizing students and staff from a political perspective to do a good job in teaching. In teaching, we must fight against conservative ideas, because speed reading learning is collective and different from individualistic teaching.

Finally, it must be pointed out that we must have a correct understanding of the speed reading method and cannot unilaterally exaggerate its role. Because this speed reading method is limited to the reading of professional books; secondly, twenty-odd days of speed reading learning can only enable students to lay the foundation for being able to read Russian professional books initially, and it cannot be said that the task of learning Russian has been completed.

    北京大学是怎样试验俄文专业书籍阅读速成法的
    北京大学俄文专业书籍阅读速成法试验组
    解放以后，北京大学有许多教师参加了俄文学习，但效果并不很好，原因是：第一、一般所用教材和业务无关，所选择的词汇和课文多是关于日常生活方面的，像“椅子”、“天花板”、“窗户”……等，因此许多人念了很长时间，还不会看参考书。第二、一般多按照旧的教学经验进行教学，不问学员的学习目的是什么，总是要求“四会”。而俄文语法和词汇、句法都极为丰富，要求“全面开花”，决不是短期内所能见效的，一般教师的工作又都很忙，很难抽出较多的时间来坚持俄文学习，因而慢慢就荒疏了。第三、缺乏坚强的领导，不能切实研究和改善教学方法，及时地帮助学习的同志解决困难，大家便只好分头摸索；这也直接地影响了学习效果。
    为了改进我们的俄文教学，我们最近分甲乙两个小组进行了试验。甲组以培养阅读“联共（布）党史简明教程”的能力为目标。这一部书的内容是比较深的，确定作为文法学院社会科学各专业学科的阅读材料。乙组专门阅读化学书籍。到阅读阶段时，又分有机化学、分析化学、物理化学等三个专业学科。
    俄文专业书籍阅读速成法的试验情况及其效果
    参加甲组学习的共十二人（包括教授二人，助教、研究生六人，同学四人）。他们原有的俄文基础都很差，计完全没有学过俄文的有七人，其余只学过一、二星期左右（仅一人学过三四个月，但到参加试验时也大部忘记了）。
    学员一般都学过六、七年英文，有的还学习过梵文、拉丁文、德文、法文。但其中有三分之一的人（主要是同学）不能流畅地阅读英文书籍。年龄绝大部分在三十岁以下，五十岁以上的有一人。经过学习，测验成绩达九十分的有七人，总平均为八十四分。学习过程中曾进行三次考试，成绩良好，没有六十分以下的。这说明学员的接受能力是比较好的。在阅读方面，当最后进入完全自学阶段时，全体学员都能独立地进行阅读，有时虽遇到未学过的成语及艰难句子，但查查字典，问问别人，问题也都解决了。四天中头两天阅读“联共（布）党史简明教程”，后两天阅读卡冈诺维奇所著“斯大林领导我们向共产主义的胜利前进”。前者较深；后者较易，约相当于“真理报”上的普通社论，可作为一般政治论文中的范文来读。我们调查了学员的阅读效果，每小时读“联共（布）党史简明教程”一页以上的有三人；每小时读○·三三页到一页的有九人。阅读卡冈诺维奇的论文时，每小时读一页到二．二页的有十人，每小时读○·五页到一页的有二人。
    参加乙组学习的学员共十七人（包括教授二人，助教七人，研究生六人，同学二人）。其中完全没有学过俄文的有七人，学过俄文字母及顾用中所编俄文读本开头十课的有六人，学过十课到二十五课的有四人。他们一般都学过六、七年英文，但是能流畅地阅读英文书籍的，只有半数左右。有八个人具有两种外国语文基础。学习结束时，这十七个学员除一人因故在第二阶段退出学习外，其他十六人都能独立地阅读化学书籍。每小时能阅读科学史、化学家传记或较深的自然科学理论书籍三页到四页的二人，一页半到二页的五人，一页到一页半的六人，半页到一页的三人；每小时能阅读化学原素、化合物的性质和制法部分三页到四页的九人（其中有五人完全没有学过俄文），一页到二页的二人，一页到一页半的三人，半页到一页的二人。上述情况说明了下面几个问题：第一，大部分学员虽没有俄文基础，或基础很薄弱，但结业时大部分能达到或超过原定计划的要求，全部能独立地进行阅读。这说明速成法适用于没有俄文基础的人。第二，两组中的四位教授年龄都比较大，但在学习中成绩都很好，原因可能是他们学习认真，态度严肃；业务知识较深；外文根基较好，所以接受程度和理解能力较强。但这也足以说明成年人记忆力并不弱于年轻的人，他们同样可以参加速成学习。第三，教学中绝大部分学员都能学好，并不是只有个别天才的学员才能学好。因此较大规模地推广速成学习法是可能的。
    怎样进行教学的
    甲组教学时间共三十一天，除去休息及停课、开会外，实际学习时间约为二十八天半（包括考试复习时间），二百四十到二百七十小时。每人每日学习在八、九小时之间，大部分可达到九小时。乙组教学时间共二十八天，除休息、停课、开会时间外，实际教学时间共二十四天半，约一百九十至二百一十小时，平均每日学习七到八小时。教学进程：甲乙两组各分为若干阶段，每个阶段各有重点，采取突击的方式进行教学；同时按照重点突击和复习巩固相结合的原则，每阶段结束时都进行复习和考试。但是具体的做法，由于各专业学科的特殊情况，在教材分配、教学进度方面，甲乙两组又有不同。根据试验的经验，我们在教材方面，作了进一步的修改，准备在第二次试验时按下面计划进行：甲组要求在二十七天内完成教学工作。第一阶段为十三天（其中第七天和第十二天均作复习考试用，第十三天休息）。第二阶段共七天（其中第六天作复习考试用，第七天休息），第三阶段为七天。第一阶段专门突击文法。第二阶段以突击生字为主、巩固文法为副。第三阶段领导学员进行大量阅读，以培养他们的自学能力。因此，第一阶段的教学时间和辅导时间相等；第二阶段则是辅导多，教课少；第三阶段开始时教课多，辅导少，最后由学员进行自学。到结束时，学员能够懂得基本文法和简单句法，记住生字一千六七百左右，阅读“联共（布）党史简明教程”二十五页到二十八页。乙组的学习时间和甲组同。前后共分四个阶段：第一阶段为十一天（其中上课九天，复习、考试、休息各一天）。第二阶段七天（上课五天，余为复习、考试、休息时间）。第三阶段七天（上课六天，复习一天）。第四阶段二天。第一阶段的中心任务也是突击学习文法（和甲组略有区别）。第二阶段主要是巩固学习文法阶段所得到的成绩，其次是突击生字。第三阶段主要是突击生字。此时教材分为有机化学、无机化学、物理化学三门，力求切合专用，因为只有这样才能结合学员的业务知识，收到更好的学习效果。第四阶段领导学员进行大量阅读，以培养他们的独立阅读的能力。
    速成法的特点
    从两组的试验情形看来，俄文专业书籍阅读速成法有五个特点：
    第一、生词、课文、语法都和业务紧密结合。这就是它的实用性。一般的俄文教材往往和业务相脱节，有些学校的语法教员和读本教员，终年不通声气，因此在教学上谈不到密切配合，效果自然就很差了。而速成教材却完全从实用着眼，课文、生词的编排和各专业的教材密切结合；文法的重点也因各专业学科有所不同。乙组的文法内容，一般地说比甲组要简易。第二、目的性明确。速成法所提出的要求，就是阅读有关业务书籍。所以在教学过程中不像一般教学法那样要求“全面开花”，要求“四会”。教学时教师应该用一切力量提高学员的阅读能力，练习、考试也着重这一方面。第三、速成学习是一种战斗性的学习，生词、课文、语法都是排山倒海而来，内容很多，要完成这个学习任务，必须要求学员以战斗的精神来对待学习。因此我们提出“钻语法是攻堡垒，记生词是抓俘虏”的口号。第四、精力集中、重点突击，这就是  的集中性。在速成学习中学员应该放下其他社会工作或繁琐家务，集中全副精力进行学习。从试验的情形看，凡是在学习期间参加其他工作的，学习效果都不好。所以行政方面应保证学员暂时摆脱其他工作，让他专心学习。其次，速成学习中各个学习阶段的重点要明确。这样才能达到速成的效果。第五、加强思想教育工作。领导方面应该注意从政治上来动员学员和工作人员做好教学工作。在教学中必须和保守思想作斗争，因为速成学习是集体主义的，它和个人主义的教学不同。
    最后必须指出，我们对速成法必须有正确的认识，不能片面地夸大它的作用。因为这种速成法只限于专业书籍的阅读；其次，二十多天的速成学习只能使学员打下能初步阅读俄文专业书籍的基础，决不能说是完成了学习俄文的任务。
