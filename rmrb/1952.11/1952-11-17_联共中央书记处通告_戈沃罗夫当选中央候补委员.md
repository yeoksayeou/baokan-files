    [News from this newspaper] The Pravda newspaper of the Soviet Union published a notice from the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union on October 30th. The original text is as follows:
    Due to the negligence of the Counting Committee of the 19th Party Congress, the name of Comrade L.A. Govorov was omitted from the list of candidate members of the Central Committee elected by the Congress.
    After investigation, it has been confirmed that Comrade L.A. Govorov was indeed elected as a candidate member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.
