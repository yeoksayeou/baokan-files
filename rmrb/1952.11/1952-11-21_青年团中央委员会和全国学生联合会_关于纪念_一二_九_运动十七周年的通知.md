    The "December 9th" Movement, which erupted to oppose imperialist aggression and strive for China's complete independence and freedom, marks its seventeenth anniversary this year. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the "December 9th" Movement set off a high tide of the Chinese people's resistance to Japan and national salvation, became the prelude to the War of Resistance Against Japan, and mobilized and educated the vast number of young people to participate in the armed struggle against Japan and the construction of anti-Japanese democratic base areas, pointing out the correct path for Chinese revolutionary students to integrate with workers, peasants, and soldiers. Now, our great motherland is about to enter a period of large-scale economic construction. It is of great significance to commemorate this glorious festival in this new historical period. Young people and students across the country, especially members of the Communist Youth League, should inherit and carry forward the glorious tradition of patriotism of the "December 9th" Movement, actively participate in the construction of the motherland, study harder, work better, and stand at the forefront of the motherland's construction.
    In order to commemorate this festival, the League organizations and student organizations in secondary and higher cities and secondary and higher schools should strengthen patriotic education among the vast number of young people and students in conjunction with the implementation of the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the Communist Youth League Central Committee. All localities should take appropriate forms to hold commemorations around December 9th. (Xinhua News Agency)

    关于纪念“一二·九”运动十七周年的通知
    为了反对帝国主义侵略、争取中国完全独立自由而爆发的“一二·九”运动，到今年已是十七周年了。在中国共产党的领导下，“一二·九”运动掀起了中国人民抗日救国的高潮，成为抗日战争的序幕，并且发动和教育了广大青年参加抗日的武装斗争和抗日民主根据地的建设，指出了中国革命学生和工农兵结合的正确道路。现在，我们伟大的祖国即将进入大规模经济建设时期，在这个新的历史时期里来纪念这一光辉的节日，是有很大意义的。全国青年和学生，特别是青年团员，要继承和发扬“一二·九”运动的爱国主义的光荣传统，积极地参加祖国的建设事业，要更好地学习，更好地工作，站在祖国建设的前列。
    为了纪念这个节日，中等以上城市、中等以上学校的团组织和学生组织，要结合贯彻青年团三中全会决议的精神，在广大青年和学生中加强爱国主义教育。各地应在十二月九日前后，采取适当形式举行纪念。  （新华社）
