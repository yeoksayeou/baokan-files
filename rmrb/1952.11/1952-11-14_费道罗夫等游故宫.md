The delegates also visited the "Chinese Ancient Art Exhibition Room" in the Palace Museum. They were particularly fond of the "Guo Ji Zi Bai Pan" pottery from the Chinese Warring States period, the famous painting "Real View of Pei Terrace" by the Ming Dynasty painter Tang Bohu, and the large self-ringing clock made in China during the Wanli period of the Ming Dynasty.
