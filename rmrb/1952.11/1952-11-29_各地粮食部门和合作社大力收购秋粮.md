Local grain departments and cooperatives across the country are vigorously carrying out the autumn grain purchase work. Since September, state grain departments and cooperatives have begun purchasing autumn grain in vast rural and urban areas. In September, the national purchase plan was completed by 108% (excluding the Northeast Region and Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region); in October, the purchase plan was completed by 93%.

The growing strength of the state-owned economy and the role of cooperatives as a strong assistant to the state-owned economy in grain purchase are major features of this year's autumn grain purchase work. According to statistics from 25 key markets in the four provinces of Hebei, Pingyuan, Chahar, and Shandong, in early November, the total amount of grain purchased by local grain departments and entrusted cooperatives accounted for 71.5% of the grain on the market. There are a total of 11,358 purchasing points across the country, of which 9,077 are in the major grain-producing areas of North China, Central South China, and East China. Of the more than 11,000 purchasing points nationwide, cooperative purchasing points account for more than 7,800; the proportion of grain purchased by cooperatives generally accounts for 40% to 50% of the grain department's purchases, and this proportion is still increasing. For example, in the Central South region, the proportion was 43% in September, which reached 74% in October, while the proportion in the same period last year was only 6.87%.

This new and powerful state-owned economic force and the purchasing network formed by cooperatives throughout the country have brought about new changes in the original grain market. The characteristic of the change is that the amount of grain on the market in the original large distribution markets has been greatly reduced. The amount of grain on the market in Wuhan, Guangzhou, Changsha, and Nanchang in the third quarter decreased by 60% to 80% compared with the same period last year, while the grain sold by farmers poured into the primary market in large quantities. This not only provides great convenience to farmers but also greatly reduces the possibility of some traders purchasing at low prices in small market towns and then selling at high prices in distribution centers, ensuring that farmers can sell grain at reasonable prices. State-owned grain departments also actively grasp and adjust the price differences between certain regions in accordance with the natural law of commodity circulation, so that private merchants can obtain legitimate profits and engage in grain business. This year, the grain purchased by private merchants in various places generally accounts for about 30% of the amount on the market.

The relationship between local grain departments and cooperatives has become increasingly close in grain purchase. In October, the Ministry of Food of the Central People's Government and the All-China Federation of Cooperatives signed an autumn grain purchase agreement, and similar agreements were also made in various places. In the actual implementation of the business, the cadres of the grain department realized that entrusting cooperatives to purchase grain is the main key to completing the task, so they adopted some specific methods: for example, the Suxian Grain Branch Company in Anhui Province sent people to the local grass-roots cooperatives to help deal with business problems, and the Yiwu County Grain Branch Company and the cooperative jointly organized a grain purchase office. These methods effectively solved the problems in the purchase and enabled the grain purchase task to be completed in a timely manner.

Although the national autumn grain purchase work exceeded the target in September and basically completed the plan in October, the completion situation is extremely unbalanced. Taking October as an example, the Northwest Region did not complete the plan, the Central South Region only completed the rice purchase plan, and the purchase of other autumn grains has not yet been completed, while North China and East China have completed 108% to 121% of the plan. Although grain prices have been basically stable after autumn this year, the phenomenon of disconnection between listed prices and market prices still exists in individual areas, which has a certain impact on the timely completion of the purchase plan. According to statistics from seven markets in Hunan: the average market price is 2.49% higher than the listed price, while the market price in Lingling, Hunan Province, and Fuliang, Jiangxi Province, is 4% to 5% lower than the listed price. The listed prices and market prices in the coarse grain producing areas of North China are also high and low. This is mainly due to the lack of close contact between state-owned grain departments when purchasing in several adjacent areas, and the failure to combine purchase and sale well. In November, the Ministry of Food of the Central People's Government instructed all localities to take measures such as combining large-scale sales with large-scale purchases based on local conditions, in order to match listed prices and market prices and successfully complete the November purchase task.

### 各地粮食部门和合作社大力收购秋粮

    各地粮食部门和合作社大力收购秋粮
    全国各地粮食部门和合作社正大力进行秋粮收购工作。自九月份起，国家粮食部门和合作社就在广大农村和城市开始收购秋粮。九月份全国完成收购计划百分之一百零八（不包括东北区和内蒙古自治区）；十月份完成收购计划百分之九十三。
    国营经济力量的日益壮大，和作为国营经济有力助手的合作社在购粮中起的作用，是今年各地秋粮收购工作的一大特点。据河北、平原、察哈尔、山东四省二十五个重点市场统计，十一月上旬各地粮食部门和委托合作社代购总量占粮食上市量的百分之七十一点五。全国收购点共有一万一千三百五十八个，其中主要粮产区华北、中南、华东区就有收购点九千零七十七个。在全国一万一千多个收购点中合作社代购点占七千八百多个；合作社购粮比重一般占粮食部门收购量百分之四十到五十，目前这种比重还在增加，例如中南区合作社九月份比重为百分之四十三，十月份即达到百分之七十四，而在去年同期的比重，则仅有百分之六点八七。
    这种新的强大的国营经济力量和合作社在全国各地所形成的收购网，就使原有的粮食市场发生了新的变化。变化的特点是原有大集散市场上粮食上市量大大减少，武汉、广州、长沙、南昌第三季度粮食上市量较去年同期减少了百分之六十至八十，而农民出售的粮食则大量涌入初级市场。这样不但给农民极大方便，且大大减少了某些贩运商在小集镇上压价收购后到集散地高价出卖的可能性，保证农民能以合理价格出售粮食。国营粮食部门并按照商品流转的自然规律，主动掌握和调整了某些地区之间的差价，使私商取得合法利润，进行粮食经营。今年各地私商收购的粮食，一般占上市量的百分之三十左右。
    在购粮中各地粮食部门和合作社的关系已日渐密切。十月间中央人民政府粮食部与中华全国合作社联合总社签订了一项秋粮收购协议，各地先后也作了类同的协议。在实际业务执行中，粮食部门的干部认识到委托合作社购粮是完成任务的主要关键，因而采用了一些具体办法：如安徽省宿县粮食支公司派人到该地基层合作社帮助处理业务上的疑难问题，浙江义乌县粮食支公司和合作社共同组织了购粮办公室，这些办法都有效地解决了收购中的问题，使购粮任务能及时完成。
    全国收购秋粮工作，虽在九月份超额完成了任务，十月份基本上完成了计划，但是完成的情况极不平衡。以十月份为例，西北区未完成计划，中南区仅完成稻谷收购计划，而其他秋粮收购尚未完成，华北、华东已完成计划百分之一百零八到百分之一百二十一。今年秋后粮价虽然基本上是稳定的，但在个别地区牌价和市价脱节现象仍然存在，这就使按期完成收购计划受到一定影响。据湖南七个市场统计：平均市价高于牌价百分之二点四九，而湖南省零陵、江西省浮梁市价又低于牌价达百分之四到百分之五，华北粗粮产区牌价、市价也互见高低，这主要是国营粮食部门在几个毗邻地区之间收购时联系不密切，收购和销售不能很好结合所造成的。十一月份中央人民政府粮食部指令各地根据当地具体情况，采取大量销售与大量收购相结合等措施，以求牌价、市价吻合，顺利完成十一月份收购任务。    （新华社）
