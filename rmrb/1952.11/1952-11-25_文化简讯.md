    Inner Mongolia College of Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Medicine Established
    The Inner Mongolia College of Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Medicine held its founding and opening ceremony in Guihua City on November 17. Wang Zaitian, member of the CCP Central Committee's Inner Mongolia-Suiyuan Sub-bureau, Wang Yilun, Deputy Director of the Finance and Economics Committee of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region People's Government, and Hu Zhaoheng, Deputy Director of the Cultural and Education Committee, all attended and spoke. They unanimously pointed out that the establishment of the Inner Mongolia College of Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Medicine demonstrates Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government's boundless concern for the economic and cultural construction of minority areas. They also detailed the significant importance of developing animal husbandry for the country's economic construction. The Inner Mongolia College of Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Medicine was formed by merging the animal husbandry and veterinary medicine departments of the former Pingyuan and Hebei Agricultural Colleges and the veterinary medicine department of the Shanxi Agricultural College. There are currently over one hundred students.

    Introduction to the Contents of "Film Art Data Compendium" No. 5
    The "Film Art Data Compendium" No. 5, compiled by the Art Committee of the Central Film Bureau, has been published. This issue introduces the situation of Soviet science popularization films with a larger number of articles. The article "Several Issues on the Scriptwriting of Science Popularization Films" (by Zhdan) analyzes the techniques, plot, structure, and characters in the scriptwriting of Soviet science popularization films. The article "Science on the Screen" (by Tikhonov) vividly describes the historical development and current situation of the Moscow Science Popularization Film Studio. The article "Experience in Agricultural Propaganda" (by Kuznetsov) points out that the Party has set such a task for the film industry: the agricultural technology films produced should combine the teaching materials of the films with the experience of advanced agricultural producers. This teaching material should be used to promote work methods that have been tested in practice and the actual results of using these methods. The article "Experience in the Production of Agricultural Technology Films" (by Tverdokhlebo) also points out that the task of agricultural technology films is to teach collective farmers new methods of socialist labor, to enable all the people to see the achievements of socialist agriculture, and to scientifically synthesize the rich experience of advanced workers. The article "What Should Educational Films Be Like" (by Arlazorov) talks about the increasing interest of Soviet audiences in educational films year by year. Because film has better performance than other teaching materials, educational films can be greatly promoted.

    This issue also publishes two theoretical articles on performing arts. Adashevsky's "On Reincarnation" explains in detail the significance of the actor's reincarnation of the character in the Stanislavsky system. Koro Jiazhinaya's "Actors and Images" analyzes the reasons for the success and failure of actors' creations, using films such as "Golden Star Hero," "Donbass Miner," and "Shevchenko" as examples.
