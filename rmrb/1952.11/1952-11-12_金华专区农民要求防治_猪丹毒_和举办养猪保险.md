    Farmers in the Jinhua Special District Request Prevention and Treatment of "Swine Erysipelas" and the Establishment of Pig Raising Insurance
    Editor: Pig raising is a major rural sideline occupation in the Jinhua Special District. Jinhua ham is famous throughout the country. Since liberation, pig raising in this special district has developed year by year. According to statistics from the special district's veterinary station: in October 1949, there were 228,221 pigs in the entire special district; in 1951, this increased to 618,143; and in 1952, it further increased to 757,933, an increase of more than 232 percent compared to before liberation.
    However, the pig raising industry in the Jinhua Special District is currently facing a serious problem, which is the problem of "swine erysipelas."
    According to statistics, this year alone, 54,266 pigs in the entire special district have died from "swine erysipelas." In Yiwu County alone, more than 10,000 pigs weighing over 100 jin have died.
    The main reasons for the prevalence of "swine erysipelas" are: (1) there is no strict prohibition on slaughtering and selling diseased and dead pigs; (2) there is a lack of veterinary personnel and medical equipment, resulting in the rapid spread of the epidemic and the inability to prevent it. At present, the party and government leadership departments at the special district and subordinate county levels in Jinhua have attached importance to this issue and have universally carried out publicity on epidemic prevention and hygiene, as well as prohibiting the slaughter and sale of dead pigs, but it cannot completely stop the development of the epidemic. In order to eliminate "swine erysipelas" and continue to develop pig raising as a sideline, the farmers here request: (1) that more veterinary personnel be sent to the epidemic areas to treat pig diseases and administer preventive injections; (2) that the People's Insurance Company establish pig raising insurance to reduce the losses of affected households.
    I think these opinions are worth considering and adopting by the relevant departments.

### 金华专区农民要求防治“猪丹毒”和举办养猪保险

    金华专区农民要求防治“猪丹毒”和举办养猪保险
    编辑同志：养猪是金华专区主要的农村副业，金华火腿是全国著名的。解放后，这个专区养猪业逐年发展。据专区的兽医站统计：一九四九年十月全专区有猪二十二万八千二百二十一只，一九五一年增至六十一万八千一百四十三只，一九五二年更增至七十五万七千九百三十三只，较解放前增加百分之二百三十二强。
    但目前金华专区的养猪业却面临着一个严重的问题，就是“猪丹毒”的问题。
    据统计，今年全专区因患“猪丹毒”死去的毛猪，已达五万四千二百六十六只。义乌县一县就死去一百斤以上的毛猪一万只以上。
    “猪丹毒”流行的主要原因是：（一）没有严格禁止宰食及出售患病的死猪；（二）缺乏兽医人员和药械，以致病疫流传迅速，无法防止。目前金华专区及所属县区级党政领导部门已经重视了这个问题，普遍开展了防疫卫生及禁止宰食和出售死猪的宣传，但还不能完全制止疫病的发展。这里的农民为了扑灭“猪丹毒”，继续发展养猪副业，都要求：（一）有更多的兽医人员到疫区治疗猪病和注射预防针；（二）要求人民保险公司举办养猪保险，减轻受灾户的损失。
    我认为这些意见是值得有关部门考虑采纳的。
    周谊
