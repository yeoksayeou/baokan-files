    Hunan Launches Winter Pest Control Campaign
    Hunan Province is launching a large-scale winter pest control campaign. Farmers throughout the province are mobilizing to dig up and destroy rice stubble (i.e., rice roots) and remove weeds from field ridges. In Shaoyang Prefecture alone, incomplete statistics show that rice stubble has been dug up from more than 2.4 million mu of paddy fields.
    This year, Hunan Province's rice loss due to pests accounted for about 6% of the total output. To further eliminate pests and strive for a bumper harvest next year, the Hunan Provincial People's Government recently issued an implementation outline for winter pest control (mainly targeting rice borers), requiring the entire province to leave no paddy fields or rice stubble for rice borers to overwinter.

    湖南展开冬季治虫运动
    湖南省正展开大规模的冬季治虫运动。全省农民纷纷动员起来，挖毁禾蔸（即稻根），铲除田塍杂草。仅邵阳专区的不完全统计，已挖毁二百四十多万亩稻田中的禾蔸。
    今年湖南全省因虫害损失的稻谷约占总产量百分之六。为进一步消灭虫害，争取明年丰收，湖南省人民政府最近颁发了冬季治虫（以螟虫为主）实施纲要，要求全省不留一丘板田和一个禾蔸给螟虫过冬。
