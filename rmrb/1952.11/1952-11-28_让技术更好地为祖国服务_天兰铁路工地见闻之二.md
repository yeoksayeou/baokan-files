    Let Technology Better Serve the Motherland
    -- Observations from the Tianlan Railway Construction Site, Part 2
    By Our Correspondent Lù Hào
    During my stay at the No. 41 tunnel construction site of the Tianlan Railway, I heard engineers talking more than once about how they relied on the workers to conquer this largest tunnel in Guannei, stretching several miles.
    The No. 41 tunnel project started in June 1951. According to the original plan for the Tianlan Railway to open to traffic in June 1953, the No. 41 tunnel had to be completed in March of the same year. However, due to the hard soil of the tunnel, it only progressed five "cun" (approximately 1.6 inches) per day at the beginning. Later it gradually increased to one meter (approximately 3.3 feet), but then the speed of progress could not be further improved.
    If it continued like this, the tunnel would not be completed by June 1953, and the scheduled opening of traffic could not be achieved. This problem caused anxiety among all employees. Some engineering technicians said: "It has always been like this, there is no other way." But the captain of this engineering team, Zhāng Zhènshēng, was an engineer, and he and the associate Yáng Zémín and others knew how to rely on the workers. They said: "Then we can only mobilize the workers and ask everyone to find solutions together."
    At that time, the pilot tunnel project involved two people holding a drill and two people hammering. Four people worked in a hole of about two meters (approximately 6.6 feet) up and down, left and right. The team leadership's call for everyone to find solutions sparked widespread discussion among the workers. Workers Mǎ Wànlín, Lú Zhìpíng and others thought that now four people were working in such a small space, afraid of bumping into each other, hindering each other. Therefore, it would be better to reduce it to two people working, shorten the handles of the drill and hammer, and take the drill and hammer themselves. Zhāng Zhènshēng and others immediately accepted this method. The results of the experiment proved that although the number of people was reduced, they could fully exert their strength, and the work efficiency was improved instead.
    Zhāng Zhènshēng, Yáng Zémín, and other comrades understood from their actual work that when they encountered difficulties, they should go to the workers and tell them all the difficulties encountered in the project. They regarded the workers as their best friends. Based on the single-person drilling method of Mǎ Wànlín, Lú Zhìpíng and others, the workers continued to come up with a two-layer, three-section method. This working method turned the pilot tunnel project, which originally only had two drills working, into five drills progressing simultaneously. This made the work progress reach three meters (approximately 9.8 feet) per day. Compared with the beginning, it had been increased by two times.
    In October 1951, Wáng Shìtài, the director of the Northwest Railway Trunk Line Engineering Bureau, and other comrades arrived at the tunnel construction site. After their investigation and research, and calculation of the construction period, they believed that the No. 41 tunnel could be completed ahead of schedule, and the Tianlan Railway could also be opened to traffic in Lanzhou ahead of schedule by the end of 1952.
    The news of opening the traffic to Lanzhou ahead of schedule spread throughout the construction site, shocking the engineering technicians. Because according to the plan to open the traffic to Lanzhou ahead of schedule by the end of 1952, the No. 41 tunnel project had to be completed eight months ahead of the original plan.
    Some said: "How is this possible, it's a bit like joking."
    Some shook their heads after hearing it: "Only two hundred meters (approximately 656 feet) have been dug in, and who knows what's inside. It's definitely not going to be completed, definitely not going to be completed."
    Some said: "Whether it can be completed or not, let's wait and see."
    Seeing this situation, Zhāng Zhènshēng and others realized that it would be difficult to pass this issue among the engineering technicians first. So he decided to go to the masses of workers to find solutions first. He first told the cadres of the company and the teams about this matter. Although some of them also shook their heads at the beginning, they thought about it later and unanimously said: "It's possible, let's do it." Seeing that the worker cadres all agreed, Zhāng Zhènshēng and others felt that they already had 70% or 80% certainty about the matter. Zhāng Zhènshēng thought to himself: This time, let the workers lead our engineering technicians.
    Because Zhāng Zhènshēng and others concentrated the advantages of the two-layer, three-section method, which can accommodate more people and eliminate any gaps in the work, during the excavation, widening, and lining of the tunnel, the progress of the work was greatly improved. By March and April of 1952, the progress of the pilot tunnel at the east entrance of No. 41 tunnel had reached 8.37 meters (approximately 27.5 feet). It seemed that completing the project on schedule was no longer a problem.
    The fact is like this. An engineer, if he can not only handle affairs based on the knowledge he learned in books, but also listen to the opinions of the masses of workers based on the specific situation, this can greatly advance engineering technology; otherwise, he will definitely fail.
    Wáng Zhàoxīn, the engineer in charge of the No. 40 tunnel project on the Tianlan Railway, had a painful lesson because he was divorced from the workers, which caused great difficulties for the project.
    The process of excavating the No. 40 tunnel was a heroic and arduous struggle. The tunnel was full of flowing water and mud. The water pump had to pump more than 80 tons of water out of the cave every day. The water sometimes flowed over the heads, feet, and surroundings of the workers. The people working in the cave were covered in mud, and only their eyes could be seen moving. Some even had their eyes covered. They walked out of the cave, wiped the mud off their eyes, and came back to continue working. The mud on the ground was even deeper. The legs trapped in the mud had to be held by another person to be pulled out.
    When the tunnel entered more than 90 meters (approximately 295 feet), the speed of progress was four meters (approximately 13 feet) per day. In order to rush the work forward, engineer Wáng Zhàoxīn only pursued his own wishes and did not consider the actual situation facing the project. He asked the workers to fold down the supporting pillars to brush the sides.
    At this time, dangerous signs had already appeared in the tunnel. Variegated soil layers mixed with water turned the pilot tunnel into a world of mud. The mutual congestion of the mud made the pressure in the cave greater and greater. Some of the supporting pillars had already arched, and the bulging mud next to the pillars had wrapped the pillars.
    Experienced workers, under this circumstance, often only need to tap the pillars with an axe and listen to the sound to know how much pressure the pillars have already taken on. At that time, the workers said: "We can't go forward like this anymore." They felt that the current pressure on the pillars was already very high, and they should not advance four meters (approximately 13 feet) as in the past, but should advance two meters (approximately 6.6 feet), or even less, and take a steady approach. Only by steady progress can we reduce and overcome various difficulties and smoothly complete the entire tunnel project of pilot tunnel, side brushing, and lining. If we continue to rush forward as in the past, there is a danger of the roof collapsing.
    But Wáng Zhàoxīn's opinion was not like this. He said, "We are in charge of the plan, you just do the work, don't worry about anything else."
    "You are the engineer, we are the workers." The workers said: "Can't you listen to our opinions?"
    Not only did Wáng Zhàoxīn not listen, but he also flew into a rage. He said, "Whether you agree or not, I tell you to do it, and you have to do it."
    The workers could not fold down any more pillars after folding down eight pillars in a row. The workers all said: "We can't fold them down anymore, it will be dangerous if we fold them down again."
    Wáng Zhàoxīn said stubbornly: "You are timid! You are afraid of death!"
    The logs could no longer be folded down by ordinary methods. The workers cut the logs with axes, and the logs were cut off. However, at this time, at 90 meters (approximately 295 feet), a piece of ground on the top of the mountain that was more than ten meters (approximately 33 feet) to twenty meters (approximately 66 feet) wide had sunk deeper and deeper. The entire sink had gone down more than one meter (approximately 3.3 feet) deep.
    The sinking of the ground on the top of the mountain caused the top of the tunnel to move. After the supports in the tunnel were subjected to greater pressure, they creaked everywhere, and some of them had already cracked and twisted into several sections. Some logs that were three or four "cun" (approximately 1-1.3 inches) thick were also crushed.
    Due to Wáng Zhàoxīn's negligence, the No. 40 tunnel project fell into an even more difficult situation. Sometimes the progress of the tunnel project could only be advanced a few "cun" (approximately 1.6 inches) per day with difficulty; sometimes, two cubic meters of thin mud were dug out every day, but one and a half cubic meters collapsed. In the end, following the opinions of the masses of workers, the speed of the project was slowed down, and steady progress was made, gradually overcoming numerous difficulties, and steadily completing the tunnel project, allowing the train to drive over from the huge mountain cave.
    Facts are the best education for technical personnel.
    The engineer Shěn Qǐyìn, whom I met in the First Engineering Team, told me that in July last year, someone from the bureau came and asked his work unit to complete 600 meters (approximately 1969 feet) of lining in 1951, which was about twice as high as the original plan. After hearing this, he thought to himself: This is making things difficult for the subordinates, it's impossible, it's nonsense. He saw that the workers were very enthusiastic, and he said to himself: "The enthusiasm is very high, but enthusiasm alone cannot open the mountain cave."
    According to Shěn Qǐyìn's view, in old China, the lining of the tunnel was only five "cun" (approximately 1.6 inches) per day. When the No. 41 tunnel began lining, the progress was also five "cun" (approximately 1.6 inches) per day, which seemed reasonable to him. But after August, the progress reached two meters (approximately 6.6 feet) per day, which greatly shocked him. One day, Shěn Qǐyìn went to the cave and deliberately asked the squad leader Zhū Jǐng: "Can it be further improved?" Zhū Jǐng replied with full confidence: "Yes." A few days later, the workers discussed shortening the time for transporting concrete and improving the tools, and the daily progress reached six meters (approximately 20 feet). This incident gave Shěn Qǐyìn's thinking a great shock. He saw that many things on the project were obviously impossible, but the workers did them one by one. He felt that it was really unreasonable to be so aloof, to think that only he was the one who used his brains and had knowledge; and that the workers were the ones who used their strength and had no knowledge.
    When Shěn Qǐyìn felt that his work was very inconsistent with the labor enthusiasm of the masses of workers, this gradually shortened the distance between him and the workers. He said: "When I started to feel this, I slowly became willing to get closer to the worker comrades. When I stand with them, I have an unusually warm feeling."
    Shěn Qǐyìn, who used to only sit in the office and rarely went to the site, now feels uneasy when it rains. Sometimes, the rain has not stopped and it is already dark, but he still runs to the site to see if the materials have been washed away and the foundation has been damaged. Once, I heard that a pontoon bridge had been washed away, and Shěn Qǐyìn could not be found everywhere. People rushed to the scene, but he had actually arrived there long ago.
    An engineer, when he truly understands how to rely on the workers, he can get endless assistance from his technology, and his technology can see a broader world. He will no longer be self-enclosed, and he will no longer think that he is great, and others will find him ridiculous. (Attached picture)

    让技术更好地为祖国服务
    ——天兰铁路工地见闻之二
    本报记者  陆灏
    我在天兰铁路第四十一号隧道工地停留的时候，我听到工程师们不止一次地谈论过他们如何依靠了工人，征服了这座长达数华里的关内最大隧道。
    四十一号隧道工程是在一九五一年六月开工的。如果按照原来天兰铁路于一九五三年六月通车的计划，第四十一号隧道的工程必须要在同年三月份完成。但由于隧道的土质坚硬，开始每天前进不过五公寸，后来逐渐提高到一公尺，以后，前进的速度便再也无法提高。
    要是像这样进行，一九五三年六月隧道还打不通，按期通车就无法完成。这问题引起了全体职工的焦虑，有的工程技术人员说：“历来都是这样的，除此以外，别无办法。”但负责这个工程队的队长张振声是位工程师，他和协理员杨泽民等懂得依靠工人，他们说：那只有发动工人，大家共同想办法。
    当时导坑工程是两人拿钎，两人打锤，四个人在一个上下、左右约二公尺的窟窿里进行工作。队部要大家想办法的号召在工人中引起了广泛地讨论，工人马万林、卢治平等，他们想到现在是四个人在那样小的地方工作，你怕碰我，我怕撞你，彼此妨碍。这样，还不如减少到两个人工作，把钎和锤的柄减短，自己拿钎，自己打锤。张振声等立即接受了这个办法，试验的结果，证明人虽减少了，但却能充分发挥自己的力量，而工率反而提高了。
    张振声和杨泽民等同志，他们从实际工作中懂得当遇到困难的时候，他们就到工人中去，把工程上遇到的困难全部告诉给工人。把工人看作是自己最好的朋友。在马万林、卢治平等的单人打钎法的基础上，工人们又继续想出了两层三节的办法。这种工作方法，使本来只有两把钎子工作的导坑工程，变成五把钎子同时并进了。这样就使工作的进度每天达到三公尺。和开始时候相比，已经提高了两倍。
    一九五一年十月份，西北铁路干线工程局局长王世泰等同志到了隧道的工地，经过他们的调查研究，计算工期，认为第四十一号隧道还可以提前完成，天兰铁路也能在一九五二年年底提前通车兰州。
    要提前通车到兰州的消息传遍了工地，使工程技术人员大为震惊。因为要按照在一九五二年年底提前通车兰州的计划，四十一号隧道的工程就必须比原计划提前八个月完成。
    有的说：“这怎么可能，有点像开玩笑。”
    有的是听了就摇摇头：“才进去二百多公尺，里头还不知道有什么玩意儿，肯定的说，一定完不成，一定完不成。”
    有的说：“完得成，完不成，看看再说。”
    张振声等眼看这种情况，想要先在工程技术人员中间通过这个问题，是很困难的。于是他就决心先到工人群众中去想办法。他先把这件事情告诉中队和小队的干部们，他们中间开始虽然也有摇脑袋的，但他们后来想了一想，都一致表示说：“可以的，干一下吧。”看到工人干部们都同意了，张振声等就觉得事情已经有了七、八十分把握，张振声自己想：这一次，让工人们来带动我们的工程技术人员吧。
    由于张振声等在隧道的挖底、扩大、衬砌的过程中，都集中了两层三节法的能多容纳人和消灭工作当中任何空隙的优点，工作的进度大为提高。到了一九五二年的三、四月份，四十一号隧道东口导坑的进度已经达到八·三七公尺。工程按期完成眼看已不成什么问题。
    事实就是如此。一个工程师，如果他不仅能够根据在书本上学到的知识办事，而且还能根据具体情况，听取工人群众的意见办事，这就能大大地使工程技术前进一步；不如此，就一定失败。
    负责天兰铁路上第四十号隧道工程的工程师王肇欣，他就有过因为脱离工人，致使工程造成巨大困难的痛苦教训。
    开凿第四十号隧道的过程是一场英勇和艰苦的斗争。隧道里到处是流水和泥浆，抽水机每天要从洞里抽出八十多吨水，水有时从工人的头上、脚下四周淌过。在洞内工作的人全身都为泥浆粘满，只能看到两只眼睛在转动，有的甚至眼睛也被糊住了。他们走出洞外，擦掉了眼睛上的泥浆，又回来继续工作，地上的泥浆更深了，陷在泥浆里的腿，要另外一个人扶着才能拔出来。
    当隧道进入九十多公尺的时候，工程前进的速度是每天四公尺。工程师王肇欣为了要向前赶工，他只追求自己的愿望，不考虑工程面临的实际情况。他让工人们折去支撑的柱子刷帮。
    在这个时候，隧道内已经出现了危险的征象。杂色土层掺着水，使导坑变成一个泥浆的世界。泥浆的相互拥塞使洞内的压力越来越大，支撑的柱子有的已经弓了起来，柱子旁边鼓着的泥浆有的把柱子都裹住了。
    有经验的工人，在这种情况下，往往只要用斧头敲敲柱子，听听声音，就会知道柱子上已经担负了多大压力。当时，工人们说：“我们不能再像这样前进了。”他们觉得目前柱子的压力已经很大，不能再像过去那样前进四公尺，应该前进二公尺，或者更少一些，采取稳扎稳打的办法。只有稳扎稳打，才能减轻和克服各种困难，顺利完成导坑、刷帮、衬砌的全部隧道工程。如果再像过去那样猛进，洞顶有沉陷的危险。
    但王肇欣的意见不是这样。他说，“我们是掌握计划的，你们只管做工，不要管别的。”
    “你是工程师，我们是工人。”工人们说：“我们的意见，你不能听听吗？”
    王肇欣非但不听，而且大发雷霆，他说：“不管你们同意不同意，我叫你们做，你们就要做。”
    工人们一连折了八根柱子就折不动了，工人们都说：“不能折了，再折就有危险了。”
    王肇欣蛮横的说：“你们胆小！你们怕死！”
    元木已经不能再用一般的办法折去，工人们用斧子砍元木，元木是砍断了。但是，这时候在九十公尺的地方，山顶上有一块十几公尺到二十几公尺宽的地面已经越陷越深整个陷下来有一公尺多深。
    山顶的地面向下沉陷，就使隧道的顶部动起来。在隧道的支撑受到了更大的压力以后，到处压得咯吱咯吱发响，有的则已经呲牙裂嘴，湾湾扭扭的折成几段。有的三、四公寸粗的元木也被压酥了。
    由于王肇欣的疏忽，四十号隧道工程就陷于更为艰难的境地。隧道工程的进展有时候每天艰难地只能前进数公寸；有时候，每天挖两方稀泥，但坍下来的倒有一方半。结果还是依着工人群众的意见，放慢了工程的前进速度，稳扎稳打，才逐步克服了重重困难，稳当地完成了隧道工程，让火车从巨大的山峒中开过来。
    事实对于技术人员是最好的教育。
    我在第一工程队认识的工程师沈启印，他告诉我在去年七月的时候，局里来人要求他的工作单位能在一九五一年内完成六百公尺衬砌，比原计划高出约一倍。他听了以后，心里想：这是让下级为难哩，根本办不到的事，是瞎说。他看见工人们的热情很高，他暗暗说：“热情是很高，但光凭热情不能打通山峒呀。”
    按沈启印的看法，在旧中国，隧道的衬砌每天只是五公寸，四十一号隧道开始衬砌的时候，每天的进度也是五公寸，这在他看来像是合理的。但到了八月以后，每天的进度到了两公尺，这已经使他大为震惊。有一天，沈启印到峒里去，故意问小队长朱璟：“是否还能再提高？”朱璟充满了信心回答说：“可以。”不几天，工人们商量了缩短运送混凝土的时间，改良了工具，每天进度就达到了六公尺。这件事给沈启印的思想以极大的震动，他看到很多工程上明明办不到的事，但工人们却一件一件都办到了。他觉得自己再要那样清高，再以为只有自己是劳心的，是有智识的；工人是劳力的，是没有知识的，这实在太没有道理了。
    当沈启印感到自己的工作和工人群众的劳动热情十分不相称的时候，这就开始逐渐缩短了他和工人之间的距离。他说：“开始感到这一点，我就慢慢愿和工人同志们靠近了，当我和他们站在一起的时候，我有一种异常温暖的感觉。”
    过去只坐在办公室，不大到现场去的沈启印，现在是看见天一下雨，他的心就不安宁了。有时候，雨还没有停，天已经黑了，他还往现场上跑，看看材料有没有被冲走，基础冲坏了没有。有一次，听说有一座便桥被水冲了，到处找不到沈启印，人们赶到现场，他其实已经早到那里了。
    一个工程师，当他真正懂得依靠工人的时候，他就能使自己的技术得到无尽的援助，使自己的技术见到了更广阔的天地，他就不会再故步自封，不会再自己觉得了不起，别人看他很可笑了。（附图片）
