To the Editor: On the occasion of the 35th anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution, I would like to express my gratitude to the Soviet people and my determination to learn from advanced Soviet experience.

I am a farmer who has grown cotton for many years. I deeply feel that the Soviet big brother selflessly teaches us advanced production experience and science and technology, which has been of great help to me in growing cotton. Take two facts as examples! Last year, after the comrades from Yuncheng Farm introduced me to the advanced Soviet experience of close planting of cotton, I finally found the knack for high yield. After I promoted it in the village this year, the experience of close planting spread. In the past, my village kept 2,000 seedlings per mu of cotton field, but this year it generally increased to more than 3,000 seedlings, and comprehensive technical improvements were implemented. As a result, the 520 mu of cotton fields in the Quzhuangtou natural village yielded an average of more than 453 jin of seed cotton per mu, which is more than 158 jin more than last year. Soviet agricultural expert Comrade Lysenko also introduced me to watering experience. Although I knew earlier that cotton seedlings should "not grow too fast and should not be droughty," I didn't understand why. After Comrade Lysenko explained it, I understood it in my heart that "frequent irrigation with small amounts" not only saves water, but also keeps the soil and air constantly moist; especially during the period from cotton seedling flowering to boll formation, when cotton juice is the most abundant and requires the most moisture, the benefits of frequent irrigation with small amounts are even greater. I accepted the technical guidance of this Soviet friend, and the number of irrigations was more than in the past, while the amount of irrigation was less than in the past. This is also one of the reasons for guaranteeing my cotton's high yield. In addition, I have learned from magazines about the Soviet big brother's pruning, branching, and applying fertilizer in stages, and other technologies, which have been of great help to me in improving production.

In the future, in order to further strengthen the profound friendship and unity between the people of China and the Soviet Union, and to thank the Soviet big brother for his guidance and help, I guarantee that all members of our mutual aid group will study the advanced production experience and science and technology of the Soviet Union collectively once a week in conjunction with reading the newspaper, and I guarantee that we will promote the learning experience and research experience to the outside world at any time.

    全国植棉丰产模范曲耀离
    决心学习苏联先进生产经验
    编辑同志：在伟大的十月社会主义革命三十五周年纪念日的时候，我来讲讲我感谢苏联人民的心意和学习苏联先进经验的决心。
    我是个种了多年棉花的农民。我深深感到苏联老大哥毫无私心地把先进生产经验和科学技术教给我们，对我种棉的帮助太大了。就拿两件事实来说吧！去年运城农场同志介绍我学会苏联棉花密植的先进经验后，我才摸到了丰产的窍门。今年开春后，我在村上一宣传，密植经验便推广开了。过去我村每亩棉田留两千株苗，今年普遍增加到三千株以上，并实行了全面改进技术，结果，我们曲庄头自然村水地棉花五百二十亩，每亩平均收籽棉四百五十三斤多，比去年多一百五十八斤。苏联农业专家卢森科同志还向我介绍了浇水经验。早先我虽知道棉苗是“不宜猛长不宜旱”，但却不懂得为什么。经卢森科同志一解释，我心眼里才透亮了，知道了“勤灌少灌”不光能节省用水，而且能使土壤及空气经常保持水分；特别是在棉苗开花到结桃这一期间，棉花汁液最多，最需要水分，勤灌少灌的好处更大。我接受了这位苏联友人的技术指导，浇水遍数比过去多，而浇水量比过去少了。这也是保证我的棉花丰产的原因之一。此外，我又从杂志上学习了苏联老大哥的整枝打杈、分期施肥以及施肥等技术，这些对我提高生产都有很大的帮助。
    今后，为了进一步加强中苏两国人民的深厚友谊与团结，并答谢苏联老大哥对我的指导和帮助，我保证我们互助组全体组员，每星期结合读报集体学习一次苏联的先进生产经验与科学技术，并保证把学习的心得及研究的经验随时向外推广。
