    Learning from Outstanding Soviet Film Playwrights
    Yu Min
    On November 6th, we welcomed seven envoys from the Soviet film industry. They are all excellent teachers and close friends whom we have never met. From the screen, from their works, we have long received their immeasurable instruction.
    The labor and struggle of the Soviet people illuminate the path forward for our people. The brilliant achievements of Soviet film artists have set an example for our film workers. Their work experience has already given us a lot of help and inspiration.
    Maria Smirnova is one of the seven representatives, and she is the screenwriter of the famous films "The Village Teacher" and "The Rural Doctor." "The Village Teacher" was screened in our country long ago. The ordinary yet great life of the female teacher Martenova deeply moved us. In old Russia, she was a little-respected elementary school teacher in a remote Siberian village, but in socialist Soviet Union, she became a true hero. The state and the people gave her the honor she deserved. This is a dignified image, a typical example of excellent educators. Zhdanov said: "Our literature, reflecting a system higher than any bourgeois democracy, a culture many times higher than bourgeois culture, has the right to teach others with a new, all-human moral." "The Village Teacher" meets this requirement.
    Recently, we also watched Smirnova's new work, "The Rural Doctor." This work gave us great pleasure. Ordinary people, ordinary things, but the theme is profound. The author uses extremely meticulous brushstrokes to depict the hard work and selfless labor of medical workers. The commonalities and differences in the personalities of the 76-year-old hospital director Arsenyev and the young female doctor Korshakova are vividly expressed. In Smirnova's new work, the atmosphere of life is compellingly real, and life and art are integrated here.
    The above two are the only works of Smirnova that we have seen. Even with just these two, we can already appreciate the author's creative characteristics. She has an insight into the essence of life, delves into the inner world of people, discovers dramatic conflicts from ordinary things, and expresses them with perfect artistic form. She sees noble virtues in ordinary people and extracts poetry from everyday life. The author uses true poetry to praise true people—those who are selfless, noble, and pure. The Soviet society, which has eliminated all exploitation and realized humanity's most beautiful ideals, is bound to cultivate a new type of person. They love labor, dedicate everything to the motherland and the people, build socialist and communist society with selfless work, and extend a moral hand to all people who love freedom and peace. The creation of the two images of Martenova and Korshakova proves that the author knows such people very well, is not only familiar with their words and smiles, but also understands the richness of their inner world. If a person cares about everyone, the welfare of the collective, and the destiny of the motherland and mankind, how can he not be the most thoughtful and emotional person? Naturally, understanding such a person is one thing, but embodying him or her in artistic creation is another. To achieve the latter, one must also have solid labor and the skills of a true poet. Before and after the screening of "The Village Teacher," we read a short essay by the female writer, in which she told us how she wrote this script. She talked about visiting various schools, listening to classes, and talking with teachers and students, like the Ural miners in a crystal mine, seeing the purity and beauty of the stones. This is the tense labor of creation, but that is not enough. Deep sensibility enables the author to discover great themes from ordinary people. The female teacher she visited said with great confidence, "Children's education must be based on complete truth, goodness, and beauty." So the author wrote: "As she spoke, the concept of a future hero was forming in my heart. The key to my problem has been found."
    Life is like the sea, sometimes with turbulent waves, sometimes seemingly calm and waveless. The life of a village teacher or village doctor seems unremarkable: class, dismissal, seeing patients, prescribing medicine, day after day, just like that. In "The Village Teacher" and "The Rural Doctor," these daily labors are so poetic and charming because the author has discovered the lofty purpose and the best qualities of people in them, and expresses them through artistic images. At a recent symposium, the female writer said, "What moves her is that these characters have an indomitable strength. Some teachers spend years or decades teaching students to brush their teeth and wash their hands every day." To make people better, to make the motherland better, any small labor becomes part of a brilliant career. The author loves such characters, and her work naturally becomes a hymn to them.
    The characters under Smirnova's pen are not static but gradually developing and improving. She is not afraid to touch on some weaknesses of the protagonist. Martenova and Korshakova both have weaknesses. Once these weaknesses are overcome, the protagonist takes a step forward. The author creates her ideal personality on the basis of the real advantages and disadvantages of people. The author never speculates out of thin air. The authenticity of the characters is the source of the work's powerful appeal.
    The female writer is good at interweaving the improvement of people with the development of the country and society. In Smirnova's works, the evolution of events not only provides a vast background for the characters in the play, but also determines the fate of the protagonists and plays a major role in them. For example, the protagonist of "The Village Teacher" has experienced many historical events in her life. Each event has a certain impact on her and pushes her to a new and higher stage. In order to portray character and psychology on a huge canvas, the author combines the elements of narrative poetry and lyrical poetry. The classroom Q&A between the female teacher and the student who became a doctor, and the late-night conversation between the female doctor and the old director, are so tightly gripping because the author has brought us to a poetic realm.
    Smirnova is extremely serious about creative work. At the symposium, she said: "After 'The Village Teacher' was written, all aspects gave it a high evaluation. I calmly looked at my script and felt that there were still many places that needed to be revised." She also said, "After the script is written, one should keep a certain distance to look at one's own work, and even let it go for a period of time, so that one can be more objective. Only in this way can one discover the shortcomings of one's own work and accept the criticism of others." There is no doubt that an author who maintains such a clear mind will naturally move forward non-stop and endlessly.
    Smirnova's strengths are worth learning from by our country's film playwrights. We are not good at discerning the new qualities of working people, and we are not good at grasping their character traits. We often cannot discover amazing events from daily life, and we often cannot reveal the deep contradictions of society from inconspicuous places. In short, our achievements are extremely disproportionate to the demands of the people. In order to change this situation, we must quickly turn the strengths of Soviet film playwrights into our own strengths. In addition to intensifying our study of Marxism-Leninism and learning about society, we must also strengthen our study of Soviet literature and film. We have already studied Soviet films and excellent Soviet film literature, and we have paid great attention to it, but our learning lacks systematicness and organization. We should improve this aspect.

    向杰出的苏联电影剧作家学习
    于敏
    十一月六日，我们迎来了七位苏联电影界的使者。他们都是我们从未晤面过的良师密友。从银幕上，从他们的作品中，我们早已得到他们的无法估量的教益了。
    苏联人民的劳动和斗争照亮了我国人民前进的道路。苏联电影艺术家的辉煌的工作成果，为我国电影工作者树立了榜样。他们的工作经验已经给了我们很多帮助，很多启示。
    玛利亚·斯米尔诺娃是七位代表中的一个，她是名片“乡村女教师”和“乡村医生”的剧作者。“乡村女教师”早在我国放映过了。女教师玛尔腾诺娃的平凡而伟大的一生深深感动了我们。她在旧俄是一个不被人尊重的西伯利亚荒村的小学教师，但在社会主义的苏联，她却成了真正的英雄。国家和人民给了她应得的荣誉。这是一个庄严的形象，是优秀的教育工作者的典型。日丹诺夫说：“我们的文学既是反映着一种比任何资产阶级民主制度更高的制度，一种比资产阶级文化更高许多倍的文化，它就有权利用一种新的全人类意义的道德教导别人。”“乡村女教师”是符合这个要求的。
    最近，我们又看了斯米尔诺娃的新作“乡村医生”。这个作品给我们很大的愉快。平凡的人，平凡的事，但主题是深刻的。作者用极细致的笔触描画了医务工作者辛勤的工作和忘我的劳动。七十六岁的医院院长阿尔先耶夫和年青的女医生柯沙阔娃在性格上的共同点和差异点都获得了鲜明的表现。在斯米尔诺娃的这一新作中，生活气氛是逼人的真实，生活和艺术在这里融为一体了。
    斯米尔诺娃的作品，我们看到的还只有以上两部。即使仅仅两部，我们已经可以领略到作者的创作特色。她洞察生活的底蕴，深入人的内心世界，从平凡事物中发现戏剧性的冲突，并用完美的艺术形式表现出来。她从普通人身上看出崇高的美德，从日常生活中提炼出诗。作者是用真正的诗，歌颂真正的人——那种毫无自私自利之心的，崇高的纯粹的人。消灭了一切剥削，实现了人类最美好理想的苏联社会，必然陶冶出新型的人。他们热爱劳动，把一切献给祖国和人民，用忘我的工作在建设社会主义、共产主义社会，并向一切爱好自由和平的人民伸出道义的手。玛尔腾诺娃和柯沙阔娃两个形象的创造，证明作者十分懂得这样的人，不但熟悉他们的言谈笑貌，而且了解他们内心世界的丰富。人如果关心的是大家，是集体的福利，是祖国和人类的命运，他怎能不是最有思想最富感情的人？自然，懂得这种人，是一回事，而在艺术创作中把他形象化，则是另一回事。要做到后一点，还须切实的劳动和真正诗人的技巧。“乡村女教师”放映前后，我们读到女作家一篇短文，其中告诉了我们她怎样写了这一剧本。她说到参观各个学校，听课，和师生谈话，好像乌拉尔的矿工在水晶矿里一样，看到一块块石头的纯净和美丽。这是创造的紧张劳动，但这还不够。深刻的感受力使作者从平凡人物身上发现了伟大的主题。她所访问的那位女教师很有自信地说：“儿童教育必须基于完全的真善美”，于是作者写道：“当她讲话时，我心里在形成一个未来英雄的概念。我的问题的关键，已经找到了。”
    生活像海一样，有时波浪汹涌，有时似乎平静无波。乡村教师，乡村医生，他们的生活似乎是平淡无奇的，上课，下课，看病，开药，日复一日，不过如此。在“乡村女教师”和“乡村医生”中，这些日常劳动之所以富有诗意和色彩迷人，是由于作者从其中发现了崇高的目的和人的最优良的品质，并通过艺术形象把它表现出来。在最近一次座谈会上，女作家说“使她感动的是这些人物有一种坚强不屈的力量，有的教师在几年几十年中每天教学生刷牙洗手。”要把人变得美好起来，要把祖国变得美好起来，任何微小的劳动都成为光辉事业的一部份。作者热爱这样的人物，她的作品自然就成为他们的颂歌。
    斯米尔诺娃笔下的人物不是静止不变而是日渐发展和提高的。她不怕触到主人公的某些弱点。玛尔腾浩娃和柯沙阔娃都是有弱点的。这些弱点一经克服，主人公就提高一步。作者是在实实在在人的优点和弱点的基础上创造她的理想人格的。作者决不凭空臆造什么。人物的真实性便是作品的强大感染力的来源。
    女作家善于把人的提高和国家社会的发展交织在一起。在斯米尔诺娃的作品中，事变的演进不只为剧中人提供了广大的背景，而是决定主人公命运并在他们身上发生重大作用的因素。比如“乡村女教师”的主人公一生经历了许多历史事变，每一次事变都在她身上发生一定影响，把她推上新的更高的阶段。为了在巨大的画布上进行性格和心理的描绘，作者把叙事诗和抒情诗的要素结合到一起了。女教师和成了博士的学生的课堂问答，女医生和老院长的深夜长谈，这些场景之所以紧紧的抓住了我们的心，正是由于作者把我们带到了诗境。
    斯米尔诺娃对创作工作是极为严肃的。在座谈会上，她说：“‘乡村女教师’写完后，各方面评价很高。我冷静地看我的剧本，觉得还有许多地方必须修改。”又说，“剧本写完后应保持一定距离来看自己的作品，甚至可以放它一个时期，自己会更客观一些。这样才能发现自己作品的缺点，接受别人的批评。”毫无疑问，保持这样清醒头脑的作者自然会前进不息，永无止境的。
    斯米尔诺娃的长处，正是值得我国电影剧作者学习的。我们还不善于洞察劳动人民的新品质，还不善于把握他们的性格特征。我们常常不能从日常生活中发现惊人的事件，常常不能从不引人注意的地方揭露社会的深刻矛盾。总之，我们的成就和人民的要求是极不相称的。为了改变这种情况，我们必须很快把苏联电影剧作者的长处，变成我们自己的长处。我们除了加紧学习马克思、列宁主义，学习社会以外，还须加强对苏联文学和电影的学习。我们对于苏联电影和优秀的苏联电影文学，已经学了，而且十分注意地学了，但在学习上还缺乏系统性和组织性。这方面，我们是应当加以改进的。
