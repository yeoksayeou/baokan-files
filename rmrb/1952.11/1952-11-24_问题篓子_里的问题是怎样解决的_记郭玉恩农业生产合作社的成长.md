How Problems in the "Problem Basket" Are Resolved
    ——A Record of the Growth of the Guo Yu'en Agricultural Producers' Cooperative
    Zhao Xianbin

    When the Guo Yu'en Agricultural Producers' Cooperative in Chuandi Village, Pingshun, Shanxi, was established in April last year, some farmers who did not participate said, "Even three brothers sometimes disagree, so many people producing and distributing grain together, just wait and see them fight!" However, in the two years since then, there hasn't been a single fight within this cooperative. On the contrary, it has consolidated and developed – growing from eighteen households last year to forty-six households this year. Under its influence, this spring, Chuandi Village also organized the Shen Dongyu Agricultural Producers' Cooperative with twenty-four households. Moreover, Guo Laifu and others, who predicted last year that the cooperative would inevitably fall apart, personally saw the cooperative's strength and high yields and joined the cooperative this spring.

    Of course, the development of the Guo Yu'en Agricultural Producers' Cooperative was not smooth sailing. It did encounter many problems in the process of its establishment and development. The masses even called it a "problem basket." Guo Yu'en said, "If these problems cannot be solved in time, a real fight might break out." But they solved them one by one. Now let's take a look at what kind of problems are in the "problem basket" and how they were solved.

    The first problem the cooperative encountered was the issue of land entering the cooperative. How much to enter? Some proposed entering all, saying "this is clean and neat." Some proposed entering a large part, keeping a small part for growing vegetables and miscellaneous grains. Everyone felt that the second opinion was more appropriate, so it was democratically agreed that the minimum land to be entered into the cooperative should not be less than 70% of all the land owned, and the maximum self-retained land should not exceed 30%. After the proportions were determined, everyone reported which plots they would contribute. As a result, except for Guo Yu'en, Guo Zongkui, and Guo Jihao, three Party member cadres who reported more good land, most people reported bad land. Some Party members also reported bad land. Of the more than eighty mu of land reported by everyone, bad land, distant land, and small plots accounted for two-thirds. How could this work? Branch Secretary Guo Yu'en convened a branch meeting, calling on Party members joining the cooperative to contribute more good land, nearby land, and large plots. After the meeting, Guo Dejiao, Guo Yinzi, and other eight Party members took the lead. Guo Yu'en also discussed with everyone and stipulated that regardless of whether the land entering the cooperative was far or near, good or bad, it must be the largest possible plot. Small plots that could be connected together to form a large plot could also be entered. The amount of good land and bad land entered should be proportional to the self-retained land. Everyone reported and discussed publicly based on the above principles. This solved the land entry problem.

    Next came the issue of how to distribute dividends for land and labor. Those with less labor proposed "land and labor split the dividends equally," while those with more labor proposed "labor should get a larger share." Based on these two situations, the leading cadres of the cooperative educated the members about "labor creating value," agreed with the opinion that labor should get a larger share, and pointed out that the interests of members with more land and less labor should be appropriately taken care of. After democratic discussion, it was finally decided that land would receive 40% of the dividends, labor would receive 52% of the dividends, and the public accumulation fund would retain 8%.

    After the distribution plan was determined, everyone discussed specific ways to implement the plan. People who had processed the land less and managed it poorly in the past proposed "one mu entered gets one mu's worth of dividends," while those who managed it well proposed "dividends should be distributed in proportion to the actual yield." After discussion, everyone unanimously agreed to distribute according to the yield ratio. But what was the actual yield of each plot of land entering the cooperative? This became a problem again. In the past, when assessing agricultural tax yields, some people tried to report lower yields. After the land entered the cooperative, and dividends were distributed according to the actual yield, they tried to say that the yield of their land was higher. The problem of land yield assessment was debated for a long time and could not be resolved. The leading cadres of the cooperative repeatedly studied with everyone, and finally came up with the following method: Based on the actual yield of the previous year, find several standard land yields, let each member compare the land they want to enter the cooperative with the standard land, determine their own level, and then let the evaluation committee elected by everyone to judge. The evaluation committee made a preliminary opinion, and then all members discussed it. This was called the initial evaluation. After the initial evaluation, some members still had opinions, and the evaluation committee re-evaluated. The problem was not resolved until everyone had no objections. The problem of labor dividends was relatively easy to solve. Because all members were members of mutual aid teams in the past, everyone's labor points had already been assessed. At that time, it was determined that the principle of distribution should be based on the proportion of labor days performed by each laborer.

    When labor began, the problem of issuing work points arose again. Originally, the cooperative's work points were printed by the accountant and issued to the group leaders, who issued work points based on each person's labor days. When work points began to be issued, some members became suspicious. They suspected that the group leader would issue more work points to himself and his family members who participated in labor. They also suspected that the accountant might embezzle work points due to the convenience of his position, or falsely issue work points to his family members. The leading cadres of the cooperative led everyone to discuss ways to prevent these possible biases, and finally stipulated that the work done by the group leader should be signed by the deputy group leader and issued with work points. As far as possible, members of the same family should not work in the same group. It was stipulated that the accountant should "move the pen to do the books but not the seal." The seal was personally controlled by the director. The work points issued by the accountant must be stamped by the director of the cooperative. Work points without a stamp were considered invalid. In this way, the members' suspicions were dispelled, and the malpractices were avoided.

    In the process of cultivation, conflicts arose between cultivating the cooperative's land and cultivating self-retained land. Because the cooperative's land and self-retained land had to be planted in the same season, if it was not organized well, it would either affect the cooperative's production plan or delay the work on the self-retained land. The members of Guo Yinzi's group often affected the cooperative's production plan because they cultivated their own land. After everyone discussed this problem, it was stipulated that whether it was cooperative land or self-retained land, it would be cultivated uniformly by the cooperative; members who worked on their own self-retained land would be paid with work points by the owner of the land. The contradiction between the cultivation time of cooperative land and self-retained land was thus resolved.

    When it came time to apply topdressing fertilizer, the cooperative did not have any fertilizer (because the cooperative had just been established and there was no public fertilizer). Everyone decided to buy the fertilizer accumulated by the members, but only generally stipulated that each dou of corn would buy ten loads. At this time, people with good fertilizer raised objections: "Fertilizer has good and bad, and the price cannot be the same." The leading cadres of the cooperative felt that this opinion was very reasonable, so they went to inspect the manure piles of each household. Sure enough, the quality of the fertilizer in each household varied greatly. So it was decided to divide the fertilizer into three grades and nine levels, and pay according to the level. The grade of fertilizer was decided by the evaluation committee. The fertilizer problem was thus resolved.

    Many problems also occurred in the use of livestock. Last year, the livestock used was hired by the cooperative from various members. Initially, it was only generally stipulated that seven and a half jin of rice would be given for each mu of land cultivated. In this way, when combining plows, those who raised large livestock were willing to combine with those who raised large livestock, fearing that their large livestock would be combined with small livestock, which would require more effort and less land would be cultivated, resulting in losses. As a result, the small livestock were left behind. When plowing, everyone competed to plow the near land and large plots, and no one wanted to plow the far land and small plots. Later, everyone decided to evaluate the large and small livestock into different labor points, and then calculate the wages based on the amount of land plowed by each livestock per day; the different land of far, near, large, and small were specifically calculated for the number of workdays used each day, and the wages were adjusted according to the labor consumed by each plot of land. This problem was also resolved. This spring, with the economic strength, production development requirements, and members' awareness all improved, the cooperative began to implement the valuation of livestock entering the cooperative. When the valuation began, problems arose again. Households without livestock said that the price of livestock was not high this year (the price of livestock this year was indeed lower than last year); members who wanted to put good livestock into the cooperative said, "The price of bad livestock has dropped, but the price of good livestock has not dropped"; members who put bad livestock into the cooperative said, "I bought this livestock for this much money, it is not appropriate for me to lose money." Those with livestock and those without livestock argued endlessly, and it was difficult for the cadres to decide the price. Later, the cadres specially went to the Pingshun livestock market, invited several brokers, and invited a veterinarian from the veterinary station to check the livestock for problems, and appropriately valued them according to the quality of the livestock and the market price at the time, and the households with livestock and without livestock had no objections. But when the price of the livestock was set and they were about to enter the cooperative, the women of the households with livestock had objections again. They felt that it would be inconvenient to mill rice, grind flour, and visit relatives after the livestock entered the cooperative. Everyone discussed and stipulated that whoever had something to do could use the livestock, and using livestock for one day would cost three and a half jin of feed. But problems arose again during the use: Everyone wanted to use large livestock to operate the large millstone, because large livestock grind quickly and can pay less wages. As a result, the large livestock were busy, and the small livestock were idle. So everyone discussed and decided again: Large livestock should be used for large millstones, costing three and a half jin of feed per day, medium-sized livestock should be used for medium-sized millstones, costing three jin of feed per day, and small livestock should be used for small millstones, costing two and a half jin of feed per day. It was also stipulated that users should not pick their own livestock and must be allocated by the person managing the livestock. This also solved the problem of uneven busy and idle livestock and unfair payment.

    Due to the unscientific method of calculating work, the phenomenon of "loafing on the job" occurred in the cooperative this spring. The cooperative originally stipulated to go to and from the field with the sound of the gong, but Guo Yinzi's group could not go to the field even after the gong was sounded. They rested no less than other groups, but the work points they received were the same as other groups. Therefore, the groups that worked well raised objections. The cadres led everyone to study many times, and finally unanimously decided to implement the "four-fix contracting system" of fixed work, fixed personnel, fixed quantity, and fixed time, abolishing the simple system of recording work only by labor days. Each group elected inspectors to form an inspection team to check whether the work contracted by each group met the requirements of the "four-fix" system. If the work was not done well enough, the inspection team would decide to deduct work points. If the work was really terrible, they would be asked to redo it. If it was done badly (such as damaging seedlings when hoeing), the contracting group would be responsible for compensation. If it was done up to standard or completed ahead of schedule, work points would be issued according to the predetermined work. After the implementation of this system, it greatly encouraged the labor enthusiasm of the members. Those who used to "loaf on the job" became active, and those who used to go home for dinner when working in distant places now asked their families to send food for fear of delaying time by going home for dinner. Since the implementation of the "four-fix contracting system," the labor efficiency of the members has generally improved.

    The Guo Yu'en Agricultural Producers' Cooperative has produced and solved many other problems. Now they are not just solving problems as they encounter them. They have gradually grasped the regularity of various problems in the cooperative and can already foresee the problems that may arise in the future. This year, the cooperative bought 560 sheep, which will grow to 1,000 in three years. According to the village's pasture and drinking water conditions, the flock cannot be supported after it grows to 1,000. Obviously, the sheep bred in the future must be sold. But how to distribute the money from the sale of sheep will become a problem, because the time each household joined the cooperative is different, and the accumulation of each household is also different. Now they are considering how to solve this problem. Also, the price of livestock entering the cooperative was originally stipulated to be paid off in three to five years, but because the capital construction needed in their three-year construction plan is very large, the livestock price may not be repaid by then. That would arouse the opposition of the members who put the livestock into the cooperative. Now they are considering solving this problem by balancing the shares.

    From the above problems, it can be clearly seen that the problems in this so-called "problem basket" are all contradictions between the individual interests of the members and the overall interests of the cooperative. This is inevitable in an agricultural producers' cooperative, a collective labor production organization established on the basis of private ownership. But on the premise that the individual interests of the members are subordinate to the overall interests of the cooperative, in accordance with the principle of benefiting both the public and the private, they have solved them one by one by closely combining cadres with the masses and carrying out democratic discussions. I think this is the fundamental reason why the Guo Yu'en Agricultural Producers' Cooperative has not only not fought in the past two years, but has also been further consolidated and developed.

    “问题篓子”里的问题是怎样解决的
    ——记郭玉恩农业生产合作社的成长
    赵宪斌
    山西平顺川底村郭玉恩农业生产合作社在去年四月成立的时候，有些没有参加的农民就说：“弟兄三个两个还有个合不来的，那么多人在一起生产分粮，等着看他们打架吧！”但是，两年以来这个合作社内部并没有打过一次架，相反的，它竟巩固起来并且发展了——由去年的十八户发展到了今年的四十六户。在它的影响之下，今年春天，川底村又组织起了一个二十四户的申冬玉农业生产合作社。而且，去年预言合作社必然打架的郭来富等人，亲眼看到合作社力量大，产量高，也在今年春天入社了。
    当然，郭玉恩农业生产合作社的发展并不是一帆风顺的。它在建立、发展的过程中，确曾遇到过许多问题。群众也曾把它叫作“问题篓子”。郭玉恩说：“这些问题如果不能及时解决，真可能打起架来”。可是他们都把它一一解决了。现在我们就来看看“问题篓子”里装的都是些什么问题，他们又是怎样解决的。
    合作社遇到的第一个问题是土地入社问题。入多少呢？有人提出全部入，说“这样干净利落”。有人提出入一大部，自己留一小部种菜、种杂粮。大家觉得第二种意见还比较合适，就民主议定了入社地最少不得少于自己所有全部土地的百分之七十，自留地最多不能超过百分之三十。比例确定后，就由大家自报入那块地。结果，除郭玉恩、郭宗奎、郭计好三个党员干部多报了一些好地外，其余的人多是自报了坏地。有些党员也报了坏地。在大家自报的八十多亩地中，坏地、远地、小块地就占了三分之二。这怎么能行呢？支部书记郭玉恩召开了支部大会，号召入社党员多入好地、近地、大块地。会后郭得交、郭银子等八个党员，都起了带头作用。郭玉恩又和大家民主讨论规定：入社地无论远近好坏，都必须尽大块地，能连在一起合成大块的小块地也可以入；入多少好地、坏地，要和自留地的比例相当。大家根据以上原则进行自报公议。这就解决了入地问题。
    跟着来的是土地和劳力怎样分红的问题。劳力少的提出“土地劳力对半分红”，劳力多的提出“劳力应该多分一点”。社的领导干部根据这两种情况，向社员们进行了“劳动创造价值”的教育，同意了劳动力多分一些的意见，同时指出要适当照顾土地多劳力少的社员的利益。经过民主讨论，最后决定土地分红百分之四十，劳力分红百分之五十二，公积金留百分之八。
    分配方案确定了，大家又讨论具体执行这个方案的办法。过去对土地加工少、经营得不好的人提出：“入一亩顶一亩分”，而经营得好的人提出
    “要按实产量成比例分”。经过讨论，大家一致同意按产量比例分。但每块入社地的实产量是多少，又成了问题。过去评农业税产量时，有些人尽量把产量报得低些，土地入社后按实产量分红，他又尽量把自己的土地的产量说得高些。土地评产的问题争论了好久，还解决不了。社的领导干部和大家反覆研究，最后想出了这样一个办法：根据上一年的实产量，找出几种标准地的产量，让每个社员把自己要入社的土地，和标准地相比，自己确定等级，然后由大家选出的评判委员会来评判。评判委员会评出初步意见，再由全体社员进行讨论。这叫做初评。经过初评，有些社员仍有意见，再由评判委员会进行复评。一直评到大家没意见时，才算解决了问题。劳力分红的问题比较容易解决。因为所有社员过去都是互助组的组员，每个人有几分劳动力，过去都已评定过。当时就确定了按每个劳动力所做劳动日多少的比例，进行分配的原则。
    劳动开始了，又产生了计发工票问题。原来社的工票是由会计印制，发给各小组长，小组长根据每个人的劳动日计发工票。开始发工票时，有些社员发生了怀疑。他们怀疑小组长会给他自己和他家里参加劳动的人多发工票。又怀疑会计可能由于职务的方便而贪污工票，或者会给自己家里人冒发工票。社的领导干部领导大家讨论了防范这些可能发生的偏向的办法，最后规定：组长做的工，由副组长签字发给工票。尽可能不使一个家庭的成员在同
    一个组内劳动。规定会计“动笔做账不动章”。图章由主任亲自掌握。会计发的工票必须要经过社长盖章。没有盖章的工票算废票。这样社员的怀疑解除了，弊病也避免了。
    在耕种当中，又发生了耕种社的土地和耕种自留地的矛盾。因为社的土地和自留地都必须在同一个季节内种完，如果组织得不好，不是影响了社的生产计划，就会误了自留地的活。郭银子组的社员就常常因为耕作自己的土地而影响了社的生产计划。这个问题经过大家讨论，规定：无论社地或自留地，都由社统一耕作；社员们在谁家的自留地上做了活，就由谁付给工票。社地和自留地耕作时间的矛盾就这样解决了。
    到施追肥的时候，社里还没有肥料（因社刚成立，没有公共的肥料）。大家决定购买社员们积下的肥料，但只笼统地规定每斗玉茭买十担。这时，有好肥料的人提出了意见：“粪有好坏，不能一样作价”。社领导干部觉得这意见很有道理，就到各家粪堆去察看。果然各家的肥料的质量相差很远。于是又决定把肥料分成三等九级，按级给价。肥料的等级由评判委员会评判决定。肥料问题就这样解决了。
    在使用牲口方面，也发生了不少问题。去年使用的牲口是由社向各个社员雇的。最初，只笼统地规定了每耕一亩地，给七斤半米。这样，在合犋时，养大牲畜的都愿和养大牲畜的合在一起，怕自己的大牲畜和小牲畜合在一起，费力多，耕地少，吃了亏。结果就把小牲畜留下了。耕地时，谁都争着耕近地和大块地，都不愿耕远地和小块地。后来，大家决定把大、小牲畜评成不同的劳动分、再按每个牲口每天耕地的数量计算工资；又把远、近、大、小不同的土地具体计算出每天所用的工数，根据每块地耗费的劳力调整工资。这个问题也解决了。今年春天，合作社在经济力量、生产发展的要求、社员的觉悟程度都提高了的情况下，开始实行牲口作价入社。在开始作价的时候，又发生了问题。无牲畜户说今年牲畜价不高（今年的牲畜价格的确较去年低了些）；要把好牲畜入社的社员却说：“赖的落价了，好的并没有落价”；把赖牲畜入社的社员说：“我这牲畜是多少钱买的，让我赔钱不合适”。有牲畜的和无牲畜的争论不休，干部也很难决定价格。后来，干部特别到平顺牲畜市上，请来了几个牙纪，再到兽医站请了兽医，检查牲口有无毛病，并根据牲畜好坏和当时的市价适当作价，有牲畜户和无牲畜户都没了意见。但牲畜作好价钱，就要入社的时候，有牲畜户的妇女又有了意见。她们感到牲畜入了社，碾米、磨面、串亲戚都不方便了。大家又讨论规定：谁家有事时可以使用牲畜，使一天牲畜，出三斤半料。但在使用当中又发生了问题：谁家也愿使大牲畜，套大碾磨，因为大牲畜磨的快，可以少出工资。结果造成大牲口忙，小牲口闲的现象。这样大家又讨论决定：用大碾磨的使用大牲畜，每天三斤半料，用中等碾磨的用中等的牲畜，每天三斤料，用小碾磨的用小牲畜，每天二斤半料。并规定使用户不得自己挑牲畜，必须由管理牲畜的人调配。这样又解决了牲畜忙闲不均与付价不公的问题。
    由于计工方法不科学，今年春天在社内发生了“磨洋工”的现象。社里原规定打锣上地、下地，但郭银子组打了锣还上不了地，休息时比别的组不少休息，得到的工票和别的组却是一样的。因此，劳动好的组就提出了意见。干部领导大家研究了好多次，最后一致决定实行定工、定员、定量、定时的“四定包工制度”，废除了简单的只按劳动日记工的制度。并由各组选出检查员，组成检查小组，检查各组所包的工是否合乎“四定”的要求。做工做得不够好的由检查组议定扣工，做得实在不像话的让他重新做，做坏了的（如锄苗伤了苗子）由包工的组负责赔偿，做得够标准或提前完成的，按预定工发给工票。这一制度实行后，大大鼓舞了社员的劳动积极性。过去“磨洋工”的积极起来了，过去到远地做活的下工都要回家吃饭，现在怕回来吃饭耽误时间，都要家里人去送饭了。实行“四定包工制”以来，社员的劳动效率普遍提高了。
    郭玉恩农业生产合作社产生和解决的问题，还有许多。现在他们已不是遇到什么问题就解决什么问题了，他们已经逐渐摸着合作社的各种问题的规律性，已经可以预见到今后可能产生的问题了。今年合作社买了五百六十只羊，三年后即可发展到一千只。根据本村的牧草和饮水条件，羊群发展到一千只以后就不能再养活了。显然，今后繁殖的羊群必须出卖。但卖羊的钱如何分配会成为问题，因各户入社时间不同，每户的积累也不相同。现在他们正在考虑这个问题的解决办法。又如，入社牲畜的代价，原规定三年至五年还清，但因他们所订的三年建设计划中，基本建设需要的开支很大，届时牲畜价可能归还不了。那就会引起把牲畜入社的社员的反对。现在他们正在考虑用平衡入股的方法解决这个问题。
    从以上发生的问题，可以很明显地看出：这个所谓“问题篓子”里的问题都是社员的个人利益和社的整体利益所发生的矛盾。这是在私有基础上建立起来的集体劳动生产组织——农业生产合作社所不可避免的。但他们在社员的个人利益服从社的整体利益的前提下，按照公私两利的原则，采取由干部密切结合群众，进行民主讨论的方法，把它一一解决了。我想这就是郭玉恩农业生产合作社两年来不但未打起架来，而且得到了进一步巩固发展的根本原因。
