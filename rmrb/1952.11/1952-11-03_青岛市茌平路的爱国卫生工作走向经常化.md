    Qingdao's Chuping Road Patriotic Health Work Moves Towards Regularization
    Yang Yang
    The Patriotic Health Campaign is a great mass political movement, and also a great movement to change customs and habits; it can not only improve people's health, but also enhance people's thinking and promote people's friendship and unity. This is nowhere more clear than in the health work of Chuping Road in Qingdao.
    Chuping Road is a residential area for middle-class families, with a total of thirteen addresses. In the old society, residents developed selfish habits, and they didn't even ask about what happened in the same courtyard. In the past, the streets of Chuping Road were full of feces and urine, and the garbage on the sidewalks was piled higher than the walls. The "three-no-management area" at the east end of the street, bordering Changqing Road and the mortuary of the Municipal Hospital, was even worse. Not only was there a manure yard, but also weeds grew half a person tall. The series of stinking ditches flowing down from Changqing Road became a major base for flies and mosquitoes. Every summer, many residents got sick. Zheng, a military dependent living in courtyard number three, recalled the situation at the time: "In the past, you had to pinch your nose and walk quickly as soon as you left the door; you still felt chills when you got home." In fact, the indoor hygiene of each household was also very poor. Wang Guilan from courtyard number one had not mopped the floor once in the two years since she got married. Wang Yongzhen only discovered that the shoe tube under the bed had become a rat's nest during this cleaning campaign.
    After the Patriotic Health Campaign was launched, the entire road, from household to courtyard, mobilized everyone, old and young, to achieve "everyone loves cleanliness, every household pays attention to hygiene." The streets were no longer visible with any garbage, paper baskets and spittoons were set up along the road, and each courtyard and household was cleaned very cleanly and neatly, even the bed boards were washed and scrubbed clean at any time. Old lady Dong, who is seventy-three years old, her daughter-in-law went to the hospital, her son is busy with production in the factory and does not return at night, she is at home alone with her young grandson. In addition to bathing the child every day, she also wipes the door and window frames spotless. Woman Kuang Huizhi said: "I'm used to being clean. As long as I don't sweep the floor at night, I'm always worried about it even when I'm in bed, and I must get up and sweep it again before I can fall asleep." Over time, hygiene has become a daily habit of the masses, and children also know how to be clean. Children of four or five years old refuse to go to bed at night if they have not been bathed during the day. Yang Huiqing from courtyard number nine is the mother of eight children. After September, when the weather turned cold, she planned to divide the children into two groups and take turns bathing each child every other day. However, the children were used to bathing every day, and after bathing those four, the other four also jumped into the washbasin. Now, if someone passes by Chuping Road and carelessly spits or throws away a piece of fruit peel or scrap paper, a child will run up to make a suggestion: "Comrade, I picked up the fruit peel you dropped and put it in the bamboo basket. Please pay attention next time. Please spit in the spittoon on the side of the road in the future."
    "The health campaign has united Chuping Road into one family," everyone who has visited the health work of Chuping Road has such a deep feeling. This is true. In the past, people living on Chuping Road didn't even know the names of some of their close neighbors. Now, everyone knows all 360 adults and children on the entire road. Many families don't even lock their doors when they go out. Even if they do lock their doors, they hang the keys on the door head. Because Wang Xuefang's wife gave birth to a child, he had to go to the hospital to take care of her, and no one was at home for several days in a row. However, the neighbors cleaned his house spotlessly, and even sunned the bedding to make it warm. The neighbors said: "We mop the floor for him when we mop the floor once; we sun the bedding for him when we sun the bedding once. We don't spend much effort, but everyone can keep it clean." Grandma Zhou Shumei from courtyard number nine makes a living by selling baked cakes. On weekdays, when business is busy, the neighbors scramble to take care of her children. Now the residents of Chuping Road all say: "As soon as we hear the word 'Chuping Road,' we feel particularly close. There is no distinction between us...."
    The Patriotic Health Campaign on Chuping Road has gone through a difficult process. During the health blitz week in early April, although women were initially mobilized, most were unwilling to sweep the streets. They said: "What does it look like for women to sweep the streets!" When Han Shufang from number thirteen was sweeping the street, she saw an acquaintance coming from afar and was so ashamed that she hid back home. Especially later, when everyone's time was not enough, some people started to complain: "We're doing sanitation all day long, but sanitation can't be eaten." Women with children said even more: "How can we do it! There are few people at home, and it's hard enough for one person to cook, take care of children, and manage everything else. How can we have time to do sanitation?" Seeing this situation, health committee member Qiao Xuzheng and group leader Ye Caixian felt that if they did not find a way to organize the masses as soon as possible, the movement would definitely collapse. Therefore, they took the initiative to seek help from various street organizations (such as the security group, the Sino-Soviet Friendship Group, the reading group, the women's group, etc.), and everyone discussed how to carry out the work. At the same time, residents were mobilized to widely discuss the great significance of carrying out the Patriotic Health Campaign within the reading group, and first broke the masses' idea that "it's good to do sanitation, but it's embarrassing." Ye Caixian further united a group of activists, took the lead in cleaning up dirty places, and then went separately to take care of children for women with children, so that the mothers could free up their hands to do sanitation. After a long time, everyone developed a habit, and even mothers with children could help each other take care of children. Everyone felt that this kind of mutual assistance was good, and further demanded that this form be fixed. Therefore, each courtyard successively formed women's health mutual aid groups according to each family's cooking time (some cook two meals a day, some cook three meals a day). Since then, the health movement on Chuping Road has had a basis for becoming regularized.
    On the basis of the women's health mutual aid group, courtyard number one further established a "small daycare center", vacated an empty room, and regularly gathered infants under five years old from the entire courtyard every day, with the mothers taking turns to take care of them. In this way, adults have more time to take care of their own housework and participate in learning. However, later the number of people entrusted to the daycare center gradually decreased. Health committee member Qiao Xuzheng learned that this was because everyone disagreed with taking turns taking care of the children. So he immediately convened a meeting of all the mothers in the courtyard, and had everyone elect six model mothers to take turns taking care of the children, while other mothers would replace them in swatting flies. After this method was implemented, the mothers were willing to send their children to the "small daycare center." Fu Guiying, who was elected, said: "I will definitely do my best to take good care of the children, so that everyone can trust our daycare center."
    Because everyone always maintained the spirit of mutual assistance and unity, and plannedly distributed their daily working hours, they guaranteed the regularity and persistence of health work.
    The Patriotic Health Campaign on Chuping Road was able to go deep and persist also because they established and guaranteed the implementation of various health systems. They effectively implemented the mutual assistance and mutual inspection system, the system of "contracting" responsibility for different sections, and the rotational cleaning system. The mutual assistance and mutual inspection system and the system of "contracting" responsibility for different sections are good methods to stimulate the masses' self-esteem and strengthen the masses' sense of responsibility. Many people would first thoroughly inspect their own homes before they went to inspect the hygiene of others. Rotational cleaning allows everyone to take turns resting. Until now, the people of Chuping Road still adhere to the habit of cleaning twice a day, morning and afternoon, and each time is more in-depth and thorough than the last. They also seriously promoted the "Patriotic Health Day". On this day, Chuping Road is particularly busy. In addition to conducting a comprehensive cleaning during the day, they study health knowledge in the reading group in the evening, and check the implementation of the challenge conditions by each household in the past week using the method of criticism and self-criticism based on the records in the health diary, and then select "leaders" (activists, selected once a week) and propose the health slogan for the next week as everyone's goal.
    With the change in sanitary conditions, the lives of the residents of Chuping Road are full of joy and happiness. Since this spring, no one, adult or child, on the entire road has suffered from infectious diseases. In addition, in the Patriotic Health Campaign, everyone is as united as a family, and they deeply realize the benefits of this movement. In order to do a better job in health work, they proposed nine challenge conditions and launched a friendship competition to health groups throughout the city. They also formulated patriotic health covenants for each household according to the different circumstances of each household to ensure the realization of the challenge conditions.
    Because they faithfully fulfill the challenge conditions they have set out and check the implementation at any time, everyone who goes to visit can receive an extremely profound education. Their good methods of organizing mutual aid groups and establishing daycare centers were immediately promoted. Now, more than 40% of the units and residential health groups in Qingdao have responded to the challenge from Chuping Road, and thousands of workers, family members, students, and residents have visited Chuping Road. The development of the health movement on Chuping Road has played a role in promoting the further comprehensive and in-depth development of the Patriotic Health Campaign in Qingdao.

    青岛市茌平路的爱国卫生工作走向经常化
    杨阳
    爱国卫生运动是一个伟大的群众性的政治运动，也是一个伟大的移风易俗的运动；它不仅能增进人民的健康，而且能提高人们的思想，促进人们的友爱团结。这在青岛市茌平路的卫生工作中看得再也没有那么清楚了。
    茌平路是一个中等家庭的住宅区，一共有十三个门牌。在旧社会里，居民们养成了自私习惯，就是同院发生了什么事情，也是互不闻问。过去，在茌平路的街上，到处都是大小便，人行道上的垃圾堆得比墙还高；街东头和长清路、市立医院太平间交界的“三不管地方”，更是糟糕。这里不仅有马粪场，而且长着半人高的杂草。从长清路流下来的一系臭水沟，更成了苍蝇、蚊子的大本营。每到夏天，很多居民都闹病。住在三号院的军属郑大娘回忆当时的情况时说：“过去一出大门就得捏住鼻子紧走几步；回了家还叫人打冷噤。”其实，每家的室内卫生也是搞得非常差劲的。一号院的王桂兰，结婚两年了，还没有擦过一次地板；王永珍还是这次在大扫除时，才发现床下的皮鞋统已经成了老鼠的安乐窝。
    爱国卫生运动展开后，全路由户到院，老老少少全部动员起来，做到了“人人爱清洁，户户讲卫生”的地步。街道上再也看不见一点垃圾，沿路都设有纸篓和痰盂，各院各户也收拾得很清洁、很整齐，连床板都随时洗刷干净。七十三岁的董老大娘，儿媳上医院去了，儿子在工厂里忙着生产，夜里也不回来，她一个人带着小孙孙在家，每天除了给孩子洗澡以外，还把门缝窗棂擦得纤尘不留。妇女匡慧芝说：“干净惯了，只要晚上没扫地，就是上了床心里也老耽着桩心事，一定还要起来打扫一遍才睡得着。”时间久了，卫生成了群众的日常生活习惯，孩子们也都知道爱干净了。四、五岁的孩子，只要白天没给他洗澡，晚上就不肯上床睡觉。九号院的杨慧卿是八个孩子的母亲，九月以后天气凉了，她打算把孩子分成两班，轮流着隔一天给每个孩子洗澡一次，可是，孩子们每天都洗惯了，才洗着这四个，那四个也跳进水盆来了。现在，假如有人经过茌平路不经心地吐了口痰，或是丢下块果皮、碎纸，那就会有小孩跑来提意见：“同志，你丢的果皮我给你拣起来放到竹筐里了，下次请你注意。请你以后把痰吐到路旁的痰盂里。”
    “卫生运动把茌平路团结成一家人了”，凡是参观过茌平路的卫生工作的人们都有这样深切的感觉。这是真实的。过去住在茌平路的人，连紧邻姓什么有些人都搞不清楚。现在，全路三百六十多个大人和小孩，大家都认识了。有很多人家，出门都不锁门了，即使锁上门，也都把钥匙挂在门头上。王学芳因为妻子生孩子，自己要到医院去照看，一连好几天都没人在家，可是，邻居们却把他的家收拾得干干净净，连被褥都晒得暖烘烘的。邻居们说：“我们擦一次地板，就给他擦一次；我们晒一次床铺，也给他晒一次，我们花不了多少力气，可是大家都能保持清洁。”九号院的周淑美大娘靠卖烤蛋糕过活，平日生意忙的时候，邻居们就争着代她照看孩子。现在茌平路的居民都说：“我们只要一听说是‘茌平路的’这个词儿，就特别感觉得亲切，那能分彼此……。”
    茌平路的爱国卫生运动是经过了一段困难过程的。在四月初的卫生突击周内，妇女们虽然初步发动起来，但多数都不愿打扫街道，她们说：“妇女扫马路，像个什么样子！”十三号的韩淑芳在扫街时，远远看见一个熟人走来，就羞得躲回家去了。特别是后来当大家的时间不够分配时，有些人就发起牢骚来：“成天搞卫生，卫生又不能当饭吃。”有孩子的妇女更说：“怎么得了啊！家里人手少，一个人光做饭、看孩子还张罗不过来，那有工夫搞卫生。”卫生委员乔绪政和组长叶彩仙看到这种情形，觉得若不想法把群众及早组织起来，运动就一定要垮下去。于是，他们便主动地争取了各种街道组织（如治安组、中苏友好小组、读报组、妇女组等）的帮助，大家商量着来进行工作。同时发动居民在读报组内广泛讨论开展爱国卫生运动的伟大意义，首先打破了群众“搞卫生好倒好，就是丢面子”的思想。叶彩仙更进一步团结了一批积极分子，带头收拾脏地方，然后又分头替有孩子的妇女领孩子，让母亲们腾出手来搞卫生。日子一久，大家都养成习惯了，连有孩子的母亲也能彼此帮忙照应孩子了。大家觉得这样互助好，进而要求把这种形式固定下来，所以，各院都先后按照各家的做饭时间
    （有的一天做两顿饭，有的一天做三顿饭）自由组合，成立了妇女卫生互助组。从此，茌平路的卫生运动才有了经常化的基础。
    在妇女卫生互助组的基础上，一号院进一步成立了一个“小托儿站”，腾出一间空屋，每天定时把全院五周岁以下的婴孩集中起来，由母亲们轮值看管。这样，大人们便有更多的时间去料理自己的家务和参加学习。可是，后来托儿站的受托人数却慢慢减少了。卫生委员乔绪政了解到这是因为大家不同意轮流值日看管孩子的缘故。于是他马上召开了全院的母亲会，由大家评选出六个模范母亲来专门轮流看孩子，而由别的母亲来代替他们打蝇子。这个办法实行后，母亲们都乐意把自己的孩子送到“小托儿站”了。当选的傅桂英说：“我一定尽力把孩子们带好，让大家都相信我们的托儿站。”
    由于大家始终保持着互助、团结的精神，并有计划地支配了每天的工作时间，从而保证了卫生工作的经常和持久。
    茌平路的爱国卫生运动所以能够深入，持久，还因为他们订立和保证执行了各种卫生制度。他们有效地实行了互助互查、分段“包干”负责的制度和轮值清扫的制度。互助互查和分段“包干”负责的制度，是激发群众的自尊心和加强群众责任感的很好的方法。很多人在要去检查别人的卫生状况时，都先要把自己家里详细检查一遍。轮值清扫，可以使大家交替着休息。直到现在，茌平路的人们还坚持着每日上下午清扫两遍的习惯，而且一次比一次更加深入和彻底了。他们还认真推行了“爱国卫生日”，每到这一天，茌平路是特别紧张的。除了白天进行全面大扫除外，晚上在读报组内就学习卫生常识，并根据卫生日记簿的记录，用批评和自我批评的方法检查一周来各家执行挑战条件的情况，然后评选“带头人”（积极分子，每周评选一次），提出下周的卫生口号，作为大家的奋斗目标。
    随着卫生状况的改变，茌平路居民的生活充满了乐趣和幸福。从今年春天以来，全路的大人、小孩，没有一个人害传染病。另外，在爱国卫生运动中，大家都团结得一家人似的，他们深深体会到这个运动的好处。他们为了把卫生工作搞得更好，曾提出了九项挑战条件，向全市各卫生小组发起友谊竞赛。他们又根据各家的不同情况，订立了各家的爱国卫生公约，以保证挑战条件的实现。
    由于他们忠实地履行着自己所定出来的挑战条件，并随时检查执行情况，使每个前往参观的人，都能受到一次极其深刻的教育。他们组织互助组和成立托儿站的好办法，马上便被推广开来。现在，全青岛市已有百分之四十以上的单位和居民卫生组向茌平路应战，并有上千的工人、眷属、学生和居民的参观团到茌平路进行过访问。茌平路卫生运动的开展，对青岛全市的爱国卫生运动的进一步走向全面深入，起了推动的作用。
