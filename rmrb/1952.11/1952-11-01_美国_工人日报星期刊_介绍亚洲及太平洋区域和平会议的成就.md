Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 30th. The New York "Worker's Daily Weekly" published on the 26th of this month carried a special feature on the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference, titled "A Conference Where Half of Humanity Strives for Peace." The feature occupied two pages and included several photos of the conference venue and the representatives attending the meeting.

This issue also published an editorial commenting on the significance of the conference, saying: Why do American newspapers distort the significance and achievements of this great conference? The answer can be found in the main issues discussed at the conference. The newspapers employed by American imperialists have tried every means to fabricate rumors and slander the conference. However, rumors and slanders only expose the panicked and embarrassed appearance of the exploiters and their lackeys. Their fear is well-founded because the genuine representation of the delegations from Asian countries, the truly patriotic content of their speeches, and the resolutions unanimously reached after careful consideration, all make it impossible to forget forever the leading role played by the people of the participating countries in solving world problems. This leadership role—coupled with the great example they have set in international unity—courageously challenges the exploiters. It shows the world that there is no safe place for imperialist aggressors in the Asian and Pacific regions. The editorial concludes by pointing out: The main goal of the people in the Asian and Pacific regions is also the goal of the American people.

    美国“工人日报星期刊”
    介绍亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的成就
    【新华社布拉格三十日电】本月二十六日出版的纽约“工人日报星期刊”刊载了关于亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的特稿，题为“半数人类争取和平的会议”，特稿共占两页篇幅，并附有几张大会会场和出席会议的代表的照片。
    这一期并刊载了评论会议意义的社论说：为什么美国报纸歪曲这个伟大的会议的意义和成绩呢？从会议讨论的各项主要问题中就可找到答案。美国帝国主义者雇用的报纸千方百计地拚命造谣污蔑会议。但是，造谣与污蔑反而暴露了剥削者及其走狗惊慌失措的狼狈相。他们的恐惧是很有理由的，因为亚洲各国代表团的真正代表性，它们的发言的真正爱国内容和经过慎重考虑后才一致达成的决议，这一切都使人永远不能忘记与会各国的人民在解决世界问题方面所起的领导作用。这种领导作用——加上他们在国际团结方面所树立的伟大榜样——英勇地向剥削者提出了挑战。它昭示全世界：在亚洲及太平洋区域已经没有帝国主义侵略者的安全场所了。社评最后指出：亚洲及太平洋区域人民的主要目标也是美国人民的目标。
