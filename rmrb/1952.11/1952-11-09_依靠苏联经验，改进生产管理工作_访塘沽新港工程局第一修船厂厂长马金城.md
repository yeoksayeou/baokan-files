    Relying on Soviet Experience to Improve Production Management
    —An Interview with Ma Jincheng, Director of the No. 1 Shipyard of the Tanggu New Port Engineering Bureau
    Zha Ruizhuan

    I once visited Comrade Ma Jincheng, the director of the No. 1 Shipyard of the Tanggu New Port Engineering Bureau. Comrade Ma Jincheng is a veteran cadre who has undergone a long period of revolutionary training. In 1950, he studied in the first factory management class of the Renmin University's special training program for eight months. After returning to his post, he flexibly applied the advanced Soviet experience he learned to the actual work of the shipyard and achieved significant results.

    Although the No. 1 Shipyard has made great progress since liberation, it had been unable to formulate a production plan for a long time, and the work fell into a state of chaos. Many outdated things hindered the rapid development of production. In order to change this situation, Comrade Ma Jincheng, based on the actual situation, used advanced Soviet experience to carry out reforms in production organization and technology. He decided to start with reforming accounting work first. Some old accountants opposed the change to the new accounting system. Comrade Ma Jincheng initially did not talk about reforming the accounting system, but simplified the principles of "Industrial Bookkeeping and Accounting" he learned at the university into eight charts, combined with the actual situation in the factory, to explain the overall situation of the factory and point out which parts of the factory's accounting should be revised. Because he combined theory with the daily work that everyone was familiar with, educating the accounting staff, the accounting staff began to realize the necessity of reforming the accounting work. Therefore, he organized several experienced accountants who were willing to accept new things and established a teaching and research office, and set up a small accounting training class. Using the textbook compiled by Professor Makarov of the Soviet Union as teaching material, he trained more than 30 new accounting staff from August to December last year. Relying on these 30 people, a scientific new accounting system was established, which basically solved the problems existing in the factory's cost accounting. Now these 30 people have become a backbone force for the reform of accounting work in the New Port Engineering Bureau.

    At the same time, the shipyard also carried out the reform of statistical work. In the past, in statistical work, the factory did not proceed from the actual situation, but mechanically used monetary indicators to calculate the labor productivity of the repair shop, resulting in a contradiction in which the actual workload increased, but the labor productivity decreased. In order to establish correct statistics, Comrade Ma Jincheng also started by introducing Soviet experience and training cadres, organizing a statistical teaching and research office, and running a small statistical training class, using Professor Shavinsky's "Industrial Statistics Tutorial" as teaching material, teaching more than 140 hours, and training more than 20 new statistical talents. The past erroneous indicators were abandoned, and man-hour indicators were used to calculate labor productivity, correctly reflecting the improvement of work efficiency in the shipyard. On this basis, a set of reasonable statistical reports was formulated. Now, from the statistical charts hanging in the director's office, one can clearly see the overall picture of the factory's work.

    Both teaching and research offices were headed by leading cadres in business as directors, who were responsible for teaching after self-study. The factory director served as deputy director and personally tutored the main lecturers. In addition, several people with better business skills and willingness to humbly learn new things were hired as internship teachers. The shipyard's experience proves that establishing such a teaching organization in production enterprises, with leading comrades taking personal responsibility, combined with the actual situation, systematically imparting advanced Soviet experience to business and technical personnel, and training cadres is very effective in improving business work.

    Comrade Ma Jincheng also helped the cadres learn courses such as enterprise organization and planning and technical norms, which prepared favorable conditions for rectifying production organization. In the rectification of production organization, the original "functional" organizational form was changed to "production area system," thereby clarifying responsibilities, improving production management, and improving work efficiency. After learning technical norms, everyone had the confidence to tap potential. Foremen have already understood that as long as the machine operation time is equal to or greater than the manual time, multi-machine management can be carried out.

    The production plan problem was a problem that the shipyard had never solved in the past because the shipyard is a more complex large-scale repair factory. It has no fixed production tasks, but serves shipping (repairing passenger and cargo ships), public works (repairing dredgers, etc.), and has many temporary rush jobs. The scale of work is also very different (such as repairing 10,000-ton ships to as small as making keys). In the past few years, many methods have been tried to formulate production plans, but they have never been successful. In the spring of 1950, there was even an opinion that "it is impossible to formulate a production plan for a shipyard." When Comrade Ma Jincheng began to study enterprise organization and planning at Renmin University, he was not sure whether the Soviet experience could be used in the shipyard. When he learned the principle that the plan should be formulated "from back to front," he realized that there was also a way to formulate a plan in the shipyard. After returning to the factory, he actively carried out the work of formulating a plan. In September last year, the "from back to front" method was used for the first time to formulate a plan. For example, to repair a ship, first plan the required completion date and determine what the last job is; if the last job is to install the main shaft, then it can be determined when the fitter can start installation, when the machinist can finish machining, and when the forger and the caster should supply the machinist with its accessories, screws, and large tiles for processing, etc. Through such analysis, this complex ship repair project can be carried out in a planned and step-by-step manner, thereby avoiding waiting-for-work phenomena. After the experiment was successful, he applied this method to the overhaul of dredgers, ensuring the completion of the winter overhaul task and creating a new record of repairing six dredgers in one winter last year. This example educated those who thought that it was impossible to formulate a plan in the shipyard.

    After the "Three-Anti" movement, the shipyard put forward a new task—to promote quotas and improve work efficiency. Comrade Ma Jincheng conveyed to everyone the three principles of researching potential in technical quotas: 1. Which operations are unnecessary and can be cancelled; 2. Which operations can be carried out simultaneously or alternately; 3. Which operations take the most time in the work, and how to shorten the time. This was originally a general principle in technical quotas. Now, he applied this principle to the entire ship repair project. For example, at that time, a dredger of the New Port Engineering Bureau had a problem and was stranded in Qingdao. According to the usual steps, to repair this ship, one would have to wait for the ship to arrive, check the damaged parts, and then design, draw drawings, and construct, repairing one place and then repairing another. It was estimated that it would take 45 days to repair. However, they used advanced Soviet experience and adopted revolutionary methods, and directly sent people by train to Qingdao to study the situation, draw sketches, and combine the above principles with the production plan: First, list all the engineering items, and list the various operating procedures such as disassembly, lifting, handling, machinery, fitting, riveting, welding, etc., as well as the required number of people, hours, etc., to review and study whether these operating items are all necessary. Secondly, study which operations or engineering items can be carried out simultaneously or alternately. Finally, review which operation and engineering take the most time, and study how to concentrate forces to tackle this point in order to shorten the entire engineering period. They called this method "operation plan."

    After such careful analysis and research, all staff members could understand the steps of the entire repair process. Therefore, according to the plan, they fully prepared manpower and equipment, and even the telephone lines were hung up. As soon as the ship docked, the workers started repairing within ten minutes and proceeded in parallel according to the original plan. In this way, the project that used to take 45 days was completely repaired in only 56 hours, creating an unprecedented record for the shipyard. When they repaired a large Czech cargo ship, they also applied this method and completed the ship repair task that took one month in half a month. These two tasks are also excellent examples of flexibly applying Soviet experience in combination with the actual situation. This method has now been widely promoted and applied to the work of rushing to repair ships during the port construction period.

    Another major event in the shipyard was the holding of "skilled worker rapid training classes." Last year, because the production scale of the shipyard was expanded, a large number of skilled workers needed to be added, but they could not be replenished in time. According to the old method of training skilled workers in the past, it would take at least three to five years. This problem lingered in Comrade Ma Jincheng's mind for a long time. He decided to adopt short-term accelerated training methods to solve this problem. He repeatedly explained the necessity and possibility of short-term accelerated training of workers to technical personnel and skilled workers, cleared their minds, and hired them as teachers. Then, he recruited a group of young people with high school or junior high school education, established a training class, and used methods such as large classes, internships, and basic training (that is, factory internships, actual operations) for training. In large classes, technical personnel lectured on courses such as factory mathematics, mechanical drawing, and mechanical principles, and skilled workers led these students to conduct factory internships. Students could do preliminary work after two weeks. After six months, 90% of the students could pass the graduation exam. Now the shipyard has trained three batches of students, which not only solved the problem of the lack of skilled workers but also improved the business level of cadres. The shipyard also opened training classes for drafting, basic-level cadres, abacus, and economic accounting at the section (chief) and field (director) levels, all of which achieved success.

    From the work of the shipyard led by Comrade Ma Jincheng, we can see that as long as we can conscientiously study advanced Soviet experience and combine Soviet experience with China's actual situation, we can definitely improve and improve the management work of the factory.

    依靠苏联经验，改进生产管理工作
    ——访塘沽新港工程局第一修船厂厂长马金城
    查瑞传
    我曾经访问了塘沽新港工程局第一修船厂厂长马金城同志。马金城同志是一位受过长期革命锻炼的老干部。一九五○年他在人民大学专修科第一期工厂管理班学习了八个月，回到工作岗位以后，他把自己所学的苏联先进经验灵活地运用在修船厂的实际工作中，有了显著的成绩。
    第一修船厂在解放以后虽然有很大进步，但是在相当长的时期内一直订不出生产计划来，工作陷于紊乱状态。许多陈旧的东西阻碍着生产的迅速发展。为了改变这种情况，马金城同志根据实际情况，运用苏联先进经验，进行生产组织和技术上的改革。他决定首先从改革会计工作着手。有些旧的会计人员反对改用新会计。马金城同志最初不谈改革会计制度，只把他在校中所学的“工业簿记核算”上的原理结合厂中实际情况简化为八个图表，用来说明全厂情况，指出厂中的会计的那些部分应该修订。由于他这样地把理论和每个人所熟悉的日常工作结合起来，教育会计人员，因此会计人员开始认识到改革会计工作的必要性。于是他就把几个有经验而又肯接受新事物的会计人员组织起来，成立了教研室。开办了小型会计训练班。他采用苏联马卡洛夫教授所编的课本为教材，从去年八月至十二月训练了三十多个新会计人员。依靠这三十多个人，建立了科学的新会计制度，基本上解决了该厂成本会计上所存在的问题。现在这三十多个人已经成了新港工程局改革会计工作的一批骨干。
    与此同时，修船厂又进行了统计工作的改革。过去该厂在统计工作中，不从实际情况出发，把货币指标机械地用来计算修理厂的劳动生产率，因而发生了实际工作量增多、劳动生产率反而降低的矛盾现象。为了建立正确的统计，马金城同志也从介绍苏联经验、培养干部着手，组织了统计教研室，并开办小型统计训练班，用苏联沙文斯基教授所著的“工业统计学教程”为教材，讲授一百四十多个小时，训练出二十多个新的统计人才。并且废弃了过去的错误指标，改用工时指标计算劳动生产率，正确地反映修船厂工作效率提高的情况。在这一基础之上，又制订了一套合理的统计报表。现在从厂长办公室所挂的一些统计图表上，可以一目了然地看出整个工厂工作的面貌。
    这两个教研室都是由业务上的领导干部当主任，自学之后负责讲授，由厂长兼任副主任，亲自辅导主讲教员。另外，并从业务较好、肯虚心学习新事物的人员中，聘请若干人担任实习教员。修船厂的经验证明：在生产企业中建立这样的教学组织，由领导同志亲自负责，结合实际情况，向业务技术人员系统传授苏联先进经验，训练干部，对于改进业务工作是非常有效的。
    马金城同志还帮助干部们学习了企业组织与计划和技术定额等课程，这样就为整顿生产组织准备了有利条件。在整顿生产组织中，把原来“职能制”的组织形式改变成为“生产区域制”，从而明确了责任，健全了生产管理，提高了工作效率。学习技术定额以后，大家对于挖潜力，就有了把握。工长们已经懂得：只要机器动作时间等于或大于手动时间，就可以进行多机床管理。
    生产计划问题，是修船厂过去始终没有解决的问题。因为修船厂是一个较复杂的大型修理厂。它没有固定的生产任务，而是为航运（修客轮和货轮）、工务（修挖泥船等）服务，临时突击工作很多。工作规模也很悬殊（如大至修万吨轮船，小至配钥匙）。几年来为了制订生产计划，曾想过不少办法，但始终没有成功。在一九五○年春天，甚至还有过一种意见，说“修船厂就是不可能订生产计划”。马金城同志在人民大学开始学企业组织与计划时，对于苏联经验能否用到修船厂去这个问题也不敢肯定。当他学了计划要“从后向前”订的原理以后，才体会到在修船厂也是有办法订计划的。回厂以后，他就积极地进行制定计划的工作。去年九月，第一次采用了“从后向前”的方法，制定了计划。例如修理一条船，先计划要求完工期限，确定最后一项工作是什么；如果最后一项工作是装大轴，那么就可确定钳工何时开始安装，机工何时可以车完，锻工和铸工又应在何时把它的附件螺丝和大瓦供给机工加工等等。这样一一分析，便可以有计划地、有步骤地进行这个复杂的修船工程，从而避免了等工现象。经试验成功后，他就把这方法应用到挖泥船大修工程上去，保证了冬季大修任务的完成，并创造了去年一冬修好六条挖泥船的新纪录。这一事例，教育了那些认为在修船厂不能订计划的人们。
    “三反”运动以后，修船厂提出了新的任务——推行定额，提高工作效率。马金城同志向大家传达了技术定额中研究潜力的三条原则：一、那些操作是不必要而可以取消的；二、那些操作是可以同时或交差进行的；三、那些操作在工作中最费时间，应如何缩短时间。这原是技术定额中的一般原理。现在，他把这个原理运用到整个一条船的修理工程上去。例如那时新港工程局有一条挖泥船出了毛病，搁在青岛。按照通常的步骤，修理这条船，要等船开到，检查坏的地方，然后设计、绘图、施工，一处修完再修一处，这样估计要四十五天才可修好。但他们运用了苏联先进经验，采取了革命的办法，迳直派人乘火车去青岛研究情况，画出草图，并将上述的原则和生产计划结合起来：首先，把全部工程项目列成清单，并把各项作业手续如拆卸、起重、搬运、机、钳、铆、焊等及所需的人数、时数等开列出来，审核和研究这些作业项目是否都必要。其次，研究那些作业或那些工程项目可同时进行或交差进行。最后，审查那一项作业和工程最费时间，研究如何集中力量来突击这一点，以缩短整个工程期限。他们把这方法称为“作业计划”。
    经过这样周密地分析和研究之后，全体工作人员对于整个修理过程的步骤，都能了解。于是按照计划，充分地准备了人力和器材，甚至连电话线也都挂好。船一靠上码头，十几分钟之内工人就开工修理，按原定计划分头并进。这样，过去需要四十五天的工程，只用了五十六个小时就完全修好了，创造了修船厂空前的纪录。在他们修理一只捷克大型货轮时，也应用这个方法，以半个月的时间完成了需时一个月的修船任务。这两项工作又是结合实际情况，灵活运用苏联经验的一个优秀范例。这种方法现在已经被普遍推广应用到建港期内抢修船只的工作中去。
    修船厂的另一件大事，就是举办“技工快速训练班”。去年修船厂因为生产规模扩充，需要增添大批技术工人，一时补充不上。按照过去的老办法，训练技术工人，起码要三年、五年。这个问题在马金城同志的脑中萦绕很久。他决定采用短期的速成的训练办法，来解决这个问题。他反复地向技术人员和技术工人说明短期速成训练工人的必要性和可能性，打通了他们的思想，并聘请他们担任教员。然后招收了一批高小或初中程度的青年，成立了训练班，采用上大课、实习、基本训练（即工厂实习，实际操作）等方法进行训练。上大课时，由技术人员讲授工厂数学、机械制图、机械原理等课程，并由技术工人带着这些学员进行工厂实习。学员们在两周以后，就可以做初步工作。六个月以后，在进行毕业考试时，百分之九十的学员都能及格。现在修船厂已训练出三批学员，不但解决了技术工人缺乏的问题，也提高了干部的业务水平。修船厂还开办了制图、基层干部、珠算、科（长）场（主任）级经济核算等训练班，都获得了成就。
    从马金城同志领导的修船厂的工作中，我们可以看到：只要能认真地学习苏联先进经验，把苏联经验和中国实际结合起来，就一定能改进和提高工厂的管理工作。
