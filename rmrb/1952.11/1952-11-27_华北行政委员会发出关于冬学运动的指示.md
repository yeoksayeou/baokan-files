    North China Administrative Committee Issues Instructions on Winter Study Movement
    The North China Administrative Committee of the Central People's Government's Government Administration Council issued instructions on the Winter Study Movement to the People's Governments of its affiliated provinces and cities on October 27th. The instructions emphasized that the tasks of the winter study program in North China this year are: first, to organize young and middle-aged farmers to participate in accelerated literacy programs to eliminate illiteracy; to select key areas in a planned manner and create various types of experiences to prepare for large-scale literacy campaigns in the future. Second, mobilize the broad masses of farmers to attend winter school and participate in current affairs and political studies to raise their ideological understanding. The instructions require leaders at all levels to devote sufficient effort to leading the winter study work, in addition to vigorously organizing accelerated literacy, and to prevent the tendency of focusing only on accelerated literacy while neglecting winter studies. The instructions pointed out that the winter study movement in the North China region has a history of more than ten years in the old base areas. In recent years, it has experienced even greater development. It has played a significant role and achieved remarkable results in raising the political awareness of the masses and disseminating production technology and hygiene knowledge. The winter study movement has become an extremely important part of the lives of the broad masses of farmers. The promotion of the accelerated literacy method has brought the cultural learning of farmers in North China into a new high tide; however, the accelerated literacy method can only be experimentally promoted in key areas this winter and cannot completely replace winter studies. In addition to a portion of young and middle-aged people participating in accelerated literacy learning, the cultural and political learning of the broad masses of farmers must still be grasped tightly. Even after the completion of accelerated literacy, civil schools must continue to carry out the consolidation and improvement of mass cultural learning.
    To this end, the instructions specifically require all localities to pay attention to the following points in conjunction with local specific circumstances:
    1. In addition to those participating in accelerated literacy, all farmers should be organized to participate in political classes and cultural classes as much as possible, on a voluntary basis, to carry out current affairs political education and cultural education in a planned manner. Teaching materials are to be compiled or selected by each province and city.
    2. According to the needs of farmers, education on agricultural production technology and hygiene knowledge can be appropriately carried out in conjunction with agricultural production summaries and the patriotic health campaign. This teaching material is to be organized, compiled or selected by rural health departments.
    3. Civil school students and winter school cultural classes who have not participated in accelerated literacy learning should participate in political learning in addition to cultural learning.
    4. Learning time: Current affairs political learning can be held twice every ten days according to rural customs. Cultural learning should in principle be about two hours a day. Farmers participating in accelerated literacy should also conduct current affairs political education once a month.
    5. The necessary funds, except for teacher training and reward subsidies, which are to be paid from the education expenditure and industrial and agricultural spare-time education expenses in the 1952 annual budget of each province (city), the kerosene, heating, office expenses and teacher subsidies for winter civil schools can be resolved according to the local financial regulations of each province (city), township (village) and town.
    The instructions estimate that farmers may universally demand to open accelerated literacy classes this winter, but due to insufficient teachers, teaching materials and teaching experience, it will not be possible to meet the needs of the masses. All localities should persuade the masses to attend winter school first and gradually participate in accelerated literacy. However, if the villages can solve the problems of teachers and teaching materials, and the masses urgently request to use accelerated literacy, they should also be given leadership. Even if the conditions are not yet available, if the masses must use the accelerated literacy method for teaching, they should be told the harm of "half-baked" and "relapse", lead according to their ability, and cannot firmly refuse.
    The instructions finally require each province (city) to make its own winter study plan according to the actual situation in its region. (Xinhua News Agency)

    华北行政委员会发出关于冬学运动的指示
    中央人民政府政务院华北行政委员会在十月二十七日向所属省、市人民政府发出关于冬学运动的指示。指示着重指出：华北今年冬学的任务，一是组织青壮年农民参加速成识字学习，扫除文盲；有计划地选取重点，创造各种不同类型的经验，为今后大规模扫除文盲作好准备工作。二是动员广大农民上冬学，参加时事政治学习，以提高思想认识。指示要求各级领导除用大力组织速成识字外，必须以足够力量领导冬学工作，防止只顾速成识字不管冬学的偏向。指示指出：华北区的冬学运动，在老根据地已有十多年历史。近几年来，又有更大的发展。它在提高群众政治觉悟、传播生产技术与卫生知识等方面，曾起了巨大的作用并已有显著成绩。冬季学习运动，已成为广大农民生活中极重要的部分。速成识字法的推行，使华北区农民文化学习又进入新的高潮；但速成识字法今冬只能重点实验重点推行，还不能完全代替冬学。除一部分青壮年参加速成识字学习外，广大农民的文化及政治学习仍须抓紧领导。即在速成识字完成以后，民校还须继续进行群众文化学习的巩固和提高工作。
    为此指示特要求各地结合当地具体情况，注意以下几点：
    一、除参加速成识字者外，所有农民在自愿原则下，尽可能组织他们参加政治班文化班，有计划地进行时事政治教育和文化教育。教材由各省市编写或选用。
    二、根据农民需要，可结合农业生产总结及爱国卫生运动适当进行农业生产技术及卫生常识的教育。此项教材由农村卫生部门组织编写或选辑。
    三、未参加速成识字学习的民校学员和冬学文化班，除一律参加文化学习外，仍应组织政治学习。
    四、学习时间：时事政治学习，可按农村习惯，每十天上课两次。文化学习原则上应每天学习两小时左右。参加速成识字的农民，每月也应进行一次时事政治教育。
    五、所需经费除师资训练、奖励补助由各省（市）一九五二年岁出预算内教育事业费工农业余教育费项下开支外，冬季民校灯油、烤火、办公费及教师之补贴等，可根据各省（市）乡（村）镇地方财政规定解决。
    指示估计今冬农民可能要求普遍开办速成识字班次，但因师资教材以及教学经验不足，不能满足群众要求，各地均应很好说服群众先上冬学，陆续参加速成识字。但如师资教材能够解决的村庄，群众迫切要求改用速成识字者亦应加以领导。即使条件尚未具备，群众一定要用速成识字法进行教学者，应向他们讲明“夹生”、“回生”的害处，量力领导，不能坚拒。
    指示最后要求各省（市）应根据本地区的实际情况，作出各省（市）的冬学计划。（新华社）
