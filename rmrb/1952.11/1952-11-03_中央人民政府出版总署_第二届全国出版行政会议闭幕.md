Central People's Government Publishing Administration
Second National Publishing Administrative Conference Concludes

The Central People's Government Publishing Administration held its Second National Publishing Administrative Conference from October 25th to 31st. Representatives from the news and publishing administrative organs of major administrative regions, provinces, and cities, representatives from state-owned and local state-owned news, publishing, distribution, and printing enterprises, as well as specially invited representatives from relevant central government organs attended the conference.

The conference was opened by Ye Shengtao, Deputy Director of the Publishing Administration, and Guo Moruo, Deputy Premier of the State Administration Council of the Central People's Government, was invited to give a political report.

Hu Yuzhi, Director of the Publishing Administration, delivered a report to the attending representatives entitled "Strive for Further Implementation of the Planning of Publishing Work." The report pointed out that publishing work had achieved great results in the past three years, basically meeting the needs of the country and the people, and fulfilling its due political responsibilities. The publishing industry itself has greatly developed. In terms of publishing administrative work, the specialization of publishing, distribution, and printing has been completed. However, there are still shortcomings in publishing work, the most important of which is that the work carries a lot of blindness, and human and material resources lack effective organization. This is reflected in: there are still serious shoddy work and waste in publications, and the books urgently needed by the majority of readers are not supplied in time; there are still inventory backlogs in state-owned bookstores, while readers in many places cannot buy or easily buy the books they need; in terms of printing, the printing tasks in some places and seasons are sometimes tight and sometimes loose. The reason for this disconnect and imbalance between supply and demand, in addition to some objective reasons, is that subjectively, state-owned publishing enterprises have not been able to completely get rid of the influence of bourgeois ideology in their work, and therefore there are purely task-oriented views, capitalist management methods, and bureaucratic work styles that are divorced from reality. The report pointed out that it is necessary to resolutely overcome this old capitalist management method and its ideological roots, and implement further planning in order to overcome the current degree of blindness in the work and enable the work to continue to move forward. In order to further implement the planning of publishing work, the report also pointed out that each publishing unit must investigate the needs of the country and the people, organize writing and translation forces, and formulate specific annual and quarterly publishing plans. Publishing houses should make it a regular and major task to organize external forces to engage in writing and translating books. In terms of distribution, it is necessary to follow the mass line, distribute books in a planned and organized manner through various mass organizations and business systems; and further implement the regular and fixed-amount distribution and book pre-order system.

The conference, based on the principle that cultural and educational work must serve the country's large-scale economic construction, cultivate various construction talents, and universally improve the people's cultural and political levels, determined that the future publishing policy is to give equal importance to popularization and improvement under the premise of further promoting planning. It also proposed a draft publishing construction plan for 1953.

The representatives attending the meeting had a full discussion for several days. On the 31st, Chen Kehan, Deputy Director of the Publishing Administration, gave a summary. The summary pointed out that through discussion, the representatives had a clear understanding of the planning of publishing work ideologically, which was a great gain. The representatives put forward some revised opinions on the draft publishing construction plan for 1953, making the plan closer to reality, and will be further revised in the future to make it a concrete and feasible plan. Finally, the representatives were asked to implement the spirit of this conference in their actual work and mobilize all staff members of each publishing unit to strive for the further realization of the planning of publishing work.

    中央人民政府出版总署
    第二届全国出版行政会议闭幕
    中央人民政府出版总署自十月二十五日到三十一日召开第二届全国出版行政会议。参加会议的有各大行政区、省、市新闻出版行政机关代表，国营和地方国营新闻、出版、发行、印刷企业代表，以及中央各有关机关的特邀代表。
    会议由出版总署副署长叶圣陶致开幕词，并邀请中央人民政府政务院副总理郭沫若作政治报告。
    出版总署署长胡愈之向到会代表作了“为进一步地实现出版工作的计划化而奋斗”的报告。报告指出：三年来，出版工作是有很大成绩的，基本上适应国家和人民的需要，并完成了应尽的政治责任。出版事业本身有了很大的发展。在出版行政工作方面完成了出版、发行、印刷专业分工等项主要工作。但是，出版工作还存在着缺点，最主要的是工作中带着不少盲目性，人力物力缺乏有效的组织。这表现在：出版物还存在着严重的粗制滥造和重复浪费现象，而广大读者所迫切需要的书籍，却没有及时供应；在国营书店中还有存货积压，而许多地方的读者却买不到或不容易买到所需要的书；在印刷方面，某些地方某些季节的印刷任务又有时紧时松现象。发生这种供需脱节和失调现象的原因，除了一些客观原因外，在主观上，是由于国营出版企业工作中还没有能够完全摆脱资产阶级思想的影响，因而存在着单纯任务观点、资本主义经营方式、以及脱离实际的官僚主义作风。报告指出：必须坚决地克服这种旧的资本主义的经营方式及其思想根源，实行进一步的计划化，才能克服目前工作中存在着的某种程度的盲目性，使工作继续前进。为进一步实行出版工作的计划化，报告并指出：各个出版单位均须调查国家和人民的需要，组织著作和翻译力量，并制定每年度和季度的具体出版计划。出版社要把组织社外力量从事著译书籍列为经常的主要任务之一。在发行工作方面要走群众路线，通过各种群众组织和业务系统有计划有组织地发行书籍；并进一步地实行定期定额发行和书刊预订制度。
    会议根据文化教育工作必须服务于国家大规模经济建设，培养各种建设人才，普遍提高人民的文化水平和政治水平的原则。确定今后的出版方针是在进一步推行计划化的前提下，做到普及与提高并重。并提出了一九五三年的出版建设计划草案。
    参加会议的代表们经过了几天时间的充分讨论。三十一日，由出版总署副署长陈克寒作总结。总结中指出：通过讨论，代表们对于出版工作计划化在思想上有了明确的认识，这是很大的收获。代表们对于一九五三年出版建设计划草案提出了一些修正的意见，使计划更加接近实际，以后再加修改。使它成为具体可行的计划。最后要求代表们把这次会议的精神贯彻到实际工作中去，动员各个出版单位的全体工作人员来为进一步实现出版工作的计划化而奋斗。    （新华社）
