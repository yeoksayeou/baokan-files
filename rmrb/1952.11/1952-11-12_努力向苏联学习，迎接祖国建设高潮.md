    Strive to Learn from the Soviet Union and Welcome the High Tide of National Construction
    Tian Demin, Chairman of the All-China Students' Federation
    November 7th this year marks the 35th anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution. As everyone knows, the Chinese revolution was carried out under the influence of the October Revolution. Under the guidance of Comrade Mao Zedong's thought, which combines Marxism-Leninism with the practice of the Chinese revolution, and with the assistance of the Soviet Union, the Chinese people's revolution achieved a great victory. In the three years since the founding of New China, our country has made brilliant achievements in all aspects of construction. Historical facts tell us that if we want revolution, we must learn from the Soviet Union; if we want construction, we must also learn from the Soviet Union. This is Chairman Mao's teaching that we should "follow the path of the Russians." Therefore, it is not difficult for us to understand how important it is for young students who are preparing for and will soon participate in the construction of the motherland to learn from the Soviet Union, especially at a time when a large-scale economic and cultural construction is about to begin.
    There are many things we need to learn from the Soviet Union, but there are several aspects that are particularly worth mentioning for us students.
    We must learn from the Soviet Union's advanced science and technology. The large-scale economic and cultural construction that our motherland is about to begin is aimed at gradually transforming our motherland from a backward agricultural country into an advanced industrial country. This great and arduous task requires thousands upon thousands of people who have mastered modern science and technology to undertake. However, our country is currently very short of such talents. Comrade Stalin said: "Doctors and economists, cooperative workers and teachers, mining technicians and statisticians, technicians and chemists, agronomists and road construction technicians, veterinary personnel and forestry personnel, electrical engineers and mechanical engineers - these talents are the leaders who will build a new society, build a socialist economy, and build a socialist culture in the future. Without new leading cadres, we cannot build a new society, just as we cannot build a new army without new generals." We students are about to be involved in the motherland's large-scale economic and cultural construction. Whether we can shoulder the tasks assigned to us by the motherland in the future depends on whether we can capture the fortress of science. Some people ask: "Why should we learn Soviet science and technology?" Our answer is: Because Soviet science and technology are based on Marxism-Leninism as their ideological foundation, it is not only the accumulation of rich experience in socialist construction for more than 30 years, but also concentrates and refines the essence of science and technology from all capitalist countries, so it is advanced, complete, and practical. In schools in our country that have already used Soviet textbooks, student performance has generally improved. This year, 80 percent of the students at Harbin University in Northeast China scored four or five, and the China Medical University has eliminated the phenomenon of scoring two. Students' understanding of the content and the improvement of their actual performance can also be seen from the work performance of students who have gone to work. For example, Ma Jincheng, a graduate of the first class of the Industrial Management Specialization at Renmin University of China, applied advanced Soviet experience to his work at the No. 1 Ship Repair Plant of the Tanggu New Port Engineering Bureau, and repaired a ship that was originally estimated to take 45 days in just over 50 hours. This example is just one of thousands, and achievements in the application of advanced Soviet science and technology in various construction projects such as industry, water conservancy, and railways in our country are even more emerging. All this fully demonstrates that Soviet science is advanced. To learn advanced Soviet science and technology, we must also master the tools for learning Soviet science and strive to learn Russian. Some students believe that they will not be translators, so it does not matter much whether they learn Russian well or not, so they do not study hard. This is wrong.
    The Soviet people and young students' selfless labor in the cause of building the motherland, their heroic and tenacious fighting in the Patriotic War, and their unremitting struggle in the cause of defending world peace have set a brilliant example for Chinese students. The heroic and exemplary deeds that have emerged in various struggles have widely influenced Chinese students. The glorious images of outstanding Soviet heroes Zoya, Matrosov, Oleg, and others are even more familiar, loved, and admired by Chinese students. Their noble qualities educate and inspire Chinese students to move forward.
    The brilliant achievements that the Soviet people and young students have made in the cause of building and defending the motherland are inseparable from their strong bodies and vigorous energy. We must be like Soviet youth, pay attention to physical health, and strive to exercise our physique, so that we can become the kind of person who, as Kalinin said, is "strong, agile, hardworking, able to withstand any test and able to overcome all difficulties."
    We must learn advanced Soviet science and technology, and we must learn the excellent revolutionary qualities of the Soviet people and young students. We must study Marxism-Leninism. We must know that advanced Soviet science and technology and the excellent revolutionary qualities of the Soviet people are cultivated under the guidance of Marxism-Leninism. The victory of the Chinese revolution was achieved under the guidance of Comrade Mao Zedong's thought, which combines Marxism-Leninism with the practice of the Chinese revolution. Therefore, learning advanced Soviet science and technology and studying Marxism-Leninism cannot be separated. Some people say: "Since the country needs scientific and technical talents, then we only need to study science and technology, why should we study politics?" This statement is obviously wrong. Stalin taught us: No matter what field of science you are an expert in, you should study Marxism-Leninism and participate in certain social and political activities, because only in that way can you become a politically minded person, wholeheartedly serve the people, make greater contributions to the construction of our great motherland, and become a talent needed by the motherland with high political awareness and mastery of science and technology.
    The great achievements of the Soviet Union in building socialism and communism have unfolded infinitely beautiful prospects for the people and students of our country. The friendly unity of the Chinese and Soviet people has powerfully defended world peace and accelerated the construction of our country. Chinese students are preparing with full confidence to welcome the high tide of the motherland's economic and cultural construction. Under the glorious illumination of the great victory of the October Socialist Revolution, and under the banner of Mao Zedong, we are striding forward towards the industrialization of the motherland and towards a bright socialist and communist future.

    努力向苏联学习，迎接祖国建设高潮
    中华全国学生联合会主席  田德民
    今年十一月七日是伟大的十月社会主义革命三十五周年纪念日。大家都知道，中国革命是在十月革命的影响下进行的。在毛泽东同志以马克思列宁主义和中国革命实践相结合的思想的指导下，在苏联的援助下，中国人民革命取得了伟大的胜利。新中国成立以来三年间，我们国家各方面建设都获得了辉煌的成就。历史事实告诉我们，我们要革命，就要学习苏联；我们要建设，也同样要学习苏联，这就是毛主席教导我们的“走俄国人的路”。因此，我们就不难理解，在祖国大规模经济建设、文化建设高潮即将到来的今天，对准备和即将参加祖国建设的青年学生来说，学习苏联是何等重要了。
    我们要向苏联学习的东西是很多的，但是对于我们学生来说，有几方面是值得特别提出来的。
    我们要学习苏联先进的科学和技术。我们祖国即将开始的大规模经济建设和文化建设，是要使我们祖国逐步地由落后的农业国变成先进的工业国。这个伟大而艰巨的任务，需要千千万万掌握现代化科学技术的人来担负。可是祖国目前是十分缺乏这样的人材的。斯大林同志说：“医生和经济学家、合作社工作人员和教师、采矿技师和统计学家、技术人员和化学人员、农业学家和筑路技师、兽医人员和造林人员、电气工程师和机械工程师——这些人材就是将来建设新的社会、建设社会主义经济和社会主义文化的领导者，没有新的领导干部就不能建设新的社会，正像没有新的将领，就不能建设新的军队是一样的。”我们学生即将投入祖国大规模的经济建设和文化建设，将来我们是否能担负起祖国交给我们的任务，就看我们是否能拿下科学的堡垒。有人问：“为什么要学习苏联的科学和技术呢？”我们的回答是：因为苏联的科学技术，是以马克思列宁主义为思想基础的，它不仅是三十多年社会主义建设丰富经验的积累，而且它集中提炼了一切资本主义国家科学技术的精华部分，所以它是先进的、完整的和切合实际的。在我国已经使用苏联教材的学校里，学生成绩普遍提高了。今年东北哈尔滨大学学生成绩四、五分的就占了百分之八十，中国医科大学已经消灭了二分的现象。学生们对学习内容的理解及真实成绩的提高，还可从走到工作岗位上的同学的工作成绩看得出来。例如中国人民大学专修科工管班第一期毕业同学马金城，在塘沽新港工程局第一修船厂工作中，将苏联先进经验应用到实际工作中去，使原来估计要四十五天才可能修好的船在五十几小时内就修好了。这个例子不过是千千万万个例子之一，而在我国工业、水利、铁路等各方面建设工作中，使用苏联先进科学技术的成就，更是层出不穷。这一切，充分地说明了苏联科学是先进的。要学习苏联先进的科学技术，还要掌握学习苏联科学的工具，要努力学习俄文。有的同学认为自己不当翻译，俄文学得好坏关系不大，因此不认真学习，这是不对的。
    苏联人民和青年学生在建设祖国事业中忘我的劳动，在卫国战争中英勇顽强的战斗，在保卫世界和平事业中坚持不懈的奋斗，给中国学生树立了光辉的榜样。在各个斗争中层出不穷的英雄模范事迹，广泛地影响着中国学生。杰出的苏联英雄卓娅、马特洛索夫、奥列格等光辉的形象，更是中国学生熟悉的、热爱的和崇敬的。他们崇高的品质，教育和鼓舞着中国学生前进。
    苏联人民和青年学生在建设祖国与保卫祖国事业中获得的辉煌成就，是和他们具有强健的身体和旺盛的精力分不开的。我们要像苏联青年那样，注意身体健康，努力锻炼体魄，使自己成为如同加里宁所说的那种“强壮的、精敏的、刻苦耐劳的、能够经受任何考验和能够克服一切困难的人”。
    我们要学习苏联先进的科学和技术，我们要学习苏联人民和青年学生的优秀的革命品质，必须学习马克思列宁主义。我们要知道，苏联先进的科学技术，苏联人民优秀的革命品质，是在马克思列宁主义指导下培养起来的。中国革命的胜利，是在毛泽东同志的以马克思列宁主义与中国革命实践相结合的思想指导下获得的。所以学习苏联先进的科学和技术，和学习马克思列宁主义是不能分开的。有人说：“既然国家需要科学技术人材，那我们只学习科学技术就是了，何必去学政治呢？”这种说法显然是不对的。斯大林教导我们：不论你是那一门科学的专家，你都应该学习马克思列宁主义和参加一定的社会政治活动，因为只有那样，你才能成为有政治头脑的人，才能全心全意为人民服务，对建设我们伟大祖国才会有更大的贡献，而成为祖国需要的具有高度政治觉悟和掌握科学技术的人材。
    苏联建设社会主义和共产主义的伟大成就，给我国人民和学生展开了无限美好的前途。中苏两国人民的友好团结，有力地保卫了世界和平和加速了我国的建设。中国学生正满怀信心地准备迎接祖国的经济建设和文化建设高潮，在伟大的十月社会主义革命胜利的光辉照耀下，在毛泽东的旗帜下，向着祖国的工业化、向着美好的社会主义和共产主义前途大踏步前进。    （新华社）
