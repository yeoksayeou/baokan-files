    Discussing Realism in Chinese Opera Performance Art
    A Jia

    This National Opera Performance Exhibition has launched a friendly competition among various opera genres, which has positive and significant implications for the reform and development of opera art in the future. Among the opera reform efforts, the most difficult to solve, with the least experience, is the reform of performance art. Without a good solution to this problem, even the best dramatic and literary scripts cannot become excellent theater art. Stanislavski's belief that the formalistic approach to the art of performance must be completely overcome in order to stage Chekhov's "The Seagull" effectively fully proves this point.

    China's opera heritage is extremely rich. Because it reflects real life and is a creation of the people, it has a certain democratic nature in its ideology, and it also demonstrates the spirit of realism in its art. However, ever since local opera (including folk opera) was plagiarized by the scholar-official class and brought into the halls of power, it has been augmented with feudal ideological content and has lost its original, simple, realistic performance methods. In feudal society, not only were people's positions and status divided into ranks, but also their personalities and character. The categorization of roles in old operas – sheng, dan, jing, mo, chou – reflects this ranking of people. For example, "sheng" is a generalization of the expression of the scholar-official class, while "chou" is often a generalization of the expression of the working people. These artistic creations are inseparable from feudal concepts, and they are also one of the causes of formalism.

    Another reason is that parasitic scholar-official class, in their appreciation of art, often did not pay attention to the actual content of life but pursued abstract formal beauty, believing that beauty should be detached from reality and have its own independent realm. Therefore, opera art was not intended to represent real life, but merely used some life materials to express performance techniques. The formalism of Peking Opera was cultivated by this kind of aesthetic thought. Their interest was not in watching the play but in listening to the singing with their eyes closed; the standard of singing was not based on the requirements of thought and emotion but solely on the requirements of phonetics and tunes. The words in the play could be nonsensical (such as "Bringing my body to the Lotus Treasure," "Leading the horse into battle with my lord," etc.), but the "flavor" had to be right. The same was true for watching the performance: it was not about watching the collaboration of the whole play but about watching the technical performance of one or two characters. The overall movements and emotions could be unrelated, but certain prescribed gestures could not be omitted (“beautiful” movements such as sleeve movements, beard movements, exit stances, etc.). They wanted to talk about artistic "detachment," "elegance," "scholarly air," even to the point of demanding to get rid of all “human qualities,” and then it would be considered "consummate." Many Peking Opera actors, influenced by these ideas, fell into wrong conceptions about opera performance (some were also influenced by the vulgar tastes of the petty bourgeoisie), creating a serious tendency towards formalism in their creative methods. "Ganlu Temple" in the performance was a prominent example.

    Starting from form alone, without drawing from life experiences, results in emphasizing the completeness of art in theory and emphasizing the conservatism of acting skills in practice, the so-called following fixed rules. Otherwise, it would damage the "beauty," that is, destroy the rigor and completeness of the art of performance. This theory should be criticized.

    In Peking Opera and local operas, there are many actors who create roles with a realistic spirit. When they talk about performance, they emphasize "being reasonable and logical," "resembling a dragon when playing a dragon, resembling a tiger when playing a tiger," "no two identical performances on the stage," etc. They require being lively and vigorous on the stage, not getting rid of all human qualities; they require "acting as if it were real," "both beautiful and natural," not abstractly talking about what is "consummate." Mr. Mei Lanfang is such an example. In "Drunken Concubine," performed at the conference, because he could delve into the character's life, his dance movements and facial expressions everywhere reflected the melancholy and worry of court life. The main reason his performance was different from that of others was that it started from the experience of life, not from the adoption of routines.

    Mr. Zhou Xinfang's performance of the "Xu Ce Runs the City" excerpt was the same. The "Gaobozi" section he sang after ascending the city wall, from the trembling of his head and neck, the vibration of his fingers, the gaze of his eyes, the flaring of his nostrils, and the vibrating power of his whole body, these thoughtful movements and expressions gave the singing a full emotion. He spat out each word from his mouth, asking in detail the origins and family history of the young hero without complaint. It made us see how Old Xu Ce cared about the growth of the Xue family's descendants and how excited he was for the Xue family's revenge. We were attracted by these moving performances, and the appreciation of rhythm and melody became secondary.

    The "Yandang Mountain" performed by Mr. Xu Juhua and others in Northeast China was the same. This martial arts play was not just about cleanly executed targets and beautifully performed somersaults. The main thing was to give these special martial arts techniques the life of performance art, giving it performance content. Originally, in martial arts plays, such things as continuous chains, parrying, target practice, and various somersaults were often divorced from the plot. They could be expanded, contracted, increased, or decreased at will, or they could be "the Eight Immortals crossing the sea," each showing their unique abilities. "Yandang Mountain" was different. It gave various martial arts routines and various dance movements a reasonable combination based on the plot. It used the tunes of Suona music like "Huanglong Gun" and "Zhegui Ling" as a substitute for the character's language singing (whether it is appropriate to use tunes to replace singing in the nature of a dance drama still needs to be studied). The entire performance was performed as a dance drama. It expressed the invincibility of the people's insurgent army in historical themes with extremely clear and enthusiastic emotions, such as climbing over mountains, jumping over city walls, seizing fortresses, encircling and annihilating the enemy, and erecting banners, all of which were very moving, closely connected, and carried through to the end. (There were also shortcomings in individual places, such as Meng Haigong's use of the "Picking the Chariot" segment where Gao Chong was pulled on a horse, which was not very appropriate, because Gao Chong was showing his exhaustion after pulling the chariot, while Meng Haigong was just coming out of battle and should have had a different kind of spirit. The facial expressions on the faces of the general soldiers were also not enough.) The naval battle scene was particularly wonderful. It used the special techniques of turning, tumbling, falling, and pouncing from martial arts to express the thrilling nature of the naval battle, truly creating a sense of overturning rivers and seas. These performances were beautiful, and at the same time, they were realistic and rigorous. This illustrates a successful example of how to reform martial arts plays. The main method is to start from the experience of the plot, not from the abstract beauty or the adoption of old routines.

    I have not seen all the Peking Opera programs in the conference. The examples above mainly want to illustrate our attitude towards technology. With deep technical skills, if you do not experience life in performance, you will not be able to give the performance thought, and you will not be able to understand what is the essence and what is the dross, and you will easily go down the road of formalism.

    The realistic style of performance can be seen from the outstanding achievements of various local opera performances. There are many examples. I will only cite Mr. Chen Bohua's "Cosmic Frontier" in Han Opera to illustrate this problem:

    The script of this performance of Han Opera's "Cosmic Frontier" is basically the same as that of Peking Opera's "Cosmic Frontier." The rules of enunciation are also basically the same. According to Chen Bohua's own introduction, her current singing of "Cosmic Frontier" is basically Han Opera, but it has absorbed the techniques of Peking Opera. The reason why her "Cosmic Frontier" is performed so well is that she has grasped the essence in experiencing the character's thoughts. She once talked to us about the following points:

    (1) It is not easy for Zhao Yanrong to pretend to be crazy to deceive this old and cunning father. Only by treating her father as a son or a husband can she pretend well, but doing so is a sin. How can she be worthy of her old man? But it has to be this way. If you think of hating your father and suffering for yourself, there will be a lot of drama.

    (2) Pretending to be crazy in front of her father is enough as long as she can be trusted. Pretending to be crazy in the Jinluan Hall is not a joke. If the emperor sees through it, she will either be forced to marry or be killed. Even if he doesn't see through it, she may still be in danger. So she has to be prepared to die. At this time, her courage is different from when she pretends to be crazy at home.

    (3) Although she is not afraid of death when pretending to be crazy in the Jinluan Hall, she is not looking for death. She must try to find a way not to die everywhere. It is not appropriate to scold the fatuous king as rationally as in Peking Opera. For example, "...Thinking of the late king when he was alive, he conquered the East China Sea, built the Afang Palace in the west, repaired the Five Ridges in the south, and built the Great Wall of ten thousand miles in the north. I really hoped that the country would last for generations. Who would have thought that you, the fatuous king, were greedy for pleasure and lustful; I think this world belongs to everyone, not to one person, and only the virtuous live in it. If you are so licentious and immoral, I am afraid that the country may not last long." (Excerpt from Peking Opera "Cosmic Frontier," this passage is not in Han Opera). Wouldn't such a passage make Qin Ershi see the flaws? But Zhao Yanrong was indeed extremely angry at this time, and she really wanted to scold him in front of the fatuous king even at the cost of death. Here, she wants to scold but dare not scold. The play is very complicated to perform.

    Chen Bohua grasped the character's train of thought. Adding her proficient technique, she performed Zhao Yanrong's conflict with Zhao Gao little by little in the situation stipulated in the play. Zhao Yanrong's determination not to marry the emperor, from opposing her father head-on to pretending to be crazy to oppose her father, this psychological process is complex and extremely painful. She clenched her teeth, opened her five fingers (not in the shape of an orchid), and scratched her face severely. As her emotions developed to this point, she was really a bit like being mad. The psychological process from hesitation, pain, to determination to do it is concentratedly expressed in her fingers, eyes, and expressions that imply each other to the wet nurse. Zhao Yanrong's destruction of her own appearance showed her determination to fight Zhao Gao to the end. Only in this way could she break Zhao Gao's fantasy. The play is at its climax here.

    Zhao Yanrong, who was originally half-mad with anger, thought carefully that a frontal conflict was not the way. At this time, since Zhao Gao said she was crazy, she might as well take this opportunity to pretend to be crazy and ease the useless frontal conflict and turn to a side battle. At this time, the thoughts and feelings that Chen Bohua performed Zhao Yanrong’s was transformed from excitement to deepness; she sat on the ground, unwilling to get up, on the one hand, she was thinking about how to pretend to be crazy, and on the other hand, she was expressing the fatigue after the extreme excitement.

    Zhao's daughter sings: Saying that I am crazy, I have to be flexible,
    Sitting in the dust, I talk nonsense.
    Zhao Gao: You (call the wet nurse) help her up! (The dumb
    Wants Zhao Gao to help, to be personally confirmed by Zhao Gao.)
    Help her up! (Then help her up)
    Zhao Nv: Aiya...Aiya...The Prime Minister's Office is boring, I want to go
    Heaven! Go to heaven! Go to heaven! Ha...Aiya, heaven is also
    Boring, I want to go underground! I want to go underground! Ha...
    Hey! You are my son.

    When Chen Bohua performed here, the actions and moods seemed relaxed, and she felt that this matter could be dealt with in a playful and scolding attitude. (This is one side, the side of enduring pain is not expressed.)

    Zhao Gao recognized his daughter as a madman, which meant that Zhao Yanrong had achieved her goal. From the perspective of the struggle, it can be considered that she had won a little initiative. Chen Bohua understands the character of the characters in the play very well. She performs that Zhao Yanrong has no experience in pretending to be crazy, so she exaggerates the style of "crazy", standing up straight, advancing like a wave to Zhao Gao. (This action is very coordinated with the melody of "Fan Er Huang".) The experienced wet nurse, saw that Miss Zhao's madness was not real and could not hide it from the old and cunning Zhao Gao. If it was to be done realistically, she could only treat her father as her husband. Zhao Yanrong's play entered a higher stage from here. The serious ethical concepts and the requirements of pretending to be crazy, this contradiction was placed in front of Miss Zhao and could not be resolved: she felt that this kind of rebellious analogy was a serious sin, and her conscience was severely condemned. In order to be really crazy, she had to do so.

    These complex emotions were reflected in front of the wet nurse. Chen Bohua and Mr. Wan Xianxia, who played the wet nurse, both performed very well. In the development of the drama, there was another climax. After this climax, the progress of the play flowed down smoothly.

    Zhao's daughter sings: Suddenly opening my eyes and looking around,
    Seeing many resentful ghosts standing in front of me.
    Ox-headed and horse-faced men came again in the air,
    The Jade Emperor drove auspicious clouds to pick me up to heaven.

    In the previous plot, the danger of pretending to be crazy has passed. Although Zhao Yanrong sees gods and ghosts here, there are no new changes in the plot; Chen Bohua did not emphasize the horror of these gods and ghosts, which is correct. Especially the smart and alert wet nurse, fearing that Miss Zhao would pretend too much, stopped in moderation, and quickly withdrew her off the stage. These performances are all reasonable and logical.

    Pretending to be crazy in the Jinluan Hall is a new development of the play. The conflict shifted from Zhao Gao to Qin Ershi. How to observe Qin Wang's attitude to correct his attitude at the first meeting is the content of the struggle. Chen Bohua's experience of this point is also profound.

    Zhao Nu: Hey! Emperor, students salute, please...Hey! Ha...
    Congratulations on your fortune.…

    She bowed politely to Qin Ershi. After discovering that Qin Ershi had no disgust for her, she changed her posture and bowed again, deliberately provoking the other party's antipathy to prove that she was a madman. Since then, the development of the play has always been expressed in these two conflicts, that is: Qin Ershi threatened her, and she resisted desperately, even breaking down and scolding her. This scolding was righteous and rational; but she was always careful and vigilant, and until she was about to die, she always used her madness to cover up her true face. Chen Bohua has always grasped this ideological contradiction to perform.

    Zhao's daughter sings: Qin Ershi sits in the country, the national law is in chaos,
    Discovering that his words are too direct and his emotions are too impulsive, he has to change his attitude. If you can pretend to be crazy, you still have to pretend to the end.
    Continue singing: Wearing a pair of Dengyun shoes, follow me to heaven.

    Qin Ershi had no choice but to drive her out of Jinluan Hall. Zhao Yanrong won the battle in Jinluan Hall, and she also suffered enough grievances. When she left Jinluan Hall, she unconsciously revealed her father-daughter affection in front of her father and shouted "Daddy!" She immediately realized this mistake and then scolded "Old dog", "My son is frightened!" and then pretended to be crazy again. The smart and kind wet nurse pushed her, hinting to leave quickly; when Zhao Yanrong saw her most caring relative, she could no longer restrain her emotions and burst into tears, and the wet nurse pulled her away. The play is over.

    Chen Bohua's "Cosmic Frontier" also has shortcomings, and the emotions in the singing are not enough, which is still worth studying.

    The scripts and performance art of various local operas had many outstanding performances in this conference, and they will not be listed here. This creative method of deeply and specifically experiencing the character's thoughts is the realistic method that we should learn.

    Peking Opera's technical training has a better foundation than other opera genres, and the depth of processing is also different; it should be required to reflect the content of life more highly concentrated, so it is necessary to oppose the formalistic creative methods and learn the realistic creative methods. Otherwise, it is impossible to make Peking Opera a new national opera.

    谈我国戏曲表演艺术里的现实主义
    阿甲
    这次全国戏曲会演，展开了各剧种的友谊竞赛，对今后戏曲艺术的改革和发展，有积极的、重要的意义。戏曲改革工作中困难较多、经验较少、最不容易解决的是表演艺术的改革问题。这一问题不求得很好的解决，即使戏剧性、文学性再好的剧本，也不能成为很好的剧场艺术。史坦尼斯拉夫斯基认为必须彻底克服表演艺术上的形式主义，始能排好契诃夫的“海鸥”，就充分地证明了这一点。
    我国戏曲遗产极为丰富，由于它反映现实生活，是人民的创造，思想上就有一定的民主性，艺术上也表现了现实主义的精神。可是，自从地方戏曲
    （包括民间戏曲）为士大夫阶级所剽窃、搬进庙堂之后，就增加了封建的思想内容，和损失了原来的朴素的现实主义表演方法。封建社会，不仅将人的地位身份分成等级，人格、品性也被分成等级；旧戏中的生、旦、净、末、丑，每一种角色的分类，就反映了人格的分等。例如：“生”是士大夫阶级表现形式的概括，“丑”往往是劳动人民表现形式的概括。这些艺术创造和封建观念分不开，也是产生形式主义的原因之一。
    另一种原因是那些寄生的士大夫阶级，他们对于艺术的欣赏，往往不注意实际的生活内容，而是追求抽象的形式美；认为美应该撇开真实，有自己独立的境界。因此戏曲艺术，便不是为了表现现实生活，不过是借一点生活材料，表现表现技术罢了。京戏的形式主义，便是由这种美学思想培养起来的。他们的趣味，不是讲究看戏，而是讲究闭眼听唱；唱的标准，不是根据思想情感的要求，而是孤立地根据音韵的、腔调的要求；戏中词句尽可不通（如“将身来在莲花宝”，“与爷带过马走战”等），“味儿”不可不讲。看表演也是一样，不是看整个戏的合作，而是看一两个角色的技术表演，整个的动作情绪可以无联系，几个规定的身段不可不“漂亮”（如耍袖、耍髯、下场势等）。他们要讲艺术上的“超脱”、“雅致”、“书卷气”、直到要求脱尽“人烟气”，那就“炉火纯青”了。好些京剧演员，因受了这些影响，对戏曲表演的认识，陷于错误的观念（也有受小市民的庸俗趣味的影响的），在创作方法上，造成严重的形式主义的倾向。会演中“甘露寺”是一个突出的例子。
    不从生活的体验出发，单从形式出发，就形成在理论上强调艺术的完整性，在实践上强调演技的保守性，所谓循一定之规。不如此，就会损害了“美”，也就是破坏了表演艺术的谨严与完整。这种理论是应该批判的。
    京戏和地方戏中都有不少的演员以现实主义的精神来创作角色的，他们谈表演，讲究“入情入理”、“装龙像龙，装虎像虎”、“一台无二戏”……等等。要求在舞台上如生龙活虎，不是要做到没有人烟气；要求“假戏真做”，“又要好看，又要自然”，不是抽象地讲什么“炉火纯青”。梅兰芳先生就是如此。他在会演中所演“醉酒”，因能深入角色的生活，她那些舞蹈动作和面部表情，处处反映出宫廷生活的忧郁烦恼。他的表演所以不同于其他人所演，主要是从生活的体会出发，而不是程式的袭用。
    周信芳先生表演“徐策跑城”的一节也是如此的。他上城之后唱的一段“高拨子”，从他那头颈的颤动，手指的震荡，目光凝视，鼻翅张开以及浑身带有弹性的那种震动的力量，这些有思想的动作表情，使唱有了饱满的情绪。他一个字一个字从嘴里迸发出来，不嫌烦琐地查问那小英雄的家世和来因。使我们看到老徐策如何关心薛家后代英雄的成长，为薛家的复仇而激奋。我们被这些动人的演唱所吸引，板眼、腔调的欣赏，成为次要的东西。
    东北徐菊华先生等排演的“雁荡山”，也是如此的。这个武戏，不只是靶子打得干净，筋斗翻得漂亮，主要的是把这些特殊的武技，赋予了表演艺术的生命，使它有了表演的内容。原来武戏里如开连环、打挡子、打靶子、以及各式各样的筋斗，往往是脱离剧情的。它可以随便伸缩增减，也可以“八仙过海”，各显奇能。“雁荡山”则不然，它使各种武打套子、各种舞蹈动作，根据剧情给以合理的组合；将黄龙滚、折桂令等那些吹打曲牌作为人物语言歌唱的代替（用曲牌代替唱，在舞剧的性质上是否合适，尚须研究），整个的表演当作舞剧来演出，它以极其鲜明热烈的情调，表现历史题材中人民起义军的英勇无敌，如爬山越岭、跳越城墙、抢夺要塞、围歼敌人、竖立纛旗等都很动人，紧紧衔接，贯串到底。（个别地方也有缺点的，如孟海公搬用“挑滑车”高冲的一段马舞不大合适，因高冲是表现挑车后的精疲力竭，而孟海公还是刚刚出阵，应是另一种气概。一般将士面部上的表情也还不够。）水战一场，特别精彩。它把武功里翻、腾、跌、扑那些特殊技术，表现水战的惊险，真有翻江搅海之势。这些表演是美的，同时是有真实感的，也是谨严的。这说明了如何改革武戏的一个成功的范例。主要的方法，是从剧情的体验出发，不是从抽象的美、旧套的袭用出发。
    会演中的京戏剧目，我没有全部看过。以上所举例子，主要的想说明我们对待技术的态度。有了深厚的技术功夫，在表演上如不从生活去体验，就无法使表演有思想，也无法理解哪些东西是精华，哪些东西是糟粕，就很容易走向形式主义的道路。
    表演上现实主义的作风，从各种地方戏的演出中都看出它显著的成绩来。例子很多，我只举汉剧中陈伯华先生的“宇宙锋”来说明这个问题：
    这一次演出的汉剧“宇宙锋”，和京戏“宇宙锋”的剧本，基本上是相同的。咬字的规律基本上也是相同的。据陈伯华自己介绍，她现在唱的“宇宙锋”，基本上是汉剧的，但吸收了京戏的技术。她的“宇宙锋”所以演得好，是她在体验人物思想方面，抓住了要害。她曾和我们谈到这样几点：
    （一）赵艳蓉装疯想骗过这个老奸巨滑的父亲，是不容易的。只有把父亲当儿子、当丈夫来看待才装得像，但这样做是一种罪过，如何对得起他老人家呢？可是非如此不可。这里恨父亲、苦自己，这样去想，戏就很多。
    （二）在父亲面前装疯，只要信得过就够了。金殿装疯，可不是闹着玩的。被皇帝识穿了，不是强娶，就是被杀。即使识不穿，也可能有性命之忧。因此就得有死的打算。这时她的气魄，和在家装疯就不一样。
    （三）金殿装疯虽不怕死，但不是找死，处处要想法不死。像京戏那样骂昏王骂得那么有道理是不合适的。如“……想先王在世，东平大海，西建阿房，南修五岭，北造万里长城。实指望江山万代。谁想你这昏王，贪淫好色；我想这天下，乃人人之天下，非一人之天下，惟有德者居之。似你这样荒淫无道，只怕江山未必长久哇。”（节录京剧宇宙锋，汉戏里没有这一段戏词）。这样一段话，岂不使秦二世看出破绽。可是赵艳容这时的确万分气愤，真想不惜一死，当着昏王痛骂一场。这里又想骂，又不敢骂，戏很复杂难做。
    陈伯华掌握了人物的思想线索，加上她熟练的技术，在戏规定的情境中，将赵艳容和赵高的冲突，一点一滴地表演出来。赵艳容坚决不嫁皇帝，从正面反对她父亲进而到装疯反对她父亲，这一个心理过程是复杂的，也是极痛苦的。她咬紧牙关，张开五指（不是兰花形的），狠狠抓破自己的脸皮。情绪发展到这里，真有点如癫如狂了。从犹豫、痛苦、直到坚决要干的心理过程，集中地表现在她的手指上、眼神上、和哑乳娘互相暗示的表情上。赵艳蓉毁坏自己的容颜，表示了和赵高斗争到底的决心，非如此不足以打破赵高的幻想。戏到这里，是一个高潮。
    性格倔强的赵艳蓉，本来气得半疯了。仔细一想，正面冲突不是办法。此时赵高既说是疯，正好乘此装疯一番，把无济于事的正面冲突缓和下来，转向侧面的斗争。此时陈伯华所表演赵艳蓉的思想感情，从激动转到深沉；她坐在地上，不肯起来，一面是捉摸如何装疯，一面是表现情绪极度激动后的疲乏。
    赵女唱：说我疯我只得随机应变，
    坐至在尘埃地信口胡言。
    赵高：你（叫哑乳娘）把她扶了起来！（哑奴
    要赵高去扶，要赵高亲自得到证明。）
    你把她扶了起来！（然后扶起）
    赵女：哎哈…哎…相府冷落不好玩，我要上
    天！上天！上天啦！哈…哎呀，天上也
    不好玩，我要入地！要入地呀！哈…
    喂！你是我的儿呀。
    陈伯华表演到这里，动作情调，都显得轻松，觉得这件事可以用嬉笑怒骂的态度来处理之。（这是一面，隐忍苦痛的一面没有表现出来。）
    赵高把女儿认成疯魔，在赵艳蓉说来是达到了目的。从斗争来看，也算争取了一点主动。陈伯华很理会剧中人的性格，她表演赵艳蓉没有装疯的经验，就夸张了“疯”的式样，挺着身子，像浪潮似的向赵高面前挺进。（这种动作，和“反二簧”的旋律配合得非常调协。）有丰富经验的哑乳娘，她看到赵小姐的疯态不真实，瞒不过老奸巨滑的赵高，如要做得真实，只有把父亲当作丈夫来看待。赵艳蓉的戏，从这里就进入更高的阶段。严肃的伦理观念和装疯的要求，这个矛盾摆在赵小姐的面前不能解决：她感到这一种叛伦的比拟，是深重的罪恶，良心上受到严重的责备，为了要疯得真，不得不如此做。
    这些复杂的感情，都反映在哑乳娘的面前。陈伯华和扮演哑乳娘的万仙霞先生都表演得很好。在戏剧性的发展上，又是一个高潮。过了这个高潮，戏的进行，就顺流无阻地流泻下去了。
    赵女唱：猛然间睁开眼四下观看，
    见许多怨魂鬼站在面前。
    半空中又来了牛头马面，
    玉皇爷驾祥云接我上天。
    在上一段情节里，装疯的危险已经过去，这里虽表现赵艳蓉见神见鬼，在情节上并没有新的变化；陈伯华也并没有强调渲染这些神鬼的恐惧形象，这是对的。特别是聪明机警的哑乳娘，生怕赵小姐装得过火，当适可而止，就赶紧收兵，将赵小姐拉下场去。这些表演都是入情入理的。
    金殿装疯，是戏的新的发展。从对赵高的冲突转换到对秦二世的冲突。初见面时如何观察秦王的态度以修正自己的态度，是斗争的内容。陈伯华对这点的体验也是深刻的。
    赵女：喂！皇帝老爷，生员礼到，请了……咦！哈……
    恭喜你发财。……
    她斯斯文文地向秦二世打了一恭，发现秦二世对自己无厌恶之感，随又改变姿势，重打一恭，故意惹对方反感，以证明她是疯魔。此后戏的发展，一直表现在这两种冲突之中，即是：秦二世威胁她，她拚死反抗，不惜破口痛骂，这个骂是正义的，理智的；但又处处留心警惕，不到非死不可之时，总是要把疯态来掩护自己的真面目。陈伯华就是一直掌握了这种思想矛盾来表演的。
    赵女唱：秦二世坐江山国法大乱，
    发现自己的话太直率了，情感太冲动，不得不转变态度。能够装疯，还是要装到底。
    接唱：穿一双登云鞋随我上天。
    秦二世无可奈何，把她赶出金殿算数。赵艳蓉金殿斗争胜利了，委屈也受够了。当她出金殿时，在父亲的面前不自觉地流露一下父女的感情，喊了一声“爹爹！”她马上发觉这个错误，接着骂了一声“老狗”，“我的儿吓！”又装起疯来。聪明善良的哑乳娘，推了她一下，暗示快走；赵艳蓉一见最关切的亲人，再也抑制不住情感，放声要哭，哑乳娘拉了就走。戏就结束了。
    陈伯华的“宇宙锋”，也还是有缺点的，歌唱的情感就很不够，这还值得研究。
    各种地方戏的剧本和表演艺术，在这次会演中，有不少是非常出色的，这里不一一举例。这样深刻具体体会人物思想的创作方法，是我们应当学习的现实主义的方法。
    京戏的技术训练，比其他剧种更有基础，加工的深度也不同；应该要求它更能高度集中地反映生活内容，因此必须反对形式主义的创作方法，学习现实主义的创作方法。不然，就不可能使京戏成为民族的新戏曲。
