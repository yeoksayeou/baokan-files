    All Leaders and People of the Qinghai Henan Mongol Autonomous Region
    Unite Under the Banner of Chairman Mao to Strive for the Construction of the Motherland
    Respected Chairman Mao: In late summer this year, the Northwest Military and Political Committee Qingnan Pastoral Area Visiting Group and the CPC Qinghai Province Henan Mongol Autonomous Region Working Committee came to our Henan Mongol Autonomous Region. After two months of propaganda and work, we truly realized that you are the savior of all ethnic groups. Only under your banner can our minority nationalities develop and advance. In order to strengthen unity, we convened the All-Region Leaders and People Solidarity Conference on October 20th. We are determined to follow your instructions, unite, resolutely eliminate the remnants of the Chiang Kai-shek and Ma Bufang bandit gangs, safeguard local public security, develop production, and work together with all ethnic groups in the country to build the motherland, to repay your infinite love and concern for us.
    The All-Region Leaders and People Solidarity Conference of Qinghai Province Henan Mongol Autonomous Region
