Xinhua News Agency dispatch:

    The American ruling clique is using fascist methods to persecute the American representatives attending the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference. According to the American International News Service, the U.S. government issued a so-called "worldwide" warrant on the 16th to arrest and interrogate all American representatives who attended the Peace Conference. The U.S. State Department has notified all U.S. ports of entry and ordered U.S. embassies around the world to arrest American peace representatives returning to the United States or on their way home and to revoke their passports. This incident shows that the great success of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference has greatly alarmed the bellicose American rulers. The *New York Times* said in an editorial on October 7th: "It would be a mistake to think that this conference is not important." This newspaper shouted on October 13th that this conference was a "challenge" to the United States and demanded that the United States "meet it with all its strength." However, the American ruling clique's conspiracy to prevent American representatives from attending the conference in Beijing before the meeting has failed, and its attempt to suppress the peace movement with terror will inevitably fail.
    The reactionary government of Thailand's Plaek Phibunsongkhram is launching a large-scale movement to suppress domestic peace forces. Thai police authorities have been making large-scale arrests since the night of the 9th. According to an Associated Press dispatch from Bangkok on the 12th, Thai police have arrested more than 200 people, including Nai Charoon Suksawat, chairman of the Thai Peace Committee. Other reports say that Thai police authorities are planning to arrest more than 500 people. The National Assembly, controlled by Plaek Phibunsongkhram, also passed a fascist law on the 13th to further persecute people who demand peace. According to this law, the reactionary ruling authorities can arbitrarily accuse people who demand peace of so-called "communist activities" and sentence them to five years in prison or life imprisonment.
    In order to cover up these atrocities, the Plaek Phibunsongkhram government has fabricated an absurd excuse, saying that these measures were taken because of the discovery of a so-called "conspiracy to overthrow the current Thai government." According to United Press, Nai Pao Sriyanond, Deputy Minister of Interior and Director-General of Police, who directly presided over the arrests, said in the National Assembly: "The details of the conspiracy were decided at the recent meeting in Beijing."
    Obviously, the Plaek Phibunsongkhram government's shameless methods can only further expose its adherence to the U.S. imperialist war policy and its hostile attitude towards peace.

    美国反动统治集团
    迫害美国出席和平会议代表
    泰政府污蔑和平会议并逮捕爱国者
    据新华社讯：美国统治集团采用法西斯手段迫害出席亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的美国代表。据美国国际新闻社消息，美国政府已于十六日发出一项所谓“适用于全世界范围”的通缉令，要逮捕和审讯出席和平会议的全部美国代表。美国国务院已通知所有美国入境口岸，同时还命令美国驻各地使馆，要它们把返回美国或正在返国途中的美国和平代表，逮捕起来并吊销他们的护照。这件事情表明：亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的巨大成就，已使美国好战的统治者大为惊惶。美国“纽约时报”十月七日发表的社论就曾说：“如果认为这次会议毫不重要，那就将是一个错误。”这家报纸在十月十三日又喊叫这次会议是对美国的“挑战”，要求美国以“全部力量来应付它”。但是，美国统治集团在会前阻挠美国代表到北京参加会议的阴谋已经失败了，现在企图用恐怖手段来压制和平运动也必然要失败。
    泰国銮披汶反动政府正在发动一个大规模镇压国内和平力量的运动。泰国警察当局于九日晚起连日大举捕人。据美联社曼谷十二日电说，泰国警察已逮捕了泰国和平委员会主席乃乍仑·速盛等二百多人。另有消息说，泰国警察当局共要逮捕五百多人。銮披汶控制的国民议会并且在十三日通过一项法西斯法律，以进一步迫害要求和平的人民。按照这项法律，反动统治当局就可以对要求和平的人民随意加上所谓进行“共产主义活动”的“罪名”，并判处五年徒刑至无期徒刑。
    为了掩饰这些暴行，銮披汶政府竟制造了一个荒唐透顶的藉口说：采取这些措施是因为发现了所谓
    “企图推翻泰国现政府的阴谋”。据合众社报道，直接主持这次逮捕的内政部副部长兼警察总监乃炮·是耶暖并且在国民议会中说：“阴谋的详细内容是在最近北平召开的会议上决定的。”
    很明显的，銮披汶政府这种无耻手段只能更加暴露出它依从美帝国主义战争政策、敌视和平的面目。
