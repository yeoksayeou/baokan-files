The Experience of the Soviet Army Red Flag Song and Dance Ensemble
--Report at the Conference of Literary and Art Workers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army in Beijing on November 10, 1952
Bao·Ya·Aleksandrov, Head of the Soviet Army Red Flag Song and Dance Ensemble

Dear comrades and friends,

Please allow me to briefly introduce the general situation and creative activities of the song and dance ensemble I lead.

The Soviet Aleksandrov Red Flag Song and Dance Ensemble is one of the largest and most popular musical performance groups in the Soviet Union. Our song and dance ensemble consists of three parts: a male choir, an orchestra, and a dance troupe. The choir has a total of one hundred and thirty people, including tenors, baritones, altos, and basses.

The best singers in the choir are the soloists of the song and dance ensemble. The dance troupe has a total of fifty actors, including eleven actresses.

The orchestra includes a string orchestra composed of Russian folk instruments such as balalaikas and accordions, and a wind band composed of instruments such as flutes, pipes, and trumpets. The entire orchestra has sixty musicians.

This song and dance ensemble was founded in Moscow in 1928 at the initiative of the Soviet government and the Communist Party. Initially, the entire song and dance ensemble had only twelve people, but now it has 250 people, including musicians, singers, and dancers.

The task of this song and dance ensemble is to widely disseminate modern songs, folk songs, and classical songs by Soviet-era composers. The task of the dance troupe is to create and perform large-scale dances that reflect the current life of the Soviet army, mainly based on Russian folk dances.

In addition to myself, the leaders of this song and dance ensemble also include the following assistants: Honored Artist and Stalin Prize winner Lieutenant Colonel Vinogradov, who is the captain of the choir; Honored Artist and Stalin Prize winner Lieutenant Colonel Virsky, who is the leader of the dance troupe; and Honored Actor of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic Major Fu·Ya·Aleksandrov, who is the music conductor of the ensemble.

This song and dance ensemble conveys its art to the broadest masses of the people, performing in Soviet army units, as well as in clubs, theaters, concert halls, and open-air squares for the broad working people of our country. For twenty-four years, we have performed all over the Soviet Union, even in the most remote and out-of-the-way places.

During the war, we went to the front to perform, using our art to encourage the Soviet army soldiers to establish meritorious service for the honor and independence of the motherland. In 1929 and 1938, when the Japanese imperialists attempted to invade the Soviet border, our song and dance ensemble performed on the Far Eastern front.

From the beginning of the Great Patriotic War, our song and dance ensemble worked in the war zone. The songs and dances of our song and dance ensemble encouraged the Red Army commanders and fighters to fight the German fascist invaders fearlessly. During the four years of the war, this song and dance ensemble went to various battlefields. In our art, we always express a vigorous feeling, strength, and confidence in victory. Some actors were wounded on the front lines. The Soviet government praised them with military medals for their participation in the Great Patriotic War. When we performed on the front lines, we personally saw the Russian cities and villages destroyed by the fascists, and we personally saw the German fascist air force strafing the women and children gathered at the train stations. The fascist atrocities aroused great indignation among the Soviet people, and they were determined to help their beloved motherland with all their strength to crush the brutal enemy. The most important weapon of our song and dance ensemble is its art.

With combat songs, humorous talks, and passionate dances, our song and dance ensemble awakens the audience's belief in their own strength, their belief in achieving final victory, and their determination to establish meritorious service.

This song and dance ensemble not only performs in units waiting to depart for combat, but also performs in units undergoing rest and replenishment, as well as in military hospitals, on airfields, and in artillery positions. At that time, we had to work non-stop, with no opportunity to rest. We often encountered days like this: we had just finished performing in one place, and immediately took a car to rush to another place to perform, and as soon as we finished performing, we went to the next place.

Our song and dance ensemble was not used to performing during marches, but no difficulties or inconveniences could reduce the tension in our performances. The excitement generated by the audience's infection with the art of the ensemble, their happy faces, their laughter, and their warm applause, was the best reward for us.

At the beginning of the Great Patriotic War, Aleksandr Aleksandrov and the poet Lebedev-Kumach jointly created a song called "The Sacred War." This is one of the most outstanding songs created by Aleksandr Aleksandrov. This song is ordinary, serious, and majestic. Every note expresses the Soviet people's hatred for the enemy, reflects the powerful strength of our people, and demonstrates our people's confidence in victory.

"The Sacred War" was first performed not in a concert hall, not in a club, but on the platform of the Moscow train station, where many military vehicles were heading to the front. This song left a very deep impression on people. The Soviet people quickly fell in love with this song and learned to sing it. "The Sacred War" is a fighting and victorious banner of our people and our army in the Great Patriotic War.

At that time, there was also a song in the program of the song and dance ensemble, composed by the composer Novikov based on the words of the poet Alimov, "Water Pot - Matchlock Gun." The song humorously compares the actions of the Soviet Guards' mortars, which the people call "Katyusha," with the Russian water pots. This song was extremely popular among soldiers on the front lines. The artillerymen, in order to thank the song and dance ensemble for their performance, always happily showed us their combat skills.

Once on a certain battle line, the song and dance ensemble performed a song called "Water Pot - Matchlock Gun." After our performance, the unit commander made a few brief remarks to the song and dance ensemble on behalf of the audience:

"Dear comrades! You just gave us a wonderful performance. In return, in a few minutes, our 'actors' will also perform. They will show you the actions of the 'Water Pot - Matchlock Gun'."

When the hands of the clock reached the scheduled time, a command was given:

"In order to express our respect to the Red Flag Song and Dance Ensemble, fire at the enemy!"

In this way, the enemy was splashed with deadly "boiling water." This was not a rare occurrence.

During the Great Patriotic War, the Red Flag Song and Dance Ensemble played many songs praising the heroic behavior of the Soviet people in defending their motherland. These songs were of various kinds in nature. Among them were hymns, marches, lyrical songs, and humorous songs. The most famous were: Aleksandr Aleksandrov's songs "The Sacred Banner of Lenin," "Poem of Ukraine," "Song of the Soviet Army"; Solovyov-Sedoi's songs "Night at the Mooring," "Why on the Other Side of the Kama River," "Nightingale"; Blanter's songs "In the Forest Near the Front Line," "Goodbye, Cities and Houses"; Vladkin's song "Dnieper River," and many other songs.

Sometimes, in order to commemorate the combat merits of a certain unit, I had to stay on the front line to compose songs. I still remember such a thing. I wrote a song to commemorate the merits of the Stalingrad Guards Brigade. The song and dance ensemble quickly learned it and performed it at a front-line concert. The Guards soldiers liked the song very much, and they also learned it, and regarded learning this song as their combat mission. I soon received a letter from the Guards soldiers, in which they wrote:

"In order to carry out the orders of the motherland, our unit, together with the entire Soviet army, is participating in offensive battles to liberate our sacred land from the hands of the fascist demons.

"We still remember the performance of the Red Flag Song and Dance Ensemble in our place. The combat songs of the song and dance ensemble are a call for new victories, a call for a thorough reckoning with the bloody fascist executioners. These songs, like the song commemorating our brigade, are songs that everyone will sing. The soldiers sing these songs and bravely move forward and resolutely join the battle.

"We hope that your song and dance ensemble will continue to inspire the Soviet soldiers with your brave songs to achieve new victories. We assure you that we must fight like the Stalingrad Guards soldiers. We must work together to achieve the moment of the victory of the war that we hope for. At that time, the songs of the song and dance ensemble will also call on us to carry out constructive labor, just as they call on us today to go to the battlefield to defeat the enemy."

I received this touching letter in 1943, when the Great Patriotic War was at its hottest period.

The war is over. The long-awaited victory day finally arrived. As soon as the peaceful period began, the great constructive labor of the Soviet people to restore and develop our national economy immediately began in accordance with the call of the Communist Party.

The Soviet army turned to peacetime, and our brave soldiers returned to their motherland from the foreign land liberated by the Soviet army. In addition to describing the theme of victory, the theme of soldiers returning home after heroically completing all war tasks, cherishing their families and hometowns, and cherishing peaceful labor has also become one of the main themes of the song and dance ensemble's creation in the post-war period. The song and dance ensemble's program included Aleksandr Aleksandrov's "Ode to Victory" and "Dear Hometown," my "Victory Song," Solovyov-Sedov's "Where are you now, dear companions?", Blanter's "Under the Balkan Stars," Novikov's "The Day is Not Far Away," and many other songs. The fact that a new batch of young soldiers who had not fought in the war came to the Soviet army after the demobilization of the combat troops was also reflected in the song and dance ensemble's program, with the emergence of peacetime soldier marches, songs commemorating individual heroes, songs commemorating the historically significant battles of the Soviet army, and songs about the combat and political study of young soldiers who are entrusted by the motherland to strictly protect the peaceful labor of the Soviet people who are building communism. The post-war life of our motherland is also reflected in the songs of the song and dance ensemble: such as Yakudenko's "Young Soldier Song," Blanter's "Sunset" and "Harvest Song," Duriakov's "We Defend Peace," Belyi's "Defend Peace" and "Ode to Matrosov," Mokrousov's "Spring Garden Flowers are Good," Nosov's "Distant Places," Dunaevsky's "I Come From Berlin," and Novikov's "March of the World Democratic Youth."

During this period, I wrote two songs dedicated to Comrade Stalin, one of which was "Celebrating the October Revolution." To commemorate the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, which was held not long ago, I wrote a song "Ode to the Communist Party."

The Red Flag Song and Dance Ensemble, which has always served the interests of the people of the motherland, is constantly thinking of using its songs and dances to reflect the major events of the motherland and the thoughts and feelings of the people. Therefore, it is completely reasonable that the program of the song and dance ensemble includes songs praising the peaceful labor of the working people in urban and rural areas, songs praising the Soviet people's struggle for world peace, and songs praising the great Stalin communist construction projects. In addition, the recent program of the song and dance ensemble has added national songs of friends in the new democratic countries. The Red Flag Song and Dance Ensemble has been performing Chinese people's songs very effectively in our country for two years, such as "March of the Chinese People's Liberation Army" and "For the Liberation of the Motherland." As for the composer Morateli's "Moscow-Beijing," which is a song that hundreds of millions of Soviet people can sing, there is no need for me to introduce it.

In order to most effectively solve the creative tasks facing our song and dance ensemble, we are vigorously conducting professional and political studies among our staff. Under the guidance of experienced teachers, our singers, musicians, and dancers are improving their professional skills and studying the works of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin to broaden their political and ideological horizons. This study helps us to cultivate each actor into a Soviet artist who has both ability and integrity.

The performing art of songs and dances is deeply popular. It is simple, clear, powerful, and full of the realistic spirit characteristic of popular creation.

The Soviet state cares about the development and cultivation of people's talents, and attaches great importance to and supports the continuous emergence of young buds in the field of art, because these young buds can make art more developed and richer. The Soviet Army Red Flag Song and Dance Ensemble was originally this kind of newborn bud, and it created new forms for Soviet performing arts.

The song and dance ensemble was born in the Soviet army and developed with the Soviet army. The birth of the song and dance ensemble is organically linked to the upsurge of labor and culture that appeared when the Soviet people were implementing the first five-year plan (1928-1933), and it is a direct result of the cultural improvement of the Soviet army.

The Soviet army is a new type of army. It has been educated by the ideas of Lenin and Stalin, and has been tempered by fighting against the enemies of the motherland, and has become the most powerful army in the world. It is already a great school for cultivating courage and communist morality, and it is also a promoter of advanced Soviet culture.

The Soviet Army Song and Dance Ensemble, which is closely related to the Soviet army, draws inspiration from the lives of Soviet soldiers, and cultivates in its creations an infinite loyalty to the motherland and the Communist Party, courage, and optimism, which are the characteristics of the Soviet army.

The Soviet army is the family of the Soviet people, and therefore, songs depicting the images of Soviet soldiers have become extremely popular songs. From the very beginning of its establishment, the song and dance ensemble has embraced the inspiring and lofty goal of determining its own creative path, that is, to use the songs popular in the Soviet army to praise the heroic achievements of the Soviet army, to make these songs the enjoyment of the people, and to help the Soviet army composers and poets to create new songs that can reflect the life of the Soviet army under the new conditions.

The origin of the Far Eastern Guerrilla Song "Along the Mountains, Along the Plains" and its subsequent spread are very interesting. The composer of this song has not been found. The people created this song. In 1929, when the song and dance ensemble went to perform in the Soviet army units, Professor Aleksandr Aleksandrov heard a company of soldiers singing this song to participate in our performance. After he got acquainted with the company commander, he wrote a new song based on the tune compiled by the company commander, and after his musical processing, this Far Eastern Guerrilla Song greatly enhanced the performance program of the song and dance ensemble at that time. This song quickly spread from the song and dance ensemble to the mouths of all Soviet people, "old and young." Soviet people are singing it everywhere, and it is loved by foreign people, and foreign people are also singing it.

The song and dance ensemble often works hard on Soviet soldier songs, helping to create many new and excellent songs, which are not only loved by the various ethnic groups of the Soviet Union, but also loved by hundreds of millions of people abroad, including the people of the People's Republic of China.

Some of the excellent songs created by our song and dance ensemble have become models for the creation of Soviet composers, poets, and singers.

People call the Red Flag Song and Dance Ensemble a "laboratory of Soviet songs." The reason why it is called a "laboratory" is because our song and dance ensemble not only performs the best songs of poets and composers, but also studies with the authors and tries its best to help them find a reliable path for creating new and beautiful songs.

For this purpose, we often hold creative seminars to discuss and analyze in all aspects all the new songs that the song and dance ensemble is preparing to perform. Representatives from the Soviet Composers Association, the Soviet Writers Association, and the General Political Department of the Soviet Army participate in such seminars.

The specific opinions on music and new songs raised by the participants can enable us to objectively and accurately evaluate a certain song, and help the authors to understand the shortcomings of the song, so as to more accurately and perfectly solve the tasks of ideological and artistic nature.

From the song and dance program performed by the song and dance ensemble, one can see the spiritual realm of the Soviet people. The diverse program of the song and dance ensemble includes both Soviet-era songs and dances, as well as folk music and classical music. These programs are all strictly selected. It must be familiar and understood by the broad masses of the people in terms of ideological content, artistry, and clarity and simplicity of form. All the creative activities of the song and dance ensemble are closely linked to the lives of the Soviet people and their powerful army. The song and dance ensemble is built on the excellent traditions of Russian folk art and classical art.

Each military region of the Soviet army has its own song and dance ensemble. Although the number of actors is smaller than that of the Red Flag Song and Dance Ensemble, they are all established according to the model of the Red Flag Song and Dance Ensemble. The leaders of the song and dance ensembles of the military regions meet regularly in Moscow to exchange creative experiences.

The Red Flag Song and Dance Ensemble often helps its younger brothers and sisters, the song and dance ensembles of the military regions of the Soviet army, in terms of creative experience and organizational experience.

The Soviet Air Force Song and Dance Ensemble and the Navy Song and Dance Ensemble are also established according to the model of our song and dance ensemble.

All the song and dance ensembles in the Soviet Union constantly help the soldiers to carry out amateur art activities: teaching the leading singers of the company to sing new songs, or performing new dances, leading the orchestras of folk instruments, and preparing local amateur art performances for the recreational inspections and recreational meetings of the military region.

Excellent singers, dancers, and musicians become actors in the song and dance ensemble. In our Red Flag Song and Dance Ensemble, there are many people who are very talented amateur art activists. For example, our soloists Savchuk and Puchkov are such people. The experience of our soloist Kuznechov is very interesting. Before entering the army, he was a rural shepherd. When he served in the army, the leaders of the song and dance ensemble discovered that he had a beautiful and loud throat. Kuznechov began to practice his voice and improve his musical cultivation, and then joined our song and dance ensemble. In the song and dance ensemble, due to his achievements in work, he was awarded the title of Honored Actor of the Republic.

The first leader of our song and dance ensemble was Aleksandr Aleksandrov, a famous composer of the older generation in the Soviet Union, whose famous works are "Ode to Stalin" and "Soviet National Anthem."

Aleksandr Aleksandrov was born in 1883 in a poor peasant family in the Kazan province. From childhood, he grew up among some ordinary but musically talented people, from whom he laid the foundation of folk musical ideas. When Aleksandrov was still young, his loud voice, clear tone, and accurate and rapid musical memory were loved by the villagers. A lucky opportunity allowed the young Aleksandr Aleksandrov to receive musical education. After graduating from the composition class and solo class of the Moscow Conservatory, he soon became a teacher at the Conservatory, and from 1922, he became a professor at the Conservatory. At the same time, he led the most outstanding choir in Moscow.

In 1928, Aleksandr Aleksandrov came to lead the newly established Soviet Army Red Flag Song and Dance Ensemble. He led this song and dance ensemble for a total of eighteen years, until his death in 1946. During this period, Aleksandr Aleksandrov created many beautiful songs that were popular among the people and the army of the Soviet Union. In addition to the "Ode to Stalin" and "Soviet National Anthem" that I have already mentioned, there are also "Song of Stalin," "Life Has Become Better," "Volga Boatman's Song," "March of the Motherland," "Sacred War," "Song of the Soviet Army," "Poem of Ukraine," and "Dear Hometown." Under the leadership of Aleksandr Aleksandrov, the Red Flag Song and Dance Ensemble became a group with artistic value and one of the advanced troops of Soviet art. According to the decision of the Soviet government, the Red Flag Song and Dance Ensemble was given the title of Aleksandr Aleksandrov.

The creative activities of the song and dance ensemble have been awarded by the Soviet government three times. All our staff have been awarded the Honorary Revolutionary Red Banner Award, and some have been awarded the Red Star Medal and the Combat Red Banner Medal. Five people in the song and dance ensemble have won the first prize of the Stalin Prize, two have won the title of Honored Artist, sixteen singers and dancers have won the title of Honored Actor of the Russian Republic, and twenty actors are winners of the Budapest World Democratic Youth and Students Festival. A large number of people have won Soviet medals and awards.

Our song and dance ensemble has successfully performed Soviet art in many countries, such as Czechoslovakia, Poland, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, the Mongolian People's Republic, France, Finland, and the German Democratic Republic. At the Paris International Technical Exhibition, this song and dance ensemble won a large trophy cup.

Our song and dance ensemble came to our friendly country - the People's Republic of China with the most pleasant mood. The song and dance ensemble performs the best programs to show the vast masses of the Chinese people. We hope to further understand the high culture of the great Chinese people and enrich our programs with the beautiful songs and dances of the Chinese people.

If the performance of our song and dance ensemble in China can promote the further consolidation of the permanent and unbreakable friendship between the two great peoples of China and the Soviet Union, then we will feel infinitely honored. (Xinhua News Agency)

    苏军红旗歌舞团的经历
    ——一九五二年十一月十日在北京中国人民解放军部队文艺工作者大会上的报告
    苏军红旗歌舞团团长  鲍·亚·亚历山大罗夫亲爱的同志们，朋友们：
    请允许我把我领导的歌舞团，把它的一般情况和创作活动简单地介绍一下。
    苏联亚历山大罗夫红旗歌舞团是苏联最大的最受群众欢迎的音乐演奏团之一。我们这个歌舞团是由男子合唱队，乐队，舞蹈组三个部分组成的。合唱队总共一百三十人。其中包括男高音，次高音，中音和低音。
    合唱队中最好的歌手就是歌舞团的独唱者。舞蹈小组一共五十位演员，其中有十一位女演员。
    乐队包括有由俄罗斯民间乐器如弦琴、手风琴等组成的弦乐队以及由笛、管、喇叭等乐器组成的管乐队。整个乐队有六十位音乐家。
    本歌舞团由苏联政府与共产党发起，于一九二八年在莫斯科创立的。起初全歌舞团只有十二人，现在已经有二百五十人，其中包括音乐家、歌唱家和舞蹈家。
    本歌舞团的任务是广泛地传播苏维埃时代作曲家的近代歌曲、民间歌曲以及古典歌曲。舞蹈组的任务是创造和演出，主要是以俄国民间舞为基础的，反映目前苏军生活的大型舞蹈。
    本歌舞团领导人除我以外，还有以下几位助理：功勋艺术家、斯大林奖金获得者维诺格拉陀夫中校任本团合唱队长，功勋艺术家、斯大林奖金获得者维尔斯基中校任舞蹈组长，俄罗斯苏维埃联邦社会主义共和国功勋演员符·亚·亚历山大罗夫少校任本团音乐指挥。
    本歌舞团把自己的艺术传达到最广大的人民群众中去，在苏军部队中表演，也在俱乐部、戏院、音乐厅、露天广场向我国广大劳动者表演。我们二十四年来，演遍了苏联各地，直到最辽远最偏僻的地方。
    在战争的时候，我们就到前方去表演，用自己的艺术来鼓舞苏军军人为祖国的荣誉和独立而建立战功。一九二九年，一九三八年，当日本帝国主义者企图侵犯苏联国境的时候，我们的歌舞团就在远东前线表演过。
    从伟大卫国战争开始时起，我们歌舞团就在战区工作。我们歌舞团的歌唱和舞蹈，鼓舞着红军指战员奋不顾身地去和德国法西斯侵略者作斗争，四年战争期间，本歌舞团到过各个战场。在我们的艺术中，总是表现出生气勃勃的感觉、力量和必胜的信心，有些演员在前线负了伤，苏联政府因为他们参加伟大卫国战争用军功勋章表扬了他们。我们在前方表演时，亲眼看到被法西斯所毁坏了的俄罗斯城市和乡村，亲眼看到了德国法西斯的空军扫射那些聚集在火车站上的妇女和儿童。法西斯的兽行激起了苏联人民的巨大愤慨，他们决意要以全力帮助亲爱的祖国来粉碎残暴的敌人。我们歌舞团最主要的武器就是它的艺术。
    我们歌舞团以战斗的歌曲、板话和激情的舞蹈，唤起观众相信自己的力量，相信获得最后的胜利，并决心去建立功勋。
    本歌舞团不仅在待命出发作战的部队中表演，在休整和补充的部队中表演，也在军医院中，在飞机场上，在炮兵阵地上表演。当时我们只得不停地工作，没有休息的机会。常常碰到这样的日子：我们刚刚在一处演完，马上就坐汽车飞驰到另一个地方去表演，刚一演完，又马上到下一个地方去。
    我们歌舞团本来不习惯在行军时表演，但是任何的困难和不方便的地方，都不能降低我们表演中的紧张情绪，观众由于受本团艺术感染而产生的兴奋情绪。快乐面孔，他们的欢笑声和热烈的掌声，对我们来说，乃是最好的奖励。
    在伟大卫国战争初期，亚历山大·亚历山大罗夫与诗人列别节夫、库马奇共同创造了一首名叫“神圣战争”的歌曲。这是亚历山大·亚历山大罗夫所创作的最优秀的歌曲之一。这首歌平常、严肃而又雄伟，它的每一个音调都表达了苏联人民对敌人的仇恨，反映了我国人民的强大力量，表明了我国人民获得胜利的信心。
    “神圣战争”最初不是在音乐厅，不是在俱乐部，而是在莫斯科车站月台上演出的，在这个车站上有许多军车开往前线。这歌曲给人们留下一个很深刻的印象。苏联人民很快地就爱上了这首歌，并且都学会唱它。“神圣战争”是我们人民、我们军队在伟大卫国战争中一面战斗的、胜利的旗帜。
    当时在歌舞团节目中还有一首歌，是作曲家诺维科夫根据诗人阿里莫夫的词“水火壶——火绳枪”作成的。歌子滑稽地把人民称之为“卡秋莎”的苏联近卫军的迫击炮的动作与俄国的水火壶来作比较。这首歌子在前线军人中极为流行。炮兵为了感谢本歌舞团的表演，始终都是兴高彩烈地让我们看看他们的战斗技巧。
    有一次在某段战线上，我们歌舞团演出节目中有一首歌子“水火壶——火绳枪”，在我们演出之后，部队指挥官代表观众向歌舞团全体演员扼要地讲了几句话：
    “亲爱的同志们！你们刚才给我们开了一个精彩的表演会。为了报答你们，稍过几分钟，我们的‘演员’也要出演了，他们要给你们看看‘水火壶——火绳枪’的动作”。
    当表针到了预定时间的时候，一声口令：
    “为了向红旗歌舞团表示敬意，向敌人开炮！”
    这样一来，敌人身上就泼上了致命的“滚开水”。这并不是稀罕的事情。
    在伟大卫国战争时期，红旗歌舞团演奏了很多歌颂苏联人民保卫祖国的英勇行为的歌子。这些歌子按其性质来说是各种各样的。其中有赞颂歌、行军曲、抒情歌、滑稽歌。最享盛名的有：亚历山大·亚历山大罗夫的歌子“神圣的列宁旗帜”、“乌克兰之诗”、“苏军歌”；索洛维约夫—谢道伊的歌子“停泊场之夜”、“为什么在卡玛河彼岸”、“夜莺”；布兰特尔的歌子“在前线附近的森林里”、
    “再见吧，城市和房屋”；弗拉得金的歌子“第聂伯河”，及其他很多的歌子。
    我有时为了纪念某一部队的战斗功勋，不得不留在前线来作歌子。我还记得有这样一件事情，我为了纪念斯大林格勒近卫旅的功勋曾写过一只歌子。歌舞团很快就学会了，就在前线音乐会上演出了。近卫军人很喜欢这首歌，也学会了这首歌，并且把学会这歌子当做是自己的战斗任务。我很快就从近卫军人那里收到一封信，他们写道：
    “为了执行祖国的命令，我们部队与全苏联军队一道参加进攻战斗，要把我们的神圣土地从法西斯恶魔手中解放出来。
    “我们还记得红旗歌舞团在我们那里表演的情形。歌舞团的战斗歌曲是争取新胜利的号召，是和血腥的法西斯刽子手们彻底清算的号召。这些歌子，和纪念我们旅的歌子一样，是每个人都会唱的歌子。战士们唱着这些歌子，勇敢地前进，果敢地加入战斗。
    “希望你们的歌舞团继续用你们勇敢的歌曲来鼓舞苏军战士获得新的胜利。我们向你们保证，我们一定要像斯大林格勒近卫军人那样地战斗着。我们要以共同努力来达到我们所希望的战争胜利的时刻。到那时候，歌舞团的歌子也像今天号召我们去战场上战胜敌人一样，来号召我们进行建设性的劳动”。
    这一封令人感动的信，我是在一九四三年当伟大卫国战争最炽热的时期收到的。
    战争结束了。渴望已久的胜利日终于来到了。和平时期一开始，根据共产党的号召，苏联人民恢复和发展我国国民经济的伟大建设性劳动也立即开始了。
    苏军转入和平时光，我们的勇敢军人从被苏军解放了的外国境土上回到祖国来。除了描写胜利的主题以外，英勇完成全部战争任务、怀念家庭故乡、怀念和平劳动的士兵归家这一主题，也成了本歌舞团在战后时期创作歌曲的主要主题之一。歌舞团节目中出现了亚历山大·亚历山大罗夫的“胜利颂”和“亲爱的故乡”，我所作的“胜利歌”，索洛维约夫—谢多夫的“你们现在在那里呢，亲爱的同伴们？”，布兰特尔的“在巴尔干的星光下”，诺维科夫的“为期不远”，以及其他许多歌子。在战斗部队复员之后，苏军里面又来了一批没有作战过的新的青年士兵，这种情形也反映在歌舞团节目中，出现了和平时期的士兵行军歌，怀念个别英雄的歌子，怀念苏军具有历史意义的战役的歌子，关于青年士兵进行战斗学习和政治学习的歌子，这些战士受了祖国的委托，来严密地保卫建设共产主义的苏维埃人民的和平劳动。我们祖国的战后生活也在歌舞团歌曲中得到反映：如亚库登科的“青年士兵歌”，布兰特尔的“太阳落山”和“收获歌”，杜里柯夫的“我们保卫和平”，别雷依的“保卫和平”和“马特洛索夫颂”，莫克洛乌索夫的“春天的花园花儿好”，诺索夫的“遥远的地方”，杜那耶夫斯基的“我来自柏林”，诺维科夫的“世界民主青年进行曲”。
    我在这一期间写了两首献给斯大林同志的歌子，有一首是“祝十月革命”。为了纪念不久以前召开的苏联共产党第十九次代表大会，我作了一只“歌颂共产党”的歌子。
    始终为祖国人民利益服务的红旗歌舞团，无时无刻不在想用自己的歌舞来反映祖国的大事和人民的思想和感情。因此在歌舞团节目中出现了歌颂城乡劳动人民的和平劳动的歌子，歌颂苏联人民争取全世界和平的歌子，歌颂伟大的斯大林共产主义建设工程的歌子，是完全合乎情理的。除此之外，歌舞团最近期间的节目又添增了新民主主义国家朋友们的民族歌曲。红旗歌舞团已经在两年来很有成效地在我们国内演奏了中国人民的歌曲，如“中国人民解放军进行曲”和“为了祖国的解放”。至于作曲家莫拉特里作的“莫斯科—北京”是我们亿万苏联人民都会唱的歌子，更用不着我来介绍了。
    为了最有成效地解决摆在我们歌舞团面前的创作任务，我们在我们工作人员当中大力进行业务学习和政治学习。在富有经验的教师们的指导下，我们的歌手、音乐家和舞蹈家都在提高自己的业务，并且学习马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的著作来扩大自己的政治思想的眼界。这种学习帮助我们把每个演员都培养成为德才兼备的苏联艺术工作者。
    歌舞的表演艺术是带有深刻的人民性的。它朴素、鲜明、有力、充满了人民创作所特有的现实精神。
    苏维埃国家关心人民天才的发挥和培养，极为重视并支持艺术方面不断涌现出的幼芽，因为这些幼芽能够使艺术更加发展和更加丰富起来。苏军红旗歌舞团原来就是这种新生的幼芽，它为苏联的表演艺术创作了新的形式。
    歌舞团产生在苏军中并和苏军一道发展起来。歌舞团的诞生是与苏联人民在实现第一个五年计划时（一九二八——一九三三）所出现的劳动和文化高潮有机地联系在一起的，它是苏军文化提高的直接结果。
    苏军是一支新型的军队。它受过列宁、斯大林的思想教育，并经历过与祖国的敌人作战的锻炼，而已经成为世界上最强大的军队。它已经是培养勇敢精神与共产主义道德的伟大学校，同时也是先进的苏联文化的传播者。
    与苏军血肉相连的苏军歌舞团，从苏联军人们的生活中汲取灵感，在自己的创作中培养起对祖国及共产党的无限忠诚，勇敢精神及乐观主义，这些都是苏联军队的特色。
    苏军是苏联人民的亲人，因而描绘苏军军人形象的歌曲也就成为极受欢迎的歌曲。歌舞团从最初成立之日起就抱有确定自己的创作道路的那种令人鼓舞的崇高目的，那就是利用苏军中流行的歌曲来歌颂苏军的英雄功绩，使这些歌曲成为人民的享受物，帮助苏军作曲家及诗人去创造能反映新条件下苏军生活的新歌曲。
    远东游击队歌“沿着高山，沿着平原”产生的经过以及它后来流传的情形是非常有趣的。这支歌子的作曲者已经查不清了。人民创造了这只歌子。一九二九年歌舞团到苏军部队中去表演时，亚历山大·亚历山大罗夫教授听见有一连战士唱着这支歌子来参加我们的表演会。他同这个连的连长相识之后，便根据这个连长所编的调子写了一首新歌，又经过他在音乐上的加工，这首远东游击队歌使当时这歌舞团的表演节目大为增色。这歌子很快地便从歌舞团流传到全苏联人“老老少少”的嘴边了。苏联人到处都在唱，它受到了外国人民的喜爱，外国人民也在唱。
    歌舞团经常在苏联士兵歌子上大大地用工夫，帮助创作了许多新的优秀的歌子，这些歌子不但受到苏联各族人民的热爱，而且受到国外亿万人民的热爱，也包括中华人民共和国的人民在内。
    我们歌舞团创作的一些优秀歌曲已经成为苏联作曲家、诗人、歌唱家的创作的典范。
    人们把红旗歌舞团称做“苏联歌曲的实验室”。其所以叫做“实验室”，是因为我们的歌舞团不仅演出诗人和作曲家的最优秀的歌曲，而且它自己还同作者共同研究，极力协助他们找出一条创作新的优美歌曲的可靠的道路。
    为了这个目的，我们经常举办创作座谈会，讨论并从各方面分析歌舞团准备演出的一切新歌。在这样的座谈会上，苏联作曲家协会、苏联作家协会和苏军总政治部都派有代表参加。
    参加会议的人对音乐及新歌曲所提出的具体意见，可以使我们最客观地、精确地评价某一歌曲，并帮助作者明了歌曲的缺点，以便更准确和更完美地解决思想性和艺术性的任务。
    从歌舞团表演的歌舞节目中，可以看到苏联人民的精神领域。歌舞团的多种多样的节目内，既包括有苏维埃时代的歌曲和舞蹈，又包括有民间音乐及古典音乐，这些节目都是经过严格的选择的。它在思想内容方面，在艺术性方面，在形式的明朗性和朴素性方面，都必须是广大民众所熟悉所了解的。歌舞团的一切创造活动都和苏联人民及其强大军队的生活紧密联系着。歌舞团是建筑在俄罗斯的民间艺术和古典艺术的优秀传统上的。
    苏军的每一个军区都有自己的歌舞团，其演员数量虽比红旗歌舞团少，但都是依照红旗歌舞团的样式建立起来的。各军区歌舞团的领导人定期在莫斯科聚会，以便交流创作经验。
    红旗歌舞团经常在创作经验和组织经验方面，帮助自己的弟弟——苏军各军区的歌舞团。
    苏联的空军歌舞团和海军歌舞团，也是按照我们歌舞团的样式建立起来的。
    苏联现有的一切歌舞团都经常地帮助战士开展业余艺术活动：教连队的领唱学唱新歌曲，或表演新的舞蹈，领导民间乐器的乐队，为军区的游艺检阅和游艺大会准备当地的业余艺术表演。
    优秀的歌唱家、舞蹈家及音乐家就成为歌舞团的演员。我们红旗歌舞团在内，也有不少的人是很有才干的业余艺术活动者。例如我们的独唱家萨夫楚克和普奇柯夫就是这样的人。我们的独唱家库兹聂卓夫的经历是很有趣的，他在进军队之前是一个农村的牧人，他在军队里服务时，歌舞团的领导人发现了他有美妙的、响亮的喉音，库兹聂卓夫就开始练习嗓子，提高自己的音乐修养，后来就加入了我们的歌舞团。他在歌舞团内，由于工作上的成就，获得了共和国功勋演员的称号。
    我们歌舞团的第一个领导人是苏联老一代的有名的作曲家亚历山大·亚历山大罗夫，他有名的作品是“斯大林颂”及“苏联国歌”。
    亚历山大·亚历山大罗夫在一八八三年生于加桑省一个不富的农民家庭中。从童年时代起，他就在一些平凡的、但富有音乐天才的人们中生长起来，他从这些人那里打下了民间音乐思想的基础。当亚历山大罗夫还小的时候，他那响亮的嗓子，清晰的音调，准确而迅速的音乐记忆力，就为同村人所喜爱。幸运的机会使这位年青的亚历山大罗夫能受到音乐教育。他在莫斯科音乐大学作曲班及独唱班毕业后，不久就成了音乐大学的教师，一九二二年起，成了音乐大学的教授。同时他领导了莫斯科最优秀的合唱团。
    在一九二八年，亚历山大·亚历山大罗夫就来领导初成立起来的苏军红旗歌舞团。他领导这个歌舞团共十八年，直到一九四六年他去世的时候止。在这个时期，亚历山大·亚历山大罗夫创作了许多美妙的歌曲，流行在苏联的人民和军队中。这些歌曲里除了我已提及的“斯大林颂”及“苏联国歌”外，还有“斯大林之歌”、“生活变好了”、“伏尔加船夫曲”、“祖国进行曲”、“神圣战争”、
    “苏军歌”、“乌克兰之诗”、“亲爱的故乡”。在亚历山大·亚历山大罗夫领导下，红旗歌舞团成了富有艺术价值的团体，是苏联艺术的先进部队之一。依照苏联政府的决定，赋予了红旗歌舞团以亚历山大·亚历山大罗夫的称号。
    歌舞团的创作活动曾三次获得苏联政府的奖赏。我们全体人员获得了荣誉革命红旗奖，有些人得了红星勋章及战斗红旗勋章。歌舞团内有五位获得了斯大林奖金一等奖，两位获得了功勋章艺术家的称号，十六位歌唱家及舞蹈家获得了俄罗斯共和国功勋演员的称号，二十位演员是布达佩斯世界民主青年与学生联欢大会得奖者。很大一部分人获得了苏联勋章和奖章。
    我们歌舞团在许多国家，如捷克斯洛伐克、波兰、罗马尼亚、保加利亚、匈牙利、蒙古人民共和国、法国、芬兰及德意志民主共和国，成功地表演了苏联的艺术。在巴黎国际技术展览会上，本歌舞团获得了一只大锦标杯。
    我们歌舞团怀着最愉快的心情来到了我们友好的国家——中华人民共和国。歌舞团演出最好的节目介绍给中国的广大人民群众看。我们希望进一步了解伟大中国人民的高度的文化，并用中国人民优美的歌舞来丰富我们的节目。
    如果我们歌舞团在中国的表演能促进中苏两大人民间永久的、牢不可破的友谊的进一步巩固，那么我们将感到无限的荣幸。（新华社）（附图片）
