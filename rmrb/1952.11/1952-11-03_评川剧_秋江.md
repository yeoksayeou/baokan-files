Editor's Note: Since the opening of the First National Opera Observation and Performance Conference in Beijing on October 6th, more than 80 programs of various sizes have been performed successively, including more than 20 types of opera. More than 1,600 people from local and Beijing delegations and observation groups participated in the conference. Starting today, this newspaper will publish some theater reviews and other articles related to this performance one after another. A comprehensive evaluation of the scripts and performances will be announced by the conference's award committee. The order of the theater reviews published here is only based on the order in which the manuscripts are received.

Sichuan Opera "Autumn River" is independently developed from the "Pursuit and Farewell" scene in Kunqu Opera "Jade Hairpin." "Jade Hairpin" tells the love story of scholar Pan Bizheng and female nun Chen Miaochang during the Southern Song Dynasty. The play was written by Gao Lian during the Wanli period of the Ming Dynasty, and was later adapted into various local operas. Not only was the dialogue enriched, but the lyrics also underwent great changes, adding more brilliance of folk art than the Kunqu version. For example, Sichuan Opera "Chen Gu Chasing Pan" has developed into an independent form of opera, which is the best proof of this development.

The Sichuan Opera "Autumn River," performed by the Southwest Delegation at the National Opera Observation and Performance Conference, is a scene from "Chen Gu Chasing Pan." The story outline is as follows: The old nun of "Nvzheng Temple" (sometimes called "Baiyun Nunnery") is Pan Bizheng's aunt. Pan studied in the temple and fell in love with the nun Miaochang. His aunt discovered their relationship and forced Pan to take the imperial examination. Pan was forced to go to Lin'an without even saying goodbye to Miaochang. After Miaochang found out, she rushed to the riverside to chase after him by boat. "Autumn River" specifically describes the scene of Miaochang driving a boat to catch up with Pan. Only Miaochang and a boatman appear in this scene. The boatman is a humorous and amiable old man who, seeing Miaochang's eagerness to chase Pan, deliberately created some obstacles and made some jokes. But fortunately, his boat is fast and he is confident of catching up. Gao Lian's "Jade Hairpin" has a very simple description of this section, with only about a hundred words of dialogue:

… (Little Net appears) Hearing someone calling, I came to steer the water, where are you going? (Dan) I want to buy a small boat from you to catch up with the scholar who is going to take the examination ahead, and send a family letter to Lin'an. I will reward you handsomely for the boat fare. (Little Net) The wind is too strong, you can't go. (Dan) Don't refuse, set sail early and catch up. I would rather give you more money. (Little Net) Get on the boat, get on the boat…

Although the Qianlong version of "Jade Hairpin" adds a little more, it is still less than two hundred words. Other local operas have fully developed and greatly revised this section, making it a very good independent play. Sichuan Opera "Autumn River" is one of them.

The revision of the script of Sichuan Opera "Autumn River" is a relatively good one for revising old scripts. The old version of "Autumn River" was basically good, but it also contained some vulgar elements. For example, the old version distorted the character of the boatman in terms of personality expression: the boatman took the opportunity to extort money and ridiculed Miaochang in every possible way, simply portraying him as a rogue. Undoubtedly, this is the dross in the national artistic heritage that should be eliminated. The Sichuan Opera reformers' work of eliminating this kind of dross is a scientific attitude of boldly discarding after specific analysis, not simply chopping and hacking indiscriminately. Moreover, after discarding, they have gone through a series of reasonable and meticulous supplementary efforts, without revealing flaws or scars, so it is more brilliant than the old version. This kind of revision work is in line with the principle of "eliminating dross, absorbing essence, and carrying forward the essence."

The section where the boatman extorts money in the old version of Sichuan Opera is largely retained in the revised version, but later the extra money is returned to Miaochang.

	Boatman: ... Auntie, these silvers have been riddled with wormholes.
	Chen: Pure silver has a honeycomb bottom.
	Boatman: I'll give you back six qian.
	Chen: Good silver, why don't you want it?
	Boatman: I'll only take three qian from you.
	Chen: Why did you want nine qian just now?
	Boatman: Hey, didn't you say you had money just now?
	Chen: Oh dear, grandpa, you see how long you've been delaying me!
	Boatman: It's okay, you can catch up! ...

This is not extortion, but joking, which is the lightness and twists and turns needed by the plot. For example, the revised version also made appropriate modifications to the section where the boatman teases Miaochang about paying for meals:

	Chen: Grandpa, start the boat quickly!
	Boatman: Oh, oh, oh, (aside) she's so anxious, I still want to play with her. Auntie, are you thirsty? There's water in the earthen jar, this old man won't keep you company.
	Chen: Where are you going?
	Boatman: I'm going back to eat.
	Chen: Is it far?
	Boatman: Not far, you can hear thunder, only forty li away.
	Chen: No way, no way!
	Boatman: Do you expect me to push you while I'm hungry?
	Chen: How much do you want to eat?
	Boatman: Hey, I eat a lot in one meal.
	Chen: How much?
	Boatman: I want to eat five liang four qian three!
	Chen: You can't eat that much!
	Boatman: Don't be scared, I want to eat five liang of liquor, four qian of clear oil fried three qian of tofu.
	Chen: This little bit is on me.
	Boatman: Oh, you're so generous, I won't eat it even if it's on you. I'm just playing with you. I've already eaten. I'll take you to Lin'an and only charge three qian, I won't eat your wine and food. Let's start the boat, auntie, sit tight, let's start the boat! ...

This shows the face of the working people, and also quite cleverly preserves the plot necessary for the plot, making the plot complete and the art more refined. But here, I would also like to raise a point for everyone to discuss: that is, the boatman asked Miaochang: "Neither relatives nor friends, why are you chasing him?" Miaochang answered directly: "He is my friend…". Then she said: "He is my friend!" In terms of her identity, thinking, and the specific environment at the time, it is not very reasonable to say this directly. In Gao Lian's "Jade Hairpin" and the "Jade Hairpin" collected in "Zhui Bai Qiu", Miaochang answered this way: "I want to catch up with the boat of the scholar who is going to take the imperial examination ahead and send a family letter to Lin'an…" I think it would be more circuitous and natural if Miaochang answered this first, and then said "friend" in desperation (followed by the original text of the revised version). In the "Jade Hairpin" version of "Zhui Bai Qiu", the anxious mood of Miaochang urging the boat to start quickly after getting on the boat is very vivid. For example:

	"(Net) ... Don't talk, please get off the boat. (Sticker) Hurry up! (Net) This is just the bow of my boat, still on the shore. (Sticker) Hurry up! (Net) Yes, yes (Sticker) Hurry up! Just slow down! (Net) Ah, after shaking for half a day, the boat cable hasn't been untied yet, wait for me to untie the cable. (Sticker) Row up quickly! (Net) Little master, I see that your anger hasn't subsided, why did you become a monk? (Sticker) Don't talk nonsense! Row quickly! (Net) Little master, sit tight, wait for me to sing a folk song for you. (Sticker) Don't! (Net) Wait for me to sing. (Sticker) Don't sing! (Net) I insist on singing! (Sticker) You don't row, what folk song are you singing!"

Several "hurry" and several "don't", coupled with the boatman's "slow", vividly depict Miaochang's anxious mood of chasing Pan. The description in this section of the revised version is relatively rough. Furthermore, some vulgar words and sentences in the old version of Sichuan Opera have been revised and deleted in the revised version, and some have been revised very well, such as:

	Boatman: Auntie, you are really a good person, I want to flatter you a few words.
	Chen: What are you flattering me about?
	Boatman: Auntie, you are born a flower, you are more beautiful than Chang'e in the moon, when you meet the scholar, congratulations on giving birth to…
	Chen: Give birth to what?
	Boatman: Give birth to a fat baby.
	Chen: Hey, what are you talking about! ...

But some individual words and sentences are unnecessary. For example, the original obscene words such as "flower purse" have been slightly modified, but they are still somewhat frivolous. It is inappropriate to come from the mouth of an old boatman, and it slightly hurts the character of the character.

In general, the theme, structure, lyrics, and dialogue of Sichuan Opera "Autumn River" are all beautiful and full of wit. It writes from the side the sincerity of Chen Miaochang and Pan Bizheng's love. In Chen's pursuit of love, the lovely boatman appeared. With the loving heart of an old grandfather towards young children, he deliberately "played" with Miaochang. Resistance is false, and help is real. In the development of the plot, the outer shell of "resistance" is finally peeled off layer by layer, revealing the actual power of support, and fulfilling the wish of love. The twists and turns in the middle add some twists and turns, creating a relaxed and joyful atmosphere for the whole play. This development is a very good supplement and an excellent creation to the original work of "Jade Hairpin".

The creation of the dance movements in the play "Autumn River" makes the script achieve a vivid and lively expression. The dance movements of Sichuan Opera are outstanding, and the beauty and diversity of the boat movements in "Autumn River" are even more prominent; this is refined and processed by the working people according to the realistic creation method of real life, which deserves our attention. The boat movements in the play are completely simulated and refined according to the specific environment of the turbulent rivers in Sichuan, such as the boat moving by itself when the current is rapid; the boat shaking when encountering small reefs, etc. The performance is very delicate and lifelike, and has a strong local flavor. Zhou Qihe (playing the boatman) and Yang Youhe (playing Miaochang) have also achieved success in their performances. They correctly and vividly introduced a good script to the audience, allowing everyone to gain a lot of benefits from the observation.

Finally, I would like to make a suggestion for the performance:

Since "Autumn River" is a performance of the sincerity of love, when Chen Miaochang arrives at the riverside, blocked by the big river, the boatman is obstructive, and the lover has left and is difficult to catch up, what a feeling of loss, worry and anxiety should the characters in the play have at that time? The person playing Miaochang focuses on portraying this feeling. Therefore, although it is necessary to show Miaochang's fear of the boat's bumps, it is not the main aspect. The script also has some arrangements for urging the boat, and the actors also have some performances in this regard, but it still seems insufficient. I think the reason is that the actors' performances mostly stay in the specific entanglement between the characters Miaochang and the boatman on the issue of urging the boat. This specific entanglement is to express the theme and is completely necessary; but if we can grasp this specific entanglement and more fully broaden the scope of the performance, the role of expressing the theme will be more significant. Urging the boat and sailing the boat are to catch up with Pan Bizheng in front. This concept should not be diluted or interrupted in the actor's feelings. Although Pan does not appear and Pan's boat cannot be seen, he must be played in the play, because he is an important character in the plot development of this play. Therefore, Miaochang should think of Pan Bizheng in front at all times, and deepen and change the feelings of chasing the lover in the constant encounter with difficulties and overcoming difficulties; and the boatman also accompanies this feeling, more closely adding many conflicts and twists and turns, so that the theme will be more clearly expressed.

    评川剧“秋江”
    马少波
    编者按：第一届全国戏曲观摩演出大会自十月六日在北京开幕后，已相继演出了大小节目八十多个，包括二十多种剧种。参加大会的各地及北京的代表团、观摩团计一千六百余人。本报自今日起陆续发表一些剧评及其他有关此次演出的文章。对剧本和演出的全面的评价，有待于大会评奖委员会公布。我们这里所发表的剧评的次序只依稿件收到先后而定。
    川剧“秋江”是从昆曲“玉簪记”中“追别”一出独立发展而来的。“玉簪记”写的是南宋年间书生潘必正和女尼陈妙常的恋爱故事。该剧为明万历年间高濂所作，后来经改编为各种地方戏，不仅在说白方面，丰富了许多；在唱词方面，也有了很大的变化，比昆曲本更增添了民间艺术的光彩。例如川剧“陈姑赶潘”已经发展成为独出戏的形式，正是这种发展最好的证明。
    西南代表团在全国戏曲观摩演出大会演出的川剧“秋江”，是“陈姑赶潘”中的一场。故事梗概如下：“女贞观”（有的叫“白云庵”）老尼是潘必正的姑母。潘寄读观中，与尼姑妙常恋爱，被姑母发觉，便逼潘赴科。潘未及与妙常告别，便被逼着赴临安去了。妙常知道后急急赶到江边，驾船追送。“秋江”正是描写妙常驾船赶潘的一场，这场戏只有妙常和一个艄翁出场。艄翁是一个诙谐可喜的老人，见妙常追潘心急，故意给了一点阻碍，开了一点玩笑。但好在他的船快，是有把握追得上的。高濂的“玉簪记”关于这一段的描写非常简单，说白不过百字：
    ……（小净上）听得谁人叫，梢水就来到，到那里去的？（旦）我要买你一只小船，赶着前面会试的相公，寄封家书到临安去。船钱重谢。（小净）风大去不得。（旦）不要推辞，趁早开船赶上，宁可多送你些船钱。（小净）这等下船下船……
    乾隆本的“玉簪记”虽稍有增添，也不满二百字。其他地方戏根据这一关节，尽情发挥，大加修补，便成为一出很好的独出戏，川剧“秋江”就是其中之一。
    川剧“秋江”剧本的修改工作，是修改旧剧本较好的一个。“秋江”旧本基本上是好的，但也包含了若干庸俗成份，例如旧本对于艄翁这一人物，在性格表现上是歪曲的：艄翁乘机勒索，而且对妙常百般戏谑，简直写成了一个无赖恶徒。无疑的，这是民族艺术遗产中应该剔除的糟粕。川剧改革工作者进行这种剔除工作，是一种经过具体分析而大胆扬弃的科学态度，不是简单地乱削乱砍。而且扬弃之后，又经过一番入情合理、细针密线的补充的功夫，但不露破绽和伤痕，因此比旧本更加光彩了。这样的修改工作，是符合“剔除糟粕，吸收精华，并把精华部分发扬光大”的原则的。
    川剧旧本艄翁勒索一节，在改本中大体上仍加保留，但是后来却将多要的银子退还了妙常。
    艄：……姑姑，你这银子都给虫打了很多眼眼。
    陈：十足纹银是蜂窝底。
    艄：我退你六钱。
    陈：好银子啊，为?不要？
    艄：我只收你三钱。
    陈：刚才你为?要九钱？
    艄：噫，刚才你不是说你有钱吗？
    陈：哎呀，公公，你看耽搁我好久哦！
    艄：没来头，赶得上！……
    这就不是勒索，而是作耍，是剧情所需要的轻松和曲折。再如艄翁耍妙常包付饭钱一节，改本也作了适当的修改：
    陈：公公，快开船！
    艄：哦哦哦，（旁白）她好着急，我还要与她作
    作玩。姑姑，口渴吗？瓦罐里有水，老汉不陪你了。
    陈：你到那里去？
    艄：我回去吃饭。
    陈：有好远哦？
    艄：没得好远，打雷都听得到，只有四十里路。
    陈：要不得，要不得！
    艄：难道我饿着肚皮来推你？
    陈：你要吃多少？
    艄：嗨，我一顿就吃得多喃。
    陈：好多？
    艄：要吃五两四钱三！
    陈：那里吃得到这么多！
    艄：不要把你吓坏喽，我是要吃五两烧酒，四个
    钱的清油煎三个钱的豆腐。
    陈：这一点算我的。
    艄：哦，你好大方，算你的我也不吃。我给你作
    玩的，我吃过饭喽，我送你到临安，只收银
    三钱，不吃你的酒与饭，说到就开船，姑姑
    坐稳当，开船喽！……”
    这就表现了劳动人民的面貌，而又相当巧妙地保存了剧情必需的情节，使剧情完整无损，艺术上更加精练。但我在这里，还想提出一点意见，供大家商讨：即是艄翁问妙常：“非亲非故，你赶他则甚？”妙常直答：“我与他是朋……”。接着又说：“我与他是朋友啊！”以她的身份、思想和当时的具体环境说来，这样直说，是不甚合理的。明高濂的“玉簪记”和“缀白裘”所收的“玉簪记”中妙常是这样回答：“我要赶着前面会试相公的船，寄封家书到临安去……”我看如果妙常先答此话，在无可奈何之中再说出是“朋友”（下接改本原文）会更曲折、更自然些。在“缀白裘”中“玉簪记”本里，写妙常上船后催船快开的焦急之情是非常生动的。如：
    “（净）……弗要说哉，请下船来。（贴）快些！（净）这是我个只船头，还搁来里干岸浪来。（贴）快些！（净）是哉（贴）快些！只管慢腾腾！（净）阿呀摇子个半日，船缆不曾解来，等我去解了缆介。（贴）快些摇上去！（净）小师父，我看你火性不曾退来，出?家？（贴）不要胡说！快些摇！（净）小师父坐定了，待我唱只山歌你听听吓。（贴）不要！（净）待我唱。（贴）不要唱！（净）偏要唱！（贴）摇又不摇，唱什么山歌！”
    几个“快”字，几个“不要”，加以艄公“慢腾腾”的衬托，生动地描画出妙常追潘的焦急之情。改本在这一段的描写，是比较粗略的。再，川剧旧本中的一些庸俗词句，改本已经进行了修删，有的是改的很好的，如：
    艄：姑姑，你这人真好，我要奉承你几句。
    陈：你奉承我什么？
    艄：姑姑生来一枝花，月里嫦娥你比她，此去会
    着相公面，恭喜你明年要生……
    陈：生什么？
    艄：生个胖娃娃。
    陈：嗨，你说些?呀！……”
    但有的个别词句，是不必要的。如“花荷包”等几句原来含义猥亵的话，虽已略有修改，但仍嫌轻薄。出自老艄翁之口，是不合适的，对于剧中人的性格稍有伤害。
    总的说来，川剧“秋江”这一剧本的主题、结构、唱词、说白都是优美而饶有风趣的。它从侧面写了陈妙常和潘必正的爱的真挚。在陈的爱情的追求中，出现了可爱的艄翁，他以老祖父对小儿女的慈爱的心情，故意地和妙常“作作玩”。阻力是假的，助力是真的。在剧情发展中，终于层层地剥去了“阻力”的外壳，而显露出支助的实际力量，成全了爱的愿望。中间往返辗转，增加了若干曲折，构成了全剧轻松喜悦的气氛。这一发挥，对于“玉簪记”原作，真是很好的补充和卓越的创造。
    “秋江”一剧的舞蹈身段的创造，使剧本达到生动活泼的表现。川剧的舞蹈身段是出色的，而“秋江”中行船身段的优美多样，生动有致，更为突出；这是劳动人民根据现实生活用现实主义的创作方法提炼加工而成的，值得我们重视。剧中行船身段，完全是根据川中江流湍急的具体环境模拟提炼出来的，例如流急可以不划而船自行；过滩遇小礁则船身震荡等，演来非常细腻逼真，很具地方特色。周企何（饰艄翁）、杨友鹤（饰妙常）两演员在表演上也是有成绩的，他们正确而生动地把一个好剧本介绍给观众，使大家从观摩中获得不少益处。
    最后，对于表演，我提出一点建议：
    “秋江”既是表演爱情的真挚，那么当陈妙常赶到江边，大水横阻，艄公留难，而情人已去、难以追及，那时候，剧中人应该怀着多么怅惘、牵罣和焦急的心情呢？饰演妙常的人着重刻划的是这种心情。因此，表现妙常对于船身颠簸的惊骇，虽属必要，却不是主要的一面。剧本对于催船，也有了若干安排，演员在这方面也有了若干表演，但是看起来还是不够的。我想原因在于演员的表演大半停留于剧中人妙常和艄翁在催船问题上的具体纠缠，这一具体纠缠是为了表现主题，是完全必要的；但如果能够抓住这具体纠缠，更充分地把表演范围放宽，则表现主题的作用将更为显著。催船、行船是为了追赶前面的潘必正，这一观念在演员感情中不可淡漠或者间断。虽然潘不出场，潘的船也不可能望见，但必须把他演在戏中，因为他是这场戏的剧情发展的重要人物。因此，妙常应该时时刻刻地想到前面的潘必正，在不断地遇到困难和克服困难中，加深和变化追赶情人的感情；而艄翁也是陪衬着这种感情，更紧密地增加许多冲突和曲折，这样才会更鲜明地把主题表现出来。
