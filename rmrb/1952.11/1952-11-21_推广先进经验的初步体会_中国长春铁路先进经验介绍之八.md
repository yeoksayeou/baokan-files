    Preliminary Experience in Promoting Advanced Experience
    – Introduction to the Advanced Experience of the China Changchun Railway, Part 8
    Jia Yaoxiang, Supervisor of the Supervisory Board of the China Changchun Railway Company
    Over the past two years, the China Changchun Railway has carried out a series of tasks in promoting advanced Soviet experience. More than 4,000 employees have received training in advanced work method training classes; 36 technical research offices have been established in various stations and sections to ensure that employees have places to regularly learn advanced experience; a technology museum has been established in the Bureau; in various units of the China Changchun Railway, Soviet experts regularly introduce advanced Soviet experience and give on-site demonstrations; advanced workers Li Shusen, Hou Jingming, and Li Xikui also frequently visit various units to introduce their experiences in mastering advanced Soviet experience. Under the enthusiastic cultivation of Soviet experts, the China Changchun Railway has cultivated a large number of outstanding talents who have learned and applied advanced Soviet experience in their actual work, such as Zheng Xikun, a driver from the Sujiatun Locomotive Depot who exceeded the axle load and drove 500 kilometers, Li Xikui, the founder of the new shunting method at Shenyang Station, Yang Maolin, a loading expert from Harbin, Zhang Diankui, a dispatcher who mastered the Sudnikov dispatching method, and Guo Chunlin from the Changchun Engineering Section who applied the Nefedov track maintenance method, all of whom are nationally renowned advanced workers.
    The China Changchun Railway promotes advanced working methods under the premise of increasing production, saving expenses, improving labor productivity, reducing transportation costs, and striving to overfulfill production and financial plans. After the 1952 production and financial plan was determined, in order to effectively ensure the completion of various indicators of the production and financial plan, the China Changchun Railway Bureau immediately decided on 226 technical measures, most of which were about promoting advanced working methods. Therefore, the technical measures themselves are measures to promote advanced experience.
    On May 1st of this year, the national railway launched a movement for full loading, exceeding axle load, and 500 kilometers. In order to effectively carry out this movement, the China Changchun Railway first focused on the link of promoting advanced working methods. Various business units organized advanced work method training classes, demonstration meetings, and technical performances, and in August, a conference of advanced workers from the entire railway was held. This conference was a systematic conference to promote and summarize advanced experience, and a conference to further develop the movement for full loading, exceeding axle load, and 500 kilometers.
    Due to the promotion of advanced working methods, labor productivity has been significantly improved. In the second quarter of 1951, locomotives traveling 500 kilometers per day accounted for only 28.8 percent of all locomotives, while in the second quarter of 1952, they accounted for 53.6 percent. The tonnage of super-axle traction in the second quarter of 1952 increased by 283.9 percent compared to the second quarter of 1951. The total gross ton-kilometers in the second quarter of 1952 increased by 3.7 percent compared to the second quarter of 1951. The net deadweight in the second quarter of 1952 increased by 4.1 percent compared to the same quarter in 1951.
    The China Changchun Railway's ability to overfulfill its tasks, continuously improve labor productivity, reduce costs, and obtain surplus profits is inseparable from the promotion of a series of advanced Soviet experience. In the process of promoting advanced working methods, our experiences are:
    First, the promotion of advanced experience must have a clear guiding ideology, which is to use the highly efficient advanced working methods of the Soviet Union to improve and replace backward working methods. Therefore, the promotion of advanced experience is a meticulous political and ideological education work. The process of promoting advanced experience is a process of fighting against conservative ideas, formalism, and bureaucracy. Many people are always satisfied with outdated standards and accustomed to old ways of working. Many people are always afraid of trouble, afraid of accidents, and afraid of formulating new quotas after improving efficiency. Therefore, ideological education must be carried out through specific facts to break these obstacles. For example, after Harbin Station implemented Yang Maolin's advanced method of assigning and delivering cars by number, it strengthened joint labor and avoided manual work, thus breaking the workers' conservative thinking. They said, "I have been pushing carts for more than 20 years; since the implementation of Yang Maolin's method of assigning and delivering cars by number, I no longer push carts. This method is really good for us workers." Some technicians believe that the implementation of advanced working methods is a matter for direct production workers and has little to do with technicians. The China Changchun Railway organized technicians to go deep into workshops and groups to carry out the work of promoting advanced working methods, so that technicians and workers were combined.
    Second, to learn advanced Soviet working methods, it is also necessary to establish a high degree of patriotism and a sense of the overall situation. Zhang Diankui, a dispatcher from the Shenyang Branch, not only takes care of his own branch but also actively takes care of neighboring branches; he not only cares about how to speed up vehicles but also cares about how to effectively use locomotives. Therefore, he was able to defeat old ideas with new ideas and replace old working methods with new scientific working methods.
    Third, the promotion of advanced working methods should be combined with employees actively finding tricks and making rationalization proposals. Many advanced experiences of the China Changchun Railway were produced in this way. At the same time, advanced working methods must be continuously improved and developed according to new tasks and new situations. Yang Maolin learned advanced Soviet experience and first created a loading method, and later developed it into a collective method of assigning and delivering cars by number according to new requirements, which greatly improved the load capacity of freight cars. Because the leadership put forward the requirement of producing one million ton-kilometers per day, the locomotive department combined pulling more and running faster, further enriching the method of high-speed and super-axle loading.

    推广先进经验的初步体会
    ——中国长春铁路先进经验介绍之八
    中国长春铁路公司监事会监事  贾耀祥
    两年多来，中国长春铁路在推广苏联先进经验方面，进行了一系列的工作。在先进工作方法训练班中，有四千多名员工得到了学习；在各站、段设置了三十六个技术研究室，保证员工有经常学习先进经验的场所；在管理局设有技术馆；在中长铁路各单位，苏联专家经常介绍苏联的先进经验，并作实地示范；先进工人李树森、侯景明和李锡奎也时常到各单位介绍如何掌握苏联先进经验的经验。在苏联专家热情的培养下，中长铁路已生长了大批在实际工作中学会和运用苏联先进经验的优秀人材，像苏家屯机务段超轴、五百公里的司机郑锡坤，沈阳站新调车法创始人李锡奎，哈尔滨装车能手杨茂林，掌握了苏德尼果夫调度方法的调度员张殿魁，运用聂菲铎夫养路法的长春工务段郭春霖等，都是全国闻名的先进工作者。
    中长铁路推行先进工作方法是在增加生产、节约开支、提高劳动生产率、降低运输成本、争取更多的超额完成生产财务计划的前提下进行的。当一九五二年生产财务计划确定之后，为了有效地保证完成生产财务计划的各项指标，中长铁路管理局当即决定了二百二十六条技术措施，其中绝大部分是关于推广先进的工作方法的。因此技术措施本身就是推广先进经验的措施。
    今年五月一日全国铁路曾开展了满载、超轴、五百公里运动。中长铁路为了有效地开展这一运动，首先抓紧推广先进工作方法这一环节。各业务单位组织了先进工作方法训练班、示范会和技术表演，在八月召开了全路先进工作者会议，这次会议就是有系统地推广和总结先进经验的大会，就是进一步地开展满载、超轴、五百公里运动的大会。
    由于先进的工作方法的推广，劳动生产率获得显著提高。一九五一年第二季度每天走行五百公里的机车只占全部机车的百分之二十八点八，一九五二年第二季度却占了百分之五十三点六。一九五二年第二季度的超轴牵引吨数比一九五一年第二季度提高了百分之二百八十三点九。一九五二年第二季度的总重吨公里比一九五一年第二季度提高百分之三点七。一九五二年第二季度的净载重比一九五一年同季度提高了百分之四点一。
    中长铁路能够超额地完成任务，不断地提高劳动生产率、减低成本、获得超计划的利润，是和推广了一系列的苏联先进经验分不开的。在推广先进工作方法过程中，我们的体会是：
    第一，推广先进经验要有明确的指导思想，这就是以苏联的高度效率的先进工作方法来改进和代替落后的工作方法。因此，推广先进经验是一个细致的政治思想教育工作。推广先进经验的过程就是与保守思想、形式主义、官僚主义等作斗争的过程。许多人总是满足于陈旧的标准，习惯于老一套的工作方法。许多人总是怕麻烦、怕出事故、怕提高效率以后制订新的定额。因此，必须通过具体事实，进行思想教育，才能打破这些阻力。例如哈尔滨车站实行了先进的杨茂林对号取送车法以后，加强了联合劳动，避免了手推作业，才打破了工人的保守思想。他们说：“我工作二十多年，没有一天不推车；实行杨茂林的对号取送车法，不推车了。这个办法对我们工人实在太好了。”有些技术人员认为实行先进工作方法是直接生产工人的事，与技术人员的关系不大。中长铁路就组织了技术人员深入车间、小组，进行推广先进工作方法的工作，使技术人员与工人结合起来。
    第二，要学习苏联先进的工作方法，还须要树立高度的爱国主义思想、整体观念，沈阳分局调度员张殿奎同志不但照顾自己分局，而且主动地照顾邻分局；不但关心如何加速车辆，而且关心如何有效地运用机车，因此他能够以新的思想战胜了旧的思想，以新的科学的工作方法，代替了旧的工作方法。
    第三，推广先进工作方法，要与员工主动地找窍门、提合理化建议相结合。中长铁路许多先进经验就是这样产生的。同时，必须根据新的任务，新的情况，不断地提高和发展先进的工作方法。杨茂林学习苏联先进经验，首先创造了装车法，后来根据新的要求，又发展成为集体的对号取送车法，大大提高了货车的载重量。由于领导方面提出了每日生产一百万吨公里的要求，因之在机务方面又把多拉和快跑结合起来，更丰富了高速超轴的方法。
