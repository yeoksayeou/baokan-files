Soviet scientists, together with the entire Soviet people, are fighting to conquer nature. They are searching for new sources of power and raw materials, changing the climate, turning deserts into fertile fields, and transforming the nature of animals and plants… dedicating all their strength and knowledge to the cause of building a communist society, making great contributions to mankind. Professor Grusenko is one of the many outstanding scientists in the Soviet Union. Following the direction revealed by the Michurin doctrine, he has made creative achievements in the study of the laws of development of the plant kingdom, has twice won the Stalin Prize, published hundreds of scientific papers, enjoys high honor in the Soviet scientific community, and serves as the Scientific Secretary of the Presidium of the Soviet Academy of Sciences. Now he has come to China for another important task—to strengthen the friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people and promote cultural and scientific exchange and cooperation between the two countries.

When reporters went to visit him, this enthusiastic and energetic scientist put aside the work he was doing to receive us. He was sorting out the works of Soviet scientists, preparing to recommend them to Chinese scientific workers; at the same time, he was also planning to introduce the research reports of Chinese scientists to Soviet scientists. He said: "From Chinese scientific magazines, I know that many of the research works being carried out by Chinese scientists are very meaningful, and Soviet scientific workers will definitely be interested in them." He believes that the recent resolution of the Presidium of the Soviet Academy of Sciences on further expanding and strengthening cooperation between Chinese and Soviet scientists is very wise. He said: "Scientific workers in China and the Soviet Union should exchange information. The Soviet Academy of Sciences has decided to have specialized scientists study the research reports of Chinese scientists, select some of the more important ones and translate them into Russian; and also prepare to write outlines of the scientific works of Chinese scientists and introduce them to Soviet scientific workers. The journals published by the Soviet Academy of Sciences will publish more papers by Chinese scientists and news from the Chinese scientific community, so that Soviet scientific workers can understand the activities of the Chinese scientific community. Soviet scientific workers should read more Chinese materials, and Chinese scientific workers should read more Soviet materials, so that we can strengthen mutual contact and cooperation." Professor Grusenko's sincere words made us feel that Soviet friends are concerned about us everywhere.

Soviet science stands at the forefront of world science, which is an indisputable fact. Professor Grusenko told us that the reason why Soviet science has been able to achieve such rapid development is primarily because the Soviet socialist system guarantees the Soviet scientific community conditions that capitalist countries do not have and cannot possibly have. He said: "The Soviet socialist country, based on the science of Marxism-Leninism, cannot lack science in any aspect. The Party and the government use great care and strength to promote the development of science." He cited the expansion of Soviet research institutions to illustrate the Soviet state's emphasis on science: before the revolution, Russia had only a very small Academy of Sciences; now, in addition to the large-scale Soviet Academy of Sciences, there are the Academies of Sciences of the twelve constituent republics, the seven Academies of Sciences of various scientific departments, and hundreds of various scientific research institutes and nine hundred institutions of higher education. Today, the Soviet Academy of Sciences has sixty times the number of scientific researchers as before the revolution, a budget equivalent to seven hundred times that of before the revolution, and publishes nearly twenty-five times more scientific books than in 1917. Various scientific research institutions are training a large number of scientific workers. Currently, there are 25,000 graduate students pursuing advanced studies in the Soviet Union, and the Soviet Academy of Sciences alone has 2,500 graduate students from 58 ethnic groups striving for master's and doctoral degrees.

Professor Grusenko's own experience can illustrate how the Soviet Party and government pay attention to discovering and training young people with scientific genius to become accomplished scientists. Professor Grusenko was originally the son of a poor peasant in Ukraine. He joined the Leninist Communist Youth League at a very young age. He worked in the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Ukraine, and served as a reporter for the Ukrainian Youth League newspaper and the Ukrainian agricultural newspaper "Soviet Rural Areas." He became interested in agriculture, and later was sent by the Party to the Lysenko All-Union Institute of Selection and Genetics for advanced studies. After graduating in 1939, he worked in the Soviet Academy of Sciences. For more than ten years, he has been focusing on the study of plant genetics. In 1943, he won the Stalin Prize for successfully solving the problem of potato propagation; seven years later, he won the Stalin Prize again for publishing scientific works on asexual hybridization of plants, developing Michurin's theory, and exposing the theories of reactionary scientists. He is currently doing research at the Institute of Genetics, studying plant genetics and selection, and searching for ways to increase agricultural production.

Professor Grusenko turned the topic to the issue of the connection between science and the people. He said: "On the 35th anniversary of the October Revolution, we cannot but recall Lenin's famous saying once again: 'Formerly, all the intelligence of humankind, all its genius, created only to give all the benefits of technology and culture to a small group of people, while others were deprived of even the most essential things – education and development. But now, all the miracles of technology, all the fruits of culture will become the property of the whole people, and henceforth, at no time, will the intelligence and genius of mankind ever become a tool of atrocities, a tool of exploitation.' Today in the Soviet Union, Lenin's prediction has indeed been turned into reality. Science has become a wealth owned by the whole people, and it is closely connected with the lives of the people. This is the main difference between Soviet science and the science of capitalist countries. When scientists in capitalist countries are burying themselves in making atomic bombs and preparing for germ warfare to destroy mankind, Soviet scientists are studying the use of atomic energy to improve productivity, increase social wealth, and fight against germs that harm mankind." He also told us how Soviet scientific workers are faithfully serving the cause of communist construction. The Soviet Academy of Sciences and the Academies of Sciences of various republics are studying more than 650 important scientific issues related to communist construction, and organizing working teams led by academicians to go to various sites to conduct field investigations and research, and put forward their own opinions. He especially mentioned the work of biologists participating in the transformation of nature plan and striving for agricultural harvest. On the one hand, they study how to improve varieties and increase the area yield of cultivated land, and on the other hand, they study how to plant crops and cultivate new varieties of crops on land unsuitable for cultivation. For example, in the Caucasus region, wheat suitable for dry land was previously grown. Now that the Lenin Volga-Don Canal has been built and irrigation has developed, the varieties of wheat must be changed to make them suitable for humid soils. Soviet science is closely integrated with production and construction, and has become a powerful weapon in the great creative work of the Soviet people in building a communist society.

Professor Grusenko cited two major achievements of the Soviet biological community in recent years to illustrate how Soviet scientists rely on the methodology of dialectical materialism to study the phenomena of the natural world, reveal the specific causal relationships of various phenomena, and use experiments to check their reasoning.

Darwin's theory of "Origin of Species" believes that the mutual competition within species of animals and plants is the basis for the formation of new species. This view has long occupied a dominant position. The famous Soviet biologist Lysenko proved that the relationship within the same species is a non-antagonistic contradiction, which makes the organism thrive. There is no competition for mutual extermination between organisms of the same species, and only the mutual relationship between different species is based on antagonistic contradictions. He pointed out that the reason why the work of planting trees on the grassland had failed in the past was precisely because, according to the theory of intraspecies struggle, each tree was planted separately, and various different trees were planted, so before they grew up, they were wiped out by wild plants. Lysenko proved with extensive experiments that only by adopting the cluster planting method can forests be developed on grasslands. Professor Grusenko said: "Even a great scientist like Darwin made mistakes because he did not master dialectical materialism."

Another major contribution in biology is the new discovery by the famous biologist Lepeshinskaya on the "living matter" theory in cytology. Previous biologists believed that the cell is the only and simplest unit of life, the organism is the sum of cells, the cell only undergoes quantitative changes, new cells are only generated by the division of mother cells, and the properties of new cells and mother cells are not different. This metaphysical cell theory is completely contrary to the basic theories of Marx and Lenin on the development process of all natural phenomena. Lepeshinskaya proved in her scientific works that this idealistic and mechanistic theory is untenable. She created a new idea: cells do not necessarily have to be produced by the division of similar mother cells, but can also be developed from "living matter" with a lower organization and no cellular structure. Lepeshinskaya proved her truly materialistic cell theory with many experiments, opening up new prospects for biology and medicine. We can study the future development of organisms, fight against tumors and many other diseases, and restore injured tissues and organs of the human body.

When Professor Grusenko talked about the achievements of Soviet science, he was full of Soviet pride. He said: "Comrade Malenkov, Secretary of the Central Committee of the CPSU, pointed out in his report at the 19th National Congress of the CPSU: 'Our science plays a huge role in promoting the further development of technology; it is helping the Soviet people to understand the resources and power of nature in more detail and use them more effectively with its discoveries. In the period since the end of the war, our scientists have successfully solved many scientific problems of great national economic significance.' But we are by no means satisfied with the achievements we have already made. The Party has pointed out to our scientific workers the current task, which is to 'further develop advanced Soviet science and make it rank first in the world.' We must strive to quickly complete this glorious task." (Attached picture)

    苏联科学家为人类幸福的未来而奋斗
    ——访问苏联生物学家格鲁森科教授
    谭文瑞
    苏联的科学家和全体苏联人民一同为征服自然而奋斗。他们在寻找新的动力和原料的泉源，改变气候，变荒漠为良田，改造动植物的本性……把自己全部力量和知识献给建设共产主义社会的事业，对人类作出了巨大的贡献。格鲁森科教授就是苏联许多卓越的科学家中的一位。他由于遵循着米丘林学说所揭示的方向，在探索植物界发展法则的研究中有创造性的成就，曾两度荣获斯大林奖金，发表过数百篇科学论文，在苏联科学界享有很高的荣誉，担任着苏联科学院主席团科学秘书的职务。现在他为了另外一项重大的任务——加强中苏人民的友好，促进两国文化科学的交流和合作而来到了中国。
    当记者去访问他的时候，这一位热情而精力充沛的科学家放下他正在进行的工作来接待我们。他是在整理苏联科学家的论著，准备把它们推荐给中国的科学工作者；同时他也在计划着要把中国科学家的研究报告介绍给苏联的科学家。他说：从中国的科学杂志中晓得，中国科学家们正在进行的研究工作，有许多是很有意义的，苏联的科学工作者一定会对它们发生兴趣。他认为苏联科学院主席团最近关于进一步扩大和加强中苏科学家的合作所作的决议是非常明智的。他说：“中苏两国的科学工作者应当互通声气。苏联科学院已经决定由专门的科学家研究中国科学家的研究报告，选择一些比较主要的译成俄文；并且预备把中国科学家的科学著作写成提纲，介绍给苏联的科学工作者。苏联科学院所出版的期刊将多多登载中国科学家的论文和中国科学界的消息，使苏联的科学工作者可以了解中国科学界的活动。苏联的科学工作者多看中国的材料，中国的科学工作者多看苏联的材料，这样便能够加强相互间的联系和合作。”格鲁森科教授诚挚的言辞使我们感觉到苏联朋友处处关心着我们。
    苏联的科学站在世界科学的最前面，这已是无可争辩的事实。格鲁森科教授告诉我们，苏联的科学所以能够获得这样迅速的发展，首先是因为苏维埃社会主义制度保证了苏联科学界具备资本主义国家所没有而且也不可能有的条件。他说：“以马克思列宁主义科学为基础的苏维埃社会主义国家，在任何一方面都不能缺少科学。党和政府以极大的关怀和力量来促进科学的发展。”他举出苏联研究机构扩展的情形来说明苏维埃国家对科学的重视：在革命以前俄国只有一个很小的科学院，现在苏联除了规模宏大的苏联科学院外，还有十二个加盟共和国的科学院，七个各科学部门的科学院，另外有几百个各种科学研究所和九百个高等教育机关。今天的苏联科学院拥有等于革命前六十倍的科学研究工作者，预算相当于革命前的七百倍，出版的科学图书比一九一七年增加到将近二十五倍。各个科学研究机构培养着大量的科学工作人员，现在苏联有两万五千名在深造的研究生，单是苏联科学院就有五十八个民族的二千五百名研究生在争取硕士和博士学位。
    格鲁森科教授本人的经历就可以说明苏联的党和政府如何注意发现和培养有科学天才的青年成为有成就的科学家。格鲁森科教授原是乌克兰一个贫农的儿子，年纪很轻就参加了列宁共产主义青年团。在乌克兰共产党中央委员会中工作，当过乌克兰青年团团报和乌克兰农业报纸“苏维埃农村”的记者。他对于农业发生了兴趣，后来便由党送到李森科全苏选种遗传研究院深造，一九三九年毕业后便在苏联科学院中工作。十余年来专心从事关于植物遗传的研究，一九四三年由于成功地解决了马铃薯繁殖的问题而获得斯大林奖金；七年后又因为发表关于植物无性杂交的科学著作，发展了米丘林的学说，揭露反动科学家的理论，又一次荣获斯大林奖金。他现在在遗传学研究所里做研究工作，研究植物的遗传和选种，找寻提高农业生产的方法。
    格鲁森科教授把话题转到科学与人民联系的问题上。他说：“在十月革命三十五周年的时候，我们不能不再一次回想起列宁的名言：‘从前，全人类的智慧，它的全部天才只是为了把一切技术与文化的财富给与一小群人而创造，至于对其他人则连最必需的东西——教育和发展亦被剥夺了。可是，现在一切技术的奇迹，一切文化的成果都将成为全民的财产，并且今后无论何时，人类的智慧和天才再也不会变成暴行的工具、剥削的工具了。’今天在苏联的确已把列宁的预言变成事实，科学已成为全民所有的财富，它密切与人民的生活联系着。这就是苏联的科学与资本主义国家的科学的主要区别。当资本主义国家的科学家正在埋头制造原子弹和准备细菌战来毁灭人类的时候，苏联的科学家却是在研究利用原子能提高生产力，增加社会财富，与危害人类的细菌进行斗争。”他并且告诉我们苏联的科学工作者如何忠诚地为共产主义的建设事业服务。苏联科学院和各共和国科学院正在对六百五十多个有关共产主义建设的重要科学问题进行研究，并组织由院士领导的工作队前赴各现场去从事实地考察和研究，提出自己的意见。他特别提到生物学家参加改造自然计划和争取农业丰收的工作。他们一方面研究如何改良品种，提高耕地的面积生产量，另一方面研究如何在不适宜于耕种的土地上种植作物和栽植新种类的作物。例如在高加索地区，以前是种植宜于旱地的小麦的，现在有了列宁伏尔加河—顿河运河，发展了灌溉，就要改变小麦的品种，使它适宜于湿润的土壤。苏联的科学与生产建设密切结合，已成为苏联人民建设共产主义社会的伟大创造工作中的强大武器。
    格鲁森科教授举出苏联生物学界近年来的两个重大的成就来说明苏联的科学家是如何依靠唯物辩证法的方法论来研究自然界的现象，揭示各种现象的具体因果关系，而以实验来检查自己的推理的。
    达尔文关于“物种起源”的学说，认为动植物同种内的相互竞争是形成新种的基础，这种意见曾经长期占着统治的地位。苏联著名的生物学家李森科证明同种内的关系是一种非对抗性的矛盾，这种矛盾使生物繁荣起来。在同一种生物的相互间并没有互相消灭的竞争，只有异种生物的相互关系，才建立在对抗性的矛盾上。他指出过去在草原上植树的工作所以遭受失败，正是因为根据种内斗争的理论，每株树木都是单独栽植的，而且栽植的是各种不同的树木，所以当它们还未长大便被野生的植物消灭了。李森科以广泛实验证明了只有采用簇种法才能在草原上发展树林。格鲁森科教授说：“像达尔文这样伟大的科学家，因为没有掌握辩证唯物论，也要犯错误。”
    另一位著名的生物学家勒柏辛斯卡娅在细胞学上关于“活质”学说的新发现，是在生物学中一个非常重大的贡献。以前的生物学家认为细胞是唯一的、最简单的生命单位，有机体是细胞的总和，细胞只发生量的变化，新的细胞只是由母细胞分裂而来，新细胞和母细胞的性质没有什么不同。这种形而上学的细胞学说，是和马克思列宁关于一切自然现象发展过程的学说的基本理论完全抵触的。勒柏辛斯卡娅在自己的科学著述中证明了这种唯心论和机械论的理论不能成立。她创造了一种新的思想：细胞并不一定只能由同类的母细胞以分裂的方法产生，且还可以由组织更低级的、没有细胞结构的“活质”发展而成。勒柏辛斯卡娅以许多实验证明了她的真正唯物的细胞理论，为生物学和医学开辟了新的前途。我们可以研究生物将来的发展，可以和毒瘤等许多疾病进行斗争，可以使人体受伤的组织和器官恢复。
    当格鲁森科教授谈到苏联科学上的成就的时候，他充满着苏维埃人的自豪。他说：“联共中央委员会书记马林科夫同志在联共党第十九次代表大会上的报告中指出：‘我们的科学在促进技术的进一步发展方面起着巨大的作用；它正以它的发现来帮助苏联人民更详细地了解自然的富源和力量，并更有效地利用它们。在战争结束以后的时期中，我们的科学家已经成功地解决了许多具有巨大国民经济意义的科学问题。’但是我们绝不满足于已有的成就，党已给我们科学工作者指出当前的任务，就是‘进一步发展先进的苏维埃科学，使它在世界上居第一位。’我们必须为迅速完成这个光荣的任务而努力。”（附图片）
