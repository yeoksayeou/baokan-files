Soviet Puppet Theatre Artists and Acrobats on Chinese Art Opinions
On November 11th, Chinese theatre workers Zhang Geng and Wu Xue visited the members of the Soviet Art Work Group, the artistic director of the Soviet Puppet Theatre, People's Artist of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, and Stalin Prize winner, Obraztsov. Mr. Obraztsov first introduced the development of the Soviet puppet theatre. He said: The Soviet Union only began establishing puppet theatres after the October Revolution, and now it has developed to more than 100 theatres. Puppet theatres are dedicated to performances for children during the day because children watching plays at night will affect their sleep and easily produce hallucinations. At night, they perform for adults. The characteristic of puppet theatre is that it is good at using comedic forms to express educational themes for children. During the Great Patriotic War, sixteen puppet troupes went to the front lines and field hospitals, and were very popular among soldiers and the wounded.

Obraztsov believes that hand puppets are more convenient than marionettes. Hand puppets can be used freely, "as if living in my body," while marionettes are not flexible enough and are only suitable for performing some dance movements.

He attaches great importance to Chinese puppet shows. He treasures the Chinese puppet and the photos of the Liaoxi puppet show that were presented to him by Chinese theatre workers. He said: "The Soviet National Puppet Theatre has collected puppets from various countries, but not from China (only Chinese donkey shadow puppets). This is very regrettable." He hopes that China can start establishing new puppet theatres soon. He said: "Your new puppet theatres must be built on the basis of your inherent puppet theatre art. Your puppet theatre art heritage must be very rich, and you will definitely have a new world when you establish new puppet theatres." After watching Peking Opera, he believes that many scenes and characters in Chinese Peking Opera are very suitable for adapting into puppet shows, such as the teacher in "The Fisherman's Revenge," which can be adapted into a puppet show to let the audience laugh at him. He plans to adapt some scenes and characters from Chinese Peking Opera into puppet shows after returning to his country.

Obraztsov talked about his impressions and opinions on Chinese art. He especially liked the performance of "The Tale of the White Snake" by the Opera Experimental School, believing that it was not easy for children to perform so wonderfully. However, he thought that one thing was not very good—the actors used flags to symbolically represent water, but the background was a real water scene, which seemed inconsistent. He believes that the Opera Experimental School has general cultural courses such as music and fine arts in addition to drama courses, which is very good, so that children can receive a comprehensive education. He said that during his trip to China, he saw Chinese people dancing lions, and he was surprised, believing that such folk art heritage should be valued as extremely precious.

In order to learn from the Soviet puppet theatre art, the All-China Drama Workers Association specially invited Obraztsov to perform puppet shows for the literary and art circles on November 13th, and also performed several Chinese puppet shows for him to watch, and asked him to give his opinions on Chinese puppet shows.

Chinese acrobats Yang Xiaoting and Yin Hong visited Soviet acrobats the Putchin couple (members of the Soviet Art Work Group) on November 11th.

Putchin talked about the development of the Soviet circus. He said: In the old Russian era, circus performers, like Chinese actors, were also wandering around. Now there are fifty circuses in the Soviet Union, and the state has also established a circus school. Before 1934, Soviet circus did not have a unified organization. In 1934, the government established the Circus Administration Bureau.

They highly praised our country's acrobatics, especially the "Top Jar" act, believing that it is also among the best in the world. They very much hope to see our country's circus. Finally, they hope that our acrobats, when learning or practicing, should not be greedy for more, and should not be like actors in capitalist countries, who are afraid of not being able to eat and make themselves proficient in everything, but not proficient in anything.

### 苏联木偶戏艺术家和杂技家对中国艺术的意见

    苏联木偶戏艺术家和杂技家对中国艺术的意见
    我国戏剧工作者张庚、吴雪等于十一月十一日访问苏联艺术工作团团员、苏联木偶戏剧院艺术指导、俄罗斯苏维埃联邦社会主义共和国人民演员、斯大林奖金获得者奥布拉兹卓夫。奥氏首先介绍了苏联木偶剧的发展情况。他说：苏联在十月革命后才开始建立木偶剧院，现在已发展到一百多座。木偶剧院白天专为儿童演出，因为儿童在夜里看戏会影响他们的睡眠时间，且易产生幻觉。夜里则为成人演出。木偶剧的特点是善于用喜剧的形式表现教育儿童的主题。在卫国战争期间，有十六个木偶剧团到前线及战地医院，很受战士及伤病员的欢迎。
    奥布拉兹卓夫认为手拿的木偶比提线的木偶方便，手拿的木偶可以运用自如，“像生活在我身体内一样”，提线的却不够灵活，只适于表现一些舞蹈的动作。
    他很重视中国的木偶戏。对我国戏剧工作者赠送给他的中国木偶一个及辽西木偶剧照片，极为珍爱。他说：“在苏联国立木偶戏剧院收集有各国的木偶，却没有中国的（仅有中国的驴皮影）。这是很遗憾的事情。”他希望中国能很快地着手建立新木偶剧，他说：“你们的新木偶剧一定要建立在你们固有的木偶剧艺术的基础上。你们的木偶剧艺术遗产，一定很丰富，你们建立起新木偶剧来，一定会有一番新天地。”他看过京剧后，认为中国京剧中的许多场面和人物很适合于改作木偶剧，如“打渔杀家”中的教师爷，就很可以改作成木偶剧，让观众嘲笑他一下。他打算回国后将中国京剧中的某些场面和人物编成木偶剧演出。
    奥布拉兹卓夫谈到对中国艺术的观感和意见。他特别喜欢戏曲实验学校的京戏“白蛇传”的演出，认为小孩子能演到这样精彩的程度，实在不容易。不过他以为有一点不大好——演员用旗帜来象征地表现水，但后边的布景却又是真实的水的布景，这样就显得不统一了。他认为戏曲实验学校除了戏剧课程之外，还设有音乐、美术等一般文化课程，是很好的，这样可以使小孩子受到全面的教育。他说他在来中国的旅途中，看到中国人民在舞狮子，他很惊奇，认为像这样的民间艺术遗产是应该加以重视的极可宝贵的东西。
    为了向苏联木偶剧艺术学习，中华全国戏剧工作者协会于十一月十三日特请奥布拉兹卓夫专为文艺界表演木偶剧，同时演出了几出中国的木偶剧给他看，并请他对中国的木偶剧提意见。
    中国杂技家杨小亭、尹宏于十一月十一日访问苏联杂技家普奇岑夫妇（苏联艺术工作团团员）。
    普奇岑谈到苏联马戏团的发展情况，他说：旧俄时代马戏演员和中国演员一样，也是到处流浪。现在苏联有五十个马戏场，而且国家还成立了马戏学校。苏联马戏在一九三四年前没有统一组织，一九三四年政府设立了马戏管理总局。
    他们对我国的杂技极为称赞，特别推崇顶坛子，认为这在世界上也是属于第一位的。他们很希望能看到我国的马戏。最后他们希望我们的杂技演员，在学习或练习的时候不要贪多，不要像资本主义国家的演员，怕吃不上饭而使自己样样皆通，却样样都不精。
