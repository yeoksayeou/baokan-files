    To the Editor: Recently, Rushan County, Shandong Province, organized fifteen cadres at the section chief level and above to inspect autumn plowing in various districts. They discovered many problems and exposed the serious bureaucratic and red-tape style of leadership in the past. In the past, the county assigned work to the districts, the districts assigned work to the townships, and the townships held a meeting for assignment, and that was it. Each level simply passed on the message when assigning tasks. They not only failed to combine it with the specific conditions of the local area and point out specific methods, but sometimes they themselves did not understand it clearly before assigning it. The Communist Party of China's Second District Committee wrote letters to the village branches to convey the county party committee's instructions, and actually wrote "advocate reasonable fertilization" as "advocate but complete current fertilization." Such instruction letters often were not even looked at in the villages; even if they were read, it was difficult to implement them. The Ninth District created a set of "Autumn Plowing Progress Charts," which had to be tallied every day, and the township cadres were busy dealing with the statistical forms all day long. District cadres who went to the townships to inspect work only wanted numbers and did not conduct on-the-spot investigations. If the numbers reported by the township cadres were large, they would happily report them upwards; if the numbers reported were small, they would be criticized without asking for the reasons. As a result, some townships falsely reported achievements, forming a habit of reporting good news but not bad. The cadres in the Tenth District also inspected work in a "messenger" style, riding their bicycles to each township to get the numbers and that was it. They did not know what the mass production situation was like. This time, when the county sent people to Jingkou Township to inspect work, they asked the township cadres about the production situation. The township cadres said "manure has been universally delivered"; however, when they went to the villages to take a look, the manure piles had not been touched. When they asked the Sha Baoshan mutual aid group in Shajia Village how they exchanged labor at equal value, they said: "When reporting to the township, we have to say it is an equal value exchange; in fact, everyone is from the same village, what is there to haggle over!" When asked why there were only two fake mutual aid groups in this village, the township head said: "To tell the truth, the district cadres ride their bicycles to ask for numbers every day. Our township has four villages, and I can't even get the numbers if I run to one village a day, so I can only make up fake numbers." This situation exists in every district and township. The root cause lies in the serious task-oriented viewpoint and bureaucratic work style of the county and district leading cadres, who have always regarded cadres who can report large numbers as good cadres, but do not provide concrete solutions to the difficulties and problems reflected by the lower levels. After this inspection, everyone's minds have cleared up a lot, and they are determined to change their work style, go deep into the lower levels, strengthen inspection, clean up the documents and forms, cancel all those that are useless, and change the red-tape method of issuing instructions level by level without any changes; the districts will no longer issue written instructions to the villages, but will strengthen specific leadership over the township and village cadres.

    深入基层检查工作使我们的头脑清醒了
    编辑同志：山东乳山县最近组织了科长以上干部十五人，到各区检查秋耕工作，发现了许多问题，暴露了过去领导方面的严重的官僚主义、文牍主义作风。过去县里把工作布置到区里，区里布置到乡里，乡里再召开一个布置会，就算完事了。各级往下布置任务只是照样传话，不但不能结合本地具体情况，指出具体办法，而且有时自己也没有弄清楚，就布置下去了。中共二区区委向各村支部写信传达县委的指示，竟把“提倡合理施肥”写成了“提但全现施肥”。这样的指示信到了村里，常常根本没有人看；就是看了也难执行。第九区制造了一套“秋耕进度表”，每天要统计一次，乡干部整天忙于应付统计表格。区干部到各乡检查工作，只要数字，不作实地调查。乡干部报的数字大，就高高兴兴地往上报；报的数字小，就不问情由地批评一顿。于是，有些乡就假报成绩，形成报喜不报忧。第十区的干部检查工作，也是“交通员”式的，骑着车子到各乡把数目字要来就算完事。群众生产情形究竟怎么样？并不知道。这次县里派人到井口乡检查工作时，问乡干部生产情况，乡干部说“已经普遍送粪了”；可是到各村一看，粪堆都没有动。到沙家村问沙保善互助组是怎样等价换工的，他们说：“向乡里汇报，不能不说是等价交换；其实，都是一个村的人，计较什么！”问乡长为什么这个村里只有两个假互助组，乡长说：“说实话吧，区干部天天骑着车子来要数字，我们乡四个村，我一天跑一个村也弄不出数目字来，只能造假数目字。”这种情况，各区各乡都有。根源就在于县区领导干部有严重的单纯任务观点和官僚主义作风，一向把能报上大数字的干部认为是好干部，对于下面反映的困难问题，却不给具体解决。经过这一次检查，大家头脑清醒了许多，决心转变作风，深入下层，加强检查，把文件、表格加以清理，没用处的一律取消，并改变一级一级原样不动地下达指示的文牍主义办法；区不再给村下书面指示，而要加强对乡、村干部的具体领导。
