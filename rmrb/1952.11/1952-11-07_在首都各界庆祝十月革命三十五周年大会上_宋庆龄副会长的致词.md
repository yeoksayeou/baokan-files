Comrades:

Today, we celebrate the 35th anniversary of the Soviet October Socialist Revolution with the warmest feelings. At the same time, we welcome the Soviet cultural workers delegation headed by Comrade Tikhonov, the Soviet art workers delegation headed by Comrade Tsuraki, the Soviet Red Flag Song and Dance Ensemble headed by Comrade Alexandrov, and the Soviet film art workers delegation headed by Comrade Fedorov to Beijing. From the 35th anniversary of the great Soviet Socialist Revolution, that is, from November 7th to December 6th, we will hold a "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month" throughout the country to strengthen the friendly alliance between China and the Soviet Union. We warmly welcome Soviet friends to participate in this grand "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month."

In the past thirty-five years, under the leadership of Marshal Stalin, the heroic Soviet people have defeated the armed intervention of the imperialists, annihilated the offensive of fascist Germany, and built the world's first socialist country through continuous efforts and unyielding struggles. They are now marching towards a communist society. Such brilliant achievements of the Soviet people have given us Chinese people and the people of the world great encouragement and infinite hope.

Under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, the Chinese people have struggled for many years and finally established a people's democratic regime. We are striving to build a new democratic society with the achievements of the Soviet Union today as our vision, so as to move towards socialism and finally reach a communist society. Therefore, like other people's democratic countries, we are learning from the Soviet Union's construction experience with great enthusiasm.

The "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month" we are holding this time is indeed of great significance. That is, while celebrating the 35th anniversary of the socialist revolution, we are also conducting a very extensive and powerful education in our country, so that the Chinese people know the bright future of socialism. A large number of Soviet friends have come to China at this time, and the friendship between us will inevitably be further enhanced and consolidated.

In the past three years, our friendship has continued to grow in all aspects. Your experts have worked tirelessly, demonstrated the spirit of internationalism, and helped us in various construction undertakings. We deeply realize that we can only move forward by leaps and bounds with your help. From our experience, we know that all people's democratic countries must rely on your advanced help. Without your profound friendship in this way of displaying internationalism, it is absolutely impossible for the entire human race to improve upwards at an unprecedented speed.

This "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month" is to further promote the study of the advanced experience of the Soviet Union in nation-building. Soviet comrades, your arrival is just right. We welcome you all over the country and want to ask you for various guidance. Our workers, farmers, youth, students, women, government workers, scientific and technical workers, literary and art workers, and business circles all warmly welcome you.

Sino-Soviet friendship is undoubtedly an important link in promoting the world peace movement. Your arrival in our country this time will not only promote the significance of peace, but also make greater contributions to the movement to save peace. The result of our joint efforts will surely be satisfactory, precisely because our common goal is to seek happiness for the people of the world. Friends, you bear a great mission, and we have supreme friendship with you. Let us once again, on behalf of the entire Chinese people, express our most sincere welcome to you.

    在首都各界庆祝十月革命三十五周年大会上
    宋庆龄副会长的致词同志们：
    今天我们以最热烈的心情来庆祝苏联十月社会主义革命三十五周年，同时欢迎以吉洪诺夫同志为首的苏联文化工作者代表团，以楚拉基同志为首的苏联艺术工作团，以亚历山大罗夫同志为首的苏军红旗歌舞团，以及以费道罗夫同志为首的苏联电影艺术工作者代表团来到北京。从伟大的苏联社会主义革命三十五周年纪念日，即十一月七日至十二月六日止，我们在全国范围内举行“中苏友好月”，借以加强中苏两国的友好同盟。我们热烈地欢迎苏联友人来参加这次盛大的“中苏友好月”。
    三十五年来，英勇的苏联人民在斯大林大元帅领导下，击溃了帝国主义者的武装干涉，歼灭了法西斯德国的进攻，再接再厉、百折不挠地建设成了世界上第一个社会主义的国家，现在正向共产主义社会迈进。苏联人民的这种光辉成就给予我们中国人民和全世界的人民莫大的鼓励和无穷的希望。
    中国人民在英明的毛主席领导下进行多年的斗争，终于建立了人民民主政权。我们正以苏联今日的成就为我们的远景，努力建设新民主主义的社会，从而走向社会主义，最后达到共产主义的社会。因此，我们和其他人民民主国家一样，用高度的热情学习苏联的建设经验。
    我们这次举行的“中苏友好月”确有重大的意义。那就是在庆祝社会主义革命的三十五周年，同时在我国进行一次很广泛很有力的教育，使得中国人民都知道社会主义的美好前途。大队苏联朋友此时来到中国，我们间的友谊必然会得到进一步的增强和巩固。
    最近三年来，我们的友谊在各方面都有不断的增长。你们的专家们不辞劳苦，发挥了国际主义的精神，帮助了我们进行各种建设事业。我们深深体会到，只有凭借你们的帮助，才能大踏步地前进。从我们的经验，就知道一切人民民主国家都要依靠你们先进的帮助。没有你们的这样发挥国际主义的深厚的友谊，整个人类以史无前例的速度向上提高是绝对不可能的。
    这次“中苏友好月”就是要进一步地推动对于苏联建国先进经验的学习。苏联的同志们，你们来得正好。我们全国各地都欢迎你们，并且要请你们作种种指教。我们的工人、农民、青年、学生、妇女、机关工作者、科学和技术工作者、文艺工作者以及工商界，都热烈欢迎你们。
    中苏友谊无疑地是推进世界和平运动的一个重要环节。诸位朋友这次来到我国，不但会发扬和平的意义，并且在拯救和平的运动上将有更大的贡献。我们共同努力的结果必定是圆满的，正因为我们共同的目标是为全世界人民谋幸福的。朋友们，你们负着重大的使命，我们对你们有无上的友谊。让我们再一次代表全中国人民向你们表示最诚恳的欢迎。
