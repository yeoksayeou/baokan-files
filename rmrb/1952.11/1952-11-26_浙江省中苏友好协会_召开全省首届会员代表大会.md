    Zhejiang Province Sino-Soviet Friendship Association
    Convenes First Provincial Congress of Members
    (Xinhua News Agency dispatch) The Zhejiang Province Sino-Soviet Friendship Association convened its first provincial congress of members from November 16th to 22nd. The central content of the meeting was to discuss how to deeply promote the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month" activities throughout the province, as well as the development and consolidation of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association's organization.

    The meeting summarized the achievements of the Zhejiang Province Sino-Soviet Friendship Association in various work over the past three years. The Sino-Soviet Friendship Association at all levels in the province has now established more than 3,700 grassroots organizations, with more than 1,020,000 members. In terms of carrying out publicity and education work, the exhibition of Soviet photos alone has been held more than 3,000 times, with more than 4,400,000 viewers. The people of the province have also launched a campaign of correspondence with Soviet friends. These are all favorable conditions for carrying out the current "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month" activities.

    The meeting listened to reports by Tan Qilong, President of the Zhejiang Province Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, and Lin Hujia, Vice President, as well as typical introductions of "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month" activities carried out by rural areas, factories, organs, schools, and other units throughout the province. The participating representatives discussed these reports in connection with their own thinking and local conditions, and exchanged work experiences with each other.

    The meeting emphasized that the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month" activities should become a driving force for promoting all current work. Therefore, in rural areas, the publicity activities of "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month" should be closely combined with the current work of summarizing, evaluating, promoting experience in achieving high yields, and consolidating and developing mutual aid and cooperative organizations.

    The meeting requested that representatives, after returning, should launch the publicity of "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month" extensively in the vast rural areas as soon as possible, and requested that through this publicity activity, more than 80% of the province's population can be educated. The Sino-Soviet Friendship Associations in various regions should develop a large number of members, improve grassroots organizations, strengthen regular work, and establish various organizations for learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union.

    The meeting finally re-elected the president, vice presidents, and the board of directors of the Zhejiang Province Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, and adjusted the organizational structure of the executive committee.

    浙江省中苏友好协会
    召开全省首届会员代表大会
    据新华社讯：浙江省中苏友好协会于十一月十六日到二十二日召开全省第一届会员代表大会。会议的中心内容是讨论在全省范围内如何深入开展“中苏友好月”活动以及发展和巩固中苏友好协会的组织问题。
    会议总结了三年来浙江省中苏友好协会各项工作成绩。全省各级中苏友好协会现已建立了三千七百多个基层组织，拥有会员一百零二万多人。在开展宣传教育工作方面，仅举办苏联图片展览一项就曾达三千多次，观众有四百四十多万人。全省人民还展开了和苏联友人通信的运动。这些都是目前开展“中苏友好月”活动的有利条件。
    会议听取了浙江省中苏友好协会会长谭启龙、副会长林乎加的报告，以及全省各地农村、工厂、机关、学校等单位开展“中苏友好月”活动的典型介绍。与会代表联系自己思想和当地情况讨论了这些报告，互相交流了工作经验。
    会议着重指出：“中苏友好月”活动应成为推动当前一切工作的动力。因此，在农村中应把“中苏友好月”的宣传活动和当前的总结、评比、推广丰产经验和巩固发展互助合作组织等工作密切结合起来。
    会议要求：代表们回去之后应尽早在广大农村中广泛展开“中苏友好月”的宣传，并要求通过这一宣传活动，使全省百分之八十以上的人口能受到教育。各地中苏友好协会应大量发展会员，健全基层组织，加强经常工作，建立学习苏联先进经验的各种组织。
    会议最后改选了浙江省中苏友好协会正副会长和理事会，并调整了干事会的组织机构。
