Continuing to Support the Chinese People's Volunteers
——Summary of Readers' Letters

Around the second anniversary of the Chinese People's Volunteers' participation in the war abroad, the editorial department of this newspaper received many letters from readers entrusted to this newspaper to be forwarded to the Volunteers. In these letters, the people of the motherland tell their loyal protectors – the Volunteers – about their happy lives and express their strong will to support the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea.

The entire staff of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant in Beijing wrote to the Volunteers, saying: As the second anniversary of your going abroad approaches, our plant's campaign to increase production and practice economy has reached another climax. From September to now, employees have proposed a total of 2,177 rationalization suggestions, of which only 83 can save the country more than 2.6 billion yuan in wealth. A certain iron furnace overfulfilled the production plan by 36.7 percent. The coking department completed the annual production task of a certain by-product as early as September 3. Currently, our slogan is: Ensure the realization of the annual increase of 11.27 percent of the task, and continue to support the Volunteers. The entire staff of the Shenyang No. 12 Machinery Factory wrote to the Volunteers, saying: In the past two years, inspired by your patriotic spirit, we have worked hard to promote advanced production experience, and production efficiency has increased unprecedentedly. This year, the higher authorities asked us to increase production equivalent to 8,700 tons of grain, which can not only be fully completed, but also overfulfilled by more than six times. The production efficiency of military family member Mo Jingde has increased from 60 pieces per day to 180 pieces, and the scrap rate has dropped from 50 percent to 9.24 percent. The scale of our factory has expanded, and the number of employees is eighty times more than when it was first liberated. The lives of workers have also improved. People with tattered clothes, ragged pants, and sallow and thin faces have disappeared in our factory. There are four or five thousand kinds of books and newspapers, two movie projectors, and thirteen cows in the factory. There is also a large broadcasting station, sanatorium, nursery, and school. Recently, many new dormitories and bathhouses have been built. All convalescents of the Second Hospital of Longyan Iron Mine wrote: In addition to ensuring good recuperation, returning to health as soon as possible, and returning to the production front, we also donated more than one million yuan to comfort the Volunteers.

Wang Shikun, an anti-aircraft gunner of a certain unit of the Volunteers who was wounded and returned to China for recuperation last July, said in a letter to his comrades: "The enemy's artillery fire can only destroy my body, and it will never destroy my will. My blood is still boiling, and I feel that my fighting will is stronger than before. The Party and the people of the motherland have established schools for disabled revolutionary soldiers for us, and invited model teachers to cultivate and educate us. This is a good opportunity to improve our political and cultural level. I will seize this opportunity to learn skills and master technology, and fight the common enemy with you on the construction front of the motherland."

The Correspondence Group of Beijing Normal University, Cai Shaoyuan, Han Shaoxin, and Zhao Jinxiu of Beijing Railway College, and Xie Rongshi of Beijing University of Political Science and Law all expressed their intention to study Marxism-Leninism hard, exercise, and continue to support the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea.

    继续支援人民志愿军
    ——读者来信综述
    在志愿军出国作战两周年前后，本报编辑部接到了许多读者托本报转给志愿军的信件。在这些信件里，祖国人民向自己的忠实保卫者——志愿军述说着自己的幸福生活，并表示自己支援抗美援朝战争的坚强意志。
    北京市石景山钢铁厂全体职工写给志愿军的信上说：你们出国两周年快要到来时，我厂增产节约运动又一次达到了高潮。九月到现在，职工共提出合理化建议二千一百七十七件，仅其中八十三件就能给国家节约二十六亿余万元的财富。某铁炉超额完成了增产计划百分之三十六点七。炼焦部于九月三日就完成了某种副产品的全年生产任务。目前，我们的口号是：保证实现全年增产百分之十一点二七的任务，继续支援志愿军。沈阳市机械十二厂全体职工给志愿军的信中说：两年来，在你们的爱国主义精神的鼓舞下，我们努力推广先进生产经验，生产效率空前提高。今年上级要我们增产折合八千七百吨粮食的任务，不但可全部完成，并且可超额完成六倍以上。军属莫景德生产效率由日产六十件提高到一百八十件，废品率由百分之五十降到百分之九点二四。我们厂的规模扩大了，职工人数比刚解放时多了八十倍。工人的生活也改善了，破衣烂裤、面黄肌瘦的人在咱厂已经绝迹了。厂内有各种书报四、五千册，电影机两台，奶牛十三头。并设有大型的广播站、休养所、托儿所、学校。最近又新修建了许多宿舍和澡塘。龙烟铁矿第二医院全体休养员写道：我们除了保证好好休养，早日恢复健康，重新走上生产战线外，并捐献一百余万元慰问志愿军。
    于去年七月负伤回国休养的志愿军某部高射炮手王世崑，在给战友们的信上说：“敌人的炮火只能摧残我的身体，永远毁灭不了我的意志。我的血还在沸腾，我觉得我的战斗意志比以前更坚强了。党和祖国人民已经给我们建立起了荣誉军人学校，又请了模范教师来培养教育我们。这是提高政治和文化水平的良好机会。我一定抓紧这个时机，学好本领，掌握技术，在祖国的建设战线上和你们一块打击共同的敌人。”
    北京师范大学通讯组，北京铁道学院蔡绍源、韩绍信、赵锦绣以及北京政法学院谢荣世的信中，都表示要努力学习马克思、列宁主义，锻炼身体，继续支援抗美援朝战争。
