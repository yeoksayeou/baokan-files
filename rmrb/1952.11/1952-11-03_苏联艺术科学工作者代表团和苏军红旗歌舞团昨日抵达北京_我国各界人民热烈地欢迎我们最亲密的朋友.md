    Also present at the station to welcome them were Gudev, Chargé d'Affaires of the Soviet Embassy in China, and Efimov, a member of the Soviet Art and Science Workers Delegation currently in Beijing.
    The Soviet Art and Science Workers Delegation and all members of the Soviet Army Red Flag Song and Dance Ensemble arrived at Beijing Railway Station on two trains at 2:50 PM and 3:10 PM respectively. Tikhonov and all members of the Soviet Art and Science Workers Delegation and the Soviet Army Red Flag Song and Dance Ensemble stepped off the train amidst warm applause and cheers, and accepted flowers presented by 150 Young Pioneers.
    A grand welcoming ceremony was held in the station square. A huge portrait of Chairman Mao Zedong and Marshal Stalin stood on the welcoming platform. The welcoming ceremony began with the music of "Moscow-Beijing." Guo Moruo delivered a welcoming speech, and Tikhonov delivered a reply. The welcoming crowd was deeply inspired by their speeches, constantly waving flowers and colored flags, and shouting, "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live Stalin!" "Stalin-Mao Zedong!" "Stalin-Mao Zedong!"
    In his welcoming speech, Guo Moruo first extended a warm welcome on behalf of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association and the Chinese people to the Soviet Art and Science Workers Delegation and the Soviet Army Red Flag Song and Dance Ensemble who had come from afar, not sparing any effort. He said, "I warmly welcome you because you are the envoys of the Soviet people, the most loyal friends of the Chinese people. You are the envoys sent by the great Marshal Stalin. Through you, the friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people will be further consolidated and developed." He said: The Chinese people, from their own long-term personal experience, deeply realize the consistent brotherly friendship and assistance of the Soviet people to the Chinese people, and deeply realize the great significance of the friendly cooperation between the Chinese and Soviet people for safeguarding Far Eastern and world peace and creating a free and happy new life. The great Sino-Soviet alliance is a strong fortress of world peace. He said: The Soviet Union's today is our tomorrow. The Soviet Union's road is our road. The Chinese people, on the eve of large-scale construction, especially need to further learn from the Soviet Union and especially need to further strengthen Sino-Soviet friendship. The arrival of the Soviet Art and Science Workers Delegation and the Soviet Army Red Flag Song and Dance Ensemble will surely play a major role in the further development and consolidation of the great Sino-Soviet friendship. Guo Moruo wished the delegation brilliant achievements in promoting friendly cooperation between the Chinese and Soviet people. Guo Moruo finally shouted, "Long live the unbreakable friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people!" "Long live Chairman Mao Zedong, the great leader of the Chinese people!" "Long live Marshal Stalin, the closest friend of the Chinese people, the great leader and teacher of the working people of the whole world!"
    In his speech, Tikhonov first said, "Please allow me, on behalf of the Soviet art and science workers, the Soviet Army Red Flag Song and Dance Ensemble, and the Soviet people, to extend the most cordial, the most sublime, and brotherly greetings to the Chinese people! I represent the glorious Moscow to extend the most cordial greetings to Beijing, the capital of the glorious New China!" Tikhonov said, "We are in days illuminated by two major events. This is the third anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, which was celebrated not long ago, and the thirty-fifth anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution in the Soviet Union, which will be celebrated soon. A long time has passed since the October Revolution. As Comrade Stalin said, we are no longer a 'shock brigade.' Shoulder to shoulder with us is the brave and powerful Chinese 'shock brigade'. The people of our two countries are time-tested, close friends with deep friendship." Tikhonov went on to say: Domestic and foreign life in the Soviet Union follows one principle: everything is for the defense of peace. The first decree of the Soviet regime after its birth was the decree on peace. Since that time, all our undertakings, culture, art, and science have served peace. Tikhonov said, "We are honored to be able to come to China today as envoys of Soviet culture. We will do everything possible to see more of China, to see its achievements, and to introduce to the Chinese people the life, art, and scientific achievements of the Soviet people, in order to further strengthen and consolidate the friendship and cooperation between our two peoples!" In concluding his speech, Tikhonov shouted, "Long live the invincible friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people!" "Long live Chairman Mao Zedong, the great leader of the Chinese people!" "Long live Stalin, the great leader and teacher of the people of the whole world!"
    After the speeches, the Young Pioneers once again represented the people of the capital and presented flowers to Tikhonov and all members of the Soviet Art and Science Workers Delegation and the Soviet Army Red Flag Song and Dance Ensemble.
    The welcoming ceremony ended with the music of "The Hearts of the People of the World Are One."
    At 8 p.m., Qian Junrui, Secretary-General of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, hosted a banquet to welcome the Soviet Art and Science Workers Delegation and the Soviet Army Red Flag Song and Dance Ensemble.
    The other three members of the Soviet Art and Science Workers Delegation—Ulanova, Kondratov, and Zaitseva—will arrive in Beijing by plane from Moscow within the next few days.
    Xinhua News Agency, November 2nd: The Soviet Art and Science Workers Delegation and the Soviet Army Red Flag Song and Dance Ensemble received a warm welcome when they stopped briefly at the stations in Harbin, Shenyang, Tianjin, and other places on their way from Manchuria to Beijing. Gathered at the station to greet them were local military and government leaders, heads of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, and representatives of people from all walks of life, ranging from over a thousand to several thousand people. As the train entered the station, people waved flowers and shouted "Stalin," "Mao Zedong," and "Long live Sino-Soviet friendship." A welcoming ceremony was also held at the station, and the flowers presented by the Young Pioneers of Harbin filled Tikhonov's arms. Artists from Harbin and Shenyang performed wonderful programs with Chinese national flavor for the Soviet guests, such as waist drums, lion dances, torch dances, and peace drum dances. Actors from the Tianjin People's Art Theater and Soviet artists held a get-together on the platform. As the train was about to start, the jubilant crowd gathered in front of the train and sang "Moscow-Beijing" and "March of the Motherland." The delegates stood at the train door and waved, throwing flowers into the crowd. Some delegates shouted "Goodbye" in Chinese. (Attached pictures)
