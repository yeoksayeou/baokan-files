    Xigou Village Peasants Find the Direction for Mountainous Area Production Development
    Some people talk about how Xigou Village in Pingshun County, Shanxi Province, led by Li Shunda, changed from poor to rich, and they are full of admiration; but when it comes to the future, because Xigou Village's natural conditions for agricultural development are not good, they can't help but worry about its future. This kind of thinking was also prevalent among the farmers of Xigou Village in the spring of 1951. How to continue to improve production? Most of the manpower and animal power in Xigou Village have already been organized; in terms of farming technology, the three plows, three hoeings, warm water seed soaking, and medicated seed mixing advocated by the government have all been implemented, and new-style walking plows have also been used; as for tractors? According to the villagers, there is "not even a leg for a machine to stand on"; after thinking about it, people said: "No matter how much we increase production, we won't be able to increase it by much."
    Even if there was no way, they had to find a way. All the villagers put a lot of thought into continuing to develop production. Some people had this idea: to develop production, they had to move to places with better natural conditions. Therefore, in the spring of 1951, Li Shunda proposed a sensational "relocation plan." In October of that year, Li Shunda went to Beijing to participate in the National Day celebrations and met Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao advised him not to move and pointed out the direction of integrated development of agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry. Li Shunda's "relocation plan" was completely abandoned at this time. The peasants of Xigou Village clarified the correct direction for continuing to develop mountainous area production, and the production mood temporarily stabilized.
    After the autumn of 1951, everyone bought eight mares and four cows and donkeys respectively, and planted some trees. However, everyone felt that this kind of development was too slow. They calculated: a female animal produces two foals in three years, which is not even as good as the income of one mu of high-yielding cotton in the plain area in one year; the income from forestry is unknown how many years it will take; and now there is no strength to raise a large number of livestock and sheep. At this time, several households in the village, such as Sang Yunhe, Li Decai, and Guo Baoshan, wanted to move.
    This spring, the State Council of the Central People's Government issued instructions to strengthen the work in the old revolutionary base areas. At that time, some people in Xigou Village were about to move and go out to make a living. Li Lin, deputy secretary of the Pingshun County Party Committee of the Communist Party of China, came to Xigou Village and persuaded five farmers who were going out to make a living to hold off for the time being; he also concentrated his efforts to mobilize the masses to formulate a three-year construction plan.
    Before formulating the plan, the Xigou Village Branch of the Communist Party of China and the Village People's Government mobilized all party members, cadres, and the masses to study the State Council's instructions on strengthening the work in the old revolutionary base areas, watched the slides of the Soviet "Red October Collective Farm," and recalled the past poverty and today's liberation in Xigou Village, which enhanced everyone's confidence in building the mountainous area. Then, Comrade Li Lin personally led all the village cadres, party members, and some of the masses to actually inspect all the terraced fields, mountain gullies, forest slopes, and river滩 (tan). They initially discovered that there were three places where small reservoirs could be built, one place where wells could be dug, and three places where mountain gullies could be dammed. As long as these doable things were done, Xigou Village, where even drinking water was difficult, could have paddy fields. During the inspection of the forest slopes, they found that the pine and cypress slope behind Shatuo (a natural village in Xigou Village) already had large pine trees with bowl-thick trunks, and the smaller ones could be used to make hoe handles. As long as they were pruned and managed in a planned way, the forest slope would become a forest. Xigou Village is very scattered (there are nine mountain villages in the whole village), and most of the land is terraced (there are about two thousand terraces in total). Around each mountain village and on both sides of each terraced field, various fruit trees grow. The walnut trees planted by Song Jinshan ten years ago can now produce two to five dou of walnuts per tree per year. The apricot trees planted by Li Shunda three years ago can now sell more than two dan of apricot kernels per year. More than a dozen jujube trees grafted this spring bore red dates in the same year. These vivid facts show that Xigou Village has ample conditions for developing forests and orchards. During the inspection of the river滩 and barren slopes, they found that there was a large area of river滩 at the entrance of the village, which could be turned into river滩 land, and a large area of barren slopes could be afforested and grazed. This also shows that Xigou Village has huge potential for developing production. When formulating the plan, Li Lin guided everyone to tap the potential in agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry. He said that if there are difficulties, they can ask the government for loans to help solve them. In terms of agriculture, according to Li Shunda's experience of harvesting 963 jin of high-yield corn per mu last year, it was believed that as long as more fertilizer was applied and close planting was implemented, the yield could be greatly increased. If animal husbandry is developed, raising more sheep, pigs, horses, cattle, donkeys, and other livestock, increasing fertilizer would not be a problem. Using the surplus labor generated by the organization of the whole village to repair the滩 (tan), build dams, build reservoirs, dam mountain gullies, and repair terraced fields, and accumulating the tiny springs and rainwater, this can overcome the difficulties of insufficient water sources and land shortages in Xigou Village. Specific plans were also made for animal husbandry and afforestation. According to this plan, after three years, the total income of the whole village will increase from 925 shi and 4.8 dou of grain in 1951 to 2,175 shi and 3 dou.
    Less than half a year after the implementation of this plan, significant results have been achieved: In terms of agriculture, the average yield of autumn fields in the whole village reached 419 jin per mu, an increase of 49 jin compared to last year. In terms of forestry, the pine and cypress slope behind Shatuo has been pruned very neatly, and more than 1,000 various fruit trees grafted this year have survived. In terms of animal husbandry, the flock of sheep has increased from 185 to more than 600, and horses, cattle, donkeys, and mules have increased from 73 to 80. A newly added breeding donkey bred 25 heads in one summer. The number of pigs has increased from 12 to 25. In terms of basic land construction, 14 mu of river滩 land have been repaired, 12 mu of which can be planted with wheat this autumn. In addition, the mountain road from the school to the village has been widened, the foundations for concentrated relocation and housing construction in the whole village have been marked out, various materials for house repairs have been purchased, and a construction team specializing in house repairs has been formed, and construction will begin after the autumn harvest. This organized and planned basic construction has also solved the problem of the way out for the surplus labor originally generated by the organization. Now, every time something is done, it is felt that there is not enough manpower. In the past, many women wanted to participate in production but had no opportunity. This year, the work done by the women of Li Shunda's agricultural, forestry, and animal husbandry production cooperative has accounted for one-third of the total work of the cooperative. Now everyone is full of confidence in completing the three-year construction plan. (Zhao Xianbin)

    西沟村农民找到了山区生产发展的方向
    有些人谈到李顺达领导的山西省平顺县西沟村由穷变富的情形，都是万分敬佩；但是谈到将来，因为西沟村发展农业的自然条件不好，又不免为它的前途担忧。这种思想，在一九五一年春天，在西沟村的农民中间，也曾普遍发生过。怎样继续提高生产呢？西沟村的人力畜力绝大部分已经组织起来了；在耕作技术方面，政府号召的三耕、三锄、温汤浸种、药剂拌种都实行了，新式步犁也使用过了；拖拉机么？依照本村农民的说法，这里“连个机器腿也放不下”；想来想去，人们都说：“再增产也增不到什么地方去了。”
    没办法也得想办法，全村农民对继续发展生产，很费了一番心思。有些人有这种想法：要发展生产，只有搬到自然条件好的地方去。因此，在一九五一年春天，李顺达提出了一个轰动一时的“搬家计划”。那年十月，李顺达到北京参加国庆节观礼，见了毛主席。毛主席劝他不要搬家，并给他指出农业、林业、牧业结合发展的方针。李顺达的“搬家计划”，这时就完全打消了。西沟村农民明确了继续发展山区生产的正确方向，生产情绪就暂时稳定下来了。
    一九五一年秋后，大家分别买进八匹母马和四头母牛、母驴，又种了一部分树。但是，大家感觉这样的发展还是太慢。他们计算：一条母畜三年生两条驹，还比不上平原地区一亩丰产棉花一年的收入；林业的收入不知道要等多少年；而且现在又没有大量喂养牲畜、羊只的力量。这时村内又有桑运河、李德才、郭宝山等几户，想要搬家。
    今年春天，中央人民政府政务院发出了加强老根据地工作的指示，当时西沟村正有一部分人要搬家和出外谋生。中共平顺县委副书记李琳同志来到了西沟村，劝说五个出外谋生的农民，暂时不忙出去；他又集中力量，发动群众制订三年建设计划。
    订计划以前，中共西沟村支部、村人民政府发动全村党员、干部和群众学习了政务院加强老根据地工作的指示，看了苏联“红十月集体农场”的幻灯片子，又回忆了西沟村过去的贫困生活和今天的翻身情况，使大家建设山区的信心提高了。接着李琳同志亲自带领全村干部、党员和一部分群众，实际考察了西沟村所有的梯田、山沟、林坡和河滩。他们初步发现有三处地方可以修建小型水库，有一处地方可以打井，还有三处地方可以闸山沟，只要把这些能够办到的事情办到了，连人吃水都很困难的西沟村，就能有了水田。在视察林坡时，他们发现沙地?（西沟村一个自然庄）背后的松柏坡上，大的松树已有碗口粗了，小的也能做镢把，只要有计划地加以修剪和管理，林坡就会变成森林。西沟村很分散（全村有九个山庄），大部土地是梯田（全部土地约有两千多块），每个山庄的周围，每块梯田的两边，都长着各种果木树。宋金山十年前种的核桃树，现在每棵每年能产三斗至五斗核桃，李顺达三年前种的杏树，现在每年能卖两石多杏仁，今年春天接种的十几棵枣树，当年就结了红枣。这些活生生的事实，说明了西沟村有发展林木和果园的充分条件。视察河滩和荒坡时，他们发现村口有大片河滩，可以修成河滩地，有大片荒坡可以造林和放牧。这也说明西沟村有巨大的发展生产的潜在力。订计划的时候，李琳引导大家在农业、林业、牧畜业三方面发掘潜在能力，他说，如有困难，可请示政府贷款帮助解决。在农业方面，大家根据李顺达去年每亩丰产玉茭收获九百六十三斤的经验，认为只要多施肥，实行密植，还可大大提高产量。如果发展了牧畜业，多养羊，多养猪，多养马、牛、驴等牲畜，增加肥料就不成问题。利用全村因组织起来所产生的剩余劳力，修滩、打坝、修水库、闸山沟、修梯田，把微小的泉水和雨水都积蓄起来，这就可以克服西沟村水源不足和土地缺少的困难。在牧畜和造林方面，也作了具体计划。按照这一计划去执行，三年后全村的总收入将由一九五一年的九百二十五石四斗八升粮食，提高到两千一百七十五石三斗。
    这个计划执行了不到半年已经有了显著的成绩：在农业方面，全村秋田每亩平均产量达到了四百一十九斤，比去年增加了四十九斤。在林业方面，沙地?背后的松柏坡已修剪得很整齐了，今年新接种的各种果树，已成活了一千多棵。在畜牧方面，羊群已由一百八十五只增加到六百多只，马、牛、驴、骡已由七十三头增加到八十头，新增加的一条种驴，一夏天就配种了二十五头。猪已由十二口增加到二十五口。在土地基本建设方面，已修了十四亩河滩地，其中有十二亩今秋就可种麦子。另外，从学校通往村里的山路已经修宽，全村准备集中移住兴建房屋的地基已经划好，修房用的各种器材也已买妥，专门修房的修建队已经组成，秋收后就开始动工。这样有组织有计划地进行基本建设，把原来由于组织起来而产生的剩余劳力的出路问题也解决了。现在每做一件事都感到人力不够用。过去许多妇女想参加生产也没有机会，今年李顺达农林畜牧生产合作社的妇女所做的工，已占全社总工数的三分之一。现在每个人对完成三年建设计划，都充满了信心。（赵宪斌）
