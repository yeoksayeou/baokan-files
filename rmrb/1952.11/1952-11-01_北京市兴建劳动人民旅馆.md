    Beijing to Build Laboring People's Hotels
    To the Editor: In order to facilitate the accommodation of laboring people from small towns and rural areas who come to the city to sell local products and purchase industrial goods in the process of promoting the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas, the Beijing Municipal People's Government has specially commissioned the Real Estate Administration Bureau to build laboring people's hotels in batches. The first batch, with a total of 274 rooms, was built in Lepaiyuan inside Guang'anmen and Mileyuan outside Chaoyangmen, which can accommodate nearly 1,000 guests, 40 large carts, and 50 horses. The Mileyuan Laboring People's Hotel outside Chaoyangmen has already started operating and is very popular among the laboring people of Tongxian, Sanhe, Jixian, Shunyi, Xinglong and other counties, and along the Jinggu Railway line. The second batch of laboring people's hotel projects started in full swing in early September, with 302 rooms to be built at the small railway station outside Yongdingmen, 508 rooms to be built in the western section of the Guanxiang Railway outside Guang'anmen, 310 rooms to be built on the Beishang Slope of Dashikou outside Deshengmen Guanxiang, and 404 rooms to be built at Shegutang outside Chaoyangmen Guanxiang. A total of 1,524 rooms will be built in four locations, accommodating 3,000 people, 170 vehicles, and 300 horses. Nearly a thousand workers are now working intensely. The structure of these hotels is relatively simple and popular, quite sturdy and durable, and most suitable for the laboring people to use. The houses are generally bungalows, and most of them are north-facing, with plenty of sunlight, and are equipped with canteens, entertainment venues, and small gardens. In addition, there are also large cart rooms, troughs and other equipment. Generally better than cart and horse inns.

    北京市兴建劳动人民旅馆
    编辑同志：北京市人民政府为了在促进城乡物资交流的过程中，使小城镇和农村劳动人民进城推销土产品和购买工业品住宿方便，特由房地产管理局分批兴建劳动人民旅馆。第一批分别在广安门内的乐培园和朝阳门外的弥勒院共盖旅馆二百七十四间，能容纳客人近千人，大车四十多辆，马五十多匹。朝阳门外弥勒院劳动人民旅馆已经开始营业，很受通县、三河、蓟县、顺义、兴隆等县和京古铁路沿线劳动人民欢迎。第二批劳动人民旅馆工程在九月初旬全面开工，在永定门外小火车站建房三百零二间，广安门外关厢铁路西段建房五百零八间，德胜门外关厢大市口北上坡建房三百一十间，朝阳门外关厢赦孤堂建房四百零四间，四处建房共计一千五百二十四间，能容纳三千人，车辆一百七十辆，马三百匹。现在有近千工人正在紧张工作中。这些旅馆的房屋结构较为简朴、大众化，颇坚固耐久，劳动人民住用最为适宜。房屋一般都是平房，且大部为北房，阳光充裕，并设有食堂、娱乐场所、小庭园等。此外，还有大车房、槽等设备。一般比车马店好。    阎世增
