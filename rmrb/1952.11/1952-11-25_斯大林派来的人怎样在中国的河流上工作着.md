How People Sent by Stalin Work on China's Rivers
Deputy Minister of Water Resources, Central People's Government Zhang Hanying

The achievements of China's water conservancy construction in the past three years are inseparable from the help of the Soviet Union.

The great Soviet water conservancy construction indicates a bright future for us. The application of advanced Soviet science and technology has enabled us to build many proud and great water conservancy projects in a short period. The experts sent by Stalin, with their socialist demeanor and rich experience, directly helped China's water conservancy construction and technical improvement.

First of all, in terms of the idea of water management, the Central People's Government proposed the principle of turning water hazards into water benefits when it was established, but we lacked systematic knowledge and experience in this regard, and there was no clear understanding of how to realize this principle. Especially after the nationwide severe floods in 1949 and the Huai River floods in 1950, the general idea was always a fear of water. At this time, Soviet experts repeatedly explained to us that water is the wealth of the people, and to comprehensively and fundamentally control water, it is necessary to block and control the water so that it can be managed by people. Because when there is a lot of rain in summer and autumn, you may feel that there is a lot of water, but when there is a drought in spring, you may feel that there is a lack of water; floods often occur downstream, while droughts often occur upstream. Although the water is high this year, the amount of water may not be enough in ordinary years. Therefore, to manage each river, we must first calculate the total account of the entire basin over many years before we can decide how to treat the water. In the treatment process, we must also combine the needs of flood control, irrigation, navigation, and power generation to achieve the most economical treatment. In order to specifically explain this problem, Soviet experts also systematically introduced Stalin's plan to transform nature to us. In terms of water conservancy alone, they will build a large number of reservoirs and storage ponds. They will not only develop large-scale irrigation systems, but also increase the humidity in the air to change the agricultural climate. The idea emphasized by Soviet experts has had a great impact on our entire water conservancy plan.

The first project in China to realize this idea of water management was the Huai River project initiated by Chairman Mao. In the Huai River project, thanks to the technical assistance of Soviet experts, we powerfully realized Chairman Mao's call, not only to permanently eliminate water disasters in the 220,000 square kilometers of land in the Huai River basin, but also to develop 50 million mu of farmland irrigation, improve the 2,000-kilometer navigation system, and build a number of hydroelectric power generation projects. According to rough calculations based on historical data, water disasters in the Huai River basin directly damage agricultural production, resulting in an average annual loss of 600 million jin of grain; if the Huai River project adopts a simple flood discharge measure, its average annual benefit would only increase grain production by 600 million jin. Now, after accepting the advanced Soviet experience in water management, in terms of irrigation benefits alone, if dry land is converted into paddy fields, the average yield per mu will increase by 80 jin, which can increase grain production by 4 billion jin per year.

This practical and huge benefit is incredibly convincing. The effectiveness of the Huai River project has made China's water conservancy construction change from fearing water to loving water since 1951; from passively defending against floods to actively controlling and utilizing floods; from local management to basin planning. Seizing all usable water sources from nature to serve the people is our current slogan. Under this direction, we have seen our rich resources, broad prospects, and the infinite possibilities for the development of water conservancy.

Our water conservancy technicians, because most of them came from the old society, more or less have the ideological viewpoints of being divorced from politics and the practical viewpoints of being divorced from reality. Water conservancy projects in capitalist countries are to obtain greater profits for the exploiting classes. In order to deceive the people and cover up their exploiting nature, they say that technical work is above classes and that technicians should not ask about politics. In the past, under the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries in China, there were few water conservancy projects, which made many technicians unable to use what they had learned. These historical characteristics have caused most of our old technicians to lack contact with the working people in terms of ideological feelings. Therefore, in the early days of liberation, the viewpoint of serving the people was not clear enough. In terms of technical work alone, it was also limited to book knowledge and lacked practical experience. They were indecisive on many important technical issues, and the design of the project could not be combined with the actual situation to exert the creativity of the work.

The work attitude and technical cultivation of Soviet experts have given us great help in this regard. The Runheji diversion gate of the Huai River project is a key to controlling the floods of the Huai River; if it can be completed before the flood season in 1951, it will play a great role in reducing water disasters in northern Anhui and northern Jiangsu in that year. However, at that time, our technicians were not sure about this technically difficult project and believed that only a temporary project could be built. The Jingjiang flood diversion project is related to the major interests of the people in Hubei and Hunan provinces. Completing it one year earlier will ensure the safety of millions of people one year earlier. However, we initially believed that we could only do a temporary project first, or build the inlet gate first and postpone the control gate until after the flood season. On these major issues, it was due to the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the technical assistance of Soviet experts that the hesitation in everyone's minds was overcome and the project was launched. The technical key to the completion of these huge sluice gates in a short period of time was that the advanced Soviet method of gate construction was basically used to replace 10,000 to 20,000 foundation piles and 10,000 to 20,000 square meters of sheet piles. Our technicians did not completely know the basic principle of not driving foundation piles and sheet piles, but they lacked confidence due to lack of experience; more importantly, they did not fully appreciate the urgent needs of the people, and therefore could not study and create methods to overcome difficulties.

After China's direction of water management turned to controlling water flow and utilizing water flow, the construction of reservoirs and dams developed rapidly throughout the country. Soviet experts have provided countless technical assistance to these projects. For example, using soil to build high dams is the result of the highly developed Soviet soil science. Because China has widely adopted this method, it has solved the difficulties in foundation treatment of some reservoir projects, and has also made it possible to obtain materials locally, saving the country a lot of steel and cement. The new method of sluice gate design and foundation treatment mentioned earlier, as well as new and effective methods for reducing hydraulic power and preventing scouring, have been widely welcomed in China. However, the most important help that Soviet experts have given us is not only these specific technical teachings, but more importantly, the spirit of Soviet experts who combine theory with practice, compare various aspects, study and create, and help our technical personnel to be liberated in technical thinking, so that the management plans of many rivers can be liberated from the ideas of imperialism and the reactionary ruling class, and new plans can be created according to the needs of the people. The design of many projects has broken away from the constraints of traditional specifications and created new designs based on technical principles and engineering needs. The construction of many projects has broken the old technical quotas and engineering progress and created amazing new records. For example, in the design of a reservoir, the calculation of the maximum flow of the spillway is based on the design flood plus one time. Soviet experts asked why this was calculated, and no one could give a reason, only saying that this is how it has always been calculated. In fact, this is a wrong idea that only cares about safety and does not talk about economy. For example, for the selection of reservoir sites, we have always chosen the "big belly and small mouth" terrain, believing that building a dam on a narrow mouth is the most economical design. However, the most economical calculation is multi-faceted. Such as the amount of construction costs, the difficulty of construction, the size of the submerged losses, the geological conditions of the dam site, the size of the project benefits, etc., must be comprehensively calculated. As long as the benefits are great and the construction of the project is permitted by technical conditions, a long dam can also be used. These examples seem to be very common sense, but it is not easy to break free from these traditional and unconscious shackles; and breaking free will make a great contribution. The Chaobai River Reservoir and the Yellow River Reservoir, which are being planned, have overturned historical traditional opinions—including the opinions of experts from imperialist countries—due to this ideological liberation, and proposed better methods.

Advanced Soviet experience has also greatly promoted the development of irrigation in China. In the past, China generally believed that a flow of 1 cubic meter per second could irrigate up to 20,000 mu of farmland, but according to Soviet experts, it could irrigate more than 60,000 mu. At first, we thought that such a standard was unbelievable, but the practice of the masses quickly negated this conservative idea. Some areas have implemented shallow irrigation, furrow irrigation, and organized "contracted irrigation" methods, which have broken the outdated standard of 20,000 mu and reached a high amount of 30,000 mu, and individual channels have even reached more than 30,000 mu. Facts have made us believe that it is entirely possible to absorb advanced Soviet experience to increase China's irrigated area by one or two times in the short term on the basis of existing equipment.

Another important influence that Soviet experts have given us is the spirit of collectivism and internationalism in work. For an intellectual from the old society, the remaining influence of individualism is sometimes even unconscious, but it has a serious adverse effect on work. For example, a strong awareness of demanding to maintain one's own authority in knowledge or technology will prevent several experts from cooperating sincerely, not believing in the masses, not believing in collective wisdom, will hinder the development of discussions, and make technical work impossible to achieve perfection. The petty calculation of some personal interests will lead to scruples, suspicions, and unprincipled sectarian disputes. Such complex and backward ideological emotions cannot be seen even a little bit in Soviet experts. They have never cared about personal gains or losses, but they will never fail. Their main working methods are field observation, experimentation, and mobilizing everyone to discuss together. They want to do the project well, so they hope that everyone can master the best technology and knowledge. They respect China's technical experts very much, but they must have heated debates on different opinions; similarly, they are also very unwilling for China's experts to have different opinions from them and make pretentious reservations. Before they make a suggestion, they must conduct detailed discussions on various situations with China's engineering personnel. When they provide a new technical opinion, they often let the Chinese technicians who work with them make reports. When they see our comrades skillfully mastering new theories and explaining in detail the structure of a new type of complex building, their eyes flash with a different kind of light. That kind of uncontrollable joyful mood is very moving.

Soviet experts love China as much as they love the Soviet Union. They love our youth and children, love our workers and farmers, and love our rivers and land. Soviet expert Bukov suffered from a serious eye disease for a period of time, but he still insisted on working on the Huai River. When they accompanied Minister Fu Zuoyi, Deputy Minister Li Baohua of the Ministry of Water Resources of the Central People's Government, and me to survey the Yellow River, the Huai River, and the Yangtze River, they were happy even after an extremely difficult journey in remote mountains. They have already enjoyed extremely high prestige among the Chinese people. Whenever they arrive at the construction site, the news immediately spreads among thousands of workers and farmers, saying "People sent by Stalin." This shows that these experts are sincere, capable, close, and trustworthy!

    斯大林派来的人怎样在中国的河流上工作着
    中央人民政府水利部副部长  张含英
    三年来我国水利建设的成就，是和苏联的帮助分不开的。
    苏联伟大的水利建设，给我们指示着光辉的前景。苏联先进科学和技术的应用，已经使我们在短期内建造起许多值得骄傲的伟大水利工程。斯大林派来的专家们，以社会主义的风范和丰富的经验，直接地帮助了我国水利建设和技术的提高。
    首先就治水的思想来说，中央人民政府成立的时候，就提出了变水害为水利的方针，但是我们在这一方面缺乏系统的知识和经验，怎样实现这个方针，却没有明确的认识。特别是在一九四九年全国性的严重水灾和一九五零年淮河水灾以后，一般的思想总是对水存着畏惧的心理。这时苏联专家便反复地向我们解释：水是人民的财富，要全面地根本地治水，必须把水拦蓄控制起来，听人的支配。因为在夏秋多雨的时候，虽然感觉水多，可是春季干旱的时候，也许感觉缺水；下游经常发生水灾，而上游时常干旱。今年虽然水大，普通年份水量也许不够。所以要治理每一条河流，必须首先就全流域多少年的情况算一算总账，才能决定水的处理。在处理当中，又必须结合防洪、灌溉、航运、发电等多方面的需要，才能做到最经济的处理。为了具体地说明这个问题，苏联专家们并且向我们系统地介绍了斯大林改造自然的计划，单是水利方面，他们就要建造大量的蓄水库、蓄水池，他们不但要发展大规模的灌溉系统，同时还要增加空气中的湿度，以改变农业气候。苏联专家所强调的这一思想，对我们全部水利的计划，已经起了极大的影响。
    在我国第一个实现了这种治水思想的工程，是毛主席所倡导的治淮工程。治淮工程里，由于苏联专家的技术协助，使我们有力地实现了毛主席的号召，不但要使淮河流域的二十二万平方公里的土地永绝水患，同时还要发展五千万亩的农田灌溉，改善二千公里的航道系统，并建造若干水力发电工程。根据历史资料的粗略的计算，淮河流域的水灾，对农业生产的直接损害，平均每年损失粮食六亿斤；假如治淮工程采取单纯排洪的措施，其每年平均的效益不过增产粮食六亿斤。现在接受了苏联先进的治水经验，单就灌溉效益来说，旱地改为水地后，平均每亩增产粮食八十斤计算，每年即可增产粮食四十亿斤。
    这种实际巨大的利益，是具有无比说服力的。治淮工程实践的成效，使我国水利建设从一九五一年起，从怕水变成爱水；从被动的防御洪水，变成主动地控制和利用洪水；从局部的治理，变为流域的规划。向大自然夺取一切可以利用的水源，以为人民服务，是我们当前的口号。在这个方向下，我们才看见了自己的丰富的资源，广阔的前途和水利事业发展的无限的可能性。
    我们的水利技术人员，因为大部分人是从旧社会过来的，所以或多或少带有思想上脱离政治的观点和技术上脱离实际的观点。资本主义国家的水利工程，是为了剥削阶级获得更大的利润，为了欺骗人民，掩饰他们剥削的本质，他们说技术工作是超阶级的，技术人员应该不问政治。在过去国民党反动派统治的中国，很少举办水利工程，又使许多技术人员学无所用。这些历史的特点，使我们旧有的技术人员多数和劳动人民在思想感情上缺少联系。因此，在解放初期，为人民服务的观点是不够明确的。单就技术工作来说，也是局限于书本知识，缺乏实践经验；在许多重要的技术问题上举棋不定，在工程的设计上不能结合实际情况，以发挥工作的创造性。
    苏联专家的工作态度和技术修养，在这方面给了我们极大的帮助。治淮工程的润河集分水闸，是控制淮河洪水的一个关键；假如它能在一九五一年汛前完成，对于皖北、苏北当年减轻水患就能发生很大的作用。可是当时我们的技术人员，因为对于这种技术性较高的工程还没有把握，认为只能修筑一个临时性的工程。荆江分洪工程关系着湖北、湖南两省人民重大的利益，早完成一年，就会使数百万人的安全早一年获得保障。可是我们最初也认为只能先做临时性的工程，或者先做进洪闸，把节制闸推迟到汛后举办。在这些重大的问题上，都是由于中国共产党的领导和苏联专家在技术上的帮助，克服了大家思想上的犹豫，工程才举办起来。这几个巨大的水闸所以能在短期间完成，其技术上的关键问题，都是基本上用苏联先进的建闸的方法代替了一两万根基桩和一两万平方公尺的板桩而得到解决的。不打基桩和板桩的基本原理，我们的技术人员不是完全不知道，是由于缺乏经验因而缺乏信心；更主要的，还是由于对人民的迫切需要体会不足，因而不能钻研创造克服困难的方法。
    我国治水的方向转向于控制水流和利用水流以后，水库和闸坝的修筑就在全国大量发展起来。这些工程，苏联专家在技术上的帮助是数不清的。比如用土来修筑高坝，是苏联土壤科学高度发展的结果。由于我国大量采用了这种办法，解决了有些水库工程基础处理的困难，并且作到了就地取材，为国家节省了大量的钢筋、水泥。前面所说的水闸设计和基础处理的新方法，以及关于消减水力、防止冲刷等等新的有效办法，在我国都已受到普遍的欢迎。但是苏联专家对我们最重要的帮助，还不只是这些具体的技术的传授，更重要的，是苏联专家联系实际、多方比较、钻研创造的精神，帮助我们的技术人员在技术思想上得到了解放，使许多河流的治理计划，从帝国主义和反动统治阶级的思想下解放出来，根据人民的需要创造了新的计划。许多工程的设计，摆脱了传统的规格的束缚，根据技术原则和工程需要，创造了新的设计。许多工程的施工，打破了旧有的技术定额和工程进度，创造了惊人的新纪录。比如有一个水库的设计，溢洪道最大流量的计算是根据设计洪水加一倍计算，苏联专家问为什么这样计算，谁也说不出理由，只是说历来都是这样算的。其实，这是一种只顾安全不讲经济的错误思想。又比如对于水库地址的选择，我们一向是选择“大肚子小口”的地形，认为只有在狭口上筑坝，才是最经济的设计。但最经济的计算，是多方面的。如工费多少，施工难易，淹没损失的大小，坝址的地质条件，工程的效益大小等，都要做综合的核算才行。只要效益很大，工程的修建又为技术条件所许可，长坝是一样可以采用的。这些例证彷佛是很普通的常识，但是从这些传统的不自觉的桎梏下挣脱出来，也并不容易；而挣脱出来，就会有很大的贡献。正在计划中的潮白河水库和黄河水库，都是由于这种思想的解放，推翻了历史上的传统意见——包括帝国主义国家专家的意见，提出了更好的办法。
    苏联先进经验对我国灌溉事业的发展也起了巨大的推动作用。我国过去的传统，一般认为每秒立方公尺的水流最多能灌溉两万亩农田，可是根据苏联专家的意见，却可以灌溉到六万亩以上。最初我们认为这样的标准是难以相信的，可是群众的实践很快地否定了这种保守思想。有的地区实行浅灌、畦灌和组织“包浇”的办法，已经打破了两万亩陈腐的标准，达到三万亩的高额，个别的渠道并且达到三万亩以上。事实使我们相信，吸收苏联先进经验，使我国的灌溉面积在现有设备的基础上短期内提高一两倍，是完全可能的。
    苏联专家所给我们的另一重要影响是工作中的集体主义和国际主义的精神。对于一个从旧社会出身的知识分子，个人主义的残余影响，有时甚至是不自觉的，然而它对于工作，却起着严重的不良影响。比如在知识或技术上要求保持自己的某种权威的强烈的意识，就会使几个专家不能推诚合作，不相信群众，不相信集体的智慧，就会妨害讨论的展开，使技术工作不能达到完善的境地。某种个人利害的斤斤计较，就会产生顾忌、猜疑和无原则的宗派纠纷。像这一类复杂的落后的思想情绪，在苏联专家身上是连一点影子也看不见的。他们永远没有计较过个人的得失，然而他们永远不会失败。他们工作的主要方法是实地观察、试验和发动大家共同讨论。他们是为了把工程做好，因而他们希望每一个人能掌握最好的技术和知识。他们非常尊重我国的技术专家，然而对不同的意见，却一定进行热烈的争论；同样的，他们也极不愿意我国的专家对他们有不同意见而做矜持的保留。在他们提出建议以前，一定要和我国的工程人员对各种情况进行详尽的讨论。在提供一个新的技术意见的时候，他们常常让和他们一同工作的我国技术人员做报告，看着我们的同志纯熟地掌握了新的学理，详明地解释着一个新型的复杂的建筑物的结构时，他们的眼睛就闪出了异样的光辉，那种抑制不住的愉快的心情，十分令人感动。
    苏联专家爱我国正如爱苏联，他们爱我们的青年、儿童，爱我们的工人、农民，爱我们的河流和土地。苏联专家布可夫有一个时期患着严重的眼病，但还在淮河上坚持工作。他们在陪同中央人民政府水利部傅作义部长、李葆华副部长和我在黄河、淮河和长江查勘的时候，在荒山僻壤，经过异常艰苦的旅程而甘之如饴。他们在我国人民群众中已经享有了极高的威望，每当他们到达工地的时候，消息立刻就在千万个工人、农民当中传开了“斯大林派来的人”的说法。这说明这些专家是真诚、能干、亲近而可以信赖的！
