    Central People's Government Industrial and Transportation Departments Concentrate Cadres to Strengthen Basic Construction

    [This newspaper report] In order to meet the task of large-scale economic construction across the country and prepare for basic construction next year, the industrial and transportation departments of the Central People's Government are currently making great efforts to concentrate cadres, strengthen basic construction institutions, and carry out other work.
    The basic construction tasks of various departments next year will be more complex and arduous than in any previous year, while the strength of basic construction is very weak. Therefore, various departments are stepping up effective measures, planning to complete the concentration of cadres and strengthen basic construction organizations this winter and next spring, making them the strongest institutions. At the same time, they must prepare for next year's design and construction work. So far, the work has progressed faster in the Ministry of Heavy Industry, the Ministry of Railways, the Ministry of Fuel Industry, and the Ministry of Geology.
    Following the Basic Construction Conference of the Financial and Economic Committee of the State Council of the Central People's Government, the Ministry of Heavy Industry convened a meeting of bureau directors of specialized bureaus. At the meeting, the instructions of Chen Yun, Director of the Financial and Economic Committee of the State Council, were conveyed, and the investment policy for next year was discussed, determining the control figures for each project. The ministry convened a national conference of key factories and mines on the 17th of this month to specifically implement the instructions of the Financial and Economic Committee of the State Council and establish the concept of giving priority to basic construction from top to bottom.
    The basic construction institutions at the ministry level of the Ministry of Heavy Industry are the most substantial. For example, the main leading cadres of the Design Department and the Basic Construction Department have been equipped. Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members account for more than half of the total number of people in these two departments. Design forces have been basically organized. In addition, each specialized bureau has design institutions. In terms of construction forces, there are already eleven specialized engineering companies in the Northeast, and preparations are being made to establish thirteen engineering companies within the customs. Currently, cadres and technical personnel are being transferred from the production departments. In order to strengthen resource exploration, the ministry is actively training drilling personnel, ordering drilling equipment, and preparing to vigorously carry out exploration work.
    The Ministry of Railways reorganized its basic construction institutions in September of this year, expanding the original Design Bureau and Engineering Bureau, and newly established a Basic Construction Bureau. The Design Bureau has successively established eighteen survey and design teams, establishing design sub-bureaus in the Northeast, Central South, Northwest, and Southwest. The existing strength of the Design Bureau can complete the survey and design tasks of 1,500 to 2,000 kilometers of new lines each year. In October, the Ministry of Railways convened a basic construction conference to deploy the task of building more than 800 kilometers of new lines next year. Among them, the technical design of the Lanzhou-Xinjiang section has been partially completed, and it can be fully completed by the end of this year. The technical design of the southern section of the Tianshui-Chengdu Railway has also been partially completed.
    The Ministry of Fuel Industry successively convened the first National Electric Power Basic Construction Conference and the National Coal Mine Basic Construction and Planning Conference in October to discuss basic construction issues for next year. The ministry has established a Coal Industry Design Bureau and an Electric Power Design Bureau, and is preparing to transfer hundreds of design cadres from the coal industry production departments to strengthen the coal industry design institutions and concentrate and train more than 2,000 drilling technical cadres by the end of this year; and to transfer hundreds of design cadres from the electric power production departments to strengthen the electric power design institutions. In addition, in order to strengthen leadership, the ministry reorganized the General Administration of Coal and Electricity, establishing a basic construction construction institution within the General Administration.
    The Ministry of Geology was formally established on September 1 this year. After its establishment, the ministry strengthened its internal institutions and prepared to establish geological bureaus in major administrative regions. The Central South and Southwest Geological Bureaus have been established. The ministry will convene a national geological planning conference to determine the focus of geological work next year.
    However, the work of some departments has progressed relatively slowly. Although the leading cadres of these departments realize that basic construction work must be given priority, they weakened their determination to transfer cadres and strengthen basic construction forces when they heard difficulties from below. For example, some departments have not yet concentrated their cadres, and institutions such as the Basic Construction Department and the Design Department have just been established, and their strength is still very weak. Therefore, the preparatory work for some projects that will be constructed next year has no clues. Some departments have not yet established basic construction institutions. Currently, there is only a basic construction section, and the design institution is only a group belonging to the basic construction section, with weak strength. These departments must immediately make up their minds to transfer and concentrate cadres, quickly establish and strengthen basic construction institutions, and strengthen basic construction leadership. Otherwise, it will be difficult to complete the complex and arduous basic construction tasks next year.

### 中央人民政府工业与交通各部门集中干部加强基本建设

    中央人民政府工业与交通各部门集中干部加强基本建设
    【本报讯】中央人民政府工业与交通各部门为迎接全国大规模经济建设的任务，做好明年基本建设准备工作，目前正大力集中干部，充实基本建设机构，并进行其它工作。
    各部门明年基本建设任务较以往任何一年都要复杂、繁重，而基本建设力量则十分薄弱。因此，各部门正在加紧采取有效的措施，计划在今冬明春完成集中干部，加强基本建设组织机构，使它成为最强的机构；同时要做好明年的设计和施工的准备工作。到现在为止，工作进行得较快的有：重工业部、铁道部、燃料工业部、地质部等。
    重工业部继中央人民政府政务院财政经济委员会基本建设会议之后，召开了专业局局长会议。会上，传达了政务院财政经济委员会陈云主任的指示，并讨论了明年的投资方针，确定了每项工程的控制数字。该部于本月十七日召开全国重点厂矿会议，以便具体贯彻政务院财政经济委员会的指示，从上到下树立将基本建设放在首要地位的观念。
    重工业部部一级的基本建设机构最为充实。如设计司、基本建设司的主要领导干部已配备起来。这两个司的中共党员与青年团员共占全体人数的一半以上。设计力量已基本上组织起来，另外，各专业局都有设计机构。施工力量，在东北已有十一个专业工程公司，并准备在关内成立十三个工程公司，目前正在从生产部门抽调干部和技术人员。为了加强资源的勘察，该部正积极训练钻探人员，订购钻探器材，准备大力进行勘察工作。
    铁道部在今年九月重新整顿了基本建设机构，把原有的设计局和工程总局扩大，并新成立了基本建设局。设计局已先后成立十八个勘察设计总队，在东北、中南、西北、西南成立设计分局。设计局的现有力量，每年可以完成一千五百到二千公里的新线的勘察和设计任务。十月，铁道部召开了基本建设会议，布置明年新修八百多公里线路的任务。其中兰（州）新（疆）段的技术设计已完成一部分，今年年底可以全部完成；天（水）成（都）路南段的技术设计亦已完成了一部。
    燃料工业部于十月间先后召开了第一次全国电业基本建设会议和全国煤矿基本建设及计划会议，讨论了明年的基本建设问题。该部已成立煤业设计局和电业设计局，并准备在今年年底从煤业生产部门抽调几百个设计干部充实煤业设计机构，集中和训练两千多个钻探技术干部；从电业生产部门抽调几百个设计干部充实电业设计机构。此外，为了加强领导，该部又改组了煤和电的管理总局，在管理总局里成立基本建设施工机构。
    地质部是今年九月一日正式成立的。该部成立以后，充实了部内的各个机构，同时筹备成立各大行政区的地质局，现已成立的有中南、西南两地质局。该部将召开全国地质计划会议，确定明年地质工作的重点。
    但有一些部门的工作进行得比较缓慢。这些部的领导干部虽然认识了必须把基本建设工作放在首要地位，但听到下面叫喊困难，就减弱了抽调干部加强基本建设力量的决心。如有的部干部还没有集中起来，基本建设司、设计司等机构刚成立，力量还很薄弱，因而有些将于明年施工的工程，准备工作还没有头绪。有的部基本建设机构还没有建立起来，目前只有一个基本建设处，设计机构只是属于基本建设处的一个组，力量薄弱。这些部门，必须立即下决心抽调和集中干部，迅速建立和充实基本建设机构，加强基本建设领导，否则，明年如此复杂、繁重的基本建设任务是很难完成的。
