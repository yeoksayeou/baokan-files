    Spreading New Farm Tools Requires Good Technical Instruction
    Editor: In the Zhaizhang and Qingshui areas of the Beijing Western Mining District, farmers were loaned ten new walking plows this spring, but because they didn't know how to use them, most of these plows were left idle. This is a significant obstacle to the work of promoting new farm tools. In light of this situation, the Beijing Western Mining District People's Government convened a symposium on October 8th in Zhaizhang District to discuss the promotion of new farm tools and impart the techniques for using them. All thirty farmers who attended the meeting learned how to use, assemble, and disassemble the walking plows. Farmer Li Shiyuan, who attended the meeting, said, "If I had known how to use them like this, I would have used them long ago." Thanks to the imparted techniques, thirty new walking plows were quickly promoted in these two districts. Farmers who personally used the new plows immediately recognized that the new plows were more effective than the old plows. Some people reported that the Du Fuzhen mutual aid team in Dujiazhuang Village plowed four and a half mu of land per day with a new plow pulled by two small donkeys, and the plowing was deep and thorough; while plowing with an old plow pulled by two large oxen only plowed three mu of land per day, and the quality was very poor. The above facts illustrate the importance of imparting techniques in the work of promoting new farm tools. Tan Jian

    推广新式农具应该作好技术传授工作
    编辑同志：北京市京西矿区斋堂、清水两区的农民，今春贷到十张新式步犁，因为不会使用，这些步犁大部分闲置起来了。这是推广新式农具工作的很大的障碍。京西矿区人民政府根据这种情况，于十月八日在斋堂区召集了研究推广新式农具的座谈会，传授使用新式农具的技术。参加会议的三十位农民都学会了使用和拆装步犁的方法。参加会议的农民李世元说：“我要知道是这样用法，早就用啦。”由于传授了技术，这两区迅速推广了三十张新式步犁。农民亲自使用了新式犁，立即认识到新犁比旧犁的效用大。有的群众反映：杜家庄村杜甫珍互助组，用两头小毛驴拉新犁耕地，每天耕四亩半地，耕的又深又透；用两条大牛拉旧犁耕地，一天只耕三亩地，而且质量很差。上述事实，说明了在推广新农具工作中传授技术的重要性。谭俭
