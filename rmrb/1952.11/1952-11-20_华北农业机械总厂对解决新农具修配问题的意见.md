    Opinions of the North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory on Solving the Problem of Repairing and Supplying New Agricultural Implements

    Comrade Editor: The demands of farmers in Hebei Province and Lucheng County, Shanxi, for solving the problem of repairing and supplying new agricultural implements are completely justified. Based on the situation reflected in the above two locations, we believe this problem should be solved in three aspects:

    First, after each new type of agricultural implement is successfully designed, we should study and determine which accessories should be included. We used to do this, such as each walking plow was shipped with two extra plowshares and a wrench. However, sometimes because of insufficient prior consideration and the failure to remedy the situation well afterward, the use of agricultural implements was seriously affected. For example, each small chaff cutter should be equipped with a large and a small wrench, but we simply thought that the large wrench of the small chaff cutter could be borrowed from the walking plow, so we rashly decided not to include them separately; this made it impossible for people who bought only the chaff cutter without buying the walking plow to use it. In response to this, this year we have begun to reissue or exchange them for farmers who have purchased small chaff cutters. In addition, before the "Three-Anti" movement, our factory's system was not sound enough, and supervision and inspection in production were not strict enough. A small number of agricultural implements' accessories or parts were not manufactured and distributed to farmers in a timely manner. We should deeply examine these issues and resolutely prevent them in future work.

    Secondly, the technology of using new agricultural implements should arouse widespread attention from relevant leading authorities in various regions. In the promotion of new agricultural implements, many problems have occurred because the technology has not kept up. For example, Comrade Zhu Zhiru of the Hebei Provincial Agricultural Supply Cooperative wrote in a letter, "The moving blade originally installed on the chaff cutter became blunt after cutting more than 1,000 catties of grass; but without a spare moving blade, it cannot be replaced." In fact, the blade will become blunt after cutting about 1,000 catties of grass, and it only needs to be sharpened, and there is no need to replace it with a new one. Failure to pay attention to technical instruction sometimes leads to the disastrous consequences of damaging the machine parts. For example, the blade of the chaff cutter should be sharpened on the inside, but some farmers sharpened the outside, and the result was that the more they sharpened it, the worse it became. In the future, as we gradually promote larger and more complex agricultural implements, the issue of imparting technology will become increasingly important. Therefore, we suggest that relevant authorities in various regions pay attention to this issue.

    In 1950, due to material reasons, a small number of the blades of the small chaff cutters we manufactured did not have sufficient hardness. Some of these blades have already been recalled and processed by us to meet the specifications; if any are found in various regions, they can also be returned to our factory for processing and transformation.

    Thirdly, the Central Ministry of Agriculture's symposium on the promotion of new agricultural implements has made specific decisions on the issue of repairing and supplying damaged parts.

    华北农业机械总厂对解决新农具修配问题的意见
    编辑同志：河北省和山西潞城县农民对解决新式农具修配问题的要求是完全正当的。根据上述两地反映的情况，我们认为这个问题应分三方面来解决：
    首先应该在每种新式农具设计成功后，研究确定应带那些附件。过去我们是这样做的，如各种步犁出厂时每部都额外附带两个犁铧、一把扳手。但有时因为事先考虑不周，事后又未很好补救，以致严重地影响了农具的使用。如小铡草机每部应该附带大小扳手各一把，而我们只想到小铡草机的大扳手可以借用步犁的扳手，就草率决定不另附带；这就使没买步犁而单买了铡草机的人没法使用了。对此，今年我们已开始为购买了小铡草机的农民补发或调换。此外，在“三反”运动以前，我厂制度不甚健全，生产上监督检查不够严密，曾有少数农具的附件或零件没有及时制出发给农民。这些，我们应该深刻检讨并在今后工作中坚决防止。
    其次，新式农具的使用技术，应该引起各地有关领导机关普遍的注意。在新式农具推广中，有许多问题是因为技术没有跟上而发生的。如河北省农业供应社朱志儒同志来信中说到，“铡草机上原安的动刀片铡了一千多斤草，就不快了；但没有多余的动刀片就不能换。”事实上刀片铡一千斤左右的草后是会不快的，只要磨一磨就行了，不必另换新的。不注意技术传授，有时还造成弄坏机件的恶果。如铡草机刀片应该磨里口，有的农民却磨了外口，结果越磨越不好用。在今后逐步推广大型的更复杂的农具时，传授技术问题也将愈益重要。因此，我们建议各地有关机关注意这个问题。
    一九五○年我们制造的小铡草机刀片，因材料关系，有少数硬度不够。这些刀片，有的我们发现后已经收回加工，使其达到规格的要求；各地发现后也可退给我厂加工改造。
    第三，零件损坏后的修配问题，中央农业部召集的新式农具推广座谈会上对此已作了具体决定。
