    Two Children on a Long-Distance Train
    Editor: On September 11th, I took the train from Guangzhou to Hengyang. In the sleeping car, I saw two children without any adults taking care of them. How could two children travel thousands of miles alone on a train! I spoke to them with great concern, and the older child told me about their situation.
    These two children are brothers. The older one is nine years old, named Lu Xiaodu; the younger one is seven years old, named Lu Wudu. Their mother is studying at an accounting training class in Guangzhou, and their father works in Guilin. Their mother wanted to send them to their father; but if she accompanied them herself, time and money would be a problem. She heard that the staff of the People's Railway provide excellent service to passengers, so she decided to let the two children go by themselves. On the day of departure, she took the children to the station and bought tickets. The berth was originally a middle bunk; but when the comrades at the station saw that the passengers were two children, they helped to arrange for a lower bunk. In addition, they specially filled out two "Attention Notice" forms for the train conductor and the Hengyang station where they would change trains, asking them to take extra care of these two little friends. Seeing this, the mother returned home reassured; and the two children boarded the train very happily.
    On the train, the train attendants cared for them very much, telling them the rules of the train, letting them play happily, and covering them with blankets at night. When they arrived at Hengyang station, the train to Guilin had not yet arrived. I was very worried: what would the two children do in a strange place? However, the train attendants took them to read books and play ball games with great care, so they were playing and laughing.
    Those two little friends must have arrived safely at their father's place. Even now, when I think about this incident, I feel even more that the motherland is great and lovable. Shi Zhongfang

    两个孩子在长途列车上
    编辑同志：九月十一日，我从广州乘火车到衡阳去。在卧车车厢里，我看见了两个没有大人照顾着的孩子。两个孩子自己不远千里乘火车，这怎么成！我很关心地和他们谈话，较大的一个孩子就把他们的情况告诉了我。
    这两个孩子是兄弟俩。大的九岁，叫卢小度；小的七岁，叫卢武度。他们的母亲在广州某会计训练班学习，父亲在桂林工作。母亲想把他们送到父亲那里去；但如果要亲自伴送，时间、金钱都成问题。她听说人民铁路工作人员为旅客服务得很好，就决定让两个小孩自己去。临走那天，她带孩子到车站买了票。卧铺的位置原是中铺；车站上的同志一见乘车的是两个小孩，就代为设法换了低铺。此外，还特地填了两张“乘务注意书”给车长和换车的衡阳车站，要他们多照顾这两位小朋友。母亲见到这种情形，放心地回去了；两位小朋友也就十分愉快地上了车。
    在车上，列车员同志们非常关心他俩，告诉他俩车上的规则，让他俩好好地玩，晚上还给他俩盖被子。到了衡阳车站，去桂林的车还没有到。我很耽心：两个孩子在一个陌生的地方怎么办呢？但是，列车员十分周到地带他俩去看书、玩球，使他俩有说有笑地玩着。
    那两位小朋友一定平安地到了他们的父亲那里。到如今，我一想起这件事，就更加感到祖国的伟大可爱。石中方
