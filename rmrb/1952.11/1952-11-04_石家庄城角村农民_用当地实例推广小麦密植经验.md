Farmers in Chengjiao Village, Shijiazhuang
Promote Dense Planting Experience of Wheat Using Local Examples

To the Editor: Before sowing wheat this year, many people in our village couldn't understand the advanced experience of dense planting and were unwilling to accept it. Later, we thought: One year, Liang Yin锁 and Liang Hong喜 in our village planted wheat, but the seedlings didn't emerge well, so they sowed again in the rows where they had originally sown. Later, both sowings sprouted, with a row spacing of only four and a half inches and a sowing rate of twenty catties per mu. As a result, they harvested four hundred catties per mu, more than one hundred catties more than ordinary wheat fields. At that time, everyone didn't understand the reason for the increased yield and didn't take it seriously. Now that we think about it, we realize that it was because of dense planting that they harvested more wheat. We combined this incident with the new technology promoted by the government and publicized it to the villagers, and most people believed that appropriate dense planting could increase yields. Our agricultural production cooperative and twenty-five mutual aid teams in Chengjiao Village all used the method of planting wheat with row spacing of four and a half and six inches, and the sowing rate was also increased. In addition, in the past, we only paid attention to applying more fertilizer but not to rational fertilization, and used more nitrogen fertilizer, which easily caused the wheat to lodge and delayed the harvest time. In the future, we should pay more attention to using fertilizers rich in phosphorus, such as bone meal and cottonseed cake, and pay attention to accumulating potash fertilizers such as grass ash and kang soil to apply to the wheat fields. We should also pay attention to timely watering. When the ground thaws next year, all groups and cooperatives in the village will also launch a spring harrowing competition. We will use various methods to ensure that the more than 500 mu of wheat in the twenty-five mutual aid teams yield an average of 350 catties per mu, and strive for 430 catties per mu. Our agricultural production cooperative's twelve mu of wheat will guarantee a yield of 550 catties per mu and strive for 700 catties per mu. In the past, farmers in our village were willing to grow more cotton and unwilling to grow more grain crops. This year, the government called for equal emphasis on cotton and grain, and many people couldn't understand it. Later, after everyone's discussion, they realized that the living standards of the people across the country have improved, and it is necessary to greatly increase wheat production. Everyone's patriotism has been enhanced, and they have also accepted the idea of equal emphasis on cotton and grain.

    Editor's Note: Using local examples of high yields, combined with science and technology, to promote advanced high-yield experience is a very good method. Although the winter wheat sowing season has passed, Chengjiao Village's method of promoting advanced high-yield experience is still worthy of learning by other regions.

    石家庄城角村农民
    用当地实例推广小麦密植经验
    编辑同志：今年种麦以前，我们村里许多人对于密植的先进经验还想不通，不肯接受。后来我们想到：有一年，我们村里的梁银锁、梁红喜种了麦子，没有出好苗，他们就在原来播种的行间又播了一次；后来两次种的都出苗了，行距只有四寸半，每亩播种量二十斤。结果每亩收了四百斤，比一般的麦地多收一百多斤。那时大家还不明白多收是什么道理，也就没有把这当成一回事。现在想起来，才知道这是因为密植，才多打了麦子。我们把这件事和现在政府提倡的新技术结合起来，向全村群众作了宣传，大部分人都相信了适当密植可以增加产量的道理。我们全城角村一个农业生产合作社和二十五个互助组，都用行距四寸五和六寸的靠垅两播法播种小麦，播种量也增加了。此外，过去我们这里也是只注意多施肥而不注意合理施肥，用氮肥较多，小麦容易倒伏，收获时间也晚，以后我们要注意多用骨粉、棉籽饼等含磷多的肥料，并注意积草木灰、炕土等钾质肥料，上在麦地里。我们还要注意适时浇水。明年解冻时，全村各组、社还要展开春耙竞赛。我们要用各种办法，保证二十五个互助组五百多亩小麦平均每亩收三百五十斤，争取每亩收四百三十斤。我们农业生产合作社的十二亩麦子，保证每亩收五百五十斤，争取每亩收到七百斤。过去我村农民愿意多种棉花，不愿意多种粮食作物，今年政府号召棉粮并重，许多人的思想都搞不通。后来经过大家讨论，认识到现在全国人民生活水平提高了，必须大量增加小麦。大家爱国心提高了，对于棉粮并重也接受了。

    编者按：用当地丰产的实例，结合科学技术，推广先进丰产经验，是一个很好的办法。虽然现在冬麦播种季节已经过去，城角村这种推广先进丰产经验的办法仍是可供各地学习的。
