Great Construction, Happy Life
-- Impressions After Viewing the "Soviet Photo Exhibition"
    Tan Wenrui Chen Youwei

The "Soviet Photo Exhibition" opened on November 8th at the Beijing Working People's Cultural Palace. This exhibition displays over a hundred exquisite and moving photographs. They vividly and systematically introduce the construction and navigation of the great communist construction project – the Lenin Volga-Don Canal, and depict the happy life of the Soviet people in the era of the great Stalin. People come here as if they have arrived at the scene of the great communist construction project, stepping into a happy paradise that inspires endless beautiful hopes.

The first part of the pictures immediately presents viewers with a large oil painting by the famous Soviet painter Nalbandian. In this oil painting, people see Lenin, the founder of the Soviet state, and Stalin jointly studying and planning the Soviet Union's national electrification plan and vision. "Communism is Soviet power plus electrification of the whole country," "...if Russia were covered by a dense network of power plants and powerful technical equipment, then our communist economic construction would become an example for the future socialist Europe and Asia." The great ideal expressed by Lenin during his lifetime is now being victoriously realized by the Soviet people under the leadership of Stalin. In the post-war years, the Soviet people rapidly recovered from the wounds of war, carried out large-scale peaceful construction, and confidently moved towards the most lofty and perfect ideal of mankind – communism. The Volga-Don Canal named after Lenin and the Tsimlyanskaya Hydroelectric Hub are the great water conservancy and power projects built by the Soviet people at an unprecedented speed, and also the first great victory achieved by the Soviet people in the cause of communist construction.

The exhibition's pictures take us to the grand construction site of the Lenin Canal. Here are presented various kinds of giant machines, conveyor belts composed of powerful scrapers, which are sending the scraped soil to the distance; there are floating dredgers like medium-sized steamboats; and there is the "long-striding" dredging giant – the self-propelled excavator, which is swinging its steel arm, moving the huge amount of soil dug up at one time to a place 65 meters away. This huge and complex excavator, operated by five people, has a working efficiency equivalent to 12,000 laborers. On the pictures of the Tsimlyanskaya Hydroelectric Hub construction site, people cannot help but be amazed by the long line of powerful overhead cranes working on the Tsimlyanskaya lock piers. In the face of this huge steel machine that almost soars into the clouds, people immediately realize that only the powerful socialist country of the Soviet Union can widely use such highly efficient machines and advanced technology to create a happy life for the people.

These pictures tell us that the construction of such a great hydropower project is not only the task of the builders, but also the common cause of all the Soviet people. All Soviet factories consider it an unparalleled honor to complete orders for the Lenin Canal and Tsimlyanskaya Hydroelectric Hub construction projects ahead of schedule. Workers at the "Ural Generator" factory are manufacturing turbines for powerful generators for the pumping stations of the Lenin Canal; workers at the "Novo-Kramatorsk-Stalin" factory are transporting the electrical equipment they manufactured to the Tsimlyanskaya Hydropower Station; scientists and experts at the Kirov Forestry Technology Academy and the Siberian Forestry Technology Research Institute are studying how to protect ships docking and use the canal to transport timber. Hundreds and thousands of Soviet scholars and many scientific research institutions have solved many complex technical problems for the construction project of the Lenin Canal and Tsimlyanskaya Hydroelectric Hub.

Under the selfless labor of the Soviet people day and night, the first great communist construction project was finally completed victoriously. On the glorious day of July 27, 1952, the Lenin Volga-Don Canal was officially opened to navigation, "Realizing the ideal of the Russian people for centuries to connect the Volga and the Don." A colorful passenger ship, the "Joseph Stalin" diesel engine steamship, fully loaded with passengers, first sailed into the Lenin Canal amidst the cheers of the crowd. This scene of enthusiastic scenes made the audience of the exhibition and the Soviet people feel equally happy and excited.

The opening of the Lenin Volga-Don Canal has brought great benefits to the Soviet national economy. People can see from the pictures that cargo ships full of timber, coal, grain, and other materials are coming from all directions and sailing to all directions, promoting the exchange of materials and bringing prosperity to the areas along the canal. The Lenin Canal and the water of the huge artificial reservoir "Tsimlyansk Sea" can also irrigate the surrounding grasslands, revitalizing the vast arid land that was originally plagued by hot winds, and growing countless wheat, grains, and cotton for its owner – the Soviet people. Several pictures show the bumper harvest of the Rostov Oblast land after being irrigated by river water. The wheat there has grown taller than human waists, and the golden and full ears of wheat are swaying in the wind. Trucks loaded with wheat are driving on the highway, with bright red slogans inserted on the trucks: "Give the best grain to our dear motherland!" This is the happy scene of the farmers of the "Molotov" collective farm in Rostov Oblast delivering public grain to the state after the harvest.

In the last few pictures, people see a completely newly built village – Tsimlyansk Village. It is inhabited by many builders and managers of the Lenin Canal and Tsimlyanskaya Hydroelectric Hub. On the newly opened streets, in front of the white buildings of the club, and in the seaside park, people are leisurely strolling and chatting. These pictures tell us that the Soviet people have created their own happy and joyful life with their own labor.

When people finish viewing the first part of the pictures, they will immediately be attracted by another moving color picture: a group of innocent and lovely Soviet children are offering a bunch of crimson flowers to their loving father and leader, Comrade Stalin. This picture centrally expresses the theme of the second part of the pictures: the great Stalin cares for the next generation of the entire Soviet state, and millions of Soviet children respect and love their leader Stalin as if they were their own father. Soviet children enjoy unlimited happiness and a beautiful life, and they truly become the flowers of mankind. The more than one hundred beautiful pictures here give people a strong impression: the Soviet motherland nurtures the next generation with strong physique and excellent qualities like a loving mother, creating all the conditions for their happy life.

In the Soviet Union, more than three million babies are born every year, and they receive care and attention from the state from the first day of their birth. The Soviet health care system is developing day by day, and factories and collective farms have their own maternity hospitals. A large number of maternal and child health consultation centers have been established in cities and villages to help mothers prevent children's diseases and pay attention to children's development and growth. Countless medical workers serve the health of children, sick children receive timely treatment, and children with weak bodies can go to sanatoriums to rest and recover. The state guarantees with all excellent conditions that the young generation grows up healthy and full of spirit.

Vast nurseries, kindergartens, and schools open their doors to children, and many educators and writers work selflessly to cultivate children's communist morality and lofty qualities. When American children are receiving war hysteria education on how to escape atomic bomb bombings every week, Soviet teachers are wholeheartedly educating children to love their motherland, love labor, and love peace; ten percent of the 11,000 middle school students in Los Angeles, USA, do not know that there are twelve months in a year, while Semenov, a nine-year-old in a Moscow kindergarten, has drawn a beautiful color picture showing the unity of the people of the world in defending peace; American publishers and filmmakers use a large number of low-taste comic strips and movies with pornography, superstition, and crime to poison children's minds, while Soviet children read novels, fairy tales, and fables specially written for them by excellent writers, and enjoy educational dramas and films in theaters and cinemas specially set up for them. In the Soviet Union, the work of educating children is regarded as an important responsibility of every citizen. Writers, actors, and artists often hold symposiums with children to discuss their works; famous scientists and advanced figures from factories and collective farms often approach children, telling them about the achievements and their own experiences in the country's economic and cultural construction, and helping them understand the surrounding life and new things. Soviet children happily participate in various extracurricular activities and mass work. Their interests and requirements for life, nature, technology, and art can be satisfied in the Young Pioneers' Palace and the "Young Pioneers' Home," in the "Young Technicians' Station" and the "Young Natural Scientists' Station"; they also often travel and visit to broaden their horizons and increase their understanding and understanding of the motherland and nature. The footprints of these young guests can be found in museums, tourist stations, factories, observatories, and the sites of various great construction projects.

Every Soviet child has a lofty and beautiful ideal, and firmly believes that their ideal can be realized in their dear motherland. Fifteen-year-old Brezhkalov hopes to become a sailor driving a ship on the Lenin Volga-Don Canal. He knows that "no one in our country will hinder my aspirations." Fourteen-year-old Demokhovskaya is willing to be a journalist reporting on the happy life of the Soviet people. She believes that "I will definitely be able to engage in the career I love in the future"; Thirteen-year-old Bryanskaya is preparing to be an astronomer studying the world of nebulae; tens of thousands of future scientists, writers, and artists are working hard to realize their ideals, and all roads are open to Soviet youth.

The "Soviet Photo Exhibition" is particularly cordial to the Chinese people who are about to launch large-scale economic construction and whose lives are getting better day by day. The Soviet Union's today is our tomorrow. The great construction and happy life of the Soviet people shown in the exhibition give us great encouragement, and it will make us work harder and be more confident to strive for the early arrival of our beautiful and happy future.

    伟大的建设，幸福的生活
    ——“苏联图片展览会”观后记
    谭文瑞  陈有为
    “苏联图片展览会”已于十一月八日在北京劳动人民文化宫开幕了。这次展览会展出了一百数十幅精美动人的图片。它们生动而系统地介绍了伟大共产主义建设工程——列宁伏尔加河—顿河运河的建筑与通航情景，表现了苏联人民在伟大斯大林时代的幸福生活的情形。人们来到这里就仿佛来到了伟大共产主义建设工程的现场，走进了一个使人产生无限美好希望的幸福的乐园。
    图片的第一部分，首先映入人们眼帘的是苏联著名画家纳尔邦疆所绘的大幅油画。在这幅油画上，人们看到苏维埃国家的缔造者列宁和斯大林正在共同研究与规划着苏联全国电气化的计划和远景。“共产主义就是苏维埃政权加上全国电气化”，“……如果俄国为发电站和强大的技术设备的密网所盖没，那么，我国共产主义经济建设就将成为未来的社会主义欧洲和亚洲的榜样。”列宁在生前所表示的伟大理想，现在正被斯大林所领导的苏联人民胜利地实现着。在战后的年代里，苏联人民迅速地恢复了战争的创伤，进行了大规模的和平建设，并满怀信心地向着人类最崇高美满的理想——共产主义迈进。以列宁命名的伏尔加河—顿河运河及齐姆良水利枢纽，就是苏联人民用空前的速度所建造完成的伟大水利电力工程，也是苏联人民在共产主义建设事业中所取得的第一个巨大胜利。
    展览的图片把我们带到了列宁运河的伟大建筑现场。这里呈现着各种各样的巨大机器，有效力强大的刮土机所组成的传送带，它们正在把刮起来的泥土送往远处；有像一只中等汽船的浮动挖泥机；还有那“高视阔步”的挖泥巨人——自动走动掘凿机，它正在摆动着自己的钢铁手臂，把一次挖掘起来的巨量泥土移往六十五公尺以外的地方去。这个由五个人操纵的庞大复杂的挖掘机，它的工作效能却等于一万二千个劳动力。在齐姆良水利枢纽建筑现场的图片上，人们看到那些正在齐姆良水闸桥墩上活动着的一长列强大的高架起重机，都不禁感到惊奇。在这种几乎耸入云霄的巨大钢铁机器面前，使人立刻认识到，只有强大的社会主义国家苏联，才能广泛地使用这种具有高度效能的机器和先进技术来为人民创造幸福的生活。
    这些图片告诉我们，建设这样伟大的水电工程，不仅是建设者们的任务，也是苏联全体人民的共同事业。苏联的各个工厂都认为提前完成列宁运河与齐姆良水利枢纽建设工程的定货，是无上光荣的事情。“乌拉尔发电机”工厂的工人在为列宁运河的抽水站制造供强力发电机应用的涡轮；“诺沃—克拉马托尔斯克—斯大林”工厂的工人们在把他们所制造的电气设备装运到齐姆良水电站去；基洛夫林业技术科学院、西伯利亚林业技术研究院里的科学家与专家们，在研究着如何保护船只停泊与利用运河运送木材的问题。成千成百个苏联学者和许多科学研究机关，为列宁运河与齐姆良水利枢纽的建设工程解决了不少复杂的技术问题。
    在苏联人民日以继夜的忘我劳动之下，第一个伟大的共产主义建设工程终于胜利完成了。在一九五二年七月二十七日这个光辉的节日里，列宁伏尔加河—顿河运河正式通航了，“俄罗斯人民多少世纪以来要把伏尔加河与顿河连接起来的理想实现了。”一艘满载着乘客的彩色缤纷的客轮——“约瑟夫·斯大林”号柴油引擎汽船，在人们的夹道欢呼中首先驶进了列宁运河。这一幅场面热烈的图景，使展览会的观众和苏联人民同样地感到愉快和兴奋。
    列宁伏尔加河—顿河运河的通航，对苏联国民经济有着巨大的利益。人们可以从图片中看到，一艘艘满载着木材、煤、谷物和其他物资的货船，正在从四面八方前来，又向四面八方驶去，它们促进了物资的交流，给运河沿岸地区带来了繁荣。列宁运河与巨大的人工水库“齐姆良海”的河水也能灌溉四周的草原，让原来遭受着热风侵袭的广大干旱土地复活过来，为它的主人——苏联人民生长出无数的小麦、谷物和棉花。有几幅图片表现了获得河水灌溉以后的罗斯多夫州土地的丰收。那里的小麦已经长过人腰，金黄色的饱满的麦穗在迎风飘摆，公路上行驶着满载小麦的卡车，卡车上插着鲜红的标语：“把最好的粮食交给亲爱的祖国！”这是罗斯多夫州“莫洛托夫”集体农庄农民在丰收后向国家送缴公粮的愉快情景。
    在最后的几幅图片上，人们看到了一个完全新建立起来的村庄——齐姆良村。那里居住着许多列宁运河与齐姆良水利枢纽的建设者与管理者。在新辟的街道上，在俱乐部的白色建筑物面前，在海滨公园里，人们正在悠然地漫步谈笑。这些图片告诉我们，苏联人民用自己的劳动，创造了自己幸福愉快的生活。
    人们看完了第一部分图片的时候，立刻又会被另一幅动人的彩色图画所吸引住：一群天真可爱的苏联儿童正在向他们慈爱的父亲和领袖斯大林同志献上一束紫红色的鲜花。这幅图画集中地表现了第二部分图片的主题：伟大的斯大林关怀着整个苏维埃国家的下一代，而千百万的苏联儿童像对慈父一样地敬重和爱戴自己的领袖斯大林。苏联儿童享受着无限幸福和美好的生活，他们真正成为人类的花朵。这里的一百多幅美丽的图片给人们一个强烈的印象：苏维埃祖国像慈母一样抚育着体格强健、品质优秀的下一代，给他们创造了幸福生活的一切条件。
    在苏联，每年有三百多万个婴儿诞生，他们从出生的第一天起就受到国家的关怀和照顾。苏联的保健事业日益发展，工厂和集体农庄都有自己的产科医院，在城市和乡村中建立了大量的妇婴健康谘询所，帮助母亲们预防儿童的疾病和注意儿童的发育和成长。无数的医务工作者为儿童的健康服务，染病的儿童得到及时的治疗，身体衰弱的儿童可以到疗养院去休息和恢复健康。国家以一切优良的条件保证了年青的一代壮健和精神饱满地成长起来。
    广大的托儿所、幼儿园和学校为儿童敞开着大门，许许多多教育工作者和文学家为培养儿童的共产主义道德与崇高品质而忘我地工作。当美国的儿童每星期在受着如何逃避原子弹轰炸的战争歇斯底里教育的时候，苏联的教师正全心全意在教育着儿童热爱祖国、热爱劳动与热爱和平；美国洛杉矶一万一千个中学生中有百分之十不知道一年有十二个月，而莫斯科幼儿园里九岁的谢敏诺夫却绘出了一幅表现世界人民团结保卫和平的美丽的彩色图画；美国的出版商和制片商用大量以色情、迷信和犯罪为内容的低级趣味的滑稽画报和电影来毒害儿童的心灵，而苏联的儿童却阅读着优秀的文学家专门为他们写作的小说、童话和寓言，在专为他们而设立的剧院和电影院里欣赏着富有教育意义的戏剧和影片。在苏联，教育儿童的工作被认为是每一个公民的重要责任，作家、演员和艺术家经常和儿童们举行座谈会，讨论他们的作品；著名的科学家和工厂与集体农庄的先进人物时常和儿童们接近，把关于国家经济和文化建设方面的成就和自己的经验告诉他们，帮助他们了解周围的生活和新鲜的事物。苏联的儿童愉快地参加各种课外活动和群众工作，他们对于生活，对于自然界，对于技术和艺术方面的兴趣与要求，可以在少先宫和“少先队员之家”中，在“少年技术工作者站”和“少年自然科学家站”里得到满足；他们并且经常旅行、参观，来扩大自己的眼界，增进自己对于祖国与自然界的认识和了解。博物馆、游览站、工厂、天文台和各种伟大建设工程的现场都有这些年轻客人的足迹。
    每一个苏联的儿童都怀有一个崇高美丽的理想，并且坚信在自己亲爱的祖国里一定可以实现自己的理想。十五岁的布雷兹卡洛夫希望成为一个在列宁伏尔加河—顿河运河上驾驶轮船的水手，他知道“在我们国家内没有任何人会妨碍我的志愿”，十四岁的德莫霍夫斯卡雅愿意做一个报道苏联人民幸福生活的新闻记者，她认为“我将来一定能从事自己所喜爱的事业”；十三岁的勃良勒斯卡雅准备做一个研究星云世界的天文学家；成千成万的未来的科学家、文学家、艺术家都正在为实现自己的理想而努力学习，一切道路都为苏联的青年开放着。
    “苏联图片展览会”对于即将展开大规模的经济建设、生活正在一天比一天美好起来的中国人民，是特别感到亲切的。苏联的今天，就是我们的明天。展览会中所表现的苏联人民的伟大建设与幸福生活，给我们以莫大的鼓舞，它将使我们更加努力并且更加信心百倍地去争取我们美满幸福的前途早日到来。（附图片）
