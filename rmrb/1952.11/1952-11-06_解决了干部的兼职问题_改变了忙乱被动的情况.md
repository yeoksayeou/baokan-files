To the Editors: I am a member of the Technical Security Group at the Shijingshan Power Plant. Before the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party announced its decision in August to protect the health of workers and rationally allocate leisure time, I concurrently held six positions: clerk of the Public Security Office, member of the inspection team of the Patriotic Production Increase Competition Office, member of the cultural and educational committee of the plant's trade union, propaganda officer of the Party, tutor for Party classes, and leader of the Party小组 directly under the Party branch (my actual work was equivalent to that of a branch secretary). Each week, I spent at least 22 hours of my spare time attending various meetings. At that time, I was constantly being sought out before I could finish one task, and I felt rushed, overwhelmed, and breathless. Aside from wishing I could "change the week to eight days," I could only encourage myself – "For the sake of the Party's work, what does a little less rest matter!" But could I truly do the Party's work well this way? No. A person who spends all day in meetings and lacks a clear head to think about problems can hardly go deep into reality to do good work. And because I had too much work and couldn't do it well, I became irritable and prone to arguing with people, which had some negative impact on the Party's image among the masses.

In August, under the leadership of the Municipal Committee, the Party branch committee announced that it would rationally allocate workers' leisure time. At first, I didn't quite understand, so I took a "wait-and-see" attitude. On September 27th, the Beijing Patriotic Production Increase and Thrift Campaign Committee Office held a meeting, specifying that key factories should resolutely implement this decision. This finally caught my attention. At this time, the Party branch committee of our factory also worked to resolve the problem of cadres holding multiple positions, established a series of scientific systems, and made reasonable provisions for allocating workers' leisure time. Not only was it not difficult to implement, but the benefits were obvious.

Now I only have three positions, including my original job, and I only need to attend meetings for ten hours a week. I can sleep for eight hours every day. As a result, the excessive fatigue is gone, and I am full of energy when attending meetings. A few days ago, we held a safety inspection meeting, and because I had time to prepare in advance, we gathered together and solved the problem in 30 minutes. In the past, such a meeting would have taken at least two hours. Work efficiency has improved. It used to take me two hours to draw an accident statistics table. Now it only takes me 30 minutes to write a monthly inspection plan for the Patriotic Production Increase Competition Office inspection team. In the past, I was controlled by time; now I can control my time and have the ability to talk to the masses individually in a planned way, which has also played a good role in uniting and educating the masses. As for when I return to the dormitory in the evening, I also have time to read newspapers and books, which is something I haven't had in years.

    解决了干部的兼职问题
    改变了忙乱被动的情况
    编辑同志：我是石景山发电厂技术保安组的组员。在八月间中共北京市委员会宣布保护职工身体健康，合理支配业余活动时间的决定以前，我兼任：治安保卫办公室的办事员、爱国增产竞赛办公室检查组的组员、厂工会的文教委员、党的宣传员、党课辅导员和党总支直属的党小组的小组长（实际工作相等于支部书记）等六个职务。我每周因参加各种会议至少需占业余时间二十二个小时以上。那时候，经常是这边的事未完，那边就有人找，又忙又乱，喘不过气来。除了恨不得“把一个星期改为八天以外”，就只有给自己打气—“为了党的工作，少休息会算啥！”其实，这样是不是可以真正把党的工作做好呢？没有。一个整天忙于开会，缺乏清醒的头脑思考问题的人，是很难深入实际做好工作的。而我自己也因为工作多，做不好，脾气暴躁，容易和人顶嘴，给党在群众中造成了一些不好的影响。
    八月间，在市委的领导下，党总支委员会宣布要合理支配职工的业余活动时间。乍开始，我的思想没有打通，因而我是抱住“走着瞧”的态度。九月二十七日，北京市爱国增产节约竞赛运动委员会办公室召开会议，指定重点工厂要坚决实施这一决定。这才引起我的重视。这时，我们工厂的党总支委员会也设法解决了干部的兼职问题，建立了一系列的科学的制度，合理支配职工业余时间的规定，不但执行起来没有困难，而且好处是显而易见的。
    我现在连本身的工作共只三职，每周只要开十小时的会就可以了，每天能睡足八小时。这样，身体过度疲劳的情形没有了，开起会来也精神饱满。前几天召开一个安全检查会议，因为事前有时间准备，大伙一围拢来，三十分钟就解决了问题。像这样的会议，过去开起来起码得两个钟头。工作效率提高了，我过去画一个事故统计表得两个钟头，现在给增产节约竞赛办公室检查组写一个一月检查计划，只要三十分钟就可以了。过去是受时间支配，现在自己能支配时间，能够有计划地找群众个别谈话了，这对团结和教育群众也起了好的作用。至于晚上回到宿舍以后，也能有时间读报和看书，这几乎是几年来没有过的事。    宗少权
