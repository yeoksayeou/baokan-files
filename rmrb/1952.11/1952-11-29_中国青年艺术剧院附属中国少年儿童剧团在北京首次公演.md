    China Youth Art Theatre Affiliated China Children's Theatre Troupe Gives First Performance in Beijing
    Starting from November 28th, the China Youth Art Theatre Affiliated China Children's Theatre Troupe is giving its first performances at the Beijing Youth Palace of the Soviet fairy tale "The Little White Rabbit" and the Chinese children's comedy "The Peaches Are Ripe," as a gift to the children of the capital during the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month." Among the two programs being performed, "The Little White Rabbit" (written by Soviet writer Sergei Mikhalkov and directed by Sun Weishi) aims to educate children on the importance of collective interests, illustrating that only through unity and friendship can strength be exerted, and that arrogance and conceit will bring great harm to the collective. "The Peaches Are Ripe" (original work by Ren Dalin, directed by Lu Yuanong) reflects the new moral character of the Young Pioneers in the new Chinese countryside who love the families of military personnel and help Uncle Sun, a military family member, save his peaches, undeterred by difficulties. Through the labor image of the new generation, it educates people to love the motherland and increase their confidence in striving for a better future.
    The China Children's Theatre Troupe was established after the end of the literary rectification campaign in August of this year. The troupe's predecessor was the China Youth Art Theatre's Children's Art Work Team, and even earlier, the Children's Team of the Second Regiment of the Northeast Cultural Troupe, which was active on the front lines of Northeast China and during the land reform in the Liberation War.

    中国青年艺术剧院附属中国少年儿童剧团在北京首次公演
    中国青年艺术剧院附属中国少年儿童剧团自十一月二十八日起在北京青年宫首次公演苏联童话剧“小白兔”和中国儿童喜剧“桃子熟了”，作为在“中苏友好月”中向首都少年儿童的献礼。这次演出的两个节目中，“小白兔”（苏联谢·米海尔柯夫编剧，孙维世导演）是教育儿童重视集体利益的，它说明只有团结友爱才能发挥力量，骄傲自大将会给集体带来很大的危害。“桃子熟了”（任大霖原著，鲁亚农导演）反映了新中国农村中的少年儿童队员们热爱军属，不畏艰难地帮助军属孙大伯抢救桃子的新道德品质。通过新的一代的劳动形象，教育人们热爱祖国和提高为美好前途奋斗的信心。
    中国少年儿童剧团是在今年八月文艺整风结束之后成立的。该团的前身是中国青年艺术剧院少年儿童艺术工作队，再早是解放战争中活跃在东北前线和土地改革中的东北文工团第二团的儿童队。
