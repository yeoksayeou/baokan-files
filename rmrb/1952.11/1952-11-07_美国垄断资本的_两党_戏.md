American voters were given the "right to elect" a president, a vice president, thirty-five senators (one-third of the ninety-six seats in the Senate, plus three special elections to fill vacancies), four hundred and thirty-five (all) members of the House of Representatives, and several governors from a long list of candidates designated by the Democratic and Republican parties. In order to paint this American-style election with a deceptive "democratic" color, the two parties, as usual, stage a noisy campaign across the country to compete for power and profit before the election. The American bourgeoisie calls this performance a full manifestation of American democracy. However, since the American state apparatus, economy, propaganda organs, and even living conditions are controlled by monopoly capitalists, and the Democratic and Republican parties, the two ruling parties, are merely a pair of accomplices under these monopoly capitalists, this "democratic election" becomes a pure fraud. Because no matter who enters the White House, the elephant or the donkey (the emblems of the Republican and Democratic parties), it is these people sitting securely in the harem of Wall Street who are truly issuing orders.

Everyone knows that the politicians of the Democratic and Republican parties are all diners of Wall Street, and behind them are the big capitalists of American banks, steel, oil, arms, chemical and other monopoly enterprises who have grown fat by making war fortunes and cruelly exploiting the workers' blood and sweat. Just by looking at the list of presidential campaign planners and supporters of the two parties, you can know who is controlling the American election.

This year, several of the largest financial-industrial capital groups in the United States, including the Morgan, Rockefeller, DuPont, Mellon, Ford and other large consortia, have favored Republican presidential candidate Eisenhower. Representatives of these financial empires, such as Aldrich, Chairman of New York Chase Bank; Watson, Chairman of New York International Business Machines; George Sloan, Chairman of the Council of the American International Chamber of Commerce; Alfred Sloan, General Manager of General Motors; Henry Collier, General Manager of Arabian-American Oil Company; John Hay Whitney, owner of New York Whitney Company and financier; auto magnate Ford; Drake, General Manager of Mellon-controlled Gulf Oil Company and Director of Mellon National Bank and Trust Company; Will, Chairman of United States Steel Corporation; Reed, Chairman of General Electric Company and International General Electric Company, etc., are all strong supporters of Eisenhower.

In order to set off Eisenhower's "campaign," these true rulers of the United States have this year additionally picked out a little-known Democratic governor, Stevenson, to perform this election farce together with Eisenhower.

So Stevenson came out and sang a call-and-response song with Eisenhower in different tones. When Eisenhower said that the work of "containing communism" had not been effective, Stevenson said: "We should continue to build 'strength.'" Eisenhower blamed the United States for fighting a losing battle in Korea, and Stevenson shouted: "We must continue to fight." The noisy quarrel between them, in addition to reflecting the confusion and internal strife caused by the American ruling group's failure in implementing its aggressive policy everywhere, also serves to make American voters at a loss, and no matter which one is elected, they will still implement the same aggressive war preparation policy, and still let those big bosses continue to make money.

What is very ridiculous is the following trick: Stevenson and his number one campaign helper Truman often attack Eisenhower's relationship with big monopoly capital in order to whitewash themselves and make people think that Stevenson is not that kind of character. In fact, Stevenson's close relationship with American monopoly capital is at least no less than Eisenhower's. According to revealed materials, Stevenson has received strong support from one of the major financial groups in the United States, the Chicago Consortium, and also has close ties with Rockefeller's "New York Mobil Oil Company," Mellon's "Aluminum Company of America" and other monopoly enterprises.

In order to make the "campaign" look realistic, the two parties spent huge amounts of money, mobilized all radio and television broadcasting stations, newspapers, and magazines to hype it up, and at the same time organized bizarre campaign rallies and activities, creating a smoky atmosphere across the country. It is revealed that Eisenhower spent 20 million U.S. dollars in the Republican presidential nomination campaign alone. According to Senator Noeberger's estimate, the total campaign expenses of the two parties this year will break previous records, reaching 150 million U.S. dollars. These funds are provided by those backstage bosses. And past investigations have shown that those largest monopoly capital groups usually contribute money to both sides. Therefore, whether it is Eisenhower or Stevenson, they are only different faces, and their task of entering the White House is to protect and expand the profits of American monopoly capital.

The spokesmen of American monopoly capital are doing their best to promote the "democracy" of the American two-party system, but only the two parties employed by Wall Street can unscrupulously conduct the election campaign, and any people's party that wants to participate in the election campaign will be subject to many restrictions under this so-called "two-party" "democratic" system, to the point where it is impossible to campaign at all. In many states, the laws stipulate harsh and even impossible conditions for third parties to conduct election campaigns. At the same time, the entire propaganda machine in the hands of monopoly capital serves as the loudspeaker of the Democratic and Republican parties. Here, we do not mention the "legal" and illegal destruction and persecution of any election activities of progressive parties. In this way, the so-called "democracy" of the two-party system is actually the dictatorship of true monopoly capital. That is why the newspapers and news agencies of American monopoly capital have already calmly predicted before the election that no matter who is elected, there is no need to worry about any changes in the basic policies of the American government.

### 美国垄断资本的“两党”戏

    美国垄断资本的“两党”戏
    十一月四日是美国四年一度的大选在今年的选举日。在这一天，美国的选民们被给予了在民主、共和两党指定的长串名单中挑选一个总统、一个副总统、三十五个参议员（参议院九十六席的三分之
    一，加三名缺额补选）、四百三十五个（全部）众议员以及若干州长的“选举权”。为了替这种美国式的选举涂上骗人的“民主”色彩，两党在选举前照例要锣鼓喧天地在全国进行争权夺利的竞选。美国资产阶级就把这种演出叫作美国的民主的充分表现。但是，由于美国的国家机器、经济、宣传机关以至生活条件都掌握在垄断资本家的手里，而民主党、共和党这两个统治的大党只是这些垄断资本家手下的一对沆瀣一气的代理人，这种“民主的选举”就成了纯粹的骗局。因为无论是谁进白宫，大象或是驴子（这是共和党和民主党的徽号），真正发号施令的都是这些安坐在华尔街的后宫里的人。
    谁都知道，民主、共和两党的政客都是华尔街的食客，在他们背后牵着线的是依靠发战争财和残酷剥削工人的血汗而长肥了的美国银行、钢铁、石油、军火、化学等垄断企业的大资本家。只要看一下两党总统竞选策划人和撑腰人的名单，就可以知道是那些人在左右着美国大选。
    今年，美国几个最大的金融——工业资本集团，包括摩根、洛克菲勒、杜邦、梅隆、福特等大财阀在内，都垂青于共和党总统候选人艾森豪威尔。代表这些金融帝国的巨头们，诸如纽约大通银行董事长阿德利治，纽约国际商用机器公司董事长瓦生，美国国际商会理事会主席乔治·斯隆，通用汽车公司总经理阿佛伦德·斯隆，阿拉伯—美国石油公司总经理亨利·柯立尔，纽约惠特尼公司老板、金融家约翰·海伊·惠特尼，汽车大王福特，梅隆控制的海湾石油公司总经理、梅隆国民银行与信托公司董事德拉克，美国钢铁公司董事长威尔，奇异电气公司及国际奇异电力公司董事长瑞德等等，都是艾森豪威尔的有力支持人。
    为了陪衬艾森豪威尔的“竞选”，这些美国的真正统治者今年另外又挑出了一个很少人知道的民主党州长史蒂文森，出来和艾森豪威尔合演这出选举双簧。
    于是史蒂文森就出来用不同的调子和艾森豪威尔合唱对口曲。当艾森豪威尔说“遏止共产主义”工作作得没有成效，史蒂文森就说：应该继续建立“实力”。艾森豪威尔责怪美国在朝鲜打了败仗，史蒂文森就喊：必须继续打下去。他们之间的嘈杂的争吵，除了反映美国统治集团因为执行侵略政策到处失败而引起的混乱和内部閧争，其作用之一，还在使美国选民茫然无所适从，而不论选出那一个，还是执行那同一个侵略备战政策，还是让那些大老板继续发财。
    非常滑稽的是这样的把戏：史蒂文森和他的头号竞选帮手杜鲁门常常攻击艾森豪威尔和大垄断资本的关系，借以粉饰自己，使人以为好像史蒂文森不是那种角色。而事实上，史蒂文森与美国垄断资本关系之密切，至少不下于艾森豪威尔。据已经被揭发的材料，史蒂文森得到美国主要财团之一、芝加哥财团的有力支持，同时又和洛克菲勒的“纽约美孚油公司”、梅隆的“美国铝公司”等垄断企业有着密切联系。
    为了把“竞选”表演得逼真，两党花了巨额经费，发动所有的电台、电视广播台、报纸、杂志大吹大擂，同时组织光怪陆离的竞选集会和活动，在全国制造一片乌烟瘴气。据透露，艾森豪威尔在共和党总统候选人提名竞选中，就花了两千万美元。又据参议员诺埃伯格估计，两党今年的竞选费用，将打破以往纪录，总计将达一亿五千万美元。这些经费就是那些后台老板们供给的。而且过去的调查已经表明，那些最大的垄断资本集团照例是两边出钱的。因此，不论艾森豪威尔或是史蒂文森，只是脸谱的不同，他们进白宫的任务都是保障并扩大美国垄断资本的利润。
    美国垄断资本的代言人竭力宣扬美国两党制的
    “民主”，但竞选却只有华尔街御用的两党可以放肆地进行，任何人民的政党要参加竞选，都要在这种所谓“两党”的“民主”制度下受到许多限制，以至根本无从竞选。在许多州里，法律都对第三党进行竞选规定了苛刻得以至无法办到的条件。同时，掌握在垄断资本的手里的全套宣传机器，都充当民主与共和两党的喇叭。这里还不提对进步政党的任何竞选活动的“合法的”和非法的破坏和迫害。这样，所谓两党制的“民主”，其实际意义就是真正的垄断资本的专政。这就是为什么美国垄断资本的报纸和通讯社早在选举以前就已经泰然地预告，不论谁当选，不必担心美国政府基本政策有所改变的道理。
