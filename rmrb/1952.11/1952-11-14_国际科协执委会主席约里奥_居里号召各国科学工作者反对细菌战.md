    Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 13th -- Paris Dispatch: Joliot-Curie, Chairman of the Executive Committee of the World Federation of Scientific Workers, wrote to the heads of scientific worker organizations in various countries participating in the Federation on October 24th, calling on scientific workers of all countries to take action to oppose bacteriological warfare and to demand that all countries ratify the Geneva Protocol prohibiting the use of bacteriological weapons.
    In his letter, Joliot-Curie recounted the proceedings of the 11th Executive Committee meeting of the World Federation of Scientific Workers held in Vienna on May 31st and June 2nd this year. The letter stated: At that meeting, the Chinese delegation presented a report on the facts of bacteriological warfare in Korea and China. The Executive Committee members attending the Vienna meeting learned of this news and were convinced that the evidence accusing the American army was irrefutable. The United States government and its military leaders have denied these accusations, but they have not declared their opposition to the principle of bacteriological warfare.
    Joliot-Curie then introduced the members of the "International Scientific Commission for the Investigation of the Facts Concerning Bacteriological Warfare in Korea and China" and quoted their conclusion after investigation confirming that the American army used bacteriological weapons to attack the Korean and Chinese people. He said: "Upon seeing this conclusion, I felt obliged to ask our various branch organizations to consider all the problems caused by bacteriological warfare with the greatest attention in the shortest possible time. Our Association's General Assembly has passed resolutions demanding the prohibition of the use of weapons of mass slaughter, especially atomic weapons and bacteriological weapons. These serious events have made it an urgent task for the branches to vigorously implement these resolutions. The members of the Executive Committee believe that scientific workers have an obligation to use all the most appropriate methods—articles, pamphlets, discussions, films, advertisements…etc.—to inform their own people of the dangers that bacteriological weapons will bring to mankind, and to make them aware of the international obligations undertaken on this issue."
    Joliot-Curie emphasized: "In order to comply with our organizational charter, to comply with our conventions and the resolutions we have made in the past, we should take action to effectively oppose bacteriological warfare. This is precisely the inescapable obligation of our scientific workers, to oppose the complete misuse of science, which risks eliminating the true purpose of science in the minds of many people. In particular, we should take action to get all countries to ratify the 1925 Geneva Protocol prohibiting the use of bacteriological weapons, or to invite those countries that have already signed the Protocol but have not yet ratified it to do so."

    国际科协执委会主席约里奥—居里号召各国科学工作者反对细菌战
    【新华社布拉格十三日电】巴黎消息：国际科学工作者协会执行委员会主席约里奥—居里在十月二十四日写信给参加协会的各国科学工作者组织负责人，号召各国科学工作者行动起来，反对细菌战和要求各国批准禁止使用细菌武器的日内瓦议定书。
    约里奥—居里在信中追述了今年五月三十一日和六月二日在维也纳举行的国际科学工作者协会第十一届执行委员会的情形。信中说：在那次会议上，中国代表提出关于在朝鲜和中国进行细菌战事实的报告。出席维也纳会议的执行委员会委员们获悉这些消息后，都坚信用以控诉美国军队的罪证是确凿的。美国政府和它的军事领袖们曾否认这些谴责，但是它们却没有声明反对细菌战争的原则。
    约里奥—居里接着介绍了“调查在朝鲜和中国的细菌战事实国际科学委员会”的各位委员，并摘引了他们调查后证实美国军队使用细菌武器攻击朝鲜及中国人民的结论。他说：“见到这个结论后，我认为我有义务要求我们的各分会组织，在最短期间内尽可能地以最大的注意力，来考虑细菌战争所引起的全部问题。我们协会大会开会时已通过决议，要求禁止使用大规模屠杀的武器，特别是原子武器和细菌武器。目前的这些严重事件，已使各分会大力来实行这些决议成为迫切的任务。执行委员会的委员们认为，科学工作者有义务使用各种最恰当的方法——文章、小册子、讨论会、电影、广告……等，告诉他们本国人民细菌武器将使人类遭遇的危险，并使他们认识到关于这个问题国际间所承担的义务。”
    约里奥—居里着重指出：“为了符合我们的组织章程，符合我们的公约和我们过去所作的决议，我们应该行动起来，有效地反对细菌战争。这正是我们科学工作者责无旁贷的义务，反对科学的完全误用，这种误用有在许多人的心目中消灭科学的真正用途的危险。特别是我们应该行动起来，争取所有的国家批准禁止使用细菌武器的一九二五年日内瓦议定书，或是邀请那些已经在议定书上面签字而尚未批准的国家批准。”
