On behalf of all the workers in Beijing, I would like to express our gratitude to our Soviet friends and extend our highest brotherly salute."

Wu Han said: "The people of the capital love the Soviet Union. We firmly remember that the Soviet Union is our good teacher and helpful friend, and the Soviet Union's today is our tomorrow. We are advancing along the path indicated by the October Socialist Revolution."

He excitedly said, "This banner serves as a symbol of our eternal and unbreakable friendship. We have performed the art of the Soviet army and the Soviet people with extreme pleasure. We believe that our performance will consolidate the unity of our two peoples."
