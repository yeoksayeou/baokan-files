    Adjusting Specialized Technical Personnel with the Correct Attitude
    Wang Jie
    Editor's Note: This article criticizes the phenomenon in some departments in Northwest China where they have not yet "adjusted specialized technical personnel with the correct attitude." This phenomenon exists to varying degrees throughout the country and is unacceptable. Our country is about to embark on large-scale economic construction, and without a large number of technical personnel, large-scale economic construction is impossible. Therefore, we must not allow our country's limited number of technical personnel to continue to be kept in non-technical positions. This practice is actually hindering our country's economic construction. To draw everyone's attention to this issue, we are publishing this article here.
    In order to welcome the motherland's large-scale economic construction and prepare sufficient specialized technical personnel, the Personnel Department of the Northwest Military and Political Committee, in accordance with the "Instructions on Several Issues in the Work of Adjusting College Graduates" issued by the State Council of the Central People's Government on June 18 and the People's Daily editorial of June 14, "Put Specialized Technical Personnel in the Positions Most Needed for Economic Construction," issued a notice on July 5 to the People's Governments of the five provinces and one city in Northwest China and the units of the Greater Administrative Region to investigate, register, and adjust various specialized technical personnel who have not yet been reasonably used. The notice called on all departments to truly recognize the significant importance of rationally using specialized technical personnel and to quickly and resolutely adjust various specialized technical personnel to the positions most needed for economic construction, especially adjusting industrial construction personnel to industrial construction positions. Only in this way can the existing specialized technical personnel play a greater role in the motherland's various construction undertakings.
    Since the issuance of the above notice, three months ago, many departments have been able to earnestly and actively carry out the work of rationally adjusting and using technical personnel and have achieved considerable results. In order to successfully complete this task, the Northwest Regional Branch of the People's Bank of China convened relevant cadres from its affiliated units to a meeting to arrange this work and called on everyone to study relevant documents. When registering specialized technical personnel, the individuals first filled out registration forms, and the Personnel Department of the Northwest Regional Branch of the People's Bank of China conducted responsible reviews of cadres who were not well-understood or very unfamiliar. Therefore, the investigation and registration work of the Northwest Regional Branch of the People's Bank of China and its affiliated units was relatively thorough. In various work positions, some technical personnel who had not yet been reasonably used or who had been retained for administrative work due to work needs have actively put forward reasonable suggestions to the organization, requesting adjustments to their work.
    However, it is undeniable that there are still many serious shortcomings in carrying out this work. The main problem is that some departments do not have a deep understanding of the significant importance of adjusting specialized technical personnel and the role that technical personnel can play in the motherland's large-scale economic construction. As a result, there has been a phenomenon of insufficient consideration of the overall situation and a preoccupation with the gains and losses of one's own unit, which has slowed down the progress of this work, so that it is still stuck in the investigation and registration stage today, unable to proceed with adjustments quickly. Some departments are satisfied with the adjustments made during the "Three-Anti" movement, believing that there are no more problems, and therefore do not conduct detailed investigations and adjustments, failing to further ensure that people are assigned to suitable positions and that people are used to their full potential. They fear that "investigation" and "registration" will cause "emotional fluctuations" among cadres, and dare not boldly conduct public registration, instead responding with evasion. The heads of some departments verbally admit that "technical personnel have not been rationally used," but they lack the courage to make adjustments to enable technical personnel to play a greater role, and still keep personnel with specialized skills in textiles, machinery, and other fields in administrative positions. Some business departments, whose administrative work could be handled by general administrative cadres, place personnel with specialized skills in water conservancy, horticulture, or even machinery and metallurgy in personnel work positions. They emphasize that their department is a technical department, saying that administrative work is related to technical work, and that some people who understand technology are needed to be competent. The schools and institutes in Northwest China registered more than 40 specialized technical personnel who had not been rationally used. After reporting to the Education Department of the Northwest Military and Political Committee, the reports were held up and not submitted. The comrades in charge of personnel work emphasized: "The central instructions are to adjust college graduates, and none of the people here have graduated. After the State Council and the Personnel Department of the Northwest Military and Political Committee revise the instructions and notices, we will submit our registration forms." The Animal Husbandry Department of the Northwest Military and Political Committee placed a person with specialized knowledge of crop breeding and cultivation and many years of work experience in a secretarial position. After the Personnel Department of the Northwest Military and Political Committee requested a transfer multiple times, the person was not transferred.
    All of these phenomena show that the responsible cadres and personnel workers in some of our departments still do not have a true understanding of the significance of rationally using technical cadres and of using our country's limited number of technical personnel in urgently needed technical production and construction positions. Therefore, in actual implementation, many problems have arisen. The responsible cadres and personnel workers of all departments must deeply understand the great significance of adjusting specialized technical personnel in the new situation. Cadres who are urgently needed should be resolutely and unhesitatingly transferred. If specialized technical personnel are still placed in administrative positions or in other work positions that do not require technology, it is not only a serious waste of human resources but also a great loss to the country's economic construction work.
    The Central People's Government Personnel Department's policy for the allocation of college graduates this year is to concentrate use and focus on key deployments, first trying to meet the needs of basic construction as much as possible, and secondly strengthening education construction and scientific research work. At a time when a high tide of economic construction is about to arrive and there is a severe shortage of various specialized technical personnel, this policy is very correct and should be resolutely implemented. And adjusting specialized technical personnel to the positions most needed by the motherland's construction cause is completely in line with this policy. Let us, with the spirit of "the individual obeys the collective, and the part obeys the whole," thoroughly eliminate individualism and departmentalism, and completely and rationally use all specialized technical personnel who have not been rationally used.

### 以正确态度调整专门技术人材

    以正确态度调整专门技术人材
    王杰
    编者按：这篇文章批评了西北某些部门还没有“以正确态度调整专门技术人材”的现象。这种现象，在全国各地都还程度不同地存在着。这是不能允许的。我们国家即将开展大规模的经济建设，而没有大批的技术人材，就不可能进行大规模的经济建设。因此，我们绝不能允许我国为数不多的技术人材，继续被留在非技术的岗位上。这种作法，实际上是在阻挠我们国家的经济建设。为了引起大家对这个问题的注意，我们把这篇文章发表在这里。
    为了迎接祖国大规模的经济建设，准备足够的专门技术人材，西北军政委员会人事部根据中央人民政府政务院六月十八日“关于调整高等学校毕业生工作中几个问题的指示”和人民日报六月十四日“把专门技术人材放到经济建设最需要的岗位上去”的社论的精神，曾于七月五日向西北五省一市的人民政府及大行政区各单位发出调查、登记和调整尚未被合理使用的各种专门技术人材的通知，号召各部门真正认识合理使用专门技术人材的重大意义，把各种专门技术人材迅速、坚决地调整到经济建设最需要的岗位上去，特别是把工业建设人材调整到工业建设的岗位上去。只有如此，才能使现有的专门技术人材在祖国各项建设事业中，发挥其更大的作用。
    上述通知发出后，三个月以来，很多部门都能认真地积极进行合理调整使用技术人员的工作，并获得了相当成绩。人民银行西北区行为了圆满地实现这一任务，曾召集所属单位的有关干部开会，布置此项工作，号召大家学习有关文件。在登记专门技术人材时，首先由本人填写登记表，人民银行西北区行人事处又对不甚了解或很不了解的干部进行了负责的审查。因此，人民银行西北区行及其附属各单位的调查、登记工作作得比较彻底。在各种工作岗位上，有些尚未被合理使用或曾因工作需要留作行政工作的技术人员，都纷纷向组织提出合理建议，要求调整他们的工作。
    但是，不可否认的，在进行这一工作中，也还存在着许多严重的缺点。主要的是有些部门对于调整专门技术人材的重大意义，对于技术人员在祖国大规模经济建设中可能发挥的作用，认识还不深刻，因而发生了照顾全局不够，计较本位得失的现象，使得这一工作的进行较为迟缓，以致今天还停留在调查、登记阶段，不能迅速进行调整。有的部门满足于在“三反”运动中的调整工作，认为再没有什么问题，因此不再进行详细调查和调整，不能进一步使得事宜其人，人得其用。他们唯恐“调查”“登记”引起干部“情绪波动”，不敢大胆进行公开登记而应付推诿。有的部门的负责人口头承认“对技术人员没有合理使用”，但却缺乏足够的勇气进行调整，使技术人员发挥更大的作用，而依然将具有纺织、机械等专门技术的人员，留在行政工作岗位上。有些事业部门，其行政工作本是一般行政干部可以担任的，但却把具有水利、园艺以至机械、冶炼等专门技术的人员，放在人事工作岗位上。他们强调自己的部门是技术部门，说行政工作是与技术工作相联系的，要有些懂得技术的人，才能胜任。西北各校、院共登记了未被合理使用的专门技术人员四十余人，报到西北军政委员会教育部后，被积压下来不予上报。管人事工作的同志强调说：“中央指示调整的是高等学校毕业生，我们这里的都没有毕业。政务院和西北军政委员会人事部将指示与通知修改以后，我们的登记表再上报”。西北军政委员会畜牧部把具有农作物育种培植专门知识并有多年工作经验的人，放在秘书工作岗位上，经西北军政委员会人事部商调多次，也未调出来。
    所有这些现象，都说明我们某些部门的负责干部和人事工作者，对于合理地使用技术干部，对于把我们国家现有的为数有限的技术人员用在迫切需要技术的生产建设岗位上的意义，还是没有真正的认识。因此，在实际执行上就发生了不少的问题。各部门的负责干部和人事工作者必须深刻体会处在新形势调整专门技术人员的重大意义。凡是急切需要的干部，就应当坚决地、毫不犹豫地调整出来。如果仍把专门技术人材放在行政工作岗位上或放在其他不需要技术的工作岗位上，不只是一种严重的人力浪费，而且会给予祖国经济建设工作以巨大的损失。
    中央人民政府人事部今年分配高等学校毕业生的方针是集中使用重点配备，首先尽量满足基本建设的需要，其次加强教育建设与科学研究工作。在经济建设高潮即将到来，各种专门技术人材奇缺的今天，这个方针是非常正确的，应该坚决贯彻执行。而把专门技术人材调整到祖国建设事业最需要的岗位上去，是和这一方针完全相符合的。让我们以“个体服从整体、部分服从全局”的精神，彻底清除个人主义与本位主义，把所有一切未被合理使用的专门技术人员，完全合理地使用起来。
