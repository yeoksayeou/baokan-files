Xinhua News Agency, Eighteenth dispatch from London: Under the threat of a serious economic crisis, an increasing number of people in Britain are calling for the development of trade between East and West.

Recently, a memorandum signed by seventy-seven people demanding a break in the current East-West trade deadlock was submitted to Churchill. Signatories include trade union officials, trade union council officials, and conveners of representative committees from various important factory workshops.

The memorandum stated that the current crisis in British foreign trade could be resolved by breaking the "current deadlock between East and West." The key to resolving this deadlock lies in Britain signing a large-scale, long-term trade agreement with the Soviet Union. The memorandum pointed out: Signing such an agreement could reduce the increasingly serious unemployment phenomenon, guarantee long-term sales, and help maintain world peace.

Bingham, a member of the Sino-British Friendship Association delegation that visited China in September this year, published an article in the "Reynold News" after returning to his country, commenting on the huge potential for trade with China. He pointed out that trade between Britain and China is now only one-fifth of what it used to be. If it were not for the British government pursuing the US embargo policy, the booming new China could absorb many British industrial products and supply Britain with a large number of urgently needed goods. Britain is suffering from a shortage of US dollars, while China is a country that does not need to use US dollars for purchases. He criticized the embargo policy as "not seeing its benefits for Western countries, but seeing its harm first, losing a vast market in China."

Former Labor government trade minister Wilson expressed his opinion in London on October 28, accusing the United States of depriving Britain of its export market. He advocated developing trade with the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries.

Former Labor MP Pritt said at a rally in London on November 8 that Britain was prohibited from trading with 800 million people, thus losing a reliable market. He said: "Britain is now competing with Germany and Japan, both of which are supplied with funds by those who prohibit Britain from trading with the Far East."

Xinhua News Agency, Eighteenth dispatch: The "Liberation Newspaper" in Paris reported that on the 13th, the Economic Committee of the French National Assembly unanimously passed the following resolution: "The Economic Committee believes that in the interests of the French economy, it is extremely important to develop international trade as much as possible; this trade is a source of wealth, progress, and mutual understanding, and is also a prerequisite for easing international tensions. Therefore, it urges the government to put aside political considerations and use all possible means to promote and develop trade with all countries that can export and import, without exception."

The resolution of the Economic Committee of the French National Assembly illustrates that the United States' arbitrary policy of restricting East-West trade is encountering increasing resistance.

Xinhua News Agency, Eighteenth dispatch: Since the British Conservative government came to power, it has continued to follow the United States in expanding armaments and preparing for war, and pursuing discriminatory foreign trade policies, which have further deepened the British economic crisis. The Conservative government once advocated using so-called "super-economy" that doubles the reduction of people's living standards and the so-called "export movement" to strengthen foreign trade to solve difficulties, but the facts over the past year have proved that the Conservative Party's approach has not been effective. The fact is that British exports continue to decline, industry continues to shrink, unemployment continues to increase, prices continue to rise, and people's living standards continue to deteriorate.

Due to the shrinking capitalist world market and the increasing squeezing of British interests by the United States, Japan, and West Germany, British exports have been continuously shrinking this year. The average monthly value of British exports in the first quarter of this year was 239.5 million pounds, which fell to 212.1 million pounds in the second quarter, and further fell to 191.6 million pounds in the third quarter. The export volume in the third quarter of this year decreased by more than 80 million pounds compared with the third quarter of last year. Although the Conservative government has announced three times to reduce imports, totaling 600 million pounds, the trade deficit in the first nine months of this year still reached 656.7 million pounds. Since Britain cannot earn US dollars in foreign trade, it has to use gold and US dollar reserves to make up for the international payment deficit. As a result, Britain's gold and US dollar reserves by the end of September this year were only 1.685 billion US dollars, far lower than the minimum safe reserve of 2 billion US dollars considered by the British Treasury.

In terms of production, the implementation of the arms expansion plan and trade controls have continuously reduced the production of peaceful industries, far exceeding the extent to which military production can offset it. According to the official British index, British industrial production in the first half of this year decreased by about 2.5 percent compared with the first half of last year, and decreased by nearly 10 percent in June this year compared with June last year. The textile industry, one of Britain's main civilian and export industries, reduced its production by nearly one-fifth in the first half of this year compared with the same period last year.

The reduction of civilian and export industries has led to a continuous increase in the number of unemployed people. Since the Conservative government came to power last October, unemployment has increased month by month. According to official British materials, unemployment in May this year reached 517,600 people, an increase of nearly double compared with last October. Only after the British government was forced to relax certain trade restrictions, the serious unemployment in departments such as the textile industry was reduced.

High prices are another consequence of arms expansion, war preparation, and trade reduction. Under the government's large-scale reduction of food subsidies, food price increases have been particularly severe. In the first six months of this year, British prices rose by an average of 6 percent, while workers' wages increased by only 2 percent during the same period. Over the past year, even according to the statistics of the British Labor Department, the cost of living has risen by 11 percent. Since October 5, the British government has once again cut food price subsidies, increasing the expenditure per person per week for purchasing rationed food by another one and a half shillings.

    【新华社十八日讯】伦敦消息：在严重的经济危机的威胁下，英国国内越来越多的人要求发展东西方之间的贸易。
    最近有一个由七十七人签名要求打破目前东西方贸易僵局的备忘录提交邱吉尔。签名人包括工会职员、工会理事会职员和各重要工厂车间代表委员会召集人。
    这个备忘录说，目前英国对外贸易的危机可以通过打破“现时东方和西方的僵局”而获得解决。解决这僵局的关键在于英国与苏联签订一个大规模的长期贸易协定。备忘录指出：签订这样的协定可以减少日益严重的失业现象，保证长期的销路，并有助于维持世界和平。
    今年九月到中国访问的英中友协访问团团员炳恩，返国后在“雷诺新闻”发表一篇文章，评论对中国贸易的巨大可能性。他指出：英国和中国的贸易现在仅及过去的五分之一。如果不是因为英国政府奉行美国的禁运政策，正蓬勃建设中的新中国是可以消纳许多英国工业产品并且供给英国以大量急需的物品的。英国苦于美元不足，而中国却是一个不需要用美元购买的国家。他指责禁运政策“对西方国家来说，未见其利，先见其害，失去了在中国的广大市场”。
    前工党政府贸易大臣威尔逊十月二十八日在伦敦发表意见，指责美国剥夺了英国的出口市场。他主张与苏联和人民民主国家发展贸易。
    前工党议员普里特在十一月八日伦敦一次集会上说：英国被禁止与八亿人民进行贸易，这样就失去了可靠的市场。他说：“英国现在正与德国和日本竞争，这两国都是由禁止英国与远东进行贸易的那些人物供给资金的。”
    【新华社十八日讯】巴黎“解放报”报道：十三日，法国国民议会经济委员会一致通过了下面这个决议：“经济委员会认为，为了法国经济的利益，尽量发展国际贸易至为重要；这种贸易是富裕、进步和相互了解的泉源，也是缓和国际紧张局势的先决条件。因此，它促请政府摆脱政治考虑，而运用
    一切可能办法，毫无例外地促进并发展和一切能够输出与输入的国家之间的贸易。”
    法国国民议会经济委员会的决议说明：美国限制东、西方贸易的专横政策，正遇到越来越大的反抗。
    【新华社十八日讯】英国保守党政府上台后，继续追随美国扩军备战和歧视对外贸易政策，现已使英国经济危机进一步加深。保守党政府曾鼓吹用加倍降低人民生活的所谓“超级节约”和所谓加强对外贸易的“输出运动”来解决困难，但是一年来事实证明：保守党这种办法并无成效。事实是英国出口继续减少，工业继续萎缩，失业继续增加，物价继续上涨，人民生活继续恶化。
    由于资本主义世界市场日益缩小，以及美国、日本和西德日益加剧地排挤着英国的利益，英国的出口今年以来不断缩小。今年英国出口第一季每月平均总值为二亿三千九百五十万英镑，第二季降至二亿一千二百一十万英镑，第三季再降到一亿九千一百六十万英镑。今年第三季出口额较去年第三季减少八千万英镑以上。虽然保守党政府已三次宣布削减入口，前后共达六亿英镑，但是今年头九个月贸易逆差仍达六亿五千六百七十万英镑。英国既然不能在对外贸易上赚得美元，就只得动用黄金美元储备来弥补国际支付的赤字。这样，英国黄金美元储备到今年九月底就只剩下了十六亿八千五百万美元，远低于英国财政部认为最低限度的安全储备二十亿美元。
    在生产方面，执行扩张军备计划的结果和贸易管制使和平工业不断减产，远超过军事生产所能抵销的程度。根据英国官方指数，英国工业总生产今年上半年比去年上半年降低了约百分之二点五，今年六月份比去年六月份降低了近百分之十。英国主要的民用和出口工业之一的纺织业，今年上半年比去年同时期生产减低了将近五分之一。
    民用及出口工业的缩减，造成失业人数的不断上升。自保守党政府去年十月登台以来，失业逐月增加，据英国官方的材料，今年五月份失业共达五十一万七千六百人，比去年十月增加了将近一倍。只是在英国政府被迫放宽了某些贸易限制之后，像纺织业这样部门的严重失业才有所减少。
    物价高涨是扩军备战和贸易缩减的另一个恶果。在政府大量削减食物津贴之下，食品涨价特别厉害。今年头六个月，英国物价平均上涨了百分之六，而工人工资同时期仅增加百分之二。一年来，即使按照英国劳工部的统计，生活费用也上涨了百分之十一。自十月五日起，英国政府再次削减食物平价补助，使每人每周用于购买配给食物的支出又增加了一个半先令。
