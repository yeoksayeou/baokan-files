Why Learning to Read Russian Professional Books Can Be Accelerated
Cao Jinghua, Director of the Russian Language and Literature Department, Peking University

There are fundamental differences between Qi Jianhua's rapid literacy method and rapid learning of professional Russian. Firstly, Chinese characters do not have the variations in number and case like Russian nouns, pronouns, adjectives, and numerals, or in tense, voice, and number like Russian verbs. For example, the Chinese pronoun "我" (wǒ, I/me) is applicable to all cases. To indicate the plural, one simply adds "们" (men) to indicate the plural, unlike Russian я, меня, мне, меня, мною (мной), обо мне, and мы, нас, нам, нас, нами, о нас, which have so many variations. Secondly, Qi Jianhua's rapid literacy method is designed for Chinese people who already understand spoken Chinese but simply don't know how to read the characters. They are only unfamiliar with the written form, while the meaning and pronunciation of the words are already familiar. Russian is different for us; the written form, pronunciation, and meaning are all new. We need to observe the form, listen to the sound, and remember the meaning.

Nevertheless, for university teachers of natural sciences and applied technologies, as well as general workers in natural sciences and applied technologies, learning Russian can be accelerated.

Why? Because: First, most workers in these fields are proficient in one or more Western European languages. They already have a good understanding of general Western language patterns and can use the comparative method to learn Russian. Second, the vocabulary commonly used in each natural science and applied technology specialty is extremely narrow and limited in number. It is very effective to focus on and master the necessary vocabulary within the scope of one's specialty in a very short period with a fighting spirit. Third, most of this professional vocabulary is of foreign origin. Although the letters may be slightly different, the spelling often resembles familiar words. It's like a remodeled old friend; at first glance, it looks a little unfamiliar, but the sound is that of an "old friend," a "familiar acquaintance." Fourth, the syntax of these professional books is the most simple, straightforward, and clear. There are no inverted sentences, no dialects, slang, or habitual expressions beyond grammar that cannot be found in dictionaries, and no vivid literary descriptions. Learning just a little basic grammar can solve the problem. Fifth, with a clear purpose and a definite task, focusing all energy on a breakthrough, attacking the "reading" aspect, one can achieve results in a short period. There is no need to divert energy to seek an all-around development of "speaking," "writing," "reading," and "listening," as that will likely result in failure across the board, achieving nothing. To absorb the extremely rich and valuable experience of the Soviet Union, master the science and technology of socialist society, improve one's professional level, and improve one's working methods to meet the great construction of the motherland, it is an urgent task for today's cultural, educational, and scientific workers to master reading Russian as an important weapon with a fighting spirit! We cannot sit and wait for others to translate materials for us to improve our work; we should overcome difficulties and take action ourselves!

Comrade Zhang Lin, who introduced the new Soviet shunting method, is blind. He uses a Soviet-made 75x blood test microscope to read Russian. He can only see one letter the size of a plate at a time. After reading several letters, he puts them together to form a word and then understands the meaning of the word. He is learning from Soviet experience under such difficult conditions. This spirit is worth learning from.

The scope of social science vocabulary and textual narration is different from natural science and applied technology, requiring more effort and time to master this weapon. Under the leadership of the Party, the accelerated Russian language learning program piloted by Peking University has been successful. This is the beginning of a major event in absorbing advanced Soviet experience and promoting the construction of the motherland. A more magnificent wave of accelerated Russian language learning will follow across the country.

    阅读俄文专业书籍的学习为什么可以速成
    北京大学俄罗斯语文学系主任  曹靖华
    祁建华的速成识字法和专业俄文速成的学习，基本上有不相同的地方。首先是汉字没有像俄文的名词、代名词、形容词、数词等在数、格上以及动词在时、位、数上等等的变化。比如汉字代名词的“我”字，是放诸各格而皆准的“我”，遇多数各格，也只加一个表示多数的“们”字即可，不像俄文的я，меня，мне，меня，мною（мной），обо    мне．以及мы’нас，нам，нас，нами，о    нас那么样变的多。其次，祁建华的速成识字法，是给已懂中国话而只是不识汉字的中国人学的，他们只是不认识字形，而字义字音已经是熟的。俄文对我们来说就不同了，字形、字音、字义全是生的，需要观其形，听其声，记其义。
    虽然如此，对于教自然科学及应用技术的大学教师以及一般自然科学、应用技术方面的工作者来说，俄文并非是不能速成的。
    为什么呢？因为：第一，这方面的工作者，绝大多数都通晓西欧一种或一种以上的语文。西语的一般规律，他已成竹在胸，可以用比较法来学俄语。第二，自然科学和应用技术每一专业所常用之词汇范围极为窄狭，为数不多，在极短期间用战斗精神来突击本专业范围内所必须数量之语汇，极易收效。第三，这类专业语汇大部分又都是外来语，字母虽稍有不同，拼出来却都是熟词，这就像改装的老朋友，初看来有点面生，但闻其声却是“老朋友”、“旧相识”。第四，这类专业书籍的句法最朴素、最单纯、最明白，既无倒装句，又无词典上查不出的方言、俚语以及语法以外的习惯用语，更无形象的绘声绘影的文艺描写，只学一点简单语法就可解决问题。第五，目的明确，任务肯定，凝聚全部精力，采取重点突破，向“阅读”一点来攻击，短期定可收效。不必分散精力，希求“说”、“写”、“看”、“听”的全面发展，那结果恐将面面落空，一无所获。吸取苏联极丰富而宝贵的经验，掌握社会主义社会的科学、技术，提高自己的业务水平，改进自己的工作方法，来迎接祖国的伟大建设，以战斗精神，掌握阅读俄文的这一重要武器，这是今日文教及科学工作者刻不容缓的事！不能坐待别人替自己翻译材料，来改进自己的工作，我们应该突破困难，亲自动手！
    介绍苏联新调车法的张林同志，双目已失明，他用苏联制七十五倍的验血显微镜来读俄文。他一次只能看见盘子大的一个字母，待看完几个字母，再拼成一个单词，才明白这个词的意思。他是在这样困难的条件下学习苏联经验的。这种精神值得我们学习。
    社会科学词汇的范围以及文字叙述，就不同于自然科学及应用技术，需要付出更多的精力与时间，才能掌握这一武器。在党的领导下，北京大学试办的俄语速成学习是成功的。这是吸取苏联先进经验，促进祖国建设的一件大事的开端。更壮阔的俄语速成学习的浪涛，将在全国继之而起。
