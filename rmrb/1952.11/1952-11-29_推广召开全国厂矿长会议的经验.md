Promoting the Experience of Convening a National Conference of Factory and Mine Directors

After the Central Financial and Economic Commission convened a basic construction conference, all industrial and transportation departments adopted various methods to implement Comrade Chen Yun's important instructions on basic construction. From the 17th to the 20th of this month, the Ministry of Heavy Industry of the Central People's Government convened a national conference of factory and mine directors to mobilize and discuss. The conference was very fruitful. The participants all recognized the importance of basic construction work and were determined to actively transfer and train cadres after returning to their units to do a good job in basic construction. Facts have proved that convening factory and mine director conferences and deploying work is a good working method.

What are the benefits of the Ministry of Heavy Industry's National Conference of Factory and Mine Directors? First, this type of conference allows the responsible persons of the central leading organs to meet directly with the leaders of factories and mines, and explain the policies in person, so that the central policies can be accurately implemented in all factories and mines. In terms of time, it is faster than holding meetings at each level to convey the information or convening meetings by the professional bureaus. More importantly, it avoids the problem of instructions being conveyed vaguely or incompletely due to transmission through multiple layers. The report of the Ministry of Heavy Industry, based on its specific situation, concretized the central instructions, so that all leading cadres of factories and mines (including administrative and Party cadres) recognized in a short period of four days the policy of placing basic construction in a primary position, the importance and complexity of basic construction, how to do a good job in basic construction, and established a correct attitude towards basic construction. Some people had thoughts of neglecting basic construction, reliance, and departmentalism before the meeting. But at the meeting, they all made relatively profound self-criticisms. This unified everyone's understanding of basic construction, and the effect was very significant. It can enable factories and mines to avoid many mistakes in future work due to deviations in understanding.

Secondly, those attending the National Conference of Factory and Mine Directors of the Ministry of Heavy Industry included not only the leaders of many units responsible for basic construction tasks, but also the leaders of units that do not undertake basic construction tasks; not only the cadres responsible for leading basic construction, but also the cadres leading production. Leaders of units without construction tasks and cadres leading production had more or less local viewpoints before the meeting, believing that basic construction had nothing to do with them and were unwilling to transfer cadres to the basic construction departments. However, after participating in this meeting, their horizons were broadened, and they all criticized their local viewpoints and established an overall concept. They are not only determined to transfer and train cadres for the basic construction departments, but also confident in doing a good job in production. This has removed ideological obstacles for transferring cadres from production departments in the future.

Finally, the meeting not only enabled the leading cadres of factories and mines to have a correct understanding of basic construction, but also, during the meeting, formulated specific plans to implement the instructions of the Financial and Economic Commission of the Government Administration Council based on their own circumstances, such as strengthening institutions, transferring cadres, and training reserves. Most of these plans are correct. Therefore, after returning to the factories and mines, they can immediately take action to quickly put the plans into practice, avoiding official correspondence and wasting time. This is of great significance for seizing the time to prepare for next year's basic construction work.

It should be pointed out that although this meeting was very fruitful and the factory and mine leaders attending the meeting understood the spirit of the instructions of the Financial and Economic Commission of the Government Administration Council, there will still be obstacles from some erroneous ideas when implementing the instructions among all personnel in the factories and mines. Leading cadres of factories and mines must conduct education among all employees and cadres, explain the principles clearly, and resolutely implement the instructions of the Financial and Economic Commission of the Government Administration Council in the factories and mines.

### 推广召开全国厂矿长会议的经验

    推广召开全国厂矿长会议的经验
    中央财政经济委员会召开基本建设会议以后，各工业和交通部门都采取了各种办法，把陈云同志关于基本建设的重要指示贯彻下去。中央人民政府重工业部于本月十七日到二十日，召开了全国厂矿长会议，进行动员和讨论。这次会议的收获很大，与会的人都认识了基本建设工作的重要性，并下定决心回去后一定积极抽调和培养干部，做好基本建设工作。事实证明：召开厂矿长会议、布置工作，是一个良好的工作方法。
    重工业部全国厂矿长会议有什么好处呢？首先是这种会议使中央领导机关的负责人直接和厂矿企业的领导人见面，当面交代政策，因而能够准确地把中央的政策贯彻到所有的厂矿企业中去。在时间上，它比逐级召开会议传达或由专业局召集会议传达来得快。尤其重要的，是它避免了因层层传达而可能把指示传达得模糊不清或不完整的毛病。重工业部的报告根据自己的具体情况，把中央的指示具体化了，使所有的厂矿的领导干部（包括行政的和党的干部），在短短的四天内，都认识了必须把基本建设放在首要地位的方针，认识了基本建设的重要性和复杂性，认识了如何才能做好基本建设工作，树立了正确的对待基本建设的态度。有些人在开会前还有忽视基本建设工作的思想、依赖思想和本位主义思想。但这次在会上都作了比较深刻的自我批判。这就统一了大家对基本建设的认识，收到的效果是很显著的。它可以使各厂矿在今后工作中避免许多由于认识的偏差而发生的错误。
    其次，出席重工业部全国厂矿长会议的，不只是担负基本建设任务的许多单位的领导人，而且也有不担负基本建设任务的单位的领导人；不只是负责领导基本建设的干部，而且还有领导生产的干部。没有建设任务的单位的领导人和领导生产的干部，在会议前都有或多或少的局部观点，认为基本建设与自己无关，不肯向基本建设部门输送干部。但参加这次会议以后，视野扩大了，都批判了自己的局部观点，树立了整体观念。他们不但有决心为基本建设部门输送和培养干部，并且有信心搞好生产。这就给今后从生产部门抽调干部扫除了思想障碍。
    最后，会议不仅使厂矿领导干部对基本建设有了正确的认识，并且在会议期间，根据自己的情况，制订了具体贯彻政务院财政经济委员会指示的计划，如加强机构、抽调干部以及培养后备力量等的计划。这些计划大都是正确的。因此，他们回到厂矿以后，马上就可以行动起来，把计划迅速付诸实现，免去公文来往，浪费时间。这对于争取时间做好明年的基本建设准备工作，是有极大意义的。
    应当指出，尽管这次会议的收获很大，出席会议的厂矿领导人领会了政务院财政经济委员会指示的精神，但在厂矿全体人员中贯彻指示时也还会遇到若干错误思想的障碍的。厂矿领导干部必须在全体职工和干部中进行教育，讲清道理，把政务院财政经济委员会的指示坚决地贯彻到厂矿中去。
