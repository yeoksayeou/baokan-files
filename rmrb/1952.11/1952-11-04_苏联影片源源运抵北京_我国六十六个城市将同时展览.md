Xinhua News Agency, 3rd: To participate in the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month" Soviet film exhibition, the film "copies" and publicity materials, totaling more than 20 tons, are being rushed from Moscow to Beijing by special planes of the Sino-Soviet Civil Aviation Company and the Soviet State Civil Aviation Company. As of the afternoon of the 3rd, about 70% of the color film "copies" had arrived in Beijing, and are being distributed by the China Film Distribution and Exhibition Corporation to various cities holding film exhibitions.

The Soviet Film Export Corporation and the Moscow Film Studio have made their greatest efforts to supply these film "copies." The Soviet Film Studio completed its original task in more than 40 days, and also printed more than 1,500 "copies" for export to China. The Northeast and Shanghai Film Studios in our country, after intense crash work, also completed the translation task ahead of schedule, and completely transported all the translated materials of "Chinese dialogue" to Moscow before September 25.

At the same time, in addition to the projection teams of the Chinese People's Liberation Army carrying out activities during the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month," about 1,000 projection teams have been mobilized in various places to prepare to show Soviet films in factories and rural areas.
