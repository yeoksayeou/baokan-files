　　Xinhua News Agency, Northwest Black River Front, Vietnam, November 24th: The Vietnamese People's Army troops victoriously entered Son La City, the capital of Son La Province, more than 200 kilometers west of Hanoi, on November 22nd.

　　Xinhua News Agency, November 25th: According to foreign news agency reports, the French High Command in Vietnam admitted on the 23rd that Son La City, the largest stronghold of the French army in the Tai ethnic group area in northwestern Vietnam, had been captured by the Vietnamese People's Army.

　　The French High Command in Vietnam was still boasting on the 21st that it would do its best to defend this important strategic base. To this end, in addition to sending aircraft to indiscriminately bomb, they also used air transport with planes every fifteen minutes to transport supplies to Na San Airport, fifteen miles south of Son La, to supply the French troops on the Son La front; but these measures did not prevent the fall of Son La.

　　United Press International revealed the embarrassing situation of the French army before the fall of Son La, saying: Two days after the Vietnamese People's Army captured Moc Chau, a French outpost in Son La, the French High Command still did not know the whereabouts of the French garrison in the area. The Vietnamese People's Army advanced thirty-five miles in forty-eight hours with amazing speed.

    越南人民军解放西北部重要据点山萝城
    【新华社二十五日讯】越南通讯社越南西北部黑水江前线二十四日讯：越南人民军部队已于十一月二十二日胜利开入了距河内西方二百多公里的山萝省省会山萝城。
    【新华社二十五日讯】据外国通讯社消息：侵越法军总司令部二十三日承认法军在越南西北部泰族聚居地区的最大据点山萝城，已被越南人民军攻陷。
    侵越法军总司令部在二十一日还吹嘘要全力防守这个重要的战略基地。为此，他们除了派遣飞机滥肆轰炸外，并以每十五分钟一班飞机的空运，输送供应品到山萝以南十五英里的那岑机场，接济山萝前线的法军部队；但这些措施并未能防止山萝的陷落。
    合众社透露山萝陷落前法军的狼狈情况说：在越南人民军攻下山萝前哨法军据点木州后两天，法军总司令部还不知道该地法国驻军的消息。越南人民军以惊人的速度，在四十八小时内推进了三十五英里。
