Xinhua News Agency, November 27th: TASS, New York - The General Debate of the Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly on the Korean question concluded on November 24th. The various proposals will be discussed and voted on afterwards, including the Soviet proposal, the US proposal, the Indian proposal, the Mexican proposal and the Peruvian proposal.

    The representatives of the Soviet Union, Ukraine, Poland, Czechoslovakia and Byelorussia, during the general debate, exposed the attempt by the US ruling clique to force the United Nations to adopt a proposal endorsing the continuation of the Korean War.

    Therefore, the leaders of the US-British bloc are using behind-the-scenes trickery in an attempt to disguise their proposals, because the aggressive essence of these proposals has been exposed nakedly before the people of the world. American newspapers are daily publishing news about behind-the-scenes negotiations between American and British representatives and other delegations.

    Following these negotiations, the representatives of Mexico, Peru and India respectively submitted their proposals to the Political Committee. The drafters of the proposals all said that their proposals were "compromise" proposals, claiming that they put forward these proposals out of a desire to reach an "agreement" on a ceasefire in Korea.

    Speaking at the meeting on November 24th, the head of the Soviet delegation, Vyshinsky, analyzed the objections raised by the representatives of the US-British bloc to the Soviet proposals in previous meetings of the Political Committee. He proved that these objections were completely untenable, and emphasized that the leaders of the US-British bloc are attempting, under the banner of the Indian, Mexican and Peruvian proposals, to have the committee pass the original US demands: supporting the attitude of the US military command in Korea, approving the barbaric atrocities of the US military against Korean and Chinese prisoners of war, and agreeing to the continuation of US aggression in Korea.

    Vyshinsky finally analyzed the Indian proposal and proved that this proposal was close to the US proposals. He said that although the American newspapers published many ulterior motives messages, hypocritically "criticizing" the Indian proposal, there is no doubt that the American representatives will support the proposal of the Indian delegation at this meeting.

    Vyshinsky's words were confirmed by the speech delivered by US Secretary of State Acheson at the end of the meeting. Acheson said that he welcomed the Indian proposal with gratitude and expressed his gratitude to the proposers of the Indian proposal. He said that he was deeply convinced that, in fact, they all had the same goal and were working for the same goal.

    Acheson made an insignificant amendment to the Indian proposal and pointed out some unclear points in the Indian proposal. At the same time, Acheson pointed out that the Indian proposal repeated the important provisions in the US proposal on the repatriation of prisoners of war. Acheson also emphasized that, generally speaking, the Indian proposal directly pointed out the main and fundamental point, that is, the principle of not detaining or repatriating prisoners of war by force. Acheson also said that the US delegation welcomed any proposal that affirmed this basic principle and therefore had accepted the proposal put forward by the Indian government.

    Everyone knows that the fabrication of "forced repatriation" is to cover up the fact that the US prisoner-of-war camps forcibly detain Korean and Chinese prisoners of war. Therefore, Acheson frankly stated why the US ruling clique liked the Indian proposal.

    Acheson also acknowledged that the proposal of the Indian delegation was connected to other proposals, namely, the three proposals put forward by the US, Mexican and Peruvian delegations.

    The US Secretary of State avoided answering the speeches made by the head of the Soviet delegation, Vyshinsky, at the meeting on November 24th and at previous meetings, on the pretext that he had no intention of participating in legal debates. Acheson felt it was better to remain silent on the many facts exposing the United States' shameless violation of the recognized principles and norms of international law, and the many facts proving that the US ruling clique and the US military command in Korea had committed despicable crimes of maltreating Korean and Chinese prisoners of war.

    This time, the US representatives still failed to offer any reasons to oppose the substance of the Soviet proposal. Regarding the extremely important suggestion made by the Soviet delegation to implement a ceasefire in Korea, Acheson dismissed the issue with empty words, saying only that the ceasefire issue could not be resolved without resolving the issue of repatriating prisoners of war. However, everyone knows that the Soviet proposal actually talked about an immediate and complete ceasefire in accordance with the draft armistice agreement already agreed to by the belligerent parties, that is, to cease all land, sea, and air hostilities, and to hand over the issue of repatriating all prisoners of war to the committee for the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue established by the Soviet proposal, in which all issues should be decided by a two-thirds majority vote. Neither the US, Indian, Peruvian, or Mexican proposals suggested an immediate ceasefire, and Acheson did not mention a word about this irrefutable fact.

    The representatives of Syria and Afghanistan also spoke at the meeting of the Political Committee on November 24th. The Syrian representative spoke in detail about the "tragic situation" in Korea. He said that the Korean incident might develop into another world war. The Syrian representative stated that the most effective measures must be taken to end the Korean War, and advocated that the General Assembly should only adopt proposals that are acceptable to both parties. However, he expressed support for the Indian proposal at the end of his speech. The Afghan representative also expressed support for the Indian proposal.
Xinhua News Agency, November 27th: TASS, New York - It was previously reported that the Iranian representative said on November 24th that he supported the proposal of the Indian delegation and suggested that this proposal should be discussed and voted on first.

    At the meeting of the Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly on November 25th, the head of the Soviet delegation, Vyshinsky, spoke first. He said that the Soviet delegation firmly advocated that the various proposals should be discussed and voted on in accordance with the necessary procedures and in the order in which they were submitted.

    Vyshinsky said: "We firmly advocate that our proposal should be voted on first, and then the Indian proposal, because our proposal was submitted before the proposal of the Indian delegation. Taking another decision would seriously infringe upon our rights. We firmly oppose such illegal actions, especially when discussing and making decisions on such important suggestions contained in the Soviet proposal on the Korean issue."

    Vyshinsky's speech apparently caused confusion among the representatives of the US-British bloc. The speech of the New Zealand representative reflected this. The New Zealand representative admitted that there was no reason to violate the procedural rules, and that the Iranian representative's suggestion to prioritize the discussion of the Indian proposal was not in accordance with the procedural rules. The New Zealand representative pointed out that, as seen from the Soviet delegation's proposal, the issue of prioritizing discussion was a matter of substantive nature. Therefore, he suggested that the Political Committee adjourn until November 26th, saying that this was to allow time to analyze the issue. In accordance with the procedural rules, the New Zealand representative's motion was put to a vote by the chairman without discussion. The New Zealand motion was passed with forty-five votes; the Soviet Union, Ukraine, Byelorussia, Poland and Czechoslovakia voted against it. Three delegations abstained.

    Thus, the attempt to prioritize the discussion of the Indian proposal with the consent of the British and American delegations failed. There is no doubt that the US and British representatives will exercise their usual tactics to put pressure on other delegations to support the illegal suggestion of discussing and voting on the Indian proposal first.

### 联大政委会结束关于朝鲜问题一般辩论  维辛斯基揭露美国继续侵朝阴谋  指出美英集团企图在印度提案掩饰下设法通过美国的要求

    联大政委会结束关于朝鲜问题一般辩论
    维辛斯基揭露美国继续侵朝阴谋
    指出美英集团企图在印度提案掩饰下设法通过美国的要求
    【新华社二十七日讯】塔斯社纽约讯：联合国大会政治委员会关于朝鲜问题的一般辩论，已于十一月二十四日结束。以后将讨论各项提案，并表决苏联提案、美国提案、印度提案、墨西哥提案以及秘鲁提案。
    苏联、乌克兰、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克和白俄罗斯代表，在一般辩论中揭露了美国统治集团企图强使联合国通过一项赞同继续进行朝鲜战争的提案。
    因此，美英集团的首脑们就用幕后玩弄诡计的办法，企图竭力来伪装他们的建议，因为这种建议的侵略实质已在全世界人民面前赤裸裸地暴露出来了。美国报纸天天都刊载美国和英国代表和其他代表团在幕后进行谈判的消息。
    经过这种谈判之后，墨西哥、秘鲁和印度三国代表团就各自向政治委员会提出了它们的提案，提案的起草人都说他们的提案是“折衷”提案，自称他们提出这些提案是出于一种设法使朝鲜停战达成“协议”的愿望。
    苏联代表团团长维辛斯基在十一月二十四日会议上发言时，分析了美英集团的代表在政治委员会历次会议上对苏联建议提出的反对意见。他证明这些反对意见完全不能成立，并且着重指出：美英集团的首脑们，正企图在印度、墨西哥和秘鲁提案的旗帜下，设法使委员会通过美国原先那些要求：支持美军司令部在朝鲜的态度，批准美军对朝中战俘的野蛮暴行，并同意美国继续在朝鲜进行侵略。
    维辛斯基最后分析了印度提案，并且证明这个提案是与美国建议接近的。他说：虽然美国报纸登载了许多别有用心的消息，假惺惺地“批评”印度提案，可是毫无疑问，美国代表在这次会议上就会支持印度代表团的提案。
    维辛斯基这句话，在美国国务卿艾奇逊在会议结束时发表的演说中得到了证实。艾奇逊说：他以感激的心情欢迎印度的提案，并且对印度提案的提案人表示感谢。他说：他深信，事实上他们都抱着同一目标，并为同一目标而努力。
    艾奇逊对印度提案提出了一个无关大体的修正，并且指出印度提案中有些不大清楚的地方。同时，艾奇逊又指出，印度提案重复了美国关于遣返战俘的建议中的重要规定。艾奇逊还特别着重指出：总的说来，印度提案直截了当地指出了主要而基本的一点，那就是不得用武力来扣留或遣返战俘的原则。艾奇逊又说：美国代表团欢迎任何肯定这个基本原则的建议，因此已接受印度政府提出的提案。
    大家都知道，捏造出“强迫遣返”这种说法，是为了掩盖美国战俘营强迫扣留朝中战俘的事实。因此，艾奇逊就坦白地说出了美国统治集团为什么喜欢印度的提案。
    艾奇逊也承认，印度代表团的提案，是与其他提案，就是美国、墨西哥和秘鲁代表团提出的三个提案，一脉相通的。
    美国国务卿避不答复苏联代表团团长维辛斯基在十一月二十四日会议上以及在以前会议上的发言，藉口说他无意参加法律的辩论。对于许多暴露美国无耻地违反国际法的公认原则和准则的事实，以及许多证明美国统治集团和朝鲜美军司令部犯有虐待朝中战俘的可鄙罪行的事实，艾奇逊觉得还是闭口不谈为妙。
    美国代表这一次仍无法对苏联提案的实质提出任何反对的理由。关于苏联代表团要求朝鲜停火这个极其重要的建议，艾奇逊用空话撇开了这个问题，他只是说：不解决遣返战俘问题，停火问题就无法解决。可是，大家都知道，苏联的提案实际上谈到的是按照交战双方已经同意的停战协定草案，立即完全停火，就是说停止一切陆、海、空敌对行动，并把遣返全部战俘问题交给苏联提案所规定成立的和平解决朝鲜问题委员会去解决，在这个委员会中，一切问题要经三分之二的多数赞成决定。不论是美国、印度、秘鲁或墨西哥的提案，都没有建议立即停火，对于这个无可辩驳的事实，艾奇逊也一字未提。
    叙利亚和阿富汗两国代表也在十一月二十四日的政治委员会会议上发言。叙利亚代表在发言中详尽地谈到朝鲜的“悲惨情况”。他说：朝鲜事件可能发展成为另一次世界大战。叙利亚代表表示：必须采取最有效的终止朝鲜战争的措施，并主张大会只能通过能为双方所接受的提案。然而，他在发言结束时却表示赞成印度提案。阿富汗代表也表示支持印度提案。
    【新华社二十七日讯】塔斯社纽约讯：前已报道，伊朗代表十一月二十四日曾说他支持印度代表团的提案，并建议首先讨论与表决这个提案。
    在十一月二十五日联合国大会政治委员会会议上，苏联代表团团长维辛斯基首先发言。他说，苏联代表团坚决主张，按照必要的程序，根据提案提出的先后次序来讨论与表决各项提案。
    维辛斯基说：“我们坚决主张先表决我们的提案，然后再表决印度的提案，因为我们的提案是在印度代表团提案提出之前提出的。采取另外的决定，就会严重侵犯我们的权利。我们坚决反对这种非法行动，特别是反对在对苏联关于朝鲜问题提案所包含的这样重大的建议进行讨论和通过决定的时候采取这种非法行动。”
    维辛斯基的发言显然在美英集团的代表中引起了混乱。新西兰代表的发言反映了这一点。新西兰代表承认，没有理由违反程序规则，伊朗代表建议优先讨论印度提案是不合程序规则的。新西兰代表指出，关于优先讨论的问题，照苏联代表团的提法来看，是具有实质问题的性质的。因此，他建议政治委员会休会到十一月二十六日再开，他说，这是为了有时间来分析一下这个问题。按照程序规则，新西兰代表的动议未经讨论，即由主席交付表决。新西兰的动议以四十五票获得通过；苏联、乌克兰、白俄罗斯、波兰与捷克斯洛伐克五国投票反对。三个代表团弃权。
    这样，在英国及美国代表团同意下想使印度的提案优先讨论的企图失败了。毫无疑问，美国及英国代表将行使他们的惯技，对其他代表团施以压力，要他们支持先讨论与表决印度提案的非法建议。
