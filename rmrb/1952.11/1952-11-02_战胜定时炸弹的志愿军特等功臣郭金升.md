    Honor to Him, Meeting Chairman Mao
    American time bombs were placed on the roads and railways of Korea. They attempted to prevent the Volunteer Army and the People's Army transportation departments from delivering ammunition and supplies to the front lines in a timely manner.
    Brave men emerged, risking their lives to pull time bombs off the roads and railways, dragging them to the rivers and rice paddies, letting them explode in the water and in the fields. However, some exploded while being dragged.
    Brave men sacrificed themselves, and more brave men emerged. Comrade Guo Jinsheng was one of them. He calmly faced the time bombs that could explode at any moment, unscrewing them and disarming them. The time bombs became pieces of scrap metal. One, two, one type, two types, forty-five different styles, six hundred and ninety-three time bombs and landmines, one by one, fell from his hands.
    The lines were smoothly repaired, and the trains sped by.
    Honor belongs to Comrade Guo Jinsheng. He became a special-class hero of the Volunteer Army, and he was awarded the First-Class Warrior Honor Medal of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. The Volunteer Army sent him to Beijing to participate in the National Day celebrations, and he even met Chairman Mao.
    Now, when he talks about the situation at the time, a happy smile like a child appears on his face, which is covered with wrinkles from hard work. He happily said, "Chairman Mao toasted with us, Chairman Mao asked us how we were!" He suddenly closed his mouth. After a long pause, he continued: I couldn't sleep well all night after coming back, tossing and turning, thinking about how much I wanted to tell Chairman Mao!
    A Brave Man
    His thoughts returned to the front, back to the Korean battlefield. It was in February of this year, the snow had not melted, and the lines were still covered with white snow. Every day from morning, American planes bombed in shifts. The white snow turned black, and the fractured steel rails were overturned to one side, which was heartbreaking to see. One day, Guo Jinsheng and his squad were rushing to repair the lines—no matter what, the train had to leave tonight. They discovered a time bomb, yellow-green in color, as tall as a person and as thick as an armful, squatting there like a calf, trying to block our repair work. Guo Jinsheng was the first to run over and hold down one end of the time bomb. Everyone in the squad ran over and tied that end with electrical wire. They pulled from the front, and Guo Jinsheng pushed from behind. Step by step, they dragged the time bomb off the railway and into the rice paddy. The bomb could explode any minute; the bravest man was dragging the time bomb. The wind made the wires squeak. Guo Jinsheng pushed from behind, unable to exert his strength, and it became heavier and heavier. He encouraged everyone: "Comrades, American planes, who knows how many Korean women and children have been injured by the bombing again. Let's quickly repair the lines so that the brothers at the front can beat them hard!" "Right," the young men shouted, and the time bomb was pulled quickly and dropped into the rice paddy. The second one also lay there firmly.
    "This method is too clumsy!" Guo Jinsheng pondered. He made up his mind: "I have to find a way to deal with it!"
    He couldn't sleep well that night. When he closed his eyes, he saw that yellow-green thing, like a vicious wolf, blocking the way. Several of our good comrades sacrificed themselves; the line could not be repaired for a while, and the ammunition could not be transported up... He couldn't think further, and he couldn't lie still, so he quietly got up. Walking outside, his foot touched a pile of screws, and he was still thinking:
    "No matter how powerful your time bomb is, it's always installed by someone; if it can be installed, it can be disassembled. I don't believe I can't disassemble you." He picked up a screw at random and turned it easily. He thought again that a time bomb wouldn't be as simple as a screw, it would explode when the time came, probably with a spring. He struggled to recall how the spring-loaded plug was installed. He thought and struggled like this all night without closing his eyes.
    The next day the planes came to bomb again, and they repaired the lines all day.
    The third day the planes didn't come, and the lines were repaired. The leadership allowed everyone to rest. But Guo Jinsheng kept thinking about trying to disarm the time bomb. "Living people can't be controlled by dead things!"
    Guo Jinsheng went straight to the site.
    Disarming the First Time Bomb
    Guo Jinsheng went straight to the site. He carried a spirit of intrepid courage and determination, just like six years ago, when he got out of his sickbed and went straight to the People's Liberation Army with a small bag; also like when he was wounded twice in the suppression of bandits and didn't leave the front lines, carrying five captured rifles, one machine gun, and one pistol, taking one step and spitting out a mouthful of blood, running all the way back to the troops. In those times, he had linked his fate with the People's Liberation Army, with the Communist Party, and with his own government. When it was necessary for him to use his life to protect them, he unhesitatingly gave himself. This was also the reason why he went back to work in the coal mine after being wounded. When the coal shed collapsed, he rescued the electric slide at the risk of his life, and was wounded for the third time; this was also the reason why he repeatedly requested to join the anti-American, aid-Korea railway worker team. When he was repairing the Yalu River Bridge, he didn't leave the site for four days and four nights. After crossing the river, he risked his life four times to rescue the hit locomotives, trains, and sleeping cars, using his body to put out the burning rice. This thirty-seven-year-old railway worker from a mining background emerged from death time after time for the sake of the motherland and the Party!
    Now, he rushed to the scene with the same belief.
    The time bomb was still buried gloomily in the rice paddy. He looked at it carefully. There was a screw cap on it, maybe it could be unscrewed, he hesitated a bit. In an instant, the story that the political commissar had told him a few days ago about the martyr Lin Xiangqian, who sacrificed in the "February 7th" strike, flashed in his mind. Did the previous generation of martyrs waver in the face of the enemy for the liberation and happiness of the working class? No. Can I, Guo Jinsheng, retreat in the face of a time bomb? He thought of various methods and overcame many difficulties, finally opening the screw cap and taking out the detonator. Now, the time bomb was like a disarmed prisoner, drooping its head and lying in the field. He disarmed another one using the same method. He happily thought as he returned with the two detonators: Two devils have been eliminated. The next day he boldly disarmed another eight.

    Among Five Hundred Bombs
    The higher authorities encouraged and supported him, approving him to specialize in clearing time bombs. He patrolled back and forth on several hundred kilometers of lines. Wherever time bombs were discovered, he went there.
    Time bombs were not of the same type, and the explosion times were also different, ranging from one hour to half a year. Danger followed him at all times; relying on courage and wisdom, he overcame it step by step.
    In a continuous battle lasting three days and three nights, he disarmed five hundred bombs alone.
    One morning in mid-May, enemy planes bombed a certain vital passage to the front in shifts. A narrow area three kilometers long and half a kilometer wide was filled with bomb craters, time bombs, and landmines.
    A little after seven o'clock, Guo Jinsheng arrived at the scene by car. He discovered that four time bombs and wind-activated bombs had also landed in the yard of a Korean villager's house next to the highway. A pair of lovely boys and girls had been sacrificed. The mother was holding the youngest child and crying bitterly. The children's father was still at the front. Guo Jinsheng, who never shed tears, couldn't help but shed tears. He secretly made up his mind: I will not leave the scene until these bombs are cleared. Walking out of this house, he roughly estimated along the line that there were about five or six hundred bombs on both sides of this three-kilometer-long line. There were time bombs as tall as a person and as thick as an armful, landmines like mousetraps, and even mother-son bombs like watermelons and mushroom-shaped wind-activated bombs with caps. As soon as his hand touched a landmine, it exploded with a bang, and his hand was injured. The driver who brought him advised him to go back, but he firmly refused. He bandaged himself with a first-aid kit in one hand, while asking the driver to find a wire on the road and make him a hook. He ran to a place fifty meters away from the landmine, aimed accurately, and hooked it lightly with the wire. The landmine exploded. Amidst the sound of the explosion, he disarmed and detonated at the same time. Time bombs that had reached their time limit were whistling. He didn't let his comrades come forward. He thought: If there has to be a sacrifice, let me be the only one to sacrifice. He loudly told the leaders who came to see him: "I won't die today, I will fight it; if I sacrifice, the Party just has to remember me."
    The meal delivery man came. He picked up the steamed bun, but his hand hurt terribly and he couldn't eat it. He felt sad again when he thought of the sacrificed Korean children, so he put down the bun and went to deal with the bombs again. At night, the bright moonlight shone brightly, and the workers repairing the lines echoed him from afar. He didn't know he was hungry or sleepy, and he ran back and forth on the lines alone. The train passed that night. He couldn't help but laugh happily as he listened to the loud sound of the whistle. He knew that boxes of ammunition were being transported to the front, and even more powerful firepower was being fired at the American army positions.
    In eliminating more than five hundred bombs, he did not leave the scene for three days and three nights. He ran selflessly among the exploding bombs, unscrewing screws and pulling the fuse. In three days, his arms were completely swollen, and his injured chest was also swollen. When he disposed of the last time bomb and walked shakily onto the ambulance, he was already half-conscious. He only had time to ask one question: "Did the planes come again today?" before he passed out.
    Our Volunteer Army's transportation line heroes are the ones who persisted in the anti-bombing struggle and achieved victory on the transportation front like this.
    Working for the Children
    The American robbers' dream of threatening the lines with time bombs was bankrupt. No matter what kind of "modernized" weapons the enemy had, they became scrap metal in front of our Volunteer Army. Comrade Guo Jinsheng not only cleared time bombs and avoided huge losses for the motherland; he also used the shells of time bombs to repair bridges, make carpentry tools, and extracted more than 21 tons of explosives from the time bombs to blast mountain rocks and prepare a large amount of roadbed stones for flood control.
    When the Volunteer Army first went abroad, our transportation was relatively difficult. Our Volunteer Army had to "eat roasted noodles and drink snow." Now, the situation has completely changed. The strengthening of our air defense forces and the dispatch of the People's Volunteer Air Force, as well as the blood and sweat of thousands of railway workers, guarantee that the steel transportation line delivers large quantities of grain, weapons, ammunition, supplies, and spiritual and cultural food to the front day and night.
    Don't imagine that such a fearless hero is a special, unfeeling person. On the contrary, he loves life and is very kind. He struggled to read me a letter of condolence sent to him by a twelve-year-old girl in China; he also cared about an old lady in her fifties or sixties, who told him that she was rushing to sew winter clothes for the Volunteer Army; an old lady in her seventies told him in a letter of condolence that she was taking care of her daughter-in-law's children so that her daughter-in-law could attend a literacy class. When talking about these things, he was always very kind, talking about them like his own family, revealing a very deep affection. It was these feelings that made him resolutely, bravely, and selflessly eliminate the enemy. When talking about children, he seemed even more lively, gesturing happily and talking about how the "Young Pioneers" surrounded him, affectionately calling him uncle, and asking him to tell stories about heroic models. "I would rather clear a thousand more bombs myself and take a thousand more risks," he said thoughtfully, slowly and powerfully: "As long as our children grow up and never encounter a bomb again in their lives." If he has any personal happiness to hope for, this is the greatest happiness he hopes for!

    战胜定时炸弹的志愿军特等功臣郭金升
    金凤
    荣誉归于他，来见毛主席
    美国的定时炸弹落在朝鲜的公路上、线路上。它企图阻挡志愿军和人民军运输部门把弹药、给养及时送到前线去。
    勇敢的人出来了，冒着生命的危险，从公路上、从线路上拉起定时炸弹，拉到江里去，拉到稻田里去；让它在水里爆炸，在田野里爆炸。但是，也间或有正在拉的时候爆炸了的。
    勇敢的人牺牲了，更多的勇敢的人出来了。我们的郭金升同志便是其中的一个。他镇静地面对着随时会爆炸的定时弹，拧开它、拆卸它。定时弹变成了一块块废铁。一个、两个、一种、两种、四十五种不同式样、六百九十三颗定时炸弹，地雷弹，一个一个地从他手里落下。
    线路顺利地修复着，火车飞驰着。
    荣誉归于郭金升同志。他成为了志愿军的特等功臣，他获得了朝鲜民主主义人民共和国一级战士荣誉勋章。志愿军派他到北京参加国庆节观礼，他还见到了毛主席。
    现在，当他谈起当时的情景时，他那满布着辛苦皱纹的脸上便现出孩子一样幸福的笑容。他高高兴兴地说：“毛主席和我们碰杯，毛主席问我们好哩！”他突然闭住了嘴。停了好一会，他才接着说：回来一夜没有好睡，翻过来翻过去，自己有多少话要告诉毛主席啊！
    勇敢的人
    他的思想回到了前方，回到朝鲜战场上。那是在今年的二月，积雪没有溶化，线路还被白雪覆盖着。每日从早晨起，美国飞机轮番来轰炸。白雪变黑了，炸裂的钢轨掀在一边，看着真叫人伤心。有一天，郭金升和他的小队，赶着抢修线路—无论如何，今天夜里火车要开出去。他们发现定时炸弹了，黄绿的颜色，有一人高、一抱粗，像一头小牛似的恶狠狠蹲在那里，想阻挡我们的抢修。郭金升第一个跑了过去，捺住了定时弹的一头。小队的人全跑了过来，用电线拴住那一头。他们在前面拉，郭金升在后面推。一步步，他们拉着定时弹往线路以外的稻田移去。炸弹每一分钟都可能爆炸，最勇敢的人，拉着定时炸弹。风吹着电线吱吱的响，郭金升在后面推着，使不上劲，愈推愈重，他鼓动着大家：“同志们，美国飞机，这一忽不知又炸伤了多少朝鲜的妇女和儿童，咱们赶紧修好线路，让前方弟兄们狠狠地揍他们！”“对”，小伙子们发一声喊，定时弹拉得飞快，落到稻田里去。第二颗也死死地躺到那里。
    “这办法太笨哪！”郭金升琢磨着，他下了决心：“要想出办法来治它！”
    这一宿，他没有好睡。闭上眼，他就看到那黄绿黄绿的家伙，像个恶狼，挡在道上。我们的几个好同志牺牲了；线路一时修不好，弹药运不上去……他想不下去，也躺不住了，悄悄爬了起来。走到外面，他的脚碰到一堆螺丝，他心里还在捉摸着：
    “管你定时弹多厉害，总是人装的；能装就能卸，不信我就卸不下你。”他随手拾起一颗螺丝，一拧就拧动了；又一想，定时弹不会像螺丝那么简单，它到时候会爆炸，大概按得有弹簧。他又苦苦回想起带弹簧的插鞘是怎么装置的。就这么寻思，折腾了一夜，没有闭一闭眼睛。
    第二天飞机又来轰炸，他们又抢修了一天。
    第三天飞机没有来，线路也修好了，领导上让大家休息一下。郭金升却一直想着要试一试去卸那个定时炸弹。“活人不能被死东西治了！”
    郭金升直奔向现场去。
    拆卸第一颗定时炸弹
    郭金升直奔向现场。他带着无畏的勇气和决心，就像六年以前，他从病床上起来，背着小行李直奔解放军一样；也像他在剿匪中两次负伤不下火线，背着缴获的五支步枪，一挺机枪和一支手枪，走一步路咯一口血，一路跑回部队一样。在那些时候，他就把自己的命运和解放军、和共产党、和自己的政权联在一起。当需要他用自己的生命来保护它们的时候，他毫不犹疑地献出自己。这也就是他伤后重新到煤矿工作，当煤屋倒塌时候，他奋不顾身抢救电溜子，第三次负伤的原因；这也是他再三要求参加抗美援朝铁路职工大队的原因。他在抢修鸭绿江桥的时候，曾四天四夜不下现场；过江以后，四次舍身抢救被打中的机车、列车和宿营车，用自己的身体去扑灭燃烧着的大米。这个矿工出身的三十七岁的铁路工人，一次又一次从死亡里闯出来，为了祖国、为了党！
    现在，他抱着这同样的信念奔向现场。
    定时炸弹还是阴沉沉地埋在稻田里。他仔细看了一下，上面有着螺丝盖，也许可以拧，他有些迟疑。一刹那，几天前政治委员和他讲的“二七”罢工牺牲的烈士林祥谦的故事在他脑中闪过。为了工人阶级的解放和幸福，前一辈的烈士在敌人面前动摇过吗？没有。我郭金升在定时炸弹面前，难道能退缩吗？他想了各种办法，克服了许多困难，终于打开了螺丝盖，取出了引火管。现在，定时炸弹就像一个解除了武装的俘虏，垂头丧气地倒在田野里了。用同样的办法，他卸了另外一颗。拿着这两颗引火管回来，他高高兴兴地想着：已经消灭了两个鬼子。第二天他放胆又卸了八个。
    在五百颗炸弹中
    上级鼓励和支持着他，批准他专门做清除定时炸弹的工作。在几百公里的线路上，他来回巡查着，那里发现定时炸弹他就去那里。
    定时炸弹不是一个式样，爆炸的时间也不同，从一个钟头到半年爆炸的都有。危险随时跟随着他；靠勇气也靠智慧，他一步步战胜了它。
    在一次三天三夜的连续战斗中，他一个人卸除了五百颗炸弹。
    五月中的一个清晨，敌机在通往前方的某要道轮番轰炸，三公里长，半华里宽的狭长地区，布满了弹坑、定时炸弹和地雷弹。
    七点多钟，郭金升坐车赶到了现场，他发现在公路旁的一家朝鲜老乡的院子里，也落了四个定时炸弹和风力弹，一对可爱的男女孩子牺牲了，母亲怀抱着最小的孩子痛哭，孩子的父亲还在前方。从来也不流泪的郭金升禁不住流泪了。他暗暗下了决心：不清除掉这些炸弹不下现场。从这家走出去，他沿着线路粗粗估计一下，在这三里长的线路两旁大约有五六百颗炸弹。有一人高一抱粗的定时炸弹，有像老鼠夹子一样的地雷弹，更有像西瓜一样的母子弹和菌形带盖的风力弹。当他的手刚一碰上一颗地雷弹，蹦的一声，地雷弹爆炸了，他的手受了伤。送他来的司机劝他回去，他坚决不肯，一手用救急包包扎着自己，一面请司机在道上找根铁丝做了根钩子给他。他跑到离地雷弹五十公尺远的地方，看准了，用铁丝轻轻一钩，地雷炸了。在爆炸的响声中，他一面拆卸，一面炸。到了时间的定时炸弹呼呼的在响。他不让同志们上前，他想：要牺牲，让我一个人牺牲好了。他大声告诉来看他的首长：“今天我死不了，就要和它斗争；要是牺牲了，党记住我就是了。”
    送饭的来了，他拿起馒头，手格格的疼，吃不下去，想起牺牲的朝鲜孩子又心酸，他把馒头撩下又去处理炸弹了。晚上，大月亮地照得挺亮，抢修线路的工人远远和他一起呼应。他不知道饿也不知道困，一个人在线路上跑来跑去。火车当晚就通行了。他听着汽笛的响亮的吼叫，他禁不住高高兴兴笑起来。他知道一箱箱的弹药正运向前方，更强大的火力在向美军阵地发射着。
    在消除五百多颗炸弹中，三天三夜他没有离开现场。他忘我地在爆炸着的炸弹中间奔跑着，旋开螺丝，拉着火线。三天，他的胳膊完全肿了，受过伤的胸部也发肿起来。当他处理掉最后一颗定时弹，摇摇幌幌走上救护车时，他已经是半昏迷了。他只来得及问一句：“飞机今天又来过没有？”就昏倒了过去。
    我们的志愿军运输线上的英雄，就是这样坚持反轰炸的斗争，取得运输战线上的胜利的。
    为孩子们工作
    美国强盗用定时炸弹威胁线路的梦想破产了。不管敌人什么样的“近代化”武器，在我们志愿军面前都成了废铁。郭金升同志不仅清除定时炸弹为祖国避免了大量损失；他还利用定时炸弹的弹壳修理桥梁，做木工用具，取出定时炸弹的炸药二十一吨多，用来炸崩山石，准备好防洪的大量垫路基石。
    志愿军初出国时，我们的运输还比较困难。我们的志愿军不得不“一把炒面一口雪”。现在，情况完全改变了。我们防空力量的加强和人民志愿空军的出动，还有千千万万铁路工人的血汗，保证了钢铁运输线日夜运送着大量的粮食、武器、弹药、给养和精神文化食粮上前线去。
    不要想像这样一个不怕死的英雄是一个特殊的无情的人。正相反，他是这样热爱生活、这样慈祥。他曾经给我吃力地念过一个国内十二岁的小女孩子寄给他的慰问信；他也牵挂着一位五六十岁的老太太，她告诉他正在为志愿军赶缝冬装；一位七十多岁老大娘在慰问信里告诉他，她给儿媳看孩子，让儿媳去上速成识字班。谈起这些来，他总是非常亲切地，像谈着他自己的家人一样，流露出十分深厚的感情。也就是这些感情，使他坚决勇敢地、奋不顾身地去消灭敌人。谈到孩子，他显得更活泼了，兴高采烈地，用手比划着，讲着“红领巾们”怎么包围着他，亲热地喊他叔叔，要他讲英雄模范事迹。“我宁可自己再清除一千个炸弹，冒一千次危险，”他沉思着、缓慢而有力地说：“只要我们这些孩子长大起来，一辈子不要再碰到一个炸弹。”如果说他还有什么个人幸福的想望，这就是他想望的最大的幸福！
