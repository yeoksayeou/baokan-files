The World Transformed
Drawn by Ye Qianyu
    Big Tree: "Since China's liberation, everything has changed. I'm used as a railroad tie, and you're smelted into steel rails. In less than three years, look how many railways we've built!"
    Iron Ore Mountain: "Exactly! In the past, the Kuomintang reactionaries specialized in 'taking wealth locally,' searching the pockets of the common people everywhere. Now, the Communist Party 'takes materials locally.' We were buried for who knows how many years, and today we've finally turned over!"
