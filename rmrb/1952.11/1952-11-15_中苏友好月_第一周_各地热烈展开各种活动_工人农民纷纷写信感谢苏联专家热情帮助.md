    First Week of "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month"
    Various Activities Launched Enthusiastically Across the Country
    Workers and Peasants Write Letters Thanking Soviet Experts for Their Warm Assistance
    [Reported by this newspaper] The people of the whole country joyfully spent the first week of the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month." Since the 7th, people from all walks of life in various places have held celebration meetings, symposiums, report meetings, and recreational evenings to celebrate the 35th anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution and launch activities for the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month." The streets in various places were filled with colorful flags, and slogans celebrating the 35th anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution and Sino-Soviet friendship could be seen everywhere. People across the country were rejoicing in the brilliant achievements of Soviet socialist and communist construction and for the happier tomorrow of their own motherland.

    The arrival of several Soviet cultural and artistic groups has added extra color to the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month" activities in the capital. People from all walks of life in the capital welcomed the Soviet friends with unparalleled enthusiasm. Many students and factory workers learned to sing Russian songs such as "Moscow-Beijing" in three or four days to welcome the Soviet friends. The Soviet Cultural Workers Delegation, the Soviet Art Troupe, the Soviet Army Red Flag Song and Dance Ensemble, and the Soviet Film Artists Delegation were warmly welcomed everywhere. Many people gave their treasured possessions as gifts to their Soviet friends. Workers from the Beijing Branch of the Tianjin Railway Administration said after watching the Soviet Army Red Flag Song and Dance Ensemble perform the "Grand Military Dance": "Watching the 'Grand Military Dance' has further strengthened our determination to defend peace!" Regarding the performances and activities of the famous Soviet artists, Li Jinquan, a national model worker and worker at the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, said: "The Soviet elder brother is not only helping us in production and construction, but also inspiring and helping us in art and science. We should work harder and advance together with the Soviet elder brother!" Li Jinquan pledged to thank the Soviet friends with practical actions by completing the November production task ten days ahead of schedule. Many people who heard the reports by Tikhonov, Beloshapko, Grusenko, Yefimov, Chulaki, B.A. Alexandrov, and Fedorov felt they had gained enormously. Some units have already begun to discuss and study in conjunction with their own work.

    The employees of factories and enterprises in various cities are intensifying production and learning from advanced Soviet experience as a gift to the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month." Workers at the Shijingshan Power Plant in the capital, due to further implementing the advanced Soviet experience of burning low-value coal, saved the state approximately 421 million yuan in wealth in the first ten days of November. Since the Changxindian Railway Factory began to promote the Zhendarova work method on the 7th, by the 11th, the sand molding and water pouring groups in the factory's foundry had doubled their work efficiency. After the Beijing People's Machinery Factory promoted the high-speed cutting method, the number of revolutions per minute of the lathe increased from 300 to 730; previously, it was impossible to make one automobile model pressure ring in an hour, but now it is possible to make ten in an hour. The finished product workshop of the Dalian Petroleum Factory decided to complete the annual unloading task by the 20th of this month, and to complete the task of increasing production and saving 20,000 tons of grain wealth. The cracking workshop of the factory put forward a "Learn One Thing from the Soviet Union" campaign within the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month." The Dihua City Construction Company, which has achieved remarkable results in promoting the advanced Soviet bricklaying method, plans to train 200 workers of various ethnic groups this winter to learn the advanced Soviet bricklaying method, so that it can be widely promoted throughout the city next year. After the start of "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month," the mechanical fitter workshop of a certain factory in the Xinjiang Military Region used the "high-speed cutting method" to create a new record of 1,200 revolutions per minute.

    In order to thank the Soviet experts and advanced Soviet producers for their warm help, industrial model workers and workers in various places have written letters to Soviet friends to express their gratitude. Chinese employees of the Sino-Soviet Shipbuilding Company in Dalian and Lushun wrote more than 270 letters to Soviet experts in five days. Tian Guiying, the first female train driver in New China, said in a letter to Lisov, the former Soviet section chief of the Dalian Locomotive Depot of the China Changchun Railway: "During the 'Sino-Soviet Friendship Month,' I especially felt the deep friendship between China and the Soviet Union. I often think of you, under the guidance of Comrade Stalin, spending so much effort to train us, a group of girls, into glorious female train drivers. In order to enable us to quickly master the technology, you often did not go home after work, sacrificing your rest time to teach us. When we had something we did not understand, you patiently explained it three or four times in a row. Thanks to your enthusiastic help, coupled with our hard work, in eight months and twenty days, we learned the technology of driving locomotives." Many workers' letters also expressed their determination to continue to work hard to learn from advanced Soviet experience. The entire staff of the Changchun Engineering Section of the China Changchun Railway wrote in a letter to Soviet expert Nefedov: "Since our engineering section learned your advanced road maintenance method, the quality of the line has increased by 9.3 times, and the speed of trains has increased from 80 kilometers to 100 kilometers. In the past year or so, we have increased production and saved more than 500 million yuan of wealth for the country. In the future, the entire staff of our engineering section is determined to continue to learn from your advanced experience, in order to further improve the quality of the line and ensure that there will be no accidents this year, to consolidate our unbreakable friendship." Peasants on both sides of the Huai River, young technical cadres and office workers of the Huai River Harnessing Committee, and workers participating in the Huai River harnessing also wrote letters to Soviet water conservancy expert Bukov to thank him for his sincere and selfless help to the Chinese people's water conservancy construction. Chen Shouxian, a peasant in Huoqiu County, Anhui Province, and a model worker in harnessing the Huai River, said in a letter to Bukov: "We along the Huai River suffered from floods for many years before liberation, and the people's lives and production were not guaranteed at all. Since Chairman Mao proposed to thoroughly harness the Huai River, you have come to help us repair the Runheji Diversion Sluice. The 400,000 mu of land here has reaped bumper harvests for two consecutive years, and the people's lives have become prosperous. You have helped our country's construction and freed us from many years of suffering. This is something we will never forget."

    Students in various places also wrote letters to Soviet friends, congratulating them on their happy lives and expressing their determination to learn from the Soviet people. One hundred and forty-five students from eleven ethnic groups including Tibetan, Han, Hui, Qiang, Yi, Miao, Zhuang, and Buyi in the second class of the political department of the Southwest Nationalities Institute wrote to the farmers in Sagen, Soviet Union, to congratulate them on the 35th anniversary of the October Socialist Revolution, and expressed their determination to learn from their spirit of studying science, overcoming difficulties, and transforming nature to build their hometowns. Young Pioneers and other children from the Second Girls' School in Xinjiang Province also wrote letters to the Young Pioneers in the Soviet Union, congratulating them on their happy lives.

    Workers, peasants, youth representatives, scientific workers, students, and others who have visited the Soviet Union held report meetings in various places to introduce the situation in the Soviet Union and carry out Sino-Soviet friendship propaganda. Scientific and technical workers in Wuhan organized to widely publicize the achievements of the Soviet Union in science and technology throughout the city. In the first half of the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month," in addition to broadcasting on the radio, they also held lectures and symposiums in six places including the Wuhan Cultural Center and the Workers' Cultural Palace. In the second half of the month, they went deep into factories, neighborhoods, and suburbs to give lectures to the general public. It is estimated that they will give 200 lectures during the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month." The Wuhan Branch of the Chinese Medical Association also held a "Introduction to Soviet Medicine" lecture. In Xi'an City, since the 7th, the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month" lecture group, workers and youth representatives who had visited the Soviet Union, as well as literary and art workers and more than 2,400 residents' reading groups in the city, were all mobilized to carry out propaganda to the masses in the urban area. In the fifth district of Jin County, Northeast China, a single district organized more than 500 propaganda cadres to report the great significance of Sino-Soviet friendship to the peasants.

    Soviet film exhibitions and Soviet photo exhibitions in various places have been enthusiastically welcomed by the masses. In the 67 cities across the country holding film exhibitions, the movie theaters were crowded with people all day long. Some cinemas in Xi'an City have sold out the tickets for the last day of the film exhibition—December 6. As of the 12th, the 12 cinemas in the capital have screened 350 shows, with an audience of more than 248,000 people. The 34 film projection teams organized by the Beijing "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month" Office have also launched activities in the streets and rural suburbs since the 7th. As of the 13th, they have screened 362 shows, with an audience of approximately 400,000 people. As of the 12th, the Soviet photo exhibition has been visited by more than 22,000 people.

    各地热烈展开各种活动
    工人农民纷纷写信感谢苏联专家热情帮助
    【本报讯】全国人民愉快地度过了“中苏友好月”第一周。从七日起，各地各界人民都举行了庆祝会、座谈会、报告会和游艺晚会等，庆祝伟大的十月社会主义革命三十五周年，展开“中苏友好月”活动。各地街头挂满了彩色的旗帜，到处可以看到庆祝伟大的十月社会主义革命三十五周年和中苏友好标语。各地人民都为苏联社会主义、共产主义建设的光辉成就和自己祖国更幸福的明天而欢欣鼓舞。
    苏联文化艺术界的几个团体的到来，使首都“中苏友好月”的活动分外生色。首都各界人民都以无比的热情欢迎苏联友人。许多学校学生和工厂工人，为了欢迎苏联友人，在三、四天内就学会了唱俄文的“莫斯科——北京”等歌曲。苏联文化工作者代表团、苏联艺术工作团、苏军红旗歌舞团和苏联电影艺术工作者代表团到处受到热烈欢迎。许多人都以自己珍爱的东西作为礼物送给苏联朋友们。天津铁路管理局北京分局的工人们，看了苏军红旗歌舞团表演“大军舞”后，纷纷表示说：“看了‘大军舞’，进一步增强了我们保卫和平的决心！”对于苏联著名艺术家的演出和活动，全国劳动模范、石景山钢铁厂工人李金泉说：“苏联老大哥不但在生产建设方面帮助我们，还在艺术科学方面启发、帮助我们。我们应该加倍努力，和苏联老大哥一起前进！”李金泉保证以提早十天完成十一月份生产任务的实际行动，来感谢苏联朋友们。许多听到吉洪诺夫、别洛沙普柯、格鲁森科、叶菲莫夫、楚拉基、鲍·亚·亚历山大罗夫、费道罗夫的报告的人，都感到有莫大的收获。有些单位已开始结合着自己的业务进行讨论和学习。
    各城市工厂企业的职工，正以加紧生产和学习苏联先进经验，作为对“中苏友好月”的献礼。首都石景山发电厂的工人，由于进一步贯彻烧低值煤的苏联先进经验，在十一月第一旬即替国家节省了约等于四亿二千一百万元的财富。长辛店铁路工厂自七日开始推广镇达罗娃的工作方法后，到十一日该厂翻砂场翻砂、倒水两组已提高工作效率一倍。北京人民机器厂推广高速切削法后，车床每分钟的旋转次数，已由三百次增加至七百三十次；以前做汽车模型压圈，一小时不能做一个，现在一小时能做十个了。大连石油工厂成品车间决定在本月二十日完成全年卸油任务，并完成增产节约两万吨粮食财富的任务。该厂裂化车间提出了在“中苏友好月”内展开“向苏联学习一件事”运动。推行苏联先进砌砖法获得显著成绩的迪化市建筑公司，准备在今年冬天培养二百个各族工人，学习苏联先进砌砖法，以便明年在全市普遍推广。新疆军区某厂机械钳工间，在“中苏友好月”开始以后，运用“高速切削法”已创造一分钟一千二百周的新纪录。
    为了感谢苏联专家和苏联先进生产者的热情帮助，各地工业劳动模范和工人们，纷纷写信给苏联友人致谢。旅大市中苏造船公司中国职工在五天内就给苏联专家写了二百七十多封信。新中国第一个火车女司机田桂英在写给前中长铁路大连机务段苏联段长李索夫的信上说：“在‘中苏友好月’中，我特别感受到中苏两国间的深厚友谊。我时常会想起在斯大林同志教导下的你，曾花费了多少心血把我们一群女孩子培养成光荣的女火车司机。你为了使我们很快地掌握技术，下班后常常不回家，牺牲休息的时间来教导我们。我们有不懂的地方，你就耐心地连续讲解三、四次。由于你热心的帮助，加上我们努力学习，在八个月零二十天的时间里，我们就学会了驾驶机车的技术。”许多工人的信中，还表达了他们继续努力学习苏联先进经验的决心。中长铁路长春工务段工区全体职工给苏联专家聂菲铎夫的信中说：“我们工区从学习了您的先进养路法以后，线路质量提高了九点三倍，行车速度由八十公里提高到一百公里，一年多来已为国家增产节约了五亿多元的财富。今后，我们全工区职工决心继续学习您的先进经验，以进一步提高线路质量、保证今年不出一切事故的实际行动，来巩固我们牢不可破的友谊。”淮河两岸农民和治淮委员会青年技术干部、机关工作者以及参加治淮的工人们，也纷纷写信给苏联水利专家布可夫，感谢他对中国人民水利建设事业赤忱无私的帮助。安徽省霍邱县农民、治淮劳动模范陈寿先给布可夫的信上说：“我们沿淮一带在解放前连年闹水灾，人民生活和生产没有一点保障。自从毛主席提出根治淮河后，你来帮助我们修好了润河集分水闸，我们这里四十万亩土地一连获得了两年的丰收，人民生活都富裕了。你帮助我们祖国建设，使我们摆脱了多少年来的苦难，这是我们永远难忘的。”
    各地学生等也纷纷写信给苏联友人，祝贺他们的幸福生活，表示向苏联人民学习的决心。西南民族学院政治科第二班藏、汉、回、羌、彝、苗、僮、补伊等十一个民族的一百四十五个学生，写信给苏联萨根的农民，祝贺十月社会主义革命三十五周年，并表示决心学习他们研究科学、克服困难、改造大自然的精神，来建设自己的家乡。新疆省立第二女子学校的少年儿童队员等也纷纷给苏联的少先队员写信，祝贺苏联儿童的幸福生活。
    曾经访问过苏联的工人、农民、青年代表和科学工作者、学生等分别在各地举行报告会，介绍苏联情况，展开中苏友好宣传。武汉市科学技术工作者组织起来，在全市广泛宣传苏联在科学和技术上的成就。“中苏友好月”前半月中，他们除在广播电台播讲外，并在武汉市文化馆、工人文化宫等六处举办讲座和座谈会，后半月就深入到工厂、里弄和郊区向广大人民作讲演。预计他们在“中苏友好月”中的讲演可达二百次。中华医学会武汉分会也举办了“苏联医学介绍”讲座。西安市从七日起，“中苏友好月”讲演团，曾经访问过苏联的工人、青年代表们，以及全市的文艺工作者和二千四百多个居民读报组，全部出动，向市区群众进行宣传。东北金县第五区一个区就组织了五百多名宣传干部，向农民报告中苏友好的伟大意义。
    各地苏联影片展览和苏联图片展览，更受到了广大群众的热烈欢迎。全国举行影片展览的六十七个城市电影院门前整日挤得人山人海。西安市有的电影院已售完了影片展览最后一天——十二月六日的座券。到十二日止，首都十二家影院已放映三百五十场，观众达二十四万八千多人。北京市“中苏友好月”办公室所组织的三十四个电影放映队，自七日起也在街道及郊区农村中展开活动，到十三日止，已放映了三百六十二场，观众约四十万人。苏联图片展览，到十二日止，观众已达二万二千多人。
