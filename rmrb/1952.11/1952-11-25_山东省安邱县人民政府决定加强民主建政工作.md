Response to Readers' Criticisms and Suggestions in People's Daily:

    Anqiu County People's Government of Shandong Province Decides to Strengthen Democratic Governance
    Editor: The "Readers' Letters" column on September 13 published Comrade Ren Ting's criticism of our Anqiu County People's Government's lack of attention to democratic governance. We fully accept this criticism and are determined to correct our errors immediately.
    Since the fifth session of the people's representatives conference from all walks of life was held in mid-September last year, it was not until August 9 this year that the sixth session of the people's representatives conference from all walks of life was held. During these eleven months, the Civil Affairs Department of the Shandong Provincial People's Government and the Changwei Special District Office repeatedly urged us, but we still delayed holding the people's representatives conference from all walks of life under the pretext of being busy with work. This is an error of not implementing the instructions of higher authorities, not abiding by the basic national system, and neglecting the rights of the people. The main reason for this error is that the leading cadres of our county people's government did not deeply understand that the people's representative conference and the people's congress system are the basic systems of our country. We are accustomed to a few people taking care of everything and are not accustomed to discussing matters with the masses. We used the excuse of being busy with work to not convene the people's representative conference on schedule, but we did not understand that convening the people's representative conference is an important method to mobilize people from all walks of life in the county to do the current arduous work well.
    We are determined to correct this error. We have convened a county political affairs meeting to examine the idea of not paying attention to democratic governance and decided to organize relevant cadres to study important documents related to democratic governance to further strengthen democratic governance.  Anqiu County People's Government

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    山东省安邱县人民政府决定加强民主建政工作
    编辑同志：九月十三日“读者来信”栏刊载了韧挺同志批评我安邱县人民政府不重视民主建政工作的来信。我们完全接受这个批评，并决心立即改正错误。
    我县自去年九月中旬召开第五届各界人民代表会议之后，到今年八月九日才召开第六届各界人民代表会议。在这十一个月的过程中，山东省人民政府民政厅和昌潍专署曾多次督促，但我们仍藉口工作忙，拖延不召开各界人民代表会议。这是一种不执行上级指示、不遵守国家基本制度和忽视人民权利的错误。发生这种错误的主要原因是我们县人民政府的领导干部没有深刻认识人民代表会议与人民代表大会制度是我们国家的基本制度。我们习惯于少数人包办一切，不习惯有事和群众商量。我们藉口工作忙而不按期召开人民代表会议，却不了解召开人民代表会议正是发动全县各界人民来做好当前繁重的工作的一个重要方法。
    我们决心改正这个错误。我们已召开县的政务会议检查不重视民主建政的思想，并决定组织有关干部学习一次有关民主建政的重要文件，以便进一步加强民主建政工作。  安邱县人民政府
