Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 24th: From November 14th to 20th, our troops defending the left ridge of Shangganling annihilated more than 1,600 invading enemy troops. On the 15th, the enemy attempted to seize four positions on this ridge, using two battalions of troops, and launched continuous attacks up to fourteen times. The battle lasted from dawn until 2 PM. The enemy, after suffering more than 500 casualties and unable to attack further, retreated knowing the difficulty. In the following days, fighting continued around the main peak of the ridge, forming repeated battles for each position. Sometimes the enemy seized one or two positions, and our troops immediately counterattacked and retook them. So far, the main peak of the ridge and most of the surrounding positions are under our control. The enemy can only temporarily occupy three or four positions on the hillside or at the foot of the mountain. Our troops defending the right ridge of Shangganling launched a surprise attack on enemy positions on the evening of the 16th, destroying five bunkers and annihilating more than 20 enemies.

On the night of November 18th, a unit of our troops on the Western Front, with the coordination of powerful artillery fire and tanks, attacked Pingcun South Mountain, five kilometers north of Gaolangpu-ri. This battle took less than two hours, and completely annihilated the first company of the Black Watch Regiment of the 29th Brigade of the British accomplice army guarding the position. On the same night, they repelled eight enemy counterattacks, killing or wounding 328 British soldiers, and capturing eight light and heavy machine guns, and twenty-one submachine guns and rifles. This British unit originally belonged to the British Scottish Highland Brigade stationed in West Germany. It was transferred back to the British mainland in April this year, and in June it was transferred to Korea to replace the Leicester Regiment, which had suffered multiple blows. This was the first heavy price it paid for the Wall Street bosses' war profits.

Originally stationed in the Pingcun South Mountain area was the 7th Regiment of the 1st Division of the U.S. Marine Corps. In October, our troops launched three counterattacks on this mountain, killing or wounding more than 900 of them. Afterwards, Van Fleet withdrew it from the front line and replaced it with this substitute British unit.

In this week, our frontline artillery fire also killed and wounded more than 870 enemy troops and destroyed 14 enemy tanks. Our frontline anti-aircraft artillery shot down 27 enemy aircraft and damaged 22 enemy aircraft.

    朝中部队在上甘岭继续歼敌千余
    西线我军某部一夜歼灭英帮凶军三百余名
    前线炮火一周歼敌八百击落击伤敌机四十九架
    【新华社朝鲜前线二十四日电】从十一月十四日到二十日这一周中，扼守在上甘岭左边山岭上的我军，又歼灭进犯敌军一千六百多名。十五日敌人企图夺取这个山岭上的四个阵地，使用了两个营的兵力，连续进攻达十四次。战斗从黎明开始至下午二时结束，敌人在伤亡五百多人无力再攻后，才知难而退。以后的几天中，战斗仍在山岭主峰的四周进行，形成逐阵地的反覆的争夺战。有时敌人夺去一两处阵地，我军随即反击夺回。至今该山岭上的主峰以及周围大部阵地已为我军控制，敌人只能暂时占领山坡或山脚下的三、四个阵地。扼守在上甘岭右边山岭上的我军，在十六日黄昏曾出动袭击敌人阵地，炸毁五个地堡，歼敌二十多名。
    西线我军某部于十一月十八日夜，在强大的炮火与坦克配合下，攻击高浪浦里以北五公里的坪村南山。这次战斗不到两小时，就把守敌英国帮凶军二十九旅黑卫团第一连全部歼灭，并在当夜打退敌军八次反击，先后毙伤英军三百二十八名，缴获轻、重机枪八挺，冲锋枪、步枪二十一枝。这支英国部队原属驻在西德的英苏格兰高地旅，今年四月调回英国本土，六月里被调到朝鲜替换已经遭受多次打击的莱斯特团，这次是它为华尔街老板的战争利润付出的第一笔惨重代价。
    原在坪村南山一带的是美国侵略军海军陆战队第一师第七团。十月份我军曾向这座山头举行了三次反击，杀伤其九百多人，以后范佛里特便将它撤下火线，换上了这支替死的英国部队。
    在这一周中，我军前线炮火还击毙和击伤敌军八百七十多名，击毁敌军坦克十四辆。我军前线高射火器击落敌机二十七架，击伤敌机二十二架。
