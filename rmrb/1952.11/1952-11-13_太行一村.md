    Taihang Village
    By our reporter Tian Liu
    Between Army Day and National Day, I visited a rural village in Wuxiang County, Shanxi Province. Thinking about the arduous struggles of the old revolutionary base areas in the past, and looking at their happy lives today, one cannot help but feel particularly inspired.
    Wuxiang County in Shanxi Province was the central area of the Taihang Old Revolutionary Base during the Anti-Japanese War. In the early days of the war, Commander-in-Chief Zhu De and the headquarters of the Eighth Route Army were stationed here. In order to drive the Eighth Route Army out of the Taihang Mountains and destroy this command post for the North China Anti-Japanese War, the Japanese invaders used the most barbaric means – the “Three Alls Policy” of burning all, killing all, and looting all – to attack the heroic and unyielding people in this area. At that time, the struggle of the people here was familiar to and concerned about by all the people in North China and even all of China. Now, how are the farmers in the Taihang Mountains living? Have they healed the heavy wounds of war? In the great cause of building our beloved motherland, are they still standing at the forefront of the struggle as they did in the past?
    “Go to Yaoshangou Village.” Comrade Li Pengfei, Secretary of the Wuxiang County Party Committee, said to me: “You can find the best answers to your many questions there.”
    The First Household
    From the county Party committee to Yaoshangou Village, the sixty-li road wound around the mountainside and took a whole day to reach the destination at nightfall. In the dim light, the appearance of the village was no longer clear. Wang Laixiu, the branch propaganda committee member, led me into a household. This was the first household I saw in Yaoshangou, a very beautiful household: the house was beautiful, and the furnishings were beautiful. The kang (platform bed) was covered with a brand-new felt rug and a gorgeous woolen blanket. The bedding was made of brightly colored printed cloth. The kang enclosure was decorated with colored patterns. On the snow-white walls were pasted many picture newspapers. Liu Hulan, the good daughter of the Chinese people, with her proud head that will never bow, looked up and gazed into the distance. Below the huge portrait of Chairman Mao was a hanging with his inscription to the people of the old revolutionary base areas: “Carry forward the revolutionary tradition and strive for greater glory.” Opposite was a colorful landscape painting, with a couplet hanging on its sides: “Oppose wars of aggression, defend world peace.”
    What kind of household is this? While I was pondering, cheerful and hearty words came from the courtyard:
    “Who’s here? From Beijing?” A young woman wearing a sea-blue Shanghai cotton top and black wide-legged trousers walked in like a gust of wind. She shook hands with me generously and enthusiastically, saying repeatedly in the same cheerful and hearty voice: “You’ve come a long way, please sit down quickly.”
    “Hao Donglian, the chairman of the Women’s Federation,” Wang Laixiu, the branch propaganda committee member, introduced, “This is her home.”
    The chairman of the Women’s Federation is a shrewd and capable person. Tall, with a full head of black hair, and a pair of large eyes that shone in the dim light. How many things she cares about! First, she asked about the Korean armistice negotiations, then the construction of the capital, and also the production situation in various places.... I told her about the victory in Korea, the miracles of the capital in the summer, and the good growth of crops everywhere. She raised her head and laughed happily and heartily again. Seeing her like this, I immediately thought of the meaning of this couplet, “Oppose wars of aggression, defend world peace.” Even if it weren’t hanging here, one would naturally think of it. During the conversation, I learned that Hao Donglian is not only the chairman of the Women’s Federation, but also a member of the village branch committee and the vice-chairman of the agricultural production cooperative. “Are you too busy with so many jobs?” I asked her, “What about the production at home?”
    “I am a little busy, but I spend half of the year on work,” Donglian replied plainly, as if talking about something unrelated to herself:
    “If I miss a little work, the group does well, it will always make up for it.” She had just returned from Hougou – a natural village of Yaoshangou Village – after holding a women's meeting. During the summer hoeing period, each woman planned to cut five hundred catties of artemisia grass. Today, the meeting was held to check the results. The 135 women in the village had already cut an average of 620 catties per person. At this time, Wang Laixiu, the branch propaganda committee member, said: "Don't look at Donglian's busy work and missed work, her production is the best. She has cut one thousand catties of artemisia grass."
    Hao Donglian has a seven or eight-year-old daughter who studies at the village primary school. At this time, she came back from school. As soon as she entered the door, she rushed into her mother's arms, and two small arms hugged her mother's neck and said, "The teacher asked us to write big characters, buy me a brush...". When she found a stranger in the house, she burrowed into her mother's arms and refused to raise her head again. Soon, Donglian's husband, Zhang Wufu, also returned from the field. He is an honest farmer. After asking me where I came from and if the journey was hard, he went out again. After a while, he came in with a chopping board under his left arm and a shiny kitchen knife in his right hand. Donglian said, "You must be thirsty, eat a watermelon." Wuxiang County produces watermelons in every village, and this area is especially famous. Donglian said, "Now every family grows some, and every family picks sixty or seventy. Not to sell for money, just to quench their thirst when they come back from the fields hot."
    A beautiful house, beautiful furnishings, a daughter studying at school, and eating cool and sweet watermelon after work—what kind of life is this?
    The people of the old revolutionary base areas and the revolutionary cadres have endless fighting feelings. I met the homeowner for the first time, but we were like close friends who had reunited after a long separation. We talked about everything as soon as we met.
    It turned out that Hao Donglian's family was like this.
    Earlier, the family was very poor. Her father died early, and her mother cooked for the landlord and couldn’t support her four siblings. Two dan (石) of rice were used to sell her brother, and several dou (斗) of grain were used to sell her sister. Donglian followed her mother to take care of the landlord's children, and cooked when she got older. But life did not subdue this girl, but made her stronger. She would rather drink the dishwater when she was hungry and leave the rice for her mother to eat. Her whole body was as frozen as a red radish, and she would mend even a piece of torn cloth on her mother's torn clothes. Therefore, her mother wanted to sell her several times, but she couldn't bear to part with this good daughter; she wanted to marry this hardworking and beautiful daughter to a wealthy family several times, but she was rejected by this stubborn little girl. Finally, Donglian fell in love with Zhang Wufu, who was more than ten years older than her and grazed sheep for the landlord, and got married. This was the year of the "July 7th" Anti-Japanese War. Wufu had five brothers, all of whom were good men as strong as iron, and each was a “good laborer,” but they couldn’t even fill their own stomachs. His family had only two mu and three fen (亩分) of hillside land. One of the five brothers went down to the coal mine, two carried long-term work, one cultivated several mu of land for the landlord, and Wufu grazed sheep for the landlord. Throughout the year, the five brothers could only meet once on the thirtieth night of the twelfth lunar month. At that time, the brothers carried a mouth on their shoulders and an empty stomach in their hands, gathered in that broken kiln, dug up a few thorns from the barren mountains, gathered a fire, and sighed face to face until dawn. Then, they each returned to the "master's" place and worked like cattle and horses....
    "Let’s not talk about these disappointing things, those days will never come again!" Donglian shook her head and changed the subject: "Now my family has thirty-four mu of land, one cow, and harvested fifty-four dan of grain last year. This year, I joined the agricultural production cooperative and will earn at least seventy dan."
    A family of seven, earning seventy dan of grain, how could life not be good?
    Yaoshangou Village is not the only one where Hao Donglian's family lives such a prosperous life. I visited more than ten families in a row, and they were all like this. Now, there are 221 households in Yaoshangou Village. Wang Jinyun, the branch secretary, told me: More than half of the village – 127 households – have a surplus of 725 dan of grain; "There are only four poor peasant households in the whole village, and eight households are short of grain – one household is short of three months of grain, and the other seven are short of a month or so."
    "Why are there four poor peasant households, but eight households short of grain?"
    "Poor peasants have less land and farm tools than others, but their lives are not bad." Jinyun explained: "These eight grain-short households have special reasons. Take Zheng Guosheng's family as an example. They were doing well, but he had whimsical ideas and started speculative business last year, which resulted in losses and collapse."
    "Are there any rich peasants in the village?"
    "No," Jinyun replied: "There are no long-term workers hired in our village, no land rented out, everyone lives very well, and there are few loans. Even if some families are temporarily inconvenienced, the villagers don’t want interest." After a while, he added: "Right now, we are preparing to establish a credit cooperative to use people's surplus grain and money."
    In the early society, if one family became rich, many families would become poor. Now, in the new China, in Yaoshangou, that situation has been completely reversed. It is no longer one person rich and ten thousand people poor, but it can be said that ten thousand people are rich and no one is poor.
    Love and Marriage
    In Yaoshangou Village, not only has people's material life undergone fundamental changes, moving from poverty to prosperity, but people's spiritual life is also changing rapidly. The old ideas and customs left over from the old society are being replaced by new ideas and customs. In Yaoshangou, I saw a young couple in love, and I also met a newly married couple.
    The young couple in love are named Han Yinwang and Shi Ezi.
    Shi Ezi is eighteen years old, with slender eyebrows and big eyes, matched with her round face, she looks both beautiful and handsome. Her temperament is gentle and quiet, and she has never been anxious or blushed with anyone. Her labor is among the best in the village women: whether it is weeding, chasing green, or harvesting, she can pick it up and put it down. In the summer, when cutting artemisia grass and pressing green manure, the women's task was to cut 500 catties per person, and all 135 women in the village exceeded the task, but only eight people in the village cut more than 800 catties, and Shi Ezi was one of them.
    The young people in the village all love Shi Ezi, but she only loves a young man named Han Yinwang.
    Han Yinwang is a teacher at the village's civil school. This year, he joined the agricultural production cooperative. In his farming team, he was the first to start reading newspapers. Later, other farming teams learned to do this, but they couldn’t do as well as Han Yinwang's team. Han Yinwang is also the librarian of the village library. Every time Ezi went to borrow books, he always said to her: "There are new books again, this one is the most suitable for you." In this way, the two fell in love slowly in the library, in the civil school, and in the collective labor of the agricultural production cooperative. A few months later, the two asked to get engaged. But the difficulty also lies here. The taciturn Shi Ezi has not said a word to her parents about her love with Yinwang. Although today's marriages are decided by oneself, it is not good if the whole family is unhappy.
    "The two young people came to me." Wang Jinyun, the branch secretary, said when talking about this matter: "I looked at it and felt that the two were very suitable, so I helped them talk to Ezi's mother. Guess what Ezi's mother said?"
    "Her mother said: 'Free marriage is a good thing, as long as they are willing themselves, I, as a mother, have no objection. Since she asked me, I have to say something: Yinwang is also a good child, his appearance and character are good, but his labor is a little bit worse.' I said, Yinwang's labor is not bad! 'It's not bad,' Ezi's mother said: 'But he is not the best in the village like my Ezi! But that's what I said, as long as they are willing themselves, I have no objection, this is just a mother's heart...'"
    "She is really a good mother, she doesn't arrange marriages for her children, but she also fulfills her responsibilities as a mother." A few days later, I saw Shi Ezi's mother, and when I thought of what Wang Jinyun said that day, I said to her like this. Ezi's mother laughed, and she said: "Actually, I said that on purpose, Yinwang is a good child, and I just hate that he can't become something great, I'm just worrying about my children."
    "When are the two getting married?"
    "There is no date yet," she replied, and then smiled with satisfaction: "My opinion is effective, Yinwang has to wait until he becomes a labor model in the cooperative before getting married."
    I asked about their family life, and she said: "Last year, they harvested thirty dan of grain. This year, they joined the agricultural production cooperative. Her father said that the crops in the cooperative are growing well, and they can distribute at least forty dan."
    "With so much grain harvested, Ezi must make two beautiful dowries when she gets married."
    "I said the same! But you don't know our girl, she said: I don't want anything. Now, as long as someone comes up with a new idea, everyone is rushing to learn it." After a while, Ezi's mother said to me again: "These days, you are always with Huaiwang and the others, so you must know about him, and our girl is going to learn from him too."
    Who doesn’t know about Huaiwang? He has been praised by his superiors and published in newspapers. A young poet has also written a long poem for him.
    Huaiwang's surname is Han, a member of the Communist Youth League, and a youth labor model of the agricultural production cooperative. Their story took place in June this year.
    June is the wheat harvest season, and people are busy in the fields cutting wheat from morning till night. But Huaiwang went to the chairman of the agricultural production cooperative to ask for leave. The chairman of the cooperative is also the branch secretary, Wang Jinyun. In terms of rural customs, Huaiwang calls Jinyun his uncle!
    "Uncle, I'm asking for leave."
    "The busy wheat harvest, what are you asking leave for?" At that time, Jinyun was talking to a cadre from the county about the wheat harvest situation of the cooperative, and asked casually.
    "I'm going to the district," Huaiwang stated the reason: "I have something important."
    Asked again, he still said he had something important, but what important thing? He didn't say. If someone else asked for leave like this, they would not be granted it, but Huaiwang is different: from last year to now, in terms of labor and learning, he is the first in everything. Every time the patriotic agreement is checked on the patriotic day, he is a model, and his name is on the honor roll every time. Therefore, Huaiwang's unreasonable leave was exceptionally approved.
    In the evening, when people were about to finish work and go home, they suddenly saw Huaiwang coming back from the district excitedly. He was carrying a floral quilt on his shoulder and a small bag in his hand. The most striking thing was that a young girl in floral clothes was following behind Huaiwang.
    The villagers greeted Huaiwang from afar: "What are you carrying, Huaiwang—something for someone else?"
    "My own."
    It's strange, Huaiwang actually answered like this. His dark face was so happy that it was shining; the girl behind him just lowered her head, pursed her lips and smiled, her face as red as the sunset glow.
    Everyone understood at a glance: "Ha! Huaiwang is getting married."
    People swarmed up and surrounded Huaiwang and the girl in the center. This one joked with Huaiwang, that one made faces at Huaiwang; some snatched the floral quilt and looked at it back and forth; some snatched the small bag in his hand, only caring about pinching it hard, which made Huaiwang quickly shout:
    "Don't pinch, don't pinch, it's noodles."
    This girl is called Xianghua, and she is from Shanghe Village, two li to the north.
    In an instant, the news of Huaiwang's marriage spread throughout the village. As soon as Huaiwang and Xianghua arrived home, all the men and women in the village crowded into the courtyard. The chairman of the cooperative heard about it and rushed over.
    "You kid, what's so shy about this, you wouldn't say anything when you asked for leave." The chairman of the cooperative said, while separating the crowd with both hands and coming to the center, he asked the two of them: "What day are you getting married?"
    "Tonight."
    "Well—good, let's hold a wedding meeting." Jinyun said, "I'll be the chairman."
    The wedding ceremony began. This wedding ceremony did not worship heaven and earth, nor did it worship ghosts and gods, but only bowed to Chairman Mao; it did not ride horses or sedan chairs, nor did it have a grand banquet, and even the wedding quilt was brought by the bride's family. But I have never seen such a lively wedding, it seems that the whole village has moved to Huaiwang's house, laughing and joking, shouting and making a group, laughing into a ball. Whenever there is a meeting in the village, the young people are always talking and shouting in front, and the old people squat aside and puff on their pipes, but this time it is different.
    "This is good," the old men commented: "In the past, our poor people couldn't marry a wife, but now we can do it with two catties of noodles."
    The old women opened their toothless mouths and laughed.
    "It's a big event in a lifetime, so casually," Shi Da Niang, who is about to betroth her daughter, smiled for a while, but for some reason, her eyes were a little moist: "She didn't even ride in a sedan chair, she just walked here."
    "Don't say that, auntie," an old woman with almost white hair standing next to her said: "When we rode in sedan chairs in those days, we cried with eyes as big as copper bells, but look at these people walking here, they are smiling so much that they can't close their mouths."
    The "wedding meeting" became more and more lively, and people became more and more happy. The young people were the most enthusiastic, and they asked the most questions: "How did you two fall in love, teach us too", "Who said it first?"... Speaking, laughing, singing, and making noise, it was late at night, and Huaiwang's house was still as lively as a stage play.
    The next day, before the sun came out, the people of the farming team were already busy cutting wheat in the fields. The tense labor could not prevent people from discussing Huaiwang's happy event: "Is their marriage like the marriages of people in the early days, where no one is willing to sleep first on the first night, and they sit back-to-back all night?"
    "Ask Huaiwang," the quick-eyed person said: "Look, they are coming."
    Things are so novel now. Yesterday's wedding ceremony was unforgettable enough. On the second day of the wedding, the bride and groom went to the field to produce, which was even more unheard of. People didn't bother to ask what the scene was like on the wedding night, so they said:
    "Look at how fast they cut, if they cut slowly, it means they didn't sleep well last night."
    "Then Xianghua will be responsible..."
    The bride and groom did not answer. The two looked at each other and bent down. The sickle flew up, and after a while, Huaiwang cut to Dayong's front. Xianghua followed him closely. Everyone laughed, the sickle shone brightly, chasing after the newlyweds. (To be continued)

专栏：

    太行一村
    本报记者  田流
    在建军节和国庆节之间，我访问了山西武乡县一个农村。想想过去老根据地人民的艰苦斗争，看看他们今天的幸福生活，让人特别振奋。
    山西省武乡县是抗日战争时期太行老根据地的中心地区。抗战初期，朱总司令和八路军总部就驻在这里。日寇为了把八路军赶出太行山，摧毁这个指挥华北抗日战争的司令台，曾用最野蛮的手段——烧光、杀光、抢光的“三光政策”，进攻这一带英勇不屈的人民。那时候，这里的人民的斗争情况，是全华北以至全中国人民所熟悉和关心的。现在，太行山上的农民怎样生活着？他们是否已经医治好了那沉重的战争创伤？在建设我们亲爱祖国的伟大事业中，他们是不是还像过去一样，站在斗争的最前列？
    “到窑上沟村去吧。”中共武乡县委书记李鹏飞同志对我说：“你这许多问题，在那里都能找到最好的答案。”
    第一户人家
    从县委驻地到窑上沟村，在山腰间绕来绕去，六十里路走了一整天，掌灯时分才到达目的地。昏暗中已看不清村庄的面貌。支部宣传委员王来秀同志领我进入一户人家。这是我看到的窑上沟第一户人家，一户十分美好的人家：房子漂亮，陈设美观。炕上铺着崭新的毡子和华丽的羊毛毯。被褥都是鲜艳的花布作的。炕厢被彩色的图案画装饰着。雪白的墙壁上贴着好些画报，中国人民的好女儿——刘胡兰那永远不会低下去的骄傲的头，高高昂起遥望着远方。毛主席巨像的下面，挂着他亲笔写给革命老根据地人民的“发扬革命传统，争取更大光荣”的题字。迎面是一幅彩色山水画，它的左右挂着一幅对联：“反对侵略战争，保卫世界和平。”
    这是一户什么样的人家？正沉思间，院里传来快乐爽朗的话语：
    “谁们来啦？北京来的？”一个身穿海昌蓝上衣，下着黑色宽脚裤的青年妇女，一阵风似地走进来。她大方热情地同我握手，用同样快乐爽朗的声音不停地说着：“远路啦，快坐快坐。”
    “妇联主席郝冬莲”，支部宣传委员王来秀介绍说，“这就是她的家。”
    妇联主席是个精明强干的人。硕长的身材，满头黑发，一对大眼睛在昏暗的灯光中闪闪发光。她关心多少事情啊，先问朝鲜停战谈判，再问首都建设，还问各地生产情形……。我把朝鲜的胜利，首都夏天的奇迹，各地庄稼都长得很好的情形告诉她，她把头一扬，又快乐而爽朗地笑起来了。看到她这种情形，我立刻想到了这幅“反对侵略战争，保卫世界和平”的对联的意义了，即便它不挂在这里，也会很自然地想到它的。谈话中，知道郝冬莲不光是妇联主席，还是本村的支部委员和农业生产合作社的副社长。“担任这么多工作，忙得过来么？”我问她：“家里的生产怎么办呢？”
    “忙是忙些，算起来一年总有半年时间办工作。”冬莲平淡的回答，好像谈一件和自己无关的事情：
    “个人误点工，大伙作得好，总抵得过了。”她这是刚从后沟——窑上沟村的一个自然庄开罢妇女大会回来。夏锄期间，每个妇女计划割五百斤蒿草，今天开会检查成绩，全村一百三十五个妇女，平均每人已经割了六百二十斤。这时，支部宣传委员王来秀说：“别看冬莲工作忙、误工多，生产可是最好的，她已割了一千斤蒿草了。”
    郝冬莲有个七、八岁的女儿，在本村小学读书。这时放学回来了。一入门就扑到妈妈怀里，两条小膀臂搂着妈妈的脖子说：“老师叫我们写大字了，你给我买毛笔……”。及至发现还有一个陌生人在屋里，她使劲地钻到妈妈怀里，再不肯抬起头来。不久，冬莲的丈夫张五福也从田里回来了。他是一个老实农民。问过我从那里来、路上辛苦后又出去了。不大功夫，他左臂夹着张案板，右手拿着把明晃晃的菜刀进来。冬莲说：“走的渴啦，吃个西瓜吧。”武乡县村村出西瓜，这一带尤其出名。冬莲说：“如今家家都种着些，谁家也摘六、七十个。不为卖钱，专为下地回来热慌慌的解渴。”
    漂亮的房子，美丽的陈设，女儿在学校读书，劳动过后吃那又凉又甜的大西瓜——这是什么样人家过的生活？
    老根据地的人民和革命干部有说不尽道不完的战斗情谊。我和房主人还是初次见面，却像久别重逢的知心朋友，见了面就无话不谈了。
    原来郝冬莲的家庭是这样的。
    早先，家里很穷。父亲死的早，母亲给地主作饭，养不活她姐弟四人，两石米卖了哥哥，几斗粮卖了姐姐，冬莲跟着母亲给地主看孩子，大些了也作饭。可是生活没有使这个女孩子屈服，反倒使她更坚强起来。她饿得宁肯喝涮锅水，也要把饭留给妈妈吃，浑身冻得像个红萝卜，一片破布也要补在妈妈的破衣上。因此，母亲几次想把她卖掉，几次都舍不得这个好闺女；几次想把这勤劳貌美的女儿嫁给财主家，几次都被这倔强的小姑娘拒绝了。最后，冬莲看上了比自己大十多岁的给地主放羊的张五福，结婚了。这是“七七”抗战那年的事。五福弟兄五人，虽然都是如铁似钢的好汉子，一个赛一个的“好劳动”，却连自家的肚子也填不满。他全家只有二亩三分坡地，弟兄五人一个下煤窑，两个扛长工，一个佃种着地主几亩地，五福给地主放羊。一年到头，只有腊月三十晚上，五弟兄才能见一次面。那时，弟兄们双肩扛着一张嘴，两手抱着个空肚子，齐聚在那眼破窑里，从荒山上刨来几个荆圪塔，拢着个火，面对面地叹息到天明。而后，又各自回到“东家”那里，牛马般地劳动去了……。
    “不说这败兴的话了，那种日子永世也不会再来啦！”冬莲摇了摇头，改变了话题：“如今我家有三十四亩地，一头牛，去年收了五十四石粮食，今年入了农业生产合作社，顶少要收入七十石。”
    一家七口，收入七十石粮，生活怎么会不好？
    窑上沟村，并不只郝冬莲一家过着这样丰裕的生活。我连续访问了十多家，家家如此。现在，窑上沟村共有二百二十一户人家。支部书记王锦云告诉我：村上有一半以上的人家——一百二十七户有余粮七百二十五石；“全村只有四户贫农，有八户缺吃粮——一户差三个月粮，那七家差个把月。”
    “怎么四户贫农，倒有八户缺粮？”
    “贫农是从土地、农具上看比别人少些，生活倒不坏。”锦云解释：“这八家缺粮户都有特殊原因。就像郑国胜家吧，本来日子挺好，他偏偏异想天开，去年作起投机买卖来，结果赔了账，垮了。”
    “村上有富农么？”
    “没有，”锦云回答：“我村没有雇长工的，没有出租地的，大家生活都很好，也很少有借贷的。就是有的人家一时手里不方便，乡亲们也不要利钱。”过了一阵，他又补充道：“眼下，我们正准备成立信贷社，把人们的余粮余钱用起来。”
    早先那社会，要是有一家富起来，那就会有许多人家穷下去。现在，在新中国，在窑上沟，那情形已经完全倒转过来了，已经不是一人富万人穷，可说是万人富无人穷了。
    恋爱和结婚
    窑上沟村，不光人们的物质生活起了根本的变化，已从穷困走向富裕；人们的精神生活，也在迅速地变化着。旧社会遗留给人们的旧思想旧风俗，正为新思想新风俗所代替。我在窑上沟看到了一对正在恋爱的青年人，也认识了一对刚刚结婚的新夫妇。
    这一对正在恋爱的青年人，男的叫韩银旺，女的叫史娥子。
    史娥子十八岁了，细眉大眼，配上她那圆圆的面庞，显得又秀丽又英俊。她的性情淑静温柔，从没跟人发过急，红过脸。她的劳动在全村妇女中是数得着的：锄草便锄草，追青便追青，收割便收割，样样拿得起放得下。夏天割蒿压绿肥时，妇女们的任务是每人割五百斤，全村一百三十五个妇女都超过了任务，可是割到八百斤以上的，全村只有八个人，史娥子就是里面的一个。
    村里的青年们人人都爱史娥子，可是她只爱一个名叫韩银旺的青年人。
    韩银旺是村里的民校教员，今年参加了农业生产合作社，在自己的耕作组里，最早开展起读报工作，后来别的耕作组都学着这样作，可是赶不上韩银旺组作的好。韩银旺还是村里图书室的管理员，每次娥子去借书时，他总是向她说：“又来新书啦，这本你看着最合适。”就是这样，两个人在图书室，在民校，在农业生产合作社的集体劳动中，慢慢恋爱起来了。几个月以后，两个人就要求订婚了。可是困难也在这里，沉寂寡言的史娥子，到这时候还没有把自己同银旺恋爱的事情跟父母说过一个字。固然，如今的婚姻是自己作主，可是如果闹的全家不高兴也不好啊。
    “两个青年就找我来了。”支部书记王锦云谈起这件事情时说：“我一看，觉着二人挺合适，就帮他们跟娥子她娘说去了。你猜娥子她娘说什么？”
    “她娘说：‘自由婚姻是好事情，他们只要自己愿意，我当娘的没意见，既然她问我啦，我也得说说：银旺也是个好孩子，模样儿品行都不错，就是劳动上差点。’我就说啦，银旺劳动上不坏呀！‘是不坏，’娥子她娘说：‘可也不像俺娥子是全村最好的呀！不过还是那句话，只要他们自己愿意，我没意见，这不过是当娘的一片心……。”
    “真是好妈妈，不包办儿女亲事，也尽了当母亲的责任。”几天以后，我看到史娥子的母亲，想起那天王锦云说的话，就这样向她说。娥子的母亲笑起来，她说：“其实我是故意那么说说，银旺可是个好孩子，也是恨铁不成钢，为儿女瞎操心呗。”
    “两人什么时候结婚？”
    “还没日子呢，”她回答，随后又满意地笑起来：“我那意见灵验啦，银旺非要等着当上社里的劳动模范才结婚哩。”
    我问起她们的家庭生活情形，她说：“去年打了三十石粮，今年入了农业生产合作社，她爹说，社里庄稼长得好，至少能分四十多石。”
    “收这么多粮食，娥子结婚时，可要作两件漂亮嫁装了。”
    “我也是这么说呀！可是你不知道我们那姑娘，人家说：什么也不要。如今只要有人兴出个新道道来，谁都抢着学。”过了一阵，娥子母亲又对我说：“这几天你尽跟怀旺他们在一起，总知道他的事吧，我们这位也要跟他学呢。”
    怀旺的事谁不知道？受过上级表扬，也登过报，一位青年诗人还为他写过一首长诗呢。
    怀旺姓韩，青年团员，农业生产合作社的青年劳动模范。他们的事情发生在今年六月间。
    六月正是麦秋的时候，人们顶星星戴月亮地在地里割麦，忙的伸不直腰。可是怀旺却找农业生产合作社社长请假去了。合作社社长就是支部书记王锦云。论乡俚，怀旺叫锦云表叔呢！
    “表叔，我请个假。”
    “大忙的麦秋，请假作甚去？”那时候，锦云正和县里一个干部谈合作社的麦收情况，漫不经心地问。
    “到区里去一趟，”怀旺申述理由：“有要紧的事。”
    再问，还是说有要紧的事，但什么要紧的事呢？便不说了。要是别人像这样请假，准请不下，可是怀旺就不同了：从去年到现在，论劳动、论学习，不管那方面全是第一，每回过爱国日检查爱国公约时，都是模范，回回光荣榜上有他的名字。所以怀旺这种毫无理由的请假，竟例外的被批准了。
    傍晚，人们正要收工回家的时候，忽然看见怀旺兴冲冲地从区上回来了。他肩上扛着一条花被子，手里提着一个小包包。最惹人注意的是怀旺身后还跟着一个穿花衣裳的年青姑娘。
    社员们老远就向怀旺打起招呼来：“扛的什么呀，怀旺——给人捎的？”
    “自家的。”
    真怪，怀旺竟这么回答。他那黑苍苍的脸，高兴得简直要放光了；他后边那个姑娘只是低着头，抿着嘴儿笑，脸红得像黄昏的彩霞。
    大家一看就明白了：“哈！怀旺要结婚了吧。”
    人们一涌而上，把怀旺他俩围在中心。这个跟怀旺开玩笑，那个向怀旺作鬼脸；有的把花被子抢过来，反过来倒过去地察看着；有人抢过他手里的小包包，一个劲儿地只顾捏，急的怀旺赶紧嚷道：
    “别捏，别捏，那是挂面。”
    这姑娘叫香花，是北面二里路上合村的人。
    刹那间，怀旺结婚的消息就传遍全村了。怀旺和香花刚到家，全村男女就都挤到院里来了。合作社社长听说了，也赶来啦。
    “你这孩，这有甚害羞的，告假还不肯说。”合作社社长一面说，一面双手分开众人来到中间，便又问二人道：“甚日子结婚呢？”
    “就今日晚上。”
    “那么——好，咱们举行个结婚会吧。”锦云说：“我当主席。”
    结婚典礼开始了。这个结婚典礼不拜天地，不祭鬼神，只向毛主席鞠躬；不骑马坐轿，不大张酒筵，连结婚的被子都是新娘子家带来的。但从来没见过这么热闹的婚礼，好像整个村子都搬到怀旺家里来了，嘻嘻哈哈，嚷成一片，笑作一团。每逢村里开什么会，总是青年们说呀道的嚷在前头，老人们蹲在一边叭哒叭哒地吸烟，可是这回也不同了。
    “这样好，”老汉们评论：“过去咱穷人就娶不上个媳妇，这咱二斤挂面就把事办了。”
    老婆婆们张着没牙的嘴，一个劲地笑。
    “一辈子的大事，这么了草，”快要聘闺女的史大娘笑了一阵子，不知为什么，眼里又有点湿润：“连个轿也不坐，走着就来了。”
    “你大婶可别那么说”，站在她旁边的一个头发都快白了的老太太说：“咱那时坐轿，可两眼哭的铜铃似的，看人家这走来的，笑的嘴都闭不上了。”
    “结婚大会”越开越热闹，人越来越高兴，青年们闹腾的最欢，提的问题最多：“你俩怎的恋爱来，也教教咱”，“谁先跟谁说的？”……说啊、笑啊、唱啊、闹啊，夜深了，怀旺家还像唱戏样的热闹呢。
    第二天，太阳还没出来，耕作组的人们早已在地里匆忙地割麦子了。紧张的劳动，一点也妨碍不了人们对怀旺的喜事的谈论：“人家这结婚是不是也像早先人们结婚那样，头一夜谁也不肯先睡，背对背的坐一夜？”
    “问怀旺吧，”眼快的人说：“你看，他俩来了。”
    现在的事情就是新奇，昨天的结婚仪式已够让人忘不掉了，结婚的第二天，新郎新妇就下地生产，更是没有听人说过。人们也顾不得问新婚之夜究竟是何情景了，便七嘴八舌地说：
    “看他俩割的快慢吧，要是割的慢，就是昨天夜里没好好睡觉。”
    “那要叫香花负责……”
    新郎新娘不答言，两个人对看了一眼，就弯下腰去，镰刀飞舞起来，不大一会，怀旺就割到大永前头去了。香花紧紧地跟在他身边。大家欢笑着，镰刀闪闪发光，追赶一对新人。（全文未完）
