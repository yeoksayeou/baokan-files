Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 29th – On November 21st and 22nd, the enemy used less than a company of troops to attack our army's positions on the left side of the Shangganling mountain range. Only small-scale battles occurred in other areas of Shangganling. This indicates that Van Fleet's offensive is weakening day by day. At the same time, after suffering over 400 casualties from our army's blocking fire and artillery fire in these two days, the enemy has further shrunk back into their fortifications, afraid to act rashly again.

After the enemy's ground offensive failed, they became enraged and dispatched a large number of aircraft to carry out a frenzied bombing of the Shangganling area. However, the enemy's air force also suffered a disastrous defeat. On the 22nd, enemy aircraft carried out three air raids on the area, dispatching 328 sorties. Our frontline anti-aircraft units rose up to meet the attack, firing fiercely at the enemy aircraft. In this day's counter-bombing battle, our army shot down four enemy aircraft and damaged twenty-seven.

At the same time, our army continued to actively attack the enemy in the area west of Shangganling. On the night of the 23rd, a reconnaissance unit ambushed the enemy on the highway north of the Iron Ridge defense bridge and south of Songjeong. When two platoons of the enemy entered the ambush area, our army immediately opened fire. During the battle, two more platoons of enemy troops heard the sound and came to reinforce them. Our army then withdrew to its own positions after killing and wounding more than 50 enemy soldiers. On the night of the 24th, our army sent another unit to sneak to a small hill south of Height 391 north of Iron Ridge, launching a fierce attack on a platoon of enemy soldiers on the mountain. After a fierce battle, we occupied the height and captured three light machine guns and twelve automatic rifles. The enemy abandoned eight corpses and fled south.

On the 24th, a reconnaissance team from our army engaged a company of British troops in Jigok-ri, west of Yeoncheon. Our reconnaissance soldiers immediately monitored the enemy while sending someone back to report to the unit. The unit immediately dispatched reinforcements in two directions. After five hours of fierce fighting, over 140 enemy soldiers were annihilated.

In the five days from the 21st to the 25th, our frontline anti-aircraft units shot down a total of thirteen enemy aircraft and damaged fifty-seven. Our artillery units independently killed and wounded over 1,200 enemy soldiers and destroyed and damaged eleven enemy tanks.

    朝中部队续在上甘岭击退敌人陆空军进攻
    前线对空射击部队五天击落击伤敌机七十架
    【新华社朝鲜前线二十九日电】十一月二十一日和二十二日，敌人只用了不到一个连的兵力，向上甘岭左边山岭上我军阵地进攻。在上甘岭其他地区也仅发生小规模的战斗。这说明范佛里特的攻势，已经日甚一日地衰落下去了。同时，敌人在这两天中遭到我军阻击火力和炮火杀伤其四百多人后，更加蜷缩在工事里，不敢再轻举妄动了。
    敌人于地面进攻失利之后，恼羞成怒，出动了大批飞机，对上甘岭地区进行疯狂轰炸。但是敌人的空军也同样遭到了惨败。二十二日，敌机对该地区先后进行三次空袭，出动飞机达三百二十八架次。我军前线对空射击部队奋起迎击，以猛烈的炮火向敌机射击。在这一天反轰炸战斗中，我军共击落敌机四架，击伤敌机二十七架。
    与此同时，我军继续在上甘岭以西地区积极袭击敌人。二十三日夜，我军一支侦察部队到铁原北防御桥和松亭以南的公路上去伏击敌人。等敌人两个排来到伏击区内时，我军立即开火。在战斗中，敌军又有两个排闻声赶来增援。我军便在杀伤敌五十多人后撤回自己的阵地。二十四日夜，我军又派出一支部队潜至铁原北三九一高地南面的一个小高地下，向山上的一个排敌人展开猛袭，经激战后占领了这个高地，并缴获三挺轻机枪和十二枝自动枪，敌人丢下八具尸体往南逃去。
    二十四日，我军一个侦察小组在涟川以西基谷里与英军一个连发生了遭遇战。我军侦察员们立即一面监视着敌人，一面派人回部队报告。部队立刻派援兵分两路出击，经过五小时的激战，歼敌一百四十余名。
    从二十一日到二十五日的五天中，我军前线对空射击部队共击落敌机十三架、击伤敌机五十七架。我炮兵部队单独击毙和击伤敌军一千二百多名，击毁和击伤敌军坦克十一辆。
