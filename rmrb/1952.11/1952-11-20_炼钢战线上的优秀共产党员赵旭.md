Party Life

    Excellent Communist Party Member Zhao Xu on the Steelmaking Front

    Zhao Xu is the leader (and a Communist Party member) of the “Resist America, Aid Korea” electric furnace model production group in the foundry department of the Tangshan Steel Plant. Although he is only twenty-seven years old this year, he has been working for nearly sixteen years. Before liberation, Zhao Xu was always assigned as an “outside worker” because he was unwilling to bribe factory management. His monthly salary was only enough to buy one and a half bags of flour, and he had to pay two-thirds of it to the reactionary government as "conscription fees." As a result, Zhao Xu's family of four lived a very hard life, rarely getting a full meal every three days. After liberation, Zhao Xu became a steelworker. Whenever he mentions this, Zhao Xu is so excited that he almost bursts into tears. He says, "Without the Communist Party, I would have been an 'outside worker' all my life."

    When Zhao Xu was learning to make steel, he had some ideological concerns. He thought, "People say that to learn how to make steel, you have to know foreign languages, but I can't even write my name well. How can I do it?" But when he thought that this was a task assigned to him by the Party, he was filled with energy. In a month and a half, he was able to independently manage a furnace. Zhao Xu then studied even more diligently, wanting to learn all the skills of the master workers. He became more responsible for his work, often saying to the workers in his group: "The state has entrusted the furnace to us, so we must take extra care of it!"

    Now, the workers all praise Zhao Xu's high level of skill. This young steelworker, like an old worker, can tell the carbon content of the steel, distinguish the grade of the steel, by the height of the flames emitted from the molten steel and the number of forks in the sparks, from the swirls and colors of the newly broken steel block, and from the strength and distance of the flames emitted when the steel block is rubbed on a grinding wheel. The workers say, "Old Zhao's eyes are the laboratory!" But Zhao Xu is not complacent at all, and still humbly studies scientific knowledge, especially Soviet scientific steelmaking knowledge.

    In mid-June of this year, before the steel plant's patriotic production increase and conservation campaign began, the Party branch of the steel plant called on the three shifts of the "Resist America, Aid Korea" electric furnace to learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet "rapid steelmaking method," strive to further shorten smelting time, and create more wealth for the country. At that time, many workers on the electric furnace lacked confidence. They said, "Since liberation, the time has already been shortened three or four times. The current smelting time is something that everyone wouldn't even dare to imagine during the Japanese devils' and Kuomintang's rule. The time is short enough, and it can't be shortened any further!" "All the tricks have already been found, and the potential has already been exhausted. Any further digging can only result in holes in the furnace walls!" Some workers in Zhao Xu's group also said, "The Soviet elder brothers have good equipment, but our conditions are not good. If we go any faster, something might go wrong!" But Zhao Xu said with confidence, "If the Soviets can do it, we can do it too." Zhao Xu found a book introducing the Soviet "rapid steelmaking method" and studied it with everyone, and after combining it with the actual situation of his group, finally came to the conclusion that the "rapid steelmaking method" could be adopted. After everyone had confidence, Zhao Xu put forward the political mobilization slogan of "Maintaining Glory, Forever Moving Forward," which immediately stirred up the enthusiasm of the workers. Everyone expressed, "Resolutely learn the 'rapid steelmaking method' and further shorten the smelting time."

    However, under China's current specific conditions, adopting the "rapid steelmaking method" is difficult and requires arduous struggle. Zhao Xu's group's first experiment was not completely successful. When smelting the third furnace, the time was not shortened, but a lot of raw materials were wasted. Some workers' thinking fluctuated. Individual technicians said "it can't be learned." But Zhao Xu was not discouraged. At the group meeting, he first examined his own responsibility, explaining that he should be responsible for the failure of this furnace of steel. He used the fact that the other two furnaces were successfully smelted to show that this advanced experience could be adopted. He also used the fact that Soviet experts had helped them make steel to encourage everyone to continue experimenting. At this time, everyone felt enlightened again. Zhao Xu and everyone studied the reasons for the failure of the third furnace and decided to pay attention to them in the next experiment.

    After Zhao Xu and his group's unremitting experiments and the guidance of technicians, and with reference to the advanced experience of the Soviet "rapid steelmaking method," a draft of operating regulations for rapid steelmaking was finally formulated. The experiment of the "rapid steelmaking method" was successful. Not only could the average time per furnace be shortened by forty minutes for smelting high-carbon steel, and fifty-six minutes for smelting high-manganese steel, but even the most difficult nickel-chromium alloy steel (double-slag steel) was shortened by an average of one hour and nine minutes per furnace. In this way, the "Resist America, Aid Korea" electric furnace group could increase the country's wealth by 3.8 billion yuan throughout the year. This victory greatly encouraged the learning enthusiasm of the workers throughout the plant, and they admitted that "the Soviet elder brother's method is really good."

    However, some people in the technical supervision section had not fully understood the situation ideologically. They said, "This way of making steel is not scientific!" Zhao Xu then educated these people with facts. He requested a chemical analysis, and the analysis results proved that the chemical composition of the steel was completely qualified, and the cast objects were all first-class products. This made the steelmaking engineers, who had held a skeptical attitude, completely convinced of the advanced Soviet experience.

    When the "rapid steelmaking method" was promoted throughout the plant, some people with conservative ideas were still unwilling to use the new method to make steel. Zhao Linfang, the leader of the first production group of the "Resist America, Aid Korea" electric furnace, was one of them. Zhao Linfang said, "This method is not as smooth as the old method, and I'm not confident." When the workers in the group proposed to learn this advanced experience, Zhao Linfang asked, "Who will be responsible if the phosphorus is high!" One day, when Zhao Xu was handing over the shift, he asked Zhao Linfang to also adopt the "rapid steelmaking method," but Zhao Linfang still said, "I'm not confident." In this way, another furnace of steel wasted forty to fifty minutes. Zhao Xu criticized Zhao Linfang in the smelting record book, and at the same time taught the "rapid steelmaking method" to Yuan Yushan (a member of the Communist Youth League), the first assistant in Zhao Linfang's group, and asked him to take the lead in learning. Zhao Xu also mobilized Zhao Linfang to visit his group's site and specifically explained the advantages of the "rapid steelmaking method" and the shortcomings of the old steelmaking method to him. Only then did Zhao Linfang accept the new steelmaking method. The "rapid steelmaking method" was promoted in all three shifts of the electric furnace. Zhao Linfang's group, which had never completed its tasks since the furnace was opened, overfulfilled its task in July after learning the "rapid steelmaking method," and the quality of the steel was very good. Everyone admired Zhao Xu and his advanced production group even more.

    Zhao Xu constantly helped the workers in his group improve their skills, and through practical examples, he often conducted political education for the workers, constantly improving their class consciousness. Therefore, in this group, not only did the furnace-front assistants make rapid progress in technology, but even the pot-takers and ingot-makers, who didn't care about the furnace-front situation at all, also learned a lot of steelmaking knowledge. In this way, their work was done even better.

    Zhao Xu's requirements for improving steelmaking technology are limitless. In order to make steel even better, they established a furnace-front meeting system. They conducted a study after each furnace of steel was produced, and recorded the results of the study in a notebook. Here are a few excerpts from their furnace-front meeting records:

    "June 27th: Comrade Wu Junhe has created a method for repairing the furnace spout. This not only saves 20 to 30 kilograms of magnesia sand every day, but also extends the life of the furnace spout by twenty times.

    July 6th: Today, smelting high-manganese steel saved a lot of time compared to before. This is the result of everyone's efforts to learn the Soviet 'rapid steelmaking method.'

    July 13th: At night, both furnaces were all first-class products. This is because the furnace front, ingot making, and pot taking coordinated well.

    ...Comrade Wu Junhe delayed slag removal by one minute, which affected the shortening of smelting time."

    Zhao Xu can also humbly learn from technical personnel, and actively report furnace-front conditions to technical personnel and ask them for guidance. Once, a furnace of steel had problems with high phosphorus and high carbon. Although Zhao Xu had already led his group to conduct research, in order to understand the problem more deeply and solve it better, he asked technicians Yu Zhenye and workshop director Wang Jiliang for advice. As a result, his original understanding was improved.

    Zhao Xu and his group are always moving forward.

### 炼钢战线上的优秀共产党员赵旭

    炼钢战线上的优秀共产党员赵旭
    赵旭是唐山钢厂铸造部“抗美援朝号”电炉模范生产小组的组长（共产党员），虽然今年才二十七岁，但是已有近十六年的工龄了。在解放前，赵旭因为不愿向工厂管理人员进行贿赂，一直被分配当“外工”，一个月工钱仅仅够买一袋半面粉，还要把三分之二作为“征兵费”缴给反动政府。因此，赵旭全家四口人的生活很苦，三天难吃上一顿饱饭。解放后，赵旭当了炼钢工人。一提起这件事情，赵旭就激动得简直要掉下泪来，他说：“要没有共产党，一辈子只能当个‘外工’。”
    赵旭学炼钢时，也有过一些思想顾虑。他想：“人家说，学炼钢得懂洋文，可是自己连名字也写不好，这怎么成呢？”但他想到这是党交给他的任务，就浑身有了劲。一个半月，他就能够独自掌握一个炉子。赵旭于是更加虚心学习，要把老师傅的本领全部学会。他对工作更加负责，经常对本组的工友说：“国家把炉子交给我们了，我们就得多加小心照管着！”
    现在，工友们都称赞赵旭的技术高。这位年青的炼钢工人，已经像老年工人似的，能够从钢水喷射出的火线的高低和火花叉数的多少，从那新折断的钢块的窝纹和颜色，以及把钢块在砂轮上磨擦时火线放射的强弱远近，看出钢的含碳量，分辨出钢品的等差。工友们说：“老赵的眼睛就是化验室啊！”但赵旭毫不自满，依然虚心地学习科学知识，尤其是苏联的科学炼钢知识。
    今年六月中旬，钢厂爱国增产节约竞赛开始前，钢厂的党号召“抗美援朝号”电炉的三个班学习苏联“快速炼钢法”先进经验，争取再缩短冶炼时间，为国家创造更多的财富。当时电炉上有不少工友没有信心，他们说：“解放后已经缩短过三四次时间了，现在的冶炼时间，在日本鬼子和国民党统治时代，大家想都不敢想。时间够短了，不能再缩短了！”“窍门早找光了，潜力早挖绝了，再挖只能在炉墙上挖窟窿了！”赵旭小组的个别工友也说：“苏联老大哥的设备好，咱们的条件不行，再快怕出毛病！”赵旭却有信心地说：“苏联能炼，咱们也能炼。”赵旭找了一本介绍苏联“快速炼钢法”的书和大家学习，并结合本组的实际情况进行研究，终于得出可以采用“快速炼钢法”的结论。在大家有了信心之后，赵旭提出了“保持光荣，永远前进”的政治鼓动口号，一下子把工友们的劲头都鼓动起来了。大家表示：“坚决学习‘快速炼钢法’，再缩短冶炼时间。”
    但在我国当前的具体条件下，采用“快速炼钢法”是有困难的，得经过艰苦的斗争。赵旭小组第一次试验没有完全成功。炼第三炉时，时间没有缩短，反而浪费了不少原料。有些工友的思想就波动了。个别技术人员说“学不成了”。但是赵旭并没有灰心。他在小组会上首先检查了自己的责任，说明这一炉钢没炼好，应该由他负责。他用其他两炉炼好的事实说明这种先进经验是可以采用的。他又用苏联专家曾经帮助他们炼钢的事实来鼓励大家继续试验。这时，大家心里又亮了。赵旭和大家研究出了第三炉失败的原因，要在下一次试验中加以注意。
    经过赵旭和他小组的百折不回的试验和技术人员的指导，参照苏联“快速炼钢法”先进经验，终于制订出了快速炼钢的操作规程草案。“快速炼钢法”的试验成功了。不但炼高碳钢每炉平均可以缩短时间四十分钟，炼高锰钢缩短五十六分钟；就是最难炼的镍铬合金钢（双渣钢）每炉也都平均缩短了一小时又九分钟。这样“抗美援朝号”电炉组全年就可以给国家增产三十八亿元的财富。这个胜利，大大鼓舞了全厂工友的学习情绪，承认“苏联老大哥的方法真好”。
    但技术监督课的某些人员的思想还没有完全搞通，他们说：“这样炼钢不合科学！”赵旭又用事实教育了这些人。他请求化验，化验结果证明了钢的化学成分完全合格，所浇铸的物件完全是一级品。这使得抱怀疑态度的炼钢工程师也完全信服苏联的先进经验了。
    在全厂推行“快速炼钢法”时，有保守思想的人仍旧不愿用新方法炼钢。“抗美援朝号”电炉组的第一班生产小组长赵林芳就是其中的一个。赵林芳说：“这个法子还不如老法子顺手，没把握。”当小组的工友提出要学习这一先进经验时，赵林芳问：“磷高了谁负责！”有一天，赵旭交班时要赵林芳也采用“快速炼钢法”，赵林芳仍说“没把握”。这样一炉钢又浪费了四五十分钟的时间。赵旭在冶炼记录本上对赵林芳提出批评，同时把“快速炼钢法”传授给赵林芳小组的第一助手袁玉山（青年团员），要他带头学习。赵旭又动员赵林芳到他小组的现场参观，具体地给他讲解了“快速炼钢法”的优点和旧炼钢法的缺点。这才使赵林芳接受了新的炼钢法。“快速炼钢法”就在电炉的三个班推广开了。赵林芳小组打开炉起一直没完成过任务，学会“快速炼钢法”以后，七月份就超额完成了任务，而且钢的质量很好。大家更加佩服赵旭和他的先进生产小组。
    赵旭对于本组的工友，更是不断地帮助他们提高技术，并通过实际事例，经常向工友们进行政治教育，不断提高他们的阶级觉悟。因此在这个小组内，不光炉前助手技术进步很快，就连根本不管炉前情形的取锅工、造块工，也都懂得了很多炼钢知识。这样，他们的工作就作得更好了。
    对于炼钢技术的改进，赵旭的要求是无限止的。为了把钢炼得更好，他们就建立了一种炉前会议制度。出一炉钢，就作一次研究，把研究结果记在本子上。这里摘录几段他们炉前会议的记录：
    “六月二十七日：吴俊和同志又创造出修补炉嘴的办法。这样不但每天节省二十到三十公斤的镁砂，而且使炉嘴寿命延长二十倍。
    七月六日：今日炼高锰钢比以前节省了不少时间。这是大家努力学习苏联‘快速炼钢法’的结果。
    七月十三日：夜，两炉全是一级品，这是炉前、造块、取锅配合得好。
    ……吴俊和同志出渣时，耽误一分钟，影响了缩短冶炼时间。”
    赵旭又能虚心地向技术人员学习，并且主动地向技术人员反映炉前情况，请他们指导。有一次有一炉钢发生了磷高、碳高的问题。赵旭虽然已领导本组作了研究，但为了对问题了解得更加深刻，解决得更好，他就向技术员于振业、车间主任王季良请教，结果，使自己原有的认识提高了一步。
    赵旭和他的小组，永远在前进着。
