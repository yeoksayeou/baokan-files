Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 14th: According to the US side, another Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoner of war "hanged himself" in the US POW camp on Jeju Island on November 11th. The US and British news agencies reported that more than 14,000 Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war in this POW camp were said by the US side to be "forcibly refusing repatriation." This exposes the secret of a series of prisoner of war "suicides by hanging" on Jeju Island. Many prisoners of war who were forced to "refuse repatriation" by US bayonets are being openly beaten to death or injured, or slowly tortured to death, precisely because they oppose forced detention and demand to be repatriated home. Acheson's so-called "no forced repatriation," which he continues to peddle at the United Nations, is a deception built on unprecedented crimes.

Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 13th: According to the US side, another prisoner of war "hanged himself" in the Jeju Island POW camp on November 10th. On September 21st and October 12th, the US side also announced that three prisoners of war in this POW camp had "hanged themselves." Why "suicide"? As usual, the US side doesn't mention a word.

Those on Jeju Island are mainly Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war who are falsely claimed by the US side to be in "anti-communist cooperation." Since September 21st, on this island, the number of prisoners of war who have been beaten to death or injured, according to the US side's own admission, is 232. For the prisoners of war who are openly massacred, the US side routinely adds a charge such as "demonstration" or "singing"; for the prisoners of war who die from unbearable persecution, the US side routinely dismisses it as "suicide by hanging."

All these massacre incidents fully prove that the prisoners of war on our side who are falsely claimed by the US side to be "unwilling to be repatriated even to the death" are actually constantly risking their lives to fight for the right to return to the motherland, while the US-Chiang agents are continuing to use all cruel means to force the prisoners of war to give up their right to repatriation. This heroic struggle of the prisoners of war began as early as last October. Although it has been subjected to a whole year of bloody suppression by the US side, this struggle is clearly continuing and is becoming more intense.

Many witnesses have reported to our side the criminal acts of the US side in forcing prisoners of war to "refuse repatriation." These witnesses are the prisoners of war who were forced by the US side to serve as airborne agents. According to their reports, on October 10th last year, Chiang Kai-shek bandit agents of the 86th Regiment of the US POW camp on Geoje Island, under the instruction of the US side, forced prisoners of war to hang Chiang Kai-shek bandit "national flags." The prisoners of war refused sternly and bravely tore the Chiang Kai-shek bandit "national flags" to pieces. The Chiang Kai-shek bandit police guards beat the prisoners of war severely, killing and wounding more than 20 prisoners of war on the spot. On the 15th of the same month, when prisoners of war Liang Zhaoxiang and others were escorted from Busan to the 72nd Regiment on Geoje Island, they saw Chiang Kai-shek bandit "national flags" hanging at the entrance of the regiment. They firmly demanded that this ugly flag be taken down, otherwise they would not enter the camp. The US soldiers escorting them beat them with gun butts, but they still held hands and refused to move. The US military then called in the Chiang Kai-shek bandit police guards, who beat them all unconscious and then carried them in one by one and imprisoned them.

Under the terrorist rule of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit agents, prisoners of war who slightly expressed their longing for the motherland and their desire to return to their country would be subjected to various tortures and heavy labor. Wang Jilong, a prisoner of war in the 72nd Regiment, imitated the tune of "Man Jiang Hong" and wrote a "Song of Yearning for the Country and Home," expressing his firm determination to return to the motherland. This song immediately spread throughout the entire regiment, and the prisoners of war all sang it. The Chiang Kai-shek bandit agents arrested Wang Jilong and beat him severely, and then assigned him to a labor squad, forcing him to engage in dangerous and heavy labor every day.

The Chiang Kai-shek bandit agents also openly promoted and actively worked within the POW camp to transfer the prisoners of war to the Taiwan Chiang Kai-shek bandits to serve as cannon fodder. In October last year, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit agents of the 72nd Regiment forced the prisoners of war to perform plays promoting service as cannon fodder for the Chiang Kai-shek bandits. Lin Xuepu, a prisoner of war in the 2nd Battalion of the regiment, changed the original line in the performance: "We want to go to Taiwan to join the National Army to counterattack the mainland" to "We are determined to return to the motherland," which immediately aroused applause from the prisoners of war in the audience. The Chiang Kai-shek bandit agents, pale as ghosts, dragged him off the stage and beat him severely. In late August last year, the US side instructed the Chiang Kai-shek bandit agents Li Daan and others to go to the 86th Regiment to establish reactionary organizations and coerced the prisoners of war to swear an oath to go to Taiwan. When Li was babbling nonsense, many prisoners of war shouted slogans such as "We want to return to the motherland" and "Down with the traitorous bandits" and rushed up, beating Li and carrying him back. That night, the fully armed US-Chiang Kai-shek guards, claiming to "search for the murderers of the riot," surrounded the camp and arrested many prisoners of war.

Many prisoners of war were subjected to cruel persecution and massacre by the Chiang Kai-shek bandit agents because they refused to get tattoos, refused to put blood fingerprints on the "voluntary repatriation" request forms, and opposed "screening." In October last year, Cao Ming, a prisoner of war in the 86th Regiment, refused to get tattoos and put blood fingerprints, and shouted to other prisoners of war: "Comrades, we want to return to the motherland, we will never serve as cannon fodder for the United States." After saying that, he sang the song "Grandma Wang Wants Peace." Many prisoners of war followed suit. The Chiang Kai-shek bandit agents used force to disperse the prisoners of war and arrested Cao Ming. That night he was taken out of the camp and has since disappeared. In the same month, a prisoner of war who had been a feeder in the Chinese People's Volunteer Army firmly demanded to return to the motherland during the forced "screening" by the Chiang Kai-shek bandit agents. The Chiang Kai-shek bandit agents beat him severely with clubs, forcing him to "refuse repatriation." He said sternly: "So this is what you call 'voluntary repatriation.' Your terrorist tactics will never change our determination." The Chiang Kai-shek bandit agents later continued to torture him with brutal means such as assigning him to hard labor and reducing his food rations. He finally committed suicide because he could not withstand the cruel persecution of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit agents.

The names of the prisoners of war who were forced to serve as airborne agents and provided this ironclad evidence are all listed on the prisoner of war list submitted by the US side. No matter what flowery words Acheson and his lackeys use, they cannot disguise the stinking deception of "no forced repatriation."

    济州岛我方被俘人员争取重返祖国的斗争彻底揭穿了美方所谓“不强迫遣返”的骗局
    【新华社开城十四日电】据美方宣布：十一月十一日在济州岛美方战俘营内又有一名中国人民志愿军战俘“上吊自杀”。美、英通讯社报道，这个战俘营中的一万四千多名中国人民志愿军战俘都是被美方说是“要用强力拒绝遣返”的。这就揭穿了济州岛上一连串战俘“上吊自杀”事件的秘密。许多被美方用刺刀强迫“拒绝遣返”的战俘，正因为反对强迫扣留、要求遣返回家而被公开地打死打伤，或是被慢慢地折磨而死。艾奇逊在联合国继续贩卖的所谓“不强迫遣返”，就是这样一个建筑在史无前例的罪行上的骗局。
    【新华社开城十三日电】据美方宣布，十一月十日在济州岛战俘营内又有一名战俘“上吊自杀”。九月二十一日和十月十二日，美方也曾宣布在这个战俘营中有三名战俘“上吊自杀”。为什么“自杀”？美方照例一字不提。
    在济州岛上的主要是被美方谎称为“反共合作”的中国人民志愿军被俘人员。从九月二十一日以来，在这个岛上，被打死打伤的战俘，仅仅美方自己承认的就有二百三十二人。对于被公开屠杀的战俘，美方照例给他们加上一个“示威”或“唱歌”之类的罪名；对于战俘不堪迫害而死，美方照例轻描淡写地称之为“上吊自杀”。
    所有这些屠杀事件充分证明：被美方谎称为“宁死不愿遣返”的我方被俘人员，实际上是在不断地冒死争取重返祖国的权利，而美蒋特务则正在继续用一切残酷手段逼迫战俘放弃遣返的权利。战俘的这个英勇斗争，早在去年十月就已经展开。虽然经过美方整整一年的血腥镇压，这个斗争却显然仍在继续，而且更趋激烈了。
    已经有许多见证人向我方报告了美方强迫战俘“拒绝遣返”的罪恶行为。这些见证人就是被美方强迫充当空降特务的战俘。据他们报告，去年十月十日，巨济岛美方战俘营第八十六联队的蒋匪特务，在美方指使下强迫战俘悬挂蒋匪“国旗”。战俘严予拒绝，并且英勇地撕碎了蒋匪“国旗”。蒋匪警备队就毒打战俘，当场打死打伤战俘二十多名。同月十五日，战俘梁兆祥等十余人被从釜山押到巨济岛第七十二联队去时，看见联队门口挂着蒋匪“国旗”。他们坚决要求拿掉这面丑恶的旗帜，否则就不走进营场去。押送他们的美军用枪托毒打他们，他们仍然手挽着手，一步也不走。美军就叫来了蒋匪警备队，把他们全都打伤打昏，然后一个个抬进去囚禁起来。
    在蒋匪特务的恐怖统治下，战俘稍为表示对祖国的怀念和遣返回国的愿望，就要遭到各种酷刑和被罚处苦重劳役。第七十二联队战俘王济隆仿照满江红词调，写了一首“怀国思家词”，表示返回祖国的坚定决心。这首词立刻传遍全联队，战俘都唱起来了。蒋匪特务就把王济隆抓去毒打，又把他编入苦役队，每天强迫他从事危险性的苦重劳役。
    蒋匪特务更在战俘营内公开宣传和积极活动把战俘移交给台湾蒋匪充当炮灰。去年十月间，第七十二联队的蒋匪特务强迫战俘演出话剧，宣传为蒋匪充当炮灰。该联队二大队战俘林学普在演出时把原来一句台词：“我们要到台湾去参加国军反攻大陆”，改念为“我们坚决要回到祖国去”，立即引起全场战俘的鼓掌。面如土色的蒋匪特务就把他拉下台来毒打。去年八月下旬，美方指使蒋匪特务李大安等到第八十六联队去成立反动组织，胁迫战俘宣誓到台湾去，当李匪正在胡说八道时，许多战俘高呼着“我们要回祖国去”、“打倒汉奸卖国贼”等口号冲上去，把李匪打得抬了回去。当天半夜，全副武装的美蒋警备队扬言“搜查暴动凶手”，包围了营场，逮捕去许多战俘。
    许多战俘因为拒绝刺字，拒绝在“自愿遣返”的请求书上盖血印，和反对“甄别”而遭到蒋匪特务的残酷迫害和屠杀。去年十月间，第八十六联队战俘曹明拒绝刺字和盖血印，并且向其他战俘高呼说：“同志们，我们要回到祖国去，我们决不充当美国的炮灰。”说罢就高唱“王大妈要和平”歌曲。许多战俘都跟着唱起来。蒋匪特务就用武力驱散战俘，并逮捕了曹明，当晚他被押出了营场，以后就失踪了。同月，有一个原在中国人民志愿军任饲养员的战俘，在蒋匪特务强行“甄别”时，坚决要求返回祖国。蒋匪特务用棍棒毒打他，强迫他“拒绝遣返”。他厉声说：“你们叫喊的‘自愿遣返’原来就是如此。你们的恐怖手段绝不能改变我们的决心。”蒋匪特务后来继续用派苦工、减少食粮等残暴手段来折磨他。他终于因为受不住蒋匪特务的残酷迫害而自杀了。
    提供这些铁证的被迫充当空降特务的战俘的名字，都开列在美方交来的战俘名单上。艾奇逊及其奴才们不论用什么花言巧语，也不能把臭气薰天的“不强迫遣返”的骗局装扮起来。
