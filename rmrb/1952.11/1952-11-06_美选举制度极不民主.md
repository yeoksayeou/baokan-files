Xinhua News Agency, New York, November 4th: The US election campaign ended on November 3rd, according to TASS. The election is on November 4th.

The US presidential election is conducted in two stages. On November 4th, voters elect not the president, but the electors nominated by the different parties in each district. The electors elect the president in December. But in reality, the outcome of the presidential election is decided in November, because the party affiliation of the electors is common knowledge.

In form, the United States has declared the implementation of a "universal suffrage" system. However, American election laws prevent the broad masses of working people and those without property from participating in voting. For example, property restrictions in four southern states deprive a large number of propertyless black people of the right to vote. Poll taxes in five southern states deprive millions of poor people of the right to vote. Residency requirements in various states allow authorities to exclude seasonal workers and the unemployed who are forced to seek work in various places from the voter rolls.

Educational restrictions in nineteen states require voters to have English language skills and the ability to correctly explain the Constitution. This condition deprives those with less education, especially many workers and immigrants, of the right to vote.

The high age restriction currently in place in the United States (citizens must be twenty-one years old to vote) deprives a considerable proportion of young people of the right to participate in elections.

In addition, the laws of many other states allow authorities to arbitrarily deprive voters of the right to vote. For example, in some southern states, one must have "reputation" to have the right to vote. In Vermont, people must be of "orderly behaviour" to be included on the voter list.

All of these unreasonable restrictions prevent a large portion of the working people from voting. For example, in the last presidential election in 1948, twenty million people of voting age were deprived of the right to vote. According to the Associated Press, in this election, this number will increase to twenty-five million, accounting for a quarter of the number of people of voting age.

In the United States, a large proportion of voters usually do not participate in voting. Only about half of those of voting age participate in elections. In the 1948 presidential election, only 50 percent of those of voting age voted, while in the 1950 congressional elections, only slightly more than 40 percent of voters participated. This low voter turnout is not only due to the many restrictions on universal suffrage. This situation is also a result of the American working people's disappointment with the two parties' alternating rule, and their distrust of the promises made by the Democratic and Republican presidential candidates in their campaign speeches.

    美选举制度极不民主
    【新华社五日讯】据塔斯社纽约四日讯：美国的竞选运动已于十一月三日结束。十一月四日就要选举了。
    美国的总统选举是分两个阶段进行的。十一月四日选民选举的不是总统，而是不同的党派在选区内提名的选举人。选举人选举总统是在十二月举行。但是实际上，总统选举的结果在十一月里就决定了，因为选举人所属的党派是大家都知道的。
    在形式上，美国已宣布实行“普选”制度。然而，美国选举法却使广大劳动人民和没有财产的人无法参加投票。例如，南部四个州内的财产限制剥夺了广大没有财产的黑人投票的权利。南部五个州的人头税剥夺了千百万贫民的选举权。各州的居住年限限制使当局可以把季节性工人和被迫到各地寻找工作的失业者排斥于选民名单之外。
    十九个州的教育限制要求选民有英文知识和正确说明宪法的能力。这个条件剥夺掉受教育不多的人特别是许多工人和移民的投票权。
    美国现有的很高的年龄限制（公民要到二十一岁才有选举权）使相当大的一部分青年失掉参加选举的权利。
    此外，许多其他州的立法，都使当局可以专断地剥夺选民投票权。例如：在南部几个州里，要有“声望”才能有投票权。在佛蒙特州，要“举止温文尔雅”的人，才能列入选民名单。
    所有这些无理的限制使一大部分劳动人民不能投票。例如，在一九四八年的上一次总统选举中，有两千万达到选举年龄的人被剥夺掉选举权。据美联社估计，在本届选举中，这种数字要增加到二千五百万人，即占达到选举年龄的人数的四分之一。
    在美国，通常总是有一大部分选民不参加投票的。达到选举年龄的人只有半数左右参加选举。在一九四八年的总统选举中，已达选举年龄的人只有百分之五十参加投票，而在一九五零年的国会议员选举中，只有百分之四十强的选民参加投票。这种参加投票人数很少的情况，不仅是由于许多对普选权的限制造成的。这种情况也是美国劳动人民对于两党交换执政表示失望、对民主党及共和党总统候选人在他们竞选演说中慷慨激昂地提出的诺言表示不信任的结果。
