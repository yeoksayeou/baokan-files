The China Department Store East China Branch, in late September, comprehensively studied the rationalization proposals of its employees and created a new operating method for procurement, allocation, acceptance, and transportation—the high-speed gear operating method, transforming the past fragmented and disconnected operating methods into an organic and tightly organized one. The implementation of this operating method has not only accelerated commodity circulation but also reduced a large amount of commodity circulation costs.

The China Department Store East China Branch is responsible for supplying industrial products to the national state-owned department store system, with 220 units directly engaged in allocation and transportation tasks, transferring approximately 500,000 tons of goods annually. In the past, the company implemented an outdated document transfer system, which prevented the rapid circulation of goods. At that time, commodities had to go through complicated procedures from purchase to allocation. For example, after the purchasing department purchased a batch of goods, it would issue a five-copy "Purchase Order"; the allocation department would receive the purchasing department's "Purchase Report" before issuing a five-copy "Allocation Order" to handle allocation procedures; the transportation department would receive one copy of the "Allocation Order" from the allocation department before issuing a "Loading Order" to prepare for picking up and transporting the goods. This complex but unscientific document procedure often created a phenomenon of mutual waiting between departments, wasting manpower, materials, and time. At that time, it took at least five days for goods to be transferred from purchase to allocation. Due to the complexity of the documents, and the documents and goods not traveling together, the phenomenon of goods without documents or documents without goods often occurred (for example, if a shipping list had five types of goods, sometimes only four types were shipped for the convenience of vehicle allocation, and the shipping list was sent out as well, resulting in a mismatch between the documents and the goods for the receiving party; sometimes only one type of the five goods was shipped, and the shipping list could not be sent out, leaving the receiving party without documents), which prevented the receiving party from carrying out sales according to plan or from pricing for sale, affecting capital turnover.

After the start of the labor emulation drive, the company's leadership proposed the "Five Quicks" (quick purchase, quick allocation, quick transfer, quick transport, quick sale) to all employees, and all employees successively put forward more than 50 rationalization proposals to solve the "Five Quicks" problems. The trade union production committee assigned special personnel, organized several comrades familiar with the business, and absorbed five section chiefs from the administrative side to comprehensively study these rationalization proposals, formulate a draft of the new operating method, distribute it to relevant personnel for discussion, and solicit opinions from representatives of relevant agencies stationed in Shanghai. Finally, it was supplemented and revised to become a new set of operating methods. The characteristic of the new operating method is to organically connect all links related to the allocation and transportation of goods and organize a reasonable document flow route according to the business procedures. This involves merging the past "Purchase Order," "Allocation Order," and "Loading Order" into a set of six-copy forms. In this way, after the purchasing department purchases a batch of goods, it uniformly issues the six-copy form and distributes it to the relevant departments in a timely manner; each copy of the document represents a different nature at different circulation links. For example, the "Payment Voucher" copy, when sent to the inspection department by the purchasing department, serves as a receipt notification; when the inspection department approves it and sends it to the accounting department, it serves as a payment voucher; when the accounting department makes the payment, it uses it as a disbursement voucher, and after the payment is made, it serves as a sub-account page for purchased goods. Other documents are roughly similar. This not only simplifies the documents but also speeds up their circulation. Now, after the purchasing department purchases the goods and issues the documents, all aspects of the work can be carried out simultaneously: the manufacturer can deliver the goods, the transportation department can allocate vehicles and report taxes, and the inspection department and representatives of various department stores stationed in Shanghai can inspect the goods. These procedures can be completed simultaneously, and the goods can be picked up and loaded onto the vehicle immediately. In this way, goods can be received and loaded for shipment on the same day; the departments are also connected like gears.

The new operating method was created, but it encountered many difficulties in its implementation. Due to the acceleration of operations, the work of some departments became more tense than before, and some comrades felt that the work pressure was too great; the new operating method tightly linked the various business links, and the failure of one department to complete its task on time would inevitably affect the entire business, and some comrades were afraid of "falling behind"; some comrades did not see the power of subjective initiative and believed that implementing the new operating method was somewhat risky.

The company's administration and trade union issued a call, urging all employees to actively eliminate various ideological obstacles and resolutely implement the new operating method. In order to familiarize everyone with the content of the new operating method, the draft system was distributed to each department for study, and the main content of the new operating method was adapted into a living newspaper play. The trade union held various small-scale forums and conducted extensive publicity through blackboards, wall newspapers, and radios; it also adapted the new operating method and new operating procedures into quick-clapper rhymes according to the different needs of each department and section, so that everyone could memorize them. Through these methods, the comrades gained confidence in implementing the new operating method.

After the new operating method was implemented, it greatly reduced the time that goods were left idle. Most of the goods arriving on the same day could be shipped out on the same day. Due to the implementation of the "one good, one document" and "real goods, real documents" system, it was fully ensured that the shipping list followed the goods, guaranteeing that department stores in various locations received both the goods and the list simultaneously, allowing them to price and sell the goods in a timely manner, realizing the "Five Quicks" requirements of commodity circulation.

Within the first ten days of implementing this new operating method, the number of less-than-carload shipments was reduced from 40% to 35%. Based on this item alone, the company can save 5.6 billion yuan in interest and freight charges annually.

### 中国百货公司华东区公司创造新作业法  全面改进采购、调拨及运输的制度

    中国百货公司华东区公司创造新作业法
    全面改进采购、调拨及运输的制度
    中国百货公司华东区公司在九月下旬综合研究了职工的合理化建议，创造了一套采购、调拨、验收、运输的新作业法——高速轮齿作业法，把过去分散、脱节的作业法，变为有机的、组织严密的作业法。这一作业法实行后，不但加速了商品流转，而且减低了大批商品流转费用。
    中国百货公司华东区公司担负着供应全国国营百货系统的工业品的任务，辖有二百二十个直接担任调运任务的单位，每年调出商品达五十万吨左右。过去公司内部实行着一套落后的单据传递制度，使商品不能迅速流转。那时候，商品自购进到调出，要经过复杂的手续。例如，采购科购进一批货物后，开出一式五联的“采购单”；调拨科收到采购科的“采购报告单”，才开出一式五联的“调拨单”，办理调拨手续；运输科收到调拨科的一联
    “调拨单”，才能开“装运单”，准备提运货物。这种复杂的但不科学的单据手续，常使科与科之间形成互相等待的现象，浪费了人力、物力和时间。那时商品从购进至调出，至少要五天。由于单据复杂，单据和货物不同行，常常发生有货无单或有单无货的现象（如发货单上有五种货物，因配车方便，有时只运出四种，也把货单寄出去了，收货一方，单据和货物不符；有时五种货物只运出一种，货单不能发出，收货一方就没有单据），以致收货一方不能按计划进行推销，或无法标价出售，影响了资金周转。
    劳动竞赛开始以后，该公司领导方面向全体职工提出了“五快”（快购、快拨、快调、快运、快销）的号召，全体职工相继提出了五十多件关于解决“五快”问题的合理化建议。工会生产委员会抽出专人，组织了几个熟悉业务的同志，并吸收行政方面的五个科股长参加，综合研究了这些合理化建议，制订了新的作业法草案，发给有关人员讨论，并征求了各地有关机关驻上海代表的意见。最后加以补充修改，成为一套新的作业法。新作业法的特点是把有关调运商品的各个环节，有机地衔接起来，按照业务的程序，组织合理的单据流转路线。这就是把过去的“采购单”“调拨单”“装运单”合并成为一套六联单。这样，采购科在购进一批货物后，即统一开发六联单，及时分送有关各科；单据的每一联，在不同的流转环节上代表不同的性质。如“付款凭证”联，在采购科送给验保科时，即作为收货通知；验保科验讫送交会计科时，即作为付款凭证；会计科付款时，就把它作为支出传票，付出款项以后，就作为代购商品的分户帐页。其他单据也大致如此。这样不但使单据简化了，并加快了它的流转速度。现在采购科采购到货物发出单据以后，各方面的工作即可同时进行：厂商即可送货，运输科即可配车报税，验保科及各百货公司驻上海代表即可验货，这些手续同时办好，立即可以提货装车。这样，当天收货，当天可以装车启运；科和科之间也就轮齿般的衔接起来了。
    新的作业法产生了，但在实行中遇到了不少的困难。由于操作加速，使某些部门的工作较前紧张起来，部分同志感到工作的压力太大；新作业法把各个业务环节紧密衔接起来了，一个部门不能按时完成任务，势必影响整个业务的进行，有些同志害怕“掉队”了；还有一些同志看不到主观的力量，认为实行新作业法有些冒险。
    该公司的行政和工会发出号召，要求全体职工积极消除各种思想障碍，坚决实行新作业法。为了使大家熟悉新作业法的内容，特将制度草案发给各科进行学习，并将新作业法的主要内容编成活报剧演出。工会召开了各种小型座谈会，并通过黑板报、墙报、广播机等，进行广泛宣传；又把新的作业法和新的作业程序，按各科、股不同的需要，分别编成快板歌诀，让大家背诵。通过这些办法，使同志们对执行新作业法有了信心。
    新作业法实行后，大大地减少了商品搁置的时间。大部分当天到达的货物，当天就能运出了。由于实行了“一货一单”“实货实单”的制度，完全做到了发货清单跟商品走，保证了各地百货公司同时收到商品及清单，及时标价出售，实现百货流转的“五快”的要求。
    开始实行这一新作业法的十天内，就使零车货物从百分之四十减到百分之三十五。单以这一项计算，该公司全年即可节省资金利息及运费五十六亿元。
