A responsible person from the All-China Federation of Cooperatives discusses problems and solutions in cotton procurement:

Although supply and marketing cooperatives in various cotton-producing areas have overfulfilled the cotton procurement tasks for September, the enthusiasm of cotton farmers to sell cotton in various places is still increasing. At present, cooperatives in major cotton-producing areas are generally facing difficulties such as insufficient procurement funds, slow processing, and inadequate supply of materials. To this end, a Xinhua News Agency reporter specially interviewed a responsible person from the All-China Federation of Cooperatives to learn about the problems and solutions in cotton procurement across the country. The responsible person from the All-China Federation of Cooperatives first pointed out that this year, driven by the nationwide bumper harvest campaign, cotton sowing was earlier, fertilization increased, pest control was effective, cultivation techniques improved, rainfall was favorable, and especially because cotton farmers were organized. These factors have greatly increased cotton yield per unit area and promoted early cotton maturity. By late August, new cotton was generally available on the market in various places, breaking the usual rules of market volume and timing. In addition, cotton farmers have received patriotic education over the past year, and their political awareness has generally improved. The previous idea of waiting for higher prices before selling has turned into a wave of enthusiasm to sell cotton to the state. As a result, the procurement plans formulated by cooperatives in various places based on past cotton procurement patterns, as well as the preparations made according to the plans, have fallen behind actual needs. Under such circumstances, cooperatives in general cotton-producing areas have experienced difficulties such as insufficient procurement funds, slow processing, and inadequate supply of materials.

The responsible person went on to say: Currently, financial and economic departments and cooperatives in various places have taken effective measures to solve the problems encountered in procurement work. Cooperatives in various cotton-producing areas have now increased procurement funds. For example, Zhuoxian County Cooperative in Hebei Province increased its funding by more than 69 billion yuan in September. But this is not enough. The most important way to solve the problem of insufficient funds is to pay attention to strengthening and improving procurement, processing, and transportation work to accelerate capital turnover and meet the enthusiasm of the vast number of cotton farmers to sell cotton.

At present, cooperatives in various cotton-producing areas are paying attention to strengthening and improving this aspect of work. In addition, the practice of many grassroots cooperatives handling "deposit in kind and order goods" on behalf of cotton farmers is worthy of attention. In the Huimin Prefecture of Shandong Province in East China, cotton deposited by cotton farmers in Huimin and Qidong counties accounts for more than 50% of the total cotton purchased by the cooperatives. In Shandong Province, cotton farmers depositing cotton with cooperatives has generally become a movement. The Beizu Cooperative in Shahe County, Hebei Province, received a total value of over 23 million yuan in cotton in one day, with only 3 million yuan paid in cash. Cotton farmers ordered goods worth over 20 million yuan from the cooperative. This proves that the cooperative's handling of "deposit in kind and order goods" on behalf of cotton farmers is a good way to meet the needs of cotton farmers to sell large quantities of cotton, and it is worthy of promotion.

The responsible person also said: Regarding the processing of seed cotton, all localities should pay attention to tapping potential, because there is still great potential in various places. For example, some cotton purchasing stations of cooperatives in Shahe County, Hebei Province, have established a "cotton purchasing competition chain responsibility system" for cotton ginning, cotton processing, and bale tying, and while increasing the production of workers, they have also increased the wages of cotton ginning workers and improved workers' living and welfare facilities, preparing rolling stock parts for workers, so that they can concentrate on production. Thus, the enthusiasm of the competition has been consolidated, the quality of cotton has been guaranteed, and processing efficiency has been improved. In September and the first half of October, the county's cooperatives purchased more than 85% of the original plan. The lint delivered to the cotton yarn cloth company after processing accounted for 81% of the number collected during the same period. Mobilizing and utilizing all seed cotton processing potential to avoid backlog of seed cotton has become an important key for cooperatives in various places to accelerate capital turnover.

The responsible person finally said: In order to eliminate the crowding phenomenon of cotton farmers selling cotton and to meet the requirements of cotton farmers to sell cotton to the country, cooperatives in various places have, on the basis of the cotton pre-purchase contract implemented in the first half of this year, vigorously organized cotton farmers to sell cotton collectively. The Xiangcaiying Village Supply and Marketing Cooperative Cotton Purchasing Station in Hebei Province relied on party and government organs to educate cotton farmers to sell cotton collectively in groups, and required cotton farmers to report the numbers and times to the purchasing station in advance so that the purchasing station could purchase cotton in an organized and orderly manner. The Mao Yijian Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Pingyuan Province mobilized 160 cotton farmers from 35 mutual aid groups in five villages to collectively sell more than 39,000 kilograms of cotton, which saved cotton farmers 301 units of labor, and also increased the work efficiency of the cooperative by 1.4 times.

    全国合作社联合总社负责人
    谈收棉工作中的问题和解决的办法
    全国各棉产区的供销合作社虽已超额完成九月份收棉任务，但各地棉农售棉热潮仍有增无减，目前各产棉区合作社普遍发生收购资金不足，加工不及，物资供应不足等困难。为此，新华社记者特走访中华全国合作社联合总社负责人承告目前全国各地收棉工作中发生的问题和解决的办法。合作总社负责人首先指出：今年各棉产区在全国丰产运动的推动下，棉花播种提早，施肥增加，灭虫有效，培植技术提高，雨水调和，特别是棉农组织起来了等原因，使棉花单位面积产量大为增加，并促进了棉花提前成熟，至八月下旬各地新棉已普遍上市，冲破了往年上市量和时间的规律，加以一年来棉农受了爱国主义的教育，政治觉悟普遍提高，往年等价惜售思想变为踊跃把棉花卖给国家的热潮。这样就使各地合作社依据往年收棉规律订出的收购计划，以及根据计划进行的准备工作，都落后于实际需要。一般产棉区的合作社在这样的情况下就发生了收购资金不足，加工不及，物资供应不足等困难。
    负责人接着说：现各地财经部门和合作社已采取有效办法解决收购工作中发生的问题。各棉产区合作社现已增加了收购资金，如河北省涿县合作社九月份增筹资金达六百九十多亿元。但这是不够的，解决资金不足问题，最主要的还是注意加强改进收购、加工和运输等工作，以加速资金周转，迎接广大棉农出售棉花的热潮。
    现在各棉产区合作社正在注意加强和改进这一方面的工作。另外，各地不少基层合作社代棉农办理“存实订货”的作法值得重视。华东区山东省惠民专区的惠民、齐东两县棉农向合作社存棉占合作社收棉总数的百分之五十强。山东省棉农向合作社存棉一般已形成为运动了。河北省沙河县北俎合作社一天收棉总值二千三百多万元，付出现款仅三百万元。棉农把其余的二千多万元都向合作社订了货物。这就证明，合作社代棉农办理“存实订货”，是满足棉农大量出售棉花的好办法，它是值得提倡的。
    该负责人又说：关于籽棉加工问题，各地应注意发掘潜力，因为各地还存在着很大潜力。如河北省沙河县一些合作社的收棉站，因为订立了打花、轧花、扎包的“收棉竞赛连环负责制”，并在工人提高生产的同时，增加了打花工人的工资，改善了工人生活福利事业，为工人准备轧车零件，使他们安心生产，因而巩固了竞赛的积极性，保证了棉花的质量，提高了加工效率。九月份和十月上半月，全县合作社收购棉花超过原计划百分之八十五以上，经过加工送交花纱布公司的皮棉，占同期收进数的百分之八十一。动员和运用所有籽棉加工潜力，避免积压籽棉，已成为各地合作社加速资金周转的重要关键。
    负责人最后说：各地合作社为消除棉农售棉的拥挤现象，满足棉农把棉花卖给国家的要求，已在今年上半年实行棉花预购合同的基础上，大力组织棉农集体售棉。河北省香采营村供销合作社收棉站，依靠党政机关教育棉农小组集体售棉，并要求棉农提前把数字、时间报到收购站，以便收购站有组织有秩序地收购棉花。平原省毛仪涧供销合作社，发动五个村的三十五个互助组的一百六十户棉农，集体售棉三万九千多斤，就为棉农节省劳动力三百零一个，同时也使合作社的工作效率提高一点四倍。（新华社）
