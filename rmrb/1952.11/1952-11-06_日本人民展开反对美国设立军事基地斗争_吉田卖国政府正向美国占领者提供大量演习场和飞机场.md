Xinhua News Agency, November 5th: Tokyo dispatch: The Japanese people's struggle against the establishment of U.S. military bases is unfolding extensively throughout the country.

    In view of the fact that part of Uchinada Village, Kahoku County, Ishikawa Prefecture, has been requisitioned by the U.S. military as a military base, the Ishikawa Prefectural Assembly convened a plenary meeting on October 25th. The meeting unanimously passed a resolution opposing the requisition of Japanese farmland for military bases and demanding that the authorities concerned not establish military bases in Ishikawa Prefecture in the future. Representatives of people's organizations from various parts of Kyoto Prefecture held a meeting in Uji City demanding the removal of the military base in Minamiyamashiro, Kyoto Prefecture. In Shimoyama, Niigata Prefecture, farmers are fighting against the expansion of the U.S. military airfield.

    Japanese fishermen are also fighting against militarization. Since January of last year, the U.S. military has laid anti-submarine nets and densely deployed naval hydrophones in the vast waters of Tokyo Bay from Futtsu Gorge, Kimitsu County, Chiba Prefecture, to Mt. Kisaki, Kanagawa Prefecture. As a result, the local fish catch has been reduced by half, seriously threatening and disrupting the lives of 25,000 fishermen. On October 27th, approximately 300 representatives from fisheries unions in Chiba, Kanagawa, and Tokyo petitioned the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, demanding the complete removal of the U.S. military's anti-submarine nets. These representatives also made similar petitions to the Diet, the Ministry of Finance, and the Fisheries Agency.

    Xinhua News Agency, November 5th: Tokyo dispatch: The traitorous Yoshida government of Japan is providing the U.S. occupiers with a large number of military bases in accordance with the U.S.-Japan military base agreement signed in July.

    The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry of the Yoshida government announced on October 31st that ninety-seven sea, land, and air force training areas and airfields have been designated for use by the U.S. "Security Forces" starting at the end of October. In addition, according to Kyodo News, the military bases designated by the U.S. and Japanese authorities for use by the U.S. include: seventeen army training areas with a total area of more than 53,000 acres; thirty-four airfields with a total area of more than 33,900 acres; seventeen navy training areas; seventeen air force training areas; and seventeen shooting ranges with a total area of 283 acres.

    日本人民展开反对美国设立军事基地斗争
    吉田卖国政府正向美国占领者提供大量演习场和飞机场
    【新华社五日讯】东京消息：日本人民反对美国设立军事基地的斗争，正在全国各地广泛展开。
    鉴于石川县河北郡内滩村的一部分已被美军征用为军事基地，石川县县议会在十月二十五日召开了全体会议。会议一致通过决议，反对征用日本的农地为军事基地，并要求有关当局今后不在石川县设立军事基地。京都府各地人民团体的代表，曾在宇治市举行会议，要求撤除京都府南山城的军事基地。在新潟县下山地方，农民们正在为反对美军扩大飞机场而斗争。
    日本的渔民也在为反对军事基地化进行斗争。自从去年一月以来，美军在东京湾从千叶县君津郡富津峡起到神奈川县旗山崎止的广大水域中张设了防潜水艇网，并密布海军用听音器。当地获鱼量因而减少了一半，使二万五千渔民的生活受到严重的威胁和破坏。十月二十七日，千叶、神奈川和东京各地的渔业工会代表约三百人，到外务省请愿，要求完全撤除美军的防潜水艇网。这些代表并向国会、大藏省、水产厅进行了同样的请愿。
    【新华社五日讯】东京消息：日本吉田卖国政府正在根据七月间签订的美日军事基地协定，向美国占领者提供大量的军事基地。
    吉田政府农林省已在十月三十一日宣布，有九十七个海陆空军演习地区和飞机场，已决定首先从十月底起提供美国“保安部队”使用。此外，据共同社透露，经美国和日本当局决定由日本提供美国使用的军事基地已有：陆军演习地区十七个，面积总共为五万三千多英亩；飞机场三十四个，面积总共为三万三千九百多英亩；海军演习地区十七个；空军演习地区十七个；打靶场十七个，面积总共二百八十三英亩。
