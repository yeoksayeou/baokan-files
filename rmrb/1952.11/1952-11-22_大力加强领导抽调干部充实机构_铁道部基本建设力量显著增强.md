The restoration work of the People's Railways has basically concluded. Placing basic construction in a primary position has become the top priority task for the Ministry of Railways in the future. Before 1950, the main policy of railway work was to restore and strengthen old lines and improve the management of railways. After 1950, the People's Railways began to focus on constructing new railways. During the process of focusing on building new railways, the leading comrades of the Ministry of Railways deeply realized the complexity, arduousness, and importance of new line construction projects. Therefore, at the National Railway Engineering Conference in October of last year, Minister Teng Daiyuan emphasized that new line projects were equally important as old line management. At the meeting, the policy for new line construction projects in 1952 was determined: to organize construction, carry out design, prepare strength, and welcome larger railway construction tasks. After the meeting, the leadership of the Northwest Railway Trunk Line Engineering Bureau was adjusted, the on-site labor organization was improved, the policy of unity and transformation was persistently implemented among technical personnel, the democratic reform movement was launched, and the study of advanced Soviet experience was strengthened. In June of this year, at the National Railway Planning Conference, the Ministry of Railways, in accordance with the instructions of the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council, clearly put forward the policy of placing basic construction in a primary position and mobilized cadres and workers at all levels. After the June Planning Conference, the Ministry of Railways reviewed the shortcomings in the leadership of new line construction work over the past three years and took concrete measures to make new deployments.

    First, leadership was strengthened. A vice minister was assigned to be specifically responsible for leading new line projects, and three separate institutions, the Design Bureau, the New Line Construction Bureau, and the Basic Construction Bureau, were established. At each site, construction sub-bureaus, design sub-bureaus, and basic construction sub-bureaus were established, under the vertical leadership of the respective bureaus of the Ministry of Railways. The Design Bureau of the Ministry of Railways was established in early 1950. After the June conference this year, the institution was strengthened and the organization adjusted on the original basis. The New Line Construction Bureau was transformed from the former Engineering General Bureau, which both subcontracted and contracted projects. It is now a unit specifically contracting projects to concentrate efforts on improving labor organization, increasing productivity, reducing project costs, and improving project quality. The Basic Construction Bureau was established in September this year. The Basic Construction Bureau is the general contractor of basic construction in the railway system, controlling construction funds, responsible for project acceptance, and supervising the implementation of plans. This overcomes the shortcomings of "no supervision, inspection, or acceptance" in basic construction, ensuring that projects are "good, fast, and economical."

    Second, the strength of basic construction, especially the strength of surveying and design, was enriched and strengthened. To this end, a number of technical cadres from railway administrations across the country were transferred to new line construction posts. From June to the end of October this year, the number of technical cadres in the basic construction departments of the railway system increased by 50 percent, of which the number of surveying and design cadres increased by 80 percent. Eighty-one percent of the university graduates assigned to the railway system this year were transferred to work in basic construction. The machinery and equipment needed by the design departments have also been increased and adjusted. This has expanded the past ten surveying and design teams into four design sub-bureaus in the Northwest, Southwest, Northeast, and Central South, eighteen surveying and design teams, and one special design office. In terms of construction, the labor force and machinery and equipment have been strengthened, and the use of machinery has been fully utilized, so that new line construction is gradually moving towards mechanization and industrialization. At the same time, red flag competitions were launched among construction units, advanced construction methods continued to be promoted, labor organization was improved, and the Fengtai, Shenyang, and Shanhaiguan bridge factories in the railway system were centrally controlled directly by the New Line Construction Bureau. However, the number of basic construction cadres, especially technical cadres, is still far behind the requirements of future construction. Therefore, intermediate technical personnel training classes have been opened in the Northwest Railway Trunk Line Engineering Bureau and the Southwest Railway Engineering Bureau. The various bureaus of the Ministry of Railways have opened training classes for personnel in finance, accounting, mechanics, materials, and geological drilling in basic construction, and surveying and training classes will be established.

    Third, the close cooperation between design and construction has been strengthened to avoid the past phenomenon of separation between design and construction. This is to strictly schedule the design and construction periods and strengthen planning and preparation. Construction preparations are only made after the preliminary design is approved; formal construction is only started after the technical design documents are approved. In order to simplify the approval procedures for documents and ensure the correctness and rationality of the design, the Ministry of Railways established a Technical Appraisal Committee in August this year, which is specifically responsible for reviewing various design documents, standard drawings, and finalized design drawings. This also helps to change the situation where design lags behind construction. Fourth, the study of advanced Soviet experience and technical standards has been strengthened. After the "Three-Anti" movement, the enthusiasm of technical personnel for learning from the Soviet Union generally increased. The technical personnel of the Design Bureau of the Ministry of Railways established Soviet advanced experience learning groups for various businesses, and formulated a draft of engineering geological work in new line surveying and detailed rules for surveying and design according to the suggestions of Soviet experts. In terms of construction, based on Soviet construction experience and combined with the specific situation of Chinese railways, a corporate construction system was formulated, and "Interim Measures for New Line Construction" are being drafted, preparing for implementation next year. According to Soviet experts' suggestions, detailed rules for the work of the chief supervisor and supervisors have also been drafted to strengthen the inspection of construction and improve project quality. Advanced Soviet systems have also been adopted in engineering reports, statistics, scheduling, and other aspects. In addition, advanced Soviet experience has been adopted in design technical standards, various finalized design drawings, and technical operation methods. Fifth, political work in basic construction has been strengthened. In the grass-roots organizations of construction and design, the system of political commissars has been universally strengthened, and regular political work has been established. In early October, the Ministry of Railways designated cadres to participate in the central joint inspection team composed of the People's Supervision Committee of the Government Administration Council, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Labor, and other units, to inspect new lines in the Southwest; and dispatched a working group headed by Vice Minister Wang Shitai, composed of responsible cadres from the Party, administration, trade union, and Communist Youth League, and Soviet experts, to the Northwest Railway Trunk Line Engineering Bureau to systematically summarize the experience in various aspects of new line projects, and actively prepare for large-scale new line construction next year.

    大力加强领导抽调干部充实机构
    铁道部基本建设力量显著增强
    人民铁道的恢复工作已经基本结束。把基本建设放到首要地位，已经成了铁道部今后头等的任务。一九五○年以前，铁道工作的主要方针是恢复和加强旧路，改善铁路的经营管理。一九五○年以后，人民铁路开始重点的建设新铁路。在重点建设新铁路的过程中，铁道部领导同志深深体会到新路建设工程的复杂性、艰巨性和重要性，因而在去年十月全国铁路工程会议上，滕代远部长即强调指出，新线工程与旧线管理同等重要。会上，决定了一九五二年新路建设工程的方针：整理施工，开展设计，准备力量，迎接更大的铁路建设任务。会后，调整了西北铁路干线工程局的领导，改进了现场的劳动组织，在技术人员中间坚持贯彻了团结改造的方针，展开了民主改革运动，加强了苏联先进经验的学习。今年六月，全国铁路计划会议上，铁道部根据政务院财政经济委员会的指示，明确地提出了把基本建设放在首要地位的方针，并在各级干部和职工群众中进行了动员。六月计划会议以后，铁道部检查了三年来在新线建设领导工作中的缺点，并采取了具体措施，进行了新的部署。
    首先，加强了领导。由一位副部长专门负责领导新线工程，并成立设计局、新线施工局、基本建设局三个分立的机构。在各个现场分设施工分局、设计分局、基本建设分局，受铁道部各局垂直的领导。铁道部设计局，在一九五○年初即已成立，今年六月会议以后，更在原有基础之上，健全机构、调整组织。新线施工局，是由以往既发包工程又承包工程的工程总局改变的，它是专门承包工程的单位，以集中力量改善劳动组织，提高生产率，降低工程成本和提高工程质量。基本建设局是今年九月成立的。基本建设局，它是铁路系统中基本建设的总发包人，掌握工款，负责工程验收，监督计划的执行。这样就克服了基本建设中“没有监督、检查、验收”的缺点，保证了工程的“好、快、省”。
    其次，充实和加强了基本建设力量，特别是勘测设计的力量。为此，曾抽调了全国各铁路管理局的若干技术干部到新路建设岗位上去。从今年六月至十月底，铁路系统基本建设部门的技术干部增加了百分之五十，其中勘测设计的干部增加了百分之八十。今年分配到铁路系统中的高等学校毕业生，有百分之八十一调派到基本建设方面去工作。设计部门所需的机具装备也有了增加和调整。这样就使过去的十个勘测设计总队，扩大为西北、西南、东北和中南四个设计分局，十八个勘测设计总队，一个特种设计事务所。在施工方面，充实了劳动力和机具装备，充分发挥机械的使用力量，使新路施工逐步走向机械化和工厂化。同时展开了施工单位间的红旗竞赛，继续推广先进施工方法，改善劳动组织，并把铁路系统中的丰台、沈阳和山海关桥梁工厂，集中由新线施工局直接掌握。但是基本建设干部，特别是技术干部还远远落后于今后建设的要求。因此在西北铁路干线工程局和西南铁路工程局开办了中级技术人员训练班。铁道部内各局开办了基本建设中的财务、会计、机工、材料、地质钻探人员等训练班，并将成立勘测训练班。
    第三，加强设计与施工的紧密配合，避免以往设计与施工的脱节现象。这就是严格排定了设计与施工期限，加强计划性和准备工作。在初步设计批准后，才作施工准备；技术设计文件批准后，才正式开工。为了简化文件的批准手续，保证设计的正确性与合理性，铁道部在今年八月成立了技术鉴定委员会，专门负责审定各种设计文件，标准图和定型设计图等。这也有助于改变设计落后于施工的状况。第四，加强了对苏联先进经验和技术标准的学习。在“三反”运动之后，技术人员学习苏联的情绪普遍上涨。铁道部设计局的技术人员成立了各项业务的苏联先进经验学习小组，并按苏联专家的建议，制订了新线勘测中工程地质工作草案和勘测设计细则等。在施工方面，根据苏联的施工经验，结合中国铁路具体情况，制订了企业化的施工制度，并正在拟订“新线施工暂行办法”，准备明年推行。根据苏联专家建议，也拟定了总监察长及监察员的工作细则，以加强施工的检查工作，提高工程质量。在工程表报、统计、调度等各方面也采用了先进的苏联制度。其他在设计技术标准、各种定型设计图、技术作业方法等方面，也都采用了苏联的先进经验。第五，加强了基本建设中的政治工作。在施工和设计的基层组织中，普遍加强了政委制，建立了经常性的政治工作。十月初，铁道部指定干部参加了由政务院人民监察委员会、财政部、劳动部等单位组成的中央联合视察组，往西南检查新线；并派出了以王世泰副部长为首的以党、行政、工会、青年团的负责干部和苏联专家组成的工作组，往西北铁路干线工程局，有系统地总结新线工程中各个方面的经验，为明年大规模的新线建设，积极作了进一步的准备工作。
