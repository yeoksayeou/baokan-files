    Editor's Note: To celebrate the 35th anniversary of the great Soviet October Revolution, the people of our country will launch various activities related to Sino-Soviet friendship during the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month." This includes a large-scale exhibition of Soviet color films. The films to be exhibited include: "The Unforgettable Year 1919," "Gold Star Hero," "Donbas Miners," "Rural Doctor," "We Stand for Peace," "Soviet Colorful Animation Collection," and ten others. These films will be screened in 321 cinemas in 66 cities across the country. Starting today, this newspaper will publish reviews and introductions to these films.

    "The Unforgettable Year 1919," a new achievement in Soviet film art that won the Grand Prize at the 7th International Film Festival, will be screened in major cities in China. This is one of the films in the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month" Soviet color film exhibition. Chinese audiences will once again see the artistic images of the proletarian revolutionary teachers Lenin and Stalin in this film. At the same time, we will see the heroic spirit of the people united in their struggle against internal and external enemies after the founding of the young Soviet Republic.

    1919 was an unforgettable year. This was the year when the Soviet Republic was jointly attacked by imperialists from Britain, France, the United States, Japan, and internal Russian counter-revolutionaries. This collusion between the two forces against the Soviets had already formed in the first half of 1918. At this time, the First World War had ended, and the victorious imperialist group—the Entente—was dividing up the loot seized at the Paris Peace Conference; at the same time, they were also plotting to overthrow the Soviet regime and help the Russian landlords and capitalists restore their rule. The leadership center of this conspiracy was in London. In the summer of 1919, Churchill, the mortal enemy of the Soviet people, the mortal enemy of democratic peace and socialism, then the British Secretary of State for War, issued a rampant statement, saying that he had prepared a fatal blow to the Russian revolution; saying that when he had concentrated the necessary military supplies on the various borders of the Soviet Republic, he would begin the offensive of the "fourteen countries"; saying that he had drawn up a timetable for the occupation of Soviet cities, especially Petrograd (now Leningrad) and Moscow; and that he anticipated that by the New Year, the Soviets would be wiped out...

    However, as Lenin said, Churchill's "exaggeration is a bit too much." The working class and peasants of the Soviet Republic, in the struggle organized by the Bolshevik Party, in the struggle led by Lenin and Stalin, defended the fruits of the proletarian revolution, crushed the attacks of internal and external enemies, and the Soviet Republic finally won a glorious victory.

    The film "The Unforgettable Year 1919" portrays a historical fact during the period of foreign armed intervention and domestic war by the Bolshevik Party. Wherever the enemy threatened the lives of the Soviet people, wherever danger threatened the most important and central places in the country, Stalin appeared, and the Red Army won victory. From this film, we can deeply understand a truth: Where Stalin is, there is victory!

    In 1919, Churchill sent a fleet to invade the Baltic Sea, and organized the bourgeois rebellion organization "National Center" in the city of Petrograd. The White bandit army of Rozhanko, commanded by Tsarist General Yudenich, approached the gate of Petrograd with the help of British imperialists. Traitors in the city and British agents became active. Some former Tsarist officers were still retained in the newly established Red Army. Some of them were traitors who were bent on restoring the old regime and colluded with British imperialists. Butkiewicz, the commander of the Kronstadt artillery, was such a despicable and shameful lackey. On the one hand, Butkiewicz ordered Nikolai Neklyudov, the commander of the Red Hill Fortress, to defect and open the way to Petrograd for the White Guard bandit army of Rozhanko. On the other hand, he arranged for his wife and the "National Center" to riot in the city, vainly attempting to capture Petrograd from within and without.

    At this time, the Soviet socialist motherland was in danger. Under such a serious situation, the Trotskyites, who held a leading position in Petrograd, actually issued orders to destroy factories in the city and sink warships at sea, preparing to withdraw from Petrograd and give way to the enemy. At that time, on Lenin's proposal, Stalin was sent to Petrograd to eliminate the serious danger hanging over their heads.

    Anyone who can accurately judge the enemy's movements, timely organize his own forces, and determine the main direction of attack, is tantamount to predetermining eight or nine out of ten of the entire war's fate. This is the strategic task set by Lenin and Stalin throughout the period of foreign armed intervention and domestic war. "The Unforgettable Year 1919" shows the strategic tasks of Lenin and Stalin. Stalin, standing with Lenin, is the inspirer and organizer of the Red Army's victory. Because Stalin came to Petrograd, with his calmness and determination, agility and wisdom, and amazing insight, he quickly became aware of the instability of some officers and the counter-revolutionary conspiracies in the city. Stalin pointed out that the reason why the White Guard bandits were approaching Petrograd was the Red Army's lack of strong command, the lack of political selection of troops, and the presence of dissidents in the rear. Stalin pointed out the enemy's weaknesses: "This Rozhanko, he has no rear, no manpower replenishment, no food and grass, an army like this cannot last long. Unless unexpected events occur within us."

    Therefore, relying on the working class of Petrograd, who had made many contributions in the past revolutionary struggles, Stalin smashed the "National Center" in the city with lightning speed, arrested a large number of reactionary dukes and Tsarist generals, including the wife of Butkiewicz, who was plotting the rebellion. On the other hand, under Stalin's direct command, the Baltic Fleet drove away the British fleet that had infiltrated the sea, and suppressed the resistance of the rebel soldiers of the Red Hill Fortress with fierce artillery fire. Then the sailors landed, occupied the Red Hill Fortress, and killed the British agents hidden in the fortress.

    At this time, the conspirators gathered in London shouted in despair: "This is terrible! What to do?"

    At this time, Stalin, standing at the Red Hill Fortress, said: "Comrades, now, we must turn our artillery fire to fight the enemy and drive them out of our territory."

    Thanks to Stalin's brilliance and his great revolutionary organizational talent, the counter-revolutionary conspiracy in the city of Petrograd was quickly exposed and suppressed; the military situation on the front lines was reversed. The great leader's firm will to defeat the enemy became an inexhaustible source of spiritual strength for the Red Army. This is the central idea that runs through the entire film.

    What the leader gives to the masses is inspiration, great organizational ability, and the masses support the leader, they support the Party. Excellent Party members, advanced workers, and heroic sailors all stand at the forefront of the struggle. This film correctly depicts the relationship between the leader and the masses. Only when the leader correctly concentrates the wishes and demands of the masses, is the leader trusted and supported by the masses. In this film, there is a representative of the masses, a sailor, who is also the protagonist of the film—Shibaev, who says: "We can only think about one thing now—how to win. We can't think about anything else." This is exactly the wish and demand of the working masses at that time. The leaders and the masses are united on this common wish and demand, defending the birthplace of the October Revolution—Petrograd. This is also an important idea that runs through the entire film.

    This is not an ordinary historical film, nor is it an ordinary biographical film, but an epic of the great struggle of the Soviet people under the leadership of Lenin and Stalin. The film perfectly depicts the revolutionary genius leader, and also truthfully records the feelings, wishes and demands of the Soviet people. Because this film is rich in high ideological and artistic value, it helps us Chinese people to more intimately understand the true face of the Soviet people's struggle.

    Following the teachings of Lenin and Stalin, the Soviet working class and peasants united to overcome various difficulties in the country and built a socialist society under the conditions of capitalist encirclement. The possibility of the victory of socialism in a single country has become a reality in the Soviet Union. Today, under the leadership of the Communist Party and Comrade Stalin, the Soviet people are successfully carrying out the glorious task of gradually transitioning from socialism to communism. However, Stalin taught us that "any economic victory, no matter how great, cannot cancel the fact of capitalist encirclement and the consequences arising from this fact." ("On the shortcomings of Party work and the methods of eliminating Trotskyite double-dealers and other double-dealers") This sentence alerts the Soviet people and also alerts the Chinese people who have just achieved revolutionary victory.

    The film "The Unforgettable Year 1919" tells us that the Soviet people defeated foreign armed intervention, but did not eliminate the danger of new armed intervention. The Soviet Great Patriotic War from 1941 to 1945 was when the Soviet people, under Stalin's leadership, defeated the attack of Fascist Germany. To this day, the war camp headed by US imperialism still refuses to learn from historical lessons, clamoring to launch a war against the Soviet Union, China, and the people's democratic countries, but their fate has been prescribed by history.

    The film "The Unforgettable Year 1919" gives Chinese audiences unlimited confidence and strength. Like the Soviet people, we Chinese people, since we can achieve victory, can defend the fruits of victory; like the Soviet people, since we have defeated the enemy, we can crush any counter-revolutionary activities that infiltrate our country; finally, like the Soviet people, we have made significant contributions to world peace, and will continue to defend world peace. We firmly believe that the power of peace will surely be able to crush the conspiracy of war. (Attached picture)

    斯大林在哪里，哪里就有胜利！
    ——苏联彩色影片“难忘的一九一九年”观后
    陈翰伯
    编剧：维什涅夫斯基、齐阿乌列里、费里孟诺夫  总导演：齐阿乌列里
    荣膺列宁勋章之莫斯科电影制片厂一九五二年出品  东北电影制片厂一九五二年译制
    编者按：为庆祝伟大的苏联十月革命三十五周年，我国人民在“中苏友好月”内，将展开有关中苏友好的各种活动。其中包括举行一次大规模的苏联彩色影片展览。展览的影片有：“难忘的一九一九年”“金星英雄”“顿巴斯矿工”“乡村医生”“我们坚持和平”“苏联五彩动画集锦”等十部。这些影片将在全国六十六个城市的三百二十一家电影院放映。本报从今天起将陆续发表对这些影片的评介文章。
    荣膺第七届国际电影节特等奖的、苏联电影艺术的新成就“难忘的一九一九年”将在中国各大城市放映了。这是“中苏友好月”苏联彩色电影片展览中的一部影片。中国观众将在这部影片里再一次地看见无产阶级革命导师列宁和斯大林的艺术形象。同时，我们将看见年青的苏维埃共和国成立以后，人民团结一致对内外敌人作斗争的英雄气概。
    一九一九年是难忘的一年。这是苏维埃共和国遭到英、法、美、日等帝国主义者和俄国内部反革命分子联合进攻的一年。这两种反对苏维埃势力的勾结，早在一九一八年上半年就已经形成。这时候，第一次世界大战已经结束，战胜了的帝国主义集团——协约国正在巴黎和会上瓜分掠夺到手的赃物；同时，它们也在阴谋推翻苏维埃政权，帮助俄国的地主和资本家复辟。这个阴谋的领导中心是在伦敦。一九一九年夏天，苏维埃人民的死敌、民主和平与社会主义的死敌、当时的英国陆军部部长邱吉尔发表了狂妄的声明，说他已经准备了对俄国革命的致命打击；说当他在苏维埃共和国各处边界上集中了必要的军需品以后，便要开始“十四国”军队的进攻；说他已经制定了占领苏维埃各城市、特别是彼得格勒（即现在的列宁格勒）和莫斯科的日程表；还说他预料到新年时，苏维埃将会被消灭……
    然而，正如列宁所说，邱吉尔的“这种夸大未免有点过分”。苏维埃共和国的工人阶级和农民，在布尔什维克党所组织的斗争中，在列宁和斯大林所领导的斗争中，保卫了无产阶级革命的果实，粉碎了内外敌人的进攻，苏维埃共和国终于获得了光荣的胜利。
    影片“难忘的一九一九年”所表现的就是布尔什维克党在外国武装干涉和国内战争时期的一段历史事实。凡是敌人威胁着苏维埃人民生命的地方，凡是危险威胁着国内最重要、最中心的地方，便有斯大林出现，而红军也就获得了胜利。从这部影片里，我们可以深刻地体会到一个真理：斯大林在哪里，哪里就有胜利！
    一九一九年，邱吉尔派了一支舰队侵入波罗的海海面，在彼得格勒城内组织了资产阶级的叛乱组织“民族中心”。沙皇将军尤登尼奇所指挥的罗将科的白匪军队，在英帝国主义者的援助之下，已经逼近彼得格勒的门口。城内的叛徒和英国的特务都纷纷活动起来。刚刚建立起来的红军中还保留着一些旧日沙皇的军官。其中有些是一心妄想恢复旧政权、并且和英帝国主义者有所勾结的叛徒。喀琅施塔得炮兵司令布特凯维奇就是这么一只卑鄙可耻的走狗。布特凯维奇一方面命令红山炮台司令尼柯来·涅克留多夫叛变，为白卫匪军罗将科开辟通往彼得格勒的道路，一方面布置他自己的老婆和“民族中心”在城内暴动，妄想里应外合攻占彼得格勒。
    这时，苏联社会主义祖国处在危急中。就在这种严重的情势之下，彼得格勒方面居领导地位的托派分子，竟然发出命令，一面在城内炸毁工厂，一面在海面凿毁军舰，准备撤出彼得格勒，给敌人让开道路。当时，按照列宁的提议，斯大林被派到彼得格勒去消灭悬在头顶上的严重危险。
    凡是能够准确地判断敌人的动向，把自己一方的力量适时地组织起来，并且规定了主要的打击方向，就等于预先决定了整个战争命运的十之八九。在整个外国武装干涉和国内战争时期，列宁和斯大林所规定的战略任务就是如此。“难忘的一九一九年”表现了列宁和斯大林的战略任务。和列宁站在一起的斯大林是红军胜利的鼓舞者和组织者。由于斯大林来到了彼得格勒，以他的镇静和坚决，机敏和智慧，以及惊人的洞察力，迅速地警觉到军官中的某些不稳和城内的反革命阴谋。斯大林指出白卫匪军逼到彼得格勒的原因是红军缺乏坚强的指挥，部队成员没有经过政治选择以及后方有异己分子。斯大林指出敌人的弱点：“这个罗将科，他没有后方，没有人力补充，没有粮草，像这样的军队是不能支持多久。假若我们内部不发生意外的事变。”
    于是斯大林依靠着在过去几次革命斗争中做过许多贡献的彼得格勒工人阶级，以迅雷不及掩耳的手段粉碎了城内的“民族中心”，逮捕了大批反动公爵和沙皇将军，包括阴谋叛乱的布特凯维奇的老婆在内。另一方面，在斯大林的直接指挥之下，波罗的海舰队逐退了潜入海面的英国舰队，并且以猛烈的炮火压住了红山炮台叛兵的抵抗，接着水兵登陆作战，占领了红山炮台，并且打死了暗藏在炮台中的英国特务。
    这时，聚集在伦敦的阴谋家失魂落魄地喊道：“这多可怕呀！怎么办呢？”
    这时，站在红山炮台的斯大林说：“同志们，现在，我们要转过炮口去打敌人，把他们从我们国土上赶出去。”
    由于斯大林的英明和他的伟大的革命组织才能，使彼得格勒城内的反革命阴谋很快被揭露和镇压下去；前线的军事状况被扭转过来。伟大领袖对于击败敌人的坚强意志，成为红军精神力量的取之不尽的泉源。这是贯穿在全部影片中的中心思想。
    领袖给予群众的是鼓舞，是伟大的组织能力，而群众是拥护领袖的，是拥护党的。优秀的党员、先进的工人和英勇的水兵都站在斗争的最前线。这部影片正确地描写了领袖与群众的关系。只有当领袖正确地集中了群众的愿望和要求的时候，领袖才是被群众所信任、所拥戴的。在这部影片里，有一个群众的代表，他是个水兵，也是本片的主角——什巴耶夫说：“我们现在只能想一个问题——怎么能胜利。不能想别的。”这正是当时劳动群众的愿望和要求。领导和群众就是在这个共同的愿望和要求之上结合起来，保卫了十月革命的诞生地——彼得格勒的。这也是贯穿在全部影片中的一个重要思想。
    这不是一部通常的历史影片，也不是一部通常的传记影片，而是一部在列宁和斯大林领导之下的苏维埃人民伟大斗争的叙事诗。影片完美地描写了革命的天才领袖，也翔实地纪录了苏维埃人民的感情、愿望和要求。由于这部影片富有很高的思想性和艺术性，它就帮助我们中国人民更亲切地认识了苏维埃人民斗争的真实面貌。
    遵循着列宁和斯大林的学说，苏联的工人阶级和农民联合起来已经克服了国内的各种困难，在资本主义包围的条件下建成了社会主义社会。社会主义在单独一国内胜利的可能性已经在苏联成为现实了。今天，苏联人民正在共产党和斯大林同志的领导之下，顺利地执行着从社会主义逐渐过渡到共产主义的光荣任务。然而，斯大林教导我们，苏联国内“任何经济上的胜利，不管它们如何伟大，决不能取消资本主义的包围这一事实以及从这一事实所发生的结果。”（“论党工作的缺点和消灭托洛茨基两面分子及其他两面分子的办法”）这句话警惕着苏联人民，也警惕着刚刚取得革命胜利的中国人民。
    影片“难忘的一九一九年”告诉我们，苏联人民打败了外国武装干涉，并没有消灭新的武装干涉的危险。一九四一年到一九四五年的苏联伟大的卫国战争，就是苏联人民在斯大林领导下，击败了法西斯德国的进攻。直到今天，以美帝国主义为首的战争阵营，还是不肯吸取历史的教训，叫嚣着要对苏联、中国和各人民民主国家发动战争，但他们的命运是为历史所规定了的。
    影片“难忘的一九一九年”给予中国观众以无限信心和力量。中国人民和苏联人民一样，我们既然能够取得胜利，就能够保卫胜利的果实；我们和苏联人民一样，既然打败了敌人，就能够粉碎任何潜入我国内部的反革命活动；最后，我们和苏联人民一样，我们已对世界和平作了重大贡献，更将继续保卫世界和平，我们深信和平的力量一定能够粉碎战争的阴谋。（附图片）
