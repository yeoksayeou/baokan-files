The First Group of Female Pilots of New China
Determined to Work Hard to Develop the Motherland's Aviation Industry

Respected Chairman Mao: We are the first group of female pilots of New China. We deeply feel the happiness of being born in the Mao Zedong era and the glory of being a fighter in the Chinese People's Air Force! Whenever we perform a mission and land at any airport, there are always many comrades looking at us with envious and hopeful eyes. When we walk down the street or appear in public, people always greet us warmly and enthusiastically. We often receive thousands of letters from all over the motherland, containing the care and advice of elders, the kind greetings of young people, and the determination expressed by many young women – that they will also become glorious people's pilots in the future. Whenever we receive these letters, we think: This is the glory that you, respected Chairman Mao, have given us.

"Organize to complete tasks and constantly strive to pave the way for women in New China to engage in the aviation industry." This is how the Party teaches us. Respected Chairman Mao! We report to you: We have not disappointed the Party's expectations of us. Under the leadership of the Party and higher authorities, we have gradually improved our technical, political, and cultural level through practical work in the past six months. We have overcome severe cold, scorching heat, and all difficulties, completed various training tasks, and mastered complex aviation technology. Now we are able to fly through clouds, and we can also persist in long-distance flights even in poor airflow or difficult operating conditions. We have formed a team and gloriously joined the work of the Chinese People's Air Force. Recently, we also completed the flight missions given to us by the motherland. In other work and in every movement, we have not fallen behind. In terms of caring for equipment, every comrade in our team cherishes the aircraft as they cherish their own eyes: In summer, when the wings are so hot that they can burn ants to death, we wipe them down with sweat; on windy and rainy nights, we brave the wind and rain to go to the airport to maintain the aircraft. In the movement to rectify military discipline and internal order, we have been praised several times by the leaders of our unit.

Chairman Mao! We know that our current achievements are still far from meeting the needs of the motherland, and we must work harder to learn and continue to improve our professional level in order to undertake the glorious task of building a great motherland. Respected Chairman Mao! At this time when the motherland's large-scale economic construction is about to arrive, we assure you: We will definitely not be arrogant or impetuous, humbly study our profession, improve work efficiency, and work a hundred times harder to develop the motherland's aviation industry and build a prosperous and strong New China!

    新中国第一批女航空员
    决心为发展祖国航空事业而努力
    敬爱的毛主席：我们是新中国第一批女航空员。我们深深感到生长在毛泽东时代的幸福和做一个中国人民空军战士的光荣！每当我们执行任务降落在任何一个机场时，周围总有好多同志用羡慕和希望的眼光看着我们。当我们走在街头或出现在群众场合时，人们总是向我们亲切地、热烈地欢呼。我们经常接到成千成万来自祖国四面八方的信件，里面有长者的关怀嘱咐；有少年们的亲切问候；还有很多女青年向我们表示的决心——她们将来也要当一个光荣的人民航空员。每当接到这些来信时，我们就想：这是您，敬爱的毛主席，给我们的光荣。
    “组织起来完成任务，为开辟新中国妇女从事航空事业的道路而不断努力。”党这样教导着我们。敬爱的毛主席！我们向您报告：我们没有辜负党对我们的期望。我们在党和上级的领导下，半年来，从实际工作中，逐渐提高了技术、政治、文化水平。我们战胜了严寒酷暑和一切困难，完成了各种训练任务，掌握了复杂的航空技术。现在我们已经能够穿云飞行；在气流不好或操纵困难的条件下，也能坚持长途飞行。我们已经编了队，光荣地参加了中国人民空军的工作。最近，我们还完成了祖国给予我们的飞行任务。在其他工作上和每个运动中，我们也没有落在后边。在爱护器材方面，我们全队每个同志爱护飞机都像爱护自己的眼珠一样：夏天，机翼热得能烫死蚂蚁，我们流着大汗去擦洗它；在大风大雨的夜间，我们冒着风雨的吹打，也要奔赴机场去维护飞机。在整顿军风纪、整顿内务秩序运动中，我们受到过本单位首长的几次表扬。
    毛主席！我们知道：我们现在的成绩距离祖国的需要还很远，必须加倍努力学习，继续提高业务水平，才能担当起建设伟大祖国的光荣任务。敬爱的毛主席！在此祖国大规模经济建设即将到来的时候，我们向您保证：一定不骄不躁、虚心钻研业务，提高工作效率，为发展祖国的航空事业，为建设繁荣富强的新中国而百倍努力！
    新中国第一批女航空员全体同志
