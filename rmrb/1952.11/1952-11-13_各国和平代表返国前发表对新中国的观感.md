(Report from our newspaper) Comprehensive Xinhua News Agency report: Before returning to their countries, delegates from various countries who attended the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference have successively expressed their views on New China.

    The head of the Ceylon delegation, Narawila Damaratana, said: "On October 1st, we had the honor of witnessing the peaceful parade of the great National Day, when hundreds of thousands of people marched before their great leader, Chairman Mao. Seeing this parade, we not only felt the Chinese people's desire for peace, but also their strong determination to fight for peace. We have visited villages, factories, sanatoriums, workers' clubs, universities, etc. in Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Hankou and Guangzhou. We have seen the great progress made by the Chinese people in just three years. We are particularly moved by the People's Government's care for the welfare of the working people. I have no doubt about the lofty position of the Chinese working class in the new society. The greater peaceful construction plans in the coming years will bring more happiness to the Chinese people every year. We know that this is why the Chinese people most desire peace."

    He continued: "We must loudly proclaim a great truth in public: what the Chinese people most desire is peace. As a Buddhist disciple, I would also like to tell my fellow believers that Buddhism is highly respected in China, and all rumors about religious repression and lack of religious freedom are false. I would also like to tell my people that I have visited several temples and not only have I seen that all religious groups have freedom, but I have also personally seen the government assisting in the repair of temples."

    The head of the Syrian and Lebanese delegation, Sheikh Muhammad Taha al-Achmar, said in a written statement: "We came from the Arab countries to Beijing, the capital of China, and completed the work of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference. We saw the celebrations of the Chinese armed forces and people on the Chinese National Day. We visited historical palaces, factories and rural areas in various places, and we felt that China's industry, agriculture and culture have made great progress. When we visited the countryside, we talked to the farmers and asked them about their situation. They replied:
    'We used to suffer from persecution, poverty and hunger. We and our children used to eat bran and leaves, and our children died of cold and starvation due to lack of food and clothing; but now we have been reborn, we are very prosperous and free.' This is what we saw and heard in the suburbs of Beijing. When we visited cities such as Shanghai, Hangzhou, and Wuxi in East China, we saw that the people there were prosperous, happy, and healthy, and that industry and agriculture had made remarkable progress. Although our bodies have left China today, our hearts are linked with the Chinese people."

    Dr. Gyan Chand, Deputy Head of the Indian Delegation, and Louis Alley, Deputy Head of the New Zealand Delegation, expressed their views on New China before leaving Shanghai. Dr. Chand said: "China's Huai River project is not only a great success in terms of technology, but also of inestimable benefit to the entire Chinese people. It has saved millions of people from floods." Louis Alley said: "After seeing this large-scale Huai River project, each of our representatives has more clearly realized that the Chinese people love peace. Because a country preparing for a war of aggression would not and could not engage in such construction." Diego Montaña Cuéllar, head of the Colombian delegation, said in a written statement: "A French poet said: 'Sadness, only parting.' Leaving Beijing undoubtedly makes me feel sad, but when I leave such good friends as the Chinese friends, I feel a hundred times more courageous to fight for peace. We are no longer peace representatives, but peace warriors."

    U Bo Din, Deputy Head of the Burmese Delegation, said: "In the past four weeks, we have had the opportunity to see with our own eyes what the People's Government means. We have seen farmers in the countryside and workers in the city. Now, we understand that the People's Government means the happiness and joy of the people. They are satisfied with the present and full of firm will and hope for the future.

    The closing scene of the Peace Conference left an indelible impression on my mind. It was already three o'clock in the morning, and the early-rising rooster must have begun to crow, but the representatives were still happily clapping their hands to the rhythm of Chinese music, and boys and girls were happily jumping, singing, and throwing flowers in the conference hall. The crisp Chinese words of boys and girls 'Long live peace' and the deep cheers of adults from Western countries rose and fell one after another. The whole scene moved me like never before. My legs were shaking and tears were streaming down my face. These tears were not tears of sadness, but tears of joy and victory. Peace must triumph! Long live peace!"

    Pakistan representative Hai said: "In China, I saw a vigorous force in the Chinese people. It is a remarkable miracle: New China has gotten rid of the devastation and destruction caused by Japanese imperialism, American imperialism and their running dogs, the Kuomintang, and established a new life. Factories and machines have been repaired, new factories have been established, past production records have been broken, new production methods are constantly being discovered, workers' lives have been greatly improved, and houses are being built on a large scale. Labor insurance guarantees the welfare of workers. All of this proves that New China is wholeheartedly committed to peaceful construction. The elimination of feudalism has enabled farmers to obtain land and establish mutual aid groups, changing the entire lives of farmers. The Huai River project vividly proves that human labor can conquer and transform nature. The desire for knowledge is so universal, the care for children is so great, and women and men participate in national life side by side."

    Finally, Hai expressed his gratitude to the Chinese people for their efforts to defend peace.

    各国和平代表返国前发表对新中国的观感
    【本报讯】综合新华社消息：出席亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的各国代表们，于返国前纷纷发表对新中国的观感。
    锡兰代表团团长那拉威拉·达马拉塔纳说：“十月一日，我们荣幸地看到伟大的国庆节的和平游行，当时有数十万人民在他们的伟大领袖毛主席的面前行进。看到了这个游行，我们不仅体会到中国人民对和平的热望，并且还体会到他们愿为和平而战斗的坚强决心。我们曾经访问了北京、天津、上海、汉口和广州的乡村、工厂、疗养院、工人俱乐部、大学等等。我们看到了中国人民在短短的三年中所获得的巨大进步。人民政府对劳动人民福利的照顾，使我们特别感动。我毫不怀疑中国工人阶级在新社会中的崇高地位。未来几年的更伟大的和平建设计划，每一年都将给中国人民带来更多的幸福。我们知道这就是为什么中国人民最渴望和平的原因。”    
    他接着说：“我们一定要在公开场所大声疾呼地宣扬一个伟大的真理：中国人民所最渴望的就是和平。作为一个佛门弟子，我还要告诉我的教友们，佛教在中国极受尊重，关于压制宗教和没有信教自由的一切谣传都是假的。我还要告诉我国人民：我已经参观过好几处寺庙，不仅亲眼看到一切宗教团体都有自由，而且亲眼看到政府在协助修理寺院。”
    叙利亚和黎巴嫩代表团团长契克·穆哈默德·塔哈—阿契玛尔发表书面谈话说：“我们从阿拉伯国家来到中国的首都北京，完成了亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的工作，在中国国庆节日看到了中国的武装部队和人民的狂欢。我们参观了历史的宫殿，参观了各地的工厂和农村，我们觉得中国的工业、农业和文化都有伟大的发展。当我们访问农村时，曾经和农民们谈话，问过他们的情况，他们回答说：
    ‘我们曾经遭受着迫害、贫穷和饥饿。我们和我们的孩子那时吃过麦麸、树叶，我们的孩子曾因缺乏衣食冻馁而死；但现在我们已经获得了新生，我们是很富裕而且自由了。’这是我们在北京郊区的所见所闻。在我们访问华东区上海、杭州、无锡等城市时，见到那里的人民富裕、快乐、健康，工业农业都有显著的进步。今天虽然我们的身体离开了中国，但我们的心是和中国人民联在一起的。”
    印度代表团副团长杰安·昌德博士和新西兰代表团副团长路易·艾黎在离沪前，发表对新中国的观感。昌德博士说：“中国的治淮工程，不仅在技术方面有着伟大成功，而且对整个中国人民来说，是有着无可估价的利益。它使千百万人民从水灾中被挽救出来。”路易·艾黎说：“我们看到了这一规模宏大的淮河工程后，使我们每个代表更加明确地认识了中国人民是热爱和平的。因为一个准备侵略战争的国家，是不会，也不可能从事这样的建设的。”哥伦比亚代表团团长迪埃哥·蒙塔尼亚·库艾拉发表书面谈话说：“一个法国诗人说过：‘黯然神伤，唯别而已’。离开北京无疑使我感到难过，但是当我离开的是像中国朋友这样的好朋友时，我又感到有百倍的勇气为和平而斗争。我们已不再是和平代表，而是和平战士了。”
    缅甸代表团副团长宇伯登发表谈话说：“在过去四个星期里面，我们有机会亲眼看到人民政府意味着什么。我们看到了乡村中的农民和城市中的工人。现在，我们了解到：人民政府意味着人民的幸福和欢欣，他们对现在感到满意，而对将来充满了奋斗的坚定意志和希望。
    和平会议的闭幕情景在我的脑子里留下不可磨灭的印象。已经是早晨三点钟了，早起的雄鸡一定已经开始报晓，然而代表们还在快乐地随着中国音乐拍着手，男孩子和女孩子在会议大厅里愉快地跳跃着、歌唱着，抛着鲜花。男女孩子的清脆的中国话‘和平万岁’和西方国家代表的成年人的深沉的欢呼声此起彼落。整个场面使我受到从未有过的感动。我的腿在颤动着，眼泪从脸上流下来。这些眼泪不是悲伤的眼泪，而是快乐和胜利的眼泪。和平一定战胜！和平万岁！”
    巴基斯坦代表哈伊说：“在中国，我看到中国人民有一种生气勃勃的力量。这是一个了不起的奇迹：新中国已经摆脱了日本帝国主义、美国帝国主义和它们的走狗国民党所造成的摧残与破坏而建立起新的生活。工厂和机器已经修好，新的工厂已建立起来，过去的生产纪录都被打破了，新的生产方法不断地被发现，工人的生活已大大改善，房屋在大规模建造，劳动保险保障了工人的福利，这些都证明新中国是一心一意致力于和平建设的。封建制度的消灭，使农民分得了土地，建立了互助组，改变了整个农民的生活。淮河工程生动地证明了人的劳动是可以征服和改造自然的。求知的欲望是那样普遍，对儿童是那样关怀，妇女和男人并肩地参加国家生活。”
    哈伊最后对中国人民为保卫和平的努力，表示感谢。
