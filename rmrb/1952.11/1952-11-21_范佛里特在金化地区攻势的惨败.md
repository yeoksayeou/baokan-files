	Van Fleet's Disastrous Offensive in the Kimhwa Area
	Xinhua News Agency Reporters Zhang Jie and Shi Feng
	In the Sangkumryung area north of Kimhwa in the central Korean front, there are two small hills—Hill 537.7 North and Hill 597.9, which are our army's forward positions guarding Mount Osong. For more than a month, a unit of our army has continuously repelled the frenzied attacks of two divisions of the U.S.-ROK (Republic of Korea) bandit army, annihilating more than 20,000 enemy troops.
	Starting in September of this year, the enemy suffered heavy blows from our army along the 200-kilometer front in Korea. Especially on October 6th, our army launched counterattacks simultaneously in many areas on the western, central, and eastern fronts, capturing 21 enemy hill positions in one fell swoop, including positions fortified with strong fortifications and held by two battalions of the U.S.-ROK bandit army. In order to cover up its series of defeats on the Korean battlefield, the American aggressors concentrated the entire strength of the U.S. 7th Division, the ROK 2nd Division, and part of the ROK 9th Division, and also concentrated all the mobile artillery units of the U.S. 8th Army, sending out a large number of tanks and aircraft, and launched a frenzied attack on the forward positions defended by two companies of our army—Hill 537.7 North and Hill 597.9. Van Fleet, the executioner with his hands stained with the blood of the Korean people, personally inspected and deployed this frenzied offensive in advance, and then announced through the American news agency: "This is the most violent offensive launched by the Allied forces against the main Chinese defense line in a year."
	The enemy's offensive began on October 14th. On this day, the enemy attacked eight of our army's positions on a front of more than ten li north of Kimhwa, but all failed, so on the next day—the 15th—they concentrated their forces to attack the two hills near Sangkumryung. In one day, the enemy fired 250,000 to 300,000 artillery shells at the two hills near Sangkumryung, and dispatched more than 200 aircraft to drop more than 500 heavy bombs on the two hills. Such firepower far exceeded the firepower of the enemy's so-called "Autumn Offensive" last year, and was also the most intense firepower since the Korean War. Moreover, not only that, the enemy also used all the means they could use in the battle: during the day, the enemy used smoke screen launchers and a large amount of smoke screen scattered by aircraft to cover the infantry's group charge; at night, the enemy used flares and the strong light of searchlights to cover their troops' attack. However, the result of the battle for more than a month was that the American aggressors suffered a very serious defeat.
	Our army's commanders and combatants, with the cooperation of artillery fire, defeated the enemy's offensive with the greatest bravery and the best tactical skills. When the enemy carried out artillery shelling and bombing, our army's warriors expressed their determination to defeat the enemy to the Party and the motherland in strong fortifications, and they calmly waited for the enemy's arrival. When the enemy swarmed towards the hills in groups, the warriors used firepower and various clever methods to annihilate the enemy; when the enemy approached, they bravely jumped out of the fortifications and engaged in fierce hand-to-hand combat with the enemy. The traffic trenches on the hills were flattened by the enemy's artillery fire, and the warriors fought relying on one shell crater after another. With the close support of powerful artillery fire, the warriors dealt with dozens of enemies alone, and one squad dealt with a company or even a battalion of enemies. Batches of enemies fell under the warriors' shooting and the fierce stabbing of bayonets.
	In the first day of fierce fighting, Communist Party member Sun Zhanyuan, the platoon leader, had both legs broken, but he still stubbornly directed the battle. When his ammunition was about to run out, he endured the pain and climbed to the pile of enemy corpses, grabbed the machine gun left by the enemy to shoot at the enemy; after the machine gun bullets were used up, he removed the grenades from the enemy's corpses and threw them into the enemy group. When the enemy stepped on the corpses of their comrades and desperately pounced over, he tightly grasped a grenade and shouted loudly to the comrades who were bravely killing the enemy on the hill: "Comrades, fight hard! Annihilate the enemy! Victory is ours!" When the enemy pounced on him, he pulled the grenade, and he gloriously sacrificed himself in the explosion, and the enemy also fell beside him. At this moment, soldiers Wang Yuting and Wang Mingrui rushed over, they swept the surrounding enemies with submachine guns, and threw grenades and explosive packs at the enemies squeezed into a ball. In the face-to-face close combat, the enemy collapsed and was mostly annihilated on the hill.
	The enemy received a head-on blow on the first day of launching a fierce attack. On this day, our army killed and wounded more than 1,900 enemy troops on the two hills, destroyed two enemy tanks, and also captured one enemy tank, four recoilless guns, four rocket launchers, three 60mm mortars, fourteen light and heavy machine guns, seventy carbines, and other weapons.
	After the 14th, fierce battles for the two hills took place almost every day. At that time, the delegation sent by the people of the motherland came to the Sangkumryung front line and sent many gifts through the artillery blockade line to the hands of the brave warriors who were fighting heroically. What a great encouragement and comfort this should be for the warriors who are defending the motherland and world peace! They fought more and more stubbornly, more and more skillfully, and the coordination between infantry and artillery became closer and closer, causing the enemy's casualties to increase day by day.
	When the enemy temporarily occupied the hill, our army's warriors persisted in fighting in the tunnels. The enemy had used heavy bombs, flame throwers, and other methods to destroy the tunnels, but not only did they not succeed once, but they suffered great losses themselves. When the enemy was sneaking around the tunnel entrance with explosives and flame throwers, the warriors who were defending the tunnel said: "The opportunity to hit a live target is here again." Sometimes the enemies came up one by one, and the warriors shot them one by one. On the 22nd, forty enemies lost their lives at the tunnel entrance. Sometimes rows and companies of enemies suddenly rushed over, trying to seize the tunnel entrance in one fell swoop. But when they rushed to the vicinity of the tunnel, the machine guns in the tunnel opened fire, so groups of enemies were hit by bullets and fell to the ground screaming. The enemy had no way, so they hurriedly carried steel plates and wood from the bottom of the mountain to build fortifications. At this time, the warriors in the tunnel excitedly said: "Now, it's our turn!" They used good communication equipment to tell our army's artillery units: "The enemy is building fortifications on the mountain, bomb them hard!" So a burst of artillery shells exploded on the mountain a few minutes later. Li Baocheng, the leader of a heroic company who defended the tunnel for thirteen days and nights and annihilated more than 1,200 enemies, described the scene at that time: "After our artillery bombardment, the enemy's fortifications on the top of the mountain were all gone, the thick wood turned into powder, and the enemy corpses lying in disarray were piled up with the mud!"
	In the fierce battles day and night, our army launched many strong counterattacks. On the night of October 19th, our army's artillery shells hit the enemy like a storm, and the heroic infantry assault team launched an attack under the cover of powerful artillery fire. The resourceful and brave soldier Yi Caixue continuously blasted three enemy group firepower points with grenades, hand grenades, and 60mm mortar shells, destroying seven enemy heavy machine guns and five light machine guns. In front of another enemy firepower point, the Matrosov-style hero—communicator Huang Jiguang used his body to pounce on the enemy's fortifications, blocking the gun hole of the machine gun that was firing, allowing his comrades to successfully rush to the hill. In this counterattack, the warriors annihilated more than 2,500 enemies.
	In the battle on the two hills, the enemy's losses were extremely heavy. After the U.S. 7th Division and the ROK 2nd Division suffered serious casualties, the extremely anxious Van Fleet hurriedly called up a regiment from the ROK 9th Division, which had just suffered a fatal blow on "White Horse Mountain" northwest of Cheorwon, to support the offensive north of Kimhwa, and this executioner constantly replenished a large number of recruits into the heavily depleted troops. As a result, the American news agency exclaimed in a report on November 2nd that this battle "the lives sacrificed by the Allied forces and the ammunition consumed have shocked the Allied commanders,"
	"This loss is second only to the loss suffered by the Eighth Army in North Korea in 1950."
	Now the battle has been going on for more than a month, and these two highlands are still in the hands of our army, but the enemy has suffered more than 20,000 casualties, and 112 aircraft have been shot down and damaged. Recalling Van Fleet's key offensive launched in the Jin-cheng area over a 20-kilometer section last autumn, he used more than four divisions of troops and, after paying a heavy price, managed to climb in a few kilometers. But today, it used more than two divisions of troops, used more intense artillery fire than at that time, and attacked for such a long time, but failed to take these two small hill positions of our army. The American aggressors are increasingly trapped in a sad situation in front of this front.

    范佛里特在金化地区攻势的惨败
    新华社记者  张结、石峰
    在朝鲜中线金化以北上甘岭地区，有两个不大的山岭——五三七点七高地北山和五九七点九高地，它是我军拱卫五圣山的前沿阵地。一个多月来，我军某部在这里连续打退了美李匪军两个多师的疯狂进攻，歼灭敌军达两万多名。
    从今年九月开始，敌人在朝鲜二百多公里长的正面战线上，接连遭到我军沉重的打击。特别在十月六日这一天，我军在西线、中线和东线的许多地区同时发起反击，一举占领敌军的山头阵地二十一处，其中甚至包括美李匪军两个营兵力所据守，筑有强固工事的阵地。美国侵略者为了遮掩它在朝鲜战场上一连串的败绩，集中了美军第七师、李伪军第二师的全部兵力和李伪军第九师的一部分兵力，并集中了美军第八军的全部机动炮兵部队，出动了大量的坦克和飞机，向我军两个连守卫的前沿阵地——五三七点七高地北山和五九七点九高地疯狂进攻。手上沾满朝鲜人民鲜血的刽子手范佛里特事先亲自到前线视察和部署这次疯狂的进攻，然后通过美国通讯社宣称：“这是一年来联军向中国主要防线所发动的一次最猛烈的进攻。”
    敌军的进攻是在十月十四日开始的。这一天，敌军向金化以北十多里长的一段战线上的我军八处阵地进攻，但结果都不能得手，于是在第二天——十五日就集中兵力向上甘岭附近的两座山岭进攻。在一天中，敌人向上甘岭附近的两座山岭发射了二十五万到三十万发炮弹，并且出动了二百架次以上的飞机，向两座山岭投了五百多个重磅炸弹。这样的火力远远超过了去年敌人在其所谓“秋季攻势”中的火力，也是朝鲜战争以来所没有过的猛烈火力。而且不仅如此，敌人在战斗中，还使用了一切能够使用的手段：在白天，敌人用烟幕放射器和飞机散布的大量烟幕来掩护步兵进行集团冲锋；在夜间，敌人用照明弹和探照灯的强烈光芒来掩护他们的部队进行攻击。但是一个多月来战斗的结果，美国侵略者却吃了一个十分严重的大败仗。
    我军指挥员和战斗员们在炮火的配合下，以最大的勇敢和最好的战术技术打败了敌人的进攻。当敌人进行炮击和投炸弹的时候，我军勇士们在坚固的工事里向党向祖国表示了战胜敌人的决心，他们沉着地等待着敌人的到来。当敌人成群地涌向山头的时候，勇士们便用火力和各种巧妙办法消灭敌人；等到敌人接近的时候，他们就奋勇地跳出工事，和敌人进行激烈的肉搏战。山头上的交通沟被敌人的炮火打平了，勇士们就依托着一个个的弹坑作战。勇士们在强大炮火的密切支援下，一个人对付几十个敌人，一个班对付一个连甚至一个营的敌人。敌人一批批地在勇士们的射击下和刺刀的猛刺下倒了下去。
    在第一天的激烈战斗中，共产党员孙占元排长的两条腿被打断了，但他仍然顽强地指挥作战。他在自己的弹药快用完的时候，就忍着疼痛爬到敌人的尸体堆里，抓过敌人丢下的机枪来射击敌人；把机枪子弹打光以后，他又从敌人的尸体上解下手榴弹投向敌群。当敌人踏着他们同伴的尸体拚命地扑来的时候，他紧握着一颗手榴弹，向着正在山头上奋勇杀敌的战友们高呼：“同志们狠狠地打呀！消灭敌人呀！胜利是我们的！”当敌人扑到他身边时，他拉响了手榴弹，自己在爆炸声中光荣牺牲了，敌人也在他的身旁倒了下去。正在这时，战士王玉庭和王明瑞冲了过来，他们端着冲锋枪向四周的敌人猛烈扫射，并且把手榴弹和炸药包投向挤成一团的敌人。在面对面的近战中，敌人溃乱了，大部被歼灭在山上。
    敌人在发动猛烈攻击的第一天就受到当头一棒。这一天我军在两座山岭上杀伤敌军一千九百多名，击毁敌军坦克两辆，并且还缴获敌军坦克一辆、无座力炮四门、火箭筒四个、六零炮三门、轻重机枪十四挺、卡宾枪七十支及其他武器一部。
    在十四日以后，两座山岭上几乎天天发生着激烈的争夺战。当时，祖国人民派出的慰问团来到上甘岭前线，将许多慰问品通过炮火封锁线送到了正在英勇作战的勇士们的手里。这对于保卫祖国和世界和平的勇士们该是多大的鼓舞和安慰呀！他们愈打愈顽强，愈打愈巧妙，步兵和炮兵的协同也愈打愈密切，使敌人的死伤逐日增加。
    当敌人暂时占领山头的时候，我军勇士们就在坑道里坚持战斗。敌人曾经用过投重磅炸弹，放射火焰喷射器等等办法来破坏坑道，可是不但没有一次是成功的，反而自己受到了很大的损失。当敌人抱着炸药，拖着火焰喷射器鬼鬼祟祟地往坑道口摸来的时候，坚守坑道的勇士们就说：“打活靶的机会又来了。”有时敌人一个个的上来，勇士们就一个个的射击。在二十二日这一天，就有四十个敌人在坑道口送了命。有时成排成连的敌人突然冲来，想一下子夺取坑道口。可是当他们冲到坑道附近时，坑道里的机关枪开火了，于是成群的敌人都吃到了子弹，惨叫着倒在地上。敌人没有办法了，就急忙从山下背来钢板和木料修筑工事。这时坑道里的勇士们兴奋地说道：“现在，该看咱们的啦！”他们利用良好的通讯设备告诉我军的炮兵部队说：“山上敌人正在筑工事，狠狠地轰吧！”于是几分钟以后，山上便响起了一片炮弹的爆炸声。一个坚守坑道十三昼夜、先后歼敌一千二百多人的英雄连的连长李保成叙述那时的情景说：“在我们的炮火轰击之后，山顶上敌人的工事就都被打得没有了，粗大的木料变成了粉末，东倒西歪的敌尸一层一层地和泥土堆在一起！”
    在日日夜夜的激战中，我军先后举行了多次强力的反击。十月十九日夜里，我军的炮弹像风暴一样地打向敌人，英勇的步兵突击队就在强大炮火的掩护下发起攻击。智勇双全的战士易才学，一个人用手雷、手榴弹和六零炮弹连续爆破了敌人三个集团火力点，炸毁了敌人七挺重机枪和五挺轻机枪。在另一个敌人的火力点前，马特洛索夫式的英雄——通讯员黄继光用自己的身体扑向敌人的工事，堵住了正在发射的机关枪的枪眼，让战友们顺利地冲上山头。在这一次反击战中，勇士们歼灭了二千五百多名敌人。
    在两座山岭上的战斗中，敌军的损失是极其惨重的。当美七师和伪二师遭到严重伤亡以后，焦虑万分的范佛里特急急忙忙叫刚刚在铁原西北“白马山”上遭到致命打击的伪九师调出一个团来支援在金化以北的进攻，并且这个刽子手不断地把大批新兵补充到大量减员的部队中去。于是美国通讯社在十一月二日的报道中惊呼这次战斗“联军所牺牲的人和所消耗的军火已使联军的司令官们震惊了”，
    “这次损失仅次于一九五零年第八军在北朝鲜惨败时的损失。”
    现在战斗已经进行了一个多月了，这两个高地还在我军手中，敌军却已经伤亡了两万多名，飞机被击落和击伤了一百一十二架。回想去年秋天范佛里特在金城地区二十多公里地段上发动的重点进攻，曾使用了四个多师的兵力，在付出惨重的代价后，还总算爬进了几公里。但是今天，它用了两个多师的兵力，用了比那时更加猛烈的炮火，并且进攻了这样久，竟打不下我军这两个不大的山岭阵地。美国侵略者在这条战线面前是越发陷于悲哀的境地了。
