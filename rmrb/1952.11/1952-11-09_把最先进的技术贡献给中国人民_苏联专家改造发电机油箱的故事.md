In mid-August, the installation of the giant turbine generator at the Fuxin Power Plant, under the guidance of Soviet experts, was about to be completed. All the staff of the installation engineering team could not suppress their excitement, calculating the days of early power generation and the figures for increased production and savings, so as to report the good news to Chairman Mao.

At this moment, Soviet experts Bobolov and Alexander, who were assisting in the installation work, suddenly received a roll of the latest design drawings for the turbine generator oil filter tank from the Moscow Turbine Machine Factory, along with a telegram stating that this advanced experience would be promoted in power plants across the Soviet Union, and therefore, they also hoped to contribute it to the Chinese people. In the Soviet Union, promoting advanced experience has become a habit of every Soviet person. Therefore, the Soviet experts quickly formulated a construction plan for transforming the oil tank according to the design drawings, explained the benefits of transforming the oil tank to the leading cadres of the engineering team, and suggested that they immediately lead the workers to carry out the oil tank transformation work.

The workers of the engineering team were all very sorry to hear that the brand-new and complete Soviet turbine generator they had installed with their own hands was now going to be partially disassembled and modified. Some cadres thought, "Soviet machines are already much stronger than those capitalist countries' machines we are using now, why bother to change them?" Some said, "This machine is so good! It's going to be modified before it's even used. What if it gets broken?" Soviet expert Bobolov seriously criticized this conservative thinking and said, "Soviet machines are indeed the most advanced in the world. But if the oil tank of this turbine generator is not transformed according to the latest design, it will lag behind compared to the Soviet ones. Our responsibility is to help China with construction using the most advanced technology. Therefore, we must transform the advanced oil tank of yesterday into a more advanced oil tank of today, making it as advanced as the Soviet generators!" The Soviet experts' high degree of internationalism and their attitude towards new things deeply moved the cadres of the engineering team.

However, when the intense modification work began, the workers of the turbine construction machine shop were reluctant to disassemble the exquisite spring check valve. Machine worker Yang Pengju stroked the bright parts and said, "It's a pity to discard such a good oil filter before it's even used!" He couldn't help but run to ask the Soviet expert, "Can the new oil tank really be better than this one?" The Soviet expert explained the advantages of the new oil tank in detail. Afterwards, every time a part was removed, the workers always asked the Soviet expert with the same regretful emotion, and the Soviet expert patiently explained each time.

On the seventh day of work, many custom-made or purchased oil filter components and parts were delivered. The Soviet experts carefully and repeatedly inspected each component and part. Soviet expert Alexander used a needle and squinted his eyes to count the small holes on the copper wire mesh, to see if it met the specification of having 754 small holes in an area of one square millimeter (about half a square inch). When he was so tired that his eyes were blurred and he could not continue, Soviet expert Bobolov took over the counting. The workers were so moved that they said, "For us to have the latest type of generator, the latest design drawings that have not yet been promoted in the Soviet Union were sent from Moscow from afar, and the Soviet experts are so enthusiastically modifying it, we must work even harder!" Therefore, the plan to install it in two days was completed in one and a half days. After the hydraulic test, the modification work was completely qualified. The Soviet experts happily shook hands with each machine worker and praised loudly, "Stakhanov! Stakhanov!"

At this time, everyone carefully looked at the new oil tank compared to the original one, and couldn't stop praising, "The new oil tank is indeed better!" The characteristics of the new oil tank are high oil filtration efficiency, and it can be cleaned of oil residue at any time without stopping the machine, which further ensures the safe operation of the most important bearing part of the turbine generator and greatly extends the life of the generator.

After the oil tank modification was successful, the turbine generator began to operate and generate electricity. The engineering team workers warmly congratulated and thanked the Soviet experts. Soviet expert Bobolov said, "We were sent by Comrade Stalin to help China with construction, and our responsibility is to contribute the most advanced technology to the Chinese people!"

    把最先进的技术贡献给中国人民
    ——苏联专家改造发电机油箱的故事
    新华社记者  周群  陶肃琦
    八月中旬，阜新发电厂的巨型透平发电机安装工作，在苏联专家指导下，眼看就要完成了。安装工程队的全体职工们个个都压抑不住兴奋的心情，天天计算着提早发电的日子和增产节约的数字，好给毛主席报喜讯。
    就在这时，协助安装工作的苏联专家鲍波洛夫和亚历山大等，突然接到莫斯科透平机制造厂寄来一卷透平发电机滤油箱的最新设计图样，另外还附来
    一封电报，说明这个先进经验就要在苏联全国各发电厂推广，因此，也希望把它贡献给中国人民。在苏联，推广先进经验已成为每个苏维埃人民的习惯了，因此，苏联专家很快就按照设计图样制订了改造油箱的施工计划，并向工程队领导干部说明改造油箱的好处，建议立即领导职工进行油箱的改造工作。
    工程队的职工们听说亲手安装起来的崭新完整的苏联透平发电机，现在要把它进行部分拆卸改装，都表示很惋惜。有的干部认为：“苏联机器比我们现在使用的那些资本主义国家的机器，已经强多了，何必再改？”有的说：“这部机器多好！还没使用就要进行改装，若是改坏了，那就糟了！”苏联专家鲍波洛夫在严肃地批判了这种保守思想后说：“苏联机器的确在世界上是最先进的。但这部透平发电机的油箱如果不按照现在最新的设计加以改造，就会使它和苏联的比起来落后了。我们的责任是用最先进的技术来帮助中国进行建设，因此我们要把昨天先进的油箱，改造成今天更先进的油箱，使它和苏联的发电机一样先进！”苏联专家这种高度的国际主义精神和对待新事物的态度，深深感动了工程队的干部们。
    但是，当紧张的改装工作开始进行，透平工地机工班工人们看到精致的弹簧逆止门时，大家都不愿下手拆卸。机工杨鹏举抚摸着光亮的机件说：“这样好的滤油器还没有用就废了，多可惜呀！”他禁不住跑去问苏联专家：“新油箱真能比这个更好吗？”苏联专家就详细地给讲解新油箱的优点。以后每拆下一部分零件，工人们总是以同样惋惜的情绪询问苏联专家，而苏联专家也就每次都耐心地加以解释。
    工作进行到第七天，许多定制或购买的机油过滤部件、零件都运到了。苏联专家对每个部件和零件都认真仔细地反复进行检查。苏联专家亚历山大用一根针，眯着眼睛去点数铜丝布上的细孔，看它是否合乎在每一平方公厘（约半市寸见方）的面积上有七百五十四个细孔的规格。当他累得眼花撩乱，不能继续进行时，苏联专家鲍波洛夫又接上去点数。工人们都感动得说：“为了我们有最新式的发电机，在苏联还没有推广的最新设计图样，莫斯科就老远地寄了来，苏联专家又这样热情地改装，我们更得加劲干啊！”因此，原定两天安装好的计划，一天半就完成了。经过水压试验，改装工作完全合格。苏联专家高兴得和每个机工亲切握手，高声赞扬：“斯塔哈诺夫！斯塔哈诺夫！”
    这时，大家对照着原来的那个油箱把新油箱仔细地看了一下，都不住嘴地称赞道：“还是新油箱好啊！”新油箱的特点是机油过滤效力高，而且不用停车就可以随时抽出来清扫油渣，这样就更加保证了透平发电机最主要轴承部分的安全运转，大大延长发电机的寿命。
    油箱改造成功后，透平发电机开始运转发电了。工程队职工们热烈地向苏联专家祝贺致谢。苏联专家鲍波洛夫说：“我们是斯大林同志派来帮助中国建设的，我们的责任是要把最先进的技术贡献给中国人民！”
