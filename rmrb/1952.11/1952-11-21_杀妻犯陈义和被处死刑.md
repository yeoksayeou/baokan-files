    Wife-Killer Chen Yihe Executed

    Editor: Zheng Yunlan, a woman from Changan Township, Guanshan District, Quanjiao County, Anhui Province, was forced into an arranged marriage with Chen Yihe, a fellow villager who had once been a bandit, when she was eighteen years old. After the marriage, Zheng Yunlan was frequently subjected to abuse, beatings, and humiliation by Chen Yihe, and there was no affection between them. In January of this year, Zheng Yunlan requested a divorce from the People's Government, which was granted by the county People's Court. However, when Zheng Yunlan asked Chen Yihe for the property awarded to her by the court, Chen Yihe refused and threatened Zheng Yunlan "not to marry anyone else" and to "continue to live with him." Zheng Yunlan, of course, disagreed. Chen Yihe harbored malicious intentions and plotted to kill her. On the evening of the 27th day of the fourth lunar month of this year, when Zheng Yunlan passed by Zhengdaba Chong, Chen Yihe secretly followed her with a large iron shovel and cruelly struck her head from behind, hitting her three more times, killing her on the spot. Fearing discovery, Chen Yihe tied a stone to Zheng Yunlan's body and threw it into the dam. The next day, Yang Shengwen, the director of the township farmers' association, and Wang Liangsheng, the security committee member, passed by the scene of the incident and found bloodstains, hair, shovel marks, and other suspicious signs. They then encountered Chen Yihe and noticed bloodstains on his clothes. Upon inspecting Chen Yihe's home, they found a pair of blood-stained pants being dried. When questioned, Chen Yihe initially tried to deny it, but with all the evidence against him, he finally confessed to the murder. Yang Shengwen and others immediately handed the criminal over to the county People's Court for punishment. The county People's Government specially convened a county-wide farmers' representative conference to discuss the incident. The representatives unanimously demanded that the criminal be severely punished and formulated resolutions concerning the implementation of the Marriage Law. On October 19th, the county People's Court held a public trial at Dama Factory in Guanshan District. More than 12,000 people attended the meeting and unanimously demanded that the criminal Chen Yihe be shot. The People's Court accepted the demands of the masses, announced the death penalty for Chen Yihe, and executed him on the spot. Women reflected: This ensures that our women's marriages can truly be free, and our lives and property are protected.

    杀妻犯陈义和被处死刑
    编辑同志：安徽省全椒县孤山区长安乡妇女郑云兰，十八岁时被父母包办和一曾经当过土匪的同乡陈义和结婚。结婚后，郑云兰经常受陈义和虐待、打骂、凌辱，根本没有什么情感。今年一月间，郑云兰向人民政府要求离婚，经该县人民法院判准了。可是当郑云兰向陈义和索取经法院判给的财产时，陈义和不答应，并威胁郑云兰“不准另嫁别人”，要和他“继续同居”。郑云兰当然不同意。陈义和便心怀不轨，阴谋杀害她。今年农历四月二十七日傍晚，郑云兰路过郑大坝冲地方时，陈义和暗带一把大铁锹追跟上去，残忍地从后面向郑云兰头部砍下，又连砍三锹，当时就把郑云兰砍死。陈义和怕被人发觉，设法把郑云兰的尸体绑上一块石头投到水坝里。第二天，该乡农会主任杨胜文、治安委员汪良胜路过出事地点，看到血迹、头发、铁锹印子等等，觉得奇怪；继又遇到陈义和，发现他衣服上有血迹；再到陈义和家里察看，发现正晒着一条血裤子。遂追问陈义和，起初他还企图狡赖，但凶迹俱在，陈终于一一承认杀人经过。杨胜文等立即把该凶犯送交县人民法院惩办。县人民政府特为这一事件召开了全县农民代表大会，代表们一致要求严办凶犯，并制订了有关贯彻婚姻法的决议。十月十九日，县人民法院又特在孤山区大马厂地方召开了公审大会。到会群众一万二千多人，一致要求枪毙凶犯陈义和。人民法院接受群众的要求，宣布判处陈义和死刑，并当场枪决。妇女们反映：这样，我们妇女的婚姻才能真正得到自由，我们的生命财产才有保障。
