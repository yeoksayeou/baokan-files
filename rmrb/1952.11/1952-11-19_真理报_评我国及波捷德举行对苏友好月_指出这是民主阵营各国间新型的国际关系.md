Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, Eighteenth Dispatch from TASS: The "Pravda" newspaper published on the 16th a commentary by Makarenko and Dudinsky on the lives of people's democratic countries. One section discussed the Friendship Month with the Soviet Union currently being held in the People's Republic of China, Poland, Czechoslovakia, and the German Democratic Republic. The commentary stated that the Friendship Month with the Soviet Union vividly illustrates the new type of international relationship established among countries in the democratic and socialist camp. This relationship is based on fraternal friendship, economic cooperation, and mutual assistance. The Friendship Month with the Soviet Union allows the working people of fraternal countries to understand the lives of the Soviet people and to learn about Soviet achievements in science, literature, music, fine arts, drama, and film. The brilliant prospects of Soviet communist construction inspire the working people of people's democratic countries to strive to build a new life and further strengthen their friendship with the Soviet Union.

The main manifestation of the Friendship Month with the Soviet Union in people's democratic countries is the broad masses of people studying Stalin's brilliant work "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR" and Stalin's speech at the closing session of the 19th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party, as well as the various resolutions of the Congress. At the same time, the Friendship Month with the Soviet Union demonstrates the love of the working people of these countries for the Soviet Union, which consistently pursues a policy of international peace and friendship. People all over the world recognize that the Soviet Union's assistance to people's democratic countries is genuine and fraternal, aimed at improving their productivity and the cultural level of their people, and consolidating their national independence. Therefore, continuously strengthening and expanding friendly relations with the Soviet Union has become the slogan of the Friendship Month with the Soviet Union; this is particularly dear to all the working people of the people's democratic countries.

    “真理报”评我国及波捷德举行对苏友好月
    指出这是民主阵营各国间新型的国际关系
    【新华社十八日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：真理报十六日刊载了马卡连科和杜丁斯基关于人民民主国家生活的一篇评论，其中一节谈到了中华人民共和国、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克和德意志民主共和国正在举行的对苏友好月。评论写道，对苏友好月生动地说明了民主和社会主义阵营各国间所建立的新型的国际关系，这种关系是以兄弟般的友谊、经济合作和互助为基础的。对苏友好月使兄弟国家的劳动人民了解苏联人民的生活，了解苏联在科学、文学、音乐、美术、戏剧和电影各方面的成就。苏联共产主义建设的光辉远景鼓舞了人民民主国家的劳动人民努力建设新生活并进一步加强和苏联的友谊。
    人民民主国家的对苏友好月的主要表现，就是广大人民学习斯大林的天才著作“苏联社会主义经济问题”和斯大林在联共第十九次代表大会闭幕会上的演说以及代表大会的各项决议。同时，对苏友好月表明了这些国家的劳动人民对于一贯奉行国际和平友好政策的苏联的热爱。全世界人民都认识到，苏联给人民民主国家的援助是真正的、兄弟般的援助，其目的在于提高它们的生产力和它们的人民的文化水平，并巩固它们的民族独立。因此，不断加强并扩大和苏联的友好联系，成了举行对苏友好月的口号；这对于人民民主国家的全体劳动人民说来是特别亲切的。
