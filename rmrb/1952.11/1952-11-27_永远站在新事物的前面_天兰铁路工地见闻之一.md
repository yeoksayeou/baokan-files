    Always Standing at the Forefront of New Things
    — First Impressions from the Tianlan Railway Construction Site
    By Our Correspondent Lu Hao
    At the 38-kilometer mark of the Tianlan Railway, train tracks now safely extend forward from the foot of the mountain. The cleanly cut and bare cliff stands steadily beside the roadbed, and trains speed by. It was here, two years ago, that a man who used to carry a gun overturned the complex designs of engineers and saved the nation sixteen billion yuan in wealth. It is he – Comrade Hu Ziming, the Political Commissar of the Gangu Engineering Section of the Northwest Railway Main Line Engineering Bureau – who, in a short period of time, has gradually begun to become someone relatively familiar with engineering.
    In December of 1951, track laying was being carried out intensely in this engineering section. At this location, the head of a high cliff protruded northward, a huge dark mass seeming as if it were about to fall, and the roadbed was to pass precisely beneath this dangerous cliff top. According to the original design of the engineers, the plan was to spend eighteen billion yuan to build a 92-meter-long open tunnel to block the collapse of the entire cliff top.
    However, based on his on-site observations, Hu Ziming disagreed with this approach. After investigation, he saw that the surface soil layer of the mountain was weathered debris; however, the inner layers of the mountain were not like that. Especially the base of the mountain had not lost its balance. He thought: if the mountain head that looked like it was about to fall could be cut away, this open tunnel could be completely avoided. He discussed this idea with the engineers responsible for construction in the section. Some engineers were dubious; some believed that the design was already set and there was no need to change it; some even thought it was meddling; but there were also those who fully supported this idea. Hu Ziming took this idea all the way to the leadership organs. The leadership sent two engineers to inspect the site. The result of the inspection was that it was possible to not build the open tunnel, but laying the track on the original roadbed was a bit risky. The best approach was to change the route so that the tracks bypassed the area. Changing the route would save eight or nine billion yuan compared to building the open tunnel.
    When Hu Ziming returned from the Party Representative Conference, he heard that the revised construction drawings had already been drawn, and the earthwork for the route change was about to start quickly. Hu Ziming thought: if the slope could be cut, why should the route be changed? He thought about it over and over and couldn't figure it out, so he invited several engineers from the section to inspect the site together. Hu Ziming climbed all the way to the top of the cliff, and the more he looked, the more he was certain that the idea of cutting the slope was correct. After cutting the slope, driving would definitely not encounter any danger.
    Back at the section, Hu Ziming convened a meeting of engineering and technical personnel, asking everyone to consider his opinion carefully again. Under his leadership, the engineers actively participated in the discussion and supported Hu Ziming's correct opinion.
    When this opinion was submitted to the bureau's leadership department again, some engineers in the bureau still didn't quite agree. Hu Ziming said, "Whoever disagrees, please come to the site again and see who is right, otherwise it is bureaucracy." The leading organs conducted another investigation and study, and finally fully agreed with Hu Ziming's proposal to cut off the mountain head, building a 50-meter-long retaining wall at the foot of the mountain, costing about 200 million yuan in labor and materials. Compared to building the open tunnel, Hu Ziming's suggestion saved the country sixteen billion yuan.
    An outsider was actually able to solve a problem that some engineering and technical personnel could not solve. In Hu Ziming, we can see the correct attitude that an old cadre maintains in the face of new things.
    When Hu Ziming first came to the Gangu Engineering Section, there were some discussions among the engineering and technical personnel. Some said: "No matter how high your politics are, you can't master engineering with politics alone. Technology is always higher than everything else." Some said: "Even if you smash my brain, I won't believe that an outsider can lead us." But these words could not scare this old Shaanbei cadre who joined the revolution in 1935. Of course, things were not always smooth sailing. At first, a person accustomed to living in the armed forces was really unaccustomed to working in an enterprise department, but he quickly thought that many comrades had already dedicated their lives for the happiness of the motherland and the people. Why didn't he want to participate in national construction now that he was alive? He had experienced all kinds of difficulties and never believed that any difficulty could stump him, so why should he be afraid of difficulties this time?
    Therefore, Hu Ziming was not like some old cadres who, when they saw that they were surrounded by great intellectuals who read thick specialized books and spoke full of engineering terminology, thought that they were not highly educated and were an outsider to railway engineering, and thus became discouraged. They said things like "People can finish reading a book in three hours, but we can't finish reading it in ten days," "They are foreign students, and we are bumpkins. How can we lead them?" In a word, they hesitated in the face of new things. But our Hu Ziming stood forever at the forefront of new things with a fighting posture, and thus made an important contribution to the Party and the people.
    However, on the Tianlan Road, there really was another kind of person. Although they were busy going to work and getting off work every day, attending large and small meetings, signing and stamping, they isolated their work from engineering construction. They said, "We don't understand engineering, so don't participate in the opinions, lest we ruin things." Zhao Wenpin, the Political Commissar of the Longxi Engineering Section, was the one who put down his ideological weapons and was frightened by the unreformed old technical personnel.
    In 1950, when the Longxi Engineering Section was surveying the Ya'erxia line, there were two lines, north and south. The engineers, foremen, and surveyors who participated in the survey all said that the south line was too large, with a 1,445-meter tunnel within two kilometers, deep ditches of more than fourteen meters, and 300 meters of protective engineering, which would cost a lot of money and take a long time. However, Zhou Zhu (an engineer), the section chief of the engineering section, insisted on taking the south line. The reason was that the south line was straight, and the north line was threatened by floods. Fighting with water was not as good as fighting with mountains. But he ignored that the stones on this mountain were all rubble, making the engineering even more difficult. In order to decide whether to take the north line or the south line, the leading organs sent engineers to inspect it, and they also said that the north line was good, but Zhou Zhu still didn't listen. Zhao Wenpin didn't express much opinion on these matters. He felt that he couldn't manage it even if he wanted to, so it was better not to manage it. The south line of Ya'erxia started construction in late July; by August 30, the bureau ordered to take the north line, and as a result, more than 70,000 cubic meters of earthwork was done in vain, and more than 340,000 catties of millet were wasted. Some people couldn't stand it and raised objections to Zhao Wenpin in person. Zhao Wenpin always felt that he didn't understand technology and couldn't do without them, so he had to accommodate them, and thus always explained: "Zhou Zhu still wants to do the work well, he is still active."
    The matter is very clear: in the basic construction department, is it that the Party must realize the leadership of basic construction? Or blindly hand over the basic construction work to unreformed old technical personnel? Is it that you actively study the business and use correct thinking to lead technical personnel to improve their work? Or do you simply not ask about technology and run around behind the technical personnel? Hu Ziming and Zhao Wenpin took two different paths.
    Hu Ziming worked with technical personnel, and he often helped them ideologically, so that they could correct their shortcomings, improve their work, and save wealth for the country. For example, when he worked in the engineering section, he saw that many technical personnel spent money on engineering, often tens or hundreds of millions, but they didn't spend the country's money as carefully and meticulously as they spent their own.
    Once, when Section Chief Cui Zhandou was calculating the labor price of loose stone in the 28th tunnel, he said vaguely: "Let's collect it according to the price of hard stone." In fact, the price of each cubic meter of hard stone was almost twice as expensive as that of loose stone. When Hu Ziming learned about this matter, he immediately sent someone to check it. Cui Zhandou was afraid that what he had done would be checked by others, and he even said to the person who went to check: "You don't lead others, what are you doing?" Later, Hu Ziming asked Cui Zhandou, "What kind of stone is it?" Cui Zhandou said vaguely:
    "I think loose stone is not loose stone, and hard stone is not hard stone." In fact, according to the person who checked, these stones were hard when they were originally knocked down, but they became loose when they were exposed to the wind. They were really loose stones. Hu Ziming not only educated Cui Zhandou on this matter, but also reduced the loss of tens of millions of yuan to the country.
    Zhao Wenpin was the opposite of Hu Ziming. He treated technical personnel with a smile all day long, with a face full of spring breeze, or just took care of their lives. On the surface, it seemed that Zhao Wenpin was in charge of the basic construction of the Longxi section of the railway, but in reality, it was manipulated by Section Chief Zhou Zhu. Therefore, when problems occurred, Zhao Wenpin either didn't know about them; or if he knew about them, he was helpless. Under such circumstances, the work of the Longxi section was once in a very chaotic state. A lot of cement and wood used in engineering were first transported by car to Longxi City to be unloaded, and then loaded onto other cars and transported to the construction site. Some places used the best Northeast pine wood to build a lot of material warehouses, but some of these material warehouses would be useless in the future. There were ready-made stones and sand near the railway, but the work of quarrying and sand was carried out three or five kilometers away from the railway, so the transportation cost was more expensive than the mining cost. These were very obvious wastes, but Zhao Wenpin seemed not to have seen them. Zhou Zhu served as the section chief of the Longxi section for a year and a half. In addition to doing more than one million cubic meters of earthwork by migrant workers, the achievements were very small. If the leading organs had not implemented the correct policy of relying on the working class, uniting and reforming technical personnel, and developing production in enterprise departments, the Tianlan Railway would not have been built in five or ten years, and the losses suffered by the country would have been even more difficult to calculate.
    The people demand that we always stand at the forefront of new things, and always cherish our glorious experiences. We, the long-tested old cadres sent by the Party Committee to work in enterprise departments, must move forward without stopping for a moment to meet the needs of the people.

    永远站在新事物的前面
    ——天兰铁路工地见闻之一
    本报记者  陆灏
    在天兰铁路三十八公里的地方，现在是铁轨从山脚下安全地伸向前去，那削得光秃秃的山崖稳稳地竖立在路基的旁边，火车飞驰而过。就在这个地方，是一位两年以前还是拿枪杆的人，推翻了工程师们复杂的设计，并为国家节省了十六亿元的财富。就是他——西北铁路干线工程局甘谷工程段的政委呼子明同志，经过了短短的时间，已经开始逐渐成为一个比较熟悉工程的人了。
    那是在一九五一年的十二月，铺轨工程正在这个工程段紧张进行。这地方有一座高高的山崖的头部向北突出，黑压压地一大块像要掉下来似的，而路基恰恰正要从这险恶的崖顶下面通过。这种情况，按照工程师们原来的设计，是准备花十八亿元建筑一座九十二公尺长的明峒，利用这明峒挡住这整个崖顶的倒坍。
    但是，呼子明根据自己在现场的观察，他不同意这样的做法。他经过调查以后，看到山的表皮的土层是风化碎碴；但山的里层却并不是这样。特别是山的基础，还没有失去平衡。他想：如果把那个看着快要掉下来的山头削去，这个明峒就可以完全免修。他把这个意见和段上负责施工的工程师们商量，工程师们有的心里将信将疑；有的则认为已经设计好了，不必再改动；有的甚至认为是多管闲事；但也有完全支持这一意见的。呼子明把这个意见一直提到了领导机关，领导上派了两位工程师来实地察看，察看的结果，认为不作明峒可以，但要在原来的路基上铺轨总有点冒险，最好的办法是改线，使铁轨绕过这个地方。改线比作明峒要节省八、九亿元。
    当呼子明开完党代表会议回来，改线的施工图表听说已画出来，改线的土石方工程也很快就要开工了。呼子明想：既可削坡，为何又要改线？想来想去想不通，于是又请了段上几位工程师一块去工地察看。呼子明一直爬到山崖的顶上，越看越肯定了削坡的意见是正确的。削坡以后，行车决不会遇到什么危险。
    回到段上，呼子明召集工程技术人员开了一个会，要求大家对他的意见再作慎重考虑。工程师们在他的带动之下，积极地参加了讨论并支持了呼子明的正确意见。
    当这意见再次向局的领导部门提出的时候，局里有的工程师还不大同意。呼子明说：“谁不同意，就请再到现场来看，比比谁有理，否则是官僚主义。”领导机关再一次派人作了调查研究，最后终于全部同意了呼子明把山头削去的建议，在山脚下修筑了一道长五十公尺的御土墙，花去工料费约二亿。和修明峒相比，呼子明的建议为国家少支出十六亿元。
    一个外行人，居然能解决有的工程技术人员不能解决的问题。在呼子明的身上，可以看到一个老干部在新鲜事物面前所保持的正确的态度。
    呼子明刚来到甘谷工程段的时候，工程技术人员中间也曾有过一些议论。有的说：“你们的政治再高，但光凭政治不能掌握工程，技术无论如何是高于一切的。”有的说：“就是把我的脑子打烂了，我也不相信外行人能领导我们。”但这些话并不能吓住这位一九三五年参加革命的陕北老干部。当然，事情并不是一帆风顺的，开头，一个在武装部队里生活惯的人到企业部门来工作，实在很不习惯，但他很快想到，很多同志为了祖国人民的幸福，已经献出了自己的生命，自己能活着参加国家建设，为什么还不想去呢？自己什么困难也经历过来了，从不相信有什么困难能难住自己，为什么这一次就要害怕困难了呢？
    因此，呼子明不像有些老干部那样，当看到自己的周围都是大知识分子，读的是大本大本的专门书籍，满口讲的是工程上的名词术语的时候，自己就想到文化程度不高，想到对铁路工程是外行，于是有的就泄气了。说什么“人家看上三个钟头书，咱看十天也看不完”，“人家是留洋生，咱们是土包子，咱怎么能领导人家”。一句话，在新鲜事物的面前踌躇起来。而我们的呼子明是以战斗的姿态，永远地站在新事物的前面，于是他对党对人民作了重要的贡献。
    但是，在天兰路上，也确实有过另外一种人。他们每天虽然也忙着上班下班，参加大会小会，签名盖章，但他们把自己的工作和工程建设隔离起来。他们说：“咱不懂工程，可别参加意见，免得把事情弄坏了。”陇西工程段的政委赵文品，他就是放下了自己思想的武装，被未经改造的旧技术人员吓住了。
    一九五零年陇西工程段在测量鸭儿峡线路的时候，当时有南北两条线。参加测量工作的工程师、领工员、测量工都说南线工程太大，在两公里内有一千四百四十五公尺的隧道，十四公尺以上的深沟，还要作三百公尺长的防护工程，费钱多，工期也长。但工程段的段长周铸（工程师）却坚持走南线。理由是南线线路顺直，北线有水患威胁，与水作斗争不如与山作斗争。但他不顾这山上的石头都是碎石，工程困难更大。为了决定走北线还是走南线，领导机关派工程师来察看过，也说走北线好，但周铸仍然不听。赵文品对于这些事情总是不大发表意见的，他觉得要管管不了，既管不了，还是不管为妙。鸭儿峡的南线在七月下旬开始动工；到八月三十日，局里才下令改走北线，结果，七万多土方就算白做，三十四万余斤小米白白被浪费了。有的人实在看不过，当面向赵文品提意见，赵文品总觉得自己不懂技术，离开人家不行，只好迁就迁就，因而总是解释说：“周铸还是想把工作作好的，他还是积极的。”
    事情很明白，在基本建设部门中，是党必须实现对基本建设的领导呢？还是把基本建设工作盲目地交给未经改造的旧技术人员；是自己积极钻研业务，用正确的思想领导技术人员改进工作呢？还是自己根本不问技术，跟在技术人员的屁股后面乱跑。呼子明和赵文品就走了两条不同的道路。
    呼子明和技术人员在一起工作，他常常在思想上帮助他们，使他们改正缺点，提高自己的工作，为国家节省财富。譬如，他在工程段工作，看到很多技术人员在工程上花钱，动不动就是十亿百亿，但他们花国家的钱，却不像花自己的钱那样，精打细算，无微不至。
    有一次，段长崔瞻斗在计算二十八号隧道松石的工价时，稀里糊涂说：“按坚石收了吧。”实际上，每方坚石的价钱，要比松石几乎贵两倍。呼子明知道了这件事情，立刻派人去检查，崔瞻斗害怕他做的事受人检查，还胡乱地对去检查的人说：“你们又不领导别人，去干什么？”后来，呼子明问崔瞻斗，“究竟是什么石头？”崔瞻斗含含糊糊地说：
    “我看松石不是松石，坚石不是坚石。”其实，据检查的人说：这些石头，原来打下来的时候是硬的，见风一吹，就松一些，实在是松石。呼子明在这件事情上不但教育了崔瞻斗，而且，使国家少受千百万元的损失。
    赵文品和呼子明相反，他对待技术人员是一天到晚笑呵呵，满面春风，或者是仅仅照顾照顾他们的生活。表面上看起来陇西段铁路的基本建设是赵文品在掌握，但实际上是操纵在段长周铸的手里。因而问题发生了，赵文品有的是不知道；有的知道了，也无可奈何。在这样的情形下，陇西段的工作曾陷于很混乱的状态，很多工程上用的洋灰、木料，都是先用车拉到陇西城里卸下来，然后再装在别的车上拉到施工地点去。有些地方用最好的东北松木盖了不少料库，而这些料库将来有些是没用的。铁路附近有现成的石子、砂子，但采石、采砂的工作却在离铁路三公里或五公里的地方进行，结果是运费比采费还贵得多。这些说起来是很明显的浪费，但赵文品好像没有看见一样。周铸在陇西段当了一年半段长，除由民工做了一百多万土方外，成就很小。如果不是领导机关贯彻了企业部门依靠工人阶级，团结与改造技术人员，发展生产的正确方针，天兰铁路五年、十年也不能修成，国家受到的损失将更难计算。
    人民要求我们永远站在新鲜事物的面前，永远珍爱自己光荣的经历，我们受党委派到企业部门工作的久经锻炼的老干部们，必须一刻不停止地前进，以满足人民的需要。
