The Middle East and Near East have always been the site of fierce contention among imperialist countries. The main objective of this struggle lies primarily in the rich resources of the Middle East and Near East, most importantly oil. The imperialists also covet this region due to its strategic position, as it is where Europe, Asia, and Africa meet.

Before World War II, Britain had the upper hand in the struggle for the Middle East and Near East. British imperialists occupied countries such as Egypt, Iraq, and Transjordan, and established a vast network of military bases in the area—Port Said, Suez, Aden, Basra, Cyprus, etc. Britain developed the Middle East and Near East into its source of raw materials, using this as one of the foundations of the British Empire's strength. In half a century, British capitalists extracted over 300 million tons of oil in Iran alone, with net profits totaling five billion US dollars.

British imperialists occupied Egypt at the end of the last century, turning it into a vast cotton plantation, providing cheap, high-quality raw materials for the textile giants of Lancashire. Iraq became a place to provide Britain with cheap grain, especially wheat and fruit.

British imperialists have always been keen to protect the Middle East and Near East, preventing other imperialist plunderers from infiltrating. However, World War II weakened the strength of the British Empire, and the situation changed as a result. American imperialism was already very active in this region during the war, especially in Saudi Arabia. In the first few years after the war, the United States had already established its firm position in Turkey.

It goes without saying that the active involvement of the United States in the Near East and Middle East is by no means for the benefit of its British partner.

After American imperialists consolidated their position in Saudi Arabia and Turkey, they raised the question: according to the new balance of power on the world stage, the role played by the United States in the Middle East and Near East should also change. The American pamphlet "American Interests in the Middle East," published in 1948, clearly stated this demand. The pamphlet admitted that after World War II, the American "official" had "increased many times the interest" in the oil deposits of Iran, Iraq, and the Arabian Peninsula. The pamphlet insisted that the United States must not only "directly participate" in the affairs of Turkey and Saudi Arabia, but also intervene in the affairs of other countries in the region.

Between 1949 and 1950, American imperialists launched a frenzied attack on Britain's economic and political positions in some countries in the Middle East and Near East; in the past, Britain had virtually held a monopoly in these countries. The spearhead of the attack was first directed at Iran.

In the spring of 1951, the Iranian Parliament yielded to the unanimous demands of the people and passed the law on the nationalization of the oil industry and the abolition of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company. At that time, the US government was not busy supporting the British. It was not until the bill had been passed and the rights of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company had been legally deprived that the US government came forward to advocate Anglo-Iranian negotiations on oil issues. Washington knew in advance that Britain would never agree to the nationalization bill, the negotiations would inevitably fail, and the disputing parties would have to ask the US government to "mediate."

As expected, the negotiations between the Iranian government and representatives of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company in June 1951 yielded no results. In July-August of the same year, tripartite US-British-Iranian negotiations began. The American representative participating in the negotiations was millionaire and politician Harriman. Harriman's proposal advocated giving American capitalists the key to access Iranian oil resources.

The policy of American imperialists aroused unparalleled anger in London's financial circles. The "Economist" magazine, the mouthpiece of British financial giants, openly denounced the US's "betrayal." This dissatisfaction is entirely understandable. Britain lost control of this oil resource; in 1950 alone, Britain obtained about 32 million tons of cheap oil from here. Britain's loss of Iranian oil has deepened its dependence on the United States; in the future, Britain will have to beg merchants across the Atlantic for oil.

On the surface, the United States, on the Iranian oil issue, stood with Britain to force Iran to accept an agreement to abandon the policy of nationalizing the oil industry. However, behind the scenes, the US and Britain continued to fight. The evidence is: in May of this year, the oil tanker "Rose Mary" shipped 1,000 tons of oil from Iran to the newly established Italian "Epim" oil company, but the tanker was detained by British authorities in the Gulf of Aden. It was later revealed that the backstage boss of "Epim" company was an American oil merchant.

The assassination of King Abdullah of Transjordan was a heavy blow to British imperialists, because he was one of the main figures in implementing British policy in the Near East. Abdullah was the main supporter of the "Greater Syria" plan, which was to unite Syria, Iraq, and Transjordan under a pro-British dynasty. Arab newspapers pointed out that Abdullah's assassination was the work of American spies.

After Abdullah's death, a behind-the-scenes struggle for the throne unfolded in Transjordan. Britain tried its best to oppose the legitimate heir to the throne, the pro-American Prince Talal of Transjordan. Despite British conspiracies and obstruction, Talal still inherited his father's throne. However, in May of this year, Talal was forced to abdicate, on the pretext that he seemed to be suffering from a nervous illness and was unable to manage state affairs. Now, a regency council composed of pro-British figures holds the supreme power of the country.

The struggle between the US and Britain for power in Syria is extremely fierce and cruel. Why is this? Because: First, some oil pipelines that transport oil from the Arabian Peninsula to the Mediterranean coast pass through Syrian territory; second, this country plays an important role in the realization of Britain's "Greater Syria" plan. Between 1949 and 1951, this small country experienced four coups. Assassinations occurred during the coups. As a result of the November 1951 coup, a military group's regime was established in Syria. According to foreign newspapers, this group was supported by the United States.

Currently, the United States is diplomatically exploiting the difficulties encountered by Britain in Egypt to seek its own interests. Last October, the Egyptian Parliament declared the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty signed in 1936 invalid. The British army's occupation of the Suez Canal area was based on this treaty. This decision was taken at the request of the Egyptian people, who could not tolerate others occupying their land. During this period, negotiations were held between Washington and London; the result of the negotiations was the proposal to establish a "Middle East Command." This plan stipulates that US and British troops occupy Egypt and other countries in the Middle East and Near East. Britain's endorsement of this plan is tantamount to agreeing to a joint occupation by the US and Britain instead of a one-nation occupation by Britain.

However, the plan to establish a "Middle East Command" is easier said than done. The people of the Middle East and Near East accurately saw the threat this plan posed to their national independence and rejected it.

This plan has deepened the contradictions between the US and Britain. Although the British ruling group agreed to the entry of US troops into the Middle East and Near East countries in accordance with the "Middle East Command" plan, it still wanted to retain control over these armed forces. London firmly insisted that a British general lead the "Middle East Command." According to the "Egyptian Gazette," this issue was finally brought to the meeting of foreign ministers of the United States, Britain, and France held in London for discussion, but no agreement was reached. American newspapers believe that the emergence of the plan to establish a "Middle East Command" indicates that Britain's position in the Middle East and Near East has been further weakened. As "US News & World Report" said: Currently, "Britain cannot play a big role in this region, but can act as a little helper for the United States."

The contradictions existing between imperialists will never prevent their joint action on the issue of suppressing national liberation struggles. But in this case, every competing country is trying to consolidate its position.

American newspapers unreservedly said that Ghavam suddenly seized power in Iran due to the activities of American diplomats. Russell, the Washington correspondent for the "New York Herald Tribune," said that Washington's "plan to support Ghavam" sought to "help Ghavam maintain power during negotiations with London on oil issues."

At the same time, American newspapers emphasized that the negotiations between the British and Ghavam governments should be based on the proposals put forward by the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development. Everyone knows that this proposal stipulates that Iran abandon the policy of nationalizing the oil industry and make it possible for American capital to penetrate Iran. It is significant that British newspapers, unlike American newspapers, did not welcome Ghavam's appearance on the stage as the Prime Minister of Iran, although Britain did not refuse to negotiate with him on oil issues.

Ghavam was forced to step down under the wave of popular protests. American newspapers had to admit that this was a blow to merchants across the ocean. Russell pointed out: "All of Washington's plans have to be shelved again, and Washington's officials are going to be worried again."

It can be seen from the reports of many foreign newspapers that Egypt's recent coup is related to American conspiracies. The United States is trying its best to quickly resolve the issue of dragging Egypt into the "Middle East Command" in accordance with the US imperialist expansion plan.

American newspapers differ again from British newspapers on this point. American newspapers welcomed the recent armed coup in Egypt led by General Naguib. "The Wall Street Journal" at that time expressed the hope that the new Prime Minister Maher would agree to hold negotiations on Egypt's accession to the "Middle East Command." London openly expressed regret. London newspapers believe that due to the Egyptian armed coup, the Hilaly government, which was conducting "successful" negotiations with the British government, was overthrown.

Imperialist conspiracies have been met with increasingly strong resistance from the people of the Middle East and Near East. The people of the Middle East and Near East want to overthrow the rule of the colonialists, whether British colonialists or American colonialists.

### 美国在中东和近东排挤着英国

    美国在中东和近东排挤着英国
    中东和近东向来就是帝国主义国家激烈争夺的场所。这个斗争的主要目的，首先是在于中东、近东国家的丰富资源，其中最重要的是石油。帝国主义之所以垂涎这个地区也由于它的战略地位，因为它是欧、亚、非三洲接壤的地方。
    在第二次世界大战以前，英国在争夺中东、近东的斗争中占上风。英帝国主义者占领了埃及、伊拉克、外约旦等国家、并在这一带建立了庞大的军事基地网——塞得港、苏彝士、亚丁、巴士拉、塞浦路斯等。英国把中东、近东国家开拓成为它的原料取给地，并以此作为大英帝国底实力基础之一。在半个世纪内，英国资本家仅仅在伊朗一地就取得了三亿吨以上的石油，获得的纯利共达五十亿美元。
    英帝国主义者在上世纪末占领了埃及，把它变为广大的棉花种植场，为兰开夏的纺织业巨头们提供廉价的、品质优良的原料。伊拉克变成了给英国提供廉价粮食特别是小麦与水果的地方。
    英帝国主义者一贯热心保护中东、近东地区，不让其他帝国主义掠夺者渗入。但是第二次世界大战削弱了大英帝国的力量，结果是情势改变了。美帝国主义早在战争时期就在这地区大事活动，而在沙特阿拉伯活动得更厉害。在战后的最初几年，美国已在土耳其建立了它的牢固的地位。
    不必详细说明：美国在近东、中东的积极活动，绝不是为了英国伙伴的利益的。
    美帝国主义者巩固了它在沙特阿拉伯与土耳其的地位后，就提出了这样一个问题：按照世界舞台上新的力量对比关系，美国在中东、近东所担任的角色也应有所改变。美国在一九四八年出版的小册子
    “美国在中东的利益”中清楚地提出了这个要求。小册子承认：第二次世界大战以后美国“官方”对伊朗、伊拉克和阿拉伯半岛的石油矿藏，“增加了许多倍的兴趣”。小册子坚决地主张美国不仅必须
    “直接参与”土耳其与沙特阿拉伯的事务，而且还必须干预这地区其他国家的事务。
    在一九四九和一九五○年间，美帝国主义者对英国在中东、近东一些国家的经济与政治阵地展开了猖狂的进攻；过去英国实际上在这些国家一直占着独占的地位。进攻的矛头首先指向伊朗。
    一九五一年春天，伊朗议会对人民的一致要求作了让步，通过了石油工业国有化与取消英伊石油公司的法案。那时候，美国政府并不忙于给英国人以支持。到了法案已经通过、英伊石油公司的权利在法律上已被剥夺的时候，美国政府才出面主张举行关于石油问题的英伊谈判。华盛顿事先就知道：英国绝不会同意国有化法案，谈判必遭失败，而且争论双方一定要请求美国政府“调停”。
    一九五一年六月伊朗政府与英伊石油公司代表举行的谈判果然没有获得任何结果。同年七—八月，美英伊三方谈判开始了。参加谈判的美国代表是百万富翁与政客哈里曼。哈里曼提出的提案主张给美国资本家以获得伊朗石油资源的锁钥。
    美帝国主义者的政策引起了伦敦金融界无比的愤怒。英国金融巨头的喉舌“经济学家”周刊公开地斥责美国的“出卖行为”。这种不满情绪是完全可以理解的。英国丢掉了对这一处石油资源的控制权；仅在一九五零年一年，英国就从这儿获得了约三千二百万吨的廉价石油供应。英国由于失去了伊朗的石油，就加深了对美国的依赖；今后英国得向大西洋彼岸的商人恳求石油了。
    表面上，美国对于伊朗石油问题，是和英国站在一起迫使伊朗接受一个放弃石油工业国有化政策的协定。但是，在幕后，美英两国仍然在继续斗争。证据是：今年五月“玫瑰玛利号”油船从伊朗运出了一千吨石油供给意大利新近成立的“爱皮姆”石油公司，可是这艘油船在亚丁湾被英国当局扣留了。以后才明白：原来“爱皮姆”公司的后台老板是美国石油商人。
    外约旦国王阿布杜拉的被刺对英帝国主义者是一个沉重的打击，因为他是执行英国在近东政策的主要头目之一。阿布杜拉是建立“大叙利亚”计划的主要支持者，这一计划就是要把叙利亚、伊拉克与外约旦三国在一个亲英的王朝之下联合起来。阿拉伯国家的报纸指出：阿布杜拉的被害是出于美国间谍之手。
    阿布杜拉死后，外约旦展开了争夺王位的幕后斗争。英国尽力反对合法的王位继承人、亲美的外约旦王子泰拉尔。泰拉尔不顾英国的阴谋阻挠，仍然继承父亲的王位。但是在今年五月间，泰拉尔被迫退位了，借口是说他好像患着神经病、不能管理国事。现在，亲英派人士组成的摄政委员会掌握着国家的最高权力。
    美英在叙利亚争夺权势的斗争，是十分激烈而且残酷的。这是因为什么呢？因为：第一，有些把阿拉伯半岛的石油输送到地中海沿岸一带的油管经过叙利亚领土；第二，这个国家在英国建立“大叙利亚”计划的实现中起着重大的作用。在一九四九年到一九五一年期间，这个不大的国家发生了四次政变。政变中发生了刺杀的事情。一九五一年十一月政变的结果，在叙利亚确立了军人集团的政权。据外国报纸说：这个集团是得到了美国支持的。
    目前美国在外交方面竭力利用英国在埃及所遭到的困难来谋取自己的利益。去年十月，埃及议会宣布了一九三六年订立的英埃条约无效，英国军队占领苏彝士运河地区就是根据这个条约的。这项决议是由于埃及人民的要求而采取的，埃及人民不能容忍别人占领自己的国土。在这一时期，华盛顿与伦敦之间进行了谈判；谈判的结果是：建立“中东司令部”的计划提出来了。这个计划规定美英军队占领埃及和其他中东、近东国家。英国赞成这个计划，实际上就是同意了以美英两国共同占领代替英国一国占领。
    但是，建立“中东司令部”的计划，提出容易、实现难。中东、近东国家的人民准确地看到了这计划对自己民族独立的威胁，并加以拒绝。
    这一计划加深了美英之间的矛盾。英国统治集团虽然同意了美国军队按照“中东司令部”计划开进中东、近东国家，可是还想保留对这些武装部队的控制权。伦敦坚决地主张由英国的将领来领导“中东司令部”。据“埃及人报”报道：这个问题最后拿到了在伦敦召开的美、英、法三国外交部长会议上讨论，但没有达成协议。美国报纸认为：建立“中东司令部”计划的出现，表明了英国在中东和近东的地位更进一步地削弱了。正如“美国新闻与世界报道”所说：目前“英国在这地区起不了大的作用了，但可以作美国的小伙计”。
    帝国主义者之间存在着的矛盾，绝不会妨碍它们在镇压民族解放斗争这一问题上面的共同行动。但是在这种情况下，每一个参加竞争的国家都在竭力巩固着自己的地位。
    美国报纸毫不加掩饰地说：由于美国外交家的活动，盖凡姆突然攫取了伊朗的政权。“纽约先驱论坛报”驻华盛顿记者陆塞尔说：华盛顿所“制订的扶助盖凡姆的计划”，力图“帮助盖凡姆在与伦敦进行关于石油问题谈判时期维持住政权”。
    同时美国报纸强调说：英国与盖凡姆政府之间的谈判要以国际复兴开发银行提出的建议为基础。大家都知道：这个建议规定伊朗放弃石油工业国有化政策，并且使美国资本有可能渗入伊朗。意味深长的是：英国报纸不像美国报纸那样，对于盖凡姆以伊朗首相的角色出现在舞台上并不表示欢迎，虽然英国不拒绝和他进行关于石油问题的谈判。
    盖凡姆在人民抗议的浪潮下被迫下台。美国报纸不得不承认：这对大洋彼岸的商人是一个打击。陆塞尔指出：“华盛顿的一切计划又要置之高阁了，华盛顿的官方人士又要忧虑不安了。”
    从许多外国报纸的报道中可以看出：埃及最近的政变与美国的阴谋有关，美国竭力想迅速解决按照美帝国主义扩张计划把埃及拖入“中东司令部”的问题。
    美国的报纸对这一点又不同于英国的报纸。美国报纸欢迎最近在纳吉布将军领导下进行的埃及武装政变。“华尔街日报”当时曾表示了：希望新首相马赫尔同意就埃及加入“中东司令部”问题举行谈判。伦敦却公开表示遗憾。伦敦报纸认为：由于埃及武装政变，正在和英国政府“顺利地”进行谈判的希拉里政府被推翻了。
    帝国主义的阴谋遭到了中东、近东国家人民日益强烈的反抗。中东、近东国家的人民要推翻殖民者的统治，不管英国殖民者还是美国殖民者。（原载八月七日苏联“劳动报”）  （新华社）
