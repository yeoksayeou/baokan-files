How I Became a Section Chief

To the Editor: I started working at the Shijingshan Power Plant at the age of fourteen, and the suffering I endured need not be mentioned. Two years ago, our plant underwent institutional reform and promoted me to become the chief of the Electrical Section. At the time, I dared not accept it. I thought: The state has entrusted me with such a large asset; what if I don't do a good job! Therefore, I felt like I was missing something as soon as I entered the office. Seeing the technical personnel sitting there, I was even more reluctant to do it; fearing that sitting in the office would "separate" me from the workers, I always wanted to run around on the shop floor. Once, when a transformer had an accident, I stayed by the transformer for two whole nights, neglecting all other work. Busy as I was all day long, accidents kept happening one after another. On one occasion, the motor of a circulating water pump on a certain machine broke down, and I immediately consulted with the veteran workers about repairing it. The solution was simple, but they raised a lot of difficulties. Just as I was getting anxious, the motor of the number three feed water pump also broke down. On Sunday, I wanted to mobilize everyone to work overtime to repair it, but some people simply asked for leave to go home. Just when I was at a loss, the Party comrade came to discuss with me how to eliminate accidents. At that time, I had no confidence. I thought: The Electrical Section has a large scope, spread out over a wide area, and the people are mixed. Electricity is something that you can't see or touch, so it's impossible not to have accidents. I even said, "I really can't do it!" This comrade criticized my erroneous thinking, pointing out that it was wrong for me not to have confidence in eliminating accidents. The main problem in the Electrical Section was that the masses had not been mobilized. Now, the first task was to launch a mass movement to eliminate accidents. Therefore, he stopped letting me run around and pulled me in to analyze the accidents. In this way, the causes of the accidents were found, and with the causes found, ways to overcome them were also found. Accidents could be eliminated. This made me suddenly realize that my previous thoughts and actions were wrong. We used various methods in the workshop to publicize the causes of accidents, and we uprooted the idea that "it is impossible not to have accidents." The whole workshop conducted a major safety inspection and found 188 hidden accidents. After that, we continuously won red flags for two months. From this incident, I deeply realized that with the correct leadership of the Party, all difficulties can be overcome.

    Under the Party's cultivation, education, and specific assistance, my ideological level has improved, and I have gradually found ways to work. Take meetings, for example. In the past, at meetings I chaired, I always had to make the concluding remarks, and when I got anxious, I couldn't speak. Some people would sarcastically say some backward things, such as, "Director, please make a conclusion quickly, we still have to get off work!" Later, I learned the methods of Party comrades in making conclusions and chairing meetings, paying special attention to everyone's speeches, then praising the correct parts of everyone's speeches, explaining the individual incorrect parts, and finally deciding how the work should be done. In this way, everything was well-organized. When the workers took technical classes, the section chiefs of other sections gave the lectures. At first, I couldn't do it myself, so I found someone else to do it. Later, when others were not available, I went to give the lectures myself. Gradually, I learned it too. Everyone said, "Director Tian is really something."

    One of my biggest shortcomings was that I didn't know how to care for and rely on the masses, and I didn't know how to promote the enthusiasm of the workers. This shortcoming has also been gradually overcome under the education of the Party. The rationalization proposals of our entire plant are developing vigorously. A rationalization proposal by the workers in the Electrical Section to improve the method of winding coils increased work efficiency dozens of times, and a reward should have been given. But I said, "Rewarding is just petty generosity." The workers were quite tired from work, and they had no water bottles to drink water from, so they asked for a bottle. But I said, "Did you come here to drink water or to work?" When repairing the transformer, the workers said they needed to be prepared for rain. I did not adopt their suggestion, so that work that could have been completed in twenty days actually took a month. The Party criticized my simple use of people's viewpoint of not caring about the workers and not valuing the workers' opinions, and I was determined to correct it. Once, when overhauling a large transformer that had never been overhauled before and the most important generator in the entire plant, we were able to rely on all the employees, overcome the difficulties, and complete the task on schedule. These facts made me realize the significance of the Party's constant education of me that "the revolutionary cause belongs to everyone, and everyone must be mobilized to do it."

    In the two years or so under the Party's cultivation, I have been constantly growing. I am convinced that after the workers become masters of their own affairs, they are fully capable of managing the country's enterprises well.

### 我是怎样当了场主任的

    我是怎样当了场主任的
    编辑同志：我从十四岁就在石景山发电厂干活，受的苦就不用提啦。前年我厂实行机构改革，把我提拔成了电气场的主任。当时说啥我也不敢干。我想：国家这样大的家当交给了我，干不好怎么办！因此，一进办公室就像短了什么似的。看见技术人员坐在那里，自己更不愿意干了；唯恐坐在办公室会“脱离”工人，总愿意到现场去跑跑。有一次变压器出了事故，我在变压器旁边整整呆了两晚，别的工作也都放下不管了。这样整天忙忙碌碌，事故也就一个接着一个。有一次，某号机循环水泵马达给烧坏了，我立刻去和老师傅们合计修理，办法本来很简单，人家却提出来一大堆困难。我正在着急，三号给水泵马达又给烧坏了。星期天我想动员大家加班修理，有的人就干脆请假回家了。我正在没法的时候，党的负责同志便来和我研究如何消灭事故的问题。当时我没有信心，我想：电气场摊子多、片大、人杂，电这玩艺儿又看不见、摸不着，不出事故是不可能的。我还说：“实在干不了！”这位同志批判了我的错误思想，指出我对消灭事故没有信心是不对的。电气场主要的问题是没有把群众发动起来，现在第一个问题就是展开群众性的消灭事故运动。于是，他不再让我东奔西跑，拉住我进行事故分析。这样，发生事故的原因就找到了；找到原因，也找到了克服的办法。事故原来是可以消灭的。这一来我猛然省悟了：自己从前的想法不对，做法也不对。我们在车间用各种方法宣传事故发生的原因，把“不出事故不可能”的思想连根拔掉了。全车间来了一次安全大检查，发现一百八十八件隐形事故。以后两个月就连续得了红旗。从这件事，我深刻认识到：有了党的正确领导，一切困难都是可以克服的。
    在党的培养、教育和具体帮助下，我的思想水平提高了，工作也慢慢有了办法。就说开会吧，从前我主持的会，最后总得由我作总结，一着急话就说不出来。有些人就冷言冷语说些落后话，什么“主任快作结论吧，还要下班呢！”后来我就学习党的同志作总结和主持会议的方法，特别注意大家的发言，然后对大家的发言中的正确部分加以表扬，个别不正确的就作解释，最后决定工作应该怎样做。这样就头头是道了。工人们学技术课，别的场都是场主任给上的，开始时，我自己不行，就找别人上，后来别人没有空，我自己也去上了。慢慢我也学会了。大家都说：“田主任真不简单了。”
    我一个最大的缺点就是不懂得关心群众和依靠群众，不知道如何发扬工人们的积极性。这一缺点在党的教育下也逐渐克服了。我们全厂的合理化建议在蓬蓬勃勃地开展着，电气场的工人们一个改进缠线圈的方法的合理化建议，使工作效率提高了几十倍，本来应该给奖。我却说：“要奖励是小米脑袋。”工人们干活挺累的，要喝水没壶，要求发一个壶。我却说：“你是喝水来的，还是干活来的？”修变压器时，工人们说要防备下雨。我没有采纳他们的意见，以致二十天可以作完的工作，竟干了一个月。党批评了我这种不关心工人、不重视工人意见的单纯使用观点，我痛下决心改正了它。有一次大修从未修过的大变压器和全厂最重要的某号发电机，由于能依靠全体职工，克服了困难，按期完成了任务。这些事实，使我体会到党经常教育我的“革命事业是大家的，要发动大家来做”的意义。
    两年多来在党的培养下，我不断地在成长着。我确信：工人当家作主后，是完全有力量管理好国家的企业的。    田家廉
