You Should Stand on the Side of Reality
-- Third Report from the Tianlan Railway Construction Site
By Our Correspondent Lu Hao

Practice is the best school. If an engineer is divorced from reality, even though he may possess considerable skills, he is like standing in the clouds. He may think higher than the sky, but the result will only be a waste of the people's millet and his own talent, which will not benefit the people.

Near the outskirts of Lanzhou, the terminal point of the Tianlan Railway, a fierce debate took place among engineers regarding the selection of the route.

This place is bordered by mountains on one side and close to the Yellow River on the other. When the Tianlan Railway arrives here, it must either pass through the mountain or cross the river滩 (tān) area beside the Yellow River.

In August 1951, engineers Luo Xiaozun and Chen Sirong from the Design Bureau of the Ministry of Railways arrived here to survey the route and decided that the railway should pass through the river滩 area beside the Yellow River.

To run a train on the river滩 area beside the Yellow River, the project is enormous. In the river滩 area, which is more than 300 meters long and more than 40 meters wide, it is necessary to fill it to a height of 14 meters. The rubble used for the roadbed foundation alone will require 53,000 cubic meters. Fifty-three thousand cubic meters of rubble is equivalent to moving a small stone mountain into the river滩.

In addition, it is necessary to construct 300 meters of slope protection, seven water diversion dams averaging about 20 meters in length, and a 108-meter-long earth retaining wall as auxiliary projects. All of these auxiliary projects must be built in the river滩.

Engineers Wang Jin-di, Gao Lan-sheng, and E Xian-jie on the site proposed another opinion. They said: It is unsafe to travel on the river灘 area, and suggested taking the tunnel line they had surveyed in May 1950. This line would pass through a 600-meter-long tunnel.

The debate began at this point. One side said the river灘 line could be used, and the other side said it was unsafe and uneconomical to use the river滩 line, and the tunnel line should be used.

Wang Jin-di's side said: "If the rubble is soaked in water for a long time, the foundation will be soft and will press down, which is dangerous."

Luo Xiaozun's side said: "We hope it will press down. If it presses down, we will fill it, and one day there will be a good foundation. This is the ideal excavation method."

In fact, Luo Xiaozun's words were completely untenable. In the river滩 area, the thin mud in some places was like chicken fat, and a bamboo pole could be inserted very deeply. After digging more than a foot, it became thinner and thinner as you dug. Wang Jin-di, Gao Lan-sheng, and others had done bearing capacity tests. During the test, the empty frame would move when placed on it. The foundation of the earth retaining wall was sometimes only visible after digging two feet; sometimes it was not visible even after digging two feet.

After looking at the route in the river滩 area, a water conservancy expert also completely overturned Luo Xiaozun's design. He believed that the subgrade of the river灘 line was susceptible to frost heaving, too close to the river, and easily scoured by the Yellow River, making the river滩 area route dangerous.

Gao Lan-sheng, E Xian-jie, and others were afraid that their experience was insufficient, and that they would make mistakes if they insisted on the high-level line. So they used their spare time, getting up early and going to bed late, to re-measure the tunnel line. The result of this measurement was that the tunnel was changed to 460 meters because it bypassed a small hill. This was 140 meters shorter than the original planned 600 meters. After calculation, compared with the river灘 line, it would save 1 billion in labor and material costs and shorten the line by 431 meters.

According to Luo Xiaozun's calculation, it is said that the savings in labor and material costs would be even more than 1 billion. In fact, this is a calculation by Luo Xiaozun and others that is divorced from reality. For example, one place was originally planned to be a large stone excavation of more than 20 meters, and these stones could be used as one of the sources to solve the 53,000 cubic meters of rubble. But in reality, there was only a little river-added stone in this place, and most of it was earthwork. What is even clearer is that just by traveling 431 meters less per train, it is estimated that 12 pairs of trains will run every day, and thousands of kilometers will be traveled less in a year. The maintenance of thousands of kilometers of lines and the consumption of coal, water, and locomotives is a huge loss.

Originally, learning could remedy the shortcomings of not understanding the actual situation, but because Luo Xiaozun was unwilling to learn, he could not see the clear facts in front of him. Luo Xiaozun said with such certainty: "We have considered more thoroughly than you. We have experience in using the 'Omega' line (because the river滩 line is Ω-shaped). It would be better for us to go back to the Ministry of Railways to compare."

Several months have passed since the matter, and the engineers on the site do not know whether a comparison has been made and what the result is. However, the construction of the river滩 line was ordered to begin on December 26, 1951.

At this time, two opinions appeared around Wang Jin-di. One was the opinion supporting Wang Jin-di: believing that the result should continue to be fought for. Many political workers also belonged to this opinion. They said:

"Not only do experts see that it is wrong, but laymen also see that it is wrong. We can see it, so why can't they see it?" The other was the opinion of giving up. They said: "If it is wrong, it is the fault of the engineers of the Ministry of Railways, and we have no responsibility." Wang Jin-di was a person who could persist in ideological struggle. He said: "It has not been clarified who is right. As long as my mouth can speak, I will make this matter clear."

In January 1952, when the Northwest Railway Trunk Line Engineering Bureau held a staff and worker representative conference, people elected Wang Jin-di as a staff and worker representative and said to him: "Old Wang, give them a speech at the conference, we all support you."

The issue of this route became one of the issues that attracted attention at the staff and worker representative conference. Although the person presiding over the staff and worker representative conference also supported Wang Jin-di's proposal and tried to make the views of both sides consistent, the debate still had no result because Luo Xiaozun and others simply did not listen to other people's opinions and always thought that their own views were brilliant.

The engineers on the site saw that things always had no results, and some were a little discouraged and planned to give up. They said: "Since the higher authorities already know about it, and since things cannot be done, then why bother." Some people kindly said to Wang Jin-di: "Some people say that you are showing off personal heroism. In my opinion, you can't twist your arm around your thigh, so forget it." However, more people have always supported Wang Jin-di's opinion. Wang Jin-di always insisted: "Engineers rely on science to do things, but they are divorced from reality, and the result must be wrong."

It was not until early March of this year that the large stone excavation of more than 20 meters originally planned by Luo Xiaozun and others, and the fact that most of it was actually earthwork, became completely clear. As a result, the problem became serious. Now, in addition to the more than 10,000 cubic meters of stone that have been gathered, the whereabouts of the other 40,000 cubic meters of stone are still unknown. Although two stone quarries were quickly opened 600 meters away from the river灘, producing more than 200 cubic meters of rubble every day, it was obvious that it would not be possible to collect the number of more than 50,000 cubic meters. In order not to affect the opening of the Tianlan Railway, we had to temporarily build a convenient line to pass through.

Since the river灘 line encountered difficulties, Wang Jin-di and Gao Lan-sheng brought up the tunnel line issue again, but the result was still a rebuff. The responsible comrade of the Design Bureau of the Ministry of Railways sent a telegram about this matter, which roughly said: The river滩 line is still the main line. If you work hard in construction, we will be fully responsible for the construction period and safety of the river灘 line.

Someone said to Wang Jin-di: "The Design Bureau of the Ministry of Railways is responsible for any problems that occur, so that's fine."

Wang Jin-di asked him: "If something goes wrong, aren't we responsible?"

Wang Jin-di, Gao Lan-sheng, and everyone who supported them persisted in their opinions until the end.

Truth finally judged the result of this meaningful debate. At the end of May this year, when the leading comrades of the Ministry of Railways and Soviet experts came to the Tianlan Railway to inspect the project, they learned about the opinions of Wang Jin-di and Gao Lan-sheng. The leading comrades and Soviet experts personally inspected the place and immediately accepted the good suggestion of changing to the tunnel line.

Those who were divorced from reality and worked based on their own subjective wishes lowered their heads to admit their mistakes at this time. However, this mistake was admitted too late, and the hundreds of billions of losses suffered by the country could not be repaid by a few of them. Our workers said it well: "We try our best to pick up a grain of sesame, but you effortlessly spill the oil basket. Isn't this a sin against the people?"

    你应该站在实际这一边
    ——天兰铁路工地见闻之三
    本报记者  陆灏
    实际是最好的学校。工程师要是离开了实际，他虽然有不小的本领，但他只好像站在云彩里，想得比天还高，但结果只会白白浪费人民的小米，浪费自己的才能，对于人民是没有什么好处的。
    在天兰铁路的终点兰州市郊的附近，工程师们关于线路的选择，曾发生过一场激烈的争论。
    这地方，一面傍山，一面紧靠黄河。天兰铁路到了这里，要就穿山过去，要就跨越黄河边的河滩地。
    一九五一年八月，铁道部设计局的工程师罗孝撙、陈思荣到了这里测量线路，决定了铁路要在黄河边的滩地上走过。
    要在黄河边的滩地上走火车，工程很大。在三百多公尺长、四十多公尺宽的河滩地，要填十四公尺高。单单路基基础所用的片石，就要五万三千方。五万三千方片石，等于要搬动一座小的石山到河滩里。
    另外，还要修筑三百公尺的护坡，七条平均二十公尺左右的挑水坝，一座一百零八公尺的御土墙的附属工程。而这些附属工程，又都全部是要在河滩里修建。
    现场的工程师王金第、高兰生、鄂先杰提出了另外一个意见。他们说：河滩地行车不安全，提议走一九五零年五月份他们曾经测量过的隧道线。这条线，要经过一座六百公尺的长隧道。
    争论是从这时候开始的。一边说河滩线能走，一边说走河滩线不安全，不经济，应该走隧道线。
    王金第这一边说：“片石长时间泡在水里，基础软，往下压，就有危险。”
    罗孝撙这一边说：“我们希望它往下压。它往下压，我们就填，总有一天会有好基础的。这是理想的开挖办法。”
    其实，罗孝撙的话根本站不住脚，那河滩地里，有的地方的稀泥就像鸡油似的，竹竿一插就可以插得很深。挖一尺多以后，就越挖越稀，王金第、高兰生等曾作过承载力的试验，试验的时候，空架子放上去都会移动，御土墙的基础，有的挖了两尺才见到底；有的挖了两尺还没有见到底。
    一位水利专家在看了河滩地的路线以后，也根本推翻了罗孝撙的设计，他认为河滩线的地基翻浆，距河太近，易被黄河冲刷，走河滩地是危险的。
    高兰生、鄂先杰等怕自己经验不足，怕坚持走高道线万一不慎，犯下错误。于是他们曾利用业余时间，早起晚睡，重新测量了一次隧道线。这一次测线的结果，因为绕过了一座小山头，隧道改成四百六十公尺。比原来计划的六百公尺，又缩短了一百四十公尺。经过计算，如和河滩线比较，要省工料费十亿，缩短线路四百三十一公尺。
    按照罗孝撙的算法，据说节省工料费要比十亿还多。实际上，这是罗孝撙等脱离实际的计算。譬如，有一个地方本来计划是二十多公尺的石头大挖方，这些石方，可以作为解决五万三千方片石的来源之一。但实际上这地方只有一点河加石，大部分是土方。事情更明白的是：仅仅每一趟车少走四百三十一公尺，按每天要开十二对车算，一年就要少走数千公里。数千公里的线路养护，煤、水、机车的消耗，是一笔多么大的损失。
    本来，学习可以补救不了解实际情况的缺点，但由于罗孝撙不肯学习，因而就看不见摆在他面前的鲜明事实。罗孝撙是那样肯定地说：“我们比你们考虑周到，我们走‘喔米加’线（因河滩线是?形）是有经验的，我们回到铁道部去比较好了。”
    事情已经过了几个月，是否进行了比较，结果怎样，现场上的工程师们不知道。但河滩线的工程，却奉命在一九五一年的十二月二十六日开始动工了。
    这时候，在王金第的周围出现了两种意见。一种是支持王金第的意见：认为应该继续争出一个结果来。很多政治工作人员也是属于这种意见。他们说：
    “不但内行看得不对头，就是外行也看得不对头。我们能看出来，为什么他们反看不出来呢？”另一种是打退堂鼓的意见。他们说：“错了也是铁道部工程师的错，我们是没有责任的。”王金第是一个能够坚持思想斗争的人，他说：“到底是谁对还没有弄清楚呀。只要我的嘴能说话，我就要把这件事情说清楚。”
    到了一九五二年一月，西北铁路干线工程局开职工代表会议的时候，人们推王金第为职工代表，并对他说：“老王，在大会上给他们发表发表，我们都支持你。”
    关于这条线路的问题，就成为职工代表会议引人注意的问题之一。主持职工代表会议的人虽然也支持王金第等的提议，并曾设法使双方的看法取得一致。但由于罗孝撙等根本不听别人的意见，总以为自己的看法高明，争论于是仍旧没有结果。
    现场上的工程师们，看见事情总是没有结果，有的就有点灰心，打算打退堂鼓了。他们说：“上级既然已经知道了，事情既然办不通，那又何必呢。”有的人好心地给王金第说：“有人说你在耍个人英雄主义呢，依我看，胳膊拧不过大腿，算了吧。”但是，更多的人是一直支持王金第的意见的。王金第始终坚持地认为：“工程师是依靠科学办事的，但他们却脱离了实际，结果一定是错的。”
    一直到了今年三月初，罗孝撙等原来计划是二十多公尺的石头大挖方，实际上大部分是土方已经完全成为事实。于是，问题就严重了，现在，除了已经聚集了一万多方石头以外，其他四万多方石头还没有着落。虽然很快在离河滩六百公尺远的地方开了两个石场，每天产片石两百多方，但要凑满五万多方的数目眼看是办不到的。为了不影响天兰铁路的通车，只好临时修一条便线通过去。
    河滩线既然遇到了困难，于是王金第、高兰生又把隧道线的问题提出来，结果仍旧是碰了钉子。铁道部设计局的负责同志为了这件事曾经发来了一个电报，电报大意说：仍以河滩线为正线，你们如施工认真，河滩线的工期和安全发生问题，我们完全负责。
    有人对王金第说：“发生问题由铁道部设计局负责，这可以算了。”
    王金第反问他说：“如果出了毛病，难道我们不负责了吗？”
    王金第、高兰生和一切支持他们的人，都把自己的意见坚持到最后。
    真理终于为这一场有意义的争论评判了结果。今年五月底，当铁道部的领导同志和苏联专家来到天兰铁路上视察工程的时候，他们知道了王金第和高兰生的意见，领导同志和苏联专家亲自视察了这个地方，并立即接受了改走隧道线的良好的建议。
    那些脱离实际，凭着自己主观愿望工作的人，这时候才低头承认错误。不过，这个错误承认得太晚了，它使国家受到的数百亿的损失不是他们几个人能偿还的。我们的工人同志们说得好：“我们用尽力量拣一粒芝麻，而你们却毫不费力地洒了油篓，这不是对人民的罪过吗？”
