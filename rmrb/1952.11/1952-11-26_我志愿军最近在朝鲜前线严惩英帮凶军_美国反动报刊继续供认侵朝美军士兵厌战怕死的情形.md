Xinhua News Agency, 25th: News from the Korean front by American news agencies admits that the British accomplice troops have recently been severely punished by the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. According to a United Press dispatch from the Western Front on the 19th: A regiment of the Scottish troops of the 29th Brigade of the British Commonwealth Division was "fiercely attacked by the Chinese army" on the evening of the 18th. "Before the attack, the Communist army bombarded with fierce artillery and mortar fire, the Scottish army suffered heavy casualties, and the Communist army occupied some forward positions of the federal forces."

Xinhua News Agency, 25th: American reactionary newspapers have recently continued to reveal some situations of American soldiers invading Korea being war-weary and afraid of death. According to the November 8th issue of the American "Collier's" magazine: Among the American troops on the Korean front, "about half of the soldiers do not fire their guns, or do not participate in the firefight at all." An American squad leader said: "Sometimes you send a squad to cover your flanks, there should be nine rifles firing, but all you hear is two or three rifles firing." Another American sergeant said: "I often have to expose myself, crawling from one foxhole to another, and can only get half of my platoon to fire. Sometimes, I actually have to aim for some soldiers and pull the trigger for them." The magazine confessed: "A platoon of the 38th Division collapsed during combat, they hardly fired a shot and brought back all their ammunition." The magazine claimed that the U.S. Army Department sent a brigadier general, known for studying the reasons why American soldiers do not fire their guns in combat, to the Korean battlefield to investigate, "Brigadier General Marshall found that fear can cause such fatigue that soldiers are too tired to fight or cannot fire their guns."

    我志愿军最近在朝鲜前线严惩英帮凶军
    美国反动报刊继续供认侵朝美军士兵厌战怕死的情形
    【新华社二十五日讯】美国通讯社从朝鲜前线发出的消息承认英国帮凶军最近受到中国人民志愿军的严惩。据美联社西线十九日电：英联邦师第二十九旅苏格兰部队的一个团，十八日晚“被中国军队猛攻”。“共军在攻击以前以猛烈的大炮和迫击炮炮火轰击，苏格兰军伤亡很大，共军占领了联邦军队的某些前进据点。”
    【新华社二十五日讯】美国反动报刊最近继续透露一些侵朝美军厌战怕死的情形。据十一月八日美国“柯里尔”杂志载称：朝鲜前线美军中“约有一半士兵不开枪，或根本不参加交火。”美军一个班长说：“有时你派一班人去掩护你的侧翼，应该有九支步枪开火，而你所听到的只有两三支步枪在开火。”另外一个美军军曹说：“我常常必须暴露我自己，从一个散兵坑爬到另外一个散兵坑，也只能使我那排的一半人开枪。有时，我实际上还得替一些士兵瞄准，再替他们扳动枪机。”该刊供称：“第三十八师的一个排在作战时崩溃了，他们几乎一枪未发，把所有弹药都带回来。”该刊称，美国陆军部派了一个以研究美国兵在作战时不开枪的原因闻名的准将到朝鲜战场去调查，“马霞尔准将发现，恐惧会造成这样的疲倦，使士兵疲倦得不能作战或不能开枪。”
