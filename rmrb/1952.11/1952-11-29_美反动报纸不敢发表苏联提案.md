Xinhua News Agency, New York, November 27th: Although American bourgeois newspapers have devoted much space under large headlines to news about the United Nations' discussion of the Korean question, they have completely concealed from their readers the Soviet proposal for an immediate ceasefire in Korea. The newspapers apparently dare not let the masses know that such a proposal exists, and dare not let the masses know that while other delegations are busy drafting and revising proposals aimed at continuing the Korean War, the Soviet Union has put forward a clear suggestion for ending the war and promoting peace in Korea.

The "New York Times," which boasts of "reporting everything," only briefly mentioned the Soviet proposal in an article commenting on the Korean question. As for the "New York Herald Tribune," the "New York Post," the "New York World-Telegram and Sun" and other newspapers, they did not even mention the Soviet proposal at all. Only the "Daily Worker" published news about the Soviet proposal in a prominent position.

    美反动报纸不敢发表苏联提案
    【新华社二十八日讯】据塔斯社纽约二十七日讯：美国资产阶级报纸虽然在大字标题下用许多篇幅刊载联合国讨论朝鲜问题的消息，但是却对他们的读者完全隐瞒了苏联提出的在朝鲜立即停火的提案。各报显然不敢让群众知道有这样一个提案存在，并且不敢让群众知道，在其他代表团忙于拟订和修改旨在继续朝鲜战争的提案的时候，苏联却提出了一个结束战争、促成朝鲜和平的明确建议。
    自吹“有闻必录”的“纽约时报”，仅在一篇评论朝鲜问题的文章中简略地提到一下苏联提案。至于“纽约先驱论坛报”、“纽约邮报”、“纽约世界电讯太阳报”及其他报纸甚至完全没有提到苏联提案。只有“工人日报”以显著的地位发表了关于苏联提案的消息。
