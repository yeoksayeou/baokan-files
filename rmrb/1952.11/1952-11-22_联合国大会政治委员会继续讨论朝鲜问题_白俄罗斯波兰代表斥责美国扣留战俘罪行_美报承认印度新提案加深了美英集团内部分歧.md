Xinhua News Agency, New York, 21st: According to TASS, the Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly continued its discussion of the Korean issue on the 17th and 19th. At the meeting on the 17th, the chairman announced the cancellation of the meeting originally scheduled for the 18th because representatives who were scheduled to speak had postponed their speeches to the 19th. It is clear that the American representatives have not yet gathered the necessary votes to quickly pass its proposal in the Political Committee.

It should be pointed out that the New York newspapers have openly expressed dissatisfaction that the Seventh General Assembly has not made a "decision" on the Korean issue that pleases the American ruling clique. The New York Herald Tribune mentioned the "crisis" of the United Nations on November 18 and emphasized that the burden borne by the United States in Korea is getting heavier and heavier.

The Peruvian representative spoke at the meeting on the 17th. A large part of his speech called for not emphasizing the differences of opinion between the delegations, but accepting the US proposal as a basis. The Peruvian representative expressed full support for the US military headquarters' attitude of refusing to repatriate prisoners of war. The Peruvian representative said that according to his proposal, the North Korean and Chinese prisoners of war could be sent to so-called trusteeship areas managed by colonial countries. In this way, he inadvertently revealed the conspiracy of the United States and Britain to turn North Korean and Chinese prisoners of war into slaves in imperialist colonies.

The second speaker was the head of the delegation of the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic, Kiselev. He said: The whole world knows that the organizers and masters of the Korean War are the US ruling clique, and that the US military headquarters should be held fully responsible for the interruption of the armistice negotiations. Kiselev then cited many facts to prove that in order to forcibly detain North Korean and Chinese prisoners of war, so as to hand them over to the Syngman Rhee and Kuomintang cliques and use them as cannon fodder, the United States is carrying out large-scale torture and slaughter of North Korean and Chinese prisoners of war. Kiselev said that the representatives of the Political Committee should demand that the US military command in Korea stop the massacre, torture, insult, forced signing, intimidation and detention of prisoners of war; they should demand that the US military command guarantee the prisoners of war enjoy human rights and living conditions prescribed by international law. Kiselev finally requested the Political Committee to pass the Soviet delegation's proposal on the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue.

At the meeting of the Political Committee on November 19, the speakers included the Polish representative Naszkowski and the Indian representative Menon.

The Polish representative pointed out that the discussion on the Korean issue in the Political Committee so far has not promoted a ceasefire, nor has it brought the end of the Korean War any closer than before, and expressed regret for this. He asked the committee to pay attention to the telegram sent by the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Park Heun-young, to the President of the United Nations General Assembly on November 8 this year. Park Heun-young informed the General Assembly of the unprecedented crimes committed by the American aggressors against civilians and demanded that the General Assembly take measures to stop such barbaric behavior. Naszkowski said that if the prisoner of war issue is not resolved correctly and fairly, the Korean War cannot be resolved correctly and fairly. Leaving the prisoners of war in the hands of the United States would mean creating a threat of new wars and new provocations, and would violate humanitarian principles. Naszkowski finally expressed full support for the Soviet proposal.

The Indian representative Menon urged the United Nations to resolve the Korean issue and achieve peace and unification in Korea. He emphasized that the absence of legitimate Chinese representatives at the United Nations meetings is a serious obstacle to resolving the Korean issue. Menon said that he put forward his proposal to the committee from the premise that both sides in the Korean War hope to end the war. He said that the task of the Indian proposal is to "reconcile the differences of opinion" on the issue of repatriation of prisoners of war.

The Indian delegation's proposal stipulates the establishment of a repatriation of prisoners of war committee composed of representatives from Czechoslovakia, Poland, Sweden and Switzerland. The committee must elect a fifth member – an arbitrator – within three weeks of the start of its work. All prisoners of war are under the management of the committee and are subsequently repatriated. The issue of prisoners of war who have not been repatriated within ninety days will be submitted to the political conference stipulated in the draft armistice agreement agreed upon by both sides at the Panmunjom negotiations.

The Indian proposal points out that there is already a great degree of agreement on the principles, according to which this issue that divides the two sides (that is, the issue of the repatriation of prisoners of war) can be resolved. However, everyone knows that the US military headquarters refuses to repatriate all prisoners of war. The US authorities have wantonly undermined the international law which stipulates the immediate repatriation of all prisoners of war after the cessation of hostilities, and the US delegation and the representatives of some countries that support the US aggression against Korea have repeatedly defended the actions of the US military headquarters and the US authorities.

While emphasizing that, according to the 1949 Geneva Convention, after the cessation of hostilities, all parties concerned in the Korean War should immediately repatriate prisoners of war, and international law prohibits the forced detention of prisoners of war, the Indian representative said at the same time that a situation may arise in which not all prisoners of war are repatriated home. His explanation shows that during the complex procedures for the repatriation of prisoners of war stipulated in the Indian proposal, the issue of prisoners of war may be submitted to the United Nations General Assembly again, and the prisoners of war may still be detained in prisoner of war camps. The proposal says: Force should not be used against prisoners of war for any purpose – to prevent them from going home or to force them to go home. In this way, the Indian proposal repeated the US delegation's notorious statement that there should be no "forced repatriation," although everyone knows that the US military headquarters is using the statement that there should be no "forced repatriation" to conceal its intention to use force to detain prisoners of war.

The New York newspapers have published these words in the Indian proposal in a particularly prominent position. For example, the New York Times emphasized on November 20 that the new proposal adopts the principles of the American proposal. At the same time, American newspapers have expressed opposition to India's proposal to establish a committee composed of representatives from Czechoslovakia, Poland, Sweden and Switzerland. American newspapers also believe that the part of the Indian proposal that stipulates that the issue of prisoners of war who have not been repatriated within ninety days should be submitted to a political conference is unacceptable.

The Indian representative's speech proves that many delegations in the United Nations are anxious because the United States has taken various means to delay the Korean issue; the pressure of world public opinion has forced representatives of some countries to oppose the US proposal in various ways.

"US News and World Report" pointed out that the United States is bound to be subjected to greater criticism in the United Nations. The new proposal on the issue of repatriation of prisoners of war put forward by the Indian delegation has further deepened the divisions between the United States and its allies.

It is worth noting that neither the US delegation nor the British delegation is now actively defending their attitude at the meeting, but are concentrating their efforts on behind-the-scenes negotiations and conspiracies outside the meeting. Up to now, neither the US nor British delegations in the Political Committee have responded to the recent speeches by the head of the Soviet delegation or the heads of the Ukrainian, Belarusian, Polish and Czechoslovak delegations.

### 联合国大会政治委员会继续讨论朝鲜问题  白俄罗斯波兰代表斥责美国扣留战俘罪行  美报承认印度新提案加深了美英集团内部分歧

    联合国大会政治委员会继续讨论朝鲜问题
    白俄罗斯波兰代表斥责美国扣留战俘罪行
    美报承认印度新提案加深了美英集团内部分歧
    【新华社二十一日讯】据塔斯社纽约讯：联合国大会政治委员会于十七、十九两日继续讨论朝鲜问题。在十七日的会议上，主席宣布取消原定于十八日举行的会议。因为要发言的代表已延期到十九日发言。很明显，美国代表还没有搜罗到必要的票数，在政治委员会急速通过它的提案。
    应该指出，纽约报纸已对第七届大会没有在朝鲜问题做出美国统治集团中意的“决定”，公开表示了不满。纽约先驱论坛报在十一月十八日提到联合国的“危机”，并强调说美国在朝鲜所担负的担子愈来愈重了。
    秘鲁代表在十七日的会议上发言，他的演说有很大一部分是要求不要强调各代表团之间的意见分歧，而接受美国的提案为基础。秘鲁代表表示完全支持美军司令部拒绝遣返战俘的态度。秘鲁代表说，根据他的提案，朝中战俘可以送往由殖民国家管理的所谓托管地区。这样，他就在无意中透露了美英两国把朝中战俘变成帝国主义殖民地奴隶的阴谋。
    第二个发言的是白俄罗斯共和国代表团团长基塞列夫。他说：全世界都清楚地知道朝鲜战争的组织者和主持者是美国统治集团，并知道停战谈判的中断应由美军司令部完全负责。基塞列夫接着举出了许多事实证明，美国为了强迫扣留朝中战俘，以便把他们交给李承晚和国民党集团，利用他们充当炮灰，正在大规模地拷打和屠杀朝中战俘。基塞列夫说，政治委员会的代表们应当要求朝鲜美军司令部停止对战俘屠杀、酷刑、侮辱、强迫签字、恫吓、禁闭；应当要求美军司令部保证战俘享有人权和国际法所规定的生活条件。基塞列夫最后要求政治委员会通过苏联代表团关于和平解决朝鲜问题的提案。
    在政治委员会十一月十九日的会议上发言的有波兰代表纳斯科夫斯基和印度代表梅农。
    波兰代表指出，政治委员会上关于朝鲜问题的讨论迄今为止还没有促成停火，也没有使朝鲜战争的结束比以前接近一些，并对此表示遗憾。他要求委员会注意朝鲜民主主义人民共和国外务相朴宪永于今年十一月八日拍给联合国大会主席的电报，朴宪永把美国侵略者对平民所犯的史无前例的罪行告诉了大会，并要求大会采取措施制止这种野蛮行为。纳斯科夫斯基说，假如战俘问题得不到正确的、公正的解决，朝鲜战争就得不到正确的、公正的解决。把战俘留在美国手里，就会意味着产生新战争、新挑衅的威胁，并且违反人道原则。纳斯科夫斯基最后表示完全支持苏联的提案。
    印度代表梅农敦促联合国解决朝鲜问题、实现朝鲜的和平与统一。他强调指出：联合国会议中没有合法的中国代表出席，是解决朝鲜问题的严重障碍。梅农说，他向委员会提出他的提案，是从这样一个前提出发的：朝鲜战争的双方都希望结束战争。他说印度提案的任务，是要把遣返战俘问题上的“不同意见加以调和”。
    印度代表团提出的提案中规定成立一个由捷克斯洛伐克、波兰、瑞典与瑞士的代表组成的遣返战俘委员会。委员会必须在开始工作后三星期内选出第五个委员——仲裁人。全部战俘概归委员会管理，随后加以遣返。在九十天内未遣返的战俘的问题则提交双方在板门店谈判中议定的、停战协定草案规定召开的政治会议。
    印度提案指出：目前对原则已有很大程度的协议，根据这些原则就可以解决这个使双方分歧的问题（就是战俘遣返问题）。但是大家知道，美军司令部拒绝遣返全部战俘。美国当局横暴地破坏了规定在战争停止后立即遣返全部战俘的国际法，而美国代表团与某些支持美国侵略朝鲜的国家代表却一再地替美军司令部和美国当局这种行为辩解。
    印度代表一面强调指出，根据一九四九年日内瓦公约，在战事停止后，朝鲜战争的有关各方应该立即遣返战俘，国际法禁止强迫扣留战俘；但是他同时又说，可能发生这样一种情况，就是并不是所有的战俘都被遣返回家。他所作的解释说明：在实施印度提案所规定的遣返战俘的复杂手续当中，遣俘问题可能再度提交联合国大会，战俘可能仍被扣留在战俘营中。提案说：不论为了什么目的——阻止他们回家或强迫他们回家，对战俘都不能使用武力。这样，印度提案就把美国代表团关于臭名远扬的不得“强迫遣返”的说法重复了一遍，虽然大家知道，美军司令部是用不得“强迫遣返”的说法来掩饰它使用武力扣留战俘的意图。
    纽约报纸都以特别显著的地位刊载印度提案中的这些话，如“纽约时报”就在十一月二十日强调说：新提案采纳了美国提案的原则。同时，美国报纸表示反对印度关于成立一个由捷克斯洛伐克、波兰、瑞典和瑞士代表组成的委员会的建议。美国报纸也认为印度提案中规定将九十天内尚未遣返的战俘的问题提交政治会议处理的部分是不能接受的。
    印度代表的演说证明，联合国中许多代表团都因为美国采取种种拖延朝鲜问题的手段而焦急不安；世界舆论的压力已使得若干国家的代表都不得不以各种不同的方式反对美国的提案。
    “美国新闻与世界报道”指出，美国在联合国必定要受到更大的批评。印度代表团所提出的关于遣返战俘问题的新提案已进一步加深了美国与其盟国之间的分歧。
    值得注意的是，不论是美国代表团或英国代表团现在都不再在会议上积极地为他们的态度辩护，而是在会外集中力量进行幕后谈判和阴谋。直到现在为止，在政治委员会中美英两国代表团对于苏联代表团团长或是乌克兰、白俄罗斯、波兰和捷克斯洛伐克代表团团长们最近的发言都没有任何反应。
