　　Xinhua News Agency, November 13th: The Central Headquarters and the Beijing Municipal Branch of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang held a memorial meeting for the 86th anniversary of Mr. Sun Yat-sen's birth at the headquarters auditorium on the afternoon of November 12th. Those present included Li Jishen, Chairman of the Central Committee; Central Committee members He Xiangning, Liu Yazi, Chen Shaoxian, Long Yun, Jiang Guangnai, Mei Gongbin, Wang Kunlun, Qu Wu, and Li Junlong; Solidarity Committee members Sun Yueqi, Li Zheng, and Wang Shuchang; Municipal Branch members Xu Baoqi, Fu Xuewen, Ding Guitang, and Zhang Youjiang; as well as all cadres from the headquarters and municipal branch, and all heads of grassroots organizations.
　　The conference was addressed by Chairman Li Jishen, entitled "Promote Mr. Sun Yat-sen's Spirit of Learning from Russia." He pointed out: Mr. Sun Yat-sen was the earliest enlightened person in China to call for "learning from Russia." He recognized that the Chinese revolution must follow the example of the Soviet Union, and in action, made the then-Chinese revolutionary movement receive help from the Soviet Union. This was the height of Mr. Sun's revolutionary career and revolutionary thought. Today, as we commemorate Mr. Sun Yat-sen, we should review his historical process of "learning from Russia" and work even harder to learn from the Soviet Union and promote his spirit of "learning from Russia." Li Jishen said: "Historical facts tell us that it is impossible for the Chinese people to further learn from the Soviet Union without the leadership of the working class. Now, revolutionary China, under the leadership of the working class, has greatly developed the road of learning from Russia. Today, as we commemorate Mr. Sun Yat-sen, we must work harder to learn from the Soviet Union, learn from the Soviet people's selfless spirit of labor, learn from the Soviet people's advanced construction experience, and learn from the Soviet people's great spirit of combining patriotism and internationalism. Only in this way can we develop Mr. Sun Yat-sen's spirit of 'learning from Russia'; only in this way can we, under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, work together with the people of the whole country to make tomorrow's China follow the path of today's Soviet Union."
　　Following this, He Xiangning, a member of the Standing Committee of the Central Committee, spoke, saying: Today, as we commemorate Mr. Sun Yat-sen, we must recognize the importance of consolidating and developing the great friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people. Our great motherland has achieved brilliant achievements in all aspects of construction in the past three years, thanks to the selfless assistance of the Soviet Union. It can be said that today we have not only achieved the revolutionary goal of "seeking freedom and equality for China" as required by Mr. Sun Yat-sen, but also followed the path of "learning from Russia" and made great progress, moving from new democratic construction towards the grand prospect of socialist and communist construction.
　　Finally, Solidarity Committee member Qu Wu conveyed the report of Soviet delegation leader Tikhonov. The memorial meeting proceeded in a solemn and enthusiastic atmosphere throughout.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, November 13th: People from all walks of life in Nanjing commemorated the 86th anniversary of Mr. Sun Yat-sen's birth by laying wreaths and paying respects at the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum on the morning of the 12th. Those who participated in the ceremony included Ke Qingshi, Mayor of Nanjing; Chen Heqin, Vice Chairman of the Nanjing Municipal People's Representative Conference Consultative Committee; Shao Hengqiu, convener of the Nanjing Municipal Branch of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang; and more than 30 representatives from local organizations of various democratic parties and mass organizations.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, November 13th: November 12th was the 86th anniversary of Mr. Sun Yat-sen's birth. Pan Hannian and Sheng Pi Hua, Deputy Mayors of Shanghai, Jin Zhonghua, Vice Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Consultative Committee, and representatives from local organizations of various democratic parties and people from all walks of life, including Wu Yiwu, Wu Yun Chu, Gu Zhizhong, Li Zhaohuan, and Zhao Zukang, visited Mr. Sun Yat-sen's former residence on Xiangshan Road, paid their respects, and laid wreaths.

    民革举行孙中山先生诞辰纪念会
    南京各界代表谒中山陵上海各界代表瞻仰孙先生故居
    【新华社十三日讯】中国国民党革命委员会中央总部和北京市分部十一月十二日下午在总部大礼堂举行孙中山先生八十六周年诞辰纪念会，到中央委员会主席李济深，中委何香凝、柳亚子、陈劭先、龙云、蒋光鼐、梅龚彬、王昆仑、屈武、李俊龙等，团结委员孙越崎、李蒸、王树常等，市分部委员许宝骙、傅学文、丁贵堂、章友江等，及总部、市分部全体干部和基层组织全体负责人。
    大会由李济深主席报告，题为“发扬孙中山先生以俄为师的精神”。他指出：中山先生是中国最早号召“以俄为师”的先觉者。他认识到中国革命必须效法苏联，而且在行动上使当时中国革命运动得到苏联的帮助。这是中山先生一生革命事业与革命思想的高度发展。今天我们来纪念中山先生，就应当温习一下他当日“以俄为师”的历史过程，并且要更加努力学习苏联发扬他“以俄为师”的精神。李济深说：“历史的事实告诉我们，中国人民要想进一步地学习苏联，不是在工人阶级领导之下是不可能的。现在革命胜利的中国，已经在工人阶级领导之下，把以俄为师的道路更大地发展了。我们今天纪念中山先生，只有更加努力向苏联学习，学习苏联人民忘我的劳动精神，学习苏联人民的先进建设经验，学习苏联人民爱国主义与国际主义相结合的伟大精神。只有这样，我们才是发展了中山先生当日‘以俄为师’的精神；只有这样，我们才能在毛主席和中国共产党领导之下，和全国人民共同努力，使明日的中国走向今日的苏联的道路。”
    继由中常委何香凝讲话，她说：我们今天来纪念孙中山先生更要认识到巩固和发展中苏两国人民伟大友谊的重要意义。我们伟大的祖国三年来在各方面的建设，由于苏联至公无私的援助，获得了辉煌的成就。可以说我们今日不只是达到了孙中山先生所要求的“求中国之自由平等”的革命目的；而且还依照“以俄为师”的道路，大大向前发展，将由新民主主义建设，走向社会主义建设和共产主义建设的远大前途。
    最后由团结委员屈武传达苏联代表团团长吉洪诺夫的报告，纪念会始终在精神严肃、情绪热烈中进行。
    【新华社南京十三日电】南京市各界人民纪念孙中山先生诞生八十六周年，在十二日上午前往中山陵献花圈并谒陵。参加谒陵的有：南京市人民政府市长柯庆施、南京市各界人民代表会议协商委员会副主席陈鹤琴、中国国民党革命委员会南京市分部常委召集人邵恒秋等及各民主党派地方组织、各群众团体代表等三十多人。
