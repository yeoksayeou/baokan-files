    The Wujiang River: Yesterday and Today
    Ji Liang
    In the southwest of our motherland, there is a torrential river that plunges down from the Wumeng Mountains in Weining County, Guizhou, traverses the interior of Guizhou, and joins the Yangtze River at Fuling, passing through Pengshui and Wulong counties in Sichuan; this is the famous Wujiang River. The autumn scenery in the Wujiang River basin is very beautiful. In this beautiful season, I came to the Wujiang River once again. As I sailed into the Wujiang River, I deeply felt that the Wujiang River had changed. Flocks of white cranes soared over the Wujiang River, and the ripe red pomegranates on both banks reflected the wilderness. Thousands upon thousands of wooden boats, fully loaded with tung oil, wood oil, lacquer, ramie, gallnuts, and other local and special products abundant in the Wujiang River basin, as well as a large amount of edible salt and various daily necessities needed by the more than three million people along the river, traveled back and forth incessantly. The boatmen happily pulled the towlines and sang songs. The Wujiang River was filled with scenes of happiness and joy everywhere.
    The Wujiang River is an important waterway connecting seventeen counties along the river with the outside world. Transportation in the Wujiang River basin relies mostly on wooden boats, but in the past, the wooden boat workers lived a life of slavery. Anyone who had been to the Wujiang River cursed it as a dark hell on earth. At that time, twenty-eight feudal groups dominated the Wujiang River, establishing a barbaric "slave kingdom" there. The wooden boat workers had no wages, no freedom, and were completely the "private property" of the feudal bosses. The feudal bosses could arbitrarily punish workers by "submerging them in water prisons," washing their feet with salt water, and using two wooden boats to "sandwich meat patties," torturing the workers to death. Day and night, the wooden boat workers, without rest, on the knife-cut cliffs on both sides of the Wujiang River, bare-bodied and barefoot, pulled the heavy, primitive "crooked-butt wooden boats," while the feudal bosses whipped them from behind. The people on both sides of the Wujiang River said: Every wooden boat had twenty-one workers, and two or three people would die on each trip from Fuling to Gongtan on the border of Sichuan and Guizhou. The wooden boat workers sadly called themselves "eating with a spirit tablet in hand." Wooden boat worker Luo Ziyun told me: One autumn four years before liberation, the feudal boss Liu Bingzhang once escorted thirty-two workers in the middle of the night to pull a wooden boat to Pengshui; the boat reached Yangjiao Creek in the afternoon, and the workers had not yet eaten, but Liu Bingzhang kept beating the workers with wooden sticks and stones, forcing them to cross the turbulent and treacherous Five Mile Long Shoal. The workers were exhausted and could not withstand the impact of the water from the Five Mile Long Shoal, and all of them capsized and died in the river on a small boat. For hundreds of years, the wooden boat workers had lived through years of suffering on this disaster-ridden Wujiang River. The rich local and special products of the Wujiang River basin could not be transported out in large quantities, and the daily necessities of the more than three million people along the river were extremely scarce.
    Now, the Wujiang River has completely changed its old appearance.
    Last October, under the leadership of the local Communist Party organization, the wooden boat workers of the Wujiang River launched a vigorous struggle against the feudal bosses. The wooden boat workers saw with their own eyes the feudal bosses who used to beat workers, kill workers, and commit heinous crimes fall before them. They were forever free from the whippings, massacres, and nocturnal slave life of the feudal bosses. The wooden boat workers are now the masters of the Wujiang River, raising their white sails and sailing with the wind. Every night when the wooden boats dock, the wooden boat workers change into brand-new clothes and stroll leisurely in groups of two or three. On the docks along the Wujiang River in Fuling County, there is a row of neat tile-roofed houses, which were specially allocated to the wooden boat workers by the people's government after liberation. In Qingxigou, a scenic spot five or six miles away from Fuling County, there is a piece of land of more than ninety mu, where three beautiful buildings are being built, which are also dormitories for the wooden boat workers. The lives of the workers have improved significantly. They all say that they have gone from "hell" to "heaven." Take Chen Yinchang, a young worker, for example. His family has many members, and their economic life is of a medium level. He and his father pulled boats for the feudal boss Zou Bingquan for more than ten years, and they were so poor that they couldn't even afford pants. The whole family lived in a stone cave on the bank of the Wujiang River, and for eight months of the year, they lived by eating wild vegetables and Guanyin soil. After liberation, they were allocated three spacious large thatched houses and two small thatched houses, and moved out of the dark and humid stone cave where they had lived for more than ten years. This year, in addition to the whole year's food, his family also bought two pigs and five sheep, and Chen Yinchang and his father also sewed three pieces of clothing each. This young worker also especially told me that he had gotten married. This is indeed a joyous event. In the past, many wooden boat workers lived a life of bachelorhood under the exploitation and oppression of the feudal bosses. The situation is different now. Even Cai Yuxiang, who is forty-four years old, is preparing to get married. Cai Yuxiang is an old worker who worked as a "long-term worker" (that is, a slave to the boss, without wages or freedom) for the feudal boss for thirteen years. Thirteen years of slave life tortured him with coughing and spitting blood. In the year before liberation, the feudal boss saw that Cai Yuxiang could no longer work and drove him out. After liberation, the Fuling Wooden Boat Workers' Union found him again. Now his hemoptysis has also improved. When I visited him, he was wearing two layers of new clothes, an inner white shirt of dragon-head fine cloth and an outer blue jacket. He told me that he had lived for more than forty years without wearing trousers, and wore a torn long gown all year round, sleeping under the eaves in summer and next to the fire in winter, eating pepper-mixed-with-sand rice. He said happily: "Now I live in the workers' dormitory, with bedding and blankets, three meals of rice a day, and a big feast every five days, with vegetables and meat, which is really different from before!"
    There are many wooden boat workers like Cai Yuxiang on the Wujiang River. They have escaped from the sea of ​​suffering and are living a happy life. In order to live a better life, they fight the dangerous shoals and rapids of the Wujiang River with their labor and wisdom, making the Wujiang River, which has always been regarded as a "natural barrier," tame. The saying that used to circulate on the Wujiang River, "Three wooden wheels go down to Fuling, and only one reaches to guarantee the capital," no longer exists. This year, there have been very few wooden boat accidents in the first half of the year. On the Wujiang River, I also saw newly built "Dragon-Snatching Boats" traveling upstream in groups. The workers told me that this kind of boat could only sail on the Yangtze River in the past, but now it has safely entered the Wujiang River. In the past, each wooden boat could only carry 17.5 tons of salt and traveled twice a year; now it can carry 24 tons, and this year from January to June, each boat has traveled an average of four to six times. Some boats have even created a record of carrying 47 tons downstream. Due to the high enthusiasm of the wooden boat workers, the transportation efficiency has been improved. In the first half of this year, the amount of local and special products transported from various places along the river increased by 97% compared with the whole year of 1951; in the first half of this year, the amount of edible salt and various daily necessities transported in increased by 61.6% compared with the first half of 1951. This stopped the falling of the excessively low prices of local and special products and turned it upwards. The scissors difference between agricultural products and industrial products in the Wujiang River basin gradually narrowed. For example, in Mugen Township, Wulong County, five liters of corn used to be exchanged for one kilogram of salt, but now one liter of corn can be exchanged for one kilogram of salt, which has strongly promoted the economic prosperity of the Wujiang River basin.

    乌江的昨天和今天
    集良
    在祖国的西南有一条奔腾的激流，从贵州威宁县乌蒙山倾泻下来，横贯贵州腹部经四川彭水、武隆等县至涪陵与长江会合；这就是有名的乌江。乌江流域的秋天是很美丽的，在这美丽的季节里，我又一次来到了乌江。当我乘船驶入乌江的时候，深深感到乌江变了。群群白鹤翱翔在乌江上空，两岸熟透了的红石榴，映照山野。成千上万的木船满载了乌江流域盛产的桐油、木油、漆、麻、倍子等土、特产和沿江三百多万人民需用的大宗食盐及各项日用品，往来不停。船工们愉快地拉纤、歌唱，乌江到处充满了幸福和欢乐的景象。
    乌江是沟通沿江十七个县对外交通的一条重要河道。乌江流域运输绝大部分依靠木船，而木船工人在过去却过着奴隶般的生活。凡是到过乌江的人，都曾经诅咒过乌江是一个黑暗的人间地狱，那时，有二十八个封建集团霸占着乌江，在这里建立起一个野蛮的“奴隶王国”。木船工人没有工资，没有自由，完全成为封建把头的“私有财产”。封建把头可以随意罚工人“下水牢”，用盐水洗脚板和用两只木船“挟肉饼”等酷刑，将工人处死。木船工人昼夜不休息地在乌江两岸刀削似的悬崖上，赤着身，光着脚，拉着笨重的原始的“歪屁股木船”，封建把头在后面鞭打着。乌江两岸的人们这样说：每只木船二十一个工人，从涪陵到川黔边境的龚滩走一次船就要死掉两三个人。木船工人都沉痛地称自己是“端起灵牌吃饭”。木船工人罗子云告诉我：解放前四年的一个秋天，封建把头刘炳章有一次半夜里押着三十二个工人，拉一只木船到彭水去；船赶到羊角溪已是下午时候，工人还没有吃饭，刘炳章却不停地用木棒、石头打工人，强迫着工人抢渡汹涌险恶的五里长滩。工人们精疲力竭，抵不住五里长滩江水的冲击，就在一只小船上，全部倾覆江中牺牲了。几百年来木船工人就在这灾难重重的乌江上，过着苦难的岁月。乌江流域丰富的土、特产品不能大量外运，沿江三百多万人民的日用必需品极端缺乏。
    现在，乌江已完全改变了旧日的面貌。
    去年十月，乌江木船工人在当地共产党组织的领导下，展开了轰轰烈烈的反封建把头斗争。木船工人亲眼看到过去打工人、杀工人、罪大恶极的封建把头在自己的面前倒下去了。他们永远摆脱了封建把头的鞭打、屠杀和夜间被关起来的奴隶生活了。木船工人如今是乌江的主人，他们扬起白帆，顺风航行。每当木船停靠码头的夜晚，木船工人便换上了崭新的衣服，三三两两信步漫游。在涪陵县沿乌江边的码头上，有一排整齐的大瓦房，这是解放后人民政府特意拨给木船工人的宿舍。在距涪陵县城五、六里远的风景幽美的清溪沟，有一块九十多亩的土地，正修建着三幢漂亮的楼房，这也是木船工人的宿舍。工人的生活显著提高了，他们都说这是从“地狱”走上了“天堂”。就拿陈银昌这个年青工人来说，他家的人口很多，经济生活是中等程度。他和他父亲给封建把头邹炳全拉了十多年船，穷得连裤子都穿不上，全家都住在乌江悬岸上的一个石崖洞里，一年有八个月靠着吃野菜和观音土为生。解放后他们分到三间宽敞的大草房和两间小草房，搬出了那个住了十几年的又黑又潮湿的石崖洞。今年他家除了全年的吃粮外，还买了两只猪、五只羊，陈银昌和他父亲每人还缝了三件衣服。这个年青工人还特别告诉我：他已结了婚。这的确是一件喜事。过去许多木船工人在封建把头的剥削压榨下，一辈子过着鳏居生活。现在的情况却不同了，就连四十四岁的蔡玉祥都在准备着结婚。蔡玉祥是一个给封建把头当了十三年“长年”（即是给把头当奴隶，没有工资，也没有自由）的老工人，十三年的奴隶生活，把他折磨得又咳嗽又吐血。快解放那一年，封建把头眼看着蔡玉祥再也不能劳动了，便把他赶出去。解放后涪陵木船工会才把他找回来。现在他的吐血病也医治得有起色了。在我访问他的时候，他穿着里外两层新的衣服，里面是龙头细布的白衬衣，外面套着蓝褂。他告诉我：他活了四十多岁，没有穿过裤子，一年四季就穿件烂长衫，夏天睡在屋檐下，冬天就睡在火堆边，吃的是胡椒搀沙子饭。他高兴地说：“现在住在工人宿舍里，有铺有盖，一天三餐大米饭，五天一个大牙祭，有菜有肉，比以前可真不同啊！”
    在乌江上有许多像蔡玉祥这样的木船工人，他们脱离了苦海，过着幸福的生活。为了生活得更加美好，他们以劳动和智慧与乌江的险滩激流搏斗，使一向被视为“天险”的乌江驯服了。过去在乌江上流传的“三只木轮下涪州，一只到达可保本”的话，现在已不存在了。今年上半年很少有木船失事。在乌江上我还看见了新造出来的“夺龙子船”成群结队地溯江而行。工人告诉我这种船过去只能在长江航行，现在平安地驶进了乌江。过去木船每只只能载十七吨半的盐巴，每年行走两次；现在可以载到二十四吨了，今年一月到六月平均每只船都行驶了四次到六次。有的船并创造了下水载到四十七吨的纪录。由于木船工人劳动热情的高涨，提高了运输效率。今年上半年从沿江各地运出来的土、特产品，比一九五一年全年增加百分之九十七；今年上半年运进去的大宗食盐和各种日用品，比一九五一年上半年增加了百分之六十一点六。这使过低的土、特产品价格停跌并转向上升，乌江流域内农业品与工业品的剪刀差价逐渐缩减，如武隆县木根乡过去五升苞谷换一斤盐巴，现在一升苞谷就可换一斤盐巴，有力地促进了乌江流域的经济繁荣。
