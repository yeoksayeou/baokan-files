    Yang Xianting Agricultural Production Cooperative Members Unanimously Express Desire to Learn from the Soviet Union
    Editor: Yang Xianting, who went to the Soviet Union for a visit on September 16th, has returned. The cooperative members were harvesting in the fields, and upon hearing that Old Yang had returned, they immediately put down their tools and rushed back, surrounding Old Yang like a swarm of bees, asking all sorts of questions. Old Yang told everyone about Soviet industry, agriculture, collective farms, and the happy life of Soviet farmers. Liu Suqin and Wu Wenxue said: "In the past, we heard that the Soviet Union was good, with machines doing the work and people living happily, but we never saw it. This time, our own relative saw it, which is as good as seeing it with our own eyes! Hearing this, we are filled with strength."
    Agricultural group leader Zhou Gui murmured in the fields during the summer: "What's the point of working so hard? What we earn with our hands is spent just as quickly. Will we ever live to see socialism in our old age?" Now, he says: "Let's work hard. We'll lay a good foundation this year and use more horse-drawn farm tools next year. If we build for five years, we'll soon be using machines too." Lü Fengcai said: "I didn't even have a new quilt when I got married. This year, with the establishment of the agricultural production cooperative, I got a new quilt in the first year. I am so happy! And that's not all, the women in my family all have a set of cadre clothes with skirts. What we eat and wear has all changed. And this is just the beginning! Wouldn't it be even better when we establish a collective farm!" When the cooperative members feel tired while working in the fields, someone shouts the slogan "Look ahead!" and everyone thinks of the Soviet Union leading the way for us, and they work with redoubled energy. The slogan "Learn from the Soviet Union" has become the driving force for the cooperative members to move forward.

    杨显亭农业生产合作社社员一致表示要向苏联学习
    编辑同志：九月十六日去苏联参观的杨显亭回来了。社员正在地里收割，听说老杨回来了，马上把刀搁下，跑回来，像一窝蜂子似地把老杨围的风雨不透，问长问短。老杨把苏联的工业、农业、集体农庄、苏联农民幸福生活，一一讲给大家。刘素琴、吴文学说：过去听说苏联好，干活使机器，生活幸福，就是没看见。这回自己的亲人看了一趟，等于我们亲眼看见了！这一听浑身都是力量。
    农业组长老周贵夏天在地里叨咕过：这么干有什么劲头？黑手挣来，白手花了，这么大岁数还能赶上社会主义吗？现在，他说：好好干，今年打下底，明年多使马拉农具，建设它五年，我们也很快使机器啦。吕凤财说：“我结婚也没做上新被子，今年成立农业生产合作社，头一年就盖上了新被子。我真高兴！这还不算，我家妇女都有了一套带裙子的干部服。吃的穿的都变了样。这才刚开头哇！将来要成立集体农庄，不更好了吗！”社员们在地里干活疲劳时，有人一喊出“往前看”的口号，大家就想起了苏联正在前边给我们带路，就精神百倍地干起来了。向苏联学习的口号已成了社员们前进的动力。
