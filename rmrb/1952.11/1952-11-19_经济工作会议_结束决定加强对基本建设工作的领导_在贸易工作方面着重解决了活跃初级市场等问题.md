Xinhua News Agency, 17th. The North China Financial and Economic Work Conference, convened by the North China Administrative Committee of the Central People's Government's Government Administration Council on October 21st, concluded on November 2nd. The conference conducted detailed discussions on the work of industry, trade, and finance in North China, and resolved many important issues in future financial and economic work.

	In terms of industrial production: The conference first reviewed the completion of the third quarter's production increase and conservation plan. Since the launch of the production increase and conservation campaign in various factories and mines, thanks to mobilizing all employees to tap potential, find tricks, and promote advanced experience, they have generally exceeded the national plan, and some factories and mines have even completed the production increase and conservation plan. However, some small factories and mines have not yet completed their tasks. Therefore, the central task for the fourth quarter is to do a good job in verification and strive to complete the task, while also preparing the 1953 plan. In order to welcome the country's large-scale economic construction next year, the conference decided that it is necessary to strengthen leadership in basic construction work in the future: (1) It is necessary to shift the focus of leadership to basic construction in a planned way, and include basic construction in the important work agenda; strengthen the organizational structure of basic construction, and equip and replenish forces.
	(2) In order to strive to complete this year's basic construction tasks, all provinces and cities are required to make overall plans for tasks such as surveying, design, transportation, material preparation, and labor organization in basic construction work, rank them according to the nature of the tasks, distinguish between primary and secondary, and prioritize the urgent ones, so as to strengthen the organization and planning of work. (3) Strengthen design work. In addition to the establishment of design institutions in various provinces and cities, efforts should be made to actively strengthen design forces. (4) In terms of construction, leadership over construction companies should be strengthened first, cadres should be replenished, construction, materials, and transportation management should be strengthened, the number of permanent workers should be increased, and winter training should be carried out.

	In terms of trade work: In addition to reviewing the current situation of the patriotic production increase and conservation campaign, the conference focused on solving the problems of activating the primary market, adjusting industrial product prices, and establishing department store wholesale stations. In order to rationally adjust commodity prices, the conference decided that local economic departments, cooperatives, and private industrial and commercial enterprises should jointly form a price adjustment committee to solve the problem through consultation. Generally, the regional price differences between urban and rural areas should be relaxed, and the wholesale and retail price differences should be appropriately expanded in order to further activate the market. In addition, it was decided to establish department store wholesale stations in eight locations: Beijing, Tianjin, Taiyuan, Zhangjiakou, Guihua, Tangshan, Shijiazhuang, and Handan.

	At the end of the conference, Liu Lantao, Director of the North China Administrative Committee of the Government Administration Council, attended and spoke. He emphasized that the central task in the future is construction, of which economic construction is the center of all construction, and the center of economic construction is industrial construction, especially heavy industrial construction. Liu Lantao talked about the issue of dealing with private industrial and commercial enterprises. He pointed out that the country's large-scale economic construction will begin in the future, and the state-owned economy and the cooperative economy will naturally have great development, which is beneficial to the fundamental interests of the people of the whole country, but legitimate private industrial and commercial enterprises that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood will also have appropriate development. We must give private merchants the possibility of legitimate operation and appropriate development, and at the same time, we must prevent private merchants from speculation and profiteering, and committing the "five poisons" again. Liu Lantao talked about the issue of organizing cooperation and cooperation, and asked everyone to pay attention to it and strengthen leadership. He clearly pointed out that after the completion of land reform and other social reforms, the most important way to protect and cherish the interests of farmers is to organize and lead them to help each other and cooperate, develop production, and complete the glorious task of patriotic production increase.

    华北财政经济工作会议
    结束决定加强对基本建设工作的领导
    在贸易工作方面着重解决了活跃初级市场等问题
    【新华社十七日讯】中央人民政府政务院华北行政委员会十月二十一日召开的华北财政经济工作会议，已于十一月二日结束。会议就华北工业、贸易、财政等方面的工作进行了详细的讨论，解决了今后财经工作中许多重要问题。
    在工业生产方面：会议首先检查了第三季度增产节约计划完成的情况。各厂矿开展增产节约竞赛以来，由于发动了全体职工挖潜力、找窍门、推广先进经验，一般都超过了国家计划，有些厂矿并已完成增产节约计划。但有的小厂矿尚未完成任务，因此第四季度的中心工作是作好查定工作，争取完成任务，同时编制一九五三年计划。为了迎接明年国家大规模的经济建设，会议决定今后必须加强对基本建设工作的领导：（一）要将领导重点有计划地转到基本建设上来，将基本建设列入重要的工作议程；加强基本建设的组织机构，配备与充实力量。
    （二）为了争取完成今年的基本建设任务，要求各省市对基本建设工作中的勘察、设计、运输、器材准备、劳动力组织等任务作通盘筹划，按任务的性质，进行排队，分清主要次要，轻重缓急，以加强工作的组织性和计划性。（三）加强设计工作，除各省市可设立设计机构外，应积极加强设计力量。（四）施工方面，应首先加强对建筑公司的领导，充实干部，加强施工、材料、运输管理工作，增加固定工人，进行冬季整训等工作。
    在贸易工作方面：会议除检查了目前爱国增产节约竞赛运动的情况外，着重解决了活跃初级市场，调整工业品价格和建立百货批发站的问题。为了合理调整商品价格，会议决定由各地经济部门、合作社及私营工商业者共同组成物价调整委员会，协商解决。一般应放宽城乡间的地区差价，适当扩大批发零售差价，以便进一步活跃市场。此外，确定在北京、天津、太原、张家口、归绥、唐山、石家庄、邯郸八处设立百货批发站。
    会议将结束时，政务院华北行政委员会主任刘澜涛到会讲话。他着重指出：今后的中心工作是建设，其中经济建设又是一切建设的中心，而经济建设的中心，又以工业建设，特别是重工业建设为中心。刘澜涛谈到对待私营工商业的问题。他指出今后国家大规模经济建设将要开始，国营经济和合作经济自然会有很大发展，这是对全国人民的根本利益有好处的，但正当的、对国计民生有利的私营工商业，也会有适当的发展。我们要给予私商以正当经营和适当发展的可能，同时也必须防止私商的投机倒把，再施五毒。刘澜涛谈到组织起来合作化的问题，要求大家予以重视并加强领导。他明确指出：在土地改革及其他社会改革完成以后，保护和爱护农民利益最重要的办法，是组织和领导他们互助合作，发展生产，以完成爱国增产的光荣任务。
