More than 150 representatives of male and female youth league members directly under the Central Committee of the Youth League and students of various ethnic groups from the minority class of the Central League School participated in the get-together.

Secretary Li Chang delivered a speech at the banquet, expressing warm welcome on behalf of the Central Committee of the Youth League to the young people of the Tibetan brothers who came all the way from Lhasa to Beijing. He said: The peaceful liberation of Tibet has united the youth of Tibet with the youth of the whole country. Today, everyone can gather together. This is the happiness that Chairman Mao has given to the youth of all ethnic groups. The youth of all ethnic groups should unite more closely and strive to build a great motherland and a new Tibet.

Ou Xie·Tudeng Sangqu, a youth representative of the Tibetan Delegation, said: The Tibetan Delegation came to the capital of the motherland and was honored to be entertained by Chairman Mao. Today, we are again entertained by the Central Committee of the Youth League, which makes us deeply feel the warmth of the big family of the motherland. When we return to Tibet in the future, we are determined to repay Chairman Mao's kindness with hard study and hard work. Men Dui·Luosang Wangdui said: We, the youth representatives of Tibet, are infinitely excited and happy under the enthusiastic encouragement of the fraternal youth in the capital of the motherland. The youth of Lhasa have established the Lhasa Patriotic Youth Cultural Federation. We hope that the Central Committee of the Youth League can send people to Lhasa to lead and help us do our work well. At this time, the banquet was jubilant, and toasts were raised to the health of Chairman Mao, the great leader of the people of all ethnic groups, to the health of the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Lama, and to the great unity of the youth of all ethnic groups in the motherland. The female youth representatives of the Central Committee of the Youth League also toasted Yao Xi·Zeren Zhuoma, the Dalai Lama's sister, who was present. Finally, the Central Committee of the New Democratic Youth League of China presented the Lhasa Patriotic Youth Cultural Federation with youth activity photos, waist drums, harmonicas, accordions, trumpets and other gifts. Yao Xi·Zeren Zhuoma thanked the Central Committee of the Youth League on behalf of the youth representatives of the Tibetan Delegation.
