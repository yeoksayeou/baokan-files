Correct Thinking, Strengthen Institutions, and Do a Good Job in Next Year's Capital Construction
Weng Dimin, Chief of the Capital Construction Department, East China Financial and Economic Committee

The capital construction work in East China over the past three years has grown from small to large, from decentralized to centralized, from no experience to exploration and learning, and from exploration and learning to gradual improvement.

In the total investment in capital construction in the East China region over the past three years, the total investment in East China's first-level capital construction, excluding the investment in the Huai River project in 1950, has increased year by year. The investment in 1952 was 2.24 times that of 1950. Among them, the first-level industrial investment in the Greater Administrative Area in 1951 was 1.51 times that of 1950, and in 1952 was 8.29 times that of 1950, and 5.59 times that of 1951. This speed is extraordinary, and as a result, old enterprises have undergone significant transformations, production capacity has greatly increased, and the leadership of state-owned enterprises has grown day by day. The facts once again prove that our country's strength is growing, our construction cause is steadily advancing, and our capital construction work is gradually improving and becoming standardized. This is due to the correct leadership of the Party and the efforts of all comrades engaged in capital construction work.

However, we still have serious biases and shortcomings in our thinking, organization, and practical actions, which have caused huge losses in our work. This serious phenomenon must be brought to our attention and corrected in time to meet the large-scale economic construction.

The current problems in the capital construction work in East China can be summarized as follows:

First and foremost is the issue of thinking. Based on the experience of the past three years, the main contradiction in capital construction thinking is the contradiction between centralization, planning, and decentralization, and blindness. In the past three years, leaders at all levels, including the East China Financial and Economic Committee, have not sufficiently recognized or estimated the importance, comprehensiveness, and arduousness of capital construction work, and therefore ideological leadership has also been insufficient. This is the fundamental reason for the biases that have occurred in capital construction work. This situation still exists to a considerable extent.

Some of our leaders and comrades responsible for capital construction work still lack experience in large-scale capital construction and still have varying degrees of rural and supply-system viewpoints and styles. They often do not proceed from the overall situation or from reality, and do not estimate the possibility of subjective forces (human, financial, material, and technical capabilities) and objective conditions. They do not conduct serious investigations and research in all aspects, and do not consider the direction of development from the balance of supply, production, and sales. They lack a comprehensive plan for the future development, treating the head when it hurts and the foot when it aches, "building temples because there are many Bodhisattvas, and adding Bodhisattvas because the temples are large." They do not consider economic accounting, "reaching out for money," "being generous when it is available," and "not calculating costs," emphasizing special circumstances and not distinguishing between priorities and urgency. Their factory construction standards are either "the best in the country" or "the best inside the customs," and the best machines are foreign-made, and must be large-scale precision machines, without estimating whether they are commensurate with their existing capabilities. Being fond of greatness and success, having a partial view, and departmentalism are no longer isolated phenomena. Past facts have proven that the units responsible for construction invariably put forward huge plans, and some personnel in the higher-level organs often do not seriously review them, passing them up level by level without launching a serious ideological struggle and ideological education.

Many of our leaders and comrades responsible for capital construction work have not yet put capital construction on an important agenda. Some people have never even considered this issue and are clueless about the current situation and development direction of their subordinate units. They regard capital construction as a chore for a few technicians, blindly trusting some old technicians who are full of bourgeois ideas, and do not pay attention to the opinions of the masses, mystifying technology. They emphasize that they do not understand capital construction business, and rest assured that it will be left to its own devices. Therefore, they do not personally grasp and review the plans and designs, which is actually abandoning the leadership of capital construction. As a result, capital construction, which concerns the century-old plan and the state's trillions of yuan of investment, is often handled only by a few cadres or technicians. It should be recognized that this is very risky.

Some of our leaders and comrades responsible for capital construction work take capital construction too simply, thinking that capital construction is just a matter of "building houses and buying some machines," and that "as long as there is money, everything else is not a problem." This harmful guiding ideology manifests itself in an eagerness for quick results, unrealistic impatience, and treating planning and design work with an extremely unserious attitude. They adopt an opposing attitude to the provisions of the "Provisional Measures for Capital Construction Work" promulgated by the Central Government, and compile plans only to ask for money (the annual plan of one factory was compiled in only half an hour). Once the money is in hand, they hope to get things done immediately. They do not pay attention to investigation and research before design, design hastily, rush to construction, or design while constructing, or even construct without design. As a result, work is stopped waiting for materials, work is stopped waiting for drawings, quality is reduced, and rework is wasted. This has become a common phenomenon.

All these biases in leadership thinking manifest themselves in various forms of blindness, and the result of the development of various forms of blindness is to cause serious losses to the state in capital construction.

Secondly, there is the issue of organization. Capital construction is a very detailed and heavy task. From deciding what to do (planning) and how to do it (design) to specific implementation (construction), it includes a series of organizational tasks. In particular, correct investigation, correct planning, correct design, and correct construction, these four links are indispensable. To ensure the correct implementation of these four tasks, there must be sound organizational institutions and a certain number and quality of cadres. However, the current situation is just the opposite. When proposing capital construction projects, they are greedy for greatness and greed for more, but when actually carrying out capital construction work, there is a common phenomenon of incomplete institutions and no one in charge. Looking at the departments in charge of capital construction planning in the financial and economic committees at all levels, the institutions are not sound, and they cannot grasp the balance and layout of capital construction in their respective regions. They have not put forward directions and relevant policy instructions for a certain period of work to provide business departments with attention and compliance. This is one of the fundamental reasons for promoting the blindness of grassroots construction units. The capital construction institutions of various competent departments are also mostly incomplete, and the task is too different. Last year, the East China Industrial Department invested several hundred billion yuan, and only three people were doing actual work. Although a capital construction office has been established, its strength is still far from the objective requirements in terms of the tasks it undertakes. The strength of other departments is even weaker (one department was once in charge of capital construction by an accountant). The situation of grassroots construction units is even more serious. The person in charge is busy leading production and believes that capital construction is an extra burden, temporarily gathering a few people to support it. Many units have capital construction investments that exceed several times the original fixed assets, but no one is in charge and there is no special institution to preside over it. The mixing of capital construction and production, and the mutual flow of funds, is also a common phenomenon. The Party, trade union, and Youth League of many units do not care about capital construction, and even do not know about it at all.

The phenomenon of no one being responsible in construction is even more serious. Many comrades regard construction as a matter for construction companies, and think that everything will be fine after contracting out the project. However, the organization of the construction company itself is very weak. There is no organizational leadership on the construction site, no political work, no construction plan and operating norms, and a lack of strict inspection. Therefore, the quality of the project is low, materials are wasted, and the phenomenon of stopping work and idling is frequent. The old feudal contract exploitation system on the construction site has not been eliminated, the enthusiasm and creativity of workers cannot be brought into play, and labor efficiency cannot be improved. Accidents and losses caused by sloppy construction are also extremely serious.

Thirdly, there is the issue of method. To do a good job in capital construction, not only must there be correct ideological leadership and sound organizational institutions, but also a complete and scientific set of methods. East China has not done enough in this regard. The "Provisional Measures for Capital Construction Work" promulgated by the Financial and Economic Committee of the Central Government in January this year were formulated in response to the actual problems found in capital construction in the past, combined with the advanced experience of the Soviet Union. It clearly stipulates the principles, disciplines, and procedures for carrying out capital construction in the future. The implementation of these measures can ensure that we do not repeat the mistakes of the past. However, first of all, we have not made good use of this weapon to fight against various erroneous tendencies. Secondly, we have not formulated some regulations and systems suitable for the actual situation in East China based on the "Provisional Measures for Capital Construction Work" to pave the way for capital construction, which has also increased the difficulties in practical work.

Due to the existence of the above problems, the consequences are very serious. It is estimated that the capital construction plan for 1952 cannot be fully completed. In the actual work, there are very serious biases, resulting in huge losses to the state's assets. The failure to complete this year's plan will directly affect next year's work deployment. Next year's capital construction task is arduous and heavy. According to preliminary investigations, the materials submitted by various ministries and provinces will be 320% of this year's, and according to the central government's control figures, it will be more than doubled. In addition, the figures originally included in the cross-year and those that cannot be completed this year will be even greater. Therefore, how to organize the forces in all aspects and strive to basically complete or mostly complete this year's tasks will be the most realistic and serious task at present.

What to do in the future?

First of all, we must correct our understanding of capital construction, strengthen the ideological leadership of capital construction, carry out extensive publicity and education inside and outside the Party, and launch a struggle between the two lines on the capital construction front. Establish the centralization and planning of capital construction, and overcome decentralization and blindness. Resolutely correct the ideas of some leading cadres who only pay attention to production and not capital construction, and who oppose capital construction to production.

Secondly, we must strengthen the organization of capital construction, and we should do the following:

1. Strengthen capital construction planning. Financial and economic committees at all levels must establish capital construction planning offices, equip them with capable cadres, and uniformly grasp the capital construction plans of their respective regions. The requirements for this group of cadres should not only have a considerable level of education, but also have a certain level of policy, be able to discover problems, and be able to analyze and study them.

2. Strengthen design work. Existing technical personnel must be used in a concentrated manner. Business departments with more capital construction can immediately start to establish enterprise-oriented design companies, concentrate their efforts, carry out design work step by step and with focus, and at the same time start to initially formulate design standards and various specifications to save manpower and material resources.

3. Strengthen the capital construction institutions of competent departments and capital construction units. Various competent departments can establish capital construction departments or sections/groups according to actual needs. The main task of this institution should be to organize forces to promote the institutions that supervise and inspect the specific implementation of the plan in all aspects.

4. Strengthen the work of the construction departments, first of all, strengthen the leadership of the construction companies. Construction and installation projects generally account for more than 50% of the capital construction workload. Therefore, under the leadership of the East China Construction Engineering Department, various localities should strengthen the strength of construction and installation projects to meet the needs of capital construction tasks. It is necessary to transfer capable political cadres and technical cadres to strengthen the institutions, boldly promote outstanding elements among the workers, improve the contract system, strengthen the organization and management of construction sites, and formulate a set of construction site management methods and political work methods in a short period of time.

5. Strengthen the unified leadership of the Party, administration, trade union, and Youth League. In construction units, capital construction should be regarded as the primary task of the Party, administration, trade union, and Youth League at present. A certain reporting system and inspection system should be established, and the capital construction statistical monthly report system stipulated by the Financial and Economic Committee of the Central Government should be conscientiously implemented in order to take the initiative to grasp it. Establish a mass viewpoint in capital construction work, give play to the creativity and enthusiasm of the working class, and ensure the victorious completion of capital construction tasks.

Finally, from leading cadres to staff members, they must all, without exception, study the business related to capital construction. We cannot always stay at the stage of not understanding the business and having no experience. We must conscientiously study the documents related to capital construction, especially the "Provisional Measures for Capital Construction Work," understand its spirit and essence, and master a series of links in capital construction work, learn to lead capital construction, learn to compile, review, and comprehensively capital construction plans, learn to do a good job in design work, and learn to do a good job in organizing and leading construction. In the learning and practical exploration, everyone should use their brains, formulate various feasible methods, so that our work is in order and gradually improved. Everyone should take action to pave the way for future capital construction work.

    端正思想，加强机构，做好明年的基本建设工作
    华东财政经济委员会基本建设处处长  翁迪民
    三年来华东基本建设工作是从小到大，从分散到集中，从毫无经验到摸索学习，从摸索学习到逐步提高。
    三年来华东全区基本建设的总投资中，华东一级基本建设的投资总额如除去一九五○年投资治淮工程一项，都是逐年增加的：一九五二年的投资为一九五○年的二·二四倍，其中大区一级工业投资一九五一年为一九五○年的一·五一倍，一九五二年为一九五○年的八·二九倍，为一九五一年的五·五九倍。这一速度是不平常的，因此使旧的企业获得了显著的改造，生产能力大大提高，国营企业的领导力量日益增长。事实再一次证明了我们国家的力量日益强大，我们的建设事业正稳步前进，我们的基本建设工作正逐步提高，走向正规。这是由于党的正确领导和全体从事基本建设工作同志们的努力。
    但我们从思想上、组织上到实际行动上都还存在着严重的偏向和缺陷，曾使工作招致巨大的损失，这一严重的现象必须引起警惕，及时予以纠正，以便迎接大规模的经济建设。
    目前华东基本建设工作上存在着的问题，归纳起来有下列几点：
    首先是思想问题。根据三年来的经验，基本建设思想中的主要矛盾是集中性、计划性与分散性、盲目性的矛盾。过去三年来各级领导包括华东财政经济委员会在内，对于基本建设工作的重要性、全面性和艰巨性是认识不够、估计不足的，因此思想领导也不够。这是在基本建设工作中发生偏向的基本原因。这种情况在目前还相当严重地存在着。
    我们有些领导和负责基本建设工作的同志，还缺乏大规模基本建设的经验，还有着不同程度的农村的和供给制的观点和作风。他们往往不从全面出发，不从实际出发，不估计主观力量（人力、财力、物力和技术能力）与客观条件的可能性；不认真进行各方面的调查研究，从供产销的平衡来考虑发展的方向；对于发展的前途缺乏全面的规划，头痛医头，脚痛医脚，想到那里做到那里，“菩萨多了造庙，庙大了添菩萨”。他们不考虑到经济核算，“伸手要钱”、“宽打窄用”、“不计工本”，强调特殊，不分轻重缓急。他们建厂标准不是“全国第一”的便是“关内第一”的，机器最好是国外货，并且非大型精密机器不可，而不估计与自己的现有力量是否相称。好大喜功，局部观点，本位主义，已不是个别现象。过去的事实证明，负责建设的单位，无例外地提出庞大的计划，而上级机关的若干人员也往往不认真负责审核，层层上转，没有展开严肃的思想斗争和思想教育。
    我们许多领导和负责基本建设工作的同志，至今还没把基本建设放在重要的议事日程上，有些人甚至从未考虑这个问题，对于所属单位的目前情况和发展方向心中无数。他们把基本建设当作少数技术人员的差事，对于未经改造的充满资产阶级思想观点的某些旧技术人员采取盲目信任的态度，对于群众的意见不加重视，把技术神秘化。他们强调不懂基本建设业务，而心安理得地任其自流。因此，也就不亲自掌握、审查计划和设计，这实际上是放弃了对基本建设的领导。因此，攸关百年大计的基本建设，国家千百亿元的投资，往往只凭少数干部或技术人员在那里办理。应当认识：这是十分冒险的。
    我们有些领导和负责基本建设工作的同志把基本建设看得太简单，认为基本建设只不过是“盖盖房子，买点机器”的事，“只要有钱，别的都不成问题了”。这种有害的指导思想，表现为急于求成，不切实际的急躁情绪，和以极不严肃的态度对待计划设计工作。他们对中央颁布的“基本建设工作暂行办法”的规定采取对立的态度，编造计划只是为了要钱（有一个工厂的年度计划仅以半小时的时间编成），钱到手就希望马上把事情搞好。他们不重视设计前的调查研究，草率设计，急忙施工，或者一面设计，一面施工，甚至没有设计就施工。结果是停工待料，停工待图，质量降低，返工浪费。这已成为一般的现象。
    所有这些领导思想上的偏向，表现为各式各样的盲目性，而各式各样盲目性的发展结果，就造成国家在基本建设上的严重损失。
    其次是组织问题。基本建设是十分细致繁重的工作，从决定做什么（计划）与怎么做（设计）到具体执行（施工），包括一系列的组织工作。特别是正确调查、正确计划、正确设计、正确施工，这四个环节缺一不可。保证这四项工作的正确进行，必须有健全的组织机构和一定数量与质量的干部。可是目前的情况与此恰恰相反，提出基本建设项目时好大贪多，实际进行基本建设工作时，却普遍存在机构不全，无人负责的现象。从各级财政经济委员会主管基本建设计划的部门来看，机构都不健全，不能掌握所属地区基本建设的平衡和布局；对于一定时期的工作没有提出方向和有关政策性的指示，以提供业务部门注意遵循。这是助长基层建设单位的盲目性的基本原因之一。各主管部门的基本建设机构，也大多残缺不全，与任务悬殊太大。华东工业部去年数千亿元的投资，只有三个人做实际工作；目前虽成立了基本建设处，但以所担当的任务来衡量，其力量还是距离客观的要求很远。其他各部力量更弱（某部曾由一个会计主管基本建设）。基层建设单位情况更为严重，负责人忙于领导生产，认为基本建设是额外负担，临时凑几个人顶一顶。许多单位基本建设投资超过原来的固定资产几倍，却没有专人负责，没有专门的机构来主持。基本建设与生产混在一起，资金相互流通，也是普遍现象。许多单位的党、工会、青年团不过问基本建设，甚至根本不知道这回事。
    施工中的无人负责现象更为严重。许多同志都把施工当作建筑公司的事情，把工程包出去后便万事大吉；而建筑公司本身的组织又很薄弱，工地没有组织领导，没有政治工作，没有施工计划和操作规范，缺乏严格的检查，因此工程质量低，材料浪费，停工窝工现象经常发生。工地旧的封建式包工剥削制尚未肃清，工人积极性创造性得不到发挥，劳动效率得不到提高。由于施工草率而造成的事故和损失，也极为严重。
    第三是方法问题。要做好基本建设工作，不但要有正确的思想领导和健全的组织机构，还要有一整套完整的和科学的办法。这一点，我们华东做得非常不够。中央政务院财政经济委员会今年一月颁布的“基本建设工作暂行办法”，是针对过去基本建设中发现的实际问题，结合苏联先进经验而制定的。它明确规定了今后进行基本建设的方针原则、纪律和程序。这个办法的贯彻执行，可以保证我们不再重复过去的错误。但首先，我们没有很好地运用这个武器去和各种错误倾向进行斗争。其次，我们没有根据“基本建设工作暂行办法”拟订一些适合于华东实际情况的章则制度，为基本建设铺平道路，这也增加了实际工作中的困难。
    由于以上问题的存在，其后果是十分严重的，一九五二年度的基本建设计划估计已不能全部完成；在实际进行工作中又存在着十分严重的偏向，以致造成国家资财的巨大损失。今年的计划不能完成，将直接影响明年的工作部署。明年基本建设的任务是艰巨繁重的，据初步调查，按各部各省提出的材料将为今年的百分之三百二十，按中央控制数字亦将达一倍以上，加上原列入跨年度的和今年不能完成跨至明年的数字将更大。因此，如何组织各方面的力量，争取今年任务的基本完成或大部完成，将是当前最现实的严重任务。
    今后怎样办？
    首先，必须端正对于基本建设的认识，加强基本建设的思想领导，在党内外进行广泛的宣传教育，展开基本建设战线上两条路线的斗争。树立基本建设的集中性、计划性，克服分散性、盲目性。切实纠正某些领导干部中只重视生产不重视基本建设以及把基本建设与生产对立起来的思想。
    其次，必须加强基本建设的组织，应该做到：
    一、加强基本建设计划工作。各级财政经济委员会必须成立基本建设计划处，配备得力的干部，统一掌握各该地区的基本建设计划。对这一部分干部的要求，不但要有相当的文化程度，而且要具备一定的政策水平，能够发现问题，并能加以分析研究。
    二、加强设计工作。现有技术人员必须集中使用，基本建设较多的业务部门，可即着手成立企业化的设计公司，集中力量，分别缓急，有步骤有重点地进行设计工作，同时着手初步拟订设计标准和各项规格，节省人力物力。
    三、加强主管部门和基本建设单位的基本建设机构。各主管部门可按实际需要分别成立基本建设处或科、组。这一机构的主要任务，应当是组织力量推动各方面督促检查具体执行计划的机构。
    四、加强施工部门的工作，首先是加强建筑公司的领导。建筑安装工程，一般的占基本建设工作量百分之五十以上，因此，在华东建筑工程部的领导下，各地应加强建筑安装工程的力量，适应基本建设任务的需要，要抽调得力的政治干部和技术干部充实机构，大胆提拔工人中的优秀分子，健全包工合同制度，加强工地的组织和管理，在短期内定出一套工地管理办法和政治工作办法来。
    五、加强党、行政、工会、青年团的统一领导，在建设单位，应当将基本建设作为党、行政、工会、青年团当前首要任务，应当建立一定的报告制度与检查制度，将中央财政经济委员会规定的基本建设统计月报制度认真加以贯彻，以便主动掌握。树立基本建设工作中的群众观点，发挥工人阶级的创造性和积极性，保证基本建设任务的胜利完成。
    最后，从领导干部到工作人员必须无例外地学习有关基本建设的业务。我们不能永远停留在不懂业务、没有经验的阶段。必须认真学习有关基本建设的文件，特别是“基本建设工作暂行办法”，领会其精神和实质，要把基本建设工作上一系列的关节弄通，学会领导基本建设，学会编制、审查、综合基本建设计划，学会做好设计工作，学会做好组织、领导施工。在学习与实际工作的摸索中，大家开动脑筋，拟订各种可行的办法，使我们的工作有条不紊，逐步提高。大家动手，为今后的基本建设工作铺平道路。
