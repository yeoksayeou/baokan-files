Xinhua News Agency, November 14th: The Tibetan Tribute Delegation and the National Day Observation Delegations from various regions and ethnic groups gathered in the capital this year for the great National Day, once again demonstrating the increasing consolidation and strengthening of the friendly unity of all ethnic groups in the People's Republic of China.

The representatives and staff of the Tibetan Tribute Delegation and the National Day Observation Delegations from various regions and ethnic groups totaled more than 300 people, including various strata of 47 ethnic groups. Among them, the Buyi, Gelao, Sa, Tu, A'chang, and Mili ethnic groups from the Southwest region; the Kyrgyz and Hezhe ethnic groups from the Northeast region; the Vietnamese, Maonan, and Jewish ethnic groups from the Central South region; and the She and Dan ethnic groups from the East China region were all represented for the first time at the National Day celebrations in Beijing. The representatives of the Tibetan Tribute Delegation also crossed oceans and traveled thousands of miles from the remote southwestern border of the motherland to Beijing to express the respect of the Dalai Lama, the Panchen Lama, and the Tibetan people to Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government.

After arriving in Beijing, the Tibetan Tribute Delegation and the National Day Observation Delegations from various regions and ethnic groups attended the grand celebration banquet held by Chairman Mao on the eve of National Day and participated in the solemn and great National Day celebration ceremony. They presented flags and paid tribute to Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu De, and Premier Zhou Enlai. They also attended receptions hosted by Commander-in-Chief Zhu De, Premier Zhou Enlai, and the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and listened to reports from Li Weihan, Chairman of the Nationalities Affairs Commission of the Central People's Government, and Vice Chairmen Ulanhu and Liu Geping. They were invited to send representatives to attend the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference, visited various exhibitions and construction projects such as factories and schools, and toured the capital's scenic spots and historical sites.

The representatives were extremely excited and happy to see Chairman Mao in Beijing and to see that Chairman Mao was so healthy. Representatives of all ethnic groups gratefully said, "Seeing Chairman Mao has fulfilled a lifelong wish." "Seeing Chairman Mao is not only an honor for me, but also an honor for my ethnic group." "We are so happy that Chairman Mao is so healthy." The representatives' visit to Beijing gave them a deeper understanding of the greatness of the motherland and the strength of the world's peace and democracy camp. They are full of hope and confidence for the bright future of the motherland and their own ethnic groups.

In order to understand the opinions and demands of the people of all ethnic groups, the Central People's Government, through the Nationalities Affairs Commission, conducted extensive interviews and talks with representatives of various regions and ethnic groups, and the representatives of all ethnic groups freely expressed their opinions.

When talking about the living conditions of their own ethnic groups since liberation, the representatives always first expressed their gratitude for the meticulous care and assistance of Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government. It can be seen from the representatives' opinions that, in the past three years, thanks to the implementation of Chairman Mao's ethnic policy by governments at all levels, the original backwardness of minority areas has been changing, and ethnic relations have undergone significant fundamental changes. Through various movements, especially the establishment of ethnic regional autonomous governments and ethnic democratic united governments, ethnic unity has been greatly strengthened, and the various tasks in the local areas have been promoted. After the organization of mutual aid production groups including different ethnic components in some earlier liberated areas, the friendship between these ethnic groups has become more deeply rooted in daily life. After the promulgation of the "Outline for the Implementation of Ethnic Regional Autonomy in the People's Republic of China" and other four documents, all ethnic groups have a deeper understanding of the ethnic policy of the Central People's Government, and the more active and heightened ethnic feelings have motivated the people of all ethnic groups to more actively work and more urgently request the assistance of the People's Government in order to strive for the development and progress of their own ethnic groups in political, economic, and cultural aspects. The representatives unanimously expressed their heartfelt support for the promulgation of the "Outline for the Implementation of Ethnic Regional Autonomy in the People's Republic of China" and other four documents. They also inspected the ethnic work in their respective regions based on these four documents and put forward many good opinions.

The representatives of all ethnic groups expressed their gratitude to the people's governments at all levels who correctly implemented the ethnic policy and to the hard-working government staff.

The representatives of all ethnic groups poured out their opinions and reflected the current demands of their own people to the Central People's Government, which they wholeheartedly loved and trusted. The State Council of the Central People's Government instructed the Nationalities Affairs Commission of the Central Committee to study these opinions and demands together with the relevant competent departments. Those that should be handled or answered by the Central Government will be directly handled or answered. Those that should be handled or answered by the local people's governments will be handled by the local people's governments through the Nationalities Affairs Commission of the Central Committee or the relevant competent departments.

During their stay in Beijing, the representatives were warmly and enthusiastically received by the Central People's Government. The central and capital's organs, organizations, and citizens also welcomed and received them like brothers. The representatives of all ethnic groups also lived together harmoniously, and the living habits and religious beliefs of all ethnic groups were respected, which made them feel the warmth and loveliness of the motherland's big family.

Now, the representatives of all ethnic groups have left Beijing one after another. The representatives of various ethnic groups from the Central South, East China, North China, Northeast, Inner Mongolia, and Northwest and Southwest regions have gone to Tianjin, Nanjing, Shanghai, Hangzhou, and other places to visit. The representatives of the Tibetan Tribute Delegation and the National Day Observation Delegation of the Tibetan People in the Qamdo area have also gone to the Northeast, Inner Mongolia, and other regions to visit. They will always remember the lovely Beijing, and Beijing will always encourage them to move forward.
