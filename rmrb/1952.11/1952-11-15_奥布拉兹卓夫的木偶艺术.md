    Obraztsov's Puppet Art
    Wang Chaowen

    Sergei Obraztsov, artistic director of the Soviet Puppet Theater, People's Artist of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, and Stalin Prize laureate, enthusiastically shared his work experience and artistic insights with us and performed some puppet shows. These conversations were insightful, and these performances were brilliant.

    Each of the puppet shows he performed lasted only three or four minutes, or one or two minutes. They were all hand puppets, not marionettes. However, the quality of art is mainly determined not by the length of the performance time, nor by the size of the stage or the style of puppet production, but by Obraztsov's political and artistic cultivation. The high degree of ideological and artistic merit demonstrated in these programs allows us to imagine the outstanding achievements of the Soviet Central Puppet Theater, which has complete equipment and many artists.

    "Pouring Wine" mocks the ugliness of a drunkard. It does not focus on imitating the state of drunkenness (it is not enough to merely show the comical aspect of drunkenness), but focuses on revealing the drunkard's decadent qualities: stupidity, laziness, and dishonesty. For this character, everything is about drinking. He "should" drink in the happiness of love, and he "should" drink in the misfortune of unrequited love, just as Obraztsov said in his opening remarks: "...drinking has nothing to do with his happiness or misfortune, it's just a drunkard (something to that effect)..." This drunkard is very real. He carefully examines the wine bottle, smells the aroma of the wine, clinks glasses with the bottle when he is pleased, and bumps heads with the bottle when he is excited. His twisted face when he is dead drunk (exiting) is very funny. He sometimes sings wildly, sometimes looks around; the audience feels that this drunkard, who knows he shouldn't drink but cannot control himself, is portrayed with both satisfaction and unease, depicted in a refined and profound way.

    The performance method of "Pouring Wine" involves the actor's glove being inside the puppet's body, with the other hand replacing the drunkard's hand, performing actions such as holding the wine bottle and wine glass. The cartoonish face of the drunkard, in coordination with the actor's hand, has a power to attract the audience, although the achievement of puppet art mainly does not rely on this interesting combination of a small head and large hands. A similar program to this performance method is "Come Back! I Forgive You." The acting is also exaggerated. The female singer's body rests on the actor's head, and her hands are replaced by the actor's hands. Like "Pouring Wine," this program mocks bad habits and bad styles that should be abandoned.

    Artist Obraztsov concentrates on grasping certain bad performing habits of singers or actors who try to please the audience, portraying those performance movements that do not come from the heart, mocking their exaggerated, pretentious, vulgar flaunting of "skills," and bad style. In his refined, witty, and subtle opening remarks, Obraztsov meaningfully touches on the theme, saying: "I will not introduce the content of the lyrics she sings, because I don't understand them." This is not to say that artist Obraztsov himself really doesn't understand the content of the lyrics, but rather to imply that the content of the lyrics is meaningless, or to allude to singers who don't truly understand the content of the lyrics. If even the audience who are not singers can understand after laughing that they shouldn't treat their work this way, then the principle of how one should treat one's work can also be imagined. If, through the ugliness of this ridiculous singer, the bad habits and bad styles of artists and non-artists who don't work well have been exposed, then the role of this kind of puppet show goes beyond making people laugh, and beyond merely mocking such a singer.

    An artist who seriously studies the appearance, psychology, character, and qualities of various types of people also profoundly understands the special movements, postures, and expressions of animals such as monkeys, cats, and tigers. The subjects used are interesting animals, but in essence, they satirize certain types of people. For example, "Moment," starring male and female monkeys, and "I Want to Stay With You for a While," starring male and female cats, both combine the characteristics of humans and animals. They are very much like real cats and monkeys, and they also seem like people in love, exposing the nature of hypocrisy, exaggeration, and cowardice. The rude and frenzied movements of the male cat, eager to achieve his goal, are both human and feline. All these cats and monkeys, the excitement, seduction, resistance, tenderness, and sadness they display in some small entanglements...are human and also animal. These vivid images, created using refined and meticulous techniques, have skillfully combined certain characteristics of humans and animals. These plots, fabricated on a rational basis, and these exaggerated images with metaphorical qualities, fully demonstrate the artist's high degree of imagination. Before such images, the audience, in addition to feeling interesting and funny, also feels the artist's serious observation, research, and understanding of the subject of description.

    Not all of these puppet shows are for the purpose of satire, some are lyrical. For example, "Lullaby" depicts the little troubles a child gives to his loving mother before falling asleep. These plots are very humorous and funny, but they make people feel close. The actor stands in front of the audience without concealment, representing the mother, with the puppet representing the child on his right hand; due to the realism of the acting, even though he himself is not wearing makeup, people feel that he is a loving mother. Especially the puppet he manipulates, those various movements of touching the mother's lips, joking with the mother, sucking the mother's fingers, and kissing the mother wildly, are very exaggerated and also very real. The overall effect is to enhance the audience's love between mother and child.

    In "Lullaby," like the drunkard and the female singer, the actor's hand is not completely concealed in the acting (the back of the actor's hand is even exposed from inside the puppet's clothes, used as the child's back to pat). According to Obraztsov's own introduction, this semi-realistic performance method is only suitable for small programs; this method, like slightly processing natural tree roots to create various Chinese artworks (such as "Buddha's Hand," "Lingzhi"...), does not conceal the characteristics of natural objects, but also has the characteristics of the things to be created, and is therefore more interesting and attractive under certain circumstances. The key is whether the actor has created something in the main aspects. If the child is not played realistically, if the movements of the drunkard's and female singer's hands do not have a sense of reality, this method is meaningless. A program that reveals the actor's hand even more than the above programs is "The Soul of the Puppet." Only a sphere is placed on the index finger, and the other fingers sometimes represent the puppet's arms, sometimes the puppet's fingers. Because these fingers are very realistic in imitating actions and moods such as embracing, pondering, and self-importance, the audience does not misunderstand that the artist is cutting corners; on the contrary, they thank the artist for creating interesting images.

    Obraztsov, who is good at grasping the audience's demands, is also creative and attractive in the use of language. Although his puppet shows do not violate the laws of puppet shows—relying on action and simplifying language—his language is intelligent, humorous, refined, profound, in a word: very attractive and motivating. For example, before the performance of the program satirizing hypocritical men, he said: "When a man pursues a woman, he says: I can't live without you; when the woman rejects his love, he says: It doesn't matter, it's not the first time I've been rejected. I don't think there are any such men among you." This interesting and meaningful language is also often expressed in his speech. When he introduced why he chose puppet shows as a lifelong career, he spoke of the importance of mothers choosing toys for their children, saying: "Those of you who are already mothers or are preparing to be mothers, or those who are not preparing to be mothers but cannot help but be mothers, must pay attention to choosing gifts for your children."

    Causing the audience to laugh is a characteristic of these puppet shows. And these laughs are all uplifting and healthy. Obraztsov believes that not any ridiculous subject can be used as the subject of a puppet show. In order not to hurt the audience's (especially children's) hearts, one must carefully select the subject. We can only mock the stupidity, laziness, and hypocrisy left over from the old society that hinder the normal development of society, and we cannot mock pain, disease, or encourage children to tease people. This artist, who once created programs mocking the fascist leaders Hitler and Mussolini, has a very flexible and principled grasp of "laughter."

    Regarding the understanding of this special art form of puppet shows, the special requirements of puppet shows of special styles in terms of subject matter, the creation of typical experiences and methods in order to produce universal educational effects, how to distinguish the reasonable needs of young children audiences from adult audiences, the important significance of valuable folk and national art, and how the scenery of musicals can harmonize with stylized dance postures, etc., this loyal friend of the Chinese people who loves Chinese art, this artist with decades of puppet show work experience, expressed many valuable opinions; these opinions will play a significant role in the growth and strengthening of Chinese puppet shows (and other arts).

    奥布拉兹卓夫的木偶艺术
    王朝闻
    苏联木偶戏剧院艺术指导、俄罗斯苏维埃联邦社会主义共和国人民演员、斯大林奖金获得者奥布拉兹卓夫，非常热情地和我们谈他的工作经验和艺术见解，给我们演出过一些木偶节目。这些谈话是很精辟的，这些演出是很精采的。
    他所演出的木偶戏节目，每一个只占三四分钟或一二分钟。都是手上木偶没有提线木偶。可是，艺术的高低主要不决定于演出时间的长短，也不决定于场面大小和木偶的制作样式，而决定于奥布拉兹卓夫的政治素养与艺术素养。这些节目所表现出来的高度的思想性和艺术性，可以使我们想像到具有完善设备和艺术家众多的苏联中央木偶剧院的卓越成就。
    “斟酒”，是嘲笑一个醉鬼的丑态的。它不是在醉态的摹拟上下工夫（仅仅表演出醉态的滑稽是很不够的），而是着重揭发醉鬼那种堕落的品质：愚蠢、懒惰而且不老实。一切为了喝酒的这一个角色，在恋爱的幸福中“应该”喝，在失恋的不幸中也“应该”喝，正如奥布拉兹卓夫的开场白所说：“……喝酒与他的幸与不幸无关，不过是一个醉鬼（大意如此）……”这一个醉鬼，是很真实的。他细看酒瓶，嗅酒的气味，得意时和酒瓶碰杯，激动时和酒瓶碰头，泥醉（退场）时的歪脸，都很可笑。他有时狂歌，有时东张西望；使观众感到：这
    一个明知不该喝酒而又不能控制自己的醉鬼的得意和不安，描写得很洗练也很深刻。
    “斟酒”的表演方式，是演员的一只手套在木偶身里，另一只手代替醉鬼的手，担任了拿酒瓶拿酒杯等等动作。漫画化的醉鬼的脸型，和演员的手相配合，具有一种吸引观众的力量，虽然木偶艺术的成就主要不是依靠这种小头大手的有趣的配合。和这种表演方式相类似的节目，是“你回来吧！我饶恕你”。在演技上也是夸张的。女歌唱者的身子顶在演员头上，她的双手是演员的双手来代替的。这一节目和“斟酒”一样，嘲笑的是应该摒弃的坏习惯坏作风。
    艺术家奥布拉兹卓夫集中地抓住了某种讨好观众的歌唱者或演员的恶劣的表演习惯，刻画出那些情绪不是出自内心的表演动作，嘲笑其浮夸的装腔作势的庸俗的卖弄“技巧”的恶劣作风。奥布拉兹卓夫，在洗练、机智、含蓄的开场白里，就意味深长地接触到主题；他说：“她唱的歌词的内容，我就不介绍了；因为我都不懂。”这不是说艺术家奥布拉兹卓夫自己真不懂得歌词的内容，而是暗示歌词内容没有意义，或影射没有真正懂得歌词内容的歌唱者。如果说并非歌唱者的观众，也可以在发笑之后体会得到不应该这样对待自己的工作，那么，应该如何对待自己的工作的道理也是可以联想到的。如果说，通过这一可笑的歌唱者的丑态，已经揭发了工作不好的艺术家以及非艺术家的恶劣习惯和恶劣作风，那么，这一种木偶戏的作用就不止于引人发笑，也不止于嘲笑着这样一个歌唱者。
    认真地研究了各种类型的人的外型、心理、性格和品质的艺术家，也深刻地理解了猴子、猫、老虎等等动物特殊的动作、姿态、表情。题材用的是有趣的畜类，实质上是讽刺着某种类型的人。例如以男女猴子为主角的“瞬间”，以男女猫为主角的“我想和你在一起呆一会儿”，也都揉合了人和畜的特征。它们很像真实的猫和猴子，也像是在恋爱中暴露着具有虚伪、浮夸和怯懦的性质的人，在急切要达到目的的男猫，那种粗暴、疯狂的动作是人性的，也是猫性的。所有这些猫和猴子，它们在一些小纠葛中所表现出来的激动、引诱、抗拒、温存、悲伤………是人的，也是畜的。运用了洗练而细致的手法所创造的这些生动形象，已经巧妙地把人和畜的某些特征结合起来。这些在合理的基础上虚构出来的情节，这些具有比喻性质的夸张了的形象，充分显示出艺术家的高度的想像力。在这样的形象之前，观众除了感到有趣和可笑之外，也同时感到艺术家对于描写对象的认真的观察、研究和体会。
    这些木偶戏不都是以讽刺为目的，有的却是抒情的。例如“摇篮曲”，就是描写孩子入睡之前给予慈母的小麻烦。这些情节，很幽默很可笑，但使人感到亲切。演员毫不掩饰地站在观众面前，代表母亲，右手套着代表孩子的木偶；由于演技的逼真，虽然他自己没有化装，却使人感到他就是一个慈母。特别是他所操纵的木偶，那些摸母亲嘴唇、和母亲逗趣、吸母亲的手指和狂吻母亲的种种动作，很夸张，也很真实。而总的效果是增强观众母子之间的爱情。
    “摇篮曲”如同醉鬼和女歌唱者那样，在演技上不完全掩饰演员的手（竟从木偶衣内露出演员手背，当成孩子的背来拍拍）。这种半真半假的表演方式，据奥布拉兹卓夫自己的介绍，只宜于小节目；这种方式，如同把自然的树根稍稍加工，造成各式各样的中国某些艺术品（如“佛手”“灵芝”…）
    一样，并不掩饰自然物的特征，却又具备所要创造的事物的特征，因而在一定情况之下，更有趣更吸引人爱好。问题在于：演员是不是在主要方面有所创造。如果孩子不被演得逼真，如果醉鬼和女歌唱者的手的动作没有实感，这种方式就毫无意义。较上述节目更不掩饰演员的手的节目，是“木偶的灵魂”。仅仅是在食指上套着一个圆球，其他手指，有时代表木偶的手臂，有时代表木偶的手指。由于这些手指在摹仿拥抱、沉吟、自负等等动作和心情时很逼真，观众并不误认为艺术家在偷工减料；正相反，他们感谢艺术家创造了有趣的形象。
    善于掌握观众要求的奥布拉兹卓夫，在语言的运用上也是富有创造性和吸引力的。虽然他的木偶戏不违反木偶戏的法则——依靠动作而精简语言，可是他的语言是聪慧的，幽默的，精练的，深刻的，一句话：很富有吸引力和鼓动性。例如：他在讽刺虚伪的男子的节目演出之前，这样说：“一个男人追求女人的时候说：我离开你就活不下去；当女人拒绝了他的爱情的时候，他说：没关系，我不只碰了一次钉子了。我想在座的诸位，不会有这种男子。”这种有趣的而有意义的语言，也常常表现在他的说话里。当他介绍自己之所以把木偶戏作为终身职业时，说到母亲给孩子选择玩具的重要性，说：“在座的，已经做母亲或准备做母亲的，或不准备做母亲而不能不做母亲的，必须注意选择给孩子的礼物。”
    引起观众发笑，是这些木偶戏的特征。而这些笑都是引人向上的，健康的。奥布拉兹卓夫认为：不是任何可笑的题材都可以作为木偶的题材。为了不伤害观众（特别是儿童）的心灵，必须慎重选择题材。我们只能嘲笑旧社会遗留下来的阻碍社会正常发展的愚蠢、懒惰、虚伪，而不能嘲笑痛苦、疾病，或鼓励孩子捉弄人。这一位曾经创造过嘲笑法西斯头子希特勒和墨索里尼的节目的艺术家，对于
    “笑”的掌握是很灵活的，也是有原则的。
    关于对木偶戏这一特殊艺术样式的理解，特殊样式的木偶戏在取材上的特殊要求，为了产生普遍的教育作用而创造典型的经验和方法，如何区别幼年儿童观众与成年观众的合理需要，可贵的民间和民族艺术的重要意义，以及歌舞剧的布景如何才能与样式化的舞姿相和谐等等，这一位热爱中国艺术的中国人民的忠实的友人，这一位拥有几十年木偶戏工作经验的艺术家，发表了许多宝贵的意见；这些意见，对于中国木偶戏（及其它艺术）的成长与壮大，将发挥很大的作用。（附图片）
