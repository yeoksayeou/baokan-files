    Xinhua News Agency, North Vietnam dispatch from Vietnam News Agency: The General Headquarters of the Vietnam People's Army recently issued a communique stating that after the Vietnam People's Army liberated Nghia Lo city in Yen Bai province in northwestern Vietnam on October 17, they pursued the fleeing invading French army, and defeated four more French army companies, capturing more than 100 French soldiers.
    From October 14 to 25, in eleven days, according to incomplete statistics, the Vietnam People's Army annihilated 1,545 French soldiers, with prisoners accounting for two-thirds of them, including one major, nine captains, and nine lieutenants. The captured weapons included eight artillery pieces, thirty-four mortars, three hundred and seventy-seven heavy and light machine guns, eight hundred and ninety rifles, as well as a large number of ammunition, food, and other military supplies. The newly liberated area is about 150 kilometers long and 80 kilometers wide, from the left bank of the Black River to the right bank of the Red River, from Quynh Nhai in Lai Chau province and Than Uyen in Yen Bai province to Van An and Phu Yen in Son La province.
    The rapidly established local people's governments immediately implemented the policies of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam government in the newly liberated areas. The local residents are mostly ethnic minorities such as the Thai, Tho, Muong, Hmong, and Mang. During the French occupation, they were driven by the French army from their villages and concentrated around the French strongholds, where they were cruelly enslaved. Now, they are rejoicing in their liberation. They happily returned to their villages and actively assisted the Vietnam People's Army in searching for scattered remnants of the French army.

    越南人民军总部公布越南西北部战果
    【新华社四日讯】据越南通讯社北越讯：越南人民军总司令部最近发表公报称：越南人民军于十月十七日在越南西北部解放安沛省义路城后，乘胜追击窜逃的侵越法军，又击溃了法军四个连，俘掳了法军一百多人。
    从十月十四日到二十五日的十一天中，据不完全的统计，越南人民军歼灭了法军一千五百四十五名，俘掳的占其中三分之二，内有少校一人、上尉九人、中尉九人。缴获的武器计有大炮八门、迫击炮三十四门、重轻机关枪三百七十七挺、步枪八百九十支以及大批弹药、粮食和其他军用物资。新解放的地区长约一百五十公里、宽约八十公里，从黑水江的左岸一直到红河的右岸，从莱州省的琼崖和安沛省的神渊一直到山萝省的万安和富安。
    迅速建立起来的各地人民政权立即执行了越南民主共和国政府对新解放区的政策。当地居民多半是泰族、吐族、芒族、苗族、孟族等少数民族。他们在法军占领期间，曾被法军从自己的村庄赶到法军据点的周围集中，受到了残酷的奴役，现在都为获得解放而庆幸。他们喜悦地回到自己的村庄，并积极地协助越南人民军搜捕溃散的法军残余。
