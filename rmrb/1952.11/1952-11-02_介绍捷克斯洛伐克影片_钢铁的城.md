	"Steel City" is the first Czechoslovak film with Chinese dialogue to be shown in our country. This film is adapted from Eisen Urban's original work and directed by the famous director Martin Frik. This film won the "Struggle for Social Progress" award at the fifth international film festival held in Karlovy Vary. The Czechoslovak cultural circles praised it as: a film that achieved the victory of the principles of ideology and Party spirit. For Chinese audiences, this film can help us understand the history of the struggle of the Czechoslovak working class and strengthen cultural exchanges between the two peoples, which is very meaningful.

	The plot of the film is as follows: In 1931, the world capitalist economic crisis occurred, and the international bourgeoisie panicked. In order to save themselves from their doom, they did not hesitate to adopt various despicable means to further intensify the exploitation of the working class. The film depicts, on the one hand, the capitalists' attempt to dismiss 450 workers from the Karlovy Vary steel factory in Czechoslovakia by lowering wages and hiring unemployed German workers to replace the original workers, and using various shameful means to undermine the unity of the workers; on the other hand, it also depicts the situation of the workers in the Karlovy Vary steel factory in Czechoslovakia, who, united with unemployed German workers, waged a resolute struggle against the bourgeoisie.

	The Czechoslovak workers of 1931 were different from the workers of Czechoslovakia's past history. They had already seen the victory of socialist construction in the Soviet Union, and at the same time, they had obtained the correct leadership headed by Comrade Gottwald, who was elected at the Fifth Congress of the Czechoslovak Communist Party in February 1929. Therefore, under the leadership of the Communist Party, the workers launched a strike movement under unbearable oppression. In this movement, the working class not only hit the bourgeoisie, but also educated themselves. After the strike movement was launched, the bourgeoisie became even more frantic. They used special agents, military police, as well as threats and inducements to divide the workers and arrest Communist Party members and activists among the workers. They wanted to use high-pressure means to make the workers submit, but the cowardly wishes of the bourgeoisie were in vain. At the end of the film, the ranks of the working class advanced like a surging torrent, they sang the Internationale and marched towards the heavily guarded bridge. Despite the shooting by the military police, the red flag fluttered in the wind, and the hope of mankind appeared before our eyes!

	That is the plot of the film.

	The Czechoslovak workers' movement in 1931, as depicted in this film, was in the following situation: In the old Czechoslovakia, not only the political power, but also the economic hub of the country, was in the hands of large capitalists and landlords. Many industrial sectors were dominated by international cartels and concerns [note]. In the Czech region alone, there were 250 concerns, which owned more than 750 of the largest enterprises in those industrial sectors that actually determined the country's economic lifeline. These concerns controlled 80% of the capital of all enterprises in Czechoslovakia. The industry and finance of the Czechoslovak state were ruled by the largest shareholder banks. In these banks, foreign capital (mainly British and French) had a great influence. When we understand the historical situation at that time, we can fully understand this film. At the beginning of the film, we are introduced to the nervous and anxious situation of the people in the Paris Stock Exchange Hall, the office of the French financial tycoon and arms dealer Eugene Schneider, and the office of Dr. Pritz, the chairman of the mining and metallurgical company and the chairman of the board of directors of forty affiliated companies. These are the behind-the-scenes figures of the bourgeoisie who do not appear much in the film. We continue to see in the film the factory manager Toddel and his bodyguard Otai directing the military police, the secret agent Halik posing as a worker to carry out sabotage, and the Czechoslovak people's leader Gottwald delivering a speech in the National Assembly protesting the persecution of workers, while the bourgeois representatives stomped their feet and whistled. These scenes in the film are a microcosm of the activities of the international bourgeoisie, and these representatives of the bourgeoisie have certain typical characteristics.

	In some literary works that expose the sins of the old society, the author can easily excessively portray the tragic fate of the insulted and persecuted, so that the work loses its power. But the film "Steel City" is not like this. The great artist Gorky once said: "The cause of our writers is a difficult and complex cause. It is not only limited to criticizing the old reality and exposing the infectiousness of the defects of the old reality. Their task is to study, specifically describe, and affirm the new reality by these methods. Young writers must learn to observe how the fire of the future is burning and growing stronger and stronger amidst the smoke of the old corruption."

	"Steel City" is exactly like this. The scenes it brings to us are not only the groans of the oppressed and the pain of unemployment and hunger, but more importantly, it shows how the Czechoslovak working class is organized and led in a fierce struggle with the bourgeoisie. Because this struggle is organized, led, and heroic, this film is full of an optimistic fighting atmosphere, allowing the audience to concretely recognize the strong fighting spirit and the indestructibility of the power of the Czechoslovak working class.

	The reason why this struggle is optimistic and hopeful is because it is after the Soviet Union has achieved the victory of socialist construction. As early as the tenth anniversary of the October Revolution, Marshal Stalin said: "The October Revolution not only shook imperialism, it also established a powerful public foundation for the world revolutionary movement, namely the first proletarian dictatorship. This foundation is something that the world revolutionary movement has never had before, and now it can use this foundation as a backing." The October Revolution established a strong center for the world revolutionary movement. Around this center, the proletarians and oppressed nations of all countries in the world united. When the struggle is not isolated and helpless, and there is also a shining example, the struggle is even more heroic and optimistic. In the film, the workers admire the lives of Soviet workers in their conversations and have unlimited yearning for the political and economic life of the Soviet Union, which is a great encouragement to their struggle.

	The film uses clever techniques to satirize the capitalists' feeling of being at the end of their rope in the face of the power of the united working class, having to resort to tricks, and finally being exposed and revealing their ugliness. Such a description further strengthens the optimistic color of the working class's struggle. We see in the film that when the workers are on strike, the factory chimneys no longer emit smoke. Toddel, the manager of the Karlovy Vary steel factory, and Koderna, the engineer, in order to shake the workers' will to fight the strike to the end, and claiming that they could find other workers (actually there was no way), used deceptive means to move garbage into the boiler to burn, making the factory chimneys emit smoke, deceiving the striking workers outside the factory, and letting them think that their strike line had been disintegrated and that many workers had gone to work in the factory. This kind of deception and sabotage was done personally by the factory manager and several running dogs of the capitalists. When the striking workers saw the thick smoke in the chimneys and were feeling confused, they suddenly heard a burst of explosions. The reason for the explosion was that the manager and his running dogs had no experience in burning furnaces. The workers personally saw the farce performed by the manager Toddel and others: their faces were blackened by smoke and fire, and they walked out of the boiler room in a state of disarray. This ironic technique strengthened the unity of the working class and the optimistic mood of the struggle, and exposed the hypocritical, deceptive, and cowardly nature of the bourgeoisie.

	The film's handling of historical themes in this way is appropriate. First of all, the author and director have grasped the historical situation at that time, so that the film can truly depict history. And this description is not cumbersome or rigid in the film, but summarizes and concentrates historical facts. Therefore, this film not only shows the heroic struggle between the working class and the bourgeoisie, but also permeates the spirit of socialist revolution to educate and improve the thinking of the working class. Through artistic images and the depiction of workers' lives, the film makes people more clearly realize that the working class can only win through unity and struggle, and that compromise and retreat have no way out. The film criticizes those individual workers who purely solve personal life problems and disrupt the strike, because these individual workers eventually fall into a tragic fate, which powerfully educates us on the necessity of fighting for all working people.

	The film "Steel City," because of its sharp and faithful depiction of class relations, filling ideas with flesh and blood, is full of power, has great persuasiveness and inspiration.

	[Note] "Cartel" and "Concern" are both forms of capitalist enterprise association. "Cartel" is an agreement signed by various capitalist enterprises in order to maintain a standard price. "Concern" is a group of enterprises in which various capitalist enterprises establish various connections and combinations due to their financial interdependence.

    介绍捷克斯洛伐克影片“钢铁的城”
    邹荻帆
    原著：艾生·厄本编剧：奥达卡·克巨那导演：马丁·弗立克
    翻译：陈叙一  捷克斯洛伐克国家制片厂出品上海电影制片厂配音译制
    “钢铁的城”是第一部配有华语对白在我国放映的捷克斯洛伐克影片。这部电影系根据艾生·厄本的原著改编，由名导演马丁·弗立克导演。这部影片曾在卡罗伐维所举行的五届国际电影节中获得“社会进步斗争”奖，捷克斯洛伐克的文化界曾称誉它是：取得思想性与党性的原则的胜利的一部影片。对中国观众来说，这部影片可以帮助我们了解捷克斯洛伐克的工人阶级的斗争历史和加强两国人民的文化交流，这是很有意义的事情。
    影片的情节是这样的：一九三一年资本主义发生世界经济危机，国际资产阶级恐慌万状。他们为了拯救自己的厄运，不惜采取各种卑鄙的手段，对工人阶级更进一步加紧压榨。影片一方面描写了资本家为了企图解雇捷克斯洛伐克卡洛伐虚钢铁工厂的四百五十名工人，用降低工资的办法，雇佣失业的德国工人来代替原来的工人，并使用各种可耻手段，破坏工人的团结；同时也描写了捷克斯洛伐克卡洛伐虚钢铁工厂的工人联合德国失业的工人与资产阶级进行坚决斗争的情况。
    一九三一年的捷克斯洛伐克工人与捷克斯洛伐克过去历史上的工人是不同的。他们已经看到苏联取得了社会主义建设的胜利，同时又获得了在一九二九年二月第五次捷克斯洛伐克共产党代表大会上选出的以哥特瓦尔德同志为首的正确领导。因此，工人们在共产党的领导下，在无可忍受的压榨下，展开了罢工运动。在这一运动中，工人阶级不但打击了资产阶级，而且他们自己也受到了教育。罢工运动展开后，资产阶级更形疯狂。他们利用特务、宪警，以及威胁、利诱的手段来分化工人，逮捕工人中的共产党员和积极分子。他们想用高压的手段使工人们屈服，但是资产阶级的懦怯的愿望是徒然的。在影片结尾时，工人阶级的队伍像汹涌的洪流一样前进着，他们高唱国际歌走向警卫森严的桥梁，尽管宪警们开枪射击，但狂风中飘扬着红旗，人类的希望出现在我们眼前！
    影片的情节就是这样的。
    这部影片所描写的一九三一年的捷克斯洛伐克工人运动，是处在这样的情况下：旧的捷克斯洛伐克，不仅政权，而且国家的经济枢纽，都操在大资本家和地主的手里。许多工业部门都由国际的卡特尔和康采恩〔注〕支配。仅在捷克州一州，就有二百五十个康采恩，它们在实际决定国家经济命脉的那些工业部门中，拥有七百五十个以上的最大企业。这些康采恩掌握着捷克斯洛伐克全部企业百分之八十的资本。捷克斯洛伐克国家的工业与财政，为最大的股东银行所统治。在这些银行里，外国资本（主要是英国、法国的）具有很大的势力。当我们了解了当时的历史情况后，就更能充分了解这部影片了。影片一开始，就介绍了巴黎证券所大厅、法国金融巨头军火大王尤琴·史纳德的办公室和矿务冶金公司的董事长兼四十个联营公司理事会理事长普利兹博士的办公室里的人们神经紧张、惶恐不安的情形。这是在影片上没有多露面的，资产阶级的幕后人物。我们从影片里继续看到了工厂经理陶德尔及其保镖奥太指挥着宪警，特务哈利克伪冒工人进行破坏，以及捷克斯洛伐克人民领袖哥特瓦尔德在国会上发表抗议迫害工人的演说时，资产阶级代表们蹬脚、吹哨的情形。影片里的这些场景是国际资产阶级活动的缩影，这些代表资产阶级的人物，都是有一定的典型性的。
    某一些暴露旧社会罪恶的文学作品中，作者很容易过分刻划受侮辱与受迫害者的悲惨的命运，以致使作品失去了力量。而影片“钢铁的城”却不是如此的。伟大的艺术家高尔基曾经这样讲过：“我们作家们的事业，是困难而复杂的事业，它并不只限于批判旧现实，及揭发旧现实之缺陷的传染性。他们的任务，是研究、具体地描写，并借着这些手法来肯定新现实。青年作家们，必须学习观察在旧的腐败物冒烟当中，未来的火是怎样地燃烧起来，怎样的越燃越旺。”
    “钢铁的城”正是这样，它给我们带来的场景，不仅是受压榨的人们的呻吟和失业、饥饿的痛苦，更重要的，是表现了捷克斯洛伐克工人阶级在如何有组织、有领导地与资产阶级进行着激烈的斗争。由于这斗争是有组织、有领导的，而又是英勇的，因此这部影片充满了乐观的战斗气氛，使观众具体地认识到捷克斯洛伐克工人阶级斗争性的坚强和力量之不可摧折。
    这斗争所以是乐观的、有希望的，是由于它是在苏联已经取得了社会主义建设的胜利之后。早在十月革命十周年时，斯大林大元帅就这样说过：“十月革命不仅动摇了帝国主义，它同时还为世界革命运动建立了强大的公开的基础，即第一个无产阶级专政，这个基础是世界革命运动从来未曾有过的，而现在它却能把这个基础作为靠山了。”十月革命为世界革命运动建立了一个强大的中心，围绕着这个中心，全世界各国的无产者和被压迫的民族团结了起来。当斗争不是孤立无援，而又有着光辉的榜样的时候，斗争就更英勇而乐观。影片中的工人们在谈话中都羡慕着苏联工人的生活，对苏联的政治、经济生活无限地向往，这对他们的斗争是很大的鼓舞。
    影片以巧妙的手法，讥讽了资本家在工人阶级团结一致的威力前，感到途穷路绝，不得不耍弄花招，而终于被揭露现出了丑态。这样的描写，更加重了工人阶级战斗的乐观色彩。我们从影片里看到当工人们罢工的时候，工厂的烟囱已经不再冒烟了。卡洛伐虚钢铁厂的经理陶德尔和工程师柯得那，为了动摇工人罢工斗争到底的意志，表示自己能够另外找到工人（实际上是毫无办法），便以谎骗的手段，把垃圾搬到锅炉中去烧，使工厂的烟囱冒烟，欺骗厂外罢工的工人，让他们以为他们的罢工阵线已被瓦解了，工厂已有很多工人上工了。这种欺骗和捣鬼是该厂经理和几个资本家的走狗亲自动手作的。当罢工的工人们看到烟囱里的浓烟，正感惶惑的时候，突然听到一阵爆炸声，爆炸的原因是经理和走狗们没有烧炉子的经验造成的。工人们亲眼看到了经理陶德尔等所演的丑剧：他们被烟火薰黑了脸，狼狈不堪地从锅炉房走出来。这种讽刺的手法，使工人阶级的团结一致和斗争的乐观情绪更加强了，使资产阶级的虚伪、欺骗、卑怯的本质揭露了出来。
    影片这样处理历史题材是恰当的，首先作者与导演掌握了当时的历史情况，使影片能够真实地将历史描写出来。而这种描写，在影片里又不是繁琐或死板的，而是把历史事实加以概括和集中。所以这部影片，不但表现了工人阶级与资产阶级的英勇斗争，而且也把以社会主义的革命精神，去教育和提高工人阶级的思想贯串在影片里。影片通过艺术形象和工人生活的描写，使人们更清楚地认识到工人阶级只有团结、斗争才有胜利，妥协和后退都是没有出路的。影片批判了那些纯粹为解决个人生活问题，而破坏罢工的个别工人，因为这些个别的工人最后依然陷入悲惨的命运，这就强有力地教育了我们为一切劳动大众而战的必要。
    影片“钢铁的城”，由于它对阶级间的关系作了尖锐和忠实的描写，以肉和血充实着思想，所以它充满了力量，有很大的说服力和鼓舞力。
    〔注〕“卡特尔”和“康采恩”均为资本主义企业的一种联合形式。“卡特尔”是资本主义各个企业为了要维持一个标准价格而订立的一种协定。“康采恩”是资本主义各企业由于金融上彼此互相依赖，而建立的各种联系和结合的企业集团。
