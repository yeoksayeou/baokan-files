    US Air Force Chief of Staff Vandenberg
    Clamors to Expand the War of Aggression Against Korea

    Xinhua News Agency, 21st Dispatch: American aggressors continue to clamor for expanding the war of aggression against Korea.

    US Air Force Chief of Staff Vandenberg, while ranting in Seoul on the 19th, stated that the US Air Force is prepared to attack Northeast China, as long as Washington gives the order.

    Gould, the Washington correspondent for the Chicago "Sun-Times," which previously reported Clark's request for reinforcements in Korea, mocked Clark's denial as "merely a matter of wording." Gould further reported that senior officials in Washington had reaffirmed that Clark had indeed made such a request. A senior military officer also said that Van Fleet had requested the Department of Defense to send more troops to Korea as early as September.

    叫嚣扩大侵朝战争
    【新华社二十一日讯】美国侵略者继续叫嚣扩大侵朝战争。
    美国空军参谋长范顿伯十九日在汉城叫嚷说，只要华盛顿有命令，美国空军准备袭击我国东北。
    曾经报道克拉克要求增兵朝鲜的芝加哥“太阳时报”驻华盛顿记者谷乌，讥笑克拉克的否认“不过是一种词令而已”。谷乌进一步报道说：华盛顿的高级官员再度证实克拉克曾作过这样的要求。一位高级军官并说，范佛里特早在九月间就要求国防部增派更多的军队到朝鲜去。
