    The CPC Xinhua County Committee in Hunan Province Failed to Carry Out Party Building Work According to the Central Committee's Party Building Policy
    By Our Reporter Shang Kai
    On the progress statistics table of party building work of the Organization Department of the CPC Shaoyang Prefectural Committee in Hunan Province, there is a striking figure, that is, Xinhua County, in a short period of less than three months, overfulfilled the party building task for the second half of this year by 121.75%. And the cadre conditions and work foundation in Xinhua County are not better than other regions. This makes people particularly pay attention. In mid-October, the reporter visited Xinhua County for this purpose.
    It cannot be denied that the party building work in Xinhua County has achieved certain results. In this party building, a group of outstanding elements were indeed admitted into the Party, the Party's organization was expanded, the Party's connection with the masses was strengthened, and a group of outstanding new Party members were promoted to district cadres, enriching the leadership institutions of the districts. However, on the other hand, the mistake of lowering the standards for Party members in admitting Party members occurred.
    The First and Fourth Districts of the county are the two districts with better party building work in the county, but judging from the results of the Shaoyang Prefectural Committee's inspection of the First District's party building work, among the 21 new Party members developed in the entire district, three obviously did not meet the standards of Communist Party members; for example, one had always been irresponsible in his work and was not yet old enough to join the Party, and one was of bad character and unstable in his position. The Organization Department of the County Committee also sent people to Mushan Township in the Fifth District to inspect the party building work, and found that among the two Party members developed in Mushan Township, one was not highly conscious and could not play the role of a Communist Party member in his work. The local masses criticized this. They said: If such people are Communist Party members, then we can all join the Communist Party. According to the estimation of the Organization Department of the County Committee, this situation is relatively common.
    Why did such a serious mistake occur in the party building work in Xinhua County? The main reason is that the leaders of party building work—the CPC Xinhua County Committee—did not study or did not study enough the principles, policies, methods, and steps of party building work determined by the Central Committee, and there was a purely task-oriented viewpoint.
    Although the Xinhua County Committee, according to the instructions of the superior Party organization, deployed the work of cultivating activists in conjunction with the review of land reform in November last year to prepare for party building, according to the former Secretary of the County Committee, Yin Zixi, he was not clear about the task of cultivating activists at that time, and once thought this way: Activists will appear in every movement, and we still need to cultivate them. He never thought that activists should be cultivated according to the standards of Communist Party members. Therefore, after the County Committee deployed the work of cultivating activists, it never inspected this work. Although the Organization Department of the County Committee paid more attention to this, it was limited to instructions. The district committees believed that after various social reform movements in the past three years, each township had ten or twenty activists. Some people said: "We can touch a batch of activists with our eyes closed, and we can send them to the county whenever the county needs them." Under the domination of this thought, only the First and Fourth Districts did some investigation and education work for activists, while other districts perfunctorily talked about communism and the Communist Party at cadre meetings, and regarded this as the investigation and education work for activists. In this way, the work of cultivating activists in conjunction with the review of land reform in the whole county fell through.
    In April of this year, the County Committee opened a party building training class, requiring each district to recommend activists to receive training. The district committees had to "touch activists with their eyes closed." Zhang Baowen, the current secretary of the Xinhua County Committee, was the deputy secretary of the Fifth District Committee at that time. He said: "At that time, the county wanted how many, and I notified each township to send how many." The Tenth District Committee pieced together a list of activists, and the Twentieth District Committee opened a list of township cadres, peasant association group leaders, militiamen, etc., and sent it to the county as a list of "activists." The composition of the students in the party building training class was very impure, and this phenomenon became more serious from one phase to the next. Taking those with unstable positions and bad character as an example, the first phase accounted for 8.5% of the total number of students, the second phase accounted for 18.8%, and the third phase accounted for 24.7%. After the third phase, although the County Committee proposed that it must be reviewed by the three-level party organizations of the county, district, and township, the fourth phase still accounted for 16.3%.
    The County Committee discovered the above-mentioned serious situation in the first phase, but because it did not well understand the Central Committee's party building principles and policies, it not only did not correct it, but also made new mistakes. Although the students in the first phase of the training class were not strictly selected, there were still some outstanding figures among the working people. After a period of education and investigation, they could be accepted into the Party. However, the County Committee and the leading cadres of the training class did not conduct specific analysis of the students in the training class, and none of them were accepted into the Party. For example, Su Chuanming and Su Chuangao, the activists sent by the Seventeenth District, have been resolute in their struggle, responsible in their work, and connected with the masses since rent reduction. From all aspects, they have indeed met the eight conditions of Communist Party members and can be accepted as Party members; however, because someone said that Su Chuanming and others had embezzled, after investigation, this was not the case, but the County Committee was still not at ease and did not absorb them into the Party. Some activists therefore became passive, affecting the progress of the township's work.
    When the third phase of the training class began, it coincided with the convening of the organizational work conference of the CPC Shaoyang Prefectural Committee. At that time, each county had a similar phenomenon of being tied up as Xinhua County, so this meeting criticized this phenomenon. However, the Xinhua County Committee did not understand the spirit of the meeting enough, and deviated to the other side. After returning to the county, it was eager to achieve quick results and carried out party building work hastily. Without conducting specific analysis of the students in the third phase, it rigidly determined to accept 50% of them into the Party. The organization committee members or organization cadres of each district also worked in the training class with the spirit of "great development." Whether in the group meeting to discuss the admission of new Party members or in the general meeting of the branch, these cadres emphasized the advantages of the development object and concealed and reduced the shortcomings of the development object in order to develop more Party members. On this issue, the County Committee and the District Committee had some disputes, but in the end, the County Committee agreed with the District Committee's opinion. For example, when discussing the issue of admitting the 22 people who did not meet the conditions for Party membership in the fourth phase, the County Committee decided not to develop these people into Party members, but the relevant district cadres insisted that these people could be absorbed into the Party. As a result of the dispute, the County Committee agreed with this wrong opinion and decided to accept a part first, and each district would accept a part after returning. Many people who did not meet the conditions for Party membership were admitted into the Party in this way. Liu Quanging, one of the persons in charge of the training class at that time, said: "At that time, the leaders also felt that it was inappropriate to develop these people, but if they were not developed, the task would not be completed. Therefore, let's just 'make do,' and we can educate them after they are accepted anyway." Zhu Bin, who had worked in the training class, also remembered such a thing: Once, when she was about to sign and seal a new Party member's application form for joining the Party, she found that the applicant's awareness was still low and did not meet the conditions for joining the Party. Zhu Bin hesitated and asked Guo Guangzhi, one of the leaders of the training class, for instructions. Guo Guangzhi said: "Let's just do it, approve him to join the Party." In this way, Xinhua County's party building work was overfulfilled by 21.75%. Originally, the Xinhua County Committee also planned to hold another collective training for 1,500 activists by the end of this year, and develop 45% of them into Party members. This plan was corrected by the Hunan Provincial Committee.
    Now the County Committee has paid attention to this issue and is preparing to conduct a comprehensive and in-depth inspection of the party building work in the county, summarize the lessons, and hold collective training for new Party members in batches to establish and improve the Party's grassroots organizations in the townships.
    According to the situation of the district cadre meeting recently held in this county, some district cadres have not yet realized their mistakes. They believe that "there is no problem in our district." Therefore, in order to thoroughly correct this deviation, a series of inspection and education work must be carried out, especially to make everyone deeply understand the Central Committee's principles and policies on party building work, as well as the prescribed steps and methods, and to inspect the party building work in the county according to these principles and policies.

### 中共湖南新化县委没有按照中央的建党方针进行建党工作

    中共湖南新化县委没有按照中央的建党方针进行建党工作
    本报记者  商恺
    在中共湖南邵阳地委组织部的建党工作进度统计表上，有一行引人注意的数字，即新化县在短短的不到三个月时间里，超额完成了今年下半年建党任务百分之一百二十一点七五。而新化县的干部条件和工作基础并不比其他地区好。这样就格外使人注意。十月中旬，记者为此访问了新化县。
    不能否认，新化县的建党工作是有一定的成绩的。在此次建党中，确也接收了一批优秀分子入党，扩大了党的组织，密切了党和群众的联系，并提拔了一批优秀的新党员为区干部，充实了区的领导机构。但是另一方面，却发生了降低党员标准接收党员的错误。
    这个县的一区和四区是全县建党工作较好的两个区，但从邵阳地委对一区建党工作的检查结果来看，在全区所发展的二十一个新党员中，有三人是显然不符合共产党员标准的；例如有一个对工作一贯不负责任，还不到入党年龄，有一个品质恶劣，立场不稳。县委组织部也曾派人到五区木山乡检查建党工作，发现在木山乡所发展的两个党员中，就有一个觉悟不高，还不能在工作中起一个共产党员作用的党员。当地群众对此提出了批评。他们说：这样的人是共产党员，咱们都可以加入共产党了。据县委组织部估计，这种情况是比较普遍的。
    为什么新化县的建党工作发生如此严重的错误？主要是由于建党工作的领导者——中共新化县委对于中央所确定的建党工作的方针、政策以及方法和步骤，没有研究，或研究得不够，存在着单纯任务观点。
    新化县委虽然在去年十一月曾根据上级党的指示，布置了结合土地改革复查工作培养积极分子，为建党作好准备工作。但据前任县委书记尹子席谈，当时他对于培养积极分子这一任务是不明确的，曾经这样想：每个运动中都会出现积极分子，还要培养。根本没有想到应当根据共产党员标准来培养积极分子。所以县委在布置培养积极分子工作后，未曾对这一工作进行过检查。县委组织部对此虽然比较注意，但也只限于指示。各区委则认为三年来经过各种社会改革运动，每个乡都有十个二十个积极分子。有人说：“闭着眼睛就可以摸一批积极分子，县里什么时候要，就什么时候送到。”在这种思想支配之下，只有一区和四区对积极分子作了一些考察和教育工作，其他各区都敷衍塞责地在干部会上讲了一讲共产主义和共产党，就算对积极分子进行了考察和教育工作。这样全县结合土地改革复查培养积极分子的工作就落空了。
    今年四月县委开办建党训练班，要各区保送积极分子去受训，各区区委就不得不“闭着眼睛去摸”积极分子了。现任新化县委会的秘书张保文，就是当时的五区区委副书记。他说：“那时县里要多少，我就通知各乡送多少。”十区区委拼凑了一个积极分子名单，二十区区委把全区乡干部、农民协会小组长、民兵等名字开了一个单子，当作“积极分子”名单往县里送。建党训练班的学员成分就非常不纯，而且这种现象一期比一期严重。以立场不稳、品质恶劣者说，第一期占学员总人数百分之八点五，第二期占百分之十八点八，第三期占百分之二十四点七。第三期以后，虽然县委提出必须经过县、区、乡三级党的组织审查，但第四期仍占有百分之十六点三。
    上述的严重情况，县委在第一期就发现了，但因没有很好领会中央的建党方针、政策，不但没有加以纠正，而且发生了新的错误。第一期训练班的学员，虽然没有经过严格的挑选，其中也还有一些是劳动人民中的优秀人物。这些人经过一个时期的教育和考察之后，即可接收入党。但是县委和训练班的领导干部对训练班的学员却不进行具体分析，一律都不接收入党。例如十七区送来的积极分子苏传明、苏传诰，减租以来，斗争坚决，工作负责，联系群众，从各方面看，他们确已具备了共产党员标准的八项条件可以接收为党员；却因有人说苏传明等二人有贪污行为，经调查，并没有这回事，而县委仍不放心，没有吸收他们入党。有些积极分子因此消极起来，影响了乡的工作的进展。
    第三期训练班开始时，正赶上中共邵阳地委召开组织工作会议。当时各县都存在着与新化县相似的束手束脚的现象，因而这个会议对此种现象进行了批判。而新化县委对于会议的精神领会不够，又偏到了另一方面，回县后，便急于求成，草率进行建党工作。对第三期学员不进行具体分析，就硬性确定接收其中百分之五十入党。各区的组织委员或组织干事，也抱着“大发展”的精神在训练班工作。这些干部无论在讨论接收新党员的小组会上，或支部大会上，都强调发展对象的优点，掩饰和缩小发展对象的缺点，以达到多发展几个党员的目的。在这个问题上，县委和区委曾发生了一些争论，而最后，县委却同意了区委的意见。例如在讨论第四期中不够入党条件的二十二个人的入党问题时，县委决定不发展这些人为党员，但是有关的区干部却坚持可以吸收这些人入党。争论结果，县委同意了这种错误意见，决定先接收一部分，各区回去后再接收一部分。有很多不够入党条件的人就是这样被接收入党的。当时训练班负责人之一的刘泉清说：“当时领导上也感觉到发展这些人不恰当，但是不发展就完不成任务。因此，就‘差点吧’，反正接收后还可以教育。”曾在训练班工作过的朱彬还记得这样的事情：有一次她要在一个新党员的入党志愿书上签名盖章时，发现这个申请入党者觉悟还低，还不具备入党条件。朱彬就犹豫起来，去请示训练班领导人之一的郭广志。郭广志说：“就这样吧，批准他入党吧”，这样新化县的建党工作就超额百分之二十一点七五完成了。本来新化县委还计划到今年年底再集训一千五百名积极分子，从中再发展百分之四十五的人入党。这个计划被湖南省委纠正了。
    现在县委已经注意这一个问题，准备对全县的建党工作作一次普遍的深入的检查，总结教训，并分批集训新党员，建立与健全乡的党基层组织。
    根据这个县最近召开的区干部会议的情形看，有些区干部还没有认识自己的错误，他们认为“我们区没问题”。因此要彻底纠正这一偏向，必须进行一系列的检查和教育工作，特别要使大家深刻领会中央关于建党工作的方针和政策，以及所规定的步骤、方法，并根据这些方针政策来检查全县的建党工作。
