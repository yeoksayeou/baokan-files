    Asians Unite to Crush the US Imperialist Conspiracy of Using Asians to Fight Asians
    Gu Tian
    US imperialism is the most ferocious enemy of the Asian people, the European people, and the people of the whole world. This undeniable crime was once again confessed by the newly elected US President Eisenhower during his campaign. According to the original text of Eisenhower's campaign speech in Champaign, Illinois, on October 2nd, published by the New York Times on October 3rd, it was none other than this newly elected US President who shouted loudly: "Let Asians fight Asians." An American journalist named Stone published an article in the New York Compass on October 28th, writing: "Eisenhower once said: 'Let Asians fight.' This sentence sounds very harsh in Asia, where it means: 'Let Asians be cannon fodder.'" Indeed, Eisenhower's words are harsh. However, isn't it equally harsh in the ears of Europeans? Why? Because, since US imperialism's aggressive policy in Asia is to use Asians to fight Asians, one can imagine that US imperialism's aggressive policy in Europe is, of course, to use Europeans to fight Europeans. Isn't this the most logical deduction?
    US imperialism's delusion of using Asians to fight Asians and Europeans to fight Europeans is by no means due to an accidental motive, let alone Eisenhower's casual remarks, but rather due to the fact that US imperialism's basic strategy cannot be otherwise. If it were otherwise, it would not be enough to launch a war of aggression, and even if it were launched, it would not be enough to continue supporting such a war of aggression. First of all, it is necessary to understand a basic situation: the war of aggression that US imperialism is trying to carry out is, in nature, the most unpopular and most unjust war. At the same time, this is not a small-scale, limited-scope war of aggression, but the largest-scale, widest-scope war of aggression, that is, a war of aggression with a global character. As far as human history is concerned, no aggressor nation has ever planned such a global war of aggression. Fascist Germany planned to conquer Europe, and fascist Japan planned to conquer Asia. However, US imperialism's plan to conquer the world today can be said to be a compilation of the two huge aggression plans of fascist Germany and fascist Japan. According to US imperialism's war of aggression plan, it is bound to include the three continents of Europe, Asia, and Africa, and it is also bound to include the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans. Finally, it is bound to include North and South America and Australia. In this way, US imperialism is bound to establish hundreds of bases and open up dozens of battlefields around the world. Anyone who has studied military affairs and participated in war cannot help but ask, how much manpower can US imperialism possibly muster to realize such a largest-scale, widest-scope war of aggression plan? According to statistics from the US Department of the Army, the highest number of mobilizations in the United States during World War II was 12,364,000 people. What about Germany? The highest number of mobilizations in Germany during World War II was 10,020,000 people (including Austria). What about Japan? The highest number of mobilizations in Japan during World War II was 6,095,000 people. The two fascist countries of Germany and Japan themselves had a mobilization number of 16,295,000 people, failed to conquer Europe and Asia, and suffered a disastrous defeat. US imperialism itself has only a mobilization number of 12,364,000 people and plans to conquer the world. Is it feasible? Of course not. In addition, US imperialism, because the domestic people oppose war, cannot but fear death, which makes it even more difficult. Precisely because it is not feasible and precisely because it is difficult, US imperialism has come up with a conspiracy to use Asians to fight Asians and Europeans to fight Europeans.
    Let us look at the report on World War II submitted by US Chief of Staff Marshall in September 1945. In this report, Marshall made a settlement for the manpower of the United States. After careful calculation, this Chief of Staff regretfully admitted a fact: the US ground forces were insufficient. According to Marshall's estimate, the maximum number of healthy Americans capable of military service was only 15 million to 16 million. First of all, the Navy and shipping would take up a large number of personnel. Therefore, the basic number of the Army (including the Air Force under the Army at that time) had to be stipulated as 7.7 million. This number once increased to 8.3 million in 1945. According to the Department of the Army statistics, it was 8,266,373 people. According to Marshall's calculation, the disabled accounted for 500,000, and reinforcements accounted for 100,000. In total, about 600,000 people did not participate in the battle. Subtracting 600,000 from 8.3 million is still 7.7 million. Among these 7.7 million people, the Air Force under the Army first accounted for 2.34 million, the logistics system accounted for 1,751,000, and the forces directly under the command of various war zones accounted for 423,000. As a result, the ground forces, that is, the field forces, were left with only 3,186,000. The US Air Force became an independent system after July 1947. According to the Air Force Department's post-hoc statistics, in 1944, the Air Force under the US Army was 2,411,294 people, which was 70,000 more than Marshall's number. Now, using Marshall's number as the standard, subtracting the 2.34 million people of the Air Force under the Army from the total number of 7.7 million Army, leaves 5.36 million people. These 5.36 million people are the true basic number of the US Army in World War II. Adding Marshall's 500,000 disabled people and 100,000 reinforcements constitutes a figure of 5.96 million people. Comparing 5.96 million with the highest mobilization number of the United States in World War II, 12,364,000, roughly five out of ten shares. The Air Force's 2.34 million is roughly two out of ten shares. According to the US Navy Department statistics, the highest number of the US Navy in World War II was 3,380,817 people, which is roughly three out of ten shares. It can be seen from this that the distribution of the total wartime mobilization of the United States among the three services is three for the Navy, two for the Air Force, and five for the Army. Anyone who has studied military affairs and participated in war understands that decisive battles and occupation rely on the Army, ground forces, and field forces. It just so happens that US imperialism lacks the Army, ground forces, and field forces. This is a fatal weakness.
    The war of aggression against Korea is, for US imperialism, first of all, a most serious political failure, and at the same time, it is a most serious military failure. The Korean War is not only a ruthless test for the US Army, Navy, and Air Force, but more importantly, it is a ruthless test for US imperialism's strategic plan to conquer Asia, conquer Europe, and conquer the world. When it comes to the glorious achievements of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, they should not only be measured by the results of the Korean battlefield itself, but must be measured by the serious blow that the glorious victory of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers has dealt to US imperialism's basic strategic plan to conquer Asia, conquer Europe, and conquer the world. This serious blow first of all does not fall on other issues, but precisely falls on the manpower issue in US imperialism's strategic plan. According to the joint war report issued by the Supreme Command of the Korean People's Army and the Command of the Chinese People's Volunteers on October 24, 1952: From October 25, 1950, to October 15, 1952, the Korean-Chinese troops jointly killed, wounded, and captured 661,034 enemy troops, including 291,011 US aggressor troops, 348,045 Rhee puppet troops, 18,578 accomplice troops from the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, etc., and 3,400 accomplice troops from Turkey, France, Thailand, the Philippines, Greece, etc. These figures have fully proved the great damage to the enemy's vital forces in the Korean War. Looking at the war situation in October 1952, according to the Xinhua News Agency dispatch from the Korean front on the 15th, in the October operations, the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers jointly wiped out 63,841 enemy troops (including 6,519 enemy troops killed and wounded by artillery units in artillery battles, and 4,662 enemy troops killed and wounded by snipers), including 24,884 US troops, 322 British troops, 233 French troops, 313 Canadian troops, and 38,089 Rhee puppet troops. It should also be pointed out that since the start of the armistice negotiations on July 10, 1951, the Korean War has become a protracted positional war between the enemy and us. In mobile warfare, we can annihilate a large number of enemy vital forces. In positional warfare, are we equally able to annihilate a large number of enemy vital forces? It is now proved that, due to the increasing strength of the Korean-Chinese troops, we are fully capable of annihilating a large number of enemy vital forces in positional warfare. In October 1952, in the small battlefield near Shangganling, north of Jinhua, which had only a few hills, the enemy was killed and wounded more than 18,000 people in 24 days of fighting. This number is 5,000 more than the total number of enemies annihilated in the first major victory of the Volunteer Army's entry into Korea (the Battle of Yunshan) (more than 13,000 people). This proves that if US imperialism refuses to stop the war in Korea, it cannot avoid continuing to suffer a large loss of vital forces.
    The spokesperson of the Command of the Chinese People's Volunteers spoke well in his "Remarks on Several Issues Concerning the Korean War Situation" on the eve of the second anniversary of the Chinese People's Volunteers' entry into Korea: "US imperialism, which is attempting to launch a world war, is already in a strategically overwhelmed predicament. On the short Korean front of more than 200 kilometers, the US military's forces here account for one-third of its army divisions and more than one-fifth of its air force. In the past two years, the US aggressors have used forces totaling 1.5 million people in the Korean War, accounting for 41 percent of its existing armed forces nationwide. It is conceivable how difficult it is for the United States to fight a world war." In order to study the strategic predicament in which US imperialism finds itself, we must review the situation after World War II. After World War II, US imperialism had demobilized. This state of demobilization was largely maintained until the outbreak of the war of aggression against Korea. Looking at the statistics for 1949, according to the data from the US Army Department, Navy Department, and Air Force Department, the total number of US Army personnel in this year was 658,694; the total number of Navy personnel was 414,110; and the total number of Air Force personnel was 419,347. In the first half of 1950, these figures did not change much. With the war of aggression against Korea, the basic situation changed. The state of demobilization has been broken, and a state of partial mobilization has emerged. According to the figures publicly released by the "US News & World Report" magazine published on June 27, 1952, before the Korean War, the total number of US Army personnel was 590,000; the total number of Navy personnel was 380,000; the total number of Marine Corps personnel was 74,000; the total number of Air Force personnel was 411,000; and the total number of the three services was 1,455,000. After the Korean War, as of the first half of 1952, the total number of US Army personnel was 1,650,000; the total number of Navy personnel was 813,000; the total number of Marine Corps personnel was 243,000; the total number of Air Force personnel was 960,000; and the total number of the three services was 3,666,000. Compared with the 1,455,000 people before the war of aggression against Korea, it has increased by 2,211,000 people. Comparing the number of 3,666,000 people with the highest mobilization number of the United States in World War II, 12,364,000, it can be seen that US imperialism has now taken out almost one-third or a little more than one-quarter of the military manpower it can mobilize. Even according to Marshall's estimate that the United States can mobilize 15 million to 16 million people in the war, then one-quarter of the military manpower has now been taken out. A Korean battlefield, including the front and rear, has already cost US imperialism 1.5 million military manpower in its strategic plan. Ten Korean battlefields would exhaust US imperialism's military manpower. In US imperialism's strategic plan to conquer Asia, conquer Europe, and conquer the world, which is of the largest scale and the widest scope, how can there be only ten Korean battlefields? In this way, if US imperialism relies solely on its own military manpower in strategy, it will not be able to wage a war of aggression.
    In the situation of having too large aggression plans and too little military manpower, using Asians to fight Asians and Europeans to fight Europeans has become the basic strategy of US imperialism. Eisenhower, who first served as a general and then became president, is the most favored figure in the eyes of the US monopoly bourgeoisie to implement this basic strategy. However, Eisenhower, who personally led the European vassal states of US imperialism to expand their armies and prepare for war, did not achieve good results during his tenure as the so-called "Supreme Commander" of the North Atlantic aggressive forces. Taking the United Kingdom as an example, according to a United Press dispatch from London on October 5, 1952, officials revealed that the current total number of the British Army, Navy, and Air Force has reached 872,000, including 453,000 in the Army. Taking France as an example, according to a Reuters dispatch from Paris on May 10, 1952, French Defense Minister Pleven announced on May 6 that the current total number of the French Army, Navy, and Air Force has reached 885,000, including 642,000 in the Army. The United Kingdom and France are currently the two major important vassal states of US imperialism in Europe, and their difficulties in expanding their armies and preparing for war are still so great, let alone others. Here, we must mention the so-called European Defense Community Treaty signed on May 27, 1952, and the so-called European Army plan. This is US imperialism's "masterpiece" of using Europeans to fight Europeans. Arming West Germany is also carried out through the so-called European Defense Community and the so-called European Army. Using Europeans to fight Europeans is, of course, a "way out" for US imperialism, but it is a dead end for the vassal states of US imperialism. It is an extremely hot potato for British imperialism to take chestnuts out of the fire for US imperialism. Therefore, US imperialism's creation of war is tantamount to creating contradictions within the imperialist bloc.
    The people of Europe have long seen through Eisenhower's conspiracy to use Europeans to fight Europeans. In January 1951, when Eisenhower went to Western Europe to "honorably" serve as the so-called "Supreme Commander" of the Atlantic aggressive forces, the people of France, Italy, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Denmark, and West Germany successively held demonstrations, shouting: "Eisenhower, get out!". Eisenhower got out. Due to the implementation of the aggressive policy of using Europeans to fight Europeans, Eisenhower has won the favor of the US monopoly bourgeoisie and has now become the chief executor of the bloody aggressive conspiracy of US imperialism to use Europeans to fight Europeans and Asians to fight Asians.
    Having the Rhee Syngman reactionay group organize puppet armies and forcing Koreans to fight Koreans is the most concrete manifestation of US imperialism's bloody aggressive policy of using Asians to fight Asians. However, the Koreans who have been deceived and forced to fight by the Rhee Syngman reactionary group for a long time are awakening and resisting. Since the start of US imperialism's war of aggression against Korea in June 1950, there have been countless examples of soldiers of the Rhee Syngman puppet army laying down their weapons and defecting to the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers. US imperialism's conspiracy to force Koreans to fight Koreans will surely fail. The Korean people will surely win victory, win peace, and win the liberation of their motherland. Having the Yoshida reactionary group arm Japan and forcing Japanese to serve as cannon fodder is another most concrete manifestation of US imperialism's bloody policy of using Asians to fight Asians. However, US imperialism's plan to arm Japan is as fraught with difficulties as its plan to arm West Germany. After the outbreak of the US war of aggression against Korea, MacArthur ordered the Yoshida government on July 8, 1950, to establish a "police reserve force" of 75,000 people and expand the personnel of the "Maritime Safety Agency" to 18,000, as the basis for rebuilding the Japanese Army and Navy. This July, the Yoshida government again expanded the "police reserve force" to 110,000 people. These plans to expand the army and prepare for war have aroused strong resistance from the Japanese people. Any conscientious and peace-loving Japanese does not want to embark on the adventurous road of slaughtering the Asian people again in order to satisfy the ambitions of US imperialism.
    It can be seen from this that US imperialism's conspiracy to create a war of aggression has been universally and resolutely opposed by the people of Europe, the people of Asia, and the people of the whole world. Therefore, even if US imperialism can force together a group of vassal armies, it is unreliable. Not only are the vassal armies unreliable, but even the US army itself is unreliable. Based on the fact that US imperialism is attempting to carry out the most unpopular and most unjust war, the US army can find no lofty war purpose other than being forced to fight and die for the US monopoly bourgeoisie. In this way, the US army will completely lose its fighting will and moral character. In this way, the US army will have irreconcilable contradictions with the vassal armies and the people of the vassal states. As a result, the difficulties that US imperialism encounters in political strategy are more serious and more difficult to solve than the difficulties it encounters in military strategy.
    When Eisenhower, the chief executor of US imperialism's aggressive war policy, openly incites Europeans to fight Europeans, Asians to fight Asians, and Europeans to fight Asians, Asians to fight Europeans, all Europeans should unite and never kill each other; all Asians should unite and never kill each other. Today, the key to defending peace is completely in the hands of the people of Europe, the people of Asia, and the people of the whole world. US imperialism's strategic plan to conquer Asia, conquer Europe, and conquer the world has no foundation. As long as Europeans and Asians do not fight for US imperialism, then US imperialism's aggressive war to conquer Asia, conquer Europe, and conquer the world cannot be fought. Even if US imperialism takes crazy risks and starts fighting somewhere, because Europeans and Asians do not fight for US imperialism, it will certainly not be able to continue. Even if it continues, US imperialism will surely suffer heavy losses and end in a disastrous defeat. To Eisenhower's bloody aggressive conspiracy to use Europeans to fight Europeans and Asians to fight Asians, Europeans and Asians must give the most resolute and loudest answer: Europeans do not fight Europeans, and Asians do not fight Asians. At the same time, any conscientious and peace-loving Americans will surely shout along, Americans are neither willing to attack Europeans nor willing to attack Asians. People of the world, unite, and peace will surely prevail.

    亚洲人团结起来，粉碎美帝国主义用亚洲人打亚洲人的侵略阴谋
    古田
    美帝国主义是亚洲人民、欧洲人民和全世界人民最凶恶的敌人。这一千真万确的罪状，美国新当选的总统艾森豪威尔在其竞选运动中又亲口招认了一次。根据十月三日纽约时报刊载艾森豪威尔十月二日在伊利诺州香槟城发表竞选演讲的原文，不是别人，正是这位美国新当选的总统大声叫喊：“让亚洲人打亚洲人”。美国有位名叫史东的新闻记者十月二十八日在纽约指南针日报上发表了一篇文章，这样写道：“艾森豪威尔曾经说过：‘让亚洲人去打仗’。这句话在亚洲是很难听的，在那里，这句话就意味着：‘让亚洲人当炮灰’”。不错，艾森豪威尔这句话的确难听。然而，这岂但在亚洲人的耳中难听，在欧洲人的耳中，岂不同样难听。为什么？因为，美帝国主义在亚洲的侵略政策既然是用亚洲人打亚洲人，可想而知，美帝国主义在欧洲的侵略政策当然就是用欧洲人打欧洲人。这难道不是最合逻辑的推断吗？
    美帝国主义之所以妄想用亚洲人打亚洲人和用欧洲人打欧洲人，决不是由于一种偶然的动机，更不是由于艾森豪威尔信口胡说，而是由于美帝国主义的基本战略非如此不可。非如此则不足以发动侵略战争，发动了也不足以继续支持这种侵略战争。首先要了解一种基本情况：美帝国主义企图进行的侵略战争，拿性质来讲，是一种最不得人心的最不义的战争。同时，这还不是什么小规模的小范围的侵略战争，而是最大规模的最大范围的侵略战争，即带有全世界性的侵略战争。这种带有全世界性的侵略战争，就人类历史而言，实际上没有任何侵略国家曾经计划过。法西斯德国计划过征服欧洲，法西斯日本计划过征服亚洲。然而美帝国主义今天征服全世界的计划，可以说是法西斯德国和法西斯日本两个庞大侵略计划的合编。按照美帝国主义的侵略战争计划，势必要将欧、亚、非三洲包括在内，又势必要将大西洋、太平洋、印度洋包括在内。最后势必要将南北美洲和澳洲包括在内。这样一来，美帝国主义就势必要在全世界建立几百个基地，开辟几十个战场。任何学习过军事，参加过战争的人都不能不问，美帝国主义究竟能够拿得出来多少人力，用以实现这样一种最大规模的、最大范围的侵略战争计划。根据美国陆军部的统计，第二次世界战争中，美国最高动员数额是一千二百三十六万四千人。德国呢？在第二次世界战争中最高动员数额是一千零二十万人（包括奥国在内）。日本呢？在第二次世界战争中最高动员数额是六百零九万五千人。德日两个法西斯国家本身拥有一千六百二十九万五千人的动员数额，没有征服欧洲和亚洲，而遭受到惨败。美帝国主义本身仅仅拥有一千二百三十六万四千人的动员数额，就计划征服全世界。行吗？当然不行。再加上美帝国主义，由于国内人民反对战争，不能不害怕死人，那就更难办。正因为不行，正因为难办，美帝国主义这才想出了一条用亚洲人打亚洲人，用欧洲人打欧洲人的阴谋诡计。
    再看第二次世界战争时期美国参谋总长马歇尔于一九四五年九月提出的关于第二次世界战争的报告。在这一报告中，马歇尔替美国的人力，作了一次决算。这位参谋总长经过精确计算之后，很感慨地承认了一件事实，美国地面部队不足。按照马歇尔的估计，美国身体强壮能服兵役的人数最多只有一千五百万至一千六百万。首先海军和航运就要占去大批人员。于是只好将陆军（当时包括陆军所属空军在内）的基本数额规定为七百七十万人。一九四五年这一数额曾经增至八百三十万人。根据陆军部统计是八百二十六万六千三百七十三人。这八百三十万人，照马歇尔的计算，残弱者占五十万人，补充兵十万人。总计并未参加作战者大约为六十万人，八百三十万人减去六十万人仍然是七百七十万人。在这七百七十万人中，陆军所属空军首先占去二百三十四万人，后勤系统占去一百七十五万一千人，各战区司令部直属部队占去四十二万三千人，结果地面部队亦即野战部队只剩三百一十八万六千人。美国空军成为独立系统是一九四七年七月以后的事情。根据空军部事后统计一九四四年美国陆军所属空军为二百四十一万一千二百九十四人，比马歇尔数字多七万人。现仍以马歇尔数字为准，将陆军所属空军二百三十四万人由七百七十万陆军总数额中减去，剩下五百三十六万人。这五百三十六万人才是第二次世界战争中美国陆军的真正的基本数额。再加上马歇尔所说的残弱者五十万，补充兵十万人，构成五百九十六万人的数字。拿五百九十六万与美国在第二次世界战争中最高动员数额一千二百三十六万四千对比一下，大体上是十股占五股。空军二百三十四万，大体上是十股占两股。美国海军根据美国海军部统计在第二次世界战争中的最高数额是三百三十八万零八百一十七人，大体上是十股占三股。由此可见，美国战时总动员人数在三军中的分配是海三空二陆军五。任何学习过军事，参加过战争的人都懂得决战和占领是要靠陆军，靠地面部队，靠野战部队来进行的。恰巧美帝国主义就缺乏陆军，缺乏地面部队，缺乏野战部队。这就是致命的弱点。
    侵略朝鲜的战争对于美帝国主义而言，首先是一个最严重的政治失败，同时这又是一个最严重的军事失败。朝鲜战争不仅对于美帝国主义的陆海空部队是一次无情的考验，更加重要的，对于美帝国主义妄想征服亚洲，征服欧洲，征服全世界的战略计划是一次无情的考验。说到朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军的辉煌成就，那就不能只拿朝鲜战场上的战果本身来加以衡量，而必须拿朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军的辉煌胜利对于美帝国主义征服亚洲，征服欧洲，征服全世界这一基本战略计划的严重打击，来加以衡量。这个严重打击首先不是落在别的问题上面，恰巧又是落在美帝国主义战略计划中的人力问题上面。根据一九五二年十月二十四日朝鲜人民军最高司令部和中国人民志愿军司令部联合战绩公报：自一九五零年十月二十五日至一九五二年十月十五日，朝中部队共同毙伤俘敌军六十六万一千零三十四名，其中美国侵略军二十九万一千零十一名，李伪军三十四万八千零四十五名，英国、澳大利亚、加拿大等帮凶军一万八千五百七十八名，土耳其、法国、泰国、菲律宾、希腊等国帮凶军三千四百名。这些数目字业已完全证明朝鲜战争对于敌人有生力量杀伤之大。再拿一九五二年十月的战况来看，根据新华社朝鲜前线十五日电，朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军在十月份作战中，共同歼灭敌军六万三千八百四十一名（包括炮兵部队进行炮战毙伤敌军六千五百一十九名，狙击手毙伤敌军四千六百六十二名），其中美军二万四千八百八十四名，英军三百二十二名，法军二百三十三名，加拿大军三百一十三名，李伪军三万八千零八十九名。还要指出，自从一九五一年七月十日停战谈判开始以来，朝鲜战争业已变成了敌我双方长期对峙的阵地战。在运动战中，我们能够大量歼灭敌人有生力量。在阵地战中，我们是否同样能够大量歼灭敌人的有生力量呢？现在证明，由于朝中部队愈战愈强，我们完全能够在阵地战中大量歼灭敌人有生力量。一九五二年十月份，仅仅在金化以北上甘岭附近只有几个山头的小小战场上，在二十四天的战斗中，敌人就死伤了一万八千多人。这个数目比志愿军出国作战的第一次大捷（云山战役）歼灭敌人总数（一万三千余人）还多五千人。这就证明美帝国主义在朝鲜如果不肯停战，那就不能避免还要继续遭受有生力量的大量消耗。
    中国人民志愿军司令部发言人于中国人民志愿军入朝作战两周年前夕，在其“就朝鲜战争形势的若干问题发表谈话”中讲得好：“妄想发动世界大战的美帝国主义已经处于战略上顾此失彼的窘境。在短短二百多公里的朝鲜战线上，美军在这里的兵力占其陆军师团的三分之一，空军的五分之一以上。两年来，美国侵略者已在朝鲜战争中动用了数达一百五十万人的兵力，占其全国现有武装部队的百分之四十一。美国要打世界大战，其困难可想而知。”为了研究美帝国主义在战略上所处的窘境，我们不能不回顾一下第二次世界战争以后的情况。第二次世界战争后，美帝国主义曾经复员过。这种复员状态截至侵略朝鲜战争爆发前，大体上是保持着的。拿一九四九年的统计数字来看，根据美国陆军部、海军部、空军部的资料，这一年度美国陆军人数总计六十五万八千六百九十四名；海军人数总计四十
    一万四千一百一十名；空军人数总计四十一万九千三百四十七名。一九五零年上半年度，这些数字的变动不大。侵略朝鲜战争一来，基本情况发生变化。复员状态已被打破，局部动员状态从而出现了。根据一九五二年六月二十七日出版的“美国新闻与世界报道”杂志公开发表的数字，朝鲜战争前，美国陆军人数总计五十九万；海军人数总计三十八万；陆战队人数总计七万四千；空军人数总计四十一万
    一千；三军人数合计一百四十五万五千。朝鲜战争后，截至一九五二年上半年度止，美国陆军人数总计一百六十五万；海军人数总计八十一万三千；陆战队人数总计二十四万三千；空军人数计九十六万；三军人数合计三百六十六万六千。比侵略朝鲜战争前的一百四十五万五千人，增加了二百二十一万一千人。拿三百六十六万六千人的数额与美国在第二次世界战争中最高动员数额一千二百三十六万四千人对比一下，就可看出美帝国主义现在业已将其可能动员的参军人力，拿出了三分之一弱，四分之一强。即令照马歇尔的估计，美国在战争中可能动员到一千五百至一千六百万的数额，那么，现在也业已拿出了四分之一的参军人力。一个朝鲜战场，拿前后方合计起来，在美帝国主义的战略计划中，业已花费了一百五十万的参军人力，十个朝鲜战场，就会将美帝国主义的参军人力花光。试问在美帝国主义征服亚洲，征服欧洲，征服全世界的那种最大规模和最大范围的战略计划中，岂止十个朝鲜战场。这样看来，美帝国主义如果在战略上只靠本身的参军人力，那就无法进行侵略战争。
    在侵略计划太大，参军人力太少的情况下，于是用亚洲人打亚洲人，用欧洲人打欧洲人就成为美帝国主义的基本战略。先做将军后当总统的艾森豪威尔，在美国垄断资产阶级心目中，便是执行这一基本战略的最得宠的人物。然而，亲自领导美帝国主义欧洲仆从国家扩军备战的艾森豪威尔，在其担任北大西洋侵略军的所谓“最高司令”任内，成绩并不见佳。拿英国来讲，根据合众社一九五二年十月五日伦敦电讯，官方透露目前英国陆海空三军总数达到八十七万二千人，其中陆军四十五万三千人。拿法国来讲，根据路透社一九五二年五月十日巴黎电讯、法国国防部长普利文五月六日宣称，目前法国陆海空三军总数达到八十八万五千人，其中陆军六十四万二千人。英法是目前美帝国主义在欧洲的两大重要仆从国家，其扩军备战的困难，尚且如此，何况其他。在这里不能不提到一九五二年五月二十七日签订的所谓欧洲防务集团条约，以及所谓欧洲军的计划，这就是美帝国主义用欧洲人打欧洲人的“杰作”。武装西德也就是通过所谓欧洲防御集团，所谓欧洲军来进行的。用欧洲人打欧洲人，固然是美帝国主义的一条“出路”，但这却是美帝国主义仆从国家的一条绝路。为美帝国主义向火中取栗，对于英帝国主义而言，是一件异常烫手的事情。因此，美帝国主义制造战争，结果就等于在帝国主义集团内部制造矛盾。
    欧洲人民对于艾森豪威尔用欧洲人打欧洲人的阴谋诡计早就看穿了。一九五一年一月当艾森豪威尔到西欧“荣任”大西洋侵略军的所谓“最高司令”之际，法兰西人民，意大利人民，英国人民，荷兰人民，丹麦人民，西德人民，接二连三地举行了示威运动，高喊：“艾森豪威尔滚回去！”。艾森豪威尔滚回去了。由于执行用欧洲人打欧洲人的侵略政策获得美国垄断资产阶级的垂青，现在艾森豪威尔业已一跃而为美帝国主义用欧洲人打欧洲人和用亚洲人打亚洲人这一血腥侵略阴谋的总执行人。
    经过李承晚反动集团，组织傀儡军队，强迫朝鲜人打朝鲜人是美帝国主义用亚洲人打亚洲人这一血腥侵略政策的最具体的表现。然而长期遭受李承晚反动集团欺骗和强迫作战的朝鲜人正在觉悟，正在反抗。自从一九五零年六月美帝国主义侵略朝鲜战争开始以来，李承晚傀儡军队的士兵，放下武器，奔赴朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军，弃暗投明的例子是不胜枚举的。美帝国主义强迫朝鲜人打朝鲜人的阴谋一定会失败。朝鲜人民一定会赢得胜利，赢得和平，赢得祖国的解放。经过吉田反动集团，武装日本，强迫日本人充当炮灰，是美帝国主义用亚洲人打亚洲人这种血腥政策的又一最具体的表现。然而，美帝国主义武装日本的计划，却与武装西德的计划同样是困难重重。美国侵略朝鲜战争爆发后，麦克阿瑟曾于一九五零年七月八日下令吉田政府建立七万五千人的“警察后备队”，并将“海上保安厅”的人员扩充为一万八千人，以此作为重建日本陆海军的基础。今年七月间，吉田政府又将“警察后备队”扩充为十一万人。这些扩军备战的计划业已引起日本人民的坚强反抗。任何有良心爱和平的日本人都不愿意为了满足美帝国主义的野心，重新走上屠杀亚洲人民的冒险道路。
    由此可见，美帝国主义制造侵略战争的阴谋，业已普遍地遭受到欧洲人民，亚洲人民，以及全世界人民的坚决反对。因而，即令美帝国主义能够强迫拼凑一批仆从军队，那也是靠不住的。不但仆从军队靠不住，连美国军队本身也靠不住。基于美帝国主义企图进行的是一种最不得人心的最不义的战争，美国军队，除了被迫为美国垄断资产阶级打仗送死而外，找不出任何崇高的战争目的。这样一来，美国军队就会完全丧失战斗意志和道德品质。这样一来，美国军队就会与仆从军队，以及仆从国家的人民群众发生无法挽救的矛盾。结果，美帝国主义在政治战略上遭遇的困难，要比在军事战略上遭遇的困难，更加严重，更难解决。
    当美帝国主义侵略战争政策最高执行人艾森豪威尔公然策动用欧洲人打欧洲人，用亚洲人打亚洲人，以及用欧洲人打亚洲人，用亚洲人打欧洲人的时候，全欧洲人应该团结起来，决不要互相残杀；全亚洲人应该团结起来，决不要互相残杀。今天保卫和平的关键完全掌握在欧洲人民、亚洲人民和全世界人民自己的手中。美帝国主义企图征服亚洲，征服欧洲，征服全世界的战略计划是没有基础的。只要欧洲人和亚洲人不为美帝国主义作战，那么，美帝国主义企图征服亚洲，征服欧洲，征服全世界的侵略战争就打不起来。即令美帝国主义疯狂冒险，在什么地方打起来了，由于欧洲人和亚洲人不为美帝国主义作战，也就一定打不下去。即令打下去了，美帝国主义也就一定会打得头破血流，而归于惨败。对于艾森豪威尔用欧洲人打欧洲人，用亚洲人打亚洲人的血腥侵略阴谋，欧洲人和亚洲人都必须给予最坚决最响亮的回答：欧洲人不打欧洲人，亚洲人不打亚洲人。同时，任何有良心爱和平的美洲人一定会跟着高呼，美洲人既不愿攻打欧洲人，也不愿攻打亚洲人。全世界人民团结起来，和平一定胜利。
