    Experiences on Improving Receiving and Dispatching Work
    Editor: I have inquired about the receiving and dispatching work in many institutions. The majority of the receiving and dispatching procedures are still very complicated, and the staff always feels "busy," and have not yet overcome bureaucracy. Now I would like to introduce some experiences of the China Coal Industry Construction Equipment Company Headquarters in improving receiving and dispatching work for relevant parties to reference.
    In the past, our organization's "receiving documents" had to go through three procedures: incoming documents were sent to the external receiving and dispatching office for signing and registration once, then sent to the internal receiving and dispatching office for signing; the internal receiving and dispatching office registered them and then sent them to the clerk of the undertaking unit for signing; the clerk registered them before sending them to the person in charge, and the procedures of the archives department were not even included. After our research, the "receiving documents" registration has been changed to once. We have integrated the internal and external receiving and dispatching work with the archive work. When documents are received, the archive group duplicates two registration forms, one as the basis for internal and external receiving and dispatching and archives, and one sent to the undertaking unit with the document. Regarding "dispatching documents," originally, it had to go through five registration procedures: after the document was completed, it was handed over to the clerk of the unit for registration and sent to the archive group for signing; after being registered in the archive group, it was sent to the internal receiving and dispatching office for signing, and after registration, it was sent to the external receiving and dispatching office for signing; after being registered in the external receiving and dispatching office, the messenger signed for it, and it was registered again before being sent out. After improvement, this has been reduced to two registrations. That is, after the document is completed, the clerk of the undertaking unit duplicates two registration forms, one is stored in the unit, and one is sent to the archive group with the document, and then the internal receiving and dispatching office registers it, and it is issued. After such improvement, the comrades doing receiving and dispatching work are no longer "busy," and more importantly, the processing of official documents has been accelerated.

    关于改进收发工作的经验
    编辑同志：我打听了好多机关的收发工作的情况。大多数的收发手续还是很繁杂，工作人员总感到“忙”，仍然没有克服文牍主义。现在我想把中国煤业建筑器材公司总公司对改进收发工作的一点经验介绍出来，以供有关方面参考。
    过去，我们机关“收文”要经过三次手续：外来文件送到外收发室签收后登记一次，再送内收发室签收；内收发室登记后，又送给承办单位的文书签收；文书登记后，才送交承办人，档案部门的手续还没有算在内。我们研究后，把这样的“收文”登记已改为一次。我们把内、外收发工作和档案工作合为一体，收到文件时，由档案组复写两份登记单，一份作为内、外收发和档案的根据，一份随文件送交承办单位。关于“发文”，本来要经过五次登记手续：文件办好后，交本单位的文书登记，送档案组签收；在档案组登记后，送内收发室签收，登记后又送外收发室签收；在外收发室登记后由交通员签收，再登记后才送走。经改进后，这已减为登记两次。即文件办好后，由承办单位的文书复写两份登记单，一份存该单位，一份随文件送交档案组，然后由内收发登记，即发出。这样改进以后，做收发工作的同志们不“忙”了，更重要的是加速了公文的处理。    赵学良
