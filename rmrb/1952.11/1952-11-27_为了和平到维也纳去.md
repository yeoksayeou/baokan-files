    To Vienna for Peace
    Song Qingling, Head of the Chinese Delegation to the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference
    The Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference has concluded extremely successfully. The good wishes of the people of all countries are the cornerstone of the conference's success. What firmly binds together such a complex and broad conference is the willingness to negotiate. It is this willingness that constitutes the unprecedented great unity of the Asian and Pacific Regions in the struggle for peace, which is of great significance to the whole world as well.
    The strong relations of friendship forged in Beijing have given new strength to the struggle for peace. This conference has united the people of various countries who have long been separated by geographical distances and historical events. In Beijing, Latin Americans sat with Indians, Canadians with Burmese, Americans with Koreans, Chinese with Middle Easterners, Japanese with Mongolians, and Pakistanis with New Zealanders. They worked together, making extensive explorations of the various problems facing each country, the entire region, and the world. Because everyone earnestly hoped that the people of all countries would cooperate with each other, everyone achieved deep understanding. A concrete manifestation of this is that the peace leaders of India and Pakistan issued a joint statement, advocating that peaceful ways can and must be found to resolve the disputes between their two countries. At the same time, the conference unanimously supported the demand that the people of all countries have the right to choose their own way of life. A relationship akin to a close-knit family has emerged, which did not exist in the weeks before the meeting. This relationship elevates the effort to strive for world peace to a higher level.
    This significant contribution to peace made by the people of the Asian and Pacific Regions fills the people of all countries with hope. It strengthens their determination to resolutely confront every threat to humanity with resolute action. It greatly enhances the awareness, already rising in many countries, that while the danger of war has increased in recent months, the people have the ability and the means to change the course of events. It makes the billions of signatures already collected for the demands to ban all weapons of mass destruction, to conclude a five-power peace pact, to control and reduce armaments, to stop the remilitarization of Japan and West Germany, and to immediately stop all current wars, even more significant. In particular, it prepares the conditions for a major event of our time—the World People’s Peace Congress in Vienna.
    The representatives of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference have returned to their countries, and they are spreading among the 1.6 billion people of these regions the emotions that moved them and the important resolutions they democratically reached in Beijing. They are publicizing how everyone at the meeting sincerely advocated stopping wars and resolving differences between countries through fair and reasonable negotiations; how everyone was willing to conduct trade and cultural exchanges; how everyone universally opposed the policy of manufacturing guns when there is no bread to eat; how everyone demanded freedom for the people of all countries; how everyone wished to ease tensions, live together in friendship, and build a happy life in every country.
    These are the wishes of every good person, regardless of their views or beliefs. This wish must be expressed in every possible way, and every road must lead to the World People's Peace Congress in Vienna. The people must ensure that the work of peace, both in spirit and in substance, leaps from Beijing to Vienna, and from Vienna to the next victory.
    The people can and must save peace! (Originally published in "China Reconstructs" Issue 6, distributed by Xinhua News Agency)

    为了和平到维也纳去
    出席亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议中国代表团团长  宋庆龄
    亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议已经极为圆满地结束了。各国人民的善良愿望是会议成功的基石。把这样一个复杂而广泛的会议巩固地粘合起来的正是协商的意愿。正是这种意愿构成了亚洲及太平洋区域空前的争取和平的大团结，这种大团结对于全世界同样具有重大的意义。
    在北京结成的坚固的友谊关系使争取和平的斗争得到新的力量。这次会议使过去长期被地理的距离和历史的事件分隔开的各国人民团结起来了。在北京，拉丁美洲人跟印度人，加拿大人跟缅甸人，美国人跟朝鲜人，中国人跟中东人，日本人跟蒙古人，巴基斯坦人跟新西兰人坐在一起了。他们共同工作，对每个国家、整个区域和全世界面对的各种问题作了广泛的探讨。由于每个人都热切希望各国人民彼此合作，大家取得了深切的谅解。一个具体的表现就是：印度与巴基斯坦的和平领袖发表了联合声明，主张可以而且必须找出和平的办法来解决他们两国之间的纠纷。会议同时一致支持各国人民有权自行选定他们的生活方式的要求。亲密的一家人似的关系产生了，而这是开会的几周以前还没有的。这种关系把争取世界和平的努力提到更高的水平上。
    亚洲及太平洋区域人民对和平作的这一重大贡献使各国人民充满希望。它增强了他们以坚决的行动迎击对人类的每一种威胁的决心。它更加大大提高了在许多国家已经在提高的觉悟，使人们认识到，最近几个月来战争的危险增长了，但是人民有能力有办法改变事态的方向。它使得主张禁止一切大规模毁灭的武器、缔结五大国和平公约、管制与裁减军备、制止日本和西德的重新军国主义化和立即停止现在的一切战争这些要求所已经征集到的亿万人民的签名，更具有重大意义。尤其是，它给当代的一件大事——维也纳世界人民和平大会准备了条件。
    亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的代表已经回国，他们正在这些区域的十六亿人民中间传播着曾使他们感动的情绪和他们在北京以民主方式达成的各项重要决议。他们正在宣传着大家怎样在会上诚心诚意地主张以公平合理的谈判方式，停止战争和解决国与国之间的分歧；大家怎样愿意进行贸易，进行文化交流；大家怎样普遍反对在没有面包吃的时候却制造枪炮的政策；大家怎样要求给各国人民以自由；大家怎样愿望缓和紧张局势，友好相处，在每一个国家建设幸福的生活。
    这些都是每一个善良的人的意愿，不管他抱有怎样的见解或信仰。这种意愿必须用各种可能的方法表现出来，并使条条道路通向维也纳世界人民和平大会。人民必须保证使和平的工作，无论在精神上和在实质上，从北京跳跃到维也纳，从维也纳跳跃到下一个胜利。
    人民能够而且一定要拯救和平！（原载“中国建设”第六期，新华社发）
