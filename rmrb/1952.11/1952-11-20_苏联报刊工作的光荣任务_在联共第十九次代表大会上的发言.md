Editor's Note: Comrade Ilyichev's speech at the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union is of great educational significance not only for Soviet journalists but also for our country's journalists. We have translated and published it here. The title is added by us.

Comrades! The period from our Party's 18th Congress to the 19th Congress is a period of the greatest victory of Leninism, a triumph of the wise and farsighted policies of the Lenin-Stalin Party.

Comrade Malenkov, in his summary report on the work of the Central Committee, profoundly and clearly demonstrated that our Party, guided by Marxist-Leninist theory in its activities, has achieved victories in the past years that have further consolidated our Party, strengthened the power of the Soviet state, and enhanced its international prestige.

The summary of the struggles and victories of the Soviet people under the leadership of our Party embodies the genius of Stalin's thought and the genius of Stalin's leadership.

Stalin's work "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR" - a programmatic document of worldwide historical significance - is an outstanding event in the ideological life of the Party and the people, marking a new stage in the development of Marxist science.

When our people embarked on socialist construction and advanced along an unfamiliar road, Comrade Stalin armed the Party with a clear fighting program for winning the victory of socialism. Under new historical conditions, when the idea of realizing communism is no longer a distant prospect, Comrade Stalin gave our Party new and powerful ideological weapons for winning the victory of communism, pointing out the specific paths for building a communist society.

Our Party has always proceeded in its activities from the following unshakable Marxist proposition: new political tasks require new forms of organization, requiring more perfect organizational weapons of the Party.

The draft amendment to the Party Constitution submitted to the Congress for review reflects Comrade Stalin's further development of the theory of the Marxist Party. The Party Constitution proceeds from new political tasks and the rich experience in organizational work accumulated by our Party.

Comrade Stalin pointed out when talking about the necessity of raising the Party's organizational work to the level of the Party's political line:

"Our policy is correct, and that is where our strength lies. But to prevent our policy from becoming a mere declaration, at least two conditions are required. First, the correct selection of personnel and the verification of the implementation of Party instructions. Second, flexibility in leading the masses and high concern, concern, and more concern for the needs of the masses."

In preparation for the 19th Party Congress, a wide-ranging discussion of the draft instructions on the new Five-Year Plan and the draft amendment to the Party Constitution of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) was launched in the press and at Party meetings, delegate meetings, and congresses at all levels. The editorial department of *Pravda* received more than 12,000 letters warmly endorsing the Party Central Committee's historical documents for the 19th Party Congress. The materials on the 19th Party Congress published by *Pravda* are only a small part of the suggestions and supplements sent to the editorial department.

Such a broad discussion of major issues of Party building on the basis of full freedom of criticism, with each Party member and alternate member putting forward their affirmative and critical opinions, clearly demonstrates the vibrant strength of inner-Party democracy.

The draft amendment to the Party Constitution, which Comrade Khrushchev presented to the Congress, shows that the Leninist-Stalinist organizational principles of our Party have been further developed and are more firmly established in life.

In the arsenal of means that the Party has used in the past and continues to use to solve the various tasks it faces, our Party's press occupies a prominent position. According to Comrade Stalin's provisions, the press enables the Party to talk to the people in the language it needs every day and every hour, establishing a spiritual connection between the Party and the working people.

The strength of our press lies in the fact that the Communist Party leads it and guides all its activities. The further improvement of the mobilizing and organizing role of the press in the cause of communist construction directly depends on the level of leadership of the press by Party organs at all levels.

Thanks to the daily leadership of our Party Central Committee, our press is not only growing in quantity but also improving in quality. The Soviet Union now publishes more than 8,000 newspapers with a circulation of about 40 million copies. In addition, it publishes about 1,500 magazines and other periodicals, and more than 200 publishing houses, of which about 80 publish books in the languages of the Soviet nationalities.

For many years, thanks to the Party's concern and leadership, a well-tested and complete press system has been formed and consolidated in our country, serving the people and playing a vital role in consolidating the Party's ties with the people. Comrade Stalin instructed that the collaboration between the Party and the broad masses of working people is realized through the press.

The Soviet people regard the press as the expression of their interests, and therefore, they naturally send letters on various issues to the press, expressing their deep concern for the cause of the state. In just nine months, the central, republican, regional, and state newspapers received approximately 2.5 million letters from workers, of which nearly 250,000 were sent to the editorial department of *Pravda*.

The fact that millions of workers regularly send letters to our press demonstrates the true popular nature of the press, its connection with the masses, and its high social prestige. This is a source of life that nourishes our newspapers and magazines, enabling them to more fully and vividly reflect the diverse lives of the Soviet people.

Lenin and Stalin always emphasized the great role of the press in Party and state building and in promoting the creative initiative and spontaneity of the masses.

But our press, especially newspapers - including central newspapers - is not yet competent in this regard.

The Party Central Committee's recent resolutions on the newspapers of various districts, cities, states, republics, and the central government have pointed out serious shortcomings in newspaper work. Comrade Stalin's basic instructions on the work of *Pravda* and on measures to improve its ideological level as a leading newspaper are of great significance for our entire press. Newspapers should be concerned about all fundamental issues in social life; they have no right to avoid sharp issues and should unfold these issues more boldly, especially foreign policy issues and militant issues on the ideological front; newspapers should show initiative, should be enthusiastic propagandists of everything advanced, and should be bolder in criticizing shortcomings in work.

The editorial department of *Pravda*, implementing Comrade Stalin's instructions, has strived to focus attention on ideological issues and the work of Party organizations at all levels.

In recent years, *Pravda* has published a series of editorial articles on extremely important ideological issues: "On an Anti-Party Group of Drama Critics"; "Against Vulgarizing Literary Criticism"; "Against Ideological Distortions in Literature"; "On the Opera 'Bogdan Khmelnitsky'"; "Overcoming the Backwardness of Drama Creation." A letter from a group of readers about Vilis Lācis's novel "To the New Shore" is of fundamental significance for the development of our literature. As everyone knows, in all these articles, the notorious theory of "no conflict" was criticized, the harm of dogmatic attitudes toward literary and artistic phenomena was pointed out, and the manifestations of bourgeois nationalism in literature were struck.

The report by Comrade Malenkov analyzed in detail the serious shortcomings and mistakes in ideological work. These shortcomings also exist in the work of our press. The central newspapers - including *Pravda* - and several leading political and theoretical magazines have committed particularly serious mistakes in their work. The press should take the tasks put forward by the Party Central Committee and Comrade Stalin for ideological work as a guide in its work.

The Party and Comrade Stalin educate cadres in the spirit of correctly treating the press and using it as a vital weapon in the struggle against shortcomings in work. The Party's starting point here is that, in unfolding criticism and self-criticism from below, as Comrade Stalin pointed out, the significance of the Party and the Soviet press is truly inestimable. The All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) Central Committee educates our cadres in this spirit.

In a resolution, the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) Central Committee severely punished those in the Molotov Oblast Party Committee who suppressed criticism and attempted to cultivate a habit of flattery in the newspapers. Due to the incorrect attitude towards criticism, a bad habit of revising critical articles sent to the newspaper was formed in the oblast newspaper "Star." In the past, the leaders of the Oblast Committee deprived the newspaper of its initiative and weakened its sharpness, did not require the newspaper to be principled, but instead supported and encouraged those flattering staff members, and persecuted reporters who were sharp, principled, and criticized shortcomings without regard for face. The All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) Central Committee ordered the Molotov Oblast Party Committee to correct its attitude towards the newspaper, pointing out that this incorrect attitude towards the press would reduce the role of the press as a sharp weapon for the Party to fight against various shortcomings and would bring harm to our cause.

The staff of the Stalingrad Oblast Party Committee once prohibited the editorial department of the oblast newspaper "Stalingrad Truth" from reprinting the article in *Pravda* "They Connive at Suppressing Criticism," because in this article the Oblast Committee was criticized for not paying attention to the alarm signals of the working people. The Party Central Committee canceled this erroneous decision, explaining that such an attitude towards critical comments in the Party's newspapers would seriously harm the education of cadres.

The Party educates our Bolshevik news cadres—whose basic backbone has grown up and been educated in the last ten to fifteen years—to be good at critically estimating the achievements they have gained, to be good at seeing the shortcomings in their own work, to become models of correctly treating criticism, and to constantly enrich the forms and methods that improve the effectiveness of newspapers.

If a press organ is happy to criticize the shortcomings of others, but is unwilling to see the shortcomings in its own work, will it be respected by readers? Of course not. Why do not all press workers correctly accept criticism of themselves? First of all, because the Party organization does not educate them enough in the spirit of correctly understanding their own cause.

Not long ago, *Pravda* published an article on the work of the editorial department of the republican newspaper "Ukrainian Truth." In this article, the correct opinion was put forward that the newspaper does not support criticism from below, and sometimes even suppresses criticism. However, the editorial department of "Ukrainian Truth," which is well-known in the republic and has considerable experience, incorrectly accepted criticism, unwilling to honestly admit its mistakes, and superficially perfunctorily dealt with it.

From the podium of the 19th Party Congress, we should say that if newspaper workers can boldly unfold realistic and principled self-criticism and criticism from below, our newspapers can fulfill their lofty mission, and newspaper workers can fulfill their responsibilities. We should ruthlessly expose mistakes and shortcomings, the bad phenomena in our lives, and expose those who are hypocritical, to educate Soviet patriots in the spirit of daring to use criticism and self-criticism to overcome the old, decaying, and obstructive things and give broad space for the new and advanced things, and always remember Vladimir Ilyich Lenin's instruction: "To write about harmful things without 'anger' - that would be boring."

Press workers should remember this instruction of Comrade Stalin: "... the main thing is not to replace the 'critical' clamor from above with mass criticism from below, but to let the masses of the working class throw themselves into the cause and show creative initiative in correcting our shortcomings and improving our construction." In this regard, the role of worker-peasant correspondents should be particularly emphasized. Comrade Stalin called worker-peasant correspondents the commanders of public opinion and people who love all truth and hope to correct our shortcomings no matter what.

We, the staff of newspapers and magazines, should remember that the press is the expression of public opinion, and the mission of the press is to clearly, deeply, incisively, enthusiastically, and enjoyably promote our achievements, warmly support all new and advanced things, and awaken and unfold the creative initiative of millions of people. The Party teaches us to do this, and the Central Committee teaches us to do this.

At every stage of our country's development, the Party puts forward new tasks for the press, teaching press workers to find the main link in their activities.

The Fifth Five-Year Plan for Soviet development presents the Soviet people with exciting prospects for communist construction. The most important task of the Party and the Soviet press is to promote the Fifth Five-Year Plan, widely explain the socialist emulation of the whole people, and mobilize the creative energy of the working masses to strive to complete and overfulfill the new Stalin Five-Year Plan. Now, the role of the press as a mass organizer in socialist emulation has particularly increased.

Communist society is being built in our country. This is a society with the highest degree of culture and full development of human spiritual strength. As we advance on the road to communism, the role of the Party's ideological work and the significance of the communist education of the working people are increasing, and the foundation of the communist education of the working people is Marxism-Leninism. To be the banner-bearer of Leninism, to illuminate the phenomena of social life with the brilliance of scientific theory, and to educate the masses in the communist spirit - this is the great and honorable cause of the press that conforms to the vital interests of the Soviet people.

Comrade Stalin's theoretical work "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR" is the greatest programmatic document of scientific communism. For our press, there is no task nobler than popularizing the genius of Stalin's thought and mobilizing the working masses to realize these ideas.

The Soviet Union's advance on the road to communism exerts a tremendous influence on the international revolutionary movement and the entire course of world history. The more profoundly and effectively our press explains our country's communist construction, the better it fulfills its internationalist obligations.

The Soviet press should carry out the struggle for the cause of peace in the world, expose the conspiracies of imperialist instigators and advocates of new wars, and promote the peaceful foreign policy of the Soviet state. In accordance with Comrade Stalin's instructions, our press will strive to ensure that no remarks by the instigators of new wars will remain without due rebuff from public opinion and the press. Our press, the socialist press, is constantly exposing the tricks of the war instigators and counterattacking their deceptive propaganda, and is serving the fighters for peace in the world well.

The Party has placed a large number of press workers in the most important part of the ideological front, in the outpost of the ideological front. The noble task and ardent desire of all the staff of the Soviet press is to live up to the trust of the Communist Party and the trust of Comrade Stalin.

Comrades, Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin said twenty-five years ago:

"... we are Bolsheviks tempered by Lenin's iron Party to struggle with difficulties and overcome difficulties. ... Precisely because we are Bolsheviks, we will certainly win."

The Soviet people will certainly win in the struggle to build communism, because we are armed with the genius of Stalin's program for communist construction.

Long live the heroic Communist Party, the Party of Lenin and Stalin!

Long live our beloved leader and teacher, the great Stalin! (Prolonged applause)

    苏联报刊工作的光荣任务
    ——在联共第十九次代表大会上的发言
    编者按：伊里切夫同志在联共第十九次代表大会上的发言，不但对于苏联的报刊工作者，而且对于我国人民的报刊工作者，具有重要的教育意义。我们把它译出发表在这里。标题是我们加上的。
    同志们！从我们党第十八次代表大会到第十九次代表大会的这一时期，是列宁主义思想最伟大胜利的时期，是列宁斯大林党英明而有远见的政策的凯旋。
    马林科夫同志在关于中央工作的总结报告中深刻而且清楚地表明了，我们党在自己的活动中以马克思列宁主义理论为指针，在过去年份里取得了胜利，这些胜利更加巩固了我们的党，加强了苏维埃国家的威力，并提高了它的国际威信。
    关于苏联人民在我们党领导下所进行的斗争和取得的胜利的总结，体现了天才的斯大林思想、天才的斯大林领导。
    斯大林同志的著作《苏联社会主义经济问题》——具有全世界历史意义的纲领性的文件——是党和人民的思想生活中特出的事件，是标志着马克思主义科学发展新阶段的事件。
    当我国人民着手社会主义建设、沿着陌生道路前进的时候，斯大林同志以争取社会主义胜利的鲜明的斗争纲领武装了党。在新的历史发展条件下，当实现共产主义思想已经不是辽远前途的时候，斯大林同志给予我们党以争取共产主义胜利的新的强有力的思想武器，指出建设共产主义社会的具体途径。
    我们党在自己活动中始终是从下面这个不可摇撼的马克思主义论题出发的：新的政治任务要求新的工作组织形式，要求党的组织武器更加完善。
    在提交代表大会审查的党章修正草案中，反映了斯大林同志对马克思主义党的学说的进一步发展。党章是从新的政治任务、从我们党所积累的丰富组织工作经验出发的。
    斯大林同志在谈到必须将党的组织工作提高到党的政治路线水平时指出：
    “我们的政策是正确的，这便是我们的力量之所在。但是，要使我们的政策不致成为泡影，至少必须有两个条件。第一，正确地挑选工作人员和检查党的指示的执行情况。第二，对群众的领导的灵活性以及对群众需要的高度关怀、关怀和再关怀。”
    为了准备第十九次党代表大会，在报刊上，在各级党的会议、代表会议和代表大会上，对联共（布）中央的草案——关于新五年计划的指示草案和党章修正草案——展开了广泛的讨论。《真理报》编辑部收到了一万二千多封热烈赞成党中央关于第十九次代表大会的历史性的文件的来信。“真理报”所公布的关于第十九次党代表大会的材料，不过是送到编辑部的建议和补充的一小部分而已。
    在充分的批评自由基础上如此广泛讨论建党的重大问题，而每个党员和候补党员都提出自己肯定的和批评的意见，——这一事实本身便明显地表现出党内民主的生气勃勃的力量。
    赫鲁晓夫同志向代表大会作了报告的党章修正草案，表明我们党的列宁斯大林组织原则是进一步发展了，是在生活中更加确立了。
    在党过去一向用来和现在仍用来解决自己所面临的各种任务的手段的武库中，我们党的报刊占有着卓越的地位。依据斯大林同志的规定，报刊使党能够每日每时用自己所需要的语言同人民谈话，使党和劳动人民之间建立起精神的联系。
    我们报刊的力量就在于，共产党领导着它，指导着它的全部活动。报刊在共产主义建设事业中的动员和组织作用之进一步提高，直接取决于各级党机关对报刊的领导水平。
    由于我们党中央委员会的日常领导，我们的报刊不单在数量上增长着，而且在质量上也日益完善。苏联现在出版有八千种以上的报纸，发行额大约四千万份，另外出版有一千五百种左右的杂志和其他定期刊物，有两百多个出版机构，其中大约有八十个出版机构是用苏联各民族的语言印行书籍。
    许多年来，由于党的关怀和领导，经过考验的严整的报刊系统在我国已经形成和巩固了，它为人民服务，在巩固党与人民的联系方面起着极重要的作用。斯大林同志指示说，通过报刊实现着党与广大劳动群众间的协作。
    苏联人把报刊看作自己利益的表现者，因而很自然地，他们把各种各样问题的信件投寄报刊，以此表示对国家事业的深切关心。仅仅九个月期间，各中央、共和国、边区和州的报纸即收到大约二百五十万封劳动者的来信，其中差不多有二十五万封是投寄《真理报》编辑部的。
    千百万劳动者经常寄信给我们的报刊，这一事实表现着报刊的真正人民性、它与群众的联系及其高度社会威望。这是一种生命的源泉，滋养着我们的报纸和杂志，使它们能够更完全和更鲜明地反映苏联人多种多样的生活。
    列宁和斯大林始终强调报刊在党和国家建设方面、在发扬群众的创造主动性和自动性方面的巨大作用。
    但是我们的报刊，特别是报纸——其中也包括各中央的报纸——在这方面还不能胜任。
    最近几年党中央所通过的关于各区、市、州、共和国以及中央的报纸的各项决议中，都指出了报纸工作中的严重缺点。斯大林同志关于《真理报》的工作、关于提高其作为领导性报纸的思想水平的措施的基本指示，对于我们的整个报刊都具有巨大的意义。报纸应当关心社会生活中的一切根本问题；它没有权利避开尖锐的问题，而应当更大胆地展开这些问题，尤其是对外政策问题和思想战线上战斗性的问题；报纸应当表现主动性，应当是一切先进事物的热情宣传者，应当更大胆地批评工作中的缺点。
    《真理报》编辑部执行斯大林同志的指示，竭力集中注意于思想问题、各级党组织的工作问题。
    近几年来，《真理报》发表了一系列关于极重要思想问题的编辑部论文：《关于戏剧评论家的一个反党集团》；《反对把文学批评庸俗化》；《反对文学中的思想歪曲》；《关于歌剧〈波格丹·赫美里尼兹基〉》；《克服戏剧创作的落后现象》。一部分读者关于维利斯·拉齐斯的长篇小说“走向新海岸”所写的一封信，对于我们文学的发展具有原则性的意义。大家知道，在所有这些论文中，曾经批判了臭名昭著的没有矛盾论，指出了对文学和艺术现象的教条主义态度的危害，并且给了文学中资产阶级民族主义的表现以打击。
    在马林科夫同志的报告中曾经详细分析了思想工作中的严重缺点和错误。这些缺点在我们的报刊工作中也存在着。各中央报纸——连“真理报”也在内——以及若干领导性的政治理论杂志在自己的工作中都犯了特别重大的过失。报刊在自己的工作中应当以党中央、斯大林同志给思想工作所提出的任务为指针。
    党、斯大林同志以正确对待报刊、把它作为跟工作缺点作斗争的极重要武器的精神来教育干部。党在这里的出发点是：在展开自下而上的批评和自我批评方面，像斯大林同志所指出的，党和苏维埃报刊的意义是真正难以估量的。联共（布）中央委员会正是以这种精神来教育我们的干部。
    在联共（布）中央委员会的一个决议中，曾经严厉地处分了莫洛托夫州党委会的压制批评的人，这些人企图在报纸上培植阿谀奉迎的习气。由于对待批评的不正确态度，在州的报纸“星”中形成了一种把寄给报纸的批评文章加以涂改的恶劣作风。过去州委会的领导者剥夺了报纸的主动性并削弱了它的锋芒，不要求报纸的原则性，反而支持和鼓励那些阿谀奉迎的工作人员，迫害那些尖锐的、有原则性的、不顾情面批评缺点的记者。联共（布）中央委员会责成莫洛托夫州党委会纠正自己对报纸的态度，指出这种对报刊的不正确态度会降低报刊作为党跟各种缺点作斗争的锐利武器的作用，并给我们的事业带来损害。
    斯大林格勒州党委会的工作人员曾经禁止州报《斯大林格勒真理报》编辑部转载“真理报”的文章“他们纵容压制批评的人”，因为在这篇文章中州委会因不注意劳动人民的警号而受到了批评。党中央委员会取消了这个错误的决定，说明在党的报刊中这种对批评言论的态度会使干部教育受到严重损害。
    党教育我们的布尔什维克新闻干部——其基本骨干在最近十年至十五年已成长起来并受到了教育——要善于批判地估计所获得的成绩，善于看到自己工作中的缺点，成为正确对待批评的榜样，不断地丰富使报纸效能提高的形式和方法。
    一个报刊机关乐于批评别人的缺点，而一点不愿看到自己工作中的缺点，那末它会受到读者的尊重吗？当然不会。为什么不是所有的报刊工作人员都正确地接受对他们自己的批评意见呢？首先就因为党组织以正确理解自己事业的精神来教育他们不够的缘故。
    不久以前，“真理报”发表了一篇关于共和国报纸“乌克兰真理报”编辑部工作的文章。在这篇文章中提出了正确的意见，说该报不支持从下面来的批评，而有时简直是压制批评。但是，在共和国内有名的并有不少经验的“乌克兰真理报”编辑部，不正确地接受批评，不愿老实承认自己的错误，而从表面上敷衍过去。
    在第十九次党代表大会的讲坛上我们应当说，如果报纸工作人员能大胆地展开实事求是的原则性的自我批评和从下面来的批评，我们的报纸是能完成自己的崇高使命的，而报纸工作人员也能尽自己的职责。我们应当无情地揭露错误和缺点、我们生活中的不良现象，揭发那些伪善的人，以勇于用批评和自我批评来克服陈旧的、衰朽的和阻碍前进的事物并给新的、先进的事物以广阔的活动场所的精神来教育苏联爱国者，在这里始终要记住乌拉第米尔·伊里奇·列宁的指示：“写有害的事物而不‘愤怒’——那就会写得无聊。”
    报刊工作人员应当记住斯大林同志的这个指示：“……主要的是不要把从上面来的‘批评的’喧嚷代替从下面来的群众性的批评，要让工人阶级群众投身事业中间，并在改正我们的缺点方面、在改善我们的建设方面表现创造的主动性。”在这一方面，应当特别强调工农通讯员的作用，斯大林同志称工农通讯员是社会舆论的指挥官，是热爱一切真理、希望无论如何改正我们的缺点的人。
    我们，报纸和杂志的工作人员，应该记住：报刊是社会舆论的表达者，报刊的使命也就是明白地、深刻地、精辟地、热情地和津津有味地宣传我们的成就，热烈支持一切新的先进的事物，唤起和展开千百万人的创造主动性。党教导我们这样做，中央委员会教导我们这样做。
    在我国发展的每一阶段，党都给报刊提出新的任务，教导报刊工作人员找出自己活动的主要环节。
    第五个苏联发展五年计划，给苏联人民展示了令人兴奋的共产主义建设远景。党和苏维埃报刊的最重要任务，就是宣传第五个五年计划，广泛地阐明全民的社会主义竞赛，动员劳动群众的创造精力去争取完成和超额完成新的斯大林五年计划。现在，报刊之作为社会主义竞赛中的群众组织者的作用，特别增大了。
    共产主义社会在我国正在建设着，这是具有最高度文化并使人的精神力量获得全面发展的社会。随着我们在走向共产主义的道路上的前进，党的思想工作的作用、劳动人民的共产主义教育的意义愈加增大着，而劳动人民的共产主义教育的基础就是马克思列宁主义。作列宁主义思想的旗手，以科学理论的光辉阐明社会生活现象，以共产主义精神教育群众——这就是符合苏联人民切身利益的报刊的伟大和荣誉的事业。
    斯大林同志的理论著作“苏联社会主义经济问题”，是科学共产主义的最伟大的纲领性文件。对于我国的报刊来说，再没有比普及天才的斯大林思想、动员劳动群众来实现这些思想的任务更高贵的了。
    苏联在走向共产主义的道路上的前进，给予国际革命运动和世界历史全部进程以巨大的影响。我们的报刊愈是深刻和切实地阐明我国的共产主义建设，它就愈好地完成自己的国际主义的义务。
    苏维埃报刊应当进行争取全世界和平事业的斗争，揭穿帝国主义新战争挑拨者和鼓吹者的阴谋，宣扬苏维埃国家的和平对外政策。遵照斯大林同志的指示，我们的报刊将努力做到不让新战争鼓吹者的任何言论不受到社会舆论和报刊的应有回击而留存下来。我们的报刊，社会主义的报刊，不断地揭露战争挑拨者的诡计，给他们的欺骗宣传以反击，正在为争取全世界和平的战士们好好地服务。
    党把报刊工作人员大批安置在思想战线最重要的一个部分，安置在思想战线的前哨阵地。苏联报刊一切工作人员的崇高任务和热烈愿望，就是不辜负共产党的信任、斯大林同志的信任。
    同志们，约瑟夫·维萨里奥诺维奇·斯大林在二十五年以前曾经说过：
    “……我们是由列宁的铁的党所锻炼出来与困难作斗争和克服困难的布尔什维克。……正因为我们是布尔什维克，所以我们才一定会战胜。”
    苏联人民在建设共产主义的斗争中一定会战胜，因为我们是用天才的斯大林的共产主义建设纲领所武装起来的。
    英勇的共产党，列宁斯大林的党万岁！
    我们敬爱的领袖和导师伟大的斯大林万岁！（长时间的鼓掌）
