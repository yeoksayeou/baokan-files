Xigou Village's Three-Year Construction Plan

This spring, the farmers of Xigou Village, Ping順 County, Shanxi Province, under the leadership of the Ping順 County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Xigou Village Branch of the Chinese Communist Party, based on the instructions of the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government on strengthening old revolutionary base areas, and in combination with the actual conditions of the village, with the Li Shunda Agricultural, Forestry, and Animal Husbandry Production Cooperative as the mainstay, formulated a practical three-year construction plan. The goal is to increase the total income of the village by more than double within three years, change the face of the village, and improve the economic life and cultural level of the people in the whole village.

I. The Basic Situation of the Economic Life of the People in the Whole Village at Present: The whole village has fifty-one households, two hundred and forty-six people, and four hundred and seventy-two point five nine mu of land, with an average of one point nine mu per person. Based on an average grain yield of three hundred and seventy jin per mu in 1951, the whole village can produce a total of one hundred and seventy-four thousand eight hundred and fifty-eight jin of grain per year, equivalent to eight hundred and forty-seven point eight shi of rice; other income includes eighteen point one eight shi of rice from codonopsis pilosula, eight point five shi of rice from goat wool, twenty-three shi of rice from peach and apricot kernels, fifteen shi of rice from eggs, ten shi of rice from six pigs, and three shi of rice from peaches, totaling nine hundred and twenty-five shi four dou eight sheng of rice for the whole village, with an average of three point seven shi per person; the whole village pays over nine thousand jin of patriotic public grain, buys eight horses (using rice worth over one hundred and twenty shi), and purchases some agricultural tools and other means of production. What is actually used for consumption is less than three shi per person. That is to say, although the farmers of Xigou Village have escaped the past life of bran and vegetables, they are still not wealthy enough.

II. Based on the principle of combining solving the current difficulties in the lives of the masses with long-term construction, the three-year construction plan of Xigou Village is:

(1) In agricultural production:

	1. Increase fertilizer in large quantities, improve cultivation techniques, and concentrate all efforts to increase yield per unit area. Based on the average grain yield of three hundred and seventy jin per mu in 1951, increase the average yield by 45 percent within three years, that is, increase the average yield by one hundred and sixty-six point five jin per mu, for a total increase of seventy-eight thousand six hundred and eighty-six jin of coarse grains. Adding the original grain production, the total coarse grain production can reach two hundred and fifty-three thousand five hundred and forty-four jin, equivalent to one thousand two hundred and twenty-nine point three shi of rice; three years to build one hundred and twenty mu of beach land, and eleven mu of dry land can be turned into paddy fields due to the construction of reservoirs, the above total grain production equivalent to one hundred and forty shi of rice (of which fifty mu of beach land is not included in the grain production calculation). The total land income is equivalent to one thousand three hundred and sixty-nine point three shi of rice, and the total increase in production after three years is five hundred and twenty-one point five shi, an increase of sixty-one point five percent compared with the land income in 1951, exceeding one hundred and eighty-eight percent of the pre-war level.

	2. Vigorously utilize water sources and build water conservancy projects. Three small reservoirs will be built in three years, eleven mu of dry land will be turned into paddy fields, one water well will be dug, and three mountain gullies will be controlled.

	3. In addition to the existing agricultural tools, three 166-step plows, two windmills, and two flour mills will be added within three years, three hundred pieces of old agricultural tools will be added, and three large carts will be added.

(2) Develop forestry and appropriately divide forestry and pastoral areas. In addition to the existing 650 mu of forest slopes, another 1,000 mu will be developed in three years. In addition to the existing 22,700 trees, another 17,700 production trees and timber trees will be planted in three years, with an average of 72 trees planted alive per person, and a nursery of one mu will be built. Attention should be paid to planting various fast-growing trees. Strengthen forest protection management and implement the principle of "protecting forests where there are forests, and protecting mountains where there are no forests." Cultivate apple orchards on a large scale and develop walnuts, wild peaches, and wild apricots. The increase in income from the above within three years is equivalent to forty-two shi of millet.

(3) Vigorously develop animal husbandry and increase animal power and fertilizer. There are currently eight horses, twenty-eight cattle (including eighteen cows), and thirty-seven donkeys (including twenty-five female donkeys). In three years, one breeding horse and one breeding bull will be purchased, and three cows will be purchased to improve livestock breeds. In three years, ten horses, sixteen donkeys, and sixteen cattle will be bred, increasing the number of livestock from seventy-three to one hundred and twenty. Within three years, each household will have an average of one and a half head of female livestock. Livestock breeding can generate an income of 27,400,000 yuan, equivalent to 274 shi of rice. Develop sheep flocks, currently 185, to 900 within three years. In 1952, each person should have an average of one ewe, and in three years, each person should have four sheep. By 1954, the income from sheep flocks can be converted to 290 shi of rice. Demarcate grazing slopes and plant 30 mu of pasture. Raise pigs: currently twelve, and in 1952, each household will have one pig. Develop to one hundred in three years, with an average of two pigs per household. The income from selling pigs can be converted to 150 shi of rice. Raise chickens, and within three years, each person will have three hens, and the income from selling eggs can be converted to 50 shi of rice. The above animal husbandry income is equivalent to 764 shi of rice, more than ten times that of 1951. In total, within three years (1952 to 1954), 2,175.3 shi of millet can be earned, with an average of 8.84 shi per person, exceeding the income in 1951 by 134.9 percent. In this way, the living standards of the people in the whole village can be greatly improved.

    西沟村的三年建设计划
    今年春天，山西平顺县西沟村的农民，根据中央人民政府政务院加强老根据地工作指示，在中共平顺县委会和中共西沟村支部领导下，结合本村实际情况，以李顺达农林畜牧生产合作社为主，订出了切实可行的三年建设计划，争取在三年内使全村的总收入增加一倍多，改变全村面貌，提高全村人民群众的经济生活和文化水平。
    一、目前全村人民经济生活的基本情况：全村五十一户，二百四十六人，四百七十二点五九亩土地，每人平均一点九亩。按一九五一年每亩平均产粮三百七十斤计，全村全年可产十七万四千八百五十八斤，折米八百四十七点八石；其他收入，党参变米十八点一八石，羊绒毛变米八点五石，桃杏仁变米二十三石，鸡蛋变米十五石，六口猪变米十石，桃果变米三石，合计全村总收入折米九百二十五石四斗八升，每人平均三点七石多；全村缴爱国公粮九千多斤，买马八匹（用米约一百二十石以上），再购买一些农具等生产资料，实用在消费上的，每人平均不足三石。这就是说，西沟村的农民虽然摆脱了过去的糠菜生活，但仍不够富裕。
    二、根据解决群众当前生活困难和长期建设相结合的方针，西沟村三年建设计划是：
    （一）在农业生产上：
    1、大量增加肥料，提高耕作技术，集中一切力量，提高单位面积产量。在一九五一年每亩平均产粮三百七十斤的基础上，在三年内平均增产百分之四十五，即每亩平均增产一百六十六点五斤，总共可增产粗粮七万八千六百八十六斤，加上原产粮数，可达粗粮二十五万三千五百四十四斤，折米一千二百二十九点三石；三年修成滩地一百二十亩，十一亩旱地由于修建了水库，可变成水田，以上共产粮折米一百四十石（其中有五十亩滩地未计算产粮）。总计土地收入折米一千三百六十九点三石，三年后共可增产五百二十一点五石，比一九五一年土地收入增加百分之六十一点五，超过战前百分之一百八十八。
    2、大力利用水源，兴修水利。三年修建小型水库三处，变十一亩旱地为水地，打水井一处，闸山沟三处。
    3、除现有农具外，三年内增加一六六步犁三张，风车两架，磨面机两架，添置旧农具三百件，增加大车三辆。
    （二）发展林业，适当划分林、牧区。除现有林坡六百五十亩外，三年再发展一千亩。除现有树木二万二千七百株，三年再种生产树、木料树一万七千七百株，平均每人种活七十二株，并建苗圃一亩。注意种植各种速成树。加强护林管理，贯彻“有林护林，无林护山”的方针。大量栽培苹果林，发展核桃、山桃、山杏。以上三年内增加收入折小米四十二石。
    （三）大力发展牧畜，增加畜力和肥料。现有马八匹，牛二十八头（内有母牛十八头），驴三十七条（内有母驴二十五条），在三年内再买种马一匹，种牛一头，母牛三头，以改良牲畜品种。三年内繁殖马十匹，驴十六条，牛十六头，使牲畜由七十三头发展到一百二十头。三年内做到平均每户一头半母畜。牲畜繁殖可收入二千七百四十万元，合二百七十四石米。发展羊群，现有一百八十五只，三年内发展到九百只，一九五二年每人平均要有一只母羊，三年发展到每人四只羊。到一九五四年，羊群的收入可折米二百九十石。划定牧坡，种牧草三十亩。养猪：现有十二口，一九五二年做到每户一口猪。三年发展到一百口，平均每户二口猪。卖猪收入可折米一百五十石。喂鸡，三年内每人做到有三只母鸡，卖鸡蛋收入折米五十石。以上畜牧收入折米七百六十四石，超过一九五一年十倍多。总共三年内（一九五二年到一九五四年）可收入二千一百七十五点三石小米，每人平均达八点八四石，比一九五一年收入超过百分之一百三十四点九。这样，全村人民的生活水平就可大大提高。
