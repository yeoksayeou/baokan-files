Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, November 1st—U.S. Air Force continues to indiscriminately bomb residential areas in the suburbs of Pyongyang. On the morning of October 27th, formations of U.S. bombers dropped giant bombs on residential areas in the suburbs of Pyongyang, destroying more than ten civilian houses and cave dwellings, and killing more than two hundred elderly people, women, and children.

At approximately 3:00 AM on the 29th, seventy-two sorties of U.S. B-29 bombers carried out a three-hour-long indiscriminate bombing of residential areas to the north and northwest of Pyongyang. Many women, children, and elderly people who were sound asleep were killed or injured because they could not escape in time. Dozens of civilian houses and cave dwellings were destroyed, and crops on large tracts of land were ruined.

Prior to this, at 7:00 AM on the 23rd, a formation of thirty-seven U.S. Air Force jet fighters carried out an indiscriminate bombing of the mountainous rural areas of Yongchuan Township, Pongsan County, Hwanghae Province, killing and wounding dozens of farmers who were busy with the autumn harvest, destroying thirty-six civilian houses and large tracts of farmland.

The U.S. Air Force's atrocities in slaughtering peaceful Korean residents once again expose the savage faces of the U.S. aggressors who are singing the praises of "humanitarianism" in the United Nations General Assembly. They have aroused boundless anger among the Korean people, and their determination for revenge has become even firmer.

    美机继续滥炸平壤居民区
    【新华社平壤一日电】美国空军继续滥炸平壤市郊居民区。十月二十七日清晨，美国轰炸机编队在平壤市郊居民区投掷巨型炸弹，炸毁民房土窟十余所、炸死老人、妇女和儿童二百多人。
    二十九日晨三时许，美国B—二十九型轰炸机七十二架次，又对平壤市北方和西北方的居民区进行了三小时的狂轰滥炸。在酣睡中的妇女、儿童和老人，因躲避不及而被炸死炸伤者很多，民房土窟数十所被炸毁，大片土地的农作物被破坏。
    在此以前，二十三日上午七时，美空军喷气式战斗机三十七架的编队对黄海道凤山郡灵泉面的山区农村，肆行滥炸，炸死炸伤正在忙于秋收的农民数十人，炸毁民房三十六所和大片田地。
    美国空军屠杀朝鲜和平居民的暴行，再次暴露了在联合国大会会场内高唱“人道主义”的美国侵略者的凶残面目；并激起了朝鲜人民的无比愤怒，他们的复仇决心更加坚定。
