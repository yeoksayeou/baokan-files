    Tricycle Workers in New China
    Editor: On November 3rd, I went from Rongxian Hutong in Beijing to Huangchenggen, taking a tricycle to handle some matters at the Party Committee of the Central People's Government. After I finished my business (about twenty minutes) and came out, the tricycle worker was still waiting for me across from the main entrance. When he saw me, he returned a set of Double Arrow brand electric light razor and nail clippers that I had dropped in the tricycle. I said gratefully, "Thank you for returning them to me." He replied, "No need to thank me. Under the leadership of Chairman Mao, everyone should be honest. Comrade! Don't underestimate this little thing. Even if you didn't come out for a whole day, I would wait to return it to you, even if I couldn't pedal my tricycle." When I asked his name, he smiled and said, "It's nothing. If you really want to know, my name is Sun Xiushan, and I belong to the Dongzhimen Committee of the Tricycle Workers' Union."
    I believe that Sun Xiushan's loyal and honest style is worthy of praise.

    新中国的三轮车工人
    编辑同志：十一月三日我从北京市绒线胡同到黄城根去，乘坐三轮车，到中央人民政府党委会办事。等我把事情办完（约二十分钟）出来的时候，那个三轮车工人还在大门口的对面等着我。他看到我出来，将我刚才掉到车上的一套双箭牌电光刀和指甲刀还给我。我很感激地说：“谢谢你还给我。”他回答我说：“不要谢，在毛主席领导下的人，全要老老实实，同志！别看这个小东西，你一天不出来，我不蹬三轮也要等着把东西还你。”等我问他的姓名时，他依然笑着说：“算不了什么，如果你一定要问的话，我叫孙秀山，是属于三轮车工会东直门委员会的。”
    我认为孙秀山这种忠诚老实的作风，是值得表扬的。  张建
