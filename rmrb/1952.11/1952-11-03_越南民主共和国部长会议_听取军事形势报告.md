    The meeting heard a report from the Ministry of National Defense on the current military situation.

The situation this autumn and winter is more favorable than last year. The struggles engaged in by the people in the anti-war bases and behind French lines have also been strengthened more than before.

    The meeting then discussed the main guidelines for the government's work in 1953 and the budget for the next year, and reviewed the work of various government departments.

    The meeting discussed and approved the specific plan for the national policy of implementing the program of the National United Front, proposed by the National Committee of the Vietnam National United Front, the proposal to organize a joint association of industry and commerce, the plan proposed by the Ministry of Health to carry out a large-scale health campaign, and the plan to prevent the French army from destroying sluice gates and the construction of irrigation projects and agricultural production increase plans.
