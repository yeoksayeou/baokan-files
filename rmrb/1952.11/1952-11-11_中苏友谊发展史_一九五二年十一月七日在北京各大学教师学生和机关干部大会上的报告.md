    The Development History of Sino-Soviet Friendship
    ——Report at the Meeting of Teachers, Students, and Cadres of Beijing Universities on November 7, 1952
    Yefimov, Head of the Far Eastern History Department of the Soviet National Leningrad University

    Dear Comrades and Friends:

    Today, I am speaking to you with the utmost joy. I feel very honored to be able to speak to our Soviet people's long-tested friends, the Chinese friends, in the great capital of China, in the ancient, yet today the youngest city of China—Beijing, on this significant day of the 35th anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution. First of all, on behalf of our cultural delegation, and on behalf of all the Soviet people, I would like to extend my warmest respects to the working people of Beijing and congratulate them on their new achievements in the construction of New China! Comrades! When I considered what topic I should speak to you about on the 35th anniversary of the October Revolution, I came to the conclusion without hesitation: this topic should be about the great friendship between our two peoples, about the history of this friendship. Because this kind of friendship was only possible after the success of the Great October Socialist Revolution; because this kind of friendship only entered a new and higher stage of development after the Chinese people achieved a great victory. And in these days, we are celebrating two great anniversaries: after celebrating the third anniversary of the People's Republic of China, we are celebrating the 35th anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution.

    Today, Sino-Soviet friendship has become the most powerful factor guaranteeing peace throughout the world. Therefore, it is very natural and reasonable for the historical science of the Soviet Union and China to pay more and more attention to the development history of this great friendship, to the history of the great friendship between the two peoples that has continued to develop and consolidate despite the frantic opposition of the imperialist aggressors and their running dog, the Chiang Kai-shek group.

    The Great October Socialist Revolution is the decisive condition for the emergence and development of Sino-Soviet friendship. The October Revolution ended the imperialist policy of the Tsarist regime and established the peaceful coexistence policy of all nations as the basis of the Soviet state's foreign policy. When talking about the history of the friendship between our two great peoples, one cannot fail to mention the Bolshevik Party and its great leaders, Lenin and Stalin, who, from the very day of the establishment of the Bolshevik Party, repeatedly advocated uniting the Chinese people to jointly oppose the policies of the imperialists and the policies of the Tsarist regime.

    The great Lenin condemned the imperialists who plundered China as early as 1900 and declared that Russian workers would unite with the Chinese people. The Prague Conference of the Bolshevik Party congratulated China's Xinhai Revolution and pointed out the world significance of the Chinese people's revolutionary struggle, which bore the mission of liberating Asia.

    The various principles of foreign policy determined by the Bolshevik Party before 1917 were widely and specifically embodied in the Soviet government's foreign policy after the success of the Great October Socialist Revolution. The principles of peaceful policy, national equality, and friendly cooperation among all ethnic groups are embodied in the Decree on Peace and many other extremely important diplomatic documents. These principles are known throughout the world and are very familiar to our Chinese friends. These principles are particularly well reflected in the relations between the Soviet Union and China.

    In the book "To all the Working Muslims of Russia and the East" on December 3, 1917, the Soviet government specifically stipulated the following basic principles of its policy towards the various ethnic groups in the East: abolish all unequal treaties, abolish extraterritoriality, abandon the plundering concessions, abolish secret treaties signed with the great powers aimed at violating the national sovereignty of the various ethnic groups in the East, and so on. This began a new era in the mutual relations between the great Russian and Chinese peoples. At that time, the young Soviet republic, in the ring of military blockade, was shaken by the domestic counter-revolutionary forces who were desperately trying to eliminate the Soviet regime, but still immediately tried to establish new relations with China on an equal and friendly basis. This is a fact of great historical significance. Regarding this issue, the Soviet government conducted negotiations with the then Chinese ambassador. Undoubtedly, if these negotiations had been successful, the entire system of imperialist oppression in China could have been fatally struck as early as 1918. However, the imperialists did everything possible to exert pressure on the Beijing government that depended on them in order to undermine the negotiations that had already begun. "The Entente suddenly strangled the throat of the Beijing government, heavily bribed the officials of the Beijing government and the Chinese press, and forced the Chinese government to sever all relations with the Russian Labor and Peasant Government." (Excerpt from the "Proclamation to the Chinese People and the Southern and Northern Governments of China" by the People's Committee on July 25, 1919)

    The imperialist powers and their Chinese running dogs and warlords vainly attempted to deceive the world and prevent the Chinese people from knowing the truth about the great victory won by the Russian workers and peasants. They built a barrier of lies to deceive the Chinese people. But all their efforts failed. The truth about the great victory broke through the obstacles created by the imperialists with lies. When talking about the main essence of the significance of the October Revolution for the Chinese people, the great leader of the Chinese people, Mao Zedong, said: "The Chinese people found the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism, and the face of China changed... The salvo of the October Revolution brought us Marxism-Leninism."

    Here, one cannot help but think of the famous words spoken by the great Chinese revolutionary Sun Yat-sen:

    "Distance does not exist for the slogans issued by Moscow. They will spread around the globe as fast as lightning and arouse a response in the hearts of every worker... We know that the Soviets will never support an unjust cause. Since the Soviets support us, it means that truth supports us, and truth cannot but triumph, and justice will inevitably defeat power."

    At that time, the entire situation in the Far East fundamentally changed due to the victory of the Soviet people and their Red Army in the struggle against the armed interventionists, the defeat of Kolchak, the liberation of Siberia, and the imminent expulsion of Japan, the United States, and other armed interventionists from the Far Eastern part of Soviet Russia. This meant that while liberating their own country, the Red Army also raised the banner of liberating the peoples of all countries, especially the Chinese people, so that they could be liberated from the power of foreign bayonets and money that enslaved the peoples of the East.

    In 1919, the Soviet government made renewed efforts to establish diplomatic relations with China. On July 25, 1919, the Soviet government issued a historically significant declaration to the entire Chinese people and the Southern and Northern governments of China, which predicted: "If the Chinese people are willing to become a free people like the Russian people, so as not to fall into the misfortune prepared by the Entente in Versailles, which would make China a second Korea or a second India, then they should understand that their only ally and brother in the struggle for freedom is the workers, peasants, and Red Army of Russia."

    The Chinese people, led by the outstanding sons and daughters of China, were very aware of this. At first, the most advanced representatives of the Chinese people, and later, increasingly broad strata, began to recognize that a new and powerful force like Soviet Russia had emerged in the world. Friendship with Soviet Russia and Soviet Russia's assistance could play a very significant role in the Chinese people's long-term struggle for freedom and independence. The "May Fourth" Movement ushered in a new era in Chinese history. Because, as Chairman Mao said: "The May Fourth Movement occurred under the call of the world revolution at that time, under the call of the Russian revolution, and under the call of Lenin."

    The persistent struggle waged by all progressive forces in China, led by the Communist Party, and the activities of Sun Yat-sen were powerful factors that made the Chinese people increasingly sympathetic to the Soviet people. At that time, the warlord government, under pressure from the masses, had to start negotiations with the Soviet government. The Soviet people know and clearly remember how warmly and friendly the Chinese people welcomed the first group of Soviet people who came to China, and how warmly and friendly Beijing welcomed the first group of Soviet people who came to China. In 1922, the US imperialists further tightened the chains of imperialist oppression at the Washington Conference. The "Open Door" policy, which was widely publicized again in Washington, was a policy of further strengthening imperialist rule in China, and primarily a policy of the most powerful of the imperialist countries—the United States—to plunder and enslave China. But at this time, China was no longer isolated and helpless, and it could already receive assistance and support from Soviet Russia on the international stage. At that time, the warlord government that dominated everything in Beijing (and later the government that dominated everything in Nanjing) had to negotiate with the Soviet Union under pressure from the masses. In March 1924, the Sino-Soviet negotiations were almost completed successfully, and agreements had been reached on all clauses. But when the imperialists heard this news, they did everything possible to sabotage the agreement. The US government and the French government used the most despicable means to sabotage the agreement. The warlord government also bowed to them. But their supposed victory turned out to be their defeat. On May 31, 1924, the Soviet Union and China signed an agreement. This was the first equal treaty China had signed in decades of the 19th and 20th centuries. This treaty meant that China could always receive enthusiastic assistance from the Soviet Union in the struggle to win the right to decide its own destiny, that is, in international relations; the era of China's isolation on the international stage had passed. This treaty is an example of how all international issues can be resolved in a friendly manner under conditions that are beneficial to both parties. This is in line with the Leninist-Stalinist principles of Soviet foreign policy.

    The history of relations between the Soviet Union and China before the great victory of the Chinese people in 1949, that is, before the establishment of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, proves that although the reactionary rulers of China had signed agreements and treaties with the Soviet Union, they actually continued to pursue an anti-Soviet policy and tried their best to hinder the rapprochement between the two peoples.

    But their efforts failed to undermine the friendship between our two peoples. During the First Revolutionary Civil War in China, our two peoples became closer and friendlier. In those years, two policies became more evident: one was the policy of the imperialists, who carried out armed intervention against the Chinese people, shot and killed people in Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Nanjing, and bought over the warlords and the Chiang Kai-shek group; the other was the policy of the Soviet Union, which supported the Chinese people's revolutionary struggle. As early as September 1924, in response to the concentration of imperialist navies in the Shanghai area and in response to the ultimatum issued by Britain to Sun Yat-sen, Soviet laborers formed the "No Intervention in China" group, and the Soviet working people watched the heroic struggle of the Chinese people with enthusiasm. Comrade Stalin powerfully and clearly expressed our attitude towards the Chinese people's struggle. He said in December 1925: "Truth and justice are entirely on the side of the Chinese revolution. That is why we sympathize now and will sympathize in the future with the Chinese revolution, which is fighting to liberate the Chinese people from the shackles of imperialism and to unify China into one country. Whoever fails to estimate this force now and in the future is bound to fail." ("Complete Works of Stalin," Volume 7, pages 243-244)

    The result was exactly as Comrade Stalin said. The Chinese people's just cause was victorious!

    Comrade Stalin's writings on the Chinese revolution were the most important factor in helping the Chinese people. In his writings, Comrade Stalin profoundly analyzed the nature and dynamics of the Chinese revolution, the significance of the land revolution and armed struggle, and the prospects for the development of the revolution. The First Revolutionary Civil War in China showed all the working people of China that the Soviet Union was their most reliable friend. Comrade Liu Shaoqi said: "Under the leadership of the great Lenin and Stalin, the Soviet people implemented an unprecedented friendly policy towards the Chinese people, and the Chinese people began to accept the friendship of the Soviet people and the Soviet government with an unprecedented friendly attitude."

    The Kuomintang reactionaries—the agents of the imperialist powers, the running dogs of US imperialism, Chiang Kai-shek—carried out countless provocations against the Soviet Union, severed diplomatic relations with our country, and attempted to undermine the friendship between the Soviet and Chinese peoples. But all their conspiracies and tricks were defeated, because they could not deceive the hundreds of millions of Chinese people. Representing the will of China were not the Kuomintang rulers in Nanjing, but the sons and daughters of the people, led by Mao Zedong, who raised the red flag in Nanchang and Jinggangshan, fought north and south, traveled all over the country, underwent great trials, and finally brought the red flag to Beijing.

    The Chiang Kai-shek government's anti-Soviet policy, to a large extent, promoted the occurrence of the "September 18th" Incident in 1931. The Soviet government resolutely condemned Japan's aggression against China. At the same time, the fact that the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Communist Party, carried out a heroic war of resistance against Japan, and the fact that the Soviet Union resolutely took a stand against Japanese aggression, clearly proved what Comrade Stalin said at the time: Japanese imperialism had no and could have no future in China. The result was as the great Stalin said. In mid-December 1932, the Kuomintang government was forced to restore diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, although the Kuomintang government implemented a two-faced, hypocritical policy, the Chinese people were still carrying out a just war of liberation. Therefore, the Soviet Union gave China great assistance.

    Comrade Mao Zedong said:

    "Since the War of Resistance Against Japan, no imperialist government has truly helped us, only the Soviet Union has helped us with the air force and materials...

    Stalin is a faithful friend of the Chinese people's cause of liberation. The Chinese people's respect and love for Stalin and their friendship with the Soviet Union are entirely sincere..."

    Dear Comrades! We heard in China that there are graves of Soviet martyrs in Hankou who sacrificed their lives in the War of Resistance Against Japan. The Soviet soldiers who dedicated their lives to the Chinese people will be immortal! The glorious sons and daughters of the Chinese people who sacrificed their lives in the struggle for the happiness of their motherland will be immortal!

    During the severe days of World War II and the Great Patriotic War, we clearly knew that Mao Zedong's and Zhu De's soldiers were fighting alongside us against the invaders. At the same time, no matter how the rulers in Chongqing tried to sow discord, the Chinese people clearly knew that the Soviet Union's victory was of great help to the Chinese people who were engaged in a just struggle. In the unforgettable days of August 1945, the Soviet army dealt a fatal blow to the Japanese invaders in China. In those days, who fought alongside our army? Only the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army, they participated in the decisive battles. Therefore, the blood shed by Soviet and Chinese soldiers on the battlefield further consolidated our great friendship.

    The Soviet Union has always been friendly to the Chinese people. When the Chinese people were in the most difficult days due to the invasion of Japanese aggressors, the Soviet Union proved this with facts. The Soviet Union proved in fact that it has great respect for the sovereignty and national dignity of other countries.

    The Soviet Union recognized the People's Republic of China the day after the Chinese people won the great victory, which was only natural. Since then, the friendship between our two peoples has entered a new and higher stage.

    The establishment of the People's Government in China also means that a fundamentally new situation has been created in the Far East: now, the people and government of China are completely consistent in their policy of taking unified action with all democratic and peace-loving countries, especially with the Soviet Union, in the struggle to consolidate China's independent position.

    The Soviet people regard the great victory of the Chinese people, that is, the great victory won under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party headed by Chairman Mao Zedong, as their own grand festival. The Soviet people feel sincerely excited because the great Chinese people have forever gotten rid of the shackles of imperialist enslavement, have defeated the United States and all other imperialists, have eliminated feudal bonds, have established a powerful and independent country, and have opened up avenues for developing all their creative talents. On the land with nearly a quarter of the world's population, the sun of a new life has risen.

    The Soviet Union is a powerful country. The Soviet Communist Party is a great force. But this does not mean that we no longer need support.

    Comrade Stalin said:

    "Our party and our country have always needed and will continue to need the trust, sympathy, and support of the brotherly peoples abroad."

    The great victory won by the Chinese people in 1949 has created infinitely powerful conditions for developing mutual trust, sympathy, and support between the peoples of the Soviet Union and China.

    Comrade Stalin said:

    "Now, from China and Korea to Czechoslovakia and Hungary, a new 'shock force' in the form of people's democratic countries has emerged—now it is easier for our party to fight, and this work is done more vigorously."

    Chairman Mao Zedong's visit to Moscow from December 1949 to February 1950 strongly demonstrated our great friendship, demonstrating the unity of our actions and determination in the struggle against war instigators and for peace and the security of all peoples in the world.

    The Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance signed on February 14, 1950, and several other agreements, are a huge contribution to the cause of peace and the security of all peoples. These treaties and agreements are a serious warning to all war instigators, showing that 700 million people are determined to resist any attempt to launch a war. These treaties and agreements prove that the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China have joined hands side by side, and will continue to fight for the happiness of the entire progressive humanity in the future, to make our common enemies tremble with fear. The greatest significance of these treaties and agreements lies in that they consolidate and develop the fraternal friendship between the peoples of the Soviet Union and China, thus creating absolutely favorable conditions for the cause of world peace.

    In the three years since the Chinese people won the great victory, the friendship between the Soviet Union and China has been developing and consolidating at full speed. Our political, economic, and cultural ties are constantly developing and consolidating. The Soviet Union and China have exchanged dozens of delegations, visiting each other. The Soviet Union has translated hundreds of Chinese books, among which the works of Comrade Mao Zedong should be pointed out first. China has published a large number of Soviet books. It should be specifically mentioned here that the activities of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association have played a great role in strengthening the friendship between our two peoples.

    The negotiations conducted in Moscow this autumn once again clearly demonstrated the great Sino-Soviet friendship. As a result of the negotiations, the Sino-Soviet announcement on the transfer of the Chinese Changchun Railway to the Government of the People's Republic of China and the exchange of letters on the extension of the term for the joint use of the Chinese Lushunkou Naval Base were announced. The Soviet people warmly welcomed these agreements reached during the negotiations, considering them as a guarantee for further developing and consolidating the brotherly friendship between the peoples of the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China.

    Chairman Mao Zedong said when talking about the development of this friendship: "The Soviet government and people... have given the Chinese government and people enthusiastic and generous assistance, which has greatly helped the recovery and development of the new Chinese economy and the consolidation of the country."

    Sino-Soviet friendship is built on the basis of our common and vital interests in striving for peace, striving for the prosperity of our two countries, and striving for the best future for all mankind. Sino-Soviet friendship is unshakable and unbreakable. This friendship will not only continue for twenty-five years, not only continue for fifty years, but will continue forever. No force in the world can break up this friendship, and this friendship is manifested in many ways. It is manifested in the fact that our experts come to China to participate in the work, it is manifested in the various treaties signed between our two countries, it is manifested in the joyous gatherings of Chinese comrades in the Soviet Union, and it is also manifested in the words "Soviet Union" that children say to their mothers after seeing us. The alliance formed by the peoples of the two countries, which account for one-third of the earth's population, is an unprecedented undertaking in human history. This alliance is indestructible, this alliance is invincible. No threat from any war instigator can intimidate it. It is a guarantee of the victory of the great cause of defending world peace. The best future of mankind depends on the strength and consolidation of this alliance! All the oppressed people of the world regard Moscow and Beijing as a guarantee for their path to the best future.

    May the friendship between the peoples of the two great powers, the Soviet Union and China, be forever consolidated!

    May new buildings appear everywhere on the ancient Chinese land that has been awakened by the Chinese Communist Party and is building a new life!

    Long live the youth of the new China's life!

    Long live the victory of the Soviet Union's communist construction!

    Long live the great Chinese people and their great leader, Chairman Mao Zedong!

    Long live the great Soviet people who are building communism!

    Long live our mentor, the leader of all progressive humanity, the great Stalin!

    中苏友谊发展史
    ——一九五二年十一月七日在北京各大学教师学生和机关干部大会上的报告
    苏联国立列宁格勒大学远东历史系主任  叶菲莫夫亲爱的同志们，朋友们：
    今天，我怀着最愉快的心情来向诸位讲话，我感到非常荣幸，因为我能在伟大的十月社会主义革命三十五周年的这个意义重大的日子，在中国的伟大首都，在古老的、而今天是中国最年轻的城市———北京，向我们苏联人民的久经考验的朋友——中国朋友讲话。首先我要代表我们的文化工作者代表团，代表全体苏联人民，向北京的劳动者致以最热烈的敬意，并祝贺他们在新中国的建设中获得新的成就！同志们！当我考虑到，在十月革命三十五周年纪念日，我应该对诸位讲什么题目的时候，我毫不迟疑地得出一个结论：这题目应该是关于我们两国人民的伟大友谊，关于这友谊的历史。因为这种友谊只有在伟大的十月社会主义革命成功之后，才有可能实现；因为这种友谊只有在中国人民获得伟大胜利之后，才进入新的更高的发展阶段。而在目前这些日子里，我们正是庆祝两个伟大的纪念日：在庆祝了中华人民共和国三周年之后，接着又庆祝伟大的十月社会主义革命三十五周年。
    现今，苏中友好已经成为保障全世界和平的最强有力的因素。因此苏联与中国的历史科学对于这个伟大友谊的发展历史，对于尽管遭到帝国主义侵略者及其走狗蒋介石集团的疯狂反对但仍不断发展和巩固的两国人民伟大友谊历史，越来越加重视，是非常自然的，合乎情理的。
    伟大的十月社会主义革命是苏中友好的产生和发展的决定性的条件。十月革命结束了沙皇政权的帝国主义政策，并以各国人民和平相处的和平政策作为苏维埃国家对外政策的基础。在谈到我们两国伟大人民的友谊的历史时，就不能不提到布尔什维克党及其伟大的领袖列宁、斯大林，他们从布尔什维克党一成立的日子起，便一再主张，要联合中国人民共同反对帝国主义者的政策，反对沙皇政权的政策。
    伟大的列宁远在一九○○年就谴责掠夺中国的帝国主义者，宣布俄国劳动者将与中国人民团结在一起。布尔什维克党的布拉格会议祝贺中国的辛亥革命，并指出中国人民负有解放亚洲使命的革命斗争的世界意义。
    布尔什维克党早在一九一七年以前所确定的对外政策的各项原则，在伟大的十月社会主义革命成功之后，在苏联政府的对外政策上广泛而具体地体现出来了。和平法令以及其他许多极重要的外交文件中都体现了和平政策、民族平等、各族人民友谊合作等原则。这些原则是举世皆知的，也是我们的中国朋友们非常熟悉的。这些原则在苏中两国的关系上体现得特别出色。
    苏维埃政府在一九一七年十二月三日告俄国及东方回民劳动者书中，专门规定了它对东方各民族的政策的以下基本原则：废除一切不平等条约，取消治外法权，放弃强盗性的租界，废除与列强之间所签订的旨在侵犯东方各民族国家主权的秘密条约等等。这样便在伟大的俄中两国人民的相互关系上开始了新的纪元。那时年轻的苏维埃共和国，在军事封锁的火圈之中被拚命企图消灭苏维埃政权的国内反革命势力所震动，但是仍旧立刻设法和中国在平等友好的基础上建立新的关系。这是一件具有极大历史意义的事实。关于这个问题，苏维埃政府曾与当时中国大使进行谈判。无疑的，假使这次谈判能够成功，那么，早在一九一八年就能给予帝国主义压迫中国的整个体系以致命的打击了。但是帝国主义者则用尽一切办法，对依赖它们的北京政府施用压力，来破坏已经开始的谈判。“协约国突然扼住了北京政府的咽喉，重贿了北京政府的官员和中国的报界，并迫使中国政府与俄国劳农政府断绝一切关系。”（摘自一九一九年七月二十五日人民委员会致中国人民及中国南方政府与北方政府书）
    帝国主义列强及其中国的走狗和军阀们妄想一手遮天，不让中国人民晓得俄国工农获得了伟大胜利的真情。他们筑起谎言的壁障，以欺骗中国人民。但是他们的一切努力都落空了。伟大胜利的真情冲破了帝国主义用谎言造成的障碍。中国人民伟大的领袖毛泽东在谈到十月革命对于中国人民的意义的主要实质时说道：“中国人找到了马克思列宁主义这个放之四海而皆准的普遍真理，中国的面目就起了变化了。……十月革命一声炮响，给我们送来了马克思列宁主义。”
    在这里，使人不得不想起中国伟大革命家孙中山说过的有名的话：
    “对于莫斯科所发出的口号来说，距离是不存在的，它们会像闪电一样迅速地传遍全球，并在每个劳动者的心中引起反应……我们知道，苏维埃永远不会拥护非正义的事业。既然苏维埃支持我们，那意思就是说真理支持我们，而真理是不能不取得胜利的，公理必然战胜强权。”
    当时，由于苏维埃人民及其红军对武装干涉者的斗争取得了胜利，高尔察克被击溃，西伯利亚得到解放，日本、美国及其他武装干涉者快要被驱逐出苏俄的远东部分，就根本改变了远东的整个局势。这也就是说：红军在解放自己国土的同时，也举起了各国人民解放、首先是中国人民解放的旗帜，使他们能从那奴役东方各国人民的外国刺刀和金钱的势力下解放出来。
    一九一九年，苏维埃政府再度努力争取与中国建立外交关系。一九一九年七月二十五日，苏维埃政府向全中国人民及中国的南方政府和北方政府发出了具有历史意义的宣言，在这个宣言中预言到：“如果中国人民愿意像俄国人民一样成为自由的人民，以免陷入协约国在凡尔赛所准备好的那种要使中国成为朝鲜第二或印度第二的厄运，那么他们就应当了解，他们在争取自由的斗争中唯一的同盟者和兄弟，就是俄国的工人农民和红军”。
    中国的优秀儿女所领导的中国人民是非常了解这一点的。起初是中国人民的最先进的代表，而后来则有越来越广泛的阶层都开始认清：世界上已经出现了苏俄这样一个新的强大的力量。同苏俄友好以及苏俄的援助对于中国人民争取自由、独立的长期斗争，是能够起非常重大的作用的。“五四”运动揭开了中国历史的新纪元。因为，正如毛主席所说：“五四运动是在当时世界革命号召之下，是在俄国革命号召之下，是在列宁号召之下发生的。”
    以共产党为首的中国一切进步力量所进行的持久的斗争，孙中山的活动，都是使中国人民愈益同情苏维埃人民的有力因素。当时军阀政府在群众的压力下不得不开始与苏维埃政府进行谈判。苏维埃人民知道并且清楚地记得：中国怎样热情和友好地欢迎了第一批到中国来的苏维埃人，北京是怎样热情和友谊地欢迎了第一批到中国来的苏维埃人。一九二二年，美帝国主义者在华盛顿会议上更加扭紧了帝国主义压迫的锁链。在华盛顿又重新大肆宣传的“门户开放”政策是帝国主义进一步加强在华统治的政策，首先是帝国主义国家中最强大的一个——美国掠夺和奴役中国的政策。但是这时中国已经不是孤立无援的了，它在国际舞台上已经可以从苏俄那里得到援助和支持。当时在北京宰制一切的军阀政府（以后在南京宰制一切的政府也是一样）在群众的压力下，不得不同苏联进行谈判。一九二四年三月，苏中谈判几乎就要胜利完成，在一切条款上都已达成了协议。但是当帝国主义者听到了这个消息之后，便用尽一切方法破坏协议。美国政府和法国政府用最卑鄙的手段来破坏协议。军阀政府也就在它们面前俯首就范了。但是它们这种假想中的胜利原来就是它们的失败。一九二四年五月三十一日，苏中两国签订了协定。这是中国在十九——二十世纪的数十年中所签订的第一个平等条约。这个条约意味着中国在争取自己决定自己命运的权利的斗争中，就是在国际关系上也能永远从苏联那里得到热情的援助；中国在国际舞台上孤立的时代已经一去不返了。这个条约是一个范例，说明一切国际问题都能用友好的方法在对双方都有利的条件下求得解决。这是同苏联对外政策中列宁、斯大林的原则相符合的。
    一九四九年中国人民取得伟大胜利以前，即中华人民共和国中央人民政府成立以前，苏中两国关系的历史证明，当时中国反动统治者虽与苏联签订有协定和条约，却在实际上继续进行反苏政策，极力来妨碍两国人民的接近。
    但是他们的这种努力，没有能够破坏我们两国人民的友谊。在中国第一次国内革命战争时期，我们两国人民是更加亲近，更加友好了。在那些年份，两种政策表现得更加明显了：一种是帝国主义者的政策，对中国人民进行武装干涉，枪杀上海、广州、南京的人民，收买军阀和蒋介石集团的政策；另一种是苏联的政策，支持中国人民革命斗争的政策。远在一九二四年九月，为了回答帝国主义海军在上海地区集中，以及回答英国向孙中山提出的最后通牒，苏联劳动者成立了“不准干涉中国”的团体，苏联劳动人民满怀热忱地注视着中国人民的英勇斗争。斯大林同志曾有力而明确地表示了我们对中国人民斗争的态度。他在一九二五年十二月说过：“真理和正义完全是在中国革命方面。这就是为什么我们现在和将来都同情中国革命，它正在为了把中国人民从帝国主义羁绊下解放出来并且为了把中国统一成为一个国家而斗争着。谁要是现在和将来不估计到这个力量，谁就一定要失败的。”（“斯大林全集”第七卷，第二四三——二四四页）
    事情的结果正是像斯大林同志所说的那样。中国人民的正义的事业胜利了！
    斯大林同志关于中国革命问题的著作是我们帮助中国人民最重要的因素。斯大林同志在他的著作中，深刻的分析了中国革命性质和动力的问题，土地革命和武装斗争的意义，革命发展的前途。中国第一次国内革命战争向中国的全体劳动者表明了，苏联是他们最可靠的朋友。刘少奇同志说：“苏联人民就在伟大的列宁和斯大林领导之下对中国人民实行了从来未有的友好的政策，而中国的人民也就开始以从来未有的友好态度来接受苏联人民和苏联政府的友谊。”
    国民党反动派——帝国主义列强的代理人，美国帝国主义的走狗蒋介石对苏联进行了无数次的挑衅行为，他们对我国断绝了外交关系，他们企图破坏苏中两国人民的友谊。但是，他们的一切阴谋诡计都遭到了失败，因为他们欺瞒不了亿万的中国人民。代表中国意志的不是南京的国民党统治者，而是以毛泽东为首的人民的儿女，他们在南昌和井冈山举起了红旗，南征北战，走遍全国，历经伟大的考验，而终于把红旗带到了北京城。
    蒋介石政府的反苏政策在不少的程度上促进了一九三一年“九一八”事变的发生。苏联政府坚决地谴责了日本的对华侵略。同时，中国人民在共产党领导下所进行的英勇的抗日斗争以及苏联坚决采取反对日本侵略的立场这一事实，显然证明了当时斯大林同志所说的话：日本帝国主义在中国是没有而且也不可能有前途的。结果正如伟大的斯大林所说的一样。一九三二年十二月中，国民党政府被迫地恢复了对苏外交关系。在抗日战争时期，虽然国民党政府实行了两面的、伪善的政策，但中国人民还是进行着正义的解放战争，因此，苏联给了中国以极大的帮助。
    毛泽东同志说：
    “抗日战争以来，没有一个帝国主义国家的政府真正援助我们，只有苏联是用了空军和物资援助了我们。……
    斯大林是中国人民解放事业的忠实的朋友。中国人民对于斯大林的敬爱，对于苏联的友谊，是完全出于诚意的，……”
    亲爱的同志们！我们在中国听说，在汉口有在抗日战争中牺牲的苏军烈士墓。为中国人民献出了自己生命的苏联战士们永垂不朽！在争取自己祖国幸福的战斗中牺牲的，中国人民的光荣儿女永垂不朽！
    在第二次世界大战、伟大卫国战争的严峻的日子里，我们清楚地知道，同我们并肩作战反对侵略者的还有毛泽东和朱德的战士。同时，不管重庆统治者怎样挑拨离间，中国人民还是清楚地知道，苏联的胜利对于进行正义斗争的中国人民有莫大的帮助。在一九四五年八月的难忘的日子里，苏军给与在中国的日本侵略者以致命的打击。在那些日子里，有谁同我军并肩作战呢？只有八路军和新四军，他们参与了决定性的战斗。因此，苏中战士在战场上洒的鲜血使得我们的伟大友谊更加巩固了。
    苏联向来对中国人民是友谊的。当中国人民因受到日本侵略者的进犯而处在最艰苦的日子里时，苏联用事实证明了这一点。苏联在事实上证明了，它对于他国人民的主权和民族尊严是极为尊重的。
    在中国人民获得了伟大胜利后的第二天，苏联就承认了中华人民共和国，这是理所当然的。此后，我们两国人民的友谊就进入了新的更高的阶段。
    中国建立了人民政府，这也就意味着，在远东造成了本质上新的局势：现时，中国的人民和政府在为巩固中国独立地位的斗争中，在与一切民主的、爱好和平的国家、首先是与苏联采取统一行动的自己政策中，是完全一致的。
    苏联人民把中国人民的伟大胜利，即在毛泽东主席为首的中国共产党领导下取得的伟大胜利看做自己盛大的节日。苏联人民感到衷心兴奋的，是因为伟大的中国人民永远摆脱了帝国主义奴役的桎梏，使美国及其他一切帝国主义者遭到失败，解除了封建的羁绊，建立了强大的、独立的国家，并为发挥自己所有的一切创造才能，开辟了道路。在有将近全人类四分之一人口的国土上，已经升起了新生活的太阳。
    苏联是一个强大的国家。苏联共产党是一支伟大的力量。但是，这并不是说我们再不需要支持了。
    斯大林同志讲道：
    “我们的党和我们的国家过去始终需要，而且将来仍然需要国外兄弟人民的信任、同情和支持。”
    中国人民在一九四九年所赢得的伟大胜利，为发展苏中两国人民相互间的信任、同情和支持，创造了无限有力的条件。
    斯大林同志说：
    “现在，从中国和朝鲜直到捷克斯洛伐克和匈牙利，已经出现了人民民主国家形式的新‘突击队’——现在我们的党进行斗争是比较容易了，这种工作也做得更是蓬蓬勃勃了。”
    毛泽东主席在一九四九年十二月到一九五○年二月访问莫斯科，这强有力地表明了我们的伟大的友谊，表明了在反对战争挑拨者、争取和平与世界各国人民安全的斗争中，我们的行动和决心的一致。
    一九五○年二月十四日签订的苏中友好同盟互助条约以及其他几个协定，对于争取和平与各国人民安全的事业是一个极巨大的贡献。这些条约和协定，乃是对一切战争挑拨者的严重警告，它表明七亿人民坚决对抗发动战争的任何企图。这些条约和协定证明了：苏联和中华人民共和国已经并肩携手，在将来也要为整个进步人类的幸福，为使我们的共同敌人寒胆而斗争。这些条约和协定的最伟大的意义就在于：它们巩固和发展了苏中两国人民兄弟般的友谊关系，因而对全世界的和平事业造成了绝对有利的条件。
    在中国人民取得了伟大胜利以来的三年当中，苏中的友谊一往直前地发展和巩固着。我们在政治、经济和文化方面的联系都在不断地发展和巩固。苏联和中国互派了数十次代表团，彼此访问。苏联翻译了几百种中文书籍，其中应当首先指出的是毛泽东同志的著作。中国出版了大量的苏联书籍。这里要特别说到，中苏友好协会的活动在加强我们两国人民的友谊方面是起了很大的作用的。
    今年秋天在莫斯科进行的谈判又一次显明地表现了伟大的苏中友谊。谈判结果，公布了中苏关于中国长春铁路移交中华人民共和国政府的公告，关于延长共同使用中国旅顺口海军根据地期限的换文。苏联人民热烈地欢迎谈判过程中所达成的这些协定，认为这是进一步发展和巩固苏联和中华人民共和国两国人民的兄弟友谊的保证。
    毛泽东主席在谈到这种友谊的发展时说：“苏联政府和人民……给予中国政府和人民热诚的、慷慨的援助，这些援助大大帮助了新中国经济的恢复和发展及国家的巩固”。
    苏中友谊是建立在我们争取和平，争取我们两国的昌盛，争取全人类最美好的未来这一共同的切身利益的基础上的。苏中友谊是不可动摇的，是牢不可破的，这种友谊不只将继续二十五年，不只将继续五十年，而是要永远继续下去的，世界上任何力量也拆散不了这种友谊，而这一友谊的表现是多种多样的。它表现在：我们的专家到中国来参加工作这点上，表现在我们两国签订的各种条约上，表现在中国同志在苏联的欢乐聚会上，也表现在儿童看到我们后对妈妈所说的“苏联”这两个字上。人口占全地球三分之一的两国人民所结成的同盟是人类历史上空前的创举。这个同盟是不可摧毁的，这个同盟是不可战胜的。任何的战争挑拨者的威胁也恐吓不了它。它是保卫世界和平这一伟大事业的胜利的保证。人类最美好的未来有赖于这一同盟的坚强和巩固！全世界被压迫人民都把莫斯科和北京看成是自己走向最美好未来的保证。
    祝苏中两大国人民的友谊永远巩固！
    愿中国共产党所唤醒起来的正在建设新生活的古老的中国大地上，到处都出现新的建筑！
    新中国的生命的青春万岁！
    苏联共产主义建设的胜利万岁！
    伟大的中国人民及其伟大领袖毛泽东主席万岁！
    正在建设共产主义的伟大苏联人民万岁！
    我们的导师、全进步人类的领袖，伟大的斯大林万岁！    （新华社）
