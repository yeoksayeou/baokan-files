    "Don't Allow Them to Move Freely"
    ——Remembering the Increasingly Powerful Volunteer Army Artillery
    Volunteer Army Unit Zhou Zhonghua, Liyuan
    On the front lines, the blows our powerful artillery units are inflicting on the enemy are becoming increasingly heavy. The arrogant American invaders, who once boasted of their "artillery superiority," are now, in the face of our powerful artillery, issuing laments and wails: "Shells have turned our trenches into a strange graveyard, with the arms, legs, and heads of slain soldiers piled up like mountains." (Associated Press) On today's front lines, whenever our troops launch an attack on the enemy, or when those enemies who are ignorant of death come to offend our positions, you will see our countless shells blossoming in the enemy ranks, and also fiercely bombarding their tank groups and artillery positions, not allowing them to "move freely," not allowing them to "speak." Facing such a reality, how can the enemy not feel fear?
    In July of this year, our artillery unit, in coordination with the infantry, achieved a brilliant victory on the unnamed high ground east of Shangpu Defense in the central sector, annihilating more than 1,300 enemies. This is an outstanding example of our artillery units displaying their great power and severely punishing invading enemies.
    After countless struggles for the Shangpu Defense high ground, the enemy built tunnel fortifications and more than twenty bunkers on the reverse slope of the mountain, and also erected eighteen fortresses made of rails and sandbags on the ridge. When the enemy finished repairing these fortifications and moved into their "safe nests," our artillery units had already prepared a "rosary of artillery fire" to "send them off." On July 14th, our observers had already clearly understood the enemy's situation. On the night of the 17th, our artillery positions became tense, with many people moving back and forth on the winding mountain paths to carry shells, check wires, and carry out all preparations. The gunners had already set the scales and divisions, the shells had been loaded into the gun chambers, and people patiently waited for 21:15 to arrive.
    As a signal flare rose, our front lines and depth were shining with golden light everywhere, and the sound of artillery fire shook the mountains and valleys. This was the beginning of a six-minute artillery barrage. Dozens of cannons fired together, shells flew straight towards the unnamed high ground with a whistling sound, people could not hear the explosion of a single shell, they only heard the deafening long rumble of thunder. As the shells were continuously fired outward, people wiped their sweat, shouted slogans, and shuttled back and forth carrying shells in the flashing light of the shells being fired. In an instant, the opposite hillside caught fire, and the mountain was like a red-hot iron block. It was also like spraying fire浆, the firelight illuminated the Yigu River, and the smoke covered the stars in the southern sky...
    As soon as the artillery barrage ended, the gun muzzles turned to the enemy's artillery positions. At this time, five green signal flares had risen on the unnamed high ground, and our infantry comrades had successfully occupied the position.
    After the artillery fire extended and fired, the commander watched the enemy's front lines and depth, and as long as there was firelight there, he concentrated artillery fire to fire there. The enemy's cannons were silenced, and the enemy's firearms on the front lines were also silenced, ensuring that our infantry comrades safely reinforced the fortifications on the mountain.
    On the 18th, the enemy attempted to retaliate and organized a platoon of enemies to counterattack. What use is a platoon? A burst of shells was fired, killing and wounding a large portion of them; if a company came again, they would still have to roll back. From the 18th to the 20th, the enemy organized twenty counterattacks with two battalions of troops, but as a result, they lost more than nine hundred lives in vain. The unnamed high ground had become the enemy's "no-life" high ground.
    In addition, our artillery warriors guarding near the 270 high ground in the central sector also created a record of killing and wounding more than 180 enemies in an artillery battle.
    On June 14th, the observer saw from the gun scope that the enemy had gathered a company of troops, preparing to attack us. The comrades said: "Let's give them a 'deterrent'." They immediately fired eighteen shells at the enemy, killing and wounding more than eighty enemies. However, when the gunner was firing at the enemy, the position was discovered by the enemy's ranging machine, and the enemy's artillery began firing at our artillery position. A shrapnel shell landed in front of the fourth gun muzzle, the fourth gun commander's ears were deafened and he could not hear the commands, and the telephone operator Hu Hua immediately took the initiative to replace the fourth gun commander's command; the first gunner Yang Zhongping's nose was bleeding from the shock, but he still insisted on firing fiercely at the enemy's artillery position. Finally, he suppressed the enemy's artillery fire and killed and wounded more than 180 enemies. The ranging machine was also driven back by our anti-aircraft guns.
    There are many such artillery battles and such artillery heroes on the front lines. Each of our artillery units has its own amazing record of achievements. Take the 9th Company of the howitzer artillery unit, for example. In the battles over the past year since entering Korea, they have destroyed 8 enemy chemical mortars, 3 recoilless guns, 5 heavy guns, 1 anti-aircraft and flat-fire machine gun, 20 tanks, and 4 vehicles, killing and wounding 858 enemies. In October of last year, they also created an outstanding example of destroying 11 enemy tanks with 86 shells.
    In October of last year, the enemy's tanks often moved in twos and threes near our Chengshan position, and the soldiers gritted their teeth when they saw these guys, but the superiors had orders: "Don't fight if there are few tanks; beat them hard if there are many tanks," so the soldiers had to let them pass temporarily. The foolish enemy thought we didn't dare to beat them, so they became more and more rampant. On the morning of October 28th, the enemy drove out 42 tanks from Sichuanli, preparing to cover a regiment of enemies to attack us. The soldiers were overjoyed. After the company commander issued the order to prepare for shooting, the position immediately boiled, and bright shells were filled into the gun chambers.
    The enemy tanks were moving, but our position was silent. The stupid pigs crawled all the way to the river滩 within our second line of resistance, and then squeezed together in a plum blossom shape like turtles basking in the sun, preparing to bombard our observation post and front-line positions. Who knew that as soon as they had put on their posture to be beaten, our first row of shells exploded very close to them. The enemy tanks immediately panicked, dispersed, and fired at us. Observer Wu Jinfang calmly observed the impact point and corrected the deviation. The second row of shells hit the tank group. Then shells flew over one after another, the exploding smoke and soil rolled up layers of thick smoke, and the enemy tanks caught fire. The infantry on the mountain clapped their hands and cheered: "The tanks are surrounded! Good job!" At this time, dozens of tanks desperately fired at our observation post, the shelter of the observation post was destroyed, and Wu Jinfang immediately jumped out of the工事 and ran to a shell crater ten meters away to observe. Our artillery fire became more and more fierce, the enemy could not hold on, the tanks that could run fled desperately, and the lightly wounded tanks were dragged away. When the smoke cleared, people could clearly see that eleven tanks on the river滩 were still smoking, some had been blown up with several large holes, and some had half of their gun barrels broken, crawling there like dead turtles, motionless.
    It is no wonder that the enemy was greatly frightened by such fierce artillery fire. The soldiers said: "Everyone says that the American devils rely on artillery to eat, but I don't think their rice bowl is strong."

    “不准它们自由行动”
    ——记日益强大的志愿军炮兵
    志愿军某部　周仲华、梨园
    前线上，我强大的炮兵部队给敌人的打击，是愈来愈沉重了。曾经狂妄的吹嘘过“炮火优势”的美国侵略者，如今在我们强大炮兵的面前，却发出了悲叹和哀号：“炮弹把我们的战壕搞得像一块奇怪的墓地，被击毙的士兵们的手臂、腿和头颅堆积如山。”（美联社）在今天的前线上，每当我们的部队向敌人发起攻击，或者是那些不知死活的敌人来冒犯我们的阵地时，你都会看到我们无数的炮弹在敌群里开花；并且还猛烈地轰击着它们的坦克群和炮兵阵地，不准它们“自由行动”，不准它们“发言”。面对着这样的现实，又怎能不使敌人感到恐惧呢。
    今年七月间，我部炮兵在中线上浦防东无名高地上，配合步兵取得歼敌一千三百多名的光辉胜利。这是我们炮兵部队大显神威，痛歼犯敌的一个出色的战例。
    上浦防高地经过无数次的争夺后，敌人在山的背斜面，构筑了坑道工事和二十余个地堡，在山脊上也搭起十八个用铁轨、土袋堆成的堡垒。待敌人把这些工事修好了，并住进它们的“保险窝”里的时候，我们的炮兵部队早已给他准备好了“送葬”的
    “连珠炮”。七月十四日，我们的观测员已把敌人的情况了解得清清楚楚。十七日夜晚，我们的炮兵阵地紧张起来，许多人往来在曲折的山径上搬运炮弹，查电线，进行一切准备工作。瞄准手已定好了标尺分划，炮弹已装进了炮膛，人们耐心地等待着二十一时十五分的到来。
    随着一颗信号弹的升起，我们的前沿和纵深，到处闪着金光，炮声震撼着群山和山谷。这是六分钟的炮火急袭的开始。数十门大炮一齐开火，炮弹带着啸声直向无名高地飞去，人们听不见单个炮弹的爆炸，听见的只是震耳欲聋的长声雷鸣。随着炮弹连续不断地向外发射，人们挥着汗，高呼着口号，在发射时炮弹的闪光中，穿梭似的来回赶运着炮弹。一霎时，对面山头起火了，山头像一块烧红了的铁块。又像是在喷着火浆，火光照红了驿谷川，硝烟遮掩了南天的星星……
    火力急袭刚刚结束，炮口又转向敌人的炮兵阵地。这时无名高地上已升起了五发绿色信号弹，步兵同志们已顺利地占领阵地了。
    炮火延伸射击以后，指挥员注视着敌人的前沿和纵深，只要那里有火光，就集中炮火向那里发射。敌人的炮哑掉了，敌人前沿的火器也哑掉了，保证了我们步兵同志们安全的加固了山头上的工事。
    十八日，敌人企图报复，组织了一排敌人前来反击。一个排能顶什么用？一顿炮弹打过去，就打死打伤它一大半；再来一个连，还是得滚回去。从十八号到二十号的三天中，敌人先后以两个营的兵力，组织了二十次反击，但结果却白白送掉了九百多条性命。无名高地已变成敌人的无“命”高地了。
    另外，我守卫在中线二七○高地附近的炮兵勇士们，也创造了一次炮战杀伤敌人一百八十多名的战绩。
    六月十四日这天，观测员从炮镜中看到敌人集结了一个连的兵力，准备向我进攻。同志们说：“先给它个‘下马威’。”立即向敌发射了十八发炮弹，打死打伤敌八十余名。可是当炮手向敌打炮时，阵地被敌人校正机发现了，敌炮开始向我炮阵地射击，一发榴霰弹落在四炮火口前，四炮长耳朵被震聋，听不见口令，电话员胡华立即主动地代替了四炮长的指挥；一炮手杨忠平被震得鼻子出血，仍坚持向敌炮阵地猛烈发射。最后，终于压住了敌人的炮火，杀伤敌人一百八十多名。校正机也被我们的高射炮赶回去了。
    像这样的炮战和这样的炮兵英雄，在前线是很多的。我们每一个炮兵部队，都有着自己的惊人战绩。就拿某部榴弹炮第九连来说吧，他们在入朝一年多来的战斗中，共击毁敌化学迫击炮八门、无座力炮三门、重炮五门、高平两用机枪一挺、坦克二十辆、汽车四辆，毙伤敌八百五十八名。他们在去年十月间，又创造以八十六发炮弹，击毁敌坦克十一辆的战斗事迹的出色战例。
    去年十月，敌人的坦克时常在我城山阵地附近三三两两的行动，战士们看见这些家伙就气的咬牙切齿，可是上级有命令：“坦克少，不要打；坦克多，狠狠揍”，因而战士们只得暂时把它们放过去。愚蠢的敌人以为我们不敢揍它，便愈来愈猖狂。十月二十八日早晨，敌人从四川里开出了四十二辆坦克，准备掩护一个团的敌人向我进攻。可把战士们乐极了。连长下达了做射击准备的命令后，阵地上立刻沸腾起来，明晃晃的炮弹填进了炮膛。
    敌坦克在行进着，可是我们的阵地上却鸦雀无声。蠢猪们一直爬进到我们的第二阻击线内的河滩上，才像乌龟晒太阳似的挤在一起摆成梅花形，准备向我观测所和前沿阵地轰击。谁知它们刚刚把挨打的架子摆好，我们的第一排炮弹就在距它们很近的地方爆炸了。敌坦克当即惊慌的疏散向我方射击，观测员吴金芳沉着的观测着弹着点，修正偏差。第二排炮弹打过去，正好在坦克群里开了花。接着炮弹一发接一发的飞过去，爆炸的烟土卷着层层浓烟，敌坦克起火了。山上的步兵们在拍手欢呼：“坦克被包围了！打的好！”这时，几十辆坦克拚命向我观测所射击，观测所的掩体被打坏了，吴金芳立刻跳出工事，跑到十公尺以外的炮弹坑里观测。我们的炮火越来越猛烈，敌人支持不住，能跑的坦克没命的逃跑了，轻伤的坦克被拖着逃走了。烟雾一散，人们清楚的看到河滩上的十一辆坦克有的还在冒烟，有的身上被炸了几个大窟窿，有的炮筒被打折了一半，像死乌龟似的爬在那里一动也不动。
    像这样猛烈的炮火，难怪敌人大为心惊胆怕了。战士们说：“都说美国鬼子靠大炮吃饭，我看它这饭碗是不牢固了。”
